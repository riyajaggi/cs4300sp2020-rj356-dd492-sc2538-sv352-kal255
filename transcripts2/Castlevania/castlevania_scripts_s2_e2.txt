 [Trevor] I'm a nice person. I am. I know how to be nice. [Sypha] No, you don't. I do. I'm nice to everybody. Why are most of the stories you've told me in the last few days about you arriving somewhere and then getting punched in the face? That's because everyone else is a horrible piece of shit. - See? - What? [Sypha] So, how do we proceed? - [Alucard] Have the Speakers left? - [Trevor] Yeah. I'm sorry.

 In success, you will see them again soon, in far happier circumstances. See? He knows how to be nice. Is it true, then? The castle can travel somehow? We know the stories, but sometimes it's hard to separate myth from truth. Tell her about Dracula's castle, Alucard. Her day can't get any more ruined. - Dracula's castle moves. - [bottles rattling] How to describe it? It travels without moving. It appears at locations as if... Well, as if by magic. There has to be some way to trap it. How do we start? I want to go home.

 Have you been drinking again? Some chance. But no. I want to go home. The old Belmont estate. I was under the impression it was destroyed. Villagers, pitchforks, and torches, that sort of thing. It was. But the value of the old house wasn't the house itself. It was what was underneath it. The Belmont Hold. Our family library and trove. The collected knowledge and material of generations of Belmonts who fought the creatures of the night. That sounds interesting. Ifit survives... lfthere are solutions to the problems of finding and killing Dracula, they are in the Hold. You're guessing, though. I am guessing. I can't read or understand magic. But my family stored everything they found, including books of magic and whatever otherweird stuff they came across. I just can't do anything with it. But you two can. Fortunate indeed, then, that I chose not to kill you and eat you, Belmont. And that I decided against gutting you, flaying you, and turning you into shoes, Alucard. Such a merry band we are. I will find us a covered wagon and horses, if you two can manage not to kill each otherwhile I'm gone. Oh, please. We're not children. - Eat shit and die. - Yes, fuck you. [both chuckling] [breathes deeply] Do you believe we could find the tools to kill my father at your old home? I'll be honest with you. I don't have a better idea. I just know that right here, right now, we are under-equipped for thejob. I'm trusting you, Belmont. - Don't make me regret it. - [scoffs] Everybody regrets it in the end, Alucard. [indistinct chatter] No, no, no! Dracula will decide, not you. Threaten me all you like, I will die for him, if I don't kill you first. You do not question my loyalty. All I'm saying is that our goals can be met without gleefully paddling in the blood of children. Enough! I told you all that Hector and lsaac would guide our next steps. You will cease this infantile squabbling. I said... I said cease! I am Carmilla. I am come from far Styria tojoin the war council. Your presence was requested some time ago, Carmilla of Styria. Indeed. But your mighty castle keep moves around. And with such mighty vampire generals advising you and prosecuting yourwar, what use could you have possibly had for a mere regional ruler? And yet, my lord, your forces were repelled from a single city-state. Your generals are in disarray. So I feel that, perhaps, it is time to offer my insights to your great cause. And what insights have you, Carmilla? Whywas this newwife of yours never turned? [Dracula] What did you say? You married, you had a child, and yet you did not make her a vampire. Why was that? [Carmilla] Were you simply keeping a human pet? And if so, why is vampire society going to warwith the world over it? I will speakwith you alone. Attend me. [footsteps approaching] Yes? You wished to speak to me, my lord? That was a dramatic entrance, Carmilla. It was not meant to disrespect you. It was intended to unsettle a room full of men. I prefer in such situations to arrive with as many advantages as possible. And how is it that you're here? Godbrand has been keeping me apprised of your castle's position. Your current location was also advantageous. And why has Godbrand been in regular communication with you? I suspect he still wants to sleep with me. And will you? [giggles] My lord! From another man, that would be impossible impertinence. And yet, I prefer to know my generals' ties and compromises. I may, if all the other vampire males in the world drop dead, and half the females. Some of the animals. [chuckles] Very good, Carmilla. Speaking of impertinence, you just denounced the choice not to turn my dead wife in front of all my generals. What advantage does my anger buy you? None. It's a question they have all been asking themselves. I gave you an opportunity to address it, my lord. Oh, so you were helping. Of course, my lord. Then why have you only just arrived? You were summoned some time ago. Surely I needed help much earlier. Distractions at home. Securing my region. Villagers, pitchforks, torches, the usual. Hmm. Rejoin the others. Hector and lsaac, my forgemasters, will be directing our next moves. I'm sure theywould enjoy yourhelp. As you wish, my lord. [scoffs] [crickets chirping] [Sypha] I'm still not completely clear on why you don't catch fire in the daylight. [Alucard] I am half-human. My mother's name was Lisa, and she was mortal. I would very much like to hear the story of how that happened. [chuckles] She actually showed up at his front door. She found the castle and banged the door with the pommel of her knife. - [Sypha] She sounds interesting! - [Alucard] Oh, she was remarkable. She beat on the door until my father let her in, and then demanded he teach her how to be a doctor. Wait, Dracula taught a human woman how to be a doctor? [scoffs] What was first? Blood-letting? [laughs] God, you still think you're funny. - My father- - [Trevor] Dracula. Is a man of science, a philosopher, a scholar, and knows things our society have forgotten three times over. Do you still not understand the enormity of what we're doing? He's gone mad. And from that, there is no recovering him. Shame. [Alucard] it's a tragedy. He's a repository of centuries of learning. He could've changed the world. I think he might have, if Mother hadn't died. She'd sent him out into the world. That's why he wasn't there when the bishops took her. - She sent him away? - She sent him to travel. To learn the true state of the world, the true nature of humans and how they live. She was turning him. Imagine if he could have aimed all that knowledge at improving lives. If the religious inquisition hadn't proved true all of his worst instincts about humans. [Trevor] Now he's going to use her death as an excuse to destroy the world. Oh, the world will still be here, Belmont. Trees will still grow, birds will still sing, animals will still hump away in the undergrowth. But you won't be here. And you won't be here. None of you. The sun will still set, but you will not see it rise. There will only be Dracula, and his war council, and the hordes of the night. He writes in great books, you know. He hews the covers himself from oak, and wraps them in the preserved skin of the people who he hated most. And he writes plans. I've seen them. Ideas for darkening clouds and making them as permanent in the air as the frost of the north. Great strange flying machines that pull shrouds across the sky to block out the sun. Imagine it. Aworld without humans, under endless invented night. And Dracula in his castle, his revenge so horribly complete that there is nothing left to do but look out over a world without art or memory or laughter and know that he did his workwell. That he did it all for love. - [growling] - [leaves rustling] - Did you hear that? - Animals humping in the undergrowth. - [growling intensifies] - Wait, no. Which is the nearest town? Is it still Gresit? Arges is closer to us. [snarling] [Sypha gasps] Hmm. [exhales] [snarling] No further. [grunts] [shrieks] [screams] [grunts] [shrieks] [Trevor grunts] [snarls] [whimpers] Nobody's going to Arges tonight. [whip cracking] [grunts] [groans] You thieving little shit! [groans] I didn't steal anything. I'm trying to learn. I found you dying on the street! I gave you a home and fed you, and all you were supposed to do was work quietly and watch my back, not go behind my back and fuck around with the tools of my trade! Sneaking down here, going through my books. [lsaac] I'm sorry. [man] What did you think you were gonna learn? How-how to help you. Oh. You actually wanted to learn so you could help me do my work? Why? Because... Please don't be angrywith me anymore. Just tell me, lsaac. it's all right. Because I love you. Oh. Oh, bless your heart. Even after everything in your life, you're still a sweet boy who believes in love. I'm sorry. I just wanted to help. Well, I love you too. [grunts] [man] That's why I do this. - This is how I love you. - [lsaac continues groaning] This is how I teach you. You stop fucking around, you do as you're told, - you never use the word "love" again. - [lsaac shouts] [gasps] [grunts] No! lsaac! [screams] No such thing as love in this world. From a party sent to Arges. [Godbrand] it died 20 yards from our door. [lsaac] Arges is some distance. He must have flown all night. [whip cracking] Why do you do that? The whipping? Discipline. Peace. Choosing my own actions, and inuring myself to a world of horrors. [groans] Come on, wake up. We have a horror right here for you. [lsaac] imagine. So horribly injured, and so determined to come back to us. And crapping out a minute before it managed it. Useless fucking thing. Now, do your filthy human magic with it. I'm sorry. You struggled so hard to come back home. So loyal. Perhaps this is all loyalty buys in a world without love. Pain in the night, and death on your master's floor. Perhaps that's all that awaits me, too. But you didn't mind. You came home, regardless. The lesson here is that I shouldn't care, either. Dracula will bring a pure world into being. I believe that. I believe him. I want, of all things, a pure world. A clean world. Where there is only loyalty and only love. [footsteps approaching] You're so alone. We have to accept that we've lost the party sent to Arges. Taking Arges is bloodshed for its own sake. There is no strategy here. Arges has no real importance. You should have counselled an attack on Braila. Why Braila? If you were serious about serving our lord's war, you would've seen that taking the biggest river port town in the region was important. [Carmilla] If you take Braila, you prevent escape from Wallachia. Any city built over running water is a place that we, as vampires, should approach carefully. [lsaac] Running water? I've never heard of that affecting vampires. Death by running water hasn't happened in many centuries. [Hector] Why not? Look around. We moved into the middle of countries. I'd been told that vampires couldn't cross running water. I've been on boats. I've had baths. When? Baths aren't running water, though, are they? 'Course they are. How can baths be running water? The water's stopped being poured when you get in. The Greeks used to bury us on small islands because the graves would be surrounded by running water. I think I would probably feel like running waterwould kill me. Really? Do you feel like poison would kill you? Of course you don't. It's a thing you learn. It's not like we're given a manual for being a vampire. Enough! Do you really think that's enough, Hector? Power is what matters in this world. I do not see how securing Braila over Arges gives us power. [lsaac] Arges is an old, respected town. I must respectfully disagree with my fellow forgemaster. Taking Arges brings only terror, and will scatter the human populace. Taking Braila seals off one side of Wallachia. Interesting, Hector. I must disclose that I revived the creature that returned. The party was attacked on the road. Their assailants are unknown. [lsaac] But Arges is close to Gresit. We are quite certain that Alucard sleeps at Gresit. And that there was recently a Belmont there. A Belmont? I thought theywere extinct. No. We believe our lord's son, Alucard, and the Belmont may have worked together to repel our forces at Gresit. If there is a Belmont left alive, then should we not observe the ancestral Belmont home? Why? Perhaps on the general notion that the Belmonts hunted the likes of us for fucking centuries. And if there's one left alive, then it may have access to the trove of weapons and magical materials talked of across generations but never found, which they used to hunt us through fucking centuries. Am I making myself clear now? This is yourwar council, my lord? [voice] Frederator! BDRipped by jirro OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
