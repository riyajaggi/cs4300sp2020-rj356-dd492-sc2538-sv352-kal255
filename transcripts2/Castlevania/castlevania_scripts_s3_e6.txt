 Well, look at you. Almost human. There. Upright on your hind legs and everything. Thank you. - It's nice to be dressed again, but... - But? The thing about moving right now is that I think it'll feel nice when I stop doing it. Oh. You didn't want to go for a walk, then? - What? - Well, I could hardly take you for a walk with your bits flapping around in the open air, could I? A bird might think your penis was a twig and fly off with it. Yes. Well.

 Oh, come on. A little smile won't kill you. Good boy. Now then, would you like to go for a walk? Bit of fresh air in the starlight? I think I would, yes. Good. Sadly, there's a condition. Oh. Not my idea. Striga insisted. It should be quite comfortable. She just wanted a little extra security. You're ten times stronger than I am, Lenore. Striga pointed out that you're a magician. And you do want to go for a walk, so... would you mind?

 Fine. Good boy. Walkies! Mm. It's a lovely night, don't you think? It's a bloody chilly night. It was warmer in my cell. That's because we channel waste heat around the castle with pipes. Really? Even to the cells? I keep telling you. We're not monsters. Dracula's castle moved heat around with pipes. Is that vampire magic? Actually, just science. Centuries old. The thing is, Hector, humans forget things and vampires don't. You have a lot to learn. And will I get the chance to? So dramatic. Relax and enjoy the night. Daylight can be nice, too. I'll take your word for it. You don't remember daylight? Never much cared for it. I was always a night person. You might be missing something, you know. Only coming out at night. Oh, I don't think so. Just look. I can't see how the sun would improve this view. All right. I admit it. That's fantastic. See? It's not so bad here, is it? I could do without this. Does it hurt? No. It just reminds me of the last time someone put a collar on me. In Braila? When Carmilla almost killed me. Well, she does have a temper. But she would never have meant to kill you. No. Because she needs me to be her forgemaster slave. No, because if she'd meant to kill you, you would quite simply be dead. - Hmph. - And if she'd meant to torture you, you would have arrived here carrying your guts in both hands with a spike up your arse. I suppose that's true. I mean, I can see her doing it. In nightmares and such. She does have a temper, but she's logical. She never lets it run away with her to the point of, oh, I don't know, condemning the entire human race to death? Just a recent example of what being genuinely insane with murderous rage looks like. All right. You may not have been treated like a boy king on your way here, but you did show up alive. Might have been nice, though. Have you considered that you're only alive because you listened to Carmilla back in Dracula's castle? I hadn't. She tricked me. I don't think she did. I think she made complete sense to you, and you felt guilty, understandably, about how it all played out. She made me betray Dracula. No, she didn't. She showed you the old man was insane, and she saved you from the consequences. Nobody here wants to harm you. We just don't quite trust you yet. - Trust me? - You did try to hurt me, Hector. What's she saying about me? Lenore is saying you're a mean, nasty woman. Cheeky little tart. Is it working? Seems to be. Wait. Now he's complaining again about you. And how you beat the shit out of him. Oh, for God's sake. In hindsight, beating the shit out of him does seem like a miscalculation, since your scheme apparently won't work without him. He needed to be cowed. Lenore would have had nothing to work with if he was still a happy idiot. We do need the idiot, Carmilla. I know, I know. - But there is a problem. - What? He can turn dead bodies into night creatures. We need night creature soldiers to reinforce our military numbers. That's the plan, yes. Where do we get that many fresh dead bodies from without reducing our feeding stock to nothing? One thing at a time. Lenore has to first solve this problem for us. No. This way. New cell. In you go. Is this a trick? Am I dreaming? I thought you might like to be able to read. Pass your lead through. There. Good boy. The book, by the way, is some of our vampire magic. Given your own profession, I had a feeling you might find it interesting. Uh, thank you. Thank you very much. Can I see you tomorrow night? Yes... Uh, yes, of course. Thank you. Good night. Dream well. What did you make of him? Saint Germain? I'm not sure I'd trust him as far as I could kick him, but he's not who I thought he was on first impression. He's sad. Yeah. But he's also a confidence man. But he dropped that with us. Yeah. He did. That bothers you? A little. But you know what really bothers me? What? That maybe he's been on his own for so long that he was willing to drop the front that quickly because he that desperately needed... friends. He's that sad. That alone. Suffering under that loss. Mmm. Remind you of someone? That's a depressing thought. Yeah. I think we should help him. Of course, you do. It's the right thing to do. And we may need his help. Did we fall out of our story into someone else's story... again? Silly. It's all our story. I hope I get to live long enough to find out how it ends. N-No... Th-This is wrong... We... We shouldn't be... here. Where are you?! Are you still here?! Please! Tell me where you are! Take my hand! Please! Oh, God. I'm sure there must have been a time when I had nice dreams. Maybe when I lived in palaces and mansions? But maybe not. That was all stress. Doing my little dance for coins, making sure I had enough for the next... month, the next year. Never bloody easy, was it? And then... there was you. Did I dream when you were here? I don't know. I was too focused on our daylight hours. I never wanted to sleep in those days. And now here I am again. Never wanting to sleep. Not until I find you. Not until I live in the good dream again. Not until you're back. Where is the one who can talk well? The one with the eyes? I made you in Genoa. You mean... me? I do. Sit with me a moment. What do you wish? I was curious. The night is long and I've been given much to think about of late. May I ask a question of you? Of course. Do you remember who you were? Before you went to hell. I... almost do. It's like... I remember how it was to dream, and to remember moments of the dream, but never the entire play. Do you see? I do. What do you remember? I was a scholar. Really? I was. In a place called Athens. I think it was a long time ago. What did you study? I was a philosopher. And this was a thing that sent you to Hell? I lived as a man during a time when the empire that ruled Athens changed its religion and laws. I believed philosophy to be the study of the systems of the world and our purpose in it. And yet discussion of the nature of the divine became a crime. Who declared this a crime? Christians. To be a philosopher was a sin. And one important Christian was heard to say that the people should hunt down sinners and drive them into salvation, as a hunter drives its prey into traps. To think about God would surely not be a sin in God's eyes. Perhaps. And yet... here I am. And perhaps you have not told me all of your dream. I was betrayed, Forgemaster. I was hunted. I was tortured. I lied for my life... in a church, before a judge. I gave up others so that I may live. I became a sinner. And? And they killed me anyway. I woke up in Hell... because this world is insane. And... I learned something about sin. What did you learn? I learned... to like it. Yet here I am, back on the surface of the Earth... strong and free, in a world where thinking is considered something that should be tortured and murdered. Thank you for my second life. I intend to use it well and make wonderful new dreams of it. Frederator!
