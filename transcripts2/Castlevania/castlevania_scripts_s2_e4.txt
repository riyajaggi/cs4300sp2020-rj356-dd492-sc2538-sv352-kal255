 Ah, blood! I've dreamed of my legendary life, and now I am thirsty. Fuck your eyes, man, bring me blood and beer! [snorts] Oh, no, no. Th-That's not fair. Damn it all. That bloody woman is right. Something must be done. [Trevor] What the hell is this? - You don't know? - I don't know. This is your house. Do you know everything in your house? - I don't have a house. - [Alucard] She doesn't have a house. She's a Speaker. She's a nomad. It was rhetorical.

 - Rhetorical house that she doesn't have. - Just tell me what it is. - It was a magic mirror. - Also known as distance mirrors. Some of them even allow matter to pass through them, but... Hmm. No. No. This is a simple remote viewing mirror. A little of the activating language is chipped. A few of the runes need re-cutting, but workable. You have the most fascinating familyjunkyard, Belmont. You are a cockwart, Alucard. Stop it. You are an adult. You do not have to rise to his every barb. He's pissing me off like it's hisjob, Sypha. Grow up, Trevor. - Why is your name Trevor, anyway? - I'm sorry? I understand the Belmont now. But "Trevor" doesn't sound very local either. Oh. Well, so the story goes, a Celt rode out here with Leon back in the day, and his name was Trefor, with an F. Trefor. - [chuckles] I like that. - Oh, it's terrible. Treff. - Treffy. - Oh, my God, no. You are Treffy now. - Don't. - [both laughing] [wind howling] [Hector] ...but Dracula respects my skills. And the human world cast me out long ago. Why would I go against his wishes? [Carmilla] Dracula has failed his own people. He believes that he fell in love with a human woman. He took a pet. - You see that, don't you? - I believe he loved her. He is capable of love. That's the source of his conviction. If you love something, you act to keep it with you for as long as you can. Instead, he allowed her to be killed by other humans. He wasn't there. - [blows] - He wasn't, no. He was traveling, like a human, at herwhim. Not once did he move to protect her. Not once did he consider making her a vampire and bringing her into our community. You are loyal to Dracula and the night world, aren't you? You would have protected her. Of course I would have. [Carmilla] Of course you would. [Carmilla] But, on some level, he considers us less important than the brief life of a mistreated pet. Does that sound sane to you? It sounds... confused. And now he has taken us to war. Should this war be prosecuted by a confused man? L-I don't know. Has it occurred to you that you yourself, a loyal servant of the night world, a prized asset in our lives and wars, - are in fact next to die? - What? You're human, Hector. You threw in your lot with us because it was your path to greatness and joy. But your loyalty counts for nothing when a man who has decreed death to all humans, yet would not make his love a vampire, rampages across the face of the earth in mad fury. I ask you again, does that sound sane to you? He promised me that this would be a cull. That humans would be reduced in numbers and controlled. He is Dracula, Hector. Whywould he tell the truth to a human? Even you? [sighs] I just want to do my work, Carmilla. - I love my work. - I know you do. And I have a way of ensuring you will continue to do it. You just have to answer one question for me. And what's that? Are you prepared to abandon Dracula to win the war? You don't say something like that out loud in this place. What matters more? Wiping the earth of the humans you hate and submitting to your own death, or coddling a broken old man? The Castle must land at Braila, Hector. - Why? - Because I wish it. The Castle lands in Braila, by the river. Dracula's loyal forces will leave the castle to take the town. My own forces will take the castle and unseat Dracula. Saving your life. Going forward to control and surround the human race. [sighs] Dracula is powerful. Your forces alone may not be enough. You're right. Brilliant Hector. They may not be. Which is why you must do something for me. [footsteps approaching] [howls] [footsteps approaching] [lsaac] I heard you moving across the sand. That's very good, lsaac. Most people can't hear me moving at all. There's nothing out here but the sand. And even the wolves don't come close to my little home. - What brings you out here? - You. You have need of my work. Invite me across your threshold, lsaac. [Dracula] Do you remember how we first met, lsaac? [lsaac] That would be difficult to forget. [liquid pouring] Say the words. So I know you are still my friend. I was being hunted by brigand magicians who wanted to kill me, cut me up and sell my parts to other magicians. Someone like me is, in parts of the world, a rich supply of ingredients for potions, spells and even aphrodisiacs. - And you saved me. - I did. The only person in the world who ever lifted a hand to protect me from anything. And he was not a human. You are still my friend. I am. I do have need ofyourwork. The human race has betrayed me for one final time, and they must be punished. War, then? You need an army of the night? - You sound suspicious. - You're not human. Your passions are rare and pure. "War" sounds like a small thing, for you. It's the word you choose, but it's not what you mean. No. I mean to end the human race. - And you want my help to do it. - Yes. - Even though I'm a human being. - Yes. Do you remember my first words to you? Yes. Indulge me, Master Dracula. So that I may know you are still my friend. You said, "I have no fear of death. It always sounded peaceful to me." I will be loyal to the end. And beyond. Let us begin. [neighs] [high-pitched neigh] Drinking fucking pig blood? Fuck no! We are the generals of the court of Vlad Dracula Tepes, and we deserve a proper fucking drink! The maps say there's a town 20 miles away from here. They will never see us coming, and fuck them if they do. Tonight, we feed. [horse neighs] [exhales] [hammer clanging] Isaac. I feel like the tone of the war hall is turning against me. Even Hector looks at me as if he no longer knows me. I have respect for Hector. But he is a gentle soul. He's still a little boy. Probably the same little boy who didn't understand - why he was beaten for keeping pets. - [chuckles] Well, his pets were reanimated dead animals. One can understand any parent's discomfort with a dead cat doing a dance in the living room. [lsaac] He really only wants pets, you see? He really only understands pets. That's how he perceives yourwar. To cull humans back to a small population and then keep them in pens, he understands that. That is partly my fault. He's a child in a man's body. That does make him easy to lie to. You are Dracula. No one has a right to your true beliefs. - Not even you? - Not even me. You've given me purpose and treated me with respect. A lie wouldn't change that. You are unique. You don't owe anybody anything. You, lsaac, are the only one I've told the truth to. Because I believe you are the only one who grasps the necessity of it all. You rarely come to my working place. How can I be of service to you, Master Dracula? Are you still my friend? Always. Then know that you may be alone. [wind howling] [horses neighing] [laughs] [squelching] - [groaning] - [grunting] [woman screaming] [snarls] Are you okay? Tired. Sleep, then. A bit lonely. My dusty old sheet is big enough for two. And nobodywas ever lonely in this house. Thank you. Is Alucard asleep? He says he's slept enough. He's still poking around your family's things with a look of faint disgust. Heh. It's lonely even when you're standing next to him. It's strange. How so? I'm not sure. He's intelligent, sometimes even witty, in his way. And he's certainly half-human. More than half-human. He's a person in his own right. But it's like he's a cold spot in the room. - It's not like your sadness. - I'm not sad. Yes, you are. But I can shout at you, or tease you, and get a reaction that lets me know you're still in there. His sadness is like an icy well. It's bottomless... and it swallows up your voice and anything you try to drop into it. - Am I really sad? - All the time. You don't even notice it now. lt'sjust how you are. And then, sometimes... you'll tell me nobody's ever lonely in your house, - and offer me your stinky blanket. - [chuckles] In all honesty, that stink might not be my blanket. [Sypha snores softly] I wish you would stop doing that. It's sick. The body is sick. it must be purged. It must be focused. This is holy work. How did Dracula draft you into his service, I wonder? I make purity from human corruption. Human corruption is a stain on the world. It was a simple choice. Well, talking about choices. Carmilla is making a lot of sense to me. - In what way? - There's no plan. Dracula doesn't act on our recommendations. He barely listens to you and Hector. We're just thrashing around the country randomly. There is an intent. We don't need strict battle plans. We simply follow his intent. We didn't need to hit Gresit right away, you know. And we should have been made aware that Alucard was under the bloody city. Alucard is nothing. A spoiled child. Alucard knows almost as much as Dracula himself, and is almost as strong. And, it turns out, violently opposed to the war because his human mother wouldn't have wanted it or some shit. I'm saying, it may be time for the old man to sit in his study and let the rest of us take care of this for him. Do it right. Set up livestock pens and pursue the war properly. Without him. You would betray Dracula? It's not betrayal. Unless the old man decides to be difficult about it. I see. [groans] - [lsaac grunts] - [Godbrand groans] [Godbrand chokes] [Godbrand grunts] [Godbrand groans] Thank you for revealing to me how the corruption of the world has made its way into Dracula's court. Thank you for showing me the truth. [Godbrand screams] [grunts] [muffled screaming] [voice] Frederator!
