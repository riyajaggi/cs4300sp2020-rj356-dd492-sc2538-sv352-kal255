 Previously, on "The Real Housewives of Dallas" I love my work. I just don't wanna do it all the time. No one's forcing you to work full-time. Kary and I had a knock-down drag-out at Brandi's birthday. You're always dramatic every single time I... ing - talk to you. - And you're not dramatic? No, I'm not. You clearly have no ...ing clue. I do have a clue, I know... Okay, stop!

 Now that everyone is here, I shall make an announcement. No fighting. I know that's really hard in this group. Okay. You just ate some crickets. No, I didn't. Hey, Brandi? Ew, gross. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, Brandi. No, girl, you're good. You're good. I wasn't trying to make you puke. I still kind of feel like unsure of myself when I'm around Tiffany.

 Okay, Kary, this is your riddle and you have to guess what we're doing to further celebrate your birthday. Okay. Water, that's a lake, Austin. We're riding rock star style on a tour bus. I don't need your approval, I need you to get out of my way If you take a shot at me, it better be tequila. I can save your life but not your reputation. Take it from me, a sinner is just a saint who keeps on trying. Dallas girls are sugar and spice but I'm still working on nice. I love to be pampered but I'm nobody's pet. So, on the trip... You're in Austin. So Austin, the first day we're having like a little country situation where we're having barbeque and Western Day, and there's a person that does chicken sh... bingo that's coming. That's got to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. No, it's gonna be awesome. Packing already, huh? We're staying in a house. So why are you packing my underwear? I have a blow-up doll that kind of looks like you. Like me? But he needs these because he's very well-endowed. Okay. We're staying at this estate and it is right on Lake Austin. This all is going. What's already in the suitcases? Well, half this suitcase is my shoes. Do you know how big these feet are? I got big feet. Do you know how big my shoes are? It takes up half my suitcase. Yeah, but how many shoes are you bringing? I have a different shoe for every outfit. Kam, that's ridiculous. - Hi, girl. - Hi. Oh, my God, your hat. I'm like Kameron may steal it from me. Oh, I am gonna steal it. You better lock it up. Okay. So I'm bringing, like, cover ups, bathing suits. Like, what are we gonna do, like, at night? We're probably just gonna do like a fun Texas-themed dinner. Okay. I'm glad I called you because I was not packing any cowboy stuff, okay? Have like a really fabulous outfit to wear going to Austin because we have to be like rock stars, you know, we're gonna be on a tour bus. Okay. Like, seriously? We're all rock stars. So Stephanie and I decided that a rock star tour bus was gonna be the perfect transportation to Austin. I was thinking I was gonna wear like jean shorts on the way there. Yes, that's perfect. These ladies better pull out their rock star outfits because we are gonna be rocking it in this bus rock star style. Okay, Kam, well, I'm so excited - and I'll see you soon. - Okay. I'm so excited, girl. - Okay. Bye! - Okay. Bye. I need my girl time like I need air to breathe. I'll wear boots with my Daisy Dukes. Okay. Is this the one you're wanting? Yes. Okay. Let's do this one first. Look, it's ombre. It's aluminum, it's Dior. - Very cool. - Cool, right? - Mm-hmm. - Like, I'm really excited to go on this trip, but right when I get back is when I have my meeting. - Mm-hmm. That's right. - And I feel like I need to go into that meeting with... Like, in a good headspace. - Right. - Why am I still wearing this stupid hat? I set up an appointment with my supervisor where I'm going to ask him for a reduction in my work hours and it is giving me so much anxiety. I'm going into it feeling good but still, like, scared. - So I'll need you to... - It'll be good. To give me, like, a really good pep talk. - Okay. - I wanna spend more time with my kids but I'm worried that it will hurt my career which I've worked my entire life for. I have a bunch of outfits that are like, "This one or this one. This one or this one." So I think I'm gonna call D'Andra. Okay. Let me know if you need something. - Hi. - Hi. I'm a hot mess if you can see my hair. I'm trying on all these clothes I mean... That's what I'm doing right now. - Okay. Look... - Wash and wear is not my favorite thing... I made an Excel spreadsheet because that's how I do life is through spreadsheets. You're doing a lot better than me. You covered all the bases. Spreadsheets is my love language. You can calculate things. It prints all on one page. Does everyone not do this? I need to consult to you on several items. - Are you ready? - Okay. Are these rocker chic? Oh, my God, you're gonna fall all over yourself in the bus. - Those are cute. - Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Is that chic? I think I saw a lot of these in Vietnam. I wanted one so bad. Okay. I bought you one. Oh, great. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, but it's kind of not nice that I didn't get them for everyone else, like, that just now occurred to me. Why am I always thinking that they're gonna think the worst of me? Well, I mean, that's what I wanted talk to yo about, like, how do you think Friday went? - Well... - Because... Well, how do you think Friday went, since you were my guest? Some of the girls, you know, were telling me they were really put off because they were uncomfortable and because they didn't feel welcome, they didn't feel like you were a good hostess, they didn't wanna come back. But like what part of me was not a good hostess? Pizza night at Tiffany's was a horrible experience. How is pizza not a good experience? She says that there are rules. If anyone does something inappropriate or wrong, you will be put on timeout. I went to her pizza party. What did she put on your pizza? Crickets and grasshoppers. - Oh, my God, I'd be so mad. - Yeah, I could've died. Stephanie and I both have Toto toilets also. We don't sit there and talk about them. I did not think that talking about my toilets was bragging. I mean, I thought I was just stating a fact. This house has nine toilets. - Yeah. - Nine toilets? I'm glad that you're telling me because I had no clue. You know, I was gonna tell you. When we got on the trip, I was gonna have a talk with yo but I thought it was better to do it now before you get on the bus tomorrow in case something is said. And then they attack me. I just feel like everything I do is wrong. I've never had a huge group of girlfriends that all hung out together. The number one priority was always school. I just wanna have some fun and I really wanna, like, get to know the other women better, - you know. - I'm gonna go in there like you, have a good time, try not to fight off the bat. I always aspire to be one of the cool girls because I was always on the sidelines, like, watching them. So this is my chance to be part of the girl gang. It's just not going that well so far. I'm gonna meditate every morning so that one... Can you teach me how to meditate, too? Because I'm trying and I usually just fall asleep or thinking about my to-do list. Seriously. This is a neon cowboy hat, okay? You got a mammoth forehead in there. Put it on. Put it on and look in the mirror. My head's little. Look at you fore... So tomorrow when we go on the tour bus, you know, we are supposed to dress like rock and roll, like it's rock and roll tour bus. You got a lot of those old rock and roll shirts. It would be amazing. Well, that, I had gotten a new one. It's literally been sitting there for a few minutes. I think it's perfect. - I love it. - So then... Is it rock and roll all weekend? No, it's just going there. But then tomorrow night is a cowboy theme, - which, you know... - Meh. I don't do the Daisy Duke situation. So, how are you feeling for kind of going through your spiritualness? Obviously Kary's really mad at me, and I don't know that I've done anything but she hasn't come to me. Look, you guys are gonna have loads of time on the trip to figure that all out. At some point I'm sure we'll talk. Darrin told me when I talked to her just to say I've been thinking about you and... Because I have been thinking about her, I've been praying for her daughter. I know you have. I don't like to be fighting with Kary. I don't like this distance. It's upsetting to me because we've had such a great friendship and hopefully we will rekindle that friendship that I miss and that fun that I miss, and the reason that we were such good girlfriends. And all you can do is extend the olive branch. Whether they wanna take the olive branch or not, that's on them. But I absolutely... I'll do the best I can, but you know how when you push me so far, I snap. Well, this isn't the time to snap, all right? I'll do the best I can. You'll kick ass at it. Coming up... Y'all have a good... ing night. D'Andra. You said you wanted... And you go yourself. Hey, D'Andra. D. - Good lord. - Good. All right, make good choices. Let's go see what the bus looks like. Hello. So cool. - There are beds back there. - Wow. Let's go look. Look how cool this is, Hilton. - Yay. - Just look at the front. I don't usually do buses because I get really motion sickness. Oh, my God. No, it's so cool. But this is another level and I've always wanted to ride on a rock star bus, okay? I never was a groupie, okay? So this is my chance. - Love you. - Kiss. Love you. - Hello. - Hi. You look so amazing. - It's like Elvis sexy. - Yeah. Girl, you look so good in that. This outfit was actually from my cheer days. We would wear this outfit to the airport so nobody would know we were Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. Gotta get my friend. Oh, it's a boy. What on earth? - Ew. - Hi. Yes, who is that? Is that Eduardo or... No, this is Captain Dick. Oh, my God he has a wiener. No, that is too much. Captain Dick is inspired by Captain Brandi. What is that? This is Captain Brandi. I mean, he's a redhead, so he kind of looks a little bit like Bryan. This is a new prop for me. - Hey, guys. - Hey, girls. I have some helpers with me. Oh, my goodness, look at your rocker outfit. I know, mask kiss. - Oh, there's Brandi. - Oh. - Hi. - Hi. Who do you got there? Thank goodness the girls are hanging out... - What's your name? - Captain Dick. It's very nice to make your acquaintance, sir. Go in the car before my children asks who this is. We're gonna steal your mommy for a few days. For a few days. - Hi. - What is that? The hair and makeup team is here. Oh, my gosh. Are you... Oh, my, that's amazing. D'Andra usually has one more bag than I do because she, like, brings her personal pharmacy and the bag is filled with all her pills. - Oh, my gosh. - Okay. I love that. That looks so cute. It's not like it's shoes, it's pills. - Okay. I'm gonna... - Okay. D'Andra, I want one for the next trip. I have a fear of not having enough stuff. Wait, is that all she brought? - No, are you kidding me? - Oh. My mother would go through my room every day when I'd go to school and throw out what she thought I didn't need. So I wanna have options because I didn't have options growing up. Guess who's here. Yay, birthday girl. - Happy birthday. - Thank so much. - Oh, my God, that top. - So cute. Hi. - Oh, my God. - Well, you look fabulous. - Love you, Mom. - Love you. Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - Mwah. We need to make sure he doesn't have any coronavirus right here. I put a lot of thought and effort into making Captain Brandi. But all you do with Captain Dick is you blow him up, that's it. STDs. Oh, yeah. It's crazy. Okay, guys, this is our fabulous bus driver. - Hi. - Hi. And I just wanted to warn you, this group is a little rowdy. Okay. I'll make sure it stays on the DL. - Let's get this party started. - Oh, my God. Okay. Where are we all sitting? - Austin! - Here we go. - Okay. Who's excited? - I am so excited. Okay. Here we go, guys. Austin. Let's get this party started. Who's ready to party like it's 1999? You guys, this is gonna be the best trip ever. Stephanie and I have planned so many fun things up our sleeves. A lot of surprises are coming. First off, I would like to pass out our itineraries. Of course, they're pink. And I also just wanna let you all know that they are signature scented, okay? - What is that perfume? - Oh, it's Chanel. And for those of you at home, go ahead and spray your Chanel now and you'll be able to follow along on what we're smelling. Open it up. Oh, it's so good. I'm not gonna get you. Little bit. Hurry. I love you, but I don't like this game. - Just the tip. - Just the tip. Just the tip. Given that the pizza party was such a disaster, this is a brand new and improved Tiffany. This Tiffany does not have rules, wants to say yes when people ask her if she wants to do activities that may be outside of her comfort zone. I just did the tip. I just did the tip. And basically just wants to have fun and bond with the other women. Oh, my God! - That was him. - Oh. This is insane. I spent many time on a tour bus. D'Andra! You little ho. This is what I wanna talk about. - I got nothing. - I was a total groupie. I mean in the '80s and '90s, anyone that played in a band was the coolest guy ever. If they had an instrument in their hand, they were, like, probably gonna get laid. Yes, D'Andra. So I went out with John Entwistle from The Who right before he died. I don't know who that is. I don't know who that is either. He was the bass guitarist for The Who. Oh, my God. I was on Chris Cornell's tour bus. I got nothing. The guys from Candlebox. I've known none of the people she's named. The guys from The Cult. And then the rest of them I just don't remember because I was so... ed up. Okay, sexy time. What is your favorite sexual position? Hmm. I like doggie style. Oh. I just like being pounded from behind. I always have. I just like it. So she can read her messages at the same time. Well. Okay. So he grabs my leg or he's up here, here, and I'm like, whoo! - You must be very flexible. - Oh. Yes. I'm not that flexible with men. When I'm in bed and it feels good... I become a gymnast. I like side because... I call it side to side. I like reverse cowboy especially right now because I don't have to smell his breath. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my gosh. Okay. What is the craziest place you've ever done it? Wait, you didn't answer the question. I've been trying to change the subject. I know. I bet you like it in the shower so you stay clean. I would say legs up. I've got some long legs, so. - That's a lot of leg. - Oh, yeah. I like that. When the legs are up, that's good, yes. Yes. Are we here? This is gonna be amazing. We are here, guys. I can't get the bus down here. This is not gonna make it going over that grass. It's not gonna make it. It's not designed to go on this type of street. - Can you not get the bus down? - No, that's too tight. - It's too tight? - Yeah. Gosh. Where is the golf cart? How long is the walk? Oh, my God. Let's walk down the driveway, and then the manager's gonna get our bags. - It'll be worth it. - So where are the butlers? So let me get this straight. We are rock stars and I'm wearing my 12-inch heels and this bus is not gonna be able to go down this hill? Like, are you kidding me? Can somebody grab a tequila? Oh, my God. What kind of... ing hostess sh... is this? I no longer wanna be a rock star. Coming up... I hate it when my friends fight. It's like when I was a little girl and I used to watch my parents fight. This is the worst hotel ever. Oh, my gosh. We have no butlers. - I don't even see a house. - Jesus, help me. Lord God, I thought I exercise. Not enough, apparently. Yeah. My leather is, like, wet and stuck to my butt. Is somebody gonna come and carry me? This wasn't part of the itinerary. Who's gonna make it to the house? Survival of the fittest. Who's getting eaten by the wolves? Oh, my God. My feet are bleeding. Okay. We're almost there, ladies. Keep it up. Look at this place. Oh, my gosh. - Look, there's a playground. - This is amazing. - This is beautiful. - Wow. Kameron and I planned this trip seamlessly. We are staying at this beautiful estate called The Echelon. And it has a lake in the back, Lake Austin. Tons of land. And it's kind of like Kary... We have a little bit of classy, a little bit of nasty, all planned into a wonderful weekend. - Ladies. - Hi. Welcome to The Echelon. Come on in. - Thank you so much. - This is amazing. I know you had to take a walk down the hill. - Oh, it looks so pretty. - Yeah. Kary, let's go. - Let's go get a... ing drink. - I'm sweating. I'm gonna get naked in front of y'all, just you know. - Oh, my God. - Oh. Lord God. - You guys, let's get naked. - We have arrived. - Kary, how amazing is this? - This is so amazing. Mclean is right outside with your drinks to rescue you. - Oh, perfect. - Hey, did you see the pool - over there? - Look at the indoor pool. - Okay. This is beautiful. - Insane. Kary, look at the dock over there. We can have a cocktail out there. - Oh, my gosh. - It's so cool. - Okay. Where is my room? - Birthday girl needs - the master bedroom. - Absolutely. Come with me. - Yes. - Okay. I could jump in the lake or the pool or something. - We'll go right upstairs here. - Show us. Up here, we've got the master's right this way. - Oh, that's precious. - Look at this. - Okay. I love it. - Okay. Girl, this is the best birthday room. - We can do TikToks here. - Whoo. Oh, this is nice. It's like a whole suite. This is great. Oh, we even have our own balcony. This is so romantic. This is how me and Daniel shower. Like that. And then Daniel is going like... I just wanna take these heels off because, you know, I didn't think I'd be walking a mile. - Girl, I'm so hot, I'm dying. - Oh. - I wanna go to the lake. - Yeah. - Come on. Come on. - I love this grass. - I want this grass at home. - I know, right? Hi. Can you come pick us up? I wanna do a toast. First, I wanna say, obviously, thank you. I really appreciate all of you being here. I'm really enjoying to get to know you more, Tiffany. You know, I never wanna come off like a bully. You know, I know you said that about me a little bit. I'm, like. All about helping people getting... - Yes. - ...let loose. Yes. There is a difference between helping someone and like pushing them into the pool. Yeah. And I'm so sorry if you think like I've been like that. Like, if I love you and I want you to have a good time with me, that's me. That's my personality. So if you're at all, like, ever offended by me, come talk to me. I will change. And I'm very sorry if I ever offended you. - Oh, my gosh, girl, no, no. - So... okay. I just wanna have so much fun this weekend. - Ladies, act like we're 21. - Yes. - Yes. Yes. - And have fun and... - Cheers, bitches. - Cheers. - Turn it up. - Yeah. - Yes. - Yes. This is the Kary I love. Like, Kary is quick to own up to her mistakes whenever she makes them and remedy things. That was the sweetest thing she's ever done. She truly is a really good friend. Oh, happy birthday, mamacita. - Oh, excited to be here. - I love you. Hey, shall we get ready for dinner? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Salud. - Salud. We will see you soon. - I'm gonna get ready. - I'm going to our room. There's so many great areas to, like, hang out in. What we're doing, this is called turndown service. - Are you listening? - Yeah, I'm listening. - I'm just a little upset. - Why are you upset? You know, Kary had this, like, very flowery speech for everybody about "I want us to all have a good time. "It's all love and flowers and unicorns... - Maybe she actually means it. - "...coming out of my ass, "but yet, you know, I was really mean to my really good friend." Props to Kary for giving Tiffany an apology speech. But the fact that she's doing somersaults to apologize to Tiffany yet there is a huge wedge in our friendship is a little odd to me. What's over there? Oh, that's where Tiffany and D'Andra are staying. Let's go see if their bags came. I was gonna say something but I was like... - Maybe she actually meant it. - Yeah. Like... it's like you can't just wipe away - like two weeks... - Hey. - No. - They come? No, not yet. Okay. Did the bell boy bring your bags? - Not yet. Uh-uh. - Isn't this beautiful? - It's gorgeous. - Gorgeous. We are sleeping together on a suite. I don't understand how you're gonna sleep in this bed together. Girl, look. - You guys are... yeah. But... - Wait. There's so much space. - This bed is super comfy. - Dude, we're gonna go change. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Okay. D'Andra. All I'm saying is the nice pretty speech on the dock, I wasn't buying. But at the same time, it's just... - it's gross. - Just try, D'Andra. Like, maybe she's turning over a new leaf. Like, give her the benefit of the doubt. I said nothing. I said nothing. I kept my mouth shut. Normally I'd be like, "Bully!" Coming up... - Hurry up. I'm hungry. - That's it. Well, you'll never know how long it's gonna take. Oh, I have two sh... s. Sh..., sh..., sh...! I said nothing. Nothing. I kept my mouth shut. Normally I'd be like, "Bully." - Do you? - ...what happened with us. Maybe it's all just water under the bridge. - Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. - No? ...speech just now, like, sort of came from her heart and she really just wants us to have a good time. That's not okay, because then we're just lying to each other. - That's not friendship. - Yeah. No, I'm not saying pretend like it... it never happened and you guys didn't say some really hurtful things - to each other. - We did. I don't put up with sh... From people. You know, I was really hoping that we could work out our problems, but that just hurts me to the core. I'm shocked. I'm just trying to be a more sensitive, - compassionate, loving person. - You are. - And you are. - But at the same time, there's boundaries. And you try to poke and prod, that's something that I'm not okay with. - I'm gonna... ing bite. - Over what? Like, nothing even happened yet. But I just wanted to tell you what happened. Like, if you want to paint a picture that you're upset, then you're gonna be upset. It just didn't resonate with me, that's all I'm saying. When D'Andra gets upset, she's like a dog that chases its own tail. There's a problem. Like, you cannot get a word in when she's doing this. You know, you wanna have a good time, but guess what? I'm still... ing pissed at her. That's okay. Whatever the... ing problem is, I don't know. And I just wanna be like, stop. Oh, let's, just for one second like, maybe give her the benefit of the doubt. D'Andra talks a lot of sh... And I normally just don't take it that personal. - Stephanie? - Can we come in? Okay. Listen, we have to talk to you. But hearing D'Andra call me a bully and saying all those things behind my back, this is really hurtful. This is just something that you don't do to a friend. Put a robe on. I literally wanna cry. - D'Andra... - Wait. Why do you wanna cry? - What happened? - I wanna have a good time. - Yeah. - I wanted to start the trip off right. So I did it... The speech, you know. Then me and Kameron are walking back, D'Andra... Talking a lot of trash about Kary. She was just basically saying Kary's a bully, such a bad person. Like it just went on and on and on. And tonight, like, yeah, like, on the bus, on the bus, on and on. Talking sh... about me the whole time. Tiffany was trying to get her out of this cycle. Tiffany was actually defending me. Like, "D'Andra, I don't even know why you're saying this." - ...stay out of the cycle. - Kary was nice. - Yeah. - Like, "She apologized. She was that." And D'Andra was like, "I think it was fake. I thought"... yes. Maybe she's jealous. Maybe she's jealous that you're wanting to start fresh with Tiffany and... Yeah. I mean... and I'm like, literally, like, here, like, trying to have a good birthday trip and everything else and she said that. I thought that was very brave of you... - Yes. - ...because you... You're putting yourself out there. ...you were putting yourself out there and you were... you're apologizing for who you are, you know. Yeah. She misinterpreted you. - Girl, don't be sad. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We love you. - I love you. - Okay. Group hug. You're not wrong, she is. I do know that Kary and D'Andra love each other, but they're also two of the most headstrong people I've ever met in my life. I don't know why she's being like that. The fact that Kary is so passionate about D'Andra being a better friend means she's wanting a closer relationship and loves her. Honestly, what I would do if I was in the same situation, I would just say I heard a lot of things tonight. - Mm-hmm. - And they're very disappointing. I thought we were better friends than that. - And... - Yeah. - That's how I would do it. - Oh, you all really think - I should say that? - Yeah. I wanna eat. - Tiffany? - Yes, dear? - How can I help you? - I need my B12 shot. - It's been over 10 days. - B12 shot equals Party D'Andra. Is right here okay? Oh, my God. Okay. That was very unprofessional. - It's gonna hurt. - You ready? - Yep. - It's gonna be "eh." - Ow! - You're fine. That was a small needle and a big booty. Where's your Band Aid? Look. Look. Bitch. Bitch. It's not even bleeding. Like, you're done. I'm gonna start getting ready. This is gonna be for Western Night. - Those are so... - Aren't these so fun? ...freaking cute. I'm ready to eat some dinner. Ready. - It's like a little sparkle. - Oh, no. I love it. You like it? Yeah, you look like Miss Texas. Remember when we went to Beaver Creek, to Kam's place, - I got those boots... - Yeah, are those the boots - that you bought. - Yes. And so... Okay. Whenever you and D'Andra went shopping. I didn't know about the... Either way, they were like $2,500. So I'm gonna get some use out of them. Oh, girl. You better get some use out of those. What do you want, Kam? The... I want a Skinny Sweet plus plus. - You want a little grapefruit? - Oh, man. Court just said the kids are asleep. I was gonna call them before bed. - Hola. - Hola. - Como estas? - Oh. Hey. Hey. Jeez, girl. That's a lot of tequila. Oh, no, that's not... Part of me just wants to tell D'Andra to leave. I just wanna have fun, I wanna be with my girls but I am just in shock and disappointed. And I don't know if I'm gonna be able to sit in a table with her tonight. I am done being nice with her. Coming up... Nitpicking all the... ing time. Tit for tat. Let me poke, poke, poke, poke, okay? Sit the down and take a... ing breath. Kameron. What is our sitting arrangement? Birthday girl, you gotta do this. Okay. So I'll sit here. Kameron and Stephanie next to me because they're the party hosts. - Okay. - Okay. So I have a very special surprise for you guys. We are going to play a really fun game called Chicken Sh... Bingo. It's gonna be awesome. So we're gonna go over here. - The lady has a chicken. - Yes. There's a board. Let's go play this Chicken Sh... Bingo. - I'm so excited. - I'm ready. All you have to do is just try to have the chicken - sh... on our number. - On our number? - Hi, ladies. How are you? - Hi. This is definitely special. Oh, I need my drink for this. Who do you think came up with Chicken Sh... Bingo? Stephanie. She's so gross. So gross. So do any of y'all know anything about Chicken Sh... Bingo at all? - No. - No. So I'm gonna hand each a set of tickets. If the chicken poops on the board correlated to the ticket you have in your possession, then you're gonna be a chicken sh... winner. This whole Chicken Sh... Bingo thing is the reason why people make fun of Texans and call us hillbillies. Y'all ready for me to put the chicken on? - Yes. - Yes. We are ready. All right. So I'm gonna put Patsy Cline on. Look at my numbers, Patsy Cline. I got 1, 10, 20, 4, 24, 35. All right, Patsy. Look at the... - Okay, girl. - No conspiring. You better get my number. Winner winner, chicken dinner. - Patsy. - Come on, Patsy. Well, you never know how long it's gonna take. - Oh, my goodness. - Patsy Cline. - Patsy. - Hurry up, I'm hungry. She's on 41. Who has 41? I have a 40, but not 41. I've never wanted a chicken to poop so much in my life. Oh, I have two sh... s. Sh..., sh..., sh...! Oh, my gosh. You got a lot of worms, Patsy. She's probably nervous. She probably needs some tequila. Yes. Drink some tequila. It seems unsanitary to play with chickens and their poop. This is the weirdest game I've ever played. Oh, wait, wait. - Number one. - One. Oh, my God. I win a lot of sh... That was a new experience for me. - Hi, ladies. - It's over. We're about to start dinner service and you can just bring your plate to the buffet just to keep it a little more COVID-friendly. - Yay. - Awesome. Thank you. - Thanks, Elizabeth. - Can't wait. Can I do a toast right now? - Yes, mama. - To everybody. I feel like I just have to do this toast because it's really important to me because honestly I only want to be surrounded by love. True friends, by people that wanna be here, you know? And if you don't like me and if you don't wanna be here, if you're upset with me, don't be here. D'Andra, if you're upset with me and you don't wanna be here and you wanna talk behind my back, you know, don't come. I was invited here, Kary. So if you don't want me here, I'm happy to go home. I've always been a thousand percent honest with you, and you, and you, and you, and you. Like, always, you know? I don't talk behind people's back. You sometimes are very bullying to me. Very what? Bullying to me. - Bullying? - Bullying. - I bully you? - Yeah. Yes. - What? - Bullying. I have a really big problem with that word. Like, I don't think you should throw it around. I do, too. I have a really big problem with that word, too. I don't think it's fair at all that you throw that word around. Okay. Let me ask everybody on this table. Have you guys ever seen me bully D'Andra? You know, I think you guys yell at each other. I don't think you bully her. Yeah, I don't know if you know the definition. D'Andra, I've never ever bullied you. Ever. Okay? I choose my words very carefully. And I definitely know the definition of bullying. And even though you chicken sh... s are afraid to say it, I will. It started with the trunk shows and how I packed the car. - Then it was the COVID scare. - Oh, wait. - I don't have coronavirus. - Oh, wait, are you here? Every other week, she's like, "I'm so sick, I'm dying." And then the next day she looks beautiful and... Then Grapevine. There's only a little bit of ice here. That tequila's... ing warm. "She's a... ing doctor, she's..." She's... you're giving her a hard time. I mean, I'm not giving you a... ing hard time, you bitch. And even without those instances, this right here is bullying. I'm calling you now a bully. Not... ing last week, bitch. I'm calling you now a bully, okay? Why are you calling me a bully? Because you're so ...ing nitpicking all the... ing time. Tit for tat. Let me poke, poke, poke, poke, okay? Sit the down and take a... ing breath for God's sake. So who's being a bully right now? - Not me because you started it. - You know what? Me and Kameron sat outside your room when you were talking to Tiffany and said all this sh... about me. Friendships should be communicating and growing and figuring it out and, D'Andra, - you know, with you... - You're so full of sh... Right now I can't listen to it because you sat there and gave a big flowery speech but you have not made an effort to talk to me? Of course I'm feeling like, "You know what? This is a bunch of bullsh..." Me and Kameron heard what you were saying about me and you know what? It really hurt me. Stephanie, you don't think... - You know what she said to me? - She was... she was crying, yeah. - Do you think I wasn't hurt? - Yeah, she was crying, D'Andra. Well, the horrible things that you've said about me, - I'm sorry... - You said to me, "Kary, you have nothing to worry about because you kids are grown." You have three kids that are grown. Once child that's 12 that is home under your care. The rest of them do whatever they wanna do. You know what? You clearly have no... ing clue. - I do have a clue. - No, you don't. You know how that felt? You have no idea what I'm going through with my kids. How the am I supposed to know you're having problems if you don't tell me you're having problems? I wear my heart on my sleeve. I say, "You know, Kary, I've had a sh... y day. My business isn't doing great, my husband and I had a fight. You know, how's it going in your world?" "Oh, everything's fine." Well, if everything's ...ing fine... But do you ask her questions about her family? - Yes. Yes, I do. - No, she doesn't. - Yes, I do. - That's a... ing lie. - So that's a lie. - That's a lie. - That's a lie. That's a lie. - That's a lie. That's a lie. That's a lie. D'Andra is like on D'Andra's world and she thinks maybe one time that we're on the phone, and it's like, "Hey, how are you doing?" "Okay. So how... how's your family? How are your kids?" "Okay. Good. Moving on." D'Andra's missing the connection between being genuine friend and checking the box. If you don't wanna be here for my birthday because of what me and Kameron heard you saying behind my back, why are you here? Well, maybe I should go home. Maybe I shouldn't be here. Maybe you should. Yeah, that's fine. All I'm saying is if you don't wanna be here, D'Andra, don't be here because I... Everybody wants to be here. I came here because I wanna be here, I'm here... If you want me to go home, I'm happy to go home. If you're gonna be a mean girl and you just wanna talk... So do you want me to go home? I don't want you to be here if you wanna be a mean girl. Okay. Then I can go. I'm happy to go. No, no, no, no. I don't need to be here. I don't need to be here. D'Andra, you guys have been friends for a long time. - I agreed to be here. - No, but sit down, because whenever we talked at your house... Y'all have a good... ing night. D'Andra, you said you wanted to... And you go yourself. Hey. D'Andra. D. - D'Andra. - Really? We're not gonna do this. - D'Andra. - And you go yourself. Hey. D'Andra. D. - D'Andra. - Really? We're not gonna do this. Let's go get our little food. You're not gonna go home. This is stupid. Hey, D'Andra. I don't need your sh... I don't need to do this. D'Andra. It just is an easy conversation. Just tell her. You know what? I've had the easy conversation. I'm done with the easy ...ing conversation. I'm done with this sh... I'm trying to figure out - how I can get home right now. - D'Andra, you don't wanna go home. Like, you guys have been friends - for a long time. - Please eat dinner. This is like... you guys... No, I'm not going back out there being treated like that. - There's... ing no way. - D'Andra, you're being... Not... I don't need to go back out there. You guys sat there and like, "Oh, that's not bullying." You guys are... ing full of sh..., too. - I do not think she's a bully. - No, D'Andra. Nor do I think you are. I think you're both combative. I'm not gonna call anybody a bully - that I don't think is a bully. - Y'all are fighting. I'm going home. I don't need to do this sh... - Don't do it like this. - I'm out of here. You're not gonna leave. First of all, it's gonna take you five years to pack your suitcases. - No, I won't. It's fine. - It's not worth it. First of all, please don't leave me alone. - Like, slumber parties... - You'll be fine. Y'all are the bestie... Best friends. What? I really don't care, to be honest. D'Andra, she loves you. I just... Well, then she shouldn't be talking to me like that. And her and Kameron were like two... ing bulldogs at a chicken fight. You know, I'm like, done with this sh..., okay? She doesn't come to apologize to me for last week and now she's on my ass about this week? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I came on this trip so she needs to extend the olive branch now. Otherwise, I'm going home. That's the way I feel. Not happening. Kary is a great friend of mine, and I will say she doesn't know how to come in in a soft manner. She comes in like guns blazing, telling you how she thinks. But as aggressive as she is with D'Andra, I know it's because she loves her and she wants to build a relationship with her. Kary, will you just go talk to her, please? Like, we're just spinning in circles. Listen, Tiffany. I'm not gonna be like the fake person that she is because I'm not fake. Well, she wasn't being fake. She was just, like, saving it. Oh, well, it's... guess what? It's... we're not on D'Andra's time. I'm gonna tell you one thing right now. Kary keeps saying, "I'm not a bully, I'm not a bully." But I'm looking at her and I'm thinking, "You kinda look like one right now." Can you listen to me for a minute? I'm gonna come home. Because Kary, like... ing lit into me within the first dinner and I'm, like, not gonna put up with this sh... at all. - Here, I'm coming in here. - I'm listening. Everything was fine. We all went out to, like, the grass and had like a drink and she's like, you know, "I want you all to be here, "rainbows and sunshine and... ing unicorns coming out of my ass and I love everybody." And I'm like, "This is not how you feel because you and I have not talked in a week." So, I came back into my room with Tiffany and I'm like, "You know, that's bullsh..." Kameron and Kary were apparently sitting outside my bedroom listening to the conversation I had with Tiffany. You know... Right. They were spying. You know, I'm kinda like done, honestly. I'm done. I just hate to see you guys, like... she's really hurting. No, but you know what? I'm hurting more and I already cried. - This is not a hurt-off. - It's not a competition. You guys are both hurting. You guys are both hurting. It's not a... she's really hurting and she has a lot of sh... - Right now. - Well, why are you crying? Because I hate it when my friends fight. It's like when I was a little girl and I used to watch my parents fight. This fight is not even involving you right now. - Are you kidding me? - I mean... I'm sort of like upset at you two, but I'm sort of also crying for myself because I'm like, this is not fun. Girl, you've never hung out with girls like us, then. I came to have a good time. Please go talk to her. - Okay, you have no... - But she needs to take... You don't... ing know me. You can cry all... ing day, I will not... ing take a step with her because she owes it to me. - She needs to take one step. - Okay? She's been a bad friend and I will never take a step for her right now over my dead... ing body. Just watch me. You've never seen the most stubborn... ing bitch in your life. So don't... ing come crying to me about anything and ask me to beg to talk to D'Andra because I will... ing never do it. I'm gonna go get another drink. I have friends that treat me with respect. - I don't need this sh... - Right. Later this season on "The Real Housewives of Dallas" - We're finally on the way. - Cheers. Yeah. Slow and steady always wins the race, ladies. I did not know that giraffes could hula hoop. Vacation, D'Andra will come out whenever Kary and D'Andra have a talk. - That's what I think. - I don't know. I literally just sh... myself. You think I'm an opportunistic person that does things for personal gain? You're darn right I do. Brandi, you're acting like a cafeteria Christian. You can pick the blue Jell-O... That's bullsh..., D'Andra. We're doing a shot. Oh, my gosh. - Brandi's dead. - Who killed you? I don't know. I'm dead.
