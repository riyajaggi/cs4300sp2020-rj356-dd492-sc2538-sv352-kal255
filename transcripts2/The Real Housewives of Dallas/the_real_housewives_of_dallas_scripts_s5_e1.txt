When the pandemic started, we explained to the children that there was a disease that was from a bat, and someone ate a bat. - I'm not eating peanut butter - and jelly sandwiches again. No. Not from this lady over here. - They were very concerned - that someone Was out there eating bats. - But I said to them, - there's a lot of people That like very unique foods. Oh, peanut butter is so good. Hmm. - Mom. - What? - No, I'm making an Oreo sandwich, are you silly? - What scares me the most about coronavirus is the unknown. People could turn into zombies, and you... we don't know. I mean, we must have been really bad to deserve a year like this. God is not happy with us. There's not very much jelly. - Yeah. Like, we should put more Oreo. - Okay. Are you excited for Fanci coming home? - Dad. - I am so excited, You guys miss Fanci? - You think she's gonna - come home potty trained? - I mean, she wasn't when she left. - Towards the end of last year, Louis passed away, and I was devastated. I waited six months until I was able to even think of another dog. - I just think you spend - all this money, - And they're gonna come in, - and like ruin the, - The training, - you're gonna spoil it. - But if he gives rules like - don't wear the dog in a purse, Are you gonna put the dog in a purse all day or... - Why, you can put - a dog in a purse, Probably not gonna be bad. Louis passed away about eight months ago. But here's what you don't know. I was in New York for New York Fashion Week, and I get a call from Court that he found Louis dead on the floor. I later found out, Court forgot to give him his medicine. I immediately blamed Court for Louis' death. But we had an autopsy done, and they did not know why Louis died. - I just wanted to be there, - and to hold his paws, As he took his last breath. I feel like Court took that away from me because I wasn't able to do that. I have been able to move on from blaming Court for Louis' death. I have moved on from... I don't think I'll ever move on. - Fanci. - Fanci. Fanci. - I can't... I don't think - you're supposed - To be excited when they come, - you're supposed to stay chill. - Hello. - My God, my baby. Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my goodness, my mom, your mom is back, your mom is back. - Kam, I don't think that's how it's supposed to work. - We missed her so much. Honey, you graduated from puppy school. When I brought Fanci home, she was wild. - She would bite my tennis shoe, - and make me drag Her down the street. Fanci, did you do this? - She would potty - everywhere she wanted, No concern, no remorse. - Look how excited - she is to see us. - Kam, aren't you supposed to - not greet her when she comes in? - Was that okay? - We're gonna cover that. - Oh, okay. Louis did whatever he wanted. With Fanci, I wanna show her, mommy is not a pushover. I didn't talk to you about this, but I got a doggy bjorn. - Is that for when she can't walk anymore? - I just thought - it'd be so fun to like go In a walk with her in my pouch. - Well, let's, let's find out - if that's a good idea or not. - I always give people a hard - time to have the strollers. - Oh, we have one. - We have a stroller. - My favorite thing to say is, - I'm so sorry about - your dog's legs. - You know, - I hope they get better. - Dogs wanna walk. - Yeah. - Fish swim, birds fly, dogs walk. - So we're gonna cover - a lot of stuff like that. I'm happy to be here today. - Thank you for letting me - have Fanci, But this intervention is needed. What happened at the front door is the problem. "Oh, my God, my baby" all that stuff. We can't continue to create that type of energy around her, - and build that type - of relationship with her. I do have a schedule for you. - Okay. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, she's so sweet, - look at her. She's looking at us. - Down. - She like, - looks at us with her eyes. And like puts a spell on you. - We're gonna have to have a little bit more self-control. - So, it's not - sorority rush every time - She sees her - That's right. We call it impulse control. So I'm asking that of her, I'm gonna ask it of you. - Is it true that - like people start looking Like their dog like over time? - You know, - like that saying, like, Oh, you start looking like your dog? - I hope so. I hope your hair looks like this. So, given your history, this is Fanci's accountability schedule. - No way. - All the house rules are right here. - Look at her schedule. So I can do the elliptical and she could do treadmill right next to me. - Absolutely. - Mommy-daughter workout. - Why don't we get started with the treadmill? - Okay. - Okay.

Look at that. - So I'm gonna hold - the leash at first. - Okay. - There she is, so she's smelling it because she's not used to the amount of-oh, no. Fanci, you're not supposed to do that. - It's literally just - the presence of Kameron. - Right. - You said - she's potty trained. - You made me look bad, Fanci. - No. It's not you, it's someone else. - Court thinks I - cannot train Fanci, Are you kidding me, Court?

Good. You look so pretty. Is this new? - No, it's old actually. - Oh, I've never seen that. - You know, we have to change - our dinner plan, - So I had to wear - an outdoor outfit. - I can't believe it. - I love your earrings, - where did you get those? - They're Oscar de la Renta. - Are they new? - Uh-uh. - They're a darling. - No. I'm recycling. - So I can take pay - for my business. - Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited, recycling. - That's right. Before coronavirus, my skin care business was doing phenomenal. - Just got a paycheck, - I was so excited, The first of this month, and I haven't had a paycheck in a while so... - If you've got - your first paycheck, - I guess that means the company - is starting to turn around. - It's doing amazing. - Then coronavirus hit, - and everything came To a screeching halt. - Okay. So what I did for you, - since we couldn't get A Bob's tonight because the governor has all these orders in place, I brought Bob's to you. - D'Andra was working so hard to keep the company going I started 25 years ago. - And she said, "Mother, I don't - know what I'm gonna do." - And I said, - "You know what? - I'm gonna give you - a hundred thousand dollars." - I know it got - you over that hump. And I think things are getting better now. - Okay. Let's go out, and have - a glass of champagne and... - Oh, I love this. - Now, that's new. - That's new. - Lordy, help me. - One thing. - See, at the beginning, D'Andra had not proved to me - that she was really - gonna work hard. - I may have to go - and, you know, - Get it... separate my company, - and get an investor, - But I just - want you to know that. - I'd love for you to do that. - You can go out here and sell - on the street, if you want to. I don't really give a rip what you do. Your mother is not gonna be your bank. It's not gonna happen, so good luck, honey. Her dad would be so proud of her now if he was alive. Because she has changed that way. She's taken full responsibility of that company to make it work. - I'm glad we're out, and I'm tired of staying at home. - You won't believe what I did. I got Tiffany, because she's so short. Right there is a pillow. - Okay. - Oh, there she is. - Oh. - Hi. Here comes my little girl. - Well, - I had to do a little change - Of the outfit because - we're outside. - - oh, my gosh. It's good to see you, boo. - Good to see you. - Hi, darling. - Hi. - You look so cute. Oh, my gosh. - I just came from work. - Did you... did you work today? - I worked all day. I was in the OR. Then I went home to take my decontamination shower - because I just feel kind - of gross. - Uh-hmm. - Oh. I feel like a queen. - Would you like some champagne? - Oh, you are a queen. No. You're the queen. - One day, my mother - came in, and said, "Oh, D'Andra, I met the guru of anesthesiology." - She reminded me a lot of my personality. She's intelligent. She's beautiful. I love her. - That's why she's the favorite daughter. - Oh, I'm so glad to have you. - Thank you. You guys had some lunch? Oh, you started already. - I started without you. - Thank you for having me. - Tiffany is the smarter, less chunky daughter. - Oh, yeah. She's... - Probably because she doesn't sit around and eat donuts. - Mother. - You know? - How's work going? - I mean, how's the hospital? Are you at capacity? - We are not yet at capacity. But we don't want to get to that level. - You know, there's like green, - yellow, and red, And I would say we're yellow. - Uh-hmm. - Okay. I don't know - if I told you. I got a call from Kameron the other day. She invited me to her garage sale. You knew about those? - She mentioned it to me very briefly. You wanna go together? - Yes. - I'll come pick you up. - Do you know - who's gonna be there? - Uh-uh. - Have you met Stephanie? - Uh-hmm. Travis and I serve on the board of directors for the family place. - Of course, you do. - Oh, my goodness. Yeah. - Smart people. - So have you ever met Brandi? Do you know Brandi? - Yeah. I mean, I know her. She seems super fun. I mean, she's got her hands full with her three kids. - Have you seen the video? - Yeah. - You look so good. - Thank you. - I feel like you're - in a good place, I can tell. - I mean, I feel like everything that's been going on in this world has been so crazy. And I'm not gonna lie, like everything with all the racist stuff, like it's just... it's kind of triggered a little bit. It's like kind of brought me a little bit back to that. - Girl. - About three and a half years - ago, I made a video, And posted it on my Instagram Story. The video was of me making fun of my squinty eyes. Oh, everybody ask me. What Asian I am because of my eyes, they squinty. I understand that I hurt people, and honestly, it was stupid and ignorant. - I feel horrible about it, and it's awful, and I know that she didn't mean to do anything to hurt anyone. I adore Brandi. We have fun together. - She's one of the funniest people - I've ever met in my life. - She is. - I mean it was in poor taste. - I don't think she had any ill-intent in her heart. She's not that kind of person. I think you're gonna like her. - I did it in front of my - children, it's horrible, And I, I wanna be a good example for my children, and I was wrong. - Your kids know - you're a good person, girl. - The reaction of people was, you know, to cancel me, that I was a horrible person, a horrible mother. I couldn't say I was sorry enough. I was wrong in that moment. I'm like, I'm ashamed of that. I went away for treatment because I was suicidal. I had so much guilt and shame, that I just... I needed help. I was willing to like end my life for, because I didn't... - I felt like - that's what I should do. - Brandi, no. No. Never, never, never. - You made one mistake, Brandi. - One mistake. - I will tell you that I actually have dealt with racism, being an immigrant and learning English when I was six years old, - and my parents - had to deal with it. - But I don't, for one minute, - think that Brandi Had any hate in her heart towards Asians. - Or anybody else. - I don't believe that. - I know her. I know she's... I - mean, she's a Christian. She knows that what she did was wrong. Don't you agree with me, mom? - Yes. - It was a moment in time where you learn a big lesson, and you change your life, right? - Don't you think? - Oh, yeah. For sure. I'm extremely sorry for my actions, - and the pain - that I caused people, Like I... I'm putting that pain back on myself, and I'm ashamed, and I'm sorry. - I'm so thankful for you. - Oh, my God, girl. I love you. I... you're my... you're my sister. I love you. - I love you, too.

That is not a scientific term. - No. - Gobble, gobble. - Oh, my God. What? No. - Oh, my God. They're checking - the red carpets out. - I have to go watch. - That is like... What is going on? - This is not for real. - Maybe that's just something - Redheads do, - show each other their vaginas. I don't know. - Our vaginas are twins. - Yeah. - We're matching. - Oh, my God. Okay, hers is a little... mine's a little orange. - Yes. - Oh, my God. I love it. Woo! - This conversation has completely devolved. - We have matching vaginas. - She had, like- wait, wait- - There's never been a ginger that I haven't liked or loved. - Thank you guys - so much for coming. I love having you guys. - It's been quite the situation - being in home. I think it really makes you appreciate friends, and - what's really important in life. - Amen. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Clink, clink, clink. - Situation. - So we are gonna go - around the table. - Oh, God, I'm scared. - Don't get scared. - Are you gonna show - your vagina? - No. - Yes. - I'm in. - I'm just kidding. - We are gonna go - around the table, And tell the positives and negatives about being in quarantine. Okay? So my positives about quarantine, I have had amazing, - like, quality time - with my kids. Here we are, just watching a lot of TV. And my negatives has been my business. Because I really wanted to start making my own money, and it's been a really tough time. Towards the end of last year, - my business was - really-oh, my gosh, - Thriving, - and I was so proud, - And we were doing so, - so good. - Kary has an amazing jewelry line. - Yes, - so I finally have a piece. - No way. - Beautiful. - Oh, my God. - Beautiful. - That's amazing. - Then the pandemic hit, and it just completely took that all away from me. Cheers. - Cheers. - That's my thing. - So for me, I decided to take a couple of spiritual journeys. I started to see a shaman. I'd like to be softer, more compassionate, less reactive. - I got off - all my antidepressants, All my ADD medication. If I hadn't slowed down from coronavirus, it never would've happened. - I have no idea what a shaman is. Like, I think of a magical wizard. I feel like shamans should be like in the movie, like, Lord of the Rings. - It was about maybe three weeks in to this pandemic that one of my twins, we were talking about something, - and she was like, - "Mommy, I like coronavirus." - And I was like, - "What did you say?" - And she was like, - "It's because you're home more." - And I was like, "Oh." - Aww. - Like, seriously - - I really enjoyed - being with my family more. Back when COVID first hit, we basically cancelled all elective surgeries. So I was working slightly less hours. But now my work schedule is crazy. - You know, - on a more serious note, I have patients that I've taken care of who have succumbed to this. There is some real devastation going on in a lot of people's lives. So, it's, it's been tough. Yeah. If I encountered someone who said coronavirus is not real, it's a hoax, it's a liberal agenda, it's a conspiracy, I would just say to them, "Let's not be friends for now." - My sister has COVID right now, and she's okay. But it's just like, you think that - until it touches you, - you're like, "Oh, it'll never happen to me." - I'm a doctor, - I went to medical school, I'm a scientist. There's a novel coronavirus, it is infecting people, and some of those people are very sick and dying. Like, those are facts, like, the sky is blue, right? - I'm gonna back it up just a little bit before COVID. 2020 didn't start off the best for me. I made a very ignorant, insensitive choice and, um... and I'm sorry. I made a very ignorant, insensitive choice, and, um... and I'm sorry. I lived with a lot of shame, - and I'm still carrying - it with me. I went to mental health facility that helped me through. You know, because I was like - nobody wants to be friends - with me anymore, - And that's the last thing - I wanted, - So I thought that maybe I should - make my life go away. I want you all to know that I'm very grateful for all of you. And I think that's what I got out of it. I have amazing friends that have been here for me, and I thank you all. - I love you, babe. - Cheers for that one. - We love you. Cheers. - Yeah. - Cheers - for being so vulnerable. - And can we get some alcohol - in here. - Everyone sort of got - - I'm just - a little bit confused How upset she is. It's almost like a kid who hits another kid, but then starts crying. We should talk later. - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - I feel like I'm going to cry. - Okay. - That's a lot. - I know. - So the difference between what LeeAnne did - and what Brandi did - in the video, - LeeAnne was doing it - out of hate. - Come on, Mexican. I thought you were all Mexican and strong. Miss, I can defend myself because I'm from Mexico. But the little chirpy Mexican has to have her way. - Brandi's video was very ignorant and stupid. But she has been so devastated about it, - and I think that she will never - do something like that again. Sadly, you know, I never saw that from LeeAnne. - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah. - I was at Brandi's house - the other day, - And she told me- - I didn't know - That she was taking it - that hard - And that she was suicidal. - Oh, my gosh. - I had no idea. - I need a drink. - Wait, I'm gonna... I'm gonna - make a shot. - Oh. - Yeah, here you go. You want one of these? - I don't like those. - I need to get this in here. - I don't like those. - Um, are you good? You guys... you two need talk. - You two need to talk. - Shots! - Yeah. - Are those, like, quiches over there? I feel like we should just eat. - Can we just start food? - I'm so hungry. - I'm starving. - We're eating, people. - Yay. Love to eat. - Is this the eating crowd? - Okay. - Are we okay to eat, - Stephanie? - Yup. Eat. - Okay. Thanks. - This is amazing. - Uh-hmm. - Wow. - Is Brandi okay out there? - She's good. I think she's just having - a heart-to-heart with Tiffany. - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Where do I even start? - I don't want you think - that I'm like, coming at you - Or attacking you - or anything. But I think I would be remiss if I just sat silently like complicit. - Like, this is my opportunity - to stand up - And say, like, - what you did was wrong. - Like, it hurt a lot - of people's feelings. - Hundred percent. - Hundred percent. - It was in poor taste. You know that. - I mean... I was ignorant And I was insensitive, and I, I made a mistake. And- - Yeah. - And I just wanna share - a little part of my story - with you. So, when I was three years old, my parents immigrated to America without me, they left me behind to, like, have the opportunity for a better life. So from the time I was three until the time I was six, I did not see my parents. They left me with my grandparents, and then, when I was six, they put me on a plane from Beijing to New York by myself, and I landed in America to meet my parents. But, like, I hadn't seen them for three years. I knew not a lick of English. Not a lick. And I went to school and people did this thing. They did this thing to me. - Next time on - "The Real Housewives of Dallas". - My other family kind of just resurfaced out of the blue. There was a big fight over the family estate. How did you and Kary get along? - I've been bullied before. - Do it, do it, do it. - Am I in middle - school again? Because I sure as hell feel like it. - We got a low ball offer. - This time, we're doing a fast close. - I'm not telling you until it is closed. - All y'all are gonna eat - a chicken foot. Oh, my gosh. - Oh, God. That's... oh, God. - Are there barf bags anywhere? OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
