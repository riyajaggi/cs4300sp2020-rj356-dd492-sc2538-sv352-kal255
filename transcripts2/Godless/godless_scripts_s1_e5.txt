 [WIND HOWLING] [FRANK] Beautiful country, ain't it? Good Book says prosperity is the path to godliness. That if God wanted man to be poor, he wouldn't have surrounded him with so much bounty. Which Good Book are you referring to? You sure know how to pick fine horseflesh, son. If you get to reading someday, you might come across a fellow named Xenophon. Xenophon? Come on, Frank.

 Why don't you just admit you make this stuff up? [CHUCKLES] He was a Greek fellow. A student of Socrates and, some say, the first real horseman. He believed that horses, being prey animals and all... their greatest instincts... were fear, flight... and, lastly, fight. So, on account of that, old Xenophon thought taming them made more sense than breaking them. And that... rather than hauling and beating the animal...

 he would use a bit of rope... some gentle restraint... and kindness. Do it that way. Not natural for a horse to be laid down. Makes him amenable, but full of fear. Makes it hard for him to do what he wants to do, which is bolt. So he's got to trust you. Despite what some men think... it's not just about showing him who's boss. It's about showing him that you're the one who's gonna feed him... and water him. You're the one who's gonna take care of him. [HORSE NICKERS] It's about showing him... that he can trust you. Always and forever. [GUNSHOT] Move, boy, and I'll open your fucking head. [FRANK] That was a fine animal you just shot. My name is Ben Broome, and I own a spread about 60 miles east of here called the Double B. Lucky you. Maybe you can tell me, sir, how it happens that them there horses grazing yonder all got my brand on them? They must have just wandered off. [BEN CHUCKLES] Oh... That they did, with a little help from you and your son there. You accusing me of something, Mr. Broome? Oh, no, sir. I'm too busy and too damn tired to waste that kind of time, so I'm just gonna hang the both of ya and be done with it. [FRANK SIGHS] This ain't my death, boys. Don't be afraid, son. I'm right here. [CHOKES] [HORSE GRUNTS] Come on, get it done. We gotta round up them horses over... [GUNSHOT] [SPLUTTERS] [BODY THUDS] [GATZ] Now... if the rest of you want to live... you'll unbuckle them belts and throw them into the brush. [HORSE WHINNIES] [ROY GASPS] [CHOKING] What took you so damn long? That stream was positively afire with trout. [CHOKING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS AND WHEEZES] You just ask and they would bite. I ain't ever seen a thing like it in my whole life. [GRUNTS] [COUGHS] [PANTING] [BEN GROANS] Frank. [FRANK] Where are you running to, Mr. Broome? [GRUNTS] You best kill him, son. Mr. Broome don't strike me as the type of fella who forgives and forgets, and I don't much like looking over my shoulder. [BEN GROANS] The man was gonna hang the only kin you had... without so much as a nod. Family's everything, son. Without family, we're lost. Do you trust me, son? 'Cause I ain't your brother. I will never leave you. Not ever. You understand? Now, do as you're told. [EXHALES] [THUNDER RUMBLES] Keep it. It's yours now. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [INSTRUMENTAL THEME MUSIC PLAYS] I'm not used to such strong spirits. Well... a lady should never walk home alone in the night. Least of all... go into a darkened house all by herself. Oh, it's all right. Mrs. Ehrlich is sitting up with Luke tonight. I'm sure she lit a lantern for me. Luke? My baby. I told you about him, how he almost died. Yes, of course. You thought he had the fever or something. Rubella. But it was that terrible snake that almost got him. If it wasn't for Mr. Ward, he'd be dead, for sure. Now, who's Mr. Ward? A young man helping Alice Fletcher with her horses. Oh, Alice Fletcher. [CHUCKLES] Of course. The woman that married a savage, stole her parcel from Mr. Leopold, had his sons killed and put a curse on the whole town. How could I forget? About almost none of that is true. I don't believe Alice is evil, but I do think the old lady has powers. Mr. Ward. Tell me about him. He shot the head off a sidewinder... that was about to sink his wicked fangs into my boy. Shot the head off a snake? Yes, sir, from across the room. Well, that is some shooting. [ROY] "Untro... Untrod..." Untrod..." Good. [ROY] "...by serf..." serf... "or by..." [SOUNDS OUT WORD] [SOUNDS OUT WORD] "...slave." By... By serf or by..." [SOUNDS OUT WORD] [SIGHS] - "...slave." - Good. - "Slave." - Good. [GRUNTS] [HORSE NICKERS] - Ready! - [GATE OPENING] [ROY] Whoo! Go on, now! Get! Go on! [GRUNTS] [PANTING] Haul it up! [GRUNTS] [WATER GUSHING] Hallelujah! You best climb up out of there. [GRUNTS] [TRUCKEE] Hey, Roy! I'm gonna rope me this burro! You sure you got that horse saddled proper? Yes, sir. Watch this. Nicely done. [CALLIE AND PUPILS] A. E. I. O. U. And sometimes Y. That's right. Sorry we're late. [DOOR CLOSES] Jeremiah, why don't you come up and write out the rest of the alphabet for us? I'll be back directly. Maggie? You could apologize, you know? Me? For what? You hurt me. That's rich. I don't fathom how one person can simply forget when another person tells her she loves her! Shh. I don't care who knows it, or what anyone thinks! I never did! But I never thought you would be just like them. That you would see me the same as they do. How does that little Fritz bitch see you? Naked. Every square inch. [ONLOOKERS MURMURING] What y'all staring at? Fuck y'all. [ONLOOKERS GASP] [MURMURING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [MAJOR LOWELL] Well, Frank Griffin is no longer my problem. Not since Geronimo and a few hundred of his red-peckered Apache cousins decided to cross the border into Arizona last month. Have you been up to Creede, Major? Had a look at what Griffin and his cousins did? Those folks tried to take the law into their own hands. Mm-hm, because there weren't no law to look after them. Sooner or later, men like Griffin find the wrong end of the rifle. It's just a matter of time. And until that happens? Well, he's the responsibility of brave men, such as yourself. Major, he's not far. All right? I saw him but a day past at the Purgatoire River. I bet your Crows could pick up on his trail and have him in hand within a week. I bet we could, too. But, like I said, my orders point me elsewhere. Good hunting, Sheriff. [MCNUE] Well, I can't take Griffin on my own. That's for damn sure. It'd be suicide. So go home to your children. I can't do that, either. Not without a head to show for it. This head will bring your family luck? You found the man. Is that not enough for you? Let me ask you something, Mr. Wise Old Shoshone Nuisance. You go on a buffalo hunt, how does it feel if you come home with a rabbit? Not so good. But I come home. [DOG BARKING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [HORSE SNORTING] [MAN] That's close enough. You all just turn around, go back the way you come, or else. Or else what? [MAN] Else we shoot ya. What the holy fuck do you think "else" means? How many is "we"? [MAN] There are ten of us. [FRANK] In that little shack? [MAN] That's right. Now, get! [MAN] Did I hit anybody? No, sir. At least, not in the general vicinity. See if you two can't roust whoever's inside without killing them. - [MAN GRUNTS] - Olly olly oxen free! - [CLATTERING] - [MAN GROANS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] He's all by hisself. What's your name, friend? [COUGHS] Fuck you. Well, Mr. Fuck You, I'm looking for Sister Lucy Cole, used to live in this here shack. Oh, yeah? Well, she moved. How far back? Oh, six months or so. [FRANK] Where did she go? I heard Ponca City. Bought a saloon up there. [SIGHS] Reckon it's worth waiting around some, see if he comes back here? He's already come back here, left behind some of our money. You think the money's here? Not no more, it ain't. I think now it's in the walls of a saloon in Ponca City. - [PIANO PLAYING] - [MEN WHISTLING] ♪ The Trinidad girl is a haughty thing ♪ ♪ If she kisses at all it's on the wing ♪ ♪ The Catskill girl is the one to collar ♪ ♪ Kisses you good for half a dollar ♪ [SARAH] ♪ The E'town girl gives a kiss so sweet ♪ [TOGETHER] ♪ The poets all fall down at her feet ♪ [CHARLOTTE] ♪ There's the Red River girls Ah, two for a song ♪ ♪ Kissing for meal tickets all day long ♪ ♪ But don't forget the girls of La Belle ♪ ♪ Won't kiss even Mama For fear she'll tell ♪ [MAN] Sing it!

Jesus. That's a new one. How did you meet her? Well, a bunch of them came into Asa's store, as they do every few weeks. And she was sitting there in the wagon... with her fiddle. So I-I come by, and I told her I had one, too, but I couldn't play it. So she told me to come on out and see her. Is that your daddy's fiddle? I remember he used to play some. Yeah. I can't play a damn lick, but... I remember him saying how much my mama liked music. She taught him, and that's how he... that's how he wooed her. So I was thinking that, uh... I don't know. If I go out there again, Elias, her daddy, said he's going to take the switch to Louise. That's quite a spot you got yourself into. She kissed me, though. - Did she, now? - Yeah. - Hm. - It was the most incredible thing. Her lips were just like these puffy little... I really don't care what her lips were like. Damn it, Maggie, I got all these feelings. Well, best keep them to yourself. [SIGHS] I don't... I don't know what I feel. I feel like I sprained my damn heart. You wouldn't know what I'm going through. [GRUNTS] Ain't nothing so fragile as a young man. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [INSECTS CHIRPING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [FOOTSTEPS] [HORSE WHINNIES] [THUNDER RUMBLES] "Dearest Lil." I have just supped at Cold Spring on... ham, beans, chili... warm bread, crackers, and coffee... and have walked along the road to see if I could not kill an... "an... antelope." [THUNDER RUMBLES] Jesus Christ. The man's writing about what he ate for supper. - Where did this come from? - I found it in the river. Old stagecoach went sideways. I thought I'd hand it over to McNue when he gets back. "Dear Joseph." As soon as I collect my money, I'm leaving Cimarron for a qui... quieter place... as, 'Who was shot?' is the first question miners ask when they come in from their diggings on a Saturday night. "Seldom is the answer 'no one.'" I've been to Cimarron. I know what this fella's talking about. Read this one. "My own darling husband." No letter from yesterday's mail... and the stage not running, so I... I do not know whether I have any today or not. You cannot know how I long for my daily crumbs. "I feel so th..." [SOUNDS OUT WORD] - "Thoroughly." - "Thoroughly"? "...thoroughly alone here that it," by the most natural p-process, launches my thoughts and desires westward... in an untold degree. I wonder if you'll be glad to see me upon your return. I wonder if the long months haven't blurred the clearness of my outline... and the joy of my com... "compan..." "Companionship." "...companionship." How I look forward to even a short interval of having you alone with me and all the antic... - antic..." - "Anticipation." "...anticipation of a bride to her honeymoon." For I know that if I had the chance to make love to you... and you were not too shy... I think I could be quite entertaining... for a little while. Until then, I'll kiss your image carried in my memory and never cease wishing it were real. "Your devoted wife, Anna." She writes straight. She does. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [TRUCKEE] Mama? [LUCY] Roy, are you just going to leave without saying goodbye? My brother ain't ever coming back. I want to give you something. Maybe you'll learn to read. I wish I'd had more time. [WAGON CLATTERING] [HORSE SNORTS] Ain't that your horse, Frank? [WHISTLES] [HORSE WHINNIES] [ROY CRIES OUT] [GATZ] That didn't quite work out as you planned, now, did it? [ROY GROANS] Good Book says pain is its own teacher. You got a good eye for horseflesh. Best animal I ever had. Tireless, sure-footed... [SNIFFS] ...and mean. [CHUCKLES] Son... you ain't gonna shoot me. Not now or ever. That ain't how I'm gonna go. I know what you're thinking. No fella can know his own demise. But me, I've seen mine. I know exactly how it's gonna happen. So when my death comes, I'm gonna be ready... on account... I already lived it. [ROY GROANS] Tell me, son. Have you got a pappy? [GRUNTS] Me neither. [FRANK] I was born right here at Bald Knob. I ain't saying I hadn't lived some before but... it's here I was born, if you follow. All of us were. And it's here you'll be born, too. Winchester '73. Best firearm in the West. A repeating rifle makes 20 men out of one. Can hit one of those boys in the black of the eye from all the way down here. Got to be 400 yards. Well, a rifle can still bite you hard at 400 yards. Of course, then... them boys on the other side wouldn't much like that. Then we'd be in a real pinch, wouldn't we? [CHUCKLES] That's the kind of shooting I don't like being in the middle of. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [FRANK] Roy Goode... say hello to Dyer Howe... Bud Ledbetter... Bill Chick... Floyd Wilson... and Alonzo Bunker. Go on, have a seat. You all need a bath. And a shave. Fuzz looks good on a peach, not a man. [ALONZO LAUGHS] [DYER] Is that from the Bible there, Frank? Burma-Shave. Midget barber had it on the wall up in Denver. - Remember him? - [LAUGHTER] Yes, sir, I do. [CHUCKLES] [ALONZO] Go on, son. Eat. Gonna make you big and strong... like me. [ROY CHEWING] [GRUNTS] You've been poor your whole life, I assume? Life's hard. It's already hard, of course, but it's even harder without luck. Bible says that? Have yourself a look. I can't read. That's all right. I can read for both of us. You've got a family now, son. These are your brothers... and I aim to be your pappy. And a good one, too. I won't mistreat you. I won't beat you. And I won't ever lie to you. Ever. Welcome home, son. [FRANK] There's different sorts of men. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Some don't have the taste for a fight. But they can talk, they can reason. That's almost as good. Then there's some men who can only talk through their guns or their fists. There ain't no reasoning with a man like that. A man like that comes at you, you best just be prepared to meet him. Prepared how? That's what I aim to teach you. [YOUNG ROY] That's only a toy. - How come I don't get a real one? - [FRANK] You ain't ready. Go on, take it. Keep it in your hand all day... until it feels strange not to have it there, until you miss it... like it's part of your arm. I want to shoot a real gun. What are you gonna shoot at? Any man who tries to shoot me. [CHUCKLES] Let's say you get shot, anyhow. Then what? Then I guess I die. And would that be so bad? Death ain't such a big deal. It's dying that's no goddamn fun. Ain't nothing scarier than a man with a gun. And ain't nothing more helpless than a man without one. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [THUNDER RUMBLES] It seems like she's doing better. Well, she's nearly rode out. But she's gentle. And she can still pull a wagon. I thought she'd be good for Sadie... and her little one. That one there is ornery. Keeps on biting the others. I thought the sheriff's sister might like him. [CHUCKLES] That one there is yours. Why is that? She always keeps her head up. - Thought we'd take them in tomorrow. - Roy... Then I have to go. There's something I gotta finish. You're gonna kill Frank Griffin. When I first left Frank... I spent some time in the Fairview Hills. The more I was alone, the more I began to have a bad time with myself. I was getting these crazy thoughts. I just could not leave Frank alone, so I started harassing him. I'd follow him, then I'd steal from him. - Why? - I don't know. Maybe it's because I couldn't kill him. At least, not until I heard what he did in Creede on account of me. Then it all went wrong in Doubtful Canyon. Wrong how? Neither of us died. After that, I went back to Moses to... rebury my daddy. Something I'd always swore I'd do. It ain't right, putting a man straight into the dirt like that for all eternity, so I dug him up... moved him, and... dug him a whole new grave. After that, I was so tired I... thought I'd lie down and bleed out right beside him. And while he was nothing but bones, his clothes were all still there. They hadn't rotted away. I don't know how that could have happened. I recalled him wearing them clothes. Now I'm older than he was when he died, so I was recalling a younger man. I've lived longer than he did. Just then, it seemed right to me that I put on my daddy's clothes. I don't know, I wasn't thinking straight. I was dying. So... maybe I figured, by doing that, I'd end up wherever he is. So I laid down alongside him and just waited to die. Waited all night. Then, at dawn, I had this vision. I realized then that hell is gonna follow me wherever I go. I realize now that I don't ever want it to follow me here. [CALLIE] You made them yourself? Nearly 50 pair. I hope the new preacher won't frown upon it. I want to sell them... through the mail. Through the mail? I know, it sounds crazy, but if Sears and Roebuck could do it, I could, too. But they got a catalogue. That's why I asked Mr. Grigg about taking out an advertisement in his paper. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] He said an advertisement costs $5, but that he would do it for free if I... If you what? [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY] You don't you worry about a thing. And don't you talk no more to Mr. Grigg about it. I'll give you whatever you need. [THUNDERING HOOVES IN DISTANCE] Did you hear that? [HORSES WHINNYING] [HORSE WHINNIES] There's someone I gotta see. Who, pray tell, is that woman? Cause of all our distress. Really? That's her? That's the famous Alice Fletcher? [GRIGG] And that, I'm guessing, is her hand, Mr. Ward? [ASA] That's him. [GRIGG] Not from around here, then, is he? [ASA] Not that I know of. Where all do you suppose he come from? She broke him out of jail. [CHUCKLES] I wanted to return this to you. That was fast. He's a fast learner. I imagine so. There's something else. I was wondering if you would like to buy my ranch. Your ranch? I'll give you a fair price. Why me? Well, I thought I'd start with the richest person in town. There's a well, freshly dug. House and the barn are in good shape. I've got most of the land fenced. It's tempting. But I'm thinking of leaving, myself. Nothing here for me. When the mine starts back up, all that will change, won't it? I don't want to go back to that. No. No, I don't see as you would. Thanks for the book. You've proved it up so nice. Be a shame for you to leave. [DOOR CLOSES] You steal that from me? Watch. [CLATTERS] Well done. When you gonna teach me? More than likely never. How come? You want to teach me everything else. Well, I ain't teaching you how to be no show-off. I don't think you even know how to do it. Well, you're right, I don't. I just... I just know how to get it clear of my holster without shooting my damn foot off. The rest is just silly nonsense. And know what else? I'm done talking with you about guns. [LOGAN] Don't shoot! [CHUCKLES] Don't shoot. We meet again. I always get a bad feeling... when I keep running into a man I don't know. Makes me wonder. Tell me, friend, should I wonder about you? No. There's plenty of others more worrisome than me. You understand I'm the new law around here? What happened to the old law? Your guess is as good as mine. Well, sir, I ain't your problem. I'll be leaving real soon. Town? Territory. Boy. You remember me? [CHUCKLES] Look at him. You can just tell he'd like to knock the turkey out of me. [LAUGHS] How about I get down off this animal and give you one free shot? How about I pull you off? [CHUCKLES] We'll be on our way, sir. Yeah, you will. You feel better? I do. - And nobody got shot. - Nope. [TRUCKEE] I sure do hate that man. Someday, I'll get him back. I don't doubt it. But you just keep in mind, if a person ain't careful... they can make a profession out of revenge. Shot the head off a snake. synced & corrected by PopcornAWH www.addic7ed.com
