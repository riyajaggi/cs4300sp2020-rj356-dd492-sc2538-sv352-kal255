 Whoa. Whoa. [flies buzzing] [horse nickers] Whoa. You know this here is all bad business, don't you, boy? Cheap spectacles. [mutters] Bunch of bullshit. Are you really that dumb, Mr. Goode... that you would ride yourself into a wall? Or were you really that smart? [echoes of hooves thundering]

 Either way... they must've thought they had you cold. [men yelling] [gunshot] [horse whinnies] The way you had to run him... the poor animal must have bottomed out. Wasn't no way he was gonna make it. So you set him free. [whinnies] [men yelling] [gunshot] But now it was you that had them. Seven men down in the time it takes to spit.

 [buzzing] And all dead before they even hit the ground. Except one. I imagine they became real disenchanted after all of that... and rode off. But of course... they came back. It was over... even before it started. You saw it? Enough of it. Get... Was it how it reads? One man run off the whole bunch? If you had seen the man shoot, you would run off, too. They're all on the hanging road now. What are you, Navajo? Shoshone. Shoshone? The hell you doing down here? Besides sneaking up on me. Living. Game's all dried up on the reservation. And I didn't sneak up on you. You didn't see me. Can you even see me now? I can see just fine. Is that why you almost fell over that dead horse down there? The man who did all the fancy shooting... you recall what he looked like? Like Death. [grunts] Could you be more specific? Hm. "Hm"? "Hm," what? You lost your shadow. [dog barks] [instrumental theme music plays] Frank Griffin was born in Arkansas, but raised by Mormons in Utah. He come out with the Fancher party when he was but a boy. That's them folks who got massacred by the Indians back in '54. Was the Mormons done it, but they laid it on the Paiutes. Hm, so say the Paiutes. The point is, Griffin seems to have lost all hold of hisself ever since Roy Goode left him. Not that he ever had that much of a grip to begin with. Marshal... I appreciate your concern for my well-being, but as you might have noticed, I do got one or two good men with me. I don't give a hoot in hell about your well-being. It's them ladies down in La Belle that worry me. As you know, they only got the one law down there. If you can call him that. [laughter] If I could ask you, sir, until I get a rope around Griffin, to keep your men nearby, that would sure relieve me of my concern. You got nothing to worry about, Marshal. Mr. Logan there, my new head of security, is presently rounding up all the necessary men. Looks to me like he's presently eating his breakfast. Marshal, the Quicksilver Mining Syndicate now has a vested interest in the La Belle claim, which, I might add, holds a rather considerable amount of ore. And we mean to look after it the way we do all our investments. Same way you looked after Creede? Good luck on your hunt, Marshal. Two pounds of flour. A pound of bacon. Another pound of coffee. Two boxes of shells for the Winchester. Forty-four? Fifty ninety-five, if you please. Are you hunting buffalo? Why? You seen any? You break that jar, girl, and you gonna pay for it! Where has your brother run off to? If he didn't tell you, I'm certainly not gonna. Time he gave up that star, don't you think? [Asa] Goddamn it, girl! I told you to keep your hands off! Now, I want you... Go ahead. Yell at her again. [sighs] She's not right in the head. Neither will you be if you keep hauling at her like that. We'll take the licorice, too. [coin clatters] [bell dings] [horse nickers] Aunt Maggie, that lady ain't got hardly any clothes on. No, she does not. [Charlotte] What does she think she's doing? Airing out her privates, looks like. [Charlotte scoffs] I hear she's worth a million dollars. Husband had a brewery in Berlin. Moved to Mexico to open another one. She lost her mind and run off. Her man was in beer? So I'm told. Too bad it wasn't mining. [Charlotte chuckles] Come on, kids. What's all this, then? W-What's all this, then? I asked you first. William! Jesus! Leave that man be. Where does he live, anyways? I don't know. [Whitey] Hey! Mary-Agnes! [horse whinnies] [Roy clicks tongue] All right. Pull her up. Truckee! Whoa. [whinnies] [snorts] [snorts] [whinnies] [Roy clicks tongue] [horse nickers] [grunts] [horse whinnies] [panting] [horse nickers] Down. Whoa. Whoa. [Roy gasps] [hooves beating] [horse whinnies] [grunts] [Roy groans] [horse nickers] [Roy makes kissing cue] Open the gate, boy. What? Open the damn gate! [speaks in Paiute] [laughs] Whoa. Good to see you again, boy. [panting] [clicks tongue] There he is! Y'all got company. We've come for Mr. Ward. [Whitey] Wait. The indecency of what you've done. Breaking a man out of jail like that. Well, it's unspeakable. You're just mad you didn't think of it yourself. [Whitey] Now don't give me no kind of fuss, and we'll just forget what happened last night, all right? Mr. Ward? I'm gonna ask you real nice to take your pick of these two wagons here and climb aboard. Now, I ain't gonna ask you twice. Ladies, I'll make you a deal. Let him stay here and help me break all these horses and I'll sell you all but six for 4,500. That's less than 100 each. You're only gonna keep six? When I'm done, I'm gonna pack up and go home to Boston. This place has never been my home, and, thanks to all of you, it never will be. - Ma'am, I can't let you... - Forty-three hundred. - Done. - Damn it, Mary-Agnes. Sheriff ain't gonna like this. Not at all. Sheriff ain't here. [Mary-Agnes] Whitey... you either go along with this... or we lock you up again. [Whitey chuckles] - What, you think you're faster than me? - No, I know I am. In a pig's ass. You want to try again? Can I offer you all some coffee? That sounds right nice. [indistinct chatter] [Grigg] Marshal! A word! Son, go and get yourself a candy or something. Go on. You care to sit? Please. Now, I hear you're on your way to Olegrande to see Colonel Lowell. If you hear it, it must be true. He's a good man, Jeff Lowell. I interviewed him once. Would this have anything to do with what all went on up in Creede? Are you interviewing me now, Mr. Grigg? If you want to find Frank Griffin... you have to know him. You have to know how he thinks. And you have to know how he and Roy started. And to know all of that... you've got to go and talk to Sister Lucy Cole. Sister who? Lucy Cole. Lives in the town of Moses, near the Oklahoma border. What all has she got to do with anything? Well, she raised Roy Goode from the time he was a whelp to the time he was 15. And you think he might go back there? He already has. A nun saw him up there not more than a few weeks ago. Jesus! How many nuns are there in Moses? [Grigg laughs] Well, Lucy's not really a nun. [chuckles] Not in a spiritual sense, anyway. She calls herself "sister" on account of her gifts have always been... well, more sisterly, if you know what I mean. And you're offering up this free intelligence because...? Oh, I offer nothing for free. No, there's a story afoot. And thanks to Frank, I am smack dab in the middle of it. I'm gonna give you... [pencil scratching] ...Lucy's particulars. [paper tearing] And maybe next time you're in Taos... you'll give me that interview. Oh, I doubt I'll be back this way anytime soon. Air's just a little too thin for me. You see Frank again... tell him John Cook's coming for him. [boy] Marshal Cook? [Grigg] Nathan! [man calls out in Norwegian] [man calls out] [whistling] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Afternoon. [child coughing] That your camp I seen a ways back? You speak English? [coughing continues] Looks like y'all had some company. About 30 men? [coughing] Ma'am. They are a day ahead of us. [yells in Norwegian] [woman speaks in Norwegian] [speaks in Norwegian] Yes... there were 30. He said he would kill us if we ever spoke of him. You'd be wise to believe the man. Do you know these men? I do. Are you hunting them? I am. Just you? They say where they were going? [coughing] [McNue] Your little girl's likely got camp colic. If I was you, I would do her up in mustard, rub her in liniment, then dose her with some hot whiskey. I heard one of them mention a town called Olegrande. Thank you, ma'am. You find them, Sheriff. You find them and you kill them all. [Sadie blows] Hey, Sadie. What are y'all doing up here by yourself? Whatever I can to get this place ready for the new preacher. - Why? Is he here? - Not yet, but he's coming. Are you sure? Yes, I've got the telegram right here. Really? "I will be shortly traveling by rail from Scranton, Pennsylvania to your environs. I look forward to seeing this country and to meeting the La Belle congregation upon my arrival. Yours prayerfully, Pastor Garrett Moore." Ain't that exactly what he said three months ago? Yes. It's the same telegram. It's a long way, Pennsylvania. Yes, ma'am, it is. And he did say he wanted to see the country, so maybe he stopped somewhere along the way... to get a better taste of the... wherever he was. He might well have done. Well, I will, uh... I'll leave you to your work. You do think he's coming, don't you, Whitey? Oh, yes, ma'am. I'm sure it's like you said, he probably stopped off somewhere on the way. You have a good day, ma'am. You, too, Whitey. Where you off to? Oh, no place. I was just gonna go for a ride. Before I go stir-crazy around here. Can't say as I blame you, but you've got to eat first. You're getting too damn skinny. Have you got anything clean to eat with? Um... Yeah. What did I do with that spoon? Oh, yeah. You know where he lives? - [Whitey] John Doe? - Mm-hm. [Whitey] No, I do not. I guess I never really thought about that. Neither have I. Sad fellow, ain't he? Ain't we all? Eat. Bill say anything to you before he left... about what all he was up to? No, not much. Just that he was going after Frank Griffin. That's all he told me, too. He's lost his damn mind. No. He's just tired of feeling useless is all. [sighs] You worried about him? Of course I am. Aren't you? He should've brought me with him. I'd watch his back. I heard about you and those two cowboys the other night. People are talking about that, are they? Well, it was some pretty fancy shooting, if I do say so. So are you gonna paste everybody who makes a smart remark? - I was just getting their attention. - And if you got more than that? Say you shot one of them in the head instead of the arm. That'd never happen unless I wanted it to. There's too much skill on my end. Say one of them shot you. Too much luck. You think you're lucky? Whitey, I hate to break it to you, but your clover don't exactly run deep. Well, I'm lucky I got you. [sighs] You let me outdraw you the other day? No, ma'am. I would never let anyone do that. 'Cause we both know I'm faster without your charity. I do know it. All right. Bring that pot back to me when you're done, washed. - Yes, ma'am. - Christ almighty! Empty that goddamn thunder mug! Yeah. [chickens clucking] You can just hold it right there. - [cocks rifle] - You lost, boy? I don't believe so, sir. I have business with Louise. What sort of business? My lesson. Your what? That you, Whitey? [Louise] Well? Did you bring it? Yeah. Well, come on in, then. [horse whinnies in distance] [horse whinnies] Uh-oh. You best stay on that horse. [yells in Paiute] She says it's bad luck for you to wear her dead son's clothes. [yelling] [grunts] Easy, ma'am! - [Iyovi yells] - [Roy grunts] [yells] - Should I take them off? - [Truckee] It's too late. Now that you've put them on, they're yours. She can't ever have them back. [speaks in Paiute] [speaks in Paiute] [yelling continues] - [Truckee] He's a beauty. - Sure is. Why don't you climb up on him? It's all right, he blowed his wind. He ain't got so much "oomph" no more. I can't ride him. Maybe a smaller one, or one that's a little older. What kind of Indian are you? You can't ride a horse? [Iyovi yelling] [yelling continues] How long you been alone with them women? Long enough to forget who you are? Come on, get on him. I'll hold him. [mutters in Paiute] All right, take him around the fence. You the boss of that animal, son, or is he the boss of you? There you go. There you go. Don't be kicking him too much, that just nettles him. Squeeze him with your legs. Good. There you go. No more mules for you, cowboy! Hey, Ma! [horse whinnies] [Roy] Good. [horse nickers] [grunts and coughs] [Roy] Whoa! Whoa! [coughs] [Roy] Get yourself up. [groans] Get back on him. - Maybe later. - Get back on him now. Grab him by that jaw rope and climb back on top of him. I don't want to. If you don't, he ain't ever gonna respect you. Worse than that, you ain't ever gonna respect yourself. Now, go on, get back up there. And this time, keep him under you. [sighs] [horse nickers] [whinnies] Go on, get hold of him. Don't let him decide. Attaboy. Now, give him his head. There you go. Now, get! Don't haul back on that rope. Keep your heels down so he don't unload you. - Haul him back, boy. - Whoa! Stay on him. Whoa! Whoa! [horse whinnies] [coughs] [coughing] Come on, get up. No. [coughs] Get back on him. All right. [horse snorting] [horse whinnies] Whoa! [horse snorting] [grunts] [horse whinnies] Whoa. Easy now. [Roy] Easy, boy. Good boy. He's your horse now. I don't know how anyone can sleep like that. You ever want children of your own? Couldn't... for whatever reason. But did you want them? I did and I didn't. I wasn't sure I'd be any good at it. Then, just when I thought I might be... it was too late. Let me take care of you. Take care of me? I've saved some money. Have you, now? I've got almost $20,000. We could go anywhere. Twenty thousand? Don't you know? Whores are always the richest people in town. I had no idea. Seems to me you're not getting out of life all it ought to give you. All what you deserve. You want to make me a kept woman? Ain't that the sweetest? I started with nothing. I lost everyone and everything on my way out here. [sighs] You gonna tell me that sad story again? How you came all the way from Virginia with your husband, Walter? Warren. Warren. Died of fever? Appendicitis. And then I was here in this place, all alone. As I recall, you weren't all that alone. I didn't know you even saw me. Oh, I saw you. [sighs] Everybody saw you. Well, I remember the first time I saw you. It was one afternoon. I'm on Magdalena's porch, reading the paper, when you come galloping into town on that bay mare you used to have. As usual, you were all mad at something or other. Well, I watched you glide off that horse in a big flurry of skirts and hair... and that was it for me. I still watch you. All the time. I know everything about you. How you feel. How you taste. How you smell. Hell, lady, I could find you in the dark. [violin screeching] [Louise] Keep your chin up. Like so. Uh-huh. - Like that? - Uh-huh. And the note... is just... there. - That one? - Uh-huh. [discordant playing resumes] That's it. - Like that? - Mm-hm. That don't sound too good. [laughs] That boy is about as musical as a trout. A waste of time, giving him lessons. [playing continues] That boy is not here for no lessons. [Roy] R. O. Y. That's it. What's the matter? Nothing, ma'am. Just... Well, I believe that's the first time I ever wrote my own name. You should keep it. Well, I believe I will. Well, good night, y'all. Good night, then. Thank you. Thank you. [mutters] Goddamn it, Roy! [Louise laughs] I need some real music to wash that awful garbage out of my head. - Grandpa! - No, he's right. I'm terrible. I ain't got no natural ability whatsoever. Not like my mama. She could play anything. You'll get it. It just takes time is all. [footsteps] Louise, say goodbye to your, uh, student... and help your ma get supper going. - Have you eaten supper? - No. I'm sure the folks of La Belle are gonna be missing their deputy before too long. Wouldn't you say, son? Well, yes. Yes. Uh... You know, they can't do anything without me. [guitar tuning] [Whitey chuckles] All right. Thank you. When should I come back... for my next lesson? Whenever you want. I'll be here. Deputy. It's been a real pleasure. [Whitey] Louise. It was nice to meet you, sir. [sighs] [intricate violin playing] [guitar accompanies violin] ♪ Single girl ♪ ♪ Single girl ♪ ♪ She's gonna dress fine ♪ ♪ Oh, she's gonna dress fine ♪ ♪ But a married girl, a married girl ♪ ♪ She wears most any kind ♪ ♪ Oh, she wears most any kind ♪ [horse whinnies] [Roy] Now, we got to be real careful in here. [Truckee] Why? Because there might be grizzlies and cougars and such? [Roy] No, not on account of cougars, on account of the damn trees. Them trees over there are called quaking aspens... or "quakies." They got a lot of ferns that cover up everything, so the ground around them tends to be full of deadfalls... where a horse can get into trouble, hurt itself. [Roy] Whoa. Looks like we ain't the first along this piece of trail. A few of your ma's ponies been through here already. - How come you don't carry a gun no more? - You listening to me, boy? Don't ride under the quakies. How come you don't carry a gun? I don't need one. Unless your ma plans on shooting me again. [Truckee] What was it you used to carry, then? A big pair of .45s, like Whitey Winn? - [Roy] I carried a .38. - Just one? [Roy] One's all I needed. Plus, I never was much with my other hand. Looks like they went this way. [Truckee] How come you didn't carry a .45, like Whitey? [Roy] A .38's lighter. Get it out faster. There ain't so much of a kick. [Truckee] But it's not as powerful. [Roy] Well, it ain't so much the power you've got, but how accurate you are. A .38 will kill what you want it to, but you still gotta shoot straight. [Truckee] And what's that like? What's what like? Killing. [horse whinnies in distance] Now, them trees over yonder are called blue spruce. - Roy. - I seen them. Pay them no mind. Who are they? Boys from the mining company, looks like. - [Truckee] What do they want? - [Roy] They're just looking us over. - They gonna come over here? - They're deciding that right now. [Roy] Now, nothing grows under a spruce, which makes them good for riding under, on account of no deadfalls and you don't have to duck under any low limbs. Did you hear what I said? You can't ride under the quakies, but you can under spruce. That's right. They're gone now. - You didn't even look. - I looked. Now, don't they look happy? Let's go get your mama's horses. [Roy] What's the matter? He's all right, just give him his head. He'll find his own way down. Is there another way? [Roy] Sure. Maybe he'll grow wings and fly down. [sighs] [Roy] Attaboy. I did it. You sure did. [rustling] [horse nickers] [whinnying] Goddamn it, Roy. Get down. [Logan] Hey. Hey! Hey! Whoa! - [horse nickers] - Whoa! Here, take some water. - I'm not thirsty. - Take some anyway. Same bunch? It looks like. We're just a pair of hunters who stopped to take a breather, all right? Shouldn't we at least be on our horses, in case we've got to run? No, we can't outrun them... so we might as well stay on the ground, let them talk down to us. Make them feel confident. Well, well. What do we have here? Howdy. Howdy. Where you two headed? Nowhere special. Just... doing some hunting. Hunting? Don't got much to show for it. No, sir. We haven't had much luck. Are you sure you know how to use that rifle? Sometimes I wonder. - [horse snorts] - Quit! [snorting] Quit! You fucking jackass. Sir, you ain't careful, you're gonna rowel the life out of him. You telling me how to ride this horse? No, sir. Just... Your animal seems to be in some distress, and if you got a ways yet to ride... We don't got much farther... so don't you concern yourself none with this animal. He just don't mind is all. Ain't that right, Ranger? Good boy. Where did you two come from? A ranch, just outside La Belle. - You a hand there? - Yes, sir. What about that one? This... This is my son. [chuckles] I bet you and his mama make a fine pair. [chuckles] Now, you get back to your hunting and stay out of my sight. You understand? Don't you bawl none, boy. No one's even gonna notice. It's gonna blend right in with the smell you already got. You, too, partner. Come on, let's go. [whinnying] Best behavior now, boys. Tell them. Hey, come here. There ain't nothing scarier than a man with a gun. There ain't nothing so helpless as a man without one. - That's why you should carry one. - Should I? Then you could have shot that man. You wanted to. I could tell. You had a look. A look? Same look you had when you shot that snake. So that's what I should have done, huh? I should have shot him? - You didn't have a gun. - Say if I did. Say if you did, too. Say the six of them men with their guns, me with my gun, you with your gun, all commenced shooting at each other at the same time. - Then what? - Then you would have killed them all. Maybe, but like as not, you could be dead, too. And if we were standing in some street, some other folk might be dead, too. But we weren't in a street. You should never have to eat another man's dirt. But sometimes it's easier to go home... with a grudge and your pride sullied some... than it is to go out and get yourself killed. You boys gonna come in and eat or what? We'll be right there with you, ma'am. "Frank Griffin made a surprise appearance in Taos this past Monday evening and gave this reporter an exclusive interview. Griffin informed A.T. Grigg that Roy Goode was to blame for the deaths in Creede and several other mining towns throughout New Mexico and Colorado. Griffin said, 'I aim to take care of those poor devils who treat me with the respect any man deserves, but Roy Goode has betrayed me, and I will kill any man, woman or child who harbors him.'" [hooves beating] That doesn't look like the new preacher. [horse nickers] [Logan] Ladies. My name's Ed Logan, head of security for Quicksilver Mining, the new owners of this here town. From here on in, it's gonna be, uh, we who's gonna be looking after you. Mr. Blacksmith, we're gonna need that whole livery. I expect more men over the next few days. It's $2 a day for the whole place. Fair price. Thank you. I thought there would be more of them. - There will be. - I don't like this. - Of course you don't. - And I do not like him. [Logan] Boy. We're gonna need that sheriff's office, too. Well, that's something you're gonna have to take up with the sheriff. OK. Where might he be at? That's what I thought. From now on, I'm the new sheriff of La Belle, New Mexico, and these here men are all my deputies. Now, ladies and gentlemen... if there's anything you need, I mean anything at all... we're here to help. Let's leave our horses with you, sir... while I check in to your fine hotel. [man] Ma'am. Now, what do you suppose she wants? Miss Dunne... may I speak with you? Privately? Of course. What is it I can help you with, Miss Fletcher? "Alice," please. I was wondering if I could borrow a primer, if you have an extra one? As I recall, your boy can already read and write. Of course. I'll get it back to you. Take your time. [Callie] That's Magdalena, the old madam. You know, you could have made a lot of money in here. How much? At least 200 a month. That's a lot, all right. Twice what my brother makes as a bank clerk in Austin. And tough as you are, you could be a madam, open up your own place and make even more. How much more? A few thousand. Really? A whore's life isn't so bad if you play it right. I mean, who do you think bankrolled half the businesses in this town? Hell, who do you think is paying for your horses? There's more words for "whore" than there is for "doctor" or "lawyer." Really? Tell me some. Thank you. Any time. [door opening] [door closing] [Whitey] That Logan fella's gonna kill this poor horse. If the horse don't kill him first. [scoffs] You push a creature far enough, eventually it will push back. Some men, though, they ain't smart enough to know when they're tempting fate. I seen you riding out to Blackdom the other day. Them folks have their own ways. [Whitey grunts] Yeah, I know that. They can be dangerous, them buffalo soldiers. Them what? Them buffalo soldiers. That's what they all are out there. What, they hunted buffalo? They hunted men for the 10th Cavalry right after the war. Men? What men? Oh, Cheyenne, mostly, but also Comanches and Apaches. They're good gunfighters. Better than most white men. - Why do they call them buffalo soldiers? - Well... John Randall, the uncle of the girl you're so sweet on out there... No, I ain't... I ain't, um... He once, all by himself, held off 70 Cheyenne with only his pistol and a few rounds of ammunition. And by the time help from the nearby camp came, 13 of them Cheyenne braves were dead... and John Randall had a bullet wound to the shoulder and a dozen lance wounds, but he made it. Jesus. The Cheyenne went and spread word about a new kind of soldier that fought like a cornered buffalo. A man who, like a buffalo, suffered wound after wound, but didn't die. A man who, like a buffalo, had him a thick, curly head of hair. So this is Louise's uncle? And her father, and the other men out there. Or that's... that's what they were, anyhow. Now they just want to farm. They want to be left alone. They certainly don't need no white boy riding out there, bringing all his white troubles with him. [dog barks] [Roy] "Buzz... buzz... buzz. This is... the..." [sounds out word] "Song." "...song... of... the... bee." Y'all open for business? Yes, sir. Glass of bonded, please. Supposed to be a cavalry regiment up this way. Yes, sir. They've been out on patrol for over a week now. Range war... up by Eaton. Know when they will be back? No, Marshal, I don't. Where is everybody? [match striking] Hey, there. Marshal. [glass shattering] [Roy] "Buzz... buzz... buzz. This is the song... of the bee." [footsteps] [Frank] What is it? [chuckles] [Roy] "Buzz, buzz, buzz. This is the song of the bee."
