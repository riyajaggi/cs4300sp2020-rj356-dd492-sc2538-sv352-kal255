 "Furrier Morgan Printz returned to Omaha today" after a business trip to Chicago. Mr. Printz said, 'It was 40 degrees cold up there, and this being summer, "I'm mighty glad to be back home in Nebraska.'" Well, you can cross Omaha off my list of exciting places to visit. And that's on their front page? What's going on in Taos? It seems Mr. Grigg wrote about us. Us?

 - Really? - "The Secret of La Belle." Oh, well, now. "The mining town of La Belle," once a vibrant community, suffered an unimaginable loss two years ago "when 200 men died in the mine in a single day." Two hundred? "Today, the town is a gulch of shacks, tents and derailed cars," its main street a continuous mudhole. I personally saw two wrecked rigs "and three dead horses down the cliff." Derailed cars? - There's not even a damn train here. - Dear God.

 Keep reading. "Well, as the old saying goes," it takes a mine to work a mine, and silver has always been a tricky ore to monetize. Even hay goes for $60 a ton these days, so it's no wonder the town, now nearly exclusively inhabited by widows, is so dirt poor. It's also no wonder these desperate ladies would be so willing to harbor a desperate young man, "despite his notorious repute." What desperate young man? "You can only imagine this reporter's surprise" upon learning that it is here in La Belle, among the spinsters, children, and the few broken men, "that the notorious Roy Goode has chosen to hide." Spinsters? "I fear and pray for these wretched women" that they are either long gone or properly defended for the day soon at hand when Frank Griffin and his men ride into town "and make good on his promise to punish any community that harbors his son." That's enough. I-I don't understand. Who's he talking about? What desperate young man? We, uh... We come for Roy Goode. He's gone. Yeah? Well, I'm gonna have a look around. Mister, the only way you're getting off that horse is if I shoot you off. You know what, darling? - I believe you would. - So then you knew who he really was? Not until he turned himself in to Bill. But even after... you still kept him. - Kept him? - You put us in a bad way, Alice. Sooner or later, Frank Griffin's gonna find out he was here. If he hasn't already. I don't understand. Mr. Grigg says that Roy Goode's like a son to Griffin. Whatever betrayal he feels, it's downright biblical. - But if Roy's gone... - Griffin's made it plain. He's gonna kill anyone that Roy Goode loves or cares about. He's already murdered everyone in Creede, and then he burned the town to the ground. If he knows we've been hiding him... That's why he rode off, to keep Frank away from here. He must have told Bill where Griffin was at. Got to be why he went off looking for him. Bill's gone looking for Frank Griffin? I thought the damn fool was trying to prove himself to you. I don't believe that Bill McNue is off looking for anybody. That man's a coward. He's going blind, you dumb quiff. That's why he don't go shooting off his guns. Well, we've got to start figuring out how we're gonna defend ourselves. Y'all got nothing to worry about. We made a promise. We aim to keep it. Not gonna let anything happen to you folks. Really? The five of you are gonna fight Frank Griffin? We're gonna ride right now to San Marcos, send for more men. And if Griffin comes before these men arrive? We'll do whatever we can, ma'am. Charlotte. Come on. Well, you know I ain't one to run from no fight. Nobody's gonna fight anybody. Tomorrow, first thing, we ride out of town, hide up in the hills somewhere. All of us? Maybe if Griffin rides through town... sees that it's already dead, he'll keep on going. I suggest you come with us. I can't go anywhere. My boy ran off and I need to go look for him. If you'll all excuse me... Damn Fletcher witch probably got the Paiutes to steal her horses back. No, that's not possible. - It was Frank Griffin. - Don't be an imbecile. Why would he steal our horses and leave? It was Valentine's boys stole the horses. - Pure and simple. - Why would they do that? He made a deal with us. Which is only good if there's a town of people left to deal with. Well, we can't all ride anywhere, not with only half a dozen mounts, we can't walk anywhere quick enough... so we're stuck here. How many rifles you got over at the jail? We got about three. Bill McNue took one of those. All right. All of you, get on home, get your hands on any weapons your husbands had, bring them to the jailhouse. What are you looking at her for? Go on! Where you been? Well, I had a paper to put out. - Did I miss anything? - Oh, you're just in time. But I expect you already knew that. I wrote a lovely piece about the ladies of La Belle. Now you're crying out of both eyes. Hey, now! Get the... He's got a map. Takes him all the way to California. It ain't the folks in La Belle I'm worried about. It's the folks near La Belle that give me pause. You ever hear of Blackdom? That little speck there is a town? More like a place. Why does it catch your eye? About ten, 12 years ago, you recall, we were down in Texas. We get chased by them slave soldiers, a whole regiment of blackies in Ranger uniforms. They was something. Them boys ran us all over the territory. They ran us out of the territory. That was them, huh? I fed and watered there on my way back down from Taos. - Oh, they're farmers now... - Mm. ...but they all gunned up like it's still the war. I would be, too, if I was them. But I wonder, why would they get in the middle of a shooting... that's got nothing to do with them? Couldn't say. But they might still be worth an eyeball. Boy, you cannot be this ignorant. Mr. Hobbs... I've been told that by so many folks for so long now, I've got to believe it's true. But here I am. Well, Louise ain't about. And even if she was, I wouldn't let you within ten feet of her. That's just fine... seeing as it's you and the other fellas I came to see. You're lucky they didn't shoot you. I thought for a minute they might. But you think they'll back us? They're thinking on it. And they was all soldiers. I mean, they can't just... They can't just watch us get slaughtered. Why not? I would, I was them. Not everyone's gonna be able to fight. And even if they could, we ain't got enough guns. What we do got ain't enough to take them out in the open. Which means we're gonna have to find a way to contain the fight. Contain it how? We can try and keep most of it off the streets. Get them off their horses and into someplace where we got the advantage. Have to be someplace they couldn't burn us out. Say someplace made of iron and brick. Go ahead, betray me! - Any of you got the guts? - Frank. I can shoot you dead. It's OK. It's just us. Roy? That's right, it's Roy. It's OK. It's OK. Oh, God. How y'all doing this evening? I know you, mister? We met. Fellas. We ain't much for people sneaking up on us in the dark. I'm just admiring your stock. You like them, do you? I do. Just as much as the first time I saw them in La Belle. How'd you fellas end up with them? The ladies sold them to us. Now, I wonder... why'd they do a thing like that, seeing as how bad they wanted them in the first place? I do know you. Boys... we got us a real celebrity in our midst. A right luminary. A big name. Big name. Why don't you come and sit with us, Mr. Roy Goode? Share our fire. Have a drink or two. I was never much for... spirits or... company. That's disappointing, but I understand. Well, Mr. Goode, it's all the same to you... you had best keep on moving. Go on. I'm gonna do just that. But first, I'm gonna cavvy up these animals... and take them back to La Belle. I'm gonna take your horse, too, friend. On account of you ain't fit to ride one. Mister... I don't think you savvy. In fact, you're a second away from getting dealt out of the game. - You've got nothing to say to that? - If you're gonna do it... Shit! Like I said... ...you ain't fit. Tell me, Mr. Goode, how are you planning on driving those horses all the way back to La Belle? Oh, don't you look at me, boys. I ain't help. So you just keep yourselves nice and still. They're already still. Are they? - How long you been sitting there? - Long enough. Now, Mr. Goode and I need to get moving... so we ask that you boys keep an eye on this herd for us until we get back. Y'all hear me? Horses are gonna have to wait. Now, I mean it. Y'all do as I say. What the hell did you do that for? Oh, just because I'm so damn mean. Now, y'all know who I am. So you all know I'll find you wherever you go, and I'll kill you. Just ask these two men rolling around in the dirt if I mean what I say. Now, I expect to find this herd fed... watered... groomed, hell, all pretty-looking, when I get back. Is that all right with you, fellas? - Yes, Mr. Goode. - Y-Yes, sir. Good. Come on. I've never even heard of this man. I feel like we've chased him some, once upon a time. I say we owe them folks nothing. Less than nothing. But how you gonna feel, you ride through there after they all been massacred? Not half as bad as I'll feel if y'all got massacred with them. Well, if the boy's right, we're talking about 30 men, half of them probably drunk or poorly trained. We've held off lots more with a lot fewer than that. I figure... in the morning, the two of us, along with Josiah and his pa, and Mr. Samuels and his two boys, and the Walkers, if they're up for it, we all ride out to La Belle to see if there's any fortifications we can help them with. You don't even know if this boy is telling the truth. - Whitey don't lie. - That you know of. Well, it took guts to come out here. I'll give the boy that much. Evening, sir. Folks. Oh, my. I see I've interrupted your supper. Forgive me, uh, but my sons... My sons and I were wondering if we might water our horses and purchase a few supplies from you all. Please, come in. Thank you. Are you hungry? Oh, we don't want to bother you, ma'am. Just some water for the horses. Maybe some jerky or hardtack if you've got any for purchase. Then we'll be on our way. Please, sit down. Keep an eye on them other houses. This looks mighty good. Been a while since we... sat at a proper table. If you don't mind, we like to say grace before our meals. Dear Lord, thank you for the food and fine company... and the door that was opened by these generous people. In God's name. Amen. Amen. Do you folks know, by chance, how far we might be from the town of La Belle? About an hour's ride or so. Hm. Are you a preacher? I am. I expect we've all in this room done our share of soldiering. Are the rest of your men outside? As I recall... you ran with quite a few. And is that a pistol I feel right now... pointed at me under the table? And these two boys of yours... they've got, what from I can tell... four more pistols between them... under their coats. Correct? You yourself, sir, I imagine are well-armed. As are you. And you. So it would appear we're sitting in a room full of men with pistols. It would appear so. I ain't got no quarrel with you folks. My business is in La Belle. Long as y'all just keep to yourselves, you'll all be just fine. So we keep being told. Where did them kids go? They didn't call that railroad "underground" for nothing. Don't. Enough! Enough. Have you no gun, sir? Goddamn it, sir. I had no quarrel with you. Hey, kids! Shh! Shh! Oh, no. No. Shh! OK, let's go. I didn't intend on coming back. I was heading up to California when I come upon a huge trail of horses. Got my curiosity, and that's when I come upon Logan and his bunch. California? To tell you the truth, I had me a feeling. I knew Frank was coming back. Sure it wasn't another kind of feeling brought you back? A lot of ways to California. - Are you talking about Alice? - I'm just talking. She ain't mine to have, Sheriff. Huh. - You see him? - The Indian gentleman? Jesus. I was beginning to think I was seeing things that weren't there. Oh, no, he's there, all right. Just he ain't exactly alive no more. I lived with him and his people for a time. A few months back, he and I tried to cross the San Juan... and it turns out he can't swim. I thought for sure he died. Are you telling me that's a ghost? And the dog? The dog went first. Anywhere with a clear shot of the street. Anywhere with a clear shot of the street. Head into the parlor. Why don't you go into the dining room? Hide in the dining room. Anywhere with a clear shot of the street. Anywhere with a clear shot of the street. You put yourself any place you want. Hey. What happened to that detective fella? Anywhere with a clear shot of the street. Anywhere with a clear shot of the street. Put yourself in the parlor. Anywhere with a clear shot of the street. They're in Blackdom. We've been riding around in circles, hiding all night, so as not to lead them here. If they're out there, they already know where we are. Put them kids with the others. I ain't no more of a kid than he is. I'm gonna stay here and fight with the rest of you. They killed all my family. I'm gonna kill each and every one of them before this day's over. I see why you like her. Truckee? Whoa. You open it like this. Load it like so. Excuse me. Why are you all still here? Valentine's boys stole our horses. You find your boy? I haven't seen him, but then I've been preoccupied some. I'm sorry. Alice? Your boy's probably safer wherever he is. And we could use someone who can handle a rifle without blowing their head off. Ain't nothing but pure-ass luck gonna save us now. "The calm..." before the storm." "Roughly... 30 armed..." "Roughly 100..." heavily... "armed men..." He ain't in here! Where is everybody? Up there. Hello, ladies! You goddamn bitch! I'm press! I'm press! I surrender! Whoo! Whoa! Look out! I'm so sorry, son. Martha! Martha! What in good holy hell? Frank. I ain't blind yet! Easy, sister. They only need to be killed but once. Where are my children? William! Trudy! It's all right, Papa. Griffin ain't here. It's my fault. I forgot about the trees. I'm sorry, son. You can't shoot him! Oh, I ain't gonna. He's your animal. I can't. He's in a lot of pain, son. You need to end his suffering. You'll be doing him a favor. I'm sorry. You done well. Tell me, son... have you got a pappy? Leave him be, Frank. He's a good boy. Reminds me of another when I first come upon him. Innocent. Full of promise. Truckee, you come on up here now. You best go on, son. Are you all right? There's a nice flat spot down here. I want you to get on my horse. I want you to ride straight home, all right? And don't turn back, either. Go on. You care about the boy. Pull your gun, Frank. That's gonna slow you down some. Come on, now. Let's just get this done. Same as it slowed you down up in Creede... and that box canyon. Pull your gun, Frank. I love you, too, son. No. No, I... No, I've seen my death. This ain't it. You seen wrong. Roy! Don't let that old witch light me on fire again. Whitey Winn was a sweet soul. Not all that bright, but... he was brave. He's with his ma and pa now, which, I suppose, is what he always wanted. He was a... He was a... Maggie, you knew the boy best. Maybe you ought to say a few words. Perhaps I might say a word or two. And who might you be? Pastor Garrett Moore. You're too late. I do hope not. "'Tis a fearful thing" to love what death can touch. A fearful thing to love, to hope, to dream, to be. To be, and, oh, to lose. A thing for fools, this. And a holy thing. A holy thing... to love. For your life has lived in me. Your laugh once lifted me. Your word was gift to me. To remember this brings painful joy. 'Tis a human thing, love. A holy thing... "to love what death has touched." Will I ever see you again? No, son. God bless you, Roy. You too, ma'am. Here. That's my mama's horse. I know. I'm leaving you the black one. He likes you better, anyway. Come here. "Iyovi." What does that mean in Paiute? - "Dove." - Like the bird? There's a post yonder still needs righting. Would you let her know for me? I found Ed Logan and his boys tied naked to an old oak not too far from town. The ladies' horses all grazing about. Any idea how that might have happened? Maybe talk to your sister about that one. Take good care of them. I aim to. I informed A.T. Grigg that Roy Goode and Frank Griffin killed each other in a gunfight outside La Belle. Be a hell of an obituary. Well, maybe I'll read it sometime. Good luck to you, Mr. Ward. -- English --
