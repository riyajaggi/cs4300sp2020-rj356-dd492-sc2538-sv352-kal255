 (MAN YELLING) (WAILING) (SHRIEKING) (DEVLINS PANTING) Easy there, fellas. (DEVLINS SHRIEKING) What y'all running away from? (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) I think they might be simple. I seen this one time before up in Nebraska. A pair like these two had their own kind of talk

 only the two of them could savvy. (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) FRANK: Boys. (MUMBLING GIBBERISH) FRANK: Boys! Where's your kin at? (FRANK SIGHS) These are your folks? Sister? FRANK: Who did this? (MUMBLING GIBBERISH) Can you boys talk English? Savages. They done it.

 Rode in to steal our food. They cut them up? And then they shot them? (SOBBING) They made us shoot them. (SOBBING CONTINUES) (DARYL SOBS) They made us... FRANK: All right. All right, boys. (SOBBING CONTINUES) GATZ: What do you think? Comanche? Kiowa, maybe? FLOYD: Maybe their spirits. Whoever done this didn't leave no tracks. I think it's more than likely this here "massacre"... was home-grown. What are we gonna tell him? He knows. (BUZZING) GATZ: Sometimes the folks you love... are the folks you hate. Especially when you're way the fuck out in the middle of nowhere. FRANK: Boys. I'd like you all to meet Donnie and Daryl Devlin. They're gonna be riding with us now. So, from here on, what's ours is theirs. (ECHOES) They're family. (INSTRUMENTAL THEME MUSIC PLAYS) (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSING) Oh, Mr. Grigg. I didn't expect you back... Get up off your lazy ass. We've got a special edition to put out. The fire at the feed store? Did you hear about that? I don't mean any damn fire. Not in this town, anyway. Come on, move. I want to get this issue out and get right back down to La Belle. What for? Because I want to be there when Frank Griffin comes riding in. - What? - Here. You start on these. I'll write the rest as we go. Is this true? I saw it with my own eyes. Did you warn them poor folks? Boy, you are slower than the second coming of Christ. Go! Excuse me, ma'am. I wonder if you might help me with something. It depends. I'm looking for this woman. And who might you be? Name's Webster. I'm with the Pinkerton Detective Agency in Chicago. Husband hire you? Mr. Bischoff's very concerned about his wife. I'm sure he is. I'm told she lives here now. - You just missed her. - What? She moved on. - Must be a week now. - Any idea where? Back to Germany is what I hear. Well, that's unfortunate... seeing as Mr. Bischoff had brought her down there to Mexico for her health. Mr. Bischoff sure sounds like a nice man. Go through the trouble and expense of hiring an armed detective to fetch his wife. He just wants her back, safe and sound. "Safe" is one of those funny words. Sometimes means something different to the person who says it and person who hears it. I don't follow. Maybe Mrs. Bischoff felt safer away from Mr. Bischoff... than with him. Well, maybe so, but she's still his wife, and, as such, it's not up to her. (SCOFFS) I didn't realize that "I do" meant, "You go right ahead, honey. Do as you please." She was going to take the Southern Pacific from Santa Fe to New York, get the boat from there. Train only runs but once a week, so if you ride hard, you can make it in a day... maybe catch her. Although, I doubt it. (KNOCKING) Come on, woman, open up. (KNOCKING CONTINUES) All right, you best keep yourself out of sight for a while. There's a man here from Pinkerton who wants to... MARTHA: Pinkerton? (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) Shh! You want to keep your voice down because the man's probably creeping about outside. (CHUCKLES) Oh. (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) I-I'd be scared to wear them, too. Ja. Beautiful, yes? Yeah. For you. Me? No, not for me. (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) Shit. Shit? (CHUCKLES) Shit! Shit. Well, why didn't she just say so? Oh! (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) Surprise. Your birthday. My birthday? Oh, come on! Well... how did she... I don't even know anymore when it's my damn birthday. (SCOFFS) That stupid... Stupid. (LAUGHS) (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) (LAUGHS) Shit! Oh, goddamn it. Let's all keep calm and talk about this like civilized folks. Sure. Come on in. Have a seat. I suggest we all first lower our weapons. After you. (CHUCKLES) Seems we're deadlocked. Seems so. Mrs. Bischoff... your husband... MARY-AGNES: Jesus. (WEBSTER GROANS) I'm not sure that was the best way to handle that situation. (GROANS) (MARTHA SPEAKS IN GERMAN) (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) I'm crippled! I doubt it. Shot went through and through. Missed the bone, looks like. Nice shooting. No, don't! (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) What are you doing? I don't care none what Otto says. I just had to see you for myself. That picture's been in my pocket for the better part of a year now. I'd look at your lovely face every night. You know, I think this fool may have some feelings for you. WEBSTER: Martha. (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) I can pretty well guess what that meant. What are you planning on doing with him? (GASPS) (WHIMPERS) MARTHA: Shh. (STOPS WHIMPERING) (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) Your voice is just like it was in my dreams. - I'll just be going now. - (MARTHA SPEAKS IN GERMAN) WEBSTER: That's it, just like that. Oh, God. Oh, God! Thank you, God. (THUNDER RUMBLES) (BANGING IN DISTANCE) (BANGING CONTINUES) ROY: "Mr. Roy Goode." C/O Lucy Cole. "Moses, New Mexico." "Jim Goode. Atascadero, California." (UNFOLDING LETTER) "Dear Roy..." LUCY: Roy Goode. Look at you. Come sit with me. Come on over. Right there. (DOOR OPENING) What's in the bag? Something for you. For me? (CHUCKLES) I told you I'd pay you back someday. It seems like y'all could use it. Sister? I knew you would make it all right. I knew the Lord would hear my prayers... and watch over you. Children. This is Mr. Goode. Now, he... he was once one of you. And now he is living proof that, with the help of God, we can all find our way. Tell us all about yourself, Roy. What's made you so successful? I don't rightly know. Now, you're being too modest. It's that light you've got inside. You can't deny it. Oh. I have something for you. Now, where did I put it? (DRAWER OPENING) (PAPERS RUSTLING) Oh, here it is. Thank you. Now, Roy Goode, don't you tell me someone as successful as you still can't read? Of course I can read. I-I have to admit, I was tempted many times over the years... to read it myself. (LUCY GRUNTS) See how your brother was doing. When did this come? Why... I can't tell you exactly. It was... It was so long ago. It was maybe a year or so after you left. - A year or so? - Yeah. A year or so. I'm very sorry. (SIGHS) I've got some folks waiting on me. Oh, of course. You've got your own people now. Roy? Good for you. (FOOTSTEPS) (PIANO PLAYING) Sit down. (FLOYD LAUGHS) (CHAIR SCRAPES) Where you been? Mr. Goode's... too good for us. (CHUCKLES) What's that? It ain't nothing that concerns you. Oh. If it ain't nothing... why are you cradling it so? I mean, you ain't even opened it yet. Let's have us a look. Right here, "Mr. Roy Goode." That's you. "C/O Lucy Cole." "Moses, New M..." It is Moses, right? Moses. And it's from Jim Goode. You must know him. "Ata..." "Atas..." "Atascadero, California." Let's see what's on the inside. AMOS: Oh. (PIANO STOPS PLAYING) ROY: Go on. Open it. I don't need your goddamn letter. (AMOS GRUNTS) Mr. High and Mighty's in one of his fucking moods again. Who the fuck do you think you... Roy! (FLOYD GRUNTS) Roy, come on! (FLOYD GROANS) (FLOYD GROANS) (FLOYD CRIES OUT) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) FRANK: Roy! (FRANK'S VOICE ECHOES) (DOOR CLATTERS) You can't go. Who else is gonna help around here? You don't need my help. You can take care of things just fine now. She needs you. Y'all are going to Boston. She always says that. We never go. Look, I'm sorry, kid. I thought I'd leave this with you. I don't want it. (CLATTERS) Goddamn you, Roy Goode! Goddamn you all the way to hell! (EXHALES) (SNIFFS) Are you mad at me, too? (FOOTSTEPS) TRUCKEE: Did you read it? I think he wants us to read it. Why else leave it? Well, if you ain't gonna... I will. (LETTER UNFOLDING) "Dear Roy. - I am sending..." - "Aren't" gonna. The man's got you talking just like him. I'll read it. "Dear Roy." I am sending this letter to Lucy in the hopes that someday it finds you. I am writing after all these years of absence... to tell you that I have never forgotten about you or my promise to you... but I wanted a life for you that you deserved. I've learned that life is a gift we are given, and that we should live it with honor and, God willing, leave something of our best selves behind. I know now that money matters only to the man with a small mind. The harder thing is to do the best one can with what one has. I learned these words and thoughts from reading... something I should have learned how to do a long time ago. Something I should have taught you, and maybe saved you some heartache. The truth is, books have taught me that I am not at all the man I could have been, but I want to try. I'm asking you to come now to the Atascadero territory in California and live with me and my wife. Yes, I got me a wife. I have a son, too. His name is Roy. He's but three. And you won't never believe the job I got... so I'm not even gonna bother telling you about it, unless I see you in person... which I'm hoping I will. I live near the Pacific Ocean, as I always said I would, and it is everything I always said it would be. I can't wait for you to see it. I don't think I have ever seen a body of water so big or so beautiful. They got fish in there the size of plow horses. And the water itself is the cleanest and clearest I have ever seen or touched. You look out and all you see is blue. Blue sky, blue water. It's overwhelming. You feel as if you're on the edge of something powerful. This place has changed me, and I do believe it will change you, too. I know I ain't been the brother you needed me to be. I know I ran off when you needed my protection. But I'm asking you now to come to Atascadero and give me a second chance. To let me teach you the things I should have taught you long ago. Take your time. I will always be here, waiting. "Your loving brother, Jim." TRUCKEE: Atascadero. Sounds nice. Think that's where he's headed? I hope so. (FIRE CRACKLING) In the absence of God... it's up to men like us to make the important decisions. For it's the ancient fears of loneliness, sickness and poverty that create men like us. FRANK: Very good. DARYL: The book says death ain't no big deal. (LAUGHS) - It's dying that's no goddamn fun. - FRANK: That's right. The man that lays down like a lamb... stays down. DONNIE: Only thing a man can truly count on is hisself. Amen. You rinse out that coffee pot before you started brewing? - I did. - Sure don't taste like it. Well, I did. Frank. That old arm of yours is getting pretty ripe. (FLIES BUZZING) Where the hell is La Belle? (BIRD CALLS) WOMAN: Morning, Whitey!
