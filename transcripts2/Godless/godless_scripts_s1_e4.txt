 [creaking] [creaking continues] [rubble crashing] What's all this, then? [creaking] [woman in mine] No! No! [crying out] [instrumental theme music plays] Seems me and you keep meeting in funeral parlors. The name's John Cook.

 He's from Santa Fe. You can send the body there. You just let Griffin ride into town? I did. And then I just let him ride on out. You take a shot at Frank Griffin and his men, you best kill 'em all. Something the poor folks at Creede learned, to their sad experience. Where's the army regiment that's supposed to be here? Wyoming. Up around Laramie. On range business. What was I supposed to do? Well, for starters... you can sober up.

 If you don't mind my asking, Sheriff, what all's your strategy, huh? I don't rightly know. I just want to get a rope around the man's neck before he does any more damage. Where's the marshal's badge? Where's his goddamn badge? [horse whinnies] Some places just got that dark look about them. [driver yells] [driver] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [indistinct chattering] [Gatz] What do you suppose they got inside that drum? Water. [driver yells] [yelling] [grunts] [flies buzzing] Sweet Jesus. [groaning] [Daryl] What the fuckity-fuck? Do not come in here. [woman] You best not linger yourself, Pastor. [old woman wheezes] What's your name, child? Lila. How long you been here, Lila? Well... I... brought my mama and papa here about a month ago. Then my sister, maybe a week later. Then I come. Your people all gone? So you're giving these folks comfort all on your own? Doctor can't keep up. And where be he? [man wheezing] [flies buzzing] - There a town nearby? - There was. All of them got the pox? Most everybody. We buried nine just last week. Sammy passed yesterday, but I don't got the strength to move him out. There was a little girl who came in two days ago with her mama, but... I can't find her now. Could you at least say a prayer for us before you go? I ain't leaving you, child. [sighs] [sniffs] I reckon maybe we should burn this place down. Put them poor folks out of their misery. Is that what you'd do, is it, son? It would be the Christian thing. Stop the pox before anybody else gets it. Why not just shoot them? Well, I'd probably do that first... so they don't feel no fire on them. [sighs] Take the boys ahead and make camp at the river. I'm gonna stay here a little while. You go back into that sick house, Frank, there's a good chance you don't come out. Don't worry none about me. - I ain't gonna die of no smallpox. - What if it's worse than that? Could be lepers in there. I ain't gonna die of no leprosy, neither. I already done seen what's gonna get me, and it ain't no sickness of any kind, so, go on now. I'll be back around suppertime. I could sure eat something. [grunts] Not you two. You two stay here with me. Gatz, take off that fucking badge. Howdy. Ma'am. [chickens clucking] Well... How y'all doing? My, oh, my. What can we do for you gentlemen? Just out here to pay our respects to... Corporal John Randall. We've heard tales. Had no idea you were so close. You're quite the legend, sir. That the only reason you come? Salute a war hero? No, sir. We came out here also to let you know that the La Belle claim has recently been bought out by the Quicksilver Mining Syndicate, and we're gonna be starting up again soon. Now, I know there's no love lost between you and the folks of La Belle. It was the mine poisoned our water. Only since it's been dead we got a chance to grow something out here. [chicken clucking] Just barely, I'd say. These rains been helping some. Rain is unpredictable. But the Quicksilver folks will be willing to divert some water from the La Belle River and give you all rights to it. At what cost? At the cost you just keep to yourselves. We've been doing just that. That you have, but one or two of them ladies might get it in their heads to come out here and ask for help. Maybe look for some brave men to back them up. Maybe offer to make them partners. We don't owe them folks nothing. We tell them the mine is poisoning our land, they don't do boo about it. Leave us to die out here. That's just who they are. And you best remember that, otherwise you could lose your land... be forced to move on. And that, sir, would be a damn shame after all your hard work. That a threat from the mining folks? That ain't no threat, it's a damn near guarantee. Statehood, it's coming. All sorts of new laws come along with it. Like they done in other places, some of them laws ain't gonna be as friendly to you all, war heroes or not. Now, I know I'm looking at free men. You fought for your country. You earned the right to be here, but not everyone sees it that way. But them Quicksilver folks do? Mister, I promise you, if you do as I say, just mind your own business... we'll look after you. Once again, it's a real honor, sir. Come on. Don't see why we gotta stay here... and risk getting ourselves eaten up by some horrible disease. It ain't fair. Maybe, if you hadn't opened your damn mouth about shooting them all... You don't think that's what he's gonna do? He's gonna let them think he's here to minister, but me and you both know, as soon as he gets tired of it, he's gonna "save" them. Pow! "I save you, sir." [both laugh] Pow! "I save you, ma'am." Pow! [laughs] "I save you all." Pow! Pow! "I save you all!" [Devlins laugh] [Devlins chatter and laugh] We can wash these folks for now, but we're gonna have to boil all their clothes. Blankets, too. [Donnie] Pow! [Devlins laugh] Excuse me. You should clean yourself as well. [door opening] [grunts] That's enough chopping. Let's get. I'm hungry. I need you to go down to that creek we passed, fill that up. Yes, sir. Then I need you to start digging some graves. Some of these folks ain't gonna last past supper. Speaking of supper... You can probably find some shovels in the barn. And if we don't find any? Use your hands. [gasps] I see you have stock out back and they don't look like they've been lately fed. I'll tend to them. If it's all right with you, I'll kill one or two of your chickens... [sniffs] ...so you can make a broth for these folks. - I'll help. - I can do it. You... Stay near the fire. Preacher. It's been a long time since anyone's shown any real kindness around here. [thunder rumbles] [Roy] A norther. Big one, looks like. It's getting late. Yes, ma'am. Good night, boy. You wear him out. Do you mind if, one of these days, I take him hunting? I'd only keep him out for a night or two. Just seems like a thing the boy should know how to do by now. I think he'd like that. [thunder rumbles] All right, then. Good night, ma'am. Good night. [Iyovi speaks in Paiute] Sweet dreams to you, too, Grandma. She's not here. Must be at my place. [thunder rumbles] I'll be right back. [Mary-Agnes] Whitey? Evening, Maggie. What are you traipsing around in the dark for? I was just going for a ride. Now? Yeah. Well, why not? I mean, you're out here, ain't you? Trudy forgot her dolly at my place. [thunder rumbles] Well, we best both get inside before the rain hits. Yeah. All right. Maggie. [thunder rumbles] [muffled scream] [light breathing] [gasps] [cries out] [panting] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [grunts] [blade slices] [panting] [whimpers] [whimpers] [gunshot echoes] [whimpers] You're gonna be all right now, ma'am. [Alice gasps] Bill? We have to get these people out of here. [mouths] [heavy rain falling] [distant thunder rumbles] [buzzing] [buzzing stops] They're moving south. But they keep to the river. [buzzing] So even with 30 horses, they will still be hard to follow. Bee tell you all that? Are you following me? No. You just happen to be heading my way? Stupid Indian. Filthy dog. Well... if you lose me, I'm heading south. But I'm sure a bee can tell you that. [thunder rumbles] That mud out there is absolutely... without bottom. [Grigg chuckles] By chance, is your livery man about? That would be me. [Grigg] Ah. Well, if you would be so kind. [chuckles] It's, uh, just outside there. [laughs] [bangs feet] A glass of beer, barkeep. [beer pouring] Phew! [thunder rumbles] [coin clatters] [glass sliding] To women, cards... and whiskey. The three war causes in the West. [sighs] My name is Grigg. And I'm here to inquire about your law. - Our law? - [Grigg] Mm. Seems the man's repute's been whispered all the way to Taos. Jesus Christ! A.T. Grigg? [chuckles] Sir, it is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Whitey Winn. Deputy Whitey Winn. I figured it was only a matter of time before you looked for me. In fact, I am not looking for you, son, and I would appreciate you taking a step back before whatever you've got gets communicable. I'm asking after Bill McNue. McNue? [Grigg] The first lawman ever to capture... the notorious Roy Goode. I don't know who you've been talking to, but... Bill McNue certainly didn't capture this man. Well, where is Sheriff McNue? Because I would still love to speak with him. Who knows where the man goes these days? [Grigg] Now, what do you mean, sir? [Asa] He's a coward. And you can print that Asa Leopold said such. Perhaps one of you... can make sense of this. [slides paper] "To Marshal John Cook. Have R.G. in custody in La Belle. Will meet up in Olegrande." Signed, "Bill McNue." [slides paper] Sir, I smell a rodent. Someone is trying to fool you. Well, it wouldn't be the first time. Well, so that my trip is not a total loss, why don't you all tell me about this part of the world I just rode into? [chuckles] You can start by explaining where the hell everybody went. Mine took them. Eighty-three in one go. All of them? Present company excepted. Huh. Well... then aside from you fine gentlemen, who all is left? Just the women. Really? Just the women? [thunder rumbles] [pencil scratching] - How are we supposed to hunt in the rain? - It's just water. You ain't gonna melt. And it will be gone by noon. All the game will be out by then, taking in the sunshine, waiting on us. Waiting on us to kill them? That's the basic idea of hunting. There's lunch in there. Probably enough for dinner, too. Oh, thank you, ma'am. [thunder rumbles] How would you boys feel about having some company? It would be just fine. Wonderful. [horse nickers] Iyovi. [Iyovi speaks in Paiute] [Alice] She hasn't been on a proper hunt in I don't know how long. I think it might do her some good. Also, gives me some peace and quiet. Good luck, now. [whistles] I think she wants to get going. Yeah, I got that. [Iyovi singing in Paiute] [singing stops] [singing resumes] What the hell is Granny going on about back there? She's singing her hunting song. Well, she's gonna scare away all the damn game. [singing continues] [Roy] I think we head up onto that ridge and keep ourselves up-sun and downwind from whatever's hiding below. Or we can go that way. [grunts] [Roy clears throat] Just look at him. Aim for just above the front flank, here. That's where the heart is. We don't want to go traipsing through the woods after a wounded animal. Now, take a breath and hold it. That's it. Now, when you're ready... just pull the trigger, real slow. [buck snorts] Better do it now, boy. [Iyovi mutters in Paiute] Maybe we should try some fishing. [water gushing] There's a nice pool over there by them boulders. Looks like it gets deep pretty quick, so better stay behind me. Wait. Looks like they tried to cross too soon after the melt. Thought they would try it here where it wasn't as wide, but... But they was wrong. [Iyovi shrieks] Interesting woman... your granny. Throw me my book, will you? Someone made that for me when I weren't much older than you. [Truckee] Show me tricks? I don't know any tricks. I saw you shoot that snake. That weren't no trick. I wasn't thinking then, I was just doing. World don't need another gunfighter. [sings in Paiute] [singing continues] [singing continues] [boy] There was a train robber, once upon a time... named big Black Jack Ketchum. [boy] He was a giant fella. Had to go nearly seven feet and some 300 pounds. He was so big, the hangman had to build an extra-tall scaffold to make sure his feet didn't hit the ground when they dropped him. And when Black Jack dropped, that extra few feet was just enough to jerk his damn head right off his shoulders. It rolled right onto the platform, a big grin still on his face. Something I ain't never gonna forget. [bird hoots] And now I ain't, neither. [twigs snapping] Stop right there, fucker! Come any closer and I'll blast your goddamn fucking face! And he'll fucking do it, too, you stupid son of a whore! [woman] Don't shoot! - Well, now. - [older boy] I-I'm sorry, ma'am. We thought you were some sort of jackal or criminal type, come to take advantage. Well, you were right to think that. It can be rather dangerous around here. My name is Lucy Cole. And what do I call you two? I'm Jim Goode, and this is my brother, Roy. I think he's a little astonished. As am I! From that impressive burst of top-quality cussing, I thought for sure I'd be face to face with a pair of deviant lowlifes. Do you mind telling me what you two gentlemen are doing out here? We're on our way to California. Are you, now? Yes, ma'am. We're gonna start a ranch out there. Where are you coming from? Moses, New Mexico. Oh, I know where Moses is. It's right next to Old Moses. Sweet little town. In fact, I live there. Or, should I say, here. - I told you we was going in a circle. - It was dark! How was I supposed to know? Forgive me for saying so, but... aren't you two traveling rather light for such a long journey? W-We're just getting started. Yeah, I see. Are you on foot, ma'am? Please, call me Sister Lucy. And though I do possess a wagon and a beast to pull it, tonight, when we saw your fire, we didn't see fit to hitch it, seeing as how you two were so close by. "We"? [bird hoots] [whistle] Everyone... these two fine gentlemen are Roy and Jim, and they're gonna be joining us for supper. And maybe... if we're nice enough, they will stay for breakfast. [Iyovi singing in Paiute] [singing continues] [flies buzzing] Good shooting. [singing continues] Hi, Mary-Agnes. Beautiful day, isn't it? Whitey? You in there? Brought you breakfast. [wind howling] [sighs] [laughter and chattering] - How are them eggs? - Delicious. Anybody want another biscuit? - Oh, yes, please. - [man] Yes, ma'am. I'm looking for Whitey. Hm? - The damn deputy. - [Logan] Oh. We ain't seen the boy around. But then, we ain't really had no use for him, neither. Come here, pretty thing. [Logan] You're as light as a feather. Mm. Where are you going? I got chores at home. [Logan] Let a man help you with some of them chores. You all seem to have made yourselves right at home. That was the arrangement, wasn't it? [woman laughs] [Callie] Come on, then. [whistling and laughter] Where have you been? Busy looking after Bill's kids. [women laughing] You want me to come over tonight, keep you company? Uh... I don't think Bill would feel so good about us being in his place. Never stopped you before. I got to be going. Whitey's gone missing. What are you mad at? I'm not mad. What are you, then? Look, you want company? Go spend some time with your little Fritz bitch. What is it you think you know? It's not what I think I know. It's what I seen. [girl] Miss Dunne? The students are in their seats. [Callie] Be right there, sweetie. - I guess I've been caught out, then. - I'd say so. Although, I should have expected it... given what you are. Your pupils are waiting on you. I could sure use a pretty hairbrush like that one. You know, it's been a long time since somebody bought me a gift. - You deserve it. - Any of you seen Whitey? [Asa] Who knows where he is? That boy just comes and goes as he pleases. Asa? Or maybe one or two of these sweet little clips. Good morning to you... ma'am. [chuckles] My goodness. Good morning, sir. [Sarah] Mr. Grigg. Hello. I would love... some of your finest tobacco. And some of that delicious licorice right there. Oh. And one of those lovely-looking blankets. Hotel bedding is just a little bit thin. [Sarah chuckles] Say, could I ask you... how long have you lived here, sir? Since right after they brought up the first ore, 12 years ago. My, my. I bet you could tell some stories. Oh, I could tell a few. Well, I would love to buy you a glass of beer and have a chat. - I like beer. - Good! I can't figure out how someone with such delicate ears can tolerate such a racket. - [laughs] Delicate ears? - I a'thought you'd want to protect 'em. [bell clanging] Owing to how musical they are. [scoffs] Oh. It ain't my ears that are musical, it's my hands. They just do what they want to do. [sighs] You need a bath. - Yeah, I keep hearing that. - Huh. Best you heed it, you ever gonna seduce me. Excuse me? Oh, I know your type, Whitey. - My type? - Mm. A boy like you is liable to get a girl in the usual fix and then bolt. Yeah, well, that's me in a nutshell. [bell clanging] You still haven't told me what that damn bell's for. Old Samson is blind. Sometimes he goes wandering off in the nighttime. He don't wear that bell, we can't ever find him. You got a blind mule? Uh-huh. They keep the mules down in the mine for a whole year and never bring them up. They live there, down there in the dark. Then they bring them up, put a few layers of cloth over their eyes until they get used to the light. A lot of them went blind. Couldn't take the sun. Samson's one of those. So my daddy got him real cheap. Say... you ain't so bad-looking, you know. Thank you. Well, neither are you. So bad-looking, I mean. How was that? It was pretty much like I imagined it. Maybe better. So you've been imagining it? [giggles] Take off your britches. Excuse me? I'm gonna give you a bath. - [scoffs] No, you ain't. - Oh, yes, I am. [Louise laughs] [Louise shrieks] [Randall] Louise! Both of you, get on out of there. [bell clanging] Son, you best be on your way now. - Sir I... - Daddy... You don't want to be speaking right now. And you want to be getting on your way. I see you back here... it ain't gonna be you I lay a hand on, understand? Yes, sir. [Louise shrieking] [Randall yelling] [Randall] If I ever, ever... [shrieking and yelling] Oh, no, sir. [shrieking continues] No, sir. [rifle cocking] [shrieking and yelling] [Randall yells] [Louise shrieking] [horse whinnies] [yelling continues] Are you all right, son? Oh, just resting. [Randall grunting] [Louise sobs] We were just heading back in. Oh, me, too. Why don't you ride along with us? [wind whistling] [creaking] [horse whinnies] The woman shot a rimfire slug into the eye of a buck. Probably 100 yards out. That's something. [speaks in Paiute] [speaks in Paiute] What did she say? She said she was aiming for the other eye. I should probably be getting back before that Logan fella moves into my house. You hardly ate anything. Would you like to take some home with you for later? Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. Thank you, though. Good night, all. You saw what was really going on out there. I would have surely made quite a mess for myself if you hadn't come along. Oh, well... who's to say? A newspaperman from Taos rode into town yesterday. A fella by the name of Grigg. Now, he had it in his head that Bill McNue had captured Roy Goode. What all gave him that idea? I don't know. But he brought with him a wanted poster and passed it around. Did he? It was a funny likeness. Nobody in town ever seen him before, though. Nobody? Well... nobody in that saloon, that is. And I ain't never seen him, neither. That man looked angry. He looked fierce. He's not at all the kind of man that would stop a young fella from hurting hisself. Looked like he'd be the one doing the hurting. [door opening] Thank you again, Miss Fletcher, for that fine meal. You're most welcome. And, uh... And thank you, too... Mr. Ward. Sounds like you had quite a trip. Oh, it was. Anyway, I'd best get me some sleep now. That old woman wore me out. Good night, then. Good night. [Lucy] I'm so proud of you, Roy. [Lucy] You've been a big help to me these last few months. - I like it here. - I'm glad to hear it. You know, you're welcome to stay with us for as long as you like. Roy? Where are we going? California? - I'll get a blanket and come with you. - You ain't going nowhere. You're gonna stay here in Moses and wait for me to come back. Like hell I will! I'm coming with you. Roy, now, you listen to your brother. He means what's best for you. You can't leave me here! Go on, then. Now, you wait for me right here. I'll be back as soon as I get work. Promise. You don't go nowhere, understand? You stay right here with Sister Lucy and wait for me to come back. OK, little brother? You go on, then. [grunts] [mutters] For crying out loud! [buzzing] Afternoon, mister. [McNue] Afternoon. You're as quiet as a clerk over there. Well, I didn't hear you, neither. Well, now, who can blame us for picking the same beautiful spot? You catch a chill? [McNue] I beg your pardon? You got that coat bunched up like it's Christmas. Yeah, well... it's because I'm hiding a big rifle. [chuckling] Where you headed? I was thinking about exploring Wyoming. Trying my luck on one of them big spreads up there. Are you a hand? Foreman. [Bill Chick] Well, Mr. Foreman, I hope you're better at ranching than you are exploring. Heading in the wrong direction. Am I? Wyoming's, uh... that way, isn't it? Is it? Well, that sure does explain a whole lot. Afternoon. Afternoon. Are you the gent that's been following us? Well, if that is so, it ain't on purpose. Do we know each other, sir? I don't think so. What's your name? Is something wrong? I'm just wondering. What about? What it was, took the life out of your face. Was it just the weather... like most men who live out this way? Or was it maybe... things you've seen? Well, that's a... I think you're not what you say you are. I think you're harder than you're letting on. Why would you hide yourself like that? Well, for starters, I'm amongst 30 hard men. Is Floyd right? Are you following me? I am. You the law? While I admire your ginger, sir, sometimes men want me to kill them... so they can die attached to some purpose. Is that what you want? You want me to kill you? Turn you into a bedtime story? I'd prefer to kill you first. You won't kill me, friend. Not today, I won't. Not ever. I've seen how it happens. Ain't gonna be the law that blows out my spark. If you say so. I know so. And now you do, too. [horse snorts] Good luck to you, sir. ♪ Well, I lived by the Good Book ♪ ♪ With God in my ears ♪ ♪ And I followed his will ♪ ♪ For all my years ♪ ♪ Then you ♪ ♪ Then you ♪ ♪ How did I find myself ♪ ♪ Here? ♪ ♪ How did I find myself ♪ ♪ Here? ♪
