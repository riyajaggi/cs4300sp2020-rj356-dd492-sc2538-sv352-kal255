 AS AN INTERVIEWER, THE TRUTH FLOWS. LIES, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER. HOW CAN YOU MURDER SOMEONE WHEN YOU KNOW THAT HIS DAUGHTERS ARE GONNA BE HOME FROM SCHOOL? THAT'S THE EPITOME OF EVIL. THE HOUSE THAT I LIVED IN WITH MY SISTER AND MY DAD WAS... IT WAS NOTHING FANCY, BUT IT WAS OUR HOME. IT HAD EVERYTHING IT NEEDED, WHICH WAS MY SISTER, JAMIE, AND MY DAD AND EACH OTHER'S COMPANY. SISTERS JAMIE AND NICOLE LIVE WITH THEIR 39-YEAR-OLD FATHER,

 JOHN RIEBE. HEY, GIRLS. HE WAS VERY WARMHEARTED AND CARING PERSON. I'D GET OFF THE SCHOOL BUS, AND MY DAD WOULD JUST BE STANDING IN THE FRONT YARD WITH THE FOOTBALL. AND WE'D SPEND HOURS JUST THROWING IT BACK AND FORTH. GREAT ONE! WE DID HAVE A VERY HAPPY CHILDHOOD. IT WAS VERY NICE HAVING THE BIG BACKYARD AND BEING ABLE TO BE OUTSIDE AND NOT COOPED UP OR ANYTHING. MY SISTER AND I ARE REALLY CLOSE IN AGE. SHE IS ABOUT 15 MONTHS OLDER THAN I AM, SO WE HAD THIS SISTER KIND OF RIVALRY AT HOME. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE ALL SISTERS FIGHT,

 STEALING EACH OTHER'S CLOTHES, BUT WE'RE VERY CLOSE. SHE'S ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS. JOHN HAS BEEN LOOKING AFTER THE GIRLS AS THEIR PRIMARY CARER EVER SINCE THEIR MOM, LISA, LEFT 10 YEARS AGO. MY MOM AND DAD HAD MY SISTER, JAMIE, PRETTY QUICKLY INTO THEIR MARRIAGE, AND SHORTLY AFTER, I FOLLOWED, AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY WERE READY, YOU KNOW, TO BE THOSE ADULTS YET, AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE CLASHING BETWEEN THE TWO CAME INTO PLAY. HE JUST ENDED UP HAVING TO RAISE TWO KIDS BY HIMSELF. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY IT TAKES A VILLAGE, AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE HAD. WE HAD A VILLAGE OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WERE ALWAYS THERE TO HELP AND SUPPORT US, TO HELP AND SUPPORT MY DAD AND MY SISTER AND ME. ME AND MY MOTHER AND LISA'S MOTHER WERE SURROGATE PARENTS. AND IT WAS FUN FOR US. IT WAS FUN. GROWING UP, MY MOM LIVED ABOUT 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM US, SO SHE WASN'T TOO FAR. IT'S NOT THAT BAD. MOM! AND SHE STILL STAYED INVOLVED WITH US AND WAS THERE FOR US WHEN WE NEEDED HER. HEY, GIRLS. MY PARENTS TRIED TO DO A GOOD JOB OF KEEPING THEIR CONFLICTS AND ISSUES IN THE BACKGROUND, SO IT DIDN'T SEEP TOO MUCH INTO THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH JAMIE AND ME. NEIGHBORHOOD'S STARTING TO LOOK NICE. IT'S GETTING COLDER. CHRISTMAS IN THE RIEBE HOUSEHOLD WAS A HUGE EVENT. WELL, WE'LL START GETTING OUR DECORATIONS UP TOMORROW. MY DAD ALWAYS HAD TO GO GET... WE DIDN'T HAVE A BIG HOUSE, BUT FOR SOME REASON, HE ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE A HUGE TREE, HUGE TREE. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET THE TREE? TOMORROW. WE'LL GET A GOOD-SIZED ONE. OUR LIVING ROOM WASN'T THAT BIG, BUT... SO, I MEAN, THE CHRISTMAS TREE WOULD TAKE UP HALF OF OUR LIVING ROOM. YEAH, JUST MAKE SURE IT FITS IN THE HOUSE THIS TIME. HEY! HE ALWAYS TRIED TO MAKE SURE WE ALWAYS GOT WHAT WE WANTED. CHRISTMAS WAS ALWAYS AMAZING AT OUR HOUSE. DECEMBER 15th WAS A VERY COLD DAY. I WAS RIDING THE SCHOOL BUS HOME, AND I HAD MY HEAD LEANING AGAINST THE WINDOW, AND THE WINDOW WAS ICY. IT WAS JUST FREEZING COLD, WHICH IS A STRANGE DETAIL TO REMEMBER, BUT WITH THOSE SORTS OF DAYS, YOU KIND OF REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS. WE WALKED UP THE STEPS TO OUR DECK TO OUR FRONT DOOR. AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED... - DAD? - WHAT'S GOING ON? ...WHICH WE WERE OBVIOUSLY CONFUSED ABOUT BECAUSE THE CAR'S IN THE DRIVEWAY SHOWED THAT MY DAD SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOME. - DAD? - DAD! HE NEVER LOCKS THE DOOR. I DON'T HAVE MY KEY TODAY. OF COURSE I LEAVE MY KEY AT HOME 90% OF THE TIME. DOOR'S LOCKED. OKAY, MAYBE HE'S IN THE BATHROOM. WE'LL TRY THE BACK DOOR. DAD? DAD? STILL NO ANSWER. OKAY, WE CAN'T GET IN. WE HAD A WINDOW ON OUR DOOR, AND I STARTED TRYING TO PEER THROUGH, AND I COULD SEE THE COUCH AND THE COFFEE TABLE, AND IN BETWEEN THE COUCH AND COFFEE TABLE... DAD? ...I SAW MY DAD LYING FACEDOWN IN THE FLOOR. JAMIE, I CAN SEE HIS FEET ON THE FLOOR. HE'S ON THE FLOOR. HOLD IT. HOLD THE WINDOW. I CRAWLED THROUGH THE WINDOW, AND I UNLOCKED THE DOOR, GOT MY SISTER IN. I WALKED OVER TO MY DAD'S BODY. THERE WAS A GUITAR LAYING ON TOP OF HIM. I TOUCHED HIS BACK, AND I FELT THAT HE WAS WARM. I GRABBED THE PHONE, AND, UM... I HAD CALLED... TRIED TO CALL 911. HELLO? OF COURSE THEY'RE ASKING, "WELL, IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE?" I SAID, "NO, MY SISTER AND I JUST GOT HOME FROM SCHOOL." AND HE GOES, "OKAY, WELL, YOU NEED TO ROLL HIM OVER." AND HE WAS BLUE. THE PERSON ON THE 911 CALL TOLD HER THAT WE SHOULD GO WAIT OUTSIDE. AND I WISH I HAD DONE THE SAME. BUT I LOOKED AT MY DAD, AND I LOOKED AT HIS FACE, AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS DEAD. AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW A PUDDLE OF BLOOD NEXT TO HIM. AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE KILLED HIMSELF. AND THEN I RAN OUTSIDE AND JOINED MY SISTER, AND WE BOTH STOOD OUT THERE SCREAMING. WE WERE SAYING THINGS LIKE, "WHY WOULD HE DO THIS? WHY WOULD HE LEAVE US? WHY WOULD HE LEAVE US?" DETECTIVES BOB COLWELL AND TODD SLAMAN ARE CALLED TO THE SCENE. IT WAS CHRISTMAS WEEK, AND I WAS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING WITH MY FAMILY WHEN I RECEIVED THE CALL FROM SERGEANT CALDWELL. YOU HAVE ONE SHOT AT A CRIME SCENE, AND THEN IT'S DESTROYED FOREVER. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN BRING BACK. WHEN WE FIRST GOT TO THE CRIME SCENE, I SAW THE VICTIM, WHO WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR ON THE BACK CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM. FROM THE CONDITION OF THE BODY, YOU SEE THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN DEAD LONG, AND IT WAS MAYBE A MATTER OF 30 MINUTES. I COULD SEE ON THE FLOOR THAT THERE WAS SPENT CASINGS. IT WAS CLEAR IT WAS NOT A SUICIDE. YOU COULD DEFINITELY TELL AT THAT POINT IN TIME SOMEONE HAD SHOT AT HIM. THE GUITAR WAS LAYING NEXT TO HIS BODY. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE SHOT HIM AS HE WAS PLAYING THE GUITAR. WORD OF JOHN'S DEATH SPREADS, AND THE RIEBE FAMILY BEGIN TO GATHER IN SUPPORT OF JAMIE AND NICOLE. JUST UNBELIEVABLE. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? IT'S JUST A SAD DAY. WE CALLED THE PLACE WHERE MY MOM AND GRANDMA WORKED. AND SHE GOT THERE AS FAST AS SHE COULD. JAMIE! MOM! THE FORENSICS TEAM CONTINUE TO COMB THE SCENE FOR CLUES. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FORCED ENTRY, SO WHOEVER THE PERPETRATOR WAS AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, EITHER JOHN LET HIM IN, OR HE LET HIMSELF IN. HE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH JOHN. HE HAD BEEN SHOT SEVEN TIMES. THE ONE WOUND THAT WAS FATAL WAS HE SHOT RIGHT IN THE AORTA, JUST RIGHT DEAD CENTER MASS. THE NUMBER OF GUNSHOTS INDICATE IT WAS A KILLING FUELED BY ANGER. SOMEBODY WAS PISSED OFF AT HIM. SOMETHING AT THAT MOMENT TRIGGERED SOMETHING SO CATASTROPHIC IN THE PERPETRATOR THAT HE RESULTED TO TAKING OUT AND ELIMINATING JOHN. WE TOOK NICOLE AND JAMIE AND, I BELIEVE, LISA NEXT DOOR TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO LET US USE KIND OF LIKE A QUIET HOUSE. WELL, WE WERE COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL. DETECTIVE SLAMAN SEPARATES THE GIRLS AND THEIR MOTHER AND INTERVIEWS THEM ONE-BY-ONE. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSEST TO YOUR VICTIM ARE DEFINITELY PEOPLE YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE THEM RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. LISA, WELL, WE LEARNED THAT THERE WERE SOME MARITAL DIFFICULTIES DATING BACK OVER 10 YEARS, YOU KNOW? THEY HAD A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAD SOME UPS AND DOWNS. LISA WAS A LITTLE BIT PARANOID. SHE DIDN'T TRUST A LOT OF PEOPLE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. WHAT AM I THINKING? WELL, I'M THE EX, RIGHT? OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA THINK IT WAS ME. FATHER OF TWO, JOHN RIEBE, HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD, AND POLICE ARE QUESTIONING HIS ESTRANGED WIFE, LISA RICHMAN. WELL, I'M THE EX, RIGHT? OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA THINK IT WAS ME. SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE THAT WE WERE DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN AND, YOU KNOW, NEEDED TO SEE IF SHE WAS INVOLVED. LISA TELLS DETECTIVES SHE SPENT ALL DAY AT WORK. UNTIL POLICE CAN VERIFY LISA'S ALIBI, THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER HER A POSSIBLE PERSON OF INTEREST. BY 11:30 OR 12:00 THAT NIGHT, I WAS JUST FINISHING UP THE CRIME SCENE, AND A COUPLE OF JOHN'S FRIENDS SHOWED UP. THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY UPSET. THEY HAD SAW THAT JOHN RIEBE HAD BEEN KILLED. THEY HAD SAW IT ON THE NEWS. THEY SAID THEY HAD INFORMATION THAT COULD POSSIBLY LEAD TO WHOEVER KILLED HIM. POLICE BRING THEM TO THE STATION TO BE INTERVIEWED. WELL, THE BEST PART OF THIS JOB IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE REAL TRUTH IS. AFTER SO MANY YEARS, YOU START REALLY GETTING A FEEL IF THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH OR THEY'RE LYING TO YOU. KLAWITTER WAS ADVISING US THAT JOHN WAS AN EASYGOING GUY. HE LIKED TO WORK. HE LIKED TO PARTY. KLAWITTER TELLS POLICE THAT HE'D BEEN AT A PARTY AT JOHN RIEBE'S HOUSE THE PREVIOUS FRIDAY... ...WHEN A MAN CAME IN THAT KLAWITTER DIDN'T RECOGNIZE. HE SAID, WHEN THE GUY WAS LEAVING, HE WALKED OUT INTO THE LIVING ROOM NOW, AND HE ACTUALLY CONFRONTED THEM. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? WHY YOU KEEP LOOKING AT ME? HE WATCHED ME WHEN I CAME IN, AND THEY'RE WATCHING ME NOW. NEXT, THE DETECTIVES SPEAK WITH JOHN'S BEST FRIEND, ERIC BABOS. ERIC BABOS WAS A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'D GONE TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER. HE HAD KNOWN JOHN RIEBE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ERIC AND MY DAD HAD A TIGHT FRIENDSHIP. YOU KNOW, WHENEVER ERIC NEEDED SOME EXTRA MONEY, MY DAD WOULD ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO HAVE HIM HELP OUT WITH SOME JOBS AS HIS ASSISTANT. BABOS CORROBORATES KLAWITTER'S ACCOUNT OF THE PARTY. WE NEEDED TO DEFINITELY DIG INTO A LOT DEEPER AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHO THIS GUY WAS. BUT WITH ONLY AN ALIAS AND A VAGUE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION, IDENTIFYING J.R. ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY. WE START SENDING THE SUBPOENAS OUT FOR THE PHONE RECORDS. WE START GATHERING ALL THE INFORMATION, FOLLOWING UP ON THE CORONER'S REPORT, FOLLOWING UP ON DIFFERENT AVENUES. WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM LISA'S ALIBI. SHE WAS ELIMINATED WITH THE PHONE RECORDS, AND HER EMPLOYER ADVISING THAT SHE WAS AT WORK DURING THE TIME FRAME. BOB, YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO SEE THIS. JOHN RIEBE'S CELLPHONE RECORDS OFFER THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT CLUE. WHAT AM I LOOKING AT? VALYNN RODGERS. WE WERE ABLE TO PINPOINT THAT NUMBER AS A NUMBER THAT HE CALLED FREQUENTLY, SO WE HAD THE NAME VALYNN RODGERS. WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS IN CUSTODY ON SOME MINOR CHARGES. CHECK HIS STREET NAME. - J.R. - YEAH. BOB, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS. POLICE HAVE TRACKED DOWN VALYNN RODGERS, THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THE KILLING OF JOHN RIEBE. OKAY, LET'S CHECK HIM OUT. RODGERS IS ALREADY IN CUSTODY FOR AN UNRELATED CRIME. AND HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BULLPEN WITH THE OTHER PRISONERS, AND WE ACTUALLY WENT THERE THAT DAY, PULLED HIM ASIDE AND JUST, YOU KNOW, ADVISED HIM WE WANTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT JOHN RIEBE. YEAH. I KNOW JOHN. WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? HE'S DEAD. HE'S BEEN MURDERED. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS. LOOK, ALL RIGHT. I RAN ERRANDS FOR HIM. HE'D CALL ME. I'D DELIVER BOOZE. I'D DELIVER DOPE. THE POLICE ALREADY KNEW JOHN RIEBE LIKED TO PARTY. NOW THEY KNOW RODGERS SUPPLIED HIM WITH DRUGS. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT MY GRANDMA'S DURING THE WEEKEND, AND THAT'S WHEN A LOT OF THAT SORT OF THING WOULD HAPPEN. SO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE WORK ALL WEEK AND PARTY ON THE WEEKENDS KIND OF THING. HE WAS GOOD CUSTOMER. JOHN WAS A GOOD GUY. HE WAS A NICE GUY. ALWAYS PAID UP FRONT, ALWAYS HAD THE MONEY. I'M NOT GONNA KILL MY BEST CUSTOMER, AM I? BASICALLY, VALYNN RODGERS SAID, "HEY, LOOK, THIS GUY WAS THE GOLDEN GOOSE. WHY WOULD I KILL HIM? IN 15 MINUTES, I MAKE A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS OFF THIS GUY." RODGERS ADMITS BEING AT THE PARTY THE PREVIOUS FRIDAY, WHERE HE MADE A DELIVERY TO JOHN. HIM AND JOHN DID THE DEAL IN THERE, AND THEN WHEN HE WENT OUT, HE BECAME FOCUSED ON A GIRL. WE TALKED. I GOT HER NUMBER, AND THAT WAS IT, AND I LEFT. RODGERS PROVIDES DETECTIVES WITH THE NAME OF THE WOMAN HE SPOKE TO THAT NIGHT... MICHELLE ARRIAGA. WITH OPPOSING ACCOUNTS OF THE PARTY, THE DETECTIVES NEED TO TRACK DOWN THE FINAL WITNESS FROM THAT EVENING. YOU HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO JOHN RIEBE? YEAH, I HEARD. MICHELLE TOLD US THAT J.R., ON HIS WAY OUT, HE WAS TRYING TO GET A DATE WITH HER, NOT CONCERNED WITH THESE OTHER KNUCKLEHEADS THAT WERE IN THE ROOM. THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFLICTING STORIES ABOUT THE PARTY. THERE WAS NO GUN? - NOT THAT I REMEMBER AT ALL. - NO? MICHELLE'S ACCOUNT THROWS ERIC BABOS' AND JOHN KLAWITTER'S TESTIMONY INTO QUESTION. AS POLICE SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH, THE GIRLS STRUGGLE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR LOSS. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US SLEPT. I JUST REMEMBER CRYING THE WHOLE NIGHT, AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE THE NEXT DAY, IT WAS LIKE IT WAS HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN. MY SISTER AND I, WE STAYED CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT BOTH OF US NEEDED, BUT NEITHER OF US HAD ANY IDEA WHAT TO SAY TO THE OTHER ONE. WHILE THE GIRLS TRIED TO COPE WITH THEIR GRIEF... HAVE A SEAT OVER THERE, WOULD YOU PLEASE, LISA? ...THEIR MOM, LISA, STUMBLES ACROSS SOMETHING SHE THINKS COULD BE VITAL TO THE CASE. AS SOON AS I HEARD THESE, I HAD TO COME TO YOU GUYS. I KNOW THEY'RE IMPORTANT. SHE CLAIMS SHE HAS JUST DISCOVERED SOME VOICEMAILS LEFT THE DAY OF JOHN'S MURDER. SHE CHECKED HER PHONE, AND THAT'S WHEN SHE FOUND OUT, "JUST MINUTES BEFORE 3:00, MY EX-HUSBAND IS ALIVE AND CALLING ME." AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, JOHN'S VOICE CAME ON THERE, AND I JUST... I COULDN'T BREATHE. I THINK I WENT INTO SHOCK, UM, KNOWING HE WAS TRYING TO REACH OUT, TRYING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, "HEY, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE," AND I COULDN'T GET TO THE PHONE BECAUSE I WAS AT WORK. IT'S A VOICEMAIL FROM JOHN ASKING LISA TO PICK UP HIS PAYCHECK. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE. LIKE HE'D BE OUT ON A JOB OR SOMETHING, COULDN'T GET BACK TO THE SHOP. "HEY, CAN YOU GO PICK THAT UP FOR ME?" "YEAH, NO PROBLEM." AND YOU SAY THERE'S A SECOND RECORDING? YEAH, THERE'S ONE MORE. THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE ROOM THERE WITH HIM. LISTEN AGAIN. DID YOU HEAR IT? THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMEONE IN THE BACKGROUND. YEAH. IT SEEMS JOHN'S KILLER HAS BEEN CAUGHT ON THE VOICEMAIL MESSAGE. THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK DONE ON IT TO SEE IF THAT VOICE COULD BE MADE OUT. THE TECHNOLOGY COULD NOT MAKE IT DISCERNIBLE WHAT THEY SAID OR WHAT THEIR VOICE EVEN SOUNDED LIKE. BUT THE VOICEMAILS STILL HOLD VITAL INFORMATION FOR THE DETECTIVES. WE KNOW JOHN RIEBE WAS ALIVE AT NOW 3:00, AND WE KNOW HE'S DEAD AT 3:22. IT NARROWS THAT TIMELINE. IT PUTS THE MONEY THE PRIORITY, AND OTHER THAN JOHN GETTING THE MONEY, WHO'S THE NEXT ONE TO BENEFIT? LISA TELLS THE DETECTIVES SHE HAD BEEN TALKING TO JOHN EARLIER THAT DAY. SO MY DAD WAS SELF-EMPLOYED. HE DID HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING WORK. A-1 WOULD CONTRACT WORK OUT TO MY DAD. BOB PFEIFFER, HE OWED JOHN SOME MONEY. THAT'S WHAT I THINK LED US TO BELIEVE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN HIM. AFTER JOHN RIEBE WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED... JUST HAVE A SEAT OVER THERE, WOULD YOU PLEASE, LISA? ...EVIDENCE FROM HIS ESTRANGED WIFE RAISES A NEW SUSPECT... THE OWNER OF A-1 HEATING, BOB PFEIFFER. A-1 HEATING IS... WE KNEW IT WAS A BUSINESS ON MONROE STREET. WE DID SOME RESEARCH ON THAT. WE FOUND OUT WHO THE OWNER WAS. WE ALSO FOUND OUT ONE OF THE OTHER MANAGERS THERE, DAN BOYLE. BOTH DAN BOYLE AND BOB PFEIFFER ARE CALLED IN FOR INTERVIEWS. JOHN RIEBE'S PHONE RECORDS SHOW FOUR PHONE CALLS MADE TO A-1 HEATING IN THE MINUTES LEADING UP TO HIS DEATH. THE DETECTIVES ASK DAN BOYLE ABOUT THOSE CALLS. DAN BOYLE SAYS THE FIRST PHONE CALL CAME INTO A-1 HEATING AT 3:04. A-1 HEATING. IT'S READY. JUST COME ON IN AND GET IT. THREE MINUTES LATER, THE PHONE RINGS AGAIN. THE MAN ON THE PHONE CLAIMS HE JUST INSTALLED A FURNACE WITH JOHN RIEBE AND WANTS TO COLLECT HIS SHARE OF THE MONEY. DAN BOYLE'S TESTIMONY MATCHES THE VOICEMAILS LISA RICHMAN BROUGHT TO THE POLICE. WE KNOW JOHN RIEBE, "A," IS STILL ALIVE, "B," HE'S PROBABLY WITH THE PERSON THAT ENDED HIS LIFE AT THAT TIME. THAT SUBJECT WAS UPSET. HE WAS UPSET ABOUT THIS CHECK. HE WAS UPSET ABOUT COMING TO GET THE MONEY, SO AT THAT POINT IN TIME, IT GAVE US THE MOTIVE. A-1. JOHN? YEAH, YOU JUST SPOKE TO DAN. HE TOLD YOU. YOU GOT TO COME DOWN YOURSELF. NO, YOUR HELPER CAN'T COME AND GET IT. PFEIFFER TELLS THE POLICE THE PHONE RANG AGAIN FOUR MINUTES LATER. THE CALLS ABRUPTLY STOP. AT 3:20, FIVE MILES AWAY, THE GIRLS DISCOVER THEIR FATHER'S BODY. THEN AT 4:07, BOB PFEIFFER RECEIVES ONE FINAL CALL. A-1. BETWEEN THE PHONE RECORDS AND THEIR TESTIMONY, BOTH PFEIFFER AND BOYLE HAVE PROVEN THEY AREN'T SUSPECTS, BUT THE POLICE STILL NEED TO KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE SECOND MAN ON THE CALLS. NOW, THAT LAST PHONE CALL, WAS THAT FROM THE SAME MAN AS THE 3:13 CALL? YEAH, DEFINITELY THE SAME MAN, WITHOUT A DOUBT. WITHOUT A DOUBT. THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE, WHEN MR. PFEIFFER... AND HE WAS VERY ADAMANT ABOUT IT. HE SAID, "THAT PERSON THAT CALLED ME AT 4:00 IS THE SAME PERSON THAT WAS ON THOSE OTHER PHONE CALLS." THEY KNOW THAT 4:07 CALL IS THE KEY TO UNLOCKING THE CASE. THAT HAD TIED ALL THE PHONES TOGETHER, TIED THE TIMELINE TOGETHER. AND WHEN THEY CHECK A-1's PHONE RECORDS, THEY DISCOVER IT WAS MADE FROM THE CELLPHONE OF JOHN'S BEST FRIEND, ERIC BABOS. ERIC BABOS IS NOW THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THE MURDER OF JOHN RIEBE. BUT COULD ERIC REALLY HAVE KILLED HIS BEST FRIEND OVER $150? IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ERIC ACTUALLY HAD A COUPLE OF TRAFFIC WARRANTS, MISDEMEANOR WARRANTS, SO WE DECIDED TO EXECUTE THEM UPON ARREST AND EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANTS AND THAT TO TRY TO FIND SOME MATERIALS THAT MAY BE LINKED HIM TO THE DEATH OF JOHN RIEBE. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A GUN. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MURDER WEAPON. LET'S MOVE. THE SEARCH COMES UP EMPTY-HANDED, BUT THEY USE THE ARREST TO QUESTION BABOS. OUR GOAL AT THAT POINT IN TIME WAS TO INTERVIEW HIM AND TO REALLY NARROW HIS STORY DOWN. BABOS ADMITS JOHN OWED HIM $150 BUT DENIES EVER BEING AT HIS HOUSE THAT DAY. DURING THIS TIME FRAME, ERIC WAS HELPING HIS BROTHER GREG FIX UP HIS HOME. THAT WAS HIS ALIBI. BUT ERIC'S BROTHER LEFT HIM ALONE AT THE HOUSE BETWEEN 10:30 A.M. AND 4:00 P.M. HIS ALIBI DOESN'T HOLD ANY WATER. AS AN INTERVIEWER, OR AS AN INVESTIGATOR, YOU HAVE A THEORY. YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH FLOWS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. IT JUST GOES. LIES, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER. DETECTIVE SLAMAN PUSHES BABOS HARD. BUT BABOS DOESN'T CRACK. I FELT THAT, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T CARE. HE DIDN'T CARE THAT JOHN RIEBE WAS DEAD. HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HIS KIDS. I FELT HE WAS PRETTY COLD AND CALCULATED. WITH NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO TIE HIM TO THE MURDER, THE POLICE ARE FORCED TO RELEASE HIM. ON DECEMBER 20th, JOHN RIEBE'S FAMILY GATHER TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. SEEING HIM IN HIS CASKET, THAT'S WHEN IT STARTED TO FEEL REAL, LIKE, "OKAY, WE ARE BURYING HIM. THIS ISN'T A DREAM." WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE IN A CASKET, YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE, "THAT'S IT," AND WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD SEE OUR DAD IN A CASKET WHEN HE WAS 39 YEARS OLD. IT WAS HARD TO ACCEPT. AND OUT OF MY PERIPHERAL VISION, I SAW THREE MEN ENTER, AND I LOOKED OVER, AND I SAW ERIC BABOS WITH HIS BROTHER GREG AND HIS DAD. WE KNEW THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS HAD BEEN QUESTIONING HIM. HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. IT WAS LIKE, THE NERVE. AND, I MEAN, HE WAS JUST LOOKING AROUND, LIKE, JUST ALL JITTERY, AND... HE HAD HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS, AND I'M GOING, LIKE, "WHAT, YOU GOT A GUN IN THERE OR SOMETHING?" WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, SO IT WAS JUST VERY TENSE. MY BROTHERS WERE ANGRY. VERY ANGRY. I MEAN, MY BROTHERS WERE READY TO PUNCH THIS GUY OUT, AND ERIC'S FATHER SAID TO HIM AND HIS BROTHER, "YOU BETTER NOT HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS." CONVINCED BABOS IS GUILTY, DETECTIVES SEARCH FOR ANYTHING TO CONNECT HIM TO THE MURDER. THEY LOOK INTO EVERY MOVEMENT HE MADE ON THE DAY JOHN WAS KILLED. HE TOLD US, AT 4:00 THAT DAY, HE WENT TO A DEPARTMENT STORE WITH HIS BROTHER. THEIR SECURITY GUARD ACTUALLY PULLED UP THAT VIDEO FOR US THAT DAY. JUST START LOOKING FROM 4:30 ONWARDS. STOP IT THERE. ONCE WE SAW THAT SHIRT, THEN WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR. IF ERIC DID SHOOT JOHN, THE POLICE BELIEVE THE CLOTHES HE WAS WEARING THAT DAY COULD HOLD VITAL FORENSIC EVIDENCE. THEY CARRY OUT A SECOND SEARCH OF BABOS' APARTMENT. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT IT. WE HAD THAT SHIRT SENT TO THE BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HERE IN OHIO. THEY FOUND SOMETHING. CHECK IT OUT. THE NEXT MORNING, THE FORENSIC RESULTS COME IN. GUNSHOT RESIDUE ON THE SLEEVE. HE COULDN'T EXPLAIN HOW HE EVER GOT GUNSHOT RESIDUE ON HIM, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO ANY YOU KNOW, SPORTS SHOOTING, HE DIDN'T OWN A FIREARM. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY PIECES OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT WE HAD. - WE GOT HIM. - YEAH. ON DECEMBER 29, 2004, POLICE ARREST ERIC BABOS FOR THE MURDER OF JOHN RIEBE. AT TRIAL, PROSECUTORS PRESENT THEIR CASE TO THE JURY AS TO WHAT HAPPENED ON DECEMBER 15th. ERIC BABOS STARTED HIS DAY DECORATING AT HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE. PHONE RECORDS SHOW HE MADE FOUR CALLS TO RIEBE WITH THE LAST AT 2:00 P.M. HEY, MAN, I REALLY NEED THAT CASH TODAY. YEAH, I WANT TO BUY MY KID A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. NO, NOT TOMORROW, TODAY. I'M SICK OF WAITING AROUND FOR YOU, JOHN. I'M COMING OVER. YEAH, I'M COMING OVER. POLICE BELIEVE HE BIKED THE FOUR MILES FROM HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE TO RIEBE'S. HIS VEHICLE WAS BROKEN DOWN, THAT WE WERE AWARE OF. HE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANOTHER CAR. JOHN HAD BEEN CONSUMING ALCOHOL THAT DAY. WHEN JOHN WAS PARTYING, HE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT DOING ANY DRIVING. THAT ALL MATCHED THAT WHY JOHN DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT DAY. LOOK, I CAN CALL LISA. SHE CAN GO PICK UP THE CHECK. SORT OF WEIGHS ON ME. YOU KNOW, WHAT IF, YOU KNOW, I WASN'T AT WORK? WHAT IF I WOULD HAVE PICKED UP THE PHONE? MAYBE I COULD HAVE SAVED HIM. MAYBE I COULD'VE CALLED THE POLICE. MAYBE I WOULD'VE WENT OVER THERE AND BEEN KILLED ALSO. SO WE CALL A-1. YEAH, MR. BOYLE. HI, IS MY CHECK READY YET? LOOK, YOU WANT YOUR MONEY SO DAMN MUCH, YOU CALL HIM YOURSELF. I WANT MY DAMN MONEY. - Who is this? - I DID A JOB FOR YOU. You're gonna have to get John to come down, okay? CALL HIM AGAIN. THEY'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE THEIR MIND. ERIC BABOS WAS WIRED WITH A BAD ENOUGH TEMPER THAT HE COULDN'T CONTROL IT. MAYBE HE PULLED THE GUN OUT THAT DAY, AND MAYBE JOHN LAUGHED AT HIM. COME ON, MAN. AND HE WASN'T KIDDING AROUND. ERIC KNEW MY DAD WAS WORKING TO TRY TO PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR HIS KIDS. A FAMILY GUY AND SOMEBODY WHO WAS VERY LOVED. HOW CAN YOU MURDER SOMEONE WHEN YOU KNOW THOSE TWO DAUGHTERS ARE GONNA BE HOME IN FIVE MINUTES FROM SCHOOL? I THINK THAT'S THE EPITOME OF EVIL. A-1. RIEBE OWES ME $150. I DID A JOB WITH HIM. CAN I COME DOWN AND GET MY MONEY? Look, you work for Riebe, okay? You get your money from Riebe. DAD? BABOS RETURNED TO HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE, WHERE HE MADE THE 4:07 CALL TO A-1 HEATING. IT WAS ONE OF THE CASES WHERE, YOU KNOW, JUST EVERYTHING KIND OF SEEMED, TO FALL IN PLACE. AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T THINK I CAN THINK OF WHERE YOU COULD EVER GET A TIMELINE LIKE THAT. ERIC BABOS IS FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER AND SENTENCED TO LIFE ON AUGUST 5, 2005. I WAS RELIEVED THAT HE WAS CAUGHT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS IN DISBELIEF THAT A FRIEND... YOU WOULDN'T THINK YOUR BEST FRIEND WOULD KILL YOU OVER A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. BUT I KNEW IT WAS HIM, AND I'M GLAD HE'S LOCKED UP. HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO GET OUT. NEVER. WHY SHOULD HE HAVE A LIFE? THAT'S HOW I FEEL. NO CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST ANY WITNESSES IN RELATION TO THE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE PARTY. I STILL THINK ABOUT MY DAD EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING MARRIED NEXT MONTH. MY DAD WON'T BE THERE. I'LL HAVE KIDS, AND HE WON'T BE THERE. AND THESE ARE REALLY HAPPY MOMENTS FOR ME, AND I KNOW HE WOULD BE HAPPY TOO, AND HE WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BE SAD, BUT THERE'S STILL ALWAYS A PART OF ME THAT WILL BE SAD. I STILL FEEL LIKE HE'S WITH ME. YOU KNOW, HE'S GONE, BUT HE'S STILL HERE WITH US, AT POINTS, TO ME. I STILL FEEL LIKE HE'S HERE WITH ME AND WATCHING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY.
