IT HAD BEEN RAINING, AND SHE HIT A SLICK SPOT IN THE ROAD, AND SHE WENT OFF INTO, LIKE, A DITCH, AND IT ENDED UP BREAKING HER BACK. I WAS TERRIFIED, YOU KNOW? I WAS A CHILD STILL, AND THIS WOMAN THAT HAD BEEN TAKING CARE OF ME MOST OF MY LIFE... YOU KNOW, I WAS TERRIFIED I WAS GONNA LOSE HER. MY DAD... HE WAS A NERVOUS WRECK. HE CAME IMMEDIATELY. HE DROPPED EVERYTHING TO COME BE WITH HER. ♪♪ AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS, TINA WAS ABLE TO WALK AGAIN, BUT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF THE MEDICATION THAT SHE WAS ON. I'D BE GONE ALL DAY LONG AT SCHOOL. MY DAD WAS AT WORK, SO SHE WAS JUST BY HERSELF. SHE WASN'T HAPPY BEING AT HOME ALL THE TIME. ♪♪ MY DAD WASN'T AROUND A LOT BECAUSE HE'S A TRUCK DRIVER.

HAPPY TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE. MY DAD... HE HAD TO PUT RUBY, HIS WIFE, INTO A NURSING HOME 'CAUSE SHE HAD DEMENTIA. WELL, HE WAS LONELY, AND HE WANTED ATTENTION FROM PEOPLE. MY FATHER AND JACK RAINS' MUTUAL LOVE FOR GUNS... IT BONDED THEM, AND THAT LED TO MY DAD INVITING HIM TO THE HOUSE. THIS MAN IN HIS 80s JUST SHOWS UP. HI. LADIES, CHARMED. MY FATHER AND JACK RAINS... THEY'D TALK FOR HOURS ABOUT HANDGUNS. AS GOOD AS THE GLOCK? WELL, HMM. LOOK, THE GLOCK IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. TINA WAS VERY FRIENDLY TO ANYBODY THAT SHE MET. HEY, JACK, WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER AND HAVE A GAME? Lovvarn: THAT'S WHAT SHE ENJOYED... MAKING OTHER PEOPLE FEEL GOOD AND HAVING A GOOD TIME. THAT WAS A SLAP! THAT WAS A SLAP! OH, I GOT ONE. Narrator: OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, THE 83-YEAR-OLD GRANDFATHER STARTS SPENDING MORE TIME WITH RON AND HIS FAMILY. MY DAD... HE LOVED TO COOK ON THE GRILL. - RON, HOW ARE YOU? - HOW ARE YOU? IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. GET SOMETHING TO DRINK. SMELLING GOOD. Lovvarn: AND IF IT WAS PRETTY OUTSIDE AND HE WAS HOME ON THE WEEKENDS, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DOING. Ron: OH, OH! [ CHEERS AND LAUGHTER ] [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] [ COUGHS ] Lovvarn: TINA DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HER OWN FATHER THAT WELL, AND SHE SAW A FATHER FIGURE IN HIM, AND HE WAS WILLING TO BE THAT FOR HER. YOU DOING OKAY OVER HERE? OH, UH, JUST A TIME-OUT. WISH MY DAD HAD SPENT AS MUCH TIME WITH ME AS YOU DO. YOU DON'T TALK TO YOUR DAD? WE WERE NEVER THAT CLOSE. YOUR DADDY WAS A FOOL. Narrator: WITH TINA UNABLE TO DRIVE DUE TO HER MEDICATION, JACK STARTS GIVING HER RIDES INTO TOWN. WELL, HI THERE. Lovvarn: THEY WOULD GO OUT TO EAT AND JUST ENJOY EACH OTHER'S COMPANY. Narrator: IN RETURN, TINA HELPS JACK TAKE CARE OF HIS HOME. Lovvarn: TINA WOULD GO OVER THERE, DO WHAT SHE COULD, YOU KNOW, TO HELP OUT AND TO KEEP HIS HOME LIFE IN ORDER WHERE HE WAS CLUELESS. Narrator: OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS, JACK AND TINA FALL INTO A DAILY ROUTINE. ♪♪ Lovvarn: THAT MORNING, LIKE MOST MORNINGS... ...JACK CAME TO PICK TINA UP. THEY WENT AND GOT SOME FOOD TOGETHER, AND HE BROUGHT HER BACK HOME, AND THEN HE LEFT, AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS HOUSE IN MURFREESBORO. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] ♪♪ [ ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS ] Lovvarn: IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL THAT HE WASN'T ANSWERING. THEY TALKED ON THE PHONE QUITE A BIT. IF HE WASN'T WITH US PHYSICALLY, THEN THERE WAS SOME KIND OF LINE OF COMMUNICATION THERE. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, THE WILLIAMSONS STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM JACK. [ RINGING CONTINUES ] [ ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS ] Lovvarn: AT THAT POINT, NOT BEING ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM... I KNOW THAT THAT HAD TO BE HARD ON MY DAD AND TINA, NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING ON. WHY DON'T YOU CALL HIM AGAIN, SWEETIE? ♪♪ [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] [ ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS ] Lovvarn: I CAN TELL WHAT HE'S FEELING JUST BY THE TONE OF HIS VOICE, AND WHAT I HEARD THERE IS, I COULD TELL THAT HE WAS TRULY CONCERNED. TINA AND MY DAD HAD JUST GOT TO THE POINT, THEY WERE LIKE, "SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. THIS ISN'T NORMAL." THEY HAD A KEY TO GET INTO HIS HOUSE THAT HE HAD GIVEN THEM, SO THEY WERE LIKE, "WE'RE GONNA GO." YOU KNOW, "LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. HE MAY NEED HELP. THERE MAY BE SOMETHING GOING ON." ♪♪ JACK? WHERE ARE YOU, JACK? ♪♪ ♪♪ JACK? JACK! [ STATIC CRACKLING ] Narrator: RON AND TINA WILLIAMSON HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEIR 83-YEAR-OLD FRIEND JACK RAINS FOR OVER 24 HOURS. THEY DRIVE TO HIS HOUSE TO CHECK ON HIM. Lovvarn: MY DAD WALKED TO THE KITCHEN AND FOUND JACK. JACK? JACK! Tina: RON? THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT THAT, YOU KNOW, DID TO HIM IN THAT MOMENT. IT'S HARD TO THINK ABOUT. YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE. GO. JACK! I WANT TO SEE JACK! HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS, "I GOT TO GET TINA OUT OF THERE. SHE CAN'T SEE THIS." THEY WENT TO THE DRIVEWAY AREA, AND THAT'S WHEN TINA, LIKE, STARTED CRYING AND STUFF 'CAUSE SHE KNEW, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS SOMETHING BAD. RON... AND THAT'S WHEN MY DAD CALLED 911. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] [ TELEPHONE BEEPS ] [ SIRENS WAIL ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] ♪♪ Downing: WHEN MY PARTNER AND I ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, TINA AND RON WERE BOTH IN THE DRIVEWAY. THEY WERE VISIBLY UPSET. HI. Tina: [ Crying ] THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED. I WENT TO LOOK FOR JACK IN THE BEDROOM. Ron: AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND JACK IN THE KITCHEN. [ SOBS ] OH, MY GOD. ♪♪ Downing: WE CAME UPON THE VICTIM SEATED AT HIS KITCHEN TABLE, AND BOTH MY PARTNER AND I IMMEDIATELY KNEW THAT WE HAD A HOMICIDE THAT WE WOULD BE INVESTIGATING BASED UPON THE FACT THAT THE VICTIM HAD GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] Downing: HE WAS NOT IN A DEFENSIVE POSTURE. HE WAS ACTUALLY SEATED AT THE KITCHEN TABLE, WEARING BOXER SHORTS AND A T-SHIRT, AND IT BECAME VERY CLEAR AT THAT POINT THAT HE WAS SURPRISED, THAT HE WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE WHEN HE WAS ATTACKED. ♪♪ [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] THERE WERE VALUABLES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE THAT WENT UNTOUCHED. IN HIS BEDROOM, WE FOUND ITEMS THAT WERE MOVED ABOUT... PIECES OF JEWELRY, TITLES TO VEHICLES, THINGS THAT COULD BE OF VALUE TO A COMMON THIEF. THEY WERE LEFT BEHIND. Narrator: THESE CLUES SUGGEST ROBBERY WASN'T THE MOTIVE. WHEN WE COLLECTED EVIDENCE FROM THE HOUSE, WE DID COLLECT THE VICTIM'S CLOTHING. THOSE WERE SUBMITTED TO THE TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS FOR A FORENSIC EVALUATION. [ SIREN WAILS ] WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT DADDY'S DEATH... ...I DIDN'T CRY 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL. HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'VE LOST SOMEBODY LIKE THAT? I WANTED THE KILLERS, OR WHOEVER IT WAS THAT KILLED DADDY... I WANTED THEM CAUGHT AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. NO ONE DESERVES FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO THEM, BUT SOMEONE AS KIND AND GENUINE AND CARING AND LOVING AS JACK WAS... I WAS ANGRY. ♪♪ Downing: THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WAS ABLE TO TELL US AN APPROXIMATE RANGE WHERE THE SUSPECT WAS WHEN THE SHOTS WERE FIRED. THERE WAS ONE SHOT REPORTED AS FROM A DISTANCE. THREE MORE SHOTS WERE PROGRESSIVELY CLOSER TO THE BODY, AND THEN THEY MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BACK OF HIS SKIN AND PULL THE TRIGGER ONE MORE TIME. THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS DEAD. [ GUNSHOT ] ♪♪ Narrator: RON AND TINA WILLIAMSON ARRIVE AT THE RUTHERFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO ASSIST DETECTIVES WITH THE INVESTIGATION. WE WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING IN TODAY. AND BE REASSURED, WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO CATCH THIS KILLER. Downing: TINA AND RON WERE THE COMPLAINANTS... THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS CASE. THEY PUT THEMSELVES ON THE CRIME SCENE, SO IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO PROVE OR DISPROVE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS CASE. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S REPORT STATED THE VICTIM WAS KILLED ON THE DAY BEFORE THEIR BODY WAS DISCOVERED. NOW, WE JUST NEED TO KNOW YOUR WHEREABOUTS BETWEEN 11:30 A.M. AND 12:30 P.M. ON AUGUST 31st. Downing: RON SAID THAT HE WAS AT WORK. HE WAS VISIBLY UPSET. Tina: [ Crying ] JACK PICKED ME UP, AND WE WENT FOR BREAKFAST IN WOODBURY, AND THEN HE TOOK ME BACK, AND I DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE AFTER THAT. TINA PROVIDED US WITH THE ALIBI THAT SHE WAS HOME DURING THE TIME THAT MR. RAINS WAS KILLED. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] ♪♪ Narrator: FOUR DAYS AFTER THE MURDER, THE CORONER'S OFFICE RELEASES JACK'S BODY TO HIS FAMILY. MY FATHER WAS A GREAT MAN. AT THE FUNERAL, MY DAD AND TINA WERE BOTH VERY JUST HEARTBROKEN. I WAS HEARTBROKEN. IT WAS A SMALL GATHERING, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I REMEMBER MOST. I JUST REMEMBER THEM BEING SO SAD. I WAS SO SAD, AND IT WAS HARD. THANK YOU BOTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AT THE FUNERAL HOME, TINA CAME UP TO ME. MY WIFE WAS STANDING THERE BESIDE OF ME, AND SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND MY STOMACH AND HUGGED ME. [ SOBS ] ♪♪ Lovvarn: IT WAS LIKE SHE LOST HER OWN FATHER. [ TINA CONTINUES SOBBING ] Narrator: IN THE DAYS AFTER THE FUNERAL, TINA KEEPS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE INVESTIGATORS. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] DETECTIVE DOWNING SPEAKING. OH, HI, TINA. SHE WAS CALLING BECAUSE SHE CARED ABOUT JACK, AND SHE WANTED TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF THIS CASE. ♪♪ WE RECORDED THESE CALLS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, TINA MIGHT TELL US INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP THE CASE. ♪♪ Lovvarn: ROBERT WAS DATING MY STEPSISTER, AND THEY WERE RENTING OUT A LITTLE DUPLEX THAT WAS OWNED BY JACK RAINS, AND IT'S RIGHT... THEY SHARE, LIKE, A BACKYARD. I MEAN, IT'S WALKING DISTANCE FROM WHERE JACK RAINS LIVED. Narrator: DETECTIVES ASK ROBERT MOTTER TO COME TO THE STATION FOR AN INTERVIEW. - DO YOU MIND? - NO. NO PROBLEM. I, UH... I SAW MR. RAINS ARGUING WITH A BLACK MALE THE OTHER DAY. COULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE? SLIM, KIND OF EARLY 30s. AND WHAT DAY WAS THAT? ABOUT TWO DAYS BEFORE MR. RAINS GOT KILLED. WHAT WERE THEY ARGUING ABOUT? WELL, HE WAS POINTING AT THIS MAN'S MERCEDES, AND, UH, HE LOOKED REALLY ANGRY. I THINK THIS MAN OWED MR. RAINS SOME MONEY. JACK WOULD OFTEN LEND PEOPLE MONEY IF THEY NEEDED TO FIX A CAR OR SOMETHING, BUT HE'D NORMALLY WANT TO GET PAID BACK, YOU KNOW? EXCEPT THIS MAN... HE WASN'T GONNA GIVE JACK A CENT. HE JUST PUSHED HIM DOWN ON THE FLOOR, AND HE DROVE ON OUT OF THERE. IT COULD BE THIS MAN OWED JACK MONEY, AND THEY JUST THOUGHT IT'D BE EASIER TO TAKE HIM OUT, AND THEY WOULDN'T OWE MONEY ANYMORE. WHAT COLOR WAS THAT MERCEDES? UH, CHAMPAGNE. AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS A DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES CHECK FOR VEHICLES THAT MATCHED THAT DESCRIPTION. - HOW'S IT GOING? - GOOD. GOOD. YEAH. I THINK I GOT SOMETHING HERE. WE FOUND THERE WAS, IN FACT, A LATE-'80s-MODEL CHAMPAGNE-COLORED MERCEDES REGISTERED IN THE COUNTY. WE CHECKED THE DRIVER'S LICENSE DATABASE. THAT CHECK DID REVEAL THAT IT WAS REGISTERED TO A BLACK MALE OF APPROXIMATE AGE THAT LIVES IN RUTHERFORD COUNTY. ALL RIGHT, I'LL PAY DAVID JOHNSON A VISIT. GOOD. TOUCH BASE WITH YOU LATER. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ STATIC CRACKLING ] Narrator: ROBERT MOTTER HAS INFORMED DETECTIVES HE WITNESSED 83-YEAR-OLD JACK RAINS ARGUING WITH SOMEBODY DRIVING A CHAMPAGNE-COLORED MERCEDES TWO DAYS BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED. THEY HAVE LINKED THE CAR TO A MAN NAMED DAVID JOHNSON. - DAVID JOHNSON? - YEAH. HI. I'M DETECTIVE DOWNING. COULD I ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS WHEREABOUTS DURING THE TIME OF THE CRIME. HE PROVIDED US WITH AN ALIBI THAT HE WAS AT WORK. CAN YOU PROVE THAT? ♪♪ MR. JOHNSON, AT THE TIME, WORKED AT A COMPANY CALLED STANDARD REGISTER. [ SIGHS ] Narrator: DETECTIVES CONTACT THE COMPANY AND ASK FOR JOHNSON'S TIME CARDS FROM THE DAY OF THE MURDER. TIME CLOCKS AT STANDARD REGISTER REFLECT THAT MR. JOHNSON CLOCKED IN AT 9:00 IN THE MORNING AND THEN TOOK HIS BREAK AT 12:02. HE RETURNED TO WORK AT 12:14, SO WE CHECKED... IS IT POSSIBLE? COULD DAVID JOHNSON HAVE DRIVEN FROM STANDARD REGISTER TO THE VICTIM'S HOUSE, COMMITTED THE MURDER, AND GOT BACK TO WORK? TIME EN ROUTE IS TYPICALLY ABOUT 12 MINUTES. ♪♪ THERE IS JUST NO WAY THAT DAVID JOHNSON COULD HAVE COMMITTED THIS CRIME, EVEN IF HE, YOU KNOW, BROKE EVERY SPEED LIMIT. HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT AND GET BACK IN TIME. WE FOUND THE ONLY BLACK MALE THAT OWNS A CHAMPAGNE MERCEDES IN RUTHERFORD COUNTY. HE DIDN'T HAVE AN ALTERCATION WITH THE VICTIM, AND HE'S NOT THE GUY THAT KILLED JACK RAINS. Narrator: NOW SERIOUSLY DOUBTING ROBERT'S STORY, POLICE CALL HIM BACK IN FOR QUESTIONING. ♪♪ WE FOUND A MAN THAT MATCHES YOUR DESCRIPTION YOU GAVE US. YOU SURE YOU SAW THIS MAN? IN A SECOND INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT MOTTER, HE CHANGED HIS STORY. HE DID NOT SEE THE CONFRONTATION WITH A BLACK MALE. HE WAS TOLD TO TELL US ABOUT IT BY TINA. AND WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT? HE SUSPECTED THAT TINA AND THE VICTIM WERE HAVING A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP. IT DID SEEM ODD TO ME. I MEAN, FIRST, SHE'S A MARRIED WOMAN, AND HE'S A MARRIED MAN, BUT MORE THAN THAT, HE'S IN HIS 80s, AND SHE'S IN HER 30s. Narrator: DETECTIVES BRING TINA IN FOR QUESTIONING. TINA ALSO DENIES COACHING ROBERT INTO TELLING THE POLICE ABOUT DAVID JOHNSON. BOTH TINA AND ROBERT ARE RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE, BUT INVESTIGATORS NOW KNOW ONE OF THEM IS LYING AND DECIDE TO ASK TINA'S HUSBAND, RON, ABOUT A POSSIBLE AFFAIR. IF THERE IS A TRIANGLE WHERE THERE'S A HUSBAND, A WIFE, AND THEN A THIRD PARTY, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HUSBAND AS BEING THE PERSON THAT YOU NEED TO ELIMINATE FIRST AS SUSPECT. Downing: WE TOLD RON ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT TINA WAS HAVING A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM. THAT'S MY WIFE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. RON WAS UPSET. Narrator: THEY NEED TO LOOK INTO RON'S ALIBI AT THE TIME OF JACK'S DEATH. WE WANTED TO SEE, BECAUSE HE WAS A LONG-HAUL TRUCK DRIVER, WAS HE IN TOWN? WAS HE IN THE STATE? WAS HE ANYWHERE NEARBY AT THE TIME THAT MR. RAINS WAS KILLED? Narrator: DETECTIVE DOWNING OBTAINS RON'S TIME SHEET FOR THE DAY OF THE MURDER. Newman: RON'S WORK RECORDS HAD INDICATED THAT HE HAD LEFT THAT MORNING, ABOUT 8:30 IN THE MORNING, AND HE HAD COME BACK AFTER MAKING HIS DELIVERY SOME TIME AROUND 11:30. BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THE CRIME HAD OCCURRED SOME TIME BETWEEN 11:00 AND 12:30 IN THE AFTERNOON, THOSE RECORDS DID NOT ELIMINATE HIM AS A SUSPECT. ♪♪ Narrator: WITH RON'S ALIBI NOW IN QUESTION, THE LAB RESULTS ON THE CLOTHES JACK WORE ON THE NIGHT OF HIS MURDER COME IN. YOU NEED TO READ WHAT THE TBI FOUND. ♪♪ TRACES OF JACK'S DNA ARE FOUND ON HIS BOXER SHORTS MIXED WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S. ♪♪ IT WAS THE TYPE OF DNA THAT YOU GET FROM SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. Downing: THE VICTIM'S SEMEN WAS MIXED WITH AN UNKNOWN FEMALE'S DNA, SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA WANT TO CHECK AND SEE, IS THIS UNKNOWN FEMALE... IS THIS TINA WILLIAMSON? [ STATIC CRACKLING ] Narrator: THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF 83-YEAR-OLD JACK RAINS HAS TAKEN A SHOCKING TURN. TESTS HAVE REVEALED THAT STAINS ON HIS BOXER SHORTS CONTAIN A MIXTURE OF HIS SEMEN AND FEMALE DNA. WITH ALLEGATIONS SWIRLING THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH TINA WILLIAMSON, DETECTIVES COMPARE THE UNKNOWN DNA TO HERS. ♪♪ DETECTIVE MAYERCIK. Mayercik: I'VE GOT A BUDDY AT THE TENNESSEE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION. HE CALLED ME AND SAID, "HEY, I GOT SOME GREAT NEWS FOR YOU." THEY HAD TINA WILLIAMSON'S DNA THERE IN THE FLAP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU NEED TO SEND THAT REPORT UP TO US RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU. Mayercik: FOR IT TO BE IN THE FLAP TELLS ME THAT THEY'RE HAVING INTERCOURSE, AND HIS PENIS WAS THROUGH THE FLAP, AND HIS BOXERS WERE STILL ON. Gary: WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT DADDY AND TINA HAD A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP, I THOUGHT THAT WAS SICK. IT WAS BAD ON DADDY'S PART, AND IT WAS EVEN WORSE ON HERS. YEAH! Narrator: NOW SUSPECTING TINA WAS SLEEPING WITH JACK, INVESTIGATORS GET A WARRANT FOR TINA AND RON'S CELLPHONE RECORDS... AUGUST 31st, 2007. Narrator: ...TO PINPOINT WHERE THEY WERE ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER. Downing: THERE ARE VARIOUS CELLPHONE TOWERS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT REALLY CLOSE TO THE VICTIM'S HOUSE IS A CELLPHONE TOWER, SO ANY CALLS MADE NEAR HIS HOUSE WOULD IMMEDIATELY GO TO THAT TOWER. Narrator: THE FIRST RECORDS TO COME THROUGH ARE RON'S. DETECTIVE DOWNING CHECKS IF HE WAS NEAR JACK'S HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER. ♪♪ BUT HE FINDS NO CALLS FROM RON'S PHONE PINGING THAT TOWER. IN FACT, THE PHONE RECORDS CONFIRM RON'S ALIBI THAT HE WAS WORKING IN ANOTHER TOWN. RON WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE VICTIM'S HOUSE WHEN MR. RAINS WAS MURDERED, SO RON WAS EXCLUDED AS A SUSPECT. ♪♪ Downing: AT THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION, WE HAVE ALREADY ELIMINATED DAVID JOHNSON AS A SUSPECT, AND NOW WE'VE ELIMINATED RON AS A SUSPECT, AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT TINA WILLIAMSON IS HAVING A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM, SO SHE WAS THE PRIME SUSPECT. ♪♪ Narrator: AFTER STRIKING OUT WITH TINA, DETECTIVES HOPE HER CELLPHONE RECORDS WILL PROVIDE FRESH CLUES ABOUT HER MOVEMENTS ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER. TINA, FROM THE BEGINNING, HAD PROVIDED HER ALIBI AS BEING THAT SHE AND JACK RAINS WENT TO BREAKFAST TOGETHER IN WOODBURY AT 9:00 AND THAT HE TOOK HER HOME IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND THAT HE RETURNED TO MURFREESBORO. FROM HER REPORT, I DISCOVERED THAT TINA MADE THREE TELEPHONE CALLS IN THE TIME FRAME THAT JACK RAINS WAS MURDERED FROM THE VICTIM'S CELLPHONE TOWER. THAT TOLD ME THAT SHE WASN'T HOME WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS AT HOME. IN FACT, SHE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE VICTIM'S HOUSE AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH. ♪♪ THOSE THREE CALLS WERE ALL MADE TO ONE PERSON... BETTY OLSON. WE WANTED TO FIND OUT, WHY WAS SHE CALLING HER? WHAT WAS SHE SAYING? Narrator: DETECTIVES TRACK DOWN BETTY OLSON AND PAY HER A VISIT, ARMED WITH A DEVICE TO RECORD THE CONVERSATION. Downing: A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE RESPOND TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW, WE WILL TURN THE RECORDER ON AHEAD OF TIME. [ DOGS BARKING ] HELLO. SHE HAD DOGS THAT WERE VERY NOISY. THEY WERE LITTLE, ANNOYING DOGS. THEY WEREN'T THREATENING. THEY WERE JUST LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS LITTLE DOGS. [ BARKING CONTINUES ] Downing: THAT TOLD US THAT TINA HAD SOMETHING TO HIDE. I WAS EXCITED INSIDE. I DIDN'T DISPLAY THAT TO BETTY. AND THEN BETTY TOLD US THAT SHE PICKED UP TINA ON JOHN BRAGG HIGHWAY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE VICTIM'S HOUSE ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER. Narrator: THE SPOT WHERE BETTY PICKED TINA UP IS JUST A MILE FROM JACK RAINS' HOUSE. Newman: AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT, WE FELT LIKE OUR CASE WAS BEGINNING TO COME TOGETHER, BUT WE NEEDED MORE INFORMATION. WE NEEDED THE EVIDENCE ABOUT WHY SHE WAS IN MURFREESBORO. Narrator: BETTY INSISTS SHE HAD NO IDEA WHY TINA WAS THERE, ONLY THAT HER FRIEND ASKED HER TO KEEP THE RIDE A SECRET. Downing: I BELIEVE THAT BETTY THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS BECAUSE SHE DID PROVIDE A RIDE, SO SHE KNOWS IT'S QUITE SERIOUS. WE ASKED BETTY OLSON TO WEAR A WIRE TO RECORD HER CONVERSATION WITH TINA WILLIAMSON. BETTY AGREED TO DO THAT FOR US. WE POSITIONED OUR UNMARKED VEHICLE APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET FROM WHERE THEY WERE MEETING. THAT DISTANCE IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHERE IF SOMETHING BAD WERE TO HAPPEN, WE COULD GET THERE QUICKLY. Newman: WE RECOGNIZED THAT IF TINA WILLIAMSON KNEW THAT BETTY OLSON WAS WEARING A WIRE, SHE IS SUBJECT TO BEING HARMED OR EVEN KILLED. [ STATIC CRACKLING ] Narrator: BETTY OLSON HAS AGREED TO HELP DETECTIVES COLLECT EVIDENCE AGAINST HER FRIEND TINA WILLIAMSON, THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THE MURDER OF JACK RAINS. SHE'S HEADED TO TINA'S HOUSE WEARING A WIRE. - HI. - HI. COME ON IN. ♪♪ Downing: WE WERE HOPING THAT TINA WOULD JUST GO AHEAD AND TELL HER EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER. ♪♪ TINA TOLD BETTY THAT SHE WAS BETTER OFF WITH MR. RAINS ALIVE, AND SO IT WASN'T WHAT WE HOPED FOR AT THE TIME. IF TINA KILLED THE GOLDEN GOOSE, THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON. ♪♪ Narrator: TO CONFIRM THAT JACK WAS GIVING TINA MONEY, DETECTIVES SUBPOENA HIS FINANCIAL RECORDS. Newman: WE DISCOVERED TINA HAD JOINT BANKING ACCOUNTS WITH JACK RAINS. THEY HAD A $100,000 CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT THAT THEY HAD BOTH NAMES ON. WITH JACK RAINS NO LONGER BEING ALIVE, SHE HAD ACCESS TO $100,000. IT'S 100,000 REASONS WHY SHE WOULD WANT TO KILL JACK RAINS. Newman: TINA WOULD TO HAD TO HAVE MANIPULATED JACK TO GET THAT MONEY AND CONVINCED HIM, "WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU IF SOMETHING EVER HAPPENS TO YOU," AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS SUCH THAT HE TRUSTED HER. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE TINA, AND YOU'RE THINKING, "GEE, IF THIS CAT HAS A STROKE, THEN I'VE GOT TO ACTUALLY USE THIS MONEY FOR HIM, THEN I'M NOT GONNA GET IT. THAT'S $100,000. THAT'LL GO QUICK." [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] DETECTIVE MAYERCIK. UH-HUH. Narrator: SIX DAYS AFTER THE MURDER, JACK'S BANK CONTACTS DETECTIVES WITH NEWS OF ACCOUNT ACTIVITY. Mayercik: THE BANK CALLED ME AND SAID, "HEY. TINA'S DOWN HERE TRYING TO CASH THIS $100,000 ACCOUNT OUT." THE BANK EMPLOYEES WERE LIKE, "SHE SHOWED UP. SHE'S VISIBLY SHAKING. SHE'S SAYING, 'HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO GET THIS MONEY. I'M ON THE ACCOUNT.'" AND I'M LIKE, "YOU GUYS INTERNALLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HOLD ON TO THAT MONEY." Narrator: THE BANK FREEZES THE ACCOUNT, AND TINA LEAVES EMPTY-HANDED. Newman: WE FELT WE HAD A STRONG CASE AGAINST TINA WILLIAMSON, BUT YOU GOT TO PROVE THAT SOMEONE IS GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. WE NEEDED EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE REASONABLE DOUBT. Narrator: DETECTIVES ONCE AGAIN TURN TO BETTY TO HELP THEM GET THE EVIDENCE THEY NEED. Downing: BETTY PROVIDED A RIDE FROM NEAR THE VICTIM'S HOUSE. IF TINA WOULD ADMIT TO RECEIVING THAT RIDE FROM BETTY OLSON ON THAT DAY, THERE WOULD BE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME. Narrator: BETTY CALLS TINA WHILE POLICE LISTEN IN AND RECORD THE CALL. JUST RELAX AND BE YOURSELF, OKAY? YOU CAN DO THIS. ♪♪ Mayercik: NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T DESCRIBE KILLING SOMEONE TO A FRIEND. THAT'S THE LANGUAGE OF A KILLER. ♪♪ THE TONE IN HER VOICE TOLD ME THAT TINA WAS GETTING WORRIED AND THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT PRESSURE MIGHT BE COMING ON BETTY. AND I REMEMBER TELLING, "OH, I SURE HOPE THAT GOT ON TAPE." 'CAUSE IT WAS LIKE, "HOLY MOLY. I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE JUST SAID THAT." Downing: BASED UPON THE VOICE MAILS THAT WERE LEFT ON THE VICTIM'S PHONE, TINA HAD THE ALIBI THAT SHE WAS HOME DURING THE TIME THAT MR. RAINS WAS KILLED. AT FIRST, WE BELIEVED THAT SHE WAS CALLING BECAUSE SHE CARED ABOUT HER FRIEND. I KNOW NOW THAT SHE WAS BEING INSINCERE AND TRYING TO THROW US OFF THE TRACK BECAUSE SHE, IN FACT, WAS THE KILLER. [ SIRENS WAIL ] ♪♪ Narrator: ON THE 4th OF DECEMBER, 2007, TINA IS ARRESTED FOR THE MURDER OF JACK RAINS. WE WERE GETTING CLOSER TO OUR HOUSE, AND IT WAS, LIKE, GLOWING BLUE BECAUSE OF ALL THE POLICE AND ALL OF THE COP CARS. IT TERRIFIED ME. NO, PLEASE, NO! TINA, TINA! TINA DIDN'T SHOW ANY EMOTION. SHE WASN'T ANGRY. SHE DIDN'T CRY. SHE DIDN'T CARRY ON. SHE WAS JUST VOID OF EMOTION. Lovvarn: SHE WAS MY ROCK. I WAS RAISED BY TINA, YOU KNOW? IT WAS JUST ME AND HER AT HOME FOR SO LONG. WHEN THEY TOOK HER AWAY, THEY TOOK A PART OF ME AWAY. Narrator: AT TRIAL, TINA WILLIAMSON IS FOUND GUILTY OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER AND FELONY MURDER. SHE IS SENTENCED TO 71 YEARS IN PRISON. Gary: SINCE EVERYTHING IS OVER WITH, AND I KNOW TINA IS IN PRISON, WHERE SHE NEEDS TO BE, I DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT NO MORE. BUT EVERY TIME I DRIVE BY DAD'S HOUSE, I LOOK OVER THERE AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT WENT ON THERE. SHE NEVER CARED FOR HIM. SHE DIDN'T CARE FOR DADDY AT ALL. ALL SHE WANTED WAS WHAT SHE COULD GET OUT OF HIM. FOR TINA TO COME INTO MY DADDY'S HOUSE, HAVE SEX WITH MY DADDY, HIM GO IN AND SIT DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE... ...AND HER TO COME AROUND BEHIND HIM AND SHOOT HIM FIVE TIMES IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD... THAT'S COLD-BLOODED, EVIL MURDER. [ GUNSHOT ] I KNOW WHO THE WOMAN WAS AND IS, AND SHE'S JUST NOT SOMEONE THAT COULD HAVE DONE THIS. THAT'S HOW I CHOOSE TO LOOK AT IT. JUST LIKE STEPHANIE, I ENCOUNTER A LOT OF RELATIVES OF SUSPECTS WHO DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SOMEONE THEY LOVE IS CAPABLE OF DOING SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC, BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT... PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS. [ GUNSHOT ]
