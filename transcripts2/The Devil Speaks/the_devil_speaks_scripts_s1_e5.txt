 HE SAID IT'S EVIL. I SAID IT IS EVIL. OKAY. IF HE'S CONFESSED TO YOU ONCE, WILL HE TALK ABOUT IT TO YOU AGAIN AND CAN WE GET IT ON TAPE? NOW IT WAS DECEMBER. WE WERE VOTING ON THE VESTRY AND I WAS UP FOR ONE OF THE PLACES. OUR DAUGHTER, MISSY, WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO CHURCH WITH US AND SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP AND WE COULDN'T' GET HER ON THE PHONE.

 SO WE SAID, "WELL, LET'S GO CHECK ON HER." SHE HAD A SLIDING DOOR IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND IT WAS OPEN AND THE CURTAINS WERE BLOWING AND EVERYTHING. MISSY? SHE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SO THE DOGS COULD COME IN AND OUT. SO THAT WASN'T REAL UNUSUAL, BUT THE FEELING WAS. MISSY? HE SAID, "DON'T COME IN HERE." I SAID, "IS IT MISSY?" AND HE SAID, "YEAH." "I'M COMING IN THERE." SHE WAS ON HER BED FACEDOWN NAKED FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

 MISSY? MISSY? SUDDENLY MY HAND WAS ON HER BACK. TOLD HER I LOVED HER. MISSY? IT WAS SO COLD. NO. AND HER FACE WAS LAYING SIDEWAYS AND SHE LOOKED BEAUTIFUL. BUT I KNEW SHE HAD A REAL BAD INJURY ON THE BACK OF HER HEAD. THERE WAS BLOOD IN HER HAIR. SHE WAS FACEDOWN AND HER HANDS WERE BOUND WITH ONE OF THOSE ZIPTIE THINGS BEHIND HER BACK. IT WAS JUST UNGODLY, YOU KNOW. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. SHE'S DEAD AND SHE'S GONE. 36-YEAR-OLD MISSY ATKIN WAS THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY. SHE HAD THOSE BRIGHT BLUE SPARKLING EYES THAT JUST SPOKE VOLUMES ABOUT WHO SHE WAS AS AN INDIVIDUAL. COMPASSIONATE AND FUN-LOVING AND KIND AND JUST A BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. OKAY... MISSY'S 5-YEAR-OLD SON, LUCAS, WAS HER WORLD. THEY DID KARATE TOGETHER WHEN LUCAS WAS 4, THEY JOINED KARATE. AND DOWN. AND IT WAS A BONDING THING, YOU KNOW? HEY, EXCUSE ME, MISTER. IT WAS VERY NATURAL FOR THEM. WATCHING MISSY WITH LUCAS, WAS JUST... THEY WERE BUDDIES. EVERY CHOICE SHE MADE, EVERY STEP SHE TOOK WAS ABOUT LUCAS. COME ON IN. IT'S OPEN. MISSY SHARED CUSTODY OF LUCAS WITH HIS FATHER, SCOTT REYNOLDS. HEY, BUDDY. HOW YA DOIN'? SCOTT GOT HIM EVERY OTHER WEEKEND AND ON WEDNESDAYS. WE GOT TO GET GOING, MAN. IT WAS SCOTT'S WEEKEND TO HAVE LUKE FOR THAT WEEKEND. OKAY. YOU TWO HAVE FUN. WHEN I GOT TO THE SCENE, THE PATROL GUYS HAD ALREADY SECURED EVERYTHING. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD IT IS FOR DOUG AND LINDA TO FIND THEIR CHILD LIKE THAT. IT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA CARRY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WELL, BRYANT. THIS WAS MY FIRST HOMICIDE CASE AS A DETECTIVE. I MEAN, YOU SEE IT ON TV ALL THE TIME AND NOW YOU'RE IN THAT ROLE AND YOU'RE LIVING IT AND IT'S A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AT FIRST. YOU START WORKING THE SCENE, GATHERING ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE THAT YOU CAN. YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING. WHAT'S NORMAL FOR THAT HOUSEHOLD, WHAT'S ABNORMAL. WE DID FIND A MUDDY FOOTPRINT INSIDE THE BACKDOOR. THE TRACKS ACTUALLY WENT IN AND WE COULD SEE SOME ADDITIONAL MUD GOING DOWN THE HALLWAY INTO MISSY'S BEDROOM. SOMEBODY WAS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY BIND AND SECURE HER. ZIPTIES TIED AROUND HER WRISTS. IF YOU'RE BOUND FROM BEHIND AND DRESSED AS SHE WAS BEING IN THE BED, THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. SHE WAS KILLED RIGHT THERE ON THE BED. THAT WAS PRETTY CLEAR. AND YOU COULD SEE WHERE THE BLOOD WAS POOLING AND POURING OFF THE EDGE OF THE BED. SHE HAD, FROM WHAT WE COULD TELL AT THAT TIME, THREE OR FOUR GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD. SHOT AT POINT BLANK, I'D SAY. WHEN MELISSA WAS MOVED, WE FOUND A PROJECTILE IN THE MATTRESS. IT WAS A .32 CALIBER. SO IT WAS A FAIRLY SMALL PROJECTILE. THE PROJECTILE CAN BE A VERY IMPORTANT CLUE. YOU CAN START NARROWING DOWN THE TYPE OF WEAPON, THE TYPE OF AMMUNITION, WHO MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. THE WAY THAT SHE WAS FOUND AND OBVIOUSLY THE GUNSHOT WOUNDS THAT WERE TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD, IT LOOKED LIKE AN EXECUTION TYPE OF MURDER. AS THE FORENSIC TEAM SCOURS THE CRIME SCENE FOR CLUES, MISSY'S PARENTS ARE INTERVIEWED BY THE DETECTIVES. I'M SURE YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOU NOT TO REMEMBER, YOU KNOW. IT WAS A VERY WEIRD SENSATION. THE WHOLE THING WAS. LIKE YOU WERE WATCHING A BAD B MOVIE. I SMELL SOMETHING DELICIOUS. - HI, DADDY. - HEY. YOU TWO BACK ALREADY? - WE ARE. - GREAT. WITH LUCAS AT HIS DAD'S FOR THE WEEKEND, MISSY SPENT THE DAY PLANNING HER SON'S 6th BIRTHDAY PARTY. - DID YOU GET EVERYTHING? - WE DID. CHECK IT OUT. FOR THE KARATE PARTY. - HE'S GONNA LOVE THAT. - YEAH. THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST DAY MISSY AND I EVER SPENT TOGETHER. - WE GOT ENOUGH STUFF? - I THINK SO. WE GIGGLED AND LAUGHED AND TALKED AND WENT OVER LIFE. MY GOODNESS. AND THEN SHE GOT UP TO LEAVE. - THANK YOU. - HONEY. THANK YOU FOR TODAY. OKAY, MISSY. AND I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, AND I BEGGED HER TO STAY OVERNIGHT. I NEVER ASKED HER TO DO THAT BEFORE. - DAD, I'M GONNA HIT THE ROAD. - ALL RIGHT. BUT MISSY WAS PLANNING ON GOING TO WALMART THAT NIGHT AND SAID SHE'D SEE THEM TOMORROW IN CHURCH. I'LL PHONE YOU AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWAKE, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. ENJOY DINNER. - BYE. - CIAO. MISSY'S PARENTS SAY THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON IN HER LIFE WITH WHOM SHE HAD ANY CONFLICT. OKAY. COME ON IN! IT'S OPEN. YOUR DADDY'S HERE. HEY, BUDDY. HOW YA DOIN'? WE GOTTA GO. DON'T LET HIM GET UP AFTER 9. YEAH, I GOT IT. AND HOME ON SUNDAY 'CAUSE HE'S GOT SCHOOL. WELL, NO, 'CAUSE IT'S MY WEEKEND WITH HIM AND I GOT HIM UNTIL MONDAY. NOW, YOU KNOW THAT. - COME ON, BUDDY. - COME ON. AFTER A ROCKY 10-YEAR RELATIONSHIP, MISSY AND SCOTT SEPARATED 18 MONTHS AGO. OKAY, YOU TWO HAVE FUN. IT WASN'T WORKING BETWEEN HER AND SCOTT, BUT SHE DID WANT IT WORK BETWEEN SCOTT AND LUCAS. AND HE THOUGHT SHE WAS TRYING TO TAKE HIM AWAY FROM HIM AND SHE NEVER HAD THAT THOUGHT IN HER HEAD EVER. AFTER MISSY ATKIN IS BRUTALLY MURDERED, HER PARENTS SUSPECT THE INVOLVEMENT OF HER EX-PARTNER, SCOTT REYNOLDS. DOUG AND LINDA ARE VERY CONVINCED THAT SCOTT REYNOLDS WAS THE KILLER. OUR REACTION IS WE TAKE IN ALL THE INFORMATION AND THEN TRY NOT TO GET TUNNEL VISION. A LOT OF TIMES FAMILY IS JADED AND THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. THE DAY AFTER THE MURDER, DETECTIVES SUMMON SCOTT TO THE STATION FOR AN INTERVIEW. HE WAS SOMBER. HE WAS VERY QUIET. HEY, DOUG. LINDA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. AND I WENT UP AND KISSED SCOTT BECAUSE I WANTED HIM TO THINK I WAS FRIENDLY. ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS I'VE EVER DONE. GO ON, CHAMP. YOU'RE GONNA GO STAY WITH GRANDMA. AS A POTENTIAL SUSPECT, HE HAS TO RELINQUISH CUSTODY OF HIS SON. POLICE FIND SCOTT CANDID AND READY TO HELP IN ANY WAY HE CAN. HE WAS VERY CALM. HE DIDN'T SEEM WORRIED. HE SEEMED VERY CONFIDENT. I TRIED TO MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE SO THAT HE WOULD TALK. SCOTT ADMITS HE AND MISSY HAD BEEN ARGUING OVER CUSTODY OF THEIR SON. CLEARLY HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH THE SITUATION, BUT IT WAS HIS WEEKEND TO HAVE LUKE ACCORDING TO THE CUSTODY. SCOTT TELLS DETECTIVES HE STAYED AT HIS FRIEND EVE'S HOUSE ALL WEEKEND WITH LUCAS AND TANNER, HIS 18-YEAR-OLD STEPSON FROM A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP. ANYTIME SOMEBODY GIVES US A STATEMENT, IF THEY'VE GOT AN ALIBI OR A STORY AS TO WHERE THEY'VE BEEN, WE'RE GONNA DOUBLE CHECK THAT. POLICE CALL EVE BARGER IN FOR QUESTIONING. OKAY, UM... IT SEEMS SCOTT AND EVE ARE MORE THAN FRIENDS. THEY'VE BEEN DATING FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS. SCOTT WOKE HER AND TOLD HER HE WAS GOING TO TAKE TANNER OUT DEER HUNTING. WHILE SCOTT WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE, LUCAS HAD WOKE UP AND I BELIEVE HE WAS CRYING AND UPSET FOR SOME REASON AND HE GOT IN THE BED WITH EVE. WHEN SCOTT GOT BACK HE GOT IN THE BED WITH THE TWO OF THEM. SHE CORROBORATED SCOTT'S INTERVIEW. EVE TELLS THEM THEY GOT UP LATER THAT MORNING AROUND 9:30 A.M. AND SPENT SUNDAY TOGETHER BEFORE SCOTT LEFT THAT EVENING. I BELIEVE HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK OR HAD JUST LEFT AND RECEIVED A PHONE CALL THAT MISSY HAD BEEN KILLED. TO DOUBLE CHECK SCOTT'S ALIBI, DETECTIVES PULL IN HIS STEPSON, TANNER. TANNER DID SAY THAT IT WAS ABOUT 4:00 THAT HE WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE DEER STAND. HE SAID THAT HE WAS TOLD BY SCOTT THAT, "I'M GONNA GO BACK, BUT IF I HEAR A GUNSHOT, I'LL COME BACK." AFTER HE LEFT TANNER, SCOTT CAME BACK TO EVE'S BEDROOM AROUND 5:00 A.M. LEAVING JUST ONE HOUR UNACCOUNTED FOR. SCOTT REYNOLDS WOULD'VE HAD TO TRAVEL SOME 50 MILES BACK AND FORTH. SO 100 MILES. SO TIME WAS A VERY BIG CONCERN. DID HE HAVE THE TIME TO LEAVE, GET IN THE HOUSE, KILL HER, GET BACK IN THE CAR, AND GET BACK? INVESTIGATORS CALCULATE THE DRIVING DISTANCE IN TIME AND CONCLUDE HE DID NOT. SCOTT'S ALIBI WAS SOLID. IT DID SEEM TO FALL INTO PLACE THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH. POLICE ARE BACK TO SQUARE ONE. THEY NEED A NEW LEAD. WE'VE GOT TO LEARN AS MUCH AS WE CAN ABOUT MISSY. EACH ONE OF US HAS OUR OWN PERSONAL LIVES THAT WE DON'T SHARE WITH EVERYBODY. MAYBE NOT EVEN FAMILY. SO WE'VE GOT TO PULL THAT OUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO FIND OUT THE HIDDEN INFORMATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS. START LOOKING TOWARDS WHO MIGHT BE ANOTHER SUSPECT, PARTICULARLY WHO SHE MIGHT'VE TALKED TO LAST. MISSY'S PARENTS TOLD POLICE SHE WAS HEADED TO WALMART AFTER SHE LEFT THEIR HOUSE THAT NIGHT. CUE IT UP TO 8:00 P.M. SO INVESTIGATORS PULL THE SECURITY FOOTAGE AND START HUNTING FOR ANY SIGN OF HER. ALL RIGHT, PAUSE IT THERE. THAT'S HER. WE FIND MISSY ARRIVE AT WALMART IN THE EVENING ON SATURDAY. SHE COMES IN BY HERSELF. PLAY IT FROM THERE. CAMERAS SHOW SHE ENTERED THE STORE AT 8:52 P.M. WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE MIGHT'VE RUN ACROSS THE WRONG PERSON OR IF SHE MIGHT'VE BEEN FOLLOWED AFTERWARDS. SHE MIGHT'VE MADE SOMEBODY ANGRY. WE DIDN'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT, WHERE IS SHE GOING NEXT? WHOA. WHO'S THAT GUY? AT 9:30 P.M., A MYSTERY MAN APPROACHES MELISSA WEARING A GREY SWEATER AND BLACK CAP. DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS. THEY TALK FOR ALMOST AN HOUR. YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK TO JUST ANYBODY FOR AN HOUR. IT'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY THAT'S PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO YOU THAT YOU KNOW VERY WELL. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO SHE WAS TALKING TO. AFTER THE CONVERSATION, THE MAN AND MISSY PART WAYS. AND POLICE NOTICE THAT MISSY IS TALKING ON HER CELLPHONE. THE NEXT STEP IS TO PULL PHONE RECORDS, SEE WHO'S BEEN CALLING WHO. THE LAST CALL TO COME IN TO MISSY'S PHONE WAS FROM A FAMILY MEMBER. I CALLED HER PROBABLY ABOUT 10:30, 11:00. I WAS THE LAST ONE TO TALK TO HER THAT SATURDAY NIGHT. CRUCIALLY, KEN IS ABLE TO TELL POLICE THE MAN WHO SPOKE TO MISSY FOR AN HOUR IS ONE OF HIS BEST BUDDIES, TODD BURFIELD. MELISSA'S BROTHER, KEN, HAD CALLED AND TODD HAD PICKED UP THE PHONE JOKINGLY TO ANSWER "HELLO?" YOU KNOW, WITH A MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE WHICH KIND OF SURPRISED HER BROTHER. COULD THIS PERSON HAVE COME TO HER HOUSE LATER? I MEAN, THIS IS THE PERSON ESSENTIALLY THAT SAW HER LAST ALIVE. POLICE ARE ON THE HUNT FOR MELISSA ATKIN'S KILLER. WALMART SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE SHOWS HER TALKING TO FAMILY FRIEND, TODD BURFIELD, THE NIGHT SHE WAS MURDERED. WE'VE GOT TO INTERVIEW TODD BURFIELD AND FIND OUT WHO TODD IS AND WHAT HIS RELATIONSHIP IS WITH MISSY. TODD TELLS POLICE HE'S KNOWN MISSY SINCE BECOMING FRIENDS WITH HER BROTHER IN HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS A VERY CLOSE FRIENDSHIP. NOTHING ROMANTIC OR ANYTHING INVOLVED LIKE THAT. BUT HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT IF HE WEREN'T MARRIED TO HIS WIFE, MELISSA WOULD BE THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT HE WOULD WANT TO BE WITH. TODD'S INTEREST IN MISSY PUTS HIM FIRMLY ON THE SUSPECT LIST. HE CLAIMS THAT AFTER HE SPOKE TO MISSY, HE LEFT THE STORE AND DROVE HOME. HE'D GOT HOME BEFORE HIS WIFE AND THEN IT WAS A SHORT TIME LATER, MAYBE 20 MINUTES OR SO, AND SHE HAD RETURNED HOME. DETECTIVE GREGORY HEADS TO TODD'S ADDRESS TO TALK TO HIS WIFE, TINA. I SPOKE WITH TINA TO PIN DOWN TODD'S TIMELINE. SHE TELLS THE DETECTIVE HER HUSBAND WAS HOME WHEN SHE RETURNED AROUND 11:30 P.M. WE WERE ABLE TO SEE ON THE TIMESTAMP ON THE WALMART VIDEO THAT MELISSA HAD LEFT WALMART AT 11:30. SO WE WERE ABLE TO EXCLUDE TODD FROM THE SUSPECT POOL. IT'S A MAJOR BLOW TO THE INVESTIGATION. BUT AS ONE AVENUE SHUTS DOWN, ANOTHER OPENS UP. THEY RECEIVE A CALL FROM MISSY'S ATTORNEY, MITCH SHANNON. MELISSA HAD HIRED ATTORNEY MITCH SHANNON TO HELP HER WITH THE CUSTODY AND VISITATION ISSUES. SHE WOULD COME IN FOR A MEETING WITH THE ATTORNEY AND DURING THAT TIME, SCOTT REYNOLDS WOULD CALL HER CONSTANTLY. HE SAID SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS 15 TIMES. Let's just sort this out ourselves, okay? Look, you and me. HE DID REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY ONE OCCASION MELISSA PUT HIM ON SPEAKERPHONE. You know I can get rid of your attorney. It's not a problem. I know where he lives. I followed him home. HE SAID, "I KNOW WHERE YOUR ATTORNEY LIVES AND I CAN TAKE CARE OF HIM." SCOTT'S FRUSTRATION WITH THE CUSTODY BATTLE WAS THREATENING TO TURN VIOLENT. IT APPEARED TO US THAT SCOTT REYNOLDS WAS SOMEBODY WHO WANTED ULTIMATE CONTROL OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY AND THAT HE SAW THAT MELISSA WAS TAKING THAT CONTROL OUT OF HIS HANDS. WITH SCOTT NOW BACK UNDER SUSPICION, THE POLICE ARE EAGER TO SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN. BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE WAS. AND WE KNOW WHAT HIS TOTAL FOCUS ON LUKE. SO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IN DESPERATION HE MAY SNATCH LUKE AND JUST TAKE OFF. THE CHIEF OF POLICE TOLD US THAT WE NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE, GO TO ONE OF THE HOTELS, GET A HIGH-FLOOR ROOM UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME. AND HE SAYS WE'LL HAVE POLICE PROTECTION THERE 24/7. INVESTIGATORS RETURN TO EVE BARGER'S HOUSE TO SEE IF SHE'S HEARD FROM SCOTT. TAKE A SEAT. SHE CLAIMS SHE HASN'T SEEN HIM SINCE THE WEEKEND HE STAYED AT HER HOUSE. MIND IF WE GO THROUGH THE EVENTS OF SATURDAY NIGHT AGAIN? EVE REPEATS THE SAME STORY, THAT SCOTT SPENT THE NIGHT WITH HER. THEN TOOK HIS STEPSON HUNTING WITH HIM AT DAWN. SCOTT HAD BORROWED SOME OF EVE'S GUNS TO HUNT DEER WITH. MIND IF WE TAKE A LOOK? SURE. SHE HAD TWO OR THREE LONG GUNS, HUNTING WEAPONS, AND SHE HAD A COUPLE OF PISTOLS. EVE TELLS THE DETECTIVES SHE KEEPS A .32 CALIBER PISTOL IN THE GREEN RANGE BAG. THERE IS NO GUN IN HERE. WHAT? IT'S ALWAYS IN THERE. EVE CLAIMED THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE'D NOTICED THE .32 PISTOL BEING MISSING. NOW WE HAVE A WEAPON THAT MATCHED THE PROJECTILES WE FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE AND IN MELISSA'S BODY. IT WAS A DEFINITE FLASHING RED LIGHT THAT, HEY, WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. EVE'S CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE TBI LAB AND THEN THEY CONDUCTED A SEARCH OF IT. THEY FOUND TWO .32 CALIBER ROUNDS INSIDE EVE'S CAR. THAT'S A HUGE MOMENT. EXPERTS CONFIRM THE BULLETS IN EVE'S CAR MATCHED THOSE FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE. WELL, THAT WAS AS GOOD AS HAVING THE GUN. THAT WOULD NARROW THE SUSPECT LIST DOWN TO WHOEVER HAD ACCESS TO EVE'S CAR WHICH WOULD'VE PROBABLY BEEN EITHER HERSELF, AND SCOTT REYNOLDS. POLICE LAUNCH A FULL SEARCH OF EVE'S PROPERTY. EVE BARGER LIVED IN LEWISBURG, TENNESSEE OVER AN ISOLATED AREA. LIVING IN A RURAL SETTING, YOU EITHER HAVE TO HAUL YOUR OWN GARBAGE OFF OR BURN IT. SO EVE HAD A BURN BARREL TO BURN THE TRASH. WE FOUND SOME RIVETS FROM A PAIR OF JEANS AND WE FOUND PART OF A WRANGLER LABEL. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THIS WAS USED? SUNDAY. SUNDAY LAST? YEAH, SCOTT USED IT. WHEN WE TALKED TO EVE, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS SCOTT WEARING WHEN HE CAME UP THERE? SCOTT WAS WEARING WRANGLERS WHEN HE CAME UP. AND WHEN HE WENT HOME SUNDAY, HE WASN'T WEARING WRANGLERS. HE WEARING A PAIR OF KHAKIS. POLICE NOW BELIEVE MISSY WAS KILLED BY EITHER SCOTT OR EVE. THEY JUST NEED TO PROVE IT. DETECTIVES HAVE DISCOVERED EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS SCOTT AND EVE ARE LYING ABOUT THE NIGHT MELISSA WAS MURDERED. THE PRESSURE IS MOUNTING AND IT'S LONG BEFORE ONE OF THEM CRACKS. MS. BARGER, HOW ARE YOU DOING? EVE CAME IN AND I HAD A PHOTO OF MISSY AND SHE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE AND SHE STARTED CRYING. IT'S ABOUT THAT NIGHT. THE NIGHT MELISSA WAS MURDERED. AND SHE SAID, "I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING." I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THE NIGHT THAT MISSY DIED. SCOTT DID WAKE ME, BUT I CAN'T BE CERTAIN OF THE TIME. EVE? EVE? I'M TAKING TANNER OUT TO DEER'S DEN. WATCH LUCAS FOR ME. - OKAY. - OKAY. THEN LUKE WOKE UP A LITTLE LATER. HE WANTED TO SEE HIS DADDY. I STAYED UP WITH LUKE UNTIL SCOTT CAME HOME. SHE SAID HE GOT IN BED AND HE WAS STILL DRESSED IN HIS JEANS AND HIS SHIRT. AND HE STARTED SOBBING. SCOTT? AND SHE'S, LIKE, "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?" WHAT'S WRONG? I CAN'T TELL YOU. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T TELL ME? YOU'LL HATE ME. NO, OF COURSE I WON'T HATE YOU. SCOTT, WHAT'S WRONG? HE SAID, "I JUST KILLED MELISSA." WHAT? AND THEN HE JUST CAME OUT AND TOLD ME HE KILLED MELISSA. HE OUTRIGHT CONFESSED TO YOU? YES. THE NEXT DAY WE WOKE UP AND HE ACTED LIKE NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. THAT'S A HARD POSITION FOR HER TO BE IN. THIS IS A GUY THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH, OR THOUGHT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH. AND NOW SHE'S GOT TO PROTECT HIM OR TURN HIM IN. HE WAS JUST PRETENDING LIKE EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL. HE TOOK THE BURN BARREL OUT AND BURNED SOME TRASH. DID YOU SEE WHAT EXACTLY HE WAS BURNING? NO, I DIDN'T. THE DETECTIVES ARE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE TIMING OF EVE'S CONFESSION. I WAS A BIT AGGRAVATED AT THE FACT THAT EVE HAD LIED TO US AND HAD NOT COME FORTH THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAD TALKED TO HER. THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NOT TELLING US EVERYTHING INITIALLY WAS CONCERNING. COULD SHE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED AND NOW SHE'S TRYING TO GET HERSELF OUT OF IT? I THOUGHT, WELL, IF HE'S CONFESSED TO YOU ONCE, WILL HE TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT AGAIN AND CAN WE GET IT ON TAPE? - ARE YOU IN TOUCH WITH SCOTT? - YES. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS? HE WON'T TELL ME. EVE, WE WANT YOU TO RECORD YOUR CALLS. WE NEED HIM TO CONFESS. IF SHE REFUSED, THEN IT MIGHT'VE BEEN AN INDICATION THAT SHE HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE MURDER THAN SHE WAS INITIALLY SAYING. WHEN YOU'RE READY. WE HAD HER ATTEMPT TO CALL HIM RIGHT THERE WHILE SHE WAS IN OUR OFFICE AND TRY TO MAKE CONTACT. I WAS VERY SCARED AT THAT POINT. KNOWING WHAT I KNEW, I WAS AFRAID THAT HE WOULD OBVIOUSLY TRY TO COME BACK AND DO SOMETHING TO ME. BUT I KNEW THAT I COULD DO IT. AND I HAD TO. I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF IF I DIDN'T DO THAT. OBVIOUSLY HIM REFUSING TO SAY WHERE HE WAS AND COMMENTING THAT SOMETHING'S GOING ON, HE KNEW WE WERE ON TO HIM. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE TAPE RECORDINGS, THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE TO RULE HER COMPLETELY OUT AND AGAIN SHINE THE LIGHT BACK ON MR. SCOTT REYNOLDS. BUT DESPITE EVE'S BEST EFFORTS, SCOTT SAYS NOTHING INCRIMINATING. POLICE GIVE EVE A RECORDER SO SHE CAN CONTINUE TAPING THEIR CALLS. THE GOAL WAS TO GET TO THE TRUTH AND BY GETTING EVE ON THE PHONE WITH SCOTT, IT WAS GOING TO COME OUT. HELLO? I REMEMBER FEELING I JUST WISH HE WOULD SAY THE WORDS SO IT COULD BE OVER. SCOTT REYNOLDS IS A WANTED MAN, BUT HIS WHEREABOUTS ARE STILL UNKNOWN. HIS GIRLFRIEND, EVE BARGER, CONTINUES TO RECORD HIS PHONE CALLS IN THE HOPE THAT HE WILL FINALLY CONFESS ON TAPE. AND I MEANT THAT, YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST. BE HONEST. BE TRUTHFUL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME DAY YOU WILL HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SON. I FELT MORE OF LIKE A THERAPIST IN THAT MOMENT 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY HE WAS BREAKING DOWN. I WANTED HIM TO SAY IT. I WANTED TO GET IT ON THE TAPE. I REMEMBER FEELING I JUST WISH HE WOULD SAY THE WORDS SO IT COULD BE OVER. THAT'S A DEFINITE CONFESSION. THAT'S THE NAIL IN HIS COFFIN AS FAR AS THE CASE WAS CONCERNED. SCOTT IS STILL IN HIDING, BUT DETECTIVES HOPE THEY CAN LURE HIM OUT WITH THE ONE THING HE VALUES ABOVE ALL ELSE... CUSTODY OF HIS SON, LUCAS. MELISSA'S LAWYER HAD SET THE MOTION TO COMPEL AGAINST SCOTT. SO I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO MAKE THAT COURT APPEARANCE. I WANTED HIM TO SHOW UP. I WANTED HIM TO BE THERE SO WE COULD ARREST HIM. HEY, SCOTT. HEY, SCOTT. I NEED TO TELL YOU I'VE GOT A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. HE DIDN'T FIGHT. HE DIDN'T ARGUE. SCOTT IS CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE PREMEDITATED MURDER. AT THE TRIAL, THE PROSECUTION PRESENTS ITS CASE OF A PLAN THAT BEGAN UNFOLDING LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AT EVE'S HOUSE. SCOTT PLANNED IT OUT AHEAD OF TIME. HE WENT TO EVE'S FULLY WELL INTENDING TO GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND SLIP OUT. WITH THE HOUSEHOLD ASLEEP, SCOTT TAKES THE .32 PISTOL AND EVE'S CAR KEYS. IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT, HE DRIVES 50 MILES TO MELISSA'S HOUSE. BEFORE YOU GO INTO THE HOUSE TO SHOOT SOMEBODY, YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A BULLET IN THE CHAMBER AND THE WAY YOU WOULD DO THAT WOULD BE TO PULL THE SLIDE BACK. IF THERE'S A BULLET ALREADY IN THE CHAMBER, IT WILL BE EJECTED AND ANOTHER WILL LOAD. TWO BULLETS EJECTED, ONE BY THE SEAT AND ONE IN THE BOOT OF THE GEAR SHIFT. SCOTT HEADS FOR THE HOUSE LEAVING TWO VITAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE BEHIND HIM. HE SNEAKS IN THROUGH THE OPEN BACK DOOR. AND BRUTALLY EXECUTES THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD. I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE WAS LEFT ON THE BED IN THAT MANNER. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY SEXUAL CRIME, BUT I THOUGHT THAT EITHER HE WAS TRYING TO STAGE THE CRIME SCENE TO LOOK LIKE SOMETHING MORE HAD HAPPENED THAN DID OR IT WOULD BE A WAY TO HUMILIATE HER. TO LEAVE HER POSED THAT WAY. POLICE SUSPECT SCOTT RETURNED TO EVE'S AND TOOK TANNER HUNTING AS AN ALIBI FOR HIS ACTIONS EARLIER THAT NIGHT. MR. REYNOLDS, YOU'VE BEEN CHARGED BY DETECTIVE RALPH MAYERCHIK IN A FIRST-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEATH OF MELISSA ATKIN ON OR ABOUT... SCOTT IS A VERY SELFISH INDIVIDUAL. HE WANTED LUCAS FOR HIMSELF AND HE WAS WILLING TO END MELISSA'S LIFE TO TRY TO GET WHAT HE WANTED AND INSTEAD HE KILLED MELISSA, HE SCARRED LUCAS FOR LIFE, AND THEN ENDED UP IN PRISON HIMSELF. SCOTT IS FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE FIRST-DEGREE AND SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. HE DENIED EVER THREATENING MELISSA'S ATTORNEY, BUT HIS INCARCERATION CAN NEVER GIVE BACK WHAT HE TOOK FROM MISSY'S LOVED ONES. WE TALK. SHE DOESN'T ANSWER, BUT I TALK. I TELL HER WHAT LUKE'S DONE, HOW HE IS, AND HOW TALL HE IS. LUCAS IS MY ROCKSTAR. WE'VE HAD HIM SINCE MISSY DIED AND HE WAS HALFWAY THROUGH KINDERGARTEN AND HE'S NOW 10th GRADE AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF HIM. HE'S A GOOD BOY. NOW 16, LUCAS IS AWAITING HIS 18th BIRTHDAY WHEN HE WILL LEGALLY BE ABLE TO LOSE HIS FATHER'S SURNAME AND BECOME LUCAS ATKIN. ON THE 16th OF DECEMBER, THE DAY SHE DIED, A LOT OF THE FAMILY COMES TOGETHER, FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY, AND WE JUST SPEND THE ENTIRE DAY BEING TOGETHER, EATING, JUST KIND OF BEING WITH EACH OTHER TO REMEMBER HER. AND HE IMAGINES THE WORDS HE WOULD SAY TO HIS MOTHER TODAY. PROBABLY I LOVE YOU 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK I GOT TO SAY THAT.
