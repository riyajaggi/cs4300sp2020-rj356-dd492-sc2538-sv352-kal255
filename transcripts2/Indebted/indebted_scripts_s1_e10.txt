 You hear this, too, right? Or am I dead? Oh, I think you proved this morning that you are very much alive. Just gonna ignore that. Aren't either of you gonna answer it? I mean, I would, but it's not my house. I don't like to overstep. Yeah, you hate overstepping. Well, it sounds like somebody wants to come in. - Rebecca, you go. - I'm sorry. I'm really deep into this Instagram

 where a kitten and bird are friends. Let me see! - Aw! - I know! Whoa! That kitten just ate that bird. Really? Neither of you are getting it? - Nope. - Not a chance. Well, it could be something important. Guys, if it was important, they would text me. No one answers the door anymore. If anyone's ringing your doorbell, it's not good. They either want you to sign something or buy something or tell you that the tree in your front lawn fell down onto something. I mean, I am a little intrigued.

 Who could it be? There's a pretty easy way to find out. He's right. The Ring app. What's a ding-dong app? "Ring" to "ding-dong"? That's a long walk, Ma. We got a camera on our doorbell so we can see... Oh, man, I'm getting the little circle thingy. Well, I guess we'll never know. - Hey! - Hey! - Ha, ha! - Hi. Quite the haul from the lemon tree today. I think we should give some maybe to Dani and Kris for their next party. Oh, or maybe Juan Pablo might want to use these to make his famous lemon bars. Okay, a couple of questions. One, we have a lemon tree? And, two, who the hell are these people you're talking about? Your neighbors! David, you don't know who your neighbors are? I never heard of such a thing. Of course I know my neighbors. Well, there's... there's "Ugly Plant House". There's "Airbnb House". There's "Divorce House". We call it "Divorce House" 'cause we're pretty sure they're getting a divorce 'cause no one mows their lawn over there. Well, I think you should know your neighbors. It's very important to interact with the people that live around you. That's how you create a community. Mom, I don't need a community. I got a commune... living in this house. Well, what happens - if you run out of sugar? - Instacart. Well, how do you know if there's a fire? The Nextdoor app. And smoke. What about the camaraderie? You know, having a beer at the block party, having a beer at the big game, having a beer during the eclipse! Sounds like you just want to have a beer. Can't it be both? It's just a generational difference. You know, people keep to themselves these days. Well, I think it's rude not to interact with your neighbors. And I think it's rude to interact with them. I mean, you're forcing them to do small talk. What's the matter with small talk? Everyone loves it. It's the smallest talk there is. Look, small talk leads to big talk, and big talk leads to hanging out. And no one has time to spend with a lady who's dressed like she's going to a ball and a grandfather who wanders up to a tree and just starts picking at it. Well, I do believe we've been insulted. Ha! Thanks for noticing my dress! It was on sale! It wasn't on sale! Can you believe we have a lemon tree? Yeah. Where do you think our lemons come from? The store? I don't know. What am I, a farmer? And also, you think we have, like, an okay relationship with our neighbors, right? Yeah. It's perfect. Close, but distant. That's what I thought. I think my parents just got in my head about it, but they're from a different generation, you know, where you had to rely on your neighbor 'cause you could get swept up in a dust bowl or whatever. Your timeline's way off, but sure. Although, the other day, I was getting the mail, and I gave the "Airbnb House" people a casual "'Sup?" head nod. Very cool. Very chill. Yeah, exactly. Very cool. Very chill. And they snubbed me. No nod! The audacity of "Airbnb House". Treat you that way. They're only here two-thirds of the year! They don't have the 'hood clout to snub me. I'm a year-round resident! You know, come to think of it, the other day, I was driving, and I saw "Ugly Plant House", and I gave them a little two-finger wave over the steering wheel. - Neighborly. - Nothing! - What?! - Snubbed! That's two snubbings in one week. Wait a minute. Do you think the neighbors are treating us this way because your parents are... the way they are? I mean, my parents are a strong cup of coffee. Yeah. More like three shots of espresso. They're more like four Four Lokos. I miss Four Loko. Stay on target, Tampa. Point is, you're right. We gotta nip this in the bud. I gotta go to Target. You brought it up. I'd like to talk to you guys for a second about something, and that just moved down the docket. What the [BLEEP]? Doesn't daddy look cute? The blue brings out the color of his eyes, and the stuffed toy brings out his cuddliness. Yeah! I'm watching the UConn game with Juan Pablo. Go Huskies! So, you, uh, forced yourself into a hang dressed like this? What? What are you talking about? Of course not. No, no, no. Juan Pablo knows how much I like college basketball, and I know how much he likes body painting. It's a win for everybody, except for you 'cause there's paint in your sink. Found my keys! Well, actually, they're your keys. - So, here you go. - Oh. Ooh, but that reminds me, I need to borrow your keys. Whoa. Why is dad dressed like Jew Man Group? Oh, our parents are friends with my neighbors, and this is what that looks like. You can't be friends with your neighbors! - You see? - What I meant to say is, you can't sleep with your neighbors. I mean, I can and do, but shouldn't. Well, we love your neighbors, and your neighbors love us. Not that we're sleeping with them, although we could if we wanted to. But we started a very nice wine club. - A wine club? - Yeah. Yes. And the first meeting is tomorrow at Juan Pablo's. Kris and Dani are coming, too. Kris and Dani? Who are those guys? They're women, David. Come on. It's the '90s. It is so very much not. You know them as "Divorce House", but they're actually very happily gay-married. Okay, "A", don't say "gay-married". And, "B", you have gay married neighbors who are starting a wine club?! This is, like, the best thing that's happened to me since those two Rottweilers recognized me in the grocery store. Joanna, I told you, they didn't recognize you. You were in the hot dog aisle. Who all goes to this thing? Everyone, David. Well, you could probably come yourself if you like. Yeah, they're my neighbors. I would assume that I would be invited first. There's gonna be a neighborhood wine club, and we're just finding out about it now? I guess so. Well, I mean, it combines my two favorite things... wine and clubs! You are peak Florida lately. Dave, this is serious. I mean, first the snubbings, and now this? Are we, like, the neighborhood pariahs? Maybe my parents were right, you know? Maybe being part of a community is not a generational thing at all but actually a really important part of life. Well, I mean, now that you're saying it out loud, it kind of feels like a no-brainer. And like something I've heard throughout the years on "Sesame Street". Okay, was it wrong to keep our neighbors close but distant? It seemed so cool and so chill. It's very cool, very chill. - Yeah. - As established. So, I didn't even want to hang out with our neighbors, but now that I find out that they're hanging out without us, it's all that I want to do. You know, it's like the Ice Bucket Challenge. We made fun of that a ton, but when no one challenged us, we felt terrible. Like we're not good enough to help find a cure for ALS? I know what we gotta do. Yep. You get the bucket, I'll get the ice. What? No. That was like five years ago. We're gonna go meet our neighbors at the wine club. - That was five years ago? - Yeah. - We're so old. - I know. Okay, so, we talked, and we want to go to the wine club and be friends with our neighbors and be part of a community. - Aw! - You are part of a community. - Thanks, Joanna. - The dumb idiot community. - Worth it! - Don't tease them. I'm thrilled you're coming. Take the wine. Let's go. I'm actually excited. Yeah. We're gonna hang out with our neighbors. Ah, you're gonna love it. Especially Rebecca. You're constantly drinking. I wouldn't say "constantly". Right, but more than most. Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Oh, uh, by the way, it's 67 degrees, in case anyone wants to make any small talk. - Hey! - Hi. Hey! Come... Come on in. - Hi. - Hi! - There he is! - Hey! Hi, everyone. - Hi. - There he is. Uh, hey, uh, Rebecca, Dave, this is Juan Pablo, okay? Rebecca, Dave, Dani and Kris. Hi! Well, Rebecca brought two bottles of wine. One and a half. I-I started one on the way over. She's excited. And from Florida. Oh! I'm from Daytona! So, uh, what got infected first, your belly-button ring or your tongue ring? Um, actually, it was my eyebrow ring. - Ya burnt! - Oh! - Bonefish Grill! - Publix! I hate this conversation. So, your mom tells me you're a contractor and have sexy lips. You've been hanging out with my mom a lot recently? No, that's how she introduced herself to me. Can we talk for a second? Yeah. - What's up? - We need your help. Your parents are driving us nuts. Hi! - They've been all over us. - Wait, what? Your dad came over to watch the game with body paint on. I thought it was just on his face, but he showed me it went way lower. Well, so, if they're bothering you, why did you start wine club? I didn't! I was unloading groceries, your mom walked by and saw a wine bottle, and yelled, "Wine club!" And here we are. I knew it! This is making a lot of sense. Please help. I mean, your dad is always cornering us at our mailbox and rambling about Abraham Lincoln. I'm pretty sure he's high. So, this is why you guys have been snubbing us, because Deb and Stew were bothering you. We were trying to send subtle messages. So you don't want a tight-knit community? No. I mean, we don't even answer our doorbell. We just want what we had. Close, but distant. - Yes. - Yes! Exactly! We'd be so close if we didn't want to be so distant! Your parents are very nice people, but they are always in our space. You can't imagine. - Oh. - Yeah. We can imagine. We'll talk to them. Okay. Four score and seconds from now, this beautiful lady's gonna make an announcement that you're gonna love. Next wine club party at our house! - Friday! Huh?! - Yeah! She means our house. They live in our house. Ooh! Juan Pablo. My friend Maddy Wang's daughter... I'm gonna invite her for you. She's almost recovered from her shingles. What is she saying? My mom wants you to make love to a woman with adult chickenpox. No one wants community with their neighbors! - Why did we ever doubt ourselves? - Yeah, call me crazy, but now that I know the neighbors don't want to be close - makes me feel so close to them. - I know! I feel kind of warm and fuzzy all over. Although, it might be from the Florida talk. We call it trash bonding. The rest of the country is right. Florida is cuckoo bananas. Let's get back to how my parents - were so wrong... - I know! ...and how no one's gonna come to this wine club party! Ohh! Yeah. We owned them so hard. I can't wait to tell them how wrong they were. Yeah! Oh, le... Yeah, let's do it... Let's do it to their faces! Hi, you two. We'd like to talk to you about your little wine club. Tup, tup. One sec. Mommy is still talking to her Bubbie. I did it, Bubbie. You can rest now. What is happening? David, I want to tell you something that I've never told you before. Oh, great. Now's the time. When Bubbie was on her deathbed, she made me promise her something... that my children will always know community. And today I am fulfilling her wish. - Hmm. - But wasn't her dying wish also for you to name your first-born son Azriel? It's Joanna's middle name. It's good enough, Stew. Community was the main thing. You know, when the Cossacks raid your village enough times, you begin to realize what's important, what's a priority. Yeah, I just didn't realize you guys held community so near to your hearts or that Bubbie did, either. Well, we do, and everybody does. It's very important. We know we've been a burden to you, but you've given so much to us, and it just makes us happy to know that we've given something back... community. Yes. Alright, enough with the mushy stuff. Now, you wanted to talk about wine club? Um, yeah, yeah, just make sure to get enough Pinot Grig. Oh! Okay, Rebecca. I love when you tease me! I know what we must do. We got to move. Or we could convince all the neighbors to come to the party? - Yeah, that's way less stressful. - Yeah. Let's do that. Hey! Oh, I thought it was Postmates. I know that, uh, my parents invited you to yet another wine night. Yeah. We got the 11 Evites. Oh, and one Paperless Post. Look, I know no one wants to go to this, but we'd really appreciate it if you did. Yeah. A-And their hearts are in the right place. Have you heard of the Cossacks? Are they the ones around the corner who run the illegal swim class? It doesn't matter. You know, it's just my parents... apparently, this means a lot to them. So if you could just make it to our house for wine club, it'll only be this once. Yeah, and if you don't come for us, do it for the spray cheese I bought. - I got you, Daytona. - Hmm? - Alright, fine, we're gonna come. - Oh. Do you guys want any more Brie? How much longer do we need to stay? We were hoping to go to a movie. Just like a half-hour or so. I-I don't want it to seem suspicious, you know? And then I promise this whole ordeal will be behind us. Uh, D-Dave, what's the deal with this neighborhood? It's... It's all couples, no singles? No one brought a friend? It's kind of a rude community. It's suburban Connecticut, not Tinder. And it never will be with that attitude. And they say that he might have had Marfan syndrome. I-I'm sorry. Who... Who are we talking about? Lincoln! Alright, I'll start from the beginning. - Oh, no, sweetie. - Now, Illinois... Sweetie, I don't think that he wants to hear any more about old dead men. I think what he wants to hear about is young single women. - Ah. - Right?! Speaking of, my girlfriend's daughter Wendy Wang is here, and she's single, shingled, and ready to mingle! Nope! Can't do it! - Dave! - Yeah? What's up, man? Are you guys out of cheese? I took down one can, but there's more. Uh, no to all of that. Look, I-I can't keep pretending I want to be here. I have to go. - What's he talking about? - Wait, is he leaving? Because if he is, we really want to make it to that movie. Oh, what movie? I love movies. 3-D? 2-D? No-D? No big "D". Okay, can we leave? I feel like we held up our end of the bargain. Bargain? What bargain? How do I put this gently? We don't want to be here. Not exactly gently, but that is the headline, Dad. Yeah, not everyone is as jazzed about wine club and being part of a community. Oh. I see. Well, maybe it is a generational thing, because when we were younger, in the good times, we celebrated with our neighbors. And in the hard times, we leaned on them. And all the other times, we got buzzed with our neighbors. I'm very sorry that I tried to bring you all together, like some kind of a gorgeous, raven-haired Mister Rogers. Okay. That woman... is the beautiful day in this neighborhood! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! I'm gonna run this up there 'cause he'll be back down for it. Hey. Mom, Dad, are you guys okay? - My pride is hurt, but we'll be fine. - Oh. The wine party may have been kind of a bust, but we appreciate what you were trying to do. Oh, it was a bust. It was a huge bust! Bubbie, I failed you! No, it... Bubbie, we're fine. The point is, you did help us, you know? At first, we didn't even know our neighbors' names, and now we do. Yeah, and actually, they seem kinda cool. I could see being friends with them. Oh, you're just saying that 'cause you don't want to be haunted by Bubbie. Yes, but also, uh, we may not be as close with our neighbors as you'd like us to be, but we have our own community... ...right here. - Yeah. - Oh. And you like my Lincoln stories way more, anyway, right? Yeah. Sure. Well, let's go downstairs and drink some wine. - She wants more wine. - Mm. - What? - Nothing. You're gorgeous. Whoa. Wow. So, uh, you guys are still here? Yeah. You know, a lot of what your mom said made sense. Community's important. Yeah, it's nice to have good neighbors. And you guys remind me of my parents. - Oh. - Ridiculous, but I love them. Us, too. Very, very much. I'm a family girl. Tell your friends. That's okay. You know, we've decided to stay, too, because there's free wine and we missed our movie. You got any more of that spray cheese? We did it, Bubbie! What? She's talking to my dead great-grandmother. Just get out of here before you get shingles. Aah! We're out of soy sauce! Oh, I'll just text Juan Pablo. That guy is swimming in soy sauce. You know, I'm worried about his blood pressure. Uh, well, don't be. He's taking medication for it. I took a gander at his medicine cabinet. I still can't believe Kris and Dani couldn't find someone to set me up with. I have seven dogs, and my bed is by the fridge. It's, like, the best life. Davey, where are we with the soy sauce? My mu-shu's feeling naked. Mm! Maybe that's him right now. - Mm. - I got the Ding-Dong app. Let me see. Oh, yeah, it's Juan Pablo. Hi, Juan Pablo! Hey, I'll leave the soy sauce at the door. Keep it neighborly. Aw, you're the best! Juan Pablo in the house! Or Juan Pablo right outside the house! Hey, see you around the neighborhood. Okay, thanks, sweetie! We're the best neighbors.
