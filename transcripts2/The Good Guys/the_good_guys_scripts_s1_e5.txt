 Do you see the man who was driving the truck In this courtroom? Y-yeah. That guy right there. Let the record indicate Detective Stark has pointed out the defendant, Mr. Wayne Young. And he is the one that you pulled over on the 12th? Am I under oath? Yes. I would appreciate it if you would stop asking that question. Is Mr. Young the one that you pulled over on the 12th? Uh... He was, uh, driving a, uh, pickup truck With a plate that was stolen off a dump truck in waco. So I-I busted him...For drivin'...With stolen plates.

 No further questions, your honor. Detective, how exactly did you get the information That the plates were stolen off of a dump truck in waco? A-am I still under oath? You are still under oath, yes. I didn't know if we had to do it again. Isn't it true that you used, shall we say, Unconventional methods to obtain this information? We have subpoenaed a surveillance video Of you questioning Mr. Young's business partner. But maybe you could save us all some time, Detective, And just tell us what happened. What? What?! You know what this is, you son of a bitch?! What? It's a bomb. You've got 30 seconds To tell me what you know about Wayne Young's truck, Or you're gonna lose everything South of your belt buckle. It wasn't really a bomb. You just -- you take the back off a transistor radio And it looks kind of, you know, Bomb-ish. It was kind of like A "no blood, no foul" kind of thing. "no blood, no foul" Is hardly legal doctrine, Detective. Even claiming to possess a bomb is a clear physical threat, An egregious violation of due process. I think your shirt is egregious. Your honor, we move for a dismissal. Look, Liz, I don't know what to say here. He is your partner, Jack. And I fail to see How you could allow him to leave out The bomb-down-the-pants part of his story! Wh-- I didn't know. Are you asking me to predict the behavior of a man Who uses his service revolver to open a mayonnaise jar? That's not good enough, Jack. We've been trying to take down Wayne Young for years. L-liz, I -- Jack, what are you gonna say? I need to be alone. You want a chip? No, I don't want a chip, Dan. You sure? They're barbecue. I think the -- the dust they put on it Makes you feel better. You blew the case, Dan -- Not just our case, The one that I spent a week filing the paperwork for, But the state's case. You mean your ex-girlfriend's case. Don't worry. We'll get him next time. No. There isn't going to be a next time, Dan. They're shutting down the investigation. That means no more department resources. Department resources? Back in the day, We didn't need department resources. Frank and me would hit the street! And what? Fight crime with pointed sticks and rocks? You need resources to run an investigation. Tell you what. I'll take him down with the cash in my pocket -- Three dollars... And... 52 cents. Good luck with that. You watch. Wayne will be back in jail Before the ink on his release papers is dry. Y'all have a nice day, now. See you in hell. There he is. Thought you might be missing this. Damn right. Hey, you got any of that cigarette gum? I ain't been thinkin' straight Since I gave up cancer sticks. There we go. All right, we got to run a couple errands. First, I got to pick me up a shotgun. Y-you got this all wrong! You're misunderstanding the situation! Yeah? 'cause I think the situation's real clear. Some cop put a transistor radio down your pants, And you rolled over on me, paco. As soon as he did that, I knew that anything I said was gonna get thrown out of court. I-it w-was like a strategy... To get you out of jail! Please! Wait! Just listen to me! I got a deal goin' -- w-while you were in the joint. It's a deal for both of us. What kind of deal? It's a brick of "h." It's straight out of South America. I brought it in on one of our trucks. I got a buyer lined up and everything. And that's just the start. If this works, we bring in more bricks. Wayne, we're so close on this! You meet the guy, we make delivery. What about the cops? T-they can't come pick you up the day after you get out! The cops aren't gonna be doing anything! I'm telling you, man -- we're gonna be getting rich While the cops are sitting around eating donuts! Aah! Hard day? Yeah. Is it a girl, or is it work? Well, it's... It's both, actually. My ex-girlfriend hates me, And my partner at work might be... Mildly insane. Well, usually the answer to girl trouble Is to do something mildly insane. Put your problems together. Maybe you've got something. All right, Detective Bailey. You're gonna need that second donut. Hello. Hey, Dan. Hey. What's up? I want to know if you're really serious About taking Wayne down, Aside from the whole $3.52 thing. Hell, yeah. Why? I'm gonna go talk with Liz in the morning about it. Uh, yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. You go for it. Are you okay? You sound winded. I'm -- I'm joggin'. I got to call you back. Freeze! Okay! Okay. Freeze! I'm froze! I'm froze! Look. I'm not moving, okay? Man...Why you got to hassle me? Julius... The relationship between a Detective and a snitch Is a sacred bond. And when you don't return my calls, You make me chase you out of parking garages, You violate that sacred bond. Listen -- I got like three warrants out for my arrest. Calling back cops is not really on my to-do list. That's what I want to talk to you about. How would you feel if all those warrants went away? Wait -- are you serious? Like, "went away," like, "Julius, you don't have to go to prison" went away? Uh, because that sounds appealing to me. "went away," like, "you put an ankle bracelet on And you're on probation" go away. I'm your man. Let's lay it on me. I need to know about a guy named Wayne Young. I know him. I know Wayne Young. Oh, I don't know him, know him, But I do know people that know him. If I could just-- emm, can I put my hands -- What do you want? I just want to get some paper and a pen and write down -- Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Okay -- Wayne Young. He got a place, uh, down on oakwood, okay? And that's it right there. That make us good? We put him in jail... We're good. Okay. Ca-- do I have to be still? Or can I move? 'cause I want to hug you right now. You can hug me. I can hug you? Sure. All right. Thank you. Thank you so much, man. I'm not gonna let you down. Weird. Weird. Feels weird. Oh, okay. All right. You smell like a... Like a man. Okay. Okay. Walk away. Okay. Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com What can I do for you, Jack? I-I-I just came by to apologize again For Dan tanking your big case. Well, since y'all are partners, I guess you both tanked my case... Technically. Yeah, listen -- about that, um... I want to make this right. I want to go after Wayne. Now, I was talking with Dan, and, uh -- After what Dan did, You're gonna have to catch him in the act Committing a major felony. That means doing everything by the book -- Not really your partner's strong suit. Matter of fact, I might just leave him at home on this one. Don't worry about it. Just fill me in on the case against Wayne -- His full history, just something That I can go after him with. Fine. Provided you leave my office immediately So that I can get some work done, I will meet you at your office at 6:00. You having fun reading your files, Or you ready to go bust this punk? Look, I hate to blow your mind, But in these files are pieces of paper. And if you read them, They actually tell you things about the case. Oh, yeah? Read this file. Wayne's working out of a garage in East Dallas. Runs it through some kind of Shell company. Okay. It's nice. But what do we bust him for? Figure it out when we get there. No, Dan. If we're gonna bust Wayne, We have to do things by the book. Fine -- you want to do it by the book, we'll do it by the book. We'll go there and do a whatchamacallit -- A "preliminary investigation." Yeah, that'll work. By the way, How did you find out where Wayne was operating? Am -- am I still under oath? This is the place. Hello?! Hello? That's weird. What do you say we go in there and check out that truck? W-whoa -- whoa -- maybe I wasn't clear About the whole "by the book" thing. Searching a place without a warrant -- That's not in the book, Dan. Well, how about this? Secondary exits must be unlocked During business hours. I say, as officers of the law, It is our duty... To enter the premises and cite the owner. Hit him with a city violation? Besides, they should know their security is terrible. Plus, nobody should be allowed back here without a hard hat. You mean like us? Hey, it's a violation. We should tell the owner about it Right after we ding him For that improperly secured propane tank. Y-you know, that's not really in the spirit Of what I was saying, Dan. Well, it's legal, doesn't cost more than $3.52, So it works for me. See, the law is like a woman -- She slaps you, doesn't do any good to get mad. It just makes it worse. A little sweet talk, Before you know it, you're covered with baby oil, Whipped cream on your nipples -- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. I get it. What is this place? What are they shipping here? There's no way to tell, but -- Well, maybe we'd better check out that truck, Make sure their cargo is properly secured. No, wait. Dan, wait! I've got to call l. Hey, Jack. What's up? Uh, listen -- I'm gonna be a little late For our meeting. Why? What's wrong? Oh, no, no. I-it's nothing. It's just, um... You sound like a 14-year-old Trying to hide a girlie magazine. Sorry, Liz. Uh, l-listen. C-can we meet at 6:30? Is that okay? That's fine. I'll see you then. Okay. Thanks. Dan, what are you doing? Dan, we can't be in here. Why not? Looks illegal. What part of this looks illegal to you, Dan? All right? This is a truck filled with boxes. Yeah. Boxes full of crime. Oh. Okay. Well, that's a good one for the report. "Detective Stark made a visual inspection And determined that the boxes were filled with crime." Come on. We're on the five-yard line. I can feel it tinglin' in my loins! That's another gem for the report. Listen, Dan. We are off to a great start here, okay? Now, if we can just determine That this is Young's place of business, Then we've got a pretty good case For probable cause, but not if w-- Did you hear somethin'? Yeah, I heard that -- sounds like a door. Start her up. I'll get the back. Dan, this is an illegal search, all right?! Now, if we get caught, we are in serious trouble! Your phone is ringing. God! I hate this. Hello. Hey, Detective Dan. This is Julius, man. How is the, uh, parole deal coming? Hey, I can't talk right now. I'm in the back of Wayne Young's truck. W-wait -- w-what are you doing In the back of one of Wayne Young's trucks? H-hello? Dan? It's a long story. T-there's men with big guns, and -- it's beepin'. I can't hear anything. But it's beepin'. What does that mean? No. No, no, no. This cannot be happening to me. I got to hand it to you, paco. Looks like it's working out real good. Aren't you glad you didn't blow my head off with that shotgun? Just a little misunderstanding between partners, right? Yeah. Come on. Let's go make some money. Oh, God. It's moving. The truck is moving. Oh, God, I cannot believe I let you talk me into this. Yeah, I can't either. Damn! Oh, Skeeter. Skeeter! My man. What the hell?! Thank you for coming. What's going on, man?! I got your call. I thought you were dying! I am dying, Skeeter. I'm like inches from dying. You look okay. Well, I'm not. Um, you know the parole deal that I made? Okay, the cop that I made the deal with is trapped in the back of one of Wayne Young's trucks. What?! I know. There's no trucks in there! I know, Skeeter. That's what I'm saying. Look, if this cop dies, man, I'm going to jail for like five years. And these are very big years In terms of my personal growth, okay? I mean, you know, I got a girlfriend in Jamaica. Maybe she moves back, we open up a b&b; someplace. Okay, yeah, and I'm here why? You introduced me to Wayne Young. Y'all are friends, so... No, no, no, no, no. "friends"? T-t-that would be a strong word. We're more like colleagues, dude. H-he takes weed up north for me sometimes. Okay, but you know him. You know him better than I do. All right, look -- Skeeter, baby, You got to find this truck, and you got to find it now, man. Look, I'll give you $500. $500?! What, are you out of your mind?! That guy's violent, dude! He -- he pulled a guy's thumbs off, man! H-he had, like, no -- just, like, fingers left! It was t-t-totally disgusting, dude! Okay. Okay. I will give you... My car. Ohhhhhhh! No, man. No! I like this car. Ohh! Comes with the stereo? Mm-hmm. You can have the stereo. And the rims? You can have the rims. You can have the stereo. You can have the floor mats. You can have the change in the ashtray, Skeeter. Just find the truck for me, okay?! I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man. All right, I'll help find the truck. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell at you. Still don't see why we need a whole 18-wheeler To move one little, ol' brick of heroin. That's the genius of it. They been amping up searches at the border, But, uh, they only do spot-checks, see? T-they don't check your whole cargo. Yeah, they might open up 1 box, you know, maybe 10, But trust me -- they ain't gonna open up 200. What the hell was that? Ain't you jumpy. It's the truck... Backfirin'. Sounds like we're on a two-lane highway In a flat, rural area. Dan, this is Texas, all right? You just described 10,000 square miles. Oh, God damn it! Are you insane?! Stop that! I'm trying to put a hole in the wall So the cellphone-wavey-thingys can get out. Dan, the phones aren't working Because these walls are made with reinforced steel. So if you shoot at them, The only thing you're gonna put a hole in...Is one of us! Okay. Fine. Then let's get these doors open so we can jump out. Oh, God. Yeah. That's a great idea. Why don't we jump out of a moving truck At 75 miles per hour and land on the asphalt. What's wrong with that? Physics, Dan. It's suicide. Not if you push off hard enough from the truck. It cancels out the speed of the truck. Look, it's like when you're in an elevator, And when it comes to a stop, You jump. I-I'll tell you what -- if you can get the door open, Why don't you just show me how it works, okay? Come on. Why are you acting like this is such a bad thing? We got Wayne Young right where we want him. Yeah. On a two-lane highway in a flat, rural area. Exactly. This is Detective Jack Bailey. Please leave a message, and I'll get right back to you. Well, it has been 45 minutes. Congratulations. You are officially on your way to becoming your partner. Still waiting on your boyfriend? Detective Bailey's not my boyfriend. And unless you want me asking my office To make you redo all those arrest reports In blue ink instead of black, I will thank you to keep your mouth shut about that. Oh, Jack. Wherever you are, I hope you are having fun. Okay, man. All I know is, it's down South somewhere. How you doin'? Thanks a lot. Oh. Man, what took you so long? Man, I'm, like -- I'm, like, freakin' out in this neighborhood. Dude, you asked me to find out about a criminal, all right? Most criminals live in areas With low median property values... And crime. Can we just focus, please? Where is the truck with the cop in it? West. West. What does -- I don't -- what does that mean? Well, it means that I talked to my buddy over there And he heard that Wayne and some other guy Are going out West on the interstate. He didn't know where, but it's definitely...Out... You know, that way. So I'm supposed to just drive that way? What's going on that way? I'm working on details. Oh, man, you -- All right, I-I-I guess they're doing a deal with some guy. "with some guy"? Man, you're killing me. You are absolutely killing me, man. Do you know anything else? I hear that he's kind of scary looking... And he's from another country. We can do the deal on thursday. No, I'm not English. I'm from South Africa. Yes, there are giraffes in South Africa. I will see you on Thursday. So, there's that. And that's it? For now. I figure, you head West on the interstate, I'll call you when I know more, man. No. No, no, no, no, no. You're coming with me. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Coming with you wasn't part of the initial agreement. Hey. Hey. I'm giving you my car, man. Okay? My car. Do you want my car or not? Yeah, I want the car. Thought so. Thank you. Have a good night. Man, you got weird taste in friends, man. Did you see his boots? Dude got some weird boots, man. I got him those boots! Man, what? You bought the dude some boots? Yeah. What else was I gonna do? I mean, w-we're partners, right? I mean, you would have done the same for me. Oh, sure thing. Sure thing. Got any other deals in the works? Anything else I should know about? I got a few things... Brewin'. Oh, man. Dan, what are you doing? I am trying to cut a hole with my knife So that the cellphone- wavey-thingys can run free, Because of your fear of the ricochet. You're trying to cut a hole in a bulletproof steel wall With a pocket knife. Good luck with that. I'll finish it later. What are you doing? Aside from trying not to get carsick? I...Am investigating Wayne Young's inventory. Thought you said those boxes Were filled with scented candles. Well, so far. I haven't opened all of them yet. Are you looking for a particular fragrance? Let me ask you something, Dan. What do you think is more likely -- That Wayne Young is opening a scented-candle shop, Or he's trying to hide something... Something that a drug-sniffing dog would be able to find. Like I said, these boxes are full of crime. Yeah, well... You mind helping me out here? Get a little more light on the situation. Mm... Mystic sunrise. It's natural. I love it. Don't die on me, Dan. Do not die on me, Dan. Do not die on me, Dan. Dude, will you shut up?! I'm trying to talk on the phone! Okay, okay. Uh-huh. Yeah. All right. Cool, man. Thank you. Okay. So, did you find out where the hell we're going? Sort of. My buddy heard that the deal's going down Tomorrow morning at 7:30 By the, uh... The -- the -- The "lil' tradin' post curio shop," by lubbock. The lil' tradin' -- w-w-what? I don't know, man. It's like a souvenir shop or somethin'. Also, um... Oh, God. Also what? What? What? What? What? What? What? I found out a little bit more about that South African guy. I guess he's doing some kind of big drug deal With Wayne Young, and I guess he... Bought a lot of guns. Perfect. I'm thinkin' maybe we should just turn around, Go home. Skeeter, if this cop dies, I'm sleepin' 18 inches from a metal toilet For the next half-decade, okay? Just focus on finding out where this deal is happening. And, Skeeter, when we get there, You look for the cop with the moustache, okay? Everybody can shoot each other up, But we save the moustache. Save the moustache. Save the moustache. The scent of these candles is getting to me. What? It smells like a mystic sunrise. Oh, God. I think I'm gonna puke. Well, if you're gonna puke, I'm gonna light more candles. No! No! No! Ooh, ooh! Look at you. I believe we have hit the... Jackpot. Give me that. This is 3 kilos, at least. It's heroin. It's heroin. It's -- it's high-density. It's, uh, small grains. It's probably, uh, central asian. Wow, you sure do know a lot about that heroin... Thank you. That heroin that we never would have found If I hadn't arranged to get us locked up together In the back of this truck. So, you're saying you planned this? I'm saying that bein' a cop is a team sport. It's you and me, Jack. You know, in the old days, we used to catch a bad guy -- We'd call all our buddies, we'd let him go, We'd catch him again, Just so we could bust him together. Are you serious? Yeah. We called it "catch, release, and catch again." Look, you got to understand the difference Between the good guys and the bad guys. Bad guys are just a bunch of guys runnin' around with guns. Good guys are a team of guys runnin' around with guns. You learn that, maybe you won't spend the rest of your career Working property crimes with Dan Stark. Thanks for the career advice. Hey, listen, Dan... What? The truck is stopping. Why the hell we get here so damn early? Waitin' for hours. We had to take the side roads just to be safe -- I told you. And why the hell did we pick a drop location way the hell out here? We're totally exposed. No, it's perfect. This little town is between districts. I mean, it's at least 100 miles to the nearest cop. There's no way we can get caught. Nobody even knows we're here. Mm-hmm. Oh. There we go. Oh. Shotgun? There's not gonna be any need for that. It's just in case. Hey, there. Don't worry about the guys with the guns. Mikkel likes to travel heavy, just in case. Oh, I ain't worried. Good to see you. Looks like we got a little business to conduct. Put the shotgun down. Get on your knees. Excuse me? I said, "get on your knees." Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there, cowboy. This ain't what we ta-- What the hell is going on?! Sorry, Wayne. I guess I forgot to mention Me and mikkel had sort of a side deal. Yeah, man. I got the product. So, how 'bout this -- we do the deal, Only... You kill Wayne. No more Wayne, it's win-win. I had a side deal, you stupid son of a bitch! How 'bout this -- we deliver the brick of heroin, I take care of paco, and all you got to bring is a shovel. Win-win. Exactly. What? You also. Get on your knees now. Okay. Okay. Uh, I think there's been some confusion here, In terms of the agreement. There is no confusion. How was the meeting? Both are unreliable. Best we, uh, kill them and take their product. Weasel son of a bitch. I should have killed you when I had the chance. Actually, maybe it would be better If you didn't try to kill me at all. The only reason we're in this situation Is because you were gonna shoot me. Oh, no -- the reason we're in this situation Is 'cause you talked to the cops like a damn weasel! Enough! Let's finish this now. Let's get the brick of heroin and get out of here. Open the truck. You smell that? Come on! Come on! Remember -- stick to the plan. There's only two of 'em. We got the element of surprise. We take 'em out with overwhelmin' force. Overwhelmin' force. Got it. Go! What the hell? You got a plan "b"?! Let's go! Shoot them! Traitor weasel son of a bitch! I'm not liking plan "b"! Little early for you to visit us, isn't it, counselor? I heard about the Dan Stark courtroom fiasco, And if you're here to tell me he's an idiot, Let me save you a little time. Actually, I'm not here about that -- Not directly, anyway. What is it? It's about j-- it's about Detective Bailey. Uh, we were supposed to meet To go over some evidence last night, And he never showed. Oh, he's probably fishing Dan out Of whatever hole he slept in last night. Check the steam vents at the Larson hospital And the urinals at the strip club. He usually passes out somewhere warm. If you don't mind my saying, lieutenant, I don't think that's where he is. I found an address on his desk last night, And I spent all night tracking it down, And it turns out that it belongs to a trucking company With ties to Wayne Young. Jamie, when's the last time Dan Stark or Jack Bailey checked in? Keep 'em coming! I got enough buckshot for all y'all! Hey! We had a deal! Afternoon. Looks like you're having a little bit of trouble out there. Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. I think we're all clear now. Don't ever say "all clear" again! Let's go! Who the hell are those two guys? I don't know, and I don't care. Just kill them and get me that brick. Cover me in the front. I got to call the lieutenant and call for backup. Lieutenant ruiz. Yes, lieutenant! This is Detective Bailey! You haven't checked in in the last six hours. Where the hell have you been?! It is a long story, all right? Just -- det-- Detective Stark and I need cover. Send 'em code 3 -- as many squads as you can! I'll get dispatch. No, no, no, no, no! We don't -- we don't need backup from, uh, from our substation Or -- or Dallas p.D. At all, for that matter. Uh... We're at the... The "lil' tradin' post curio shop." It's, uh... It's about -- damn it -- 30 minutes outside of lubbock. All right, now, we're under heavy fire! That's six hours away, Detective. What the hell are you doing out there? It is a long story, all right? Just send as many people as you can, all right? Hurry! All right, I'll get dispatch. And, Detective -- I'll want a full explanation Of how you came to be "under heavy fire" At the lil' tradin' post curio shop! Yes! And you will get it, lieutenant! Aah! I promise you that! We are so late, man. We are so late. The stupid deal was supposed to happen five minutes ago, man. Where is this place at? It should be right up here. Should be? Man, should be or is? Man, come on. I-it should be, dude. It's hard to tell. I-I-is it right here? Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. It's back that way. The road we just passed. This is not a safe way to drive! You know what? Learn to read a map. Then you comment on my driving. Backup's 20 minutes away, at least. At the rate we're going, We're gonna be dead in 10, give or take a minute or two. That sounds about right. We got to bring the bad guys to the backup. If they see us run out of here with this brick, They're gonna follow us. We'll meet up with the cavalry en route. That's a good idea, Dan. Or it would be, If we had any mode of transportation at all And we weren't getting shot at. Way ahead of you. Take a look! We'll take the red one. That a boy. You're gonna die, it might as well be in a hot rod! You ready?! I'm waiting for you to say "go." Let's go! Get in the car! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! I got it! Where are the keys?! How am I supposed to drive?! You don't know how to hot-wire a car?! What the hell they teach you at the academy? Get out! Aah! Go! Go, go, go, go! Son of a bitch! You! Is that your car? Give me the keys. You make this thing go any faster?! Got a small-block v-8 in this! Yeah, I know, but there's a reason Why it was sitting collecting dust In front of a souvenir shop, all right? The transmission's shot! I'm thinking maybe we should have took the sedan. You want some? Dan, when did you get a chocolate bar? I got it back at the shop when you were on the phone. I-it's got almonds... ...Nougat... It's kind of crispy. You sure you don't want a bite? Yeah. No. I'm not hungry right now! Maybe when we're finished Fleeing for our survival, all right?! Son of a bitch! I want that brick now! I'm thinking this isn't a very good situation anymore! What, you don't think I already know that?! Get some! Come on. Come on! Hang on. Oh. Nice! Nice. That's exactly what I would have done. That's what scares me. Nobody's movin'. I think we're all clear. No, I -- I told you, don't say that! You thought you were gonna get away with my heroin, You sons of bitches?! Are you seeing what I'm seeing? It seems to be a flaming truck of some sort. Quick! Go! Go! I'll grab the horse! Oh, no! I dropped it! Get down! Get down! Get down! You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. But I've been better. Yeah. Bastard! Gotcha! Oh, he's getting away with the heroin. Okay, we got to go after him. Come on. Jack. Partner, we got a bigger problem right here. Put down your guns. Where is the heroin? We don't have it. It's gone. You're lying! He's not lying. We left it in the middle of the road. "packo" ran off with it. Who are you? Why were you in the back of the truck? We're police officers. But I-I-if you just drop your weapon, All, right, we can talk this out. Cops? You're cops? Hey! You harm one hair on that man's moustache, And I will blow your brains all over this food stand. Are you kidding me? No. I'm not. Julius! You made it! Of course I made it, man. We had a deal, right? Wait -- w- a deal? What deal? I'll explain later. Can I hug you? Yes, you can hug me. Come on! All right. Here they come. You better get out of here. Okay. All right. Run. We got to go. We got to go. We got to go. Register your weapon! What the hell was that? We hugged. I'm a hugger. And then the other guy, the one in the cowboy hat -- He run off over there and he had a shotgun. Looked like a Walnut stock, 12 gauge. Anyway, he runs off over there... The freeway's still a complete mess. There's no sign of paco. I talked to the unis -- They think he ran off and caught a ride on a back road. And the brick of heroin? No sign of that, either. Looks like he got away with that, too. He didn't leave any friends behind, And Wayne Young has agreed to testify against him. And I believe his exact words were, "I'm gonna drag that little weasel to hell with me." Well, that's helpful. Yeah, but y-you know what's not so helpful? Blowing up a car And then getting in a major gun battle 10 counties away from your substation. So, next time you want to apprehend a suspect And it takes all this, Maybe you could just let me know, or something. Well, yeah. It wasn't really part of the plan. It just sort of evolved. Hm. Well, it was a hell of a drive out here, And I'm gonna get my butt chewed out For all the overtime, But...I'm real glad you're okay. You came all the way out here 'cause you were worried about me? No. I drove all this way to see Wayne Young in handcuffs. Oh. Right. Ah, but now that I'm here, I do...Owe you an apology For leaving you that voicemail about being late And turning into Dan. And...I was just real upset about my case, And I let it get in the way of me trusting you. So I'm sorry for that, Jack. Well, I stole a sports car and torched a semi. Can we call it even? No. Not even close. We've been, uh, questioning that South African guy. You know they got giraffes down there? He's giving us all sorts of intel On guys he's worked with -- Drug cases, murders... It's like Christmas in there. Dan, we lost a brick of pure heroin, all right? We can hardly call it a victory. I wouldn't say "lost." What are you talking about? Don't ever say "all clear" again! Cover me in the front. I got to call the lieutenant and call for backup. Yes, lieutenant! This is Detective Bailey. It is a long story, all right? Just -- det-- Detective Stark and I need cover. Send 'em code 3 -- as many squads as you can! Hey, old timer... Sorry about the shootout. How much for this, uh, doorstop? Oh, that's five dollars. It's a brick. That's hand-painted, there. I'll give you three. Done. Here you go. That's three. How much for one of them chocolate bars? Them candy bars is 50 cents. Why'd you do that? I was hungry. No, not the candy bar. What made you think of switching up the bricks? Well, you wanted to do it by the book, right? Yeah. Well, I had to "secure all evidence Against the possibility that it may be compromised." You've read the book. That's in there, right? That it is. So, let me just get this clear -- Paco took off with a hand-painted doorstop? I'm not gonna waste your time. I'm bringing you top product. This is the best heroin that money can buy. This is easily worth $400,000. That's wholesale. There. "remember the Alamo"? Well, listen. T-there's seems to be A l-- just kind of a little mixup here. No, no, no. No. Wait. Wait. Wait. Please. Please! I can explain! Got to hand it to you, Dan. You did it. Wayne Young busted in 48 hours, All for $3.50. Actually, $3.52. I think I lost a couple of pennies In that gunfight. And all I have to do Is convince Liz to reduce Julius Grant's sentence From five years in federal prison to six months probation. Like I said, bein' a cop's a team sport. Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com
