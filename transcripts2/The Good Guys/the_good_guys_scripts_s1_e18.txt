 Freeze! Police! All right. Stand back. Stand back. It's a steel door, Dan. Aah! Oh! Hurts! Hurts! Okay, stay back! Stay back. Come on, now. It's steel, Dan! It's foot-proof and bulletproof. Think you can shoot a cop and get away, do you? Aah! What are you doing?

I'm asking you to grease my chest. Do you want me to fit through that hole or not? Come on, now. Grease my back. Grease it. Grease it. Get it on there. Get it on. All right. Let's get it on there.

 What the hell? It's the strike force. Move! Move! Move! Let's go! What are they doing here? Uh, they must have heard the radio call. I don't care where they heard it. This is our crime scene. All right. Open her up! Clear! Fire in the hole. Okay. Bring him out, boys. Unbelievable. What the hell do you think you're doing? You got a problem? Yeah, I got a problem. You can't just breeze in here, take our case. Take your case? Last I checked, we were the department's rapid-response team. We got a report about a fleeing suspect and gunfire. Well, we had this. Oh, really? Yeah. That's not what it looks like to me. It looks like, uh, you were covering yourself with motor oil while we were getting the job done. Come on, Dan. Let's go. No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm gonna set this blow-dried son of a bitch straight. You listen up now, okay? You stay away from our cases or... or what? I'll show you what a real cop can do with a battering ram. I have three words for you, Detective... learn to control your partner. Look, lieutenant, there's no doubt that Dan was wrong to try and... Do whatever it was he was trying to do with that battering ram. Yeah, you think? But you and I both know, okay, the strike force are a bunch of smug, self-congratulating meat-heads. Really? This is the same strike force that you applied to join? That was months ago. They didn't even read the application. Wrong. I got a letter from them this morning. Not only did they read it, but you have an interview with them this week. This is a big opportunity, Jack, okay? This strike force is the top anti-crime team in Dallas. So when you go in and sit with these smug meat-heads... Don't blow it. Yeah. Okay. Thank you, lieutenant. she tear you a new one, partner? Yeah. Something like that. Don't worry about it. Supercops, my ass. We're a better team th they'll ever be. Am I right? Uh, yeah. Listen. Uh, Dan, uh, I-I got to tell you something. Hey, detectives! Oh. Are you busy? No. No. Uh, we're not busy. What's up? I figured you were probably upset about losing that case to the strike force, so I thought I'd cheer you up. Do you remember that stolen-truck case you got last week? I found it. You found the truck? I was going through the uni reports. It came in this morning. Everyone missed it except me... and now you. Where is it? Where's the truck? It's in a middle eastern restaurant on grand. In a middle eastern restaurant? What do you mean, "in"? Getting that feeling, Jackie... Way down low. This is big. Big? I doubt it. It's probably a bored kid, right? He steals a truck, gets drunk, crashes it, and then runs off. Yeah... runs off to commit another crime. I'm telling you. Jacko, this is crimey. I found the insurance document all the way at the bottom of my desk. Unbelievable, huh? Always the last place you're looking. Uh, just to confirm... there were no items stolen from the premises? What? You're joking, or... It's a middle eastern restaurant. What's there to steal... falafel? Depends. What exactly is falafel? Is it a drug? 'Cause if it is, you're under arrest... no, it's a food, Dan. It's fried chick-peas. It's safe to say no one was here to steal that. Uh, how did you hurt yourself? Did that happen when the truck, uh, hit the restaurant? No. This, uh... What happened... when the truck crashed, I was inside in the front doing paperwork. I come out. Everybody gone. And, uh, this... I just... cut myself making tabbouleh. What exactly is... also not a drug, Dan. It's a food, too? Yeah. Believe me, detectives... the truck, it's, uh, nothing. It's, uh, an accident, huh? You seriously want to drive into a wall on purpose? Yes, I do. I'm telling you... it's the best way. But it's a nice truck. Mm-hmm. You sure they got a safe in there? Yes, man. I heard from my cousin. He knows a guy who knows the guys who are running this place. Says they're players. What kind of players? "What kind of players"? What do they play? They're just players, man. It means they're big-time. With cash. So I went in there and I checked it out. I saw this dude go into this back room. Uh-huh. And right there in the wall was a safe. Probably all kinds of cash in it, man. But... The truck has leather seats. Hey, stealing cars in this economy is for suckers, okay? We need to start thinking bigger... much bigger. Come on, man. Let's do this. Okay. You ready? Yeah. Put your seat belt on, 'cause we're doing through a wall. Oh, good call. Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah. See? Easy. Safe. No problem. All right, let me get... oh, man. That's heavy. You get it. Okay. Watch your back. There you go. Come on. Get it in the trunk now. Come on, come on, come on. There you go. We did it, man! We did it! Hey! You! Stop! What the hell?! Go! Stop right there! Get in the car, man! Get in the car! Open the door! Go! Open the door! Aah! Ow! God! Oh, my God. They took everything. You took everything! So they didn't take anything? Oh, nothing. What... I don't buy it. Every time I drove a truck through the wall of a restaurant, I had a damn good reason. So I'm gonna ask you one more time, green eyes, what was in there? Dan... excuse me. Mr. Sharzer here is the victim, okay? He's not a suspect. So far. Uh, excuse me. No, no, no. Why don't you go to the car. Let me handle this, okay? I'm gonna go to the car. Okay. Good idea. Sorry about that. He's like that with everybody. No need to be concerned or... File a complaint or anything. But, uh, filing of your insurance, uh, claim, you're going to need a form... uh, 455. Falafel, my ass. Come on, now. That's right. Oh, geez. Jack's phone. Hello. Is this Jack Bailey? N-no. It's... it's Jack's phone. Could you not call? I'm trying to get my jam on here. Oh. Uh, can you just tell him that the interview for the strike force 00 P.M. tomorrow? Excuse me. Did you just say "his interview for the strike force"? Yes. He applied in may. Yes, I will pass along that message. What? You know, I knew the strike force stole cases. I didn't realize they stole partners, too. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? I'm talking about betrayal. I'm talking about one partner's loyalty to another. Okay, you found out about the interview. All right. Well, let me explain. Hey, there's no need to explain. I mean, you want to be on the strike force so bad... Ask them for a ride. Dan. Dan! To walk from deep ellum? No. I doot. Two hours. My feet are killing me. Well, maybe you should have thought of that before you betrayed me. I cannot trust you to ride in my tranny. You might soil it. Oh, you can't trust me? You're the one who answered a private phone call on my phone. It's called a favor. It's what people do for friends. Okay, look, Dan. I am sorry I didn't tell you about my strike force interview, okay? But this is not personal. They're the most prestigious unit in the Dallas police department. They have the most funding, the best resources. Every other case, they get cited by the mayor. And you know what they don't do? They don't cover each other up in motor oil. I am proud... of my willingness to lubricate myself for the cause of justice. You should be, too. We got a major case here. You're just bailing on it. A major case? Dan, a truck crashed into a restaurant, okay? That's a moving violation. No one was hurt. Nothing was stolen. Just because they said nothing was stolen doesn't mean nothing was stolen! Hey, grasshopper, here's an insight. Sometimes criminals lie. Okay. So then here's your theory. A truck crashed into a restaurant to steal... Something... something we have no way of identifying, something the owner says does not exist, but something that is nonetheless incredibly valuable. I couldn't have said it better myself. Well, I'll believe it when I see it. Do you see that? Diamonds, man! I thought you said it was just gonna be cash. We're rich! This is awesome! Oh, yeah, man. It's awesome, all right. Oh, we should call sweet Ricky. He'll know someone who can move these. No, no. You know what? Don't... don't do that. Wait. D-don't call nobody. What's wrong? I heard some stories is all. Stories? What kind of stories? Well, about a crew out of South Dallas that smuggles diamonds. These Israeli guys. The way I heard about it was that they, um... They had stabbed a guy in the head... Because he tried to rip them off. That can't be the same guys, though, right? I mean... Donzo, that restaurant was in South Dallas. That guy, he... he was speaking some kind of... Jewish, right? Man, this is bad. This right here is very bad. What kind of person stabs someone in the head? I don't know. You idiot! Asher, how is it my fault? They were in the safe. Look what they did. They broke the whole wall down. All the way from South America I have to bring them. I have to steal them. I have to hide them. And the guy from customs... remember what I had to do? Yeah, yeah. I... the stones were supposed to be in Tel Aviv on Friday. Do you know what Elan will do to both of us if they are not there? Do we have to tell Elan? How about I cut out your heart and send it to him instead? Good idea? Yes? I don't think it's such a good idea. I already talked to everyone... everyone who buys, everyone who sells... everyone. I will get the diamonds, I swear. What about the cops? No, no, no, no, no. Don't worry about the cops. They're not that bright. As a matter of fact, they were so busy fighting with one another to even care. I want to shoot him sometimes. - I really do. - Jack, listen to me. I know that you're still upset about your fight with Dan, okay? But you really need to focus on this strike force interview. Yeah, okay. Okay, uh, first, what are the major statutes that deal with the, uh, SWAT searches and... Jack? Are you paying attention? Yeah. Uh, yeah. I'm sorry. It's just... You know, I've never seen him like this before. You know, he's like he's a wounded puppy. And... He was really pissed at being wounded. Jack, you have nothing to feel guilty about. The strike force is... is the best job in Texas law enforcement. Exactly! And if I want to make Captain someday, I need a position within the department with some visibility. Strike force is perfect for that. Okay. So why don't you just try explaining that to him? I have... multiple times. He just... he doesn't get it. He thinks this is about me leaving him. Jack, come on. He is a grown man, okay? I'm sure he doesn't think that. He's leaving me, my brother. You should leave here, okay? Because it's late. Dan, please. You're right. Just one more. Okay, not to pry, but, uh, you and Detective Bailey... that... that's just, like, a professional thing, right? Because you know what? If it's... if it's more than that, you can tell me, okay? I'm not... there's no judgment here. Being partners is the closest relationship there is. Julius, he's interviewing for the strike force. Oh! No, that's cool, man. They busted my cousin once. They got this, uh, this big-ass, uh, s.U.V. Kind of thing, and it... it... What I mean is that's terrible. You got to help me. If I can prove to Jack that we're sitting on a major case, I know I can change his mind. You know what I want to do? I want to review how this snitch thing works. Now, a truck, uh, crashes into a restaurant. You don't know what was stolen. You don't know if anything was stolen. Now, what am I supposed to do, man? You're supposed to tell me if you hear about anybody selling something big, something small, something unusual, something... Regular. All right. I want to hear from you. You will hear from me. Who's my snitch? I'm your snitch. I will be at the office... Awaiting your call. Hi, Detective stark. I wanted to, um, show you something. Uh, are you okay? I'm just... I'm grieving. See this pad here? Jack used to leave notes for me back when he was my partner on this. Listen to this. "Dan, please stop eating my breakfast yogurt." Signed simply "j." He didn't have to write "jack." He knew I knew it was him. Well, you know what? Do you remember the stolen truck? I do. I checked it out, and I found a fingerprint. It was partial, but I checked the crime database and I found a correlation. A correlation? That's... that's one of those, like, pervert things, where you have, like, sex with someone in your own... no. No? No, no, no. No, no, no. It just means that I found your car thieves. You found them? Yeah, I checked the computer, and here's an address right here. Darling, thank... this is exactly what I need. You give that computer machine a biscuit for me. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get this to Jacko. All right. Interesting record you've got here, Bailey. Well, thank you very much, sir. I've always worked... interesting. Not good. Oh. I'm gonna be honest with you. With the hiring freeze, we can only recruit from within the department. And the only reason you're here is ruiz convinced me, against my better judgment, that you'd be worth my time. Well, that was very kind of her. I still haven't forgotten that incident with you and stark. And if you make the cut, you need to understand the strike force is the most elite law-enforcement team in Texas, and we do not, under any circumstances... Cover each other in oil. Ever. You got that? Absolutely. It was an isolated incident, and I'd appreciate an opportunity to prove to you I can use more traditional police tactics. That's good. 'Cause I've seen what happens with stark's partners, and I need to know that you haven't been, um... What's the word? Contaminated. Sir, I... hey, partner... Got a big break in the case. Let's roll. Uh, I'm kind of in the middle of something, Dan. I'm sure it can wait. Oh. Um, okay. I'm sorry. There's just some crime going on. If you want to work on your career, knock yourself out. Um, I... I'll tell you what, Bailey. You call my office. See if there's a time we can do this that, uh, fits your partner's schedule a little better. Yes, sir. Awfully sorry about this. Yeah, me too. Dan, seriously? This couldn't wait? No way. Crime is like a woman. When she needs your attention, you got to pull your gun out and... So you found a fingerprint. How is that so urgent? 'Cause it's a lead, Jack. Leads are something that cops follow up on. I know the strike force just comes in at the end and takes credit for it, but you're not on the strike force yet. Yeah, but we're just here to question some car thieves. Was it necessary to drive 50 Miles per hour down a residential street? If it's worth driving to, it's worth driving to fast. My point is, okay, this is no major crime. Yeah? Are those bullet holes? It's probably nothing, right? Should we just call it a day? What the hell happened here? Would you give it a rest? Stokes is gonna be here any second. Whole bunch of money, and the diamonds will be out of our lives. Are you sure we can trust Stokes? I can still call sweet Ricky. Sweet Ricky? The jerk that screwed us on those convertibles we boosted. T-that's who you want to do business with? Yeah, but then he gave us those cowboys tickets, remember? Let me ask you something. I want you to really think about it. You think football tickets is worth getting screwed out of $2,000? They were really good seats, Murph. He's not a bad guy. Okay. My cousin wouldn't set us up with Stokes unless he was solid, man. Okay? I'll call him right now, all right? See if he's on his way with the money. Yeah. Yeah. Okay? That makes you happy? Yeah. Good. Have a beer. Come on. Hey, it's Murph. Who's this? Hey, man. What's up? Yeah, listen. Uh, where's Stokes at? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. All right. Later. What? Hmm? Oh. Um, yeah. He... he wasn't there. 'Cause he's on the way with our money? N-not exactly. N-no. Some guy stopped by the house and... Stabbed him in the head. What?! Relax, man. Are you serious, man?! Keep it together, man. Getting all excited ain't gonna help us right now. You need to keep a calm head and just be focused, all right? Breathe. Breathe. There you go. That's good, man. Breathe through it. That's gonna be fine now. There you... it's girl scouts... probably. Murph, get the diamonds and run! Oh! Forget the door. They went out back. Get down to the road, man! Hey, now! D.P.D.! Anyone here? Looks like somebody left in a hurry, huh? Yeah, after a whole bunch of gunfire. All right. Do you just drink the suspect's old beer? Yeah. It's an old cop trick Frank taught me. I can tell by the bubbles how long it's been there. I'd say about three hours. That is disgusting. Nonsmoker. Hey, I got something here. What you got? It's a wall safe. Yes, it is. See this wallpaper? It's the exact same wallpaper in the falafel restaurant. Looks like we got ourselves a lead. The same wallpaper. That's crazy. I mean, how crazy is that? I don't know, Mr. Shasher. How crazy is it? Look, I-I bought this on sale. Probably everybody has it. As a matter of fact, we know quite a few people who have it, no? See? Everybody has it. The safe was blasted through a wall, and seeing as how you have a gigantic hole in yours... The safe? Oh, Detective, what... what would I put in a safe? What? Falafel? What? What the hell you staring at, zippy? You want a picture? What's his problem? Oh, it's... it's nothing. It's, uh... low blood sugar. Don't worry. I'll fix him something to eat. He'll feel better. Look, this is crazy. I told you... there's no crime. There's nothing to worry about and nothing to investigate. Just one more question. What's wrong with your leg? This? Oh. It's... it's nothing. I-I... actually, this is a very funny story. I slipped when I was, uh... Cooking, uh... Food. Funny. Very funny. So, uh, have a nice day, huh? So... You still think nothing's going on? It's suspicious, all right? I agree with you, Dan. It's suspicious. Suspicious? Place should have a big ol' neon sign over it that says "crimey." Look, all we have are a bunch of little pieces, okay? Nothing conclusive. I mean, basically, we don't know anything. They know everything! Asher, calm down. Oh, come on. Put that away. Killing cops only brings problems. We can lose everything. We could lose everything when they arrest us. For what? What are they gonna arrest us for? We should arrest his ass for being a liar and a weasel with emerald eyes! Yeah, take that to the d.A. Listen, Dan, we have no hard evidence, okay? I mean, maybe we can match the wallpaper and build a case from there. That'll take forever. Let's just cuff them, and we'll work it out later. What is the rush? All right, no one's in immediate danger. I'm going to kill them... now. Please, I am begging you. Give me more time, please. More time for what? For Elan to come from Tel Aviv to kill us both? This argument is a waste of time, all right? Let's just go. Yeah, got to get tarted up for your strike force interviews, huh? Dan, I am not betraying you. I just want to be where the action is. Asher, no. Okay. Did you hear that? Hear what, Dan? It's a falafel restaurant, all right? Can we go? Please. Please. Give me more time, please. Okay. We'll have it your way. But tomorrow you will find me those diamonds, or you will be the one with a knife in the head. Okay. I got Dan's report on this case of yours, which, by the way... since when does Dan do the reports? Since I started cheating on him with the strike force. Oh. Well, in that case, I have read all that I can decipher, but I would really like your take on it. Uh, it's a stolen truck, still. I mean, it might be connected to something bigger, but for now, it's just a truck and some suspicious circumstances. Well, Dan calls it "the case of the century." Said he thought it had something to do with a drug... "Fie-la-full"? "Fal-luff... " falafel... the food. Mm. It's one of those cases. Yeah. All right. Did Dan ever tell you about the time that he and Frank busted a human-trafficking ring? Actually, no. That's 'cause it never happened. Dan was absolutely convinced that a birthday clown named Mr. jelly was running a human-smuggling operation and convinced Frank to pull an unauthorized raid on a "slave farm." Oh, boy. Mm-hmm. Legally, I can't get into details, but I will say this... a slumber party was ruined, and Frank was passed over for sergeant, permanently. Do you see where I'm going with this? Yes, I believe I do. If you want to make strike force, you cannot let Dan stark distract you. Shaw's giving you another chance. You got to let him know that you're serious about this. I am. And thank you, lieutenant. N-no, no, no. No, that's great. We'll take whatever you got. Yeah. We'll be right there. Be right where? We got a lead in the case. Oh, you mean the crime of the century? I'm telling you, Jacko... I got that tingling feeling down in my loins. Feel it? The tingling? In your loins? Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't feel it. Well, you will. Come on. Let's roll! And drinks for the ladies. That's for you, and that is for you. You guys doing good? Is this for me? Mm. I like that. Thank you. How is it that you run the only bar in Texas that is filled with college girls at noon on a Wednesday? You know what that's called? Good service. Okay, what do you have for us? Oh, yes, you told me to call you if I heard about anything, so I jotted down a couple notes. All right, now, these are in no, uh, particular order. Got a guy in deep ellum that's trying to fence some frozen squid. Skeeter heard about a couple guys. They ripped off a bowling alley. Julius? Hmm? You call these leads? Look, don't blame me, okay? He told me to call if I heard about anything big or small or unusual or... or kind of regular. Said it had something to do with problems that y'all was having in y'all relationship. I-it's a relationship that he insists is entirely professional, and I, for one, believe him. W-where was I at? Oh, yes. There's a cheese shop in uptown. Dude's selling stuff out the back slightly past the expiration date. Okay. We are wasting our time. Please let him finish. This is important to me. Go ahead. Okay, I got a guy named Rico. He's selling a bunch of X-ray film he got off the back of a truck. I got another guy trying to move some hot diamonds. Got this one chick. She's selling alpacas and cocker spaniels... hang on. Go back. Go back. Diamonds? Diamonds. Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh, this guy's name is Dave. He's got a diamond shop in uptown, said he got it off a couple car thieves. He don't know how they got their hands on it. Car thieves? How's that for a lead? Well, the truck that was driven into the restaurant was stolen, yeah. T-that's promising. Hey, you got the address of this Dave dude? Uh-huh. I can be there on Tuesday. I already got a plane ticket. I know, man. It's the soonest I could get it for. Excuse me. Hang on. What can I help you with? Uh, you sell diamonds here, right? Yeah. You know, it's called Dave's diamond depot. The sign's on the door. Right. Let me ask you one more thing. I'm sorry. What kind of documentation do you have on your diamonds... about where they come from and whatnot? I-I want to make sure we're buying the good stuff. I don't have time for this, okay? You want to buy, look around. The stuff in the cases... Is for sale. All right. Yeah. Sorry. Uh, one of the village people wants to buy a ring for his boyfriend. Anyway, if we're gonna do this, I'm gonna need all cash up front. Unbelievable. Excuse me. Sir?! Ix-nay... ix-nay... on the adge-bay. Right. Okay? Don't tip him off. Come here. Uh, Jacko, for the record, uh, if I were a lover of men and you were my man-lover, I would never buy you a diamond in this store. Thanks, Dan. That's sweet. We could negotiate it here, but we're gonna negotiate it there. He's talking about a big cash sale, okay? These could be the diamonds we're looking for. I say we get a warrant and take him down. Dan, to do that, we have to explain something we don't know, all right? How did stolen diamonds end up in a strip-mall jewelry store? Very interesting, fellas. Mm-hmm. So, how much you think those bad boys are worth? I'd say these... Bad boys are worth, say, hmm, $2 million, maybe $2.5 million. That's great. That's great. I mean, that's what I was thinking that they were worth. So, you know, we're on the same page. What you think? We take $1 million? $1.5 million. One and a half. Oh, no, no. No. See, this is a negotiation. You made your offer, and now I make a counteroffer. I got you. See what he's doing? Trying to negotiate. Okay. So, um... What's your best offer? Four grand. He said "four grand." These rocks are hotter than hellfire. I'm guessing that if you had a better place to sell them, you wouldn't be behind a discount furniture store. Judging by the state of your automobile, I'd say you're motivated sellers. Four grand. No way, man. Forget it. Hey, let's go. No, no, no. We're taking the money. What?! Why?! Why? 'Cause I don't want to get stabbed in the head is why. Four grand sounds good. I'm telling you... that Dave guy's a punk. We'll figure out the warrant. You can work magic with the paperwork. I've seen that. What? No, no, no, no, no. I am not doing paperwork, Dan, all right? I got a strike force interview in an hour, and I got to get home and change. Oh, yeah. Lord, I forgot. You should... you should do that. I'll fly solo on this one. You... you work on your career. I'll work on crime. Just trying to make a point. Yeah, I know... the kind of point where you drive off and you leave me stranded. I'm not getting out of this car, Dan. We got to get out of here. Now let's get in your house and get your stuff. But my grandfather left me those baseball cards. Yeah, I know. But they're worth a ton, and the four g's ain't gonna get us very far, all right? Those Israeli guys catch us, we're dead. Grandfather wouldn't want you dead, would he? I don't know! He didn't really like me all that much! Man, I just keep thinking about that truck we stole. We could've got like five g's for that. I know, okay? But the truck is gone. It's gone. It's gonna be fine, okay? We're gonna get inside, get the cards, and then we'll go. Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You think you can steal from us? No. I mean, we did, but I'm so sorry! You're going to be more sorry. Hey. Hey. You have your strike force interview right now, right? Yeah, yeah. I'm just waiting for Shaw and sweating through my suit. You look great. I just came to wish you luck. Thanks. Are you okay? Yeah. I just... I feel bad bailing on Dan, you know? I mean, we're trying to get a warrant on this case we're working on, and... Jack, Jack, don't worry about that. This is important. It's your career. I know, and Dan keeps telling me I'm picking my career over, you know, justice. Well, that is ridiculous. I know you, Jack. You would never do that. Detective Bailey, we're ready for you now. Oh. Kick ass. Detective Bailey. Are you coming? Uh... Yeah. I-I'm sorry. I have to go. So now I put the name of the perp in the... in the flashing rectangle. Where it says "location to be searched"? No. No. That's not right. No. That's... that's "dave's... "Diamond... I just want to shoot this thing so bad right now! So you've never filled out a warrant request before? No, that's Jacko's thing. He wrangles the computer. We're running out of time. This place is gonna clo... look who's here. Dan, are you trying to work the computer? Yeah, that's correct. I'm interfacing with the computer machine. I thought you had your audition for the strike force. I did, but I'm here instead. I got a warrant for Dave's diamond depot... suspicion of trafficking stolen goods. You're welcome. That's what I'm talking about. I knew you'd come around. You never really wanted to be on the strike force. Incorrect. I did. I did very much. Why? So you can get your picture in the paper? Well, yeah, and a bigger paycheck a-and bigger cases... all of those things. You know, if this turns out to be nothing, I'm gonna kill you. Guess we'll see. Froberg, you in there? Mr. froberg! Are you okay? Thank God you guys got here. He was gonna kill me. Who was gonna kill you? Aah! Two men sold you some diamonds. Where are they? The men? I-I don't know. Aah! Aah! Not the men. The diamonds. O-over there in the bag behind the register. They are all here? I-I think so. T-that's all they gave me. I don't know. I-I... oh! Just put your head on the counter. Turn towards the wall. Aah! I don't want to turn towards the wall. Please! Turn towards the wall. Aah! Just look away. Aah! Froberg, you in there? It was horrible. You two. You... you came in earlier, right? The guy and his boyfriend. No, we're not a couple. We're members of the Dallas police department. Okay, who was this guy? What'd he look like? He was scary. He... he had an accent. Okay. Anything else? Tattoos, whatnot? He had a scar right around here. The silent guy at the middle eastern restaurant. He had a scar on his face. Okay, you gonna be okay here for a while, Dave? 'Cause me and my boyfriend here... we are gonna go get this dude with the big knife. Check. I want to make sure they are all there... Before I, uh, kill them. I think yes. I think they're all there. You think or you're sure? Because if they get to Tel Aviv and there are some missing... you know what? Now that I'm thinking about it, if you give me one second, let me check again. One, two, three. You want me to separate the big ones from the small ones? Mm. Okay. Five... Are you sure falafel's a food? 'Cause there's no one here eating it. Quiet. Let's make sure the place is clear. What? Free olives. Don't give me that face. What was that? Did you hear that? Where are they? Where are the men who tied you up? Hey! Get down! Okay, I got it! Cover me! Or not! Aah! Aah! Hold it. Hold it. Back up. Back up. Aah! Aah! Okay. We're safe. They can't get in. Yeah, Dan... And we can't get out. Like, a lot of times. And the one guy has this knife. It's a big knife, really huge. Puts it right here behind your ear. Yeah, we heard about the knife. Look, we stole the truck, okay? A lot of cars, too. Okay. Thank you. But we're not diamond thieves. I mean, we are, but we didn't mean to be. We don't want to die. Can you just take us to jail or whatever? Please. It is not that simple, all right? We need to call for backup, and I don't have my phone. I left it in Dan's car. It's charging. Dan, do you? My phone? Yeah. I don't carry it. Of course you don't. Which means we're gonna be stuck here a little longer. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's okay. It's all right. Just keep it together. Asher, enough already. We have to get in there and kill them. We don't need to kill them. We have the diamonds! You want to leave the cops alive? They know our faces. Do you know what Elan will do to us if we get caught? Plus, if we let them go, we're going to have to burn the place down. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Burn it down? Yes. Do you know how hard I had to work to make this place? A middle eastern restaurant in Dallas? Then please shut your mouth and get me an ax and some more ammunition. No, I'll shut my mouth. Oh. All right. All right. Okay, good. I should be able to get out through there. Oh, man. No, no, no. That's gonna be impossible. What do you mean? What do you mean? No, no. Look. He ain't gonna make it. It's gonna be impossible. You see the size of him? He's got that huge belly, man. It's not going through that hole. You're not gonna be able to make it, man. You're gonna have to stay here. Come on, guys. You can't leave me here, man. That... that guy's gonna stab me in the head. I-I don't want to die 'cause I'm fat. We're gonna get you out. Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here. What's that? Is that... yeah, it's grease, okay? Don't rub it in, but, you know... Rub it in... put it on. Okay, I don't want you to be scared, now. But I want you to take your shirt off. What? Hurry. Okay. I'll join you. I'm gonna get all greasy right with you. You know what, Asher? Maybe a little more on an angle, but put your hips into it, you know? I'm just trying to help. Where are they? Come on. Dan, you cuff them, all right? I'm gonna go to the car and call for backup. Kiss the wall! Kiss it! Kiss it! Kiss it, greasy boy! Okay, boys, let's go. Let's go. Go! Go! The strike force is here! Yeah, of course it is. Someone must have heard the gunshots and called it in. Hurry up. We have to... - Freeze! - Drop your weapons! Put your hands up! Guns on the floor! Freeze! Get on your knees! Drop your weapons now! Okay, okay, okay. Freeze! Okay. Nice work, everybody. You got to be kidding me! This is ridiculous, all right? This is our bust. This is 100% our bust. You know what? I'm gonna talk to them. Yeah? What are you gonna say? That those guys stole the diamonds, then these guys stole them, then another guy stole them. Then... Those guys stole them again? Is that what you're gonna tell them? Well, yeah! That's what happened! Yeah? Are you gonna explain that to the judge and the jury? How is that gonna fly? Okay. Here's what happened. The strike force busted two diamond thieves who stole some diamonds. We busted two truck thieves who stole a truck. And the owner of a jewelry store who very much deserved an ass-kicking got his ass kicked, all right? This coming from the guy who hates the strike force, who... who... who said he had a feeling in his loins that this case was gonna be a big crimey crime. Yeah, I get another feeling in my loin. You know what it is? Justice being served. It's kind of a... tickly feeling. You feel it? Yeah. All right, come on. Come on. And... I think we have a deal. One year in county, three years' probation. Why are you taking it so easy on them? Mainly because they offered to pay restitution for every single vehicle they ever stole. I don't know what you did, but I have never seen two suspects more willing to confess. Oh, it was nothing. It was just, you know... cop work. Hey, um, I heard about the strike force. Sorry. Yeah, well, uh, you miss two interviews, it sort of ruins your chances. Who'd they get for the position? Officer digger. They bought a new police dog. Oh. Well... I'm still proud of you. Bye. Bye. I'd just like to say the real credit for this bust doesn't belong to me. It, uh... It belongs... To my team, the whole strike force. They're the, uh, the real heroes who did the hard work to bring down these diamond thieves. I'm just the guy at the head of the team... With the biggest gun. Sir, the governor put out a news release congratulating the supercops, the Dallas p.D. Strike force. Any comment on that? We're just doing our duty. If that makes us supercops, then I guess, um... Well, I guess we're supercops. I'm sorry you didn't get to be a supercop. It's fine. Whatever. You know, the strike force is going down to Austin for a few weeks to get a bunch of awards for their work on this diamond thing. Oh, yeah? Yeah. So I'm thinking that anything we investigate now, they won't have time to get back to take the credit for. That's true. So what do you say, partner? Should we find ourselves a major case? Yeah. Let's do it. Hey, Shaw. You suck. sync by yyets.net
