 Welcome to Kallsk?r. We're embarking on a journey together. She says she's seen a body. I bet the others are dying to know what happened last year. You are to keep quiet, hear me? Stop it! We're afraid that you're starting to hallucinate again. - A participant went missing last year. - Maja? - I have to talk to Uno about this. - Yes, or don't. Look. They're about that missing girl. - Her name's Josefine, not Maja. - The coastguard found no body.

 Uno's name is Erik Larsen. He was a suspect in her disappearance. They were a couple. The Foreign Legion attracts the thuggish kind, wouldn't you say... ...Erik? Something on your mind, Johan? Why didn't you check the anchors?! Or was this deliberate? - He was fucking Josefine, you know. - Why didn't you tell us? Amina! - Where are you going? - Don't you get it? You mean nothing to me. Nothing! BLACK LAKE Episode 5 As I'm sure you all know, one of the course participants decided to leave us yesterday.

 Any thoughts on why? Anyone that knows something I don't? She said she had no reason to stay. Right. And? What? You were there. She couldn't handle the pressure. Too many bad things happen here. Last year, and now... May I ask how she left? I don't know, Johan. But I'd urge you all to be respectful of one another. Be understanding. Work together. Okay? Good. Pack your rucksacks. We're taking a little day trip. Meet me on the veranda in an hour. Minnie? We'll have our chat now. So if you've finished your breakfast, you can come with me. I know you have some questions that deserve an answer. What do you want to know? Tell me what happened last year. With Josefine. I fell in love. Then what? - She left. - You sure? Did she leave a note? - Tell you that she was leaving? - No. She never said anything. I was arrested. Handcuffs and all that. Spent 24 hours in custody, while they searched through all my stuff. They didn't find anything. How do they know she left voluntarily? Why so interested in what happened to Josefine? Because I want to know. Right. There's more. What? Three weeks after she went missing... ...her daughter disappeared too. No one saw or knew anything. Josefine was in the middle of a custody battle. And her greatest dream... ...was to take her daughter, and disappear. That's what the police think happened. Was Josefine's daughter called Maja? No, her name was Elsa. Why? Can we move on now? There's a lot going on here, and I want to help you. The same way you helped Josefine? Why did Uno bring up your ex? How come you two broke up? Well... Why do relationships end? Well, she worked with your dad... Then she gets the sack, so you break up with her. What's the deal with your dad? What? Don't you have a dad? No. He got the boot. He wasn't quite up to the job. Neither was Mum. I reckon... ...it was the best thing I ever did. You choose your own family. - Morning. - I saw Agnes. I heard about your plan for today, where you're going. You never told me. No, I didn't know you were interested. But you're welcome to join us. At a discount, of course. Where you're taking them... It's not a good place. Right. - How's Bella doing? - Listen... That's none of your business. But you're having those... talks? - Yes, we are. - What has she said? Like I said: It's private. We've talked a lot about facing our fears. This is a good place for doing just that. We must all find our own path. I began one of my journeys here, as a youth coach. One of the camp leaders wagered a bet, daring me to spend a whole night alone in that house over there. You know what? It was a scary... ...and interesting experience. And I want to share it with you. Come on. - What, we're sleeping in there? - Only if you're tired. Everyone in? Right. Let me tell you a little bit about this place. As you probably know from Gittan's ghost stories, Kallsk?r was a quarantine station. This house was built in the 19th century, by the city of Stockholm. It acted as a holding facility for cholera patients. Then after the last major epidemic in... ...1866... ...the building was abandoned until the Second World War, when it was used to house Baltic refugees. This place has always been about life and death. The people who lived here had no other choice. But you guys do. You're free to choose how you wish to spend your lives. Follow me. Today's exercise begins with exploring this place. When you've had a look round, find yourself a room. Lie down on the floor. Take it all in: The walls... ...ceiling, smell... ...and not least, history. Think of all those who've died here. And of all those who miraculously survived, and then reflect on your own life: "Who do I want to be?" "What do I want to achieve... ...before I die?" Okay? One rule: Respect one another. Don't ruin it for each other. Agnes and I are here if you need us. Meet me outside when you hear the bell. Then let's begin. KALLSK?R HOSPITAL CHOLERA EPIDEMIC 1866 What the hell's this? We need to talk. Huh? About what happened last summer. - And to Amina. - Amina? What do you... - What happened to Amina? - I don't know. - Look at me! Don't lie. - No... What did you do to her? Why are you scared? Why are you hiding here? Now tell me exactly what happened last summer. - I haven't touched Amina. - This is your last chance to come clean. If you're lying, I'll beat the shit out of you. - Do you hear? - Mm. But I haven't touched Amina. Do you hear me? Go away... You need to go now... What the hell... Things have happened here, that you should stay well clear of. Maja! - Johan? - Yes? Listen... You know that necklace? - The locket with Maja's name on it? - I told you, I don't have it. No... But... How old do you reckon it is? I have no idea. It might not be linked to Josefine. What if it's connected to this place? Maybe Maja was a Baltic refugee, or a cholera patient? Look, you heard the rules, Minnie. Go to your room. I need this cert. Give over, will you! Have they ever harmed us? DAZED HITLER REFUSED TO LEAVE BUNKER PIPPI LONGSTOCKING GOES ON BOARD Hello? Hello! What are you doing? Chop-chop! Get a move on, we're heading home. Gittan has dinner waiting for you. - You're not hungry, are you, Vincent? - No. Come on, let's go. On the walk home, I'd like you all to try and share your experiences. I'll talk to you all individually tomorrow, and then I'd like you to share everything. Isabell, we'll chat now. - Okay? - Yup. Let's go. - Johan? - Yeah? What do you know about Oscar? That he's not well. Something happened back there. With him? Yeah. It was as if I... ...came close to something, and then he turned up. - I've no clue what you're on about. - I felt like I... I was just about to connect all the dots when... I dunno. Okay. Well, I don't know either. - Was it about Maja? - Yes. - But Oscar interrupted me. - Right. Listen, you need to drop that stuff now. Okay? Drop it. Come on. Dammit, Johan... - Hey... - Want my advice? Focus on getting your certificate. Okay? That's why you're here. And then you'll get your daughter back. I don't understand what you're doing. Well? Maja? Maja? Who is Maja? Are you following me? No... I was just wondering what you know. About what? You're acting strange. I'm acting strange? If you've come here to make friends, you're going about it the wrong way.
