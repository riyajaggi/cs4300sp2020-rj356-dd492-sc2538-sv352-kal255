 You are all here because you want to make a change in your life. I'm here because I want custody of my daughter. You know I've read your medical records? I have been clean for over a year. No hallucinations? No. Last year, a participant went missing. Josefine. Three weeks later, her daughter disappeared too. Was Josefine's daughter called Maja? No, her name was Elsa. Why? Today's exercise begins with exploring this place.

 Think of all those who've died here, and then reflect on your own life. "Who do I want to be?" You know that locket? What if it's connected to this place? I mean... Maybe Maja was a Baltic refugee, or a cholera patient? - Amina! Where are you going? - Don't you get it? You mean nothing to me. The Mannheim family, 1944 BLACK LAKE Episode 6 Hi, Vincent. Sorry, but we still don't hand out morning fags. - Very funny... Has she been in touch? - Who? - Amina. - No. Why do you ask? She was really upset when she left. Don't you want to know if she's all right?

 Yes. I have called her several times but she doesn't want to talk to us. But surely you must have... I don't know! Routines? - Don't you feel responsible? - Yes, of course I do. I hear you. Let's do this... Next of kin, Kallsk?r 2015 Good morning, I'm just popping in with a bit of room service. I'm busy getting organised and preparing for the meeting with Uno. - Okay. - What? I actually take this seriously. Sure, but isn't there always time for breakfast? Thanks. I'd rather have it on my own, though. Don't worry, I'll just sit here. I won't breathe a word. - I promise. - Please. Don't be so clingy. - Clingy? - I didn't really mean that. - But I'd like some time to myself. - Okay, sure. - "Clingy" was a new one, though. - Yeah... Sorry. You don't believe in tipping? - Okay. And you're sure she's there? - I think so. Right. Have you got a phone number for this friend? Not here. I can get back to you. Okay. That'd be great. Thanks! - No problem. - Thanks. Bye. Right... Apparently, she'd been planning on going sailing with a friend. He said he'd call back with the friend's phone number. - Was that it? - Anything else? I have to work. Vincent? Come on. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. A camera was all that was missing from this docusoap. - This is for your sake, Vincent. - For my sake? So that you can see what you said later on. You get to keep all the footage. I'm keeping nothing. Sure. No sweat. I look hot on camera, so I'm not worried. So, how are you today, Oscar? Fine. Fine. Hearing that makes me very happy. Last time we chatted, you weren't that great. - No. - No. All right, I guess. The same as usual. It's tough being on this island, but... Yes. It is hard. It's all about fear, guilt, shame and grief. These are all feelings that define us, but they also limit us and hold us back. And to be able to grow, we need to dare to delve deeply into ourselves. And standing on the bottom of that gulf, that deep, black lake of our own soul, only then can we honestly say that we know ourselves. Gittan? I want to apologise. I never had a chance to earlier. I... The door was open, and I honestly thought you were at home, so I... I really didn't mean to just barge in. Anyway, I wanted to apologise. And I wanted to ask you something as well. Mannheim? Is that your family name? - That doesn't belong to you. - I know. I... Who's that girl? That's me. That's Grandad. Damn them all! What is it you are looking for? I don't know. The... There's something about this island. Am I right? You, if anyone, should know. You and I have known one another for just over a week now. During this time, I feel we've had a lot of good talks. Many good exercises... I'd like to talk about the yesterday's exercise in the cholera hospital. That was all about life and death. It was about you having control over your own life... and your own death. I'd love to know more about how you felt. I should have known. So this is when we get all emotional? - Exactly. - I should have known. - Is that something you're afraid of? - Afraid? I don't mind talking about my feelings. Great. Right, let's get all emotional. This island has belonged to us for over 300 years. My mother always used to say that something hung over this island. Some kind of darkness or unrest. You can call it whatever you want. What did she mean? If you're at a crossroads in your life, and have to choose between the dark and the light side of yourself... Faced with that choice on this island... ...you will always choose the dark side. Have you seen things? - Seen things? - You know what I mean. In room 5... I don't know what it is, though. When I was at the cholera hospital... I saw a child. A girl. I think this is all about her. You have to leave this island as soon as possible. - Hi. - Hi. - I need some help. - Okay? I need to get into Gittan's place. To nick her false arm? I think Maja died on this island. And I'm sure Gittan knows something. You want to break in and then you want... ...to involve me, too? Am I right? I don't want to break in as such. I just need someone to stand guard. In case she comes back. Please? Shit! I'd like to talk about the exercise we did yesterday. In the cholera hospital. How you felt about it and what thoughts came to mind. It felt good, really. And my thoughts were good. What did you think about? Josefine. Josefine? You thought about Josefine Malmberg? You got to know her here last year? Do you feel like talking about that? There's not an awful lot to say, really. She was a lovely person. She actually liked talking to me. Not many people do. What was the reason you started thinking about her at the cholera hospital? Was it something someone said? She is always on my mind. You came to summer camp as a child. Was that how Gittan found you? Yes. It can't have been easy for Gittan. She had no children of her own, but she got me sorted out all right. Both of us have a family history of drug abuse. You carry that with you for the rest of your life. This island is what saved me. Coming here in the summers. But... At the same time, it scares me. Missing refugees all leaders of the Latvian resistance - a coincidence? Missing Baltic refugees regarded as a threat by Soviet regime What the hell... Are you still here? Yes, I was just... The view was so lovely that I... I'm off now. We've talked a lot about your family. How you have chosen to leave them. To break with them completely. Yes, that was thanks to you. - Oh? Okay. - I remember you talking to those kids. About your childhood, and what you said about never letting ourselves be weighed down by our past, and... That we should let go of old patterns and... Well, create our own family. Yes. My family no longer exists. They might as well be dead. Sometimes I wish they were. And then, you and I met... Right... There's one thing... Last year, you said you were not at all satisfied with this course. - I didn't get any help. - Yes, that's what you said. And now I'm wondering: - Do you think it'll work this year? - Nope. No? There's nothing wrong with you or your method... I'm glad to hear that. I simply think I'm beyond help. That's quite a relief, and it makes me able to relax. I see. Okay. That's... You know, I really get that. Maybe that in itself is the key to how you could get better. Stop chasing after something that may not actually exist. Love that doesn't exist. Recognition... Instead, try just being here and now. Should I get myself a "Carpe Diem" tattoo as well? Maybe. If you feel that's a good thing. No, because I don't live in the present. I've given up, remember. I don't believe you've given up. You were here last year, and you're here again. Of course you believe there's help for you. But that's not why I'm here! So, why are you here? Why are you here? I'm here... ...to find out what happened. To Josefine. - She doesn't deserve to be forgotten. - But nothing "happened" to Josefine. - She simply left us! - She was murdered. How can you say that? Do you know that for a fact? Do you know any facts? I always thought it was my fault. Was it because I was too young? Was that why? There was too much... Too much crazy stuff was happening and it all went pear-shaped. But I thought we'd agreed to put that behind us? You hurt me so fucking much, you know. Hi. I thought you might be wanting a break from the gang. - Tough day today? - You could say that. Tell them I'm taking a dump. Hello. I'd been planning for us to talk about yesterday... ...but I feel we have more important things to discuss. - Would that be okay? - Sure. For me to be able to help you, you need to be totally honest with me. And with yourself, too. Is there anything you want to tell me? I'm asking because I've been talking to someone who's concerned about you. Who? Gittan. And she... She was telling me that this place has been bothering you. That you've seen things. Is that true? Say something! Have we got stuff to talk about or not? Child ghosts. Apparitions. A corpse in the water... Hallucinations. - I wasn't hallucinating. - Know what? You seem to be running around on this island chasing ghosts because you're afraid of facing your own problems. I... I know this is real to you. We've spoken about that. But do you realise that no one else here has experienced the same things as you? No one. I'm no fan of Freud's, but he did say we can use escapism and delusions to defend ourselves, and that's something I believe in. Minnie, I won't be able to help you with everything. But I can help with your escapist behaviour. I'm thinking about your daughter. Luna. Stop escaping! Are you real? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I'm here to find out what happened. To Josefine. - She disappeared. - She was murdered. How can you say that? - Do you know that for a fact? - Do you know any facts? - Are you okay? - I have to phone my daughter. - Has anything happened? - No. I simply need to phone her. - Minnie, I'm not allowed to... - You must let me phone my daughter. Please! Okay. Come on. - Minnie? What's wrong? - I don't know her phone number. Thanks. - Hello? - Hi darling, it's Mummy. Mummy! Do you know something? - I missed you so much today. - You did? I fell in kindergarten. I hurt my knee. It was even bleeding. - Oh, my poor darling. - Johanna gave me a plaster. - And what are you doing now? - Playing with Tuss. - Who's Tuss? - Tuss. - But who is that? Have I met Tuss? - Tuss is Theresia. - Mummy, can I also have a pet name? - Of course you can. - You know Mummy will be home soon? - Okay. - I'm pressing the red button. - Love you! Josefine Malmberg Daughter Elsa's dad, Magnus Lundborg Hi there, Erik. Take a seat. I was thinking we'd have a chat about yesterday's exercise in the cholera hospital. I'd like to talk about something else. Okay. About what? - Hello? - Hello! I'm phoning regarding your daughter Elsa and her mother Josefine. - Is this the police? - No, my name's Minnie. I work for a newspaper. I'm a journalist. We're doing a piece on custody disputes. I don't want to talk about that. It's private. - So, you haven't heard from them? - No. No, I haven't. - Nothing? Not a single word? - No, and it makes me livid. The police seem to be doing fuck-all. Write that: I'm totally powerless. - What's that? - I'm glad you're asking. This... is actually a bit of pretty advanced accounting. Gittan's own records. And in here, it says... ...that Gittan sold the retreat to one Erik Larsen. It seemed like a pretty decent deal for both parties. However, I suspect it wouldn't go down well with the taxpayer. Do you agree? Quite a lot of public money was invested here. I imagine people would like to know where that money ended up. - What do you want? - What do I want? Surely you know that by now? I'd love to go to a meeting in Sandhamn. Along with my computer, mobile phone and certificate. Please. I'd just like to know... Did Josefine have any enemies? The only one she ever called her enemy was me. I understand. Thanks. Thank you so much. - Sorry if I bothered you. - Okay. Hey! One more thing? Elsa... Did she have a pet name? No. Well... not a pet name as such, but... Josefine was the only one who ever used it. Maja. After Maja in "Pelle No-Tail".
