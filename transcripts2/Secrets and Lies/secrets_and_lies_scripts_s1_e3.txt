 OKAY, OKAY. LISTEN, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, I WAS TERRIFIED OF THE BOOGEYMAN, AND IT GOT REALLY BAD. AND I SAID, "I'M GONNA TAKE JUSTICE INTO MY OWN HANDS." SO I GO OUTSIDE OF MY WINDOW WITH A BASEBALL BAT, IN THE BUSHES, AND I FIGURE I'M GONNA CATCH THE BOOGEYMAN IN THE ACT. NO. MY POPS WAKES UP, HE SEES SOMEBODY OUTSIDE, HE ALMOST BLOWS MY HEAD OFF WITH A 12-GAUGE. YOU GET IT? STUPIDITY IS GENETIC? NO. IF YOU FEAR THE BOOGEYMAN, YOU BECOME THE BOOGEYMAN. YOU DIG IT? IT'S DEEP, RIGHT? YEAH. I HAVE A FAMILY. YOU DON'T. YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR? I NEED A .45 FOR HOME DEFENSE. GOT A NICE USED GLOCK 21. I'M JUST SAYING THAT MAYBE WE'D ALL FEEL A LOT SAFER IF YOU LEFT THE WHOLE SCOTTY-SEARCH THING TO THE COPS. AS LONG AS SCOTT IS FREE, MY FAMILY ISN'T SAFE. CORNELL'S SO CONVINCED THAT I KILLED TOM, SHE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING FOR HIM. WELL, HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIND HIM? SCOTT KNEW THE DNA RESULTS BEFORE THEY LEAKED. JESS WOULD NEVER TELL HIM, SO SHE HAD TO TELL SOMEBODY. AND WHOEVER IT IS, THEY KNOW WHERE SCOTT IS. Man: CRAWFORD. CAN I HELP YOU? HOPE YOU'RE BUYING THAT GUN TO KILL YOURSELF.

THE NEIGHBORS PUT UP LIGHTS. YEAH, BUT THEY PUT THEM UP BEFORE TOM DIED AND BEFORE ALL THOSE REPORTERS WERE CAMPED OUT. IF WE HANG THEM NOW, PEOPLE MIGHT THINK WE'RE NOT SAD ABOUT TOM. BUT YOU ALWAYS SAY I SHOULDN'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK. WELL, THIS IS DIFFERENT. 'CAUSE THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD'S GRIEVING. I'M SAD. I'M SURE YOU ARE, TOO. BUT I KIND OF DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL.

I'LL -I'LL DEAL WITH MY DAUGHTER. WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU PUSH HIM? HE CALLED YOU A "BABY KILLER." THAT'S NOT OKAY. CRAIG, YOU APOLOGIZE TO ABBY RIGHT NOW. BUT YOU SAID IT --  NOW. I'M SORRY. ABBY. DAD... I'M SORRY. YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE HEARD IT. GO. [ SIGHS ] LET'S GO. [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] [ PANTING ] [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] I KNOW EXACTLY... WHAT'S GOING ON? UM, DETECTIVE CORNELL WANTS A RECEIPT FROM THE FLASHLIGHT I BOUGHT YOU, BUT THE FILES ARE IN THE CABINET AND IT'S LOCKED. ISN'T SCOTT MURPHY IN CUSTODY? I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SHARE THE DETAILS OF THE CASE WITH YOU. BEN, SHE SAID THE RECEIPT COULD HELP ELIMINATE YOU AS A SUSPECT. IF THE MODEL OF YOUR FLASHLIGHT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE FORENSICS INDICATES WAS THE MURDER WEAPON, THEN YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK. DON'T YOU NEED A SEARCH WARRANT? ONLY IF YOU'RE UNWILLING TO COOPERATE. THE PROBLEM IS, IF I COME BACK HERE WITH A WARRANT AND CSIs AND DETECTIVES, THE PRESS IS JUST GONNA FILM THE WHOLE THING. AND NO MATTER HOW I TRY TO PROTECT YOU, THEY'RE NOT GONNA LISTEN. THOSE HYENAS WILL JUST KEEP ROLLING AND LET THE PICTURE TELL THE STORY. WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING ALL THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. BEN, DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE KEY IS? YEAH. IT'S RIGHT HERE. [ SIGHS ] HERE WE GO. YOU OKAY, MR. CRAWFORD? YOU'RE SWEATING. YEAH, I JUST CAME BACK FROM A RUN. IT'S NICE YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH YOUR ROUTINE. MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T. Christy: I KNOW IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME. I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU IF IT'S EASIER. THANK YOU. Christy: NO, I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE. EVERY TIME I TURN MY BACK, YOU'RE HELPING THAT WOMAN TRY TO PUT ME AWAY. HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? SHE THINKS I KILLED TOM! YOU UNDERSTAND?! BUT YOU DIDN'T. YOU'RE INNOCENT. THE MORE WE COOPERATE, THE SOONER SHE'S GONNA SEE THAT. [ SIGHS ] THAT'S SO NAIVE. THERE ARE COUNTLESS STORIES OF INNOCENT MEN BEING EXONERATED DECADES AFTER BEING IN PRISON, SOMETIMES AFTER THEY WERE EXECUTED! SHE IS A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. SHE'S LOOKING AT EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE TO SOLVE TOM'S MURDER. HE WAS YOUR SON. I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD FEEL SOME RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP HER. THAT WASN'T FAIR. WHAT IS? [ SIGHS ] CHRISTY, I'VE SCREWED UP... A LOT. BUT I NEED YOU TO STAND BY ME ON THIS, AND IF YOU WON'T DO IT FOR ME, THEN CAN YOU PLEASE DO IT FOR OUR GIRLS? YES, OF COURSE. I AM. AND I WILL. I'M LATE.

I USED TO BE ON STAFF AT ONE OF THOSE BIG, ESTABLISHED FIRMS, BUT THAT WENT AWAY, SO... NOW JOB TO JOB. I KNOW HOW THAT IS. YEAH. AND, MAN, IT MUST BE TOUGH GETTING WORK WITH YOUR FACE ALL OVER THE NEWS. YEAH, I'M, UH, I'M REAL GRATEFUL YOU WEREN'T SCARED OFF, SO... BELIEVE ME, I GET IT. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE GETTING DIVORCED, MY EX -- SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT I SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER. MM. YEAH. ONE OF THOSE NIGHTMARE CUSTODY FIGHTS YOU HEAR ABOUT. I'M SORRY. YEAH. I FOUND OUT RIGHT THEN HOW FAST PEOPLE RUSH TO JUDGMENT. IT'S LIKE I WOKE UP ONE DAY AND SUDDENLY, I WAS THE BAD GUY. YOU KNOW? IT'S PRETTY SURREAL. YEAH. BAD AS IT IS FOR ME, I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS FOR YOU TO FIND THAT LITTLE BOY OUT THERE. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL FOR YOU. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] OH, I'M SORRY. I-I WASN'T THINKING. HEY, LET ME HELP YOU DOWN. I'M ALL RIGHT, MAN. Y-YOU HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT A S-STORY IN THE NEWS, AND YOU FORGET THAT REAL PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED. I JUST HAVE TO GO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER. RIGHT. OF COURSE. A-AND I'M SORRY... AGAIN. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] I BOUGHT THIS FOR YOU. IT'S JUST LIKE THE ONE I HAD WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE. BACK WHEN I GOT MY FIRST BIKE... YOU WOULDN'T TAKE IT OUT OF THE GARAGE WITHOUT ONE OF THESE. [ BELL RINGS ] I WAS SAVING IT TO GIVE TO YOU FOR CHRISTMAS TO GO WITH THE BIG-BOY BIKE YOUR MOM WAS GONNA GET YOU. IT WAS JUST SITTING THERE IN MY TRUCK. FORGOT I EVEN HAD IT. MERRY CHRISTMAS, LITTLE MAN. Scott: I HEAR YOU SAY THAT, AND I ASK MYSELF, "IS THAT GRIEF? OR GUILT?" THEY LET YOU OUT? I HAD AN ALIBI. [ RADIO CHATTER ] WELL, THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU COME FORWARD? MY ALIBI WAS NICOLE, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT JESS. OR YOU DIDN'T WANT THE MPs TO FIND YOU. [ SCOFFS ] SO BRAVE WHEN THEY'RE WATCHING. PEOPLE LIKE YOU, BUDDY, HAVE NO IDEA. IN WORLD WAR II, GUYS SAW 40 DAYS IN COMBAT THE WHOLE WAR. IN IRAQ, I DID 310 MY FIRST TOUR ALONE. I'VE DONE FOUR ROTATIONS. THE BRASS WAS PLANNING A FIFTH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE, SO I WENT AWOL. I COULDN'T GO TO MY OWN SON'S FUNERAL. I DIDN'T KILL TOM. I HOPE NOT. [ SIGHS ] FOR YOUR SAKE, I HOPE NOT. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I KNOW HE WAS YOUR SON. I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] WHAT IS IT? [ SIGHS ] BEN, WHAT'S WRONG? BEN, WHAT IS IT? SCOTT DIDN'T DO IT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE DIDN'T KILL TOM. YES. OF COURSE HE DID. THERE'S NO WAY. HE HAD TO. CORNELL LET HIM GO. WHY? WHY WOULD SHE LET HIM GO? HE HAD AN ALIBI! THEN WHO DID THIS? WHO WOULD DO THIS... I DON'T KNOW. ...TO MY LITTLE BOY? I HAVE TO KNOW! I NEED TO KNOW! I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. CAN'T JUST LIVE NOT KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SON! WHAT IF THEY NEVER FIND OUT? I WILL FIND OUT. I'LL FIND OUT, AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY. DO YOU PROMISE ME? YES. YES. I PROMISE. [ SHOWER RUNNING ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] I'M HOME. [ SHOWER STOPS ] CAN YOU HAND ME MY CLOTHES? THANKS. [ DOOR OPENS ] THOSE EARRINGS ARE REALLY GREAT. THANKS. SO, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TONIGHT? A BUSINESS DINNER. [ SIGHS ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [ SCOFFS ] IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ASK ME?

WHY DO YOU HAVE THE TEST? I'VE NEVER CHEATED ON YOU. THEN WHY WAS IT IN THE BAG? LOOK, I KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. AND I'M SORRY, BUT I AM NOT PREPARED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

SCREW THE MONEY. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN I GET HOME. [ HUMMING ] WHAT, AM I TOO LOUD? WHAT IS IT? WHAT HAPPENED? [ SIGHS ] MY FLASHLIGHT CAME BACK. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHAT? IT -IT FELL OUT OF THE TRUCK WHEN I OPENED IT. OKAY. [ SIGHS ] YOU DIDN'T MISS IT THE FIRST TIME YOU LOOKED? SOMEBODY PUT IT THERE. OKAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS SCOTT. UH-HUH. HE GOT INTO THE HOUSE SO EASY, WHY NOT THE TRUCK, RIGHT? THAT MAKES SENSE. YEAH, IT DID, UNTIL I FOUND OUT THAT SCOTT DIDN'T KILL TOM. WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME? SO HE NEVER HAD THE FLASHLIGHT. DO YOU EVEN KNOW IF THE FLASHLIGHT IS THE MURDER WEAPON? IT IS. UH-HUH. OKAY. YOU DIDN'T TOUCH IT, DID YOU? I'M NOT STUPID. I WIPED IT OFF. EINSTEIN, THAT'S CALLED TAMPERING, OKAY? IT'S A FELONY. [ SIGHS ] YEAH. THE LEAST OF MY WORRIES. OH, MAN. THAT IS REALLY STRANGE THAT THEY BROUGHT IT BACK TO YOUR TRUCK, THOUGH. REALLY? YOU THINK? I'M JUST SAYING THAT THEY COULD HAVE BROUGHT IT TO THE COPS, YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD DO. WHAT? GOT TO GET RID OF IT. HOW? SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SET ME UP.
