 Secrets and Lies (2015â€“2016): Season 1, Episode 6 - The Confession - full transcript 
 After the vandal is out of the way, Ben dismisses police warnings that he needs protection against the pro stalker, but dares not refuse it for his family. Ben makes up by free repairs with Dave, the only one still willing to help with his latest theory, again turning on veteran Scott. Actually Ben is abducted and tortured, even water-boarded, by hostile 'State Department-retired neighbor' Kevin Williams, who demands a 'confession' that he killed his own illegitimate son to cover up his 'disgusting' adultery, but surprising help arrives last moment. While the paparazzi move on to another case, Gutter reporter Arthur Fenton discloses to Ben he's really after a presumed bad cop of interest to both.

 VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF COVERING THEIR TRACKS THIS WELL. WE ALSO WEREN'T ABLE TO TRACE THE REAL SOURCE OF THE TEXT I RECEIVED FROM YOUR NUMBER. WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THIS? PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS THAT YOU MURDERED A CHILD. YEAH, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED THEM TO THINK. DEAD CHILDREN TEND TO ELICIT A HEIGHTENED EMOTIONAL RESPONSE. WHOEVER DID THIS, THEY WATCHED, THEY WAITED. YOU HAVE A STALKER, MR. CRAWFORD. YOU MEAN ASIDE FROM YOU? YOU'LL NEED POLICE PROTECTION. I CAN ASSIGN A DETAIL TO YOU IMMEDIATELY. NO. E-EXCUSE ME? YOU WANT PERMISSION TO FOLLOW ME AROUND SO YOU CAN SEND ME TO PRISON FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO. THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. Christy: HEY. EXCUSE ME. YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. I-I GOT LOCKED IN THE TRUCK. BEN, SOMEONE'S AFTER YOU. CORNELL'S LOOKING INTO IT. YEAH, LIKE SHE'S LOOKING INTO TOM'S MURDER. GO AHEAD. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. Woman: SHE'LL LEAVE WHEN HE GETS LOCKED UP. I JUST FEEL FOR THOSE POOR KIDS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? DON'T. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. THIS IS JU-- MY LIFE NOW. [ SIGHS ] YOUR LIFE SUCKS. LET'S GO HOME. DAVE: Are you guys okay? [ LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS ] WE'RE FINE. [ Sighing ] Oh, man. IT'S LIKE THE GUY'S LEX LUTHOR. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN EVIL GENIUS OVER HERE, MAN. SO WE KNOW IT'S NOT YOU, THEN. [ SIGHS ] SERIOUSLY, MAN, I'M SCARED. MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME OVER HERE AND STAY WITH ME. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU GONNA DO TO PROTECT ME? I GOT A BAT. Couple of nunchakus. ALL RIGHT. I'M HANGING UP. [ BEEP ] DAVE IS CONCERNED. I AGREE WITH HIM. THAT'S SCARY. WHO DO YOU THINK'S DOING THIS? UH, THEY SENT AN UNTRACEABLE TEXT TO MY PHONE. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN DO THAT EXCEPT FOR GOVERNMENT TYPES. [ SIGHS ] IF I SAY IT OUT LOUD, YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME I'M CRAZY. [ SCOFFS LIGHTLY ] YOU PASSED CRAZY ABOUT 10 MILES BACK. GO FOR IT. ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE KNOW KEVIN SERVED. RIGHT? AND THEN HE WORKED FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT. BUT JUST THINK ABOUT THIS. WHEN WE MOVED IN, KEVIN AND ELAINE BROUGHT US PIE. HE LENT ME HIS DRILL AND HIS MOWER, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE DAY, IT STOPS. WHY? [ BOOK THUDS ] I KNOW I'M RIGHT. I JUST HAVE TO PROVE IT. OH, WHY NOT? YOU WENT AFTER SCOTT, THE RICHARDSONS, MATT DALY. WHAT'S ONE MORE? SO, WHAT SHOULD I DO, WAIT FOR KEVIN TO MAKE HIS NEXT MOVE? [ SIGHS ] YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S KEVIN. JUST BEFORE YOU RUIN ANY MORE DINNER PARTIES, PLEASE GO OVER THERE AND TALK TO HIM. I'M NOT DENYING THAT HE HATES YOU. JUST ASK HIM WHY. OKAY. REALLY? [ CHUCKLES LIGHTLY ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ CELLPHONE RINGING, VIBRATING ] [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] [ CHATTER ] SEE YOU AT THE PERP WALK, BEN. YEAH, THANKS FOR THE HOSPITALITY. WHAT'S GOING ON? NEW STORY. TEENAGE GIRL KIDNAPPED BY HER FATHER IN WILMINGTON. JUST LIKE THAT, THEY'RE GONE. JUST LIKE THAT. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] DID YOU NEED SOMETHING, BEN? KEVIN AROUND? UH, NO. YOU KNOW WHEN HE'LL BE BACK? NO. SOMETHING WRONG, ELAINE? I ALWAYS TRY TO SEE THE BEST IN EVERYONE, AND YOU ALWAYS APPEAR TO BE A GOOD MAN, BUT -- BUT THIS -- THIS HAS TO STOP, BEN. YOU NEED TO STOP. STOP WHAT EXACTLY? MY SON WAS KILLED. OH, SO NOW HE'S YOUR SON. SEEMS TO ME THAT SCOTT WAS TOM'S FATHER. OF COURSE HE WAS. I KNOW THAT. DO YOU? BECAUSE LATELY, YOU'VE BEEN ACTING LIKE THE FATHER OF A MURDERED CHILD. YOU DIDN'T RAISE HIM, AND YOU SURE AS HELL DIDN'T LOVE HIM LIKE SCOTT DID. IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK? IS THAT WHAT KEVIN'S PROBLEM WITH ME IS? KEVIN HAS HIS OWN ISSUES WITH YOU. I'M JUST TELLING YOU LIKE I SEE IT. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS. YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK THAT I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK, BEN, EITHER WAY. I'M FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE, ELAINE. AND YOU'RE DESTROYING EVERYONE ELSE'S IN THE PROCESS, STIRRING UP THINGS THAT NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE. WHEN IS IT ENOUGH, BEN? I'M NOT DESTROYING PEOPLE. THEIR SECRETS ARE. THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. YOUR PROBLEM IS YOU ONLY THINK ABOUT YOURSELF. I KNOW IT'S YOU. AND I KNOW IT WAS YOU. [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] Cornell: MR. CRAWFORD. I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT A DETAIL. I'LL RESPECT THAT. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS WILL ESCALATE. AND WHILE YOUR FAMILY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE TARGET, THEY COULD BECOME COLLATERAL DAMAGE ANYTIME THEY'RE WITH YOU. SURELY YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE SOME PROTECTION. WELL, IT CAN'T HURT, CAN IT? FINE. YOU WIN. [ DOOR OPENS ] NEW DEVELOPMENTS  IN THE KIDNAPPING OF SARAH THOMPSON  HAVE EMERGED -- [ TV SHUTS OFF ] I WASN'T WATCHING THAT. WHY ARE THE COPS OUTSIDE? I ASKED FOR A DETAIL. A DETAIL? WHAT? LIKE, TO PROTECT US? YEAH, KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS. WHY NOW? IT'S GONNA BE FINE. YOU KNOW I'M NOT ABBY, RIGHT? OKAY, HON. MY TRUCK WAS TAMPERED WITH. AND AFTER THE FLASHLIGHTS IN THE GARAGE, WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS. WHAT COULD HAPPEN? NOTHING. I ASKED FOR THEM. THEY'RE JUST BEING CAREFUL. [ BOTTLES CLINK ] YOU DO REALIZE YOU DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, RIGHT? I'M VISITING. [ BOTTLE CAP CLINKS ] BY THE WAY, YOUR SECURITY SUCKS. Natalie: DAD, WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON? HONEY -- WORRY NOT, YOUNG ONE. THE PSYCHO VIGILANTE IS AFTER YOUR POPS, NOT YOU. NO ONE ASKED YOU, AND NO ONE'S AFTER ME. NO, THANK YOU, DAVE. IT'S NICE TO BE TREATED LIKE AN ADULT. SORRY. [ TV CHATTER ] I'LL KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT FROM NOW ON. CAN YOU? [ SIGHS ] HAVEN'T SEEN HER BROOMSTICK. [ BOTTLES CLINK ] WHERE IS SHE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED? Christy: WORKING IN MY OFFICE. HEY, CHRISTY.

SO YOU JUST FIGURED IT OUT? YES. ARE THERE OTHERS? THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO KNOW IS TO SEARCH YOUR WHOLE HOUSE. THE DETAIL'S ASSIGNED TO MY WIFE AND KIDS. YEAH. AND YOU'LL KEEP THEM SAFE? I WILL. THEN SEARCH AWAY. I WON'T BE HERE. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] WHERE ARE YOU GOING? DAVE'S. WHAT? YEAH, THEY'LL SEARCH THE HOUSE AND FIND ANY OTHER CAMERAS OR ANYTHING THIS GUY'S USING TO STALK ME. SO, WHY CAN'T YOU STAY? YOU GUYS WILL HAVE THE DETAIL. YOU'LL BE SAFE. BUT HE'S AFTER YOU. I'M NOT GONNA LET COPS FOLLOW ME AROUND. WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE DOING? WHY ARE THEY HERE AGAIN? [ SIGHS ] SORRY. I TRIED TO KEEP HER UPSTAIRS. I'M NOT A BABY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

YOU KNOW, I, UH, WAS THINKING, IF SHE'S GOING THROUGH ALL YOUR STUFF, AREN'T YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE ashlight-flay? UH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

TOM WAS AT MY HOUSE ALL THE TIME. WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE? SHOULD I JUST HAVE IGNORED HIM? AND WHY NOT? YOU WERE JUST ACROSS THE STREET WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS OFF PROTECTING HIS COUNTRY, PROTECTING YOU. I DON'T BLAME HER. ELAINE WAS ALONE, SCARED, VULNERABLE.

WE TRACKED KEVIN'S CELLPHONE SIGNAL AND NARROWED DOWN THE LOCATION. YOU KNEW IT WAS KEVIN THE WHOLE TIME. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] WHAT ONE KNOWS AND WHAT ONE CAN PROVE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS. HOW'S THAT? I OFFERED YOU PROTECTION. YOU REFUSED IT. I TOLD YOU THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS SITUATION, AND YOU WENT OFF THE RESERVATION. BUT YOU KNEW WHO WAS AFTER ME. I CAN'T ARREST A CRIMINAL BEFORE THEY ACT, BUT I DID GIVE HIM A WARNING, WHICH YOU WITNESSED. AND SO NOW WHAT? KEVIN GETS OFF EASY 'CAUSE...I HAD IT COMING? I DID MY JOB. THE MAN'S IN CUSTODY. NOW IT'S THE D.A.'s PROBLEM, AND I CAN GO BACK TO SOLVING TOM'S MURDER. THEY'RE GONNA BE TAKING YOU TO THE HOSPITAL, AND A DETECTIVE WILL COME BY AND GET YOUR FORMAL STATEMENT.
