 Everyone behind the barricade. What can we do for you, son? Sir, you need to move back. Eric... Eric, I'm so sorry. Eric? - What happened? - Who could have done this? Did she jump? Sir, I need you to please step aside. We'll be right here, son. We're not going anywhere. Step back. Step back. Who let the grieving husband contaminate my crime scene? Looky-loos got their phones out. If you're afraid to do your job, I suggest you find another. Please tell me the roof has been secured.

 Yes, ma'am. Did you see anything? Mr. Warner? Mr. Warner? I'm Detective Andrea Cornell. I know this is impossibly difficult, but can you please let go of the victim? She's my wife. But she's also my victim. I'm so sorry for your loss. But I need to find out what happened to her. We can go in the lobby and talk. Amanda... I know you two were close. - Don't! - I'm sorry. I-I-I... - Hey, baby... - I was trying to help. I... Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Are you gonna be all right? I know this is incredibly difficult, but I'm gonna need to ask you some questions while the information is still fresh in your minds. How could... how could this happen? That's what I'm gonna find out. I understand there was a party upstairs at your firm? Wow. Hey! Here's the man of the hour. Congratulations, Eric. Thank you, Phil. Congratulations, Eric... truly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Aww. Hi. - Hey, sweetheart. Mwah! Dad, I can't thank you enough. For what? I'm not just giving you the firm. - You earned it. - Mm. Will you please explain that he is not the boss of me? I'm afraid not. You've been keeping me out of trouble, and now it's his turn. Good luck. - So, where's your husband? - In the O.R. Because he's brilliant and talented and in demand. Congratulations, buddy. - Thank you. - Yep. Kate. - Hey. - Hey. My god, you look gorgeous! Aww. Marriage agrees with me. - Mm. - Ah! Actually, I'm glad that you brought that up, because I introduced you to my brother, and I still haven't received a gift or cash. - Check's in the mail. - Ah. - Can I see the cards, please? - No. Mnh-mnh. Son, your speech is not for a few hours yet. I think that perhaps, just for tonight, you should try and be more like your brother. Patrick knows how to have a good time. Hey! Why are you retiring? It was the right time for Eric to take over. Was anyone unhappy about that? No. We were all very excited. Had Kate been drinking tonight... perhaps a little bit more than usual? No. She wasn't drinking. What about her state of mind? Did you notice any recent changes in behavior? Are you asking if Kate jumped? - What? - No. It was an accident, right? It's unlikely. Kate fell from the roof. I need to know if I'm investigating a murder or if this was a suicide. My wife didn't kill herself. How can you be so sure? 'Cause she was pregnant. I just found out today. It's our first. You ready? Something you want to tell me? I already know. How? You found it. You're not that stealth. This is what you were gonna tell me, right, that... that I'm the man? I mean... Look what I did. - You can say it. - You're the man. I want more conviction. You can... You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. It's... it's the hormones, baby. I'm just... I'm emotional. We hadn't told anyone yet. Oh, my god. Patrick. Detective... I know you are just doing your job... and... Your reputation precedes you... but I am an attorney with the... I know who you are, counselor. You work for the Public Defender's office. I'm sure the questions can wait. And when you do interview my brother, I will need to be there... as his counsel. Of course. Again, I'm so sorry for your loss. Why did you stop her? Eric, that cop is not on your side. Cornell thinks Kate was murdered. M-Mandy, that's not what she said. I don't care what she said, okay? Listen to me... please. Okay? They are investigating this as a homicide. When a wife is murdered, 9 times out of 10, the husband did it. Kate is dead. You're the husband. You are the prime suspect. Bro... Anything you need. I'm so sorry, Eric. Son, I can't begin to imagine your pain. We all love you. I don't want to do this now, but the police aren't gonna give us time to grieve, so we all need to be prepared. Detective Cornell won't rest until someone is behind bars. That's a good thing, isn't it? Not if Eric is the one she wants to put there. Are you sure that's what she wants? I do this for a living. They don't even know what happened yet. I mean do you know what happened? Does... does anyone? The cops have to treat this like a murder until they can prove otherwise, which is why Eric will be their prime focus. But everyone at the party is a person of interest, especially anyone she can put on the roof around the time Kate died. But, Eric, please do not speak to her without counsel. Everything that you say can be twisted and used against you, and it will. A little soon for defcon 5, Mandy. Fine... Dad can get someone else, a whole team of lawyers, and they'll say the same thing, and maybe you'll believe them. No, no, no. We understand. Are we done? I'm going home. Er... Hey. Eric. This isn't a good idea. Really. You can't go back to the loft, and you shouldn't be alone. Melanie's right. Why don't we stay at Dad's? - Dad? - Hmm. Why don't you and Eric stay at the house? Yes. No. I have to get my stuff. I'll... I'll get it for you. All right. Then it's settled. No glove, no love, Detective. Counselor. An officer will need to follow your brother home to take custody of his clothes for processing. We'll be at my father's. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. We'll have to do forensic tests in the morning, so I suggest you and your family stay away from the office. You okay? No. Why are you sweating? It's hot as hell in here. No, it's not. - Are you ill? - No. Couldn't sleep, either, huh? I have something. It doesn't work for me, but... everyone swears by it. It's just... Woman issues. I just can't believe she's gone. Just a few hours ago, everything was f... What happened? - I wish I could tell you. - Oh, baby. I'm so sorry, son. Kate was special. I'm sorry that we had to celebrate a day early. I actually forgot Thanksgiving was on a Thursday. Give him a break. Give him a break. I like this better... my mother gets apoplectic if we're not there on the actual holiday. Or for any reason at all. What? I'm gonna tell her you said that. You should. Hey, can I have some more, babe? God, yams are so wrong. No, they just don't pair well with vodka. Oh, that's not water? You know, what's the point in being rich if you don't have help during the holidays? - Are you serious? - I'm sorry. - You are not new here. - Yeah. I'm serious. You have been with Patrick for three years. I thought it was five. Thank you, Kate. It is five. Are you sure? It feels a lot longer. Melanie, I have always tried to teach my children to work hard... Give back, and take nothing for granted. And, obviously, to be a bunch of smartasses. All right. I wish that your mother could be with us to celebrate our blessings. Also, I would like to welcome Kate. I've been here plenty of times. Eh, cloistered in a room with Amanda, studying for the bar, but today you're here as Eric's guest. - Definitely a step up. - I, for one, am optimistic. Do you know he's never brought anybody home before? That's because you're all insane. Ohh. You two will be married within a year. No. We just started dating. When it's right, it's right. Where are you going? Work. Eric, I can take care of things. And Neil and Patrick will help out. You should really stay home. Yeah, we can stay here together. And do what? I can't just sit here and think about her all day. I just need to get to the office. All right, fine. We are going with you. - Red light. Hold the drop. - Eric, Eric... I thought I made it clear to stay away from the crime scene. - Eric, come on. Go home. - Please... just leave me alone. - We just want to help. - How are you gonna help me? Son, listen to me. I understand how you feel. - When your mother had... - It's not the same thing. Just... Stop trying to handle me. I'll be conducting interviews with the employees in the conference room, if that's all right with you. I don't know how many showed up. We gave them the option... Only nine people are out. Your employees must be very loyal. We think of them as part of the family. The interviews should only take a few days. And since Kate was chief compliance officer, - it'd be very helpful... - No. You can't have her emails. Kate had access to all company communications, most of which is proprietary. Do you want to interview me first? I am available, as well. That won't be necessary. My brother won't be questioned without counsel. I have no questions for Mr. Warner at this time. Guys! I can't believe you did this. We know you didn't want any frills, but... A bride needs her day to be special. Welcome to the family... officially. It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Now Eric just has to promise to love and worship me forever. - Mm-hmm. Wait. What? - Mm-hmm. Oh, too late, man. Nah, nah, nah. I will. I will. I will. - I do. - I called this! - Cheers. - Lovey, come on. Ahh. Well, should we get this show on the road? Um, I think we need a minister. Oh, you're looking at one, babe. I got certified online. Mm-hmm. - Wow. - Wait. This cannot be legal. - It is. - It's legit? - It's legit. - It is? Let's have a wedding. Let's go. Okay, family, family, let's gather 'round. - Let's get married, huh? - Lord god, lord god. I don't know what I was thinking. Okay, okay. Give... give me that. - Oh. - So sorry. Thank you, baby. I love her, man. She's the best. Take a seat, folks. - Thank you. Thank you. - Okay. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to... Hey. Come on! Come... hey, stop. Wait. Just... I got two words out. - Yes! - Is that it? Is it over? I guess so. You are not a good minister, honey. - Oh! - Get control of your ceremony. I'm gonna say a little prayer for both of you, because, you know... - Whoa! Whoa! - Aah! You need a hug? Yeah. Didn't think so. Uh... Wow. Even I'm not sure how to do this. Um... Yeah, so... Look, I'm not gonna ask how you are - 'cause that's just annoying. - Appreciate it. I know that you loved Kate, and now she's gone, so your life is pretty much over, and this totally blows. So if you want to go get hammered or punch someone, I can go get Patrick. What's she asking everyone? She got me on the way in. She's just trying to find out where we all were at the party and when. She needs to establish a timeline. Mandy says the cop thinks I did it. It's always the husband. Except this time. "Forensic files." It's... You watch too much TV. Okay, unlike my marriages, TV doesn't empty my bank account. Mm. If any of my three exes were murdered, I'd be an obvious suspect, but you didn't kill Kate, okay? You, my friend, are no killer. So there's nothing for her to find. But she tried. She asked about who you are. I just told her the truth. Which is...? Well, while I'm not worthy you're probably my best friend. You're a stand-up guy. Always have been. Yeah. Uh... Look, I'm gonna go pretend to work. You need me to reach out to any investors or...? Hey, Neil. Thank you. Gonna be fine if... Um... Uh, thank you. The fact that so many people showed up today... it's a testament to their love for your family. Or maybe their love of drama. I need the new financial projections. No. Uh, you... you do realize you work for me? Uh... I do have a few things that require your approval. I drafted a service announcement, picked a casket. I know tulips were Kate's favorite. There's no right time. Mnh-mnh. No work on Sunday. This... this isn't work. Well, it looks like work. Uh, no. I'm just trying to take care of a couple of documents before we get married. Oh. You want me to sign a prenup. Why is that funny? It makes sense to protect your family. Plus, Melanie had to sign one, so... You're no Melanie. She's not so bad. I think she just... She feels left out. Why are you so nice? Really, it's no biggie. You and me... we're solid. And if you leave me, I'm coming with you, so... Not in this case. In every case. Anyway... I'm going first. As painful as it is, putting off the inevitable will not bring her back. Uh... Mm. Uh, Kate didn't want wallowing. And she preferred cremation. I know we have to do something at the house, so let's make it as soon as possible and get it over with, okay? Detective! I don't know what everyone is telling you, but I loved my wife. Were you on the roof? I didn't kill Kate. That's not what I asked. I'll find out anyway... with or without you. You don't think she... - It's not possible that she... - No, that... that wasn't Kate. You weren't exactly a fan. Not true. Look, you're my buddy, and, for obvious reasons, I don't trust women. She was compliance. That's like internal affairs. Nobody likes them. Nobody with something to hide. Again, not true. You know how you're driving along, sober, observing the speed limit, and suddenly you got a cop in your rearview, and now you... you know how you tense up... your hands at 10:00 and 2:00, and your breathing stops... You are aware that I'm black, right? My point is, it's normal to be uncomfortable in the face of judgment by authority, especially with women. It's remarkable that none of your marriages worked. Kate didn't commit suicide. Someone killed her. I just don't know how this happened. The party was all family, employees, investors... all people we know and their dates. Who... Who would have pushed my wife off the roof? Morning. Hello. Look, when I hired you, you were just my sister's friend from law school. I never thought... - you think I did? What do you think they'll say? You're the boss, and I'm "that woman." Nobody would ever say that. No, no, not to my face. I have had to fight for everything, and in one fell swoop, that all goes away because you want to take this public. Okay, what do you want to do? You want to sneak around for the next 30 years? Okay, fine. There's only one thing to do. I'll go get another job. Oh, that's ridiculous. It's your father's firm. I'm not giving you up. And I'm not keeping this hidden anymore. Listen, um... I'm just gonna save you two some time. F.Y.I. We all know. So you're not fooling anyone, except... maybe yourselves. Just get over it. Okay? Whoops. _ Somebody was in here. Doesn't look like anything was taken. Should we tell the cops about this? Well, they'll dust it for prints and get back many sets... Kate's, her assistant's... Yours. - Is that yours? - Kate's. Kate has a white iPad. I was with her when she bought it. Guess she had two. Did you know she had a P.O. Box? What? She got a text message about a package. I didn't even know that she had a post office box. I didn't, either. Listen, uh, Eric... The autopsy's done. I'm gonna go to the morgue with dad for the results. I'll meet you downstairs. Eric, this is gonna be really h... Okay. Whenever you're ready. I heard you spoke to Cornell earlier. Is anything private? - Not if it happens in the lobby. - And not anymore. What did you say to her? Why are you here? For the autopsy results. I didn't tell anybody to notify you that it was completed. I have friends, detective. Kate Warner, 36-year-old female, died from a 12-story fall. The impact severed her spine in the cervical and thoracic regions. There were perimortem bruises on the brachia, indicating a struggle. Based up on that and the final position of the body, this is a homicide. Tests indicate the victim didn't have anything to drink or any drugs in her system, but we're awaiting the final toxicology. The victim was approximately eight weeks pregnant. As far as skeletal abnormalities that preceded death, there were signs of a healed fifth metatarsal fracture and evidence of separation of the pelvic girdle. There was? - What does that mean? - That means... Kate had a baby. No. She was going to have a baby. - It was our baby. - Yes, your wife was pregnant. But her body shows that she already gave birth to a full-term infant. Mr. Warner... You didn't know your wife had another man's baby? - Eric, about the results... - I don't want to talk about it. I know you're worried about me, but don't. It's my job. Can I stay with you? I just don't want you to be alone. You should go home to your husband. Come on. I know you love me and you want to help, but I need to do this alone. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. All right. What? It's very comfortable. And... and very pink. If we get a bigger place, you can have an office and put it in there. We don't need a bigger place. We do if that chair and I have to live together. You didn't know your wife had another man's baby? I'm the man? Look what I did. Eric. Hey. I'm so sorry. Kate was the best. Made me feel welcome from my first day. Thank you, Allison. This is awful. Yes, Bob. Really... Awful. I can't tell you how many times Karen stopped the car... it's "Kate." Kate stopped the car and just asked how I was. No one does that anymore. She was very fond of you, Marjorie. She's probably playing backgammon with my Irv in heaven. I'm sure she is. How are Kate's parents holding up? Losing a child, they must be devastated. Um, they died before we met. Really? Any siblings? _ Would you excuse me a moment, please? This is unbearable. Who got you? Marjorie? She called Kate "Karen." Ohh. Yeah. And Bob. - Oh, no! - Mnh. Bob, the most boring man ever. Janice, Valerie, and Eugene. Who's the woman in the purple scarf? I have no clue, but she hugged me. You think she crashed? She knew Kate's name. You want me to get her to leave? That'd be rude. Melanie will do it. It shouldn't be too much longer. You can just stay in here and hide with us until it's over. These things are always the same. Well, I'm me, so... I'll address the elephant in the room. Anybody been to see mom? Hmm. Yeah, right after I peel off my own skin. What would be the point, Patrick? It's not like she's dead. Hey. Look, I know this is... Well, it is what it is, but we have a houseful of guests who came here to see all of us. All of us? All of us. Where the hell have you been hiding? - Need anything? - No. Yeah, I know. Just kind of feels right to keep asking. - What's up with that? - She's probably mad he was M.I.A. I'm sorry. I wish I could stay, but I'm on call. Yeah. Thanks for coming, man. - All right. - See you. Detective, what do you think you're doing? I'm trying to do my job. You think this is the proper time and place for you to be doing your murder investigation? Well, there were over 100 people at the party, most of whom are here now, so the sooner I can get their accounts, the sooner... You should leave. My son is in mourning. I'm not questioning him. - Excuse me. - Yeah. Why? Because he's the prime suspect? Actually, until you're all cleared, everyone's a suspect. Amanda said you would do this. - Do what, exactly? - Eric, don't. - What do you want? - Please... stop talking to her. You're my lawyer, right? Let's get this over with. You want to know if I was on that roof? Oh, I already know. The office windows don't open, and Kate's body was too close to the building for you to look out and see it. So the only way you could know that your wife was on the ground is if you were on the roof. And if you talked to me, instead of talking to everyone else about me, you would know I have an explanation. Oh, I'm sure you do. Eric, she was ignoring you to make you do this. I did not kill my wife. What about Steven Porter? See, I know you were at Gatling juvenile detention center for six months. I have friends, too. You claim you didn't murder your wife. What about Steven Porter? I didn't mean to kill him. Synced and corrected by johnyd13 ~ www.addic7ed.com ~
