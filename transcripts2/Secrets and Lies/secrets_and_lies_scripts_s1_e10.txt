WHAT? SHE'S AT YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW'S. SHE'S WITH HER MOTHER. SHE WENT FOR A WALK AND DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] SHE'S SAFE AND SOUND. [ SIGHS ] I WANT TO TALK TO HER. AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE HERE, YOU CAN. OKAY, I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE SAID. I DIDN'T RAPE JESS MURPHY. SO YOU'VE SAID. I SLEPT WITH HER, BUT I WENT TO BED WITH ONE WOMAN AND WOKE UP WITH ANOTHER ONE. SHE IS CRAZY. I'M AWARE OF JESS MURPHY'S MEDICAL HISTORY. DID YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAD ANOTHER CHILD WHO DIED? AND THEN THERE'S TOM? WHERE'D YOU FIND THAT? I FOUND THAT SOAKING IN JESS MURPHY'S LAUNDRY SINK. COME ON. THIS IS INSANE. I DIDN'T RAPE JESS, I DIDN'T PUT THAT IN HER SINK, AND I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT JACKET SINCE THE DAY IN THE WOODS. I KNOW, MR. CRAWFORD. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I KNOW ALL ABOUT JESS MURPHY. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE JACKET. AND I KNOW YOU DIDN'T KILL TOM. YOU KNOW? I DO. YOU'RE FREE TO GO. GO HOME, MR. CRAWFORD. OKAY. [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] ABBY: I'm sorry, Dad. I wanted to be by myself. I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE OKAY. YOU AND MOM HATE EACH OTHER, AND -- I DON'T HATE YOUR FATHER. I DON'T HATE YOUR MOTHER. And Nat acts like nothing happened. I GOT SAD. BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU. Mom's really mad, though. YEAH, SO AM I. WE HAVE TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE, ABBY. YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE AND NOT TELL ANYONE. I know. DO YOU FORGIVE ME? IF YOU PROMISE TO NEVER DO IT AGAIN. I PROMISE. ABBY. MOM WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. IT'S ME. YOU OKAY? I THINK THE NIGHTMARE'S FINALLY OVER. What do you mean? What happened? THE BLUE JACKET WAS JESS'. JESS KILLED TOM? IT LOOKS LIKE IT. I can't believe this. COPS ARE BRINGING HER IN. I GOT TO GO. [ TWEEDY'S "THE WOLF IS ON THE HILL" PLAYS ] ? THE WOLF IS ON THE HILL ? ? THE BIRD IS IN THE BRIAR ? DID YOU DRUG THIS? OH, COME ON. I LEARNED MY LESSON... LIGHTWEIGHT. ? THE THORN IS ON THE ROSE ? YEAH. THAT'S MY BOY. [ LAUGHS ] ? AND YOUR TIME IS ON THE WIRE ? AHH. SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO FOR DINNER? I CAN'T STAY. I GOT A DATE. ? THOSE DAYS OF GRAVE CONCERN ? WHAT TIME DOES SHE LOG ON? SHE'S ACTUALLY A REAL PERSON. SHE'S 5'2"... BRAINS, BEAUTY, GOT IT ALL. SHE'S A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER. SHE LOVES KIDS. SHE LOVES HORROR MOVIES. SHE LOVES ALL THIS. AS WELL SHE SHOULD. AND SHE SAYS I MAKE HER LAUGH FOR SOME REASON, WHICH IS WEIRD. I CAN SEE THAT. I MET HER AT A GAS STATION. SHE, UH, NEEDED SOME AIR IN HER TIRES. AND YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT? NO. I GOT SOME OTHER DUDE TO HANDLE IT, AND THEN I MADE MY MOVE. SLICK. MM. I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME I HAD A DATE FOR NEW YEAR'S. ? THE ROAD HAS TURNED TO SAND ? YEAH. ? THAT YOUR WILL HAS SUNKEN INTO ? I'M SORRY. NO, DON'T. COME ON. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN ROCK IN THE HOLIDAYS WITH YOUR KIDS, RIGHT? BECAUSE CHRISTY HAS TO LOOSEN UP FOR A FREE MAN. RIGHT? [ SIGHS ] FREE MAN. TO FREEDOM. TO FREEDOM! HELLS TO THE YES, BROTHER. FREEDOM!! [ LAUGHS ] Jess: HE BROKE INTO THE HOUSE, AND HE ASSAULTED ME. DID MR. CRAWFORD HIT YOU? NO! HE GRABBED ME. HE -HE PUT HIS HANDS ON ME AND HE SHOOK ME. DID YOU SEE ABBY CRAWFORD TODAY? NO. I NEVER HAD ABBY. NO MATTER WHAT BEN SAYS, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. I'M NOT BLAMING YOU, MRS. MURPHY. IF YOU'D LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. CRAWFORD, I'LL TAKE YOUR STATEMENT AND THEN WE'LL GO DOWN TO THE HOSPITAL, WHERE THEY'LL EXAMINE YOU AND WILL DOCUMENT YOUR INJURIES AND GET A RAPE KIT. OKAY? NOW HAVE A SEAT. [ SIGHS ] CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED? WE WENT TO GO SEE THE FIREWORKS. BEN DROVE ME HOME. HE WAS LONELY. AND HE INVITED HIMSELF INTO MY HOUSE. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED? AND THEN HE RAPED ME. HE RAN AWAY IN THE MORNING, BUT HE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE AND ACCUSED ME OF KILLING MY OWN SON. SO, HE RAPED YOU, AND THEN HE SPENT THE ENTIRE NIGHT SLEEPING NEXT TO YOU? YOU REALIZE THAT BY FALSIFYING A POLICE REPORT, YOU MAKE IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR ANY WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN RAPED TO COME FORWARD. SO, IF YOU WANT TO PURSUE THIS AND I FIND OUT THAT YOU'VE LIED, I'LL NOT ONLY CHARGE YOU, BUT I'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU SERVE EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THAT SENTENCE. IS THAT CLEAR? [ SIGHS ] [ CHUCKLES ] WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME? I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. BUT YOU'VE BEEN LOCKED DOWN ONCE BEFORE ON A 72-HOUR HOLD. I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED LIKE YOUR MOTHER. I'M NOT LIKE HER! THAT'S MY JACKET. IS THAT BLOOD? YOUR SON'S KILLER WAS WEARING YOUR JACKET. [ SNIFFLES, WHIMPERS ] I DIDN'T KILL TOM. I DIDN'T KILL TOM. I DIDN'T KILL MY SON. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T, MRS. MURPHY. SOMEONE IS TRYING TO FRAME YOU. DAD? DAD! HE'S OUT HERE. HEY. [ CHUCKLES ] HEY. I MISSED YOU. ME TOO. THAT'S NICE TO HEAR. BUT DON'T TELL ANYONE I SAID THAT. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S ALL THIS? THE GIRLS BEGGED. YOU GUYS NEVER GOT THE CHRISTMAS YOU WANTED. I HOPE NEW YEAR'S IS OKAY. DEFINITELY. COME ON. THANK YOU. Cornell: THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING IN. THIS SHOULD ONLY TAKE A MINUTE. HAVE ANY OF YOU SEEN HER? HMM. I DID. YESTERDAY. DROPPED HER OFF NEAR CHELSEA BAY DRIVE. WHAT TIME? LIKE, 4:00 OR 5:00. IT WAS NEAR THE END OF MY SHIFT. WAS SHE WITH ANYBODY? NOT THAT I SAW. I'M GONNA NEED TO REVIEW YOUR SECURITY FOOTAGE. THANK YOU. HEY, COME HERE. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS ANY HARDER FOR THE GIRLS THAN IT ALREADY IS, BUT... IT'S SIGNED. [ SIGHS ] HARD TO BELIEVE 17 YEARS OF MARRIAGE IS GONE IN THE STROKE OF A PEN. IT'S NOT GONE. WE DID TWO THINGS RIGHT. THANKS FOR BRINGING THEM OVER. MM. I CAN'T BELIEVE JESS KILLED TOM. [ SCOFFS ] I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. ME EITHER. WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD. I DON'T WANT ANY MORE SECRETS IN THIS FAMILY. THEY'RE POISON. I JUST DON'T GET IT. I MEAN, WHY WOULD SHE DO IT? SHE HAD MORE PROBLEMS THAN WE KNEW. MORE THAN YOU KNEW. TOO SOON? WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT JESS? DAD, DO YOU REALLY THINK SHE DID IT? I DON'T WANT TO, BUT, YEAH, I DO. CAN WE EAT? [ Chuckling ] YES, WE CAN EAT. GIVE ME TWO MINUTES, OKAY? I GOT TO CLEAN UP SOME STUFF. N-WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO? I THINK I WAS PRETTY CLEAR. KEN, WE NEED TO CHARGE HER. WE CAN'T. YOU CAME TO ME WITH A LOT MORE EVIDENCE ON BEN CRAWFORD. I DIDN'T CHARGE HIM. YOU DON'T HAVE IT. SHE KILLED TOM MURPHY. IF YOU CAN'T PROVE IT TO ME, I CAN'T PROVE IT TO A JURY. YOU'RE LAZY. HANG ON A SECOND. I GOT 23 CASES ON MY DESK. I JUST LOST TWO IN A ROW. NOW, UNLESS YOU CAN GIVE ME A SLAM DUNK, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE THIS TO TRIAL. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? A MURDER WEAPON, A CONFESSION. BOTH WOULD BE GREAT. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] Christy: DO YOU WANT SOME RICE? OH, YES, PLEASE. WHAT ABOUT YOU, ABBY? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME? Abby: NO, THANKS. SMELLS REALLY GOOD. NO, I THINK I'M GOOD. ABBY, IS THIS BLOOD ON YOUR SNEAKERS? IS THIS BLOOD? I'M SO SORRY, DADDY. DID YOU FIND TOM? [ Nervously ] NO. TELL ME THE TRUTH. I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE. YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR WHAT? ABBY, WERE YOU WITH TOM BEFORE...? YES. [ SIGHS ] Christy: NO. NO. PLEASE, NO. [ BREATHES SHALLOWLY ] ABBY, DID YOU HURT TOM? [ Crying ] I DIDN'T MEAN TO! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! WHAT DID YOU DO? [ SNIFFLES ] WE WERE RUNNING AWAY. SCOTT AND JESS WERE FIGHTING, AND SO WERE YOU. IT MADE US SO SAD. I THOUGHT I HAD A WAY TO FIX IT. [ KEYS JINGLE ] Tom, get up. Tom, Tom. Get up. Hi. Hi. IS IT TIME TO WAKE UP? No. It's still night. But we're running away, so we have to go now. WHY? WHEN YOUR MOMMY FINDS OUT YOU'RE GONE, YOUR DADDY WILL COME BACK. REALLY? THEY ALWAYS COME BACK WHEN WE'RE IN TROUBLE. YAY! Shh! SORRY. OH, CAN I BRING MY TANK? Okay. Just be really quiet. Shh. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] Tom: ABBY, I'M SCARED. IT'S OKAY, SILLY. I'M HERE. I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU. THERE'S A SPECIAL SPOT NEAR THE RIVER. WE'LL HIDE THERE UNTIL YOUR DADDY FINDS US. MY TANK! WHAT? I LOST MY TANK! WE'LL FIND IT. IT'S GOT TO BE HERE SOMEWHERE. I NEED IT. IT'S GONE! DON'T WORRY. WE'LL GET ANOTHER ONE. I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ONE. I WANT MINE. WE HAVE TO HURRY. NO, I'M COLD AND I WANT TO GO HOME. NO, TOM, IF YOU GO HOME NOW, YOUR DADDY WILL NEVER COME BACK. NO! I'M TELLING ON YOU! I'M GOING HOME NOW! TOM, WAIT! STOP! I WANT MY MOMMY! I WANT MY MOMMY! [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPS ] [ Crying ] I'M SORRY. COME ON. WE HAVE TO GO. PLEASE GET UP. COME ON, TOM. PLEASE GET UP. [ BREATHING SHALLOWLY ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS, PANTING ] HELP! SOMEBODY HELP! [ In distance ] HELP! I RAN HOME TO GET YOU, DAD. BUT YOU WENT RUNNING EARLY. AND BEFORE I COULD WAKE MOM UP, YOU CAME HOME AND YOU WERE YELLING. I WAS SO SCARED. I DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE, SO I PUT MY SHOES UNDER THE GUEST HOUSE. I'M SO SORRY. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? NAT, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! I SWEAR I DIDN'T MEAN TO! WHY, ABBY? WHY?! WHY DID YOU THINK THAT IF SCOTT CAME BACK IT WOULD FIX ANYTHING? BECAUSE SHE HEARD US FIGHTING. Ben: WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO? Christy: GO TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S. SCOTT'S GONE. YOU CAN JUST MOVE RIGHT IN. I DON'T -I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH JESS. IF YOU DON'T GET OUT  RIGHT NOW, I WILL PACK UP THE GIRLS AND LEAVE TONIGHT! Abby: [ Crying ] IF SCOTT CAME BACK, HE'D BE WITH JESS AND YOU'D STAY WITH MOMMY. I JUST WANTED TO KEEP OUR FAMILY TOGETHER. [ CRIES ] MOMMY? WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA DO? I DON'T KNOW. WE NEED TO CALL THE POLICE. NO! NO, SHE MADE A MISTAKE. WE CAN'T LET HER GO TO JAIL. SHE'S A BABY. WHO KILLED ONE. SHE'S YOUR SISTER. AND SHE KILLED MY BROTHER. [ GASPS ] ABBY DIDN'T PUSH HIM OR LIE TO HIM OR STEAL HIS STUFF. SHE KILLED HIM. I DIDN'T MEAN TO! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT! OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO, TELL THE POLICE THAT. WE CAN'T KEEP THIS A SECRET. IT'S POISON. RIGHT, DAD? DON'T GO ANYWHERE. DON'T TALK TO ANYONE. JUST WAIT FOR ME. WAIT FOR ME. WHAT -- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? FIX IT. DAD! DAD, STOP! PLEASE! DAD, PLEASE. SAY SOMETHING. WHY THE DETECTIVEHAT FLASHLIGHT WAS LOOKING FOR IT,UCK? AND SHE WOULDN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE. I KNEW IF I PUT IT BACK, SHE'D STOP. AND THE JACKET -- HOW'D IT GET BACK TO JESS? WHEN I RAN OUT OF THE WOODS, I REALIZED THERE WAS BLOOD ON IT. SO, I HID IT BEHIND MATT'S HOUSE. I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WOULD FIND IT. BUT THEN... YOU FOLLOWED ME WHEN I WENT AFTER MATT AND TOOK THE JACKET. I MEAN, I'M THE ONE WHO TOOK IT, SO I KNEW I HAD TO GIVE IT BACK. IT WAS DIRTY, SO I PUT IT IN THE SINK. I'M SORRY, DADDY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT TOM. THEN YOU TOLD ME HE WAS MY BROTHER. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT ANYONE. I WOULD TAKE IT BACK IF I COULD. I MESSED UP. YOU'RE MINE, AND I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM TAKE YOU FROM ME. ABBY, GO UPSTAIRS AND PACK A BAG. WHERE ARE WE GOING? DO IT. OKAY. IT'S ALL IN THERE -- $150,000. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE GIRLS AND GO. Natalie: I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. NAT, LISTEN TO ME. AS LONG AS THIS CASE IS OPEN, CORNELL CAN KEEP INVESTIGATING IT, AND SHE'S NOT GONNA STOP. YOU SAW WHAT SHE DID TO ME. SHE'LL DO THE SAME THING TO YOUR SISTER, ONLY WORSE 'CAUSE SHE'S A CHILD. I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN. MOM, THIS IS CRAZY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT THING IS. IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME. TELL THE TRUTH. FACE IT. SHE'S 12. SHE CAN'T FACE ANYTHING. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE BOTH CONSIDERING THIS. EVERY DAY FOR 16 YEARS, I GOT A LECTURE ABOUT CONSEQUENCES. WHAT HAPPENED -- NATALIE, STOP. JESS IS IN JAIL! I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. I'LL GET HER OUT. TOM'S DEAD, DAD. HOW ARE YOU GONNA TAKE CARE OF THAT? I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU. I AM STILL YOUR MOTHER. YOU ARE STILL A MINOR. I DON'T CARE. I WON'T GO. AND IF YOU TRY AND MAKE ME, I WILL CALL CORNELL MYSELF. NATALIE! NO! COME ON. WHERE DID WE GO WRONG? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. WE LOVED HER. WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF HER. WE TAUGHT HER RIGHT FROM WRONG. DID WE? ABBY'S GONNA NEED HELP. SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT SHE'S DONE. ARE WE DOING THE RIGHT THING? SHE'S OUR DAUGHTER. SHE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE THAT STARTED WITH ME, AND I GOT TO FINISH IT. HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT? BY GIVING CORNELL WHAT SHE WANTS. NOW PACK. YOU GOT TO GO NOW. NO, JUST KEEP THAT UP FRONT WITH YOU. WHERE'S NAT? SHE'S NOT COMING. THEN WHAT'S GOING ON? ABBY, PLEASE. MOM? DAD, YOU HAVE TO COME. WE HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER. WE CAN'T RIGHT NOW. YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY? BECAUSE I HAVE TO STAY BEHIND TO PROTECT YOU. HONEY. [ Voice breaking ] I'M GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN, RIGHT? AS SOON AS I CAN. I LOVE YOU, DADDY. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. I PROMISE. ABBY, GET IN THE CAR. COME ON. IN THE CAR. OKAY, GO. GO. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ INHALES SHARPLY ] Natalie: DAD, THIS IS WRONG. YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME. I HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR SISTER. SO, WHAT ABOUT ME? DON'T I COUNT? YOU DO, SWEETHEART, IN MORE WAYS THAN I COULD EVER TELL YOU. WHICH IS WHY IF YOU DECIDE YOU CAN'T BE A PART OF THIS, I UNDERSTAND. BUT I'M ABBY'S FATHER, TOO. IT WAS MY JOB TO RAISE HER RIGHT. AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, I FAILED. SO, WHATEVER SHE'S DONE, IT'S ON ME. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. Y-YOU DIDN'T FAIL ME. NAT, YOU'RE AN AMAZING PERSON. I'M AFRAID IT'S IN SPITE OF ME. PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. NATALIE... [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] [ Sobbing ] OH, GOD. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. [ Crying ] I LOVE YOU, TOO. I LOVE YOU. WHAT'S GOING ON? NAT NEEDS SOMEPLACE TO STAY FOR A WHILE. CHRISTY WILL CALL YOU AND EXPLAIN. WHAT ABOUT YOU, BEN? DO YOU NEED HELP? NO. BUT THANK YOU, MICHAEL. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] NOW, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS? I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. [ SIGHS ] THANKS FOR ALWAYS HAVING MY BACK, MAN. [ SIGHS ] I LOVE YOU, BROTHER. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] RIGHT THIS WAY. MR. CRAWFORD? I'M HERE TO CONFESS TO THE MURDER OF TOM MURPHY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? DID YOU FORGET YOU'RE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL? WHY ARE THE COPS CALLING ME INSTEAD OF YOU? I DON'T NEED YOU. I ALREADY TOLD THE COPS WHERE TO FIND THE MURDER WEAPON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M CONFESSING. I KILLED TOM. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. I SAT HERE FOR HOURS WHILE YOU TOLD US WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. I LIED. I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS, BEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO, JOE. YOU'RE FIRED. YOU'RE A FOOL. I'LL BE REPRESENTING MYSELF. CAN WE GET STARTED? YOU DO REALIZE, MR. CRAWFORD, YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN CLEARED AS A SUSPECT IN TOM'S MURDER. YOU WERE WRONG. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. IT'S JANUARY 2, 2015,  12:30 P.M. PRESENT ARE ANDREA CORNELL, HOMICIDE, AND BEN CRAWFORD. I LIED TO YOU. I DID KNOW TOM WAS MY SON. ONCE I TOLD CHRISTY THAT I SLEPT WITH JESS, I KNEW IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SHE REALIZED THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LOSE MY FAMILY. SO, I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO. I USED NAT'S KEY, LET MYSELF IN. TOM TRUSTED ME. HE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ME ANYWHERE. I TOOK HIM INTO THE WOODS, AND I KILLED HIM. THEN I WENT HOME, CLEANED MYSELF UP, AND WENT OUT FOR AN EARLY RUN SO I COULD BE THE ONE TO DISCOVER HIS BODY. WERE YOU VERY ANGRY WITH TOM? NO. I JUST DIDN'T WANT CHRISTY TO FIND HIM. THEN SIX BLOWS TO THE HEAD SEEMS A LITTLE EXCESSIVE, DON'T YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I...HIT HIM. I WAS DRUGGED. [ KNOCK ON WINDOW ] [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] CAN YOU GIVE US A SECOND, PLEASE? Man: YES, SIR. I GOT IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DETECTIVE? I'M LISTENING TO A FALSE CONFESSION. WHAT I HEARD WAS YOU ABOUT TO TANK MY CASE. HE'S LYING TO PROTECT HIS DAUGHTER. OH, CAN YOU PROVE THAT? ABBY OVERHEARD HER PARENTS ARGUING ABOUT JESS MURPHY. SHE WAS MAD AND JEALOUS. TOM WAS THE SON THAT BEN ALWAYS WANTED. ARE YOU FINISHED? BLOOD SPATTER SHOWED THAT THE VICTIM WAS STRUCK BY SOMEONE NO TALLER THAN 5 FEET. ABBY CRAWFORD. AND WHEN I PUT AN EXPERT ON THE STAND TO TESTIFY TO THAT, THE DEFENSE IS GONNA SHUT ME DOWN BECAUSE OUR LAB WAS COMPROMISED. ABBY WAS ON A BUS THAT DROPPED HER OFF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CUL-DE-SAC RIGHT BEFORE THE BLUE JACKET REAPPEARED AT JESS MURPHY'S HOUSE. SHE PLANTED THE EVIDENCE TO FRAME THE BOY'S MOTHER. A LITTLE GIRL ON A BUS? MOM TOOK THE KIDS AND SHE LEFT. ABBY MISSED HER DAD. END OF STORY. YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY. I ASKED YOU FOR A CONFESSION AND A MURDER WEAPON. CRIME TECHS JUST BROUGHT ME THE FLASHLIGHT, SO NOW I HAVE BOTH. CRAWFORD'S GETTING 25 YEARS TO LIFE. THAT'S A WIN ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. HE DID NOT KILL TOM. THIS CASE IS CLOSED. AND IF YOU KEEP INVESTIGATING, YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR BADGE. PUT THE WRONG GUY AWAY, YOU CAN HAVE MY BADGE. [ BUZZER ] Man: RIGHT. YEAH. CAN YOU GIVE US A MINUTE? YOU GOT IT. YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE. [ BUZZER ] I CONFESSED. IT'S OVER. YOU'RE NOT PROTECTING ABBY. SHE HAD THIS PLANNED FOR SOME TIME. SHE DIDN'T JUST ATTACK TOM OUT OF AN IMPULSE BECAUSE SHE OVERHEARD YOU AND YOUR WIFE ARGUE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS PREMEDITATED MURDER. SHE LURED HIM. SHE TOOK HIM DOWN TO THE RIVER, AND WHEN HE PANICKED, SHE HIT HIM ON THE HEAD REPEATEDLY. THAT WAS RAGE, AND IT WAS A RAGE I WITNESSED AT THE FIREWORKS. YOU WERE THERE. I CHASE KILLERS. SHE DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY DROP HER PHONE. SHE SAW THE AFFECTION BETWEEN YOU AND JESS, AND THEN SHE SMASHED HER PHONE TO THE GROUND. Abby: AAH! ABBY IS CALLOUS, SHE'S UNEMOTIONAL, SHE'S VIOLENT. SHE INJECTED HERSELF INTO THIS INVESTIGATION AGAIN AND AGAIN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? ABBY'S A CHILD. SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. BEN, NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK, PUTTING MY DAUGHTER AWAY INTO PRISON WAS THE HARDEST THING I EVER HAD TO DO. THIS WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. IT WASN'T A MISTAKE. ABBY BRUTALLY KILLED YOUR SON. AND IF YOU LET HER GET AWAY WITH THAT, TOM WILL NOT BE HER LAST VICTIM. IT WAS MY FAULT. I KILLED TOM. [ CHAINS JINGLING ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ DAMIEN RICE'S "IT TAKES A LOT TO KNOW A MAN" PLAYS ] ? IT TAKES A LOT TO KNOW A MAN ? ? IT TAKES A LOT TO UNDERSTAND ? ? THE WARRIOR, THE SAGE ? ? THE LITTLE BOY ENRAGED ? ? IT TAKES A LOT TO KNOW A WOMAN ? ? A LOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HUMMING ? ? THE HONEYBEE, THE STING ? ? THE LITTLE GIRL WITH WINGS ? ? IT TAKES A LOT TO GIVE ? ? TO ASK FOR HELP ? ? TO BE YOURSELF ? ? TO KNOW AND LOVE WHAT YOU LIVE WITH ? ? IT TAKES A LOT TO BREATHE ? ?

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] Barrett: HELLO. HOW DID YOU HEAR? I WAS DOING A CONSULT AT THE, UH, JAIL WHEN BEN CRAWFORD WAS BEING PROCESSED. OH, SO, YOU'VE COME TO PICK UP THE PIECES? I KNOW YOU HATE TO LOSE. DIVORCE MEANS NEVER HAVING TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF. I'M JUST HERE TO LISTEN. OR TO TALK YOU OFF A LEDGE OR WHATEVER YOU NEED. LET'S JUST DO A POST MORTEM. FATHER PROTECTS DAUGHTER WHO UNINTENTIONALLY COMMITS A CRIME. NO. THAT'S WHAT YOU TRIED TO DO WITH JENNIFER. IT'S DELUDED MAN COVERS FOR PSYCHOPATH. SHE'S 12. KILLERS ARE GETTING YOUNGER EVERY YEAR. HE THINKS HE'S HELPING HER. THERE'S NO TREATMENT. HER BRAIN IS STILL DEVELOPING -- INTO A BETTER KILLER. [ SCOFFS ] THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. YES, THERE IS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. I'M GONNA PUT ABBY CRAWFORD AWAY. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY, ABBY. WHEN'S DADDY COMING? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS SURE JESS WOULD MOVE AWAY. WHAT? NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I JUST GOT TOM TO THE RIVER.
