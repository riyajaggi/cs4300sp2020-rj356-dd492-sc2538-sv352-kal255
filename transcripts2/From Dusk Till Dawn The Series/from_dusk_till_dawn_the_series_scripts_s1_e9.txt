 I know what's going on. Good, I'm glad to hear that. You just drive. If I was you, I'd drive to Quincy. Pick roads where I could go pretty fast without making anyone look suspicious. Jesus! - Seth, wake up! - What. Come on, get up! - What's that smell? - Come on, we got to get out of here... Come on! Come here... here. Dad! No, we gotta help Dad!

 - Come on! - No! Dad! No, we have to help him! Dad, Dad! No... No! The Gecko brothers are back. That's howl like it... Set me free... What is wrong with you? This is not who you are. You know, my entire life, I have felt like I've owed you something because you pulled me out of that fire. You and me... we're done. It hurts, I know. I know.

 It's all just part of your awakening. I need those. Part of you must die, Richard. Let it go. What is it, baby? Don't you want me to set you free? I didn't want to hurt you. Oh, please... you so wanted this. You wanted it bad. How about a little role playing, huh? Would you like that? It'll be fun. I'll be you... and you... be... me. Yummers. Now you're getting the hang of it. The worst is over. Holy shit. I'm 20/20. And it's only the beginning. It's another dead end! - What? - Or the beginning. - We went in a big circle? - No, no, no, no, no... the inscription. It's the beginning of the ancient words. It's a reference. To the creation myth in the Popol Vuh. Rebirth. Renewal. Rebirth. Renewal, rebirth. What are you doing... Don't touch things, in here... Please. What did you do? Oh, my... What the hell did you do? Okay. Hey... Do you see this? There's stairs-They go up. Up is good, right? Better than down. Yeah, fucking A. Oh, finally. Wait... Richie? He's still alive. He looks pretty good for a guy that just got shot. Oh, son of a bitch. What are you waiting for, huh? We're free... Let's get out of here. We can't leave without Scott. I can stay back. I'll help out. Get your hands off me, padre. I'm going to get my brother. You sure he's still your brother? Good luck. Where is she? Okay, Richie, look... I know it's not your fault. She played you, okay? Just tell me where she is. Uh... Sorry, brother. Things are about to get a little weird. You never told me. - What's that? - About mom. Well, maybe when we find Scott and we get out of here... I know what she did. The night of the accident. I know about the pills. How? This place. It showed me. That's why you were driving so fast. You were trying to get her to the hospital. So they could pump her stomach. I didn't want you and Scott to know... I didn't want you to ever know. No, of course you didn't. God, you carried this all on your own. You don't have to anymore. We're gonna go find Scott and then we're gonna make it out of here a family. Shh, shh, shh, shh. I heard something. Oh, Ranger Gonzalez. I'm glad to see you're still alive. Where's Seth? He found a way out. He went through a door with his brother. - Richie's alive? - Yes, sir. Come on... Let's get out of here. What are you all still doing here, anyway? Your son. Have you seen him? Ranger Gonzalez. - They got him. - You saw it happen-You saw him bitten? He tried to bite me. I'm gonna see for myself. You stay down here, you'll get lost forever or worse. I'm telling you what I saw... He's gone. Thank you for your concern, Ranger Gonzalez. But we're gonna go find my brother. You do what you need to do. Ah, damn it. What the hell is going on? I'm trying to get us to El Rey. Richard, you just bashed yourself in your own head. That other me is kind of a dick, okay? And he's not exactly real. No? Then how the hell do I know you are, huh? Maybe in death, I can finally give you the peace that I can't seem to give you in life. Seth, just let me explain. Please... Just please listen to me and let me explain. This is a trick. No, this whole thing is a trick. You can say goodbye to the money, Richard, because I am out. You got to be kidding me. No more tricks, Seth Gecko. But there will be games. Put that down, Seth, unless you never want to leave this temple. Temple? I stepped out the door and I was in the parking lot. You stepped through a door, yes. But you entered the ahk'abbih. - The who? - It's a labyrinth... It's like a maze. It's just a little different, although... Yes, I know what a labyrinth is, Richard, thank you. It's like the hedges in "The Shining." Except I don't see any goddamn shrubbery around here. 'Cause it's a labyrinth of the mind. It was placed here by the lords of the night. And there's only one path, but it's blocked... by rompecabezas - puzzles, games. And the only way to reach the center is to win. What's the prize? Me. No, thanks. Look, it's not just a temple, Seth, it's... - it's a prison. - No, no, no, no. No, this isn't a prison. This is an asylum. What was your sentence, huh? Five years? Hmm? Try 500. Well, what if I say no? You can't say no. When you walked through that door, it closed behind you. Hey, hey. If you want to make it out of here, it has to be through the labyrinth. Move. Seth left before the show started. Maybe he moved it. Right. Awesome... Maybe. That's it. That's the bag. What exactly did she say to Richie? Look, I told you. She said you're greedy. And that's why she's picking him instead of you. Look, I did my part. You promised you'd help me find my family. They are sewing their purpose in the temple, Scott, as you're sewing yours here with me. - No, no, but you said that you... - But nothing. Considering what I've done for you, I'd say a little gratitude is in order. You cannot go back to them. Just accept that you're different, Scott. Hey... Scott. You're better. Okay, so, let me get this straight. I get through this labyrinth and then I get to you? No, not to me. - To my blood. - What? It's inside something you would understand to be a vault. A sarcophagus. When we get it, she'll be replenished. And then what... You're cured? The hunger cannot be cured. But I will be free. Oh, really... To do what? Take your little show on the road? Murder and mayhem from coast to coast? That's... that's her big plan? Seth, we boost the blood, we deliver the goods and the job is done. - What job? - Soon you'll know. In the labyrinth, the trials are constructed from the memories of everyone in it. I don't know... Labyrinth, trials. This whole thing seems like a long way to go to keep a showgirl in a cage. It's a test, put here by the lords of the night. Whoever has the purity of mind to withstand the trials will be deemed worthy. - Of what? - No one knows. In five centuries, it's never been done. All right... When do we start? As soon as I leave. I can't go with you... The lords would know that I was there and... they don't like cheating. No self-respecting god does. Perfect. Well, good news is, you know the job. The bad news is, you got yourself busted doing it. - Oh, yeah, I wonder why. - We both know why. Just run it for me. The Parker Hotel. All the fabricated comforts of home for the well-traveled business executive, except this one happens to be a front for the Houston syndicate's money laundering operation. Run by none other than Big Jim Thompson. There's a rib joint in the lobby. That and the hotel are how he hides significant cash flow from illegal enterprises all over Houston. Every night, 7:00 sharp, Big Jim here likes to have a cold one and stuff his gullet full of Houston's finest slow-roasted pork. During that 30-minute window, the first man makes a delivery up to the counting room on the third floor. He sets off a diversion while the other man disables the security. As soon as that's finished, the two men converge onto the penthouse and start cracking the safe. That's where the real score is. $10 million in uncut diamonds. Good bet that's where the labyrinth is keeping the blood. Shouldn't be too much of a problem with all our new swag. No, no, no... No dice. We can't lug that thing all the way up there, okay? You got to go native... Touch and feel. Hey, same goes for the arsenal, all right... Keep it simple. We are at a severe disadvantage if we don't take these. Oh, that's right, it's a house of horrors. And one of my worst memories, thanks to you. I told you not to take that job in the first place. - Well, that was a good score. - With a bad mark. You only went after that guy 'cause Big Jim kicked Dad out of Houston. You made it personal, and that's why you blew it. No, I blew it because I didn't have the right boxman with me. Well, now you do. This place can throw whatever it wants at us and it doesn't matter. You know why? 'Cause the Gecko brothers ride again. You kept them on you? The safest place I could think of. I had to let her do it, Seth. I was a dead man. - Is being her slave any better? - I'm not her slave. No, then what are you exactly? I'm your brother. Okay, this is the drop spot. My guy's always on time. There we go. So that's how it is. What? The bodyguard... He wasn't on the original job. I did time with that guy. Son of a bitch kicked the shit out of me in the yard. Labyrinth of the mind. Is that Pritchard? He wasn't there, either. Yeah, well, he's here now. Probably because the labyrinth knows that I hate him. All right. Hold on a second. This isn't a video game. There's no reset. You die and you're dead. Ah, you clean up nice. - Eat me. - Seth Gecko? Nice night for a walk, Warren. I'm gonna need that cash. - Not so fast, Bluto. - Are you sure you want to do this? Why don't you go ahead and toss him the bag while he thinks about it? You heard him... Toss it. Chop, chop. What? No... No! No, no, no... Richie, just get the money. Just get the money. Hey... I just wanted to say thank you. - For what? - Helping us find my brother. Yeah. You don't believe he can be saved, do you? I know what I saw. But I've been wrong about a lot of things I saw today. What do you mean? I've been tracking a serial killer who I thought was Richard Gecko. Richie? What did he do? He killed a woman in that motel. But I think someone made him do it. I believe that. Richie's a tortured soul. And after all I've seen today, who knows what kind of torture he's been through. What? You see the good in people. Oh! It's so bad. What is that smell? It smells awful. What was that? We're not alone in here, guys. Oh, God. Stay close. Dad. - Just go... - Shh, shh, shh, shh. We got to get out of here... Go, let's go, let's go. Wait a minute... - Sex There's something back there. - We were just over there. - Come on, come on. Come on, get out... Good God! Get off me... Get off, get off! Kate! No! Hey... Hey, over here! Get away from my daughter! Come on! Come on... Run, Kate! - I'll get her... You get Jacob, okay? - Got you. Run, Kate! Where the hell should we go? Dad? Oh, God. Hello? Hello? Dad? I got you... You're okay. - Where's my dad? - We'll find him. We got to get out of here, okay? - Okay. - Come on. Guy nearly broke my neck with his bare hands. I don't know what the hell this is, man... This... He was not that strong in prison... Not at all. He wasn't a culebra, right? No... No, he definitely was not. - You missed a spot. - Hey, I couldn't help it. - Yeah? - Something came over me... I had to. - You had to what... Had to, what, feed? - Yeah. - You couldn't control yourself, huh? - No, I couldn't! What? Jesus Christ! - What the hell? - What? Your f... Woah... I'm Pritchard? - Shit. - Yeah, all right, all right! How the hell did you do that? I don't know... but I could feel it in my body. It's like it was tearing me apart. You saving me for dessert? We were gonna keep you around for inside information, but there's been a change in plans. You're going to serve a higher purpose. You've got two choices. One... you stay here and watch that designer suit rot off your bones or... you can help me stop what's coming. J "J" Okay... 30 minutes on the clocks. By the time you disable security and make your way to the penthouse, I'll go make the drop in the counting room. - Except for one problem. - What? Do I look like the goddamn Chamber of Commerce? Oh, great, another blast from the past. Worse... The security room is right behind him. J "J" What do we do now? Got a better idea. What are you doing? Whoa, hey... What the hell do you think you're doing? Tactics, brother, tactics. What? I hope you know what you're doing, brother. I'd like a word with Big Jim. Yeah. Most people wait to sit until I tell them to. Well, I'm not most people. I'm a boxman. Best one since Ray Gecko. Now, there's a name that I haven't thought about in a long time. That's probably because in my business, I make it a point to forget the losers. Ah, well, you're gonna remember me. I've got your next big score. You ever been to Brazil? Excellent food... Even better women. The fact is, they've got some of the most beautiful, beautiful women on the planet down there. But did you know... that some of those women aren't really women at all? The fact is... Brazil is home to one of the largest populations of transsexuals in the world. They got... they got so many, they even got a tour bus, a special tour bus in Rio and it stops at this one particular street corner and there's women all over the place and everybody in the tour bus looks out at them and then places bets on which ones are actually women, which ones are actually men. And then when all the bets are placed, these women lift their skirts and they show us their business. I hear they got nice beaches, too. I have never lost a single bet. You know why? Come here. That is because I know that just because you might see two big jugs up here... that don't mean that there ain't a pork sword down below just waiting to take you for a ride. Now, you tell me, young man, why exactly should I gamble on what you got under your suit? Because if I was working for you tonight, I would have been smart enough to check a thiefs bag for a hidden compartment. And if Lord Humongous had done his job correctly, you wouldn't be in danger of a sex change yourself. Boy, you got some cajones, don't you? I like that. - Boss. - What? No, don't worry about it... it's Pritchard. He'll make his delivery. I got some business to attend to. Meet me upstairs in the penthouse in five minutes. We'll talk it out. So, Vance, you have anything else on me? Just get the hell out of Dale, I don't care what the hell you do. - Sir. - You're being robbed. - You're kidding me. - No. Move your ass... Time's running out. I forgot to tell you, I got some girls. Damn it. How do I get out of here? You want your supper? Then sit down and do what you're told. You know the drill. It ain't gonna put itself together. - Oh, so that's the game we're playing, huh? Shit! Shit... come on. There... Your colt 1911 pistol fully assembled. - Now open the door. - Too slow... Do it again. Big Jim is asking for you. You have no idea what I live with day in, day out. The things I got to do for you and your brother. - The least you can do is clean my guns. - Clean my guns, yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard it before. Not fast enough. Can you do it faster? I can't hear you. - I can do it faster. - Good. 'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna take this bottle and I'm gonna bust it over your melon head. You think you're such a king shit. You're nothing but a wise-ass little prick. You're a bitch. You and that retard brother of yours aren't gonna amount to squat. Irish twins. Born a year apart because your miserable mick mother wasn't allowed to use birth control. But, damn, he couldn't wait to get you out of her belly. Yeah, couldn't wait to get away from you, either. What did you say to me? I said... she couldn't wait to get away from her drunk, pathetic excuse for a husband. You got a mouth on you. You know whose mouth it is? Your mother's. Oh... the things she could do with that mouth. Well, guess what. She couldn't stand the sight of you. She got one look at you boys and she ran. Now do it again. That's got to be faster. You really think you can save Richard? Well, you can't. Your mother knew what he was just like I know. He was a bad seed. What's that smell? Lighter fluid. Same thing you smelled on your brother that night. No... Richie saved me from that fire. Seth, wake up! Right after he set it. No! You're a liar. I was a lot of things, Seth... but liar... wasn't one of 'em. Richie betrayed his own blood. Seth, wake up! Come on, we got to get out of here! What's that smell? You really gonna let him get away with that? Yeah? It's for you. A for effort, boxman. But I know a Gecko when I see one. And sooner or later, we all dance with the reaper. Tactics. All right, come on, come on. All right. What are we doing in here? We need to go back. No, no... Hey, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. This is the most sacred room in the temple. Chances are if we wait here long enough, they'll come to us. Okay? - We'll be safe here. - Okay. Wow. It really is incredible to have lectured about a place for so many years and finally be standing in the middle of it. Well, I'm glad it's been such a thrill for you. This place really freaks me out. Oh, well, it shouldn't. Human sacrifice has really gotten a bad rap. It's not all about the blood. It's a simple exchange, really. A pact with the gods. What are you talking about? Where's your sword? They knocked it out of my hand. How the hell are we gonna get out of here... You don't have a weapon. - Apparently, I can take a bite. - Assuming that's all they want to do is bite. I got a knife. Where the hell's my knife? - Tanner took it. - Why the hell would he take your knife? These people believe that with enough sacrifice... the vision serpent would grant them ascension to the next realm. And it all happens right here. He's obsessed. Where's the knife... Did you take it? It belongs to the lords of the night. He has been the entire time, since the beginning. You know, when we were in that room? It was-it was like he was getting his kicks out of seeing my Katey up on that altar. He took her. He wanted to separate us. Why? I'd all but given up on finding this place. But then Ranger Gonzalez called me and he sent me on my path. And along the way I met a new friend... and he told me what I should do. Buenos dias, professor. We got to get the hell out of here. I've already lost one kid... I'm not gonna lose another, especially to that psychopath. What the hell was that? Scott? No! We've all got our part to play. Are you ready to fulfill your destiny, Kate? Fuck you! Give it time... you'll come around. No-don't! Seth Gecko. Fancy seeing you here. Go on and git... I'll deal with this one. What, are you gonna do something bad, Seth? Oh, go on and drop the money on the table. Pete, I think we got off on the wrong foot... What do you say? Damn right. - Now take a step back. - Okay. How's it feel to be on this end of the muzzle? Well, it isn't the first time, probably won't be the last. It's a shame I got to blow that confidence away on that pretty suit of yours. End of the road for los hermanos Gecko. Be cool, Seth... You be cool. - We've got a problem. - What? - Give me the code. - Only Pete knows it. Okay, okay, okay. What's the price of a nice bottle of hooch? What's the price of a nice bottle of hooch? Fourty-si... four... What the hell was that? Get downstairs... I'll cover Big Jim. Move! The hell happened? Not bad for a Gecko. Where have you been? Here. Waiting... Just like you. You think they'll succeed? Richard's soul is pure. I'm sure of it. Richard. He's quite a find. Do you trust him? Richard thinks I'm in love with him. He would go to the end of the world for me. Who wouldn't? I did. I've had a little trouble securing the money. What? That's unacceptable. I completely agree. So you don't know where it is? Why would I? My job was to take care of Richard. And you were supposed to take care of the money. Well, I cannot find it. I think our trickster brothers are trying to pull a fast one. Don't worry, mi diosa. When the Geckos emerge from the labyrinth, we'll find out exactly where everyone stands.
