  [santanico] and now begins the ancient word.
  The sun sleeps below the sky,
  And the world turns upside down.
  In the night, we make our feast.
  For centuries I danced for them, the blood-gatherer,
  The bringer of souls.
  I've brought them the lost ones,
  The troubled ones, the desperate ones.
  Now I am free,
  And the world turns upside down again.
  They are thirsty for revenge,
  And nothing will stop them.
  No boundaries, no borders.
  They will come for me,
  But I am coming for them.
  Their empire of blood will fall,
  And I will not rest until it all burns.
  [saw whirring]
 [speaking spanish]
  No talkie!
  You can get rid of that.
  You don't have to stop there.
 It's payday.
You know about our
bonus program?
  [buzzing sound]
 Damn, you've got
a tight little body.
 A dancer's body.
 Maybe you can dance for me.
  ¿baila para me?
  That's my specialty.
 You speak english.
  [hammer cocks]
 A private dance
will cost you.
  You want to see her paperwork?
  Okay, places, everyone.
  Copy that. I'm set.
  Wait for my signal. Dex?
  Jacked in from out here.
  It's working like a charm.
 Shut down cameras.
  [dex] copy that.
  [muffled groan]
  Hey.
 You're running cash
in your trucks, mister...
 Balthazar ambrose.
 What are you,
a hanna-barbera character?
 We're here to take it.
  You ain't takin' diddly.
 Actually, that's true.
  You're gonna give it to us.
  [shrieking]
  I asked her to leave the drama at the door.
  I've been around culebras all my life.
  [powerful growl]
  Well, look at you.
  They let you in the club?
  I'm not of the tribe, if that's what you mean.
 I like my summers on the beach, thank you very much.
  I sure as shit know your ways.
  I know you two, now I've seen you in action.
  You're the showgirl who thinks she's going to take down an empire.
  No.
 I'm just going to kill
the emperor.
  -Good luck with that. -This isn't your fight.
  Make it easy on yourself.
  Take us to the loot.
  Tell your boys to step off.
  It's all right, guys. It's okay.
  Just want to see the cash truck.
  Want my best guys out here to help unload.
  Where the hell is it?
  It's coming.
  Still grosses me out, kiddo.
  Put 'em on ice, get ready for transport.
  His lordship's going to want that sweet ass back on stage, pronto.
  [dramatic music]
  [man screams]
  -Meatpacking plant. -Just outside houston.
  Pretty sure it's part of the syndicate.
  Did a little recon, but now it's time for the real work.
  I want you with me.
 Not another stakeout,
please.
  So, uh...
  That whole thing.
  That was new.
  -You didn't like it? -I didn't say that.
  Good.
  Oh, boy. He's back to the turquoise.
  This guy's got a bolo collection
  Like uncle eddie's video stash.
  This one's got nice aiguillettes.
 Richard, it's daytime.
We should be sleeping.
 Like that guy
in that moving picture
you made me watch,
 With the tuxedo.
  Belushi?
  Lugosi. Bela lugosi.
 I would like
to sleep like him.
  We've got to do this. This is why I came back.
  His operation is connected north of the border.
 There's no borders
for this man.
 Just find and kill him.
  We need him to make a move.
  We've got to jack this place.
  We hit him where he lives, find out where he lives.
 Look for the man in black
with the dirty smile.
  I asked about a cartel that comes at night.
 We're not a cartel.
  Ask enough grunts, they'll tell you.
  There's an outfit real deep in houston.
  They've got pot houses, count houses, stash houses.
  But none of the product is actually theirs.
  They just hold, transport, deliver.
  And take their cut.
 They don't take.
It's given to them.
 For centuries,
it's tribute.
  -Tribute? -Tribute, yeah.
 Of all the nine lords,
malvado was the pochtecatl.
 Collector of tribute.
 When their armies would
destroy your village,
 They would take everything,
 Take what was theirs:
 Women, gold, weapons.
  Children.
 When they took you,
they took you completely.
  He who dies with the most toys wins.
 Amancio malvado...
  Doesn't own anything.
  He possesses it.
 When he has you,
it's like...
  The air you breathe is a gift.
  He who dies with the most toys wins.
  He never dies.
  What are you looking at?
 I'm captivated by the show.
 Let me know if someone
stops to watch it.
  [chains rattle]
  [man] jefe.
  He's here.
  -[speaking spanish] -jefe.
 You call this a show?
 You insult me.
 You disrespect her.
 Until she's back,
this place is shut down.
  Jefe, there is a thirst.
  We need the souls this place provides.
 This was her palace.
  And hers alone.
 You are nothing
but a descarado.
  Jefe, I meant no disrespect.
  [fearful panting]
  [groaning]
  [screaming]
  Come in.
  [distant sirens wail]
  Hey, no lights. Get down.
  [man shouting in spanish]
  [knocking on nearby door]
  [banging on door]
  [man] ipolicía! Ipolicía!
  -Are they gone? -Shh!
  [vehicles depart]
  [man speaking spanish]
 Yeah, I was just
taking a shower.
  Kate! Kate!
  I'm fine. I was just reading the bible and praying.
  Okay. Sorry. I had to make sure you were safe.
  Servants of god need all the protection they can get around here.
  Don't I know that. Thank you.
  No.
  All good!
  Gracias. Bueno.
  What the hell was that?
 That was you obfuscating.
  I meant the check cashing store.
  -What happened? -Nothing.
  Things got a little dicey, that's all.
 You said everything
was going to be
lean and mean.
  I don't know that I used those exact words.
 "stroll" was
the word you used.
 "I'm going to stroll out
like paul newman,
 And we'll drive away
like we got a free toaster."
  -I owe you a toaster. -Not funny.
  The manager tried to be a hero.
  Some knucklehead called his cousin, a cop.
 How was he able?
Weren't you keeping
an eye on him?
  I only have two eyes.
 You need more.
You need a partner.
  Will you stop? We won.
  Here.
  Huh?
  -These are canceled checks. -What?
  -Unbelievable! -Son of a bitch!
 Three months of stupid towns
and the same old bullshit.
 It's been a downhill slide
since the corvette was stolen.
 I feel like
I joined a circus.
  Okay, I get it.
 Maybe I would have been
better off alone.
 I would have made
a killing as richie's
knife-throwing girl.
  We still have the cash.
 That is not enough.
 You said it.
We need passports,
we need new names.
  I want out.
  And go where?
  To find scott.
 I said I would forget him.
I can't.
  Listen to me very carefully. He's dead.
  Even if he's alive, he's dead.
  -I don't believe that. -Forget him.
 Like how you forgot
about richie.
 Your brother
found the best vein.
  That's hilarious.
 Would you rather
he turned you?
  [grunts] no, he can keep that venom shit to himself.
 You found your own venom.
  Moron.
  [richie] well, well, well.
  Sun goes down, things get busy.
  Culebras?
  I can't tell.
  They got their own lou ferrigno.
 Their own qué?
  That is one big bastard.
  He doesn't own you anymore.
  You know that, right?
  We do this job like all the others.
  Malvado's got nothing to do with this.
  Leave the drama at the door.
 You think he would?
  Get what I'm saying. There is no room for error here.
 I just want to do it.
 Too much thinking.
Too much planning.
  We can never have enough of that.
  We are going to need a couple of helping hands, like last time.
 Do we get to feed on them?
  What's the rule?
 No eating civilians.
  Then, yes. You shall be fed.
  [richie] huh. The late shift.
  Think we found our way in.
 I am not wearing that.
  Cheers, gents. Let's talk turkey.
  You two will be strictly driver and lookout.
  After that, options may expand.
  You look like a couple of smart comers.
  This is an opportunity not to be missed.
  News said the geckos made it down south with thirty mil.
  What you doing up here?
  I got bigger plans.
  -Bigger than thirty mil? -Potentially.
  Forget it. Thanks for the cold one.
 [dex] jimmy!
  We always said we'd kill to work with the geckos.
 This ain't the geckos,
it's a gecko,
 And it's the dumb-ass one.
 Why would I want to do
a gig with the dumb one?
  Ever seen a picture called the train? It's a war movie.
  Nazis are occupying France, but the war is coming to an end.
  Burt lancaster plays this resistance guy.
  There's this ss colonel, paul scofield.
  He wants to keep all the great works of art.
  He puts them all on a train and hires guards,
  And they're going to ride to berlin.
  He can't do it without lancaster, a train guy.
  -You said resistance. -He's both.
  He's not going to let them get away.
  He does everything he possibly can.
  He doesn't eat. He doesn't sleep.
  He doesn't even let the broad into his pants.
  And this is jeanne moreau!
  She's got sex and musk coming out of every pore.
  Big burt keeps little burt in check
  Because he's got a hard-on for this train.
  Then he gets a hard-on for scofield.
  Scofield's got a hard-on for picasso and gauguin.
  Even at the end, when burt wins
  And all that priceless shit is spread all over,
  That ss bastard says it all belongs to him,
  The only one who understands beauty.
  You believe that?
  He's probably right. Lancaster, he's just a train guy.
  But he's also holding an mp40,
  So he stares at him, and just sprays him.
  Cuts him down. Turns around, walks away.
  Drops the mike. Lancaster out.
  If you want to know which gecko I am,
  I'm the dedicated one.
  The one on a mission.
  I get to keep all the art on the train.
  If you want a piece of that, your call.
  [faint music playing]
 [speaking spanish]
  To you? Fifty pesos.
  Five dollars, u.S.
 No, I'm not a tourist,
 I'm a student of anthropology
at alamo state.
  You're young for college.
  I'm gifted.
  [speaking spanish]
  -You know scripture. -You're here to convert me, you people.
  -"you people"? -You're a missionary.
  You came down here to help the little brown people.
  Want a selfie?
  -Not the king james version. -Not exactly.
  [praying quietly]
  [kate] who is she?
 No one knows her real name.
 Many believe
she was called kisa
by the ancients.
  -It means-- -sunlight.
 She's our savior.
She consumes our sins.
  -Santanico. -What did you say?
  She consumes stuff, that's for sure.
 She is not your savior.
  Who made you the expert?
 People like you,
when you attacked my family.
 You call yourselves culebras, right?
 Little bit snake,
little bit vampire.
 You crave blood and can
stand sunlight, but it hurts,
 Like holding
your breath underwater.
 And if you or your friend
decides to bite me...
 You'll have two choices.
 You can either kill me
and consume my soul,
 Or pump me full of venom
and turn me into something.
  Who wouldn't want that?
 I am not here to convert you,
so do not convert me!
 My father was turned
into something like you.
  -You looking for him now? -No. I killed him.
 He didn't give me
much choice.
 It's my brother
that I'm looking for.
 He was changed,
and he needs my help.
  How could you ever help him, princess?
 He's just a boy.
 He's going to have to feed,
if he hasn't already,
 And I want to help him
live with that.
  Like them.
  You assume everyone here is like us.
  This is a shrine to la diosa.
  She belongs to all of us, not just culebras.
 I want to know
if you can do it.
  Do what?
 Not feed on people.
  Wouldn't recommend it.
  Around here, it's not hard to find people who cry out
  To become a little antojito, or big meal.
  [distant chatter]
  [rafa] he extorts everyone in the mercado.
  He and his matrona make a lot of money off our backs.
  That's the way of the world.
  Is he--?
 Then why don't you finish him?
  I pick my battles. You should learn to pick yours.
 When you look at a tattoo,
you're not really seeing it.
 You look at it through
another layer of skin.
 The ink is in the dermis,
which is
  Under the epidermis.
  -Did you know that? -Yeah.
 How come
you don't have a story?
 Usually people come in,
they want to get paint,
 They've got a story,
a reason.
 They want
the yin-yang symbol
'cause...
 They need to keep
their shit in balance,
 Or, I don't know,
their dog died.
 Those are always
the sad ones,
 People trying
to remember somebody.
  -You trying to remember somebody? -The opposite.
 Gotcha.
 What happened to you,
anyway?
  I got bit, by an...Animal.
 That's a story
I want to hear.
 All right, finito.
 Keep the bandage on,
and ointment on it twice a day.
  -That's way too much. -This ain't the only ink I want.
  I need some official documents.
  I asked around.
  Somebody told me to see sonja at la casa de los...
  Tatuajes. That's "tattoo"
in spanish. It's what I do.
  Yep.
  I need passports.
 Who's the little girl?
  Just a little girl.
 I'm glad you're
not your brother.
 Who am I
to screw over a gecko?
 Wouldn't be
good for business.
 Come back tomorrow.
 I hear richie's
the crazy one.
 That true?
 You're supposed
to be looking that way.
 What's this?
  Something I've been meaning to do.
  Go on, open it.
  It's a tennis bracelet.
  It wasn't called that until the '80s.
  This tennis player, chris evert,
  Wore a diamond bracelet to the u.S. Open once, and...
  Well, that's it.
  Do you know what it was called before?
  An eternity bracelet.
  Truth is, I've never been part of a...
  You know, a thing,
  And now that we're a thing,
  I figured that this is what one does, right?
  Thank you.
  [distant television dialogue]
 [door lock rattles]
  Señor.
 I'm sorry.
I bring these for miss kate.
  Miss kate is not here.
  Okay.
  Why are you interested in her?
  Answer the question.
 She likes extra towels
for her hair.
  Still not an answer.
 She's a nice girl.
 She believes in god.
  Yeah.
  Yeah, she's pure.
  That's how you people like it, right?
 Señor?
  You're never around in the daytime, are you?
  Why is that?
 I'm night manager.
  Yeah, I'll bet you are.
  I'll bet you're real smart, too.
  Aren't you, poindexter?
  Do me a favor, huh?
  Stop checking up on her.
 Don't threaten me, señor.
  Oh, yeah?
  You gonna show me what you really are?
  Come on.
  Show me.
  That's it.
  [hissing]
  [bestial growl]
  [shrieking]
  Hey. You're home early.
  Yeah.
  I got you extra towels, for your hair.
  Oh. Thanks.
 I think I found our next hit.
 We have to do our homework.
It could be a good score.
  You know how much I love those.
 Shower sounds
like a good idea.
 We'll talk after.
  Okay, perfect.
  [malvado] I want you to dance for me.
  I want them to see how beautiful you are.
  In every way.
  They will not be able to resist.
  Man nor woman.
  They will come from far and wide,
  To be captured by your eternal beauty.
  Make them yours.
  Make them your slaves.
  Release yourself.
  Let them see inside of you.
  Let them feel you.
  Release yourself.
  Yes.
  [speaking spanish]
  [heavy footsteps]
  Richie.
  Richie, get up.
  Let's go. It's too cold in here.
  [gunshots]
  [gunshots]
  [bestial roar]
  [growling]
  [equipment whirrs]
 What the hell happened
in there, man?
  It's all good.
  Get this loaded on the truck.
  [speaking spanish]
 It's a beautiful thing.
  Yeah.
  Hurry it up.
 You all right?
  He's using trucks to ship people back to mexico.
 The twister's closed.
 There's a thirst.
  That's how we find him.
  We follow the flesh.
 Follow the flesh?
 It'd be better
if we had our own.
 We could track 'em,
use 'em as bait.
  That's a great plan.
 I can get you
a different style.
  Richard...
  I can give you what you want, but not what you need.
  Not until I'm finished.
 [jimmy]
sorry to interrupt.
 This gig was nice.
 So nice,
it's gonna pay me twice.
  How you figure?
  Security tapes.
 We never shut down
the cameras.
 We've got footage of
you two robbing the place.
  You didn't watch the tape?
 Don't need to.
We heard the shots.
 So, we're not only
getting the loot,
 We're getting a reward
for information
 Leading to the apprehension
of richard gecko.
 Well, in this case,
his dead body,
 Which was found
 Right next to that
of his hot beaner girlfriend.
  Baby, tengo hambre.
 Just one bite.
  Really?
 They've got to last us.
  Holy fuckin'...!
  Can't believe I missed it.
  Security tapes. It's the one thing I should have been on.
 See? All that thinking
for nothing.
  I should have done more.
  Can you imagine if this had gotten out?
  Every lawman's still looking for the geckos.
 Then we make them
stop looking.
 If we are gonna fight
this war,
 We have to be stronger.
 We have to shed
the old skin.
  [santanico] however lost we might feel,
  We have to find our way in the night.
  To do that, we have to disguise ourselves.
  Our new face might appear the same to others,
  But something has changed--
  Because it has to change, richard.
  We have to start over.
  We have to let go of who we were,
  To become who we are.
  [malvado] I want you to dance for me.
  I want them to see how beautiful you are,
  In every way.
  Make them your slaves.
  Let them see inside of you.
  Let them feel you.
  [speaking spanish]
  Lárgate.
  [speaking spanish]
  It's been too long.
  Long enough.
  ¿qué pasó?
  Santanico.
  She's gone?
  She was taken. Two brothers.
  Some people say it's prophecy.
  I say they're already history.
 Time to regulate.
  You look good, my friend.
  Claro que sí.
  [rap music plays]
  You know I'll never make it out.
  Pues entonces, good luck.
  [exertion grunts]
  [cries out]
  Gonzalez.
  Wake up. We've got big doings out here.
  What?
  Get out to the quarry. See you soon.
  It's your lucky day, ranger.
  -Morning. -What's going on, brother?
 You might want to see.
Think you can I.D. These two?
  Mmm.
 Aw, shit, man!
  -What are you looking for? -Being thorough.
  It's them.
  You sure?
 I mean,
they're pretty crispy.
  Without a doubt.
  These are the boys that killed earl mcgraw.
 We can finally put
a nail in that coffin.
 Shit, man.
 Stick a fork in 'em.
They're done.
  Or they're just getting started.
