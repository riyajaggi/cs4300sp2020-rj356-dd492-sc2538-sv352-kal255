 Richard. Richie. Hunt me down... Richard. Hunt for me. Richie... Richie? Jesus, is that you? It's Warren, Warren Pritchard. Your brother sent me to find you. Could you just put the knife down, please? Thank you... He's got a job, it's a big one.

 Hey, are you all right? Come on in! You heard me, devil dogs and bad bitches! Come on in for the all-you-can-lick buffet of the most beautiful, tastiest delicacies south of the border! We've got only one item on the menu, that's true, but we've got every flavor under the Mexican moon! I did my part. We got you across the border. I'm not taking my children inside. - We're done. - Fine. You three stay out here with the devil's rejects, have your own little Altamont. Wasn't the deal.

 No, the deal was that we stick together until Richie and I finish our deal. Lalalalala! You heard me, devil dogs and bad bitches! Come on in! We got pan dulce of every flavor for you and any way you like it, with all the fillings - camote, pina, calabaza. Come on in and get it! Hold it, now... Hold it. A new item has just been added on the ala carte menu... sweet, hot... cherry pie. Okay, okay, easy, Tex... She's not gonna be on the menu. You leave that up to Cherry. Come on, baby, yeah!

You're gonna lose a lot more than that... rinche. I'm not a rinche. Oh, you will be. To beat the devil, you got to play his game. Can you see the way? Did Culebras do this to you? Oh, you figured that out all by yourself? You're lucky they didn't take my tongue. How can I find them? Follow the road into town. Like the pinches culebras they are, you'll find them at the place where there are many temptations. Many sweet temptations. J "J" Why is this here? It should have been taken hours ago. We're waiting for your approval, boss. If I ask for it, it was approved. Woah, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah, baby. Hey, eyes on the prize. They are. Carlos said we were gonna meet him at a bar, not his bar. - Yeah, so? - So? Look at me. You do not close a deal behind enemy lines, Richard. You do it on neutral ground. You have the bonds, right? Yeah, I got it tucked right here in my Fruit of the Looms. - No, they're in the RV. - Well, then stop your whimpering... You control the board. Do I? J "J" Tonight everything must be perfect. That's the Twister, boss... We got this... We always do. Tonight is not just any night. There's gonna be a war. And only the strongest survive. Are you strong? Yes. I can't reach that busy little bitch boy and I got to tell you, I don't like the looks of this place, all right? - I don't like the way it looks at me. - What? I don't know, I just feel like I'm coming out of my skin. Something ain't right here... I can smell it. Okay, Seth, you got to listen to yourself, 'cause you're starting to sound like the crazy brother. J "J" Not for me... - and not for them. - Relax, Red Ryder. These buckaroos earned their bonus. So did you... Drink up. Dad, can we? Absolutely not. Come on, Pops... We're a band of brothers now. Crossed the desert... Didn't even need Omar Sharif. As I recall, he killed a man for drinking out of the wrong well. Yep. I love that scene. We're not your brothers, we're not your family. We're your prisoners. - Dad, don't. - It's all right, little lady. You see, papa bears grumble. That's what papa bears do. You think you're in control 'cause you got the keys? Think you're on top of the world. But you're not... You're on the bottom. And you're scared. And you think you're better than me. You too good to have a drink with a common thief, is that it? Now, like it or not, we are a family. A broken, messed up, sad excuse for a family. But, goddamn it, we got love for each other, don't we? Love and forgiveness. That's how you get through the day, right? J "J" So, here goes, sis. I left some bodies on the ground back in Kansas. Now, no doubt they were good men and true, but they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and they stood between me and my freedom. So I did what I had to do. I did what anybody would do. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me? - I can't hear you. - I... - Yes. - Yes, what? I forgive you. Bingo. Good job. Now you. - Now me, what? - Confess. Well, I've never killed anyone. Well, you must have done something real, real bad, right? Something real, real bad that Papa Bear here never, ever dreamed of. Not even in his late-night cable-TV, soft-core dreams, I bet? Hmm? - I caught her once... - Ah! Got to come from her. Show time... We're all waiting... What do you got? I French-kissed Kyle in the back of the church. Whoo... Wow! Preacher's daughter playing tongue hockey in the house of the Lord. Did you get religion, hmm? Don't answer that... We'll leave that one a secret. And what about you, angel eyes? If you were a cowboy, you'd wear a black goddamn hat. You think you can tear us apart... It won't work. Oh, well, that's 'cause they already heard your confession, right, padre? They already heard the gospel according to Daddy. Tie it all up in a nice, neat little bow for 'em. And lo, the marriage was falling apart, he said. That's why he crashed the car. You don't know a thing about it. Except I never heard a why, Padre. Why was Mommy and Daddy's love on the rocks, huh? You better stop right there. Or what? God's judgment's gonna come down on me? That's what you were spewing back at the motel, right? You said you had this coming. Put your glasses up. Up! Here's to the Book of Revelations. It's like angels pissing on my heart. So that's what that feels like. Well, I got to go see a man about a horse. Talk amongst yourselves. Share your, uh, sorrows, your joys. I don't really give a shit. Just remember... I have the keys. Go to hell. Like the pinches culebras they are, you'll find them at the place where there are many temptations. Many sweet temptations. That guy you belted back there called you a pinche rinche. Yes, he did. I know what that means. Aren't you just a fountain of knowledge? I'd have belted him, too. I caught some static when I first put the star on, But people like that need to know there's no rinches out there anymore. Just rangers. You tell 'em. I heard all the stories. The rangers made a bad name for themselves back then. That's why they call it the bad old days. Some Mexican would go fugitive and the rangers would take that as an excuse to ride around, shooting other Mexicans until they got their guy. Yeah, I knew some of them boys. Rinches. Yeah? Yup. Most of them didn't live long enough to be put out to pasture. Some of 'em stuck around, changed their ways... or didn't get caught. Like I said, that ain't now. We ain't got to shoot anybody in the back to make a statement. You think that's all it was? A bunch of Mexicans getting shot in the back? They'd hang them from willow trees in the crossroads, two, three at a time, set 'em on fire, dare somebody to come and cut 'em down. Teach 'em a lesson. What lesson? Sometimes... Even the worst kind of brutality has its place. And what place is that? Place of dead roads, last stop before hell. Senor? Mas café? Si. Hey! Yeah, whoo! Check it out. When was the last time you seen me do that? Congratulations... Now come on. Seth, I ain't leaving this place. Look. That beige monster sticks out like a third tit on a stripper, okay? Not exactly the best place to keep my money. I need you to keep watch while I stash it somewhere else. Oh, I'm sorry, that's funny? - You want to fill me in on the joke? - You just sat down to the table. It's a little early to fold your hand. Yes... Oh... That's right, baby. You show them why they call you Cannonball. I'll take a piece of that action. Step right up, Slick. Hey! You kept saying somebody was calling you here, right? What did you mean by that? Oh, now you want to know. Forget about it, Seth... You already had your chance. Yeah, whoo! Yip-i-vip-i-yip-ah! You again. I didn't break your nose back there, did I? Yeah, pendejo, you did. That's terrible, 'cause if you don't get out of my way, I'm gonna break the rest of your face, too. Sorry... ls something funny? That look on your face! This face? No. Shit. That one. Levéntalo! Pick him up! This is what we do with pinche interlopers! He's been gone a long time... Let's just go. We could hitchhike. Pay someone to take us to the border. No, I've put you in enough bad situations already without asking you to do something that could be much worse. We can't just stay here! I don't think we have choice. How can you say that, Dad? 'Cause Seth was right. He thinks this is judgment. Is that true, Dad... is God judging us? No... I'm the only one who fell from grace. Look, daddy, you're scaring me. I'm not trying to frighten you. Listen to me, both of you. We have to have faith in us that we can bear this tribulation as a family and that we might... Who are you trying to convince, us or yourself? I'm gonna go try and find Richie. He's crazier than his brother. Well, at least he hasn't lied to us. Senor. Venga. Numeros. Can you get me in there? Sí. Toma, mira. Mi dinero? Come on. Rinche, you're early to the party and I don't remember seeing your name on the list. But I knew you would find your way here. Shh, shh... No, no, no, no. Don't speak, 'cause when you use your tongue, it's so easy to lie. You've been carrying this for a while, haven't you? It's older than you think... ancient bone. And the blade, well... obsidian. So much more than steel. It's a dark mirror. It showed you things, didn't it? I think it did. Then I wonder, rinche... what have you seen? Show me. Kill these bastards. Felicidades! Rinche, Margaret is a beautiful woman. She is beautiful. And that baby girl... mmm... scrumptious. Now I'mma do something for you and give you something that your mama never did, and that's a choice. Gutted like a puerquito or maybe a quick surgery at the joints, huh? Qué quieres- What you want? Oh, Well. I guess it's dealer's choice! You... But no, no. No... He broke my nose, he broke my nose. Untie him and go. You're a long way from Kansas City, Mr. Gecko. Lost your way, Little Bo Peep? Then again, I guess there's enough sheep in this place to follow you. Wait a minute... I know you. - I got to go. - No, hold on a second. Your legs must be tired. You've been walking around my mind all day. Well, I'm gonna keep walking. Well, now, are you here all by your lonesome? No, I'm not. Well, if any of these hooligans give you a hard time, you just tell them you're with Sex Machine. Sex Machine? I bet it shoots blanks. Yeah, whoo! Who's next? You? I'm next. Hunt me down, Richard. Hunt for me. Are you her? I'm whoever you want me to be, chulo. Say my name. Richard. Richard. Say, "Set me free." Mmm... Set me free. Say, "I want to drink you up." I want to drink you. Up. Something's up. That's enough-Get up. - What do you want, Kate? - I need your help... - I need you to get us out of here. - I'm sorry... It's not up to me. Thank you for, you know, saving my ass back there. Not a word about it. You seem to have me at a disadvantage here. I mean, you know my name, but I don't know who I'm thanking. Call me Narciso. . Okay- - I have only two questions for you, Mr. Gecko. - Yeah, shoot. - First... how, after avoiding hundreds of policemen to get here, did you find yourself surrounded by those pendejos in the parking lot? Uh, well... you know, my Uncle Eddie always used to say you're never in a fight with only one asshole. - Why is that? - Even assholes have friends. Hmm... Nice. - To Uncle Eddie. - Good, old Uncle Eddie. The second question, and perhaps the more pertinent one. Yeah. Why would a man with such good sense agree to pay $10 million to a piece of shit like Carlos? No... Relax, Mr. Gecko. I make it my business to know things. Well, then, you know my deal is with him. What are you getting out of it? First-class ticket for me and my brother to El Rey. El... Jesus Christ... Everybody's in on the joke tonight? El Rey. It's a myth, amigo. So much for your good sense. Are you saying it's not real? I'm saying it's not for you. - Oh! - I want to hear you scream. I would stay and watch you get taken apart, slice by slice... but I have other plans. I know. There are nine houses. They're all coming here tonight for that snake bitch statue you have n that cheap shrine. Como? You're afraid of 'em all. But one in particular. He's gonna wreck everything you worked for. Didn't your piece-of-shit knife show you that? You're not the only one who saw something. Who is it? You give me the Geckos, I'll give you a name. Narciso. You surprised me. I don't like surprises. Tranquilo, cabrone-I'm coming. The Geckos are here. Yeah, Seth keeps calling me like a pussy-whipped gabacho. Tell me something I don't know. How about he's in the VIP booth with Narciso, talking like they're old friends? Take your time with him. Find out what else he knows. You want us to save you a piece, jefe? The tongue. You don't need us... You're here to make some stupid deal. - It's Seth's deal. - So, then, let us go. I mean, all you have to do is get the keys from him. - Richie. - I don't want you to leave. I want you to see this place for what it really is. I want you to feel what I'm feeling. You said that you were lost. I was alone, too and when I had nothing left, she found me. She called to me, and she led me here. You said that your life was upside down? Well, maybe this is where you're really supposed to be. But h... How could I belong here. I mean, look at this place. You're not looking close enough. Under the surface, it's really beautiful. I don't see it. It's because you aren't looking close enough. - What does it feel like? - What does what feel like? To know that you... to know that you belong, really? It feels like home. Please. Please let us go. Just let us go home, Richie. Set me free. Why did you say that? Oh, my God. Preacher's daughter strikes again. Kate? - This is what you've been doing? - Kate? Playing "you show me yours, I'll show you mine," huh? Kate? Richie, will you listen to me, goddamn it? Don't even start... I'm not leaving. Yeah, look, I'm sure there's another titty bar somewhere else in this goddamn country, all right? I'll get you a VIP card and a couple of girls just shy of their quincenera. I'm your goddamn brother, and you treat me like I'm he ugly step kid in the attic. If I say we stay, we stay and that's it. Why don't we throw for it? Huh? Let the knives decide like old times, yeah? I win, we walk. You win, we stay. Uh. I'm sorry, Margaret. Sorry, Earl. - I tried, Goddamn it, I tried. - Céllate, pinche rinche. Sometimes even the worst kind of brutality has its place. - And what place is that? - Place of dead roads. Last stop before hell. Works better if he's wet. There's gonna be a war. Only the strong survive. Are you strong? You will never, ever touch my family! Do you know who I am? I'm the rinche. Shhh. Hey. Come here! You tricked me. You want to make it up to me? Yes. - Si, sir. - I bet you know where Carlos is. His club. I don't see her. She wouldn't leave without us. That's enough. Listen to me... This whole day has been a horrible mistake. We've been on edge since we've come across those bastards. And because we're all still reeling from the loss of your mother, I said it was judgment, but I was wrong. It's just bad luck. Now all this talk about judgment, don't you pay it no mind. But it is true. The border-patrol agent told me as much. What are you talking about? He knew things about us, about me. Dad, I don't think today is a mistake. I think it's all happening for a reason. Get up. What... Why? 'Cause I'm gonna get us out of here. Could I... could I help you, friend? Are you heading out? Yes, sir. Just rolled my last number for the road. This really ain't my scene. Yeah, I hear you on that. It's lonely at night. I spied that, that fire... It's like a beacon. So I pull over, holed up for a while. But I guess it's time for me to go. Well, sir, could-could I impose on you for a lift back to Texas? I can pay you. Listen, friend I'd be willing to give you a lift... if you'd be willing to share. - We got a deal? - That's my son. I like 'em young, too. Dad. ♪ Ay cucaracha ♪ What's going on out there? He's not with Narciso anymore, if that's what you're asking. He and the brother are throwing knives. Good, 'cause we're about to start. Make sure that everything and everyone is ready. And return this to its rightful owner. Ooh! Real smooth, Richard. Okay. Yeah! Your move, brother. Why don't we make it interesting? What are you doing? Richie wins, you give me the keys and let us go. And if he loses? Well, then, I guess I'm stuck here, literally. - No way... I'm not doing this. - Well, you don't really have a choice. It's your eyeball. You need to try this one. Thank you. - Where did you get that? - He just gave it to me. No, the first time... Where did you get it the first time? - I told you... I won it in a contest. - From who? Don't worry about it, bro, 'cause you're about to go down. Keys. You need to sit down. Now. Richie, answer the question. Who gave you the knife? - What does it matter-It was some guy. - Yeah, who? Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come. Please take your seats. Welcome to the Titty Twister. We have a special performance for tonight... is a very, very special night. That's him. Please welcome the Mistress of the Macabre. - What? - That's him. That's the guy who gave me the knife. The queen of the night... Santanico Pandemonium. She's real. She's real.
