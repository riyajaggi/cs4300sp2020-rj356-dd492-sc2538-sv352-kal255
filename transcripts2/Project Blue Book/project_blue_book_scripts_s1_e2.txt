  Previously  on "Project Blue Book"... You want me to investigate flying saucers? I want you to help me prove to the public the truth -- They don't exist. The public knows there's something going on now. Need I remind you we don't even know what the hell we're dealing with here. And what does your husband do? I can't really talk about it. There's something you need to know. I think there's... ...something more going on.

 What are you not telling me right now? Come on! This way! Kids, that is enough of this nonsense. Mama, Will's not making this one up. It fell down right out of the sky. Lord Almighty. Dallas! Will! Kids! Will! Dallas! Lori! Here, girl! Will? Dallas! Everybody thinks I'm crazy. Logic...can't begin to explain what we're dealing with here.

 Coordinates. Hon, you have a visitor. Oh, yeah, just one second. You locked it? Did I? I didn't realize -- Hey, Doc. Lovely home, by the way. Thank you. Can I get you any coffee or something to drink? Well, I wish I could stay, but thank you. Boy, how'd you manage that? She's way out of your league. What are you doing here? Well, we missed the last flight out, so we got to drive now. Drive? Where? Sooner we hit the road, the better. Where are we going? I just got off the phone with the generals. Seems a woman and her kids saw a spaceship crash down near their farm in West Virginia. Claimed they saw the alien that was piloting it, too. Mom? Joel. Are you ready for school yet? Do you -- Whoa. Are you the Air Force pilot my dad is working with? Well, you must be Joel. Put 'er there, soldier. Did you kill a lot of bad guys in the war? Joel -- Well, yes, I did. For my country. That's so cool! How many people did you kill? Like -- Like 100? Captain, I'm sorry. Joel, he doesn't really understand -- Well, when you're fighting a war, you don't always have time to think about things like that. My dad didn't really fight. He...invented a kind of tiny radar -- Captain, would you wait outside, please? Well, there were lots of ways to contribute to the war effort. Nice to meet you, Joel. You too. Mrs. Hynek. Joel, your mom and I need to talk for a second, okay? I have to go out of town again. For how long? I don't know. What's going on? I can't really say. So is this how it's gonna be from now on? You keeping secrets from me all the time? No, it's not a secret. It's just I... I don't want you to worry, that's all. Mimi, everything is fine. I promise. So, according to the mother's account, she and her children saw something red streak across the sky. When they went to investigate, they came across a spaceship and an "alien" 10 feet tall. Do people normally report aliens? No, they do not. Not since Roswell. There's something that's not in that file. After folks in town heard Sara's story, they put together this militia to hunt down the "space creature." You're kidding. And when they didn't find one, they turned on her. On Sara? Why? Basic psychology. Fight or flight. They don't find an alien, they figure Sara's a liar, caused a panic. So what's she really after? If there's no good answer, then she becomes the monster. Is that the militia? Jesus. I didn't realize they were camped out at her house. Let me handle this. Hello there, sir. Just trying to get through. Who are you? Government business, Chief. Step aside. Sara call you? That woman's crazy, you know? She put the whole town in a panic. Well, we're trying to fix that. Like your boys did in Roswell, huh? All of you, back away from there! God damn it, Donnie! J-Just sayin' hello. I know why you boys are here. So how long is this gonna take? We haven't assessed anything yet, Captain. I'm afraid we can't answer that. Well...you just hurry up, then. Let 'em through! Next time, Doc, let me do the talking. Sara, it's Captain Quinn. We spoke on the telephone. This is Dr. Hynek. We work together. You're a doctor? Mind your heads. I gotta keep it dark down here. The light hurts their eyes now. They started complaining about it just after we saw that thing in the woods after the spaceship crashed. Mama? It's all right. There's a city doctor here now. Didn't affect me, but they just keep getting worse. Doctor, please tell me what's happening with my babies. You know, I got a boy about your age. Loves to read comic books. - What's your favorite? - "Travelers of Mystery." I'm not supposed to read it, though, 'cause Mom says I get scared sometimes. Because you got a good imagination, I'll bet. That picture you drew... of the alien. Do you think that could have come from your imagination? No. It was real. On the night this took place, what exactly was the first thing that you remember? Well...the kids saw the spaceship first. By the time I got there, it had already crashed. Set the whole forest on fire. The monster... it had these big, round eyes. Looked almost human, but it was so tall. I-It might've been trying to talk to us, but we just ran. Miss Downing, could you take us to where this all happened? You should be more careful. Dyed your hair this time. I rather like it. I have a date I need to get ready for. Perhaps you can make yourself useful while I'm gone. Yes, ma'am. I'll leave you the address. Don't be sloppy. This is it. This is the spot. After we ran from the monster, we saw parts of the spacecraft scattered all around. One of them must've been the engine 'cause it was still glowin' when we saw it. Like a ragin' red diamond. Y'all must think I'm crazy. No, no, not at all. Thank you, Miss Downing. We'll take it from here. Geez. What happened here? Captain? Yeah. Surface soil's loose. This entire area's been jolted somehow. Like an earthquake. I thought you just studied the sky. When I was seven, I contracted a severe case of scarlet fever. Didn't leave my bed for almost a year. I read the entire "Encyclopedia Britannica." Twice. Hey, Doc. This was a forest fire. Someone probably dropped a cigarette, place went up, kids saw a branch fall or something. You see something? What you got there? Hold this. This. Uh, yeah. It's like I thought. These branches, they're broken from impact, not fi-- Guess your "Britannica" didn't teach you about climbing trees, huh? Okay? Yeah. Hello. Don't you look lovely. Come in. Nope. Well, I-I have coffee and donuts. No. Maybe you should tell me what you want. Oh, that is a longer conversation. But right now, I want you to grab your purse, get out of the house, and show the new girl some of the local hot spots. I'm the new girl in case you were wondering. Well, I guess that makes me your tour guide. Come in. I just need a moment. I won't be long. I'm just -- I'm just grabbing my coat. All right! And I think -- I think I'm ready. Okay, we're good. Let's go. Thank you. Okay. What is that? Geiger counter. What do you need a Geiger counter for? .27. This is extremely elevated. Captain, can you help? What the hell is that? That is part of the alien spaceship. Or, as Sara called it, the "red diamond." All this for a meteor? Hey, Doc. Just let 'em work. I just want to be sure they know to check its isotopic composition. They're professionals. What's under the tarp? Come on, we got to get back, let Sara and the kids know we're done here, release a statement to the press. Move that cargo to hangar 63! You clear? Come on, Doc. Let's go. So, are where are we going, missy? What would you like to see? No. Movie theater. Museum? I don't know. Let me think. Well, there is... this one place. Yeah? They read poetry, um, serve cocktails in soup cans, and smoke reefer. I've never been. I've only heard of it. I don't know what to say, Mimi. I'm sorry. Was that too much? I love it. You are my kind of girl. All right, so how do we get there? Okay. Head up to Fairmont, hang a left, then three streets to Reynolds before you go down -- Oh, my God. What was I thinking? You should've driven. You know where you're going. Good idea. Just pull over. We don't have to stop. Slide over. You trust me? Now reach around and grab the wheel. Put your foot on the gas. You got it? Uh-huh. All right. Ahh! Whoo! All right. Now you're in charge. The red streak across the sky, the fire in the woods that started at the treetops, the pungent mist, all of it does point to something extraterrestrial. Lord, I knew it. It was a meteor. What made everyone sick were arsenic fumes. The skins burns could have come from the level of radiation present if it was uranium or thorium. Even if you didn't touch it, the area was toxic enough to have had that effect. But the good news is that it's temporary. You are all going to be fine. But what about what we saw? A meteor can't explain that. Well, I didn't say that it did. And I'm not trying to discredit your account. I'm just taking things in a step-by-step -- Hey, Doc. Can we... We have what we need to write up the report and close the case. Not everything. You found a meteor. What more are we looking for here? Something to explain the creature. You read the case file. There was one other witness. Hey, is this really how it's gonna be with you? Okay, here we go. Cheers. Cheers. What's in this? It's called a Coffin Nail. I'm guessing a little bit of everything. You probably came to this kind of place in New York all the time. You don't like it here? I didn't really know what to expect, I guess. It's just so... Different. You know what I think it is? You just need to loosen up. You want to loosen up, you just need a little help. Stay here. I'll be right back. Okay. Here? You want to feel all right? Don't be shy. We told Evelyn you were coming but I'm not sure what you'll get. She still thinks Lincoln's president sometimes. Miss Myers? Evelyn. Miss Myers, my name is Dr. Hynek. We're from Washington. We understand that you saw a -- an entity of some sort a few days ago... that you reported to the authorities? Is this what you saw? Yes, that was it. And when I looked into its eyes, it showed me the end of all things. Okay, Miss Myers, thank you for your time. The others that came to see me before you believed me. What others? The men in hats. They were scared. So should you be. We learned a valuable lesson today here, Doc. When I say a case is closed, it's closed. And we are never coming back to West Virginia. Beer's getting cold. It's a joke. Hey. You really think those kids were lying? And Evelyn. She described the same creature at the same time near the same location. I mean, one person reporting a monster, you can let that go, but two? Did you not hear what I just said? Yeah, "case is closed." Yeah. So why are you still... Let me ask you something. Since we never covered this in our initial interview. Because I guess I just assumed. Thanks, Carl. You don't actually believe an inch of this could be for real, do you? You mean do I believe Sara and her children are telling the truth? No. Do you think it's possible extraterrestrial life exists? Statistically, the probability of us being alone in our universe is zero. But scientifically speaking? Well, given the finite speed of light, the vast distance between the stars, any visitation is... improbable. What do you keep looking at over there? Sara talked to the press. It's one thing to hear a rumor, Captain. Another thing entirely to have an alien on your front page. ...tell us on her own. Jesus. Now this whole town's gonna be in a panic. Hear that? Now they want answers from her. This makes them think Sara's the problem. It's a -- It's a -- It's a witch hunt. Fight or flight. We have to get back there right now. Sara come on out! It's time to settle this! We know she's telling lies there, right? Hey! Step away from the house. You're back. Still gonna tell us how to run our town? Easy there, clodhopper. I told you boys this is a local issue. We don't need your kind here. Well, now you've found some real trouble. New plan! From now on, I'm the man in charge. Any questions? Donnie? No. Do as he says. Go check on the family. Sara, it's -- it's -- it's okay. We're here to help you. Yeah, just look at all that help I got outside my door right now. I understand why you published the drawings. I do, but -- I had to. You didn't believe me. No one did. And now it's backfired and they all think I'm the monster. But I looked the alien in its eyes! Mom. We are not crazy. We saw something in those woods from somewhere else. And it was real. You're failing me down there. It's just a little hiccup right now. - Ain't goin' far, Sheriff. - It's under control. The sheriff wants to call in  the National Guard. Does that sound like it's "under control" to you? This is the kind of "hiccup" that makes national news. Do you understand that? I'll talk to him, sir. Oh, you better do  a hell of a lot more than that or you can kiss that post in D.C. goodbye. What'd Sara say? Well, she's not changing her story. Great. So we're both gonna be out of a job when we get home. We're leaving? This town will eat itself alive. Well, you want to go hunt down a non-existent alien in the woods? That's about the only way we can quiet things down. There's gotta be an explanation. I need to clear my head. What are you doing? Do we have a flashlight? Now, what the hell do you need a flashlight for? Come on! Hey. What are you doing? An experiment. You gonna tell me what the hell we're doing out here already? Testing a theory. Now hide. This is crazy. No, please, hide. Behind me. Take a good look, Captain. We have just found the Flatwoods Monster. Doc, you're a goddamned genius. You've all heard the story about what happened in the woods that night. About what Sara and her children saw. A spaceship crashing, creature inside it, aliens taking over the world. And most of you thought she was crazy. But everything she said... was true. That spaceship was a meteor. Even the Air Force scientists that examined it said they've never seen such a fine specimen. Thank you. And the creature... Nothing more than a great horned owl. Professor, would you like to take it from here? When hot air, such as the air heated by a fire, mixes with the colder air above it, the light refracts in different directions. That's why stars twinkle. How mirages are formed in the desert. And also how any of us here could see an owl in the middle of a burning forest and claim it was a monster. Instead... take a good look. Resemblance -- it's unmistakable. And the only logical, scientific explanation. Thank you very much. Thank you. - One more for "The Daily News." - This way, please. Captain. Captain, get in, please. Sheriff, just one more, please. Can the family squeeze together a little bit? Excuse me! Hello! Hey, Doc! Lunatic! It's time we get you home. No. We need to make one more stop first. He told me you'd be back. Is he -- Is he here right now? The man in the hat? Please. Sit. So, the case is officially closed. Hynek really came through  in the end. Happy to hear that. You must be as well. He's a little stiff, but the professor knows what he's doing. Why don't you stop by  the offices on the way home so we can meet him? I'd love to.  I bet you would. So it looks like you got worked up over nothing. It's never nothing. Not anymore. He left this for you. I don't understand. Who is this man? How does he even know me? He only knows what you want. The truth. But the truth is like the sun. The closer you look, the more it blinds. Find what you were looking for in there? Look, professor, you're still new to this, so let me give you the answers to the exam, okay? Spaceships, aliens, all this stuff we're asked to investigate? The Air Force knows they don't exist. So our job is to provide a rational explanation for what the public sees and move on. Well, there are still things about this case that I just can't account for. What? Like crazy lady in there? Look, you're the astrophysicist. Stick to the science. I'll stick to the psychology. That way, there is nothing that could come out of that sky that you or I can't explain. Professor. Professor? I'm sorry. What were -- What were you saying? That General Valentine and I will be working together on Project Blue Book. So you'll be hearing from the both of us a lot more. Yes, of course. You're doing your country a huge service. You know that, don't you? I trust Captain Quinn has explained that to you? Thoroughly. Good. Is a meteor all that we found? At the site. It seemed to me there may have been something...else removed. Something larger? Is he not up to speed on our protocol and discretion? He is. Most definitely. Did I miss something? There wasn't a larger sample? You know, if I could just take a look for my research. In case the captain didn't dot all the I's and cross all the T's, your research is now our research while you work for Blue Book. So I want to say, "Thank you for your help." Oh, and regarding your compensation. If you sign that, we can get you paid. You can drop it off on your way out. Gentlemen? Sir. I look forward to working with you. Oh, thank you. Five, six... Triple letter score. Pretty good. But... I have Q-U-A-S-A-R. Hello. Dad! Allen. Mom let me stay up till you got home. I was getting worried. I'm sorry. It's just -- It's -- It's been a long couple of days. Did it go all right? Yeah, I'm just glad to be home. Hey, Dad, what's in the box? And so, it occurred to me on my drive home that, uh, tonight was the opposition of Mars. That is the point in Mars' orbit when it passes closest to Earth. And when I was your age, it was Mars that first got me interested in astronomy. This was my comic book. Go on. Have a look. Whoa. Dad. So cool. And I got something for you as well. Well, I haven't been able to buy you anything nice in a while. And...I just thought with the extra money. But I've got to say, it is a little more dangerous than I was anticipating. So you think you're gonna keep doing this? It's Blue Book, right? Hello? Good. I caught you. Wanted to see how you were doing. Me? Well... It's good to be home. I bet. Listen, um... what happened with Evelyn -- that's gotta be making you second guess the whole thing. I don't want you to give up. You're good at what you do and I'd hate if something like this made you change your mind about the job. I just think the authorities need to be investigating her death. Already checked in. Orderly there  told the sheriff that she jumped out  an open window. Had a history  of hallucinating, too. Probably explains the other  business with the alien. Hallucinating. Yeah. Could have went off her  medication that day as well. Just one other thing... ...next time you have  a question for the generals, ask me first, okay? It'll make both our lives  a whole lot easier. Okay, Captain. Whatever you say. Great. All right, so tomorrow. See you bright and early. I think the doctor will perform his role rather well, don't you? You don't think so? There's something...off about him. The man saw a woman take a swan dive off a building. Even you'd be rattled. I just didn't like him asking so many questions. He's an academic. What'd you expect? I expect a scientist who wants to pick up a little extra cash would keep his mouth shut. Captain Quinn'll make sure he goes along with the program. You won't have to worry. It's our job to worry. That's fine. Let's just not get paranoid. We've got enough of that going around. The consequences of our actions impact every man, woman, and child on the planet. It's up to us to make sure that their fate is in good hands.
