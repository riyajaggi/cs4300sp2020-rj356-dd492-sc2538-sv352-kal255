Brimming with tears, I take you by the hand. Will we ever meet again, on that hill?

 “Episode 10" A picture book memento? Is that okay? I think it will be all right, but she is rapidly recovering her cognizance, so be careful what you say. Right. Whatever you do, don't stimulate her. Don't try to answer all of the questions she is going to bombard you with. Right. Is this-? I found it. Haruka? Is this new? Huh? Is it dirty? If you don't want it, I can go exchange it.

 That's not what I mean! That's not it. That's not what I mean. Takayuki-kun, my... Hey, now, Haruka, after all I went through to buy it, don't make that face. Things have been pretty tight this month, but I still worked hard to buy it for you. Takayuki-kun... I'm sorry. Thank you. Narumi-san... Akane-chan... I thought you went home. Sis is going to put it all together soon. You were listening in. That's a good thing, right? It's something we should be happy about. But, for some reason, I just can't bring myself to celebrate. Oh, sorry, I know that sounds weird. Um... I'm sorry... I'm all right. You have a fever. Are you sure your cold isn't getting worse? Have you taken any medicine? No, I'm fine. It's not really that high a fever... Come on. It's a good thing Dr. Kozuki was still there. Sorry about this. You shouldn't overdo it tomorrow, and stay in bed. It's so hard... Akane-chan? Why are you so nice? It makes it so hard. Nice, am I? I'm in love with Mitsuki. Or that's what I thought. But when I'm with Haruka, I just can't leave her by herself, either. I was supposed to be over Haruka now, too. And yet... I'm hopeless. “"Suzumiya" I'll be fine from here. I'm fine. Okay. Take care. Thank you very much. Narumi-san, it's not your fault. Anyone would feel that way if they had to see her like that. Good night. Hayase-san! Hayase-san! Yes? This estimate is wrong. Sorry, I'll rewrite it. Which part is it? Which part, you ask? It would be one thing if only the product names were wrong, but how can you mess up the totals, too? Don't "Eh?" me. This is wrong. I'm sorry. Where is it wrong? Don't give me that “Where is it wrong?"! It's okay. Just do the whole thing over. Right. Hey, your copies are done! Okay! Ishida-san... There's a call from your husband. Line 3. I told you not to call me at work. Don't you talk to me about that! I'm working! I need to step out for a minute. It's just like you heard. Things have gotten to be a real pain. It's because he was cheating on me. But then, these last few years, it's felt more like we were roommates than a married couple, so I figured this would be a good chance for us to split up. Sorry for sounding so grouchy, and for letting you see me like this. I feel the same way right now. Is that right? I don't know what I should do. Do you still love him? I see. Well, that's where we differ. I don't have any feelings left for him. All I have left is resentment. I'm not sure what your situation is, but if he isn't going to offer you an answer, then you've got to make a move. Try tossing a pebble at him. If it causes any ripples, he will make his move. Then you'll have his answer. Nothing is going to change if you're afraid to do that. I'm... . Not as strong as you are, Ishida-san. It's not a matter of how strong or weak you are. This is about your own good, from here on out. That's okay. He probably isn't coming back anyhow. You're minus-orientated, huh? You're the only one who might be devastated by this. He might not think anything of it. Are you okay with that? Can you accept that? Time is just going to move on if you do nothing. It's not going to solve anything. That's why I'm struggling. I won't know if I'm right or wrong right now unless I make my move. It might end up being a painful experience, but when I get my answer, I just have to give myself over to time. Just waiting around isn't going to change anything. I can't. Huh? The head office? Yes, Ito-san asked me to tell you. Anytime will be fine, he just said he wanted you to come See him at the head office. If you could tell me which day is convenient for you, I will convey that to Ito-san. Understood. You don't need to rush, but it might be better to make it soon. Okay then, I'll leave it to you. Takayuki-san, the main office has taken an interest in you? They're just shorthanded. And since dung beetles don't have any brains, they work hard if you flatter them. Whaddya think you're doing, bonehead!? Sorry, I don't have any brains, so I can't understand what you're saying. Hey, don't scatter your dung beetle germs around! Us humans won't be able to live around here! Shut up! As a non-human, you're the last person- Takayuki-san, have you caught a cold? A bit of one, yeah. Don't spread it around, or I'll curse you forever! I know, I know... Waugh! What are you doing!? Mayu-Mayu, let's get out of here before he contaminates us! Right! Takayuki-san, I'm terribly sorry about this, but I must leave with all haste. Contaminate? Wave I caught Akane-chan's cold? These are my... These are my... hands... right? Just waiting around isn't going to change anything. [just can't do it. Are you all right? Huh? Um, Hayase-san? I knew it! You're Hayase Mitsuki-san, from Hakuryo Hiiragi, right? We were in the swim club at Ichiritsu 2nd. We swam together at several meets. Wow, this is a surprise. Who'd have thought we'd run into you here? Uh-oh, your heel is broken. Good evening. Ah, the boyfriend. Huh? Does Amakawa-san have today off, too? Oh, well, I suppose so. Is it all right if I go over to Haruka's room? Oh, no, they said not unless the doctor is with you. Just a minute, I'll give her a call. Hello? This is Hoshino. Akane-chan... Thank you for yesterday. Are you all better now? Yes, thankfully. I can at least be sure of my physical strength. Yeah? That's good. Boyfriend, the doctor said she'd like you to wait for 20 minutes. Aota Kyoko-san? Yes, we were one grade behind Aota-san. Wow, she worked us hard! Right? I don't even want to remember! Aoto-san spoke often about you, Hayase-san. You were the only contestant she ever spoke highly of. What is Aota-san doing now? She's on Forex's swim team. I hear she's a shoe-in for the next Olympics. What about you, Hayase-san? I heard you had joined a trade team. Wouldn't it be a thrill if the two of you were in the Olympics together? It's quiet, huh? If only it could always be like this. Akane-chan? They're pretty. Are those for Haruka? Oh... yes... Narumi-kun! Sorry to keep you waiting! Sorry, I'm going to pop out for the night. Huh? Is there an emergency? I wouldn't say that, exactly. Sorry. Mm-hmm, all right. I'll cover for you. Leave it to me! Sorry about this. “Hayase Mitsuki" That'd be pestering... Hayase? It couldn't be. Is this all right? Hayase! What are you doing!? Who is this guy!? Who are you? Who are you!? Come on, let's go home. That's okay. Hayase? Leave me alone. What do you mean, that's okay? --Snap out of it! --Hey! Stay out of our way! Get lost! You stay out of this! Why, you-! Don't you mess with me! Why, you! Suzumiya-san, how are you feeling? What's the matter, Haruka? What day is it today? How many... days has it been? Haruka... Answer me, Takayuki-kun. Hey, what's the matter, Haruka? Don't evade the question! Suzumiya-san, calm down. Let's have a nice long chat. Lam calm. My hair isn't this long. My fingers aren't this slender. They aren't, are they? I'm not really like this, am I? Haruka, what are you talking about? Haruka, you're still Haruka, right? No! That's not what I asked you! What is today's date? What in the world is going on? Suzumiya-san... Tell me the truth! I'm begging you! Take it easy. You're terrible! Why won't you tell me!? I can't stand you like this, Takayuki-kun! I hate you! Haruka, you see... I hate you! Sis, you've been asleep for three years. It's been three years since the accident. You've been asleep that whole time, Sis. Akane-chan, don't! Really? What's more... Narumi-san is now seeing Mitsuki-sempai. Akane-chan! Everyone has been trying desperately to lie to you. --That's enough. --For your sake, Sis, since you couldn't remember anything! Stop! Even this is a lie! I'm not in middle school anymore! Narumi-san isn't in high school, either! It's all a big lie! This is all your fault, Sis! If you hadn't had that accident, nobody would have gotten hurt! Nobody! Haruka! Haruka! Haruka! Happy now? S- Sis... Down the road we would always walk home on, hand in hand, it won't let go. wish we could stay this way, but time keeps passing us by. Only draw one dream in the night sky- 1 want to be your star, someday. The midsummer constellations shine down on us as the two of us quietly pray that we can stay together like this, staying true to our feelings. The light has just been born within our two hearts. I'm so cold! We can't fall asleep. Sempai! Won't anyone come help us? I doubt they will. We're secondary characters, so no one will notice. I'm starting to see things. Like what? They're like, mwan, and pyon and... Somebody help us!! You dummies.
