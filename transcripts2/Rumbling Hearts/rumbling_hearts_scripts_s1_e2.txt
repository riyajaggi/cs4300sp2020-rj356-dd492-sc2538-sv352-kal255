W- what the-? 7 points, 5 points, 6 points, 4 points, 3 points, 5 points, 7 points... 37 points total. You're still a long way from passing. Hey, what are you doing, suddenly coming up like that? And what do you mean, 37 points? Sorry about that, Takayukhkun. Haruka? Then, this would be-?

 Mm-hmm, my sister. "Episode 2" Mm-hmm, my sister. "Episode 2" Suzumiya Akane. Nice to meet you, Narumi Takayuki-san, Y- yeah... Don't tell me she's coming with us today. Of course not. She's just tagging along with me... I think. Yeah, don't worry. It may be summer vacation, but I don't have time to get in the way of the two of you on your passionate date. Passionate? Come on now, Akane. Okay then, I'm off to the pool. Whoops. It's still too soon to be eating my sister, okay? Ah, he turned red! He's so pure of heart'

 Good luck! W- w- why you precocious little brat! Sorry, Takayuki-kun. Did Akane say something inappropriate again? No, not really. Is Akane-chan always that spirited? Mm-hmm. She's a little too spirited. That's it. Akane-chan is a bit like Hayase in her disposition. Maybe. You know what? Akane is in the swim club, too. Huh? Seriously? Mm-hmm. When she competes in tournaments, she wins. She says she's gunning for Mitsuki. I'm scared to think about what she'll be like when she's older. Are you okay? Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. Didn't you sleep? I was playing a game I borrowed from Shinji until morning. Oh no, that's not good for your health. How are your studies? Oh, not too bad. Takayuki-kun, you should test for Hakuryo U. Koyo U is so far away. Hakuryo U is so close. We could go there together. Even if you start now, if you really work at it, I'm sure... So Takayuki-kun, you really should consider Hakuryo U- We rode too far, huh? Mm-hmm. You should have woken me up. Mm-hmm, but Takayuki-kun, you looked so comfortable sleeping, and your face is so adorable when you're asleep, I couldn't help myself. Is that right? Sorry about that, Haruka. You know what? I brought something good for us. should we sit down somewhere? Mm-hmm. Great, it didn't fall apart! Oh, meat pie! It looks delicious! I heard that you liked meat pie, Takayuki-kun. Actually, I've been working on them since quite a while before that, but I wasn't very good at it. I'm not too sure about today's, either. If it doesn't taste good, don't force yourself to eat it, and tell me so, okay? Yeah, you got it. Well? --Delicious! --Really? Mm-hmm. It's really delicious. Ah, thank goodness! I'll have some, too. You're right, this turned out well. This is nice, huh? This is nice, huh? Yeah, it is. Ew, no way. I'm serious. 50, about today... What shall we do? Listen, come on in, if you like. Yeah, but... You probably wouldn't be comfortable, huh? No, it's not that... Welcome home' A- Akane! Oh, I'm so hungry. Huh? What are you doing? Hurry and come on in. Uh, I was just... Are you coming in or not? Which is it? 3, 2, 1, go! N- no... It's already so late, and it would be rude for me to suddenly barge in, so... You don't have to worry about that. H- hold on, Akane! I'm home! And I brought a guest! Um... Narumi-kun, you don't have to be so stiff. Well, help yourself. If you don't have enough, please say so. I'll cook some more. Akane! Enough, already! I'm sorry, Takayukhkun. Come on now, Akane. Huh? Hey, Big Brother, you were just thinking of something dirty, weren't you? Why, you-! For crying out- Big Brother? Uh-huh. Is that strange? No, it's not strange... I've always wanted an older brother. I might not be able to expect much from you, but I'll make do. Oh, you will? So, Big Brother, make sure you marry my sister, okay? Akane! What are you talking about!? Future plans aside, Narumi-kun, as long as you're seeing Haruka, take good care of her, okay? We'll leave her in your care. Y- yes, sir! Are you okay for the festival tomorrow? Can you go? Mm-hmm. I had my curfew extended. But Mitsuki said she had something to do, and couldn't make it. Something to do? Did she find a boyfriend, or something? Oh yeah, that's right... What is it? You know what? I heard that Mitsuki did find a boyfriend. That's why. Huh? Seriously? Mm-hmm. Akane said she saw her with a boy, and the two of them were walking around town. Ah, there she goes. Well, tomorrow, just the two of us will go. And Shinji- we can leave him out of it. That wouldn't be very nice to Taira-kun. It's okay. Well, tomorrow then. Hello, this is Narumi. I'm not in at the moment. If you need to reach me, please leave a message after the beep. "Hayase" Hayase! Why didn't you answer your phone yesterday? Oh, so you called me back. Well, I got three messages from you. Did something happen? Uh-uh, not really. Could I talk to you? Is this about your boyfriend? --I don't have one. --I heard you did. We were just walking together. But yesterday, he professed his love for me. Are you going to go out with him? I don't know. Tell me, what do you think I should do? What should you do? Whatever you decide, I'll back it. Yeah... You're right. You know, I hate to say it, but this will be the tenth person to profess his love for me. But I turned them all down. What are you, bragging? No, silly. I'll slug you. They all say they like my hair. But I dislike it. This hair is what I dislike about myself... the way I'm so stubborn. There's only been one guy up to now who hasn't said he liked it. He said I'd look better with short hair. How do you feel about this guy? I don't know. I don't know how I feel. I've made up my mind. I'm not going to see this one, either. I want to remain honest to my own feelings, like Haruka did. You don't say. That's probably best. The festival... Yeah. Are you all right? Weren't you and Haruka-? Can't be helped. I'll apologize to her later. There they are! Shin Takayuki, why you-! What were you doing, saying you'd be going together with Suzumiya to the festival, then standing her up!? She was worried to tears that you weren't coming! It's okay, Taira-kun. It's nothing, really. I'm sorry, Haruka. I didn't know you were expecting him. I brought him here because I wanted someone to talk to. Lately, I've had some things on my mind, so... Mitsuki... So that's why. I know it was wrong to do that to you, Haruka, but I just couldn't leave Hayase all alone. I'm really sorry. Mm-mm, it's okay, if that's the case. After all, Mitsuki, you are my dear friend. Friend? Thanks. Still... ...we all wound up getting together here, and all. That's what friends... that's what pals do. Haruka... A- all right, well, as long as we're all here, let's all go to the festival together. In that case, to make it up to everyone, it's my treat! Terrific! But before we go, let's get a picture together. Come to think of it, this will be the first time the four of us have taken a picture, huh? There, you see? So this will be commemorative. "Come in a little closer. --Like this? Haruka! Sorry about what happened today. Mm-mm. Mitsuki was concerned about something, right? I think I would have done the same thing. Oh, yeah? So I'm glad that you took such good care of Mitsuki, Takayuki-kun. Huh? Ah, my parents went out. Akane went with them. She did, huh? Say, want to come on in for a bit? I still want to talk some. 5- sure... So Haruka, this is your room? You're embarrassing me. Don't stare at it like that. You've got a lot of picture books. I like them. Now that you mention it, are you still missing that one picture book from before- "Mayauru's Gift"? Okay then, let's both go looking for it sometime. It's my future dream to become a picture book author, so when I get into college, I'd like to major in child psychology. You're amazing, Haruka. I'm sure you'll become one. When you do, write a story about the four of us friends. That would be nice. Haruka... I'm going on inside. Huh? Sis, are you home? I'm home! Akane! Welcome home. You were out late, huh? Big Brother, by any chance did you eat my sister? A- Akane! How could you say that!? Something's up! Mame-Chan, are you trying to get in the way, or root us on? Which one is it? Both! Sorry about today. Haruka... There's no reason to rush. We'll have plenty of time, after all. Say, Takayuki-kun, can we do the ritual? Like this? Mm-hmm, and then you repeat the words that I say. Like the stars that twinkle in the night sky... Like the stars that twinkle in the night sky... ...hearts that have melted together will never come apart. ...hearts that have melted together will never come apart. Even though these hands let go... Even though these hands let go... ...as long as neither of us forget... "flu-IOU- "Picture book corner" mm Yeah, I'm going to test for Hakuryo U. Test? You mean-? You sure are laid back. Was it Suzumiya? Yeah, I guess. Yikes, I'm going to be late! Haruka is going to be upset. But then... she'" probably forgive me when she sees this. Takayuki? What are you up to around here? Hayase. What's with that outfit? Got a date? No, silly, I was just visiting the trade team. Heh, is that it? Is that what? What about you? Date with Haruka? Yeah, she's waiting for me in front of Hiiragicho Station. Hmm, you guys are getting along well. You make me jealous. You bet, you bet. So, that being the case, I'll see you later. Takayuki, guess what! As it happens, today is my birthday... you see... Ah, I like this one. Huh? A ring? No good? You want a ring from me, as a birthday present-? You're right. Sorry. Well then... .let's see.. This one, please. Are you sure? But... You wouldn't be happy getting something you didn't want, right? This will set me back a lot. Takayuki, thanks. I'll treasure it forever. Yeah, and in exchange, you can get me something ten times better on my birthday. Whoa, yikes! Look at the time! See you later. An accident, huh? Watch out for those. Where's Haruka-? I wonder if she got mad and left. It was a girl, right? That's a bad way to go. Yeah. "That girl is going to be okay, right? --She got run into by a car, didn't she? I wonder if she was waiting for someone. Poor girl. Haruka? Haruka- Haruka! Haruka! Excuse me. Haruka! Where are you! Haruka! Reporting an accident, today at 14:15. Identification was made by means of a student picture I.D. found at the scene. The victim went to Hakuryo U Annex High, Hiiragi Campus, a senior, name of. ...Suzumiya... ...Haruka. "Mayauru's Gift" Embraced by a gentle breeze, my heart breaks as I think of you. All alone at the top of the hill, I watch as the seasons go by. I wonder, what is there to see beyond those blue skies? Wishing for courage, softly, I pray. There's no going back now to those tender days when you held me in your arms. Memories of that summer still faintly linger. Those small fireworks remain, even now.
