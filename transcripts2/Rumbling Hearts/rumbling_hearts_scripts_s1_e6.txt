 "Episode 6" You're kidding! Really? What's worse, we were at a meet. All of the swimmers were doing their best, and the coach was there snoring up a storm! Unbelievable! Isn't it? Hello, Mitsuki-sempai. Akane! Geez, Akane, don't startle me like that. Hey, Sempai, listen, listen! I've changed the way I lift my arms. Huh? Your arms? I watched the video of last week's meet, and studied it. Video? Yes. The way your arms glide over the water's surface, that's what I mean.

 Your form is awfully graceful, and I branded every last bit of it onto the backs of my eyes. Whoa, Akane, where did you see such a video? Oh, I asked my sister to record it- I told you not to say anything! Oh, sorry. You, Haruka? I asked you to stop doing that because it embarrassed me. Uh-huh, but Akane said she wanted to see it so badly, so I asked Coach Takanashi if I could. Sorry. Geez! You're dead to me, Haruka! I said I was sorry Huh? Sempai? Sis? Um... um... I didn't know it would lead to a fight... I... Akane, you were really panicked! There's no way we could get into a fight, you know! Geez! That does it! You idiots! Be careful going home' Hayase-san! What are you doing? Let's go! Sorry! This is such nice weather... Akane? W- what, sis? Do you think Takayuki-kun will be coming today? I miss him. You shouldn't say that, Sis. Big Brother is busy studying for his entrance exams. I know. I should be studying for exams, too, after all. Oh, whoops! I haven't changed the water in your vase today, have I? I'll be right back. "Visitors, please obtain permission from the doctor in charge, Kozuki Motoko (ext. 52)." Are you still going to go visit her? Yeah. I see. I have an obligation, after all. Once Haruka gets better... Once she does, you're going to tell her about us, right? Yeah, I'll tell her. Listen, Takayuki... You're okay, right? I went to the area around Hakuryo on business today. I took a little peek, and a lot had changed. The school seemed unfamiliar, for some reason. A lot has happened, and a lot has changed. I just haven't been able to accept any of it. That goes for me, too. Takayuki, you're all I've got. You're all I have, Takayuki. Everything's all right. Takayuki... It's all right. I love you, Takayuki. Ehh. It's like we're slopping animals. I'll pretend I didn't see this. Since when was I in charge of raising dogs? I can't handle this. Hey! Let go of me! Where are you going? Wherever my legs carry me! Wherever I feel like! I don't care where you go, just do it after you've cleaned up table #3. You do it! Fine. Come with me. W- wha're you doing!? sto' it! What do you mean, "you do it"?! You haven't cleaned up a single table today, have you!? Let '2 go'.! Take care of #3. As if, bonehead! You're at it again? You never get tired of it, huh? Yeah, well, it's like it's one of my daily chores. Shaddu' Narumi-kun... Oh, Manager. Is this a good time? Oh, sure. What is it? "Actually, Narumi-kun, I need a brief word with you- --You numbskull! You pull on them too hard! Oh, I asked Tamano-san to bus the tables. Daikuji-san, excuse me, but would you please go help her out? #3, if you please. Uh, right. #3, if you please. You can go step in cat crap! As if, bonehead. Oh, Manager, what did you want to speak to me about? Right. As it happens, we're suddenly short for the night shift. If I could, I'd like to ask you to work it. Tonight? How would that be? I'm sorry, but tonight's not good for me. Making out again? He's making out, he's making out. What, really? Hey, make-out king! Do a little work sometime' That goes double for you, too! Sheesh. Narumi-kun... How about working here full-time? You're the only one who can do anything about that loudmouth, after all. Oh, Narumi-kun, hello. Hello. Well, I'll come again tomorrow. Okay. You never learn, huh? Something the matter? No, nothing. How is Haruka doing? Mm, a bit more settled down. Her memory? It looks like it will still take a little while longer. But she does seem to remember you coming here. She did? Haruka? Takayuki-kun! I've come back. How are you feeling? It seems like one day goes by so fast. Here I think it's morning, and suddenly, it becomes evening. Once it becomes evening, then it's morning again. It's kind of... it's kind of scary. You're so warm. It's reassuring. Haruka, listen... Say, let's do the ritual. The ritual. Like the stars that twinkle in the night sky, hearts that have melted together will never come apart. Even though these hands let go... Haruka, let's do it after you've gotten better. It seems like one day goes by so fast. "Yokohama South Bus" "Keyaki General Hospital" Thank you, Narumi-kun. I didn't think you would ever come here again. Thank you so much. If you would, please come see Haruka again. Haruka always talks about you, Narumi-san, over and over again. She will recover from the disorder of her memories in time, but in order for that to happen... I know I'm in no position to ask this of you, after I told you not to come anymore, But what Haruka needs right now is you. For Haruka's sake, please come see her. We don't mind, as often as you can. I beg you. PM come every day, without fail. After all, Haruka was... Haruka was the most important person in the world to me. "Was," huh? Welcome home. I'm back. Thanks for dinner. That was delicious. Oh, uh-huh. I'm glad. I'll go make some tea, okay? Yeah. Say, how was Haruka? O- oh, she's doing fine. Did she know this was the second time you'd visited her, Takayuki? Yeah, she remembered. She did? That's good. What about me? Yeah, of course she remembered you. she asked me why you didn't come today. I see. Here you go. Thank you. Shouldn't you be getting home soon? You've got an early morning tomorrow, right? I'll see you off. I'll spend the night. Is that okay? It's fine by me. Great. "Hakuryo University" --How about that assignment? --I didn't get it at all. Me neither. Takayuki? On, Shinji! Sorry to make you come here, but I'm pretty packed with lectures today. Nah, I'm the one who called you, after all. When do you work today? --I've got it off. "Oh, okay. Ah, Miki-chan! Hey'. Are you going to Philosophy 4th period? Uh-huh, probably. Okay, see you later. Wow, she's cute. Oh, by any chance, is that the girl you mentioned the other day? That's her! The one you stood up on that date? Yeah... You still have a pulse? Of course I do! At least, I'd like to think so... Hang in there. You like her, right? Is that right? Suzumiya is in that kind of shape, huh? Yeah. And even so, you're going to keep visiting her? I have an obligation to. Is it really just out of obligation? Or do you still have a thing for Suzumiya? No, I don't Can you say that for sure? Yeah. Fine, then. Don't you betray Hayase, though. She's actually incredibly fragile, after all. I know. I know things must be pretty tough right now, but make sure you smile in front of Hayase. Yeah. Hang in there. You like her, right? Yeah, I do. Hazawa Trading. Yes, that's me. Thank you for your constant patronage. Yes, the merchandise will definitely be ready at the beginning of the week. Yes, I would appreciate that. What are you doing, standing there? Akane... My sister is asleep right now. I see I didn't think you were this dull-witted, after everything I already said to you. I wanted to talk to you, too. About what? About you and Narumi-san? I don't even want to hear about it. You don't have to understand me. I just wanted to get this off my chest. You astound me. You're just trying to put yourself at ease. You're just trying to say your piece and unburden yourself, so you can forget all about your own suffering! Just how self-centered are you!? I- it's not like that. I wouldn't- Please leave! You have to suffer more! I won't let you have your comfort! Please leave' Akane-chan... What are you doing out here? Is something wrong? Not really. Aren't you dedicated, coming every day? And you don't even have any feelings for her. Narumi-san... Ah, Takayuki-kun! Oh, hello there. Hi, Boyfriend. O- oh, excuse me. I'll be outside until you're done. Oh, no, we're already done. Nice timing. She is doing very well today. Aren't you? Yes. Okay, then... Sorry to bother you. Okay, you can take it from here. Takayuki-kun... Come over here. You're just trying to forget all about your own suffering! Huh? I never did that! You liar. I heard about it from Hayase. You wore cute little boots on your physical fitness test. Mitsuki is just awful. she promised me she wouldn't tell you. So you did the 50m run? In boots? Well, it was raining that morning. Why didn't you bring any shoes to change into? I didn't realize it until later. Geez, don't talk about it so much. It's embarrassing. That story is pretty famous. But I never imagined that it was you, Haruka. Takayuki-kun, you're laughing too much. Sorry, sorry. Still... Still, I'm glad. I love it when you smile, Takayuki-kun. Haruka... Say, how are your entrance exam studies going? Are they progressing? Oh, yeah. I'm managing something or other. Really? I'd like to get back to studying soon, too. I'm starting to get a little uneasy about them. It's all right. Whatever you do, don't rush it. Everything else comes after you recover, right? Mm-hmm, I know. I'm so glad you're here for me, Takayuki-kun. Say, do you remember our ritual? Huh? Yeah... Shall we do it? Did you forget? No.. You don't like the ritual? Sure. Let's do the ritual. Like the stars that twinkle in the night sky, hearts that have melted together will never come apart. Even though these hands let go, as long as neither of us forget. "I have an early morning tomorrow, so I've gone home for the day. -Mitsuki" It's all right... Down the road we would always walk home on, hand in hand, I won't let go. I wish we could stay this way, but time keeps passing us by. ! only draw one dream in the night sky- I want to be your star, someday. The midsummer constellations shine down on us as the two of us quietly pray that we can stay together like this, staying true to our feelings. The light has just been born within our two hearts. Like the stars that twinkle in the night sky... Like the stars that twinkle in the night sky... ...hearts that have melted together will never come apart. Even though these hands let go... ...as long as neither of us forget. Like the stars that twinkle... ...in the night sky... "To be continued"
