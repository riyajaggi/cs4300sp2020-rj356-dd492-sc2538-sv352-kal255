 Well, I'm off. I can't come over tonight. Okay. Mitsuki, about living together- what do you want to do? Mm? Let's not. Let's not? You're the one who proposed it. Are you sure? Mm-hmm, I'm sure. I must have gotten carried away. It's not like we're getting married. Mitsuki... Bye. "Episode 4" A cherry blossom? I'm going to the hospital now. I have to hurry, or I won't make visiting hours, so if you'll excuse me... Sis, look, cherry blossoms.

 From the hill in front of the school. That must bring back memories, huh? If you don't wake up soon, I'm going to overtake you, Sis. You really do take your time with everything. Huh? It was clear a moment ago. Let's see... just a moment, okay? Um... Oh, this looks delicious, too. What should I get? Working hard? Ishida-san? That was quick. I was just picking up some papers. That doesn't take much time. What are these copies? Oh, I told you we didn't need these copied, didn't I? Y- you did? You've been making a lot of mistakes lately, huh? Has something happened? You can talk to me about it. No, I wouldn't say that, exactly. I just haven't been paying attention. I'll be more careful. Seafood casserole and Japanese-seasoned hamburger set, and please make it quick. Coming up! Yes, Hazawa Trading. Hmm? Yes, one moment, please. For me? It's Narumi-san. So he is your boyfriend. If he's calling you at work, then you two must be stretched fairly thin. Y- yeah. Act like you're talking to one of our regular customers, so those around us don't find out. Hello, how can I help you? Yeah, it's me. Sorry for calling you at work. I tried your cell, but it didn't go through. Listen, do you have anything to do after you get off work? Why? I'll give you the details when I see you. 6 o'clock, at Hiiragicho. Yeah... Bye. Hey! Sempai, we caught him in the act of flirting! Well done, Mayu-Mayu. H- how long have you been there? Right! Ever since "Yeah, it's me." Right in the middle of the day, too. What do you think you're doing, using the company phone for this? Oh, what is going on? Oh, you're just in time. Yes? As it happens... Daikuji was using the company telephone for her personal use. I what!? Oh, that is not very good, is it? T- that's not true! The one who was using it was- H- her! No it wasn't! Stop horsing around! You could have just said something to me, but if you're going to lie about it... I- I told you, I didn't do it! Well, Manager, Tamano-san and I will be out on the floor. Come on! If you please. Hey, wait! So, was the phone call local? Look, I told you... That does it! You can just go step in cat crap” What's come up so suddenly? Oh, you'll see. How about we start looking around here? "Ishida Real Estate" With our salaries, we'd probably be around here... A southern exposure would be nice, huh? But those are expensive... Okay, Sis, I'll be going home now. I don't think this is wrong. It's not as though we're trying to forget about Haruka. It's just that right now, we have our own lives to live. Isn't that right? Mine, and yours... These aren't doing it for me. Let's go. Hey... Mitsuki... Takayuki... Takayuki... "Real estate browsing with Mitsuki 4" Oh, yeah? You really did it, huh? Congratulations. Thank you very much. But they're still the preliminaries, so I have to stay on guard. You're confidence and strength are something else. Don't you ever get tired? If you don't let up on yourself once in a while, you'll ruin yourself. I'm all right! Okay, I guess it's none of my business. Oh, no, it's not like that. So, how did her periodical exam go? Nothing unusual. Her body is the picture of health. Enough so that I wish we could start her on a rehabilitation program right away. But that's only if she'll wake up for us. Dr. Kozuki! Here she is! Is something the matter? Well... Sakada-san in 103 had some alcohol brought in to him. Again? And after everything I said to him, too. Well, I'll see you later, okay? Okay. Earlier, he had a turtle brought in, and he was feeding it. A turtle? Where was he keeping something like that? In his bed. "Suzumiya Haruka" I have an important announcement! Today, I won the district preliminaries! Isn't that amazing? I was absolutely, completely- Why would-? D- Doctor! Dr. Kozuki, my sister-! My sister- Doctor! "Narumi Takayuki" "Aozora Shopping Center" "Aozora Shopping Center" All right then, if you'd be so kind... All right then, if you'd be so kind... Okay, we will come by again later. Sure. Let's see, next up... So, you say you still haven't settled on finding a place? Yes, I did. We just can't seem to find a good one. At this rate, you're going to break up before you decide on one, aren't you? Maybe 50, huh? Say, would you join me tonight? I found a nice wine shop. Oh, I'm sorry, tonight... You're so single-minded. That's too bad. Sorry. Here you go. Tonight's curry might be a little spicy. Hey! Starting today, you get the octopus. Huh? How come? Because you get angry easily and turn red, that's why. What did you say!? There, you see? Forgive me! Don't hit me! Geez, fine! Okay, I'll let you borrow the dolphin for a little while. Come on, the food is getting cold. Eat up, eat up. --Yeah. --"I humbly accept this meal." "I humbly accept this meal." Whoa, this is spicy! I told you. During the summer, spicy is better. Even so... Are you sure? It's probably just my job. If I answer, they'll give me more work. Hello, this is Narumi. I'm not in at the moment. --If you need to reach me, please leave a message after the beep. --This really is spicy! A silent phone call? Ah, I got it! It's Daiku" she got forced to work the night shift, so she's taking it out on me. --For crying out- --This is Suzumiya... I'm calling because there's something that I have to inform you about. Actually, I probably should have told you about this earlier... .but, um... my sister... my sister is awake. She wants to see you, Narumi-san, very much. That's all. Wait! Akane-chan! Akane? I'm leaving for today. Are you staying the night, Mom? Mm-hmm. We can't let her be all alone when she wakes up, right? Right. Mom, I called Narumi-san's place a little while ago. I'm not going to the hospital. I can't go. Why not? She's our friend, right? If you don't see Haruka now, Takayuki, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. I don't want you going back to the way you were then, Takayuki. Let's go together. Tomorrow. It's all right. I haven't seen you in a while. I'm glad to see you two are both looking well. Dr. Kozuki.. Um. Hayase-san, was it? Yes. Nice to see you again. You cut your hair, huh? Um, was there something-? Mm-mm. Shall we get going? "Special ward" Narumi-kun, what are you doing these days? Working at a family restaurant. So you gave up on your entrance exams. Yes... It's been about one month since she woke up. Her physical recovery is progressing extremely well. I'm going to let you see her now, but there is one thing that you must observe. What is that? The passage of time. Please do not tell her that three years have gone by since the accident. Why not? Time for her has stood still since then. Stood still? If you please. Big Broth- Suzumiya-san, Narumi-kun is here. Takayuki-kun! Haruka... You came. I'm so happy. Y- yeah... What's the matter, Takayuki-kun? I'm sorry'. Mm-mm, I'm the one who should be apologizing. I'm sorry I worried you so much. Takayuki-kun... What's the matter? You're making an alarming face. Haruka! Takayuki-kun... Don't cry, Takayuki-kun. You're going to make me cry, too. Haruka... Mitsuki, you're here. Thank goodness you're getting better. Thank you. But the picture book artist exhibit is over. I wonder if they'll hold it again somewhere. Still, once second semester starts, we'll be busy studying for entrance exams. I was going to go see it with you, Takayuki-kun. That's a real shame. T- that's okay, sis! I'm sure they'll hold a picture book artist exhibition again sometime. You can always go with Big Brother to that one once they do, right? You can't always study all the time; you have to take a breather once in a while, too. Right, Big Brother? But... Yeah, Haruka, Akane is right. If you don't get well soon, you won't be able to do anything, will you? Huh? Mitsuki, you're here. Thank you, Mitsuki. Excuse me a moment. Suzumiya-san, let me check your temperature. You are a bit warm. Looks like you're tired. I'm sorry, but can we call it a day? Let's have you lie down for a bit. I'll lower the bed. There, slowly, slowly... Takayuki... Can I have a moment? Narumi-san, why did you come with her!? Why would you bring her to my sister's room!? Akane... Why did you come? Are you here to show my sister how well you two are getting along? You've got a lot of nerve showing your face in front of my sister! And with these! Akane-chan'.! It's okay, Takayuki. But... No, it's all right. You sure are close. I can see how you two have been enjoying the love you have together, while leaving my sister alone for these three years! Akane, listen... Please stop calling me that! My poor sister, betrayed by her very best friend! Aren't you ashamed!? Don't you even feel guilty!? I- I... Narumi-san, my sister needs you now. she wants you by her side. And yet you... You're a coward! Down the road we would always walk home on, hand in hand, I won't let go. I wish we could stay this way, but time keeps passing us by. ! only draw one dream in the night sky- I want to be your star, someday. The midsummer constellations shine down on us as the two of us quietly pray that we can stay together like this, staying true to our feelings. The light has just been born within our two hearts. Are we really going to do this, Sempai? Of course we are. How can she be a heroine if all she does is sleep? There are limits to how pampered one should be. Here goes... R- right! Ready, set... Dash! Right! Yo!
