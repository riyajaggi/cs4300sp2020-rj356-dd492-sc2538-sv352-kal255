 "Episode 3" "Episode 3" I told you, this isn't right. Huh? I ordered the strawberry parfait, not the onion gratin soup. You did take down my order, right? Where do you keep your ears? I mean, how could you mistake this for that? You're copping a bad attitude, here, huh? You made the mistake, now apologize. Don't you "huh" me! Apologize! Hey, I told you to apologize! T- this is bad. Manager? Yes, it is. Where are you going?! I'm going to go call for help. Hurry, before there's violence.

 Come on in! Um... Will it be just yourself? Is "huh" all you can say!? Stop looking down on your customers, already! You bastard! I'm not a bastard. Why, you-! Hey, that was going too far. Doesn't matter when they're this dumb. Come on, hurry back with my strawberry parfait. Will that be all- Now, look here! Whaddya think you're doing, you moronsl? Don't go screaming bloody murder just because your order is wrong, you son of a bitch! What did you say!? Shut up'. What are two guys ordering sweets for, anyhow?! That's gross! What's more, you use it as a pretext to get your jollies with the waitress. You're worse than dogs! You're worse than worms! Look, you, what pretext!? Any way you look at it, this was your fault! Oh? Looks like you want to crawl around on the ground, like the worms that you are- Daikuji, are you at it again? What are you doing, you dung beetle!? We are terribly sorry for this. We will bring you your order right away. Don't butt in, you dung beetle! Yeah, I know, I know. We're sorry, really. You should fire that chick right away! Why, you-! Don't get so cocky! What are you doing!? Get in there right now, you little... For crying out loud, on what planet does someone mistake onion gratin soup for a strawberry parfait!? Shaddu'! Why, you... Le' go o' me, you dung 'eetle! Dung beetle? Narumi-kun, thanks for everything. Ah, Manager. Best of all, the customers were unharmed. It was a close one, though. That's Takayuki-san for you! Well, I'm sort of used to that kind of thing. Don't get so carried away! How dare you do this to my cheeks!? I'll be out on the floor. Thanks. Don't you ignore me! Hey, wait! Don't make a scene on the floor, dummy. That's got nothing to do with it! I'm not through talking to you, you moron! You make a full apology to me! There's no way in hell I'm going to do that. All right, I've had it with you! Go step in cat crap You have no idea what kind of establishment this is, do you? What was that!? Enough already. Go wash some dishes in the kitchen or something and cool off. Please excuse the commotion. Mitsuki? That woman waved at you. So what? What does that mean, Takayuki-san? If you wouldn't mind, we'd certainly like to hear about it. Not you too, Manager. So, what is that woman to you? What is she? Never mind about that. Come on, get working, get working. Don't push, you dung beetle! Cut it out! Come on! What's wrong? It's been so long, yet you haven't said a thing. Did something happen? Today was the first time l ever went to your work, Takayuki. It looks like you have fun there. Huh? Where do you see that? It really does look like you have fun there. Welcome! How many? Three of us. There's one more coming later. Yo, Takayuki! Hayase! Over here! He's already here. Sorry, I started without you. That's okay. It's been a long time since all three of us have gotten together. Shinji, you said you were going to be late. Yeah, well, my date suddenly cancelled on me. What a drag. She suddenly cancelled? Your girlfriend? It was heading in that direction anyhow. But it's been like this with us since we started. Maybe I'm just beyond hope. Cheers! Cheers! cheers! Excuse me a minute. Oh, it's you, Tom. Hello. Yeah, how did it go? Eight sophomores in all, huh? Well then, keep it down to 20 seats, okay? Okay, thanks. Sorry about that. A party or something? Farewell party for the circle's seniors. They put me in charge of it. Can you handle it? Hey, now, give me some credit. The underclassmen have put a lot of trust in me. You sure have come into your own. How's your part-time job? Same as always? All of the waitresses there are cute. You must be in heaven. I only wish. You can't fool me. What do you mean by that? What about you, Hayase? You've been with the company for three years. There must be someone who came in after you by now. We're a small firm, and didn't hire anyone this year. We're Shorthanded, so when the work gets around to me, there's lots of it. So, you work overtime every day? Luckily enough. I almost had some today, but I was working outside the office, and got to go straight home. If I'd gone back, I wouldn't have been able to come here tonight. Is that right? Well, you two are both so busy, you probably don't get to visit each other much, do you? Well... you know. Okay then, I'll be in touch. --Yeah. --See you later. This late already? What do you want to do, Mitsuki? You've got an early morning, right? Mm-hmm, but I'd like to stay with you a little longer today, Takayuki. Is that okay? No? Shower... No need. But... Takayuki... Say... There's an aquarium in Keyakicho, right? Yeah. They just got some sea otters in there. Let's go see them sometime. Sometime when? Sunday, maybe. Sunday, huh? They asked me to help out at work then. Oh. If it were the week after next... what are you doing? Listen, how about we live together? If we did, we'd always be able to be together, wouldn't we? That's true... We'd move into some place a little bigger than this- the two of us. Don't go talking crazy all of a sudden. How much do you think that would cost? Yeah... You're right. Sorry about asking the impossible. Mitsuki-sempai, hang in there! Mitsuki, hang in there! First place in Course 3, Hayase Mitsuki! Wow, what a nice day. Well, I'll be going, then. It's a nice day, so air out your futon before you go to work, okay? Mm-hmm. Come back soon. I'm off. Mitsuki... What? Want to move in? You said so last night, remember? It must be a pain to commute and all, so... Move in? You mean, here? Yeah. Would you rather not? Well... Sorry, no time right now, I have to go, okay? This is just like it was three years ago, Takayuki. Incoming train on track 2. Please wait behind the white line. "Hazawa Trading" "Hazawa Trading" Hayase-san, are you ready to go out making today's rounds? Hayase-san, are you ready to go out making today's rounds? Yes. There are quite a lot of samples, but you'll be okay, right? You're still young. Yes. Huh? You stayed over at your boyfriend's last night, didn't you? At least leave a change of clothes there. This is unbecoming. This is a business, and we meet all sorts of people. You have to be careful about your appearance. Sorry about that, lshida-san. Well, I used to do it a lot once upon a time, myself. Whoa, looky there, this is a surprise. Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's my Sempai. Nice going. It took me three whole years to get it. Amazing! You're a model for the Japanese people! You're giving me too much praise, Mayu-Mayu. What are you two up to, slacking off back here? You're just in time. Feast your eyes on this! What are you, stupid? What do you mean? You got a problem with this? It's a Gold Card! Didn't you say you've never even driven a car since you got your license? That's right. So what? It doesn't change the fact that I'm accident- and ticket-free. You know, if you're not driving around every day, that's not exactly a big deal or anything. What was that? Tamano-san, if you got your license and then just left it alone, you could get the same thing. Oh, you mean it? Hey! Stop making fun of me! I'm simply telling her the truth. Like he said. You too, Mayu-Mayu? However, Mayu has not gotten her license. Huh? Why not? I'm scared of getting into an accident. Yes, accidents are scary. You're absolutely right, Mayu-Mayu. That's why I don't drive, either. You got that, you wimp? Huh? What? I wasn't listening. Excuse me, could someone get out on the floor? Yes, going now. Hey, you! I'm not done talking to you! Now, now . Very well then, if you'd be so kind... Let's see, next up... Two more stops, huh? We'll have to hurry. Okay. That took a lot of time. The manager there likes to talk for a while. Why can't he be more considerate toward us? Too heavy? Uh, no, I'm just out of shape. Oh? Do you find making rounds arduous? I wouldn't say that. Really? In a hurry to get home? No, it's not like that... Are you just making time until Mr. Right comes along? Well, it doesn't matter. It's not like this job is especially worth doing. Tell me, are you getting along well with your boyfriend? Eh? Uh... Sorry, it's really none of my business, huh? N- no, it's not that. We're doing fine. "Dolphin Swimming" Mitsuki! Hang in there! What's the matter? You're zoning out. What's the matter? I'm sorry. It's nothing at all. Ow... Hayase-san! Are you okay? Yes. 5- sorry about that. Takayuki I'm sorry. Listen, can I see you today? Mitsuki? What's wrong? Aren't you eating? It'll get soggy. Say... Let's set things straight between us. I don't think it's going to work like this. I do like you, Takayuki, and I always want to be with you. What about you, Takayuki? How do you feel about me? I like you, too. Really? Yeah. Thanks. That's what I wanted to hear. We can move in together, right? Yeah, if that's what you want. When is good? There's no rush. Let's think this through. This is something important, after all. This is about our... ...future together, after all. You're right. Shall we go? You're so warm' Takayuki, you're sure it's all right for me to be with you, right? Of course it is. Yeah, you're right. Are you coming over tonight? Uh-uh, I didn't bring a change of clothes. My sempai got mad at me about that today. I can walk with you like this as far as the station, right? Yeah. The swim club? They're underclassmen. Let's go. Thanks for treating us today. Thanks for treating us, Suzumiya-sempai. Don't mention it. If this will get my dear underclassmen fired up, it's a small price to pay. Or so I wish. This was a bit much, so whoever has the slowest time tomorrow is buying. Then, that will be me! Hang in there. I have high hopes. Okay, that's all for today. Everyone be careful going home, now. Right! Thank you very much! Excuse us! There's still time. Akane... Akane, it's been so long... Narumi-san, I haven't seen you around. Y- yeah... I'm going to the hospital now. I have to hurry, or I won't make visiting hours, so if you'll excuse me... Down the road we would always walk home on, hand in hand, I won't let go. I wish we could stay this way, but time keeps passing us by. ! only draw one dream in the night sky- I want to be your star, someday. The midsummer constellations shine down on us as the two of us quietly pray that we can stay together like this, staying true to our feelings. The light has just been born within our two hearts. At last, our turn has come, right Mayu-Mayu? Yes, Sempai! Are you okay, Sempai? This is nothing. Dying here wouldn't gain me anything! That's the Sempai I know! --I am dying! --Sempai! I'm all right. Now, let's show them how awesome we are! Right! Okay, first off- Hey! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
