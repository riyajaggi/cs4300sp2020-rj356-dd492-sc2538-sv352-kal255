 Takayuki-kun... You don't like the ritual? "I have an early morning tomorrow, so I've gone home for the day. -Mitsuki" It's all right... "Episode 7" Hello? Mitsuki, are you working? I'm on my lunch break. What's up? Oh, I just wanted to apologize for being so late yesterday. Huh? Oh... The food was delicious. Is that all? Is that all you wanted to say? Y- yeah, that's all. should I not have called?

 Uh-uh. If that's all, okay. Want to go have a drink or something later today? Oh, sorry. I've got a business get-together today. Oh, you do? Don't drink too much, now. You can't hold your liquor, after all. Well, I'll let you go. Sorry to call you without any warning. Mm-mm, I'm glad you did. Thanks. Everything's fine. Okay, hang in there at work. I have a responsibility for my feelings toward Haruka, but you are my girlfriend, Mitsuki. Sempai, was he flirting? No doubt about it. Here we are during our lunch rush, and he's goofing off back there. Now we're going to have to lay some divine retribution on him. Ooh, divine retribution? We'll strip him naked, and parade him around town! We'll make it so he can't live in this city! Oh ho, that does sound like fun. M- Manager! So, which one of you is going to be paraded around town, then? Mayu-Mayu! Yes, Sempai? We have work waiting for us. Let's go! Right! What's going on? A parade, apparently. Sorry about that. That was a long call, huh? I've started eating without you. Sorry. You really are a klutz, you know. Trying your hardest to be stoic may be fine when you're a student, but when you get out into the world, it works against you. Don't think so overly seriously about things. Or things that would otherwise go well for you won't go so well. What do you mean by that? Do I really look that unhappy? Do I look that miserable? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Mm-mm, I'm finally starting to see a little humanity in you. Let's have a fun time tonight. Ah, Narumi-san! Good evening. You're late this evening. Visiting hours are already over. Mm-hmm, my work dragged on late. ls Akane-chan here? She went home a little while ago. She did, huh? Say, Boyfriend... Did you do anything to Suzumiya-san yesterday? W- whoa, Fumio-chi... Amakawa, not like that. Did you make her any promises or anything? Promises? A- ah, is that what you meant? I wouldn't call it a promise, but there is a little ritual that we did. Is there something wrong? A ritual? Like saying "chichin puipui" to make her all better? Oh, no. It's a little bit different, but yeah, something like that. Did Haruka say something? She didn't say what it entailed, but she was really happy when she talked about it. Then she remembered. Yes, she did. Lately, Suzumiya-san has been hastily regaining her perceptions. Hold on, doesn't "hastily" sound a little weird, Amakawa? Huh? It does? Then, "expeditiously"? That's even stranger. Then, "ably"? "Vigorously"? --"Vigorously"? --U- um... You mean, for Haruka, things are moving in the right direction, right? Yes, of course. It could all be thanks to you, Boyfriend. Oh, nah... Oh, Narumi-kun... Doctor... You're late, huh? Um, could I go see her now? Yes, I don't mind. she can hardly wait. Okay. Yo! Takayuki-kun! I know I'm late. Sorry. Uh-uh, it's fine. At least you're here. I'm so glad. Everything's fine. Is something wrong? Do I have something stuck to my face? Oh, no. Sorry, I pulled an all-nighter last night, and now I'm spacing out. An all-nighter? You shouldn't. It's bad for your health. Yeah, my studying is starting to get a little more interesting. Still, you shouldn't. You still have time before the entrance exams. You're right. I'll be careful. You promise? Mm-hmm, I promise. Oh, you mean it? Thank you. Bored? No, it's not like that... Your face says "bored." Sorry. I think I'm starting to get tired of you always saying "Sorry." Thank you, you're much too kind! Okay! We're next over here! Hayase is going to sing! Orders from your superior. Come on. I- I can't sing! What am I going to do with you? Okay, I'll sing along with her! That should be okay, right? Sing your heart out, and work the gloom out of your system. Okay? Right. All right, does anyone have a request? Yes! This feels nice. What, you want to do the ritual again? I'm not sure I like the way you said that. Sorry, sorry. Okay then, the ritual. Yeah. Whoa... I think we drank a little too much. Yes! Absolutely, Sempai! Feeling a little better? Yes! Thank you very much- Easy! Come on. Sorry. Are you sure you can walk? Yes! I'm fine' Everything's fine. Mm-hmm, I'm fine. I'm fine. Even though these hands let go, as long as neither of us forget. Takayuki-kun... Sorry, Sis, I forgot my bag- A- Akane... Akane-chan, we were just... Akane! Akane-chan! Wait up! Akane-chan... You're so cruel. You're not even putting your feelings into it. It's not like that. We were just... It's not like that? It's not like what!? How is it not like that!? Narumi-san, it's not my sister that you're in love with, is it!? I did tell you I wanted you to see her, but that was... ...that was... Please stop toying with my sister's feelings. It's not like that. It isn't like that. I... I.... You're here, huh? Mitsuki? Welcome home, Takayuki! Oh, you're drunk, are you? No, I'm not! What are you looking at? I've been going through them. We've been so busy, we forgot about this, didn't we? And it sounds like Haruka is starting to get better, so... ...I thought it was about time we settled on something. I found a nice one. It's a bit pricey, though. I think if we both split the cost, we should be able to somehow manage, though. It's close to the train station, and it's an end unit, like this one. Let's go see it this weekend. Oh, we should probably call the realtor first, huh? I don't want to wait until the weekend to decide, so I'm going to confirm it tomorrow. Say, which is better for you this weekend, Saturday or Sunday? Thanks. I've got them both off, so either one is okay with me. Oh, but I guess it's best to do it as soon as possible. Shall we make it Saturday? Or is Sunday better? We don't need to... yet... Move in together. We don't have to rush into it like this just yet, do we? Once Haruka settles down, we could... W- what are you saying? Takayuki, you're the one who said we should move in together, aren't you? You're the one who said we should live together, aren't you? I'm just saying, once Haruka- she doesn't have anything to do with it! Once Haruka settles down has got nothing to do with this! This matter is between us, isn't it!? What are you getting so angry about? You bet I'm angry! Of course I am! Calm down. I didn't say we weren't moving in together, did I? When are you going to tell her? About me and you, Takayuki. When are you going to tell Haruka? You aren't actually planning to tell her, are you!? W- what are you talking about? You're not going to tell her, are you? Are you!? Enough, already! You can't even hold your liquor, and yet you drink yourself to this point? Good grief... Hey! What are you doing!? That was dangerous, you know' So what!? So what? It's wrong for me to drink? 50 what if I get drunk? I'm hurting... I'm in pain... What's the matter? What happened? You still love her. Takayuki, you still love Haruka, don't you? Mitsuki... I can tell. I can tell you are. D- d- don't be ridiculous! I told you, that's not true. Everything's all right. You don't really mean that. I do mean it! No you don't! You don't really mean . Takayuki, you don't really love me' Mitsuki! Wait! Mitsuki! --Thank you very much. "Mama, that was yummy. That's nice. Takayuki-san doesn't seem very cheerful. Hmph, he must have messed up while making out, and now he's dejected over his own worthlessness. Oh, that is trouble. That's what you get, you wimp. Narumi-kun, just who I was looking for. Yes, what do you need? Let me introduce someone. This is Ito-san, from Sky Temple's main personnel office. It's nice to meet you. My name is Ito. Oh, hello. We were just talking about you. Narumi-kun, I hear you're not in school. On, that's right. Are there any reasons why not? No, not especially. Oh, sorry, sorry. That's a bad habit I have as a personnel man. Whenever I meet someone for the first time, I launch right in. Well, I have to run today, but I will drop by again sometime. If you'd be so kind. Narumi-kun, I'll see you later. 5- sure. Mmmm “mucky-n... What would someone from the personnel office he doing here? Oh, don't you get it yet? Word that we have a mangy cur here in the shop whose head is full of nothing but making out... ...has finally reached the main office. If left alone, he will reflect on the class of the restaurant, so he came to conduct an investigation. Oh! That's serious news! We have to fire this guy, or this restaurant will have no future. Oh! You mean, we'll be shut down!? Yep. Oh, that would be terrible. Come on, Manager, there's no way they'd do that. What's that? It sounds like a beaten... dog... If anyone is a classless problem child, it's her, right? What was that!? Is that right? 1- just a minute! Oh! This is a shocking new fact! Mayu-Mayu, not you, too! You know, if someone says to a customer, "How long are you going to rot there thinking about what to order!? "I'm busy here! Hurry it up, you dirty scumbag!!" where in those sentences is there any class? W- what? When did I ever say such a thing? She's said it, hasn't she, Tamano-san? Yes, about three times a week. There you have it, Manager. That is a problem, isn't it? Oh, she's broken. Are you okay? Why, you-! I'll knock you out flat! S- Sempai! We're in the temple! Lemme go! Lemme go, Mayu-Mayu! Well, Manager, I'm going back out on the floor. Yes, please do. Please wait' Bye. Hey, get back here! Get back here, you dung beetle! Sempai, class! You can just go step in cat crap! You've reached Hayase. I'm sorry, but I cannot come to the phone right now. I will return your call, so please leave your name. Huh? Haruka is asleep? Yes, soundly. She had a lot of tests done today. I'll bet she's exhausted. Is that so? And after you came all this way. I'm sorry about that. Nah. I'll come again tomorrow. Okay. We'll be waiting for you. Oh yeah, Boyfriend... Yes? Did you hear about her younger sister? Huh? Did something happen to Mane-Chan? We heard that she won again. She... won? Her swim meet. Her mother came in earlier, and spoke very happily about it. Oh yeah? That's amazing. It sure is. At this pace, she'll make the Olympics, no doubt about it. Amakawa-san admires her! That's because you're a lousy swimmer, huh Amakawa? Ah, hey, Fumio-chi, that's a secret! Is that right? she won, huh? Congratulations on winning. You're doing well, huh? Okay. Welcome home. Yeah. Sorry about yesterday. I've made up my mind. I'm going to live here with you. That's okay, right? Down the road we would always walk home on, hand in hand, I won't let go. I wish we could stay this way, but time keeps passing us by. ! only draw one dream in the night sky- I want to be your star, someday. The midsummer constellations shine down on us as the two of us quietly pray that we can stay together like this, staying true to our feelings. The light has just been born within our two hearts. "Life Advice Hotline" Yes? Um, it seems like my boyfriend is going back to his old girlfriend. What should I- You don't say. "Life Advice Hotline" Yes? Um, please listen to me. What should I do? How should I know, boneheadl? "Life Advice Hotline" What a pest! 15:11 it about time you got back to work? How should I know, boneheadl?
