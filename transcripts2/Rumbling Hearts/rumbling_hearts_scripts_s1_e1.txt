 There you are. --Hey. "Tag along with me. What for? So, Takayuki, are you seriously thinking of going to Koyo U? Yeah. Make it Hakuryo U, instead. What else are high school annexes for? Nah. With my grades, I couldn't get in on the escalator system. I don't want to bite off too much. You'll be sorry later on. No matter which college you go to, they're all the same. Hayase, rinse off and come on in.

 Mitsuki, here. Thank you. Every time I watch you, it's amazing. Huh? What is? 'Episode 1' At this pace, you're a shoe-in to make the trade team I hope so. Hey, Hayase! Told you so, Takayuki. Takayuki, shinji-kun, what's going on? Today is Sunday. Well, you know. You had practice again today? Of course. I've got that tournament, and all. You sure are working hard at it. I guess so.

 Goon... H- hello, Narumi-kun. H- hello. G- geez... What? It's not like he's going to take you and gobble you up. Oh, you came to get a reference book. It completely slipped my mind. So, what are you doing here, Takayuki? Oh, him? He's just a bonus. I'm tagging along because you asked me to tag along, remember? Oh, you're getting along as well as ever. Yep. Me and shinji love each other. Jealous? I- let go of me, Takayuki! Geez, don't be bashful. Don't say something so disgusting! You're giving me goose bumps! You don't mean that! shinji, you're so insensitive! Hey, keep away from me! You guys are being gross. Cut it out. Unless, Takayuki, you really mean it? What did you say? What about it? Did you know? Takayuki, the rest of the world refers to people like you as "idiots." Idiot? It must be hard on you, Shinji-kun, having to be around someone like this. What was that? Takayuki, cut it out, okay? Well, okay. I'd just get hurt if I tried facing up to Hayase. What did you say? --I'm not ready to die just yet, and all. "Listen, Mitsuki, I have to... Hold on a minute! What do you mean by that!? I mean this. Anyone who sees us can tell that you've got more muscle than I do. Lust look at those fine pects of yours- Yow! What was that for!? You know I'm self-conscious about that! Now say you're sorry! 3, 2, 1, go! What are you talking about!? You hit me! --I'm opposed to violence! "shut up! Huh? Where's Suzumiya? Huh? Looks like she left without us. Sheesh, this is all your fault! Hey, hold on a minute, now! Hold on, I said! Hey, Hayase! Come on! The hill? Mm-hmm, come by later. I need to talk to you. If you need to talk, do it right now. It's about something important. Something important? So make sure you come, okay? Sure... Hayase? Aren't you here yet? What could this "something important" he? She couldn't possibly mean to tell me that she... Suzumiya-san... H- hello. What are you doing here? Um... Mitsuki said... Oh, Suzumiya-san, she called you out here, too. I get it. Is this your first time coming here? Yes. It's nice here, huh? I knew... About this place- I knew that you liked it here, Narumi-kun. Even before we met each other at the bookstore, I've known about you, Narumi-kun. For a long time, now. Um... l like you! I like you. Would you please... go out with me? Narumi Takayuki? Who's that? Um, well, he's in your class, Mitsuki. Haruka, are you saying-? You are! You can't tell anyone about it! I won't tell. Oh, Haruka... Really, it's a secret. I get it. U- uh, Suzumiya-san, I... I'm sorry! I. Mm-hmm, sure. Sure. I'll go out with you. Thank goodness. I'm so glad. Uh-huh, I know. I am eating enough, you don't have to worry. Mom, sorry, I've got another call. Yes, I will call you back. Bye. Hello? Hey, it's me. Oh, Hayase'? Something up? Mm-mm, I was just wondering how it went. Oh. I'll bet you were a little surprised. Haruka is serious, though. Mm-hmm. 50? Did you say okay? Mm-hmm. You did? So you did say okay. So you did... Takayuki, Haruka is a dear friend of mine, you understand? If you break her heart, you'll answer to me. I know. Well, take good care of Haruka, okay? Yeah. The game center in front of the train station finally got it in! Right, right! I didn't know that. See you later. Hey, Takayuki, the game center in front of the train station got Valgern-on in! No way, really" I peeked inside yesterday, and there it was. Serious? "After we're done here today- --Hey, she's waiting. Suzumiya. You're going home together, right? Well, guess you're out of luck. Hurry up and go to her. Damn it, you make me sick! Definitely. Why would Suzumiya-san go for a guy like this? Take this! The loathing-of-the-unattached sleeper hold! "You're choking me! You're choking me! "Squeeze him tighter! --Drop him! So they have that game, do they? Mm-hmm. I haven't been to the game center in a while, so I didn't know. They got the jump on me. Suzumiya-san, do you play those games? No, I don't like games. Ah, I see. I'm sorry. Nah. So, do you have any hobbies, or anything? Nothing I would especially call a hobby. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Hayase! You're not concentrating enough! The tournament is nearly here. You don't have time to be slacking off. Right. The whole school is going to be counting on you. Don't forget that. Um... well, I'll be going now. Oh, okay. Well, see you tomorrow. "Lately, after looking at clouds every day like they were nothing, "I've once again started to pay attention when looking at them. --"I'll suddenly stop, and stare off into the sky. --From shinji. "And yet, it's strange how, "just by doing that, it feels like I've wandered into a different world. "For one thing, no two clouds ever look exactly the same. "Even when looking at the same cloud, "different people will see different things-" You think this will work? Sure it will. It's all clear on Suzumiya's side as well, right? Mm-hmm. She said tomorrow is Saturday, and she would be available. She did seem a little like she knew something was going on, though. It might be better to have her anticipating something, right? That's true. For heaven's sake, this couple needs a lot of work. It's been quite a while since they've started seeing each other, and still, all they ever do is go home from school together. And as for when they go out... That's just not right, huh? Take her out on a proper date, would you? Hey, let's go, too. Huh? Where? Come on, hurry! Hayase! When you said "let's go," you meant to follow them? I'm sorry about yesterday. It just happened so suddenly. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do. Listen, Suzumiya-san... Yes? Do you like movies? Yes, I do. Oh, yeah? What kind do you like? Or should I ask, which kind don't you like? I don't like horror films. I knew it. Even so, I've seen quite a bit of them. Why's that? My younger sister loves horror films. She'll rent a video, and say, "It's a comedy, let's watch it together." But when it starts, it will be a horror film. She has tricked me like that many times. I'll bet the one tomorrow will be one, too. Tomorrow? My sister invited me to go out and see a movie. It's absolutely not a horror film, or so she says. So I'm thinking of turning her down. You should go. You sister is looking forward to this, right? Besides, at a movie theater, you'll be able to tell if it's a horror film or not at the door. Oh, that's true... That idiot. Um, well, I'll be... Why, you-! For crying out loud! You guys? --What's the big ideal? "Huh? Don't "huh" us! Why didn't you invite her!? She said she'd be with her sister tomorrow. She said she was going to turn her down, didn't she? She was waiting for you to ask her, Takayuki! Takayuki, you are going out with Suzumiya, right? As her boyfriend, you have to try to make some time for the two of you to be together! Don't go out with her half-heartedly. Haruka is my friend, after all. You've got to treat Suzumiya better, or else it's cruel, you know? Takayuki, you agreed to go out with her because you like her, didn't you? You said okay to Haruka because you like her, don't you? You don't understand. You guys don't understand anything. We don't understand what? What is it we don't understand? That Suzumiya is your- Takayuki! Hey, wait up! Why, that... "Suzumiya" "Suzumiya" Hello? It's Suzumiya. Is this a good time? Uh, yeah. What's wrong? Um... Narumi-kun, Narumi-kun, do you like me? Answer me... please... I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm sorry. Are you looking for Haruka? She's already gone home. I wonder if something has happened between those two. Starting tomorrow will be your summer vacation, but please be careful not to spread your wings too much. To those seniors who are facing entrance exams or job placement, this summer vacation will be a challenge. The classrooms will be open throughout July, so please use them freely. This is an important time for you to decide which road is best for you to go down, and to do everything you need to do to secure your future. Good luck to you. I knew you'd be here. Hayase. Got a minute? It's about Haruka. Ever since she was a sophomore, she has liked you, Takayuki. Many boys have asked her to go out with them, but Haruka has never agreed to go out with anyone. Haruka was so single-minded, I wanted to do something for her, so that's when I started talking to you, Takayuki. I thought that if I could become friends with you, Takayuki, then it would be more natural for Haruka to get close to you, too. But at some point, I'd forgotten what my goal was. That's because I enjoy being together with you and Shinji-kun. I have Haruka to thank. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have been able to hang around with you guys. It's because of Haruka that we became friends. That's all I wanted to say. Bye. Hey, why so glulm!? Come on, cheer up! You shouldn't- this is a library! Come on, smile, smile! Yeah, yeah! Damn. Come with me! Suzumiya-san, I have something important to tell you. Suzumiya-san... I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear it. I don't want to go through any more pain. I don't care if we're through. I don't care if you hate me. But... but... if you say the words, I'll just... No! I'm sorry. ...do... like you. Would you please go out with me? What's happened has happened, but if I could turn back time, I wish we could do it over again. No. It took this long to hear the words, but there's absolutely no way I'd want to turn back time. Whatever time it may be, it will always be dear to me. So there's no way I'd want to turn back time. Yes, Hayase residence. Ah, just a moment. Mitsuki, it's Haruka-chan! Mitsuki?
