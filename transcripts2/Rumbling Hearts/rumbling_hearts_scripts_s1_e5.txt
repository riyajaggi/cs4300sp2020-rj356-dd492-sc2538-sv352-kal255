 Not even a middle-schooler would pull in that time! What have you been practicing these three years for!? Is this what you really want!? I thought you were going to join Forex once you won, weren't you? The trade team won't be so forgiving as to pick you after a performance like that! You're bringing down the others on the team! If you don't have your heart in this, then get out of here! ♪ Vie, young ones, in the hills of Hakuryo. ♪ ♪ Train and apply yourselves in this house of learning. ♪ Takayuki, are you home? Geez, he didn't lock it again. Come on, if you don't let the sunlight in once in a while, you're going to get mold. You didn't eat anything this morning, did you? I bought you a bento lunch, so make sure you eat it. Okay, I'm going back to work. Lock your door when you leave, okay? Yikes, is it this late already? They're going to get mad at me again. Yo, Hayase! What's the rush? Shinji-kun! Good timing! You saved me. My lunch break is almost over. Could you hurry, please? They're going to fire you if you don't work seriously. What about you, Shinji-kun? What are you doing here this time of day? You're going to flunk out. Back off. Hayase, did you go over to Takayuki's place again? Eh? Mm-hmm... Just leave him alone, already. It's been a year, now. You're always accommodating him, so he's getting spoiled, and it's delaying his recovery. Don't you think you should push away once in a while? Maybe you can say that... He's an adult now. Besides, Suzumiya's accident... ...wasn't really your fault, Hayase. It was my fault. "Hazawa Trading" Thanks. You really saved me. Don't push yourself too hard, now. Mm-hmm. Shinji-kun, push yourself a little more and study, okay? Shut up! See you later! I'm heading out now. Thanks for all your work. Well, what shall I make for him today? Mitsuki-sempai... Akane! Are you getting used to the school? Yes, well enough now. I'm the most promising hopeful in the club, and my grades are skyrocketing. You don't say. ls everyone in the swim club doing all right? Yes. But I'm a little disappointed. I didn't think they would be so cruel. It's disillusioning. Why? They may be a little strict, but they're not all bad people. Bub'. But they said such bad things about you, Sempai. They said the reason you couldn't join the trade team was because you were infatuated with a boy. None of them... none of them... ...know anything about what really happened. Akane... Thank you, Mitsuki-sempai. For helping Big Brother out with everything. O- oh, that's okay. I just do that on my own. He's my friend, and I can't just let him be, can I? He lives alone, so things aren't all that easy for him... Sempai, would you please keep looking after my sister and Big Brother? For sure... for sure, my sister will wake up from this. Until then... until then... Akane... Mitsuki-sempai, can I ask you a favor? What is it? They're shooting videos of our practices in the swim club now. If you could, would you look at my form and stuff for me? I can't tell too well on my own. Mm-hmm, sure. I don't know if I'll be any help, though. Yay! Okay then, Sempai, here, if you'd be so kind. For crying out loud, I told him to lock the door when he goes out. He's so careless. Ow! There... Must be nearly worn out. Hayase. Just a moment. I'll heat up your miso soup right now. Say, Takayuki, would you like to go out somewhere tomorrow and have some fun? I mean, it's Sunday, and you should get out once in a while... Why not? Tomorrow. Wow! Takayuki, look, look! They're incredibly pretty! Say, do you suppose it's okay to have this many different kinds of fish in one tank? Won't the big ones eat the little ones? Who knows? Geez, we've come all the way here, so why don't you try having a little fun? Hayase, let's go. What are you doing? H- Hayase! Come on, stop that! Are you mad? Hey, Takayuki, look, look! Don't you think these are cute? Not really. Say, would you buy these? That's fair, isn't it? I'm always making you dinner, after all. Okay? For the love of... These, please. "Okay. --Yay! Cut it out' It is nice to get out once in a while, huh? Thanks for everything today. What should we do? Want to have some tea? No, I'm going to stroll around a little more. --There's a book I want to buy. --Huh? Okay. Well, I'll call you later, okay? Yeah. "Picture Book Authors Exhibition" They're holding the picture book authors exhibition again. "Mayauru's Gift" Hello, this is Narumi. I'm not in at the moment. If you need to reach me, please leave a message after the beep. Takayuki? It's me. I guess you're not home yet. Would it be okay if I left the mug you bought for me over there? I'm heading over there now, okay? Takayuki? No, he's not here. Is something wrong? Uh-uh, everything's fine... I think... He seemed fine when I left him. But Takayuki doesn't have a cell phone. You're worrying about it too much. Anyhow, if I hear from him, I'll let you know. Please do. Haruka... "Call me when you get back. -Mitsuki" Haruka, they're holding the picture book authors exhibition again. Remember "Mayauru's Gift"? The author is coming to Japan as a guest. I know. You want to go, right? Huh? Right now? No, it's so late... on, all right... It would be a problem if we miss going again, huh? All right, if you say so, Haruka. Let's go. No, Narumi-kun hasn't come by today. I see. Visiting hours are over, so even if he does come, it won't be until tomorrow. --Is it something urgent? "Oh, no, it's fine. What are you doing!? You can't just take a patient away on your own! Stay out of our way! Let us go! Haruka said she wants to go! If we don't get going... ...if we don't get going soon, the picture book authors exhibition will be over! Let me go! Narum'l-kun'. I promised her! I promised Haruka! Out of my way! Get a hold of yourself! Even if you did go, she wouldn't be able to see it! You know that better than anyone, don't you? Haruka... It must be painful, staying in this place for so long, huh? But this is painful for Takayuki, too. And for me, as well. Why did it have to turn out like this? Why? If I'd known this, I would have... If I'd known this... Narumi-kun, I believe we have a pretty good idea of how much you feel for Haruka. But to be honest, it's painful for us to see you like this. I'm sorry, but please don't come to visit Haruka anymore. Please understand. This is for your sake, as well. I beg you, Narumi-kun, please don't come visit our daughter any longer. You'll catch cold. Geez, snap out of it! I know how you feel. This hurts me... this hurts me too, after all. There's nothing you can do, you know. Nothing you can do will wake her up. She won't answer you. No matter how much you feel for her, she won't answer you. There's nothing you can do. So... so Takayuki... Say something! You're still alive, aren't you!? Answer me! Why won't you answer me!? You idiot! I love you. I've always, always loved you. I pretended not to. I pretended not to know how I felt toward you... ...because I couldn't betray Haruka! But... but I can't take it anymore. I can't watch anymore. You, Takayuki, or me, either... Am I not good enough? "Hair Salon" Come on in! It's so blue... Hayase. I skipped work. You must be hungry, right? I'll make something, okay? Y- yeah. I wonder what happened to Big Brother. I'm getting out first, okay? Yeah. I wonder if Big Brother caught a cold or something... Big Brother? Are you home? Ah, Mitsuki-sempai is here. "Part time help wanted" This whole time... this whole time, you've been duping us... Akane... It stopped raining. Down the road we would always walk home on, hand in hand, I won't let go. I wish we could stay this way, but time keeps passing us by. ! only draw one dream in the night sky- I want to be your star, someday. The midsummer constellations shine down on us as the two of us quietly pray that we can stay together like this, staying true to our feelings. The light has just been born within our two hearts. Space, the final frontie- Hey! It was just getting good! But if you keep going like that, some scary people will come here from across the ocean! All right. Well then... This is the starship Sky Temple, with Daikuji Mayn- Sempai! Tch. Then how about... --Where no man has gone- --No!! Let go of me, Mayu-Mayu! Hey, don't push that! "Self destruct" Let go of me, Mayu-Mayu! Hey, don't push that!
