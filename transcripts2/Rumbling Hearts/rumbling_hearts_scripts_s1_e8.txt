 Hot! Good morning, Takayuki. "Episode 8" Oh, right. We're almost out of shampoo, so I'll buy some on the way home, okay? Oh, right. We're almost out of shampoo, so I'll buy some on the way home, okay? Should we keep using the same kind? Yeah. With the two of us, it sure disappears in a hurry, huh? Rinse, and body soap, and so on. Oh yeah, what should we have tonight? Is there anything you'd like to eat? Nope, not especially. Geez... Well, I'll think it over at the supermarket, I guess. You know what? Thinking up a menu is pretty fun. When there's someone else to eat it with, that is.

 Takayuki, when will you be home? Same as always, I guess. Oh yeah? If you're going to be late, give me a call. Yeah. Well, I'm off. "Same as always," huh? Good work, everyone. What's wrong? Come here a sec. What? This has been bugging me for a while now, but the Manager is acting strange. The Manager? Yes. For whatever reason, it seems like he's always watching us. We thought that even a dimwit like you would have noticed. Well, sure, it would bother me, too. You never know what you two are going to pull. What was that!? S- Sempai, we're in the temple! Sheesh, is that all? I'm out of here. Hey! Hold it, you dung beetle! There's more? His look is different from the look a manager gives to his subordinates. Any way you cut it, the looks are perverted. He has been beguiled by our charms, and now he's got dangerous thoughts running through his head. Oh, is that right? If that keeps up, might we be sold away somewhere? What's getting sold away, now? Mayu-Mayu, let's go tidy up out on the floor! Sempai, please wait for me! Did something happen? Huh? Oh, no... We're now pulling out. Now approaching Keyaki General Hospital. Those who are getting off, please indicate by pushing your button. Okay, stopping at the next stop. Bye. Ah, Boyfriend! Hello. We appreciate your efforts, coming here every day. Huh? Your expression seems tired somehow. After going to all the trouble to visit your girlfriend, you shouldn't show her a gloomy face. You should meet her with a more cheerful face' Oh, is that how I look? What's the matter? If there's something troubling you, please take it up with me. I, Amakawa-san, will fully accommodate you! Amakawa, that sounds kind of dirty. F- Fumio-chi, I didn't mean it like that! When you say you'll accommodate him, what and where, exactly? I told you, it's not like that! That's not the accommodation I mean! Narumi-san, it's not like that! That's the expression! Please go see her while wearing that smile. Even when bad things happen to you, you cheer up when you smile, don't you? Please smile always whenever you're with her. Takayuki-kun, you're always kidding me. I'm not kidding! Once you get out of the hospital, let's go eat there together. They really have plates this big, filled with food. Mm-hmm. I'm looking forward to it. Oh, is it this late already? I need to be getting home soon. I've still got studying to do. I'll be back. I want to stay with you a little longer, Takayuki-kun. Haruka... Takayuki-kun, don't you like being with me? That's not true at all. I'd like to stay with you forever, Haruka. You mean it? Yeah, I mean it. When I'm here talking to you, Haruka, I'm able to forget all the troubles I have, and I feel comforted. Really? I'm happy, too. Takayuki-kun, I'm happiest when you're here for me. Takayuki-kun... What, Haruka? So could you? Get better soon, Haruka. Hurry and get out of the hospital, so we can all have fun together like we used to, way back when. Way back when? Ever since the accident, time has stood still for her. There's no telling what will happen to her if she receives such a shock now, so you absolutely have to hide that from her. Oh, well, you know... I've been so busy lately, and things have been so hectic, so it feels like a lot of time has gone by... Haruka... Takayuki-kun... I wish we could stay like this forever. Oh, Takayuki, I'm sorry. I forgot to buy any shampoo. What are we going to do tonight? You know... that was quite a scary-looking woman. Huh? Who? The one from this afternoon. The one I saw on the bus. She's from your company, right? Ah, mm-hmm, her name is lshida-san. She does a good job of looking after things. She does, huh? You must be pretty busy with work. Uh-uh, not that much. Here, I'll get yours too, Mitsuki. Oh, thanks. You know, Takayuki... ...about Haruka... How's it going? How's it going? What do you mean? I was wondering if there's been any change. No, nothing. Same as always. I see. She's the same as always. Takayuki-kun? Takayuki it is! Mitsuki! Though I'm glad you're doing well, Haruka. Hang in there and get well soon, okay? It must be dull to always stay in the hospital, huh? It's okay. Takayuki-kun comes to visit me, after all. Yeah? Takayuki-kun comes to see me every day, even though he's busy studying. He does? He always stays by my side. Always. Does he? Takayuki-kun is so nice. He always tells me lots of funny stories. Being here, I know for sure, that I... ...really do love Takayuki-kun. I'm home. What's come over you all of a sudden? Takayuki... What? You're not going anywhere, right? You'll always stay with me, right? What's the matter? Has something happened? I'm scared... that maybe you won't come back, Takayuki. I went to see Haruka today. When I looked at her, somehow, it seemed like I was being drawn into her eyes. Takayuki, don't go visit Haruka anymore. Why not? Do you want to see her? Well after all, I promised Haruka's parents that I would work with them until Haruka recovers. Is that all? What do you mean by that? Why are you being so nice to Haruka? You're past her, aren't you? Or are you still not over her? Over her? What do you mean? That's silly. Haruka is your close friend, too, isn't she, Mitsuki? No. She's not my close friend anymore. I've betrayed Haruka, after all. Do you still feel responsible for Haruka's accident? Do you feel compassion for Haruka? Yeah... Do you still love her? Takayuki... As long as I don't see her, right? Maybe he ate some dog food he managed to scavenge. Usually, he'd be all giddy to go home around now. You're right. Uh-huh, he's been dumped. Really? Serves him right. If he had time enough to be in heat, he should have been working. Thank you for staying. I know you're busy. Nah, I don't have that other matter anymore, so from now on, I can be more flexible. That will be a big help. Manager? Yes, what is it? Is there something about those two that's weighing on you? Yes, they have been on my mind. Is it about their attitude toward the customers, or maybe their job proficiency? No, it's more of a personal sentiment. Oh? Is that unusual? No, but, isn't that a little bit wrong? Why would it be? Well, this is a place of business, after all, and then there's the difference in ages... No, she'd be right about that age. Manager? As it happens, I had a daughter, and I suppose... ...she would have been exactly the same age right about now. Perhaps I should have spent more time with her... Looking out the hospital window at the view was everything to my daughter. Takayuki-kun isn't coming, huh? "Takayuki- I prepared some breakfast for you in the refrigerator." "lust nuke it and eat. I've got to go. -Mitsuki" That will be ¥2625. Out of ¥3000. Takayuki, are you going out? Yeah. Where are you going? I thought you had today off from work, so I bought a bunch of stuff. My manager said he'd like me to put in more hours. I've given up going to the hospital, so I've got more time and freedom. That's what you wanted, right? Okay, number 3 is up! Right. Sempai! It's so busy, I'm getting dizzy! It's suppertime, after all. The underprivileged masses flock here to eat their dinner. Mayu-Mayu, table #6 is calling for their order. Coming right now. It's starting to rain... Akane-chan... Akane-chan'? Don't tell me something's happened to Haruka! Hey, you dung beetle! Would you get back in here! How long does it take the trash to take the trash out, boneheadl? Yes, this is Sky Temple. Yes, one moment please. Takayuki-san, telephone! For me? Here. Thanks. Yes, you're now speaking to Narumi. Takayuki? Oh, it's you, Mitsuki. Listen, I was thinking, we ought to have along talk. Can I come there? We can do that later, can't we? But... Where is that dung beetle, as friggin' busy as we are now!? If you mean Takayuki-san, he just got a phone call from a woman, and left in a hurry. He did what!? That was Narumi-san just now, huh? It was? Haruka! Takayuki-kun? You startled me. Haruka, are you all right? Am I all right? What do you mean? Why haven't you come to see me? You promised you'd come every day. Sorry. Is it hard? Studying for your exams? Y- yeah. Don't push yourself too hard and ruin your health, okay? Takayuki-kun, you're such a hard worker, you push yourself even when it hurts. I may not be able to do anything, but because I'm so fortunate, I'll be praying for you the whole time, Takayuki-kun. I'm full now. I've missed you. Stay here with me like this. Takayuki-kun... I'm so happy. I was worried you didn't like me anymore. That just isn't so. Haruka, I... I... I love you. Takayuki-kun, I love you. Haruka... I'd sure like to go to the festival with you again, Takayuki-kun. Yeah, this time, just the two of us. Haruka, once you get better and leave the hospital, we'll go. I'll be waiting for that. No.. I want to be with you, Takayuki-kun, as soon as possible. Haruka... Takayuki-kun... Takayuki-kun? There's no rush. The two of us can spin our time together slowly, isn't that right? Big Brother... I can't take it anymore... Down the road we would always walk home on, Hand in hand, I won't let go. I wish we could stay this way, but time keeps passing us by. ! only draw one dream in the night sky- I want to be your star, someday. The midsummer constellations shine down on us as the two of us quietly pray that we can stay together like this, staying true to our feelings. The light has just been born within our two hearts. They're smooching! Yes, Sempai! Smooching! Smooching! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Rewind. Smooching! Smooching! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! Smooch! "Anger"
