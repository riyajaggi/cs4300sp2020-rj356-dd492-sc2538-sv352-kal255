 I FEEL LIKE YOU CREATED A LOT OF THIS. AN OPTION FOR ME IS BREAKING UP WITH HER. TONIGHT, SADDLE UP FOR ROMANCE. HERE'S TO HORSES AND US. EPIC HORSE PLAY. OH! OH! I GOT A GAME THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL ALL RUBBED UP. I MIGHT HAVE BRUISED SOMETHING. AND YOU VOTE FOR THE MOST COMPATIBLE COUPLE. AS OUR TITLE CARD CLEARLY STATES, THIS IS "LOVE ISLAND," WHERE OUR COUPLES ARE DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF A DRAMATIC RECOUPLING. WITH IS...

 AND CALEB CHOSE JUSTINE, SENDING RACHEL HOME WITH A PROMOTIONAL "LOVE ISLAND" MOUSE PAD. HONESTLY, I THINK A LOT OF THE GUYS WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THE POWER IN THIS RECOUPLING. BUT THE GIRLS CAN KEEP IT, BECAUSE THAT WAS TOO MUCH PRESSURE. OH! YOU REALLY HAD MY HEART GOING TODAY. UHM, LIKE I TOLD YOU EARLIER, IT WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION. YEAH. IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU GO HOME, YOU KNOW. AND YOU MADE A REALLY STRONG PUSH. YEAH. TO THE FINISH LINE. AND I JUST WANT US TO CONTINUE TO KIND OF BUILD OFF OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED. LIKE, WE'RE DEFINITELY ON THE SAME PAGE. AND SO I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE'RE FINALLY COUPLED UP! IT'S THE TEETH FOR ME. IT'S THAT SMILE FOR ME. I'M SO EXCITED BECAUSE, I MEAN, I HAVE A FINE-ASS MAN WHO WANTS TO GET TO KNOW ME, AND WANTS TO SEE WHERE THINGS GO. AND... I'M JUST SO HAPPY! COME GIVE ME A HUG. MMMM! OH, YOU'RE SO TALL! GET USED TO IT. WHAT? OKAY. CELY HAD A GREAT NIGHT GETTING PICKED BY HER PERSONAL CHUNK-THROP JOHNNY, AND HAVING HER BESTY, JUSTINE, SAVED. THE GIRLS CHAT ABOUT WHAT A DEVASTATING NIGHT IT WAS HAVING EVERYTHING GO THEIR WAY. MY HEART, I LITERALLY COULD NOT LOOK AT YOU. I WAS, LIKE, OKAY, KEEP IT TOGETHER. YOU'RE YOU'RE STRONG. AND I LOOK OVER AT YOU, AND YOU'RE CRYING. AND I WAS LIKE THERE'S JUST NO WAY. I WAS TRYING THE ENTIRE TIME. CELY, THE WAY I WAS LITERALLY GOING TO JUMP IN THE FIRE. I'M LIKE, THIS IS IT. JESUS, TAKE THE WHEEL. IF JUSTINE GOT SENT HOME, I WOULD BE LIKE, JOHNNY, I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO GO. PACK YOUR BAGS. YOU HAVE 30 MINUTES. OH, MY GOD! I HAD JOHNNY TALKING ABOUT ME, RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD. LIKE, OH, MY GOD, WE'RE SO IN LIKE WITH EACH OTHER. AND I CONTINUE WITH MY BEST FRIEND JUSTINE. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE COUPLED UP WITH CALEB. LIKE, HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY. AND HE'S SO JUST... THE WAY HE CARRIES HIMSELF. GIRL, YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ALL OF YOU DOUBTED MY GAME, THOUGH. WHEN I TELL YOU, WHEN WE SAT DOWN I WAS LIKE, "MY GIRL'S GOING HOME." YOU'RE THE ABSOLUTELY WORST! I'M SORRY. I WAS SCARED, TOO, GIRL. OH, MY GOD. AFTER BEING WITH CELY AND JUSTINE, TRE... A.K.A. FEDORA THE EXPLORER... IS NOW IN THE LAND OF LAUREN. YOU CAME INTO THIS VILLA AS A SINGLE WOMAN, AND NOW YOU'RE COUPLED UP WITH A SERIAL KISSER. STOP! OH, MAN! HONESTLY, LIKE, TONIGHT, I FEEL LIKE I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. I AIN'T GOING TO LIE TO YOU. I GOT THE HOTTEST GIRL IN THE VILLA RIGHT NOW. SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT TONIGHT? I'M HAPPY THAT YOU PICKED ME, AND THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID I THOUGHT WERE REALLY SWEET. I'M INTERESTED IN GETTING TO KNOW YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO RUSH ANYTHING WITH YOU, OBVIOUSLY. EVERYTHING IS... WE'LL BE BEST TO JUST GO WITH THE FLOW AND LET EVERYTHING HAPPEN NATURALLY. BUT I'M EXCITED TO GET TO KNOW YOU. I AM, TOO. I FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING TO YOU. I CAME IN AND DEFINITELY HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT HIM AND, YOU KNOW, I NICKNAMED HIM "THE SERIAL KISSER" AND HE'S ACTUALLY REALLY COOL. SO HE'S A GOOD DUDE. WILL THAT TURN TO SOMETHING ROMANTIC? I DON'T KNOW. ALL WE CAN DO IS BE UP FRONT AND HONEST GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE EVERY DAY IN HERE IS A CRAZY SURPRISE. YES. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA. IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET CRAZIER. CARRINGTON WAS UPSET THAT KIERSTAN WAS UPSET THAT LAUREN CAUSED AN UPSET BY BEING SET UP WITH CARRINGTON. IT WAS UPSETTING. SO ARE THEY ALL SET, OR SET UP FOR MORE UPSET? I'M HAPPY WITH THE CHOICE I MADE TONIGHT. I THINK THAT THIS WEEK HAS BEEN DIFFICULT, BUT EVERYONE HAS DIFFICULT TIMES ONCE IN A WHILE. WE NEVER DID. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANYMORE, BUT I THINK THAT IT HELPED ME SEE THINGS AND HELPED YOU, LIKE... I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I'M GLAD THAT WE COULD WORK THROUGH IT. YEAH. I REALLY DO LIKE YOU. BY HOW MUCH? A LOT. LIKE A LOT-LOT? LIKE IF SOMEONE WALKED IN HERE, I WOULD BE LIKE I DON'T EVEN NEED TO HAVE ANY TALKS. AND IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE, BUT I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND. THE WHOLE THREAT WITH LAUREN, THAT'S OVER WITH. I TRUST CARRINGTON. I TRUST OUR COUPLE-SHIP. SO, NO, NO MORE BUTS. HE MEANS TOO MUCH TO ME TO LOSE HIM OVER SILLY LITTLE IMMATURE GAMES. IT'S ALL BEHIND ME. IT'S ALL BEHIND YOU, AND LET'S JUST HAVE A GOOD WEEK. UH-HUH. YOU SMELL LIKE HOT DOGS. WELL, I ATE BACON. I SAID I SMELL LIKE HOT DOGS. DID YOU COOK HOT DOGS? DID I COOK HOT DOGS? I DIDN'T COOK ANY HOT DOGS. WHY DO YOU SMELL LIKE HOT DOGS, THEN. YOU JUST SAID THAT. I SAID I SMELL LIKE HOT SAUCE. OH, HOT SAUCE, OKAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE, KIERSTAN DICTION, CARRINGTON HEARING, OR THEIR BREATH. I NEED A HOT DRINK TO RINSE THE HOT DOGS OUT OF MY EARS. I FEEL LIKE THE BALCONY IS WHERE I HAVE ALL MY IMPORTANT CHATS. I KNOW. OH, MY GOSH, WE'RE IMPORTANT. I WANTED TO CHECK IN AND SEE HOW ARE YOU DOING BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE VERY WORKED UP AS WELL AS I WAS, TOO. I THINK THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE BEEN... SO ROUGH. CONFUSING. YES. ROUGH. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO LAUREN AT ALL SINCE, LIKE, ONE ON ONE SINCE THE CHALLENGE YESTERDAY? WELL, I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN GOOD. SHE WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE... I'M KIND OF DONE WITH THAT BECAUSE WHY CHASE AFTER SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN, LIKE, CUT OFF. PRETTY MUCH THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. SHE TRIED TO REASSURE ME THAT SHE NEVER HAD AN INTEREST IN HIM. OH, REALLY? YEAH. I HEARD DIFFERENTLY. BECAUSE WHENEVER I WAS SITTING UP HERE WITH HER, I THINK THE DAY AFTER SHE HAD GOTTEN HERE, SHE WAS LIKE, "PEOPLE JUST NEED TO START TELLING THE TRUTH." I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER DATE WITH CONNOR AND SAYING HE WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON, LIKE, LITERALLY, AS SOON AS THEY TURNED THE CONNOR, HE WAS VERY TOUCHY-FEELY, MAYBE LIKE THEY BOTH WERE, AND THAT HE KIND OF OPENED UP SO MUCH. I WAS TAKEN ABACK BY IT. WELL, I AM AS WELL. AND HE DEFINITELY DID NOT EXPRESS THAT TO ME AT ALL. IT WAS A REALLY TERRIBLE FEELING TO FIND OUT ONE MORE THING I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. I DEFINITELY FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE TOWN FOOL. A LONG DAY. I'M TIRED! I KNOW! YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM FEELINGS IN HERE. HERE. WE'RE JUST LIVING OUT, LIKE, THESE LITTLE SINS. CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? DO YOU? YEAH, I THINK SO. AFTER LEARNING THE DISTRESSING TRUTH ABOUT CONNOR HOLDING HAND WITH LAUREN, MACKENZIE IS UPSET. BUT I'M SURE SHE'S JUST MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MO... HE'LL NEED A GREAT EXCUSE TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE. CAN I GRAB YOU FOR A SECOND? DO YOU? YEAH, I THINK SO. WHAT'S UP? SO, I JUST WANTED TO PASS ON TO YOU SOMETHING THAT KIERSTAN MENTIONED TO ME. SHE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH LAUREN, AND, APPARENTLY, LAUREN EXPRESSED THAT THE MOMENT YOU GUYS LEFT THE VILLA, THAT YOU WERE VERY TOUCHY-FEELY WITH LAUREN AND VERY INTERESTED IN GETTING TO KNOW HER. SO... WHENEVER WE DID GO ON OUR DATE, WE DID HOLD HANDS. I... WAS THAT WAY. HONESTLY, I DID DO THAT. AND I'M SORRY I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT. OKAY. THAT THAT WAS A PART OF... I DID NOT KISS HER. I GAVE HER A HUG. UH-HUH. SO THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU... I'M INTERESTED... I'M NOT... DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE NOT FORTHCOMING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU KNEW THAT IF I KNEW THAT, I WOULD PROBABLY BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HOW MUCH TIME YOU AND LAUREN HAVE BEEN SPENDING TOGETHER? THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE HAD WITH LAUREN AFTERWARDS HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR TOWARDS HER THAT I AM NOT INTERESTED IN HER. OKAY. I DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED HIM BEING MORE UPFRONT, LAUREN AS WELL, ESPECIALLY IF SHE WAS GOING TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT IT. I'M A VERY UNDERSTANDING PERSON. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE HONEST, THERE'S TYPICALLY A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. I THINK... I'M GOING TO GET CHANGED. OKAY. HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO RUN ME? THIS IS ON THE HOUSE. OKAY, THANK YOU. BEAUTIFUL GIRLS FOR FREE. OKAY, THANK YOU. LET'S DO SALON TALK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SALON TALK IS. UHM, YOU'RE DOING MY NAILS. YOU HAVE TO ASK ME IF I HAVE A BOYFRIEND? YOU HAVE TO ASK ME WHAT I DO? DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND? > NO, I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND. DO YOU WANT ONE? BUT I LIKE THIS GUY, AND I THINK HE LIKES ME. UH-HUH. HE WEARS THIS, LIKE, RIDICULOUS LAFFEN DERDO-RAG. HE SOUNDS LIKE A COOL GUY. RELAX THE HANDS. RELAX THE HANDS. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN. YOU'RE MESSING UP THE TREATMENT. OKAY. OKAY, OKAY. JOHNNY WANTS TO BE A BARBER, BUT I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, I THINK YOU NEED TO RETHINK THAT. HE HAD MY HANDS ALL OILED UP. HE HAS SOME REAL TALENT. THEY LITERALLY LOOK SO GOOD. YOU THINK SO? YES! DAMN, FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING. I KIND OF WANT TO PUT ANOTHER COAT ON A FEW OF THEM. AND NOW, TO EPISODE 479 OF TELE-NOVELLA, CONNOR AND MACKENZIE. CONNOR JUST CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT, YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS IT SUCKS TO HEAR AND IT'S UPSETTING, YOU KNOW, LIKE, WE MOVED PAST IT, AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE PAST IT, AND I JUST HOPE IN THE FUTURE YOU'LL BE HONEST FROM THE START. I'M JUST VERY HAPPY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, THAT IS... THAT WAS NOT THE POSITION THAT, YOU KNOW, I INTENDED TO COME FROM. I TOLD YOU, I'M UNDERSTANDING. YOU JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN PRACTICE YET. BUT YOU'RE SEEING IT RIGHT NOW. YEAH, I GET IT. SO THANK YOU. YEAH. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M IN SUCH A GOOD SPOT RIGHT NOW. YAY! I AM SO RELIEVED THAT CONNOR HAS FOUND HIS VOICE. I'M VERY REGRETFUL FOR ANY OF MY ACTIONS THAT MADE HIM FEEL AS THOUGH HE COULD NOT EXPRESS HIMSELF. I WAS NOT AWARE OF HOW MUCH HE WAS INTERNALIZING AT ALL. ALL. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HONEST WITH ME WHEN I ASKED, AND I REALLY DO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. OKAY. JUST DON'T LIE TO ME AGAIN, OKAY. OH, MAN. WHAT A DAY. I FEEL LIKE JUST SOY... DRAINED. YOU DONE GOOD. YOU DONE GOOD. JUST RELAX. YOU CAN HAVE SOME FUN NOW. I AM. DEFINITELY. I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR BODY. I'M ANYTHING TO CRY. THIS IS. ...LIKE, WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT'S THE REMEDY? WHEN PEOPLE SNORE, DO THEY SNORE ALL THE TIME? HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH? YOU SNORD THE WHOLE NIGHT. I CAN'T EVEN OPEN MY EYES. I'M GOING TO KILL YOU. DO YOU WANT TO TRY ON MY SHADES? DO YOU WANT TO TRY ON MINE? I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE IN THOSE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU... WHOA! YOU LOOK HOT! HOLY, COW! HECK, YEAH, BROTHER? HECK, YEAH, BROTHER! I CAN'T WAIT TO DRESS YOU. LIKE A LITTLE DOLL WHEN I GET HOME. LOOK LIKE A HARRY POTTER. YES! THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING FOR. HI, GUYS! HEY-HEY. WHAT'S UP? CUTE SHADES. THANKS. I CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOUR FACE TODAY. I KNOW. IT'S NOT SHIELDED. I KNOW. I DO LOVE MY BIG GLASSES. HOW ARE THINGS WITH CALEB? HE'S THE BEST. YESTERDAY IN BED, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN IN HERE AND, LIKE, ACTUALLY HAD, LIKE, GOOD, LIKE A NICE TIME BEFORE BED. DID YOU GET A TEXT? I GOT A TEXT! WHAT? UH-OH! CARRINGTON'S SWEATING. I'VE BEEN SWEATING. DID NOT EXPECT THAT. HEY! YOU'RE RIDING HORSES? I'M SO JEALOUS! SEE YOU LATER. HAVE FUN, GUYS. YOU ALL ENJOY YOURSELVES, NOW. GIDDYAP. YE-HAW! WE GOT A TEXT. WE'RE GOING TO A DATE, BABY. BYE! LOVE BIRDS! THIS IS "LOVE AFTER WE WIPED SANITIZER OVER THE ITALIAN VALLEY, KIERSTAN AND CARRINGTON GO IN SEARCH OF ABANDONED HORSES. THEIR MATCHING OUTFITS ARE A STYLE REFERRED TO AS "RANCH DRESSING." ARE YOU READY? DO YOU KNOW HOW TO RIDE A HORSE? I'M GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT. HELLO! HOW ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE? FIGURING IT OUT. WOW, PRETTY GOOD FOR A CITY BOY. CITY BOYS CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS. A NATURAL. OH! ALL RIGHT. SOMEONE LIKE YOU. I'M GLAD THAT WE GET TO DO THIS, ESPECIALLY FOR OUR FIRST DATE, BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE WHAT I KIND OF DO BACK HOME. WHEN YOU HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, IS THIS WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN THAT SMALL TOWN, RIDE HRSES? NO. WE'RE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SMALL TOWN, JUST LIKE TO BE EVERYTHING. LOOK AT THAT. WE SHOULD DO CHEERS. YES, WE SHOULD. TO ME LEARNING HOW TO RIDE A HORSE. YOUR FIRST TIME ON HORSEBACK. PEOPLE MAKE IT SEEM SO HARD. THIS IS WHO I AM. I LOVE LIVING IN THE CITY, BUT THIS IS HOW I GREW UP. I MEAN, I'D LIKE YOU TO VISIT TEXAS AFTER THIS, YOU KNOW, IF WE MAKE IT TO THE END. I THINK YOU'D HAVE A GREAT TIME. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT UTAH IS ABOUT, BUT I GUESS I'M WILLING TO FIGURE IT OUT. > UHM, OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE A TON OF THINGS I LIKE ABOUT YOU, AND I KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE. BUT I THINK IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE. SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT I DO HAVE TO GET USED TO IS I NEED SOMEONE TO KIND OF REASSURE ME MORE. I AM QUIET SOMETIMES. I THINK THAT, HONESTLY, I'M KIND OF THE OPPOSITE IN THAT WAY. I DON'T NEED SOMEONE TO CONSTANTLY TELL ME ME, LIKE. REASSURE YOU. I DON'T NEED SOMEONE TO REASSURE ME I'MS THERE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. I AM A TOUCHY PERSON. COMMUNICATION IS VERY IMPORTANT I WILL DO BETTER ON THAT, AND I THINK YOU CAN AS WELL. I MEAN, EVERYONE CAN, RIGHT? SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. WITH CARRINGTON AND KIERSTAN AT FULL GALLUP, BACK AT THE TROPICAL THEME STOOL BAR IT'S TIME FOR A CONFESSION THAT IS NOTHING SHORT OF CON-TRE-VERSIAL. HOW DO YOU THINK THEIR DATE IS GOING? I CAN'T PICTURE CARRINGTON RIDING A HORSE. IT JUST IS NOT SITTING RIGHT WITH ME. WEARING A COWBOY HAT WITH HIS COWBOY BOOTS. I THINK CARRINGTON IS, LIKE, THE BIGGEST SURPRISE FOR ME AS FAR AS, LIKE, FIRST IMPRESSIONS. SO HOW... WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM NOW THEN? NO, I THINK HE'S, LIKE, REALLY CHARMING AND ADORABLE. LIKE HE'S NOT... HE'S NOT AS, LIKE, CONFIDENT AS... YOU WANT TO JOIN THIS? PEOPLE WOULD THINK. PART OF ME WANTED CARRINGTON TO CHOOSE LAUREN SO I COULD CHOOSE KIERSTAN. I DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE A THING FOR KIERSTAN. BUT THE MORE THAT I TALK TO HER AND THE CLOSER I GOT TO HER, THEN I GUESS IT JUST SLOWLY STARTED BUILDING UP. IF, YOU KNOW, LAUREN ENDED UP PURSUING CARRINGTON, AND HE ENTERTAINED IT, THEN I GUESS IT WOULD LEAVE ME IN A GOOD SPOT. I'M NOT TELLING HER THAT UNTIL THE TIME IS RIGHT. WHAT! DO YOU THINK THEY'LL LAST LONG? I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE AT THAT POINT YET THEY'RE, LIKE, I REALLY, REALLY LIKE THIS PERSON. I THINK IT'S MORE, "I LIKE THIS PERSON A LOT AND I WANT TO KEEP GETTING TO KNOW THEM." DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? I FEEL LIKEY KIND OF KNOW HOW YOUR LIFE IS BACK HOME. SO I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH OUTSIDE OF WORK IS THAT CONTINUING? ARE YOU, LIKE, GOING ON WEEKENDS TO VEGAS, EVEN? JUST TELL ME ABOUT, LIKE, HOW YOUR LIFESTYLE IS BACK HOME. I JUST WANT TO KNOW. UHM, I HAVE FOR THE PAST I THINK THREE AND A HALF YEARS DONE BOTTLE SERVICE. I'VE BARTENDED. BUT WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY THAT I WORK IN IS VERY DRAINING. SO IT'S NOT A LIFESTYLE. I THINK I COULD FIT INTO THAT. I LOVE HAVING A GREAT TIME. BUT PERSONALLY, WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME AND WHERE I WANT TO GO, I KNOW THAT IF I DO KIND OF LIVE IN A PARTY SCENE, I WOULD NOT REACH MY GOALS. I DO LIKE WHERE THINGS ARE GOING. AND WE'RE IN THE VERY EARLY STAGE, AND IT COULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE, UNFORTUNATELY. SO I'M JUST GLAD THAT WORE TAKING THE TIME TO REALLY DIG DEEP. AND I THINK IT'S HONESTLY GOING PERFECTLY. SO CHEERS TO HORSES AND US. CHEERS TO THAT. CELY AND LAUREN PROVED THE OLD ADAGE THAT NOTHING BRINGS GIRLS CLOSER TOGETHER THAN A PRODUCER YELLING, "WE BOUGHT ALL THESE POOL TOYS AND NO ONE'S USING THEM!" HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY? I FEEL GOOD. I JUST... DON'T YOU WISH THAT WAS US ON THE DATE? YEAH, LIKE, I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. THAT DATE AND THAT CONNECTION, BUT, HONESTLY. FOR ME, IT'S, LIKE, LIKE, IN MY HEAD I'M LIKE KIERSTAN AND CARRINGTON, LIKE, THEY'RE GOOD, YOU KNOW. GOOD, YOU KNOW, BUT I CAUGHT A CONVERSATION... I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THAT YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT. BUT YOU WERE SITTING OVER HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS, LIKE, YESTERDAY OR A FEW DAYS AGO... ME AND CARRINGTON. YEAH. HIS BODY LANGUAGE. RIGHT. WAS VERY, LIKE... LIKE OPEN. TELLING OF... I FEEL LIKE HIS BODY LANGUAGE AND EVERY TIME WE HAVE A CONVERSATION, AND I LOOK AROUND AND SEE HIM, AND HE'S, LIKE, LOOKING AT ME. AND HE WILL ALWAYS SHOOT ME A SMILE, A LOOK. ALL. ALL I KNOW IS FROM WRS' SIDE, EVER SINCE THAT FIRST DATE SHE'S BEEN ALL IN. YEAH, AND MAYBE THEY'LL GROW CLOSER ASK HAVE TIME... OH, YOU NEVER KNOW. LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. IT FEELS, LIKE, STEAL. CARRINGTON AND KIERSTAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL THAT'S REALLY WORKING. AND IF HE COMES BACK AND HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, I'M NOT FEELING IT. LIKE, I WANT TO STILL GET TO KNOW YOU," I CAN REASSESS THE SITUATION. I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY TALK TO HIM AFTER THE DATE AND SEE HOW IT WENT, HOW HE'S FEELING, AND WHERE HIS HEAD IS AT. BECAUSE A DATE COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR THE GOOD OR FOR THE BAD. YEAH JOHNNY AND CELY RELAX BY A POOL THAT I'M SURE MONET WOULD HAVE NAILED IF HE WASN'T SO LAZY AND ACTUALLY MADE IT TO VEGAS. I WISH WE WERE ON A DATE TODAY. WE DESERVE ONE MORE THAN ANYONE, I FEEL LIKE. YEAH, I KNOW. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE THE REAL THING HERE. HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING, THOUGH? I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THEM... FIRST OF ALL, CARRINGTON HAS NEVER RIDDEN A HORSE BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. SPEAKING OF THE OUTSIDE AND EVERYTHING, I GUESS I REALLY HAVEN'T ASKED YOU, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IF WE WERE TO ACTUALLY START DATING? LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I'VE SAID IT A LOT, BUT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY DEMOCRATICKED SOMEONE LIKE YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE PART OF US... YOU MEAN, LIKE, REALLY HANDSOME, COOL, OUTGOING, FUNNY? ANNOYING. ANNOYING. SMART. I'M KIDDING. I THINK IT'S JUST HOW SIMILAR WE ARE. LIKE, THAT'S... THAT'S THE PART THAT I'VE ALWAYS LACKED. I'VE ALWAYS DONE THE WHOLE "OPPOSITES ATTRACT" THING AND IT WORKS FOR A WHILE BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH FUN. THAT'S WHERE MY OTHER RELATIONSHIPS KIND OF LACKED BECAUSE WE WERE NEVER IN SYNC WITH THAT TYPE OF STUFF. EVERYTHING SHIFTED WITH ME BECAUSE THIS IS GOING SO WELL. VICE VERSA WITH ME TO YOU. I'M A ONE-WOMAN MAN. I'M ALL ABOUT YOU. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CORNY, BUT I MEAN IT. I'M HAVING THE BEST DAY EVER. I FEEL LIKE EVERY DAY THAT I SPEND IN HERE JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER. AND TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT HE'S, LIKE, ALL IN WITH ME, LIKE, EXCUSE ME, SIR? LIKE, FINALLY! I'M JUST SO HAPPY. I THINK WE'RE ALL GOOD, BABY. I THINK WE ARE, TOO. EXCITED. I'M HAPPY. I'M LUCKY. LOOK AT JOHNNY AND CELY. LOOK AT THEM! THEY MAKE ME SICK! HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT LAST NIGHT? I FEEL PRETTY GOOD. YEAH. YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOUR DECISION? I DO. I JUST FEEL LIKE THE ENERGY SUP. I'M ENJOYING MYSELF. A GOOD TIME. SO I'M EXCITED. YOU'RE A GOOD TIME. WHERE ARE YOU AT, LIKE, IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP STAGE OF LIFE? HAVE YOU EVER LIVED WITH A BOYFRIEND? NO. HAVE YOU? I HAVE NEVER LIVED WITH A BOYFRIEND. I NEVER LIVED WITH A BOYFRIEND. YEAH. NOR A GIRLFRIEND. YEAH, MY PARENTS ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE, "GET MARRIED BEFORE YOU LIVE TOGETHER." BUT IT'S NOT GONE THAT WAY FOR ANY OF US. WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY LIKE? AWESOME. MY MOM IS THE BEST. SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE LIKE, DID YOU EAT?" SHE'S AWESOME. I LIKE HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. CELY, KEEP IT TOWN! I'M TRYING TO LISTEN. WE'RE SO CLOSE, AND WE'RE SUCH A BIG FAMILY. I THINK JUSTINE IS MY TYPE. SHE'S FINE, FIRST AND FOREMOST. DOWN TO EARTH. I REALLY LOVE THAT SHE'S FAMILY ORIENTED. AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF GIRL I'M LOOKING FOR. I FEEL LIKE FOR ME MY FAMILY IS THE BEST PART OF BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP. REALLY? YEAH. I FEEL THAT. I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN... I'VE BEEN THERE. THAT'S KIND OF THE HARDEST PART ABOUT I GUESS MY LACK BREAKUP IS MY LITTLE SISTERS REALLY LOOKED UP TO HER, AND THEY ASK ABOUT HER. THAT IS WHY, THOUGH, I HAVEN'T BROUGHT A LOT OF GIRLS AROUND MY FAMILY. JUST BECAUSE I KNOW THEY ARE SO COOL. CALEB IS SO RESPECTFUL. HE'S INTELLIGENT. HE'S, LIKE, KIND. HE'S CHARMING. AND I THINK MY MOM WATCHING THIS WOULD FINALLY BE LIKE, "JUSTINE, WELL DONE AM. AND I'M LIKE, "THANK YOU, MOM, THANK YOU. I'M DOING WHAT I CAN." DO YOU LOVE ME YET? I GUESS I GOTTA STEP IT UP. TIME TO CHECK IN ON MOIRA AND CALVIN, WHO WE HOPE IS USING SUNBLOCK REPRESENTATIVED SPH 50... BILLION. HOW IS MISS MOIRA? I'M DOING GREAT. WHERE IS YOUR HEAD AT IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, IF PEOPLE WALK THROUGH. I'M SURE THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE GUYS THAT WALK THROUGH AND MORE GIRLS AS WELL. I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT, I'M, LIKE, SO SMITTEN WITH YOU. I DON'T FEEL LIKE MY HEAD COULD TURN. BUT, YEAH, FOR NOW, YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY IN HERE THAT I'M INTERESTED IN GETTING TO KNOW. THE CONNECTION THAT WE HAVE IS STRONG. AND THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M VERY ATTRACTED TO YOU AS WELL. BUT, YOU KNOW, IF NEW GIRLS COME IN, I DO PLAN ON TALKING TO THEM AND GET TO KNOW THEM, AND NOT ONLY IN A FRIENDSHIP, BUT JUST KIND OF TALK TO THEM AND WEIGH THINGS OUT. I DO PLAN ON DOING THAT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN IN HERE A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. OKAY, SO I FEEL LIKE MAYBE I'M MOVING A LITTLE BIT QUICKER IN TERMS OF, LIKE, I DON'T PLAN ON GETTING TO KNOW ANYONE ELSE. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK WE'RE, LITERALLY, LIKE SEEING EYE TO EYE ON ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. YEAH, AND THE WHOLE TAKING IT SLOW INSTEAD OF JUST RUSHING IN, JUMPING IN HEAD FIRST, AND WANTING TO BE ALL OVER EACH OTHER AND I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT. BECAUSE IT'S HELPED ME TO REALLY NOT FEEL A TON OF PRESSURE EITHER WAY. CALVIN HAS MENTIONED THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE TO P.D.A., AND I RESPECT THAT. BUT, HONESTLY, I WOULD GET A LITTLE BIT PISSED IF I FIND OUT IT'S FOR REASONS THAT HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS OPTIONS, LIKE, SUPER OPEN, AND ALMOST JUST HAVE ME AS A FRIEND. CALVIN IS TAKING IT SLOW, SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T DO WHEN YOU GET TO VOTE FOR THE MOST COMPATIBLE COUPLE AT THE END OF TONIGHT'S EPISODE. I HOPE THIS ADVICE HELPS AS MUCH AS JUSTINE'S ADVICE HELPS MOIRA... SEAMLESS NARRATION. YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT CALVIN. SEA DOG. YEAH. YEAH, SO WE HAD THE CHAT. AND HE WAS SAYING HOW HE FEELS GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. YEAH. BUT HE THEN SAID HOW HE DOESN'T WANT TO, LIKE, TAKE ANYTHING FURTHER, LIKE, PHYSICALLY. HE'S, LIKE, HAPPY THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT. AND ARE YOU ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT? I WAS, LIKE... ARE YOU? I DON'T THINK SO. WELL, OKAY, BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE HERE IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, SUCKING FACE. AND THEN CALVIN AND I, LIKE, DON'T EVEN, LIKE, WE DON'T EVEN FLIRT. DON'T FLIRT? IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS FLIRT. YEAH... I DO ENJOY MY TIME WITH HER. SHE'S A COOL GIRL. INITIALLY I FELT A SPARK. BUT NORMALLY, OUTSIDE OF THE VILL AI'M LOOKING FOR FIREWORKS. PERSONALLY. I'M NOT SAYING I DON'T LIKE HER. AND THAT CAN CHANGE, AND THAT CAN GROW. BUT INITIALLY, THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS WHERE IT WAS, LIKE, IF THERE'S NOT THE FIREWORKS, IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN? I DON'T KNOW. BUT IF IT DOES, I DO WANT TO PUT MYSELF IN A POSITION WHERE I'M ABLE TO EXPLORE THAT WHILE STILL BEING OPEN WITH HER. I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED. BECAUSE THEN HE SAYS THAT HE'S KEEPING HIS OPTIONS OPEN. YEAH. TO GETTING TO KNOW NEW GIRLS. HE HASN'T BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO REALLY, LIKE, JUST BE HERE FOR ME. AND THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT I MENTIONED TO HIM THAT WE ARE, LIKE, SEE DIFFERENTLY ON. AFTER A LONG DAY HORSING AROUND, THE ISLANDERS AWAIT THE RETURN OF CARRINGTON AND KIERSTAN FROM THEIR LONG DAY HORSING AROUND, UNAWARE OF TRE'S SECRET CRUSH ON KIERSTAN, JOHNNY SAYS THIS: I THINK YOU AND LAUREN ARE GOING TO HIT IT OFF. ALL I HAVE DO IS HOPE SO. IF I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT SNORING AGAIN. LET HIM SHOOT. .>> HELLO! COME ON OVER! TELL US EVERYTHING! WE MISSED YOU! YOU HORSE WRANGLERS! HE DIDN'T FALL OFF? NO. HE SURVIVED. IT WAS FUN. IT WAS WAY FUN. WOW, YOU GOT DOWN AND DIRTY. LOOK AT THOSE SHOES. WELCOME BACK, MY BROTHER. I SMELL LIKE HORSE. I HOPE I DON'T FEEL BAD. IT WAS A DOPE DAY, HONESTLY, MAN. WAS IT THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE? NO, BUT IT WAS A GREAT DAY. IT WAS FUN. I WAS REALLY HAPPY FOR HIM TO SEE ME, LIKE, IN MY ELEMENT, SHOW HIM A DIFFERENT SIDE TO ME THAN THE BOTTLE SERVICE, AUSTIN NIGHTLIFE, YOU KNOW. CHILLED. YEAH. YEAH. HE WAS, LIKE, HE WAS, LIKE, THAT WAS AWESOME. IT WAS A FUN DATE, MAN. ARE YOU CLOSER WITH HER? DEFINITELY, YEAH. THE CONVERSATIONS WENT WAY SMOOTHER THAN THEY HAVE, LIKE, THE LAST DAY OR TWO. BUT I DO SEE THAT SHE IS GIVING ME A TON OF EFFORT, AND, YOU KNOW, I MIGHT NOT BE GIVING HER THAT SAME EFFORT. AND IT'S HONESTLY BECAUSE I AM NOT ALL THE WAY THERE YET. I STILL JUST KIND OF NEED TO TAKE IT A LITTLE SLOWER. THERE WAS ONE MORE THING THAT KIND OF PISSED ME OFF, AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR. BECAUSE, LIKE, WE WERE TOASTING, BASICALLY SAYING GREAT THINGS. BUT THEN HE KIND OF INCLUDED SOMETHING LIKE, "WE NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR WHO COULD?" I'M LIKE DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. IS HE OPEN TO MEETING OTHER PEOPLE? I TOLD HIM I WAS ALL IN. HE SAID HE NEEDS TO BE SURE. HE SAID HE WAS ALL IN BEFORE. IF YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY ALL IN... THEN DONT SAY THAT. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD IGNORE THESE THINGS. AS MUCH AS I WANT YOU GUYS TO BE TOGETHER AND WORK IT OUT, I FEEL LIKE HE IS IN SOME WAYS LEAVING LITTLE BREAD CRUMBS FOR YOU TO... PICK UP ON. YEAH. I'M NOT BLIND. I KNOW THERE ARE THINGS THAT HE SAYS THAT I CAN'T IGNORE. I KNOW MEAS HE'S NOT ALL IN, AND THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES OF HIS HEAD BEING TURNED. BUT I WANT HIM IN MY LIFE. IF THINGS CHANGE, THEN I CAN'T CONTROL IT. BUT, I MEAN, THIS GUY IS... THIS GUY IS SOMETHING ELSE. WE'RE MOVING AT A GOOD PACE. I'M GOING TO TAKE IT DAY BY DAY. MY HEART COULD GO ONE WAY OR GO THE NEXT WAY AND I HAVE TO ACT ON IT, I CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO GET DRINKS. TRUST ME, IF A CLOWN EVER SUGGESTS PLAYING THIS BALLOON GAME IT MIGHT BE ASKING YOURSELF WHY YOU WENT TO A CIRCUS IN A BASEMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE. HEY, ISLANDERS! WHO WANTS TO PLAY? SO ME AND JOHNNY ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONES. WE'RE GOING TO STAND WITH OUR BACKS TO YOU GUYS. YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO RUN UP, GIVE US A SEXY THRUST, POP OUR BALLOONS, WE'LL RUN BACK, AND NEVER PERSON UP, AND LET'S SEE YOUR BEST BODY THRUST, MAY BE! ALL RIGHT, PARTY PEOPLE, ON MARK. GET SET. GO! I THINK I WITHIN A LITTLE HARD IN THERE. I MIGHT HAVE BRUISED SOMETHING. I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHAT. .>> IT WAS VERY EASY TO SEE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF BENT-UP SEXUAL TENSION IN THE VILLA. I DO WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO CALEB BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I, LIKE, HUMPED HIM, AND THE BALLOON WASN'T THERE. POSITION MYSELF RIGHT, JUST ALL HIP MOTION. AND ONCE YOU GET THAT DOWN, YOU'RE FINE. GO, GO, GO! I WAS HAVING TROUBLE POPPING THE BALLOONS, SO I HAD TO REALLY, LIKE... SLOWED US DOWN, WE TOOK THE SLOWED US DOWN, WE TOOK THE LOSS, BUT I STILL HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE. THAT WAS FUN. BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS FUN AS 55 TING INTO TALKING ABOUT CAESARS! AT 550 FEET, THE HIGH ROLLER IS THE HIGHEST OBSERVATION WHOLE IN THE WORLD, THE BEST PLACE TO VIEW THE STUNNING VEGAS STRIP. THINKING VEGAS? SOMETHING THAT'S SO BIG, IT HAS NO BUSINESS BEING A WHEEL. IT'S BEEN A CRAZY NIGHT IN THE VILLA THUS FAR, AND WITHOUT FEAR OF PUTTING MYSELF FOOT IN MY HOWTH, IT MAY GET WILDER. NEVER HAVE I EVER SUCKED TOES. OH! A GAME OF "NEVER HAVE I EVER" IS AFOOT. THE FIRST ISLANDER WILL SAY SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER DONE. IF SOMEONE HAS DONE THAT ACTION AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE, THEY MUST TAKE A SIP. NEVER HAVE I EVER HAD A THREE SELL. EVERY FIVE SIPS, THAT PERSON MUST DO A DARE. FIRST UP IS CARRINGTON. GIVE KIERSTAN A LAP DANCE. YEAH! WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. JOHNNY, YOU HAVE TO SUCK ON HER TOES. NO! SUCK THOSE TOES. SUCK THOSE TOES. SO INTO THAT! GIVE A PASSIONATE KISS. I CONFIDENTIAL DO WANT TO KISS MOIRA. A LITTLE SHORT IF YOU ASK ME. BUT THAT WAS OUR FIRST PASSIONATE KISS. KISS TRE FOR TWO SECONDS. DAMN, THAT GERL HAS SOME POWER. UNBUTTON CALEB'S SHIRT. KISS HIM FROM THE CHEST TO THE EARS. I HATE THAT MY PARENTS HAVE TO WATCH THIS AND SEE THIS SIDE OF ME, BUT I'M LIKE... THIS IS PART OF DATING! I WAS SUPER EMBARRASSED BUT I WAS HAPPY WITH THAT DARE. IT WAS A LOT OF FUN. WHAT? WHO... >> WHOA! NOT ME. I GOT A TEXT! ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU GUYS LATER. DO YOU GUYS WANT IT? YES! SHOULD WE DISCUSS IT FIRST? I MEAN, LIKE, WE KNOW YOU...
