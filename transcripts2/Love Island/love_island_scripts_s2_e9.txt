 ISLANDER LAUREN IS GOING ONTHREE DAYS. I'M GOING TO GO WITH. SHE CHOSE JOHNNY ANDCARRINGTON FOR TWO OF THEM. BUT IN WHAT WILL UNDOUBTEDLYBE THE MOST CONTROVERSIALITY SELECTION OF 2020, AMERICA VOTEDFOR CONNOR, A DECISION MACKENZIE ACCEPTED WITH A QUIET DIGNITYAND GRACE. WHY WOULD AMERICA DO THIS TOME? WHY WOULD THEY TAKE MYBOYFRIEND? OH PIE GOODNESS. LOOK AT THIS. OKAY. FIRST TIME FOR. MY FIRST. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. THIS IS ABSOLUTELYINCREDIBLE. CHEESIER. BEGINNING OF THE HOUSE. FIRS TIME OUT OF THE VILLA. ONLY TOOK YOU ONE DAY, TOOK METEN DAYS. BUT WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW ANDTHAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS CONNOR, I'MREALLY HAPPY THAT IT DID HAPPEN, I JUST WANT TO TALK TO TODAY, ATSOME POINT, EVEN TO GET TO KNOW YOU ON SOME FRONT, WHO IS THISPERSON? CAN I GIVE YOU MY HONEST BEENOF YOU... OPINION OF YOU WHEN I SAW YOU THIS MORNING. I WILL KEEP IT THIS PORNG. PERFECT. ARE YOU A VERY BEAUTIFULGIRL. YOU HAVE THIS UNIQUE ENERGY THATYOU BROUGHT JUST ABOUT YOU. IT SEEMED LIKE YOU HAD SUCH ANAIR OF CONFIDENCE, YOU WERE EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. WHOOO BOY, BACK AT THE VILLAMACKENZIE IS STILL IN A STATE OVER THIS DATE. SO WHERE DOES YOUR HEAD GOWITH AMERICA VOTING. IT GOES WITH THEY THINK I'MNOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR CONNOR. AND THEY THINK THAT HE DESERVESBETTER. WHY WOULD THEY PICK HIM? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING. I THINK THAT THEY THINK THAT IDON'T DESERVE HIM. I WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT WITHYOU THOUGH. I SEE AN EVEN MATCH. THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS NOT ANOPINION THAT I HAVE, IS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED THATMAYBE YOU HAVE BEEN CONTROLLING OF CONNOR. OR MAYBE YOU HAVE HAD EXTREMEREACTIONS ABOUT THE WAY THAT HE HAS CARRIED HIMSELF. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT IS TRUE ATALL? I JUST DON'T SEE HOW ICONTROL HIM. I THINK THAT IS JUST, I THINKMOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW CONNOR VERY WELL. HMMMM. BUT HOW IS IT I'M CONTROLLINGWHEN CERTAIN COUPLES SPEND ALL DAY TOGETHER, ALL DAY. I JUST LIKE, I GUESS I JUSTDON'T GET WHERE THAT IS COMING FROM. AND I LITERALLY CONSCIENCELYVOICED IT. AND I EVEN ENCOURAGED CONNOR, GOTALK TO THE NEW GIRL, GO TALK TO HER, HE IS LIKE, I DON'T WANTTO. TONIGHT IT IS SO HARD, I JUSTWANT TO BE WITH HIM. AND I JUST HAVE IN FEAR. AND I KNOW HOW UPSET HE PROBABLYIS ON THAT DATE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE PROBABLY KNOWS HOWUPSET I AM. AND THAT IS JUST THE KIND OFPERSON CONNOR IS. IS HE ALWAYS THINKS ABOUT MYFEELINGS. I AM INTERESTED IN YOU. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN KIND OFFILTERING MYSELF TO ACCOMMODATE SOMEONE ELSE. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THEREARE CERTAIN THINGS OF MA KENSY I KNOW INHASN'TLY ARE WHO SHE IS. AND I REALIZE THAT THERE AREINCOMPATIBILITIES WITH US. AND THINGS I JUST CAN'T CHANGE. NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY. YOU ARE OKAY. YEAH. DO YOU NEED HELP? BLINK TWICE. NO. YOU SEEM TRAPPED. I PLAYED A BIG PART IN THAT. I AM NOT SURE YOU REALIZELIKE LIVING THIS CAN ONLY LAST SO LONG UNTIL YOU EITHER GETOVER IT OR YOU EXPLOAD. NO, ARE YOU CHALLENGING TO BEHONEST WITH MYSELF AND MAKING ME THE BE COMFORTABLE TO SAY IT TOYOU. I AM VERY MUCH OPEN IN GETTINGTO KNOW YOU MORE. AND GETTING TO KNOW YOU ON AMORE PERSONAL LEVEL. THEN YOU HAVE. I KNOW I DO. GIVE ME LIKE, A SIGNAL, GIVEME AN EYE CODE OR SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE LIKE, WE'LL GO TALKOVER HERE. I'LL GIVE YOU A DOUBLE WINKOR SOMETHING. BECAUSE THIS SCAWRS ME, ICAN'T IMAGINE HOW YOU FEEL. BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP LIVING FOROTHER PEOPLE, BABY. WHILE CONNOR FINISHES HISINTERVENTION... SORRY, DATE. MACKENZIE IS JUST STARTING HERIN-FRAYVENGS. DO YOU WANT ME TO BECOMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU. SURE, YEAH. I THINK. I THINK THAT CONNOR IS THENICEST GUY HERE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT HOW YOUACT SOMETIMES PUTS CONNOR IN A GOOD SPOT. BECAUSE CONNOR WOULD NEVER WANTTO HURT YOU. BUT WHEN YOU REACT LIKE WHEN YOUWALK OFF IN THE SITUATION THAT HE CAN'T CONTROL, YOU KIND OFPUT HIM IN A TOUGH SITUATION. I RAN AWAY FROM THE TABLEBECAUSE I WAS SO DEF VAITED. BECAUSE... DEVASTATED. BECAUSE FOR ME, MY WHOLE LIFE ISBECAUSE I ALWAYS FELT LIKE I WAS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH. I FELT LIKE I WAS NEVER GOODENOUGH FOR FRIENDS. I FELT LIKE I WAS NEVER GOODENOUGH FOR A GUY. I WAS CONSTANTLY CHEATED ON ANDBROKEN UP WITH. AND I AM SO AWARE OF HOWINCREDIBLE CONNOR IS. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS, ITSEEMED LIKE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WAS THISWAY. I AM LIKE HOW IS THIS PERSON OUTTHERE FOR ME THAT IS SO PERFECT FOR ME. HOW. JUST PLEA, PLEASE BE. JUST GIVE HIM A HUG AND AKISS. THAT IS LITERALLY. WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE IDON'T WANT TO DO THAT. NO, I LEAR T I HEAR ALITTLE. HERE HE COMES. OH NO, NO, ACT ACT COOL, ACTCOOL. HELLO, HELLO. OH, OH. DON'T LEAVE AGAIN, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT. CAN I TALK TO YOU IN A BIT. SIT AND TALK FOR A LITTLEBIT. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WAS SAID, HOW IT WENT. SO YEAH, SO BASICALLY THECONVERSATION KIND OF REVOLVED AROUND JUST GETTING TO KIND OFKNOW HER AND JUST HOW SHE FELT, AND BEING COMPLETELY HONEST. SHE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLEENOUGH TO COME UP TO ME BECAUSE OF WHERE WE WERE AT. AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD THEPOINT WHERE SHE WAS COMING FROM. SO I GUESS I'M SEEING ON THISDATE DID YOU TRY TO DO ANYTHING TO REASSURE HER THAT YOU WEREEQUALLY WANTING TO BE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MAY AND THATI'M NOT CONTROLLING? WITHIN. SO THE ENTIRE CONTROLLINGRELATIONSHIP PART WAS... WAS THE TOP YOU CAN OF CONVERSATION THATWE TALKED ABOUT. AND HOW I NEED TO BE ABLE TO BEHONEST WITH MYSELF TO BE HONEST WITH SOMEONE ELSE. UH-HUH.

I FEEL LIKE HAVE I TO EXPRESSTHAT YOU FEEL AS THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN HIGHS AND LOWS, ANDYOU'RE CONCERNED THAT LIKE THAT IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU.

ALL THE ISLANDERS HAVE HAD ATOUGH DAY GOING DOWN WATER SLIDES AND SEXY OUTFITS ANDMAKING OUT ALONGSIDE GERMAN SPORTS CARS WHILE THEY GETAPPLIEDED. TIME FOR SOME SEPARATE CHATS TOCLEAR THE SUDDENS. SO AWKWARD AND RACHEL, I WILLPULL YOU SO WE CAN TALK, OBVIOUSLY. BUT FOR ME I JUST FELT LIKE MYDECISION WAS BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT TRE AND I TALKED ABOUT. I FELT LIKE IF I KISSED HIM INTHE CHALLENGE TODAY, IT WOULD ONLY CONFUSE HIM MORE BASED ONTHE CONVERSATION WE HAD. BUT AGAIN I'M JUST LIKE, I'M HERFOR ME IN HERE. AND I JUST KIND OF HAVE TO STARTTHINK BEING THAT MOVEK FORWARD. AND I FEEL LIKE SO FAR I HAVEN'TBEEN DOING THAT. YEAH. I'M JUST SURPRISED, HONESTLY, SHOCKED. CAN I SEE IT ON YOUR FACE. I THINK WE ALL WERE. YEAH. LIKE HER AND RACHEL ARESUPPOSED TO BE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS. YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS IN BEDWITH HER, I WAS TRYING TO TB TO SLEEP AND THEN SHE WOKE ME UP. LIKE TOUCHING ME AND TRYING TOTALK TO ME. SHE WAS SAYING THAT SHE MISSEDME AND THAT SHE LIKED ME AND ALL THIS STUFF. AND THAT IS WHY I FEEL LIKE I'MTHE MOST SHOCKED AND CONFUSED. I DON'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE SAY ONETHING AND THEN DO ANOTHER. IT KIND OF LIKE IS LIKE A SLAPIN THE FACE, JUST DISRESPECT. HI BAE. HI GUYS. HOP ON IN, THE WATER ISLITERALLY WARM. DID YOU HAVE FUN. IT WAS REALLY FUN. I AM NOT MAD AT YOU. YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TODO. I FELT... I HOPE SHE DOESN'TFEEL BAD THAT I CHOSE HIM. OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T LIKE IT. I CAN'T HELP THAT YOU FEELTHAT CONNECTION WITH HIM. YOU DID HAVE TWO GIRLS TOKISS. HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THEMCOMPARED TO ONE ANOTHER. I VOTED FOR LAUREN BECAUSE ITWAS OUTRIGHT BETTER BUT I WOULD SAY I LIKED KIERS TAN'S MOREBECAUSE SHE BROUGHT IT AND I DID NOT THINK SHE WOULD AND IT WASVERY IMPRESSIVE AN HOT. HOW WAS IT? HOW WAS. I THINK WE ALL FELT IT. I FELT LIKE I WAS KISSING YOU. I LOOKED AWAY AND WHEN ILOOKED BACK IT WAS STILL GOING. LIKE IT WAS. REALLY. IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WASTHAT LONG. AND THEN WE ALL SAW HISREACTION. AND KIND OF FEELING NUMB AT THISPOWNT AND I'M ANGRY. I WANT HIM TO PICK ME. BUT I CAN'T CONTROL IT. SO THERE IS NO REASON IN TRYINGTO DWELL ON IT BECAUSE IN MY PAST THAT IS ALL I WOULD DO, JUST FEED INTO MY EMOTIONS AND JUST YOU KNOW LET IT PLAY OUTAND JUST, I DON'T KNOW, I JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. IT'S SOMETHING AS LITTLE AS ASEXY SOAPY DANCE AND A KISS CAN CHANGE US, MY DAY ONE, TH'N IDON'T WANT IT. I MEAN I DESERVE BETTER. WHAT A DAY. I WISH... INTO THE TO GO. RACHEL IS STILL ANGRY ATJUSTINE FOR KISSING CALEB DURING THE WET T-SHIRT CONTEST. I MEAN CARWASH COMPETITION. TIME FOR HER TO OPEN THE VENTWITH KIERSTAN. I WISH THAT SHE WOULD HAVETOLD ME. BEFORE. YEAH. HERE IS THE THING, ST NOT THEFIRST TIME THAT ME AND JUSTINE HAVE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION. LIKE THE THING IS, IS THAT IDON'T THINK THAT I CAN BE LIKE ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIEND NTIONTHE VILLA. IF IS COMPLETELY OKAY TO FEALBECAUSE IF THAT HURTS YOU AND YOU'RE FEELING THE FEELINGS, EVERYTHING YOU ARE FEELING IS VALID. I THINK JUST AT THIS POINTI'M JUST SITTING HERE LUKE SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE. BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL OKAY ABOUT ALL OF THIS. I THINK THE MOST UPSETTINGPART FOR ME IS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT JUSTINE WAS GOING TOCHOOSE CALEB UNTIL SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO CHOOSE CALEB. AND CAN I NOT BALANCE A TRUEFRIENDSHIP WITH JUSTINE AND HAVING HER BE INTERESTED INSOMEONE THAT I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN. THE REASON WHY I'M PISSSED ISI KNOW IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGSWHERE ST JUST ANNOYING THAT IT FEELS LUKE THE LIMITED TIME WEHAVE IS SPENT TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. EXACTLY. WHOOO. JUSTINE'S SMOOCH CREATED MOREDRAMA THAN A BIEBER FAN AT A ONE DIRECTION CONCERT. TIME FOR HER AND TRE TO DISCUSSWHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY KNEW ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. MY DECISION ON THAT WAS BASEDON THE CONVERSATION WE HAD YESTERDAY AND BECAUSE OF IT. AND I FELT LIKE IF I HAD PICKEDYOU I FEEL LIKE WITH EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SAID YESTERDAY ANDDID THAT TODAY, I FEEL IT WOULD HAVE CONFUSED YOU FURTHER.

I HOPE THAT CONNOR FEELSSTRONGLY ENOUGH ABOUT OUR RELTIONSHIP THAT HE WOULDCHOOSE TO CONVEY TA HE IS... CONVEY THAT HE IS NOTINTERESTED IN BEING PICKED BY HER. I TRUST HIM COMPLETELY. THE WAY SHE IS BEHAVING I'MHAVING TROUBLE TRUSTING HER. I THINK THOSE THOUGHTS AREVALID. I FEEL LIKE... I DIDN'T KNOWYOU TALKED TO HIM TODAY.
