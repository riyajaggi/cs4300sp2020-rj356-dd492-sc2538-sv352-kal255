I know that's important to you. Okay, so I've taken this all into account, and I think I know what we're gonna do. We're gonna go to the beach, we're gonna pick up some beach babes, and we're gonna bring them back to this sick little pad and party rager-style all night. Love that idea. Let's do it. Okay, 'cause what I want to do is I want to get some, like, dank seaweed, and I want to, like, put it in one of those trumpet shells and smoke it. It's called a cock shell. I saw that in an underwater porno once. Little Sperm Maid. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna smoke out of the cock shell.

These chicken doinkers bothering you, Gina? Jesus, Carson, I'm allowed to have a conversation. We're just, you know, talking. No one's bothering anybody. Not a chicken doinker, so. - Really? - Nope. 'Cause it looks to me like you freaking chicken doinkers... Mega freaking chicken doinkers! Were trying to dominate those three young girls, and that does bother me. Did you not see us? Because we definitely did, fair and square. They're children. We're grown men. - We're gonna win. - Well, hey, man, you seem cool, so, why don't we do things this way? One game of v-ball.

You can't go for a swim in jeans! Speak for yourself. Pretty sure a j-nats two-fly champion's not gonna have a problem. Come here! I got you! Come here! I got you! I said kelp! "A lot of kelp!" But I might need help. I think I'm drowning. The jeans! They're weighing me down! We got to peel down. Get the jeans off. Okay, hold on! Guys, hold each other! Grab my hand! Let the current take us! Ders! Let the tide take us? I'm... We're on dry land. You're welcome. Small dicks are the new regular-size dicks. Yeah, it's 'cause of the energy drinks. Right, yeah, the taurine. Taurine is making America's dicks small. My balls and my dick fit in it. This feels great! What? We got to find clothes now. - Yeah. - Right there. Let's grab those. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Adam. - What kind of clothes are these? - Doesn't matter. Just grab 'em. What the hell? - Get your butt off my butt! - Shut up! "Doesn't matter. Just grab it." What? I like my outfit, actually. I look like ScHoolboy Q. My God. This sucks. Sunset is in, like, two hours, I don't have a damn shrimp to my name, and now I have a bunch of pubic hair in this conch. You know what really sucks? I'm not on Kookslams, but this guy right here, he falls off a skim board, and he shatters his neck and his ankle and his ribs, and he makes it? Sure. Come on. Hey. Whoa. Dude. That's not my phone. I found it in these pants, so. I know we're hurting, right? But the best medicine for this kind of pain is a woman's mouth sucking on your neck. Trust me. So why don't we just get some molly for those girls we met before and turn this weekend into a freakend? You know that I love turning weekends into freakends, - but all of our money... It's in the ocean. - Yeah. And the people that owned these pants were super poor 'cause there's no money in my pants. - Stop. That's the top of my penis. - Do you have any money? Look, guys, we are on the beach in the most liberal state in the union. I'm pretty sure we can find some molly. - Where? - Yeah. Yeah, where?

No, no. No! No! Left hand, nipple. Well, this is absolute torture. I actually don't mind it. I grew up listening to my parents have sex a lot, so the noise is kind of soothing. - Sure. - Hey, guys. You know, I know this isn't the beach day we wanted, - but it's the beach day we got. - Yeah. Even though we don't have any weed, I do have a molly. - All right! - Cool. You guys want some? All right, let's split it. - You're taking it? - Why are you putting it in your mouth? - Yeah. - Okay. Damn it. Dude... And you know what's better than smoking weed out of a shell?

That is potent. - I'm feeling it. - I'm feeling it big-time. This is kicking in. I'm feeling it, dude. I just said that. Yeah, I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it, though. I'm feeling it so hard. I'm feeling it more harder than you guys. Look at the sunset. It's, like, jumping right out of the clouds at me. My God, Blake. Lam into that sunset so hard. - Yeah. - Even probably harder than you guys are. Yeah, for sure more than me, 'cause it's pretty overcast. Yeah, it is a little shitty-looking, admittedly. The only thing that would make it better... No clouds and a little hickey on my neck, but, well. Hey. You want me to give you a hickey, don't you? No, I don't, but thank you for offering. You're a sweet man. He wants me to give him a hickey, doesn't he? - I don't. - I'll give you a hickey. - I don't... - Whoa. - Just let me... - I don't want... - I'm good. I'm good. - It doesn't matter! Stop! Adam! I don't want it! Adam overboard. Are you filming? Tell me you got that. Um, no, I'm actually looking for Pokémon. I did find Charmander, though. Yes! The ecstasy's kicking in. Whoo-hoo! I felt that. Nice. Just let the current take you! Adam! It's an octopus! An octopus! - Adam! - Lot of kelp! Come on!
