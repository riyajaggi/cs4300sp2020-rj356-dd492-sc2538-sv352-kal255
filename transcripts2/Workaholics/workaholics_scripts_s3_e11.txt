You came at us so hard with all these popcorn... s. It was a joke, you bitch! - Whoa. Shots fired. - I'm in town to do a ride-along with the police, 'cause I'm writing a cop novel. - Cool. - Wow. - Gritty stuff. - I bet, dude. But Alice wanted me to stop by for the roast. - Roast? What roast? - Yeah. Oh, Monday is Bill's 20th anniversary of working at Telamericorp, so we're roasting him. - Cool. Yeah. - Oh, nice. All right, so, like, how many snaps should we write? Yeah, can we work blue? Can we cuss? And also, who's Bill? Oh, actually, Alice said you guys don't get to do the roast. - Really? - Uh, why wouldn't the three funniest guys in the office be roasting him? You're not funny. I'm not funny? Me? Adam, "The... The Laugh Ki... The Laugh... uh... Giver" Demamp. Mm-hmm. I know all 101 sick jokes for twisted kids. Oh, Alice, you want to know the difference between a pile of dead babies and a pile of sand? I don't eat sand. Fine. Whatever. - You'll let us roast? - Yes. Yes! Nice. - Yes. - So cool. I got this thing... Hey, you honestly don't think I'm funny? Just me, not talking about those guys. You've honestly never said one thing I have ever found at all funny, bro. What do you know about funny? Chicks aren't funny. Dudes are funny. Hangover 2 rules. Bridesmaids drools. I don't care what anybody says. We're the funniest people in this office. - Funnier than that dad. - I'm funnier than she is. Got a subscription to "Suicide Illustrated!" Wait. Now Bill is trying to get a snack? Bill! You still gonna end up eating what you always eat. Your big-ass boogers in your nose! Hey, you know, I see what you're doing, Bill. He's trying to make jokes about you, but it's, uh... it's "snot" funny. It... it is... it's snot funny. - Snot. - I said "snot," because the boogers... With the snot. - Hey, uh... - What the... Bill's so bald, right? He looks like he, uh... like he's a cancer patient! Death bed! This dude, um, he's a human... One time, I seen that motherfucker dookie in his drawers! Dookie! Dookie! ♪ dookie in your drawers, Bill, dookie in your draw... ♪ You know, maybe Montez is right. Maybe I'm not an hysterical dude. - Hey! - I won't listen to it. You are funny, okay? No one has given me more laughs in this world - than this guy. - Yeah. Adam "the laugh giver" Demamp. Yep. - Thank you. - I mean, sure, Montez has - broad appeal, right? - Sure. We'll give him that. But I'm sorry... I have a more refined, dry, British sense of humor, a la the funniest movie of all time, Austin Powers. - No. - Oh, please! Funniest movie of all time, no questions, Wayne's World One. No, sir. You guys like the big blockbusters. That's cool. That's fine. Me, personally... indie comedy. That's what I'm into. I'm talking about Indian comedy. Very, very, very hot right now. Love Guru? That's the future of comedy. You guys are out of your minds. I hope I'm not interrupting a circle jerk. - No, we were just... - We're not circle-jerking. Although this would be the room to do it in. Where the weed at? Bring it, baby. Bring it. - He's back. - Party beast. What are you dick gymnasts squawking about, anyway? Oh, man, I don't know. We just want to be the stars of the roast, but that Montez guy... - he has so many snaps. - Yeah. - 'tez is a cartoon character. - Mm-hmm. I don't find him funny. Yeah, I mean, t-these people... they're not gonna understand my party tricks. I've got party tricks. I have this one where I eat 60 ketchup packets, and then I don't vomit. I will tell you the secret to a good roast. Know your target, inside and out, - and then hit 'em where it hurts! - Whoa. - I thought he was gonna hit me. - He's right. Montez knows Bill way better than we do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but he knows work Bill. He doesn't know the real Bill, weekend Bill. We gotta get to know weekend Bill. Weekend Bill. We've gotta get to know weekend Bill. Wait, who's Bill, again? {pub}The reason Wayne's World works... - Guys, think I can touch this? - I know your mouth is moving, but it's weird that you're not saying anything. - I touched that. - It's about real dudes. Comedy is not about jokes. Did you guys see how I just touched that? - It's about shedding light... - It's like ten feet in the air. - And Austin Powers does that. - Here, shh! Here it is. - Come on. - Number eight. ♪ ♪ Holy yoga, dude! He's a yoga dude. Oh, we can destroy him. No one likes yoga dudes. ♪ Guru! ♪ Dude, it funny because, like, girls do yoga, and he's a guy, - and he's doing yoga. - Yeah, that is why it's funny. - Right? - Yeah, we're really finding, you know, the depth of the comedy. - We're really digging deep. - Right. What's he doing... Now, though? - Oh, my God. - Naked yoga. What? Oh, my God, he's a "naked yoga" guy. Wait, is he... God, he's sucking it. Yes! We're gonna skewer him with this! Ugh. You really think we can make fun of him for this? - Yeah. - Yeah. What are you talking about? This is amazing. He's like a superhero. We can't reveal his superpowers. I'm sorry. Does this not come across to you as just the gayest thing you've ever seen? I think it's gay not to sip your own tip. That means you don't like blow jobs that much, and that's, like, the gayest thing in the world. Right. Uh, guys, I think he's about to... okay, let's take a lap. Let's take a lap. Oh, God, he's in there. What's he doing? I know exactly what that is. It's medical cream for eczema, without a doubt. Okay, so he's a street performer with eczema. - This is... Sad. - This is great! We have so much good stuff for the roast. What? What's funny about unlimited self-blow jobs and getting paid to do the robot? Nothing. I'm jealous of this dude. We're coming up dry. We can't make fun of him for this. I'm not doing this again, dude. Just tell me what you want. Jesus Christ! Okay, fine, ham? Is that what you want? Oh, no, this is just depressing. Yeah, I'm sad too... Mostly hungry, actually. Yeah. Ders, go order a pizza. They don't serve pizza here. It's a sandwich place. Do you think they'll deliver pizza here, like, if we order from a pizza place? Do you have a punch card? You punched this yourself, didn't you? All right, you know what? Get out. We're done. Beat it. Don't take that sandwich! I will call the cops! Hey, hang on a second, hang on a second. I'll pay for his food. Look, he's... He's my dad, so I'm very embarrassed. I'm sure your dad's embarrassed you from time to time. No, he hasn't. He's... he has great judgment. He would never do something like this. You've been following me all day? Eh, since, like, 9:00 a.m. So you saw me...? Mm-hmm. Yes. You've gotta teach me how to do that. Believe me, you don't wanna go down that road. It's the only road I want to go down. Anyway, look, we're just looking for dirt on you, so we can beat Montez at roasting. I hate this stupid roast. I already know I'm a loser. I don't need the whole office telling me so. - You got a bunch of... - Montez is ruthless. - I don't even want to go. - Whoa, whoa, okay. That means we don't get to roast. Bill, what you're forgetting here is that... You're the guest of honor, right? - Yeah. - So you get the last word. We can take Montez down together. Yep. What about that dickhead Jet Set? You teach me how to... Myself, and we've got a deal. Well, you gotta be big. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Holy Moly. ♪ O'er the land-uh ♪ ♪ of the free-uh ♪ ♪ and that fucking Bill's gay-uh ♪ And I'm out. Have fun roasting this bald pig. Great job, Bradley! Who's Bradley? I'm Tony Clifton, you asshole. - Wake up! - Oh! Bill treat his nose like the hometown buffet! What's the worst job in the world? Being Bill's pants, 'cause you know you're gonna get dookied on! He has a booger pasta bar, a booger dessert bar, a booger serving station... Yes, Bill, you look like a goddamn child molester. Bill be picking his boogers like he Orville Redenbacher. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop! I got three words for you, brother. Wash your stinkin' ass! Okay, our next roasters wanted to do it as a threesome. And they also wanted to perform together. All right, let's give it up for Adam, Anders, and Blake! - Whoo! - Shagadelic! Do I make you Randy, baby? Shwing! Tickle, tickle, break the pickle. Excellent. We were listening out there, you know, and you guys were roasting Bill pretty hard. And he's my mate, so I'm here to tell you to behave, baby, yeah! All right. We're not worthy of such a great co-worker. We're not worthy! We're not worthy! I got it. Mariska Hargitay. Mari-ska Hargitay! Y'all stop! Tickle, tickle, break the pickle. You already did this. - Hey, come on. - Ow! That hurt my ankle. Have you guys really not seen Love Guru? It's a funny, funny movie. - Mike Myers is in it. - Yeah, Wayne's World One. It's, like, one of the biggest comedies - of, like, the early mid-2000s. - All right, all right, look. We're sorry you don't like our characters, but we're funny guys. And we followed Bill this weekend. And guess what he does on the weekend? He paints himself silver like a robot and goes on the street and begs for money. And then... and then we also caught him stealing a sandwich, because he's that poor, guys. This isn't what we planned. What are you doing? It's all true. It's all true. We followed him. And guess what we saw? We saw this broke-ass fool suck his own dick! What? - He's good at it. - That's hilarious. Enough! You guys said you were on my side! - Sure, whatever, man. - They love it, man. You're right. My life is a joke. But I have news for you! Oh! This is where the joke ends! {pub}- Okay. All right. - Oh, God! Oh, God! All right, everybody in the corner! Let's go! Let's go! Cell phones in here! I don't want anyone ruining my big day! Hey, Bill, what are you doing? Okay, please, just put the gun down. You heard the lady. Put it down. Or what? You're making a big mistake, man. Don't do something you're gonna regret, man. Something I regret? I regret my entire life! What? A good-looking guy like yourself? No, no, no! Please don't kill me! I wish this was all a dream! Doodle-ooh, doodle-ooh, doodle-ooh. Stop, stop, I got this. Look, okay... Bill, if anyone knows what it's like to be picked on, it's me. My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. Shut up and help me lock this place down, - Mr. Powers. - Okay, all right. Okay, his back's turned. Let's do this. - Do what? - Roll on him! Grab the gun and bring him to justice. Get my reward. Don't... oh, don't be stupid. Too late. Welcome to staples center... Bitch. Aah! - Oh, gosh! - Come with me! Now! Good-bye... Forever. Adam. Turn around! - They bought it, right? - Oh, totally! Oh, I'm sorry I did the stapler thing. I just felt... I really felt like that was in the moment, - you know? - No, no, that was good. It sold it. It was hilarious. - It did sell it, right? - Yeah! I was feeling it! It was incredible. Ders and Blake did a good job too. Like, we can't forget about them. You did great! Okay, so what's next? All right, everybody just be calm. Adam's probably in there telling Bill to turn himself in. It's gonna be over soon. - Oh, my God! - Oh, God. What have you done? Anyone else wanna be a hero? You need help, man. Bill, let us help you. - You want to help me? - Yes, Bill. Maybe you should have thought of that before you said I ate my boogers! Bill, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. - It was a roast. - Then show me you're sorry. I want you to pick every nose here and eat it, one by one! What? Come on, Bill. Dude, eat their boogers! He's not messing around. He just killed Adam. Bill, sir, if Montez does what you say, will you let us all live? He eats every booger, and I'll consider it. Okay. Why don't you start with Waymond? He looks a little stuffy. Come on, Bill. Put the gun down, Bill. Montez, save a life. Eat a booger. I'm sorry, Waymond. I can't... ugh. Oh. Oh, God, he's eating it. Oh, I can't... you know what would make this perfect? If Jet shits his pants... - Hell, no! - While you're digging for gold. Everybody wins! Bill, no! Don't make him do it. Never question my authority, unless you want everyone to die. Let me do it for him. I'll shit my pants right now! - Whoa, uh, no, J-Jillian... - Okay. Just let him handle his thing. Thank you, though. - No, I have it in me right now. - You're very brave. Think about what you doing right now, Bill. Stop this. I am thinking! Do it! Oh, God. I can't. I can't. I can't. Eat it! I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Okay, everyone, I have an announcement! - This whole thing... - Bill, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Uh, before you make that announcement, you had something else you wanted to say, remember? You wanted Ders here to admit that Wayne's World is a better movie than Austin Powers, or he'll kill him! - I did? - Yes, you did. Okay, sure, uh... Say what Blake said, or I'll kill you! Yeah. Well, then I guess you're gonna have to kill me, because that's a goddamn lie, and I don't lie. I will admit that it blows Love Guru out of the water. Wayne's World is better than Love Guru. - I'll say that. - Well, obviously. That's really not saying anything, okay? Because Wayne's World is better than Austin Powers - and Love Guru combined. - Oh-ho! - It has the funniest lines! - You know what? I feel like I'm surrounded by freakin' idiots. - No way. Way! - Shh! Shh! - No way. Way! - Shh! Camera one, camera two. Camera one, camera two. - Stop! Sto... - Praise Buddha. I am reincarnated. I am once again the Love Guru! What in the fuck? I can't believe you would talk trash on another man's comedy when he's not even in the room... very Wayne move of you. - Bill, shoot Wayne in the face. - I wouldn't even call your movie a comedy, really. - Justin Timberlake? - Oh, my God. That man is a quadruple threat. - He's a singer. - He is so... so many threats. He's not a comedic actor. He's a dancer. I'm threatened by so many... - on the floor, now! - Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! - It was a mistake! - It was a joke! It was a joke! {pub}- Don't move! - No, no, no, no, no, no! This is all just a misunderstanding. Alright? We're just trying to be funny, but guys, this one was not as funny as we thought it was. That's right. It wasn't very at all. But this is... It was a joke, you bitch! What the fug? These guys are my SWAT army. Thanks guys, worked like a charm. Good luck on your book, B-rad. Sounds like some real gritty stuff. I know, I'm running it! Bill called me last night to make sure your little performance didn't get him into any trouble. I'm sorry. - You're such a loser. - Wow, OK Bill. And you know what's weird? As I seem to remember someone saying: "Chicks aren't funny". God, I love you. Hold up, hold up, hold up. None of this was funny at all. You'd have me eat Jet Set's boogers. Now, is that anything? And this poor bastard got dookie in his pants. I don't mind. Plus, this was a good cause. Congratulations, Bill. I gotta go. Can't stand all that mess on me. Good night, my dudes. Good night, babe.
