 My mom puts on a happy face, but it's also a face of anguish, resentment and anger. She says to me, "This will always be your home. You can come whenever you want. You don't need to ring the bell or let me know. Come whenever you want, this is your home, and when Dad and I are gone, this will be your home and your brother's." She says it as if they were going to die the next day. I go, "Thanks, Mom." "Oh, don't thank me, enjoy this house. I can't enjoy it anymore. I'm reaching the end of my road. Enjoy, you're in the middle of yours."

 Time for music. This is Life in the Middle. We'll be here until 7:00 p.m. All right! - Your ear, let me pull your ear! - Has Pilar arrived? - Is Pilar here? - What does it look like? - Is Pilar here? - No, she isn't. - What do you want? - I'm bored. Well, it's my job. You wanted to come. - You made me come. - Life isn't all about having fun. Let's go, fake punching. - Dad! - Stop. - Wait. - Dad, you hit him! - Just look at Facundo! - Stop it, I didn't mean to. - His cheek! - I didn't mean to.

 But, Dad, he's crying! - Give him the iPad. - I'm not giving him the iPad. - Don't be a baby. - I'm not a baby, it's mine. - What's that? Here you go. - Come on, Dad, the iPad is mine! - I mean it. - Don't cry. - You hit him. You buy him an iPad. - What a nice welcome. - What happened, Sebastián? - My iPad! - Honey, what happened? - Everyone, calm down. - What's wrong? - First... - He hit me. - What? I want to show you the pictures, we had a great time all afternoon. - You don't need to. - Look what I brought! Uncle Shade, yay! - Well... - No, Facundo. You don't hit your father. I'll get mad. Now I'll keep it. - I'll keep it. - No. - Okay, give Dad a hug. - No. - Give your dad a kiss. - A hug? - We're going on air. - Coming. - See you later. - Okay, we'll talk. Great, bye. - Let's go. - Dad hit him. Yes, he punched me. - Really? - Yes. - Come on. - Put on a song. - Go to music. - Okay, put on a song. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES RADIO URBANA FM 198.2 ON AIR ALMOST HAPPY ON AIR Today's show was great. Thanks to all who listened... 4. "A MESSAGE FOR MY DAD" ...to everyone that wrote to us, that called us, that praised us, that insulted us, to all of you, thank you very much. Good afternoon, good evening and thank you very much. - Nice. - I didn't like the show. We did great on social media. We got loads of WhatsApp texts. So, Felipe, what do you think? - Felipe. - What? How do you think it went? - Same as always. - See? There's an Erica Montalvo outside. - From your high school, or elementary. - Erica Montalvo, yes. What does she want? - To speak with you. Should I bring her in? - No. Don't bring her in. - Excuse me. Hi! - Erica! - Sebi! - How are you doing, Erica? I'm so glad you're here. Great, this is great. You're... Erica and I were close friends. Yes, I was his closest female friend, his only woman friend. Back then, he had issues connecting with women. Same as now. He still has issues. My dad is turning 70. It occurred to me you could come to the party and do one of your monologues. My dad really admires you. And besides, you're the only one of my classmates he remembers. He laughs whenever he listens to you on the radio - or whenever he watches you on TV. - Sure. And he always says, "Look at him! Look at him. When he was little, he was so shy, and now he's..." - You'll get mad, I won't say it. - No. "A dumbass," he sometimes says. Okay, here's the deal. It's going to sound like I'm being cocky, but I'm not. I don't do those kinds of events anymore, you know? It doesn't help you or me. It doesn't help anybody. - Understand? - Yes. I see how I could think you were being cocky. I heard you might be. Anyway, it doesn't matter. - Who told you that? - No, just rumors. You know, when a rumor gets out there, it gets out there, but no... I'm not cocky. Am I? A little bit. Felipe? Hey, is he being cocky? I only see him here. When's the party? Saturday. It would be really important if you came. My dad had a slight health problem. He died. - He died? - For twenty-three seconds. - He was technically dead. - And now he's alive? - Yes, I'm inviting you to his birthday. - Sure. He admires you so much. And it would mean so much to me. I'll do anything you want, anything. You can ask me anything, I'll do it. Let me think about it. But, most probably yes. - How are your parents? - Fine. - Are they alive? - Yes. I'm so glad. Just think, if you could give them a huge present, wouldn't you? Especially now, while they're still here with us. Someday, suddenly, they will be gone. Suddenly you call them on the phone and, boom! They're gone. I'm telling you this because it happened to me. I went to visit Daddy not long ago, opened the door and he was lying there in the living room. Don't ever keep anything to yourself, Sebi. Are you going to see your dad? Tell him you really love him. If you see your mom, give her a big hug. Hello. Dad? Mom? Hello. Hello. No. You should've let us know you were coming! I did. I said I'd drop by after the show. - Well, ring the bell, knock at the door! - I rang the bell, I knocked at the door. Well, we didn't hear you. We were focused on what we were doing. But I didn't want to see what you were doing. What's the matter? Can't your parents have sex? Yes, you can, I just don't want to see it. - Be honest. We gross you out. - Yes, you gross me out. You really gross me out. I hope you can get laid at my age. I hope! I hope so. But I hope no one sees me. But it could happen. It already happened. That's it. It's over. - You're an idiot! That's what you are. - Don't call him that. No! I mean you! I told you that he was coming here right after the show. Please. - Don't touch me, Mom. - Okay, fine. Sorry. Did you know your mom saw you doing the same thing with Pilar? - Stop it, Dad. Cut it out. - Are you stupid? Now he will never trust me again. That's it, I'm leaving. That way I can pretend I didn't see anything. Aren't you staying for dinner? I made roast and potatoes. - Maybe some other time. - You should be happy. You know your parents love each other. I never once saw my dad even caressing my mother, and you witnessed our love. I would've given anything to see my dad screwing my mom. - Bye. - The things you say! Yes, I felt bad, you know? I don't like it when the kids leave the station in tears. It's done. They forgot about it, Sebastián. I wanted to tell you something else. Something... weird happened. What happened? - I saw my parents having sex. - Huh? - I saw my parents having sex. - No! Unbelievable. How did it happen? Well, I went home and saw them. I couldn't find them. - I thought they may be dead. - And they were very much alive. No, I would've preferred they were dead. Tell me, what position were they in? - You're so filthy! - No, if you tell me this, I need details. From behind. I can't believe it. I don't think it's funny. It hit me the wrong way. Made me think they have more sex than me. You're laughing because you know it's true. The kids also caught us once. But they didn't realize it. No, they didn't. Well, you have one hell of a subject to talk about in therapy. You saw your parents having sex. I've got to go, Seba. I need to study. Go ahead. I have a ton of things to do. Catch you later. Okay, Erica, if I go to your dad's birthday party... and do the monologue, what's your budget for something like that? Sorry, I can't help it. This is one of Sebi's jokes. No. - It's not? - No. What? You want to charge me for going to my dad's birthday? No, I wouldn't charge you for going to your dad's party. I'd charge for doing a monologue. Doing monologues is my job. Oh, I was wrong. I was wrong. Because I let myself be led on by my childhood friend. I let myself be led on by my school buddy. But, above all, do you want to know what led me on? The guy I listen to on the radio. Oh, I'm such a fool. I'm so stupid. I never learn. Money makes the world go round, it's all about the cash. - Erica, you'll never learn. - Stop it, Erica, wait. Let's talk, stop. And I held you in the highest regard. And then you mention the word "budget." - Forget it. - Budget, he says! Sebas doesn't know what he's saying. Sometimes he gets greedy. Right? Very greedy. Forget it. He'll go to the wedding. He'll do the monologue... It's not a wedding! It's my dad's birthday! Exactly! And he'll forget about the budget, right? - Forget about it. - I want him to come. Yes, he'll come. Forget about it. Sometimes it goes to his head, I don't know. Anything else you need? Whatever you need... Done, I calmed her down. Hey, she wants another favor. - What? - A message from Tano Frosati, the ex-soccer player. - I know who he is. - The old man's idol. I'm the old man's idol. No, you are loved very much, but the idol is Tano Frosati. Okay, then try to make it happen. You're the celebrity, Seba. He'll never give it to me. Or is it true that you're being cocky? Tano charges 3,500 pesos for a two-minute greeting, plus 500 pesos for the camera and editing. - Right, yes. - Okay? Excellent. Sebastián can't wait to see Tano Frosati. - Perfect. Bye. - Bye. - Done. - I'm not going. - Come in. Welcome. - Thank you very much. This is the Marshall, Tano's most precious jewel. Bro-nie, guys. Thanks, Gise. I must tell you, this means the world to me. My dad thinks Tano's the best. - I understand, people love Tano. - Yes, he was great. He is great, Seba. - He still is. - He's still in full force! You know, we can't even go out for a walk without people recognizing him right away, asking him for a picture. It must be quite normal for you, right? You grew up with a famous dad. It's like... He's my boyfriend. Tano is a man. Probably more man than some men my age. I'm sure. I'm sure Tano will be here soon. Want a bro-nie, guys? - I think it's "brownie." - What? To me, it's "brownie," not "bro-nie." Guys. - Tano! - Tano. - No, it's okay. - Hi, Tano. Oh, Tano, darling. My daddy has talked about you so much. You are... his idol. I understand. You don't find players like me anymore. I'd score a goal and kiss my jersey because I really felt it. Now they change clubs like they change their underwear. They change wives. Why wouldn't they change clubs? I was with the same woman all my life. And when Mónica left us... - She was so pretty. - Beautiful. - She is. - But she's dead? I'm sure she is looking down at us from someplace. I thought I'd never be with another woman. I feel Mónica sent me Gisela. Gisela has Mónica's spirit, and now I'm with her. And I really am. I never cheated on her. - Ever. - And I never will. Today everybody's screwing everybody. Drugs, homosexuality, AIDS. We have lost our values. Okay, shall we get started? - Don't touch me. - Come on, the place looks lovely. The place is crap. Yes, it's second-rate, but there are young people. - It'll be good for you to... - It's his 70th birthday... Hi. Jimenita, my little sister. Remember? Yes! Just look at you! - Hey! What's up? - How are you? - How are you? - What are you doing here? - Great and you? - We follow each other on Instagram. - That's crazy. Really? - Your sister does some fun stuff. Thanks. - Yes, your son also does fun stuff. - My son? He's my producer. You always tell the same joke! - I could be. - It's fine, don't worry about it. I want a word with Sebi in private, if you don't mind. No, the four of us should talk. - No, I want to be alone with you. - No, go ahead. Shall we? I'll go check out the place with her. I'll catch up with you later. Okay, Sebi, let's define the steps we should follow. I'll go out, introduce you, you do your monologue, and then you present Tano Frosati's video. - Okay? - Perfect, let's do it. Does your dad know I'm coming? - No, he doesn't, it's a surprise. - Of course. - Only Aunt Ester knows. - All right. Okay. Are you nervous? - Frankly, I am. I never do this. - I'm really nervous. I really appreciate it, I mean it. After all that he's been through, you can imagine that this is like coming back to life. - Okay. - I am moved by your gesture of coming here and sharing this. Okay. THANKS FOR YOUR LOVE AND JOY WE LOVE YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY BIRTHDAY Hi! Hope everything is great. And this special night continues! Daddy, here's a surprise for you. I am honored to present... He was kind of shy when he was a kid, maybe you'll remember, but he isn't anymore. He's famous now! Everyone, presenting Sebastián! Okay. Happy birthday, Julio Montalvo. I'm so happy. Well, I can't see anything, but I'm sure you're out there, Julio. I was so moved by the video we just watched. It was so great. Let's take a couple of hits and then head back. - Seba gets kind of... - Yes. If I'm not there... If I'm not there, he kind of crumbles. - Really? - I'm kind of his... his pillar, he calls me. His pillar? Maybe someday I'll turn 70. Good thing I'll already be bald. ...but very short jokes. Like, "Say hi to the little dotted cubes. Are they nice?" "That's dice." I could never be a runner because you can't carry anything. You can't have anything on you. They go running, wearing those fluorescent clothes that are skintight and they can't carry... Fine, don't take your phone, don't take your wallet, but your keys? Where do they keep the keys? I ask, "Where are your keys?" He says, "I only brought my car keys." "Where do you carry your car keys?" This guy asks, "Okay, man, what do you mean we're going to... ...giant baby, you know? A whole other thing. Frankly, being a giant baby makes me feel better, more valued, more loved, more accepted by society. In fact, the other day, the people from the Save Both Lives Foundation took out a parade float that looked just like me... And I felt so valued, so loved. Again! It's the same thing every party, you pig! - We were just coming out. - We'll be right there. Thank you so much, Julio! Happy birthday. May there be 70 more! Good night and thank you all. Daddy, did you like it? - I don't know who he is. - It's Sebi! Sebi, Sebastián. But he isn't the main attraction tonight. No. Julio, tonight's highlight is someone whom you love dearly and who recorded the following message for you. Julito Montalvo, here's a big hug and a happy birthday to you. Roberto, here. Tano Frosati. Frosati! Our generation did great things for this country. I did it with the goals I scored, but most of all with the loyalty to my team. You surely did it through your work and your family. - Happy birthday to a great man. - A doctor, please! A doctor, damn it! We need a doctor! - Daddy? - Hey, Julio! What's wrong, Julio? INSTITUTE OF PHTHISIOPNEUMOLOGY Doctor Rosario Vargas, you have a phone call in your office. What happens in the next few hours is critical. He had a stroke with all the excitement and, well, his recent medical history. Is he going to make it? His progress in the coming hours is key. All right, I'll be here if you need me for anything, okay? Thanks. - He's such an angel. - Yes. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be, he's not dead. You should've told us the video was this emotional. Well, I told him... it would've been good to warn about that. - Didn't I tell you? - TV kills these idiots' brain cells! - Well. - Okay, let's be on the same page. Jime, stay here with Aunt Ester, okay? - We should take turns. - Okay. I'll go home and take a shower. - Do you want me to stay with you? - Oh. Yes, thanks. - Sebi. - Yes? Will you take me home? - Thank you so much for what you did today. - No, it's okay. You were great. I mean it. - I got the sense nobody laughed. - You're crazy, Sebi. You can drop me off here. Okay. Too bad it ended this way. It was always a possibility. My daddy's sick and old. But I don't regret anything. It was the right thing to do, celebrating his birthday. One should take the risk. I really like to take risks. Unfasten your seat belt. Relax, Sebi. Unfasten your seat belt. There's a problem. What's wrong, Sebi? I didn't bring protection. I always carry protection. I always have a condom. Here. Oh, thanks. - It slipped away. - Here's one. There. Unbuckle your belt. Hello? Auntie. At what time was it? All my love. I'm so sorry. They're asleep. - I wanted to see the kids. - I know, but they fell asleep. - All right, come. - Okay. - At least you can watch them sleep. - It's not the same. It's more fun seeing them up. How did it go at your friend's birthday party? Her dad's party. And she isn't my friend, she's an old classmate. - How did it go? - Fine, I don't know. Come. See? It was simple. You got paid and and now you are here. Yes, I know. Cute, aren't they? - When they're asleep. - When they're asleep. Do you want to spend the night? There's the sofa bed downstairs. No, it's okay. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. What do you do with your keys? You're always losing them! I thought I could come sleep at your place. Come, Sebi. Of course, I'll wait up for you. This will always be your home. Hi, darling! - Hi, Mom, how are you? - Hi, you look so tired. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
