 No! No, look... Can we do it right now? A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES RADIO URBANA FM 198.2 ON AIR ALMOST HAPPY Not too bad, but you're not breathing properly. You run out of breath. It's normal at your age, but given your profession, sit, you should have more air. Of course. And what should I do? First, do breathing exercises. And don't make a fool out of yourself. I saw you last night

 Tell me, Sebastián, do you prefer doing theater, radio or writing? To be honest, sometimes I fantasize and try to rank them. Frankly, everything jerks off. You mean "levels off"? - Yes. - You said "jerk offs." No. I said "jerks off"? - Is it a joke? - No. - Then it's a Freudian slip. - Well... Someone with so many years of psychoanalysis, right? No, I meant "levels off." - But you said "jerk offs." - We can cut this out, can we? My kids kept asking what I was laughing about. I couldn't stop laughing. It was spectacular! Yeah, but... They really blew it out of proportion. But it all came out so naturally. So spontaneously. I guess you just blurted it out. Though I can't believe what happened next. This is good material for therapy, right? For this week's session. - I'm not in therapy. - You got yourself discharged? No, my psychologist died. Oh, are you joking? I can't tell when you're being serious or when you're telling the truth. I called him, someone picked up and told me he was dead. Okay. First, let me ask you, are you tired, are you stressed, have you lost your sexual drive? Don't worry. More Sex is here. More Sex brings back your sexual drive, your enjoyment with your couple or couples. Don't believe me? Watch. More Sex, intimate lubricant gel. Increase the pleasure. Of course, you're taking a More Sex goodie bag. - Thanks. - Do you have someone to use it with or are you single as we've read on some sites? Well, I'm single, but there's always... - There's something, right? A prospect. - I'm single. - Something you don't want to tell us. - I'm single. - Okay. Thanks for coming. - And you? Are you single? I'm swamped with work. No, turn it off, it's embarrassing. - Is it true your psychologist died? - Yes, he died. Terrible. I thought, "Poor guy, he's having such a hard time." And, at the same time, you don't know how I enjoy it whenever you do. I'm Cecilia Ferrari. - Cecilia Ferrari! - Yes. - No, girl. - Yes, man. No! Chechu! - What's up? How are you, dude? - I didn't recognize you. I can't believe it! I'm the one who can't believe it. What have you become? - You're famous now. - Well, you're a doctor. Someone learned something in that school. Last night I saw you on TV and now you're here. Yes. I tell my kids all about you. - They know everything. - Really? My husband too. He always tells me, "Enough, Cecilia, enough. It's been 25 years, get over it." And I tell him, "You don't know how that son of a bitch made me suffer." - Yes. We were teenagers. - Yes. - Yes. I never apologized. - We were fifteen. Yes, looking back, I feel shame. That's the word! "Shame." I remember they asked you, "Hey, Seba... are you dating the fatty?" And you said, "No." - Such an asshole. - Yes, an asshole. I was in love with you. I know you were in love with me. - Well. - I could feel it. Now I'm saying I'm sorry. But I was fat. Okay, take this every 8 hours. But only... if you have a soar throat, jerk off. How many kids do you have? - Four. - Four? - Yes. - Wow... I have twins. Yes, you've said it on the radio. - You're separated, you have twins. - Yes. - Yes, I tell everything. - Uh-huh. I should tell less. - Yes, you really should. - I don't know why. The light turns on and I just talk. You love it. Yes, in real life, talking is hard for me, so I speak on the... It's a cliche. Well. So are you married? Are you still married? Yes, to my kids' father. - I don't know him, do I? - No. Not even I know him. - Can't I tell I joke? Only you can? - No, it's fine. I didn't say anything. You just stare at me, as the joke professional. No. - I'm shocked. - You're shocked? - Yes... - To see me thin. No, of the fact I didn't recognize you, of us meeting again. Don't pretend you're sentimental, you never came to our high school reunions. - I don't like those parties. - They're lame. The high school reunion, the famous... - That's not it. I don't like parties. - Of course. - I prefer one on one. - So, one on one, let's go for drinks. - Great, whenever you want. - Now. - Now? - Yes. - Okay. - Do you want to? Yes, do you? Mirta, I'm going out for an hour. - Wait a sec. - Sure. AT LAST YOU ANSWER! I'M AT THE KIDS' SCHOOL. THEY CALLED TO SAY THEY'RE NOT WELL. BOTH? BOTH. I'M TEN BLOCKS AWAY. I'M ON MY WAY. You know what? There's a problem with my kids at school. I'm really sorry. Bye. - Hi. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I took care of it. - But what happened? Nothing, they were driving them crazy, They were bullying them. They both started crying. - Why were they bullying them? - Were you on a TV show last night? Yes. And you said you're a jerk off? No, I didn't. It was a slip of the tongue. Well, that's why they were being bullied. Everyone in school telling them their dad is a jerk off and everything. But anyway, I fixed it. The principal is talking with the kids. Problem solved. I meant to say "levels off" and said "jerk offs." - I don't understand why... - Why you got them mixed up? No, why do elementary school kids - know what "jerk off" means? - "Jerk off." - They're 10. - Want to come buy some stuff? I tell you I'm worried about our kids' education, - and you...? - Vegetables, let's go. - The kids don't eat vegetables. - Not at your place. Must I repeat everything to you? It's just a weird question. No, it isn't weird. I asked if you talk with our kids. I do talk. Why wouldn't I talk? I feel they should know you're famous, that you're exposed to this situation, that a site can write about you saying you're a jerk off, so... - Hush? What? - Don't say "jerk off." You don't say "jerk off" on TV! Hi, two pounds of carrots, please. And one of bananas. They know I'm exposed. - Of course they know. - Fine, but... I don't know, I feel you should talk to them more. Sorry. I mean it. I mean, tell them whether you like being famous or not, ask them if they like it or not. Well, the same old story. Talk a bit more. - How do you know I don't talk? I do. - Talk and listen... - and a bit more. - I talk and I listen. Thanks. Do you want something to drink? I don't understand why you get defensive. Instead of listening to what I have to say, the first thing you do... - That's not true. - Yes, it is. I always listen to you. You said I should speak with the kids more. I believe I do, but if you think I don't... Yes, I mean, talk more in general. I don't know, for instance, how are you coping with the separation? You expect me to tell you how I am after I separated from you? Why do you repeat the questions? - I don't get it. - What you ask is weird. - You want me to tell you...? - What's weird? - I think it's weird. - You're my kids' father. I want you to do well. I want you well. I want to know how you're doing, that's all. I'm fine. At first, it was hard, but I'm adjusting. You're unbelievable. - Why? - It's a made-up phrase. You're just acting. You turn solemn, serious. I'm fine. I was afraid the kids would suffer, but to be honest, they seem to be great. Yes, they seem great to me too. But you need to talk with them more. I like eating at the park. If you go to a café, you have to walk in, ask for a table, be spotted by the waiter, they bring the menu, the bill, your food before that. They pour your soda. I hate it when they pour it. After asking for the bill, you have to pay. If it's with a card, you have to sign. You can't leave, you're a prisoner. Here, we come, we sit whenever we want, we eat whatever we want, we leave whenever we want. You're so antisocial. - On the contrary. It's a park. - I like that you like it. I like it, it's really nice. I want to know if you have a girlfriend. - No, don't laugh. - I'm not laughing. Yes, you laughed. - Well, I smiled. - Okay, I want to know who... my kids' father is dating. I want to know who they're sharing... I'm not dating anyone. Neither am I. Okay. When I finally do, I'll tell you. In fact, I had something. Nothing important, but it was something. Hear this out... - It's small, isn't it? - What? Don't act surprised, I know it's small. I think it's normal. I do my best, but I know it's tiny. I was bullied at school, at the club, everywhere. I bought medicine, stuff they sell online. But I don't know, it didn't work. Normal, it seems normal to me. Well, obviously, we just finished and it's small, but that's normal. It's tiny. - I don't know. - Don't torture yourself. It's pretty... normal. I don't have that much experience, but... it's normal. I can't be have such bad luck. The first guy I fuck after separating, and it's... I swear, Sebastián... I couldn't... It was... I couldn't believe it! I thought, "Sebastián, for God's sake, come back!" That's what I miss. To finish fucking and, naturally, keep on doing our own thing. There's no need to talk or anything. And the size too, right? Don't brag. What happens to you when you have casual sex? You can't ask me that. Why can't I ask? Are we diplomats? Do we have to keep our distance? It's a bit invasive, isn't it? - I told you. - I didn't ask you to. Okay. Well, what I always look for... is where to throw away the condom. I think, "What have I done? Why did I do this?" I go to the bathroom with my ass exposed to throw away the condom. And the girl looks at my ass from behind... You tell me what you do after having sex but not what's going on with you. You tell me what you do after having sex but not how you feel. Okay, here we are. Thanks for coming with me. No, please. It's killing me. - Let me. - Okay. - All right. - Do you want to stay and have a drink? - Okay. - Okay. - Let me go to the bathroom. - Right. Number one or number two? - Number one. - Okay, lift the seat. When you're done, put it back down. - Are you okay? - Yes! - What were you doing? - Huh? - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. It seems to me... Don't tell me you were comparing it - to the bottle. - No. Why would I do that? Are you crazy? Really? You were comparing it to this. - No. - Though... There's no need to worry... I was always quite satisfied with your size. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I'll be right there. Wait. He sold me rotten spinach! I'm never going back. Did I tell you? I'm going back to my singing lessons. That's great. Yes, I met a great teacher. That's great. I'm so glad you're starting. Yes. And I want to start a major on literature, but seriously. I mean, I'm sick of the literature course or the book clubs. - I mean it, I want to study, I'm... - Of course. - Why don't you go with Rocha? - Huh? Jesús Rocha, the writer and lecturer that was at the show a couple of times. Oh, right. No, no thanks. - Why? - I don't know. He thinks he's deep and I think he drowns in superficiality. Besides... Jesús Rocha? With that name, nothing he says can be interesting. You're being a bit prejudiced, aren't you? But Jesús? His name had to be Jesús? - I didn't name him. - I want to escape from it - and it follows me. - Oh, right. - That's what it is. - Do you want to stay for lunch? - I can't. - Isn't the show much later? - Yes, but I have things to do. - Can you talk? Maybe I don't want to tell you what it is I have to do. Great, then tell me, "I don't want to tell you what it is I have to do." Maybe I don't want to tell you I don't want to tell you. You bend over backwards not to talk, it's unbelievable. CECILIA FERRARI - Hi, Mom, how are you? - Just hanging, Sebi. What's up? Nothing's up, Mom. Remember Cecilia Ferrari? Yes, the fat girl. Don't call her that, Mom. Well, she was fat. What do you want me to call her? Okay, but you shouldn't call her that. Okay, listen. Do you have pictures of back then? You took home all your teenage pictures. I don't know, I'd have to check. - Where did you run into her? - She's a doctor, she did my test. Test for what? - What's wrong? - Nothing, a routine checkup. - She was the doctor. - No, don't lie to me, Sebastián, not when it comes to health. Don't be stupid, darling. Don't insult me, Mom. Don't lie to me about your health and I won't insult you. - I don't lie to you. - You hide things from me too. You were on TV, and a friend told me you said "jerk off." What's going on with you? ON AIR I want to say hi to everyone who called me a "jerk off" today in the street. People behind the wheel, truck drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers. You all called me a jerk off, so I want to tell each of you that I heard you, I got it, I appreciate it. That's on the one hand. On the other hand, I want to talk about the past, which comes back to our life once in a while in different ways. Sometimes with a scent, a deodorant, a perfume. And sometimes the past creeps in as hard as it can... through a person. Cecilia Ferrari, thanks for being here. - No, thank you. - Please. I'm so nervous. Today, I went to some doctor's office, and Cecilia turned out to be the doctor. She ran tests on me and then confessed we had dated, she and I had dated, when we were 15. I hadn't recognized Cecilia, she's really changed. And, after hearing that, she told me a story I want her to tell us here, on the show. Luckily, Cecilia agreed to do it and now she's at the studio to tell what she has to tell. Okay, I hope I can tell it well. Sebastián and I dated when we were 15. We were so in love. So... in love. But... secretly. We were together, but didn't tell anyone. Yes... it was a secret. Because I was fat. And... He would've been teased... if they found out he had a fat girlfriend. So he decided not to tell. I understood. I knew where it was coming from. And I accepted it because I wanted a boyfriend. I even thought it was romantic, right? Having a secret romance. Until the story started to get more and more boring. As time went by, we had... less places to go. Less people to meet. Less to talk about. So it started to... dissolve, dissolve and dissolve. I got mad many years later. When I realized how unfair it had all been. So unfair. And now I see him, I listen to him... Well, I don't "see him." I listen to him on the radio, I saw him on TV saying... "jerk off." And he came to my office, I did his checkup and was able to tell him. After 30 years, after almost 30 years, I was able to tell him. And... And today I'm here... at the studio, to tell him... so it stops being a secret. It's not a secret anymore. You're free. You set me free. And I'm, sure you freed a large part of the audience that has gone through a moment like this or is going through a moment like this. That's why your testimony is so valuable, Cecilia. I really appreciate you coming, I mean it. - Thank you. - Please, thanks. - Hey! - Huh? Put on a song, go on. The show was lovely today. A lot of repercussion in all the social media. Yes, it was really exciting. - Everyone called me. It was great. - Yeah. - Yes, it was so exciting. - Yes. - Very exciting. - We don't have these types of shows, - Seba has a hard time being sentimental. - I don't. - Yes you do. - I don't. - A little bit. - When was the last time you cried? - I can't remember, but... - Hey, do you have a smoke? - No, why would I? - Let's go then. - Bye, guys, see you tomorrow. - Why, don't you have any? - I smoked it earlier. - They're really something. - Yes, they are. - Yes. Okay, thanks for coming. - Thanks for inviting me. - Please. - It was good, wasn't it? - Yes, really good. Come back whenever you want. Okay, great, I'll let you know. Hey, while you were on air, it occurred to me. You were so great, spoke so clearly. You can do a medicine section once a week. - No. - Yes! Well, I'm glad you invited me, I loved coming, but, well, it's not my thing. Thanks. - Do you want to go for drinks? - No. Some other day. I'm asking because I have spare time... No, I don't have spare time. To be honest, I want to go have a drink with you. I saw you today and... I had so many feelings that I hadn't had in a while. I don't know. Something happened to me and I don't know what it is. First, I felt it was melancholy, nostalgia. Infatuation. You'll think, "You've seen me one day and now you're in love?" Yes, one day and I fell in love. I felt all kinds of things, I don't know. - Forgive me for being this open, but... - No, I know, I'm nervous. I have to say things more, and I want to say them to you, I'm saying them to you. That's why invited you for drinks. - Yes. - We can go out many times, see what happens. I won't deny... that since I saw you, it stirred up all kinds of feelings, it's true. It stirred up all kinds of feelings. It's as if time hadn't gone by. But it did. And... At the same time, I feel... this strong connection between us. It's as if, I don't know, as if something came alive. It's crazy. Something that didn't die. Well... I was going to say I'd call you, but no. - WhatsApp. - Sure. Okay. Thanks for coming. - I really appreciate it. - Well, me too. My husband. Love! Luna, I'll introduce you. - They want to meet Sebastián. - Hi. Santino. What's up? Mateo, Lucas. How are you, kids? - And this is Germán, my husband. - How are you, Germán? Sebastián. It's a pleasure. - Okay. - Well, now you've met him. Let's go. Luna... My darling. My mom has told me so much about you. - Your mom told me about you. - She told me you're famous, but when you were little, you made fun of her. Luna... But that it's water under the bridge, that we should forgive. Yes, we should forgive. Your mom was always very nice. I hope you don't ever make fun of anyone again. Don't worry, I've grown up, I don't make fun of people anymore. You'd better not. - Do you want to take pictures? - Yes! Come on! Let's take some pictures with the kids! Okay, great.
