 - You copied me, you lost. - No. Now, a list of things you like about Buenos Aires. For example, the pizza parlors. Starting now. - Knowing I'm leaving. - Seeing my family. Clinics. - Huh? - Clinics. You like clinics? I love them. My dream is Villa Gesell having clinics like the ones in Buenos Aires. Don't look at me like I'm crazy. Don't you want to come with me? No way. Why do I always get old people snoring next to me when I travel? Yes.

 Yes, and you know what? I'm going to swim naked in the sea. Yes, there. Quiet, please. We're trying to sleep. So are we! Shut up, please. Stop it! A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES ON AIR ALMOST HAPPY I never used to like reunions. 7. "THE RETURN OF GASTÓN" And then I got over it. Now I enjoy myself. I stay three days and live them to the fullest. You know? I go to the theater, walk around, see my family. And now I don't mind going to the reunions with my classmates. Right? Aren't you interested? - You know what? If you want... - What? I'll go with you to your reunion with your friends. That would be great, they'll see I'm not alone. Though I'd like to show off someone better. - Really? - Yes. There's no one. - There isn't? - No. - Hey. - What? Let me through. - Where? - I'm going to the bathroom. Go ahead. Come on, get up. You can totally get by. - What an ass. - There's plenty of space. Yes. I didn't feel a thing. It'll be easier with him. He's shorter, it'll be better. Relax. Let it flow. Yes. Besides, he'll get here and be tired. He'll go to sleep, he traveled all night. - Make him breakfast, something good. - No, not breakfast. If I make him breakfast, he'll say, "What a shitty breakfast you made." - He'll criticize it. So, no. - Take it as a joke. I would love to, but I can't take it as a joke, let it flow, as brothers and friends. You know? But no, I can't. And I don't want to resent him. I don't want to get all worked up again. He abandoned us, he left. - He left me and my parents. - You told me. He didn't come to see my kids, left me alone with my parents. - But I don't want to resent him. - Of course. Want to practice another hug? Sure. But stand at his height. A little lower. A little more. No, a little higher. There. That's it. - Everything will be okay. - How do you know? I don't. It's what you say in cases like this. - Where are you going? - Let's see. Aren't you going to open? - I'm nervous. - Give him a hug. Sometimes, that's how brothers connect. You're an only child. But to me, you're like a brother. You're not like a brother to me. Well, not for me either. - I was joking. - Well, I'm going. Bye. Gato! Brother! Hey! Sebito. Gato. You didn't take a shower. - Yes, I did. - It doesn't smell like it. Must be your smell. Well, I did travel all night. In my case, it's justified. - Come in. - No, wait. Listen. - Come in. - No, see that taxi? There's a girl I met on the bus yesterday. It just happened. You don't know how beautiful she is. And I fell in love. So, we're going to a motel. Can you hold on to my suitcase? I don't get it. I met a girl on the bus, fell in love, we're sealing our love in a motel. Can you hold on to my suitcase? Are you crazy? Come in, take a shower, let's chat. No. You can see her tomorrow or some other day. No, there is no other day. It has to be now. I'm leaving tomorrow. - What do you mean tomorrow? - Yes, I'm leaving tomorrow. - Weren't you planning for two days? - Yes. - I don't get it, please explain. - I came for two days. I leave tomorrow. Where are you going? Why just two days? Because there are no international airports in Gesell. And why do you care about international airports in Gesell? So I can find a vehicle that goes from Gesell to Madrid, usually an airplane. You're going to Madrid? - No, you're going to Madrid. - I'm not going to Madrid. Then I'm the one going to Madrid. - You're right. Didn't I mention it? - No. When I leave the motel, I'll call you, okay? Pick up. Don't be a flake. Here's the suitcase. - And? - You know, it turned out to be a guy who came to return my suitcase. - Really? - No, not really. My brother. He met a girl on the bus and he's taking her straight to a motel. - I forgot Gastón was like that. - Why didn't you tell him to have sex here? What? Now I'm the asshole who didn't make him come in? Man, you're sensitive. The fact it gets to me makes me so mad. My life without him is so much better. He comes into my life, bam! Problems. It pisses me off. Who are you, dude? Who are you? He comes into my life two years later, out of the blue, in a bus, leaves his suitcase, goes to a motel with a girl he met ten minutes ago and leaves for Madrid tomorrow. He didn't come to visit me, he came to go to Madrid. And what pisses me off the most is I can't say it to his face. - Hey, let's do that today on the radio. - What? People can call in to say something they've never had the nerve to say. - What do you think? - No, terrible idea. Something else? - You're missing a great scene. - Huh? Well, I didn't know doing it that way was possible. - Huh? - I've never seen it. I wouldn't take that risk, though. I was just thinking, why didn't you bring your suitcase? You could've changed clothes. It didn't occur to me. At least I was able to see my brother for a bit. - Sure, you saw your brother there. - Yes. What? Do you have a deep bond? No? I'll call him later. I'm feeling a little pain here. I'm a bit out of breath. Really. Really? You're going to the clinic. Yippee! Can I kiss you like this? Do you have my cell phone? Yes. Here. Let my brother know. Yes. - What's his contact name? - Sebastián. That's cold. It could be Sebi, Seba, brother... Excuse me, is someone here by the name of Tati? - Sebastián? - Tati? - Tati? - No, Emi. You have me confused. - Oh, okay. - I always listen to you on the radio. - Thank you, I appreciate it. - I don't mean to bother you, no... My husband was admitted here and it's pretty serious. Could you say hi in a message to him? Sure. My brother is here, too. We're all here for something serious. But he loves you, Sebastián. Honestly, he'd be... You're so important to him and he's in very critical condition. - Okay, I'll do it. - I'm so scared. - I'll do it. - Sorry, I don't mean to act like this. - No, don't worry, I understand. - It's just a quick message, that's it. I totally get it, go ahead. - There. - Is it recording? - His name is Norberto. - Norberto. - Norberto... - Send him your love. Norberto, I send you my regards, you'll get better very soon. - Tell him who you are. - But he's looking at me. No, he's blind now. Okay. Norberto, this is Sebastián. Your wife says you listen to us on the radio. - I wish you the best, hope you're okay. - Get well. Get well soon. Your wife is strong, I'm sure you'll get better. Hi, how are you? Are you Tati? It's so weird to see you. Strange! It's as if I knew you. My brother is here. His name is Gastón. - Gastón is your brother? - Yes. Oh, you do look alike! No, you don't, actually. - How is he? - Who? - Gastón, my brother. - I'm sorry. I'm not used to seeing someone famous. Will you excuse me for a second? I once saw you at the mall. But I didn't want to bother you, you were with your wife and kids. Twins, right? - Tell me what happened to my brother. - Yes. I was just telling your sister-in-law. He has an obstruction that doesn't let him breathe properly, a thorax obstruction. He can't breathe properly. So we're running some tests... Hello, how are you? ...to see why his diaphragm is lifted. Why can that be? It could be anything. Look, he might have had it his whole life and it's just now appearing and completely inoffensive or it may be something else. Like what? Anything. Doctor, could you come over? Will you excuse me for a second? What are you up to? Where's Tati? She left. - And you didn't ask her to stay? - I didn't see her. How do you know she left? The doctor told me. Oh, so you talked to the doctor? No. Is everything okay? Am I going to die? They ran some tests, you need to pick them up tonight. - Tomorrow I'm going to Madrid. - So what? I'm fine, I feel fine. How about we get some pizza? I'm glad you made it. I was worried about you. But they ran the tests on you. Yes, but they told me that, since we share DNA, my results could show stuff about you. This isn't a foul in soccer, since I used my body. Yeah, that's right. - This is. - Yes, it is. And this, even more. - Hey, did Tati really leave? - Yes, Tati left. - You scare girls away, see? - No, I don't. I want to say that us cowardly men and women have a space here in Life in the Middle, ladies and gentlemen. For all of us who have a masters in avoiding saying things face-to-face. All of us who struggle expressing ourselves, who have an important meeting with a boss, a friend, with a relative, our partner, and there's something we need to say, but it's hard for us to speak. We really struggle. So we practice the conversation the night before... What are you drinking? Beer. - Want some? - Yes. - Go back there. - Yes. - So the camera doesn't catch you. - All right. We're opening the line, you can call and say everything to that person you have no courage to speak up to. Hello to the first caller. Good afternoon, good night. Hi, Seba, I'm Marcos. Hi, Marcos, how are you? Who do you want to speak up to, Marcos? My boss. I can't tell him how I feel to his face. Now's the time, Marcos! Let it all out, now's the time! To you, who never paid me what I deserved. You always thought I had to thank you for giving me work. Go on, Marcos, go on. What's your boss's name? - Ángel. - Give it to Ángel! Give him everything you've got, Marcos! You made the stupid joke of saying you were an "angel." You were an idiot. You inherited that factory from your dad and you're going to destroy it, moron. Give me my severance pay and fire my ass, Ángel. Well done, Marcos, great. You let it out. Wish you the best. A big hug to you. You did it, Marcos, you did it! Let's take the next caller. Who's on the line? - Hi, Seba. - Who is this? Luli. Luli! How are you, Luli? Who do you want to speak up to, Luli? To my ex, Franco. Coward, asshole, moron, male chauvinist. Franco-ist, coward, asshole, moron, male chauvinist! - Why a male chauvinist? - There's a radio station in Gesell, too. I go sometimes. Really? I'd like to work there. Really? - Yeah. - I'll ask. I'd escape all of this shit. Hey, would you listen to the show? See what I mean? Kisses to you, Luli. You did it, Luli. Kisses and farewell. And on to the next caller. Do you do the show every day? Uh-huh. So, - you come to the studio every day? - Yes. If I do it every day, I have to come every day. You look really happy. Yes, I love doing it, honestly. I can tell. And are you always politically correct? Not at all, I'm anything but politically correct. - On air, of course not. - Come on, are you serious? The employee who talks about his boss, the girl who talks about her ex, you call anything "male chauvinistic." No, not just anything. The girl said her boyfriend didn't like her making more money than him. - It's chauvinistic. - What do you know? You don't know him. Well, she said it. Why are we walking up these... let's say, hills of life? Why don't we walk on a flat surface? Because I take this route every time I leave the station. But why? I feel like I'm going to succeed in life if I do. That's a good reason. And are you succeeding? - Sort of. - So, change. I don't feel like it. - So you're leaving for Madrid tomorrow? - Yes. Hopefully the plane won't crash. You never know, but if it doesn't... You'll get there. I'll get there and there'll be a beautiful girlfriend awaiting me. A girl I saw in Gesell, who went to live in Madrid and... Nice. - I can't wait to see her. - Okay. I didn't even tell Mom and Dad you're here. Good, it'll spare me the reproaches. I'll see them when I get back. No, you won't. Maybe you're right. I don't think it's funny. What? Here comes the speech about how I left you alone with them. Well, you did. You left me alone with them. I can't believe we're having this talk again. Okay then, let's go. Do you remember what they told me when I left? I remember perfectly. - And? - And what? Do you agree? Do you think I should be happy about it? Well, they're old. - Yes, I'm old, too. - No, truly old. - I'm a grown-up, too. - Okay. They have an eldest son. You don't have kids, you don't get it, but this first child suddenly decides to leave everything. He leaves college, his girlfriend, he skips town. - And goes to live in Villa Gesell. - And goes to live in Villa Gesell. - Can you believe it? - Joke around, come on. I always thought if I went to Necochea, maybe it would've been fine by them. Yes, maybe. - Because it's near Quequén. - What? Come on, walk with me. Hi, how's it been? All good? - Two hot dogs. - No, I'm fine. Yes. No, really, I don't want one. Thanks. Two hot dogs. I'm not eating. You would've loved coming with me to Gesell. I can picture Gesell on August 15th, ten degrees below zero, raining, and I start to cry. - Eat. - I don't want to. - Eat up. - I said I don't want to. Why are our conversations always like this? - I don't know. - Why don't we ever have fun? Why don't you behave with me the way you do on the radio? Maybe it's you and not me. Maybe there's a reason I'm one way with others and different with you. - Well, let's change it. - All right. Let's go out tonight. Come with me. Tati is with her old classmates. You have no idea what they're like. Me neither since I don't know them, but Tati is gorgeous. - They must be gorgeous. - I don't feel like it. Seba, let's do something different. We never go out together, come on. Is it far? It's nearby. - Okay, let's go. - Great. Hey, he's paying. Keep the change. Don't you feel better? Now we're doing something we've never done, something unexpected. That's how you change your life, not by walking up and down a hill. - But let's go get your results first. - Why? I'm leaving for Madrid tomorrow. So what? To know what's wrong. - What for? I'm going to die tomorrow! - You mean fly! Okay then, it was with an "F." We need to know what's wrong. What will that change? I'm going anyway. If you're ill, will your sickness say, "Let's not attack this dude, he's in Madrid. Let him enjoy his holiday." Seba, I'm not ill. - Look... - I feel there's nothing wrong. I wasn't going to tell you, but the doctor said it could be anything. Well, I wasn't going to tell you, but I don't give a damn what the doctor says. I wasn't going to tell you, but you're a jackass sometimes. I wasn't going to tell you, but we have that in common. But I'm the jackass that takes care of his parents. You just don't get it. I honestly don't care. I don't care what the doctor says or what the results are. - I'm leaving tomorrow. - Okay. You're asking me to put things that are too heavy in my tiny suitcase. The doctor, the worry, the illness, Mom, Dad, your kids. There's no room for them, Seba. I have to travel lightly or I'll die. I won't be able travel, I won't be able to move. Do you know what's in my suitcase? A girlfriend in Madrid. The possibility of seeing her and being happy for a while, of touring Spain with her. And tonight, the possibility of being happy for a while with Tati, who's gorgeous and with my brother. Look, there's our car. Are you coming? Okay, then.
