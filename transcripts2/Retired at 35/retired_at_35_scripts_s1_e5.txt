let women or clients into the house ever I texted you and I called you and then I threatened Gabby who threatened Lex that worried about me huh about you oh no no I'm doing this for it entirely selfish reasons because if I lose my love coach then I lose my love mm-hmm sorry just feel so good you don't make me feel even better right now mmm you and a hot nurse outfit okay right but I'm more

want me to blow in your soup are you 12 all right shit it's really hot blow well well coming from you I'll take that is the highest of compliments so what are we watching what's up sweet cheeks that was it do you ever think that that may be what she thought you wanted isn't actually what you want anymore I mean like you spend your entire life in pursuit of one goal then hopeful something changes yeah that's exactly what I mean that's life Blake how's that that just doesn't feel so wishy-washy to go from one thing to another that's all part of college discovering yourself I mean I think hey maybe wearing flip-flops from 1992 wasn't as cool that they're not mine oh really so you just stole someone's flip-flops decided hey let's bring these back no they were my brothers and after he died I I don't know I just I just wanted to be close to him so you raided his clothes what everything smelled like chemins was comforting until he had to wash it until my dad forced me to watch them yeah well it's only been two years I still miss them I know yeah car accident drunk driver that's weird I used to I used to piss me off so bad talking about it but some reason when I started wearing his clothes it's like I don't know it almost feels like invisible armor well I hate to break it to you but these flip-flops mm-hmm or anything but visible yeah first rule of kindergarten Oh would you just like us I must have missed it oh you must have it once right up there with fire safety so it's a little important hmm okay yeah well I told you never to play the player hey I'm just following your rules that's all sometimes I hate my rules me too [Music] whoa whoa we're training we're training you know we're setting up for a date for her and you know David he's movement do the steps so fast you know I figured he's gonna do something yeah I think I got it thank you Ian wait wait look I'm sorry okay I'm sorry I got carried away I'll help you David and then hopefully we can be friends friends it's funny how words that are supposed to make people happy kind of make you want to punch a tree like Chuck Norris yeah friends friends it is you know this isn't a sting right you can take your sunglasses off plus we're we're indoors you look ridiculous hey you said no eye contact and that happens to be very difficult for me a soap it sunglasses dude just look at his crotch I'll eat that shit up I'm not looking no no do you have any other pointers that don't involve me staring at his groin I think you can do better than that miss nursing major nope not doing penis oh look he can't even say should you really be playing with it I mean no come here eventually you're gonna have to get past the point of being afraid of your own sexuality something tells me that David's not super great in bed so you're gonna have to get a little bit of confidence so you can tell him what you want and what makes you think that I mean I'm a virgin so oh I'm gonna suck impossible believe me David on the other hand the last girlfriend we interview said that although he deserved an A for effort on multiple occasions she studied for a test during during sex mm-hmm that's so impersonal I mean shouldn't you be putting your your whole mind into it your body your soul we're gonna have track the point is that you're probably gonna have to give him some direction and you're gonna have to say words like penis okay the end fine penis Oh louder penis hey man didn't see you there hey how's it going I thought y'all were more casual I know we made it official last night right sweet cheeks sorry yeah it's just it was a really great night yeah great night good happy for you Blake really happy for you yeah we should uh we should get out of here what are you laughing they were just gave me the

that I can't play football and this kid could have died well he's sort of dead too I mean in a way you lost part of what made you you in him I got past it you know okay I want you to think I'm one of those broken guys living the old glory days of football how'd you get over it it was the kid he um he came and visited me in the hospital and I actually stood calm by his last name Montgomery our little Monty cuz it was tiny and apparently he's so afraid of the dark so he brought me this bear smartly named bear and his mom unfortunately passed away earlier that year from cancer and she gave him that bear it was supposed to be like his protection bear to make him feel safe and he gave it to me said he didn't need it anymore because he had me that bear lives the high life in my room will

something wrong yeah I gotta take Blake on this fake date so she doesn't puke all over David mm-hmm be at the house at 6:00 have gabs help you get ready she is the boss I hate mornings there already think so late come on it can't be that bad let's go no it is very bad damn is it that bad yeah it's uh it's horrific how could you expect to attract a man in this monstrosity monstrosity huh huh is that why you keep staring on it I literally can't look away don't even think I could if I tried fake date remember this is a fake date so I don't make a fool out of myself when I go out with David on Thursday okay but ii leave this house you've got to pretend it's real I'll coach you and hopefully by Thursday we'll get news of a tragic accident that David's lost all functionality of his penis are you sure I look okay no Blake you look phenomenal if that bastard doesn't say those exact words are better he's not deserving okay shall we yes are you having a picnic or something rule number 9 Blake if a guy wants to surprise the shit out of you don't question it just tell him how awesome yes okay well you are awesome and best fake date ever hey you know what we need to pretend like this is real remember or what's the point I don't know maybe a fun night some good food all right we're canoeing towards the restaurant yeah okay I have to admit to you that is it's pretty cool although I don't know how much help I'm gonna be in distress won't cross my heart I won't look up your skirt rule number seven and always lie I'm Julio I'll be your server this evening can I get you started with anything yeah can we have two margaritas on the rocks rule number ten only two drinks not three not four I know you can get nervous but after you go past two drinks you can lose your inhibition and things can get out of control real fast two is a safe number and yeah you know because you're gonna need that for your cardio later cardio yeah sex with David oh I am I haven't really thought about that mmm it's a nice special please Thanks you know what's gonna happen eventually right yeah I don't know I don't really like thinking about it because well honestly it kind of makes me want to puke huh no it's just I'm gonna be horrible and then I make a fool out of myself and then he's gonna hate it number six guys never hate sex okay if he's not getting off it's either because he mistakenly use numbing jealous of KY or he's gay and you just lack the goods to get in there okay why you still need another minute yeah if you can't even talk about having sex with David I just why are you even going on a date with him I get it why are you even using my help it's just I don't know don't you think it's moving so fast I wanted him to notice me I didn't want him to take me to bed two weeks after your little plan works well then just say no rules 12 13 and 14 clearly say that you can absolutely say no so how did you get into this how did you start wingman actually it was my sister she was at the time crushing really hard on this guy for my team and I say hard I mean she drove her car into a mailbox when we had him over for fourth of July yeah the sad thing is is he was in knew her too she was always so shy and insecure to ever meet him halfway and I was always just too selfish to give a shit so she settled she's all for a guy who thinks that video games are like the Olympics so there's two types of settling there's a type that is cute a match made in heaven were you look at a couple holding hands in public and you think exact role legally blind and then there's the other type of settling which is the insecure type while her girl never reaches her full potential and settles for someone you know that's what she's worth my sister deserve better and if she had just an ounce of confidence it would have changed her life now if she even had one rule for my playbook it would have changed her life well and so the playbook to the playbook okay the final rule your feeling like the dates going good and you want to continue it's up to you to invite them in okay yeah no do you want to come in Wow that depends on what do you have refreshments you can't just invite someone and expecting something to happen you have to have coffee drink late-night movie it's kind of an unwritten rule all of the above how's that thanks enter [Music] screw David you mind [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] gasps you gonna suffocate me no Blake's a friend and now it's gonna be awkward not to mention she's a frickin client what the hell were you thinking what I really liked her that David's a douche and that I'd rather die than let him touch her you aren't bailing does it look like I'm jumping out the window or making up some story about my dog you know how a dog I know where's Blake baking she got up with the ass crack of dawn went for a four mile run and then she decided to make you pancakes pancakes mm-hmm all right hi are you making pancakes yeah good morning morning it's safe to relax he was freaking out that you missed your normal meeting at the bench so shit I didn't mean to sleep in I know you looked exhausted though and I didn't wanna wake you up I was exhausted sweet cheeks but the best type of way the type where you probably should take a week off of school mm-hmm me too think of the possibility this could change for life well maybe it is I could get really addicted these no not in the kitchen you guys I will seriously grab the pillow from upstairs now break apart for once I am NOT cooking so I went to sit and enjoy my coffee without watching real life porn who got late last night you know you can't hook up with clients yeah that contract got terminated the second she screamed my name okay so no David yes no did you say yet one he's still a friend and I I'm still gonna go to dinner with him I'm a friend named we screwed one four times last night I'm sorry was that all it was - you know I don't know where there's more reason why I don't think you should be going on a date with douche pants look it's fine okay I promise you it is fine okay no no no put me down we'll be back you're gonna read the compatibility report with Blake I haven't decided yet are you doing home I live here unless you're kicking me out which you may do have to read in the report it's that bad stats show that if client a Blake or do embark on a relationship with client B Ian there is a 50% chance that one or both hearts will be broken in a relational and within two months once the honeymoon stage is done yeah David's father it's gone poor shows that if client a or doe barking a relationship with clients see there is an 87% chance that the relationship will be a success and it will bloom Blake and David not on my watch all right you know what I think you should fake the flu tonight Ian look at me mmm I can't it just it reminds me that tonight he's gonna be looking at you and every time I think about him in the same damn room I want to cut his damn shooting hand off and bury it in Gabe's yard okay listen the sooner I can get tonight's dinner over with and tell him how happy I am with you the sooner we can just put this whole David thing behind us okay just just go hi I'm I'm not gonna be the crazy ass boyfriend who's jealous and drives you to your date so just go maybe I'll see you tonight I'll come by your place after you okay yep you know don't let him touch you okay not even on your back so he's touching your back means he's thinking about touching your ass all right mm-hmm I promise trust me yeah go get him yeah coming through today you make that compatibility report for me and Blake because you knew that eventually I jump into commitment I input your information the moment I saw things start to change between you and Blake hell the minute I noticed the linger come again the linger you lingered you leaned every muscle in your body tensed when she walked into the room I've never seen you linger like that shit I'm a fifty David's an 87 and he's with her right now I'll Drive she's facing him she's not sitting across from but to the side bastard may have skills after all you want to see no that's the last thing I want to see us how close he's sitting door well he's strategically dropping his napkin so we can inch his chair closer it's scary how well you know the male gender dinner is over ordering dessert then I'll be home don't worry we should go okay yeah we should go I hope you enjoyed your dessert get me drunk does it feel oh you mean getting my heart broken gee I don't know max kind of tickles again your feather stuck in my ass I mean being on the other side another one who gets rejected he's a better fit the numbers don't lie the numbers right yeah the numbers don't take into account chemistry may computers can't do that mhm look we're still technically under contracts with Blake per our agreement so as long as she's gone on her date with David and kissed him the contract technically done so terminate the contract Klug payment and delete her information do you like this by ignoring her you run the risk that what did I lose her forever she's already gonna she made her decision she kissed him I'm gonna get back hey is in here I need to talk to you like you should go I'm not leaving until I talk to him likes he doesn't understand what he saw and I I just need to explain hey wait to me why the hell was some other guy kissing you I'd much rather talk to Ian about that tough shit oh you got me okay he kissed me Lex and you kissed him back mmm I'm missing some important detail here where you pushed him away you need him in the ball I I did push him away he hesitated you must be proud of yourself the first girl to take down Ian Hunter he just toss them aside the second year childhood crush looks your way David and I are just friends that's it and you and you nor what you kissed another dude whatever you and Ian had is over expect the contract termination Anna and honestly I think your bitch yeah come on har nothing I didn't I didn't mean to call her a bitch I just got a cop in the moment yeah hey hey she cares about you she's gonna be back three two no don't talk for two seconds so I can speak tell Ian that I need to talk to him and I'm not gonna stop calling him until he hears me out I love him I love him good answer well be in touch can I talk to you did you get my email we're done no we're not Ian I love you I love you so much and I'm so sorry about the kiss but it I was confused and it had nothing to do with you yeah no shit look you did us both a favor our projected success rate wasn't even close to being good you should probably go be with who you wanted all along you know all of that's changed there's the sex chemical reaction occurs that emotionally bonds you with someone when you have sex with them give it a few days it'll wear off so while I in I'm telling you that I love you and you're just you're gonna push me away don't do that don't in don't you care about me like even a tiny bit your boyfriend's waiting my boyfriend is standing right in front of me not anymore yeah be happy okay hey and good to see you buddy oh yeah I'm out of here and David treat her right Oh certainly we'll just like I did last night disrespect God again I'll kill you Judy it was a joke I'm kidding and you have said the same stuff you said the same babe yeah and wait please let me talk wait please look I only kissed David to make sure of my feelings and it felt wrong and and horrible and it just confirmed to me that I loved you that before after you screwed up are you kidding me how does it go from kissing to sex I basically walked you through the steps Blake are we done so done [Music] I know what you're thinking I played this all wrong I should call her no she gets David he's the right fit for her I won't call her but I miss her fuck it I'll text her I miss you you rejected me when I said I love you go to hell smiley face a smiley face well a smiley face means that there's still hope right but we all know what smiley face does not mean I want to have sex with you sometimes the smiley face just means I'm happy but that means she was happy for me to go to hell or just happy get up stop moping around look I love you like a brother this compatibility report is ruining your life does I break her heart in two months and David on the other hand she'd be in total bliss yeah well I may have tweaked the numbers a bit what did you do what what I had to do you when we first started wingmen deal with we both took never fall in love and what on that same drunken evening would you make me swear to you that you won't let me mm-hmm and why is that cuz I'm sick of losing shit yeah man your sauce on my back so I did I changed the numbers man just a little but enough for you to bail don't you get it it doesn't matter the numbers can be manipulated but the heart can't Dan poet so you get so much ass I know we're David's party tonight and word on the street is he's at it alone while gab things that would Blake care for a drink what yeah I wish mr. goody two-shoes oh look a butterfly let's hug the tree actually as bad as I wish he was oh is that were the case yeah but it's not one of the most important stats guys typically mess up within two weeks of a new relationship and why is that god complex god complex translation I stole a sexy piece of ass from Ian Hunter so I can get any chick that I want so come hither my pretties well show you what a real man can do you silver-tongued devil get your shit together believe in 15 [Music] [Music] I'm downtown and you need a ride is it normal to see Pinocchio after doing shrimps I'll be right there just like that I'm back in the game you don't look high as a kite did you want to get a drink no I don't want to get a drink you do realize the last time I saw you you almost killed David and somehow simultaneously broke my heart in the process and now you're just gonna call me drunk and out I'm not drunk okay I have a confession to make and I know it's not particular romantic but I love you just throw out and I love you well hi Wow dope being high and yeah I did because it's true iPhone ass over heels in love with you I desperately want you I know I I need you I fucking crave you I was scared you're scared yeah an hunter is scared I'm scared that you'd be settling for me when David is the one you wanted all you know that I would be sailing with him and I wouldn't be settling with you you know it I promise you this it will only ever be you bike you're the only person I want to wake up with the only person I want to spend my nights with I love you I love you just kiss him already yeah [Music] so this is the part of the story where we cheer to new beginnings and lots of happy endings and while I pride myself for the success of wingman Inc I've learned firsthand that sometimes sure what sweet cheeks do you uh you might as I was saying sometimes you just need to forget all the rules and just follow your heart oh that's too bad you know I was really hoping we could do a rule number 18 again did Ian talk to you he talks to me everyday you need any more specific now that he's a flake he wants to limit his wingman work and said I could work with you guys not a chance to know oh there's a chance yeah chance will poison my lucky charms and we'll kill each other if you were an ocean I dive in some sand coming for a deep breath hold it and take your wave again if you were a just song just got along be part of your son in the every time I see you I just [Music] spawning a class to do and I would know what to do just wanna cackle asti you if you are spoon shot Oh whiskey I drink down slowly have another round if you are so dance
