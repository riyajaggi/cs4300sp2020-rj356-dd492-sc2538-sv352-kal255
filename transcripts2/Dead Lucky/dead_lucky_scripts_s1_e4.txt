 I will find your girlfriend. I know the boys blame her for Lincoln's death. He wanted to call for back-up and you told him not to. You let me know if she has any inappropriate episodes. If you leave now, it'll be seen as a disciplinary breach. He's Corey's, but I couldn't let him have this baby. I needed to distract him. He had a girlfriend, seven years ago. She has a seven-year-old kid so the timing was perfect. I tried to tell you that he wasn't yours, but you wouldn't listen. What have I done?

 - Would you have dinner with me? - Okay. It's a letter. For Mani. You can't go. Mary noticed her passport was missing. Told the police. You want me to take all the blame? I have a baby. You made me pull the trigger. No, I didn't. You panicked. You can't blame me. I'm trying to help you. It isn't fair! Bo-Lin! An alert is out for a silver station wagon, similar to this one, driven by a man, with a woman and young boy as passengers. Now there are two ways out of Claire's house to the highway.

 There's here and here. They're both major intersections. There must be cameras. Yeah. At both sets of lights. So we searched the footage around the time the car was heard leaving Claire's house. No matches? Well, there are four matches for the vehicle, but none of them had three passengers and none of the male drivers fit Corey's description. Corey's not driving. Sorry? He took Claire for three reasons. - Hostage. - Human shield. And as a driver. We're looking for a female driver and a young boy. And where's Corey? Hiding. Shit, they've found us. Turn off. - What? - Just do it. TYRES SQUEAL, HORNS BLARE - Where are we going? - Just keep driving. (GASPS) Hi. Sorry. Had to work late last night. These are for you. We'll do dinner, too. These were just because I was thinking about you and I was getting coffee and there was a florist - and one thing led to another... - I can't. - Sorry? - It doesn't feel right. Ah, the flowers? All of it. - But yesterday you said... - I know. I've changed my mind. Well, if this is about Lincoln and you need more time, I can wait. - I'm sorry. - LIFTS DINGS Oh, there you are. Listen, a young woman was found dead in Redfern. The body description matches Bo-Lin. I'm gonna need you there too, Anna. She was found in the skip? Yeah. Time of death was at least eight hours ago. And she fell from there? Mm. Broke her neck on the edge of the bin. Oh. - She's had a haircut. - Like Mary's. She was planning on using her passport. - Before this. - Yeah. - She have anything with her? - No phone, nothing. Doesn't look like she jumped. Plus, Forensics found splinters under her fingernails. She was trying to hang on, on the way down. - So she was pushed? - Looks that way. This place has been wiped clean. Whoever this was, they know how to cover their tracks. What have you got? Oi! Get up. We're goin'. Where's Toby? Toby! Mum, I'm hungry. Okay, mate. We're goin' for a walk. All three of us. Where are we going? The best way is to be direct. Stick to the facts. Be compassionate but not too emotional. It's their loss, not ours. You don't have to do this. I can. No, I can do it. Maybe it's a good sign Bo-Lin didn't get on the plane. - We can get the landlord to fix that. - Like last time? It was six weeks before he did anything. You skipped your exam yesterday, man. You need to call your lecturer and explain. You can ask for special consideration. Until I find Bo-Lin, I don't care about my degree. KNOCK AT DOOR Bo-Lin's body was found this morning at Redfern. We believe she may have died after falling from a warehouse window. MARY SOBS No! She fell? It appears she may have been pushed. Who did this? We don't know. I'm sorry. I want to see her. Of course. I have to see her. We'll arrange that as soon as possible. All right, thanks. The DNA found on the cigarette at the warehouse is Corey Baxter's. He pushed her? It was Corey's? He must have collided with her at the store. She saw him shoot Tony. He didn't want her to talk so he locked her away. When he couldn't figure out what to do with her, he pushed her out the window. - No. - What do you mean, no? No, it's not Corey's MO. If Bo-Lin had got in his way, he'd have just shot her then and there, just like he did everybody else. Instead, he keeps her alive. Why? His mate said he kept women locked up in Queensland. Yeah, but there's no sign of sexual assault. - Well, he locked Claire up. - That's different. He thought Toby was his child. Fits in with his whole obsession with being a father. But to keep Bo-Lin hidden at the warehouse, to buy her a ticket to China, it's not him. Baxter's DNA was found at the crime scene. - You're ignoring physical evidence. - No, I'm not ignoring it. I'm just trying to make sense of it, Charlie. It doesn't make sense. - Everything okay here? - BOTH: Yep. - You're on restricted duties. - What? I warned you there'd be ramifications if you walked out on that meeting yesterday. I'm in the middle of a murder investigation. I just had a phone call from the Education Minister, who wants to know why that student you're meant to have found is now dead. Do you know how bad this looks? I'm sorry, what did you just say? Grace, there are broader implications here. International students are a multi-billion dollar industry. Well, I'm sorry if Bo-Lin's death has been inconvenient - from a budgetary perspective... - Don't twist my words. I don't have to. Your gun's padlocked. I get it. I'm your scapegoat. You need to tell the Minister you've penalised an officer. Lucky me. People are so fuckin' stupid, they never notice when you swap their plates. Yeah, you can hardly tell. All right, time to go. - My legs hurt. - It's all right. It's not too far. Takes ages. Should've known he's not mine. He's a wimp. I saw a sign for a service station down the road. Maybe we can stop and get some food. That's right. I said we'd get snacks, didn't I? - Yeah. - Well, guess what? I lied. Now you know how it feels. How's Mani? Sorry? The boyfriend of the girl who died. His name's Mani, isn't it? Yeah. Ah, not good, as can be expected. Listen, I can't stop thinking about this passport. See, I know Bo-Lin's friends weren't helping her out, because they've been under constant surveillance. They couldn't have got Mary's passport to her. But that leaves just one other scenario. That Bo-Lin took Mary's passport to the store. But why would she do that? I don't think she meant to hurt Tony, so why would she be thinking about skipping the country? I don't know. I told you I don't remember if I saw Mary's passport that day. I seized Bo-Lin's. That's all I know. Oh, okay. Don't you like roses? - What? - Charlie's flowers. Oh, um... Yeah, that's not gonna work. Oh, that's a shame. Weren't you two having dinner yesterday? Did something change? It's just it's not the right time. Yeah, of course. That's a pretty good match, eh? Yeah. Yeah, that's... That's really smart. I wouldn't have thought of that. Yeah, well, lucky I'm in charge, then. Yeah. Where... where are we going? That's for me to know and you to find out. Are we still going to Queensland? Mmm... It's stuck. - Eh? - My pirate sword, in the key hole. What? See? Oh, fuck. Fuck! What'd you do that for, ya little shithead? Don't touch him! We're gonna go. And you're not gonna follow. Or what? I'll shoot. - You don't have the guts. - Really? Come on, Claire bear... Run, Toby, run! Fuck! You fuckin' bitch! Arghh! Oh! It's her. But then it's not her. The haircut? It's not that. But... she doesn't look like her any more. Look at her. She's gone. You can have as long as you like. I'll wait outside. (WHISPERS UNINTELLIGIBLY) Corey Baxter's on the run. He has a woman and a boy with him. It's all over the news. Yeah. Isn't it strange that he made a run for it the same night Bo-Lin... He held a gun at my head. I know what that man is capable of. We'll tell you as soon as we know anything. You've said that before. Where is Detective Gibbs? She's been held up back at the station. - Can I drive you home... - No, thank you. I'll walk. How'd you go? Mani's a mess. He already suspects Corey. We should tell him about the cigarette. It's not fair to keep him in the dark. - Listen, I need to talk to you. - Not now. A woman and her son just hailed down a truck on the Pacific Highway. - Claire? - She's at Hawkesbury LAC. No Baxter, but she has a description of where he was. Go! - What about you? - Ah, it's a long story. Um... He... he made us walk to a... a commuter carpark that was about 20 minutes away... OVER CAR RADIO:..and he found a car and he swapped the plates. Do you remember any of the numbers or letters? Even one would help. Ah, no, I was... I was just looking at the gun. I couldn't see anything else. Do you know the name of the road Corey had you pull over on last night? Um... We... we took a turnoff just before Gosford. It was dark and I... I could only see the road. And then when we ran today, I was just looking for help, so it's all a bit of a... bit of a blur. Can you remember seeing anything? Anything at all? There... there was a picnic area. Green picnic tables. Was it near anything? A river, a lookout, or? There was a creek. Garrakool Picnic Area, Old Pacific Highway, Kurrayong. SIREN SOUNDS G'day, mate. Detective Senior Constable Varma. - You got something there? - Yeah, this. - This is the place. - One pirate sword. Corey got the car to work. He's back out there. Yeah, in a common model station wagon with unknown number plates. Doesn't exactly lower our options. Maybe he won't get far. How long have you been working at Redfern Travel? Too long. Yesterday, a one-way ticket to Shanghai was processed on your computer, in the name of a Mary Ho. Do you remember who might have purchased that ticket? I'm bad with faces. I go more off someone's vibe. Could it have been her? Nope. It was a guy. How about him? I'm not sure. I think this guy was old. Define old. 40s. 50s, even. Do you think you can describe him? I was actually kind of distracted. I was bidding on this first edition Nirvana vinyl, so... Oh...not really. Soz. Yep, I'm soz too. Forensics found this at the crime scene for you. Oh, thanks. Is everything okay between you and Matty? Yeah. It's just he's got me doing all the drop-offs and picks-ups. - I thought he might be avoiding you? - No, I don't think so. I'm sorry about the young girl being found. I know this has been a really difficult case for you. Thanks, Penny. - Where are you going? - Lunch. - It's 10am. - I've got a big appetite. Is Mani inside? He's gone to get a new hose for the washing machine. He's fixing it. Keeping busy. It seems to help him. Actually, I need to ask you something. When Constable Jamison seized Bo-Lin's passport, where was it? Here. So you showed her this drawer? What did you do then? I remember Bo-Lin kept other documents, like bank details in this drawer. So you knelt down like that? I thought the police might want them, too, but she said no. Thanks. - Why is this important? - I'm just checking on something. She gave me that card for my birthday. What are you doing? We found a letter at the crime scene where Bo-Lin was killed. Is that her handwriting? Yes. It's addressed to you. I made you a copy. BO-LIN: We've only been apart for two days but it feels like months since we were snuggled together in your blanket room. I would do anything to be back there right now, but that's not possible. I have made a terrible mistake. I need to go back to China. Please come and meet me. The only way I can leave is the thought that you will find me and we will be together, snuggling somewhere else again, very soon. Where's the rest? She didn't sign it. That was all that was in the envelope when we found it. Someone's taken the rest. It's possible. Can I help you? I heard that woman escaped. Claire Diego? Yeah. Did she really shoot Baxter? Could he be dead? We don't know. He got away. Is there something I could have done differently? If I could still play it differently with you, I would. No, you did nothing wrong. - Charlie? Got that meeting. - What meeting? You know the one. Didn't you get the message? We're late. What are we doing up here? What meeting is this? I want to tell you something. You're not gonna like it. Okay. You'll think I'm crazy, but I want you to hear me out, all right? I think I know who did this to Bo-Lin. It was Anna. - Funny. - No, I know, listen to me. She's been acting really weird. Then something just clicked for me. When I asked her about Bo-Lin's passport, she got really defensive. And? So when she seized it, she had access to Mary's. She knew the police were meeting the plane. She could've tipped her off. I think somehow, maybe they're in this together. Wait, you're right. This is crazy. You're not making any sense. What did she just ask you about? Corey getting shot, but that's because... That's because she's hoping he's dead, because she framed him. What? Look, what if she planted the cigarette butt at the warehouse? She could've collected it from Claire's. She knows all about how to clean up a crime scene. She could have left the letter for Mani and taken out any pages that incriminated her. See, the only thing that doesn't add up is who bought the ticket in Mary's name. That was a man. There's got to be an explanation, right? All this time I've been defending you and Richard's right. And what's this got to do with Richard? He asked me for dirt on you. What? I didn't say anything but maybe I should have. Like you've totally lost it. Listen, Charlie, I know this is really hard for you to consider... It's not enough that you killed her husband but now you wanna blame Anna for murder? - What happened to Lincoln... - I know. It's not your fault. - Keep telling yourself that! - I have never told myself that and I have felt terrible about it every single day since. He was one of my favourite people. Why would Anna have done this? Have you even asked yourself that? I think their paths crossed. Maybe at the store. I think Anna went back for some reason. So you're saying she killed Tony too? Are you actually saying that? I don't know. You're insane. - Hello, Dr Pierce? - Yes? I wanted to talk to you about one of your students. Mani Dalir. Oh yes, I heard what happened to his girlfriend. It's awful. How's he holding up? Not so well. He doesn't care about university right now but he will, when he's had more time. I hope so. He's one of my best students. I wanted to make sure there will still be a place for him here, when he's ready to come back. PHONE RING TONE Hey, love, aren't you at work? Yeah, Dad. I just wanted to check how George is. Oh, he's good. We've been looking for birds. Nap time now. - Will you give him a cuddle from me? - Yeah. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you tonight. All right. Sleepy time, mister. - Constable Jamison? - Yes? You're working on Bo-Lin's case, right? I'm one of the officers. I need some paperwork for Mani Dalir. His lecturer was understanding, but she needs a full police report. Mani will make a great doctor. I know it. But I've never seen two people so in love as Bo-Lin and Mani were. It will take a lot for him to get over this. I'm sorry. For your friend, I mean. It's just been so hard on him, not knowing anything for so long. I guess now they've found the cigarette at the crime scene, he has some closure? Cigarette? Yes? They're keeping things from you, man. - What? - The police. They found a cigarette with Corey Baxter's DNA. It was at the warehouse where she died. Do you still have your hire car? Hey. Pack of Island Gold Classics. Hey, Charlie. Almost didn't recognise you in a suit. - Very sharp, detective. - Thanks. Hey, don't feel bad about the promotion, mate. I'm happy for you. Anna will get it next time. That's what I said. Hey, Ian, this may seem like a strange question, but on the day that I got my detective gig... do you remember what time Anna got home? Yeah, it was late. Me and Georgie were in bed, but I think I heard her come in. Anna got off work pretty early that day, around midday. You sure she didn't come home earlier? It was after ten. She's not in some kind of trouble, is she? - Is this about that girl? - Who? Anna's been helping out this young woman in a nasty relationship. Her boyfriend keeps beating her up. Don't mention anything, will you? Anna wanted to keep it quiet. Do you remember her name? Yeah. Mary. Mary Ho. Anna wanted to get her back to China, out of the country, away from this arsehole. But she was concerned that she'd get into strife at work for getting too involved. Police officers are only supposed to do so much. That's why I helped out. I thought that if I bought the airline ticket, Anna's hands'd be clean. She probably saved this young woman's life. Don't mention I've said any of this, will you, mate? Anna really wanted to keep it quiet. Sure. She's a good girl. I don't need to tell you that. Anna's dad booked the flight. What? That's the missing part to your puzzle. What, Ian's in on it? No. She fed him some story. He thinks she's helping out some woman called Mary. I'm so sorry, Charlie. What are you going to do? We'll need to get a match on the footprints from the store. It'd be good to place Anna at the warehouse, too. Wait, you called her last night, to cancel dinner. We can use that call to trace where she was. It must have been quite close to the time of death. Listen... Don't beat yourself up. You couldn't have known. Okay, we've just had a triple O. Charlie. Charlie, you okay? Yeah, he's fine. Petrol station in North Ryde was just robbed at gunpoint. The cashier is hiding in the storeroom. He saw the getaway car. It matches Baxter's. - Wait, the guy's still in the storeroom? - Yeah. Well, then how did he see the getaway car? I don't know, that's what he said. The guy blew smoke in his face. That's Baxter's MO. Did he mention that the robber had been shot? - You saw the blood, right, Charlie? - There was a lot of blood. - Has anyone called the landline? - The landline's dead. Nobody's answering the mobile phone. Marco's waiting. Go! He should take someone else. Hey, it's not a question. That is an order. - I answer to Detective Gibbs. - You both answer to me. Or you just backed the wrong horse, Constable. Matty! Downstairs! Marco! Corey made that call. He's trying to distract us. But why does he want us to go to North Ryde? Because he wants us there... ...while he gets to here. He's been shot. He's bleeding. He's on his last legs. Where else is he gonna go? They're in a rush. Maybe they've found him. Let's go inside. Talk to the detectives... Talking has worked so far. SIRENS - That's Detective Gibbs. - Why are they going that way? Let's find out. Mani, Mani, Mani! If they find him, I want to be there. KNOCK AT DOOR Little fella asleep yet? Yeah, almost. I've put the kettle on. You want one? Yeah. I don't hate you as much as the other cops. You might get a biscuit with your tea, then. THUD OUTSIDE, DOG BARKS Wait here. Rob. Rob! GUNSHOT, BABY WHIMPERS Police! Down! - Weren't you just robbed? - No. - You didn't call triple O? - Not with this. Someone cut it. Shit. SIREN SOUNDS PHONE RINGS Tommy, call me back. The petrol station was a ruse. We think Corey's on his way. You've gotta get Leah and the baby out now. Where are they going? Aye, aye, aye. Slow down! They'll notice us. SIREN FADES Now we've lost them. You shouldn't have told me to slow down. His partner's not answering either. I don't like this. Leah... where are ya? I'm not gonna hurt ya, Leah. I just wanna meet my little boy. HEAVY BREATHING PHONE RINGS He's here. He's killed 'em. The cops. I heard him shoot 'em. Where are you? We need an ambulance to 13 Whealing Street... - I'm in the shed, with Hunter. - Where's Corey? I don't know. She's in the shed. - He's gonna find us. - Tell us what's in the shed. Um... some of my Dad's old shit, a wheelbarrow. There's a window. There's a window on the side. How big's the window? Not big enough for him to get through. - Can you lock the door? - No, only from the outside. What about a barricade? Anything you can use? - Yeah. Hang on. - BABY CRIES - I've done it. - Good girl. BABY CONTINUES CRYING Is that Hunter, Leah? You've got to keep him quiet. - Try feeding him. - I can't. Yes, you can. Just stay calm. We are on our way. Come on, mate. Drink up. Drink up, please. Leah? Leah! Come on, sweetheart, I just wanna meet my little boy. Give me your gun. - What? - I'm on restricted duties. Richard locked mine up. - What am I meant to do? - You stay here. I'm not staying here. We need to wait for back-up. No, we shouldn't. Maybe you should have it. No. Stay close. Leah, I just wanna talk to ya. Leah Baxter! I just wanna talk to you. Leah? EDUARDO: That's their car. I just wanna see my boy, Leah. BABY CRIES Leah... Leah, open the door, Leah. Leah. Come on, sweetheart, open the door. Leah! Open the fucking door, Leah! DOGS BARKING Oh, we're not going any further. Fuck! Stop it, Corey! (WHISPERS) Leah! Give me the bub. Leave the blanket. - What? - Just do exactly what I say. You've gotta trust me. Open the fucking door! Drop your guns! You called the fuckin' cops, didn't ya? Get the fuck out here now! Leah, get out here now. CHARLIE: Corey, drop your guns. Move. Are you gonna shoot your own son? Is that what you want? Move. What the... Mani? Mani, put that down. - Who the fuck are you? - You don't remember me? You put a gun to my head four days ago! - Mani. Whoa, whoa. - And you killed her. - Who? Mani, he didn't kill Bo-Lin. We know who did. It wasn't him. I'll explain everything later but you need to put the gun down. Do what she says, Mani. Come on, Mani. He's not worth it. He started all of this. He's ruined so many lives, including Bo-Lin's. There you go. That's it. All right? Where is he? Where... Hey! Hey. You caught him. Yeah, we did. Corey Baxter's done a lot of terrible things. But we know he wasn't at the warehouse with Bo-Lin. You want us to keep collecting evidence, or is there something you want to tell us? It all just kept building, one horrible thing after another. The day you didn't get a promotion, you went back to the store. I saw a gun, a balaclava. I thought Bo-Lin was him. I tackled her. And the gun went off. He was dead. Anna, why didn't you just arrest her? As a police officer, you did the right thing. Tony's death was an accident. Everyone would think I was going crazy. Seeing Corey Baxter everywhere I went, and... And Bo-Lin, she was... she was so scared. I wanted to help her. I never meant to hurt her. We had an argument. And I pushed her, but I never meant for her to fall. I know. Hey. It's okay. And Bo-Lin's letter? You left that for us to find? I want Mani to read it. I want him to know how much she loved him, and that she never meant for any of this to happen. Come on. Let's go downstairs. Do you want some tea? Yeah. Yeah. Your name is all over the news. We are so proud of you. Our son put that man behind bars. What will happen to Anna? - She'll go to jail. - Ah, she is a good person. They will take that into account. Maybe we could look after George some days. Remember how good you were with him, hmm? He is a beautiful baby. I could help you. Thank you, Mum. That'd be nice. - Hey! - Hi, Dad. - Hello, sweetheart, how are you? - Yeah, I'm good. - Is Penny really making pancakes? - She is. You have the best time, okay? I want to hear all about it. Bye, baby. - You wanna go wash your hands? - Okay. Congratulations. You got Baxter. Yeah, we did. Finally over. Yeah, it is. The rest of Bo-Lin's letter. There was more. Constable Jamison didn't destroy it. Thank you. Bo-Lin's parents have asked for her body to be returned to China. I understand. We've still got our own goodbye plans. Would you like to come? Okay. BO-LIN: If for some reason we can't meet up again, I want you to do something for me. Promise me you will swim in our waterhole every day. Even in winter. And when you jump in, I want you to remember us. Remember how much I love you, Mani, and how much I will keep loving you, no matter where I am. - Did you steal my chip? - Yup. - What's wrong with yours? - Yours looked better. - Could you ask next time? - No.
