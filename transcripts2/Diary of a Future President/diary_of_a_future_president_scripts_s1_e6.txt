 Diary, as usual, Bobby was chill. - Cool racket. - It was my dad's. Uh... - I'm sorry. - It's chill. Mami was thrilled to be tackling her big case at work. Cases like Waveline are why I got into law. It's exactly the kinda of passion I'm looking for in my number two. Congratulations. - You're perfect for that case. - Aw. And in my quest for justice... I messed things up.

 You lied about your period? And landed myself in my worst-case scenario. Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. Nelson Mandela was jailed for 27 years. And because of my efforts, my sentence was one week of detention. Surrounded by kids who were... how do I put this? The worst of the worst. These were the Six O' Clockers. Coined because detention lasts until the late bell at six. Take Kris P. for example. I heard she's a witch who tried to put a hex on Mr. Heller. Everyone knows Calvin comes from a family of bank robbers, and he's the getaway driver, even though he's 11. There's Dylan, who's a total klepto.

 I think his most recent victim was a Parisian musician. And then, there's... Belinda. Don't get me started. I heard Belinda set Dr. Cooper's car on fire. Yeah. He had to go on Extreme Makeover: Car Edition. But his episode's so depressing, they keep it in the vault. I don't belong with the Six O' Clockers. I'm Joan of Arc, not Jack the Ripper. Eat your tostada, Joan of Arc. Hey, Elena. Good luck ever getting into college now that you're a Six O' Clocker. Elena, everyone knows that you're not a Six O' Clocker. This is just a blip. Yeah, you're right. No one would ever lump me in with those kids. Plus, it's not on my permanent record. I checked. Oh, thank God. Yeah, so Waveline joined a bigger suit with a bunch of other hotel groups repped by a huge New York firm. We couldn't handle a case that size, even if we wanted to. Right. I'm really sorry, Gab. Waveline was lucky to have you for as long as they did. Do you need a Sam-wich? Oh, Sam. Hmm? Come on? Maybe a bite. All right. Hey, Gam. You are looking at our new HR captain. And as my first duty, I present to you the official manual on office relationships. Please read and sign so you can be HR offish. Craig, everyone in the office knows we're together. Do we really need to do this? Office policy. Ooh! They said I would need to say that, and yeah, feels good. And then there's a ten-minute crying scene, and the camera shakes the whole time. I swear, this film has everything. That sounds like the worst movie of all time. Exactly! That's what makes it a cult classic. Because you're forced to watch it against your will? Wait. So the mailbox comes to life? Oh, yeah. Special Delivery is canon. It's so bad, it's good. Wanna watch it at my place this week? - Hard no. - Yeah, not gonna happen. You guys don't get art. I gotta walk Monyca with a Y to pre-algebra. Ziggy, stay strong. Does the mailbox eat mail? Does junk mail make him fatter? What? Elena, carpool pickup is that way. You know I'm not going home. Oh, right! You got detention for chucking orange juice at me like a weirdo. I said I was sorry. I gotta go. Melissa, you're hilarious! - You must join us for a cup of tea. - Oh. Hey, Melissa. We're getting spicy mocha blend whips, right? I only caffeinate with people I trust. So, I did all my homework. I organized my backpack twice. Wow. I love this pen. Pen, pen, pen, pen, pen. The ink is blocked. Diary, I've run out of tasks. Guess I only have one option. - I once put a fork in the microwave. - What? It started a small fire. You know... fire. You knock over one Bunsen burner and suddenly the whole school thinks you're a pyromaniac. Oh. Wait, what? I don't love fire any more than anyone else. I'm just a little clumsy. I'm sorry. I guess I fell for a stupid rumor. It's okay. We know everyone talks about us. And just to get it out there, Kris P. never put a hex on anyone. This is just my look. And I'm not a getaway driver. Eczema. Hand eczema. To be honest, I do steal things sometimes. But my therapist says I'm acting out because of my parents' divorce. And I always return what I steal. Sorry. Wow. I was totally wrong about all of you guys, except Dylan. Try it out. You unclogged the blockage! Wait, so, if you didn't set a car on fire, why are you in detention? My mom works nights, and because of her schedule, I'm always 12 minutes late to school. Yeah, she always misses morning announcements. I never know the special snack of the day. Oh, Elena, you have insider information. What's the special snack tomorrow? Can't tell you that. Pears. So, yeah. We're all in here for stupid reasons. Don't worry. It's not on our permanent records. I checked. I hear permanent records aren't even real. They're not? Yeah, they were made up by cartoons to scare kids. My uncle told me. He's a bumper boat mechanic at Torpedo Cove. That's so cool. My brother had his tenth birthday at Torpedo Cove. You know what, Diary? The Six O' Clockers are just like you and me. Well, not you. You're a diary. Oh, Elena! Hey. Wow, you guys look great in this light. Yeah, those detention fluorescents don't do anyone favors. Is that Ms. Thomas's shoe? Yeah, the heel's a little wobbly, but I'm almost there. Wanna try some banana bread? I made it myself. Oh, my God. This is marvelous. Magnificent. Miraculous. Crap, I forgot about the M's quiz! Oh. BRB. I want more when I get back. Come sit with us. You've gotta try this banana bread, it's... Elena, what are you doing? I thought you weren't Jack the Ripper. They're not either. I swear, they're actually really cool once you get to know them. Come on. No, I gotta go to math tutoring. I just came here to grab a pear. And listen, I... I'm sure they're nice and all, but... But what? You don't want people to start thinking that you're a Six O' Clocker too. What's gonna happen to me? Jessica's gonna make fun of me? She already does. All I'm saying is, be careful, Elena. And you're playing with fire. That's just a rumor! And then my dad said, "There's no way to watch TV and do homework at the same time." But it's called multitasking. Do you ever get just so pissed off at your dad? Oh. Uh, he doesn't really chime in too much. That's cool. Quiet dad. I guess you get in less arguments that way. Yeah, he's definitely pretty quiet. What else? - Um... - Ooh! We should get smoothies this week and talk all about our families. I'm free tomorrow. Oh, man. I would, but... I already told Danny I'd watch this dumb movie at his place. Ever heard of Special Delivery? Oh, God. That movie's supposed to be horrible. Yeah, that's kinda the point. It's a cult classic. So, I guess another time? Yeah, another time. And that is why it is absolutely necessary that we all wear seat belts. Great argument as always, Elena. Well-stated, to the point. Now for the rebuttal. Rashmi. Sure, my opponent gave a compelling argument. But can we really believe her so-called facts? I mean, she's a Six O' Clocker. She sat with them at lunch. And everyone knows Six O' Clockers can't be trusted. True. Diary, did my debate opponent just discredit me in front of the entire class, including the love of my life, Joey Feldstein? Rashmi, Elena's... newfound reputation has nothing to do with the credibility of her argument. Sorry, Mr. Bates. I'll continue. Seat belt safety is a myth because, according to my research and observations... Hey, ready to tackle this manual? I heard the book's better than the movie. Really, Sam? Let's just sign the thing and move on. "Sign it and move on." You graduated from law school. You passed the bar. You've been practicing law for years, only to sign something without reading it first? Yeah. This thing is... That is not the Gabi I know. That is not the lawyer I know. Ugh, fine. Let's just speed-read. Ooh! Section 1A, "Realistic Discretion." Elena! You're not gonna try to get me to sit with the Six O' Clockers again, are you? No. And don't call them that. We're fine here. Okay, good. Because I wanna tell you about last night's Broomsbriar. It was the third night of the full moon, which was also pledge week. And Lucindissa finally... "And at the first signs of attraction, one must consider whether or not an office relationship would be beneficial for both parties." "First sign of attraction." You know what? I remember the moment I fell for you. You do? When was it? But what was yours? I don't know. It was a gradual process. Lots of moments. Mm-hmm. Mine was the day of the Palm Coast Estates presentation. It was a year ago. And I remember every minute. I was having the worst couple of weeks. I'd just been fired by this pretty high-profile client, and I was having trouble finding my sea legs at the new firm. To make matters worse, I'd gotten the number 14 all over my shirt. I was so intimidated by you at that meeting. When you spoke, you were just so... Gabi. Smart, prepared, magnetic. I'd never seen you do your thing, and I was blown away. You had the room in the palm of your hand. The Palm Coast of your hand. - Sam... - I know. I'm sorry. It was right there. And then I had to follow you. And I felt like crap and I looked like it. The last thing I wanted to do was talk in front of a bunch of people when I felt like maybe I wasn't cut out for this. But then I looked at you. And you smiled. And you were telling me you thought I could do it. And I believed you. That was the moment. Hey, everyone. Back under the ol' fluorescents. Dylan, do you have my earring? Dylan, my man! You're a maniac. A kleptomaniac! What? We joke about Dylan. That's our thing. Why did you ignore us at lunch? Oh... My friend, Sasha. See, we love this show, Broomsbriar Academy, and she wanted to fill me in because there was a warlock frat party... We get it. You don't wanna be seen in public with us. No, that's not true. We're friends. But just in here. Not in front of anyone else, right? It's just, I didn't expect detention to affect how people see me. I did not mean it like that. I'm sorry. Whatever, Elena. This movie is so terrible, but somehow I can't stop laughing. I told you. Watch this next part. It's hilarious. That postal truck came out of nowhere. Daddy! It's okay, son. It's okay. It's my time. Curse you, postal service! I'm never sending a letter ever again! Don't worry, son. I'll find a way to return... ...to sender. No! Diary, I feel terrible. I alienated my new friends. Now I'm right back where I started. Sitting in detention, alone with my pen. That Dylan fixed. Pen. Pen. Pen. Pen. Okay, it's six o' clock. You're dismissed. See everyone tomorrow. Except Elena. What? But I was supposed to serve a whole week. Four days for good behavior. Aren't you happy, Elena? You got what you wanted. Yeah, congrats. You're not a Six O' Clocker anymore. She never was. Hey, so, just wondering... how has my behavior been better than Belinda's? Or Kris P.'s? Or anyone else's? Come on, Elena. We both know you'll never be back here. Where the hell did I put my shoe? Wait, wait. So the dad's spirit left his body and turned into a mailbox? Yes! Keep watching. It gets even funnier. Look, Dad. All A's. That's my boy. That's my boy. I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. This mailbox has gotta go. You can't! This mailbox is my dad! No can do, kid. E-mail's coming. No, Dad. No! Hey, you split pretty quick after the movie ended. Yeah, I had to get home. My mom was blowing up my phone. You seemed kinda off, and I just wanted to check if everything was cool. My dad died right before I got to middle school. Whoa. - Bobby, I'm... - It's chill. You know, I try not to think about it too much. Why would Danny push Special Delivery? Doesn't he know about your dad? I don't know. Danny and Ziggy are my boys, but it's, sort of, just never come up. Do you wanna talk about it? Nah. I'm good for now. Well, if you ever wanna, I'm here. Hey, how was the movie? So funny. Congrats on getting out of detention. - Thanks, I guess. - You must be so happy now that you don't have to spend your afternoons with the Six O' Clockers. You don't get it, Claude. Okay. Sorry. I just felt a burst of hives on my ankle. I was in there. I know the Six O' Clockers. People just don't understand! Sorry I scared you. I just wish everyone knew the truth. I'll be right back. Wait, where are you going? We're on in five. Thank you, five. And that was my reenactment of a hurricane. She's still not back yet! Keep vamping. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Oh, thank God. Now for lunch and stuff. Sorry, I'm exactly 12 minutes late. Welcome to homeroom, Belinda. Before I get into today's lunch, I have some things I wanted to say that I want everyone in the school to hear. I just wanted to say that I'm a Six O' Clocker. But that's not a bad thing to be. I thought it was, but then in detention, I got to know the Six O' Clockers. They're really cool. And none of the things you think about them are true. So instead of believing stupid rumors like I used to, I've compiled a list of super true, super fun facts. So, Calvin. He's really funny. And no one in his family is a bank robber. But his uncle does work at Torpedo Cove. Boy, does Calvin have stories about the bumper boat lagoon. If you go in the water, your skin falls off. He has pictures. Then there's Kris P. She's not a witch, except in the kitchen, where she bakes a wicked banana bread. So if any of you have any rotten bananas, help her out. Give 'em to Kris P. And Dylan, he's so resourceful. If he steals anything of yours, he always gives it back. And in better condition. You can subtract now. Wow. Thanks? And then there's Belinda. She welcomed me into the Six O' Clockers with open arms, even though I didn't make the greatest first impression. She's so nice, you guys. We could all use a friend like Belinda. And also Dr. Cooper has had the same Tercel since my adult cousin went here, so clearly no one set his car on fire. And finally, it's time to dispel the rumor about permanent records. They're not a real thing. Cut to black! Cut to black! Special snack is still pears. Bye! Mm-hmm. "In conclusion, office relationships can be convenient and fulfilling..." - "Fulfilling." - "...but must follow the proper protocol." We did it. We read every word. Let's sign this stupid manual. "Stupid manual"? You insisted we spend all this time reading it. You were feeling down. Wait, what? The Waveline thing sucks. That case was made for you. I hated seeing you so upset, so I thought this would take your mind off it. I just wanna make you happy, Gab. You know what? I just thought of my moment. Oh. You mean your "first sign of attraction" to me? No. The moment I fell in love with you. It's right now. - Wait, are you saying... - I'm saying I love you. Well, I'm saying I love you too. Hey, everyone. This is my BFFAESNSOTBFBU, Sasha. Sasha, this is everyone. - Hi. - Hey. Can I have a slice of banana bread? - Oh, yeah. - You're gonna love it. - It's really good, yeah. - I've been hyped out. It's gonna be great. It's, like, my second time baking, duh. Diary, at the end of the day, someone is only a stranger because you haven't met them yet. Do you have, like, a secret ingredient or something? See if you can figure it out. - Oh, my gosh. - This is really good. But that stranger could be a friend. Maybe even a friend who can fix something when it breaks. Like my pen. Pen. Pen. Pen. You get it.
