But, uh, I've always been a Scooba fan. Uh, I also help, uh, during the games, home games, uh, on the chain crew.

 It's a job that I enjoy. Uh, I'd rather watch a JUCO game, than I had a SEC game, or, you know, because, uh, a lot of these guys I know... personally. I go down there and work on their dorms. They have trouble and I go down there, and help 'em out, and, uh... I don't mind. I give 'em my phone number. "Hey, if y'all have problems, gentlemen, I'm right across the road from ya." And, uh, I get to watch 'em go up to bigger schools, and I get to watch 'em go on up into pro. And, um... It's just a great experience in my life. And, uh... And I love my job. I love what I do. And I have a lot of school spirit. I wouldn't go anywhere else if I had a chance. Uh, I just love it here. [Wood] If you look at one of the pillars in our locker room in there, it talks about the horse. And it describes how God describes the horse. {\an8}And here's what it says when he describes the horse. {\an8}This is him talking to Job. He says, "Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane? Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting? He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray. He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing. In frenzied excitement, he eats up the ground. He cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds." That's how the horse is built. Now, if God'll make the horse to do that... the horse conquers things. What about you? What can you conquer? What can you do? All right. That's it, kinda, on the lesson with that. Wanna tie it back into, uh, us from a football standpoint. This came out today... in The Clarion-Ledger. "Co-Lin draws early nod as the MACJC favorite. Despite back-to-back title runs for East Mississippi, Co-Lin has drawn a lot of pre-season praise. While it does seem odd for East Mississippi not to be the favorite, considering their unprecedented run, the Wolfpack is loaded." -[DJ scoffs] -[indistinct chatter] [players chuckling] [Wood] Doesn't matter that you beat them twice last year, they don't care. The last loss we had was to Co-Lin in 2012. And the last two losses they've had came by us last year. Now, get your head on what's important. Make sure you're paying attention. Make sure, off the field, that you're working on being a better person. We talk about that all the time, too. Make sure you're the guy that's built to last. You understand what I'm talking about? All right. Let's roll. Let's watch what we got. {\an8}[radio host] Talking with EMCC head football coach, Buddy Stephens. And Coach, it was a good win, 69 to 20. It's, uh, 24 in a row. {\an8}Now, I know you don't like to concentrate on that-- {\an8}Hold on one second. Hold on one second. How many in a row? Okay. Well, I stopped it. I thought you meant for me to stop the interview.[laughs] [laughs] How many in a row? This is 24. -How many? Last week it was-- -25, 25, 25-- There you go. Um, hey, all I'm doing... all I'm doing is protecting you. -[radio host laughs] -You know that. I'm... I'm taking care of you. Hey, it's only week two, right? Yeah, we're good. [chuckles] We're good. Hey, it may not... It may not get to 26, the way we're talking about it. {\an8}[interviewer] How did you get your own room? {\an8}Oh, this is part of... one of the things that, I, uh, like, you know... that came with me coming here. You know, making sure I stay by myself. That's all. -[John] I'm about to call Mom Dukes. -[phone beeping] I got to talk to her at least twice a day. [John's father] Hey, son. Move the laptop so you can see your mom? [laughs] Oh, I'm on the... Mom, what you messing with the camera for? {\an8}[John's mother] What am I supposed to touch? The mike? {\an8}-[John] No. -The camera thing? -Yeah. -Hold on. There it is. There it... Leave it alone now. [John's father] So what your coach done say about last night? [John chuckles] That he was happy. I was 15 for 24. I threw for 189 yards, had three touchdowns. And I ran four times for 40 yards. [John's mother] Yeah, the reception was... It wasn't crispy clear. [John's father] I could see you, son. I knew who my son was. [snickering] [John's father] I knew who my son was. That's all. Appreciate that, Pop. Appreciate it. [John's father] John emerged as a football player from Little League football. {\an8}He always was able to throw the ball... 30, 40 yards at 12 years old. So it was when he got to high school and the coach came up to him and said he wanted him to be the quarterback, the rest was just history. {\an8}We called him Showtime when he was here. {\an8}So, he's flashy, he's just like... he knows what he's trying to do. He knows where he's trying to go. And he does it. [girl 1] Showtime. That was his nickname. [girl 2] Mmm-hmm. 'Cause every time he got on the field, he'd put on a show. -[all laughing] -[boy] Time to sit back and watch. Watch the show. -[gun cocks] -[Wyatt] Let it rip on it. -I hit it. It just didn't fall over. -[man laughs] [indistinct chatter] [Wyatt] They wanna see how long I been comin' here. That's me. [man] That's before he ever had a driver's license. [laughter] {\an8}[Steve] Going into his sophomore season, {\an8}Wyatt thought he was going to be the starting quarterback and maybe bring a freshman in. So... we hear rumblings and Twitter, and all of a sudden, John Franklin III shows up. John's a great athlete. Uh, a better athlete than Wyatt, hands down. You know, I contacted the coaching staff and said, "You know what, it's probably time to make a move." And about a day and a half later, Wyatt called me at home and said, "You know, Coach Buddy met with me and Marcus, and... I'm gonna stay and fight for the job." [player] Twenty-three lock key. [Wyatt] Competition doesn't do nothing but make the best out of you. See what you're made of. You're gonna crumble under it, or you're gonna succeed under it. So, uh, you know, it's just been-- It's still... I mean, it's still a battle. You know, we're still... They're still undecided on who's the starter. [player 1] Ready, set! [Buddy] Move, move, move, move! [player 2] Ball! [Wood] There you go. -[Buddy] Get up field! -[whistle blowing] [indistinct yelling] [Buddy] Get your feet underneath you! Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving! -[whistle blows] -[Wood] Good job, good job! Way to use your legs! Way to use your legs! [Buddy] Good job, John! [Wood] You see a guy like Wyatt Roberts, who maybe didn't have the height, {\an8}maybe didn't have the speed that this one has, or that one has, but has that "it" factor that he brings to the table. Then you drop a guy like John in the mix, and, uh, what he brings to the table with his athleticism alone, not to mention his ability to throw. So, yeah, we're hashing all that out right now. [Buddy] Get out! Get out! [Wood] Go! Fall! -[whistle blows] -[Wood] Ahhh! Put it on him. Put it on him. Not here. Put it on him. Keep it off the ground. Keep it off the ground. Good ball, bad ball, catch it all. Let's go. [indistinct chatter] "Exam one." You had a test? [Ollie] I had a test? -I'm asking you. -Uh-uh. [music playing through headphones] Could you turn the music off so you could hear what I'm saying? I'm hearing. I'm listening. {\an8}[Marcel] Pop quiz. [Ollie] Damn! {\an8}-[Wagner] What class? -Miss-- {\an8}-Comp 2? -[Ollie] Yes. Okay, get it out. Do you have it? 'Cause you have class in 30 minutes. And it's 33 questions. Uh-uh, I can't... Uh-uh. -I can't take that right now. -I need... You gotta turn that off. I got it... It... it helps me concentrate. -[music continues] -[slurps] It's The Weeknd. [Wagner] I found with several of our players, they get here, and they're not conditioned to do school. They're not conditioned to go to class. They're not conditioned to sit in there the whole time. They're not conditioned to turn in their work. Their focus, their whole life, has been on, "You're gonna be good at football." Okay, let's go over The Most Dangerous Game really, really quick. Who wrote it? -[boys laughing] -[Ollie] It's over with. [Marcel] Yeah. We gotta leave for class. Do y'all know the two main characters? [Ollie and Marcel] Yeah, uh, Rainsford and the general. -[Wagner] General Zaroff. -[boys] Yeah. And when Zaroff tells them that he hunts humans, he acts like that's the craziest thing ever. He's a murderer. But then, the irony in that is that Zaroff turns to Rainsford, he says, "Okay, well, do it one time with me. Let's do it one time with me." -[Ollie mutters] -So they go out, and they have this game where they hunt each other, and Rainsford ends up getting, like, an adrenaline rush -and liking it. -Yeah. So they end up doing it. Rainsford ends up killing... Zaroff. -...the bodyguard. What's his name? -The big dude... Uh... [Ollie stammers] The big... the big dude who had the gun pointed to him and-- [Wagner] Yep. He ends up killing his-- Zeus. Zeus. -[Wagner] No. -It's some Zoo, Zip... [Marcus] Zing, or something. [Wagner] Ask her when you walk in, what the bodyguard's name is. He kills all the dogs. Rainsford ends up winning the hunt. And then ends up getting addicted to, basically, murdering people. -Oh, that's... that's tight. -[boy] So, he does the same thing? Dang, we should've finished it. [indistinct chatter] Do you have a pencil? Maybe. Maybe not. [John whispering] Oh, why'd I do that? [CJ] Oh, my gosh. Pick the ball up. What? Oh, my... That spin never works. -I'm about to get hot, for real. -[chuckles] [John] This is how we entertain ourselves. 'Cause there ain't nothing to do in Scooba, at all. {\an8}-So... -All we have is Subway and a... {\an8}a chicken place. [John] I went to the number one party school in the country. So it was a lot of fun for me. This is the party right now. Yeah, homie. Yeah... yeah, we're the party. [CJ] It isn't that much to do, but it is football heaven. That's why we came here, you know. He just got his first offer yesterday. Yeah, I just got an offer yesterday by West Virginia, you know. The dream offer is LSU, though. That is my dream. I've been talking to Auburn a lot. Talked to them this morning. They say this is supposed to be the biggest game. -Co-Lin. -Yeah. They're, like, one of the best JUCOs, too, in Mississippi. Yeah. -Quote, unquote. -Quote, unquote. So, we'll see. [interviewer] You guys nervous? -Never nervous. -Never. [both laughing] [Wyatt] Ready, set. [grunts] [indistinct chatter] {\an8}[Wyatt] If I get a good offer, I'm not-- I can't pass up then obviously I'm gonna take it. And then if not, I'm just gonna go to Mississippi State, and, uh... play some intramural ball or somethin', and finish out my education and get to work, you know. 'Cause you gotta face reality sometime. You know, you can't just play football the rest of your life. I mean, some people can, but... and that's a great thing to do, but, you know, most of us got to go to work. So you gotta start thinking about that sometime. [Buddy] Oh, we got it! We got it! We got it! [player] Ready, set, hut! [Buddy] Good... Oh, shit. [whistle blowing] [DJ] I'm tryin' to go to Florida. They said they liked it, they like me, so... we'll see how that works out. -They give you an offer yet? -Uh-uh. Not yet. Where you got one to? I got Louisville, Ole Miss, West Virginia. We gotta write that paper. Um... UAB. Who else? And that's it for right now. Ole Miss, West Virginia, Louisville, UAB, and that's it. Four. -What paper? -For... -Miss Rose? -Yeah. We got a paper? [man] How much do you know about DJ Law? [Wagner laughs] {\an8}-Well, I better know a lot about him, huh? -Yes, ma'am. {\an8}He's the most highly recruited player in the country, I think. Um... He's gonna be a guy that's gonna come down to the last grade being put in the computer as to whether-- What's he like, personality-wise? What's he like? He's got a great personality. He is always happy, always smiling. Um, he's been through a lot. -He's got a troubled past and childhood. -Right. -He has never been disrespectful to me. -Got you. You know, "Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am." Flipside of that, um, he may or may not do what I tell him to do. -He may or may not respond to a text. -Right. He may or may not go to class. He's one of those guys, too, that was so good. I mean, I don't know that he's ever really... You know, in high school I think he was just kind of allowed to do whatever. I mean, he's a guy that-- He's just a product of... -the environment that he's been in. -His talent has, uh, made him have to... allowed him to be absent of his responsibility. Yeah. But, when he gets there, do you feel like he can do the work? I feel like he can do it. Yeah. -Now, he needs-- He'll need help. -Right. I mean, he needs help, he needs encourage-- He's not a guy that really responds to negativity. When you see him, you let him know Southeastern is waiting on him. All right. I will. [Wagner] Grade reports are due Friday. This is, like, the first indicator of how everybody is doing. I may panic myself, but I don't want the athletes to panic. If they see me panicking this early, and then they panic, nine times out of ten... they're gonna just quit. I have a feeling I'm gonna be panicking about DJ Law. He's got some absences. That makes me panic. If he gets dropped from classes, then he won't... he can't play. And we need him. I mean, he's a key player. So if he gets dropped... He cannot get dropped. And for DJ, like, he can't do that. The National Championship really is right there. That's prime recruiting for Division I football. If they're gonna have any chance of making it when they leave here, they just need to learn the lesson that, you know, just do what you're supposed to do. I never, ever saw myself in a place like Scooba, honestly. My, kind of, mantra has always been, "Put me where I'm most effective." Like, put me at the place where I can impact people the most. And I think, right now, this is it for me. I'm impacting more college football players at East Mississippi Community College than I ever, in a million years, could dream I could do. With my personal life, am I happy? [groans] You know, it probably hasn't gone the way that I wanted it to go. And I mean, I really don't have a whole lot of a personal life. And then you have the whole aspect of having a child. I think it's very important for children to be on a schedule and feel like life is stable. Especially in her situation, where her parents, you know, got a divorce, and then her dad moved away. You know, I mean, I think I'm a very successful single mom, and hopefully... it won't be like this forever. [chuckles] -[Wagner] Love you. -Love you, too. Sleep good. Okay. [kissing] I'm gonna turn the air down. It's hot in here right now, but I'm gonna turn the air down, okay? -Okay. -All right. Night-night. -Night. -[kisses] [indistinct chatter on TV] [phone ringing] Chad Kelly. [ringing stops] What up, dog? {\an8}Hey, man, what's up? {\an8}[Chad] Not much. What's up with you? {\an8}[laughs] Congratulations getting named starter, baby. I did, yeah. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. I just gotta go out there and do my thing. That's it. Hey, I know that, uh, I know that there's been a lot of people calling, a lot of people text you and everything. Just wanted to call and tell you how proud we are for you, okay? All right, I appreciate it. Hey, I watched the game. Y'all looked pretty good, man. I thought the quarterbacks looked good, huh? We're gonna kind of switch it around a little bit this week and let, uh, John Franklin go first, and let Wyatt go second. Really still trying to find out who "the guy" is. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, y'all have Co-Lin this week? Yeah, we got Co-Lin at their place this week. All right. Well, go do that work. -See you, man. All right, bye. -All right. All right, Coach. Bye. That's good. He learned he was the starting quarterback at Ole Miss. [stutters] He's made a few bad decisions, you know, but he makes me very proud. Very, very proud. Proud for him, proud for where he's come, you know, and how far he's gone. Very, very proud. [Chad] The guy that first introduced me to JUCO football was Coach Stephens. He called me on my cell phone and said, um, "I think there's an opportunity here." And the day that all the stuff kinda hit ESPN, they said, "Hey, come take a visit." {\an8}[reporter 1] Police arrested Chad Kelly over the weekend, {\an8}the nephew of Bills hall-of-famer Jim Kelly. [reporter 2] Now, if he wants to continue his football career, he'll have to search for a new college willing to take him. There's reasons why you're there, and it isn't just to play football. It's to better yourself on and off the field. {\an8}[crowd cheering] {\an8}He said, "If you come, we'll win the National Championship." And things worked out perfectly. [chuckles] [indistinct shouting] No matter what level it is, to go out there and actually do it and win it is the greatest feeling ever. [Buddy] This place was really a place to revamp his public image. 'Cause sometimes when they come here, they're working on their last chance, and this is a chance for them to step forward and make people believe in 'em again. [crowd cheering] {\an8}It's obviously worked, you know. {\an8}I mean, I don't pretend to know exactly how he does it. The great high school quarterback who didn't qualify, and came here, and went on to Ole Miss. And then you get another kid, leaves Arkansas State to come here because he wants to go somewhere bigger, and then he becomes the starting quarterback at Ole Miss. [crowd cheering] [Jubera] And they have their best season in forever. [announcer] They're rushing the field. Bo Wallace wants to keep that football. [Jubera] They want a place that's gonna send them on. And that's what this place is kind of proven to be. {\an8}[Buddy] We've had a legacy. Seven straight all-American quarterbacks. It's what we do, you know. And I think the one we've got coming up may be better than all of them. [John] I learned a lot while I was in Tallahassee, {\an8}but I came here and, you know, I'm getting a chance to play. {\an8}And, uh, I'm finding my love for it again. Everybody looking forward to me to blow it up like I normally do. [exhales] Especially Coach Stephens. He done said it about ten times this week, from Sunday already, so... [chuckles] [Buddy] I need you to be better. I need you to be better at everything you do. Period. Okay? This bunch, this week will come after your ass on this now. Okay? They will put... they will put eight guys down here -that will come after your ass. -[John] Ready, set. -[Trickett] Ball! -[man] I like it. I like that. -[whistle blows] -[indistinct chatter] [DJ] Good ball. Good ball, John. I'm diming today. I dime every day. Thinkin' about a little black-white-black. Little skull and bones, little black pants, little white shirt. Which white jersey? I like the chrome one. -All in white? Okay. -Which-- I like that one. And if we do that, we gotta go white undershirt. Yeah, okay. -What do you think? -It'll look good. Or you could go black. You could go white, white. Solid white with a black helmet. [Wood] Copiah-Lincoln's our next opponent. Uh, Co-Lin's a very good football team. Uh, we're ranked number one in one of the polls. And then, another one of the polls has them ranked number one. So, uh... I don't wanna say it's bad blood between anybody necessarily, but our last loss was to Co-Lin. [announcer] ...at the one-yard line, and EMCC's season is over. So, yeah. To say it's a... to say it's a big deal to us? That'd be an understatement. -[indistinct chatter] -[Buddy] Hurry up! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get set! Get set! Get set! Snap the damn thing! No, no, no. Blow the whistle! Blow the whistle. -Blow the whistle. -[whistle blowing] All right, guys. Get your ass in fucking step! [shouting] Quit moving in and out, and get fucking set! [CJ] Let's go, let's go, let's go. [Buddy] Make sure everybody's set, Rea. -[CJ] Right, right, right. -[whistle blows] [John] They made cream for that. Hey, how you... [whispering] Hey, friend. What's up, friend? She got me. I ain't talkin' about that. [John] What up, friend? [woman whispering] [John] I don't wanna talk about that right now. I'm just trying to say what's up. You in the crew now, so you know what I'm saying? Damn... You know, you're my friend now, so I'm gonna say what's up. Strike one. Practice tomorrow at 3:15. [laughing] What's your goal... this year? To leave as quick as possible? [all laughing] -I mean, I just-- -Oh, that's so sad. I just came from Florida State, so I don't know where I'm gonna go after this. Ah, so you just came. Okay. Are you planning on going back? No. You got a girlfriend? [John] Wait. What'd you say? Do you got a girlfriend? No. I ain't got no girlfriend. You on camera now. I ain't got no girlfriend.

It's aggressive, and... girls like that, mostly. [all laughing] Like, I don't know. It's, like, a masculine sport. And when they think of football, they just think of... cute, muscular guys. -Yeah. -So... {\an8}[girl 2] I like number one. {\an8}-[girl 1] Ooh. -[all laughing] {\an8}[girl 2] Like, I was really trying to see who he was. And that's why I looked him up on the, um... Internet. -[all laughing] -Stalker. [girl 2] They going all the way. [girl 3] Yeah. [girl 2] Like, number one. [girl 4] They win Nationals.

Listen up. We've got some things we've gotta fix. I wanna go over two things. Grayson, he was trying to smuggle a... [stammers] He was trying to smuggle a girl out of his room. [players laughing] J-5 was not even trying to smuggle, [stammering] he was clearly running for the border. All right. So, hey, let me say this. I say that laughingly, and it's jokingly, and all that, but here's your warning, okay? We-- We say all that to give you a warning. I'm not mad at them, but I'm telling you right now, if you get caught, you're gonna get a $300 fine. And ain't nothing Coach Stephens gonna be able to do to you. Hey, I'm telling ya now... Hey, I mean it. If you get caught... if you get caught... by... listen to me. If you get caught by campus police, they're gonna give you a $300 ticket. $300. You can go up here to the Western Motel, and get $45, pay $45. Three of you can split it, $45, and each of you get, like, eight hours a piece -in the motel room. -[all laughing] All right? So... and it don't cost you but $15. All right? So... it's a lot easier than paying a $300 fine, that's gonna go on there, and you're gonna have to pay it before you get your grades. [Wagner] It's just a female with a body part... -[John] No. No. -...to you. You don't think. That's as far as your thoughts go. "Oh, here's a female." What more is there to think about right now? It's a human being. -A person. -Okay. Like, a person with a brain and a heart, and feelings, and emotions, and... Well, all that was already established-- -All that was already... -That's all one side of it. On the other side of it, there's diseases and consequences, and all kinds of other stuff. Reputation, and just... whatever. There's a lot to think about. [sighs] I'm disappointed in you. -I'm sorry that I'm-- -You got her number on Tuesday, she came to your game on Thursday, and she gets caught in your room on... Friday. Like, come on. -I mean... -And now you're done with her. -I'm a college student-- -Terrible decision. -I'm a male football college athlete. -Don't matter. That's a terrible decision. I'm so sorry that I'm just living the life right now. Did you go to college once? -Did I do what? -Did you go to college once? I did go to college. Then why you, like, so disappointed? I don't get it. You know how this... you know how this shit go. Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Actually, I don't. [John] Hmm. You've been around college athletes for how long now? Seventeen years? Mmm-hmm. I been tryin' to make y'all make better decisions for 17 years. It's not gonna happen. It's the evolution of life. -It's... it's not really. -It's a stage. It is. I mean, I get what you're saying, but... All right. So let me go through my stage. Let me live my stage. I'm thinking about it from a female perspective. -I've been in Florida State for two years. -I know how these girls operate. Well, you still haven't told me what way it's disappointing. -That you would treat a woman like that. -So I have nothing to agree-- -Like, I don't... -What did I treat her like? I didn't dog the girl. I didn't put the girl's business out here. What did I treat her like? That's what I'm still confused on. -Are you in a relationship with her? -Hell no! Why would I be in a relationship with anybody from here when I'm leaving in a month? That just wastes everybody's time. That's just what happens in college nowadays, Miss Wagner. I'm sorry to break this shocking news to you. Like, you're acting so surprised, as if you've never known that this goes on in college. But I'm just sorry to have to be the person to break this to you. It happens. [players laughing] [indistinct chatter] -Line! -[blows whistle] Ollie, I said stay put! Stop, Ollie.

Rolling, 110. -[gasps] Huh? {\an8}How you roll this 110 depends upon how many more you got. -Let's roll. -Come on, Coach. -[blows whistle] -[grunting] Non-stop. If you don't stop, this'll be the last one. That's fucked up, Coach. It's fucked up that you missed my meeting and you missed breakfast and missed class. Yeah, there you go. [chuckles] There you go. You better not stop, man. I'm telling you. [Ollie] This shit's fucking torture, man. -[Williams muttering] -Coach, listen. Listen, I got a-- I got-- Coach, I got a 9:30, what's the point of waking up at seven? [Williams] If you hungry at night, you need to be hungry in the morning. All the way to the back of the end zone. [Ollie] Oh, come on, Coach, that's 120. [Williams] Roll all the way over here. I changed my mind, let's go. That fucked up. [sighs] Man, fuck! Fuck this shit. Man, I'm about drunk as hell. [player] Hey, your stomach feel empty and everything, don't it? [Ollie] Yo, man, that shit crazy. Make me wanna throw up or some shit. Man, fuck! Fuck this shit. [water splashing] Whoo! [player] Y'all think they gonna run that ball a lot? Hell no. They gonna throw it a lot, bro, 'cause they got a lot of good receivers. [indistinct chatter] Yeah, the tight end big as hell. He for real. I played against him in high school. He ain't... he ain't that good. {\an8}Fuck them. It's us versus you. They tryin' to kill you. {\an8}Yeah, I did try and kill him, but, like, at the end, if they die, like, when I hit them, bro, I won't be caring or nothin'. [Marcel] You hunt, or be hunted. Yes! -That what happened. -[Marcel] Dangerous Game. Dangerous Game. [Marcel] That was a good-ass story. [stammers] Hey... I ain't never... I ain't read a story like that in a while, man. Just in class. In class, I ain't never... [Marcel] It had my full attention. I didn't go to sleep or nothin'. Hey, on God, it did have my full attention. [Marcel] It had my full attention, bro. That was the first time, bro. In a minute. -[Ollie stammering] Hey, that's a good... -[stammering] That's a good story, bro. [indistinct chatter] [Jubera] Co-Lin is... It's a big game. Buddy's lost ten games, and three of them have been to these guys. [Wood] We always wanna chase history. But now, I... the streak itself, uh... if we can keep our focus right in front of us, and keep our eyes fixed, I think we're good to go. [cargo rattling] At the same time, we want them to realize, "Hey, you are in the middle of something historical, and you are having a chance to do something special. So, let's do it." Hey, listen. I got movies. I got... uh, Run All Night, Top Five and Big Game. -[player] Big Game. -Big Game. There you go. [player] Okay, all right. [loud explosion on TV] [indistinct chatter] Hey, send me John Franklin. Tell him to come here. [player] John Franklin. John Franklin. [John] If I fall, I'm suing this fucking bus company. [John meows] -How you doin', Mr. Franklin? -What's up, man? [John] What's up? [Buddy] Take them damn headphones off. Makes me think you're tryin' to listen to some other shit. Would you please run tonight like you stole some shit? [John] I got you. Last week you was runnin' like you scared you gonna get hit. Just go out and have fun. You hear me? Got you, Coach. Just go out and have fun and enjoy it. Don't talk too much. [indistinct shouting] [players chanting] [player] Y'all ready to shoot 'em up? [all] Shoot 'em up! [player] One shot! [all] One shot! [player] Two shots! [all] Two shots! [indistinct chanting] [Co-Lin player 1] That shit weak, boy! That shit weak! -[indistinct jeering] -[Co-Lin player 2] We got ya! -[Co-Lin player 1] Yeah! -[Co-Lin player 2] We got y'all! [indistinct jeering] Say your number, boy! Say your number! Deuce-five today! [Buddy] Hey, hey, hey! Get inside. Those dumbasses don't know how to act. Get inside, get inside. Go on. Get inside. Shit... Don't know how to act. [John] You know, they tried to do a little chantin', which was weak. You know, I was talking trash like I always do. They're gonna feel for... They're gonna pay for that. I promise y'all. I promise y'all, they're gonna pay for that. Every... I'm-- I'm trying to hold back, but I promise you, they're gonna pay for it. [marching band playing] [Buddy] Hey, you make sure, five, ten, fifteen years from now, they remember when they had to play your ass. You understand me? You make sure they remember. And the only way that's gonna happen is to leave an impression on 'em. You leave an impression on 'em by kicking their ass. [chanting] Go, Lions, go! {\an8}[announcer 1] This is a top five battle in the National JUCO standings. [announcer 2] EMCC averaging 49 points per contest in their winning streak of 25 games. The last team to knock EMCC off was this Co-Lin team. They're a team that can come in and beat you. [announcer 1] Well, I think the thing for EMCC is how're you gonna settle in at quarterback? We saw two guys have a very good game in week one. Are you gonna let them both back out there, or is somebody gonna take the hot hand? And if somebody gets hot, do you ride 'em? [announcer 2] So, the Lions, they wanna get started here. You know, when EMCC wins the toss, they take the football. [announcer 1] In the shotgun, it's gonna be John Franklin III, he's gonna hand the football off. And going up the middle is DJ Law, and he is wrestled around the 40-yard line. [Wood] Let's go! Heavy right! Heavy right! Hey, 32! {\an8}[announcer 2] Here's the snap, and John Franklin III gonna keep it himself, and this time, pocket collapses. Rolls to the right, now gonna tuck it. Franklin III fumbles the football around the 30-yard line, -and Co-Lin jumps on it. -[crowd cheering] -They think they have it. -Oh, my God. -And they do. -Get his ass fucking down! [Wood] Hurry up, hurry up! [Buddy] Don't do that shit! Go the fuck down! [indistinct shouting] God damn! [shouting] Sit down! I don't wanna hear, "That's on me." That's... that's two people. The snap and him. John, you're not the only player on the team. You go down! There ain't no running around in this league. You understand? [stammers] If something bad happens, you get one, you get minus one, but you don't take a fumble and minus 15. Get the snap! Can't do anything about it now. Listen to me. Can't do anything about it now. Great first play, we grind it out. Pick up like ten, 12 yards first play. Great job on the first play, -and then we bust on the second play. -Shit! Coming out in the regular offense this time. Regular right will come back to the heavy in a little bit. [Buddy] Why does John do something so goddamn stupid? It started with a damn bad snap. [announcer 2] Nichols is gonna attempt a 20-yarder and get points off a turnover. Here's the kick and it is high, end over end... and it is through the uprights and good. EMCC trails it three to nothing. [announcer 1] It looks like John Franklin III is gonna come back out at quarterback, and I actually like that. Get back to the guy who made the mistake. [announcer 2] Yeah, go with Roberts now on this drive, and it might hurt the confidence of John Franklin III. Law will stand at the right, and they're gonna throw it to him on a screen pass, just in front of him, and it's incomplete. This team's gotta get in rhythm offensively. [Buddy] Fuck. [announcer 2] Franklin takes the snap back to pass as backside pressure floats it over the middle, has a man open but just overshoots him and it falls incomplete. Oh, dear Jesus. [Wood] Hey, Wyatt's up. Wyatt's up. [Buddy] Looked sloppy as shit. We're all right. We're gonna be okay. Wyatt's back up. We're gonna be okay. I'm not worried about what's happened before. Let's go. Let's go. Let's get going and get moving. You understand what I'm talking about? All right, Let's go. Wyatt, loosen up! [announcer 2] It looks as if Wyatt Roberts is gonna come out in quarterback this drive. Right now, EMCC needs some positive plays. [Buddy] Hey! We are way better than their ass. Come on, damn it! {\an8}[Wood] Hey, don't give them any hope. Let's play. Let's play. {\an8}[announcer 2] Roberts now back to pass, great protection, fires it deep down the middle of the field. He has Wright. Caught! [Buddy] Score! Score! [Wood] Go! {\an8}At the 25, inside the 20, ten, five. Touchdown, EMCC! [cheering] [cheering continues] Atta baby! [cheering] [Isaiah] Let's go, baby! Let's go! [Wood] Attaboy. [Isaiah] Let's go! [announcer 1] Now that's the thing that Roberts gives you, the ability to stand in the pocket, to maintain composure... -[Wyatt] Hey, baby. -Yeah! [announcer 1] ...and put one on the money. [Wood] All they did was wake up a giant. All they did was wake up a giant. [announcer 2] And with 4:21 left in the first quarter, EMCC has its first lead, and they're on the board. [announcer 1] But, hey, if you're Co-Lin, you're right back on the field now. Seven to three. [announcer 1] In the shotgun is Kruzcek... takes it, rolls to his right, squares, looks back left, fires it, and it is caught right at the five-yard line towards the end zone. {\an8}-Touchdown. -[announcer 2] Yeah. {\an8}[crowd cheering] [Buddy] Hey, come here! Put your fucking head up, get your hands off your goddamn ears and be a fucking player, and not be a goddamn pussy. That's what you're doing. You're all, "Oh, woe is me. Woe is fuckin' me." You get your damn head out of your ass, and you play. [announcer 2] Right now, EMCC has gotta get a stop here and get some points on the board and some momentum. Sideline route on the right side, and, uh, it'll be just a bit short on the first down stick. [announcer 1] Wait a minute. Now they're signaling first down. [announcer 1] They are signaling first down. [shouting] Hey, whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Time-out! Time-out! Time-out! He had it! You marked wrong! You had it marked wrong! You just marked it wrong and gave 'em a first down! [indistinct arguing] You bring your... Hey, did he not set it wrong? [coach] Coach Stephens. Coach Stephens. [indistinct arguing] [referee] I hold the line of scrimmage... That's bullshit! He's right fucking there! -It's in front of you! Hey! -[indistinct shouting] [Buddy] Time-out. Time-out. I am gonna go to time-out. Hey. I'm gonna make you throw my ass out of the game... because you had a spot right in front of him. Right in front of him. Time-out! This guy right here... No, hold on a second. Hold on a second. I'm good right here, sir. Sir... I'm good. All right, all right, here we are. Here's the thing. How can a guy in the middle of the field out rule him? Move that man off that line! This is the reason why, if you let me talk. Okay? This is what's called forward progress. The line judge has to stay on the line of scrimmage. The head linesman takes all forward progresses. He had the wrong spot, okay? [Buddy] How does he have the wrong spot? [indistinct arguing] No, no, no, no. Hold on a second. There's no holding on. He had forward progress. [Buddy] Bullshit! [indistinct arguing] Okay, whoa, whoa! Hey! You said-- You said you had forward progress! No! He said... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! -He said he measured forward progress. -[whistle blowing] -[man] Let's go, let's go. -Hey! He said he had forward progress and marked it up! The ball carrier's right here in front of you. You can't see? You're the one marked it down! [announcer 2] Co-Lin will take the snap... -play action, rolls back... -[Buddy] Go get him! Go get him! ...now steps up, fires it deep down the field, has a man open on the inside and it is caught, touchdown, Co-Lin. [crowd cheering] [announcer 2] Forty-yard touchdown strike now from Kruzcek. It's now... 17-7. Man, this shit... this shit my fault. -My whole body broke. -I'll make up for it, though. [cheerleaders chanting] Let's go, Lions! [announcer 2] Trips near side, snap to Roberts, sneaks underhand to Law, Law has some room up the middle now bounces it to the outside, he's inside the 45, inside the 30. It's a footrace down the far sideline, and he is going to be pushed out of bounds around the five-yard line. [roaring] [DJ] Hey, give me my touchdown, Coach, please. [Wood] Give me four guards! Give me four guards! Four guards! Four guards! [announcer 1] Fourth down decision time, down by ten. Guys, what do you-- What do you do? [Wood] North, 62. D, swing. [announcer 2] It's fourth down and goal to go. [Buddy] Holy shit, it's fourth and one? It's fourth and one? Oh, shit. [announcer 2] Here's the snap, rolls to the right. Fires it back of the end zone and it is broken up -by Co-Lin. -Shit! Four... Hey, Marcus. Fourth and one, baby. Fourth and fucking one. It's fourth and motherfucking one! God damn it, Marcus. [player] What we got, what we got, what we got? [John] Man, he calling dumb shit. Why you gonna throw the ball on fourth and one? [player] Fuck, let's go. What the fuck, man! [John] He got... He need to call the right shit. Why you gonna throw the ball on fourth and one at the goal line? We got all these backs back here. That's dumb as fuck. [announcer 2] And that will run out the first half of play, and Co-Lin trying to upset EMCC. And EMCC has 26 minutes to make adjustments in the locker room. [Buddy] Get in gear. You are way better than their ass. That's my fault. It is fourth fucking down, and I should've kicked field goals. That's my fault. All right? I'll take that shit. You pick me up. You pick me up. I swear to God, I'll pick you up. -You understand? -[players] Yes, sir. Offense outside, defense in here. {\an8}-I've never seen them down before half. -[man] Since you've been here? {\an8}Since I've been here, in the two years I've been here. [indistinct chatter] Bag 'em up! [announcer 1] Six possessions. They've had four punts, a fumble and a touchdown. [announcer 2] Ooh. [announcer 1] Not very much the... the Lions that we're used to seeing. [Williams] Every inch you get blown off is an inch they gain! {\an8}You gotta shoot the hands to the guy that you're sighted on {\an8}and drive your feet! {\an8}Fuck throwin' your hip in the hole! {\an8}Drive your damn feet! [announcer 2] 17-7 is the score. Co-Lin on top. And now here's the snap. Gonna leave it with Lee... Fumbles the football, and there's a scramble for it at the 18-yard line. Who has it? EMCC says they do, and they do! EMCC will come up with a huge, huge fumble recovery there. -[Williams] Good job, boy! -[Ollie exclaiming] You knocked that out? You got... you knocked-- [Ollie] I did! I told ya! [Williams] Good job, boy. Good job runnin' that tab. Let's go. [Ollie] We good, man! We good, Coach. I got you. I got it. We good. I got you, Coach. You hear me? -I got you. -Good, baby. [announcer 2] And now, hopefully, the Lions could be able to push it across that goal line and get into the end zone. The snap with nine on the play clock, here's pressure from up the middle, he's floating it over the middle-- Touchdown, EMCC! And making the reception is DJ Law. [players cheering] [announcer 3] Twenty-five seconds is all it took. [chuckles] [announcer 1] I told you, guys, if they find a rhythm, hang on. It'll be a fast ride. [cheering] [DJ] Hey, Wyatt, good throw. Good throw. Way to trust that. [laughs] -Way to trust it. -Hey, buddy. I know you really didn't see me like that. -No, not really. -[laughs] I saw man-on-man, and I said, "Hey, my guy's better than that guy." [DJ] I'm going to go get it. [Wyatt] Yeah, I got faith in y'all, man. [player laughing] Oh, man. [announcer 2] 6:57 remaining here in the game, and it's 17 apiece. Not used to this. A game. [announcer 3] It's gut check time, guys. Fourth quarter. It's time to see what's in the tank. [Wyatt] Hey, let's make a damn play. [announcer 2] EMCC has rolled off 25 straight victories, looking to break the record. Twins either side on the snap, Roberts back to pass, throws it over the middle, he has a man and it's caught! He's gonna walk into the end zone. Ten, five... Touchdown, EMCC. [cheering] Big play on third down, Roberts delivering the football under pressure. [Dario] Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! [Wood] Good job. [Dario] Ahhh! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! And the Lions have broken the tie with 2:42 remaining. -Let's go! -[DJ] We still ballin'. I'm really not supposed to be talkin' crap, but that's just who I am. We on defense right now, we finna' stop. I believe we gotta stop. I trust and hope we gotta stop. We finna' stop, get in victory formation, go home eat some, uh... What... what are we eating? -Pizza. -[laughs] Some Pizza Hut. We're going home and eating Pizza Hut. We wanna eat Pizza Hut. Come on, D. [Buddy] We're gonna have to finish it now. Hey, we're gonna have to finish it now, okay? Let's go. [Wagner] I think I stopped breathing for a minute, actually. {\an8}[announcer 2] With two minutes to play in the game, EMCC up by seven. Number one EMCC over number four Co-Lin, throwing it sideline and now caught, 39-yard line. And that's gonna move the chains. Come on, guys. [announcer 2] Crowd's gettin' into it on both sides. Under a minute to play. 58 seconds, to be exact. Kruzcek... drops back deep, fires it, and it is caught at the five-yard line. Oh, my goodness. 47 seconds, clock rolling. {\an8}Hey! Hurry up! Get lined up! {\an8}You got this, Defense. Let's go! {\an8}[player] Go! Let's go! {\an8}[announcer 1] All right, everybody, strap it on. {\an8}-[whistle blows] -[crowd cheering] [announcer 2] 24-17. Co-Lin knocking on that north end zone door. No! No! [announcer 2] EMCC will go with the four-man front. Here's the snap, they give it up the middle. Lee is gonna walk it into the end zone and score from five yards out with 23 seconds on the clock. [inaudible] [announcer 2] Through the uprights, and we're tied at 24 apiece. Overtime. I don't think I've ever said those words on an EMCC football broadcast. This will be a first. So the overtime rules are to get the football at the 25-yard line, and basically you just go from there, and there's no time on the clock. [Buddy] Yeah, we want to be on defense first if we win the toss. Hey, uh... Hey! All right. Uh, here's the thing. Uh, hey, I need, uh... Who's my... who's my, uh... [Wood] Any turnover will end the ball game. [Buddy] All right, you're on defense first. We're gonna be-- They're gonna take the ball first. Okay? Any turnover, okay... will end the ball game. [announcer 2] So going on offense first, Co-Lin. EMCC, winning the toss, elects to play defense first. [indistinct shouting] Firing it over the middle, and it is incomplete. -[announcer 3] Interception. -[announcer 1] Oh, it's intercepted. Oh, but the flag came. They're gonna call interference. [Wood] Oh! You did not call that! [announcer 2] Huge for the Lions, and that is a penalty flag. It's pass interference on the defense, and that's gonna give a fresh set of downs for Co-Lin. [indistinct shouting] ...for EMCC, spotted the football on the five, play action, rolling right. Now going back to the left, it's caught by Lee, and he's going to get to the goal line and score. [crowd cheering] [Wood] Hey, Offense. Be ready. Offense... {\an8}[announcer 2] EMCC knows what they have to do. {\an8}They've got to score a touchdown to get the PAT. Damn. Ain't no way, bro. [Wyatt] Hey, we gotta score. [announcer 2] Co-Lin was the last team to beat EMCC back in 2012, first round of the playoffs, in Scooba. They're trying to knock off EMCC again, this time at home. Let's go. We gotta win this game, bro. [announcer 2] Wyatt Roberts and this offense will have one more shot to get to the end zone... Screen pass, left side, caught, and trying to cut back at the far hash... [Wood] Regular, regular, regular, regular! Regular! Get me that lineman out. [Wyatt] Thirty-three, thirty-three, thirty-three, thirty-three, thirty-three. [announcer 2] Law carries it. Starts to the right, cuts up the hashes, and now tries to bounce it back outside, going down at the 15-yard line -is Law out of the backfield. -[coach] Here we go, here we go. Here we go. [announcer 2] In the shotgun is Wyatt Roberts, trying to lead his team to victory. [players grunting] Fires it, slant, and it's intercepted... [crowd cheering] -[whistle blowing] -...by Co-Lin, and this game is over. [cheering continues] The 25-game win streak has been broken by EMCC. [cheering] [marching band playing] You get that? Yeah! CLCC! [all cheering]
