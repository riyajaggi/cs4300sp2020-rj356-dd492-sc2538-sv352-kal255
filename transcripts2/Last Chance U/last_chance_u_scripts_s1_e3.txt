 [crowd cheering] [indistinct chanting] [Buddy] Some of you young assholes did not prepare. They wanted it more than y'all did! We had chances to win this game. It should've never come down to this. That one's gone, all right? You had that here. Now that one, wad it up, throw it away, it don't matter no more. The streak's over. All that shit's over. It's over. Now, we gotta get ready for the next one.

 We gotta prepare. Our Father... [players] Who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses... Just trying to straighten little things up around here on my day off. Co-Lin's got a good team. Maybe this is a little wake-up call for 'em. In my honest opinion, I do believe our coaches and as smart as our coaching staffs are... I do believe you'll see a lot of adjustments. [Buddy] It's been, what, two years since we lost a game? {\an8}-Dang near three. -Huh? {\an8}2012. Yeah, I forgot what that feels like. It sucks. 
  subslikescript square adaptive  
 
 [chuckles] Yeah. {\an8}As a realistic person... {\an8}you know it's, it's... it's coming. You know, no streak is gonna last forever. Defensively, I didn't think we deserved to win that game. We didn't play well enough. Those things happen. Nobody cares what happens to you. What they care about is how you... how you handle it. And so, that'll be... At the end, that'll be the telltale of whether this team was one of the great ones, or, or not... in my opinion, so... Losing magnifies things twenty-fold. This season didn't end last night. This season just started. The things you're gonna learn about this team are gonna come out this week. You're gonna-- I'm gonna learn what you're made of. I told those coaches, "I don't want a single player not contributing this coming Thursday." Every one of you better get your ass ready to play. -You understand? -[players] Yes, sir. You put this team first, no matter what you do. Behind God and family, it's this team now. Because that's the only way we're gonna win. [indistinct chatter] We took an "L" right under the chin. Right in those teeth, bro. Right in those teeth. Look how many plays I played outta 88. Sixty-four. Out of 88 plays, I played 64. Bro, I'm a defensive tackle, bro. You know how tough that was? [chuckles softly] I played 88 plays. -You played the whole 88? -I played the whole 88. I didn't come off not one time. And I did special teams. [both laughing] God. God. They wasn't even that good. We got flexed. We got flexed too, though. I'll tell you what, though. From now on, I'm playin' angry, bro. I'm about to really start snappin', bro. Like, this junk got me hot. I'm about to really start snappin' in games, bro. What? Ah! But listen-- -No, for real, bro. -Man, I ain't lost in forever, bro. Practice too, bro. I'm about to start snappin'. Yeah, practice too. I said that in practice. [Wyatt] Yeah, I mean, you know, that's... that's the first loss I've had since we've been here. {\an8}And I think it's the first loss since 2012 maybe. {\an8}So, uh, definitely something... Definitely a feeling you don't like. There's always things you go back and wish you'd done different but once it's done, it's done. So, uh, I guess last time they lost a game, they rattled off 25 in a row, so, maybe... maybe that's a sign of what we can do this time, you know. So, gotta just look positive and work to get better. [Trickett] You're gonna have all the throws you think you're gonna have, {\an8}um, if you go through our regular progression. {\an8}This is just 94, right here. {\an8}I don't know, it's exactly what it is. You have your Out. {\an8}-Okay. -And you have your Dig. {\an8}[John] That game, I was real hype. {\an8}The second play of the game, I... I, uh, it was a low snap, and I tried to make a positive play out of it, it ended up costin' us. And I fumbled the ball. And I knew it was just 'cause my adrenaline was going. And then it was, you know... Coaches decided to go with Wyatt, so we just had to, you know... do what I had to do, you know, support him and... kept moving. [Wood] We did miss some reads, there's no question about it. We missed some balls we shouldn't have missed. I mean, it was a, it was a group effort. We're gonna be fine. We're going to be fine. We just gotta go to work. I think Wyatt's right on what he said. He should have probably went the other way. No question, but... [Buddy] But we don't have time for a quarterback to grow up. You know, we just don't. [Wood] He played well. I mean he threw for 337, he ran the ball and kept out of sacks, he avoided a lot of pressure. I mean, he did a good job. [Buddy] It's easier... it's easy for us to look at it on film and go, -"Hey, he should've thrown it here." -[Wood] Sure. But-- I ain't the one who got the big guys trying to hit me. [Wood] No, no doubt. [Buddy] All right. That's it. See y'all out there on the field. [player grunts] [coach] Hey, hey, hey, all right there, corner! -The fuck are you doing? -[blows whistle] [Wood] Hey, Rea. Don't stop on an in-cut route. [Buddy] Hey! Hey, let me ask you somethin'. Let me ask you somethin'. Hey, hey, hold on a second. Hold on a damn second. Y'all bring y'all's ass over here. Do you think for one fucking minute that the damn guard from Northeast is gonna come around here and stop and do this shit? Do you think he is? The one thing that this group right here, this side and this side, if we run the ball and protect the passer, stop the run and rush the passer, we can beat anybody we play. But God damn it, we won't do it. 'Cause you'll half-ass it. You will half-ass it. Don't half-ass it! Get your ass in line, get down and run! Don't half-ass it! Run it again. Run it again. Hey! I can't coach both sides of the goddamn ball. Get down and run it again! Do it perfect! You got to! We ain't that goddamn talented! [Marcel] How can we get better? -As a team? -As a unit. As a D-line. [Ollie sniffs] I mean, when it's just us, I'm like, "Fuck everybody else, bro." Fuck them. You know what I'm saying? We gotta focus on us. We won't care what the DB's doing, linebackers do. We gotta go hard though. [Penick] All right. So, when you are writing an essay-- [Ollie] Are we asking... We just telling... like, telling facts in the paragraph? -You're proving. -Yeah. You're proving whatever you say is going on in the paper. So, if you're saying that there is, um... man versus nature conflict in The Most Dangerous Game, {\an8}you gotta prove to me that there are at least three examples of that from the story. [Wagner] DJ Law, DeMario Lanier, Desmond Goss, and Demetrius Gleaton still have not turned their paper in for English. If they don't have it turned in by 3:00, it's a zero. And I've call-- I called all of them this morning at, like, 7:45, because it was supposed to be due at 9:30, and I sent all of them a text at 7:45, reminding them to turn it in by 9:30. None of them did. I have sent them all texts and called all of them now and no one will answer their phone. 'Cause-- Okay. All right, thanks. Bye. The main thing for me after kind of... the shock of us just losing, like, yes, I have that moment where, in my brain, I'm thinking... "Okay, how... Like, how're we gonna react?" [Wagner] Y'all have had how many days? It was due Thursday, you didn't do it then. Then it was due this morning, and you didn't do it then. Nobody's answering my text, nobody's answering the phone when I call, everybody's totally avoiding it. So we're all going down to the tutor and we're about to finish this paper. Like, are they gonna care about academics anymore, you know, or are they just gonna quit everything? Because that's all they wanna do, is play for that National Championship and so, when that's off the table, I mean, are they just gonna go home and then that's it? Like, they're done. I really haven't had to face that because we've never... lost. And none of them have done anything. They have nothing. -This way? -Yes. Hey. She says something, there's not a word to be said back to her, all right? Just shut up and do what she tells you to do. Okay? You got me? -[DJ] Who, me? You're telling me? -All four of y'all. I'm talking to all of y'all. Listen to me. I've done a lot for you, okay? [Mario] You gotta deal with the coach... [chuckles] you gotta deal with Miss Wagner. {\an8}The curfew, the 7:00 wake-up for breakfast, and... {\an8}All that just... on your mind, then you gotta practice. But, as in a classroom, you gotta get it... to leave here and go to another level. [DJ] Hey, what's three things y'all want to do before y'all die? [Mario] Get money. -[player] Get out of Mississippi. -[chuckles] Get out of Scooba Tech. I need some ideas. You know, school, school really isn't my thing but it's... it's something you gotta do to get where, like, where I wanna be. But on the football field, it's easy. It's... I don't know, it's just natural. It comes to me. [typing] Very good. It's very good. See? -[chuckles] -Like, I don't understand, DJ. You can do this. Like, this is good. -Why do you stress yourself out? -I don't know. I don't either, like I... If you couldn't do it and you got in here and, like, you literally couldn't put a sentence together then I would halfway be like, "Okay, he didn't do it because he can't." You know, like, I get that. -All right. -You can totally do this. This is... [whispers] This is the best one of all those guys. [chuckles] All right, Miss Wagner. [typing] [Buddy] The ultimate goal is our graduation rate. The ultimate goal is getting these guys to understand that... [stutters] it doesn't surround football. {\an8}Football is a, is a... is a tool that we use to pay for education. We lost last week. Uh, you know, I woke up the next day, I was surprised the dog was wagging its tail and wanted to lick me. -Uh, I was surprised that, uh... -[audience chuckling] I was surprised that my wife was just there. Uh, very somber. Everybody that saw me, "I'm so sorry. I am so sorry." I was like, "Nobody died, we lost a ball game. All right? And we lost a ball game 'cause we didn't prepare, we didn't prepare well." And, uh, if we can do that in practice, if we do it in the classroom, if we do it around campus, we're gonna be fine. Uh, on the football side, um, you know, [stutters] I really don't know. I really don't know much to say other than, you know, when the... the body got together one day and the body decided they needed to name a head coach, all right? And the brain spoke up and said, "Hey, I'm the... I wanna be the head coach. You know, I control everything." And then, you know, the heart spoke up, said, "No. I'm the one that controls it. I pump the blood. I make it work." You know, and then the hands spoke up, said, "No. Without me, you can't get anything done. I'm the worker, I'm the... I'm the guy working." And the feet spoke up, said, "But I take you everywhere. I take you everywhere." And... [sighs] pardon, but the little asshole spoke up. [audience chuckles] He said, "I wanna be head coach." All the other ones, they started laughing and giggling, and he got his feelings hurt and he shut down. Shut down for a couple of days. Two or three days and then, all of a sudden, the brain, he couldn't think, the heart was pumping real fast, the hands were shaking, and the feet wouldn't go nowhere. So that just proves... it goes to prove that you don't have to have a brain to be a head coach -you just have to be an asshole. -[audience laughing] Thank you for allowing me to be here. It's been a pleasure. -Thank you. -[audience applauding] -[man] Great job. -Thank you. [Buddy's wife] Hi. Yeah, put 'em over there. [interviewer] I take it there's a different Buddy at home than there is on the sideline. [smacks lips] Yes, absolutely. [chuckles] What? [Julianna] We're talking about you. It's all bad. Just go back outside. [Buddy] I'm gonna change shirts, mine smells smoky. [man] Smoky! {\an8}[Lauren] I think it's always been a part of our life, as long as I can remember. {\an8}-I could care less about it but... -[chuckles] {\an8}-We support our dad. -Yeah. {\an8}-We support our dad all the way. -Yeah, but other than that, like... [Buddy's wife] I should've made a salad or something to go with this. [Buddy] No, they got steak and chips. [stutters] They're good. I bet you-- [Julianna] A well-balanced meal. [Lauren] He's well-known around campus. Like last week, I mentioned that he was my dad and a guy at my apartment, he was like, "Whoa! That's a bad dude." I'm like, "Yeah, he's my dad." [Rebekah] We'll hear it a lot from teachers, like, "Oh, you should hang out with her 'cause she can get you into a football scholarship." Or "Don't mess with her, her dad'll kill you." -[chuckles] -Yeah. -He's a big old teddy bear. -[chuckles] -[Rebekah] Yeah. -[laughs] [Julianna] He seems scary on the outside, but then... when you call him Daddy, he's soft. [Buddy] How do you like our doll collection? At night, they come alive. [Buddy's wife] Please don't videotape that. [Buddy] At night, they come alive. [Julianna] Dad used to make us hold hands. -I was just about to say that. -After we would get into a fight, he would make us hold hands and, like, until we would, like, start laughing and... Yeah, "You look out this window and you look out here." -But still hold hands, so... -[chuckling] [Buddy's wife] Buddy, you need to take your medicine. Yeah, I know. [Lauren] He's probably one of the most generous people you're gonna meet and he's made an effort to impact young men's lives. He's our dad but he's also a dad to... 60-something football players or more. [Buddy] Shit! Come off the ball! Hey, hey! Hey! Get... No, no, no! Hell no! You get your ass in there and you go. Full damn speed! If you don't come off the damn ball, we're going to stay here and practice all damn day. We won't leave this damn drill. Let's go! Get down! Do the same thing! [Ollie] Listen. Win, lose, or draw, next year I'm entering the draft. You hear me? -Miss Wag... Miss Wagner? -I would rather you get a degree. -I'mma get a degree. -Well, not in one year. I'm talking about... I'mma go back to school when I be in the league. Okay, you promise? [stutters] I'm dead serious. -Say "I promise." -Come on now, Miss Wagner. Say "I promise." [chuckles] -You really... -Ollie. -I promise. -Thank you. [Ollie] Bro, I'm tired of school. Yo, when I start getting paid. I'm... Ooh. Listen, I just wanna live, bro. I just be living. I can die... I can die in about 20 minutes, -probably five minutes. -Stop! I'm serious. People don't be thinking like that -but I be thinking like that. -Shh! -I can die at any second. -Let's change our thoughts. -Let's think, like, positive, like... -I can die at any time. -...good... -I try to enjoy it. ...productive thoughts. -I can't, bro. -How we can be better. -Can't be better if you dead. -Better people... [Ollie] It don't work like that. [Wagner] ...better teammates, -better students. -[Ollie] See, I live... I live in the real world, I live in reality, 'cause I know I can die at, like, any minute. Miss Wagner, I thought we weren't gonna never get along. I know. Me too. I really-- I really did hate you. I ain't hate you. Well, I hated you. You hated me. It's okay. Yeah. I didn't think I hated you, but I... I just hate... It's okay that you hated me. -You don't hate me anymore. -Yeah. [both chuckle] [Buddy] Let's go! [coach] Set. [player] Hut. Set. [coach] Drive. Go. [whistle blows] [Buddy] I would be happy if we'd be violent. We are leaning way too much, offensively and defensively. [Buddy] We're a talented football team. I don't think there's anybody that has more talent in the state. We just have to play faster, and... and meaner, and tougher, and you don't want... you don't want it to slip away with a loss. [player] Ready, set! [whistle blows] [Wood] Here we go, here we go, here we go. [Buddy] Right now, the chances of us playing for a National Championship, not real good. You know, unless there is... unless a lot of people get beat. But there is a chance. But all we can control, and then what I try to get over to them, all we can control is what we do to get prepared, you know? Be better at what we do. Get down, get down, get down. Ready. Set, hit! Set inside, inside... Oh, no. Why you setting? Get down. Y'all playing bad today, boys. Defensive line, more violent, more violent. Offensive line, more violent! More violent. Be violent! [whistle blows] Gonna be a different me from now on, guys. Get used to it. I ain't gotta be your fuckin' friend. All I gotta do is coach you. You do it and we win games, that's fine. Square your ass up in your stance. I ain't never tell you to copy no damn stance. Fuck, you do what you supposed to do! Stop fucking walking! The time for "my bad" is over, son. I don't give a... That's no excuse! I'm tired of "I didn't get to fucking play." Or "my bad." Get out... get out, go Lester. It's my bad for putting your fucking ass on the field. -[whistle blows] -[coach] Run over his ass. You do your drill right, you ain't hit him that hard. Set, hit! Move, move, move, right there, hands up. Hands. Move. Good. Run. Drive him, drive him, drive him, good. [Bontrager] Who'd you hit? [Wood] Y'all keep going, keep going! [indistinct chatter] {\an8}How do you feel right now? I've got a headache. All right. What else? Tell me everything you feel. [Ollie groans] I just can't keep my eyes open. Does the light bother you? Yeah, man. All right, on a scale of zero to six, rate your headache. [Buddy] All right, Coach, we ready when you are. [coach] Ready, baby. Let's go. Let's go, guys. Let's go, guys! Come on, I ain't got a headache. You don't have a headache right now? Uh-uh, I gotta go practice. I'm all right. [coach] Go, go, jog it over, get over there. All right. [Ollie] Yeah. [Bontrager] All right. [sighs] Am I good? Nope. Just sit there. Oh, my gosh. [Buddy] Hey, hey, hey. [Buddy] We're not good enough. You gotta get off your ass and damn rush the passer. Now, damn it, be violent with your hands! [Wagner] Hi. What's my name? -What's my name? -[player chuckles] -Miss Wagner. -Okay. -What happenin'? -[Wagner] Just checking. [Wagner] You okay? I heard you got hurt yesterday. [Ollie] Nah, we were doing a tackling drill, man. Goddamn Coach Turno makin' us go full speed. Now, I was tacklin' him with my facemask, like, and I hit his ass hard. And I just... After I hit him, I just fell, bro. When you woke up you didn't know what year it was. Who said that? I'm just saying. I was there in spirit, flying around. Nah, I thought I was seeing stars though for a little bit, I swear to God. So you seen me when you opened your eyes. -[Ollie chuckles] Shut up. -[all laughing] [James] When you wake up in Scooba, what are your first thoughts? -[player] Uncut. -[James] Your first thoughts when you wake up in Scooba? Why the fuck I come here? [James] I told you. [Wagner] Ollie, that's not true. [James] I wake up here I'm stretching, -just sit there and look at the wall... -[player] It's like damn... Like why the hell am I here, bro? -Like I'm finna' give up on football, man. -[Ollie] I swear I be thinking that. {\an8}And just go and be a garbage man and make, like, a band or two a week, {\an8}and eventually work my way to about 12. [Wagner] A garbage man is not making a band or two a week. A garbage man is making a band or two a month. -Maybe. -Hold up, man, I'm saying what you got-- You gotta work your way up. When you work your way up, man, you good. [Wagner] I'm not making a band or two a week. -[Ollie] You ain't? -No, Ollie. What do y'all... Y'all need to get realistic about paychecks. [player] Hey, now, I always say, hey, if I get to that point in my life where it's too bad... Man, them rings? Sold. [Ollie] Yeah, I'm gonna sell my rings. If I ever get down bad... Oh, yeah, them rings gone. [laughing] [Buddy] I'll deal with it. We'll play without him this week. And, uh... And move forward. I think the big thing is just play full speed. You know, play full speed and... Play like your hair's on fire and we'll be fine. Hey, man, how's it going there? Everything's good? [whistles] Go lay down. Go lay down. In your room. Go lay down in your room. You don't need to be out in the light and all that stuff. [stutters] In the heat. Go lay down in your room. [Buddy] When you deal with something like a head injury, you can't play with it. So, you have to err on the side of, of being safe and not... not letting that happen. Ollie... I really can't tell if Ollie's got a headache or if he's got a concussion 'cause you just don't know Ollie. [chuckles] You know? You just don't know. Sometimes Ollie wants attention and sometimes he's really... he could be really hurt. Everybody think he's faking. -[Wagner] Faking the concussion? -Mmm-hmm. {\an8}'Cause you know how Ollie is. {\an8}[mumbles] And then... {\an8}'Cause of that, now he can't... he won't be able to play Thursday. Well, I mean, but did they not take him to the doctor? No, not this time. Why is somebody mad at... They're mad at him for that? 'Cause, I mean, that's pretty dumb. I don't think they're mad at him, they just don't want him to be whining anymore and whatever. Well, then take him to the doctor, and if he has a concussion, great, if not, great. Yeah, but... They won't let him play Thursday. -And he-- -They won't let him play Thursday, but they don't think he has a concussion. They think he's faking it. Well, that doesn't make any sense. {\an8}My senior year, I played last year and then, uh, {\an8}two games near the end of the season, {\an8}I got my fifth concussion in 14 months. {\an8}I was still playing and then the trainers pulled me aside and looked at me {\an8}and they could tell I wasn't right and then went inside, did tests, {\an8}and they pulled me out of that game, {\an8}and then we did some extensive tests and they said, you know, you're not gonna be able to play again, but I never quit fuckin' anything. I've gotten more damn interviews since I've retired than... or, stopped playing, since, than when I was playing. The damn New York Times were here last week on it, you know. The story that got out was that, you know, 'cause I didn't tell any of the trainers about all my concussions, except for the ones that I got knocked out of, obviously, and you don't have to tell 'em. I got ones that I hid, um, and they're like, "What'd you do? Do you regret that? Are you having any problems with it now?" Not really, and I don't regret it at all because I might have been pulled earlier than I was, when I was retired... you know, forced to stop. So, uh, don't regret it. It's part of the game. Although, yeah, it's for... it's had... I've had some brain problems and some trouble with that, but this game's done so much more for me than anything else could have ever done. It's all I've known. It's all I've cared to known. It's all I've loved. It's all I've cared to love. Um, and I wouldn't change it for anything. [Ollie] It's just been tough. Just not to play and not to practice. That be killin' me. It's crazy. I been sleepin' all week. Can't do nothing, couldn't go to no meetings or nothing. Walk-throughs, practices, or nothing, just been in my room. Man, I wish I was out there. [Buddy] Come off the ball. Come on, come on! -Good, good! -[whistle blows] {\an8}-Is that Isaiah? -Yeah. {\an8}What's he run like? {\an8}Fast. [indistinct chatter] [Buddy] He's on every special team. What about Ronald Ollie? Coach, if you'll go up to room 111 up there, and, uh, 112, all right, if you wanna knock on the door, you can find Ollie layin' in bed. What're you talking about? -He's-- -Shut it down? [stutters] Said he hurt his-- He had a concussion without a headache. Now, I ain't figured it out yet. No, but he's got a concussion and he's, you know... and the doctor says he's got, he's got... he's like, um, he's... he's affected by light, and he has a neck injury. Well, the neck... the neck didn't start hurting him until Friday and he told me that it was how he slept on it. -Mmm. -[chuckles] So, I mean... -Is this team doctor or family doctor? -Oh, team doctor. Well, it's a... it's a neurologist. And when he went to see the neurologist, he said... he said he had... he had a sensitivity to light when he shined the light in his eyes. Hell, I got a sensitivity to light when you shine a light in my eyes. So, well, when he comes outside, he says... he says he's... he says he's, uh... When he goes outside, he's, uh... Hey! Let's go, Tyree! He said when he goes outside, he'd been in his room, he goes outside... the light makes him... hurts his eyes. Hell yeah, when you been layin' up in a cold room, -sleeping all day. You go outside... -[laughs] [Wagner] Ollie. What're... what're you doing? What're you doing? What the hell? He just hung up on me. [Wagner] He just said, "I'm finna' go home, man. Thank you for everything you've done for me. But it just ain't meant to be." He sent that at 2:15. Since I've texted him after that, he hasn't responded. Think everybody's just on edge. I mean, we lost. [line ringing] [automated voice] I'm sorry, but the person you called has a voicemail box -that has not been set up yet. -[sighs] Damn it. Answer the phone. -[line beeps] -Oh, my gosh. I'm really gonna freaking drive over to your dorm. -I don't understand. -[cell phone chimes] Oh, hold on, hold on. "Man, Coach Stephens talking crazy to me and shit-talkin' about... I just want attention. Man, I did every fucking thing possible to satisfy y'all. Every..." Whoa! "Every motherfucking thing y'all asked me to do, I've done. [stutters] I did it. I'm trying to help the team win. Talking about me, I'm being a baby. I ain't never been a fucking baby." The minute that Ollie feels threatened or called out, I mean, his reaction is to just either flee or he's gonna go right back at you. He doesn't stop himself. Pretty sure he's on this side. But I'm not gonna stop on this side because everyone will see that. So we're gonna pull around... When you get a kid like that, having gone through everything he's been through, I mean, you know, if Coach yells at him and tells him to leave, like, that's kind of abandonment in his eyes. So then, it's like he's got to do something to see... Is everybody that he, that he cares about abandoning him or, like, where does everybody else stand? [clicks tongue] "Will you come out here and just... talk to me for a second? Coach is just... [clicks tongue] stressed and having a moment. It's all going to be fine. I love you." [cell phone chimes] "All right." [chuckles] One word. Bleh! But at least he's responding and not ignoring and... it'll be fine. [Buddy] You... you have to provide them with everything that you can provide 'em with. That's home-lovin', um, structure, um, tough love, and hope that they take it and run with it. And there's some guys that will take it and run with it and just eat it up because they've never had it before. -And there's some guys that will go... -[cell phone chimes] ...you know, try to get away from it as much as possible. So, you know... "I've got issues... [mumbles] Ollie saw a doctor, he has a concussion, he is out for this week." Hmm. Okay. Ollie's out this week. [music playing on car stereo] [Ollie] Hey, you gonna be at Aunt's house? I'm headed home now. Well, come to Shubuta then, and I'll just meet you in Shubuta. [music continues playing] -Hey, Noodle. -[man] Hi. Hey, I'm probably finna' chill over at your house till my sister get here. [Ollie] What up, fool? [man] What up, cuz? [Ollie] It's my first time home in about two months. -Straight? -Yeah, man. [snaps fingers] -I ain't seen you in a minute. -I ain't seen you either, dude. -You getting... -[chuckles] You fat, boy. Them-- They feeding you good over there, though. [Tee] Michelle went to the army. [Ollie] Who signed up? Everybody in the secondary went to the army. They said, "forget that." [Ollie chuckles] Man, we got to turn down scholarships just to go make money. -[Ollie chuckles] -That was crazy. Man, keep that stuff up, bro. Where you going next? [Ollie] I don't know. I graduate in December though. -[Tee] Yeah. -Yeah. [Tee] Go somewhere big. For real, go somewhere big. You got the opportunity to go somewhere big. For real. -[indistinct chatter] -[car horn honking] [Ollie] Hey! [blows raspberry] -What up? -[Takesha] Say hey. [both chuckle] [babbling] -[both chuckle] -Finna' go bye-bye? -You finna' go? -Yeah! [Takesha] All right be easy, then. Don't be out all night, my God. [indistinct chatter] I'm not playing, big boy. [rap music playing on car stereo] [Ollie singing] [Ollie] Let's go. [Ollie rapping] [music stops] [stadium announcer] Now entering the field, {\an8}the Wayne County High School marching band. {\an8}[crowd cheering] -What up, dude? -Hey, my man! 'Bout time you came slummin', right? I saw them put that picture of you up when you got hurt. You were so ugly! [laughs] [Jamal] It's inspiring to people he's from Wayne County, from where we from. {\an8}It's about... you don't see too many people make it like he does. {\an8}He could have been doing stuff other people doing, but he ain't. He out here inspiring people. He going to go far. I know he is. He going to go far. [Stalexus] I know that he was a good football player at Wayne County High School. {\an8}You know, he was one of the best defensive player that we had. {\an8}He made a lot of stops. He did real good. {\an8}And that caused him to get a scholarship for East Mississippi. [indistinct chatter] [Stalexus] I think he really gonna make it. You know how some people, you think, just go to college and stop. But I think he really gonna do something good with himself. Yeah, he really gonna put little Wayne County, Mississippi on the map. -He really gonna put us on the map. -Yep. [Devontae] He really gonna make something happen for this little school. [Stalexus] Yep. [announcer] EMCC haven't lost back to back, you know, in a long, long time. So they're trying not to do so tonight. And it is 14 to nothing, EMCC. First down, first down. First down, first down. Good. [announcer] It's gonna bring up another first and goal for EMCC with Twins to the right. They bring a man in motion, that's Isaiah Jones, fake it to him, it's Law, who's actually in the Wildcat, and there may be a fumbled football inside the five. Northeast comes out of there with the football. So Northeast will have it. Turn over EMCC inside the five. Law, in a Wildcat, fumbles it around the three. [Buddy] Get off the field! Hurry up! Get off the field! Come here, goddamn it! Fumble that motherfucker one more goddamn time. That's fucking ridiculous, DJ. [player] DJ! Come on! [announcer] Northeast, knocking on that north end zone door. [Mario] Let's go defense! [coach] Let's go! Come on. Get down the line, get down the line. [announcer] Here's the snap, stepping up. Actually, it's going to be Doss trying to go round the right side. And he's gonna get to the five. Dive for the pylon. Does he score? -Touchdown, Northeast! -[crowd cheering] [Buddy] Fucking ridiculous, y'all. Come on! {\an8}Come on! They ain't that fuckin' good. {\an8}How can they run quarterback... [player] He stepped up in the pocket. [marching band playing] -I came tight off the edge. -Who blocked you? -[indistinct chatter] -On Wet? [player 1] They didn't call Wet. [players] Yes, they did! [player 2] They called Wet, bro. They called it. [announcer] And two back for... Roberts, with inside pressure, now rolls to the near side and fires it near sideline. And it was incomplete near sideline around the 30. So, that's going to bring up a 4th and 8 from the 32 of Northeast. [stadium announcer] Fourth and 8 for the Lions. [Buddy] Goin' for it. We're goin' for it. [player] Let's go, O! [announcer 1] Roberts is back to pass, has great protection. Fires it over the middle. And it's, uh... it's off his fingertips. And it's gonna be Northeast's football after the turnover on downs. [Buddy] What in the fuck! Come here! Why didn't you block the goddamn three technique on 23? -It was 4-2, Coach. -It was 23! You still gotta face the guy in front of you. [player groaning] Fuck! Shut up doing that shit! I'm so sick of that! Get on the goddamn sideline! You gotta know where the hell the damn play is! You gotta know where it is! Coach, you ain't gotta push me like that. Okay, I'll tell you what. Sit your ass down. You're done. Okay, give me the... Hey! Go to, uh... Hey! Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? Go to center. Go to center. Go to center. Hey, when you got 23 and you don't block the damn guy right over ya? That's stupid! -God damn it, I want Gatorade. -[man] Oh. I thought you said water. No, that ain't what I said. [Buddy] Ooh-wee. I ain't pleased. [stuttering] I mean, we're not playin' very well. You know, we're not playin' with our mind in the game. It's one quarter of execution and one quarter of non-execution. So, we're not as good as what we think we are. So, uh, we gotta do a little better job on coachin', we gotta do a little better job on execution, and we gotta go out and play with attitude in the second half. -All right, Coach, thanks. -Sure. Sit down. Hey! Sit down and shut up. Get your damn headphones off or I'll rip them motherfuckers off. Get 'em off. Get 'em off. Look at me like that your ass'll damn walk home. Dropping fuckin' balls. Griping and complaining about not damn startin'. Catch a damn ball. Make a damn play. [player] All right, man. Shut the fuck up! Don't say a goddamn word to me! That's what I fuckin' think. Too many damn people think they got this shit made 'cause they played on last year's team. Fuck that! You gotta go out, and you can smirk all you want to, but you gotta go out and goddamn earn respect. And you ain't earned mine yet! You gotta earn mine before you get back on the damn field. You think you better than you damn are and you ain't! We may be a team that just competes with an 0-3 team, but that ain't what your ass came here for. Some of you were brought here because we thought you were players. I think I may be wrong. I fucked up recruiting 'cause I let your asses come in here. Some of ya. I fucked up on recruiting. Now, you either decide to play or your ass won't be around here anymore. Be the damn leader. Set your damn feet and throw it! It's all a fuckin' excuse! I'm tired of seeing us under-fuckin'-achieve. As a coaching staff and as a damn team. Now, by God, get after their ass in the second half. We're gonna get the fuckin' ball and we're gonna shove it up their damn nose. Now get your asses ready to play. [Wyatt] Let's go, man. Let's go. It's good. Let's do it. Y'all look like it's the first time y'all ever been cussed out before. [CJ] Coach said "dominate," brother, and we not doin' that shit, bro. Our wideouts are way better than these wideouts, bro. [stuttering] Everyday in practice we're doing... Come on, man. Let's go, bro. -[player] Y'all right there, make a play. -Let's dominate, bro. "Dominate" on three, bro. -One, two, three... -[all] Dominate! You gotta expect that shit, man. I'm telling you, man. You good, baby. Just play. I'm not worried about the score, I'm not worried about anything else, other than the next drive. The next play. That's it! [players grunting] [announcer 1] Trips nearside. EMCC wanting to go fast. Here's the snap to Roberts. Roberts gonna leave it on the ground with Law. Law coming around nearside. He's gonna be hit... uh, by a couple of guys who he pinballs off of. He stays down the nearside line, he may score. He's inside the 30, 20, 15, ten, five, touchdown! DJ Law! Unbelievable! Law got absolutely smoked. [Trickett] Good fucking run, baby! That's what I'm fuckin' talking about. Good shit, DJ! Good fuckin' run! [announcer 1] Good, now that's 54-yards on the touchdown run for DJ Law and EMCC is up 20 to 7, pending the PAT. What a run, Glenn. -[announcer 2] What a run. -I bounced off that shit. -[indistinct chatter] -[laughing] [Buddy] Let's go. [player] There you go. There you go. [indistinct chatter] [announcer 1] In the shotgun, awaits the snap. Here it is. He's back to pass, has time. Fires it nearside and it's intercepted at the 29! Going down the nearside line, 15, ten, five, touchdown, EMCC! CJ Reavis will make the pick-six from the 29 and score. CJ Reavis, once he caught that one at the 29, that was a safe touchdown call. [crowd cheering] [whistle blows] [player] Let's go, bro. Let's go! 1-0 again, baby. Let's go! [announcer 1] A fade pattern, nearside. He has Lanier... [announcer 2] What a catch! [announcer 1] He caught it! Touchdown! Oh, my goodness! Are you kidding me! [announcer 2] Guys, that was a phenomenal catch by Lanier. [announcer 1] He caught that ball? [announcer 2] He did. Down at his knees, falling back... Your ass is a good football team, you understand? -[players] Yes, sir! -Don't make me go into the halftime and do that bullshit no more. You play from the damn word "go." Great job, guys! Great job! That's a heck of a good job to come back and play the way you can play! Hey! You ain't gotta be back till Sunday at curfew. [all cheering] [TV playing] [babbling] Dreads... Re-twist... [man on TV] When we come back, the story of the Georgia running back who is so good, he has a town named after him. -[baby humming] -[Ollie] All right. [groans] -Mama! -[Takesha] Mmm? She put... She puttin' her shoes on. We finna' go. [indistinct chatter] [Rachel] When he started playing, at the time, when he was pee-wee, the coaches always tell him, "If you get a sack, we'll take you out to eat pizza." Oh, my God. [laughs] He get four or five of 'em. He wouldn't stop. And then they'd tell him again. Next day, someone would holler, "I'll give you $10, I'll give you some money if you do this, do that, at the game." So, he was determined to do that. [Vera] When I first saw him play football in high school... You know, I don't know nothin' about football, but I couldn't sit down. He won't let me sit down. If I sat down, I was scared I was gonna miss somethin'. When they holler his name, I said, "Oh, my God." It's good to have a child going this way. [Takesha] He was small, he was only five. He was five when it happened. So, he really probably can't tell you nothing about it, but... Actually, we was here. At the time, my mama was renting this same trailer right now that our cousin is renting. [Rachel] Been home about 10:00 that night somebody was knocking on my door. I thought it was my son coming back home. But it wasn't him. It was him. Ronald's father, looking for her. He always down here botherin' her, pickin' at her. She just called the police. Kept callin' the police. Kept calling... When he would come down here and get into it with her, I always could hear it. You know, 'cause I was just right there. But this particular night, it just wasn't meant for me to hear. [Takesha] I could hear the argument. They was arguing. Like, my room was the... first window over here and his was the second. You know, I'm just listening to the argument then the next thing I hear, gunshot. When I hear the gunshots, I jump up, I ran out, I see him running. Running straight through this path. And went around here. And the police was chasing him. And they said... police said by the time they make it to him, they heard a gunshot. He had shot himself under... Shot and killed himself. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. [Takesha] Yeah, he'll call me, he'll talk about it. Because it was his mom and his dad. It wasn't our dad. So, you know, for him to lose his mom and his dad, you know what I'm sayin'? I can only imagine 'cause, like I said, he was only five. Like, we were leaving the hospital when our mama got killed, he was like, "We leavin' mama?" He thought that she was gonna be all right and come home. He didn't get the understanding there, like, she's gone forever. He just thought she was gone to the back. I guess 'cause he was so young but he thought that she was supposed to come with us but that was a night that took a toll on all of us. But like, in the beginning, like, I could look at him, and I could see his dad. He looks like his dad too. And I used to just be like, "Boy, I can't stand your daddy," and people used to tell me, like, "Don't say that to him." You know what I'm sayin'? They felt like, if it weren't for Ronald's dad, they mom would be living. And I had to sit down and go through that with them. I said Ronald didn't ask for that. He's still your brother. You know, he got a lot bottled up inside of him too. He feel like people don't love him, nobody loves him. You know, he'll say that sometime. "Why nobody don't love me?" I said, "People..." I said, "I love you." I said, "We do love you." You know, they'd be in this feelings, then. Mmm-hmm. We couldn't do nothing. And I know they couldn't do nothing. But... we're gonna make it. But, y'all keep praying for us. And he'll go further. Let him go furthest he can go, Lord. Whatever on his mind that he wanna do with that football, let him take it further. And God be on his side with us with him. He gonna make it. He gonna make it. Ooh, hell yeah. [Ollie] Live for the moment. Never know when you're gonna die, so, live for the moment. I really don't love football... it's just something I can do. I'm just worried about the paychecks really. I plan on trying to make it to the league. I hope so. If that doesn't work out... uh... I don't have too many plan B's, so... the first plan gotta happen. It gotta happen.
