 [Bontrager] Ready? Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron. {\an8}Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron. {\an8}Okay. Gonna test it again. Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron. Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron. -Okay. Good. What month is it? -September. -Okay. What year is it? -'16. -What day of the week? -Uh, Monday. I'm gonna read you a string of numbers. I want you to repeat them to me backwards. Six, one, eight, four, three. Three, four, six...

 eight, one? No. One, eight. [Bontrager] Diagnosing a concussion is the hardest part. The brain could still be bruised, but that wouldn't show up on a CT scan. Like, Isaiah's CT scan was normal. All right. We're gonna try a non-contact practice today, and we're gonna see how you do. I would much rather have, you know, a sprained ankle or a torn ligament on the knee because you have diagnostic tests that can confirm that. You have your MRIs and X-rays. It's hard to diagnose a concussion, because you have to go by what the athlete is saying, um... because you can't always see their symptoms. [Trickett] First days feel foggy, don't you?

 {\an8}And when you're in a... uh, concussed state, it's like you're... {\an8}You're not drunk, but you're damn near close to it, you know. That's actually what doctors describe it as. A state of drunkenness, you know. It happens. -Good? -[chuckles] [marching band playing] [Wagner] Would you go to football practice without a helmet and pads? -And, like, let somebody hit you? -[player] No. {\an8}No, you would not. {\an8}Do not walk into class in the morning, or any day, with nothing. You have got to have a pencil. You have got to have paper. Play the game. When teachers are putting those grades in the computer, they're human beings. And when we see your name, we see your face. It's easy to flunk an asshole. You go in and you act like a jerk every day... and you sleep and you pull your phone out and you act like you don't care... the teacher ain't gonna care when they're putting that grade in. Half the battle is somebody just liking ya. Man, what'd I tell you? Get all your foot in the ground. {\an8}-[coach] Set, hit! -[grunting] {\an8}-[coach] Stack! Stack! -[whistle blows] {\an8}[Williams] Hustle back, hustle back! {\an8}Damn it, son, do you understand what we just told you to do? {\an8}-[Kam] I was trying. -Well, don't try! Do it, son! Do it! [coach] Don't try, do it! [Williams] That's some bullshit, man. You can't get lined up. -Hey, get ready to practice, Kam. -[panting] Yes, sir. Snap out of that shit. Whatever going on, snap out of it. [Williams] There you go. Run, run, run! -[whistle blows] -[Williams] Hey, hey. You had him. Swim across that thing. You got a Black? I don't smoke. What you going around asking for a Black for and you can't finish a drill? -The fuck you mean? -Huh? When the fuck couldn't I finish a drill? {\an8}-Like, never. -When? {\an8}-Say one time. -What? -Say one time, man. -Like, yesterday. -The snake. -[clicks tongue] Nigga, I did that shit. On your time. 'Cause that's what they say. Run it on your pace. Did they not say run at your own pace? -No! -Maleke! -Did they not say run at your own pace? -Dude! No! Well, you ain't been here long enough. -I ain't be here long enough? -You ain't been here long enough. -And I been here longer than your ass. -Hey, fool. Trying to get a motherfuckin' Black, nigga. You can't find a dollar? Go ask Coach. Go tell Coach, "I need a dollar for a Black & Mild." [Kam] Coach know I smoke that shit. I don't smoke weed, though. So that's good. [Wagner] You were doing your midterm critical analysis today, were you not? -[Kam] I know. I finished it. I-- -You didn't. -I will. -She e-mailed me and said you did not. You just walked out in the middle of class. That you said you didn't wanna write your paper. You said you were done. If she hadn't have contacted me, you would have gotten a zero. And the fact that she contacted you, that means she care. Sit up, man. Why... I don't understand the thought process. Like, you're sitting in there, you've done everything you were supposed to do. [clicks tongue] My phone broke. [Wagner stammers] Okay. Okay. And-- That's what blows me, it made me mad. I couldn't even focus to write the paper. I sat there for a good ten minutes after I broke my phone. And I just... I couldn't think of anything, 'cause... I'm just sitting there thinking about my phone. [Wagner] Okay. Is the phone a big deal? Yeah, it's a big deal. I get it. Y'all are attached to your phone. Your whole livelihood is on your phone. I get it. But that phone working today doesn't have a damn thing to do with the rest of your life. You making this teacher mad... will impact the rest of your life. Like, you were in a great mood, you were doing your work... Why when we do good do we have to sabotage? [Kam] I don't know. [Williams] You need to be finding an answer. 'Cause if you don't, then you gonna ruin the rest of your life, son. [Kam] So, I'm only happy, you know. I mean... I don't handle bad stuff too well. [Wagner] But let's look at it as when the bad stuff happens... you can make it worse, -or you can make it better. -Mm-hmm. [Wagner] 'Cause some of the bad, you create. Okay. She says you can come by after lunch. -[sighs deeply] -So, can you go at 1:00? -Yeah. -[Wagner] Why the deep breath? [Kam] 'Cause I was about to go to Meridian to get my phone... to get it turned on. Your phone can wait, man. -[Wagner] We good? -[Kam] Mm-hmm. [Williams] Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. [Wagner] Okay. Let's go. -Hmm? -We're good. All right. -One o'clock. -[Kam] I know. [Wagner] So negative! -[Williams] Who? -You! How was I negative? Just getting on to him. Just... calm your ass down. -[Williams] Whatever. -[Wagner chuckles] [groans] He needs to understand reality, too. Life ain't always gonna be about second chances. You need to get it right the first time. This hasn't happened in a while. I mean, he's gotten better. Every week, mentally, attitude-wise, he's come out to practice happy. He's played well. [Crowder] It's thrown over the middle, intercepted by EMCC! And it's a big boy. [Winfield] Kam Carter again, he has been dominant in the middle. [Williams] He had a great game. He had a SEC-caliber defensive lineman game. But he has his I-don't-care attitude sometimes. I've learned that I can't chew him out. But I had to be stern in talking to him about why he's doing what he's doing. Let's not revert back to the things that, you know, we left behind. [Kam] I wasn't the ideal player, I guess you could say. I got into a lot of trouble, my freshman year. I failed two drug tests. And then, you know, I mean, I pretty much knew then... that that was the end of the road right there. I have, like, ADHD, so... I take a lot of medication, so I mean... My philosophy behind using it was if all these medications that they... that the doctors prescribe me, making me sluggish, making me not wanna do what I wanna do, making me, you know... not be what I need to be at my craft... why take it when there's an alternative where I can just smoke this J, you know? And then I wanna go to practice, I wanna be active, you know. I don't have to take all these fucking pills. I mean, I felt like it was a no-brainer to me, but, I mean, it's illegal, so, you know, you can't do that. [Latoya Carter] I raised him until he was seven, and I was still a teenager, you know. And the school would always call and say he was into this and he was, you know, misbehaving. {\an8}It was hard to keep him focused and sitting at his desk. {\an8}He wanted to be here and he wanted to be there and playing this and... {\an8}You know, his attention span was really short. And I didn't know, because I was so young. I'd never even heard of ADHD at that point. [Aaron Carter] It started early. I knew he was gonna be a big kid. {\an8}Uh, he wanted to throw the football, you know. {\an8}Running around the backyard, push him down, jump right up. He wanted to be the tough kid. Which, you know, as a coach, I know that's what you need. I started training him his eighth-grade year, so he was already lifting weights at the strength of a high school player. And by his tenth-grade year, the floodgates opened. I received over 111 handwritten letters from different people in one week. Penn State had all the resources to make any dream come true. But, you know, things didn't go as well as we hoped. Obviously, that's why we're here, where we are today. [Williams] It's about what it's gonna take to get the job done and come home with a victory. And that's handling our responsibility up front. Man, it seemed like... when that damn vent came on, boy, I'm smelling corn chips, man. Y'all got-- -[player 1] Kam. -[player 2] Boy! That thing there... [laughing] That thing right there is funky. [Williams] Cuz, put your damn shoes back on, man. [players laughing] You need to put some baking soda on your socks. At least keep your feet in your shoes. Don't throw that at nobody. That's selfish, man. [all laughing] [Williams] No selfish plays. No second-guessing. Let's go out there and execute, and we'll be fine. We'll be fine. [Milner] This week is Itawamba. {\an8}If you consider rivalry games, this right here is your rivalry game. {\an8}In 2012, they ended our potential national championship run {\an8}by beating us on a field goal at the end of the game. This time, they're ranked. I think they've got more talent than they have had in years. It should make for a huge match-up. [indistinct chatter] [Ed Holly] It is their Super Bowl, understand this. {\an8}They're gonna come out. They're gonna give you their best shot. {\an8}We not only have to take it, we gotta give it back. Our offense is on fire. We got the best offense in the country. Can we hold up as a defense? And I say yes. Here we go. Grab a line. [Pellegrin] We moved up to number 11. {\an8}The rankings are not foolproof. {\an8}You have human voters prone to make mistakes. {\an8}They're prone to rank someone's victories higher than the other, they're prone to... Sometimes, they're prone to spite. And that's why it's so important to... like Coach Stephens has said, just leave no doubts. We lost to Jones, but we still control our own destiny. If we win the state with one loss... I don't think there is any way they can keep us out of the national championship. [Wood] Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. [Buddy] Jeez. Jeez. Jeez. [Wood] Can't get out of here the day before and bust on a play we're counting on being able to run. -Can't do it. Can't do it. -[Buddy] Jeez. Jeez. Come on, guys. Pick it up. Let's go. [Crowder] De'Andre Johnson, so far this season... {\an8}hasn't run the offense as cleanly as you would expect. Is it too high of expectations on him? [Crowder over radio] Johnson fires down left sideline. Intercepted at the 19-yard line-- Is he good enough? Is he as talented as we thought he was, or is he just rusty? [Buddy] I didn't see De'Andre taking charge. I didn't see him stepping into his passes. You know, just being that leader of making sure everybody's on the same page. Um, and he... You know, he'll get better at that. Again, you know, it's been two years since he's taken snaps. You know, the guy taking the snaps for us, he's the guy that runs the show. [De'Andre grunts] [Trickett] It was your second game, so that is gonna happen, but we wanna keep cutting down on the miscommunication stuff. Shit like that happens. Good players gonna make good plays. [De'Andre] I was nervous. That was kind of a bad start for me. Throw an interception. I'm like... [sighs] "This the comeback, huh? I can't come back like this. I gotta come back stronger." [Buddy] You gotta look outside. Look outside. Make the man call. -Make the man call. No! -Fuck! Outside! Look outside! There's 27! Make the man call! All right. No. No, no. Gosh almighty, Tim. I gotta get another job. I gotta do something else. With young people today, in today's society, I think you have to be... You have to be ultra-direct, because they don't get it in a lot of places. They don't get direct talk. -Run! No, come back. -[whistle blows] Get north and south! North and south! Don't do this. Do it! If you constantly praise 'em, they relax a little bit, and I don't want 'em to relax. I want 'em to keep constantly striving to be better, and I don't want 'em to be complacent. I don't want 'em to get complacent in any part of their life. All right? There ain't no get-up! This ain't high school! Ain't no get-up! Get down and let's go, run! -[whistle blows] -Get out. Get out. Get out. Go over yonder and sit in the dadgum shade the rest of the day. Sit in the shade the rest of the day. I ain't putting up with it. Go! Walter, you're starting at left guard this week. Get your rear end over yonder. Horsecrap! Did you go to treatment this morning at 6:45? No! You didn't! I'm sick of it! Quit if you want to! Gleaton, whining and crying about his knee [stutters] and he didn't go to... Didn't even go to treatment today. Hurry up! Hey, y'all handle that stuff and keep him from getting one of my quarterbacks killed. Now, I don't trust he ain't gonna get a quarterback hurt. Missed treatment this morning, and then come out doing this stuff. I promise you, four of y'all together, ain't gonna get the... Ain't gonna get your butt whooped. {\an8}[exhales] [Zeke] I don't like this boot, bro. You know they ain't gonna let me play. [Kam] I was telling them, son, "I'm not gonna sit out in D-I if I sprain my fucking ankle." [Zeke] I ain't never been D-I, so shit. I don't know what go on. [Kam] Ask my nigga Chauncey. Hey, son, you sprain your ankle in D-I, what'd they do? Tell you to get right back on the fucking field, son. If you sit out, you gonna be out for a while. And you gonna lose your spot. "Can't make the club in the tub," that's what they tell you. -[Zeke] Can't what? -"Can't make the club in the tub." [whistle blows] -[De'Andre] You playing this week? -[Isaiah] I'm hoping. I feel good. On the real, I feel good. Mm-hmm. It's gonna be a great week. [Isaiah] That man told me, "We really gonna need you Thursday." -Yeah? -I told him, "I got you, look, 'cause I've been really pissed the fuck out." Right. I only did three fucking plays. For me to feel good about myself, I have to be out on the field. I've never sat on the bench. Like, once you take sports from us... we don't know anything else. Like, I can tell you, high school, football season was over with, I stopped going to school. I mean, I just... I... That's the only way I got through school, was football. I really need to do that, uh, what's that, uh, one math I need to do? -[Jazlyn] What math? -Finite math? I gotta do that. [Jazlyn] You said we were gonna do that in January. [Isaiah] I know. I'm gonna take the class in January. We'll take the class together. [stuttering] Bae... -No. -No? -Why you say... -You're gonna do the work. -Huh? -And you're gonna pay attention. And you're not going to go daze off into whatever zone you go into. I don't be in no zones in class, I pay attention. -I pay attention in class. -You pay attention? Duh, I pay attention in class. I'm about to go to class early. -You about to go to class? -Isaiah about to go to class early... Go ahead. Go to class, you gonna be sitting in there, -the only person in there. -Just sitting there... [Isaiah] I got me a fiancée. Keep my head right in them books. [chuckles] I need help off the field, she gonna be there with me, no matter what, off the field. So anything I do, she there with me to support me. And that's what I love about her. [Jazlyn] "You're going with me." That's what he told me. He's like, "You're going with me. Wherever I go, you're going." {\an8}He said, "When I pack up." He said, "You're gonna pack up, {\an8}and we're gonna go." {\an8}And he said, "We're gonna start our own life." You miss me? [Isaiah] I miss you. I always miss you. [Jazlyn] Are you gonna text me this class? [Isaiah] Yeah, I... Don't I always text you when I'm in class? [Jazlyn] So he's happy. He's, like, excited about it. That's all he talks about. He's getting ready. Getting ready. We have to get this done. We gotta get our grades right. Gotta make sure there won't be... That when it's the end of the semester, we can both leave with good grades... and no regrets. Make sure that he doesn't get hurt, keeps himself healthy and go to the NFL. He say he wants to play pro football. [Isaiah] At running back, I'm getting hit every play. Every time I'm doing something on that field, I either get hit, I gotta block somebody, or I gotta do... certain thing to end up on the ground. You don't feel it during the game because your adrenaline is rushing. And then, I guess, after, when you calm down and you wanna just lay asleep, it all come at once. [chuckles] 'Cause it's constant, like, it'll go away then five seconds later it'll come back in a different spot even harder. I just deal with it. I don't like taking pain stuff, I just deal with the pain. [chuckles] [Clark] Well, football is a game that is not played by choir boys. I promise you that. As a matter of fact, in America today, it's the last bastion of our society, {\an8}where young men can hurl their bodies into one another in non-lethal combat to test their manhood. It's a test of who you are. I hear this talk all the time about, you know, the rules now to protect the head injury and all that. I agree with all that. But if the football people were to take the face mask off of helmets, two things would happen. You'd cut out all the head injuries and neck injuries and that sort of stuff. And also, you'd find out how tough some of these guys really are. [laughs] [Tim] I gotta put more in my introduction. {\an8}Well, if you know that, why are you waiting on me to say that? {\an8}'Cause I thought that was good enough for it. {\an8}-But why did you just say what you said? -Because in the-- Because you knew what I was gonna say. Read that to me. [Tim] "High school and college both have differences," period. [Briggs] You said "differences," and you wrote "different." [Tim] Mmm. So I gotta put an "s" on that? -[Briggs] You gotta put "c-e-s" on there. -A "c-e-s." [typing] {\an8}[Briggs] So, okay, what's the rule with subject-verb agreement? If your subject has an "s," your verb doesn't. -[Tim mumbles] Doesn't. -Okay. So, look right here. And apply what I just said. [Tim] "A high school student often depend on their parents." [Briggs] A student. One student. [Tim] Oh, yeah, I see what you're saying. -I see. -[Briggs grunting] But I'm saying... It's your verb. No "s." "S." Not... Don't you put it on that noun. [Tim] Hold on. -[Briggs] "A student" means one. -[Tim] Mmm, one. [Briggs] No "s," so I've gotta put a "s" on the verb. [Tim] Some people think college is gonna be a walk in the park, but it ain't. To be honest, school ain't really for me. I get so confused, I get nervous and I'm like, "Oh, man. I ain't gonna be paying attention, man." If it wasn't for football, I wouldn't even be in college to be real. There's some stuff in there that we still gotta work on. -[Tim] Mm-hmm. -It's not perfect, but if we can get rid of the subject-verb agreement, that's the difference between passing and failing. [Tim] Yeah, Miss Briggs, she take out time for me. I guess 'cause, like, I respect 'em and I don't talk back to 'em. So... You show them respect, they'll show you the same. And so, you need some help, they'll help you. She would do... Take out time for me. That's one somebody I can't forget when I leave here. [Wagner] Tim, are you good? [Tim] I'm always good, Miss Brittany, you know that. [Wagner] Did you tell Miss Briggs thank you? -Appreciate it, Miss Briggs. -Any time, Tim. [Wagner] Bye, Tim. [Tim rapping indistinctly] Uh! [rapping continues] Uh! [indistinct chatter] -What's up? -What's good? I'm gonna get you back, bro. That was a sneaky little... Hey! Hey, what's up? Huh? [indistinct chatter] [laughing] [Tim] Get his ass! -Get his ass! -[player] God damn. -[grunting] -[laughing] Oh, oh, my shoulder. [all grunting] [indistinct chatter] Oh, there goes Miss Briggs. I gotta go. Miss Briggs, you ain't seen nothin'. If you would put that much energy into English... -I do. -Go. Have a seat. [Wagner] Why are you not in class? {\an8}-[Kam] I got kicked out. -[Wagner] Why? It's, uh, for cussing. I was like, "Sir, I don't feel like doing this shit." He was like, "Uh, keep talking like that, {\an8}I'm gonna file a vulgar language report on you." {\an8}-I'm like, "Sorry, what?" And-- -Kam, what is going on with you? -Nothing, I'm chilling. -Kam, what's going on? I don't feel like doing this shit. Well, okay. Well... [chuckles] Do you just get to go through life doing stuff when you feel like it? [Kam] That's how I live. And that's why you're here. Because that's how you lived. Those were the decisions that you made. You're here because of that. If I get my work done and all my... all my shit's done, you know-- Are you in your class right now getting your work done? -No. Because you got kicked out. -'Cause he was bitchin'. -He's the teacher. He's allowed to bitch. -[scoffs] See? And that's where the system fucks up. Okay. You're right. It's the system's fault. It's everyone else's fault but yours. [laughs] Uh-oh, uh-oh. I believe y'all need to take that camera there. [chuckles] He just need a haircut, he can't think right. [player 1] They've been babying Kam since he got here. A lot of players on our team get babied. -[player 1] True. -[player 2] I'd get on his ass, too. -Kam! -[Kam] What? [player 2] What your daddy do to you? [Kam] Fuck you mean, nigga? [player 2] What he do? -[Kam] Don't step in that shit. -[player 1] What you gonna do? [Wagner] We're not fighting in my office. Just leave him alone. They came and got Kam out of class, man. {\an8}[Wagner] Brian, and it's not funny and it's not good. {\an8}-Man, he crazy! It is funny! -[laughing] -[blows raspberry] -[Brian] Teacher was like, "Don't use no vulgar language in this class," or some shit. "I'm a grown-ass man! I got three kids." -I told you he just said that! -"I got three kids." -[shushes] -"Who the... Who do you think you're talking to?" Nigga geekin', he crazy. -[Wagner] It's not funny. -Ain't nobody laughin' at it. [Wagner] Yeah, everybody in here was laughing. Y'all all be laughing when your ass is still in Scooba in May. [all laughing] I just gotta apologize. I'm good. [knock on door] Hey, Mr. Jenkins. My fault. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. Hey, go out there. [Wagner] I'm sympathetic to his issues and, you know, I'm assuming he's taking his medication and, like, that all that is under control. And I'm sympathetic to that. But it also doesn't give you a free pass. -It won't happen again. -[speaks indistinctly] [Wagner] He's shooting himself in the foot. You get Player of the Week, you have a hell of a game, and he does good on the field, so he thinks he can quit at everything else? Like, that kind of stuff, I just... [sighs deeply] I mean, I... It's in those moments where I just wanna be like, "Okay, whatever. Like, just okay." [chuckles] [Williams] I tell him that's a rollable offense. -No, Davern. -It is! It's a rollable offense. That's why I don't... I'm not talking to you about this stuff. I don't need you getting on to him and all that. -It's a rollable offense. -[Wagner sighs] I need your support on that, Miss Wagner. You have my support when I turn him in for something that I... It went, I mean, even, like, right now, he's... We're working through it. [chuckles] See, if you roll him, you won't have to work through it. He'll get it done. Miss Wagner said you went and talked to that dude. -I did. -How'd it go? -It was straight. -What'd you say? I said it was my fault for being disrespectful. It won't happen again. So you're gonna come out to practice today with that same attitude? No. Uh, I've had a better day since we talked. -Okay. Well, you might have a worser day. -Why? -'Cause you gotta roll. -Why? 'Cause everybody know you cussed out a teacher. I can't do nothing about that. I can't just sit by and do nothing about that. Can you just run me? -[player] Yay, tacos! -Okay. I'll run you. -[Kam] All right. -You ain't gonna like it. -I'll run. -Why not roll? I wanna roll you. [sighs] I just hate it and it makes my stomach hurt for the rest of the day. Well, that's why I do it, 'cause you don't like it. -[stutters] If I run you-- -But if I run, then we'll kill two stones. -You feel me? -No, but I want you to pay for it. I really want you to pay for it. I've coached guys with similar disorders and similar problems, in the past and have been able to function fine. I just think Kam, within himself, have to take responsibility and acknowledge what it is, and try to do better with it. And that's the part I don't think he does. I think he uses it as a crutch. I need you to understand what you did, 'cause what you did was wrong. Nah, I understand that. I can't let you off easy. Your teammates know you acted crazy. Like I said, Coach, I don't be having too many bad days. -It's once every-- -Keep it that way. -It's once every blue, blue moon. -We're trying and keep it that way, Kam. [Wood] Let's go, let's go, let's go! Don't wait on 'em. {\an8}[Williams] Watch the damn ball! Watch the ball! -[whistle blows] -Come on, guy! Watch the damn ball! Jesus Christ. Hey, bro. How you doing? -How I'm doing? -Yeah. Not real good, man. Not real good. [Vijay] They said I have a chance to start... [inaudible] {\an8}...but he's extremely talented. Extremely talented. {\an8}It's just how things fold out. [player] Vijay, the last two days, we done got-- Scored. I scored about four times. [player] You are point dead lying, what is wrong... Yo! -What up? -[player] We can watch it on film. -Tell that lie to somebody else. -We can go get it on film. Tell that lie to somebody else. I can't do nothing about it. But I'm always ready. Always. There's not a time I'm not ready. -[Vijay] Ready, set! -[whistle blows] {\an8}[Buddy] Get off the field. Defense, you're up. Hey, hey, hey, get your ass beat this week. -[De'Andre] Let's go. -[Buddy] Because you don't execute. Go ahead. Forgetting routes, not knowing who to block. [De'Andre] Don't do that. Don't do that. I fucked up, too. Get your helmet, Thad. Camera watching you. Family watching you. Come on. Get your helmet, Thad. [Ed Holly] Off the field! Off the field! I had an awful practice, man. Nah, see... Probably... Look, look, look. Probably physically, but mentally, you were fucking sharp. You really surprised me when you was calling down tackles and guards. You did good, man. -It's practice. -[whistle blows] -Hey, Walter! Get the snap down! -[De'Andre] Look, Walter did it. Something wrong with the ball. Something wrong with the ball. One time, I threw a go-route and shit came out wrong, too. Something wrong with them balls. Leave it at that. [Ed Holly] Guys, this side runs, they're getting six frickin' yards! That's awful! How do we not dominate inside damn run? {\an8}Get your head up and play football! {\an8}-Do your job! -[Williams] We gotta get lined up! Come on, Kam! Wake up, son! Damn! He the center, you've been playing the G all damn day, right? -Oh, I thought I was over here. -Tighten down. [panting] -I don't know what's wrong with me today. -[whistle blows] [Buddy] Let's go, everybody, up! [panting] [Buddy] I want to be... I want to be, uh... I wanna be positive, okay? I want to be positive and I'm gonna be, but we're not executing offensively, and we're not executing everything that we need to as a team. Does anybody out here think that we had a great day today? If you do, let me know, okay? It wasn't a great day. You got to focus, right? And I expect the quarterbacks... Look at me, Vijay. I expect... Hey, I see a long face. I see a long face. I don't know why. I need to see the face that I saw about six weeks ago. Happy, enjoying things, okay? Some of you just going through  the motions. When you go through the motions, you gonna get your rear end beat. You gonna get your rear end beat. Watch. I... You know... I don't know. You all have that stuff inside that makes you want to be great. Some of you won't let yourself be it. And some of you ain't gonna be around here in the spring... 'cause I'm gonna get rid of you. If you don't do what you're supposed to do, act how you're supposed to act... I'm gonna get rid of you. De'Andre, lead your team. [De'Andre] Whose Father? [all] Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name... [De'Andre] Lions on three, champs on six! -One, two, three. -[all] Lions! -[De'Andre] Four, five, six. -[all] Champs! [Wood] I know, I know. I saw it. I watched the same practice. -[Buddy] They're not concentrating. -[Wood] It ain't the first time. [Buddy] Oh, I know. [Wood] I mean, we're gonna be okay, we just got to get them to the gate. Just get them in the gate. We're gonna be all right. But they were inconsistent at best. Good at times, really good. And bad at times. Just inconsistent. [Williams] Hey, all y'all getting iced up. Coach Johnson, can you make sure they get iced up while I take care of Kam? Come on, Kam. You got from here to the goal line. [Kam] Can you tell me when to straighten out? [Williams] I will. Just roll. See, why you couldn't be that polite with the teacher today? I don't get it. Hey, hey! You're getting good at this, Kam. Come on. Soon, you may be immune to it, then we got to start bear crawling. Or you just start doing right. Whichever comes first. Five more yards. Come on. Ho. Sit up. Coach, I'm so dizzy. I know it. I can't even open my eyes. [Williams] Hmm? I can't even open my eyes. [Williams] Come on, get your balance. Be respectful to everybody. Everybody's here trying to help you, you got me? Okay, if you got an issue with somebody, you come find me. Okay? If I can't solve it, we'll take it up the food chain, but don't you try to handle a situation yourself like that, all right? All right, Coach. [coughing] [coughing continues] [indistinct chatter] -[player 1] What? -[player 2] Run that bitch to the ground! [all clamoring] -Got him! -[all cheering and laughing] Yeah! Ice man! [Eszmone] I don't wanna hear your shit. [all laugh] [Wagner] Isaiah's pretty hell-bent on playing. I think the doctors did rule that he had a concussion, but they're going off of, like, what his symptoms are. The guys say that he's not telling the truth about his symptoms and saying that he's fine so that they'll play him, but that he's really not. Man, Isaiah walked out of the cafeteria. His car is that way. So he walk out the door, he walking this way. I was like, "Where you going, Isaiah?" -"I don't know, man. I don't know." -[all laugh] [Wagner] I don't really know that what he does tonight is gonna cause him to gain an offer or lose an offer. I mean, I think, athletically, he has proven himself. To me, the only thing at this point that is going to lose him offers is character issues or academics. [Isaiah] I walked to the locker room. Coach Trickett said, "Bro, where you just come from?" -I said... -[player] I don't know. "Bro, I don't even fucking know." [all laughing] And I just walked from my room. [Wagner] I mean, I understand that it's more than just a game to him. But, you know, I mean, he's a kid, and I don't know that he fully understands the scope of the situation that he's possibly putting himself in, long-term. [cheering and laughing] [inaudible] {\an8}[reverse indicator beeping] [Buddy] There's only one thing you can do, okay? There's only one thing you can do that's gonna make you and everybody else in the world happy. And that's to go out and win the game, okay? You got to find it in here to be focused, to be pissed off for 60 minutes and go play like heck, you understand? Go get after their ass, now, because I'm telling you, they're gonna... [stuttering] It ain't gonna be no easy game. But I promise you, if you go out there and you lay it on 'em... it's gonna end their year. You understand? In a bad way. -Is there an ass whoopin' in the air? -[all] Yes, sir. -Is there an ass whoopin' in the air? -[all] Yes, sir! -[De'Andre] One, two, three! -[all] Lions! {\an8}-[De'Andre] Four, five, six! -[all] Champs! {\an8}[Crowder] Number 11, EMCC, and number 15, ICC, here in Fulton. [Winfield] I hope everybody that's left on our schedule is ranked in the top five, because that's how you're going to advance, is to beat some of those guys and to beat them bad. [Crowder] We're underway at Eaton Field. Coming out at quarterback is number 14, De'Andre Johnson, your MACJC Offensive Player of the Week. And also Isaiah Wright, who was injured in last week's ball game. The snap to Johnson, they give it to Wright. Wright tries to go between the tackles, breaks free. -He's gonna bounce to the outside. -[Williams] Come on! There you go! Keep going! There you go, Four! Let's go, let's go! [Crowder] First down. Ten to go. EMCC inside the 15. Here's the snap. And they give it up the middle to Isaiah Wright... inside the 5! Fumbles the football into the end zone. -[Wood] He fumbled the ball. -[Crowder] It's gonna be a touchback. And EMCC turns it over on their opening drive. [Kam] That nigga fumbles too much, son. [Wood] Ah, that worries me. [coach] Come on, Isaiah! Get your butt up! Let's go, Lions! [Beard] He never had a good handle on that football. [Crowder] Huge break for ICC, Glen. [Buddy] Don't get your ass blown up like that. Be a man and play! Be a man and play! Get over here with your team! [Isaiah] I'm straight! Damn, I'm good, I'm good! [Buddy] Don't sit on the ground and pout. People look at that. Do you understand? -[Isaiah] Yes, sir. -[Buddy] Next play! Listen to me! You stay in at running back. Hey, really good drive. Just got to finish it, and we will. Shake it off, next play. Look at me. It happens. Shake it off, move to the next play. [woman] Let's go, defense! [Winfield] Now, fortunately, the best unit on this team now, that defensive front in the ball game. Tim Bonner, Kam Carter, a lot of guys have stepped up and have made plays. [Crowder] Peyton Bender, turns and hands it off for Thomas. Thomas busts it right up the middle. Five... Touchdown. [stadium announcer] Touchdown, ICC! -[Ed Holly] We're there, we gotta play! -[Buddy] Jeez! [Ed Holly] We should be rolling these guys. So what we got to do is settle down, we got to stay in our scheme, do what we do and play Lion football. We're fine. Ah, fuck! I missed that shit. [Crowder] And here comes the offense now and, Glen, the mood kind of seems to have changed on that EMCC sideline, just observing the body language. Here's the snap. They leave it with Wright. Wright goes up the middle and he's gotten a first down as he dives forward to about the 42-yard line. [Isaiah] This shit fucking dead! [Crowder] Great inside run that time by Isaiah Wright. Inside hand off again, and he is just busting free. [Isaiah grunts] [Crowder] Isaiah Wright like a pinball, is gonna bounce off some would-be tacklers. [Isaiah] That shit fucking dead! [Crowder] Oh, what back-to-back runs by Isaiah Wright. [Winfield] Isaiah Wright, running like a guy who's mad that he fumbled, who wants to show that he deserves more carries. [Crowder] Johnson's gonna give it to Wright. Wright is gonna be tackled. He's gonna grab him by the waist and ride him to the ground. [Isaiah panting heavily] [Winfield] He'll come out of the game. [Isaiah] I got to throw up. I got to throw up! -I got to throw up. -[Bontrager] Why? [Isaiah] I don't know. [Bontrager] From the hit? Got a headache? -[Isaiah] Yeah. -[Bontrager] All right, you're done. [Isaiah] Fuck! -Out? -Yeah, it's not worth it. Okay. [Beard] Guys, he hasn't seen the field since the injury, and I think been ruled out for the remainder of the ball game. Double-Six, let's go! [Crowder] So, Johnson at the 20 of ICC. They're in the red zone. Quick snap by Johnson, gonna hand it to Horsley. Horsley goes right side, has real estate. Inside the 15. Stays on his feet, down the far sideline, dives to the goal line... He's into the end zone. Touchdown, EMCC! [cheering] [Wood] Way to go! Good job! Good job! -Let's go! Whoa! Let's go! -[cheering] [Crowder] We're tied at seven apiece here in Fulton, Mississippi. Isaiah's hurt. You're the punt guy. You got 'em. Good drive. Good drive. -[Isaiah] Fuck! -[Buddy] Hey, what's wrong? [Bontrager] Head. -[Buddy] Is he gonna be all right? Huh? -[Bontrager] Not tonight. [stutters] Why? He didn't get hit in the head. Isaiah didn't even get hit in the head. You can't run him three plays like that in a row, though. I mean, running the ball like that. -Hey, when did you get hit? Again? -Like, yeah... Yeah, 'cause they coming at me head-first, so I can't do nothing else but go... I got to go down with 'em. No, you don't, but here's the deal. [stammering] If you... You're gonna end up not playing the rest of the year, because you've got to take care of yourself, number one, you've got to get over it, first. You got to get over it first, okay? Come on, now. Hey, get up there with your team. Don't sit over here and sulk. Get over here with your team. Hey, you understand? -[Isaiah] Yes, sir. -[Buddy] Come on. [Crowder] Peyton Bender in the shotgun, turns and gives it to Matthews. Matthews hit in the backfield and he is gonna be dropped, for... close to a loss, as the coaches here... {\an8}[Buddy] Get him out. Get him out. Get him out. {\an8}Get him out. Get him out. Kam! Hey, go down. Go down right now, Kam. Go down. -What happened? Your shoulder? -[Kam] My arm. [Buddy] Stay there and quit acting like you're hurt. And stop it. Stop it. Stop it. [Kam grunts] [Buddy] You understand? -Stop it. Is it broke? -[Kam] Nah! -[Buddy] Get your butt up. -[Bontrager] Ready? -Ready to get to the sideline? -[Kam] Yeah, I'm good. -[Buddy] Come on. -[Bontrager] Come on. [Kam grunts] Oh, shit. [Buddy] You know, I hurt my knee one time. The trainer stood over me and told me to shut the F up. Quit hollering, yeah. Quit hollering. Want some Powerade? Try that one, that's better. Want some Powerade? -[referee 1] Yeah. -I'm bringing you Powerade. -[referee 2] Whoo! -[referee 1] Here we go. See what a great person I am? Come on, man, -I just gave you Powerade, dadgum! -[laughs] Jeez, almighty. [Williams] Man, y'all play with some energy out there, fellas! Let's go! [Crowder] EMCC on top by seven. Their defense trying to protect the red zone to the left... The snap to Ellington. -[Buddy] Ball! -And firing to the end zone, reaching up and catching it. That's gonna be a touchdown. [Buddy] Shit. [Williams] Our defense is killing us every drive. [Buddy] God damn, guys. Come on, Chauncey! Good grief. Boy, hey, Chauncey. Play! Make the dadgum tackle. {\an8}Y'all are making it way too damn easy for 'em. {\an8}[player] Hey, let's go, D! Refuse to be blocked. Okay? Play harder and refuse to be blocked. Play harder and refuse to be blocked. Do you understand? Hey. Get after 'em, okay? Get off the blocks, don't let 'em stay on you, and just play hard. We just have to start making the plays. Right now, we're just not making 'em. That's just how it is. We got to make the plays. [Crowder] 2:56 to go, and EMCC trying to break the tie. Johnson back to pass. Steps up as the pocket collapses, and he is gonna be hit and dropped. Shit. All right, let's go. Come on. Dadgum! [yells] [Crowder] Buddy Stephens is livid over on the far sideline. [Buddy] Hey, hey! Come here! Don't you get on the field and play that way ever again! You come off the ball! Come off the ball! Play hard! [coach] Watch out, watch out. Look, the next damn time we got a three-man rush, and we get a sack... Get your ass in here! And we get a sack on a three-man rush, I'll pull your rear end out. That's ridiculous! Both of you two were setting to him, and he just ran right around you. You... Listen to me. Continue to play hard. [Crowder] This has been a back-and-forth first half. 21-14, EMCC football at the ICC 19-yard line. 10,8 seconds left here in the first half. You gotta think end zone. [Winfield] You have to think end zone. [Wood] Be fast. Don't take a sack! [Buddy] Go for the end zone. {\an8}[Crowder] Johnson, raises that left leg. Here's the snap. {\an8}Nine seconds. Eight seconds. Steps up in the pocket. {\an8}Running with it. Pump fakes, {\an8}and he's gonna be inside the 20, the 15. {\an8}He's gonna be inside the 10. Gets to the outside, to the 5... {\an8}-[Buddy] No. Out of bounds. -[Wood] Yeah! Yeah! {\an8}[Crowder] They say the clock goes off but the whistle was blowing. -Oh, no! -Oh, no! You gotta be kidding me! [Crowder] Are you kidding? They're blowing the whistle and there was time on the clock. ICC's football team is jogging towards the locker room... -[Wood] No, no, no! That's bullcrap! -[Buddy] No, no. Hey, no! Line up, line up! -Field goal, line up. -[Wood] They got time! [Buddy] Line up! Field goal, line up. [Wood] No, sir. Field goal! [Crowder] Terrible clock management by the officials. Buddy Stephens is gonna have every right to be upset here. No, we're getting bullshit. Hey, that's horseshit right there. Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. That's horsecrap. It was a whole second. [Crowder] Oh, you go... Oh, my goodness gracious alive. No, that's the biggest bunch of horseshit I ever seen. -No, no, no, no. -[Wood] That's bad, ref! Hey, hey, no, no, no. That's horseshit. Hey, hey. How can you do that? How can you do that? That's ridiculous. [Wood] Come on, Buddy. Keep walking. That's ridiculous, guys. [Wood] That's awful. We had that. That's bullshit. That is ridiculous! [coach] Ain't nothin' you can do. They made that-- [Buddy] Wait a little. Hey, hey, let me know what they're paying. [Crowder] They'll take a seven-point lead into the half. 21-14, is our score. EMCC on top. [Buddy] Get inside, don't worry about the drink! Get inside! Hey, shut up now. Get out. Get out, right now. Okay? Or get back here. Hey. Get your ass back there, where you ain't between me and a player. I done told y'all's ass that. Hey, listen to me. You are letting them stay around, okay? And some of you guys that do all this yapping about how good you are, you ain't showed it yet. Some of you getting your rear end burned. You getting your rear end blocked. Hey, at times, they're outplaying you. But you are good enough athletes to overcome that. At some point, you've gotta say, "I'm gonna put 'em away." All I expect you to do is to go out and outplay them. Outplay them! Some of you guys that talk about how good you are, outplay them! We're the number one fucking D-line in the country. -Let's show them that shit. -Let's go. Get it in here. Let's go, guys! Let's go, son. Let's go. It's time to fucking eat, man. Let's go, man. Let's go. Get in here. Chauncey, let's go. -D-line on three. One, two, three. -[all] D-line! -Come on, guys. -Let's fucking go, man. Get some fucking fire, son. I don't... I ain't losing you for the year. Bro, don't tell me I can't play, man. I'm about to get really pissed. Look, you can get pissed. -We're not losing you. -Bro, I'm fine. [player] He don't want you to get hurt worse. He protecting you. You feel me? I don't give a damn about me, dog. I wanna play football. I wanna play football. [player] You get hit, you might not play the next game. I don't care. I wanna play football. [player] You rather play half a game or a full game? I'll die playing this damn sport. I don't care. [player] I feel you. I would wanna play too. I feel you. Bro, that's two games I done missed. I mean, it's a slight-ass headache, bro. Everybody get hurt and they sit out. Come on. -Man, I'm not sitting out, bro. -[Kam] Come on, bro. That shit fucking dead. No, fuck that. Fuck that. [Mario] Don't be selfish like that, bro. How am I being selfish? [Mario] We got a whole team. Still stay up, bro. How am I being selfish? You the captain, dog. So niggas look up to you. That's what them coaches wanna see your ass do. Bitch. Don't bitch for these coaches, damn. Man, fuck all these coaches, to be honest, dog. I don't give a damn, dog. This nigga just took my fucking life, man. Football's my shit! And I can't fucking play? That's fucked up! [Buddy] Hey, hey. Play smart. Hey, gang tackle. Whip their ass this half. Now, let's go. Hey. Break it down, right now. [Winfield] Buddy Stephens, a little less than satisfied as play begins in the second half. ICC'll have it. [Crowder] Spot of the football near their own 36. He's gonna hand it off to Matthews. Matthews slips a tackle in the backfield. He busts free, and he's gonna get out across midfield, he's gonna be inside the 45, the 40. He's running down the far sideline, inside the 20. He's gonna be tackled from behind. Get Zeke out. Get Zeke out, now! [Crowder] Receiver comes in motion. They give it to the tailback, Thomas goes straight up the middle and he is going to carry folks into the end zone. Touchdown. [Ed Holly] We had 'em in the backfield. We had 'em in the backfield, and we're missing tackles. That's just not motivated football. [Williams] That's on us. That whole fucking series is on us. Offsides, not tackling the damn guy in the backfield. That's our fault! We gave 'em seven damn points. Us! They ain't doing nothing we can't stop. Stay outside! {\an8}A 40 fucking... 70-yard damn touchdown {\an8}all because you can't keep your outside damn shoulder free. Do I have somebody that can play? -Do I have somebody that can play? -[player] I can play, Coach! We gotta fight for our motherfucking life. -We can't give up. We can't break. -[Kam] Fuck that shit. [Winfield] The one thing we have not seen all year is this EMCC defense just really on its heels tonight. Boy, something has to change. Hey, this is our time! It's time to ball. None of this crap. Hey, Chauncey, right now, this is our time. We own this time in history. We gotta stick the dagger in their frickin' heart. Let's go! [Crowder] Motion left to right, and now they're swinging it out of the backfield and it is caught. Up across the 30, near sideline, out across the 40-yard line, and he has some room. That's Matthews inside the 30, middle of the field, -inside the 20, the 15. -No! Ten, five. Touchdown, ICC. And that's just poor tackling by EMCC there. [Ed Holly] Make the freaking tackle. Make sure everybody knows what the goddamn play is. -They gotta tighten up. -[Ed Holly] God dang it! They gotta tighten up. [Buddy] Ed! I can't keep doing this, Ed. Come on, now. -They're not 28 points good, guys. Okay? -[Ed Holly] You're right. Bullshit, bro. That's just them wanting it more, bro. That's just them wanting it more. [De'Andre] Hey, y'all, huddle up, huddle up. We love games like this. It's time for us to put on a fucking show. Let's go. This is where you see what you made of at. That's how you know you're a championship team. Battling through adversity. Hey, I don't know about y'all, but I love this shit. I love this. I love this game. I'm ready to put on a show. Whoo! [Crowder] De'Andre Johnson, the transfer from Florida State, out of Jacksonville, Florida. -Spot of the football at the 16. -[Buddy] Go! It's gonna be Johnson running, inside the 10, -inside the 5, towards the goal line! -[Buddy] Touchdown! [Crowder] Touchdown, EMCC! Yes! Yes! [Wood] Yes, sir! Yes, sir! [Crowder] You can't rattle De'Andre Johnson, guys. What a run by Johnson. Great job. Great job. Great job. -Good job, baby. -[Crowder] It's 28 all. 3:24 to go in the third quarter. Johnson looking left, fires it left, it's wide with a receiver cut at the 40-yard line. Sidesteps a would-be tackler, and he's off to the races. He's got one man to beat, inside the 20, inside the 15, and he's gonna be tackled. [Winfield] Now, you gotta take advantage right here. [Crowder] EMCC trying to break the tie. And firing it over the middle, caught by Lanier. Touchdown, EMCC! [Williams] Yes! Yes! [Buddy] Way to go, guys. Atta way to go. Good job, baby. [players cheering] -[De'Andre] Great job, baby. -[Wood] Give me some! [Winfield] Just go right back down the field and score and take that lead again, and that's a very big drive led by Johnson right there. These are the funnest games, man. I love these games. I live for this. This is where you see what you made of at, man. See if you're a champion, or if you're a loser. [Williams] Hey, let's go, D. Let's go, D. We need more of that shit. [Crowder] Here's the snap to Bender. Bender looking to throw it right side, wide-open receiver at the 45. Caught down the far sideline, and he's off to the races. [Buddy] Oh, my God. He's wide open. [Crowder] Ten, five... Oh, my goodness, what just happened? Touchdown. [De'Andre] Are you serious? Let's go do it again. Hey, let's go do it again. [Ed Holly] We're in Cover-freaking-Two! We're in Cover-Two, Coach. We get it, we'll get it. Cover-Two! Guys, this is getting embarrassing now. We're giving the game away. [Buddy] I thought Ed knew his shit. I think he's soft. I don't think they work on tackling. Come on, let's go! [Crowder] Spot of the football is the four-yard line. Johnson with a snap and a quick slant, caught! Touchdown, EMCC! -[De'Andre] Great job, boy. -[Wood] Good job! [Winfield] We have an offensive shootout going on here. [Crowder] Firing it deep down the field and caught in the end zone. Touchdown from 30 yards out. Goodness! Hey, we fighting our ass off, man! Let's tighten the fuck up, man! Fuck! Let's tighten up, man! [Buddy] Come on, let's go, Holly! Let's go, Ed! Tighten up! [Crowder] Here's a big third down for EMCC. Lions are on top, 44-42, with 48,4 seconds left. A first down ends it. [Buddy] You got two downs, Marcus. I don't think we can kick it from here. [Crowder] Johnson receives it. Steps up in the pocket. Now scrambles and can't bounce... No, he breaks a couple of tackles and stays on his feet. -I don't know how he did. -[players grunting] Down to the 35, so that's gonna bring up a fourth down. [Winfield] Well, Johnson's helmet came off, so if you were going for it, you're gonna have to do it without Johnson. [Wood] Vijay, let's go. [Beard] Vijay in the game, guys. [Crowder] Vijay Miller is gonna quarterback. -[De'Andre] Fuck! -[Buddy] Oh, dear Jesus, guys. I don't like it. I don't like it. -[man] Gotta have it. Gotta have it. -Gotta have this. [De'Andre] Fire the fuck off the ball. [Crowder] This fourth down and eight, EMCC is gonna go for it. [man] This is the play of the game. This is the play of the game. [Crowder] Miller back to pass. Has trouble. Rolls to his right. [Buddy] Shit, shit, shit. Oh, God. -Still rolling, squares, fires. -[Wood] Make a play! [Crowder] Has a man... Caught! And EMCC inside the 20. [cheering] [Crowder] First down, Lions! Oh, my goodness! And EMCC just put the nail in the coffin. [Wood] Yes, sir! Yes, sir! [De'Andre] Hell of a job, Three. [Winfield] What a play by Miller, the freshman. [Crowder] Play of the game. -[Winfield] That's a big throw. -Go, Lions! [Crowder] We're gonna see the old victory formation kneel down. -That'll run out the clock. -[whistle blows] [player 1] Baby, we good. -[player 2] We gonna do it. -[player 1] We good. Keep on balling. [Crowder] What a ball game. This has been a good one, and EMCC now runs their record to 3-1 on the season. -[ICC coach] Hell of a game. -[Buddy] That was a hell of a game. Good job, guys. Y'all played great. Defense, hey, tonight was our turn to pick you up. You've been picking us up, it was our turn. De'Andre, where you at? Andre? I don't give game balls, but you did a hell of a job tonight, son. -Hey, hey, hey, great job. -[players cheer] Tremendous fight, great heart. Let's go back and let's get better. Let's get better starting tomorrow. [Isaiah] I'm about to quit this dumb shit, man. [Wilkerson] Isaiah. Isaiah, calm down. -Nah, you guys took me out. -No, no. Hey, listen. Listen, we won the game. Listen, calm down. We won the game. We won the game, all right? -I don't really even care, bro. -Yeah, you've gotta care. -I'm done. -Don't get like this. Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. I know you're mad. I get it. But you can't act out. You can't be disrespectful. -Learn to control yourself. -Disrespectful with who? Me.
