 [crowd cheering] [announcer 1] And EMCC is up 48-nothing. DJ Law was looking up field. That's gotta be a targeting penalty and it is. And then Law's gonna get up and slap him in the helmet. [indistinct yelling] [Buddy] No, no, no. Hey, hey! Get back! Get back in here! No! No! [yelling continues] Get back, get back, get back. DJ Law, Coach!

 They got him over there! They stomping him, man! They stomping him, Coach! Get back. Get back. Hey! [announcer 1] This is out of control. [announcer 2] Oh, my goodness. -We've got guys swinging helmets. -[whistle blowing] This is totally out of control. Hey! Get back. Hey! Get back! [announcer 2] Total frustration. [announcer 3] They have to get security out here fast... [announcer 2] Players throwing their helmets, busting their facemasks... -[whistle blowing] -[player] Punch that nigga, man! Like I can't punch that nigga! Punch that nigga! [announcer 2] This is ugly, folks. This is just downright ugly.

 And they have security out there that's doing absolutely nothing. They may have to call this game. No, no, bullshit! Fuck all that bullshit, man! That nigga won't do shit! On my mama! [Buddy] Yo, get back. Get back. Hey, shut the fuck up. Don't talk to my guys. Shut the fuck up. You shut the-- Come get my ass, then, damn it! I'll beat your bitch ass! Promise you that. Get back, man. Chill. -I'll tell you what! -That's my coach! Well, get his fucking hands off of me! Don't put your fucking hands on my coach, man! Damn these motherfuckers! Shut the fuck up and get on the side! Shut the fuck up and get on the side! [announcer 2] We may finally have some control. DJ Law's jersey's been ripped. He was by himself and he had three guys swinging at him. [Buddy] Get the fuck over there! Get your ass over here, too! [announcer 2] This is the kind of thing that can hurt only one team. And that's the team that has a chance to advance. [announcer 1] We're seeing this because EMCC beats people so badly. Frustrations boil. And that's what's happened in this game. [Buddy] Shut up! Get your ass in here. Now! Get your ass in here! Now let me tell you something, you just probably cost your chance at a National Championship. 'Cause they ain't gonna let you play next week. Watch what happens! Because I got dumbasses that can't damn listen. I told you before we started what would happen. But you ain't got the pride or the heart not to let it happen. -[indistinct shouting] -Shut up! I don't give a damn! No, man! Fuck all that, man! -Bro, that's fucked up, bro! -Hey, shut up! Hey, hey, hey! Shut up! I won't do it. I won't coach you if that's what you got. Because all I saw was thug bullshit. We talked about having more pride, but you didn't want to. You wanna be damn street thugs, so I'll tell you what. Go find another damn school to go to. 'Cause we ain't gonna be damn street thugs. Now I'm telling you what's gonna happen. I'm fixin' to walk out there and they're gonna say, "Hey, both teams have to forfeit the game." That gives you a loss. Or they're gonna go out there and say, "Hey, everybody that left the sidelines can't play next week." And that will happen. Because we tried to tell you! "No. Hell, no." "I'mma go take care of somebody." "I'mma go talk to somebody." "I'mma go help somebody." Horseshit! I hope they tell us we can't play. Maybe it will be something that you, by God, will listen to. And you ain't got nobody to blame but the guy in the mirror. 'Cause you didn't have to do that! None of you did! That's horseshit. I won't be a damn part of it. Get me another damn job! Move. Hell, no. You gonna fight! Man, you just got suspended. Coach! You just got suspended. What the fuck? [Wood] Listen to me. Hey! Hey! Let's see what happens. Don't worry about that, get your head right. Let's go. We gotta finish the game. Let's go finish the game. Let's go. [player] What they want us to do, bro? What fucking kind of coach says that, bro? [Trickett] We good. Don't turn on your goddamn coach. [Mario] I understand that. [Trickett] What if we get a loss? We don't play in the National Championship. That's the only fucking thing that we came back for. So let's do that. It's a lose-- It's a lose-lose situation. Bro, ain't no way-- It ain't no way around it, bro. You taking the arrow regardless, bro. [Ollie] That just fucked up everything. That just fucked up everything we had, bro. -It's over, bro. It's over. -[player] Game over, huh. We ain't about to let them get jumped, bro. Hell, no, bro! We family out here. Bro, I've been with y'all for two years, bro! [stammers] I squared off with 92, straight up. I took off with his ass. Six of them came after me. I don't give a fuck about none of that shit. [referee] You can only do so much because we are talking about young men. And you knew, no matter what we did, no matter how we handled it, somebody was gonna get out of hand like it just did. We have 98 white, 99 white, 12 white. [Buddy] Ejections or... or violent ejections? [referee] Oh, these are fighting ejections. So that is violent. [Buddy] Okay. [referee] Okay. All right. And again-- [Buddy stuttering] Which totally screws us. It's all right, though. It's all right, though. [referee] All we can do is try to get to the middle of it. [Buddy] Piece of shit. [referee] Three, six, eighty-five... [Buddy] He knows it. [referee] Three, Six... We get it, Coach. If we have one more comment, we're just gonna leave this-- [Buddy] Well, might as well go ahead and leave it. [referee] All right, then we gonna leave. We're gonna leave it. [Buddy] Ninety-eight, stand up. Ninety-nine, stand up. Twelve, stand up. Eleven, stand up. One, stand up. Where's one? One, stand up. Where's he at? [shouts] One! You guys decided to dance, you guys gotta pay the fiddler. The guys that are standing up will no longer play here. They have a two-game suspension for the rest of the year. Ball game's over. Go get dressed. Get on the bus. Let's go. Hey, ain't nobody gonna be mad at nobody. Look in the mirror. [Trickett] Hey, D! D, come in with me. Let him go. I got him. He's coming in with me. -Let's go inside. -Walk in with me. Walk in with me. -Walk in with me. Walk in with me. -[DJ] I love you, boy. [Trickett] I got him. You good? [Dario] Man, they taking that shit from us, brother. -The refs ain't doing shit! -I know. We good, we good. [John] Bitch-ass niggas, man. I can't play for no soft-ass coach like that. He just showed me a lot, bro. Soft-ass. [Buddy] Y'all's ball game is done. Y'all's ball game is done. Y'all's ball game is done. Go. I asked y'all to handle shit. You didn't handle it. -I can't help-- Hey, I can't help-- -[referee] Come on, Buddy. [Buddy] No, no, no. No, no. Hey, I-- No, I didn't? Shit, I'm the one that begged your damn ass. I begged your damn ass. I'm okay. You piece of shit. Bring your ass back over here and let me whip your ass. Come on, bring your ass back over here and let me whip your ass. [Isaiah] Weak-ass shit, man. That's some weak-ass shit. [player] Man, fuck them. Taking our shit away from us, man, like that. Y'all took our shit away from us like that. That's some bullshit, man. That's some straight bullshit, man. They took that shit away from us like that, man. [Jawon] Come on, man. Come on. Man, that's bullshit. That's fucking bullshit, man! Fuck these niggas up! [Marcel] Fuck them fuckin' niggas, boy! Fuckin' pussy shit! [officer] What's the player's name, right here? [Buddy] I don't know. -You don't know? -I don't know. [officer] Well, he fixin' to go to jail if you don't... [Buddy] No, ain't nobody going to jail 'cause you gotta file... you gotta file reports. We had someone-- -I'll file a report against you, too! -What am I going to jail for? -What am I going to jail for? -Okay? -Tell me what I'm going to jail for. -Coach! Coach! -Come on, come on. Come on. -Tell me what I'm going to jail for. [Buddy] I don't know who you're pointing to, damn it! Come on, Coach! Come on, Coach! I'mma always fight for y'all, bro. -Thanks, man. -[Allenzae] Coach Stephens... Coach Stephens come in my face with that dumb shit, I'mma punch his ass. I don't give a fuck, man. Ain't no fuckin' coach supposed to be talkin' like this, man! [Buddy] Shit! The next word that you use of profanity, you're going to jail. Next what, now, sir? The next word you use of profanity, you're going to jail. What did I say? What did I say? What you talking to my coach for like that, bro? [Buddy] Why are you grabbing me, huh? Why are you grabbing me? I want charges on him for putting his hands on me for no reason. Go on in the locker room, Coach. Coach, come on. Let's go in the locker room. -Come on, let's go. Come on. -Go head on in the locker room, then. Coach, how y'all let that shit go down like that, man? You can't react like that. -Man, they did that shit, man! -What you mean we can't react like that? [indistinct shouting] We on their side of the field, man! -Fuck that shit, man! -What the fuck? [siren blares] [Buddy] What's done is done. I never, in a million years, would imagine that this season would end up like this. 'Cause they baited y'all into that the whole ball game. They ain't got nothing to lose, they just took out the number three team in the country... by getting in your head... [player exhales sharply] ...and planning on your redneck, hood, thug attitude -would come out. -[indistinct angry muttering] -[Buddy] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. -What the fuck you talking about? You knew who the fuck I was when you recruited me, homeboy. [Buddy] Well, do you got it? Shut up! You acted like a-- I mean, wild maniacs... in a street fight. Call it whatever you want. You weren't taking up for your buddy. That ain't what it was about! [Lesley] They could have killed DJ Law. Could have killed him. And didn't a damn one of their coaches stop them. Yeah, well. It's part of it. Yeah, I guess. [indistinct chatter] [player] Oh, we gotta get going. [Ollie] That's the white man, bro. Welcome to the real world. That's the white man. Welcome to the real world. We can't do shit about it. It's over. [Ollie] Coach Stephens don't give a fuck about us. He don't give a fuck about us. Y'all heard that shit he was saying, right? He don't give a fuck! I'm letting y'all niggas know. I know that shit, on my mama. [indistinct chatter] He don't give no fuck, bro! He don't give no fuck about damn one of us, man. Tell you what he worried about, man. He worried about his motherfucking juice, bro. It's the only thing he care about. He worried about his juice. How much juice Coach Stephens got? How much rank he got? Nigga don't give a fuck! I don't need that nigga for shit. Been living by myself for... nigga, 12, 13 years. Ain't never had a nigga to give me shit. [player] Nigga don't even call out one motherfuckin' play. [Isaiah] Yeah, we was... we was out there helping him out. {\an8}The whole team, he was fighting the whole team. {\an8}Coming from the same motherfucker that just got suspended two weeks ago {\an8}for fighting a damn referee. {\an8}But we thugs and rednecks. So what the fuck that make you? The leader of the thugs and rednecks. [Isaiah] The leader of the thugs. [chuckles] Exactly. The leader of the fucking thugs and rednecks. [Wyatt] I think he lost a lot of respect. He really did, bro. You show your true colors when you're mad, and he said what he had to say, so just leave it at that, bro. [stutters] A lot of them boys don't even want to play for him. [Wood] I know I had two or three people comment to me today, that you guys did a great job staying on the sideline for a long time. Then finally, just... couldn't stand there anymore, we got guys getting kicked to death and everything else, so... You did a good job with what you had. [player chuckles] I would rather recruit guys that's gonna stick up for themselves {\an8}and their brothers in time of need... {\an8}than guys that are gonna sit back and just let things happen. No, no. [Luke] I've seen a lot of slack on Facebook and stuff about, {\an8}"You were ahead of 'em 48 points and it's 59 seconds left. {\an8}Before halftime, you call two time-outs to try to score again." But in order to move up, especially when you're number three, they go by a point spread system. And if you want what's best for your team... you're gonna try to get 'em at least number two so you can play in the National Championship. [Salter] When you run the score up like that... {\an8}-that leaves marks. -[Wagner] Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. I don't mind beating 'em, but we're so much better. Well, they're-- But... Yeah. I just... I don't know. It's like kicking somebody when they're down, you know? They teach you not to do that. -And then on Facebook, you see this-- -Uh, well... {\an8}I know. Yeah, now that makes me furious. {\an8}-"Thugs. They're all thugs." -That makes me... {\an8}How the hell can you say that? You don't even know one of them. When you do the kind of things we're doing, it does wind up hurting those kids. [Jay grunts] And that's... that's the bad part. -[Wagner] Hey, Jay. -What's up? How you doing? -Come on in here and sit down. -What you doing, bud? Nah, I just come here to visit. [Wagner] Well, this year, it's like we can't do anything right. To me, when your program starts, when any program gets to that point where it's just one thing after another... [sighs] usually that's the beginning of the end. {\an8}EMCC is leading 48 to nothing, when officials decide to stop play. {\an8}[newscaster 1] It is a full-on fight out there. [newscaster 2] Calling two time-outs before halftime, while up 48-nothing. [newscaster 3] Up 48-nothing? Have some class. Just have some respect for your opponent in the game. [newscaster 4] You don't want somebody to get up 48-nothing. Stop 'em. -What in the world's going on, man? -[man] We've seen it before. Coach Stephens got into some problems with the officials... [newscaster 5] No word on punishment for this. EMCC is slated to begin the playoffs as the number one seed next week. A bombshell today. {\an8}EMCC has been disqualified from the upcoming MACJC football playoff. {\an8}Officials there say they do plan to appeal the decision, to try to get back in. But as for now, East Mississippi has been banned from post-season play. Mama, I could give a shit. [door creaks open] I don't watch CNN. I don't give a shit about CNN. Mama, I'm not trying to be an asshole, but, I mean, come on. -Love you, too. -[man] We should get a caravan. Bye. Ethan Orr just tweeted, "Our season is over." [Lesley] Tell him to stop tweeting. Kids these days... [Lesley] I hate it for a sophomore. I'm talking about guys like Tillman and Ollie and them, that are on the bubble of getting the offer that they want... [man] Yeah, yeah. -[clears throat] Now it's gone. -[man] Yeah. [indistinct chatter] [interviewer] Ollie, where you trying to go play? No fucking where. The crib. [all laughing] [interviewer] Have you got an offer yet? [Ollie] Nope. Has anybody got an offer? [both] Nope. [Marcel chuckles] They said if we win, they gonna come. But we ain't win. [chuckles] -So them bitches ain't coming. -[Marcel chuckles] They ain't coming. [Williams] There's a Division I school that, you know, we're gonna send a tape out to about for Ollie. Ollie missed three games this year because of a concussion. This particular D-I school said, "Hey, we need some tape." He doesn't have enough tape. He doesn't have enough tape to, you know, for them to make a proper evaluation. Guess how many games we would have played if we would've went all the way? Three. First round of the playoffs, second round of the playoffs, then the National Championship game. So he would have got those three games back. [Marcel] You ain't going to class for real? It's pointless. If Wyatt said he ain't going to class, I definitely ain't going to class. [Ollie] It's over with. You might as well come on. [Ollie] Everybody leaving. Everybody leave? Man, listen, ain't nobody gonna be here, bro. [Marcel] That's a wrap! [Wagner] Oh, everybody missed on Monday. Three pages of absences. Practically the whole team didn't go to class. DJ Law walked out of class-- [frustrated grunt] [sighs] -You got dropped. -I already knew that. [sighs] Why? [DJ] From algebra class? No. Don't tell me you got dropped from that, too. Uh-uh. Can't miss English or algebra no more. [Wagner] You can't miss anything anymore. Because you have three in English, you have three in history, and you have five in math. Okay. So I can't miss nothing, nothing. -No class no more. -No. [Wagner] A part of me appreciates the fact that he comes in here and basically tell me he got dropped. And he's smiling and like, "I got ya," attitude like he's not defeated. A part of me totally appreciates that and, like, loves him for that. And then there's a part of me that it just pisses me off. Only got dropped from one class, right? [Wagner] So far. But don't... [stutters] Are you... Do you know something I don't know? -[laughs] No, I'm just asking. -[Wagner chuckles] 'Cause everybody else... everybody else got dropped and I'm like, um, just one class. Gotta get the rest of them. Yeah, I need... yeah. You've got to make an "A" in Castleberry. -Got to? -Mmm-hmm. -In Castleberry? -Mmm-hmm. You cannot make a "B." All right. Ain't got nothing else to do. [Wood] It's a bad deal. Just a bad deal. {\an8}It's a bad deal for some good kids. {\an8}[Buddy] But still, Marcus, I keep going back to the decision that they made when they ran their butt on the field. [sighs] I'm the same way. I'd have been the same way. But at that point-- [Wood] They were off the field, though, till the second... the skirmish breaks out and the kid's getting just stomped to death, you know. Still, you let the referees handle that and let that-- [Wood] But they didn't, the refs left. -The ref went away. [chuckles] -I know. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Tried to play a game. Tried to do it right. It's unbelievable. Bad deal, man. I'm not trying to condone running on to the field, I'm not saying that, but... if you watch the video, you'll see 'em, our guys stay back, and stay back, and stay back, and then... I don't know, at some point, you gotta protect 'em. I'd want my kid protected. I don't know. But... [sniffs] nothing you can do. Nothing you can do. [clamoring on television] [man 1 on radio] The coach has a rep already. He's already been, uh, ejected from a game and fined or whatever. To me, that's a trickle-down effect to the team. [man 2] Why are you calling two time-outs to get the ball back up 48 to zero? [man 1] Exactly. [man 2] We're hearing they may not be able to participate in the playoffs. [man 3] That's ridiculous. You're gonna make them not play in the playoffs because of a fight? It's a man's game. Men fight. We've been in Ecclesiastes, right? "Life is monotonous, life is mysterious, life is unpredictable and life is unfair." That's from Solomon. It is unpredictable. It is unfair sometimes. So now we have to deal with it. [photocopier beeps] [Wagner] I have been told that there is a meeting happening today with all the important people. Um, our president, our athletic director, Buddy, our school attorney, and then the commissioner. We have appealed their decision to disqualify us, um, from the playoffs. So... you know, fingers are crossed, I guess, that they overturn that decision and that they let us play. [Buddy stammering] Now, I had a lot of words. And I have to apologize for a lot of words that I had after the game. Because after watching the video, I'm damn proud of y'all. I'm damn proud of you. Because I don't think you acted in a thuggish manner. I think, by God, you were out there taking care of each other. And I'm proud of you. No matter what happens. I'm proud of this team and I'm proud to be the head coach here. And I'm proud of you. But what happened on that football field was already in motion before that game ever started. Okay? Hit the lights for me, please. You see our guys, we leave the bench, but our guys are composed enough to listen to their coaches. But their bench is entirely cleared. One of Delta's coaches here, just walks off and leaves Reed on the ground. {\an8}And somewhere around here, number 70 uses a helmet. {\an8}This is the exact video that the NJCAA got to look at and rule on our appeal. [murmuring] Now, we... Hey, listen to me. No matter... No matter what happens, okay? No matter what happens, I promise you, you've been fought for. 'Cause I'm going to tell you something. I'm not going to have my name, your name, and this college's name drug around by a bunch of... by a bunch of people that didn't really care. Okay? We're going to continue doing what we do. 'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop this train. We've said that from the get-go. [indistinct chatter] I just got a Twitter message. And it's from fuckin' Rhett Lashlee. Who's that? He's the offensive coordinator from Auburn. -I see you, John Franklin. -That's you. That's you. [Wagner] He's got an "A" in Western Civ II. A "B" in Human Growth and Development. He's in good shape. [over phone] Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You're welcome. Okay. Bye-bye. It's Auburn calling about John Franklin. They offered him on Friday. I'll be there with you, bro. I'm going on all five of my visits, though, just for vacation. -Got to. Where you gonna go, bro? -[Ollie] Hell yeah! Every weekend. Every weekend. I'm not staying here no longer than I got to. Yo. The Auburn scout, man, that was nothing but God, because Wyatt ends up getting hurt and then I end up scoring six touchdowns before halftime. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, you can't think that's gonna happen the day before the game. It's just something that just happens and you'll be like, "Man, that was my opportunity and I made the most of that opportunity." I feel bad for y'all, though. 'Cause y'all got a whole other year of this bullshit. [both laughing] That shit ain't funny. That shit is funny, 'cause I'm out. And I ain't coming back. I'm gonna talk to y'all through Twitter, though. -[Ollie yells] -I ain't coming back, though. -Ollie, you coming back? [chuckles] -Coming back for what? For what? -Coming back for what? -I ain't coming back for nothing. Nothing, boy. I ain't even walking. -John, I ain't even walking. -I ain't walking either, 'cause it's over. It's over with. December here, I'm gone. [Williams] Listen, listen. Supposedly, we're supposed to hear something back tonight. Or today. Don't know when it's gonna be, but... One thing we don't want y'all guys to do is lose your mindset as far as playing. -[Marcel] Yo. -Okay? All right? So, you know... I know some of you may feel, still, still feel some type of way about some things that was said. But if you get an opportunity to play, guys, that's... that's out the door. Okay? Now, I don't know where we at. We dropped to number ten in the country, you know? Fuck that. We just want to play for the state. [Williams] Come here. Hey. What's that attitude for? 'Cause, man... Because what? Because this shit's over with. I don't know, man. Man, stop acting like that, man. This is a rough time for everybody. I know. Don't be negative right now, Ollie. Don't nobody know what the fuck's going on. We're trying to prepare mentally for a game. You don't want to play no more? Huh? I'm gonna play. That ain't my question. Do I want to? No. [Williams] After here you don't wanna play? [Buddy] Ollie! What? [Buddy] You don't want to play a playoff game? Ah, it'll help, but... It'll help what? It'll help recruiting, but there ain't shit happening now, so... Huh? Ain't shit happenin' now, so, I mean... What do you mean? -I mean-- -[stammers] Who got-- Who got offered by Auburn because of their game? -John Franklin. -Yeah, because of the game. The recruiting stuff ain't over. What did I tell y'all last year? [stammering] The more games you play, the more people-- Come. [Buddy] The recruitment will come. You know what I'm saying? You don't want that last ball game to be your last ball game. -[Ollie] No. -You know what I'm saying? Just have a good attitude and go out there and let's have a good day. All right? I'mma punch your butt in the nose. All right? Go on. I'mma punch you in the nose, now. [Wagner] What's wrong with him? Think he should be getting offers that, you know... at least, like, Memphis and... like FCS offers-- Why would you not at this point entertain all offers? I don't know. Why did he tell SEMO he was better than them? -He told them that? -Yes. Like, he actually told them? [Wagner stammering] In a Twitter message. The coach sent it to me last night at 7:30. They're pissed. [Marcel] He had to be... Not to be rude, but-- "At Coach, I can't see myself playing there. I really think I'm better than that. I know I don't have anything going on, but I guess it is what it is. Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity." [Marcel] Why would he say that? Man. -He has one offer, and it's them. -Yeah. They're a Division I double-A. Like, what the freak? Right. The guy told me when he was here the other day, he said, "We've got one junior college player in the whole country that we're taking this year." And it's him, and then he sends him that message. He ain't want to talk to UAB yesterday. -[Wagner] Ollie? -Yeah. Why would he not talk to UAB? Like... Hmm, I don't know. That's a tough one, the guy was waiting on Ollie. -Guess he-- -Has anybody talked to him? Like, any of our coaches, like... pulled him aside and talked to him about, like, what he's doing? Nope. I don't know what he wants. I don't know where he wants to go. I know where he wants to go. He wants to go to Auburn. Well, guess what. They don't want you. -Yeah? -So... [Marcel] You gotta face the music. What he wants is irrelevant at this point. You gotta take what you're getting. [indistinct chatter] [player 1] This is disappointing. On some "what if" type shit. What if. [player 2] What if I won the lottery right now? That shit is stupid, bro. Ah! What if, what if we... After practice they get a call. "Oh! Y'all won't be playing." We just had a 'what if' practice for no fucking reason. Wasting my time. [indistinct chatter] I got mad at my bunch after the game and... after it was over with, and you just go, "I wished I'd have just watched the film first." Because I saw exactly how good they did do. All right, we got offense. -[indistinct shouting] -[whistle blows] [Buddy groaning] You can't let 'em twist! You cannot let 'em twist on 30. You gotta get to 'em, and drive 'em. Fuck that shit. I just want to get high. Just wanna get high? A blunt and brainstorm. I don't even wanna brainstorm. I just wanna get high as fuck. Tonight, if we end up making this thing, I need everybody to be positive, okay? -All right? You do that? -Okay. Okay. I love you. And I wanna tell you somethin', that I promise you that we're gonna... If we get to play, we gonna win these two games, you gonna play in the National Championship. -I got you. -I love you, bro. -Love you, too, Coach. -Take care. You got your fields planted? So the rain's in good? You going to take me and my daughter one time? Yeah. I gotta good spot to shoot. I want her to kill a deer. Oh, I got you. I got a good spot. [cell phone chimes] [Buddy] Received email that appeal has been denied. It was unanimous with one abstention. [whistle blowing] [Buddy] Everybody up! Let's go! All right. Here we go. Hey. All right. Got an email or text message from the president. He said our appeal was denied. Um, so, what it is, is what it is. You know, I'm gonna tell you something. I still stand by what I said earlier, I'm very proud of you. I'm very proud of the way that you've handled yourselves. Uh, one of the best football teams I've ever been associated with. Period. You will have your chance for vindication, but you have to understand... life ain't fair all the time, all right? Fair is where you kiss a pig and give it a blue ribbon. It ain't fair all the time. All right? And that's all I can say. I love you. We're gonna break it down. We're gonna get together, say the prayer. We're gonna break it down one last time. And we're gonna make sure-- Hey. I want everybody to hear this. All right? Everybody, get in here tight. Everybody. Get in here tight. Let's go. Our Father... [all] Who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. -[all] Amen. -Break it down. Let's go! [player] "Lions" on three, "Champs" on six. -One, two, three! -[players] Lions! -Four, five, six! -[players] Champs! [Wood] Offense! Offense! On behalf of these coaches, you're the state champs in our book, okay? So... I enjoyed it. All right? Love y'all. [player] D-block on me! "D-block" on three! -One, two, three! -[players] D-block! [laughter] [inaudible] [indistinct] [chain saw revving] [Luke stammering] It's a sad way for the season to go out. Maybe some rules need to change as far as, uh... officiating. What I did see on the field was one of our players getting very abused, and nobody taking control of it. I believe a little more research should've went in it before we got disqualified... but that's just my opinion, and I'm a maintenance man. [chuckles] [player laughing] [Wagner] Ollie, let's talk about this visit you were gonna take this weekend. Is there a way that you could've handled that situation better? What you mean? [Wagner] The situation with SEMO. Uh-uh. What are they saying? What you mean? Sending 'em a message that you're too good to play there. -I didn't say that, bro. -Yeah, you did. I read it. -It wasn't that, though. I didn't say-- -That's what you said. Uh, no. You're making it seem like I was just being a ass about it. Is it because you don't wanna fly? No, it ain't that. I just think I'm better than that. [Marcel] What school? [Ollie] Southeastern Missouri. [Wagner] But what if that's your only offer at the end of the day? It just... This is what it is. [Wagner] Well, what's plan B then? Then what're you gonna do? I don't know. [stammers] I don't know. It just is what it is, I guess. It just gonna be what it is. [Wagner] Well, no, it is what it is because you sent a Twitter message. I'm saying, like, I ain't have... I ain't got his number or nothing. [Wagner] I do. And the dude'll drive five hours to come pick you up. He already told me that. "I'll drive ten hours in one day if that's what it's gonna take to get him here. Because we want him to come on this visit." If it's about flying... -[stammers] It ain't-- -...then, like, that's one thing. They'll come get you. They want you bad enough. They're-- Do you understand that they're taking one D-lineman in the entire country, and you're the guy? If you have no interest and you don't give a shit, then fine, I'll tell 'em. [John] You scared to fly? I ain't no fool, unless... I ain't scared to fly, bro, it just... I don't know. [sighs] Bro, free school better than no school. I already told you that yesterday, though. [Ollie] It is what it is. Just to have it in your back pocket. Just in case everything don't work out, bro. [Ollie] Yeah. [John] If you get that deal, you fixin' to go to the league, bro. [indistinct chatter] [intercom beeps] [John's mom on PA] Hello, teachers. We are getting ready to do the sign-in of John Franklin III {\an8}to Auburn University in the conference room at this time. If you would like to be a part of history... -How are you, sweetie? Congratulations. -I'm all right. [woman] Let's go ahead and take that pen. Let's make it official. Congratulations. And with that, it's official. You're going to Auburn. [cheering] Thanks for supporting me from my journey from South, you know, to Florida State, and now to Auburn. Uh, it's been a long one, but I feel like it's gonna be worth it in the long run. Thank you for all y'all done for me. Appreciate it. -[woman] Thank you. -[cheering] [John] Yeah, unfortunately, you know, the brawl that happened in the Mississippi Delta game messed up a lot of people recruiting. But, um, you know, everything happens for a reason. At the time, I needed to show what I had to the right people, you know what I'm saying? And, uh, I mean, I don't know how it happened, but, you know, there's a man upstairs that just made it happen that way. And it was just one of those games where, you know, as a athlete, you dream of the perfect game, and it was... that was the perfect game for me. [John's mom] So glad you guys made it. Wait. He's gonna sign cups. He's gonna sign the Auburn cups. -Thank you, sir. Appreciate that. -Anything for you. [man] John, you gotta get used to it. This is how it's gonna be after your NFL games. [all laughing] [gunshot] [Wyatt] He running. Still running. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That's it. Glad I ain't got a hearing final next week... 'cause I'm sure gonna be deaf. Gonna hopefully get some offers. Talk to some schools. It's a huge decision to make at just 20 years old, so you gotta think about it, pray about it, and make a decision that you feel comfortable with. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I'll have the opportunity to go play somewhere, you know, uh, I don't know what level or what league. But, uh, if not, you know, if I decide not to play and go to Mississippi State, I guess I'd just be a average Joe, and just go to school and start working. [chuckles] He's funny because, like, he'll start... Every conversation we've had, he'll start it with, "I'm fine, I'm fine, like, you know, I'm just gonna go to Mississippi State and be a regular student, like, I'm cool. It's all good." But then, he came in here one day and I said to him, "Well, Wyatt, you do have some offers. Mississippi College, which is a great academic school. And you still get to play, maybe not at the level that you want to, but you still get to play, versus just giving it up." And he slammed the door and he said... "No." He said, "I backed up Chad Kelly last year, all year, and he's freaking playing for Ole Miss and leading the SEC. This year, I started over a Florida State transfer, and now he's going to Auburn. I ain't going to doggone Mississippi College." And I just was like, "Okay. You know, point... point made." [Todd Cooley on speaker] What's up, brother? I'm doing good. [stammers] I'm... Heard about y'all getting kicked out of the playoffs. {\an8}I'd like to make a trip to the Delta with a baseball bat, {\an8}but other than that, I'm good. {\an8}Yep. Well, you know why we called time-out right before the half? Why's that? The Auburn coach, Rhett Lashlee, was there. Mmm-hmm, I was sitting by him. All right. Well, guess... We wanted him to see him for another series. Guess what, they offered him. Hey, Buddy, what about number 90? He's gonna go somewhere, but I just don't know where. He's, uh, yeah, he's a really good football player. Yeah. 'Cause he's not gonna have a 2,5, is he? [sing-song] I don't think so. [Wagner] You need to do the annotated bib. Because if you make a "D" in there, you gotta make a "B" in there in order to have the 2,5. All right. I'm gonna do it. [Wagner] I replaced the "F" with a "D", worst case. And when I plug all that in, I have him at a 2,52. {\an8}Kid-wise... I mean, I know about the playing-wise, what does that mean? {\an8}You know, I-- {\an8}I love him. He's got trust issues, obviously. -[Boone] I know. -But once he trusts you... [Boone] Yeah. -I mean, good as... You're in. -Okay. -You've been right for me for four times. -[Wagner chuckles] Let's make it a fifth one. -All right. -Okay. This'd be number five you'd been right for me. -[chuckles] -So, I'm counting on you. -All right. Well, I'm right again, so... -[chuckling] I got a little text message this morning that you had called... Who? You called SEMO back and told them... Ah, he had called me. Well, he told me that you had talked to him and that you wanted to visit. -So? -So, you're gonna go Friday? Yeah. I just wanted to take the trip, I guess. Are you gonna fly? Yeah. I'll have my headphones there. Just chilling. Now, if something happen to me, now, it is your fault. I'm gonna blame it on you. Something-- Nothing's gonna happen to you. [announcer] It's the National Championship game. Do they not do it right in Biloxi? And Alex Norwood catches the last touchdown of the game. Chism to Norwood, makes the catch. Northwest Mississippi Community College, 2015 National champs. [cheering] [James] And now it is under way. Ezekiel Rose, back for the kick. [Ezekiel] Whoo! Ooh! Ooh! [James] Oh, he has a nice spin. -[grunting] -He get hits out of bound. [James howls] And he's in! He's in for... Oh, yeah! -[James laughing] -[Ezekiel] Yeah! [man] Hey, so I hear both y'all are from East Mississippi. How do y'all feel about Northwest winning the National Championship? Ah, man. Hey, look, we know who the real champions are around here in JUCO, man. Every dog has their day, man. Yeah, every dog has their day. Messed up how they did 'em down there, but you know, I know them boys gonna bounce back, man. They got a good program, and they always will have one. So, you know, there's just no knowing what's gonna happen next year. They came up here, they beat them boys 66 to 13. Didn't we beat 'em, like, 30 points? -I think 48 to what? Twelve? -Yeah, 16 or somethin'. {\an8}[Buddy] Uh, I think we would have been probably... ranked number one or number two going into the playoffs. And I've said all along, whoever wins this year, put an asterisk beside it, because they know we weren't in it. And when it comes down to it, they know. They know. They may tell their players different, they may tell their fans different, they may go home and tell their wives different, but they know. [DJ] After everything that happened, I felt like most of it was my fault. I put most of the blame on myself. I felt like it could have been avoided. Most of my teammates tell me not to blame myself, 'cause it could have happened to anybody, you know, but... everything happens for a reason. And now, it's just... Okay, now, I gotta work, going to tutoring and all that. Got about three classes I have to pass. If I can't do that, you can't play no more. [typing] [Wagner] Whoa, that makes a big difference. Whoo! All right, I can deal with that. -I can deal with that. -[chuckling] That makes me feel better. I was freaking out a little bit. This morning, at 8:30, he walked in here. Never seen him on his own like that. I was shocked. He had like 18 quizzes to make up. And he sat down, and he was in here for two or so hours. -[recruiter] Mmm-hmm. -And he took all the quizzes. He made up a test. So I think he's starting to kind of figure it out at this point. -Well, good. -I just hope he's not too late. In my experiences with players like this, usually when December rolls around, and all their buddies sign, usually shit gets real. [DJ] A change... a change just came over me. I'm just worried about keeping my grades up. And I used to think that school is hard, hard, hard, man. Like, I'd never be able to do this. If you put your mind to it, man, you can do anything you wanna do. You put your mind to anything, you can do anything you wanna do. Anything. [indistinct chatter] -[player] Put your helmet on. -Are y'all ready? [John] I'm ready. I'm about to flunk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Wagner] My heart will break for Ronald Ollie if he doesn't have that 2,5 GPA, and he's not eligible for D-I. Because I have no idea what that kid will do. Like, there is no plan B. [indistinct chatter] [Wagner] But it's good. [Ollie sighs] Whoo! That's what my average is? [chuckles] Oh, man! -[Wagner] What's his average? -Eighty-nine. [laughs] -[Wagner] Are you gonna round it up? -I always do. [squeals and laughs] You made an "A"! [laughs] You made an "A", Ollie! Oh, man, that's crazy. -You did it. -Yeah. You did it. How many hours did you spend in that office? -Uh, too many? -Uh... too many. [chuckles] [teacher] You know you got family here, all right? -Yes, ma'am. -Always. Okay? -Yes, ma'am. -All right. I won't be back. I made an "A". -You made an "A!" -I made an "A." [both laughing] I made an "A" in Comp II. I made an "A." Stop, before my back goes out. You're gonna make my back go out. You made an "A," Ollie. Oh! Oh! Oh, I don't ever wanna hear you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever say -you can't do anything, you hear me? -Yes, ma'am. -Never say that. -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you. Thank you so much. -Thank you! [Ollie] Ah, I made an "A." -Love ya! -Yeah, love you, too. Man. [sighs] [Wagner] Good morning. [player] Good morning. [rapping] Jay, that's right, bro. Fuckin' last day. [both grunting] All right! Oh, shit, uh, my back! [Wagner] Why are you walking around with toilet paper in your hand? -Because I am the shit. -[Wyatt] He is. [Wagner] So, you carry toilet paper because you are the shit? [laughs] [stammers] Yeah! [grunts and sniffs] You liked that, didn't you? You liked that. Wyatt, last day, baby! [chuckling] -[Ollie grunts] -[Wyatt] What's up, Ollie? -[Ollie] Hey, man... [laughs] -[gasps] [player] God! [Wagner] Aw... -[Wyatt] What was that? -[player groans] [John] I feel like... we've been locked up at Scooba for two years. I've been in Scooba for two years. [laughing] [player] What you gonna do, bro? -I'm gonna kill somebody! -[all laughing] [Ollie] We gotta take a selfie with Miss Wagner. [Wagner] Are you ready to take yours? [Ollie] Hell no! -[all laughing] -[Wagner] Huh? I'm gonna get mine later on when I'm getting ready to go. -Let's just take it right now. -Uh-uh, because... I'll be crying then and I'll look a hot mess. -So, just do it now. -No, you ain't gonna cry. Hold on. Hold on. [sighs] One, two, three. I gotta drop the ball today, to all these schools. [Wagner] What are you gonna do? -You've already made your decision? -Yep. -Where are you going? -Retiring. -Mississippi State? -Yep. -Regular student. -Yep. -Walking on? -No. What? Ain't no way you fixin' to just stop. -Got to. -Why? 'Cause ain't even... They still won't even talk to me about walking on. [stammering] Like, I'm not gonna go up there and just kiss their butt. -Can't do it. Won't do it. -[Wagner] Go to Mississippi College. Yeah, why you gonna quit playin' ball, bro? [Ollie] Go play D-II ball! [Wagner] Don't be prideful and miss out on a free education and a great opportunity just 'cause your ego hurts. -Nah. -[Wagner] Come on, now. Man don't wanna play D-II ball. I don't wanna play D-II. [Wagner] Well, it's better than nothing. How many SEC signings did we get? Two? -[Wagner] None? One. -One? -[Wagner] Who's the second? -I thought DJ Law would be the second. [Wagner] He ain't graduating. What are you talking about? -Oh, yeah. -Nobody's signing him till he graduates. Well, I can be in the woods by 3:00, so we got to... get this show on the road. -[player] And you cry every year? -Mmm-hmm. See, I couldn't handle your job. 'Cause I get connected with people. [Wagner] Twice a year, I cry. 'Cause I cry in December when... and then I have to cry again in May. -'Cause I get all attached. -I get attached, too. Exactly. -[Ollie mock cries] -It's like losing children. I need you to be good over the break. And when you come back in January... -we're getting real. -All right. We're not... missing class, we're not leaving in the middle. We're getting this done, and we're getting you somewhere else. -I just did, like, eight quizzes. -Deal? [laughter] -Go! -[both grunting] [John] Sign me off. Oh, I can't do both of y'all -at the same time! -[Wyatt] Back-to-back. It's about that time. [Wagner] Aw... -Give me my slip, Warden. -[chuckles] I was born for this moment. Whoo! Sender... recipient. Please say I graduated. [Wagner] Do good things, okay? I will. It ain't like I'm going across the country, -I'm three hours away. -It ain't like we're getting deported. I know. I'm gonna miss you. -I got FaceTime. -I'm gonna be, like, 20 minutes from here. -Work hard. -Always. Time to get to this money, now. Work hard, play harder. [chuckles] In that order. -In that order. -Not necessarily. Yeah, in that order. -I'm gone. -All right. -Bye, Wyatt. -I'll see you. Tight, tight schedule to get out of here. Ten-four. And watch. Watch this, as I leave. Be safe, please. Yeah, you know. I'm always good. [smacks lips] You better not cry, come on. Stand up. Give me my hug. And, uh... Come on, come on. Come on. [groans] -Thank you. -Thank you. [Ollie] Thank you so much. You hear me? Thank you. Oh. [Wagner] You're smart. You know that? -[Ollie] Yeah. -You're a smart kid. [Ollie chuckles] And I want you to do great things. Okay? -Yes, ma'am. -I expect that from you. [Ollie] All right. Ain't gonna let you down. [Wagner] Okay. [Ollie] You hear me? [grunts and chuckles] -[Wagner] I love you. -I love you, too. Is it three o'clock yet? My ride probably over there. I'mma call you. -I'mma call you this weekend. -Okay. Bam! -I won't fuck with you, bro. -Oh, really? Well... I ain't out of here till Friday! [Ollie chuckles] -[player] Where you at? -[sniffling] [player] It's gonna be all right. Hey, had fun playing with ya, boy. -Oh, you ain't gonna tell yet? -I'm gonna tell everybody. -Can I come with you? -Yeah. I was waiting on you, but you didn't, so we-- [inaudible] [Buddy] The big thing in recruiting... is trying to see through some of the bull. People wanna be in your life for one of two reasons. They either love you or they want something from you. {\an8}I watched you, and then I heard your story. And I said, "Guys, this guy... this kid is looking for a family. He's looking for a family to be a part of." We hope that you guys, uh, join the family. That's, that's big for us. Uh, as a parent, you know, I have three daughters. I remember I told you that. That's my three daughters. Rebecca, Julianna, Lauren. She goes to Mississippi State. This is not about me. It's not about East Mississippi. It's about you and this family. And this is not about me. This is about you. You have so many people that throw rocks and stones. You know, people are always looking to knock us off. They don't know us. They just know we win. And we beat people to sleep. I mean, we really do. It's not about the football. It's about the academics. It's about him getting a degree. I'm not even worried about football. I'm worried about getting that degree. You may not think it's a very big decision, but the decision that you make is gonna directly affect where you go to college, what kind of job you get... Is this it? Is this it? Now, here's the thing, now. I want this to be it. If it's not it, I wanna know. This is how I feed my family now. Okay? And this is something that I take very, very seriously. Are you sure?
