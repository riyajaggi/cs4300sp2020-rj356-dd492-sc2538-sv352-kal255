 about 20 times over the game, bro. -[mumbles] -He was swinging them bitches, bro. Soon as we score, he'll run and pick them up, put them back on the head, bro. Get so happy. Soon as the defense get on the field, he mad, boy. Yeah, he be like... [breathes heavily and grunts] [imitates Buddy] I oughta beat your damn ass right about now. [all chuckle] [in normal voice] Hey, Coach Stephens is like that dude on Sling Blade. [imitates Buddy] I get so damn mad, I can't turn back! [all laugh] [Buddy] I just get so tired, you know. Yeah, I get so tired with football. You get tired of just beating the same thing all over and over,

 and you get tired of, um... I get tired of being nice. I get tired of being mean. I get tired of being happy. I get tired of being sad. I just get tired. You know, you get tired of the cameras. You get tired of the microphones. You know, because I start losing my mind, and every guy with a camera starts finding me. And hanging out... [mutters] I can hear you now in that little speaker. [imitating cameraman] Get on Buddy. I think he's fixing to lose it. It's into the boiling point. Here, he's fixing to blow. He's fixing to blow! He's fixing to blow! [marching band playing] [engine whirring] [Ed Holly] Let's go! Big week! Saturday, two o'clock. Big game! -[Williams] Go! -[Ed Holly] Work! God gave us a great day to work. {\an8}We know you gonna play hard. {\an8}But can you make the play? That's the question. Can you do your job? Go to the line, Snoop! Just go to the line! Hey, we know what we're doing, it's always to our sideline! You don't have to ask! Hurry up, start walking! Let's go, hurry up! Hurry up, Kam! Let's go, son, you up! That was a frustrating game to coach in. {\an8}All of us defensively, man, just wondering {\an8}what can we do to be able to stop people when we need to stop people. Y'all need to be hustling to the ball, hustling back to the ball. You understand? We ain't stopping running today. If you take care of me, guys, I will take care of you. You understand? You know, we as a defensive staff, you know, we take pride in what we do. We never wanna give up 49 points to anybody. Wait, wait. You quit making their ass look silly as shit and find something that fucking works. -It's punt safe! -[Williams] Get down, go! [Buddy] Get down and go, get down and go! Go, go, go! -[indistinct chattering] -[Williams] Cover, cover, cover! [Ed Holly] Watch the back side! -That's all we play! -[whistle blows] Give 'em a fucking touchdown! -[player] He said, "fuck." -[Chauncey] What? [Snoop] He said the f-word. [Rodney] That's the first time I heard him swear. -[Snoop] I didn't know he could. -I don't hear him cussing. [Tim] I never heard Coach Holly use the f-word. [player] I ain't never heard his ass cuss. [Tim] Let's go sack these bitches. {\an8}[Williams] Work your move, Tim. Work your move, Tim. {\an8}-Get good at it. -[coach] Go, go, go! [player grunts] [Williams] Hey, Tim! Tim! Where your move at, son? Where your move at? [Wagner] I have not seen our defense play like that since 2009. So I'm not sure what's going on. This group is just different for some reason. There's just a lot of... A lot more problems, I feel like... on this team, and not academic problems. Just, like, mental problems. I mean, emotional, mental issues. It's a Monday, that's what it is. [Rodney] No, it's your attitude, bro. You gotta shake back, ya heard me. -You gotta shake back. -[groans] [Rodney] It's all in the mind. That's that Penn State state of mind. {\an8}[Kam] Give me a reason, and I'll fight the fuck out you. [Rodney] You gotta go out your way to get beat up by me. Ya heard me? Yeah, you gotta go out your way. Yo, ain't no running around here. No running around here. Really, you pussy. Pussy. But everybody's a gangster in pads, though. That what I be saying. [Wagner] Every year, up until this point, there is like a brotherhood almost. And I'm not really getting that with this team, especially the D-line. I feel like there's a lot of stuff going on within the D-line. And maybe that's where the breakdown is on the field. I don't know, but not good. And if we don't play better this week on defense, we will not beat Northwest. [Stringer] In measure three... {\an8}[in sing-song] One, two, three, ta, dotted half note. {\an8}Quarter, dotted half note. Quarter, whole, two, three and off. Very simple. Can I hear it, please? One, two, ready, and... [band playing Awolnation's "Sail"] [inaudible] [radio host] A game of enormous implications Saturday afternoon, {\an8}as number one travels to number four in Scooba to face East Mississippi. What a great beacon for the league to have number one and number four this late in the year going at it for a national championship, wouldn't you agree? {\an8}The biggest game we'll play all year. [chuckles] {\an8}Just gonna do a lot of determining. Just like... "Hey, buddy, we're still number one." [chuckles] [band continues playing] [Stringer] We've gotta beat Northwest. {\an8}If we don't do that, forget it. {\an8}I think we'll beat this number one team. {\an8}We should be number one after that. {\an8}If you can beat number one, and you're number four, {\an8}then you're gonna get to play for a national championship. [Rodney] Y'all saying we got a shot to make the championship? Yeah, we do. Not the state, I'm talking about the national. We gotta win the fuck out, son. [band continues playing] I don't know. I mean, I think they're pretty good. It's a good team. I wish our defense was a bit stronger. But it's a good team. [Williams] This ain't no ordinary week. This is a big-time game. And the weakness that they have is their offensive line. {\an8}-Do you understand? -[player] Mm-hmm. {\an8}With the talent that we got in this room, okay... I'm raising the expectation bar high. You gotta step up. You gonna step up. It's gonna be up to you to step up to the challenge. I can sit up here and drill you all day, guys. But sacks, it's nothing but an effort play. It ain't what you doing, it ain't what move you working, it's an effort play. Very first play of the game. Just get off. Hey, Tim Bonner, you mean to tell me that guy quicker than you? Son, I am challenging you. I am challenging you, Tim. You got the quickest get off in here out of everybody in this room. -Of course. -[player chuckles] [Williams] You mean to tell me you can't do this? I believe you can, over and over and over and over. But it ain't about me believing it, son. It's about you. It's about you believing that you can do it. [Johnson] Your nickname should be "Can't Get It Right." [Tim] That's what they used to call me at Louisville when I had to play linebacker during the damn linebacker drill. [Johnson] "Can't Get It Right"? Yeah, Jay bird, he had named me "Can't Get It Right." -'Cause you can't do it right. -Can't do nothing in the drill right. [Tim] I need to get way more better than I'm doing now 'cause I ain't got no sacks. I need to get some sacks. {\an8}'Cause I'm labeled as a speed rusher to the D-I coaches. {\an8}Like, they won't... They like to see me sack the quarterbacks. {\an8}So that what they recruited me for, to rush the quarterback. [Johnson] Kam, 5:30. [claps] You ready? Kam ain't on... Oh, that is Kam. Damn, I didn't know you was on here. [Johnson] Yeah, me and Kam got us a date with class. I might even come in there and sit beside you, Kam. [Tim] I graduate in May. Since football gonna be over with, I wanna be mostly focused on my grades. Since I'm having free time, I'mma do a lot of studying. If I wasn't playing football, I don't know what I'd be doing. I don't know where I'd be at right now. But playing football got me in school. And so that's how that happened. [Willie] You know, Tim always said... He never talk about working anywhere. {\an8}Tim only talked about  playing pro football. {\an8}You know, that was what he did, that's what he talked about. [man] That's his dream, to make it to the NFL. [Willie] That's all he talk about. You know what Tim told me when he get to the NFL? He gonna buy a double-wide trailer and an old-school Cutlass. -[both laugh] -[Willie] I said, "You can do better." [laughing] [man] Hey-- [Willie laughs] An old-school car with no rims on it. [man] Oh, yeah. An old car. [Jesse] It would mean a lot. He'll be the first {\an8}to even have any of this to happen, you know, so... {\an8}He did enough already, if you ask me. Man, I tell you, Tim been an inspiration to a lot of people, man. -[Jesse] He is. -[man] Everybody loves him. [Willie] He's an inspiration to a lot of people. I sure hope he pulls this thing off 'cause... he deserve it, man. He done put a lot in it, man. [Willie] Yes, sir. A lot of years. {\an8}[Jesse] Playin' football for a long time, man. {\an8}[Tim Causey] God put Tim on this planet to play football. {\an8}And when he's not doing that, he's bored stiff. [chuckles] {\an8}Just a teenage boy with a lot of energy, man. {\an8}What a great game to be a part of if you got energy and you that size. {\an8}-[both chuckle] -And love contact. [Pitts] He was aggressive, he was violent and he made you pay. [Causey] I felt sorry for the quarterback 'cause he couldn't get away. [Pitts] You could really let him cut his motor loose. -And we were gonna get a sack. -He had a ton that year, too. Five, six times a game. -He had a ton of sacks that year. -Yeah. [man] I got a chance  to coach against him at Wilcox. Everything I was gearin' was trying to get away from him. Run away from him. Run away from him. And it still didn't work. [Jesse] Yeah, 'cause he don't use his hand. -It's raw talent! -[Jesse] He don't use his hands. I'm telling you, when he comes off the line, he has nothing but speed and power, 'cause he ain't got no moves right now. -[Jesse] He ain't use his hands. -He ain't got no moves. He's just coming off the line, wanting the ball. [Willie] I know Tim wanna be a baller, but he gotta get his technique down first, you know. You just can't go after the quarterback, it's a technique you gotta have. And he said it was just hard for him to get to that mode. But only somebody can really stop Tim from what he doing now is Tim. [Williams] Tim, you know, he got into a situation really early at Louisville so he had very minimum time on the field. So the things that he would be going through as a redshirt freshman at four-year school, he's going through now. You know, you fail, you fail, you fail. You know, you get down a little bit, you know. He never gotten over that hump of failing and being conquered. And I think the lack of confidence has kind of hindered him from listening and trying. If we have his skill set on Saturday, and he's playing at 100%, we won't have any problems stopping the pass. That's how much I believe in this young man. [Williams] Uh, see this? This is the reason why we're rolling. 'Cause I'm sick of it. Now you see it. We go through  walk throughs and we get it and we get out of here, it's just like we lose our freaking mind. This happen in the game, you know what I mean, somebody gonna be in trouble. It's probably gonna be me. And me. [chuckles] Oh, come on, that's funny. [chuckles] I mean, I don't think... Nah, it ain't funny, man. When you rep something with these guys and they don't get it. [Ed Holly] Yeah, I got you. All right, you see Tim come down? They're gonna pick up that blitz. [stammers] It's the looper right here, and that's Snoop... -Ah, come on, Snoop. -You know, he's just... Everything with him is five minutes behind. [Ed Holly] He's just a baby. [coach] Get your eyes up, Snoop. Play the guard. Press, Snoop. Get in there, Snoop! Rip in there, Snoop! -Snoop, you gotta get out your stance! -[whistle blowing] -Snoop, get out your stance! -[Rodney] Sink back, Snoop. You act like you don't know the play. Tell 'em. Go on, tell the world. {\an8}-Tell 'em. -I forgot the play. {\an8}Yeah. And we just went over 'em. {\an8}We just went over the plays and I forgot. My bad. [Williams] Snoop is still behind the eight ball, especially now that we are in the season, we have to focus on those guys who are ahead of 'em. We've been in the sideline watching Snoop the whole time, bro. They be tearin' his ass up, bro. [chuckles] [Maleke] If you don't straighten up, your ass ain't going nowhere next year {\an8}or the year after that, but back to Canton. {\an8}[player] Nah, your ass got till the spring to straighten up. {\an8}Hell yeah, that what I told you the other day. But it ain't enough for you to sit there 'cause they can get a motherfucker out of high school for that. This is like legit college, bro. You gotta go out and play  or get your ass killed. [Chauncey] It's not that  you undisciplined, you just don't know what the fuck to do. Hey, I didn't know what the fuck to do at high school. That when they told me, "Go out there, make plays." All right, that's what done. That's what I'm saying. You sit, watch film, and they teach you. Why the fuck you still don't do the shit? You scared you gonna hurt somebody? [Maleke] Probably what it is, huh? We just need to, before every game, punch the fuck out of Snoop. Now, at my high school, we had a nigga just like you. Soft as fuck, but you was strong, bro. Every practice, my coaches be like, "Try to hit this nigga in the mouth." Snoop be out there fumblin'-bumblin'. -[Maleke] And strong as fuck. -[Chauncey] Strong as a motherfucker. -[Tim chuckles] Strong as fuck. -[Chauncey] Soft as shit. [Maleke] He big country strong too, bro. I told you, Snoop just... His body grew too big for his mind. -[all laughing] -Snoop be like... -"The fuck going on?" -[all laughing] [Glenda] Maleke was talking about you earlier. -What he say? -Said all you do is smile and laugh. {\an8}Somebody can talk about you, joke, and you're not gonna do a thing but laugh. {\an8}That laugh right there, then smile, that's all you gonna do. Me and my dad just got into a fight, like, two months ago. That was one moment you really didn't want to talk to me. To this day, like... If I see my dad, now, I'll... I'll put him in his place, for real. It wouldn't be the first time I did. Ain't gotta put a grown man in his place. He already in his place. No, not really. No, I'mma put him in his place, um, how he should show more respect to his son. So he didn't come see you in any of your games or anything? Oh, no. Even my... This man... -He missed your graduation and everything? -He missed everything. He came to my brother graduation, but he ain't come to mine. He came to my... He came to my sister graduation, they graduated the year before me. Didn't come to mine. He went to all their graduations. Didn't come to mine. [woman speaking indistinctly] [Kam chuckles] Hey, Tim. -Remember you was scared of me, bro? -[Tim] Hmm? [Kam] This man used to be scared of me. All right. Hold on. No, no, no, I wasn't scared, no. When this big, dumb motherfucker first came here, I saw that nigga, I said, "There's a big mofo, I ain't gonna fuck with him for real like that." When I heard him talk, "Oh, that bitch retarded." -I started fighting his ass... -[all laugh] [chuckles] When I heard that motherfucker talk, it was over with. [student] What made you come down here? 'Cause I got in trouble. [Tim] If anybody from a university got in trouble... I'm trying to go close to my mom. My mom never seen me play football. -[Tim] Where your mama stay at? Georgia? -Mm-hmm. Not one day, bro. Never seen me play. [Tim] For real? Only if you knew Kam's real background... [Kam] Hey, chill the fuck out, dude. I ain't finna say nothing. That's why I said, "Only if you knew." I ain't finna say nothing. [Kam] Chill the fuck out, nigga. -What's wrong with him? -[student] I don't know. [Kam] I'm going UGA, nigga. So I can go home, nigga. I'm talking close to home. [student talking indistinctly] [student] Pull your pants up, Kam! [Latoya] We were young teenagers, 14 and 15. I was petrified. {\an8}I did not know about pregnancy and stuff like that, you know. {\an8}And I was hiding it, of course. I didn't want my mom to find out or my uncles or my family members. So, for a long time I hid it. Until it was just no more hiding. [chuckles] It's like, this is what's going on. I ended up having a cesarean section, thank God. Because he was... He was almost 12 pounds. He was 11 pounds, eight ounces and long. He was huge. When he came along, I fell in love. I didn't know what love was until I seen him. {\an8}-[Kam] Damn! -[man] That's not your ball. {\an8}[Kam] I hit the... No, I meant to hit this one. [man chuckles] Come on, man. Why the fuck it ain't hit the ball how I wanted it to? [man] I won. You lost. -That's a fact. Thank you, thank you. -[Kam] Bro. Hey! I was punishing him, Dad. Hey, he probably had, like, five balls on the table. I had two. [man] That shot yesterday was looking off, so no, no, no. Bro, I was tired yesterday. {\an8}Your excuses are tools of the incompetent. They build monuments of nothing. {\an8}Those who specialize in their use {\an8}are seldom capable of accomplishing anything... -[woman] Here we go. -...sir. -[laughs] -All right? Make your excuses, and you know you should know they're excuses, and you should know the definition of an excuse. Or is it a reason? What is it? -It's a reason. -It's your reason, but it's an excuse. -[Kam chuckles] -[woman] All right. -You can make your own plate. -[oven beeping] [Kam] Can you make me one, Ma? Hey, bro. Don't take all the eggs, bro. Damn! [man] That right there, buddy, damn, bro! -[Kam] You didn't put cheese. -[woman] There's not much. -[woman] I did. -[Kam] Barely. [Latoya] My uncle, he stepped up and he asked me, you know, "Why don't I help you?" And to help in this young man's life because my uncle, he was into the school board and he was into sports, and he was into so much and he didn't have children of his own. So I made the decision to, you know, for him to go with my uncle, but it was the hardest decision ever. [Aaron] We just had to make the decision, pray on it, feel good about it and... {\an8}First, I think it's a blessing to have that relationship {\an8}with a father-son, you know. And me being in position to coach him, being a motivator, being a father figure, I think that had a lot to do with it. I feel like I know him well, sometimes better than he knows himself. But, you know... I know he's a type of young man that... that really responds well to positive energy. He has someone to give him a foundation, which I did not have. [Kam] He was the number one player, in the state or something like that. Like, he... I didn't even know. [Aaron] You got tired of hearing it. "Your dad this, your dad..." It doesn't matter. It's not my turn. I had my day, you know, and I want your day to go further. What parent doesn't, you know? They want the best for their child. I want you to eat better than I eat, you know. I didn't grow up in this house, -you know, you did. -[Kam] Mm-hmm. Now, have your family grow up in a better house. That's what it's all about. That's just the American dream, I guess, you know? [Kam] Yeah... So we just do what we do. Keep pushing forward. [Latoya] When he would go back from the weekends with me, it would be so hard to get him back on track because he wanted to be back with me, you know, and his siblings. My uncle was like, "You know, well, maybe we should put a little distance so that he'll just stay focused." So I moved to Georgia, and he was so young, he didn't really understand, you know. It was for the best. Or none of us, really... [voice breaking] Excuse me. [stammering] I didn't know, you know, what to do. I just wanted to help him, you know, and I didn't know how to start. I didn't know how to start to... The process in helping my son because I didn't understand. I was very... I was a child. It was the hardest decision I've ever made, to leave my baby up there. But I knew he was in good hands and he was around my family and I just knew that my uncle had the means to help out financially and mentally because I didn't know, you know. I didn't know what was going on at all. You know, when you go off to college, some people are like, "Yay, I'm free!" He was more like... "I'm alone. I've been dropped off again." Going through depression, and his mind's wondering, he's already been through so much. He tried to self-medicate, smoking weed, and I think that he felt as if, "Well, I'm not gonna take these pills," because he doesn't like the sedated feeling. You know, to walk around feeling like a zombie, trapped inside of yourself. [chuckles softly] That's not good sometimes. When everything happened, he got kicked out of school. He waited till the last minute to let me know. 'Cause for so long, I've been out of the loop. But the one thing that he could say is, "Mom, guess what? I'm coming to the South. I'm gonna be closer to you." So, he's always had to drive to get to his mom. [sniffles] Always. Our greatest sacrifice was separation, you know. And it's like, "Son, make it worth it. Continue to work hard so that we could say we did this thing together. We're gonna make this... We're gonna make this time apart matter. At all costs. This is not gonna be for nothing." [indistinct chatter] [Buddy] Sit inside. Hand set. Move, move! Move, move! -Move! That's terrible. Terrible. -Hey! Hey! Kam. You hopping and coming off the damn ball. Go full speed! [Buddy] Kam. Kam. One time. You're as big as anybody out here. You're bigger than anybody out here. You're probably the biggest. One time, I'd like for you... Just to see you take a guy and reset his ass back here. You know, just one time. I mean, not bull rush, but just reset his ass back here and come off full speed. Let's go! You're too dadgum big and good  to be wasting your talent. Get down! Kam is a puzzle. But the one thing about him is, if Kam thinks you care about him and knows you care about him, he'll bend over backwards for you. But you have to stay on him, you know. He's been going in so many different directions. You know, he's been sent in so many different directions. Kam is, uh... Kam's a good kid. That's CJ's project child. {\an8}Kam, get off the rock. Be relentless. Be relentless. {\an8}[player] Set, hit! -[Johnson] Run! Yes, run! Run! -[whistle blows] -Yes! Yes! -[Williams] That's how you penetrate, Kam. That's how you penetrate! Now, finish! Run through the line and finish! Do that every damn play! -[Kam] That jumping shit worked. -[Johnson] I told you. What'd you think, I'm gonna come out here -and talk for no reason? -[Kam chuckles] I don't just talk for no reason, man. Hey, jog off like champions, man. Jog off like champions. [Chauncey] I always worry about Kam. Kam makes bad decisions. Sometimes when Kam gets mad, sometimes he wants to go back home. Sometimes he don't wanna be here no more. And I'll be like, "Kam, this your one opportunity. You gotta... Either you gonna make something out of it, or it's gonna break you. It's not the fact that the coaches are getting on you 'cause you do some of the stuff you do, but it's the fact that they care. They want you to make something out of our life. You gonna be good. If I can do it and some of the other out-of-states can do it, then you can do it. Like, we all here trying to do the same thing and we're all here for the same reason. Like, bro, just believe in the system. The system works. Just believe in it." That's like D-I, when NCAA come drug test you. They'll drug test for weed. And now your university is supposed to test up to three... Up to once every three months. Supposed to have a team test every three months. They could have random whenever. But you've been there, you know. You can't play with them folks, they control your life. No, it's not that they control your life, it's just like anything else. You can't... There's certain things you just can't do with the job or the career that you're trying to pursue. Because you're different. You feel like you got to do drugs and you don't want to be drug tested, then guess what? -Don't play football. -Yeah. It's just that simple. -[player] Real simple, ain't it? -Oh, yeah. -When you think about it. -People make it hard, but it ain't. -It's real simple. It's real simple. -Real simple. [man in video] Defensive lineman Chauncey Rivers arrested for marijuana. {\an8}Typically that's not a huge deal. {\an8}I mean, a large percentage of college students, uh, you know, smoke a little bit of the sticky icky. Uh, you know, so is the guy a serial killer? No! [stammers] But three times in seven months this guy's been busted for weed! Uh, hello, Chauncey! [yelling] What are you doing? [Wagner] You knew you could lose every... -[Chauncey] I know. -[Wagner] You knew, like, "If I fail one more drug test, I'm done." -I know. -[Wagner] And you did it anyway. So, like, I would say, "Okay, that means you have a problem." That's what my mama said. But you went through the treatment and you still don't think you have a problem. I don't picture myself a drug addict, 'cause I can sit there and not smoke weed. But it's like, "Man, let me just hit this one blunt." Then one turned into two. Bad decision after bad decision. -[Wagner] And were you doing it every day? -[Chauncey] Yeah. [Wagner] Didn't you get caught in your car or something? Yeah. [Wagner] What happened? It was just... [chuckles] -[Wagner] You passed out in your car? -No. You know, I just happened to, like, doze off for a quick... [chuckles] I don't know how. Well, I was just... -You know? -You just took a nap. -And then they arrest you? -Yeah. How long were you in jail? My first two times, it was a misdemeanor. So, I'm like, "I'm getting out that night." I'd been in the waiting cell for, like, five hours. They called my name and they're like, "Chauncey, you need to sign your paperwork." So I'm like, "Hold on, I'm staying the night?" She's like, "Oh, yeah. You actually finna, uh... We finna book you in." I was like, "I can't go up there, bro." I ain't gonna lie to you, like, I was scared. I've been in the holding cell before, but I ain't been booked in, like, changed clothes and everything. I would've been so depressed, I ain't gonna lie. [Chauncey] So I call my mama... [chuckles] So I was like, "Mama, they say they're finna book me in." She's like... She's like, "You gotta be strong." Man, I swear to God, I broke down crying on that phone. I said, "They putting you on the floor with real criminals." Like, murderers and stuff. I said I had a misdemeanor for some marijuana, but I can't be in a jail with a dude who killed somebody. I mean, that night was just like... I couldn't sleep. So I finally get out, I said to my mom... "Mama, that's it." I started crying so bad, bro. Man, you know, folks say you can lose it all and you could lose it all so fast. I literally seen my future walk away in six months. I can't be one of them boys, like, you know, who threw everything away. [Wagner] How do you handle the stress? Ma Dukes, she call me. And we just sit on the phone and talk. She understands what I'm going through. We see eye to eye. [Ezekiel] It's a mama thing. Ma Dukes be like... She's like the best friend. She keep it real with me. [Devaunya Rivers] Chauncey's a suburb kid. And everything came to Chauncey easy. Got his own car for Christmas. {\an8}I was PTA, uh... booster club, selling stuff, making stuff for the team. The all-American family. Never had any stress. I never realized the pressures that he was under, of him feeling that he had to be great. Somewhere along the way, football became his job, his out, because he felt he had to make it for us. It put him in a position to make a bad decision. [woman] What your mama was saying? She piped up. You know how she be in the stands. She be piped up. You can hear her? I can always hear my mama. My mama ain't never missed a game my whole career. I'm finna call you right back.

[stammers] It ain't even, like, not making it for your dad. It's like... Ma Dukes put a lot of work in. I'm the last child. I'm the child she put everything into. So my mom was like, "If you don't believe in yourself, I'mma believe in you ten times more than you believe in yourself." Know what I'm saying? I just went to jail three times in one year. Like, who wants a kid who went to jail three times in one year? And she's like, "Chauncey... you can do this." ♪ For my momma ♪ ♪ For my momma Yeah ♪ ♪ I'm trying to make it for my momma ♪ Well, it's about time... -Let me hear it. -All right. [Chauncey] One thing people don't know is that my mom, she went to prison for a year. And it finally comes out that my mom did not do it. They dropped the charges, and she just now gets outta jail for it. After a year of her life. A year of her life that I did not see my mom. So it's, like, when me and my mom talk, it's like heart-to-heart. [stammers] I know what it is 'cause I have a mug shot, too. I went down for conspiracy with intent because of who I associated myself with. Those were conversations we never had with our kids, until after the fact. Those are conversations we should've had from our kids from the beginning. My pride was in the way 'cause I never sat down with one of my kids to know that side. So I never taught him that. And I had to stand outside, later in life, picking him up from a jail, and say, ''Dude, this is me, this is my mug shot. Never do I want your life or yours to chase you where mine chased me."

Touchdown! [chuckles] [Wagner] Do we have things that we could be doing instead of sleeping? -I got an offer from Louisville. -Okay, well, then you know what? We need to be doing what we gotta do in order to get there. -Sleeping ain't helping. -[sighs and mumbles] -Huh? -I'd rather sleep now than in class. [Wagner] I would rather you sleep at night and when you come in here, get stuff done. What do we have to do? And it's midterm, and I have midterm grades. So I'm a little, um... The first half of the semester, I'm a little lax in letting you handle your shit, but the second half of the semester, not so much. Let's go. I always handle my shit. [Wagner] Apparently not. I have your grades in my office if you would like to see them. I'm getting up. I don't understand why it has to be such a dramatic event. 'Cause I don't be bothering nobody, and then people start to bother me. You know I get my work done. I don't got no missing assignments. [Wagner] You have to put your whole address in. [Kam sighs] You have to put your e-mail address in, in order for it to log you on. No, you don't. I do it every day. I do this every day. Well, really? It keeps not putting you in. [sighs] I can't. I can't do it. [Wood] Really no motivation needed for this week. This is the team last year that you came in and handed it to 'em good at our place. We had the deal at Delta the following week, and then we go from being third, to dropping down to ninth. They going from being fifth, moving up to one. {\an8}They ended up getting to play the team out of, I think, Minnesota for the title. {\an8}This is the defending national champion that you get to play. [De'Andre] They're the number one team as of right now. So now it's, like, gonna take what's ours. {\an8}Get out our throne and let us sit back down. {\an8}[stammering] You know, so it's gonna be a grudge match. [Buddy] You get to play the guys that had the asterisk. They won your ring last year. You know that. They know that. This is a big week as far as, uh, you moving up and putting yourself into a national championship picture. Bottom line. [Ed Holly] When the pressure gets him, make the play! -[coach] Hey. Right there. Hold it. -[whistle blows] -[indistinct yelling] -[Ed Holly] Stand up to the pressure. [Isaiah] Hey, don't get scared. Don't get scared. Don't get scared. [players grunting] -[Chauncey] That's a sack! -[Isaiah] That's not a damn sack. [Chauncey] Y'all gonna bullshit? That's a sack. -[Isaiah] That ain't no sack. -[Chauncey] Can't guard me. -[Isaiah] That ain't no sack. -[Chauncey] They can't guard me. -[Isaiah] That ain't no sack. -[Chauncey] That's a sack. -They can't guard me. -[coach] All right, Chauncey. -[Chauncey] Can't guard me. It's a sack. -Fuck is that a sack if you blocked? -Can't fucking guard me. -Chauncey, you sorry, dog. -I don't give a fuck. You can't guard me. -Bitch, you can't tackle me. If he was tackling, we'd have been scoring. -[coach] That's the way to stop. -You don't think so? -[Johnson] I said, "I don't disagree." -I was about to say. [Johnson] Good Lord, man. Jeez. You got too much hatred in you, man. They hungry, bro. Leave them alone. They hungry, bro. Hey, look. Hey, calm down, lap dog. [player 1] He called you a lap dog. No, I ain't listening to that. That why I'm talking, son. [Isaiah] How you sacked and I got you pushed to the outside? -[Johnson] Brooks, come yank his leash. -[player 2] Better listen to that man. You need to be telling Zeke to stay on the outside. Your dog's getting a little too feisty while you got him on the chain. [Mario] That's the point. We ain't never been on no chain. We been running this shit since. [player 1] I run this shit Saturday. [Mario] He gonna get his ass beat, he keep playing. [chuckles] [Buddy] Good day today. Let's go. Break it down. Hurry. [player] Lions on three, champs on six. -One, two, three. -[all] Lions! -[player] Four, five, six. -[all] Champs! [Buddy] Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell's wrong with y'all? Seriously? [stammering] Y'all got everything in front of you. You got everything in front of you and there's not a lot of excitement going on right now. Hey, you better understand what you got in front of you and take advantage of it. You guys that were on this team last year, you were in this position, it was taken from you. Now, by God, go out and take this from them. You understand? Hey, don't be pissing around with it. If you don't wanna be out here, don't be, but the guys that wanna play, be on that field on Saturday. Now come on, dadgummit, break this shit down and let's go. Let's go, break it down. Loud. [player] Lions on three, champs on six. -One, two, three. -[all] Lions! -[player] Four, five, six. -[all] Champs! -[Buddy] There you go! -[Williams] Kam! Kam! [Maleke] He called 'em bitches. -[Williams] Kam! Come here, come here. -[Maleke] I don't know why he did. I had to straighten him out for that. He was like, "Man, them bitches trippin', man." Yeah, you gotta roll him, homey. They don't talk to these women like that. Ain't that right? [Williams] 'Cause you called them girls bitches. -I mean, I didn't say it to their face. -[Williams chuckles] Just 'cause your back was turned, don't mean that they didn't hear you. [Kam] It wasn't intended for them to hear. [Williams] You shouldn't have said it. Man, I stick to what I said. -You stick to what? -What I said. -What that mean? -I don't know. I don't know. [Williams] Stop. What that mean? [Kam] What I said about them. They're snitches now, too. [Williams] Oh, hell, we got... What's 120 plus two? Plus times two times two. [Kam] Hey, chill. -[Williams] Huh? -Chill. -[Williams] You stick to what you said? -Yes. [Williams] Okay, well, we gonna head down and back then. -[Kam] Why? -You stick to what you said. -[Kam] Why? -'Cause... -[Kam] Coach. -Let's go! -[Kam] That's not fair. -That is fair. [Williams] It ain't fair for you to be calling young girls the b-word -when they doing their damn job. -[grunts] [Williams] Come on, son. Pick it up, man. Stop fighting this shit and just do it. Let's go, son. I gotta go eat. [Kam] Man, this is getting fucked. [Williams] Keep going, let's go, man. Come on. [Kam grunts] I hope my daughter never snitch. [Williams] Bet you be lucky you rolling, 'cause if you was anybody else, you'd have been beat up, shot or killed. -Ready? -Huh? -You ready? -For what? Go back to the 50. You said 120, Coach. I said depending on how you did that one, depending on if you got another one. I did that zone good. No, that's a negative. You stopped four times. Man, 'cause I called some girls some bitches. Yeah. That's why. Would you want somebody calling your mama that? Or calling your grandma that? -Come on. Let's go. -Coach. [grunting] Fucking bitches. [Williams] Straighten up! Don't stop! Don't stop. -Turn this way! -[Kam] What way? I don't see you! [Williams] Let's go! I'm right here. Let's go, son. [Williams laughing] Hey, he had enough? Has he had enough? Y'all call it. [woman] Yes. -[Kam] Damn, son. -[Williams] Hey, let's go, man. Get up! [Kam grunts] Fuck. I ain't doing that apologizing shit. Those girls just saved you. You're not gonna go apologize to 'em? -No, I don't fuck with them. -Huh? I don't fuck with them. -Is that how you're gonna act? -Yeah. -Why? -'Cause... You disrespected them, they turned around and was nice to you, told me to leave you alone. And you don't have the... You don't think you need to apologize to 'em? Huh? -No. -You gonna have a long life, son. A long, hard life 'cause of that. Long, hard life. [Tim] You gonna be here tomorrow? {\an8}[Tim's brother] What time? Tomorrow at 2:00? {\an8}Yeah, two o'clock. I need me some sacks, bro. I'm the only one on D-line ain't got no sacks, bro. Shit flew by too quick, bro. [stammers] Hey, you seen that new... that new video-- Man, I don't give a damn about no video game either, boy. Called Battlefield. Oh, boy, I'm about to hang up the phone on you, bro. Dog, come on. I ain't even doing nothing for real, I'm just talking to you. Man, I just wanna talk to you. I don't wanna hear about  no train, no truck. Boy, I'm hurting right now, nigga, I ain't got no sacks, boy. [both laughing] [Williams] You know, sometimes, man, I struggle with believing. I struggle in believing in some things, you know. I struggle in believing that, you know... I'm coaching football for a living. Can't believe it, but I'm doing it, you know. I even struggle sometimes in believing that my girlfriend love me. You know, it's tough. -[scattered laughter] -But she do. I wanna let you guys know, despite all the frustration we've been through since training camp, me getting on you, you walking off the field, y'all snapping back, me getting loud, me running and going overboard... Despite of all that, guys, I believe in y'all. [Kam] You rolling us... -Me rolling y'all. I believe in y'all. -[players laughing] I believe in y'all, guys. If we go out and stop the run, I believe we gonna win. Okay? I believe once we stop the run, we're gonna have to pass rush. I believe we gonna get some sacks tomorrow. I believe that 'cause I believe in y'all. Okay? Now me believing in you guys don't mean a hill of beans if you don't believe in yourself. We all have to believe in ourselves. 'Cause I do believe in you. [indistinct chatter] [Williams] Hey, man. Hey, come here, man. Come here. Are you a person that believes in what people-- -Yo, I got confidence in myself. -No! Just wait. Let me finish. Are you a person that believes in what people say or what people do? -I believe in what you say. -Well, you need to believe in what I do. -Mm-hmm. -I have never benched you, right? Okay, so the fact that you keep going in ball games, what'd that let you know? You trust me. That I believe in you. Believe is the key word. You understand? Okay? When I was sitting there and gave that speech, -I gave that speech to you. -Yes, sir. -I need you to ball tomorrow now. -I got you. Okay. Don't have me, have you. Yeah, I got me. But at the same time, I got you. 'Cause you my coach, you gotta coach me. -All right, all right. I hear you. -Hey. Look here. I got you. I mean, I got me too, but I got you, too. -All right. -But look here. Put Bino in, see what happens. -Who is Bino? -Me. Put me in and see what happens. Coach, I promise you. After I get some good sleep tonight, I'm gonna put that Boosie Baby, DB loop on. -I'm gonna go out, boy. -[Williams laughing] Boosie, well, well, well.

[Crowder] Good afternoon, fans, and welcome inside Sullivan-Windham Field, where it's a top five battle, where the number one team is not the home team. That's a big rarity here in Scooba, Mississippi. The number one team, Northwest, are the reigning national champions. Put an asterisk by it because EMCC beat this team by three touchdowns a year ago. [Wood] Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go! Offense! [Crowder] If EMCC can win today, they might put themselves in that position. Johnson has pressure, but on the near side now. Steps up, has a wide-open field. First down. [Wood] Good job, attababy! [Winfield] De'Andre Johnson might be the best example of a dual-threat quarterback I have ever seen. Hey! Tomahawk right! Tomahawk right! Tomahawk right! [player] East, east, east! [Crowder] Snap to Johnson, back to pass, pocket collapses. -Fires it over the middle. -[player] There it is! Caught! Ten-yard line, five-yard line... Touchdown, EMCC! And they lead it, 6-nothing. They strike first blood. -[Wood] Attaboy. -[Buddy] Good job! Attababy! Good job, good job. Good shit, good shit. [Crowder] Thirteenth touchdown pass  thrown by De'Andre Johnson. EMCC leads it, 7-nothing. [Buddy] Keep coming off the ball! You understand? Come off the ball and punch 'em in the mouth. {\an8}Let's go, D. {\an8}[Crowder] It was the defense that really took a hit this past week by their play at Holmes. [Winfield]  They got back to the basics on defense. Gotta lock up a little bit and tackle now and then. [Crowder] The snap to hold Holgorsen, back to pass, has pressure, he's hit. He's dropped and sacked at the 32... -[Williams] Good job! -Get him! Let's go! [Williams] That's it! That's what I'm talkin' about, 29! Good job! That's it, boy! That's it! That's how you get after the damn quarterback. You understand? That's how you get after the quarterback. All day. Whoo! {\an8}Boy. That shit feels so good, boy. {\an8}[Crowder] Big-time sack and hit by EMCC. Is that Ezekiel Rose? [Winfield] It is Ezekiel Rose. How you didn't kill his ass, Zeke? You shoulda killed his ass. He didn't even see you comin', bro, you had a full... Talkin' about-- I didn't wanna go low. They were gonna throw a flag. Go low! I was finna knock his ass out. We were finna hit his ass just like that, bro. I'm gonna have that motherfuckin' sack. I'm gonna get that bitch today, boy. [Crowder] So with 6:14 to go, EMCC gets the ball back. Here's the snap. They leave it with Wright. Big hole behind left guard. First down and more. He's bowlin' through people and being held on by the back of his jersey. Boy, what an explosive play. [Winfield] One of the things you wanted to see out of this team was fire. You wanted to see if they would come out and play with an edge today. Look at Isaiah Wright just dragging tackles on the block. Get out! Get out! {\an8}Let's go. Come on, let's go! {\an8}[Crowder] So empty backfield for Johnson and third down in 15 from the 40 of Northwest. Back to pass, has all day. Fires it deep towards the end zone and it is caught! Touchdown, EMCC! [Earl shouts and laughs] Yeah! [Crowder] Oh, my goodness, what a reception! Attababy! Touchdown! Attababy! Come on, we need that shit. [Winfield] He had no end zone to spare when he caught that football before he was out of the end zone. [Crowder] And EMCC leads it 17-nothing here in the second quarter. Hey, let's go! Let's go, D! [Crowder] EMCC on top but number one, Northwest, is threatening with a first and goal, down to the EMCC five. The snap to Holgorsen, and he's gonna throw it. Slant, caught, touchdown, Northwest, from five yards out, near side. [Ed Holly] Man coverage on the slant. We gotta win. Come on. That's our best corner, he's gotta win. Hey! That's your best D? -Here we go, here we go. -[Williams] We gotta do a better job now. {\an8}[Crowder] And it's 17-7, so it's a ten-point game here in Scooba. Hold on, it's not a blow out yet. It's gonna be interesting to see how they respond emotionally. -[De'Andre] East! -[Crowder] Here's the snap. Johnson, looking towards Wright. Back side pressure's gonna bring him down at the 41-yard line. -[Buddy] Isaiah! -[Isaiah groans] Don't do that, Isaiah! -[Isaiah] Fuck! -[Buddy] Let's go! [Crowder] Snap from the 31, they leave it on the ground. Wright. Trying to get around right hand. Gonna split defenders. And his knee's gonna go down around the 26. [Buddy] Get him up. Get him up, get him up. Get up, get up. Get up! [Isaiah] They're tryin' to fuck me up. [Crowder] It looks like Isaiah Wright was injured. [Isaiah] Oh! Fell on the back of my ankle! [Buddy] Zay! I don't want you... Come here. Look at me. Don't limp. Don't show 'em no weakness, you understand? -[Isaiah] That face mask-- -I know. I know, I know. You okay? [Isaiah] No, he fell on the back of my ankle. [Crowder] His injury looked bad. He's got a high ankle sprain. [Isaiah] Oh, fuck! [groans] It's okay, just breathe. I can't even put my weight on it. [Crowder] High ankle sprain is the worst you can get, and it's the longest to recover from. {\an8}Jacquez Horsley replaces him. He's in motion and now sets up to the left of Johnson in the backfield. They'll leave it with Horsley, he bowls up the middle, working his legs, dive to the goal line. Touchdown, EMCC! [crowd cheering] [Winfield] What will they say about Horsley? He's a guy who does not go down on first contact. He took a hit at the two... [Buddy] Just roll 'em. We'll be okay with Isaiah out. We're okay with Isaiah out. [Crowder] And EMCC's up two touchdowns again. {\an8}All the marbles are out there. {\an8}If EMCC wins, they're guaranteed to host first round to the playoffs. [Williams] Go get 'em! Go get 'em! [Crowder] Holgorsen fires it near side. Receiver slipped down. He was nowhere near it and it falls incomplete. [Winfield] Oh, but we're going to have a flag. -[Williams] Hey, who was that? -[Winfield] And it's not a good one, Glen. {\an8}[Buddy] Chauncey! {\an8}[Williams] Come on, Chauncey, be careful now! {\an8}[Ed Holly] Let's just play. Had 'em fucking stopped. [Beard] That's gonna be Chauncey Rivers. He's guilty of the face mask right there. Let's go. Let's go. [Crowder] First down, ten to go. After that face mask, EMCC's gonna jump offside for the right side free play, and it's a fade paddle, and it's gonna be intercepted by EMCC at the 39. But this one's gonna be coming back. [Buddy] No. Hey! We're offside. [Trickett] Oh, dumbass, Chauncey. Fucking Chauncey. [Buddy] Chauncey! Get over here! [Williams] Come on, Chauncey! [Beard] Yeah, Chauncey just jumped the gun a little bit right there. Too early. [indistinct chattering] [Buddy] Chauncey, shut the fuck up or either go back over there and sit down and take off... Hey. Hey, Chauncey, Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey. Chauncey, come here, man. Come here, Chauncey. Hey, Chauncey, come here. Hey. I'm about that close to tellin' you to take your shit and go. You understand? -[Chauncey] Yeah. -You understand me? No, ain't no "yeah." It's "yes, sir." Understand? -[Chauncey] I got you. -Ain't no "got you." Watch the dadgum ball and play like you're supposed to play. Get off the field! Get off the field! [marching band playing] Hey. Get away from me right now. [Winfield] Now you need the defense to step up for East Mississippi. You had a 17-nothing lead and you do not want to turn this into a one-score game. But Rangers have a chance to do that if they can put together a drive. [Crowder] EMCC showing pressure. Here they come. Back to pass, firing it deep down the near sideline and it's caught inside the 30. [Winfield] All of a sudden, this Northwest team that just looked incompetent in the first quarter, looking proficient here in the second. We got it. We're there. We just gotta make it. We got it. Orange, orange, orange, orange, orange. [Crowder] Here's the snap. Back to pass, fires it near side towards the end zone, and it is caught... -Touchdown! -[crowd cheering] Boy, and I'll tell you what. Northwest made this game interesting. It was 17-nothing. All of a sudden, bam! I'm trying, I'm trying. I swear to goodness, I'm trying. "I'm two seconds away from telling you to take your shit off"? Man, get the... Hey, hey, Chauncey. Keep ballin'. You understand? The game is bigger than what you talkin' about right now. [Crowder] That's your score at the half. 24-17 in this top five battle. Boy, hold on, Charlie. This second half is gonna be a fun one. We'll be back with Charlie... [Buddy] Defense, you gotta get us a stop. I can't be at another track meet, I promise you. You bring the shit now and play hard. No stupid penalties. We don't have stupid penalties and we don't have stupid blown assignments. It ain't even close! It ain't even close! It's there for you to take. It's there for you to take. Are you going to take it? [door thuds] [Williams] Hey, listen. This team that we're playing right now, okay, is not a better team than you are. We have to come out this second half and we have to take control of the ball. Okay? Let's kill it. Let's kill it. Come out here with this energy, them three sacks that we didn't get the first half? Let's give them three sacks this half. We can do this. We can do this. Okay? This group can do this. Y'all good? Come on now. Make a difference now, okay? Let's go. Get up. Get up. Let's go. Break it down. [Winfield] One thing Buddy Stephens talked about was wanting some of that swagger. I tend to think that swagger is earned a little bit. You have to earn the right to have an edge. [Crowder] I agree. [Winfield] If you wanna be the best team in the country, it's not going to come easy. Now and then, you're gonna have to rely on your defense to get back out on the field and make some plays. This is one of those times. Really a gut check here for the Lion defense. [players grunting] [Williams] There you go! [Crowder] Back to pass... Pressure! He's sacked inside the 20, back at the 18-yard line. Attaboy, Tim. Attaboy, Tim. [laughs] There you go, boy! Good job! {\an8}[Crowder] Coming up with a sack, Bonner! {\an8}[Williams] Yeah! That's it, boy! -Way to go, D-line. -[Crowder] Huge hit. Good job, boy! [Crowder] Just absolutely creams him at the nine-yard line. -[Ezekiel] There you go! -[Williams] Good job. I talked about getting that, didn't I? That's how you affect the game. [indistinct chattering and rapping] Great job, man! Good job, man! [Winfield] He has shown an ability to make some big hits, and now... Let's go, let's go. Hurry up! ...it gives them a chance to have a good setup for offense. [Crowder] Johnson takes the snap, fires it left side... -Touchdown, EMCC! -Well done. [Winfield] Oh, my goodness, what a fast ball! {\an8}[Crowder] And EMCC stretches the lead to two scores. [De'Andre] Hey, did y'all hear that shit? Boom! I took his chest out. [Beard] De'Andre throws the slant harder than anybody I have ever seen. [Crowder] This is fantastic. Here's the kick. Taken inside the five. Right across the 20 and... Looks like it's gonna be flipped up around the 27-yard line. -Oh, goodness gracious. -[all cheering] [Winfield] You've got 'em where you want 'em, now we're gonna rough 'em up. -[Rock City's "I'm That" playing] -♪ We coming, we coming ♪ ♪ We coming ♪ ♪ Sim simma ♪ Don't stop! Full speed attack! [Winfield] Looked like he had been shot out of a cannon that time. The defensive line starting to be a factor. -[Williams] Right away, D! Good job! -[Ed Holly] Love it! That was pretty damn good, man. ♪ All you ever been Was a shoulda, coulda, woulda ♪ -[Crowder] Here's the snap. -Get him! [Crowder] Back side pressure. Hit, drop, sacked! -[Devaunya] Get him! -[Crowder] Chauncey Rivers! [Williams] Good job, baby! Whoo! {\an8}Hey, Chauncey, you got him! {\an8}[Crowder] If you're chased by Chauncey Rivers {\an8}all day, that'll give you nightmares. [Winfield] I don't wanna do it. [Crowder] Pressure, he's hit. He's going down at the 20-yard line... {\an8}-[Ed Holly] Yes! -[Winfield] Kam Carter. {\an8}[Crowder] Look at this defensive line. {\an8}They're dancing to the music. They're having a good time. And the offense, they have a little bit to dance about, too. Fires it deep towards the end zone... It's caught! Touchdown, EMCC! EMCC has busted this game open, 43-25. Back to pass, has pressure, can't avoid it. -And it's gonna be Bonner. -[Williams squeals] There ya go, Tim! There ya go, boy! There ya go! [Crowder] Tim Bonner is gonna come up with a huge, huge sack. [Williams] Take him down! Take him down! [Crowder] Diamante Pounds knocks the ball out! EMCC's gonna pick it up at the 31-yard line! [Winfield] Tim Bonner to pick up the fumble. [Ed Holly] That's our ball, that's our ball! Whoo! [Tim] Got that boy fumblin'-bumblin'. ♪ Sim simma ♪ [Crowder] Boy, that defensive front really has stepped up. [player] That's what I'm talking about! -I got too excited. -[Williams] Good game! I got a little bit too excited. [Crowder] Bingo! This one is in the books. Buddy Stephens and his football team came out and showed tenacity for four quarters, and defensively, blew up a bit. [Williams grunts] [Crowder] And EMCC wins it, 51-32 in a top five battle here at homecoming in Scooba. -Boy, y'all stupid, man. -[laughs] -You deserve it! Yo! -Y'all stupid. [laughs] You deserve it, Coach! Bang on! Man, y'all was ballin', man. Good game, boy. I'm proud of you, man. Proud of you. [Winfield] EMCC has served notice that it is the best team in junior college football. -All right! -[Tim] Come on, boy. -[speaking indistinctly] -I got you. [man] Keep your head up. Hey, bud. Hey! -Hey, babe. -Oh, you look good. It is. -[Ezekiel] You doin' all right? -You doin' all right? -Good game, man. -[Ezekiel] I'm alive. [Devaunya] I'm proud of y'all today. Y'all had some struggles. -[man] Yeah, you all overcame. -[Devaunya] I was under straight duress. [chuckling] [man] Chauncey, nobody can hold you back, man. [Devaunya] Ain't nobody holding you back but you. Ain't nobody holding you back right now but you. This is supposed to be a pit stop in your life. Have fun, play ball, but keep your eye on the prize. [Devaunya] Getting up out of Scooba in the best situation possible. You need to look around, you need to stand out here and see. Half these people you play with, two-thirds of these people you play with, 90% of these people you play with are never gonna go where you, 14 went, where John went, where Isaiah gonna go. They're not y'all. But you can end up like everybody else. You could be one injury away from not playing. You could be one bad decision away from your career being a past history. Be another nigga caught up in the system. Another nigga who got arrested for some shit. Another nigga who didn't graduate from college. Another black man with talent wasted. -[man] You can't... You gotta... -Wasted. You gotta be committed and say, "Okay, this is what I'm gonna do for the rest of my life." [Devaunya] Rest of my life. God sent you down for a reason. This is supposed to be the one time you get at another redo, son. I don't have no more tears to be sitting there looking at another mug shot. Eye on the prize.
