 Since taking an adult responsibility adding yourself to the church, you'll belong to him now, and just like he tells us in Joshua 1:5, "He'll never leave me, He'll never forsake me." And just like in the Bible, I want to hear you confess Christ is the son of God. I believe that Jesus Christ is God's son, and that he died for my sins. [Dakota] In my household where I grew up, {\an8}we weren't really a religious family, you know. {\an8}And I really wanted to get religious... because... because I know God has a plan for me, you know what I mean.

 And that's why I feel like I'm here in Scooba, Mississippi. Dakota, my brother, I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son... and the Holy Spirit. [chuckles] -Love you, brother. -[Wood] There you go, buddy. [Dakota] Who knew I would have came to Scooba, Mississippi, and... and find Christ, and get saved, you know.

It's a daily struggle, it's a daily walk. If I don't take time to slow down, uh, and, uh... and have a devotional every day, I can get outta whack pretty quick. Make sure everybody knows what the goddamn play is! D-Co! [screams] I'm still gonna get mad when they're not performing like they're supposed to be. That's my job, that you're there pushing them. And, um... sometimes that requires, um, you to do it in a loving way, and sometimes you have to do it in a very harsh way. You know, I don't know how I'm doing. Uh, I guess I'll wait till the documentary comes out to see. -[device ringing] -[De'Andre] What's going on, Dr. Ron? [Dr. Ronald] Oh, well... {\an8}Uh, sorry I missed you at the game. {\an8}Yeah, yeah... [stuttering] How did the game go? Tell me. I don't think, you know, that we really came to play. You know, I think we really underestimated them guys. Yeah. But it lasted about five minutes, you know... Well, like that, you get into the groove. [stutters] Right, you know, I made my mind up, you know, not to worry about it and just, you know, to get used to it. You gotta play it anyway. -You know, just went out there and did it. -Right. [chuckles] Just one of them games where you just go toe-to-toe, you know. They score, we score. We score, they score. Eventually, somebody gotta... Somebody had to get stopped. It's not gonna be us. So it was them. Yeah, this is the game ball. Think it was the first game ball Coach Stephens ever gave out. -[whistle blowing] -[Buddy] Hey! Shut up and listen to what's going on! Be where you're supposed to be, people! All that clowning around before last week, got 42 on your ass. Listen to what's going on! Know where you're supposed to be! -[player] ICC dropped 42 on y'all boys. -Damn! {\an8}-You let him talk to you like that, huh? -He ain't talking to me. {\an8}[imitating Buddy] I'd like y'all to know where you're running. [player chuckles] [Maleke] Defense left a whole lot of plays out there. A whole lot. -Why Coach Stephens was so hot. -[Jacquez chuckles] I'm glad he a changed man. 'Cause last year... Boy, Coach Stephens would have cussed our ass out bad. Bro, he should've still had some of that last year in him this year. 'Cause, I mean, this year, even though he softened up, -they slack off. -Yeah. Last year, bro, it was a rout. -Defense wouldn't let nothin' go. -Yeah. Isaiah was snappin' out, bro. I see where he was coming from, because, I mean, in this league, you can't miss that many games, or they will take your offers away. You can be the number one guy but still get hurt {\an8}and your season over with, {\an8}'cause they got somebody else in your position that ain't hurt. He had a concussion, so he can... Really can't stress that, or he end up like Coach Trickett. Ain't no reason to risk no injury like that, 'cause I mean, you need your head even for football or not. I don't wanna have a job one day and be crazy, and just go off with a job and then you end up getting fired. And you ain't got nothing, 'cause football gone. Football is a temporary thing. It ain't forever. [indistinct chatter] [Wagner] I don't understand why he was acting the way he was after they took him out. You mad 'cause they took you out, but... you just had a concussion, so it's your fault you went to the coach talkin' 'bout your head hurt. [player] They don't wanna tell the coaches they got a concussion. [Wagner] But why don't they? Look what happened to me, my shit got pulled. -[Wagner] All right. -It's just business. -Scholarships. -Scholarships! [Wagner] But does he have a concussion? -Yes, he got a concussion. -Yeah. [Wagner] Then why are we playing him? Like, to me, you go to the doctor, and you have a concussion or you don't. -The thing is... -I don't care what-- They tell the player one thing, tell the coach another. Yo. [Bontrager] How was practice? Fine. How do you feel? I mean... {\an8}I feel... like how I usually feel after I practice. {\an8}I don't got no headache. -And then-- -Anything else? Dizziness? Pressure in head? -Difficulty concentrating? -Mmm-mmm. Nothing? [Wagner] I understand this is his whole future, and... his well-being is on the line, you know, when he leaves here with what he does on the field, but he just kind of lost it. I mean, he was so negative. And there were coaches there on that... Mississippi State was there, and I mean if... if you were on our sideline, you saw him and you heard him. So there was no denying that he was throwing a temper tantrum. And if too many coaches see that... he's gonna shoot himself in the foot, because coaches don't... They don't want that cancer, that negativity, you know. -I just need some... -[player speaks indistinctly] -I need some more Advil stuff. -[Bontrager] Got you. [Wagner] A brain injury is bigger than a game. I mean, that... that's a long-term, serious thing to mess around with. And I don't think an 18, 19-year-old understands the long-term effects of that. To them, they're invincible, "I'll be fine. Just... My head hurts." I get that their futures are on the line, but I don't know. I think their futures are on the line either way. [speaking indistinctly] All right, yeah. Keep throwin' that shit at me. [chuckles] -Keep throwin' that shit at me. -Listen, that's not funny. -Keep throwin' shit. -[laughs] Stop! That's not fair. You can't... I... All right. [laughs] -I'm sorry. [chuckles] -Ouch. [Jazlyn] He was mad. He wasn't looking at it from them being concerned about him, or he was like... {\an8}"They shouldn't have pulled me from the game." {\an8}And I was there, I was like, "Well, just calm down," {\an8}and he was like, "No!" And, like, it just... It took a lot to calm him down. Like, it takes a lot to calm him down. He calmed down. It took a day or two or three. [Isaiah] Sometimes, we... we hold all that anger in, and just when it... it wants to crack and open up, we gotta let it out. I'm big with football, that's, like, my whole life. I've been doing that since I can walk. And when they told me I couldn't play because of a little concussion, I was feeling like, "I'm straight." I ain't worried about no concussion. I want to play football. [stuttering] I'd rather... I'd rather get hurt on the field instead of not playing. [Jazlyn] He can be hard to deal with. Sometimes he has his stubborn days to where you have to push him more than usual. But he has a reason to be hard, he has a reason to be uptight. It's because of what he went through. He's not the type of person that just let everybody into his... his world. [Isaiah] I'm very... I'm very picky on people I hang with. I have a trust issue, and then issues with, like, expressing my emotions with people. Like, she the only person I express my full emotions to. She's just one of them ones I can talk to. [Jazlyn] He used to tell me, like, people say, "Have you ever, like, wondered, like, where... where your mom was?" He was like, "Yeah. I was a kid." He was like, "I was six years old." He was like, "Of course I wondered," like... He's like, "I look at the door, like, is she gonna come back today?" I mean, there have been times where... he has been, like, sad to the point where I had to, like, sit on the phone for, like, four or five hours. Four or five hours, just listening to him talk. He'll be like, "There is something wrong with me. I was a problem." Like... You were never the problem, you were a baby. How could you be a problem? Or he felt like nobody cared about him. Or he felt like nobody wanted him. Like, that's all he wants, like... somebody to care about him. Just to care. Just to say, "I care about you." [indistinct chatter] [Wagner] Were you there the whole weekend? {\an8}-Mm-hmm. It was fun. -[Wagner] I'm sure it was. {\an8}Yeah, it was fun. Think I'm in love with Ole Miss. In love? With Ole Miss? -And their women. -Oh, dear. But let's make a smart decision. -Is that the best place for you? -True that. Yes, ma'am. Is a party place with a lot of beautiful women really gonna be the best place for you? So what's the best place for me? I'm asking. I don't know the answer. -[stutters] No women, military, uh... -I don't know the answer to the question. -I'm just asking you to think about it. -Oh, okay. I got you. Something for me to think about. [Wagner] Mm-hmm.  You'll get in trouble with your woman. [Dakota] Mmm-mmm. Get in trouble with the law. I... I have a curfew. -[Wagner] What's your curfew? -I think 11:00. -You think? -Yeah. How come you don't know? It's something like that. It's an outrageous... outrageous, uh, time. Like, they can take me right back to jail if I'm out. [chuckles] -Well, I don't really need that to happen. -Mmm-mmm. We both don't need that to happen. -Did you have to spend the night? -Damn near. I was there all the way till about 3:30 the next morning. -It sucked. -Were you scared? I wasn't scared. I was just... mad and bored. -Mad at what? At yourself? -Mm-hmm. Mad at myself. I got involved in some... In some legal trouble, you know, some... I got involved with people I shouldn't have been involved with. And then... [sighs] I'm sorry, it's like, it's something hard to talk about. Uh... They ended up charging me with a second degree felony of a burglary of habitation. So, of course, Coach Kingsbury kicked me and two other players off the team, 'cause they were charged with the same. I went home, back to Humble in Houston after that. And for a long time, I thought I was never gonna play football again. And it was truly the worst feeling I ever had in my life. I talked to, uh, Tech yesterday. I have to, basically, write an, uh, appeal... Like, why they should let me back on the campus. 'Cause now, I can't... I'm not even allowed back on campus until January 2018. At Texas Tech, I used to wake up and dread practice, and... and just dread going to school, but now when I wake up, I just thank God that... that God woke me up. I'm just thankful to be alive every day. I'm just... I'm just thankful to follow his plan. And I'm... and I'm anxious to see what he has in store for me. [Ed Holly] There's two things we emphasize this week! Two! {\an8}Not 40, not 50! Two! {\an8}Run to the ball and tackle. {\an8}So, number one, keys to success, run to the football. Run to the football. Hunt together. Lions hunt in a pack. Hunt together. Number two, tackling. Guys, we have to show the entire state of Mississippi that we are, without a doubt, the most physical, dominating presence on defense, and we haven't done that yet. We go out on that field, we just have to execute it. Over the top, over the top. No! You know, we're a result-driven business, and then if you don't produce on the field, you're not gonna be able to sit in this seat. We struggled a bit at Itawamba, and we didn't make the plays we had to, and thank God, we got the best offense in the country, 'cause they saved our tail. -Do it again, do it again! -[player] Reload, reload! [Ed Holly] But for us, East Mississippi doesn't give up 30-plus points. And to be honest with you, it was, it was my fault. We can't give up those points. And if we do, there's a problem. And I gotta fix that problem. -[player 1] Reset! -[Ed Holly] Move, move! Get over the top! -[players grunting and chattering] -[Ed Holly] If I feel downhill on a pull, when that guard pulls, I gotta be drawing with him. So you have to take all responsibilities. Yes, your entire existence revolves on 17, 18, and 19-year-old kids. [Buddy] Get down! Rodney, line up here and go there. [Rodney] Reset! Set it, set it, set it. Well... I got him, Coach! Coach, I got him! -[player] Coach Williams! -I got him! [Isaiah] Coach think our defense suspect. I don't like this shit, man. For real. We need to blame everybody but the offense. We gotta come out strong. [player] Hey, real talk, bro. For real. [Isaiah] They're being real, they think our defense suspect. [Isaiah] D-block on me, D-block on three. One, two, three. -[players] D-block. -[indistinct chatter] [Ed Holly] Let's be honest, if I was a bank teller and I have a bad day, I would know and my boss would know. But when I have a bad day or the defense has a bad day, 5,000 people know, everybody in the community knows, and not only do I feel it, but the family feels it. The kids go to school, they, you know, hear things, they go on the playground, they hear things. Everybody knows what Dad does and it can be pretty rough on 'em  sometimes now. I mean, that's... I say, guys, we're tough now. We don't say anything back, we just go forward, and trust me, I'll get it fixed. [Ed Holly] All right, I will be home. I will not be home at all this week for supper. [Holly] What about Friday night? Friday night, she has another dance... -thing on Friday. -[girl] I have dance... Does that mean the three boys have to go? -Oh. -[boy] Oh. What time is your dance Friday? I dance from 6:30 for the rest of the night. -Tuesday I have it from 5:30 to... 9:00. -Um... [Holly] 4:00 to 5:30. I will do my best to get off this, um... Yeah... -[Holly] At 4:00. Not gonna happen. -[boy] We can come. That's not gonna happen 'cause I'm gonna be in North Mississippi till Friday. -4:00 to 5:30. -[boy] Can I come with you? -I wish, buddy. -[Holly] We met at Florida. At the University of Florida. Go Gators. Uh, I saw him and he came up and started talking to me and he said, "What's your name?" I said, "Holly." {\an8}And he goes, "My name's Ed Holly." And I was like, "No, it's not." {\an8}[chuckles] So he took out his license and showed it to me, and I was like, "Whatever." You're just some guy I just met. -[girl] Good job, Daddy. -That was the master plan. [all laugh] -[Holly] It is very hectic. -[children chattering] It's very hectic during the season. We've been married 19 years and we've moved... -um... I think 12. -A lot. Well, this was, like, our 13th move so we've moved a lot. We didn't hang pictures 'cause I thought, "It's too close to December." And every coach's wife in America holds their breath for the month of December and January because coaches get fired, coaches get hired and coaches move. And if I hang pictures on the wall... if I buy a rug, if I buy a dining room table... then we're gonna move. Then it's just Murphy's Law that something will happen and come up and we'll move again so, no pictures on the wall. If we make it through this December and January with nothing happening... February... I'm gonna hang pictures up. [laughs] Then we'll move into the house officially. [players chattering indistinctly] [Wagner] Why are your hand in your pants? Really? [Kam] Huh? -[Wagner] Really? -[player 1] Bro. Bro. Bro, wake up. [chuckles] Get up, bro. -[snorts and grunts] -[player 2] Shit, boy. {\an8}Damn. Man, I'm tired as fuck. [Tim] Hey, Brit, somebody smoked a cigarette and put it out right there... You been smoking that Black. -Terrell "Scrubs," huh? -[Kam] Fuck with my damn jersey again. [Wagner] Tim, can we leave him alone please? [Williams] Now, let me tell you something. Today is the wrong day... to come out there and not run to the football. Okay? I don't care if the doggone ball carrier run 30 yards down the field. Run to the ball. You only got two practices out the week. But I am warnin' you right now. Okay? Nicely. -[players chuckle] -All right? You see this, right? I am warning you right now, okay? If you guys do not run to the football, it's gonna be trouble in the water. And that's comin' from up top. I'm telling you now, do not come... I don't care where your feelings at right now, I don't care what's going on in your life right now, but if your ass ain't running to that ball, there's gonna be trouble. All right, walk towards 255, hurry up. Come on, Kam! Stop going through the damn motions. [Ed Holly] Let's go. We should be already done with this whole fucking drill. [Williams] Run, run! Run, Kam! Run, Kam! Do you know where to run, son? Do you know where to run? Let's go! Hey, this is why we can't get lined up when we tired! This why we damn have missed tackles when we tired! [indistinct chatter] I ain't even gonna lie to you, man. Not today. Run, run to the ball! [player yelling indistinctly] Hurry up, hurry up! Hey, man, you gotta run to the ball, son. I told you. Run to the ball! [Chauncey] I can't. He already out of bounds. {\an8}Don't matter! Keep running your ass out there! {\an8}-[speaks indistinctly] -Run to the fucking ball! We will run all day long till we get it! Forty-two damn points. [Williams] Let's go, Chauncey. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up, son! Yeah, bullshit. Run to the fucking ball! {\an8}[Ed Holly] Rush! It's two minutes! -Rush! Rush! -[Williams] Rush the ball! -Damn it! -[whistle blows] Hey, Tim, you cost us two times last week. Watch the damn ball, son! Tim, watch the ball! [player] You gonna make a hell out of the practice? Damn right there's gonna be hell. I told y'all in the fucking meeting what was gonna happen. I told you! Forget your damn feelings and go hard! All I got was attitude today, so we've got four. Over and back. Twenty seconds. [whistle blowing] [Williams] Nine, eight, seven, six... -Oh, they ain't making that. -No. Stand up, guy. Stand up. Stand up, Kam. Stand tall, stand tall. -Lean on me, bro. Lean on me. -[Williams] Stand up, Jay. -Hey, stand tall, Kam. -[panting] Get your hand away from his damn neck. Stand tall. This ain't no lean on me today. [Maleke singing] ♪ Lean on me, when you're not strong... ♪ [Williams] The thing that disturbs me... I was adamant about running to the ball, and all I got was attitude. Stand up, Kam. -Man, come on, bro. Come on, bro. -[player 1] Damn, son. -Everybody ain't had no fucking water. -[panting] [Williams] Whatever... whatever it is... or whatever the reason may be... for me coaching you guys and you guys responding in that way... it needs to be fixed. You understand? I'm holding you accountable just like I'm being held accountable for my job. [marching band playing] I should go join the band. I should've been a water boy. Hell no. I... I ain't gonna be no water boy. I mean... I don't know. Shit, which one you wanna be? Water boy or the band? [Chauncey] In the NFL, them niggas get paid 50 G's. -[Tim] For real? -[Chauncey] Hell yeah. [indistinct chatter] -[Tim] You cold? -Nah. We don't need no more. [Beard] The Lions getting ready now to face off against Mississippi Delta, on Thursday night. Last year's game ended with that infamous, uh, brawl, which really kept East Mississippi out of the playoffs. So, you know, the Lions have circled this on their calendar but, look, {\an8}I mean, I don't know if Delta comes in there and tries to... create what they did last year, but... East Mississippi needs to have their heads on right, I think. [Buddy] I'm not worried about Mississippi Delta. [stammers] We have lived with this shit for a year. It's time to bury it. Okay? It's time to bury it. I don't want it... I don't want it coming out tomorrow. I want you playing ball. I don't want you playing for last year, and this year... I don't want... Hey! I want you playing ball for this game. Make sure that your sledgehammer is comin' down on the end of that chisel. Stay focused. You understand me? Stay focused. And let's beat their ass. [announcer 1] We talked to folks in Scooba, they absolutely were not wantin' to talk any revenge, -fight or brawl... -[announcer 2] Yeah. ...or anything in the past and... [announcer 3]  Keep everything civil, get up, but they probably will hang 70 on. [announcer 1] Buddy Stephens, if he has a chance, I imagine we'll see some scores but again they just, you know... Last year was last year, and it cost 'em out dearly. [Trickett] We don't want them thinking -about last year's game. -Right. It's gonna be hard. Because we're... Everyone's thinking about it. But the more we can get them to think about it being just another game, the better. [Wood] I gotta keep my composure. Be smart with what I do. Don't do anything that's stupid that affects our team. But between the whistles, I want you vicious. Just getting after 'em. [Williams] Keep your cool. Don't be pushing. Don't be fighting. Because they gonna do it, guys. The atmosphere is already set for it. It's the rematch. Don't buy into that. This team, last year, took something from us that we all worked hard for all year, that's a shot at another national championship. And you guys are saying, "I wasn't hit. Didn't take nothing away from me." Oh, yeah. It took the ability for you to have a chance to win that first ball game. [stammers] I don't look for revenge, I just look to get a little payback. And payback's a good butt-whoopin', right? [indistinct chatter and cheering] [Crowder] Number nine, EMCC taking on a north division rival in Mississippi Delta. [Winfield] We gonna score 100 tonight? [Crowder] We all know what happened in last season's game, when a 48-nothing game turned into a brawl. The game was suspended and EMCC's season was over. [Isaiah] Real shit, Kam. Get your ass to the quarterback. [Crowder] Everything's been talked about  all week about the brawl. Coach Stephens wants to put it behind them. You certainly hope that, uh, tensions will remain calm and EMCC can go out and take care of business tonight. [Winfield] What you have to do is just not let things get out of hand. Don't expect we'll have that problem. If that lesson hasn't been learned, there's nothing else that can be said or done about it. Question for me is going to be, do you come out and play with intensity and really try to put points on the board and just go ahead and have that show out game that you need? [Wood] Be aggressive right here. We're gonna go right, wide, south, 95. Go get it, boys, let's go. [Crowder] De'Andre Johnson, who has just put up video game numbers the last couple of weeks, is gonna be in the shotgun. The transfer from Florida State. Your National Junior College Athletic Association Player of the Week. He snaps it and tosses it to the tailback. He's gonna come around near side. He's gonna get out across the 45 and get to midfield, and that's gonna be Wright. Gonna be pushed out of bounds as he gets into Trojan territory. -[Buddy] That away, Isaiah. Good job. -[Wood] Here we go. [Crowder] Number four, Wright, because of injuries has been limited to 17 rushes on the season. -[Williams] Good touch. 22! -[Ed Holly] Get down! [Crowder] Johnson, twin receivers either side fake the give to Wright. Now he's gonna be back to pass. Caught at the five-yard line and stumbling towards the end zone and tackled. [Ed Holly] Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! [Crowder] Snap to Johnson. He's gonna leave it with the tailback to go up the middle... -[whistle blows] -And he's gonna have a touchdown, EMCC. The Lions are gonna jump out on top. Isaiah Wright's gonna take it and score it. Came in with just 17 rushes for 115 yards. [Winfield] Well, it took an entire minute 34 for that to happen. [Crowder] Like that, a minute and a half into the game, {\an8}the Lions on top, 7-nothing. I'm not worried about the score. I'm worried about the next drive, the next play, the next snap. Unfinished. I wanna finish this  the way it's supposed to be finished. Let's go as fast as we can go. Fast as we can go. [Crowder] Mississippi Delta is gonna come out onto the field now. It's a short end-over-end kick. Ran across the 10, 15. Gonna be hit hard. The football comes out. Around the 15 and the EMCC is falling on it -and the Lions gonna have it. -[whistle blowing] Yes, it is. EMCC ball. Boy, he got popped around the 20. He comes flying out of there. Yes! That's the way to go! [Buddy] High ball. Offense, offense, offense! Attababy, good job. Attababy, good job. [Crowder] EMCC has a chance to really blow this game open here. Wright scored his first rushing touchdown of the season a moment ago. Johnson with a snap. Screen pass, it's to Wright. He's at the five. He's gonna go to the pylon. Touchdown, EMCC! His second in the game. One on the ground and now -one through the air. -[coach] Good job. [Winfield] Boy, did Isaiah Wright show a burst of speed. Looked like a couple of defenders had an angle on him... but they just couldn't catch him. He got to the corner, got inside the pylon and, boy, that's a nice job of catching the ball out of the backfield. {\an8}[Crowder] It's 14-nothing and there's not been an offensive snap by Mississippi Delta yet. [Trickett chuckles] It's their first play. 14-nothing and their first play... That sucks. [Crowder] Meyers with the snap, play action, look in that pocket. Collapses. He's gonna be slung down -and sacked inside the 25. -[Williams] There you go. [Crowder] Kam Carter is gonna lead the charge there. [Williams] Good job! [Isaiah] Hey, that shit dead. That shit dead as fuck. [Crowder] Here's Johnson. Going to leave it with his tailback, he bounces up the middle, now bounces out to the near side and, uh... splitting two defenders, is gonna be Isaiah Wright. [Buddy] Attaboy! Hey, attaboy right there! Good job, attababy! Attababy! [Isaiah chuckles] Whoo! Oh, shit. Okay, Saih! Okay, Saih! Okay, Saih! [Crowder] My goodness, what a hit. [Chauncey] He made 'em hit the weight room. Hey, they skipping reps. [Isaiah] Let's go, let's go! [Crowder] Down to the one-yard line of Mississippi Delta, here's the snap, they leave it with Wright. Wright up the middle. -Wright has three touchdowns-- -[Winfield] My goodness. {\an8}[Crowder] Yeah. 24-nothing. Attababy, attababy. [Winfield] This is an absolute track meet right now, but only one of the teams is participating. [Crowder] Johnson's back to pass. Pressure in his face. Fires it deep down the far sideline, has a man, caught, five-yard line. -Touchdown, EMCC! -[cheering] [Winfield] If we're even, I'm leavin'. -He left it. -[Buddy] Good job. [Crowder] Oh, man, what a beautiful throw. EMCC is up 31-nothing. -Hey, did I get some height on that? -[Wood] Yes, sir. [Buddy] Oh, my God! They are terrible! [Isaiah] That nigga in thug mode. He got the hat backwards. [Buddy] Hey, nothing but touchdowns. [Crowder] Wright's to the right of Johnson. He takes a snap, leaves it with Isaiah Wright. Looks around near side, trying to angle past-- -[whistle blows] -[coach yelling] [Wood] Come on! He's tackled here. [Winfield] Got a late hit on that play. Tackle out of bounds, but the flag did not come. [Buddy] Time out! God dang it! [Isaiah] That's bullshit, dog. Oh, no, no. You're wrong. Call... Hey, call the game, not because it's Delta but call the game -like you're supposed to. -I ain't worried. You are too because... Hey, hey. No, hey! Call it right! -Understand? I don't need nobody hurt. -Come on. -[Buddy] Talk to me straight! -[Isaiah] Coach Stephens... -Coach Stephens, come on. Come on. -[clamoring] [growling] {\an8}Referee, uh, I don't think they're paying too much attention right now. {\an8}They're trying to help him out. They feel sorry for him, but they're gonna probably feel sorry for him. They probably just callin' it like it is. [growling] That's a mad growl. [Crowder] Clock rolling in the second quarter. [Winfield] Gonna be an interesting decision here. Do you use a time out, force them to punt? [Buddy] Want me to call time out? [Wood] I want the ball if we can get the ball. [Crowder] Eerily similar to last year. [Buddy] Want me to call time out? [Wood] I do. I want you to call time out. I want the ball. [Buddy] Want me to call time out? [Wood] I would love for you to. [player] You can. -[Wood] I would call time out. -[Buddy] It's not against the rules. [Crowder] They'll turn and leave it with Haymon. Haymon bounces behind left tackle. Can he get up to the 49-yard line? -Ball's gonna come out! -[cheering] EMCC ball on the far sideline, inside the 25! Twenty, ten, five. Touchdown, EMCC! Oh, goodness! Picks up a fumble and marches some 50 yards down the field... -[Buddy] Good job. -[coach laughs] -[Winfield] You kidding? -[Isaiah] Hey... -[Crowder] No way that just happened. -[player] Yes, sir! That's gonna be a 50-yard sweeping score, {\an8}and EMCC will have a 45-7 lead at the half... {\an8}-[Winfield] And keep the time out. -[Crowder] Right. [Wood] You didn't need the time out. [Buddy] Didn't have to call time out. [Wood] You didn't call time out. [player] Hey, guys, we made to halftime. -[laughs] -[Buddy] Great job, D! Atta way to run around and smoke 'em in the head. Defense, offense get in the back room. You got a 26-minute halftime. We're going out with seven minutes left. We are gonna lathered up like a great horse does, and then we gonna keep whooping that ass. Let's go. Come on.

[Buddy] Hey! Hey! Everybody stay with me. Let's go, come on. Good job, guys. Right here. Hey, we're gonna stay right here. Stay right here. Right here. Let's go. Nice job, guys. Hey, hey, take... Grab a knee. My guys, grab a knee. Grab a knee, guys. Hey! Grab a knee! Grab a knee! Hey, Coach. -Good job. -Thank you. Thank you, man. [Crowder] And they're showing great sportsmanship now at midfield. Men from different teams putting arms around each other, and they're all bowing their heads and having prayer. Lord, again, we thank you for your love for us. We just thank you that you would send your son to die for each one of us. Yes, Lord. [Clark] Lord, we thank you that you've given us the ability to play this great game. -[coach] Yes, Lord. -[Clark] And Lord, we pray that we will continue to play for your glory. [coach] Fellas, the most important decision you can ever make in your life is to know Jesus. Football will pass away. Know him, in your heart. Proud of all of y'all. God bless you. Amen. -[all] Amen. -[Buddy] Hey! Our Father... [all] Who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as in Heaven. Give us today our daily bread... Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. [Buddy] We went to church like every... Like, like other people because that's what we thought we were supposed to do and... Mainly it was, you know, me and my brother, we'd go to church, ride the church bus, on Sundays. I don't ever remember going to church as a family. I don't think that happened many times. Were the apostles appointed or... did the apostles see Jesus? Was that something, that they saw Jesus and then followed Jesus? [Davis] We sat down and he just, pretty much, bared his soul, I guess. He said that he wanted to change. {\an8}One of the things I asked Buddy, if he knew the Lord. {\an8}After that is when Buddy got with his pastor and got all his things worked out with the Lord. We can do all the good deeds in the world, but until we... [stammers] until we recognize Jesus Christ as the son of God, all those good deeds don't matter. [Davis] I put my hand on his shoulder and I said, "Buddy, you need to understand that the devil sure would like for you to just completely blow up and go old school." It's easy to get out of living for the Lord. Uh, just because you let him in doesn't mean you're going to change and stay changed. [stammers] But I just... I think Buddy's come this far, I'd really be disappointed if he doesn't ride this thing out. And, uh, there's gonna be a new Buddy Stephens. {\an8}I was talking to someone and, um, she was like, "Wait, your dad's the coach? {\an8}He is a bad dude." {\an8}I was like... "Well, that's, you know, not hurtful." [laughs] {\an8}Like, okay. I think he's definitely dealing with 51 years of not following Christ. Like, when you live that long and establish your roots, of course you're gonna be wrestling with it. And so, we're not gonna instantly become what we want to be. And we're not instantly going to be this super Christian or anything. He's just like anybody else. He makes mistakes. Just because he has a camera on him and a bunch of people looking to see what he does next, doesn't mean he's not human. And so, he's gonna make those mistakes, so... [Buddy] We talked about all of us trying to do better at... at all of our stuff. Me, especially with my language, I try to do better and I... I know that there's people here going through the same struggle... whether it be as a football player or whether it be as a Christian [stutters] or whether it be as a student. Whether it be as a son or a brother. I think we all... Everybody out here wants to do good. Everybody out here wants to be good. Okay? But, like me, you gotta make that promise to myself and to you and to my God. Iron sharpens iron. When you see your teammates stepping out of line, whether it be out here on the field, in the classroom, in the dorm, check him, okay? Check him. You see me stepping out of line, check. "See, Coach..." -[players laughing] -[chuckles] All right. [stammering] I brought that one on myself. All right. I'm a maker of my own misery. Keep your team in your prayers, all right? Reeve, lead us. [all] Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... [Dakota] Hey, what's going on, Coach? {\an8}Season's good. We're preparing for Holmes this week, so... {\an8}We got a pretty good run-stop defense, so we should be... {\an8}We should be able to handle them. I've been playing the game for so long, you know. I just feel like I have a high IQ of, like, where the ball is gonna be. [spits] Yeah... yeah, yeah. Instinctive. Yeah, yeah, that's the word. Yeah, really, I'm just looking for a... for a place that's just willing to give me a second chance, to be honest, you know. [Wood] Hey, man. There's a bunch of ham and sandwich stuff in here. Y'all gonna come get one. Glad you're here. Love it. All right. What we talk about every week. Don't accept anything I say. {\an8}You gotta look it up. Go back and find it. {\an8}Prove it. It's gotta be something that comes from that Bible. {\an8}We talk about it all the time. Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. So, I gotta make sure I understand we're here to talk about the Bible, nothing else. Last week, we talked about the enemy being who? -[players] The devil. -The devil. And we talked about the fact that he prowls around like a roaring lion. So, we're aware that he's out there. Genesis 39... Who wants to read that? Anybody? I got it. "She grabbed him by the garment and said, 'Sleep with me.' But leave... But leaving his garment in her hand, he escaped and ran outside." [player sighs] [coach] That's pretty tough. [stammering] I understand. I mean, I was you all's age. I'm a young man now. You know, when a woman comes at you like that, how many of us can sit there and say, "No. No, thank you. I ain't about that"? You know what I mean? That's not the easiest thing to do. Well, like you said, like, God allowed Joseph to have everything. Wouldn't it be easier to say no to temptation if you just had everything? [Wood] Yes. Is it easier if I have, to say, "Well, I don't have to do this"? Sure. If I'm a guy that's hungry and I'm out on the street and I hadn't eaten a meal in days, how easy would it be for me to say, "I'm gonna steal to eat." But at the end of the day, that's still a choice I have to make. [Dakota] I grew up in a nice home. My father and my mother really cared about me. After everything at Texas Tech, they were disappointed. And, you know, I don't blame them for that, you know. [stutters] I understand, you know, I messed up. People make mistakes every day, so... [Wood] The temptation was there. I had to learn endure stuff. [Dakota] After everything that happened, I was getting phone calls from... from, really, everybody. I mean, family members, not-family members, people who were just being nosy, wanted to know. And one thing a lot of 'em had in common was they always said just pray about it, you know, God has a plan for you, just keep praying. And so, then I started to pray, every day. Just prayed every day and then just slowly and surely, miracles started to happen, like my case got dropped and not even a day later, East Mississippi offers me a scholarship to come play football again. Something I love to do, so... I mean, that's what really made me... Made me find faith in Christ. How many y'all saw guys that you played that you may have been better than? Or you played over? And they would still get offers and sometimes you didn't get offers. Sometimes you're getting discouraged about the recruiting process. You got different things going on in your mind. But what you gotta realize is, it's gonna happen in due time, when it's supposed to happen. And I may have a dream of playing at such and such, but I may not be meant to play at such and such. I may be more destined to play over here instead of here. [exhales] I like that. [Wood] And what a powerful deal that is. All for maybe a detour. You're in Texas, and then you're here. And something big's gonna happen for you. But you had to detour here. Now, that wasn't the original plan, that doesn't mean my road has to end. Just means I got to take another path to get back to where I need to get to. [Jay] That bible class though. Well needed, man. It's needed. {\an8}I ain't living no perfect life. You ain't living no perfect life. {\an8}[player] Nobody perfect, man. We ain't living no perfect life. -High school, bro, I was bad. -[player] I already know... I got a homeboy raisin' up, a close cousin raisin' up... Every time you seen him, you seen me. But... but he doing... He doing time in jail right now. I know I probably be right there with him. [stutters] I wasn't supposed to be in school right now, period. I'm supposed to be back home, on the street, doing what everybody else is doing because so many people doubted me. By my 11th-grade year, bro, I realized that, you know, maybe it's time for me to, you know, you know... [player] Get right. You know, get my life back. I got a scholarship. I ain't never thought I was gonna get that. I wasn't livin' right. And to this day, I still wonder why is he still blessing me? [Dakota] You got a purpose. It's wild. It's a purpose. It's a purpose. I don't know my purpose yet. You got it. He gonna show you, bro. Purpose, he gonna show you that. I don't know my purpose yet. He gonna show... Bro, I... Listen, bro. -I'm ready for it. -He gonna show you the purpose. You just gotta stay with him, bro. I'm telling you, bro. [stutters] I'm still trying to find what my purpose is. Just how we talking right now, bro. Talk to him, bro. Don't beat around the bush. Talk to him. Just how we're talking now. Hey, I'm gonna pray for y'all, man. For sure. [player] Hey, I got you too, my boy. All right. [indistinct chatter] {\an8}What about Dakota, 40? {\an8}Gotta have him. As far as carries. [Freeze] So, you would rank the, uh, backers, definitely take Dakota. [Collins] Absolutely. He's a baller. [Buddy] Hey, the kid that I really think's the, maybe, the sleeper out of all of 'em is Isaiah Wright. The running back. That's the running back receiver. The kid that was on ESPN leaving from the five-yard line and... -You know, you saw that one? Four. -What number? [Isaiah exclaims] [player] One more! One more. Keep going. He got me fucked up. He ain't figured out his shit. [Isaiah yells] Yeah! [Buddy] Brother signed with Indiana last year. He's just a phenomenal athlete. Florida State and uh, Auburn have offered. He's the one that I think's... [Freeze] Mid-year? [Buddy] Yes. He's the one I think is special. He's just... He's the best athlete on the field when he's on the field. I'm just telling. [radio host] Isaiah, it's been weeks since you've been out there a whole game. How good was it to be back? [Isaiah over radio] Yeah. I felt amazing to be back. I'm glad to come back. Help my boys come out with another win. It feels good to be back. [host] You've been banged up last couple of weeks. How do you feel now? [Isaiah] Oh, I feel like after a football game. It's... I feel relieved. -[host] Relieved? -[Isaiah] Relieved. Yeah, ready to go. Relieved. [host] Good. We'll be ready to see you next week. -[Isaiah] Thank you. -Good to see ya. All right, that was Isaiah Wright, uh, outstanding effort tonight. Three touchdowns... [Isaiah] I ain't vote this shit. I ain't 'bout to vote for none of them motherfuckers. -Donald ass wanna send us back. -[player] Aye. Hillary don't know what the fuck she doing. I mean... [player] Lemme tell you. If I was to vote, I'd vote for, uh... What that nigga name? Sanders, y'all. Sanders! Yeah! I'd vote for Sanders. [player] You could vote for him. You gotta check "other." -Check "other" and put Sanders. -[player] Write his name. Let's see. [Isaiah] Let me show you what I'm about to get. [man] You getting that? Yeah. You see I'm getting that. She getting the other. [man] Ooh! [Isaiah] What up with it, boy? [man] When I get done with everybody's tats tonight, they gonna be sleeping good. -[Isaiah chuckles] -[man] Yeah! [Jazlyn] I mean, I just woke up and I was sick. And I sat there and looked at my calendar and I was like, "Oh, look at that." I was like, "All this stuff is adding up." [tattoo machine whirring] [Jazlyn] He was like, "You think I'm gonna be a good dad?" And I'm like, "Yeah, you gonna be a good dad. You don't have anything to worry about." [Isaiah] I mean, yeah, but I mean, I want a child. I mean, I just feel like I love kids. I feel like I'm... I'll be a great father, to be honest. [Jazlyn] We panicked at the beginning. But, after that, like, everything I needed, he found a way to get it to me. He was like, "Yeah, I'm young." But, he was, like, "It's here." He's like, "Whether I'm happy or not, I kinda have no choice but to be happy about it. Like, it's gonna be mine." He, like, changed his whole mindset. "I gotta do better." He's like, "I know what I have to do and I know I gotta do it." [tattoo machine whirring] He's like, "I'm preparing myself." And I said, "I'm preparing myself, too." So, we can be the best that we can be. We got to. -[man] "One life, one love." -[Isaiah] She got the "One love." [Jazlyn] Love. -[man] So, is this your first tattoo? -[Jazlyn] Hmm. [man] You nervous? [Jazlyn] And I think it's because of all of that that he's been through, he's like, "I can give the love that I didn't get." That's what he told me. "I can give the love that I didn't get." -[man] Here? -[Isaiah] Letters first. -[man] Letter, yeah. -Why we doing the letters first? [Isaiah] 'Cause that's the hardest. Gonna get that done, -'cause that's close to the bone. -[Jazlyn] No, I don't wanna get it. [tattoo machine whirring] [man] You gonna listen? [whirring intensifies] [grunts] Okay. Now that part hurt. When he started, yeah, it hurt. [Jazlyn] He calls me every day. He makes sure I eat right. He makes sure I get what I need. Yeah, it's gonna be hard, but he's there. [Isaiah] Shit, I mean, I been through six years of foster care. I done lived by myself. Six of us with one egg and two bags of oatmeal. So, I mean, the struggle since birth... I mean, we can handle it. [indistinct chatter] Ready, stretch. Where would you rather be than on the field at East Mississippi Community College? Can't think of a better place. All day long, 24 hours a day. You can break up with your girlfriend, get a new girlfriend. Get two girlfriends. You gotta love playing East Mississippi football. It's what we do. We get an opportunity to do what we do and do what we love now. We gonna have a great practice. Not a good practice. Do I have great expectations for tomorrow night? Yes. Do I expect to set records at East Mississippi in a positive way? Yes. Do I expect our guys to fly around the football? Yes. But is it another challenge? Absolutely. What's troubling about Holmes is they have a different offense than we're used to. Three guys can carry the ball at any given time. And they also can throw the ball. Big game Thursday night now. Gotta take it on the road. [Williams] This is gonna be an ugly game tomorrow night. All because of what they do. It's a frustrating game to coach against. Because of what they do. But we got you guys ready. All the fakes, all the motions, all the tricks that they do. This is a big deal. Pay attention. Pay attention. [Williams] You number five in the country, but you're number one in our minds. When we recruited you, you are a number one football team. You're the number one defensive line in the state and in the country. We need y'all to play like that tomorrow night. [Ed Holly clapping] Remember, you are the chosen one, baby. You are the chosen one! We feel we're the best rushing defense in the country. And they're the best rushing offense in the state. So, it's gonna be a battle of Titans, Thursday night. [sizzling] [Crowder] Good evening and welcome to Ras Branch Stadium on the campus of Holmes Community College. It's a top 20 battle tonight {\an8}between number 5, EMCC, and number 16, Holmes, {\an8}with that get-down-the-field offense and of course, that triple-option attack. [Winfield] EMCC, no margin of error if they want to work their way up the polls. Love to add another resume win. [Buddy] This thing's gonna be won by the bunch that's... That wants to be most disciplined. You're more athletic. You're a better football team. You're better football players than they are. -You gotta want it more. -[player] Yes, sir. Hey. You gotta go out, lay an ass-whooping on them. That's it. Go out there and bust their ass now. Punch 'em in the mouth and let's get after it. Everybody, grab a knee, everybody touch somebody. [player yells] [Crowder] Here's the snap at the knees to Johnson. He's looking near side, throws it left has a man, caught by Lanier. Touchdown, EMCC from 27 yards out. And the Lions score first. [coach] Let's go, baby! Let's rock and roll. Let's go! They cannot hang with us. There is no way. [Crowder] Let's see what Holmes can do. [Winfield] Question is going to be, can that Lion defense obey its assignments, not try to be the hero, make the plays it's supposed to make... [Crowder] Here's the snap. They fake the pitch near side, throw it down the middle, wide open receiver -caught at the 40. -[Buddy] Get it down! Get it down! Jeez! [Crowder] Touchdown, D.J. Montgomery! [Winfield] Well,  it's a rushing offense by design, but the thing is, when you get worried about the run... -[Buddy] That's horse crap! -it leaves guys open in the middle of the field. Hey, let's go! We gotta stop that shit. Get on the sidelines. [Winfield] So far, defense only a vague rumor here in Goodman. -[Buddy] Hey! -[Ed Holly] It's not gonna happen again. -Let's go. We understand this. -[Buddy] Hey... I told you, "Discipline, discipline." [Crowder] Both teams with a lot of offense as EMCC is gonna go three-wide here to the near side. [player] West, west motion. [Crowder] Johnson's gonna be in the shotgun. Here's a fade pattern near side looking for Willis. Willis is gonna catch it over his shoulder. Touchdown, EMCC! [Ed Holly] Now, let's go! [Winfield] That looked like a throw you make in your backyard. -[Trickett] Attaboy, attaboy! -[Ed Holly] Let's go! [Crowder] Twenty-six yard touchdown receptions and EMCC has jumped back out on top. Let's see what that defensive front can do. [Winfield] Do we have to say it again? Let's play assignment football here on defense. [Crowder] They'll hand it off to that D-back, he's gonna go up the gut. -At the 5, dives to the goal line. -[stadium announcer] Touchdown! -[coach] Come on. -[Ed Holly] Fuck! What the fuck? [stadium announcer 2] Sixteen-yard touchdown run. [Crowder] EMCC is going to give up the touchdown. Both teams have scored on both possessions. [Winfield] Glen, it's got the feel of an old Mountain West game here right now. [Ed Holly] They runnin' through us like shit through a goose. [Winfield] This one's gonna be 62-61, if we're not careful. -They're bombin' that bitch on our ass. -[chuckles] We, God damn, out there lookin' like some bums tonight. Shit's crazy. Then they out there thinkin' they fire as a motherfucker. [Buddy] Hey! Now go! I'm telling you now, damn it! They'd better play. [Ed Holly] We have to do something. Hey, linebackers! Right here! So the end, so who's blocking the end, if he comes and blocks us? The end is squeezing. I guess, he's squeezing too hard, Coach. All right, let's tell him not to squeeze that hard. Fuck, I don't know. -Get down! Get down! -[De'Andre] Thirty-three! [Crowder] EMCC looking to go ahead by a touchdown. Johnson takes it left side, gonna dive for the goal line. Touchdown, EMCC! And Johnson has put EMCC up by a touchdown. It is 21-14. [Winfield] De'Andre Johnson looking really, really good here in this first quarter. [Ed Holly] Next play. Next play! Next play! [De'Andre] We've been through this. We'll get around it. Another shootout. Another shootout, Jay. -[Buddy] Ed... -You're right. -[stammers] I can't do this, man. -You're right. Hey, listen. Listen to me. [stadium announcer 2] Twenty-seven, first and ten. Listen to me. When we... Listen to me. Don't get blocked on the edge. -Let's go. -[player] Sir, we playing-- [Ed Holly] Just get the fucking signal, 404. Jesus Christ! [Winfield] The last team with the ball to score wins the game. At least that's how it's setting up. [Crowder] Here's the snap by Bryant. He's back to pass. Rolls to his right, fires it back corner, end zone, right side. Caught. And that's gonna be another Holmes touchdown. For crying out loud! How the fuck, dude? Oh, my fucking God. Tim? What are you doing? God damn! What are you doing? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, come here. [Ed Holly] We got it. We got it. [Buddy] Will you quit making their ass look silly as shit and find something that fucking works? You understand? Making our ass look silly as shit. [Winfield] Well, Buddy Stephens out with his palms to the sky which means he wants an explanation. [chuckles] You gotta be fucking kidding me. You gotta be fucking kidding me. [clapping rapidly] Play your butt off. Want it more than they do. Let's go! Play your butt off. [Winfield] We have a tie football game. 28-28. Neither offense has left the field without a touchdown. [Crowder] Isaiah Wright out there, tailback. De'Andre Johnson is back out of quarterback trip receivers left side. Gonna leave it in the belly of Wright. He's got a big lane inside the 20, and he's gonna get inside the ten, five, touchdown! He goes untouched. Oh, goodness, 48 yards. -[Trickett] Whoo! That boy fast. -[coach] Go score! Yes! Whoo! That boy fast. {\an8}[Crowder] And it will be a 35-28 game here at halftime. [Winfield] They need some adjustments defensively in the second half. [Buddy] Everybody in the back can hear. Let's go. Excuse me. Excuse me. [player] Watch out! Here's the bottom line. Okay? We got some front-running sumbitches in here now. You either better goddamn get up off your ass and let's go or let's get out. Defense, there's no reason they run and dive for three yards with guys we wouldn't sign as damn practice players. You better pull something out of your rear end in the second half and make a stop on that first series and do what you're supposed to do. Or I swear to God... you will be running till you can't see straight. I promise you, I promise you... we will have a hell of a weekend. You think I'm joking, try me! [Ed Holly] So far, we haven't held up the defensive bargain in this game. And we know it, you know it and I know it. And I love coaching you guys. I love it, but if I'm gonna continue to be here, you gotta help me out now. We need to turn this tide around. [Winfield] Buddy Stephens. He had a problem with their assignment defense but we're gonna see  what they were able to get fixed. You really wanna get a stop out of the dressing room. Or if not, you got a tie ballgame all over again. -[Ed Holly] Get outside. -[Buddy] Outside! Go! [Crowder] There's the pitch on the outside and getting out across the 40, 45, and into EMCC territory. And they can't tackle him but it seemed like he was getting a white shirt escort at times. They were around him but just couldn't get him down. Await the snap. He's gonna take it, toss it, uh, to the left side and going in untouched {\an8}as he walks to the goal line. And Holmes has closed the gap. {\an8}[Winfield] You know, sometimes, I listen to Coach Buddy Stephens {\an8}and I think, "That's a little much. That's harsh." But, boy, EMCC probably needed it. -[Wood] Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. -[player shouting indistinctly] [Ed Holly] Physically dominate him. Let's go. [Crowder] Play action. Firing it over the middle, has a man wide open. Caught! Goal-line touchdown! -EMCC, Calvin Keys. -[cheering] {\an8}-Yes, sir! Yes, sir! -Yeah! There we go! {\an8}Love that. Love that. I fucking love it! [Wood] Hey! How you like that? How do you like that? -[De'Andre] I like that! -[Williams] Come on. Don't fall asleep! [Crowder] Dobbs will take the snap. Leave it with his, uh, tailback who's gonna go up the middle, and he is going to go untouched. 30, 25, 10-yard line, 5-yard line. And that's gonna be another Holmes touchdown. {\an8}Holmes is gonna tie this one up with a PAT. {\an8}-Aw, shit! -Come on, people! Play the damn hole! -[Buddy] Hey. God damn it. -[Ed Holly yells] [Crowder] That big play is hurting EMCC. Hey. Get this shit fixed! I got to get back. I got to get outta the way. Or else I'm gonna say something to Ed that's crazy. Go find something else to film right now. I'm getting kinda fed up with this shit. [Crowder] They kick it. Retaken by the Lions at the ten. Number four, Isaiah Wright, 20, 25 and a big lane out across the 40. Across midfield, -and 15, 10, 5, touchdown, EMCC! -[cheering] {\an8}That's Isaiah Wright. {\an8}[growls] [man] He's a good football player, right there. Who gets that credit? Yeah, you? -[Isaiah and Wood laugh] -[Wood] Good job. [Crowder] Let's see what that defensive front can do. Fourth down and seven. [Winfield] You have to be thinking, if you're Holmes by going for it, boy, you don't want to give EMCC a chance to get the ball back and go up two scores. [Crowder] Takes a snap, back to pass. Looking. It's backside pressure, gonna be hit. Dropped back at the 36-yard line. Coming up with the sack is gonna be Dakota Allen. [Winfield] Nice tackle by Dakota Allen. [Crowder] Leading tackler on this EMCC team. [Winfield] Now is the time you need to get yourself some separation. Take advantage of  that defensive stop that you got. [Crowder] The snap. Johnson comes around left side. Gets to the 5. Stays on his feet. -Goes to the goal line. Touchdown! -[Buddy] Attababy! [Winfield] EMCC continues to roll their offense. [Crowder] And EMCC's gonna hold on to win. And, boy, this was a shootout. [Winfield] 63-42. No, that is not a basketball score. This is Thursday night football. [Crowder] Holmes has 40 seconds to go in this game and they're trying to get into the end zone. [Buddy] Hey. They better not score again. That's ridiculous. [Crowder] You've heard the song that never ends? This is the game that never ends. Bryant pitches it late. Holmes scores again. [Buddy] Nobody out there. Nobody out there. Nobody out there. -Nobody out there. -[Ed Holly] We're sitting on man coverage. [Crowder] And that's gonna end this game. [Buddy] Here you go. Y'all take my stuff. [marching band playing] I'mma let y'all be damn head coaches. [Crowder] The marathon is over. 63-49. And I know they wanna... fix some things. Defensively, they did a better job in the second half. ♪ Accept my prayer ♪ [Pastor Moore] If I'm going to have a happy life, I gotta walk not in the counsel -of the ungodly. -[woman] All right!
