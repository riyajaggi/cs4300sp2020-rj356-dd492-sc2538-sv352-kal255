 [DJ] If I could do something different, I'd come back to high school, man. I mean, I had a whole bunch of Division I offers. So, if I would've came to class instead of skipping class... {\an8}nothing would have stopped me then, but... {\an8}I messed up. I dug a hole. {\an8}Gotta climb out of it. Ain't how you fall, it's how you get up, man. Ain't how you fall, it's how you get up, you know? You can't change the past. [chuckles] [Daniel] Brings back a lot of memories, man.

 Lot of good games played on this field out here. -Lot of real good games. -That's when the game was live, though, when I was a little boy. Everybody was out here. The whole hood was out here, then. I'm talking about the whole hood was out here. Everybody. [Daniel] This where it went down at. Right here, man. [DJ] A hundred touchdowns, ran on this field. [Daniel] You only get one shot at life, man. [stutters] Ain't no rewinding back time. Ain't no do-overs. You get one shot at it, man. It's about the choices you make. You're makin' the right ones, son. [marching band playing] [music playing on car stereo]

 [DJ] This right here is Martin Luther King Jr. street. This street has been the most famous street growing up, you know? I mean, everything went down on this street. Every Friday night... I heard gunshots, seen people pull out guns, shoot. I mean... And I'm walking the same street every day. [Napoleon Harris] Majority of the young men that stay in this community, that don't go off to college or to the military, some way, they end up in the penal system. {\an8}There are so many young, young men that had an opportunity {\an8}to make it out of, uh, Haines City. {\an8}Shykeem Pitts. {\an8}Very talented young man. Very, very respectful. But got into an incident that stopped him from going to Marshall University. So being that that was a problem, he moved back home. And when he moved back home, he became one of the guys on the corner. And being that he became one of the guys on the corner, he met fate, and fate being death. [DJ] He was a big legend around here, you know. Everybody respected him. Everybody loved him. The guy was funny, great, loving. Cared for anybody, man. Would do anything for anybody, man. He was a great guy. {\an8}Great football player. {\an8}Somebody I always looked up to. {\an8}I seen him do moves in Little League {\an8}that, man, I've been copying since his days, {\an8}like me jumping over people. {\an8}That ain't coming from me first. It came from Shykeem. {\an8}I've seen him jump over a guy in Little League and I just thought, "Man, that guy..." [exhales] And now, ever since then, I've just been looking up to that guy. Looking up to that guy and then... For him to like... [stutters] He's gone. At a early age, you know. I took it kinda hard because, you know, that's somebody I looked up to. And just... It just made me realize that life is real, you know. It just showed me life is real and there's something I gotta do. Something I gotta do. Football is something I gotta do to get up out... get up out of here. This my home, but it's something I gotta do. [Wagner] Y'all are fixin' to have to get out when DJ gets in here, so you better hurry up and finish. 'Cause you don't wanna hear what I'm about to say. [player 1] I'mma laugh. [player 2] I wanna hear it. [Wagner] I think he has me blocked. 'Cause when I call, it goes straight to voicemail. When Kate calls him, it rings. [player 1] You're not gonna find him, bro. If his phone's going to voicemail, it's over with. [player 2 chuckles] [Wagner] DJ, come in here. I have to talk to you about your academics. Period. [DJ] We'll talk later. No. We're not talking later. We're talking now. [DJ] Then send me home. DJ. Come on. [DJ] Leave me alone. Fuck this shit. [Wagner] What are you talking about? Come in my office. Stop. There's no reason, come on. Come on. No reason. All right, look. This is the last grade report I got. Look at me. This is a very real situation that we have to figure out how to deal with. You cannot run from this. If you run and you quit... what are you gonna do? Think about it. Where are you gonna go? Are you afraid of putting forth effort and then still failing? Something like that. Have you tried to put forth effort? I mean, honestly, like, the other day, when you were typing the English essay in there with Miss-- When we had you in the computer lab and you were typing the essay, did you try that day? [DJ sighs] I think you tried. Didn't you? [DJ] Why do you say that? [Wagner] Because it was a good essay. I think when you try... it scares you a little bit. Because then you're gonna get your hopes up. [cell phone beeps and vibrates] That maybe you can do it. And then when you get your hopes up... and you're excited about it, and you're excited about the possibility, what happens if you're disappointed? And you don't think you can handle that. You don't think you can handle that disappointment. So the alternative to that is, "Well, I just won't try. And then I just know I won't make it and then I won't be disappointed." -[sighs] -Is that what we're doin'? Am I right? [chuckles] Something like that. DJ, you have to care. [DJ] Everybody loves Miss Wagner. It's pretty much like a big family and she's like the mother. She also cares a lot, you know. But, at the same time, you can't tell if somebody cares about you, if they really care. I know football is a business. It's their job to have me stay here. [stutters] I don't know if they really care or not, but it's a game you have to play to get where you wanna go. Number one stress on my mind is making it. Making it to the league and making it in life. It came in high school. "Okay, man, you can make it to the NFL, you can make it to the--" I'm like, "Okay." I ain't take it serious, but after a while, enough people were telling me the same thing. "You can make it to the NFL. You can make it to the NFL." I mean, people say that all the time from back home. It puts a lot of pressure on me 'cause, like, if I quit, then I know I go back home. Everybody, everybody... talking, talk, talk, talk. Mmm-mmm. [Wood] Then he promoted Mordecai into that same seat. Mordecai then sends out a decree that saved all the Jewish people. Point to the story is this. How do you know you're not here for such a time as this? How do you know you're not here for such a time as this? What's my job here? Don't know. Maybe my job is to talk to you a little bit every week about the Bible. Maybe my job is to try to set a good example for you. Maybe my job's more than just calling plays. Maybe your job's more than just coming to football practice. Maybe it's a lot of going to class and doing other things as well. But how do you know that you weren't called here for such a time as this? We have a chance, right now, this week, to play for our seventh North Division title. That's how big this game is. It's right in front of you to do what you want to do. It's right in front of you to accomplish the goals that you came here to accomplish. You wanted to win championships? You're in a position to do that now. [Clifton Collins] This week, guys, {\an8}we got a good fucking football team coming in to whoop your ass. {\an8}They're ranked ahead of us. They undefeated. Probably gonna end up facing these guys somewhere again in a championship. [Williams] All your dreams that we had at the beginning of the season can still possibly come true if you do your job. [Lesley] Big-time players make big-time plays in big-time games. That's just the way it is. And we'll have to make some plays. It's the best offense we've faced by far. Probably will be the best one you'll face. [Williams] Do y'all know if y'all win this game, you gonna host two games in the playoffs? Does that mean anything to y'all? -[player] Fuckin' right. -Okay. [player] Ain't gotta go nowhere. -[players laugh] -All right. You right. [Wyatt] Oh, yeah, can't wait for the game. That's the biggest game of the year. You know, we got a lot to prove. They, uh... Some people got 'em ranked number one and they talkin' a lot so it's gonna be a fun one. It's the kind you like to play. If we don't play really good, we'll get beat. They got one of the best running backs in the state. [Lesley] That's probably the best player overall in the league. It's you and him. We gotta make tackles, guys. Gotta make tackles. Against the toughest son of a bitch to tackle. He's fast as a motherfucker, too. They was trying to compare him to me last year. {\an8}Effort, guys. Effort. {\an8}We can't sit back and just think that it's gonna fall into our lap. We gotta go make it happen. [Collins] Guys, we gotta work. When we do that, guys, we're good. Come on. Come on, Ollie. Come on, Ollie. I need you to work. Come on. Come on. -Come on! All the way up. -[grunting] Come on, man. Stop bullshittin'. [Lesley] Gotta have 110% of everything you do this week. Okay, if you need extra motivation for this game, guys, this ain't the sport for you. -These are the ones you live for, okay? -[panting] These are the ones you ask for, these are the ones you want. [Collins] Take pride in it, guys. Give a shit about it. Care about it. If you do that, everything gonna be fine. But you gotta fucking care about it. [players chuckle] [Marcel] This is good shit by Ollie, right here, Coach. -Boom! -[Williams] Running to the ball, that's a good job. Good play right there, Ollie. Appreciate it, Coach. You're showing your hands, you're staying low, ball come in side to side, you shrug, release, and make a play. You can play this game, Ollie, but you gotta do it consistently. Ollie missed three games and for him, missing those three games, you know... of course, he would get a little frustrated 'cause he feel like time is running out on him. [stutters] He wanted to sign. He wanted to go Division I. Anytime you miss three games out of the nine-game season, there's not much for him out there. There's not... [stutters] That's three games that people are not able to evaluate you, you know. So we just try to reiterate to 'em, man, the best situation for them to do... [Lesley] Last set! [Williams] ...is stick it out, you know. And hopefully playing really, really well toward the last couple of ball games. [Wagner stuttering] Ollie, we are reading this story. [Ollie] I'm not. [Wagner] Yes, you are. You don't have class till 9:30. -It's 8:52. -Man, you know how long that story is? [Wagner] I'm gonna read it so fast, I'm gonna make it so interesting. I'll even do, like, voices. -Like voice-overs. -Please, please, please don't. -Like I do when I read to my child. -[chuckles] [Ollie] I say, we'll come back later or something. [CJ] When's the ceremony? [Wagner] December 11th. Classes end on Thursday, the ceremony is on-- -Ronald Ollie, get back in here. -[players chuckling] [player] No. -You too big to be sneaking off. -You're too big to be sneaking around. -[player] Can I go? -[players talking indistinctly] -You hit everybody. [laughing] -[players laughing] Boom! Boom! Boom! [Wagner] Jay, close the door. This will never happen. Close the door, please. Jay Johnson, stay. We're reading this story. -Give me that phone. -[Jay stuttering] [Wagner] Close the door. All right. He out. [Wagner] All right, we're ready? [reading] "Morning of June 27th was clear and sunny with fresh warmth of a full summer day. People of the village... " "Village," keyword. "...began to gather in the square. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after the men. They greeted one another, exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women standing by their husbands..." You know, our teachers are very aware of the importance of, you know, these guys passing and passing with the highest grade they can get and... I mean, they're aware of that. But nobody's giving it away. [chuckles] I don't want 'em to give it away. But they know, his teachers know that he's, you know, good and got opportunities and he's got an opportunity to better his life. [stammers] But at the end of the day, the part of you being on time and going and sitting there and halfway acting interested? That you can do. Anybody can do that. Anybody can do that. And you do that and you're setting yourself up for, you know, at least a chance. What three examples are you thinking about using for your irony pair? Oh, uh... I don't know. I had lost my other sheet, the one I had highlighted all the... All right, so just make yourself little notes. Irony. All right? What else did we talk about in class that was ironic? How should a husband feel toward his wife? [stammers] He shouldn't wanna lose or kill her or something. -Right. -Yeah. I mean, if somebody messes with your wife, when you get one... [chuckles] -Yeah. -...you'll try to protect her. -[Ollie mumbles] Yeah, right. -All right. So those are some of the ironies that we talked about in class. So... [Collins] All right, man. Mmm, shit, you gotta get your education, then reality'll set in. [players talking indistinctly] You ain't got that many years of football. Ain't nobody out here got no... [coach] Darnall. [coach] Like 20, at least 15 years. [player 1] I said 15, yeah. [player 2] Fifteen. [player 3] Fifteen, if you great. [player 4] If you great. That's, yeah, that's hall-of-fame status. [CJ] For the league... The average time in the league is like three years, bro. -Mmm-mmm, nah, it's less than that. -[CJ] Well, it was three years. It was, this last... It's, like, one-point... -A half a year. -[CJ] Oh. Year and a half. Lot of guys get a chance. That's the good thing about JUCO. [stutters] It can make you or break you. [Wood] There's my guy. I've been waiting on it. I can breathe. [Ollie] Coach Collins, listen. -I'm listening. -I love you, bro. -I love you, too. Now get in. -[grunts] Come on, Coach, don't just... [groans] I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. -You going in? You going in? -I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. -[Wood] Put him in there. -[Ollie grunting] [player] Ollie's gonna do a good job, huh? -All right, Ollie? There. -[groans] [Wood] Sit down in it, dog! [Collins] Ollie. [player] Go run a lap, then do it. Yeah, I'mma run a lap. Lemme go run a lap. Ollie, Ollie... No, we don't want you... We ran enough in the summers. Hell yeah, we did. -[Collins] Okay. Watch your mouth, okay? -[groaning] [Wood and players laughing] Oh, no. Coach Collins, Coach Collins, bro! [yelling] Coach Collins! [screaming] -[player 2] Hey, shut up, man. -[players laughing] [laughing] [laughing] [Buddy] I'm embarrassed. But when punches were thrown, -I should've done something else. -[indistinct yelling] And sometimes, I've found that I like to blow things up instead of trying to dismantle it. And instead of sitting back and trying to... assess the situation, I just blew up. And got mad. Um, everybody wants to... wants to change for good. I've done a lot of soul searching, a lot of praying. I've tried reading more. I've tried doing a little bit more of, uh, making sure that, um, I try to work on my temper, work on being calm, as you can see. And, um, I had an opportunity to read this quote. And it was by the Dalai Lama. "Don't let someone else's misbehavior affect your peace of mind." And that, to me, has meant a tremendous amount. [Wood] Guys, I'd like to introduce you to our new head coach, Coach Buddy Stephens. -He'll be taking over. -Thank you very much. Thank you. -[players cheering] -Thank you very much. Thank you. [Wood] Kind of mixed, kind of mixed. [Buddy] All right. All right. I am so proud of the way you've played the last two weeks, we're moving forward. But we're gonna move forward as a team now. From here on, this week on, we gotta all be in. Coleman, Tillman, Ollie, Andry, played your butt off. Played your butt off. The whole defensive line played well all night long. [stutters] I will win championships with guys like that. I will win championships with unselfish guys that have one goal in mind, that is to win a championship and to know that that championship will help them get the scholarships that they need. This team's a dominant-ass team now. This is a dominant team. We'll have all hands on board this week. -DJ's laying down the law again this week. -[players] Hey! [Buddy] You know what I'm saying? He's gonna lay down the law. And let me tell you something, when we just start doing our thing, they can't stop us. -[music playing over headphones] -[indistinct chatter] -You ready? -Hell yeah. Ready? -Am I? -Oof. My first year of Little League, bro, I had fractured my bone on my foot. I was out for six weeks. First play back, 60-yard touchdown. Sprayed on they ass. [chuckles] Sprayed. -That's too long, dawg. -Sprayed, man. Everybody keep sayin', first play. I don't know about first play. But I know I'm gonna spray some of mine. I'm gonna spray on some shit. You wearin' a knee brace? [Buddy] You got an opportunity tonight, to go out and shut a lot of people up. You understand? You go out and you do what we do and you play free, all right? You play relaxed, you play our football and you get after their rear-end, you understand? -[players] Yes, sir. -Our father... [all] Who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name... {\an8}[announcer 1] It's number four Northwest and number eight EMCC live from Scooba. {\an8}This is the EMCC Football Network. {\an8}[crowd cheering] {\an8}[marching band playing] [indistinct chatter] [Wood] I'mma go with Isaiah to start it off, now, okay? [announcer 1] The winner of this game is the winner of the North Division Championship. And here comes Wyatt Roberts and this EMCC offense out there. For the first play of this top ten battle, they hand it off to Isaiah Wright. Cuts back up the middle and Isaiah, free up-field... [Trickett] Cut it up. Go, baby. He's gone. Let's go. Get the fuck out of here. Let's go! Whoo! {\an8}[announcer 1] Inside the 30, 20, ten, five, touchdown. EMCC. 83-yard touchdown run for Isaiah Wright. He started left, cut back up the middle, and went up through it, and then made it all the way to the end zone. And Isaiah Wright, I don't believe was touched. [announcer 2] 88 yards... and he is gone at that point. {\an8}[announcer 1] 4:06 to go in the first quarter, {\an8}EMCC strikes blood first, 7-nothing is our score. Hey, how good does that shit feel when you watch your running back heading down the damn sideline? Huh? How good does that feel, huh? [Lesley] Move, make 'em work... get 'em tired, okay? And then when you get to three, punish his ass. You got me? [announcer 1] Minshew in the shotgun. He'll have Crawford standing behind him. So it's a snap wide to the right, but he takes it and hands it to Crawford. Crawford trying to go around the right side and he's gonna be dropped for a loss on the play. [announcer 2] This Lion defensive front looking really good in the early going. [crowd cheering] [announcer 1] EMCC dressed in all black. They'll get down on the football around the 44, second down and short. Snap. Law, near side. [Buddy] Work outside, work outside, work outside. Good. Come on, there we go. [announcer 1] He's gonna cut back down the field and he's gonna have a burst of speed. [Trickett] Oh, he's gone. -[chuckles] Let's go, bitches! -Boo-yah! [announcer 1] Touchdown. DJ Law will get in on the scoring action for EMCC, here in this first half. And here comes the yellow hankie. [player] Look at all that ass. [laughs] [referee] Unsportsmanlike conduct on number one, after the touchdown. -Hey! -Oh, he's fine. You can't do much. -Come here. Hey, come here, hey, hey, hey. -That's a bad ass-- [Buddy] DJ, DJ, DJ, come here. Look, listen to me, listen to me-- [Wood] Hey, good run! Listen to Coach! -Listen to Coach! -[Buddy] Hey, hell of a run. [DJ] Yes, sir. [Wood] First one back. First one back! Hell of a run. Congratulations. Congratulations, son. Hell of a run. Hey, hey, it's okay. [stutters] I'm okay. Hell of a run. [players laughing] What, I thought he was mad at me. Wait 'til you get back over here and dance with me. [DJ panting] Hey. It's touchdown. Fuck it! Touchdown. [Wood] That's okay. [Trickett] I'm fine with that. [Wood] Yeah, we're good. Take the good with the bad. That's a good. That's a real good good. I like scoring touchdowns. Real good good. [grunts] Hey yo, yo! Let's fuckin' go. [DJ] Stay up, boy. [John] What dance you did? -What dance did you do? -[boy] Hey! What'd you do? -[DJ] Hmm. -With the bad leg? [kid] What'd you do? [coach] No more Stanky Leg. [player 2] No Stanky Leg? You did it! [yells] He did it with the bad leg. We up 14-0 on number... what, four team, three team? They sorry, though. Yeah, they sorry, but, God damn, we up on they ass. [announcer 1] Wyatt Robert's at quarterback, we haven't seen John Franklin III here in the first half. He'll snap it from the 14. Fake the give to Horsley. Has pressure, comes near side, gonna keep it himself, -has blockers inside the ten. -[Wyatt grunts] [announcer 1] He's gonna fall inside the five, stay on his feet... Touchdown! [Trickett yelling] That a boy, Wyatt! [laughing] [crowd cheering] [Trickett] He just rammed that motherfucker over. Whoo! {\an8}[announcer 2] Roberts' a guy who has been underestimated his entire career. That shit, damn! Good shit. [announcer 2] Nobody gives him credit as a running quarterback. And if you look at this, he's hit at the seven, drags through a defender and dives his way into the end zone. [announcer 1] Well, it's extended EMCC's lead to 28-9... [player] Ooh, real. [Wyatt] Hey, good job, baby. Good block, good block. [announcer 1] Northwest hasn't shown any signs of giving up either, down 28-9 with three to go here in the first half. [Lesley] Come on down, Powell! Widen out, Ryan! [announcer 1] Ball left hash, down to the ten, third down and goal to go. Play action, rolls near side. Ball! Shit. [announcer 1] Goes back left, has Crawford. Caught at the 3-yard line, dives for the end zone. Touchdown. So it's 28-16, 12-point lead for EMCC. [crowd chanting] Here we go, Lions. Here we go. [announcer 1] With 8,6 seconds remaining here before half. [announcer 2] Here goes. Try to throw one into the end zone. [Buddy] Go for it, right here. Go for it. Oh, John's in at wideout now. [Wood] I don't care what you do, if you got a good pass play, take it. If you use your legs, take it. Do what you do. [Trickett] You got a play, Coach? -Do that with John. -[Wood] Here we go. -Thirty-eight double. Thirty-eight double. -[Trickett] Oh, shit. Oh, shit. This ain't gonna work, is it? -Please work. -[Wood] You hear me, Buddy, 38 double. [announcer 1] Roberts, once again empty backfield. Man in motion, Sammy Burroughs from near side to far, and they flip it on the reverse and firing it is John Franklin III, deep down the field... that's a man in the end zone... -off the fingertips of Mario Lanier. -[cheers] Oh, my goodness. [announcer 1] Oh, that would've been beautiful. Ah, halftime. Halftime, let's go! -[John] Fuck! -Halftime, let's go. Halftime, let's go. Halftime, let's go. Halftime, let's go. Halftime, let's go. Get inside! [announcer 1] Well, that's a great play call. Because you got two quarterbacks out there on the field and, oh, that would have been beautiful. [Buddy] Goddamn John. Why does he throw the damn ball so fucking long? He was open from the goddamn 20 on. And he just fucking rears back and hums it. Great throw. Throw it a little bit earlier. Little bit earlier. Throw it a little bit earlier. Hey, you laid it out there way too far now, okay? -[John] I heard you. I heard you. -Hey. [John] I heard you. [stutters] Go sit down over there. I ain't playin' that, "I heard you, I heard you" shit. You understand me? I ain't playin' none of that bullshit. Hey. [player] It's good, man. Come on, man. Shit. You understand? 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, you take your shit and go to the house. Now. I ain't putting up with none of that bullshit. You take goddamn coachin' and you-- Hey, you should have thrown it earlier, that's it. Bottom line. You should have caught the damn ball. [DJ] Let's go, boys. [indistinct chatter] J-five, get your head out that locker. Players fuck up. [player] Hey, maybe we gonna fuck up, bro. [Ollie] Players fuck up. [player] Gonna take all 55 of us, bro. [player] Stay with it, man, come on. Stay with it. [Wood] We got some guys that are beat up, some guys that are banged up, some guys that are movin' around, I don't care about all that. Great athletes make plays. I'm not worried about the rest of it. Running backs been playing great. Receivers been playing great, O-line's been playing great, quarterback's been playing great. So right now, I want this thing finished like it's a zero-to-zero ball game. Nothing's going on other than us lockin' in on 'em. Defense is gonna take the ball away early in the second half, we're gonna get the ball back, we're gonna punch it down their throat and make 'em understand what it feels like. They came into this thing, the number four ranked team in the nation. You came in the number eight ranked team in the nation. That in itself ought to piss you off. Then you get past the pissed off point and you realize all the tradition that you got, you realize all the things you got, you recognize these black uniforms you're sporting, you recognize all the greatness that you got in you, and you play this second half like you hadn't played before. You will take no pity on 'em. You'll utterly destroy 'em. You'll leave nothing to 'em. You'll beat 'em as fine as dust. [Buddy] Finish what you started now. Finish it. Finish it. [players] Yeah, man. Let's go. [Buddy] Finish it! [stadium announcer] He's taken down around the 28-yard line. [announcer 1] It's a 12-point game, folks. Just when you thought EMCC was about to blow the barn doors open, you look up, Northwest is still in it, 28-16. Crawford to the left of Minshew, who snaps it from the 29-yard line. Fires it underneath and it is... intercepted by EMCC. And it's Ollie! He goes around to the right, and he's up past the 40, stays on his feet down the far sideline, pushed out of bounds in Ranger territory. Oh, my goodness gracious! And we just talked about Ronald Ollie, and he gets an interception there, with 14:11 to go in the third quarter. [announcer 2] Wow, that was just awesome. The big boy with the interception. [Williams] Hey, let's go. Let's go, boys! [Ollie] Didn't I tell you I got you? Huh? -Didn't I tell you I got you? -I heard you, dog. I got your back. [players yelling indistinctly] -Hey, hey, good job. -Yeah! -Good job, hey. -I wasn't gonna miss the second one! Hey, hey, hey, hey, sit down, sit down. Get off your feet. Hey, come here, Ollie, come here and sit your-- [Ollie] Whoo! Whoo! In front of my fucking brother, man. That's what the fuck I'm talking about. The fuck, bro. [Williams] Hey, come on, sit down, man. Calm down, you exerting all your damn energy. [announcer 1] Boy, I'll tell you what, Ollie is just a force in the middle and boy, they can cause trouble. [announcer 1] Spotted the football on the 39-yard line of the Rangers. Roberts, plenty of time to pass and he's gonna stay on his feet. [Wood] Do it! Do it! Do it! [announcer 1] Bounces to the outside, right side now, fires it down the field as Staggers... caught! Fifteen, ten, five, touchdown, EMCC! Hold up! [announcer 1] And that's what happens when you have a quarterback that has... had as many carries as Wyatt Roberts has in this game. He's done it on scrambles, he's done it on designed runs. Snap by Minshew, inside hand-off, fumbles the football around the 16-yard line and EMCC says they have it and they do. EMCC has a first down, 3:00 to go from the 16-yard line. Attaboy, Ollie! [indistinct cheering] [announcer 2] Is that Ronald Ollie again? [announcer 1 chuckling] It is Ronald Ollie. He has had a whale of a third quarter. An interception and a fumble recovery. [announcer 2] Boy, Ronald Ollie is just an absolutely dominant defensive performer. I'm so proud of you. But just... just every game. And you'll dominate every game, as long as you play this game. You got me? Just play like that all the time, not just in the big game. Just make that habit and you'll name wherever you wanna go. -All right. Got you. -You got me? -Appreciate it. -Told you I had you, Coach. [announcer 1] It's all Lions here in Scooba, in this top ten battle. [Wood laughing] Get off me. Hey, good job! [announcer 1] Coach Stephens and the staff have hushed their critics tonight. -[roars] Let's go! -Let's fucking go! {\an8}[announcer 2] A big win against this team. {\an8}A lot of people expected this to be a really tight game, and East Mississippi's just dominated the contest. [cheering and laughing] [player] Good game, Coach. [stadium announcer] And for the fifth time in a row, your EMCC Lions are the MACJC North Division Champions. [Buddy] Good job, baby. Hell of a job. [chuckles] [Buddy] Yeah, that's the small ring, we got one ring down. Let's get some more. All right, everybody grab a knee. Hurry! Everybody grab a knee. I'm very, very proud of you, I'm very proud... Hey, I'm happy just to be back at a damn ball game. -All right? -[players] Yeah! [Buddy] So, hey, I'm proud of you, I'm proud of the way you... Hey. You gave them a nice ass-whippin', all right. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Great job. There's 1:30 curfew tonight. Don't come in past 1:30, all right? [player calls] Blood make the grass grow. [all responds] Kill! Kill! -Blood make the grass grow. -Kill! Kill! [chanting] What say now? What say now? Kill, kill, boom! [player] Somebody light this bitch up! [all] Shh. Boom! [indistinct cheering] [hip-hop music playing] I have heard all the beatin' and rumblin' and tumblin' and all. When y'all do these damn dance-offs. [cheering] For defense, I got CJ Reavis. On offense, it's gonna be DJ Law. [chanting] [hip-hop music playing] [cheering loudly] [whistle blowing] [cheering continues] [whistle blowing] [Buddy stuttering] In the back of that... In the back of that Gator right there, is ice cream sandwiches for everybody. -Y'all go get some. -[yelling] [Pellegrin] Northwest is a good team, and then to dominate them 49-16, I mean, that was huge for us. And so we jumped from eight to three, after defeating the number four team in the country, uh, convincingly. Everything just started falling East Mississippi's way to climb right back to the top. You're looking at a team that's third, trying to get into the top two to play for a National Championship. Finish your season off beating everybody in the state playoffs {\an8}and winning the state championship, {\an8}you're feeling optimistic that one of those top two teams {\an8}are gonna lose in theirs and you're gonna get right back to one or two. Always great to have, uh, an ice cream sandwich. You want one? [Marcel] I got an offer letter yesterday. Two of them. I have a lot of offers, small schools, like, FCS-- Why would you not, at this point, entertain all offers? {\an8}'Cause they would try to force their will on you. {\an8}Like, "Come to our school," like, "You have no other choice but to come to our school." -[Kevin West] What's up, big guy? -Hello, Coach. How you been? -Good, man. How are you, man? -I'm good. Real good. All right, this is the deal. I've talked to you before. -Yeah. -We like you a bunch. Uh, I think you can play for us. Biggest thing is this, you've got some work you gotta do academically. {\an8}'Cause end of the day, it's an institution of academics, {\an8}and end of the day, you gotta get that done {\an8}before you can even get on the field. -[Marcel] Right. -We're gonna get you a great education, you know, so at the end of the day, uh, there should be no doubt that Southeastern Louisiana loves you. Oh, yeah, no doubt. I know that for a fact. [Kevin] I've given you a date to come. You couldn't take the date to come. What else can I do but get you a date, like I've already done and you still haven't come. So, we've shown you we wanted you. So what do we gotta do to be the first ones in your life? What-- I say... I want my number. [Kevin] You want your number? [Marcel] Number was the biggest thing. Having a number, well, that's not a hard thing. -If you earn it, that ain't a hard thing. -Yeah. [Kevin] All right, you know, what else, what else? Is that it? Just your number? -We got cameras. -[clears throat] What's that? We got cameras. -[Kevin] I got you. -[both chuckle] Well, uh, if it's against the NCAA rules, we're not going to do it, -I can tell you that right now. -Right now, yeah. I can tell you that, that ain't gonna happen. Whether it's cameras or not, I mean, if it's against anything the NCAA says we're not supposed to do, I don't care if cameras are here or not, we're not gonna do it. We're gonna follow the NCAA rules at Southeastern Louisiana. -[Marcel] Yes, sir. -I can promise you that. ...and Davis. [sighs] That's been, like, three days. [inaudible] [Buddy] Great kids. The kinda kids you want your daughter to marry. Wyatt is... is a tremendous leader. -So you're playing guard right now? -Yes, sir. I'm guard. Okay. You playing center? Practice, he'll show up, game film, he'll show up. It's just attitude. Um... Gotcha. Yeah, I just wanted to put a face with some names though. All right, so you know, gotta give y'all a shout, hit you up on the phone or whatever, y'all know who it is. [recruiter] How tall are you? Well, I'm 6'1". All right. 6'2"? Yeah? Mmm-hmm. [recruiter 2] Is he legit 6'2"? [Williams] He's 6'2". You see right there with his hands, see how he's not moving-- Yeah, but he can move his feet though. He goes to class, you gotta drag his butt to class? Mmm-hmm. No, he goes to class. Six one and a half and 295. Two ninety-five. Both of y'all 295? He's not very strong. All right, I'll be honest with you, he's not very strong in his upper body. -What up, Coach? -What's up, baby? -How you doin'? -I'm doin' well. How are you? -You know how we feel about you. -Yes. And, uh, we really are excited about you and the possibilities, you know. -Yes, sir. -We hope it work out. DJ Law, is he gonna actually make it? A 2,5. [Wagner] It'll come down to that last grade being put in. You know, he has some family issues and-- -Like what? -Uh, just with his son. You know, baby mama just gettin' in his head kinda deal. I got you. They not getting along. All right, fellas. Y'all be good. [door creaking] [indistinct] I like that one. That one right there. [Wyatt] Okay, okay. UAB, really? [Wyatt] It's nothin'. That's like Ohio even sending me all this stuff for what? Killin' trees, man. Keep sending me this, I ain't goin' to your school. I go to school, and get an education over there. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] [player] North, north, north, north. [Buddy] Fling it, let's go. Get it off. Throw it. Atta baby. [music playing on stereo] [John] Right away, right away. South. South. [Buddy] You ever notice when J-five gets scared, he just, like, eases up off the ball? And the nose goes down. [Wyatt stuttering] Yeah, when he doubtin' it? [Buddy] Yeah. And when he's confident, he just unleashes it. Yeah, but... he's gotta get confident. [music continues] With his speed, he can be a quarterback just about anywhere he wanted to be, but he just... Everything with his feet, everything below his waist is... You know, you never know when it's-- where it's gonna go. -Yeah. -He's gotta get consistent with it. -Hey, J-five. -Yes, sir. [Buddy] I saw the arm action, you were like a pitcher that was trying to slow down his release, and the arm, everything was... [grunts] and then the arm kinda slowed down a little bit to... to guide the ball. To hell with that, throw that damn thing. -I got you. -[Buddy stuttering] Don't ever second guess that. -[John] All right. -Just throw the shit out of it. -[John] I got you. -Make them catch it. [John] Got ya. [John chuckles] [Wagner] Hey, J-five. You didn't even speak when you came in. What happened to your niceness and the hugs? Where's the game at on Thursday? [Wagner] Delta. It's so far, we always just whoop their ass. [Wagner clears throat] [John] How many hours away? [Wagner] Four. [John] What the fuck? [John sighs] [Wagner] I mean, he's... he's pissed. He didn't transfer from Florida State to here to sit on the bench, so... I just know that, like, when a transfer comes in, especially a quarterback like that, they expect to start right off the bat, and play and then go back to that level. I mean, that's just what we've done. You know, and John, it's a little bit different situation 'cause he's not playing and he doesn't have stats and he... I mean, and the season's almost over, so it's like... [grunts] you know, you're runnin' out of time. He should play Thursday. Hopefully, they will take Wyatt out and let him play at least the whole second half because we're gonna be annihilating this team. [John] Hey, 33, 33. [Wagner] He just wants to be out there and he said that Auburn was comin'. I mean, if he doesn't get to play, I just almost hope that they don't come, because it will absolutely crush that kid. That they're on the sidelines and he's not out there. [Lesley] Up field, slam it down that way. [Buddy] There you go. What? You're not gonna play when the biggest school come watch us play? You not gonna play when Auburn come? [John clicks tongue] Man, I gotta play. They coming to watch me, so I gotta play. Ain't no questions asked, I'm playing. [Buddy] Last ball game of the year. We're looking to, uh, finish strong. Go into a playoff game and, uh, try to work for a National Championship. Every year we play Mississippi Delta, there's always some type of, uh, there's some type of something that happens. Hey, your guy hit my guy ten yards over on the white. {\an8}[Buddy] I'm sorry. {\an8}Why, Buddy? You ran the damn score up blocking punts and onside-- That's all right. [indistinct bickering] [Buddy] Okay, all right, all right. Hey, no, no, no. I don't wanna hear it. That's right. Walk off. Yeah, we told the guys what to expect. We told them that, you know, this team has nothing to lose. People are gonna talk smack. People are gonna say things, they may even do things to try to get you outta your game. [Wood] When I score, I can't talk a lot of trash. When I make a big play, a big conversion, I can't take it away from us with doing something stupid. Like, you'll watch this first play and they're gonna cheap shot him across the field, you see his mouthpiece get knocked out and everything like that. You turn and say something to the guy and the referee is all over you. We're... we're marked now and believe me we're gonna be marked, and with the stuff that's going on and Coach Stephens' deal and all that kind of stuff, they're looking to try to get stuff so we gotta be ultra-clean in how we play it. I don't mean not be nasty. I don't-- I'm not saying that, you gotta play the game in a nasty manner, but I gotta be smart about what I do. You better come with an attitude and get ready to play, all right? Every single play you watch, they're chipping these guys at the very end of the play. The play might be over and they're still nudging 'em just to bully 'em. All right? 'Cause that's the way they play. They wanna come out here and beat the shit out of you. What are you gonna do about it? You're just gonna roll over? Come on, man. [Buddy] Don't let the little things get to you, okay? Is what's goin' on sometimes on a field fair? Hell no. There ain't fair. Life ain't fair. Football ain't fair, it ain't fair that you got all this talent and beating the hell outta people, that ain't fair. It ain't fair that some of you are here and not at the big-time... at a big-time school. Some of you will be, it's not fair that some of you won't get that chance. It's not fair that somebody has an injury or somebody doesn't have a chance to play in every game. That's not fair. Ain't no fair. There's just us going out there and beating the hell out of people. That's it. That's it. Don't worry about what happens. Don't worry about the little words. Just stay focused. It's game day, it's game day, it's game day! [indistinct chatter] {\an8}[player 1] It's on now. [player 2] That's right, man. {\an8}[player 3] It been on. {\an8}-Fuck all that dumb shit. -[player 4] Mmm-hmm. Y'all hit my man in the face. It gonna cost one of y'all, now I'm telling you, now. That's not sportsmanship, bro. -Come on. -I got him, I got him. Turn around, turn around and look the other way for me. [Buddy stutters] One of their wide receivers punched one of our managers. And laid him open. He's in there now. -[referee] Just now? -He's in there now. -Out there? -Oh, yeah. Five stitches. [trainer] All right, this is going to go over your head, okay? {\an8}[Buddy] He went over and picked up a ball. {\an8}One guy hit him. He pushed him back. And two jumped on him. After that... punched him in the eye. He's gonna need about five or six stitches on it. [Wood] That's absolutely the craziest thing I've ever seen. Wow. Hit him. Non-padded kid. We've already talked to our guys about trying to play between the rules. It's gonna be a spirited deal, now. [stuttering] I can't believe that. [Buddy] Don't worry about what they're saying. Don't worry about what they're doing. If some extra-curricular activity happens, back off, 'cause I promise you, we're gonna score as absolute much as we can score tonight. [grunting] [player] They just trying to get us out of our mind. [DJ] They really just fixin' to make us go harder than we ever went. [Trickett] No, don't do anything stupid that'll get you... -I'mma try not to, God damn it. -...out of next game, man. [CJ] I was here by myself, bro. They ain't do shit. They ain't say a thing. [player] Man, stop peeking over here, man. We know y'all scared, man. None of that, none of that. -[whistle blows] -[Buddy] Hey, shut up. Shut up. Hey, shut up! Do all our talkin' in about... about 45. Don't worry about it. [Trickett] Man, y'all better be the most savage motherfuckers out here tonight. -If I was on, I'd kill someone. -[whistle blows] [chuckling] Ooh, I wish I was fucking playing. I'd be talking so much shit. [Buddy] Just keep it-- I just don't want anybody thrown out, either side. I just want to keep it calmed down. And if one of mine needs to come over here and sit for the rest of the game, let me know. -Yes. -I mean, I don't need no instigators. I need smart people. [players chanting] Let's go! [Buddy] That's it. [Wood] Do what you do now. Have fun, get after them suckers. They want a street fight, we'll get it, let's go. Dear God, thank you for these guys, the way they've worked. Thank you for all of our blessings. Help us to play this game in a violent and vicious manner and play it the way it's supposed to be played. [player] Family on me, family on three! One, two, three! [players] Family! [Lesley] Guys, this is what they did to one of ours. That's all I'm saying. If that don't piss you off, then you ain't got a goddamn heart. You goddamn sure ain't got love for one another. In between the whistles that are blown tonight, you fuck somebody up. For me. Understand, guys, please. You cannot throw a punch. But in between every whistle that you are on that football field, you fuck somebody up. You goddamn understand me? [players] Yes, sir! [Lesley] Every fucking play! [clicks tongue] They already know they was gonna lose but now they finna'... Man, I'm hitting everything movin'. -Man, look at Coach Lashlee. -Linemen, centers... Everything. I'm hitting everything. -[stutters] And there go Coach Lashlee. -Huh? Coach Lashlee. Right behind us, cus. Who? Coach Lashlee from Auburn. {\an8}-You should beat them. -Hmm. {\an8}And then it'll be Gulf Coast or who? {\an8}Or Northwest. And we've already beaten Northwest once. Hey, we about to tee-off on them, bro. I'mma tag off on somebody. I'mma cut a nigga or something. [Buddy] I don't care who you are. You don't put yourself in a position to hurt this team, by getting kicked out or having a personal foul. You take... Hey, you just whip their ass! That's it. You understand? You give them a stone-cold ass-whippin'! Now get your asses in here and everybody touch somebody. Hey, guys. Great season. Let's finish it up hard. You got me? Finish it up hard. Hurt 'em, hard. -Our Father... -[all] Who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name... [announcer 1] Roberts awaiting the snap of the football. Back to pass, dances a little bit. Fires it to a wide open Goss at the 30-yard line. He caught it and he's knocked to his, uh, back. And here come some penalty flags. [Buddy] Hey, shut up! Back up and shut up. Back up and shut up. [announcer 1] And now Buddy Stephens on the far sideline trying to get everybody under control. [announcer 2] This is the kind of game, the only way you get into trouble is if you lose your composure. Fuck them. Fuck they ass up. They done told you, but I'm gonna tell you one more time. They gon' try to get you throwed out the game, so you can't play next week. -Please, play smart. -Yes, sir. If you need to hit somebody, come talk to me first. I'll get 'em. Yes, sir. [announcer 1] There's still some chippy pushing and shoving going on, out on the field, but the officials get this one under control. No penalty flags. Watch it with the yapping to the side on that sideline. I hear 'em talking to you. Don't say nothing to 'em, just play. [announcer 1] Back to pass, Roberts is flushed out of the pocket from up the middle. Keeps it himself near side, has some running room. Inside the 20, inside the 15, and he's going to be down near the 10-yard line. [Wood] What is that? Gotta protect him in the slide! Here we go! Let's go, baby. [Wyatt grunts] [coach] John, get ready! [Wood] John, go! John, go! [John] Yo, yo. [Wood] John, go! Come on! There you go. Right, right, right. Hey, 33-Q. 33-Q. [John] Hey, 33! 33! -[Wyatt groans] -What'd he do? Roll your leg? -[Buddy] Hey, you all right? You okay? -[groaning] [announcer 1] Now they're gonna bring in John Franklin III at quarterback. Twin receivers either side, he'll take the snap. Franklin keeps it himself around the left side. Gets inside the ten, inside the five, going towards the goal line. Does he score? Touchdown! [crowd cheering] EMCC, and that's from 13 yards out, John Franklin III has the Lions on the board first. [trainer] Where? [Wyatt groans] It's been tight. -Um, right in there? -Over there, yeah, right there. -Go on over this way? -Yeah, right there. [announcer 1] Now we have a, uh, pushing-shoving incident that's going on over here and Mississippi Delta... -There's a penalty flag. -[Wood] No, no, no! No, no, no! You'll get ejected! Ezekiel! [announcer 1] This is going to be against Delta and it is. [Buddy] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! [shouting] Everybody get over here! Get over here! {\an8}There ain't but one way this team beats you. That's if they get you out of your game. -[Wood] Be smart. -That's if they get you out of your game. That's the only way they beat your butt. You understand? Now, hey! You play hard! And let that little shit go! 'Cause it'll be... It'll show on the damn scoreboard. Now let's go! All right? Let's go! [announcer 1] Here's the snap, pressure from the backside. Stepping up is John Franklin III, keeps it himself left side. Inside the 20. [announcer 2] Wow. [announcer 1] And he ran through traffic! First down and more. Fifteen, ten, five, stays on his feet. Touchdown, EMCC! [cheering] John Franklin III, second touchdown of this game! [announcer 2] My goodness! [announcer 1] It's 14-nothing with seven minutes to go here in the first quarter. [John] That's too easy, bro! {\an8}This shit too easy, bro! This shit too easy, bro! Too easy, bro! [announcer 1] Fires it up and it is tipped up and intercepted by EMCC inside the 30 and Powell comes up with the interception. What an athletic move. [rapping indistinctly] [rapping] They ain't scoring 'cause our foot is on their throat. They asleep right now and, yeah, they 'bout to choke. Hey. Whippin' ass all day, you know who. Hey. EMCC that's who. [announcer 1] So EMCC now has the football inside the 5-yard line. First down goal to go. And going around the right side is John Franklin III. He gets into the end zone. His third touchdown. The last three series. {\an8}[announcer 2] My goodness. Shit's too easy! [announcer 2] Have yourself a game, Mr. Franklin. [John] I can do this in my sleep. That's how you bounce back, yo! Last week, yo! That's how you bounce back! Yo, I'm 'bout to get this offer real quick, that's all. I'm just trying to get my offer. [announcer 1] Back to pass and fires it over the middle and he has a man... Caught by Brooks Shannon inside the 10-yard line. John Franklin III. They can't get a hold of him. And he breaks free inside the 35, inside the 30. Franklin with the snap. He rolls to his right. Fires it over the middle, has a man, and it is caught! Dario Robinson. Oh, my goodness, a one-handed grab. [announcer 2] Yes, it was. What a beautiful catch. -Hey, good. Nice. -[player] Boy, Oregon comin'. Hey, I'm telling you. Oregon comin'. [John grunting] Yeah, yeah! Yeah. I want this! Hey, they better come down personally to get him. [chuckles] [all laughing] [Wood] We're just gonna get you loose, we're not going back in. Not up 28 in the first quarter. We're not going to do it. Yes, sir. You okay? I know it's frustrating, you okay? Yes, sir. That hit was dirty, man. -Hmm? Yeah, it was. -[whistle blows] [John] They gonna keep blitzing me, I'mma keep taking off on they ass. [moaning] -[John chuckles] -[screams] [announcer 1] Back to pass, pocket collapses. He steps up, runs around the right side. He's gonna have the first down inside the 20, inside the 15, inside the ten, stays on his feet, five, touchdown! John Franklin III with his fourth rushing touchdown of this first half! Are you kidding me? And EMCC is up 40-nothing and the clock is rolling here in the second quarter and we are very thankful to the Lord for that. Here's pressure from the right side. Back side pressure for Franklin. Gets rid of it and it is caught and that is... Oh! And thrown out of bounds over on the far side. And there's a couple of penalty flags. Gonna be against Mississippi Delta. Late hit out of bounds. [Wood] He's down by 41, he's trying to get in your head! When he's talking to you and he's just trying to get in your head 'cause he's losing so bad. Don't worry about him. [announcer 1] John Franklin III in the shotgun. Here's the snap, back to pass, has pressure, steps up, runs it, has a lane. -[Buddy] Score! -He's out across the 45. He's in Delta territory down the sideline. [Wood] Look at him run, 20. Look at him run. Whoo! Look at that. You see that? [announcer 1] You've gotta be kidding me! The sixth touchdown for John Franklin III in this first half. Go, best friend! [referee] We got a hard enough time with your players talking to players. Your offensive coordinator just not be yelling, "20 red." Just tell him be quiet, please. [Buddy stutters] Okay. I will, I will. Yeah, yeah. I'll take care of it, I'll take care of that. [referee] I appreciate it, Coach. [Buddy] I'm sorry. [Wood] I shouldn't have done that. That is pretty good, though. I mean, it really is. You have two timeouts remaining in this half. [Buddy] I'mma call one right after this if they don't have an incomplete pass. [referee] Yes, sir. [Buddy chuckles] I'mma call timeouts to get the ball back. [announcer 2] I hesitate to mention this, but Buddy Stephens does have timeouts he can use if he chooses to. [announcer 1 chuckles] [announcer 1] He's gonna get the football back and all he needs is 30 seconds to score. Haymon's gonna bring it around near side and he's gonna be slung down at the line of scrimmage at the 16-yard line. Now we have a whistle and a timeout. [announcer 2] He did it. [announcer 1] Buddy Stephens is going to call the timeout and EMCC is gonna get the football back with 1:39 remaining. [DJ] Yeah, I already know. It's halftime. [chuckling] We up 48-0. It's over with. -[Buddy] Hey, score. Score. Score. Score. -[whistle blows] [player] We need to put up at least 70 or 80. -We gonna put up 50 before the half. -We gonna make a statement. Gotta make a statement, bro. We number three. [announcer 1] 1:03 remaining before halftime. [announcer 2] Plenty of time. [announcer 1] Snap, by Franklin. Screen pass. DJ Law was looking up field. That's gotta be a targeting penalty and it is. And then Law is gonna get up and slap him in the helmet. -[clamoring] -[whistle blowing] [player] DJ Law, Coach! They got him over there! They stompin' him, man! [Buddy] Get back, get back, get back. [player] They stompin' him, Coach! [clamoring continues] [announcer 1] This is totally out of control.
