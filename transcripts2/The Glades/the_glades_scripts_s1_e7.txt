 The Glades (2010â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 7 - Cassadaga - full transcript 
 Patrick, member of an influential community of mediums etcetera, is murdered at home. Carlos is spooked by the marsh area, the context and a prediction from Renee LeFleur that someone close to Jim will come to harm while he solves the case in Patrick's house. Although anything but a believer, Jim takes account of them, clients and their superstitious/fraudulent logic to solve the case and the disappearance years ago of a couple from the paranormal community. Meanwhile Callie refuses to attend her 'white coat' graduation with Jim, claiming that would stress out Jeff, then dates a doctor, while Jim accepts to accompany a medical saleswoman.

 What's wrong? The reading is over. Well, why? Patrick! Hey. Universal WiFi adapter. Jeff wanted me to get him one so we could play each other online. Oh, goody. Another reason for him not to do his homework. No. Homework comes first. Think of this as a motivational tool. Hey, Callie. Is Dr. McCord in? Uh, actually, he's gone all week.

 Sorry. Uh, Jim Longworth, this is Heather... Heather Thompson. Nice to meet you. Uh, yeah. Jim...Longworth. Uh, w-what she said. Oh. Uh, excuse me. Yeah? Okay, can I just leave these samples here for McCord? Do you mind signing for them? No problem. Uh, hey. I gotta go. I got a...Thing to, uh, attend to. Nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. Uh, Heather. Right? Right. Right. Okay. Who was that? A friend. Really? Just a friend? Really, just a friend. "Just a friend." Right. If you say so. "Welcome to Cassadaga." This town gives me the creeps. Why? It was founded by psychics and mediums over 100 years ago. So cops don't like setting foot in this town. Do you really believe in that stuff? No. Maybe. Yeah, the department's used a medium from here a couple of times. Woman named Renee Lefleur. She helped us find the body of a 16-year-old girl. Lucky guess? While working on the case, this Lefleur woman tells me an estranged relative is gonna get very sick and that I should make peace with him. Six weeks later, my Uncle gets diagnosed with cancer. Did you make peace? No. He was a mean son of a bitch but my point is, who wants to know their future? Not me. And not any cops i know. Why'd you stop? Got to obey the local traffic laws. Shh! Do you hear that? Even the dogs don't bark in this town. Boo! Funny. Real funny. Some say I don't play well with others. I was a damn good Detective in Chicago until a disagreement with my boss encouraged me to pack it up and make a change. So I put the Windy City in my rearview and headed to the Sunshine State to kick back, play some golf, work on my tan, maybe write the occasional speeding ticket. Yeah, well... That didn't work out. The Glades 1x07 Cassadaga Original Air Date on August 22, 2010 -- Sync, corrected by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com -- That first on scene? Yes, it is, sir. Welcome back, Mr. Sanchez. Miss Lefleur. This is Detective Longworth. This is Caitlin Zelman, the victim's wife. I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Zelman. I wish to offer my services to help find whoever did this to Patrick. Your relation to him? He was a friend. Same line of business? Similar. He was a psychic. I'm a medium. And the difference is...? A psychic can tell you your past, present, and future by reading your energy field. A medium can communicate with the spirits of the dead. Good to know. Well, we'll call you if we need you. You'll call. Either he has really slow reflexes, or I see a fatal flaw in his psychic ability. These people have walk-in business, so they keep their front doors open. So we don't know if the killer was invited in. It doesn't feel like a robbery. Have I mentioned how this place gives me the creeps? Can you give us a minute? Of course. Your husband have any enemies? No. How long you been married? 10 months. Oh! Newlyweds. Yeah? First time? I'm divorced. How long? 11 months. Wow. Quick turnaround. How'd your ex feel about this marriage? Not great. His name? Evan Gratton. He, uh, is a Merchant Mariner. Shipped out? No. He just returned from eight months out to Sea. An ex-husband with hard feelings, huh? My ex would never have done this sort of thing. Well, that in there looks pretty personal. Nothing more personal than a... Than an ugly divorce. Don't you think? All right. Well, look, Mrs. Zelman... I'm gonna ask you to walk inside, maybe take a look around. See if you can see anything that's missing. You think you can do that? Okay. Yeah? Okay. Here. You take her in? Can you take Mrs. Zelman in? Yes, sir. Thank you. Sara Weston? You found the body? Uh, yes. Says here you had a psychic sense that Patrick was dead. That's right. How's that work? I can't explain my gift. I've just always had it. Uh...Well, I'm not psychic, so I'm gonna need some details as to the circumstances. I was giving a reading across the street in my house. Who to? Uh, a woman -- Dr. Britney Newhall. She called me from D.C., said she was going to be in town. She had been to Patrick and wanted to try someone different. I think the fact that this woman had been to Patrick triggered my feeling him, which led me to sense his death. Any sense of the killer? No. Oh. Well, maybe I should speak to a medium to get Patrick to say who killed him. Are you making fun, Detective? A little. You'll see. Where do I find this Britney Newhall? She's at the hotel. There's only one. Oh, so, I don't need my palm read to find it, then. Tamarac. Sorry. What? Your wife. Oh. Not married. Your wife will be from Tamarac. Yeah. So, how long had you been getting readings from Patrick Zelman, Dr. Newhall? About three years. My mother lived nearby, before she passed away five months ago. I would come and see Patrick whenever I came to town. So, two, three times a year? We also had some palm readings. So, after all this time, why change psychics? I've seen others off and on. Yeah, but why were you looking to change now? When I first started with Patrick, I felt that he was adding insight to my life. And lately I just -- I didn't get that. You're a medical doctor, right? Yes. Many people in your profession use psychics? Professionals of all types see psychics. Yeah, but... I get a lump on my head, I want a doctor to go to a book, not a Tarot card. I can separate out the two. I'm not looking to channel dead relatives. I just think that science doesn't always have the answers. Did you have to drag me all the way down to Homestead? I don't like to go into a suspect's apartment alone. You do realize I don't carry a gun, right? Yeah, but the bad guys don't know that. Evan Gratton? I'm gonna ask you a few questions. Can I come in? What's going on? Your ex-wife's husband was killed this morning. What? Yeah. Stabbed in Cassadaga. You haven't been to Cassadaga recently, have you? Never set foot. Oh. I've been at sea for the last eight months! Oh, yeah. Heard, when you came back to a little surprise. Yeah. You could say that. Instead of being greeted with a hug, I was greeted with divorce papers. So I'm guessing you're not a Patrick Zelman fan, are you? I never met the man. But what kind of man steals another man's wife when he's gone? Oh, nice. What is that? Zulu warrior shield from South Africa. I just brought it back. Nine months is a long time to stew about being two-timed. Believe me, man. I'm over Caitlin. Got myself a new Lady. Congratulations. Whatever. Caitlin was always into that psychic crap. Wasn't surprised she ended up with one of those whack jobs. Whack jobs, huh? Got an alibi for yesterday? I do. Yeah. I was with Tammy all day. Just ask her. Tammy! Hey, Tams! Did the wife find anything of her husband's missing in the house? Just one thing -- his reading glasses. His reading glasses? Bought at your friendly neighborhood drugstore. Huh. Detective Longworth. Miss Lefleur. What can we do for you? It's more what i can do for you. I had a vibration today. A vibration? Someone near you is going to die very soon. Near him? Be very careful. See? Nothing good ever comes from me being near you. Nothing. Oh, man! Oh. Hey. Here. Let me help you with that. Oh, thanks. Jim, right? Uh, yeah. Heather. Yeah? That's it. Ohh. Ah. Ohh! What have you got in here? Drugs. I'm a professional pusher. Oh. Good to know. What do you do? I am a cop. I put away professional pushers. Well, you're holding my bag. Doesn't that make you my mule or something? Oh, wow. I've been called a jackass a few times in my life -- never a mule. Yeah, well, giddyup, mule. What's the street value on this thing? Most of it's more likely to give you a nasty discharge than any kind of an actual high. Oh, well, that'll keep demand down. There you go. Thanks again. No problem. See ya. Bye. Any problems getting Jeff to do his homework? None. Oh, he must be motivated. Yeah, that must be it. Got something for me? "Forza motorsport." Really? Hit Max rpms last week. Mm. You look busy. Yeah, I'm trying to catch up so I can go to this white coat ceremony. What's that? It's where the Dean hands us our first white physician coat. It's mostly symbolic. Sounds kind of special. Well, it is... Kind of special. And there's this after-party that's supposed to be fun. Need a date? I mean, if that's something you think we could...Do. Or not? I'm concerned about Jeff. I thought he liked me. Jeff loves you. I just think it might freak him out if we went on an actual date. Oh. Oh, I...I didn't realize. I didn't... Okay. Um... Where are you from? Where am I from? Been meaning to ask you for a while. Where are you from? Coral Springs. Coral Springs. Why? No reason. No reason. Hey, Jim! You know what? If life has taught me anything, it is to grab the bull by the horns -- so to speak. I need a date to the white coat party. Interested? A date? Yeah, it'll be fun. Open bar, lots of food... Cheesy deejay. Um... She's right. Sounds like fun. Well, oh, okay. Great! It's a date. Here's my card. We can work out the details later. Just give me a call. Okay. Oh... Okay. See ya. Bye. She always that aggressive? Guess you'll soon find out. You wanted to see me? Uh, Patrick Zelman. I want you to do a background check. Criminal, personal, financial. Uh, Jim. Jim, one sec. This is Adam Quinn, president of the Cassadaga town council. This murder has shaken our community. Something like this hasn't happened in Cassadaga since that young couple five years ago. Right. The young couple? Yeah. Paul and Linda Gilbert. They left Cassadaga and haven't been seen or heard from since. We never found their bodies, but we presumed foul play. I want to offer the assistance of my town. Your town? Oh. Wow. That's nice. Did your town help, uh, five years ago with the young couple? Yes, but for some reason, they were unable to make contact. What, do the dead have low or high frequencies? How does that work? That part is a mystery. That's one word for it. Call you if we need you. Uh, would you excuse me? Jim. So... Is it your goal in life to offend everyone or just the people i have to tread lightly around? Why do you have to tread lightly around Mr. Magoo? Because, despite your skepticism, they have helped the FDLE in the past. Uh, yeah. That is Scary. What is Renee Lefleur's history with the FDLE? Actually, she's who I'm talking about. She's helped in a number of cases. I know it's politically tricky to involve a psychic or a medium in a criminal investigation. Why? What is she saying? No, it's what she's not saying. You think she's hiding something? I think they're all hiding something. I was under the impression you weren't planning on using the town psychics or mediums. I wasn't. Then why are we gonna go see miss Lefleur? If her abilities are good enough for the FDLE, they're good enough for me. Besides, I think she's hiding something. Maybe a reading will tell me what it is. In 50 yards, make a legal u-turn. You're lost, aren't you? I didn't say that. We were just here yesterday. I'm taking another route. I'm taking in the countryside. In 30 yards, make a legal u-turn. You're lost. Approaching -- right. This thing's going in and out. Turn left. You know, some people say the psychic energy in Cassadaga impacts these GPS devices. Or maybe we're just in a dead zone. Every time I'm near you, I'm in a dead zone, apparently. You do know psychics just say very general things, and we fill in the blanks, right? 30 yards, turn right. What is general about "someone near you is gonna die very soon"? That sounds pretty specific to me. Approaching right turn. Turn left. Turn left. Oh, Lady, you are not helping. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? Where are you going? Watch out! Whoa! Is that blank general enough for you? Well, I brought Patrick Zelman's wedding ring, like you asked. Place it on the table. Where is Dr. Sanchez? Uh, out guarding the car. Does your car need guarding? He thought it did. Why Zelman's wedding ring? Any metal object of his would do. It's called psychometry. Metal objects belonging to a person, dead or alive, contain energy that helps transfer information from that person. Just not that couple that went missing five years ago, huh? Sadly, I could not connect to their spirits. As a medium, most of my work involves death. I just wish I could prevent a tragedy some time. Do you... Always. In case you'd like to refer to the session later. Oh. I'm getting that Patrick knew the person who killed him... And that the person who killed him... Has been in his house. To kill him. Yeah. You won't find answers there. This person returned to the house after you removed his body. This person is afraid and returned to the house after killing Patrick. The answer is in his house. Someone has been here. Carlos? Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! How's he doing? Oh, a few scratches. A little ringing in the ears, but seems okay. Look at you. Not a scratch, huh? Next time, you're opening the front door, my friend. He seems like his normal self. All the same, he should get a CT Scan, make sure there's no swelling or brain bruises. Yeah. Go. Go. Be good. Thanks. All right. The gas was turned on in the house. That in combination with some form of combustible caused the explosion. What was combustible? We haven't determined that yet. It's still under investigation. It's not a brand I'm familiar with, but I'm not a smoker. Get a country of origin for me? Right. Yeah. Oh. And I checked out the victim -- Patrick Zelman. When he was 18, he had an "assault with a deadly weapon" charge that was pled down to a misdemeanor battery. And his financials? Three times in the last two years, he took out big chunks of money -- only to have even bigger deposits shortly thereafter. Six weeks ago, he withdrew almost all his money. This last time, it wasn't followed by a big deposit. He died sort of broke. Where'd his money go? All four withdrawals were checks written to investment firms. Uh-huh. Follow the money. Oh! And can you look into couple that went missing in Cassadaga about five years ago, Paul and Linda Gilbert? Find out where they were staying, who they saw, make and model of the car they were driving. On it. So, um, I'm curious. Do you really think Renee Lefleur sent you to that house to kill you? She sent us there for some reason. Well, what was the reason? Well, she said the killer had gone back there after the murder, and she said that the answer was in the house. Oh. And you just ran right over to look? I guess you're not such a skeptic after all. Oh, no. I'm a skeptic. But I am gonna get her in for questioning. 132 over 70. Not bad. Oh, so he's gonna live? No thanks to you. His MRI, CT, and chest X-rays all came back normal. Yeah. But do you know how much radiation was zapped into my body to get those results? He gets good news, he still complains. Hey. When do I leave? Guys! Uh, hey, so, listen. About this white coat thing? White coat ceremony? The ceremony. Yeah. Sorry. Uh, I don't have to go. Why wouldn't you go? Well, you know, it might be a little awkward for you. Because of Heather? Oh, please don't flatter yourself. I mean, listen. Heather is a sweet girl, once you get past the salesman bluster. And she's carefree and fun. And you guys will have a blast. So...For you, it's okay. I mean, it's just a party. Yeah, but, you know, technically, you'll be there alone. Who said I'll be there alone? Oh. Well... Well, no one said it. I just... Radiology, consult 417. Radiology, 417. Yeah? Blue tail -- that cigarette butt -- is only sold in South Africa. Does that mean anything to you? Yeah. It means Evan Gratton lied about never being in Cassadaga. This guy's been around. Last place he was in was South Africa. Carlos. Hmm? Admiring isn't searching. Fine. But what the hell are we searching for? We'll know when we find it. Uh, just so you know, any suspicious boxes you're opening, I've made my quota of things that go "boom." What do you got? Taped sessions with Lefleur. Why the hell would he have those? Hey, Dr. Fenton. Hey, Callie. How's that boy of yours? He's good. Thank you. Uh, I have this thing tonight -- the white coat after-party. And I totally understand if you have much more important things To do... The white coat after-party? Sounds like fun. Okay. Well, I mean, if you can't, I understand. Say no more. I'd love to go. You'd love to. But you know I'm married. Right? So this is just... You know. Know what? Oh. Of course. Say no more. Say no more. Pick you up at 8:00? 8:00 is good. You have some...Thing on your nose. Yeah, you got it. That box I found in your apartment was your ex-wife, Caitlin's, wasn't it? Must have got mixed up in your stuff during the divorce. Recorded sessions between Caitlin and Renee Lefleur and with her future husband, Patrick Zelman. Dated 13 months ago. That's before Caitlin filed for divorce. Wasn't it? I don't know what to do. I'm getting a strong feeling that you and Evan have tried, but you just aren't connecting anymore. Even when he is home, it's like he's a million miles away. I would always go to my dad for answers, but he's dead. If I thought my father would approve... Then ask him. What?! Ask your father. Speak with Renee Lefleur. The dead reach out to her. You must have felt like shit! Listening to this joker convince Caitlin to dump you and run off with him. Yeah, she was duped. Yeah. With the help of Renee Lefleur, and that just ate at you, didn't it? Stuck away in some cargo ship for months on end with only your magazines for company while your wife schtups some guy back home? You left a cigarette at the scene, got your DNA all over it. Okay, fine. I went there. Hell yeah. But not to kill him. I just wanted to tell him I knew what he did. I wanted to call him a home wrecker to his face. Yeah, then things got out of hand. I didn't lay a hand on him. Where was Caitlin during all this? This wasn't about her, man. This was about that son of a bitch disrespecting me by going after what was mine. Yeah, now he's dead, you can go and reclaim what's yours, right? I didn't kill Patrick Zelman. Detective? Can I see you? We found Renee Lefleur. Well, you know, her vibration came true. What do you mean? She said someone near me was gonna die. It just happened to be her. Evan Gratton had it in for both Patrick and Renee Lefleur. So what was Lefleur hiding? Coercion, fraud. Zelman must have convinced Lefleur to give a false reading. Told Caitlin that her deceased father said it was okay for her to leave her husband, Evan, for Zelman. Hmm. I guess that's fraud in the spirit world. Yeah, and a good motive for murder in ours. Car could have easily pulled up here undetected. Evan's a big guy. He wouldn't have had a problem with Lefleur's body. Only... That's not what happened. Why do you say that? Well, two things. Evan was a skeptic, like me. I mean, it's one thing killing a guy for boning your wife. Any nonbeliever would do that. And the other thing? Time of death. Which, according to her liver temp, was while Evan Gratton was in custody. Oh, well, at least we know one thing we didn't know before -- whoever killed these people is a true believer. Meaning what? Meaning, Lefleur is dead because Patrick Zelman's killer was worried she'd contact Zelman's spirit. Dead mediums tell no tales. Anthony Batista. Thanks! Chris Beckler. Hey! Lewis Bowen. You came to see your friend. That is so sweet! Yeah. You too. Oh, no. I'm afraid my motives are slightly more self-serving. These students are gonna be doctors someday. Haley Cimino. Oh. Future customers. Well, if not actual customers, I mean, some of them could end up working for the pharmaceutical companies I represent or sitting on the FDA board that approves the drugs I sell. Callie Cargill. Congratulations. Thank you. What was that you were just saying? About them not being your customers? Jonathan Carlson. Oh, not all doctors go into practice. You know, some end up working for pharmaceutical companies. Some end up going into research. Some sit on FDA approval boards. Huh. Oh. Thank you. Uh, see you tonight. Right? Right. Jeremy Carvallo. Got that information that you needed. Yeah, I got something else I want you to do. See if you can find out where a Dr. Britney Newhall works in D.C. Got it. And I followed the money like you asked me. Patrick Zelman made four investments in the biotech industry. On the first three, he made a bunch of money. On the last one, he lost it all. And the other thing? Ah, well, as best as I can make out, psychics and mediums believe the burning of sage is a cleansing tool -- like cleaning the palate of negative energy after each vibration. Burns like what, like an accelerant? No. It burns too slow for an accelerant. It's more of a smolder than a quick burn. Kind of like a timer. Mrs. Zelman. Been to your house lately? Just to check the mail. And maybe burn it down? No, I had nothing to do with that. Well, the gas was left on, so something set it off. I'm thinking it was probably the clump of sage that was found in your house. I mean, it's slow burning, so that would allow you to get away before the gas went off. I left the sage in the fireplace. And I didn't turn on the gas. Well, someone did. Look, some evil person killed Patrick. I-I wanted to cleanse my house of that presence. How did Patrick make his investment choices? What are you talking about? Well, he was heavily in the market, right? He was a psychic. He would get a feeling or a vibration about certain stocks. Just not very good ones. I mean, come on. You're broke, right? Apart from the life-insurance policy you're gonna get for Patrick's death. But that was from poor investment decisions. You think I killed my husband... Over money? We were just married. Yeah. That doesn't clear you... If that's where you were going with that. Yeah? Got it. But that phone call does. So, have a nice day. So, I didn't mention I was on an fda approval board. That doesn't prove that I -- no, it does... Actually. The three biotech stocks that Zelman made his money on, and the one that he lost all his money on, just happened to be in companies that were waiting on FDA approval for drugs. And in all these cases, you, in your capacity as a doctor, sat on the committee making those decisions. I mean, what, did you have a deal where you shared the windfall? Did he renege on the deal? So you fed him bad intel? Patrick got information from me, but not how you think. Well, how'd he get it? The first time, I think it was a true psychic event while he was giving me a reading. It's true. After that, I don't think he could get a read. So he would... Steer my sessions towards my work and then try to prompt me to give him information. And you know this because... I was suspicious, so I went back and listened to his readings. The tapes were all conveniently blank. But the only way I could know for sure was to give him false information... And then see if he took it. So I sort of let it slip that... A drug was getting approval when I knew that we were going to deny it. You know, the S.E.C. tracks these big-stock windfalls that Patrick had. You could lose your job, end up in jail from insider trading. It's a pretty good reason to kill someone. But I didn't. Sara warned me to stay in D.C., not to come to Cassadaga. Wait, she warned you? Like, specifically warned you? I sent her my bracelet, and she gave me a phone reading. I didn't tell her any other details, but she's...Really good. Well, God, finally. I was beginning to wonder about you people. Someone with real psychic ability. Well, Sara was right. You do have big trouble in your life. By warning you not to come to Cassadaga, she was trying to keep you from that trouble, but You didn't listen, did you? I didn't kill Patrick Zelman. I didn't kill anybody. Well... I'm no psychic, but... It seems to me that if you trust someone as much as you trust Sara, and they warn you, you should probably heed their advice. Some people say psychics just use a little bit of intuition mixed in with a generous dose of bullshit. Then you missed your calling, 'cause you would have made one hell of a psychic. I already am one. I figured out what happened to Paul and Linda Gilbert, didn't I? Now easy. Up, up, up, up, up. We assumed these two were the victims of foul play. Turns out it was just an accident. Once I figured out the make and model of the car and where they were staying, the vibrations just came to me. They were following their Mercury's first-generation GPS system to get out of town. Which doesn't work very well in this area, which we nearly found out the hard way. People of my community couldn't make contact with them because they were submerged under 15 feet of water, Detective. Oh. Oh, that's it. Yeah. I don't know anyone in Cassadaga who's a true believer who wouldn't act on a vibration if they thought it would save a life. You know what? I actually believe you. Where are you going? To finish our job here. Detective Longworth? I opened the mail today and... Found a letter from Patrick. To me. Hi. Can I come in? Of course. Thank you. Wow. It's nice. I heard about Britney Newhall. Yeah. We had to take her in. Is she okay? Oh. I wanted to talk to you about her state of mind. Okay. Yeah. You performed a reading for her on the phone? Yes, while she was in D.C. Yeah, and she sent you a bracelet? I use that for -- psychometry. Yeah. I know. Wow, that's a lot of crystals. Uh, did she tell you that Patrick Zelman was using information that he got from her for illegal stock transactions? Miss Weston? Yes? U-uh, no. Well, did she mention anything about her job at the FDA? No. Well, I'm gonna need a statement from you as to exactly what she told you. A statement. Yes. Of course. Are you all right? Would you excuse me for one moment? Sure. Bought these at your local drugstore. It's over, Sara. In my phone readings with Dr. Newhall, I got the sense that she was in danger from someone here in Cassadaga. She mentioned that Patrick was her only connection here. So I stole the glasses. I saw it clear as day. Patrick lost a lot of money because of Dr. Newhall. He was gonna kill her. But you couldn't know that for sure. Five years ago, I did a reading for that young couple who disappeared. They were just passing through on their way to a wedding. I had the same undeniable sense that they were going to die. For five years, I've lived with the guilt that I should have done more. I couldn't live with that guilt again. You tried to warn Dr. Newhall not to come here, didn't you? I did, but it didn't matter. Even if Dr. Newhall hadn't come here, Patrick would have gone there and killed her. And I knew the police wouldn't listen. So you had to take matters into your own hands. I did what I had to do. Including trying to burn down Patrick's house. And then you had to kill Renee Lefleur because you're a true believer. You truly believe that Patrick Zelman is talking to her from the grave, telling her that it was you that killed him. She came to me, threatened to go to the police. And you had to silence her. What's that? It's a letter that Patrick sent to his wife. In it he says, uh... "If you are reading this, it means that I'm dead, killed by my own hand for taking a person's life." And he goes on to say why he'd killed Dr. Newhall for losing all his money in a stock deal. But he didn't get a chance to kill Dr. Newhall... Or himself, did he? But you see... I was right. I saved a life. By taking one? Oh, no. I'm sorry. Two? I mean, it is just two, right? There's not someone else's body out there we don't know about? You know the difference between a psychic that sees the future and a psychic that tries to change it? Life in prison? Wow. You are good. Hey! Okay. I have some advice for you. After 10:00 P.M. avoid the Dean at all costs, because by then, he will be completely hammered. And trust me, you do not want to hear his war stories about working in the geriatric wing of Miami Dade. Good to know. Thanks for coming tonight. I know when you're at a party where you don't know anyone, and you have nothing in common with anyone, it can be a real drag. It's no problem. I kind of feel like this at most parties anyway, so... Well, if you let me, I could make it up to you. My dad has a yacht. Oh. A really big yacht. Do you sail? I don't. No. But I drink beer. And I can hang my feet off the edge of the yacht. Sounds perfect. Oh, God. There's Dr. Yarnell. Head of Cardiology. I have to go grind him for a second. Do you mind? No. No. Go grind. Okay. Hey! Hi. How are you? Thank you. You're welcome. Wow! Don't you clean up nicely. I was gonna say the same thing about you. Cheers. Cheers. So where's your date? Oh, she's over there, grinding the head of Cardiology. Uh, you? He's over there, wishing he were the head of Cardiology. Think you're gonna fit in with this crowd? Oh, once you get past the power plays and the egos, they're relatively harmless. You know I really did want to ask you to this, right? Well, I kind of hoped.
