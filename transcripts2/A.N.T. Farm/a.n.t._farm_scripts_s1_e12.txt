 You sure your mom won't mind us hanging out at your place? Oh, not at all. She has an open door policy. What's going on? Whoa! I got it! I got it. What? Wow, you have a bouncy house! My mom won't even let me jump on the bed. Whee! Hey, Mom.

 Hi, sweetie! Mom, you told me you were working at a birthday party today, but why is it at our house? Because I realized I could charge twice as much this way. And I'm not "Mom," I'm Princess Eczema! Uh, why are you named after a skin disease? Because skin diseases all sound magical. Okay, girls, time for the pony rides in the mystical garden of Rosacea! Ponies? Please tell me the mystical garden of Rosacea is in the backyard, and not my bedroom.

Oh! Gorgeous! Thank you. I have been told that I have perfect bone structure. Not your face, the artwork on it. Can I show this to my mom? I want this exact bed spread. Wait a minute. This, this use of color, the flowing brush strokes... Who painted this? The court Jester. That's no court Jester, that, that's Zanko! I think I read something about Zanko once. "Zanko was considered of his generation "until he lost fell on hard times, "and disappeared from the art scene "to become a birthday party face-painter, "citation needed." Ooh! Citation found! Ooh! It's been I ate my cake. Ince I can get back in the bouncy house! Whee! Zanko was my inspiration. If it weren't for him, I probably wouldn't be an artist! Then what are you waiting for? Go introduce yourself. Me? Talk to Zanko? I'm not worthy. He's making a hot Fudge sundae in his pocket. I think you're worthy. I'll bring him over. Uh, Chyna, no! I can't! It's okay. I've gotta get out of here! Help! The kingdom of Psoriasis is collapsing around me! Surprise! You knew it was my birthday? Uh, of course! Happy Birthday! Wait, there should be cake. Where's the cake? I'll find it. Actually, Fletcher, the surprise is for you. It's time to meet your hero. Aquaman is here? In the Ant Farm? You got Aquaman? Aquaman is not here. And why is he your hero? Unless a crime is committed underwater, he can't do anything. Fletcher, meet Zanko. Zanko? Uh, these days, most people call me, "Hey, put your clothes on! "That fountain's not for bathing!" I was just showing Zanko some of your paintings. Oh! Yeah, you know, this is a true work of art. And if it were hanging in my house, I would stare at it for hours and hours. But... I do not have a house. Well, offer it to him. I can't offer him my house. My parents just re-did the kitchen. Not your house, your painting! Look, he inspired you, maybe you can inspire him. Cake? It would be an honor knowing that Zanko had one of my paintings. Zanko? Hmm? Would you like to have my... Socks? I, uh... No, painting. Oh! Um, sure. That, uh, that would be good, too. I found the cake! It's not the greatest cake, but... It was sweet of you to wish me a "good year." Hi, Mrs. Parks. I'm here about that ad you posted on the school website about the princess job opening. Good. I really need help entertaining these kids. They don't seem to like my newest game, "Sit Down and Be Quiet!" Well, as you can see, I'm everything you could want in a princess. Pretty, beautiful, and gorgeous! Well, actually, I do have one other applicant. Hi, I'm Paisley! You know what's totally wild? I have a friend who looks exactly like you! Paisley, I'm Lexi. Oh, my gosh! Her name is Lexi, too! Okay, I have an idea. You two can both work my next party and I'll see who does a better job. Fine. But not only am I gonna gonna win, I'm gonna crush you. Wow, that's totally something my friend Lexi would say! Olive, what happened to your face? I washed it. But it used to be so beautiful. And now it's... Ugh, I can't even look at it. Well, at least my face isn't black and blue like yours. Mine's not black and blue. Not yet. Guys! I have exciting news! And no, it has nothing to do with Aquaman. Zanko is unveiling a brand new painting at the Bay View Gallery tonight! Really? Wow! Uh, I wonder if there's a picture on the gallery website. Oh, man, your artwork must have inspired him! This is unbelievable... I know. And I hate to mention it, but none of this would have happened if I hadn't brought Zanko to you. Zanko ripped me off. Yeah, you're welcome... Wait, what? He took my painting and is claiming that it's his. He signed his name on my work. Thanks a lot, Chyna. And just to be clear, I wasn't really thanking you. I'm actually quite upset. Thanks for coming to back me up, Olive. Back you up? I only came because this place is next to the city's best Udon noodle house. Look, I'm a baby bird. Oh, there he is! So, how should we play this? Good cop, bad cop? Tall cop, short cop? Happy cop, sad cop? Mmm-mmm. How about... You go over there and talk to him... Okay. While I stay here and eat soup. All right. Working cop, lazy cop it is. It's a beautiful painting. Thank you. Too bad you didn't paint it. Fletcher did. Zanko doesn't know what you're talking about. Don't play games with us! I should take this bowl of hot soup and throw it right in your face! But I can't, it's too good. Zanko suggests you try their Bibimbap. They make their own Hoisin sauce. Really? That sounds good. But they don't go too heavy on the sesame oil, do they? No, no, no, just a splash... Enough about the soups. You stole Fletcher's art and put your name on it. How dare you accuse Zanko of stealing? Because Zanko is guilty of stealing. Chyna was there and Chyna knows the truth. Why is Chyna talking in the third person? Olive thinks it sounds cool. Security, throw them out! Hey! Stealing an art piece, that happens, but you do not mess with a girl's soup! So, on a scale of one to ten, how pretty do you think I am? Ew! What is that thing? A frog. Greg brings it everywhere. If you're a real princess, kiss it and turn it into a prince. Kiss it! Kiss it! Kiss it! Kiss it! Kiss it! Kiss it! There's no way I'm kissing that disgusting ball of slime! Can I see him? Aw! Hi, little guy! Oops! It jumped out the door! Come back! You made a real prince, and he brought pizza. You're the best princess ever! Come on! What kind of prince drives a moped? I'm so sorry, Fletcher. We couldn't get your painting back. What? But the gallery opening is tonight. He's going to sell my painting and it will be gone forever. Wait, it gets worse. He took my soup! Don't worry, I have an idea. A way we can get it back. But wouldn't my soup be cold by now? Not the soup. I was thinking we could steal your painting back. And I know just the team of experts for the job. And great friend. Polite, funny, stunningly beautiful, lover of animals, deep sleeper, knows how to microwave popcorn to maximum poppage without burning a single kernel... Okay, we're done. Thank you all for coming to see. Zanko's latest masterpiece, entitled... "Zanko's Latest Masterpiece!" Okay, switch places with me. You wanna be the mermaid? No. I want to be Aquaman, but that's the next best thing. I can't find my mommy! It's okay, little girl. Calm down. Now, tell me what your mommy looks like and I'll go find her. I have to warn you, I've never had much luck finding women. She has purple hair, a gold tooth, and a glass eye. Okay. You just wait right here and I'll go find your mommy. Please hurry. I miss her so much! Come on, come on. I am digging the little girl voice. Angus! Come on. Oh! Okay, I'm shutting down the security cameras. Mr. and Mrs. Angus Chestnut have tied the knot. That is not the code we discussed. Copy. Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher Quimby are walking down the aisle. That is not the code we discussed. No one's looking. Now's our chance to get over to the air vent. Okay, okay. Commence Operation What's That Smell? "Operation What's That Smell"? The moldy sandwich we found at the bottom of Angus' locker? Did you pay any attention during the code meeting? What are you doing? Uh, taking turns. It's only fair. What's that smell? Okay, for once, it's not me. Okay, time to intercept Zanko's call. Maintenance, here. There is a horrible stench in the gallery, and Zanko needs it fixed immediately! I'll, uh, have someone from the Horrible Stench Department to check it out. Wow. I am digging the deep voice, too. Uh, Apparently, it's pretty bad. They sent a guy in a hazmat suit, and a wolf suit. Okay, we need to clear the room. I'm gonna need everybody to run out of here in a screaming panic. If I've learned one thing, it's that people always do the opposite of what I say. Ah! That's why I would never say, "Please leave in a calm and orderly fashion." No! No! Here's your balloon animal. It's a... Earthworm! I asked for a pony. Well, you don't always get what you want. I asked for a real pony when I was six, and I got one, so... Bad example. I can try to make a pony! Ooh! Wow! Here you go! Just watch out for the balloon pony droppings. Whoa! It's not funny! Don't worry. Just grab onto the ladder and I'll pull you into my balloon-copter. There's the painting. Come on, let's get it. Wait! We're in lock down. There is probably an invisible laser net. Luckily, I have a dancer's body. There are no lasers. Time to disable the locking mechanism on the glass case. All I have to do is, bypass the... Look who I found! Wow, you're good! What are you doing? Um... I'm Ted, the new guy. Go ahead and take the rest of the night off. Awesome! Thanks, Ted! Angus, hurry up and unlock the glass case! Hey, wait. I'm Ted, the new guy. Run! Something's wrong. Angus isn't responding. All right. I'm going to have to break the glass with my Taekwon... Doh! Wait a second. Maybe I can break it. If I hit the right resonance frequency, I could shatter the glass. I'm sorry, Wacky. Let me try another frequency. Ooh, yes! Yes! What do you think you are doing? Abort the mission! Ants on the run! Security? Grab them! They can't see us, let's go! Ow! This feather is ironically heavy! Quick, run! There. Your masterpiece is back where it belongs. I just wish we could have stayed to see the look on Zanko's face when he noticed the painting was gone. Oh, he'll never know it's missing. What do you mean? Before I ran out, like all great art thieves, I replaced the painting with a perfect replica. Oops. That way, Zanko will think we failed, and never come after us. So you gave Zanko another one of your paintings? Nope, forgery. Done by you. Which makes it another original. Oh. I didn't think of that. I guess we'll have to reassemble the team. Okay, we're done. All right, kids, it's time to vote. Who likes Princess Paisley best? Who likes Princess Lexi? You remind me of my friend. I don't understand. I mean, I've been terrible at everything. Yeah, but that's what makes you funny. There's nothing funny about being good at your job. Congratulations, Lexi. You will be working the next birthday party. Greg's. He wants a princess at his party? Not exactly. This is the Goliath Bird-eating Spider. Did you say "Bird-eating?" Eat her! Eat her! Eat her! Eat her! Eat her! Eat her! Eat her! Eat her! Eat her! Eat her!
