And I made her mother promise to never tell her. So you're divorced? Three years this july. Because you're gay? I'm not gay. Okay, um... sorry. Because you prefer dick. - Chuckling) - Sigh) I started dating rhonda's mother to keep up appearances. Then we got pregnant. Her parents pressured us into getting married. But before we did, I told her what the deal was. What did she say? Well, she wasn't exactly happy to hear it. But she believed... I believed that... she could convert me. Chuckles) - That I could be healed. - Hmm. And you never asked yourself, "why do I keep looking at that man's ass?" Both laughing) Then one day... one of my very fine, ambiguously gay clients invited me out on a boat trip. But I knew that, if I went out on that boat, I was gonna end up sleeping with a dude. - So I told my wife. - What? She cried. I cried. And we split up. Till this day, rhonda doesn't know why. Are you ever gonna tell her? No. Why? 'Cause I don't wanna lose her. I want you to come to dinner. Me? Why? So she can get used to you being around. That way I won't have to hide you. So you want me to play the client. Just until she goes back to school. - Oh, man. I don't know. - Look... I really like you. Y ou're the first man that I've ever been with that I didn't immediately run away from. I want... I don't know. Y es, you do. I wanna be with you. Only I don't know how. Let's just take it one step at a time. Okay? Okay. Y ou know... technically... we're not strangers anymore. So? Chuckles) So? ...oh, how I need you so much... ...continues indistinct) ...I need to feel your touch... ...craving your touch... ...saving my love... ...for the next time... ...when I'm yours and you're mine... ...baby, it's the real thing... ...exciting... ...when we... ...made up that night... ...two sparks ignite... ...continues indistinct) ...all I need is your love... ...I need you so much... ...continues indistinct) Chuckling) Shall we say grace? Dear lord, we ask that you bless this food - and keep it safe for the... - amen. ...for the nourishment of our bodies. And bless this new union, lord, between daddy and austin. May they find success in all business endeavors. In your name, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Shall we eat? So, austin... um, did you... study acting? Or are you a model turned actor? Busted. Well, can you actually act? Because I'm tired of all you pretty boys taking away the parts from good, bona fide talent of course he can act. That's why I signed him. Well, you sure do have the looks. Thanks. So, austin, do you have a girlfriend? Rhonda, why don't we let him eat? No, that's all right. Well, see... I'm seeing someone, uh, but... I'm not sure where it's going. Chuckles) Well, if she doesn't work out... chuckles) I'll keep you in mind. That wine's got me a little woozy. - Are you okay to drive? - I'm cool. I'm cool. - Y eah? Okay. - Thanks. - Let me go get your coat. - Okay. Here you go. Oh, you're too kind. Rhonda, thank you for dinner. - Well, good luck with your career. - Thank you. I'm sure I'll see you again. Come on, I'll walk you out. Bye. - Shirley) austin? - Y eah. I need to get off by 6 tonight. Not tonight, shirley. I need you for inventory. Please, austin. Please. - I got tickets to summer jam. - Thank you. No way. Shirley) That's messed up. See, I wouldn't do you like that. Y es, you would. Y ou're doing it right now by trying to duck out on inventory. Shirley) Just evil. Hello. Hi. Hey. Fancy meeting you here. Nervous laugh) So this is your regular gig. Huh? Oh, yeah. Y eah. Hey, gotta eat. Um... can I ask you a question? Y eah. Um... are... are you and my dad, like, a thing? I'm sorry, I don't know what... come on, austin. Don't make this any harder than it already is. Are you and my dad dating? I think, uh, this is a conversation you should be having with your father. I don't know how to talk to him. He's so closed off to me. Rhonda, I don't think now is a good time. When will be a good time? After he moves you in? Y ou know he'll never admit this to me. He will, when he's ready. So, has... he always been gay? I don't know much more than you do. Has he slept with you? Wow. Okay. Are you all right? No, I'm not all right. Thank you, austin. I'm sorry, I didn't... oh, that... lt's okay. It's okay. - Doorbell dings) - I have to go to lunch. I was afraid you didn't get my message. Why did you tell rhonda I was gay? What? I didn't say that. What did you say? Robert, she came in the store and confronted me. It was like she already knew. No she suspected. She didn't know. I'm sorry. I mean, what was I supposed to say? Lie! Shit! Now I'm fucked! - She just needs some time. - Look, you don't have children, okay? She's never gonna look at me the same. All she's gonna do is think about what I do. What we do. Y ou embarrassed of us? My daughters love and respect... is all that matters to me. Why did you do this to me? What happened to one step at a time? This wasn't premeditated. It was never my intention to... y ou know, you're immature. Y ou think like a child. What the hell was I thinking, huh? That's why I don't mess with faggoty-ass queens like you. Y ou run your mouth like a bitch. Okay. Y ou can leave now. Good. It's over. Do you want some company? I think we should talk. Can't even find the words to say. Just say it. Y ou don't get to tell me what to do. How long have you had this? Jesus, you make it sound like it's a disease. It's not something you can catch, rhonda. How long? My whole life, I guess. I am so stupid. I always thought you never had another woman after mom, because you still had feelings for her. I felt sorry for you. Do you have any idea what it's like for me? Did you ever stop to think about what I'm going through? What about me, dad. I always considered you. That's why I lied. I lied to protect you. No, you lied to protect yourself. If that's true, then why don't you just say, "It's okay, dad. I accept you"? Because it's not okay. It's not that I have a problem with gays, it's the fact my dad is. Well, this is who I am, rhonda. I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. ...I'm fightin' hard to find... ...the words to say... ...I've been so lost... I'm trying... ...to find my way... ...'cause I am a man... ...I am a man... ...I am a tree... ...rooted in sorrow... ...grounded in pain... ...so tragic in ways... ...but I am a smile... ...waiting for laughter... ...waiting for someone... ...I've yet to be... ...don't wanna feel like you... ...might be too late... ...I'm fighting hard to find... ...the road to take... ...fades) Shirley) I didn't really miss much at summer jam. And you're lucky. I didn't go. Because we spent the whole time driving around trying to find parking, so... austin) Y ou weren't gonna go anyway. - Y eah, whatever. - Just put it there. I wanna go home. - There. - Shirley, that's uneven. It's not gonna stay up there. Y ou do it. Y ou need to stop building these lawsuit displays. I'm exorcising my demons. And I don't remember asking you for an opinion. Oh, no, no, no. See, not an opinion. Cause the next time some fool comes in here and reaches for a bottle of echinacea, it's gonna be murder she wrote. Y ou need to listen to what I have to say. She does have a point. I've got the bruises to prove it. - Robert. - I was gonna call you... oh, it's cool. I understand. I'm over it all. Really. ...about the voucher. The protein plus. Oh, um... we don't have them in stock yet. I decided I didn't want the protein plus anymore. I was wondering if I could switch it for something else. - Like what? - Y ou. Shirley) Oh! Hell, no! Coming up in here with that okey-doke mess. - No! Uh-uh! What? - Shirley... y ou think somebody's supposed to take your mess... - what? - Calm down. Scoffs) Man, I have work to do. So, if you don't mind... can I have another chance? Can we try again? I don't think so. Okay, um... I thought I would just give it a try. - Good riddance. - Shirley, mind your own business. Y ou never said you were sorry. Y ou can't tell? I need you to say it. I'm sorry for saying for what I said. I was stupid and upset, 'cause I wasn't man enough to admit what is so obvious. What's that? That I'm falling in love with you. And I don't care who knows. Dude, I think you might be gay. Chuckles) ...y ou most certainly have been made for me... strange. ...so glad finally love's callin'... williams) Robert discovered that, when it came down to a choice between the real thing and the generic, though the generic is cheaper, more accessible, it has no identity. It was always be a blue label. It never works as well, tastes as good or measure up to the real thing. ...y ou most certainly have been made for me... ...so glad finally love's callin'... ...feels so heavenly fallin' down on me... ...this time, he's definitely receiving... closed-captioned by j.r.
