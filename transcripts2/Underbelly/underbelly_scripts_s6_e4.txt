 Mr Brophy, I want to get us back on an even keel, you know... Huh? Back to normal. What're doing here, anyway? Hobnobbing with the rich and famous, my friend. - This place ain't so special. - Are you kidding? I'd sell my soul to have a place like this. You are a sight for sore eyes. Come here. You OK? You all in one piece? You look good! - What's your name? - Lorna Kelly. - What's yours? - You don't know? I'm not like other girls, Les.

 You're not taking advantage. I would never do that. Les is my fella, but he's also a pickpocket, a sly grogger and my pimp. No, I don't believe you. We love each other and we're getting married and I'm having his baby. So I've got your blessing? Oh, a million times over. You two are a match made in heaven. We're gonna start a war between Long Harry and Stokes. And then we'll take over this town. The Fitzroy Vendetta was over. Long Harry Slater refused to testify against Henry Stokes.

 Released on bail, he fled to Sidney. Stokes was found guilty of discharging firearm in public. His six-month sentence was suspended, provided he too leave the state of Victoria. So Henry and his wife packed up their belongings and sailed back to Tasmania. And who did he leave in charge of his empire? You guessed it. Would you like to choose a fabric now, Mr Taylor? Yeah, I'm fond of something with a stripe, Leo. - Makes a man look... - Taller. Oh, Mr Taylor, sorry, I meant no disrespect... Makes a man look more powerful, Leo. Yes, Mr Taylor, it does. "Happy is the man who findeth wisdom." "Happy is the man who findeth himself boss and awash with the shitload of dosh", says I. I'm king of the castle. And all the dirty rascals out there are doing my bidding. God bless them all. Trust you're having a good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Your Honour, what a pleasure to meet you. Come here, we'll have a photo. From here on in, it's only the finest for me. Finest food, clothes, cars, house... The best of everything. Let's get four champagnes for these lads, on the house. Thank you. Who knows what's around the corner? War, Spanish flu... There could even be a bullet with my name on it. What's Lady Luck's maiden name? Well, it's Miss Fortune, of course! "From here on in,...  live in clover... 'cause when you're dead,... you're dead all over..." Stokes wants an update on our financial situation. - What are you gonna tell him? - That we're going great guns. Just had a few out-of-pocket expenses. Like the new car, the parties and the clothes? I've to worry about Stokes - he's not back for months. And when he does come back, I'm gonna have the jacks so far up his arse,  they'll be brushing his teeth. After all, it's the hottest betting club in town. - What about Stokes's boys? - Well... Boss, we got a problem. Caught him red-handed with a pocket full of aces. No-one likes a cheat, Cecil. - I wasn't cheating, Mr Taylor. - Shut the fuck up! Shh, shh, shh, shh. Now, I could give you a stern warning and let you go. Thank you, Mr... But then that would make me look weak as piss. And for someone in my position, that's a dangerous thing. No! Ungh! So I'm gonna make sure the whole of Melbourne knows how I deal with cheats. Ungh! Hello? Thank you. Les. Les! You're having a baby. Hello. It's a girl. Say hello to your daughter. Hello, tiny! Of course she's tiny! She felt big enough coming out. Les, she looks like you. Come here, darlin'. My baby girl. Oh! Hey? You're Daddy's girl, are you? Call her June, what do you reckon? That's lovely. Oh, my baby. ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra-lai ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-la-lai ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra-lai ♪ Hush now, don't you cry. ♪ She wants what you can give her, Les. I'm gonna give her the world, Ma. Then you'd better grow a couple of breasts quick smart and give her a feed - she's hungry. Now, Leslie, two things. She tore downstairs a bit so she's going to need some time to mend, you understand? - What's that got to do with it, ma? - I know men have certain needs. so you'll have to do "the washing" by hand until she's better. I don't do "the washing". Well, you will now, young man if you want to "get the dirty water" off your chest. - Do you understand? - Yeah, I do, yeah, yep. Good. Come on. It's time to step up, provide a roof over your family's head. You're a good boy. I know you'll make your mother proud. Mind your step. - How can we possibly afford a place like this? - Oh, you don't have to worry about that, Lorn. - But I do worry, Les. - Well, don't. Come on. It's a man's job to be the breadwinner, right? It's his job to do whatever he has to do to put food on the table and keep a roof over the head of his wife and kids. None of her business how he does it... Just like it's none of his business if Monday night's corned beef or shepherd's pie. The way I see it, marriage is about supporting each other through thick and thin, and not asking stupid bloody questions that are just likely to upset me. Yes! Yes! You're short. We had to cut back on some expenses. Les hopes you understand. You're getting sleepy, very sleepy. - More hocus-pocus, Fred. - "Science", John. - It's the future. - It's not my future, mate. Want to do yourself a favour? Turn up the heat on the Stokes place in Richmond. Give that little turd Squizzy some grief. Last time I did that I copped a kick in the balls for my trouble. I reckon he's got friends in high places. Not anymore, he doesn't. Smile for the birdie. This is the police! Nobody move! Stay where you are! You're under arrest, little man. - You can't do this to me. - Can't I? - Do you know who I am? - You're Squizzy Taylor. A jumped-up shrimp. A nobody. I'm the fucking King of Melbourne. You're the King of Nowhere, mate. He got off with a fine. Maybe now's the time to get an honest job. Don't you want your daughter to grow up proud of her dad? I manage a high-class establishment. You sell sly grog and run an illegal gambling house. You've just been beaten up and arrested, for goodness sake. If you saw the number of lawyers and judges you'll come to my club for a drink in a flutter. Doesn't make it right, Les. And since when is it your club? Where's June? I should have been there. Hello, darlin'. Oh, hello, darlin'. Hey? Hello, June. How are you? My little girl, huh? How's my little girl? Look at you, princess. Taylor! Where are you, you little squirt? Come here. Bruce is his own man. Well, then what am I paying you for? - You're getting a "Flood Day" in the court, turn two. - I shouldn't be in the courts, Jack. I wouldn't be complaining if I was you. You've only got yourself to blame. Hey! So you didn't get a good look at the bomber? No. First concern was for my wife and family. Of course. Where are they now? Winnie's taken the children to her sister's. Your wife, she said she saw someone lurking around the place earlier on. Yes, but I've already spoken to her. She can't identify him. The bomb was apparently a tin packed with gelignite and nuts and bolts. Anyone hurt? Miraculously, no. Heard the blast from my place. How much damage? Detective Bruce's place was blown to bits. Fuckin' hell. When might I get a chance to talk to your wife? I just told you - she cannot identify him. Not consciously, but I'd like to try to put her under hypnotic trance. Jesus! Look, Brophy, the Bureau of Investigation in the United States has had great success in the area. We need evidence, witnesses. We could always try the old-fashioned way. Bust a few heads instead of trying to get inside 'em. Oh, we were at a temperance meeting until ten and then we came home and went to bed. "Temperance meeting"? Amazing the roof didn't fall in. What about after that, around one o'clock this morning? Oh, well, now you've got me there, detective. - I was up and about. - Doing? Making a bomb, of course, to blow you and your- - loved ones to bits! Les! You shouldn't say such wicked things. - And that's what he's accusing me of. - I can vouch for my husband, detective. I was up feeding June, our baby daughter. - Les got up and made me a cuppa. - Dutiful husband, that I am. I looked at the clock. It was about ten after one. Thank you, Mrs Taylor. I'm just glad to hear your family is safe, detective. It must be terribly distressing for your wife. Yes, it is. You're gonna have to pull your head in, sunshine. He's not going to intimidate me. - Now listen, Jim. - No, you listen. - Mate... - No, you listen! My wife's sister gave me a white feather during the war for not enlisting. She's a stupid cow 'cause you're a copper. - Essential service. - Doesn't matter. Not when every other man in the family went off to fight. Her husband, her son. I keep that with me as a reminder for how important it is for me to do my duty as a police officer. That's very noble. Now, what about the safety of your wife and kids? Does that come first? I think you should get off gambling and sly grog for a while, take on other jobs. You can still be a good copper. Do it for them. Oh, bugger me, I've left my bloody hat in there. Think about what I said, Jim. I'm heading out, Lorn. I won't be long, alright? Now, you listen to me, you little turd. You do not send blokes with bombs around to coppers' houses. You do not make threats to coppers' families. Is that understood? - Is he gonna back off? He is...for now. - Then we're apples. - No, we're not apples. Any arrangement we've had is over, finished. What, are you trying to squeeze me another fiver, Brophy? - You filthy mongrel! - Just try it, Jack. I've dropped bigger blokes than you. Les. Just forgot my hat, Mrs Taylor. Good day to you. What? Forgot his hat. Seriously, what's his problem? Huh? If we were going to kill him we woulda used a bigger bomb. He's a cop, Tank. You can't expect him to use his brains. Someone's here. - Put your hands in the air! - What the fuck's been going on?! Henry, why didn't you tell me you were coming back? You've had your hand in the till. I ought to blow your little tits off. Oh, from where I'm standing, looks like Tank and I have got you outgunned. Not from where I'm standing. Alright. Alright, come on. Fine, let me explain. Don't try talk your way out of it, you little shit! Henry, come on. Get out of my sight before I blow you fucking balls. Get out! And don't think this is over for one moment, it's not! I've never seen you handle a gun like that before. No. - I thought you'd like that. - I certainly did. What are we gonna do, Les? Les! Fuck it. You know I was gonna shoot them. Alright. You got every reason to be angry at me. - Let me have it. - What? - Hit me. - What?! Hit me. Annie, you pack quite a punch. Fuck! Thank you. You've got no idea what it's been like, Henry. Bruce is been giving us a furious talk. - That prick. - We bombed his house. Who thought that was a good idea? - It was risky, but... - You bring all the Jackson Melvin down on him...you idiots! No, Bruce is gonna back off for the good of his family. It's a win, Henry. So what, you go and buy yourself a big new house, a flash new car, all with my money? Yes, I did, because, mate, I'm representing you, alright? I had to look the part. - Didn't expect us back early? - I can't say I did, Annie. You think I'd give you time to organise a welcome home party? Come on, Henry. I didn't get to where I am by being outsmarted by the likes of you, Les. You've got me all wrong. But, a welcome home party sounds like a cracker of an idea. I'd like to have you two as the guests of honour at a big, lavish do, at my place. Just to show you how much you've been missed. As long as it's with your money, not mine. Ha. Very funny. What do you say? Fuck Henry Stokes! I'm sick of that place anyway. Those boys like having their boss back. Yeah, dumb pricks. He gave 'em bonuses to keep 'em staunch. Now, um, what do you want me to do with these photographs? Tank, we're destined for bigger things. Much bigger things. Look out, you bastards. Now, I want you to relax, Winifred. Just breathe in and breathe out. You're getting sleepy. You can hardly keep your eyes open. You're falling into a deep, deep sleep. Is she, um... I do believe she is. Good Lord, I've done it. Winifred, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. I'm taking you back. You saw a man outside your home on the evening of the bombing. - Do you remember him? - Yes. Excellent. Now I want you to describe him to me. Every last detail. He was a tall man with blond hair... Oh. - Sorry for the intrusion. - What happened?! How's the hocus-pocus coming along, Fred? We're going to have to begin again. - No. I didn't like it. - Please, Mrs Bruce. You were just about to give us a description of the bomber. No, I don't think it's proper for a Christian lady. - I'm leaving. - Sorry, Fred. Never would have held up in court anyway, Fred. Christ, it's dark in here! Well, there's Archer's, McIntosh and the railyards. It's easier to move and harder to trace than the good stuff. It's like spun fuckin' gold. - We're off. - You are? Oh, you have a good day, my darlin'. Hey? You be a good girl for Mummy, won't you? She's always a good girl, Dad. - You have a good day too. - We will. - Bye, Bert. - Bye. Mum's in a good mood. Yeah, I told her I'd start looking for a legit job. Really? Oh, an honest job. What I'd do, I'd probably become a watchmaker. I'd really love to do that. Tank, I said I'll do it, because it's much you wanna to hear. Rightio, so you're not seriously, you know, really thinking about it? Well, I actually did for a bit. But then, I'd rather kill my self than live a boring life. Now,... I have to say, I love a nice piece of fabric. chinese silk, a lovely bit of Crepe de Chine, even a yard of quality tweed gets me going. It all started when I was a babe in arms, I suppose. I can still remember me mum giving me a scrap of crush velvet to play with to keep me quiet. We've got a partial handprint taken from the railyard robbery. What's that supposed to tell us, that one of our crooks has at least one hand? The size of the print would indicate that the thief was of diminutive stature. - Let's drag him in. - Hang on, hang on. - What more do you want? - A whole lot bloody more! So one of our crooks is a short-arse. So what? Could be Squizzy. Might be a kid. I know a hundred kids that'd fit that bill. - It's Squizzy Taylor. - What if it's a sheila? It's not a bloody woman, it's Squizzy Taylor. Didn't you hear him? There is nothing I'd like more than to lock him up for keeps. But he has no form in warehouse robberies. Who's to say he's not broadening his horizons, Brophy? I say we take a harder look at him. Good luck. I've got a very urgent appointment at the pub. Of course you do! - How do I look? - Peachy. Jacks! Run for it! No, Ed, you can't leave me... Shit! Looks like we've found lovers' lane, Frank. Finish up there and move along. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Come on. That's all I could think of. I will make it up to you. I will take you out for a hundred fancy dinners to a hundred beautiful restaurants. You poor, sweet, stupid little girl! We can do whatever your lovely heart desires. Hi, Lorna. - Is everything alright? - They asked me to leave. What? What, the temperance people? Why? There was a story about you in this afternoon's paper. - Have you seen it? - No. God, look at that photo. That's awful. That's why they asked me to leave, you bastard! Lorna, come on. You said you'd given all of that up. I said I wasn't running Stokes' place anymore. But you've got a respectable job now. Which unfortunately doesn't pay as well. What about what's right? What about doing what's right for me and June? I've lost my friends! I've lost all of my friends! You've got plenty of friends. We're having a party here Friday night. You're going to make plenty of new ones. - I won't come down. - Yes, you will. - No, I won't. - You will. That's the end of it. We've got to put on a good turn for the Stokes, otherwise it's going to end very badly. - And what does that mean? - Just what I said. I've seen the way that woman looks at you, and it's not decent! You're imagining things, Lorna. Hey, get my scrapbook! Gotta hand it to you, Les. You've gone to a lot of trouble. Oh, nothing's too much for you, Henry. So have you had any more trouble from the jacks lately? - No. - Good. Good, I'm glad to hear. So we're back to business partners? Partners, Les. With 50% discount on the grog supply until you've paid your debt. That sounds fair and equitable, doesn't it? Did you just check Justice O'Toole fondling that girl? Wouldn't have thought this was to your wife's taste, Les. Oh, no, you'd be surprised. Where is she anyway?  Out banging the temperance drum? No, no. She's having a lie-down upstairs. - Oh, not the flu, I hope? - No, no, nothing contagious. Oh, a migraine. - I'm gonna get another one of these. Why has..oh! Grapes! - I should top up. I'll be back. Lorna, it's only me, Bert. - Can I come in? - Yes. Les, he, um... he asked me to come up and see how you were. He couldn't come himself? He's in the middle of things. Being a host with the most, and everything. - Course he is. - I brought you some brandy. - I don't drink. - I know. It's, um, for medicinal purposes, you know. Bert. Annie. You're missing the show. Oh, well, some like to watch. Some have other preferences. Hmm. Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself. Oh, I'm having a ball. When I met Les, I had no idea who he was or what he did. I know. S..See, I-I just want him to be a better person. He is the truest mate I've ever had. - He's a criminal! - I'm a criminal. If you grew up where we grew up... ...you'd do whatever you had to do to get out. Tell Les I won't be down this evening. I hope you feel better soon. Thanks, Bert. Lorna? Everyone's missing you. Well, I'm missing you. Come down with me. - You look flushed. - Oh, I am. I've been running around like a blue-arsed fly. You should see it down there. It looks spectacular. It's like a Roman palace. Oh. No, it's... it's very sophisticated. It's all the rage in Europe. And they're a very posh crowd. Come on, come downstairs with me. And I promise you from the bottom of my heart... that I will be a better man. Alright? Oh, me God! Haute Art-istic! Hurrah! Is your headache better, dear? Much better, thank you. Well done! Thank you so much. That was wonderful. Look, I'm not one for speechifying, but... But I'd actually like to make a very public welcome home to my dear friends, Henry and Annie Stokes. And I'd like to present them... just to show my boundless affection and high esteem for you both. Raymond, let's get a photo in here Those coats have been in our family for generations. You're telling me these weren't given to you by Squizzy Taylor? I put it to you they were stolen from Edward Love and Company, Chapel Street, South Yarra, three nights ago. - Pig's arse. - Prove it. I have every intention of doing just that. Bloody Piggott. Who'd have thought? You should have, you show pony! You've got to admit, Henry, it was a lovely photograph. What's the idea of giving us stolen property in the first place? It was quality merchandise, which I'll happily replace. - With a mink. - With a mink, yeah. Oh, we should have given you up. I'm very grateful that you didn't. We didn't because I want to kill you myself. Boys! Stop it! Les is gonna fix this, aren't you, Les? - You have my word. - Yeah? How? Just... just leave it with me, alright? Ashtray. Here it is. Scheduled for two days. Justices of the Peace: Tatnall, Kelley and Whitney. "Eenie, meanie, miney, mo," "Catch a nigger by the toe, If he moves, let him go," "Eenie, meanie, miney, mo." Hello, Mr George Whitney. He's a chalkie at the university. He teaches the classics: Latin, Greek... Yeah, I know what the classics are. Go on. He lives in one of them colleges there... - With his family? - No family. Goes to church every Sunday, doesn't drink, doesn't even have a honey. Well, there must be something, Tank. - What does he do for fun? - Fun? Goes to the pictures every Saturday night. With.. these young men, his students. And they go for coffee afterwards at Tate's. What? Tate's on Collins Street? Yeah. Well, it's quite appropriate that he teaches Greek, then, isn't it? Are you alright? Here, let me help. - Oh, that's very kind of you. - Not at all. My name's Daniel, by the way. I don't know how blokes like George Whitney can look at themselves in the mirror. Poor bastards ought to be drowned at birth, I reckon. Gives me a funny feeling knowing I arranged the whole affair. I've made him fall in love. Sorry, that seat's taken. It's taken by me, George.... and so were these. "Georgie Porgie, puddin' and pie," "kissed the girls and made them cry." But you're not likely to be kissing any girls, are you, Georgie? You bastard. Will the defendants rise? In the matter of the Crown versus Harold Stokes and Anne Charlotte Stokes, we find the defendants guilty. However, as this was not a unanimous decision of the bench - God only knows why - the penalty imposed will not be as severe as it otherwise might have been. Henry Stokes, you are hereby fined £25. Anne Charlotte Stokes, you are fined £5. Court is adjourned. What is going on here, Pat? A bloody fine! Stokes and his missus get away with a bloody fine. Thought you had a watertight case. Goods in custody. Well, obviously Stokes has nobbled the bench. - That, or Taylor has. - What, bribed the whole bench? It only takes one bad apple to ruin everything for us, James. We just let them get away with anything now? Bombing houses, corrupting judges? The problem with you, blokes, is you play by the rules then you look surprised when you get a kick in the nuts. What about you, eh? What about your arrest record? Meaning? You've never laid a glove on Taylor. Why is that, Jack? Why are you protecting him? I'll bring him down before you do, don't worry about that. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah, that's right. I'll do it my way, and when I do, I'll stick him up your sanctimonious arses. I want a couple of bubble number three-in-the-fifths. Bugger off, Brophy! What if I got my bookmaking ticket? Would you see yourself as my penciller? - You serious? - Nah, probably not. Hey, I tell you, Royal Order, what do you reckon? - She runs well in the wet. - Meh...it's one pair of trippin'. - Hey, put a fiver on for me. - On the nose. You're nicked, Squizzy. Alright, Jacko, very funny. How much? - What, ten quid? - You're not going anywhere. 20 quid! I'm charging you, you little pipsqueak, so shut the fuck up! No, I'm gonna be bailed in an hour and be back to the track by lunch. Not if I can't find a bail justice in a hurry, you won't. You're a bastard. You're a bastard! Lorn? By the beginning of 1921, the Spanish flu epidemic was, by and large, considered to have passed. There were, however, still the occasional victims, and June Lorraine Taylor, aged seven months, was one of the last to succumb. She's dead, Les. Our little girl is dead. Oh! Les! Les! ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-lai ♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ♪ Hush, now don't you cry. ♪ Where were you? Where were you when we needed you?! When June needed you! Where were you?!
