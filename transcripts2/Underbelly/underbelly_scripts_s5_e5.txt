 Underbelly (2008–2013): Season 5, Episode 5 - Troubleshooting - full transcript 
 Of course paranoid Anthony notices the heat and, ironically, it's the ensuing harassment he heaps on Robbie about not talking to the cops that leads Robbie to agree to making a statement ...

 You're cool if I just leave? Yeah, you done a good job, mate. You bloody little beauty! Two choices: 1. Let him run while we keep on building a brief strong enough to put him away, or 2. Pick him up on an unrelated charge, put him on hold. Let the dog off. Muzz! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Drop it! Get down! Anthony Perish? Yeah? Federal Organised Crime Authority.

 You're holding a summons. We cannot over-emphasise the importance of our Informant X. That's Frank O'Rourke? We can't afford Perish to know he's given us a statement. Do you know a man named Frank Xavier O'Rourke? Don't think so, no. Jesus F... You wanna do a life sentence on account of Terry Falconer? Tink's gotta go, mate, 'cause without him, Tuno's got nothing. Tuno's not exactly... it's not exactly dead. Brownie'll take carriage of the Falconer matter while he's...he's doing other stuff. That's the other news. I'm rotating you out of Homicide.

 What?! SONG: # It's a jungle out there ♪ It's a jungle out there ♪ It's a jungle out there. ♪ MAN: You know, I'm not supposed to do this, but... I have brand-new floor mats in my office, still in the packet, OK? So, what if I throw those in with the three years free car wash? Then would you be happy to close the deal? OK, yeah. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Hey, um, just head inside. And I'll be right in with the paperwork. - Lovely. Thank you so much. - Ok. No problem. G'day, mate. Seen something you like or just taking a look? This one been in an accident? Uh, well, there's no chassis damage, mate. There's definitely been a repaint on that panel, but that could just be from the car being keyed. You looking for yourself, for someone else? What are you asking for the Merc in the corner? Uh...do you wanna take a look? It's a beautiful car. Nah, I said, "What's it going for?" OK, well, it's a 1980 convertible, pristine condition. Couldn't let it go for less than 20. Yeah, alright. Done. Sorry, I didn't catch your name. I'm Ben Dokic. I'm the owner here. Steve Wilson. Congratulations, Steve. You know, you and I, we just set a record for the world's fastest car deal. Oh, is that right? That is right, yeah. Hey, you wanna come inside? We can sort out the deposit. You want a cup of tea? Coffee? Would you like a beer, Steve? No, I'll have to take a raincheck on the beer, mate. There you go. Is that gonna work for you? Cheers, Steve. Sweet as. Sweet as. Alright. Thanks, Steve. See ya. Despite his 1992 drug charges being withdrawn, Anthony Perish was still feeling the heat. He didn't know Strike Force Tuno had been put on hold. He was convinced he was their prime suspect for the murder of Terry Falconer. Buying a Saab? Nuh. And if someone as staunch as biker Frank O'Rourke had talked to Tuno, what was stopping others? Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're not after you. G'day, mate. Mate. Meet us at the pub around the corner. OK. Cool. I need you to pull in Decker. Find out if those ballbags at FOCA have summonsed him as well. MUZZ: You reckon it might be a problem? Well, if Frank can turn... G'day. Ben Dokic. Hey, you know, if you guys had given me your address, I could have dropped it off at your house. Well, if I'd given you me address, I would have had to fuckin' kill ya. OK. I'll, uh...I'll get us a round. He's a clown. He doesn't dress like one, but. Oi, Decker's the one I'm worried about. And he took me gun. Where you goin'? I saved you a seat. Do I know you? No. But, uh, I can show you the time of your life, so what does it matter, eh? Gotta get back to work. You fucking cockblocker. She is very friendly. Here we go, guys. Oh, almost forgot. Your new car. She's a glamour. Oh, sweet. I'll go find Decker, will I? For the car. You like speed? Yeah. Anthony had just found himself a new playmate. I guess that's what bored, rich, mischievous gangsters do to fill in their days. What do you feel like? Feel like a red or a white? Yeah, maybe a white. Just, uh, pick a nice one, babe. Just gotta make a quick call. You look like a stick of spearmint gum. What are you doing here? Our mate wants to see ya. What for? I didn't ask. Look, I just can't disappear again. I've got a new life now. I... I hereby quit the company. Well, you can quit when you're dead. Oh, and he wants his gun back. The rules of the underworld may seem strange to the honest citizen. If you know a man is up to serious badness and you choose to distance yourself from him, he'll naturally assume you've turned informant - you're "dogging" him - and he'll come after you. Mate! Long time no see. New wheels. Where's me gun? Is it loaded? No. Stop looking so worried, then. Now, about the money you owe me. Oh, mate, happy to pay it back any way I can. That's what I like to hear. Come on, mate. You look like you need a drink. See, the trick is to isolate their objections. So, if they say to you, "Oh, you know, it's only got one key" or "The tyres are a bit bald," you say, "OK, so, apart from the bald tyres and the one key, "is there anything else stopping us doing business today?" You know, car salesmen, notoriously good at picking up chicks. It's having the gift of the gab, mate. Is that right, eh? Yeah. 100 bucks says you can't get 'em over here. Done. So, someone's been talking, mate... ..about Falconer. Mate, you know me and my boys are staunch. No, it's not just the cops. It's FOCA. What's FOCA? They're like cops, with more power. Spook people into talking with a two-year jail term. Shit. So, what, someone's given 'em a statement? Yeah, Frank O'Rourke. He's a bloody lunatic, so it's not much. But the last thing I need is someone filling in the gaps, eh? If there's anyone who could put me away for a long time, it's you, mate. Just remember. It was your car. You were the last one seen with Falconer alive. Hey, I hope you guys don't mind if Shannon, Kate and Lisa join us. No, course not. G'day, ladies. Hi. Hello. So, maybe we should take this party somewhere, uh, a little more private? Yeah, youse girls got any plans for the weekend? No, not really. Good. Are youse three sisters? You got a problem with the clubs in Sydney? What - you got a problem with the clubs on the Gold Coast? How are ya, mate? All good? All good, yeah. Hey, he knows the owner? He IS the owner. Anthony Perish laundered his massive drug profits through clubs and pubs up and down the Queensland coast. So, what is it you do again? You could say I fix problems. OK. Could you be a little more specific? I work in security. So you're a bouncer? No. Man, you must have to deal with a lot of shitheads in your line of work. Look, when Rooster has a problem, I fix it. Rooster! Rooster...? Anthony. Anthony...? Our mate. What, you mean Steve? Yeah. Oh, mate, your ears must be burning. Oh, yeah? We were just talkin' about how Decker takes care of all your problems. Rooster! Boy, am I gonna be in the doghouse when I get home. No, Jodes and I take turns. You know, she stays home with Blakey and I get the nights off, and then I look after Blake, she has a girls' night out. You ever go out together? Not if I wanna have fun. Fair call. Oh, ho, ho! Missy Higgins! It's my fiancee's. It's your fiancee's. You have no idea who you're talking to, mate. Alright, Tarzan. And watch what you say around our mate. Last person who crossed him ended up in pieces. What? I kidnapped the bloke. Saw it happen. Well, what do you mean, pieces? I mean they had to fish him out of the river in seven different bags. Look, I just tell you this as a warning, alright? You get in too deep with him, you'll never get out. You mad at me? Oh, babe, it was only supposed to be a night out. It's a really important client... You've been gone all weekend with your phone off. Yeah, I sent you a text. So? What do you have to tell me? What do you mean? If you messing around with some cheap skank, tell me now, not in six months time, when you're feeling all depressed and expect me to make you feel better. When are you gonna let that go? When you stop making it an issue. Hi, Dad. Hey, look at you, Blakey. How'd you get so dirty? Playing in the mud. Oh, yeah? What's that you got? A Ferrari. Yeah? Reckon we've got some of those at work? Yes. Yeah, do ya? Yep. We'll try to. Should we clean you up? Should we clean you up? Yes. Should we clean you up? Yes. Shit! Oh, fuck. Fuck. Oi, someone's poisoned me dog. What? Yeah, she's eating like a horse, dragging her arse all over the carpet. Someone's been in me house and poisoned her. Maybe she's got worms. Oh, you reckon? Well, who's gonna break into your house and poison your dog? I mean, did they take anything? Well... ..get me some bloody anti-wormer, then. Alright, 'bye. Fuckin' idiot. Yeah, night. See ya. See ya. G'day, mate. Oh, Steve, mate. What are you doing here? You, uh, always close up on your own? Yeah, mainly. Yeah? Yeah. What were you and Decker talking about the other night? When? Hey, hey, hey. He tell you anything memorable? Hey, no. Hey, mate, what's happened? Nah, nothin'. It's all good. Let's go to the pub, eh? Come on, mate. You're me wingman. How's work? Is it all good? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, you could open more nightclubs. But maybe there's another market to exploit. You could buy a restaurant or a winery. You know, diversify. Yeah, a winery sounds good. Well, I spent last Easter up at Mudgee. Really good cab sav and shiraz. You like red? Did you say Mudgee? Yeah, not too far from Sydney. Why Mudgee? It's nice. No, no, why really? I don't know. 'Cause I've been there. Just came to me. How'd you know I got a property up at Mudgee? I didn't. You been in me house, have ya? Looked through me stuff? How else would ya fuckin' know? Look, mate. I don't know what you're talking about. It's just a coincidence. You're not playing with a full deck, are ya, mate? You know I'm not. Oh, mate, you are too much fuckin' fun. Eh? Mmm. My round, alright? What the fuck you lookin' at? You had eyes on Perish? Where's he holed up now? We don't know. He's a master of anti-surveillance. This bloke, Ben Dokic - used-car salesman with no criminal record, no links to drugs, bikies. What's he doing with Perish if he's a cleanskin? He seems pretty subservient. Maybe he was one of the Falconer kidnappers. Bit of a long shot. Well, we're bringing him in for a chat, so that's something. Meanwhile, what have you guys got? How about I serve the summons, suss the guy out? Fine. Less work for us. And I'm bringing Inspector Jubelin to the hearing. Oh, "Angriest Man Alive". Terrence Falconer? Look, I've never even heard of a Terrence Falconer, Mr, uh... Browne. Detective Sergeant Browne. Mr Dokic, I wouldn't be here unless I thought you could help in some way. What would I know? I'm just a car salesman. Well, if you think there's someone else we should be talking to, I'm all ears. No. Jesus fuckin' Christ. Hi. Hi. Boy, are these shoes killing me. Mwah! Got just about everything on the list, though. Hey, what's wrong? Nothin' at all. I didn't know anything about the whole Falconer thing until you guys summonsed me here. You never had cause to talk with Anthony Perish about the abduction of Terry Falconer, his murder and the disposal of his remains? He told me his name was Steve Wilson. An alias? But doesn't the fact that Mr Wilson paid up-front, in cash, for a $20,000 vehicle suggest a certain level of criminality to you? I sold him a car. We had a beer. Whatever he's done, he didn't tell me anything about it. He's shittin' himself. He knows something. Reckon we can bounce him? Let's see what happens after this first. If we ever find one, we'll kill ya. So, they didn't ask about Decker? No, they just kept asking about Falconer - who killed him, what I knew. Well, what do you know? Just what I've read online. He was kidnapped by three men from his work. They found his body in a river. And? And that he'd been dismembered. Yeah, we sawed him to pieces. So, they were asking you who did it, like they didn't know? Yeah. Look, mate, having cops come round work, it's bad for business. What'd you tell 'em about me? That I knew you as Steve Wilson. That I sold you a car. That we had beers together. That's all. Yeah, alright. Go on, get outta here. Go on, piss off. Why do you make all these problems? Oh, we'll put eyes on him, alright. Come on, Blakey. We'll let Dad read the paper in peace, hey? OK. "Absence makes the heart grow fonder", right? Bye. See ya, Blakey. Ben Dokic. Hey, you bastard. Hello? It's Decker. G'day, mate. How are ya? Hey, come down to Lavender Bay Cafe. I'm here. Oh, you're there, are you? G'day, mate. How are ya? G'day, fellas. This place any good? Yeah. Yeah, good coffee. Oh, yeah? Was that your wife? Guys, I didn't tell them anything, and I'm not going to. Yeah, I reckon you're lyin'. What do you reckon, Decker? Can't you look us in the eye? Shall we tell him? Yeah, let's tell him. We did it. Did what? Killed Falconer. Me and Muzz. That's bullshit. Decker was one of the kidnappers. And you bought the van. No, I didn't. No, I think you did. No? What's this? Looks like a receipt for a van to me. Have you been in my office? Say you killed Falconer. Say it. Yeah, I killed Terry Falconer. Oh, mate! That must feel pretty good, getting that off your chest, eh? Or, uh, I don't know, maybe you're feeling a bit down about it, a bit depressed, eh? You ever thought about suicide? Yeah. Jesus. You know, just...just ending it all? Throwing yourself in front of a train. Guys, I don't even know anything. Say, "I'm thinking about jumping in front of a train." Fuckin' say it. "I'm thinking about jumping in front of a train." Wasn't so hard now, was it? Eggs are getting cold. So, you reckon this Dokic guy's worth chasing? I mean, we pull him into FOCA again, we might get the same dumb response. Yeah, but we don't have any other leads, do we? I think there's potential. It's an interesting dynamic. He's his mate and he's shit-scared of him. There's potential here. Best way to get him to talk is put an even bigger scare into him. What's worse than chopping him up? Sarcasm? Don't be a smart-arse, Brownie. I get enough of that at Chatswood. Full force of the law is all I'm saying. It's a bloody big stick. Or we continue with your method - "softly, softly". You're barking up the wrong tree, mate. Another summons. We'd like you to come in again. We can look after you, if that's what you're worried about, Ben. You keep saying you hardly know Perish. That you only just met him. Yeah, I did. Then why are you protecting him? This prick, he wouldn't shout if a shark bit him. And now you expect me to... He's got no morals, no humanity. Gotta stand for something. Our mate wants a word. Yeah, look, just throw 'em one of them, um... Muzz, what's that red fish called? Herring. That's it, one of them. A red herring. Tell 'em, uh...I don't know, a crew from Adelaide killed Falconer. That's perjury. Then go to jail if you have to. I haven't done anything wrong. Ohh, look who doesn't wanna do a line anymore. Oh, fuck, what a wuss. Come on, Muzz. This party's shithouse. You're staying right here. Hey, Ben? What? Yeah, I can't wait to get your sweet, warm blood all over me hands. You hear me?! Look, what are you doing? Think you can fuck me, eh? I'm not fucking with you. Please. Please! I won't say anything. You fuckin' got that right, mate. We're particularly interested in finding out who kidnapped Terry Falconer. Perish made the order, but who were the three men? How should I know? You haven't the faintest idea? No, sorry. Might I remind you of the penalty for contempt of the Authority? I'm here, I'm answering your questions, at risk to my fucking life! I can't tell you what I don't know. He's not protecting him out of loyalty. He knows what they're capable of and he's genuinely packing shit. Have you spoken to him about police protection? Both times I've seen him. Right, we'll give him a deadline. Tell him the offer won't be on the table forever. I don't know what's going on with you these days, I really don't. Ohh! Ohh! Muzz! Oi, Muzz! What's up? Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus! Someone's been in here, poisoning Heidi again. Look. Oh, fuck, it's disgusting. Open up! - It's Undies. - Rooster! Rooster! What's this I hear about some mate of yours talking to FOCA, huh? Some...some cleanskin? Someone's poisoned me bloody dog again. - Is it Decker? - Why would he poison her, eh? Nobody poisoned your fuckin' dog. Hey? I gave it a laxative, just, you know, as a joke. Fuck, Undies! Fuck! You weren't just born stupid. You stayed that way. Yeah, well, I'm not the one bragging to some car salesman about doing Falconer, huh? Hey, who told you that? Look, we can't get to Tink, alright? And this mate of yours, he's not connected, so use him to send a message to Tink and to Decker. Cops are watching him. I'm not saying YOU do it. I'm saying we need to deal with this guy, this used-car salesman. Yeah, Undies might be right. And what better way for, uh, Decker to prove he's staunch, eh? So, what's it gonna be, Tahns? Pirates? Or gay cowboys? You're the one who says we never watch movies anymore. Tell your wife you're goin' out. Uh, babe, a mate from work's got a flat tyre. Be back in a bit, alright? OK. He gets home around 6:00. Let's take him out to dinner. You want the steak medium rare or well done? Charcoal. Yeah, hey, babe. It's me. Yeah, no, it's been a big day. Yeah, no, I already picked up the cake. OK. OK, see you soon. Yeah, I love you too. Bye. Sorry, baby. Bloody Murph didn't have a spare tyre, so... Won't be too much longer. Love you too. Decker wasn't happy. All he wanted was to get home to his warm bed. Besides, he couldn't be sure Ben Dokic was even coming home that night. So, he came up with plan B. Never let Anthony Perish say Decker lacked initiative. Come on, Blakey, bath time. You said dessert first. Alright, 10 more minutes till Dad gets home, but that's it, OK? Ah! Look who lost his keys again. Daddy! Hi. Fucking Decker. Shit. SONG: # As the night falls ♪ I lie awake for hours ♪ And it won't stop ♪ This buzzing in my eardrums ♪ Like a nightmare ♪ That I cannot seem to wake from ♪ And I recall ♪ There's nothing left here for us... ♪ ♪ We lost control ♪ In the end ♪ It falls apart ♪ In the end ♪ It breaks my heart ♪ In the end ♪ What we've become ♪ In the end ♪ In the end ♪ In the end. ♪ We can arrange protection for you, but we have to know what information you have first. Witness protection, it's a lot of paperwork... Anthony admitted to me he killed Falconer. I know who one of the kidnappers is. You check the security footage for the cafe at Lavender Bay. You'll see him. And I know about his property in Mudgee. So, he reckons Decker was one of the kidnappers? He could have had a hand in the disposal of the body too, but he doesn't know for sure. And is Decker his real surname? He reckons it's just a nickname. What about Perish's confession? It was here, at the cafe. Anthony and Decker were laughing about having killed Falconer and how they were gonna set Ben up for it. "I killed Terry Falconer." Say it. Yeah, "I killed Terry Falconer". Say: "I'm thinking about jumping in front of a train." Fuckin' say it. "I'm thinking about jumping in front of a train". Ben reckons Anthony's going to Mudgee tomorrow. You reckon we can get surveillance? Yep. Oi! Come here. What's your name? Glen Morfoot. You wanna get out of the office, Glen Morfoot? Mm. What's Camille doing these days? I saw her downstairs last week. - She's in the building, definitely. - Well, go get her, Brownie. And, so, a couple of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed cops were sent off to the wine country undercover, in the hope of locating Australia's most wanted man. Like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Do you recognise this man? Has he ever stayed here? Could be using the name Steve Wilson. Possibly. By the way, do you need a credit card to check in? Oh, cash does speak most languages. I don't think so. I'm sorry. Thanks. Any chance of booking a couple of rooms for tonight? Just wait your turn and I'll see. Hi, do you have your driver's licence? Oh, sorry. Oh, that's alright. Bit stiff, are we? Long drive. I keep telling him he needs to do Pilates. You here for the wineries? Yeah, yeah. If you make it to Crosshairs, this one's a beauty. Uh, are youse guys in line? Uh, yeah, yep. Uh, we were hoping to book a room for tonight. Um... Do you accept all credit cards? You're brave not booking ahead in the school holidays. Oh, it was a spur-of-the-moment thing. I thought you lot were trained to do covert surveillance. I mean, isn't that what they teach down in the academy these days? I don't think he twigged. We were so embarrassed. He probably just thought it was a dirty weekend. Anyway, next morning, we waited till he left and we followed him. I hope you didn't rear-end him. No, boss. But the concreter almost did. What? He was leading a concrete truck, but 10 minutes out of town, they turned onto a dirt road and we had to pull back. So you lost him? Don't know where he went? The concreter does. We waited till he came back the other way and waved him down. Apparently, Perish has got a property out here somewhere. Nothing on it except a concrete slab and an excavator. We're thinking there's a cavity underneath the slab. When the concreter backed his truck up, it started sinking and Perish yelled at him to move forward. Reckons he's got a water tank under there. Alright, so he's building a new drug lab. And do we know who owns the property? Not yet. Alright, well, whatever he's up to, it's early days. Alright? So, we need to get in now and set up surveillance. Oh, we didn't see Perish leave. He could still be there. Well, I don't care. This is a golden opportunity. We're not waiting for a written fuckin' invitation. Right? We run into him, we've got no choice. Alright? We take him down. You know, uh... ..they, uh, haven't opened Dokic's shop since... Yeah. Imagine losing your wife and child like that, eh? What's the world coming to? How was Mudgee? You know, I don't know about the place. Got a strange vibe. Got some bloody good vino while I was there, but. Oh, yeah? Mm. What'd you pick up? A cheeky merlot? Bloody oath. Mudgee hasn't exactly delivered yet. So, having engaged surveillance, tactical, one of our Polairs and an X-ray machine, you found exactly nothing at Mudgee? No guns, no drugs? No, I've got surveillance at Perish's new set-up point, which he knows nothing about, and where I'm confident we'll make an arrest. Yeah, about that - we're re-allocating the Terry Falconer brief to a new OIC in Homicide. Well, you can't do that, Howard, 'cause our witnesses won't trust anyone else. We also have a sufficiency of evidence hearing scheduled. We might have enough to arrest Anthony, Andrew and Decker on conspiracy. Fine. Service the Falconer brief from Gangs, but let's have those arrests, eh? "A sufficiency of evidence hearing"? That's the first I've heard about that, Brownie. Me too. I better start making some calls. No shit. I'm sorry, but it's not enough. Dokic's evidence corroborates O'Rourke's, but it's all circumstantial. You need to ID this Decker guy. Then you can make arrests. Thank you. Gary Jubelin had finally got his long-awaited transfer out of Chatswood and back to Major Crime, where he and Tim Browne were both assigned to the Gangs Squad. They promised themselves that some day soon, they would relaunch Strike Force Tuno and bring Anthony John Michael Perish to justice. But first, they had to identify and locate Anthony's lethal accomplice - the man known as Decker. SONG: # In the end. #
