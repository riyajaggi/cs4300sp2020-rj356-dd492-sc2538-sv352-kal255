 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN. Chris: HEY, OUR PLEASURE. SO, TODAY WE HAVE TWO NEW CLIENTS, TIM AND HIS WIFE, CHRIS. THEY BROUGHT IN THEIR 1953 CHEVY 3100. NOW, I CAN TELL THAT THE CAB HAS ALREADY BEEN STRETCHED AND THE BEDSIDES ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER, SO I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THIS TRUCK. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S HAD AN AWESOME START. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING TO DO WITH THE TRUCK? IT'S BEEN IN ONE OTHER SHOP AND HE COULDN'T GET IT DONE IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR US AND I WANT TO DRIVE IT. COOL. WELL, WE CAN HELP YOU WRAP IT UP. SO, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU GUYS. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE CLASSIC-CAR HOBBY? JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE BACK HISTORY REAL QUICK. OUR FIRST CAR WAS A 1939 CHEVY. BOTH KIDS WOULD CURL UP IN THE BACK SEAT AND WE'D TAKE LONG TRIPS IN IT. SO IS THAT YOUR THING? YOU LIKE DOING LONG TRIPS IN THESE CARS? WE DRIVE THEM EVERYWHERE. AND WE LOVE OUR CARS TO BE LOOKED AT AND COMMENTED ON. THAT'S WHY I CAN'T LEAVE A CAR ALONE. I'VE GOT TO CHANGE IT. WITH ANY BUILD, WE REALLY WANT TO CREATE AN EXPERIENCE FOR THE CUSTOMERS, SO IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT, NOT JUST TO FIND OUT WHAT THINGS PEOPLE WANT DONE TO THEIR CAR, BUT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DO WITH IT. I LIKE SPEED.I CAN TELL. WHAT IS THIS ENGINE? WELL, THE ENGINE, IT'S 11:1 COMPRESSION. IT'S BORED OUT TO A 408. IT'S ALL FORAGED COMPONENTS. THEY'RE ESTIMATING IT TO BE 650 HORSE. IT'S GOT A CUSTOM-COMP GROUND CAM FOR LOW-END TORQUE. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MELT THE TIRES IF WE WANT TO MELT 'EM. I THINK TIM AND CHRIS ARE GONNA BE AWESOME CLIENTS. THEY WANT THE CUSTOM. THEY WANT THE SPEED. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED ON THIS BUILD. SO, WHAT OTHER METAL DO WE HAVE FOR THIS THAT'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW? WE HAVE NEW RUNNING BOARDS. WE HAVE NEW REAR FENDERS. ALL THAT'S GONNA NEED SOME CHANGES MADE TO IT. THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRUCK, I WANT IT TO LOOK TRADITIONAL, BUT I WANT IT TO LOOK SLEEK, NEW, AND I WANT IT TIMELESS. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO -- YEAH, BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO SOUND LIKE? I WANT IT TO BE LOUD. AND WHAT DOES IT GOT TO FEEL LIKE? IT'S GOT TO BE FAST. SEE? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN'. YEAH. SO, WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THIS, WHERE'S YOUR FIRST TRIP GONNA BE? WE'RE GONNA DRIVE ROUTE 66, ALL THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA AND ALL THE WAY BACK. A DESERVING TRIP FOR WHAT IS A SWEET-LOOKING TRUCK SO FAR. I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT. I ALREADY LOVE THIS BUILD. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - THANKS. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET GOING ON THIS TRUCK, AND SINCE IT'S ALREADY HAD SOME WORK DONE, THERE IS NO TEAR DOWN. SO I TOLD CHARLES, "TAKE IT OVER TO SCOTT AND MARK AND GET THIS THING ROLLIN'." PUSH, MARK. I AM PUSHING, MAN. I GOT TO PUSH ALL BY MYSELF. WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU? HEY, YOU WANT TO COME OVER AND STEER? I'LL PUSH. MAN, YOU GUYS NEED HELP PUSHING? WE DO. WE'RE WEAK. SAY WHAT? YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? DUDE, I SEEN THAT FIREWALL WHEN YOU WERE COMING IN. THAT'S WICKED. THIS '53 CHEVY TRUCK HAS ALREADY HAD SOME WORK DONE TO IT. THE PRIOR BUILDER KIND OF SET THE TONE FOR WHAT THE CUSTOMERS ARE WANTING. BUT ONCE IT HITS OUR SHOP, WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT OUR OWN. AND AT THE END, THIS TRUCK IS GONNA BE A ROLLING WORK OF ART. DO THEY GOT THE REST OF THEIR TRUCK? OR IS THAT...? FENDERS. THEY'VE GOT BUMPERS. THEY'VE GOT ALL THE PIECES. STOCK STUFF.YEAH. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS TRUCK, YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA CUT IT. THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF METALWORK TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE REST OF THIS TRUCK. GUY PULLS A CLASSIC CAR IN. I'M ALWAYS THINKING OUT THE BOX. I WANT TO REACH AND SET THE BAR HIGHER. THE TAILGATE'S JUST, LIKE, SCREAMING, "DO SOMETHING TO ME," YEAH.WE'RE GONNA HAVE -- WE CAN'T LET IT GO OUT OF HERE LIKE THAT. WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND IT'S GONNA BE FUN. Charles: SO, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK. WE HAVE TO MOCK UP THE FRONT END AND THEN BUILD THE INNER FENDER WALLS. YEAH. AND THEN... THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD-LOOKIN' TRUCKS FROM THE FACTORY. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS WITH HOW TO MAKE THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK KIND OF GO WITH THE REST OF IT? BRING IT IN AND TAKE SOME OF THE, LIKE, STEP BUMPER AWAY FROM THE FRONT. HE DOES WANT FOG LIGHTS ON THIS TRUCK. I DON'T KNOW -- - IT'S A MUST? - IT'S A MUST. HE WANTS US TO GET CREATIVE AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THEM LOOK OKAY ON THE FRONT OF THIS TRUCK. THIS IS GONNA BE A HARD ONE TO PULL OFF. IT NEEDS TO BE OVER-THE-TOP NICE BUT ALSO, IT HAS TO FUNCTION. THEY'RE GONNA TREAT THIS LIKE A NEW TRUCK AND THEY'RE GONNA GO OUT AND DRIVE IT. YEAH, WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT BUMPERS AND FOG LIGHTS.

TONY IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE CUSTOMER. TOTAL WACK JOB. HE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE, SUPER LOUD. BUT WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? LAST YEAR, TONY BRINGS IN THIS '62 BEL AIR FOR A BUNCH OF CUSTOM UPGRADES BEFORE HE GOES SURFING DOWN IN FLORIDA. SO, TONY'S BACK. NO TAN. NO SURFBOARD.

WHO KNOWS? WE MIGHT JUST MEET IN THE MIDDLE. BUMPERS NEVER LOOK GOOD ON ANYBODY'S TRUCK. THEY'RE JUST KIND OF WAY OUT AND HANGING DOWN AND... I ACTUALLY TRY TO SHAPE IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND MAKE IT A PART OF THE BODY VERSUS THE BUMPER HANGING WAY OUT. EVERY PART OF THIS TRUCK HAS BEEN TOUCHED.

I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU. ♪♪ HEY, RYAN. COME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT? WHOA! THERE'S ABOUT A HALF INCH OF MUD IN HERE. AND THEY ALSO MUDDED THE INSIDE. IT'S A LITTLE SOFTY. SOMEONE SHOULD BE A DRYWALLER. SO, TRAVIS AND JUST FOUND, IN THE BACK OF THIS '53 CHEVY TRUCK CAB, ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS, JUST REALLY CRAPPY BODY WORK. IT WAS UNDERNEATH A TON OF MUD. AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS MUDDED ON THE INSIDE TO MASK IT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT'S UNDERNEATH ALL OF THAT. SO IT COULD POTENTIALLY GET EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT IT IS NOW. YEAH, LET ME GO GET MARK. Mark: WHAT'S UP? HEY, YOU WANT TO LOOK AT SOMETHING? MARK CAN BE EXTREMELY HARD TO READ. LIKE A MONOTONE VOICE, BUT THAT'S HIS FACE. LIKE, YOU JUST SIT THERE AND LOOK AT HIM AND IT'S JUST BLANK STARE, AND YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE'S PISSED AT YOU OR IF HE'S... I DON'T KNOW. YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE'S THINKING. SO, THE BACK OF THIS CAB. LOOK WHAT TRAVIS FOUND. HOLY CRAP. THIS THING'S BEEN CAVED IN, SO THIS IS, LIKE, A HUGE SETBACK FOR US. WE FIGURED THE BACK OF THE CAB MIGHT HAVE HAD A LITTLE MUD IN IT AND WE WERE JUST GONNA KNOCK IT DOWN AND REWORK IT REAL QUICK AND KEEP ON MOVING, BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SO, NEXT TIME YOU SAY "YOU WANT TO COME LOOK AT THIS," I SHOULD SAY NO? DON'T COME LOOK AT IT, YEAH. RYAN NEVER COMES OVER JUST TO SAY "HI" OR "HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING" OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, OR JUST GIVE ME A HUG. WOW. WELL, THAT'S A MAJOR SETBACK. RYAN AND TRAVIS FOUND OUT THE BACK OF THE CAB IS TRASHED. I MEAN, IT'S CAVED IN, HAMMERED IN, FULL OF MUD. REALLY NOT A GOOD TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT. THIS REALLY SUCKS. ALL THREE OF YOU STANDING HERE MAKES ME PRETTY DAMN NERVOUS. WHAT THE HELL IS THE PROBLEM? TURN YOUR HAND ACROSS THERE AND YOU'LL FIND OUT. THEY HIT IT ALL ON THE INSIDE WITH BODY FILLER ALSO. Ryan: THEY USED A SHRINKING HAMMER SO HARD OVER THERE, THERE'S LIKE LITTLE HOLES FROM THE SHRINKING HAMMER ALL AROUND THAT AREA. YEAH, BUT THIS IS LIKE SO WEAK BACK HERE. I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO STRAIGHTEN IT A LITTLE BIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I THINK IT'D BE BETTER TO CUT IT OUT, BUT... YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO CUT THIS WHOLE PANEL OUT AND REPLACE IT. I'D RATHER TRY TO STRAIGHTEN. I THINK THAT'S A WASTE OF TIME. WHY? I JUST THINK IT'D BE QUICKER TO SECTION IT. COME ON, MAN. - IT'S ALL ABOUT TIME. - I KNOW. BUT DO YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH TIME IT'S GONNA TAKE TO CUT THIS WHOLE PANEL OUT AND REPLACE IT? IT WON'T TAKE ANY TIME TO CUT IT OUT. NO. FIVE MINUTES. REPLACING IT THOUGH AND DOING IT RIGHT? I THINK WE GOT TO TRY IT. CHARLES'S PLAN IS TO HAVE US COME THROUGH AND HEAT-SHRINK AND METAL AND DOLLY AND... IT'S KIND OF, AT THIS POINT, A 50/50. THE ISSUE IS, IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THEN ALL THAT TIME IS NOW WASTED. OH, WE CAN DO THIS... GIVE IT A SHOT. WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO GET IT DONE. IT'S JUST GONNA BE SOME LATE NIGHTS AND... KNOCK IT OUT. ♪♪ THE WAY I WANT THESE GUYS TO FIX THE CAB IS WITH HAMMER-AND-DOLLY TECHNIQUE. SO THEY'RE GONNA GET A HAMMER ON ONE SIDE, DOLLY ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND ACTUALLY MASSAGE THAT METAL TO GET IT BACK STRAIGHT AGAIN. ANY TIME YOU CAN SAVE ORIGINAL METAL ON A PROJECT, YOU'RE BETTER OFF. INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FULLY REPLACE IT, WE'RE GETTING STRAIGHTENED OUT. HAD TO DO SOME ADJUSTING ON THE INSIDE -- BRACES INSTEAD OF CUTTING THEM OUT AND REPLACING THEM OR MOVING THEM. IT'S ACTUALLY GONE A LITTLE FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA GO IN THE FIRST PLACE. LOOK AT THE DUST AROUND HERE. JESUS. THAT'S GOOD. YOU GUYS DID NICE WORK.THANK YOU. SEE? I HAD FAITH IN YOU ALL ALONG. RYAN? THAT'S ALL YOU GOT, IS A THUMBS UP? AND YOU'RE STILL SMILING. I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU TODAY. NO. LEAN OVER. NO. COME ON, RYAN. HERE, I'LL MEET YOU IN THE MIDDLE. [ "YANKEE DOODLE DANDY" PLAYS ] IT'S BACKWARDS. OH, IT IS? YEAH, THERE'S A TAG THERE. THERE YOU GO. PERFECT. GOOD JOB. YOU'RE GOOD-LOOKIN', LINCOLN. KEEP IT HONEST. SO, LAST YEAR, CHARLES GAVE ME THIS ABE LINCOLN HAT... I'M SO HAPPY, LIKE, TO SEE ALL THIS WORK DONE THAT I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. OKAY. ...BECAUSE I'M BLATANTLY HONEST SOMETIMES. IF I DON'T LIKE SOME THINGS, THEN I'LL LET HIM KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'LL WEAR THE HAT TODAY TO KEEP HIM HAPPY. 'CAUSE OTHERWISE, HE'LL JUST KEEP HOUNDING ME ABOUT IT AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING DONE. MY HONEST OPINION, YOU LOOK PRETTY GOOD WITH THE HAT ON, MAN. ♪♪ Randy: TODAY WE'RE GONNA PUT A POWER-STEERING SETUP ON THE '62 BEL AIR. IT WAS A MANUAL-STEERING SETUP BEFORE. THE TOUGHEST PART ABOUT THIS POWER-STEERING CONVERSION IS FITTING ALL THE NEW STUFF WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING BEFORE. YOU START WITH A MANUAL-STEERING BOX, WHICH IS PRETTY SMALL. NOW WE'VE GOT A PUMP AND A BELT, HOSES AND A POWER-STEERING GEARBOX WHICH IS ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF THE FACTORY BOX. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY AFTER-MARKET PARTS FIT ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME AND THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. ♪♪ I'D LIKE TO FIND WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER WITH HOME DEPOT HARDWARE. WE GOT THE SHAFT ON THIS ONE. ONCE WE'RE DONE WITH THE STEERING SHAFT, I'M GONNA PUT THE POWER-STEERING GEARBOX IN, AND THEN WE'LL GET IT HOOKED UP WITH A PITMAN ARM, TIGHTEN EVERYTHING UP, AND MOVE ON FROM THERE. ♪♪ WE JUST GOT THE STEERING BOX PUT IN THE '62 BEL AIR. WE'RE HAVING A SMALL CLEARANCE ISSUE BETWEEN THE FRONT SWAY BAR AND THE GEARBOX AND THE FRONT SWAY BAR AND THE PITMAN ARM. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS TAKE IT ALL BACK OUT AND SHAVE A LITTLE OFF THE PITMAN ARM, SHAVE A LITTLE BIT OFF OF THE BOX JUST TO GET A TINY BIT OF CLEARANCE. ♪♪ IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT WE HAD TO SHAVE A LITTLE BIT OFF THE PITMAN ARM, A LITTLE BIT OFF THE GEARBOX. NOW WE'VE GOT IT CLEARING. IT DOESN'T HIT THE SWAY BAR. EVERYTHING JIVES. AND THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY BINDING OR, UH, CRASHING. ♪♪ WE JUST WRAPPED UP WITH DOING THE BODY WORK ON THE BED, AND THE BED COVER JUST ARRIVED, SO WE'RE GONNA FIT IT IN THAT HOLE, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING LINES UP. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SET IT UP ON THERE. WE GOT TO ROTATE. THAT'S A QUESTION FOR GOD. OW! GOD. BASICALLY WE'VE GOT TO SET THE TONNEAU COVER ON THE TRUCK, ON THE BED. THEN WE NEED SOMEONE TO GET INSIDE OF IT AND MAKE SOME MARKS WHERE WE CAN PUT THE HINGES IN THE FRONT. THIS IS THE PART I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. WE GOT TO GET TWO BOLTS THROUGH THERE AND BE IN THAT POCKET. NOW IF WE STICK RYAN IN THERE, CLOSE THE GATE, HE CAN MARK AROUND THOSE HINGES. Ryan: I WOULDN'T MIND CRAWLING INTO THIS THING, BUT IT WOULDN'T BEEN NICE TO HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO IT, NOT JUST STRAIGHT VOLUNTEERED. GAP THE FRONT HOW YOU WANT IT. - POINT AT SOME GAPS AND... - POINT AT YOUR **** [ AIR HISSES ] - OH **** - [ LAUGHS ] HEY, ARE YOU HUNGRY? BANANA IN HERE. GET OUT OF HERE! Mark: HOLD IT UP, DUDE. IT'S CROOKED. COME ON. HOLD IT UP. QUIT PLAYING AROUND. YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU PUT YOUR BEARD INTO IT. I'M JUST TRYING TO GAP OUT THE BED HERE. DAMN IT! YOU POKED ME IN THE EYE. - ABOUT TIME YOU GET OUT OF BED. - DID YOU EAT ALL YOUR BANANAS? GET OUT OF HERE! WE GOT THE TONNEAU COVER ALL MEASURED UP. WE JUST NEED TO BOLT IT IN, FINISH THE BODY WORK, AND IT'S OFF TO PRIMER. WE'RE READY TO GO. ♪♪ Travis: IN ORDER FOR THE BED COVER TO LAY FLUSH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOWER THE TAILGATE JUST A LITTLE BIT, TO MAKE EVERYTHING LOOK GOOD AND LINE UP WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE. I AM GONNA TAKE THE CUT-OFF WHEEL AND CUT THROUGH HERE, STRAIGHT ALONG THIS EDGE. WE'RE GONNA HAMMER IT DOWN, MAKE IT NICE AND FLAT, AND WELD IT BACK UP AND HAVE TO RE-BODY-WORK IT. I GOT MY GAP WHERE I NEED IT BE, BUT NOW IT FITS BUT IT DOESN'T FIT. DAMN IT. NOW THE TOP OF THE TAILGATE, WHERE IT MEETS THE SIDE RAILS, IS TOO LOW. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE EVEN GONNA START TO MAKE IT RIGHT. LET ME GUESS. SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED? IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY "HAPPEN." DID YOU MAKE A MISTAKE? NO. IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK GOOD NOW SINCE WE DID OUR MODIFICATIONS ON THE BOTTOM TO MAKE UP FOR THE TONNEAU COVER ON TOP. BUT NOW OUR DILEMMA IS, OUR TAILGATE DOES NOT FIT THE REST OF THE BED. RIGHT. I SEE THE STEP. WHEN THE SINGLE COMES DOWN, THE TAILGATE'S LOWER. LOWER, AND THAT'S NOT GONNA LOOK GOOD. NO. WE GOT TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE IT LOOK RIGHT. Dan: WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? THIS TAILGATE SITS ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH DOWN. I SEE THAT. WE LOWERED OUR TAILGATE TO MAKE UP FOR THE TONNEAU COVER TO BE FLUSH WHERE WE WANTED IT TO BE. - RIGHT. - BUT NOW... WE'VE GONE TOO FAR.IT DOESN'T LINE UP. YEAH, BECAUSE THAT BED COVER'S GONNA RIDE RIGHT ALONG THIS BRAKE. GOD, THAT SUCKS. I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. IT SUCKS. SO, WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A 100% CUSTOM TRUCK, YOU'RE BOUND TO HAVE A LOT OF FITMENT ISSUES, AND THIS TRUCK HAS A TON OF THEM. IT'S JUST GOT TO LOOK BETTER. IT'S GOT TO LOOK RIGHT. WE'RE NOT GONNA STOP SHORT OF THAT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE SHORT OF IT RIGHT NOW. WE ARE SHORT OF IT. **** COMEDIAN.[ CHUCKLES ] SO, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. WE'RE GONNA RAISE UP THE TAILGATE. WE'RE GONNA ADD METAL TO THE BOTTOM. AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT TO WHERE THE TONNEAU COVER SITS DOWN FLUSH WITH THE BACK OF THE TAILGATE. WAIT. WHO'S DOING THIS? YOU. ME? YOU'RE DOING IT. TRAVIS IS JUST HERE FOR BACKUP. YOU OKAY WITH THAT, HATER DAN? PEOPLE CALL ME HATER DAN BECAUSE I TALK A LOT OF **** AND I DON'T SEEM ALL THAT EXCITED. BUT THEY SURE DON'T HATE IT WHEN I COME IN, AND I FIX ALL THEIR PROBLEMS... LIKE A DAMN... CUSTOM-CAR PROBLEM-SOLVIN' FAIRY. I THINK IT'S GONNA WORK OUT WELL. IT'LL LOOK THE BEST THAT WAY, TOO. POSITIVE. I LIKE IT. POSITIVE DAN. NO HATIN' TODAY. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW. ♪♪ AFTER I GET THE TOP OF THE BED AND THE TOP OF THE TAILGATE BODY WORK TO EACH OTHER, I'LL KNOW IF THE TAILGATE IS ACTUALLY IN THE RIGHT POSITION. AND THEN I CAN ADD ON TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TAILGATE TO FIX OUR GAP DOWN THERE. NOW I HAVE TO LENGTHEN THE BOTTOM OF THE TAILGATE. I'M JUST GONNA LENGTHEN IT WITH A PIECE OF "L" CHANNEL.

I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT A SINGLE ORIGINAL ELEMENT. THE DASH IS DIFFERENT. THE CAB IS A DIFFERENT SIZE. WE NEED TO DO THAT MORE OFTEN, EXTRA 5 INCHES. EVERYBODY COULD USE AN EXTRA 5 INCHES.
