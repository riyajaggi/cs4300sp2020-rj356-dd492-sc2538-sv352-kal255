 THERE'S NO MOTOR. DOES HE HAVE A TITLE? Narrator: AND, AFTER 13 YEARS, A COBRA IS DYING TO HIT THE ROAD. OH, MY GOD. THIS THING'S KIND OF A DEATH TRAP. IT'S A RACE TO THE FINISH... DON'T YOU LOVE THESE LATE-NIGHT MAD THRASHES? ...TO TURN THESE SHELLS INTO HIGH-PERFORMANCE MACHINES. LET'S LIGHT THIS THING OFF. [ ENGINE STARTS ] HOLY ****! GOD! MAKING A CAR LOOK GOOD, FOR US, THAT'S A GIVEN. MAKING A CAR PERFORM, THAT'S OUR SPECIALTY.

 HERE AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO, MY TEAM OF VISIONARIES AND MASTER CRAFTSMEN TAKE CARS OF ALL KINDS AND TRANSFORM THEM INTO CUSTOM-TAILORED, HIGH-PERFORMANCE RIDES. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS AND HAUL ASS, WE'RE THE SHOP FOR YOU BECAUSE, HERE, SPEED IS THE NEW BLACK. ST. LOUIS IS A CAR TOWN, AND I'M A CAR GUY. FOR ME, IT ALL STARTED WITH AMERICAN MUSCLE. I MEAN, IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY THESE CARS HAVE A DIE-HARD CULT FOLLOWING, BUT WITH POPULARITY COMES SIMILARITY, AND THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR OUR SHOP OR FOR OUR CLIENTS. THINK WE'RE GOING TO TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL. IT'S A PROCHARGER, FOR SURE. Noah: THEY WANT HIGH-END, ONE-OFF, PERFORMANCE MACHINES, EACH ONE CUSTOM-TAILORED TO THEM. DOING A CUSTOM MANDREL-BENT EXHAUST HERE FOR THIS ONE-OF-A-KIND CORVETTE. FOR US, NO CAR, NO BUILD, AND NO CLIENT IS EVER THE SAME, AND TODAY IS NO DIFFERENT. WHAT'S GOING ON, BROTHER? GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. THANKS FOR COMING IN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. GOT A GREAT CUSTOMER COMING IN TODAY. HIS NAME IS JAMES, BUYS A FEW CARS A MONTH, GETS REALLY INTO THEM, DOES A TON OF WORK, AND THEN, LIKE THAT, THEY'RE GONE, SO I'M KIND OF INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT KIND OF MUSTANG HE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BRING IN TODAY. ** SO I KNOW PART OF THE STORY. YOU DRANK 10 TO 15 LIGHT BEERS ALONE AND THEN GOT ON EBAY AND MADE THIS LOVELY PURCHASE? NO, ACTUALLY 30, PROBABLY. - THIRTY? - MY WIFE LOVES ME. [ LAUGHS ] 1965 FORD MUSTANGS WERE THE MOST ICONIC MUSCLE CARS OF ALL TIME. TONS OF PARTS AVAILABLE, IF YOU WANT TO GO ALL STOCK, YOU CAN GO ALL STOCK. YOU CAN GO TOTALLY CUSTOM CRAZY IF YOU WANT AS WELL. MY BEST PURCHASES ARE WHEN I'M HAMMERED, BUT, YEAH, GOT THIS ON EBAY, MAN. - AWESOME. - WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S A GOOD BLANK SLATE. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S, YOU KNOW, MISSING A LOT OF PARTS, BUT THAT'S ALL THE STUFF YOU'D WANT TO PUT IN THERE ANYWAY. SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO WITH THE CAR? YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE YOU WANT TO HAVE? - I WANT IT TO HAUL ASS. - YEP. AND I WANT IT TO HANDLE GOOD. I GREW UP WITH RACING IN MY BLOOD, IF YOU WILL. MY DAD, HE USED TO BRACKET-RACE BACK IN THE DAY, AND I KIND OF DID SOME OF THAT WITH HIM AND HELPED HIM BUILD CARS. WE HAD A COUPLE MUSTANGS, AND I'D ALWAYS WANTED A '65, BUT WHEN I BOUGHT IT, I KNEW THERE WERE SEVERAL CHANGES THAT I WANTED TO DO AND HAVE NOAH AND THE GUYS TAKE CARE OF THAT. ARE YOU THINKING MORE, LIKE, IN TERMS OF STYLE, LIKE, VINTAGE RACE CAR, BADASS STREET MACHINE? STREET, YEAH, DEFINITELY WANT IT TO HAUL ASS ON THE TRACK AND THE STREET. I WANT TO KEEP THE BODY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. RIGHT. I WANT IT OLD-SCHOOL, BUT I WANT NEW TECHNOLOGY. ALL RIGHT. I WANT THIS CAR TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING BECAUSE THIS HOT MESS DOES NOT WANT TO SWEAT. - NO, WE DON'T WANT THAT EITHER. - ALL RIGHT. THIS PARTICULAR CAR IS NOT GOING TO BE STOCK. IT'S GOING TO BE MORE OF A RESTO MOD WHERE IT HAS A LOT OF THE NOSTALGIC LOOK OF THE '65 MUSTANG BUT A LOT OF THE NEWER FEATURES WHERE IT'S NOT BREAKING DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PAINT. IT'S WHITE. - YES. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EXCITING TO YOU, BUT IT'S NOT EXCITING TO ME. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE, LOOKING AT IT, IS GOING TO BE LIKE, "OH, IT'S THE COOLEST WHITE MUSTANG." SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH WHITE? YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK WHITE IS BAD. ON THIS CAR THOUGH, I JUST DON'T THINK IT DOES IT JUSTICE. MAYBE YOU'LL LET ME CHOOSE A CUSTOM COLOR FOR YOU. PICTURE IT. YOU HAVE ALL-NEW PAINT, BADASS NEW WHEELS, AND A KICK-ASS-LOOKING, RACY INTERIOR. IT'S GOING TO COMPLETELY CHANGE THE LOOK OF THE CAR. ALL RIGHT. I'LL LET YOU WORK YOUR MAGIC. I'M GOOD WITH THAT. - HEY, I'M EXCITED. WHAT ABOUT THE WHEELS? - I WANT ROUND WHEELS. - YOU WANT ROUND WHEELS? - THEY HAVE TO BE ROUND. WE TRIED THE SQUARE WHEELS, HORRIBLE. WELL, THE FRICTION THING... BUMP, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP. MY PERSONAL GOAL, IN TERMS OF BUILDING THIS CAR FOR JAMES, IS TO MAKE HIM KEEP IT FOR LONGER THAN 2 MONTHS. HE GETS BORED SO QUICKLY. GIVE IT A TOTALLY KILLER, CUSTOM LOOK, CLEAN AND FAST. - CLEAN AND FAST. - CLEAN AND FAST. WE'LL MAKE THAT HAPPEN. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. WHEN THEY GET COMPLETE WITH THE CAR, I WANT TO TURN THE KEY. I WANT TO FEEL AND HEAR THAT POWER. I WANT TO HAVE COMFORT, AND I WANT THAT CAR TO POP AND JUST LOOK GREAT. ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M REALLY EXCITED. ONE THING -- I JUST WANT TO HURRY UP AND GET THIS THING ON THE ROAD. - MAKE IT HAPPEN. - MAKE IT HAPPEN. - THANKS, PARTNER. - ALL RIGHT. BUDDY, THANK YOU. YEAH. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE YOU SOON, BABY. ** EVERYTHING WE DO AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO IS A TEAM EFFORT, SO BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING, I ALWAYS MEET WITH THE GUYS TO PLAN IT ALL OUT. THIS IS JAMES' MUSTANG. THIS IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE HE USUALLY BUYS COMPLETE CARS, AND THIS THING IS KIND OF HALF THERE. TODAY, I BROUGHT CHARLES, THE SHOP MANAGER, AND SCOTT, OUR LEAD FABRICATOR. CHARLES KEEPS THE SHOP ORGANIZED AND RUNNING SMOOTH. I TRUST HIM WITH ANYTHING. SCOTT'S A TALENTED MECHANIC AND AMAZING FABRICATOR AND ONE FUNNY DUDE. WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD? WHAT'S FOR POWER? YEAH, WHAT'S IN THERE? WELL, I THOUGHT THERE WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE SOMETHING UNDER THE HOOD, BUT WHEN I LIFTED IT UP, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF NOTHING. THE ENGINE BAY IS BARREN, HOWEVER, THERE'S A LOT OF RANDOM WIRES AND HOSES THAT ARE STILL HOOKED UP. I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FOR, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT USED TO BE IN THERE. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT STUFF IS AND GET HIM A NEW POWER PLANT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A GREAT BUY FOR JAMES, BUT FOR US AS A SHOP, I THINK WE CAN REALLY TURN IT INTO SOMETHING BADASS. HIS EXACT WORDS WERE, "LET'S BUILD A BADASS STREET MACHINE." ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE CLEARANCE FOR THE ENGINE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO? I THINK AN UNDER-HOOD SUPERCHARGER. MAYBE A PROCHARGER WOULD BE GOOD. WE'LL GET A TON OF POWER OUT OF IT. LOOKS LIKE WE GOT 50 SHADES OF WHITE. HE'S GIVEN US A LITTLE BIT OF LEEWAY, COME UP WITH SOMETHING CREATIVE. I SAID WE CAN MIX HIM UP SOMETHING. LIME-GREEN PEARL. LIME GREEN, WE COULD GO LIME GREEN. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO GO THAT FAR. THE INTERIOR IS... AGAIN, WE'RE MISSING SEATS. WE'VE GOT HALF A ROLL CAGE. SOMEONE INSTALLED A BIG STEREO SYSTEM IN THE BACK. THERE'S NO SEATS. THERE'S NO GAUGES. THERE'S NO MOTOR. DOES HE HAVE A TITLE? THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. SO HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, "BADASS STREET MACHINE," BUT WE KNOW JAMES. HE'S GOING TO NEED HIS CREATURE COMFORTS AS WELL. I THINK AIR CONDITIONING IS A MUST, AND I THINK WE CAN DO A SPORTY SEAT. THE HOOD IS VANILLA AS EVER, SO WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE HOOD. CAN START BY MAKING IT LINE UP FIRST. YOU GUYS THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT THE WAY THE PANELS LINE UP? NO, THEY JUST THREW IT TOGETHER TO SELL IT ON EBAY. - YEAH. - I DON'T KNOW. I THINK WE GOT PANEL-FITMENT ISSUES. THIS THING IS, LIKE... THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. MAYBE THEY... - THIS THING IS BARELY... - ...PULLED THE MOTOR OUT. YEAH. IT'S KIND OF MAKING ME NERVOUS. IT'S BARELY TOGETHER. IT LOOKS LIKE JAMES' EBAY BUY IS GOING TO BE A BIT OF A BASKET CASE FOR US. WELL, IT'S ALREADY GOT THE ROLL CAGE. PANELS ARE ALL TWISTED UP ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE IT'S PROBABLY BEEN A RACE CAR. WE MIGHT AS WELL FINESSE IT IN, DIAL IT IN. - YOU GUYS ONBOARD TO DO THIS? - YEAH. - LIME GREEN? - LIME GREEN. - BLAH. - ALL RIGHT. YOU IN? - COOL. - WE'RE IN. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. ** THE FIRST THING WE DO AFTER A DESIGN MEETING IS TEAR DOWN THE CAR TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. [ KNOCKING ] ALL FIBERGLASS. IF IT AIN'T STEEL, IT AIN'T REAL. Noah: SO CARS MAY LOOK GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT IT'S REALLY WHAT IS UNDERNEATH THAT COUNTS. MY FIRST IMPRESSION IS, IT AIN'T THAT BAD. TWO SCREWS HOLDING THE WHOLE FRONT END ON AND NO HEADLIGHTS PLUGGED IN. BUT I'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE. IS THAT TURNING OUT THERE, OR AM I GETTING A NUT OFF? NO, YOU'RE GETTING... [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, YOU'RE GETTING A NUT OFF, ALL RIGHT. HEY. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. - LET'S ROLL OUT THE BODY. - ALL RIGHT. Scott: WE JUST GOT DONE TEARING DOWN THE CAR, AND NOW IT'S THESE GUYS' TURN IN THE BODY SHOP TO MAKE SURE ALL THE PANELS FIT NICE AND STRAIGHT. YOU DON'T NEED ME, DO YOU? - NO. - NO. YOU CAN... - GET ON? - ...GET ON OUT, MAN. GET OUT. ** DOOR LOOKS A LITTLE BOWED. THERE COULD BE A LOT OF THINGS WRONG WITH THIS. Mark: THAT'S WHY I KEEP SAYING THESE DOORS ARE TWISTED. IT DON'T WANT TO... IT'S SOMETHING PUSHING ON THE BOTTOM. YEAH. YEAH. WHEN YOU'VE HAD IT ON THE FIRST LATCH, IT ACTUALLY LOOKS PRETTY EVEN. ABOUT EVEN. [ SIGHS ] I GUESS WE CAN PULL THE MOLDING OFF. HUH. THAT LOOKS A LOT BETTER. - THAT LOOKS WAY BETTER. YEAH. WON'T RUN WEATHER STRIPS. YEAH, LET'S JUST BE A FAIR-WEATHER CAR. COOL. AND CUT THE ROOF OFF AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. THIS CAR IS AN ABSOLUTE MESS. THE MORE WE WORK ON IT, THE MORE STUFF WE KEEP FINDING WRONG WITH IT, AND IT JUST IS TURNING INTO A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. THE ISSUE I'M HAVING IS THIS GAP LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, SO WHEN WE KICK THE DOOR DOWN, THAT'S GOING TO OPEN THIS GAP UP AT THE TOP. SO THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT ON THE FENDER. HOLY COW. AND THIS IS ALL BENT UP HERE, TOO. DOES IT LOOK LIKE THIS CORE SUPPORT IS LEANING? YEAH, IT DOES LOOK TILTED UP, WHICH NOW THE QUESTION IS, WHICH ONE SIDE NEED TO GO UP, OR THE OTHER SIDE NEEDS TO GO DOWN? WITH THIS FRONT END BEING OUT OF WHACK AND EVERYTHING, THIS IS CRAZY, MAN. I MEAN, THIS THING HAS GOT SOME MAJOR ISSUES. WHAT'S UP, GUYS? UP HERE, WE GOT MAJOR PROBLEMS GOING ON. - YEAH? LIKE? - YEAH. GET DOWN HERE AND LOOK AT THE CORE SUPPORT. CAN YOU SEE IT DOING THIS? - HOLY ****. LOOK AT THIS LINE HERE. - LOOK AT THIS GOOD THING. - YEAH. RARELY WHEN WE TEAR SOMETHING DOWN DO WE EVER HAVE GREAT NEWS. THIS CAR SEEMS TO HAVE PRESENTED A TON OF ISSUES THAT I WAS NOT EXPECTING. THEY SPLIT THE FENDER LIP AND RAISED THE WHOLE FENDER UP AND THEN... Mark: CUT THIS OFF. ...FOR SOME REASON, CUT THE TOP OF THE GRILLE OFF. UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT THE WHOLE CORE SUPPORT OUT, THE INNER FENDERS, NEW FENDER ON THAT SIDE. ARE YOU **** KIDDING ME, MAN? NO. - I DON'T KNOW. - IT'S THAT BAD. SO THIS IS A REALLY BAD PROBLEM TO HAVE. IF WE DON'T FIX IT QUICK, PROFIT MARGIN RIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN. DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE WE GO. ** Noah: WE'RE TRYING TO DO A CUSTOM MUSTANG FOR ONE OF OUR BEST CUSTOMERS, BUT THIS THING HAS SO MANY FITMENT ISSUES, I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET TO THE FUN STUFF. THIS CAR IS TOTALLY SCREWED. WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF ISSUES HERE THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT, AND WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THEY ARE YET. IT'S THAT RIGHT THERE. WHERE THIS IS HITTING THIS, IT'S DRAGGING. YOU CAN SEE THE MARK ON IT. YEAH. SEE IF YOU CAN DO THIS WITHOUT SCRAPING YOUR BACK. - RIGHT. - MAN, YOU'RE GOOD. I WAS A LIMBO CHAMPION IN 2014. - MAN, LOOK AT THIS. - YOU WANT TO GO? NO, NO, I GOT PROBLEMS GETTING UP OFF THE FLOOR. ** YEAH, NOTHING FITS AT ALL. ** Noah: WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS? Dan: WHAT'S UP? WE ORDERED A NEW FENDER FOR THIS MUSTANG, LOOKING FOR A QUICK FIX. I'M GOING TO GO CHECK IN WITH MARK AND DAN AND SEE IF WE GOT THINGS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. - HAVING FUN. - ANY PROGRESS? - I FIXED IT. - YEAH. LOOK AT ALL THESE SHIMS I PUT IN HERE. - NICE GAP. - YEAH, TO THROW A DOG THROUGH. - EH? - YEAH. THAT'S MY NOISE I MAKE WHEN I DID SOMETHING RIGHT. - EH? - YOU ONLY HAVE... - EH? - ...SEVEN SHIMS IN THERE. Charles: SO WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? IT NEEDS TO BE PULLED. I MEAN, THE WHOLE FRONT END IS OVER. RIGHT. THE WHOLE FRONT END NEEDS TO GO OVER THAT WAY, - AND IT MAY BE DOWN. - IT MAY BE DOWN. Noah: SO WERE YOU ABLE TO FIX THE DOORS? - EH. - ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M THINKING WE NEED TO SEND THIS THING OUT TO GET PULLED AND, YOU KNOW, GO FROM THERE. BUT GOOD JOB, DAN. - BEST SCENARIO. SHIM KING OF ST. LOUIS. WHATEVER. SO, IF THIS FRAME IS ACTUALLY OUT OF ALIGNMENT, OUR ONLY OPTION THERE IS TO SEND IT OUT TO ANOTHER SHOP. THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEND IT BACK SQUARE. ** TODAY, WE HAVE A CLIENT COMING IN WITH A 1965 COBRA KIT CAR TO GET A FRESH NEW LOOK. WELL, LAUREN, THANK FOR COMING IN. HERE SHE IS, A 1965 FACTORY FIVE MARK II, LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. THESE KIT CARS ARE COOL. IT'S A FACTORY FIVE, GREAT MODEL. IT'S GOT AN UPDATED MODERN CHASSIS, SAFER BRAKES, MUCH BETTER SUSPENSION THAN THEY EVER HAD, SO BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. SO YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS IN THE GARAGE? - IT WASN'T MY PROJECT. - OKAY. - IT WAS MY DAD - AND MY LITTLE BROTHER. GOT YOU. THEY STARTED IT, LIKE, 13, 15 YEARS AGO. - RIGHT. - AND THEN MY BROTHER MOVED AWAY, AND IT'S JUST BEEN SITTING THERE SINCE. DOES YOUR DAD KNOW THAT THE CAR IS HERE? NO, WE'RE GONNA SURPRISE HIM. IT'S STOOD STILL FOR SO LONG NOW THAT IT'S KIND OF AS FAR AS HE COULD GET IT ANYWAY. - OKAY. - AND I JUST NEED HELP. NEED HELP, THAT'S FINE. WE'RE HAPPY TO WRAP IT UP FOR YOU. SO THE BODY ITSELF LOOKS TO BE IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE. THAT BEING SAID, WHEN YOU GUYS ARE DONE WITH THE CAR, I ASSUME YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DRIVE IT AND HAVE IT BE USABLE. YEAH, WE DEFINITELY WANT IT TO BE USABLE. WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING TO RIDE IN IT FOR A LONG TIME. MY DAD PROMISED ME, ON MY WEDDING, I'D GET TO RIDE IN IT. RIGHT. SO I'M JUST NOT EVEN GOING TO DATE UNTIL IT'S DONE. WELL, WE CAN'T HOLD UP LIFE, AND THIS CAR CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T HOLD UP YOUR LIFE. SO, WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH PAINT, IF YOU'D ALLOW US JUST TO GO THROUGH IT, JUST NUT AND BOLT THE WHOLE THING, MAKE SURE ALL THE ELECTRICAL STUFF IS HOOKED UP CORRECTLY, IT'LL BE RUNNING, DRIVING, AND READY TO ENJOY. - YEAH. - IF THAT ALL SOUNDS GOOD, LET'S GO LOOK AT SOME PAINT COLORS. SOUNDS GOOD. CHOOSING PAINT COLOR CAN BE A LITTLE OVERWHELMING FOR CUSTOMERS. WITH LAUREN, WE STARTED WITH THREE. SO WE CAN LOOK AT 1,000 DIFFERENT REDS, BUT I'VE KIND OF NARROWED IT DOWN TO THREE FOR YOU JUST TO MAKE IT EASY. GOT THIS DARK ONE. IT'S A LITTLE MORE ORANGE IN IT. THEN WE'VE GOT THIS REAL BRIGHT RED HERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'D TOSS FIRST? WELL, I THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO GET RID OF THE SLUTTY RED. - THE SLUTTY RED? - THAT NEEDS TO GO. THE SLUTTY RED IS GONE. I KIND OF GOT TO AGREE WITH HER. IT'S KIND OF A ONE-NIGHT-STAND KIND OF RED. I DON'T THINK I'D DO A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP. THESE ARE NICE PEARLS, SO WHEN YOU WALK AROUND THE CAR, THE COLOR WILL FLIP A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, I THINK I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER, THE DEEPER RED. I THINK THIS WILL LOOK GREAT ON THE COBRA. I'M EXCITED TO SEE MY DAD'S FACE ONCE IT'S FINISHED WHEN HE GETS TO, YOU KNOW, START IT AND DRIVE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. I'M GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO JASON, AND HE'LL MIX UP A CUSTOM COLOR FOR US AND GO FROM THERE, GET SOME COLOR ON THE CAR. - AWESOME. THANKS. - THANK YOU. WHEN WE TORE DOWN THE CAR, WE FOUND OUT THAT THE FRONT END WAS OUT OF SQUARE, SO I CAME OVER TO WEST COUNTY AUTO BODY TODAY TO SEE MY FRIEND, ROB. LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY JUST KIND OF HACKED IT TOGETHER. ROB HAS SAVED ME MANY TIMES BEFORE, SO WHEN WE BRING HIM STUFF, IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING A LITTLE OUT OF THE NORM. WE NEED TO PULL IT OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE OR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR TO GET THE LOWER HALF OF THE FRAME RAIL STRAIGHT. [ METAL CREAKS ] SO WE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE? WE'RE REALLY CLOSE. [ METAL CREAKS ] THE TOP OF THIS APRON OR RAIL, IT'S JUST WAVY. IT LOOKS LIKE THE OCEAN UP HERE. WE NEED TO HAMMER AND DOLLY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THIS UPPER RAIL, AND I THINK THE FENDER WILL FIT LIKE IT SHOULD. OKAY. CHARLES, WE'RE PERFECTLY STRAIGHT. THANK GOD. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. SO I CHECK ON THIS FACTORY FIVE COBRA. WE ONLY HAVE 3 WEEKS TO GET READY SO THE FAMILY CAN SURPRISE DAD. I TOLD JASON TO GRAB ONE OF THE GUYS AND GET READY ASAP. IT'S LOOKING GOOD. I MEAN, I THINK ALL WE NEED TO DO IS SEAL IT AND SHOOT IT. IT SHOULD LOOK GOOD, SHOULD LOOK VERY, VERY GOOD. YEAH. I'D SAY WE JUST BLOW IT OFF, WIPE IT DOWN. LET'S GO WITH IT. I MEAN, IT'S NICE. IT'S READY TO GO. ** WE JUST GOT THE MUSTANG BACK FROM THE FRAME SHOP. WE'RE GETTING ALL SET UP. WE'RE GOING TO PUT A FOUR-LINK COILOVER KIT IN WITH A BRAND-NEW REAR END. WE'RE PUTTING AN 8-INCH MUSTANG REAR END IN THIS THING SO THAT WE'RE PLANTING HORSEPOWER ON THE GROUND PLENTY GOOD. ** YOU KNOW, THIS THING HAS GOT A LOT OF GO, SO NOW WE GOT A LOT OF WHOA. GO FAST, STOP FAST. YOU READY FOR THE TRANSPLANT? THAT'S GOOD. LET'S TRY THAT. ALL RIGHT. MAN, THAT'S IT. - I'LL GO GET THE SHOCKS. - ALL RIGHT. COILOVER SUSPENSION VERSUS A LEAF SPRING IS A LOT CLEANER, TIGHTER SET-UP. WITH TRADITIONAL SPRING, YOU'RE STUCK WITH WHAT YOU PUT IN THERE. COILOVER SUSPENSION IS FULLY ADJUSTABLE. YOU CAN RAISE IT UP OR LOWER IT ALL THE WAY DOWN AND GET A BETTER DRIVABILITY OUT OF THE CAR. WORRY ABOUT MY FINGERTIPS. - I'M NOT. - I CAN TELL. THAT'S IT, RIGHT? - YEP. - COOL. IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY BADASS LITTLE SETUP. GOT A SPECIAL DELIVERY FROM JAMES. - ARE THOSE FLOOR MATS? - IT'S FLAT. - MAYBE. - CAREFUL WITH THAT THING. - CUT YOU WITH IT. - YEAH. - OH, MAN. - UH-OH. Scott: THAT'S FIBERGLASS, MAN. I THOUGHT WE WERE BUILDING A SHEET-METAL HOOD. WELL, HE KIND OF BEAT US TO IT. OUR MUSTANG CLIENT, JAMES, IS A GREAT CUSTOMER, BUT HE'S NOTORIOUS FOR SENDING US PARTS THAT DON'T WORK, AND HE EXPECTS US TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THEM WORK. THIS MUST BE AN EBAY SPECIAL HOOD. Dustin: EBAY SPECIAL. Scott: THERE'S A LITTLE NOTE. WHAT'S IT SAY? HE WRITES LIKE A GIRL. HE DOES WRITE LIKE A GIRL. "LOOK AT THIS AWESOME HOOD I FOUND. IT'S GOING TO LOOK GREAT." THIS THING'S GONNA SUCK. LET'S AT LEAST TRY IT. YOU WANT TO TRY AND PUT IT ON NOW? YEAH, BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE A MONTH TO FIX IT, YOU KNOW. WE GETTING READY TO DO THIS **** HOOD STYLE. THIS FIBERGLASS STUFF IS NOT FOR ME. I DO NOT NEED FIBERGLASS ON ANY BUILDS THAT I DO. IF WE GOT TO HAVE A COOL BIG CRAZY HOOD SCOOP, WE'LL SHAPE IT OUT OF STEEL. BE CAREFUL. WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THAT BACK ON. OKAY. TRY THAT FOR A MINUTE. LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT. - AND... - OH. ...IT WON'T EVEN SHUT. DUDE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ** ALL RIGHT. LET'S START THERE. HOLY ****, MAN. THIS HOOD JUST DIPS DOWN. - IT'S GOT A MAJOR DIP IN IT? - IT'S, LIKE, SO BENT. - YEAH. - GREAT. LOOKS LIKE IT'S HITTING ON YOUR SIDE, TOO. - UH-OH. - ARE YOU GUYS ACTUALLY USING THAT HOOD? WELL, JAMES SENT IT UP HERE. I MEAN, WE THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT. I MEAN, THAT THING FITS LIKE ****. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BASICALLY REMAKE THIS HOOD. I WAS THINKING, MY KIDS NEED A NEW SLED FOR NEXT TIME IT SNOWS. THIS MIGHT BE PERFECT SLED. Noah: THEY DESERVE A BETTER SLED THAN THAT. FLIP IT OVER. LOOK AT THIS THING. IT'S A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. WE'VE PUSHED JAMES IN A LOT OF OTHER DIRECTIONS ON HIS CAR. LIKE, WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HOOD FIT, SO JUST MAKE THE HOOD FIT. NOT EVERY CLIENT'S CHOICE WOULD BE MY CHOICE, BUT THIS HOOD REALLY SPEAKS TO JAMES, SO WE OWE IT TO HIM TO MAKE IT WORK. Charles: ALL RIGHT. GUYS, YOU HEARD HIM. LET'S GET IT DONE. ALL RIGHT. - REALLY? - YEAH, WE GOT TO DO IT. - I AIN'T GOT A CLUE. - ME, NEITHER. LET'S FLUSH IT OUT THE OTHER SIDE. BODY SHOP. LAUREN PICKED A AWESOME COLOR, I MEAN, A RED THAT'S REALLY GOING TO POP. THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE VERY MANY COBRAS THAT ARE PAINTED LIKE THIS. ** DONE DEAL. [ AIR HOSE HISSES ] JAMES SENT US A 1967 FIBERGLASS HOOD TO GO ON A 1965 MUSTANG. THIS THING IS FIGHTING US ALL THE WAY. DAN'S BEEN WORKING ON IT ALL WEEK LONG TO GET IT DONE. I SWEAR PEOPLE THAT MAKE FIBERGLASS PARTS, LIKE, THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF VENDETTA AGAINST BODY MEN. SO I'M GOING TO EXTEND THE FRONT EDGE OF THE HOOD OUT TO MATCH HEADLIGHT BUCKETS. ** SO I JUST GOT TO FINISH UP SANDING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE HOOD, AND THEN IT'S READY TO GO TO PAINT. SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND. [ BUZZES ] * WHEN YOU GOT NO PLACE TO GO * DAN IS AN EXCELLENT BODY GUY, AN AMAZING PAINTER, AND HE'S BAT **** CRAZY. ** FINALLY, AFTER ABOUT 45 HOURS OF WORK, THIS HOOD FINALLY FITS THIS MUSTANG. I SHOULD TIGHTEN IT UNTIL IT STARTS - MAKING CRACKING NOISES, RIGHT? - NO. OH, YEAH. WELL, WE GOT A MUSTANG HOOD. FINALLY. **** YOU, TOM. SO THE PAINT ON THE COBRA TURNED OUT AMAZING, BUT THE INTERIOR IS KIND OF LACKING, SO I TALKED TO LAUREN, AND SHE AGREED TO LET US DO AN ENTIRELY NEW INTERIOR ON THIS CAR, BRING THE WHOLE THING FULL CIRCLE. WORKING ON COBRA DOOR PANELS, LITTLE BIT OF LEATHER, SOME PLEATS AND STYLE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. LET'S FINISH THEM UP AND GET THEM IN THE CAR. WHEN IT COMES TO ONE-OFF, BADASS, OVER-THE-TOP INTERIORS THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY BLOW YOU AWAY, WE'VE GOT A SECRET WEAPON, AND HIS NAME IS BRYAN. WE'VE BLOWN APART THE COBRA SEAT, GONNA USE IT AS A PATTERN TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE. ** HEY. WHAT'S UP, NOAH? I WANT TO TAKE THIS THING FOR A QUICK TEST DRIVE BEFORE WE TURN IT BACK OVER TO BOB. WITH NO DOORS AND NO TRUNK? I JUST GOT TO GET IT DONE NOW... - I KNOW IT'S A NICE DAY. - ...WHILE IT'S NICE OUTSIDE. YEAH. - ALL RIGHT. - I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - ALL RIGHT. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER, STARTS ] [ ENGINE REVS ] OH, MY GOD. ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS TOO SOON. THIS THING IS KIND OF A DEATH TRAP. I THINK I TOOK IT A LITTLE TOO EARLY. YEAH. SO WE GOT TO CHECK A COUPLE RATTLES. THE REAR BRAKES LOCKED UP ON ME. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE FRONT BRAKES ARE WORKING AT ALL OR JUST BARELY. - OH. AND THEN SOMETHING IS UP WITH THE RACK. - ALL RIGHT. - I THINK THERE'S A BIG... I WAS GOING AROUND A TURN. THERE'S A HUGE DEAD SPOT. - REALLY? - IT'S STRANGE. - ALL RIGHT. - IT'S LIKE A DRIFT CAR. ** HEY, IAN. WE JUST GOT A... WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON TODAY, MAN? ON THIS COBRA KIT CAR. NOAH TEST-DROVE THIS CAR. IT WAS ALL OVER THE ROAD. WE GOT TO GO FROM FRONT TO REAR, CHECK EVERY NUT AND BOLT. WE'RE ROCKING IT. - SOUNDS GOOD. - OKAY? RIGHT ON. THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT LOOSE. WOW. CALIBER BOLTS WEREN'T EVEN TIGHT. IAN, LOOK WHAT I FOUND. IS THERE SPACE IN BETWEEN THERE? YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. I DIDN'T SEE THAT WHEN WE WERE... OH, WOW. - YOU KNOW, THE... - YEAH. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE CORRECT SPACERS IN THE REAR CONTROL ARMS. NOAH SAID HE HEARD A NOISE, SO THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS DOING, FLOATING AROUND. THAT'S GARAGE-BUILT. - YEP. YOU WANT A MACHINE SPACER. - YEP. ALWAYS SOMETHING. YEAH, WE GOT BRAKE ISSUES. THE PROPORTION VALVE WAS RIGHT HERE BEHIND THE HEADER, WHICH THAT'S GOING TO BOIL THE BRAKE FLUID, SO I MOVED THAT DOWN HERE AND THEN WENT TO BLEED THE BRAKES AND FOUND OUT WE HAVE NO FRONT BRAKES, SO I'M DIGGING INTO IT, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE DID WRONG IN HIS ONE-CAR GARAGE. ONE OF THE THINGS I SUSPECT IS THE PUSHROD. I NOTICED IT'S BEEN MODIFIED. SOMEBODY'S WELDED ON THE ENDS, SO IT'S PROBABLY TOO LONG, SO I EITHER GOT TO FIND AN ADJUSTABLE ONE OR MAKE AN ADJUSTABLE ONE, AND THAT COULD TAKE TIME. Noah: TO GET THE FINISH WE WANT ON JAMES' CAR, FIRST, WE'RE LAYING DOWN BLACK AND THEN TWO COATS OF GREEN AND THEN ALL THE CLEAR ON TOP OF THAT. SO THE END RESULT IS GOING TO BE A REALLY DEEP, DARK, PISSED-OFF-LOOKING GREEN. I THINK JAMES IS GOING TO LOVE IT. ** ** Jason: AND I JUST GOT THE HOOD IN A BLACK-BROWN COAT, SO NOW WE'RE READY TO FINISH PUTTING THE GREEN BASE COAT ON, AND WE'LL BE READY TO CLEAR. ** GONNA MAKE SOME VENTS FOR THE FASTBACK, SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT OUT OF FIBERGLASS. Noah: JAMES WANTS A REALLY UNIQUE WAY TO FUEL THE MUSTANG, SO I TOLD BRYAN, "COME UP WITH A COOL WAY TO INCORPORATE THE FUEL FILL INTO THE SIDE VENTS." PENCIL GRINDER. [ WHIRS ] GETTING A FIRST LAYER OF FIBERGLASS ON WHAT WE JUST BUILT, GLUING THEM TOGETHER, MAKE IT ONE PIECE. ** AND, AFTER THIS, WE'LL CLEAN IT UP, FILL IT IN, AND ADD SOME LAYERS FOR STRENGTH. ** - PUT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. - YEAH. Paul: WE'RE PUTTING A 331-CUBIC-INCH SMALL-BLOCK FORD IN JAMES' MUSTANG. IT SHOULD MAKE ABOUT 650 TO 700 IN THE TIRE WITH THE SUPERCHARGER THAT'S ON IT. WELL, SO FAR, SO GOOD. LOWER HER DOWN. AWESOME. - SWEET. Paul: OKAY. WE GOT THE ENGINE ALL INSTALLED. EVERYTHING IS HOOKED UP, AND WE GOT THE FUEL SYSTEM UPGRADED. WE PUT A DOMINATOR SYSTEM IN IT. LET'S LIGHT THIS THING OFF. WHAT DO YOU THINK? [ ENGINE TURNS OVER, STARTS ] [ ENGINE REVS ] YOU GUYS ARE LIKE SCOTT AND TODD WITHOUT ALL THE BULL ****. - RIGHT. - LOOK AT... - UH-OH. UH-OH. - SMOKE. - SMOKING. - WE GOT SMOKE. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO DIAL THIS THING IN, PAUL? WE GOT TO SET IT ON FIRE LIKE IT'S DOING RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU GET THIS KIND OF SMOKE OFF AN ENGINE, IT'S OFTEN BECAUSE OF FINGERPRINTS OR MAYBE, LIKE, SOME SILICONE OR SOME OIL THAT HAD SPILT ON THE HEADERS. NOAH JUST LIKES TO MESS WITH ME. WE ALREADY CALIBRATED THE TPS. YOU WANT TO SEND SOME SMOKE SIGNALS? ARE YOU GUYS EVER SERIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING? WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DIAL IT IN UNTIL WE CAN REALLY DRIVE IT. WITH SPEED, THERE IS SMOKE. WORDS OF WISDOM. GOOD JOB, GUYS. - THANKS. - THANKS. THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK. - AWKWARD HIGH FIVE, GUY. - I'M THINKING YEAH. [ RINGING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - Ah. - HOLD ON. HOLD ON. YOU'RE ALL PIXELATED. What are you doing, buddy? JUST HIDING FROM YOU. I was getting a little paranoid, and I know we talked, you know, a couple weeks back about the paint color, and I know y'all have been doing a bunch of prep work on the Mustang, but, man, I really think I want to stay with white, honestly. So let's... - YOU WHAT?! White. Can you hear me? WELCOME TO "LOVE TUNE-UP." TODAY, I HAVE A LETTER FROM SUZIE FROM MONTANA. SHE WRITES IN, "DEAR 'LOVE TUNE-UP, ' IT FEELS LIKE RECENTLY MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN MORE INTERESTED IN REBUILDING HIS CARBURETOR ON HIS '32 FORD THAN HE IS IN REBUILDING OUR MARRIAGE. PLEASE HELP." [ PAPER CRINKLES ] LOOK, SUZIE, YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF WHAT YOU HAVE IS WORTH REBUILDING BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING, AND IF YOU FEEL THAT IT IS, TEAR IT DOWN. DIAGNOSE IT. CHECK IT ALL OUT. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM REALLY IS. COULD BE A WORN THROTTLE SHAFT. COULD BE A BAD FLOAT. MOST OF THE TIME, IT'S A BAD POWER VALVE. IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, COULD BE A SIMPLE FIX, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF WHAT YOU HAVE IS WORTH REBUILDING BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING. THANKS, SUZIE. HOPE THIS HELPS. ** I really think I want to stay with white, honestly. So let's... - YOU WHAT?! White. Can you hear me? WE ARE 2 MONTHS INTO A FULL-ON BUILD OF A 1965 FORD MUSTANG, TURNING IT FROM A TOTAL PIECE OF GARBAGE INTO A BADASS TRACK MACHINE, AWESOME, NEW COILOVER SUSPENSION, BIG BRAKES AND ALL THE ENGINE STUFF WE CAN DO, GAVE IT A BADASS PAINT SCHEME. THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE, I GET A CALL FROM THE CUSTOMER WHO WANTS TO CHANGE THE COLOR. THIS IS NO GOOD. YEAH, BUT WE ALREADY PAINTED YOUR CAR, JAMES. ****. You did not paint my car. IT'S DONE, MAN. IT'S WET-SANDED. The whole car, not just the front? EVERYTHING. WE EVEN FINISHED YOUR CRAZY HOOD. YEAH, IT LOOKS AWESOME, TOO. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. HANG IN THERE, SQUIRRELLY. MY GOAL IS TO BUILD YOU A CAR YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP FOR AT LEAST 2 MONTHS, [ LAUGHS ] AND IT'S GOT A PAINT JOB THAT'LL BLOW PEOPLE AWAY AT A CAR SHOW. - So it does look good? - DUDE, IT'S AMAZING. IT'S NOT A COLOR YOU'RE GOING TO FIND ON ANY CAR ANYWHERE. SO, BEFORE WE GET OFF, ARE WE GOOD? Well, I'm not going to lie to you. I'm a little nervous, man, seriously. THAT'S A GOOD THING. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS ABOUT IT, MAYBE WE'RE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING. MAYBE WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING COOL. I am nervous, but if you say it looks good, I mean, I'm still nervous. - YEAH. - I'm excited, though. - I'm glad it's with you. - TAKE A COUPLE DEEP BREATHS. RELAX. GO DRINK A BEER. Yeah, next week for sure, right? SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. BETTER GET YOUR HOT SHOES ON. WE'RE GOING TO GO FLYING AROUND THE TRACK. - Thanks, man. - ALL RIGHT. THAT GUY'S CRAZY. ALL RIGHT. SHE'S BACK IN YOUR HANDS NOW. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR FAST, LEAN, MEAN AND COMFORTABLE. WE'VE GOT FAST AND LEAN AND MEAN TAKEN CARE OF. WE NEED SOME COMFORT. KEEP THEM COMFORTABLE, THAT'S WHAT THE AC'S FOR. THE LAST PIECE OF THIS MUSTANG PROJECT IS THE INTERIOR, SO I'M GOING TO MEET WITH BRYAN AND GET THIS ROLLING BECAUSE TIME IS A-TICKING. SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT UP TO YOU WITH THE INTERIOR. THIS ONE NEEDS TO BE PRETTY SIMPLE. WE GOT THE RACING BUCKETS WITH THE SIDE BOLSTERS. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST DITCH THE BACK SEAT, THROW A STEREO IN THERE BECAUSE YOU GOT THE ROLL CAGE IN THERE. NOBODY IS GOING TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT ANYWAY. I THINK KEEP SOME STOCK DOOR PANELS IN. THINK WE GOT IT COVERED. ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF? NO, I LIKE IT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. NOAH SAID HE WANTS THIS MUSTANG TO BE LEAN AND MEAN. WE'RE WORKING ON A SPEAKER BOX FOR THE MUSTANG. WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP IT SIMPLE AND SLEEK. IT OUGHT TO FIT RIGHT IN WITH WHAT NOAH WANTS FOR THIS CAR. KICK PANELS FOR THE MUSTANG, I'M JUST GOING TO ADD JUST SOME VINYL REAL QUICK. ONCE IT'S TOGETHER, IT'LL LOOK REALLY GOOD. [ AIR HISSES ] ** AFTER 13 LONG YEARS OF NOT A WHOLE LOT HAPPENING, I THINK LAUREN'S FATHER IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO LOVE THIS COBRA. [ ENGINE REVS ] - WELL... - HOLY COW. ...WHAT DO YOU THINK? - I THINK... - IT'S TOGETHER. - YES. - AND IT RUNS. Noah and Bob: WOW. WHEN I FIRST HEARD MY CAR COME UP THE DRIVEWAY, I THOUGHT, "OH, MY GOD. IT FINALLY IS HERE." IT HAS A SWEET PAINT JOB... - YES, IT DOES. - ...AND A BRAND-NEW INTERIOR. YES. - WOW. - WOW. BEAUTIFUL. WE'VE PUT SOME TEST MILES ON IT, GONE BACK OVER THROUGH, NUT AND BOLT THE WHOLE CAR, MADE SURE EVERYTHING'S TIGHT AND BLED THE BRAKES. BEAUTIFUL. - SHE'S ALL YOURS... - IT'S BEAUTIFUL. ...READY TO ENJOY RIGHT IN TIME FOR SPRING. BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL. WANT ME TO SHOW YOU THE INTERIOR? YES. I THINK IT TURNED OUT PRETTY NICE. OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. ALL-NEW CARPETING, ALL-NEW SEAT COVERS, GOT SOME NICE RACING HARNESSES IN. WELL, I EXPECTED IT TO BE NICE, BUT THIS GOES PAST WHAT I EXPECTED. - YEAH. - IT IS BEAUTIFUL. I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. AWESOME. THE PAINT'S GREAT. THE INTERIOR IS GREAT. NO QUESTION, THE PAINT IS BEAUTIFUL. TWO BASE COATS AND THEN FIVE COATS OF CLEAR. WE'VE SANDED IT ALL DOWN, SO IT'S NICE AND FLAT. THERE'S NO TEXTURE ON THE PAINT. IT'S A REALLY NICE SHOW-CAR FINISH. YOU CAN TAKE IT TO A SHOW AND BE PROUD. YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT REALLY QUICK? - YEAH. - BEAUTIFUL. LIGHTWEIGHT CAR, BIG MOTOR, CAN'T BEAT THAT. TRY IT ON FOR SIZE. I WAS WATCHING MY DAD, AND HE JUST LIT UP LIKE A LITTLE KID ON CHRISTMAS. TO SEE IT ALL PUT TOGETHER IS PERFECT. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. YEAH. YOU CAN START WITH A TEST DRIVE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ ENGINE REVS ] WOW. - [ LAUGHS ] - COME ON, DAUGHTER. HE WANTS TO HUG YOU. THANK YOU. [ ENGINE REVS ] BOY, IT FEELS GOOD. - IT SOUNDS GOOD, FEELS GOOD. - YEAH. IT'S, LIKE, RIGHT AMOUNT OF POWER. THIS IS, LIKE, THE PERFECT DRIVING ROAD FOR THIS CAR. - OH, YEAH, YEAH. - YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS. WELL, YOU LOOKED LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE WHEN I PULLED UP, SO I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S GOOD FOR US." I WISH ALL THE GUYS IN THE SHOP COULD'VE SEEN IT. YEAH, I'VE HAD A LOT OF SPORTS CARS, BUT THIS... - THIS IS THE REAL... - ...THIS DRIVES BETTER. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW LONG I'VE WAITED FOR THIS. SO MANY TIMES I WALKED PAST THIS CAR IN THE GARAGE AND THOUGHT, "YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO GET OFF OF YOUR ASS AND TAKE CARE OF IT." THE WHOLE PICTURE IS AWESOME, AND THERE'S NOT ONE PART OF IT THAT I LOVE MORE THAN ANY OF IT. ARE YOU HAPPY? - I'M VERY HAPPY. DO YOU LOVE THE COLOR? BEAUTIFUL. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN YOU SMILE THAT BIG. JUST SEEING HIM JUST ABSOLUTELY HAPPY IS WORTH IT. I'M IN MY GLORY. WHAT'S UP, DUSTIN? WHAT'S UP, MAN? I WANT TO THROW A LAST-MINUTE DETAIL IN. SO THERE'S 2 DAYS LEFT IN JAMES' MUSTANG BUILD, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOING TO STOP COMING UP WITH NEW IDEAS. WE TRY TO CUSTOMIZE OUR CARS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL. Charles: WELL, I WAS WALKING AROUND THIS CAR EARLIER, AND, I MEAN, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CUSTOM TOUCHES THAT WE DID. I WANT YOU TO MAKE A CUSTOM SHIFTER LEVER FOR THIS CAR. - MACHINE IT? - MACHINE IT. AND YOU GOT ABOUT 4 HOURS TO DO IT. INDEX HOLES LIKE THIS, LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL BASICALLY SO IT MATCHES. OKAY. YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT. I WANT YOUR INPUT ON THE HANDLE, THE KNOB ITSELF. - YOU CAN SAND IT AND PAINT IT. - WHAT COLOR? PROBABLY BLACK KNOB AND MAYBE DO THE SHIFTER HANDLE IN THE ARGENT COLOR. - YOU'RE COOL WITH THE DESIGN? - YEAH. YEAH. YOU'RE NOT COOL WITH THE TIME, BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT. - YOU READY? - IT'S LUNCHTIME. YOU DON'T HAVE A **** WATCH. BUT I KNOW IT'S LUNCHTIME. CHARLES WANTS TO DO A CUSTOM SHIFTER HANDLE FOR JAMES' MUSTANG, SO I'VE GOT A ROUGH TEMPLATE CUT OUT HERE, AND I'VE GOT SOME MATERIAL THAT WE'RE GOING TO CHOP IT OUT OF. OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW. CUSTOM SHIFTER HANDLE. CHARLES, IT'S DONE, DUDE. CHECK IT OUT. SEE WHAT YOU... WHAT THE **** IS THAT? I GUESS I SHOULD'VE GIVEN YOU A LITTLE MORE TIME, HUH? YEAH, YOU CAN SHIFT THIS THING FROM THE BACK SEAT WITH THIS. YEAH. DID YOU GET LUNCH YET? YOU'RE GOING TO EAT A PIECE OF ALUMINUM IN ABOUT 5 SECONDS. ** DROPPED THE KNOB BACK SO IT'D BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR JAMES TO DRIVE. I THINK IT LOOKS COOL, MAN. I THINK HE'S GOING TO LIKE IT. GET SOME HOLES DRILLED IN IT AND GET THE FINISH WORK DONE TO IT AND BE DONE WITH IT. ** Noah: SO IT'S FINAL ASSEMBLY DAY ON THE MUSTANG, AND WE HAVE A TON OF STUFF TO DO, THE TRUNK, THE HOOD, AND WE STILL HAVE TO TUNE THE ENTIRE CAR. ALL RIGHT. OH, THAT FITS LIKE ****. GOT THE POP-OUT, SWING-OUT, SIDE-IMPACT BAR, AND WE PUT THE PINS IN THE FRONT, AND THE REAR IS NOT LINING UP, SO WE GOT TO DRILL IT OUT, REAM IT OUT A LITTLE BIT. GOT TO GET IT TO WORK A LITTLE SMOOTHER. LOOK, WE'LL GET THROUGH IT, MAN. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. DOWNTOWN. THE TRUNK ISN'T WORKING, SO NOW I'VE GOT TO TAKE ALL THIS INTERIOR OUT DOWN HERE AND THEN GOT TO TRACK THIS RED WIRE AND SEE WHERE IT GOES. CARPET, ROLL CAGE, EVERYTHING IS IN THE WAY. THIS CAR HAS BEEN FIGHTING US ALL DAY LONG. IT'S BEEN HEADACHE AFTER HEADACHE, PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM, BUT WE'RE GOING TO STAY ALL NIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET THIS CAR DONE. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TAKES. THIS SWITCH DON'T FREAKING WORK. HUH. CHARLES! Charles: WHAT? HEY, WE GOT A CONUNDRUM. LEAVE IT TO A BODY GUY TO FIND OUT THAT THE REAR END IS WAY FAR TO ONE SIDE. ** LEAVE IT TO A BODY GUY TO FIND OUT THAT THE REAR END IS WAY FAR TO ONE SIDE. WHEN THEY LOWERED THE CAR, THEY THREW ALL THE ALIGNMENT OF THE REAR END OFF. THE INNER SIDE, YOU GOT, LIKE, 1/8 INCH OF CLEARANCE ON THIS SIDE, AND THERE'S, LIKE, A FULL INCH OR MORE ON THAT SIDE. ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME? WHAT? STILL TRYING TO PUT THE FRONT END TOGETHER. THIS IS THE LAST THING WE NEED. IT'S LATE. EVERYBODY IS TIRED. NOW, I HAVE TO FIX IT. GIVE ME THAT DAMN FLASHLIGHT. WELL, I DIDN'T SAY YOU HAD TO FIX IT. WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE SUPER LATE NOW. [ SQUEAKS ] - RIGHT HERE. - RIGHT HERE. THAT'S WORKING PRETTY GOOD. BUT LET'S GO UP AN INCH. DON'T YOU LOVE THESE LATE-NIGHT MAD THRASHES? THE PROBLEMS ON THE REAR END HERE WERE NOT QUITE AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT, 20, 30 MINUTES OF ADJUSTMENT. WE GOT IT DONE. IT HAD TO BE DONE. FIX IT. WE MOVE ON. ** James: HEY, THIS IS KICK-ASS DRIVING ON THIS TRACK, MAN. I LOVE YOUR TRUCK, MAN. - I HAD TO PULL A COUPLE STRINGS. - YEAH. BUT I GOT THE WHOLE TRACK CLOSED DOWN FOR YOU, SO WE CAN TEST THIS PUPPY OUT THE RIGHT WAY, THE WAY WE LIKE TO DO IT. MAN, THAT'S BADASS. THIS MUSTANG IS AWESOME. MY GUYS WORKED ALL NIGHT LONG PERFECTING IT. I THINK JAMES IS GOING TO LOSE HIS ****. THERE IT IS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? - THERE YOU GO. - OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? THIS THING LOOKS FREAKING TOUGH AS NAILS. HOLY ****. WHAT DO YOU THINK? BETTER THAN WHITE? YOU WANTED TO KEEP IT WHITE. OH, MY GOD. YOU WERE GOING TO KEEP IT WHITE, JAMES. DUDE, HOLY ****. GOD. WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, IT'S INSANE. IT IS **** INSANE. LOOK HOW TOUGH THAT THING LOOKS. OH, MY GOD. WE USED YOUR CRAZY HOOD, WHICH DID NOT WANT TO WORK, BUT DAN WORKED HIS MAGIC ON THE HOOD. HOLY ****. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. YEP. IT IS BADASS. AND YOU GUYS NAILED IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PAINT COLOR? I DO LIKE THE COLOR AFTER ALL. IT IS WILD. I KNOW I'VE BEEN A NERVOUS WRECK. BUT ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE SAME CAR? IT'S THE SAME CAR. OH, MY GOD. YOUR EBAY PURCHASE HAS COME FULL CIRCLE. - OH, MY GOD. - OH, YEAH. IT'S GOT A TOTALLY UNIQUE LOOK. THE WHEEL-AND-TIRE COMBO WORKED OUT WELL, GOT BIG BRAKES ALL THE WAY AROUND. - MM-HMM. - COILOVER SETUP. YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE INTERIOR REAL QUICK? YES. YES. OH, THE FREAKING ROLL BAR TURNED OUT BADASS. YEP, GOT ALL YOUR GAUGES ALL SET UP, SUPER TRICK SHIFTER, NICE RACE SEATS. YOU EVEN HAVE AIR CONDITIONING TO KEEP YOU COOL. THIS LOOKS KILLER, MAN. THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE. THIS TURNED OUT REALLY SLICK. I MEAN, THIS IS ONE-OFF. NO ONE ELSE HAS THIS. - BRYAN MADE THAT FROM SCRATCH. - BEAUTIFUL. James: YEAH, LET'S CHECK OUT THE MOTOR, MAN. YEAH. I'LL HAVE TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE DID UP HERE. THIS IS FREAKING COOL. - OH, WOW. SO WE GOT A 347 STROKER... - YEAH. - ...WITH THE BLOWER. WE'VE MANAGED TO INTEGRATE AIR CONDITIONING INTO THIS WHOLE DEAL, WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. THIS THING HAULS ASS DOWN THE ROAD AND COLD AIR CONDITIONING. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO KEEP YOU HAPPY AND PAMPERED. [ LAUGHS ] I THINK SO. WELL, I'M HIGH-MAINTENANCE, MAN. I'M A HOT MESS. WE KNOW IT. WE KNOW IT. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. MAN, YOU GUYS NAILED IT. - WE LIKED IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YEP. - OH, MY GOD. SO WE GOT THE WHOLE TRACK CLOSED DOWN, HAD TO PULL A COUPLE STRINGS, BUT WE SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO. WE CAN TEST THIS THING, SEE IF IT DOES IT. THEY'RE GOING TO LET US DRIVE ON THIS TRACK? WE'RE GOING TO DRIVE ON THE TRACK, TEST IT AT SPEED AND SHAKE IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND SEE WHAT SHE'S MADE OF. THEY HAVE SEEN HOW I DRIVE, RIGHT? THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. OKAY. GOOD BECAUSE, IN TEXAS, WE HAUL ASS. DUDE, I'M GOING TO TEAR THIS **** UP. ** - OH, MY GOD! WOO! - WHAT DO YOU THINK? SHE IS SICK, MAN, SICK! THAT THING COOKS AROUND THE TRACK. THE GUYS DID A GREAT JOB ON THIS CAR. I'VE GOT THE OLD-SCHOOL LOOK, YOU KNOW, WITH THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY, THE SUSPENSION, THE BRAKES, THE DRIVETRAIN, THE INTERIOR, THE SEATS, THE ROLL BARS, EVERYTHING. I MEAN, IT'S TOP-NOTCH. DONE NICE, DONE NICE. IT'S A SCREAMER. - THANKS, MAN. - YEAH. GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. - AWESOME. - DAMN, DUDE. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
