 - DANIEL-SAN? - WHAT'S UP? PAINT THE FENCE. OH, NO. TWO VERY DIFFERENT CLASSIC FORDS. YOU PULL THIS THING OUT OF A LAKE? I DID. A '53 RUST BUCKET IS PULLED FROM THE SWAMP.

 KIND OF LACKING A LITTLE OFF THE LINE. IT'S OUT WITH THE OLD... THE ONLY THING WE'RE AFTER IS GETTING THE CAB OFF THE CHASSIS AND PUSHING THE REST OUTSIDE. ...AND IN WITH THE NEW... THE VALVE COVER'S IS HITTING THE FIREWALL. WELL, THAT DOG DON'T HUNT. ...TO GIVE THIS TRUCK A NEW LIFE... HIT IT. I THINK THIS ONE WOULD LOOK REALLY GOOD IN MY GARAGE. ...AND SEND A MUSTANG FLYING. IT ROARS LIKE A LION. MAKING A CAR LOOK GOOD -- FOR US, THAT'S A GIVEN.

 MAKING A CAR PERFORM -- THAT'S OUR SPECIALTY. HERE AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO, MY TEAM OF VISIONARIES AND MASTER CRAFTSMEN TAKE CARS OF ALL KINDS AND TRANSFORM THEM INTO CUSTOM-TAILORED, HIGH-PERFORMANCE RIDES. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS AND HAUL ASS? WE'RE THE SHOP FOR YOU. BECAUSE HERE, SPEED IS THE NEW BLACK. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS OH, NO. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THING? I'VE GOT A CLIENT COMING TODAY. HIS NAME IS ROB. HE'S GONNA BRING IN HIS OLD PICKUP TRUCK. NO IDEA WHAT'S IN STORE FOR US THERE. YOU PULL THIS THING OUT OF A LAKE? I DID. WELL, I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. IT'S SAFE TO SAY WE'VE PROBABLY STARTED WITH WORSE, MAYBE NOT THAT MUCH WORSE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS THING IN THE END? '53 WAS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORD. - RIGHT. - AND I JUST LOVE THIS TRUCK. I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF IT. - OKAY. PASS IT ON FOR GENERATIONS. I REALLY WANT TO TRANSFORM THIS THING INTO A REALLY MEAN AND GREEN MACHINE. IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF GREEN TO MAKE IT MEAN. OKAY. I WANT THIS TRUCK TO BE BADASS. I WANT IT TO BE LOW, I WANT IT TO BE LOUD. I WANT IT TO HAVE A PRESENCE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IT'S THERE, AND NOT TO MESS WITH THAT TRUCK. IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, THIS THING IS KIND OF SLOW AND TOUGH. IF WE JUST TOOK THE CAB, WE COULD PUT THIS THING ON AN ENTIRELY NEW CHASSIS. IF I CAN GO A LITTLE BIT FASTER... - YEAH. - ...THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. I STILL WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAUL MY DOG AROUND AND MAYBE TAKE IT TO THE STORE. LET'S CHECK OUT THE BED. WOW. IT'S NOT IN TOO BAD A SHAPE. I MEAN, SOME OF IT'S STILL THERE ANYWAY. I THINK YOU MIGHT ALSO HAVE A TERMITE PROBLEM. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP A WOOD BED. THAT BED'S SEEN SOME HARDER DAYS, BUT BEING 70 YEARS OLD, YOU WOULD EXPECT IT TO KIND OF LOOK LIKE THAT. MECHANICALLY, THIS THING'S STILL WORKING PRETTY GOOD. I MEAN, THE WINDOWS ARE ACTUALLY STILL ROLLING DOWN. RIGHT. THE SEAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK. COMFORT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THIS THING DRIVE LIKE A NEWER TRUCK. I'M GONNA GIVE THESE GUYS A LOT OF FREEDOM TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN IDEAS AND MOVE THAT FORWARD, AND HOPEFULLY KEEPING MY VISION IN MIND, MAKE THIS TRUCK BADASS. WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU, YOU WANT TO RETAIN SOME OF THIS ORIGINAL DESIGN AND STYLING, BUT IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE SAME TRUCK WHATSOEVER. AND A LITTLE MORE HORSEPOWER? A LOT MORE HORSEPOWER. YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO KEEP SOME OF THESE CLASSIC LOOKS, BUT PERFORMANCE-WISE, I THINK WE'RE GONNA BLOW YOU AWAY. I ENVISION WALKING IN AND SEEING THAT TRUCK WITH A NEW, FRESH LOOK. LOUD, POWERFUL, SOMETHING THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO DRIVE AND BE PROUD OF FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET ON IT AND MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOU GUYS CAN'T UNSEE. TYPICALLY WHEN WE SEE A TRUCK LIKE THIS, IT'S KIND OF COOL FROM 20 FEET AWAY, BUT UPON CLOSER INSPECTION, THEY'RE PRETTY GNARLY. THERE SHE IS, THE SWAMP CREATURE. DOES HE WEAR A STRAW HAT WHEN HE DRIVES IT? I MEAN, I KIND OF LIKE THE FLAVOR THAT'S GOING ON HERE, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT HE WANTS. HE WANTS SOMETHING THAT'S RELIABLE. HE WANTS IT TO HANDLE WELL. I THINK FOR ROB'S TRUCK, WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS THREE-QUARTER-TON CHASSIS. WE'LL PUT THAT F-250 CAB ON A MORE MODERN HALF-TON CHASSIS. SO THEN IT'S GONNA BECOME AN F-100. WE'RE ESSENTIALLY GONNA MAKE THIS THING HANDLE LIKE A NICE MUSCLE CAR. WE'LL GET ALL-NEW METAL, PUT IT ON A BADASS NEW CHASSIS. BIG BRAKES, NICE SUSPENSION STUFF, CLEAN UP THE STYLING A LITTLE BIT. BASICALLY GAVE US COMPLETE ARTISTIC FREEDOM. WE GOTTA PAINT IT GREEN. BEYOND THEN, I'M GONNA LEAN ON YOU GUYS TO COME UP WITH SOME COOL TO DO ON IT. IT'S GREEN, LOOK AT THE BACK WINDOW. IT'S GREEN. - IT'S ACTUALLY MOLDY. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT TRUCK FOR A BUNCH OF CUSTOM METALWORK YOU CAN TURN OUT. BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT CREATIVE FREEDOM TO DO WHATEVER WE WANT, IT CAN KIND OF GO BOTH WAYS. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF WE CAN TURN SOMETHING OUT, AND IT'S JUST TOTALLY OVER THE TOP AND A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, AND THE CUSTOMER LIKES IT, THAT'S AWESOME FOR US AS A SHOP. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT SOME MILD EXTERIOR MODS THAT'LL CLEAN THIS BODY UP A LITTLE BIT? I THINK WE NEED TO LOSE THE FRONT BUMPER. CUT THE ENDS OF THE FRAME OFF, AND THEN WE'LL MAKE A CUSTOM INSERT, LIKE A LOWER GRILLE AND THAT VALANCE. SHAVED BUMPER WITH, LIKE, AN INLET TYPE. - RIGHT. - THAT COULD BE COOL. HE WANTS A WOOD BED. I THINK WE CAN DO SOMETHING COOL WITH THAT. YOU HAVE TO SAND IT DOWN REAL NICE. WHAT'S IT GOT, AN OLD FLATHEAD IN IT? YEAH. DUDE, NO FLATHEAD. NO. LOOKS LIKE A Y-BLOCK. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS THING NEEDS? A BOSS 302 CRATE ENGINE WITH A 5-SPEED TRANSMISSION. I WANT TO BUILD A TRUCK FOR ROB THAT'S GONNA BE RELIABLE AND COMFORTABLE AND PERFORM WELL. OH, DUDE, THE FLOOR PANS ARE NICE. ROCK SOLID, YEAH. I MEAN, I THINK AT LEAST WE HAVE A GOOD CAB TO WORK WITH. I LIKE THIS TRUCK. I THINK THIS TRUCK WOULD BE A BITCH BUILD. YEAH. HOW DO YOU GET SUCH A PATINA'D TRUCK, LOOKS LIKE HE DRUG IT OUT OF THE SALTWATER, BUT THERE'S NO RUST HOLES? - IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD TRUCK. - I THINK SO. IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE STRIP IT DOWN TO BARE METAL. NO DENTS, NO DINGS IN THE CAB. LIFT THE CAB OFF AND ROLL THE CHASSIS OUT FROM UNDER IT. SO WE GOT A WHOLE TRUCK HERE, BEAUTIFUL PATINA, IT LOOKS JUST CRAZY, BUT BEING A THREE-QUARTER-TON LONG BED, WE DON'T WANT NONE OF THAT. THE ONLY THING WE'RE AFTER IS GETTING THE CAB OFF THE CHASSIS AND PUSHING THE REST OUTSIDE. THERE'S SOME COW DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF LITTLE HIDDEN TREASURES IN EVERY CAR. YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE UNTIL YOU REALLY TEAR INTO 'EM. BIG RAT TURDS IN THERE, MAN. DON'T STICK YOUR HAND IN YOUR MOUTH. HOLD ON! WE FOUND THE MOUSE HOUSE. OOH, IS THAT A RAT TAIL? -DAMN IT, MAN. EASIER TO CLEAN UP IS THE RAT POOP. WE JUST SCRAPE IT AND SWEEP IT ON AWAY. THE RUST HOLES, YOU KNOW, WE GOTTA CUT THAT OUT AND WELD IN THE METAL. HAD A LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT ONCE WE GOT IT ALL CLEANED UP, BUT IT'S STILL A VERY SAVABLE CAB. AS YOU SEE, IT'S RUSTED OUT, AS WELL. NOW WE GOTTA SLIDE THIS NEW BRACKET UP INSIDE HERE BEFORE WE COULD PUT OUR EXTERIOR CAB CORNER ON. LOOK AT THAT. I'M TIRED OF THIS POOP. THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL A POOPY JOB. YEAH, EXACTLY, AND WE GOT IT. THE HILL'S ICY. WE GOT THE '53 FORD CAB BACK FROM SANDBLASTING, AND IT'S TIME TO SEE WHAT THE REAL DAMAGE IS LIKE. BODY SHOP OR FAB SHOP? I DON'T KNOW, LET'S CHECK IT OUT. IT'S A LOT WORSE THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT. REALLY? I MEAN, YOU GOT RUST BACK HERE IN THE FLOOR. THIS MOUNT, THE FLOOR MOUNT THERE IS RUSTED OUT. CAB CORNER, THIS ROCKER. YEAH. THIS CAB MOUNT UP HERE IS GONE. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOOD. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING STRAIGHT INTO BODY. I KNOW. I DID, TOO. WE CAN'T SEND IT OVER TO THE BODY SHOP LIKE THIS. WE GOTTA GET THIS ALL PATCHED UP FIRST. - ALL RIGHT. - ALL RIGHT. FAB SHOP. SO, WE'VE GOT A LITTLE MORE RUST THAN WE WANTED TO SEE ON THIS BODY AFTER WE BLASTED IT, BUT WE CAN FIX IT ALL, SO IT'S GONNA GO TO THE FAB SHOP, GET PATCHED UP, AND WE'LL MOVE ONTO BODYWORK. WOW. FIRST SHOT, THAT'S NOT BAD. I'VE GOT THE WHOLE CAB CORNER CUT OUT. I'VE GOT ALL THE RUST CLEANED UP BEHIND IT. AND NOW I CAN START FITTING THE NEW CAB CORNER AND WELDING IT IN PLACE. TODAY I HAVE A LOCAL CUSTOMER, LENNY, WHO'S BRINGING IN A 1967 MUSTANG ELEANOR FOR A FEW CUSTOM TOUCHES. SO, LAST TIME I SAW YOU, YOU WERE DRIVING A 911 TURBO. THAT'S CORRECT. AND NOW YOU'RE DRIVING A REALLY, REALLY COOL GT 500 CONVERTIBLE DONE IN THE ELEANOR STYLE, WHICH I LOVE. WHAT'S THE STORY THERE? WELL, I THOUGHT THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE GAS TANK OF THE 911. TALKING WITH SOME BUDDIES, AND THEY KEEP SEEING MY WIFE OUT DRIVING AROUND. - OH! - IN THE PORSCHE. ALL RIGHT. SO, SHE'S KIND OF TAKEN OVER THAT CAR. - RIGHT. - WHICH OPENED UP A SPOT FOR ME. FOR A NEW TOY? TO GET A NEW TOY, FOR SURE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A WISE CHOICE. YOU COULD PROBABLY STILL DRIVE THE 911 EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, RIGHT? WHEN I GET PERMISSION. - WHEN YOU GET PERMISSION. - EXACTLY. - IT'S NOT EVEN YOURS ANYMORE. - NO. SO, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, FORD NEVER ACTUALLY MADE AN ELEANOR MUSTANG, BUT THEY WERE MADE FAMOUS BY THE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THE "GONE IN 60 SECONDS" MOVIES. IN THE LAST "GONE IN 60 SECONDS," THE ELEANOR WAS A HIGHLY MODIFIED GT 500, AND THAT'S WHAT LENNY HAS. THIS THING RUNS PRETTY WELL. - YEAH. - I LIKE IT. IT FEELS LIKE THE HANDLING IS PRETTY NICE. IT'S SLAMMED DOWN ON THE GROUND. IT'S GOT A GREAT STANCE. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT DOING TO IT? WELL, I LIKE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC, AND -- OKAY. IT'S HARD TO HEAR. I MEAN, YOU GOT THE EXHAUST THAT COMES OUT THE SIDE, AND OF COURSE, THE TOP DOWN. VERY, VERY QUICKLY DROWNS OUT THE STEREO. I ALSO FEEL THAT THERE'S A -- KIND OF LACKING A LITTLE OFF THE LINES. I THINK I HAVE A GOOD IDEA, SO IN "GONE IN 60 SECONDS," THAT CAR HAS A NITROUS BUTTON ON IT. A LOT OF PEOPLE GO WITH THE TURBO, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE GO WITH THE SUPERCHARGER-TYPE SETUP, BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SIMPLISTIC, AND IT'S GOT A COOL TIE-IN THERE BEING THAT IT IS AN ELEANOR CAR. - RIGHT. - HIT THAT BUTTON AND FLOOR IT, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A NICE LITTLE BOOST. I THINK IT'D BE FUN FOR YOU. - YEAH. WE'RE ALL ABOUT SPEED AND PERFORMANCE, SO IT'S DEFINITELY RIGHT UP OUR ALLEY. I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT I'M MISSING. I'M WILLING TO LOOK INTO. I'M EXCITED TO PUT THIS NITROUS ON THE CAR BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE JUST LIKE THE CAR HAD IN THE MOVIE. MAYBE LENNY WILL JUST HIT THE BUTTON ALL THE WAY TO WORK ALL DAY LONG, I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW OFTEN HE COMES BACK FOR A REFILL. SO THE NEW CHASSIS ARRIVED FOR THE '53 FORD TODAY, SO IT'S TIME TO GET EVERYTHING MOCKED UP. - IT'S NICE. - YEAH. FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS TODAY IS WE'RE GONNA GET THE REAR-END MOCKED UP. THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE. GETTING HOT NOW. WHY DON'T WE GET THE CAB ON THIS THING SO WE CAN START PUTTING THE FRONT END ON IT? ALL RIGHT, THAT'S COOL. WE'RE REGROUPING. I'M COOL. - WATCH YOUR FINGERS. - YEP. - THAT'S GOOD. - WE'RE GOOD HERE. YEAH, COOL. FITS RIGHT IN THERE, HUH? HERE WE GOT A NICE LITTLE 302 FROM FORD RACING. BADASS FRAME WE GOT UNDERNEATH IT, IT SHOULD COMPLEMENT THAT TRUCK VERY WELL. HERE YOU GO, HEY. WE'RE GONNA MOCK THIS ENGINE IN THE CHASSIS, THEN WE'RE GONNA FIT THE SHEET METAL AROUND IT AND MAKE SURE THERE'S NO CLEARANCE PROBLEMS. EASY, YEAH. LOWER IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT. WE GOT A PROBLEM. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. INTAKE AND THAT VALVE COVER IS HITTING THE FIREWALL. HEY, NOAH. NOAH. YOU GOT A SECOND? THE VALVE COVER'S HITTING THE FIREWALL. WELL, THAT DOG DON'T HUNT. WE'RE TRYING TO PUT THE ENGINE IN. WE'RE OFF A HALF INCH TO GET IT IN THE FRAME MOUNTS, AND THE FIREWALL'S HITTING. YEAH, THAT'S A BUNCH OF HOURS. I'VE KIND OF BEEN LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO GET RID OF THIS FIREWALL. GIVE SCOTT SOMETHING TO DO. THE MTO OR IS ACTUALLY HITTING THE FIREWALL ON THE FORD TRUCK, SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE IT BACK A LITTLE BIT, CUT THE FIREWALL OUT, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY COOL AND CUSTOM FOR ROB. YOU GET YOUR WISH. YOU GET TO DO MORE CUSTOM METALWORK. THIS THING DOESN'T FIT, SO YOU GOTTA BUILD A NEW FIREWALL FOR THIS. A WHOLE FIREWALL, OR JUST NOTCH THAT. JUST BUILD A WHOLE FIREWALL. HERE'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT. THE CAB IN THESE THINGS ARE PRETTY SMALL, SO YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT YOU'VE GOT AN INCH TO WORK WITH. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO COME BACK A WHOLE LOT 'CAUSE ONCE THE SEAT'S IN THERE, THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE IN THESE THINGS. THE MOTOR DON'T FIT, WE GOTTA PUSH THE MOTOR BACK, BUT YOU AIN'T GIVING ME NO ROOM TO WORK. -I'M GIVING YOU AN INCH. IT'S GOTTA GO BACK AN INCH. JUST DON'T GET CRAZY AND GO BACK, LIKE, FOUR INCHES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SO, IT MIGHT NOT BE EASY TO ONLY HAVE AN INCH TO WORK WITH, BUT SCOTT'S USED TO IT. CHOP CHOP. CHOPPY CHOP CHOP. I'LL TRY TO PENCIL YOU IN. WE'RE GETTING READY TO CUT THE WHOLE FIREWALL SECTION OUT, CUSTOM BEAD ROLL, BE REAL CLEAN AND FANCY. SCOTT? I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU LAST WEEK NOT TO MAKE ANY MORE CAR PARTS OUT OF CARDBOARD. -THIS ISN'T GONNA HELP ANYBODY. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE CARDBOARD AT LEAST TWICE THIS THICK. THIS THING'S GONNA CRUMPLE GOING DOWN THE ROAD. IT'S NOT A FIREWALL. THIS IS AN ON-FIREWALL. ME BEING A COMPANY MAN REALIZING HOW MUCH THE STEEL IS COSTING YOU, I THOUGHT THE CARDBOARD WOULD BE A MUCH CHEAPER ROUTE. THIS IS THE CRAPPIEST FIREWALL I'VE EVER SEEN. ALL RIGHT, REMEMBER THE RULE. WE GOT AN INCH TO WORK WITH 'CAUSE THIS CAB DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S SETTING WAY BACK FAR. YEAH. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE SAME LOCATION THAT IT WAS. - AWESOME. - COOL. LOOKS GOOD, MAN. THANK YOU. YOU GO RIDE SOMEBODY ELSE'S ASS. YOU WISH SOMEONE WAS RIDING YOUR ASS. WHAT I DID WAS I TOOK THAT CARDBOARD TEMPLATE AND LAID IT OUT ON THE SHEET METAL, TRACED ALL AROUND IT. I GOT THESE LITTLE TABS THAT I'M GONNA BREAK UP TO MAKE IT FIT INTO THE FIREWALL REAL NICE AND TIGHT. SO, TO GIVE LENNY'S MUSTANG A NICE PERFORMANCE BOOST, WE'RE GONNA ADD A NITROUS KIT. NITROUS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE POWER ADDER TO PUT ON, AND IT'S PRETTY COST-EFFECTIVE. WHAT I HAVE HERE IS THE TRUNK PANEL FOR THE ELEANOR MUSTANG. GONNA BOLT THE BOTTOM OF THAT. BRYAN MADE THIS REALLY COOL FALSE FLOOR SO THE GUY CAN TAKE IT IN AND OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO UNBOLT IT FROM THE CAR. THERE WE GO, ALL BOLTED UP, READY TO SET IT IN THE CAR. WHAT I'M FISHING THROUGH HERE IS A NITROUS LINE FROM THE BOTTLE TO THE SOLENOID. WHEN I PULL THE SILL PLATE, I'M RUNNING THIS NITROUS FEED LINE RIGHT UPSIDE THIS CHANNEL. WE HAVE TO PUT NEW SPARK PLUGS IN WHEN YOU PUT NITROUS ON. YOU GOT TO GO TWO STEPS COLDER, SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE PLUGS OUT AND CHECK THE REST OF THE IGNITION TO MAKE SURE IT'S OKAY. YEAH. WHEELS ARE OUT. I'M GONNA PULL THE CAP OFF JUST TO DOUBLE-CHECK THAT. WHEN YOU HIT THAT NITROUS, YOU WANT EVERYTHING IN TUNE SO YOU DON'T HAVE NO MISFIRES OR ANYTHING. SO WHEN YOU ADD NITROUS OXIDE INTO AN ENGINE, AND IT'S HEATED, IT SPLITS INTO NITROGEN AND OXYGEN. AND WITH MORE OXYGEN, YOU CAN ADD MORE FUEL. WITH MORE FUEL, BOOM, LOTS MORE POWER FROM THE SAME ENGINE. GETTING READY TO REMOVE THE CARBURETOR TO PUT THE NITROUS PLATE ON THE INTAKE. BAD THING ABOUT NITROUS, THOUGH, SOMETIMES IT'S ADDICTING. IN ORDER TO ADAPT THIS TO THE CAR, WE GOTTA ASSEMBLE THIS PLATE, PUT OUR FUEL SOLENOID AND OUR NITROUS SOLENOID TO THE PLATE WHICH HAS A SPRAY BAR IN IT AND JETS ON EACH END. SO, I'M JUST GONNA SET IT ON THE CAR AND SET THE CARBURETOR BACK ON IT. YOU JUST WANT TO REALLY BE A LITTLE MORE THAN SNUG. 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT NO VACUUM LEAK. ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO. PLATE'S ON, SOLENOIDS ARE ON. JUST MADE THIS LITTLE BEZEL FOR THE NITROUS KIT. THIS IS THE ARMING SWITCH. GONNA HIDE IT IN THE ASHTRAY, AND ALL YOU DO IS FLIP IT DOWN, TURN IT ON, NITROUS IS READY TO ROCK AND ROLL. AND YOU SLIDE IT UP IN HERE LIKE THIS. ALL RIGHT, NOW FOR THE COOL PART. TURN THE KEY ON. ALL RIGHT. HE'S READY TO ROCK AND ROLL. THERE ARE A LOT OF LITTLE DECISIONS THAT GO INTO MAKING A REALLY COOL BUILD IN THE END. CASE IN POINT, WE'RE GONNA TAKE A TWO-PIECE GLASS SETUP IN THE WINDOW, DO A SINGLE PANE. IT'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE MODERN LOOK WHILE KEEPING THE OVERALL CLASSIC FEEL OF THIS TRUCK. AND IN ORDER TO GET THAT DONE, WE HAVE TO CUT THE DOOR OPEN AND REMOVE SOME OF THE INNER STRUCTURE SO THAT THE WINDOW CHANNEL HAS A PLACE TO GO INSIDE OF THE DOOR. COME ON. NOW I HAVE TO DRILL OUT ALL THESE SPOT WELDS TO GET THIS PIECE OUT OF HERE SO THAT MY WINDOW CHANNEL CAN FIT ALL THE WAY INSIDE OF THE DOOR CHANNEL HERE. JUST LIKE THAT. BEAUTIFUL. WHILE MOST PEOPLE FOCUS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE, OUR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME INSIDE. SO, I TOLD BRYAN TO GIVE THE PICKUP TRUCK A REALLY LUXURIOUS FEEL. I THINK ROB'S GONNA FLIP WHEN HE SEES IT. THESE ARE THE DOOR PANELS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE, LIKE, A THREE-EIGHTHS INCH PIECE OF METAL, ALUMINUM RUN THROUGH HERE, AND WE'LL HAVE IT PAINTED TO MATCH THE REST OF THE TRIM. SOME DIAMONDS THAT MATCH THE SEAT, AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO HERE IS WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FAKE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTOUR, SO THAT'LL LOOK REALLY GOOD, TOO. RAN OVER IT WITH A QUARTER-INCH FOAM, BUT WE WENT AHEAD AND SANDED IT DOWN. IT'LL REALLY ADD TO THE DETAIL ON THE TRUCK. OKAY, WE'VE SEWN THIS UP. WE JUST GOT THE SANDER OUT OF THE DOOR PANEL, WHICH WE ATTACH THIS BACK HERE, GIVE YOU AN IDEA WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEDSIDE FENDER. I BET IT'S THE DOOR. LET'S FIND OUT. ON THE FORD TRUCK, WE'RE REPLACING PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CAB. LUCKILY, LMC TRUCK MAKES MOST OF THESE PANELS, AND WHAT THEY DON'T MAKE, WE'RE GONNA MAKE CUSTOM, ANYWAY. - YOU GOT IT, SALLY? - SALLY? I GOT YOUR SALLY HERE. WE COULD SHOW UP PAUL WITH SOME OF THIS CARDBOARD. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS, IS WE'RE MOCKING UP THIS LMC TRUCK BED. SO THAT WAY, WE CAN PUT IT ON A FRAME AND SEE IF WE HAVE ANY FIT ISSUES, AND WE CAN MODIFY ANYTHING TO MAKE IT FIT WELL. OOH. WELL, I SEE A COUPLE PROBLEMS ALREADY. WHEELS AREN'T GONNA FIT. NOT EVEN CLOSE. BED. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RAISE THAT FLOOR ABOUT A GOOD... - 4 TO 5 INCHES. - 3 TO 5, YEAH. SINCE WE DECIDED TO USE SUCH BIG WHEEL AND TIRE COMBO, THE BED'S NOT FITTING CORRECTLY NOW. WE GOTTA PICK OUR POISON. WE'RE KEEPING THE BIG WHEELS AND TIRES, SO WE'RE CUTTING THE BED UP. SO, YEAH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET CHARLES OVER HERE. WELL, I SEE A COUPLE PROBLEMS ALREADY. WHEELS AREN'T GONNA FIT, BED. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RAISE THAT FLOOR ABOUT A GOOD... - THAT'S 4 OR 5 INCHES. - YEAH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET CHARLES OVER HERE. SO, EVEN WITH NEW PARTS, THINGS DON'T ALWAYS FIT TOGETHER THE WAY THEY SHOULD AND REQUIRE SOME MODIFICATION. BUT LUCKILY, THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE. IN ORDER TO GET THIS TRUCK TO SIT THE HEIGHT THAT WE WANT, WE'LL RAISE THE FLOOR UP, AND THEN WE CAN MAKE A NEW REAR SILL BACK HERE TO CLOSE UP THE BACK OF IT. AND THEN COME INSIDE HERE, WE'LL CUT IT. WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE WHEEL TUBS TO GO IN THERE. MAYBE WE'LL GO THROUGH AND HIDE THE FENDER FASTENERS. JUST MAKE THE INSIDE OF THE BED LOOK SUPER CLEAN AND STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL FLAIR OF THE WOOD FLOORS. IT'S GONNA LOOK NICE. - WE CAN DO IT. - COOL. - YOU'RE THE MAN. - THANKS, CHARLES. NO PROBLEM... BOYS. BOYS? HUH! HUH! WE'VE GOT MAGNAFLOW BUILDERS KIT HERE FOR ROB'S '53 FORD PICKUP TRUCK. WE GOT EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH ASSEMBLED ON THE FRAME, AND IT'S TIME TO GET GOING ON SOME EXHAUST FABRICATION. SO WE'RE GONNA RIP THIS THING OPEN AND SEE WHAT WE GOT TO PLAY WITH HERE. IT GIVES US ENOUGH HERE TO COMPLETELY FABRICATE A CUSTOM EXHAUST SYSTEM WITH THE OPTION OF HAVING DIFFERENT BENDS AND STUFF, SO WE CAN MINIMIZE HOW MANY CUTS WE MAKE. THE LESS CUTS, THE LESS WELDS, THE LESS TIME, BUT YOU'LL STILL HAVE A COMPLETELY CUSTOM FABRICATED EXHAUST SYSTEM WHEN WE'RE FINISHED. I'M BACK HERE DOING THE MUFFLERS, AND WE'RE KIND OF SPLITTING DUTIES. PAUL'S UP HELPING ME OUT, AND HE'S ROCKING ON THE HEADERS AND GONNA START WORKING FROM THE FRONT BACK TO THE MUFFLERS. AND ONCE I GET THESE HUNG UP, I'LL PROBABLY GO OVER THE AXLE AND TRY TO GET OUR EXHAUST OUT THE BACK SO WE CAN GET THE BED MOCKED UP ON THE TRUCK. THAT GOT IT. - YEAH. WHAT I JUST TACKED IN PLACE THERE IS OUR TEMPORARY JIG TO HOLD THE MUFFLERS LEVEL WITH EACH OTHER. YOU FIND DOING EXHAUST WORK AND FABRICATION, YOU NEVER HAVE ENOUGH HANDS. SO ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO MAKE THE JOB EASIER IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE. WE FOUND THIS WORKS THE BEST. YEAH. CUT IT OFF WHEN WE'RE DONE AND POLISH UP THE MUFFLER AGAIN, BE GOOD TO GO. GOING PRETTY GOOD. PAUL AND I GOT THE EXHAUST RAN BASICALLY FROM THE TAIL SHAFT SECTION OF THE TRANSMISSION ALL THE WAY BACK HERE. GOT US UP AND OVER THE REAR AXLE. THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE NOW FOR GETTING THE EXHAUST THROUGH THERE IS COMING UNDERNEATH THE TANK HERE, AS WELL AS DOING IT SAFELY TO HAVE GOOD CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE TANK AND THE EXHAUST. OUR CUSTOMER ON ELEANOR REQUESTED A STEREO SYSTEM, SO WE'RE MOLDING A SUB BOX IN THE TRUNK, A SET OF SPEAKERS DOWN IN THE KICK PANEL, AND WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME IN THE BACKSEAT. WE DIDN'T KNOW, NEITHER DID THE CUSTOMER, HE ACTUALLY HAD SPEAKERS IN THE BACK SEAT. SOMEBODY HAS ACTUALLY DRILLED A MILLION HOLES AND MOUNTED A TWEETER HERE, PRETTY MUCH GOES INTO NOWHERE. SO, WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THAT UP. WE'VE GOT SOME SPEAKERS HERE. THEY HAVE A NIFTY LITTLE TRICK THAT YOU CAN COMBINE THE TWEETER INTO THE SPEAKER. SO THAT SAVES A LOT OF SPACE. WE'VE CUT OUT, MADE A MESH GRILLE TO ALLOW THE SOUND TO COME OUT, AS OPPOSED TO HOW THEY HAD IT EARLIER. THIS WILL ACTUALLY BLEND IN WITH THE CAR A LITTLE BETTER THAN HAVING A BIG SPEAKER OR A MILLION LITTLE HOLES. WE'LL PUT THAT IN THERE, AND THAT'LL LOOK REALLY COOL. SO, I TOLD MARK TO COME UP WITH A COOL WAY TO ACCENT THE LIGHTS ON THE SIDE OF THIS TRUCK. AND AS MARK USUALLY DOES, HE IMMEDIATELY HAD AN IDEA. WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS TAIL LIGHT HERE. WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA CUT THE BUCKET AND JUST SLIDE IT OVER THE POST AND WELD IT UP. WELL, WE GOT THIS ALL MEASURED OUT, MARKED OUT WHERE WE WANT TO CUT IT. HOPEFULLY, IT'S RIGHT. THERE IT IS. FINE-TUNE IT SO IT'S ON THERE. GOT IT TACKED ON THERE AND READY TO WELD IT. JUST GIVES IT A NICE LOOK. ALL RIGHT, THANKS FOR COMING IN. - WOW. - IT'S COME A LONG WAY. SO, WE'VE GOT THE CAB ON THE NEW TCI CHASSIS. THIS HOOD, THIS ORIGINAL HOOD, FIT A LOT BETTER, SO WE'RE GOING WITH THAT. WE'VE GOT THE AFTER-MARKET FENDERS. WE'VE GOT THE RUNNING BOARDS TUCKED IN NICELY. HONESTLY, IT'S COMING TOGETHER. IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. I THOUGHT THEY'D BE A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG AT THIS POINT. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK. IT'S BOTHERING ME A LITTLE BIT. YEAH. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE TALKED TO ME SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THAT CHROME BUMPER. I CAN'T STAND THE FRONT BUMPER. THE MORE I LOOK AT IT, THE MORE I DISLIKE IT. IT STICKS OUT 5 FULL INCHES. HERE'S WHAT I'M PROPOSING. WOW. SO... YOU JUST GONNA PULL IT OFF THERE, HUH? I THINKING WE TAKE THIS FRONT BUMPER... YOU'RE GONNA REALLY GET RID OF THAT BUMPER. THAT'S ONE WAY TO GET RID OF IT. LOOK, WE'RE HALFWAY THERE. SO, NEXT IDEA. LET'S CUT THESE FRAME HORNS OFF, WE'LL FILL THESE IN. OKAY. IT'S GONNA GIVE IT A NICE, NEW, AGGRESSIVE LOOK. IT'LL GET RID OF OLD CHROMEY THERE. LET'S KEEP THE V-8, LOSE THIS BADGE. GOTTA KEEP THE V-8. EVERYBODY'S STILL GONNA KNOW WHAT IT IS. I LOVE THE V-8. PLUS, IT MATCHES THE REST OF THE "V" IN THE GRILLE. IT'S GONNA LOOK AWESOME. I'M EXCITED FOR THE NEW, MEAN LOOK. IF IT'S NOT TO MY LIKING, I'M DEFINITELY GONNA THROW SOMETHING AT NOAH. MAYBE THE BUMPER. DAN SPENT A LOT OF TIME ROCKING OUT DURING THE WORKDAY. I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT'S PRODUCTIVE OR NOT. IT'S HARD TO REALLY TELL. MAYBE HE'S JUST BLASTED THROUGH WORK. MAYBE HE'S ROCKING OUT SO HARD, HE'S NOT GETTING THAT MUCH DONE. I'M NOT REALLY SURE. HEY! SCHOOL OF ROCK, WHAT AM I PAYING YOU TO DO? HEY, SORRY, I'M GONNA PUT THIS TOGETHER. I JUST WAS -- IT'S A GOOD SONG, SO... - WHAT THE MAN. - HEY. - DOING ANY WORK? - HEY, GET BACK TO WORK, MAN. WHAT THE HELL AM I PAYING YOU FOR? SORRY. GOT CARRIED AWAY. - GOT THAT ONE SPOT PRETTY GOOD. - I SEE THAT. GETTING READY TO? SO, WE'RE TAKING A 1953 FORD TRUCK, KEEPING JUST THE CAB, CUSTOM MAKING EVERYTHING ELSE TO MAKE IT A MUSCLE TRUCK LIKE NO OTHER. THE BODY'S READY FOR PAINT, THE CHASSIS LOOKS GREAT. NOW IT'S TIME TO INSTALL OUR POWER PLANT. WE GOT THIS FINE PIECE OF JEWELRY BACK FROM PAINT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. 302 BOSS FROM FORD. IT'S THEIR MAGIC BULLET, SO TO SPEAK. EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THE 302, AND THEN WHEN THE BOSS CAME INTO PLAY, THAT WAS WHEN THEY WERE GETTING INTO THE RACING WARS. 330-PLUS HORSEPOWER, EQUAL AMOUNT OF TORQUE. THIS THING IS GONNA BE EFFICIENT FOR THAT LIGHT-ASS TRUCK. PRETTY TOUGH-ASS MOTOR. IT'S GOT THE AFTER-MARKET BLOCK. IT SHOULD BE GREAT FOR, IF HE EVER DECIDED TO WANT TO DO POWER ADDERS, TURBOS, SUPERCHARGER. IT'LL HANDLE ALL OF IT. WHAT I'M PUTTING ON NOW IS JUST THE VINAJERA FRONT RUNNER SETUP, BUILD ALUMINUM COMPACT, JUST TRYING TO GIVE IT A MODERN FLAVOR WITH A SERPENTINE SETUP. THIS THING IS STARTING TO COME TOGETHER. IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, LOOKS AWESOME. I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS THING ALL DONE. SO, LENNY'S MUSTANG IS FINALLY DONE, SO I'M GONNA MEET LENNY AT THE TRACK WITH THE MUSTANG 'CAUSE THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO TEST OUT A NEW NITROUS SYSTEM. SO, A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU BROUGHT THE ELEANOR INTO US. YOU HAD A COUPLE REQUESTS. I KNOW YOU DRIVE THE CAR EVERY DAY. ONE THING YOU WANTED WAS A LOUDER STEREO, BUT YOU ALSO WANTED IT TO GO FASTER. SO... WE'VE GIVEN YOU BOTH TODAY. YEAH. INCREDIBLE. MY HEART'S POUNDING. THIS CAR WAS A LOT OF FUN TO DO FOR US. SO, WE'VE CREATED A NEW SPACE BACK HERE. WE'VE GOT FOUR COMPONENT SPEAKERS. THEY'RE ALL SIX INCHES. IN THE BACK, WE'VE GOT A 10-INCH SUB. IT SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CRUISE DOWN THE HIGHWAY, GOOD TUNES GOING THE WHOLE WAY. YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME. IN TERMS OF THE SPEED THING, BEHOLD, YOUR NITROUS BOX. LOOKS GREAT, VERY CLEAN. WHEN YOU WANT SOME EXTRA POWER CRUISING DOWN THE ROAD, FLOOR IT, HIT THE NITROUS, YOU GET THE EXTRA BOOST, SO... FANTASTIC. ON THE INTERIOR, YOU'VE GOT A SWITCH RIGHT HERE. SO TURN THAT ON, AND THEN RIGHT HERE, WE'VE GOT THE NITROUS. WOW. I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FUN WITH THAT. I'LL SHOW YOU -- LET'S TAKE A LOOK UNDER THE HOOK REAL QUICK. SO, YOU CAN SEE IF YOU LOOK BETWEEN YOUR INTAKE AND THE CARB HERE, YOU'VE GOT THE NITROUS LINE THAT COMES IN AND THE SOLENOID. PRETTY SIMPLE SETUP, VERY, VERY CLEAN. IT LOOKS GREAT. VERY EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THIS THING CAN DO. ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'VE GOT THIS WHOLE DRAG STRIP. WHY DON'T WE GO TEST IT OUT? - PERFECT. - ALL RIGHT. THIS WAS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE, AND SO THRILLED WITH THE CAR. HERE GOES NOTHING, RIGHT? YEAH, LET'S DO A TEST RUN, AND THEN WE'LL HIT THE NITROUS ON THE NEXT ONE. - PERFECT. - SEE WHAT THIS THING'S MADE OF. - NICE. - FEELS STRONG. - SOUNDS GREAT. - WOW. THERE YOU GO. THING MOVES NOW. MUCH, MUCH CLEANER. LET'S SEE WHAT IT CAN DO WITH THE NITROUS NOW. YEAH. LIFTING UP THAT HOOD OF THE TRUNK AND THEN SEEING THAT NITROUS BOTTLE, JUST GOT MY HEART RACING, AND JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OUT ON THE TRACK WITH IT. ALL RIGHT. TIME TO TRY THIS NITROUS SYSTEM OUT. GIVE IT HELL. - ALL RIGHT. WHOA! - HOLY COW! HOLY WHOA. WOW. MUCH BETTER RUN. YOU JUST DID A BURNOUT LIKE A MILE LONG. MAN, A BIG MOTOR LIKE THAT. WHOO! HITTING THAT NITROUS WAS JUST THROWING YOU BACK IN THE SEAT, AND THE HEART POUNDING, ADRENALINE FLOWING. IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THIS CAR. NOW IT PURRS LIKE A KITTEN. AND THEN WITH THE ADDITION OF THE NITROUS, IT ROARS LIKE A LION. YEAH, MAN. THANK YOU. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME. - PUT IT DOWN SLOW. - SLOW, MAN. I DON'T WANT TO CRUSH THE FLOOR. AFTER A MONTH OF BODYWORK, THIS '53 FORD IS FINALLY READY FOR PAINT. OKAY, SO WE'RE READY TO START SPRAYING BASE COAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA START WITH THE GREEN. WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA START WITH BLACK, AND THAT ALLOWS THE GREEN TO COVER A LITTLE BETTER, AND IT'S GONNA MAKE THE COLOR A LITTLE DEEPER THAN IT NORMALLY WOULD BE. SO IT'S ONLY GONNA REQUIRE MAYBE THREE COATS OF GREEN VERSUS PROBABLY DOUBLE THAT IF WE DIDN'T PUT DOWN THE BLACK. WE GOT OUR BLACK LAID DOWN. IT LAID DOWN REALLY NICE. IT'S A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR OUR GREEN. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND PUT THREE COATS OF GREEN DOWN, AND THEN WE'LL BE READY FOR THE CLEAR COAT. THE PAINT IS DRY ON ROB'S FORD F-100, SO IT'S TIME TO ASSEMBLE ALL THE PIECES AND GET THIS THING LOOKING LIKE A TRUCK AGAIN. WELL, WE GOT THE CHASSIS OVER HERE FOR THE '53 FORD, READY TO SET THE CAB ON THERE. IT'S A BIG DAY. A LOT OF WORK WENT INTO THIS, KIND OF LIKE SENDING A KID OFF TO SCHOOL, MAN. THAT WENT PRETTY WELL. SO, WE'VE GOT THE CAB ON THE CHASSIS, NOW IT'S TIME TO SHIFT TO THE INTERIOR, MAKE THAT LOOK LIKE A TRUCK, TOO. TAKE THE BUMPERS OFF AND SHAVE THE BUMPERS. SO NOW WHAT WE HAVE BASICALLY IS LIKE A FRONT VALANCE WITH A BIG, OPEN MOUTH, LIKE AN AIR SCOOP. AND TO KEEP THE BIRDS AND RACCOONS OUT, WE'RE PUTTING, LIKE, A SPEED MESH BACK IN THERE. HIT THE ROAD KILL AND GETS TRAPPED IN THERE, MARK CAN JUST PEEL IT OUT AND THROW IT IN THE LUNCH BOX. WELL, WE'RE GETTING READY TO TEST-FIRE OUR BOSS 302 IN OUR PROJECT HERE. IT'S GOT THE GT40 HEADS. IT'S GOT AN ALL FORGE BOTTOM END. IT'S 9-TO-1 COMPRESSION. IT MAKES ABOUT 345 HORSEPOWER. IT'S REALLY GONNA BE A LOT OF FUN TO DRIVE. ALL RIGHT, ERIC. HIT IT. SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SO, WE BUILT THIS TRUCK FROM THE GROUND UP, AND ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE IN THE SHOP HAS A HAND IN MAKING IT EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS NOW. SO TO HEAR IT START FOR THE FIRST TIME MAKES ME PROUD, AND I KNOW ROB'S GONNA LOVE IT. LET'S GET THE REST OF THE BODY PANELS ON THE CAR, LET'S GET THE GLASS IN. I'LL HAVE BRYAN GET ON THE INTERIOR. LET'S TAKE THIS SUCKER FOR A TEST DRIVE. ALL RIGHT, WE GOT THE '53 FORD HERE. WE'RE GETTING THE BED BACK TOGETHER. STILL GOT THE FRONT END TO DO, BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. WHOA. DON'T DRILL THROUGH YOUR HAND. YEAH. I'M LINING UP WITH THE HOLE RIGHT HERE. WOOD DELIVERY, HUH? - WOOD DELIVERY. LET'S MOCK IT UP AND SEE HOW IT LOOKS. ALL RIGHT. THE CLIENT ON THIS WANTED A WOOD BED FLOOR IN IT, SO WE DECIDED TO GO WITH AN OAK. WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA DO A DARK STAIN WITH A MATTE FINISH. RIGHT. FOR THE METAL STRIPS IN THE BED OF THE F-100, I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND PAINT 'EM GREEN, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO CHECK WITH THE CUSTOMER FIRST. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET THE BOARDS READY. ALL RIGHT, BOTTOM OF THE BOARDS. WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ULTRA FANCY. IT'S JUST REGULAR OUTDOOR LATEX WOOD PAINT. IT LOOKS BLUE. HOPEFULLY IT DRIES BLACK BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BLACK. - DANIEL-SAN. - WHAT'S UP? PAINT THE FENCE. I'M PAINTING THE FENCE. I'M PAINTING THE FENCE BLUE. BLACK. THIS IS THE CAN YOU GAVE ME. IT'S BLUE. - IT DRIES BLACK. IT BETTER DRY BLACK. WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT, WE'LL WAX THE CAR, OKAY? I DON'T WAX CARS. YOU BETTER TALK TO RALPH ABOUT THAT. WAX ON, WAX OFF. WAX ON, WAX OFF. SO, TOMORROW'S THE BIG DAY FOR ROB BECAUSE HE FINALLY GETS TO DRIVE HIS TRUCK, SO I JUST NEED BRYAN TO PUT SOME FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE INTERIOR AND GET THIS BABY OUT THE DOOR. AS SOON AS WE FINISH UP THE DOOR SILLS, STEERING WHEEL AND SHIFT BOOT, WE'LL DRIVE THIS ONE DOWN THE ROAD. I THINK THIS ONE WOULD LOOK REALLY GOOD IN MY GARAGE. I WAS THINKING, WHAT BETTER PLACE TO SHOW YOU ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC FARM TRUCKS OF ALL TIME THAN AN ACTUAL FARM? SO, THE PICKUP TRUCK IS FINALLY DONE. WE GOT SOME ROADS CLOSED DOWN OUT IN THE COUNTRY, AND I'M GONNA LET ROB HAVE AT IT. YOU KNOW, MY DAD AND MY AUNT BOTH GREW UP ON A FARM, AND I GOT A NAME FOR THE TRUCK, ACTUALLY. I BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT SINCE I DROPPED THE TRUCK OFF. YES? I'M GONNA NAME IT AFTER MY AUNT WHO PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR. HER NAME WAS -- - I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THAT. HER NAME WAS BETTY. WELL, DON'T BE SORRY. SHE WAS WILD, AND I HOPE THIS TRUCK IS WILD, TOO. I THINK WE BUILT THE RIGHT TRUCK FOR YOU, THEN. SO THE PERFECT NAME -- BETTY. BUT I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION. - WHAT IS IT? I SEE THE HOUSE. I SEE THE BARN. I DON'T SEE MY TRUCK. WHERE'S THE TRUCK? - COME ON, FOLLOW ME. - LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. WELL, I BROUGHT YOU HERE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THERE YOU GO. NO, I'M SORRY, THIS IS NOT MY TRUCK. YOU BROUGHT ME A RUSTY HUNK. IT WAS NOT PRETTY. - THAT IS FANTASTIC. AND OF THAT RUSTY HUNK, WE WERE ABLE TO SALVAGE THE CAB. UNBELIEVABLE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY MUCH NEW. - THAT'S THE ORIGINAL CAB. - WE KEPT THE CAB. THAT CANNOT BE THE ORIGINAL CAB. THAT IS ACTUALLY THE ORIGINAL CAB. THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN I WALKED UP IS THAT BEAUTIFUL GREEN. I LOVE THAT GREEN COLOR, AND THEY NAILED IT. THE SECOND THING I NOTICED WAS THAT BEAUTIFUL BRONZE ON THOSE WHEELS. THEY JUST ABSOLUTELY KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK. TELL ME ABOUT THOSE TIRES. YOU PUT SOME MEAT ON THIS THING. YEAH, SO WE'VE GOT 20-INCH WHEELS ALL THE WAY AROUND WITH HUGE TIRES IN THE BACK. WE HAVE A 12-INCH-WIDE WHEEL, SO YOU GET A BIG, FAT STANCE. GOING OFF OF THAT, WE HAVE A CHASSIS UNDER THIS THAT'S ACTUALLY DESIGNED FOR AUTOCROSS. WE'VE GOT A FOUR-LINK REAR END. WE'VE GOT A KILLER FORD 9-INCH BACK THERE AND HUGE BRAKES. THIS THING STOPS ON A DIME. THE FREAKIN' HANDLING, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT. WALKING AROUND, THERE'S LOTS OF GOOD BODY MODIFICATIONS. - OH, MY GOSH. - NO MORE BUMPER. WHERE'S THE BUMPER? YOU TOLD ME TO GET RID OF THE BUMPER, THE BUMPER'S GONE. HOME RUN, MAN. THAT'S AWESOME. - WE GOT NO MORE BUMPER. - THAT LOOKS MEAN. THAT IS AWESOME. - IT LOOKS GOOD. CLASSIC GRILLE. - MAN, OH, MAN. AMAZING-LOOKING GRILLE, BUT WHOLE FRONT END'S CLEANED UP. GOT THIS MEAN SCOOP IN THE MIDDLE, LITTLE MESH BEHIND. LET'S CHECK OUT THE INTERIOR. YOU GOTTA CHECK IT OUT, SO... OH, MY GOD. IT IS SUPER, SUPER SLICK AND CLEAN. HIGH-END RELICATE LEATHER ALL THE WAY THROUGH. - YOU KNOW WHAT? - TELL ME. MAMA'S GONNA LET ME TAKE HER TO THE DANCE IN THIS THING NOW. YOU THINK SO, WITH CHICKENS IN THE BACK? SHE WOULDN'T LET ME -- SHE WOULDN'T GET IN THE OTHER CAR. - OH, BOY. - SHE MIGHT GET IN THIS ONE. I THINK SHE'LL RIDE. SO, YOU'VE GOT ALL THE MODERN CONVENIENCES. CUSTOM DOOR PANELS. - THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. - THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. SCOTT HANDMADE THESE, SO THAT'S ALL ONE-OFF STUFF THERE. AND BRYAN KILLED IT ON THE INTERIOR. YOU WANTED YOUR DIAMOND STITCHING, YOU GOT YOUR DIAMOND STITCHING. THE STITCHING IS AWESOME. WE'VE GOT THE DASH COMPLETELY CLEANED UP. IT IS BODY WORKED TO THE NINES. SUPER SLICK, ALL THE PAINT'S BEEN WET SANDED. SO, SAME ENGINE UNDER THE HOOD? - YOU KNOW... - I DON'T THINK SO. SHOW ME WHAT'S UNDERNEATH HERE. SO, WE'VE GOT A BRAND-NEW FORD RACING BOSS MOTOR. - OH, MY GOSH. - 302 SMALL BLOCK. THINKING ABOUT 400 HORSEPOWER, AND ONE OF THE CLEANEST, SANITARY ENGINE COMPARTMENTS YOU'RE EVER GONNA FIND. BEAUTIFUL. IT IS A PIECE OF ROLLING ART, SO... - BEAUTIFUL. - YOU POP THE HOOD, AND IT'S NOT GONNA DISAPPOINT ANYWHERE YOU GO. THAT'S A NEW TRUCK, BUT STILL CLASSIC LOOK. I LOVE THAT. YEAH, YOU KNOW, THESE THINGS AGE REALLY WELL. I THINK WE'VE CLEANED UP ENOUGH STUFF TO KIND OF PAY HOMAGE TO THAT ORIGINAL DESIGN. YOU STILL KNOW IT'S A '53. IT'S JUST COMING DOWN THE ROAD A LITTLE FASTER. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'D YOU DO TO THE BACK OF THIS THING? THAT BED IS BEAUTIFUL. SO, WE'VE GOT SOME NICE BRUSHED SLATS RIGHT HERE. WE'VE INTEGRATED THE FUEL RIGHT HERE, SO WE'VE GOT IT ALL WELDED IN AND SMOOTHED OUT. IT LOOKS REALLY, REALLY SLICK. SO, COMING AROUND TO THE BACK. YOU KEPT THE ONE THING I TOLD YOU TO KEEP, AND YOU DID, AND YOU MADE IT LOOK BEAUTIFUL. THAT TAILGATE. YOU GUYS HAVE KILLED THIS THING. - HEY. - IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THANK YOU. I KNOW IT LOOKS COOL, AND HOPE WE GOT EVERYTHING CHECKED OFF THERE, BUT FOR ME, THE BEST PART IS ACTUALLY DRIVING THIS THING. SO... - CAN WE TAKE IT? - WE CAN. - WHERE WE GOING? WELL, I WAS ABLE TO PULL A COUPLE STRINGS. I GOT A BIG STRETCH OF ROAD CLOSED DOWN. WE CAN JUST DRIVE THE WHEELS OFF. - AWESOME. - YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. LET'S GO. LET'S GET IT GOING. WHOO-HOO! WE'RE ON A CURVY ROAD, AND THIS THING STRAIGHT HANDLES. THE EXHAUST IS GREAT. DUSTIN MADE A CUSTOM SEAMLESS EXHAUST FOR IT. - YEAH. - THIS IS 90. IT HANDLES LIKE A NEW MUSTANG. IT'S NUTS. YOU'RE DRIVING IT FASTER THAN I'VE DRIVEN IT, SO GOOD FOR YOU. HOW MUCH HORSEPOWER DO YOU THINK THIS THING'S PUTTING OUT? - 450. - 450? YEAH. OH, MAN, THIS IS FUN. THIS IS EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, PLUS SOME. - GOOD. - AWESOME TRUCK. THIS THING IS DRIVING LIKE A RACECAR. CLASSIC CAR STUDIO MET MY EXPECTATIONS. THEY DID AN AWESOME JOB ACROSS THE BOARD.
