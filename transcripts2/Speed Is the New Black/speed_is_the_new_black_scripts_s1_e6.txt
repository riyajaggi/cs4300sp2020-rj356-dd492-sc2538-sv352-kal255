 WELL, THANKS FOR COMING IN TODAY, JEFF. THIS IS A REALLY COOL CAR. - OH, THIS IS EXCITING. SO I KNOW JEFF'S BEEN IN THE MARKET FOR A CHEVELLE FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT I FOUND FOR HIM IS A REALLY, REALLY NICE 1969 CHEVELLE. IT'S HAD ALL THE BODY WORK DONE ALREADY, WHICH I LIKE BECAUSE WE CAN MAKE A BUNCH OF CUSTOM TOUCHES AND REALLY FOCUS OUR ENERGY ON THE PERFORMANCE. THIS IS A PROJECT THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND BY ANOTHER CUSTOMER, AND THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE FOR US TO KIND OF START ON A NEW DEAL. I THINK CHEVELLES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRONG TO ME. IT REPRESENTS MAYBE WHAT CHEVROLET WAS DOING BACK IN THE '60S. "SEE THE USA IN A CHEVROLET." AND THERE'S JUST SOMETHING TO IT. IT GIVES YOU A FREEDOM TO GET AWAY FROM ALL THE DAILY ELECTRONIC STUFF AND ALL THAT BECAUSE, PROBABLY, WITH A CAR LIKE THIS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR YOUR CELL PHONE RING ANYWAY. - WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT? - IT LOOKS GOOD. NO, I'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN MAYBE LOWERING THE CAR TO THE GROUND TO GIVE IT A... I WAS THINKING THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT REAL PRONE TO DO RACETRACK STUFF. RIGHT. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. OKAY. THIS IS THE THIRD CAR I'VE DONE FOR JEFF, SO BY NOW I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF, YOU KNOW, WHERE HE WANTS TO GO AND WHAT HE REALLY WANTS OUT OF THE CAR. LET'S CHECK OUT THE INTERIOR. SINCE I'M 6-FOOT-4, HOW'S THE SEATING GOING TO GO UP AGAINST THE STEERING WHEEL? WE DON'T HAVE SEATING YET, WHICH IS GOOD. SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET A SEAT IN, FIT YOU IN THE CAR AND MAKE SURE IT'S GOOD TO GO BEFORE WE DO ANY FINAL TOUCHES OR FINISH THE SEAT. OKAY. YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT? YEAH. SO FAST AND QUICK IS WHERE WE'RE HEADED HERE. YEAH, SO, AT THE MOMENT, WE JUST HAVE A MOTOR THAT'S SITTING HERE. SO, IN YOUR OTHER CAR, IT HAD ABOUT 500 HORSEPOWER. WHAT DO YOU THINK ON THIS ONE? IT'S LOOKING PRETTY MAJOR. I'M THINKING ABOUT DRIVING IT ON THE STREET A LOT AND MAYBE OCCASIONALLY GOING REAL FAST. TALKING ABOUT A TICKET MACHINE RIDE. A TICKET MACHINE. ARE YOU PRONE TO TICKETS? NO, NO. KNOCK ON WOOD. YOU GOT ALL YOUR EXCUSES READY? I'M A SAFE DRIVER. IT'S GOING TO BE AN ELEVATED STATE OF AWARENESS AND SENSORY EXPLOSION, WHETHER IT'S THE NOISE, THE SMELL, THE SPEED. AND IT'S NOT ABOUT SHOWING OFF, PER SE. I THINK IT'S ABOUT SHOWING THAT YOU'VE TREATED THIS CAR WITH RESPECT AND WHAT IT DESERVES TO BE DOING. WHAT'S THE MILES PER GALLON, AS YOUR BEST GUESS? FIVE? SIX? JEFF WANTS POWER AND PERFORMANCE. I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW MUCH HE'S GOING TO USE IT, THIS CAR'S GOING TO BLOW PEOPLE AWAY AT CAR SHOWS. I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR THE BIG TROPHIES. YOU WANT TO DO A CAR SHOW? WE MIGHT AS WELL. I CAN SIT THERE ALL DAY LIKE THE REST OF THE OLD GUYS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD. LATEST PROJECT -- 1969 CHEVELLE. MAN! STYLISTICALLY, PROBABLY NOT WHAT WE WANT. LUCKILY... - NO! ...IT'S NOT WHAT JEFF WANTS EITHER. STRAIGHT OUT OF 1980. WE GOT TIGHT JEAN SHORTS AND MULLETS ON RIGHT NOW. HE'S NOT A TIGHT JEAN SHORT AND MULLET TYPE OF GUY. I LIKE CHEVELLES BECAUSE THEY'RE A CLASSIC CHEVY MUSCLE CAR. THEY'RE COOL CARS TO BUILD BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. BIG, HUGE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. YOU CAN FIT A HUGE MOTOR IN THERE. CHEVELLE IS A BAD-ASS CAR TO WORK WITH. JEFF WANTS SOMETHING THAT'S STUPID FAST THAT HE CAN ALSO TAKE TO CAR SHOWS. IT'S ALSO GOT TO BE COMFORTABLE. HE'S 6-5, BIG GUY. LUCKILY, THE CAR'S GOT A LOT OF SPACE IN IT, COMPLETELY BARE INTERIOR. SO WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD THIS THING AROUND HIM, MAKE IT EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING FOR OUTSIDE STYLING? IT NEEDS MODERN WHEELS. - MODERN WHEELS. - THOSE WHEELS HAVE TO GO. ABSOLUTELY. I THINK WITH THE PRO TOURING STYLE SUSPENSION, WE CAN DROP IT WAY DOWN ON THE GROUND. AND A BIG MODERN WHEEL, 20 X 12 IN THE BACK. IT'LL TUCK UP IN THERE NICELY, AND IT'LL LOOK FREAKING PISSED-OFF. THE CAR WAS SET UP AS A PRO STREET CAR, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A PRO TOURING CAR. SO A LOT OF THAT STUFF HAS GOT TO GO, AND IN ITS PLACE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME AWESOME NEW PARTS. SLICK BLACK. GOING BLACK? BLACK'S FINE WITH ME. I'M NOT DIGGING THE STRIPES. THAT'S THE ONE THING. IF WE'RE GOING TO SLAM IT ON THE GROUND, DO MODERN WHEELS, I THINK WE KIND OF GOT TO MODERNIZE UP THE PAINT JOB A LITTLE BIT. SO YOU WANT TO LOSE THE STRIPES COMPLETELY AND LEAVE IT ALL BLACK? WE COULD DO, LIKE, A MATTE-STYLE STRIPE? TOTALLY DIFFERENT STYLE STRIPE. AND THEN WE COULD BRING IN SOME KIND OF CONTRAST AND A COLOR THERE. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, IF WE GO CRAZY IN THE INTERIOR WITH A BIG, BRIGHT COLOR? - PURPLE? - NO. - RED. - I'M THINKING RED. RED. OH, OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A MEAN MACHINE. IT'S GOING TO HAVE CRAZY HORSEPOWER. SPEAKING OF THAT, LET'S LOOK AT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. - MAN! - SUPER CLEAN AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT MUCH IN HERE. IT'S A SMALL BLOCK 408 STROKER, BIG PROCHARGER, AND IT'S GOOD FOR 1,200 HORSEPOWER. IT SHOULD BE PRETTY WILD. I SEE A LOT OF NAKED SPACE THERE. YEAH. ONCE WE PUT A BLOWER IN HERE, A LOT OF THAT SPACE IS GOING TO GET TAKEN UP. SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO DO SOME REALLY NICE, CLEAN, CUSTOM TIG-WELDED PIPING. YOU DOING THEM PROCHARGERS AND ALL THAT, MAN, IT GETS SO FULL OF TUBING. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU REAR-ENDED A PLUMBER'S TRUCK AND THAT ALL WENT UNDER YOUR HOOD. - SO. - RIGHT. IF WE COULD DO SOME PLUMBING THAT WOULD BE SUPER CLEAN AND HIDDEN, WHAT IF WE RAN SOMETHING LIKE BACKWARDS AND BEHIND SOME INNER FENDERS THAT WE MADE AND RUN THE TUBING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AS MUCH AS WE COULD? SOUNDS GOOD. ONE THING I THINK WILL LOOK GOOD IS PAINT THE ENGINE RED, TOO. AND WE'LL HAVE AN ALL-BLACK ENGINE COMPARTMENT WITH THE RED MOTOR, BRING SOME OF THAT, AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MATCH THAT PAINT COLOR TO OUR LEATHER PRETTY EASILY. BUILDS LIKE THIS ARE REALLY COOL BECAUSE WE'RE PUSHING THE QUALITY AS FAR AS IT CAN POSSIBLY GO, AND WE'RE GIVING IT THE PERFORMANCE OF A RACE CAR. SO BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. - I LIKE IT. - I THINK SO, TOO. IT'S GOING TO HAVE A MEAN LOOK TO IT. IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM. - RIGHT. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. SO WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE WITH THIS CAR? TAKE APART THIS ENGINE. WANTS TO GO A WHOLE DIFFERENT ROUTE WITH IT. WANTS TO GO PRO TOURING WITH IT. SO WE'RE TAKING THIS CHEVELLE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. SO I NEED MY GUYS TO STRIP IT DOWN, ENGINE, ROLL CAGE, SUSPENSION, BRAKES, WHEELS, ALL THAT STUFF'S GOT TO GO. TAKE IT UP SLOW. JUST PUT A LITTLE TENSION ON IT. - THERE, WE GOT IT. - YOU'RE GOOD. - IT'S CLEAR. - PULL ON BACK. PLAN OF ATTACK NOW IS TO GET THE WHEELS OFF. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET HER UP IN THE AIR. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS GETTING RID OF THESE FACTORY BRAKES. WE'RE GOING TO PUT BIG 14-INCH ROTORS ON IT WITH SIX PISTONS, THAT WAY IT HAS MORE STOPPING POWER AND BE ABLE TO HANDLE THOSE TRACK CONDITIONS HE'S CHANGING TO STYLE NOW. MAN, IT'S GOT A CELL IN IT. - YEAH. - LET'S GET THAT THING OUT. THAT THING'S GOT TO BE LIKE 30 GALLONS, MAN. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ALL PREPPED UP. WE'RE READY TO GO, GOT EVERYTHING TAPED OFF. CUTTING BASICALLY THE FRONT HALF OF THIS ROLL BAR OUT TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM FOR OUR CLIENT. GOING TO GET RID OF THIS. LET HIM, YOU KNOW, HAVE SOME FOOT ROOM IN HERE AND PROBABLY DO SOME COOL KICK PANEL SPEAKERS MAYBE. SEE IF WE CAN GET THIS THING OUT IN ONE PIECE. I'M SURE THERE'S A LITTLE NOTE IN THERE. OH, YEAH? OH, YEAH. YOU CAN SEE HERE SOMEBODY LEFT US A LITTLE TIME CAPSULE. NO WAY. YEAH, WAY. THIS IS GOING TO BE CUTE. "TO WHOEVER MADE THE TERRIBLE DECISION TO CUT OUT THIS ROLL CAGE -- YOU WILL REGRET THIS. THIS CHEVELLE NEEDS TO GO FAST. YOU'RE TURNING THIS CHEVELLE INTO A GROCERY-GETTER. MAY A TERRIBLE CURSE BE PLACED UPON YOU. MAY THE PRODUCE YOU BUY FOREVER BE ROTTEN. SINCERELY, THE CHEVELLE DEMON GUARDIAN." CUTE. THIS IS THE LAST ROLL CAGE I CUT OUT. LET'S CUT IT UP INTO MORE PIECES. I'M NOT KIDDING YOU. I JUST FOUND THAT IN THERE. I JUST HAPPENED TO LOOK AT IT TO SEE WHAT THE ID/OD OF THE TUBE WAS. THAT'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD. I LIKE IT. - IT'S AWESOME. SO IS THE CAR CURSED OR WHAT? - NOW. - YEAH. ACCORDING TO THIS. WE'RE JUST GOING TO LIGHT IT ON FIRE. THAT'S HOW YOU KILL CURSES, RIGHT? THE CHEVELLE HAD SOME DISC BRAKES ON IT, BUT IT WASN'T THE HOTTEST SETUP. WITH THE AMOUNT OF POWER WE'RE GIVING THIS THING, WE NEED BIG STOPPING POWER TO GO ALONG WITH IT. SO WHAT I'M DOING HERE NOW IS SAFETY WIRING, ATTACHING BOLTS FROM THE ROTOR TO THE MAIN HAT ON THE BRAKES JUST AS AN EXTRA SAFETY PRECAUTION. IT'S BASICALLY JUST TO KEEP BOLTS FROM LOOSENING UP AND FALLING OUT. SO THE IDEA IS IF ONE BOLT STARTS TO LOOSEN, IT ACTUALLY TIGHTENS THE OTHER BOLT AND THEN PUTS THIS BOLT NEUTRAL. DEFINITELY A TEDIOUS PROCESS. WE'VE GOT 14-INCH ROTORS UP FRONT WITH SIX-PISTON CALIPERS AND 13-INCH ROTORS IN THE BACK WITH FOUR-PISTON CALIPERS. IT'S GOING TO STOP ON A DIME AND LEAVE SOME CHANGE LEFT OVER. NOW THE JEWELRY. NOW THAT'S BRAKES. JEFF WANTS POWER AND PERFORMANCE, SO I DECIDED TO GO WITH A DART BLOCK, WHICH IS GOING TO BE A 408 STROKER. IT'S ALL FOURS INTERNAL, SO IT'S GOING TO HOLD TOGETHER UNDER HIGH BOOST AND HIGH HORSEPOWER. IT'S GOT PORT AND POLISHED HEADS. IT HAS A REALLY, REALLY NICE MODERN FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM. AND WITH THAT F-1 SUPERCHARGER ON IT, IT'S GOING TO FREAKING SCREAM ITS ASS OFF AND PROBABLY SCARE SOME PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF. LET'S GO BACK. TIGHTEN IT UP. - OKAY. - YEP. LET'S SEE WHERE I'M AT OVER HERE. OH, YEAH. YOU GOOD ON YOUR SIDE? - YEAH, IT LOOKS GOOD. - COOL, MAN. WE IN THERE LIKE SWIMWEAR. GOT IT. - GET IT? - YEP. AW, THIS IS A BAD MOFO HERE. THIS SHOULD BE UNREAL. I USUALLY DON'T LIKE TO GET ON IT AND DRIVE PEOPLE'S CARS HARD, BUT THIS ONE WILL BE A MONSTER. YOU GOT THOSE TUBES? YEAH. YEAH, I GOT THEM OVER HERE. SO WE'RE ADDING AN F-1 PROCHARGER AND AN INTERCOOLER TO THE CHEVELLE TO GIVE IT AS MUCH HORSEPOWER AS POSSIBLE. BUT I WANT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT TO LOOK REALLY CLEAN AND TIDY, SO I NEED THE GUYS TO WORK ON A PIPING SETUP THAT'S GOING TO LOOK NICE AND CLEAN. YOU MADE THOSE FOR A NOVA? YEAH. HOLY, LOOK HOW BIG THOSE THINGS ARE! MAN! YOU DON'T LIKE THEM? THEY'RE AWFUL LARGE. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW. I LIKE THEM, DUDE. I THINK THEY'RE FINE. - WHAT? - YOU GUYS JUST MOCKING IT UP? OR, I MEAN, WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE? YEAH, IT'S MOCKING UP. I DON'T WANT TO HURT NO FEELINGS, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID IN THE DESIGN MEETING. IT LOOKS LIKE WE REAR-ENDED A PLUMBING TRUCK, AND ALL THE PLUMBING WENT UNDER THE HOOD. WHEN WE POP THE HOOD, WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A PLUMBING STORE. WE WANT TO SEE A BAD-ASS MOTOR. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FAB SOME INNER FENDERS AND TRY TO HIDE AS MUCH OF THAT AS WE CAN. IT'S DONE THOUGH, DUDE. IT LOOKS GOOD. IT'S ALL POLISHED UP AND SCOTCH-BRITED, AND IT'S FINISHED, LIKE... I MEAN, IT'S RACE-CAR COOL, BUT THIS THING'S GOING TO BE, LIKE, JUST MORE THAN RACE CAR. SHOW CAR. YEAH. IT MAY HAVE SOME GO, BUT IT AIN'T GOT NO FLOW. - RIGHT ON. - OH, MAN! WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THESE? I'D JUST PULL THEM ALL OFF AND... HERE, I'LL JUST GET RID OF IT. AW. OH, DUDE! WE DON'T NEED THOSE PIECES OF. - WHAT? - GET THAT ONE OUT OF HERE. YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE MY AND THROW... OH, THAT'S HOW IT IS. - NOW. NOW WE GOT A CLEAN. YEAH, NOW WE GOT A CLEAN SLATE. COME ON, MAN. I DON'T WANT TO CRUSH YOUR LITTLE HEART. THAT WAS MY HARD WORK. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALL RIGHT, GUYS. GIVE HIM A LITTLE LOVE. - GO BACK TO YOUR HOLE. - YEAH, GET OUT OF HERE! DO WE HAVE SOME INNER FENDER WELLS FOR THIS? NO, NOT YET. WE DON'T. LIKE I SAID, HE'S GOING TO FAB THEM UP. WELL, I WAS THINKING WE'D KEEP THE TUBES TO WHERE WE COULD STILL SEE THEM. COULD YOU BRING THIS ONE DOWN HERE, YOU COULD WRAP IT THERE TO THE FENDER WELL. WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING? ARE YOU WATCHING WHERE YOU'RE GOING? I WAS JUST BRINGING YOUR PIPES BACK. AW, THANKS, DUDE! THAT AIN'T RIGHT. I WAS GOING TO USE SOME OF THOSE BENDS FOR THESE NEW ONES. I HONESTLY DIDN'T SEE THEM THERE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOCK THIS UP. SINCE SCOTT DECIDED IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO RUN OVER THE PROCHARGER PIPES FOR THE CHEVELLE, NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BETTER, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE COOLER. SO MAYBE HE DID ME A FAVOR. THEN WE CAN SINK THE INTERCOOLER... INTERCOOLER INSIDE RIGHT HERE. I'M GOING TO USE THIS SPACE TO HIDE THAT INTERCOOLER A LITTLE MORE. SO BASICALLY, ALL THIS STUFF, WE'RE GOING TO CUT IT OUT, GET RID OF IT AND MAKE SOME MORE ROOM. THE NEXT THING WE'VE GOT TO DO ON THE CHEVELLE IS PROBABLY SOME CUSTOM-FABRICATED HEADERS. NOBODY MAKES A PRIMARY TUBE MID-LENGTH HEADER THAT WILL SUPPORT THE KIND OF POWER THAT WE NEED TO PUT THROUGH THIS THING. SO BEING THAT WE'RE HAMMERING THE CAR ON THE GROUND, WE NEED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING PRETTY WICKED AND CUSTOM. MY APPROACH TO DOING CUSTOM-MADE HEADERS IS I LIKE TO TAKE ALL THESE PIECES AND CHOP THEM UP AND JUST KIND OF BUILD IT IN MY HEAD AND START PLAYING WITH STUFF. AND, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA IS TO HAVE A COMPLETE ONE-OFF HANDMADE PART WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED, SOMETHING THAT'S UNIQUE AND LOOKS KILLER, LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING FAST SITTING STILL, AND HAND-MADE, ONE OF A KIND. WHAT'S THIS THING, PAUL? YOU KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS. I BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT SINCE I WORK HERE. IS THIS THE NOTORIOUS 1937 WILLYS THAT'S BEEN GOING FOR 37 YEARS? 37 YEARS. THAT'S A LONG TIME FOR A PROJECT. THAT MIGHT BE A RECORD. MY DAD'S TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT CARS. AND HE'S HAD THIS '37 WILLYS SINCE I WAS 6 YEARS OLD. NOW I'M MARRIED, AND I'VE GOT A DAUGHTER THAT'S ALMOST THAT AGE. IT'S TIME TO GET IT DONE FOR HIM. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE A MIRACLE TO FINISH THIS CAR, BUT IF A MIRACLE CAN HAPPEN, IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IN THIS SHOP WHEN WE ALL TEAM UP AND FINISH IT FOR HIM. WELL, YOU KNOW HIM. DAD'S ALWAYS HELPED EVERYBODY ELSE, AND EVERY TIME HE GETS THE TOOLS OUT, HAS THE MONEY, GETS THE PARTS, STARTS WORKING ON THE CAR, HIS PHONE RINGS, OR SOMEBODY'S KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. WELL, NOW IS THE TIME TO GET THIS CAR DONE. DAD'S BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME. AND LET'S FACE IT, NONE OF US ARE GETTING ANY YOUNGER, ESPECIALLY HIM. HE NEEDS TO BE DRIVING THIS CAR, NOT WORKING ON IT. WELL, IT LOOKS PRETTY NICE. SO WHAT DOES IT NEED? FINAL MECHANICAL AND THE INTERIOR? YEAH, IT NEEDS WIRING. IT NEEDS THE EXHAUST DONE. AND WE NEED TO GET BRIAN TO DO SOME INTERIOR WORK. OUR SHOP IS TOTALLY SLAMMED RIGHT NOW. BUT PAUL'S DAD HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO A LOT OF GUYS. HE IS A HERO TO THEM. HE HAS HELPED OUT SO MANY OF THESE GUYS OVER SO MANY YEARS. SO WHAT'S ONE MORE CAR IN THE MIX? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, PAUL. YOU'VE HELPED ME OUT SO MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS, SO I'M WILLING TO STEP UP HERE AND GET THE GUYS ON THIS THING AND GET IT DONE. I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS CAR ON THE ROAD FOR YOUR DAD. IT'S A GOOD STORY, AND THIS IS A PRETTY BAD-ASS LOOKING CAR. - OH, YEAH! - LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN BEFORE HE'S IN SENIOR CARE. RIGHT. BUT ONE LAST THING. - YEAH? - THIS IS A SECRET. - ALL RIGHT. SHH! - AWESOME, NOAH. YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME. AWESOME. I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE THING FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. - AWESOME. I'M EXCITED. - THANKS, NOAH. SO I'VE JUST ROCKED OUT THE HEADER FABRICATION ON THE CHEVELLE. NOW I'VE GOT TO GET UNDERNEATH THE CAR AND DO A CUSTOM-MADE EXHAUST SYSTEM. GOT TO KEEP IT UP TIGHT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE CAR HAMMERED ON THE GROUND. NOW IT'S TIME TO TACK IT UP. DOUBLE CHECK AND BUTTON THIS THING UP. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE EX PIPE, AT LEAST ON A CHEVELLE, IS GOING TO BE WE'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER SOUND OUT OF IT, AND THEN WE GET A SCAVENGING EFFECT ALSO FROM BANK TO BANK BECAUSE OF THE CROSSOVER OF THE EX PIPE. BEING THAT WE'RE SHOVING BOOST THROUGH IT, IT'S GOING TO HELP IT ON THE OVERLAP WITH THE CAM AND REALLY PULL SOME HORSEPOWER OUT OF THE MOTOR. LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE HERE ON THE CHEVELLE. COOL. I THINK THAT WILL WORK. SO WE'RE GIVING THIS '69 CHEVELLE 1,200 HORSEPOWER. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO HAVE DUSTIN DO IS MODIFY THE INTERCOOLER SO THE TUBING IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT IS AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE AND THIS THING GETS THE BEST POSSIBLE FLOW AS WELL. I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS CHANGE IT FROM IN AND OUT ON THE SAME SIDE. - OKAY. I MAY MODIFY IT RIGHT HERE AND MAKE IT COME IN ON THIS SIDE OVER HERE. AIR FLOW IS REALLY IMPORTANT WITH FORCED INDUCTION. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO KEEP THIS LOOKING REALLY CLEAN AS WELL. SO DUSTIN'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET CREATIVE WITH THE TUBING. SO I JUST FINISHED CUTTING OUT THE TEMPLATES THAT WE MADE FOR THE INTERCOOLER. COSMETICALLY, I KIND OF WANT THE PROPORTIONS TO BE THE SAME WHEN YOU KIND OF SEE EVERYTHING THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE GRILLE. AS FAR AS PERFORMANCE GOES, ALSO I'VE ACTUALLY GAINED SOME PERFORMANCE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO BRING THE AIR INTO ONE SIDE AND THEN FORCE IT OUT THE OTHER SIDE. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE OF A FREE FLOW THROUGH THE CORE OF THE INTERCOOLER, WHICH IS A LOT BETTER FOR FLOW. FINALLY GOT THIS THING DONE, AND I THINK IT LOOKS PRETTY KICK-ASS. I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THE WAY THAT IT TURNED OUT. GET IT BACK ON, DO ONE MORE MOUNT AND START MAKING SOME TUBING. WELL, I'M HERE ON A SATURDAY TRYING TO USE ANY EXTRA TIME I HAVE, IF THERE IS ANY, TO GET DAD'S CAR DONE FOR HIM. IT'S HAD FOUR DIFFERENT ENGINES IN IT, FOUR DIFFERENT TRANSMISSIONS, TWO DIFFERENT REAR ENDS, AND NOW WE'VE GOT AN LS ENGINE IN IT AND A 4L60E BEHIND IT. TODAY, I'M BUILDING A CUSTOM EXHAUST FOR THE WILLYS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A KIT AVAILABLE FOR IT. IT IS A 1937 WILLYS, AND I WANT IT TO BE OVER THE TOP FOR DAD ANYWAY, SO I'M DOING A CUSTOM ONE-OFF EXHAUST FOR HIM. IT'S ALL GOING TO BE OUT OF FOOD-GRADE, BAD-ASS STAINLESS, ALL TIG-WELDED. HE'S JUST GOING TO FREAK OUT WHEN HE SEES IT AND HEARS IT. IF ANYTHING, WE'LL GET IT DONE, DAD GETS IT HOME, AT LEAST I'LL BE ABLE TO BORROW IT. THINGS ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD UNDERNEATH POPS' WILLYS HERE. I GOT THE ONE SIDE ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE CROSSMEMBER ON THE EXHAUST. TRYING TO MATCH THE OTHER SIDE THE BEST I CAN WITH THE OBSTACLES I HAVE TO GO AROUND. ONCE I GET BACK TO THE CROSSMEMBERS, THEN I CAN DREAM UP WHATEVER I'M GOING TO COME UP WITH FOR THE TAILPIPES. FINALLY GOT THE PASSENGER SIDE PIPE ALL MADE. IT MATCHES THE DRIVER SIDE PRETTY WELL. WE GOT THE LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TO POPS' EXHAUST HERE. GOING TO GET IT INSTALLED, AND THE EXHAUST WILL BE COMPLETE AND MOVE ON TO THE REST OF THE PROJECT. PERFORMANCE-WISE, HAVING CUSTOM MANUALS WITH NO KINKS IN THEM OR RESTRICTIONS IN THEM, WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT EXHAUST OUT WHERE IT BELONGS AND BUILD SOME MORE HORSEPOWER. A LOT OF WORK, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT, ESPECIALLY FOR POPS. HE WOULD'VE DONE IT FOR ME, SO WHY SHOULDN'T I DO IT FOR HIM? THIS IS THE CENTER CONSOLE FOR THE CHEVELLE. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE THE IGNITION, AND WE'RE GOING TO HIDE IT INSIDE THE GLOVE BOX. WE'RE GOING TO DO POWER WINDOW SWITCHES. AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE RADIO OUT OF THE DASH, AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT DOWN HERE WITH A 7-INCH TOUCHSCREEN. THIS IS THE POWER WINDOW SWITCH TEMPLATE. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WRAP THIS IN LEATHER. BRIAN IS THE MAN WHEN IT COMES TO INTERIORS, AND THIS CHEVELLE INTERIOR IS GOING TO BE REALLY NICE. WE HAVE CUSTOM DOOR PANELS, CUSTOM CENTER CONSOLE, CUSTOM FRONT SEAT, CUSTOM REAR SEAT. IT'S ALL COOL STUFF. ALL OF IT'S ONE-OFF, AND BRIAN'S JUST GOING TO NAIL IT. THINGS ARE MOVING RIGHT ALONG ON THE CHEVELLE CONSOLE. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MEASURE UP AND SEW UP A HEADLINER TO MATCH. SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COOL TO GET THE CHEVELLE A CUSTOM ENGINE COLOR. SO I HAD JASON DO SOME SPRAY-OUTS, AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO REALLY STAND OUT IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. ON THIS CHEVELLE, WE HAVE PUT A BUNCH OF BLACK ACCENTS ALL OVER THE MOTOR. SO WE THOUGHT WHY NOT PAINT THE MOTOR SOMETHING BRIGHT AND SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND LET'S GO WITH A LITTLE FLAT RED, MAKE IT STAND OUT INSIDE OF THAT NICE GLOSSY BLACK ENGINE BAY. NOAH, THIS DOESN'T FIT. OH,. DON'T SCRATCH IT. WHY ARE YOU GUYS TRYING TO PUT EXHAUST ON THIS PLASTIC MOCK-UP MOTOR? PLASTIC, HUH? WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS WE COULD PAINT EVERYTHING SHINY, LIKE WHAT EVERYBODY ALWAYS DOES. WE CAN'T EVER, YOU KNOW, DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND WE'VE GOT TO BE THE SAME. AND BY THE WAY, THE ONE THAT SIGNS OUR CHECKS LIKED THE SPRAY-OUT. - SO SELL IT TO ME. - I THINK IT'S COOL. - SELL IT TO YOU? - YEAH. I JUST PAINED ALL THIS UPPER INTAKE PIECE IS ALL THE SAME SATIN BLACK. EVERYTHING, ALL THE PLUMBING, EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING INTO THE PROCHARGER IS ALL SATIN BLACK. I THINK IT'S ALL GOING TO LOOK NICE. BUT THIS MATCHES THE LEATHER COMPLETELY. THIS IS THE SAME COLOR THAT WE WERE GOING TO PAINT THE CAGE. WE WANT TO KEEP ALL THE SAME COLOR FLOWING. OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I THINK ONCE EVERYTHING'S BOLTED ON IT, I THINK IT'S GOING TO LOOK SHARP. AND IF IT DOESN'T? - YEAH. - I DON'T KNOW. HE'S SHAKING HIS HEAD. I DON'T KNOW. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GETTING READY TO PAINT A MOTOR. - ME? - YUP. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING I'M NOT PAINTING IT AGAIN. - NO? - NO. I DO NOT KNOW WHY CHARLES IS ALL OVER THIS BECAUSE NOAH SIGNS OFF ON IT. AND CHARLES IS ALL WHAT NOAH SAYS, SO I THOUGHT WE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE. FOR SOME REASON, WE'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. WHERE ARE THE OTHER PIECES YOU PAINTED? - YEAH, COULD WE -- - LET'S HOLD SOME UP. LET'S PUT A COUPLE OF PIECES ON THERE. WHERE ARE THEY AT? LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE DONE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'M GUILTY OF APPROVING THE SPRAY-OUT CARD FOR THIS ENGINE. HOWEVER, WHEN I SEE IT RIGHT NOW, I CAN'T FREAKING STAND IT. IT LOOKS LIKE A PLASTIC MOTOR IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. IT LOOKS SO BAD. IT LOOKS BAD. SEE, AND THEN WE SET THIS ON THERE. UH-HUH. YEAH. - YEAH. CHARLES AND I HATE THE WAY THE FLAT RED LOOKS ON THIS MOTOR, SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO FLAT-OUT TELL JASON, LET HIM BITCH ABOUT IT AND FREAK OUT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO FLY AT THE MOMENT. DUDE, THERE'S NO WAY. NOAH'S GOT THE FINAL SAY. HE SIGNS YOUR CHECK. WHAT IS IT, NOAH? IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT'S BEEN OUTSIDE IN THE SUN AND FADED. I PERSONALLY HATE IT AT THE MOMENT. THAT BEING SAID, I'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE. MAYBE ONCE WE PUT EVERYTHING ON IT, IT'LL LOOK LESS LIKE A MOCK-UP MOTOR AND MORE LIKE A REAL MOTOR. LET'S PUT IT TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS GOOD. - ALL RIGHT. AND I ALSO THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY. SO YOU CAN CALL THAT PLACE YOU JUST GOT THE JOB FROM AND TELL THEM YOU'RE NOT COMING. OKAY, I'LL DO THAT. I'LL DO THAT. - ALL RIGHT. COOL. - ALL RIGHT. - THANKS. - YEP. COMING DOWN TO A MOMENT HERE ON THE WILLYS. DAD'S HAD IT FOR 37 YEARS. HE'S HAD FOUR DIFFERENT ENGINES IN IT. WE'RE GOING TO SURPRISE HIM WITH A REALLY COOL INTAKE TO SIT ON TOP OF HIS LS MOTOR. WE CHOSE THIS INTAKE JUST BECAUSE OF THE WOW FACTOR IT'S GOING TO HAVE WHEN YOU OPEN THE HOOD. SO THIS THING IS JUST GOING TO STAND OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB, BUT IN A GOOD WAY. THESE ARE THE INJECTORS. I LIKE TO TRY TO HIDE THE PIGTAIL CONNECTORS A LITTLE BIT ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE RAIL. I GOT MY FUEL RAILS. FIT NICELY. AND I ALSO GOT DAD, FOR THE WILLYS, A 102-MILLIMETER THROTTLE BODY. IT'S GOT GREAT LOOKS AND SHOULD HAVE QUITE A BIT OF PERFORMANCE UPGRADE FROM FACTORY. THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO LET AIR INTO THE ENGINE. SOUND EFFECTS. AWESOME. WELL, I GOT THIS INTAKE ALL ASSEMBLED, AND NOW I'VE GOT TO GO PUT IT ON. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS. SO I'VE MADE PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS HERE GETTING ALL THE PAINTED BRACKETS AND EVERYTHING ON THE CHEVELLE MOTOR. TRYING TO GET SOME MORE THINGS BOLTED UP TO IT, ACCESSORIES AND WHATNOT. AND IT'S STARTING TO REALLY, I THINK, PULL THE COLOR TOGETHER. IT OUGHT TO BE PRETTY MEAN-LOOKING. IT'S MOTOR INSTALL TIME. TRYING TO DROP IT IN, LIKE, FOR THE 74TH TIME, AND... DON'T SCRATCH THE FIREWALL. DO NOT SCRATCH THE FIREWALL. YEAH, COME ON DOWN. WE'RE LOOKING REAL GOOD, MAN. THIS THING'S GOING TO LOOK PRETTY MEAN IN HERE. THE TRANSMISSION IN THIS CHEVELLE IS A REALLY NICE TURBO 400 WITH A HIGH-END TORQUE CONVERTER. THIS THING WILL TAKE A BEATING ALL DAY LONG. IT'S NOT GOING TO BREAK WITH THE HORSEPOWER. AND SO YOU CAN DRIVE THIS THING ON THE HIGHWAY REALLY WELL, WE'VE GOT A GEAR VENDORS OVERDRIVE. SO ABSOLUTE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS ON THIS THING. - ARE YOU READY? - GET A MAN ON THE PEDAL. IT NEEDS TO TILT BACKWARDS JUST A LITTLE BIT. NO, IT'S PRETTY EVEN. IT'S LOOKING KILLER. I'M REALLY DIGGING THE FLAT RED UNDERNEATH HERE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE KIND OF BLACKED OUT. WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT THE CROSSMEMBER IN AND GET THAT LAID OUT AND THEN KIND OF PROBABLY START DOING THE EXHAUST ON IT AND GET THAT HUNG BACK ON THERE. WHAT'S UP, WEASEL? - OH, HEY! - COME ON OVER, MAN. ORIGINAL PARTS GROUP SENT OVER ALL THE CHEVELLE STUFF IN A MATTER OF A COUPLE DAYS. I KNOW YOU WERE COMPLAINING OVER AND OVER AND OVER. - YEP. YEP, YOU KNOW IT. - THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. SO HERE'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED. YOU WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO MAKE SURE? YEAH, WE BETTER DO THAT. - HERE WE ARE. - WOW, THERE WE GO. ALL THE GOOD STUFF RIGHT HERE. MOLDINGS! - AWESOME. THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE WAITING ON. YOU WANT TO PAINT ALL THESE, RIGHT? WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A NICE SHINING MOLDING AND PAINT IT BLACK. AND THEN ALSO THE CORNER PIECES FOR THAT GRILLE. YES, YES. - YOU NEED THESE, TOO. - ALL RIGHT. COOL. WE'RE READY TO GO. NOW THERE'S NO EXCUSES. THE CAR'S GOING TO BE DONE. - YEP! THERE WILL NOT BE NO EXCUSES. -RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE SO YOU CAN GET THIS STUFF PAINTED. - AWESOME. THANK YOU. - THANKS. - ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT OUR BUMPERS HERE FOR OUR '69 CHEVELLE. WE HAVE JUST SHAVED THEM SO IT GIVES THEM A NICE CLEAN LOOK. ONCE WE HAVE THEM ON THE CAR, WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PAINT THEM BODY COLOR SO IT REALLY GIVES THEM A REAL NICE, CLEAN TOUCH. GOT ALL THESE PARTS ALL SEALED UP. GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT SOME BLACK DOWN. LET'S SPRAY THIS. WELL, IT'S CRUNCH TIME HERE ON DAD'S WILLYS. WE'VE GOT THE EXHAUST ALL FABRICATED AND PUT ON. WE'VE GOT THE WIRING ALL DONE. WE'VE GOT THE FUEL INJECTION SET UP. AND I'VE GOT SCOTT AND A COUPLE OF OTHER GUYS OVER HERE THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECT TO HELP ME FINISH THIS THING UP. WE'RE READY TO GET IT TO HIM. IN 1937, THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN LS1 IN HERE. I BELIEVE IT HAD A FOUR-CYLINDER IN IT, INLINE FOUR. WE'RE TRYING TO STICK 5 POUNDS OF STUFF IN A 2-POUND BAG. THIS ENGINE'S BASICALLY A 2004 CORVETTE LS1. WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH ABOUT 400 HORSEPOWER WITH THIS. I WOULD SAY PROBABLY ABOUT 370 FOOT-POUNDS OF TORQUE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEN JUST HAVE THE WOW FACTOR OF THE INTAKE AND THE ENGINE BAY BEING SO SMALL THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU OPEN THE HOOD, THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS THE FABRICATED MANIFOLD AND THE BILLET FUEL RAILS. IT'S JUST GOING TO TOP IT OFF REAL NICE. POWER TO WEIGHT ON THIS THING IS JUST GOING TO BE AWESOME. I JUST HOPE DAD HAS A SPONSOR FOR SOME TIRE COMPANY BECAUSE HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BOIL THE TIRES OFF THIS THING EVERY TIME HE DRIVES IT. IT'S BEEN 37 LONG YEARS ON DAD'S WILLYS. THIS IS FINALLY GOING TO BE THE MOMENT. I'M NOT GOING TO LIE. I'M PRETTY NERVOUS RIGHT NOW. I MEAN, WE'RE ALL PRETTY GOOD GUYS. WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WANT IT TO GO RIGHT, THAT'S ALL. SO HERE IT GOES! YOU READY, ERIC? - YEAH. SHOULD WE, LIKE, DO A COUNTDOWN? - NO, JUST DO IT. - A SONG? I'M TOO NERVOUS. WE DO THOSE BEFORE EXPLOSIONS. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. - ALL RIGHT. - COME ON, PAUL. I'VE GOT FAITH IN YOU, BROTHER. - OKAY, HERE WE GO. - LET'S GO. NOT SOUNDING GOOD. GOT A LEAK. GOT A LEAK. GOT A LEAK. SHUT IT OFF. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. THIS WHOLE TIME DAD'S CAR'S BEEN HERE, HE JUST THOUGHT WE WERE STORING IT FOR HIM WHILE HIS GARAGE WAS GETTING SOME WORK DONE. TOMORROW HE WANTS IT BACK, SO WE HAVE TO GET IT DONE TONIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? ALL THAT CHROME AIN'T GOING TO GET YOU HOME. WELCOME TO "LOVE TUNE-UP." "DEAR LOVE TUNE-UP, MY BOYFRIEND IS CONSTANTLY MAKING SURE HIS TIMING IS RIGHT ON HIS MUSTANG, YET HE IS NEVER ON TIME FOR ANYTHING IN OUR RELATIONSHIP. PLEASE HELP. SINCERELY, CINDY." WELL, CINDY, IT TAKES TWO, YOU KNOW. IT TAKES THE CRANK SHAFT AND THE CAM SHAFT TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND GET THE TIMING RIGHT. THE CAM SHAFT COMES WITH ITS OWN SCHEDULE OF EVENTS. THESE EVENTS CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED IF THE CAM SHAFT IS INSTALLED AT THE DEGREE OF INSTALLATION IT'S DESIGNED AROUND. IF THIS ISN'T TAKEN CARE OF, IT CAN RESULT IN POOR PERFORMANCE, POSSIBLY EVEN FAILURE. HOWEVER, NONE OF THIS IS ACCURATE UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY IS GIVEN TO FIND TRUE TOP DEAD CENTER, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. THANKS, CINDY. I HOPE ALL THIS HELPS. NOT SOUNDING GOOD. GOT A LEAK. GOT A LEAK. GOT A LEAK. SHUT IT OFF. BEEN WORKING ON DAD'S '37 WILLYS ALL NIGHT LONG. JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HEAR IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 37 YEARS, GOT NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. WE'VE GOT TO GET THESE PROBLEMS FIGURED OUT QUICKLY BECAUSE THIS THING GETS TAKEN BACK TO HIM TOMORROW. ONE OF THE INJECTORS. WELL, WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF INJECTORS LEAKING. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY JUST GOT UNEVEN PRESSURE WITH THE NEW RAILS AND EVERYTHING BOLTED DOWN OR IF AN O-RING GOT CUT OR WHAT. WELL, WE PUT A BIGGER INJECTOR O-RING, JUST SLIGHTLY LARGER, ON THE UPPER PART OF THE NUMBER TWO INJECTOR. AND THEN WE ALSO TWEAKED THE MOUNTING BRACKETS JUST A LITTLE BIT TO MATCH THE MANIFOLD A LITTLE BETTER AND ALSO SHIMMED THE MOUNTING BRACKET SO THE INJECTOR ISN'T BOTTOMED OUT IN THERE. I THINK IT WAS PUTTING UNEVEN PRESSURE ON IT. ALL RIGHT. SO WE ABOUT READY TO TRY IT AGAIN? - YEAH. - GOOD. I HOPE. GO AHEAD, PAULY D. - WHOO! - ALL RIGHT! I'M STILL WATCHING THE GAUGES HERE, MAKING SURE EVERYTHING IS GOOD. THIS IS AMAZING TO HEAR THE WILLYS FIRE UP. I DON'T HAVE HALF THE HISTORY THAT SOME OF THESE GUYS DO WITH THE CAR. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CAR SINCE PAUL WAS 6 YEARS OLD. SO FOR HIM, IT'S GOT TO BE THE BEST THING EVER. HOW DO YOU FEEL, PAUL? I'M FEELING ECSTATIC ABOUT IT. IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE MOMENT, AND I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I MEAN, I ACTUALLY COULDN'T EVEN PREPARE MYSELF FOR THIS MOMENT. IT'S BEEN SO LONG. WOW. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS WILLYS DONE FOR PAUL'S DAD. RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO DELIVER IT TO HIM TOMORROW. WE'VE GOT GUYS ADJUSTED THE WINDOWS, THE HOOD, THE TRUNK. WE STILL GOT TO PUT THE WHOLE INTERIOR BACK IN IT. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET IT WRAPPED UP SOON. IT MEANS A LOT, YOU KNOW, FOR PAUL ESPECIALLY, TO KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE HIS BACK AND THAT WE WANT TO HELP HIM. AND SOMETHING THIS SPECIAL, LIKE A CAR LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S A FATHER AND SON PROJECT... I MEAN, WITHOUT A DOUBT, WE'RE ALL GOING TO PITCH IN. I THINK PAUL'S DAD IS GOING TO FREAK OUT WHEN HE SEES THIS. FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, HE HAS NO IDEA THIS IS COMING, SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED TO SEE THE REACTION ON PAUL'S DAD'S FACE. IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD MOMENT. I'M GOING TO KNOCK OUT THE STRIPES ON THE CHEVELLE REAL QUICK BEFORE WE HEAD OUT TO REVEAL THE WILLYS. WE'RE GIVING IT JUST ONE BIG AGGRESSIVE FLAT GRAY STRIPE TO BREAK UP SOME OF THIS BLACK, GIVE IT A PRETTY MEAN LOOK. THE ONE PET PEEVE OF MINE WHENEVER PEOPLE ARE LAYING OUT RACING STRIPES IS WHEN THEIR CORNERS DON'T MATCH. SO WHAT I DO IS I TAKE AN EMPTY TAPE ROLL, JUST LINE IT UP WITH THE TWO EDGES. THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW THE CURVE OF THE CIRCLE. YOU HAVE A NICE ROUND CORNER, AND THERE YOU GO. IT LOOKS PRETTY NICE. WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SPRAY OUT SOME RED ALL AROUND THE EDGE OF THIS. THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US OUR RED TRACER LINE. THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND LAY DOWN A DARK ARGENT COLOR, AND THAT SHOULD SET THIS THING OFF. IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY BITCHING CAR. TODAY IS THE BIG DAY. WE'RE REVEALING DAD'S CAR TO HIM. WE'RE GOING TO SURPRISE THE HECK OUT OF HIM. HE HAS NO IDEA. I'M FILLED WITH EMOTION, FILLED WITH NERVOUSNESS, EXCITEMENT, ALL THREE OF THEM BUNDLED UP INTO ONE. THIS IS CRAZY. GOD, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I WASN'T SURE IT WAS MY CAR. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS. THEN I SAW EVERYBODY STANDING UP HERE, AND I... I BET YOU NEED A BEER. I KNOW I DO. AS I WAS COMING AROUND THE CORNER, ALL THE GUYS BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY, I WAS COMING UP BEHIND THEM. I JUST -- HIS REACTION, I JUST KNEW WE HAD HIM. I JUST KNEW IT. MY HEART'S ABOUT TO JUMP OUT NOW. I'M JUST SHOCKED TO SEE IT AND JUST IN DISBELIEF. I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD EVER HAPPEN, BUT IT DID. DID IT TURN OUT LIKE YOU THINK IT WOULD? YES. IT'S BETTER. YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING. THIS CAR HAS BEEN IN MY LIFE SINCE '81, AND I WANTED SOMETHING TO MAKE A STREET ROD OUT OF, SO I FINALLY FOUND THIS ONE. AND I NEVER DID THINK IT WOULD BE DONE TO THIS LEVEL AT ALL. WANT TO CHECK IT OUT? LOOK UNDER THE HOOD? NOT ONLY DID THE GUYS AND I SURPRISE YOU WITH GETTING THE CAR DONE, BUT THERE'S A FEW SURPRISES IN IT. WE GOT RID OF YOUR OLD INTAKE AND WE GOT YOU SOMETHING A LITTLE FABRICATED-LOOKING. BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL. WELL, YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT ABOUT 400 HORSEPOWER. IS THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU? YEAH, IT'S PERFECT. TOO MUCH FOR ME. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS BETWEEN HERE AND THE LIQUOR STORE, ANYWAY. SO WE'VE GOT AN ALL-STAINLESS EXHAUST SYSTEM ON THE WILLYS, AND IT SOUNDS AWESOME. FOR THE SUSPENSION, THERE'S A MUSTANG II RACK-AND-PINION UP FRONT AND A FOUR-LINK IN THE BACK WITH A BEEFY 9-INCH POSI. MY GOD, IT'S IS AMAZING. CUSTOM DOOR PANELS. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW IT TURNED OUT, THOUGH, YOU KNOW? REAR SPEAKER SHELF. MY GOD. BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, GUYS. JEEZ. DID YOU EVER EXPECT IT TO TURN OUT LIKE THAT? NO, SIR. I NEVER EXPECTED IT TO BE DONE. -THERE YOU GO. I THINK YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE THIS THING FOR A DRIVE. GO AROUND THE DRIVER'S SIDE, WHERE YOU BELONG. AFRAID I'LL BREAK SOMETHING. HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO PEEL RUBBER WHEN HE LEAVES THEIR HOUSE, AND, YOU KNOW, HE WANTS IT TO SOUND PHENOMENAL, AND THAT'S WHAT IT DOES. IT'S THE PERFECT PACKAGE. THAT IS AMAZING. THE DREAM IS REAL! THE WHOLE DAMN DASH LOOKS AWESOME. EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL. HOPE YOU ENJOY IT FOR A LIFETIME. THAT I'M GOING TO. GOT TO. I'VE HAD IT HALF A LIFETIME, SO... TODAY WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL DAYS IN MY LIFE, OTHER THAN THE BIRTH OF MY DAUGHTER AND MAYBE MY MARRIAGE, YOU KNOW. IT ALL KIND OF TIES TOGETHER BECAUSE WITHOUT FAMILY, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S EVEN REALLY HIT ME YET, THAT THIS SAME OLD CAR HIS FRIENDS USED TO ARM-WRESTLE ON AND DRINK BEER AND SPILL IT ALL OVER THE PLACE WHILE THEY WERE SANDING ON IT, YOU KNOW. THAT THING WAS NEVER GOING TO GET PAINTED. IT JUST WASN'T. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A REAL CAR. AND NOW IT IS. IT'S JUST A VERY, VERY, VERY EMOTIONAL DAY, AND I'LL NEVER, EVER FORGET IT. AAH! I GOT YOU! EVEN IN FINAL ASSEMBLY, THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO ON THIS CHEVELLE. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THIS THING WRAPPED UP AND ON THE STREETS. WE'RE JUST GOING OVER ALL THE LITTLE ODDS AND ENDS NOW, ALL THE LITTLE GREMLINS THAT WE TRY TO WORK OUT, YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE TRY TO FIRE IT. YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO PRIME THE SYSTEM UP AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE SOME THUNDER. WOW. THAT'S AWESOME! - SHE'S ALIVE NOW. YOU SHOULD BE PROUD, MAN. YOU SHOULD BE PROUD. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR. THIS IS A BAD BITCH. IS YOUR HAND SHAKING? WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE CHEVELLE TO THE TRACK, WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE AT HOME. THAT THING IS STUPID FAST. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD A CAR QUITE AT THIS LEVEL. WELL, THE LAST CAR WE DID FOR YOU WAS THE BIG PIMPING '76 EL DORADO. YEAH. I THINK I HEAR IT COMING. YEAH, WHAT'S THAT NOISE? THERE IT IS. - OH, MAN. WOW. - THE AIRPLANE IS LANDING. OH, MAN. OH, MAN. THIS THING IS FREAKING MEAN. THIS IS A ROCKET ON FOUR TIRES. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FREAKING MISSILE. HEY, DUSTIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. DUSTIN, THIS IS GREAT. YEAH, THE ENGINEER BEHIND THE PROJECT. - THANK YOU, SIR. - DUSTIN MADE IT ALL HAPPEN. - MY PLEASURE, MAN. - YEAH. THE BODY AND THE FINISH LOOKS AWESOME. WE THOUGHT, SINCE WE WERE GOING WITH THE RED IN THE INTERIOR, WE'D BRING A LITTLE BIT OUT ON THE OUTSIDE, SO WE'VE GOT THIS REALLY COOL ARGENT STRIPE WITH THE RED GOING AROUND IT. - I LIKE THE RED. IT PROVIDES REALLY NICE CONTRAST. SO THE ORIGINAL BACK END WAS KIND OF ROUGH. WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS, OVER-THE-TOP, TRACK-READY SUSPENSION. THE CAR IS STIFF. IT'S VERY STRONG. - GOOD, GOOD. AND THERE'S JUST A TON OF HORSEPOWER. IT HANDLES LIKE A DREAM. IT'S AWESOME. AND I REALLY LIKE THE WHEEL/TIRE COMBINATION. YES, IT'S KILLER. WE WANTED TO HAVE MASSIVE TIRES ON THE BACK AND ON THE FRONT. RIGHT, RIGHT. SO WE HAVE 22-INCH WHEELS ON THE BACK. - OKAY. - 20-INCH WHEELS ON THE FRONT. THEY'RE ONE-OFF BILLET WHEELS MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS CAR. WE SENT CUSTOM MEASUREMENTS IN. - OKAY. WE HAD THEM MADE JUST FOR YOU AND FOR THIS CAR. HUGE BRAKES UP FRONT. HUGE BRAKES IN THE REAR. LET ME SHOW YOU THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. - YES, SIR. - IT'S PRETTY WILD. LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE. OH, MY... WOW, WOW, WOW. THIS IS LIKE A SHOWROOM RIGHT HERE. IT'S VERY, VERY CLEAN. IT'S VERY CUSTOM AS WELL. WE HAVE A DART SMALL-BLOCK, AND IT'S ALL FOURS INTERNAL. IT'S A REALLY HIGH-END BUILD. SO IT'S A ROCKET. IT IS A FULLY ENGINEERED, WILD ROCKET SHIP. - WOW. - YOU'VE GOT A BIG PROCHARGER, BUT WITH ALL THAT CRAZY STUFF GOING ON, YOU STILL HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. THAT IS A MIRACLE RIGHT THERE. WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT ALL IN ONE PACKAGE. WE'VE GOT REMOTE ADJUSTABLE RIDETECH SHOCKS. YOU COULD DIAL THIS THING INTO YOUR EXACT LIKING. ALL THIS PIPING IS ONE-OFF FABRICATED. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T DO TO THIS? - THERE IS NOTHING WE DIDN'T DO. - THERE'S NO WINGS. WOW. IT'S SO CLEAN, AND IT'S DELIVERING POWER THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE YOU WOULD GET THAT MUCH POWER OUT OF ALL THAT STUFF IN ONE LITTLE SPOT. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE TAKING THE TRAINING WHEELS OFF. YEAH, THE TRAINING WHEELS ARE OFFICIALLY OFF. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW. SO I WORK WITH BRIAN, AND WE WANTED TO TURN OUT AN INTERIOR THAT WAS 100 PERCENT CUSTOM, YOU KNOW, AND BUILT AROUND YOU DOWN TO THE DOOR PANELS. - WOW. - THE SEATS, THE DASH. I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. CUSTOM PEDALS, THE STEERING COLUMN IS ADJUSTABLE UP AND DOWN. ON THE DASH WE HAVE THESE REALLY CLEAN BILLET CONTROLLERS FOR THE VINTAGE AIR SYSTEM. CUSTOM CENTER CONSOLE. IN THE CENTER CONSOLE, WE'VE GOT YOUR CONTROLS FOR THE POWER WINDOWS. - OKAY. INSIDE THE CONSOLE, WE'VE GOT A STEREO. IT'S ALL OVER-THE-TOP COMPONENTS. YOU THINK THIS CAR IS LOUD? THIS STEREO SYSTEM IS WILD. AND THEN, UP ABOVE THAT, WE'VE GOT THE CONTROLLER THAT SHOWS US EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ENGINE. IT'S VERY PROGRAMMABLE, SO IT LETS US RUN WITH A LOT OF HORSEPOWER AND ALSO KEEP IT SAFE. I'M SPEECHLESS, WHICH IS UNUSUAL. TOTAL PACKAGE. IT'S EXCELLENT. IT LOOKS GOOD. TELL THE CREW THEY DID AN AWESOME JOB. IT'S ONE OF A KIND. - THANK YOU. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT IN IT AND... - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. - ...SEE HOW IT FEELS? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A BIG DUDE. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU FIT JUST FINE. I MEAN, I'M ABOUT 6-4. I'VE STILL GOT HEAD ROOM. NOAH, I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU ONE THING. WHERE IS THE KEY? - IT'S IN THE CENTER CONSOLE. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. I NEEDED TO KNOW. ALL RIGHT. YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO. WHEN I TURNED THE KEY ON, IT WAS LIKE STARTING A ROCKET SHIP. OH, MAN! OH, NOAH. NOAH! - GIVE IT A LITTLE GAS. IT'S A BEAST. OH, MAN. SO WE GOT ONE THING LEFT TO DO. YEAH, I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT IS. WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE THIS THING. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. - ALL RIGHT. TELL ME ABOUT THE STEERING. YEAH, IT'S VERY TIGHT. IT'S VERY, VERY RESPONSIVE. YOU'VE GOT TWO CONTROL ARMS UP FRONT. IT'S A HANDLING MACHINE. OH, MY. YOU SURE WE DON'T HAVE A PARACHUTE? OH, MY. OH, MY. LOTS OF POWER. GETTING YOUR BLOOD FLOWING? YEAH. GLAD I PISSED EARLIER. RIGHT. DRIVING THAT CAR IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE. IT'S LIKE A RACEHORSE. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
