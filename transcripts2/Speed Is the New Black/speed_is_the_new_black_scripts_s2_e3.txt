 WE'RE THE SHOP FOR YOU. BECAUSE HERE, SPEED IS THE NEW BLACK. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ALL RIGHT, ANDREW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS AWESOME NOMAD IN. - YEAH. SURE, SURE. - VERY, VERY COOL CAR. THE CHEVY NOMAD -- IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE CARS OF ALL TIME. THEY'RE SUPER-RARE. THE STYLING'S THERE, BUT I LOVE SOME SPEED. SO I CANNOT WAIT TO HEAR WHAT ANDREW HAS IN STORE FOR US. SO, TELL ME, WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE NOMAD THAT DOES IT FOR YOU? WHY THE NOMAD, AND, YOU KNOW, WHY NOT SOMETHING ELSE? WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A TRI-FIVE, RIGHT? RIGHT. AND BEING A CHEVY GUY, YOU'RE EITHER GONNA GET A CORVETTE OR A TRI-FIVE OR BOTH. THE TRI-FIVE ERA INCLUDES THE '55, '56, '57 CHEVY. IT'S AN AWESOME ERA FOR CHEVY DESIGN WHERE THEY MADE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARS THEY'VE EVER CREATED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TRI-FIVE, THIS WAS THE HEIGHT OF CHEVY AND THE AEROSPACE ENGINEERING WITH THE HUGE FINS. OH, YEAH.AND, YOU KNOW, IT WAS ICONIC. YOU KNOW, MY DREAM FOR THIS PROJECT, FOR THIS CAR, IS THAT I HAVE AN AUTOMOBILE THAT I CAN USE WITH MY FAMILY TO TAKE ANYWHERE, WHETHER IT'S HOCKEY PRACTICE, GOING TO MY IN-LAWS, OR GOING TO MY PARENTS' HOUSE, PACK THE KIDS IN IT, PACK ALL THEIR STUFF IN IT, BUT STILL HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S FUN TO DRIVE AND NOT BE IN MY WIFE'S S.U.V. LOOKING FOR SIX-SPEED... ALL RIGHT....LOTS OF HORSEPOWER... GOOD....LOTS OF GOOD STOPPING POWER. OKAY. AND IN TERMS OF GENERAL STYLING ON THE CAR, IT'S PRETTY MUCH TO DIE FOR JUST AS IT IS. WHAT KIND OF DIRECTION ARE YOU LEANING TO IN TERMS OF STAYING, LIKE, YOU KNOW, REALLY STOCK ON THE OUTSIDE OR GOING FULLY CUSTOM? I LIKE THE STOCK LOOK OF IT. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S ICONIC.RIGHT. YEAH. AND I THINK THAT I WANT TO STAY TRUE TO THAT. DRESS UP THE WHEELS A LITTLE BIT. OKAY. SO, YOU POP OPEN THE HOOD. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE UNDER HERE? WELL, OBVIOUSLY, AN ENGINE. I WANT FUEL-INJECTED. OKAY. I WANT A SUPERCHARGER ON IT.ALL RIGHT. SO, I THINK THE COOL THING ABOUT THE '57 NOMAD IS, IT IS A STATION WAGON, RIGHT? WE POP A BIG ENGINE IN THERE, AND IT'S GONNA BE LIKE DRIVING A SPORTS CAR. LET'S LOOK AT THE INTERIOR REAL QUICK. VERY, VERY STOCK. AND ARE YOU FEELING LIKE YOU WANT A TOTALLY FRESH, BRAND-NEW STOCK INTERIOR, OR DO YOU WANT TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT? I LIKE THE STOCK DASH IN IT, BUT SEAT-WISE, I WANT TO GO WITH BUCKETS IN IT. RIGHT. THE BIG THING, WHY I WENT FOR THE NOMAD, IS THE CARGO ROOM, I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO DRIVE THEM TO HOCKEY IN.RIGHT. I WANT IT TO BE COMFORTABLE FOR EVERYDAY USE. RIGHT. BUT, HEY, MY KIDS ARE 7 AND 9. SURE. THEY'RE GONNA BE DROPPING CRACKERS IN THE BACK. THERE YOU GO. SO, LUXURIOUS, YET KIND OF PRACTICAL.RIGHT. RIGHT. I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO AN AWESOME JOB. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, SIR. THANKS FOR COMING IN. YEAH. ♪♪ '57 HEAVEN.RESALE RED. LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY'S '57 NOMAD. Noah: IT DOES LOOK LIKE EVERYBODY'S '57 NOMAD, BUT HE WANTS TO CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. Charles: SO, IS HE A PERFORMANCE JUNKIE? IS HE MORE OF A CRUISE-AROUND-TOWN KIND OF GUY? WHAT IS HE? HE KIND OF WANTS IT ALL, WHICH IS COOL. SO, HE WANTS TO DRIVE THE CAR A LOT, AND HE WANTS TO TAKE HIS TWO SONS TO HOCKEY PRACTICE IN IT. HE ALSO WANTS SOME POWER. HE'S FINE WITH LOWERING IT DOWN. HE'S THINKING IF WE CAN USE THE ORIGINAL CHASSIS, BUT IMPROVE EVERYTHING A WHOLE LOT, THAT WOULD BE A WINNER. HE WANTS A MODERN DRIVETRAIN, AND HE DOES WANT A SIX-SPEED, SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. SIX-SPEED'S REALLY COOL.YEAH. RIGHT? EVERYBODY'S GOING MODERN. I'D LOVE IF WE, LIKE, WENT BACK TO A SMALL-BLOCK WITH SIX TWO-BARRELS, POP THE HOOD, AND IT'S, LIKE, FULL-BLOWN NOSTALGIC-LOOKING. I WAS THINKING OF DOING AN LSA. THOUGHT THAT'D BE PRETTY COOL. MAYBE WE COULD DRESS THAT THING UP SOMEHOW. YEAH.SOMETHING DIFFERENT. CHECK OUT THE INTERIOR. REAL QUICK. THE ONE THING ON THESE THAT, I MEAN -- YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THOSE HEADLINER BOWS. THAT'S MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS WHOLE INTERIOR. KIND OF MATCHES THE RIBS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY. YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S AN AWESOME DESIGN. WE'RE GONNA DO A TIMELESS INTERIOR. THE OUTSIDE, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF PLAY ROOM. WE CAN CHANGE SOME STUFF AROUND. BUT HE WANTS IT TO STILL PERFORM REALLY WELL -- LS SUPERCHARGED ENGINE, FLAT STANCE, NOT A BIG RAKE. I THINK WE CAN DO IT, AND IT'S GONNA LOOK NICE. I THINK WE GOT A GOOD PLAN. KEEP IT CLASSY... TILL SCOTT TOUCHES IT. ♪♪ THE FIRST STEP ON THE NOMAD IS TO STRIP IT DOWN, TAKE OFF ALL THE PIECES AND TRIM WE WANT, AND GET RID OF EVERYTHING ELSE WE DON'T NEED. WE'RE GONNA KEEP ALL THESE SCREWS FROM THE TRIM IN HIS CAR, BUT THERE'S MAYBE THREE THAT ACTUALLY BELONG HERE. WE'VE GOT SCREWS THAT ARE MADE FOR WOOD. WE'VE GOT SCREWS THAT ARE TOO SHORT. WE HAVE SCREWS THAT ARE GLUED IN THE HOLES. SO WE'VE GOT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN ONE CAR. ♪♪ WHOA! YES. YEAH. THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP YOUR COW FROM LEAKING APPARENTLY. YOU FILL IT FULL OF BATHTUB CAULK. WELL, WE'VE BARELY JUST GOT INTO THIS CAR, AND SO FAR, WE'VE FOUND ALL KINDS OF MISMATCHED HARDWARE. AND THEN WE GOT A COWL THAT'S FULL OF BATHTUB CAULK TO KEEP IT FROM LEAKING, WHICH IS AMAZING. THIS CAR IS FULL OF SURPRISES. YEAH. THIS IS SOUND DEADENER. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO HOLD ON MOLDINGS. WE GOT THREE DIFFERENT SCREWS HOLDING THIS ARMREST ON. DRYWALL ANCHOR. I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. MORE VELCRO. IT'S, LIKE, A PIECE OF PLYWOOD SHOVED UP IN THE WINDOW FRAME. THERE'S A BUNCH OF PAINT STICKS GLUED TO THE B PILLAR, TOO. YEAH. NOTHING BUT THE BEST. ANY TIME YOU STRIP A CAR DOWN AND FIND THIS MUCH JANKY **** HOLDING IT TOGETHER, YOU CANNOT HELP BUT WORRY WHAT OTHER PROBLEMS ARE LURKING RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE. I DON'T THINK THIS SPARE TIRE'S GONNA DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD. IS IT FLAT? [ LAUGHS ] WELL, THERE'S A RIM. I'M A BROKEN MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THIS WHOLE CAR IS HELD TOGETHER WITH TOOTHPICKS AND DUCT TAPE, DOUBLE-SIDED TAPE, PAINT STICKS, BOLTS THAT DON'T MATCH, BATHTUB CAULK. IT'S JUST -- IT'S A NIGHTMARE. ♪♪ IT TOOK SOME TIME, BUT THE GUYS FINALLY GOT THE NOMAD STRIPPED DOWN AND READY TO BE WORKED ON. WITH THAT NIGHTMARE BEHIND US, IT'S TIME TO MOCK UP THE ENGINE AND SEE WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO CHANGE. - ENGINE DELIVERY. - OH, HECK, YEAH. OH, MAN. WHAT WE GOT THERE? LOOK AT THAT. SUPERCHARGED LSA. AWESOME.THAT'S BADASS. THAT IS. MAN, THESE THINGS GOT LIKE 556 HORSEPOWER OUT OF A 376 CUBIC INCH, FACTORY SUPERCHARGED, AND WE'RE PUTTING A SIX-SPEED BEHIND IT. OH, MAN. IT'S GONNA BE BADASS. THIS GUY'S GONNA HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. WELL, LET'S GET IT IN THERE. Paul: ONE THING THAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THESE SUPERCHARGERS -- THEY MAKE A REAL LOW BOOST RIGHT FROM THE FACTORY, BUT STILL MAKE 556 HORSEPOWER. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT IS, THEY GOT A HEAT EXCHANGER, LIKE, A WATER-TO-AIR INTERCOOLER SET UP, SO IT COOLS THE INTAKE CHARGE AS THE CHARGE IS FORCED DOWN IN THE ENGINE. THIS THING'S GONNA ROCK. ♪♪ THERE IT IS. AND DONE. LET'S SEE WHERE WE'RE AT, HUH? WE'RE ALSO CHANGING THIS CAR FROM AN AUTOMATIC TO A MANUAL SIX-SPEED. WE'RE GONNA INSTALL A MAGNUM T56. IT'S SUPER-STRONG, SUPER-AWESOME, AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH ROLLING THROUGH THE GEARS AS FAST AS WE WANT. LOOK AT THAT. OH, YEAH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CLEARANCE ISSUE THERE WHEN THE TRANNY'S BOLTED UP. LET'S GET THAT CLEARANCED... ALL RIGHT. ...TRY TO MAKE SOME MORE ROOM FOR WHAT WE GOT TO DO HERE. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT. GOOD. THAT LOOKS GOOD. LET'S SET HER DOWN, AND LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT. LOOKS LIKE WE DID GOOD. NOW WE JUST GOT TO MAKE THE TRANNY TO IT, FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE GONNA CUT THE HOLE. YOU READY? YEAH. "CAUTION -- DO NOT LET DOUG WORK ON IT." [ LAUGHS ] THE SIX-SPEED WE'RE PUTTING IN THE '57 NOMAD IS A MAGNUM T56, WHICH IS STRONGER THAN YOUR STANDARD T56. IT HAS STEEL SHIFT FORKS, HARDENED KEYS, BRONZE PADS -- ALL THE STUFF THAT NORMALLY BREAKS WHEN YOU OVERPOWER THEM. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S PERFECT. HEY, MAN, WE'RE A GOOD TEAM. WE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES WE LEARNED FROM. Shh. WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL PEOPLE THAT. RIGHT. ♪♪ Dan: ON THE B PILLAR ON THE NOMAD, WE NOTICED AN ISSUE WITH THE PAINT BEFORE WE EVEN STARTED STRIPPING IT, SO WE GRINDED THIS DOWN TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND THERE'S SOME METAL THAT'S ACTUALLY MISSING FROM THE CORNER OF THE B PILLAR HERE AND ALSO SOME RUST THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE OLD LEAD. SO BEFORE I CAN DO ANY WELDING OR REPAIRS, I GOT TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THE WAY. I'M GONNA BURN THE LEAD OUT WITH A TORCH, AND THEN WE'LL GO FROM THERE. ♪♪ I ALWAYS STRIP ALL THE OLD LEAD OUT OF THE CARS. IT'S -- YOU HAVE TO, OR YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO PAINT PROBLEMS LATER. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL NOT STRIP THIS OLD LEAD OUT, AND WHAT HAPPENS IS, MOISTURE WILL GET INTO THIS SEAM FROM THE BACK SIDE, AND IT WILL START TO SURFACE-RUST. AND IF YOU PAINT OVER THAT, IT SOMETIMES DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE YOU'LL GET BUBBLES IN YOUR PAINT FROM THE RUST. ♪♪ UGH. SO, I FOUND ANOTHER CRACK UP HERE AT THE TOP OF THE B PILLAR. AFTER GRINDING THE PAINT OFF, FOUND OUT IT'S, AGAIN, RUST UNDERNEATH THE LEAD, SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND BURN ALL THIS LEAD OUT, TOO, AND THEN CLEAN THE RUST UP, BODYWORK OVER THAT. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ALL RIGHT, GUYS. THANKS FOR COMING IN. Noah: MY CLIENT DAVE IS DROPPING BY TO TALK ABOUT HIS 1967 MUSTANG THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A WHILE. TODAY, HE'S BRINGING SON OLIVER IN FOR THE FIRST TIME 'CAUSE THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT A FEW NEW IDEAS THEY HAVE TO FINISH UP THE PROJECT. YOU AS INTO THESE CARS AS YOUR DAD IS, OR... JUST A LITTLE BIT. Dave: MY DAD WAS A GEARHEAD. IN A SENSE, I'M PASSING ON THE TRADITION THAT MY DAD GAVE TO ME.AWESOME. I COULD DRIVE A STICK BY THE TIME I WAS 11. THAT'S JUST WHO I AM. CARS ARE IN ME. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN REALLY DO TO CHANGE THAT. WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECENTLY PICK UP OH, VERY NICE. AND WHEN WE BROUGHT THE NEW CAR TO THE HOUSE, WE LITERALLY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SAID, "HOW COOL WOULD IT BE TO TURN THIS INTO A '67 SHELBY GT350?" SO, WE'VE GOT SOME REALLY COOL SHELBY PARTS FOR THE OUTSIDE. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THE INSIDE JUST TO KIND OF ROUND THIS PROJECT OUT? YEAH. I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME PROPER LOGOING ON THE STEERING WHEEL. I THINK, FOR '67, THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE DASH. IT'S PRETTY CLOSE RIGHT NOW.RIGHT. AND MAYBE MAKE SURE THE SEATS LOOK OF THAT SHELBY VINTAGE IN 1967. SURE. SURE. I'LL DO SOME MORE RESEARCH ON THE INTERIOR AND SEE HOW CLOSE WE CAN GET IT JUST TO KIND OF GET THOSE LAST LITTLE DETAILS, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. AWESOME. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A KILLER CAR, BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE THING TO DECIDE. I NEED YOU TO DOUBLE-CHECK THESE COLORS AGAINST YOUR CURRENT CAR. PICK WHAT YOU THINK WILL LOOK BEST. I THINK THE CLASSIC ONE WITH THE WHITE... YEAH....WOULD LOOK REALLY GOOD. THAT'S SUCH AN ICONIC FORD COLOR. I THINK THIS BLUE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PERIOD-CORRECT. I MEAN, THE THING THAT STARTED ALL OF THIS IS THE IDEA OF, HOW COOL WOULD IT BE TO PULL THE '67 MUSTANG RIGHT NEXT TO THE 2017 SHELBY? AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE ONE PICTURE OF THEM RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. BRINGING THAT TOGETHER IN ONE PICTURE -- I THINK IT TELLS IT ALL. THANKS, NOAH. YEAH. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FINISHED PRODUCT. THANKS, OLIVER. GOOD TO MEET YOU. YEAH. ♪♪ THE GUYS HAVE FINISHED THE BODYWORK ON THE NOMAD. JASON JUST LAID DOWN SOME PRIMER. NOW IT'S TIME TO GET BRYAN STARTED ON WHAT IS GOING TO BE AN EPIC INTERIOR. ♪♪ WHAT'S GOING ON, BRYAN? OH, JUST GETTING SOME ROUGH MEASUREMENTS ON THIS, 'CAUSE I HEARD THIS THING'S GETTING A FULL-LENGTH CONSOLE. I KNOW YOU HAD SOME INFORMATION, BUT JUST FROM MY MEETING WITH THE CUSTOMER, HE WANTED BUCKET SEATS. HE WANTS A FULL CONSOLE, KIND OF LIKE A WATERFALL STYLE. HE'S GOT TWO YOUNG SONS. HE DID WANT SOME WAY TO BE ABLE TO PUT HOCKEY STICKS IN THERE, SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE CENTER CONSOLE, YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INCORPORATE. MAKE A LITTLE CARGO PASS-THROUGH. A LITTLE FALSE DOOR OR SOMETHING. HE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT HE TOLD US THAT ALREADY, BUT IT'D BE COOL TO BE LIKE, "HEY, LOOK, WE STILL GOT ROOM FOR YOUR STUFF." YEAH. LET ME FINISH MY MEASUREMENTS. I'LL GO AHEAD AND GET SOME CARDBOARD AND START CUTTING IT UP AND SEE WHAT WE COME UP WITH. I TRUST YOU. YOU GOT THIS. IT SHOULD TURN OUT PRETTY COOL. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE NEAT, MAN. ♪♪ JUST WENT AHEAD AND CUT SOME ROUGH-CUT CARDBOARD BACK HERE, GIVE ME AN IDEA WHERE THIS BULKHEAD'S GONNA BE. ACTUALLY, THIS IS THE FUN PART, IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO DESIGN, TRY AND MAKE EVERYTHING WORK TOGETHER. USE EVERY LITTLE NOOK AND CRANNY AND SPACE AND TRY AND GET THE CAR TO FLOW. ALSO, A LOT OF THE FUN IS BRINGING SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CAR INTO THE DESIGN. THE CAR IS GOING TO BE MAKING SEVERAL TRIPS TO THE ICE ARENA, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HIDE SOME 5-FOOT HOCKEY STICKS. SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO RIG UP SOME WAY TO MAKE A FALSE DOOR HERE AND MAYBE A FLIP-DOWN PIECE TO GET HOCKEY STICKS THROUGH HERE. I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN TRAINING FOR THIS MY WHOLE LIFE, EVER SINCE KINDERGARTEN. CARDBOARD, CRAYONS. PUT SOME STORAGE IN HERE, SUBWOOFER DOWN HERE. BUT AT LEAST WE GOT A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AND THEN, WITH ANY LUCK, WE'LL BE CUTTING IT OUT. ♪♪ Paul: GOT THE '57 NOMAD HERE. GETTING READY TO UPGRADE THE SUSPENSION ON IT. WE GOT RideTech TUBULAR CONTROL ARMS FOR THE FRONT, A FOUR-LINK FOR THE REAR WITH A 9-INCH FOUR, UPGRADED THIRD MEMBER, AND WE'RE GONNA PUT THESE BRAKES ALL THE WAY AROUND ON IT, SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT FEELING OF A SPORTS CAR, BUT IN A WAGON. THAT'S IT. FRONT SUSPENSION'S ALL WRAPPED UP. HOPE WE HAVE THE SAME KIND OF LUCK WITH THE REAR SUSPENSION. ♪♪ ♪♪ THE HELL? WHAT THE **** THAT MAKES NO SENSE. WELL, DURING THIS MOCK-UP PROCEDURE, WE RAN INTO AN ISSUE WHERE THE COILOVERS ARE ACTUALLY HITTING THE FACTORY SPARE-TIRE WELL. I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A LITTLE TIGHT, BUT I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS GONNA BE THIS TIGHT, SO THE FACTORY SPARE-TIRE WELL HAS TO GO. ALWAYS SOMETHING. ♪♪ INSTALLING THE REAR SUSPENSION ON THE '57 NOMAD, I RAN INTO INTERFERENCE ISSUES WITH THE FACTORY SPARE-TIRE WELL. SO NOW I'M REMOVING IT, AND I'M GONNA FAB UP A NEW TRUNK FLOOR. AWESOME. START TEARING UP SOME **** ♪♪ THERE WE GO. SHE'S OUT. ♪♪ [ RECORD SCRATCHES, SOFT MUSIC PLAYS ] YEAH. JUST... HI, RANDY. JUST LET IT HAPPEN. WOW. LIKE TO HELP ME STOP ON THE SHEAR? YEAH.

YEAH. ♪♪ WOULD BE COOL TO KIND OF PUT THOSE FACTORY GROOVES THAT ARE IN THERE, BUT... THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING. MARK'S ADDING SOME CUSTOM BEAD ROLLS TO THE PANEL I FABRICATED FOR THE '57 NOMAD. IT'S GONNA ADD THAT CLASSIC TOUCH THAT THE '57 NOMAD HAD, AND IT'S ALSO GONNA HAVE THE SMALL DETAILS THAT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO MAKES SURE THEY NAIL ON EVERY PROJECT. THERE YOU GO. THANKS, MARK. ♪♪ AWESOME. NOW THAT I GOT THE TRUNK FLOOR ALL SQUARED AWAY, I'M GONNA TRY FITTING THIS SEDAN FUEL TANK IN HERE. OKAY. I'M READY TO TEST-FIT IT. NOT ONLY IS THIS FUEL TANK GONNA FIT THE CAR BETTER, BUT WE'RE GONNA INSTALL AN 800-HORSEPOWER-CAPABILITY FUEL PUMP. HAS AN INTERNAL REGULATOR IN IT, AND IT ALLOWS US TO ONLY HAVE TO RUN ONE FUEL LINE ALL THE WAY TO THE FRONT. I LIKE IT. NOW I GOT THE BIG BRAKES ALL INSTALLED, WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO INSTALLING THE BIG SWAY BARS. THEY'RE GONNA CONTROL THE BODY ROLL OF THE CAR WHEN YOU GO INTO A TURN. SO, BASICALLY, ANY KIND OF UNSTORED ENERGY IT STARTS TO LOSE ON ONE SIDE OF THE CAR, IT'S GONNA GAIN IT ON THE OTHER AND KEEP THE CAR LEVELED OUT IN THAT TURN AND KEEP ALL FOUR WHEELS PLANTED. ♪♪ LOOKS GOOD TO ME. ♪♪ I'M WORKING ON TURNING THIS BORING MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE INTO A WICKED AWESOME SHELBY MUSTANG. Noah: FOR THE 1967 FORD MUSTANG, THE GUYS FINESSED SOME BODYWORK, ADDED A TAILLIGHT PANEL, AND NOW THEY HAVE THIS SUCKER READY FOR PAINT. ♪♪ ♪♪ WORD UP. MUSTANG IS DONE WITH ALL THE BODYWORK. NOW WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET IT PREPPED UP AND GET IT READY FOR PAINT SO WE CAN GET IT IN THE BOOTH. ♪♪ WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME NICE, CLASSIC WIMBLEDON WHITE ON IT. THEN, AFTER THAT, WE'RE GONNA ADD A NICE RACE-Y BLUE STRIPE TO GIVE THIS CAR A BITCHING COOL LOOK BACK LIKE IT WAS IN 1967. ♪♪ Noah: DESPITE ALL THE ADVANCES IN CAR TECHNOLOGY, ONE THING THAT STILL HAS TO BE DONE BY HAND IS LAYING DOWN STRIPES. THERE ARE NO TRICKS. JUST SKILL AND A TAPE MEASURE. Dan: WE'RE GONNA MARK OUR CENTER LINE, MEASURE OUT FROM THERE, GET OUR GAP IN THE MIDDLE, THEN MEASURE OUT FROM THERE, GET OUR RACING STRIPES. Jason: WE ARE GONNA PAINT THE STRIPES A NICE METALLIC BLUE TO SET OFF THIS WHITE. ♪♪ ♪♪ ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR ON THE '57 NOMAD. THIS IS THE REAR-SEAT CONSOLE. IF YOU CAN PICTURE THE CARGO DECK IN THE CAR, THIS IS LEVEL WITH THE CARGO DECK, SO THIS IS AN EXTENSION. THIS IS WHERE THE HOCKEY STICKS ARE GONNA GO. [ LAUGHS ] WE'RE GONNA COVER ALL THIS IN LEATHER, FLOWING THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. WE'RE GONNA INCORPORATE SCOTT'S STYLE OF BEAD ROLLING IN THE SIDE OF THE UPHOLSTERY. WE MAY EVEN CARRY IT OVER INTO THE DOOR PANEL AS A THEME THROUGHOUT THE CAR, 'CAUSE THE CUSTOMER ACTUALLY REQUESTED IT. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA USE STEEL. WE'RE GONNA USE ABS AND PVC. THIS IS IMITATION BEAD ROLL. SCOTT'S LITTLE SAYING -- "IF IT AIN'T STEEL, IT AIN'T REAL," BUT THIS'LL BE JUST AS REAL, AND IT WON'T RUST. ♪♪ ♪♪ OKAY, WE HAVE THE NOMAD CONSOLE KIND OF MOCKED UP ON THE TABLE. THE ONLY THING REALLY LEFT STRUCTURAL THAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO DESIGN THE DECK, AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND COVER IT UP. THIS IS THE PIECE THAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE IN THE CENTER OF THE CONSOLE. AND ONCE THEY GET THIS PLASTIC UP ABOVE A PARTICULAR TEMPERATURE, IT WILL START TO BEND, AND THEN WHEN YOU BRING IT BACK DOWN TO TEMPERATURE, IT'LL STAY. IT'LL HOLD THAT SHAPE. SO, IT'S FLEXIBLE RIGHT NOW, BUT IN A SECOND, IT WON'T BE. NOW, ONCE WE'VE GOT IT TO THE DESIRED ANGLE, I'LL JUST COOL IT DOWN. RIGHT ON. ♪♪ WE JUST GOT THE REAR SUSPENSION ALL INSTALLED AND ALL PAINTED, AND NOW IT'S TIME TO FIT UP SOME BRAKES. WE'RE ASSEMBLING THESE HUGE DISC BRAKES FOR THE '57 NOMAD.

AND WE'LL PUT SOME FIBERGLASS RESIN AND SOME MAT OVER TOP OF THAT, AND THEN WE'LL MAKE THIS LITTLE WATERFALL FEATURE FOR THE GUY. GREAT THING ABOUT FIBERGLASS IS THAT YOU CAN MOLD IT IN ANY SHAPE YOU WANT, AND IT'S REALLY STRONG WHEN YOU PUT IT TOGETHER RIGHT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IT CAN BE A REAL BITCH TO WORK WITH. ♪♪ SINCE THE CLIENT IN THE '57 CHEVY HAS TWO YOUNG KIDS BOUNCING AROUND, WE'RE GONNA ADD TWO MORE LAYERS OF FIBERGLASS TO THE SEAT SURROUND, AND WE'RE GONNA USE A MORE EXPENSIVE AND A LITTLE MORE DURABLE FOAM SO IT CAN TAKE A LITTLE MORE ABUSE. THE CUSTOMER'S REQUESTED THAT WE MAKE A PASS-THROUGH IN THIS BULKHEAD TO ALLOW HIM TO PUT HIS SONS' HOCKEY STICKS IN, SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE A COMPLETE TUNNEL AND BE ABLE TO PASS THOSE 5-FOOT HOCKEY STICKS RIGHT ON THROUGH.

THIS IS YOUR TYPICAL LSA SUPERCHARGER THAT WOULD BE, LIKE, IN THE CTS-V CADILLAC. HOWEVER, A ZL1 CAMARO HAS THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS AS THIS, BUT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT LID THAT GOES ON IT. SO, THE HEAT EXCHANGER BASICALLY HAS AN AREA IN THE UPPER INTAKE OF THE SUPERCHARGER THAT WATER GETS TRANSFERRED FROM A WATER-TO-AIR INTERCOOLER. WHAT THAT DOES IS, IT GETS YOUR INTAKE-AIR TEMPS DOWN, AND THAT ALLOWS IT TO BUILD MORE POWER. ♪♪ THEY SHOULD BE SO HAPPY WITH THIS. OH, I HOPE SO. IF NOT, I'LL TAKE IT.
