 HERE AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO, MY TEAM OF VISIONARIES AND MASTER CRAFTSMEN TAKE CARS OF ALL KINDS AND TRANSFORM THEM INTO CUSTOM TAILORED HIGH PERFORMANCE RIDES. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS AND HAUL ASS? WE'RE THE SHOP FOR YOU. BECAUSE HERE, SPEED IS THE NEW BLACK. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ** SO I'M MEETING WITH CHARLIE TODAY, WHO DRIVES LIKE A WILD MAN, LIVES FAST, AND HE'S BRINGING IN A '57 CHEVY BEL AIR. THINGS SHOULD GET INTERESTING. WHAT'S GOING ON, CHARLIE? HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? DOING DAMN GOOD. GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO. TELL ME ABOUT THE CAR. WE BOUGHT IT FROM A CAR GALLERY DOWN THE STREET HERE IN ST. LOUIS. WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT HAD HERITAGE TO IT. A PERSON ACTUALLY CRAFTED IT WITH THEIR HANDS. IT'S GOT THIS DESIGN, THIS POWER BEHIND IT THAT YOU KIND OF LOSE WITH NEWER AUTOMOBILES. LOOKS LIKE A NICE NEW ORIGINAL CAR. I THINK WE'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD STARTING POINT. THE '57 CHEVY IS AN ICONIC CAR. ITS ALWAYS BEEN VERY POPULAR SINCE THEY WERE RELEASED. A LOT OF CUSTOMS, A LOT OF ORIGINALS. PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE THINGS. THESE CARS HAVE BEEN EVERYTHING FROM FAMILY CARS, TO DRAGSTERS. SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DO WITH THE CAR? WHAT KIND OF DIRECTION DO YOU WANT TO TAKE IT IN? WHAT DON'T WE WANT TO DO WITH IT? I LIKE WHERE WE'RE GOING! THE CAR IS BLACK. ALL THE CARS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COLLECTION... IT'S GOT TO BE BLACK. ALL BLACK EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING IS BLACK. WE DO HAVE A LITTLE GOLD FLAVOR GOING ON HERE THOUGH. GOLD IS KEY. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE GOLD. SO WHAT IF WE PAINTED THE ENTIRE THING IN GOLD? I THINK WE NEED TO LOAD IT BACK UP ON THE TRAILER AND LEAVE. ALL RIGHT. FROM AN EXTERIOR STANDPOINT, WHEN YOU WALK UP TO THIS CAR, IT'S GOT TO FLASH. I WANT TO SEE LENS FLARES WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THIS THING. SO IN TERMS OF OVERALL STYLING, I KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THE MOST PART. IT'S GOT ALL THE BEAUTY. IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A CLASSIC CAR, BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE. AND HOW IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO DRIVE? I WANT TO DRIVE LIKE I'M HAULING ASS ALL THE TIME. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ENGINE. YES. I KIND OF WANT TO SCARE THE **** OUT OF YOU. OLD SCHOOL, SMALL BLOCK. MAKES THEM HIGH HORSEPOWER. THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE BEING SCARED. RIGHT. NEEDS TO BE AUTOMATIC BECAUSE I NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON MY WIFE THAN ACTUALLY SHIFTING GEARS. YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP HER HAPPY. I'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HER. I LIKE WHERE YOU'RE GOING THERE. IT NEEDS TO BE FUN AND AGGRESSIVE, AND KIND OF THAT THROWBACK. YET IT NEEDS TO HAVE ENOUGH MODERN TOUCHES. I THINK WE CAN LOWER THIS THING DOWN TO THE GROUND AND GIVE IT A BADASS STANCE. I'VE GOT A COUPLE GOOD IDEAS FOR WHEEL AND TIRE PACKAGES THAT I THINK IS GOING TO REALLY MAKE THIS THING POP. OKAY. IT'LL GIVE YOU SOME CRAZY SPEED AND WAY BETTER PERFORMANCE. A LOT BETTER SUSPENSION, AND I THINK WE CAN DO SOME WORK ON THE STYLING WITHOUT KILLING IT TOO MUCH. IT'LL BE A TIRE BURNING HOT ROD. IT'S GOING TO BE A BADASS. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THE DIRECTION WE TAKE IT IN. NOTHING MATTERS EXCEPT FOR THE MOMENT THAT YOU'RE IN RIGHT THERE, AND HOW HARD YOU PUSH DOWN ON THAT GAS PEDAL. THANKS FOR COMING IN. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SIR. BYE-BYE BABY. LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING ON IT. ** A '57 CHEVY. THIS RIGHT HERE ****. THIS RIGHT HERE IS AMERICA'S HOT ROD. THERE YOU GO. SO I KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DO SOME CUSTOM **** TO THIS. SO AFTER I MEET WITH THE CLIENT, I TYPICALLY LIKE TO MEET WITH CHARLES OR GM AND SCOTT, MY LEAD FABRICATOR, COME UP WITH A GOOD PLAN TOGETHER. YOU TALKED TO THE OWNER. YEAH, WHAT DOES HE WANT? POWER STEERING, POWER BRAKES, BIG BRAKES. HE WANTS AIR CONDITIONING, WE'LL GIVE HIM THAT. ALL RIGHT. HE WANTS SOMETHING THAT HE'S GOING TO DRIVE EVERYWHERE. HE'LL DRIVE IT EVERY DAMN DAY. HE LIKES THE ORIGINAL '57 CHEVY LOOK. HE DRIVES AROUND LIKE A FREAKING MANIAC, A NUT. AND HE KEEPS BLOWING UP MOTORS. HE'S BEEN THROUGH I THINK THREE ENGINES, AND TWO TRANSMISSIONS. I WANT TO HEAR YOUR FIRST BAD IDEA. '57 CHEVY WITH A CANDY LACE MEXICAN ROOF DANGLE BERRIES. TURN IT INTO A HOPPER. DAYTON WIRE WHEELS. DAYTONS? HOW BIG OF A BURRITO DID YOU EAT FOR LUNCH? HE DID SAY HE LIKES GOLD. I THINK WE DO PROBABLY GOLD WHEELS. GOLD ENGINE? GOLD ENGINE? THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC CLASSIC CARS EVER BUILT. SO YOU CAN'T REALLY GO WRONG WITH THE '57 CHEVY BEL AIR. THE HURDLE BECOMES, HOW DO WE MAKE THIS CAR DIFFERENT? AND NOT LOOK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE'S '57 CHEVY? I THINK WE BUILT THEM QUASI PRO TOURING CAR. YOU DRIVE IT ALL OVER THE PLACE. OVERDRIVE TRANSMISSION, BADASS REAR END. MAKE IT JUST SO THAT HE CAN'T BREAK IT. WE'LL GET HIM A CRATE MOTOR WITH A WARRANTY, WITH HIGH HORSEPOWER. SOMETHING THAT HE COULD THRASH. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO A 383 STROKER, OVER 500 HORSEPOWER, AN OVERDRIVE TRANSMISSION, AND A FABRICATED 9-INCH REAR END. THIS THING IS GOING TO BE FREAKING STOUT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SUSPENSION. CAN WE HAMMER IT SOMEHOW? HAMMER IT DOWN. LET'S HAMMER IT DOWN LIKE ROUND. WHAT KIND OF WHEELS? BIG WHEELS? LITTLE WHEELS? 18" WHEELS? LIKE MAGNESIUM STYLE. YOU KNOW, WITH MODERN STYLING BUT WITH THE YESTERDAY'S TECHNOLOGY OF THE DAHL 7 MAGNESIUM STYLE WHEEL. I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY BITCH. WE'RE GOING INTERIOR? WELL AT THE MOMENT HE'S GOT SHIPPING BLANKET AND NO REAR SEAT. IT LOOKS LIKE RATS HAVE BEEN LIVING BACK THERE. HE WANTS A CLASSIC STYLE INTERIOR. STOCK INTERIOR? SO WE NEED TO RECREATE THE INTERIOR IN THIS CAR SO IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT DID IN 1957. TIME CAPSULE. ALL BRAND NEW. ALL STOCK. ALL STOCK. WE SHOULD ALSO PROBABLY UPGRADE THE SOUND SYSTEM WITH SOME NEW MODERN COMPONENTS. YES. A PROBLEM WITH THAT TOO? STOP SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD. WHY ARE YOU SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD? ARE YOU NERVOUS? GOT LICE? YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG? I'M GETTING READY TO FREAK OUT. YOU GUYS ARE GETTING IN MY BUBBLE. I THINK WE CAN GIVE IT A UNIQUE LOOK. IT'LL FINE. IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD CAR. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. COME ON. GET HIM. GET HIM. UNH! [ LAUGHING ] ** ALL RIGHT, SO HOW ARE WE DOING? SEATBELT'S OUT, CARPETING, AND THAT REAR PACKAGE TRAY. CHARLIE WANTS AN ORIGINAL LOOKING INTERIOR BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE GOING TO KEEP WHAT'S IN THERE. SO WE'RE GOING TO TEAR IT DOWN AND START WITH A CLEAN SLATE. '57 OE FLOOR PANS. THAT'S SOME GOOD ASS VELCRO. THAT'S SOME CUSTOM ****. THERE WE GO. AND LOOKS LIKE SOME OLD UNDIES OR SOMETHING DOWN THERE. YEAH, WHO KNOWS? THAT MIGHT BE GRANNY PANTIES. LOOK AT THESE ANCIENT GRILLS, MAN. COME ON MAN, PULL THOSE GRANNY PANTIES OUT. TOLD YOU I WASN'T TOUCHING THOSE. COME ON, YOU'LL TOUCH THEM. NOPE. AAH! HEY, DUSTIN. THERE'S YOUR GRANNY PANTIES. AAH! AN OLD T-SHIRT, LOOKS LIKE. I HOPE. LOOK AT THAT. A MOUSE HOUSE. - THERE'S A DEAD ONE. - OH, MAN. I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT. WHEN WE'RE TEARING DOWN A CAR, WE USUALLY EXPECT TO FIND SOME NASTY OLD FOAM, BAD WIRING, JUST STUFF THAT'S KIND OF DETERIORATING. WHAT WE DON'T EXPECT TO FIND ARE DEAD RODENTS AND OLD GRANNY PANTIES. I HOPE THIS ISN'T A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME. I BETTER NOT. THIS IS A CUSTOMER'S CAR. IT AIN'T OUR CAR. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT CAME WITH IT, MAN. IT'S HIS DEAD RAT, NOT YOURS. WELL, HERE. ** WHAT'S UP? GOT A BIG BOX FOR YOU. THIS IS CHARLIE'S NEW ENGINE. SO CHARLIE'S ENGINE JUST CAME IN. IT'S A RIP ROARING 383 STROKER. COMES WITH A WARRANTY, WHICH IS GOOD FOR HIM. WE'RE GOING TO PUT THIS SUCKER IN AND SEE HOW IT RUNS. THIS IS GOING TO BE PRETTY GOOD. 383 STROKER, PROBABLY GOT 450 HORSEPOWER, I'M THINKING. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE PERFECT BALANCE OF POWER AND RELIABILITY FOR THE GUY WHO HAS A HORRIBLE HISTORY FOR BLOWING UP MOTORS. FIRST WE'VE GOT TO PAINT IT GOLD. PAINT IT GOLD? HE WANTS EVERYTHING GOLD. I FIGURED WE CAN DO THE ENGINE GOLD. THAT'S AN EASY ONE. WHEN CHARLIE POPS OPEN THAT HOOD, I WANT A SEA OF BLACK WITH A BIG HUNK OF GOLD IN THE MIDDLE. IF CHARLIE WANTS MORE GOLD ON HIS CAR, WE'RE GIVING CHARLIE MORE GOLD. IT'LL LOOK GOOD. BLACK ENGINE COMPARTMENT, GLOWING GOLD ENGINE. HE'LL LOVE IT. LET'S GET THE ENGINE STAND. GET THIS THING LOADED UP, SENT OVER TO JASON. ** WE HAVE A FACTORY SEAT FOR A 1957 CHEVY. WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF FRIENDS IN HERE. MICE OVER HERE MADE A LITTLE CONDO. THIS COULD PROBABLY BE THE LAST PERSON THAT WAS IN THE TRUNK. OH, MY GOD. YOU GOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME? NO. I'M PRETTY SURE THIS THING COULD QUALIFY AS A BIO-HAZARD. WE'LL GET RID OF ALL THIS STUFF THAT'S CORRODED OR JUST NASTY SMELLING. THE SPRINGS ARE STILL IN TACT. I'LL GO AHEAD AND PUT SOME NEW FOAM ON IT. PUT SOME FOAM OVER THE TOP. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. THE BIGGEST THING WITH THIS INTERIOR IS A RETRO LOOK, LIKE A TIME CAPSULE INTERIOR. ALL NEW STUFF OF COURSE. OKAY. IF YOU FEEL YOURSELF START ITCHING, WE KNOW WHY. STAY AWAY FROM ME. IT'S GOT FLEAS? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET FLEAS AGAIN. OH, NO. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. IT'S LIKE A BOWL OF CEREAL IN HERE, MAN. CAP'N CRUNCH. THIS IS FOAM. NO SPRING LEFT IN THAT. [LAUGHS] SO WE'LL GET RID OF ALL THIS OTHER STUFF, CLEAN IT UP. WE'LL ADD SOME NEW FOAM, AND THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF YOUR NEW CAR SMELL, WHICH WOULD BE THE FOAM. JUST USE THIS LAYER HERE TO KIND OF COVER THE SPRINGS. KEEP IT FROM DIGGING INTO THE REAL FOAM. THIS IS MORE OF THE FOAM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE SITTING ON. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A TOP LAYER WHICH WILL TAKE ALL THE HARD EDGES OFF THE FOAM UNDERNEATH AND GIVE YOU MORE OF YOUR SHAPE. REAL CLOSE TO WHAT THEY HAD BACK IN 1957. IT'S GOING TO BE SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT THE MOUSE POO IN IT. ** SO GUESS WHY WE'RE HERE? WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A TRIUMPH. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO FINISH THIS CAR. OH WE ARE? SO THE '69 CAMARO HAS A PRETTY INTERESTING STORY. I HAD THIS CLIENT FROM EASTERN EUROPE. I'VE NEVER MET THE CLIENT IN PERSON. I'VE NEVER TALKED TO HIM ON THE PHONE. IT'S ALL EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE. HE ORDERED THE CAR, I INSPECTED IT OUT FOR HIM, I SENT HIM PICTURES, HE SENDS PAYMENT, AND THEN WE'RE ALMOST DONE WITH THE CAR, HE DISAPPEARS OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. SO COULD YOU BELIEVE AFTER AN ENTIRE YEAR, THIS GUY SHOWS BACK UP, HE SENT ME ALL THESE PICTURES OF BENTLEY INTERIORS. SO ALTHOUGH THIS IS A WILD PRO TOURING CAR, IT ALSO HAS TO BE VERY VERY LUXURIOUS. AND HE WANTS THE CAR IN SIX WEEKS. SIX WEEKS? WE'VE GOT SIX WEEKS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CAR FOR YEARS. BUT THIS CAMARO STILL NEEDS THE ENGINE PUT IN. IT NEEDS ALL THE INTERIOR DONE. IT NEEDS THE GLASS PUT IN, PLUMBING, EVERYTHING. YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS NO QUALITY, YOU KNOW. THE WHOLE THING IS ALL ABOUT QUALITY. AND SIX WEEKS IS GOING TO CRUNCH ON IT BUT... WHAT DID HE SAY WHEN HE WAS ON THE PHONE? I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE GUY ON THE PHONE, EVER. I MEAN I DON'T CARE IF THE GUY COMES IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE. HOW DID YOU GET SIX WEEKS? YEAH, HOW'D YOU GET THAT? HE SENT ME AN EMAIL. IT'S ALL EMAILS. HE'S JUST PUSHING US TO GET IT DONE FASTER. HERE'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO. SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE EXTERIOR AS IS, BUT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, WAY TOO DULL. I WANT TO GO WITH A SEMI-GLOSS AND A METALLIC UNDERNEATH THAT. TO GIVE THIS CLIENT THE POWER THAT HE WANTS, I DECIDED ON A SHAFIROFF RACING 540 CUBIC INCH BIG BLOCK MOTOR THAT DELIVERS 625 HORSEPOWER WITH A CUSTOM BUILT TURBO 400 TRANSMISSION. WE'LL MAKE THE WHOLE ENGINE COMPARTMENT POP. THAT'S A LITTLE MORE UP TO DATE. IT'S WAY MORE UP TO DATE. THE CAR IS PRETTY CUTTING EDGE, WHICH IS GOOD. THE INTERIOR, WE HAD A GOOD PLAN. SO, THE INTERIOR NEEDS TO BE SLEEK, LUXURIOUS, AND HE WANTS IT ORANGE, LIKE KIND OF THE COLOR OF A BASKETBALL. PAUL'S GOING TO HAVE TO WIRE THE WHOLE CARE STILL. BEYOND THAT, WE'LL ADD SOME SERIOUS TEST DRIVE TIME IN IT, BUT ONCE WE GET EVERYTHING SET UP AGAIN, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A NICE CAR. WE ONLY GOT SIX WEEKS. I BETTER GO START FINDING THE PARTS NOW. YEAH. GO DIG. GET AFTER IT. ** PURE AMERICAN BALL IS GOING TO BE FLOATING AROUND RUSSIA. WE'RE GOING TO DROP THIS BIG BLOCK INTO THIS CHASSIS HERE. YEAH, THIS BAD BOY... SHOULD REALLY RUN THIS THING. THE GUY FROM RUSSIA, HE WANTED REAL AMERICAN HORSEPOWER, SO WHAT WE OPTED TO GO WITH WAS A SHAFIROFF RACING 540 CUBIC INCH BIG BLOCK. THIS THING IS GOING TO BE EATING THE **** OUT OF THE TIRES. THERE'S MINE. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, MAN. RIGHT ON THE MONEY. THAT OKAY THERE? NO SCRATCHES HERE. NONE OVER HERE EITHER. BUT WE AIN'T DONE YET. THE TRANNY WE'RE INSTALLING HERE IS A TURBO 400. SHE'S A GOOD ONE. YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE WITHOUT NO DRIVE SHAFT. SEXY. THEY ACTUALLY FIT. BOOYAH. THAT LOOKS GOOD. IT'S KIND OF A SELF-PRIDE THING FOR ME IS TO HIDE AS MUCH AS I CAN HIDE WHEN YOU POP THE HOOD TO LOOK AT THE MOTOR. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE IS THE MOTOR, NOT ALL THE BULL **** THAT MAKES THE MOTOR RUN. I TRY TO TAKE MY TIME AND ROUTE EVERYTHING THROUGH THE INTAKE OR THROUGH THE FRAME OR MAKE LITTLE BRACKETS AND RUN **** UNDERNEATH THE HEADERS. ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO GET THE STUFF OUT OF YOUR EYE, MAKES YOUR PROJECT A WHOLE LOT BETTER LOOKING WHEN IT'S DONE. OH, MAN, THIS THING'S HEAVY. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS GET THAT REMOTE START, FILL THE CARBURETOR UP WITH GAS AND HOPEFULLY SHE COMES TO LIFE. CARB CLEAR ALWAYS HELPS JUST A HAIR. ALL RIGHT, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. [ MOTOR CRANKS ] DO IT AGAIN. DO IT AGAIN. [ ENGINE CRANKS ] ALL RIGHT. NO ONE WANTS TO FEEL IT SHAKING HERE. I FELT IT SHAKE MY OFFICE. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. RUSSIA DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING FOR THEM. THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN LET THIS CAR IN. DO YOU KNOW THAT THE TARIFF FOR THIS ENGINE SIZE TO GET IT INTO THAT COUNTRY IS $54,000? REALLY? YES. JUST BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE BIG DISPLACEMENT, THEY WANT 54 GRAND? GONNA SPANK HIM, THEN SNAP HIM WITH THE WETTEST TOWEL. IT'S NOT PRETTY, BUT SOUNDS GOOD. SO GOOD JOB. YUP. CONTINUE ON. ** WE'VE GOT CHARLIE'S 383 STROKER HERE, GETTING READY TO DO SOME PREP ON IT AND GET IT IN THE BOOTH. WE'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE GOLD ON IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CHARLIE LOVES GOLD. SO LET'S GO GET IT IN THE BOOTH AND START PREPPING IT UP. JUST GOT DONE PUTTING ON AN EPOXY PRIMER. THE REASON WHY WE PUT THE EPOXY PRIMER ON IT, IS SO IT CAN HOLD THE HEAT AND STILL STAY SHINY AND GLOSS LIKE THE REST OF THE CAR LOOKS. IF YOU EVER ARE PAINTING AN ENGINE, YOU WANT TO USE EPOXY. EPOXY IS JUST WHAT BITES INTO THE METAL. PLUS, IT ALSO HOLDS AND TAKES THE HEAT VERY VERY WELL. THIS IS A GOLD THAT I'M GOING TO PUT DOWN THAT I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THAT I ACTUALLY HOPE THAT CHARLIE DIGS TOO BECAUSE IT KIND OF GOES WITH THE REST OF THE GOLD THAT HE HAS ON HIS CAR. NOW THAT'S A GOOD LOOKING GOLD NOW. ** CHARLIE IS GOING TO DRIVE THE CRAP OUT OF THIS CAR, SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WE PUT IN, PARTS AND QUALITY AND LABOR'S ALL GOT TO BE TOP NOTCH, OR HE'S GOING TO BREAK IT. AH, DAMN, SEE, THIS IS WHAT I SAY, MAN. YUP. THIS THING'S ALREADY BEEN MODIFIED LIKE A MOTHER ****. BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAD A COILOVER SUSPENSION AND A 4-LINK SETUP, THEY HAD ALREADY PUT LIKE MORE OF A PRO STREET STYLE FRAME, BRACKETS, AND CROSSMEMBERS IN HERE. SO WE GOT TO CUT OUR FRAME BACK DOWN TO A STOCK LOOKING FRAME AND GET RID OF THE CROSSMEMBERS THAT ARE IN THERE BEFORE WE CAN PUT OUR NEW KIT IN. IF THE GUY HAD A SQUEAK COMPLAINT, I THINK I FOUND IT. THE NEW SETUP'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE CUTTING OUT. WHAT WE'RE CUTTING OUT WAS MORE LIKE A OLD STYLE, OLD TECHNOLOGY. EVERYTHING NOWADAYS IS A LITTLE LIGHTER, BUT STILL STRONGER. ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT ALL THE CROSSMEMBERS AND ALL THE BRACKETS ON TO THE FRAME. NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT OUR LINK BARS AND SETUP THE GEOMETRY. LET'S THROW IT ON HERE AND ROCK 'N ROLL. ALL RIGHT. ** THINKING WE'RE RIGHT ON SCHEDULE, WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS CAR ON ITS FEET AND GET IT OUT OF HERE, AND THEN BAM. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. WE'RE COMPLETELY ****. ** WE'RE COMPLETELY **** WITH THIS REAR END. YOU SEE HOW THE COILOVERS ARE HITTING THAT BRACKET ON THE BACK? OH, YEAH. OUR BUILT-IN 4-LINK IS GREAT. IT WOULD HOLD A STOCK REAR END RIGHT IN PLACE JUST PERFECT. BUT WITH THE BIG REINFORCEMENTS GOING ACROSS THE BACK, THERE'S NO WAY TO PUT THE COILOVERS WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. SO DO WE MODIFY THE UPPER BRACKETS AND PUT THEM FORWARD? OR DO WE MODIFY THE REAR END? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. YOU SEE THAT BIG BRACE ALL THE WAY ACROSS? FACTORY REAR END WON'T HAVE THAT. YOU'RE AT 9 AND 3/4? I'M AT 8 AND 3/4. BOTTOM LINE IS, WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THE REAR END BACK OUT, WE'VE GOT TO DO SOME MODIFYING TO THE BRACKETS TO THE REAR END, DO SOME CUTTING. WE'LL COME BACK AT IT AGAIN. GRIND SOME OF THAT OFF, CLEAN IT UP, PUT A **** CAP ON IT, BAM BAM. AND ONCE THE SHOCKS ARE HERE, IT'LL LOOK LIKE IT WAS ALL MADE TO BE. OH, YEAH. THAT'LL LOOK WICKED. SIMPLEST WAY I COULD THINK OF. ** SO WE'VE GOT THE BACK BRACE HERE NOTCHED OUT FOR THE SHOCK CLEARANCE. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THESE INBOARD A LITTLE BIT HERE. AND THEN I'LL GET THESE TACKED UP ON THE AXLE HOUSING AND THEN GET IT UP IN THE CAR. GET IT ALL CENTERED RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE IS REALLY CLOSE, AS LONG AS WE'RE CENTERED. ALL RIGHT, ALL THE MEASUREMENTS ARE GOOD. WE'VE GOT OUR THINGS ALL TACKED ON, WE'RE GOING TO DROP IT OUT, TAKE IT TO THE BENCH, BURN THEM IN GOOD, THROW IT BACK IN AFTER WE GET IT PAINTED. WE'RE DONE. THERE IT IS. HOT, SWEET, AND STICKY. SO WHEN YOU BUILD A 383 STROKER ENGINE, YOU GET EXTRA DISPLACEMENT BY INCREASING THE STROKE. SO YOU TAKE A 350 BLOCK AND A 400 CRANK, AND BOOM. MORE CUBIC INCHES. AND WITH MORE CUBIC INCHES COMES MORE GAS, AND MORE AIR, AND THEREFORE MORE POWER. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT IN SIDEWAYS, WE HOPE, CLEAR EVERYTHING, THEN WE'LL TWIST IT STRAIGHT. IF WE CAN GET IT IN BELOW THE... NOW WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE MASTER CYLINDER. CLEAR? YUP. HERE IT GOES. COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT. LITTLE BIT MORE. WANT MORE? WHOA! WHOA! WHAT? WHAT, WHAT, WHAT? JUST GETTING TIGHT. LET'S REEVALUATE FOR A SECOND. WE ALMOST NEED SOMEONE ELSE TO LIFT THE CHERRY PICKER. THEN I CAN HOLD UP AND TILT IT. YEAH WE DO. WE NEED SOME HELP. ERIC! CAN YOU HELP US REAL QUICK? YOU ROCK. WHAT'S HAPPENING, GENTS? OH. GUYS GOT YOURSELVES IN A LITTLE HOLE. BETTER NOT SCRATCH ANYTHING, ERIC. WE'RE SO CLOSE. LIFT UP MORE. I COULD ACTUALLY HELP IF YOU GUYS... DO YOU WANT HELP? CAN YOU PUSH IT BACK JUST A FUZZ? IT'S JUST... GENTLE. THIS THIS HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN. PERFECTO! PERFECTO! LET HER DOWN JUST REAL SLOW. WE'RE PAST OUR OBSTACLE. WE'RE PUTTING A CHEVY SMALL BLOCK INTO A RATHER LARGE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. WE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING ANY ISSUES, BUT WE ARE FIGHTING THIS THING LEFT AND RIGHT. MAYBE IF YOU LOWERED THE TRANNY A HAIR. ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT UP JUST A HALF A PUMP OR SO. IT NEEDS TO SLIDE OVER DOWN THIS WAY. READY? YEAH, A LITTLE BIT... - GETTING CLOSER. - THERE IT IS. THERE IT WENT. THERE YOU GO, I JUST PRIED ON THIS UP HERE. THIS SIDE SLID ON MORE. ONE IN. GOOD JOB, ERIC. TWO IN. FINALLY. BYE, FELICIA! ALL RIGHT, WE GOT IT IN. LOOKS GOOD GUYS. IT ONLY TOOK SEVEN GUYS AND FOURTEEN HOURS. THIS ONE'S A BITCH. WITHOUT ERIC'S LITTLE NIMBLE HANDS WE WOULD HAVE NEVER PROBABLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. ERIC, YOU GET TO DO THE HONORS. GRAB THOSE DICE FOR ME, DUSTIN. THESE DICE? THOSE ARE THE ONES. FUZZY DICE MIGHT BELONG IN SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR, BUT IN THE CARS WE DO, HELL NO. THIS IS A TIME HONORED TRADITION AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO. THOSE FUZZY DICE AROUND THE MIRROR, I THROW IT UP IN THE RAFTERS. AH! NEXT! YOU CAN DO IT. LOOK AT THAT! THANK YOU. I'LL BE ON THE BENCH IF YOU NEED ME. THAT WAS A GOOD TOSS. PEACE, GENTLEMEN. ** WE'VE GOT OUR PARTS FROM CLASSIC INDUSTRIES. SO THE CLIENT OF THIS '69 CAMARO WANTS A FULL LUXURIOUS BENTLEY INSPIRED INTERIOR. AND NO BENTLEY IS GOING TO HAVE CRANK WINDOWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO UPGRADE TO A FULL POWER WINDOW SETUP. '67/'69 CAMARO WINDOW ASSEMBLY. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER. WE'VE GOT THE WEATHERSTRIPPING, WE'VE GOT THE GLASS AND WE'VE GOT THE INSIDE TRACKS. WIRE UP MY BOMB HERE. ALL RIGHT, COMING DOWN. THANK YOU, MAN. - NO PROBLEM. WE'VE GOT THE GLASS IN THE HOLE, DIDN'T GET NO BREAKS. GOT ALL BRAND NEW TRACK, BRAND NEW POWER MOTOR, BRAND NEW EVERYTHING. GLASS DROPPED DOWN NICE AND EASY. ON TO THE NEXT DOOR. ALL RIGHT, SO THINGS ARE COMING ALONG NICELY HERE. WE'VE GOT ALL THE SUSPENSION ON. THIS IS GOING TO HANDLE LIKE A DREAM. TODAY I HAD CHARLIE AND HIS WIFE, ANNIE, COME BY BECAUSE I THINK CHARLIE IS MORE INTO THE PERFORMANCE STUFF. HIS WIFE IS DEFINITELY WEARING THE SHOES IN THE DESIGN DEPARTMENT. WE'VE GOT THE WHEELS IN, BUT I'VE GOT THEM HERE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE THE GOLD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY WANT. YEAH, THOSE AREN'T GOLD. THAT'S LIKE CREAM OR... IT'S A FUNNY COLOR. IT'S BEIGE. IF I WANT A KNOCKDOWN COLOR, I'LL SAY THAT. BUT IF I SAID GOLD, I WANT GOLD. ARE THESE MY CHOICES? THESE ARE YOUR CHOICES. EVERYBODY LIKE CHOICES. EVERYBODY LIKES CHOICES. ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME THE ONES YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE AND WE'LL NARROW IT DOWN. WELL THAT'S CHOCOLATE BROWN, SO THAT'S RIDICULOUS. CHOCOLATE BROWN IS OUT. I DON'T WANT CHOCOLATE BROWN. I WANT GOLD, LIKE THIS GOLD. IT'S PRETTY GOLD. IT'S A LITTLE BRONZEY. THAT'S A LITTLE MUSTARDY. YOU KEEP THIS... I'M GOING TO PICK THIS. ALL RIGHT, SORRY. SHE'S GOT THIS AESTHETIC, LIKE THIS EYE TO HER THAT WILL TRANSCEND ACROSS EVERYTHING. THAT'S BETTER. THAT'S GOLD. WAIT, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU THAT. YOU HOLD THE GOOD ONES, OKAY? THIS IS AWFUL. THIS IS SOME SORT OF... WHAT DO WE CALL THAT, CAMEL? NO, IT'S NOT GOLD. I DO TEND TO GET A LITTLE TUNED UP ABOUT COLOR. THE EXACT COLOR, THE EXACT BLACK, THE EXACT SHEEN, ALL THAT FOR ME IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. WHY IS THIS EVEN IN THE GOLD PACKAGE? IT'S A FLAT COLOR. THIS IS BETTER. I LIKE HOW SHINY THAT ONE IS. AND IT LOOKS LIKE GOLD. GOLD. WE'VE GOT A WINNER. TOTALLY. SEE? THAT WAS PAINLESS. INTERIOR. WE WERE JUST GOING CLASSIC BEL AIR STYLE BLACK INTERIOR UNLESS YOU HAD ANY OBJECTIONS? I'M THINKING WE OUGHT TO SWITCH IT UP A LITTLE BIT. PUT SOME LCD MONITORS IN THERE. OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. GET SOMETHING FLASHY. YOU'RE JOKING. OPEN THE DOOR, EVERYTHING LIGHTS UP. YOU'RE JOKING. CAN WE MAKE THE DOORS OPEN UP LIKE THIS? - IT IS A '57 CHEVY. THE LINES AREN'T GOING TO CHANGE. IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A '57 CHEVY. BUT IF YOU GET INSIDE THE CAR AND IF WE START PUTTING UP WEIRD LIGHTS AND STUFF THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, IT'S NOT GOING TO FEEL LIKE A '57 CHEVY ANYMORE. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE INSIDE, RIGHT? YEAH, WE'LL STAY ORIGINAL. ANOTHER DREAM CRUSHED. ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, NOAH. THANK YOU, BABY. IT LOOKS GREAT. THE CUSTOMER ON THE '69 CAMARO, HE WANTED A CUSTOM SHEET METAL DASH AND THAT'S KIND OF ABOUT WHERE HE LEFT IT OFF, OTHER THAN HE WANTED A EUROPEAN FEEL. SO I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE EUROPEAN CARS AROUND HERE TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT A EUROPEAN DASH CONSISTS OF. AND WHAT I GATHERED WAS THEY ALL HAD A THREE VENT CENTERPIECE AND THEY ALL HAD A BIG INDIVIDUAL-GAUGE GAUGE POD SETUP. YEAH, I'M PROUD OF IT. IT'S A PRETTY COOL PIECE, LOTS OF CUTS, LOTS OF SHAPING, AND LOTS OF WELDING, BUT I THINK IT'LL DO US WELL. WE BOUGHT A DIRECT FIT '69 CAMARO WIRING KIT AND WE GOT A CUSTOM MADE DASH WITH CUSTOM GAUGES, SO OBVIOUSLY **** LIKE THIS AIN'T GOING TO GO IN THIS DASH, SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE UP OUR OWN WIRING. HOLY... ** OH, JESUS. THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE THAT. THAT WAS THE GOAL TODAY WHEN I CAME TO WORK. I'M GOING TO SHOW THESE MOTHER **** HOW TO CRASH AND BURN. IT BOUNCED. PROBABLY HAVE TO BLAST THE WHOLE **** THING DOWN. WHERE DO YOU WANT YOUR LAST CHECK SENT? JUST DIRECT DEPOSIT. HEY, MARK. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. WHY? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH IT? SCOTT DROPPED IT. BRING THAT CAN OVER HERE FOR A MINUTE. THAT'S WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO RIGHT NOW. HOLY ****. IT'S ALL CRACKED HERE, ALL DOWN THROUGH HERE WHERE'D HE DROP IT FROM, THE ROOF? SO IT'S ****. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CRACKS TO FIX ON THIS THING. IT'S THE LAST THING WE NEED RIGHT NOW TOO. I'M GOING TO GO HOME AND CRY RIGHT NOW. SORRY, MAN. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A GUY WE CAN PUT ON IT RIGHT NOW. THE METAL'S BROKE RIGHT THERE. IT CRACKED OVER HERE TOO. LET'S JUST GET THE FILLER STRIPPED AWAY AND SEE WHAT WE HAVE TO WELD UP. WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE REPAIRS TO IT. SORRY, GUYS. ALL RIGHT. WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. TRY NOT TO KILL SCOTT. WE'RE ALL A TEAM. **** HAPPENS. YEAH. THANKS FOR THE GOOD NEWS. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. YOU'RE NOT WELCOME. I COULD HAVE THROWN THAT ACROSS THE SHOP AND NOT HAVE **** IT UP THAT BAD. I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING GOING ON HERE. ** THIS THING CAME OFF OF THE BENCH, DID A BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE ON THE GROUND AND BUSTED ALL THE MUD OUT OF IT. SO WE'VE GOT TO GRIND IT ALL OUT AND MUD IT UP AND START OVER. WELL AT LEAST WE'RE NOT STARTING OVER OVER. THAT THING WAS PAINTED AND READY TO GO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO IT? YOU HADN'T HEARD, HAD YOU? NO ONE EVER TELLS ME ANYTHING, APPARENTLY. SCOTT GOT **** THREW IT DOWN FROM THE ROOF. NO, IT FELL OFF HIS BENCH WHEN HE WAS WIRING IT. WHAT THE ****. YEAH. NIGHTMARE. THE WORST TIMING. I HOPE HE WAS CRYING. I THINK SO. HE FEELS PRETTY BAD ALREADY. HE CAME OVER HERE AFTER A LITTLE BIT AND HE WAS JUST SHAKING HIS HEAD. HE DESTROYED IT. WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR BUDGET TO REDO THE DASH. IT TOOK A MONTH TO MAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE. RIGHT. THIS IS A FREAKING DISASTER. ** SCOTT, FOR YOU. COOL. HE SPENT ALL DAY SATURDAY ON THIS THING. HE DID ALL THIS WORK, NICE BEAUTIFUL WORK TO IT AND YOU THROW IT ON THE FLOOR. I KNOW MAN, IT CRUSHED MY HEART. I APPRECIATE YOU THROWING AWAY YOUR SATURDAY TO GET IT ALL BACK ON TRACK. NAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO THAT FOR YOU ANY TIME. YOU KNOW THAT. SO LET'S GET IT IN. WOULD YOU MIND HELPING ME GET IT IN? WANT ME TO HELP YOU? ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO COME IN MORE. OKAY, WE'RE ALIGNED. COOL MAN. IT LOOKS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? OUR CUSTOMER WANTS SOME HIGH END CRAZY DESIGN WORK ON THIS INTERIOR. BUT WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK. I KNOW MY GUYS CAN HANDLE IT. IT'S GOING TO LOOK FREAKING PHENOMENAL. THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT IS LEATHER, SO IT'S EVEN A LITTLE MORE NERVE RACKING. QUITE A CHALLENGE. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TO THIS CAR TO TEST-FIT IT AS OFTEN AS I NORMALLY LIKE. IT'LL FIT. I JUST NEED TO MOVE THE TABS OUT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN WE'LL GET IT TO FIT REALLY EASY. BUT FOR NOW WE'LL GO AHEAD AND PUT THE OTHER SEAT IN JUST SO WE CAN SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED ON THAT TOO. OH YEAH, IT'S COZY. I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO ENJOY THEM. GOT TO GO GET THE FRONT SEATS NOW. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY NOTICED THIS YET OR NOT, BUT THIS BUMPER IS TILTED DOWN ON THIS SIDE AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BENT RIGHT HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO FIX THAT. WELL WHILE WE GO IT IN HERE OR NOT. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKING AT THIS BUMPER. IT'S BENT. DID YOU GUYS NOTICE THAT? YOUR HEAD'S JUST TILTED THAT WAY. NAH. MY HEAD'S STRAIGHT AS CAN BE. OKAY. WHAT'S YOUR DIAGNOSIS? IT'S BENT RIGHT HERE. YEAH. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A BUCKLE IN THE FRAME, JUST THE VERY BACK FEW INCHES OF THE FRAME. OH, YEAH. WE CAN PULL THE BUMPER OFF PRETTY EASY. WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STRAIGHTEN THIS PIECE OUT AND REUSE IT. AND HOPEFULLY THE CHROME HOLDS UP. THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT. WHENEVER YOU TRY TO STRAIGHTEN SOMETHING OUT THAT'S CHROME, YOU HAVE TO GO REALLY SLOW SO YOU DON'T CRACK ANYTHING. OH, LOOK AT THAT. YEAH. WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND PUT IT IN A PRESS AND ACTUALLY PUSH DOWN RIGHT HERE. HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTROL THAN TRYING TO DO IT UNDERNEATH THE CAR. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, DAN? I JUST THINK THE CHROME'S GOING TO POP. DON'T SAY THAT. BE POSITIVE. YOU'VE MET ME, RIGHT? PUT THIS UNDERNEATH THERE. YEAH, SO WHEN IT'S SET IN HERE, YOU CAN REALLY SEE HOW BOWED THIS IS RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A LONG WAY TO GO, I THINK, WITHOUT POPPING THE CHROME BUT WE'LL SEE. SO AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO WE HAVE SOME OF THE COOLEST CARS ON THE PLANET THAT COME THROUGH THIS PLACE. NICE MUSCLE CARS, PRO TOURING CARS, HOT RODS. BUT THE ONE THAT REALLY STANDS OUT IS NOAH'S ARK. IT'S PROBABLY BY SIZE, THE SMALLEST VEHICLE THAT WE'VE HAD IN HERE, BUT IT'S THE BEST. AND THIS IS THE LAMBORGHINI OF FLOOR SWEEPERS RIGHT HERE. THIS THING HAS A FULL 1 HORSEPOWER. IT HAS A 260 RPM BRUSH MOTOR ON IT, HAS A FULL 28-INCH SPAN OF FLOOR SCRUBBING POWER. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOAH TO BE ABLE TO GET UP TO ABOUT 4 MILE PER HOUR. YEAH, I SAID 4 MILE PER HOUR. FLOOR SWEEPER, SCRUBBER OR NOT, WE NEED TO CUSTOMIZE IT. BUT APPARENTLY NOAH THINKS THIS THING'S ALREADY THE CAT'S ASS AND WE DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING TO IT. ** WHEN NOAH CRUISES BY ON NOAH'S ARK, IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY FOR HIM. HE'S IN HIS ELEMENT, HE'S OUT THERE, HE'S HAVING FUN. HE FORGETS ABOUT ALL THE DAILY PROBLEMS THAT GO ON. HE'S JUST OUT THERE DRIFTING AROUND. AND HEY, IF HE'S HAPPY, WE'RE ALL HAPPY. ** CHARLIE'S '57 BEL AIR IS ALMOST DONE BUT DAN JUST CAUGHT THAT THE REAR BUMPER WAS BENT A LITTLE BIT. SO DAN AND CHARLES ARE GOING TO TRY AND FIX IT WITHOUT POPPING THE CHROME. LUCKILY FOR US, IT WAS JUST THE BOARDS THAT COLLAPSED. THANK GOODNESS IT WAS NOT THE CHROME, BECAUSE I MEAN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THE DAY FOR US ON THIS JOB. NOTHING. NOTHING, HUH? IT'S THAT LAST LITTLE BIT THAT'S GOING TO BE STUBBORN. SO WE CAN PUSH DOWN HERE. YEAH. AND THEN LET'S MOVE OUR WOOD AROUND. HE SAID LET'S MOVE OUR WOOD AROUND. THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY. GO AHEAD. NOW WE'RE TALKING. OKAY, LET THAT PRESSURE OFF FOR A SECOND. WE GOT IT. DOWN THE EDGE IT'S STRAIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT LOOKS A LOT BETTER THAN IT WAS. I HOPE THIS THING FITS ON HERE CORRECTLY. I HOPE WE DIDN'T GO TOO FAR. CHECK IT OUT MAN, IT'S GOING TO WORK. I THINK IT'S GOING TO... WHOA, GOD YOU'VE GOT A VIOLENT SIDE TO YOU, DON'T YOU? IS YOUR BRACKET LOOSENED UP TO WHERE WE CAN SLIDE YOUR SIDE OUT AND MY SIDE IN? MAN, I'M LOOKING AT MY PRETTY FACE IN THE CHROME. DON'T BE BOTHERING ME RIGHT NOW. ** SO YOU'RE SURE IT'S FINISHED? I'M POSITIVE. DRIVE NICE? IT DRIVES AWESOME. THREE YEARS. IT LOOKS LIKE A MILLION BUCKS. IT'S FREAKING AWESOME. AND IT ONLY COST HALF. SO AFTER THREE YEARS IT'S PRETTY CRAZY TO ACTUALLY SEE THE CAMARO GET COMPLETED. THE WHEELS ON IT, THE INTERIOR REALLY GLOWING THROUGH. THE CAR'S GOT A WICKED STANCE, A KILLER OVER-THE-TOP LOOK. NO MATTER WHERE IT GOES, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE LOVE IT AND BE DRAWN TO IT. THE ORANGE INTERIOR REALLY LOOKS GOOD OUT IN THE SUN. IT POPS. HE ASKED FOR A BENTLEY INTERIOR AND I THINK HE GOT ONE. BENTLEYS DON'T HAVE LEATHER FLOORS. THEY DON'T HAVE LEATHER FLOORS. WHAT YOU GOT, BENTLEY? SCOTT'S CUSTOM DASH TURNED OUT WELL. I KNOW. AND THEN ALL THE CUSTOM BODY MODS. THE ENTIRE BODY ON THIS CAR IS CUSTOM ONE-OFF METAL WORK. SO IT IS WHOLLY UNIQUE. IT LOOKS PRETTY FREAKING FAST JUST SITTING THERE. IT DOES. I WANT TO CHECK OUT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. IT'S GOT A SHAFIROFF RACING MOTOR. CLASSIC BIG BLOCK MOTOR BUT THIS THING'S LOADED FULL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE STUFF. MAKES 650 HORSEPOWER. IT JUST FRICKING RIFFS. MAN THIS THING IS FREAKING KILLER. AND EVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO THESE DETAILS, YOU KNOW. YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK THAT TOOK TO PUT ALL THESE LITTLE DETAILS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THAT HOOD. ONE-OFF STUFF. IT'S WHAT I LOVE. WE NEED TO FRICKING DRIVE IT. LET'S GO DRIVE IT. [ENGINE REVS] SOUNDS LIKE A BEAST. SO I'VE NEVER TALKED TO THIS CLIENT ON THE PHONE AND I DON'T KNOW IF I EVER WILL. BUT I MADE HIM PROMISE TO SEND ME PHOTOS OF IT IN RUSSIA, BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THIS THING ON THE STREETS THERE. THAT'LL KIND OF BRING IT ALL TOGETHER FOR ME. I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE AFTER THREE LONG YEARS. SHE'S GOT TO GO HOME SOME TIME, SO... SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT IN THE GARAGE? YEAH, JUST GOT TO GIVE THE KEYS TO THE ATTENDANT. THEY'RE GOING TO SHIP IT. OKAY. IT'S KIND OF WEIRD TO LEAVE IT LIKE THIS, BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. BYE LITTLE BUDDY. SEE YOU LITTLE GUY. I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD -- [ BOTH LAUGH ] ** ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT I'M DOING IS LAYING OUT A TEMPLATE PATTERN AND I'M TRANSFERRING THIS TO 16-GAUGE SHEET METAL. AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO END UP BEING IS A COVER FOR A RADIATOR ON A '57 CHEVY. THE HOOD ROLLS OVER REAL FAR, SO A LOT OF RADIATOR AND UGLY STUFF YOU DON'T CARE TO SEE IS EXPOSED. SO JUST A LITTLE FANCY PIECE, JUST ALL EYE CANDY. BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IN MY WORLD. ALL RIGHT, SO WE'VE GOT OUR PIECE ALL CUT OUT, DIMPLED, DYED, BROKE. THIS SURE LOOKS PRETTY WHEN IT'S DONE. ** SO A COUPLE MONTHS AGO CHARLIE BROUGHT IN HIS '57 CHEVY. TODAY WE'RE PUTTING ON THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO MAKE IT THE WILD TIRE BURN HE'S BEEN WANTING. WE'VE JUST GOT TO MOUNT SOME SPEAKERS IN THE TRUNK AND THEN CHARLIE CAN HAVE HIS LITTLE TIME CAPSULE BACK. I THINK THE FINAL TOUCH TO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT IS GOING TO LOOK KILLER. SO THROW THESE ON AND WE'RE GOING FOR A TEST DRIVE. DELIVERING A CAR TO THE CUSTOMER IS THE BEST PART OF THIS JOB. THEY'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS THING FOREVER. WE PULLED OFF AN AWESOME JOB. GIVE IT TO THEM SO THEY CAN FRICKING HAUL ASS OUT OF HERE. THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT. THAT LOOKS AWESOME. THE FONZ ROLLING UP HERE? OH MY GOD. IT -- OH, MY GOD, I LOVE IT. THAT'S GOOD. NOAH! HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES? SERIOUSLY. I LOVE THE GOLD FINS. IT WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING TIMES TEN. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU. I MEAN, THE STANCE IS KILLER. I WAS REALLY TORN ON HOW WE WERE GOING TO DO THE GOLD. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME MIXING THE PAINT. WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF FLAKE IN IT. ADD IN A FLAT CLEAR OVER THE TOP, SO IT REALLY POPS IN THE SUN AND SPARKLES. I THINK IT'S SO CLASSY AND BADASS. IT'S PERFECTION. IN THE PERFORMANCE DEPARTMENT, WE HAVE A CRAZY OVER-THE-TOP SUSPENSION, COILOVER SHOCKS ALL THE WAY AROUND. THEY'RE FULLY ADJUSTABLE. YOU CAN DIAL-IN FOR HOW YOU WANT TO DRIVE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN ADJUSTABLE? FULLY ADJUSTABLE. YOU CAN MAKE IT SOFTER. YOU CAN MAKE IT RIDE HARDER. YOU CAN MESS WITH THE HANDLING ALL YOU WANT. I'VE GOT IT DIALED IN NICE AND STIFF FOR OUR LITTLE PERFORMANCE DRIVING. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT THIS THING'S MADE OF. MAYBE YOU CAN SHOW ME WHAT IT'S MADE OF. NO, NO, NO. I'VE DONE THE BURNOUT TEST. YES, IT WILL DO A BURNOUT. IT'S FREAKING WICKED. OUT BACK WE'VE GOT A KILLER 4-LINK KIT HOOKED UP TO A COOLY CUSTOM FABRICATED FULL 9-INCH. IT IS BUILT TO THE HILT. I KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO DRIVE THIS THING. I KNOW YOU'RE AN ANIMAL ON THE STREET. ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS GET IN IT AND JUST HAUL ASS AS FAST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. THE INTERIOR, I KNOW YOU WANTED TO KEEP IT. TOTAL CLASSIC STYLE INTERIOR. I MEAN... ALL ORIGINAL. YEAH. YOU SAID TIME CAPSULE AND I KEPT THAT IN MIND. WE'VE GOT IT COMPLETELY RESTORED. THIS IS PERFECT. YOU CAN DO THESE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. THIS IS PERFECT. THIS IS SPECTACULAR. HEY, LET'S CHECK OUT THIS ENGINE. OH, MY GOODNESS. DID YOU REDO THE GRILL? OH, MY GOSH. THE GRILL? OH! [LAUGHS] IT'S GOLD! IT'S BEAUTIFUL! THIS BIG GOLD NUGGET SITTING RIGHT INSIDE OF THERE. IT STILL LOOKS VINTAGE LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BUT IT DOES ALL THAT CRAZY STUFF. IT'S JUST MODERN EVERYTHING. IT'S PERFECT. IT IS A MEAN STREET MOTOR. 470 HORSEPOWER, ALMOST 500 FOOT- POUNDS OF TORQUE. WE'VE GOT A MASSIVE ALUMINUM RADIATOR, WE'VE GOT DUAL FANS, WE'VE GOT FULL LENGTH HEADERS, BRAND NEW PERFORMANCE STEERING BOX. WE'VE GOT A WILWOOD MASTER CYLINDER, POWER AS WELL. YOU CLEANED UP THE WHOLE BACK BAY OF IT TOO. ALL THIS. YUP. WE'VE GOT ALL THE FIREWALL CLEANED UP, WE'VE GOT THE WHEEL WELLS CLEANED UP. SCOTT TURNED OUT THIS BADASS CUSTOM PIECE TO COVER IT UP AND MAKE IT ALL LOOK CLEAN. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. IT'S SO GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU GUYS LIKE IT. IT'S MORE THAN WE COULD HAVE EVER DREAMED OF. IT'S AMAZING. THE MOST FUN PART ABOUT THE CAR IS THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE. SO YOU JUST LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY. I'M READY TO GO. HONEY? IS THAT OKAY? I'LL WATCH. YOU PUT A HELMET ON AND STAND ON THE SIDELINES BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE ROWDY. BE CAREFUL. NOAH. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT THIS. IT'S OKAY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS. SHOW ME WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. TO HELL WITH BEING CAREFUL, RIGHT? YOU GOT IT. [ ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE ] 75 PRETTY GOOD. IT GETS YOUR HEART PUMPING. YEAH, THERE YOU GO. OH, ****. COULD NOT BE HAPPIER. IT IS TRULY SOMETHING THAT IS REMARKABLE. AND WHAT WE LOVE MOST ABOUT IT, IT'S THE ONLY ONE IN THIS WORLD LIKE IT. I HAVEN'T SEEN MY WIFE THIS HAPPY IN QUITE SOME TIME. SHE'S ECSTATIC. SHE LOVES IT. DOES IT HAVE A RADIO? YES, IT DOES. IT HAS A RADIO? [SCREAMS] BABY, DON'T! Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
