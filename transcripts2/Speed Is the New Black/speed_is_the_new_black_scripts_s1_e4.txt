 MIGHT NOT MAKE IT TO THE PARTY. COME ON, GIRL. - HOLD ON. - COME ON, GIRL. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME FUN. LET'S MAKE IT SHOOT FLAMES. AND YOU'LL LOVE THE MENU. THIS IS LIKE A CARROT FOR THE HORSE. BUT CAN WE GET THESE 50-YEAR-OLD MACHINES READY FOR THE MAIN EVENT? LITTLE CAR, BIG PAIN IN THE ASS. SORRY, GUYS. I COULDN'T HARDLY BELIEVE THAT, THAT WAS MY CAR.

 HERE AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO, MY TEAM OF VISIONARIES AND MASTER CRAFTSMEN TAKE CARS OF ALL KINDS AND TRANSFORM THEM INTO CUSTOM-TAILORED HIGH-PERFORMANCE RIDES. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS AND HAUL ASS? WE'RE THE SHOP FOR YOU, BECAUSE HERE, SPEED IS THE NEW BLACK. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS SO, TODAY, I HAVE A CLIENT BRINGING IN HIS TRIUMPH TR3B. NOW, WE DON'T USUALLY SEE A LOT OF BRITISH CARS AROUND HERE, SO THIS SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING CHANGE OF PACE FOR US. HOW YOU DOING? - HEY, ARE YOU NOAH? - YEAH. NICE TO MEET YOU. - NOAH, NICE TO MEET YOU... - HEY, NICE... - ...FINALLY. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. IT'S BEEN AWHILE. THANKS FOR BRINGING THE CAR IN. OH, YOU'RE WELCOME. IT IS ABSOLUTELY FREEZING OUT HERE. LET'S BRING IT INSIDE, REAL QUICK, AND WE'LL TALK IN THERE. YOU GOT IT. THE TRIUMPH TR3B WAS MADE IN ENGLAND IN 1962. THEY HAD A FOUR-CYLINDER, 2.1-LITER ENGINE, MADE A LITTLE BIT OVER 100 HORSEPOWER AND ACTUALLY WENT, CLAIMED 110 MILES PER HOUR. SO, THEY WERE A FAST LITTLE CAR IN THEIR DAY. ABOUT THE FURTHEST I'VE GONE IN THIS CAR IN A LONG TIME. THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY COOL CAR. THEY ONLY MADE A COUPLE THOUSAND OF THEM, AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH THE BUILD. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR HISTORY WITH THIS TR3B. OH, I TELL YOU. THIS HAS JUST BEEN A LOVELY CAR. I JUST WISH I HAD MORE TIME IN THE CAR. WHAT KIND OF SHAPE WAS THIS CAR IN WHEN YOU FIRST GOT IT? WELL, WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THE CAR, THE CAR WAS WHITE. AND MY SON TOOK AN AUTO MECHANICS CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING. AND SO, THAT WAS IT, RIGHT THERE. THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY DISASSEMBLED. THE FRAME WAS ACTUALLY UP AGAINST THE WALL OF THE GARAGE. IT HAD SOME ISSUES WITH BODY PARTS FITTING. I ALWAYS GET A LITTLE SCARED WHEN I HEAR A CLIENT WORKED ON HIS OWN CAR IN HIS GARAGE. BUT WHEN I HEAR A KID WORKED ON THE CAR WHILE HE WAS STILL IN AUTO REPAIR CLASS, THAT JUST TERRIFIES ME. AFTER ABOUT 15 YEARS, I THOUGHT, "WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THIS." DOES THAT PUT US TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW? - WE PUT IT TO THIS COLOR. - RIGHT. BUT THIS IS NOT THE SAME PAINT JOB. OKAY. SO WE'RE ON... BUT SO WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT ONE, HERE, IN JUST A MINUTE, OKAY? SO, THIS LITTLE TRIUMPH HAS ACTUALLY LIVED QUITE THE LIFE. IT TOOK DALE ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO RUN ME THROUGH ALL THE HISTORY. I THINK WE'RE AT FOUR BODY SHOPS, THREE PAINT JOBS, AND ONE HORRIFIC ACCIDENT BEFORE IT ROLLED THROUGH THE DOORS TODAY, SO, WELCOME. WELCOME, TRIUMPH. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. ARE YOU LOOKING TO CHANGE THE LOOK, THE PERFORMANCE? WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I'M LOOKING FOR A VERY SPIRITED CAR, A CAR THAT I CAN DRIVE REALLY FAST. - FAST? - YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I MEAN, I HEARD THIS WAS A SPEED SHOP, SO... - WE'RE GONNA... - SO, THIS IS WHY I'M HERE. WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS THING HAUL ASS. WHEN YOU DRIVE A CLASSIC CAR, YOU LITERALLY FEEL THE ROAD. WITH NEW CARS TODAY, THEY'RE BUFFERED, AND YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO FEEL THAT ROAD, TO FEEL THE ENGINE, AND TO HEAR IT. AND AGAIN, IT'S A FEELING THAT YOU DON'T FORGET. THESE CARS ALWAYS HAD A GREAT RACE HISTORY, LOTS OF PERFORMANCE. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN DOING SUPERCHARGER ON IT? YEAH, YEAH. I THINK I WANT TO KIND OF PUT THAT RACE SPIRIT BACK INTO THIS MODEL. WE CAN TAKE THE WINDSHIELD AND CHANGE THE WINDSHIELD TO THE SMALLER, SINGLE WINDSCREENS. DO YOU THINK A SINGLE WINDSCREEN OR TWO BUBBLES? - I THINK TWO BUBBLES. - THAT WOULD LOOK COOL. AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE PAINT A LITTLE MORE FLASHY. - YEAH, UH-HUH. - MAYBE A PEARLESCENCE GRAY? YEAH. I THINK THAT WOULD LOOK GREAT. AND ADD A STRIPE TO IT. I THINK THAT COULD BRING OUT THE RACE LOOK. SO THE TR3 HAD A REPUTATION FOR HANGING WITH MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE CARS, LIKE ASTONS AND JAGS, FOR JUST A FRACTION OF THE PRICE. SO, I THINK, WITH A LITTLE FINESSING ON THE PERFORMANCE END, YOU KNOW, WE CAN TURN THIS INTO THE LITTLE HOT ROD DALE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET TO THIS WHOLE TIME. I'LL KIND OF GET SOME DIFFERENT PAINT SAMPLES GOING FOR YOU AND FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF STRIPE WE'RE GONNA USE. AFTER WE CHECK OUT THE SUSPENSION AND THE BRAKES, I'LL REPORT BACK AND KIND OF LET YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE WITH EVERYTHING. - SOUNDS GREAT. -THANK YOU. - I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. - ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU, NOAH. THANKS. THERE YOU GO, SCOTT. AFTER MEETING WITH DALE, I GOT A FEW IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THIS THING THE SPEEDSTER HE WANTS. BUT FIRST, I WANT TO TALK TO CHARLES AND SCOTT AND SEE WHAT KIND OF IDEAS THEY CAN COME UP WITH. I TOLD YOU WE WERE GONNA DO YOUR FAVORITE CAR SOON, AND HERE IT IS. WHAT IS THIS? I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS. - THIS IS A TRIUMPH... - THIS IS A JOKE. - ...TR3B. - THIS IS A JOKE. LITTLE CLASSIC EUROPEAN ROADSTER. WHAT IS THIS CAR? TRIUMPH, TO ME, IS A MOTORCYCLE. IT'S ACTUALLY A COOL CAR. WALKING OUT TO THE CAR, SCOTT WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE WERE PLAYING A JOKE ON HIM BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T WORKED ON A LOT OF BRITISH CARS, YET HE'S IN ON THIS DESIGN MEETING. SCOTT LIKES HIS PIE TO BE APPLE AND HIS CARS TO BE SLAMMED DOWN C-10 PICKUP TRUCKS, SO HE'S GONNA HAVE TO SUCK IT UP AND WORK ON THIS TRIUMPH. NO DISRESPECT TO THE OWNER, EVERYBODY LIKES SOMETHING DIFFERENT. BUT I THINK I SEE MY CHALLENGE. YOU CAN DO IT. WE'LL PUT YOU TO THE TEST ON THIS ONE. IT'S STILL A TRIUMPH WHEN WE'RE DONE, SO I'M STILL WONDERING -- IS THIS CAR A JOKE? ARE WE REALLY SUPPOSED TO MAKE THIS THING A HOT ROD? THE GUY'S A CAR NUT. HE'S GOT, LIKE, 10 LITTLE BRITISH CARS. THE GUY'S A NUT, BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CAR NUT. AFTER HE GOT THIS THING RUNNING, HE WAS DRIVING DOWN THIS BACK-COUNTRY ROAD, AND HE T-BONED A SUBURBAN, BROKE BOTH OF HIS ANKLES, AND ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL FOR A WHILE, AND TOTALED THE WHOLE CAR. SO, THEN, IT WAS PUT BACK TOGETHER. BUT HE'S NOT FEELING IT. HE DOESN'T LIKE IT. WHAT HE ACTUALLY WANTS IS A FASTER CAR. WHAT'S A FASTER? HE WANTS A MUCH FASTER CAR TO DRIVE THROUGH WINE COUNTRY LIKE A MADMAN. I MEAN, WHAT? WE GONNA FAB A FULL DOOR FOR THE GUY SO HE DON'T FALL OUT THIS TIME? GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS. IF YOU LOWER THE CAR ANYMORE, THE GUY'S GOT TO REACH TO HIS ANKLES TO GET THE DOORKNOB. AND YOU ALREADY SAID HE BROKE HIS LEGS. I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE VISUALIZING. HELP ME OUT. STEER ME RIGHT. WHAT ARE WE DOING? VINTAGE RACE-CAR STYLE. SO, ON THE FRONT END, TAKE OFF THESE LITTLE BUMPERETTES, TWO OLD-SCHOOL FOG LIGHTS. MOVING BACK, SPORTIER MIRRORS, CHOPPING THE WINDSHIELD. RIGHT HERE, TWO LITTLE SPEED BUMPS. ON THE INTERIOR, HIGHER BACK SEATS BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA NEED TO RUN SOME HARNESSES FOR THIS GUY. WE DON'T WANT HIM TO ALMOST DIE AGAIN. AND BACK OF THAT, ROLL BAR. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING GOOD. IT'LL BE LOW AND SLEEK, AND NO MATTER WHAT SCOTT SAYS, NOBODY GIVES A. THIS GUY'S GONNA LOVE IT. AND HE'LL BE HAULING ASS DOWN HIS TWISTY WINE ROAD WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE. AND HOPEFULLY, NO ONE TURNS IN FRONT OF HIM. WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WITH THE WHEELS, TOO. WE ARE DOING SOMETHING WITH THE WHEELS -- EITHER MINILITES OR BLACK THESE OUT AND MAKE THEM LOOK MEAN. LOWER IT. WE'VE GOT TO LOWER IT AT LEAST AN INCH OR 2. I THINK IT WILL LOOK FREAKING TOUGH. SUPERCHARGER WILL ADD A TON MORE HORSEPOWER. AND THEN, WE JUST GOT TO NUT AND BOLT THE WHOLE THING AND MAKE SURE IT CAN TAKE IT... - OKAY. - ...'CAUSE WE KNOW SCOTT CAN'T. THIS MIGHT BE THE CAR THAT GETS TO SCOTT'S SENSITIVE CAR SIDE. THIS MIGHT BE, LIKE, HIS BIG BREAKTHROUGH. YEAH, PEARL PINK WITH LOLLIPOP ON THE SIDE AND COTTON CANDY INTERIOR. WE'RE ASKING YOU TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX ON THIS ONE. CAN YOU DO THAT? THIS IS ONE YOU'LL PROBABLY CUT ME LOOSE TO DO WHAT I WANT TO, RIGHT? WELL, I MIGHT JUST CUT YOU LOOSE IF. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, SHREK. I'VE NEVER WITH ONE OF THESE. ME NEITHER. SO, THIS TRIUMPH HAS HAD SO MUCH WORK DONE ON IT OVER THE YEARS IN SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES. WE'VE GOT TO GET IT TORN DOWN COMPLETELY TO SEE WHAT'S LURKING UNDER THE SURFACE. I THINK WE'RE GETTING READY TO HAVE A TRIUMPH ASS-WHOOPING. YEAH. THERE YOU GO. WE USUALLY DO A LOT OF CLASSIC AMERICAN STUFF, SO I'M ALWAYS WELCOME SOMETHING NEW, A NEW CHALLENGE. I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THE GUYS TO MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT. THERE SHE IS. - DUDE, HEY. - WHAT DID YOU GET US INTO? WELL, LOOK AT THE LIGHT? THEY'RE ALL SOLDERED ON. GOT IT. THERE'S SCREWS ALL THROUGH HERE. LIKE, THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES. SOME ARE STANDARD. SOME ARE METRIC. THAT'S BAD NEWS, REALLY. MORE BACKYARD. THREE HOURS, AND WE GOT ONE FLIPPING PIECE OFF. I JUST HOPE WE'VE STILL GOT A JOB AFTER THIS. ALL RIGHT! THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF A HALF-HOUR AGO. SO, NOW THAT THE TRIUMPH IS TORN DOWN, I'M GONNA SEND IT OVER TO THE BODY SHOP SO THEY CAN STRIP DOWN THE EXTERIOR OF THE CAR. IT'S TIME TO GET THIS THING STRIPPED DOWN AND SEE WHAT ELSE WE FIND. WELL, I STARTED STRIPPING SOME OF THE PAINT OFF THE CAR, GETTING INTO IT, AND FOUND A LOT OF BODYWORK. WE DID SEE SOME DAMAGE UNDER THERE, BUT NOTHING MAJOR SO FAR. MAN, WAS THIS CAR MADE OUT OF BODY FILLER OR WHAT? PRETTY MUCH, MAN. CHECK THAT OUT. - WOW. THAT'S, LIKE, A HALF AN INCH DEEP. THAT'S BAD. AFTER MARK SANDED OFF ALL THE PAINT ON THE ROCKER PANELS, WE DISCOVERED THAT SOMEBODY HAD FILLED THEM FULL OF BODY FILLER RIGHT OVER ALL THE OLD RUST THAT WAS THERE. THEY DID A HORRIBLE JOB. ALL RIGHT, SO, I'M GONNA ORDER PATCH PANELS. AND IF IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE, I'LL LET YOU KNOW, AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM YOURSELF. BUT EVERY TIME WE GET INTO THESE CARS... IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS. ...A FREAKING DISASTER. WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE A 1962 TRIUMPH A REALLY COOL, UPGRADED RACING FEEL. HOWEVER, THIS THING HAS BEEN APART AND BACK TOGETHER SO MANY TIMES THAT BODY ISSUES JUST KEEP PILING UP. SOMEONE HAS MODIFIED THIS FROM RUNNING AN ACTUAL BUMPER TO RUNNING JUST THESE BUMPER UPRIGHTS. THIS SECTION HERE WAS ALL CRACKED, SO, NONE OF THIS IS GONNA WORK. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MODIFY BUMPER BRACKETS, CUT THIS VALANCE APART, WELD NEW PIECES IN, AND REMOVE A BUNCH OF REALLY HOKEY WORK THAT'S BEHIND IT. TO GET THE BUMPER BRACKETS OUT, I HAD TO TAKE THE SWAY BAR OUT AND THIS GOOFY PLATE THAT SOMEBODY MADE THAT ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE BUMPER BRACKETS, WHICH IS KIND OF A WEIRD PLACE TO MOUNT A SWAY BAR, BUT WHATEVER. I'M NOT A MECHANIC. I'M GONNA CUT THESE PIECES HERE OUT, AND THEN, JUST MAKE THE WHOLE THING SMOOTH ALL THE WAY ACROSS. SO, WE'RE GONNA DITCH THESE BIG, BULKY BRACKETS THAT SOMEBODY MADE THAT, THEY SET THIS THING WAY OFF THE CAR LIKE THIS. SO, WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENT BRACKET FOR THESE NEW BUMPERETTES WE GOT FROM BRITISH VICTORIA, SET IT IN A LOT CLOSER TO THE BODY, AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA LOWER IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT SO IT DOESN'T BLOCK THE GRILLE SO MUCH. AND IT'LL STILL LOOK PRETTY FACTORY ORIGINAL, JUST SLIGHTLY BETTER. LOOKS WAY BETTER. SO, TIFFANY'S OUR 1966 SHOP TRUCK WE ALL BUILT TOGETHER. SHE HAS NELSON RACING MIRROR IMAGE TWIN TURBOS AND A WICKED HOLLEY FUEL-INJECTION SYSTEM. SHE'S PUTTING OUT ABOUT 1,000 HORSEPOWER AT THIS POINT. SO, TIFFANY'S BEEN SITTING IN THE SHOP ALL WINTER. IT'S TIME TO DUST HER OFF AND GET HER IN TIP-TOP SHAPE AND GET THIS TRUCK ON THE ROAD THIS SUMMER. WHAT'S THE DEAL? WON'T GO? UH-OH. DAMN. THIS THING'S RUNNING WORSE THAN IT'S EVER RUN. - WHAT WRONG WITH THIS THING? - I MEAN, IT'S LIKE... - IT SMOOTHS OUT LIKE... IT'S RUNNING WORSE AND WORSE. DUDE, WE BETTER GET THIS THING BACK. UH-OH, DON'T DIE. DON'T DIE ON US. DON'T DIE. I HOPE WE CAN PULL OUT INTO TRAFFIC. COME ON, TIFFANY. DON'T YOU LOVE US? - COME ON, GIRL. - HOLD ON. COME ON, GIRL. OH, SHE'S RUNNING. COME ON, BABY. YEAH. LET GO. OH. OH! SHE'S GIVING US A LITTLE BIT. UGH. IT'S MISSING ON ALL CYLINDERS. WE GOT STUCK IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. PEOPLE WERE ANGRY AT US. OTHER DRIVERS IN TRAFFIC WERE ANGRY AT US. YOU'VE EMBARRASSED -- JUST KIDDING. IT'S NOT RACE READY? IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT ANYTHING READY. SO, TIFFANY SHOULD MAKE ABOUT 1,000 HORSEPOWER. BUT WHEN YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP THE RAMP INTO YOUR SHOP, YOU MIGHT NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. SO, IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT WE FINALLY GOT THE ROCKER PANELS FOR THE TRIUMPH TO REPLACE THE OLD, RUSTY ONES. SO, NOW, WE ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO BODYWORK AND PAINT. OLD ROCKER PANELS GONE. NEW ROCKER PANELS IN. IT'S NICE AND FLUSH WITH OUR QUARTER PANEL. IT'S NICE AND FLUSH WITH OUR FENDER. IT'S A MUCH BETTER REPAIR THAN WHAT THE PREVIOUS REPAIR WAS, BOTTOM LINE. SO, I REALLY WANT TO SHOW OFF TIFFANY TO THE ST. LOUIS CROWD, BUT AFTER THAT TEST DRIVE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S HAPPENING. SO, I GOT TO TALK WITH CHARLES AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET THIS PROJECT TOGETHER AND HAVE A COOL PARTY, AS WELL. I WAS THINKING WE COULD THROW IT A PROPER ST. LOUIS HOMECOMING. WE GOT LOTS OF COOL CAR PEOPLE AROUND HERE... I LIKE IT. ...AND MAYBE INVITE THEM OVER, DO SOME CRAZY. HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH THE TRUCK. BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING, SOMETHING SPECIAL. LIKE THE TRANSMISSION WORKING? WE NEED THE -- NUMBER ONE, GET THE TRANSMISSION WORKING. I WANT A BADASS TRANSMISSION. - ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE. I DON'T WANT ANOTHER FREAKING COMPUTER ON THE DAMN TRUCK. AND I WANT A WICKED TORQUE CONVERTER. IT'S GOT SO MUCH FREAKING POWER. LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE AND REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY STRONG 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BREAK IT AGAIN THIS YEAR. I WAS THINKING, WE COULD DO ONE MASSIVE, HELLACIOUS BURNOUT. I JUST WANT TO SIT THERE AND ROAST THE TIRES. WE JUST NEED A LINE LOCK. SO, A LINE LOCK ALLOWS YOU TO APPLY THE BRAKES TO THE FRONT WHEELS AND NOT THE REAR WHEELS, SO YOU CAN DO A CRAZY BURNOUT. IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BIG, STUPID BURNOUT... I KNOW IT'S CHEESY, BUT LET'S MAKE IT SHOOT FLAMES. LIKE, FLAMES? LIKE, FLAMES? WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO IS, MELT THE PAINT OFF ANOTHER CAR'S DOOR, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. SO, TIFFANY'S A TRUCK THAT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO REMEMBER, BUT I THINK IF SHE SHOOTS FLAMES, SHE'LL BE UNFORGETTABLE. BUT SERIOUSLY, FLAMES. - YEAH, THAT'S COOL. - STUPID BURNOUT MACHINE. WE'LL HAVE THE BUILT-TO-THE-HILT TRANSMISSION, THE TIFFANY PARTY. I'M EXCITED. LOWDOWN THROWDOWN. - LET'S DO IT. - ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU. GET BACK TO WORK. ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY IN THE SHOP'S HAD A HAND IN BUILDING THE SHOP TRUCK. SO, WHEN IT'S TIME TO WORK ON THE TRUCK, EVERYBODY GETS IN THE SPIRIT. - HEY. IS THAT HOW YOU DO IT, SCOTT? - YEAH, THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. AIN'T THAT HOW YOU DO IT? DO YOU DO LIKE THIS, TOO? THIS -- WE'RE IN THE PARADE. - START HANDING OUT THE CANDY. - WHOA. HERE COMES CLASSIC CAR STUDIO WITH SNOOP DOGG IN THE TWIN-TURBOED SHOP TRUCK. YEAH. SO, THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO TO GET TIFFANY READY FOR A BIG NIGHT IS TO GET RID OF THAT OLD TRANSMISSION. SO, I ORDERED A BRAND-NEW TURBO 400 WITH A REALLY NICE TORQUE CONVERTER THAT'LL HANDLE ALL 1,000 HORSEPOWER. LOOK AT THAT. TURBO 400, MAN, A LOT STRONGER THAN THAT 4L60. AND I'LL GET THE OLD ONE BUSTED. WE'RE GONNA YANK THE DRIVESHAFT OUT, RIGHT OFF THE BAT, AND THEN, WE'LL START TAKING THE TRANSMISSION MOUNT LOOSE IN THE FRAME. JUST TAKE IT OUT. I DON'T THINK... AND THEN, WE CAN SLIDE IT AROUND, DRILL SOME NEW HOLES FOR PUTTING A NEW TRANNY IN 'CAUSE WE'RE GOING FROM A 4L60 TO A TURBO 400. TRANNY'S UP. GOT THE BOLT. HOLEY SHNIKEYS. LOOK AT THAT. BRING IT ON IN, SCOTT. EASY. WE READY? HOW'S IT LOOK? GIVE ME SOME EYES. LOOKING GOOD, MAN. CRANKING IT DOWN. CRANKING IT IN THERE. NOW, WHAT YOU WANT? GET THIS THING OUT THE WAY. LET'S PUT THE CROSSBAR IN THERE. THE CROSSMEMBER FOR THIS TRANSMISSION FITS INSIDE A C-CHANNEL FRAME, SO IT'S REALLY TIGHT FROM SIDE TO SIDE. GEEZ, IT'S A... PUZZLE. WE'VE KIND OF GOT TO TAP IT IN AT AN ANGLE. AND IT'S A ONE-WAY FIT. WE JUST GOT TO FIND THAT WAY THAT FIT IS. THERE IT IS. WE ONTO A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING, HERE. I HOPE SO. THERE IT IS. IN LIKE FLYNN. LOOK AT THAT. RIGHT ON THE MONEY. A SUCCESS. BOSS NOAH THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA TO SHOOT FLAMES OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK. SO, WE'RE GONNA PULL THE EXHAUST OFF SO I CAN GET TO IT AND WELD THE BUNG IN THE RIGHT WAY, TIE UP SOME OF THE WRAP HERE, AND THEN SLAM THIS THING BACK TOGETHER. WE GOT A COUPLE THINGS TO WIRE UP. SO, ONCE WE GET THE SPARK PLUG INSTALLED ON THE EXHAUST, WE'RE GONNA HIT A BUTTON. WE'RE GONNA STEAL SOME SPARK. IT'S GONNA FILL UP WITH GAS, AND WE'RE GONNA SHOOT SOME FLAMES. MAYBE A 1, 2-FOOT FLAME, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WHICH OUGHT TO LOOK PRETTY COOL AT NIGHT. SO, DALE WANTS THE TRIUMPH TO HAVE MORE OF A RACECAR FEEL, SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE OFF THE BIG, ORIGINAL WINDSHIELD, PUT TWO REALLY NICE LITTLE WINDSHIELDS ON THERE THAT'S GONNA GIVE IT THE LOOK OF SOME OF THE VINTAGE SPEEDSTERS BACK IN THE DAY. SO, WE GOT THESE COOL LITTLE VINTAGE RACING WINDSCREENS TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BRITISH RACECAR LOOK. I GOT TO DRILL HOLES, MAKE THEM FIT, FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GO. TOO BAD THE KIT DOESN'T COME WITH COMPLIMENTARY SET OF VINTAGE GOGGLES. YEAH, PRETTY COOL. SO, THANKFULLY, DALE THOUGHT THE INTERIOR WAS A BIT DRAB, BECAUSE IT WAS. SO, WE GET TO SPRUCE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. THE TRIUMPH IS AN ITTY-BITTY LITTLE CAR, WHOLE LOT OF PARTS. YOU FIGURE, FOR A LITTLE BITTY TWO-SEATER THAT STANDS ABOUT 2 FOOT TALL, THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE CAR. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND MIMIC THE STRIPE THAT'S COMING DOWN THE CENTER OF THE CAR. WE'RE GONNA PUT THE PATTERN IN THE SEATS. INSIDES, WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO WITH THE PERF. NA, NA, NA, NA. THIS WILL BE THE COLOR YOU'LL SEE ON THE OUTSIDE. IT'S NOT GONNA BE A DRASTIC TWO-TONE, WHICH SOME PEOPLE LIKE, I'M NOT REAL FOND OF. I LIKE A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE ON A TWO-TONE. AND WE'VE CARRIED THE TWO-TONE OVER INTO THE DASHBOARD, WHICH, I THINK, IS GONNA BE A PRETTY COOL LITTLE TOUCH. WE'RE HAVING FUN WITH THE THEME. I THINK IT'LL LOOK REALLY GOOD WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH IT. WE WORK LONG HOURS, YOU KNOW? WE DON'T GET TO EAT VERY OFTEN, SO I SEE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME TOAST. I'M FRICKING STARVING RIGHT NOW, AND DUSTIN HERE, HOPEFULLY DID THIS RIGHT, SO WE GET ABOUT 2 1/2 FOOT OF FLAME. I'LL BE ABLE TO CHAR THIS IN ABOUT TWO SECONDS. - STAND BACK FARTHER. - OH, IT'LL BURN. TAKE A BITE. DO IT. HOW WAS IT? COULD YOU FEEL IT? YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T BURN THE TRUCK TO THE GROUND, AND WE MADE A GREAT FIRE. CHARLES GOT TO EAT A SOLID MEAL. WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD. SO, WE HELPED DALE PICK HIS COLORS, AND THEY ARE PERFECT. IT'S TIME FOR CHARLES TO MIX UP HIS PAINT AND GET IT IN THE BOOTH. SO, FOR THE TRIUMPH, WE PICKED THIS GRAY. IT'S A CUSTOM COLOR. IT'S GOT A LOT OF HEAVY METALLIC. SO, WITH THE CURVES OF THIS BODY, THE PEAKS WILL BE BRIGHT, GRAYISH SILVER. AND THEN, THE SIDE TONE WILL BE A DARKER COLOR. THIS CAR IS GONNA LOOK LIKE IT'S GLOWING IN THE SUN. SO, WE GOT THE CENTER LINES ALL MARKED OUT ON THE TRIUMPH. NOW, WE'RE MEASURING OFF THE CENTER LINE TO WHERE OUR STRIPES ARE GONNA BE. I'M GONNA MARK ALL THAT OUT, AND THEN CHARLES IS GONNA FOLLOW BEHIND ME AND START LAYING OUT THE FINE LINE SO WE HAVE ULTRA STRAIGHT AND ULTRA COOL AND ULTRA FAST STRIPES. RACING STRIPES ABSOLUTELY MAKE CARS GO FASTER, AND THIS GUY WANTS A FAST CAR, SO IT HAS TO HAVE RACING STRIPES. IT'S NICE TO KEEP MY GUYS FED AND, YOU KNOW, KEEP THEM HAPPY. BUT THIS WAS REALLY JUST TO ENTICE YOU TO GET THE JOB DONE, AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE THE DONUT. I'LL TAKE THIS DOWN AT THIS END. THIS IS LIKE A CARROT FOR THE HORSE. - GOT IT. - WE PUT LSD IN OUR DONUTS. CHARLES. YES, SIR. THESE HOLES ARE A LITTLE WEIRD. DO WE HAVE THE EMBLEM THAT GOES IN THERE, JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T LOOK STUPID? WE MEASURED OFF THE CENTER OF THE BODY FOR THIS STUFF, RIGHT? YEAH. WE MEASURED FROM THE EDGE OF THE BODY TO THE CENTER. GREAT. THAT DOES NOT LINE UP. YEAH, THAT SUCKS. I GUESS I'M NOT GETTING THE REST OF MY DONUT NOW. THESE HOLES ARE A LITTLE WEIRD? DO WE HAVE THE EMBLEM THAT GOES IN THERE? THAT DOES NOT LINE UP. YEAH, THAT SUCKS. SO, AS I'M TAPING OFF THE REAR STRIPES ON THE TRIUMPH, I NOTICE THE FACTORY MOUNT HOLES FOR THE EMBLEM ARE A LITTLE OFF-CENTERED -- NOT EXACTLY A TRIUMPH, MORE LIKE A FAIL. SO, ARE YOU SURE THAT WE HAVE THESE STRIPES IN THE CENTER. THE STRIPES ARE CENTERED. THIS IS PROBABLY A QUARTER-INCH OFF. IF WE TRY TO MOVE THE STRIPE TO CENTER IT ON THIS, IT'S GONNA LOOK OFF... THE WHOLE CAR -- YEAH, 'CAUSE IT -- WELL, THE STRIPE'S GONNA RUN. THE TRUNK LID LATCHES HERE. IT'S GONNA THROW THAT OFF. WHAT IF WE WELD THESE THREE HOLES UP, DO A LITTLE REPAIR THERE, PRIMER, AND HOPEFULLY, KEEP THAT REPAIR SUPER SMALL TO WHERE WE CAN COME BACK IN AND JUST STILL SPRAY THE STRIPE COLOR? WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS, WE HAVE TO SPRAY GRAY BACK DOWN IN THAT AREA. I MEAN, IT'S GONNA SUCK 'CAUSE WE'RE WELDING A CAR THAT'S ALREADY HALFWAY THROUGH THE PAINT PROCESS. BUT I MEAN, I THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. WE NEVER TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT. I WOULDN'T CALL IT "THE EASY WAY OUT." APPARENTLY, THE HOLES FOR THIS EMBLEM WERE DRILLED AT ABOUT 4:30 ON A FRIDAY, IN 1962, 'CAUSE THEY'RE CROOKED. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IF YOU DON'T HAVE RACING STRIPES. BUT AS SOON AS YOU THROW STRIPES ON THERE, IT IS GLARINGLY OBVIOUS THAT IT IS WRONG. SO, WELD THESE HOLES UP, DRILL NEW HOLES, DO A LITTLE BIT OF BODYWORK, A LITTLE BIT OF PRIMER. HOPEFULLY, WE JUST SAND THAT DOWN AND SPRAY THE RED, CLEAR IT. THE REST OF THE CAR'S ALREADY CLEARED, AND THEN WE'RE DONE. ALL RIGHT, THAT LOOKS MUCH BETTER. IT MEASURES OUT FIVE-SIXTEENTHS ON BOTH SIDES. GRIND THE WELDS DOWN, DO A LITTLE BODYWORK, AND PRIME IT UP. ALL RIGHT, DUSTIN. IT'S TIME FOR THE ROLL BAR. HE'S ALREADY BEEN IN ONE ACCIDENT WITH A GIANT SUV. IF THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER ACCIDENT, WANT TO KEEP HIM SAFE. WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO PUT A ROLL BAR IN HERE THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE A CLOTHES RACK. IT'S GOT TO BE EVEN WITH THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. IT CAN'T BE, LIKE, WAY UP HERE. SO, WE BROUGHT IN A BODY DOUBLE. HE'S GOT ONE. AND THAT PERSON IS... I'M GONNA SIT DOWN. YEAH. GET IN THERE. OH, GOD. GET IN HERE. SO, DOUBLE HUMP AROUND THIS HIGH, MAYBE THAT -- YEAH, ABOUT LIKE THAT. BUD, IT'S GOT TO BE LOWER. - HERE? - YEAH. JUST SO I COULD TAKE JUST HIS HAIR OFF WHEN HE ROLLS IT? - YEAH, IT'S PERFECT. - OKAY. DALE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF HAIR UP THERE, SO... OKAY. AND THEN, THE ATTACHMENT POINTS, THAT'S THE OTHER BIG QUESTION. WE ACTUALLY WANT IT TO BE A FUNCTIONING ROLL BAR. YEAH. WE CAN GO RIGHT TO THE FRAME. BUT TO, LIKE, GET IT TO WHERE IT'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW, COMES UP TIGHT, FOLLOWS HIM, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ATTACH HERE, PROBABLY, SOMEWHERE, AND THEN DOWN THROUGH THE FLOOR OVER HERE, AND THEN, PROBABLY, ONE COMING BACK. - SOUNDS GOOD, MAN. - COOL. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR IS, WE'VE GOT PRETTY THIN FLOOR PANS, AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY ALL OFF THE FRAME RAIL. I'VE FABBED UP THESE BRACKETS HERE. WE'RE MOUNTING IT RIGHT OVER THE LEAF-SPRING FRONT-PERCH MOUNT HERE. SO, I'M GONNA ROSETTE-WELD THAT AND THEN MOVE ON TO GETTING A TEMPLATE BUILT FOR OUR MAIN HOOP. THE MAIN HOOP THAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT ONLY A FOUNDATION FOR THE ROLL BAR THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN, BUT IT'S ALSO GONNA ADD STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY TO THE CAR. THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. NOW, IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE FIRST HOOP. THAT'S INTERESTING. ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING? WHAT? ONE BAR? IT'S GONNA LOOK GOOFY AS. - WITH TWO? - I THINK SO. SINGLE HOOP, THE DOUBLE'S GONNA KILL IT. - I'M GOOD WITH THAT, MAN. - ALL RIGHT. I THINK IT'LL LOOK BETTER, TOO. COOL. I'M PUTTING A BACKBAR ON THE MAIN HOOP OF THE CAGE, ALSO. IT'S GONNA BOLT, AND THEN IT'S GONNA GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THE FLOOR. BUT WE'RE TYING IT IN, AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA TRIANGULATE THE MAIN HOOP THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN. WITHOUT A LINE LOCK, YOU HAVE TO BRAKE TORQUE A VEHICLE, WHICH MEANS YOU'RE TRYING TO SPIN THE CRAP OUT OF THE REAR WHEELS, BUT YOU'RE STILL ON THE BRAKES. WITH A LINE LOCK, YOU PUMP THE BRAKES, HIT THE BUTTON, LET OFF THE PEDAL, AND YOU'VE GOT LOCKED UP FRONT WHEELS AND FREE-SPINNING REAR WHEELS. SO, ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT, YOU CAN DO CRAZY BURNOUTS AND GET THOSE TIRES NICE AND HOT. NOW WE'RE GOING TO LOWER HER DOWN AND FIND A PLACE TO MOUNT OUR SWITCH, AND PULL 12 VOLTS TO IT. PERFECT. WORKING ON THE TR3 ENGINE, WHEN I TOOK IT APART, THEY HAD THICK-WELD NUTS ON HERE, AND IT WAS GRINDING ON THE TIMING COVER. BEST CASE IS, WE FIND A 55-YEAR-OLD BRITISH ENGINE PART. WORST CASE IS, THESE NUTS GRIND THROUGH THE TIMING COVER, MAKE A BIG HOLE IN IT, LEAK ALL THE OIL OUT, AND LOCK HIS ENGINE UP. SO, WE ORDERED IN SOME THIN-WALL NUTS, AND I INSTALLED THOSE. AND I'M GONNA SEE HOW THE CLEARANCE IS. WELL, IT CLEARS, BUT IT'S JUST BY A HAIR. I'M GONNA HAVE TO TRIM THAT DOWN RIGHT THERE. IT'S JUST HAIRS AWAY FROM THIS SIDE OF THE TIMING COVER, AND IF IT GRINDS THAT DOWN, WE'RE UP CREEK. LET'S SEE HOW SHE FITS NOW. OH, YEAH. THAT'S THE WAY WE WANT IT TO FIT. WE'VE GOT CLEARANCE NOW, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. ALL I GOT TO DO IS TORQUE THAT BOLT, AND WE'RE READY TO ROCK HER BACK IN THE CAR. DO I MAKE IT HEAVIER? - YOU ALL RIGHT? - CHOP, CHOP. COME ON. BRINGING IT IN. I'D HAVE HELPED YOU, BUT I'M THE STEERING WHEEL. YOU'RE DOING GOOD. CHARLES' NECK IS ABOUT TO FREAKING POP OFF. AW, THE WHEELS WERE TURNED. AW, MAN! WHO DID THAT, THE? OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO PICK UP THE MOTOR AND SET IT IN THERE? PICK YOU UP NOW. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT TO GET THIS ENGINE IN. YOU WANT TO SET THE RACK? SURE. ALL RIGHT. THE MOTOR ON THE TRIUMPH IS FINE, SO THERE'S NO NEED TO REPLACE IT. THAT BEING SAID, I FOUND A REALLY COOL OLD-SCHOOL SUPERCHARGER THAT'LL GIVE IT 30% MORE HORSEPOWER. IN A CAR THIS LIGHT, IT'LL TURN IT INTO A LITTLE ROCKET SHIP. WE PROBABLY START COMING DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT. I WAS GONNA SAY, "COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT." WE GOT TO WATCH THIS BREATHER TUBE, TOO. THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD. SO, THEN, WE GOT THE SHIFTER TO DEAL WITH, HERE. RIGHT. WE'LL GET IT. I THINK, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS, ONCE WE GET THE SHIFTER PAST THE FIREWALL, MAYBE JACK IT UP A LITTLE BIT. OKAY. COME ON IN. I'M TRYING. WATCH THIS HORN... WHOA -- NOW -- OKAY. NOW, GO UP. THERE WE GO. HECK, YEAH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT THE JACK UNDERNEATH IT SO IT DOESN'T GO CRAZY ON US WHEN WE RELEASE THE STRAP. - READY? - YEAH. SO, WHEN WE RELEASE THE STRAP, IT'S GONNA LAND ON THE JACK, AND WE'LL BE GOOD. HERE WE GO. PERFECT. NICE LANDING, GOOSE. WELL, WE GOT THE ENGINE SET IN, STILL GOT TO PUT THE MOUNTS ON. BUT AT LEAST WE DIDN'T SCRATCH NOTHING, TEAR NOTHING UP PUTTING HER IN, WHICH WAS OUR BIGGEST CONCERN. YET. DON'T SAY "YET," PAUL. WE DON'T WANT TO GET JINXED. BUT SO, WE'RE GONNA PUT THE MOUNTS ON IT, START BOLTING HER ON. LATER, SUPERCHARGE INSTALLATION. WELL, WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS ONE KICK ASS. LET'S DO IT. THIS THING'S GONNA LOOK SO BADASS ON THERE. OH, WHAT THE? MAN, IT DON'T FIT. HAD TO TAKE THE HEADER BACK OFF, TOO. NOTHING'S EVER EASY, DOUG. WELCOME TO "LOVE TUNE-UP." "DEAR LOVE TUNE-UP, I'M FALLING REALLY HARD FOR MY NEW BOYFRIEND. HE'S SUPER SWEET, ATHLETIC AND HAS AN AWESOME '69 442. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SOMETIMES, I FEEL HE'S MOVING TOO FAST FOR ME. HOW DO I SLOW HIM DOWN? SINCERELY, JANICE." WELL, JANICE, YOU NEED TO START OFF BY PUTTING SOME REALLY BIG BRAKES UP FRONT, LIKE SIX-PISTON CALIPERS, 13- OR 14-INCH ROTORS. DO THE SAME IN THE REAR, BUT A BIG FOUR-PISTON CALIPER. THEN, YOU NEED TO UPGRADE THE SUSPENSION. THAT WAY, YOU HAVE CONTROL UNDER THESE ABRUPT STOPS. AND THEN, ADD SOME FIVE-POINT HARNESSES, SO YOU FEEL SAFER AT THESE HIGHER SPEEDS. AND IF ALL THIS DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU, MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO JUST RIDE WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED. THANKS. I HOPE THIS HELPS. THIS THING'S GONNA LOOK SO BADASS ON THERE. OH, WHAT THE? MAN, IT DON'T FIT. WE GOT TO DO SOME MODIFYING. HAD TO TAKE THE HEADER BACK OFF, TOO. NOTHING'S EVER EASY, DOUG. YOU KNOW IT. WE'RE STUCK SOMEWHERE. AH, ARE WE HITTING THE BODY DOWN HERE? WELL, WE GOT INTERFERENCE WITH OUR AFTERMARKET HEADER THAT WAS ON THIS TRIUMPH, SO WE EITHER GOT TO MODIFY THE HEADER TUBE OR COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF SUPERCHARGER SPACER TO GET IT OUT AWAY FROM IT. PROBABLY, THE MOST LEGIT FIX IS TO RELOCATE THAT HEADER TUBE A LITTLE BIT. I'M GONNA TAKE THE COMPLETE HEADER OFF, AND WE'LL MODIFY THAT TUBE AND MAKE THIS THING FIT. THE MODIFICATIONS COMPLETE. I'M GONNA PUT IT ON THERE AND BOLT THE SUPERCHARGER OVER IT AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. WELL, WE GOT PLENTY OF CLEARANCE. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE THAT WAY. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT WORSE. SO, WE GOT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HERE, AND HUNDREDS OF AMAZING CARS, ALL TO SHOW OFF OUR BADASS SHOP TRUCK, TIFFANY. WE COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED. WE'VE HAD THAT TRUCK ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, WE'VE NEVER SHOWED IT OFF IN ST. LOUIS. I CAN'T WAIT TO DO SOME SMOKY BURNOUTS. WHAT'S UP, EVERYBODY? THANKS FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT. MY NAME IS NOAH ALEXANDER, WITH CLASSIC CAR STUDIO. SO, ABOUT A YEAR AGO, WE BUILT A CRAZY SHOP TRUCK. HER NAME IS TIFFANY. IT WAS A PROJECT WHERE, WE DIDN'T HAVE A CUSTOMER ON THE TRUCK, SO WE KIND OF JUST DID WHATEVER WE WANTED. EVERY GUY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF INPUT INTO THE PROJECT, AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THE RESULTS ARE FRICKING AWESOME. WE'VE HAD IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, WON SOME COOL AWARDS, BEEN IN A BUNCH OF MAGAZINES. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A PROPER ST. LOUIS HOMECOMING. THANK YOU. COME ON OUT, GIRL. COME ON OUT. OH, YEAH. MOVE, PEOPLE, THIS THING GETS OUT OF WHACK. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. ANYWAY, THIS IS TIFFANY, 1966 CHEVY SHOP TRUCK, BLAZEFRAME ON THE GROUND. WE GOT TWIN NELSON RACING TURBOS. IT MAKES ABOUT 1,000 HORSEPOWER, TON OF CUSTOM METAL. IT FREAKING TURNED OUT AWESOME, SO, YOU GUYS READY FOR A BURNOUT? THERE YOU GO. GET A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. YEAH! - THANK YOU. - GOOD JOB, BUDDY. HOLY, THAT WAS FREAKING AWESOME. EVEN BETTER THAN THE PICKUP TRUCK. WHAT A CRAZY-ASS CROWD OF PEOPLE THAT TURNED OUT TONIGHT. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT. IT'S AN HONOR. LOVE TO OUR ST. LOUIS CAR COMMUNITY. DALE'S PICKING UP THE TRIUMPH TOMORROW, BUT WE KEEP HITTING SPEED BUMP AFTER SPEED BUMP AFTER SPEED BUMP THAT ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF COMPLETING THIS DAMN CAR. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT ONE FENDER ON FOR, LIKE, OVER TWO HOURS. WHY ARE BOTH SIDES MISSING ONE OF THESE? 'CAUSE APPARENTLY, IT HAS NO CAGE NUTS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE OTHER PIECE IS. IF WE CAN FIND A TRUNK LATCH, THAT'D BE GREAT. OH. ALL THE GAUGES GOT TO BE UNDONE TO GET THIS IN THERE. TRYING TO TAKE THE STEERING COLUMN OUT -- DROP IT DOWN, ANYWAY, SO WE CAN GET THE DASHBOARD TO CLIP UNDER. I GOT A PROJECT FOR YOU. I THINK WE WANT TO MOUNT THESE LIKE THESE. ARE YOU KIDDING? WHY DIDN'T WE DO THIS ABOUT FIVE DAYS AGO? SO, HERE IT IS. IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT, AND WE'VE GOT ONE LAST DETAIL TO DO ON THIS CAR. IT'S GONNA, YOU KNOW, INVOLVE A LITTLE BIT OF FABRICATION FOR SCOTT, BUT WE'RE BASICALLY GOING TO HANG THE FOG LIGHTS OFF OF A LICENSE-PLATE BRACKET. IT'S GONNA BE A DUAL-PURPOSE-TYPE BRACKET. AND I THINK, IN THE END, IT'S GONNA TURN OUT REALLY NICE. THERE'S A BIG GAP IN THE FRONT. SORRY, GUYS. THIS CAR IS FIGHTING US ALL THE WAY. IT JUST... WELL, FOR ONE THING, IT'S PROBABLY 3:00 OR 4:00 IN THE MORNING RIGHT NOW. WE'RE ALL TIRED. - YOU KNOW WHAT? - WHAT'S UP, BUD? IT WOULD STICK A LOT BETTER IF I GLUED IT. I'M PROBABLY BEING WAY PICKIER THAN WHAT THE FACTORY EVER WAS. THIS STUFF NEVER FIT WORTH A CRAP, ANYWAYS. LITTLE CAR, BIG PAIN IN THE ASS. SO, DALE ASKED ME TO MEET HIM AT THE AIRPORT WITH HIS TRIUMPH. BUT LITTLE DOES HE KNOW, AS SOON AS HE LANDS, I'VE GOT THE AIRPORT CLOSED DOWN ALL DAY, AND WE CAN DRIVE IT RIGHT THERE. WELL, THERE HE IS. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - HEY, NOAH, MADE IT. - HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD, BUDDY. HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. WHAT'S YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION? WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, MY GOD. IT'S AMAZING. YOU KNOW, I SAW IT FROM THE AIR. I COULDN'T HARDLY BELIEVE THAT, THAT WAS MY CAR. IT IS YOUR CAR. SO, WITH THE PAINT, WE ADDED SOME MORE METAL FLAKE, THREE COATS OF BASE, FIVE COATS OF CLEAR. YOU KNOW, THAT SILVER, I THINK, WITH THAT RED, AND THE WAY THAT RED POPS, I THINK, IS FABULOUS. ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE COMPLETELY, YOU KNOW, REBUILT FROM THE GROUND UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHEELS? OH, THE WHEELS ARE PERFECT. WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THE KNOCKOFF STYLE, BUT IT'S A PERFORMANCE WHEEL, AND IT'S GOT A REAL RACY LOOK, WHICH WE'RE A HUGE FAN OF. I'M JUST SO SURPRISED. DO YOU LIKE IT WITHOUT THE WINDSHIELD? YOU KNOW, WITHOUT THE WINDSHIELD, IT'S VERY NOSTALGIC. IT FEELS LIKE A LITTLE RACER, AND IT JUST LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FUN. WE LOOKED AT A TON OF RACE CARS, A LOT OF DIFFERENT ROLL BAR STYLES, AND DUSTIN HELPED DESIGN THIS ONE -- REALLY NICE, ELEGANT. WE GOT LUCAS FOG LIGHTS ON THE FRONT. SO, ON THE INTERIOR, ALL NEW CARPETING, WE'VE GOT SOUND DEADENING. IT'S A MUCH BETTER-CONSTRUCTED CAR, NOW. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE. WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE PERFORMANCE STUFF YET, SO, WANT TO LOOK AT THE ENGINE? I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT. THERE WAS ONLY ONE ON THE MARKET AT THIS TIME. IT'S A COMPLETELY REBUILT JUDSON SUPERCHARGER. YEAH, SO WE ADDED 30% MORE HORSEPOWER. 30%? - YEAH. - WELL, THAT'S A LOT. THE THING SOUNDS GREAT, PULLS HARD, MAKES GREAT POWER. READY TO ROCK AND ROLL. - READY FOR A SPIN? - WE ARE READY FOR A SPIN. WHO'S DRIVING, YOU OR I? YOU CAN DRIVE. OH, THAT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT? OH, YEAH. YEAH. IT FEELS GOOD. YEAH. WOW. WELL, NOAH... - WHAT DO YOU THINK? - I LOVE IT. GREAT. IT RUNS ITS ASS OFF. IT DRIVES BEAUTIFUL. COOL. WELL, I GUESS WE'LL TAKE IT BACK TO THE SHOP, AND YOU CAN PICK IT UP NEXT WEEK SOMETIME. JUST LET US KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO COME IN. OKAY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I'M GONNA TAKE THIS, AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY HOME. I THINK I GOT AN IDEA. OH, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I CAN'T TELL YOU YET, BUT ENJOY YOUR CAR. OH, YEAH? - THANK YOU. - YOU GOT IT, NOAH. - ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU. OKAY. I'M GONNA GET ON THE PLANE. HOO, HOO, HOO, HOO, HOO, HOO, HOO. OH, THIS IS NICER THAN THE TRIUMPH. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
