 WHAT'S GOING ON, DALE? - WHAT'S UP, MAN? - HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD, AND YOURSELF? - DOING WELL. GOOD TO SEE YOU. - WHAT'S UP, DALE? - HOW YOU DOING, MAN? - WHAT'S UP, BUDDY? - WHAT'S HAPPENING? - HOW YOU DOING, MAN? BROUGHT ONE IN, HUH? I FOUND THIS '31 FORD UP IN WISCONSIN. ♪♪ SO DALE HAS BROUGHT US A 1931 MODEL A. BACK WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED HOT RODDING THESE CARS, THEY WERE SUPER, SUPER CHEAP TO BUY. YOU CUT THEM UP, YOU MADE THEM YOUR OWN, AND YOU MADE THEM FAST. SO, FOR US, THAT KIND OF LINES UP WITH WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY HERE AT CLASSIC CAR STUDIO. IT'S ALSO A GREAT PIECE OF HOT RODDING HISTORY. SO, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT ON TOUR RIGHT NOW. WHEN DO YOU GUYS GO OUT NEXT? YEAH, MAN, SEETHER IS ON A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK RIGHT NOW. SO, IN YOUR TIME OFF, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING FUN TO DRIVE. A FUN TOUR IS EASIER WHEN YOU HAVE A LITTLE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.RIGHT. AND, YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S SOMETHING COOL LIKE THIS TO LOOK FORWARD TO... I RESPECT WHAT YOU GUYS DO, AND, YOU KNOW, I LOVE EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE SO FAR, SO. WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN THIS CAR? MAN, I NEED A HOT ROD IN MY LIFE. SO YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF CRAZY SPORTS CAR FEEL. YOU WANT TO BUILD A STRAIGHT-UP HOT ROD? YEAH, MAN. I JUST WANT SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, I CAN TAKE LIGHT TO LIGHT... RIGHT....AND MAKE A LOT OF NOISE. I WANT IT TO LOOK A LITTLE MEAN. I WANT IT TO HAVE AN ATTITUDE, YOU KNOW? SO YOU GOING, LIKE, FULL-BLOWN OPEN WHEEL HOT ROD, NO FENDERS, GREAT BIG MOTOR? YEAH. SOMETHING LOUD. JUST, YOU KNOW, BIG WHEELS AT THE BACK. GIVE IT THAT SORT OF FORWARD RAKE. I WANT TO SEE THE ENGINE AS WELL. - ALL RIGHT. - YEAH, THAT'S COOL. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO HEAR THAT ENGINE TOO. YOU WANT TO SEE THE ENGINE, OR YOU WANT TO SEE AROUND THE ENGINE? I WANT TO SEE AROUND IT.ALL RIGHT, COOL. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE KIND OF CAR THAT'S MEANT TO BE, YOU KNOW, TOO COMFORTABLE TO DRIVE. YOU KNOW, YOU WANT IT TO RIDE A LITTLE BIT HARD. YOU KNOW, YOU WANT THE STEERING TO BE A LITTLE BIT HEAVY. YOU WANT IT TO BE A LITTLE CLUNKY GOING INTO THE GEARS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S PART OF ITS CHARM. Noah: I'M PICTURING KIND OF A RAW METAL CAR. AND THEN MAYBE CHOOSE AN ACCENT COLOR, DO THE MOTOR IN THAT COLOR. Charles: HOW ABOUT A HEMI? HEMI IS GOOD.AN OLD HEMI. Noah: MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A PRETTY BADASS BUILD ON OUR HANDS. ABSOLUTELY. YOU GUYS WANT TO LOOK AT THE INTERIOR REAL QUICK? SO WOULD WE BE ABLE TO KEEP THE WOOD? BECAUSE I KIND OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT SORT OF OLD-SCHOOL ASPECT OF THE WOOD. INITIALLY, I WAS THINKING KIND OF LIKE A BARE METAL OUTSIDE AND A BARE METAL, LIKE, REAL RAW LOOK. AND THE WOOD COULD ACTUALLY PLAY INTO THAT. BUT THEN WHAT I WAS THINKING IS IF WE COULD ACTUALLY RECREATE THIS STRUCTURE IN REALLY, REALLY NICE HARDWOOD. YOU KNOW, IT'S GOT THAT REALLY BADASS RAW METAL LOOK, AND THEN THE WOOD KIND OF COULD BE OUR LEVEL OF REFINEMENT. IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY RAUNCHY. PRETTY RAW, YEAH. YEAH. SO A LOT OF GUYS HOT ROD THESE MODEL As, BUT DALE'S CAR IS GOING TO BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WE'VE GOT A HUGE HEMI UP FRONT WITH A BLOWER ON IT, COMPLETELY ONE-OFF METAL INTERIOR AND A HARDWOOD ROOF THAT'S GOING TO REALLY SET IT APART. THIS THING IS GOING TO HAVE THE STYLE AND BE STUPID FAST. I THINK WE GOT SOME GOOD DIRECTION. AND WE'LL LET SCOTT RUN AWAY WITH IT. WE'LL MAKE IT COOL. I WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE COOL OLD GUYS. I DON'T WANT TO AGE GRACEFULLY. I WANT TO GO OUT IN A FIREBALL OF GASOLINE AND SMOKE AND, "HE DIED DOING WHAT HE LOVED, YOU KNOW, RACING HIS HOT ROD DOWN THE STREET." ♪♪ WE DON'T GET MANY HOT RODS IN HERE, SO I'M EXCITED TO GET THIS CAR TORN DOWN AND STRIPPED TO BARE METAL SO WE CAN GET STARTED ON THE REAL STUFF. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. ♪♪ ♪♪ SO WE'RE ON ONE HELL OF A FIELD TRIP TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING OUT TO BUY A VINTAGE 331 HEMI. WE DECIDED TO GO WITH THIS 331 HEMI BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR THIS CAR. IF YOU GO WITH A NEWER HEMI, THEY'RE CUT DIFFERENTLY. IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF ENGINE. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALUMINUM HEADS. IT DOESN'T LOOK VINTAGE AT ALL, AND THAT JUST, IN MY MIND, IT WOULD RUIN THE WHOLE LOOK OF THE CAR. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOUR PROBLEM IS. IT'S THE COOLEST THING YOU COULD EVER HAVE. ♪♪ HOW'S IT GOING, DAVE? HOW YOU DOING, CHARLES? NICE TO MEET YOU. MARK. HEY. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. HOW YOU GUYS DOING TODAY? GOOD. REAL GOOD. MAN, YOU GOT ALL KINDS OF COOL STUFF AROUND HERE. I DIDN'T EXPECT TO WALK IN AND SEE THAT. YOU'VE GOT ENGINES EVERYWHERE. YOU'VE GOT THIS ONE, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. ABSOLUTELY.RIGHT? SO THIS IS THE ONE THAT I CALLED ABOUT. IT IS. THE 331. 331.WHAT YEAR IS THIS MOTOR? DO YOU KNOW, BY CHANCE? THAT IS A 1956. '56, OKAY, COOL. SO IT'S NOT THE EARLIER ONE WITH THE EXTENDED BELL HOUSING. NO.IT'S THE SHORT HOUSING... CORRECT.... OR THE SHORT BLOCK, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS GOOD.RIGHT, EXACTLY. WE'RE PUTTING IT IN A MODEL A, SO IT'S GOING TO BE... IT'S A VERY SMALL ENGINE THEN. WELL, LET'S GET THIS THING LOADED UP. ALL RIGHT.I'M EXCITED. SOUNDS GOOD.I'LL MOVE THE TRUCK IN HERE. [ ENGINE STARTS ] I THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE TAILGATE. WELL, HEY, THANKS, DAVE, APPRECIATE IT. MARK, NICE TO MEET YOU.GOOD TO MEET YOU. YEAH. THANKS. AH, I REALLY HATE TO SEE THAT MOTOR GO. ♪♪ ♪♪ CHECK THIS THING OUT, MAN. HARDLY ANY RUST AT ALL. LOOK AT THAT, JUST A LITTLE BIT IN THE COWL. THE MODEL A JUST CAME BACK FROM MEDIA BLASTING. I'M HAPPY THAT WE HAVE SUCH A PRISTINE BODY TO START WITH. THANK GOD BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK WE NEED TO DO ON THIS CAR. Scott: WE'RE GETTING READY TO BUILD A MODEL A, AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A CUSTOM CHASSIS BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THIS IS GOING TO BE SO EXTREMELY CHOPPED AND CHANNELED AND CUSTOM THAT NOTHING OFF THE SHELF IS GOING TO FIT. THERE'S TWO THINGS TO CREATING A CHASSIS. THE MAIN ONE IS HOW LONG YOUR WHEEL BASE IS GOING TO BE, AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS YOUR RIDE HEIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY CHANNEL THE BODY OVER THE CHASSIS TO SET THE BODY REALLY LOW. THE AXLE IS MADE TO RIDE UNDERNEATH ON A NORMAL MODEL A. NOW OUR AXLE IS GOING TO BE ACTUALLY UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY. SO WHAT I GOT TO DO IS GET THE WHEELS AND TIRES ON THE READ END AND SET THE BODY OVER THAT REAR AXLE AND CRIB IT UP AT 4 INCHES OF RIDE HEIGHT, AND THEN WE'LL KNOW EXACTLY HOW FAR UP THAT REAR END IS GOING TO BE INSIDE THAT BODY. SO AT THAT RIDE HEIGHT, THAT'S 4 1/2 INCHES THE WAY I GOT IT SET UP. YOU THINK THAT'S COOL, OR YOU WANT TO GO LOWER, OR... I THINK THAT'S COOL. THE BACK END IS GOING TO COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, HOW LOW CAN YOU GO? ALL RIGHT. SO I'LL COME BACK IN A LITTLE BIT, AND THEN WE'LL GET THE OTHER PARTS IN HERE AND START LOOKING AT WHEEL BASES. YEP. AWESOME. COOL. ♪♪ FRONT AXLE ON A MODEL A IS YOUR FRONT AXLE AND YOUR FRONT SUSPENSION ALL BUILT INTO ONE, AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS KIND OF LIKE A SPLIT WISHBONE SUICIDE FRONT END IS WHAT THEY CALL IT, WHERE THE SPRING IS ACTUALLY THROWN BACK BEHIND THE FRONT AXLE. THROWING THAT AXLE OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT JUST GETS A LOWER RIDE HEIGHT, A BETTER STANCE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN AGGRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FRONT END. WE'LL PUT THE WHOLE BRAKE BACKING PLATE AND BRAKES AND ALL ON? BECAUSE THIS AIN'T NO BOLT PATTERN NEITHER IS IT? YEAH, IT IS. FIVE ON 4 1/2? OH, NO, IT'S FIVE ON 5 1/2. HOW WE GOING TO PUT FRONT WHEELS ON? OUR BRAKES AIN'T GOOD. WE NEED ADAPTERS. SO WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF MOCKING UP THE FRONT END ON THIS MODEL A, AND THE HUBS THAT WE HAVE ARE FIVE ON 5 1/2 BOLT PATTERN, BUT THE WHEELS THAT WE HAVE ARE FIVE ON 4 1/2, SO THAT WHEEL IS NOT GOING ON THAT HUB. IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A HOLDUP NOW BECAUSE WE GOT TO SEND THE HUBS OUT AND GET THEM RE-DRILLED. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THIS COULD DELAY THE START OF THE CHASSIS BUILD FOR ANOTHER COUPLE DAYS. ♪♪ I'M PUTTING THE WHEELS ON THE FRONT OF THE MODEL A, AND THE WHEEL HUBS AND THE WHEEL ARE TWO DIFFERENT BOLT PATTERNS. THEY WON'T MATE UP. SO CHARLES IS GOING TO TAKE THE HUBS OUT TO A MACHINE SHOP AND HAVE THE BOLT PATTERN PUT TOGETHER, SO, DOWN THE ROAD, EVERYTHING WILL BE JUST PERFECT, BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE THE TIME NOR THE PATIENCE TO WAIT FOR THAT, SO I'M GOING TO TRY AND STEAL SOMETHING OFF OF ANOTHER CAR SO I CAN KEEP THIS PROJECT GOING. WHAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WON'T HURT THEM. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ KNOCK, KNOCK. HEY, WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP, DUDE? COMING IN TO CHECK ON THE CAR? NO, NO. WHAT? I'M NOT. I'M NOT. I JUST... ACTUALLY, I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. I WANT IT TO BE A SURPRISE.JUST NOT LOOKING. I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT UNTIL, LIKE, IT'S TIME. UNTIL IT'S TIME, OKAY. BUT I WANT TO RUN SOMETHING BY YOU. SO I'VE BEEN REALLY GETTING EXCITED ABOUT THE WHOLE CAR THING.THAT'S GOOD. AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD MAYBE PAINT MY BASS GUITAR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. HOLY SMOKES, CHECK THIS OUT. THIS IS AWESOME. YEAH, MAN. THAT'S ACTUALLY MY SIGNATURE MODEL. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. AND I KNOW YOU DON'T NORMALLY DO, LIKE, BASSES. HEY. I DON'T KNOW, I LOVE YOUR PAINT JOBS. I LOVE WHAT YOU DO. I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD DO SOMETHING COOL. I'M SURE WE CAN.IF YOU'RE WILLING. YES.I LOVE THESE SPARKLES, MAN. YEAH. MAYBE YOU CAN ADD A LITTLE FLASH ON THERE. THE ANSWER IS YES. I WOULD LOVE TO PAINT A GUITAR. YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I DON'T DO THAT ALL THE TIME. I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL? YOUR CAR IS NOT GOING TO HAVE PAINT. WE GOT TO PAINT SOMETHING. SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE. WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF HERE? THIS INLAYS ACTUALLY ON THE FRETBOARD HERE ARE -- THEY'RE TAKEN FROM THE TATTOO ON THE BACK OF MY NECK HERE. OKAY. THAT'S AWESOME.KIND OF LIKE A DRAGON THEME. FLAKE ON THIS GUITAR WOULD LOOK AWESOME. SOMETHING THAT, LIKE, UNDER THE LIGHTS, IT JUST POPS, YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING. YEAH, LET'S BLIND PEOPLE. YES. YOU'LL MAKE THEM BLIND AND MAKE THEM DEAF AT THE SAME TIME. I'LL MAKE THEM WISH THEY NEVER CAME OUT. WELL, IT'LL BE A TWIST.DO YOUR MAGIC, MAN. I TRUST YOUR JUDGEMENT. AWESOME. WE'LL GET IT DONE. ALL RIGHT.SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT. ♪♪ WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? WE GOT BILLET HUBS NOW? BADASS STREET ROD. HIGH-TECH CREDIT CARD CAR. SO WE WENT FROM DRILLING TO STEALING. [ LAUGHS ]WHERE'D YOU STEAL THIS? WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS STAY ON SCHEDULE, SO I COULD USE THESE... THAT'S GOOD, BUT WHICH CAR DID YOU STEAL THEM OFF OF? HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT ONE THAT NEEDS TO LEAVE SOON. A GOOD THIEF DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT HE STOLE. BRAND-NEW ROTORS. YEAH, WE CAN RETURN THEM. I DON'T NEED THEM. BUT, LOOK, THESE GOT THE CHEVY AND FORD PATTERN, SO, BAM, I SWITCHED THEM OVER TO FORD, SO NOW THE GUY I TOOK THEM FROM... SO YOU JUST DECIDED NOT TO DRILL THEM AND JUST -- THE GUY I TOOK THEM FROM, HE AIN'T GOING TO KNOW I TOOK THEM BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG BOLT PATTERN. BUT THAT'LL KEEP THE A BUILD GOING ON SCHEDULE BECAUSE WE CAN USE THESE FOR MOCK-UP, BUT THAT RIGHT THERE IS GOING TO SAVE THE DAY FOR US RIGHT NOW. WELL, LET'S MOCK IT UP THEN. LET'S PUT THE WHEELS ON SO NOBODY SEES OUR PARTS. SOMEBODY STEALS IT? YEAH. STEALS IT BACK? OR, WAIT, IF THEY STEAL IT BACK, IS IT STEALING? YEAH, IT'S STEALING. IT'S OURS RIGHT NOW. ♪♪ Charles: COOL. LET'S ROLL THIS FRONT END UNDERNEATH THERE. SO WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE MEASURING OUT THE WHEEL BASE FOR THE MODEL A CHASSIS. BEFORE WE START BUILDING THE CHASSIS, WE NEED TO GET THE WHEEL BASE RIGHT. WHAT IS IT? Scott: 110 AND A HALF. STOCK IS 103. OH, GOD. WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE CAR LOOK TOO LONG AND RIDICULOUS, SO WE'RE GOING TO GET THE MOTOR PUSHED BACK AS FAR AS WE CAN, PULL THE WHEELS BACK AS CLOSE AS WE CAN. WE REALLY WANT TO GET AS CLOSE TO THE STOCK WHEEL BASE MEASUREMENT AS POSSIBLE, BUT IT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE SOME CREATIVITY TO GET THERE. YEAH, WE DEFINITELY GOT TO SHORTEN IT UP. YEAH. PUSH THE MOTOR BACK INTO THE COWL, KNOCKING THIS BACK. THAT'S GOING TO GAIN US ANOTHER 4. THAT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN I THOUGHT. THAT'S 4. SO IF WE MOVE THE FIREWALL BACK 4 INCHES, IT'S GOING TO CRAMP UP THE DRIVER COMPARTMENT A LITTLE BIT, BUT IF WE PUSH THE SEAT BACK AS FAR AS POSSIBLE UP AGAINST THE REAR SUSPENSION, IT'S GOING TO BUY US SOME SPACE THAT WAY. THIS CAR IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A REAR SEAT, OBVIOUSLY, ANYMORE. AND THEN WE'LL DO SWING PEDALS, YOU KNOW, MAYBE DOWN FROM THE DASH, UNDERNEATH THE DASH. THAT'LL GIVE US A LITTLE MORE ROOM. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER TIME WE BUILD A CUSTOM CAR. TO GET THAT LOOK, THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF CUTTING INVOLVED. I'M READY. ALL RIGHT. COOL. YOU READY TO CUT IT? CUT HER UP. CUT IT UP. ♪♪ ♪♪ YES. ♪♪ I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT BACK THE MAX WE CAN GET IT BACK BECAUSE OF THE BLOWER THAT'S GOING ON HERE IS GOING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL 3 INCHES TO THE FRONT, AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE FRONT OF THE CAR AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE FACTORY MODEL A HAD A REALLY SHORT NOSE. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WE JAMMED THIS BIG MOTOR IN THAT FACTORY MODEL A SPOT. ♪♪ ON A LOT OF HOT RODS WE BUILD AROUND HERE, WE WILL OUTSOURCE A HOT ROD CHASSIS, BUT THERE'S A DOWNTIME THAT COMES WITH THAT. COULD BE 3, 4 MONTHS, SOMETIMES LONGER. ON THIS CAR HERE, WE DON'T HAVE THAT TIME TO WAIT. WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE THIS CHASSIS IN-HOUSE ALL OURSELVES, AND WHEN WE'RE DONE, WE CAN SAY IT IS 100 PERCENT OUR CAR. SOME GRAB ASS. GET THE HEAVY END. - YEAH, OH, MAN. - TOUGH GUY. - HOLD UP, HOLD UP, HOLD UP. - OH, HEY. THAT WAS GRACEFUL. ALL RIGHT. SO WE GOT THE MODEL A BLOWN APART. WE GOT THE FRONT AND THE REAR AXLE UP ON THE JIG TABLE. SO NOW WHAT I GOT TO DO IS BUILD A BUNCH OF LITTLE FIXTURES TO HOLD THE REAR END IN PLACE, HOLD THE FRONT END IN PLACE, AND THAT'LL STAY THERE, WELDED TO THE TABLE, AND THEN WE'LL START CONNECTING THE DOTS WITH FRAME RAILS. ♪♪ THAT'S LOOKING PRETTY SEXY OVER THERE. SO WE GOT THE FRONT AND REAR AXLES ALL MEASURED UP AND TACK-WELDED TO THE TABLE. NOW IT'S THE FUN PART, BUILDING THE CHASSIS. ♪♪ ♪♪ SPARK-TACULAR. SO, ON THE MODEL A CHASSIS, WE'RE CRUISING RIGHT ALONG. WE'VE GOT THE LOWER RAILS MADE. THEY PINCH ALONG AND FOLLOW THE BODY REALLY NICE. SO THEN WE WENT TO THE BACK CRADLE. WE CALL THAT THE SUSPENSION CRADLE. IT'S GOT THE ZEED UP, HAS TO GET UP REALLY HIGH TO GET OVER THE REAR END BECAUSE ALL THE SUSPENSION IS RAISED UP INSIDE THE CAR. THEN IT'LL HAVE THE COILOVER MOUNTS, ALL THE FOUR-LINK MOUNTS. NOW, ONCE THIS IS ALL FLOOR- PANNED IN INSIDE IN THE CAR, THIS WILL ACTUALLY BE THE SEATING AREA RIGHT HERE, RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SUSPENSION AND THE ARM REST ON THE DRIVESHAFT. SO EVERYTHING IS WAY UP INSIDE THIS CAR. THAT'S THE SQUARE BEYOND COMPARE RIGHT THERE. ♪♪ - IT'S COMING. - MUCH BETTER. WATCH YOUR HEAD. ♪♪ - COOL. - GOOD? - YEAH. THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. Scott: SO NOW THAT THE AXLE IS ACTUALLY INSIDE THE BODY ON THE MODEL A, NOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD, SET UP THE FRONT AXLE. ON THE FRONT, I WANT TO TAKE THE FRONT FRAME RAILS AND TAPER THEM ALL THE WAY DOWN UNDERNEATH THE LEAF SPRING, BUILD THE MOUNT AND THEN HAVE EVERYTHING HIDDEN BEHIND THE GRILL SHELL. ♪♪ THAT'S NICE. ♪♪ WE'RE GOING TO NEED THIS AND THIS. THE REAR OF THE MODEL A, WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUSPENSION, I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO GO WITH A TRIANGULATED FOUR-LINK WITH COILOVERS. HERE WE GO. ♪♪ ♪♪ GOING TO TEST-FIT THESE. ♪♪ ♪♪ COILOVER IS ACTUALLY ADJUSTABLE ON THE REBOUND AND THE DAMPENER, SO WE CAN TIGHTEN THIS ALL UP TO WHERE IT'S REALLY STIFF AND THE CAR WON'T SQUAT AND WANT TO LAUNCH, AND IT'LL DO A REALLY GOOD BURNOUT, OR IF WE'RE REALLY WANTING TO TRY TO GET IT TO GRIP AND TAKE OFF, WE CAN LIGHTEN IT UP AND DIAL IT IN THAT WAY AS WELL. NOT TO MENTION IT MAKES IT GREAT FOR DAILY DRIVING ROAD USE. ♪♪ BADA-BINGO. YOU LIKE IT? SO OUR CLIENT, DALE, ASKED US TO CUSTOMIZE ONE OF HIS BASSES. AND SINCE THE MODEL A ISN'T ACTUALLY GETTING ANY PAINT, HE ASKED CHARLES TO SLAP SOME PAINT ON HIS BASS GUITAR. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT CHARLES IS A REALLY, REALLY TALENTED PAINTER. READY TO ROCK AND ROLL. WELL, NOT REALLY. READY FOR PAINT. ♪♪ ♪♪ ON DALE'S BASS GUITAR, I CHOSE A RED AND GOLD FLAKE COMBO TO GIVE IT THAT '60s HOT ROD CUSTOM LOOK. SO UNDERNEATH THE STAGE LIGHTS, THIS THING OUGHT TO POP. ♪♪ [ DISCORDANT NOTES PLAY ] WHOA. IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I PLAYED LIKE THAT. ANYWAY, I LOVE IT. I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT TURNED OUT. I LIKE THE COLOR SCHEME. YOU KNOW, THE FLAKE IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG DEAL FOR ME. I THINK IT'S COOL. THIS IS MY GUITAR NOW. I'M GOING TO PLAY WITH SEETHER, SO YOU WON'T SEE ME AROUND FOR A WHILE. DALE IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THINGS HERE, SO IT'LL BE A GOOD TIME FOR HIM AND FOR ME. ♪♪ TRANSMISSION IS HERE FOR THE MODEL A, SO GOT TO GET AN ADAPTER PLATE ON THE HEMI AND BOLT THIS THING UP SO WE CAN GET IT IN THE CAR. ♪♪ WHEW! THANKS, FRIEND. ♪♪ NOW THAT WE HAVE THE ENGINE, TRANSMISSION AND BLOWER, IT'S UP TO SCOTT AND RANDY TO MAKE A BLOWN HEMI FIT IN A PLACE NORMALLY RESERVED FOR A FOUR-CYLINDER 40-HORSEPOWER ENGINE. REASON WHY I'M GOING FORWARD AS MUCH AS WE CAN IS TO CREATE MORE FLOOR ROOM BECAUSE THE TRANNY IS SO BIG AND SO INSIDE THE CAR. AND VERY HIGH UP. AT THAT, THAT RIGHT THERE, THE OIL PAN IS ABOVE THE FRAME RAIL, SO IF WE WERE TO BOTTOM OUT THE FRAME RAILS ON A SPEED BUMP... SAFE. ...THE OIL PAN, TRANSMISSION PAN, ALL YOUR IMPORTANT **** CLEARS, AND YOU JUST SLIDE THE FRAME RAILS. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE ENGINE FITTING, IT'S TIME TO INSTALL THE 671 BLOWER. THIS THING IS GOING TO SCREAM HOT ROD. YOU GOT IT? HOO! I GUESS. YOU CAN CURL THIS THING. SO, ORIGINALLY, THE 331 HEMI ONLY HAD ABOUT 235 HORSEPOWER. NOW, WE BOUGHT THIS MOTOR COMPLETELY REBUILT, WHICH IS A GOOD THING, AND, WITH THE BLOWER RIDING ON TOP, IT SHOULD MAKE ABOUT 500 HORSEPOWER, QUITE THE HOT ROD INCREASE. 1.15. WE'RE GETTING THERE. 9.0. DUDE, I'M NOT LYING TO YOU WHEN I TELL YOU IT'S ALL SNAKE-EYES. RIGHT? THAT'S INCREDIBLE. ♪♪ CHASSIS IS DONE. THE SUSPENSION FITS. THE MOTOR AND TRANSMISSION IS INSTALLED. I'M OFF TO GET NOAH AND CHARLES AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY FEEL ABOUT THIS BADASS BUILD. Noah: THIS THING IS GOING TO BE FREAKING INCREDIBLE. THAT'S COOL. EVERYTHING WE DO FROM HERE FORWARD IS JUST GOING TO BE HOT, JUST GOING TO ADD TO IT. YEAH. HE'S GOING TO GO ON TOUR RIGHT AFTER HE GETS THIS CAR TOO. THAT'S GOING TO KILL HIM. Randy: HE AIN'T GOING TO WANT TO LEAVE. WELL, HE COULD LEAVE THE CAR HERE SO WE COULD DO THE BREAK-IN. - THAT'S RIGHT. - YEAH. - GOOD POINT. - ALL RIGHT. WELL, GOOD JOB ON THE CHASSIS, GUYS. IT LOOKS GREAT.LOT OF HARD WORK. ♪♪ SO, FROM THE BEGINNING, CHARLES AND I HAD THE IDEA TO DO A CUSTOM WOOD ROOF ON THE MODEL A. AND SINCE MOST OF THE GUYS ARE METAL MONKEYS, WE DECIDED TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE HAND. I JUST DON'T THINK A LOT OF THE THINGS WE DO AROUND HERE ARE APPRECIATED THOUGH. OH. WE'RE GETTING THE WOOD OFF. YOU GUYS ARE SO SLOW WE HAD TO COME OUT AND HELP YOU. IT'S RATHER GENEROUS OF SCOTT TO LET US USE HIS -- HIS TOOLS? NOEY, YOU SHOULD TRY THIS HOLE PUNCHER TOOL. IT'S COOL. YOU COULD DO THIS FROM YOUR OFFICE CHAIR. I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO TAKE A NAP. THEY'RE NOT DONE WITH THAT YET? CAN YOU BE DONE WITH THAT BY FRIDAY? ♪♪ WHOA. [ WHISTLES ] ♪♪ [ BLEEP ] **** YOU. BETTER PRACTICE ON BEING SAFE. THAT'S GOING TO HURT MORE THAN YOUR AVERAGE PAPER CUT. ♪♪ WHOA. STARTING IT ON FIRE. WOO-HOO! WHOA, YOU BURNED IT UP. HEY, SOMETHING IS ON FIRE OVER THERE. IT'S YOUR PAYCHECK. ALL RIGHT. LOOKS GOOD. WE ARE PROFESSIONAL WOOD-SLINGERS. WE SAVED SCOTT A LOT OF TIME, WAS OVER THERE TALKING ****. WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DOCK HIS PAY FOR THAT. I'LL GET MARTIN OVER HERE, GET THIS THING MEASURED, FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CURVE IS, AND HE CAN START MAKING THOSE PIECES. I THINK THIS THING IS GOING TO LOOK FREAKING AWESOME. NEXT TIME THEY NEED OUR HELP, THEY JUST NEED TO COME TO THE OFFICE AND ASK. ALL THEY GOT TO DO IS ASK. YEAH, WE'RE JUST A COUPLE STEPS AWAY. ♪♪ SO, ON THE MODEL A, I WANT THESE WHEELS TO HAVE A REALLY CLEAN ONE-OFF LOOK. SO WE BOUGHT SOME 18-INCH STEEL WHEELS. WE'RE GOING TO WELD UP ALL THE HOLES. NOW, ONCE THESE ARE BODYWORKED AND PAINTED, THEY'RE GOING TO BE TOTALLY ONE-OFF AND GO WITH THE REST OF THE LOOK OF THIS MODEL A. ♪♪ Ryan: WE GOT THE WHEELS OVER HERE FOR THE MODEL A IN THE BODY SHOP. WE GOT THEM ALL WELDED UP AND GROUND DOWN, SO WE'RE GOING TO COME THROUGH, AND WE'RE GOING TO BODY WORK THEM TO MAKE THEM NICE AND STRAIGHT. ♪♪ WE GOT THE WELDS ADDRESSED. I'M GOING TO PREP IT FOR BODY FILLER. I'M GOING TO SPREAD SOME FIBERGLASS FILLER, SAND IT, AND I'LL SEND IT OVER TO PAINT. SO WE COULD HAVE GONE WITH BARE METAL WHEELS LIKE THE REST OF THE VEHICLE, BUT IT NEEDS SOME KIND OF CONTRAST. THE PRODUCT WE'RE USING TODAY IS JET BLACK. IT LOOKS A MILE DEEP WHEN YOU SPRAY IT. SINGLE-STAGE PAINT MEANS IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL BASE COAT, CLEAR COAT FINISH. SIMPLY SPRAY DOWN THE COLOR, AND THE COLOR IS GLOSSY WHEN IT DRIES. GET UP IN IT. ♪♪ LOOK AT THAT. ISN'T THAT PRETTY? ♪♪ TODAY, I'M BRINGING IN AN OLD FRIEND TO HELP US OUT WITH THE ROOF ON THE MODEL A. MARTIN MAKES HIGH-END HANDCRAFTED FURNITURE, SO HE'S THE PERFECT PERSON TO COLLABORATE WITH. ALL RIGHT, MARTIN. THANKS FOR COMING IN. WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? SO JUST BUILDING, LIKE, A WILD KIND OF OVER-THE-TOP HOT ROD. SO WE'RE KIND OF TRYING TO THINK OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT COOL, AND WE REALLY HAVE KIND OF FREE REIGN ON THIS PROJECT. WE CAN KIND OF DO WHATEVER WE WANT, SO CHARLES AND I WERE KICKING AROUND A LOT OF IDEAS, AND IT CAME DOWN TO THE ROOF. SO, ORIGINALLY, THERE WERE WOOD RACES THAT RAN ACROSS, AND WE WERE THINKING, LIKE, WHAT IF WE ACTUALLY USED SOME, LIKE, REALLY HIGH-END HARDWOOD AND -- CHANGE IT UP A BIT SO WE STILL GOT WOOD, YOU CAN STILL SEE DOWN IN THE CAR, BUT SOMETHING MORE EXOTIC. THE TOP IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PRETTY CHOPPED, YOU KNOW, SO IT'S GOING TO BE DOWN ABOUT 5 INCHES. SO WHEN YOU WALK UP TO IT, I KIND OF WANT PEOPLE TO BE LIKE, "WHOA. WHAT'S THAT?" WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SIMPLE. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT LOOK SIMPLE, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I THINK IT'S A GREAT PROJECT. I THINK WE CAN DO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE. I'M THINKING SOMETHING WITH AN EXOTIC HARDWOOD, SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS GOING TO POP FOR YOU GUYS. OKAY. WITH THE CURVATURES OF THE ROOF HERE, I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT OF GREAT THINGS. IN THE CASE OF THE STRIPS, I THINK WE RUN THEM FRONT TO BACK. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. LOOKS LIKE A HELL OF A PROJECT. WE'LL HAVE TO WRAP THIS WITH METAL I THINK JUST SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING GOOD TO END THE WOOD INTO. NO, I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. YEP. THERE COULD BE SOME SHEET-METAL WORK THAT THEN TERMINATES THIS IN NICE AND SQUARE. WE CAN THEN BRING OUR WOOD RIGHT UP TO THAT AND DO SOME REAL COOL WOOD JOINTERY RIGHT ACROSS. REALLY GOES BACK TO THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE CRAFTSMANSHIP THAT WENT INTO THE CAR. COOL. I THINK IT'S GOING TO LOOK GOOD. IT'S GOING TO LOOK GREAT. AWESOME. ♪♪ Scott: SO, RIGHT NOW, THE MODEL A IS JUST A BIG PAPER CAR. WE JUST INSTALLED THE TRANSMISSION AND DRIVESHAFT TUNNEL. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE DASHBOARD OUT OF CARDBOARD TOO AND ALSO BOMBER SEATS.

AS CRAZY AS THE CREW MIGHT SEEM, WE'RE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY, SO, TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO CELEBRATE PAUL'S BIRTHDAY WITH A COUPLE M-80s. ALL RIGHT, PAUL.

OH, ****. ♪♪ OH. **** NOAH. ♪♪ TASTES LIKE GUNPOWDER. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪♪ SO, TODAY, SCOTT AND CHARLES ARE FINALLY CHOPPING THE ROOF OF THE MODEL A. THIS THING IS GOING TO LOOK RIDICULOUS. I SAY WE CHOP IT DOWN REAL LOW AND LEAVE THE ROOF OFF, AND THEN WE AIN'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. ALL I SAW WAS YOUR HAND GO FROM THIS TO THIS SO, LIKE, NO BACK WINDOW KIND OF CHOP. WELL, I FIGURE IF WE JUST CUT IT ALL THE WAY DOWN, MAKE IT A COMPLETE CONVERTIBLE ROADSTER, GOING IN THE TOP. I HEAR YOU, BUT I THINK NOAH WANTS THIS THING CHOPPED. SO ARE WE IN AGREEMENT THAT 5 INCHES, TO GET THE LOOK THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER, I THINK IT HAS TO BE 5 INCHES. MM-HMM. YOU KNOW? YEAH, 5 IS COOL TO ME. LET'S START BY CHOPPING. LET'S JUST CUT IT, SET IT BACK DOWN INTO PLACE AND SEE IF WE LIKE IT. Charles: RIGHT NOW, WE'RE MARKING OFF 5 INCHES ALL THE WAY AROUND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CUT OUT OF THIS THING. SO YOU'LL NOTICE, ON THE A PILLAR, THE B PILLAR, WE'VE GOT IT MARKED, YOU KNOW, IN THE SAME SPOTS. BUT AS WE GET BACK HERE, WE'VE RAISED THINGS UP, AND THAT'S JUST SO, WHENEVER WE MAKE THIS CUT AND GET AROUND TO THE BACK WINDOW, WE LAND IN A GOOD SPOT WITH THE BACK WINDOW. IN THE END, IT DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS WE'RE CUTTING 5 INCHES OUT ALL THE WAY AROUND, IT'S GOING TO SIT DOWN THE WAY IT SHOULD. YOU ONLY GET ONE CHANCE TO CUT THIS ROOF, SO YOU'VE GOT MEASURE MULTIPLE TIMES, MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT LAID OUT RIGHT, AND JUST DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECK EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU CUT. I'M JUST READY TO CUT IT. CAN'T TURN BACK NOW. ♪♪ WHOA. MAN, YOU'RE GOING TO CUT ME. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT. IT SHOULD BE LOOSE. ♪♪ ONLY THING LEFT TO DO IS DO IT. ♪♪ LAST PIECE. ♪♪ WHEW. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO HOME. LIKE THAT, MARK? ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW JUST CHOPPING THEM JUST CHANGES THE WHOLE BALL GAME? - THAT'S AWESOME. - THAT CRAZY-LOOKING, DUDE. YEAH. ♪♪ - YOU LIKE IT? - YEAH. ♪♪ I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THE WAY THE CHOP TURNED OUT. PROBABLY A FEW MORE HOURS TO GO. WE'LL HAVE IT ALL METAL-FINISHED, THEN IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. ♪♪ WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK THIS THING LOOKS AWESOME. I FRICKING LOVE IT. I THINK IT'S THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF CHOP. IT'S JUST NICE AND PROPORTIONATE. IT'S ALL IN PROPORTION RIGHT NOW. SO, LIKE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THREE-QUARTER VIEW OF THIS CAR, IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD, I THINK. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT -- I VOICED THAT CONCERN. I WAS WORRIED THE BACK WINDOW WAS GOING TO LOOK TOO SMALL. I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD HAVE COME THAT WAY. YEAH. WELL, COOL. GOOD JOB.WE'RE GLAD YOU LIKE IT. IT LOOKS FRICKING AWESOME. THE CHOP IS DONE. THE METALWORK IS DONE. WE'RE CHECKING THAT OFF THE GROCERY LIST, BUT THE GROCERY LIST JUST DON'T END, SO I GOT TO GET ONTO THE NEXT THINGS TO DO. ♪♪ SO, ON THE MODEL A, WE HAD THE IDEA TO DO A ONE-OFF CUSTOM ROOF, SO I TALKED TO MY FRIEND, MARTIN, AND CONVINCED HIM TO LEND US SOME OF HIS WOODWORKING EXPERTISE AND CRAFT THE MOST UNIQUE ONE-OFF CRAZY WOOD ROOF EVER. ♪♪ ♪♪ THIS IS THE FIRST CAR ROOF THAT WE'VE EVER DONE, AND I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT. WE WENT WITH ZEBRAWOOD, WHICH IS A GREAT EXOTIC HARDWOOD, AND IT WILL HAVE A FINISH THAT HOLDS UP BETTER THAN MOST. ♪♪ THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DO IS CUT THE ZEBRAWOOD INTO THIN STRIPS ABOUT 2 1/2 INCHES WIDE. ♪♪ ♪♪ TO GIVE IT EXTRA STRENGTH, WE'RE GOING TO ADD IN STRIPS OF CARBON FIBER. ♪♪ ♪♪ A NIGHT ON OUR JIG WILL BEND IT TO THE RADIUS WE NEED. I'LL NEED TO BEND SIX MORE, AND THEN I CAN ASSEMBLE THE ROOF AND SEE WHAT THE GUYS THINK. ♪♪ ♪♪ THE SEATS FOR THE MODEL A, WE'VE GOT TO GET THOSE UPHOLSTERED TODAY. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DO THE LITTLE INSERTS HERE. WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COVER THEM IN A THICKER, MORE LIKE A SADDLE TYPE OF LEATHER. THIS SHOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE TO RIDE AT LEAST. LOOK AT ALL THESE RIVETS. WE GOT TO MAKE SOME TEMPLATES. WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CUT OUT THE HIDE, AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND KIND OF ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PAD. WE GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT. ♪♪ THAT'S KIND OF COOL THOUGH. JUST BEATING UP A DEAD COW. ♪♪ TIME TO MEASURE OUT AND PUNCH OUT SOME HOLES FOR THE RIVETS, AND THEN IT'S ASSEMBLY TIME. ♪♪ FINALLY DONE WITH THE SEATS FOR THE MODEL A. OVER 300 RIVETS LATER, BUT WE'VE GOT SOME LITTLE BIT OF DISTRESSED THICK HIDE. WHAT A PAIN IN THE BUTT, BUT IT'S DONE. I'M HAPPY. IT LOOKS GOOD. ♪♪ WE'RE ON THE FINAL STAGE OF THE MODEL A, AND IT LOOKS AWESOME. AFTER WE PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE CAR, DALE WILL BE READY TO BURN RUBBER. ♪♪ JUST PUTTING THE MODEL A WINDSHIELD IN. JUST ONE MORE PIECE TO THE PUZZLE. Scott: DON'T SCRATCH THE PAINT. ♪♪ ♪♪ I GOT TO TELL YOU, SITTING IN HERE IS AWESOME. YOU LOOK AROUND, CRAZY METALWORK EVERYWHERE. WOOD ON THE ROOF. I MEAN, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY? THIS IS PURE HOT ROD. ♪♪ WE'RE DOING FINAL ASSEMBLY ON THE ENGINE SO WE CAN FINALLY HEAR THIS HEMI RUN. WE'VE GOT A FEW MORE WIRES TO HOOK UP ON THE IGNITION SETUP, AND THEN WE'RE GOOD TO GO. ♪♪ ♪♪ OKAY. OUT FROM UNDERNEATH, LET'S LOWER IT DOWN AND FIRE IT OFF. OKAY. HERE WE GO. Scott: CLOSE THAT DOOR, BOSS. YOU GOT ANY OIL PRESSURE YET? MIGHT JUST BE THE LIFTERS PUMPING UP. [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] ♪♪ [ SPUTTERING CONTINUES ] - OH. - OH! - OHH! - OH! [ SPUTTERING CONTINUES ] NOTHING LIKE HAVING THE ENTIRE SHOP WATCH YOU TRY TO START AN ENGINE THAT WON'T START. THIS SUCKS. IT'S GOING TO ALL BE ON MY SHOULDERS IF IT DON'T START. [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] ♪♪ [ SPUTTERING CONTINUES ] I NEED TO WALK AWAY FOR A MINUTE. [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] I NEED TO WALK AWAY FOR A MINUTE. EVERYONE IS SO EXCITED ABOUT THE MODEL A THAT THE WHOLE SHOP HAS GATHERED AROUND TO HEAR IT FIRE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT STARTING, AND OUR SUPER MECHANIC, PAUL, ISN'T SURE WHY. LET'S CHECK OUR FIRING ORDER. YEAH. THAT'S AS RIGHT AS IT GETS. TRY AGAIN, CHARLES. Scott: HOLY ****. PUT THE HEADS ON BACKWARDS. Paul: NOTHING IS GOING LIKE I WANT IT TO. THIS ENGINE IS JUST PISSING ME OFF. LET'S DO IT. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] - WHOO-HOO! - YEAH! WELL, THE ENGINE FINALLY STARTED, BUT NOT WITHOUT A FEW ISSUES. APPARENTLY IT LIKES A LOT MORE TIMING THAN WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD. WE JUST HAD TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT. THAT'S ALL. MY GUYS KICKED ASS ON THIS BUILD. ALL THE GUYS RALLIED TOGETHER. THEY MADE THIS THING HAPPEN. COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO WORK WITH THESE GUYS. IT'S A BIG DEAL. THIS CAR IS A BIG STEPPING STONE FOR US. ♪♪ THE MODEL A IS FINALLY DONE. THE CAR LOOKS INSANE, SOUNDS INSANE, AND IF THIS CAR DOESN'T SCREAM ROCK AND ROLL, I DON'T THINK DALE KNOWS WHAT ROCK AND ROLL IS. IT'S TIME TO SEE WHAT HE THINKS. ♪♪ WHOA. Noah: IT'S FREAKING CRAZY.WOW. THE MORE I LOOK AT IT, THE MORE I'M JUST LIKE, "WHAT THE..." [ LAUGHS ] IT'S SO LOW. THAT IS SICK. I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES YOU WHEN YOU SEE IT IS THE STANCE OF THE WHOLE THING. IT LOOKS LIKE A LEOPARD JUST WAITING TO POUNCE, MAN. - WHAT DO YOU THINK? - DUDE. Noah: DOES IT LOOK ANY DIFFERENT AT ALL? Dale: OH, MAN. TOTALLY ONE OF A KIND, YOU KNOW, THROUGHOUT, SO WE STARTED WITH THIS EARLY '50s HEMI. IT'S A 331. A WEIAND 6-71 BLOWER ON TOP, DUAL HOLLEYS, JUST CLASSIC KIND OF POWER SETUP. HOW MUCH POWER IS THIS MAKING? THIS IS PUTTING ABOUT 500 HORSEPOWER OUT. 500 HORSE? YEP. WE COULD HAVE, LIKE, DONE SOMETHING WITH THE EXHAUST AND MADE IT QUIET AND SNUCK IT UNDERNEATH THE CAR, BUT... WHAT A WASTE. ...WHAT A WASTE. SO WE'RE DUMPING IT RIGHT ACROSS THE DOOR. THE FRONT SUSPENSION, WE'VE GOT A SPLIT WISHBONE, A 5-INCH DROP, BIG LINK-IN DRUM. I LOVE THIS THING HERE. THIS LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF PREDATORY FISH OR BIRD OR SOME SORT.IT IS, OR A BIRD. YES, IT'S GOING TO EAT UP, IN YOUR AREA, BUGS. BUGS, YEAH. IT JUST LOOKS MEAN. LIKE SOMETHING THAT CAME FROM THE FUTURE, YOU KNOW, BACK TO THE PAST TO TRY AND KILL YOU. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE INTERIOR BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO IT IS PRETTY CRAZY. OH, YEAH. SO, AFTER WE GOT THE BODY STRIPPED DOWN TO BARE METAL, WE CUT OUT THE FLOORS BECAUSE WE CHANNELED THE CHASSIS THROUGH THE FLOORS TO GIVE IT THIS STANCE. ALL ONE-OFF HANDMADE STUFF. THE DASH IS SUPER CLEAN. EVERYTHING IN THE INTERIOR IS HELD TOGETHER WITH BRASS RIVETS. I LOVE THE BRASS. IT LOOKS SO INDUSTRIAL, YOU KNOW? IT DOES. IT TIES THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER, YOU KNOW? LOOKS GREAT.IT'S REALLY COOL. SO THE SEATS, WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE SEATS ARE... COMFORT IS SECONDARY IN THIS KIND OF VEHICLE. IT'S A NEAT PIECE AND KIND OF A DRIVABLE SCULPTURE. SO WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE ROOF. IT'S LAYERS OF ZEBRAWOOD AND CARBON FIBER, SO IT'S VERY, VERY STIFF. IT'S A STRUCTURAL PIECE ON THE CAR. AND THEN WE TIED IN THE LEATHER IN THE INTERIOR TO KIND OF HIT THESE CHOCOLATE NOTES HERE. SO IT REALLY ALL KIND OF FLOWS, AND I'M KIND OF IN LOVE WITH IT... ABSOLUTELY. ...AS I THINK ALL THE GUYS ARE AS WELL. I'VE NEVER SEEN A CAR LIKE THIS. THAT INTERIOR, ON ITS OWN, IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT CAR FOR DAYS, AND YOU'LL NOTICE SOMETHING NEW EVERY TIME YOU DO. IT'S A PIECE OF ART. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, WE'VE GOT YOUR BASS. OH, MAN. CHARLES SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON THIS THING. WE TRIED TO INCORPORATE KIND OF WHAT WE THOUGHT YOU'D WANT. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF METAL FLAKE AND THEN CANDY OVER THE TOP, FRICKING -- OH, MAN. THAT'S SO GREAT. AND OBVIOUSLY A TON OF CLEAR OVER THE WHOLE THING. IT'S REAL RICH AND FRICKING COOL-LOOKING. SO IS THAT WHY THERE'S NO PAINT ON THE HOT ROD? YEAH, WE DIDN'T WANT TO UPSTAGE THE GUITAR. BECAUSE YOU TOOK ALL ITS TIME ON THIS. THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, WE LIKE BUILDING STUFF, BUT I THINK THE REAL TEST IS ACTUALLY, LIKE, DRIVING IT, SO WE SHOULD GO TERRORIZE THE TOWN. LET'S DO IT. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ ENGINE REVS ] [ LAUGHTER ] - WHOO! - [ LAUGHS ] ♪♪ ONE, TWO, THREE. GO! ♪♪ ♪♪
