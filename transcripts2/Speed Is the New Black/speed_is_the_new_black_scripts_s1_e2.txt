 YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS ANDHAUL ASS? WE'RE THE SHOP FOR YOU. BECAUSE HERE, SPEED IS THE NEW BLACK. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS MY BUDDY HESSE IS COMING IN TODAY. HE BOUGHT A 1990 PORSCHE. LONGTIME FRIEND OF MINE, LOVES TO DRIVE FAST, LOVES GERMAN CARS. SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH THIS THING. NICE PORSCHE. HEY, YEAH, THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU.YEAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU. AWESOME. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE A REALLY NICE, ORIGINAL CAR. RUNS AND DRIVES? YEAH. WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? WELL, IT'S A LITTLE TOO PLAIN JANE. WE NEED TO UPGRADE IT. WE CAN SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T WE GO FOR A DRIVE? AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.LET'S DO IT. THE 911'S KIND OF LIKE THE QUINTESSENTIAL GERMAN SPORTS CAR -- TECHNICALLY, THE LAST HAND-BUILT PORSCHE. I GREW UP LOVING 911s. I THINK THEY'RE GREAT CARS. THEY'RE RELIABLE CARS. SAME BODY WAS USED FROM 1965 TO 1994. IT WAS A LONG TIME. LITTLE CHANGES IN BETWEEN, BUT OVERALL, SAME SHAPE, ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS DESIGN. ♪♪ FOR YOU, WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE 911? WHAT REALLY, YOU KNOW, GETS YOU GOING WITH THIS CAR? IT'S A CLASSIC. IT'S A CAR FROM MY YOUTH. IT'S A CAR THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CAR, PARTICULARLY IN THIS AGE RANGE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST, MOST ENJOYABLE, MOST VISCERAL CARS HERE YOU'RE GOING TO DRIVE. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO REALLY DO WITH THE CAR? I'D LIKE TO, YOU KNOW, DO SOME TRACK DAYS. I WOULD LIKE TO, YOU KNOW, REALLY TIGHTEN IT UP AND, YOU KNOW, BE ABLE TO USE IT ON THE TRACK. SO, IMPORTANT QUESTION -- DO YOU STILL WANT TO DRIVE IT ON THE STREET, AS WELL? OR IS IT GOING TO BE A DEDICATED TRACK CAR? NO, NO. IT NEEDS TO BE STREETABLE. IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE, YOU OFTEN SACRIFICE SOME KIND OF STREETABILITY. THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA SOUND-DEADENING MATERIAL IN THIS CAR WE COULD TAKE OUT. I DON'T WANT THE THING TO BE TOTALLY SCOOPED OUT BARE, BUT SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE WILL NEED TO BE STRUCK. EXACTLY WHERE, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL HAVE TO HELP ME FIND THAT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT NOAH'S GOING TO HAVE WITH THIS CAR, ACTUALLY, I THINK, IS GOING TO BE TUNING THE SUSPENSION. WHERE IT DOES WHAT I NEED IT TO DO ON THE TRACK BUT ALSO DOESN'T PUNISH ME ON THE STREET, THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR HIM. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THESE CARS IS THE MOTOR, EXTREMELY RELIABLE. THEY MAKE GOOD POWER. I HATE TO GO INSIDE THE MOTOR AND MESS WITH ANY OF THAT. THESE THINGS ARE PRETTY CHOKED OUT. BUT WITH THE REALLY NICE FREE-FLOWING EXHAUST SYSTEM AND A DIFFERENT INTAKE AND A CHIP, YOU'D PROBABLY BE SURPRISED WHAT KIND OF PERFORMANCE WE CAN GET OUT OF IT. OKAY. TWO WORDS -- JUST TELL ME HOW YOU'D LIKE THE STYLING TO LOOK. ELEGANT AND AGGRESSIVE. ELEGANT AND AGGRESSIVE -- THAT WORKS WELL. I DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT'S TOO EXTRAVAGANT. YOU KNOW, I WANT SOMETHING THAT STILL SPEAKS TO KIND OF A TRADITIONAL 911 AESTHETIC. BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY SHOULD BE SUBSTANCE RATHER THAN STYLE. HESSE IS A PURIST IN TERMS OF THESE CARS, SO WE CAN'T GET AWAY WITH A TON IN TERMS OF JUST MODIFYING THE HECK OUT OF THE BODY. SO I THINK THE GOAL, FROM A DESIGN STANDPOINT, SHOULD BE STAY TRUE TO THE CAR'S ROOTS BUT MAKE IT A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE. IF WE CAN THROW IN STYLING FROM OLDER PORCHES INTO THIS ONE, I THINK HE'LL BITE ON IT, AND WE'LL BE GOOD TO GO. Noah: HERE IT IS -- LATEST PROJECT. Scott: PORSCHE! 1990 PORSCHE 911, LAST OF THE HAND-BUILT PORSCHES. SHE MAY LOOK PRETTY, BUT THIS PORSCHE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT. LITTLE DIFFERENT, ONE OF MY FAVORITES, AND I'M PRETTY PUMPED UP ABOUT IT. BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING A CUSTOM PORSCHE. CUSTOM. CUSTOMPORSCHE. FOR TODAY'S DESIGN MEETING ON THE PORSCHE, WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN SCOTT, OUR LEAD FABRICATOR, WHO IS A BIT OF A HOT-ROD GUY BUT STILL A GOOD DESIGN FOR US FOR ANY ONE OF THESE MEETINGS, AND PAUL, WHO WAS RAISED ON AIR-COOLED CARS AND IS A BIT OF AN EXPERT. SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO ON THIS ONE. I'VE KNOWN THIS GUY FOR A WHILE. HE WANTS SOMETHING THAT'S AGGRESSIVE, BUT HE WANTS SOMETHING THAT'S, YOU KNOW, PRETTY ELEGANT AND STAYS KIND OF TRUE TO FORM. THIS THING IS KIND OF, LIKE, THE DORKIEST-LOOKING PORSCHE WE'VE SEEN IN A WHILE. IT SITS WAY UP IN THE AIR. THE WHEELS ARE 16 INCHES. NOTHING HAS 16-INCH WHEELS NOW EXCEPT FOR SCOTT'S MINIVAN. [ CHUCKLES ] FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND, SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS BOTHERED ME -- FRONT END, WEIRD STUFF GOING ON HERE. I THINK WE GOT TO CLEAN UP THE WHOLE FRONT BUMPER. I'M PRETTY SURE WE COULD DO A COLD AIR KIT FOR THE BRAKES WHERE WE ACTUALLY GET RID OF THOSE FOG LIGHTS, GET RID OF THE BUMPERETTES, AND WE COULD PUT SCOOPS DOWN TO HIS BRAKES TO KEEP HIS BRAKES COOL AT THE TRACK. HEADLIGHT MODS? I THINK IF WE LEAN THESE HEADLIGHTS BACK A LITTLE BIT... THEY LOOK A LITTLE BULGY. WHAT I SEE IS A SOCCER-MOM PORSCHE WITH COKE-BOTTLE GLASSES. RIGHT. WE CAN CHANGE THAT. GOING TO DO SOME METALWORK ON HER? YEAH, WE COULD DO --WIDE BODY KIT. SIDE VENTS. Scott: I SEE SOME HEADS SHAKING NO, SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO WIDE BODY, BUT STANCE, WHEEL AND TIRE, AND TURNING THIS THING INTO A HOT ROD, I'M SURE WE CAN HANDLE, JUST NOT AS BAD OF A HOT ROD AS IT COULD BE. NO, I MEAN, HE LIKES THE NARROW-BODY CARS. THERE'S SO MANY OF THESE HAVE BEEN CUT UP. ONCE YOU CUT THESE THINGS APART, THERE'S NO GOING BACK. THEY DON'T LIKE A BUBBLE BUTT? ILIKE THE BUBBLE BUTT. ILIKE A BUBBLE BUTT. WE CAN'T GO BUBBLE BUTT WITH IT. SCOTT REALLY WANTS TO CUT THIS CAR UP INTO A MILLION PIECES, AND THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS, SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD HIM OFF AND MAKE SURE WE DO WHAT HESSE ACTUALLY WANTS IN TERMS OF THE DESIGN. SO, A COUPLE THINGS. HE WANTS A LOT MORE PERFORMANCE OUT OF THE CAR. HE DOESN'T WANT TO TOUCH THE INSIDE OF THE MOTOR. Paul: I SAY WE JUST DO AN AIR INTAKE UPGRADE AND DO A BADASS HEADER ON IT, DO AWAY WITH THE HEAT EXCHANGERS, AND THEN DO A CHIP THAT KNOWS THAT WE'VE MADE THESE CHANGES, AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE IT'LL MAKE. IN DOING THAT, THOUGH, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DUAL EXHAUSTS, AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING COOL ON THE BACK END. WING THING OR NO WING THING? HE WANTS A SKINNY BUTT AND NO WING? I WAS THINKING A DUCKTAIL -- PRETTY SIMPLE. AND THEN, FOR THE INTERIOR, I WANTED TO GUT THE WHOLE INTERIOR, AND HE KIND OF, LIKE, WASN'T REALLY FEELING THAT DIRECTION, SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE SEATS OUT, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO A MUCH LIGHTER-WEIGHT SEAT, TAKE THE REAR SEATS OUT, PUT A ROLL BAR IN THE REAR, AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO DROP THE HARNESSES THROUGH THE BACK OF THE SEAT. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? - THAT'D BE COOL. - LET'S DO IT. LET'S ROCK IT. ♪♪ WE'RE GOING TO BLOW THIS PORSCHE APART HERE. I'M GOING TO DO A COLOR CHANGE ON IT, TIRES AND WHEELS, EXHAUST, A FEW OTHER GOODIES I THINK THEY GOT PLANNED FOR IT, AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS THING TORN UP. - GOT 'ER? - YEP. THIS IS WHAT HOT-ROD GUYS CALL OVER-ENGINEERED. OH, THE HUMANITY! NONE OF THESE CLIPS ARE BREAKING. THEY'RE ALLBREAKING. I ONLY BROKE ONE CLIP, DAN. OH, YOU ONLY BROKE ONE? YEAH. I BROKE, LIKE, ALL OF MINE. [ CHUCKLES ] KIND OF ON PURPOSE, THOUGH. THAT'S IT. ALL RIGHT. BACK TO THE MECHANICS. OUGHT TO DRIVE OVER THERE. I MEAN, WE DIDN'T TAKE NOTHING OFF OF IT. WELL, THIS OUGHT TO BE REALLY FUN HERE. IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, THIS WAS DAN'S IDEA. [ IGNITION CHIMING ] PROBABLY NOT THE SAFEST WAY TO DRIVE A PORSCHE, SITTING ON A MILK CRATE WORKING A STICK SHIFT, BUT, YOU KNOW, GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. [ CHIMING CONTINUES ]GHOST-RIDE THIS WHIP. HEY. SHUT YOUR DOOR SO THE DINGER GOES OFF. [ CHIMING STOPS ] THERE WE GO. OH! YOU ALMOST HIT THAT THING. [ CHIMING RESUMES ]SHUT YOUR DOOR, MAN! [ CHIMING STOPS ]YEAH! OH, EASY. WHOA. EASY THERE, GHOST RIDER.SPECIAL DELIVERY. ALL RIGHT, IS THIS YOUR STOP? THAT'S MY STOP. I'M OUT. THANKS, UBER. PORSCHES AREN'T REALLY MY THING, BUT, HEY, I'M NOT GOING TO PASS A CHANCE UP TO DRIVE ONE. I JUST THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE NICER SEATS IN THEM. WANT MY SEAT BACK. ♪♪ HERE'S THE PORSCHE. - THERE'S THE MOTOR. - YEAH. I AIN'T NEVER WORKED ON NO VOLKSWAGEN LIKE THIS, SO... WELL, THERE'S A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING, SCOTT. I HEAR YOU. SO, WE HAVE A 1990 PORSCHE 911 THAT OUR CLIENT WANTS US TO GET TRACK-WORTHY, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT US TO TOUCH THE ENGINE. SO I CHOSE A CUSTOM HEADER SETUP AND EXHAUST SYSTEM AND A CHIP, WHICH WILL GIVE US ABOUT 50 MORE HORSEPOWER. BUT FIRST, WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE GUYS CAN GET IT TO FIT. UP, UP, AND AWAY. WE GOT THIS KILLER NEW EXHAUST, BUT IT'S A DUALEXHAUST. CAR HAD SINGLE EXHAUST. SO WE GOT TO MOCK IT ALL UP, SEE WHAT FITS, WHAT DON'T, 'CAUSE WE KNOW WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING SOMEWHERE TO HAVE TWO PIPES INSTEAD OF ONE. WELL, GETTING THE HEAT EXCHANGERS OFF. THAT WAY, WE CAN PUT THE NEW HEADERS ON THAT ARE GOING TO BYPASS THIS. OH, AND AN ASS WHUPPING, HE HITS ME WITH THAT PIPE. THAT'S WHY I GOT THE PIPE. WE READY TO OPEN UP THE NEW EXHAUST AND SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE? THEY WANTED US TO MOCK IT UP, SO... YEAH, I'LL GO GET IT. ♪♪ Paul: THIS DUAL EXHAUST IS GOING TO ADD GREAT LOOKS, AMAZING SOUND, AND, MOST OF ALL, IT'S GOING TO FREE UP THE HORSEPOWER THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. Paul: MAKING A RACECAR OUT OF THIS THING. Scott: LIGHT AND FAST. - BAM. - YEAH, IT'S NICE. HEADERS FIT GOOD, DUDE. YEAH. YOU READY FOR BIG MAMA? - YEAH, SUCKER. - SHE'S STARTING. LOOK AT THAT. WE'RE PUTTING A FACTORY BUMPER BACK ON THE CAR, TEMPORARILY. IT HAS SINGLE-EXHAUST OUTLET IN THE BUMPER. WE NOW HAVE DUAL EXHAUST ON THE CAR. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS SEE IF WE CAN NOTCH THAT AND FABRICATE SOMETHING OR DELETE THE WHOLE BUMPER AND START FROM SCRATCH OR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. ♪♪ DOUG'S COMING IN TODAY -- FIRST-TIME CLIENT, BRINGING IN AN ABSOLUTE BEAST OF A CADILLAC, BRAND-NEW CAR. SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF STUFF WE CAN DO WITH HIM. [ ENGINE REVS ] - WHAT'S UP, DOUG? - WHAT'S UP, MAN? YOU WEREN'T JOKING. THIS CADILLAC IS BADASS. LET'S GO FOR A RIDE. ♪♪ Doug: IT'S A BRAND-NEW 2017 CTS-V. BOUGHT IT BACK IN AUGUST, SET IT UP TO SHIP DOWN TO JOHN HENNESSEY, WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HIS WORK DOWN IN SEALY, TEXAS. IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW, JOHN HENNESSEY BUILDS SOME OF THE BADDEST EVERYDAY DRIVERS YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON. IT'S LIKE 800, 900, 1,000 HORSEPOWER -- TOTALLY NUTS. I WANTED TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING MORE. NOTHING DRIVES ME CRAZIER THAN WHEN I PULL UP TO A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR A STOP SIGN AND I SEE SOMEBODY SITTING BESIDE ME IN THE SAME CAR. THAT'S USUALLY TIME TO GO BUY A NEW CAR, FOR ME. ♪♪ WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO DO NOW IS LAY SOME CUSTOM PAINT, WHICH IS WHY I'M BRINGING IT TO YOU. I THINK WE'VE GOT -- REALLY, THE SKY'S THE LIMIT IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT PAINT SCHEMES WE CAN DO ON IT. YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING WAS, WHEN THEY HAD IT DOWN IN TEXAS, THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN EXHAUST THEY COULD PUT ON IT YET. 'COURSE, YOU KNOW, NOBODY HAD MADE AN EXHAUST FOR THE CAR YET. SO WE NEED TO GET AN EXHAUST PUT ON IT, SO I FIGURED THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE WE COULD DO. I MEAN, IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A GROWL TO IT, BUT I WANT A LITTLE BIT MORE. [ ENGINE REVS ] HOLY COW. MAN, IT POPS OFF. RIGHT? OH, YEAH. I MEAN, WOULD YOU HAVE THOUGHT CADILLAC COULD HAVE MADE A TRANSMISSION LIKE THAT? THAT WAS A QUICK POP, POP. THIS IS THE BEST OF -- [ ENGINE REVS ]HOLY COW. YEP. [ LAUGHS ] CAR'S VERY COOL -- ABSOLUTE MODERN INTERIOR, DIGITAL DASH. WAY TOO FAST FOR THE ROAD, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULD ABSOLUTELY DRIVE THIS CAR DAILY. SO, ONE THING WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET, WHICH PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, USUALLY DO, ARE THE WHEELS. WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO ME LOOKING AROUND AND SEEING WHAT WE COULD FIND? HONESTLY, NOAH, ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE THIS CAR FURTHER STAND OUT, I'M UP FOR. SO WHATEVER ELSE YOU COME UP WITH -- I'M GIVING YOU GUYS A BLANK SLATE RIGHT NOW. CLIENTS LIKE DOUG ARE AWESOME. AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE JUST WANTS A CAR THAT'S CUSTOM-TAILORED TO HIM, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DO. [ ENGINE REVS ] THIS THING'S FREAKING FAST. [ CHUCKLES ] I MEAN, IT'S GREAT -- IT'S STUPID FAST, AND IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE IT'S TRYING THAT HARD. NO, IT WASN'T. I MEAN, THAT WAS, LIKE, 60% THROTTLE. I'M MISSING OUT. I NEED TO CHANGE CARS. [ ENGINE REVS ] AND PANTS. ♪♪ Noah: SINCE WE'RE NOT STRIPPING THE PORSCHE DOWN TO A BARE METAL SHELL ON THE INTERIOR, IT'D BE A REALLY BAD IDEA TO SAND-BLAST IT, SO WE'RE GOING TO MECHANICALLY STRIP THE EXTERIOR, WEAR SOME RESPIRATORS. WE'LL BE GOOD TO GO. ♪♪ MR. FRANCY-PANTS. YOU'RE JUST DYING TO DO SOMETHING TO THIS CAR, AREN'T YOU? WHEW. LOOK AT THIS ONE. SO, ONE THING WE DON'T DO IS COOKIE-CUTTER CARS, AND HESSE SAID HE WANTS ELEGANT, YET AGGRESSIVE, STYLING. SO I'M GOING TO SEND MY SHOP MANAGER, CHARLES, TALK TO SCOTT, SEE WHAT HE CAN WHIP UP. HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL PIECE, YOU KNOW. IT HAD THE REVERSE LIGHTS IN IT RIGHT HERE, AND IT MEETS UP AGAINST THE TAILLIGHTS IN THE BACK, LIKE SO. OKAY? SO, MY QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT DOING A METAL PANEL WITH DIMPLE DIES IN IT AND THEN INCORPORATE THE REVERSE LIGHTS INTO, LIKE, THE VERY OUTBOARD DIMPLE DIE HOLES? THAT'D BE COOL-LOOKING. I'M LOOKING AT THIS CAR, AND I'M THINKING, "IT NEEDS MORE OF OUR TOUCH." RIGHT. AWESOME. WE'LL GET THAT MADE. ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE BACK. - GOING TO GET FRANCY WITH IT. - I'LL BE BACK. Scott: TWO PIECES OF PLASTIC, WE HEATED IT UP AND KNOCKED THE RED, CLEAR PLASTIC OFF THE TOP 'CAUSE WE'RE GOING TO FAB UP A METAL COVER THAT REPLACES THIS. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT, WE ACTUALLY GOT OUR SMILEY-FACE RADIUS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. BUT NOW, YOU LOOK AT THAT PANEL, IT'S HIGH ON EACH END. NOW WE'VE GOT TO RADIUS THIS PANEL THIS WAY. WHEN YOU'RE SHRINKING METAL, THE TWO TEETH ARE SPREAD APART, AND WHEN IT BITES DOWN ON THE METAL, IT SQUEEZES THE METAL TOGETHER. WHEN IT SQUEEZES THAT METAL TOGETHER, IT'S GOING TO ARCH YOUR METAL THIS WAY. NOW, WITH THE LIGHTS BEHIND IT, THEY CAN'T SEE THROUGH, SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS A DIMPLE-DIE PATTERN, WHICH IS OLD VINTAGE AIRCRAFT AND RACECAR. LIGHTING UP THAT PANEL TAKES A BORING, ORDINARY PIECE OF SHEET METAL AND PUTS A LOT OF JAZZ IN IT, MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY COOL. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT, WE SHAPED THE METAL AND THEN DIMPLE-DIED IT FULL OF HOLES. PUTS A LOT OF FLAVOR IN A BORING PIECE OF METAL. ♪♪ YO, MARKY. HEY, GOT YOUR WHALE TAIL HERE FOR YOU, MAN. THAT'S NICE.THAT GOING TO FIT? LET ME SEE IT. LET ME TRY THAT OUT. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING. ALL RIGHT. IT WORKS. I THINK IT GOES THIS WAY. THERE YOU GO. [ QUACKING ] THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I JUST WANT TO SEE HOW IT FITS IN THE HOLE. GONNA FIT? PUT IT WHERE YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE IT. I WANT TO PUT MY PANEL IN THERE. I MADE THAT LOWER PANEL. THERE WE GO. NOW DROP IT DOWN. LOOK AT THAT GAP. I KNOW. HOLY COW. I KNOW. LOOK AT THAT CORNER. WOW. MAN, THE CORNERS DIVE DOWN REALLY HARD. YEAH. THE SHAPE'S ALL WRONG THERE. SO, DEALING WITH A PORSCHE, YOU THINK, WHEN YOU BUY AN AFTERMARKET PRODUCT, IT'S GOING TO BE A NICE FIT. OURS, IT'S NOT A NICE FIT. MARK AND THE GUYS GOT A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE THIS THING FIT. IT'S LIKE IT'S ALMOST TOO NARROW. YEAH. SOMETHING AIN'T RIGHT HERE. YOU COULD CHECK THE OIL THROUGH THE GAP OVER HERE. [ CHUCKLES ] PRETTY BIG. YOU GOT YOUR HANDS FULL HERE. YEP. ♪♪ Noah: SO, WE GOT A NEW SPOILER IN FOR THE PORSCHE, AND THIS DUCKTAIL DOES NOT FIT THE CAR CORRECTLY. NOTHING PISSES ME OFF MORE THAN THESE AFTERMARKET PARTS THAT DON'T FIT. AND THEN WE GOT TO SPEND A TON OF TIME AND MONEY TRYING TO GET THEM RIGHT FOR THE CUSTOMER'S CAR, SO WE GOT TO GET IT DONE TODAY. ALL THESE EDGES, THEY'RE NOWHERE NEAR RIGHT. WE GOT A HUGE GAP. SO I THINK WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO BUILD A FLANGE, PROBABLY 3/4 INCH, ALONG THE WHOLE THING. THAT WAY, I CAN GRIND THAT BACK DOWN SO IT'S NICE AND FLUSH WITH THE BODY AND LOOKS SOMEWHAT FACTORY. I'M BUILDING THE FLANGES OUT OF FIBERGLASS. IT'S ITCHY, AND IT TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE TO DO IT, BUT THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT RIGHT IS TO USE MORE FIBERGLASS. WE COULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS AND DONE THIS, LIKE, THE QUICK AND EASY WAY AND FILLED THEM IN WITH BODY FILLER, BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE THE RIGHT WAY. IT WOULDN'T BE THE LONG-LASTING WAY. THAT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT REALLY WELL. WE'VE NOW GOT REALLY GOOD GAPS ALL THE WAY AROUND. ♪♪ FINALLY, THE FIBERGLASS NIGHTMARE SPOILER IS FINISHED ON THE PORSCHE. IT'S TIME TO GET IT INTO PAINT. ALL RIGHT, THE PORSCHE 911 -- JUST BEEN PREPPED AND SEALED. NOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT DOWN A BLACK BASE COAT TO GET OUR FINAL COLOR TO COVER BETTER. ♪♪ SO, JASON DID A BLACK COAT BEFORE THE BLUE JUST TO GET THE PAINT LOOKING RIGHT AND RICH AND READY TO GO. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE PRIMER COMING THROUGH SOME OF THESE COLORS. YOU CAN TELL WHEN PEOPLE SKIP THAT STEP, AND IT LOOKS ALL WRONG. ♪♪ SO, WE'RE GOING TO PUT A LITTLE AMERICAN MUSCLE INTO THIS PORSCHE BUILD OF OURS WITH SOME SUNOCO BLUE. ROGER PENSKE USED THIS IN THE TRANS AM SERIES ON THEIR -- WHAT IS IT? '67 CAMARO, I BELIEVE IT WAS? AND IT WAS A PRETTY SWEET RIDE. SO WE FIGURE, WHY NOT PUT IT ON A NICE GERMAN PORSCHE? I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OTHER AIR-COOLED 911s RUNNING AROUND WITH THIS PAINT COLOR ON IT, SO IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE ONE-OFF AND TOTALLY UNIQUE. THERE'S NO PEARL, THERE'S NO METALLIC --S JUST A CLASSIC, TOUGH, MEAN PAINT JOB. IT'S GOING TO LOOK RIDICULOUS ON THE STREETS AND ON THE TRACK. ♪♪ SO, WE DO THREE COATS OF COLOR AND THEN FIVE COATS OF CLEAR, AND THAT'S WHY GOOD PAINT JOBS TAKE FOREVER. ♪♪ SO, WE FINALLY GOT THE PORSCHE BACK FROM THE BODY SHOP, ALL PAINTED THE SUNOCO BLUE. NOW WE GOT TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER. WE'LL RAISE IT UP, SLIDE THE MOTOR IN, DROP THE CAR DOWN OVER IT, JUST THAT QUICK AND EASY -- I HOPE. BUT YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES. WHAT ALL DID YOU DO TO THIS? PUT SOME ROCKER COVER GASKETS ON IT, ADJUSTED THE VALVES, PUT SOME NEW PLUGS IN IT AND CLEANED IT UP, CHECKED TIMING CHAIN TENSION -- ALL THAT STUFF. YOU GOT DEEP INTO IT. - OKAY. COME DOWN SOME MORE. - I'M DOWN. - GOOD? - YEAH. SO, I GUESS THERE AIN'T MUCH SPECIAL ABOUT THIS BASIC, ORDINARY, AIR-COOLED ENGINE THAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME. WELL, ONE COOL THING ABOUT IT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A COOLING SYSTEM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OIL AROUND THE CRANKSHAFT TO SLOW IT DOWN. BETTER ENGINEERING WENT INTO ROAD RACING. THE OTHER THING IS, IT'S GOT A DRY SUMP SYSTEM, TOO. QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN YOUR STANDARD, EVERYDAY SITUATION. [ CRICKETS CHIRPING ] WE AIN'T NEVER GOING TO PUT OIL IN IT OR EVER HEAR IT RUN IF YOU KEEP JUST TELLING ME ABOUT IT. LET'S GET ROLLING ON IT. SEE, THAT'S WHY I TRY NOT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. OKAY, NOW WE CAN RAISE IT UP, START ATTACHING STUFF WE UNHOOKED. LOOKS GOOD TO ME. COOL. NOW I GET MY WORKBENCH BACK. ♪♪ Dan: ALL RIGHT, SO, WE GOT ALL THE GRAPHICS LAID OUT WITH THE BLUE FINE LINE. CUSTOMER'S SEEN THEM, SEEMS PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. Noah: DOUG'S CADILLAC IS A BADASS PERFORMANCE MACHINE, BUT HE WANTS IT TO STAND OUT ON THE STREET. SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM A ONE-OF-A-KIND, OVER-THE-TOP PAINT JOB THAT HE'S GOING TO LOVE IT. ♪♪ Dan: GET THIS THING CLEARED, KICK IT OVER TO THE MECHANICS FOR THE KILLER EXHAUST SYSTEM THEY'RE GOING TO PUT ON IT. ♪♪ SO, THE GUYS ARE WORKING AWAY ON THE PORSCHE, AND HESSE SHOWS UP UNANNOUNCED. I LOVE MY CLIENTS AND ALL, BUT, YOU KNOW, JUST THE WHOLE SURPRISE FACTOR IS JUST, I DON'T KNOW, SOMETIMES A LITTLE MUCH. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DIDN'T EXPECT BLUE. - YOU DIDN'T EXPECT BLUE? - NO. NO. I DIDN'T. SO, WE TALKED ABOUT MORE OF AN AGGRESSIVE LOOK, KIND OF LIKE A HISTORIC RACING THROWBACK BUT KIND OF STAY TRUE TO THE CAR'S ORIGINS. YEAH, YEAH. I LOOKED, AND I LOOKED, AND IN THE END, I CAME UP WITH THIS BLUE -- SUNOCO BLUE. IT'S AWESOME, IT'S DEEP, IT'S DARK. NO, IT IS. IT IS VERY NICE. I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT BLUE. I WAS THINKING MAYBE GREEN OR DOVE GRAY OR SOMETHING. DO YOU LIKE IT? I DO. I DO LIKE IT, YEAH. NO, IT'S SOLID. SO, I'VE KNOWN HESSE FOR YEARS. KIND OF A TOUGH GUY TO READ. HE SAID HE LIKED THE BLUE. ILIKED THE... BLUE. AND I THINK -- AND I HE LIKED THE BLUE. WE'RE COMING TOGETHER NICELY. WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING ON TO INTERIOR PRETTY SOON. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I GOT SOME COOL PARTS TO SHOW YOU. THIS LOOKS GREAT. WE GOT IT ALL CLEANED UP. IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS CLEAN.IT WAS IN GREAT SHAPE. WE RESEALED EVERYTHING -- READY TO ROLL. SO CAN'T WAIT TO TURN THIS THING ON AND LET IT RIP. OKAY. NICE. SO, TELL ME ABOUT BRAKES. WE HAVE BRAKES COMING IN IN ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS. THEY WERE BACK-ORDERED. BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN AWESOME SETUP FOR THE CAR. WELL, THAT TIMELINE COULD BE A PROBLEM. I DIDN'T MENTION THIS, BUT I HAVE A TRACK DAY COMING UP IN TWO WEEKS. [ LAUGHS ] WELL... YEAH. THAT POSES A BIT OF A PROBLEM. WHERE'D HE GET TWO WEEKS FROM? FOR A TRACK DAY? I DON'T KNOW WHO HE THINKS WE ARE. WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO AN EVEN BIGGER BRAKE UPGRADE? IT'S GOING TO COST MORE MONEY, BUT I'VE GOT AN IDEA. AS LONG AS THEY'RE IN STOCK, WE COULD GET A REALLY SERIOUS BRAKE SETUP. I THINK YOU'D LIKE IT. WANT ME TO CHECK INTO IT? YEAH, DO. DEFINITELY. SO, IN TERMS OF TIME, TWO WEEKS? TWO WEEKS. I WISH I'D KNOWN THAT EARLIER. ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. BEAR WITH ME. I'LL TRY TO GET IT TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. COOL. ♪♪ Scott: ALL RIGHT, SO, WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THE PORSCHE'S SCHEDULED FOR A TRACK DAY. WE GOT THE MOTOR IN. WE JUST GOT TO THRASH AND GET THE EXHAUST ON BECAUSE THE BODY SHOP NEEDS TIME TO GET THE BUMPERS ALL FINESSED AND FITTING PROPERLY WITH THE DUAL EXHAUST. YOU RAISE THE CAR UP ANY HIGHER, I'M GOING TO NEED A LADDER TO WORK WITH YOU. OH, I LOWER IT DOWN ANY MORE, I GET MY HAIR ALL DIRTY. Paul: THIS DUAL EXHAUST IS GOING TO ADD JUST A CRAZY EUROPEAN LOOK TO THE CAR. PLUS, ON TRACK DAY, IT'S JUST GOING TO SCREAM. I MEAN, EVERYBODY'S GONNA KNOW WHO'S COMING AROUND THE CORNER. IS THE GUY ON THATSIDE OF THE MUFFLER AS GOOD-LOOKING AS THE GUY ON THISSIDE? UH... I DON'T KNOW, MAN.I PRETTY MUCH DOUBT IT. I'M PRETTY SURE THE GUY ON THIS SIDE IS WAY, WAY BETTER-LOOKING. WHY? 'CAUSE YOU FEEL TALL? YEAH. TOO-TALL PAUL IS YOUR NAME NOW. ♪♪ PRETTY! PRETTY AWESOME. MOCK-UP WENT NICE, FULL FINAL INSTALL WENT NICE, SO WE'RE IN THERE. HOPEFULLY, IT SOUNDS AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS. ♪♪ - WHOLE STRUTS. - HOLY COW! - ISN'T THAT... - YEAH. - MAN, THAT'S NICE. - OH, YEAH. Noah: SO, I'VE CHOSEN A REALLY HIGH-QUALITY COILOVER SETUP FOR THE PORSCHE. THIS THING'S GREAT 'CAUSE IT'S GOING TO ALLOW US TO LOWER THE CAR, DIAL IN THE DAMPING ON THE SHOCKS, AND UP FRONT, WE'VE GOT SOME NICE CAMBER PLATES THAT ALLOW US TO ADJUST THIS THING SO IT CORNERS REALLY, REALLY HARD, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HESSE IS GOING TO WANT. WELL, IT'S ASSEMBLED. THIS IS GOING TO BE A BREEZE. NO. IT'S NOT A BREEZE TILL WE'RE DONE. YEAH, LET'S GET THIS OLD SUSPENSION OFF. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT OFF AT THE LOWER MOUNTING POINT FIRST. [ THUD, CLACK ] SOUNDS LIKE SUCCESS. BEST SOUND IS WHEN IT HITS THE GROUND. WHAT WE PULLED OUT, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PUTTING IN. Scott: PORSCHE IS A COMPACT CAR, AND THEN THE GERMAN ENGINEERING -- LIKE, EVERYTHING'S OVER-ENGINEERED, MAKING THE MOST OF THE TIGHTEST SPACES, SO WHEN IT COMES TO DOING STUFF LIKE THIS, WHICH IS FUN STUFF, BUT IT'S ALL REAL KNUCKLE-BUSTING, TIGHT SPOTS TO GET ALL THE BOLTS IN AND OUT OF. Paul: WHEN WE GET OUR BRAKES ON AND WE GET OUR WHEELS ON, WE GET IT ON THE GROUND, WE CAN FINE-TUNE OUR RIDE HEIGHT, THIS ADJUSTMENT HERE, AND GET OUR STANCE THE WAY WE WANT IT. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS THING ON THE GROUND. Eric: WE JUST GOT THE CADILLAC BACK FROM PAINT AND BODY. WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THIS STOCK EXHAUST HERE. THIS THING SHOULD BE LOUD AS HELL, PISS THE NEIGHBORS OFF, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE OWNER WANTS. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT. Doug: HOLD ON TO IT THERE, ERIC. - HERE WE GO. - OKAY. NICE AND EASY. - LOOK AT THE SIZE DIFFERENCE. - ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU JUST WANT TO SNUG THESE. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. CHECK THIS OUT. SO, CADILLAC'S GOT THIS REALLY BADASS APP. YOU CAN CONTROL THIS CAR FROM A PHONE RIGHT HERE. SO I'M GOING TO TOTALLY SCREW WITH THESE GUYS RIGHT NOW. JUST PUSH THE BUTTON, SET THE ALARM OFF. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, I GOT --[ CAR ALARM BLARING ] OH. THAT'S THIS THING. WHY'S THAT? 'CAUSE WE'RE TAMPERING WITH IT. [ BLARING STOPS ] Eric: PROBABLY THINKING WE'RE STEALING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS...

THIS ONE, WE LEFT ON THE EXHAUST. [ ENGINE STARTS ] [ CHUCKLES ] THESE **** GUYS. WHERE'S CHARLES? CHARLES?! THEY RAN OUT THERE SO FAST. I THINK THEY BOTH **** THEIR PANTS.

IT'S AN ODD SITUATION TO BUILD A RACECAR WITH A SOUND SYSTEM IN IT, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN DOING IT. IT'S JUST A GIVE-AND-TAKE. WE'LL MAKE THIS FIT, MAKE THAT FIT. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SPEAKER ENCLOSURE, SO I GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE MORE AWAY FROM THAT JUST TO ACCOMMODATE THIS, AND THEN WE'LL PUT A PANEL, ACTUALLY, FOR THE SPEAKERS TO SIT IN.
