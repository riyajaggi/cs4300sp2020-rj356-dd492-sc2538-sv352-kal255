 INTO CUSTOM-TAILORED, HIGH-PERFORMANCE RIDES. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU WANT TO WIN SHOWS ANDHAUL ASS? WE'RE THE SHOP FOR YOU. BECAUSE HERE, SPEED IS THE NEW BLACK. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS - WHAT'S GOING ON? - I GOT IT. - IT'S BACK. - FROM THE DEAD. SO BRIAN IS COMING TODAY, AND I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A WHILE. WE'VE DONE A FEW SMALLER PROJECTS WITH HIM BUT NOTHING IN TERMS OF A FULL BUILD. SO, WHERE DID YOU PULL THIS THING OUT OF? I SENT IT TO A SHOP. THE SHOP WAS RUN BY AN EVIL HILLBILLY. -HE KIND OF -- AN EVIL HILLBILLY. THE GUY TOOK OFF -- ESSENTIALLY STOLE MY CAR, AND IT PISSED ME OFF BECAUSE I'D BEEN WITH THIS CAR FOR SO LONG, AND I'D WANTED TO SEE IT, YOU KNOW, GET TO THE FINISH LINE. SO I FOUND IT AND BROUGHT IT TO NOAH. I KNEW IT'D BE IN GOOD HANDS. THIS 300 WOULD HAVE ORIGINALLY BEEN, LIKE, A MID-PRICED LUXURY CAR. THIS THING IS, LIKE, PERFECTLY PRESERVED IN ITS OWN SPECIAL WAY. I'VE SEEN PLENTY THAT HAVE THIS ON TOP. BUT THEN IT'S SWISS CHEESE. YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF GUYS THAT ARE OUT THERE FAKING PATINAS -- FAUX-TINA RODS. PBHT! NOT A FAN. THAT IS THE HUNT. SO I WENT OUT SEARCHING FOR A PATINA ROD. AND IT WASN'T EASY. I DID HAVE AN INTERIOR. WHOA! YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. NOW YOU GOT A WATER BOTTLE AND AN OIL PAN. SO IT'S A BLANK CANVAS. SO WOULD YOU RATHER SPEND MORE OF YOUR MONEY ON PERFORMANCE STUFF OR ON INTERIOR STUFF? NO, THE MOTOR. ALL MOTOR. IF I CAN KEEP UP WITH MY HELLCAT, THAT WOULD BE COOL. I KNOW IT'S A TALL ORDER. THAT ACTUALLY IS A TALL ORDER. ALL RIGHT. BUT WE'VE GOT POWER PLANTS OUT THERE THAT CAN DO IT. YOU'LL LET ME DO WHATEVER I WANT? WELL, WITHIN REASON. - WITHIN REASON? - YEAH. WELL, REASON CAN BE DEFINED A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS, SO I LIKE THAT. IS THERE A MOTOR IN IT AT THE MOMENT? - THERE IS. - WHICH WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED. BADASS PATINA IN HERE, AS WELL. ANOTHER GOOD PALETTE TO WORK WITH. WHATEVER WE PUT IN HERE IS GONNA LOOK COOL. I DON'T THINK MY WIFE OR MY KIDS ARE GONNA WANT TO GET INTO IT BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE LOUD, HOT, AND FAST. - SO THIS IS, LIKE, DAD'S CAR. - NICE. -IT'S WIFE-PROOF. SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS KIND OF A PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED MODERN HOT ROD. YES. - KIND OF LIKE TIFFANY? - YES. TIFFANY IS OUR SHOP TRUCK, WHO HAS A WELL-WEATHERED LOOK, LET'S SAY. THE 300 ACTUALLY LOOKS VERY, VERY SIMILAR. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY SAT OUTSIDE IN THE SAME PLACE OR WHAT HAPPENED. - MEET TIFFANY'S COUSIN, DORIS! - YEAH. - THIS IS FULL OF MISSOURI. - DORIS! THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. CAN I HAVE THIS? CAN I DO THIS? YOU WANT A RADIATOR IN THE BACK? YEAH. - MAYBE. - OKAY. HOW ABOUT EXHAUST OUT THE SIDE? - I WANT THAT. - I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY. I WANT THAT, BUT I WANT IT BACK HERE. YOU WANT IT BACK THERE. WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR THE ENGINE BAY? WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IF DORIS COULD BE 1/10 OF TIFFANY, I'D BE THRILLED. ALL RIGHT, MAN. GONNA BUILD YOU A BADASS HOT ROD, COUSIN OF TIFFANY. YOU'RE GONNA BE ROLLING AROUND TOWN... - LOVE IT. - ...WREAKING HAVOC. GONNA BE AWESOME. - DORIS! - DORIS! MAKE IT HAPPEN. WOW. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! YOU LIKE IT, DON'T YOU? WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? WIDE-BODY THIS THING, TOO? NO, A CLASSIC NUT-AND-BOLT RESTORATION. OH, DUDE! FINALLY! YOU ALWAYS, LIKE, MIND-TEASE ME. DID YOU EAT SOME COLORADO GUMMIES? WHY DID WE EVEN BRING YOU ALONG? WHAT DID THE CUSTOMER SAY? HE PROBABLY WANTS TO TURN IT INTO A SPACESHIP OR SOMETHING. HE'S KIND OF GIVEN US FREE REIGN. HE WANTS TO KEEP THE OUTSIDE THE SAME. HE WANTS IT TO LAY FRAME ON THE GROUND. HE WANTS BIG WHEELS. HE WANTS A CRAZY MOTOR, AS LONG AS IT'S MOPAR. SO WHAT KIND OF DRIVETRAIN? WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING COOL. - VIPER ENGINE. - VIPER? HE DID SAY MANUAL, SO DO A SIX-SPEED VIPER. THIS THING IS SO COOL. LET'S LOOK AT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT REAL QUICK BEFORE WE GET TOO CARRIED AWAY. - WHOA! - UGH! FUN JUST STOPPED. SO, DO YOU THINK PAINT IN HERE OR... - I DON'T KNOW. - ...LEAVE THE PATINA? WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THE FIREWALL LOOKS PRETTY ROUGH. YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BOX THAT IN. SOMEBODY ALREADY TRIED TO DO A LITTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE FIX-UP UNDER HERE. IT'S A TORSION BAR FRONT SUSPENSION, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US ON THIS THING. YEAH, THIS IS ALL HANDMADE CHASSIS HERE. I THINK THIS THING'S GONNA BE COOL. IT'S GONNA BE CHALLENGING, THOUGH. LIKE YOU SAID, A BUNCH OF ONE-OFF PIECES. LET'S LOOK AT THE INTERIOR, OR THE LACK OF INTERIOR. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS INTERIOR. WHOA. WELCOME TO... SHAGVILLE. LOOK AT THIS. - I HAVE NO IDEA. - LOOK AT THAT SHAG CARPET. YOU LIKE THAT? LOOK HOW IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR CHIN. HERE, NOAH, YOU CAN HAVE A SOUL PATCH. GET THAT AWAY FROM ME. WHAT'S UP WITH THE DASH? THE DASH IS COOL. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A FUN BUILD, BUT IT'S GONNA BE A LOT-OF-WORK BUILD. YOU KNOW, LET'S DO A BUNCH OF, LIKE, METALWORKED INTERIOR. IF WE DID, LIKE, FOUR BOMBER SEATS ALL MADE OUT OF METAL WITH ALL THE DIMPLE DYES OR A BENCH. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A BOMBER BENCH AND TWO BOMBER BUCKETS? YEAH, THAT WOULD BE COOL. WE'RE GONNA LET YOU DO IT, MAN. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY TIME. YOU GET TO GO FREESTYLE, MAN. SO IF YOU CUT THE BODY SHOP OUT, YOU GOT MONEY TO SPEND ON MY SIDE. - THAT'S RIGHT. - HEY, I LIKE IT. ALL RIGHT, SO, REALLY, WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THIS THING? VIPER DRIVETRAIN, LAYING FRAME ON THE GROUND, COOL WHEELS AND TIRES. THEY GOT TO BE BIG. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY. - IT'S GONNA BE STUPID. - IT'S GONNA BE STUPID. I'M EXCITED FOR THIS ONE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU THINK WE CAN GET THIS THING TORE DOWN? I THINK WE GOT A BIG, DIRTY BOAT ON OUR HANDS. WITH THE MOTOR 90% OUT, I THINK IT'LL COME OUT QUICK. WHAT SCARES ME IS THE TRANNY. LET'S JUST JACK IT UP, PULL THE TRANNY OUT. OUR NORMAL ROUTINE COME ON, GET THEM BIG BADASS WRENCHES OUT, PAUL. THOSE ARE FOR PROTECTION. -IN CASE YOU GET LIPPY WITH ME. WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS I'M TAKING THE POWER-STEERING PUMP OFF BECAUSE THE LINES ARE STILL HOOKED UP. JUST TRYING TO ELIMINATE A BIG MESS. - REACH. - GOING, GOING, GOING, GOING. WE'RE GONNA GET THEM PANTS PULLED UP YET. OHH! BETTER NOT HAVE MY PANTS UP. DESIGNER JEANS. SEE, I WAS JUST GONNA HOLD YOU UP SO YOU CAN WORK ON THE CAR EASIER. I'M SCARED OF HEIGHTS, THOUGH. PULL THIS UP. I THINK WE'RE CLEAR. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOOD. WENT REALLY GOOD. THE MOTOR WAS ALL DRY, ALL FLUIDS. WE DIDN'T DRIP ANYTHING. AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S NO MESS ON THE FLOOR. MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. HEY, PAUL. COME HERE FOR A MINUTE. WE'RE HANGING OUT WITH PAUL WHEN THE 300 TIRES SHOW UP. SO WE FIGURED WHY NOT LET HIM HELP US WHEEL THEM OVER? YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT. I GUARANTEE IT. OH, YEAH. SURE. NOW PUT YOUR LEGS IN. NOW, TRY NOT TO BREATHE TOO MUCH WHEN YOU'RE IN THERE. CHECK HIS HIP FLEXIBILITY. I GOT REALLY BAD GAS TODAY. THIS IS GONNA BE BAD. OHH! HEY, SCOTT, I GOT THE NEW TIRE. THIS TIRE'S OUT OF ROUND. HE'S THE PERFECT BODY TYPE FOR TIRE ROLL. HEY, SOME HELP ROLLED IN. THE LITTLE LEPRECHAUN'S BACK. WE CALLED HIM "TEACUP." NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA CALL HIM? HOLY MAGICAL TIRES. YOU BROUGHT HELPERS. I'M JUST GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MEXICAN FOR LUNCH. I THINK IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF BALANCE. YOU'VE GOT THIS THING OUT OF ROUND. THANKS, TEACUP. MAN. HOLD ON. WE GOT A CIRCUS MONKEY. - GOT IT? - YEP. - YOU CAN DO IT. - COME ON, SHREKKIE. YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN DO IT. SHREK ATTACK! - OH, MAN! - LOOK AT THAT. WHEEL AND TIRE FITMENT IS 90% OF YOUR STANCE, AND YOUR STANCE IS 100% OF YOUR HOT ROD. SO WE'RE TEST-FITTING TIRES ON THE 300. AND NATURALLY, YOU WANT TO GO BIGGER IN THE BACK AND SMALLER IN THE FRONT. - READY? - YEAH. GO SLOW. WATCH YOUR HANDS. KEEP GOING. THAT'S ALL WE GOT. OKAY. COME OUT HERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WITH THE 22 IN THE FRONT, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN'T STEER. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT A PROBLEM RIGHT OFF THE BAT JUST BY YOUR WHEEL SIZE YOU PICK. 22s IN THE FRONT, IT'S WAY TOO STUFFED. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A MULLET. OR A SKULLET. OR CHARLES IN TIGHT JEAN SHORTS WITH A COMB IN THE BACK POCKET. THAT'S RIGHT. COWBOY BOOTS ON. RIGHT. LET'S PULL THE FRONT WHEEL OFF. WE'LL PUT A 20-INCH TIRE UP IN THE FRONT. LET'S SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. ALL RIGHT. WATCH YOUR NAIL POLISH. I AM. IT'S GOLD-FLAKE POLISH, TOO. WATCH OUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? - IT ACTUALLY DON'T LOOK BAD. - I LIKE IT. THE 20 IS ACTUALLY ROLLING THE WHEEL WELL PRETTY GOOD. I'LL HAVE TO DO A LITTLE TRIMMING ON THE WHEEL WELLS, I'M SURE, BUT I WON'T HAVE TO MOVE IN THE FRAME RAIL. ALL RIGHT, SO NOW YOU CAN GET ME SOME MEASUREMENTS. I'LL ORDER THE WHEELS TODAY. WE ENDED UP GOING WITH A 20 AND 22. YOU KNOW, IT ENDED UP BEING A BETTER PACKAGE. IT'S A MORE DRIVABLE CAR, AND IT'S GONNA LOOK GOOD WHEN IT'S HAMMERED ON THE GROUND. YOU GO BACK IN THE OFFICE WITH NOAH. I'M GONNA GO BACK IN THERE. I GOT SOME PAPER CUTS I GOT TO ATTEND. WELL, I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING IN TODAY. WHAT A GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY THIS FORD IS. SO, HOW LONG DID YOU SAY THE CAR'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY? SO IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR 85 YEARS. IT WAS PURCHASED IN BROOKLYN, AND IT WAS USED AS A FAMILY CAR. THIS MODEL "A" WAS MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S ON MY FATHER'S SIDE, SO I THINK MY MOM WILL ENJOY THIS MORE THAN ANYBODY. SHE'S GONNA BE BLOWN AWAY. IT WAS THE FIRST CAR MY FATHER LEARNED TO DRIVE IN AND GET HIS LICENSE IN. WOW. AND THEN MY UNCLE STEPH -- HE DROVE IT TO AND FROM HIGH SCHOOL, AND HE ENDED UP REBUILDING THE WHOLE THING FROM THE GROUND UP. I LOVE WORKING ON CARS THAT HAVE A RICH FAMILY HISTORY, SO WHAT BLAKE AND HIS STEPDAD, JOHN, ARE DOING -- IT'S JUST AN AWESOME THING. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN SEE HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB 'CAUSE THE CAR'S STILL IN GREAT CONDITION. YEAH, THANK YOU. BLAKE IS A CAR GUY, AND, YOU KNOW, I WANTED HIM TO BE PART OF THIS BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY WAS HIS FATHER'S CAR. SO IT'S JUST THE PASSION THAT HE HAS FOR IT AND THE MEMORY THAT COMES WITH IT THAT HIS FATHER IS PART OF THIS CAR, TOO. SO IN TERMS OF DRIVING IT, YOU GUYS ARE THINKING MAYBE CRUISING AROUND WHEN IT'S NICE OUTSIDE. YEAH, THIS HAS BEEN IN A BARN OUT IN THE COUNTRY FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW. IT USUALLY STARTS, BUT LATELY IT HASN'T BEEN STARTING. - OKAY. - IT'S BEEN LEAKING SOME OIL. OKAY. SPEAKING OF THAT, LET'S LOOK UNDER THE HOOD REALLY QUICK. WE HAVEN'T CHECKED THAT OUT. BACK TO A SIMPLER TIME WE GO. EVERYTHING'S INTACT, AND EVERYTHING'S THERE. SO WE'LL MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T LEAK TOO BAD. THEY ALL LEAK A LITTLE BIT. THEY'RE OLD CARS. SO WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SOLVE EVERYTHING THERE, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE'LL MAKE IT RELIABLE. SO WE'LL PRESSURE-TEST THE RADIATOR AND MAKE SURE ALL THE LINES AND THE HOSES ARE GOOD. WE DON'T WANT ANY GAS LEAKS, COOLANT LEAKS. - GOT TO HAVE GOOD BRAKES. - YEAH. WE'LL GIVE IT THE GOOD ONCE-OVER AND REPORT BACK. LET'S LOOK AT THE INTERIOR REALLY QUICK. ALL RIGHT. THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED A NEW FLOORBOARD, AND IN TERMS OF THE REST OF THE INTERIOR, IT'S KIND OF NICELY PRESERVED. I THINK WITH SOME CLEANUP, WE CAN STEAM-CLEAN THE SEATS AND THE DOOR PANELS AND COME A LONG WAY. IT'S REALLY COOL TO SEE A FAMILY THAT WANTS TO KEEP THIS CAR SO ORIGINAL AND PRESERVE IT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. UNLESS YOU GUYS GOT ANY FURTHER IDEAS, I THINK WE'VE GOT A SOLID PLAN. I'M GONNA GET THE GUYS ON IT. WE'RE GONNA LOOK OVER IT MECHANICALLY, AND I'LL REPORT BACK WHAT WE NEED TO DO. PERFECT. THANKS, NOAH. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. YEAH. WE'RE GONNA FIRE UP THE TORCH. WE'RE GONNA CUT OFF THE "U" BOLTS, CUT OFF ALL THE SPRING PERCHES, AND GET THE REAR END AND LEAF SPRINGS OUT. THEN WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME PUTTING THE NICE STUFF IN. IT'S TIME TO CUT SOME BOOM. GOT THE REAR END OUT OF THE 300. WE'RE GONNA CUT ALL THE LITTLE FACTORY WHEEL TUBS OUT OF THERE AND THEN HAND-FAB SOME BIG SHEET METAL ONES TO HOUSE THE MASSIVE MEATS. BAM! YEAH, HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?! WE'RE PUTTING A 22x12 IN THE BACK, AND THAT'S A MASSIVE TIRE. SO WE'VE GOT TO RAISE THE WHEEL WELLS AND WIDEN THE WHEEL WELLS. AND TO DO THAT, WE'VE GOT TO HAND-MAKE EVERYTHING. RIGHT NOW IT'S STEP ONE TO MANY STEPS IN BUILDING A WHEEL TUB. I NEED TO SEE IF I CAN EVEN GET THIS ALL THE WAY UP IN THE CAR. GOT TO TRIM IT DOWN SOME MORE. YEAH, IT'S FITTING REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW. WE'VE FINISHED SCREWING IT UP IN THERE AND MAKE EVERYTHING DRAW IN TIGHT AND EXPAND THAT WHEEL WELL TO THE ACTUAL FRAME OF THE CAR. AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND SPOT-WELD IT ALL IN. IT'LL BE GOOD. ON TO THE OTHER SIDE. CHARLES AND I ARE HEADED TO THE X2 VIPER WAREHOUSE, WHICH IS A 100,000-SQUARE-FOOT WAREHOUSE FULL OF ALL VIPER PARTS. WE'RE GONNA PICK OUT A NEW MOTOR FOR THE 300. THIS THING SHOULD BE PRETTY INSANE WITH THIS POWER PLANT. YEAH, SO I'VE BEEN KIND OF WANTING TO GO OVER TO THIS PLACE FOR A WHILE. HE'S THE LARGEST VIPER DISMANTLER IN THE WORLD. AND HE'S RIGHT HERE IN OUR BACKYARD. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE NEVER BEEN OVER THERE BEFORE. WE NEVER HAD A REASON TO GET A VIPER MOTOR. HOW CAN I HELP YOU GUYS TODAY? HEY, HOW YOU DOING? I'M NOAH. THIS IS CHARLES. YOU TALKED TO CHARLES ON THE PHONE. X2 BUILDERS DISMANTLES DODGE VIPERS. OVER THE YEARS, WE'VE DISMANTLED OVER 450 CARS AND SOLD HUNDREDS OF MORE RE-BUILDABLE VIPERS. YOU'VE GOT A VIPER MOTOR FOR MORE THAN EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. WE'VE GOT A COUPLE. - YEAH, THAT'S AWESOME. - WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR? I THINK WE WANT TO DO A GEN II. WE'RE USING A GEN II MOTOR BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE THE EASIEST ONE TO PUT IN THE CAR BUT STILL GIVES US ALL THE POWER WE NEED. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I GOT OVER HERE. - YEAH, LET'S CHECK THEM OUT. - YEAH, THANK YOU. THIS WOULD BE A GEN II. OKAY, THAT'S THE GEN II. ALL RIGHT. SO HOW DO YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GEN I AND A GEN II? THE ALTERNATOR ON A GEN I SITS IN THE MIDDLE. - OKAY. - OKAY. GEN II'S GONNA BE 450 HORSEPOWER. THAT'S GEN III? THAT WOULD BE A GEN III, YES. - OKAY. - THAT'S GEN IV. THAT'S GEN V. AND SO WHAT TYPE OF PROJECT DO YOU HAVE? CHRYSLER 300. 1962. I FIGURED WE'D DO SOMETHING MOPAR ON IT. AND CHARLES THREW OUT THE VIPER IDEA. HOW MANY OF THESE END UP IN BLOWN-UP VIPERS VERSUS, LIKE, TRANSPLANTS, LIKE WE'RE DOING? - MOSTLY TRANSPLANTS. - OH, REALLY? - YEAH. - REALLY? EVERYTHING, INCLUDING VW BUSES. -ALL RIGHT! SO, IS IT GONNA WORK FOR YOU? - YEAH. - I THINK THIS IS OUR GIRL. THIS THING'S GONNA BE AWESOME IN THAT CAR. WE WILL GET THE WIRING AND THE GAS TANK AND THE COMPUTER SYSTEM -- EVERYTHING READY TO GO FOR YOU. - YEAH. - AND WE'LL GET IT DELIVERED. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - APPRECIATE IT. - YEAH, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. THANKS FOR THE TOUR, ESPECIALLY. - IT'S GONNA BE COOL. - YEAH, THIS THING'S GONNA FLY. I GOT A FUN SURPRISE FOR SCOTT TODAY. IT'S A 450-HORSEPOWER 10-CYLINDER ENGINE. SCOTT. I SEEN THE CHERRY PICKER COME DOWN. I FIGURED I HAD A SURPRISE COMING. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? I TOLD YOU IT'S A UNICORN MOTOR. OH, THAT'S THE UNICORN HORN? YEAH. DON'T GET ALL EXCITED. THAT'S NICE. - UH-HUH. - THAT'S NICE. YOU WANT TO PULL THE COVER OFF? ARE YOU SCARED? NO. I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE HELL I'M UP AGAINST. HELL, YEAH! I JUST ASSUMED FOR SURE. I FOR SURE FIGURED IT WAS GONNA BE A LATE-MODEL HEMI GOING IN THE CHRYSLER. THIS IS JUST A ADDED LITTLE THING I -- YOU KNOW. WE'LL TAKE THE UNICORN OFF NOW. - DUDE, THAT'S COOL. - SEE? THIS VIPER MOTOR'S NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I EXPECTED A LATE-MODEL HEMI OR EVEN OLD-SCHOOL HEMI TO PUT IN THE FRONT OF THIS CHRYSLER, BUT VIPER MOTOR WOULD DEFINITELY BE COOL. THIS IS GONNA BE A TON OF WORK TO GET THIS THING TO FIT IN. THIS MOTOR'S, LIKE, A STREET-ROD PACKAGE RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. I MEAN, IT'S ALL COMPACT. NORMALLY WE ALWAYS MOUNT COILS REMOTELY LIKE THIS, TOO. YOU KNOW, IT'S COOL HOW IT'S ALL IN THE BACK. THIS THING'S LIKE IT'S ALREADY -- IT'S ALL TUCKED AWAY. WIRES ARE ALREADY HIDDEN. ALL THE FUN ACCESSORIES ARE TIGHT. YEAH, NOW I GET WHY YOU WERE TELLING ME TO MAKE SURE THE CROSSMEMBERS STAYED IN DEEP. YEAH. SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? MAYBE WE CAN JUST HANG THE MOTOR AS LEVEL AS WE CAN GET IT RIGHT IN THE HOLE AND SEE IF IT'LL EVEN FIT. IT'S A BIG FRONT END OF THE CAR, THOUGH. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. I'M HAPPY. I AIN'T NEVER MESSED WITH A VIPER MOTOR. I'M UP FOR THE CHALLENGE. - ALL RIGHT. - COOL. PULL THAT TOOLBOX OVER. I'LL GET MY GLOVES. A LITTLE BIT MORE. LOOKING GOOD. YEAH, I SAY DROP IT RIGHT THERE. GONNA BE A HELL OF A HOOD ORNAMENT. - OH, IT GOES DOWN IN THIS HOLE? - YEAH. MAN, IT'S SCRAPING THE HELL OUT OF THE FIREWALL. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S IT, MAN. I THINK THE HOOD WILL SHUT. SO, THIS ENGINE'S HUGE. I REALIZED IT WAS GONNA BE, LIKE, A LITTLE BIT BIG FOR THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, BUT NOT QUITE THIS BIG. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PULL THE BELL HOUSING OFF, SET THIS THING IN THERE, AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CUT INTO THE FIREWALL, TOO, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S WORTH IT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN. THERE YOU GO. - READY? - YEAH. SON OF A BITCH IS HUGE. TOLD YOU IT'LL FIT IN THERE. YEAH, WITH NO RADIATOR. - SEE? - DONE. BAM. BOOM. Shh! WELL, WE'RE HERE UNDER THE 300. I'M THINKING ALL ALONG I GOT A GREAT, BIG ENGINE BAY ON A GREAT, BIG CAR. WELL, THE VIPER MOTOR TURNED OUT TO BE A HOG. IT FILLED THE HOLE UP REALLY QUICK. SO TO A POINT WHERE I'M ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE TO CUT THE FIREWALL OUT, BRING THE MOTOR BACK A COUPLE INCHES TO GET ROOM FOR THE RADIATOR UP FRONT, THEN YOU CAN SEE RIGHT HERE THE TRANSMISSION TUNNEL IS TOO SMALL. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CUT THE FLOOR TUNNEL OUT, MAKE A BIGGER FLOOR TUNNEL, AND GET THE TRANNY TO FIT IN. LOTS OF WORK. LOTS, LOTS, AND LOTS OF WORK FROM HERE. I WAS TOLD ALL ALONG THIS WAS GONNA BE THE "SURPRISE" MOTOR. WELL, I GOT THE SURPRISES. GOT THIS MODEL A HERE. IT'S BEEN SITTING FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS. GUY WANTS TO GET IT RUNNING. BUT, YOU KNOW, SITTING THAT LONG, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND. WE'RE GONNA DIG INTO IT AND SEE WHAT'S UP. ALL RIGHT. - THAT WIRE FEELS PRETTY CRUSTY. LET ME DRAIN SOME GAS AND GET A TEST ON THAT. ALL RIGHT, TURN IT ON. - ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE ON. - WOW, LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. HERE, YOU WANT TO HOLD ONTO THAT? I DON'T WANT TO KNOCK IT OVER. - DO YOU WANT TO DRINK IT? - NO, I DON'T WANT A DRINK. - IT LOOKS LIKE COLD BEER, HUH? - COME ON, IAN. -YOU CAN DO IT. GOT THE CARB FOR THE MODEL A. PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER, BUT SHE CLEANED UP REAL GOOD. NO RESTRICTIONS, READY TO GO. FIRE THIS BITCH UP TODAY. PUT THE PLUGS IN IT, NEW CAP AND ROTOR, AND SEE IF SHE'LL LIGHT OFF. LOOK AT HOW PRIMITIVE THAT IS. AND THAT WORKS THE THROTTLE VALVE UP AND DOWN AND LETS YOU TURN IT. GAS PEDAL HOOKUP ON. THERE WE GO. LOOK AT THESE PLUGS, MAN. I'VE NEVER SEEN SPARK PLUGS LIKE THIS. I'D RATHER USE A WRENCH ON THESE THAN A REGULAR OLD SOCKET SO I DON'T BREAK THE PORCELAIN. YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL WITH THEM. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A DISTRIBUTOR CAP LIKE THIS BEFORE, BUT, HEY, BACK IN THE OLD DAYS, THEY WORKED. SHE'D GO ON THAT WAY. THEY DIDN'T HAVE WIRES BACK THEN. THEY HAD CABLES GOING TO THEM. SO WE GET TO SEE HOW SHE WORKS. WHOA, THAT AIN'T COOL. THERE WE GO. THE IGNITION SWITCH IS MESSED UP. HOPEFULLY IT'LL START. DON'T SOUND LIKE IT'S GONNA RUN. MIGHT BE SOME OTHER ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS WITH THAT IGNITION SWITCH. WHAT I FIGURED OUT IS THAT I HAD THE POINTS JUST A LITTLE TOO WIDE A GAP. SO I CLOSED THEM UP AND READY TO TRY HITTING IT, SEE IF IT'LL FIRE OFF AGAIN. I GUESS THEY HAD TO DO THIS QUICK ON THE SIDE OF THE ROADS. CRANK THIS BITCH UP. MAN, THIS IS TIGHT. WHOA! FORGOT ABOUT THAT SEAT BEING LOOSE. SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD FOR FOUR CYLINDERS. LISTEN TO THAT. PURRING LIKE A KITTEN. THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A FAT MAN FALL. NOW WE JUST GOT TO SEND IT OVER TO RALPH, GET IT DETAILED, AND IT'S READY TO GO. PUTTING THE MOTOR IN THE 300'S BEEN A CRAZY PROCESS. LOTS OF METALWORK. MOVING THE FIREWALL BACK. RAISING THE TRANSMISSION TUNNEL UP, THE DRIVESHAFT HOOP, THEN BUILDING THE CROSSMEMBERS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS. NOW WE CAN FINALLY GET ON TO DOING THE AIR-RIDE SUSPENSION. WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS BUILD SOME CUSTOM BRACKETS BECAUSE THE FRAME RAILS ARE SO NARROW 'CAUSE WE MINI-TUBBED THE THING. AND THE BRACKETS ARE SETTING ON AN OFF-CENTERED, NINE-INCH REAR END. SO ONE BRACKET'S UP ON THE REAR END, ONE'S DOWN. SO WE HAD TO BUILD SOME TOWERS TO GET THEM THINGS TO FIT COMPLETELY LEVEL. SO THINGS LOOK A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT AS LONG AS THEY'RE ALL LEVEL, FRONT TO REAR, AND SAME DISTANCE, FRONT TO BACK, EVERYTHING WILL WORK ON THE TOPSIDE. IN A NORMAL SITUATION, YOU'D ATTACH YOUR AIRBAG BRACKETS TO THE FRAME, BUT ON THE 300 SITUATION, WITH THE 22-INCH WHEELS, WE HAD TO GET THE CAR TO SIT LOWER. SO WE ACTUALLY BUILT A BRIDGE THAT WENT UP INTO THE TRUNK FLOOR. JUST TRYING TO GET THE SLIGHTEST TACK AS I CAN GET 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT THE SLAG TO BURN THE BAG. ON THAT BRIDGE, WE HAVE OUR MOUNTS. IT'S ALL OUR AIRBAG AND SHOCK MOUNTS, AND WHAT THEY DO IS ACTUALLY RAISE ALL THE SUSPENSION UP SIX INCHES ABOVE THE TRUNK FLOOR, AND THAT WAY WE CAN GET THE CAR TO SIT THAT MUCH LOWER. PUT THE RIDETECH 4-LINK IN, THE AIRBAGS IN, THE SHOCKS IN ON ALL OUR BRIDGE BARS, AND WE GOT A LITTLE DUMMY AIR LINE MADE UP WITH THE SCHRADER VALVE ON THE "T" FITTING. WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA DO IS JUST KIND OF MANUALLY PUMP IT UP AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY WITH THE AIR. WHEN IT PUMPS UP WITH THE AIR AND NOTHING'S BREAKING, NOTHING'S BINDING, EVERYTHING SEEMS GOOD, SHOCKS LIKE THE ANGLE THEY'RE AT, WE'RE GONNA LET IT ALL DOWN, TAKE IT ALL APART, AND T.I.G.-WELD IT ALL UP. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE FUN, MAYBE. MAYBE. WE'LL SEE. LOOK AT THAT. YEAH! - SWEET! YEAH! BRING IT DOWN SOME. WE'RE GONNA DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT. DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT. LOOK AT THAT. SWEET! THAT LOOKS HOTTER THAN GOLD TEETH TO ME. - THAT'S RIGHT. - I SAY NO BACK SEAT. JUST LET US SEE THE ACTION WORK. - PLEX. - PLEXIGLAS? - YEAH. - HELL, YEAH. THIS IS THE TRANSMISSION TUNNEL THAT'S GONNA BE IN THE CHRYSLER 300. IT'S ALL LAID OUT FLAT, CUT OUT OF SHEET METAL, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BEAD-ROLL IT. SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS LAY OUT THE PATTERN HERE, AND THEN I'M GONNA ACTUALLY DO ALMOST, LIKE, A DIAMOND-STITCH LOOK THAT YOU SEE IN NICE HIGH-END BENTLEY SEATS OR SOMETHING. NOW IT'S JUST A LOT OF BEAD-ROLLING LEFT TO DO. JUST HOLD IT, LIKE, CENTER LINE-CENTER LINE ON THERE, AND I'LL THROW A COUPLE TACKS ON IT. NOW IT'S GONNA BE SUPER-HARD TO TRY TO BEND, AND WE GOT TO BEND IT BY HAND 'CAUSE IF I PUT IT IN A SLIP ROLLER, IT'LL SMASH ALL THE BEAD ROLL THAT WE PUT IN IT COMPLETELY OUT AND BE A RUINED PIECE. I FEEL LIKE JANE FONDA DOING THE RICHARD SIMMONS WORKOUT. THAT'S HARD WORK FOR AN ICE CREAM CONE. AWESOME. - LOOKS GOOD. - YEP. - ALL RIGHT, SEE YA. WE'RE GETTING THERE. THANK YOU. HE'S GONE. NOW THE MAGIC CAN HAPPEN. SUPER HAPPY WITH THE TRANSMISSION TUNNEL. IT'S HUGE, BUT IT'S GOT A HUGE TRANSMISSION UNDERNEATH IT. HAPPY WITH THE WAY THE SHIFTER FELL RIGHT IN PLACE ON THE BEAD-ROLLED AREA THERE. REALLY NICE FIT ON THE WALL AND FLOOR, ALSO. FLOWS IN GOOD WITH THE BOX AT WHERE THE MOTOR'S RECESSED. SO WHAT WE GOT TO DO NOW IS JUST TACK IT ALL IN, MAKE SURE THE DASH STILL FITS, BUT I THINK, TRULY, WE HIT A HOME RUN WITH THIS ONE. WHEN WE DO SOMETHING THAT'S HANDMADE, IT'S DEFINITELY HANDMADE. MESSING WITH THE MODEL A. SERVICE DEPARTMENT GOT IT RUNNING, WHICH IS KIND OF FUN TO SEE. IT'S EVEN GOT THE ORIGINAL AH-OOGA HORN. BUT NOW IT'S MY TURN. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FRESHEN THE INTERIOR UP A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE GONNA TAKE SEATS OUT, SCUFF DOWN, REPAINT EVERYTHING THAT'S A LITTLE RUSTY. IT'S BEEN SITTING FOR A WHILE, AS YOU CAN SEE. ALWAYS LOOKING FOR DIAMONDS AND GOLD. ONLY THING I EVER FIND IS FRENCH FRIES AND M&M;'s. TAKE THESE LAST COUPLE OF PIECES OUT OF THE A AND GET IT OVER TO DETAIL. GOT REVERSE. REVERSE IS A LOT EASIER. JUST GOT THE MODEL A BACK FROM DETAILING. WE'RE GONNA PUT IT BACK TOGETHER, PUT THE INTERIOR BACK IN, AND HOPEFULLY FIRE IT UP THIS AFTERNOON, AND TAKE IT FOR A LITTLE SPIN. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. - SURE. - THAT'S GOOD. IT'S LIKE A LIBRARY IN HERE. JUST LAY IT BACK IN THERE NICE AND SOFTLY. LAID BACK. WELL, BRYAN, YOU DID A GOOD JOB. THE CARPET MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THE CUSTOMERS ARE REALLY GONNA LIKE THAT. COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT ME, RIGHT? - YOU MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. - I KNOW. WE'RE ON THE 300 HERE, AND I'M BACK TO DOING THE SHEET METAL AROUND THE BACK SEAT AREA. WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS START AT THE PACKAGE TRAY AT THE BACK WINDOW AND WORK FORWARD. AND I WANT TO WATERFALL THE METAL DOWN IN BETWEEN TWO BUCKET SEATS. EVERYTHING ON THIS CAR HAS BEEN MONSTER -- MONSTER MOTOR, MONSTER SUSPENSION, MONSTER WHEELS, MONSTER METALWORK. WELL, THE PACKAGE TRAY'S MONSTER, TOO, AND IN FACT, WE'RE DOING TWO 10s, TWO MID-RANGE, TWO TWEETERS ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BACK. AND THEN I'M GONNA THROW A MONSTER AMOUNT OF BEAD-ROLLING AROUND ALL OF THAT TO GO WITH THE REST OF THE BEAD-ROLL WORK THAT'S IN THE INTERIOR. WITH ALL OF THAT SAID, IT'S GONNA BE A BIG HEADACHE, AND I GOT TO TRY TO KNOCK IT OUT. SO HERE WE GO. IT TAKES LONGER TO LINE THE THING UP THAN IT DOES TO DO THE LINES. NOW THAT WE GOT THE PACKAGE TRAY ALL DONE, WE'RE GONNA BUILD A BADASS SHEET-METAL WATERFALL THAT ACTUALLY WRAPS AROUND TWO BUCKET SEATS THAT WILL BE THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR. THIS IS THE BACK-SEAT SURROUND. WE MADE ALL THE ATTACHMENTS. THIS ALL BOLTS DOWN WITH HIDDEN HARDWARE AND EVERYTHING. SO HOPEFULLY IT GOES IN THE WAY WE PLANNED. - IT'LL GO. - IT'LL GO. IT'S METAL. WE CAN HAMMER IT IF IT DON'T. GO DOWN JUST A HAIR. BOOM! HUH? IT'S FITTING REALLY GOOD. ALL OUR BOLTS ARE IN, DRAWING EVERYTHING NICE AND TIGHT. IT'S IN FOR GOOD. THAT'S FINAL FIT. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT THING. I GOT INTO METAL FAB AND ALL FABRICATION IN GENERAL BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I GREW UP POOR, AND WHEN YOU GROW UP POOR AND YOU WANT NICE THINGS, YOU GOT TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE THEM. MY FIRST BIG METAL JOB WAS ACTUALLY SOME LITTLE MINI BIKES. I JUST LIKE FORMING SHEET METAL, WHETHER IT'S BEAD-ROLLING OR JUST, YOU KNOW, SIMPLY ENGLISH WHEELING. I PERSONALLY LIKE MAKING MOTORCYCLE GAS TANKS. IT'S A LOT OF METALWORK GOES INVOLVED IN MAKING A NICE, SHAPELY, ROUND TANK. FITTING STEEL -- IT AIN'T REAL TO ME. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL HANDMADE. ONCE YOU GET THAT PART DONE, IT'S THE ONLY PART LIKE THAT IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN BUY OFF-THE-SHELF PARTS ALL DAY LONG, AND IF SOMEBODY REALLY WANTS YOUR CAR YOU JUST BUILT, THEY CAN BUY ALL THEM SAME PARTS AND BUILD THAT SAME CAR ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THAT SAME COLOR. BUT IF YOU HAND-MAKE MOST ALL YOUR PARTS, THEY CAN'T COPY THAT. SO WE'RE TURNING THE 300 INTO A HIGH-POWERED HOT ROD TO MATCH OUR SHOP TRUCK TIFFANY. WE'VE GOT A GEN II VIPER MOTOR. WE HAVE A CUSTOM TRANSMISSION TUNNEL MADE. AND I HAVE JASON DOING SOME CUSTOM PAINT TO TIE THIS WHOLE THING TOGETHER. THIS IS OUR SPECIAL INGREDIENT HERE, A LITTLE SECRET SAUCE. HOPEFULLY THIS MAKES IT LOOK LIKE METAL. SO LET'S SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. LET'S GO WITH IT. NOW THAT JASON'S FINISHED PAINTING THE ENGINE FOR THE 300, IT'S TIME TO PUT EVERYTHING BACK TOGETHER AND DROP IT IN PLACE. MAN, THESE ARE LIGHT. THE VALVE COVERS FOR THE VIPER -- THEY HAD A FACTORY RED-TINTED POWDER COAT TO THEM, AND, YOU KNOW, EVERY VIPER MOTOR YOU EVER SEE HAS GOT RED ON THEM. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TRY TO CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE BIT, AND WE WILL COME UP WITH THE LITTLE MIX OF COLORS HERE AND GOT, LIKE, AN ANODIZED METAL LOOK TO IT, ALMOST LIKE A CAD-PLATING LOOK. TURNED OUT REALLY COOL. I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE ANOTHER ONE LIKE IT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER. AS LONG AS WE DON'T SEE ANOTHER ONE LIKE IT 'CAUSE IT'S TOO UGLY. YEAH. WE GOT ALL THE STUFF BACK FROM PAINT. WE GOT THAT ALL PUT BACK ON THE MOTOR. WE'RE GETTING READY TO RAISE THE MOTOR UP AND DROP IT IN THE CAR. ON FINAL ASSEMBLY, IT WON'T HAVE TO COME OUT ANYMORE. JUST KEEP ADDING THE PARTS TO IT. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, WE'LL BE FIRING THIS THING UP. - OH, MY GOSH. - ALL RIGHT, THERE IT IS. TRY TO HOLD THE BALANCE ON THAT MOTOR. TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF OF IT. - IS THAT ALL? - YEAH, I'M GONNA MOVE THE CHAIN. OKAY, YOU READY? YEAH. OKAY. I'M IN. - THERE YOU GO. - ARE WE OVER? GOOD ENOUGH. YEAH. WE GOT THE ENGINE IN THE 300. NOW WE GOT IT UP IN THE AIR. WE'RE ON TO PUTTING THE TRANSMISSION IN. THE TRANSMISSION IS ALSO A VIPER SIX SPEED RIGHT OUT OF THE CAR THAT THE MOTOR COME FROM. SO ALL BADASS STUFF TO MOVE THIS BIG BOAT OF A CAR DOWN THE ROAD. SO IT'LL BE PRETTY NEAT. OKAY, WE'RE ON THE 300 HERE, AND RANDY'S PRETTY MUCH GOT ALL THE FABRICATION OF MAKING THE RADIATOR FIT AND THE SHROUD AND GETTING ALL THE ACCESSORIES BOLTED ONTO THE FRONT. SCOTT'S BUTTONING UP THE AIR CLEANERS HERE. I'M PLUGGING SOME MORE WIRING IN. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO LIGHT THIS THING UP. I THINK WE OUGHT TO TRY IT. ALL RIGHT. - WOW. - THAT WAS TOO EASY. RIGHT THERE. LET'S GO, MAN. - WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR. - WHOO! WHERE'D THEY MAKE THE EXHAUST? WHAT? - YEAH! - I CAN'T HEAR. SOUNDS GOOD. THE VIPPER'S ON FIRE! YOU LIKE THAT? LOOK AT THAT. - WHOO-HOO! - LISTEN TO IT REAL CLOSE. VIPPER, BABY! RIGHT THERE! SO IT'S FINALLY TIME TO SHOW TRUDY HER 1934 MODEL A. I THINK SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT. THIS CAR'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOREVER. HEY, HEY! HOW YOU GUYS DOING? - WOW. - THIS IS AWESOME. WOW, IT LOOKS SO GREAT. THIS CAR, WHICH WE CALL "LIZZY," HAS BEEN IN OUR FAMILY SINCE 1931. THE GREAT THING IS FOR THESE TWO GUYS, THEY'RE THE GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN OF THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE. IT'S SUCH A GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY FOR MY CHILDREN, AND IT WILL GO DOWN TO THE NEXT GENERATION. WE KNEW IT WAS AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE TO THE FAMILY, SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AFTER WAS PRESERVATION. WE SPENT A WHILE JUST GOING THROUGH, POLISHING OUT THE CAR. THE BLUE AND THE BLACK LOOK SO GREAT. YOU KNOW, WHEN IT CAME IN, IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ONE COLOR BECAUSE IT WAS ALL KIND OF DULL. OUR DETAILER, RALPH -- HE WENT AT IT AND REALLY GOT IT TO SHINE AGAIN. IT LOOKED JUST UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE THAT CAR THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED IN THE '30s. IT SHOWS ITS AGE, BUT IT LOOKS VERY ELEGANT. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A FEW THINGS WE'VE DONE. I'LL OPEN UP THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT FOR YOU. COOL. WE DID A COMPLETE TUNE-UP. WE REBUILT THE CARBURETOR. WE REDID SOME WIRING. WE'VE GOT ALL NEW FLUIDS, AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE TIMING. SO ALL THAT'S RIGHT. - WHAT HORSEPOWER IS IT? - IT'S ABOUT 50 HORSEPOWER. SO I'D STAY AROUND TOWN WITH IT. YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE INTERIOR? IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IN HERE, BUT WE WENT THROUGH AND CLEANED EVERYTHING. WE REPLACED A COUPLE FLOORBOARDS AND ACTUALLY PUT SOME CARPETING IN IT FOR YOU. SO NICE, NEW CARPETING. WE LOVE IT. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE MORE THING LEFT TO DO. THAT'S GO FOR A TEST DRIVE. TRUDY, JOHN, YOU WANT TO GO CHECK IT OUT? - LET'S DO IT. - ALL RIGHT. OKAY. THE NEAT THING ABOUT THIS CAR IS KIND OF LIKE A TIME CAPSULE. IT'S SO COOL TO DRIVE AN OLD CAR LIKE THIS. AND LOOK AT THIS BIG STEERING WHEEL. WITHOUT POWER STEERING, WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME LEVERAGE FROM SOMEWHERE. OH, THAT'S WHY THEY MADE IT BIG. IT'S NICE TO KEEP THESE THINGS ON THE ROAD, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE VEHICLE'S BEEN IN YOUR FAMILY FOR SO LONG. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CAR TO DRIVE, AND IT JUST GIVES YOU THE FEELING LIKE, "THIS IS SOMETHING SPECIAL." SCOTT. HEY! GOT THE HOOPS! BRING IT IN. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? HERE, GRAB THIS THING. IT'S HEAVY. WOW! YOU LIKE THAT? HELL, YEAH. - LOOK GOOD? - YOU LIKE THEM? THROW IT ON THE BACK. I WANT TO SEE HOW THIS THING LOOKS. - LOOK AT THAT. - CHECK THAT OUT. WE CAN GO STRAIGHT IN. DOES IT CLEAR? IT CLEARS. OH, YOU GOT PLENTY OF ROOM. - BE COOL. - IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY. - YEAH. - I LOVE IT. WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO IS PAINT THE CENTER OF THE TRIM THE COLOR OF THE WHEEL. THEN WE'LL HAVE THE ENGINE, THE TRIM, THE WHEEL, THE FRONT GRILLE ALL THE SAME COLOR. - KIND OF TIE IT ALL TOGETHER. TIE IT ALL TOGETHER. SO YOU'RE TALKING PAINTING THE WHOLE WHEEL. NOT JUST THE CENTER. THE WHOLE WHEEL, RIGHT? WE WANT TO PAINT THE WHOLE WHEEL. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S COOL. I THINK ONCE THEY'RE PAINTED, THEY ACTUALLY LOOK DEEPER. RIGHT. SO... - ALL RIGHT. - COOL. IT'S TIME TO DO IT. SO WE'RE GETTING READY TO PAINT THE 300 WHEELS. THEY CAME IN. THEY WERE POLISHED ALUMINUM, WHICH LOOKED REALLY NICE BUT DIDN'T REALLY SUIT THE CAR. WE SCUFFED THEM DOWN. WE'RE GONNA SPRAY SOME EPOXY ON THEM AND THEN SILVER, THEN GOLD PEARL. AND THEN FLAT CLEAR. THAT'LL GIVE A REALLY KIND OF A TOUGH APPEARANCE THAT GOES WITH THE REST OF THAT CAR, AND IT'S ONE OF OUR FINAL LAST DETAILS THAT WE'RE GONNA DO. THIS IS THE LAST THING THAT WE GOT ON THE CHRYSLER HERE. INSTEAD OF PAINTING THE WHOLE CAR, WE WANT TO LEAVE THE PATINA ON IT. SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND PAINT THE TRIM, KIND OF TIE IT IN WITH THE WHEELS, AND THEN TRY TO BRING THE WHOLE CAR TOGETHER AS ONE NICE MASTERPIECE. SO TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE 300. REMIND ME A LITTLE BIT, LIKE, WHEN YOU BOUGHT THE CAR. SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS AGO, BOUGHT IT OFF OF eBAY. IT SAT AROUND FOR TWO YEARS. PROCEEDED TO HAVE IT STOLEN BY THE GUY WHO WAS DOING A DISC BRAKE CONVERSION. - RIGHT. - FOUND IT, REPOED IT BACK. BRIAN'S 300 HAS HAD A PRETTY ROUGH LIFE, BUT IT'S GOT A NEW HEART, A KILLER STANCE, AND A ONE-OFF INTERIOR. I THINK BRIAN'S GONNA FLIP OUT. WE WANTED TO KIND OF DO SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF TIFFANY. YEAH. AND WE KIND OF DID, BUT WE ALSO GAVE IT A COMPLETELY NEW IDENTITY. SO DESPITE ITS PAST, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ROCKY AT TIMES... ALWAYS. ...I FEEL LIKE WE'VE COME FULL CIRCLE AND THE CAR IS VERY HAPPY AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE HAPPY, AS WELL. YEAH, SHE'S HAD A LONG ROAD.LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT. ALL RIGHT, DUDE. LET'S DO IT. - THERE IT IS. - YEAH! YEAH! THREE-TRIPLE-O-O. NICE! THERE YOU GO. WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, MY GOD, IT'S AMAZING. WE HAD TO DO A LOT OF TO MAKE IT LAY ON THE GROUND. BUT IT TUCKS THE WHEELS REALLY, REALLY HARD, AND IT RIDES SUPER-SUPER-LOW WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO. THE WHEEL FITMENT'S ON POINT. SCOTT BACK-HALFED THE ENTIRE CAR SO WE COULD FIT THESE 22-INCH WHEELS. THEY'RE 22x12, PUSHING 13 INCHES. THEY TUCK WAY UP IN THERE. THEY DON'T HIT ANYTHING. WE MADE CUSTOM WHEEL WELLS FOR IT. UP FRONT, WE BUILT A TOTALLY CUSTOM SUSPENSION. THEY DON'T MAKE ANYTHING. WE GOT A RACK-AND-PINION, CUSTOM CONTROL ARMS, AND AIRBAGS ALL THE WAY AROUND. SO YOU CAN LAY IT DOWN LOW. GOT GOOD BRAKES ALL THE WAY AROUND. HUGE SIX-PISTON FRONT, FOUR-PISTON IN THE REAR. MAN, IT FREAKING RIPS. IT'S A LOT OF METAL TO MOVE DOWN THE ROAD, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT... SHE'S A BOAT. WE GOT TO CHECK OUT THE MOTOR. YEAH. LOOK AT THE GRILLE. THE VIPER MOTOR. SO WE TOOK THIS THING. IT SHOVED WAY BACK INTO THE FIREWALL. AND THEN SURROUNDING IT, A BUNCH OF BADASS METALWORK. YOU'VE GOT A GEN II VIPER MOTOR. OKAY.450 HORSEPOWER. YOU GOT THE T-56 MAGNUM TRANSMISSION THAT WENT WITH IT. AND THEN OUT BACK, WE'VE GOT A FORD NINE-INCH REAR END. SO IT IS A STOUT DRIVETRAIN, AND IT'S A BLAST TO DRIVE. LET'S CHECK OUT THE INTERIOR REALLY QUICK. ALL RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE DID. HOLY SO WE WANTED THE INTERIOR TO COMPLEMENT THE EXTERIOR. SO WE WENT WITH AN INDUSTRIAL LOOK, A LOT OF UNFINISHED METAL, BUT IT'S ALL HANDMADE. WE'VE GOT COVERS FOR THE SEAT BASES, THE BACKS OF THE SEATS. THE TRANSMISSION TUNNEL WE HAD TO MAKE MUCH, MUCH BIGGER. IT'S ENORMOUS. IT'S ENORMOUS BECAUSE THAT TRANSMISSION HAS A MASSIVE BELL HOUSING ON IT. YEAH. BACK, WE'VE GOT A WATERFALL KIND OF SETUP COMING OFF THE REAR PACKAGE TRAY, WHICH HOUSES AN ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS STEREO SYSTEM, SO THIS THING FREAKING ROCKS. NICE, CLEAN FREAKING LOOK. VERY, VERY UNIQUE. NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE ANYTHING ELSE LIKE IT. THE AIR-RIDE CONTROLS ARE IN THE CENTER CONSOLE. THERE YOU GO. YOU'RE PROBABLY IN GEAR. YEAH, SO IF YOU HOLD 2 DOWN AND JUST LET OFF, IT'LL START ADJUSTING. - TOTALLY. - THERE YOU GO. "WHERE AM I?" IT SAYS. WAIT A SECOND, I WANT TO SEE THIS THING OUTSIDE. YEAH. HOLY... SO THAT IS YOUR, LIKE, ROLL-AROUND RIDE HEIGHT RIGHT THERE. IT CLEARS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING, AND IT'S STILL SITTING REALLY LOW TO THE GROUND. LET'S GO DRIVE THIS THING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S FREAKING DO IT. ALL RIGHT, NICE. IT'S TIME TO DRIVE THE 300. WE'VE GOT THE STREETS CLOSED DOWN. I GOT A FEELING BRIAN'S GONNA DRIVE THIS THING LIKE A MANIAC THROUGH DOWNTOWN ST. LOUIS. ONCE YOU GOT INTO SECOND GEAR, ALL YOU HEARD WAS MOTOR. IT WAS NOISY. IT WAS GRITTY. IT WAS ANGRY, AND I LOVED IT. IT GOES THROUGH THE GEARS NICE AND EASY. COMING UP AROUND HERE. IT'S A FREAKING CRUISER, MAN. BIG-ASS CRUISER. IT'S ACTUALLY GOT SOME GIDDY-UP AND GO. IT'S GOT A LOT OF GIDDY-UP AND GO. IT'S A LITTLE ROWDY. SHE'S A DIRTY GIRL. I LIKE THE WAY IT'S GEARED, TOO. IT'S PRETTY AGGRESSIVE. THING SCREAMS, DOESN'T IT? HOLY IT DOES. IT PULLS. YOU'RE LIKE, "HOLY" THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT, MAN. GOOD SICK. WHOA. SHE'S BACK. THERE YOU GO. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HIGH FIVE. DOUBLES. I LOVE IT. THAT'S GREAT. YEAH, YOU KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK, MAN. THE GEN II VIPER MOTOR -- I MEAN, THAT'S A HIGH-PERFORMANCE PIECE OF MACHINERY, AND MAKING IT WORK IN A BIG '60s BOAT IS THE PERFECT COMBINATION IN MY WORLD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE ON THE ROAD LOOKS LIKE THIS. NOTHING. THIS THING IS FOR THE CONFIDENT MAN. THEY WANT SOME CRAZY PERFORMANCE ON THAT NOTE, WE SHOULD GO AND DRIVE IT AROUND AGAIN 'CAUSE I WAS HAVING WAY TOO MUCH DAMN FUN. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT. I'M OUT!
