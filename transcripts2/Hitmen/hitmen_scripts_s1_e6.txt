 Do you think this is right? Well, Mr K said to meet Nikhil here, so I guess so. Do we really need another person? Well, apparently it's a big job today, and Nikhil is supposed to be the best. So we need to be totally focussed. Totally. - Yeah? - Yeah. Good. You hungry, Fran? Um, a bit I guess, yeah. A little bit.

 I made you an egg sandwich. I dread to think how long that's been sweating in that glove box. Made it specially for you, so you might just wanna have a bite. Go on, have a bite. (SQUELCH) (LAUGHS) Ooh. I love April Fool's! Of course you do. It's basically Christmas for idiots. There is a lot more where that came from. - Yeah. - I've got the fly in the ice cube... Remember the glasses and the moustache and... - Yeah. - Oh, my! And a whoopee cushion. Obvs. Er, we've got the fake gun. Jamie, that's a real gun.

 Oh. Er... Oh. Bang! (LAUGHS) - "Bang." Ohh. - Look, can you just stop? I need this to go well. The rest of my life's a total mess. Dare I ask, how is that Joao situation? Actually, it's... it's improved. It's sort of sorted now, really. We've agreed that, um, he's gonna keep the flat and I get the sofa. Unfortunately the sofa's in the flat and he's got the keys, but... - I mean... - Sounds a bit tricky, mate, but... Do you know what? Change can actually be a really good thing. You know, like I've changed from brushing my teeth to just popping a few Smints. I won't lie, I had noticed that difference. I want to make a deal with you. You cut yourself some slack and I'll start brushing my teeth. - Yeah? - Great. Deal. - (BUZZ) - Ow! What? (LAUGHS) Just stop it. No more pranks. Please. Right, um, do you think that's him? God, he looks terrifying. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING CONTINUES) (CRACK) Open door! - Open the fucking door! - Open the door. (DOOR SLIDES OPEN) (THUD) (BREATHES HEAVILY) Good morning. I am Nikhil. (CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY) BOTH: Good morning, Nikhil. So, um, what about you, Nikhil? Um... - Is there a Mrs Nikhil? - Dead. God, I'm so sorry. Um... - Kids? - Dead. - Pets? - Two gerbils. - Aw, that's nice. - Both dead. (INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY) One target down. - Only seven more. - Seven?! Our witness in court case. We hit all by tomorrow morning. Nikhil, if you're hungry... - (WHISPERING) Jamie, no. No. - 'Cos I've got, um, a really delicious egg sandwich with your name on. (MUNCHING) OK, target number two in flat over wall. (DEATH METAL PLAYS THROUGH HEADPHONES) - Hm. That's a big wall. - Big wall. - (MUSIC STOPS) - What's the plan? Well, I think you should give me a leg up. Oh, I gave you a leg up last time. Er, no, you didn't 'cos I distinctly remember I gave you a leg up when you'd trodden in dog shit and it was all over my hands. Oh, yeah. Let's play a game. I'm gonna think of a person and if you can guess who I'm thinking of, - then I will give you the leg up. - That's ridiculous. - Why? - Because it's like - a one in seven billion chance I'll get it right. - OK, we'll narrow it down to... - the people in this van. - Fine. - Is it me? - Wait, I'm not ready yet. OK, go. - Is it me? - Yes. Yes, it is me. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS) - (MUSIC STOPS) - Done. We go now. (WHISPERING) I didn't even know he left the van. (WHISPERING) He's incredible. (WHISPERING) Incredible at killing people, maybe. (WHISPERING) But I bet he can't guess who I'm thinking of. - One who look like weakling schoolboy. - (CHUCKLES) (DEATH METAL PLAYS THROUGH HEADPHONES) - Does he mean me? - (WHISPERING) Yeah. (WHISPERING) Wow. He's good. (ENGINE STARTS) (SPLASH) - Nice work. - No touch. - Sorry. - (MOBILE PHONE VIBRATING) - I should get this. - I check body go down. Mr K? Yeah, no, we're up and running. Nikhil? Very efficient. Mm. Er, yeah. I mean, Jamie's really busy doing, um... er, stuff. Yeah, she's... she's super on it. Um, yeah, I'll check in when we're done. OK. Are you going to do anything today? - I've come up with the perfect way to trick him. - I mean, anything useful. One Martini, extra fly. - I don't think he's gonna see that coming. - Jamie, you've got to stop this, it's embarrassing. We're starting to work like professionals for once - and if you can't help, then just don't get in the way. - Fine. So, where to next, Nikhil? (LOUD FART) It's a whoopee cushion. Next location, security camera here, here and here. We go in back way. Bang, bang, bang. You cover me. - Sounds like a plan. - (VEHICLE APPROACHES) What about me? - You wait here. - (DOORS CLOSE) Fran. We going for that drink or what? - What? So you just abandon me in the middle of nowhere again? - Oh, come on. Looks like that long Highland hike did you good. Yeah. That's probably the stone I lost due to crippling diarrhoea from drinking from a stream. But... thanks. Go away. Who's your friend and what's with his frickin' do? That's Nikhil. Mr K asked us to work with him today. Wow. The Nikhil. So Mr K sent you a babysitter. That's adorable. Yeah, uh... We don't... Well, he's not a babysitter. I mean, we've got a lot of work on so... - Does he give you a snack after school? - (LAUGHS) Does he read you a bedtime story? (LAUGHS) Yeah, does he read you a bedtime story? - I just said that, Charles. - Oh, yeah. Does he like... record the story on audiobook maybe? - It's the same thing, Charles. - Yep. Final warning. Hey, Jamie, who's this? (IMITATES NIKHIL) Final warning. (LAUGHS) That is so Nikhil. Charles is a very gifted impressionist. (IMITATES NIKHIL) Final warning. I am big, scary man - with mullet and muscles... - Charles, grow up, we're working. (IMITATES FRAN) Charles, grow up, we're working. - Argh! - Hey! Please! I have a really delicate trachea! - Apologise to schoolboy lady. - Who? He means me, but it's... it's a sign of respect. I'm sorry. (GRUNTS) Sorry, Fran! Sorry, Fran! - (CHOKING) - Probably enough. (GRUNTS) - Ready to work? - Let's do it.

I won't fucking tell you again! (INHALES) I was thinking of dropping you and your partner. But then Nikhil lost his number two last week... attack of conscience, such a shame... so you're in luck. Well, I... I... can't wait to get started. Well, then, congratulations! I suppose the only thing now is for you to do a bit of streamlining of your own. (SAWING CONTINUES) Tie up the loose end. Sorry, um, loose end's not quite... Yes, what's-her-name? Jamie. Jamie? No, you can't... Do we have a problem here? No, there's no problem. Lekker.

I can't believe we're on the run. Where are we gonna go? Don't know. I mean, - anywhere we just blend in, I guess. - Japan. I should get rid of this, you know? Mr K will be able to track us. (MOBILE PHONE VIBRATING) - Oh, God, it's Liz. - Good luck. (MOBILE PHONE CONTINUES VIBRATING) Liz. - Fran. - Liz. You still playing hard to get or do you wanna stop fucking around and grab that drink tonight? Can't tonight, I'm afraid. - We're off on holiday. - Interesting. - Where? - Not Japan. Er, not that Japan isn't nice, but not Japan. We don't know. I really hope you're around when I get back. Me too. Bye, Fran. Fran, are we gonna be OK? Of course we are. We'll stick together, we've got each other. Aw. You know... you really need to start brushing because those Smints just aren't cutting it. They really aren't. (CHUCKLES) Don't laugh, it makes it worse. - (LAUGHS) - It's disgusting. Mr K, it's me, your number one. It's Liz. Liz and Charles Liz. We got the location. We'll get on their tail. I'll call you when it's done. - Let's move, Charles! - Yes, mamacita. [ARCADE FIRE: Rebellion (Lies)]
