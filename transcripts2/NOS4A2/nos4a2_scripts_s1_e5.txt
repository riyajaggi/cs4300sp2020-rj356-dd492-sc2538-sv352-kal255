 I didn't know who else to call. It's okay. I was up. You can't sleep? Not since Daniel. I just can't stop thinking about Sharon, out there in that field. When the police come back to you, stick to your story. Bing killed Sharon, he knows who took Haley. I already gave them a statement.

 Why would they come back? To fill the hole in your story. A hole the size and shape of a magical Bridge. You tell them that's how you found Sharon. Or that a man with a magical car wants to meet you. Charlie Manx. That's his name. Get some sleep, Brat. You're gonna need it. Vic?

 You know, uh... I got to tell you, kind of scared me in the garage this morning. I'm sorry. I'll clean it up. On my first tour in Kuwait, I was a driver in an armored truck convoy. And, uh... I'd been there a couple weeks, you know, getting the hang of it, doing good, you know? Feeling okay. Things almost seemed normal, you know? And then, um... Then lead truck in the convoy gets blown sky high. And later, I... I recognized Ricky Giblin's hand, because we got the same tattoo one night, being stupid, you know? I was your age. - It's not the same, Dad. - Hold on. I never talked about it. I just, um... And that... you know, it poisoned me. Just keeping everything inside. I don't want that for you. I'm okay. I am. If you want to talk about... Haley, you know... want to talk about Sharon, anything, Vic, I'm here for you. It's okay to talk about stuff. Dad... Yeah? I'm fine. I am. I'm just tired. Okay. All right. Jesus, Vicki. Did you get any sleep at all? I told you to ice that eye. I just came to pick up my bike. Maybe we should start to think about a car for you, huh? I prefer my bike. You're out riding it at all hours, you always come back sick... All right, no, I won't do that anymore. What were you doing in that field? Were you with Craig? What? No. Look, Mom, can we... can we not do this? I'm tired. I just want to get my bike and go to class. What's the hold up? That death trap you bought her's gotta go. - No, I need my bike. - Vic's a great rider. Oh, she's a great rider? Have you seen your daughter's eye, Chris? Yeah, discussed it. She's fine. Oh, you discussed it. Oh, you're a doctor now. This is very good to know. You know, you and Tiffany, you should open a practice together. You'd really clean up. Victoria McQueen? Yeah. I'm Detective Tabitha Hutter. I've been assigned to the Sharon and Haley Smith case. Is, uh... Is this a bad time? Let's start with Sharon Smith's body. How did you find it? Uh, well, I was... - riding home on my dirt bike... - Mm-hmm. ...when I saw these, um... all these crows, like, pecking around in the dirt. And, uh... Yeah, it was Sharon. So, you saw some crows, stopped on your dirt bike, and... decided to dig? Yes. Where were you coming from? Bing Partridge's house. Bing Partridge. The 42-year-old custodian you allege committed the murder. And helped kidnap Haley, yeah. Have you arrested him? What were you doing at his home? We trade comic books. I wanted to return an issue he loaned me. You're friends with a middle-aged custodian. We're not friends anymore. Did you see Bing kill Sharon or dispose of the body? No, but he said he made her clean. And then after, Bing, he just let you go? No, I escaped. You escaped on your dirt bike, stumbled across some crows, dug up Sharon Smith's body, and assumed Bing Partridge dumped her there? Yes. I'm telling you the truth. Maybe. You're just, um... not telling me all of it. Okay, you need to arrest Bing Partridge. Here's my card... in case you remember anything else. I was gonna redo the kitchen with these. I'll get some turpentine. Yeah, that's... that's not gonna help them. These are ruined. Damn, girl, I worked extra shifts for months to buy this linoleum. Well, I will pay you back. Yeah. You're in high school. I'm sorry, Tiffany. Yeah, I'm sorry, too, Vic. I'm sorry for what you saw, but... What I saw was my neighbor, Sharon, murdered, naked, with a nail in her head. Her daughter is missing, Tiffany, but by all means, please, go on... tell me more about your linoleum. Yeah, I didn't... I-I didn't sign up this. All right, ladies, the garage can wait. I got grinders. Ham, cheese, extra pickles, Coke for the Brat. Italian works diet 7-Up for my baby baby. Oh, you know, your "baby baby" was just telling me that she, uh... she didn't sign up for this. I think she meant me. What? No. No, I'm sure that's not what she meant. Tiff? She... She should be with her mother. Well, is that what you think? That I should live with Mom? I'm your daughter. Okay. Bing Partridge, I know you're in there. I advise you open the door. What's going on here, Bing? Why weren't you outside to greet me when I arrived? Something's happened, Mr. Manx. Something bad. Would you like to take a seat? I'll stand. Tell me what happened. I hope you won't be angry. Does it, perchance, have anything to do with Vic McQueen? I was real careful hiding the mother. But Vic found her. Did she now? She told the police. They came by and left a card in my door. And you were hiding from them? I'm so sorry, Mr. Manx. I understand if you want to fire me. Fire you? For goodness sake, what kind of a monster do you take me for? Body disposal is, by far, the most difficult aspect of your job. Thank you, sir. Neither you nor I could have foreseen the resourcefulness of our intrepid Vic McQueen. Vic says what I did to the mother was wrong. Then, obviously, she had no idea what was going on inside that house. You found a prophylactic in the living area, did you not? Where young Haley, a child of 10, could have discovered it? It... It was in the trash can. It was used. That wanton didn't deserve to be called "mommy." You saved that child's life, Bing. There will always be those who don't understand the work we do, but we can't let their permissive attitudes prevent us from saving even one child. Now chin up. You're going to the police. You want... You want me to turn myself in? I-I don't like policemen, Mr. Manx. I find it always best to face your problems head-on. No more hiding. Tell me, what is the name of your favorite television program? "Monster Trucks." And was "Monster Trucks" on last night? - All night, every night. - Perfection. Now listen closely, Bing Partridge, because what you do next will determine the future of our relationship. I... I work for uh, Massachusetts Custodial and Security Services. They... They send me to two places. I did my shift at SoChemPharm, and then I headed to William White Memorial High School, a-and then home. I watched television all night long. "Monster Trucks." It's my favorite show. And th-then I got up, and I did the same thing all over again. Anyone who can confirm all that? Both... Both my supervisors. And Victoria McQueen. When did you see Victoria McQueen? She came by yesterday to return a comic book. She's my friend. That all? Are you... more than friends? No. You ever wish you were? Vic's a pretty girl. No. She's not a pretty girl? Yes... No. Yeah, she is. - It's just... - "Just"? She's in high school. She's 18, age of consent. Tell me about the youth facility. Those records are sealed. You weren't much younger than Vic when you went in, were you? Those records are sealed. Was your crime sexual in nature, Bing? I work for Massachusetts Custodial and Security Services, and they send me to two places. I did my shift at SoChemPharm, and then I headed to William White Memorial High School, and then home. I watched television all night long. - "Monster Trucks"... - Yeah. Yeah, your favorite show. I told you there was something wrong with that guy. No one ever believes me, but I'm a pretty good judge of character. Or nobody ever believes you 'cause you're always stoned. Well, that's what your mom thinks you're doing in the woods. You found Sharon with that Bridge, didn't you? I know I promised not to use it again. But I didn't have a choice, okay? I said it once, I said it a thousand times... your heart's too big, Vic. Too big and too dumb. You wanna get outta here? Play hooky for once in your life, please? Come on. Craig, I have to finish this portfolio so I can get out of here for good. RISD. You should apply, too. Yeah, we both know the only reason I took this class was to be near you. You're the best part about this town, Vic. And I don't know what I'm gonna do without you. Well, there's a party later at Willa's if you wanna come. Tea and crumpets gonna be there? I'd rather go swimming at Amity Island. Craig. They got city hands, Chief. Been counting money all their lives. Okay, you are not Captain Quint. Okay, I bet those pricks never even seen "Jaws." It's a classic. Yeah, I'll see you later, nerdball. Craig. You're supposed to be in jail. Murmur, chitchat, gossip, prattle. Everyone knows true friends don't tattle. We're not friends, Bing. That lady policeman you snitched to, she doesn't have any evidence. Mr. Manx says I did nothing wrong. Then Mr. Manx is a liar. _ He says come alone. He's a Strong Creative that's been taking kids for decades, and still nobody has found them. I think he's taking them to his Inscape. Maybe if we find out what that is, your Bridge can take us there. Maybe it can't. Last time I tried, it took me to Bing's. You were looking for Haley. And she was in the Wraith. What if your Bridge can only take you to a fixed point? It's a Bridge, right? It can't take you to a moving car. He must've left Bing's right before I got there. Tomorrow... you have to find out as much about his Inscape as you can. I'll drive. No. No, no way. He said come alone. You can't take your dirt bike. If he finds out what your knife is or if anything happens to it, you lose access to your Bridge. Okay. Okay. While you're meeting with him, I'll find the car, and I'll get the plate... something concrete that we can take to the police. We can do this. My tiles told me the Brat will find the Wraith. Did they say I'd survive? I'm sure you will. Go home. Sleep. No, I can't sleep. And I definitely cannot go home. When did you graduate high school? Why? Drunk teenagers. Awesome. - Vic! - Oh. Oh, my God, I've been texting you. You're all over my feed. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Something for your troubles? - Oh, Vic doesn't drink, so... Well... Can I have another? Uh, damn, bitch, finish mine. You alkie whore. Who's your friend? I'm Maggie. - Is this Scrabble? - Oh, don't touch that. It contains the mysteries of the universe. Hi. Thought you'd never make it out. Yeah, I have to placate my fans. Yeah, I saw that. Are you okay? I almost drowned in that pool when I was a kid. How old were you? About 8. Yeah, Willa had these, um... these two cousins visiting for the summer. And they were older. Teenage boys. Willa and I were playing with our Barbies one afternoon and they just grabbed me and threw me in. Held me underwater by my ankles and wrists until I thought my lungs would explode. I just felt like I was between worlds or something. Life and death. Reality and thought. Now, there are some people in the world... whose imaginations are so powerful that they can pull their private World of Thought into the physical World of Reality by tearing the fabric between the two. I'm one of those people. You know, scientists say time and space is infinite. There are billions of me's and billions of you's, billions of dimensions. Whatever we can think of, whatever we can dream, has already happened or is happening right now somewhere else. So... So you believe me. Yeah. I believe you. That was my first kiss. You are my first kiss. Well, no, um, no. There is that one time with Joey Ricci, but, uh, I was 5 so that probably doesn't really count. Well, did I... did I live up to or fail the expectations set out by young Joey Ricci? You lived up to. Definitely. Well, let's go for surpass. Come on. Hi, Maggie. Bye, Maggie. Edible? I'm sober. But you can tell me about Michael Jackson over there. Drew Butler. Hasn't stopped talking about Vic since Labor Day. It's so nice to see her having fun. Her parents suck. Then again, all parents suck, especially mine. Aww. They've given you this house, the nice clothes, and... an education. That's, like, their job. - Yeah. Okay. - Don't tell me... you love your parents. I'm an orphan. How old were you, when your parents died? Oh, they're not dead. They disowned me because I'm unholy. Watch this. Who is the coolest girl at Exeter Academy? Check the circuit breaker. Be back with drinks. Beans. That mean anything to you? Um... My mother called me that when I was a baby. That's a pretty cute nickname from someone who sucks. How do you know Vic? I'm her ride. Oh, hey. - Hi! - Hi, it's late. You are so drunk. And we have a date with Charlie Manx in eight hours. - Damn it. - We have to go. I know, I know. Let's go. Man, this place is awesome. Take these and drink this. You'll thank me in the morning. You're awesome. Get some sleep, Brat. Waiting is the worst. I trashed my dad's girlfriend's garage. It was after Sharon... after using my Bridge. I was painting, and... But I scared him. The first time my mom caught me using my Scrabble Bag, she sent me to see our pastor. They thought something was wrong with me. That I was bad. Yeah, my dad used to think I was the greatest when everyone else thought I was a weirdo. And he would always take my side and make me feel like... like I belonged. No matter what, I belonged with him. But, um... I don't know. I don't think I'll ever belong anywhere ever again. Your Bridge brought you to me. So maybe people like us belong with each other. It might not matter after tomorrow. There's only one of him. Two of us. You're younger than I thought. You're almost a child. What have you done with Haley? Rushing to the end before we've finished the beginning? Patience, Miss McQueen, you and I have a great deal to discuss. Please... ...sit with me. The first time you used your Bridge, I could feel it... an arrhythmia. Static came over the radio. I knew you must be extraordinarily gifted to be able to disrupt my Wraith. Then came the dreams. I never had the pleasure of seeing your face, but I did dream other things I knew were related to you. A river. A man's watch. The bats. You'll want to be careful of those bats. Our Inscapes are manifestations of our minds, so if all the bats fly out of your Bridge... Well, you understand the metaphor. What does your Inscape say about your mind? You tell me. It has something to do with Christmas. So you've been dreaming of me, as well. I've had nightmares. You used your Bridge to find Sharon Smith. And I'll use it to find Haley. Well, that's not true. You'd have done it already. Your body's already paying a price for using your Shorter Way. Most Strong Creatives are crippled before they ever reach their full potential. But I am going to live forever because I figured out how to refill what my Inscape takes from me. I could teach you. Like you taught Bing? Mr. Partridge is a... simple man. But, my dear, we are one in a trillion. We? Look at those... commuters. Stacked against one another, you'd be hard-pressed to find any differences between them. Creative people do not belong among them. I doubt you belong anywhere. A feeling I'm sure you know well. Christmasland is my life's work. It is a place of wonder and joy. Your friend Haley is there, safe and sound, with all my other children. I've given them everything... except a mother. You would be very welcome in Christmasland, Vic McQueen. Dare I say, you belong there with me. I'd rather go swimming at Amity Island. It means I'd rather die. That is an option. If you refuse my generosity and cannot be prevailed upon to behave yourself, I will be forced to take measures. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take my Bridge to your Inscape, I'm gonna rescue Haley, and then I'm gonna burn Christmasland to the ground with you in it. You are gifted, my joy, and have great faith in your Bridge, but no one has ever been able to enter Christmasland except via my Wraith. I told you to come alone. I did, asshole. Who is Margaret Leigh? Vic! Vic! Aah! Hey! Hey, Maggie! Look at me! Hey, hey, wake up! Hey, Maggie! Maggie, hey. Hey, wake up, wake up. Hey, look at me. Hmm? I'm sorry to bother you, Victoria. Do you mind if we go somewhere and talk? I'm not going anywhere. Especially not to talk with you. I just have a few questions. Yeah, well, I answered your questions before. You let Sharon's murderer go free. Yeah, well, I didn't have enough evidence to hold him. What you told me wasn't enough. - Was Bing your boyfriend, Vic? - What? Were you with him when he abducted Sharon? - No. - Then why leave out so many details? Were you scared he was gonna hurt you? Is that why you were at the bus station, - trying to leave town? - Oh, my God. Who was driving the car that hit Ms. Leigh? Was it Bing? Did you see him? You must have seen the driver. We are never going to find out who did this to your friend, we'll never find Haley, and more people will get hurt unless you tell me what you know. Who was driving the car? No one. It's a black 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with a vanity license plate NOS4A2, and I watched it run down Maggie on its own. You're saying the car hit Maggie with no driver behind the wheel? The Wraith belongs to Charlie Manx. He uses it to hurt people. He uses it to steal kids and take them to a dark place in his imagination called Christmasland where he hurts them, too. There's a bridge called the Shorter Way that I can build in my mind. It helps me find lost things. I thought I could help you find those children. They want me to sign something called - a conditional voluntary commitment. - I know. I'm not crazy. I know you're not. It's just, you know, a few days. Just to get some rest, Vic. It's to get a little help, Brat. I wish that I'd gotten some help when I needed it. I don't need help. I don't... This is a good thing. What, good for me, or good for you and Tiffany? I guess good for everyone. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com
