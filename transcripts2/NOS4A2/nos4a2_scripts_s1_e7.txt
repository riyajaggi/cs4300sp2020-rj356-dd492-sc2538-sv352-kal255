 Seasons greetings from Christmasland. Hi, Maggot. I-I'm coming to get you. I don't want to leave. I have a lot of friends here. We're wondering if you've seen Father Christmas. Haley, that man who took you is not Father Christmas. He is a very bad man. You stay away from him, okay? A ride in the Wraith is the best thing to ever happen to little Haley. If you were truly her friend, you'd be happy for her. Who is this? Where is Father? Listen, kid, I don't know what he's done to you, but that man is not Father Christmas. He was looking for you and your Bridge,

 and he hasn't come back. Where is he? I don't know, but I do know he's hurt... Liar! No one can hurt him. I can. You cannot! And you will not. But he will find you, Vic McQueen. He will find you and bring you to us, and then we can play Scissors for the Drifter. It will be so fun. Hello? Hello? Vicki, what are you doing? Honey, please, take your pills. Go back to bed. Howdy. Need some help? Howdy. Vicki, I made eggs. Ta-da! Uh, thanks, Mom, this looks amazing, but I'm kind of in a rush. No, sit. School doesn't start for an hour. But I got to get my bike back from Dad before I go. I sold it. What? I sold that dirt bike. W-While I was in the hospital? How you feeling, huh? You must've been sleepwalking - or dreaming or some... - It wasn't yours. You were driving it illegally and it wasn't good for you. Dad gave it to me. Years ago, without asking me. Okay, who did you sell it to? Uh... someone on the Internet. That Greg's place or whatever. Alright, get it back. It's gone, Vicki. You had no right. I'm the mother. Yeah, you're something, alright. Ask your tiles where to find my bike. Hello to you, too, sunshine. My mom sold it. Please. - I can't help you. - Just ask the Tiles where it is or... or where I can find a new Knife. Jolene told me Knives can be replaced. I threw my Tiles away. Haley called me from Christmasland. Was Daniel there? I don't know. Haley sounded weird. She sounded different, and there... there was a girl with her, another one of his victims. They... I know you're scared, Maggie, but we don't have a choice. Oh, I'm not scared, Vic. - I'm done. - Maggie, we... All my life, no matter what happened, I knew I could take care of myself. I was smart. I was strong. I felt safe 'cause I could protect myself. That feeling is gone. Okay, but no one can keep these kids safe from Charlie Manx but me. I need my Knife. Well, I hope you find it. Your friend Haley is there, safe and sound, with all my other children. Strong Creatives can pull their Inscapes into the Real World with the help of a Knife. - That chair found me... - Stop. ...got me moving again. Shut up. The girl who finds lost things can find lost children. Shut up. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. Damn. Oh, God. Hey, Brat. Mom sold my bike. Yeah, I'm sorry. I tried to, uh, talk her out of it, but hard to argue with you in the hospital, you know? I thought you would've visited me. I had work. But I'll make it up to you. I want to go to Bike Week. Wait, no. I thought we were gonna go. Please, Dad, we always go. Uh, okay. You, me, and Tiff'll go together. Okay. Bye. Sorry about your water pump. You let us know if there's anything else we can do to help. You're old. Hey, we talked about this, sport. What's the Scout law? Uh, a Scout is kind? And courteous. Apologize to Mr. Manx. No need to apologize for the truth, Bradley. In fact, I think truthful boys should be rewarded. Sorry, sport. Too much sugar already today. Don't want to ruin your teeth. Morning, sir. Fine weather, ain't it? What can I do ya for? 10 bottles of engine coolant, and would you be so kind as to lend me your telephone machine? Landline? Of course. You know, you look like a fella comes in here sometimes. Folks around here call him, uh, Father Christmas. Uh, you his grandpa? Yes. Well, tell him hello from Sam. I need you to fly to Colorado. Col-or-a-do. Today. Now. Write down this address. Well, get a pen, Bing. I saved this for you, Bradley. Your cruel father isn't watching. My father's kind. Really? Is it kind to deny candy to a child? There's no need to worry about your teeth, Bradley. I know of a place where you can get a shiny new set. You look like you've seen a ghost. Did you know your boss ran my friend over with his car? Her name is Maggie Leigh. She's a librarian, Bing. She... She must've been causing trouble. No. No, Charlie Manx is the one who's causing trouble. Where is he? I-I don't know. This is Peter Ives. He worked for Manx right before you. - Should get out of my... - He's dead, Bing. Police blamed a bunch of kidnappings on him. They found him dead, same as everyone else who's ever worked for Manx. Charlie Manx has a house in the real world. I saw it. Tell me where it is, Bing. Tell the police, okay, before he kills you, too, as well... Tell your lies. Mess with my head. But know that you could end up dead. Oh, there she is. I'll see you later. Hey. How'd it go? Any progress? Yeah, from dull throb to searing, unbearable burn. Taking anything for it? No. Well, your stutter stopped. I threw my Scrabble Tiles away. Really? Hey, I mean, you loved that Scrabble bag. I thought you'd be happy. Hey, I-I think you should stay with me till you get better. No. - My fish would get lonely. - Well, bring the damn fish, then. Joe, I'm fine. Look, I just know your history, and I don't want you to fall back into any bad habits. Finished the pills they gave me. I tried to get some more, but they wouldn't refill the scrip. - You don't believe me, you can check my bag. - Okay. Okay, so no more Scrabble Tile goose chases? - Nope. - And no more tracking down cold-blooded killers on your own? Not a chance. Good, 'cause... I had a foot in the grave worrying about you. Oh, you had a foot in the grave 'cause you're old as sin. Come on. By the time we arrive at the scrap yard, I may be too weak to communicate with the proprietress. It is imperative that she sell you a new water pump and that you install it immediately. My life will depend on it. Please acknowledge me. Nod your head to show you understand. Nobody likes a sulk, Bing. What's on your mind? What happened to Peter Ives? Did you kill him? Are you gonna kill me? Is that what you think? I-I just want to go to Christmasland. That is exactly where you will go once our work is complete. I took Peter Ives and the others to Christmasland, right up to the gate. Sadly, they were unable to enter because they proved to be naughty, not nice. Naughty boys can't go to Christmasland. As long as you remain on my nice list, you have nothing to fear. Now, please, time is of the essence. Uh, but I wonder, where are all these questions coming from? I saw Vic at school today. Vic McQueen. Of course. But you're too smart to let a meddlesome female shake your faith, Bing Partridge. You really think I'm smart? Oh, yes. Very smart. And nice. I'm gonna buy that for you. Hmm? You know, for your dorm at RISD. Are you knocking the Bob Ross school of landscape painting? Never. I'm merely planning a gift. Well, good, because my grandmother and I lived for his happy trees, thank you very much. She teach you to paint? Yeah, her, Bob Ross, comic collection, I guess. Simpler times. Were they? You know, nostalgia's a funny thing... makes the past seem better, like something it never was. My dad's picking me up in a few minutes. Walk me to the corner? That's right. Bike Week. Stay with me. I need a new bike, and I promised my dad. What's wrong? I don't think you owe him anything. Well, I'm not going because I owe him. He's... my dad. I like him. I think you deserve better. You don't know him. - Only what you've told me. - What, that he couldn't help me - with my financial aid? - That he walked out on you. Well, at least he didn't send me away to boarding school. You know, my parents just want me to have a good education. Just because my father's not a doctor doesn't mean - I don't have a good... - You don't have to be a doctor to show up when your kid's in the hospital. I'm sorry. I don't understand how he could do that. My parents have always been there for me. Yeah, well, good for you and your parents. You know, I think it's probably easier to be there for people when there's money in the bank and food on the table and the heat hasn't been shut off in January. I bet it's a lot freakin' easier to be there for your kids when you get married after college and med school and... and... and... and backpacking abroad instead of after teenage pregnancy and two tours in the Gulf. It's also easier when you're not drunk. I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to say all that. Yes, you did. Where's Tiffany? Just us, Brat. You ready? Always. This is where we found Big Red, 'memba? Yep. Said it was too big for me. Well, it was. But you lit up like a Christmas tree when you rode the damn thing. I had to get it for you. It was fun then, you know? Things were simpler. Hey, you want to, uh, hit the Broken Spoke? No, let's find a bike. Oh, there you are. It's about time you showed up. I told you I had a meeting. Ma'am? Are you the proprietress? Yeah, I need to buy a water pump for a 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith. Yeah, uh, Grandpa's real tired after a long drive. He needs a rest to feel his best. I think I got a Wraith water pump laying around here somewheres. Let me double check the inventory. Meantime, get that contraption off there. Yeah. Hey! Hey. Maggie. A Wraith surfaced in Nebraska. Did you hear what I said? You were right. Our junkyard lady phoned it in. Local uniforms are on their way. They're gonna catch that bastard. What the hell are you doing out here? Huh? Maggie? Maggie. Oh, no. Oh, Mags. No. Hey. Not this shit again, Maggie. Come on. Come on. Let's get you home. Come on. Very high performance, very fast. Well, they don't really make 'em slow, do they? Whattaya think? Yeah, get on. Fire her up. This could be the one. You can go ahead and give her a test ride. Thank you, but it's not what I'm looking for. Brat, that's a great bike. It's even better than your old one. Alright, we been looking at bikes all day. We got to eat to live. Come on, Broken Spoke. Let's go. Let's go, let's go. I don't know what you're looking for, Brat, but that bike is freakin' perfect for you. Good thing you ordered two. You sound like Linda. What? You know how the service is here. It's slower than a three-legged dog chasing his tail in a snowstorm. Look. I'm with you. Alright? It was lousy of Linda to sell your bike, and it was lousy that I didn't stop her, alright? Guess I've been screwin' up pretty good in the dad department lately, huh? - I'm sorry. - You already apologized. Guess I'm apologizing again. I'm so proud of you. And when you wanted to move in with me... I'm sorry that it didn't work out. Hey, oh, you want, like, a frappe or something when the girl... Excuse me. You know what? I'll take a beer. I'll take two. You know how the service is here. Hello? Come visit us in Christmasland, Vic McQueen. Take your Bridge and bring us something to eat. Who the hell is this? Is Haley with you? If you so much as touch a hair on her head, - so help me God... - Haley is my friend, you dumb cow. She's right here with me. Come to Christmasland. Father hasn't been here in ages. We are waiting for you, and we are hungry. Cat got your tongue? Poor old Vic McQueen... her father a drunk, her mother a mean. Early motherhood awaits her, with no man to wed her. Unless she can find it within to give thanks to her new friend and savior, Millie Manx. Look what the wind blew in. How was the nuthouse, nutbird? Yeah, real nice. You'd have fit right in. Hey, I got... I got you a... a souvenir. It's a... It's a commemorative pin. Shit. Why'd you get me Big Red at Bike Week when I was a kid? I told you. It was because I lit up like a Christmas tree when I saw it? Yeah. That's a lie. You'd just had a huge, drunken fight with Ma. Beer. Vodka. Screaming. Bruises. You didn't think I heard you, but we live in a box, Dad. Of course I freakin' heard you. Even though we all denied it, you and I both knew I heard it all. You knew I knew, so you bought the bike as an apology to make up for your shit with Mom. The bike didn't make up for anything, Dad, and your shit-faced apology today doesn't make up for abandoning me or not visiting me in the hospital or any of the other billions of ways you have chosen booze over me. Only a child would think it does. Right. And what... What... What... Drinking these beers and making a big scene like this, that makes you what? That makes you sophisticated or something? - Makes you an adult? - It's not my job to be the adult. It's not my job. I hope that you never have to feel what it's like to disappoint people that you love. You keep drinking like your old man here, I guarantee you will find out. Hey, Vic? Hey, hey. You alright? My father is a drunk, and my mother sold my bike. I can't access my Bridge without my bike. - Without my Bridge, I can't ever save Haley. - Hey, hey, slow down, - slow down, slow down, slow down. - And I thought I could find another bike here, another Knife with my father, but my father is freakin' useless! He has been all along! Hey, I don't care about him. I don't care about him. Alright? I don't care about your Bridge or Haley. Are you alright? Are you alright? You got me a souvenir? Yeah. Um... It's a... it's a commemorative pin. Let me see. I know it's, uh... I know it's corny. I love it. Can you take me home? Yeah. Come on. Nearly there, Mr. Manx. Bing, hurry! That's right, you son of a bitch. I remember you. I know in my bones you took my son and my grandson. You're gonna die here or in jail, you little ratface. Okay, I got it. Fill it. Mr. Manx. Promise me you won't murder me like Peter Ives. Promise me you'll take me with you to Christmasland. Dear boy, I cannot take you anywhere if we are in prison. Start the car. You feign concern over your son and grandson, but I know the truth, Judith Miller. Where there should've been the warmth of a mother's love, young Robert was met only with sour chewing tobacco and motor grease. Robert Jr. is very happy in Christmasland, Judith, but Robert Sr., he took after you. He was a terrible parent. Leave the old bitch to die as she lived... all alone and surrounded by refuse. Let's away, Mr. Partridge. They're gonna get us. Patience, Bing. They... They... They don't see us. - Ma'am? - Mrs. Miller? They don't notice us. Hey, Ma. Vic's here. Just come on back. Hey, Tiff. Tiffany. When did I give you this, third grade? Second. When's the last time you slept? When they sedated me in the hospital. Feels like a thousand years ago. Ready? Yeah. Alright. Hey, you alright? You're good, you're good. I know times have been tough. You're staying here till you're better. I believe in you! Joe? I'm sorry I'm such an ass. You don't have to do all this.

You're right to be concerned after the shenanigans you pulled at that old bat's scrap yard. I'm so... I'm... I'm really sorry. You allowed Vic McQueen to poison your mind. She's a dangerous one.
