 This is where he lived before it burned down. My sister says he used to roast kids alive in that old stove. Bullshit. He didn't eat them. You scared? He's in jail. He's in a coma, but he could still kill you 'cause he's magic. Bite the smallest! Eat him up! Come get me! Bite the smallest! Drink his blood! Bite the smallest! Eat him up! Bite the smallest! Drink his blood! Bite the smallest! Eat him up! Bite the smallest! Drink his blood! Bite the smallest! Eat him up!

 Millie? What's happening? My sister says he tricked kids with candy canes and presents. Shh! Tricked them into his creepy car, brought them here. They say hundreds of kids could be buried out here, maybe thousands. No one knows how long he kept them here... - Who are they? - Or what he did to them. Are they from the other world? They look fun. You. Come here. We're gonna play a new game. Ugh! - Aaaah! - Aaaah! What is it, Millie?

Well you and I both know the ugly truth, Carmody. I ain't here for you. Oh, no? No. I'm here for your comic collection. Oh, man. Guys, cut it out. Okay. Let's see what ya got. Wayne, tell your mom she's awesome. - Stop being weird. - Yeah. I'm gonna beat her at "2k." Well, I gotta finish this tank, kiddo. Talk to your dad. He's too old. No hustle. Oh, excuse me?

He's on the TV. Serial killer died today in his prison hospital bed after spending the last eight years in a deep coma. Charlie Manx was... Aaaaah! Hey. Hey. This is good news, Vic. Great news. Look, I'm... I'm sorry. Did that that cause visions? No, I'm fine. I... Just... Okay. Let's go... movies. Always helps you forget. We can start putting him behind us. Huh?

I can count on one hand the number of times she's called since she left town, and every time she does, it's... trouble. She must've heard about Manx's death. Like I said. Well, well. Look who finally figured out how to work a phone. They're saying Charlie Manx is dead. I know. Will you ask your Tiles? I don't do that anymore. Maggie, please. Vic, he's dead. Did your Tiles say that? The FBI did, and they got it from a very reliable snitch... The Denver medical examiner. Well, they're wrong. I'm the one who's supposed to kill him. Your Tiles said so, Maggie. They never lie. My Tiles said you'd find him. And you did... Eight years ago. I didn't finish the job. You don't even have a knife. Well, then, ask your Tiles how to find a new one. We've asked them before. What would make today any different? Because Charlie Manx isn't dead. Vic, let it go. This is your happy ending, so try to see it. Go make an honest man out of that snuggly bear of yours and get your ass online so I can see pictures of Wayne before he hits the gangly phase. You don't even have a knife. Jolene told me knives can be replaced. Cuts the fabric between the Real World and the World of Thought. Come on, you son of a bitch! Hey, Bats. Sam called. He has a bike for Dad, but you took the truck, so... A bike? Did he say what kind? No. Tell your dad I'll pick it up. 'Kay. Okay. Love you. I love you, too. Bye. That was fast. Where's the bike? Well, I was clearing some junk out of storage, and there it was. I called Lou right away. Funny you were in the area. You know, Steve McQueen had one just like it. Oh. Look at this. Show me. Oh, it's in the loading bay. Go ahead.

Uh, studio's private. Well, I-I'm, uh, I'm Ethan Anderson, a Rolls-Royce enthusiast. Oh, right. You replied to my online post. The preview'll be at the cafe after the show's installed. You can discuss sales with a gallery assistant there. Ah, you took the engine out. Yeah, th... This one you're eyeing, uh, was actually owned by a ruthless serial killer. I got it at a police auction a few months ago, restored it for the show. Now it'll return to the earth and be forgotten like all of capitalism's false, murderous idols. You replied to my post that this Rolls-Royce Wraith was for sale. Yeah, it will be, next week, at the gallery, uh, for like $150,000. That's a lot of money. Well, there are smaller pieces available. No. No, I want this Wraith. You see, I'm a Rolls-Royce enthusiast. Dad. Dad. Mom says I have to stay at her place tomorrow night, but I don't want to 'cause I hate Eric. Well, he's your step-brother. It's his birthday. Try and be friends? I don't like sleepovers, either. Friends can be mean. Sometimes they won't play with you. Sometimes they hit you. Sometimes they even hit you in the privates. All right. Eric does that. Yeah. Well, I-I had a friend once. Name's Vic McQueen. She told lies about me, tattled. I hate her. Uh, Mr., um... Anderson, was it? Uh. I appreciate your interest. Uh, I'm pretty busy. Yeah. You sure you don't want to give me that Wraith? Well, you have a nice day. It was a pleasure to meet you. It's my knife, Lou. I can frickin' feel it. I'll, uh I'll finally be able to open the Shorter Way. - The Shorter Way. Cool. - Uh-huh. Wait, that magical bridge that gives you the ability to go anywhere? Well, you know, to... To find lost things, yeah. And, uh look, I know this might sound crazy, but this... This Triumph... I think I conjured it. Mm. Dude, I have no doubt. We've already established that you're a superhero. It'll be our Millennium Falcon. Well, we got to get it runnin', so... We'll be like Han and Leia. Oh! Rey and Finn. I'm gonna use it to find Charlie Manx. He's... he's dead, Vic. Have you been drinking? Okay, this... this isn't like Christmas, all right? It's... It's... Good, because every Christmas, you nearly drink yourself to death, and you start hearing phones, voices. Wayne and I need you around. I have a knife now, all right? I'm gonna find him, Lou. I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna kill him once and for all. Vic. Vic, listen to me. Doctors, coroners, cops, reporters... They all say he's dead. This thing that's been hanging over us... it's gone. We're free of him now. We can finally start thinking about making things legal with us, with Wayne. I mean if that's if that's something you would want. Of course it is. I. I don't want you to die an old maid. Let's celebrate. I'll call in sick. Uh, no, sir. We need your paycheck. Go. I'll get this running. Han and Leia, huh? And I'll pick up Wayne, too. Team Carqueen. Huh? We need a team name. Team McCarmody? Team Carqueemody. Yeah, you know, keep thinking about it. - It's the last one. - Is it? - It's the last one. - Mm-hmm. Hi. Um... I'd like to report an emergency at Haverhill Public Library. Yeah, uh, the lights went all fritzy, and s-something happened to one of the librarians... The really cute, fun one with purple hair. Yeah. She's i-in the basement, so... please hurry. Is the Wraith dead? ♪ Sometimes there's no one listening ♪ ♪ Sometimes there's nothing... ♪ ♪ Away in a manger no crib for a bed ♪ ♪ The... ♪ Vic? Where were you? You were supposed to pick up Wayne from school. Oh, my God. Bats... I'm so sorry. I lost track of time, and I, uh... The other moms were there. I, uh... I messed up. Big time. Are you coming to my game Saturday? I'll be there, okay? You want to talk about it? I just lost track of time. Working on your supernatural bike that helps you find stuff. Sorry. I don't know what it is you're trying to find, babe. I guess I hoped that Wayne and I would be enough. Lou... Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, for yesterday. You and Wayne are enough. You're more than I deserve. Come on. You deserve... so much more than this. I keep waiting for you to wake up and realize your terrible mistake... Shacking up with a dumb-ass like me. You know, I've made a lot of terrible mistakes in my life, and shacking up with you is just not one of them. Wow. I think, uh... I think that's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me. Team McCarmody forever. Mm. You didn't like Team Carqueemody? Meh. Oh. Telemarketer. Probably trying to sell us some solar panels. One day I'll get us a few. You get ready for work. I'll do school. All right. Where's Dad? Work. I'm gonna be late for school. We're playing hooky today, mister. Today's my day to feed the class gerbil. I think Ms. Lewis will let you swap days with another kid. I'll write you a note. Ready for breakfast? ♪ Aaah ♪ Breakfast of champions! Wayne! Keeping it all for yourself. Oh-ho-ho-ho! Swish. Swish! All right. I'll show you swish. Denied! Oh, take it easy on me, kiddo. You're pretty tough competition. Dad says that thing reminds him of a sewing machine. Yeah, well, Dad's a Harley guy. Yep. But he is also a good person who loves us very much, so we are gonna overlook this obvious flaw in his character. Who was that guy on the TV? Charlie Manx? I saw your face. Yeesh. Nothing gets by you. You know, there are a lot of bad people in the world, right? Mm-hmm. And Charlie Manx is one of them. He'd take kids, he'd promise them candy and... and toys, and then he'd take them away from their parents forever. And that is why I told you you should never go anywhere with anyone who doesn't know the password. 10:48 Fairbanks. Code to the Batcave. That's right. Did Charlie Manx take you? He, uh... He took someone I loved. Was it my dad? Dad's your dad, you know? The ancient guy with no hustle. I know. But I mean my other dad, my biological dad, the one who died. Craig. His name was Craig. Craig. Mm-hmm. Did Charlie Manx kill him? He died in Manx's car. But I promise, I will never, ever let anything like that happen to you. 'Cause Charlie Manx is dead. Wayne, do you hear the phone ringing? What phone? Mom? What are you doing? Stop! You're gonna break it! Oh. Wayne, I'm coming... I'm coming in. Wayne. 10:48 Fairbanks. Open up. Come on! Open the door right now! Stop it! You're scaring me! Mom! Stop calling here. What are you doing to Christmasland, bitch? You wanna harass me, that's fine. But stop calling this house. You leave my family alone. You leave Christmasland alone, or my father will stick a fork in your eyes and pop 'em out like corks. Let him try. I'll light him on fire like I did at Sam's Gas. You be quiet, Vic McQueen. You're a liar and a pest. You tell Father Christmas I'm coming for him, and never call here again, or I'll light you up, too. - Did Charlie Manx kill him? - He's dead, Vic. Doctors, coroners, cops, reporters... They all say he's dead, all say he's dead. Mom. Oh, my baby. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. For what? What exactly... are you apologizing for, Vic? You apologizing for not talking to me about what's been going on with you since that damn news report? Or for telling me you're fine when you're not? Or for feeding me one-liners instead of telling me that you love me or you hate me or anything real about whatever the h-hell you're feeling? For always having one foot out the door? I don't. Team McCarmody. Ah, that's bullshit. I know it. So does Wayne. We're used to it... Used to the drinking and the hiding and the deflecting. Lou, this is... But tonight, Vic... Tonight, you got drunk in front of Wayne, and then started a fire in our house. That's crazy. Charlie Manx... He's dead! I know! I know. I just had to see it for myself. Why did you need to believe that he was alive so badly? You know, Maggie said a long time ago that every gift comes with a cost, and I think that just using my Bridge a lot when I was younger and fighting Charlie Manx and Craig... It has taken me apart in ways that I don't understand, and don't think I can be p put back together. That's not true. You need help, Vic. Like... professional help. We can't afford it. We'll sell the bikes. No. You love your bikes. Dude, I love you so much more than I love that stupid bike. Ah. Like, it's... It's not even a contest. You also need to stop drinking. Come here. We'll figure this all out in the morning, okay? God damn you for smelling so good, Carmody. You're leaving, aren't you? You're safer with Dad. Is it because of Charlie Manx? No, Bats. It's because of me. Don't forget your jacket. Dad says it's got armor, to protect you. You be good. I love you. Stop it! You're scaring me! Open the door right now! You're leaving, aren't you? You know, I tried to play nice. I told you I was an enthusiast, but you dumb as a box of hair. Well, help me get this engine in. Let's do this. And slowly, slowly, slowly. Yes, sir. Yeah, stop. The lights are on!
