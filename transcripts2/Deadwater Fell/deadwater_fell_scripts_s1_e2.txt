 {\an5}Last night something sad happened. Charlotte and Iris and Emily may not be with us but they're all together with their mummy now. Was it depression? Or anxiety? A combination. Come on. Don't be a prick, Kate! Come on. Come on, kids. I mean, it's Tom that matters. He fricking adores you. Is that right? I don't want to. Just give it to her! Give it to her...

 {\an1}TYRES SCREECH Kate! They're not answering! See here? They've all been injected with something. Look at this. Pine needles in Emily's pyjamas, in her feet. What did she do? YEAH! We met on a bus. Er, number 19. Pissing down with rain, I was in a shitty mood, and there she was. Top deck, left-hand side.

 I saw her there every morning for... ..it must've been weeks, before I talked to her. Sorry, er... Am I...? Is this going back too far, or is this...? You can tell us whatever you like. Whatever you think's relevant. I asked her out. We went to some real divey bar. You know sometimes when you're with someone and you have to work at it and it's awkward and you run out of things to say? We never ran out of things to say. It was easy with Kate. Tell us about the girls. They were beautiful. {\an1}HE BREATHES DEEPLY {\an1}HE SNIFFS She loved them. Please don't think she didn't. She had issues, after Charlotte was born? I got her help. Counselling and anti-depressants. My mum moved in for a bit, so... ..as Charlotte got older, Kate got better. She was... Could you tell us about the car crash? She was only just over the limit. Yeah, but the thought of going to court must've been weighing heavy. She knew it was only a fine. And a one-year ban. Yeah. It wasn't great, but it wasn't... Even on the day, she was good, wasn't she? You wouldn't have known. We do bath time together, normally. Um, then read a story, or whatever. But it was late, so Kate said we'd skip the bath and she'd put them to bed. So how long before you went upstairs? Ten minutes, maybe fifteen? I unloaded the dishwasher, locked up, switched out the lights... We can stop whenever you want, Tom. No, no. She'd closed their eyes. Tucked them up with their teddies and everything. {\an1}HE SOBS They were already dead. Did she say anything to you? And there was nothing that sparked it? An argument? I've been going over and over it, I...but... ..there's nothing. There's just... There's nothing. You know, if you want to see the girls, we can arrange that. No, I don't think I... Ruth, it's fine. You stay there. Stay there. Has he said why? No, I don't... I don't think he knows. Sorry. {\an1}WATER RUNS Did she say anything... ..at the end, Tom? I have to look my best for her, don't I? Yeah. According to the multitudes of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin, for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me. In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our frail bodies that they may be conformed to His glorious body who died, was buried and rose again for us. To Him be glory forever. Amen. {\an1}SHE SOBS {\an1}SOBBING CONTINUES Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Thank you. I'm just gonna talk to this lady. Aye. Hi. You OK? Not really. I'm, um, I'm Jess, one of Kate's friends. I'm Sasha. Sasha. From teacher training? Er, yeah, that's right. Yeah, she talked about you. Did she? Yeah, she'd have been glad you came. Thanks. Listen, did you, um...? Did you see she had it in her, to do something like this? No. Did you? {\an3}SOBBING > HE MURMURS: It's OK. It's all right. I've got you. Puts on a good show, doesn't he? In you come. Come on, now. Here we go. It was nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. {\an1}CHURCH BELL CHIMES {\an1}CHATTER {\an1}Do they always come to funerals? Yeah. It's just protocol. Tom, I'm so sorry. You're such a baby. Elliot. Pack it in. What you meant to do? Oh, Christ. Who's that with Sandra? Fuck knows. She really picks her moments, eh? Come on. I'm not sure it's possible to sum up three lives... Three beautiful, vibrant, smiley little lives. I didn't know how to do it. I didn't know where to start so I... Erm, I wrote a list, sorry. "Oh, dear." Those were Emily's first words. I think probably, erm, because we were trying so desperately not to swear in front of her. And when you have a baby for the first time, it gives you an awful lot to swear about! Iris... ..knew all the words to The Greatest Showman. And, after watching it for the hundredth time, so, unfortunately, did we! If Charlotte ever saw a bee, a sleepy bee, she'd call it. She'd insist that we saved it. And she wasn't satisfied until she saw it fly away. {\an1}SOBBING {\an1}She always had to watch them fly away. Come on. Come on, son. {\an1}INDISTINCT SINGING {\an1}SHOUTING Say hi. Hi. {\an1}GIGGLING {\an1}Go ask dad to film it, he'll take it. OK. Can I film it? Yeah, course you can. Just give me a sec. {\an1}GIRLS CONTINUE PLAYING {\an1}CHATTER Jess. This is, erm, Luke. Hi. All right. {\an1}And err, this is...this is Steve. Hi. All right. Nice service. Aye. Nice. Yeah. It was lovely. Hi, Tom, how are you? Hi. Fine. I'm sorry for your loss. Your drunken behaviour shouldn't waste police time. Apologise to Steve. For what, Dad? I've not done anything. Being a pain in the arse. Sorry, Jess. It's OK. It's the fire. No. Bollocks! He's been like it since birth. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my God, it's unbelievable. I heard she put a lock on their bedroom door. Jesus. God, as a mother, you just can't imagine it. Jess. Cos do you know what, as a non-mother, I can totally imagine it. That's not what I meant. Come on! How old is he? He's 28. In a few months. Why, is Steve pissed off? He'll get over it. Wait till he hears he's moving in. Don't be drinking it. Are you OK? Didn't even get a mention at her own children's funeral. Now they're cutting her out. Like a cancer. {\an1}CHIMING Fucking bastards. Take your bag off. Hi. Er, Jessica Milner. M-I-L-N-E-R. {\an1}KIDS ARGUING Lovely. Please take a seat. Yeah. Thank you. Er, boys. Boys! Quietly. It's a doctors. Don't fight. Don't fight. Get off me! Shh! Jessica? Yeah. Erm, Elliot, I'm not gonna be long, all right? Just watch your brother. My partner's gonna join us. My friend died. {\an1}BEEPING Three going back in today. Watch for the flash. And that is them all in. All right? Yeah. What round is this for you? Er, second. Best of luck. Thank you. Thanks. Have a little lie down for ten minutes. Cup of tea? I'm fine, thanks. She'll have milk, no sugar, thanks. {\an1}DOOR CLOSES {\an1}KNOCK AT DOOR Hey! Shit. I'm so sorry. I was expecting it. We both were. You know, it's just our first time. Oh! Come here. I'm gonna get snot on you! It's OK. Three of them, Steve. I think you just need to focus on all the positive things. Like? Like... ..your carbon footprint. Wow. No kids, no emissions. Really scraping the barrel there! You have full control of your bladder. Not always. A vagina that doesn't look like it's been mauled by a pit-bull. You've got it so good. I don't know what you're moaning about. Cheers. Thanks for that. CAROL: Kate? You know what I mean. The girls are asking for you. Yeah, thank you, Carol. Enjoy it while it lasts. Kate. What are we supposed to do with this? Stick it on the fridge? It's the second time this week, Dylan. Steve-oh! He lost his bike. I lost my bike, Steve-oh! Lost a lot more than that by the looks of it. When did you lose it? Lose what? The bike, Dyl... Jesus! Nice kicks. Can I keep 'em? You know what, mate? You have 'em. My treat. You not getting a bit old for boozing in the forest? Says who? Dylan. Please! Just put the trackies on. I'm doing it. When was the last time you saw her? I saw her... I saw her on that night. What was she like? Was she well-liked at school? Yeah, she was loved. You and Kate, you were close? Yeah. She was my best friend. So you would've talked quite a lot? All the time. What about? Work. The kids. Charlotte? Yeah. Yeah, I was there through all of that. Her cerebral palsy diagnosis. Everything. Did Kate talk about her marriage at all? Just...normal stuff. You know, like she's messy, Tom's tidy. That kind of thing. But nothing big? Not really. They seemed happy? Yeah. Yeah. I can't lift you! LAUGHTER Come on. Do you need help? No. OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! It's all right, it's OK. I love you. I love you, too. No, I mean it. I mean it. Are you gonna be sick? Maybe. Yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. OK. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Look. This is gonna be right here. I don't want to feel like this any more. Oh, dear God. Look at the state of this! Piss off! See what I have to put up with? You're all right, sleep it off. Night, night. {\an1}SOBBING So, on the night of the ceilidh... {\an1}CHILD PANTING {\an1}BIRD SQUAWKS Here you go. Thanks. Look, here's one. Oh, my gosh. Is that her? We were off our faces all the time. Couple of pills, couple of pints. You could do a night out with a tenner. Yeah. That was Kate. What did she say when she talked about me? That you were best mates. You shared a flat, right? Mm. That was the last time I saw her. We fell out. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. About what? Erm. Sorry, no... It's none of my business. Er, no, no. It's fine. Er... I'd split up with my boyfriend. First boyfriend. He was an arsehole but I was heartbroken. Kate was out one night. Tom was there and, er... How are you? I'll be fine. I know but how are you? I'm really fucking depressed. Said I was better than my ex. I was gorgeous. Like he knew everything I needed to hear. It's an entirely one-sided process. All Steve's gotta do is wank into a cup! Biggest problem he's got is aiming straight. For you it's all drugs and scans and... Yeah, it messes with you. Of course it does. I look back and it's so obvious. I should've seen through it. Talk to Steve. How? Exactly like this. Just exactly like we're doing now. Tell him what you're feeling. Tell him what you want. He just... He didn't like us being friends. I keep thinking, if I hadn't let him get in my head... If...if I'd been a better friend... {\an1}BREATHING HEAVILY Easy to look back now, I suppose. Yeah. Sandra tell you about Luke? He's a personal trainer, apparently. Course he is. Wanker. Does she even think about the boys? Even once? Does she not think they've been through a lot recently? I had sex with Tom. I was drunk. And it was just once. Fuck! When? After the first IVF. I was angry. You were angry? Not angry. With who? No, I didn't mean that. No, that's what you said. Sad. I meant sad. I was sad. I know. I was fucking sad, too. I know, I'm sorry. But everyone is saying this is Kate. I know her. She wouldn't do this. And I... It was...it was controlling. The sex, it was controlling. I feel like he manipulated me. And I don't know, I... I haven't told the police but I think I should, shouldn't I? Cos it might be relevant, mightn't it? And... Steve, you have to tell me what to do. We think he did it. We think Tom killed them. So... {\an1}PLATE CLATTERS {\an1}DOOR SLAMS Did you drive? Now, remember I told you this might sting a little bit, Lew, OK? You're so brave. Just a little. It's only gonna sting a little. Just a little bit. OK. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, done. Done, done, done, done, done. Good boy, you're so brave! Now we're just gonna put the jungle plaster on. That wasn't so bad, was it? So brave. Ready? {\an1}PHONE RINGS OK. OK, right. PHONE STOPS RINGING Ready, steady, go. You were so brave, you were so brave. Right, go get cereal. Go. Go find your brother. Tell him he can get some for you, OK? {\an1}RUNNING WATER Did you wait till the embryos went in before you told me? Steve. We had sex on or about the 15th September, 2018. There was a domineering element to the sex, which unnerved me. He pushed my face against the door. There was never any discussion about it afterwards, and it never happened again. I didn't discuss it with my partner or anyone else, although, from some things she said, I felt that Kate may have known. Are you happy with that? Yeah. If you'd just have a quick scan through and sign it for me. Sure. We'll have to let Steve know. I've already told him, so... Rough day, eh? {\an1}RADIO PLAYS {\an1}RADIO STOPS What the fuck I done now? I found your bike. Out near the Kendricks' house. Didn't find my Nikes, did you? Any idea how it got there? Fuck knows! Were you having a party? 80 quid, those Nikes cost. All your little pals on the nox, were they? What night was that? No comment. Look, this isn't an interview. You don't have to say no comment. Here. Was it the night of the fire? Did you see something? I don't wanna get anyone in the shit, Steve-oh. I don't want to feel like this any more! {\an1}SHE SOBS Hello, Jess. Hi. VOICE MESSAGE: Hello, love, it's Carol. Sorry to be a pest. Tom's been struggling to get hold of you. Are you still OK to collect him from Callum and Ruth's? Let me know. Bye. Are you warm enough? I'm fine. Have you told the police... ..about... ..what happened with us that time? Why would I tell them that? Don't you think it might matter? Have you told them? No. Do you want the electric blanket on? Don't fuss, Mum. Carol. Oh, so... I knew a bit of what Kate went through, you know, with Charlotte. Baby blues and... It was different back then, though. No-one really talked about it. Well, we don't know that's what it's about... ..not for sure, do we? I don't know what to say to him. Can I smoke? Er, not in here. Sorry, Dylan. Do you mind if we call you Dylan? It's my name, so.... We'd like to record this, if it's all right with you? Whatever. How far away were you? Eight metres, maybe. And it was dark. Yeah, but there was light from our fire, so... It's, er, it's hot. Thanks. Which one of the girls was it? Did you see? Emily. You're absolutely sure about that? My little cousin's in her class at school. She must've said something... ..at the end, Tom. She was running... ..she fell, and he caught up with her. What do you want, Jess? Who did? Her dad. {\an1}PHONE RINGS Hi. It's him. We have a witness. Jess? Yeah. Where are you? I'm, er... I'm in the car. I'll call you back. You off? Just need to pick the boys up. She loved you so much, you know that? She wasn't in her right mind, at the end, that's all I can think. She wouldn't have done this to us if she was in her right mind. Yeah. Love to the boys. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! {\an1}SIREN BLARES Mummy, no! No. {\an1}SIREN BLARES
