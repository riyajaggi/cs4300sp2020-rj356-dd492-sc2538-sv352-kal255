 Those look amazing. They taste even better! Mm! That is gorgeous. Oh, you can take a couple, if you like. What's this for? We're having a fundraiser. What for? We're getting one of those wooden things, like a gazebo. For the... for the memorial garden. We've got a court date. Eight weeks. Had to happen eventually.

 What about the witness tampering? There is other evidence, Tom. |...| think you need to prepare yourself. But I'm not guilty! I just think you need to get your head around the fact you might be facing a lengthy sentence. I'm not guilty, Nicky. Luke's really good at football, so he did this spin thing so he turns around so the ball's on one foot, then he passes it to the other. No-one can stop him. Eat your muesli, please. Luke likes muesli.

 I don't like it. Eat it. Says it makes you grow muscles. Can I get down now? No. Mm... just this bit, OK? I'm not telling you again! We saw a scan of the baby. You saw a scan? Yeah. It was a girl. Luke wanted it to be a girl. Well, that's lovely. Open your mouth. Lew. Open your mouth. Don't be a baby, Lew. Lew! Steve. Come here. Steve, let him go. Can I get down now? Hey, Lynn. How are you? Fine, thanks. You're looking well. How's Mark? Good, yeah. Good, thanks. I'd better get in. Sure. Are you still living, and intend to stay at the residence previously registered with the police? Yes. Have you adhered to your curfew? Yes. Have you abstained from driving? Yes. Have you stayed away from all witnesses? Yes. You understand you can be arrested without warrant if we have grounds to suspect that you have broken, or are likely to break, any special or standard condition imposed on your bail? I understand, yeah. Sign here. OK. You OK, Lewis? Lewis. Come on. Let's go, come on. Let's go. Lewis saw Tom. What the fuck? That's breaking his bail terms. Did you see him? Well, what was he doing? I don't know. He was just... He was in the memorial garden. Yeah, well, he shouldn't be there. Lew, come on, babe. Was he watching you? Yep, I'm coming, Elliot. Here. So what was he doing? He was just sitting there. Were you even going to tell me? I just did! Lewis, come on! I don't want him near the boys. Like that's in my control. I don't want him near them. What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, Steve? Lew. Lew! Oh, Lew! Lewis. What have you done? Come here. Let me see. Why have you done that? It's all right, mate. It's OK. We're here now. OK? It's all right, mate. I know. He needs to talk to someone. I'll get an appointment with Mark. He needs a counsellor. Not a GP. He's six. He's picking at his skin. If we make a big deal out of it... He's hurting himself. Why didn't Sandra notice? Why didn't we? He just needs to know that everything's going to be all right. And why would he believe that? He misses his friends. So, you're going to make him talk about it? Go back over it? It happened. He won't understand. Look at his arm. He already understands. He just needs to know, Steve, that it's OK to feel sad or angry or scared or... God, poor Lewis. I wish he'd talked to us. Kate told me that, erm, Tom was making her take these... ..these tablets. What tablets? She was scared of him. She asked me for... for help. When? After the accident. Well, what did she say? What did she say, Steve? She said that Tom would kill her one day. I didn't know... She was drunk. I couldn't have known, could I? I can pay for the gazebo. I should pay for it. Do you think, maybe...? Ls it time to start being honest, Tom? I know you have debts, I know there's no money. Come on. Yeah, yeah. If you suck it really hard, your tongue turns pink. Right, £2.50 a book of four? Later, not yet. Oh, they always go down well, don't they? Hi. Hey, Molly, how are you? Ah-ha! Here we go. That's the cakes. Lemon drizzle is it, Mum? Yeah, that's the one. Yeah? Thank you. Pound a pop, very good. She makes very good cupcakes. Can I get you a cup of tea, Carol? Thanks, that would be lovely. All right, Carol? Oh, hi! Oh, hi, mate. Hi. Listen, thank you so much for this. Means an awful lot. Oh, that's fine, yeah. How's business? Good... Good. Anything I need to know about? Well, you know how it is. Nothing really changes. Did you get a locum in? Jennifer. She's lovely. People seem to like her. That's good. Nice to have a catch-up at some point. Of course. Just so I'm on top of everything, you know? Aye. No cars, all right? What if there's a Mini? You've got dozens. Hi, Molly. Here. Steve, leave it. Steve, Steve! Leave it. Steve! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You go near my kids again, I will end you! You understand? You stay away! No, we've got enough. You think you know everything, but you don't. He got a witness to lie! You didn't know that. They were MY family! It's all right, you're all right. Steve! You believe that? Jesus, Steve. Gall of the guy. You do not do that. Fucking gall, coming here. What were you thinking? Are you taking HIS side? Christ... You are. What is wrong with you? Oh, you want to go there, do you? You really want to go there? There is no talking to you. Oh, so it's my fucking fault, is it? I'm not saying that! Well, what are you saying? You know what, Steve? That is exactly what I'm fucking saying! That was your fault! That was you! And Dylan? That was you! And Kate... Kate? Kate was my fault? She asked for your help. I want a restraining order against him. Tom. It's harassment. You shouldn't be near these people. He clearly has some kind of vendetta. You shouldn't be near these people. It shows what sort of guy he is! It shows you breached your bail conditions. Oh, come on, Nicky. For once, take my advice. Let it slide. You want to garner some sympathy, I get it. That's not what I'm trying to do. Position yourself as a victim. That's not what I'm trying to do. All I'm saying is juries aren't stupid. You're being obtuse if you think they won't see right through you. You're fired. Take ca re. I don't know. I just... I don't know how to talk to Lew about his arm. Just be honest. That's all we can be. He's so little... to be doing that. Breaks my heart. He just hasn't... learnt how to talk about things. And where does he get that from? Listen, do you fancy getting out of here? I could murder a glass of wine. Erm... We've, err... we've actually wanted to have a word. OK. I just think we should have the kids for a while. Just for a while. Until Steve, you know... Till he sorts himself out. You know? He's all over the shop, Jess. Yeah, that's understandable, don't you think? Yeah, but... Yeah, he's been through a lot. So has everyone. So's Tom. I mean... What?! It's not cut and dried, is it? What do you mean? I mean, Tom has always seemed like such a lovely man. So?! And if Kate was scared, why didn't she just leave him? That's what I don't understand. Jesus, Sandra. I mean, she had money, she had a job... You never know what goes on behind closed doors, eh? What? Jess? Jess. Go away, Tom. Steve will come back any time. Just two minutes. It's about Kate. Jess, I just need to tell someone... ..about what happened at the end. If you do anything... I'm not going to do anything. I was a good husband. I was a good father. I keep... trying to... ..pin it down. It slips away. That house was so full of life, wasn't it? I wonder whether it's... Oh, I don't know. When Charlotte was born, she was so poorly. I mean, that was hard for me, but Kate... I remember lying with her and she was crying her heart out and just holding her, and I just thought, "If I just worked harder and keep going..." Yeah... That pressure was... What did you need to tell me, Tom? I should've died, too. You can't see pain. You know? People can be in agony, you'll look at their MRI or their X-ray and... "just... People walk around with so much pain, no-one sees it. What pain? My dad, he would... ..hurt me... ..for nothing, just... I broke a plate once, and he made me pick up the pieces and then he... ..stood on my arm until the bone snapped. Mum was there, she didn't do anything. If... if Kate was hurting those girls, I was upstairs. They found me upstairs! So, all I can think is, maybe... ..| saw what she'd done to them and... Cos if I'd seen... I couldn't have watched... ..my girls suffer. That's all I can think. Just needed to tell someone. "Hi, this is Steve. Leave a message after the beep." Hey, it's me. Where are you? Call me, OK? Just let me know where you are. You're scaring me now. Please, Steve. Please call me. I've been looking for you everywhere. I'm fine. For Christ's sake! Come on. All right, I'm fine. Fine. Yeah... Oh, my God. Right, that's it. Get in the fucking car. Get in the car! I let them down. I let them down, didn't I? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We all did. We all let them down. I'm so sorry. It's OK, I'm here. I'm sorry. Sometimes, I see the girls... ..out the corner of my eye. Their skin's burning. They want my help. They were dead, Steve. They were already dead. Yeah, but if... if I'd been a minute earlier... You have to stop. We have to stop. Why did you sleep with him? I was lonely. I was here. I never know what you're thinking. I don't even... What? Do you want to have another kid? Yeah, you want one, so... ii? I just want you to be happy. It has to be both of us. Sometimes, you don't seem happy. I moved here for you. I fell in love with you... Sometimes, I just... I feel like a baby-sitter. Please don't think that. Yeah, I'm just someone to ferry your kids around. The boys love you! Yeah, and I love them! So much. But what about you and me? I know I've not been good enough. But I'll be better. I will. We can do the IVF again, if you want. It's not about that. I'm tired of feeling like a failure. You're not a failure. I want to stop. OK. We have to be better. We will. We will. Come here. Thank you. Hello, there, hi. Hiya. Err, my mum has got a bit frail recently. I wanted to be able to collect her pension for her. I just wondered, is there a form or a...? Yes, mm-hm, I'll get one for you. There you go, all right? That's great, cheers. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Yes, please? Hiya. Hi, how are you? I'm fine thanks, love. Ls Tom here? Not right now. Ls it OK if I come in? Can |...can I get you anything? A cup of tea or...? Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine. Oh, do you want to...? Yeah. I didn't know you were selling. It's getting a bit much for me now. Did they get enough money for the gazebo? Yeah! Yeah, they got more than enough. Oh, that's good! They're, erm... They're putting it up next week. You should come. I think about Kate and the girls all the time. Me too. I'm not sure I have the right, but... That's... That's not true. Why do you think it happened, Carol? Do you think there were reasons? What reasons? Tom's dad. Michael? He said he was violent. Stood on his arm till it broke. Michael was the kindest man. He said you saw it happen. Why would he say that? Why would he lie? Does he frighten you? I can manage him. You... you shouldn't have to manage him. You don't stop loving someone, do you? Even when you know they've done a terrible thing. You have to tell the police what you know. It's all right. It's all right. Did you think I'd feel sorry for you? Ls that why you lied? Kate was ill. Keep saying that. She put a lock on their door. You keep saying that until it sounds like the truth. She locked the girls in their room, Jess. She was scared of you. She locked my girls in! You didn't give a shit about your girls. I was a good father. Christ, just admit it! I was a good husband! You didn't bury her with her babies! I gave my family a beautiful life! You gave them nothing! You..fucking... bastard, you! Fuck you! Mum, call the police. There's not even a reason, is there? You're... you're so banal. You're so fucking banal. Call the police, now. Call the fucking police! Carol? It's just through here. New message. Kate, it's Simon. I've spoken to finance, your wages'll go into your new account, rather than Tom's, from now on. All right, mate. Voicemail deleted. Next new message. Hi, this is Hannah from Springall and Grant solicitors. We're ready to discuss your divorce options. If we could have a catch-up Wednesday at 4pm, that would be great. Many thanks. Daddy, come watch our show. In a minute. Can I film it? Course you can. Just give me a sec. I've got a training course at 4.00 on Wednesday, so I won't be back till a bit later. What training course? Some kind of literacy thing. It's going to be dull as shite. Hey. Hi. You going into town later? Yeah, I've got to pick up stuff for the ceilidh... Plates, cups... Oh, God, what was the other thing? Grab a padlock, will you? The one on the shed's busted. Padlock? Sure. Christ, what was I going for? Plates, cups... Bin bags. Bin bags. Thank you. Love to the girls. See you later. OK, bye. Come in. Nearly time, Tom. Yes, great. Ls that the right one? It better be. Nearly a tenner. Robbing bastards. Do you love him? Do you love Simon? We were talking about work. It's been going on a while, hasn't it? We were talking about work. All those board of governors' meetings. What? How long has it been going on? You leaving me? No, Emily, bed. Do you still love me? Oh, Jesus. You're so paranoid. Do you still love me? Of course, I do. You won't get the kids. Where is this coming from? I am going to ruin you. No, there's nothing going... I'll fucking ruin you! Stop! Emily! No more shouting. There's my big girl. Come on, come on. Oh, let's get you upstairs, come on. Tom? I'm sorry. All right, here we go. There you go. In you get. Love you lots. Love you, Dadda. Goodnight. Charlotte? Oh, my God. Tom? Emily? Emily? Emily! She's not breathing either. Iris? They're not breathing, Tom, they're not breathing, I... They deserved better than you. Kate? Mum, it's me. Ls everything all right? TOm? I just wanted you to know I tried my best. I did my best, Mum. Bye. Kate? Kate?! Lynn, Lynn, have you seen them? I think they're still in there. Kate! Kate! KATE! Come in. Dr Kendrick. What colour? Pink and red. Who's this? Iris. ls she your friend? Yeah. You were best pals, weren't you? Yeah. And what's this? A unicorn. Cos she gave you the balloon. Yeah. And what would you do if Iris was here, do you think? I'd say I'm sad that you're gone. That'd be nice. I would say thank you... ..for being kind. Do that bit there.
