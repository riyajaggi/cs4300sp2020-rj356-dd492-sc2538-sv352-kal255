Pine needles... ..in Emily's pyjamas... ..in her feet. And look at this. See here? They've all been injected with something. Any idea what? Toxicology are getting back to us as soon as they can. Might be time to give the Glasgow boys a call. Aye. MAN: Everything that lives... ..has its time on this planet. All the animals... ..all the flowers... ..all the people. Ready? Yeah. We all have time to do the things we like doing, like...laughing, and dancing, and playing with our friends. Most people get lots and lots of time... Why don't you get a seat in there and I'll...I'll go and fetch her? ..and they live to be very old. But, sometimes... ..people only get a little bit of time. {\an1}HIS VOICE CRACKS Last night something very sad happened. And I know it's very hard to understand. Charlotte... ..and Iris and Emily may not be with us any more... ..but they're all together with their mummy now. Let's take a moment to remember our wonderful friends, shall we? Let's remember them happy... ..and playing together. And we hope that Dr Kendrick gets better very soon. {\an1}DRIPPING WATER One origin, do you think? The kitchen, by the looks of it. What sort of timeframe are we looking at? Kate made a call to Carol, her mother-in-law, at 11:23. Carol couldn't hear anyone on the line, so she hung up. The first emergency call was 15 minutes later. This was padlocked? Yeah. From the outside. Christ. Go on, then. Hurry up. Just one thing to share, OK? Just eat it quietly. I've got it. All right, Elliot? I'll open it. Hi. CRYING: Oh, Jess... Oh... Hi, Carol. How is he? Maybe it would be best if he just went. Come on. You don't mean that. She was on antidepressants? A dose of 10mg. Ah...which you'd just dropped? Down from 20, yes. She had a hard time after Charlotte was born. The birth was traumatic, but she was feeling much better in herself, so... Was it depression? Or anxiety? A combination. She WAS feeling much better in herself. You not enjoying the film? It's for babies. Why don't you go upstairs and watch... No. Play with your computer, then. What's the point? It's not even interesting. Go and play upstairs. Are you hungry? Get a wee bit of chocolate. Elliot asked if he was gonna die too. You didn't tell ME that. Yes, I did. What did you say? Oh, I don't know, just some crap about how, you know, we'd always keep him safe. When? When did you tell me that? This morning. It just felt kind of, like, hollow, you know? Like, "Your friends are dead, there's a psycho out there, "but, hey, everything's gonna be fine." There's not a psycho out there. Four people have been murdered, Simon. I think we can be pretty sure. No, what I'm saying is... It must be a stranger. Let's not speculate. They were asking about Kate's medical history. Mark. Well, it's not a massive secret, is it? After Charlotte, you mean? It was hard for her, wasn't it? Poor thing. It happens, believe me. It's hormones. It has to be random. It's not random. Simon. It's not fucking random. It's not a stranger... OK. You're drunk. It's Tom. Jesus. Simon... I'll just go and check on the kids. {\an1}HE VOMITS {\an1}HE SOBS And you're sure it's all right for Molly to stay? Yeah. God, yeah. I'll just drop her back tomorrow. It'll be fine. I'm so sorry. It's fine. Go easy on him. Bye. Bye. Bye, Simon. You all right? Bye. Bye. Thanks, darling. Text me when you get back, yeah? I will. Cheers. OK. Night-night. Night. Bye. {\an1}Ow. DO they think it's Kate? I know. Sorry. It'll be a stranger. It's not Kate. {\an1}LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING {\an1}EXCITED CHATTER Charlotte! Let me see. She's fine, she's fine. Nana, Charlotte's fallen down! Oh, darling. She's fine. Why was she on her own? You're just a wee bit soggy, aren't you, darling? We weren't far away. Why wasn't somebody with her? She's fine. Someone should've been with her. Oh, fuck off, Carol! Grandad! Charlotte's hurt. It's all right. No harm done. Charlotte's hurt herself. Just a wee fall, she's fine. El, El, El. I'm just checking if she's OK. What's wrong with Mum? Jesus, she was trying to help. What? Nothing. Can we not have a nice time, just for one day? Always have to be about you? Fine. Go, if you're gonna be like this. Take the kids. Fine. Come on, don't be a prick. Kate! Kate. She OK? She does my head in when she's like this. I'll go. Are you sure? Not really. Thank you. Kate, I'll come with you. Come on. Come on, kids. Bye. Come on, girls. It's Charlotte's birthday. Leave the girls. Steve, we're going back. But I don't want to go. We're just gonna get in the car, OK? Did it hurt them, the fire? No. They were all asleep. It really, really hurt when I touched it. They were asleep, baby. They were all fast asleep. Stevo! You lot all right? Yeah. You see the bodies? What they look like? Resident Evil? Stay off the nox for one night, eh, Dylan? Stop it! Nice work on the padlock, Steve. And this... Yeah, this one's for you. Thank you. FROM COMPUTER: Try again. Aw, bad bounce. Dad! OK, ready? Go. Arrrgh! Hey, Doc! What are you doing? Is this your patient? Patient Iris. What's wrong, Iris? I hurt my leg at football, again. Oh. I think the doctor's gonna take care of you, don't worry. Oh, smoking a spliff on a school night?! Ooh. Is that on? No? It is, you bastard. Turn it off! Turn it off! {\an1}MOBILE RINGS AND VIBRATES Sergeant Campbell speaking. No, it's mine! Mummy! It's what they do, mother-in-laws. {\an5}You know, it's why they're here. You know, to make you feel bad. {\an5}Iris, it's Charlotte's go. But she had it before. I don't care. Give it to her. No! {\an5}Mummy... I mean, why do you care what she thinks, anyway? {\an5}Mum! I mean, it's Tom that matters. And he fricking adores you. {\an5}It's mine. Is that right? But Iris, I'm really bored. I don't care. Mummy! Just give it to her! Give it to her now! {\an1}TYRES SCREECH {\an1}PHONE RINGS AND VIBRATES Hi. You gave us such a fright. What did she do?
