 Happy birthday. Happy birthday! ON PHONE: Simon's organising another karaoke night. Oh, please, no. I think he fancies you. I see the way he looks at you every time you walk in the room. I think he's quite hot, for a headmaster. He's quite attractive, I suppose. Till he opens his mouth. Jess, he literally said, "There's no I in team." I said, "There might not be an I in team, "but there are a fair few twats, if you look hard enough." How's Jess? Yeah, good. Ah... Did you come? I'm tired. Jess came when I fucked her. Mum's been on the phone about Charlotte's birthday. She'll probably just meet us at the beach now. But she was asking about the cake. Is she making it, or is Ruth? She said something about a unicorn theme. Is that right? Princesses, I get. Unicorns? Are they a thing now? I don't know. Girls! Three minutes warning! Love you. Bye, Dad. See you, girls. Love you, Daddy. OK, don't forget your bag. Got it. Bye, Dad. Drunk all the water in the...? Vase. In the vase? Will you set the table? Why Jess? Why Sasha? Why is it always the friends I love the most? I really hope you're not going to be like this when Mum gets here. Just get a new one. It's a good boiler. But you've no water or heating! It's done well. It must be 40 years old now. Jesus Christ. It'll be spouting carbon monoxide. Tell her. This is lovely. Is there any more? Sure. Help yourself. Sit down, Mum. I don't mind. Kate'll do it. Honestly, it's fine. She doesn't mind, Tom. Get her some fucking food. CHILD: Please, can we have another story? No. Please. No more stories. Did you love your wife, Tom? Yes. And did she love you? Yes. I don't know what else you want me to say. I'm now showing Tom a tablet with a video on it. Do you mind having a look at this for us, please? Sure. Go ask Dad to film it, he'll take it. OK. Daddy, come watch our show. In a minute. Can I film it? Yeah, course you can. Just give me a sec. OK. {\an1}CHILDREN SING IN BACKGROUND Do you know when that was taken? No idea. About 24 hours before the fire. Well, I'll have to take your word for that. What...you don't remember taking it? No. You look quite emotional there, Tom. Really? Mmm. As if you're trying to say something. Well, what do you think it looks like? Like I didn't realise my phone was on. Looks to me as if you wanted to get something off your chest. No. Tom, you don't have to answer. I know. I just want you to be aware. I'm aware, Nicky. Thank you, thank you. Where did you train, Tom? ..did I train? To be a GP. Edinburgh. So, you've got, what, a PhD? No. I did seven years of medical training. OK. Can you explain to us how insulin works? Erm, insulin is needed by the body to regulate sugar levels. And if you have too much? Is that what she used? Who injected you, Tom? Kate...in the girl's bedroom. Why didn't you put up a fight, Tom? There was nothing to fight for. Not even your own life? My three children were dead in front of me. How do you know they were dead? I'm a doctor. I've seen death. I know... I know death. Where do you think Kate got the insulin from? At a guess, I would say my bag. Which was where? In the car. I keep it in the boot of the car. Why did you have insulin in your bag? In case of emergencies. Is that usual procedure? What do you mean? Well, do most doctors carry insulin? I can't speak for most doctors. I'm just wondering whether it's common practice. Well, it's common practice for me. OK. Thank you. Er...take a quick break, shall we? Err, same again? Bit stronger this time, if you don't mind, yeah. Sure. Look at him. He looks so relaxed. He defers to you, did you notice? He thinks I'm a soft touch. Stupid fucker. All right, mate. How are you? Should be strong enough, that. Stand your spoon up in it. Thank you. Right. Interview restarting at... What time you got? 3:30. 15:30. Sergeant Steve Campbell is now present. OK. Could you tell us what we're looking at here? It's a map of the village. And could you point out your house for us? Here. {\an5}And what's this? You know what that is, Steve. It's the forest. And your garden leads directly into it. That's correct, yeah. What does that look like to you? Put them away, please. They're pine needles. Emily was seen outside 15 minutes before the fire. That's not possible. Why would that be? Would you put them away, please? We have an eyewitness who saw her in the woods. And they saw you, too. You were dragging her back towards your house. No. She was scared and screaming. Who told you that? And you brought her back to this. WHO TOLD YOU THAT? So, how do you explain the pine needles? Look... Kate lost it, all right? Emily got scared. She ran. Kate chased her. Kate lost it. Yeah. About what? She was chatting to Simon at the ceilidh. Simon Wells? Yes. I just... I was asking her what she was talking to him about. And what did she say? Nothing. That, was it. She lost it. She lost it because you asked about Simon? Yeah. Up there in that room? Yes. If she lost it upstairs, in that room with you... ..when did she inject the girls? Was it before or after she ran after Emily? You say she injected you in the kids' bedroom. Is that right? That's what you said. "My three children were dead in front of me." That's right, yeah. Except they weren't in front of you, were they? I found you in your bedroom. I walked away when I saw what she'd done. You walked away... Yeah. ..when you saw what she'd done. When I saw, yeah. But that's not what you've been saying, is it? So, which is it? Which is the truth? Or is it all a lie, Tom? Is everything you've said here a lie, Tom? No comment. Name? Thomas Kendrick. Date of birth? 23rd of September, 1971. And you know why you're on remand? Yeah. Jumper off. And your T-shirt as, well. And turn around. All the way. Arms down. Anything in your mouth? Wider. Look straight ahead. Are you on any medication at all? No. Smoker? Occasional. Do you want any nicotine patches? No, no. I'm fine. And are you feeling depressed or suicidal? I'm fine. OK. This is for you. Does your next of kin know where you are? ..E-S. S, for sugar, 1543. Mum, are you writing this down? You'll need it or you won't be able to visit. Look, I've got two minutes. Have you got a pen? Good job, mate. Night. Cheers. Well. Cheers. Cheers. {\an1}SHE EXHALES You're wasted down here, Steve. I don't know. No, I'm... I'm serious. I can see. That's a very serious face you've got there. You could do way better than this shithole. It's not a shithole. All right, defensive. Think about it. I'll think about it. No, you won't. I could come back with you. I know. {\an1}DOOR CLOSES Just so you know, whatever you say here is completely confidential. Sure. You've been feeling anxious? Not particularly. You put you've felt anxious more than half the days. Did I? Well, I suppose I've been... ..feeling a bit on edge, maybe. A bit uneasy. I'm not sure if that's... If that's the right word, so. Uneasy about what? I don't know. How do you cope with those feelings? I go for a walk with the dog, watch telly. Just... You know... I did not chase her out there. That's for us to disprove, then. Who's the witness? They can't tell us. They've been classed as a vulnerable, so... Do you know who took the statement? DCI Collins, DC Darlington. That's the official statement, though, right? Who'd he go to before? I don't know. It'll be Steve. Tom. It'll be Steve, I'm telling you. See what you can find out. It's not that easy. Oh, fuck's sake. Find out. Just find out. There's a lot going against you, Tom. There's circumstantial evidence - the mortgages, the debts. Fuck you. Are you saying you no longer require my services? I'm saying fuck you. I'll see what I can do. Good. No promises. Jesus. So how was the counselling? Waste of time. Asked about dreams and all the crap. Told you. Nicky's here. Great. What's she want? Hopefully working up a plea deal. Been on at you already, has he? He's persistent, I'll give him that. For persistent, reads pain in the arse. I couldn't possibly comment. Listen, is there somewhere we can talk? Why not something that doesn't taste of pish? It's on offer. Two for one. You were nicking them, Dylan. All right, Steve-oh? You going to give me a lift home? One too many times, Dyl. Ah, man. Really? Sorry, mate. 20 quid's worth of booze. It's hardly worth the paperwork, eh? Ten quid, cos of the offer. Shut up about the offer. All right. CLEARS THROAT Full name. Oh, come on, Steve-oh. Name. You fucking owe me one. You know you do. Name, Dylan. Dylan Francis Denham-Johnson. Forward, please. Arms out. You get here OK? Bit of traffic, but... I'm sorry. I need you to do some things for me, OK, Mum? I need you to order some books for me. The police told me about the girls. A few legal books. I'll e-mail you the titles. The insulin in their blood. You know your e-mail? How did insulin get in their blood? The one I set up for you, the Google account. You remember the password? I've got it written down somewhere. Now, look, the legal aid they've given me is a piece of shit. We might need to think about re-mortgaging the farm again. I don't know I can. Just give the bank a call. Give them a call. And maybe, erm... Maybe what? How are Ruth and Callum? I haven't seen them. Maybe see if they'll help. Mum? Don't you already owe them money? Just go and see them. It's fucked me up in the head. Got me all paranoid and shit. That's the skunk, Dylan. I don't know if I can do it, Steve-oh. Maybe I could change my statement. What would your mum and dad say? Maybe you could talk to somebody. It's too late. It's done. Maybe you could... You're not fucking changing it. You're not changing it. All right? Fuck. Get off that shit, Dylan. {\an1}HE SIGHS Fuck. She was running... ..and she fell and he caught up with her. Who did? Her dad. How's the sleep? I've been having these...dreams. About the fire? They're just dreams. What do you see? They're just dreams. You've experienced significant trauma, Steve. Anyone would be scarred by what you went through. We got him... ..the guy who did it. The father. How do you feel about that? Good. Justice for Kate, for those little girls. I feel good. Good. {\an1}HE SIGHS SANDRA: You should come to a class, Jess. I'm starting up Keep Fit again in the school hall. Thursday's circuits. You should come. Yeah, I'm trying to, erm, take it easy at the moment though, so... Oh, God, yeah, of course. But when do you do the test? A week. Right, well, I've got my fingers crossed. Aye. Fingers crossed, eh? Talking of which... Er, Luke. What? No, I was, er... Well, I wanted to wait for the right moment to... Man's got a beer in his hand. When's better? It's gonna be fucking obvious soon anyway, isn't it? You're not. Mm. Four months. That is amazing. Congratulations. Oh, thank you. I... I was scared to tell you, but... Don't be stupid. No, that's great news. Thank you. Thanks, Jess. Aye, congratulations. Thanks. Weren't even trying really, were we? Well, we were doing it a lot. {\an1}THEY LAUGH Dad, can I have 50p? You still sulking? No, I'm not. Here you go, pal. Take that. Oh, thanks, Luke. Right, shall I come play with you? Yeah. Come on then, going up! {\an1}HE GRUNTS Right, who are we going to be? Shall I be on your team? Yeah. Shall I put it in? I'll put it in. You put it in. I'm Scotland, yous are Spain. Scotland-Spain. Come on, the Scots! We're going to beat you. Right, in you go. Go, go, go. Why'd you tell them about the IVF? I told Sandra. Why did you tell Sandra? Because she's Sandra. I mean, I don't know what your problem is, Steve. Teeth! Just because you don't talk to anyone... I'll be checking. ..about anything doesn't mean that I can't. You haven't even asked me how I'm feeling. How are YOU feeling? Do you know, you can be a right fucking arsehole sometimes, Steve. {\an1}CHILDREN SHOUT Boys! Keep it down, please. Bed. I'm the arsehole, am I? HE SCOFFS Coming from you. What do you want? Huh? Do you want me to move out, or...? I can't fucking stand this. Tell me what you want. Steve. What was it like? What? Fucking him. {\an1}SHE SIGHS Was there foreplay? What? Did you suck his cock, Jess? I'm not having this conversation. He go down on you, hey? Hm? Steve. Did he kiss you? Steve. Steve, stop. Stop. Where did he touch you? Steve. Steve! STOP! I want you not to have fucked him. That's what I want. There you go. Thanks, Kate. {\an1}SHE SNIFFLES, EXHALES Hi, Carol, how are you? Fine, thanks. What can I help you with? I'd like to close my account please. Of course. Can I get that in tens or twenties for you? Twenties would be good. Maybe you could do sandwiches or... He shouldn't speak to you like that. You could stay over the night before if that's easier. I don't like it when he speaks to you like that. You know the kids'd love that... ..if you stayed over. There you go. Thank you. {\an1}BELL RINGS {\an1}BUZZER BLARES Tom. Come on out, mate. Don't make me ask you again. Wait. Right, come on. It's time. Keep breathing out. Thanks. You been the Lamb and Flag? Gastro food, craft beers, all that wank. We could go this evening, if you like. Can I have a word? Aye. Sure. We know it's Tom. Oh, Jesus! Are you trying to justify yourself? No, I'm just... Yeah, you are. We got him, even without Dylan. He'll get out, Steve. You coerced a witness. You fucked it! Fuck! Maybe it's best you just take a bit of a break, eh? Aye. He fucked your girlfriend. Is that what this comes down to? Hm? I just wanted it over. Men and their fucking egos! {\an1}TOILET FLUSHES Come on. Come on! {\an1}It was doing my head in, Steve-o! What's that? I had one glass. Oh, come on, Kate! Tom has me on these pills! Antidepressants. I don't know what all of them are. Jesus! Maybe if you could do a blood test? They make me... I don't know what I'm doing half the time. When was the last time you had a spliff? The girls were in the car. Jess was in the car. I had one small glass. He'll kill me one day. Get a fucking grip! Fuck! I love you.
