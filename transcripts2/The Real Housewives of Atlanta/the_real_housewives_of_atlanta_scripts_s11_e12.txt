 - I am the glue for my wig and my family. - I age like a fine wine, and now I am ready to chill. - I count my blessings and my checks. - I live a model life. Now, I'm ready to be a top wife. - I may be an open book, but that doesn't mean I'm easily read. - I took a lotta left turns, but now things are just right. ♪ ♪ - I wanna get a close up on todd. ♪ - there you go, kandi. - What you want us to do, now? ♪ ♪ and scene. It's gettin' a little hot over here. I had this great idea that I wanted to shoot, like, a commercial for the dungeon party slash variety show. - So, where are we goin', babe? - Let's be clear. Scared money don't make no money. I'm hoping to at least make it back and then some. So, I think it's gonna work. ♪ - what is goin' on in here? - Hey, girl. - Hey, gorgeous. It is giving me very-- - watch the steps. - Watch her skirt. - Ooh. - Excuse me. Swagg comin' through. [laughing] - you're the first girl in the group to come to the dungeon. [laughing] - yes! Well, let me get comfortable, honey. - Oh, girl, let me take a seat. - I'm gonna let y'all have this. I gotta make sure that they're gettin' dressed and stuff. - Good to see you, booby. - You, too. - But, yeah, I think this-this is gonna be a real fun situation. It's something different where it's, like, a little bit burlesque, a little bit variety show, and a little bit of a party. - Yes. - Yeah, this will be great to be able to-- - you employ a lotta people doing that, too. - I always try to employ a lotta people. - Yeah, that's dope. - Girl, it was a dream of mine about ten years ago to at least be able to employ 100 people a year at least. - Shut up. - But now I do more than that through the one restaurant. So, now I gotta step up my goals. - Yes, and you got the other one opening 'cause I saw todd put somethin' on instagram. I liked it the other day. I was like, hold up-- gotta go to this one. - Yeah, so, anyway, this is gonna be somethin' fun, and it was making something positive out of something that used to be bad. So, this is similar. - Yes. Yeah, so, that's your theme. That's what you do. - Yeah, because I'm-I'm not good at expressing myself sometimes. It's so weird. People will be like, "why don't you say "how you feel or whatever?" - yeah, me, too. Well, I-I feel like, especially in this group, it's so weird. - Mm-hmm. - Like, the dynamics. I thought I was developing relationships with certain people, and then it's like, okay, but a friend wouldn't do that. - So, who were you-- who did you feel-- - porsha, and it's just weird. - Oh. [laughing] oh, yeah. - Because I really thought that we were getting to, like, a cool place, but then we get in front of the room, and it's like, "hey, are you shady?" since hibachi night, I have been extremely conflicted. - Eva, you caught that shade, but you be forgettin' your shade. - Ut-oh. - Have you ever been shady with cynthia? - So, kandi, help me. Explain to me. Sensei, teach me. What should do in this situation? Like, it's a full sos. - I don't know. I mean, I, myself, I've been through that with her. I mean, when me and her first met, I was being friends with her. - Y'all was cool. - We was cool, and then, all of a sudden, I felt like she started shading the sh-- out of me. [laughing] so, it's like-- - but where does it come from? - I don't know. - Like, when do you know when the switch is gonna flip? - It's so weird. I don't understand her sometimes. I feel like anything that you are feeling, uh, you need to address it because when the communication is not there, stuff just gets worse. - Yeah. - I know that some of the girls feel like you say one thing when the people aren't around, and then when people are around, then you don't say that same thing, or you may play it down. - Oh, not the veteran walk. - Yes. [laughing] - you never said she was like the mother of the den? - When? - When we were at the gym. - No shade-- I'm gon' pass the peach. Here, sham-- - wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So, you didn't say I needed a makeover? - No. - I did not. No, no, no. - My girl, eva, I love you to death, but sometimes you do things that are taken as shade, and I feel like sometimes you could just own it and move on. But, at the same time, it's just like, if you were saying it as a joke, you shoulda just said it to cynthia because, obviously, when you say it to anybody when that person is not around, they come back and twist it. - What friend does that? - Hey, man, if somebody come at you with the drama, you gotta deal with it right then. [laughing] yeah, I know you're trying to be nice girl. - It's not that I'm trying to be nice girl, but that I-- when I get to the other side, the other side don't have a lotta pullback. - Ooh. - So, I try to stay on this side 'cause this side is a beast. Look, I am trying to stay on this yoga mat. My white flag is up, and I feel like they are begging for eva the diva to come out. I just hope that when we go on this trip, it's fun. Do you gotta pull her? - I got to. - Okay, she solved some of the world's issues today for me, so that's okay. It's very good. - I don't know if it's gonna ever be solved with this group, but-- [laughing] - I love it. ♪ [knocking] [laughing] - what's goin' on? - Hey. Muah. - Hi. - Look. - What is it? - That's the baby bed. - Girl, it's too early for a baby bed. [laughing] are y'all for real? You done tried it. That's a hot mess, porsha. - Ain't it, though? - I mean-- I mean-- [laughing] ain't even got a toe yet, honey. - Ain't even got a toe or a back. [laughing] you know, I be so tired, girl. I ain't even had time to go get my hair done. - I know. In the beginning, you don't have no energy. - This is makeup from even yesterday. - Uh-uh. ♪ really, girl? Why haven't you washed your face?

You know how I feel about chips and salsa. - Well, yeah, but that was just from-- - not from yesterday. - No, not from yesterday. - I'm like, well, damn, over here eatin' yesterday's dip. Are you ready to go to japan? - Uh, no, I'm not. - Why? - I haven't even found anything to wear. My only thing is, like, the hours, the flight, how it long it is. And I'm about to be out of my first trimester. So-- - oh, that's good. - I've already told most of my family. So, really, the only people who don't know are the rest of the girls. - I'm sure they'll be happy for you and everything. - Yeah, so, I wanna do somethin', like, when we get there. - Like, an announcement? - Like, announce. Like, tell the rest of the girls. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. - Yeah. Now that I've passed the danger zone of when you're not supposed to tell people you're pregnant, I feel comfortable enough now to let the girls in on the secret. Plus, I barely got past the destin trip without them knowing. So, yeah, I definitely need to go ahead and let them know. - Well, you know the last time you and I saw each other really was at tanya's. - Yes. - You and kandi at tanya's, the way you guys were carrying on. - Oh, yeah.

Uh-uh. You know, for me, nene, I really hope that, on this trip, I just don't have to get into it with anybody, and I damn sure don't wanna get into it with her. - I don't think that she's gonna say anything. - Okay, good, and please, y'all don't either. - I won't. - Okay. - I think kandi and porsha will get along in tokyo because they have an understanding. I don't (bleep) wit' you, and you don't (bleep) with me, but we can smile and laugh together. - I'm just gonna be damn zen. Anybody say anything to me, I'll be like, mmm. Um, I swear to god.

[laughing] - well, ladies, so, I found us a really great asset that's going to come with us and just kinda lead us through the trip. Eva's already told us about how she got arrested here years ago because of a cultural misunderstanding. - I worked here a lot, like, as a model, so I'd be here, like, two and a half months. - Oh, my god. - They thought we were coming out here to work. - There's a whole bunch of customs and different things that we are gonna have to tackle to kind of get through the next couple of days.

[applause] - take it away, aya. - Hi, everyone. - Hello. - My name is aya. - Hey, aya. - I will be your guide for this trip. So, I'm going to tell you some very important parts in japan. First of all, be punctual. - Oh. - Be punctual, guys. - Oh, okay. - So, if you are late-- - yes. - I would think, oh, you guys are underestimating me. - Oh, honey, it is disrespectful. These girls are known for lateness. 'cause if you were here for me, you'd have been here long before midnight, now. I'm keeping it 100 wit' y'all. Good night. - Whose sh-- is that? - I was trying to be cool to y'all, but, you know, being late is not proper. - Who's late? Where is everybody else? - You're late, bitch. You just got here. - Am I late? - In the meantime, we will continue to wait on our very, very, very late guest. - I mean, these girls are, like, late five hours. That's not okay. - So, what time tomorrow? - Eleven a.M., okay? - Eleven a.M. - Eleven a.M. - Wonderful, yes. - Okay. - Get ready, freddy. - I can definitely be on time for that. - Customs and traditions in tokyo are very important to the people of tokyo. And, like, this group, sometimes you can be shady or disrespectful and not even know it. - Thank you, guys. - Thank you. - Arigato. - All right, so, I want to thank everybody now that we have a couple of libations going around. - Yes, for the libations. - Yes, everybody get properly lubricated. This trip I wanted to come to and celebrate my upcoming nuptials. Um, I did not invite everyone, to, uh, miami, more importantly, nene, and so I wanted this as an opportunity to kinda, you know, apologize. ♪ however, I wanted to set the tone for how I normally rock. And, for me-- - yes, for rocking, honey. - Yes. - Okay, rock it out. - If there is anything that anyone needs to get off of their chest, they can do so. And I will actually start with porsha. - Wait, now. Hold on. I'm gonna need some vodka, so I can relax my wig, honey. ♪ - coming up next... Ninshin-chuu. - What does that mean? - It means... ♪ ♪ - I will actually start with porsha. - Wait, now. Hold on. - I like you, porsha. I felt like you and I started to get to know each other. But when we were at tanya's house doing hibachi, out of nowhere, it was like, "eva, are you shady?" to, like, throw me on blast in front of everybody, you started on me a little bit. I thought we were friends. That's a character assassination. - A character assassination? - Yes. Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh, well, I don't know if it was that deep. I don't understand why eva has such a big issue with her being shady. Maybe you're just guilty 'cause guilty people really don't wanna be labeled. Welcome to the group. You fit right in, bitch. If I notice something that you're doing and it's a pattern, and I bring it up to you, you know, I don't expect you to be walking around hurt about it. You could bring it up to me, but don't act like I'm coming at you. I specifically remember you shading cynthia. Shamea instance, that was another one. You literally talked about shamea like a dog. And then when you saw her, you were like, "girl, you want me to make you some food?" - so, what I'ma do? Fight with her while she's pregnant? - But I think what porsha is sayin' is, you're-- the way you behaved when you saw her was a little different from the way you felt. You were, like, overly nice when you don't really deal with her like that. - I wasn't overly nice, but I was definitely pleasant. - You were very nice. It just seemed fake. - I don't want you, like, going and being, like, porsha's always coming at me. You know, uh-uh. Don't-don't play the victim on me like that, 'cause I'm a very nice person. - No one played the victim, and no one said that. - I'm love and light, as well. - What I said, was that you-- I felt like you stunted on me. - I'm not a stunter, either. I stunt back. - I know, in this group of women, if you're gonna talk a certain behind their back, somebody is going to call you out. Porsha is calling eva out on her sh--. - That wasn't no hot seat, girl. I did not come for you. - It was like a warm seat. - It was not. - That scares me. So, she will talk behind my back, and as soon as you seem, you're gonna be, "hi," 'cause I'm pregnant. No, bitch, don't speak to me. - Well, why don't you put your stuff on the table, marlo? I thought you said you had heard somethin'. - I did. I told her I heard what the street said. I heard that you talked about me like a cat. - Like a cat? [laughter] - what does that mean? - Less than a dog. - I was like, wow, really? The person who texts me all the time. The person who reaches out to me. Like, talked about me like a cat. - Girl, bye. Ain't nobody told you I talk about you like a dog. - They didn't say like a dog. - Like a cat. [laughter] is there anything else need to be put on the table? - Anything else? Nene, let me talk to you real quick. - Oh, yes, honey. I live for a talk. Bye, y'all. I'm gettin' ready to go to bed. - Okay, so, what's the rest of us doing? - I don't know. - Come and let me talk to you. Sit right here real quick. - I just want a nice, easy, simple trip with a little bit of debauchery. - Wishful thinking. - We're gonna have that. - So, I'm gonna tell them tonight. - Oh, you are? - Yes. - I asked them, how do you say, "I'm pregnant", in japanese? Um, how do you say, "I'm pregnant", in japanese? - Ning? - Ninshin. - Ninshin. - Chuu. - Chuu. - Like chew. - Chuu, okay. Ninshin-chuu. See the little gong? So, I'ma get the gong. - Uh-huh. Okay. - And I'm gonna teach them ninshin-chuu. - So, kandi, what's going on? Like, how are you and porsha? Like, have y'all talked? - No, you know we haven't talked. Looking back at the situation, I just feel like it got outta control. So, with that being said, I just wanna move on. Have a good ol' trip. - Me first. Me first. Okay, me first. - I'm gonna get this right. - Okay, you go. Me or you? [banging gong] - yes. [laughing] [banging gong] - oh, my god, what is this about? - Attention, everyone. Porsha and I are gonna play a little game with you guys. - Mm-mm. - So, I'm gonna first teach y'all something to say in japanese, okay? - Yes. - Okay. - All right, you ready? - Yes. - Ninshin-chuu. [all] - ninshin-chuu. - One more time. Let's hear it. [all] - ninshin-chuu. - What does that mean? [banging gong] - it means... I'm pregnant! [screaming, applause] a baby is coming! - I knew porsha was pregnant because you weren't drinking, and you were detoxing. - All shade aside, porsha's gonna be a real good mom, and the baby's [indistinct] down eco style. - Honestly, I don't know how long porsha was gonna be able to hide it because she is definitely poppin', front and back at this point. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Cheers! - Congratulations, porsha. Ninshin-chuu. - I am super excited for porsha, right now, because regardless of my opinions and thoughts about her relationship, I am happy that she is finally gonna be able to be a mother. - I knew she was with child. - Yeah, my hormones have been crazy. So, if I've been any bit of anything else than my sweet angel self, that was the hormones. - You're gonna blame it on the pregnancy. - Would you like to know what rooms you're staying in? Mother with baby in utero? - Oh, yes, please. - Um, we made sure all the rooms are the same. Everybody has a suite. - Aw. - No room is better than the other. It literally is the same exact room. - All right, well, me and my baby need to go to bed. - Does anyone have any, uh, flat shoes I can wear? 'cause I can't wear these heels anymore? I gotta act like y'all. Carry me. - Ain't nobody foot your size. Come on. Ooh! - She can carry me. - Eva, oh, god, don't hurt yourself. - I guess you got the cat on your back. [laughter] - coming up next... My mama said that... ♪ - okay. How do you get this thing open? Oh, got it. ♪ - hey, babe, I wish you answered the phone, but I know this time difference is wicked.
