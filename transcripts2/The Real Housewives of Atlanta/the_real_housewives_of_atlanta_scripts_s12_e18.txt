At the end of the day, you're gonna know that she got the best wine that you can find anywhere. - Right. - And I didn't-- we didn't get to that point. - Well, that didn't happen. - Fun shade doesn't apply when it's, like, your business. Ooh, that's-- that just bothers me. - That's true. And the bottom line is, she would not have received it had I done that to her. - Oh, my goodness. - So... - Even if you joke one time, it wouldn't work. - Right. - Like, if you said, "I used your haircare, and, look, my edge is still gone," you'd be like-- she'll be like-- - It would be-- - Right.

This is a very fragile moment for Kenya. It kinda explains the way she behaves. So, I just kinda give her a pass. Well, I definitely, uh, I receive it, and I appreciate you guys bringing it to my attention, honestly. But what I'm not gonna do, is let Kenya be purposely just mean or disrespectful. - So, um, we're gonna go, so you can get some rest, but, um, can we exchange and get one of your bracelets? - I was like, they're so pretty. - I'll take this one.

I give a lot of very good blow jobs. Come on,. - Damn it. Does her mouth ever get tired? - Who doesn't wanna wake up to that? That is the key to happiness. - Yes. - Paul got it good. That's probably the reason why they hadn't got married yet. - I have to ask NeNe. NeNe has had the longest relationship of anybody. What do you think matters the most? - Yes, Lord, what is-- what-- yeah. - You know what? I think it's the love and the respect. - That's it. - Gregg is a family man. He can go up, or I up.

I don't know if we've broken, but we've been there. People fall into situations they-they shouldn't fall into. - Right. - Yeah. - So, that doesn't mean he doesn't love you. - Right. - Just because a man cheat doesn't mean he's a bad man. - Right. - And it doesn't mean that he didn't love his wife or his family. - Right. - That's when your communication need to be real hardcore. - Right. - You guys really got to communicate. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? - I definitely miss NeNe being able to give me advice.

I'm gonna do for you what we call a-a tutored tasting. - Yes, I love to taste. - Do you have wine, and crackers, and salami? - Yes. - Not wine, crackers, and salami. - Oh, wow, look how beautiful this is! - Please have a seat wherever you, um, wherever you like.

Then we need to smell it. - Wow. - Oh. - So, you put your whole nose in there. - Yes, and then we'll swirl the wine, and we'll do it like this. And then, we either spit or swallow. It's, uh, it's up to us. - I have a preference. - And then we will-- - What do you do, Tanya? You spit, or you swallow? - I mean, if it's a good bottle, I'm definitely swallowing. - Whoa. I'll be spitting, please. Thank you. - In some cases, I have a hard time, you know, deciding myself. - Thank you so much. - Smell it before swirling. - Oh, wow. - And, uh, you have a taste. - This is really good. It's really nice. - What makes a bottle of wine, like, more expensive? The year? - Oh, wow. - Uh, it's the year. - Mm-hmm. - But it's also how you promote it, how you sell it. The real value is the myth. - If I brought it back personally or whatever, it's from Greece. Yeah. - The myth. So, now I'm going to offer you a beautiful rose. - Smells good. - Yeah, it's very flowery, a-a-a little sweet spice. - Oh, I will tear this bottle up. This is good. - Rose wines are very, very popular. - I literally can't keep it in the cellar. - Mmm. No, I know, yeah. - We sell out of our roses first. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - Is-is that your bestseller? - Mm-hmm. - You know what I'm thinking would be good? Do a bottle and put a picture of me on it. That would be great branding. - Maybe for one of my more high-end brands. - I'll tell you what will sell, if we all did a wine together. Now, that will sell. - Oh, my gosh, now that would be-- - Now, that will sell. - You better say somethin'. Would you guys really do that? - I would do it. - Okay. - Let me figure out somethin'. - It's not my thing, but if it's somethin' to help you, yes. - Girl, brilliant! - Can I get a picture with you? - Sure. - Of course. - Come on. Come on. - Okay, wait, wait, come here. I want to talk... I want to talk to you real quick. Oh, God. - I know. - Are we talking over here? - Just here, look how beautiful it is. - Where are you guys going? - We're gonna chat, real quick. - Uh, okay. - Bye, chile. - Shopping! - This way, ladies. - Oh, wow. - Thank you. - Oh, wow. So, Ted, tell us what we can ship to Atlanta. - Yes. - There's wines, the wines that you tasted and some more. - How many fit in there, in the box? - That's so cute. - Oh, I think this is for three or four. - Three? I'd like to buy my friend one of each of the wines that we tasted. - That can be done. - Who is your friend? - Okay, your-your three favorite. - As in me? - Yes, as in you. - Oh, my God, thank you. - So can I have the first one? I loved, and she loved the rose, and then the last one red. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Uh, this evil eye bracelet is the real deal. - I wanted to pull you aside because-- - Yes. - Since I came to your event-- - Yeah. - Which I appreciated you inviting me 'cause I didn't get invited to the first animal print party that you had privately. - Ha-ha! Eva came, bitch. - Uh-huh, but I wasn't invited. I woulda came. It was down the damn street. It was down the street. - But-- so, I appreciated that. - Yeah. - And, of course, we had an understanding, at that point. We were like, okay, we're just gonna just lay it surface. But I'm not that person to not forgive somebody, but I love you to the point to where it's like I can't forgive her 'til she understand what happened. - Mm-hmm. - Going to therapy with Dennis, it makes me think about the long-term value of a relationship. You know, the reason why I have been so hurt by NeNe is because I valued our friendship. It really got strong through the years. - This is a sisterhood, and we-we have highs and lows, and you have to know how to push through those low moments. Well, I'm glad you felt the need to come talk to me, though. I feel like a real big sister. - I love you. - Love you. You can just have this all just to play in the house. Know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, just walk around, cookin' up some eggs. - I'm excited! Ahh! This is gonna be everything. Push. - What happened between us was unfortunate. - Yeah. - I wanna talk about the closet. Did something happen with your belt? Porsha, I will you up. - Take my mic. I don't wanna be in here no more. I'm scared. - So, you're sayin' I-I touched you. You're sayin' I put my hand on your back. - Yeah. Now, I don't give a what she was going through at the time because what she did was uncalled for. But what I know, is that I love the person that's in front of me, and I wanna move past it, period. Even though I feel like we have had-- been on the outs before, we have said ugly stuff to each other before, this time was extra sensitive to me because I was pregnant. - Yeah. - Like, in the beginning when I had just had PJ, it was really hard 'cause I was trying to breastfeed. I had gone into postpartum depression. Literally, NeNe, when I was texting you, the baby, she was right here. And I took my titty out of her mouth, put her down right here, and went online and posted it. So, the timing of you and I havin' this war was, like, the worst possible time for me, period. Like, I couldn't forgive because it had hurt me that deep because it was at such a vulnerable time. - Mm-hmm. - And I just felt like you didn't care. And so, when I felt like you didn't care, I let go of who we were. - Yeah. - Out of everybody in the group that I have had issues with, that hurt me the most because I-I genuinely love you. I genuinely look up to you. but this sh-- that we are arguing about has got us so far apart. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ - I genuinely look up to you. but this sh-- that we are arguing about has got us so far apart. - I'm sorry. I know what it is to be in postpartum. I mean, obviously, I'm a mother. I've had two kids. So, I-I feel bad that I said anything that may have hurt her. At the end of the day, Porsha, I love you like a big sister. That's real, and I wanna be your sister. I wanna be here for you and PJ, I do. I don't wanna see you hurt. I wanna be able to talk to you openly, and I wanna still have that friendship. When my husband was-- said that he had cancer, you guys don't know how hard that was for me. - Mm-hmm. - That was the worst time in my life, the worst time in my marriage. - Mm-hmm. - And I felt just closed off, just shut down, like I didn't have you guys to come to. I don't know. I-I can't explain it. - And it was comin' from every-every-- I was crushed. I felt like, if he left, I wouldn't have anybody. - I don't want you to feel like that, and I do support you. I am here for you. I do pray for you. - Mm-hmm. - But I feel like you were already in a certain space. - Mm-hmm. - Where you were like these girls don't have my back. These girls don't support me. You just weren't willing to hear us, at that moment. - Last year was the most trying time in my entire life, and I needed my friends to see that I'm not always the strong woman. When things become too much, I just instantly shut down. I'm just glad to be in a better place. - I appreciate your honesty. - Okay. - And I want you to know, as a friend, there are certain boundaries that I'm not gonna cross with you no more. And I'm gonna respect how you wanna be treated. - Mm-hmm. - And I feel like you will also respect-- - I will, I will. - How I wanna be treated as a friend. - I will, I will. Mm-hmm. - This is totally different for NeNe and I because this is the first time we've actually made a decision within our friendship that we were gonna do better. When somebody is by your side, you can't just act that's nothing because you're mad. Stop cryin'. I'm sorry. I love you. - I love you, and I miss you so much. - Thank you, baby. - I miss you much, NeNe. - Thank you. - It's been really hard without you. - I'm sorry, Porsha. - Okay. It's okay. - I'm sorry. You're gonna have to get me some lash glue, bitch. Just take 'em off. Like, what the-- who cares? - I don't like those. Those are like creepy crawlers. - But your ----in' lashes are dirty. They are dirty. I had 'em on for three days. - That was really sweet of you. - Oh, really? Thank you. - Yeah, to get her the box of wine to take with her. That was nice. - Oh, I want her to win. You know what I'm sayin'? - Right. - Come on, you guys. We're gonna drink our asses off 'til we get back. - I have a wine opener under my chair. Ooh. - We're about to drink on the mother---in' bus! - What? - We're about to drink on the mother---in' bus! - Not on the mother----in' bus. - On the mother---in' bus. - Okay, well, I guess it's on. - Whoo! I love this trip. - I do, too. ♪♪♪ - Come on, guys. Let's go. - Where you gonna sit, Miss Moore? - Uh, I'll sit here. - I like being at the end, so I can run off and leave when the drama comes. - Does anyone know where the restroom is? - No. - Absolutely not. Oh, wow. - Look at these cats. That's why I can't live here. God, with these cats. Go away. - Uh-uh, get your ass on. Get your ass on. This is not your friend. - Where's Tanya? - She went to the ladies' room. - That's why it's so quiet over here. - I'm gonna join her. I'll be right back, guys. - Oh, it smells good. It smells like barbecue. - I'm very happy. Okay, it's family style. - Do you have ketchup, sir? Thank you. Get back, cat. Go back. Go back by your mama or whoever it is. - Tanya, Tanya, Tanya, Tanya, turn around. - Oh, girl, you have makeup on here. - We didn't get a chance to-- it's NeNe's face. - And how did that go? - And she loves me. - Aww. - It went good. It's a thumbs up. - Tell me about it. - It was needed. Actually, out of the entire time that I have known her, that is the most open with how she feels that she's ever been. It actually feels like a weight is lifted. - I feel like we're having the best trip. We're all getting along, and there's such a good energy. - Somethin' is happening here. We need to have them a part of it. - Girl, this look good. - Is that chicken? - Is that chicken? - So, I was thinking we should have a burn party, right? - This, like, burning man type thing. - But instead, because we are here in Greece, I was thinking we'd do a ruins party so that we don't ruin our friendships, and I feel like it probably will end with a hug. - Oh, I love this. - I know. I just feel like issues are better off on the table than under the table. So, I proposed to ruffle the feathers just a little bit, so we can calm it back down in a real way. - Okay, should we be worried about that black cat? - Oh, there goes-- Huh? - Right there, that black cat that's, like, passing-- - Why is right under Kenya? - Yeah. Is that an omen? - No, it's not. We don't believe in that. By the blood of Jesus, we bind you, black cat. Come on. - Meow. - Look at that cat. Marlo, give me a piece of what that is. - I don't wanna look at that cat. - Here, kitty-kitty- kitty-kitty-kitty. - Oh, y'all got y'all food. Is it good? - It's so good. - This is the best meal we-- - Ahh! Oh! Ahh! - You're scaring the cats. - Now, there's too many cats. - 'Cause NeNe is feeding 'em. - NeNe, why are you throwin' meat? That's why they're comin'. - I have not fed them. Let me give their ass a French fry. Get, go get the French fry. Go. I don't understand the cats. Them things was a mess. Uh-uh. Ooh, now they got Lassie out here. - Uh-uh. - What the hell? - Bitch, what the hell? - Porsha, you've owned many dogs. - Okay, please no with the dog. - Oh, my God. - Oh, gotta go. - Ah, Cynthia, you ain't scared of cats. - I don't like animals around like that. - Okay, we're black. - We don't allow any animals in the kitchen. Ahh! Somethin' touchin' me. Oh, it's my purse. The family pet will be the family pet. Then when it's time to eat, it's like, "Get outta here, dog!" I'm ready to go to my room. - Hey. - Oh, Eva. - Hi. - What's up? - We just wanted to check on ya, right quick. - Where is our baby, Maverick? - Ooh! - Whoa. - Look at her stomach. Update, update. - Ooh, what's the update? - I know. - We miss you. - We miss you. - All right, boo. - Bye, baby Maverick. - See you later. - Bye. - She's gonna have a whole baby tomorrow. - Oh, my gosh. - So, tell me somethin'. Why are the two of you missing lashes? Did y'all cry them lashes off? - Uh-uh. They were in my eye. - That is not how y'all lashes came off. - What? Can we get more lamb chops, please? - Clearly, they made up in their little one-on-one because now they back to callin' each other big sis, little sis. - You guys are askin' NeNe and I about our conversation. I suggest we do one more thing that'll be super fabulous, and this is actually kind of piggybacking off of the spirit of NeNe and I talking. - We'll tell you tonight. - Okay. - I was thinking Tanya and I could host a little event for us. - A soiree. - Yes. I was just wondering if y'all were down with a ruin party. - What's that? - So, if you have anything you wanna get off your heart, we're gonna put it amongst the rest of the ruins, and it is done. It will never be brought up again. - Ahh! Say it again, honey. - Sounds like a host takeover to me. - I live for the host to take over, honey. - I don't understand why Porsha wants us to clear the air publicly when she and NeNe just cleared the air privately. It's a recipe for disaster. - Oh, she mad. - Coming up next... Shut up, bitch, before I you up. - Now you're gonna say you're ----in' me up. - Shut up. - You're gonna try to beat me up. - Shut up, bitch. Shut up. - Please do. - Just stop. - Please assault me with a peanut. - You need to be assaulted. - Shut up, NeNe. You're just a low-life scum. - Shut up. - NeNe. - Stop. - NeNe. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ - I hear girls talkin', but I don't hear wine. - Bitch, that is so cute. - Ain't it cute? - Oh, my, and they're pretty. - It's four bottles of wine, just enough for our event tonight. - And we got rosé to go with it. We got five. - Boom. Oh, look, look, I got a bottle, too. - We got five. Oh, girl, you did it. - Where did you get that? - This is from earlier. - And we have the Grey Goose. - Yeah, this is from earlier. - Bitch, you're gonna have a real party. - This is a party, a house party. - And we need this to decorate the area. - Boom. ♪♪♪ - Okay, ruin party. I love these candles. - You look cute. Yes, dress. - Thank you. - Ooh, hostess with the mostess. That's the space that we are ushering these girls into. - Okay, okay. - M'kay? - I feel like moderator. We will do this. - So, if it goes left, I feel like you got that, too. You have that in you to moderate and just keep peace. - Yes. Oh! - Hi. Welcome, guys.. Pizza.. Pizza. Ahh! - You look so pretty! - Yes, Marlo. - Oh, whoa. Marlo came dressed for the club. - Oh, Cynthia, peek a boo. - So, we got some popcorn in case anybody wants to enjoy it. - Hello, hello. - Hello, hello. - Hello. So, what's up, hostess with the mostess, who has taken over our trip? - We appreciate you lovely hostess. Girl, we have enjoyed this trip, so far. We appreciate y'all letting us give y'all a little break for tonight. Lettin' us kinda piggyback on it, m'kay? Okay, so, tonight, we are putting everything into the ruins. - Oh, God. - And we are going to leave it there. - Oh, my God. - And we are going to never visit again. - This is really about positivity. In the spirit of being queens, everybody gets a crown. - So, if you are speaking, first hold the crown. Whomever you would like to address or just to talk about love or give somethin' negative that y'all can get rid of, you hand it to the individual, okay? - Okay. - Okay, I'm gonna take it. - Oh, that's how we do it. - Oh, great. Here you go. - Go ahead and tell us what you and NeNe talked about then since y'all said y'all was gonna talk. That's not how it works. - What? - All you need to know, is that we're good. Thank you for asking. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Oh I gotta... It's my turn? Y'all both gonna talk. - She wants me to start, so I'm gonna start. - Oh. - Um, NeNe and I definitely had an issue that we ended up takin' public, and it got really, really ugly, and then we both gave up on the friendship. But, today, we had a conversation at the vineyard, and it was a lotta tears. It was a lot of just expressing ourselves to each other, somethin' we hadn't really done, and I'm just happy to have her back in my life. - Aww. - All right. Well, that's good. - After hearing everything that I've heard Porsha say about NeNe, I think she would just be the last person to fall for NeNe's BS. - Anybody else wanna take part? - All right, I'll go. - Oh. - All right. - That actually looks cute. - Goddess queen. - I'd like to give my crown to Miss Kenya Moore Daly. Okay, um, one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about, Kenya, was when we were having the dinner and drinks in the sky, I felt like, initially, we were kinda jokin' around about The Bailey Wine Cellar. In that moment, honestly, I was just there to have a good time, and I was like, "Okay, you know, "I'm just gonna go with it," and I just kind of felt like it just kept going and kept going. And then it just started to feel like, "Okay, is it really a joke, or am I the joke?" - You're never the joke. Honestly, it was just me being silly and having fun. I'm sorry for hurting your feelings. I think your businesses speak for themselves. I'm always gonna applaud you. You're a queen. You're my sister. - Thank you. - And that's not gonna change. So, yeah. - All right, well, that's what I had to say. Thank you. - Good deal, ladies. That is beautiful. - Cynthia will never hold Kenya accountable. - Let's celebrate our queen. I'm sorry. - You're letting supposedly your good friend ruin your engagement, bash your business, and all of that is... "Friends make mistakes." I don't ever recall Cynthia saying friends make mistakes where I was concerned. I just wanna make a comment. I don't really understand the tip-toeing. I know that if that was me, that you would have gone harder. Cynthia is Kenya's punk. Believe that. - Well, I-I know you say that. - We were closer than anybody in this circle, and that includes her, okay? - Right, right. - Well, the things change. - Well, things change because you want 'em to change 'cause you're a big-ass bully, bitch. - Wait a minute, now. - All right. - You just called me a bitch. What-what is this? - What you gonna say about it, though? What you doin' about it? - Oh, my God. - What? What do you want? What? You want me to fight you? What are you talking about? - No, you can't fight me, girl. - What am I gonna do? - You would lose. So, all you can do, is run your mouth. - Hold on. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - You are a negative Betty anyway, girl. - All right, let's-let's move on. - No, this is not part of the rules. - You are the- the most negative. - Negative Betty. - Okay, okay. - Wait, this is not part of the rules. - Okay, hold on. Hold on. - She ain't gonna bully NeNe Leakes, bitch, 'cause she gonna get in that ass. - I don't understand what the problem is between the two of them. ♪ Ahh I'm confused I'm confused ♪ ♪ I'm confused confused confused ♪ - I am done commenting. I don't have nothing else to say. - Okay, but I would like to address NeNe's comment. - You can absolutely make a comment. - Okay. - Would you like the crown for this one? - Yes, thank you. - Are you gonna hand it to someone else? - Yeah, I'm gonna give it to NeNe. - Okay, here you go. - Put it on. - Oh. - Let me adn you. - Thank you, honey. - There you go. - I don't have anything to say, though. You can take it off. - You had plenty to say a minute ago. - I've said all I needed to say. If you don't have a crown, you should be shutting the up. - What's wrong with you? Is this the bipolar NeNe, miss bipolar? - No, you're bipolar, bitch. - Who are you bringing to the table? I'm a bitch now? - There's no one more bipolar in this circle than you. - Oh, I don't think so. Everybody can agree it's you. - You are bipolar. - That's why you had to grovel and ask for-- to be friends with everybody. - Bipolar Kenya, go get your medication. - Give it a break. Give it a break. - Yes, clearly, you have issues. - That's why your husband left, bitch, because you're bipolar. - Oh! - Stop, stop. - Aren't there rules? - Everybody stop! - Go get your medication. That's why your husband left, bitch, because you're bipolar. - Oh! - Stop, stop. - Aren't there rules? - Everybody stop! - Marc is twirling right on out of the marriage, him and his nose ring. Bye, Marc. - I know who NeNe is. She's fake, and she's phony. - Come on, come on, come on. - That's why your husband can't deal wit' you, bitch. - Her sympathy the first night when we were there was all bullsh--. - I've been through a divorce, and I would really want to know if you're okay. - And this is just another example of why I think NeNe is a disgusting person. No, let her be ugly because ugly as you look on the inside and outside. - Attention whore, attention whore, bitch, you wish, bitch. - Stop. - But you can't even blink your eyes. - This is too much. - Bitch, I don't have anything on my eyes, bitch. Just be quiet. - Somebody please help me blink my eyes. Get your dirty, honey. - Too bad your husband don't like you. Your husband-- - And you like yours? You like yours? - Stop! - This is exactly what we did not want to happen. - Let them vent. Let them vent. - Your husband doesn't like you. - Let them vent. It stays here. - I left him, girl, please. - No, he left you, bitch. - Let them get it out. Sh--. - Attention whore, he never liked you. - Shh! - Matter of fact, who's trip is it? Kandi and Kenya, you got the trip back. There you go. - You're tired, and you're dry. - You're tired, and your cat is dry while your husband is gone, bitch. He would've stayed, bitch. Well, I'm sure he don't wanna you, bitch. Can I get a shot? - Yes. - Guys, this is too far! Guys, please! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! - New booty implant, they look wrong. They're wrong. Get a new booty implant. Every time I see her, I'm gonna read her now 'cause you ain't gonna never be able to punk me, Kenya, fake contacts, okay? Blow up booty, okay? Wig, okay? - Let's move on! - I didn't feel like that was resolved. - Okay, who wants to go next? - Yes. - Who you wanna crown? - I'll give it to Tanya. - Come on. It's coming back over here. - So, listen. I wanna say thank you for being able to be, um, compassionate. I know we had our issues, and they, in my mind, were resolved. In your mind, they may not have been, and I just wanted to just thank you for, you know, not bringing up stuff that you obviously know I'm dealing with, right now. - I genuinely appreciate that apology because I feel like we went to, like, some real lows, and people can apologize for pieces of their actions but not for hurting other people's feelings. - Well, I do have to say that I was a little disappointed that I didn't get the same from you because I definitely felt a way about what you did, and you never apologized to me for it. - What'd she do? - She knows what I'm talking about. - With the wig. - Yeah. - I mean, this is me being messy. - Let me see the wig. Ahh, that's that wig! - Oh. - My whole thing is that even if the intent was not there, it still made me feel a certain way. - Mm-hmm. - And you never acknowledged that. I don't think Kenya gives two about Tanya. She's probably more jealous of Tanya's relationship with Paul because she doesn't have a relationship with Marc. - To be honest, like, this is the ugly truth. I didn't feel sorry because we had had this immediate reaction of you bringing this woman in who was, you know, trying to, like, defamation of Paul's character. - Hello. - Oh, it's the cookie lady. - Oh, wonderful. - Have a seat. - That did not match. - And so, just for me, I was like, I don't feel sorry. - It didn't match, Kenya. - And it took me-- - Porsha. - And it didn't match to me because-- - Why do you keep doing that? - So, I apologize for that. I would never attack your business, I-- - You should apologize for that. - I accept that. I accept that. - Yes, that's good. - Now, where I really felt it went too far-- - Cynthia, can I have them popcorn, please? - In the same way you were affected by that because your business is precious to you-- - Listen. - Our houses, our families, our partners, our spouses are the most precious thing we have. - Shh. - Yeah. - Over and above our businesses. Sh-shocked that that was an acceptable thing. - Girl, you have done so many things. Shut up, bitch, before I you up. - Oh, see, now you-- now you're gonna say you're ----in' me up. - Shut up. - You're gonna try to beat me up. - Shut up, bitch. Shut up. - Please do. - Just stop. - Please assault me with a peanut. - You need to be assaulted. - Shut up, NeNe. - Shut up. - You're just a low-life scum. - NeNe. - Stop. - Please assault me. Please go to jail, again. - You're ----in' with me, Kenya. - You're a big-ass that knows it all! - You is a dumbass bitch, and you will get ----ed up. - For more information on "The Real Housewives," ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪
