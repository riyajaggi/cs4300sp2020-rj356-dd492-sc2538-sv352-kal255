Who tries to spit on someone? - I'll spit in your mother----ing face. - This is gutter behavior, pure gutter behavior. - You have to know NeNe. Like, she could not put her hands on here. Like... - What the hell is goin' on? Like, the NeNe I know is not seriously throwing popcorn at this girl and acting like she's gonna spit on her. - Just don't spit on me. - That deserves an ass whippin'. I'm sorry. Like, why is this okay? - Actually, in Greece, it's a good thing to be spit on. We're in Greece. She should want all these popcorn seeds. It's good luck. I'll spit in your mother----ing face, bitch.

We got too much money to do that. - you, bitch. - Bye! - I think we need to just, like, time out. - Even for NeNe, it cannot be any lower. The things that NeNe is sayin' to Kenya is just so disgustingly vulgar. - I just-- I-- listen. I-- - No, Porsha, though, the point-- - I think we should just stop. - Yeah. - It was gonna be-- - Yeah, she started with insulting me. I did not insult her. - Kenya. - I'm just sittin' up here trying to talk our issues. She's the one that goes off the ndle. - I'm like, what is the anger about? - I'm gonna be honest wit' you. Y'all were friends. - Can we give you a group hug at least? - No, bitch. Keep your hugs. - No, but we're gonna give you a group hug. Come on. - I ain't gonna let you go, though. - Where you live, bitch? - You look good. - Kenya, what is goin' on up in here? I've called my realtor, and we're gonna go look at some places, and I also have a helicopter on the roof to take us up outta this camp, okay? - I have love for you. - Mm-hmm. - I always have. - Where did it go? - Porsha. - Was it your baby shower? - Do you want me to talk or not? - I do. I want-- - You wanna keep talkin'. - I want you to answer me. - That's what you gotta do. You gotta listen. - I will listen. What happened? - Okay. The only thing that I have a issue with, is her callin' my baby a buffalo. That is the only thing I have an issue with. - She didn't ca-- okay. - Yes, she did. - Okay, I'm not gonna take up for that. - That-- you-- she's never addressed or apologized for. - And let me tell you somethin'. Let me tell you somethin'. That's the same mother----in' problem I had. That's what I've been holding onto. - She ain't never called your baby nothing. - She called me a big, fat-ass piggy face. - She called you that. She called you that. - What? She called me a pig. - Wait. Can you stay here while I tell her why I'm upset about my event? Are you gonna support me? - I'm going to sit with you and support you. - Did she ever call your baby a buffalo? Did she ever insult-- - She didn't call your ----in' baby a buffalo. - She did. - She called you a buffalo. - No, she didn't. - Hey! - She's gonna have a buffalo, isn't she? - Girl. - I've been just as pissed as you have. I've been just as ----in' pissed as you have. - We were never friends like that. - I've been pissed as you have. - Okay, I'm sorry, Cynthia. I apologize. - NeNe Leakes, I have one issue with her, is you called my baby a buffalo, and you always said kids-- - No, I called you a buffalo. - No, you didn't. You said, "What is she having? "A buffalo?" - I called you a buffalo! I didn't call your baby nothin', honey. - Who does that? - But let me tell you this. If I called you a buffalo, and it hurt you, I apologize 'cause I'd never wanna hurt another woman. - Wait, wait. - Shh-shh-shh. - Wait, she's apologizing. Be quiet. - Quiet! - I never called your baby anything, and I was mad with you, and I apologize to you if you felt that I was talking-- 'cause I don't do that to kids, and you wanna try and use your kid in this situation for sympathy. - No, I'm not gonna try to use my kid. - If it hurt you, I apologize. - She said she apologized, Kenya. - She apologized. - Hold on. Hold on. Hold on! Did you hear? - Kenya. Kenya. - Did you hear? Un-uh. Did you hear? Un-uh! - No. - Did you hear the apology? Because I had to receive the same apology, Kenya. - I'm going to say yes, so you can stop, okay? I get it. - Don't say yes, so I stop. That's passive aggressive. I, too, was called fat, okay? But she apologized, and now we're okay. So, can you hear her a little bit... through the curse words? - My thing is done, Porsha. I have nothing else to say. - I hear-- I heard your apology. - Okay, all right. - Accept my apology, bitch! Can I say something? - We are actually making progress. - I don't wanna talk about it. I'm done. - Because I heard your-- I heard it. I heard it. - Look. - I said all I can say. - Let me say. - Because I get held to a higher standard. - Hold on, people! - We can't have six conversations. - If the-- okay, well, hello. - All right. Come on. Come on. - I'm trying to talk, please! - They don't want us to have six conversations. - Sorry, okay. - Let's just listen. - If we're trying to have a conversation where we are trying to clear the air, she can't keep apologizing for the same thing. - No, she doesn't need to. - But my point is-- - Okay, so, accept it! - Why are you-- If-if you say that's the thing that made you so upset, are you going to accept the apology about Brooklyn or not? We shouldn't have to keep going on about that point. - We're not. It's done. It's done. - Leave it alone. It's done. - I will never revisit it again. - I received an apology from NeNe to Kenya. - And I did. - About a miscommunication of a read, and I feel like you will receive it a little later. This isn't the moment, and that's-- that is okay. - It is. - Everything ain't gotta happen right this moment. - Mm-hmm. Honestly, I would never say anything where her child is concerned, but when you're beep, you know, you just start sayin' all kinda stuff about each other. I didn't even realize I had said that. - So, let's move on. Who would like the crown next? I think-- - Marlo wants it. Marlo wants the crown. - Okay. - Oh, God. - She puttin' her up to talk. - Do we have to keep goin'? - So ridiculous, yeah. - I'm glad that NeNe apologized. It was a horrible thing to say, and just because Kenya accepts that apology doesn't mean they have to be best of friends, but at least, you know, they can move on. - Say what you're gonna say, Marlo. Get it off your chest. - You can give it to Kenya. - Yeah, I'm-I'm kinda, like, done with this. - Whoever you are get-- giving the crown to, it doesn't have to be a negative thing. It could just be something that will make your relationship better. - And it's not negative. I just wanna speak to how I feel. - So that you don't ruin what you have. So, Marlo would like me to please put this upon your beautiful locks. Thank you, Kenya. Thank you, Marlo. - I just feel that what you did to my event, my hair event, was-- it deserves an apology. ♪ Kenya Moore Haircare ♪ - What the hell is this? - Hi! I-I just-- - So, there's nothing you feel you have to say to me. - I-I-I feel I have to say a lot. So, if you don't remember the things you say and do to me, I don't know where to go from there, but you do. You are an aggressor toward me. You always have been since we fell out. You wanna bring a gun to shoot me, I'm gonna come back with a machine gun, and that's what I did. Certain things are off-limits-- my relationship with my mother, my daughter, my husband. - If a person's mother don't wanna be bothered with them, you know somethin' is up. - All right. - Marlo, just shut up. Nobody wanna hear this disgusting sh--. So, you wanna sit here, and you want an apology now because I came in after you completely tried to destroy me the way other people in my family have. Then fine, Marlo. I'm sorry. Then I'm sorry. - But, Kenya, see, right-- - No, no! I need the whole sideline to be quiet 'cause, right now, I'm gonna speak to you for real. I know you're good at acting, and I knew, at some point-- - Now, see, now you want-- now, see, what I'm saying. - No, 'cause I'm speaking from my heart, right now. - So, what was acting? When yo- when you told me-- - I'm speaking on my nephews. - It's her turn, ain't it, Por-- Marlo-- Porsha? - Let me talk. I didn't talk when you talked. - It's her turn. - Do I look like I'm acting th you? - You do great. - Kenya, let her speak. - Let her finish. - Kenya, hear her out. - Let her speak. - But, right now, you are amazing. - Okay, let-- - But what I'm gonna say, and I don't-- - Okay, I'm done. I'm done. - I don't need-- I don't need any backup. - Stop, Kenya. It's not-- - I don't need anyone to say-- and do what you do best. - Kenya! Kenya! - You can't just say your part and not let her say hers. - She just keeps insulting me. - She's not finished. Sit down. - She keeps insulting me. I'm tired. - Kenya, you're the queen of saying you can deal with anything. - I'm done! I'm tired! - Come back! - Bye. - Stop being the person that walks away! What are you doing? Stop it! Kenya! - At the end of the day, I'm gonna tell y'all the things I said about her mom were ----ing awful. I apologize for it. It was wrong. - Kenya, you can't just say what you wanna say and then leave. - But you can-- but I told you don't insult me. That's my point. - NeNe been insulting you all night and you still sat there... - And that's why-- no, because she was leaving. - And so, the one thing, her saying, "Oh, you're a great actress," that turned you all o? I didn't even wanna do this. Like, I knew this was not the time. I get it. I get it, Kenya. Kenya is dealing with so much stuff at home. Like, she really doesn't even have the fight in her, right now. - The next time you want a dessert, honey, go to a bakery, baby, because I bring you dessert every time I see you, honey. - Come on, give me a hug. Give me a hug. - Don't forget your crowns, ladies! - Coming up next... Everybody in this group has gotten over things way worse than what y'all gotten over. - I've never had a child, and I've never had a husband, and she used it against me. - I get you, but nobody has ever accused you of rape. ♪♪♪ - Ugh! - How are you? - Hi. ♪♪♪ - I think I saw a diamond Bible next to your table. Oh, you did. Yeah, I don't leave home without it, especially with this group of girls. - Mm-hmm. - Lord, you gotta have a Bible. - Good morning. - Hey. - You look beautiful. - Ugh. - How are you this mornin'? - Wrecked, girl, oh, my gosh. - I can't. Tanya, let me tell ya. I woke up. I sat in front of the mirror like this for, like, five minutes. And I was like, I can't even put on Chapstick. - I really believed in our intention and what we were trying to do because we had had this great couple of days, and I thought we were ready to come to a place where we could put stuff out on the table. - Right. - And it just went, pshew. - Well, I mean, damn, I think I underestimated how upset NeNe and Kenya were. - Yes. - It literally went from zero to 1,000. - All we really do. Hi, dolls. - Oh, my God, now. - Yes, honey. - Come on through. Come on. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Look, NeNe, there's the crown drowned at the bottom of the pool. - Baby, none of that worked last night. That did not work at all. - It-it got outta hand. I seen Brooklyn and the kids. I was gonna hold her and bring her out here. Then I thought Kenya might shoot me. I was like, let me leave the baby in there. - Did you get any sleep last night? - Girl, I'm exhausted. I went to my room, and I was reading my script. - You actually had to study after you went in there? - Well, I wanted to make sure that I at least read over everything. Heller. - Heeey! What do you have? Hello. - I wanna have a conversation with you without getting beat up today. Oh, really? - I can't find my flip flops. - I'm missin' one of my mine. - Man, we need to search the bus, again. We need our little shoes to walk around in. - Girl. - My feet are ashy enough. - You can't shade your own self, honey. Well, what are we up to today, you guys? - Well, last night definitely took away from the fun and positivity of this trip. - Yeah. - To say the least. - We can blame Porsha and Tanya for that, too. Oh, my God. - I plan to take control back today. - But what did you get out of it wit' you and her? Did you feel like y'all had closure? Here's the thing. - 'Cause I think y'all stopped talking or somethin'. Then y'all got interrupted? - We got interrupted. - Okay. - So, we never got to the place where she could acknowledge, oh, you know-- - Yes, y'all did. She didn't want to. - She did. - Is anybody ever able to interrupt Kenya? No. - That's my point. - If it gets interrupted, she has decided to not answer your ass. - And then she leave. - And then she's gone. - We had a good conversation. I felt like we were the only ones that really had that fair opportunity. - I'm sorry for hurting your feelings. I think your businesses speak for themselves. - Thank you. Thank God we went first. - We were the only ones that have level heads. - To her point, everything else was pretty much a sh-- show with lots of popcorn. - My thing with Cynthia is, is, girl, if you weren't gonna tell her what the real issue is, then you shouldn't even have brought it up at all. - That's right. - Because the real issue was not that she was just teasing you, sweetie. - She's kind of a bit of a hypocrite. - No, that is where she needed to draw the line in the friendship. - Yeah, she does. - Yes. - And let her know this is what you don't do. If you claim you wanna help me and make my business a conversation, don't do it like that. - Right. - If your pet peeve is, don't talk about my business, then you should also really, really try hard to not hate on anybody else's business. This just from the outside lookin' in, baby, 'cause you're not gonna come down on Go Naked Hair. - They let her get away with pure murder. - Why do they do that? - I don't know. 'cause her hips are fake. - It's like, girl, you're 52 years old. You have to find a better way to communicate. - You can't do that. - This is Europe. This is not, uh, America. It-it'd be real interesting to see how she gets herself outta jail. - Locked up abroad. - Well, I don't think she's gonna-- - Yeah, locked up abroad. I don't wanna do it. - I don't think she's gonna do that. It's just exhausting to be anywhere near the fire-breating dragon. I hope for actually no interaction with her for the rest of the trip. - I feel that the first night we were here, NeNe genuinely was trying to show you kindness. - I've been through a divorce, and I would really want to know if you're okay. - And I say, that's bullsh--. How can you say she was being genuine, and the first chance she gets to try to hurt me when I'm at my lowest point? - Bipolar Kenya! - Let-- give it a break. - Yes. - That's why your husband left, bitch, because you're bipolar. - Whoa! - I get what you're sayin', but is she's gonna sit there and give a whole speech about how she wanted to know how you were feeling and da-da-da-da-da? - Did she call me? - Listen, that was at the table face-to-face. - Oh, oh, okay, she wanted to know, but she didn't reach out. - But even this week, she was trying to have a conversation with you before she had a conversation with Porsha. - This is the thing, She says one thing, and she holds herself to completely different rules. - When she brought up the buffalo comment, I'm like, okay, now that's-that's a reach. - She know damn well. - I was like, that was a reach. - It was a real reach. - That was a reach, girl, even though you-- - You had to understand you're trippin'. - Even though you're trippin', that's a reach. - A you apologized. - Yes. - Like, you apologized flat out. That was not what it was. - I said, "You thought that?" Then that's ----ed up. 'Cause I-I ain't talkin' about your baby. I'm talkin' about you, bitch. - Yeah. - Honestly, I think that first night was the key. Should've tied them bitches down. Because now Kenya is gonna rest upon some of the insults from last night to still be mad. - Okay, all right. If-if-if it is possible for the four of us to sit down-- - The answer is never. - Everybody in this group has gotten over things way worse than what y'all has gotten over, and I can say-- - No, that's not true. - Oh, for sure, I can say myself. - No, I've never had a child, and I've never had a husband, and she used it against me. - I get you, but nobody's ever accused you of rape. I know. - You and your husband... - I'm telling you what I know. - ...had planned on drugging me and Shamea and taking me back to your house. - You a damn liar! So, if I can still be cool and have a conversation after that sh--. I don't wanna make myself uncomfortable because of someone else. So it forced me to get over things with Porsha. And one thing is for sure. We need to try to get NeNe and Kenya on the same page, so that they won't suck the life out of this trip. I get that last night was ugly and, uh, all that type of stuff, but... that. I don't care that y'all mad. We gonna have fun today. - I'm ready to have fun. - Well, you know I got to be friends with Dina Lohan when I was in the "Big Brother" house. But Lindsay has a club here. - Oh, yes! - So, it's like a beach club. So I want us to go by there. - Yes, Kandi. Get this show back on the road, okay? We've fallen off in the Grecian Sea somewhere. - I wanna do some fun team building type fun games, and I want everybody to participate. Don't give me that look. - I am giving you that look. Don't do it. - Let me tell you, I took abuse from you last night. - What did I do? - When I tried to follow you ever here, you was like... I tried to give you a hug, and you hit me. Come on, give me a hug. I did not hit you. - Yes, you did. You was like-- literally like-- - I did not hit-- Oh, my God. - Yes, you did. I can't believe she did that! - That was so hard. - But I was like, okay. - I'm bruised. I need some ice. - Girl, whatever. - Is it red? - It's swellin' up. - I did not hit you that hard. Coming up next... Three, two, one, go. Ah! ♪♪♪ - Does anybody wanna go to the beach today? - Yes, let's go. - It's our last day. - Ladies, y'all ready? I love that. - All right, come on. - Look at that cat. He's standing right there lookin' at you. - Yeah. - Y'all wore y'all self out last night. - Y'all wore me out. - Girl, you sat there and talked to us all damn night. - Do you know, by the time I went downstairs, it was 4:44? - It is not my fault. - Trying to keep y'all in order, and I do know it's all Kenya's fault. - Ooh! - Let me see. - Listen, I'm a water sign, okay? I'm a Cancer. All this craziness on the land, it's just too much. Like, I am actually ruined from the ruins party. - Hostesses, what we-what we doin' when we get here? Queen Kandi? - Hmm? - She asleep? - Yeah, she sleeps good sittin' up. - I know somethin' about some game. Some kinda team building. - Sh--. 100-year-old women ain't team built by now, they ain't gonna be team built. - Team building time. - Lohan Seaside. This is cute. - This is amazing. - Welcome to Lohan Seaside, guys. - We are excited to be here. - I think you're familiar with Lindsay. - Yes. - Of course. - I'm gonna show you the place. - Of course. - Sure. - Let me guide you. - Oh, wow, this is gorgeous. - Beautiful! - So, we've set up the things that you requested, guys. - This is adorable. - These are the games that I had set up. - And whatever you need, I'm always here for you. - Thank you. - Have fun. - Okay, ladies. So, I have decided to take back control of my trip. - Thank God! - Okay, y'all could've done me better than that. Thank you, Porsha. - So, I wanted to do a fun game to teach you how to listen. - Ooh, not teach, honey. - I wanna mix things up a tad. - Uh-oh. - I decided that I would like to put Kenya... - Uh-huh. - ... and Tanya together. - Okay. Okay. - I loved what happened with you, NeNe, and Porsha yesterday. - Mm-hmm. - So, that leaves Cynthia and Marlo. - Wait, you said it was a listening game? I wasn't really lookin' for Marlo to be my partner, especially after our little episode in Toronto. - Marlo! However... mama wants to win at any cost. - Who you gonna be with? - I am the judge. - Oh! - Oh, she's taking your role today. - One thing that I know is that the girls always get along when we're competitive. - Welcome to "Bitch Stole My Talent!" Yeah! - Get 'em! Get 'em! - No! Ahh! These little team building exercises are really meant so that people who weren't getting along the greatest can work together to try to win. And just as a safety precaution, I decided there will be no ball throwing. One of you is gonna guide your partner, and one of you is gonna be blindfolded and do the walking. - Who is the best listener between us? - Me. - You are? - You be talker. - I'm the talker. - Neither one of us. We talk over each other. That's the magic, girl. We don't even hear what each other say. We just smile and giggle. - I am definitely the better listener. Porsha is long-winded. Baby, she can talk for a whole 45 minutes. And then you be like, girl, can I get one word in? - Do you-- - Bah! Ha! I heard you. - There's the blindfold on each table. - Okay. - So, basically, you have to guide your partner around the obstacle course. - Okay. - So, the first thing, you have to tell them how to get around the chair. Then they have to step on their disc, then go around, sit on the chair. Then they have to step on the other disc, and then give you hand five. Y'all ready to get in your places? Yes. - All right. - Cynthia? - Yeah. - Trust issues. Don't lead me wrong. - I know. I know. - Don't have me miss that seat, either, Cynthia. - All right. Listen to me then. If you listen to me, darling, you will get the seat. - I'm gonna listen. - Ready, set, go! - Okay, come on, Kenya. Come to your left. Come, come, come, come. Keep going. Straight, straight, straight. Come on. Come on, girl. Right through the arrows. That's it. That's it. - Left-- uh, right touch. Right touch. - Okay, walk, Marlo. Walk straight, Marlo. Over, over, over. Come on. Sit down, sit down, sit down! - Come on. Sit on the chair. Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. - Left foot, right here, left foot. - Now, come on, come on, come on. - High five, high five. - Yes! - Tanya and Kenya won. - Yay! - Oh, Lord. - What'd they do? - No, no, no. They-they beat us already. - Who? - Marlo, like, sucks at taking direction. I almost need to, like, wave, like, some money or a Birkin bag in front of her to get her to gravitate toward me. - Switch places wit' your partner. - You ready? Okay, Porsha, hold on. - Blindfold, Miss Bailey. - You're goin' down. - Oh, I'm so ready for this! - Ready... - Porsha, listen! - ...set, go! - Move left. Porsha, no, no! Porsha! - To your right. Sit. To your right. Yeah, sit, sit, sit, sit! Okay. - Touch the disc. Touch it, touch it. Porsha, touch it wit' your right-- yeah, yeah, yeah. - Forward, forward. No, stop, Cynthia. Sh--. - Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. Oh, come on, sit. Okay, now, turn around. Turn around. Turn around. Turn around. We won! We won! - Come to your left. To your left. - To my left? - No, come up forward. - Marlo and I pretty much suck together. - Sit down. We won! We won! Wait. Marlo, you did it on purpose! I followed your directions! - NeNe and Porsha got that one. - Yeah! - We got that one. Yeah! - We did that. Uh-oh, titty, titty, titty! This would not be a proper girls' trip if NeNe's titty was not on the loose. - Team Tanya and Kenya have a point. - We're called the Gods. - Team NeNe and Porsha have a point. - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - And Team Marlo and Cynthia have zero points. - Zero points. - Zero! - Do we get another chance? - No, boo. - Coming up next... - Kenya, 'cause you were one of our muses, and so are you, NeNe Leakes, we are going to be you, and we're gonna have a conversation. Oh! ♪♪♪ - I have another fun game. I wanna make an example. Come here, Tanya. - Okay. - Come here. - I'm the best partner you could have. - So, this is what we're doin'. Back to back. Back to back. - Oh, girl, I don't know about this. - Back to back. Back to back. - Back to back. - Oh, I thought she said, "Hop on my back." - No, back to back. - Girl. - I don't think we're gonna be able to fit each other. - Hop on your back? - All right, come on. We gonna squat. Get this cup. - Oh, God. - Then we gotta go to the ocean. - Go to the ocean? - We gotta dip-dip. Fill it up with water. And then we gonna come back. - Wit' your eyes open? - Yeah, with your eyes open. - You gotta fill up the bucket. - Oh, Cynthia, I'm gonna drag your ass. - And we are gonna fill up our bucket 'til we get to the black line. - Oh, wow! - The first one that fills it to their black line wins. Everybody line up right here. You gotta be connected the entire time. Okay. - Come on. Let's go! - Five, four, three, two, one, go. ♪♪♪ Whoa! - Ah! Move to the side, to the side. - Porsha's a lot stronger than I thought she was. I mean, she is dragging NeNe, and I know that is not a light load. Emotionally or physically. - Get it. Get it. - I'm good, Porsha. I'm good. - Hold hands together. Hold hands. - Okay, gotta hold. Okay. - Ah! - Oh, my knees locked. - Wait, Porsha, Wait. - Y'all about to drop all y'all water out your bucket. - No, no, no, we got this. Okay. - Wait, let me guide you. Let me guide you. Come on. Come on. - Y'all about to be disqualified. Y'all better get connected. - Okay, come on, Porsha. Connect, connect. Turn around and connect. - Bring your ass up. Bring your ass up. - Ahh! - Whoa! Ah! We're gonna win. - Okay, go. Porsha. - Uh, y'all gave up? - We gave up. - You're disqualified. - It ain't workin'. - What are y'all doin'? Titties is out. Let me put you together, child. She's been waitin' to drag my ass. - Look at these mother----ers. - Okay, okay. - What are you doing? Y'all not going again? - We couldn't get back up from the squat. I told you, the squat is deadly. - Get away from us! Okay. Stop, Porsha! Pour it. - You're always ----in' stuff up. - After all these little games, I hope everybody's spirits stay on the up and up. - Thank you. - Because tonight, Kenya and I have plans for this goddess party. I don't know if everybody has everything that they need for the Greek goddess evening, but we're going shopping. - Where are the dresses at? - Does this fit me? - With your nice boobs. - That's pretty. - I hope everybody comes looking good in their best goddess outfit, and I pray that the girls go lighter on the alcohol tonight. - Oh! ♪♪♪ - Kandi? - Come in. - Hi. - Look at you. Don't you look gorgeous? Such a goddess. - Well, honey, the goddess of cheekbones. - Oh, yes, yes. Okay, goddess of cheekbones. - Oh, my God, you look amazing. - Well, thank you. I had to throw this together 'cause, girl, I waited too long. - Throw it together? - I waited 'til the last minute to figure out what I was gonna wear, so I just pulled out any ol' dress in my closet that looked like it could be Grecian. - Girl, how you gonna wait 'til the last minute? It's your damn trip. - I know. It was just so much goin' on. If you're going to Greece, you should definitely have a goddess party. I mean, that's what the Greeks were known for. Mythology, heller. Anyway... So, this trip has just been so hard to get NeNe and Kenya on the same page. - I know. - And, you know, since I just announced my role in the show "The Chi." - Yes, you did. Congratulations. - And you are a thespian yourself. - Oh, thank you for noticing. - Okay. - Oh, what go on? Good morning, Miss Kenya. This Moore Haircare, what will it do for this? - Exactly. So, why don't we play out a Greek tragedy? Oh, sh--. - You know, like the play. - Stop, not a Greek tragedy. - Yes, but you can be NeNe. I'll be Kenya. - Okay, you know NeNe and I just got back cool now. - No. - What-what are gettin' ready to do? - It could be fun, but we'll be them. - Right, okay. - If we can make them laugh-- - I've had quite a bit of drama on the Greece trip already. So, the fact that Kandi has hand chosen me to be a part of this Greek tragedy has me thinking this could go really right or really wrong. - But we're gonna have to let each other talk, though. - Right. - So, it's like, we gotta be them but not be them. - Right. - Because, you know, they won't let each other get a word out. - Right. - This little performance should give Kenya and NeNe perspective to say, "Okay, well, maybe our issues aren't that deep." And if nothing else, at least it gives me some acting practice for "The Chi." So, then we're gonna do "but," 'cause, you know, she does that. - I know. She does do her hand like that. - She does this all the time. - I can't even believe your hand bends like that. Her hand does that. - I'm double jointed, so it's easy for me to do it. - That's, like, her favorite thing, especially when she's mad. Okay. - And then you could be like, "Look, honey." You know how-- do your NeNe thing. - Uh-huh, like a NeNe-ism. - And, like, and then we can go back and forth about, like, you could be sayin', "Look, honey, I've been tryin' to talk to you. "I don't really know what your problem is." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - Right. - And then you can say, you know, "'Cause everything was just fine as far as I knew when we left from the, um, reunion." - Mm-hmm. What is your issue? I'm not gonna be-- - You know what my issue is. I called you twice, and you never returned my call. - Girl, I was busy. I had just found my husband had cancer. - You don't know to respect people. Oh, girl, not the cancer. Now, that was sensitive. - I didn't have time. - You don't care about anybody but you. I think we're talkin' too loud. - I know. - I think we get a little too excited playing them. I know. It is fun playing NeNe. - But I think you need to make sure you get out more of her points. - Okay. - Because then she gonna feel like we only sticking up for Kenya. - I can get into her points. All right. - Okay. So, I think this is a good start. - Yeah. Oh, my God, I can't believe we're doing this. We gotta get some good laughs. - Well, I'm gonna go downstairs. I think I need a drink now just so I can get in character because, you know, Miss NeNe loves her drink, honey. - Ahh. Coming up next... I'm going in the house. Listen, don't with me now, for real. I'm not doing this. I'm getting ready to leave and go to the bathroom, and I might flush myself down the toilet. Bye. Uh-uh-uh-uh. Don't play games with me. ♪♪♪ - Ooh, that looks interesting. ♪♪♪ Go. Go, go, go. Get away, get away, get away. Oh, my goodness, these cats are the worst. Go! You are not our guest. Hi. - Girl, I can't take the aluminum foil off because the cats is waitin' for the food. Go. - Oh, no. - And then they're not even scared. They're just like, so what? - You look beautiful. Muah, muah. - Muah. Ooh. I love this. - You do? - You are giving us real goddess vibes. - Ooh, la-la. - Hello. - Hello, goddesses. - Hey, goddesses. Hello. - Y'all look gorgeous. - Yes, okay, are you twirling? Okay. - How are you guys? How are you? - Y'all wanna make a drink or somethin'? - Yes. - Yes, of course. - Is this sangria? - Yes. - It is. Okay, great. Okay. Hi. - Hi. - Hello, ladies. - You guys look amazing. - Hello, ladies. - Goddesses. - Oh, our goddesses are here. - Yes. - Y'all look gorgeous. - Everybody looks gorgeous. - Hey. - Let me have some wine. - Let me make a little drink, as well. - I got the drink. Yeah, I'm the bartender. - So, who cooked? - Well-- The restaurant. - Okay, you suck as a bartender just to let you know. - I am great as a bartender, bitch. - Oh, my God, this is disgusting. Oh, wait. Do you have napkins? - So, Kenya, did you ever come up with the Greek goddess names you wanted to give out or no? - Well, maybe we can just ask 'em who they are. - Okay. - A goddess party is, we're just dressed up like goddesses. We'll have names, have some beautiful Grecian wine, and just enjoy the last night that we have together because when I get home, I have a lot to deal with. - We actually had assigned people names based on your personality, but then we were like, well, we don't wanna insult people. - So, we're gonna let everybody pick their own goddess. - Yes. - Okay. - I-I wanna be Aphrodite. I'm the goddess of-- - Fertility, love, and beauty. - Love and beauty. I am Aphrodite... love, beauty, passion. - Who's the goddess of what? - So, Kandi, which one are you? - I was Tyche, goddess of fortune and prosperity. Athena, I think that, um-- - No, I'm Athena. I already chose it. Remember? - Oh, you did? - Yeah. - Oh, okay, my bad. - I'm Athena. - The Greek goddess of wisdom. - Girl, if you had any wisdom, you woulda made up with me a long time ago, honey. - Kenya, Athena is also the goddess of war. - The goddess of war? - The goddess of war. - Ooh, I know she loves to read. - And I am the-the goddess of Eos, which is health and curing diseases 'cause I believe that without health, you can have none of the things that you guys are speaking of. - NeNe is pretty much more like Medusa. - Artemis is the Greek goddess of the hunt. That's you. Wait, the-the hunt? I'm hunting? - You huntin', right now, girl. - I'm not huntin'. I just know what I'm not gonna settle for. - I like Hebe. - Hebe? - Yes. - Oh, goddess of youth? - Goddess of youth and prime of life. - Hera, Greek goddess of marriage. - Oh, I wanna be that goddess. Hello. Somebody is getting married. Who's thirsty now? Not Hera. ♪♪♪ - Cynthia, the cat is right there. - Oh, my God, the cat is up on the table. - Ahh! Get out! Get out! Get out! - Oh! - Oh, no! - Oh, it's up there with the food. - We need to cover the food. - Yes. - He didn't touch it, though. - I wouldn't eat none of that, chile. He done been up there eatin' everything. - He was gettin' ready to pounce. I am over these cats. Like, what is this about? - Now, I have a great big, fat Hello Kitty myself, but... - Ooh, this house got more pussy than a brothel. - Um, I wanted to do something fun. - Again? - Yes. More games. - It's not a game. It's not a game, and it's in the theme of Greece. Clearly, you know, I already told you guys that, you know, I, um, got the role, and I'm super excited, on "The Chi." - You did. - And in Greece, in ancient times, they used to do Greek theater. - Theater. - And so, right now, um, Cynthia and I would like to perform a Greek tragedy. Ooh. Amazing. - Yeah, I do have a Greek tragedy. The tragedy is being on this trip to Greece with Kenya. That is the tragedy, honey. - Kenya. - Yes, ma'am. - 'Cause you were one of our muses-- - Thank you. Oh, Lord. - And so are you, NeNe Leakes, um, because we know that, um, you guys don't wanna have any conversations, and that's fine. We are going to be you and we're gonna have a conversation. Oh! ♪♪♪ - We are going to be you, and we're gonna have a conversation. Oh! - I don't know. I feel like, uh, Kandi, this might not be the best idea, girl. Uh, no. Abort mission. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I-I want you to be, when speaking, speak correctly. I have tried to have many conversations. But now go on. Correction, Kenya's lap dogs, I've tried to talk to your master several times, okay? She just didn't want to receive it because it's coming from me. - Actually, I will be playing the role of NeNe Leakes. - Bring the heat, baby. Get the award. Emmys, honey, all day. - And I'm going to be Kenya Moore. Well, you know, I am an actress. So, I am taking this role as Kenya Moore very seriously. - I'm only givin' a dramatization of what, uh-- - Okay, I gotta record this. - We think is goin' on. - This is gonna be a whole movie. - Oh, a chair? - Where are my-- where is my cocktail, somebody? - I know. - I gotta go pee, too. - We need a refill. - And I gotta go pee. Where my phone at? - You can't go pee now. - Yes, I can. I ain't got time to listen to this bullsh--. - No, stop. No, but let make sure they get it right, now. - I don't give a damn. They can get it wrong. - Okay, so, you're sayin' that-- - Cocktails are encouraged at this point. - And, um-- - Wait, one second. - Hold on one second. - NeNe has to use the restroom. - Oh. - No, they can keep the dramatization going. I don't have to be here for that. - You have to be here. - This is, like, one of the biggest roles of my life. Oh, get it, girl. - Let me mind my business. I'm going to the bathroom. Listen, who the you think you are? Like, you ain't fittin' to guard me and tell me what to do. - I'm asking. I'm going in the house. Listen, don't with me now, for real. I'm not doing this. I'm getting ready to leave and go to the bathroom, and I might flush myself down the toilet. Bye. - What is happening here? It's not gonna be funny if-- - She probably did a Kenya. Disappeared. - Oh, my God. We can't start yet. We have to wait for her. She's coming back. - I wasn't trying to make anybody upset and wanna leave. - Not at all. It was-- - Is she upset? - Listen, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. - Hey, just calm down. - Don't play games with me. - Did she seem upset to you, Marlo? - Was she upset? - I think NeNe left because she's terrified to see herself and the monster that she has been to me this entire trip. I would be afraid to see myself, too. - She just said, "I have to use the restroom." - Oh. - Oh, okay. - Okay, was she number one, two, or three? - Maybe two with this food. - Y'all know what number one and number two is. Number three is, that bathroom is in Atlanta, honey. Any time NeNe is uncomfortable, and I get to see the back of her head, that's it. You ain't gonna see her no more. - Oh, God. - Why you goin'? NeNe! Girl, if you hit my window, I will you up. - NeNe is gone. She has left the building. - I'm just gonna check on the baby. - This may happen. - Not a bad thing. - Back home. - At a later time. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - But in the spirit of love, and light, and Greece, we're going to be ending the evening early. - I want my money back. Do you know how much I paid for this VIP ticket? - The fact that NeNe just left was crazy because I was going to only represent her in the best light possible. - I'm going to my room, and I'm getting ready to pack to go home. I don't have time for the playing the game. - Shh. It's okay. Night-night. Shh-shh-shh. - Wait, how do you say "goodbye" in Greek? - We don't know. - Well done. - Thank you. I tried. I mean, that's so ridiculous. Come on. Like, is it that serious? I just think that they need time to see how really tragic their situation is. - No, you did a good job and thank you so much. - You did a great job. - I'm gonna go pack. Muah. - Even though you couldn't-- - I tried to assist. - Muah. I wanna go home. I have had it wit' you heifers. - Bye. - Good night, Marlo. - Good night. Okay. Next time, on "The Real Housewives of Atlanta"... - It's just a lot of things I felt like I was in the dark about. I just don't know how to even make the visitation work. Yes, he can see her whenever he comes here. - Yeah. And what about when he comes here? Is he gonna stay here? Where is he gonna be? - Oh, no, I don't want him to stay here. - And guess what. - Look at this! - NeNe came to one of my events! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - She made the effort. - Well, I did my sex scene. - How was it? - It was a lotta grinding and flipping each other over. - What'd Todd say? - Todd is not happy. You don't wanna talk to mommy? - I do. - Okay, so, let's talk to mommy. - Aww, you're crying. Aww.
