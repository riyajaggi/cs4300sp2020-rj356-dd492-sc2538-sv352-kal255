 who you would want to have as your trustee? - I think he would have a hard time if it goes against what he really thinks. Um, I don't know why-- - I saw NeNe, uh, by the way. - Oh, really? - So, what was the conversation about? - Somebody that y'all have as a mutual friend recorded you. - She can keep her recordings and stick 'em up her ass. - I'm just letting you know. - Unfortunately, because of Marlo's character, honey, I can't just eliminate her from the list, you know? - Yes.

 This recording Hunni. - Through all the hurt and the pain, I've realized I do want my family. - I hope we can get to a place where she can give me another chance. - Honestly, I do not know how long it's gonna take me to forgive Dennis.

The love just radiates off of you guys all the time, and I definitely would not wanna get married unless it's something like what you guys have.

No. No, no, no. - You gettin' ready for your trip? - Yes. My stylist will be here later tonight to bring me some stuff to wear. From what I hear, up there, you don't really wear clothes. So-- - What you mean? - See, now I know exactly what I wanna do, and I know exactly what we have to do. We gotta get it right. We have work to do. So, no, the cookie jar is definitely closed.

Like, this means we are a family. - I sent you a whole video of our entire engagement. You didn't even look at that. You deleted it. - Why you send that to me, though?

How are you? - Good. - Can you guys do a tuna melt? - Yes, ma'am. - With avocado on it, please, and a iced coffee. Thank you. - All right, got your delicious tuna melt here. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Enjoy. - That looks great. - Let me know if I can get you anything else, okay? - Okay, thank you so much. - Thank you. Mm-hmm. - Hey. - Hey, booby. - Hi. Gettin' them nails done? You know my man's in town, so, you know, I'm going the little extra mile, honey. And, uh-- I know, right? We're lookin' so forward to seeing you guys but-- I'm just meeting Marlo really quickly because I need to kinda get some clarification with Snakegate. You know what I mean? That's true. That's true. All right, well, I'll keep you posted. Thank you, boo. All right, bye. I don't know if I can trust Marlo. Marlo's a suspect, at this point, because she's one of the closest people to NeNe that I'm around. I'm not saying that Marlo is the snake. I'm just saying that I just wouldn't be super surprised if it was her. Just sayin'. - Bailey. - Hi. - Hi, beautiful. Oh, my God, you look so gorgeous. - Hey. Muah. You look great, too. - Oh, I've never been in this area across from the zoo. - Really? - Yeah. - You've never been in the Grant Park area? - Never. - This is where my-- actually, this is the same area where-- - The Bailey Agency, right. - No, the Bailey Wine Cellar. - Oh, okay. - I know it's a lot to keep up with. - You okay sittin' out here eating? - Uh, I am. Why? You don't want to sit out here? - No, it's all right. I just don't-- I don't know. I don't wanna sweat. No, I'm just joking. - Okay. Well, okay. - It's cute, a little breeze. - Do you wanna get somethin' to eat? I started without you. - I just want some water. - So, how has everything been going with you since your event? Your event was amazing. Congratulations, again. - Um, it was except besides your friend interrupting it. - Kenya Moore Haircare! - What the hell is this? - Yeah, Kenya did make an entrance, but you invited her. So, she came. - That was just disrespectful. It was distasteful. It was really me launching my business. - Mm-hmm. Right. - You know, I just felt like who would just do that? - You know what? My relationship with Kenya is-is what it is. - Is different-- very different. - And you guys don't-- - Are y'all lovers? You said it's very different. I'm like, are y'all lovers? - No, no, no. Like, you guys, like I said, like, you say I never see you get NeNe together in front of us, but you say you do it all the time behind the scenes. So-- - Yeah, but you ever let NeNe tell me to be quiet and hush in my house. I bet you gonna see it. - No, no, said said, let me finish. - When Cynthia came to me and said, "You know what?" - And I told y'all we had moved that situation. - Let-- why are you interrupting me? - I'm talking. - Oh,! - Well, I'm just telling you we have moved on past that situation. - Well, but you're interjecting when I'm making a point. - She's like a sister to me. We go back and forth, and that's just our way, and I know it's looks crazy. - And that's like you and NeNe, that's all-- - But, at the end of the day, Kenya know what time it is. - Okay. - I ain't got no problem gettin' Kenya together. - Well, thank God 'cause don't want you to be in a relationship where you're gettin' punked. I will-- I will intervene. - Oh, oh, I'm not-- - I will save you. - Honey-honey, you ain't got to worry about it. - I do ot want you i that, okay? - You-you can lay your wig on- on your end table every night, and not worry about that, honey, 'cause I'm good. - Please, but I'm just sayin' I'm here. I get bothered. Sometime I feel-- you know how we've come so far in our friendship? - Have we? - I think we have. - Oh, okay, 'cause I was actually-- that was one of the reasons why I invited you to lunch. Kandi told me that NeNe told her that she had a recording that a mutual friend of ours recorded of me talking sh-- about her. - Mm-hmm. I heard about that. - Do you know who did it? - That's what I wanna know, too. - Just answer the question. Did you do the recording? I mean, are you recording me, now? - Just answer the question. - Just answer the question. Did you do the recording? I mean, are you recording me, now? - I-- you definitely ain't sayin' nothin' I wanna record. - Yovanna said that she didn't do it. - Were you the one that recorded Cynthia? - Who said I recorded Cynthia? - Cynthia. - Well, I just-- I have to ask. They said it was a mutual friend. - Girl, you got a tear about to come into my damn eye. - And, uh, do not. - No, I'm so for real to think I'm gonna record you. That's just awful to do. - I think it's-- - I would-- that's awful. - Well, I call it Snakegate because I feel like only a snake would do that. - When have you and I been together that I could record you? Only in New York, and it was loud. - Right-right off the top of my head, I-I can't say, but I immediately thought of you, though. - Then, secondly, I wanna ask you-- when you have talked bad to me about NeNe? - I don't reay think I talk bad to you about NeNe. - Exactly. So, how would you say Marlo? I would never record anyone, not-- it ain't that serious. - And-and that's fine. That's real. Thank you for letting it not be you. - Mm-hmm. - Because I was really feeling some kinda way about even inviting you to my wine cellar launch. I was like I don't want anyone there if they're not really for me. I choose to believe that she is innocent. We're good-- until further notice. In the spirit of positivity, I appreciate the fact that you've been trying to... - Let her know. - ...take little baby steps to kinda help bring NeNe and I around, at least to a good space. - So, you know her and Tanya met, and Tanya invited her to Toronto. - You know, I saw a picture online of them having lunch together. - Yes. - Oh, that's good. - I think she's probably worried about the energy, but I'm like, long as you deliver good energy, I know for sure she loves you. I know for sure she misses you. - NeNe would've been invited to my wine cellar launch had she not left the event early. - When is the launch? - It's on Friday. I have your invitation. I was just-- - Oh, I'm comin' with a band, baby. Comin' with drums and cheerleaders. - Now, wait a minute. You come with a band, they better be holding some wine, child. ♪♪♪ - Welcome to Ole G. Ole! Get that sh'money. - Well, I'll be glad to get some of that money, but it's been sittin' here now for almost a year. Somebody done broke the window. - They done broke a few windows. - Oh, gosh. - Are you ready for Ole G, tacos and tequila? I can't do that. Taco Tuesdays. Come on, babe. I can't. Todd decided he wants to do a Mexican restaurant, Ole G. Get it? O-L-E G, Ole G. Oh, anyway, but-- - Poppin'. - The vaults is where it's gonna be poppin'? - Yeah, so this is gonna be here. Somethin'-somethin' like a-a speakeasy type of setup. So, basically, this back door is gone. - Okay. - Because I'm extending the property back. You wanna-- you wanna see some of the-the layout-- the layout designs? - Babe. - What, babe? What? - You've been sayin' the same thing for six months, and we have not gotten any farther than where you-- this where we at, still. - You know what? You know what? I'm-I'm, like, tried of all the craziness. Every-everything I say I'm gonna do comes through. I haven't had one fumble yet. So, I don't know why I get the long faces, the huffin' and puffin'. Let me-- let-let me-- - Da-da-da-da-da, you're missin' my point. - Da-da-da what? - You're missin' my point. I'm cool with purchasing properties and redoin' 'em. I love all that. That sounds great. - Mm-hmm. - But the fact is, you got this. Then you went, and you had us to sign another lease next door to the Old Lady Gang Two 'cause you wanna start Old Lady Gang breakfast. Then you went and bought a 18-wheeler truck. What-what kinda truck is that with the trailer on the back? - Right, the hauler for the cars. - Talkin' about we're in the trucking business. - Yep. - You left this building sitting here for seven, eight months. - But, see, the thing is-- time out, time out, time out. Time out. - So, the point is, is, like, we can't keep putting money. - No, no, but, no, listen, listen, listen, listen. - Gettin' somethin' and don't finish. Todd has felt the pressure of him needing to make more money ever since we got together. Like, people have always questioned him being with me and whether he was with me for money and all this. - He ain't giving you a dime. He's sleepin', eatin' on you! - So, he's always been in this position of him trying to prove to the world that he doesn't need my money. It's gonna make. - Have you estimated how much it's gonna cost to even fix this up and get it to the vision? - Yeah, it's gonna be a few hundred thousand. - Few hundred thousand for this. Then how much is it gonna cost to get the OLG breakfast in order? - That might be, like, $60,000. That's just small. - Okay, and then how much is it gonna cost to get the other spot down the street in order? - That's probably another few hundred thousand. - Okay, but that's my point. - Listen, listen. - We can't overextend ourselves. - You hater. - I mean, when you start stretching yourself too thin, let one recession come through-- that could wipe you out. - You're worried about a recession, right now. - Who isn't? - I'm not. - It's been all over the little financial things. - I'm not-- I'm not-- - They're sayin' that they think that it's gonna come. You ain't been watchin'? - You're scaring me. You ain't as confident-- - I'm not tryin' to scare you. - You ain't as confident as you-- usually, you're the one that, like, "Go. "Do it. Don't stop. - I am! - "Why you all-- you should be bigger than this." - Listen. - Now, you're like, "Uh, this is too"-- - No, no, it's just that-- - It's like scared of success. - Nobody's scared of success. Don't try to talk to me like you just, like, oh, you're way more successful than me. Pace yourself. You know what I mean? "Oh, it's gonna be straight. We gotta get this. "We gotta that. Da-da-da." But, see, I've outlasted a recession. I know how it goes. You know, so, I'm a little bit safer in my moves, but he wants to tell me how it's supposed to be done. - Nobody's talkin' about-- - No, but I'm just saying, you're like I'm scared of success. - But you sound scared. I'm not trying to , like I don't believe in being successful. - Now-now-now, you're gettin' weird with it. - The only time we ever have arguments is about business. - Babe, I'm not arguing wit' you. - And then, now it's like our business life has taken over our entire life. I mean, it just-- I don't know. Todd and I having a million different businesses. It's like, ehh, the one-on-one time has been a little lacking. I don't want it to just seem like every day we're together that's all we do is work unless it's a birthday or anniversary. - I can take you out. You wanna go on a date? - Yes, that would be nice. - All right, I'll get it poppin'. - Okay, remember you said that, too. - I will. I promise. Promise. - M'kay. Coming up next... - I feel like he might propose tonight. - No, you don't think he's gonna do it tonight. - Bitch. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪ Like a cat and mouse you're chasin' me ♪ ♪ boy you're so thirsty ♪ ♪♪♪ - Oh, my God. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey, team. I'm sorry I'm late, but y'all know my man is in town. I was trying to get that last little bit in, child. He's leavin' in two days. So, as you can see, I got my clothes in my hand, my wig in my hand. Last year, I found this amazing space for The Bailey Wine Cellar and also The Bailey Room. Hi. - Hey. - Hey, Courtney. Hi, ladies. - How are you? - I built out The Bailey Room first, but now the door is open to The Bailey Wine Cellar as well.

Well, uh-uh, please, please. - Hold on, first and for-- is that cash or credit? - Cash, cash. - I'm so proud of Cynthia. She keeps comin' up with different ideas, and she sees it through. - I just wanted to, first of all, thank all of you guys for coming tonight. This is the first time I've opened up my own business. - Here we go, and on. Go, everybody! Go! Go get her! She's brilliant! - This is Noelle Robinson, the new face of Cargo. - She is not a one trick pony, honey. She's a stallion. - There's Miss Marlo. - Oh, there's Marlo. - Marlo. - Hi, sexy mama. Hi. This is beautiful. - Hi. How are you? - Oh, my God, it's so sexy. - Welcome.

Go get the gift. Oh, my goodness. Hey. - Hello. - Oh, you look so cute. - Thank you. - Welcome to The Wine Cellar. - You do, too. - Thank you. - Ooh, you're serving me today. So, girl, last night, I was drinkin'. Girl, I got a damn hangover. - You did? - I have a hangover. - What were you all celebrating, child? What was y'all doin'? - Dennis' birthday was yesterday. - Oh. - Yeah. He was like-- he wanted that for his birthday. - He wanted... - Me to come for his-- - Hmm... Okay. - Oh, this is gorgeous. - Oh, that was nice. - Really nice. - Yes. - See? - I'm like, boy, they really thought it was somethin'. - Thank you so much. - You have one more gift with it. - Oh, my goodness, Marlo. - There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Wait. Is this from you? "Congratulations on the big opening "of your new business. "I'm sure it will be a success. NeNe Leakes." - What? - Read it aloud. Share with us. We get all the bad. Give us the good? - What did it say? - "Cynthia, never in my wildest dreams "did I ever imagine that we would be in this place. "I've always been a supportive friend "towards you and today won't be any different. "I'm proud of you "and cheering for you from afar. "I hope you continue to have the courage "to run after your dreams." - Oh. - This is from her? - That's from her. - That sweet, babe. - Wow. - Yeah, that's sweet. - That's real nice. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - The fact that NeNe put pen to paper was beyond anything that I ever would've expected, honestly. The fact that she's not here because we're, like, fightin' over nothin', basically, really sucks. - Well, wasn't that so sweet? - Y'all in here crying from a card and some cheese. Ahh! Porsha! Now, you know that was nice. You know that was nice. - These grand gestures of cheese and crackers is just not it, girl. Y'all have way more to talk about than just that, not no damn cheese and crackers. We coulda had that at home, m'kay? Snack time. - You know, I wanna support, but since I was told-- - I know. You always do. You always do. You've done enough. This is very nice. Hi. How you doin', friend? Hello. Hey. Oh, my God! - Yes, baby. - How you doin', boo? - Hi. How are you? I'm sorry. Hi. - Oh, my gosh. - Hello, orange. This is beautiful. - Thank you. - So, listen, I wanted to invite you to dinner. - Yes. Okay. - Marc will be here. - Okay. - And Mike will be here, right? - Yes, he will. - So, let's just do a double, triple date. - Let's do it. - Okay? - That sounds like fun. - Yay! - Did you-- did you show-- Cynthia, did you show her the card? - I didn't even get to that yet. - Who is this from? - Open it. - Miss NeNe Leakes. Wait. I have to do it in her voice. Okay, dramatic. - "I've always been... "a supportive friend." - Is that her voice? - Well, since we fell out. - "And today won't be any different." - Really? - "I hope you continue to have"-- - Give me my card. - What? - I thought it was sweet. - What was that? - I thought it was very nice. - Listen, it takes a big person to be able to apologize. - That's true. - But I didn't see an apology in there. But it's not an apology. - I don't think she ever feels that it's an apology needed. She just feels like y'all just don't let bygones be bygones and move forward. - I really feel like NeNe's note was coming from a good place, and I know Kenya likes to joke around and throw shade, but, you know, I kinda feel like it's not the time or the place. We don't ever have to be besties, again. I feel like so much has been said and done, at this point. I still don't know who Snakegate is yet, you know? - That is true. - Girl. - But it would-- it'd be good to be cordial. You know who it is? - Uh, I wouldn't be surprised. That's all I'll say. - Do you think the snake is here? - Yes. - You do? - I do. I do. - Thank you. - So, where's your man? - He's here. Oh, he's here. You know, his family is here. - So, all of his family is here. - Yes, yes. - And they were coming tonight. - What did you have to say? - I'm telling you. I feel like he might propose tonight. - No, you don't think he's gonna do it tonight. Like, I don't think he's gonna do it tonight. - I do feel-- - I wasn't even thinking about that. We are, like, totally focused on the wine cellar. - I'm telling you I feel-- my-my stomach has butterflies. - Kenya. - Girl, is that what you had to say? - What? - I don't think so. He probably woulda invited my mom, and I don't think my mom is here. I don't think she's comin'. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Good. - Hey. You know, you remember Yovanna. - Yes. Hi. How are you? - Hi, Kenya. Good. I just wanted to make sure you got NeNe's gift. - I did. - You did. - Oh, you know about it, as well. - Yes, yes. - This is her card. I was just sharing it with Kenya. It's so sweet. - Okay, she sends her love. But I was like it's such a great gesture, and I said-- - No. - I'll be right back. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Why would you bring that up to her, I mean, when you and I are talking on our own? - Kandi, okay, come on. - That is not cool. Like, why would you do that? - Mike said to me, "Don't leave yet. "Don't leave early." Basically, giving me a heads up that he's about to do somethin' big, right? I give Kenya a little text. "I think he's going to pop the question." And all of a sudden, she just blurts it out. Like, why? Why would you do that? Bitch. I thought you had a real announcement to make. - No, it wasn't an announcement. It was just me talking. - You been acting like you had some real news. We're telling you all about the card and all this. - And I saw it. I saw it. - And then you even brought us back to that, so you can just go ahead and ruin it. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ - Just know that I'm not saying anything else to you. - Don't be mad at me like that, Kandi. - Why would you say, "You know what I think about that-- Da-da-da-da?" - Usually, you will say, "Don't say anything." - Girl, I mean-- - I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. I didn't-- I'm not trying to ruin her surprise. - Oh, my God. - I was just excited. - You went and ruined the surprise for her, though. - Should I say something to him? - Don't you say nothin' else. Don't you say a word. Why? Why would you do that? That was something I said in private. If I wanted to tell Cynthia that Mike was going to propose, I would've told her myself. - Now, you're gonna say I ruined the surprise, if he does. - What part of that made sense to you? If I say anything to you-- - Kandi, okay, okay. - About something important, you do not just go and run and say it to that person. Like, what is wrong wit' you? - Well, she just said she doesn't think he would do it unless her mother is here. - Hi. - What's up? How are you doin'? - I'm good. How are you? 7:15. - You know this guy. - Hey, how's it goin', girl? - How you doin'? - How you doin'? - Hey! - I cannot believe you. - I got the point. Now, you're making me feel bad. - I don't wanna talk about it no more. - Ugh. - I'll be back. Why would she do that? What is wrong wit' you? - Hi, Eva. You look beautiful, darling. - Hi, beautiful. Thank you. Good to see you. Congratulations on your wig launch. - I like your nails. Thank you. Did you get your gift bag? - I did, and I appreciate it. - Yay. Let me see. - She had me so mad, Todd. I had to walk out for, like, a few minutes to regain my composure. - "Purple Rain." - Oh, my God, hi. Whoo! - She said, "Yeah, I think, um, he's about to pop the question to you." - Why would she do that? - I don't know! - Hey, Marlo. Hey, you guys look cute. - Ooh! I'm like, this is not your moment. - They got problems? They got-- like, why would she? - No, they are, like, good friends. Like, why would you wanna ruin the moment for your good friend? That was just one of them moments where I just didn't understand Kenya. Huh? Sometimes she does things where I'm like... - Cynthia, what is the other room called? - Uh, that's the wine-- The Bailey Wine Cellar. - The Bailey-- this is just the lounge. - And this is The Bailey Room. - Okay. - The Bailey Room. - The Bailey Room, okay. - Which is an event space. - Is this the same space that the other event was at? - You know what, I think so. You was mean with red on. - What? - You was mean with red on. You had a red dress on. Remember? We were pregnant. - Oh, yes, I was, like, eight months pregnant. - That's me. - I'm really nervous, right now. - You were nervous, though. - I know. It felt like-- you thought I was nervous yesterday. I am really nervous, right now. Like, I'm done. - Oh, my goodness, did you see Mike and Linda and all of them? - I didn't see nobody. - Wow. I never showed it. - Is Noelle here? - Uh, Noelle's not here yet. - Oh. - She's supposed to be coming. - It looks so good. - Like, all right, here you go. All right, so what's gonna happen-- let's go talk about it out here. - All right. - I don't even know all the details. We went to his restaurant. He was on the phone FaceTiming. She was trying to-- he's like, "Porsha, I love you." I'm like, "Girl, tell him you love him, also." She was having one of her moods. - She-- - I'm like this girl on a rollercoaster. She's acting all tough sh-- like she doesn't care. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - But, listen, though, you care. - But nobody said I didn't care about him. - But you gave me-- oh, no, you-- - But I-- but I'm doing better. I'm-I'm getting better. We had-- we had counseling. Counseling has done-- - Y'all have been doing it. Oh, you did. - Yes, we've still been going. - The main thing, Porsha, is just communicating, and I told you that. It's communication. - And that was one of our biggest things. So-- - So, baby, is Noelle here or not? - Yeah, she's here. She just walked in. - She did? - Uh-huh. - All right. Where should I go to address the room, babe? - Uh, go up there. - Can you come with me? - Yeah, yeah, come on. Can I get everybody's attention, please? Miss Cynthia Bailey would like to make an announcement. It's Cynthia Bailey's time, y'all. Give it up for my baby. Go ahead. - All right, just really quickly. I'm not gonna say a lot. I appreciate you guys all comin' to celebrate The Bailey Wine Cellar. Let's just have a good time. I love you guys. Thank you so much for-- is any-- would anybody like to say anything? Uh-- - Eva-- Eva wants to speak. - Thank you. - You gonna speak, Kenya? - Uh, I'm good. I just said I'm proud of her. That's it. That's it. - Right, right. Come on, Eva. You know you're gonna speak. - I think Eva and I have come to a silent agreement. The one thing I think she has learned-- do not come for me unless I send for you, baby girl. - Congratulations. That's all. From me, from the Sterlings. - Come on, mama. - Congratulations to Cynthia. We know that she's been workin' on this wine cellar for quite some time. To see a woman with such aspirations and such beauty fulfill her dreams and to celebrate you tonight is amazing. So, congratulations. - Cheers! Thank you. - To Miss Cynthia Bailey! - Muah. - That's awesome. How come-- everybody got a glass in their hands? Anybody got glasses? This is a wine opening. Uh, guys, I would like to propose. - Oh! - A toast-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. - Oh, my God. - To-to Cynthia's new ventures. Um, baby, um, I have to admit when you said you was opening up a wine bar, I was like, "Why is she opening a wine bar? "She don't know nothin' about wine." Like, I know you like to drink wine. I know you like to drink a lot of wine. But, like you said, like a fine wine... - Uh, come on, shade. - You age well. You're graceful. You're classy. And I know anything you put your mind to, you're a boss. - Yes. - And it's gonna be highly and uber successful. So, with that being said, I'd like to raise my glass. - Yes! - Wait, wait, wait, hold up. You're doing it all wrong. - What? - You gotta toast with something more like this tonight. - Hold on. - Oh, okay. This is, um, Mike's kids. - Hold on. Hold on. This is my kids. - Uh, Ashlee. Ashlee's over here. - Hold on a second. Hold on, what's this? You want me to pop this? - What is that? - What is that? - You want me to pop this? - Pop it! - Stop! Stop. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa! What in the world? - Oh, my God. - Let's hear it. - My man, hey, hey, hey. - Oh, Cynthia. - Cynthia, you know I love you. You know you're my love. You're my life. You're my heartbeat. - Shh. - You're my emotions. You're everything that I live for, and I love you. I just wanna spend the rest of my life with you. - Aww. - Oh, my goodness. Okay, okay, okay. I'm not gonna cry. - Baby, you have, uh, accepted me for my past. You're here for me for my present. Now, I want you to be my forever. - Cynthia, aww. - Oh, my God. - Cynthia, will- will you marry me? - Oh, my God. - And can we be-- can we be a family, too? - Yes, yes, yes. - Yes, yes, yes. - Y'all are so sneaky. - Mm-hmm. - Congratulations. - I can remember a time when Miss Bailey said she didn't wanna get married anymore after her divorce with Peter. - It's not like everything is there working. - It's not my fault. - Nobody is saying it's your fault! - Yeah, that's where we were two ----in' years ago, and you keep on goin' back! We're not ----in' there! - I'm so happy for Cynthia. You know, she had been acting real thirsty for a moment, but now her thirst is quenched. - Now, she ain't gotta be thirsty no more. - Who's thirsty now? I got my man. I got my rock. It's time to chill. - all: Congratulations, CHill! Congratulations, CHill! - Yes, honey. - Oh, my God. ♪ What's goin' on ♪ ♪ you ain't goin' home alone ♪ ♪ sippin' feelin' all right ♪ ♪ keep it poppin' all night ♪ ♪ red cup fill it up knock it down girl ♪ ♪ show me what you're workin' with ♪ ♪ turn around girl ♪ - How do you feel? - I feel good. - Soon to be Mrs. Hill? - I feel good.

We're meetin' Cynthia, and Mike, and, um, and Todd, and Kandi. - Yes. So, we're meeting Cynthia, and Mike, and Todd, and Kandi. - Okay. - Magic Mike and Marc are never in town at the same time, so I had to set up this triple date so that we can all get together. For once, be in the same room and enjoy each other. Mike and Cynthia got engaged last night. - Wow. Are you serious? Yes. - Nice. Good for them, man. - Yeah, his whole entire family was there. - So, she was surprised? - She was. - She expected it. - Okay, so, here's- here's the thing. You know, I just had a feeling. Like, I just had a feeling. - You were being nosy. - I wasn't being nosy. I was being excited for my friend. - Okay. - And so, I was-- you know, I came in, and I told her. I was like, "I really, you know, I really think "that this might be the night." - And you snitched. - What? She knew it was coming. So, it wasn't like really big surprise. So-- - Now, turn left onto-- - You know what I do all the time. I summon the car. I tell the car to come get me. - You can do it remotely? You can put in the-- - Yes, it's literally a button on the app that says summon. - Well, ask it to come to New York and get me. - No, it's not gonna come to New York. - If it comes to New York, then I'm-- then I'm impressed. - It doesn't really turn, like, major corners or anything like that. - Oh, that's good. It doesn't turn. All right. - No, it turns. It just-- - Do you want-- do you want a self-driving car that doesn't turn? I'll just take a regular car. It takes me where I wanna go, but I can't summon it. - No, by itself, self-driving. - Self-driving but it can't turn. - I'm telling you. - All right. Well, I'm not arguing wit' you. - That's arguing? - No, I'm saying I'm-I'm agreeing with you. - I certainly feel like I've become more passive when it comes to my behavior in the relationship because I just don't like to fight. So, I would rather avoid a situation than to get caught up in an argument that leads to nowhere. And it's fast. Wait until you drive it a little bit. Like, it drives like a sports car. - You got my child in the car, and you're driving fast. - Well, like, if you need to get over and accelerate around somewhere or something, Yeah. - Then let's make sure your insurance policy is paid up when you're doing all these things. - Mm-hmm. - You self-drive. You speed. You do all that good stuff. - I don't speed. - Didn't you get a speeding ticket the other day? - No. - You told me you got a speeding ticket. - I'm an alpha female. Marc is an alpha male. We are both strong-minded individuals. So, when it comes to putting both of those positive charges together, it can really just kind of explode. I can't remember the last time I had a speeding ticket. - Coming up next... - Ask her about the wedding, how romantic I was in the wedding. - That was definitely the happiest day of my life. - It was second? ♪♪♪ - Are we corny because we try to dress alike? - We? I-I was already dressed. You're just like, "Should I wear blue like you?" - Well, 'cause I thought we were going on a triple date. - Hey, fiance. - Hey, fiance. - Hey, fiance. - Hi, folks. - Hi. - Hey. - How are you? - Hey, how you doin'? - Good. How are you? - Thank you. Are we treating the engaged couple? - I just wanna know how I should order. Do I go all out and somebody else pays? You're looking beautiful tonight, babe. - Thanks, babe. - Your makeup looks good. - Oh, I did it myself. - I know. You know I like it better when you do it yourself. - Oh, thank you. Sometimes he gets on my nerves. Sometimes he doesn't. But, right now, he's being super sweet. He got compliments, okay? He's giving me compliments. I love that. - Hey. - Well, hello. - What's up? What's up? - How are you? - What's going on? - What's up? Muah. - Muah. - How you doin'? - I'm good. - You look just like your daughter. - I do? Where should I sit? Over here? - No, ladies on this side. - Ladies, okay. - Fellas on that side. - Okay. - Quick question, like after last night became official-- - Mm-hmm. - Did y'all both have to hit y'all phones? Like, don't hit me no more. It's official. - Uh, somebody got some congratulation texts. I actually-- I actually haven't heard from any of my, uh, exes. - Okay. - All right, Come on. - Huh? - You ready? - Yeah. - So, how is your first day as fiance? - You know what? I felt different today. - Did you? - I really did. It even looked different laying in the bed. You know what what's weird? When Kenya came in, she came right up to me, and she was like... "I have a feeling Mike's going to propose tonight". - Yeah, I was kinda upset about that. - And I was like, "What?" I was like, "Why would you?" First of all, I just wouldn't even ever-- - Hi. - Oh, hey. How are you? - Hello, fiance. - How are you? - Hey, Marky-Marc. - Hey, how you doin'? - How you doing? - What's up, man? - Heard you got some big news. - I know. It's official, brother. - Good to see you. - Good to see you, too. - What's up, man? - Good to see you. What's up? - We were thinking. - What? Wife swap? - How did you know we were gonna say that? - I didn't know. - I'm telling you. She's, like, psychic. I told you. I told you. - Y'all are doing the music chairs. There you go. Okay. All right. Here we go. - That's funny. - All right. - The last time we did a wife swap in Mexico, things were very different. - I've scrambled the seating arrangement. - In other words, you breaked us up because, uh, you're not coupled up. - Who was Kenya with? Oh, Miss Lawrence. Well, honey, things have definitely changed. - Welcome to McKendrick's. May I start you off with a cocktail? - Yes, cocktails. - I would love. - What can I get for you? - Um, can you do a French martini? - May I have a margarita on the rocks with salt? - Old fashioned. - Rings. - Ring. - I know, I'm so used to looking at y'all's rings. I'm like, oh, I have a ring on, too. - Yes. - I'm part of the ring club. - It's so pretty, too. - Thank you. - So, how was it, Mike? Were you nervous? - I was nervous, a little frustrated because just trying to get everything together, not trying to tell her what was going on. You know, but it-it worked out in the end. As long as she's happy, that's all that matters. - Well, we got a wedding to plan. - Oh, gosh. - That's a whole 'nother story. - Why? - We've already gotten dates. - We're trying to figure out dates. Well, we're trying to figure out where. Um-- - Oh, I got the place already. - You do? - What? - You done planned it already. - I got to work last night. I was up last night. - Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh. - I was like, yep, let me get my little stuff together. - She's blowing the budget without even talking to ya. - I did our wedding. I'm good at sticking to a budget. - It would've been nice if we coulda stuck. - It was gor-- and talk to him. Talk to him. - I'm not gonna-- I'm not gonna say a word. - I was just telling him I need a do over 'cause he-- I was saying how he got on his knee, and it was, like, a real thought out proposal. - Mm-hmm. - And then he said-- how did you propose? - Differently. Very differently. - What did you do? - What does that mean? You know, I'm-- - Go ahead. Just tell 'em. - She flew into New York. I think she was working, and it was late at night. - Okay. - All right? And she woke me up. I was sleeping. I walked to the- the door, and I said, "What are you doing here? "I didn't know you were coming." So, I ran inside and grabbed the ring and ran back outside. - And guess-- listen to what he said. And what did you say? - What did you say? - I said, "Look who's official, now." - That was his proposal. - Okay. - Yeah. - That's cool. Spontaneous. - I thought it was fine. - So, you didn't even ask the question. - No. - He just told you. - Yes, and he did not get on his knee. - I was in the kitchen. - You were not on bended knee. - So, ask her about the wedding, how romantic I was at the wedding. - That was definitely the happiest day of my life. - Ooh. - I'd say. - It was second? - Second happiest day? - Hmm, neck and neck, you know? - I mean, you gotta understand winning Miss USA is a big deal. - Uhh... - I'm pretty shocked that Brooklyn didn't make it into the top two moments of Kenya's life. Okay, number one is Miss USA, and number two is your wedding day. Yeah, your priorities are a little weird to me. - So, what about this? I don't know if you guys did premarital counseling but with you-- - We haven't yet. - Are you gonna do premarital counseling? - I think we should. - I believe in counseling. - I do, too. - I mean, I've been divorced. - Yeah. - He's been divorced twice. - Yeah. So, what about a prenup? You guys talk about a prenup? - Oh-- - So, you think you should get some of my money? - Time out. Time out. Listen to me. Listen to me. I don't want your ----in' money, man. Damn. That's all y'all think about is money, you, your mama, all y'all. - A prenup? - Uh-huh. - And then you signed it, right? - You do? - Uh-huh. - We all feel like we're gonna be together forever, right? And to me, I guess a prenup is just like insurance. You never wanna use it, but you just wanna have it just in case. And I feel like I would rather us work out what is gonna happen when we're in a good place rather than when we are in a bad place, and you turn into somebody that I don't know. - You know Marc didn't want a prenup. We don't have one. - You guys don't have a prenup? - No. - Like, he didn't even wanna have a conversation about it. - We didn't have a-- we never talked about a prenup. - Yes, we did. - Kenya, you-you real-- revisionist history. - No, I'm not. I-- we definitely talked about a prenup. - I never-- I never-- - And you said you didn't want one. - I never-- I never had a discussion about a prenup 'cause, in fact, for me, you bring uprenup to me, I'm-- it's over. For me, you bring up For me, you bring up prenup to me, I'm-- it's over. Yeah, I'm not gonna-- - Well, I think that's how strongly you felt about it. - I'm-I'm not-- I'm not gonna marry someone if I have a prenup. If you're, like, with me, you're all the way with me, or you're not with me. - I started off my career in the entertainment industry, and I was a corporation since I was 17 years old. I'm a self-made person. Now, if you help me build something, that's different. - Right. - But if I had something before you, and you had something-- - I helped her do Kenya Moore Haircare. Kenya Moore Haircare was a mess. I helped her-- I never asked for anything. - Wt? Excuse me. - It was a little messy. So, I'm like here's how we're gonna fix it. Let's do this. It's-- that's what-- that's what we do. Marc's a dirty player. He's the type of person that will grab dirt off the ground and throw it in your face. - Let's just say you guys see that, okay, we don't get along. This is not working. You know, it's more volatile than it is peaceful. You know, let's go our separate ways but let's say she decided to turn into that bitch and be like, "You know what? "I want part of Soco." - Good question. You know what I told her? You can have it. I'll build another one. I told her that. She can have everything. Take it all. - I-I had the same attitude. - You can take everything. I don't care. I built it from scratch. I'll do it again. - So, would you put that in writing? - Ooh, y'all heard what she-- heard what he said, now, y'all. - That's like a legal document-documentation, right there. - Time out. I'm his legal counsel. - I-- - Yeah. - Strike that from the record. - Hey, you know what? He's intoxicated. He wasn't in his right mind. - Todd, she can't-- she can't have the overseas stuff. She can have everything domestically. I got the overseas stuff-- that's mine. - Is this your first marriage, too? - It's not. - Oh, okay. One year? - Two years. - Okay, two years. What have you seen in this two years? Y'all are still newbies. - No, it's true. Honestly, I'm-- we're-we're-we're different in a-- in a lot of ways. Ken likes a little flash. You know what I mean? - So, when you-- when you say, "Flash," though-- - Let me finish before I-- - Okay. - 'Cause you're jumping in. And you gotta respect the-the conversation. Opposites attract. You gotta respect people for their differences, and it's fine. But, for me, I don't wanna be Mr. Flashy. The flash is-- it's not real. - Um, I don't necessarily think I like flash. I'm a self-made person, and I'm very proud of that fact. So, with that said, I remember we had a conversation about me driving a Bentley before we got married, and he-- - So-so, no, I didn't say that. - What did you say about my car? - Can I respond? I didn't say about the Bentley. I said, "Let's take care of the house "before we take care of the Bentley." - But my house is paid for. So, if I wanna buy a car-- - There's prio-- there's priorities. - It's my money. If I wanna drive a Bentley, so be it. - I'm gonna leave it at that. - One of the biggest issues between Kenya and Marc is, Kenya's a big personality, but Marc is a strong personality. Somebody's gotta bend, and somebody's gotta give, and I don't see either one of them bending and giving. - I care about people that matter in my life, my kids. I care about my family, the people who are real. So, that's why I like hanging out with Todd and you. Even people say NeNe, blah, blah, blah. NeNe was nice to me the first time I met all of you. People tell me things about her, but she showed me the ultimate respect. Let me tell you what she did when I met her. She said, "Hi, Marc. "Let me introduce you to my husband." I found that to be an incredibly respectful thing. She's nice to me. I'm not gonna dog her. - I have to remind Marc. When you found out that NeNe said what am I carrying, like a buffalo or something, you-you got very offended by that because she was talking about your unborn child, and that made you extremely upset. - Say goodnight to everybody. Speedy recovery, Gregg. You're always in my prayers. - Thank you so much. She's gonna have a buffalo, isn't she? - Girl. - It's an inappropriate comment, but didn't she reach out to you after and tried to apologize? - No, she actually didn't. - You told me she reached out to you and texted you. - No, she never tried to apologize. - Okay, all right. - And I don't think she's ever apologized for anything. - So, my wife and NeNe have friction, but that's not me. So, I don't have a problem with the woman. The woman is very nice to me. - But I was highly offended, and so were you, and I just wanted to remind you of that. - It's about respect and how people treat you, and that's what I kind of put in the forefront at this age. That's all I'm gonna say on it. - No. - Respect is key. - Why are you doing this to your wife? You see her face. You see she ain't happy wit' you, right now. Why are you going on with this? Like, you're supposed to have your wife's back, not NeNe's back. Like, you're doing too much, right now, Marc. No. - I will-- I will say this about NeNe. Despite the differences you guys have, she's always been nice and kind to me. But any time somebody does somethin' to harm her or make her feel a certain way, it makes me feel a certain way because I don't wanna see her sad. If it affects Kandi, I think it affects you. I don't wit' you. - If-if-- but I don't-- but, yeah, if it affect-- And-- but even though we're not married it, there's still that bond. - You're a team. - We're a team. - Mm-hmm. - How is everyone doin', so far? - Can I have another drink, please? - Of course, you may. That's my next question. - He'll have another one, too. - Are you trying to get me drunk? - No, I'm-I'm on a date. Like, I-- - I know. - Y'all are about to have-- you got Brooklyn. You're gonna have Bronx. You're gonna have-- you're gonna get all of 'em. - I wanna propose a toast. - Oh, yeah. We should've done that. I apologize. - Yes. Um, yes. So-- - Go ahead. Good job. - I wanna congratulate this beautiful couple, Mike and Cynthia, for just being you and just having real dedication to each other, for having a real friendship. I wanna propose a toast to Kandi for just being that ride or die, that couples goal. - Yeah. - She's-she's the senior one in the group. - Couples goals. - Yes. - I wanna be like you. I wanna build a team. Um, and I wanna propose a toast to the men here. Hopefully, you are ride or dies yourselves. - Absolutely. - I know that you guys always refer to the women as being such, but, hopefully, the men are here doing the same and holding us up as we, um, wear the crowns that we wear on a daily basis. - I knew that Kenya and Marc were having some issues, but, honestly, I had no idea how bad things were. - Again, congratulations to the newest, uh, to be wedding couple in the group. - Yes. - We love you, and cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Salute. - Salute. - Next time, on "The Real Housewives of Atlanta"... - What's up, Toronto? All right! - Whoo! Carnival! ♪♪♪ - For you to go on a rant and just be like, "Is she even ----in' healed from her C-section scar-- - That was definitely not what I said. - So, Kandi's a liar? - No, I'm not. - So, she's making it up? - How you doing? - You came. - I'm here. - You got on the horse. The girls are gonna be really excited to hear you're here. They don't know yet. - I feel like if everybody could just calm down, we can finally get this all out. Hear what I have to say. - No, listen to me. I will talk to you another time. - No, but hear what I gotta say. - I do not-- I do not-- Kenya, you shut the up, bitch. You shut the up, bitch! - You shut the up! - Don't tell me to-- You shut the up! You got the wrong-- you got the wrong mother----er. - Please go. - Mother---ing-- - This is ----ing crazy. - She need to go. - For more information on "The Real Housewives,"
