 Endgame (2011): Season 1, Episode 7 - Gorillas in our Midst - full transcript 
 When Jia, a Chinese cryptologist, and her friend, Sophie, a journalist, come to Balagan for help in finding Jia's missing suitcase, he declines, bored by lost luggage. But Sam, who has fallen head over heels for Jia, convinces him to take the puzzle. Balagan deduces that Sophie has a scoop and Jia is her anonymous source. If Jia doesn't get her suitcase back before she's discovered as a whistle-blower, her life will be in danger. While Sam and Jia spark a romance, Balagan resists Sophie's advances, the pain of losing Rosemary still too fresh. Just as Balagan thinks he has retrieved Jia's suitcase, he realizes there are more players in the game than at first he thought.

 [Elevator dings] Thank you. Where are my Russian newspapers? The German newspapers? Le Monde? You buy different papers every day. If you don't take The Times of Bucharest, nobody does, you see my problem? I see your excuse. I thought this was

 an international enterprise, not a roadside motel... You're with the conference? Yeah, I booked online six weeks ago. Security conference? But this reservation's for... Dora the explorer? We're obviously experiencing technical difficulties. Obviously. What about my French chocolates? French chocolate? Ha, ha... Yes! People prefer Swiss... Am I not people?

 I can tell you what you are. You can tell... You... Tell me what I am... That's it, ruskie. The store is yours. Oh-ho, great! Goodbye and good luck. Don't let the door hit your bum on the way out! I quit, and you can thank Rasputin Balagan. Milk chocolate... [Toy car whines squeakily] Ah... Barbara! Mr. Balagan. Delightful morning, isn't it? Mr. Balaga... Oh, hey, sorry to bother you. Uh, we'd love a photo. Do you mind? With pleasure. Uh, no, actually, could you take... of us? They don't even have my reservation. They said it's under "dora the explorer." The morons... 85. You have 85 bottles on display. Really? I thought we had 84. 85. I counted twice. What's your most expensive champagne? Uh, Veuve Cliquot, 300 bucks a bottle. Perfect. I'll pre-order one for tomorrow. For now, a glass of milk. Does your hotel have a luggage room? Yes, ask at the front desk. But is it secure? It has a lock. [Hasty knocking on door] You're late. Is everything okay? They sent a colleague with me. Why? I don't know. They must have found out about us. No, we were careful. I'm sure it's fine. This is not my suitcase. [Hasty knocking on door] Make your move. [Knocking grows insistent] Um, should I get that, Mr. Balagan? No, you should make your move. [Knocking resumes, louder] Not that one. Think again. Look. Look, Sam. That's a stupid move... Why are you bothering me? Mr. Balagan, my name is Sophie Maigret. Sophie Maigret, from The Journal, yes, I've read your coverage of the middle East. - Thank you... Biased. Yes, everybody says that. Must be doing my job. And I'm Jia Zhang. I need your help. Yes, come in, come in, come in. Have a seat at the bar. That, over there, is a Sam. Hey, Sam. Sam Besht. Hi. Hey. Hello... Uh, Mr. Balagan, this is, um, this not my suitcase. Then call the airport. Uh, no, it happened in the hotel lobby. They have staff for that, you know. And they looked everywhere, but they found nothing. I'm not surprised. Incompetence is their signature. Yes, the hotel manager finally suggested that we talk to you. Jia's giving a talk at the conference tomorrow, and the speech is in the suitcase. The Internet security conference? Cool. What do you do? I'm a cryptologist for Jade Dragon. Oh, what kind? I do homomorphic encryption. Algebraic cryptosystems? Yeah, lattice-based. Wow, that's, uh... Sam... Sam! Heel. I am sorry. I don't know what the hotel mismanager told you about me, Ms. Maigret, but I don't do lost luggage. Please, Mr. Balagan, it's important. And I can pay you $5,000. It takes more than money. [Tsks] Okay, uh, but, um, wait a second... I, um... Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Mr. Balagan, you're really not gonna help them? They couldn't even bother to tell me the truth. I don't know what is in that suitcase, but it's more than a speech. Your move. So you'll help Hugo, you'll even help complete strangers, but you won't even do this one thing for me? For you? You want me to help her because you think she's cute. She's a brilliant cryptologist for, like, the world's biggest firewall developer. Brilliant? She's cute, Sam. She's both. Please? Okay, fine, bring back the liars. Don't skip. [Opens door] Hey! [♪] [Crowd roars] Sync and corrected by dr.jackson for www.addic7ed.com Before we begin, what is really in your suitcase? Uh, sensitive information. What kind of sensitive information? I really can't say. Well, let me guess, jade dragon is state-run, so, Sophie, you're writing an exclusive, and, Jia, you are her main source. A whistle blower, perhaps? Jia was supposed to attend the conference alone, but her company decided to send along a colleague at the last minute. His name's Kang Ming. Uh, in China, anyone could be a spy... Yes, Russia taught your country well, but unless you tell me what's in your suitcase, I cannot help you. Okay, well, can I trust you? Because this information could get me killed. Seriously? I have no interest in endangering your life. Have you heard of computer worms? [Scoffs] Yes. Okay, well, this one is designed to destroy entire networks. Elaborate. It can shut down a country's water system, power grids, hospitals, anything. Everything. Cyber terrorism. In the wrong hands, this worm could be deadly. Is this important enough for you, Mr. Balagan? For now, sure. There's no identification in here. We think it belongs to a tourist... It doesn't. The pants are a 30-inch waist, but this belt is a 38. And this shirt? The tag is still on the collar. This was no accident. Your suitcase was stolen, and this dummy bag left in its place. Someone must've found out what we were going to do. Hugo! What's up, Mr. B? Where is your little hominid friend? Oh, searching for your pride, Hugo? Save it, Balagan, I'm not in the mood. Someone from the stupid security conference is hacking our computer system. [Punches computer angrily] [Gasps] Ooh... [Banging around] Spiderman in 1308 just ordered 12 dozen blts. [Chuckling] Well, maybe those security guys don't like you security guys tarnishing their good name. Stuff it, Balagan. Ah, such eloquence. I need to see footage of the lobby. You know the drill. Time? 8:45. No, later, later. It's later... There, right there. Fix that. Can't. It's on the footage. [Snatches book testily] Fix the footage. Can't. It's probably one of those hackers from the conference. Is that the best you can do? I can say thank you for the tip. [Chuckles] You get what you pay for. Oh. So, what do you remember about your arrival? I need specifics. A poor lady, her luggage fell over. Her things went everywhere. I helped her pick them up. Whoever pushed her luggage probably stole your suitcase. What else? A couple. They had skis... They were arguing. It makes it fishtail, that's what it does. Oh, it does not... Our first vacation without the kids, he's staring at other women. Can you blame me? She was a supermodel. Her luggage alone must have cost more than our car. He was so hypnotized, he knocked over that vase with his skis. Your skis. [♪] [Slap] [Vase shatters] Who pushed over your luggage? The bellhop. Spiteful little prick. Didn't like my tip. The hotel pays you. You're lucky i gave you that much. You know what? Keep your change. [Vase shatters] So you're the one who pushed over the woman's luggage? [Sarcastically] Yeah, right. I don't care if you did. I don't care if you care. I didn't do it. Then who did? It was that kid. He was a total brat... [Cash register churning] Why did you knock over the woman's luggage? A man paid me to. What did he look like? Charge these to my room. Like you. Old. [Chuckles] And, uh, was he wheeling a small black suitcase? Yeah. So you still don't know who has my suitcase, do you? There is a landmark psychology experiment when you're asked to watch how many times a basketball team passes a ball while... Sam? While a man in a gorilla suit walks across the court. This is all very fascinating, but where is the suitcase? If you would let Sam finish. Well, you never really notice the gorilla because you're too busy watching the basketball. Exactly. Too much focus makes you blind, Sophie. The key to magic, politics and chess... Distraction. [Arguing] You're lucky i gave you that much. Keep your change. So now we know how the suitcase was stolen, we can figure out who stole it, and then the real fun begins. [Balagan]: Tell me, how does a reporter find a whistle blower? She found me. It happens sometimes when you travel outside a hotel. You should try it. Oh, so now you also write the self-help column. Speaking of work. Sam, find that skiing couple again. I want to see their photos. Alcina! Not again, Mr. Balagan. I need you to check on a guest for me, make sure he has fresh towels. What guest? That guy behind me, Kang Ming. It's not for me, it's for Sam. Sammy? Mm-hmm. You are a bad influence. Maybe. [Slurping drink] [Sighs] Well, thanks for agreeing to help Jia, Mr. Balagan. She's... incredible. Mm. You know, her master's thesis at M.I.T. Was on the scytale transposition cipher used by the spartan military. How cool is that? I think you need a drink to sober you up. I just spent my last 10 bucks. That's no problem. Danni, a vodka. And for Sam here, maybe a little water. You sure? He goes all wild man with a couple waters in him. Oh, hey, that skiing couple said that they'd e-mail me their photos. Good. So, Jia works for Jade Dragon, and their biggest rival is barton secure. You think they stole her bag? Corporate espionage is big business. Sam? It's on him. You texted? No. Yeah, I got an emergency text from you. No, you didn't. Yes, I did, look. Hmm, I guess someone at the security conference is playing pranks on you, Hugo. What? Why me? I can't think of a single reason. [Chuckling] [Key card warbles, latch unlocks] [Shutter clicking] Don't spend too much time flirting, Sam, we have a suitcase to find. [Camera shutter clicking] You might not believe this, but when my life's not in danger, I'm actually a lot of fun. Well, it's really brave what you're doing. Or really stupid. [Sighs] Um... I got you this. I thought you might want something to remember your trip by, not that you want to remember losing your bag, but maybe there's something you'd want to remember, or... not. Aw. I really like it. Thank you. You're welcome. [Shutter clicking] Fresh towels. I assume a rival company would want this computer worm, too, yes? Yes, but how would they know it was in my suitcase? You told them. You planned to sell it to them, and this do-gooder ruse is meant to avert suspicion. If I was working a secret deal with our competitors, why would I hire you to expose me? Because maybe I'm your distraction. That's your big strategy, blaming the victim? Trust the reporter to always see in black and white. A colleague took these in Kang's room. What does it mean? Oh. Yeah, I was right. Kang is spying on us. We shouldn't be doing this. Oh, yes, we should. We're getting closer. Found him! The gorilla. All right, so here you have the skiers, you've got the little kid, you've got the supermodel with the luggage, and here... Is our gorilla. Expand it. Gavin... You know him. I hate him. He's a reporter? Mm-hmm, Gavin Grady. My lover till he stole my tour de France doping story. I should've known. He just got fired. He must be getting desperate. I can't read it, it's in code. I did consult a cryptologist! He said it could take a year... H-hang on. Hang on! I got another call, hang on... Hello? You bastard. You're losing your touch, Sophie. It took you half a day to figure that out. Just bring it back. Sorry, payback for stealing my tour de France story. The... I've been tracking you guys for months. You should tell your source to carry a different suitcase once in a while. The information is encrypted, idiot. Look, my source will decode it, but only if we split the byline. Maybe... But no tricks. No tricks. We share the story, but you protect her identity. Fine, but my name goes first, and I want a public meet, I don't want to get drugged again, like Berlin. The orchid room, Huxley hotel. Tomorrow, 10:00 A.M. Bring the suitcase. Don't screw me. I won't screw you if you don't screw me. [Muttering] She's totally going to screw me... He's totally going to screw us. We're going to screw him. I don't want anybody to get screwed, I just want my suitcase back. Sam, are... Are you busy right now? No... Yes? Uh... D-do you think you'd mind listening while I practice my... Oh, your speech? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. My little mulcheek's all grown up. [Door closes] Cognac? Yes, please. Thank you. My grandmother drinks this. At least someone in your family has good taste, yes? [Clink] Oh. I'm too late. Another woman's caught you already... No, no, no, um... It's too early. My fiancee was... Oh, of course. I read about it. I'm sorry. That's okay. Anyway, I prefer men who wear shoes. Hi. Good morning. Oh, did you want one, too? [Chuckling] Thank you. I'll change. [Knock on door] Feel free to ignore that, by the way. Ark... Pippa? Ah, Pippa, come in. Sophie Maigret, this is Pippa Venturi, my... What are we? Stuck with each other? You poor thing. I'll see you downstairs. Okay. Bye. What? No, Pippa, it's not what it looks like. Even-even if, it's none of my business. How are you? I need to talk to you. It's about Rosemary. Well, go ahead. I-I wanted to tell you in person... But I-I don't know how to say it... Pippa, just say it. Detective Evans... Jason Evans, with the big feet, yes. He gave me Rosemary's autopsy report, and she was... Rosemary... [In a small voice] I'm really sorry... She was pregnant. Did you hear me? Yes. I know. You know? Mm-hmm. But you never said anything. Why would I? Maybe because she was my sister. [Door opens] Pippa! Pippa... Pippa! Pippa, you've suffered enough. Talk to me. Neither of us is going to get over this, but we have to learn to live with it to move on, okay? Move on? Really? Hey, uh, you want to go for a walk, like, outside? I didn't think so. Pippa, I know you're angry, but you need to listen... Rosemary, she didn't tell me much, but I thought she would've told me that. We were going to, that's why we came here, to tell you in person. We just ran out of time. [Banging from elevator] [Hugo, muffled] Hello? Hey, can you hear me? Is somebody there? Hello! If you can hear me, my name is Hugo Lum, director of hotel security! I'm trapped in this elevator! The emergency phone is dead, and my radio can't get any channels, so... If you can her me, get some help. Hello? Can you hear me? Sam... I don't deserve this! Where are you coming from? Nowhere. [Whimpers] [Sniffling] I'm head of security... Those are yesterday's clothes. Yeah, maybe. [Hugo screams] She slept with you. [Laughs] Well, don't look so shocked. [Hugo, muffled] Okay, I hear voices. Please help me! Sam, you're in the middle of a game, and you don't even realize you're being played. It's not a game, it's real. It's real. Why can't you, just for once, believe that I know what I'm doing. Yes, but do you know what she's doing? Go home and get changed. [Elevator dings] [Hugo banging on doors] Hello, are you still there? Hello, person outside, hello! [Muffled] Damn! Damn! Hello? [Banging urgently] Hugo! Oh, God, not you. I can help you. No, no, no, no, that's okay, Balagan. Just-just call Gurjit, okay, he'll know what to do. No, Hugo, we need to barter. No! What? Yes, yes, it's easy. You just have to do your job. No... Okay, whatever, just... Just get me the hell out of here. Stay right there. Balagan? [Emergency phone rings] Oh! Hello! Hello. Thank God. Yeah. What? No, I don't want any pizza! How did you get this number? [Stammering] Who is... [Banging angrily] [Slurping milk] What if Gavin doesn't show? I'm prepared for that, too. You know, my father said the thing that he admired the most about you was your ability to use one strategy to hide another. Gavin! You look like you slept in your car. Sophie, you look like you slept with... Arkady Balagan. Gavin Grady. I covered you in that wild tournament in Tripoli. What was that, a million bucks? That was then. So, where's our source? Mr. Grady, you're going to have to come with us. What for? You stole a guest's bag. That's against the law. What proof do you have? You are in possession of the stolen bag. I knew it, you set me up! Payback. That tour de France story was mine! This isn't over! He really brought it? My job is done. Uh, this isn't my suitcase either. Whoever own this bag has Jia's suitcase. What is that? I don't know. Some sort of code. Engineering blueprints. Could take thousands of hours to decrypt. Gavin Grady stole the suitcase from you, but it was not your suitcase. Jia's suitcase was switched twice. Once, before she even entered the hotel, and then again, inside the lobby, yes? So, there were three suitcases? Mm-hmm. Look, I don't care how it happened, I just want my bag back. The longer it's out there, the more danger I'm in. When, for certain, did you last have your bag? I opened it in the taxi, on the way to the hotel. So then the first switch must have happened between the taxi and the lobby. [Arguing couple, crashing vase] Gavin could've just brought another dummy bag to confuse us. Unlikely. He was only willing to share his byline with you because he thought this was Jia's, and he couldn't read it. Gavin didn't know anything and now we don't know anything. I have a speech to give. Kang's probably wondering where I am. [Elevator dings] Oh. Oh. Hey. I was just, uh, coming to hear your talk. Oh, that's very sweet. Uh... listen. Maybe it's too dangerous for you to go back to China. I think you should come stay with me, here. Don't you live with five engineering students? Eight, but, um, I have my own room. Sort of. Well, I wish I could, but if I don't go back, then the company would know that I was the whistle blower, and I'd never be safe. [Elevator dings] [Whispering] I can't be seen with you. And our first gorilla is... Gurjit, give me back my 20. I didn't do anything. It's on the footage. Who was the first gorilla? Where did he come from? Mr. Balagan is right. I am an incompetent fool! What did you see? I know who knows. Danni! Hello. How are you? You look very nice tonight. [Tersely] Mm-hmm. "I want something" face. What? Uh, yes, the kiosk clerk. I need to ask him something. Oh, wait, you mean the ex-kiosk clerk. My friend, Seymour, who quit because some narcissist threw a pastry at his head... Yes, yes. I need to find out who he saw outside the hotel after our... Disagreement. Please? Just for the record, Seymour has been working here since, um, forever, and he's a really good guy. I'm sure. I'm sorry, sir. Your bag isn't in our luggage room. What? What-what do you mean? I have my claim ticket. Well, perhaps there's been a mix-up. Don't worry, we'll sort it out. Just give me a minute. I don't have a minute. I have an important meeting now. It's a small, black suitcase, with wheels. Thank you. Okay, I will tell him. Bye. So... He's not going to say anything to you. Until... You... Until I... What? That was an awesome talk, thanks very much. Can I... Can I get a copy? Uh... A glass of your most expensive single malt, make it a double, and charge it to penthouse one. [Hugo chuckles quietly] Nice one... If you please? If I please, what? I-I need a seat. Thank you. Thank you... Come on, Mr. Big Man, let's hear it. We had a misunderstanding. Mm-hmm... There, I admit it. That's no apology. I was promised an apology. I did not mean to suggest that you are wanting at your job. On the contrary, I was merely saying that your... Level of competence is... Consistent with local customs and standards. And? And what? And I regret throwing a perfectly good croissant at your beautiful head. Eh, good enough. What? W-what do you mean "good enough"? Aw, come on. I would have made the Russian gargle glass. All right, what do you want to know? After our confrontation, did you see anybody outside the hotel who was suspicious in any way? No. Think. Well, there was this one guy, uh, counting, counting, everything in sight. I know that counting guy. Milk. Room 1207. [Knocks firmly] Go away! I can get your suitcase back. [Chinese television blares from inside] How do you know about my bag? That it was not yours, it was somebody else's. I don't have anyone else's bag. I don't even have my bag. It was stolen from the luggage room, where it was supposed to be perfectly safe! Yours was stolen, too? Yes. [Stammering] Stolen too? What? Someone stole Jia's suitcase from the luggage room thinking it was the counting guy's. Okay, this puzzle's really puzzling. Sammy, it's simple. For you maybe. I will explain. Oh, you will, will you? [Alcina scoffs] Sam, you are Gavin. Mr. Balagan, you are counting guy, and I am Jia. Counting guy accidentally took Jia's bag, and Jia ended up with his. Then Gavin then took what he thought was Jia's bag, and left her the fake, and counting guy put Jia's bag in the luggage room, thinking it was his. Then someone stole it. Easy. But why would somebody want to steal counting guy's bag? Because they want this, whatever this is. Mr. Balagan... What is it? An unexpected twist. I found it. I found Jia's bag. I have to hide it somewhere safe. Why, Mr. Balagan? Because I'm still not sure who I can trust. We can put it in 718, it's empty. Good idea, Alcina. Your sex life is clouding your judgment. I think it might be love. Well, while you were in love, you fell asleep, and she took my spare key card from your wallet... No. Yes, and planted this in my suite. Okay, no, there's no way that Jia would do that. I knew there was a reason why she slept with you, and when I find her in room 718, you will see I was right. Sorry. What are you doing here? Mattress testing. What are you doing here? The bag, where is it? Well, that is the problem with those little devices, Sophie. I never said I had your bag, I said I have your bug. So, you said you were you're going to publish Jia's story, but you're the one who's going to sell it to barton secure, jade dragon's rival. I am on assignment for "The Journal." But corporate espionage pays better. Name your price. I really don't have Jia's suitcase. Why bug my room? Well, now, how could I trust you? You always play more than one strategy. And so do you. Your father must be proud. Question, how long have you been working with Barton Secure? Nine months maybe. And when did Jia contact you? Five months ago. [Cell phone rings] What is it, Sam? Well, ignore Gavin's threats. All we have to do is follow the suitcase, it's fine. Yes, 10 minutes. I can still get you what's in Jia's suitcase, but you're going to have to pretend to be a genuine journalist for 15 minutes. Can you do that? I can do that. And triple my fee. I know where your suitcase is, but I need your help first. You found it? I counted 17 companies with sufficient motive. I invented something, something big. And you hoped to sell it at this conference. I had these meetings set up, but then my bag gets stolen? Coincidence? Or are they simply too cheap to pay me what my invention's worth? You were watching a mandarin show on your tv. Oh, I speak eight languages... English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese... Translate something for me. This. I'll need my dictionary. How would someone break into the luggage room? I told you, it's impossible. So, who installed the key card system? I don't know, Arkady, some company. Hugo, if you help me, I can make this hacker stop pranking you. Yeah, nice try, you don't know which ones are doing it. It's just one, and I can make him stop. Hey, Glenn, I just hacked into your plenty of fish account. [Laughing] Who's Berth... Oh, she's... flexible. [Laughing along] Whoa. So... You messed with the reservations. It was entertaining. Locking the security dick in the elevator? [Guys laugh] Hilarious, but stealing a suitcase from the luggage room at the hotel, now, that... Excuse us for a second, boys... Excuse us. All right, you got me. I stole Lester's bag out of the luggage lock-up, but get this, the guy's a genius. It was a dummy bag. It was just filled with a bunch of... Women's clothing? [Laughing] Yeah! And a toy elephant. Ashwell is a huge multi-national, why would you resort to petty theft? We tried to buy Lester's invention, but he's nuts. We decided it'd be cheaper to be sued than pay what he was asking. And what did he invent? Can't say, but it's paradigm shifting. And his price? A billion dollars. [Chuckles] Lester... Sit. You have one minute to negotiate a deal, or no one gets anything. Go! I said a billion. One million. A billion. One million. 500 million. Five million. 462 million. Lester... Are you kidding me? [Sighs] 50 million. Done! Go get the suitcase, fast. I have your translation for you. I wrote it down. Thank you. Ah... Just what I thought. Now, where's my suitcase? One moment. Sam! Here you go. Thank you, thank you, thank you. They're blueprints for my invention. Top secret. I created the code myself. It's part elvish. Impressive. One moment... I can see why this invention is so valuable. A security camera scrambler. The average person gets their photo taken by CCTV cameras 16 times a day, but with this invention, you are video-invisible. I can imagine its appeal. Thank you. Is that my suitcase? No, it's mine. Well, it's half-mine, right, Sophie? Gavin, out on bail already? Charges dropped. We had a deal. No, we cut the deal when you had the suitcase. Now you have nothing and this story is mine. I still have a story, of Jia Zhang, Chinese cryptologist for jade dragon security, attempting to leak information to "The Journal." You would put her life at risk for two columns on page 8... Okay, okay, wait, both of you, stop, stop. Sophie, would you not share a byline to save Jia's life? Of course. And, Gavin, you promise to protect Jia's anonymity? Better be worth it. Well... Here you go. What is it? It's a computer worm. It targets networks. It can destroy a country's entire infrastructure. Everything you need to bring a country to its knees. I can hear the Pulitzer calling me... Uh, us. Okay, well, it's been fun, but I have a flight to catch. Please, allow me. Oh, thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you for everything. Sam... Never mind, never mind. So, champagne at the bar? If it's on you. What are you doing? He's going to steal that. That is the point. Are you coming? I'll take the next one. Uh... Maybe I can save up, come visit, I could get a job there... It's time for me to go. I'll see you again, maybe. [Sighs] What do you mean, Gavin gets it? You promised me. I tripled your fee! I did you a favour. I saved your reputation. While you were playing Jia, Jia was playing you. What? Look. Remember when Jia said that Kang was making notes of her? That was a lie. He was keeping track of you. He followed me. Kang was Jia's partner, and you were the target. Well, she was a professional. She was three moves ahead of you. She picked you. She posed as a whistle blower, and she tried to feed you disinformation. I should have known. Well, it was a classic misdirect. Barton secure develops an anti-virus for a fake computer worm... And jade dragon sells the real worm to the highest bidder. Yes, the gorilla. Well, at least Gavin's reputation will be ruined with a story about a worm that doesn't exist. You're welcome. Thank you. You should call... If you ever leave this hotel. [♪] Are you okay, Sam? Yeah. I'm fine. You know, it's, uh, it's cool. She had to go. Whatever, I understand... Sam... Sam, Sam... Jia had nothing to gain by sleeping with you. Her move was motivated solely by... By affection. Yeah? Yeah. So... That means that... I was right, and... You were wrong? I've been wrong before, back in the 20th century. Shall we resume our game? Yeah. I'm on a roll. [♪] Sync and corrected by dr.jackson for www.addic7ed.com Starfruit! Starfruit! Is a6 to b7. My son, Christopher, has vanished, and you are going to find him. And why is that? Because I'm Vivian Huxley. The least you could do is find the birthday girl's missing kid. He does not have to punch a clock with his mother. We'll find him, Vivian. Screwing the help is inevitable. The police pulled a body from the inlet. We'd like you to come to the morgue. [♪]
