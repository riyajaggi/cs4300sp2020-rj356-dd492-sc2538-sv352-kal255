 [squeals] Musa, crank it up! Sonic blast! Tell your mom, tell your dad. Tell everybody you know. Winx Club Band on the beach tomorrow night! [cheering] [phones bleep] Live stream. Fire dragon! [cheering] Great show, you guys. I bet you could see it all across Gardenia. [Kiko squeaking] Here you go, Kiko. Carrot juice! [croaks excitedly] Yeah, thanks a lot for hosting it here, Roxy. It'll be a great way to spend my last day at the Frutti Music Bar. Last day? What? I got into Alfea! Roxy, that's wonderful! I couldn't have done it without you, Bloom. You were there for me. Just like a big sister. You've come a long way, Bloom. I couldn't have done it without you, Daphne. I think you could. But I will always try to help you, Bloom. I just wish I could do something for you... ...my big sister. Oh, Daphne. Bloom, are you okay? Fine. Let's get some air. [whimpers] [sighs] [Bloom gasping] What was that? Something's not right out there. [bleep] [whirring] - Look! - [bleep] [alarm sounding] She's in the red. We're pushing this rig too hard, boss. We got to make our quota. If we keep get going like this, there could be a spill. Let me worry about that. You just do your job, or I'll find someone who can. No leaks detected. You know, there are thousands of oil rigs operating on Earth's oceans. Well, at least we can keep an eye on this one. [whimpering] [sighs] Phew. What's up with you, Sky? And what's in the box? It's the Pendant of Eraklyon. Oh! Another royal trinket. No. It's more than that. Whenever a ruler of Eraklyon presents the pendant to his true love, they both have good luck and happiness together for the rest of their lives. I'm going to give it to Bloom. Oh? I see. I just don't want to lose it. Aisha, you put on quite the show. - Yeah! - That's right! Ladies, we have arrived! Hello, Sky. We were wondering where you were. Did you catch our show? [sighs] You got a haircut. Yeah. I see you're still going to the royal barber? What does that mean? You know, hats are in this year. [laughing] You guys! They're teasing. I think it looks great. [chattering] [squeaking] [disappointed squeaking] For you. Oh, Helia! I got this off your live feed. And for Princess Stella, something special. [Kiko squeaks disappointingly] [grumbling] How nice! Thank you, Brandon. [squeals] [coughing] - Carrot juice? - Carrot juice? Carrot juice! Sorry, sweetie. It's been such a wonderful summer. Don't you think? Yeah. I'm just sorry I had to spend so much of it on Eraklyon. That's okay. You are Crown Prince after all. My father's going to handle things while I get back to training at Red Fountain. No more "crown prince-ing" for me this year. Hey. What did you want to talk with me about? Oh, well, um... Bloom, um, well. You see, I wanted to-- Hey, Bloom! What do you think of this? [guitar riffing] Wow! [yelps] [gasps] [gasps] [groans] Is that for Bloom? - Yes. - You know... - Maybe I should I wait? - Yeah. Until it's just the two of you. [whimpers] Where's Aisha? Oh, Nabu. I miss you. [Flora] Hey! Here she is. [bleeping] Aisha, you okay? Fabulous, just waiting for Tressa to call me from the Coronation. It's today, right? Yup, today's the big day. Tressa's going to send me live video. We'll see everything as it happens! Oh, that's Tressa. I remember her. My uncle King Neptune, and my aunt Queen Ligea and the twins, my cousins Nereus and Tritannus. And man, are they gorgeous! Way cute! Well, at least that one. [Aisha] Nereus, totally, and a complete sweetie, but Tritannus, well, he's kind of a psycho. My Uncle Neptune will pick one of them today, to be the next king! Have we missed anything? Chillax, Timmy. It's not like you're going to getting crowned. Anyway, looks like you're right on time. Cousin Tressa! [Tressa] Cousin Aisha! Hey, guys! The ceremony's about to begin. [bubbling] Cousin Aisha! I'm so excited! Me too, Tressa! And we're all here! Hey there, Tressa! - Hello! - How's it going'? Hey, guys. Welcome to King Neptune's throne room! Things are just about to get started! I'm sure King Neptune will pick Nereus! He's so great and Tritannus is so not. [growls] Tritannus is so not? They'll be sorry, very sorry! Father, I can't find Tritannus anywhere. Then we must go forward without him. But Father-- He has made his choice, my son. And now, with or without your brother the coronation will begin. Citizens of the Oceans of Andros. Friends, family, the time has come for you to greet your next king. [excited laughter] By the power of the Oceans of Andros, by the might of our waves and by the strength of our currents... Here comes the best part! All hail Nereus. [all] Nereus! Nereus! Nereus! My son, come forward. I name you Nereus, Crown Prince and the next king of the Oceans of Andros. [screaming] What? Who dares attack the King? [screaming] Watch out! [shrieking] Princess Tressa! Tressa! - [exclaiming] - What happened? [screaming] Everybody! Stay calm! [grunting] [yelps] No! [groaning] [groaning] [clinking] Come on! [panting] Assassin! Guards! Stop him! [grunting] [grunts] - Traitor! - Tressa! No! Guard your brother. Everyone stand back! [grunting] You will not hurt my son! Your son? [grunting] Tritannus? [gasping] [all] Tritannus? [murmurs of disbelief] I am your son too, but you picked my brother. Because he will be a better king than you, Tritannus! For this I will destroy all of you! Just what I would expect of you. Take him to the prison of Andros. Lock him in a dungeon so deep he will never escape it. [gasping] What's going on? I'm not sure. Looks like there was some kind of disturbance.. Well, whatever is going on there, I'm sure King Neptune can handle it. Come on Tressa, pick up! Hey, Bloom. - [rumbling] - Whoa! What's going on? What was that? [man] Get outta there, she's going to blow! - [alarm blaring] - [screaming] Don't panic! Get to your boats! - [alarm blaring] - [groaning] Shut it down! Shut it down! [Bloom] Come on, you guys! It's coming from out there! Oil! Oil is spilling into the ocean! Oh, no! The oil rig. There are multiple pipeline ruptures. A large volume of oil is flowing into the water and the rig is on fire. Okay, Winx! We've got to rescue the workers on the rig and stop the spill. Flora, are you okay to go? Yes. We need to get out there. We'll back you up. Bloom, I want to go too. Sorry Roxy. I want you to stay here. I need you to look after the people on the beach. [all] Magic Winx Believix! ♪ [music playing] ♪ [Bloom] Bloom! Fairy of the Dragon Flame! ♪ [music playing] ♪ [Aisha] Aisha!

[grunting] [grunting] Thanks. But how do we get to that guy? It's all up to Aisha now! The lake. Morphix! [straining] [grunting] I'll take him, Aisha. The pipes underwater are leaking! We've got to stop it. We need to contain the oil and purify the water. We're going to have to converge. [Musa and Tecna] Purifying Wind! [Bloom and Aisha] Crystal Water! [Stella and Flora] Green Burst! [all] Winx Convergence! Nice work, Winx! And it's all green technology! [Flora] A natural water filter. [Tecna] Powered by solar and wind energy! But we didn't get it all. There's a plume of oil underwater spreading out into the ocean. Yes, but we've done all we can do for now. We've got to get the workers to safety. Oh, Kiko! [squealing] We came as soon as we heard on the news. We did so much but it still wasn't enough. [Sky] I lost it. [Tecna] The oil from this spill could pollute thousands of miles of ocean. [Bloom] But now magic is back on Earth and in its oceans. [Stella] So pollution and magic could mix? Sounds like big trouble. Mike, do you think the oil from the spill will wash up on our beach? It might, honey. I've got an idea! Why don't we make tomorrow's concert a benefit, to preserve the Earth's oceans and Gardenia's beaches? - Oh, cool! - Yeah! [shouts of agreement] Put him in the cell next to those troublemakers from Magix. [grunts] [woman 1] Tritannus, right? We've heard of you. [woman 2] You are the one who tried to take the title of crown prince from his own brother. [woman 3] We like you already. Who are you? Tell me. [evil laughter] [all] We are the Trix! [evil laughter] [voiceover] In the prison of Andros, Tritannus absorbs toxic pollution and becomes a horrible monster. With the Trix, he heads to Earth to find more pollution and become even more powerful. Will the Winx succeed in foiling his plan? ♪ [music playing] ♪
