 BLOOM'S MOM (OFFSCREEN):  Wake up, sleepy head. The sun's been up for ages. BLOOM (OFFSCREEN): Oh. Oh, five more minutes, Mom? -You're late, Bloom. -School! Oh, no! Ugh! Why didn't you wake  me up before? Oh, the alarm didn't go off. Oh, no! Ugh! Ugh! I can't believe this! Ugh! Hang on a sec. School's out. The alarm didn't go off, because  I'm on vacation. Oh, Mom. You're joke is not funny. -Bloom, uh, huh. But you fell for  it, didn't you? Ha, ha. -I'm sleepy. I'm going back to bed. -You should try to bed  earlier, you know? You were up really  late last night. BLOOM (OFFSCREEN):  I was reading. -Fairies-- Myth or Reality. Ugh! Don't you ever get tired  of these silly things? -They're not silly, OK? -Huh! Actually, now that school  is over, you can help me in the shop. BLOOM (OFFSCREEN): No! -Good morning, sunshine. -I'm not going to spend my summer working in the shop. I wish I could go somewhere  fun with my friends. -When you're older, you can  go wherever you want. -How old is older? I'm already 16, Dad. -Only 16. You are still my little girl. BLOOM (OFFSCREEN): Dad,  it's not fair! -Listen, in a few weeks, we'll all be going to the beach like we do every year. -But all my friends go on  holidays by themselves. That would've been the  best present ever. -Well, speaking of presents,  we've got a little surprise for you. -Yeah. Just a little something to help  you get around Gardenia. [gasp] -Really? Thanks, Dad! [squeaking] -Huh? -Nice, huh? -Uh, well, yeah. Thanks. BLOOM'S DAD (OFFSCREEN): See, she doesn't know what to say. -I don't know? Maybe she was expecting  something a bit more sophisticated. -A bicycle with a speedometer,  maybe. BLOOM'S MOM (OFFSCREEN):  A scooter, Mike. -But scooters are dangerous  and they cost a bundle. -We'll try to put some  money aside. Maybe next year we  can get her one. -Ugh! He'll never change. My dad will never let  me ride anything faster than a bicycle. MITSY (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Bloom. -Huh? -Vacationing in Gardenia  this year? -No. Actually, we'll be going  away, very soon. -The same old beach, huh? I'll send you a postcard from  our vacation place. That will give you a chance  to something-- [blowing raspberries] MITSY (OFFSCREEN): Hey, careful  with that scooter. It's brand new, you know. -Have a nice summer, Mitsy. See you at school. What a showoff. Go on, Kiko, but stick  around, all right? -Agh! Ooh! [chattering] -What's the matter, Kiko? [chattering] -What? -Up! -Hiya! Hiya! Ahh, rising sun! -Wow! Hiya! Ugh! -Goodness, did you  see that, Kiko? -Oh, ooh! -Solar wind! [growling] -Go away, you villain, or you will feel the magic of the sun and moon fairy! [growling] [roaring] [grunting] -Agh! -Oh, my goodness! [growling] -Agh! Your time's up, fairy. -Good heavens! -Ghoulies, take the scepter! [growling] Wah! -My scepter. -Ah, gave me that scepter. -No! -Hm, not so brave  now, are you? BLOOM (OFFSCREEN): Let her go! -Huh? Hm? -Or else I'll, wait! What am I going to do? [growling] [gasp] -Get her! [growling] -Get back! -Ahh! -Huh? Did-- did I just do that? [cowering] -Oo-wah? Ya-ha! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. -He-ey! -Huh? oh, ah! -Hands off Kiko! Hiya! -Ooh! [gasp] -Come here, or I'll smash  you like a china doll! -Ugh! Oh, no! [screaming] -Wow! Powerful! [moaning] -Are you OK? -Well, yeah. [growling] -I have my scepter back. You don't scare me anymore. -Agh! Ugh! -Only returning the compliment,  Your Beast. [growling] -Watch out! -Dah! [snarling] -Ha! Hm, yah! [growling] -Agh! -Hm, we'll meet again,  Blondie. -Thank goodness, they're  gone at last! [gasp] -Ugh! -Hey, are you all right? Answer me. We'd better go home now, Kiko. This girl needs help. Knut! Come forward. So you have failed. -Not my fault, Your Highness. I had the scepter in my hands,  but then this earthly girl appears and messes  everything up. -An earthling girl? -Oh, but she was not your  ordinary earthling. She's got power, this girl. She pushed back to my ghouls,  just like that. Interesting. Describe her. -Well, let's see. She was, uh-- Knut, you glasses,  where are they? -Uh, right here, Highness. Well, put them on you dolt! A nearsighted ogre,  how ridiculous! If only he'd wear his glasses,  he'd be all right. Oh, will you stop  defending him? -And ogre with glasses  looks kind of lame. Quiet! That girl could mean  something to us. -Oh, but, Highness,  don't worry. One of my ghouls grabbed this. It's a piece of that  girl's clothing. To us, this is nothing. But to a hunting troll, it's  an important clue. You see? Good. And go back to Gardenia and find out the girl. And this time-- Don't let us down! BLOOM'S DAD (OFFSCREEN):  Bloom, I'm not sure I understand. Could you run that  by me again? -I already told you. She was attacked by some  horrible creatures. She's some kind of fairy. -Hm? I see. -You believe me, then? -No, I don't. I think we should call  the police and take this girl to a hospital. -N-no, please. Don't tell anyone. -She's coming to. How you feel dear? -Huh? I'm all right. Thanks for helping me out. -Oh, it was nothing. -My name is Stella. -Hi, Stella. My name is Bloom. -Should we call your  parents, Stella? -Um, that would be difficult. I come from a place that's  a bit far from here. Have you heard of Solaria? It's a kingdom far, far away. -Hm? STELLA (OFFSCREEN): I'm  a fairy, you know. I was trying to get to Alfea Castle, in the realm of magic. So I-- -Oh, but of course! I'm calling the police. It doesn't take a genius to  realize that this girl is seriously out of her mind. [growling] -Hmm! -Huh? -All right. Do you believe me now? -I saw her, and I believe her. -Those creatures attacked me and  I was forced to land here, on your planet. Your daughter saved my life. She pushed back the ghouls  with an energy shield. -Actually, I don't know  how I did it. -A fairy doesn't need  to know how. She just does it, that's all. -I'm a-- a fairy? -Of course you are. Don't tell me you're not. Have you registered for the new  program at Alfea Castle? It's the best school for young  fairies like you and me. No! Stop talking nonsense, please! -Ah, here we are! Troll, do your thing! [growling] [sniffing] KNUT (OFFSCREEN):  Find that girl! [growling] TROLL (OFFSCREEN): This way! -So, this is your room, huh? Wow! Did you draw these? BLOOM (OFFSCREEN): Yes. -They're amazing! Sorry, I'm a bit nosey. -Oh, no. It's OK, Stella. I mean-- -Huh? -No, things are not OK. For instance, I still don't  understand what happened in the park. -Bloom, you used your  powers to save me. You should be proud  of yourself. In my world, magic is  a part of life. And powers, such as yours,  are perfectly normal. -Is your world like that? -Hm? -Is it? -Yes, almost. But it's much nicer in here. It's so different. -I guess it all depends on your  point of view, Stella. I still can't get over  what happened. -Strong feelings, such as fear,  have summoned up the wonderful powers that  are in you. They were always there, you  just didn't know it. It's just a question  of concentration. With your energy, you  could do anything. Watch! OK, now it's your turn. Give them back their  original shape. -Oh! STELLA (OFFSCREEN): Well? -Nothing. I can't do it. -You should come with  me to Alfea Castle. It's a school for fairies. A new session is  about to start. You could learn to control  your powers. And I'm sure you would make  an excellent fairy. -Where is Alfea? -It's in the enchanted  realm of Magix. A place beyond time and space,  where everything is possible. If you want to see the school,  I'll show it to you. This is a bottomless postcard. Watch this. Magic! Now follow me! [gasp] [sniffing] TROLL (OFFSCREEN):  She's not far. The smell is strong. There's another fairy. -It's Stella. They're together. -I just jump in like you? Whoa! STELLA (OFFSCREEN): Yes. Hurry up before the  gate closes. [sniffing] -I've lost the scent. She's disappeared. BLOOM'S DAD (OFFSCREEN): Huh! Fairies! It's totally ridiculous. -Huh? -Huh! -Mike, it's not ridiculous. It's true. Come on, admit it! You and I both know that Stella  is a real fairy, but you're afraid to believe it. Mike, if this is Bloom's  true nature, who are we to stop her? -This is Alfea Castle. Nice, huh? I'm sure you'd like it here. -But what about my high  school in Gardenia? I mean, everything is  happening so fast. -Well let them think about it. I've got to leave tomorrow morning, with or without you. -All right. I'll sleep on it. Now how do we get out of here? -Easy, all you got  to do is jump up. Whee! -Ugh! Ah! -Wait a minute! -Huh? -The scent is back. They're in this house. -Good work, Troll. They can't escape us now. We'll go in through the back door and take the whole happy family by surprise. [squeaking] -Huh? Agh! Agh! -What's wrong, Kiko? We'll play later, OK? We're really busy right now. [thumping] -What? [chattering] -Hungry again? You just had your dinner. You're going to have  to wait a bit. [squeaking] [thumping] [grunting] -Oh! Aha! Yah! -Huh? What is that rabbit doing,  trashing the kitchen? Kiko, come here, immediately! [growling] -Agh! Agh! [roaring] [gasps] -No! [growling] [snarling] [cowering] -Those girls must be around  here somewhere. STELLA (OFFSCREEN): We're  right behind you! -Hm? What? -Now let's settle this! -Solaria! THEME SONG: Stella,  Stella, Stella. Ring of Light, its magic  lies inside. I got power, I've a ring! -Huah, hiya! -Oof! -You dummy. You got beat by a  cutsie blonde. -Hm, yes, but I'm no  ordinary blonde. Bloom, we're outnumbered. We're going to have  to split them up. -I have an idea. I'll take care of the ghouls. [snarling] -All right, Blondie. Want to see what me and  the Troll can do? If I were you, I'd get ready  to like my wounds. No what I mean? -Very well. Let's see what you two can do against that, burning power. -Ah, Now what do I do? -Uh, but-- [cowering] STELLA (OFFSCREEN): Burning,  fool them. -Ooh! -Wow, Stella sure knows how  to command respect. -Oh! Ugh! -Stella! -And Bloom! Don't worry, I've called  the specialists. -Uh, who? [growling] -With the racket, I can't  hear a thing. Huh! [gasps] -Ugh! [growling] -Guys, I'm ready. -OK let's take him to jail,  where he belongs. -What's the rush? Don't want to have a little  bit of fun, first? -I wouldn't be so cocky,  if I were you. After all, this only  our first mission. -Yeow! -I rest my case. -Agh! [growling] -Stay behind me. -Ugh! Hiya! -Sky, would you mind  doing something? -What? Hiya! -My turn. Ah, ah, ah. -Whoa! -Bullseye! -Yeah, well done. But it's not over yet. -Girls. -Huh? -Huh? -OK, who wants to feel  my blade, huh? Hah! Ugh! Ugh! [grunting] -See, I told you could do it. -Then I'm really a fairy? -Of course you are. I'm never wrong. [growling] [gasps] -Oh, drats! -Finally! This one's over. Bloom, meet our four heroes. -Huh? STELLA (OFFSCREEN):  Riven Prince Sky. -Hey. STELLA (OFFSCREEN): Timmy. -Hee. -And Brandon, Prince  Sky's squire. -Hello. -Ugh. Ugh. TIMMY (OFFSCREEN): Hey  you, where do you think you're going? [whimpering] -Hm? -See you later! [gasp] -You know, it would be easy  for me to straighten up everything with a  little magic. -Thanks, but I prefer  this way. BLOOM'S MOM (OFFSCREEN):  Bloom's ready. -You're sure about  this, sweetie? -Yes, Dad. I'm going with Stella to the  realm of Magix and Alfea Castle. -Call us as soon as you get  there and let us know everything. I still can't believe  we agreed to this. What if you get sick? What if you meet these  monsters again? Wh--what if-- BLOOM (OFFSCREEN): Dad, I'll  be careful, I promise. [squeaking] -Bloom. we love you,  very much. And please come home as soon  as the session is over the next summer. We'll miss you. -And I'll miss you  both, so much. -Uh, uh, uh! Did you really think we'd let  you go, just like that? No, no. We're coming with you. -Really? Wow, thanks, Dad! This is so great. -Ah, no sweat. And anyway, I really want to see this famous magic dimension you keep  talking about. So-- -Stella, is it possible? -Hm, well, the rules  don't allow it. But as they say, rules are  made to be broken. Are you ready? BLOOM'S DAD (OFFSCREEN):  We were born ready. -To Magix we go! [screaming] -Oh! -Ugh! Ow! Wow! It really does exist. -You believe us now? -Come on, we got to go. Classes are about to begin. NARRATOR: In the next episode, at Alfea Bloom will discover a new life and amazing  new friends.
