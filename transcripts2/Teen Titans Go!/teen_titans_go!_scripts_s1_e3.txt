 1x05 - Double Trouble Let me out! It stinks in here! You lose again, Chrome Dome! I hate this game. Can we please do something else? Sorry, dude. It's my turn to choose and I wanna play Cavemen and Dinosaurs. Easy for you to say. I don't wanna get eaten anymore. Then you better start running. Because you've got 30 seconds! One mesozoic, two mesozoic, three mesozoic...

 I don't want to... I don't want any more... - Hi! - Dare I even ask? I'm hiding from Beast Boy so I don't have to play Cavemen and Dinosaurs. Uh-huh. Could you hand me the toothpaste? Oh, yeah! Sure! Look, you got to help me. This game is going to be the death of me. Sorry, I've got better things to do. Like restock the toothpaste. Azarath metrion zinthos! Wish you could make two of me, then I wouldn't have to play... - Wait a second! - No! Oh, come on, Raven. Please! Please! Please! Please... What is all the lo-commotion about? Cyborg wants me to create a magical double of him. And then, I can make him play with Beast Boy.

 Magic is a powerful tool, not to be used for petty reasons. Hmm! Then could you at least duplicate this last slice of pizza so I can drown my sorrows in food? Fine. Azarath metrion zinthos! - Booya! - Booya! Oh, brother! Whoa! What? Beast Boy, allow me to introduce you to myself, Cyborg. - He's an exact replica of me. - What's up, beast man? Exact replica, huh? I'll be the judge of that! What's your favorite food? Pizza. Duh. What's your favorite video game? Invasion of the Bubblebots 2. Who would win a fight, a ninja or a merman? Neither. Being natural allies, they would team up to defeat the evil kung fu bird-people. You are an exact replica of Cyborg! Huh! - Do you like dinosaurs? - Uh, yeah! Awesome! Ha! It worked! Why? ♪ 'Cause I'm a genius! Yes, I'm a genius! ♪ ♪ I am a genie in a bottle. I'm a genius! ♪ Finally, I can relax! Okay, I'm bored. Oh, man, you stink! I thought you were good at this game, dude. So did I! I thought I was, but I'm just awful. I thought you guys were playing Cavemen and Dinosaurs. We got sick of it. So now we're playing Invasion of the Bubblebots 2. Ooh, cool! Can I play? Sorry, bro. We only have two controllers. - Yeah. Sorry, bro. - That's okay. I didn't feel like playing my favorite video game in the whole wide world anyway. - What is it? - Oh, it's just... Beast Boy and my double are, like, best friends now. And you want sympathy from me? - You are the one who cast the spell. - You tricked me into casting it. It's your fault you lost your best friend. - What? - Well, since I need a new best friend, I thought maybe you could make a magical double of Beast Boy. - You're unbelievable. - Okay! Then could you at least duplicate this controller so I can play video games with them? Fine. Azarath metrion zinthos! Psyche! Hey, what's up? - You're me! - Correction. I'm you. - Awesome! - Awesome! You've got to be kidding me. This is great! Now, I have a new best friend. Right, Beast Boy? Whoa! You're a magical double? Just like me? - Wanna be best friends? - Okay. No! Wait! We're supposed to be best friends! Sorry, Cyborg. I just have more in common with Cyborg. Later. But... ohh! Good going, Cy! Now, neither one of us has a best friend. Perhaps the two of you could just be best friends again. This guy? - As if. - Not. - Wanna get something to eat? - Sure! So, there are four of them now, huh? - I don't wanna talk about it. - I'm starving. I left a big bag of tofu chips right here on the... table. Looks like someone beat us to it. Don't worry. We've still got a tub of ice... Crud! Thanks for the snacks. You're the best! The worst part is, they put the tub back in the freezer even though it's empty! - I mean, who does that? - Us, apparently. Forget the snacks. We'll just play some video games. All yours. Aw, man! You busted the controller! And this one's covered in ice-cream! Ew! I mean, mmm! Are we really that annoying? - In a word, yes. - Now you know how we feel. Now, then... All in favor of kicking the magical doubles out of Titans Tower and letting them fend for themselves on the mean streets of Jump City, raise your hand. All opposed? - Looks like you lose. - Look again, bro. No way! I didn't do it. We found Raven's spell book and figured out how to cast the spell ourselves. All in favor of kicking out every non-magical double? I'll actually kind of miss that place. We shared lots of good memories there. We sure... Wait! I don't really have any memories in the tower. Me neither. Come to think of it, I don't remember a single thing before a couple of months ago. - How could that be? - Unless... So you're saying you think Beast Boy and me are magical doubles, too? Yup. I checked Cyborg's credit card statement and tracked his pizza deliveries to this apartment. Then the real deal should be in there! Help me! Help me! I'm dying! Titans, go! Help me. Help me. I'm dying. You've got five lives left, man. No big deal. Do you mind explaining yourselves? Sure, just let us clear this level. Now! Okay! Sheesh! We found Raven's spell book and figured out how to duplicate ourselves. So, yeah, we decided to take a little vay-cay, and let our doubles take our place, man. All of this time we have been living with magical doubles? Yup. Well, thanks to you two clowns, the tower is now overrun with doubles! We thought that might happen. Which is why we have a contingency plan. So, what is to become of these two magical doubles? Don't worry about us, we've seen the error of our ways, and we're committed to becoming better people. We're gonna be hobos! "Ride the rails," that sort of thing. So long, Titans! Wait! Can't you take these two with you? Dude... I ain't getting up. I don't think I can get up. Well, I guess that is all wrapped up. So, where did you send all of those doubles to? I hate this game! 1x06 - The Date Two, three, four, five. Yes! Two, three, four, five. Yes! Knew it! - Ooh, what you got? - Uh, nothing. - What you got? - Nothing. - What you got? - Nothing! What you got? Yoink! - Come on, guys. That's mine. - So, what is it? It's one of those fortune-teller games that the little kids play. Ha, ha! Robin plays baby games! Okay, yup. I'm a big baby. Can I have it back now? - No way. - Not till we know our fortune! You first, beasty. Pick a color. - You know my color, bro! - G-r-e-e-e-e-n. What's my fortune? What's my fortune? Please be "millionaire." "You will... marry Starfire?" Well, it doesn't mean I won't be a millionaire. - Now can I get it back? - Nope! My turn! B-l-u-e. And my fortune is... "you and Starfire will have seven kids." What? That's gonna be awkward since I'm already marrying her. These are strangely Starfire-specific fortunes. It's because the fortunes are for me. - Oh! - Ooh! Starfire does make you act a little nuts, doesn't she? There was something about Starfire that made him nuts. Not the kind of nuts that put a knot in your stomach or made you want to climb a mountaintop to shout out your feelings. No, the nuts that made you hear voices in your head, voices like mine. There's this new restaurant opening tonight that she wants to try, but I don't know how to ask. - We can help you! - Really? Me and Cyborg have asked out tons of girls. - And they went out with you? - No. - Of course not. - But we asked! So, sit right there and learn from the masters. Please! Just go out with me! If you say no, I don't know if I could take it anymore! Please! Please! Please! Think this is the wrong approach? - Oh, please don't say no! - I already love you though. Just be yourself. Just go out with me! Hi, Starfire. Hey, Starfire. Hey, Starfire. Hola, Starfire! No! Enter! Yes, Robin? Uh... Is this a game? Thank you, Robin. Your game was most enjoyable. Uh, yes. Good times, huh? Wait! Star, there... There was something else. You know, that new restaurant is opening tonight, uh, I thought maybe you'd like to go. I would love to! - You would? - Indeed! But I cannot. Speedy has already asked me to go with him. - Speedy? - How's it going, Robin? Speedy! Speedy had always been the chief rival of Robin. First as a sidekick, then a hero, And now for the affections of a strange but endearing alien princess. At that moment, Robin knew he would do anything in his power to stop Speedy from winning over Starfire. Even though reason said he should be more concerned with the voice he kept hearing in his head. This guy? Are you kidding? How can you stand to look at that face? - I'm standing right here. - Ugh! Not to mention that voice! I have always felt you two share many visual and auditory similarities. Don't you get it, Star? He's all wrong for you! Is that not the purpose of the date? To find out if one is compatible? - Whoa! What's wrong? - Speedy already asked her! - Oh, bummer, dude. - It's okay. Are you sure you're okay? You have that look again. I have a plan. - Why is Speedy tied to a chair? - And in his underwear. Speedy has a date with Starfire tonight, and I'm going to keep it. Something tells me he's about to blow any chance he has with Starfire forever! Just keep an eye on him for me, okay? Sorry, dude. We would never do something like this. Would you do it for a Scooby Snack? - Done and done! - Oh, yeah! What am I doing? Tying Speedy up, taking his place? I can't go through with this. Finally, Robin had come to his senses. Though Starfire was his dream, he could not compromise his conscience. Hello, Speedy. Yup! That's me! I'm Speedy! - Have a seat! - Why, thank you, Speedy! I find your being a gentleman compatible with several traits I possess. Ha! Never gets old! Okay, very funny, guys! - Come on, let me go. - No. - No. - Let me go! - No. - No. - Let me go! - No. - No. - Let me go! - Sorry, dude. Not till after the date. - Okay. - Thank you. - Let me go. - No. - No. - Let me go. - No. - No. - Let me go! - No. - No. - Let me go! - No. - No. - Let me go! - No. - No. - Let me go! - No. - No. - Let me go! - Oh! Kidnapping is so boring! - You wanna get something to eat? - What about him? - Let me go! - No. - No. Hey, Rave. Will you watch Speedy for us? - Like a hawk. - You're the best! Exit's the other way. Is this really necessary, Speedy? Totally! This is what I do on all of my dates! Oh! Score! I am beginning to wish I declined your invitation tonight in favor of Robin's. Wait, but I thought you said Robin and I were basically the same. I was factually incorrect. You have nothing in common with Robin! - Goodbye, Speedy. - Yes! - No! - Robin, what are you doing here? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. It's time you learned the... Excuse me. I used to think your staff was lame, but this is kinda fun! I'll take these. Are you okay, Robin? Speedy has been acting quite strangely. Yeah. I think he's a little... You know? He's not the one who's hearing voices. Don't make me come in there! I learned something important today, Robin. Perhaps I have taken you for granted. You are the kindest, most honest... Robin had finally won Starfire over, but at what cost, he wondered. Yes, Robin was ashamed of the way he acted, but deep down, there was still a good person. He knew if he were to live with himself tomorrow he'd have to come clean today. So he did. He told her everything. And hearing his actions out of his own mouth only made him feel worse. His actions were just terrible! Terrible! You probably hate me, don't you? - Robin, you did all that for me? - I did! Does that mean you're... You are out of your gourd! That's what I've been trying to tell him. - Huh? - I don't believe we've met. I'm the voice in Robin's head. - And I am... - Absolutely stunning! It is nice to meet you, disembodied voice. What do you say you and me get out of here? I would like that. After you, my dear. And what started as a chance encounter between a voice and a girl, would soon blossom into the most wonderful... Are you coming? Uh, sorry. Be right there.
