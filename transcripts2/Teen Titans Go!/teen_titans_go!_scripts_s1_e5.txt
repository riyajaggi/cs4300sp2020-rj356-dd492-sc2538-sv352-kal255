 1x09 - Ghost Boy Nice try, Beast Boy. Aw! If you're regurgitating owl pellets into my cereal again, I am not amused. Aw! - Your wit never gets old. - Aw! You guys are no fun! We're sick of you playing pranks on us all the time. And we're not gullible enough to fall for them anyway. Then it's a good thing there's a Titan who is.

 I can always count on Starfire. I'm gonna scare her good. Please, desist. Stop it! You will not take my blood, evil vampire bug! - Ow! - Beast Boy? Is that you in the form of a mosquito? Yes. Ow, you got me. Oh! Hang on to your life force, I will get help for you, friend. No! It's too late. Oh. I'm a goner. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye!

 By the Moons of Zenoglurb, I have killed Beast Boy. Boo! Beast Boy? You... you are a ghost! A ghost? Yeah. Yeah! I'm a ghost. Ah! Help! I think this might be the start of something beautiful. Robin, Raven, Cyborg? I have some particularly bad tidings to share. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shh! - I bid you not to tell them. - You bid me? Yeah! See, here on Earth, if you accidently kill someone, it's customary to do whatever the ghost says. I see. In that case, I'm at your service. What noble tasks shall you assign to me? How do I know which clothes are dirty and which one should go back in the closets? Sniff test. Just hold it up to your nose and sniff. Is it necessary to conduct this test upon all of your clothing? Only the ones on the floor. As you wish. Uh-oh! Someone's coming. Starfire, why are you sniffing Beast Boy's clothes? - The truth is... - Shh! The truth is on my planet sniffing dirty clothes is good luck. Oh! How I enjoy this! So lucky. I told Robin an untruth and it makes me feel dirty. Speaking of dirty... sniff. Sniff. If you are a ghost. Why did you hide under the bed? Could you not have just flown through a wall? Here on Earth, you need to be a ghost for a few days before you can fly through stuff. One more thing... It's been six hours since Beast Boy tried to play a prank on us. - What do you think he's up to? - Probably no good. - You look awful. What's the matter? - I cannot tell you because I have been sworn to secrecy by a ghost. - By a ghost, huh? - Let me guess. This ghost likes to eat tofu and play video games? I think Beast Boy is playing a prank on you. What? Clorbag Valblernek! I'd say it's time we gave Beast Boy a taste of his own medicine. Whew! Must've overslept. I feel stiff. Hey, what's going on? He was so young! Indeed. It is not fair! I'm gonna miss you my Beasty little buddy! At least he's in a better place now. Better place? Hello? I'm right here. I still can't believe he was struck in his sleep by a meteor. Very funny! I see what's going on! You guys are trying to play a prank on me. Did you hear something? Okay, if I really was a ghost. Would I be able to do this? Well, I just got a chill up my spine. Oh no! I really am a ghost! Whoa! He fell for it. Hock light and weighty object. And putting that spell of transparency on him, brilliant, Raven! Quiet! He's coming back. Hold up. I'm a ghost. This means I can finally do what I always wanted to do more than anything. - Jump into a volcano. - Jump into a volcano? - What kind of dream is that? - Awesome! Wait, Beast Boy! - Um, how long would that spell last? - Not long enough. Then we have to stop him before he really does become a ghost. Titans go! Be careful team. Volcanoes are super dangerous. We're going to have to find Beast Boy, before he gets to the top. Look, over there. Clearly, that's Beast Boy in the form of a mountain lion. - Yo! Beast dude! - Ah! I don't think that's... I was mistaken. Definitely not Beast Boy. - Are you okay? - Yeah! Just a few minor scrapes and... Oh, my arm. Oh no! Cyborg, you are a ghost? - The irony. - We can't let this stop us Titans. We must keep going on to rescue Beast Boy. Well, this footing is treacherous. As an acrobatics' expert, I have nothing to... I got him. I got him. Don't got him. Robin! Guys, check it out! I can fly. I finally have a super power. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Yes! Careful, there is still many dangers on this volcano. - Falling rocks, lava flows... - Laser beams. Laser what... Where did that even come from? On my planet, it is not uncommon to be struck down by a stray laser beam from outer space. We have to keep moving. Beast Boy needs us. I'm beginning to think that we're paying to high a price to save Beast Boy. No price is ever too high when it comes to doing what is right. Easy for you to say. You're still alive. Why does it appear the top is coming to us? Rock slide! - Oh, right, we're ghosts. - Starfire! As you can see Robin, rock slides are of no concern to me. Rebbel nibbits! Well, now that we are all ghosts, we might as well just fly through the volcano. Oh, no! The spell's worn off. One, two... - Beast Boy! Stop! - You are not really a ghost. Ha, ha! Got you guys! I wasn't going to jump. I knew you guys were pranking me the whole time. We all just died trying to save you. Ah! I am so angry. I could push you. But you can't! 'Cause you're a ghost. Well, that was fun! Now look who's a ghost. This is not funny! You are right. It is not funny! It is hilarious! So... what now?
