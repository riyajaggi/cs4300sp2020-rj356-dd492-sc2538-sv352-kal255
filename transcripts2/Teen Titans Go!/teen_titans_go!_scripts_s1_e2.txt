 Everything's half off at the dollar store! Man, all week you've been bumming rides for stupid stuff. You know you messed up my weekly backup, right? You're lucky I didn't lose any important data. I must agree with Cyborg. It is most irritating. Thank you. Who's that orange girl? Why can't you just drive yourself, dude? Uh... my... My license was suspended. - What? - Yeah. I was in a little fender bender. No, no, no, no. You don't need to come down. It's just a scratch. So, you destroyed the Batmobile. You did not. Ah, you in trouble. It is enjoyable to laugh at someone else's misfortune. Anyways, I found a guy on the internet. He says he'll get my license back, no problemo. - Sounds kinda sketchy, Robin. - It's on the level. Besides, how can I not pass? I am a master driver. Well, this is where the driving instructor told me to meet. "Get in. Start engine." Okay. My name is Ed. I'll be your driving instructor. Ed, as in "Driver's Ed"? Just Ed. The way this works is that every time you fail to comply with an instruction, I make a deduction. - Too many deductions, you fail. - Hey, what's that noise? Is that... Pull out into traffic and proceed through the intersection. - But what about the... - And that's a deduction. Okay. Right, right. I'm going. - I swear, that sounds like... - Eyes front. - Sorry. - That's a deduction. Left here. - No signal, another deduction. - Oh, man. - Increase your speed. - If you say so. Now turn right. - Are you sure? - Deduction. Left. Deduction, hard right. Turn right. - But there's no... - Two deductions. Hard right. I think we're finished here. So, how did I do? So, you failed your driver's test? Whoo! Master driver, huh? Laughing at your shortcomings makes us all feel better about ourselves. It is okay, Robin. A lot of people fail the test of driving. Will someone please tell me who that strange woman is? Look, I'm a great driver. I'm just not a great test-taker. L, R, alligator and blurry spot. The good thing is I can keep re-taking the test until I pass. And I will pass. Because I am a master driver. - He is gonna fail, isn't he? - Big time. So, last time I think you freaked me out a little, but now I'm ready. Did you hear that? - It sounds like... - That's going to be a... Okay, okay. No deductions. This music is terrible. That's a deduction. Only three seconds in the air, deduction. I asked you to turn down the cereal aisle. I know, that's a deduction. Meet me for a re-take in front of the casino. By the money factory. At the end of the rainbow. How about you just tell me who you are? We went to school together, right? You look a lot like my cousin. Did we eat at the same restaurant the other night? Hey, is that Robin? Huh. He's supposed to be meeting his driver's ed instructor. I don't know why he's in front of a jewelry store. Looks like it's because he is the getaway driver. Surely Robin is not aware he is aiding and abetting a criminal. Well, that's why we've got to warn him... whoever you are. What are they doing here? Oh, they're here to laugh at me. "No superpowers and can't drive," I bet that's what they're saying. - I'll show them. - Make a right here. Stow it, Ed. I've got this one. Nice driving, Cyborg. Hey, when did Starfire get here? - You pass. - Yes! But only because I never want you as a getaway driver again. I was using you the whole time and you couldn't see it. Nope, I knew. That's why I'm not warning you about the demon. That's right. Master driver. 1x04 - Dog Hand Oh. Have you witnessed Raven's mood? It appears to be un-good. Yeah, she's been like that for the last few days. Shh. Here she comes. Okay, Raven, what's bugging you, you know, uh, more than usual? - Don't wanna talk about it. - Come on, sing, little birdie. I said I don't want to talk about it. And I can totally respect that. - Raven? - Fine. I'll tell you. My father is coming here for a visit. Oh, no? You don't understand. He's not your typical dad. I can relate. I mean, I am half robot, after all. Catch, daddy, catch. It's just... I had a lot of issues growing up. Who had childhood issues, ahem? Excuse me, but are you my mother? Okay. Okay, thanks anyway. Uh, are you my mother? Are you my mother? Are you my mother? Look, my father, Trigon, is... - Trigon? - Trigon? Trigon. Devourer of a million souls. Conqueror of countless worlds. Trigon is one of the most powerful beings in the entire universe. He is your father? Yep, my dad is literally a demon who feeds off the suffering of others. Especially me. Behold Trigon, Master of the dark, Destroyer of dimensions, Enslaver of civilizations. Enough with the resume, dad. Hi, I'm Raven's father. You must be Cyborg. Is that an upgraded optical sensor? Uh, yeah. Thanks for noticing, all powerful Trigon, sir. Greetings, I am Starfire, your daughter's best female friend within the Teen Titans. Young lady, these pale in comparison to your beauty. Aww. And the party animal himself, Beast Boy. Guilty. No introduction needed, boy wonder. The honor is mine. - How is your back? - It's fine. Why? Thought it might be sore from carrying Batman all these years. Why are you here, dad? To see my only daughter and her friends, of course. And now you have. Goodbye. Raven. That was harsh, man, even for her. Yeah, I mean, her dad didn't seem that bad. There's something called knocking, dad. This place is a pigsty. How do you live like this? So I was thinking, maybe tonight we can take your friends for some pizza. - My treat. - Not interested. You know, I wish you could at least pretend to be happy to see your dad. How could I when I know the real reason you're here is to lecture me about not living up to my potential? When you said you wanted to be a hero, did I stop you? No. I figured it would be great for you to save some lives and get it out of your system. But let's face it, you're wasting your powers here, Raven. - When I was your age... - Oh, here it comes. I had already enslaved my first dimension. When was the last time you even tried to torment a species for no reason, huh? Huh, huh? I didn't ask to be a demon spawn, you know. So just leave me alone. Where did I go wrong? Raven's not much of a conversationalist, is she? Hmm, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye-to-eye. Yeah, I irritate the snot out of her, too. She must have a thing against powerful men, you know? I mean, who wouldn't want a father who could grant any power? Whoa. Did you say, "any power"? Seriously, you have no idea what a wiener my dad can be. Dude, you got it twisted. Your old man's straight up the bomb. Why are you talking like that? How are you talking like that? Your dad gave her the power to speak like an Earth teen. And he gave me the power to turn into anything I want. Look! - And yet you choose to be a bean bag. - Now I can veg out on myself. LOL. Whoo! What's up, Rave? My dad's got princess starry-eyes and the beast brain thinking he's the greatest thing since toilet paper. Glad you and Robin aren't so gullible. Where is Robin anyway? Notice anything different, Raven? - You're twitching. - Yep, pretty awesome, huh? What, you didn't want a power from my dad? Of course I did. He gave me a dog for a hand. Quit it! Quit it! I love you so much, dog-hand. I just... love you so much. - Ugh, he got to you too, Silkie? - What's the haps, players? - You need to stop talking. - Haters gonna hate. Raven, you've got Trigon all wrong. He's a great dad. - Straight-up, awesome! - Holla! His breath smells like a fireplace. - What is wrong with you guys? - What's wrong with you? Trigon said that you could have been granting powers for us all along. Easy, boy. Easy. Instead of fighting your dad, maybe you should try to be more like him. You're right. It's time I became the daughter my dad always wanted me to be. After thinking about what you said, dad, I'm ready to embrace my inner demon. That's my little tyrant. Just three easy steps. First, draw your power from the terror of every Earth-child's nightmares. Easy-cheesy, Rave, you can do it. Now, focus that power, and open an inter-dimensional portal. - Way to go, Raven. - Bravo. I'm so proud. The only thing left to do is kill all your friends. Kill us, kill us. You can, like, totally do it. Yeah. Wait, what? I'd like to first make an example out of one. I suggest Beast Boy. To force the others to swear their allegiance, then eradicate them anyway. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not cool. Nothing personal. Just the last step in becoming truly demonic. Go ahead and annihilate them, dear. Then we can get ice cream to celebrate. So, still want me to be... more like him? - No. Uh-uh. - No. Uh-uh. That's what I thought. Sorry, dad. Looks like I'm going to flunk out of demon school. You've brought weakness upon the legend of Trigon. After I revoke your dark powers, then I will destroy your friends. What do you know, Raven was right all along. You are a major wiener. And how are you going to defeat the most powerful being in the universe? By using the powers you gave us. Titans, go! Whatever. He's gone for now. But he'll be back, probably for Thanksgiving.
