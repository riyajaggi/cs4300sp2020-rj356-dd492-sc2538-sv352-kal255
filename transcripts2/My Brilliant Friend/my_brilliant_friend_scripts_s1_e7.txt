 Lenù, you're back. - Did you walk all the way here? - I took the train. - Look how pretty you are. - Thank you. - I'll carry your case. - No, I can manage. Antonio, bring me the spark-plug wrench. Bye. Bye. - Who is it? - I'll go. Hi, Mamma. What did you do? Did you misbehave? Did the teacher's friend kick you out?

 What are you talking about! Lenù! Why didn't you let me know? I'd have come to the port to get you. What are we doing here? Come. Come inside. How pretty you are. Lenù! - Hi, Lila! - Are you coming down? Be right there. Lenuccia's here. Hi, Lila. You don't know how much I missed you. Me too. I'm so happy to see you.

 Look at you, look how pretty you are. Come with me. Lenù! You're so tan, you look like an actress. Thank you. You're tan, too. - I took a week's vacation in Ischia. - I was in Ischia, too. I know, Lila told me. I looked for you but I couldn't find you anywhere. Well? Elena's back, what do you want to do? Let's go. But remember that you invited her, not me. I only accompanied you. All right, get in. I'll go. I don't care if Marcello Solara sees us. But if you care... we won't let it happen. Although he knew about Marcello Solara, Stefano violated the rules of manhood seemingly without a care. How long had they been seeing each other? Something big was happening. Lila could not know that she was setting off an earthquake. But are you really different? From whom? You know. That's the idea. But in the end, who the hell knows? I haven't forgotten that you wanted to tear out my tongue. They were different times. Once a coward, always a coward. You were twice my size. Pull over. I said pull over. Let's go back. If Rino doesn't see me, he'll get worried and come looking for me. Your brother's not all there. Did you make those shoes in the window? What would you know? - That's all Rino talks about. - And so? - They're beautiful. - Then buy them. - How much do you sell them for? - You need to talk to my dad. Where are we going now? Lila said, "buy them"? Well, I'm going to buy them. They're light, but they seem resistant. They've got a really good line. - What size are they? - They're 43, but they're a loose fit. They're a bit tight. We can put them in the machine, to stretch them. Lenù, how do they look on me? Good. Then I'll take them. Don Fernando, your son said that all three of you worked on them and that you want to make other models, for ladies, too. Lila, get the drawings. Lenù, would you buy them? Yes. All right. When will they be ready? We keep them in the machine for three days. How much do I owe you? Papa, what do you say? I say... we can do 15,000 lire. They're an exclusive Cerullo model, they're expensive. Here's 15,000 lire. And I'll add.. another fifteen. But I'll take the drawings. Take them, I can do them again whenever I want. Don Fernando, one more thing. I've rented the shop next to yours. For now no one's using it. If you decide to expand... I am at your disposal. Okay? Have a good day. Bye. Rino. Bye, Stefano. Bye, Lila. Lenù, get in, I'll drive you home. No, if Mamma sees me in the car with you she'll smash my face in. You think that my dad and my brother are stupid? What do you mean? If you think you can fool around with my family, you're wrong. You're offending me, I'm not Marcello Solara. And who are you? A businessman. The shoes you designed have never been seen before. All of them, not just the ones I bought. So? Give me some time to think about it, I'll see you soon. Marcello's already tried to buy me every way possible. But nobody can buy me. I don't spend a penny if I don't think that I'll get a hundred back. Lila? Come. See you later. Yeah. I thought I'd cry night and day over what happened to me in Ischia. Instead, my perspective changed within just a few hours. The island faded to make way for what was happening to Lila. I had the feeling something terrible was going to happen. Get up, get up now. Are you happy? Answer me. Are you happy now? Today, a while ago, you were with her, weren't you? He's watching television, let's keep our voices down. You think he wants to swindle us? And how? Let's hear it. Keep your voice down! You don't understand. Stefano's offering to expand your shoe store into a workshop, producing Cerullo shoes. - And who'll put the money in? - He'll put it in. - Did he say so? - No. He implied it. But does he realize that handmade shoes cost? If he doesn't realize now, with what you made him pay... You're a woman and you're still learning the trade. - He says you'll get some workers. - And who'll pay them? He will, but you pick them, use your own judgment. - And if they don't sell? - You've lost time, he's lost money. And that's all? And that's all. We have to accept. It's our big chance, we gotta go for it. I'm going out. Where are you going, Rino? I'm going out. - You like television a lot, eh? - I'm waiting for Lila. By the way, have you seen Stefano Carracci's new wheels? Have a good evening. Don't be like that. Come on, what will it cost you? Come for ten minutes, you can say hi. Lila, cut it out and come! What are you shouting for? If he hears you... Of course I gotta shout, she always makes trouble! - What do you get out of doing this? - Nothing. I don't want to see him not even for ten minutes. Poor thing, she said to apologize. She doesn't feel well, she's in bed. Marcello, stay, have a drop of rose liqueur. I'll have a little rose liqueur. Don Fernando, you understand me. If your daughter's going to bed, what am I doing here? She had a slight headache. I know Lila does the shopping at Stefano Carracci's. And where else should she do it? No, Carracci made Rino a work offer. But Lila doesn't come into it. - They saw her in the car with him. - Elena was there, too. Stefano's after Greco's daughter. Then Elena's not suitable company for your daughter. Tell her she can't see her anymore. Is that clear? Of course. Of course. She mustn't see her anymore. I don't know to what extent Lila had planned every move. For sure she chose Stefano to get rid of Marcello and I definitely backed her up in that undertaking. And now we knew that something was going to happen that day. Stefano himself told us to wait outside the store. Rino. I want to hang it here, what do you say? Does my sister agree? Who'd dare do anything if your sister doesn't agree? Hold it up, I want to see. Don Fernando, come take a look. Do you like it? What's it for? They're Lila's drawings. It's the first thing customers see when they walk in. Guys, go get a coffee, today it's on me. Don Fernando... I want to marry Lila. But Lila is engaged to Marcello Solara. Don Fernando, your daughter isn't aware of that. - What do you mean? - It's true. You and Mamma let that pissant come visit, but Lila doesn't want him. You've never understood anything, ever! But why do you want to get married now? When I married Nunzia I had to give up all my plans. What do you think? I tried to go out on my own, too. When I left the factory I had amazing shoes in mind. Not like these playthings that Lila makes... They were perfect. But then I married Nunzia, whose hands were too weak and didn't want to work. I should have married Ines... she was a hard worker. Don Fernando, listen. I'll only ask you one thing: let your daughter decide. If Lila wants Marcello Solara, I'll put my mind at rest. I love her so much that if she's happy with someone else, I'll stand aside. And things between you and me will stay the way they are. But if Lila wants me, no discussion. You gotta give her to me. You're threatening me. No, I'm asking you to do what's right for your daughter. I know what's right for my daughter. She knows better than you do. Lila! Lila... I'll say it to you in front of your father. I love you more than my own life. Will you marry me? Yes. It's a huge insult. Not just to Marcello, to all the Solaras. And now who's going to tell that poor boy? I'll tell him. Excuse me, I'm running late today. It'll be ready soon. Marcello. It's getting late here, will you take me to get an ice cream? Ice cream? Before dinner? - Just you and me? - Yeah. Can we go? Go. What do you think, Fernando? Yeah, go get an ice cream. Do you want to come with us? No, thank you, Marcello, I'm cooking. Ten minutes and we'll be back. Let's go, Lila. Lila, we're going up to watch television. - Are you leaving? - We're going to get ice cream. Before dinner? Marcello... Have I ever told you that I wanted you? No, I know. But do you want me now? No. I love someone else. - Who is it? - Stefano. I already knew. - But I didn't want to believe it. - Well, you better believe it. Because that's the way it is. - I'll kill him and you! - You can try with me now if you like. What are you waiting for? I love you too much, I can't do it! You get me? Then send your brother, your father... a friend, whoever you want. Maybe they've got the guts to do it. But tell them to kill me first. Because if you touch anyone while I'm still alive, I'll be the one to kill you. And you know I'll do it. And I'll start with you. Send someone to get the television. We don't need it. Lila had been brave, but not prudent. She also knew it couldn't end like that. I was doing very well at school. The teachers were happy with me, I was being noticed more and more. Greco! I avoided Nino, I didn't want to speak to him or even see him. Lenù! The repulsion and anger the memory of his father aroused in me, extended to him. Dabunt Metelli Nevio poetay. "Po-etay"? Is it that difficult, Manzo? With the metric pattern marked on the blackboard? How will you memorize the hexameter, the iambic hexameter, the elegiac couplet of Greek literature? How will you do it? Greco, you read the sentence on the board. Let your classmates hear the rhythm of the verse, the rhythm of Saturnian verse. Malum... dabunt... - Can't you see properly? - I'm sorry, sir. - I see everything foggy. - Foggy? Greco, you must absolutely have someone take you to an optician. Give me your exercise book. I'll write a note to your parents. Bring it back tomorrow signed. All right? Manzo, let us proceed. Malum dabunt Metelli Nevio poete. Please, repeat. Back to your seat, you're destroying Latin metrics! Please, go away. I feel like crying over how much these lenses cost. But can't you see that I'm even uglier like this? You know how you ruined your eyesight? You're always poring over books. You should have thought of that before. He's still in love. Weren't you going for a drive? No, Michele's got stuff to do with Marcello. It's true, she looks like an actress, but since she's been with Stefano she's dressing up too much. She thinks she's Princess Soraya. Why do you think she got engaged to Stefano Carracci? - She set up the whole family. - Lila loves Stefano. Lila knows perfectly well where that money comes from. Again with Don Achille, the black market and all that wartime bullshit? Until recently, your friend agreed with me. Why, where does Stefano's money come from? From the gold of family mothers that Don Achille hid in his mattress. She's playing the lady with the blood of the poor. And she's being kept. Her and her whole family. And she's not even married yet! - Look, the grocery store... - What does "kept" mean? Kept means kept. Who pays when Lila goes to the hairdresser's? Or when she buys clothes? Who put in the money for Rino's shoe store? Are you saying that Lila's not in love but that she's sold herself? No, Enzo, that's not what Pasquale meant. We all love her. - Let Pasquale answer. - Yeah, she sold herself. And she doesn't care how dirty that money is. - No... - Sorry, Lenù. - A girl who sells herself is a...? - Whore! - What? - I call her a whore. Who's a whore? Enzo! Pasquale! Pasquale's right. You would be capable of dying for her. But Lila's only a big whore. Now she wants to play the lady, but when Marcello went to her house, she gave him blowjobs. Did you know? - Who told you? - Michele. Did he tell you Marcello was the only one who thought they were engaged? He had no reason to make it up. Marcello can get all the women he wants. It can't be true. It is, he bought her a ring and she gave him blowjobs. - It's not true. - Elena's right. I don't believe it. It's not true. See you tomorrow? Lila! Wait for me! I'm scared. People are saying some really ugly things. What if Stefano finds out? I thought... Are you talking about what Marcello says about me? About what we did at my place? - You already know? - Stefano told me. They all told him. You gave him blowjobs... what does that mean? What did you do? - Is it dirty? - No, I didn't do any of it. I swear to you, none of it. Lila, is it serious? - What if Stefano gets mad? - He knows it's not true. He asked me if anything happened with Marcello at my place. I said: "Are you crazy? Nothing ever happened." Stefano said he believes me and doesn't want to talk about it. We've decided to rise above the Solaras. Rise above? Pretend they don't exist, the Solaras and the neighborhood. Lenù... I want to tell you something. What? Fire! The store... What the fuck are you looking at? There's nothing to see. Go away. And tell whoever it was that when I catch them I'll kill them. We don't care about the car. I'll kill him! Whoever did this is a scumbag and won't get away with it! We'll find him. No one knows anything. So, what the fuck are you looking at? Go back inside! Did you see anything? You don't even have the guts to face us! It's easy to set fire to a car... Pieces of shit! Cowards! I can buy a new car tomorrow if I want! You're just a bunch of lowlife scroungers! You're trash! You want to scare us? You gotta tell me who it was. I'll come into your house and kill you! What if it was Pasquale and the others? If it was them, they did the right thing. I promise you I'll kill him right in front of you! Right in front of your very eyes! You didn't see anything from the balcony? Lenù... I'm getting married in March. What are you doing now? Are you crying? The reality of that news made real the fork in the road that would separate our lives. And what's worse, I took for granted that hers would be better than mine. How's the kid coming along? Thanking the Holy Virgin, he's growing well. Goodbye. Good morning, Fernando. Mr Solara, to what do I owe the pleasure? Everyone's talking about your new business. I wanted to see for myself. The shoes aren't in production yet. And so you're going to start producing your own shoes? Good for you, Don Fernando, way to go. More than anything else, it's my son's idea and Stefano Carracci's. They've become men, little by little, they're learning a trade. This shop will be very big. The workshop's going here and this is the area for the customers. And these would be the shoes? No, these are a little girl's drawings. You know, there's a certain way to treat people? And the way your daughter treated my son, parading around with the other one, it's unseemly. You can't say that, because... I get the business side, but not the betrayal. I can explain. These shoes are going to come out great. Actually, now that you're making them, make a pair for me, too. They're elegant, they're for gentlemen. If I don't buy them, who will? There are no gentlemen in this neighborhood. Kid, gimme a light. Careful with all these glues and varnishes, they're dangerous. The tiniest spark and it'll all go up. Goodbye. - Like to try the mortadella? - No, it's too fatty. Fatty? What are you talking about! - Hi, Lenù! - Good morning. I'll serve the ladies and I'll be right with you. That's great, Lenù, you got straight A's. - Good morning, Lenù. - Good morning, ma'am. Come. How did you do in school? - She got straight A's. - Well done! He passed with all B's and I'm satisfied with that, just imagine how proud your parents must be! You're a good girl, you apply yourself. Not like your friend, she wants to play the lady without working. This morning Pinuccia asked her to help with some accounts and she said maybe she could tomorrow. She couldn't today because she had to go to the hairdresser. Ma'am, I have to pay. Yes, what did you buy? A little salami and the provolone my husband likes. - How much is it? - It's... Eight, as usual? Whenever Lila's mentioned Mamma gets nervous. - Why? - She's sort of right. - She's always intimidated me. - What do you mean? My brother's very brave to marry her. - What are you saying? - I'm saying you're better. In his place, I would have married you. - Alfonso, stop it... - It's true. You're embarrassing me. Give me your shopping list, I'll take care of it. Apricot jam, is that all right? - Can I have the water my mom gets? - Just one? Greco! How are you? Good morning, miss. Good. Walk home with me. - Let me carry it. - No, you've already got yours. No, let me. How are you? This pain in my mouth is getting worse. What does the doctor say? He says I have to wait, do tests... They don't know what I've got. Let's talk about you. How are things? Did you get your grades? Yes, I passed. Well done, my girl. I knew you would! The other day I saw Cerullo in the street with her fiancé. Did you know they're getting married in spring? In the end, she's marrying Don Achilles' son. Yes. Him. But... All the beauty she had in her head when she was a child... it's gone the wrong way. It's all ended up in her legs, in her bust, in her ass. All places where it soon fades before you realize you even had it. You're pale, you need to get some sun. My mother doesn't want me to go to Ischia this year, she says I have to find a job, I have to help the family. Go see the stationer, she asked if I know a reliable girl to take her children to the beach. - Shall I come with you? - No, I don't want to bother you. - I'll go by later. - Why later? Go now. Don't worry, I'm not in great shape, but I can make it home. Go, my girl. Thank you, miss. - Have you bought a new car? - Sharp, huh? Sure is! - It's better than the other one. - Is it a Giulietta? What are you doing here? I felt like a swim so I came. - And the shop? - For today it's closed. Give me your things. Okay. I'll put them next to mine. - Who are you? - A friend of Elena's. - Are you coming in? - Yeah, later. I only ate a little while ago. - Do you know how to swim? - Sure, but I still have to digest. You can't swim. Antonio, dive in. He can't swim! He can't swim! He can't swim! Antonio! Are you all right? Yes. Now I'll show you. - Me, too. - You, too? Come here. Come here. Sit down, girls. Antonio... I want to get changed, will you come with me? Where? There's a changing hut with a broken lock. - You can hold the door closed for me. - Okay. Grazia, I'll be right back, be careful. Lenù... What is it? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? It doesn't matter, nothing. Do you want to ask me to go steady? What are you doing? Come on, Lenù, relax. These girls are so slow. They're so slow! You need to take a bath at home. They're so pretty! Here, hold this. - He's come to get me... - Mamma. Calm down, everything's all right. I'll take you home. Yes, let's go home, we've got to get everything ready. Donato is back, he's come to get me. Yes, yes... - He's come back for me. - Let's go. He's come back for me. Let's go, you didn't even put your shoes on. He's come back for me. He's come back for me. He's come to get me... Elena. Hello. How are you? I was hoping to see you in Ischia. Hello. Listen, I gotta talk to you. For a year all I've thought about is you. I can't live without you. I've written some poems, I want to read them to you. Can we meet somewhere, just the two of us? Please. Leave me alone. - I never want to see you again. - I can't. I'll wait for you forever, Lenù. Wait for me in the tunnel. I'll take the girls back to Iolanda and then I'll come. Elena, I'll be waiting for you. I'll be waiting. Let's go. Mr Sarratore? I don't know if you remember Antonio, he's Melina's eldest son. Of course, I do. I remember him. Hi, Antonio. He's my boyfriend. We've spoken, now he'll explain. I'm happy to see you again, Mr Sarratore. I haven't forgotten. I'll always be grateful for what you did for us after my father died. I want to thank you for getting me a job with Mr Gorresio. It's thanks to you that I learned a trade. Tell him about your mother. But you don't live in the neighborhood anymore, you don't know how things are now. My mother... she loses her mind at the mere mention of your name and if she sees you, even once, she'll end up in the asylum. Antonio... I never wanted to hurt your mother. You rightly remember everything I did for you, I only ever wanted to help you. Well, if you want to keep helping us, stay away from her. Don't send her books, don't come to the neighborhood. You can't ask me that. You can't ask me not to come back, you can't stop me from coming back to places I'm fond of. I can't stop you. But if you make my mother lose what little is left of her mind, I promise you'll lose all desire to come back to this shit neighborhood. All right, I get it.
