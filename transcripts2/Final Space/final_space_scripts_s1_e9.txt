 Gary: Previously on "Final Space," Gary journeys to Inner Space to see the titan, Bolo, who's been asleep for 10,000 years. While there, Gary's father tells him to go to Earth to find the last anti-matter bomb. With it, they can close Final Space. Let's hope there's still time. Hey! Is that mustache Gary? It sure is. H.U.E.: Gary. The cookies will be done in one minute. Gary: Oh, good. I'm extremely excited...

 for these cookies. I'm scared, H.U.E. I know, Gary. You'll stay with me till the end? Till the very end. Thank you, H.U.E. It's been an honor to be your friend. [Title music] 1x09 - Chapter Nine sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  Little Cato: Gary, what were your father's exact instructions? He said, "Get the Anti-Matter bomb and close the breach."

 That's a really big place. Gary, I might be able to help. I have found this in your father's files. Log 2845B ... Captain John Goodspeed. Big day. Took forever, but we finally got there. The Anti-Matter bomb. What we do here could be the difference between Earth's survival and its being swallowed up into Final Space. Hey, John, if we survive this, what do you say we kick it up with some taquitos, bro? I'm going to kill him. I know where that is. It's the Infinity Guard Spire. Then next stop ... that place! [Music] [Beeping] Oh, my gosh! H.U.E., wh... what is going on? - Where are we?! - Earth, Gary. It has shifted from its coordinates and is being sucked into the breach. The oceans are the first to go. Oh, my God. It's happening. I blame KVN. Way to go, KVN. Way to go! I'm getting better! You're getting worse. So much worse! It hurts! It hurts me physically! ♪ Things are getting better ♪ ♪ The sun is shining, the clouds are parting ♪ ♪ And this guy is making great striiides ♪ Sing with me! You're doing great, KVN. Thanks! I am doing great! - Oh, my God! - That's different. - Turtles?! - That's a little one! Dear Heavenly Lightning Lord! We're being attacked by Ninja Sea Turtles! No, Gary. But we have flown into a school of them. [Laughs] Good! They're still in school. [Bang] Chookity. This is so wrong. This is very wrong. New York. The planet has been mostly abandoned, Gary. Look at this place. I've been to New York before. And this... This looks better. Not by much. Gary, uh-oh. You'll have six hours to locate the Anti-Matter bomb. After that, all of what you see now will be gone. [Whirring, pulsating] The Infinity Guard betrayed the human race. They chose their side, and we're on the other. They will show us no mercy, so I suggest we show them none. Now let's find that bomb. I have no idea what you're talking about, but... Count. Me. Out! Later! [Laughs] Gary, the S.A.M.E.S. have retrofitted the plasma torches, rail guns, and other sundry maintenance equipment into heinous super weapons. Yes, H.U.E.! Good lord, yes! Do you know what that makes you? That makes you Employee of the freaking Month. [Buzzer] Quinn, can I ask you something? - Soldier: Fire! - Oh, my ... That came kinda fast! Take 'em out, boys! Mooncake: Cookity pok! [Guns blasting] Go, go, go, go! [Laughs] Oh! [Guns blasting] Quinn, I still have that question. - Yeah! - Boku! - Mooncake: Woop! Pah! - Gary: Go, Mooncake! Oh, oh, yes! Yes! Oh, my ... oh, no. Quinn! About that question. What I wanted to ask is would you like to drink alcoholic liquids out of a cup with me? Now? You're asking me this now? Oh, okay, just gonna cartwheel away from me. Okay, that was close! Oh, my God. Ow, ohh! Oh! But just, you know, I mean... come on, Quinn! It jus... it's just a drink. Shouldn't we be concentrating on this? I can't concentrate on this because all I am thinking about - is if you wanna go out with me! - Then no. [Alarm blaring] Die! Die! Die! Why? Because I can't concentrate on killing these guys if I'm concentrating on that! Did anyone ever tell you emergency lighting - brings out your hotness? - Shut up. [Guns blasting] [Music] [Whirring up] [Music] [Guns blasting] Aah! Ohhh, don't worry, Gary. KVN can handle this. KVN, don't handle this. Handle this? You got it! [Crash] [Rockets soaring] [Explosion] [Whirring, beeping] KVN, what the freak is that? You just had a mech suit lying around this whole time?! Yeah, so? [Grunting] Good lord, I hate you so feverishly. It hurts. It physically hurts me, KVN. - Exo suit KVN: Hey, look, KVN! - Hey, guys!  - Hey, KVN. - You look great. - Hey, KVN. - ...What? KVN, it's me ... KVN. - Me? - You! - Hey, KVN. - Hey, look, it's KVN. - Hey, KVN, you look great! - Hi, KVN! You look great! - Hey, KVN, over here! - Where? - Here! - Haha! Don't shoot us ... shoot them. - Anything for a KVN! - Anything for a KVN! - Anything for a KVN! - Anything for a KVN! - Handled! - Gary, give him a little something. - How little? - A thumbs up? Ugh. So much hurt. My thumb ... It's burning. [Cracks] Oh! [Screams] We're best friends now. Guys, do you hear this? - We're best friends now. - We're not even friends. Right. We're best friends. Gary, there isn't much time.  Only four more hours to locate the bomb before the Earth is sucked into the breach. Bomb vault, yo! We found it, guys. [Zaps] [Beeping, hissing] It's gone. Where is it, H.U.E.? We're running out of time. Odds are that space douche has instructed his dickheads to hide it. H.U.E., can you find it? Mm-hmm. Hmmm. Ah. All files have been deleted. - Location unknown. - Unknown?! Then it's over. Drop your weapons! Drop them now! Chookity! I mean... now it's over. I thought that ... I thought before we were over, - but now we are all going to die. - Get down on the floor! Not that you asked, but this is why you're single. I didn't ask. But since you brought it up, enlighten me. Okay, well, I actually didn't think that far ahead, but... Look, Gary, why do you even like me? Because you're everything I'm not. - And that's a good thing, right? - Hell, yeah, it is. Guard: Commencing executions. Guard 2: Take the life form to the Lord Commander. Just a second, guys. Uh, look, love isn't a formula. It's messy. It's real. It's raw. - Prepare to die, traitor. - Then, yes. I'll drink liquids with you out of a cup. [Laughs] I guess one drink can't hurt. Say goodbye. [Zap, zap] - Sorry I'm late. - Tribore! Is it Tribore? It is! Pachu. Pachu. Pachu. Pachu. Pachu. Take five and call me in the morning. Hey, guy! I don't know who you are, but I like how you keep shooting people even after they're dead. Isn't he great? He's so handsome. Then welcome to the Resistance. Pay attention. He's talking. Quick, follow me. Will it be dangerous? You bet'cha! - Chookity! - What are you doing here?! When the Lord Commander infiltrated the Infinity Guard, a Resistance rose up and they needed a leader. Someone pure of spirit and incorruptible. Only one person met those criteria. - Tribore. - I thought you've just been skulking around my apartment wearing my dresses. I was in deep cover. Do I have to explain myself to you? I don't. - Is that my scarf? - It was. Does this Resistance of yours happen to know - where an Anti-Matter bomb is? - Not yet. Richard? Hack into the mainframe. We need to find an Anti-Matter bomb. - This way! - Shannon: This is amazing. [Laughs] So this is the end of the world. I was hoping for more. Richard said there was a secret base where the bomb is being kept. That's so Richard. Do you want to get a drink? Oh, wait. You're busy. Why would you want to get a drink with me? Just looking at you is enough... - ...for a lifetime. - This is the bar where we first met! The entrance is hidden. How do I know? I actually don't know. Come on, KVN. I need your sensors. I have sensors?! Hooray for KVN! Gary, I have sensors! Yay! Oh, I can't believe it. Look ... I can't believe it... So, are you going to buy me that drink or what? Hell, yeah, I am. Pick your poison. [Glasses clink] [Seat squeaks] So, I guess, I'm just saying, this is our first date. I'm gonna die! We're entering the meaningless void! - Cheers. - Civilization ends now! Glass clink. Did Tribore find it? He did! No thanks to Richard, which, again, is so Richard. [Buzzing] [Door creaks] Aah! No freaking way. Five years ago I karate chopped this man to steal his clothes. Schwa! Swallow! You're a good guy, Gary! Did not anyone help him?! - Oh, you jerk face. - He's still alive. I gave him aspirin ... No, I gave him Crylenol. Oh, and I overdosed him. You're not a good guy, Gary. Oh, you're such a terrible human being! KVN, are you detecting anything worth chatting about? Nope. Nope. Ooh, I mean yes! Announcer: Secret underground bathroom base now accessible. Tight! Gary, there is a reinforced concrete structure 17 meters below the surface.  Not to be a buzzkill, but the breach's effect on the Earth is reaching critical mass. Gary, would you stop making the face and hurry up? [Music] [Music continues] Gary, I am detecting very high levels of Anti-Matter. Tribore. You did an okay job. It was nice work. It was! Gary: The bomb's in there. You guys, stay back. I'm goin' in to get it. Ah, uh, aah! [Gasping] - Run! - Careful, Gary! [Click, hiss] Structural collapse imminent. Get out! If I get you home by nine, what are my chances of getting some lip-to-lip action? - I'm gonna go with moderate. - Moderate? Oh good lord, my slacks are tightening. Settle down, Cowboy. - Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah. - Aah. [Music] - Gary ... - What's up? This is actually a pretty good first date. [Rumbling] - Ugh! - Quinn! Quinn!! Little Cato! Get this back to the ship, Spider Cat. You got it, Thunder Bandit. Gary, you do not have the required speed to reach Quinn before the pressure kills her. Who said it was just going to be me? - Mooncake, double time it! - Chokity! Chok chok chok chok chok chok chok chok! H.U.E.! Distance. 130 feet. Approaching crush depth. I can see her light. I would advise you to go no further. Seeing as I know you won't listen to me... hurry. H.U.E., what is this? I am detecting high levels of magma about to break through the Earth's crust. Oh, no... Mooncake! Triple time! Oh, no! Aah! Aah! Activate gravity boots! [Music] [Music continues] H.U.E.! Where are you going? Don't worry, we will not leave Gary. [Rumbling] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, Mooncake! Go!! - Ohhh, go, go, go, go, go! - Wa-ehhhhh ... Chokity!! [Chuckles] It's not that impressive. [Music] Mooncake, there you are. _ [Music] ♪ If only I could fix the sky... ♪ No, no, no, no, no. No... H.U.E.! [Music] ♪ It's got a way of knowing when to hurt me ♪ ♪ Oh, it's when the night is long ♪ Where am I? I remember... I was in the bathroom. I had zippered my pants, and then... Oh, my God! Aah! Oh God! Okay... You jerk! You jerk face! ♪ Earthquakes break and shatter the perfect design ♪ - Gary? - You're back. Thought I lost you. - Where are we? - Currently... well, uh, [Laughs] we're being yanked into space. ♪ Towers rise to meet and hear its laughter ♪ Maybe it's because my head is in the clouds ... Not gonna laugh at that one, okay. Ha. I was hoping for a laugh there ... Would you perchance want to join forces with me on a daily basis? I'm gonna give that a hard "maybe." I'll take it! Are you hearing this, Earth? We're hard maybes! Yes!! ♪ Ohh, oh, oohhh ♪ ♪ Ohh, oh, oohhh ♪ [Screaming] [Grunting] ♪ Ohh, oh, oohhh ♪ ♪ Ohh, oh, oohhh ♪ ♪ Ohh, oh, oohhh ♪ H.U.E.! Set a course for the breach. ♪ Ohh, oh, oohhh ♪ ♪ Ohh, oh, oohhh ♪ This could have been so easy. But time and time again, you chose the harder path. The darker path. It's time for you to see that your choices have consequences. I will give you one last chance to hand over Mooncake. Chookity. - Hell. No. - He is one of us. I don't really know him. But he seems very popular. - He stays with us. - Never. Then death it is! I'm coming for you. Ah, yes, I've seen that face before. The face of loss. We have the Anti-Matter bomb! We will close the breach ... you will die! [Laughs] I look forward to it. I'm detecting the approach of an armada of heavy incinerators. - Everyone's gonna die. - You aren't wrong. They're all going to die. If he wants a war, he's got one. Let's do this. [Music] sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  INSIDE THE EPISODE
