 Last season on "Final Space," a lot freakin' happened, so let's burn through it. I'm Gary. A lot of people on Reddit think I'm annoying. Well, I guess they have a point. But if you really want to know annoying, just hang out with KVN for five horrendous years. - We got Mooncake... - Chookity. ...who, by the way, is a planet destroying super weapon. My best friend Avocato, a gruff, tough, little bit rough bounty hunter,

 who, sadly, bit it... His son Little Cato, who I swore to look after... H.U.E., the ship's AI, who can't keep me in check... Tribore, the surprisingly capable and fashionable head of the resistance. And Clarence, someone I hope to never meet again. I never thought someone like me would be saving the world. It's tricky because... no one teaches you how. You just meet someone really, really genuine like Quinn... and her equally hot future self, Nightfall. You hear about a breach in space you've got to close or else. You get hunted by a maniacal dick wad like the Lord Commander,

 and then you just kind of hope it works out. That's what happened to me, anyway. Only it didn't... ...work out. - Gary. - No. Don't. Don't say it. I'm not coming back. Where ... Where am I? I'm not coming back. We failed. We failed freakin' hard. H.U.E., where are we? H.U.E.? H.U.E.? - H.U.E.?! - Sorry, Gary. This is my first time inhabiting a shell. - Is that really you? - Get off my cheeks, Gary. Get over here, you waddling rascal. Come on over. Come on. Right here. I'm waiting. While we're young, H.U.E., please. Get over here. Hug me tight, H.U.E. Hugging, hugging, hugging. - Okay. Okay. O... - I missed you so much. - All right. All right. - Whoa. That was the ... that was the worst hug I've ever received. Gary, we're about to... lightfold! 2x01 - The Toro Regatta This kinda sucks a lot! "If you're ready for some sweet deals, you're ready for some sweet... sweet... Clarence." Oh, that is... truly disgusting. - You're disgusting. - Oh. Oh, God, no. - Clarence?! - Surprise. Well, well, well. Sorry, primate, to inform you of the horribly wonderful news that I now own you. You don't own me. No one owns me. All property gathered in the Interstellar Null Zone belongs to he who collects it. And that "he" is me. - And that property is you. - Oh, well, that's great. And quick, H.U.E., run! You're not going anywhere! Whoa! I can't believe that worked. Begone, self-doubting adolescent demon! Quick, H.U.E., run! And a little faster this time. Sprint mode engaged. Come on, H.U.E.! Put the pedal to the metal! Oh. Now, that scares me. Ah, I see you've met Fox and Ash, my darling children. Just to clarify ... did any of you spring - from that hobgoblin's wiener?! - We were adopted! Which means it hurts my feelings when people run away from me without giving me a chance. Mm-hmm. That's great. Okay, Clarence. Now it's time for you and your robot annoyance to remove your filth. Wash boy. - Little Cato? - Gary? Thunder Bandit! My little Spider Cat. Now, this ... this is a hug. My body is a nightmare. Now, how do we get out of here? We gather every boom stick we can find - and start shooting photons at ... - Ah, before you go any further... Matchy, matchy. Cool. - Good night. - Oh! Mooncake, I wish we'd never met. Ooooh, chookity pok. He has nothing left. You've drained him. - Time's up, wang dangler. - No! I've killed you 100 different ways in 100 different times, and every time, Invictus always takes you. And the cycle begins again. But this time feels different. And when it takes you, tell it we're coming to kill it. I... You finished causing trouble? Gary, may I speak in ironics? You're a prisoner once again. Wow. Freaking hilarious insight, H.U.E. Now we gotta get out of here, and I think I have a plan. Oh, boy. Here we go! Home free, boys! Home freeeee... - Okay. - Not that bad. - Ready to go again? - What?! I wouldn't do that, Gary. Ohh! - Okay, here we go. - We got this. Ugh, I can't feel my head. We got close that time. Good news. Something's come up. A little job which, if you help the family with, you won't have to stay imprisoned here for 20 years. I can feel the oil rushing to my head. Okay. I'm listening. We're stealing the Nymerian Cube. Where's this, uh, Hungarian Lube? Where's that? On a ship that's entered in the Toro Regatta the most spectacular space race in all the galaxy. Gimme this race right now! Ordinarily, it's too well-guarded to steal, which is why we're going to pull this heist in the middle of the race. You've done time, so this should be second nature. I'll even sweeten the deal and throw in... The Crimson Light. A dietetic but delicious-sounding soft drink? - A VX-9 light runner. - Ooh! Envied by all. We get to go free? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. And we get a spaceship? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. All right. You got yourself a dealio, yo. Put. Them. Down. Wha... Oh. No. Oh, no. For a second there, I-I thought it was ... - I'm baaaaaack. - No! I saw you die! It was so beautiful. Go back! I can't go back. I sensed that you're in danger. Do you ever sense that I'min danger? - I don't really think about you. - Mnh-mnh-mnh. - Mnh. Mnh-mnh-mnh. - That's why I put myself back together. - No. - I couldn't leave this world knowing my - best friend was out there, somewhere... - No. No. ...forever searching for me. - There was no searching. - Right. - Because I was always in your heart. - Mnh-mnh. - Equidistant from both nips, right here. - Oh! Now let's play who missed who the most. Sounds manageable. We fly the ship. We get our freedom. We get the hell out of here. Then we find Mooncake. It doesn't, like, sound too good to be true or anything, right? Little Cato, sometimes, if you're lucky, life takes the crap in your hand and hands you two slices of bread, and turns that crap into a crap luck sandwich. You know, but the crap sandwich is, - you know, still made out of crap. - Yeah. But there's a little bit of luck in there, too. And we're going to need it. Why is Clarence so obsessed with this cube, anyway? The Nymerian Cube is a collapsed star small enough to hold in your hand and extremely powerful. What? Who is this? I'm AVA, the ship's AI. AVA. I like that name. I'm H.U.E. I am also an AI. Aww. Sure you are. Any more questions? I didn't even have that question. - Right. - I like her. Get ready for race day at the Toro Regatta! The speed of our competitors is only outstripped by their mad lust for victory. The Nymerian Cube is on the Starchaser piloted by Rug Yorkvain, formerly Chag Murfblick, formerly Crix Blangdag, formerly Hux Ringscreckai, a.k.a. Tim White. Everyone's been training year round for this race except for the crew of the Crimson Light, who just kinda showed up. The ragtag crew of the Crimson Light does not look impressive! Krakorian oddsmakers have them all dead by the end of the first heat! Welcome to the Toro Regatta! Racers, spool your engines. And here we go. Five, four, three, two... one... The Toro Regatta! Sponsored by Dart Juice! Before you disintegrate in a vain attempt at glory, taste the freshness of Dart Juice! I'm chuggin' one right now! The Crimson Light bringing up the rear. Wait a second. It looks ... yes! It looks like the Crimson Light is gaining ground. Pilot Gary Goodspeed has burned past Dread Renegade, but something tells me this won't last long. Warning ... weapons are locked to our ship. - What kind of race is this, Clarence? - A race to the death. - Didn't I mention that? - No, you didn't! They got us! They're trying to rip out our lightfold engine! We're gonna get 'em. We're gonna get 'em! Does this help, Gary? - No! - Tropical Muzak engaged. All right, well, a little. Actually, it's kinda catchy. - Dit dit dit dit... - Gary! - Oh, oh. - Gary. - I see it. - Gary! I see it! Whoa! It's the ol' twist and burn as they release a baker's dozen photon missiles ready to cook the Crimson Light! Ooh! And the Dread Renegade goes down! Catch the Starchaser. It's time we make our move. With just three ships left, it's anyone's race. The Starchaser regains the lead! There they go, past Bee-tor, the sacred beetle king! Oh, no! All right. Go, go, go, go. Get the cube. Get the ... Who's ... Who's getting the cube from the Starchaser? You are. You don't think I'm going to risk my life and my children's when I have disposable you here, do you? - What? - Back off, Ventrexian! Unless you want another thousand-year war! You back off, Tryvuulian. No, youback off, Ventrexian! Don't hurt him! I kind of like him! I mean, what? Incoming. Dirty play! But we like that! We're going to need cover from those nasty lasers. - Get out there and destroy things. - Before I take a life... I make a life. Whoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo! Why do this? Ohh! Oh, I can see body parts and everything. Oh, no! I can't do this anymore! The hell you can't! This is how we wreck it, Tryvuulian! Oh, that's "regatta" hurt! Aaah! Keep moving, primate. Starchaser's drop driving! What the hell was that? - AVA? - Yes, gorgeous? Engage the drop drive, Lambchop. - Wait. What is a drop drive? - Engaging drop. Was it that thing? Because I don't want to do it if it's that. - No, no, no, no! I don't want to do it! - 3, 2, 1. Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh! Oh, no! Drop drive initiated. Now traveling through dimensional space. Gary, can you feel it? The Nymerian Cube's right there. Oh, my God. There is a little tadpole digglin' out of your pants. - What is that?! - My Money Compass. It points me in the direction of money. Eh. Kiss. Hmm? Ash, attach a jump cable to the primate. Oh, man. What am I doing here? I ... I lost a frigging planet. I am not the guy for this. Let's go already! Oh, you kicked me! Oh, this is not good! Oh! The cable! No! I'm falling! - Gary? - Someone save me! Hold on! Oh. Ash, how are you doing that thingy thing? Awh! What?! Oh, no! Oh! Ohh. Oh. Finger painting. Who's got goggles with a little moustache? - You do. - Ha ha. Looking for this? The Librarian Cube. Ta-ta. - What is he doing? - Aw, crap. They're destroying their own ship! Oh, no. That means they're gonna hijack ours. We got to get back! Do ... Do your thingy! - Do the thingy! - What thingy? The thingy thing! The ... The ... Activate the thingy! What? Well, I can't just ... I can't just pop it on, man! Okay, last chance to activate the thingy thing! No?! Then ... Then j-jump! You liar! We could have gently levitated! Oh, my. Oh, hello, top of the ship again. Where's generic blond guy? You're a liar! - A stinking liar! - He sounds mad. Whoah! Give me the cube, you handsome, handsome man! All right. I... can... head... butt... you... all... day. Ohh! Uh-oh! Oh. No, I can't. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no! How ... oh, my. Ho! Oh! How are you still so handsome?! - Look who's still got it. - No, actually, I do. AVA, disengage drop drive, my little gumdrop. You got it, big boy. I can't believe it! The Crimson Light's back in the race! But they're not alone. The Invader Red is closing in on us. Oh, and we're about to be disintegrated. She's right, Gary. We got trouble. Shield! Uh, uh! Fire something! Press buttons! Red has been neutralized - by an unidentified ship, Gary. - Yes! Chookity! Regatta, baby! Ya gotta, Regatta! And the Crimson Light wins the Toro Regatta! - Mooncake? - Gar? - Mooncake! - Gar, Gar, Gar, Gar, Gar! Gar. - Oh. - Chookity... - What? - ...pok pok pok pok pok. - Oh. - Chookity! Chookity pok! Pok pok! Chooka pooka! - No. - Anda Chookity - pok pok pokity! - Oh, geez. Oh, God. Okay. - Yeah? - Chookity pok pok pok. - Chooka pok. - You lost your powers? And then, the ... then ... And then, what happened? - Pok. - Oh, oh. You were done. Okay, well. - Nightfall. You're alive? - And you're alive. Let's assume everyone who is here is ... is alive. I have a body now, everybody. What I mean to say is, if you're alive, Quinn is alive, too, right? Gary, no one has ever returned from Final Space. That just means there's got to be a first time. Our work isn't done, child. It's only just... begun. Gary, the Crimson Light is going to need - extensive repairs to ... - The airlocks, lightfold engines, and captain's bath house. I was going to say that, AVA. Yeah, but cha didn't. Isn't AVA the best? Right, H.U.E.? Did you hear me? H.U.E.? H.U.E.? - Have I really sunk this low? - H.U.E.? H.U.E.? You sure have. Ooh. Smell it up, Clarence. It's the glorious scent called Freedom. Ahh. What you're smelling is that you're still my property, - and I'm keeping the ship. - Say what? What? My guess is that you didn't read the fine print. What fine print? There was no fine print. You gave me your word! My word isthe fine print, Dingus, and I just changed it. If you need me... Bolo? Gary. Days are coming. The war for your universe has begun. The time has come for you to free me. Otherwise, no one ... past, present, or future ... will survive. Yeah... Yeah, no, I'm good. Everything depends on all of you. - Our journey leads to Final Space. - Wait, to Quinn? - Together, we can save her. - How? Gather the five Dimensional Keys. With them, you'll have the power to break through my prison. Okay, that's great and all, but where do I ... where do I get 'em? They are hidden across your universe, but you are already in possession of the first one. Peace out, Gary. Yo! Yo, B-Bolo, dude! The universe is a really big place. Engines spooled. I'm going to break a Titan out of inter-dimensional prison. - Sticking around? - Wouldn't miss it. - Out of my seat, primate. - Yo. My ship, my seat. Then you leave me no choice. - Ow. - Clarence, why is there a pack of Smartees ... - Oh! Oh, Clarence! - It's still my Money Compass. I'm just excited to be at the controls. - Grabbing life by its succulent ... - Oh, Clarence! Will you get the hell off me?!
