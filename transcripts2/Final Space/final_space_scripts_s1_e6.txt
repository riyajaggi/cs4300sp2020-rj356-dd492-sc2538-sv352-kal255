 - Chookity? Chookity! - Shoot the laser. Shoot the laser! What Mooncake is trying to say here is... Previously on "Final Space"...  Avocato's been trying to save his son, Little Cato, for a long freakin' time, who the Lord Commander has locked away. Oh, crap! Gary swore that he wouldn't rest until Little Cato was back home safe, and Gary always keeps his word. Four minutes of oxygen left, Gary. Avocato, now would be the time to appear and scoop me up.

 He's not coming, Gary. I'm afraid no one is. H.U.E., what are my chances that I'm secretly an immortal? Like Zeus, Hercules, or Octoprime Rex? There is no chance. I think there's a chance I got an Octoprime Rex thing going on. Big time. You have absolutely no chance because Octoprime Rex is completely fabricated by you. If we're talking percentages of me becoming an eight-sided enhanced T-Rex, what are the odds? Zero percent. So death it is.

 1x06 - Chapter Six sync & correction by f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~  H.U.E., can you patch this in? Transferring. Dad, these are my coordinates. Come find me. I mean, at your leisure, but like, for me preferably fast. That'd be great. Is that your son? - Yes. - He looks healthy. I mean, look, yeah, it looks like ... it looks like you did a pretty good job raising the boy. I mean, it's obvious he's been bathing. I've traced the coordinates to the Udrex System in Sector 11. H.U.E., set a course. Sector 11. Out of the question! We've got a breach to close! - H.U.E., Sector 11. Now! - Stand back. - Ah! - I get it. He's your son. But a world can end if we don't close the breach. You're right. It is my son. - And we're getting him. - Dude! What the freak?! Gary, which is it? Earth, or his son? - You're going to have to choose. - Remember. You promised. It's going down! It... is... going... downtown, y'all! I've thought on it... and I choose both. But first, we need to save Little Cato. In the chair! - You're saying your son is worth the lives of ... - Yes. - Is this totally necessary? - KVN, watch her. I can't believe I trusted you. We're gonna do both jobs. Hang tight. We'll be back. You sure you want to do this? There's a 99% chance that this is a trap. Traps are just open casting calls for heroes. Plus, you already tied up Quinn, so there's no real rebound after that. - You're a good friend. - I would've gone with "great." But whatever. I'll take... good. - What is happening? - I think we're about to hug. Should we? The siren's call is beckoning us to embrace. - We shan't ignore her. - Mmm. Hell, yeah. Thanks, bud. Needed that. - Let's get your boy back. - Chookity! - Mooncake, we're gonna need rich sacks of back up. - Ooh! We're goin' down to the Lord Commander's prison colony. - It's dangerous! - Ooh! It's life-threatening! We're probably gonna die. - I ... You got my back, little buddy? - Chookity! I didn't really sell that very well, did I? Crap! So no back up. - Just two hombres with a dream. - H.U.E., let's do this. We have arrived. Then land this thing. Unfortunately, if we land, we will be detected. You'll have to space vault. Are you sa... are you saying we gotta jump? Jump like freakin' a zillion feet through that purple cloud?! How close can you get us? Hmm. Nowhere near close enough. I can do nowhere near close enough. Punch it, H.U.E.! ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ What is this? Two planets?! There's two! Which one is it? - It's left. - Right? R-Right? I-I can't hear you over the music! - Right it is! - Gary! ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ Something feels wrong. Yeah, because we're on the wrong planet. Agreed. This planet is all wrong. No, literally! We landed on the wrong planet! Gosh dang it. Crap it rough! Of course, it's left. It's always left. Everything in my life has always been left. Left! Left! Yum, yum, yum, yum! Hmm. Wup, wup, wup! Wup, wup, wup! How does it feel, KVN? To be so hot, so good looking, so... so handsome? Hmm. So, uh, am I the best-looking thing - aboard the Galaxy One? - By far. Ohhhhh. Quinn, I can make you very happy here. - Uh, should I kill Gary? - What?! No. But soon. Then it will just be the two of us. And when I say hot, that doesn't even begin to describe - what you've got coming. - Oooooh, I like it hot! Then you... just... untie me, KVN. Maybe I can re-tie you later? With love knots? And then I can kill Gary later, right? Just untie me, you metallic moron! Sorry, just to be clear, did you say - kill Gary, or don't kill Gary? - Shut up. H.U.E., ready a HAWK. I got a breach to close. Quinn, you should reconsider. Too late. Open the hangar. Quinn, I think there is something you should see before you go. Not interested, H.U.E. No one left to trust. You can trust Gary. That's a joke, right? What's this? It's time you get to know the real Gary. There are hundreds. Yes, one for every day of his sentence. Oooh. Hey, Quinn! It's me, Gary. Day one! Uh, I should probably start by apologizing to you and of course the Sanchez family for blowing up their very mediocre restaurant. If we're being honest. Looks like we've come down with a case of wrong-planet-itis. - Luckily, there's a cure. - What? Jump to the next planet! What? No tunes, baby?! Whoo! Yeah! We're planet jumping, man! We are planet jumping! All right! Let's kill them all! They're never gonna see us coming! Oh! Whoa! I say we burst in, guns blazing. - Blind fire from the hip. - For Little Cato. - For Little Cato. - Meow! Oh, come on! - Oh, great. Nobody's around. - This is totally a trap. - Where are you going? - I gotta take care of some biz. - Curious? Thought so. - No. I gotta release a fat pee stream. - I wasn't curious. - You were totally curious. - No, I wasn't! - I ... Whatever! - Papa. - Cato.... Papa. Papa. - Papa. - Little Cato! Ooh. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, not to kill the reunion vibe, but there's something mega not right with your boy. It's my fault. He's angry with me. Well, it's, uh, you know, that's great. It's good, it's good. But, uh, he's got a weird way of showing that, in the fact that he's hovering off the ground! - Yeah, you got a point. - I got a point? I know I do. - Aah! - Aah! Agh! Okay, nice to meet you. And your name is? Death is sweeter than life. I don't know why more kids aren't named "Death is sweeter than life." Fine boy you have here. Things are about to get real. You kept your promise, Gary. Go back. Go back to Quinn. Why would you even say that? Because ... what do you really know about me? I know for a guy who says he's not a cat, you sure do love milk. Other than that, not a lot. Gary, I hate the Lord Commander for a reason. I used to be his Second in Command. I was a master of death. I did anything the Lord Commander asked of me. He above all else demanded loyalty. And one day, he ordered all of his generals to prove their allegiance to him by killing their firstborn. Oh, that's pretty dark. Like midnight dark. Like the darkest of the dark. Like super dark. For eternity! For the Lord Commander! Do it, Avocato, and become my First. Do it! - Why didn't you just kill the Big Cheese? - I tried. - Did you? - Yes. Okay, I like that out of you. Yeah, I believe you. If I sense doubt in you ever again, remember ...  I own your son! And now... I own you! How'd ya end up with a little green tic-tac - cosmic butt head like that in the first place? - By not asking the questions - I didn't want to hear the answers to. - Mm-hmm. - What the hell does that even mean? - I've made a lot of mistakes. You still want anything to do with me? All of us are broken. Just a question of how much and how far we're willing to go to fix it. Seems like you want that pretty bad. - Yeah. - Then as far as I'm concerned, we're back to where we started. I made you a promise to get your son back. And until we get him back, I got your back. It's back to back for life! Heeeeeeey, Quinn! Gary again. I wrote a jingle ...  well, more of a ballad ... which I called "Love Pain." Actually, wait. No. It's called "Pain Love." - It's one of those two. - Ooh. A song? Ooh. H.U.E. won't let me have a guitar. Do you really think I'm going to hang myself by guitar strings?! - Yes, dude. - Yeah, well, you're probably right. So I made one out of a plastic spoon, three pieces of gravity tape, a Cheeto, and my hair. All right, let me just tune it. You know, I haven't practiced this, - so I'm a little bit rusty. - That idiot. ♪ It hurts, it burns ♪ ♪ It pains, it laughs ♪ Ready, Papa? Ready, son. I mean, you know the Lord Commander's - gonna be behind this door, right? - Surprise! - Surprise? You gotta be kidding. - Dude, no one's surprised. I spent many hours of my day planning this! Everyone in the entire prison was murdered for this surprise! Well, I don't know what to tell ya. - I don't think it was worth it. - Silence! O-Okay. Oh. Ohhhh. - I have more surprises for you, the Gary. - Just... Gary. As for your father... kill him. Ahhhhh! Get on with it, you fun-sized devil. We both know you won't tell me where Mooncake is, so I think it's time I find him myself. What are you doin'? Get outta my mind, yo. This consciousness quadrant is members only. So get out of my mind. You can't do that. It's my mind. I didn't invite you into my mind. Get outta my mind! What's this blinking one? That means incoming message. It must have been delayed by the interference. Sure, whatever. Play it. This may be the last time we talk one-on-one. Uh, I told Avocato I was taking a fat pee, but I just wanted to connect with you one last time in case, you know, I don't survive this. Quinn, I know I don't say the right thing half the time or any of the time. You know, in fact, I have Word-arrhea. It's an unpleasant spraying of words that just won't quit. It ... I mean, it's ... it's a thing. Uh, I want you to know that I know that I hurt you back there. - Shut up. Shut up! - Shut up! Could you please shut up?! Shut up! I don't expect that rope to hold you very long. I mean, you're pretty awesome and agile and hot. I guess you probably left the Galaxy One by now. But I want you to know that...  I would have went with you till the very end. I'm sorry, Quinn. I hope one day I can repair the trust I broke. Gary always puts other people's lives before his own. - H.U.E., where's Gary? - Unclear. I have lost communications with him. Then we better get down there and find him. We're coming, Gary. Hell, yeah, dawg. _ Aah! Little Cato?! Little Cato no longer controls this body. I know you're in there, son. - Wrong. - Agh! I've been a terrible father. The Lord Commander ruined me, and I lost you. Please, son. Don't let him ruin you. What if it's too late? It's not. You're still right here. Dad? Ohh! What the heck took you so long?! Now, let's get the hell out of here. - There you are. - Aah! Mooncake is aboard the Galaxy One. No. He's right here. - Now, Mooncake! - Chookity! No! - Time to go, bud! - Name's Gary by the way. Nice to see your paws touching the ground. Little Cato. Likewise. We need to get to the Galaxy One. I got this. - Boom! Done. - You're almost as good as me. Please, I passed you years ago. Huh? Oh, come on! Aah! KVN is here to save the daaaay! - That was tight. - Let's move it. - Gary! - Quinn! Where are you?! Now, H.U.E.! KVN, I'm lowering the tether. - Oh, Quinn, you really do love me. - I don't love you. - I... love you. - Yes! ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ Hoo! Wah-wah-wah wah, wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah. Yay! Gary, Gary, Gary. Hey, hey, hey. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ As excited as I am about today, - I'm even more excited for tomorrow. - Yeah.
