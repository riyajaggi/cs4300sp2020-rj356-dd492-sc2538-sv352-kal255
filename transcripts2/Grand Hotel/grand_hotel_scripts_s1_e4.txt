 Previously on "Grand Hotel"... Your son, he sits by the pool all day picking up girls. If you stop giving him money, it might do him some good. I'm gonna help with the baby, but I can't get the money until I talk to my dad. I'm gonna be a father. I want to step up. I need more money. I tried to handle this on my own, but I couldn't. I found this. "Sky, I can't stop thinking about you." It's a love letter. So your sister was seeing someone.

 He went to a lot of trouble to get this back. Let's see what's going on underneath that shirt! Good night, Carolina. I really wish you would say something. I think I'm in shock. Ingrid, from housekeeping? Mm-hmm. You got her pregnant? And that reaction right there is exactly why I haven't told Dad yet who she is. You know, I really thought that you would be cooler about this. You're gonna be a dad. Aww. No, no, no. Don't "aww."

 This whole situation is pretty much a giant disaster. No, I don't think so. Honestly, you have the biggest heart of anybody I know, and if you're as good at being a dad as you are at being a brother, it's gonna be a really lucky kid. Rachel went on break, so, unfortunately, you're both stuck with me. Alicia? Um, no, thanks. I'm done. Uh, just throw it on my tab. Thank you. Okay. I thought you, uh, liked the guy. I did, until I saw him coming out of Carolina's room the other night. Well, you did tell him that nothing could happen between you two, so it's not really fair to get jealous. I just... I didn't think he'd pick a girl like Carolina. Really? So, you think 'cause you took a dip in the pool with the guy, now you know him? You're right. I don't. I mean, how much could we really have in common, anyway? Uh, Mr. Mendoza? Huh? There seems to be a problem with your bill. Hey. You're cutting me off? That's right. It's time I stopped treating you like a child now that you're having one of your own. So you're punishing me. No. Javi, he's teaching you how to be a responsible adult. Oh. That's funny, because what about your daughters? They're not exactly pulling themselves up by their Jimmy Choos, are they? Oh, basta, Javier. All of these years I've spoiled you because of your... challenges. You never grew up because I never let you. I'm about to have a kid. I mean, w-what the hell am I supposed to do for money? What the rest of the world does... Get a job and earn it. I have some, um, unfortunate news, Helen. I can't afford the annual bonuses for the staff. I don't understand. I thought the hotel was doing better with the EIRey residency up and running. We're at capacity every night. It's more complicated than that. How so? Whatever it is, you can trust me. Please inform the staff. If I may, these people depend on these bonuses. It's gonna be terrible for the morale. The staff will respect Santiago's decision, Helen. And so will you. Helen is right. The staff will hate this. But we need the bonus money to keep things quiet. This will work. Trust me. Trust you? You messed up. Nobody was supposed to know about the girl. And nobody will. We'll pay whoever this is, and it'll be over. Well, it better be, 'cause if the truth comes out, it'll destroy my family, and then... I'll destroy you. Hey. You remember when you told me. Ingrid's birthday was coming up? Yeah. Well, I figure we get the staff to sign a card for her, especially the guys. A bunch of guys being sweet to the girl I'm into. Yeah, sounds great. Dude, handwriting samples. We need to figure out who wrote the love letter to Sky. And, look, I already got a few signatures. Yeah, let's try to find our match. Where's the love letter? It's right here. Okay, people. Listen up. Due to budget constraints, there will be no staff bonuses this year. What? I know this is unwelcome news, but we just have to trust that these decisions are not made lightly. Thank you. I'm sorry. What are we gonna do now? Okay, so, what are we doing about this staff bonus thing? I don't really think there's anything we can do. We can't just take it lying down. Thanks to EIRey, the hotel is busier than ever. But... But do the workers see any of the profits? Nope. But we do get to work longer shifts. Exactly. Santiago Mendoza is raking it in. And you can bet he's not taking a pay cut. That's for sure. It's true. Maybe, but we really can't be rocking the boat right now. If we all band together and show his lordship how well this place runs without us... Come on. Your mom will kill you if you're a part of this. Let's go. Now, who's with me? - Yeah! - Yeah, that's right. Yeah? Let's do it. Ay-yi-yi. Gigi, that dress. You look fantastic. This? It's nothing. We have a VIP checking in today. His name is Victor Calloway. He's the CEO of... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know who he is. He's the, uh, publisher of those luxury travel magazines. Yes. Now, imagine what one cover could do for us. The hotel on every swanky coffee table in the world. Do you think you can get us a cover? Oh, I'll convince him. Victor is an old friend. He called to say he was in town, so I insisted he stay here. Of course. I'm not sure I like that dress anymore. Don't worry. There's nothing between me and Victor. Never was. I just forget you had a life before me. Mm. All your fancy friends. Friends who all vanished when things got hard for me and the girls. Except for you. Ven aquí, chiquita. I love you. Why didn't the maid come to do the dishes? I can't. I'll call downstairs. We've been short-staffed this morning. I'll send housekeeping right up. All right. Hey, Mrs. P. Hey. Are you, uh, busy? Very. But I can always find time for you. What's going on? Uh, so, I need to find a job. My dad kind of cut me off, and I was hoping that you could help me come up with a résumé that, you know, doesn't make me sound like... You've been a professional mooch all your life? Yes. Well, you're in luck. There's some kind of flu going around, and I need temps all over the hotel, so what are you good at? I can make a girl feel like she's the only person in the room. How about Facilities? Hmm. My husband's down a couple of guys, and he's patient enough to put up with you, so... Yeah, great. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh, yes, and, uh, pay... We talking minimum wage? Little bit more than that... Not a negotiation! Go. Got it. Thank you, Mrs. P! Uh-huh. Personnel? Sorry, Mrs. P. It's Nelson. I am really, really sick today. Well, you're not the only one. Any chance you'll be better tomorrow? I guess it depends. Will our bonuses be restored by tomorrow? You little weasel. Don't be nervous, corazón. I just want Victor to be impressed. He will be. The hotel sells itself. Trash needs to go out now. Woman I can't do everything. We have a problem. I can see that. There is no one at reception, and where are all the janitors? This place is a mess. Half the staff called in sick, so whatever they have, it must be contagious. It's not the flu. It's a revolt. A what? They're all faking. It's a sick-out. They're angry about their bonuses being cut. I told you this wouldn't go over well. Now, hold on. If half of the staff is out, who's gonna do all their jobs? We are. We can do this. We just have to put out one fire at a time. Where do we need the most help? Restaurant, spa, laundry... Javi's already working in Facilities, so... Seriously? Mm-hmm. See? He's already more responsible. I'm telling you, he took my bag. I saw it! Okay, double shifts for everyone who's still working, and that includes us, okay? What? These staffers are loyal. You're gonna run them into the ground. What if we could get the rest of the staff back? If you offer them some kind of concession, I'm sure they... I'm not gonna let the staff tell me how to run this hotel. I-I think we can get by. Um, we can spread the staff around to cover, but we do need more bodies. Ah, and here they come. I feel so much better. Mami, we got your texts. What's the big emergency? Santiago needs us today, so you both are gonna be working, and not on your tans. Carolina, you'll take the restaurant. Yoli, the spa. Restaurant? Maybe Danny the waiter works there. How are we twins? Come on, girls. I'll get you uniforms. Really? Uniforms? I know you didn't spend all that time in school so you can fold towels. No, it's fine. It'll be good for the staff to see us working alongside them down in the trenches. Gracias, mija. Mm-hmm. Gracias. Gigi, Victor Calloway is at reception. He's here? Yes. Oh, God. Victor. It's been too long. Ah, Gigi. Still gorgeous. Have you gotten younger? I wish. Welcome to our home, the Riviera Grand. Thank you, yes. It's, uh, pretty hectic. I'm having trouble getting anyone's attention. It's not easy to be the most popular hotel in Miami Beach. Santiago Mendoza... my husband. Lovely hotel and even lovelier wife. And I value them both very, very much. Mateo, his bag. You're the one who said to cut the bonuses, right? So now we're in this together. And, uh, where is the restaurant? I am starving. Well, you're in for a treat, because we have the best chef in Miami. Um he's out today. Well, we do have the best chef, and he will make your mouth water. Right this way, sir. Enjoy your stay. Thank you so much. You told him we have a chef? I got it covered. I promise. Thanks. Hey, did you get more guys to sign Ingrid's card? Yeah. "Happy birthday, Ingrid." Even though we've worked together for a year "and you still don't know my name." Your girl's not making this easy. Hey, what happened to my shirt? I-I left it on the bench right here. Oh, I threw it with the dirty uniforms to get washed. Sky's letter was in the pocket. Pliers. Javi. Hmm? Javi. What? Pliers. Yup. We're here to work, not pick up girls, okay? Hi. Yeah, I just didn't realize how this tool belt would be such catnip for the ladies. Pretty cool perk to being a janitor, huh? I'm not a janitor, Javi. I'm Chief of Facilities. Right. What's up, Pops? Elevator acting up? Yeah, we're on it. Javi. What, you working, too? Yeah. I really wanted to do my part. Daddy cut him off. Wow. Ooh, tough break, buddy. Listen, uh, the pool guy called in sick, too, so Mom wants you to check on the levels. Tell her we'll do it as soon as we're done here. Which at this rate should be sometime next week. I think there's been a mistake. I'm supposed to be working at the spa. I thought I'd be wearing a flowy kimono thing. If you were doing massages, but you're on cleanup duty. I'm not doing that. Listen, your mother assigned you this job. Don't forget. Your sister is in the exact same boat. Look what the hostesses get to wear! Isn't it adorable? You have got to be kidding me. Now, stay close. I don't want our new star employees to get lost. What is this place? You've never been down to the tunnels? This is how the staff gets around without being seen by the guests. Oh, like mole people. What are you doing? Just looking for Danny. I wonder where he is. Okay, you're obsessed. Uh, excuse me? Oh, God. Uh, they assign you to work down here, too? Yeah. Yeah, they, uh... They sent me here to help. Well, this day just keeps getting better. Okay. Well, I'll, uh... I'll just get started on these shirts. Oh, actually, could you go collect the dirty towels from the guest rooms? Yeah, yeah. Right after I do the shirts. Well, we're here to help the guests, and the guests need towels. Nobody cares about the shirts. I care about the shirts. Are you here to help or not? Alicia, did I do something wrong? It's just, you know, we... we had such a good time the other night. Danny, we're coworkers. That's all. So let's just keep things professional from now on. IAtencion, amigos! We have a very special guest dining here today, so everything must be perfect. We don't have a head chef. You do now. I started in kitchens, back when I had nothing. Worked my way up 'til I owned three restaurants. So you know how to cook? Any more questions? Okay, then. Let's go. Move, move! Yes, Chef! You're working today? I figured if anyone called in sick, it'd be you. I wish, but I can't afford it. I already used up all my sick days. Just take it easy, okay? I can't believe the bonuses got cut. Do you know how expensive this... pregnancy crap is? It's so unfair to you. To everybody. And I don't make a lot of money, but if you need anything, I'm here. No, no, I'll be okay. Hey, get this. I heard Alicia Mendoza is in the laundry room. Can you imagine her trying to fold a fitted sheet? Oh, I can top that. Javi is working Facilities. Turns out his dad cut him off. What? I know. Poor little rich boy, no more payouts from the Bank of Santiago. You okay? Danny! I've been looking for you. I'm working in the restaurant today. Why aren't you there? Helping out in laundry. Do you like my hostess outfit? It's nice. I-It's very hostess-y. That's me. Hashtag working girl. Carolina, I'm working. I know, me, too. I just wanted to say I had such fun getting to know you... and your biceps. And it was so sweet of you to carry me to my room. You were pretty drunk. I'm such a lightweight. Hey, why don't you come back to my room after your shift? Um... I thought I was pretty clear the other night. I'm not interested. Okay. That's totally cool. I'm sorry. You're really great. It's just... there's someone else. Something funny? I've just never seen somebody mopping a floor in heels before. Well, they're not heels. They're wedges. And I didn't know I'd be cleaning today. "Cleaning" is generous. You've been spreading dirty water all over for 20 minutes. Hilarious, isn't it? Watching the spoiled princess screw up. I don't think you're a princess. Princesses can clean. Snow White whistled while she worked. And Cinderella? All that bitch did was clean. Give me a break? Okay, between the naked old people, drains clogged with hair, and the smell of this horrible dungeon, yeah, I've had it. Must be really hard on you. Having to live my life for one day. I'm sorry, Marissa. That came out wrong. It's fine. When you're through here, uh, just go wipe down the sauna. And tonight I'll take you to an EIRey concert. His act is gonna blow you away. VIP seats, of course. Fantastic. Ay, Carolina, sweetie, can you help us, please? Table for two? Wait, this is your Carolina? Mm-hmm. The last time I saw you, you were this big. Now she has heels taller than that. And she's a hostess? Here? Yes, yes, and she takes her job very seriously. Where should we sit, Caro? Wherever you want. Okay. Ah, it's fantastic that she works here. Oh, she's a natural. My favorite table is right over here. You know, on second thought, let's sit in the corner. It's nice and cozy over there. Cozier, the better. Good afternoon. Can I get you started with something? Um, you know the menu. Why don't you order us some of your favorites? Of course, um, we'll start with the ahi ceviche... Actually, let's do the conch fritters. The grouper? May I suggest the Chef's Tasting Menu? Excellent. Right away. No, no, no, no, Karl, no. What are you doing? You're ruining the paillard. Like this. Again. Jason. Come on. The food won't walk itself to the table. We're all working doubles here, Mr. Mendoza. I'm doing the best I can. Yeah, and I'm trying to make you better. I don't mean to sound harsh, but your service today is lacking. Just like our bonuses? Jason! It's okay, Helen. He didn't think. Don't you ever speak to Mr. Mendoza like that. What is wrong with you? We were all counting on those bonuses. Okay, look. We may not understand his decisions, but we... Why are you always on his side? Because he has been good to me and our family for years. Yeah, well, he's not being good to you now. Or to any of us. When are you gonna wake up, Mom? You're not one of them. You're one of us. I've been watching you and thought that you could use a break. Oh, thanks. I've survived worse. What happened, if you don't mind me asking... I, uh, I got into it with a great white off the coast of Africa. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, shark won. Hope everything else still works. Oh, yeah. Perfectly. Hey. Hey. So, how's Javi doing? Wish he'd work this pool the way he works those girls. How's your day going? Our son is getting on my last nerve. You should've heard the way he talked to Mr. Mendoza. All right, now, cut Jason some slack. He's just a little overworked. I'm feeling overworked myself. You're not thinking about calling in sick, too, are you? No, I'm just tired. I've been on my feet all day. I know. I'm tired, too. But the hotel needs us. So just hang in there a little while longer. Mmm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. I have here our Paella del Mar. Please enjoy. This is beautiful. Our chef always comes through. Mm. Absolutely perfect. Just like this hotel of yours. Perfect enough for one of your magazine covers? For you, Gigi, anything. A cover story? Really? Of course. But now that we're alone... I have a personal matter to discuss. Personal? I'm not really sure how you feel about your husband. Santiago? Oh, my God, we are very, very much in love. Your first husband, Felix. What? I thought no one has seen Felix in years. Ever since... We've managed to reconnect. I know where he is. Then you shouldn't be talking to me. You should be talking to the authorities. Gigi, he just wants to make things right. But it's been 10 years, Victor. And after everything that happened, I... Felix wants a second chance. Would you ever consider allowing him back into your life? But it turns out Sky was seeing someone. It... No, I found a love letter, and, um, I lost it, so... I'll call you back. I know. Towels before shirts. Oh, um, no. Look, I-I'm sorry. I know I've been a little... all over the map today. The truth is, I was being hard on you because I thought that you and my stepsister were... you know... Me and Carolina? The point is, I was wrong. I kind of overheard you talking upstairs. The laundry chute has bizarrely good acoustics. So you were jealous. I know I have no right to be... but, yes. That's okay. I actually think it's pretty cute. Can we just start this day over? Deal. Oh, thank God. What? Just, you know, thank God we sorted that out. Your ex-husband should be in prison. Innocent people trusted him with their money. I trusted him with my money, and he ran away with it all. Please, Santiago, stop. What did you say? About getting in touch? I... I said I was gonna think about it. I don't like it, either, Santiago, but don't Yoli and Caro have the right to know... He abandoned them just as much as he abandoned you. He's still their father. The man is a criminal. You can't get involved with him again. I won't allow it. You won't allow it? After everything we've been through, is this really a choice? Hmm? Mateo, I think you lost something. What? Your dignity. You think this is funny? I heard about Javi getting cut off. So much for your big plan. That's none of your business. What's the point of keeping this scheme going if he has no money, hmm? Or is this all just to hurt me? Hurt you? You'd have to have feelings for that. You think I don't care about you or the baby? You can't even say it's yours. And you wonder why I turned to Javi. Javi was a bad choice. He'll only disappoint you. Then I guess I have a type. So, I unpacked the seaweed wraps and hosed down the Turkish Bath. Just like you asked. That's your job. Do you want a medal? Look, I'm sorry I complained earlier. I was being a brat. My sister got a cushier job than I did, and it kind of pushed my buttons. I get it. I have a sister, too. Yeah, but mine is my twin. Except she's gorgeous and perfect and gets anything she wants. Wait, are you under the impression that you're not gorgeous? Well, thank you for that, but it's... it's a thing. You know, she's got my mother wrapped around her finger, and guys are always into her, and... What do you care about guys? I mean, you're gay, right? No. Why would you think that? Oh, sorry. I guess it was just wishful thinking. How many more of these do we got to change? Had enough, huh? No, I could do it all night, but we're not, right? Javi, I've known you all your life. You don't have to pretend with me. All right, maybe I'm a tiny bit bored out of my mind. How do you stand this job day after day? I don't just do it for me. The moment we had Jason, I knew. I'd change a million light bulbs to give him a better life. You'll know someday, too. Come on. Yeah. Mm. All right, which one's next? Malcolm? Whoa... Malcolm? Malcolm! Help! I don't need to go to the damn hospital. Dad, you fainted. They said I'm just dehydrated. Then we'll just go to make sure. Hey, uh, don't worry, Malcolm. I'll cover the work. Oh, God. We're taking him to Dixie Memorial. You two can ride along. Come on, Mom. Come on. Helen, I heard what happened to Malcolm. I-Is he all right? I warned you not to cut the bonuses, but you wouldn't listen, would you? Now look what happened! I'm sorry. I didn't have a choice. Why the hell not? Huh? There you go again. Shutting me out. I can't believe I was even defending you. Helen, please. Understand. You are so very important to me. Am I? When Beatriz died and when Javi was in the hospital, I held this hotel together for you, but now who do you listen to? Mateo. I've been at your side for over 20 years. He's been here for two. I don't understand. What happened? Did I do something wrong? No. Y-You just... have to trust me. Mom, come on! You want to save this hotel, you save it your damn self. I'm calling in sick, too. So, have you given it any more thought? I've had 10 years to think. So you tell Felix that we have all moved on, and he should do the same. Don't your daughters have a right to know their father? Felix left us with nothing. And Santiago stepped up to provide a life. Now, that's a real father. I understand your anger, but I think you're making a mistake. It was lovely seeing you, Victor. Have a safe flight home. Hey, we met at the pool, right? Right. Thanks for coming up. I can't figure out what's wrong. Oh, no sweat. If I can fix anything, it's a TV. Oh. Sorry, this place is such a mess. My son just leaves his toys everywhere. You're a mom? Little guy is with his aunt right now, so I have this big fancy room all to myself. Mm-hmm. Just had it on the wrong setting. Whoops! Silly me. Let me get you a drink. Thank you. Oh, I probably shouldn't. So, where's the dad? Not in the picture. Single mom. It's very stressful. I bet. If only I could figure out a way to relax. Yeah. What's it like? What? You know, raising a kid on your own. Oh, for God's sake. You really want to know? I haven't slept in two years. I can't depend on my deadbeat ex for anything, and I barely get a moment to myself, and when I finally do, I can't even get the hot hotel janitor to have sex with me. I'm not a janitor. I'm in Facilities. And I got to get back to work. I'm not coming back tonight, if that's why you're here. It's not. How's he doing? Better. They're gonna hold him overnight to run some routine tests. So, then, why are you here? We've been through a lot together, Helen. And, uh, you're not just an employee. You're... You're also a good friend. I feel the same. And you deserve to know the truth about the hotel's finances. And why I had to hire Mateo. Had to? Yeah. It was part of a deal. Um, no one knows this. Not Gigi, not Alicia. For their own safety. My God, what... what... What have you done? A couple of years ago, the hotel was sinking fast, and I needed a way out. So I borrowed money from some very dangerous people... You're sort of really good at folding for a guy. Is that sexist? Actually, I've... I've had a lot of practice. I had to do my own laundry growing up in foster care. Oh. I didn't realize. I'm sorry. Don't be. I, uh... I don't really remember my parents. I lost them when I was pretty young... Just not young enough for a family to want me. So I got bounced around a lot. That's awful. It was, uh... It was worse for my older sister. You know, she was... She... she was angry. She was a handful. You know, we... We got separated. And I... I tried to stay in touch, but... I guess I've always felt responsible for her. Where is she now? I don't know. My mom died of a heart attack, out of the blue. My brother was like your sister, sort of pissed at the world. You? The more things fell apart, the more I felt like I had to take care of everyone. Sometimes it still feels that way. Like it's all on me to... Make everything right. I guess we've got that in common. We do, don't we? Should we be doing this? I don't know. Should we? I'll see you later? Hola. Hey, uh, nice to see everyone back today. I'm glad you're all feeling so much better. Look, um, I realize that this hotel is only as good as the people who work here. So I've decided to... bring back the bonuses. So please, now, enjoy this party as a gesture of thanks for your hard work. Drinks are on the house. You deserve it. Even you, Nelson. Ah. You little weasel. That's right, baby! 'Bout time! So, hopefully they'll behave now. Yeah. Thank God we still had all this booze left over from Carolina's wedding. This party was a great idea. It was yours. Like I said... a great idea. Thank you for listening to it. Santiago, may I speak with you? I better go get Malcolm from the hospital. Mateo. Helen. I thought you were cutting the staff bonuses. I couldn't do that. These are my people. Sometimes you need to be reminded of who's on your team and who is not. So what are you gonna do about the blackmailer? What I should've done to begin with. Flush him out. Put an end to it, once and for all. Hello. Sorry to bother you. Oh, hey. You're my mom's friend from the restaurant. And I also know your father, Felix. This needs to stay between us, but there's something we need to discuss. May I come in? Over there, sir. Didn't you hear? Everyone's back at work. You're free from the dungeon. I guess I wanted you to see me when I'm not in my hazmat suit. Come on. You rocked that hazmat suit. Um... I know I complained a lot, but, uh... yesterday was kind of fun. And if you ever want to hang out sometime... I'm in. Like a... date? How about Friday? Yes? Mateo. Can I get you to sign something? What is it? It's a birthday card for Ingrid. Yeah, I don't think that's appropriate. Oh, it's just a birthday card. Yeah, I prefer to keep my distance from the staff to avoid any confusion. Excuse me. So, I saw this in the gift shop, thought of you. Oh, you... you... You didn't have to do that. Yeah, but I wanted to. It's not much, but, I don't know, I didn't want you to think of me as a total deadbeat. Then what about the money I need? Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna get that for you, somehow. And, uh, I was thinking... what if I wanted to be more involved? With the baby? Yeah. Yeah, you know, like, be a dad. You shouldn't have to do this alone. Uh, that's room service. I got enough for two. Do you want to stay and eat with me? I-I thought you were cut off. I charged it to Alicia's tab. Don't tell my dad that. Hey, Jason, would you, uh, would you mind setting the table for two? Yeah, right away. Thank you. Hey. I thought you'd be all packed and ready to go by now. What's wrong, baby? They found something. What are you doing? Mateo wouldn't sign the card, so I stole his trash. I figured there's got to be something in here with his handwriting on it. Wow. That's good thinking. Here's something. Get the love letter. See if it's a match. I'll keep looking. Nah. I don't think Mateo's the one Sky was seeing. Wait, what's all this? "$200k." One week. "Or I tell what you did to that girl." Someone's blackmailing Mateo? Over Sky? What the hell did he do to my sister? Hey. Sorry I haven't called you back. It's been kind of crazy here. But I think I'm onto something. So, when do you think you'll come back home? Uh, soon. I'm sorry. Me, too.
