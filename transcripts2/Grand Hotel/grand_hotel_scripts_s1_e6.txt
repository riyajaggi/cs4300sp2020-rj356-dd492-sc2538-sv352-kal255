 Previously on "Grand Hotel"... Ingrid: You want me to take a paternity test? You know what? Keep your money! No one speaks to my dad like that. I think there's something real here. I really like you. My life is complicated right now. I'm sorry. I didn't even know you were gay. Promise me you won't tell my mom. Santiago: Did you find the blackmailer? I'm following them now. You think that you can get away with this?

 Nelson: You wouldn't want me telling everyone what you did. I never touched that girl. I know you didn't. But I also know who did. [ Tires screech ] Santiago: It made the paper. Mateo: On page 12. And it doesn't even mention the hotel. I thought you'd be pleased. No one was supposed to die. An unfortunate accident, Santiago. This was a lucky break. Nelson knew about Sky. He knew we paid off the police. Now no one will ever find out.

 You better hope not. Okay, table six is a problem. Sitting the Wheelers with the Alonsos. Those families love each other. Mr. Wheeler loves Mrs. Alonso a little too much. Okay. Well, we do not need that drama. We are raising money for Mami's foundation. That is right. This is a charity gala. Everyone has to keep it classy. Mm-hmm. Classy? 10 bucks she wears a skin-tight dress with crazy cleavage. [ Laughs ] It's nice to see you laugh. [ Sighs ] How's Malcolm doing with the treatments? Good. Not good enough to come with me to the gala, but that man will say anything not to wear a tux. You bringing anybody? No. No, no, no, no, no. Definitely not. What about Danny? I practically raised you. You think I don't know when you have a crush? Well, whatever that was is over. Danny made that very clear. Where are we at with the tickets? Uh, 90% sold. We've actually already reached our fundraising goal. Santiago: That's great! Beatriz would love this -- seeing you all working together. Yeah, I think she'd be proud. This is gonna be the best gala yet. Well, except for one little thing. [ Jackhammers clanging ] I thought that hotel next door would be done with the renovations by now. But it's all day and all night. I called to complain, but it seems like they have some kind of, uh, special permission from the city. Last night they went until midnight. The guests are not happy, Papi. Well, we can't have that during the gala. I'll talk to the owner. [ Jackhammers clanging ] Finn: I don't want to hear excuses. This should've been done last week. Uh, pardon me, Mr. Finn? The entranceway is the priority now, okay? Yes, sir. You got it. We can't open without it! Andale! Uh, Mr. Finn! Santiago Mendoza. I'm from the Riviera Grand. Oh, Mr. Mendoza. Beautiful property you got over there. Thank you. Uh, I came to ask a favor. We're hosting an event tomorrow night, and, uh, we can't have all this noise. I know, it's terrible. I-I wish I didn't have this grand opening deadline hanging over me, but I do. Um, y-you can't stop the work for a few hours? This event is for charity. And I love charity. Huh? I tell you what, let's set a meeting to discuss. No, no, no, no, w-wait, wait, wait. Uh, we're both here. We can talk now. What are you, Cuban? No, I'm Mexican. Why? Uh, I was just trying to figure out where all this fire was coming from. I love it! My office will call to set the meeting. Adios! No -- E-Excuse me, Mr. Finn! Mr. Finn! Son of a -- [ Jackhammers clang ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Nelson knew something about Sky, you know? I was this close to finding out what, but then he -- He died. I don't like this, Danny. It's getting dangerous. I'll be fine. I want you to come home. You didn't want me to come here in the first place. I'm sorry, Heather. I have to go. Who's Heather? Well, Addie, this is disappointing. I know, but I got an opportunity that's too good to pass up. Let me guess -- The Finn Hotel? Honey, a corporate chain is not gonna take care of you like I do. You think they're gonna schedule around your grad school? They're actually paying for grad school. Oh. Well, that's how they lure you in. I'm grooming you. Stick with us! You'll be manager in a year. They offered me manager now. Damn it! I mean, good for you. Plus, the health plan there is incredible. It covers, like, everything. ♪♪ Yes. I can see how that could be tempting. So, you've had a girlfriend this whole time? You didn't tell me? I know. I should've. What about Alicia? Were you just playing her, or what? Not at all. Honestly, I-I thought everything was fine with me and Heather... until I met Alicia. I-I didn't mean to fall for her. But you did. I know. But Heather and I, we -- we have history. And I-I can't even tell Alicia who I am or why I'm here. And what if someone in her family did something to Sky? Hey, we don't know that. Mateo told Nelson he fixes problems for the Mendozas. So? What if he's covering for them? We've been looking for the guy who wrote the love letter. What if Sky was seeing someone in the family? Well, we know one of them sleeps with the staff. Javi. Mm-hmm. Excuse me, miss? I'm gonna need some fresh sheets in my room because the ones in there got a little messed up last night. Hmm. Mm. I will get right on that, sir, since I am partially responsible. Hey, um, any chance you'd want to come with me to the gala tomorrow night? Really? Like a date? Yeah, I mean, I know we're doing things a little backwards, but what the heck, right? Okay. Sounds fun. So, Gigi is taking me to see some fancy baby doctor today. Gonna get a first look at the little alien growing inside me. Ahh. You don't want to come, do you? Hell, yeah, I want to come. That's my little alien, too. ♪♪ [ Laughter ] This is ridiculous! Yeah, I look ridiculous. I'm taking it off. Baby, you look gorgeous. Keep talking. It's almost too good. Oh. I don't want everyone ogling my girlfriend all night. Your what? Sorry. I'm just old fashioned. And kind of a romantic. I just need to take things slow. I guess I just wish we were going to the gala together. You and me, all dressed up, cutting a rug on the dance floor. [ Laughs ] Yeah, my mom would die of shock. And that's a bad thing? [ Laughs ] [ Knock on door ] Carolina: Yoli, it's me. It's my sister. You have to hide. You're joking. You're in your underwear. Just get down. Were you talking to someone? Were you talking to someone? What? What? I need final approval on your gala look. Is that the dress? I can't. I thought it looked nice. There's gonna be tons of hot, single guys there. They don't want nice. They want sexy. Come on, maybe you can squeeze into something of mine. [ Door closes ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ The arrogance of this man. Wait until you meet him. Papi, I know Mr. Finn rubbed you the wrong way, but his office did reach out for a meeting. [ Scoffs ] Maybe it's an olive branch. Has my guest arrived yet? Yes, sir. The, uh, gentleman from the Finn Hotel is right over there. Who's that? Oliver? Alicia. [ Gasps ] My God. Wow. You look fantastic. Hey! Hi! You know this guy? Yeah, we, uh -- we were both in hotel admin at Cornell. He was a year ahead of me. But always a step behind. Where's Finn? Oh, uh, he got caught up with the renovations. But I can assure you, he's -- he's very sensitive to your concerns. So he sends you. His... Associate Manager. That's what I am! I've been with the Finn London since, well, graduation, and moved to this property last week. A whole week. So, do you have the authority to stop the construction? Not exactly, no. Then this is a waste of my time. Sorry. He, um -- He got a little worked up when he met your boss. Do you think maybe you and I could work something out? Sure. Uh, let's grab dinner tonight. Dinner? Well, I thought it might be nice to catch up over a glass of wine. Unless...? No. Dinner is perfect. All right. Thank you, Gigi, for bringing me here. This is way nicer than the clinic I've been going to. Nothing but the best for my future grandchild. Which pains me to say out loud. God, is it almost over? I hate the sight of blood. Hey. Hey. [ Sighs ] Just look into these baby blues, all right? Relax. You're doing great. Uh, what's going on here? Are you guys... together now? Um... Um... W-We're figuring it out. Okay, Ingrid. Let's see if we can't get a good look at the baby. You're gonna feel a little pressure, okay? It's a...blob. Yeah, but he's a really cute blob. He? [ Laughs ] It's a little early to tell, but let me explain to you what we're looking at. Okay. Right here, this is your uterus. And in the middle is the amniotic fluid. Here's Ingrid's blood. I still need a sample from Javi. So, blood or a cheek swab -- those are the most accurate. No, a swab is too suspicious. He'll know we're doing a paternity test. Wait a second. Javi doesn't know we're doing this? No. And we're not telling Santiago either. Not until we have the results. Gigi -- Listen. I convinced Santiago that we could trust Ingrid. And she may have been sleeping with someone else. [ Sighs ] I-I don't know how comfortable I am with this. Sonja -- [ Laughs ] How long have you been treating our guests? Because you wouldn't have a practice without this hotel. You know that, right? But it's incredibly unethical. Since when has that stopped you? Do the test. ♪♪ [ Door opens, closes ] So, guess who just served a table of 12 and got no tip. Second time this week. Marisa? Uh, sorry. I'm just distracted. I've been seeing this girl. And she says she wants to take things slow, but...I'm starting to worry she's hung up on her ex. That's a red flag. What happened? Don't judge, but I found this keepsake box she had hidden away, and I sort of...went through it. Yeah, that's not great. [ Sighs ] I know. I shouldn't have. But she's been super cagey about her ex. So when I found all these love letters, I couldn't help myself. Love letters? I'll totally return them, but they're so...intense. Can I see them? Sorry. I shouldn't even be looking at them. She'd kill me if she knew. Who is she? Can't tell you that. On top of everything else, she's not even out. Anyway, thanks for listening. [ Indistinct conversations ] Another round? Oh, no, I'm good, man. Thank you. Congrats, by the way -- about the baby. It's, uh -- It's awesome, man. Yeah. I guess the, uh, cat's out of the bag, huh? Basically. But, hey, Ingrid seems like a great girl. Y-- I-It's funny, I, uh -- I actually heard you and her roommate had a thing. Her roommate? Yeah, uh, Sky? The girl that disappeared in the hurricane. Who told you that? 'Cause I didn't even know that girl. I thought you knew all the girls around here. Why don't you mind your own business? Okay? Hey, I need to talk to you. We're just gonna get out of your hair. Why'd you do that? He got all defensive when I brought up Sky. I'm pretty sure that's the guy she was seeing. Definitely not. How do you know? 'Cause Sky was seeing a woman. So, what's it like working for Finn? He's kind of a legend in the business. He's, uh... He's a big personality. Not the most racially sensitive. That's horrible. Yeah, it's not ideal. But a job like this is impossible to get unless your family, like, owns a hotel. Oh, your family totally owns this hotel. [ Both laugh ] You know, working with family actually makes it harder sometimes. Truth is, my dad is kind of also... A "big personality"? [ Laughs ] We should, um, probably talk about the noise problem. Mm. So, all cards on the table, this gala is really important. My mom died when I was in high school. Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you. And my dad set up a foundation in her honor. So it's personal. Right. And our ballroom is right next to your construction site. Well, we better order dessert, then. Why? Because we're not leaving this table until we solve this problem. ♪♪ Just the man I was coming to see. Hey, Doc. On my way to work. Helping in, uh, facilities. I heard. Which is why you need to have your employee physical. I didn't know there was such a thing. Hotel policy -- for insurance purposes. I don't remember Alicia having to take a physical. Hmm. I'll have to check on that. But it's really no big deal. I'll just get some vitals, draw a little blood. Is this a drug test or something? No! Pbht. It's routine. It's a little weird. Did my dad put you up to this? Do I need to call him? No, no, no, no, no. [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Elevator door opens ] You know what? Don't worry about it. I'll just sign off on the paperwork. Okay. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Mija. I've been on the phone all morning with the lawyers. There is nothing we can do to stop the construction. Oh, well, then I guess it's a good thing Oliver and I met up last night and came up with a plan. You and Oliver met up? Yes, Dad. Don't be weird. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are they doing? This is the plan. Yes. We are moving the gala from the ballroom to the lobby. Where there's less construction noise. And to compromise, Finn bought a table and made a generous donation to the foundation. That's not a compromise. That's a surrender. Santiago, the lobby's gorgeous. And it was Beatriz's favorite room. Besides, with music, you won't even hear anything next door. See, and then he'll think he can walk all over us. [ Sighs ] Santiago, where are you going? To handle this myself. There's no stopping him when he gets like this. Now, where's Mrs. P? I want to go over the staff list for tonight. I don't think she's in yet. That's a first. [ Indistinct shouting, jackhammers clanking ] You must be Helen Parker. Yes. That's me. You ready for your interview? As ready as I'll ever be. Right this way. And every Friday, there's a catered lunch on the pool deck. Now, we encourage our employees to try all of the amenities -- there's yoga, spa treatments, there's surfing lessons -- Well, I'm not much of a surfer. Uh, Oliver. What's going on? Excuse me? Well, I've never been on a job interview like this in my life. You haven't asked a single question about me. I already know all about you. I-I practically high-fived myself when you called. I just never thought that you'd leave the Mendozas. Well, it would have to be for a much better offer than what I already have. How does a V.P. title sound to you? Higher salaries, annual bonus, there's a paid leave. Talk to me about the health plan. Well, it's only the best for our executives. It's a Cadillac plan with all the bells and whistles. And my husband would be covered? The first day you start. Wow. You're making it hard for me to say no. Then don't. Javi wouldn't do it? He was gonna call Santiago, and I didn't want to push it. I'm sorry, Gigi, but you can't do a paternity test without the father. [ Sighs ] I have an idea. Yeah? Mateo, is this a bad time? What can I do for you, Doctor? We're doing employee physicals this year. Do you have a minute? I need to talk to you. I am so sorry. I tried to stop him. Oh, that's okay. Just our friendly next-door neighbor. Thank you, Rose. What can I do for you, Mr. Mendoza? [ Door closes ] I expected to meet with you, owner-to-owner. And then you send your errand boy? Oh, I'm sorry about that. I should've been more direct with you from the start. I bought a table at your gala, but I'm not stopping that construction. Is this really the way you want to start our relationship? We're gonna be neighbors for years. [ Laughs ] I highly doubt that. I'm sorry, what? How are you going to survive when the hotel next door is newer, sleeker, and just plain better? I'm gonna put you right out of business. I wouldn't be that confident if I were you. Well, you're not me. You have one hotel. I have 70. Big man, huh? I'm just saying, we're not the same. You need someone to blame for this mess -- blame the workers. I don't know if it's a language barrier or what, but they're the laziest crew I've ever had. [ Laughs ] You know what? You're right. We are not the same. ♪♪ [ Door opens ] ♪♪ I just don't understand why she never told me she dated women. Maybe you and Sky weren't that close. She's the only family I have. But you grew up in different homes, in different states. I know you loved her, but you didn't really know her. Maybe you should just -- Heather. If you think I'm about to give up on Sky, then you don't really know me. I'm sorry, but I'm frustrated. I don't hear from you for days. And then when I do, it's like you don't even want to talk to me. Is there something you're not telling me? ♪♪ I'm just stressed, okay? Fine. You call me back when you actually want to talk. [ Sighs ] ♪♪ Heather? She thinks I'm keeping things from her. Can't imagine why. What time does your friend Marisa go on break? Why? I think it's time we find out who she's seeing. I just need to make an appearance. But I can ditch the gala early. Maybe we can watch a movie. What? Um...I wasn't trying to snoop or anything, but I found these under your bed. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. It seems you had really strong feelings for Sky. And it must have been hard when she disappeared. If you want to talk about it, I -- You went through my stuff. You had no right! You're the one who made me hide under the bed. You can't blame me for being curious. [ Scoffs ] You have a box of her stuff! It's none of your business! It is if you're still in love with her. [ Laughs ] Is that why you want to take things slow with me? This is ridiculous. We're never gonna be in a real relationship when you're always so secretive about everything! I'm a private person. You hide your last relationship. You hide me. You even hide who you are. You're not private, Yoli. You're terrified. [ Door opens ] Marisa! ♪♪ [ Door closes ] ♪♪ Hey. Got your text. What's the emergency? Me. I'm the emergency. I have a million things to do for the gala. You're in facilities... facilitate. Hey, what do you think Mami would say if she was here? She'd say, "Sit up straight, eat dessert first, and help your sister so she has enough time to get ready for her date." Ooh, Danny? Nope, Danny is officially canceled. Good. I ran into him last night. There's just -- There's something off about that guy. If by "off," you mean he's a commitment-phobe, then yes. No, I will be attending the gala with Oliver. The guy from the Finn? Dad's not gonna like that. Give me that. Well, he's just gonna have to deal. Hmm, fine by me. Takes the heat off of me and Ingrid. Are you two -- Four times last night, baby. If she wasn't pregnant before, she is now. Javi, TMI! All I meant was, like, are you guys a real couple? Oh. I don't know, maybe. Things seem to be falling into place. ♪♪ You wanted to see me? Yeah, come in. Perfect timing. I just got this at a thrift shop, and I can't decide which earrings to wear. What do you think? I think we should stop pretending. I'm sorry. I know the baby isn't Javi's. It's Mateo's. How did you -- Was there always a scheme, Ingrid, to get Javi's money? I believed in you. I told Santiago to believe in you. I'm so sorry. I -- I made a terrible mistake. Oh, a mistake? You know, Javi thinks you actually like him. I do. Oh, God, are you gonna tell him? Nope. My relationship with Javi's hard enough. He doesn't need any more reasons to hate me. You're gonna tell him. [ Scoffs ] He's gonna be crushed. I'll give you till the end of the night. What if I can't? Then I'll tell Santiago what you've done. And he won't be half as understanding. ♪♪ Come in. Come in. I'm still getting ready for the gala. I am so sorry about the timing of this, but, um...I got a job offer. At the Finn Hotel. But you turned it down, right? I want to, but...I'm in a tight spot here. Malcolm? I don't know what's gonna happen to him. And we could burn through our savings just trying to keep him alive, and... Finn, they offered me more money, they have a better health plan -- L-Look. Helen, I wish things were different. But I was honest with you about the hotel finances and the trouble I've gotten us into. I need you here more than ever. I know. But if you can't match their offer... I'm gonna have to go. [ Latin music plays ] ♪♪ So, Sky was with...Yoli? Maybe they had a lovers' quarrel and Yoli did something to her. Well, how are you gonna confront Yoli without blowing your cover? You're gonna do it for me. What? Wait, why me? ♪♪ ♪♪ Looks like you got some competition. Mr. Finn. I'm surprised you came. I shelled out 20k for a table, might as well get some dinner out of it. This is my wife, Gigi. I have heard a lot about you. Nothing good, I'm sure. You can't even hear the construction. You made a big stink over nothing, huh? I guess I did. Please enjoy the party. ♪♪ Okay. I thought you hated that guy. I do. Santiago. What are you up to? ♪♪ Congrats on the gala. Looks like a big success. Thank you. So, that guy you're with -- is he, uh, a friend of yours or...? Sorry, Danny, but you don't get to ask me that. ♪♪ You look amazing. [ Laughs ] You should dress like this all the time. Vacuuming in a ball gown? Not sure Mrs. P would go for that. Right. How about I get us some drinks? Bourbon for me and ginger ale for you and the -- the blob? Sure. All right. [ Exhales sharply ] Looks like someone is having fun. I assume that means you haven't told him yet. It's hard. He just seems so happy right now. Well, it's not gonna get any easier. ♪♪ [ Applause ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Oliver? Helen! Uh, I would like to introduce you to the man himself, Michael Finn. It's a pleasure, sir. We've had you on our radar all along. I never dreamed we would actually get you. [ Chuckles ] So are we, you know, getting you? It's a long story. I'll tell you about... As loyal as I've been to this hotel, they just, um, can't seem to return the favor. Aww. So I have to make the best decision for my family, and...I accept. [ Laughs ] Welcome to the Finn Hotel Group, Helen. Cheers! What about Andy Vasquez? Meh. What do you mean, "meh"? His dad owns, like, seven car dealerships and a yacht. Boats are hot. Excuse me. Yoli? A friend of yours is waiting for you downstairs. Said it was urgent. Hello? Marisa? Hi. Sorry, I was just looking for -- Me. I'm the one who asked for you. I don't understand. I know it was you who broke into Ingrid's apartment and attacked me. I don't know what you're talking about. You knocked my friend out. You owe him an explanation. I could have both of you fired. And I could have you arrested for breaking and entering and assault. You left this behind. That's your writing, isn't it? What do you want? Answers. What exactly happened between you and Sky? I didn't mean to hurt you. I swear. But the night of staff drinks... I heard Ingrid talking about getting rid of Sky's things. I should probably move on, anyway -- find a new roommate, get rid of her stuff. And if someone went through her stuff, I knew they would find the love letters. So I had to get them back. But you came home early, and I panicked. Come on, dude. This is not cool. [ Panting ] I'm so sorry. But I couldn't let anyone find those letters. My family doesn't know about me. You gave me a concussion so you wouldn't have to come out? What are you so afraid of? You make it sound like it's easy. But you have a mom that loves you, no matter what. I don't have that. How did it end? With Sky. We got into a fight. Now she's missing. [ Scoffs ] Oh, my God. I didn't have anything to do with that. Sky was my first real love. And when she disappeared, I was devastated. You've done a lot of crazy things to keep your secret, Yoli. Wouldn't it be easier to just be honest? For what it's worth... I have a sister who's...into girls, and I would hate for her to think she'd have to hide who she was from me. I'd just want her to be happy. ♪♪ Mateo? We have a problem. Gigi knows you're the father. What? She had a paternity test done somehow. That's not possible. I saw the report. They had your blood. ♪♪ Gigi. Excuse me. Sure. Excuse me. Of course. [ Sighs ] I just spoke to Ingrid. Hmm. She told me everything. And I'm stunned. Mateo, you didn't know it was yours? Of course not. I never should have slept with her. She's been...trouble from the beginning. Well, that's funny. Because when I first asked you about her, you said she was a-an angel. I was wrong. If I find out you're lying, Santiago is gonna fire you on the spot. I doubt that very much. Really? I just think Santiago will believe me. He needs me here. ♪♪ Well, if you think this place is nice, you should see my hotel in Mumbai. [ Cellphone vibrates ] There's a tiger in the lobby. Excuse me. This is Finn. What? So, are you two here together? We work at competing hotels, Dad. It's not exactly "West Side Story". Oliver. I just heard the city shut down our construction site. We're opening in two days. Why would they do this now? Maybe you didn't have the right permits. That's what happens when you take shortcuts. You did this. Dad. You have no idea who you're messing with. Neither do you. ♪♪ Did you know what your dad was doing? No, I swear. But Finn could've avoided all of this if he had just played nice a couple hours. Alicia, I'm responsible for the grand opening. So if we don't open on time, that's my job. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, the -- Me too. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Scattered applause ] I have been looking for you all night. Where have you been? Just...working. Mm. Why, what do you need? A dance...with my son. Mom, that is extremely embarrassing. Tough. I am your boss, and I am ordering you to dance with me. Sorry Dad couldn't come. Me too. I know you're worried about him. It'll be all right. I take care of my boys. Hmm. I know. ♪♪ [ Sighs ] Don't let them bother you. You know that Ingrid is nothing but trouble. Yeah. It still hurts. You deserve better. Sometimes you just got to know when it's time to move on. What's wrong? I'm just not big on parties. I feel like everyone's staring at me. They are staring at you. I mean, you're the hottest girl in here. Why are you so nice? I don't deserve it. Of course you do. Ingrid, look... whatever happens between us, I want you to know that I am in this. When I, uh -- When I lost the leg, things got -- they got pretty dark. For a long time, I thought -- that's it. I'm never gonna have a normal life. You know? And I don't know. You know, seeing our kid on that screen yesterday, it really made me feel...hopeful. It's not yours. What? The baby. It's not yours. I made a mistake. Okay? I'm -- I'm so, so sorry. Please say something. Javi! ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Chuckles ] Hey. Hey. Come back to the gala, Helen. I'll send someone over with your things. Thank you. The Finn wants me to start tomorrow. They don't waste any time. So, they don't... suspect anything? They totally bought it. I'm in, baby. [ Laughs ] He thinks he's gonna put me out of business, hmm? Not with me working from the inside. I'm gonna make sure of it. Mm-hmm. Thanks for besting the offer. Of course. You're family, Helen. And Malcolm, too. And family take care of one another. ♪♪ Sazerac, please. Strong drink. I'm drinking to forget. I was having this...magical night with this amazing girl, and I totally blew it -- because of work. Tell me more about the amazing girl. Well, uh, we went to school together, and I had the biggest crush on her. You did not. I did. Alicia, I am really sorry that I overreacted tonight. Finn just drives me crazy sometimes. Oh, I know. I can't control my dad any more than you can control Finn. Mm. Thank you. Do you think we could never talk about work? Just be ourselves and leave the hotels out of it? Sounds good to me. Yoli seemed really wrecked about the whole Sky thing. But she could be lying. Yeah. It did seem like she went through a lot of heartache. [ Alicia laughing ] It seems like you know a thing or two about that, don't you? Look... I liked Ingrid for a year before I was ready to tell her. And when I finally came around, she was with somebody else. When you wait too long, the choice gets made for you. You're in love with her, man. Hi. Hey. I was heading out when I got your text. I didn't think you would come. I'm here. Okay, you were right. I did have an intense relationship with Sky. But I'm not hung up on her. I was hurt by her. Hey, she... She used me. What do you mean?
