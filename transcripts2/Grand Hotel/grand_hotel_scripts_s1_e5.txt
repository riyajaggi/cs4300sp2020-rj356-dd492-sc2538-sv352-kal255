 Previously on "Grand Hotel"... Ingrid from housekeeping? You got her pregnant? And that reaction is exactly why I haven't told dad. Whoa, whoa. Help. Help! What's wrong, baby? They found something. If you ever want to hang out sometime, I'm in. Like a date? Should we be doing this?

 Sorry I haven't called you back. When do you think you'll come back home? Soon. We'll pay whoever this is, and it'll be over. Mateo wouldn't sign the card, so I stole his trash. Wait, what's all this? Someone's blackmailing Mateo. ♪♪ [ Sighs ] You know, there's no reason we have to do this today. Wha-- Don't chicken out on me now. It'll be fine. Relax. Re-- Relax?

 I'm about to interrupt my dad's breakfast to tell him I'm having a baby with one of his employees. [ Scoffs ] Who has a name. It's Ingrid, and she's pretty cool. Once you get to know her. [ Elevator bell dings, doors open ] I mean, did you have to wear the uniform? Yes, because I'm working a double shift because I'm late on my rent. 'Cause your dad won't help us with the money because you won't tell him who I am. Okay. All right, little guy, cover your ears unless you want to learn how to... curse in Spanish. I'm two months pregnant. That "little guy" doesn't have ears yet. I know. Okay, eight weeks, it's the size of a raspberry. I've been reading a baby book. I didn't know you were such a big reader. It's an audio-book. [ Keypad beeps, door opens ] [ Door closes ] Gigi: Mm, Ingrid, finally. We called housekeeping an hour ago. Santiago made his famous chilaquiles, and the sink is full of dirty dishes. Santiago: I'm an artist. No one yelled at Diego Rivera for making a mess. [ Chuckles ] And just don't put them in the dishwasher. You really have to scrub, please. Santiago: Javi. Buen día, mijo. Morning. Want some breakfast? Um, no, thanks. So, as you know, I've been working down in maintenance. Yeah. I am proud of you. So, the money I'm making, it's -- it's not really enough to cover the expenses for, you know, the baby, the mom. I'm not writing a blank check to some...mystery woman. Who is she? Ingrid. This is a private conversation. The kitchen, please. Housekeeping has to give us someone else. That Ingrid, she's terrible. [ Chuckles ] So, Javi. [ Groans ] Who's the mother of my grandchild? [ Phone clicks ] Well, before I tell you, I'd just -- I'd like you to promise me it's not going to affect her job. She works here? Dios mío. Okay, I mean, if we're gonna be like that, then what's -- what's -- No, no, no. No, no, no, Javi, you slept with an employee? She could sue you. Or the hotel! Okay, you know what? Let's do it another time. It's me! Okay? I'm having his baby. Also, you're out of dish soap. ♪♪ ♪♪ I can't believe you. Gigi: It-- It's certainly... unexpected. H-How long have you two been -- W-We're not in a relationship. So you've broken up. Well, we were never actually together. Well, except -- except the once, yeah. A one-night stand. How modern of you. Um, my break is over, and Mrs. P will kill me if I'm not back in time, so... [ Sighs ] [ Door opens, closes ] Do you have any idea how reckless you've been? I didn't mean for this to happen. Oh. Maybe you didn't. What? No, maybe she slept with you because she wants our money. No, Santiago. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no. This is exactly why I didn't tell you. I'm not stupid, okay? I can handle my own life. ♪♪ [ Door opens, closes ] What? What? Don't -- Don't -- Don't look at me like that. I'm not gonna let that woman use him. It takes two to tango. You can't put all the blame on her. I'm just saying, Santiago, just don't jump to conclusions. Let's learn more about her. Fine. But I have to protect my son. So, the scans are back. Unfortunately, the news is what we feared. The cancer has spread. It's in both lungs. I recommend we start a course of chemotherapy right away. Jason: And that'll work? This is an aggressive form of cancer. I can't make any guarantees, but we'll hope for the best. No, not good enough. Helen. I don't want hope. I want results. Now, what would you do if this were you? Well, there's, uh, a clinic in Belgium. They've had some success with stem-cell therapies. It's a six-month treatment, still experimental. There's no way we can afford all that. You just leave that up to me. Santiago: 200 grand. I got it in hundreds. Will that work? [ Bag unzips ] I don't know. I've never been blackmailed before. Have they made contact? Not yet. But the deadline's tomorrow. I expect I'll get instructions then. All right. Remember I need that back by Friday. I took it from the ElRey ticket sales. Understood, but we don't know how this will go down. Or who we're dealing with, so... Mateo, the one good thing about having you around is that you fix things. So do your job. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Alicia. Hello? Honey? Hey. So, you heard your brother's big news. Yeah, he's gonna be a dad! Which is very irresponsible, and he should've been more careful. Yeah, he put the hotel at risk. So I want you to send a memo to the staff. Just, you know, remind them -- no inappropriate relationships between employees. ♪♪ But...do we really think we can control people's private lives? Tell them who they can and can't date? It's company policy. Well, why do I have to write the memo? Why not Mrs. P? She writes a mean memo. I want it to come from a member of the family, and who more perfect than you? My pride and joy. Thank you, mija. [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ Hey. You look bummed. You still upset about Ingrid? Nah, just -- just tired. [ Sighs ] What are you still doing here? I thought you had the early shift. Keeping an eye on Mateo. I figured I could follow him until I get a lead on Sky's disappearance. You're spying on him? The guy's being blackmailed for what he did to your sister. This seems risky. You don't think I know that? I-I can't sleep, thinking about what he might've done to her. Y-- You think it's easy to be around him when all I want to do is kill him? Watch yourself, okay? If you blow your cover, you'll never find out the truth. ♪♪ Here we go. ♪♪ ♪ 'Cause man a talk 'bout you fitness ♪ ♪ Fitness, fitness, fitness ♪ ♪ Man a pull up on your yard like a Jehovah's witness ♪ ♪ Witness, witness, witness ♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ Danny, right? From the hotel. Yeah. I didn't know you boxed. Yeah, I've been doing it for a while off and on. I could use a sparring partner. Get in the ring. Man: Yeah, yeah, give me ten. I got to wrap Mikey up. All right, I appreciate it. [ Grunting, heavy breathing ] Is that the best you got? You don't want my best. Trust me. Come on. You're making it too easy. It's like fighting with a girl. I wouldn't know. I don't hit women. Hey! [ Man chuckles ] Man #2: Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! Man, what the hell's wrong with you? You all right? I'm fine. [ Door slams ] [ Indistinct talking ] Wait, you knocked him out? I told you not to lose your temper. I know. I blew it. [ Door opens ] Nelson: Hey, guys. What's the haps? We're in the middle of something, Nelson. Oh, sounds juicy. Fill me in. It's a private conversation. Fine. I just came to give you a heads-up. Mateo's looking for you. [ Door opens ] Sit down. I didn't mean to hurt you, sir. I don't know what came over me. I do. You've got a short fuse. Where'd you learn to fight like that? Uh, I-I grew up getting bounced around in foster care, group homes. Had to learn how to defend myself. That wasn't self-defense. I'm your boss, and you knocked me out cold. You were fearless. Am I getting fired here? No. I like fearless. I'm gonna overlook this. Thank you. But you owe me one. And I will collect. [ Lighter clicks ] You know what? That's enough candles. You're gonna set off the sprinklers. Oh, I was trying to make it a little more romantic. [ Flame flickers, Yoli chuckles ] You know what would be romantic? What? A picnic in a park or a rooftop or anywhere that isn't this dinky little massage room. I thought you said it was hot sneaking around? It is, but not while I'm working. I mean, this is basically my office. Look, I'm just nervous about going public. My family, my mom... Trust me, I get it. But I'm not asking you to be out. I'm asking you to go out. [ Chuckles ] Like a movie or something. [ Groans ] It'll be fun. I'm sure we can find ways to have fun here. [ Chuckles ] ♪ Tell me what you want to do ♪ [ Knock on door ] Marisa, you've got a client waiting. [ Whispering ] Oh, no! Again. One second. Just finishing up! [ Muffled giggles ] ♪ I can't get you off my mind ♪ [ Indistinct talking ] [ Cellphone vibrates ] ♪ 'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt ♪ [ Cellphone clacking ] Danny. Hey. Hi. I'm glad I ran into you. Um, I'm guessing you read the memo I sent? Yes, I did. Should we even be talking right now? I just wanted you to know that it had nothing to do with our...kiss. My dad's just on a tear 'cause of this whole drama with my brother. So this is coming from your dad. Yeah, but it's not like he'll know what we're doing every minute. Mm. I'm sure we could still find ways around it. Alicia, if this is coming from the owner of the hotel... I-I can't -- I can't afford to lose this job. Oh, no, no, of course not. I wouldn't want that. I'm -- I'm really sorry. No, no, no. I totally get it. Company policy. I wrote the memo. [ Chuckles lightly ] So, um... guess...that's that. Okay, yeah. Okay. Okay. ♪♪ Come on. We've been paying for insurance for over 20 years, and we need it now! No, I will not hold! [ Door opens ] [ Exhales sharply ] Everything all right, Helen? Everything is fine. Do you have time to talk me off a ledge? Well, that depends. How high is the ledge? Javier got a maid in the hotel pregnant. Let me guess. Ingrid? Sit down. [ Indistinct conversations ] Mateo. You're the eyes and ears of this hotel, right? Eh, not my official title, but, yes. Then you probably know about Ingrid. What about her? Well, she's having a baby. And Javi's the father. What do you know about her? Besides that she's a god-awful maid. [ Chuckles ] That's true, but I think Ingrid's heart is in the right place. That woman is rotten to the core. She is selfish, entitled, lazy... I've always found her to be honest. She's a pathological liar. I think you can trust her. She's a bad, bad apple. You have nothing to worry about. Santiago thinks she's trying to trap Javi. [ Chuckles ] What's more likely, a housekeeper risks her job to trick the boss' son or Javi, who sleeps with everyone, slept with one more girl? You make a good point. You think she's the type of girl to trap my son? Let me put it to you this way. If I were you, I'd make damn sure that baby was really Javi's. [ Sighs ] ♪♪ Miss Mendoza? Oh, hey, Cathy. Please, call me Alicia. Alicia. You know that memo you sent about how we should report any hanky-panky? Pretty sure I said "inappropriate fraternization," but go on. So, I work in the spa, and there's this masseuse, Marisa. In between appointments, she's in that massage room fooling around with somebody. I figure they must work here because it happens, like, every day. Okay, well, let's not jump to any conclusions. Have you spoken to her about it yet? No, that's your job. Aren't you the sex police? Oh, my God, is that what people are calling me? Okay, I'll look into it. You're sure this interaction is sexual in nature? Uh, based on the sounds I hear coming out of that room, yeah, I'm sure. ♪♪ Ingrid? Mrs. Mendoza was asking a lot of questions about you. Oh, you mean Gigi? That's what she told me to call her when she invited me to lunch. I guess we're BFFs now. [ Breathes sharply ] [ Quietly ] Look, I covered for you, but eventually you will get caught, and I'm not going down with you. Carolina: Ingrid, right? Yeah. Come on. We have a table. My mom's waiting. She was right. You are really pretty for a maid. [ Phone clicking ] Ingrid, I wish you could have met both of the twins, but Yolanda had a spa appointment. She's been down there a lot. You would think they'd do something about those cuticles, hmm? I've worked at this hotel for three years, and I've never actually eaten here. Aww. Connie: Good afternoon, Mrs. Mendoza. What can I get you today? I'll have the usual. Chicken Caesar salad -- no croutons. Of course. Um, I'll have the side salad. Try the lobster club. It is divine. It's $32. Just bring her the club. And you know what? Wrap up another one to go. Okay, right away. Um, not that I'm complaining, but why are you... being so nice to me? Yeah, why are we being nice to her? Because I see myself in you. I remember, Ingrid, how hard it was to be a single mother. My ex completely abandoned me and the girls. That's not fair. It's more complicated than that. My dad didn't mean to hurt us. Why are you defending him? I just think there's two sides to every story. Not that story. He left us with nothing. I had to take a job as a cocktail waitress to pay the bills. You? Mm-hmm. We were so poor that I remember stealing orange slices from the bar. [ Chuckles ] Ew. Those were bar oranges? Yes. I-I grew up with a single mom, and she always seemed so overwhelmed. I don't...know if I can do this...on my own. You're not gonna be alone. We'll be here to support you. Thank you. But Mr. Mendoza didn't seem too happy yesterday. You leave it to me. He'll come around. [ Chuckles ] [ Door closes ] Everything okay in there, Doctor? Standard bachelor party hangovers. Two IV vitamin drips, some aspirin, and call me in the morning. [ Both chuckle ] Glamorous life of a concierge doctor, huh? [ Quietly ] I have a question. Mm-hmm? If a woman is pregnant, how early can she take a paternity test? As early as eight weeks. Are you in trouble, Santiago? [ Chuckles ] Not me. I suppose you know all our family secrets anyway. [ Whispers ] It's Javi. Oh. It's always something with him, isn't it? Mm-hmm. But I'm trying to fix it. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Thud ] Ow. What was that for? Thanks to you, Dad made me write that memo. Did you know people are calling me the "sex police"? [ Chuckles ] It's, uh, "Sex P'Alicia," and I may have started it. Well, you totally screwed things up for me and Danny. Mm. Give me that. I need it more than you. Okay, don't blame me. Dad's overreacting. He thinks that Ingrid's using me for my money. Well, how well do you know her? Wow, yeah, you would take his side. No, I'm not taking his side. I think he's just trying to protect you. Protect me? Or, uh, control me? ♪♪ [ Sighs ] Hey. Hey. I've been thinking about how we can pay for Dad's treatment. Really? He works in Facilities, so he's probably been exposed to a lot of bad things -- pesticides, asbestos. Maybe his cancer is the hotel's fault. Well, we don't know that. I mean, it could've been all those cigars he used to smoke. Well, I talked to a lawyer friend, and she said that if we sue the hotel, they'd probably just settle. We would get a huge payout. No. I couldn't do that to Santiago. You're not even gonna consider it? This hotel's financial situation is tricky. Santiago has shared some things with me, and... he's dealing with a lot right now. So is Dad. I know. But if we sue this hotel, we just might put them out of business. Why do you always put this place before your family? That is not fair. You and your father are my whole life. Prove it. [ Knock on door ] ♪♪ I can't have you in here. Why? Your step-sister. Someone heard us fooling around and reported me, and now Alicia's investigating me for inappropriate relations. Oh, my God. Did you tell Alicia? No. I would never do that. But thanks for worrying about me. I could lose my job here. I'm sorry Alicia's so uptight. It's not her fault. You're the one who made us sneak around. You wouldn't even let me come up to your room. What can I do? You need to talk to Alicia. You need to make this right. ♪♪ [ Keys clack ] [ Telephone rings ] Hello? [ Distorted voice ] Do you have the money? Yes. Room 404, 15 minutes. I'll be right there. No. Send somebody else. What? Why? You can't be trusted. Who am I supposed to send? It's not my problem. [ Phone slams ] [ Exhales sharply ] ♪♪ [ Cabinet closes ] [ Indistinct talking ] Remember that favor you owe me? Take this cart to room 404. That's the favor? Delivering room service? Don't ask any questions. Just leave it inside. You see anybody, grab them and bring them to me. What if they don't want to come? I saw you in that ring. You'll make them. You breathe a word about this to anyone, you'll be lucky if all you lose is your job. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Knock on door ] ♪♪ [ Keypad beeps, lock clicks ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Door closes ] [ Telephone rings ] ♪♪ Hello?

Not now, Nelson! ♪♪ [ Lockers slam ] [ Door opens, closes ] Guess who I just had lunch with. [ Liquid pours ] La Ingrid. She's actually... not terrible. [ Chuckles ] [ Scoffs ] "Not terrible." Just what I want for the mother of my grandchild. She's a sweet girl, Santiago. She just had a rough life. I'm surprised at you, Gigi. I thought you had better judgment. I just think this could be good for Javi. I know what's good for him, and it's not that gold digger. Don't call her that! Why do you keep attacking her? Why do you keep defending her? Because I know what she's going through, Santiago. When we got married, everyone called me a gold digger. Your kids still do. [ Sighs ] Mi amor. [ Ice cubes clink ] You are nothing like this girl. How would you know? You've barely spent five minutes with her. All right. Let's, um, invite Ingrid to dinner tonight. Thank you, Santi. Mm. I'm sorry I snapped at you. No, no, no. We're both just... doing what we can to protect this family. [ Chuckles ] Mmm. ♪♪ Yoli: Hey, Alicia. You look really cute. Did you do something different with your hair? Nope, same as always. Do you need something? Oh, no, not me. Um, my friend Marisa over at the spa. I heard you're doing an investigation on her? Inappropriate something-or-other. Mm, I'm not at liberty to discuss that. Can't you just look the other way? I know she'd never do anything wrong. I can't just "look the other way" because someone's your friend. Well, don't you think that's a little hypocritical? What is that supposed to mean? I saw you at staff drinks. Hanging all over your "friend" Danny. There is nothing going on between us. Okay, look, can't you just do me a favor? We're sisters, right? Okay, you're gonna pull the sister card? You and Carolina have never said one kind word to me. We're not sisters, Yoli. We're just two people whose parents got married. ♪♪ Mateo: Laundry chute? I ran down to stop them, but they were gone. I'm sorry. No. Thank you. And remember, not a word to anyone about this. ♪♪ [ Door opens, closes ] ♪♪ [ Phone clicks, beeps ] ♪♪ I mean, how did the blackmailer even know about the laundry chute? Plus, you need a key card to get into the laundry room. It has to be someone who works here. [ Locker opens ] Wait, you kept the birthday card? The one we got everyone to sign? Yeah, why? We can use it to compare the handwriting on the blackmail note. Here. Oh, my God. What? I know who it is. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Cellphone rings, clicks ] Santiago: Did you find the blackmailer? Who is it? I don't know. I'm following them now. Just get that money back. [ Indistinct talking, traffic passing ] ♪♪ That won't be a problem. [ Inhales sharply ] [ Bus engine revs ] ♪♪ Where's Nelson? He went home early. ♪♪ Yoli: Hey. Um, I spoke to Alicia... but she didn't want to hear it. I'm really sorry. I guess that makes two of us. ♪♪ Wow. Never seen you out of uniform before. Well, you did once. That's right. Wish I remembered that. Ingrid, welcome. Yes, and, uh, apologies for yesterday. My wife tells me I was being... An ass. I like to keep him humble. [ Chuckles ] It seems like you have your work cut out for you. [ Laughs ] Come, sit next to me. Come on. [ Chuckles ] Well, that's encouraging. Yeah, we'll see. [ Inhales sharply ] I need to talk to you. Can it wait 'til after dinner? No. Okay, what's so important? You were right about Marisa. She is having an inappropriate relationship. Yoli, I told you, I can't discuss that -- Alicia, please. This is really hard for me. Marisa... is having a relationship... with me. I-I didn't even... know you were...gay. Or...bi? I don't know... what I am. [ Voice breaking ] I'm still figuring it out. So promise me you won't tell anyone. Of course not. Especially not my mom. She would...freak. [ Chuckles nervously ] Really? Yeah. But you wouldn't get it, because you're... like, the favorite in your family. But I'm not. And I can't afford to give my mother any more... ammunition to love me less than her precious Carolina. You guys talking about me? Yeah, I-I was just asking Yoli how you get your hair so shiny. Avocado mask. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything for frizz. Come on. Dinner's ready. [ Footsteps depart ] Look, I know I don't deserve any favors from you, but I really like Marisa. I really like her. Please? ♪♪ [ Sighs ] A toast, for a grandchild. Well, Santiago's. I'm too young and fabulous to be a grandma. [ Light laughter ] And to Ingrid and Javi. You have our love and support. [ Glasses clink ] Salud. So, uh... does, uh -- does that mean you're gonna help us out financially? [ Quietly ] Mijo, it's not polite to talk about money in front of guests. So, Ingrid, uh, when's your due date? Oh -- So, um, when can we talk about it, though? 'Cause it's kind of a ticking clock, you know? [ Chuckles ] You're right. You're right. I was going to do this after dinner, but... Ingrid, family means the world to me, so I would like to take care of all your expenses. Seriously? Ingrid: Oh, my God. Thank you. [ Chuckles softly ] [ Papers rustle ] We just need to make sure the hotel is covered. This says that what happened was consensual and you won't sue us. No problem. Where do I sign? Thanks, Dad. Mm. Means a lot. Wait. You want me to take a paternity test? You don't mind, do you? [ Sighs ] ♪♪ Wow. ♪♪ I can't decide what's more offensive. You basically calling me a liar... No. Or you pretending to be nice to me just so that I'd sign this. I didn't know anything about that document. Ingrid: [ Exhales sharply ] You know what? Keep your money. If this is what being rich does to people, I don't want my baby anywhere near it. You're unbelievable. Okay, you always talk about protecting the family, well, now I got my own family to protect. [ Chair slams ] Come on. [ Door opens, closes ] Santiago, I can't believe you. Why do you have to control everyone? If she had nothing to hide, she would take the test. She walked away from the money. Give this up. You're gonna lose your son and your grandchild. [ Thumps table ] [ Sighs ] [ Both laugh ] Wow. No one speaks to my dad like that. That was awesome. What about you? I've never had someone stand up for me like that. I know it couldn't have been easy. [ Chuckles ] Well, you make it easy. ♪♪ [ Sighs ] ♪♪ [ Keypad beeps ] ♪♪ [ Footsteps ] [ Keys jingle ] We need to talk. Okay. Ow. Ow! You really thought you could get away with this? I was hoping. I'll take that. Okay, watch yourself, Mateo. You wouldn't want me telling everyone what you did. I never touched that girl. I know you didn't. But I also know who did, 'cause I saw the whole thing happen the night of the hurricane. Then why are you blackmailing me? 'Cause I did some digging when the cops just up and dropped the case. You paid them off. That's my job. I fix problems for the hotel and the Mendozas, but I don't know what happened to Sky. Now give me that. [ Cellphone vibrates ] ♪♪ [ Panting ] ♪♪ [ Tires screech ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Bystanders gasp ] Woman: Oh, my God! Is he okay? [ Indistinct talking ] ♪♪ Here. -Yeah. -Thanks. [ Sighs ] Any update on Nelson? Called the hospital an hour ago. He's still in the ICU on life support. At least he's alive. Yeah. If he doesn't make it, whatever he knows about my sister will die with him. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry, man. [ Sighs ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Oh, Yoli, wait up. I just wanted to tell you that I've completed my investigation of your friend Marisa, and she's officially been cleared of any wrongdoing. [ Gasps ] Her job is safe. Thank you. Just...going forward, maybe keep it off work premises? Duly noted. [ Inhales sharply ] And not that I'm not, like, super grateful, but I have to ask -- why are you helping me? Because you... trusted me. And you opening up to me like that? It was the first time I felt like we were actually sisters. [ Chuckles softly ] Just you, though. I'm not ready to claim Carolina. Yeah, I struggle with that myself. [ Both chuckle ] But it felt good to finally tell somebody. So, if you ever want to talk about that guy, Danny... Oh, um, thanks, but there's really nothing to talk about. The, uh, memo kind of took care of that. Wow. What? Mm, you're Alicia Mendoza. I've never seen you back down from something you wanted. [ Inhales sharply ] And now that we're sisters, I can tell you that it's pretty annoying... [ Chuckles ] ...but, uh, I've always admired that about you. Thanks. Yeah. ♪♪ What are you doing? You're supposed to be resting. I like working. It makes me feel normal. I know what you mean. [ Inhales sharply ] Did Jason talk to you? About suing the hotel? You know, he keeps asking me why this place is so important to me, and... I guess I just have so many memories. We had our first kiss in the break room... Mm-hmm. [ Chuckles ] And then Jason took his first steps in the lobby. Like a drunk baby giraffe. [ Both laugh ] But this place would mean nothing to me without you. So I think we should sue. And that money will help pay for your treatment in Belgium. Helen. I don't want to go to Belgium. Why not? You heard the doctor -- there's no guarantees. And I don't want to be away from you or Jason. Not for six months, or even six minutes. So, what, you're just gonna give up? No, no, no, I'm gonna stay here, and I'm gonna fight like hell. Now, this cancer's tough. But being without you? That'd kill me. [ Sighs ] ♪♪ [ Sighs ] Alicia: You okay? Hi. I was just thinking about Nelson. I heard. Are you guys close? Not really. [ Chuckles softly ] But it makes you realize it can all end so fast. Yeah. [ Sighs ] When you think about all the things you didn't do or...say. It's just so sad. So, um... [ Exhales sharply ] I've got to say this. I think there's something real here. And we shouldn't let some stupid memo stop us from seeing where it goes. I can talk to my dad. We can work something out -- Alicia, it's not just the memo. I really like you. My life is... [ Inhales sharply ] ...complicated right now. I'm sorry. Okay. Got it.

I know. Uh, I'm sorry. I've been...distracted. [ Chuckles softly ] But I'm here now. [ Footsteps approach ] You wanted to see me? Yeah. Come, sit. [ Exhales sharply ] I crossed a line last night. I'm sorry. I remember the day you were born, I was, um, scared to hold you, and the nurse said, "Don't worry. You won't break him." I'm not sure she was right.
