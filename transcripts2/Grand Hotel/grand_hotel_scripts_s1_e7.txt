 Previously on "Grand Hotel"... ALICIA: Oliver? (CHUCKLES) Alicia. Fantastic. Let's grab dinner tonight. Dinner is perfect. We're gonna be neighbors for years. I highly doubt that. I'm gonna put you right out of business. I never dreamed we'd actually get you. Welcome to the Finn Hotel. (GLASSES CLINK)

 They don't suspect anything? They totally bought it! I'm in! What's wrong? The baby. It's not yours. I'll see you upstairs. When you wait too long, the choice gets made for you. You're in love with her. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEERING) ♪♪ Spring Break, day one. Buckle up. You don't sound too excited. Well, we're gonna be working our asses off. These college kids are terrible tippers.

 Though on the plus side... there is that. Mm. Hey, you're a free agent now. No girlfriend, Alicia's with that Oliver guy... Yeah, I'm not looking to hook up. I just need to focus on finding out what happened to Sky. Good luck with that. They're gonna be expecting all of us to work doubles. PORTER: Danny! Hey, man, I'm flattered, but... Shut up. These need to go to the 14th floor. And I know, you're a waiter, but it's Spring Break... All hands on deck. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. "Alicia Mendoza"? Ow. You may not be looking to hook up this week, but somebody is. Alicia's new boyfriend. I got it. ♪♪ Danny? Oh. Hey, Alicia. Those are for you. But not from me. From Oliver. I'm guessing. I-I didn't read the card. Were you just running away? (CHUCKLES) No. I was... briskly walking away from a potentially awkward situation. Danny, it doesn't have to be awkward. You weren't interested, and Oliver is. Clearly. I mean, the red roses are a little on the nose, but it's the thought that counts. (SCOFFS) Well, I just think he's direct about what he wants, which I find so refreshing. Also, that sexy British accent does not hurt. So I guess it all worked out for the best. (DOOR CLOSES) ♪♪ ♪♪ (CHEERING) ♪♪ The pool is packed. Yeah. I hope they are drinking. Ah, it's college kids. On Spring Break. I think they're drinking. (CHUCKLES) Why are you so worried? We're at full capacity, EIRey is selling out every night... Finn says he's gonna put us out of business. I worked my ass off to get us where we are. Don't let him get under your skin. He's nothing compared to you. Hmm. So, have you thought about what I told you? Ingrid, the lying snake? And Mateo, the other lying snake? Well, Ingrid is pregnant. She could sue if we tried to fire her. But Mateo...? He says he had no idea he... he was the father. And you believe him? I'll talk to Mateo, I promise. Now come on, the kids will be here for breakfast. ♪♪ Hey, you. I love my flowers. Fantastic. Why are you whispering? I just walked into my dad's suite. Oh, he still doesn't approve of us? Well, he's not thrilled you work for his archenemy. But frankly, I find the whole Romeo and Juliet thing super hot. You know how that play ends, right? (CHUCKLES) I got to go. I'll talk to you later, Oliver. Oliver? Is that the boy from the hotel next door? I am not discussing my romantic life with you. Just don't tell him that their new Vice President is a spy. I promise I won't say a word about Mrs. P. Do you really think this plan is gonna work? Claro. If anyone can pull this off, it's Helen Parker. Oh. You use Pimlico as your produce vendor? Everyone says they're the best in the city. Why? Ah... it's none of my business. I'm sure you know what you're doing. No, no. No, that's why I have you here. You know Miami Beach. Who do you like? You know what? Why don't you let me pick out all your vendors? Put me in, Coach! (CHUCKLES) Mendoza was a madman to let you go. Hundred percent. By 7:00, then, honestly, we'll be fine with that. Oh, uh, terribly sorry. Are we early? C'mon in, boys, just wrapping up here. Oh, I didn't realize there was a staff meeting. I'm happy to stay. Nope. This one's just for the big dogs. You go out and make some hires already. We need a full staff. Oh, I am interviewing some people this afternoon, so... Like I told you, just go steal the best people from the Riviera Grand. That way, we got the cream of the crop, and Mendoza gets the shaft. Win-win. (CHUCKLES) Hi. ♪♪ Come, sit. Where's your sister? Not coming. She's still mad at you. How does she expect me to react when she came out in front of all those people? Everyone was staring at me, Caro. Maybe it wasn't about you. I guess I could've handled it better. I don't know. I-I'll talk to her. Good. She's here, she's queer, and you have to get used to her. SANTIAGO: Have you talked to your brother? Not yet. I'm a little worried about him. He was so excited about Ingrid and becoming a dad... I just hope he's not too devastated. (DOOR UNLOCKS) Spring Break! (DOOR CLOSES) Who's coming to the pool with me? Huh? Drinking at breakfast, mijo? What about work? Just taking some "personal time." Blowing off some steam. Right, of course. You've had a rough week, you're upset... I'm relieved. I'm not ready to be a dad. I basically dodged a huge bullet. But Ingrid... I thought... She did me a favor. She cut me loose right before Spring Break... It's like the best time of the year to be single. So, you nerds want to have any fun today, I will be in Cabana Seven. Ah... (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENS) SANTIAGO: Helen. (DOOR CLOSES) Did anyone see you? Don't be so paranoid. They think I'm just clearing out my office. How's it going? It's been kind of fun. Finn is letting me pick out all the vendors. I'm gonna surround him with nothing but idiots. (LAUGHS) So he really has no idea. Mm-hmm. Oh, and one more thing. Finn keeps hounding me to steal your employees, so I'm gonna have to hire somebody, or he's gonna start getting suspicious. Actually... There's one person I wouldn't mind losing. Seriously?! You want me to be the Head of Housekeeping? I always thought you sort of, you know, hated my guts. (LAUGHS) Why would you say that? Because you tried to fire me? (INHALES) That was tough love. To bring out your potential. Ohh. So this whole time, you've been grooming me? Sure. Well, it's actually a perfect time for me to be getting out of this place. Yes, I heard about the confusion with Javi and the baby. You did? I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Everyone's been talking about me and how I'm such a horrible person. Well, then, like you said... It's time for a fresh start. Do I have to wear one of those? Did I mention I'd be doubling your salary? It is so cute! Mm-hmm. Mm! You got a beautiful smile, girl. Whoo! Thank you. You're next, beautiful. Come here. And when we're done here, I need you to speak to my man about attending our after party. That sexy man right there. You see him? (LAUGHS) God, I love Spring Break! (CHEERING) Whoo! Got a half-strawberry, half-pineapple daiquiri for... Emily? Yes, that's me. Thanks. JASON: I'll take those. Hi. Remember me? You waited on me last year. Okay. Can you do something for me? I'm trying to get in touch with this woman who works in the kitchen. Sky. Sky Garibaldi? Yeah. She's not here anymore. Damn it, I-I really needed to talk to her. What do you need to talk to her about? (SIGHS) Nothing. It's fine. Hey! Emily, wait! POOL BARTENDER: Hey, Jason. Cabana Three. ♪♪ SANTIAGO: Hey! Bossman. Is the music too loud? You coming to shut me down? Just the opposite. I want to thank you. Although you are a pain in the neck, this is our best Spring Break ever. Mm! Bring it in for a hug, papi. Come on! That won't be necessary. (CHUCKLES) Look, you have helped us turn this place around. Yo! If there's anything I can ever do for you... Can I get my motorcycle back? No. (LAUGHS) WOMAN: Yeah. Dad, I know you were nervous, but we are kicking ass! We're overbooked, drink sales are up... SANTIAGO: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. What's happening? Go. Hold up. Hey, hey, hey, excuse me. Where is everyone going? The hotel next door. The Finn? $5 cover, all the booze you can drink! - We're out of here! - Wait a second. What? They're practically giving away drinks. You can't make money like that. Finn doesn't care about the money. He just wants to hurt us. And it's working. ♪ What what what? ♪ ♪ We got two cups ♪ Everybody's leaving. (SIGHS) I'm losing all my customers. Well, I found 'em. Heading straight to the bar. You should have warned me. That's why you're there. I know, and I'm trying, but Finn won't let me into his inner circle. This place is a total boy's club. Where are we on the debt? Well, Mateo's people expect a payment next month. But if this guy Finn ruins Spring Break, I won't make it. So then what are we gonna do? I mean, these kids, they come to Miami for two things... Booze and sunshine. And Finn's giving them both for free. Let's see if we can change that. ♪♪ (TIRES SQUEAL) Welcome to the Finn. Pool bar is right this way. Hey. I missed the part of the play where Romeo stabs Juliet in the back. So, you saw the flyer... And the hashtag. And the sky banner. You're actively coming for our guests. We're rival hotels... Isn't that kind of the deal? I guess. We talked about this, remember? We are not the Finn and the Riviera Grand... We are Oliver and Alicia. Look, if we're gonna make this work, we have to keep the business separate from our relationship. (SIGHS) You're right. I'm sorry. It's okay. Can I take you to dinner tomorrow night? We can go to your place. It sounds like you can use the business. (CHUCKLES) So, that's how you're gonna play this? Mm-hmm. Don't forget, guys, all the booze you can drink. So order top-shelf! - Yeah, she's right. - She's right! MAN: Yeah! She was super anxious about finding Sky. And when I said that she wasn't here, she got all weird and bolted. We've got to find her. Do you remember anything about her? Her name was Emily. That's a start. What else? Well, she ordered a half-strawberry, half-pineapple daiquiri. Which is pretty trashy, even for Spring Break. I mean something useful. She was blondish, cuteish, she was kinda sunburnt, and she had a lower-back tattoo. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) WOMEN: Cheers! Great. You just described half the girls here. GIGI: Yolanda, honey. I've been looking all over for you. Are you avoiding me? Why would I do that? Could it be the stabbing pain of your rejection? Yolanda... I'm sorry. You caught me off-guard. Okay? I needed time to... To process, you know? But I promise you that was not a reflection of how I feel. Really? You're my daughter, mami, and I love you and accept you completely. I don't have a problem if you're gay. I never said I was gay. I'm queer. Is... Is... Isn't that the same thing? No, "queer" means I don't believe in a binary nature of sexuality. I just like who I like. Wonderful! Yeah, that's great. (CHUCKLES) Um... So... Is it possible you could someday maybe end up liking a man? (SCOFFS) And there it is. That's the only way you'll be okay with it? If I end up with a guy? Of... Of course not, Yoli. I'm just trying... I-I should have known. ♪ T-T-T-Tables have turned-urned-urned ♪ (WHISPERING) I know you bitches are talking about me. (DOOR OPENS, INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Ingrid, I just talked to my mom. You're going to the Finn? Yeah, she got me a promotion. (CAN CLOSES) Which will be nice going some place where people aren't constantly whispering about how awful I am. You just made a mistake, that's all. Yeah. Story of my life. (CHUCKLES) I'm really gonna miss you, Jason. The Finn is, like, a hundred feet away. We're still gonna hang. Plus, I got mad babysitting skills. I swaddle like a boss, just so you know. I may take you up on that. Good. (CHUCKLES) This place doesn't deserve you. ♪♪ (DOOR OPENS) You're supposed to fix problems, not create them. How could you do that to me? To my son? I am as shocked as you are. I swear, I had no idea the baby was mine... Because of your mess, Gigi started to ask questions. About you and your position here. That's very dangerous, Santiago. (CHUCKLES) For all of us. You think I don't know that? I've been doing my best to keep her away from this. Look, I'm truly sorry. Let me make it up to you. How? Are you gonna get your people to forgive the debt? You know I can't do that. But I can have them handle your... Finn problem. (SIGHS) I know the way your people "handle" things. I'm taking care of Finn myself.

You're the only one who's seen her. Help me. (SIGHS) Nope. Nope. Not her. Nope. ♪♪ Where my Emilys at? (CHEERING) ♪♪ Welcome back. Welcome, welcome. Enjoy. Remember, we accept all of your parents' major credit cards. I want that eyesore gone today. Hello, Michael. You don't like our new billboard? Don't play dumb, Santiago. You know damn well it's blocking the sun from our pool. It's on my property. I have every right to promote EIRey. You're out of your league here, Mendoza. Hey. You may have more money than me, but you can't buy the sun. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) See, this is why I stopped working for you in the first place. You have no shame! ♪♪ He's gonna retaliate. I don't know how. But he's plotting behind closed doors. You have to get in there! I'll try, but that man will do whatever it takes to win. Well, that makes two of us. ♪♪ Emily, half-pineapple, half-strawberry daiquiri. Uh, I got this. Where's it going? - (LAUGHS) - Who's your daddy? - Yeah! - (LAUGHS) It's not me. I'm nobody's daddy. (CHUCKLES) I'll be all your daddies. (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) Oh. ♪♪ Got a drink here for Emily. Half-pineapple, half-strawberry daiquiri... Yeah, hi, that's me. Hey, I'm Emily. Hey! I thought I recognized you. Do I know you? Uh, yeah. We partied together last Spring Break. I'm pretty sure I'd remember somebody who looked like you. Nope. No. Do not get mixed up with this guy. This guy likes to string girls along and then blow them off when he gets bored. Right? Oh. What are you talking about? I'm talking about what you did to my sister. That's what I'm talking about. I'm sorry, what? What? You played Blanquita? You better swerve on out of here, boy. You heard him. Get out, waiter. Ooh, take it easy. No, no, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good. I'm good. (CHUCKLES) (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) WOMAN: Whoo! (CELLPHONE CLATTERS) Whoo! (BEEP) Hey, Javi, me again. Um, I know you're mad, but I was really hoping that we could talk. (DOOR UNLOCKS) Ingrid, what the hell?! None of the rooms on three are ready for check-in, and there's a major backlog of dirty towels in the laundry room! Um, you can blame the person in charge of laundry for that one. You're in charge of laundry. I am? I am! I'll get right on it! We can just do that. Okay. Helen. Yeah. What do you think of our new centerpieces? Oh. Very... orangey. Mm. That's because your produce vendor sent us 10,000 oranges... and nothing else. Well, that's odd. I'll sort it out. Oh! You know, I've been thinking about that Santiago Mendoza. I'd love to hit him where it hurts. What do you say we get together and come up with some ideas? Well, aren't you the "A" student? Yeah, I'm just trying to get in good with the boss. You free tonight? I'm watching basketball with some of the guys. Perfect. I love basketball! You do? Does Jordan have six rings? (CHUCKLES) All right, come to my office at 8:00. Okay. (EXHALES SLOWLY) Sorry I'm late. Crazy day. But I'm all yours now. So, you're not mad? Why would I be mad? Oh, I don't know, the whole "my hotel put up a sign "that cast a huge shadow over your pool" thing? Barely crossed my mind. I'm kidding. It totally monopolized my day. Which is why I'm sticking to our agreement... No hotel talk. Music to my ears. I can tell you how amazing you look, though, right? Aww. Remind me to compliment you more often. (CHUCKLES) I can come back later... Oh! No, no. Um... (CLEARS THROAT) Oliver, this is Danny, one of our best waiters. Danny, this is... I know who he is. He's the competition. The hotel's competition. Can I get you something to drink? Uh, I'll... I'll get a glass of the Cab. Ooh, let's share a bottle. ♪♪ So, where were we? (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) Sorry. Would you excuse me for a minute? Work emergency. Trust me, totally get it. ♪♪ This isn't a good time. Because I'm at dinner with Alicia Mendoza. No, don't worry. She has no idea what's coming. (CELLPHONE LOCKS) ♪♪ (SIGHS) We're gonna be late for our reservation. Sorry, I left my purse at Mami's... And I need it, because dinner's my treat! Okay, betch, but I'm getting lobster. Did you know where you left your purse, because... TOGETHER: Surprise! Um, what's happening? (SCOFFS) Who are these people? Well, just a few of my closest friends from the LGBTQIA community. Vénte, mamá. You remember Jackie, my trainer, right? She also identifies as queer. And have you met my hairdresser, Gregory? And his partner, Gregory. Mom. Yes? What the hell is this? Your coming out party! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ Man, there are so many Emilys. And those are just the names on the reservation. Doesn't include all the kids they cram into every room. (SIGHS) ♪♪ Thanks for the help. Alicia? Can I talk to you? Sure. It's about Oliver. (SIGHS) You need to be careful with that guy. I heard him talking on the phone. It sounds like he's plotting something. Like what? I'm not sure. But he definitely didn't want you to find out about it. Well, what if he was planning some romantic surprise and you just spoiled it? Yeah, it didn't sound like that. Danny, why are you trying to ruin this for me? I'm not. I'm trying to protect you. From what? An emotionally available guy? Alicia. I know what this hotel means to you. And you shouldn't be with someone that doesn't understand that. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Well, guess what? You don't get a vote. I'm trying to move on. So let me. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) ♪♪ Mira, this is Raquel. Look how beautiful she is. (CHUCKLES) It's nice to meet you. She's what they call a lipstick lesbian. I need a drink. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey. Why didn't you warn me about this? Your mom swore me to secrecy. (SCOFFS) And I kinda think it's sweet. "Sweet"? It looks like the set of "RuPaul's Drag Race" here. So stereotypical. At least she's trying. When I came out to my parents, all I got was a copy of the New Testament. (GIGI LAUGHS, TAPPING ON GLASS) GIGI: Ladies, gentlemen, and all of those who don't identify as either... (LAUGHTER) We're here to celebrate my incredible daughter, Yolanda. From an early age, I knew she had a spark in her that could never be denied. I remember her dance recital, when she was 9. During the group number, she felt a-a different "inspiration," so she breaks out into a solo. (LAUGHS) Soon after, all the other girls were following her lead. I have never been prouder of you... until today. To Yolanda. TOGETHER: To Yolanda! ♪♪ (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENS) Hey, Yoli, what now? It doesn't matter what I do, I just can't win with you. (CHUCKLES) I-I guess we finally have something in common. What do you mean? I threw you a party. I-I told that lovely story about... Carolina. (SCOFFS) That story about... how proud you were of me? That wasn't me. That was Caro. So... Oh, my God. Sweetie, Yoli. (BUTTON CLICKS RAPIDLY) I'm so sorry. You know... My whole life, I thought that maybe, deep down inside... you knew I wasn't totally straight, and that's why you pushed me away. But now I see... that was never it. It's just me you don't accept. Just... (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS, DOORS OPEN) Okay, okay, okay. Never have I ever... thought I was having a baby just to find out it was all a lie. No? Just me? All right. Mm. All right. (GLASS SHATTERS) Oh. Whoops. Party foul. Pardon me, ladies. Javi, come here. (CLEARS THROAT) Mijo. Hmm? How about we end the party for tonight? No, no, no, no, relax. I got it all under control. You were doing so well. I don't like to see you like this. (SIGHS) You know what, Dad? I... I don't want you to see me like this, either. Thank you. Party in my room, ladies! - Ohh! - Let's go. - Whoo! - All right. WOMAN: Sounds good to me. ♪♪ There she is. Y-You have to follow them. Why me? Because Javi won't let me anywhere near her. Just...

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Uh, just give me a second, okay? What's up? I just... I wanted to say that I'm... I'm really sorry. For what? No baby, no problems. I mean, I almost forgot how fun all this was. (SIGHS) Look, what I did was really, really screwed up. But what I was feeling... that was real. Javi, I was falling for you. Hmm. (SNIFFLES) Wow. You just can't stop lying, can you? (EXHALES SHARPLY) All right. (LAUGHTER) (DOOR CLOSES) (EXHALES SHARPLY) (CART ROLLING) Hey, Ingrid. What's wrong? (VOICE BREAKING) Nothing.

Smart man. 'Cause she's a lying bitch. You know, that baby is lucky you're not his father. (GASPING) (BOTTLES SHATTERING) Let's get out of here, Chloe. - Okay. - Let's go. Chloe?

Oh, I don't drink on the job. (CHUCKLES) Come on, relax. I won't tell anyone. I know the boss. (BOTTLE CLATTERING SOFTLY) You know, with all the research we did on you, none of it mentioned how beautiful you were. Mr. Finn, let's keep this professional, please. What, I'm not allowed to compliment you? (LAUGHS) You said you wanted to get in good with the boss? Well, this is how.

Son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill him. No, I've handled it. It's over, so just... let it go. No. Why? (STAMMERING) The man is a pig! We'll report him to the police. I can't put my family through that. Not with Malcolm's cancer and everything that we're dealing with. We can't let him get away with this. Do you see what happens to women who come forward? Against men with money and power? They get blamed. They get destroyed. It's not worth it to me, okay? And that's my choice. I never should have put you in that situation. You didn't. This is Finn's fault and nobody else's. Just please hire Ingrid back. I can't leave her over there with that man. All right. And I promise you, I'll find another way to take him down. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) I don't want to talk right now. Yoli. You were right. I do push you away. But it's not because I love you any less than your sister. Then why, Mami? (SIGHS) You remind me of your father. Ever since the day you were born, you were like a little Felix. Really? You smile like him, you argue like him... You even sneeze like him. (LAUGHS) He used to wake me up in the middle of the night. Ah-choo! (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHING) Like you. (SNIFFLES) ♪♪ But the truth is, I still have so much anger towards him. For what he did to us. I think I... Maybe I take it out on you sometimes. It's not fair to treat me like that. I know. I'm not him. No, you're not. You're my... incredibly thoughtful, intelligent, brave daughter who I love so much. And who I'm so, so proud of. I am, Yoli. ♪♪ (SOBBING) She called her Chloe? Not Emily? She's a college kid. She's probably using a fake ID. Of course. Cover for me. I'm gonna run the name "Chloe" through reservations.
