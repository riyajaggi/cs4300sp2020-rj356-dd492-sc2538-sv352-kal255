Well, she's not a doctor, but let her know if you need someone to kiss it and make it better. What? Santiago: Everyone, I have some fantastic news. The Biscayne Hotel has toxic mold. And that's fantastic news for... Us! The New Jersey Bombers come to Miami every year for spring training, and they usually stay at the Biscayne Hotel. But now... They have to find a new place to stay. Yes. That would be, like, what, 60 rooms every spring? Yep. That would be amazing if you could convince them. "If"? Have a little faith, mija, huh? I'm driving up tomorrow to their training camp. Hey, uh, Dad, do you mind if I join you? You want to come with me? On a business trip? Yeah. You know, uh, Derek Muncie from -- he was on my high school team? So, he's the Bombers' center fielder now, and, I don't know, maybe I could have some sway with him. Okay. Yeah, but we leave tomorrow early, okay, so go easy on the partying. [ Carolina chuckles ] Hey, Alicia. What are you doing today at 2:00? Why? Well, now that I am your supervisor -- Technically my supervisor. [ Chuckles ] Well, I think you and I should have a daily meeting so you can tell me what's going on with the ElRey residency. Well, I can just tell you now. We are sold out for the next month, room occupancy is up 20%, and it's basically a huge success. So, meeting adjourned? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come here. You are doing such a wonderful job, Alicia. But I am the Vice President of Special Events. And the ElRey concerts happen to be special events. So meeting not adjourned, and I'll see you at 2:00. Oh, my dream team, getting along, I hope. Of course. Actually, um, I think -- 'Cause nothing will make me happier if you two work out your differences without me.

I have work to do. ♪♪ [ Knock on door ] What's the emergency? Come here, mami. Come here. [ Door closes ] Feel that. [ Tapping ] No, thanks. It's stale. And I know it wasn't like that when my angel of a mother baked it. Okay, I don't know what to tell you, ElRey. We're already shipping them overnight from Los Angeles. Exactly. I don't want a day-old pastelito. Oh, you're right. Maybe we should just buy them a first-class plane ticket so they can get here the same day. That's crazy. They're just pastries. They can fly coach. ElRey, I have given you everything you asked for. A bigger dressing room, an assistant, a tank for your baby alligator. But I have to draw the line somewhere. Like, right here. Okay. You see, I thought you understood my creative process, but you know who does understand? Every other hotel on that strip that is begging me to go play with them and leave you guys in the dust. Okay. I have a discretionary budget for personal expenses. I guess I could swing a few plane tickets. Yes! But this is the last crazy request. I mean it. I'm putting my foot down. Damn, I love it when you get bossy, girl. And we're done here. Mm! I know why you wouldn't let me fire Ingrid. Javi Mendoza. They're in some sort of relationship, right? Mateo: Helen, you know I can't discuss Mendoza family matters. Of course, of course. You're too discreet. Just like I'm too discreet to say that boy needs to learn how to keep it in his pants.

It's good to see you, too. [ Engine rumbling ] I -- I, uh... [ Tires squeal ] I'm so sorry. I got to go. Oh, okay. Good talk. "Good talk"? Shut up, Alicia. ♪♪ [ Tires screech ] Um, Danny? Do you mind? [ Engine revs ] ♪♪ Danny: You have to admit, it's pretty suspicious. My sister disappears, and now Ingrid's driving around in her car? I mean, I guess it makes sense. Ingrid and Sky were roommates, so... Wait, roommates? And you're just telling me this now? Ingrid didn't do anything to your sister. She's a good person. If you got to know her, you'd see that. [ Quietly ] Okay, staff's going out for drinks tonight -- let's join them and invite Ingrid. Uh, she's not really a big drinker, so... Thank you. Dinner, too, then. Come on. You know you're dying for an excuse to spend time with her. 8:00. Palm Tavern. Count me in! I mean, I'll have to see if I can cancel my plans. What plans? We were gonna watch "The Bachelor." Uh, that's sweet. I-It's really more of a staff thing. Yeah. Yeah, lots of work talk, super boring. [ Water splashes ] He is so obsessed with me. [ Singing in Spanish ] ♪♪ [ Radio turns off, music stops ] Look, I know we don't get to do this a lot, b-but I think this is good, you know? It gives us a chance to -- to talk. Absolutely. There's actually something I -- Before we get there -- Sorry. No, no, that, uh... I don't want your lack of experience to get in the way of this deal. So I'll take the lead. Yeah. [ Radio turns on, singing in Spanish ] [ Indistinct talking ] Santiago: The way we see it, you have a world-class team. You need a world-class hotel. Yeah, one without mold. Look, I appreciate you driving out to see us, but these spoiled brats get picky when it comes to their digs. They're the ones you're gonna have to convince. Then that's what we'll do. Whoa! Mendoza? Is that you? Muncie! What's up, brother? Hey, what's up, baby? What's going on? Hey, yo, guys. Yo, you should've seen this dude back in high school. Only reason the scouts discovered me is they came to see Mendoza. Aw, come on. So, what happened? Oh, I'm sorry, man. I didn't know -- No, no, no, don't be. I got a pretty sweet life, so... Yeah?

What happened yesterday? We were supposed to meet. Oh, right. Um, do we really have to have a daily meeting? Apparently we do. Plane ticket from Los Angeles? You care to explain? Yes, that. We are flying in pastelitos for ElRey. Why? Miami has the best pastelitos in the world. Not according to him. These are made with his mami's love. I-I can't. Let's go to my office. [ Door opens ] Come in. Wait, you took my mom's old office? Yes. Do you have a problem with that? Because you didn't have a problem with the last four people who took her office. Now, can we please focus on ElRey? We budgeted his expenses at 10 grand a month, Alicia. He went through that in a week. I know. I am trying not to lose our cash cow to another hotel, and if you run a cost/benefit analysis -- which I did -- we're making way more than we're spending. ElRey is like a child -- the more you give, the more he'll take. One day, he'll bleed us dry. He needs boundaries. From now on, I'm gonna have to approve every expense before it's made, okay? Gigi, that -- that is absurd. [ Telephone rings ] Excuse me. Gigi Mendoza. Yeah, yeah. I have it here. [ Fading ] I didn't like it at all. Beatriz: One...two...three! [ Gasps ] It looks just like yours, Mami! That's right, Bunny! [ Giggles ] Go sit down. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] You know what I like most about my job? That I get to work with Papi.

I'll get you a motorcycle. And she's not my mother. [ Elevator bell dings ] We have an excellent gym, and we can grant you private access from 6:00 to 8:00 every morning. Man: Yeah, let's do this. [ Indistinct talking ] Excuse me. Javi, son. Huh? What are you doing? What? I just bet Muncie I could hit off their star pitcher. Loser buys drinks at our bar. You've got nothing to prove to these guys. Dad, it's just batting practice, okay? Besides I'm about to show these boys how it's done. Derek: Okay. Show him the heat! Man: Back up, back up! Man: All right, coach. Looks good. Whoo! Uh... Again. [ Groans ] [ Indistinct talking ] Javi. Uh, just... ♪♪ [ Bat cracks ] -Oh! -Oh, baby! Hoo, hoo! [ Bat clatters ] Look at that!

Okay, we'll see you then. [ Indistinct conversations ] Do you know who that man is? Mr. O'Connell? Yeah, he checked in yesterday. He's a repeat guest. When was the last time he was here? Um, looks like... ...oh, the night of the hurricane. I'm surprised he came back. We didn't have AC for a week. Maybe we should send him a basket of mini-muffins? "Great work, Nelson. Thanks for everything you do, Nelson." The ballroom can hold up to 400 people. Absolutely perfect for all of your needs. [ Motorcycle engine revs, crowd shouting ] Woman: Watch out! Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! Stop, stop, stop! [ Engine rumbling ] Are you crazy? You're gonna kill someone! Did you say something, mamita? I ca-- I can't hear you with this thing on. ♪♪ [ Rapping in Spanish ] Remember, this is not an interrogation, okay? So keep it friendly. Of course. You'll see -- Ingrid's a great girl. ♪♪ [ Dish thuds ] Thank you. Yeah. Ingrid, I really like your car. You don't see those older models much anymore. Um, yeah. I just bought it. I didn't know you were from Illinois. I'm not. Really? 'Cause your car has Illinois plates. Um... Yeah, no, my grandpa's from Illinois. He gave me the car. I thought you just bought it. I did. From my grandpa. Why are you so interested in my car? Just kind of a car guy. Mm. Mm. [ Quietly ] Yeah, she seems great. He said he needed a motorcycle to get around. How was I supposed to know that meant inside the hotel? You approved that motorcycle to spite me, Alicia. You can't handle the fact that your father put me in charge. Please, Gigi. He only gave you that title to humor you. Or maybe he did it to keep you in check, Alicia. Because you think that two years of business school means you know everything. I know that if we don't keep ElRey happy, he'll walk. That's not the point. You defied a direct order from your superior. If you were any other employee, I'd suspend you right now. Actually, you know what? I am gonna suspend you. What? Maybe now you'll take me seriously. I can't believe you're doing this. No, you know what? Actually, it makes perfect sense because you just seem to love taking everything I care about and ruining it. Don't be so dramatic, Alicia. I'm just trying to save the hotel, same as you. You know what, Gigi? I have eyes, so I get what my father sees in you, but, honestly, I have no idea what my mother ever did. How were you two even friends? Because I kept her secrets. What the hell is that supposed to mean? You have no idea what she put this family through. You put your mom on a pedestal, but the truth is, you didn't know her at all. ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] I want to make a formal HR complaint against an employee. Gigi Mendoza. On what grounds? Abuse of power, wrongful suspension, general bitchiness. Honey, you gave a motorcycle to a moron. I would've fired you on the spot. [ Sighs ] I know. I know it was stupid. I was just trying to get back at Gigi. Hey, she said something about my mom. That she had "secrets"? Honey, you know Gigi. She was just trying to stir you up. Don't let her get to you. Carolina: Hey! What do you think? Too flashy for a first date? Not at all. There's still part of your boob that you can't see. [ Chuckles ] Well, I just hope Danny likes it. Danny, the waiter Danny? Oh, that's right. You know him. He invited me to drinks. Staff drinks. A lot of people are going. Addie, Vance from accounting, Jason's bringing Ingrid... Oh, God. So we're basically crashing their party. Yoli, vámonos. I should've eaten you in the womb. Have fun making spreadsheets or whatever it is you do. ♪♪ I actually was gonna make a spreadsheet.

No longer possible. Yeah. ♪♪ Well, this could be fun. You and me hanging out at a bar, bonding -- Has Danny noticed me yet? He can't stop staring at you. Jason told me you lived with a girl who went missing? That had to be hard. Super hard. Okay, let's not make Ingrid relive a difficult time, okay? Difficult? I mean, she doesn't seem too beat up about it. Excuse me, Sky and I were very close. Or as close as anyone could get to her. What does that mean? What is with you? Why are you giving me the third degree? Morbid curiosity, I guess. Well, it's creepy, and I don't want to talk about it. Don't let them take my plate. What the hell, man? Danny! I got us beers. Oh, that is so thoughtful. Uh... Oh, uh... Oh, you're so nervous around me. You know what? Let me run and clean up. You spilled on Ingrid's purse on purpose. So you could snoop. Way to keep up. I told you Ingrid has nothing to hide. Then why does she have my sister's credit card? ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] Santiago: I promise you, this is the best deal you'll get in all of Miami Beach. What do you say? We'll shake on it. Look, the place is great. Like I said, it's up to the team. [ Laughter ] Guys, guys, guys. I'm not kidding, okay? Sports Illustrated shot their swimsuit issue right out there. -Here? -Yeah. And, you know, when the models were done, I hosted a little after-party in my room... [ Laughter ] Man: Of course you did. Well, at least until the cover girl kicked all the other models out. [ Laughter ] Hey, what'd I tell you guys, huh? Legend. -Okay, okay! [ Glasses clink ] Ah, you'll see. Hey, hey. You'll see -- stuff like that always happens at the Riviera Grand. [ Indistinct talking ] What are you doing with my stuff? Sorry, we spilled on your purse. Why do you have this? [ Sighs ] Okay, look, I know it looks bad, but I only use it for emergencies. And full disclosure -- that car you saw me driving? It's Sky's. But I only use it when I'm running late for work. Sounds like a girl went missing and you reaped the benefits. Screw you. Sky could be tough, but we were friends. We always looked out for each other. I even covered for her when she couldn't pay her share of the rent. Then why are you using her stuff? We always used to share things. And...maybe I'm holding on to the idea that she could come back. ♪♪ Sorry we jumped to conclusions. It's fine. I should probably move on anyway. Find a new roommate, get rid of her stuff. Except for this top. It's expensive. So, I'm gonna get us another round. Yeah. I told you Ingrid was a good person. Mostly. Yeah, she's a gem. She did keep all of Sky's stuff in her apartment, which is amazing. Why? Because I'm going there right now to look through it while you stay here and keep Ingrid occupied. No, no, you're not breaking into her apartment. You heard her. She's getting rid of my sister's things. I found that key in Sky's locker. I need to see if it opens anything. Don't push me, okay? I don't have to keep your secret. Okay. Now, I am gonna enjoy Ingrid's company. [ Chuckles ] You sure about that? ♪♪ [ Exhales sharply ] I am gonna die alone. What are you doing here? What, I'm not allowed to hang with my staff? [ Chuckles ] Yeah, they're terrified of you, so good luck with that. I got to get back to Ingrid. What's your rush? Oh, have you met Addie, from reception? Oh, God, what did I do? What don't you do? You are amazing. Did you know that Addie was working full time and putting herself through grad school? I did. It's where she met her boyfriend. You can go. [ Exhales sharply ] ♪♪ Can I buy you a drink? Sorry, I'm actually on my way out. Oh, come on. You're always running off somewhere.

Uh, looking for you. When I stayed here during the hurricane, you gave me your card, asked if I was getting "excellent service." You ask all your guests that? Yes, that's -- that's my job.
