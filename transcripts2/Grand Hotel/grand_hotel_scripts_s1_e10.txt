 Previously, on "Grand Hotel"... Maybe we should just be more open about our relationship. We're together. Danny: I feel like I caught a break. No one's gonna blow my cover. I'm checking in. My name's Heather Davis. Your ex-husband should be in prison. Innocent people trusted him with their money. You stole money from Santiago! I reached out to Santiago as a friend.

 I want to speak to your boss. I talk to them. Not you. This is the mysterious lender you've been warning me about? You have no idea what that woman is capable of. Good evening, Thomas. Did you bring me my package? Yes, ma'am. Special delivery. Hi, there, hon. You comfy? I'm sorry. What's that? You got my message? Ah...

 I-I'm sorry, Theresa. I'm sorry. Do you remember the life you had before we met? You had nothing. You were nothing. And look at you now. Well, not right now. Right now, you look kind of pathetic. But I've put a lot of time and effort into turning you into the man - you are today. - I know. - And I expect your loyalty. - You have it. - No more surprises. - Yes. Anything happens in that hotel, I want to know. You work for me. Understand? Yes. Yes, I do. If you have any doubts, I know about that maid you've slept with. Be a shame if something happened to her. Please, there's no need for that. Drive him back to the hotel. Take the bumpiest roads. *GRAND HOTEL* Season 01 Episode 10 *GRAND HOTEL* Episode Title: "Suite Little Lies" - ♪ Oh, I'm tryin' ♪ - Would it be unprofessional to try and hold your hand in front of all the guests? I'm trying not to, but it's hard. Have you ever been so happy your cheeks hurt from smiling so much? You've been grinning like that all morning. Carolina asked me if you were drunk. Carolina is so funny. Okay, now I'm asking. Are you drunk? Oh! Budget meeting with Mrs. P. See you later? That's two for dinner tonight. Oh, excuse me, please. Hi, I was wondering, could you tell me when Danny Baron is working? - He's a waiter here. - ♪ Guess I'm a bad liar ♪ Mi vida. Have you seen my gray suit? You're wearing it. Not this one. The other gray suit. It's missing from the closet. I don't know, Santiago. They all look the same anyway. Okay, ya me voy. I'll see you later. No... no breakfast? Well, you're picking up Javi from rehab, so I made plans with the girls. Mi amor, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the loan. But no more keeping things from you. Sounds like a wonderful idea. So, I really appreciate you letting me come back to work here, and I swear, I'm doing a great job. Mm, what did you do now? Well, there's a room on my floor that I didn't know I was supposed to clean. Ingrid, you clean them all. It is not that hard. But this one doesn't even have a room number. It's where 606 would be. Forget that room. No one has stayed in that room in years. I'm not so sure about that. My name is Danny. I'll be your server. Can I start you off with... ah... Heather. Well, hello to you, too. We got 10 minutes before the shifts change and then this place gets really busy, so... Danny! It's been months. Aren't you at least a little happy to see me? Showing up here was a bad idea. Are you trying to blow my cover? No, I would never do that. But I had to see you. You broke up with me over the phone after two years together. I know. I'm really sorry I had to do it that way. I... No, you've been so crazy worried about Sky and there I was, pressuring you to come home. I should've been more supportive. And I will be... from now on. Wait, Heather, did you come down here to try and get back together? I thought maybe if we saw each other face-to-face... No. No. We can't just pick up where we left off. Why not, Danny? When you love someone... Because... It's complicated. I'm really sorry you came all this way, but... you should go home. - Javi! - Hey! I'm so glad you're home. And I'm proud of you, mijo, - for getting clean. - Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be good to get back to normal life. With some restrictions. Your counselor briefed us on what to expect from outpatient treatment. Your sister and I want to make sure you don't slip up. Well, this is gonna be fun already. Oh, Javi! - Hey! - Hey! - Welcome home. - Thank you. Hey, so sorry to break up this, uh, happy family reunion... Oh, no, please break it up. Oh, in that case, - a word, Santiago? - Yeah, sure. Housekeeping has reported some... strange activity on the sixth floor in room 606. So, no alcohol or drugs. Obviously. And no sex. What? I think you heard me. No, in rehab they said no relationships. Your counselor was very specific. Sex can trigger a relapse. Fine. But you are depriving the female guests of one of the hotel's best amenities. I think they'll manage. Doesn't Santiago have any casual clothes? I mean, buying a polo shirt wouldn't kill the guy. Or would you prefer an orange jumpsuit? You get what you get, Felix. I think you look handsome, Dad. Thank you. Look at this, huh? Look at us! I've got my family back together. You don't. What is your plan, exactly, Felix? Because you know can't stay here forever. Mami, can't we just enjoy this? We're all finally together, and it feels really nice. It might feel nice, mi vida, but it's not real. You guys remember when we went parasailing in Hawaii? Yes. Mom hated it. She had her eyes closed the entire way up, - screaming like a lunatic. - Yeah. "Ay... Ay, no! Ay... Ay, no, no!" But when you got to the top, you opened your eyes. It was magical. It was peaceful, beautiful. All that fear for nothing. Gigi... There's nothing to be afraid of, hmm? 606 has been out of service forever. Why would I put a guest there? I don't know. No one's supposed to be in that room. I'm sure it's nothing. You're the only one with a key. Apparently not. Santiago. What is that criminal doing here? Nice to see you, too. I didn't lie to you about Felix. I just didn't tell you he was here. Oh, don't play games. You kept this from me! You're lecturing me about keeping secrets? That's pretty ballsy, even for you. He is in that room, Gigi. How could you let him stay there? I didn't. The girls put him there. Yolanda had the key somehow. I'm gonna call the police. Like you did 10 years ago? Yeah. Felix told me you're the one who turned him in. He stole millions. Not just from me... From many others. Why does it matter who blew the whistle? Because you ripped my family apart! I had no warning, Santiago! I had nobody to help me or the girls! I helped you. Yeah. You lit the fire, and then you swooped in and put it out. What a hero you are! This is what that man does! Twist things! We need to call the authorities. The girls have been hiding him. They could be charged with a crime. Do you want to destroy my family again?! I thought I was your family. I understand, but I can't afford it, so I don't know what you want me to do. But you did agree to this when you made the reservation. - I apologize, ma'am. - Everything okay here? Um, this guest would like to cancel a reservation early, but... There's a fee that I can't afford and I made an idiot out of myself and I really just want to go home. Uh, Paul, why don't you let me handle this? Um... look. I'm not supposed to do this, but I can waive the fee. Oh... thank you. I made this grand gesture of driving down from Illinois to win back my boyfriend, and he didn't want to be won back. Apparently it's "complicated." You will not believe this. A few weeks ago, I was you. This guy I was into gave me the same line. - "It's complicated." - Really? Yeah, and now we're together, and we're so happy. Boys are just so stupid. Sometimes you just need time and patience for them to figure it out. Hey, look, why don't I comp you a couple nights? What? Why would you do that? Because I love love. And maybe this dumb guy just needs to remember how great you are. When I first arrived, I found these in Sky's locker... An obituary for Santiago's first wife. Why would your sister have this? I'm still working on that. And I have no idea what that key is for. I had some other leads, but they haven't panned out. Well, take a look at this. Mateo has a record? You said he paid my partner off to close the case, so I looked him up. Armed robbery, assault and battery, resisting arrest. Yeah, but then it all stops. He's been clean for years. Well, maybe he just got better at covering his tracks. Listen, I want you to keep an eye on him. Whatever happened to Sky, I don't think Mateo did it. He was just part of the cover-up. So who is he covering for and why? How does a guy like that get hired as a senior manager at a five-star hotel? Yeah? Trash pickup. Can I come in? How... How have you been? Better. Thank you for being there. At the hospital with me. It was the least I could do. What you went through with the baby... If you need more time off, I... That's sweet, but I'm okay. Mateo, I know we've had our issues, but with everything that's happened, I was just really hoping that we could start over. Friends? Don't read into my kindness, Ingrid. We're coworkers. That's it. Thanks for getting back to me, Theresa. There's a situation with the Mendozas I thought you should know about. Javi, can I get you a drink? Sparkling water, cranberry juice? Ah, my family got to you, huh? Yeah, there was actually a company-wide "Javi's back from rehab" staff meeting. I'm joking. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Uh... I'm sorry that I took a swing at you before I got carted off. You know, it was just the whole Ingrid situation had me messed up, and... I shouldn't have lashed out at you. No, it's cool. You missed. Still pretty. Well, that's debatable. But I do owe you one. To the future Mrs. Freund. You're gonna make the best wifey ever! Cheers! Cheers! That's the hottest bachelorette party I've ever seen. They just got here today, and they're all cheerleaders. Pro football. Oh, you got to be freaking kidding me. Nope. Hey, uh, Jason. Can we get a round of lemon drops? Charge it to Vanessa Clark in room 716. Sure. Hey, um, why don't you... make one for yourself and come join us? I'm sorry. It's against company policy. Okay... No, no, no, no, no. Hey. Dude. What? What are you doing? That girl's a total dime. She's into you. Nah, she was being nice. Nice? And Santiago was pissed! I mean, the second he saw our dad's face, his eyes started bulging out of his head. - You should've been there. - Mm, I'm kind of glad I wasn't. All this family drama is so stressful. Marisa, would you be a doll and work on this knot? Can you stop asking my girlfriend to rub you? It's her job. She's a masseuse. Who's on her break. Look, I don't know how much longer my dad's gonna be here, but I'd really love for you to meet him. Your dad's a known criminal and, like, I don't want to be involved. Marisa, you have to believe us. He's innocent. Honestly, I wish you guys never even told me he was here. Honey, no one's gonna find out. You can't just swing by to say hi? I don't want to meet your dad, okay? Leave me out of this. Whoa. I want it to be as romantic as possible. Can you help me with these rose petals? Did Mateo ask you to do this? 'Cause it kind of seems like a VIP guest services thing. No, I just kind of connected with this guest. How did Mateo come to work at the hotel? What's his story? I'm not sure, really. My dad hired him while I was still in school. - Your dad hired him? - Not Mrs. P? Isn't that a little unusual? Why do you ask? I just... wondering what it takes to become a manager around here. A man with ambition! Sexy. Well, this place looks amazing. It's one lucky couple. You should hear this poor woman's story. She drove all the way down from Illinois to come and surprise her ex. I guess they dated for, like, two years, and then he just dumped her out of the blue. Oh, that's, uh... that's horrible. I... I think we should go now. I'm not quite done. No, it's good enough. Come on! Let's go. - Why are you being weird? - I'm not being weird. I just feel like we shouldn't be interfering in people's lives, that's all, Danny. Heather. Wait, do you guys know each other? He's my boyfriend. He's my boyfriend. Alicia, can you... Can you please just slow down? Okay, I just want to explain. No need. It's actually very clear. You've had a girlfriend this whole time. I did. But the moment I met you, I... I've never felt that way about anyone in my life. Oh, so that's why it was "complicated"? I-I was stuck between my feelings for you and my history with Heather. But I ended things with her weeks ago. Why didn't you just tell me? Because I guess I didn't want to hurt either of you. Well, congratulations. You hurt us both. Don't follow me. Relationships are built on trust, Danny. And right now, I can't trust you. I convinced Santiago not to call the police, but you can't stay here any longer. Mami, we can't just kick him out. Yolanda, por favor. Alright, look. Your mother's right. We all knew this wasn't gonna last. Just... Gigi, give me one more day, huh? I'll call in a favor, and I'll be out of your lives. Where are you gonna go? Somewhere out of the country. So does that mean that we're never gonna see you again? Well... unless you come with me. You've got to be kidding me! No, the girls said it themselves. Our family's back together. I'd like to keep this going. I mean, I've always wanted to spend a semester abroad. You have to go to college for that, sis. Girls, can you give your father and me a second alone? Please? What is wrong with you? - What? - Asking them to go with you. Not just them. You, too. After all these years, all the places I've been... I've still never met anyone who comes close to you. Knock it off, Felix. The charm isn't working. I'm married to Santiago. Are you happy? I don't care where you go, but you can't stay here. There he is. There he is, right there. The man of the hour. Now, he doesn't like to talk about it because he's brave and he's modest. Your friend says you're a volunteer firefighter? Um... Um, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And tell her about all the, uh, puppies that you saved. Oh, my God, I love puppies! Oh, my God, she loves puppies! It was a gas leak at... At an animal shelter, and Jason here, he saved the whole kennel. Okay. I'm not a firefighter, and I'm allergic to dogs. So this is gonna be on the house, okay? - You're a pig. - Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're welcome. Dude, get a hobby. Dude, you are my hobby, okay? When someone gets sober, they got to find things to do instead of using. Right, right? I'm supposed to "give back." So I'm giving back by getting you laid. - I don't need help getting laid. - O-Oh, you don't? "Oh, I'm sorry, hot girl. I can't drink with you because it's against company policy." I mean, dude, if I can't hook up with one of these hotties, someone else has to. Okay? Please let me do this for you. Beautiful view you've got out there. Mateo was kind enough to let me in. You had no right. Oh, come on, Santiago. You surprised me on my turf last time around. Now it's my turn. Surprise. This is my home. And without me, you wouldn't have a home. Don't forget that. I hear you're harboring a fugitive? Why would you tell her that? I don't answer to you. - Look, I'm sick and tired... - Oh, come on, boys. Don't make me get out a ruler and start measuring. The point is, this could be a golden opportunity. A golden opportunity? Felix Renna is legendary. He has stolen millions, and I would love to get my hands on that money. You and me both. If you were to hand Felix over, I would consider forgiving the debt you owe to me. Do we have your attention now? Why would you be willing to do that? You owe far less than Felix has stolen. I'd make a handy profit. I... need to think about it. I don't know what there is to think about. You get rid of Felix, you get rid of me. I don't see how you could say no. You know, I went around and around about why we broke up. I blamed the distance. I blamed the investigation. I never once thought it was another woman. I should've been honest with you about Alicia. She's not the reason we broke up. Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better. Heather, you are the closest thing to family I've ever had, and I will always appreciate that, but meeting Alicia... it made me realize there was something missing between us. And you found that something with her? We were happy until you came here. It's this wild goose chase after Sky that's changed you. It's not a wild goose chase. Danny, it's been months. On some level, you have to know she's... probably gone. Maybe. But this is the closest I have gotten to finding out what happened to her. So I am begging you, please... Don't tell Alicia. Wait, she doesn't know you're Sky's brother? Oh. So, this relationship that you have with Alicia that's so much better than ours... And she doesn't know why you're really here? God, I almost feel sorry for her. ♪♪ Javi has been spending a lot of time at the bar. He's not drinking, is he? That boy needs a distraction. He's found one, trust me. Hold on a second. You must be the infamous Mrs. P. I have heard so much about you. You have? This is Theresa Williams. She's... an investor in the hotel. Oh. It's my pleasure. I'm giving her a tour of the property. Yes, I... I like to make sure I am getting the most out of my investment. Is this your son? Yes. You're a waiter here, right? Yeah, I'm Jason Parker. Good to meet you. Oh, nice to meet you. I just think it's wonderful that this is a family-owned operation. Good. Good. Look, I'm sorry, but, uh, we have to get back to work. Oh, of course. You just keep doing a bang-up job, Helen. ♪♪ She seems nice. Stay away from that woman. - Hey. - Hey. Can we talk? Not if it's about your dad. You've been acting weird since he got here. Yeah, it's not every day that your girlfriend's hiding a fugitive. I don't really know the protocol. Neither do I. So, he's leaving the country. And I am... I think I want to go with him. At least for a little while. - Yoli. What? - I haven't seen him in a decade. I'm not ready to say goodbye. Besides, it's not like it would be forever. Just... an extended vacation. I was actually hoping you'd come with me. Oh, my God. Come on! Come after I'm settled in. It's not like you have to do anything illegal. But we'd get to be together. I can't leave my whole life to go on the lam with you and your dad. You know, when you were pressuring me to come out, all you wanted was for me to be "open." And now that I am, now that I've shared this huge family secret... all you want to do is judge. I'm not judging anyone. I just can't go with you. I'm trying to include you in my life! Please don't make me choose between you and my dad. I think you already did. So... Mr. January. Where do I get my hands on your big... photo spread? Excuse me? The Men of Miami Beach Calendar? Your buddy told me about it. Okay. Excuse me for just one minute, okay? ♪ I know it's hard to resist ♪ You're welcome. I'm not here to thank you. You'll thank me in the morning. I should've been more clear. I don't lie to women to get them into bed. Well, you got to do something because this whole "aw, shucks," nice guy thing... - It's not working. - You don't know me, bro. Okay, look. You got no edge. You got no swagger. You're... You're... You're too available. Girls like it when you're available. No, no. God, no, they don't. Do you want to get stuck in the friend zone forever? And... how would one get out of the friend zone? Ha! You're hung up on somebody. I knew it. It's Danny, isn't it? Makes sense. - You guys hang out a lot. - Yeah, shut up. It's Ingrid. Yep. I was drunk but I'm pretty sure I tried to punch you because you defended her. - Maybe I was into Ingrid... - Okay. But I'm trying to get over that now. Come here. The best way to get over somebody... is to get under somebody else. Picking up what I'm putting down here? Yeah. That was not subtle at all. ♪ I can't get you off my mind ♪ What's got you in a funk? Come on. Yesterday, you were walking around with that big, goofy smile, and now you look like you got the weight of the world on your shoulders. I found out Danny's been keeping things from me. Hmm. That was a loaded "hmm." It's your personal life. I don't want to butt in. What are you talking about? You love butting in. Do you know something? When Danny first started, he lied on his résumé. What, like, exaggerated his experience? Like he made it all up. I was all set to let him go, but then he broke up that fight at Carolina's wedding. Your father wanted to keep him. Why would anyone fake a résumé just to be a waiter here? Santiago. Did you come back for your suit? It's a little tight, actually, especially in the shoulder area. I came to give you one more chance. Where's the money you stole? I lost it. I told you all this. If you'd given me a little bit more time... Save it. That might have worked with Gigi and the girls, but I'm not falling for it. Where is it? I can't help you. Other people are looking for that money, too. If I hand you over to them, they won't ask so nicely. "Other people"? Is that a threat? It's a lifeline. If it were up to me, I would throw you to the dogs. Why don't you? For Gigi. So, Gigi sent you here to threaten me and then hand me over to these... ominous people that you're mixed up with? You're not gonna twist this. This is about what you stole from me. No, this is about what you stole from me. Gigi's what you've been after all along. Oh, I saw the way you used to look at her. In fact, that's why you called the feds on me, isn't it? - No, I called them to... - To get me out of the way. And that's why you did what you did to Beatriz. Hmm? Keep her name out of your mouth. Come on, man, you married her. And you got this beautiful hotel free and clear. You know, usually it's the woman who marries the man for money, but... to each his own. That's... That's enough. I'm not gonna listen to the ravings of a con artist. Oh, really? That's rich. That's rich since you're the ultimate con artist of all. Yeah. A young woman like Beatriz doesn't die of a heart attack. You can tell me. It's just us. You killed her, didn't you, hmm? You killed your wife. ♪♪ What did you do to make him so angry? Nothing! He flew in here in a rage and... talking about how he's gonna hand... mm... Sorry. It's alright. He was talking about how he was gonna hand me over to... dangerous people. He said what? This place isn't safe anymore. And I'll tell you, if he ever hurt you or our daughters... He would never do that. Felix, Santiago is a good man. Would a good man do this? Gigi, you've spent so many years just thinking I'm the bad guy and that he's your savior, but what if... you've got it backwards? You really think Heather's gonna blow your cover? I hope not, 'cause if Alicia finds out, I don't know what happens next. Jason? This Pinot you recommended was divine. This is for you. Oh. Wow. That is very generous, but I really can't. Oh, no, it's my pleasure. I like rewarding exceptional service. Dude, did you just try and give back $100 tip? It's not the money. It was who it was coming from. Why? Who is she? She's one of the hotel's investors. I ran into her with my mom earlier. I thought this place was entirely owned by the Mendozas. All I know is my mom told me to steer clear. Must be something shady about her. Yeah, come in. Oh. Thought you were the bellhop. I'm checking out. I'm glad I caught you. Can I... come in? It's your hotel, right? Um... I didn't know Danny was in a relationship when I met him. Yeah, I figured. I'm not mad at you. I just... wish he would've handled it differently. Yeah. Me, too. Well, before things got weird, I did enjoy getting to know you. I don't know. Maybe in another life, we would've been friends. So, pseudo-friend to pseudo-friend... Is there anything else about Danny that I should know? Any other skeletons hiding in his closet? What has he told you about his family? Just that he has a sister and he bounced around group homes. Well... the messed-up way that they grew up... Let's just say it takes a lot for him to trust people. - Oh. - So, yeah. He plays his cards pretty close to the vest. But I know for a fact that his intentions are good. As hard as it is for me to say it... um... I can tell he really loves you. Ingrid. What are you doing here? Uh, sorry, I was hoping to be done cleaning by the time you got back. - How are you? - How are you? Um... Look, Ingrid, I'm... I'm sorry about the baby. I-I guess it wasn't meant to be. How are you holding up? You know what they say... Progress, not perfection. But, um, this place does have a lot of triggers. Including me? I-I told Mrs. P I wouldn't take my job back - unless you were okay with it. - No, and I am. I... But this could get... awkward... you know? So maybe it's best you don't clean my room. O-Of course. I'll see you around. Uh... Let's try not to see each other. That's kind of the point. Got it. Ladies. - Excuse me. - Let's do it. Excuse me. Can I steal your friend Vanessa? Ooh. - Hey. - Hi. I just wanted to a-apologize for earlier. Um, I'm not in any calendar. My friend was just trying to help me out because I'm not great at talking to beautiful women. Well, you seem to be doing pretty well right now. Uh... Okay. Well, since we're being honest, I knew your buddy was full of it. Yes, he is. But it gave me an excuse to talk to you, so... Hmm. Can I buy you a drink? I'd like that. I know I went too far. But... he provoked me. Felix said you threatened to hand him over to some "dangerous people." Who? The thugs we owe money to? It was an empty threat. I w... I-I was just trying to scare him into telling me where the money is. Do those people know where he is now? The man I fell in love with would never hide things from me or do business with gangsters or attack someone... This is exactly what Felix wants! To drive a wedge between us! You are doing a very good job of that yourself. Hey. Hey. Look, I was thinking about how we left things. Me, too. Uh, I'm not gonna go. With my dad. Look, I-I realized I don't want to leave with him if that means I lose you. Wait. I need to tell you something. Okay. I have been acting weird about your dad, but it's not because I'm judging or even because I don't want to leave the country with you. If I leave... I can't come back. What do you mean? My family and I came here from Colombia when I was 4. And I guess we were in a hurry, - so we didn't get asylum. - Okay... I didn't find out until I was a teenager, but, um... I'm undocumented. Honey. It's okay. I promise. It's... It's just a really scary time to admit that out loud. Please don't tell anyone. No one knows outside my family. Well, I guess that makes me your family now. This is Theresa Williams. She's a local business owner... Very wealthy, very... influential, but there are rumors about her. What kind of rumors? The suspicion is she heads up the Biscayne Crime Syndicate. Are you telling me that Mateo is involved in organized crime? Not just Mateo. If the syndicate is invested in the hotel, then Santiago Mendoza may be in on it, too. Oh, my God. Sky left me a message before she went missing, saying she had found something at the hotel. Proof of this? She seemed really scared. Well, the syndicate is very dangerous, very powerful. They're known for extortion... arson, kidnapping. I mean these p... Kidnapping? Could they have taken Sky? To keep her quiet? It's possible. So my sister really might be alive. I need to be transferred off the 14th floor. Because of Javi? That's probably best for everybody involved. And, um, I need to be taken off the executive offices, as well. Because of Mateo? Is there anyone on the 7th floor that you need to avoid? Well, you can start there today. Thank you. Oh, and, Ingrid, can I give you a little advice, woman-to-woman? Sure. You need to start making better life choices. Hey, wait, wait. One more look. See? I told you they should've put you in that calendar. Damn, boy! I, uh... I don't know how long you're staying, but, uh... Hmm. Can I see you again? - Absolutely. - Mm. Mmm. Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh. Okay. Whoo. Oh, hey, Ingrid. Hey. ♪ I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight ♪ Gigi? - ♪ I can't be the only ♪ - Mi amor? We can go out this way. Girls. Mom texted us. Do you really have to leave right now? What happened to your face? Okay, never mind that. You have to say goodbye to your father quickly. But... I was still thinking of going with you. Caro, it's too risky. I know this time with your dad has been a blessing, - but it's over, girls. - Your mother's right. I'm gonna miss you both so much, okay? You'll stay in touch? Of course. You can't stop me. Sorry, we got to go. Love you. Love you. Love you. Is Mom going with him? I don't know. Organized crime? Here? I know. Now I feel like I have to warn Alicia. But if I tell her the truth, I'm gonna lose her. Well, think how you'd feel if something happened to her. Look, I've known Alicia my whole life. She's good people. She'll listen. God, what is she gonna think of me? When you first told me the truth, I believed you. It's gonna be a shock at first, but, you know, if she loves you the way that you love her, she'll hear you. She might even help you. I can't deliver Felix to you. Don't tell me you've had a crisis of conscience. He's not here anymore. Neither is Mrs. Mendoza. Well... that's very disappointing. It's out of my hands. Now that Felix is gone, there's no reason for you to be here. No, no, no, no, Santiago. I have to tell you, I have absolutely fallen in love with this hotel. What? And I would love to spend more time here. Maybe have an office. That's not a good idea. I'm sorry. That's not a request. I've realized that this hotel could be very useful to my business. Guess you're stuck with me. I should've been up-front about Heather from the beginning. I am sorry. There is no excuse, but I can promise you, no more secrets... starting now. - I... - Danny, I know it's hard for you to open up to people. I just want you to know it's okay. When you feel safe to share, you will. No. No. I, um... I came here to tell you something, and that's what I'm gonna do because I care about you. Do you remember Sky Garibaldi? The woman who went missing in the hurricane? She's my sister. And I never believed she just went missing, but the police wouldn't help me, so I decided to go undercover at the last place she was seen. Look, I know that sounds crazy, but I've discovered a lot of disturbing things. Mateo, he... he paid off the police to stop looking for her. And he works for some very, very bad people, who I think might be behind what happened to Sky. And I think your dad... I think your dad might be caught up in it, too. Alicia. Please say something. You're fired. Synchronized by srjanapala
