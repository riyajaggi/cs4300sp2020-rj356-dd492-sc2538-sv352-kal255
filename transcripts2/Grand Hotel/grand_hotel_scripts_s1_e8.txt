 - Previously on "Grand Hotel"... - It's my fault. His leg... what happened to him? It's my fault. She said a lot about how I remind her of Dad. You want to see him? I know where to find him. What do you know about Sky Garibaldi? Some of my friends, they found out that she's a hookup. Sky was... dealing drugs? Have your people deal with Finn. No one gets hurt. Was it always just about the money?

 No, Javi, I care about you. What's happening? Javi?! Javi! Javi, mijo! Look at me! Look at me! Call ahead to the E.R... Undetermined crush injury, possible fractures. Is he gonna be okay? That's what we're trying to find out. He... He lost it in an accident. When he was in high school. God. Por favor, Dios. No otra vez.

 Hang on, buddy! We're gonna get some help for you, okay? Can you move? Sir, sir. Sir, sit down! You're gonna be okay, son. I'm right here with you. Alicia?! Oh, thank God. I-I didn't know if you were at the Finn or you'd been... I'm okay. But Javi was in the collapse. I really need to get to the hospital. Hey, you're shaking. You're in no condition to drive. Do you want me to call Oliver? No, Oliver and I broke up. Um, I'm sorry. I can drive you. I don't want to bother you. Just... let me help you. Please. All your tests look normal. But you need to rest. Ingrid. Excuse me, sir. You can't be in here unless you're family. I'm... the baby's father. Oh. Well, they're both fine. I'll get your discharge papers. What are you doing here? I heard you were in the collapse. I was worried. I'm so sorry this happened. Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, see if Javi's okay. Okay. You have some nerve coming in here. I had no idea Javi would be there. No one was supposed to get hurt. You told me to "handle" the problem. The Finn is closed indefinitely. You got what you wanted. I never wanted this! It's gonna be a long night. So I figured you could use one of these. Thank you, honey. Um, we'll finish this later. I have to focus on my son. Of course. My prayers are with you both. Goodnight, Gigi. Mm. What was that? He just came to, um, check on Javi. So, why do you look like you want to kill him? Papi. Have you heard anything yet? No, mi vida. We're still waiting on the doctors. Javi's a fighter. He's gonna be okay, I know it. I know. I'm just so worried about him. Come on, we're gonna be late. Aren't you gonna eat? Leave me alone, brat. Hey, be nice. Eat. You got to get your strength for the big game. I'm not hungry. Lay off. It's open! I wonder who that could be. Good morning! I hope I'm not interrupting. Aunt Gigi! What are you doing here? Mm. I dropped the twins off at school early. And I thought I'd stop by and say good luck to Javi. Honey, please, get ready for school. So, it's the first game of the season, huh? You big, bad senior. What's going on? You're not excited to play? I don't know. It just doesn't feel right. Well, listen to me. Your mami loved watching you play. And I know she's not gonna be in the bleachers, but I promise you she's still watching you. Will you come? To the game? I thought you were never gonna ask. Come here. That's Mami's blessing. Well, I think I-I saw her say it, like, a million times before each game. Now go on. Get your things. Okay. Mm. I love you. I love you. He adores you. Mm. Santiago, you have to tell them about us. Mnh-mnh. It's too soon. They're still grieving. I know. The longer we wait... I know. I will. I promise I will. All right. So, what is this about some celebrity wanting a free room? She's kidding, sir. We're thrilled to have you. Can you give us a minute? Right on. Who the heck is he? Justin Journeys. He's a major social media "influencer." Influencer? Is that a job? He travels all over the world and posts about where he stays. And then his four million followers stay there, too. Four million people listen to that goober? Mm-hmm. Justin. Hi, I'd like to officially offer you the Oceanside Royal Suite. On the house. Right on! And you'll comp my EIRey tickets, too? Well, I'm sorry but EIRey is no longer performing here, or anywhere else for that matter. Hashtag that sucks. Hey, wait, can you just press "record" for me real quick? Oh, sure. 'Sup, peeps! It's me. I'm here at the Riviera Bland where EIRey don't play. Boo! Boo! Oh, boo, flamingo, boo! Justin! How about we not post that one? Okay, and what if I give you a free pass for a massage at our world-renowned spa? Sure. Uh, but the whole point of this trip was entertainment. I know, and I will find you something because I am hashtag on it. Hashtag dot com dot... org. Hey, man. Crazy night, huh? Did you know that Javi was in the balcony collapse? Yeah, I heard. I've been texting with Ingrid. Listen, I've been thinking about what those girls told you. About Sky. I can't believe she was dealing drugs. You know, you should talk to Topher. She could've been working with him. Topher? The Concierge? Yeah. If the guests want something... a little freaky... Call girls, pot, whatever... He's the "hook up" guy. That little dork? You want it, he gets it. No questions asked. All things considered, Javi is a very lucky man. He managed to escape with only a broken collarbone and a concussion. W-Will he need surgery? No, he'll need to wear a sling for a few weeks, but we can discharge him this evening. Can... Can we see him? Sure. Uh, but before you do, there is something you should know. When Javi arrived, he wasn't responding to the pain meds. Why not? We did a tox screen, and the opiates in his blood are through the roof. I don't understand. What... What are you saying? Your son is an addict. Are you sure we're at the right place? What a dump. Is that a hooker? Oh, my God, I have that same skirt. So that's a yes. Which room is it? Hi! Hi. Hey, Dad. Hey! Hey. How are you feeling? Ah, I'm okay. Oh, no, no, no, no hugs for a little bit, though. Right. You did have a balcony fall on you. Yeah. Uh-oh. What's with you? Oh, God. Please don't tell me I lost the other leg. Doctor thinks you have a problem with painkillers. Well, that's ridiculous. Then why was there so much in your blood? I don't know. It was Spring Break. Maybe I overdid it a little. It's not a big deal. So, this was, like, a one-time thing? Totally. I was just distracting myself. Ever since Ingrid told me about the baby, I haven't been able to get that out of my head. Okay. Well... everyone makes mistakes. Right, Dad? You're gonna need some clothes. Honey, why don't you go home and get your brother something to wear? Of course. You had this problem before. That was ten years ago. Okay, I lost my leg. Minute I realized I was hooked, I stopped. I want to believe you... But you don't. Why am I not surprised? Javi. Look at me. Javi. Mijo. Mijo, Javi. Earth to Javi. What?! I need to tell you something. There's a scout coming today. That's it? Nothing... Nothing else you want to tell me? I don't think so. Why? Wow. There he is. All right! Man of the hour! Ven ac√°. Hey, Javi. Javi, mijo. You can't just pretend there's not a problem. Can we just go home? Alicia. How's your brother? I've been asking around. He's gonna be fine. Thank God. Yeah, no thanks to you. Excuse me? You lied your way into to Javi's life. You sent him off the rails, and now he nearly died because of you. I'm so sorry. I... I feel awful. Yeah. Well, maybe you should. Two thousand dollars for some Bruno Mars tickets? You know, for that price, he better be singing while giving me a lap dance. Helen. Can I ask your honest opinion? Now, it's about Mateo. Mm. What about him? Why does Santiago keep him around? You know, they're always clashing. That's just how men are. They holler, they fight, and then they go get a beer. This is different. Mateo gets Ingrid pregnant, and Santiago still protects him. I-I wish I could help you, Gigi, but I am having a day. Malcolm is really struggling with his chemo. And now this Justin Journeys is wasting all my time. Justin who? Some Internet twerp. I gave him a free room, but now he's upset that EIRey is not performing. Oh. Please, Lord, let there be something sweet in here. I'm officially eating my feelings. You're eating your son's lunch? I gave him life, he could at least spare a cookie. That's my pleasure. Anything at all for my favorite guests in the whole hotel. Appreciate it. Topher. You got a second? Yeah, what's up? What do you need? Weed, molly, strippers, dippers? What the hell are dippers? Actually, I don't want to know. I, uh... I just need some info. These Spring Break girls were asking me about Sky Garibaldi. Did you know she was dealing drugs? Hundred bucks. What? Come on. I'm a businessman. That's all I got on me. Okay. Sky wasn't really a dealer. She was more like a "dabbler." Dabbler? Yeah. She would fake these injuries, and then she would sell the prescriptions for extra cash. Well, that seems like a risky way to make money. She was always borrowing money from somebody back home and had to pay him back. Her brother, I think? So you two weren't working together? Nah... I live for the hustle, but Sky hated it. She wanted out. She did? Yeah. One of her regulars was threatening her. He was saying he was gonna get her fired if she didn't bring him more pills. Get her fired? You didn't hear this from me. That's what you get when you deal to the boss' son. I am so glad both of you are here. I've been dying to see you ever since Victor put us in touch. Victor's a good friend. I don't have many left. Well, then, maybe you shouldn't have run off with all that money. Yoli, rude. No, it's okay. She doesn't know the whole story. Dad didn't steal that money. I took a lot of risks. The economy turned. The fund went belly-up. I could've fixed it if I just had a little more time. So then why did you run? A lot of very rich, powerful people lost a lot of money. They wanted to put me away for the rest of my life. You abandoned us. I'm sorry. Leaving you two girls was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. But I really didn't think I had a choice. Even Mom thinks you stole millions. Would I really be living in a roach hotel if I had millions of dollars? Dad. You okay? You know, some days I think I got this chemo thing down, but, man, this nausea is really getting me good. I actually got you something to help with that. You know Topher, the concierge? No, son, I'm not about to start smoking weed. No, no, no, no, no. There's no smoking required. I got you edibles. They're cookies in Mom's fridge. I don't think so. Come on. Topher said they're super strong, and they're gonna make you feel really good. Ding da ding ding! Ding! Great news. Whoa! What are you doing here?! Well, I heard Justin Journeys was looking for entertainment. Floor seats to the Miami Heat game. Sports? Mm-hmm. I wanted concert tickets. And also, I'm naked right now. Yes, you are. Get out! Get out! Go! Okay! So Sky was selling drugs to Javi? That's what Topher said. It doesn't mean Javi did anything to Sky. I mean, he's not violent, right? He took a swing at me, remember? This is a good lead. You're on the right track. No! This is the wrong track. I don't want to be on this track. What? Why not? Alicia broke up with Oliver. Oh. Yeah. So if her brother did something to my sister, how... How could we ever get past that and be together? You can't drop it now. You got to find out the truth, whether you like it or not. Look, I'm saying this as your family doctor. And your friend. Javi needs to go to rehab. Wait, is being away from his family really the best thing right now? I already confiscated his pills. He'll just find a way to get more. He needs to medically detox. Clearly, we didn't take his problem seriously enough the first time. The first time? What does she mean, the first time? When you brother lost his leg, he became addicted. It was so many years ago, I thought he was done. Why didn't you tell me? Maybe I could've done something to help him. You were just a child. You didn't need that burden. Dad, he doesn't even think he has a problem. He's never gonna agree to rehab. Well, I'll drag him by his hair if I have to, but he's going. Jason. Have you seen your mother? No, I was just grabbing something. Well, she's supposed to be handling this influencer. And he just posted that she walked in on him naked and during a massage. Oh, my God. I know. It doesn't sound like your mother. And now he's bashing us online, and people are canceling their reservations. Yeah, I, um... I had some cookies in here earlier. Oh, yeah. Your mother ate those. Um, she said you wouldn't mind. Yeah, we got to find her. Now. - Mrs. - Hey. Justin Journeys. You wanted a concert? Well, I got you a concert right here. Hit it. Hit it? Who are you talking to? Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you, Mrs. P, for testing the sound system. It sounds fantastic. Wait, but I didn't get to the key change! Karaoke coming to the Circle Bar soon, okay? Sorry. Sorry. Hey, uh, was somebody in my room? Yeah, I came to grab some of your clothes, and... I may have tidied up a little. What did you do? Your sister found your pills. Okay, guys, my shoulder's killing me. It's already bad enough the doctor wouldn't give me any real meds. No. No more pills. You're going to rehab. Oh, I get it. I get it. You don't want to deal with me, so you're gonna ship me off to be someone else's problem, right? No, of course not. It's not like that. You're sick. You need help. I thought you were on my side. Javi! Where are my damn pills at?! Javier! Javier! That's enough. There's a car waiting downstairs. We're going now. Like hell I am. Honey, please excuse us. What are you doing? You don't want to go to rehab? Then you and I will sit in this room until that junk gets out of your system. Oh, my God. Please put me back under the rubble. Is this funny to you? Yeah, it is kind of funny. You're acting crazy. I don't need your help! I can get myself clean! You think you can go without that stuff? Then prove it! And then I ended up going to community college for a year, which was like going to a convention of total uggos. And did you know community colleges don't even have sororities? That's a drag. What about you, Yo? What's new in your world? What's new? Like in the last decade? Oh, "lez" tell him about your love life. Come on. "Lez" do it. Lez. Subtle. I have a girlfriend now. I'm actually not surprised. Mm. You always had crushes on your female teachers in high school. So glad you're cool with it. Yeah. Maybe if you were around, coming out wouldn't have been total hell. I'm sorry. Hey, I'm trying here. You know, I... I admit I made mistakes, but if your sister can find a way to forgive me... She's different! When you left, she had Mom. But you were my person. I had no one. I felt like that every day I was away from you guys. FBI. Say whatever you have to. Just get rid of him. Get rid of him. Can I help you? Good evening. We're canvassing the area for a fugitive seen at a nearby convenience store. Have you seen this man? No. What about you, ma'am? Nope. I haven't seen him. Well, make sure you call if you do. Thanks for your time. I cannot believe that just happened. I can. They're never gonna stop looking for me. I'm sorry. I'll be out of here first thing in the morning. But we just got you back. How will we see you again? I don't know if you will. Unless you've got some place I can hole up in, I've got to disappear. How would you like upgrading to a nicer hotel? Yeah? I need your help with a guest. Justin Journeys. Mrs. P was on it, but she's not, um... herself today. Oh, that's too bad. Word is, she has a lovely singing voice. The point is, Mateo, we need to keep Justin happy. And I don't know how to do that without EIRey. Well, the World Music Awards are tonight. I'll get him the Mayor's box. Wow. Just like that? I'll pull some strings. It's what I do. No wonder Santiago thinks you're so invaluable. I just don't know why Mrs. P didn't bring me in on this sooner. Good question. Hey, Ingrid. What are you doing here? Uh, waiting for your mom. That may be a while. She's not really feeling well today. She's gonna be resting. Which is what you should be doing, too. Oh, no, I'm fine. Your mom left a message saying I could get my old job back. Wow, she must be really high. I mean, um, she must be worried about what happened at the Finn. Yeah, well, I'm not sure how the Mendozas will feel about me being here. They'll move on. It was an honest mistake. Yeah. It... wasn't a mistake. Well, come on. It's not like you meant to trick Javi. I knew he wasn't the father. We never even slept together. Wait, what? On the night of the hurricane, I found Javi passed out and drunk in a hallway. So, I helped him back to his room, and I rode out the rest of the storm there. And I thought this guy has everything, and he doesn't even appreciate it. So you just made up this huge lie? I was desperate. I kept hearing how many girls that he'd slept with and how he couldn't remember, and... I had no idea that he was a really good guy. What the hell is wrong with you? Danny. I didn't order room service. I know. May I? If you're like me... you forget to eat when you're worried. So, I asked the chef to whip up your favorites. This is incredibly thoughtful. How's Javi? Hey, hey. What's wrong? I thought he was out of the hospital. We found out Javi's been abusing prescription pain pills. And when he found out I took away his stash, he lashed out. At you? He's never been like that with me before. He was so angry. Did he... hurt you? No. It was just... shocking. I just feel like drugs make him a different person. How bad is Javi's drug problem? You tell me. I don't even know what to do with all these. Why don't you let me get rid of them for you? You shouldn't have to deal with this right now. Yeah, okay. Thank you. I forgot how easy it was to talk to you. Anytime. You feeling okay? Yeah, it's just cold in here. But you're sweating. Dad, are you trying to annoy me into going to rehab? Please. Make your move. No, this is... this is boring. Why don't you, uh... Why don't you order up some food? I'm starving. Really? You're not nauseous? No, I feel good. All right, I'll call down to the kitchen. No, no. No, Javi. Get out of my way. Get out of my way! No! No!! Hey. You can yell all you want. You are not walking through this door. Oh, my God. You're drunk. Bingo. You can't do this to me, Javier. I've been worried about you. Why don't you call Gigi? I'm sure she would've been happy to console you. What's that supposed to mean? I saw you two this morning. I never intended for you to... I'm so sorry. Oh, you're sorry? Sorry that... Sorry that you're screwing. Mom's best friend or sorry that you got caught? I don't expect you to understand, but Gigi's been there for me, for all of us. She wants your money. She's a gold digger, Dad. She wants your money, and you're just too whipped to see that. Cuidado, Javier. Tell me, tell me, tell me. Did you guys even wait for Mom's funeral? Or have you just been boning this whole time?! That's enough! Basta! We... We... We can't keep doing this, Javier. You're fighting me all the time. You're drinking! I know you're sad about Mami. Sad? Yes, I am sad, too, but you're throwing your life away! No, I'm not sad! I'm pissed! It should've been you. You do not talk to me like that if you want to keep living under my roof! Well, I don't! You're a joke, and I hate you! Okay, then go! Then go! Get out!! Just get out of here! Come on! Go! Jav... Javier? Damn, I am hungry! Can we order some nachos up in here? I didn't know Mrs. P stood for Mrs. Pot-Head. Yeah. How is she doing? She's still coming down from outer space. I should really go get my dad, but I'm worried about leaving Snoop Dogg over here alone. I can watch her. Thanks for letting me crash, Geej. This penthouse is beautiful. And so are you. And you may not be the nicest lady, but, girl, you can get it. Okay! Okay, Mom. Don't listen to anything she says. She's a bit of a blabbermouth right now. That's good to know. So, Helen, I have good news. Mm. Justin Journeys is giving us glowing reviews now. Mateo took care of it. Mateo? Yeah. Santiago finally told me all about Mateo. He did? Mm-hmm. Girl. I cannot believe Santiago borrowed all that money from those dangerous people. I know. Um, uh, Mateo was in on it? Of course he was. That's why Santiago had to hire him. He was part of the deal. Thank God we can finally talk about this, 'cause, girl, I thought I was about to burst. I see. What else did he tell you? You can be done with all this. We can leave right now. How about I call the cops, tell them you're holding me like a prisoner here? Go ahead. They can come arrest me, but at least you'll be alive. Why do you even care? Huh? You don't think I know how ashamed of me you are? "Put on some pants, son. People can see you." You don't understand. What happened to you was my fault. What? The night of your accident. I knew you were drunk. But I threw you those keys. I barely remember that night. I do. It was the darkest night of my life. Javier! That's my son! That's my son! Javi! Javier! You're gonna be okay, Javi. I didn't know that. About the keys. Everything would've been different. Your leg. Your life. Us. I'm not ashamed of you. I'm ashamed of myself. Ingrid? Uh, don't worry. I was just leaving. No, before you go, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for the way I treated you at the hospital. It-It's fine. You were right. No, actually, it turns out Javi's issues go back farther than I thought. For what it's worth, I wish I could go back in time and undo it all. I really do care about him. I know. So do I. Ingrid! Ingrid. What is it? It's... Something's wrong with the baby. Aah! Hey. You okay? Javi had these in his room. Prescribed to Sky. And Alicia said he's a different person when he's on drugs. You think he did something to your sister? Maybe. If he was high during the hurricane? And he came after to her? Wait, wait, no. No, he couldn't have. What? Javi was passed out during the hurricane. Ingrid found him. She was with him the whole night. Are you sure? Yeah. Oh, my God. I could kiss you. That's gonna be a hard pass from me. This is a relief! Okay, I-it means that Alicia and I can finally be... Well, unless somebody else in her family becomes a suspect. No, no, no. S-Stop, please. I... I almost lost Alicia once, I am not gonna lose her again. You're still here? Of course. Are you...? Is the baby...? I think it must've been the stress from the balcony collapse. I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. I thought you'd be relieved. You don't deserve this. If I could make it right... believe me, I-I would. Dad? You slept there all night in that chair? I don't know how much I actually slept. No wonder you look like crap. That's the Javi I know. Dad. I don't blame you for what happened to my leg. I was the one that drove drunk. You were just a kid. It was my responsibility to keep you safe. I'll go. To rehab. I'll try it. What if I can't do it? Once step at a time. Good. That's right. One step at a time. Great. Aah! It's okay, it's okay. Dad, I ca... I can't. I can't. Yes, you... Yes, you can. I can't. Come on. Hey, Javi. Of course you can. I believe in you. Okay. Okay? Okay. All right. All right. Come on, you're doing great. Come on. Easy. That's it. That's it. That's it, mijo. Well done. That's it. That's it. Yes, you can. You can do anything, mijo. You are stronger than you think. How come you never perform like that for me? I am going to kill Jason. How could he bring those demon cookies in here? Well, he was only trying to help me. And be real. When's the last time you laughed like that? Not since, um... you know. You been worrying about me? Every second of every day. Well, maybe you needed those cookies more than I do. Come here. Love you. Santiago. We need to talk. Are you okay? I'm exhausted. I just dropped off Javi. The rehab center seemed... nice. Of course he started looking for girls right away. I'm glad he's getting help. I just hope things will be better now. We were finally honest with each other. Good. Honesty is important. I'm sorry, mi amor. You wanted to talk? It can wait. Where are the rest of your things? This is it, everything I own. Well, on the bright side, it makes packing easy. You two sure about this? I don't want to get you into any trouble. Well, you need a place to stay. And you're our dad, so... We're sure. All right. Just to be safe, why don't you guys load this stuff in the back of the car and text me when the coast is clear? Cool. Yeah? Sounds good. Bill. Thanks for your help, man. You even had me convinced for a second there. "FBI!" Mind if I keep the suit? Nah, go ahead. Consider it a tip. All right. Who's ready for a little family road trip? Me! You should probably lay down in the back seat so no one sees you. You're right. You girls are so smart. Hey, sorry to drop by unannounced, I-I wanted to return this. And also... I wanted to see you. Um, thanks. How's your brother doing? He's going to rehab, so that's great. What a relief. And if you ever want to talk more about it, you know, I'm... I'm always here for you. Yes, I know. That's the problem. O-kay? Why are you being so nice to me? It's driving me crazy. Being nice is a bad thing? Yes! I just... I feel like there's something between us, but then you've made it completely clear that you don't want to be with me. And now you're here, and you're kind and sweet and romantic! And you're the only person I ever want to talk to. And I-I just... I can't do it anymore. I'm an idiot, Alicia. I've been falling for you since the moment I first laid eyes on you. But you told me your life was complicated. It is. But I don't care anymore.
