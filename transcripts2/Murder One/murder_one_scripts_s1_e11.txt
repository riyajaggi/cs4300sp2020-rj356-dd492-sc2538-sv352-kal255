 The prosecution and defense face off during jury selection. Do you understand the concept of reasonable doubt? You understand the concept of circumstantial evidence, don't you? That if such doubts aren't reasonable, then you must return a verdict of guilty. The law requires that when there are two reasonable inferences... ...to be drawn, you must adopt the one suggesting innocence. Neil Avedon's obsessed fan. --Neil is the one who should be asking the questions! ls Holly Gerges capable of doing what she says she did here? Absolutely. "Tell your girlfriend to keep away from you... ...or I'll do what I did to Jessica."

 Her hands fit around Jessica Costello's throat as easily as anyone else's. I could show you 100 different ways where we are 100 percent... ...predestined to be together. What exactly would you like me to do? Wait for me outside, because I'm going to kill your attorney. -I don't want you to do that, Holly. -I could make you happy. Give me the gun. Holly Gerges died in custody. No sign of struggle. What are the actuarials of a woman in her 30s dropping dead on cue? If it was a hit, it was sophisticated. Ted Hoffman confronts the enemy. I know what you did, Richard, even if I'll never be able to prove it. I know you were involved in this girl's murder... ...and Dave Blalock's and Jessica Costello's.

 I see through the alibis, the veils of lies and deception... ...to the sickness at the core of your being. The People v. Mr. Neil Avedon. Good morning. Miriam Grasso and Mark Washington for the people. Theodore Hoffman and Chris Docknovich for Mr. Avedon. -Defense has a motion? Yes. The defense moves this court to dismiss the charges against Mr. Avedon. The people oppose. lncluded in our points and authorities... ...is an authenticated letter of one Holly Gerges. ...is an authenticated letter of one Holly Gerges. lt presents evidence that she confessed... ...to committing Jessica Costello's murder. Not my client. -What about it, Ms. Grasso? -We contend the late Holly Gerges... ...would've confessed to killing Marilyn Monroe... ...if she thought it would favorably influence the defendant. We therefore are requesting a postponement... ...to develop information to support our position. And to prepare opposing papers. That's a stalling tactic which is not only unfair to Mr. Avedon... ...but a waste of the court's time and the taxpayers' money. Notwithstanding counsel's civic concern... ...the people's request for more time is reasonable. We're approaching the holiday season, vacations have us short-staffed. We could take this up after the first of the year. Meanwhile, Mr. Avedon has a murder charge... ...hanging over his head that doesn't belong there. I'm not gonna derail this whole process, Mr. Hoffman. I'm setting the hearing after Christmas recess two weeks from today. Jury selection will continue as scheduled... ... resuming tomorrow morning at 1 O a.m. What's she waiting for? Why doesn't she drop the charges against me? She has to give the DA a chance to investigate the letter and Holly Gerges. Oh, man. Two more weeks. And even then, Neil, it's a long shot. Like a lottery ticket. Put it away and forget about it until the drawing. Okay, Ted, sure. I will. Please continue, Mr. Hoffman. Your questionnaire states you saw on LAW TV... ...that my client passed a polygraph. I think it was LAW TV. Do you understand... ...that polygraph results cannot be used in a court of law? ...that polygraph results cannot be used in a court of law? -Yes. Notwithstanding that fact... ...have you already made up your mind? If he can kill, he can lie about it. Lie detectors are scientific. You can't fool science. I think he was telling the truth. He's an actor, right? He lies for a living. The fact that he agreed to take the test tells me he might be innocent. And because this is a high-profile case, with a well-known defendant... ...l have to ask why you want to be on this jury. I'm retired, and I'd like to do something constructive with my time. I'm just here because I got that thing in the mail. This case is so famous, I feel like I'm a part of history. Does this mean I have to leave? I can be fair. lt says on your questionnaire that you think Neil Avedon's attorney is mean. -You are. Do I have moments... -...or am I mean all the time? I saw you on TV, at the-- -...or am I mean all the time? I saw you on TV, at the-- What do you call it? Preliminary hearing. You weren't very nice. You were pushy. If I were representing your brother... ...who was charged with a murder you knew he didn't commit... ...and the prosecutor wanted to put him away for life... ...would you want me to be nice? -That would be different. How so? lt'd be my brother. And you'd want me to be as tough and aggressive... ...as humanly possible for your innocent brother, wouldn't you? -I suppose. You suppose. Well, I'm not sure. Maybe. So in other words, for the right person, an innocent person... ...my bad manners are permissible? Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you might like me better already. I have three young daughters, myself. The guy just doesn't set well with me. Could you be more specific about your discomfort, sir? Well, maybe he didn't kill the Costello girl, but he sure took advantage of her. -Nothing further. -Mr. Hoffman? You have no idea how old or mature Jessica Costello looked, do you, sir? The paper runs her picture all the time. That's her high school class photo. But you don't know what she looked like when she was with Avedon, do you? No, I guess I don't. Have you read newspaper reports that say Jessica was a regular patron... ...at clubs that only admit adults 21 and older? -Yes. So can you accept the fact... ...that Neil Avedon may have believed that Jessica was older than her years? lt wouldn't be the first time it happened. Yeah. Nothing further. Mr. Switzer, if you remain a juror, and you're presented with facts... ...that Jessica Costello not only acted older than her years... ...but also had a dozen sexual partners, would you be inclined to blame her... -...for her own death? -No. And if you were presented with facts that she had... ...in excess of 20 sexual partners... ...from whom she may have accepted gifts or money or cocaine... ...from whom she may have accepted gifts or money or cocaine... ...would that dispose you to blame Jessica Costello for her own death? No, I don't think so. I sense some ambivalence. Twenty guys is a lot. Yes, it is. Is it too many for you to be fair? I don't know. At a certain point, you gotta wonder. The court thanks and excuses Mr. Switzer for cause. -You're a professor of constitutional law? That is correct. If you were a part of this jury, do you think your expertise... ...would have an impact on the jury during deliberations? I wouldn't allow that to happen, counsel. I'm a purist who believes that there are no experts on juries. Just 12 dedicated citizens. You haven't formed any opinion about this case? Not yet. Until evidence and testimony are presented to me... ...how could I possibly have an opinion? I believe everyone has good in them. Everybody loses their way. Does that belief extend to my client? I don't know. l've seen you on TV saying he had nothing to do with that girl's death. But he was there the night she died. He had some part in it. But you don't know he had some part in it... ...because you haven't heard any evidence. Is that correct? That's right. -The law states that you must... ...presume Mr. Avedon didn't kill Jessica Costello... ...unless the prosecution proves differently. -You understand that, don't you? -Yes, I got that. Can you follow the law and presume Mr. Avedon's innocence? I have to. -Sidebar, judge. -Approach. The defense challenges Mrs. Harris for cause. She said she'd make the presumption of innocence. Of course, we're in a public forum. The truth is she couldn't presume innocence even if she tried. I don't see it. If you want her off, you'll have to exercise a peremptory. I reserve the right to come back to her. Only if something new comes up. I want this jury seated by Christmas recess. Step back. We are in recess until 3:OO. I bet you spent $200 on that shirt. Eighty-five. Half-price sale at Fred Segal. Wait and see what I get with my Christmas bonus. -Think we'll get our bonuses today? We'd better. I started shopping for a car Iast weekend. If history prevails, today's the day. Ted will pass them out in the staff meeting, first thing. -Good afternoon, folks. Afternoon. First things first. We're stacked up on Avedon. Let's make sure everything else is covered. I have all the appeals and motions under control. I'm handling your court appearances and getting continuances where necessary. Excuse me, Ted. Richard Cross is here. He'd like a moment. Shall I put him in your office? He can wait in the lobby. I'm fielding client calls. Gary Blondo said Neil's movie opened to record numbers. Great. Neil could use good news. -What did Blondo really want? -For Neil to do publicity on Deadbolt. -The answer is no. Got it. Studio won't be too pleased. We just sent them last month's Iegal services bill. Money well spent to protect their investment and his movie. What else? Leonard Meech wants our representation before the state bar. -What's the charge? -He cut himself in for 300/o... ...of an estate he was representing. He also commingled the funds with his business account before the lady died. Pass. That's Meech's M.O. We don't need any more bad press right now. If that's all, we're done. Oh. Almost forgot. Christmas bonuses. -Merry Christmas. -Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Thank you. -Thank you, Ted. -Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Ted. What can I do for you, Richard? I have an associate, a very influential man from Brazil. His son has had some... ...difficulty here in Los Angeles. ...difficulty here in Los Angeles. I hope that your hard feelings toward me... ...would not prevent you from helping someone in need. So before I talk to him about you... ...l needed to see if you would indeed take a referral from me. -What is it? -The boy's a student at USC. A co-ed has made an accusation of date rape. The kid's young, he's confused, he's... ...avoiding the issue. Meaning he's a fugitive from justice. His father arrives today. May I send him to you? -Does he have a name? -Roberto Portalegre. Have him call me. I appreciate this, Teddy. Very festive. I like it. Teddy. Sneaking in the back way again? -Louis' gifts. You forgot them. -Oh, thanks. What did we get for him this year? A nice collection of stocking stuffers from Barneys... -...and a cruise to Mexico. -lf I can get him to take time off. Since you brought it up... ...l realize Christmas recess is your time to prepare for the trial. I know, I've been thinking about it too. We're gonna carve out some real time for the three of us... ...starting with Christmas Eve. No trial, no Neil Avedon... ...just you, me and Lizzie. I'd better go before Louis gets back and realizes there's no Santa Claus. Did I ever tell you how crazy I am about you? Thank you, Santa. I know we disagree on this, Ted. But I like what I'm seeing with Professor Adler. -He could become your virtual juror. Who's that? Your virtual juror is the person who, in effect... ...is Ted's stand-in with the jury during deliberations. I also like this Iverson lady. Problem is, they read neutral on paper. Let's see how they do in the room. Ted, Mr. Portalegre's here for his 2:OO. I deposited him in your office. All right. -When are we due back in court? -About an hour. I'll grab you then. I've got phone calls. Meet you downstairs. You okay? I'll be better when Bornstein dismisses the case. Don't get too high and you won't get too low. Does this allegation come out of a relationship or stem from a first date? Mr. Hoffman, Eduardo's 20 years old. And you must understand, this charge... ...this preposterous thing, could never happen to him at home. A girl wouldn't allow herself to be alone with a man... ...at 3:OO in the morning, drunk, unless she wanted sex. To think, Eduardo's being hunted. I hope you can help us. -Where is your son now? -Somewhere safe. He'll have to turn himself in. I don't want him in jail. I understand, but this is a serious charge. If he'll agree to turn himself in, this firm will take the case. Then we'll try to work out a deal for surrender with quick bail. And then he'll be released? At least temporarily. I make no promises. Understood. Please let me know when I should bring Eduardo to you. I will. Pleasure meeting you. The pleasure is mine, Mr. Hoffman. Richard wasn't wrong about you. -What's this? -Fifty thousand dollars. Do your best for Eduardo. I'll send you a bill, Mr. Portalegre. -I'd appreciate it if you paid by check. -Of course. -Chris is in the lobby. Anything? -I need Lisa right away. And open a file on Mr. Portalegre. Have you heard reports that my client and Jessica... ...engaged in consensual sex, maybe even on the very night Jessica died? Yes. How do you feel about that, Ms. Iverson? I don't feel anything about it, one way or the other. Does the fact that Neil is 25 years old and Jessica was only 15... ...cause you to look at Mr. Avedon in a negative light? Well, that is quite an age disparity. Can you be impartial in light of that? I think so, yes. Professor Adler... ...does Neil Avedon remind you of any of your students? No one in particular. Not even that rare breed to whom things seem to come too easily? No. Not at all. -Thank you. Ms. Grasso? I'd like to return to your comments on evidence. -What if a blood sample.... I tell you, he's a keeper. -He means what he says. -I don't think he has a problem with me. But he's got a problem. Maybe it's me or Miriam or the judge. Something's wrong. The one that worries me is Iverson. She looks right through me. I'll take another run at her. And at Adler. We're not near getting dismissed for cause on either. -We're down to three peremptories. Excuse me. ls this proceeding interrupting you people? Apologies, Your Honor. If I could clear up a few things, Ms. Iverson. You say you work in the family printing business. -ls this your husband's company? -My father's. -l've never been married. I see. Any other siblings? I have four brothers. -Do they work in the firm? No. -Did they ever? -No. You live in the house you were born in? I inherited it from my parents. Do you live alone? -I'm a single woman. Yes. Do you live alone? -I'm a single woman. Yes. -Thank you. May we have a sidebar? Approach. I'll tell you right now, I don't see a dismissal for cause. She can't possibly render a fair verdict. Neil Avedon represents every man who left her behind. He's trying to save his peremptories. Iverson's biased against my client. Maybe. I can't be sure of that unless you interview her further. If I ask her any more personal questions, and she doesn't reveal her bias... ...she'll never forgive me or my client. -Do you want to exercise a peremptory? -Not at the present time. -Yeah? Lisa, Deputy Dr Bronson... -...returning your call. -Thanks, Lila. David, thank you for getting back to me. I'm representing Eduardo Portalegre. You have a wanted out on him for rape. I'd like to get together as soon as possible and nip this in the bud. We don't have to hook and jab about this over the phone. Why don't you get out your calendar and we'll set up a time. Do you have any openings this afternoon? So is this your specialty now? Boy studs who won't take no for an answer? How do you know she said no? Because she told you? Come on. She presents no visible injuries, no trauma, you said so yourself. Well, if it's not a rape, then why is your guy on the run? He's a stranger in a strange land. This is a wobbler, David. Let's just resolve it and save everybody grief. Put something on the table. Let him self-surrender on a book and release. You and I agree, in advance, on $5000 bail. He's already on the run. Twenty grand. He's coming in, remember? Let's make it 10... ...he pleads to misdemeanor assault with a fine, and we call it a day. And the victim gets to live with this for the rest of her life? Uh-uh. No deal. Offer up some time. -Offer up a case. -Oh, I will. I promise. All right. How about this. Give me the book and release, and he posts $10,OOO bail. That way he surrenders and you file any way you want. Deal. Can't wait to meet him. My money says there's gonna be a new suspect... ...which will free Avedon up... ...and I bet Richard Cross has something to do with it. Have you followed the court's admonition since jury selection... ...not to watch or read anything about the Costello case? Yes, I have, Your Honor. Why? The court needed clarification. -Please proceed. -Well, like I said... ...Cross will have something to do with Avedon getting out. And you base this theory on what? Cross put up his bail, didn't he? Follow the money. What's forbes say Cross is worth? Four hundred million? All in multinational corporations. Now look at Avedon's new movie. Could it be any clearer? I'm afraid, sir, it could. Avedon's new movie was partly financed by a Dutch company... ...shot in Canada, to be distributed by a French corporation. Follow the money. -Mm-hm. -Multinationals. Eurodollars. The erasure of economic boundaries. Cross and Avedon are Freemasons. You're referring to the fraternal organization? I am referring, ma'am, to the secret organization... ...whose goal is a one-bank, one-government world. Cross and Avedon are active members. That's why Avedon slips out. Because they don't have time for your little trial. Oh. Now I get it. Your Honor? The court appreciates your insights, sir. Thank you, you're excused. Oh, I'm dismissed, is that it? That's it. The bailiff will see you out. Fine. The conspiracy continues. Are you sure this deputy district attorney can be trusted? Absolutely. Eduardo will be booked, printed and bailed out tonight. Will you be there to make sure everything goes as planned? Ms. Gillespie is more than capable. You can place your full faith and confidence in her. Do I have your assurance that my son won't go to prison? Nobody could give you that, Mr. Portalegre. Eduardo is facing very serious charges. Then why should I chance Iosing my son? Because otherwise he'll remain a fugitive, and when they catch him... ...he'll face felony charges for fleeing, and prison will be a near certainty. You should also know the United States has an extradition treaty with Brazil. Eduardo. I can't thank you enough for your help. -This has been a difficult experience. -You're welcome. -I'll see you tonight. -Adios. -I'll see you tonight. -Adios. Mr. Hoffman. Ms. Gillespie. Do you have any questions? No. I just wanna get this over with. Follow Ms. Gillespie's instructions, and we'll speak tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Hoffman. It's all right to feel a little nervous. It's completely normal. Do you have a boyfriend? -Excuse me? -I see. You don't want to talk about it. -ls it because of your attraction to me? -My what? I assure you, it's mutual. I hope you're not stupid enough... ...to talk like this in front of the deputy DA. Just a second. -Hey! Don't you ever-- -You were under the mistletoe. Excuse me. What the hell do you think you're doing? You must be the boyfriend. What's going on? Nothing. It's a misunderstanding. -You sure? -Everything's fine. We'd better get downtown. You've had a run-in with the police, haven't you? Yeah, last year. What happened? Well, me and my friends were Iooking for a club in Hollywood. And the police pulled us over. -Why'd they do that? They said... ...we fit the description of somebody who held up a 7-Eleven. How did that make you feel? It was no big deal. They did whatever they had to do on their radios, and they let us go. Does that experience lead you to believe that the police... ...mistakenly arrested Neil Avedon? Not necessarily. Despite being detained for a crime you didn't commit? They stopped us because we were black. That doesn't have anything to do with this case. -Your Honor, sidebar? -Approach. Challenge for cause. The people's case is based in part on police investigation. The juror has an antipathy for the police. She just said otherwise. I agree. You want her out, Ms. Grasso, exercise a peremptory. We'll keep her at this time. Thank you, Your Honor. What's happening? Your Honor, one more piece of business. At this time, the people are prepared to go forward... ...with the motion to dismiss the case. I assume you have something new to present to the court? Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. The defense has had no opportunity to review... ...whatever it is they're putting forth. We would ask you to retain the original date for resumption. We're all here now. Let's see what they have... ...and we'll take it from there. Ladies and gentlemen, the court has some unfinished business. If you will follow the bailiffs, we'll see you tomorrow at 9 a.m. What's going on? We're resuming the hearing to dismiss. Two weeks early, which means they have something. Ms. Gerges' priors led me to think she may have been stalking the defendant... ...in the days preceding Ms. Costello's murder. I worked back along the defendant's personal appearances... -...to establish his whereabouts. -What did you find? The defendant was on the David Letterman show three days... ...before the murder. I requisitioned Ms. Gerges' credit card receipts... ...and found several charges that placed her in Manhattan during that taping... ...and subsequently, up to and including the day of the murder. Would it refresh your recollection as to specifics if you could refer to your notes? Yes, it would. -Please do so. Ms. Gerges charged a meal at Planet Hollywood in New York at 6:18... ...September 20th, the night of the murder... ...and then attended the 8:OO showing oq Cats... ...and returned to her hotel, where she made a long-distance call to Florida... ...from her hotel room at two minutes after midnight. Did you take steps to ensure that these charges were made by Ms. Gerges... ...and not someone else using her card? I flew to New York with a photo of Ms. Gerges. I interviewed the waiters at the restaurant... ...an usher at the theater, and the doorman at her hotel. -They all positively identified Ms. Gerges. -Objection. Hearsay. These are statements from percipient witnesses who we can fly out here... ...if the court sees fit. Detective Polson is relating their statements... -...that they could identify Ms. Gerges. -I'll allow them. So your investigation demonstrates, categorically, that Ms. Gerges... ...could not have been in Los Angeles to commit Jessica Costello's murder. -ls that correct, detective? -That's correct. Thank you. No further questions. Exhibits and affidavits... ...supporting Detective Polson's testimony. ...supporting Detective Polson's testimony. Any cross-examination? We need time to review these documents, Your Honor. All right, so does the court. Detective Polson, you're excused. I'll rule on this tomorrow morning. I'm screwed. Totally, completely screwed. -Take it easy, Neil. -Teddy... ...tell me this is gonna be dismissed after what just happened in there. You're right. We can expect her to deny our motion. -Oh, man. -It's just one battle in a long campaign. -Yeah, right. -You okay? Oh, I'm terrific. Why don't you and me hang out tonight? No, it's all right. I'll be fine. Ted? Ted, do you have a minute? Can I talk to you about something? Neither Mrs. Harris nor Ms. Iverson... ...have ever been involved in a civil or criminal action. Same for the professor, however, when I ran a Westlaw search... ...for any cases he might have litigated, things started popping. Be advised, the Westlaw fee for this month will be higher than usual. Attorney of record, Simon Adler. He was an associate at Sax Ballantine. Which shows up nowhere in his faculty bio. Exactly. I called a guy I know over there. I clerked with his sister for Judge Connally. When Adler was an associate, he drew second chair... ...on all the big product-liability cases. Humongous clients. He gets his shot at one of his own. Beasley v. Southern Dynamics. His ticket to partner. -But he blew it. -Bigtime. He cost Southern Dynamics a treble damage award... ...when it should have been a slam dunk. -Did Southern think that? -Apparently. They left the firm, took $8 mil a year with them. He was forced to resign, couldn't get arrested at any firm. The litigators at Sax still refer to screwups as "laying an Adler." So he packed his bags and checked into academia. -Good work. -Glad to be of help. -I'll just leave that for you. -Thanks. Ted, line three. It's about Neil Avedon. This is Ted Hoffman. Where? Thanks for the call. -Louis buzzed me. That was Neil's girlfriend. His phone's been off the hook for over an hour. We'd better get out there. Neil? Neil? Teddy. Teddy, over here. Neil! You okay? Come on, Neil, let's get you over. There we go. Come on. -Let's lift you up. I can't go anywhere. Hi, Chris. -Teddy. -Easy now. Oh, man, I messed up. It's okay. I messed up, man. -I'll stay with him. -You sure? Yeah. He'll be in court tomorrow. I don't believe it. Call me if he needs anything. -Yeah. -What'd I do, what'd I do? Neil, can we get a photo? -You have every right to be mad at me. -ln here. Neil, can you make one quick comment? Mr. Avedon? Neil! I left here last night, intending on going straight home. All I did was stop at the Canyon Market to get something to eat. The guy in the deli won't even look at me. There's an older woman staring at me like I'm dirt. I'm in line... ...and there are two girls my age. They see me, they put down their stuff... ...and they walk out. I figured, "Screw it." Went and got a bottle of Scotch, took it back to my place... ...you know the rest. I know it's a broken record... ...but I'm sorry. You're sober now, and that's what counts. One day at a time. Let's go. l've reviewed the prosecution's exhibits and affidavits on the defense's motion... ...to dismiss this action. I find them wholly authentic and dispositive. Therefore, I'm denying the defense's motion... ...and excluding the Gerges Ietter from evidence. Bailiff, bring the jury in. Take a deep breath. We're no worse off than we were before. Do I understand you correctly? You think that by living a promiscuous life... ...Jessica Costello was partially responsible for her own death? Yes, I do. But that doesn't mean I blame her. Could you explain the distinction? I'm angry at my own daughter for living with her boyfriend. That doesn't mean I think she deserves any trouble that might come her way. The People have no challenge for cause to Mrs. Harris. Mr. Hoffman? Mrs. Harris, forgive me for being personal. But is your daughter's boyfriend older than she is? They're the same age, 18. -ls he an actor? -He's a mechanic. -Do they do drugs together? -I would hope not. As would any parent. Thank you. A moment, judge. -She gave me all the right answers. -I think she has an unconscious agenda. -Convicting Neil teaches her kid a lesson. -I'm getting the same vibe. Lose her. Your Honor, the defense exercises its peremptory as to Mrs. Harris... ...and thanks and excuses her. The defense realizes it has no other peremptories? We do. You're excused, ma'am. Thank you for your time. Ms. Iverson, you write in your questionnaire that you've heard... ...accounts of Mr. Avedon's relationship to his family. ln passing, yes. Most of those accounts paint my client... ...as an irresponsible playboy who abandoned his family, don't they? Generally, yes. Would it surprise you that Mr. Avedon has financially supported his family... ...since he was 15 years old? Objection, Your Honor. Counsel's giving character testimony. I'm trying to determine what she has read or heard about Mr. Avedon. I'll allow it. The juror may respond. I wasn't aware he supports his family, no. If we present facts that show a different picture of Mr. Avedon... ...than in the media... ...would you change your impression of him? I don't know. Are you at least open to the possibility? I'm open to anything. The defense presents no challenge to Ms. Iverson. I did write on my questionnaire that I'm fond of detective novels... ...but that's like working crossword puzzles for me. Rest assured that I would confine myself in my deliberations... -...to the evidence presented in the case. -Thank you, professor. The prosecution has no challenge to Professor Adler. Mr. Hoffman? Before you were a legal scholar, you were a litigator, is that right? That was a long time ago. Did you enjoy trial work? -Not particularly, no. -Any special reason? I simply prefer academia. Was there any one case that stands out in your recollection... ...as having had a particularly negative impact on your career as a litigator? Objection. Beyond the scope of voir dire. If the court will indulge me, I need to know... ...if the professor harbors any prejudice towards the system... ...or toward trial lawyers in particular. I'll allow it, but get to it, Mr. Hoffman. You were lead counsel in a case by the name of Beasley v. Southern Dynamics... -...were you not? -I was an associate at the time. -But you tried the case. Yes. -How did you do? -Not very well. You left the firm very soon after that case. That's not why I left. But your leaving wasn't entirely voluntary, was it, professor? -Objection. Withdrawn. -Do you ever miss it? -Never. It doesn't bother you to be so learned... ...in jurisprudence, and at the same time, to be outside of it? I don't consider myself to be outside. Outside the fray, is what I meant. What you meant? I know what you mean. No, I don't deal with the life-and-death matters anymore. I'm not asked to go on TV... ...and talk about the pressing legal issues of the day the way you are. Am I suffering because of that? No. You're good at what you do. And I'm good at what I do. -You are, indeed. I would rather be where I am... -You are, indeed. I would rather be where I am... ...and who I am, than strutting around a courtroom... ...in your $2000 suit, twisting and obfuscating and distorting... ...facts and logic and common sense, all to protect a client... ...who, more likely than not, is also filthy rich and guilty as sin. It's a game to you, counselor. lt is not a game to me. Your Honor, the defense challenges Professor Adler for cause. Granted. The court excuses you, sir, and thanks you for your time. Do you, and each of you, understand and agree... ...that you will accurately and truly try this case now pending before this court... ...and a true verdict render according only... ...to the evidence presented to you and the instructions of the court? I do. I remind you not to read or watch anything about this case... ...or to discuss it with each other or anyone else. Enjoy the holiday. The court expects you back here at 9 a.m. on January 4th... ...for the commencement of trial. We are adjourned. -Merry Christmas and happy New Year. -Same to you, Teddy. I have a feeling the new year is going to be a very interesting one, don't you? Eduardo Portalegre? The DA just called. The charges have been dropped. Nice work. The girl recanted. I had nothing to do with it. -Roberto Portalegre is here. -Show him in. Mr. Hoffman. Ms. Gillespie. I couldn't leave town without thanking you for helping my son. Your firm is every bit as effective as Richard Cross promised. Actually, the girl is the one you should thank. She suddenly and inexplicably refused to cooperate with the prosecution. Without her, they have no case. You saw to it justice was served. May l continue to call upon you for counsel? -Of course. Excellent. I can find my own way out. Ms. Gillespie. If he was gonna pay that girl off all along, what did he need us for? Good question. -Go home, Lisa. -Okay. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Oh, and... ...thanks again for the bonus. Lisa? For you. Please accept these, not as recompense for my poor behavior the other day... ...l was a boor, but as a token... ...for my respect and esteem for you. They're beautiful. And my apologies to you, sir, for any discourtesy on my part. -It's Chris, isn't it? -Yeah. Chris, sometimes I need to be reminded... ...that the way a man acts where I come from... ...crosses a line in a more refined culture like this one. I assure you, I meant no slight. A joyous holiday to both of you. And health and happiness in the new year. Merry Christmas. And to you. That was nice of him. -You didn't buy that phony routine? -He apologized. Oh, yeah. All he needed was a cape and a wind machine. Oh, stop. Give me 10 minutes alone with that greaseball... ...he won't forget his manners again soon. Let's not have this conversation. That's fine by me. Ooh, pretty. -Take them home with you. -Oh, I couldn't. No, really. I'm going to Hawaii for the holidays. Why should they shrivel up in my apartment when you could enjoy them? -You sure? -Absolutely. Thank you. What part of Hawaii you going to? -The Big Island. -Oh. Well, you and Chris have a great time. I know what's up. I see a lot from this chair. Relax. I won't say a word. Okay. Dad, can we put lights in the front window? I don't see why not. You want to get that, Ted? Mom, have you ever seen snow in person? ln person? Lots of times, honey. Grandma says maybe when she gets here... -...we can drive up to the mountains. -We have a visitor. Hi, Mrs. Hoffman. -Hello. -You must be Lizzie. I brought these for all of you. Thank you. Well, I just thought I'd drop them by. Well, I just thought I'd drop them by. Could Neil help us put the angel on top of the tree? I can't stay, Lizzie. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Neil? Why don't you stay and help us decorate the tree. -I wouldn't want to intrude. We'd love to have you. -Are you sure? -Yes. Okay. Thank you. Wow, look at her. This is Santa Claus. Subtitles by SDl Media Group OCR extraction by D.Lauper
