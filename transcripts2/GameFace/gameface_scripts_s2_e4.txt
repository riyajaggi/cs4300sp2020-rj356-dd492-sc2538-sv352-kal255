 This programme contains very strong language. Being a modern woman is not easy. When do you get the time to do everything? PHONE RINGS Hello? Are the kids in the car? Have you called your mum back? Don't forget Tom's PE kit! Can I have those reports now, Susan? Straight away, Mr Dean. Three o'clock. Oh, no. Not... the Biccy Monster. Cut! That's great. Really great.

 Let's get the Biccy Monster green stuff set up. Biccy Monster? Sounds cool. Yeah, it's this sort of massive, gross ogre in a pig sort of thing. Should be funny. Yeah. Who's playing that then? No, I'm Marcella Donoghue, see? "Modern working woman..." Brackets - "Biccy Monster". I hope you like biscuits. I love biscuits. Steve, how long are we looking at? Ogre? Action! {\an1}GROWLS Give me biscuits! Give me biscuits! Give me the biscuits! Give me the biscuits! Give me the biscuits! Give me some more chocolate! Remember, Susan, you wanted to be beach body-ready. Hmm... Try some Sweet 'N' Yums to help you stay sweet and yum. Hmm...

 GULPS LOUDLY Hmm! COUGHS Oh, fuck! Cut! Dobby, Dobby, they're so disgusting! Let's go again. > Marcella, how has your week been? Yeah, good. Not been temping this week which was nice, so just, you know, got some stuff done. Oh, what stuff did you get done? 'I'm going to be doing a bang tutorial today. 'If you don't like your forehead or your eyebrows...' Life admin. I won't bore you with it. Did you re-book the test, so you can end this rigmarole with Jon? Uh... well... We should just book you in to take the test again straight away. It's just... Hey, Marce! What are you doing? I thought you'd passed your test. What? No, sorry, I don't know the way to Argos. What are you talking about? I said I thought you'd passed your test! What's he saying? I don't know. You know him? No, he's just some weirdo. You told me you'd passed it. I don't know the way to Argos. Please, leave us alone! HORN BLARES Oh, Jesus Christ! {\an1}TYRES SCREECH What was that? Sorry. Did I go too fast? Yes! Now he thinks I need a few more lessons to help me deal with things that might spook me. That's not a bad idea. What, making me spook-proof? I've passed my test. No, I mean having an Argos. Oh! I don't think we've got one around here. We could do with one. Yeah, I agree with you. It's a great idea. Since Woolworths closed down. Since Woolworths closed down, exactly. You need those shops to do the little bits and bobs. Now, this is progress. Marcella... You said you're getting 12,000 for the advert. How are you gonna spend the money? Same as always - Ubes, foods, dudes. What? She's speaking Norwegian. No, I'm not. Ubes, foods, dudes. Ubers, takeaway, dick. Oh. Don't write that down. I'm only joking. I don't pay for it. I'll pay for takeaways and Ubers. I'm not an animal. Right, Marcella, looking over your session notes, you make a lot of statements about how you don't enjoy the feeling of powerlessness that you have over your life. You talk about starting a podcast, about writing a play or a film numerous times. In one session, you even talk about ideas for a country and western album. # I guess I got the bad audition blues # They didn't like my acting, I had nothing to lose... # I thought these sessions were confidential. Your notes make me sound unhinged. I'm just trying to work out here if there is in fact any real, genuine dissatisfaction here that's not being addressed or if you're simply happy being unhappy. What are you gonna do to make the most of this windfall, to get the things that you say that you want? Things that you can have! I thought she was just doing research. I feel like I need a lawyer. Answer the question! I've joined a writing class. It starts on Saturday. Sit down, child. Good. Maybe you can use the money to freeze your eggs! What... Sorry, no, it doesn't work. Um... It's not an authorised technique, Frances. Yes! 12 grand gone into my account! Here is to the fucking horrible, horrible Biccy Monster. Biccy Monster. Biccy Monster. So, who's staying out for a celebratory margarita nightcap? Oh, no. After all that wine? Anyway, I can't. Billy's coming round tonight. I have to go as well. I think I'm gonna have to break up with Mark tonight. Why? It doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about it, to be honest. It sounds ridiculous. OK. Lucy... He didn't know what a fish finger was! What? Hmm! These breaded fish things are so moreish. SHE LAUGHS What? They're... They're fish fingers. Fish... fingers? Oh! Is that what they're called? I can't tell if you're joking. Why would I be joking? Never heard of fish fingers before? Oh, here we go! No. No, I haven't. In the same way I haven't heard of chicken noses or beef toes. I suppose this counts against me, doesn't it? I'm sorry I don't know the street lingo for your breaded fish goujons. I get it. Class war. I guess me and Lucy just thought you and the rat would make it through the barricades. Be serious! I need to go out with someone more... Not him. You don't have to do it tonight. You could do it another night, then you could stay out with me and have a celebratory margarita with your friend. Yeah, fuck it. Just one. Yeah, yeah. I want to be up early in the morning to start my creative writing course. I'm off. You're both coming to Billy's housewarming tomorrow night, right? Do you mean Billy and Simon my ex-boyfriend's housewarming party? Nah, probably gonna swerve it in case Tania actually kneecaps me as she keeps threatening via text. Right. Bye. Bye, traitor. I take it you two went hard last night? The margaritas betrayed us, Luce. Honestly, I think they were out of date. Out-of-date margaritas? Sure, Marce. Come on, I need a wee. No, no, no, no. Come on, out. I need to have a shower. No, just... I won't look. You have your writing course today. You can't miss the first one. No... Aagh! I'm doing this out of love. Why, Billy? No! Stop it! Stop it! Enough! You can go to the toilet, you dickhead. {\an1}RETCHES {\an1}DOOR OPENS {\an1}I thought you might have a sore head, so I bought you some things. Ibuprofen, Coke, salt and vinegar crisps. How did you know I was hungover? You don't remember, do you? Get it done. Hi, Mark. Firstly, thanks for... you know. That's a good beginning. It's good... Going well. But fish fingers, come on... No, serious. Can't even be serious for a minute. I do love you. I love him through the barricades. No, what are you doing? Check about beans. See if he knows about beans. Beans. Do you know what... What, Marce? Do you know about beans? Of course I know about beans. Not me! I know... Rat-arse! Does he know about... He's on the phone! Ask him. Hello? Hello? It was... hilarious. Marce made me have so many margaritas. But you, uh... You did say, "I love you." I remember that. OK. I love you too. It's nice to know that you do love me. You love your little rat. {\an1}SHE LAUGHS And I know what beans are. Now, do you know what fresh produce is, my little peasant? OK, welcome, writers. Sounds very basic, but the first rule of Write Club is we don't talk about Write Club. We write about Write Club. We do talk about the writing as well, but you get my drift. OK, uh... you! Me? On the count of three, draw your pen. One, two... Oh... Three. OK. OK, uh... No, I meant in a "draw your sword" kind of way. You know, pens at the ready! Oh, OK. Oh, it's very nice. Sorry. It was a late night. I just didn't quite understand. Seems like I'm in a class with a bunch of bright sparks. What? Nothing. Drink your liquors, eh, darling? BREAK
