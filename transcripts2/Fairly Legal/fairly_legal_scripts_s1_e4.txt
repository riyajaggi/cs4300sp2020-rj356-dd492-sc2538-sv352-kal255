 Fairly Legal (2011â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 4 - Bo Me Once - full transcript 
 Kate is mediating a dispute between the host of a cooking show who made a very popular barbecue sauce, and the company he made a deal with to manufacture it. Kate eventually learns that the host is not the actual creator but his producer who prefers to stay anonymous. But a man shows up who says he's the producer's father and the true creator of the sauce and demands his share. Kate learns that her father abused her which is why she keeps a low profile. Lauren tries to get all of her late husband's clients to stay with them. And she meets with one who's clearly a chauvinist, who decides he doesn't want her to handle his business. Lauren turns to her step-son, Spencer for help and he gives her some advice. And Justin's boss is pressuring to close a case of trespassing wherein a guy broke into a house he thought was his. Justin makes a plea deal but his boss is not satisfied with it and tells him to speak to the owner of the house that was broken to. Justin learns the owner is a friend of his boss and that she's acting out of spite and paranoia because the man has a criminal history.

 Uh, yes, sir. Well, yeah. No, loose plans. No, I understand. You know, I can swing by the office and, uh, pick up the case files. Here, taste this. No, that's all right. Actually, I use my Sundays to catch up on work. Actually, I'm in court. Would you taste? Please. Please. I'm in court, and... Oh, okay. Oh, my God. No, that's fine. I... No, I hear you. I'm, I'm going to make this a top priority.

 Yes, sir. All right, I'll talk to you later. Thank you. All right. Great. Well, why is the DA calling you on a Sunday? Right? Like I don't have enough to do already? Yeah. I have the opening for the Landreu case in the morning. Then, I've got, like, 40 other cases sitting on my desk. Mmm. Okay. What was the case about? A guy got drunk and he broke into his neighbor's house. Busted up a bunch of stuff, but left without stealing anything. The victim wasn't home, but I guess that freaked her out, so now she's pressing charges. Really? That's it? Well, it seems like there should be a little more to it than that, though.

 I don't know. Maybe. But I guess I just have to get it done. You know? Really? Okay. Justin. Okay. Taste this. Stick that spoon in my face one more time, I'm going to knock it out of your hand. Please! Listen to me. Just taste it and I'll drop it. Promise. This is it. Not bad, actually. Did you make that? Yes. I lied. One more. You might want to... Get a... This. Okay. Okay. Also not bad. You're beginning to disprove my theory that cooking outdoors is strictly a male pursuit. All right, Cro-Magnon man. Last one. Okay, wait. Why do you have three... mmm, different but very similar barbecue sauces? Mmm. Mmm. Research. I've been hired to mediate this dispute between a TV chef and a company that he's using to manufacture his signature barbecue sauce. They're fighting over flavors. I happen to think it's money. I see. So, this barbecuing that was supposed to be a Sunday thing, is actually a work thing. Oh, coming from the guy who spent half of Sunday on the phone with his boss? Yeah, coming from the guy who actually has to get back to the office. What? I'm sorry. Justin, no. I do. I'm sorry. Please? I'll come back. Wait, wait, wait. Just one second. It's your phone. I'm going to go. No, no, no, no, no. Just one second. I'm sorry. Yeah. Lauren, uh. Hey. It's Sunday. I'm barbecuing. I am in the office, calling to remind you that Frank Griffin wants this barbecue sauce mediation resolved by the end of the week. It's been going on for months. That's right. I've got to go, okay? My meat is burning. Is that a metaphor? No. I wish. I just want to make sure you understand the pressure, Kate. Yes. Uh, you have made it clear to me. On a Sunday. And I will see you tomorrow, which is Monday, a work day. God, she bugs me. Ugh! God, she bugs me. You two are unbelievable. Have you ever heard the saying "It takes sugar to get honey"? If you use venom, you will get venom. Well, you're just full of wisdom, aren't you? Why don't you keep it coming, huh? Yeah, I'd love to. But I've got to go. Work before wisdom. Your meat is burning. Is that a metaphor? I wish it was. Your meat is actually burning. Oh, my God. Justin. Just grab the lid. Watch out. Well, it's not burning now. Look, Bo, I love your little cooking show. We're the most popular cooking show on San Francisco public television. And once this barbecue sauce takes off, we'll be even bigger. Well, exactly. So, why are you making it so hard for me to take the damn thing to market? You're the problem. Oh, come on! You're going to blame this on me? Come on, pal. Are you kidding me? Okay, all right! Okay, so, Frank, Bo does not like the sauce that your company has produced. Right? I made it to his exact specifications. The exact amount of white pepper. The exact amount of cayenne. It's not authentic. It's not spicy, it's not full of life. It's not Bo. Do you know how many versions of your damn sauce I've made? Seventeen. This is the first attempt. I remember, too much vinegar. Not good. Number eight. Fifteen. Not horrible. But a little too sweet. What's the point here? Hold, please. Suite number 11. Too much salt. She's right. Interesting. You know, Bo, I got your recipe from the case file, and then I made a batch of barbecue sauce. And I put that sauce in these cups. They're all the same. See, I knew it! Wait a minute. That doesn't prove anything. You can't tell the difference! Come on. The point is, something's bothering you, and it's not the sauce. It doesn't taste like Montana. He's right. Okay, good. Great. Are we really having this conversation? Well, do you want to settle this or not? So, Bo, um, tell us. How does Montana taste? Yes. Come on, Bo. All right. All right. I can do that. You don't have to play this game. Look, Beth, you're a fine producer, but this is a food thing. Okay? I got this. Montana is a feeling. Okay. And how does Frank translate your feelings into flavors? Thank you. Let me tell you how I learned to barbecue. It isn't just about cooking. It's about family. It's about community. People would come from miles around to share the food. Just to be together. There you go! This animal lived well. So, let's be respectful and cook her well. I'm just trying to find a way to put that feeling into a bottle. I'm not trying to be difficult. I'm just protecting my brand. And I want the sauce to be... As authentic as my life. You know what the problem is. It's the label. I should have just gone to court instead of hiring a mediator. No, no, no, no. Listen. You want people to taste Montana? You've got to put Bo's face on this label. It's like, uh, Burt's Bees. You know, the beekeeper. You see that beekeeper from Maine on all the products, and you think it's the real thing. There's personal connection. Like Ben & Jerry's. No. Yes. This is crazy. He's using cheap ingredients. No, no, no. Beth. I think Katie's right. Kate. My name's Kate. You know, Frank has done good work. The last version of the sauce was pretty darn good. If we change that label. I'm tasting Montana. I can see it. All right! Okay, good. So, then, are we all agreed? We've got the last version of the sauce inside. Bo's pretty little mug on that label. And we've got ourselves a deal? Right. Hey, let's put this sauce in every kitchen in the country. Ah. Talking my language. There we go. Montana! Where is she? Uh, she is working. You know Kate, always working. On a mediation. A work mediation. Mmm-hmm. When will she be back? I'm guessing when she's done working. The firm has been carrying Teddy's membership at the Pacific City Club. We're not going to renew it. Okay. Kate will just need to go over there and sign some termination papers. You're putting Kate in charge of paperwork? Kate, who never does paperwork for anything, ever. I just found an unpaid American Express bill from 2003 in her desk drawer. But, yes, if you want me to, I will tell her to get right on it. No. You're right. I will take care of it myself. Thank you. It might be more productive. I'm just saying. And did you have any prior dealings with the defendant, uh, Margo Harvey? Well, I've never been invited to any of her little cocktail parties, if that's what you're asking. Just answer the question, Sam. Your attorney's giving you some good legal advice, Sam. Answer the question. This is a waste of time. What's the big deal? The big deal is that you trespassed inside your neighbor's house, breaking a window to get in. My client has offered to make full restitution. Can we wrap this up? Sit your ass down. Why don't you take a seat, Sam? It's a Class B misdemeanor. I'm thinking 14 days suspended, pursuant to completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. Plus, 100 hours of community service. All right, we'll talk. Come on, Sam. Thank you. Where is everybody? Lunch. It's a cooking show. Yeah. But they don't eat here? It's weird, isn't it? Yep. Contracts. Congratulations. Or, should I say, well done. Cooking humor. Yep. Yeah, not very funny. Nope. Only on occasions that are rare. All right, that's it. You're out of here. Thank you for this, though. I wanted to, uh, get everyone's signatures before they change their minds. You want me to wait for the signatures? Hey! Oh, no, no, no, no. It's okay. I'll just meet you back at the office. Hey! Where is everybody? Yo, buddy! Can you, uh, can you just stop with the honking? It's not Buddy. It's Bo. Bo? Big Bo. Uh, Bo's dad? Oh, no, no. Beth's dad. You know where she is? Beth? Beth, the producer? You're Beth's dad? Taught her everything I know. Name's Maddox. Friends call me Bo. Are you going to help me find my little girl, or should I ask someone else? No, no, no. I'll, um... I'll go get her for you. Rip these up. Okay. Why? Bo, our authentic chef? He's a fraud. This whole show is a fraud. Okay, look. You don't know the situation. I do know. You had no right to do that. I thought it was a good idea. Are you kidding? How does putting your face on a crappy sauce make it taste better? I don't think it's crappy... What are the two of you talking about? How Bo's not really Bo? What? What are you talking about? What... what's she talking about? How did you figure it out? I'm incredibly perceptive. And there were just a few things that didn't make sense. Oh, and Big Bo, the guy who passed down his authentic knowledge, he just pulled up in his truck. My dad's here? Yes. He's here. He's on set and he is waiting for you. Oh, my God. I can't... I can't deal with him. I'll talk to you later. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Beth! Beth. Hey. Where are you going? Beth. Great. You're leaving? Where are you going? Beth? What the hell? Why is she leaving? Uh, they had a falling out a couple ofyears ago. I don't know why. Maybe because she didn't tell him about the show? Yeah, I don't think she did. Which doesn't make sense. Because that story that I told? That was her life. The thing is, Beth, the meat will only be as tender as the man who's cooking it. All the kindness and attention you put into making it. That's the goodness people taste. Beth inherited her dad's cooking skills. She knew all the recipes. But she didn't think people would watch a woman barbecuing. Truth of the matter is, she's not that great in front of the camera. So, she hired an actor to front for her. Yeah. Mmm. So, uh, when we would do the show or make personal appearances, I'd pop in the old ear bud. She stands off to the side and channels her dad. Wow, Cyrano. Without the love. Yeah, I guess. It worked, though. Well, it seemed authentic. Yeah. You know you're going to have to tell Frank what's going on. What? You're his partner and you're defrauding him. Ah. So, good luck with everything. Bo. Well, basically, it's a Class B misdemeanor. P.D.'s looking for 14 days suspended. I'm going to offer 30. Rehab and 100 hours of community service seems about right. Talk to the victim. Well, she gave her statement to the police. It was pretty clear cut. Talk to her. It's misdemeanor trespassing... Is it? I don't... Maybe it's a felony. Okay. Maybe. Because, you know, Balfus has two priors. Both felony convictions. He's got a snatch and grab robbery when he was 19, and a simple assault. It was a bar brawl, about 10 years ago. You bump this up to a felony, that's going to be his third strike. The guy might be a sneering prick, I'm just not sure he deserves 25 years to life. Talk to the victim. All of our citizens deserve to be heard. Wouldn't you agree? I will talk to her. Yeah. Let me know how it goes. All right. And on a weekend furlough, Willie Horton committed armed robbery, assault and rape. No. Justin, this is different. No. Yes. Willie was already a murderer. Sam Balfus? He's a petty criminal. You sure? Because what if he gets out... Okay, what if you put him away for 25 years to life only because he got drunk and he broke into a neighbor's house? Could you live with yourselfwith that? Well, the DA wants me to file this thing as a felony. Did he say that? No. He's too smart for that. But I know that's what he wants. Well, what do you want? To not be haunted by this 10 years from now. Which means... Good afternoon. May I help you? Hi. My name is Lauren Reed. Teddy's wife. Yes. I'm here to terminate his membership. Oh, my. Yes, of course. Can I tell you how much we all miss seeing him? Every Monday for lunch. He was a constant. Uh... Every Monday? Would you like me to take you to his table? Um... Well, it... It is lunchtime. I'm so sorry, I didn't cancel the reservation. I hope you haven't been leaving it open. No, no. Teddy's standing lunch has continued using it. Thank you. Hello. Oh, you. Excuse me? You're Teddy's girl. I'm Teddy's wife. Yeah, whatever. And you are? Lou Fisher. Fisher Real Estate. That's right. Right. Oh, well, I am so glad to have this opportunity to meet you. As I'm taking over all of Teddy's accounts, we'll be working quite closely together. Sorry. I almost snorted my scotch. Yeah? You won't be handling anything of mine. And, uh, you won't be staying for lunch. Out of respect for Teddy, I, uh... I've been avoiding your phone calls. But... Now that you're here, I'll tell you to your face. You're fired. Well. That, thank you, is going to make for one very awkward lunch, isn't it, Mr. Fisher? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Kate. Yeah. I have a client waiting. What do you know about Lou Fisher? Uh, that was my brother's account. Lou was Teddy's client. Socially. So Spencer did the actual work? Smart lady. How long did Spencer work for... Adi?s. Ciao. Auf Wiedersehen. I thought you'd be halfway to Kansas by now. Coffee? Uh, no. I'm wired as it is. All right. More for me. So, you and your dad. You've been out of touch. Yeah. For a while. Why? Is it about the show? All right, help me out here. Um... You seemed to have a perfect childhood, and the actor who played Bo, he was telling stories that you told him. Did you make any of those up? No. No. They were all true. Okay. So, you have true stories told by a fake Bo, about a great guy, your dad. He shows up. You run. This... this doesn't make any sense. All right, fine. You want to have secrets from me? From Frank? You want to blow the whole mediation? Go ahead. I'm not interested. I've been living two lives. I always have. Go on. Everyone always said how they wished they lived at my house. How they wished my dad was their dad. Because... Everything was perfect at our barbecues. Until the other families went home. Then my dad started drinking. And he changed. Everything changed. My mother did the best she could to keep him away from me. Which meant that she was the focus of his anger. I begged her to leave him, but she said that he'd find us. That leaving would only make it worse. I read somewhere that we spend most of our lives trying to recreate our childhood so we can recover from it. Which means creating a better Bo. Yeah. But now, I can't control him, either. Oh, Beth. So, I guess you really can't escape your past. Beth, we need to get you out of here. Why? I am so sorry. Your dad's coming. Oh, my God. I didn't know. Uh... Don't worry. We've got this back entrance. Kate. There's my little girl. Mr. Resor is here. Anyone need anything? No. We're... We're fine. Thank you, Leo. We're more than fine. We're having a family reunion. Hello, Elizabeth. Look at you, all piss and vinegar. All grown up. Why don't you sit down? Excuse me? This is my office. My rules. So, sit down. That's no way to start a negotiation. I thought it was a family reunion. It's both. What do you want? You know, the Internet is a magical thing. You discover something new every day. Such as Burnin' With Bo. Suppose you and me go somewhere private where you and I can discuss how the real Bo is going to get paid for your stealing... All right, hold on. You know what? ...his stories, his recipes. Back up! Come on, little darling. Girl, we've got some catching up to do. You're hurting... Just come with me. You're hurting my arm. All right, stop. My dad died recently. I went through his stuff and I found this. Or it's a prop from the set. Or it's a lighter. Or my ex-husband, who's the ADA, he gave it to me for protection. Now, which one do you think it is? Get the hell out of my office. So, Annie, you got your gun? Call security. Already did. They were on their way up the stairs when you pulled out your, uh... Very realistic looking paperweight. Teddy did some work for the Chief of Police, and that was his thank you. Beth, I am so sorry. He said that he was in town, he just wanted to come by and say hi. I told him that we were having a meeting. I had no idea. As soon as he showed up, I should have told you the whole story. Do you think he's gone? Security will make sure that he leaves the building. And Leo is going to escort you home. Will you take her out through the back door? I was going to tunnel through the building next door. But this is better. It wasn't real. Maybe. I saw your assistant in there on the phone. Big, fancy office. He's calling in the cavalry, instead of leaving Beth and me to work this out ourselves. Oh, is that what you were doing? You were working it out? Because to me, it looked like you were trying to intimidate her into giving you what you wanted. She's using me. You can't copyright a recipe. You have no legal ground to make a claim. She stole my life. She might say the same thing about you. So, what do we need to do to get you to crawl back into your little hole? Twenty-five grand might do it. Plus, a piece of whatever else that show brings in. Okay. I'll talk to her and I'll get back to you. You know, I'm not happy about having you up in my business. Really? I'm having a blast. Set up a meeting with our best real estate attorneys to discuss the Fisher account. Bring in outside counsel if necessary. Hey. Hi, Spencer. Hey. Sorry. I got your messages. But I had a crazy night with Lila. Yeah, no, no, no. Just thank you for coming in. Yeah. Yeah. Um, wow. I can't stay long. She's got this cold, and... And Terry thinks it's allergies, but I... Um... Yeah. Yeah, you really don't want to hear that, do you? No. No, I do. I do. No. You want to talk about Lou Fisher. Well, if you're in a hurry. That guy's a prick, isn't he? Yes. And let me guess. He's constantly threatening to pull his account if we don't lower our fees, right? Well, he didn't present the fee-lowering option. Really? Yeah. That's new. Yeah, well, so am I. To him. Which is why he says he's leaving. Yeah, but don't take that personally. He's been saying that he's leaving ever since he got here. Look, Lauren, here's the deal. Lou never trusted my dad. My dad never trusted Lou. That's why they had lunch together every single week. What, to... To express their mutual distrust? Exactly. Hmm. Well, he won't even have lunch with me, so... Well, that's because you're not a man. Well. What... What am I supposed to do here, Spencer? I have been through all of these accounts. We have done everything this guy has asked for and more. All right. First thing is forget about these files. Because there's only two things in the world that Lou Fisher cares about. Yeah? Tax restructuring, so that he can screw the government out of money. Uh-huh? And scotch. Huh. Hey, get our best tax lawyers in here. I'm gonna go say hey to Kate. Yeah. Well, she's not here. Because, you know, it's morning. So, you know. Right. Well, tell her I say hi. Okay? Hey, wait, wait. Spencer. Yeah. Thank you. Make sure it's good scotch. All right? Yeah. All right. And a bottle of great scotch. Thank you for coming in. Just have a seat there. Happy to do my part. Aaron said I was in good hands. The District Attorney, Aaron Davidson? Yes. Huh. Okay. Um... So, according to the report, during the break-in, nothing was taken. Is that right? Do you think this is about money, Mr. Patrick? No, I'm just trying to ascertain... I don't feel safe. Don't you think I'm entitled to feel safe? Yes, of course I do. Well, then, put this cretin away, where he can't do anyone any harm. Did you have other problems with Mr. Balfus? I don't know why the Parkers think he's a good caretaker, but he's been to jail. The whole neighborhood knows about it. Well, that was a long time ago. So, we're going to wait until he does something worse? Is that how this works? Well... Do the right thing, Mr. Patrick. Do your job. Good day. Yeah. $25,000? Yes. And a share of anything else that comes out of the show. We should just pay him. Oh, no. No. What? You can't pay him. Well, why not? Well, first of all, do you guys have $25,000 just lying around, waiting to be paid to an extortionist? No. No! And secondly, he doesn't want $25,000. He wants to see ifyou will pay $25,000. And then, he's just going to ask for more. I ran away from home. I built a new life for myself. So, I'm supposed to leave that, too? Well, it seems like running just gives him another chance to catch you. He's right. Thank you. So, I can't pay him, I can't run, what am I supposed to do? Look, Beth, you're not the little girl you used to be. You are a kick-ass business woman. You need to confront him and show him that he can't push you around. I... I can't do that. Oh, yes, you can. I'll help you. Okay. Here's the deal. We drink some great scotch. We play some pool. And I tell you all of the reasons why you would be crazy to leave Reed & Reed. Sounds painless. Well, you haven't seen me play. Rack 'em up. Okey-dokey. This isn't in my job description. Oh, there are lots of witnesses, he is not going to hurt anybody. No, I mean this whole outside thing. There's just too much sun, and the breeze and everything. I mean, couldn't we have just met at a nice coffee shop or a boxing match? A boxing match? It's the sport of kings. No. That's horse racing. We have different kings. Okay. Here he comes. Kate, we should back up. You're about as hard to get rid of as a bedbug. Here are the ground rules. You can talk to Beth, but out in the open where I can see you. And if I see anything that even smacks of intimidation, I call... What was his name? Lewis J.R. Jackson, Junior. Mr. Jackson. You remember him? Don't you owe him a $5,000 bail bond? The Internet is a magical thing. Yes, indeedy. Okay. Here he comes, all right? Whoa there, little Betty Wetty. Deep breaths, Beth. Deep breaths. Tell him he's got five minutes. You've got five minutes. Oh, you and I have got more to talk about than five minutes will hold. No, you're here to talk about what you have to do to make him go away. That's it. We're... We're only going to talk about what I have to do to make you go away. I already told that annoying lawyer. Have him tell you. He needs to tell you, Beth. Tell me. $25,000 and a piece of the show. And if I give you that, you'll go away? You'll really miss me. Just answer my question! Yes, I will go away. Well, I'll think about it and I'll let you know. You know, I was not happy when your mother wouldn't let me know where you'd gotten to. Stay there. Don't tell me what to do, young lady. Get out of there. You've got a nice situation here and you are going to learn how to share it with your own. Ahh! Oh, my God. Get away. This is not over. Bo, are you okay? You look like you're in an incredible amount of pain, but... Other than that, are you okay? Other than that, I'm okay. Okay. Good. Uh, call 911. I'm on it. Nothing's changed. Nothing's ever going to change. Beth. Take care of him. How am I supposed to do that, exactly? Beth, what are you doing? I'm not going to let him hurt any more people I care about. I am done with you! Get out of here and don't come back! You know, those are some pretty strong words for a girl who's living such a big lie. It's a shame I'm going to have to tell everybody on your little show what's really going on with you and Bo. Well, I already called Frank. I'm going to tell him myself. Doesn't make any difference. What I'm going to do to your... Hey, Bo, do you hear that? Police are coming. Kind of makes you wish you hadn't tried to extort your daughter, now, doesn't it? Hey, I didn't do anything like that. Really? $25,000 and a piece of the show. Now, in the last 30 minutes, you have committed assault, battery, and extortion. You put that with bail jumping, and I'm thinking, what, 20 years? I hope this is a fast truck. You better get going. Oh. Not fast enough. Goodbye, Dad. Yeah. We can amortize all those investments and decrease your tax liability, sir, by 22... 22%. Very impressive. Mmm-hmm. Yep. I know. All right. Oh... Oh... Wow. Yeah, well, at least I impressed you on the important stuff, right? You know, I've got to say. I had you all wrong. Mmm? Yeah. You're more than just a pretty face. Well, thank you, Lou. Yeah, those are some pretty good ideas. I'm going to have to tell them to my new lawyer. See what he thinks. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. New lawyer? You're still going to leave? Yeah. You don't think I'm going to have a girl lawyer? A girl lawyer? Yeah. Thanks for the booze. Hey! You! You, sir, are unprofessional and out of line. And well, God, you're just plain ridiculous. Oh, yeah? Well, what are you going to do? Cry? Hey. Stop it. Hey, let go. No. Let go of my arm. You don't deserve a lawyer like me. Keep your voice down, okay. No. I... Oh, God! I drank scotch. And I hate scotch. And I gave you 15 great ideas on how to save your company time and money. And it doesn't matter, because I am a girl. Come on, let's talk about this someplace else. Ooh, ooh! I am done talking. Ms. Reed, please. The other members. Right. No. Good. You know what, Lou Fisher? You're fired. That's right. He's fired. Ms. Reed, let's get those termination papers. Yeah, you got it. Uh... Almost forgot my scotch. I'll be back. I'm starting to like her. Mr. Davidson. You wanted to see me? I got a copy ofyour filing, the Sam Balfus case. Yes. You filed it as a misdemeanor. Yes, I did. Why? Because it's the right thing to do. Is it right for Margo Harvey? Is it fair to her? Well, it's not what she wanted. No, it's not. I'm sorry. Do I work for her now? You work for the people of San Francisco. Well, do the people have a problem with the way I do my job? Because I haven't heard it from them. I have. Oh. Let me guess, her name is Margo? There's a lot of politics in this job. I know that. No, you don't. Nobody wants a DA's office who's weak on criminals. Understand that? Republicans don't want it. The Democrats don't want it. I don't want it. I told you to take care of that case. To be tough. That's your job. My job is to enforce the law. To make sure money isn't being wasted. Where people go to prison for a quarter of a century because some woman who plays tennis in the middle of the day calls you by your first name, Aaron. You were already over the line. Now, you're just flailing in that space beyond bad judgment. I'm going back to work, sir. Yes, Lauren. Don't give in. Excuse me? Whateveryou do. Kate, you are woman. You've got to hear you roar. Are you drunk? Anyway, I'm just saying. You've got to mediate those odds. Uh, Lauren, umm... I'm a little busy right now. Uh... Oh, hello? Bad connection, I've got to go save our deal. Me, too. Hello. Um, you know, I... I, uh... I. I'm going to... I'm going to sit down. And Bo, Bobby, was my employee. He... He signed a confidentiality agreement. He can't be held responsible. This was all my doing. And I'm really, really sorry. Yeah, Frank, look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry, too, bro. You knew about this? I just found out. And we came to you as soon as we cleared up some other matters. I've invested a lot of money in Bo's Authentic Barbecue Sauce. Yes. Which turns out to be fake. Well, the sauce is real. And it's good. I was buying the whole package. The whole damn fake package. Which is worthless! Frank, listen. There is no excuse for their deception. You are absolutely right. But Beth and Bobby, they would like to go on with their show. Their fraud. No. They will fully disclose the nature oftheir relationship to the audience. Right. I'd rather cut my losses than be in business with people I don't trust. Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way... Goodbye, national name recognition. It wasn't really your name. You know, just give him a week or two to stew. And if he still doesn't bite, Reed & Reed has a client that's a specialty food chain in Napa Valley. And we can talk to him, and we'll see what he says. You sure you still feel like doing the show today? If not, I'm happy to do it. I... I kind of have a knack for things that lay in the kitchen. It's my specialty. You know, you just get the coals a little hot. Whoa! I'll... I'm just going to go. I'll just be over there. This is all your fault. That's a really nice thing to say to the person that picked you up off the street. I was upright by the time you came. Yeah. Afternoon. Hey, hello. God, I hate Lou! Yeah, everybody does. Lou hates Lou. I am going to keep his business. He is not going anywhere. I don't doubt it. Not for a minute. Excuse me. Hey, sweetheart. How are you? Umm, yeah. I've got to go, okay? Mmm. Thank you. No, yeah. I'm getting in the elevator right now. Okay? Yeah, I'm going to lose you. I got to go. Okay. Oh, Kate, Spencer was here. When? Uh, just now. And earlier. Oh... Oh... Hey. Uh, that phone call before. What was that about? What do you mean? You were drunk. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, Lauren, yes, you do. Come on. You were flat out drunk! Kate, enough! I don't have time for this. I have work to do. What? So, are you... Are you sure you're in the doghouse? Well, let me put it this way. That second defendant in the drug ring is up for prosecution. Davidson gave it to Sanger. Sanger? Yeah. The drooler. Yeah. Oh, my God, Justin! You were brilliant in that first trial. That's a very nice thing for you to say. In fact, I can't believe those words just came out of your mouth. Okay. I've been trying to tell you that for years. All right, all right. It's true. That's why I don't give you any compliments. Because you get all gooey and it goes right to your head. Thank you. That moment is completely lost. Anyhow, I'll be fine. I'll dig my way out of this. Oh, I doubt it. I'll just have to try harder. There aren't enough hours in the day. I'll be smarter. Justin, you can only work with what God gave you. I'll cheat. Now, you're talking.
