 (PHONE RINGING) Hi. LEONARDO: Don't be late for Judge Nicastro. Are you kidding? I'm up. I'm ready. I'm... Good morning. Good morning. ANDREW: Look, this is ridiculous. AGENT: We're seizing your boat. What about due process? Come on. I live here. Not anymore. (CHUCKLING) You can't be serious. Andrew. I'm so glad that you called me.

 Who are you? My name is Kate Reed, and I'm his lawyer. Okay. No one is setting foot today on Mr. McKinnon's boat but Mr. McKinnon. Ms. Reed, your client is in violation. He filed the wrong paperwork. I didn't file any paperwork. Which is still wrong. But he's not a drug dealer. He's an idiot. I just didn't file the paperwork. Which is idiotic. The point is... The point is, this is America. We don't board. We do not seize. We're not pirates. So, go take down some bad guys and make us proud. Goon. Let's go.

 This matter needs to be resolved. And resolved it will be. Don't leave town. Bad. You know, if I knew a little customs issue was the only thing... No. No time for flirting today. Mmm-mmm. I am almost late, and I can't be. You see, this judge he totally hates me. So, call me at the office, and we'll discuss this later. Thank you. You're welcome. I didn't even know you were a lawyer. I'm not. Well, I used to be. Then, how are you going to... Don't worry about it. I've got it covered. Right. LEONARDO ON PHONE: Judge Nicastro's office called. Well, did you tell him I'm here? I'm here. If you're there, you can tel! him yourself. Judge, I'm here. I'm just saying. You like football, Ms. Reed? Is that a trick question? Let's start again. Oh. Um... Yes. I love football. No, I hate football. Is that the right answer? I'm not in contempt of anything, am I? Ms. Reed. Yes, sir. There's a high school football coach I know. Old-school disciplinarian. Strict. Tough. Sounds familiar. Well, anyway, Coach Gardner went after a kid in practice. The quarterback. Really tore into him. Somebody caught it on video, and the school has suspended the coach. And, well, now, a group of parents are trying to get him fired. Mmm-hmm. Anytime a faculty member is suspended, mediation is triggered automatically. So I'm... I'm assigning the case to you. Because I'm the best? Because you love football. Got it. Um... Coach Gardner was your coach? No. Then, he's your best friend? Uh... Not exactly. Judge? Oh. (LAUGHS) Well, my son... Oh, Bobby. Yeah. Yeah. Bobby. He's turned out to be a fine young man. But there was a time when that was not a likely outcome. Ha! Mmm. When he was a teenager? Teenagers rebel, Judge I mean, that's just what they do. And teenagers with strong fathers rebel even harder. Bobby was running full speed down the wrong path. Down a lot of wrong paths. And then, he found football? He found Coach Gardner. Mmm. The coach took all that anger that Bobby had, and he made him put it on the football field. He learned respect for the people around him, respect for himself. Respect for old-school disciplinarians. I very nearly lost my son. Coach Gardner saved him. I'm late for court. Judge, sorry. Just one more thing. Mediators are impartial. So, I'm just not sure... I don't want to see him railroaded. Just be fair. I can do that, sir. I'll be watching. Closely. That's comforting. I don't want to hear any pissant excuses, Riley! If you're too stupid to look at your watch and get here on time, you're too stupid to play on my team! You hear me? Now, when you get your head out of your ass and start acting like a man, then you can play! Until then, you sit down and shut up! What are you looking at? Let's go! Hustle up! Okay. Who wants to go first? (ALL SHOUTING) (WHISTLING) (ALL QUIET) That was my son. It could easily have been any one of ours. This is a pattern of behavior that has to stop. We need to end this. We need to fire that man. I understand that you guys are upset. But this videotape does not give us any context in which to fire him. Well, yes, it does. I mean, the physicality... (ALL SHOUTING) (DOOR CLOSING) Coach Gardner, did... I'll be right back. (INDISTINCT ARGUING) Coach Gardner! Whoa! Coach Gardner left. Oh, yeah. He took the stairs. Why didn't you stop him? 'Cause he's a football coach. I couldn't even stop a guy like that in a video game. (SIGHS) Damn it. Anything I can do? Yes. Please. Reschedule for later on today. Phew! Great. Why is that great? I thought you were gonna ask me to chase him down the stairs. Kate. (PHONE RINGING) You know what? I should get that. Kate. Yes. Hold on. Wait. Don't move. Kate Reed's office. (CLEARS THROAT) Justin. Hi. Oh. Yeah, sure. Hold on. It's Justin for Leo. That's weird, isn't it? Hmm. What happened with the school mediation? Why did the coach just leave? Leo! All good. Rescheduling. They've all been rescheduled for this afternoon. See? Told you. Hey. It's Justin for you. Kate, I am really concerned... (PHONE RINGING) Oh! Hold that thought. I should get that. You've got to be kidding me. I want to hear what you've got to say. I've just really got to get this. Kate Reed's office. Andrew. Yeah, um... Hold on one second. Uh... It's a... A new client. Andrew McKinnon. Yes. I'm gonna be awhile. So... Yeah. Um... You know what? I haven't had a chance to, yet. But why don't you give me your number? Okay. I'll call you later. Yeah. Promise. Bye. What was that about? Oh, it's just this thing. With my neighbor. Mmm. I thought he was a client. That, too. It's a pro bono. He got cited for a customs violation, and I'm just helping him out. He's just a nice kid from Australia, Lauren. Oh, great. What's the issue? Failure to declare funds over $10,000. Well, did he file his paperwork with Customs and Border Protection? No, he didn't. But you know what? I'm actually... I'm just starting to research all of that. I'll take it. What? I said I'll take it. Pro bono, Lauren. For free. What do you know about Customs Law? That we have books about it in the law library. You mess up, we'll get sued. Oh, okay. It's a money thing. All right. My world makes sense again. You probably want to know why Justin is calling me. Actually, I don't. It kind of fits in with the rest of my day. Where you going now? To get the other half of my mediation back. (EXCLAIMS) (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) Oh, excuse me. Yeah. Sorry. Is Coach Gardner around? Yeah, I saw him in there. He'll be a while. Hi. Hey, babe. Yo. (GAS PS) Whoa. Lady. You're in the wrong locker room. No. No, I'm not. The girls' locker room is in full compliance with all the codes and the regulations. I wish I could say the same thing about the guys'. And you're from the... San Francisco Department of Building Inspection. Yes. You don't look like a building inspector. What does a building inspector look like? Hmm? You know, I am old enough to be your... ...mother's very, very young sister. I'm sorry, but I don't see you carrying a tape measure or a. I don't need a tape measure to know that... Uh... These lockers... These lockers right here... (EXHALES LOUDLY) Are in violation of the Code. Because they're too old? Small. They're small, fellows. I mean, they're okay for girls' lockers. But for guys? I mean, you guys... Um... You guys need, uh... Man-sized lockers. GUYS: Yeah! I mean, where are you gonna put your... Your man shirts and your man pants? In these teeny, tiny little things? No. What about the Sports Illustrated cut-outs? (GUYS AGREEING) And the Victoria's Secret models. (CHEERING) Those girls, they need room in your lockers. ALL: Yeah! Oh. Oh, oh! And, right here, I'm pretty sure there is supposed to be... A Jacuzzi. (ALL AGREEING) That's right. Dreams can come true. I just need one teeny, tiny little thing. What? The name of the person in charge. Coach Gardner. He's right down the hall. Thank you. (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) RICK: Coach, it's not like that. I will not stand by... You hear me? I will not stand by... What's going on here? (SIGHING) Are you Rick Riley? Yeah. I'm Kate Reed. I'm the mediator that's handling the case between Coach Gardner and the school. Don't you have class? Go. Well, that was interesting. Yeah. That was private. No. We're past private, Coach. What's going on? Why did you leave the mediation this morning? I need answers. Look. Those people don't know the first thing about what I do. Those people are the parents of your players. Yeah. And they all want the same thing. They want the results without the hard work. Okay. But they have the right to question the behavior of the person that they entrust their children to. What, are you defending them? No. I'm just saying that they have the right to ask questions. Especially after seeing that video. And they might have more after I tell them what I just saw. Now, if you don't like what they're saying, then fine. Say something back. The school wants to hear your side. Judge Nicastro wants to hear your side. It doesn't matter what I say. (BELL RINGING) That's what's different now. The parents run the school. All right. Well, if you want to do something about that, then I suggest you get your ass to mediation this afternoon. And this time, you keep it there. 2:00. So, here's the thing, Mr. McKinnon. Andrew. Andrew. You have to declare large amounts of cash on entering U.S. waters. I know, annoying. But it's the law. It's not for the Andrew McKinnons of the world. It's for the drug dealers and money launderers. I'm entirely in favor of having those guys arrested. I mean, they spoil all the fun for us, right? Well, if you conduct a transaction over $9,999, the government tracks it. You were flagged at the bank when you got your cashier's check. But I had to buy a new mainsail for my boat. Ten grand? Is it Mylar? You sail? LAUREN: Yeah. My father taught me when we were kids. Just dinghy sailing. Do you still keep up with it? Yeah. My... My late... Husband had a boat. But now, I'm... I'm just much too busy now. Well, you're never too busy to sail. I mean work, sure. Just to make enough to fix your boat up. (CHUCKLES) So, where are we with this thing? Well, usually, Customs seizes all undeclared currency. Please tell me you're not serious. That's how they pay for those nifty jackets. Oh, no, I... But don't you worry about it. I'm not going to let that happen to you. We'll file the correct paperwork, you'll pay a small fine, and you and your very fancy mainsail can be on your way back to Australia in no time. Puerto Vallarta, actually. Or the San Juan Islands Or Vancouver. Oh. But, I'm not leaving just yet. Well, I will contact you as soon as all the proper paperwork has been filed, Mr. McKinnon. Thanks. Andrew. Andrew. Yeah. Have a nice day. Yeah. Thanks. You came. I want to make a statement. Thank you for coming back. Now, in a mediation, it's very important for both sides to be heard. Um... Am I missing something? Excuse me? You saw the video. There is only one side. Mr. Riley, there's always another side. You humiliated my son. You benched him on the biggest game of the season. And you know how many scouts were out there. NICASTRO: It just doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, the man you're describing is not the man I knew. Well, Joe Riley has not pressed assault charges yet. I got him to agree to a mediation between the school and the insurance company And then, after that, we're gonna talk about charges. The coach has done a lifetime of good. Now, I am not trying to make excuses for the crap he did today. I just... I don't want people losing sight of all the wonderful things he did yesterday. Okay. I'll, uh... I'll see what I can do. Let's shoot a little higher than that, okay? Yes, Judge. (KNOCKING) KATE: You are one lucky moron. Joe Riley's not taking you to court. Yet. We're going to sit down with the school's lawyer and their insurance company. And you better hope we can work something out. Do I have to testify? No. Not unless it goes to court. Good. Yeah. You'd be horrible on the stand, wouldn't you? You know, I don't get you. You've got all this stuff, but you're just destroying it. They gave me until 4:00 p.m. to get out, okay? Oh. Well, let me help you out. I don't need any help. No, it's okay. I don't mind. I'm an excellent packer. So, Coach... What are you going to do when you can't coach anymore? Have you thought about that? Are you gonna be the host at a restaurant or something? Or... No, no, no. Don't touch those. You have that kind of charm, you know? You have a way. You can just make everybody feel welcome. Oh! This is fast packing. Right? Come on. This stuff... It's all meaningless. Just... Just stop. Just like everything else in this office. What are you gonna do? You gonna punch me, too? Oh, jeez! KATE: Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. Don't worry about it. Somebody will clean it up. See, I don't need your help or anybody else's, okay? (GROANS) Don't, don't, don't, don't. Yeah. What? Give me that. What do you care? They're men now. Good men. They've earned the right to be on that wall. How do you know? Because they call. Okay? They send me Christmas cards. They come see me after Homecoming. They find me. Adam Lee. He's a... He's a banker in New York. Ben Jones is a coach. And John Harper is an artist in the Mission. And Lou Tomasino, he's a... He's a fifth grade math teacher. So, you like the players. Of course I do. Why else would I do this? Not for the money. I've got a car that's older than these kids. Yeah, but you didn't like Rick Riley. (SCOFFS) You don't know what you're talking about. Coach, I saw the video. Oh, you saw the video. Well, that makes you a freaking genius, doesn't it? Evening. Thanks for saving my ass this morning. Everybody needs something to sit on. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't introduced me to that fantastic woman. And that would be? Lauren. She's amazing. Lauren? The blonde. The lawyer. She's taking care of everything at no charge. I'm in very good hands. No. Uh... Amazing? Really? Yeah, and... And funny. And interesting. And stiff and icy and cold. Uh...With the... (STAMMERING) Lauren Reed? She's great. Anyway, thanks, Kate. Good night. And I'll have the New York Strip, medium, and the souffle for dessert. WAITER: Sure. It takes 20 minutes. WAITER: And for you, sir? Just the Caesar. Thanks. So, you're probably wondering what this is all about. Not really, no. You're not even curious? You need a favor. Um... And it has something to do with Kate. And I'm guessing since her birthday is coming up... Okay, all right, all right. Stop. Okay. Let me explain. Because the fact that you figured all that out makes me seem extremely lame. You have absolutely no idea what to get her. All right. Stop. Okay? You figured me out. Look. When we were married, we had a strict "no presents" policy. Right? We would just do stuff together. You know, maybe go out for the night. Whatever. Just making time for each other was great. Now, we're not married. No, you're not. And last month on my birthday, Kate had this delivered. That's nice. And now, I don't know what to do. You could return the jacket. No. Are you kidding me? Not an option. No. No, I want to get her something special. You spend more time with her than anybody I know. Can you please help me with this? What's in it for me? Well, there's this little jaywalking ticket that keeps bouncing its way back to your old address. Whoa. Hey. You know what? I am here to help you. I love that about you, Leo. Yeah. Mmm! Souffle, huh? Joe Riley's here with his lawyer. I put them in the conference room with the insurance rep and the lawyer for the school. Got it. Thanks. Hey. Quick question. Godzilla, Mothra, King Kong. If you had to pick one. First instinct. No wrong answer. Mothra. Mmm. Would you describe Lauren as amazing? Funny or interesting? No. More like pinched, precise, kind of annoying, right? That's more in the ballpark. That's what I thought. All right. I'll be in the conference room. Good morning. I trust that everyone's met one another? Mr. Riley. His attorney, Robert Kenton. Laurie Davidson. Ms. Reed. Yes. Before we begin, please make it clear to Mr. Kenton that Coach Gardner was suspended at the time of the incident, and therefore, the school cannot be held accountable... Please inform Ms. Davidson... ...for his actions. ...that suspension is not termination, and therefore... Okay. Suing the school because a suspended member of the faculty punched a guy for egging him on is not the home run case of the century. Oh. LAURIE: Thank you. However, Coach Gardner, though suspended, was still a member of the faculty at the time the incident occurred. And he did assault a parent in front of witnesses. So, I'm sure that we can find a reasonable middle ground. Oh, come on. That's ridiculous. Joe... No. No. No. Come on. Gardner berated my son. He benched him, and then he assaulted me. There's no middle ground. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (CLEARS THROAT) Leo, we're in the middle of a meeting. LEONARDO: It's an emergency. Your son collapsed in practice. He's been rushed to the hospital. Then, I'd like to take him home as soon as possible. No, Doctor, that is not an option. No. Not unless you're telling me... We just walked in. Okay. Fine. I'll meet you there. I've got to go meet the doctor at his office. Rick is in a recovery room. I heard. They're probably giving him more fluids. He was dehydrated. Oh, was that it? Well, I think so. The doctor was too busy covering his ass to say anything more specific. Listen, Kate, I really appreciate you keeping me company on the ride. Oh, sure, sure. I was more than happy to do that. Good. And, I guess I'll just reschedule the mediation for when Rick's feeling better. No. Mr. Riley, we can make this work. There's no reason we have to go to court. You know what? I'm just going to drop the whole thing. The mediation, the assault charges, everything. Really? Are you sure about that? Obviously, the stress of this thing with the coach is the reason Rick is in the hospital. I am still ticked at that guy for what he did to me and my son, but I am going to suck it up. Listen, I've got to go find this doctor's office. And get my son out of here before he catches something that might actually harm him. Thanks again. You're welcome. I didn't really do anything. (INAUDIBLE) LAUREN: Kate. Yeah. How's the assault mediation? Um... Good, good. Yeah. Everything's fine. You know, the dad just decided to drop everything. Oh, wow. Yeah. Why are you being nice to my friend? I was better equipped to take the case. (SCOFFS) And I wanted to know if your friend, McKinnon, was related to another McKinnon. The Australian billionaire. With a "B"? Yes. Is he? We do a small favor now, maybe it pays off for the firm later. I knew you weren't being nice. Define "nice." Watching you guys is like watching one of those weird rain forest bird territory dances. Well, who has the better feathers? Makes me so uncomfortable. Why don't you watch shows about humans? Huh? Touche. Hey, is this video cued up? LEONARDO: Yup. Heat lamp, electric blanket, or thermal underwear? (SIGHS) Electric blanket. Leo, any more of these triptychs, and I'm gonna have to ask for an explanation. And I'll give you three. Cute. If you're too stupid to look at your watch and get here on time, you're too stupid to play on my team! You hear me? Now, when you get your head out of your ass and start acting like a man, then you can play! (REWINDING) ...watch and get here on time, you're too stupid to play on my team! You hear me? Now, when you get your head out of your ass and start acting like a man, then you can play! Hey, Leo. Until then, you sit down... LEONARDO: Yup. ...and shut up. Can you come in here for a second? Does this kid seem scared to you? You're too stupid to play on my team! You hear me? Not in "there's an angry, muscular man "spitting in my face" kind of scared, no. Until then, you sit down and shut up! Hey, look. The kid says something. Where? It's after the coach stops talking. Thanks, Leo. Rick? Hi. Kate Reed. Remember me? Yeah. How are you? I guess I'm doing okay. That's good. Hey, listen. I re-watched that video of Coach Gardner benching you. Look, um... My dad's just filling out some forms. He's gonna be back in here in a second. Okay. I was just wondering, what was it that you said after he stopped yelling at you? I don't know. Nothing. Really? Because it looked like you said, "Thank you." Kate, look. I really don't feel like talking right now. Okay? Okay. Okay. You know what doesn't make sense in this situation? That you would get reamed in front of all of your football friends, and then say, "Thank you." So, man up. The truth, Rick. What's going on with you and Coach Gardner? He caught me doing steroids. It was just a stupid mistake. But if anyone found out, I'd get kicked out of school, and there would be no way that I could get a scholarship to college. So, I begged him not to turn me in. And then, the yelling, that was... That was all just a show? Yeah, I promised to stop, and he said that he'd just bench me until the stuff left my system. I don't want any pissant excuses, Riley! If you're too stupid to look at your watch and get here on time, you're too stupid to play on my team! Now, when you get your head out of your ass and start acting like a man, then you can come back on the team! Until then, you sit down and shut up! Thank you, Coach. Coach was just being nice. Yeah. He was being awfully nice. So, is that it? I don't know. Is it? Nobody is making any sense. You know, I just... It just doesn't make any sense to me. What doesn't make any sense? The icing rules of hockey. I just don't get it. I mean, you've got the... It was the blue line, right? It's not really my... KATE: And... Not my game. (CHUCKLES) So, you're just hanging around the hospital? (CLEARS THROAT) I was just visiting a friend of mine, and I thought I'd see if you guys were still here. Yeah. I signed you out, bud. Let's go. Bye, Rick. Kate. You've caused me a lot of trouble. I didn't make you punch that guy. Honey, who is it? It's that mediator. MRS. GARDNER: Invite her in. Yes, please. Thank you. So, why didn't you tell me he was taking steroids? He's a good kid. He made one giant mistake. I couldn't bring myself to ruin his future by having that on his record. Coach? With all due respect, you're lying. (CHUCKLING) You know, you and I, we're never gonna see eye to eye on this. So... We're not. We're not. You went through the trouble of screaming at him, benching him, all so that nobody would find out he was taking steroids. But then, you get suspended, and you still don't say anything? Last year, the basketball coach turned a kid in. He got kicked off the team. He was never much of a... Of a student, that kid. But without the structure of practice, without the team, he fell apart. Dropped out. So, you thought you could handle things better than the system? Well, the team is the system. And it works. We've been turning boys into men for decades. Yeah, but you can't do that all by yourself. I tried to call Rick's father. Over and over. But he wouldn't talk to me. So, then, you just decked him? I had good reason. Here, I've got something for you. Keep them somewhere safe, all right? Give me that bottle. What? Give me that bottle. Coach, it's nothing. What, are you kidding me? Give me that. You taking steroids is bad enough. No. But your father dealing them to you? Are you kidding me? Coach, it's not... Shut up, Rick! I'm not going to stand by... You hear me? I'm not going to stand by and have this kind of... What's going on here? So, by the time I found out that Rick was getting steroids from his father, I'd already been suspended from coaching. So, that's why Joe was so eager to get Rick out of the hospital. He didn't want the doctors to find out what he was giving to his son. Have you called Child Services? (SIGHS) Not yet. Look, they'd yank him out of his home. I went to the hospital to find out if he had any relatives he could stay with while this thing was getting sorted out. But it turns out, no, they're all back east. I feel like I let him down. Poor kid's all alone. No, he's not. Okay. I asked Kate to choose between Mothra, Godzilla, and Kong. And she picked Mothra. What are you talking about? Her other answers were electric blanket, corduroy, and plutonium. Are you kidding me? It all adds up to the perfect gift. Which is what? A... What, a monster with a radioactive blanket that makes a noise when you rub against it? An iPad. Excuse me? Kate's answers confirm what we already know about her. She's a woman with a million interests and the attention span of a cooker spaniel. Plus, they're really cool and everybody wants one. I can't believe I let you scam a meal from me. Hey, if you've got a better idea, I invite you to go down in flames with it. Well... I didn't think so. Tell you what. Give me your credit card, and I'll go pick one up. And I'll wrap it, too. I'm one-stop shopping. Fine. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah. Come in. Am I disturbing you? Oh. Mr. McKinnon. Sorry. Andrew. Yeah, no. Please. Please come in. These are for you. Oh. They're lovely. Mr. McKinnon... Andrew. Just so we're clear... As much as I enjoyed working together the other day, I am in the middle of... You wouldn't take any payment for your services. The flowers are my way of saying thanks. Well, thank you. I'll be seeing you, Lauren. Yeah. Pleasure doing business with you, Andrew. Yeah. Thank you again. They're really beautiful. Mr. Riley, hi. How are you? Thanks so much for coming in. We're gonna go right back into the conference room. Okay. I'm not quite sure what we have left to talk about. You know, it's just some paperwork. Mmm-hmm. Formalities. Minor stuff. You will be out of here in no time. Okay. All right. After you, sir. Thank you. Mr. Riley, I would like for you to meet Judge Nicastro. And why is there a judge here? Oh, he's just kind of an agent of the court thing. Right, Judge? Correct. Have a seat. Now, the beauty of a mediation versus a court trial is that, in mediation, both sides come out winners. But in order to get those really good outcomes, you've got to make some concessions. (LAUGHS) Concessions. Here's what you're going to do. You are going to write a letter on behalf of the other parents to the school district, insisting that Coach Gardner be re-hired. And then... You're going to sign this. Uh... You know what? I'm not going to sit here and listen... You provided steroids to a minor, Mr. Riley. Your son. In direct violation of school policy and the law. A felony. Open the envelope. Your son will live with Coach Gardner and his wife for the remainder of the school year. He will be tested regularly to make sure that he's clean. You will enter a counseling program of my choosing. As long as you remain in that program, you will have supervised visitation with your son. And you sign those documents, and you get a concession, too. And what's that? We don't have you thrown in jail. GARDNER: Wow. Couldn't have been easy for Joe Riley to give me temporary custody, huh? Well, he liked it better than his alternative. Mmm. Are you sure you're okay with him coming to dinner every night? Oh, yeah. I think it's good. The boy needs to see his father, and Joe Riley needs to learn to act like a man. A little adult supervision won't hurt that. Yeah. I talked to Rick, you know, and he seems pretty happy about it. Yeah, he is. (GRUNTS) I think he's relieved. Yeah. So, how's your suspension coming along? Oh, it's great. My assistant coach is doing great. It's relaxing, really, you know? Yeah. Just being an observer. Yeah. I like it. (YELLS) Come on, Clark! Pretend you're alive! It's like a vacation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you finally got what you wanted. Which is what? You thought that the parents were the problem, and now you get to coach one of them, too. (CHUCKLES) em you. (YELLS) Waylon, come on! You call that getting off the line? Hi, Kate. One day early? I am impressed. Do you like it? Justin, I love it. It's perfect. Well, you know, we've known each other a long time. Yeah, but still. I mean, a boat toaster is a little off the beaten path. A boat toaster. It might be the best present you have ever given me. Well, you know, I just, uh... Had a feeling. You know, I really like our new tradition. What, you getting me something beautiful like a coat and me getting you something practical like a boat toaster? KATE: No, like... You put thought into it. You know? And we never used to try that hard. Well, I'm glad you like it. Listen. Let me call you right back, okay? Okay. (PHONE RINGING) Kate Reed's office. Where's my iPad, Leo? She loves her toaster. JUSTIN: Where's the iPad? It's my fee. What are you talking about? A boat toaster costs, like, 10 bucks. Yes, but she loves it. How did you know she was going to love it? Well, Justin, Kate's a busy professional with impeccable taste. Plus, she lives on a boat and loves toast. Can't argue with that. Goodbye, Leonardo. Goodbye, Justin. Hey, Leo. Can you get me some bread? (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
