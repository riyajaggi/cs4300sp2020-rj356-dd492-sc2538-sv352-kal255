 Fairly Legal (2011â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 2 - Priceless - full transcript 
 Despite resolving her cabbie's coffee-war with a biker on the road, Kate is late for a business client, forcing Lauren to take over, but she dares not enter her late husband's office to retrieve the case file. Justin asks enthusiastic Kate to prevent an embarrassing jury trial on damages the treasury can't afford for Steve Janks, who was released after 22 years of innocent incarceration. It gets even harder once Steve realizes he can't get his social life back anyhow. The Reed family is agonized by the impending reading of the late patriarch's last will.

 I'll be there, Lauren. I'm on myway. Morning. Hi. What's going on? Today is the reading of the will. My father's will. It's a big deal. Oh. Not really. I mean... It's not for me. Yeah. All right, give me a break, Leo, okay? I'm on my way. Seems like a big deal. I'm looking at this as, um, an opportunity for a fresh start. Coffee? Coffee. Look at you. No. I'm good. My assistant's making me some.

 Oh, I hope he is. Yeah. I'll be here. Spencer, I'm on my way. You feeling all right about this, this morning? Yeah. Good. You know, I'm just looking forward to moving on having this over and done with. Well, if you get here, then it will be. That's why Dad made you the executor, you're so logical. And he knew you would never do it. Yup. That, too. See you soon. Raymond? Raymond? Have you seen my assistant? Oh, he's, uh... He's... Raymond. Good talk. Raymond, I never got my morning briefing. What... Where is my stapler?

 I don't know. You're fired. I'm what? You're fired. Why? I didn't take your stapler. Well, you have been late four out of the last nine days, you left a blank page on a collated document that went out to a client, and you know what? Even if you didn't take my stapler, you certainly didn't prevent it from being taken. So, goodbye, Raymond. Where is Kate? Almost here. I just talked to her. Found Raymond. I fired Raymond. Lucky, lucky man. I'll be there, Leo. I have no doubts, which is why I got pastry things for Lauren and a black and white cookie for you. Oh, then I really am coming. I'll be there in five minutes. You keep sniffing your coffee. Oh, yeah, the aroma's amazing. This coffee will change your life. Only if you drink it. Yeah. Justin, hi. You busy? I'm on mywayto the reading of Dad's will and I'm running late and Spencer and Lauren are going to think it has something to do with the will, which it doesn't because I don't really care about the will. I mean, as long as Lauren doesn't get very much. Or anything at all. But you know what? She can have it because that's not even what I care about. I mean, it's just, like... Kate. God, I don't know, it's the... Kate. ...will, it's the finality... Listen, this new Janks case. Oh, that goes to court today, right? Wrong. They pushed it 48 hours because they want to try mediation. Fantastic. That's so much better for him. And the city. Yeah, I mean, he was in jail for 22 years and he was innocent. If this thing goes to court, it's a PR disaster. You didn't get my email? Um... Was that the one about... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey! You almost hit that guy on the bike because you were sniffing your coffee. I don't think so. One sec. Okay, you know what? Just pull over, all right? I'm going to walk. My office is around the corner. Here. Get out! Hey! Kate? Let me call you back. You could have killed me! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Get your hands off! Hey! Hey! Wait! Get out of the car! No! No! No! No! Hey! No! You just about hit me! Stop! Break it up! You crossed over! You cut me off. You! You didn't even see him. Yeah, I know, I leaned down for one second to get my coffee and this guy... Whoa, whoa, you were drinking coffee as you were riding your bike? I get it at this place in the Mission District. Hand brewed. He wasn't even paying attention. Oh! You were sniffing your coffee. Okay. Hand them over. Coffees. Let's go. I'm a busy girl. Move. My gosh. Now you're fighting, driving recklessly. You almost killed him, you almost got killed, now you want to kill each other. For what? For coffee? Come on, right? Now go on, back to your places. Now, think about having a decent breakfast when you wake up in the morning, that way you're not craving so much caffeine to get you going. Have some eggs, all right? That's a much better way to start your day. Or you know what? A piece of fruit. Yeah. Bananas are great! Ooh. Oh, my... This is ridiculous. Lauren. No, let's reschedule. Can you please wait? Her time is not more valuable than mine, Spencer. In fact, it's worth a lot less. She's crossing the street right now. We can get this done today. Hey. I am so sorry I didn't call you back. Did you read my email? Is this about the other night? You've been assigned to Steve Janks' mediation. With his lawyer and a lawyer from the attorney general's office. This morning? Should I get someone else? This is a big case, I need the best. Taxi! Yeah, we're going to have to reschedule. Didn't Steve Janks come from a broken home? And he spent all of his time playing ball at this vacant lot here behind Tommy's Market. Hey, you little punk! What the hell do you think you're doing? Get back! No! Robbery becomes murder. Hey, stop! Hey, you! Hey! Ah! Oh, damn! Kid with a gun walks into a family grocery store and grabs all the money from the register and runs. Simple. Until the owner has a heart attack and dies. Exactly. An eyewitness identified 18-year-old Steve Janks as the gunman. Then he spent 22 years in prison. He was exonerated by DNA evidence and the confession of the actual robber. Mmm-hmm. This guy certainly deserves to be compensated. Right. So settle this case and he can get on with his life. Plus a trial is just going to be drawn out and expensive. Not to mention embarrassing for the DA's office. There was clear misconduct. There was withholding of information. It wasn't my case, was it? I didn't say that it was. Then what are you saying? That both sides have a reason not to go to court. Exactly. Both sides. Right. So why are you getting so upset? Why are you defensive about this? Is this about the other night? Kate, I gave you this case. There are other mediators out there. Yeah, but none that are as good. Right? I'm not mad... All right. What is it then? It's just, I put bad guys away every day. Okay? Most ofwhich you never hear about. Nobody does. But then something like this comes along. It's a mistake. It's tragic. But the press gets a hold of it and suddenly my office, guys like me, we're the bad guys. But that's the press. You know the truth and that's all that matters. Just keep this thing out of court for everybody's sake, okay? They're going to be here in a half an hour. Mr. Snyder, did you ever take the prescription drugs... Asked and answered. On the morning of August 5th, were you impaired in your ability to make a clear decision because you took the prescription drug? Asked and answered. Mr. Snyder, do you have a prescription... Asked and answered. Do you have a problem, Mr. Collins? Yes. You're wasting my time. I'm not the one obstructing... Asking my client questions that have already been answered, which implies, correctly, they've already been asked. I don't see how that's possible as this deposition just started this morning. By Teddy. Teddy? You knew him, right? I am taking over all of Teddy's cases. Goody for you. So there might be some overlap in the questioning... I'm not billing my client while you play catch up. Teddy already asked these questions. I'm sure there's a file in his office. Do you know where that is? Or do you need me to show you? My assistant was recently fired, which is an explanation, not an excuse... Let's reschedule. I don't do that. You know, I'll go get Teddy's file and I'll be right back. Wait here. You want to take me on? You with the $10 flat shoes, huh? Oh, really, Harry? My shoes? Is that how they taught you how to argue in mail order law school? You know what? Forget this. We're going to court. Oh, wait. I was a lawyer so I do know juries and I'm telling you right now, they are going to be so sympathetic to an innocent man who spent 22 years behind bars. Exactly. And they will be equally unsympathetic to a bus bench lawyer who's looking for a big score. Everyone can win with mediation. All right, uh... The purpose of this mediation is to put a price on the 22 years that Mr. Steve Janks spent in prison for a crime that the state has acknowledged he did not commit. Is it okay if I call you Steve? That's my name. Okay. So, Steve, would you like to make a statement? This country was founded by men who believed in freedom. Freedom from the pressure... Oh, God. What? You don't believe in freedom? This is not going to work. It's our first meeting. And it's going to be our last if he wants to start with the American Revolution and move forward from there. Harry, you know, we're just trying to get a sense of what everyone's thinking, so why don't we stick closer to the specifics of this case. All right. Okay. I get it. Let's not talk about justice for all. Let's talk about justice for Steve. Hmm? What would his life be like if he hadn't spent most of his adult life in jail? Well, we don't know, do we? Because that's speculation. You can't base a judgment on that, right? We need facts. Well, here's one. 22 years ago there were no iPhones. The Internet was being used by scientists who liked to talk to each other. No Amazon, no Facebook. Harry... What? What? You don't like facts now? Because I've got another one. Steve Janks got an A-plus in computer science. He liked to fiddle around with computer parts in his garage. He had dreams. He had ideas. He knew he wanted to do something big, maybe even something that would change the world. I mean, that's... That's the way kids think. Like that Facebook kid who started in his college dorm room. And then there's Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and maybe Steve Janks would have become more famous than all of them, more important, more wealthy. But we'll never know because Steve Janks didn't get a chance to show us what he could do. He missed the whole Silicon Valley gold rush as he sat in jail for over 20 years until somebody pushed him out the door with $40 in his hand. And you ask me what is fair? What a fair settlement is between my client and the state of California? Twenty million dollars. Which would also send a message that this should never happen again to anybody else, ever. No, no, you're going to be paying for the shipping. Betty, I need the notes for this... All right. May I help you? I need the notes for the Snyder deposition. They're on the desk. Could you please get them for me? Teddy Reed's office. Mmm. Mmm. That's excellent. Betty, please go in the conference room and tell Mr. Collins we need to reschedule. Shall I give a reason? Make one up. Twenty million dollars? How does the state of California feel about that? Well, each state makes its own determination as to what's fair when compensating the wrongly incarcerated. Some pay nothing. Some pay a flat fee. We use a different metric as determined by the state legislature. And Mr. Carl, with his fondness for American history, will no doubt appreciate its democratic nature. It doesn't matter who you are, you get $100 a day. So. One hundred by 365, by 22, well, that's a lot of money. $803,000. Mr. Janks, what you went through, well, I can't imagine. And on behalf of the people of California, I'd like to multiply the standard compensation by a factor of three to take into account your pain and suffering. That's 2.4 million dollars. And it's very generous. All right, um... We have two numbers and they're pretty far apart. So what do you think is fair, Steve? I speak for him. This is not a court. He can speak for himself if he wants to. Steve, this is complicated. I need you to talk to me, tell me what you want. Whatever you guys decide is fine with me. Really? Yeah. This Steve Janks is a complete mystery to me. I can't figure out a fair settlement because I have no idea who he is. He has no family, he's lost contact with all of his old friends and how can a man not have an opinion about what he wants? Maybe he's just not comfortable talking to lawyers. I mean, I know I'm not. Look how little you know about me. I know everything about you. You've never been to my house. That's true. I'm kidding about my house, which is an apartment, executive, one bedroom, actually. And you know what? My neighbors hate me, but that is not my fault. I lied for you. The deposition. I told shiny suit there was an emergency and I rescheduled for tomorrow. Very good. Thank you. One other thing. Next time you need a file from Teddy's office, get it yourself. Page 17, paragraph two. Oh, is that all you got? Hey, Kate. Hey, Steve. How you doing? Great. Swing's still there. Yeah? Power's not but it'll come back. You know, I went to the halfway house looking for you. Yeah, I'm never there, but I'm always here. Do you want a beer? A beer? Yeah. No, I'm good. What... What's with all this? For the boys when they come by. Ah, the boys. Like the old days. That's right. You want to see some hitting, wait till Joey D. gets here. Of course, Sam's gonna tell you he's the one with the pure swing, but he's just talking out his butt. Have you called him? Ah, someone will show up. That's how it works. That's how it's always worked. Steve, you know, your friends, I'm pretty sure they've all got jobs and families. I don't know if they're gonna just show up. Well, I got other friends. What was it like in prison? No big deal. Really? Because I'm trying to imagine what that would be like. There it is. If I was arrested for something that I didn't do and I'm stuck in prison for 22 years... That would be a really big deal to me. I'm gonna go for a walk. I can do that now. Isn't that nice? There it is. See if we can track down anybody from Steve Janks' past. We've got to find somebody who can talk to this guy. Sure. Okay. And don't forget about the end of the day. Mmm-hmm. The reading of your father's will with Spencer and Lauren. I know, don't eat my cookie. I'll be there. I know you will. Not. Sounds like you're in a good place with this mediation. You got two offers on the table. Steve Janks can start his new life. I can't settle this. You don't settle, this thing goes to court. I know. Maybe it should. What is this about? Money? No. This is about a guy who has nothing inside. So reach a settlement so he can figure himself out. I can't. He's stuck. He went to prison for two decades and he's acting like nothing ever happened. Well, that's his business. No. That's my business. Look, if this goes to court, this thing could drag on for a year, okay? And there will be a settlement. There'll be a big one. Now is that going to help Steve? I don't know, Justin. I don't know. Maybe it would. Know this, schools will close. Oh, don't use scare tactics with me. Please. It's not scare tactics. They're facts. What do you think, there's just some big pot of money sitting out there untouched that only you can reach in and use? There's one pot, Kate. And if it all goes to one guy, what are we going to say to the firemen and school teachers that lose their jobs? Okay, my office won't be able to hire more lawyers, criminals will be set free... If I don't figure this guy out, he's going to explode and then he's going to commit a real crime and then your office is going to be dealing with that. That's fine. That's my job. Well, it's my job to make sure that doesn't happen. You always do this, okay? You always make it personal. And you always hide behind the system. Settle the case, Kate. What is best for you may not be what is best for Steve Janks. I need more time. Sorry. You hate it when somebody else is right, don't you? I am meeting Spencer and Lauren for the reading of my father's will. I missed it the first time you called for this mediation. I'm not missing it again. I'm on myway, Leo. I've got the number of Steve's old girlfriend. You amaze me. True. I also have a list of Steve's friends who testified on his behalf at the trial. Really? Well, how many of them are still living in San Francisco? Ten or 12. Okay, send me all their info and then book me a table at the Chop House. A big one. For when? 5:00. Steve Janks is gonna get a big homecoming. Spencer and Lauren are still in the conference room. Right. Which means that I am stuck in traffic. So you have to reschedule. Exactly. Taxi! Steve! Where are you going? This is your party. I can't go in there. Why not? Just forget it. Oh, no. Come on, come on. Just come inside. Just have one drink. Nah, I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to be in a place like that with those people. Yeah, but it's Joey D., it's Sal, it's Lisa. They're your friends, the ones you hung out with, you played ball with. Right. Yeah, my friends. So I go in there and pretty soon someone says, "Hey, buddy, what have you been up to?" And I say what? Yeah, but they don't want you to be anything other than who you are, their friend Steve Janks. And they don't know who that is. Not anymore. Someone's stealing staplers. They're disappearing off people's desks. And you think I'm taking them? I think you might have one I could use. What? Stop being such a child and show up for the reading ofyour father's will. And don't hog the stapler. You will do anything to not sit down with Lauren. That's not true. You're worried that she's gonna get more than you. Oh, God, Spence. I don't care about money. When have I ever cared about money? I'm not saying that it's about money. I don't understand. You're worried that somehow, the way that Dad has divided up the will, that it will look like Dad favored Lauren. Oh, so you think that we're going to open up the will and I'm going to be like, "Dad liked Lauren more than me"? Yes. God, Spencer, you're my brother and you don't know me any better than that? Kate, I know that you're avoiding Dad's will. I've had things come up. And you're avoiding it. Look, I'm not avoiding you, okay? I'm avoiding the will. And you're talking about it. Okay, all right. I'm going to go, all right? Okay. Call me tomorrow. Get your call. Hello? Hey, Kate. Steve Janks. Steve, hi. Yeah. I, um... Thank you for trying to help me. I wanted to say goodbye. Okay. What's going on? You were right. Nobody's coming back. I'm alone. Steve... Steve, hi. Kate, it's Harry Karl. Did he call you, too? He did. He was upset and he kept thanking me and he said goodbye. I got the same call. Well, I want to go talk to him. I called the halfway house. He did the, uh, thanking routine when he left this afternoon and he didn't come back. Where would he go? I don't know. I mean, the guy gets out of prison, I pick him up at a bus bench, he hasn't had a place to go for 22 years. That's true. He hasn't. Steve? Steve! It's Kate. Sorry. Steve. You have nothing to be sorry for. Twenty-two years, Steve. And you were innocent. You had nothing to do with it! Your whole life changed because of the robbery. In this store! How do you feel, Steve? How do you feel? I hear you now! Yeah, now you're talking! I was innocent! Yes, you were! I didn't do anything! You didn't do anything. It's not fair! It's not fair! It's not fair! Everybody's gone. But you're here. I'm nobody. That's not true. That's not true. San Francisco Police! Hands in the air! Get them up! I'm done. I'm done. Thank you. Are you kidding me? So, what, you're going to play criminal now? Hmm? Obviously you're not very good at it. The police picked up Steve Janks in the vacant lot just outside. Why am I explaining this to you? You should be explaining to me. Justin, this is great. Steve Janks, he finally... He finally what? Perfected his swing? No. He finally opened up. I don't care. I asked you to do one thing, okay? I brought you in to settle a case. You do that and it's good for you, it's good for me, my office, the city, the state... Steve Janks would have gotten two million dollars, maybe even three. But I told you this wasn't about money. Good. Because you know what happens now? He gets nothing. Not a big settlement, not a little settlement. Nothing. You know what he gets? He gets to go back to jail. Justin. Justin! You're free to go. But your buddy next door, he's not. Hey. Hey. I wish you weren't here. I had this dream. For 22 years, I had this dream. That thing kept me alive, that I was exonerated. I was out. And then it happened. I got my dream. Except now I don't know what I want because everything I want is in the past and the past is dead. Before you were arrested, did you have an idea of what you thought your life would be like? Oh, yeah. Did it change? Tell me about it. It's always late, night time. Come home from a job that I don't really hate to a family that I really love. My son wants to grow up to be a pro baseball player. My daughter is someone who I tell every day she's the prettiest girl in the room, and she is. And I have a wife who puts up with me, maybe even who loves me. And, uh... It's never gonna happen. Now how do you put a price on that? The week of August 5th, your clients lost a combined 16 million dollars. Which has already been... Due to your impaired judgment resulting from a combination of antidepressants and cold medicine. Is that correct? All questions related to drugs have been asked and answered. Prescription drugs. Not over-the-counter and not the combination. Try to keep up. I don't like your tone. Didn't ask if you did. I asked your client if he wants to lie on record. Uh... Yes. The combination of prescription and over-the-counter drugs led to these losses. Yes. We're done. Congratulations. You're not a liar. You're just screwed. God, she's just like Teddy. I don't want your apology. Good, because I didn't bring one. Well, there's a surprise. After 22 years and you're just going to send him back? He committed a crime, Kate. Well, what did you expect him to do, Justin? What did you expect me to do? Look the other way? Yes. He's already served his time. It's not my fault. Well, it's the system's fault. Oh, I get it. And I'm part of the system. Yes. You know, I've driven down this road with you before, I'm not going to do it today. Look, the prosecution's witness got a reduced sentence... That's old news... even though the prosecution said that there was no quid pro quo. And this is why Steve Janks got out. After 22 years. And what, you're just gonna send him back just like that because, what, because he couldn't adjust living in society for a few weeks? With no family, no job, no friends, no nothing? It's a tragedy. I understand that. I'm sorry. And that's good enough for you? What do you expect me to do, Kate, huh? Quit? Give up? I come in here every day fighting for what is right. And I want what's right for Steve Janks. I want what's right for everybody, for the citizens, the city, the taxpayers. I want what's right for that grocery store owner. I want what's right for all of them. So do I. It's not possible. Not this time. Well, I'm gonna make it possible and you're gonna help me. Betty. I need a new assistant. I bet. Yours don't seem to stay around very long. Difficult to find someone who meets my standards. Teddy was no picnic and I was working for him before you were born. I need someone who is fanatical in their attention to detail and organization. Someone whose phone manners are impeccable and whose computer skills... A monkey can type fast and a moron can answer phones. What you need is someone who will tell you that it's good to check the bathroom lock twice. But it's even better to look under the stall door. Everyone has secrets. Are you offering me the job? Because I'm due for my two weeks' vacation. Well, then we will talk when you get back. I'll see you in a week. This is ridiculous. What are we doing here? If it helps my client, I'll go anywhere. I want to prosecute it in court. I'll see you there after I get him off. The jury will back up the money truck. Harry, you see, there's... There's not this unlimited pot of money. And Brooke, you take this to court, sure, maybe the jury will knock off a few dollars to cover the grocery store damage, but the state will pay more than $100 a day. A lot more. I guarantee it. Okay, so what's your idea? The city buys the lot from the grocery store owner at a premium. Now that leaves several million dollars which were budgeted for Steve's compensation to build a community center on the lot that Steve will run. What about his settlement? He gets a salary from the Department of Parks and Recreation to oversee the center and help organize and run community outreach programs. And he pays the grocery store owner back for all the damages. Or we can just go to court. But I don't see how that's a better option for the state of California. Hold on. My client's still facing charges. Is he? Officer. Everybody happy? Thanks, Kate. I can't talk right now. Too bad. I was going to tell you I was wrong. Liar. We okay? We're us. That's a good thing, right? I'm on my way to the reading of Dad's will. You really don't want to go, do you? Why? Because of Lauren? Because it means that Dad's really dead. Yeah. Good night. You're late. I had to make sure you were coming. I'm glad to see that I can keep you on your toes. Glad to see you acting so mature. After you. No, no, no, please go ahead. No, no, no, Lauren, I insist. Please, after you. What? You opened it without us? Yeah, I was... Yeah, um, I was sitting here and I was waiting so... Okay, well, what does it say? Well, everything is distributed evenly. We all get an equal share. Okay, well, that seems fair, I guess. I guess that's appropriate. We each get a quarter of his estate. But there's three of us, so... Yeah, if we each get a quarter, that means there's one more person. Who the hell is David Smith?
