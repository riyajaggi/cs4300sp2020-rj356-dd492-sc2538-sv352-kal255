 Fairly Legal (2011â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 10 - Bridges - full transcript 
 Justin is hurt when Kate misses his legal profession award, shocked when she blurts out she's pregnant, furious when that is overruled by the doctor. Devoted stepfather Pete Marshall needs mediation between him and his dead wife's mother, who wants to take his stepdaughter (Vero)nika to her home country of Croatia, but their bickering makes her run away. Stepma Lauren fires 'rebel' Kate after meeting co-heir David Smith, whom she buys out under threat of endless court proceeding. Judge Nicastro commandeers Kate to mediate between the eternally litigious brothers Ralph and Danny Sabbatino.

 Yeah, well, I dropped it off last night and I thought maybe you'd have the results. What time does the lab open? Nine? Okay, you've done this a zillion times. I mean, can't you just, you know, hold it up to the light, you can shake it around a few times and then you can tell what... No. Of course. Yeah. No, I'm... I'm... I'm kidding. Mm-hmm.

 Well, call me as soon as you know. Thank you so much. And while I am honored to be receiving the Siegal Award, I am also painfully aware of all the people whose efforts actually made it happen. My support staff, my fellow attorneys in the DA's office, all the judges, and lawyers and employees of the court. This is boring, right? I mean, I shouldn't mention all these individual groups. Oh, yeah, whatever you think. See, you're not paying attention because you're bored. That's absolutely not true. So you're just being rude then. No, I'm... Absorbing the energy of your speech. Mm-hmm.

 You said you just wanted to run it through, work out the kinks. I suppose I should enjoy the irony. Normally you can't wait to criticize me, but today, when I actually need some constructive criticism, you can't be bothered. No, it doesn't matter. Justin. No, listen, it's because we both know you... ...have been working on this for a month, and we both know... ...it's as good as it can possibly be. What is going on with you? What do you mean? You just, I don't know, you got like this strange look on your face. Oh, my God. It's my face. Okay, I will meet you at the restaurant at 12:30, but right now I have to go get my ass kicked. What for? I don't know yet. 12:30. Is this the end of days? Oh, I'm so sorry. Wait, what? What did I do? Am I in contempt? Did I do something again? Not yet, but the day is young. You're on time. That seems momentous. Yes, sir. Well, I just wanted to show you that I have great respect for the court, sir. That will require more than just looking at your watch. Well, I don't wear a watch. Well, that explains a lot. Danny and Ralph Sabbatino. Brothers. Good luck. Okay. What's... What's the issue? Keeping them out of my court. Yes, sir. Their issue? Parking spaces. Oh. Really? That just seems so... Minor? Always is with them. This... ...is the evidence, the motions and other detritus of justice that they have filed over the years, chronicling a litany of petty complaints that have made their way into my courtroom. Their parking space dispute will not join them. Yes, sir. I will get on this. It's on the schedule for tomorrow, 9:00 AM. What? 9:00 AM. Judge, come on. I mean, these guys are clearly playing out some relationship mess through the courts. You... You can't give me one day to fix this. Yes, I can. No, you can't. You see, tomorrow morning, two miles offshore, I'm having a ceremony for my dad. I'm scattering his ashes at sea. Oh. Your dad was a great man. Thank you. So can't I have a little bit more time? No. Come on! You can do this... Probably. You can't throw me in jail if it doesn't work out. You keep telling yourself that. So Ralph Sabbatino is coming at 10:00, and Danny at 10:30? Okay, yes. Separate rooms until I've had a chance to talk to them. And, um, absolutely, coffee, muffins, cookies, anything that might make grumpy men feel warm and fuzzy inside. That would be great. Miss Reed? That's me. My name is Goran Pavlek. I am Vice Consul for Croatia. And I am in need of your help. Uh, Mr. Pavlek. Goran. Goran, yes, I'd love to help you. If you'd like, you can call my office, make an appointment. I need you to get in the car. I'm sorry but I have an appointment to get to. Miss Reed, it's important. Time sensitive. And your State Department indicated that... You called the State Department? A low level attache, but yes. They told me how you'd helped the consulates of Colombia and Nicaragua. What's this about? One of our citizens came to the U.S. to visit her granddaughter, after the death of the girl's mother. Okay. Now the woman wants the girl, who also holds a Croatian passport, to return home with her. That's sad, but that's not something that requires a mediator. But the girl's guardian, an American, objected, so now the grandmother dropped the girl to the consulate and she refuses to leave. So she kidnapped her. Ah, that is the crux of my problem. From an American perspective the conclusion might be obvious but I am afraid that the people of Croatia might see this as necessary and insist that I reunite the girl with her family. I have an appointment to get to. My job is to work for the Croatian people to build a bridge to your fine country. Right now my bridge is in danger of burning down. So you don't want this to go public. My car is at your disposal if that would make things easier. After all, we are talking about a little girl. Dirty pool, Goran. Dirty, dirty, dirty pool. I sensed you were a woman with a soft spot. Only today. Miss Reed, do you think you'll be able to resolve this quickly? I don't know, but this is a family matter so there's no reason to think it'll turn into an international incident. Get your hands off me! You can't do this! They're trying to steal my daughter! They've kidnapped my daughter! Get off! I hate it when I'm wrong. Mr. Marshall? I need to get back in there! Mr. Marshall, my name is Kate Reed. I'm a mediator. I want my daughter. Can you back up please? Hey, it's okay. Goran. Who are you? I've been brought in to resolve the situation to everyone's satisfaction. Why don't you and I go sit down and you can tell me what's going on? All right? Okay, come on. All right. I called the cops. I told them that Veronika was in there and they said they can't do anything. Yeah, well, you know, even though we're in San Francisco, the consulate is treated like it's Croatia. Even our own cops can't go in there without being asked. So I do nothing? Come on. Why don't you just sit down and tell me why did Renata go to the consulate, to begin with? Because she wants to take Nika back to Croatia to live for good and I said no. But why would she want to take her away from her own father? I'm not her biological father. Oh. Where is he? I don't know. Nobody knows. He's never been in the picture. Okay. Um... Did you and Renata have problems before this? She's a mother-in-law. She's always had an opinion about something, but I didn't think it was so bad that she would try to steal my daughter. And to Tereza, did she want you to keep Nika? We had started the adoption paperwork and then she died. I was there for Nika. Me. I held her when she cried. I made her eat, I got her back to school. Now I'm not saying that Renata doesn't love her, but I am Nika's father. Okay. I'm going to go in there, I'm going to do what I do and we're going to resolve this. You do realize the Sabbatino brothers are here. Both of them. I know. I'm stuck. Don't worry. I got kugel. What made you think that kugel was going to soften their hearts? It's like a breakfast and a dessert. Just stall them. Stall them. Yes. Keep them happy and in the building. Trust me, those guys haven't been happy since before there was manned spaceflight. You know what? It's never too late to start. Judge Nicastro's not going to be happy if I screw this up for you. Leo. Yes. I'm having a very strange day. Mediator. Yes, I understand, but Miss Reed, she's here to help us. Renata, Kate Reed. Renata, I would love to speak with you just for a few minutes, just so we can decide on the best solution for everybody, for yourself, for Pete and especially for Veronika. Hi. Goran, maybe you can get her something to eat? Of course. And you and I can go into the conference room. I go nowhere without my granddaughter. I think it would be best ifyou and I spoke alone. Just for her. She belongs with her family. Yes, but seeking sanctuary in the consulate is not going to give you that. I had no choice. Pete could not see the truth of what I said. But he loves Nika. He is not Nika's father. But that doesn't mean that he can't take care of her. When Tereza was alive, yes, they were a family. But now she belongs with me, her aunts, her uncles, her cousins, the people who knew her mother. Okay, Pete and Tereza started adoption proceedings. Are you sure this is what Tereza would have wanted? What Tereza wanted was to see her daughter grow old and have children of her own. As for this, I must do what I think is best. I will stay until I can take Nika home. When you have a child, you finally get to see what your heart looks like. It's hard when... When your heart dies before you. Can I get you some fruit? Does he look like a guy who eats fruit to you? Yeah, he's a real physical specimen. Okay, hold the in-fighting. Kate Reed's office. What? Here? Okay, don't let him in the office. No, don't. Don't. I will be right back. Danny, the kugel was good. Really. We'll all be sorry you ate that later. Real classy. Real classy of you. What does that mean? You'll have enough gas to get us over Pittsburgh. Mr. Smith. Yes. Hello. I am Leonardo. I'm Kate's assistant. Very nice to meet you. You want to get some coffee? I'm here to see Kate. She's not here. I'll wait. Okay, that's great. Let's go to the lobby downstairs so you can see her the moment that she walks in. These chairs look pretty comfy right over here. Yeah, they're very comfortable, but the ones downstairs, let me tell you. Boy, oh boy, it's some really comfortable stuff. Well, hello. Thank you so much for coming in. Sure. Wonderful. Did you come across some information for us? I'm here to see Kate. Kate? I've got something burning inside my head. You're David Smith. And she didn't tell you. That's good. Why don't we go into my office? I thinkwe have a lot to talk about. Oh, I don't know ifyou heard me a minute ago there, but, I'm here to see Kate. You have a record and a liquor license, which is a parole violation. Did you hear that? My office is right this way. Is Nika coming out? Uh, not yet. This isn't right. I talked to Renata. You both want what's best for Nika. No. I do. I hear you. Look, I can't just stand here. Okay, well, Pete, there's nothing for you to do. I'm getting Nika out of there. Yeah, but they're not going to let you through. Think about this for a second. You don't want to make a scene. Everything that you do reflects on your fitness to keep Nika. My fitness? My fitness? Yeah! I'm not a kidnapper. Okay, but you have the high ground right now. Move! Move! Peter, no! There are security cameras up there and guards! Nothing is keeping me from my daughter. Yeah, but ifyou do something crazy, the police will. I'm not letting you go up there. Told you. Yes, sir, I understand. I thought I smelled smoke so I panicked and I pulled... Ma'am, this is for you. I deserve this. I completely deserve this fine. I'm going to pay this immediately. I promise. SECURITY: Yes, ma'am. I don't see her. Well, probably because they know it's a false alarm. You're paying this. Goran, have you met Pete Marshall? This is Veronika's legal guardian. In my country, we do not call this a low key approach. Yes. That's true. There she is! Nika! Nika! Nika! Nika! Anika, they're calling the police. And I'm calling the State Department. You have to stay away from her! Shut up! Look, we have two people who want what's best for this little girl, that's a good starting place. If you call the police and you call the State Department, then we're going to have a whole bunch of people involved with their own agendas. So I'm telling you, give it until the end of the day to figure this out. I promise you, I can do this. You, come with me. Let's go. I'm not leaving. Oh, yes, you are. Because if you don't then he will have you arrested, right? I'm afraid so. See? Told you. Let's go. That's it. You died. You died. Okay, that's an Autumn Wind Ranger. It doesn't have that ability. The hell it doesn't. You see how he is? What did I tell you? I mean, rules mean nothing to this man. Your whole life, you lived between the lines. What are you talking about? You know what? Maybe ifyou lived between the lines we wouldn't be here right now. Okay, you see, this is good. You see how board games teach cooperative play? He wouldn't know cooperation if he grabbed you by the ass. Okay, Mr. Sabbatino. And you wouldn't know ass grabbing if you had to grab your own ass. Other Mr. Sabbatino. What does that even mean? I mean words, come on. Blah, blah... You little... Oh, my God, I'm becoming Kate. But believe me, when I look at that massive stack of files on my desk every morning, I sometimes fantasize about cleaning everything out. You know, just eliminating the stack, but justice doesn't come easy and it shouldn't because it's too important. But I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. We're all over-worked, we're over-stressed, under-rested... But we're fighting the good fight. Together. And for that I am grateful. And I am grateful for this award and I thank everyone very much. Thank you. Great speech! Thank you. Thanks, thanks. Great! Congratulations, Justin. Mm-hmm. Yes. Congratulations. Who are you? Oh, he's... Why'd you even bother to come? I'm sorry. Wild guess, you got held up in another mediation. Yes. Uh, I'll be waiting over here. No, no, no, you don't go anywhere. No, you take a walk. I'll wait. Okay, you leave. I will hunt you down. I will kill you. Got it. You're mad. I know. I'm... I'm so sorry. I missed your big moment. No excuses, no spirited defense of your intentions? No. What is going on with you? Nothing. I hate it when you lie to me. Do not lie to me. Justin, I'm not lying. Look, this isn't the time or the place. Oh, come on, that's crap. If you have something to say, just tell me. I'm not going to tell you. Just wait... If you have something to say to me, just tell me. Right here, right now. No, I'm not going to tell you. Okay, if you don't tell me now, then don't tell me... I'm pregnant. Nice speech. Thanks, man. All right. Hey, Tony. Congratulations. Come on. The deputy mayor wants to talk to you. Probably wants a campaign contribution. Yeah, probably. But who knows. Hey, Kate, thanks for calling me back from outside the building. What are you doing? David Smith is in my office. That's what I was going to tell you ifyou called me back. I've been busy. David Smith? Uh, well, Leo, why don't you take Mr. Marshall here into my office and, uh, maybe, thank you, give him some coffee and a magazine or something. David Smith. Wow, Lauren, I'm so glad that you two have had a chance to meet one another. I hope you're having a super conversation. Right now, I've got... How dare you not tell me you found him? What can I say? I failed sharing in preschool. Kate. Okay, really, really. We are going to talk about this. Look, I am on the verge of being sent to jail or creating an international incident and those aren't even the most upsetting parts of my day so I don't have time for this right now. Leonardo, where are the Sabbatino brothers? Conference room. Gentlemen, I'm sorry I'm late. My name is Kate Reed. I'll be your mediator today. Hi. I'm Danny Sabbatino. Nice to meet you. Hi, Danny. Good to meet you. I'm Ralph Sabbatino, if you don't mind. Ralph. Uh, here's how this is going to work, each of you will explain the problem and then each of you will propose a solution. If that solution is not mutually acceptable, I will propose a solution. If that solution is not acceptable then we all go to jail. Come on. We can't go to jail for this. What? I said that... He said we can't go to jail for this. I'm sorry. What? He said we can't go to jail... I can't hear you. What? Can you come a little closer please? I can't hear you. Okay, fine. I can hear you, but you can and you will go to jail if you continue to act in contempt of a court order to mediate this problem. So I guess what I'm trying to say, is you, you get your ass over here and you, you filed this complaint, let's go. Okay. So behind our dry cleaning store there are two parking spaces. Yes. One is for me and one is for my older, shorter, balder brother, Ralph Sabbatino. Anyway, this guy likes to park close to the lines. So last month I drive into work and this bozo repainted the lines so that my space is smaller and his is larger and now I can't even get out of my new sports car. Of course you can't get out of your car, you bought this convertible with the two big doors just so you could ding me on purpose! All right. I doubt that's why he bought the car. Why else would he have bought it? For girls? Maybe? Excuse me, Casanova, so now you're a ladies' man? Guys. I made Anne-Marie gentile. What are you talking about? What do you know? I got to second base with her mother. In your dreams. Forget about it... Hey! Here's the problem, he's a short... I'm 38 years old! I'm through with you. You're a midget. Midget? Is it my fault that I was born tall... Kate. They're never going to agree. I agree. Okay, so, uh... Yeah? Goran, hello. I'll be right there. I have to go back to the consulate. Should I send the joy boys home? No. They'll never come back. I think they want to go to jail. It'll just give them something else to just blame on each other. You, keep them there and hopefully I'll be back just in time to drive us all to jail. You ready? Stay here. If I give you the high sign, casually walk out ofthe building. All right. I thought we were going to keep the authorities out ofthis. Veronika went to the kitchen for a snack. Somehow she got past security. Where is she? We don't know. We've searched the whole building. She's not here. What are you saying? What are you saying? Speak English! This is your fault! She ran away from the consulate where you took her! Are you done? This is not going to help bring her back. Kate, I need to be out there looking for her. And you will. With me and the police. So, where would she go? I don't... She'd go home. Okay, the police are checking? Good. Where else. She'd be at the school yard. Not hers, the one by our house. She goes there, she hangs out with her friends. They sit on the swings and they talk. There's also a Hot Topic where she goes to meet her girlfriends. Okay. We should call them, Rebecca, Renee and Miranda, they're Facebook friends. They post all the time. We should check her page and the "Pinkberry" two blocks from the school. You really know her schedule. Of course I do. She's my daughter. Listen, you both want to take care of Veronika, right? But there aren't two sides in this anymore. There's just a little girl. Lost in the city. Now I'm going to give this list to the officer in charge and you both are going to answer all of Officer Vandorn's questions. Do you understand? Yes. Do you understand? Yes. We're going to need that town car. Of course. Hello there. May I speak to Judge Nicastro's clerk please? He's having his gallbladder out. Is there somebody else I could talk to about a scheduling issue? What's the problem? No problem. Then why am I talking to you? Judge Nicastro? Yes? Well, hello there. I'm Leonardo Prince, Kate Reed's assistant. She wants an extension on the Sabbatino mediation. Judge, this is... It's serious. I mean, Kate holds you in the... Mr. Prince. Yes, your honor. Tell her to get it done. I will, sir. I called you three times. Justin, hi. You just dropped a bomb and then left. Well, you kind of made me tell you. Well, why is that, Kate? Why do I always have to make you tell me something that involves me, that changes my life? We just, we need to talk about this. Yes, I know, but I just, I can't right now. Look, the client that I'm with, his daughter ran away. And the police are now interviewing him and her grandmother. It's just always the case with you, always the case, huh? This is about a ten year old little girl. It wouldn't matter if it was a 30 year old elephant. Justin. It's a baby, Kate. It's our baby. It's a big deal. Look, I promise as soon as we find... Forget it. I'll call you. You had a business arrangement with Teddy? We grew up together. We had a friendship. And we did business together. In the neighborhood, there's no distinction. There is for me. That's because you're uptown. My husband was an honest man who held himself to the highest moral standards. I find it very hard to believe... What? That he would associate with me? That's not what I said. It was implied. You are painting a picture of a man I have never even met, who founded this firm on embezzled money, I mean... Where did you meet Teddy? At the opera. Teddy hated opera. Well, that's where you're wrong, actually. Teddy loved the opera, so much so that he was on the board. What Teddy loved, was being in a position of power. You loved Teddy, so did I. You trusted him, so did I. Even though, as you say, he withheld information at your trial, then sent you to jail for 12 years? This is ridiculous, none of this makes any sense. Look, I don't expect you to understand. And quite frankly, I don't care anymore. I came here to tell Kate that I was leaving town. Now you go ahead and file that notice of violation, or whatever the hell it is. I'm out of here. Well, actually no. You're not going anywhere. Pretty quick with the threats there, missy. Teddy's amendment to include you in the will was flagged at probate. Now, you can file a protest, but that will take years to resolve, so be prepared for some pretty major legal fees. Or, I can buy you out. I don't threaten. I act. You are... You are really... Yeah. I am. Nika! Veronika! Hold on, hold on. Is she all right? I need to talk to my daughter. Thank you for calling us. She's asking for you. For me? Yeah, come on. I'll be down here if you need me. Hi. I'm sorry I made trouble for everyone. Oh, honey, that's okay. Look, they were just scared, that's all. I know. Look, sometimes... Sometimes I run away from things, too. You do what you've got to do. Can you help me run away? Oh, Veronika. I didn't know how to say what I want to say. Yeah. The saying. Mmm. That's the tricky part. I love my grandmother and Pete. I love them both. That's a good thing, right? That's a really good thing. I don't want to have to choose. They're going to make me choose. Oh, honey. It's okay. Okay, you two, wait for me over there. And you, little lady, why don't you come with me? Leo, I'd like to introduce you to Veronika. Hello. Nice to meet you. Charmed. Leo's going to take very good care of you. Okay. Yeah. There's my desk. A lot of cool stuff on it. You can check it out. Oh, I won't touch anything. That's good, because a lot of it is irreplaceable... No, no, honey, you can touch whatever you want. You can play with these things. Nothing breaks, either, so just have fun. Go at it. Where are the Sabbatino brothers? Um, I sent them to the cleaners. Literally. No. No, no, no, no, no. Leo, I don't have time for any of this. I solved their problem. What? Yeah, it's done. You want your messages? You didn't drug them, did you? No, I almost had to drug myself, but then I remembered that my body is a temple. You solved their problem? They don't know it yet because they were too busy fighting. You tell them. I'm... I'm stunned. You mean, "I don't pay you enough. " You two, you two, come with me. What? You had no right! She would not run anywhere! She was happy! Are you crazy? She was running away from you! This has been a tough day. Nika was lost. You were upset, you both were upset. You blamed one another. Yeah, because she... He... I wasn't finished! But she's found. She's fine. Yet the two of you are still arguing. Think about that. Now I have some other business to attend to, so I don't have to mediate the two of you from jail. Stay here, calmly. I will be back in an hour and we will figure this out. We have to. Leo and his brother used to fight over dessert every night. So his father proposed a solution. One of them got to cut the dessert in half and the other one got to pick which piece, so, uh, Danny. Danny, yes, you... ...get to repaint the line and Ralph, you pick which spot. Okay. If it's on the left, you back in, on the right, you go straight in. Now you're both going to be coming out in the middle, so if one ofyou parks a little too close, you're both screwed. Fair? Fair. Fair. Excellent, I'll tell Judge Nicastro. Thank your highness, I mean, your honor. Well, I'm glad we got that settled. Me, too. Yes, this is she. The results, okay, yeah. I... Okay. Thank you. We have that every day. You're crazy. Every day, every day we eat the same thing. I don't want anything less than full custody. You are not her father. You tell me how I'm not her father. You tell me! You are not her blood! Really? You've been in this room since I left and you're at exactly the same place? Children are precious. We don't know how they'll enter our lives. We don't know how they'll leave our lives. You need to figure out how to share Veronika. Because if you don't, somebody else will. A judge, a social worker, a lawyer. Somebody who... ...who doesn't love Veronika. Somebody who has to guess what's best. But try to fit your precious, your distinctive Veronika to a template that's just a... It's a one-size fits all, is that what you want? No. Nobody does. But it happens. It happens all the time. We go to court because we can't or we won't figure out how to solve our own problems. If you love Veronika, then prove it. Just talk to each other. And if you can't figure out how to solve this, then neither of you deserve her. You... You really love Veronika? So do you. Kate. Not now, Lauren. Oh, yes. Now. Don't sit, this won't take long. I'm done with your petty crap. And I'm done with yours, so I guess I'll be leaving. Win-win. I'll tell you what I told your buddy, David Smith. Teddy's will has been flagged by probate. How did it end up in probate court? You and I have an equal share in this firm. No, wait, that's incorrect. I'm the managing partner, my share's weighted. Lauren, I don't have the time or the patience to put up with your... You're fired. What? Oh, now you have the time? You want an explanation? All right. Well, you're insubordinate, you're petty, you're always late, and you know what, Kate? I just don't like you. I'm the Reed of Reed & Reed. Don't go there, Kate. I've prepared for this moment. Did you? That's what I thought. You can't... Pack up your office. Lauren Reed. Joe, hi. Yes, good to hear from you, too. David Smith left you a note. Apparently, he's going somewhere. I need a minute. Kate... Hi. Justin's here. Hi. We are going to talk. We are going to figure out what to do. Okay. Yeah. Doctor called. Okay, and? When I told you before that I was pregnant, I'd only taken a home test. And... So I called the doctor just to be sure. I'm not pregnant. I don't... No, wait. Being in a relationship with you is... It's like Christmas morning. You know? And you're this kid and you run into this big, beautiful tree with all these presents underneath. But as soon as you get there, bombs start to drop. I wish. What? What, what do you wish? You wish it were different? You wouldn't be you. It's all tied together. That's life with Kate Reed. Christmas and bombs. Justin. Justin, wait. I thought you said you wanted to talk. Yeah, you know why I came here? I came here to say that we should stay married. Justin. I thought we were going to have a child, so it would have made sense to stay together. Right? And now? Kate, you have this passion for people and justice and life and that's amazing. You know and you're warm, and you're wonderful, and you're beautiful, and you're frustrating, and you're annoying, and you're a little crazy. I spend half of my time thinking about how much I love you and I spend the other halfwishing I'd never met you. Justin. Kate? I'm going home. Kate! I just wanted to thank you. You're a woman of your word. My bridge is still built. Yeah, well, you know. That's what I do. I build bridges. Thank you. What? Judge? The Sabbatino brothers, they're not coming in. You killed them.
