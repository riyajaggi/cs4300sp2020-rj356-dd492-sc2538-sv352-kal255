 Are you alone? No. Well, I'm meeting someone. Mmm. Oh. Well, that's just too bad. Why is that? Because we could have talked. We're talking now. And then, you could have bought me a drink. It's not too late. And who knows where it might have led? Marriage? Mr. Patrick, right this way.

 Our table's ready. This is a nice place. Yeah. It's fancy. Mmm-hmm. I thought we were just going to grab a quick bite. Thank you. Thanks. Enjoy. You don't remember. Remember what? It's the 19th. Okay. It's been six months since we filed for divorce. I just figured since we're signing papers tomorrow, we should go over the agreement. Right. Okay. That's a good idea. You know, if there's something you're not comfortable with, we can talk about it. Mmm-hmm. Discuss the...

 Hi. Can I get you started with something to drink? Nothing for me. Thanks. And for you, sir? Oh, yeah. It's weird hearing you speak Chinese. Mandarin. Right. It helps me service our clients who do business in the Far East. Ah. The Far East. Maybe you should open an office there. Did you call me in here just to show off your Chinese? Mandarin. Right. One of our clients, William Hemmond, has asked us to help a friend of his son's in a financial mediation. Okay. It's a credit dispute. Mmm. All right. Well, that sounds simple enough. Kate, Hemmond is a very important client. Reed & Reed has been representing his company for over 17 years. Simple is good. I like simple. I can handle simple. I've got too much complicated. Hi. I'm Kate Reed. Tim Hemmond. And this is... Claudia Evans. Glad to meet you. Oh, so good to meet you. We appreciate your time on this. Claudia's like a little sister to me. Sure. Why don't you guys have a seat? Thank you. So, tell me what's going on. I have this credit card and someone else is using it. Without your permission? Sort of. She wants to close the account, but she can't pay off the debt. Have you talked to her directly? Not exactly. It's complicated. I think it's important for you to know that Claudia served with me in Afghanistan. In fact, she did two tours. Which is impressive, but, uh, what are we talking about here? Is this credit card fraud or identity theft? Whatever you say here, stays here. Claudia, the whole mediation process, it's very confidential. Um... The Army knows me as Claudia Evans. And my friends know me as Claudia Evans. I have a credit card under the name Claudia Evans. But you're not Claudia Evans. My name is Sofia Pena. I joined the Army right after high school. This recruiter at a mall. He was talking about being a part of something bigger than myself. Something special. And for the first time, I felt I had a calling. But how does that lead to identity theft? I used a social security number I bought off the street to sign up. The guy told me she was dead, that it was a victimless crime. So, then, you switched names to enlist. You're not a U.S. citizen? My parents brought me here from Honduras when I was a baby. Growing up, I thought I was just a regular citizen, you know, an American. Like all the other kids. But one day, in civics class, I found out I wasn't. But you've lived here all your life. So, can't you apply? I'd have to leave the U.S. and go back to Honduras. With no guarantee she'd be approved or even get a visa to come back home. I became Claudia to be a soldier and serve my country. I never forgot that I was Sofia. It's just... When I came home, she didn't matter. Why would you say that? To get an apartment or a cell phone, you need credit. And a job history. Sofia Pena didn't have either. So, I got a credit card in Claudia's name. But Claudia Evans is still alive. And all that activity showed up on her credit report. I made a mistake. And I want to get things straight with Claudia Evans. I never meant to hurt her. Well, maybe we can work this out. With her, directly. Great. Whatever you say. I just need to keep this off of Immigration's radar. We need Reed & Reed to handle this quickly and quietly. Tim, this is not a simple financial dispute. I know. But you've got to handle it. Please. Why is this so important to you? Because your unit is your family. And we take care of our own. I command a support unit. Supply and logistics. Sofia's a driver. Last year, we were making a good will run, dropping medical gear and food to a village outside Kandahar. On the way back, our Humvee hit an IED. Hey! Hold on to me! I guess they didn't like the food. It does kind of suck. All right. Hold tight, okay? I'm calling for help. A QRF will be here in no time. All right? We're going to be okay. So, we've been through a lot together. And I feel responsible for her. I called Tim because I knew I could count on him. Can we count on you? Yes. Hey, Leo. See if you can get Claudia Evans on the phone for me, please. Courthouse records called. The David Smith case file is in a basement, they think. They think? It's 30 years old. I mean, hopefully, it's on paper and not papyrus. People vs. David Smith is there. It's ringing. Leonardo, do you know why I hold you in such high esteem? My sense of personal style? It's because you anticipate my needs without me actually having to say them. You need me to call you a cab. Nope. You need me to order you lunch. No. I leave my desk and calls don't get returned, invoices don't get paid, files go missing. The machine breaks down. My father left that man a quarter of his estate. And I don't know why. I may never know why. Unless you look for the answer. Ah, it's like we have a mind meld, you and I. Uh-huh. Oh, and nice personal style. Too late. Oh, and Justin called. Twice. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, is this Claudia Evans? Mr. Karros. Thank you so much for coming in. So, what didn't you want to tell me over the phone? Ah, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I spoke with the attorneys in Shenzhen this morning, and we have a new settlement offer. Finally. Did those bastards own up to what they took from me? No. Not exactly. So, we're stuck in the damn tunnel. They're offering $5 million paid out over the next three quarters. 15 cents on the dollar going forward. With no admission of guilt. You're joking. Those bastards stole my patent. Shut that plant down. Well, you know it doesn't quite work like that, Mr. Karros. Certainly not in China. I don't like it. Well, you don't have to. But you have to take it. We have been litigating this case for three years. It's a good deal. We're not going to get a better offer. Teddy promised me better. He most certainly did not. And if he were giving you this information, you would be over the moon. Now, would you like me to call and accept the offer, or do you need to find a new attorney and start from scratch? Ms. Evans, thank you so much for agreeing to participate in this mediation. You said on the phone this was about my credit report? That you could fix it? Yes. That's right. But, before we begin, I'd like to introduce you to Sofia Pena. Ma'am. Hello. I never even knew until last week that you were alive. What? I promise I will make this up to you. Okay? I'll pay any fees... Oh, my God. It's you... involved with fixing your credit. You stole my identity? Sofia used your social security number to enlist in the military. Which I know has created enormous problems for you. I have been living a nightmare. I'm sure you have. And we kind of have a plan to fix it. She's going to pay off your credit card and all your banking fees. And everything that was opened in your name will be closed. I was denied a home loan. After years of saving, I lost my chance to buy a house. I am so sorry. It was humiliating. I mean, I'm standing there, screaming, "That's not me," but they don't listen. Claudia, that must have been horrible for you. But right now, let's just stay focused on the solution. Because this plan right here, it serves everyone. Oh, really? Does it put her in jail? It's unlikely that criminal charges would be brought up against Sofia. Are you freaking kidding? Immigration and Customs would take precedence. She's not legal? If Immigration takes over, there is a possibility that Sofia could be deported. Which would be very bad for you because then she wouldn't be able to pay you back. You have my word that I will set things right. Tell that to the authorities. Ms. Evans. Wait. Wait. Claudia, if you could... I never saw that coming. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I... I'm so sorry. You know what? This is not over. All right? This is not over. I take back the compliment on your personal style. Do you know the difference between a black widow and a brown recluse? Because I do. This is about the David Smith file? Everything pre-1990 is in a deep, dark, dangerous basement. Well, it sounds like it should be fun for you. Like those video games you like, where all those creepy crawlers come... No. No, no, no, no, no. These spiders are real. Very real. So, then, you don't have the file. I have bites inside my ear. You're better than that, Leo. I'm not. Really. Kate Reed's office. Hold, please. Find a way. It's important. The venom of a brown recluse... Mmm-hmm. ...is so toxic that... Leo big. Spider small. Yeah. I know. That's how they get in your ear. Good. Well, make sure you rinse. This is Kate. They served me with a notice from Homeland Security. What? They're going to deport me. Can you give me the case number? And the name of the attorney in charge? What are you going to do? My job. The attorney is, uh, Paul Hainsley. Mr. Hainsley. Hi. Who are you? My name is Kate Reed. I was at your office. I must have just missed you. Ms. Reed, I got your messages. All six of them. And now, we're talking. So, you don't have to call me back. How great is that? Yeah, I've got a deposition and then a hearing to get to. Okay, just one minute. No. Great, then I'll spend the next five minutes convincing you to give me one minute. You've got from here until I get to my car. Deal. Walk slower. What do you want? Okay, so, my client, Sofia Pena, a former soldier. You've been assigned her case. Yeah? What can we do to resolve her situation? You're an immigration lawyer, you should know the law is pretty clear. Actually, sir, I'm a mediator. So, then, why are you... And about the I.D. theft? There are extenuating circumstances. Doesn't matter. She's illegal. I understand that. But, I'm wondering if... She's illegal. She's got to go. But she was a soldier. I mean, that should count for something. Ms. Reed. There is nothing for you to mediate. Your client got her Notice to Appear. Make sure she shows up or I'll have her arrested. Hey. You sound sick. I'm not. Hung over? Oh, I wish. Why are you breathing heavy? It's too early for that kind of call. No, I was just running. I hate you. So, listen. You didn't call me back yesterday. I know, I spent all day chasing a DHS lawyer. Those are some pretty serious dudes. They can play rough. Yeah. Paul Hainsley, he wants to deport my client. Yeah, I know Hainsley. He can be a hard-ass. And he's railroading her. You know, he doesn't even see her as a real person. Well, just between you and me, when the DA needed help with his nanny's papers, the guy played ball. Really? Yeah. Huh. Listen, the reason I was calling is... I just wanted to apologize for the other night. Oh, Justin. It was me who walked out on you. You did, yeah. But dinner was my idea. It just wasn't the right way to deal with, you know, what we're dealing with. Well, I don't know. I just don't want to talk about the divorce. Okay. But I think, at some point, you know... You know, I'm really glad that we're still friends. Yeah. Me, too. Listen. I'll talk to you later, okay? Okay. Bye. Todd. I filed a motion to dismiss on the Rutledge case. It was denied. That's no surprise. Well, I figured it was worth a shot. I mean, now, maybe we can move forward with... What? You just keep taking shots and hope for the best? Um... File a continuance. You're a good lawyer, Todd. You're just in over your head. Hold down the fort until we can get you some back-up. All right. Jolene? I am so sorry, Lauren. I'll have the Garza deposition highlighted by the end of the day. My kid's sick. He was throwing up all night. Too much information? I just wanted you to get the door. Oh. I hear the rumors. The chatter. Reed & Reed could go under. Or we could merge. Or be bought out. I know full well that a cloud of uncertainty is hanging over the future of this firm. It's caused some people to jump ship. So, I am damn proud to announce that we have finally settled the Hang Seng patent suit, the largest of Teddy's outstanding litigations. And as a thank you to all ofyou, Christmas will be coming early this year. You're all getting bonuses. The staff meeting is adjourned. Okay. Great work. Thank you. It's a great win. So, I spoke to this immigration lawyer, and he says... I can't afford a lawyer. I mean, I'm already selling everything I've got to pay off Claudia Evans. And I'm moving in with my boyfriend. Wait. If I marry her, would that help? Jeff. Why not? Hey, I love you. Unfortunately, it just... It doesn't work like that. Sofia, do you have any relatives here? We could file for hardship. No. It's just me. Well, what about asking Tim if his dad can give you a job? Get you a work visa. Well, she'd have to go to Honduras to qualify. Maybe after I drop this stuff off, I'll just keep going. You can't run from this, Sofia. You know what's funny? My parents hated when I spoke Spanish. I mean, they didn't even want me listening to Gloria Estefan. I was their All-American girl. That's why they sacrificed. That's why they were always tired and hungry and poor. But, that was okay, because their daughter was an American. There's nothing for me in Honduras. My parents passed away. My relatives are gone. I'd be more at home at a base in Afghanistan. All right. I wish there was another way. But there's not. Meet me at the DHS office. I will walk you in. It will look good for your case. Really? Yes. We'll get a hearing on the calendar. You'll resolve the issue with Claudia. When you step in front of that judge, all he is going to see is an upstanding young woman. Yeah, but the rules will still be against me. You are the kind of person who does the right thing. Don't change now. I'll see you there. Are you lost? Yesterday, you missed the staff meeting. I thought it was optional. No, you didn't. You're sitting in my seat. Oh, this is not your seat. No. This is the property of Reed & Reed. You simply rent it. Oh, God, Kate. How is the Hemmond case coming along, by the way? It's coming. I thought it was a simple financial thing. Well, as it turns out, it is less of a financial thing and more of an immigration thing. Well, last year, Teddy and I helped several clients with visa problems. This is different. With Immigration, it is not about the cards you're dealt, but how you play them. You have to be aggressive. Use anything and everything you've got. If you have even the tiniest advantage, use it. Okay. Yeah, I'll remember that. Thank you. Yeah. Leo. You're here. Yes. So, then, you have the David Smith file. No. Ugh. That personal style thing will only get you so far. I'm looking for it as we speak. I sub-contracted the job to a specialist. What does that mean? You want results. You'll get them. You hired somebody else to look for the file? I sub-contract all the time. I am part of a giant network of specialized sub-contractors. And what's your specialty? Delegating. Ah. You made it. Yeah. Okay, I'm scared. I mean, I've seen some things in my life. But right now, I'm really scared. Sofia, I understand. And I know that this may feel like a step in the wrong direction, but it's really the only way to get what you want. Okay. Let's do it. Okay. Go ahead. Hello. Uh, my client, Sofia Pena, has received a Notice to Appear. Can you direct us to the clerk's office so we can set a court date? Backup to the lobby. Copy that. Sofia Pena, I need you to place your hands behind your head, interlock your fingers, and slowly get down on the ground. Oh, okay. Wait. No, no, no. No. I'm sorry. Uh, we're just here to set a court date. That's it. Ms. Pena. Now. What the hell is going on here? DHS has determined that she's a flight risk and ordered her detained. A flight risk? Are you kidding me? She's here. She didn't run. All right. Let's go. Who issued this order? I want to know. You'll have to check that on the website after she's been processed. All right. All right. Look. Sofia? Sofia. I promise, I'll figure this out. Okay? I need you to step back. Sofia, I promise you. I will fix this. I need you to step back. Now. You said this was her best shot. And I thought it was. But the arrest warrant was issued by ICE after they sent the Notice to Appear. We were talking about moving in together. Now, Sofia's locked up in a cell. Jeff, I wish I could fix that. I really do. But I can't. Not right away. You don't understand. Okay, a detention center is no place for her. I don't know if she can handle it. She's been back two months. But some nights... It's like she never came home. Sofia. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Everything is fine. You're safe. Yeah. Would it help if you talked about it? You need to get her out of there. Well, she'll get a hearing. And the DHS will make its case as to why she should be deported. And we will get a chance to say why she should stay. What can I do? Gather everything you can on Sofia. Military records, school records. Make a list of people that could serve as character witnesses. Okay. And in the meantime, you have me. Kate. Kate. Cyrus here, found the David Smith case file. Oh, and this was messengered from DHS. Mmm, she's a close approximation to what you described. She'll do. What? What am I going to do? Excellent. I will be in touch and I will mark it in the calendar. A pleasure bartering with you, Leonardo. What's going on? Cyrus has a unique talent for finding things, but lacks social skills. Why was he looking at me like that? Well, you see, Kate, long before man invented currency, he exchanged goods and services. Leonardo Prince. What? You wanted the file. Cyrus could find it. No. Money was no interest to him. No. It's just coffee. And it can happen anytime in the next three years. Don't worry. He'll forget. Oh, I doubt it. Where do you want this file? Right there, so you can read it. Me? Yeah. It's gigantic. Okay, then, I'll read it. And you can research immigration law. You know what? I can't. Because I am reading the David Smith case file. Yep. And to do both would be a fundamental violation of the laws... Find Paul Hainsley for me. Nine months. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you later. Sofia's hearing isn't for nine months? She'll be locked up the entire time. See you, Jim. You are borderline stalking me. Criminals don't get prison sentences that are that long. The immigration system moves slowly. What can I say? It isn't right. Sofia Pena broke the rules. She's got to wait in line like everybody else. She was a soldier. She risked her life for this country. All illegals are equal in the eyes of the law. That's not true now, is it? Look. Ifyou want to debate the finer points... Two years ago... ...of immigration law... you expedited a hearing for a British woman, Maggie Harper, when her tourist visa expired. I vaguely recall that case. Different circumstances. Yeah, clearly. Because she got a green card. Quickly. What are you implying? That when you're the DA's nanny, you're more equal than the others. What do you want? Expedite Sofia's hearing. I'll see what I can do. Anything interesting so far? I'm not sure. What do you mean? That there is a lack of certainty. I'm not a lawyer, so I don't want to give you bad information. So, then, you found something? David Smith was a financial manager. He was on trial for embezzling money from his clients. A lot of money. Right. I know that. According to this transcript, the reason that he went down was because your father made a mistake. Justin. I just got an earful from Paul Hainsley. I told you what I knew about the DA's nanny in confidence. I can't believe you would use that to leverage him. But you said it yourself that he is a hard-ass. I mean, I didn't have a choice. No, you always have a choice. You just chose to get what you wanted at my expense. You have no boundaries, Kate. And you never think about how the things you do affect the other people in your life. Look, I did what I had to do to help my client, Justin. Of course you did. Because your clients are always more important than the rest of us. Especially me. All right. Why don't we meet up later and we can just talk about this? Let's not. Leo. Leo. Good morning, Sunshine. Oh. What time is it? Coffee time. Oh. I pulled an all-nighter. Technically, you were asleep when I walked in, so... I saw the sun come up. You know what? It's not a time to quibble. And I get mad when I don't have my coffee. Which is why I'm getting it. You're the best. I'm going back to work. Kate Reed's office. Congratulations. Ms. Pena's hearing has been expedited. Fantastic. Thank you. Yeah, well, it promises to be the last time I see you. So, I was inspired. You're too kind. How far down the calendar am I looking here? Are we talking days? Weeks? Even better. We're going to be in court this afternoon. But that's not enough time to prepare. Well, you wanted special treatment. You got it. I'll see you in court. Leo! That means "Hello. Good morning. " In Mandarin. I know. Why am I here? I bet that's what you're wondering. And I'm going to tell you. Oh, awesome, as you might say. Um... I need your, how do you say, help. Well, our timetable has changed, and... Anyway, coming to you is definitely a last resort. Yeah, that's a strange way to ask for my help, Kate. It's the case that the Hemmonds brought in. What's gone wrong? A lot. The client's in detention. And in a few hours, she'll go to an immigration hearing. After which, she could be deported. Okay. What do you need me to do? I need you to go to the hearing and buy me as much time as you can. Okay. I can give you that. Great. Thank you so much, Lauren. But, I will need something in return. Like what? Tell me what you've found on David Smith. Don't blame Leonardo. His friend, Cyrus, told me. He would have given over nuclear launch codes if he talked to me for another minute. According to the transcript, Smith was cooperating with the authorities. But then, Dad failed to produce key evidence. Teddy refused. No. He said he lost it. But the judge didn't believe him. So, then, what could have been just a slap on the wrist for Smith ended up becoming hard time. You're saying that Teddy gave this man a quarter of everything he had because of a mistake? It cost him 12 years of his life. The hearing is in a few hours. I'll see you in court. Tim. Tim. Hi. Kate. I tried calling you. But, uh... Where are you going? I have to report. My unit's headed back to Kabul. Oh. Did you get Sofia out of detention? Well, she's in immigration court right now. And I'm just not convinced that a judge will be swayed on Sofia's merit alone. The decision could go either way. Tim, is there anything that you can tell me that can just tip the balance in her favor? Why ask me? Because I called every soldier in your unit, and they all said I should. What are you holding back? One's measure should not be taken by lineage, or where on a map they were born. Actions speak loudly. A person is defined by what they do. Counselor, proceed to make a point, or just proceed to the end, or just... Let's get on with this. When all the facts have been presented, Your Honor, there will be no doubt in your mind that Sofia Pena belongs here and nowhere else. Where's Kate? I don't know. Moving right along here. Mmm-hmm. All right. Mr. Hainsley? Your filing stands? Yes, Your Honor. We're seeking immediate removal. Your Honor? Yes, Counselor? I would like to request that the motion to remove be read in full into the record. Ahh, we don't usually do that. My client has a right to hear the motion. In full. You're not here to make any friends, are you, Ms. Reed? So sorry we're late, Your Honor. Order, please. Your Honor, we'll waive the right to hear the motion read into the record. Hey, I like it. Let's make a plan and stick to it. Hey. New witness. I'd like to call a character witness to the stand. Warrant Officer Tim Hemmond. Your Honor, this witness has already submitted a written statement. This is just another pointless delay. No. New info. This witness has new information, Your Honor. All right, then. I'll allow it. Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? I do. Counselor. State your name, please. Warrant Officer Tim Hemmond, United States Army. And what is your relationship to Sofia Pena? She served in my support unit in Afghanistan. Medal. Hey. I have had just about enough. Ask him about the medal. You keep it up, and I will hold you both in contempt. Yes, sir. Mr. Hemmond. Could you tell us the story behind your medal, please? Sofia and I were on our way back to camp from a remote village. We were the last vehicle in our convoy. And we tripped an IED. Tim. Tim. Come on. We've got to get out of here. Hang onto me, Tim. Tim. Tim. You with me? I guess they didn't like the food. Yeah, well, it does kind of suck. You're hurt. Uh, I'll be okay. All right. I'm going to call, a QRF will be here in no time. Okay? Good. Headquarters. Now, an incident like that triggers an investigation. Sofia knew that saving the life of her superior officer would draw a lot of attention to herself. And any publicity might lead the Army to discover the fact that she was illegal. So, we agreed to tell a story that would shine the spotlight somewhere else. I accepted this medal in her honor. And not a day goes by where I don't think about the courage she showed that day. This is where this medal belongs. Thank you for my life. Your Honor? She is everything we fight for and everything we stand for. If she doesn't belong in this country, none of us do. Thank you, Mr. Hemmond. You're excused. Your Honor, as compelling as Ms. Pena's personal story may be, it does not change the facts of this case. She was not born in the United States. She has not applied for residency or citizenship. Section 329 of the INA states that any person who serves honorably in the armed forces during a time of conflict is eligible to apply for citizenship. Ifyou apply under your own name, and ifyou show a year of good moral character. I.D. theft exemplifies quite the opposite. I think saving a man's life speaks for itself. All right. That's enough. That's enough. Ms. Pena. You don't make this decision very easy. As Mr. Hemmond attests, you are owed a debt of gratitude for your exemplary service. But from the state's perspective, you've also transgressed. So... I... Who are you and what do you want? My name is Kate Reed, and I'm here to find a way to make sure everybody wins. Ah. I see. Well, you know, since you seem to be the one pulling the strings... Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Wow me. Well, working with Sofia, sir, I have taken steps to rescind all infringements on Claudia Evans' identity. Further, Tim has volunteered to take up a collection from Sofia's unit that will cover the debt and compensate Ms. Evans. You're saying the identity theft can be erased and all the money paid back, with interest. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Ms. Pena? Anything you'd like to say? Um... Sir. I made a foolish choice. I regret it, and I will never let it happen again. All I ask is that you see me for who I really am. It is clear to me that, as a teenager, you made a wrong decision for the right reasons. And I believe that your remorse is sincere, as is your willingness to make up for your misstep. So, Ms. Pena, I will end removal proceedings and grant you relief, contingent upon your completion of the terms of reparation outlined by Ms. Reed. Sorry, sir. Uh, this Ms. Reed? Do what she says... Yes, sir. ...and you get to stay. Once financial amends are made, I will allow you to file for citizenship using your own name. And it is my ruling that you have well earned that opportunity. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. Congratulations. I don't know how to thank you guys. Thank you both so much. You know what? Go celebrate. We still have some work to do. So, congratulations. Sofia. Oh, wait. Wait. Don't forget this. Thank you. Yep. Counselor. Uh, Lauren... Thank you. You were very good. And you were very Kate. Hey. I tried calling you. But you didn't answer your phone. That's because I didn't want to talk to anybody. I'm really sorry I betrayed your confidence. So, you just apologize and everything is all right? Justin, it's me we're talking about. God. You're unbelievable. You know that? Aw, Justin, I'm sorry. But don't hold this over my head just to get even. This isn't about getting even. This isn't about Paul Hainsley. And you know it. All right, fine. I admit it. I've been avoiding signing the divorce papers. But it's... It's only because I really like things the way they are. What we have is not a marriage, Kate. I know. And isn't that great? How is that great? Well, when we were "married" married, we never had any time for each other, right? And that created pressure. Right. Which I was willing to work through. You weren't. We have everything I loved about the relationship without actually having to be in the relationship. Mmm-hmm. So, it's all the fun without the work, right? Yes. And what's wrong with that? Where do I start? Hmm. Stop. What's wrong? This is what we always do. Yeah, and there's good reasons why we should. No, no, no. And then, it just goes back to the way it was before, and nothing changes. And I don't want to do this anymore, Kate. I can't. Sure, you can. No, I can't. What if you were mediating this relationship? Hmm? What would you say? Ignore the problems. Go to bed. No. You'd say fix it. Right? Maybe. Yeah. I love you, Kate. I do. But what we have is broken. And we can't keep pretending that it's not. Justin. No. I'm just... I'm sorry.
