 Fairly Legal (2011â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 1 - Pilot - full transcript 
 Although her dad, a leading law firm's founder, recently died, Kate Reed's hard to please stepmother prods her mercilessly to keep up the pace in her extraordinary section, out of court arbitration. Kate's ex, public prosecutor Justin Patrick, is crucial in obtaining information, which she handles with conscience, trying to do right for tycoon client Charles Pease and the innocent good son in the car that hit his succession-destined son Doug's. The unexpected full truth proves surprisingly relevant to all. Judge David Nicastro exacts revenge on her by simultaneously imposing a rather absurd pro bono mediation with a 24 hour deadline.

 Hey, what time is it? Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no. You're not supposed to be here. Oh, that's not the deal. - Come on, K, we don't have a deal. - We have a deal. We most definitely have a deal. - There is no sex, ever. - Oh, come on. And though we do have sex doesn't spend the night. All right, you know what? As much as I'd love to stay and discuss the final points of our deal, I have to go.  I have a huge meeting. - Hey, have a great first day back. - I hate you.

 I'll call you. Oh, you're such a lawyer. Sorry. Didn't want to sneak in unnoticed. Mission accomplished. Hi! Can I help you with something? Is that your boat in slip 41? It is now. It was my dad's, Terry Reed. Did you know him? - My wife and I, we're new here. - Oh, yeah? Sorry. Well, even if you weren't, you know, he didn't sail it very often. If you don't wanna give people a wrong  impression, you really should change the name. What's the bad luck to change the boat's name?

 Bitch. - Did you just call me...? - Anyway, I like it. You know, it was my idea. He was lonely, and then he met somebody, and then the boat was lonely. So... Anyway, have a good day! Welcome aboard. Hey, Spencer. Lauren's been trying to call you all morning. Really? I just turned my phone on. Kate, if she's called me, she's probably called you at least 10 times. You know, what if there is an emergency? I'm a mediator, I don't have emergencies. At least, not professionally. Look, she's calling me again on the other line. Could you, please, call her back? She's a bit obsessive, our stepmother, don't you think? That's what dad loved. - I thought it was her ass. - That, too. I'll just give her some time. It's only been a week. Now, what about you? Are you sure about going back to work already? Well, I kinda owe it to dad. You know, it's his firm, but it's your life. Yeah, but those things are really connected. Look, I gotta go to Debbie's crime. Good luck today. - All right. - Don't forget to call Lauren. - Oh, you know me. Hi. - Hi. - Coffee, black, please. - Sure. - Gimme the money. - Okay. Gimme the money! Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on! Screw you, pal! Screw me? Screw you! Okay. Hold on a second. Just take it easy. Take it easy. Just put the gun down, 'cause you don't wanna hurt anybody, all right? How's that coffee comin' along? Um...You seem like the kinda guy who knows what he's doing. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so, uh... We're not gonna have any problems here, right? Yeah. No. Right. Okay, good. So just tuck the gun back under your shirt, 'cause you don't want someone to walk by, and then they see you and... Right? How we doing on that coffee? Good. Now, educate me. What do you get when you rob a store? You...You know, money. Right. How much? Gimme a number. - 500 bucks? - Yeah, right! 5... Forget it, man! Let's just say 100. All right? You get shot... The emergency room is gonna cost you a grand. So just give the guy 100 bucks. - I'm gonna give him something. - Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. Hold on, hold on. What are you gonna buy with the money? Beer. And, uh... beef jerky. Beer and jerky. Nice. That's a balanced meal. So how much does... Let's say 50 bucks of beer and jerky cost you? - 17.50. - 7... 17.50? Are you kidding me? - Who's robbing who? - Hey, come on! All right, fine, fine, fine. So how does 50 bucks of beer and jerky sound to you? I mean, I assume you're gonna be running, right? - So that's all you can carry. - That's... Yeah, okay. Okay, good. So... 17.50 wholesale... And we go on with our day. - Yeah. - Yes? And my coffee, right? You're gonna get my coffee. - Yeah, yeah. - Great. Okay, good. Black. Okay. There you go. And, uh... How 'bout this? Good. Okay? - Ha ha! - All right. You're welcome. Hey, hey, hey, that... that's 5.75. For coffee and a cookie? Those are organic. - Spencer. - Did you call Lauren? - Nope. I got held up. - Kate... - Gotta go. Love you! - Kate! Ah...Leo, my Leo. Good morning. Welcome back. You look great. Oh, what can I say? Grief suits me. Yeah. Oh, you should try this. It's apple chai tea infusion. Eew. I hate those girly drinks, Leo. Your loss. It's appletastic. Uh, Judge Nicastro's office called. You're expected in his court at 11:30. - He's got a case for you. - Doesn't Judge Nicastro know I'm not a practicing attorney anymore? It's a mediation. You were specifically requested. Okay, that's weird. He hates me. Yes. Yes, he does. You're supposed to say, "No, he doesn't, he loves you." - Any other calls? - Lauren. That bitch just can't help herself. - I mean, it's my first day back. - Kate. My father is not even cold in the ground. - We can't all be obsessive-compulsive... - Kate! - Anal retentive... - Ah! She's right behind me, isn't she? Kate. I need you. Now. Yes. Right. I was just going over my schedule here with Leonardo. - You need me back... - ASAP. S-a-p. You have a tendency to panic. You have a tendency not to. Um, now that dad's gone, are you still my evil stepmother or just the evil managing partner? Have you been to Masa's lately? - What? - Boulevard. Aqua. Gary Danko. No. I haven't done much dining out lately. I've been mourning the death of my father. You? Hey. I miss my husband. Every minute. But instead of sulking, I am trying to protect the firm he loved. By running up your expense account? Oh, grow up, Kate. Every law firm in San Francisco is wining and dining our clients, telling them to jump ship... and it's working. Ortho West left for Morrison Foerster, the Rixton Group for Wilson Sonsini, and Tinker Connelly, Third Pallbearer, right side, dropped us the day... Of the funeral. I called his son from the limo and over drinks at the Morgan tonight, I will get that business back. Teddy Reed is dead. Reed & Reed is on life support. I will do whatever it takes to keep it alive. What can I do? You know Charles and Douglas Pease. Yeah, sure. Pease, inc. Women's clothing. They're a big client. Well, as you know, they've agreed to be bought out by a Canadian company. Douglas will be in charge. His father retires with a generous severance. So what's the problem? Well, they were supposed to sign the contracts today, but the old man called me this morning and tried to back out. No deal for them, no fees for us. Now, I convinced Charles to come in and talk it out with Douglas, but we need those contracts signed. Get them on the same page. That's what I do. Pastels. Primaries. Stripes. Solids. - You have no idea, do you? - That's not the point, is it? - Gentlemen... - You don't know what to think unless somebody graphs it for you. - Gentlemen... - Are you gonna run the company? No. You're gonna let bean counters... Gentlemen... You know Kate Reed. Hey, Charlie, Doug. I'm sorry about your father. He was a good man. I'll miss him. Thank you. - I'll miss him too. - Thank you so much, Doug. That's my boy. Never an original thought. Since we seem to be at an impasse, I thought it might be helpful if Kate got involved. We don't need a mediator. Thanks anyway, Kate. - I've made my decision. - Right. I've heard. It took 14 months to put this deal together. He was with it every step of the way. This is his deal, and he won't sign it. Well, he doesn't have to if he doesn't want to. - That's not... - But...Do you mind just telling me, Charlie, because this is so not like you: What's the story? Where's your head at? Spring 1993. I ordered Capri pants. Everyone else... the Gap, the Limited... They're all thinking bells. I cleaned their clocks. All of them. That was a fantastic time, Charles. What has that got to do with... The business is not in your blood. You don't feel it. I built the company on instinct, intuition. And that's your strength, Charlie. And I'm sure that Doug has his own. I have my MBA from Stanford. I make decisions based on statistical analysis, - trend-spotting. - Pie charts. We've had ten consecutive losing quarters. We blame the economy, and so far everyone believes us. But it's been a long time, dad, - since you've cleaned anyone's clock. - Okay okay, clearly you two approach things differently, but here's the part that I don't understand. That was true 14 months ago when you started negotiating this buyout. It was true a week ago, and it was true yesterday. So what changed? - Tell her about last night. - It has nothing to do with... - It's about judgment, Douglas. - Please, dad. Okay, hold on. Hold on, Charlie. What happened? I was coming home from dinner with clients. I was on the 280 heading south. I'd just got on the bridge. A red sedan crossed over the line and bumped me. What the hell? Whatcha gonna say now? Whatcha gotta say? I don't remember the impact. It was instinct, you know, turning away from the gun. I didn't...See them at all. - It just happened so fast. - Did anyone I.D. the sedan? Well, a good samaritan called it in, and there's a second witness. The driver and gunman are in custody. Now, if we go through this buyout... We have to disclose the details of any pending legal action. Well, someone pointed a gun at him. - He's blameless. - He was drunk. Douglas had a blood alcohol level that was elevated. - .09. - Drunk. I had two glasses of wine. That's not why I crashed. The courts aren't gonna see it that way. - Of course they're not. - And that's exactly why you don't want this to go to court. So how do we put these thugs in jail and clean up Doug's mess? Charlie, I was an attorney for five years. I quit to become a mediator. You wanna know why? In court, somebody wins, but there's always a loser. And it doesn't necessarily have to do with who's right and who's wrong. Now, if we go to court, this is gonna limp through the system for 18 months and all the while, Doug's DUI is gonna become public record, which is exactly what you don't want. I'm not just gonna stand by and do nothing. Okay, the kids in the car... that's an open and shut case. The system's gonna take care of them. They'll probably be offered some kind of plea bargain. Our only concern is Doug's DUI. We handle that, the deal can move forward, right? Absolutely. Charles? Great. So we're all back on the same page. Win-win. And you know what? Kate has a unique connection to the D.A.'S office. I am sure she'd be happy to use it. Especially for such important clients like you. Lauren, may I have a word with you, please? Excuse us, gentlemen. My father would never ask me to do this. No, you're right. He wouldn't. He'd ask me to ask you. It's business, Kate. We use what we have. Our clients can go anywhere for legal services. Hell, they can get half of what they need off the Internet. They come to us for our connections. You have one. We're using it. Just do something with my father's ashes. - Coffee. Black, three sugars. - You're forgiven. - Where ya goin'? - Hell. He wasn't driving erratically or over the speed limit. In fact, the legality of a sobriety test, given the circumstances, is questionable at best. - You missed me. - That's not why I'm here. Well, you could have called. - Lauren asked me to... - Yeah, I know. But you could have called. Instead, you came over. Because it's important. Because you feel guilty about last night. Why would I feel guilty about last night? Oh, you're saying you're not here because you feel guilty? Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. - So you miss me. - You're such a dick. All right. You're gonna like this. Your gunman's got an extensive record. Pointing a firearm at another driver from a moving vehicle's a class a felony. - He's gonna do ten years. - Can I see? No, no, no. Ha. Attorneys only. Sorry. The driver's also looking at ten reducible to five. Well, those are stiff sentences. - My client will be happy. - Pretty standard stuff, actually. There's the possibility of catastrophic loss of life. The vehicle itself is a weapon. The gun compounds the threat. The law was designed to keep gangbangers from taking their beefs on the road. And what about my guy's DUI? Well...He's got no priors. Given the circumstances, a good lawyer should get it thrown out. Let's assume he has a good lawyer. Ha. Cute. Okay. We're done. This wasn't just business, was it, huh? Come on, be honest, Kate. This was about us. Justin... I'm always honest. It's my greatest flaw. Well, it's one of them. Yeah. Remind me again why our marriage didn't work. Ah. Just did. I was joking, Kate. I was kidding. Kate. I was kidding. Wait. Okay, I get it. You're angry. I'm sorry. This looks familiar. I apologize. - Not accepted. Nope. - I'm sorry, Kate. I apologize. Really familiar. Could you get her on the phone, please? Talk to me, Leo. Hey, don't be late for Judge Nicastro. - He hates to be kept waiting. - Oh, give me a little credit. We'll get right outside of his courtroom. Taxi! [] Sorry! I'm sorry. Judge, I am so sorry. Really sorry about this. No, you're not. You're Kate Reed. You have nothing but disdain for the law. Okay, well, that's not entirely true, sir. - You quit the profession. - I'm still in the system. It's just a... different part. Ha ha. - Mr. Brian Michaels... - Yes, sir. Is suing the three parties involved in his meticulously planned marriage proposal. The proposal went awry, and his grandmother's wedding ring, appraised at $11,500, was lost. So Mr. Michaels is requesting of one unemployed actor, one singing waiter, and one cupcake maker... Damages totaling... $10 million. Really, Mr. Michaels? Yeah. I just want what's fair. - So do we, your honor! - Your honor, I have... Now, as much as I would love to have this case in my courtroom, I thought that it might be better served elsewhere. So... Sit down. So we're going to try something a little different... Alternative dispute resolution, also known as mediation. Bailiff. - Kate Reed is not... - Thanks. A lawyer. She is a mediator. A mediator is kind of a referee in a game with no rules, except those agreed to by the parties involved. Ms. Reed handles all sorts of disputes, some even bigger than yours. Earlier this year, she was called in by the United Nations to settle a border dispute between Colombia and...Paraguay. Colombia and Nicaragua, sir. And it was their embassies here in San Francisco. They border each other on Market Street, and they share a common wall. But the U.N. did call. - They did call. - Ms. Reed. - Yes, sir. - Find a way to keep this case out of my court. - Okay. - You've got two days. Two days? Judge...There are three defendants, and this guy's asking for $10 million. Two days doesn't seem exactly... Okay. How about tomorrow morning at 9:00? Would you like to try for later on this afternoon? - No. - Find a resolution or you will be sent to prison for contempt of court. Yes, I can do that. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yes, sir. Bailiff, call the next case. Kate Reed's office. Judge Nicastro really does hate me. No, he doesn't. He loves you. That's right. I forgot. Okay, so why does he hate me? Well... there's the Fineman debacle. - Yes. Right. - And the examiner interview. - Okay. That was bad. - And the joke you made about his wife and the horse that his wife overheard. So you're saying it's not random. Oh. I never said that. I like you more every day, Leo. Okay, um...The complainants that Nicastro dumped on me will be there at 2:00, so...Set 'em up for me in the conference room. Done. What about the Pease case? Solved. I'm amazing. I'll be back in 20. Next. Hey. Wake up. - Where is he? - Out. - Lunch. - That son of a bitch! - Did you not read the file? - Which file, Kate? The file you couldn't possibly have read because I didn't give it to you? The file that would be illegal for you to have in your possession. Justin, Justin, the driver! The driver! Look, I'm in a meeting, Kate. I'm gonna have to call you back. Sorry. Hi... - How'd you know where I was? - It's Monday. He'll have a polish with onions and a peach Snapple. - This kid is going to Yale. - I'm sorry. Isn't this the same kid you just asked me to put in jail? Yeah. But that was before I knew the full story. Thank you. - Justin. Don't do this! - It's my heart. - You don't have a heart! - Hey, hey, hey! - God! Read the damn file! - Hey, I wrote the file! And if you read it, that's a crime. I'm gonna go talk to those kids. Taxi! Go ahead. What do you think they're gonna say, huh? They're gonna say what they always say... "I'm innocent." I did you a favor. You asked me to do this. Certain things have been put in motion... Hey, Kate! Sir, can you put your arms out? Thank you. - I'm guilty. - You realize that means... - I'll do the time. - D'Sean, this is a class "A" felony. Nah. Gun wasn't loaded. It doesn't matter if the gun was chocolate. You were in a moving vehicle. You threatened another driver. The D.A.'S gonna offer you ten years. I woulda pulled the trigger if I knew that. And ten years for Nathan. Well. He might only have to do five. For what? He was driving. He's an accessory. No... Nathan didn't do nothing, he... my cousin... - My cousin, he's... - I know, but listen to me. - He's clean. - Listen to me. - It doesn't work like that. - Let me do his time. He doesn't have to go down for what I did. The courts are not gonna let you do that. Give it to me! He didn't do nothin'! He didn't do nothin'! He didn't do nothin'! Say it! Say he's innocent! He didn't do nothin'! He's innocent! That's my homie! You wanna take him away? That's my boy! "National Honor Society. "Big Brother. All-State Marching Band." Wow. You're an impressive kid, Nathan. Tell me what happened. We were heading home. Just...Driving. Listening to the radio. And all of a sudden... Ha ha ha... yeah, whatever. What's up? Don't y'all know how to drive? What are you doing, man? He took his piece out. - You don't know how to drive? - Yo, D'Sean! - Yo, man...Yo, relax! - It's on, man! No! We gonna get pinched! He wasn't gonna shoot or anything, he just... That's just D'Sean. - Chill! It's all right! - No, man! The lady in the car, she saw the gun, I think, and freaked. You said there was a woman driving the car? - Yes. - Did you see a man in the passenger seat or in the back? I barely saw her. Okay. Why did D'Sean have a gun? Everyone I know's got a gun. 'cept me. I'm the good boy. So what kind of time am I facing? Ten years. Five if you plea out of it. Or you could insist that you go to trial. Um, you've got no priors. Roll the dice. Take my chances? Well...Yeah. From the ghetto to Yale. Just that right there... Getting in. I think I used up all my luck. I don't believe that. And you shouldn't either. Why not? There was definitely a woman driving the car? Definitely. Okay. You've still got some luck left. It's black and white, Kate. Nothing is ever black and white. The guy had a woman in the car. That... that's not a crime. The kids... they pulled a gun. - That is. - One. One kid pulled a gun. - There's no legal distinction. - Okay. But there should be. What does any of this have to do with your mediation? Why would Doug lie? Why would he cop to a DUI when he wasn't even driving? Because if a guy's gonna lie about anything, it's gonna be about a woman. Your Doug would rather face a judge than face his wife. Speaking of... When's yours coming back? - Terry's up in Seattle. - Uh-huh. Pitching a new account. But coming back tonight... For date night. - Yeah, date night! - Ooh! - Ooh. - Special. - You got that? - I thought you hated it - when dad worked all the time. - I did. That's why I quit the firm. Lila's gonna know her father. Well, that's good. At least she'll know one of her parents. So...Good work there, dad. Did you come here to tell me that my marriage sucks? - No, no, no, I... - But you think it does. Look, I just... I think it's different than what you said you wanted. I thought mediators were supposed to solve problems. Sometimes. And then... Sometimes they just like to point 'em out, you know...No charge. â™ª If I were king of the forest â™ª - I don't believe you. - Talk to me, Leo. The people from Judge Nicastro's court are waiting for you in the conference room. - Ooh, God damn it. Oh... - Nice. - Oh. Okay. - Oh... Aunt Katie's got a potty mouth! Uh...I gotta go. I love you. Bye. - Love ya. - I'll call you later. All right. Leo, something's not right with this Pease thing. I need to head over there first. But what about the people in the conference room? Yeah. Just tell them I'm running late. - Oh, no! Wait, wait! - Okay. Soon as my hearing comes back. Wait! Wait! Please! Ah! Uh, taxi! - Totally obsessive! - O-oh, obsessive? Y-you were drunk! Ms. Reed's running late. - You guys need anything? - Boom! I'd like to hear you say, Brian... You were crying! So you're all good then. Okay, then. I've got some good news and some better news. I'm comin' in. All right, well, I talked to the D.A. The government's looking at ten years, and there is no interest in pursuing Doug's DUI. Terrific. That's everything. I believe it is, yes. What about the other punk, the driver? Well, here's the thing. There's two versions of the accident. Wrong. There was one accident. Two parties involved. One party of criminals, the other my son. That's one version. Do you know who was in the car? Yeah. Scumbag one and scumbag two. D'Sean has a record, but Nathan the driver doesn't. In fact, he's quite the model citizen. He's got a full scholarship to Yale. - He starts in the fall. - Not anymore. Nathan Henry's a good kid, Charles... he's smart. Smart kids choose smart friends, not gun-carrying gangsters. Well, maybe in the suburbs. If Douglas grew up in Hunter's Point, he'd have friends with guns. Oh, please. I'm sick of hearing about how getting spanked when you were four gives you license to rob a grocery store when you're 40. It's an excuse, and I don't buy it. It is easy to be judgmental when you grow up with wealth. The children of privilege aren't allowed to fail. - It's not their fault. - No, it's not their fault. - That's right... exactly right. - So whose fault is it that when you grow up in a lousy neighborhood you study your ass off to make straight A's, you get the crap kicked out of you for not being in a gang? I grew up poor. I'm not a criminal. Neither is Nathan Henry. He not only survived and stayed clean... He got a full scholarship to Yale. Now, the gunman, he'll do his time. He knows it's coming. But you've gotta let Nathan off the hook. You lack your father's clarity. It troubles me. It troubled him, too, sir. Dad, maybe we're pushing a little too hard on this. Does it...Really matter if this Nathan goes to jail? Yes. Again, Douglas, judgment. - Let's not lose sight of... - When I asked if you knew who was in the car, I was talking about Doug's. There was a woman driving his car. Both boys saw her, and in the police report, a woman's purse was found on the floor. Now, I don't suppose that your wife ran from the scene of an accident. Carol-Anne was in L.A. I'm sure she was. No I.D. in the purse. Cheap makeup. Was she a rental? Uh, I met her in the bar at the restaurant. Oh! What? What? Oh, yeah, wake up! She had a room at a hotel nearby. Never made it there, tough. What was her name? - Oh, I don't know. - You don't even know her name, and you let her drive the Beemer? That's the part that bothers you? You pick up hookers a lot? Well... What's a lot? Jesus, Douglas. What's the point of all this? Well, facts change. Positions should too. Everything's not so black and white. All right, gentlemen, I, uh, have another meeting to go to. I'm gonna let you two talk. Call me later... And we'll wrap this up. $10 million! Do you know how much of a waste of time this is for me right now? Oh, hey, I need Kate. Oh, you know what? She is busy. She's got a court-ordered mediation. All right, well, tell her I'm looking for her. You know I will. Leonardo! Leo! Hey. Come here. You know I would never ask you to do anything that comes even close to the border of illegality. - Oh, I know. - And I'm not asking you now. Especially from your Dungeons & Dragons buddies over at the police department or the DMV. You've not asked me many times before. Exactly. This is just like one of those times. The license plate number for Doug Pease's car. Find out everything you can about him, the car, the night of the accident... everything. Why? What are you... What are you looking for? I don't know. Something just doesn't seem right yet. - Okay, then. - Yeah. Conference room. I read their file. What do you think, like...An hour? Ugh. Dinner and a pillow. Ooh. Fun. Ha. Hello, everyone. My name is Kate Reed, and I will be your mediator today. - Hi, Kate. - Can you please talk - to that idiot? - These morons... - I gotta get out of here. - A million doll... Better. Thank you. Okay, uh... Brian Michaels, you wanted to make a memorable wedding proposal to your girlfriend. - Hello. - Hi. - Quite a complicated plan. - Actually, it was very simple. Oh, please! - Yeah, like d-day. - Psycho! Jessica and I ordered a cable car, which is where we met three years ago. I hired three people, each one representing one year in our dating history, to board the cable car at three consecutive stops... The first to read my first love letter to Jessica. The second to sing, Time of My Life. And one was to present us with cupcakes with our faces in the icing. - Oh, that's sweet. - I know. - Okay, so what happened? - Well, the actor was drunk, the singing was terrible, and the cupcakes... They looked nothing like us! I wasn't drunk. I had vertigo. - I have talent! - It doesn't matter. I proposed anyway. All right? I presented Jessica with my grandmother's engagement ring. She'd given me her father's watch. He passed away last year. He loved Brian. I wanted to give her something just as special. But their incompetence made us lose the ring. - We never lost anything. - You were going crazy! - He attacked me. - You murdered our song! Don't make me... Whistle again...Please. She dropped the ring. I may have been technically drunk but... - It's not my fault. - Well, then whose fault is it? - Yours! - All right, Jessica, Brian proposed. He gave you the ring. And then what happened? Well, I was about to put it on, and then everyone started yelling and someone was trying to pass me, and the cupcake with Brian's face fell in this woman's lap and she screamed, and it... It was gone, it was just gone. There was nothing that you could do about it? No! I mean, you could have held on to it. Oh! I-I'm not saying it's your fault. - Okay. What are you saying? - N-nothing. I mean, I-I'm saying it could have happened to anyone. - It's like you said. - Exactly. Could it have happened to you, Brian? No. I would have held on to it. Oh, my God, you really do think it's my fault! I didn't say that. Actually, you did. That's not what I meant! - Okay, what'd you mean? - N-nothing. I just... oh, forget it. I... I-it's just it's really hard for me to understand. That's all. I mean, I would never lose your father's watch. It's too important to me. You think I lost the ring because I don't care about it? That's... eh... All right. I'm gonna send you folks home. - Yes! - Okay? So just be in court - tomorrow morning at 9:00. - 9:00? I'm not even awake. Actually, you know, I'd like to stay - and watch this for a bit. - Yeah. No. He's got some...issues. Let's just get this all out right now. Harrington. Beware the one who whispers in the night. He stokes the fire that never dies... Oh. Thanks. Appreciate that. And walks the endless circle. What filthy creature of the night dares call by day? Hey, it's Leonardo. I need some information. Open. Close. Open. Close. It's easy now. - Open...Close. - In here. Without my maniac fianceÃ© screaming at me and people there freaking out! It's one hand on the rail, one on the ring. My leg is free. Nobody's getting near this! Nobody! All right! I think we got it all out, right? Most of it. A lot of it. Let's just take a break. Ooh. Hot date? Hmph. Tim Connelly. Yikes. Once again, glad I'm not you. I just got off a call with Charles Pease. Thought you had everything handled. - He's calling off the deal. - But that's absurd, because when I left their office earlier... You met with Charles and Douglas without me? Yes. Well, I-I got some information about the accident. See, the boy driving the other car... - Wait. He's not our client. - I know that. But the boy driving the other car is innocent. But he's not our client. Aw, Kate... I call you in to help, and now I've got to clean up your mess. Wow, I'm... I'm sorry. I-I should never let an innocent kid's life stand in the way of our legal fees. You know, is it me you hate? Or lawyers in general? Maybe it's the fact that I married your beloved father. You know what? He was beloved to me too. My father was a lawyer. My ex-husband is a lawyer. My brother is a lawyer, and I was a lawyer. And even though I carry around more than a small amount of self-hatred, if I really hated lawyers, I wouldn't work at a law firm. And as for marrying my father, yes... I hate you for that. I thought my mother made him happy... Until I saw him with you. And I don't know what to think about that. So I hate you. It's simpler that way. Is that you, the dwarf? I'm the gnome. In wintergrasp. - Well, what is he doing? - Defending the keep. - It looks like he's attacking. - I'm taking out the towers. Even when you're playing defense, you've got to attack. - Interesting. - Mm-hmm. Focus on the wrong thing, you get killed. - I have learned much from you. - Well, I am the master. And you've taught me well. Anything on Doug's car? Not yet. Okay. Go home. How's it going with the loving couple? Good. Yeah. I, uh... I feel a breakthrough coming. Well, I-I'll stick around. Still got some, uh, work...To do. Okay. You didn't see that coming at all, did ya? That it was her brother, right? Oh...I did not, no. 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me. Oh, no, no, no, Tim, I am done. I have another meeting. I don't think you do. You're so funny. Oh...Ha. I get that a lot. What do you want? Oh. It's...Gratifying to know that I have your company's support. Reed & Reed will continue to provide the level of service... Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Look...I'm easy, okay? You guys do good work. I got no complaints. The old man was just trying to shake ya down for a better rate, the prick. Don't worry... I'm not gonna let him pull our business away. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate the loyalty, and you can be sure I will go the extra mile to make sure you're happy. What's that? Extra mile. Actually, it's more like an extra couple of floors. I told ya I was easy. - Thank you both. - Our pleasure. Oh, Tim... I think we, uh... Overindulged. Thank you so much for the business. Good night. What, am I too young for you, Lauren? You'd rather have drinks with my dad? Hey, Lauren, I want my extra mile, okay? Can I see your watch? My watch? Hmm-hmm. The one Jessica gave you, her father's watch. You know what, Brian? I don't think you're ever gonna forgive Jessica for letting go of your grandmother's ring. It's kinda hard to understand. I'm just saying. So... The only way for you to get past this is to destroy something important to Jessica. - Smash the watch. - What? - No! - It's the only way. And then you'll be even. - Y-you're crazy. - Brian. - It's the only way. - Brian, no! - I-I won't do it. - Oh, come on, do it. - No! - Just smash it. - What's wrong with you? - I'm not gonna smash the watch. - Smash the watch. - No. It was her father's watch. She gave me the watch. It's too important, I'm not... - Aah! - Oh...Oh! Oh, my God, I can't believe you just did that. I'm so sorry! What kind of mediator are you? I loved that watch. I loved how special it was to you that you wanted me to have it. But that's how I felt about the ring. Brian, I was devastated. I'm sorry I made you feel worse on top of that. Sorry that I made you feel the way that I do now. I feel... Oh, my God. It's just a watch. It's just a ring. They're symbols. We have the real thing. I love you, Jessica. - You, I hate. - Ditto. Oh... Buffy the vampire slayer. Wrong watch. Sleight of hand. It's easy to lose sight of what's important. You focus on the wrong thing, you get killed. I stopped breathing for a while. No, don't do that. Don't ever do that. Brian, are you dropping the charges and moving on? Moving on. Excellent. I'll see you in court tomorrow. I'm awake. And that's not funny. Go home. I haven't heard anything about the car. It's okay. Maybe tomorrow. Definitely. All right. - I'm going. - Okay. - Oh, Leo? - Yep. Uh, you know that Buffy the vampire slayer watch you have? - Yeah. - Well, I wanted to get one for a friend. Where'd you get it, like Toys R Us? Oh, no. That's one of only three inscribed by Sarah Michelle Geller herself to commemorate the 100th episode. That's why I keep it locked in the desk drawer. Oh. Okay. Uh... Well, I guess I'll just have to track down one of the other ones then. Good luck with that. It's gonna cost you a fortune. He's worth it. Hi, dad. It's late. - Yes. - You home? No. You? What do you think? Tomorrow morning Nathan's public defender is gonna recommend that he cop a plea. Why? He didn't do anything. I'll offer five years, and he'll take it. - It's a good deal. - It's a death sentence, Justin. Look, I did what you asked, Kate. He's not going to trial. You're welcome, by the way. For what? He's going to jail. Yeah. Could have been worse. This thing gets in front of a judge, - the law says a weapon... - The law, the law, the law! God, what about the boy whose life is gonna be ruined? Does he even matter in this? Go you're just like my dad, you know that? You make these laws up, and then you hold them up like they're sacred or something, like they're from God, like there's nothing higher. But guess what, Justin. There is. There is justice and there is truth. And who gets to decide what's true... you? Five years, Kate. It's a good deal. For who? You know what would be a perfect wedding? - To elope? - You're kidding, right? Because I've already done the seating chart. It's alphabetized and everything. Your uncle asked to sit... It's very late. Tomorrow Nathan Henry's gonna accept a deal that sends him to prison for five years. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Sorry is meaningless, Doug. Call the D.A. He has discretion with the sentence. Tell him that you don't want Nathan charged. My father... Your father doesn't make any sense. You were in the car. This is your decision. I can't. Why? It looks like I've lost the job I wanted. If I go against him, I'll lose him, and if I lose him, I lose the job that I have now. I lose my house. I lose...Everything. Oh, Doug...Please. This is so much bigger than you. Stand up for Nathan. Save his life. Do the right thing. I envy you. You always seem to know what that is. You've reached the cell phone of Teddy Reed. I'm not currently available. Leave a message, and I will return your call promptly. Thank you. I'll take it to her. It's mine. Sorry. Uh...You want me to toss it back? No, hold on to it. I'll come by tonight and pick it up. Oh, will you? I'm Andrew, by the way. Kate. Kate, I'm taking the boat out. Sailing under the bridge. Wanna come out for a sail? God, you know what, that just sounds like a great idea. But, uh, I've got this little thing called a job, you know? Actually, I don't. Mm. Hi. Hi. Oh, my God. Hold on. Hey! It was a messenger. He... he said it was important. - I was just... - Psh, psh, psh... this is amazing. This is epic. Thank you so much. This is exactly what I wanted! Um...I gotta go. I can't be late. Thank you, thank you, thank you! You have a fantastic day! Leo, I've got the picture. Oh, my God... Okay. Uh...Nathan's supposed to make his plea today, so tell Doug Pease I'm coming over right after court. Judge Nicastro. Good news. Great news! Mr. Michaels is dropping the lawsuit, and further, he agrees to drop all future lawsuits regarding the failed engagement plans and the loss of his grandmother's ring. Mr. Michaels, is that true? - Yes. - Yes! As long as I can still sue if something goes wrong with the wedding. We're gonna have a hot air balloon dropping rose petals... Enough? Okay? You're driving yourself crazy. - Makin' me crazy. - I just want the wedding to be everything that the proposal wasn't, you know, unexpected and surprising. Me too. Why don't we just get married right now? W-eh... here? I mean, why not? We have everything we need. We have witnesses and a judge. I mean, come on! - Are you surprised? - Y-yeah! It's unexpected. I didn't expect it. Brian, now or never. - Now. - Judge. By the power vested in me by the State of California, I now pronounce you man and wife. - That's it? - There's some paperwork. Yay! Okay. Picture time. Smile. Aw! Congratulations! - Thank you so much. - You're very welcome. When I have any future conflicts, can I... 15-minute recess. Newlyweds, meet me in my chambers. I'm gonna need some signatures, and then you can begin your lifetime of happiness. - You three are free to go. - Whoo! Ha ha! Thank you. I really love my watch. - Later. - Bye. Bailiff, take Ms. Reed into custody. What? Why? Because I took a picture? You were four minutes late. God. Everything's a technicality. - I hate courts. - I know you do. Wait, wait, you can't be serious about this. I mean, does justice look like this? I knew you'd recognize it when you saw it. What? Hold on! â™ª If I were king â™ª â™ª Of the forest â™ª Leo. Hey, are the new contracts in? They're being messengered over to the Pease building. Lauren's on her way to see Charles, and Douglas is expecting you. - Are you almost there? - I'm walking into the lobby. Sure, you are. Hello! Hello! Excuse me! Sir! Somebody! Oh! Justin! Justin! Hey! Hi! Did you get the message I left? Yes. And I moved Nathan's plea to the end of the day. Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - I really gotta run. - Okay, wait, wait, wait. Hold on! Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! Wait... Hold on. I need a teeny, tiny favor. Justin! Is there something specific that's bothering you? I-is there a deal point that can be improved on? Maybe the share valuation. It's just not going to happen, Lauren. - Why? - Because I said so. Please, I just have a couple more thoughts. Put them in an email. I'll do that. We need to look past the third quarter. Doug! Doug, hey. ...Can we... can we talk in private? - No. - No? Okay. Well... It's amazing technology, these photo cameras. Uh, go on ahead. Crystal clear picture, don't you think? Yep. What do you want? I want you to do the right thing. I'll be in your father's office. - Kate! - Excuse me. What do you want? I want what I've always wanted, what's best for you, what's best for Doug, and what's best for Nathan Henry. That young man is not my concern. No, he's mine. I was driving. It's my decision. I'm gonna ask to have the charges dropped. I'll let the D.A. know that he'll be hearing from you this morning. W-what are you doing? Why are you here? - Our business is done. - No, it's not. Don't contradict me, young lady. Oh, I always finish what I start, Charlie. My father taught me that. He taught me a lotta things. I'm sure he tried, but I doubt you were really listening. God, you're just like my dad! My gosh. You don't wanna retire because you're afraid you're gonna disappear, but... Oh, save the psychobabble... You keep trying to hold on so tightly, Charles, that that's exactly what's gonna happen. You will disappear, because when you die, everything you know will die with you. But it doesn't have to. It can live on. Is this your way of pushing me out? - Is this all your idea? - No. Douglas's idea is that you stay on as chairman. Oh, I-I think that is an idea with some merit. - So now you're on her side. - No, no, no, no. I'm on your company's side, Charles, always. Douglas runs the company as president, and you keep an eye on the big picture. You mentor him. You pass down what you know. That way, you'll have a legacy. And it'll be around even when you're not. Douglas has his own ideas. He doesn't wanna listen to mine... He never did. I can try. You're gonna make me read those damn pie charts, aren't you? - No. - Liar. It's a smart move, Charles. If I see the word emeritus or acting next to chairman, - the deal's off. - No, you'll be the real chairman, dad. - That's right! - Charlie. Are you and Doug on the same page now? Excellent. Great. Well, we'll need to amend the deals. - I'll have our contractor... - Hold, please. I took the liberty. New contracts. Now, gentlemen... If you will... Just... initial at the Xs. Have you started thinking about next year's summer line? - Yeah. A little. - A little is not good enough. - We need designs by next month. - I know. We'll have them. A little. Nice work, boys. Great. Well. Look at that. Win-win. You blindsided me. I got the job done. - How? - Trade secret. No. I don't think so. There was no woman in the car. See, everyone was telling the truth. There was a woman driving... And Doug was the only person in the car. - Hey, yo! - What the hell? - You don't know how to drive? - Oh, God! Ah! Yo, put the piece away, man! Yeah, that's right! Oh, my... Why can't you use your desk? No privacy. Didn't think you were coming in. Ohh. Yeah. Me neither. Leo, have you been working out? Let's not play that charade today. What? I gave up my Planeswalkers to get that picture. Dungeons & Dragons? - It's magic cards. - Magic cards. Planeswalkers...Travel through planes of existence. And they're very hard to get. Interesting. Just... Just say thank you. Is that a new sweater vest? You never say thank you. That's not true. Thank you. Kate. Hey, Lauren. What? You wanna give me a raise? Oh! No, you are willing to admit that lawyers burn bridges and mediators build them. You wanna congratulate me on turning the Pease situation into a win-win. Oh, Lauren... Your father's ashes are missing. Really? You lost the Connelly account and my father's ashes? Lose-lose! Kate? Hello! It's me. Hi. Uh...lt's late. Did I wake you? Hold on. Hey. So you must have really put the screws to Douglas Pease. He pushed me really hard to let that kid go. What'd you have on him? Sometimes people just do the right thing. No, they don't. Not until you make 'em. You know, you don't have to live out here, Kate. You took a bad settlement. Mm. I don't like conflict. Well, I'm just saying, I could spot you a year's rent. You know, you can move back in the neighborhood. No! No, no. I-I like it here. - Really. - Yeah. I have friends. Hi. How are you this evening? Oh... well, they're shy friends. Can I, uh, you know, come onboard? - We could talk. - I have company. Wow. Hmm. New tin man? Sorry. No, I'm sorry. It's not my place. You know, uh, maybe another time. You know what, coffee or something. - Coffee... - Maybe. Okay. Yeah. We'll do that. - Okay. - Okay. - Good night. - Yep. Hey, Justin? Yeah? Dad thought that you were great. Maybe even a little too good for me. Well, he was half-right. Good night. Good night. Okay. Um... Let's focus on... What we have in common. We...Both have the same sense of humor. And nobody has my sense of humor. We, um... Ah, yes. We agree on the important stuff. And that's important. Um... We both have strong beliefs. You believe in the letter of the law. It's absolute. It's always right. And I believe that laws were made by people... And that people are often wrong. â™ª Drivin' in the rain â™ª God, I can't believe I'm saying this to you... for the first time. â™ª Oh, just as they say â™ª But you know, the world needs both of us. â™ª Fly away â™ª â™ª you and me. â™ª â™ª below the window â™ª But really, it all worked out, didn't it? I mean, it's not how you would have done it with, uh...With motions and briefs and arguments but...just look at the results. As our wings the guilty paid a price. The innocent went free. And all was right with the world. Talking about the friends? â™ª We made the birds that left and â™ª â™ª the ones that stayed â™ª â™ª and all these feathered days that sing and laugh and cry â™ª â™ª and fly away. â™ª Sync by YYeTs.net Corrected by honeybunny, opel & Demize www.addic7ed.com
