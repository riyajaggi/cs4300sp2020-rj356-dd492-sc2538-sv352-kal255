 >> It's so hard, being here week after week after week. >> You just have to go into it doin' what you do. >> I think this is not necessarily as ambitious as you need to be to be an All Star. >> You want to fall flat on your face, you're so tired. >> I was using this one. >> This one? >> Yes. I cannot believe this. >> Jerell did not take yours.

 >> No one pushes Austin Scarlett around. >> Ooh-hoo-hoo. Job here. >> Thank you. >> I just said, "wow." >> I love this. >> The winning designer is... Mondo. >> Thank you so much. Thank you. >> It borders a little bit on, like, someone who might walk the streets. >> Your construction was off. >> You've got a little bit of an issue at the back. >> I'm sorry to say, Kara, you're out. 13 of the best designers from Project Runway are back... And this time, competition is tougher than ever. Each week, their skills are tested to the limit, as they compete for the biggest prize in Runway history. Who will be cut, and who will have it all sewn up? This is Project Runway All Stars. The winner of Project Runway All Stars will sell their merchandise within an exclusive boutique at select Neiman-Marcus stores and on Neimanmarcus.com. The winner will also get a spread in Marie Claire magazine and a position as guest editor for one year, $100,000 in technology and office space from HP and Intel, a sewing and embroidery studio provided by Brother International, and a cash prize of $100,000 courtesy of L'Oreal Paris. Project Runway All Stars 1x08 O! Say, Can You Sew Original Air Date on February 23, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == >> Wake up. >> I am up. >> This week I really hope I can wow the judges. I think that probably the reason I'm still here is because they appreciated my risk-taking, versus Kara being, you know, kind of safe. >> I don't know how it's gonna be without Kara now. >> Kara does deserve to be here, certainly more than Jerell, Mila, just purely design-wise. I feel it's gonna be a little more difficult to just get inspired without her. >> No, I know. >> But we have each other. >> We have each other. Let's go. >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go. >> See what our next challenge is gonna be. >> Good morning, designers. Good morning. >> This week we've come to the world headquarters of the United Nations. >> Awesome. >> We're at the U.N. How cool is that? I've never been there before. >> We are so honored that the U.N. has agreed to host Project Runway All Stars to help us set our next challenge. >> I'm really excited, just to see all these beautiful flags billowing, and you just know this is a place of extreme importance. >> As you may know, the U.N. brings together governments from around the world to find lasting solutions to some of our toughest challenges, such as climate change, human rights, peace, and security. And you thought our challenges were tough. >> United Nations building, where all the great world leaders solve the tremendous problems weighing on the earth. >> The U.N. has a membership of 193 nations, and you can see 193 nations, and you can see their flags right here. >> For this challenge you'll be designing beautiful dresses inspired by these flags. There's one from each of the major world regions. We have Chile, Greece, India, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, and the Seychelles. Each of you will select one flag. That flag represents a country, and its colors and culture will influence your look. >> I'm praying to Jesus and the Greek Gods that I get the Greek flag. Me being Greek, and all. >> Now, Mondo, you won last week's Broadway challenge, so you choose first. >> All righty. Um, I think I'll choose Jamaica. I picked the flag based on the colors. >> Who would you like to choose next? >> Does everybody want to say it together? >> Michael Costello. >> Of course, he picks me right after him, so I get my Greek flag. >> Greece. >> Hup-pa! Hey! >> Michael "C" chooses Greece. Draping, Greece, Michael "C." So appropriate. >> Mila Hermanovski. >> Papua New Guinea. I'm drawn to the bold colors in the flag, the black and white with red and yellow, that's totally up my alley. >> I get India. I love how kind of embellished and ethnic it is, and I'm definitely gonna do something that's very Jerell Scott with India as my influence. >> Well, I love tongue twisters, so I will go with the "she-shellsh." I decided to go with the Seychelles, just because it's something I don't know much about, and I enjoy sort of broadening my horizons and learning something new. >> I do not envy Austin's flag choice. That would be like my worst nightmare, to get all those colors. >> So Kenley, Chile awaits. >> I was actually really happy I got picked last, because if I picked a flag and got frustrated with the colors, I would blame myself, and not the flag. >> You have $200 for fabric, but before you head to Mood, you can spend some time here at the U.N. to sketch. To sketch. Good luck, everybody. Papua New Guinea are extremely tribal-looking. I didn't want to bring too much of that into my look. I'm just going for a touch of it, so that it feels really runway, and so that there's a little nod to it. >> I'm just really trying to figure out what on earth I'm going to do. It's kind of open, because they don't have a national dress, but it definitely has a sort of flowing beach feeling. I mean, I just--on the ocean, this sort of tropical paradise. >> How are you doin', Austin? Getting inspired? >> First direction I head into is the trim. I want a beautiful, either blue trim, like a velvet, or a satin, or some sort of a ribbon. I just want to do the Greek flag proud. >> That's pretty. >> Yeah, I love the velvet with that. >> Yeah, that's good. >> Right? >> Good, good texture. >> I'm just really trying to figure out what on earth I'm going to do, because I'm always about elegance and beautiful harmony when it comes to style and design. >> This is beautiful. >> The aqua? It's like a iridescent blue/green. Getting two colors for the price of one. >> Wow, perfect. Iridescent, yes. >> I think that's p--and then-- >> Gold, it's rich. >> It's confusing to me sometimes the way a lot of the designers are interacting. I would give somebody help, but I would only go so far, because this is ultimately a competition. >> Really beautiful, Austin, I'm proud of you. >> I may just do a turban. Kenley happens to sort of flirt by, and she immediately responds with a gushing "yes, yes, yes, that's gorgeous," so I think it's the right decision. Oh, thank you, America. >> Okay. >> I find a really beautiful blue and white print, and it looks like hearts. >> I have never seen a polka dot flag before, but I guess the state of Kenley Collins has polka dot flags. >> Time's up. Make your way to the register. >> Thank you very, very much. >> We love you. >> Bye. Love it. >> Yes. >> I claim this table in the name of the Seychelles. >> This is a difficult challenge, just because you don't want to take the challenge too literal, but yet, you don't want to miss the mark. >> I don't even know why I bought this. This is so not me. >> Do you have a basic idea of the-- >> No. I just bought the colors. >> What about a tube top and a pant? >> Yes. >> Make it quick. >> Make it quick, girl. Super-modern. It's just really important to me in this challenge to stay true to who I am, and true to my point of view. Asymmetrical, predominately black with red and a tiny, little accent of yellow. One side of the dress is rather restrained, and the other side is more free and fluid. >> Mila is creating this--a little different, not every woman would wear that--dress. His zone, he was gonna stay in there. Well, he did stay there. >> I just can't eat until I really understand this design. At this point, I'm questioning whether the Seychelles was the right choice, because I'm starting to struggle with wrapping my head around this whole array of bright, primary colors. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> How do you wear a bra with that? >> This is not "greeced" lightning right now, this is greeced frightening. >> Are you convinced you can stand out in this room of talent? >> Why is she still here? >> Our challenge is to design a dress inspired by the culture and the flag of a country. >> When I think India, I think "embellishment." So I definitely want to incorporate that into this look. >> This is pretty, Jerell, this is so Jerell, it's so India. >> Michael's done. >> No, it's all draped. >> Oh, my gosh, you are done. >> No, nothing's sewn yet, >> pretty much done. >> It's all draped. A lot of people in the room will definitely say this is all totally up my alley, "Oh, Michael, draper," this, plus, he's Greek, la-la-la, it all makes sense. >> Where's the blue? >> It's gonna get tied in somewhere. >> It's oh-so Marchesa. >> I know. >> Marchesa and Georgina Chapman, that's my aesthetic. Gorgeous, tasteful, delicious gowns, and that's what I want to be known for. >> I don't want there to be an opportunity where you can take the dress and hang it on a cable, raise it, and let it fly in front of the United Nations. That's not my goal. It's a dress, not a flag. >> Hello, designers. >> Ooh. >> Hi. >> Hi. >> Hi. Then there were six. This is the most talented room in the history of Project Runway. Mondo, I'm gonna start with you. >> All righty. >> Congratulations on last week, Mondo. >> Thank you. >> So tell me about your flag. I know I should know this flag, and I confess, I do not. What is it? >> It is Jamaica. >> How is it inspiring you? >> I'm doing this very simple, sleek silhouette. I got this black matte jersey, and it will be floor-length, and then the back is all these mitered color-blocking. So it'll be yellow, green, yellow, green, yellow, green, all the way down. >> Right. >> And this will be all open, so that's the sexy-- >> Right, and also, it's sometimes nice to have something special going on at the back, but at the beginning it doesn't look--the front doesn't look like you're trying too hard. >> Right, mm-hmm. >> Let me ask you question that designers hate, how do you wear a bra with that? >> You don't. >> I know, and that's probably the last thing you want to hear from me. >> Right. >> All right, good luck, Mondo. >> Thank you, thank you so much. >> Jerell. >> How's it going, Joanna? >> This is India, right? >> This is India. >> Well, I have to say, I think this looks a little bit like a national costume. I don't know, I think I have to give you the overall idea. At the-- >> All right, give me the overall idea, 'cause I feel right now it looks like one of those dolls that you might buy at a tourist office when you're leaving Delhi. >> Joanna comes to see me, and the first thing out of her mouth is, "Uh-oh, is this a little national costume-ish?" And she doesn't really kind of hold any punches. >> So you think the sari element of it is taking India too literally? >> No, I mean, honestly, I-- personally, I really love just, like, the kind of ethnic opulence of the whole thing, and I think that I can definitely use that and still maintain my own thing. >> All right, good luck, Jerell. >> Thank you. >> Hi, Joanna. >> So this is Greece. >> I'm Greek. My mom is Greek. >> So you chose something that you knew. >> Mm-hmm. >> This look gorgeous... >> That's kinda-- >> The way it falls, doesn't it? >> And the back is gonna be really dramatic. I'll spin it around for you. >> It's gonna be really gorgeous-- >> Oh, another dress that we can't wear a bra with. You designers, you just try to torture women. We want to be able to wear underwear with clothes. >> Michael's gown is definitely starting to look pageant-y. >> It's a fine line between settling for something that you know you can do, and pushing yourself and showing them that you can go the next step. >> Mm-hmm. >> Are you being ambitious enough for it? >> I think so, 'cause this one's got me working. >> That's good, all right, well, good luck with it. >> Thank you. >> Austin. >> Hi, Joanna. >> This flag, which country does it represent? >> It's the Seychelles. >> I have been to the Seychelles. >> Oh. >> But I didn't know that this was their national flag. >> Their flag, which is kind of, "whoa." I mean, it's going to be this sort of layered skirt, with these panels in the front, creating this sort of sunburst effect. >> I don't even know what that draping had to do with Seychelles, but, man, it was sad. >> This will all be a strap, and then there's this other piece of chiffon that sort of drapes, and you get a beautiful slit of skin sort of right there. >> Is anyone in this room doing a dress where a woman can wear a bra? >> Yes--no, no, no, I'm not finished. If you can show just a little sliver, and you're like, "is she wearing a bra, or isn't she?" >> Right. >> ...is kind of-- >> right. >> What do you think? >> Well, I don't think anybody wants the bra peeping... >> Mm-hmm. >> Especially if it's the back of the bra, which is usually the least attractive, it's a strap. >> Yeah, I agree. >> All right, and good luck. Chic-ify the Seychelles. >> I'll do my best. >> Mila, hello. >> Hi. >> So tell me about your country. >> It's Papua New Guinea. The bird of paradise on the flag symbolizes freedom, and I'm making a dress that actually does reflect the colors in the flag, so one side of the dress is going to be to the ground, and the other one, the black side, is short. So the red is going to symbolize the freedom. >> Okay. >> Mila is creating this cool half-black, half-red, short on one side, long on the other side dress. I think it's kind of a cool concept. >> This looks like, finally, a dress that a woman can wear underwear with. >> Absolutely. >> Hi, Kenley. So I would know this was you from across the room, because this is your signature print, isn't it? >> So this is Chile. >> Mm-hmm. I was influenced by the ruffles, so the very Spanish kind of flair. >> How are you gonna convince the judges that you're going beyond your regular comfort zone for this challenge? >> I am staying me. But I'm taking a risk by mixing these, you know, and doing kind of this weird, asymmetrical dress, party dress. I think everyone's doing gowns, I'm doing a party dress. >> Every week, Kenley makes the same basic foundation, a dress. There's, like, no innovation, I don't understand. You can't just do a 1950s silhouette time and time again. >> Are you convinced you can stand out in this room of talent with this dress? >> Yes. All right, good luck, everybody. Boys too. >> Thanks, Joanna. >> And I will see you soon. >> Kenley just doesn't listen. She doesn't give a "F" what people think. Her "new version" of polka dots doesn't read as polka dots? Why is she still here? Why is she still here? >> Oh, my gosh! >> Oh, that's pretty cool, huh? >> Oh, my gosh. >> Just quickly pin this on, and then we need to find shoes. The model fitting is going very well. The sort of iridescent blue/green looks so beautiful with the gold on my model's complexion. Do you see the flag sort of, like, in there? >> Ooh! For once, I actually feel really comfortable with where I'm at with this gown. I just know that it has to be fit perfectly, because it is so sort of streamlined, and it also needs to be finished really well. That could make or break my design. >> Kiss me. Greece. >> Miss Greece 2000. >> "Greeced" lightning? >> This is not geeced lightning right now, this is greeced frightening. >> One hour, everyone, we have one hour. >> So hopefully, tomorrow all I have to do is add the sleeves and hem it. That's my goal. But with an hour left, I really have to hustle. There's a lot of work to do. I have the entire back detail, which is all cut work and mitering, I have binding to do, I have sleeves to cut, I have the shoulders to cut, I have it all to put together, I have to hem it, I have to do a inset on the back. There's a lot of work to do, and it's the end of the day. >> 15 minutes. >> Austin, I'm not gonna finish. I've been working too slow. I just really want to finish the dress. >> Okay, guys, this is it. Scissors down. Time to go home. >> I think I'm running out of time. I'm hoping I can get it done. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> She could possibly win Miss World. >> The outfit, it was one of the most vulgar things I've ever seen in my entire life. >> Fabulous. >> Well the good news is, it's a fresh morning, I feel like I'm resetting. No matter how much time you think you have, you never have enough. It has to be fit perfectly, because it is so sort of streamlined. I would have bought some elastic. It would have been sexy to have at least one yard of elastic. But I will have to make it work. >> I am busting ass to get this damn dress finished. It is a risk, making this black dress for Jamaica, and honestly, I'm scared. I don't know how the judges are gonna respond to it. I don't know if they're gonna say, "You did not use the color palette as much as we wish you would've." I'm realizing how much work I still have left, and I'm getting a little nervous. It's definitely one of the most stressful runway days in the competition thus far. >> She sells seashells down at the Seychelles. >> What is it? >> It's "Sally sells seashells by the seashore." >> But isn't it like, "at the Seychelles?" >> No. >> I could've sworn it was. Austin's dress. All the colors were totally off, and you can't just leave chiffon raw like that. >> I mean, it's a beautiful evening gown, and it feels like the whole line is thrown off because it's way too short. I actually did let down the hem as much as could be allowed, but there just wasn't enough material. >> The back is exquisite. >> All she needs now is a crown and she could possibly win Miss World 2011. The Neiman-Marcus accessory wall has this fantastic bindi that we're gonna throw on that forehead. Gonna finish my draping, make a little belt, and get my model in hair and makeup. She's gonna look Indian chic. >> Now it's time to take our models to the L'Oreal Paris hair and makeup room. >> We can do the white tribal dots. >> Oh, I like that. >> Kind of future, kind of tribal. >> 'Cause her hair is a little futuristic. >> Give her a feta eye, a hummus lip, and a pita glow. A turban effect with her hair. >> Very slick, to the side. >> I'm going to give her dreadlocks. >> 15 minutes, designers. >> Oh, that's fabulous. >> I love Jerell, but I really think the outfit was one of the most vulgar, tasteless, hideous things I've ever seen in my entire life. >> It's good, leave it. >> How do the ruffles look? I still had a lot of adjusting to do with the ruffles. I had to add another layer to the bottom when there was, you know, ten minutes left to go on to the runway. >> I kind of like how this yellow line goes right here. >> Yeah, I really like it now. It actually looks to me like something that you would buy in an expensive boutique. >> I feel really good, like I nailed the length. I nailed it. >> Let's go to the runway, everyone. Everyone looks gorgeous. >> Oh, my God, I love, I love, I love. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> It's disturbing to look at. >> I think that would look better on a Christmas present. >> It's just screaming, "beauty pageant." >> I get communism from this dress. >> Hello designers. Hi. >> How did you enjoy your visit to the United Nations? >> Wonderful. >> It was an honor. >> As it's been said on Project Runway, one day you're in, and the next you're out, and that's never been more true than on All Stars. There are six of you, and after tonight, there will only be five remaining. This week's challenge had you designing beautiful dresses inspired by the colors and cultures of your chosen flags. So let's meet the judges. First, we have the designer and co-founder of Marchesa, the gorgeous Georgina Chapman. >> Hi. >> Hi. >> Hi, Georgina. >> Next, one of the most famous names in fashion, Isaac Mizrahi. >> And gorgeous. >> Yes. >> And gorgeous. Our guest judge this week is a designer best known for her own take on the American flag. Please welcome the beautiful French designer, Catherine Malandrino. >> Bonjour. >> Catherine Malandrino did a whole collection inspired by the American flag, so she's a perfect judge for this challenge. >> The judges and I are looking for a unique take on your flag-inspired dresses. I can't wait to see the results. Have a great show. ♪ >> It's exactly what I was going for. She's fabulous. I can't believe how Indian she looks. I'm really hoping the judges'll see Jerell in it. Beautiful. She looks like she could go to a party in Chile, and I'm really happy with the look. Aren't too too picky about sort of the draping, because it's really not up to my standards of perfection at all, but my model looks beautiful. She is just a breath of fresh sea air. >> I think that my model looks elegant, and very fun... Yet sophisticated. She looks amazing. I believe that I've really nailed this challenge. >> I love this look. The dress fits perfectly, the length is perfect. Best of all, it looks like something that would be in my collection. >> I'm looking at the judges for reactions. They look intrigued. I'm hoping they notice that a lot of work went into it, and that it's really well-executed. >> I think she looks absolutely gorgeous, like a Greek goddess. >> My only problem is the back of my dress. I knew it was too low, I just needed more time to fix it a little bit more the way I wanted to fix it. >> Designers, before we critique you, let's bring out your models. >> Kenley. >> Well, I got Chile. The flag is red, white, and blue, and the women wear a lot of color and prints and ruffles, so they sort of have this Spanish flair. >> I really liked the attitude of this dress when it came out. It's got a young feeling to it. >> I think it's a beautiful, young dress. >> Thank you. >> What I appreciate about it is you didn't go too far away with the Spanish attitude. You contrast it by a silhouette that is more urban. It's a dress I like very much. >> I love the spirit of this dress, I really do. >> When I think of Chile, I imagine ponchos, but after hearing your story, I'm like, "Okay, this is the modern, cool girl in Chile." >> I have one challenge for you, darling, like, try not to do a dress that looks like this next time. You do it again and again, you know, that's my one thing. >> Oh, really? Okay. >> I mean it. >> So, Jerell, tell us about your dress. >> I love the Indian culture, I love how kind of ornate and rich and kind of ethnic it is, and that's really the inspiration I just took, and created this. >> I really love the white stripe down the arm. I think it's a modern kind of feel to India. >> It's almost like, you know, Nike in India. It's fantastic, but somehow it's like wiggly, and wavy, and so wonky, I can't get past that. >> Yeah. >> At the same time I think you started with an idea that could have been right, and what I love about it was the idea of a bustier dress, but unfortunately, we cannot appreciate it, because it disappeared behind the draping. >> I just wonder whether there are too many ideas in this dress, and it's going a little too ethnic with the jewelry up here, and it's just veering into costume a little bit. I think it needed editing. >> Michael. >> Well, my flag was Greece. I was inspired definitely, of course, by the colors and the culture, because I myself am Greek, and honestly, I love draping, and wanted to do something that was just draped really, really beautiful. >> You see, I'm on the fence about this dress. I mean, it's a very acceptable dress, but it's just screaming "beauty pageant" to me right now. >> Yeah, I have the same feeling that Georgina have. The starting point of draping is there in the dress. Either it has been treated with a lot of volume, maybe too much heaviness. >> The only thing that really, really bothers me about this dress is that blue bow. I think that bow would look better on a Christmas present. >> I didn't want to just leave it as this big, blue ribbon that looks like I just stuck it there to throw the two colors together. "Oh, here you go, it matches the flag," you know? >> But it does. It looks that way because you-- because of the trim, right? >> I'm wondering whether it would have looked better without the trim. >> It would've looked way better without the trim. >> Without the trim? >> That alone would've taken the beauty pageant element away. So, Austin, why don't you tell us about your look. >> My flag was the Seychelle Islands. You know, I was really going with the colors of the flag, and sort of the form of the flag, and also just the idea of this beautiful island. >> You know, it's a pretty dress, and it's a pretty silhouette. I was just concerned about your color use here, because it wasn't quite the colors in the flag. >> I don't know, something about the ruching, or whatever you want to call that, it looks a little tortured, 'cause you didn't have long enough to sort of finish it. >> Yeah. I think that's my achilles heel, in a way, not to steal references from Greece. I will start out, you know, very slowly and meticulously, and try and do the best job I can to really make it properly beautiful, and then at the end it's like really rushing to get it all together... >> Right, finish, finish! >> ...and I think they were-- >> I think that it still doesn't help your color story, though, because would you have still chosen those colors? >> Is it a terrible dress? No, I mean, it works, right? I mean, the shape of it is pretty, and she looks okay. >> It's not the worst dress I've seen on Project Runway All Stars. >> Thank you. >> Mondo. >> I got to choose the Jamaican flag, and I read the little dossier that they gave us, and it said the Jamaicans, they are very free-spirited, and very relaxed, and so I wanted to create something that was very slinky and sexy, but very easy to wear and very simple. >> I love this dress, Mondo. I do get Jamaica from it, and it's funny how you can get Jamaica just from a simple, black dress. >> It's very well-cut. For me, the only thing that it take too much attention, to me. >> Right. >> My favorite part about the dress is the--you just use this little, simple, black matte jersey, and somehow it looks like a very new textile. My least favorite part is when she turns around, and you're kind of like in-your-face with green and yellow. >> Mila, tell us about the flag that inspired your dress, Papua New Guinea? >> On the flag there is a abstract Bird of Paradise in yellow that symbolizes the nation's freedom, 'cause it is an independent nation, and they're very proud of that. I wanted to design something that really symbolized that kind of free spirit. >> When I first saw this dress, I immediately knew it was yours, and I think after last week, I think that's really great. >> You know what it gives me, more than Papua New Guinea, I get communism from this dress. It looks Russian to me. >> I really like the neckline, and I feel like those aspects of your graphic style really come in. The thing that bothers me is this--one side's long, one side's short, and it's cutting, and they're two different colors. >> It's disturbing to look at in certain ways, and I think that was your intention, so in that way, I think you've really succeeded. >> Designers, we have a lot to talk about, so we're going to send you off, have our little chat, and then we'll see you back on the runway. Thank you. >> Well guys, we have a lot to discuss. What would you guys like to talk about first? >> Good news or bad news? Let's do good news first. >> Let's talk about the good news. Let's start with Mondo. >> Mondo's dress, you know, that is a tight, black jersey dress. >> You know you don't particularly like the piece at the back. >> When it comes to flag dresses, you don't think about a black dress, and he sold us, and then you turn around, you get, "Oh, right, okay, by the way, just to sort of fit in with the rest of the crowd." >> I also feel with Mondo, you could really see the thought in this dress. >> Mm-hmm, yeah. >> And the restraint. >> We have to admit that he did play it a little bit safe. >> The stylings were for me, was, uh, the mistake there. >> I wasn't crazy about the head wrap. >> You know when I saw the hair wrap... >> I liked it. >> ...the bracelet, and all these things that really bother me. >> Kenley's dress, I think, seems very modern and very fun. I think she did a great job of executing the challenge, in terms of making a beautiful dress, making something that reflected the culture and the colors of the flag. >> The girl wearing this dress is embarrassed of her mother's poncho. Yes. >> But it's nice about Kenley's dress, it's like it travel in an urban way. It's a dress that could be from New York to Paris, it just brings the right twist of exotism to it. >> I love Kenley's dress, but it wasn't quite enough for me. The thought hadn't gone quite through, if that makes sense. >> There was a daring that you were wishing it would have. >> Yes. >> Why don't we talk about Michael a little bit. >> His proportions were off this week, for sure. The back was too low, it was gaping at the sides, and-- >> It was just his eye that went off, in terms of the volume, right? >> And that velvet blue bow. >> Yeah, totally, yes. >> But I--I did like Michael's dress, and I did think it felt like a finished dress. It was a pretty dress. >> Unfortunately, at the end, I feel like, Georgina, that it was a beauty pageant dress. >> So, okay, the three least favorites, then. >> I personally love Austin, and I think he can do some amazing things, but I feel he fell so flat this week. And it felt so tortured, I could feel his suffering in the work room and this dress. >> Mmm. >> There was no clarity of thought here. >> The execution of it, coupled with, I think, the miss in the color story didn't work for me, you know? >> A lot of bunching up. >> Unfortunately, it's a dress, it's at the prototype stage, that means, let's work on it. >> Mm-hmm. >> Let's make it a real beautiful, well-cut, well-done dress. We are so far from that. >> Agreed, I agree with that. >> She did follow our criticism from last week and stick to herself, so-- >> Yeah. >> I just don't know who can wear that dress, or where. >> And that stripe down the front. >> I think that there was no thought process behind the dress. >> No. >> There was just, what she feels is her style and her conviction. >> I think what Catherine is saying is really true. It's like she just decided way in advance, no matter what, she's just gonna do this kind of, like, graphic thing, right, and she's gonna do these two dresses, and really, it did not come across in any way like Papua New Guinea, right? >> It just looks schizophrenic. He's really disappointed me. For me, she looks like an Indian Barbie doll. >> It did reference India, but it referenced sort of just costume. It was just so heavy-handed in its approach. And there were a lot of good ideas in this dress if you separated it all out. >> The idea of wearing a bustier dress over a T-shirt, it was a great thought process there. >> Yeah, but the execution of it... >> His execution, that was-- >> ...the arm hole down here, and the pulling away... >> I saw that seam in there. >> The neckline going that way, it was a disaster. That was a little bit of a mess, I have to say. >> Yes, yes, absolutely. Who's going home, correct? Let's bring out the designers. >> Designers... One of you is the winner of this week's challenge, and one of you will be leaving us tonight. >> Designers... One of you is the winner of this week's challenge, and one of you will be leaving us tonight. >> Michael... You are safe. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Mondo, Kenley... One of you is the winner of this week's challenge, and that designer is... Mondo. >> Oh, thank you so much. >> Congratulations. >> Thank you, thank you. >> Mondo, you're through to next week and one step closer to that grand prize. >> Thanks. >> You can leave the runway. >> Congratulations. >> I took a risk on this dress, and I think the judges recognize it. >> You won? >> I think that they recognize I'm here to challenge myself. >> That's great. >> How are ya? Oh! >> Kenley, we did love your look too. >> Thank you. >> But Isaac did warn you that you need to start stretching yourself. >> Okay. >> But you are through to next week and you may leave the runway. >> Thank you. Nice to meet you. >> Austin... You're safe. You can leave the runway. >> Jerell, Mila... >> One of you will be in and one of you will be out. Jerell, we appreciate that you tried to give us an effect on the runway, but it turned into a costume that bordered on cliche. Mila, we love the conviction in your designs. You show great restraint, but this dress was awkward to look at, and it could be awkward to wear. Jerell... Sorry to say, Mila, but you're out. Jerell, you can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Are you safe? >> Congratulations. Oh, are you okay? Aw! >> Yes, my heart's pounding. >> Mila, thank you so much for being part of All Stars. >> Thank you. >> You really are a talented designer, and we wish you all the best for the future. Good luck. Thank you. == sync, corrected by elderman == >> Thank you. Nice to meet you guys. >> Bye. >> Bye, Mila. >> Overall, I'm really proud of everything that I've done on this show. I feel like I've evolved and grown as a designer and I've listened to the judges' criticisms and critiques and tried to use that to make myself a better designer. When I get home, I am definitely going to get back to designing. I ultimately want to design a fall 2012 collection and show it during New York Fashion Week, fingers crossed.
