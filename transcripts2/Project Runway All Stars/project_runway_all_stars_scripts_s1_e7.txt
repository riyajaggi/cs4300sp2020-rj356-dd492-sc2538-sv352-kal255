 You're the winner of this challenge. >> Yay. >> She looks like a bore. >> Kara, you had the high score, and, Austin, you had the low score. >> Oh, boy. >> Kenley, you have the high score. Mondo, you have the low score. >> The top underneath, I wish I had never seen that. >> It was just bulky and awkward. >> I'm sorry to say, Rami, but you're out. 13 of the best designers from Project Runway are back. And this time, competition is tougher than ever. Each week, their skills are tested to the limit as they compete for the biggest prize in Runway history. Who will be cut, and who will have it all sewn up? This is Project Runway All Stars. The winner of Project Runway All Stars will sell their merchandise within an exclusive boutique at select Neiman Marcus stores and on Neimanmarcus.com. The winner will also get a spread in Marie Claire magazine and a position as guest editor for one year, $100,000 in technology and office space from HP and Intel, a sewing and embroidery studio provided by Brother International, and a cash prize of $100,000, courtesy of L'Oreal Paris. Project Runway All Stars 1x07 Puttin' on the Glitz Original Air Date on February 16, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == >> Wow, what a shocker that Rami went home, right? Crazy! That's intense. >> At this point it could be anyone, because he was such an amazing designer. >> Such a great designer. >> Shocked. Really shocked and upset. >> He's fantastic. And I thought his look was fantastic. I definitely do think the fact that Rami's gone is a bit of a game-changer. It's like one of the best designers-- the most difficult to probably beat is gone. Can't be mad at that because eventually they all have to go so I can get my check. >> All right, let's go. >> Let's go. Come on. >> Let's go. >> We head off to Circle in the Square theater, right there in the heart of Times Square, the heart of Broadway, like the pulse of New York. >> This is right up our alley. >> It's very exciting. I'm a huge Broadway fan. I go to Broadway plays all the time. >> Hey, designers. Hi. >> Come down. Join me. >> The world of theater is a world of imagination. It's a world of illusion, a world of fantasy, and all those things excite me. >> This week we're on Broadway. >> Whoo! >> Who doesn't love a good Broadway show? >> Yes, absolutely. >> This week's challenge is a first for Project Runway and Broadway, and it involves Godspell, a rock musical about Jesus and his Apostles. To help me reveal all we have one of the most successful Broadway composers in history. He's won multiple Oscars, Grammys, and other awards for his hits, including Pocahontas, Pippin, and, of course, the phenomenally successful musical Wicked. >> Wow. >> Cool. >> His first-ever musical, Godspell, is back on Broadway for its 40th anniversary. Please welcome legendary composer Stephen Schwartz. Hi, Steven. >> How are you? Good to see you. >> Good, thank you. Welcome. >> Hey. >> Stephen Schwartz, huge Oscar-winning composer. >> He's won Oscars, he's won Tony awards, he's won it all. >> It's a true honor to have him participate with the All Stars for this challenge. So, Stephen, tell us, how are Project Runway and Godspell joining forces? >> Well, the winner of this week's challenge will have his or her design featured in the new Broadway production of Godspell. >> Wow. >> Cool. >> And a bio in the program. >> Wow. >> Awesome. >> Take a seat, guys, and let's talk about the actual challenge. >> To have your bio in a playbill on Broadway is pretty frickin' major. >> So I want to introduce you to the director of the show, Danny, and the actress playing the role, Uzo. >> She's playing a very rich person who likes everyone to know just how rich she is. >> You're gonna be designing an outfit for this rich woman. >> And it should feel like I'm really rich, a material girl. And she wants to show off her wealth, and is hoarding her wealth, and it's really ostentatious. >> It should look like each of the characters sort of put together his or her own outfit from something they found in the back of their closet, or picked up at a thrift store. And it expresses their inner personalities in a colorful and humorous and slightly exaggerated way, but they still look great. The actors will be assembling this piece onto her onstage. >> Which is why this is gonna be a separates challenge. You have a budget of $200, and I'll see you back on the runway tomorrow, when we decide which one of you will be getting your Broadway debut right here on this stage. As they say in the theater, break a leg. >> So after having a little Q & A with our panel of thespians, we are quickly sketching away on our HP pads, coming up with ideas, inspirations. I think it's really cool that we are allowed a few moments in the theater to just absorb the... Just the magic of the room, and just the ambiance of the theater. >> This is a tricky challenge for everybody because it's Broadway, and everybody thinks about Broadway like lights and sequins and fringe. But it's difficult. >> I sketched this long, kind of crazy thing with a bow, but I was afraid it might translate into a dress. So I started sketching this other thing that was just, you know, lots of pieces. But I wasn't feeling that. I thought it could be too dramatic, so I came up with a skirt and a top. >> Okay, guys, that's it. You ready to go to Mood? >> And how much is this? I want to go for some fabric that will just speak luxury, opulence, you know, conspicuous consumption richness. So I'm thinking, like, a fabulous brocade. >> Look at the top one. >> This one? >> Mm-hmm. This one. >> I'm gonna make a fur-type stole...like, jacket. And then I'm gonna line, hopefully, the jacket with some really pop color. >> I love color. I love mixing patterns. And I like over-the-top things. >> One minute, everybody. Wrap it up. We got one minute, shoppers. Come on. >> Oh, where's the... >> Where did my straps go? >> Can I help you with anything? >> I need red. I've got red thread. I need Navy thread. >> I love Kara so much, and part of what I love about her is her emotional roller coaster. Like, one moment Kara will be singing and performing sort of an interpretive dance, the next minute she'll be, like, sobbing and having a breakdown. >> Tell 'em we get the friends and families, veterans discount. All that jazz. >> Hey, guys, time's up. Bring your stuff up here. Gotta get out. >> 200 bucks. 200 smackeroos. Thank you. >> Thank you. Bye. >> I've gotta get these clothes off... >> The brocade fabric, that's gonna be my jacket. And that's gonna be the key signature piece for this look. It's gonna tie all of the separates in. And I'm debating on a silver brocade for a top, or a red top. >> I am doing kind of this goldish-silver Lame coat with a peplum at the hip. It's definitely gonna be really... Lame, I gue-- I guess it's the word I'm looking for. Lame. >> I really hope the judges are able to pick up on my attempt to create a design that is very appropriate for this sort of conspicuous consumption-type character. >> It's pretty. >> It's going to be a blouson top. >> A blouson top. >> Very blouson. >> This time around, I'm really hoping that the judges notice the clean lines, and just, like, a certain sort of really simple, chic aesthetic. >> Kara...Beautiful. Kara's done, everybody. >> That's fabulous. >> Kara, look at my fabric. >> Wow, that's beautiful. >> I've noticed a lot of this sort of unnecessarily, over-complimentary love for others' designs, now it's, like, crazy between Kara and Kenley. If and when the time comes that one of them is eliminated, the other one, you know, might have a meltdown >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> It looks unfinished. This is not as ambitious as you need to be to be an All Star. >> We're pushing ourselves so hard every day. >> There's really no time for any of us to unravel. >> Broadway! >> Broadway! I'm excited about just the sheer possibility of having a Broadway debut. >> Having one of your cat suits on Broadway! The challenge for this week is to create an ensemble for a character in the play Godspell. >> The character is a wealthy woman who steals money from everyone and flaunts her riches. >> Oh, these are cute. >> The Neiman Marcus accessory wall has everything that you can think of. I just have to be sure that I pick the right ones. >> Oh, my God. >> Can they be classy? >> This is fantastic. >> Yeah, that-- I was thinking of that. >> Me want. >> You take. Mondo, I know he got all the good stuff. I want this necklace. >> The twist to this challenge is that we're required to make separates because the actor has to put them on onstage during the musical. >> Yes. >> Hi, designers. >> Oh, hi. >> I have to tell you, this is, I think, one of the most exciting challenges. I'm so excited about this prize being incorporated into Godspell. And I'm dying to see what separates you are coming up with. Austin, it looks like you robbed a bank here with all this kind of gold and silver. >> Well, our character is rich, and she's all about conspicuous consumption. So I immediately thought of sort of like a Marie Antoinette. >> Mm-hmm. >> And so that's why I really gravitated toward the sort of, like, baroque rococo brocade. >> Really ostentatious. >> To me, it does just say "rich." >> Well, I love it because it reminds me of-- that, you know, is it hideous or is it fabulous? >> Yeah, I mean, that's kind of, I think-- >> Because right now it's hideous, but you're going to turn it into something fabulous. >> I think-- >> Aren't you, Austin? >> I am. Well... >> Right. >> I think so. >> All right, good luck. >> Thank you, Joanna. >> Kara. >> Hi, Joanna, how are you? >> I'm good. Are you a Broadway fan? >> I am. A huge Broadway fan. >> Good. Tell me about your outfit. >> So I'm thinking of doing this top, 'cause I feel like it has-- >> Okay, so it's a fairly straightforward v-neck top. >> Well, and I'm gonna have the ties around the neck. >> What, like a little pussycat bow or... >> Yeah, sort of like this, and then-- just because I feel like that's a rich, chic effect. >> Right. >> You know, and then I was gonna do a high-waisted maxi skirt. >> You're gonna do a maxi skirt? >> I was gonna do a maxi skirt. >> Okay. I think this is not necessarily as ambitious as you need to be to be an All Star. And I'm just concerned that you're pushing yourself. Because if you look around the room, there's a lot of ambition and imagination going on, and I'm not seeing it as much here. I get it. I get that it's, like, you push yourself. It's like we're pushing ourselves so hard every day, like, you want to fall flat on your face, you're so tired. And then Joanna comes in and says, well, you know, like, "Are you an All Star?" And I'm thinking to myself, "Well, I'll be damned. I really, really thought I was." >> Mila, hello. >> Hi. >> Show me what you're thinking of, then, for the separates for this crazy woman. >> I'm doing a blouse that's going to have the chevron effect in the front. Of course, it'll be lined. I'm doing a little chubby, you know, with a dolman sleeve, just like the blouse. And then I am making a skirt out of this crazy optical pattern here. >> Okay, so what kind of a skirt are you doing with this? >> You know, it's not really very Mila to do sort of a waistband, you know, dirndl type of thing. But it might be a better look with it than a pencil skirt. >> Interesting. I mean, a pencil skirt might work. She's quite powerful, I think, this character. I mean, she may be stealing from people, and she may be rich, but I get the sense that a pencil skirt denotes power for her in a way that might be interesting. >> Hmm. >> All right, well, good luck with it, Mila. >> Thank you. >> Mondo. >> Hello. >> I'm here to help you, and I may break into song, I'm just gonna warn you. I was in Godspell at one point in my life. >> You were? >> Yes. Not a professional production, I hasten to add. So tell me what you're thinking. >> So they were telling us that this woman that she plays is the rich woman. >> Right. >> And I was thinking that, you know, for her coat to be, like, her dad's old smoking jacket. >> So it's sentiment. >> Mm-hmm. >> Right. I love the fabric choice for this. I just think the kind of character she is, this deceitful character, is played up brilliantly in this. I just hope it's dramatic enough from a distance. >> Right. Well, I also bought this for, like, trim to add into here. I was almost thinking, like, a mandarin collar and 3/4 sleeve. >> All right, work it, Mondo. >> All right. Thank you. >> Okay, Jerell, tell me what you are up to. >> I love texture. It's, like, one of my favorite things. So I'm gonna do a coat that stops at the waist with a very extravagant cuff. >> Mm-hmm. >> And the fabric is kind of stretched, so it'll be easy for her to move around in and dance in. But it's very much that statement piece. >> Okay. You've got so much going on in here, you really probably don't need very much, other than the shoe, do you? >> Yeah, totally true. And in this case, I mean, the jacket is a piece of jewelry. So... >> Right, the jacket is a piece of jewelry. All right, well, good luck with it, Jerell. >> Thank you. >> Let's see if you can get two in a row. >> Let's see. I'm definitely going for that. >> Kenley, I'm in shock. This is the first week we do not have polka dots. >> Yeah! >> Talk me through this. >> This is a really beautiful brocade that I'm making this really cool jacket in. This is my sketch. >> Okay. >> This is gonna be the bottom of the jacket. >> Okay, so it's got a little sort of peplum going on. >> Peplum. Mm-hmm. Exactly. For a little flair, flirty. Okay, and we're gonna do feathers for some glamour... And thriftiness around the collar here. And I want to do a pencil skirt in this gorgeous print. And I just think they look really fabulous. >> That is a very Kenley print. >> Mm-hmm. And then, I'm not accessorizing because there's so much happening. >> Well, styling-- >> These are, like, signature thrift store pieces. >> All right, well, good luck with it. Good luck with it. >> Thanks. >> Okay, designers, once again I am so impressed by the level of talent in this room. This is a fantastic opportunity for everyone. So good luck. Really be ambitious, and break a leg. >> Thank you. Thank you. >> Apparently, what's-- like, you've just got to push yourself and finish. You've just got to push yourself. In, like, six hours, you've got to present, like, three pieces. It's hard. It's real hard. >> The competition's kind of getting to her. She's stressed out, she misses her kids. It's down to just the seven of us, and there's really no time for any of us to unravel at this point. >> Why are you crying? Let me see your eyes. >> She's going through-- >> A little hug? >> It's inspired by her character in the play. >> And she's this rich woman that steals from the poor. >> This was, like, so easy. It's, like...A jersey top. The fitting is great. I mean, all I really have to fit on the model at this point is the cat suit, and that really fits like a glove. There's no alterations necessary whatsoever. >> She feels fine, youthful, young in the skirt, and the top looks really, really beautiful. It came together really nicely. >> When my model comes in for the fitting, I'm trying to see which direction I'm really gonna, like, go. >> Gorgeous, Kara. Great job. >> Seriously! >> It's so different from anything I ever do. So once I get my model into her look, I'm not liking the way this is going at all. It looks heavy, it looks over-thought. It looks overdone. Like, it's just not real-- I'm not feeling it, and it's not coming out exactly the way I wanted it to. So I'm going to have to rework this one. >> It's kind of pebbles and bamm-bamm. >> We have half an hour. >> I really like this jacket a lot. It looks flawless, and I did that. I don't make mediocre, half-assed pieces. I do every piece beautifully with a "wow" factor. So it must be so annoying for those other designers. >> Do I need a hem? >> I don't know, I don't like any of it right now. I was just so over it. There was materials on my table that I wasn't really fond of anymore. I haven't even started on my top--this is all I have. >> Okay, but you work quick. But don't get yourself in a tizzy. I got myself in a tizzy, and it doesn't help. >> It's so hard being here week after week after week. Last week, my look was a tribute to my mother, and I was beaten up. Cynthia Rowley was so disgusted with my look she didn't even know what to say. >> I'm a little confused. The top looks kind of... I'm not sure. Could I see the back? Oh, boy. >> It's hard for me to put my heart and soul on the line again. Right now, I'm still counting the pieces and trying to put them together. And it's really hard to come back and try to do something that I'm very proud of. >> Don't get stuck. You can do it, okay? He keeps saying that he's not feeling it, and he's just done with this, he's not feeling like himself. It's making me really upset. >> Cute. So proud of you. >> Thanks, mama. >> Kara's designs are hard to keep up with, and I'm not even really sure what she's doing right now. I know that she's using the faux fur as a stole, but I don't see a whole lot of other elements. >> Okay, everybody, let's go. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> I was using this one. >> This one? >> Yes. >> My first machine Jerell broke. I cannot believe this. >> Jerell did not take yours. >> I--no. No one pushes Austin Scarlett around. >> Ooh-hoo-hoo! >> It's day two. We head back to the workroom before runway. >> Oh, look, the mice have finished my gown. How wonderful. I love the world of theater. To be able to make my Broadway debut, it'd just be a dream. >> I have to go to a really dark place to make myself work harder. And so, yeah, I tell myself I'm stuck so I can really grab it by the balls and move forward with more energy and more passion. >> Mila's grooming services, for all your animal-coat needs. My skirt is finished, my top is finished, but I'm still working on this damn fur jacket. I've never worked with faux fur before, so the fur is getting everywhere. I'm like come crazy cat woman now. Never again. >> Mila's design is not her best work to date. She's doing fur that she thinks is so fabulous, but it's not even real. I'm curious to see how it translates on the runway. >> Austin, you doing okay? >> I really don't have enough time to finish anything the way I need to. It's definitely one of the most stressful runway days thus far. What is going on with all the machines? >> What do you mean? >> I was using this one. >> This one? >> Yes. >> I'll be off in one second, man. Sorry. >> I cannot believe this. I don't understand why people are just, like, jumping from machine to machine. >> Jerell did not take yours. I was on Michael's machine. Michael was using that. >> Ooh-hoo-hoo. >> Michael said that I could use it. >> Well, he also said I could use it, so Jerell did not take your machine. >> I--no. No one pushes Austin Scarlett around. No one touch this last machine in here, please. >> Hey, girls. >> This should be above the knee. >> I could make something to go around the ankle. >> Okay. >> I have to make some straps to keep my model's shoe on. I'm just hoping that the judges don't think it's too matchy-matchy. >> Just, yeah. I just want to get makeup on you. >> After the model fitting, our models head into the L'Oreal hair and makeup salons. >> I need sort of very evil eyes. >> Big false lashes. >> Just kind of flawless old Hollywood. >> But not, like, costumey evil. >> Oh, excellent. >> Thank you. >> Glamorous. Like, full curls on one side. >> We're gonna split Jasmine's hair straight down the middle. I want this hair to be, like, intimidating, so I kind of give her these horns, almost. >> I love it! It's perfect! Do it. Do it, do it! >> Hey, y'all, ten minutes, All Stars. Ten minutes, All Stars. >> Take that with me-- ooh, sorry. >> Where's a screwdriver? >> Kara's look looked like her model was a tube of lipstick. I think, in this case, Kara did push it. Like, she pushed it all the way to the edge, but she didn't push it over. >> Skirt is done! >> Congratulations. >> Ohh! >> Michael C's... I don't get enough of, like, the bitchy drama queen. It almost looks like a mother of the bride. >> And then these earrings, two rings. I'm just layering on the gold accessories because that's the look of this character. She thinks more is better. >> The only one I don't really understand is Mila's. It's kind of like a girl who can't get into the club. >> Oh, it looks cute. >> Guess what, All Stars, it's that time. Let's head to the runway. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> I'm not really understanding who this girl is. >> She looks like she uses drugs. >> This almost reminds me of the Chiquita banana woman. >> It's Austin Scarlett. >> Oh, did I say starlet? >> Hmm... >> Hello, designers. Hello. >> As it's been said, on Project Runway, one day you're in, and the next, you're out. Tonight, one of you will be going home. This week you had to design a look made out of separates for a rich woman. The winning design will be incorporated into the Broadway production of Godspell, and one of you will receive your Broadway debut. So let's meet the judges. First, the designer and co-founder of Marchesa, Georgina Chapman. >> Hi. Hi. >> Next, one of the most famous names in fashion, who's also an expert in designing for Broadway, Isaac Mizrahi. >> Hey, Isaac. >> Hi, kids. And our guest judge this week knows exactly what it takes to make a design pop onstage. She's the star of the Tony award-winning musical Anything Goes... Broadway leading lady, Sutton Foster. >> Sutton Foster, a two-time Tony award winner-- she's adorable. >> It's time to start the show. Good luck. ♪ ♪ >> My model looks really beautiful walking down the runway. She looks whimsical, magical. That chartreuse-colored skirt, it's moving side to side. And especially the headpiece-- it brought the whole entire look together. I want to know who she is. ♪ ♪ >> I think the jacket looks impeccable, but she's still kind of thrifty, hip East Village at the same time. That's the look I was going for, and I was happy with it. ♪ ♪ >> My model looks every inch the decadent aristocrat with an absolute rocker flea-market glamour. All mixed into one glorious presentation. ♪ ♪ >> Job well done, Jerell. Yet again, I love my look. I think it totally reads true to who I am. I think it's definitely appropriate for the challenge, and I think it stands out on the runway. ♪ ♪ >> She's really put together, and she sort of plays up to the drama of being this rich bitch. All in all, I think she's looking sharp. ♪ ♪ >> I am very happy with how I attacked this challenge. And at a moment where I was ready to give up, I'm so glad that I captured the spirit of the theater, yet still being very fashionable. ♪ ♪ >> My model looks really fun, and that's what I was going for. I wanted there to be a sense of humor. And I'm hoping that the judges see that I really pushed outside my box. It's definitely a "notice me" kind of outfit. >> If I call your name, please step forward. Jerell. Congratulations, Jerell. You're safe. >> Me? >> Your designs are keeping you in the competition, and you may leave the runway. >> Thank you very much. >> The rest of you are here for the judges' critique, so let's bring out your models. Three of you have the highest scores, and three of you have the lowest scores. Michael, tell us about your rich woman. >> I took in that this woman wants to definitely look like she has money, but there has to be some sort of a humor about her. And if you're noticing the green strings, those are to hold my model's shoes on. >> I love those. >> Yeah, they're cool. >> It's very lovely. I wish it was slightly more eccentric. I think you're relying on what's happening in the hair a little much. And so I would have liked you to have put a little more of the eccentricity into the actual dress itself. >> It draws my eye. She feels like a rich party girl that would be a little wild, but I like that. >> I get that vibe too, and there's something about her that almost is a little bitchy. Like, "I have everything." >> Totally. >> Congratulations to you because that color, to me, is a very difficult color. Pairing it with the top was a really good idea. >> Thank you. >> So, Kenley. >> Okay. Well, I really got excited about this challenge because I lived in the east village for years, and I would throw pieces together-- prints, colors... And it all comes together and makes one look. >> You are really flying in our faces right here, do you know, a little bit. In order to do that, though, you need to tweak it just a little bit. The black shoe just goes, like, too East Village, to me. Like she doesn't live in the East Village, she lives in a doorway in the East Village. You know what I mean? >> I thought you cut that coat so well. >> Thank you. >> And I was really impressed by that, given the time. I do think maybe you've got one too many elements going on in there. Because if you're going to mix a print, and then throw in feathers, and then feathers in the hair, and then a polka dot-- it's sort of like we're missing how beautifully that coat's cut. >> Right. >> When you came on the runway, I thought, "I want to wear that in real life." But then I also felt like the patterns muddle it. So onstage, I feel like it would blend, as opposed to pop. >> She definitely seems eccentric, but I wasn't sure if this woman looked rich enough. >> I see what you mean. >> Austin. >> I saw her as, like, a character who... All she cared about was just this decadent sort of luxury. I mean, I could almost imagine the people saying to her, like, "Oh, your people, they're impoverished." Then her reply would be, "Well, let them wear Austin Scarlett." >> You know what, you managed to keep it modern. And I can definitely see the nod towards Marie Antoinette. I think you've done a great job here. >> Thank you. >> I love the color, and it would definitely draw attention, which is exactly what the character wants. >> I really like the silhouette of this look. I think it's really fun and modern. >> To me, this is incredibly wonderful, but it borders a little bit on too young. Because the woman who's gonna want to buy Austin Starlet needs money, needs a place to wear it to, you know. But that's my roundabout way of saying I really like it, darling. >> It's Austin Scarlett, not starlet. >> Oh, did I say starlet? >> That's all right. I mean-- >> Good for you, darling. >> I just wanted to make sure that that was well understood. But thank you. >> So, Mila. >> I thought of, like, a woman who shops on rodeo drive. Kind of a California take on it. She just really likes to live it up, and she likes to be noticed. >> I really like the top of this. I like that white kind of rabbit fur jacket. And I sort of like the bottom-- that kind of crazy, asymmetrical skirt. But somehow together, for me... It doesn't work. >> It's sort of borderlining, to me, on, like, rich party girl. But it also-- it borders a little bit on someone who might walk the streets. That's how I feel. It's terrible. But it's, like, kind of bordering those two things. So it doesn't feel wealthy to me, it feels a little gaudy. >> Mondo. >> Hi. >> Tell us how you got your inspiration for this look. >> Well, I think when you play with clothes as an actress, you have your secrets. So her secret is this idea of this old smoking jacket that she had from, like, her dad. You know, and then she pulls everything else together from different places in the world where she's been. >> She's so sexy... In a crazy kind of passive-aggressive way. You want to see the dress? >> Yes, I want to. >> Sutton wants--Sutton would like to see the dress. Wow, that's really good too. Really good with flats. Ooh. >> What's so great is the layering of the fabrics. I imagine that chiffon alone would not look very nice. It's the sparkle underneath, so you get the richness. If anything, you've gotta just refine the length where her foot hits. That's your problem area. >> Well done, Mondo. >> Thank you. >> So, Kara, how did you come up with your look for your rich woman? >> In the beginning, I tried to make her really precious, and I was gonna do a maxi skirt. But then I imagined her just being, like, almost nasty. >> I love the red pop of the skirt. >> Yeah. >> I think it's really beautiful. However, the silver bow in the front gets very bulky. That's taking away from her richness. >> This is the best you've done, I think, for me. I do feel it needs to be developed a little bit. It needs to go further. You need a little bit more time. >> There are just these little tweaks that are needed that throw me. For example, you've got a little bit of an issue at the back with the slit. It's sort of going off at an odd angle. So I think the ideas are really good here. The just needed resolving, if that makes sense. >> No, of course, of course. >> Thank you, designers. You may leave the runway while we have a little talk. Thank you. What a great challenge. Seven very different looks for one character. Let's start with our favorites. Michael. This almost reminds me of the Chiquita banana woman. Is that weird? >> No, that makes sense. >> Yes, it does. You know, I thought the mixture of fabrics was very clever. I think it was clever the way he used... The top of that slight reflective quality that picked up the chartreuse, which made it all work together. >> He had the good sense to throw on these purple shoes. But then he tied them up with, like, matching ribbons around the feet. He said, "Oh, did you notice?" No, we didn't notice! Right? >> I liked that. >> As much as I like it and I like looking at it, it just doesn't feel specific. I don't feel like I really know who this character is. >> Mondo. >> A lot of times in this competition, we look at each other and we go, "Look, you know what, that was 24 hours they had to work on that." So squint at it and, you know, okay, we like it. In the case of this dress, that could have taken, like, two weeks because it really looked gorgeous. >> His looks always come out-- apart from last week, where I don't know what happened with that bag. >> Me too. >> But normally, you really feel he knows his woman. My only criticism is the length. That, to me, you know, looked a little unresolved. >> Should we move on to Austin? >> I loved his inspiration in Marie Antoinette. >> I loved that as well. >> And it really followed through. >> And I could see the performer dancing in this and performing... >> Being able to really live in it. >> And expressing herself in it. >> Yeah. >> So let's talk about our least-favorite looks. I'd like to just go directly to Mila's look. >> She looks like she uses drugs, this girl. I'm sorry, but that is what she looks like. >> Sutton, as an actress, could you show this outfit? >> For a different type of character, definitely. The only thing I keep thinking of is, like, pretty woman... Before she gets pretty. >> I mean, I don't mind the top of the look. I think with the right skirt, it would be okay. It would be safe. >> Kara. You mentioned that this was her best challenge, and she's still on the lowest list. >> I thought it was her best challenge to date, but I didn't like it. >> I applaud her for trying to push herself. >> There's a proportion issue and a color issue here-- that it's almost good, but it's not. >> Let's talk about Kenley. >> What she took from the challenge, about it being vintage-- and that's so her that I was a little disappointed. >> That's all she heard, unfortunately. But she didn't continue to listen about how this is a rich woman. >> Right. >> If it worked, and it was vintage, we'd be thrilled. It just doesn't really work, this outfit. >> So have we all made a decision? >> We have. >> Yes, we have. >> Okay. Designers, your looks were very theatrical... But were they big enough for Broadway? Tonight, one of you will be going home. >> Designers, your rich-woman looks were a lot of fun. But only one of you can win. Michael, you're safe. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Mondo...Austin... One of you will win this week's challenge and receive your Broadway debut as a designer. And that designer is... Mondo. Congratulations. We loved your look. >> Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you. >> Congratulations, Mondo, you may leave the runway. >> Thank you. This win, coming off of last week, was so validating. Like, it's amazing. >> Did you win? Did you win? >> Yes, I did. >> Ye-ah! >> Austin, it was a very tough decision. We also loved your work. You're through to next week, and you may also leave the runway. >> Thank you. And it was lovely meeting you, Ms. Foster. >> Same. >> Congratulations, Kenley. You're also safe. >> Thank you. >> You can leave the runway. Mila...Kara... One of you will be in, and one of you will be out. Mila, you're a master of geometrics, but this time you didn't quite pull it off. Kara, we're really proud of how you designed and stepped out of your comfort zone this week. But again, your construction was off. ♪ ♪ Mila... You're safe. I'm sorry to say, Kara, you're out. Mila, thank you. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Kara, thank you so much for being part of All Stars. You're a very talented designer. >> Thank you. >> These are always the things we grow from. >> Truly. Thank you. >> Take care. >> I don't know that this was the best challenge for me. I gave all that I had every time. It's okay. Don't cry. You're gonna make me cry. >> You're an artist. You're a loving mother. >> I just want them to be proud of me. >> They're so proud of you. >> I've learned how much I've grown over the past five years. And I've also learned how much more growing I have to do creatively. It's been a really, really special time, for all its ups and downs, and I'm just really, really grateful for the experience that I've had. >> Next on Project Runway All Stars... This week we've come to the world headquarters of the United Nations. >> I'm really excited. >> I'm not a geography major. >> Are you convinced you can stand out? >> He's going overboard. >> This looks a little bit like a national costume. >> Why is she still here? >> It's disturbing to look at. >> I think that would look better on a Christmas present. >> It's just screaming beauty pageant. >> I get Communism from this dress. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
