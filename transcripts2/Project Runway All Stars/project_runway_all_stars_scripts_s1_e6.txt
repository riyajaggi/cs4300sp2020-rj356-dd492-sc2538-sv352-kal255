 >> Previously on Project Runway All Stars... This week's challenge is to find a muse to give you their clothes off their back. >> This is nutty. >> Hi, hot white guy. I need those shorts right off your back. >> I'll do it for 60. >> Okay, 60.

 >> I want to sell this. I love this tank top. >> New Yorkers don't take that very well. >> You haven't actually got a challenge under your belt yet. >> Kenley finished Kara's pants. >> That's not okay. >> Why aren't you looking as modern and chic as you were in my head? I have no clue what I'm doing. >> I would die for this outfit.

 >> I think it's amazing that you got all this from what you found on the street. >> Well done, Mondo. You are the winner of this challenge. >> She looks like someone that should be in the Lion King. >> Part of the judging criteria, it has to be 50% fabric. >> I don't think it really answers the challenge. >> Anthony, you're out. 13 of the best designers from Project Runway are back. And this time, the competition is tougher than ever. Each week, their skills are tested to the limit as they compete for the biggest prize in Runway history. Who will be cut? And who will have it all sewn up? This is Project Runway All Stars. The winner of Project Runway All Stars will sell their merchandise within an exclusive boutique at select Neiman Marcus stores and on Neimanmarcus.com. The winner will also get a spread in Marie Claire magazine, and a position as guest editor for one year... $100,000 in technology and office space from HP and Intel, a sewing and embroidery studio provided by Brother International, and a cash prize of $100,000 courtesy of L'Oreal Paris. Project Runway All Stars 1x06 Fashion Face Off Original Air Date on February 9, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == >> You know why I mess with you so much, is because I actually have a crush on you. And then you started talking, and then I was like... >> Mondo! >> When I first got here, I thought, "Kenley is obnoxious and annoying." And yes, she's loud... >> Oh! Oh! >> Obnoxious, and annoying. >> But I love to push her buttons. >> Hey, you guys. We have to get going. We're going to be late. >> Good morning, designers. Good morning. >> Angela is looking like quite the bag lady. What is this about? >> You know, it's so hard to find something to wear on a weekend getaway, don't you think? >> Yes. >> Funny that, because I have eight weekend getaway bags here--one for each of you. >> I thought she was going to be like, "pack your bags, designers. We're going to Paris!" No. >> Mondo, you won last week's challenge, so you choose first. >> Orange leather bag. I picked the brightest, most sophisticated bag. I know that the challenge has something to do with this bag. >> Mondo picked the next person, and then that person picked the next person, and so on and so forth. >> I'm happy. >> In each of your bags, you will find a luggage tag with one of the four seasons. Austin, what season do you have in your bag? >> Spring. >> Kara, what's in your bag? Spring as well. >> Spring. Yay. >> Michael, which season do you have? >> Winter. >> Oh, winter. >> Summer. >> Summer. >> Autumn. >> Autumn. >> Yes. >> All right. This week you'll be creating sportswear for a weekend getaway look. We have four seasons and eight designers. So...let's make this a fashion face-off. >> Oh. >> Okay. >> Wow. >> There will be a high score and a low score for each season. So Austin and Kara, you both have spring. That means one of you will be in the top four, and one of you will be in the bottom four. Take a look around, and now you know who your direct competition is. >> I got you. >> I guess it is intimidating that Mondo just won a challenge and he's my direct competition. >> I have to go against Rami? Oh, no. >> You have a budget of $200, and one day to create your look. Remember to think about who your girl is, and where she is going for the weekend. Don't worry, you don't have to use the bag. >> Yay. >> Good luck, guys. I'll see you back here on the runway. Thanks. I'm sketching a weekend outfit for a New Yorker that is going to Marfa, Texas, for the Art Festival weekend in Marfa. >> My woman lives in New York City, but she has a weekend house. With spring, she's coming out to the country for the weekend to check up on her garden. Kara is my competitor. Well, I'm glad you're doing that, 'cause I know I'll win. That ridiculous--whatever the hell's going on there-- hot ruffle? >> You don't like the ruffle? >> I don't see it as sportswear. Actually, no, I'm glad--do that. Yes, Kara. That's perfect. >> I think you should do a full-pleat pants... With a really baggy top. >> Like a knee-length sweater over the baggy pants? >> And fur boots. >> Perfect. >> No shoes. >> Yeah, that would be sexy. >> Hey, you guys, we have to get to Mood now. >> Lady Mila Killjoy. >> Where's your wools? I knew this time I definitely wanted to do a coat. So the first thing I did was find wools and heavier things that I thought were kind of interesting. >> This is kind of gorgeous, huh? I wasn't exactly sure on what I wanted. Yeah, I'm going go look around. I'm always shopping for plan "A," "B," "C" and "D." If I can shop for "E" and "F" too, I'd do that. >> 15 minutes, designers. >> Or the polka dot too. >> 3 1/2? >> Thank you. My woman is going to spend the weekend wine tasting with her best friend. She wants to be comfortable, so I thought of this really cool cardigan type of look. >> It's just like picking up a person. >> Time's up. Need to bring it to the register. >> It's very sophisticated. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Bye. Thank you. That's going to be the most difficult part of the whole entire look, and it's going to require the most attention to detail. Michael Costello, I think he's a great designer, and let's see what he's got, so bring it on. Let's do this Winter thing, baby. >> I want to do like this really cool geometric kind of jacket. A short version with a tie, like in my sketch. I have to play with the fabric first, to see how it's going to lay and see how it's going to fall. >> I'm designing a skinny jean with a cape. So my first order of business is to make the pants. Pants are tricky. >> I'm not threatened by Mila's designs. Mila's aesthetic and my aesthetic are two completely different things. >> I've decided to go ahead with a pair of pants and a top. But I'm not feeling too confident about this one. >> Are you nervous, Mondo? >> Yeah. I have some stiff competition. >> My girl is like really... Just light, likes to have fun. She's going to Miami for an art festival. >> Oh, the art basel? Very nice. >> The art basel. She just wants to be sexy and cute. >> And quirky and Kenley-ish. >> Exactly. >> I feel like Kenley's doing the same thing over and over. And she has this attitude like, "I'm doing me. This is me." You know? But it's a very arrogant attitude. You know, this is a competition. At least try something new. >> Who's your girl? >> She's going to up Austin's girl in the Hamptons. >> Oh! >> Cut all his flowers in his garden, like this. >> Oh, wow, she's a real cow. >> Oh, careful. >> I saw Michael, across from me, doing like a high-backed vest. >> The fuzzy-wuzzy-was-a-bear fabric didn't turn out so good. My thing that I was making is in the garbage. Didn't like it at all. >> We're competition in this, so he's kind of looking at what I'm doing, I'm checking out what he's doing. >> What are you going to do then, Mike? >> I'm like stuck right now. >> Me too. These pants are not coming out right today. I don't want to lose to Kenley. This is like Wrestlemania. Well, fashion-mania. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> Michael is making the same jacket as me. >> We're going to have a team chat. >> Like it's I got to be accused of plagiarism. >> This week's challenge is creating a weekend getaway look, sportswear, to harmonize with our perspective seasons. >> Two designers have the same season. So it is a fashion face-off. >> It's Jerell and I, Mila and Rami, Mondo and Kenley, Kara and Austin. >> I hate myself right now. >> What? >> I don't know what I'm doing. >> Really? >> You'll pull it together here. >> You'll figure it out. I love that polka dot. >> Isn't it pretty? >> It's fabulous. >> But Kenley is doing polka dots too. Don't look at me like that. I feel like what I did last week is really good for sportswear. So I'm going back and forth in my mind. Do I show shorts again? Or should I do a skirt? >> Like a knee-length skirt? >> No, ew! >> A pencil skirt? >> A mini. I'll do shorts. >> I'm mixing a little bit of dark navy and a beautiful suede, right around the shoulders and around the sleeve. It's going to give it a modern edge, and that sense of comfort that I feel like we all seek for the beginning of fall. >> What is that? A jacket. >> Damn, whip that up. >> I still have to put pockets on it. >> Oh, it's so hot! Oh, it's too hot. >> Oh, okay. You're burning up? >> It's too hot. >> Okay. I just wanted to make sure those sleeves were the right length, so, okay. >> It's beautiful. >> Thank you, girl. Next thing you know, I look over, and low and behold, Michael is making the same jacket as me. Where'd you get the inspiration for that shape, Michael? >> From you, I glanced over your table and stole the idea from you. >> I'm sorry, what? >> Where did you get your inspiration? >> Oh, I came in with it. >> Oh, no, he didn't! >> Dude, come on now. You were making a mini-bolero jacket, and then all of a sudden it's the same silhouette. Come on, like, uh-uh. Falls kind of similar, but I suppose one of us can belt it. >> Yep. It's being belted as we speak. >> Fantastic. >> All right, where's that bell, girls? Ding, ding! >> I think that Michael was feeling lost. He doesn't do sportswear, and he doesn't do winter. I don't think it was intentional, but, you know, it happens. >> I'm just saying. >> Hello, designers. >> Hi, Joanna. >> I've heard about the fashion face-off. So let's start at the beginning of the year. >> Who's got spring? >> Kara and I. >> Kara and Austin. Okay. >> Hi, Joanna. >> Hi, Kara. Tell me about spring. >> The look I'm going for is a very Palm Beach casual chic. >> Mm-hmm. >> Mother of two kids, going on a holiday. I was going to go for a high-waisted-type culotte pants. >> High-waisted pants feel very fashion forward in a good way, I think. If you can make great pants, then you're already a step ahead. Austin! Show me what you're doing. >> So basically we're going with sort of a high-waisted khaki pants. >> This feels like a very American sportswear color to me, right? >> Yeah, and this floral print shell that I want to maybe do some sort of like flat origami like ruffles cut on the bias. >> So scalloping ruffles, okay. >> Yeah. >> I'm very excited to see who's going to win, very excited. Mondo. >> Hello. >> Summer. >> Summer, yes. >> Who is your girl? What's the story? >> It's a personal story. And today is my mother's 60th birthday. >> You're not there. >> Yeah, so this is my fantasy of my girl representing me going to her party. >> Well, the biggest present for her would be you, probably, winning this challenge, wouldn't it? >> Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, totally. >> So what's happening on top? >> I'm doing this kind of polka dot. >> I was just looking over to see if Kenley had polka dots, 'cause I always think of her as being a polka dot queen. >> She does have polka dots. >> Oh, she does have polka dots? >> She is the polka dot queen, but I am the polka dot princess. >> I think of classic when I think of sportswear. Here's my sketch. It's going to be really simple. I think a lot of girls would love it. >> Okay. The war of the polka dots--I'm dying to know who's going to win. >> The war of the polka dots. Did you hear that, Mondo? We're in the war of the polka dots. >> So...full American sportswear. I'm looking at your sketch on your HP pad. >> It's a cape. >> And Mila pants. I would know know that these were Mila pants wherever I was, whoever was wearing them. >> Oh, I love that. Thank you. >> They really are your signature piece. >> I really respect her opinion. I mean, she sees hundreds of thousands of designs, collections, throughout the year. I feel like I'm definitely on the right track with my look. >> This sweater and it's going to go over a jersey knit top, which is this color. Similar to what you're wearing. >> Very on trend then, Rami. >> Rami's look, to me, is really hard to look at. I feel like the colors are not right together. It's like too much volume. >> This is my look that I'm doing for winter. >> Okay, do we have a sketch? >> Yeah, I do. It's here somewhere. >> I'm just listening to see what exactly Michael is going to say right now. "Please explain your silhouette. Please!" >> Where did the idea come from? >> The jacket came from a muslin that I was just playing with, and I cut two circles in the back to create the holes for your arms to go through. >> Okay. >> And it kind of came together itself. >> Okay, so you're paired with Jerell... >> Jerell. >> Who's also done a big coat with leather detail. >> With leather detail. >> Okay. >> I have. >> Why are you looking like that? >> I would be lying if I said it didn't bother me--the similarities in our looks. >> You've both got the cowl-neck going on, and you've both got a similar color palette. Gather, gather, gather. We're going to have a team chat, which I like to have at the magazine when tension arises. What do you all think about this? >> I know I did try that on like five minutes into when we started working. >> I think the only issue is that we saw yours first, and then we saw yours like a while later. >> Right. >> But if it is a competition and you do see someone doing something that you think is better than your idea, is it wrong to use that idea? >> I think if you see a better idea, then you have to push yourself further. >> In your direction. >> In your direction. >> It behooves the two of you to do the best work you have ever done on these things. And may the best man win. All right, thanks, guys. >> I was actually pleased to see Joanna invite everyone over to see what people generally thought. It's really been brought to everyone's attention. So tomorrow, I think that the judging shall be fair. >> It's bothering me, because Jerell is my friend. But I'm seriously not going to change what I'm doing. And if he wants to say that I copied his thing, I don't care. >> Wait. It's 7:00? No. Yep. >> You've got to be kidding me. >> No. >> Oh, no. Now it's time to start working on the cape. I've never made a cape before. So this is like winging it for me. >> I really want everything to be very neat, sharp, immaculate. That, to me, is American sportswear. >> Why are the most beautiful things always the most difficult? >> You want to go take a break and eat? >> Yeah. I just think that whole thing was so uncalled for. >> So you feel like you're being accused of something. >> Yeah. When you're doing good, people just want to hate on you, no matter what. >> Just because you've won two challenges, and you're doing really well in the competition. I mean, that's what I see, but I can't speak for Jerell. >> There's food here, right? >> Yeah. >> Honestly, do you think it's a coincidence or-- >> I don't even know. How are you boys doing? >> Kind of feels just like dinner at my family's house. >> Spaghetti? >> No. >> Awkward? >> Awkward. >> Oh. >> The tension. >> I don't want there to be any tension, like, I don't. >> I don't want there to be any tension either. >> I just ask you to really put yourself in my shoes. As simple as it is or not, it's a square with two holes. I saw you see me do it. Then you did it. >> I do whatever comes to me naturally. >> I feel you, even if it's looking to the left. That's all I'm saying. >> Let me tell you that I literally took a piece of fabric like this. >> Well, clearly I know how it's made. I mean, I did it first. >> It's I got to be accused of plagiarism... >> Listen to me. >> This, that, blah-blah-blah. >> Honestly-- >> Joanna gonna come in and say, "oh, is there some form of cheating, the way you work?" It's. >> You can keep your little vest. >> I'm going to wipe my ass with the vest. >> Clearly it's going to be an interesting runway. >> Clearly. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> I'm looking at Mila's design. I'm seeing like bubbling on the cape. >> I'm definitely sweating it. >> I think that there's a cozy spot for him on the bottom. >> Really, bitch? >> It's the morning of the runway, and I'm still working on the cape. I decided to add some black leather binding to the seams, just to give it that extra pop. I can't afford for anything to be subpar at this point, 'cause I really have to beat Rami. And this is like, I'm definitely sweating it. >> I'm wrapping up last minute touches on my look. I'm pairing a pair of earrings and, uh, a handbag from the Neiman Marcus accessory wall. And I'm ready to see what's going to happen. You bugging? >> Yeah, Mondo gave him those boot options. >> He's helping him? >> Yeah, 'cause he wants to serve it up with these damn patent leather pumps. >> How does it look? >> Mm-mmm? >> Mm-mmm. >> I see a side of Jerell that I haven't seen before. A lot of little private conversations going on. Really, bitch? You want to play like that? We can play like that. >> My model is standing by my station waiting for her clothes, and I'm still sewing the damn red top. >> Can you check, um, your hair and makeup time? >> For my model, I'm going for a very sort of sexy chic. So I'm at the L'Oreal hair salon, asking the stylist to do like a really big wave. >> Could do cornrows from side to side, in the part. >> Whoo! >> I really want to do a nod to the '50s, so I'm going to give her a very cute barrel curl bang with a high ponytail. Get some bangs, girl. >> She needs a really, really beautiful red lip, like this color. And a very small cat eye. >> I need flawless skin. >> Pink lips. Oh, your eyebrows look good. >> Maybe do a little bit, sort of a daytime kind of makeup. >> Perfect. >> We've got five minutes, guys. >> I'm looking at Mila's design. I'm seeing like bubbling on the cape. It's off balance a little bit. I personally prefer my look. >> But I might just have it open, 'cause I like the way it looks open. I have my early predictions for all the seasons. For fall, I like Mila's pants, but I think it's Rami's for sure, 'cause that top is amazing. Spring--it's like the oldest chick from The Goldengirls, or Money. For summer, Mondo's got it, because Kenley's is cute, but really how many girls are really wearing polka dots like that? I mean, maybe Minnie Mouse. >> My model was the best I've seen her thus far. And I think that I have this one in the bag. >> Okay, you guys. We've got to go to the runway. Let's go. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> I wish I had never seen that. >> She looks like a bore. >> This look didn't push any creative boundaries. >> These two looks are so similar. >> Hello, designers. Hi. >> This week you were designing sportswear for a weekend getaway, for one of the four seasons. Two of you had spring... Two summer... Two fall... And two winter. For each season there will be a high score and a low score. Let's meet the judges. First, designer and co-founder of Marchesa, Georgina Chapman. >> Hi. >> One of the most famous names in fashion, Isaac Mizrahi. >> How are you, kids? >> And our guest judge has long been a fashion and style authority. It's the award-winning designer Cynthia Rowley. So here we go. Have a great show. ♪ >> I'm hoping the judges notice that the look is very wearable, classic... And something that you could actually go to a Neiman Marcus store and see there. >> I'm really hoping that the judges notice a sort of really simple chic aesthetic, and that they can see that I have a really strong color sensibility. And I'm hoping that they can really understand simple chic elegance. >> I really love the way she looks. She looks fresh, she looks young, she looks like she could go anywhere on a hot summer day. >> I think that my mom would be really proud of me, and that she would be honored that this is my gift to her for her 60th birthday. >> I love the design. I hope that the judges notice my attention to detail. It's really beautiful suede. The shoulders of my jacket, which I think is very unique. >> I love this look, and I'm hoping the judges see that I'm making a classic American sportswear with my modern twist, and that I'm doing a silhouette that they haven't seen before from anybody else-- a cape. >> I couldn't be happier with my look. I love the way the cardigan works with the boots and the little cashmere hat. A woman walking down the street in this would have heads turning. She'd feel like a million bucks. I'm really excited that this is truly a face off and that both girls are out at the same time, because mine is better. >> I feel really good. I feel like this woman is definitely going to stand out. He made something that looks like Moses would wear it. I made something that looks like Jackie Kennedy would wear it. >> Let's start with the first two seasons--spring and summer. Fall and winter, you guys can wait backstage. Designers, let's bring out your models. >> Austin, Kara, you both had spring. One of you has a low score and one of you has a high score. Let's start with you, Austin. Cynthia. >> It's almost so, uh, dorky it's cool, you know? I think the way you did the trousers high-waisted like that, I think it makes it more modern. >> You're attempting to do this new khaki trouser that's more high-waisted. Tailored beautifully, I might add, right? To me, on that girl, it goes a little moderate. >> I just really wanted to do something very American classic. >> But somehow she looks a little boring to me--she looks like a bore. I would never want to have lunch with her and go into a garden with her, sorry. >> Yeah, I'm with you. I can't see an everyday girl, modern woman, in this. I have to be honest. >> There's something about this girl that reminds me of a small town going to church or something. We're going to move on to Kara's spring look. I think it's a very wearable comfortable look. I like the way the pants move and fit. >> To me, I just don't see anything original about any of these pieces at all. >> I mean, we're packing for a getaway. I'm not necessarily being avant-garde in Palm Beach. I'm trying to be very put together, like conservative and chic. >> I don't feel it. Like gray, purple, and then white pants. It's like, really? Unless you're just really running out to the store. >> I think the fabric choices are good actually. And a lot of women do want to look like that. I think that's a nice look. I wouldn't mind looking like that. >> I agree, and between these two looks, it was very, very close. Ultimately, Kara, you had the high score and Austin, you had the low score. Mondo and Kenley, you both had summer. Let's start with you, Kenley. >> I really like this. I think it's really simple and chic. And I love that there's no accessories except the little orange bootee. >> I like this too, a lot. >> Thanks. >> I like that it's one piece. It's great. >> Thank you. >> I think the only criticism I would really have is, if you're going to use a polka dot, it's just line it up a little bit better in the short, because that's throwing my eye just slightly. >> I would love to wear this outfit. >> Thanks. >> So Mondo, you also had summer. >> I'm a little confused, because the hair's very '50s, the earrings look '50s. The top looks kind of-- I'm not sure. The bracelets are kind of '80s. There's a lot of different directions. Could I see the back? Oh, boy. >> Maybe because of the textiles, it goes a little like junior or something. >> The print on your short that you used last week was so flattering. And I think this week, the short's not quite as flattering. >> I really struggled this week, 'cause I--I mean, the idea of sportswear, for me--I felt like I had to do stuff that's like you guys have been saying, and I started over like three times. I know I don't want to make excuses, but-- >> It's very Desperately Seeking Susan, it's very '80s that top, isn't it? I get '80s. >> Do you? >> And those pockets. >> So much chicer without them. >> The bag just takes it somewhere that's so weird. >> So let's recap. Kenley, you have the high score. Mondo, you have the low score. You guys can all leave the runway, and we're going to bring back fall and winter. Thank you. They hated it. It just sucks when it's a personal story, you know? >> No, I understand. >> And they dog you. That was embarrassing. This was supposed to be like a gift to my mother. >> You didn't up on anything. Hey, listen, they said they would never have lunch with Austin's girl. >> Mila and Rami, you both had fall. Rami, is it something that you can wear open as well as closed? >> Yes, it can definitely be worn loose... And just opens like this. >> Can we see the back? 'Cause I remember it looked very beautifully cut in the back. That's absolutely gorgeous. I love the way the back hangs without it being belted. >> I wish you'd get rid of the green in the blouse. And then also there's something sloppy about what's happening on the neckline of the top. Looked like too much drapery around the neck. >> Right. >> The thing also about that top is that diagonal line kind of makes it look like she's lopsided a little bit. Because there's shearing all along that line, she's a little uneven. >> Okay, let's move on to Mila. >> I like the pop of red. You know, I don't think perhaps it's the most exciting, but I see your vision in there, and I see you as a designer in it. >> I really like a cape. I think with a cape it's important that it's a functional cape, that you can still move around. >> I like the geometry of it. I like the like even slivers of red. It's chic and wearable. I like it. >> So out of the autumn, Mila, you have the high score, and Rami, you have the low score. And finally we have Jerell and Michael with their winter looks. >> These two looks are so similar. How did that come about? >> Well, I wanted to show you guys separates. So right away, right after Mood, I went straight in, started working on my coat. I guess Michael kind of experimented with a couple things, changing a couple of ideas. And maybe a couple hours in, I look over and I guess we got struck by the same creative bug. >> Did you notice that in the workroom as well? >> No, in the beginning, I didn't notice. I do know that Jerell was starting his coat in the beginning. And he moved straight to fashion fabric like really, really quick. And I didn't notice that he did have what he was working with until I cut my thing up. >> Um, Jerell, I like the way that we've taken your Bohemian aspect and your tribal aspect, and you've brought it to a full look. >> Thank you. >> I think the coat's gorgeous. I wish the buttons didn't appear on that cardigan. The buttons on the coat bother me a lot too, 'cause what if she really did want to close the coat? >> She can close the coat. >> Could she? >> Yeah. >> Oh, right, yeah. >> Oh, nice. I love the hat, the hair, the sleeve length. The little leather trim, I think, is great. And it looks true to your style too. >> Thank you very much. >> Michael. >> The belt is so beautiful-- I mean, she's resolved. I find those leggings, with those shoes, nasty. If you just could have put her in a boot, I would have liked it so much, do you know? >> Mm-hmm. >> I'm sorry it throws me, but really, congratulations. I think it's a great look. >> Thank you. >> It's more of like an ensemble to me, you know, than like-- it's almost like she's her mom or something. Or she's like definitely a little bit older looking than this girl. >> It's really--it's very, very polished. She's very sophisticated. >> Well, it's clear that we all like your look, but there is one high score and one low score. And Jerell has the high score. And yours is the low score. >> Okay. >> Thank you, designers. We're going to have our discussion, and we'll call you guys back to the runway. >> Thank you. >> Let's talk about our high scores. >> I liked Kenley. I just thought it seemed confident, and it was just one piece with a lot of impact. >> I like that look. Kenley's woman would turn my head. >> Hers just stood out a little, because everybody else is like, "sportswear--we need to do this." Well, she stuck to who she was. But having said that, we have seen this look quite a lot, and I would like to see it be changed up a little bit more. >> I agree. I agree about Kenley. >> I find Mila's look boring. >> I do think, though, it seemed chic and wearable. I-I like it. >> My problem with it was the fabric. I didn't think the fabric looked expensive at all. And I get that they're on a budget, but, I mean, that's part of being an all star, taking something inexpensive and making it look wonderful. >> That's true. The thing that bothered me were the jeans. If you're going to go for that Helmut Lang jean, you've got to get tight, and you've got to get the zippers exaggerated. And they were a little apologetic for what they are. >> I loved Jerell's look. >> Jerell's was a great look. You know, that coat was fabulous. >> That whole look looked sort of anthropologie, which is not a bad reference. >> I guess I like that look. >> But I don't like his sense of buttons--those giant ones on the coat looked a little jokey to me. >> Jerell's was like kind of earthy hippie, but it worked for that whole mood, you know? >> Let's talk about Kara. >> It's a perfectly okay look. And--but I didn't think it was anything more than that. >> I get very annoyed when there's absolutely no style at all. >> Well, and she kind of snuck her way into the high score, just because Austin went a little nutso this time. So let's talk about our low scores. >> Okay. >> Austin. >> Those pants, to me, were the best thing in the show today. It just was the rest of it that was so bad. Like, you put those with some really good other pieces and accessories as sportswear, you would love those pants. >> Okay, I agree--he knows how to do some things well, but he doesn't know how to put things together. >> To me his intent here was like completely different than what we would think was cool. You know what I mean? >> I definitely don't think this is Mondo's best look. >> I didn't like the... choice of fabric. I didn't like the proportions really. I hated the accessories. And I thought it seemed ill-fitting and sort of not well made. >> It's a good look. It's just not quite as brilliant as last week, but it is a very good look. >> Rami's look just makes me kind of ill--those colors. I don't know why he would have chose those. >> That jacket was beautifully cut on the shoulders. >> Yeah, and the green just took everything away. >> I didn't like it. >> In comparison to the rest of the look the jacket looked good. >> It looked like a draping project to me. >> The top underneath, I wish I had never seen that. >> Me too. >> What did you think of Michael? >> Well-- >> there was apparently a lot of drama that was happening. >> I have to say, the design is not his strongest thing. It's the execution of a design. But he goes, "oh, what if I were to look exactly like something else today?" >> And remember the heels with the leggings, guys. >> Mm-hmm. >> But I think his proportion is good. >> Yeah, proportion, execution-- but I just don't know if he copied that coat. >> Also he seems much more insecure, and Jerell seems so sure of himself. >> I feel, with Michael, if he was to do a collection, I don't know what we would get... >> Me either. >> At all. >> Me either. >> So, have we made our decision? >> Reluctantly. >> Okay, let's bring the designers back out. >> Designers. One of you has been voted this week's winner... And one of you will be eliminated. >> Designers. One of you has been voted this week's winner, and one of you will be eliminated. Mila, Kara, you're safe. You can leave the runway. Jerell. Congratulations. You are the winner of this challenge. That means you're through to next week, and one step closer to the grand prize. >> Totally cool. Thank you guys so much. >> Jerell, you can leave the runway. >> Thank you. Good luck. Good luck, everybody. It feels fantastic to be the winner in this challenge. I won. I definitely think my look was ambitious. I think my pieces were pulled off beautifully. And with the doppelganger on the runway, I'm happy the judges were able to see the real McCoy. >> Kenley, we all loved your design too. >> Thanks. >> Congratulations, you can also leave the runway. >> Thank you. Michael, Mondo. You are safe, and you can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Good luck, guys. One of you will be in and one of you will be out. Rami, your neckline had way too much bulk and needed to be simplified. And the shirt looked like a mistake that you tried to cover up. Austin, the tailoring in your trousers was impeccable. But this look didn't push any creative boundaries. And the styling missed the mark again. Rami... ...you're out. Austin, you are safe. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Congratulations. Rami, thank you so much for being part of All Stars. >> Thanks for having me. >> You're such a talented designer and we really... >> Thank you. >> Wish you all the best. >> Thank you very much. >> Hear, hear. >> Good luck. >> Thank you. This was my first time on the bottom and I happened to be eliminated. Life goes on. The universe will take care of me in its own way. Hi. >> Oh, Rami, I'm so sorry. >> It's okay. It's impossible for everyone in the world to like everything that you do. And I'm okay with that, because I realize that's just the way life is. >> Beautiful. >> That jacket was gorgeous. >> Congratulations. >> Amazing. >> All Stars had given me the exposure that I needed to kick off what's to come next. So it was definitely a great platform to showcase some of my work, and I'm grateful for that. >> Next on Project Runway All Stars... This week we're on Broadway. Whoo! >> It's a world of illusion, a world of fantasy, and all those things excite me. >> Dude! >> It's like crazy between Kara and Kenley. >> Don't look stuck. You can do it. >> It's so hard being here. >> You've just got to push yourself. You want to fall flat on your face. >> That is a very Kenley print. >> It looked like an extra from Boogie Nights. >> Broadway! >> I'm not really understanding who this girl is. >> She looks like she uses drugs. >> This almost reminds me of the Chiquita banana woman. >> It's like she doesn't live in the East Village, she lives in a doorway in the East Village. >> Visit mylifetime.com to learn more about the fashion seen on tonight's show. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
