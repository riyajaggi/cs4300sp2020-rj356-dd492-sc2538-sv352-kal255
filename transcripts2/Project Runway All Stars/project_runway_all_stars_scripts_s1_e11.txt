 would typically retail for about $380. You have about $40 left to work with in fabric. >> It does look like a tin can with a string hanging out. >> How do you wear a bra with this? >> It's a little harder to sell. >> This is gorgeous the way it is. ♪ ♪ >> I really like this dress. I think it's masterful.

 >> I like your use of fabrics, and that's where you are very strong. >> Congratulations, Mondo, you're the winner of this week's challenge. >> This is amazing, thank you. >> Some things that look great for retail just don't do enough on the runway. >> Here you've managed to do something very sensual rather than overtly sexual. >> I'm sad because there was a beautiful detail on the sketch that's missing from the dress now. >> Oh, the keyhole? >> You needed to add that special touch. >> I'm sorry to say, Kenley, that means you're out. 13 of the best designers from Project Runway are back. And this time, the competition is tougher than ever. Each week, their skills are tested to the limit as they compete for the biggest prize in runway history. Who will be cut, and who will have it all sewn up? This is Project Runway All Stars. >> The winner of Project Runway All Stars will sell their merchandise within an exclusive boutique at select Neiman Marcus stores and on Neimanmarcus.com. The winner will also get a spread in Marie Claire magazine and a position as guest editor for one year, $100,000 in technology and office space from HP and Intel, a sewing and embroidery studio provided by Brother International, and a cash prize of $100,000, courtesy of L'Oreal Paris. Project Runway All Stars 1x11 Finale, Part 1 Original Air Date on March 15, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == >> Good morning, everyone. >> Hi. >> Good morning, Angela. >> Austin, you shaved. >> I did. I decided to shave my mustache just as a sort of a fresh start, a new beginning, a renaissance as it were. >> He went from Errol Flynn to Kermit the Frog. >> We began with 13 All-Star designers. 11 weeks on, and only three of you remain. You've all made it to the Project Runway All Stars final challenge. Congratulations. Thank you. >> So the Project Runway All Stars of All Stars are Michael Costello, Austin Scarlett, and myself. >> One of the three of you will be walking away with the biggest prize in Project Runway history. To help reveal your challenge, please welcome to the runway some familiar faces. >> I'm feeling very anxious. >> Oh, my goodness. >> Hi! >> Hi, kids. >> Hi. >> Hello. >> Welcome to the runway. >> Thank you. >> So, designers... The best way for a designer to present their work is with a high-profile runway show for their collection. Now a designer would usually spend months slaving away on creating their best work for this. Even on Project Runway, they get weeks. But this is All Stars, and we know what you're capable of. >> Your final challenge is to design a mini collection to showcase your skills and talents as designers, and we want to see five different looks. >> You have four days to put this little collection together. >> Five looks? >> Yes, guys, we have a full runway show ready to go in just five days' time. >> Just even making it to the finale--that's scary enough, but now knowing what your challenge is--that's frightening. It's frightening. >> VIP guests have been invited. >> Uh-oh. >> And a very special location has been booked. You have a budget of $3,000 to shop for fabric at Mood. And of course, you have that fabulous Neiman Marcus accessory wall to add to your looks. >> In a couple of days' time, there will be a model casting, where you'll choose five models each for your own runway show. >> Usually, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire magazine, Joanna Coles, joins you in your workroom. This time, she's invited you to her workroom. >> Awesome! >> Oh, cool. >> Oh, I can't wait. >> So it's time for you to visit Joanna Coles at Marie Claire's headquarters. Good luck. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Bye. >> Marie Claire, here we come. >> Here we come. Beautiful building. As soon as we walk up, there was this awesome escalator and high glass ceilings. I felt like Joanna Coles getting ready to go to work. >> Hello. >> Good morning, guys. Welcome to Marie Claire. >> Thank you. >> Why don't you follow me? >> All righty. It's all so surreal. It's like words really cannot express. I feel like I'm in a dream. >> You guys have a seat. >> All right. >> Thank you. >> This is a huge opportunity, and this experience could possibly change my life. I'm nervous. I'm so nervous. Ah! This is insane. >> We wait... And wait... And wait. >> Oh, my goodness! Welcome to my world. >> I look forward to Joanna's consultations because she really has a wise and insightful professional point of view. It's very exciting. >> You have all worked so hard. Now tell me how you feel about having to produce the collection for the runway. Nervous, frantic, I mean, I think all of our minds are just racing. >> What do you basically look for in a collection? >> What you're looking for is a shift from the previous season. And then when you're seeing as many as 50 to 70 shows, you're looking for themes. And then you're looking for people who are doing it really well. >> How do you feel when you go to runway shows? The theatrics and the over-the-top styling? And how can it affect you being in a competition? Because we've all been kind of criticized of being a little too theatric. How do we walk that line? >> It's a very good question. I think that it depends on the designer. And are the theatrics authentic to the collection that they're doing? I don't think it's in any way essential to showing a great collection. >> Can you tell us about the guest editor position here at Marie Claire? >> What the guest editor will be involved in doing is joining our fashion team when we discuss what themes we think are going to appeal to our readers and working out how to interpret the runway looks for our readers who want to wear fashion in their real lives. You'll be working with Nina Garcia and her team. And, uh, it's really fun. I never wake up in the morning thinking, "Oh, I have to go to work." I always feel like, "Oh, I can't wait to get there." >> This prize of being a guest editor for Marie Claire is, like, my dream job. >> Marie Claire is a huge magazine. It's a major foot into the fashion industry, and it's a route that I can take to help better my career as a fashion designer. >> It would be so much fun. >> I love being part of a team. I really love collaborating with other creative people to accomplish the big picture. >> Good, well, the next four days are going to be very intense for you. I'm excited for all of you, and I would be thrilled to have any one of you join the Marie Claire team. Well-done for making it this far, and I can't wait to see the show. All right, good luck, guys. >> Bye, Joanna. >> The boys and I head off to sketch. >> It's a beautiful day outside. The weather is really nice. Well, there's a lot of green, and I'm trying to find out how to translate that green into my collection. >> I will be making a wedding dress--the ultimate dress that most women will wear in their lives. There is something just so fantastically fashion about ending a collection in a beautiful wedding dress. >> This is my moment to redeem myself so I really have to just focus. >> This is what I was meant to do, what I was born to do. And now I just really want to win, win, win. >> I think I want it more than Austin and Mondo. And I'm here to compete 'cause I want that prize. >> There can only be one winner in this competition, and as much as I love Michael... I really want to win. I want to win. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> I'm frustrated, and I want to quit. I just wanna to stop. >> You like the new setup? >> I love that I can shut my door. >> Whenever I try and help Mondo, he sort of throws it back in my face. >> We are going to create a five-look collection in four days. >> It's very frantic to try and choose fabric for a collection in just an hour. Okay, can we put this in my pile? >> I wanted, like, some kind of silk jerseys. Oh, this is gorge. >> I'm really inspired by this African safari. I picture my collection being on an adventure. Perfect. >> This is where you have to commit. Man, I don't even know how I'm gonna do it. I mean, usually I'm really comfortable going into the fabric store. This time I'm going on with a blindfold really. >> Do you have an idea for your collection? >> Uh, no, I'm just pulling things that I'm attracted to right now. And then I will re-edit. I'm just not feeling it. I'm not feeling it. >> I do like this, yes. I sort of see this woman as if she stepped out of a Fragonard painting, but she is a modern-day rock star meets Hasidic gentleman. >> Ten minutes! Ten minutes and counting. >> All right, we'll leave the four of that one. Just do four of this one. >> I'm gonna need absolutely this whole roll for my wedding dress. >> Thank you so much. >> Think I have everything. >> Back to 1407. >> Thank you, bye. >> Oh! >> Oh, this is all different. Overnight the entire workroom is transformed, especially for the three finalists. So is this our mini-workroom in here? We each have our own petit atelier. Perfect, it is big enough for my dress. It's definitely nice to have sort of a calm oasis where I can focus on what I need to focus on. >> You're happy with what you got, Mondo? You're not? >> I couldn't even concentrate. >> Do you like the new setup? >> Mm... Yeah, I love that I can shut my door. >> Ahem. >> I hope you won't be completely closing us off to seeing what you're up to or vice versa. I want your opinion. But yeah, if you feel like you need... >> Space. >> Space and time to yourself, I also respect that. Yeah, you'll see it soon enough. >> Okay. Whenever I try and help Mondo, he sort of... Throws it back in my face. >> I unpack my fabrics, take a look at them, and I'm really disappointed. I'm not happy with what I got. Finding inspiration for myself right now from these fabrics is really hard. I'm frustrated, and I want to quit. I just wanna stop. >> My collection is really just Austin Scarlett. Each look really has a sophistication to them, but there's also a whiical sense to them. And that's always something that I love to balance. Just sort of a fun, frivolous feeling combined with something sort of very elegant and refined. >> You are going on a safari. >> Yeah. >> This is like exotica. >> I just want it to be fun, adventurous but still keep it sexy. The lady who wears them is going on a crusade with Indiana Jones and the Last Costello. >> Whoo-hoo! You are in business. >> Did you do anything yet? >> It's a lot of pressure, Mike. >> Okay. >> I feel dead inside. I don't feel one ounce of motivation. I'm just gonna shut my door. >> I said, "If you wanna come hang out, you know, take a load off your chest or something, come next door and talk to me and play my little safari." And he was like, "No, thanks. I don't wanna go to the zoo." >> That--okay, that's what's not cool. We all have stresses. We all are in the same competition. >> Well, we all are having it hard different ways. I have kids. None of the other contestants know what it's like to be away from your kids. That's tough. So for him to say that he takes things in a different way or his process is totally different, it's kind of disrespectful in a way. >> I have all sorts of that I'm dealing with. My family-- >> That's true. >> My mother was just evicted from her house. >> I know. >> She's, like, homeless right now. I need to win this competition, so I can pay so my mother can have a place to live, okay? >> True. >> I think it's really, uh, sort of immature to not... >> I agree. >> Recognize that others have a life. >> I'm hanging out in my room. I'm in a total funk, and then there's a voice. "Designers, designers." >> Hi, guys, how are you? >> Hello, Georgina, is that you? >> Hi. >> Hi. How are you? >> It's wonderful to see you... >> How are you? >> In person--or up close for the first time. >> I know, no runway between us. >> I've admired her and her work for years. You always see the most beautiful dresses on the red carpet--they're always Marchesa. >> This is the fashion industry right in front of your face. What better feeling can you get than that? >> So where are you guys at? >> I love the direction that I'm going in. I see the shoe. I see the hair. I see the glasses. I see the accessories. I see how everything just looks. >> But this time we do get a little more time to think it through, compose. Neiman Marcus has been really great. >> Neiman Marcus actually gave me my start in the industry. They're a very nurturing company. To become part of the Neiman's family is a huge thing. And I think you want to think about that. >> When you go to a runway show... >> Yeah. >> What do you like to see? >> I like to see an idea. I like to see a vision. I want something to excite me, to be like, "Wow, that's an incredible idea. I've never seen that before." Mondo, you look like you've had enough. >> I'm just tired of people telling me what I'm capable of doing... >> Mm-hmm. >> And expecting things from me. And it's just like, I'm not happy right now. >> Mm-hmm. So do you need to take a moment? >> I've taken probably half the day. I haven't even cut anything at this point. >> That's okay. I have been to the worst places before my collections--terrible. I used--I never used to sleep. It used to be a disaster. And I'd be lying in bed. I'd be like, "why am I doing this to myself? This is torturous." As I learn and do more and more collections-- and now I've learned not to have the breakdowns. >> Right. >> And--but then I got worried that if I don't have a breakdown, "Am I gonna be as creative?" >> I love Georgina. She's so down-to-earth, and she gets us because she's a designer too. >> I think you all have the potential to win this... For sure. Lots and lots of luck, and I will see you in four days. >> Thank you. >> Bye-bye. >> It was definitely reassuring to know that Georgina, like us, suffers from sleepless nights and the horror and torment of being ripped to shreds by critics. >> Bye, see you soon. >> Take care. >> That was nice. Everything she said was wonderful. >> I've given up. I've decided that today for me is a free day in the workroom. I just don't want to waste my time, so I might as well just lounge on the couch. >> I can't believe you, like, have a dress done already. I love that. The back is just so-- you're amazing. Oh, okay, everyone. Are you ready? >> I'm not. >> I'm starved. >> Come on, let's go eat. >> Oh, what a day! >> Thank you. Well, boys-- >> What are we toasting to? >> To the art of fashion. >> To the art of fashion. >> I'm in a foul mood. I don't know where I'm at in my head. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm done. >> Are you serious? >> Yeah. >> Sometimes maybe he does only think about his feelings and that's one of his downfalls. You know, it's a lot of negative energy. >> We haven't even had dessert. >> And when he's in that mood, that's when he turns out his best work ever. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> Today's the model casting. Gorgeous, I love you. >> Austin has taken the opportunity to become the "casting director." Such a. >> Another day, another dress. >> It's day two. I'm gonna have to try and pull a little bit of a miracle. I got to make something that's gonna wow Georgina. I got to make something that Isaac's gonna say he's in love with. I got to make something that Angela is gonna want to wear. It's stress, and it's hard. >> This experience has literally made me crazy. I need therapy, so that's my whole inspiration. I'm doing a collection called "therapy." >> Ladies, we are ready for you. Come on in. >> Will you do a walk, please? Smoldering. >> Model casting is crucial to your show. And it's important to find the right girl and to also be inspired by that girl. >> Could I just quickly throw a skirt on you to see how you move? >> Yes. >> I'll be right back. >> Seriously? Did he do that right now? >> Come on, really? >> Just slip that on over. >> This has been a trend with Austin throughout the season. Whatever he wants, he usually gets it... >> Gorgeous, I love you. >> Without even taking in consideration anybody else. >> So we both really love >> I'm not gonna back down on that one. >> So...Neither will I. So I think the only fair thing to do is to flip a coin. >> Sure, let's do it--flip it. >> Heads. >> Tails. >> All right, darling. >> Thank you. >> And then I guess I'll take Rae. >> Wait, wait, wait, nuh-uh. >> No? >> No. >> Heads. >> He gets Rae. >> Good for Austin. That's become my motto. "Good for Austin." >> Happy casting. >> He's such a. >> So I'm thinking of all of these ideas of, like, acupuncture and, like, shock therapy. Now that I put the sleeves on it, I don't know if it takes it into wizard territory. >> And I love this idea of Rorschach inkblots, and I think it's really cool. And it definitely does tell the story of therapy. Ooh, it's pretty. >> This stuff is like velvet. I've always been really obsessed by the traditional attire of the Hasid men. They're always in gorgeous black brocades and satins. Gorge. I hope the judges recognize the cohesive aspects of the collection that I feel are there. >> Designers. >> Hi. >> Hi, Isaac. Mr. Mizrahi. I'm excited to see Isaac. I think I have a little man crush on Isaac. He's pretty adorable. >> Firstly... You got these CDs of music for your fashion show, so-- >> Oh! >> And I encourage you to listen quickly and sort of, like, put your bids in for you want 'cause there's only three tracks and you have to decide, so-- >> Oh! >> Now I want to talk about the psychology of showing clothes. You have five passages, right? You show your newest thing first, right? And your grandest thing last. >> Have you ever been in a position where you really, really believed about a particular look, and no one else really got it? And you said, "You know what? I'm doing it anyway"? >> Every season. >> That's reassuring. >> It is--I'm telling you, you can rest assured that that's why they pay you the big bucks or they will someday. >> It's because you have the balls to not listen to anybody else and to do something big and fabulous. >> I'm really quiet 'cause I just really want to take it all in and hear what he's saying. Because we can't just get this advice anywhere on the streets. So it's really cool. >> You've come this far, darlings, so please enjoy the process. 'Cause if you don't enjoy the process, we will be able to tell. >> All right. >> Thanks for coming to visit. >> Have fun. >> Thank you, Isaac. Isaac really gives me the confidence that I'm doing a great collection and that I just have to make sure I get it done in time for the runway. >> This one's me too. ♪ ♪ Okay, I got track number two. Settled. >> Austin... Do you want to go hear it? >> Yeah. You know, I think-- >> I picked this one. This is number three. >> How many are there to choose from >> Three. ♪ ♪ >> This is the one he picked. >> It seems like whenever designers have to choose something, I'm always the last one who gets to choose. So I don't know whether to take that as just sort of an insult like, "I'm not friends with you," or, "you're, like, my hardest competition." I do like the guitar 'cause it's like rocker, glam. >> Hey, you guys. One hour left until the end of the day. How are you doing? >> Okay. >> Is that leather? >> Leatherette. >> Cute. I could be very critical about this, but he's giving you true Austin Scarlett glamour. >> What do you think of my pants? >> Cool. >> Do they look like a skirt? >> Yeah, kind of. It's just really hard to wear Michael's clothes unless you're a model. None of them can be worn with a bra, and that's just not realistic. I don't just design for a slender supermodel. I design for real women. >> Hey, guys. It's time to go home. >> Oh, wow, that looks great. Mondo's theme of therapy is pretty good. But my collection really is sexy, cool, feminine, and just killer. Three very different collections. >> Starlet Scarlett. That's what he is. >> Hello, designers. Hi, Angela. >> Working hard? >> Yes. >> Is this how you're always working, all done up like this? >> Yes. >> It's been a long time since I've been by 1407 Broadway, and I'm super excited to see what you guys are coming up with. But this wouldn't be an All Stars... without an All Stars twist. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars. >> Look what the cat dragged in. >> Hi, guys. >> I'm not ready for a twist. >> It's, you know, intimidating. >> This wouldn't be an All Stars... without an All Stars twist. >> Okay. >> We decided we wanted just one more look. >> This collection is important to me. I'm trying to really make it cohesive, so I'm not ready for a twist right now. >> Your five-looks collection is gonna become six. >> It's intimidating that you have to make a sixth look, but this is part of being an All Star. >> On Project Runway, the phrase "One day you're in, and the next, you're out," can also work with fabrics. Let's bring out your models. >> Oh, my God! >> All of our old fabric. >> We've got a little bit of the opera, Miss Piggy. >> Oh, my goodness. >> We've kept it all, and this is what you'll use to create your sixth look. Now this look must be incorporated into the overall theme of your collection. >> When you have to use scraps from previous designs, you know, it could damage the whole collection. There is nothing really safari in my basket. It's insane. It's really insane. >> This is fun. >> We all know you're gonna do a great job, but even All Stars need a helping hand this late in the game. So we've invited some familiar faces to join us back in the workroom to help you out. >> Come on out, guys. >> Oh-ho-ho-ho! Look what the cat dragged in. >> All the designers from the season that have been sent home come back to haunt us. Honestly... It's a little uncomfortable. >> Designers. You can pick one fellow designer to help you over the next 24 hours. Now, Mondo, you won last week's challenge. So who would you like to choose to help you out in your workroom? >> I'm going to pick Mila. >> Mila, nice. >> I picked Mila because of her technical abilities. I like her approach to design, and I like her work ethic. >> Mondo, who would you like to choose to go next? >> Oh, God. >> Go ahead and pick Michael. It's fine. >> Just to be fair, Austin, you can choose first. >> Oh! >> Wow! >> I'm gonna choose my fellow aristocrat. Her serene highness, the Princess Antoinetta. >> Yeah! >> Anthony and I do have just similar couture aesthetic. So I thought he would really be able to get my point of view. Thank you. >> I'm gonna choose that silver fox right over there, Miss Johnston. >> Ooh! >> I guess I can be your bitch for 24 hours. >> I know her from my season and I know what she's capable of. >> See you soon. >> Bye, designers. >> Good luck. >> Bye. >> Which room is this? To the right? >> I'll take that. >> This is one, two-- >> Three, four, five. >> What should we do for the sixth piece? >> Pants would work beautifully. >> Thank you for helping me. I want to see what's in here. >> I am a little surprised that Michael picked me. My style is so different. But this look is gonna be very well executed, and it's gonna be up to my standards for sure. >> So it's really, like, black, white, red, and silver so far? >> Mm-hmm, and it's only five. Well, now it's six looks. >> It's weird being back in the workroom. But of all the people there, I'm happy to support Mondo. This from the park? >> Yeah, that's from the park. >> You don't want that one. >> No. >> Yeah, no. >> This is, like, the collection. The theme is sort of Fragonard, Madame de Pompadour meets 21st-century rock star/Williamsburg Hasidic gentleman. >> Okay. >> Any questions? >> No. Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey. I love Austin, and I hope he does well, but I think that Austin's collection is most definitely requiring the hands of Anthony l. Williams. >> I don't know what on earth I'm going to do for the sixth look. I don't want it to throw off the entire collection. >> How much leather do you have? >> It's not bad though. >> Pretty cool-looking. >> I like that, yeah. It's weird, you wouldn't think that it would work, but-- >> Oh, I would. >> I have enough to do, like, a skirt. Or make another pant. Or bodice and leggings. Like, leggings. >> A little bit of structure right here. >> Okay. I'm working on the fifth look, which is a structured dress with long sleeves and lots of different sections all pieced together. I'm attaching the skirt part to the bra and lining up the seams. >> Oh, that looks sweet. >> Let's cut some pink and see how that works. >> So no bust darts or anything, right? >> No. >> Hi, darling. Models come in for their fitting, and it is like a zoo. So I'm gonna fit you guys one by one, and I'll come out and get you. >> This is so hot. >> Isn't it? >> This was the sixth outfit. Just this morning they're like, "Now you have to make six outfits." >> Oh! >> Ultimately, I decide to create this leather tuxedo jumper made out of leather left over from the street wear challenge. >> Gorgeous, ah! >> So my sixth look is from the leftover fabric where we had our flag challenge. I had tons of that white fabric left over from the Greek dress that I did. >> Worse comes to worse, I have those shorts to back me up, right? I'm gonna use black jersey from the Jamaican flag, the zigzag black and white silk from Nanette Lepore, some of the clear vinyl from the lighting challenge, and some silk charmeuse from the "Night at the Opera" challenge. >> While some of his textile choices are not my personal choice, I respect his selection as a designer. >> Thank you, bye, Angelique. >> Oh! That's perfection. >> Oh, yeah, I like that. >> The greatest thing about working with Austin is, a lot of the notes that I gave him, he followed them. Look, they are plenty of people who would be fake with you. I'm gonna be honest. I see the top. >> You don't see the blouse? Anthony is not crazy about the lace. He said, "It looks like dead white lady." Um-- >> I think that, if he edits, he will be a viable candidate to win Project Runway All Stars. >> Thank you, Tatiana. >> Mwah, mwah. >> That was intense. >> The corners are gonna be a biatch. >> Yeah, let's do a band. >> I mean, I just want it to lay, like, perfectly. No pressure. Work is never done until those models step foot on the runway. Man, this is such a, like, train wreck, I don't even know what to do. >> I think that Mondo has become sort of a little scattered about how to approach this final challenge. >> What are you doing? >> Trying to make it through. >> I feel you. >> Michael. >> Either way you still get your pony. >> Pressure is really on now. Oh, my neck. >> We only have two hours tomorrow? >> I think so. >> So little time. >> I think it looks like crap. Like, there's so much to do. I have the sixth look to cut. I have a jacket to make. I have all the alterations. There's a lot to do. >> 15 minutes. >> This alone is cute, but it's not a finale--an awesome Scarlett finale wedding gown. Sorry. I hope--I pray that I can manage to pull this one off. >> It's so scary to be so close to the final because you can instantly lose it all on one bad look. It's scary. >> Tomorrow--it's our last day before the big finale. So you know what, I expect to work like my life is coming to an end, which it feels like it is. >> Hey, guys, that's it. It's time to stop working. >> Let's go. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> Let's get this party started. >> I really want to see how he's gonna pull that out of his ass. >> We didn't finish as much as I was hoping for. >> How are you feeling about tomorrow? >> Oh, God, I want to win. >> We arrive back into the workroom. It's our last day before the big finale. >> I have so much work to do, a lot--a lot of--lot of work to do. I was almost thinking if I had, like, extra time-- >> Ha! >> I'm very grateful for Mila's help, but we didn't finish as much as I was hoping for. I'm feeling very anxious. >> Should I do, like, a couple of little-- >> Yeah, you can do tucks. >> Pleats, tucks? >> Don't take, like, a million hours on it. >> No, I know. >> Designers. >> Hi, Joanna. >> Your 24-hour help is now over. Quick hug. >> Bye. >> And I wanna come and chat to these guys on their own. >> Be good. >> It's been regal. >> Thank you so much. >> You're welcome. >> See you later, good luck. >> Thank you for all your help. >> Austin, how are you? >> Wonderful. >> This looks like a wedding. >> This is going to be a wedding. >> Oh, it is going to be a wedding. What's that huge skirt over there? >> This is just the foundation petticoat for this, which has not been done. But it's gonna be just, like, glam--total red carpet gown. >> How are you persuading the judges you're really pushing it? >> Um... I think by-- just I mean, I think that this outfit honestly is, like, something I've never seen before. >> All right, well, you've got till the end of the day. Use every single moment. And, you know, listen, I wish you the best of luck, Austin. >> Thank you. >> Best of luck. You've worked really hard for this. >> Thanks, Joanna. Thanks so much. >> Mondo, hi. >> Hi, Joanna. >> Let's get this party started. What's the story? >> This whole process has driven me a little crazy. >> Right. >> And so I came up with this concept of therapy. So I start out with this really cool little skirt. >> Right. >> With this laminated raffia. And then we go into this kind of jersey top. >> I like this 'cause it has such a sense of humor about it. Well, use the rest of the time that you have wisely. I think it looks really coherent, and it's strong. And I cannot wait to see it on the runway. All right, good luck, Mondo. >> Thank you, Joanna. Thank you. >> Michael. >> Hi. >> I would know this was "A," from you, and "B," that it's clearly part of the same collection. >> I wanted to do my take on African safari. >> Right. >> But still keeping it in a resort field. >> And it's interesting you've chosen resort because resort has come out-- I mean, it's a third of the clothes sold now, so that's a very commercial decision. >> This is the sixth look. This is the patent leather that I used in the miss piggy challenge. >> Right. >> That trimmed off the bow. >> Okay, so how are you feeling about tomorrow? >> Oh, God, I want to win. I just feel like these are clothes that women would want to wear, and I feel good about it. >> Well, you look in very good shape. I will see you tomorrow, come. >> See you tomorrow. >> Hello, L'Oreal Paris. >> Austin, how are you? >> Johnny! >> It's good to see you again. >> Johnny Lavoy is here to help create the runway look. Sort of like a really exaggerated ringlet curl. >> Yeah. >> Almost how the Hasidic gentlemen do. >> If you--the focus is on the front, I think it would have more of an impact. >> I have this idea of these women that are a little unkempt. Crimp her here and there just to give it lots of volume. >> She has a great head of hair for that. >> It's very African safari, Serengeti. So kind of tribal, effortless hair. >> But yet it's going to still look polished and beautiful. >> Yeah. Well, good luck. See you guys later. >> Thank you, good luck to you too. >> Thank you. >> Ugh, my kingdom for a seamstress. >> I'm probably a bit more scared about Austin's collection rather than Mondo's. It looks like there's been seven to eight months put into that collection. There's good stuff there. >> Mondo, one half-hour. >> Thanks, girl. Now be gone. Austin's collection-- I don't get it. He has a couple looks in his collection that are true Austin Scarlett, but some of them are risky for him. >> Having a glamour excitement fit. Mondo's collection--it's nice, I mean, very frantic. >> Hey, guys, ready to go? No. Can we just spend the night? >> Oh, what a day, what a day, what a day. Tomorrow is our big day. >> That was intense. >> Are you finished? >> No. >> No? >> I'm just thinking about how much I do really, really want the prize, how much I feel that I have earned it. >> You definitely know how to cut a beautiful dress. >> Right now it's hideous, but you're gonna turn it into something fabulous. >> I think-- >> Aren't you, Austin? >> I am. >> It looks fresh and classic. >> I'm enchanted by your dress. >> You're a star, man. >> If I win this, I'll be able to take all those prizes and make them grow ten times. >> I feel like this is my time. I feel like this needs to happen in order for me to really move forward and accomplish what I've set out to do. >> I think it's amazing that you got all this from what you found on the street. >> I love the fabric choice for this. I just think the kind of character she is is played up brilliantly in this. >> I just said, "wow!" >> I love this. >> I would die for this outfit. >> I can't wait any longer. >> Tomorrow should be exciting though, right? >> I can't wait. I really can't wait. This is all I've ever wanted. And it's so close. >> You took the project in a slightly more sophisticated direction. >> It looks like a prison for Kermie. >> You are the envy of every designer in this room because you work so fast. >> Michael, you got to call me after the show. >> You're like the official designer to the stars. >> I want it. I want this so bad. >> Cheers. >> To final three. >> The final three. And tomorrow is the big day.
