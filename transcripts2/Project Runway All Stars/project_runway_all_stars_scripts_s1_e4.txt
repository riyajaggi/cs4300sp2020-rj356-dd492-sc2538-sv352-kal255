 >> I'm going to get to design a dress for a Muppet. >> Do you think I can sex up Miss Piggy? >> It's tacky. >> I'm getting a bit of a nightgown vibe from this. >> If it comes to evening wear, I'm going to give you a [bleep] showstopper. >> How does a pig feel about wearing a giraffe print? >> Oh, my gosh.

 ♪ >> This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I love it! >> You took the project to a slightly more sophisticated direction. >> It looks like a present for Kermie. The winning designer... is Michael. >> I'm so thrilled. [Laughs] >> I wanted to create that happiness Miss Piggy has brought to my children. >> It wasn't a happy pink. >> I don't know if it's moi. >> Gordana, you're out. 13 of the best designers from Project Runway are back. And this time the competition is tougher than ever. Each week, their skills are tested to the limit as they compete for the biggest prize in Runway history. Who will be cut? And who will have it all sewn up? This is Project Runway All Stars. The winner of Project Runway All Stars will sell their merchandise within an exclusive boutique at select Neiman Marcus stores and on Neimanmarcus.com. The winner will also get a spread in Marie Claire magazine and a position as guest editor for one year... $100,000 in technology and office space from HP and Intel, a sewing and embroidery studio provided by Brother International, and a cash prize of $100,000 courtesy of L'Oreal Paris. Project Runway All Stars 1x04 Good Taste Tastes Good Original Air Date on January 26, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == >> Congratulations, Michael. [Cheers and applause] >> Winning last week's challenge does not not give me confidence that I will always be in the top or, you know, always be safe. >> You were excited to win, I heard you were jumping up and down. >> I was, I jump up and down every time I win. >> He tried to do the splits. >> I know that the pressure's on me to deliver something, like, amazing again. I think I'm really feeling that. >> Let's go. [Upbeat pop music] ♪ >> You are four challenges in and we have ten designers remaining in the competition. >> The competition is getting very competitive. This is Project Runway All Stars and everybody is so good here. >> This week's challenge is all about taste. Good taste comes in many forms, but it has to start somewhere. Why not be inspired by taste itself? Your challenge is to create a tasteful outfit inspired by the colors and flavors of a seriously tasty dessert, gelato. Please welcome l'arte del gelato. [Applause] >> A gelato-slinging cherub-- what's this all about? >> You'll each pick a flavor and you'll also receive a swatch for color reference. >> Some of the flavors are written in a way that I don't really know what--what it's gonna taste like or look like. Fruits of the forest? You know, I don't know what that is. >> Michael, you won last week's Miss Piggy challenge, so you get to go first. >> Great. I knew I wanted grapefruit. >> [Laughs] >> Bam. I was really hoping for something more of, like, a Ruby red color grapefruit. But I thought this color was just really beautiful also. >> Michael gets to pick who goes next. I know how this cookie's about to crumble. >> Mondo. >> I'm going to have my cantaloupe and eat it too. I'm going to choose Mila. >> [Squeaks] I choose milk and sour cherries. This is, like, milky white and red, two colors that I love together. I choose April. >> Yay. I did kind of hope that nobody would take blueberry. >> Fruit of the forest is still available. That fabric swatch was, like, this kind of yummy deep red color. >> I'm just really happy that passion fruit is still left. >> Vanilla Madagascar. >> I choose green tea. >> My eye is on kiwi from the beginning. >> Well, go grab it, Kara. It's yours. >> [Laughter] >> I'm kind of [bleep], you know? I got my chocolate with cayenne pepper, you know. I really did feel like the kid in the park that their little cone dropped. You know, and their little ice cream fell off. >> Our guest judge this week is here to tell you more about your challenge. Please welcome one of the most famous women in fashion. She's the President of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. >> [Gasps] Oh, my God. >> Diane Von Furstenberg. [Cheers and applause] >> Oh, my God, this is so exciting. >> Hi. >> Michael, he's, like, hyperventilating. He's, like, practically crying. >> Hi, everybody. >> Diane Von Furstenberg is a very big deal. >> Welcome to the show. >> Thank you. >> She is the queen of international ready-to-wear fashion. >> Well, designers, you do not have much time for this challenge. This is the fastest in Project Runway history. >> You only have six hours. >> From pattern construction to cutting to fitting to alterations to finishing the garment. >> I have six hours to show her my best work? >> So it's all about how quickly you can realize something, and how you were inspired by it. Just go for it. Thank you and good luck. >> Thank you. >> We'll be back here for this week's runway in just six hours' time. >> What the [bleep] am I going to make in six hours? [Electronic music] ♪ >> It's sketch time. In a roundabout way, I kind of know what I want to do. I want to do this oversized, like, silky drape dress with ruched sleeves to make it look gorgeous. >> Diane Von Furstenberg is going to be judging and I cannot disappoint that woman. It's got to be right. >> I'm not going to try anything new or take major risks, because I really just need to get something done. >> Mini Mood is set up in our designer lounge. >> Oh, my God! >> There's tons of fabric. >> I already have this design in my head. I need black jersey. And this Mood doesn't have black jersey. So I'm screwed. I have to start a new idea over, and I have to start a new idea quickly, because I don't have any time. >> Five minutes, everyone. That includes you, Mondo. >> Definitely want to work with colors. I definitely have to include the chocolate. But it's not about the chocolate, it's really about the flavor. Chocolate-y, a little spicy, and then it's this furnace fire. Guys, time's up. >> Are you serious? I don't get to buy as much fabric as I want. It's my own fault. I should have time-managed my experience in mini Mood. Oh, no. Shucks. [Ripping fabric] >> We have six hours and I'm just dying. >> I think maybe I could make a pair of leggings in six hours, but a whole entire outfit? >> I know the whole entire room is stressing and wondering what are they going to do. To me, it's not a big deal. >> I have clients who need things done in, like, 45 minutes to an hour. Just got to deliver. >> It's pretty, and I know where you're going to go with that. And I expect you to have another "ta-da" moment. >> The voila. >> Voila. >> The six-way stretch choir robe with two seams? Yeah, I know. So easy a chimpanzee could do it. >> Kara? >> Yeah, yeah? >> Are you feeling Madagascar? >> It feels like the beach. >> Yeah, it feels like the beach, it feels slightly tribal and African, but it still has a little glitz. >> I get my little color story together. Kind of seeing my dress come together in my head. I've got to make sure that it's a color palette that is chic, sophisticated, and reads well. >> Well, why not do, like, a Willy Wonka thing? When the girl eats the candy that gives her--you know, "Violet's turning Violet." >> I think April, she's just gonna need to soften it up, or play more with colors. And it's got to just be a little bit more versatile. >> I figured out how to do this on the last challenge, so I'm hoping it continues to work. >> [Laughs] >> [Laughs] What are you laughing at? Everyone is really just going completely crazy. >> [Laughs] This is crazy. >> Like horrified, "I'm going to die." [Mock weeping] Like you have a gun at your head. >> She works wonders with black and white fabric. So to see her do her take with the sour cherry and the milk, it's extremely refreshing. >> I do want the world to see that I don't only work in black and white, but also that there is a softer side to my design aesthetic. >> It's coming together really well until... I laid the fabric on the floor. And I don't know how, but some way, it's about 8 1/2 inches shorter on one side. I measured wrong. >> This skirt didn't have a pattern, so I'm thinking, you know, "what?" Like, this is such a "make it work" moment. And I'm sewing, and I'm sewing, and I'm sewing and running, and cutting and running. I literally have sewed as if this was the last thing I was going to sew in my life. [Laughs] >> Now my bobbin totally doesn't work. >> Ooh, [bleep], the white woman is flipping out back there. >> Normally a fashion designer would never be in the predicament of having to create something in six hours. >> Damn, I wish I had a cocktail right now. >> I have never in my life tried to power through a dress so quickly. You don't want Diane to be disappointed. >> I don't know if I'm going to be able to pull it off, to be honest. [Bleep] >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> How can you have a fashion moment if you're staying with what you're comfortable with? >> That is your dream in a hot glue stick. >> I--I'm like, ashamed. >> You're sucking up to Diane Von Furstenberg. >> This week's challenge is to create a look inspired by a flavor of gelato. >> We only have six hours for the challenge. >> Hi, designers. >> Hi, Joanna. >> Don't stop working. I know this is the fastest challenge in Project Runway history. I've bought you all a little snackeroo to keep you sugared up. And this is the chocolate and cayenne, who has the choc--okay, I'm coming to you first, Kara. >> My whole thing isn't actually in the workroom. >> Okay. >> My key focus is really to create this silhouette that, like, embodies this flavor. And so I've done numerous layers that go from neutral into, like, a fiery red. >> Oh, right. I mean, you were under pressure a bit last week time-wise. >> Yes, yes. >> This week, you think you've got it nailed? >> I think so. >> Good. April. >> Hi, Joanna, how are you? >> Hi, refreshment. >> Thank you, I appreciate it. >> Little boost. You're working with blueberries, right? Okay, so you've been working under tremendous pressure of deadline. What are the tricks of the trade? >> I think you really have to stick with what you're comfortable with. >> How can you have a fashion moment if you're staying with what you're comfortable with? >> Well, I am working in color. >> Two thoughts: You say you're working with color. Here's the color and then you've covered the color up. Now what about this? None of this is finished. It's just clean-cut, right? >> No, no. >> I definitely see an issue with the hem. It was short on one side where you could see the lining and longer on the other side. >> All right, good luck. Cantaloupe gelato to keep going. >> Thank you so much. >> Okay, so I want to ask you something that readers ask me all the time. How on earth do you accessorize? Because the minute you put this black belt on, it changes the shape of the dress. Also it sort of pulls it together. >> With this one, you can make it more fun or you can make it more elegant. >> So this is going to be like this, right? >> Yes, yes, ma'am. >> Okay, 'cause this would also make it suitable for evening too, wouldn't it? >> Right, for evening, you can put it with a gold pump or anything to go with your belt. It's ready to go. >> Well, I can't wait to see the finished object. Good luck. >> All right, thank you so much. >> How are you going to speak to Diane Von Furstenberg's request that you make this as creative as possible? >> I think this is very creative given the time restraints. And also I maintained style as well as taste. >> Course it would be vanilla with Madagascar for you. >> Well... >> What is the Madagascar bit? >> I was thinking of doing this whole blouson drapery. >> Don't channel the wedding thing, channel the fabulousness. >> The flavor's kiwi. It's going to be a wrap skirt. >> If you're doing a wrap skirt, doesn't that mean you're sucking up to Diane Von Furstenberg, queen of the wrap dress? >> No, because it's not really-- honestly, the--the wrap is pretty much only because of, uh, the time constraints. >> Tell me about your flavor. >> It is milk and sour cherries. >> So this is a pretty literal interpretation. >> I do not like what Mila has designed. It looked like a color-blocked Christmas ornament disaster. >> So remember, remember, remember this week's challenge. Fabulousness, extravagance. Show us how creative you are. >> Okay. >> Now what is this shade of pink? >> Grapefruit. >> Okay, now I have to tell you, and this may come as no surprise, that you are the envy of every designer in this room because you work so fast. What is your secret? >> Just literally been sewing since I was probably about ten years old. >> I mean, are you gluing instead of-- >> Nothing's glued. >> Make sure it stands out. >> Stands out, huh? >> When you've got a paler color, sometimes, it's harder. All right, good luck. >> Thank you. >> Okay, designers, I'm off. Remember, the clock is ticking. You've got very little time left. Your models are on their way. And I will see you soon. >> Thank you. >> Bye. [Funky music] ♪ >> The first time we've ever got six hours. >> Why six hours? >> Six hours? >> This has nothing to do with being a talented designer. This has something to do with being a fast seamstress. >> After Joanna leaves, I have a ton of work to do. I mean, you can't just glue stick [bleep] together. >> That is liquid thread on that dress. >> This is liquid imagination. I'm, like, ashamed to even admit it, but I actually used a glue gun. >> That is your dream in a hot glue stick. >> That print was perfect. It's very vibrant. And it's very me. >> Kelly is, like, a simple dress. I don't get passion fruit from that at all. >> Finish the neck. I'm happy with the way the design's coming out with the blouse. I just need the time to finish it. >> I feel like Rami's look is of questionable taste. It looks really garish, like a lime explosion. [Fabric ripping] >> I'm really trying to send something down the runway that is unexpected from me. >> I love Mondo's caftan. But it is a caftan. It's a dress that I designed when I was in college. >> My model comes in. The dress does not fit her. I have to add two triangle panels to the back. I realize that I don't have enough fabric to make the dress longer. >> All right, get out. We need to--I need to get back to work. >> Mwah, thank you for all your help. [Rock music] ♪ Only reason that I ain't flipping out, y'all-- that don't get your garment finished. Only thing that I've had to change is my skirt. I'm going from a more pencil design to a more flirty, Fuller-moving skirt. >> I like this though. >> This is really sheer still. With two layers, I thought it would be enough, but you're going to be able to see all the going to be able to see all the parts. Middle. I feel like half the designers are completely done with theirs and the other half are still running around like chickens with their heads cut off. >> Oh, sorry, I just need-- >> At that point, I really didn't think it would accomplish anything to sort of get into some altercation, because we're all frantic. >> Thank you. >> I gave her the look of death. >> There's three hours left, and this competition could change my life. And I'm [bleep] fighting for that [bleep]. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> I don't have time to do the zipper, and I sew my model into it. All is fair in love and fashion. >> Oh, man, these proportions are a little off. >> We all have just, like, two hours to finish up our outfits. We're all frantic. It's definitely one of the most stressful challenges thus far. >> The last two hours of the workroom, I'm really just delirious and kind of just winging it. >> There's absolutely not a second to waste on the "woulda, coulda, shouldas," but just what I can do with what I have access to. >> Diane Von Furstenberg will be our judge. >> No way. >> Yeah. >> My model came in, and I fit her, and it was perfect. By now, I'm pretty familiar with her body, so it's pretty easy for me to get it right on. >> I'm particularly impressed with Mondo's cantaloupe. I think that it really does embody the feel of cantaloupe, but in a very kind of modern, abstract way. Abstract way. But it's so cantaloupe. Accessories. I usually make my own. But I think I'm going to use the Neiman Marcus wall this time around. I like this bangle. >> They had a lot of cute stuff today. >> This is a ten... Which I'm excited about. Perfect. >> We all want the best accessories. I do love these. Yeah, those are definitely the way to go. >> Cool. >> One hour! >> I have to send my model now to the L'Oreal hair and makeup team. I just want, like, a very chic chignon kind of thing in the back. >> I want to do, like, a really messy bun. It's kind of a shabby chic look. >> I want, like, it to be a braid that goes like this into, like, a sloppy bun. >> Cool. >> Yes. >> So you like glossy? >> I'd like a black-red lip, very fresh, very youthful. >> I just want a, like, a really clean, fresh face. >> Vanilla Madagascar. >> Vanilla Madagascar. Like, rich lady on resort. Because how short the dress is. I should have gotten more fabric. It's just crazy. >> Oh, man, these proportions are a little off for me. >> I tell you, her model is a rail, and she had her look like a pregnant cupcake. That's not the business. >> Guys, you have ten minutes. Zipper, and I sew my model into it. All is fair in love and fashion. >> The last two minutes in the workroom, I just want to do the runway and just be done with this one. >> The bottom is not completely symmetrical. It's just not fitting the way it should. I can only do so much, and then it's really out of my hands. >> Guys, it's time to go to the runway. >> Let's go. >> All right. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> It's just all over the place. >> There was no passion in this dress. >> It's just not flattering. >> You know you've missed. >> Welcome back to the runway. Seems like I just saw you a few hours ago. [Laughter] As it's been said, on Project Runway, one day you're in and the next you're out. Tonight, one of you will be going home. This week's challenge was the fastest in Project Runway history. You only had six hours to design a look inspired by the gelato flavor you chose. Let's meet the judges. First we have designer and co-founder of Marchesa, Georgina Chapman. >> Hi. All: Hi. >> Next we have one of the most famous names in fashion... Isaac Mizrahi. >> Hi, kids. >> And we have the first of two guest judges. She's one of the most respected names in fashion, the iconic Diane Von Furstenberg. >> Hi. [Applause] >> And last but not least, one of the hottest models in the business, Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr. >> Hi, guys. [Applause] >> And Miranda will wear the winning designer's look to an industry event. >> Having Miranda Kerr wear your look is great publicity. >> Good luck and have a great show. [Up-tempo dance music] ♪ >> My mouth waters for a slice of cantaloupe. This is this drape-y kimono. And I think the judges will recognize that I am going recognize that I am going outside my own box. She looks like a dream realized. When Diane Von Furstenberg really likes something, she looks at the designer and kind of winks at them. Diane does not wink at me. She's got this really vibrant glow about her. I'm hoping the judges notice it's very cute, flirty. And that's who my clients are. To see my design. Because you don't have time to, like, sit and look back. And that was my moment. And she looked like a rich, beautiful girl going out to lunch with her girlfriends. And so I'm happy with the way it looks. Gorgeous, and easy breezy. I'm very tasteful, so I think I've got this one covered. Fantastic, I think that it's something that's super relatable to my client. And I think that it's something that Diane Von Furstenberg just gave me a thumbs up for. The colors are just gorgeous. Isaac and Diane are definitely reacting to this. And I'm thinking, "I get it, of course they get it." You want to lick this dress because you get it. I felt like that is liquid gelato moving on the runway. And she looks gorgeous. She looks flawless, effortless, exactly how I wanted her to look. The color of blueberry. And I really like this silhouette. I think it's dark and it works. I like the look. I wish the skirt was longer. I hope the judges just realize that we only had six hours for this. Are my signature. I want to be able to show that. That's why I'm here on the runway is to showcase who I am as a designer. Name, please step forward. Austin. Rami. Jerell. Kenley. Congratulations, you guys are safe. Your designs will keep you in the competition. Well done. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Designers, let's bring out your models. [Suspenseful music] ♪ Kara... >> Hi. >> You had chocolate and cayenne pepper gelato. Can you tell us about your inspiration and your design for your dress? >> I felt like it was layers upon layers of flavor. And I tried to bring all the colors and the experiences that I felt into this dress. And right at the end, I had this pop of cayenne pepper which, for me, was like this red. >> You're so passionate when you talk, and I just--I couldn't quite get the passion in the dress. I think the colors are letting you down slightly. >> You did a beautiful job to explain your inspiration. That moved me. But the dress itself doesn't. >> I like the fact that you said it has all the different layers. The only thing that I found, personally, was that I'm not so much a fan of ruffles. >> The dress is very cute. I think the explanation is wonderful. But it's just not flattering. And it's not just from the side. >> Actually, the back detail, if we could see it, is really sweet. I like that, felt very summery. Yet when you're getting the side profile, she's looking like she's hiding a bump. >> I also wrote down "pregnant." >> And the minute the word "pregnant" comes up, you know you've--you've missed. >> Anthony, you had green tea gelato. >> Watching my gelato melt in my hands on top of my cone kind of served as the primary inspiration for my look. >> Before you explained your inspiration of ice cream melting, I liked the dress much less. >> I like that you took a creative approach to your design. But I think you went a little too conceptual. Instead of coming across as amazing, it got a little bit messy. >> I love the skirt. And I love the concept. You could see it, it's darker and then it melts. Turn around? >> Maybe if you'd lost the back panels, you would have had a more flattering silhouette. >> I definitely agree. Like, a little more simplicity in the back would've been great. >> Mila, milk with sour cherry gelato. >> Just wanted to create something that evoked that-- the milkiness and the color of milk versus the stark color of a cherry. >> I think this says cherry ice cream so much, so clearly. >> Wow. >> I agree with you, Isaac. I really like this dress as well. I think it was a very creative approach with the lines and the layers, and I like the way that that came across. >> It's beautiful and the design is nice. But it kind of looks like it was done in little time. That was my problem. >> I think it was a very ambitious dress, given the time, with all that seaming which you've done very well. So I really congratulate you on that. And I think all that lightness of summer that I'm getting from your design is rather distracted for me by the weight of everything you've added to it. >> I think that this is a dress that looks like it's easy to wear, and I like that, 'cause I like things that I can just throw on and... You know, you don't have to think too much about it. I really liked it. I like the color choice, and I think that it flows well when she was walking. >> Thank you. >> Michael, grapefruit gelato. >> I really wanted to do something that I know I could finish. I wanted to do something beautiful, because, I have to tell you, Diane, you're, like, one of my really big idols. >> I love the dress. I think it's a great dress. I'm not mad about the color. Grapefruit can be very pale and smooth, but there is a tartness to it that I think is missing. >> My concern, again, was the color, but if you say that was the color of the ice cream-- I just wasn't getting grapefruit. I'm getting more like a nude-y tone. >> I think it's beautiful, I think it's beautifully draped, I think it's very fluid. Turn around. Yeah. Michael, you got to call me after this show. [Laughter] >> April, you had blueberry gelato. >> I wanted to create something that was light, like the taste of the gelato. It wasn't very strong, but it had these bits that you would bite into and taste the blueberry. >> Is it black over a purple? Is that what I'm seeing? >> It's a dark purple over this bright purple. >> You see, that gives a really nice read on the eye. I just think you were too ambitious, doing this corset. Because my eye is just going straight there, and it's just all over the place. >> When she first came out, she made a big impact, I thought. The length is right. >> Turn around. >> The color is great. Well, that, of course, I was going to get to. The back is--the back is really scary. The back is scary and the belt is scary, right? >> Yeah. >> And the earrings are scary. >> The effect of the two fabrics, that was very nice. But then it went from being very nice to a little bit Halloween spider thing. It just didn't look like it was a finished product. >> You have very interesting ideas. But sometimes in the translation, I find it's not coming through clearly. >> Just--let's see what it looks like without the belt. >> It's funny, 'cause I usually don't style a lot. >> Look how much better that is. >> So much better. >> It definitely does look better without the belt. >> So, Mondo. >> Hi. >> You had cantaloupe. >> This would be like the rind. This is like the green. It's like my loose interpretation of the actual cantaloupe. >> I think it's great, because I think it does look like a cantaloupe. Turn around. >> I love it that it's teamed with flats. And the back is absolutely to die for. Kind of adds a little sexiness to it. >> You know, it's funny, because I'm looking at these colors and these fabrics, and I'm like, they shouldn't go together. Yet somehow, it does work. >> I love a caftan. And I think that sometimes, with a caftan, you can--they can not flatter your figure. I think this caftan really flatters the figure. The only thing I didn't really love about it is the bright color orange, which you went for that in the taste, and I applaud you for that. I think it's great. >> I wish there was more of her body on immediate impact. When she turns around, it kind of saves the thing. >> Well, that was clearly a lot of work, designers. Well done. We're now going to deliberate, and we'll call you back. You can leave the runway. Thank you. Low scores. Let's talk about our low scores. Let's start with Anthony. >> The ambition was so big to do, a beautiful balenciaga with the whole thing. And when you do something like that, you know, it's got to be perfect. Otherwise it looks amateur. >> If the skirt had been in the same color, I don't think we would have gone to the waist as much. I think it would have been a more complete look. >> I think Kara designs sweet clothing, and I think she was very stuck on this. She chose the chocolate cayenne swatch and she just could not get her mind out of it. And I think that her interpretation was great when she said it, but it was very literal, the layers and how she tasted it, and she had to make herself figure out how to work with a chocolate brown. Which--what's wrong with brown? >> Well, there's plenty wrong with chocolate brown if it's not good. And you know, that dress was-- it wasn't offensive in any particular way. >> It was to me, it looked like a maternity dress. >> It didn't look amateurish. It's not flattering at the waist, that was really the only thing I personally could object to it. >> There was an intention there that I think was very good. I'm with you on the color. I'm not all there and-- >> Mm-mm. Really, after a while, is she an all star? >> And then we have April. >> The colors were pretty. It was fresh and it was youthful in its approach. I think she needs a little more confidence in who she is. And I don't think we got a true vision from her. >> For me, it would look like a little piece of Halloween, yeah. >> I wish she had gone with that, that could have been really fresh and exciting. >> That's right. >> Let's talk about our top scorers. Let's start with Michael. >> Michael is a great draper. The style was really beautiful. >> It's not my favorite fabric, but I love the way it was very floaty and it was timeless, and she looked like a goddess. >> I love the movement of it, I love the flow of it. It's also like something that-- I don't know what, like you've seen before, something with a-- there's something about it that's too on the nose. >> I think the profile, the draping on the arm, was so beautiful. But the fabric threw me, 'cause it didn't conjure up grapefruit to me. I know he said that was the color, but it sort of read fleshy, and I-I wanted to see something fresh and vibrant. And I think even a satin faced georgette would have been better. >> So let's talk about Mila. >> I thought it was a dress that you could wear very easily. You can just throw it on. I did think that the styling was a little heavy with the shoes and the belt. >> I got the flavor of the ice cream from that dress. That was my favorite dress. >> Really? >> Yeah, I really liked it. [Laughter] >> I really liked it too. >> Something, you know--I really adore easy clothes. >> I don't particularly like when you see the red through the white. I think it conjures up a strange color. >> Let's go to Mondo. >> I like the color. It's gorgeous. The back detail--the way it came down into that "v"-- was really nice. >> I actually liked the literal element of the sleeves that looked like the cantaloupe rind. >> I didn't find it sexy. She was covered from head to toe, and I didn't like the bright orange. >> You are the one who is wearing orange, aren't you? [Laughter] >> It sounds as though it's between Michael and Mondo. >> Uh-huh. It's a tough one. >> It really is. >> 'Cause the inspiration--you could say Mondo is right on it. If you--it was on the cover of a magazine and the magazine was called cantaloupe, you got it. >> I think Michael's dress is more creative than Mondo's. >> The only thing I actually just thought about, wearing Michael's dress, you know-- especially now I'm breastfeeding--without a bra? >> Little bit of tape. >> You know what I'm saying, though? >> She's totally on a personal angle here. >> I see why you ladies relate to the thing of Mondo's. There is a stylishness to it. They're both award-winning thoughts, I have to say. >> So we've made our decision. >> Yeah. >> Okay, let's bring the designers back out. [Dramatic music] ♪ Designers, to create an outfit in just six hours, that's pretty incredible. Job well done. One of you will be named this week's winner. And one of you will be going home tonight. >> Designers, one of you will be named this week's winner. And one of you will be going home tonight. Mila... You're safe. You can leave the runway. Michael... Mondo... One of you will win this week's challenge and have your design showcased by Miranda. And that winning designer is... Michael. >> [Gasps] Oh, my God. >> Yay. >> Oh, my God. >> Congratulations, Michael. >> Miranda, oh, my God, you're going to look great, girl. I'm just telling you right now. >> I can't wait to wear it. >> So, Miranda, are you excited? Where are you going to wear Michael's dress? >> It's such a beautiful dress. I could wear it to so many different things. >> Come to Palm Springs. We'll hang out, and you can wear it there, it'd look great there. >> Palm Springs, that would be nice. >> Congratulations, Michael. >> Thank you. >> You are through to next week and that much closer to the grand prize. >> Thank you, thank you, judges. Thank you, guys. >> You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. My phone's going to ring off the hook now. >> You're like, now... >> Jesus. >> Official designer to the stars. >> It's a whole different level for me. Project Runway All Stars is a dream come true. It really is. >> You know what, Mondo, we loved your dress too. >> Thank you. >> Especially Diane. >> It was close. >> All of us girls wanted to wear that dress. Congratulations, Mondo. You're safe and you can leave the runway. >> Thank you. I think, at this point, the judges are recognizing that I have something else to show. Maybe I missed the mark this week, but I'll be back again next week. >> Anthony... You're safe, you can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Bye, honey. >> April and Kara... One of you will be in and one of you will be out. April... We understand you only had six hours, but your dress was poorly constructed. You need to learn that when something's not working, you just need to move on. Kara... You're a passionate designer. But there was no passion in this dress. And we just couldn't get past that maternity look. That maternity look. Kara... I'm sorry, April. That means you're out. Kara, you can leave the runway. >> Thank you. I want you to know I'm really passionate about what I do. >> You are. >> We can see that. >> I'm sorry. >> Oh! Oh! I am relieved! >> [Sighs] >> April, thank you so much for being part of All Stars. You really have amazing potential. >> Thanks, I appreciate it. Thanks for the opportunity. >> And we wish you all the best. >> [Sniffling] Thank you. >> You wouldn't be here if you weren't an all star. >> Thank you. Bye. >> Good luck. >> Obviously I wanted to come here and win, but you can't predict those things. I just look at every opportunity as an experience and grow from that. >> I love you. >> I was so happy to meet you. >> I'm not going to, like, give up. I have a degree in this and I've worked really hard. And I'm 22, so I have a lot of time. Going forward, I'm going to expand my brand and keep doing what I love to do. >> Next on Project Runway All Stars... This week's challenge is to find a muse to inspire a fashion-forward look. But there is an All Stars twist. >> What? >> Hold on a second. >> Can I ask you guys a question? >> My name's Austin Scarlett. >> I think you're gorgeous. >> I will do whatever I have to do. I need those shorts right off your back. Ladies, that's how you get a man. >> You haven't actually got a challenge under your belt yet. >> It's so insane how she's, like, in everybody's business. >> Are you worried that you might have peaked? >> It looks the opposite of sexy. >> It's too confusing. >> I feel like she's walking around without her skirt on. >> She looks like someone that should be in The Lion King. >> Visit mylifetime.com to learn more about the fashion seen on tonight's show. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
