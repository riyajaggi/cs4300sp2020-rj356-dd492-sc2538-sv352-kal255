 >> I've got six hours to save the world. >> The whole entire room is stressing. >> You are the envy of every designer in this room, because you work so fast. >> I've just got to deliver. >> How can you have a fashion moment if you're staying with what you're comfortable with? >> I really just need to get something done. >> [Bleep].

 I hate this. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to pull it off. >> The back is absolutely to die for. >> I think it's a great dress. >> Michael, you got to call me after the show. [Laughter] >> The winning designer is... Michael. >> Oh, my God. >> I wanted to create something that was light, like the taste of the gelato. >> The back is scary and the belt is scary. >> And it's just all over the place. >> I'm sorry, April, that means you're out. 13 of the best designers from Project Runway are back. And this time competition is tougher than ever. Each week, their skills are tested to the limit, as they compete for the biggest prize in Runway history. Who will be cut, and who will have it all sewn up? This is Project Runway All Stars. The winner of Project Runway All Stars will sell their merchandise within an exclusive boutique at select Neiman Marcus stores and on Neimanmarcus.com. The winner will also get a spread in Marie Claire magazine and a position as guest editor for one year, $100,000 in technology and office space from HP and Intel, a sewing and embroidery studio provided by Brother International, and a cash prize of $100,000 courtesy of L'Oreal Paris. Project Runway All Stars 1x05 Clothes off Your Back Original Air Date on February 2, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == >> We walk quite the distance to see miss Angela waiting for us in the hot sun. >> Hi, designers. >> All: Hi. >> Welcome to Central Park. I thought it would be nice for you to get out of the house, get some fresh air and sunshine. >> Thank you. >> You've all been working so hard. >> Correct, ma'am. >> Are you ready for your next challenge? >> All: Yes. >> All right. This week's challenge is going to be about designers and their muse, and your challenge is to find a muse to inspire a fashion-forward look. It could be anyone--a tourist, a trendsetter, anyone. >> I'm looking around and I'm going, okay, um, how are we possibly going to make something interesting out of this, like, casual park attire? >> But there is an All Stars twist. You have to convince your muse to give you their clothes off their back. >> What? >> Hold on a second. A stranger is gonna give us their clothes? >> I think that this challenge is so amazing because I've taken so many daggers in this competition for having a personality, but it will be the fact that you have a personality that will allow you to succeed. >> Now, you have a budget of $150, and you can use this to convince your muse to give you their clothes off their back. And then the rest of money you can use to get fabric at Mood. >> Okay. This is definitely going to be a challenge, because, you know, I'm practically going to walk up to people and beg them for their clothes. We're in New York, so we know that New Yorkers don't take that [bleep] very well. >> Half of your look must come from your muse's clothing. >> Okay. >> But you all have HP cameras so that you can take a photograph and remember your muse's look. You guys want some good news? >> Yes. >> Yes, please. >> You have two days to do this challenge. [Cheering] I knew you'd be happy about that. >> Awesome. >> Good luck. I'll see you back on the runway with your fashion-forward looks. Off you go. >> All right, let's go. >> Oh, I'm gonna slip. >> You run like a girl. >> I do! Beg, borrow, steal, I will do whatever I have to do to get what I need to move forward. Oh, my God, you look amazing. >> Can I ask you guys a question? >> Excuse me, hi. >> I think you're gorgeous. I love your style. >> My name's Austin Scarlett. I'm a fashion designer. >> How are you? >> Good, how are you? >> Good. Nice to meet you. I'm Rami. >> I love your look. We're at the mercy of what we can find, and then, also, it's, like, can we actually get them to give us the clothes? Thank you. Well, I'm glad. >> All of a sudden, I've noticed Mila has gained a personality. Me having a personality is me just being Anthony l. Williams. Hi, how are you? >> I'm okay. >> I'm Anthony from Project Runway, and I am literally coming to take the clothes right off your back. I need your top, and I'm gonna remake it on the show, and I'm actually gonna make you my muse. Will you help me? >> I guess, but what would I wear? >> We have a white T-shirt to give you in return, and you can put your apron back on, then you cinch your waist, and you're all high-fashion all over again. >> Okay. >> You ready? What's your name? >> Mave. >> Mave, thank you. I'm Anthony. This woman just caught my eye when I initially saw her in this amazing floral print, colorful top, and I'm like, "I'm gonna make you my muse." >> I would have to buy your tank top off of you. Out of each ten people you ask, there's probably gonna be two or three people that were gonna be willing to give you something. >> Buy it off of me? I don't want to sell this. I love this tank top. >> Are you sure? >> Yeah, I'm sorry. >> That's okay. Thank you. Can I buy your T-shirt off of you? >> I really can't. >> Okay, girl. It's super cute, though. Enjoy it. >> We don't have a lot of money. >> Okay. >> I've really got to have this dress. >> Um, I don't know. I like this dress. >> I like it too. That's why you've got to work with me here. >> I'm sorry, but thank you. >> Oh, okay. I hate today's challenge. I really do. I don't like it. It's not fun. I wish I had more time and more people to approach in the park. >> There's a lot of people who are just like, "get the eff away from me, I don't want to talk to you," so I was mortified. >> Hello. Hi. I approached this very cool, young artist girl who had this very funky, sort of punk glam look. >> I finally see this cool girl, and she's wearing this really pretty silk black and white striped top. I'm a designer, and I would love for you to be my muse and take this actual shirt off your back for something. I'd love to offer you some money. >> How much? >> I have, like, $50. Is that enough? And I have something to give to you so you're not walking around with just a bra on. >> Yeah, let's do it. >> Oh, thank you so much. Can I get your picture? Thanks. Perfect. >> Will you be my muse? >> Yes, I will. >> All right, thank you. >> You're welcome. >> I could already envision sort of, like, a high-fashion version of this girl's look. You, I think, look fabulous. I love your style. I love the nails, the gold and the black. >> You better make this fabulous. >> Well, you're the inspiration, so it will be fabulous. You're fabulous. >> This is fabulous. What's your name? >> Grace. >> Grace, hi, I'm Mondo. I see this really, really cute girl. She has a great sense of style, and she has this really psychedelic, beautiful print. So I was wondering if I could buy the clothes off your back. >> Yes. >> Yes. Okay, good. Can I see that coat, please? >> You can't buy my coat. >> Let me--can I just look at it? Why--why--why are you so attached to this coat? >> I don't know. I just got it. >> What if I give you $50 for both of them? For this and that? >> I'll do it for $60. >> Okay, $60. Okay, good, good, good, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. >> Love your dress, love the stripes. I got to get a modern take. Would you be willing to part with your shirt? I can give you $20 for it. >> $20? >> $20. >> Would I get replacement clothing? >> I think it's pomegranate or raspberry or fuchsia or delicious. I don't know what you want to call it. >> I'd go for delicious. >> Delicious, so-- >> why don't you say "delicious" in your accent again? >> Delicious, delicious, delicious, delicious. >> Wow. >> And I've even got a hula-hoop dressing room for you and all that. >> Okay. >> Okay, cool, thank you. >> And it's gonna be with me. >> Right. >> If that makes any difference. >> That--that--that makes a difference. >> Here you go, baby. >> Take it off you, Bill. Come on. Whoo! >> Oh, stop. >> [Laughs] >> I'm so appreciative, and-- >> I'll strip for you, big man. >> That won't be necessary today, home boy, but thank you for the offer. >> $20, $40, $50. That's yours to keep. You won't get this back, but I promise you, it's gonna be turned into something awesome. When I saw her, I knew that she was the one. I was like... ♪ Ah ♪ And the sun was shining behind her. Chickens were hatching. Jesus came back. It was wonderful. >> Hi, hot white guy. How are you? I'm Anthony. What's your name? >> Diego. >> Diego? Nice to meet you. I need those shorts right off your back. I'm doing a show, and I need to take them and make them--redo 'em altogether. Take 'em off, honey. Take 'em off. Yay! >> Whoo! >> Back off, bitches! This one's mine! [Gasps] It's very funny. Some people are saying no, but all the men say yes. Oh! >> Are you sure? >> I'm sure! Take it off! Yes, honey! And all I can give you in return is a smile. Bye-bye. >> Whoo! >> Get the hell away! >> Oh, my God! >> No! No, no, no, no, no, no! >> Oh, I want him! >> Whoo! >> I'll give you something. You can put the hat over it. Please, please, please. I don't know about Anthony and him, but I got the guy's phone number. >> Ladies, that's how you get a man. >> Ooh! >> Lady Antoinetta is giving us life lessons. [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ >> We have 30 minutes to shop, and the remainder of our money to use on whatever you need to complete your look. >> And I'll compare 'em all when I'm done. Going into Mood, I naturally have a plan of action. >> That's pretty. >> I go straight to the wool crepes, and I find exactly what I'm looking for. >> Ten minutes. >> Okay. >> How you doing? 50% of the final outfit has to be made from things we get from the park. I'm using 100%. I bought no fabric from Mood, because I think that that is just kind of sitting your baby in a bear trap. Why would you do that? >> One yard of this. I was afraid that maybe I'll run out of money, but I actually had one penny left. >> All right, designers, time's up. >> I can't. My budget's $45. [Sighs] >> $105.90. >> And does that include the thread? >> No. >> It seemed like everyone was really running short on money. Kara asked if I had any extra money, if she could use it, but if I had any money extra, I absolutely would have given it. >> Can I give back a yard of fabric? It was kept to a minimum. Our budget was tight. It was just enough for just a little. >> How much do you need? >> I need $3.00. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> How are you gonna show me this as a designer? >> Somebody looked like they're coming to America. >> I'm not as inspired as I wanted to be, and I'm screwed. >> I think Michael's gonna give you-- >> This one? >> Yeah. >> Kara, I have a dollar. >> That would be amazing. >> Honey, can you give her whatever needs to complete her transaction out of my money? >> Here is your dollar. >> I've got three bucks from three of my fellow competitors, who I love. >> You know, I always give back to the community. [Laughs] >> We all help each other where we can. >> Does anybody have four cents? Just kidding. [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Cute. [Overlapping chatter] >> I think this is a really great challenge. We have to use somebody in New York City as a muse, but there's a twist. We need to use their clothes straight off of their back. >> I don't want to know where some of these stains came from. My first order of business is to attack these jeans. I need to basically make a guy's size 34 jean into a model size 2/4. >> My background is totally playing into this challenge. That's how I started designing and learning how to make patterns. I would go to thrift stores and buy a bunch of crap and, you know, take it home and rip it apart and see how it was constructed, and then turn it into something new for myself. >> Let's see here. I'm definitely excited about this whole challenge. I think it's really fun. I'm in love with my muse. She really is a muse in the true sense of the word. >> There she is. >> Are you making, uh, hot pants? >> Yeah, I thought it'd be fashion-forward, with a little cage jacket with the belt. I'm just getting started, but I know that I'm going to do separates. >> There's more fabric in those shorts. This is random fabric. >> No, it's a top going up under there as well. >> Oh, okay. >> No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. If I know how to do this, I know how to meet the requirements of the challenge. The challenge requires us to use 50% of the materials that we recovered from the street in our design. I have not completely chosen all of the fabrics. I don't know exactly how much other people got, but I got a lot of garments on the street. >> In the workroom, I'm totally stressed out. I've been playing with this crochet fabric, and I really can't get anywhere with it. I really want to use it, because I think it has some beautiful elements. I have to think about it. I just feel like I'm in a bad spot right now, 'cause I'm not as inspired as I wanted to be. >> Oh, that's pretty, Rami Kashou. >> You like? >> Love. >> All right, you guys, it's 11:00. Time to go. >> Actually, yeah, I'm starting to sew, but I haven't cut out all the pattern pieces yet. Thank you, Mondo. >> So this morning, we wake up. It's our second day of our sort of street-wear, muse of a city challenge, and we're all anxious to really sort of get started and--and create. >> So are you still doing, like, the belt and the chiffon and the crochet? >> Mm-hmm. I'm gonna do--I love--that's the idea that I like, the crocheted, little capped sleeve. >> Yeah, the cap. >> Yesterday, Michael was definitely feeling the pressure. I mean, coming off of two wins, he definitely has to keep up the momentum, and I think the pressures could be getting to him. >> So let's make passion. >> Do it. [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ >> You know how you have, like, a brainstorm... >> First. >> Well, yeah. I want one happening now. I don't know what I'm doing at this point. I'm not good with putting scraps together to come up with beauty. >> Okay, so you're getting ideas. >> Yeah, but if I don't like that little jacket, I can still use it as a top, as a top a little bit. I've moved from shorts to now I have pants. My jacket has gone from being a top to now a blouse, and possibly I have a cardigan. >> I made this top, and today is, like, a totally 180 for me. I just feel so much better. >> This time, I am going to be working on separates, 'cause I just think it would be cool to show the judges something different. >> Let 'em have it, honey. >> And let 'em have it. Being in the park yesterday, I saw a lot of exposed skin, so if you've got a great body, show it off in a way that, of course, is not slutty. >> Good morning, designers. >> Hi. >> Good morning. >> I cannot wait to find out how you got on on the streets of new York yesterday. It's my favorite place to look for inspiration, and I'm gonna come around and interrogate you all. Mondo. >> Hi there. >> I hate to interrupt you. >> It's okay. How you doing? >> Now, you have great street style. Tell me about this. Do you have photos of it? >> Uh, well, this is my muse. Her name's Grace. And so my fantasy for her is, like, Tokyo street-wear. >> Is this a challenge you could win? Because you haven't actually got a challenge under your belt yet, have you? And yet I think of street style as in your ballpark. >> I'm feeling good. It's just about getting this jacket done. I'm making priorities in what I need to finish first, and then just keep on knocking them out until it's done. >> Good. >> Cool, thank you. >> Okay, good luck. >> Bye-bye. >> Peek-a-boo. >> Hello. >> Hi, Jerell. >> My muse is actually this woman here. >> Okay. How are you gonna take that and show me this as a designer? >> Definitely in the shape. Like, I made this neckpiece here that's gonna be very interesting. It's bold, it's confident. >> What--did you get these from Mood? >> No, no, no. Actually, I got that from the Neiman Marcus accessory wall. >> There's some really good stuff in there. >> Beautiful pieces. >> All right, so I am feeling a little anxious about this mix. >> When you see it all together, it's just the right amount of this, a little bit of that. >> You say. >> Yes, yes. >> Right. >> Jerell, hmm. Not exactly sure what's going on with that. Somebody look like they're coming to America. >> First of all, tell me who on earth gave up their clothes to you? >> She was this really cool girl. I wanted to just take her look and just sort of give it a chic glamour to it. Um, what do you think of the epaulets? Are they, like, too much? >> They're a little too exaggerated at the moment, but I think when they go down-- >> Right. >> It's a pretty nice detail, I think, especially for the belt. >> Austin's look is a little bit overworked. To me, it can come across a little cheap. >> Hello. >> How is it going? >> Speaking with Joanna and seeing Joanna is always wonderful. However, I have no clue what I'm doing. This is Mave. >> Right. You got this dress from Mave. >> I got this dress from Mave. >> What are the other things you got? >> I've got T-shirts from the people who work there. I've got shirts from boys. I don't know if I was more interested in the shirt or the boy, but-- >> Well, that's not gonna help you with your design. >> Inspiration can come from anywhere. >> Well, that's true. >> [Laughs] Uh... >> Talk to me about the look that you're pulling together. >> This is gonna be, like, a jacket, just a little, cropped jacket. I'm not exactly sure about the top. I'm trying to finish the jacket, because I feel like because of the busyness of the print, it's gonna guide me in exactly where I want to go with everything else. >> Okay. I'm surprised that you're doing this, because I still think of you as sort of Anthony the gown maker, but this sounds like it's gonna come together. >> I know Anthony's having a really hard time with the items that he got from Union Square. He got a very trippy polyester print, and, I mean, that doesn't sound like Anthony at all. >> Hi, Michael. >> Hi, Joanna. >> How's it going? >> Um, okay. I'm in a better place today. >> Why? What happened to you yesterday? >> Well, during the last few hours of last night, I came up with this concept, and was able to try and get this sort of thing done. >> These slightly remind me of sort of doilies. >> No! "Doily" was not the word I was wanting to hear. >> All right, well, throw yourself at it. No--no playing safe, okay? >> Michael's design looks very amateur. He had this lace that is not a good look. >> All right, guys, I'm off. Remember, keep it edgy and have a great runway show. >> Thank you. >> Okay, bye. >> Bye. [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ >> Do you see this? After Joanna critiqued it and said, "it reads off as a bit doily," I made this top. I really had to piece it together. I've never done something like that before, and now it's architecturally really cool. I will piece it together until it can't be pieced no more. [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ >> Mondo has a gift of combining different fabrics, prints, textiles. I think he's really amazing at that, um, and that doesn't work for everybody. >> Yeah. Okay, like, check it out in the mirror. >> Jerell's design is one of the most tasteless things I've ever seen in my life. >> They're gonna so love that. After my model fitting that just went like butter on toast, I expect to be in the top three. I'm--I'm rea--I'm ready to win, actually. [Bleep] what you heard. I'm ready to win. >> And with the shorts I think it'll be really interesting. >> All right, how does that feel? >> Good. >> Feels good? >> Mm-hmm. >> I think, going into this challenge, I have questioned myself so much to where that, at this point, and it's in the final hours, I don't even have a garment. So do y'all talk about who y'all think is going home next? >> I hope it's not us. >> No, I hope it's not us. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> Kenley finished Kara's pants. >> That's not okay. >> This is my edgy bitch look. >> Kenley is loud. If a black person says that you are loud, you are too loud. >> [Laughs] >> Why aren't you looking as modern and chic as you were in my head? I am most definitely struggling in this challenge, and I keep, in my mind, trying to make it work, and it keeps telling me, "bitch, stop." In my heart, I want to do a straight-legged pant that is gorgeous, and I'm trying to take T-shirts, old, dated 1970 dresses, and turn them into something that is beautiful and fashion-forward. It looks grandmama. [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ >> I was gonna use the charmeuse fuchsia, and then I'm like, "this T-shirt fuchsia's kind of cool." >> Oh. >> Mila, Kenley, and myself are the last three girls left, and it's kind of, now that you see the pattern, you realize that all the ladies are going, but the girls are doing good on this challenge. Mila's got great pants, Kenley's got a great dress, I'm gonna have a great outfit. Girls are solid. >> That's really pretty. >> My denim jacket is made from two pairs of pants, and it's roughly 22 pieces. It's a lot of seam-work, but it's coming out really nice. >> It's so cute. >> What am I gonna use? >> Ooh, Anthony, fuchsia. >> I basically create this kind of onesie, uh, palazzo pants jumper. >> Oh, I love the waistband. >> I have my energy back, I'm very pleased with my design, and I'm very excited to see it on the runway. >> All right, everybody, it's 9:00. Let's go home. >> Okay, I'm coming. [Laughs] [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ >> We're back at the workroom in the morning to get ready for the runway, and I feel like I'm on the right track and everything is falling into place. >> This is my edgy bitch look. >> Kenley is loud. >> [Laughs] >> If a black person says that you are loud, you are too loud. >> [Laughs] >> Okay, now the other way. >> Hey, girl. ♪ ♪ >> Look at that. >> Whoa, damn, girl. You're gonna get some looks walking down that street. Ah, girl! >> I see Michael's look, and I really appreciate it, 'cause I think it's daring, and that girl's just hot. Jerell's, it's having a lot of conversations. There's a lot of women in this one outfit, so I'm trying to figure out who this woman is. You know, your bum looks amazing. [Overlapping chatter] >> Put your legs together. >> So kenley finished Kara's pants, including the fit, sewing, and some other stuff. >> Are you serious? >> Yeah. >> What the [bleep]? I would never ask somebody to finish sewing anything for me. I just think that's not okay. I feel like it's all on you. I mean, this is a competition, after all. It's so insane how she's, like, in everybody's business this morning, like, walking around like a teacher. >> They're very appropriate for what you're doing. Oh, my gosh, these are perfect. Oh, what a cute hat. No, no, no, no, cut it more. >> Why are you trying to give advice? Don't you want to win? Unbelievable. >> I don't want to take it too high 'cause-- >> No, no, no, not high. >> Did you want me to finish this for you? >> No. >> [Laughs] >> [Giggles] [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ >> It's time to take our models to the L'Oreal hair and makeup room. So we're doing punk rock glam today. >> Uh-huh. >> Very Sarah Jessica Parker circa 1999 meets 2002. >> Mm-hmm. >> But futuristic. ♪ ♪ >> I would love to have, like, a voluminous ponytail. >> Okay. ♪ ♪ >> Thanks, you guys. ♪ ♪ >> Hey, you guys, we've got ten minutes before we hit the runway, okay? Pull these sloppy-ass looks together. ♪ ♪ >> I can't believe I'm not even sweating. ♪ ♪ >> Hey, everybody, it's time to head down to the runway. Come on, let's go. >> Coming up on Project Runway All Stars... >> It looks the opposite of sexy. >> Visually, there's just--it's too confusing. >> I feel like she's walking around without her skirt on. >> Hello, designers. >> All: Hi. >> This week's challenge took you out onto the streets of New York to find a muse. We asked you to persuade people to give you the clothes off their back to create a fashion-forward version of that look. So, let's meet the judges. First, we have designer and cofounder of Marchesa, Georgina Chapman. >> Hi. >> Hey. >> And next we have one of the most famous names in fashion, Isaac Mizrahi. >> Hi. >> Hello. >> And our guest judge this week is a rising star on the New York fashion scene. He took time out from crushing the opposition on the ice to interning at Vogue magazine. By day, he's a bad boy of hockey, and by night, he's a GQ trendsetter--New York Rangers' hockey star Sean Avery. [Applause] >> Hello, guys. >> Sean Avery's a hottie hockey player and he interned at Vogue, and I love his persona. I think he's great. >> So let's do it. Have a great show. [Upbeat music] >> I think it's fun when you get to work with real people in mind, and thinking about what the look is for. I think that it's kind of refreshing. >> She's very elegant. ♪ ♪ >> My model looks like the coolest, sexiest, baddest bitch on the block. >> That's awesome. >> It's chic, it's edgy, it's fun. It definitely has this rock star coolness to it, but with sort of couture feeling as well. ♪ ♪ >> I'm hoping the judges notice the clean lines, just understated chic, and just, like, a certain, um, effortlessness about her, that it doesn't feel tortured. ♪ ♪ >> The look comes together perfectly for me. It looks exactly like what I was going for--a hip, beautiful girl walking down the street in a cool outfit that she put together. ♪ ♪ >> I think my model looks amazing. She's exactly what I was going for. It's sexy, it's young, it's Jerell. I love my look. I think it totally reads true to who I am. I think it's definitely appropriate for the challenge, and I think it stands out on the runway. Work for me, mama. ♪ ♪ >> I think she looks beautiful. I love the design. It looks feminine. It looks elegant. It looks chic. It's a beautiful design. >> Oh, oh, Jabeau. ♪ ♪ >> I really love the way she looks. She looks fresh, she looks young. She looks like she could go anywhere on a hot summer day and feel great doing it. ♪ ♪ >> Wow, she looks wonderful. She looks like a dream realized. She's done in great taste. I think that the design is very well balanced and there's nothing else that I could do to make this look be any more beautiful than what it already is. ♪ ♪ >> My model looks really good. I think she's bringing a really great energy to the runway, and, once again, she doesn't disappoint me. She looks like a million bucks. Her confidence exudes and holds up the entire outfit. ♪ ♪ >> If I call your name, please step forward. Kenley, Mila, Kara. Congratulations, ladies. You're safe. Your designs will keep you in the competition. You can relax and leave the runway. Gentlemen, let's bring out your models. We'll start with you, Rami. >> I was inspired by the menswear take, and I wanted to take that and sort of use it in a womenswear type of look. >> I like the way you put the trim on the shorts. They look very well made. I can see who your woman is. I can see the pairing, and I think it's well-done. >> I really like the look. Congratulations, 'cause that's not easy to do shorts, and her legs look great. >> Thank you. >> I would love to see women in business suits with this kind of style, as opposed to just the boring, conservative look. Great. Thank you, Rami. Michael, you're next. >> My muse was this bohemian girl. She was really cute. And I used the shorts that I took from one lady and constructed this top, and used the top that I got from one lady and made shorts. >> I have to say, if my daughter ever walked out in New York in shorts that short, she would be put straight back through the front door. I don't see many women walking around New York like that. Maybe on the beach. >> I thought it was a swimsuit when I saw it come out. >> The sagginess of the top, that really is bothersome. When you're talking about, like, burning your bra, that's fine, but don't look like that, do you know what I mean? >> Yeah, it needs a little more structure. >> I think that if it was paired with something, maybe a jacket or something that she just wasn't so bare. >> Jerell. >> I saw this, um, mother and son walking. They seemed really happy. And I love my, like, kind of ethnic prints, and I love to mix things. That was kind of my inspiration. >> She looks like someone that should be in, like, The Lion King or something. >> It looks like a costume from--from, like, stage. >> Initially, what I wrote down was, "Lady Gaga and Gwen Stefani at Burning Man on acid." [Laughter] >> I could see that. >> Yeah. >> I absolutely love what you've done on the top, and I'm torn because of that. See, you've got so many good elements there, I think it, visually, that it's just--it's too confusing. >> Something about that big stomach right now, it just--it doesn't look sexy. It looks the opposite of sexy. >> You should never refer to a woman's stomach as big. >> Sorry. >> [Laughs] >> Mondo. >> Hi. My muse was this young woman named Grace, and the black jeans are from a guy named Pedro. And then, this piece of patent was the piece I bought from Mood. >> I would die for this outfit. I love it. >> Thank you. >> I think that, um, Grace would be so proud. And I love her hair. I love her whole look. >> Can we see the back as well? You see a neat little detailing in the back, and the way the little "v" comes down with the stripes in the shorts, and so flattering. >> I love how bare it is and how covered it is and how in control that girl is. Everything about her, I really, really like. >> I could picture a lot of girls walking around the streets, whether you were Uptown or Downtown or in Midtown, wearing that. >> Thank you, Mondo. >> Thank you. >> Anthony. >> I had a lot of T-shirts, for some reason, bright colored T-shirts, and I had that as the foundation, which is actually the print in the bag. >> So how much of this look was actually used from fabric of the streets? >> Um, everything above the waist, as well as the bag. >> She looks beautiful. >> I like it. I would do a double-back on a woman that walked by me wearing that. Would you? >> Don't ask him that. [Laughter] >> I love the look, but part of the judging criteria has to be 50% of the fabric, and part of being a designer is to design within the parameters that you're given. >> It's lovely, but I don't think it really answers the challenge. >> Thank you, Anthony. >> Thank you. >> Okay, Austin, how did you get along on the streets of New York? >> I found this amazing girl to be my muse. Her name was Jamie, and she just had this really awesome sort of punk rock, a little glam, sort of girly look that I really responded to. >> I love the proportion. I think it's really nice. You really nipped her waist in. It's very sweet, yet it has a toughness to it too. >> It might be a little bit too much on the left shoulder. >> The minute I see those kind of details on her lapel and the rip in her stocking, I go, "ooh, no," because it's--she's out of control, do you know what I mean? >> Yes. >> And yet, it's fabulous. Congratulations. I mean, it's divine. >> I think that your muse would be really happy to wear this. >> Thank you. >> Thank you, boys. You may leave the runway. Let's discuss the high scorers. Rami. >> I have to say, I like that somebody focused on tailoring, but adding that hat to it... >> As soon as she came out with the hat, that was it for me. It just felt too forced. >> I do like the--the ruffled shirt. I like that as a business shirt. >> I think it was very smart, the way he used the trouser, and I thought the construction of the shirt was good. I wasn't sure about the print of the shirt. >> Drama. It lacks drama. >> But it's very well made. >> Shall we move on to Austin? >> What I love is the way the jacket comes right to the waist and then the skirt goes out. >> The construction of the neckline bothered me slightly, but I think the overall effect was great. >> And he loves a woman. He loves making a girl look girly in that way. Mondo thinks about the big look and the micro details, and he has a great eye. >> It was so fresh and modern, and I think it was very much what people are doing right now, yet a new interpretation. >> If I have one criticism for Mondo, it's that it's a little too stylish, do you know? Like, it gives the woman absolutely nowhere to go with it to make it her own. >> And then it's hard to wear the outfit any other way. >> And then it's hard to wear the outfit-- >> It's like just wearing it straight off the runway. So let's talk about our three lowest scores. >> Jerell's look here is exciting. I see a thought process that I like. >> It is sort of over the top, but there's an artistry to the way the pieces are mixed together, the prints, but still, all of that stomach is not something a girl would ever want to show on the street. I don't care how far downtown she is, you know? >> Jerell, he just put his head down and went for it. >> He got this part right, but totally missed the concept of taking it into a dress, and I want to see him grow as a designer. >> When Michael's look came out, I thought, really? >> It was collapsing. >> Why wouldn't he put a backing behind those shorts? >> He's such a good craftsman too. I couldn't understand why that happened. >> I felt bad for his model too, 'cause you could just see she didn't feel comfortable. I just didn't feel confidence from either of them once they both came out and stood in front of us. >> Anthony comes across to me, especially in today's challenge, as a bit lazy. >> The fit was very nice on the top, and it was clean and it was understandable in that sense. It's just a question of whether we can judge him on the fact that he didn't use fabric from the street. >> Well, I guess he made a purse and a turban and a belt, so is that 50%? >> That's my issue. >> That's where I am. >> And it's got nothing to do with his muse. >> Look, I like that after all these weeks from doing nothing but dresses, suddenly he did pants. That's a good thing. And I love jumpsuits. Nobody loves a jumpsuit more than me. >> Oh, I love a jumpsuit. I find them so chic. >> [Gasps] No, I love them. >> [Laughs] >> So are we all agreed? >> Agreed. >> All right, well, let's bring the guys out. Designers, one of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be going home. >> Designers, it's clear you had a great time with this challenge, but one of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be going home. Rami, you are safe. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Mondo, Austin, one of you will win this week's challenge. And that designer is... Mondo. >> Oh, thank you so much. >> Congratulations. >> Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. >> Well, done, Mondo. You're through to next week and one step closer to that grand prize. You can leave the runway. >> Bye. I have been waiting for this, and it feels so, so good. >> Austin, we loved your design. It was a really cool look. You can also leave the runway. >> Thank you. >> Jerell... You're safe. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you very much. >> Michael, Anthony, one of you will be in, and one of you will be out. Michael, it's clear that you had a tough time with this challenge. You had serious construction issues, and if you're gonna show us something that bold, it has to be perfect. Anthony, we saw very little inspiration from your muse in your design. It was a nice outfit, but you played it too safe, and you didn't embrace the spirit of the challenge. Anthony... I'm sorry to say you're out. Michael, you're safe. >> [Exhales] I am so sorry. >> No, don't be sorry. >> I'm sorry. >> Honey, I'm smiling, so you shouldn't--don't, no. And I have cute shoes. >> You have cute shoes, okay. >> You can leave the runway, Michael. >> Okay, thank you. >> Anthony, thank you for being part of All Stars. >> Thank you. >> You are an all star. >> I am. >> Mwah. >> Thank you. It has been my pleasure. I wanted to push myself in this process to be the absolute best that I could be for Anthony, and I have superseded my expectations. Hi. I will miss the designers. Hi. I've met some beautiful people. I want you to dry those tears and fight harder. It has truly been an amazing experience. I'm gonna miss the competition, but I don't think that I had to stay here till the end to do what I needed to do. I have no regrets. I have absolutely no disappointments this time around. I'm good. >> Next on Project Runway All Stars... Let's make this a fashion faceoff. >> Oh. >> Okay. >> This is like Wrestlemania. Well, fashionmania. >> I'm glad you're doing that, 'cause I know I'll win. >> Where'd you get the inspiration for that shape, Michael? Michael is cutting the same jacket as me. >> Like, it's [bleep]. I got to be accused of plagiarism? >> There's a cozy spot for him in the bottom. >> I'm gonna wipe my [bleep] with the vest. If the gloves need to come off, then it's about time for them to come off. >> I wish I had never seen that. >> She looks like a bore. >> This look didn't push any creative boundaries. >> These two looks are so similar. >> Visit mylifetime.com to learn more about the fashion seen on tonight's show. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
