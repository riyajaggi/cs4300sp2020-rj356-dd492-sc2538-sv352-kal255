 [boat horn sounds in distance]
 [tires screeching]
 [man] Hey, tell Marie I'm on my way. I'm headed to the hospital now.
 And tell her I love her.
 And everything's gonna be okay.
 Hey, call me when you get this and let me know what's going on.
 [cellphone buzzing]
 -Marie? -Nah, it's DiAngelo.
 -You talk to her yet? -I can't get through to her.
 Her cousin Teresa isn't picking up either.
 She's gonna pull through, man. The baby, too.
 Yeah. They will.
 Hey, look, I gotta go, I gotta try her again.
 I'll catch up with you later.
 Yeah, I'll catch you later, man. Call me back when you hear some--
 [loud smash]
 [tires screeching]
 [breathing heavily]
 [bicycle spokes clicking]
 [police radio chatter]
 You okay, Pete?
 What happened?
 He came out of nowhere.
 [officer] DiAngelo.
 What condition's he in? Male, female, what?
 I don't know.
 What the fuck you do, Jablonski?
 [officer] Who's over there, Di?
 Stay on the fucking road.
 Put it in the trunk.
 Di.
 You talk to your wife yet?
 How's she doing?
 What the fuck are you talking about?
 No one saw you, right?
 Yo, Di!
 This is what's gonna happen.
 You're gonna leave right now. Go.
 -[officer] Di, what the fuck? -Shut up!
 -No, we got to call it in. -He's dead.
 There's nothing you can do for him.
 Did you go over there?
 Did you see what's in that ditch?
 They're gonna crucify you for this.
 Every one of us is gonna pay for this. You understand what I'm saying, right?
 No one's gonna find him here, okay?
 No one's gotta know.
 Hey. Hey.
 I said I got this.
 Get to the hospital. Go be with your wife.
 Drive away.
 [starts engine]
 [DiAngelo] Get it out of the road.
 Where do you want me to put it?
 [indistinct call over PA]
 -[Marie] Yeah. -What are you doing to her?
 Oh, Pete.
 It's okay. Don't look so worried. It's just a little spotting.
 Did you see Teresa? She was-- She just walked out.
 Dr. Taranaweh ran an ultrasound. I can pull it up for you if you want.
 No, why don't you get the fucking doctor?
 Yeah. Sure.
 Seriously, Petey?
 That was rude.
 No, you said you were bleeding.
 It stopped.
 Okay?
 -You-- -It's fine. I promise.
 Hey, come here. Come here.
 We're past the five month mark, Pete.
 I have a good feeling, you know?
 Yeah, I know. No, it's just...
 -You just scared me there. -I know. I know.
 What happened?
 It was nothing. No, we just...
 -We were working. -[nurse] Doc will be here in a minute.
 [nurse] It'll turn itself off.
 [baby's heart beating on ultrasound]
 Babe.
 There he is.
 Little Poke.
 [kids shouting]
 [indistinct chatter]
 -[woman] Don't lose anymore, all right? -[school bell rings]
 Those things are expensive. Last pair. All right.
 Excuse me.
 -You waiting for somebody? -Yeah, my brother.
 He's supposed to be here.
 What grade is he in?
 Sixth.
 No, sixth graders, they left already, so that means he left too.
 -Is there somebody you want to call? -Yeah, I just did. My mom.
 Maybe your brother walked home?
 He didn't.
 He takes his bike to school.
 [alarm wailing]
 [woman] What your brother would be doing down here is beyond me.
 He's not here. He's at the park.
 [indistinct voices from the street]
 [indistinct dialogue]
 [police siren starts]
 [man shouts indistinctly]
 [rap music playing on street]
 [hip hop music playing]
 [woman] Do you see him?
 [teen boy laughs] All right!
 Where else do you think he could be?
 I don't know.
 Ryan!
 What the fuck?
 Little shit.
 -[door shuts] -Fuck off.
 [starts engine]
 [Ryan] I, uh...
 kind of sat on this. Sorry.
 It's okay.
 What is that?
 [woman] It's a seagull.
 My son Brenton made it.
 [girl] Wow. It's cool.
 Put on your seat belts. If we hurry up, we can get you home
 before it really starts kicking up.
 [upbeat soul music playing]
 [bartender] Ready for another?
 Yeah.
 [cell phone buzzes]
 -I got tied up on the turnpike. So sorry. -[clerk] All rise.
 Superior court of Hudson County, state of New Jersey, is now in session,
 Honorable Richard Blatt presiding.
 Please sit.
 Um...
 Your Honor, the State presents complaint number...
 Uh, it's... Got it. Uh, it's...
 complaint number 5977.
 This is the defendant's third shoplifting charge.
 Ms. Lufts stole $200 in cat food.
 You've got the wrong defendant.
 That's not the complaint number I'm looking at, Counselor.
 Um...
 Get your paperwork in order before you walk into my courtroom.
 -Your Honor, I have it right here. It-- -[judge] Next.
 [strikes gavel]
 [crowd clapping]
 [man] Our county is the gold standard in law enforcement.
 Working hand in hand with its citizens.
 The police violence we're witnessing
 in black and brown communities throughout America
 has no place in New Jersey.
 As prosecutor, good police and community relations
 have been a priority in my administration.
 [reporter] Mr. Connelly, when are you announcing your run for governor?
 [car alarm chirps]
 [inhales deeply]
 [sighs]
 [grunting, screams]
 [sniffles, sobs]
 [man] Darius!
 [dog barking]

 [woman] He was a little off-beat though.
 -Gotta tell you. -[man] No.
 I saw Brother Jerrel and you saw Brother Jerrel too.
 And who he was looking at.
 -[man chuckling] -Oh, you are crazy!
 'Saiah, you know that woman is married.
 I know, I'm just saying she looked good after she lost all that weight.
 Brenton? Baby, you home?
 Brenton! Your mama's calling you, boy!
 He should be here by now. Or did he forget about tonight too?
 No, Uncle Seth's coming home, and that's all he could talk about.
 He is so excited. He's got a surprise for the both of you.
 What? That he forgot his uncle's homecoming?
 Aw, come on, he's either in the yard or upstairs in his room. I'll check.
 I see he's been messing with my TV again.
 I can't turn it on if he's done playing with his damn video games.
 Well, maybe you should leave it off seeing as you got a whole house to paint.
 [automated voice] You have one new message.
 Brenton!
 [man] Yeah, we're looking for the parents of Brenton Butler.
 Could you call the South District police station when you get the message?
 It concerns your son.
 [machine beeps]
 [siren wailing]
 I heard the callout.
 [officer] Found him with a BMX bike that's pretty banged up.
 [detective] Got any ID on the kid?
 Brenton Butler. Black male, 15 years old.
 Notified the parents. He's at the ER at Jersey City Medical Center in surgery.
 [detective] Anyone have a conversation with the parents?
 [officer] Wanted to wait for you.
 -He's alive? -[officer 2] Yeah.
 He's probably fucking brain dead. It's like the Red Sea down there.
 [officers chattering indistinctly]
 [siren wailing]
 [indistinct chatter]
 -Hey. I'm sorry, brother. Um... -You gotta wait.
 I'm sorry. It's my son. He's been in a car accident.
 You got to wait in line.
 We're sorry, we don't know what's going on with our son. Please?
 -Thank you, thank you, thank you. -His name is Brenton. Brenton Butler.
 [receptionist] There's no "r." It's "Benton."
 Gave me the wrong spelling. I'll need you to fill this out.
 -Do you have your insurance card, ID? -[woman] Yeah.
 Have a seat, the doctor will talk to you when he's done in surgery.
 Surgery?
 Just have a seat. The doctor will talk to you when he's done.
 -Why would he be in surgery? -I don't know.
 They don't tell us these things.
 Please, just have a seat.
 Surgery?
 [Isaiah mutters] Why is he in surgery?
 Why do they have him in surgery? Why's he in surgery?
 Father God, praise be to you.
 Your glory, your mercy.
 Watch over our baby.
 Please don't let my baby die, Father God. I don't know...
 I ask this in your holy name.
 Please, Father God. Look after my...

 [horn blaring]
 [truck horn honking]
 [gasps]
 [tires screeching]
 Fuck. [breath trembling]
 You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.
 -You're fine. -[windshield wipers scraping]
 [switches blades off]
 [beating steering wheel]
 [cellphone buzzing]
 I'd been sleeping in my car under the Pulaski the whole day.
 Nobody bothers me there,
 except when that cop came banging on my window.
 Did you drive through the park this morning?
 No, I-- I told you I was sleeping under the Pulaski all day.
 [man] Drinking too, right?
 -All the live long day. - [knocking, door opens]
 You the on-call AP?
 Yeah, I'm KJ Harper. They just put me back on an hour ago.
 Right. One of my CIs tipped us off to this guy.
 Saw Gramps here cleaning blood off the front of his car
 near the park this morning.
 We just picked him up riding around near there,
 two sheets to the wind.
 Why's narcotics interested in a hit-and-run?
 We just got a tip.
 -Hmm. -And he looks good for it.
 Two prior DUIs, it's a matter of time before he killed someone.
 That's in the report. You read that, right?
 Of course I did.
 I just didn't realize reports were read by every Joe in the district.
 [chuckles] Every...
 Mike DiAngelo.
 KJ.
 I've seen you before, down at the courthouse.
 You work the shoplifting cases.
 [officer chuckles]
 You got this tied up with a bow.
 You got enough for a plea without lifting one bejeweled nail.
 -[cell phone buzzing] -I know how to do my job, but thanks.
 Well, then do it.
 Mr. Dorsey seems to believe he was asleep in his car.
 Well, what's he gonna say?
 "Oh, I just rolled over some kid's head in my Buick, my bad"?
 [DiAngelo laughing] Come on.
 Okay. Thanks.
 Hey.
 The trash can's down there.
 [cell phone buzzing]
 This fucking guy. It's your boy, Jablonski.
 He keeps calling.
 [Dorsey] I didn't kill no kid. I was sleeping.
 [sirens wailing in the distance]
 [detective] Yo! Ms. Harper!
 Yo! Hey!
 Are you the assistant prosecutor on my job?
 I'm Joe Rinaldi. You can call me Fish.
 Uh, former NYPD,
 but I just got this new place out on the water. It's fucking beautiful.
 The kids love it, so I figured, fuck it, why not Jersey.
 -Did you need something from me? -Uh, yeah.
 Yeah. The guys in there said that you're ready to file this job.
 -You got enough for that? -Yep.
 Yep. Okey-dokey. Um...
 Yo, are you going to the hospital? I need to pick up the victim's belongings.
 -Yeah. Yeah, I am. -Mind if I ride with?
 Sure. Yeah.
 If we pass a bodega en route, think about picking up some mints.
 I'm just-- I don't care.
 I'm just saying, out of respect for the family.
 I can smell you like a mile away. Not a good look.
 Actually, I have to go to the office for some paperwork, so...
 Get your own ride there.
 -[chuckles] -[car door slams]
 [indistinct chatter]
 What'd they do to my boy?
 What'd they do to my boy?
 -[man] Be with you every step of the way. -[Seth] It's all good, bro.
 It's all right.
 Oh, Latrice.
 [Seth] It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right.
 Brenton, he was counting the days to see you in uniform.
 It's been a while. He's so proud.
 And he wants to hear all the stories about Afghanistan and Kandastan.
 Are you the parents of Brenton Butler?
 -Uh, yeah. -He's stable.
 I was able to relieve the pressure on his brain,
 but there's been significant impact,
 primarily to the posterior cortex, the back of his head.
 What does that mean?
 He could lose the ability to function independently.
 He could be on a ventilator for a long time.
 What happened? Was he at school?
 -The police haven't told us. -[doctor] I don't know. I'm sorry.
 Uh, can we see him now?
 Not everyone right now, just the parents.
 -You can come with me. -Okay.
 [monitor beeping steadily]
 [artificial ventilator pumping]
 [Latrice gasps]
 [sharp inhale]
 [whimpering sobs]
 [indistinct police radio chatter]
 -Where's DiAngelo at? -Come here.
 Not picking up his phone. No one's picking up.
 [Pete] Now what the fuck is going on?
 DiAngelo would fucking lose his mind if he saw you here.
 We're taking care of it.
 The kid's alive. Now that's what you call taking care of it? Huh?
 You think we fucking knew that?
 Look, all I'm saying is there's got to be another way.
 This is wrong, and you know it is.
 This whole thing's gonna blow up.
 And we're all gonna go to prison for a fucking accident.
 A white cop and a black kid?
 Don't you watch the news?
 There are no fucking accidents anymore, and you know it.
 The assistant prosecutor's filing papers on a guy tonight. It's over.
 What guy?
 Who cares, man? Not you.
 Excuse me, I just started the Narcotics Unit here.
 DiAngelo's team?
 You know who's um... who's working the hit-and-run in the park?
 Another new guy, Rinaldi. He's out, left an hour ago.
 -[Pete] Know when he's gonna be back? -I have no idea.
 Do you want to leave a message?
 What about the captain? You got his name?
 You got a report, you can turn it in to your supervising officer.
 I gotta talk to the captain. Direct.
 I'll leave my cell, all right?
 Just make sure he gets it.
 Yep.
 [door bangs shut]
 [elevator bell dings]
 Got the kid's clothing. How about you?
 Get all your personal business taken care of?
 Pick up some milk? Go to the bank?
 That's good. That's important.
 [Fish] Mr. Butler? Mrs. Butler?
 Who are you?
 We're with the prosecutor's office. We're looking for the parents.
 Yes.
 I'm Detective Rinaldi. This is KJ Harper.
 [Isaiah] What happened to my son?
 -They said he was in a car accident. -[Latrice] Yeah.
 No one's talked to us. The police haven't said anything.
 [Fish] Uh, we need some privacy right now to talk. Please.
 Joseph, can you give us a minute?
 There's a waiting room at the end of the hall.
 There'll be a bail hearing tomorrow before the arraignment at the courthouse.
 [Seth] That's not what they asked.
 We need to know exactly how this happened.
 Your son was in a hit-and-run this morning at Liberty State Park.
 [Isaiah] This morning?
 They didn't call us until a few hours ago.
 That's when they found him, earlier tonight.
 Two people found him. Their dog, actually.
 [KJ] We have the man in custody who we believe did this.
 I'll be filing paperwork with the judge tonight
 for his hearing first thing tomorrow.
 Can you be a little more clear with the details? I...
 [KJ] Oh... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 [Fish] It's a nice bike your son's got.
 Five Kings rides them too.
 That series of BMX goes for some serious bank.
 What are you implying?
 That Brenton's with a gang? Really? You gonna do this now?
 Wanna step back, whoever you are, and let me talk to the family?
 I am family, and I don't appreciate you coming up in here
 -and accusing my nephew-- -[Isaiah] Seth, let me handle this.
 We bought the bike.
 Brenton's 16th birthday's coming up soon.
 Now, what's gonna happen to the man who did this?
 Well, I'll be charging Mr. Dorsey
 with leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident
 resulting in serious bodily injury.
 And I'll suggest the maximum sentence for this type of felony.
 Which is what, exactly?
 Three to five years.
 My son laid in the cold...
 in the snow, in pain...
 for hours.
 And no one came for him except a dog.
 He may never walk again.
 He may never wake up again.
 And you're telling me that the person that did this
 will get three to five years?
 That man deserves to die for what he did to my son!
 Latrice.
 I'm sorry.
 [Fish] My card.
 [Fish sighs]
 [car alarm chirps]
 -[KJ sighs] Damn it. -[alarm chirps]
 You're locking yourself out doing it like that. Just click it once.
 I don't need to be told how to unlock my damn car.
 Okay.
 What? Come on. Harper!
 -[Fish] Come on! -[knocking]
 -[starts engine] -But we gotta go to impound.
 We gotta get the paperwork on Dorsey's car.
 -[Fish] Harper, please. -[knocking]
 Harper, look. Look.
 This is you when the night's done and you don't have to see me anymore.
 [Fish] Thank you.
 [pastor] Today we claim promises over our son Brenton.
 We believe in the healing power of faith and prayer
 and ask you to begin your mighty work in the life of Brenton.
 Lord, your word speaks promises of healing and restoration.
 And we thank you for the miracles you still perform today.
 [monitor beeping steadily]
 Is he gonna live?
 What?
 [Pete] I'm sorry. I was in the wrong room.
 I'm gonna turn myself in.
 But nobody's gotta know none of you were there.
 Just to be clear...
 this is what's gonna happen.
 Well, they are gonna fuck you...
 for Ferguson...
 Chicago, Baltimore...
 for every white cop who ever killed a black kid.
 -It was an accident. -No one gives a shit.
 So, before you do anything,
 I want you to think about what kind of father you'd be behind bars...
 out of your son's life.
 He ain't ever gonna know you.
 You're a good cop, I see it. That's why I picked you.
 You and me? We're a dying breed.
 And we take care of our own, you understand?
 [DiAngelo] Don't go behind my back again.
 -[sighs] -[man speaks indistinctly]
 [Fish] I need the paperwork on my hit-and-run.
 It's Mac Dorsey's car.
 Who's the owner of the car? We need a signature.
 [Fish] I told you, Mac Dorsey.
 [Fish] Hey!
 They need your John Hancock!
 You want to wait inside?
 It'll take about half an hour to release the paperwork on the vehicle.
 [KJ] I'll wait in the car.
 Why? It's just a sign off.
 [man] My supervisor's on break.
 It's two in the fucking morning, what's he doing?
 [man] It's out of my hands. You can wait inside--
 -[cell phone buzzes] -Rather freeze my balls off. Thanks.
 [Fish] Hey.
 Well, you gotta use the tape on the diaper, I told you that.
 Or he's gonna be dropping shit bombs all over the place.
 Well, use your head.
 How's Lizzie doing? Give her the hamburger yet?
 [Fish] That's good.
 And the twins?
 What do you mean what about them? They've been depressed all week.
 [Fish continues indistinctly]
 All right, well, about another half hour.
 I'll call you from the road.
 [Fish] You gonna hit that?
 Because there's a cream.
 [KJ] What?
 I'm telling you, hobo herpes, it's a thing. I swear to God.
 Did you see Dorsey's face?
 That pastor of yours found a chapel downstairs.
 Wants you to head down for some holy rolling with Jesus.
 Seth. Enough.
 [monitor beeping steadily]
 Why'd you tell the police we bought Brenton that bike?
 You saw his face.
 He already had his mind made up that he was in a gang.
 Because of what? The bike?
 Where'd he get it from?
 What was he doing in that park?
 I won't tolerate you covering up for him anymore.
 I know he'd been going back to the projects, and that park,
 after I explicitly told him not to go.
 'Saiah, he misses his friends.
 He misses his home.
 That's not his home.
 Not anymore.
 I don't know where he got it.
 [Seth] You ought to go with him.
 Go on, Tricey. I'll stay here with B.
 He's gonna suffocate Brenton with all of his worries.
 Just like he did you.
 Kid must've been conscious for a while.
 He's stuck between these two snowbanks here.
 Crawling around,
 trying to find a way out, probably screaming for his mama.
 Crime scene photos give you the heebie-jeebies?
 I don't need to look at them.
 Isn't that, like, your job? [clears throat]
 Nope. My job is to file paperwork.
 File paperwork? You could file paperwork at any fuck-face firm down on the water.
 I'm sick of their eyes.
 What?
 Even when they're dead, it's...
 They're looking at you, wanting answers.
 You worked Homicide before?
 How'd you get bumped to car crimes?
 Car crimes. Heh... right.
 Paralyzing a kid gets you three to five years,
 but it's guaranteed you won't do most of that time.
 It's the greatest show on Earth, this shit.
 Did you see the driver's seat in Dorsey's car?
 Mm-hm.
 That narc cop said he had to chase him down,
 driving around outside the park, right? That's how they caught him.
 So?
 So, how do you drive lying down?
 Here comes asshat. Finally.
 -[man] Have a good night. -Whatever. Go fuck yourself.
 Ah, okay.
 I'm gonna write up the kid's belongings in the morning. [sniffs]
 -Okay. -You know, I can get an Uber from here.
 But, yo, it was good working with you.
 Yeah. You too.
 And um...
 Listen, the dead don't need answers.
 They're dead. Okay?
 See you at trial in the morning. Don't forget about those mints, huh?
 [KJ sighs]
 [taps window]
 Asshole.
 Oh...
 Fuck!
 [exhales]
 [monitor beeping steadily]
 [nurse] Excuse me.
 Are you family?
 I'm his attorney.
 [clerk] Complaint number 39012, the State versus Mac Henry Dorsey.
 The counselor's appearance for the record.
 [judge] Is the State gonna talk?
 Judge, it's not my complaint number.
 Then where the hell is my prosecutor?
 [attorney] I'm sorry, Judge. I don't know.
 Next case.
 [clerk] Complaint number 39013, the State versus Lonny Mendoza.
 [geese honking]
