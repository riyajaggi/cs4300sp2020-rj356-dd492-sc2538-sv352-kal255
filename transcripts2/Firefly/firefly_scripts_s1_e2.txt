 Firefly (2002â€“2003): Season 1, Episode 2 - Bushwhacked - full transcript 
 The Serenity hits a wrecked transport vessel that was transporting settler's families and Mal decides to check whether there are survivors or goods. He goes on board with Zoe and they find a survivor completely mad and bring him to the Serenity. They also find some valuable goods and the fate of the crew that was attacked by the Reavers. When they are ready to go, they are intercepted by an Alliance's spacecraft and their Commander Harken brings them on board for investigation. Soon Mal realizes that they are in danger and tries to convince Harken to check the survivor.

 Over here! Yeah! Too tall! Too tall! - Jayne! - Little man! Yes! Come on, little man. Shoot it. Right behind you... Yeah! Hello. Who's winning? I can't really tell. They don't seem to be playing by any civilized rules that I know.

 Well, we're pretty far from civilization. How's your sister? She's good. Better. She has her days... and she still won't talk about what it was that they did to her at the academy. Perhaps she's not sure herself. Open! Good eye! Good eye! She dreams about it. I know that much. - Nightmares. - Right behind you. And now, on the run, on this ship... I don't know if I'll be able to help her here, and I need to help her. Simon, you are. Leaving your whole world behind?

 That's incredibly selfless. - Nice. - Yeah. I selflessly turned us both into wanted fugitives. Well, we're all running from something, I suppose. Proximity alert. We must be coming up on something. Oh, my God. What can it be? We're all doomed! Who's flying this thing? Oh, right. That would be me. Back to work. - That makes us one man short. - Little Kaylee's always one man short. Hey! Say, Doc, why don't you come on down, play for our side. Inara won't mind. Wash, you have a stroke or something? - Near enough. - What happened? Anybody home? I've been hailing her, but if whoever's there is as healthy as the guy we just ran over... I can't imagine anybody's gonna be picking up. Bring us in a little closer. Get you close enough to ring the doorbell. What is it? It's a ghost. So, what do we figure? Transport ship? Converted cargo hauler. Maybe a short-range scow. You can see she don't wanna be parked like that. The port thrust's gone, and that's what's making her spin the way she is. A short-range vessel this far out into space? Retrofitted to carry passengers. Travelers pick them up cheap at government auction. A few modifications... and they serve well enough for a one-way push to the outer planets. Settlers. Cram 15, 20 families on a boat that size, you pack 'em in tight enough. - Families? - Tell you what I think. I figure that fella we run into did everyone on board. Killed 'em all. Then he decided to take a swim, see how fast his blood would boil out his ears. You're a very "up" person. - Shouldn't we report this? - To who? The Alliance? Right. They're gonna run right out here lickety-split and make sure these taxpayers are okay. Then we'll have to. If there's folks in need of help, why aren't they beamin' no distress call? - It's true. There's no beacon. - Which means it's likely no one's looking to find her. All the more reason for us to do the right thing. How's about you just say a prayer when we slide on by? Shall I remind you of the story of the Good Samaritan? I'd rather you didn't. But we'll check it out. Could be survivors, and if not, well, then... no one's gonna mind if we see if there's not something of value they might've left behind. Yeah... No, uh, someone could be hurt. Where do you think you're headed? Thought I'd offer my services... in case anyone on board required medical attention. Well, the captain and Zoe are goin' in first. We'll holler if we need ya. Somethin' wrong? Oh, no. No, I... Well, I suppose it's just the thought of a little Mylar and glass... being the only thing separating a person from... nothing. It's impressive what "nothing" can do to a man. Like that feller we bumped into. He's likely stuck up under our belly about now. That's what space trash does... kinda latches on the first big somethin' stops long enough. Hey, now. That'd be a bit like you and your sister, wouldn't it? Entering adjoining air lock now. Okay, Wash, ask Serenity to knock for us. Emergency power's up. Dashboard light. Whatever happened here happened quick. Everything was left on. Ship powered down on its own. No sign of a struggle. - They're just... - Gone. Sir. Personal log. Someone was in the middle of an entry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm here. Bad dreams again? I... I can't sleep. There's too much screaming. River, there is... there is no screaming. There was. Hey. Grab your med kit. Let's hoof it. Mal wants us both over there on the double. They found survivors? Didn't say. Right. I... I'll ask Inara to look in on River. Whatever. I ain't waitin'. I'll meet you over there. But don't take forever. Still gotta get suited up. Hi. What are you doing here? And what's with the suit? You're hilarious. Sadist. All right, enough. Ain't got time for games. As long as you're here, you may as well lend a hand. You can roll with Kaylee. Let's be quick about this. A few loads each. No need to be greedy. Where are all the people? Ship says lifeboat launched more than a week ago. We're gonna assume everyone got off okay. Anyway, we're just here to pick the bones. You two start in the engine room. Jayne, you take the galley. You, um, have this on wrong. Sir, I count 16 families signed on. Lifeboat wouldn't hold a third of that. I know. Wash, any luck? Think I found something that pretty well matches that class. The layout looks about right. Seems to me any valuables, if there are any... would likely be stored somewhere... C- Deck, aft. Good work. Keep the engine running. We shouldn't be long. River? It's Inara. Are you hungry, sweetie? River? Aren't you the least bit curious? About what? Well, what happened here. I mean, why would anybody abandon their ship in the middle of nowhere like this? For all sorts of reasons. Just not mechanical. - What? - There ain't nothin' wrong with this. Not that I can see, anyhow. Well, there's a good one. Hold the bag open. This looks to be it. Locked. Well, now, I'd say that's like to be a very good sign. Here. Gen-seed, protein, crop supplements. Everything a growing family needs... to make a fresh start on a new world. Hard subsidies for 14-plus families. - That's... - About a fortune. Forget the rest. We just take this stuff. Gonna need a hand hauling it out of here. Sir, even on a lifeboat... you'd think those who escaped would find room for some of this. Nobody escaped. Sir? Nobody. My God. I know what did this. Get her out of here. Jayne? Jayne, drop what you're doing and get to the engine room. Take Kaylee and the doctor off this boat. Don't ask questions. Jayne? Captain? Captain. Zoe! Came from above, sir. The galley. - What? - We heard shootin'. River, what are you... I followed the voices. - Don't ever leave the ship. Not ever. - Handle her, will you, son? - What in the is going on? - Not now, dear. What'd you see? Didn't. Came at me from behind. Big, though. Strong. - I think I might have hit him. - You did. No. No, no. Easy, now. No one's gonna hurt you. - No, no mercy, no. - Any more than we already did. - No mercy. - We got lots of mercy. We got lots and lots of... Oh, yes. He's a real beast. It's a wonder you're still alive. Looked bigger when I couldn't see him. I wonder how long he'd been living like that. Don't know. He must be real brave to survive like that when nobody else did. Yeah. Real hero, killin' all them people. What? No, we don't believe that. We don't, do we? Captain wouldn't have brought him on board, were that the case. Pulse is rapid. Blood pressure's high side of normal... to be expected. Weak. They were all weak. Other than the bullet wound, there doesn't appear to be any exterior trauma. Though that crack to the head you gave him probably didn't do him any good. Cattle. Cattle for the slaughter. Dope him. - I don't think that... - Just do it. No mercy. No resistance. Open up. See what's inside. No mercy. So? How's our patient? Aside from borderline malnutrition... he's in remarkably good health. So he'll live, then? Which, to my mind, is unfortunate. Not a very charitable attitude, Captain. - Charity'd be putting a bullet in his brainpan. - Mal! It'd save him the suffering. All right. No one goes in here. Nothing more we can do for him, not after what he's seen. - What do you mean? - That ship was hit by Reavers. Reavers? Mal, how can you know? He don't, that's how. No way. It was that other fella, the one we run into. Like I said before, he went stir crazy, killed the rest, then took a walk in space. - Just a second ago, you said... - Don't matter what I said. Wasn't Reavers. Reavers don't leave no survivors. Strictly speaking, I wouldn't say they did. What are you suggesting? Don't matter we took him off that boat, Shepherd. It's the place he's gonna live from now on. I don't accept that. Whatever horror he witnessed, whatever acts of barbarism... it was done by men, nothing more. - Reavers ain't men. - Of course they are. Too long removed from civilization, perhaps, but men. And I believe there's a power greater than men. A power that heals. Reavers might take issue with that philosophy... if they had a philosophy... and if they weren't too busy gnawing on your insides. Jayne's right. Reavers ain't men. Or they forgot how to be. Come to just nothin'. They got out to the edge of the galaxy, to that place of nothin'... and that's what they became. Why are we still sittin' here? If it was Reavers, shouldn't we be gone? Work ain't done. Still substantial money value sittin' over there. Oh, I ain't goin' over there with them bodies. No ruttin' way. Not if Reavers messed with 'em. Jayne, you'll scare the women. I'll go. - I've dealt with bodies. They don't worry me. - I'd like to go with him. Maybe see what I can do about putting those folks to rest. Those folks are already restin' pretty good, Shepherd. Reavers saw to that. How we treat our dead is part of what makes us different... than those did the slaughtering. All right. You go say your words. Jayne, you'll help the doctor and Shepherd Book cut down those people. - Then you'll load up the cargo. - I don't believe this. We're sittin' put for a funeral? Yes, Jayne, that is exactly what we're gonna do. Not gonna have these people lookin' over my shoulder once we're gone. I ain't sayin' there's any peace to be had... but on the off chance there is, those folks deserve a little of it. Just when I think I've got you figured out. That was real pretty, Captain, what you just said. Didn't think you were one for rituals and such. I'm not. But I figure it'll keep the others busy for a while. No reason to concern them with what's to be done. Sir? It's a real burden being right so often. - What is that? - Booby trap. Reavers sometimes leave 'em for the rescue ships. - Triggered it when we latched on. - And when we detach? It blows. Okay, so we don't detach. We just, I don't know, sit tight until... What, Reavers come back? Looks like they've jerry-rigged it with a pressure catch. It's the only thing that'd work with all these spare parts. We could probably bypass that easy, we get to the D.C. line. You tell me right now, little Kaylee. You really think you can do this? Sure. Yeah. I think so. Besides, if I mess up, it's not like you'll be able to yell at me. No. No! No mercy. What's goin' on? Well, right at this particular moment, I have to say, not a thing. - Right? - Not a gorram thing. Looked like a thing to me. Thought we might have had a situation, but it looks to be taken care of. Let's get that merchandise put away. Everyone's home, Wash. Let's go. No, no, don't you say that. It's the Reavers. - The gorram Reavers come back. - Get that stuff stored. - Like it's gonna matter! - Just do it! Reavers? Firefly-class transport... you are ordered to release control of your helm. Prepare to dock and be boarded. Looks like civilization finally caught up with us. Initiate molecular run. No mandatory registration markings on the bow. Make sure we cite them for that. Sir, we've identified the transport ship they were attached to. It was licensed to a group of families out of Bernadette. They were due to touch down in Newhall three weeks ago. Never made it. Once we secure these vultures, we'll send a team over, check it out. Sir, didn't we have a flag on a Firefly a while back? Check. Oh, here it is. An alert issued on an unidentified Firefly-class... believed to be carrying two fugitives... a brother and sister. What are they wanted for? It's not available. It's classified. Forty thousand of these old wrecks in the air, and that's all they give us. Well, I'm not about to have any surprises on a routine check. We run into these two, we shoot first. Brass can sort it out later. - So what was it? - Open the stash, pull out the goods. - I just got done putting it in. - Now I'm telling you take it out again. - Why for? - I got no notion to argue this. In about two minutes, this boat's gonna be crawling with Alliance. No. - We've gotta run. - Can't. They're pulling us in. If they find us, they'll send River back to that place to be tortured. I'd never see her again. Stack everything in plain sight. Wouldn't want it to seem like we got anything to hide. Might give them Alliance boys the wrong impression. - Or the right one. - That too. - Now, go fetch your sister. - What? Why? Are you gonna put her in plain sight too? Don't get touchy. Just do as I say. Is that why you let us stay, so you could use us as bargaining chips? - Knew there was a reason. - You are not giving her to them. Don't be a fool, son. Do as the man says. Well, quite a lot of fuss. If I didn't know better, I'd think we were dangerous. - Is this your vessel? - It is. Bought and paid for. I'm Captain Malcolm Reynolds. - And is this everyone, Captain? - By way of crew, it is. Though in our infirmary, you're gonna find a fella we rescued off that derelict. Saved him, guess you could say. Straight to the back, next to the common area. And these items, you rescued them as well? Looks to me like an illegal salvage operation. It does? That's discouraging. Alliance property too. You could lose your ship. But that is a wrist slap compared to the penalty for harbouring fugitives. A brother and sister. When I search this vessel, I won't find them, will I? No children on this boat. I didn't say children. Siblings. Adult siblings. I misunderstood. No chance they could have stowed away? No one would blame you for that, Captain. I know how these older-model Fireflies tend to have those troublesome little nooks. Do they? Smugglers and the like tend to prefer them just for that reason. We will continue this conversation in a more official capacity. I want every inch of this junker tossed. - "Junker"? - Settle down, Kaylee. But, Captain, did you hear what that purple-belly called Serenity? Shut up. Get him outta here. - You are a Companion. - Yes. And you were based for years on Sihnon. It's only in the last year that you've been shipping out with The Serenity? It's just Serenity, and that's correct. In a few weeks it will be a year. - Why is this important? - I'm just trying to put the pieces together. It's a, uh... It's a curiosity... a woman of stature such as yourself... falling in with... these types. Not in the least. It's a mutually beneficial business arrangement. I rent the shuttle from Capt. Reynolds, which allows me to expand my client base... and the captain finds that having a Companion on board... opens certain doors that might otherwise be closed to him. - And do you love him? - I don't see how that's relevant. - Well, he is your husband. - Yes. You two met through Capt. Reynolds? Captain was looking for a pilot. I found a husband. Seemed to work out. - You fought with Reynolds in the war? - Fought with a lot of people. - And your husband. - Fight with him sometimes too. Is there any particular reason you don't wish to discuss your marriage? Don't see that it's any of your business is all. We're very private people. The legs. Oh, yeah. Definitely have to say it was her legs. You can put that down. Her legs, and right where her legs meet her back. Actually, that whole area. That, and above it. Six Gurtslers crammed under every cooling drive... so that you strain your primary artery function... and you end up having to recycle secondary exhaust through a bypass system... just so's you don't end up pumping it through the main atmofeed... and asphyxiating the entire crew. Now, that's junk. Have you seen what she wears? Forget about it. Have you ever been with a warrior woman? Pirates. Pirates with their own chaplain. There's an oddity. Not the only oddity this end of space, Commander... where things aren't always so plain as on the central planets. Rules can be a mite fuzzier. These fugitives that we're looking for, the brother and the sister. - They were last seen on Persephone. - That a fact? They also left port aboard a Firefly-class transport... just about the same time that you shipped out with Serenity. Well, Persephone's a big place. Yes. Yes, it is. And that Firefly isn't. And if anyone's hiding anywhere on it... we will find them. So, I figure by now you been over to the derelict, seen for yourself. Yes. Terrible thing. If you want my advice, you won't tow it back. Just fire the whole gorram thing from space, be done with it. That ship is evidence. I'm not in the habit of destroying evidence. Course not. Be against the rules. I'm gonna make a leap here... and figure this is your first tour out here on the border. It's a very loyal crew you have there. But then, I can tell by your record... you have a... a tendency to inspire that quality in people... Sergeant. It's not sergeant. Not anymore. War's over. For some, the war'll never be over. I notice your ship's called Serenity. You were stationed on Hara at the end of the war. Battle of Serenity Valley took place there, if I recall. I believe you might be right. Independents suffered a pretty crushing defeat there. Some say that after Serenity the browncoats were through... that the war ended in that valley. Seems odd you'd name your ship after a battle you were on the wrong side of. May have been the losing side. Still not convinced it was the wrong one. Is that why you attacked that transport? - What? - You're still fighting the same battle. Only those weren't soldiers you murdered. They were civilians, families, citizens loyal to the Alliance... trying to make a new life, and you just can't stand that, can you? So we attacked that ship, then brought the only survivor to our infirmary. Is that what we did? I'd ask him... only I'm not sure he'll be able to speak with his tongue split down the middle. I haven't seen that kind of torture since... well, since the war. - I should have known. - You and your crew are bound by law. Formal charges will be transmitted to central authority. Commander, I'm not what you need to be concerned about right now. Things go the way they are, there's gonna be blood. Get him down! Let's start the pressure. Get a line in. Go. - All right. - Come on, go. Reavers? That is what I said. You can't imagine how many times men in my position hear that excuse... Reavers did it. - It's the truth. - You saw them, did you? - Wouldn't be sittin' here talkin' to you if I had. - No, of course not. I'll tell you who did... that poor bastard you took off my ship. He looked right into the face of it and was made to stare. - It. - The darkness. The kind of darkness you can't even imagine. Blacker than the space it moves through. Very poetic. They made him watch. He probably tried to turn away. They wouldn't let him. You call him a survivor. He's not. A man comes up against that kind of will... the only way to deal with it, I suspect, is to become it. He's following the only course left to him. First he'll try to make himself look like one. Cut on himself, desecrate his flesh. And then... he'll start actin' like one. Let's have two M.P.s up here to escort Sergeant Reynolds to the brig. Let's go again. Later... maybe. The captain said once the coast is clear... we should lay low in the shuttle. - Come on. - Coming back. Yes. Yes, of course he is. They all are. Your ship and its contents will be auctioned. The proceeds of the sale will be applied to the cost of your defense. Get him out of here. Go to full lockdown. I want guards on the nursery. It won't matter. You won't find him. But I know where he'll go. Wait, no. Don't. Don't. River, it's okay. Wait. Wait... here. They've gone. Come on. - Don't... - River, it's okay. No. - Come on. - No. Don't... You don't have to be afraid. Why would he come back here? Looking for familiar ground. He's on the hunt. All right, let's get him to the brig. - No, no, no. I should go with you. - That's out of the question. How many more men you feel like losing today, Commander? Nobody knows Serenity like I do. I can help you. We let him go first. Right. You want to... Thanks. Now I'll really have the advantage. We don't know how long it's going to be. I don't think we should move around much. I'm just gonna grab some food... Someone's coming. You save his gorram life. He still takes the cargo. He had to. Couldn't let us profit. Wouldn't be civilized.
