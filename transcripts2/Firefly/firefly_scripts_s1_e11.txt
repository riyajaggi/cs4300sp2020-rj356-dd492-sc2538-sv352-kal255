 Sarge, Command says air support is holding until they can assess status. Status? We need air support. Tell them to get in here. That skiff is shredding us. They won't move without a lieutenant's authorization code, sir. Here's your code. You're Lieutenant Baker. Congratulations on your promotion. Now, get me some air support! Pull back far enough to wedge them in here. - Get to high ground, pick them off. - Not with that skiff in the air. That's our problem. Thanks for volunteering. Bendis... ...give us some cover fire. We're going duck hunting. You just focus!

 The Alliance said they were gonna waltz through Serenity Valley. And we choked them with those words. We've done the impossible, and that makes us mighty. Just a little longer, our angels will sow rain and fire on those arrogant cons... ...so you hold. You hold! Go! - Really think we can bring her down, sir? - You even need to ask? - Ready? - Always. Bendis. Bendis! Yeah! Zoe! Nice cover fire. Did you see that? Green, what's our status on...?

 Zoe. Hey, listen to me. Bendis, look at me. Listen. We're holding, no matter what. - We're gonna die. - We're not gonna die. We can't die, Bendis. You know why? Because we are so very pretty. We are just too pretty for God to let us die. Look at that chiseled jaw. Come on. If you won't listen to me, listen to that. Those are our angels, blow the Alliance to the hot place. - Zoe, tell the 82nd... - They're not coming. Command says it's too hot. They're pulling out. We're to lay down arms. But, what's...? The vault's sealed. Okay, I'm gonna boil it. Jayne, give me the sticky. Okay, we get the goods, we're off this wreck and back on the ship. No worries. Everything looks good from here. Yes. Yes. This is a fertile land and we will thrive. We will rule over all this land and we will call it... ..."This Land". I think we should call it your grave. Curse your sudden, but inevitable betrayal. Mine is an evil lair. Now die! Oh! No, God! Dear God in heaven. Oh, motherly son of a... Full pressure. The goods must be intact. Okay. Looking good. Captain, we got incoming. Alliance crews are bearing down on us. Have they spotted us? - I can't tell if... - Have they hailed us? If they want the salvage, we're humped. If they find us at all, we're humped... Wash, shut it down. Now. Everything but the air. Kaylee. Kaylee. Go to blackout, we're being buzzed. Going dark. Okay, now I can't get down. So, what am I looking at? A carrier, blew out a few months back. Lost all hands, but it was only run by a skeleton crew anyway. Damn shame. No point in checking for survivors? - Wash, they slowing down? - That's a neg. Doesn't look like they're interested in us. We should be eating wake in a minute. Sir, there is a reading on that thing. Some residual heat. Do a sweep. - Captain, we're humped. - Prep the ship, now. We move these in, double time. Kaylee, fire it up. It's a transport ship, Firefly class. - They still make those? - Illegal salvage. Lowlife vultures picking flesh off the dead. Should we deploy gunships and bring her in? Do it. Cry, baby, cry. Make your mother sigh. Engaging the crybaby. Captain, I am picking up a distress signal 13 clicks ahead from a... Sounds like a personnel carrier. Definitely a big ship, sir. And she's without power. Wash, we're on. Go. Hang on, travelers. Let's moon them. They're rabbiting. Should we continue deployment? Our gunships would never get back to us in time. Let's go help these people. But put out a bulletin on the cortex and flag Interpol. A Firefly with possible stolen goods on board. Maybe somebody will step on those roaches. We look shiny, captain. They are not, repeat, not coming about. Close one. Anyone you walk away from, right? Long as we got the goods, I call this a win. Right. We win. Well, there we are. - They're awfully pretty. - I'd say worth a little risk. Yeah, that was some pretty risky sit you did there. Of course. Because they wouldn't arrest me if we got boarded. I'm just the pilot. I could say I was flying the ship by accident. They're pretty unreas... Problem, sir? Couldn't say. We best be getting rid of these before we run into another Alliance patrol. What are they doing out this far, anyhow? Shining the light of civilization. How long until we reach Persephone? - Three or four hours. - Can we shave that? We're down to the wire on fuel cells. We run hot, we might not even make it. Play it close as you can. This cash is burning a hole in my hull. - Think that cruiser might've ID'd us? - Let's hope not. Contact Badger, tell him the job's done. Don't go to mentioning the cruiser, though. Keep it simple. - Sure there's nothing wrong with the... - It's fine. Just want to get paid. Let's get these crates stowed. I don't want any tourists stumbling over them. We're taking on passengers? Yeah, that's the notion. Could use a little respectability on the way to Boros. Not to mention the money. - Pain in the ass. - No, it's shiny. I like to meet new people. They've got stories. Captain, can you stop her from being cheerful, please? There's no power in the 'verse that can stop Kaylee from being cheerful. Sometimes you want to tape her mouth and... ...dump her in the hole for a month. I love my captain. I know something ain't right. Sweetie, we're crooks. If everything were right we'd be in jail. - It's just that the captain's so tense. - The man needs a break. In fact, we could all use a couple of days leave. We still gotta drop the goods. And when we do, we'll fly off to Boros, rich and prosperous. Well, less poor, but with enough to find some sweet little getaway. Oh, wouldn't mind a real bath. And a meal that included some form of food. Just a couple of days lying around. You with the bathing. - Me with the watching you bathe. - Lf the captain says it's all right. What if we just told Mal we need a couple of days instead of asking him? - He's the captain, Wash. - Right. I'm just the husband. Look, I'll ask him. Don't forget to call him "sir". He likes that. Who likes what? It's nothing, sir. - Has the ambassador checked in yet? - No. She had a pretty full docket. After you talk to Badger, tell her we may leave Persephone in a hurry. Inara has our timetable. She'll check in. I could tell her to cut it short. No, no. Don't want to get in her way if we don't have to. Somebody on this boat has to make an honest living. Oh, my God. Zenon isn't that different from this planet. More crowded, obviously, and I guess more complicated. The Great City itself is... Pictures can't capture it. It's like an ocean of light. Is that where you studied to be a companion? I was born there. I can't imagine ever leaving. Well, I wanted to see the universe. Do you really have to leave? I mean... ...my father is very influential. We could, I could arrange for you to be... The experience has been more than... It was very good. - Thank you. - The time went too quickly. Your clock's probably rigged to speed up and cheat us out of our fun. Serenity, this is Shuttle 1. What's your ETA? Inara, hey. We're touching down at the Eavesdown docks... ...in about ten minutes. - I'll join you there. Thanks. Looking forward to it. We missed you out here. Yeah, me too. This shouldn't take too long. Best time for departure, in about three hours. Gravity supplies we're low on, fuel her up. I'd love to find a brand-new compression core for the steamer. I'd like to be king of Ondinia. Just get us some passengers. Them as can pay. All right? - Compression core busts, we're drifting. - Let's not bust then. Zoe. We will. You want a trip, Grandpa? You need safe passage? We're cheap, we're clean. Brutus, best ship in the 'verse. What's your des, Grandpa? - We're hitting the outer rings. - I never married. What? I'm not a grandpa. Let me see your teeth. Yes. - You're late. - You're lying. What did you just say to me? You're aware we landed two hours before we planned... ...with all the goods intact, ready to roll. It's your decision to get touchy, say we're late. Means you're looking to put us on the defensive... ...which means something's gone wrong. Didn't go wrong on our end. So why don't we start again with you telling us what's up. - You're later than I'd like. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that. If you'd gotten here sooner... ...you might have beaten the bulletin that came up saying: "Rogue vessel. Classification, Firefly. Was spotted pulling illegal salvage on a derelict transport". - Didn't ID us. Doesn't lead to you. - No, it doesn't. But a government stamp on every molecule of the cargo just maybe might. Oh, you noticed that. You were gonna hand over imprinted goods and let me twist? - We didn't pick the cargo. - And I didn't flash my arse at the law. There's no deal. That ain't fair. Crime and politics, little girl, the situation is always fluid. The only thing fluid I see here is the puddle of piss refusing to pay our wage. It doesn't have to go this way. You know you can still unload those goods... ...so I think something else is at work here. What were you in the war? That big war you failed to win. You were a sergeant, yeah? Sergeant Malcolm Reynolds. Balls and bayonets brigade. Big tough veteran. Now you got yourself a ship and you're a captain. Only I think you're still a sergeant, see? Still a soldier. Man of honor in a den of thieves. Well, this is my gorram den... ...and I don't like the way you look down on me. I'm above you. Better than. Businessman, see? Roots in the community. You're just a scavenger. Well, maybe I'm not a fancy gentleman like you with your... ...very fine hat... ...but I do business. - We're here for business. - Try one of the border planets. They're a lot more desperate there. Of course, they might kill you. But you stay here, and I just know the Alliance will track you down. I have that feeling. Wheel never stops turning, Badger. That only matters to the people on the rim. You're gonna come with us. Excuse me? You like ships. You don't seem to be looking at the destinations. What you care about is the ships and mine's the nicest. - She don't look like much. - Oh, she'll fool you. - You ever sail in a Firefly? - Long before you were crawling. Not an Aught 3, though. It didn't have the extenders. Tended to shake. So how come you don't care where you're going? Because how you get there's the worthier part. Are you a missionary? I guess. I'm a shepherd from the South Down Abbey. Book. I'm called Book. Been out of the world for a spell. Like to walk it a while. Maybe bring the word to them that need it told. Well, I'm Kaylee. And this here's Serenity. And she's the smoothest ride from here to Boros for anyone who can pay. Can you pay, or...? Well, I got a little cash and... Ooh. Grandpa. I never married. I don't understand why we didn't leave him in a pool of his own blood. We'd be dead. Can't get paid if you're dead. Can't get paid if you crawl away like a little pug. I got a share of this job. Ten percent of nothing is... Let me do the math. Nothing and then nothing... - So we find a buyer on Boros. - Boros is too big. The Alliance could just be waiting for us. You think Badger would sell us to the Feds? If he hasn't already. If Alliance catches us, we'll lose the ship. - That's never gonna happen. - Sir... ...we could just dump the cargo. - No way. We ain't had a job in weeks. I didn't sign on to take in the sights. We need coin... Your mouth is talking. You might wanna look to that. - I'm ready to stop when... - You're right, though. Last two jobs we had were weak tea. We got nothing saved. Taking on passengers won't help near enough. We don't get paid for this cargo, we don't have enough money for fuel... ...let alone keep and repair. We should be dead in the water. - So we do the border planets? - I'm thinking Whitefall, talk to Patience. - We don't want to deal with Patience. - Why not? - She shot you. - Well, yeah, she did a bit. Still... - So we find somebody else. Horowitz. - He can't afford it. - Holden Boys. - They wouldn't touch it. I'll go through the list. Capshaws are brain-blown. Gruvick's dead. - He's dead? - Town got hit by Reavers, burned it. I ain't going near Reaver territory. Them people... Whitefall is the safest and the closest. It's a long time since Patience shot me... ...and that was due to a legitimate conflict of interest. I got no grudge. She owns half that damn moon now. She could afford what we got and might need it. - I still don't think the old lady's the way. - I'm not saying it won't be tricky. We got no kind of choice. - Welcome aboard, Mr... - Dobson. Just gotta keep our heads down, do the job, and pray there ain't no surprises. Please be careful with that. Mal, this is Simon. Simon, this is our captain. Captain Reynolds. Welcome aboard. This all we got? Now we have a boat full of citizens right on top of our stolen cargo. That's a fun mix. Ain't no way in the 'verse they could find that compartment, even... Even if they were looking for it. Why not? Because. Oh, yeah. This is gonna go great. If anyone gets nosy, you know, just shoot them. - Shoot them? - Politely. Inara, just in time. Let me guess, we're in a hurry? Looks like. Starboard hatch green for docking. Locked in five, four... The ambassador has returned. You got a full house, captain. Kaylee, I'm locking it up! All aboard. Meals are taken up here in the dining area. Kitchen's self-explanatory. You're welcome to eat what there is. Pretty standard fare, I guess. Protein in all the colors of the rainbow. We do have sit-down meals, next one being at about 1800. I think Shepherd Book has offered to help me prepare something. - You're a shepherd? - I thought the outfit gave it away. - Is it a problem? - Of course not. - It's no problem, because it's not. - No. As I said, you're welcome to visit the dining area anytime. Apart from that, I ask you to stay in the passenger dorm while we're in the air. The bridge, engine room, cargo bay, are off-limits without an escort. Some of my personal effects are in the cargo bay. You all got luggage you need to get into. We'll be happy to fetch them with you. Now, I have to tell you one other thing, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We've been ordered by the Alliance to drop medical supplies on Whitefall. It's the fourth moon on Athens. It's out of our way... ...but we'll get you on Boros no more than a day off schedule. What medical supplies? - I honestly didn't ask. - Probably plasma, insulin. Whatever they ain't got enough of on the border moons. - Alliance says "jump". - All right. - You wanna take them to the cargo bay? - Yes, sir. Anything else you need, just ask. We live to serve. - Did you send word to Patience? - Ain't heard back yet. - Didn't she shoot you one time? - Everybody's making a fuss. Oops. I'm sorry. Thank you. Ooh, ow. Ah! The ambassador graces us with her presence. Hello, Mal. I see we have some new faces. - Hey, you. - Hey, you. Ambassador, this is Shepherd Book. I'd have to say this is the first time we've had a preacher on board. Well, I wasn't expecting to see a state official, either. Ambassador. - I'm missing something funny. - Not so funny. - "Ambassador" is Mal's way of saying... - She's a whore, Shepherd. - The term is "companion". - I get those mixed up. - How's business? - None of yours. She is, pretty much, our ambassador. Plenty of planets wouldn't let you dock without a decent companion on board. This isn't a problem for you, is it, Shepherd? - Well, I certainly... - It's all right. I mostly keep to myself. When I'm not whoring. Don't you want to meet the rest of the bunch? Why don't you make sure they want to meet me first. So how many fell in love with you and wanted to take you away from all this? Just the one. I think I'm slipping. - I'm starving. - This is incredible. - It is great. - It's not much. I had a garden at the abbey... ...thought I'd bring what I could. - It's kind of you to share. It won't last. They're not the same frozen. - Pass the tomatoes. - The important thing is the spices. A man can live on packaged food from here until Judgment Day... ...if he's got enough rosemary. Captain, you mind if I say grace? Only if you say it out loud. So does it happen a lot? Government commandeering your ship, telling you where to go? It's what governments are for. Get in a man's way. It's good if the supplies are needed. We're just happy to be doing good works. I hear a lot of the border moons are in bad shape: Plagues and famine. Some of it is exaggerated and some of it ain't. All those moons, just like the central planets... ...they're as close to Earth as we can make them. Gravity, atmosphere, but... Once they're terraformed, they'll dump settlers there with nothing... ...but blankets, hatchets, maybe a herd. Some of them make it. Some of them... Then I guess it's good we're helping. You're a doctor, right? Oh, uh... Yes, I was a trauma surgeon on Osiris and Capital City. Long way from here. You seem so young to be a doctor. Yeah. - You're young to be a ship's mechanic. - Know-how. Machine's just got workings and they talk to me. That's a rare gift. Well, not like being a doctor. Helping fix people, that's important. Kaylee here just wishes you was a gynecologist. Jayne, you will keep a civil tongue in that mouth or I will sew it shut. - Do we have an understanding? - You don't pay me to talk pretty. Just because Kaylee gets lubed up over some big-city... Walk away from this table. Right now. What do you pay him for? - What? - I was just wondering what his job is. On the ship. Public relations. If I'm intruding... Not at all. I expected you. I couldn't really say the same. So would you like to lecture me on the wickedness of my ways? I brought you some supper. But if you'd prefer a lecture... ...I have a few very catchy ones prepped. - Sin and hellfire. One has lepers. - I think I'll pass. Thank you for this. The captain said you might like it. - I was surprised at his concern. - For a lowly whore? It was unjust of him to say that. Believe me, I've called him worse. Anyway, I suspect he has more interest in making you uncomfortable than me. He's not wildly interested in ingratiating himself with anyone. Yet he seems very protective of his crew. It's odd. Why are you so fascinated by him? Because he's something of a mystery. Why are you? Because so few men are. Mal, you might want to get up here. What is it? A signal. Somebody hailed the nearest Alliance cruiser. - Tell me you scrambled it. - To hell. I don't know how much got through. Alliance got a pin in us for sure. We got a mole on board. Forget your toothpaste? - Are you out of your mind? - Just about. - What did you tell them? - Tell who? I got exactly no time for games. What do they know? - You're a lunatic. - And you're a gorram Fed. I hate to say it, captain... ...but you've got the wrong man. - Son of a bitch. - Drop that firearm, Captain Reynolds. This is not my best day ever. Simon Tam, you are bound by law to stand down. What? The doctor? Hey, is there a reward? Get on the ground. - Get on the ground! - Lawman, you are making a mistake. You best get on the ground. The man seems twitchy. I think everybody could stand to calm down a bit. - This isn't your business, Shepherd. - The boy's not going anywhere, lawman. As I understand it, it's pretty cold outside. No worry. Put Lord Fauntleroy here in one of the passenger cells. Get the hell away from that weapon! You think I'm a complete back-birth? You're carrying a fugitive across interplanetary borders. And you think I believe you're bringing medical supplies to Whitefall? As far as I care, everyone on this ship is culpable. Well, now... ...that has an effect on the landscape. - Please. We're close to true stupidity. A cruiser's en route, so talk all you want. You got about 20 minutes. - Might have less than that. - Yeah, threaten me. - For God's sake. - Think I won't shoot a shepherd? Back! - Just take him. - Get the hell down! - What is...? Stop it! - What...? - Kaylee! How do you feel? - A little odd. - Be still. - Out of the way. - You're not killing this man. - Not right away. - He's no threat. - What did he...? - Oh, whoa. - That ain't hardly a mosquito bite. - Big mosquito. - Move. - Not gonna happen. - I ain't joking with you, preacher. - Jayne! Just tie him up. Do it. Kaylee, stay with me. Stay with me. Can you move your feet? - Are you asking me to dance? - She's going into shock. Kaylee, you have to focus. The gun, shepherd. Please. - The infirmary working? - Yeah, we got it stocked. We've been hailed by a cruiser... ...ordered to stay on course and dock for prisoner transfer. - Change course. Run. - Hell with you. You brought this. I'm dumping you with the law. She's dying. - You're not gonna let her. - Yes, I am. - No. You can't. - The Feds won't let us walk. - We dump him in a shuttle. Leave him. - Everybody's so mad. - It's okay. - Know what that wound does? - I surely do. - The next few minutes are crucial. You let her die, you'll never make it to the Feds. She'll still be dead. You rich kids think your lives are the only thing that matters. What'd you do? Kill your folks for the family fortune? - I don't kill people. - Then do your job. - Turn this ship around. - Enough! Mal, do it. Don't you ever tell me what to do... Zoe, change course. Help me get her up. Wash, change course and go for hard burn. We're running. - You have an extractor? - Got a laser saw. That's not good enough. My room, red bag. When this is over, you and me will have a chat. Won't that be fun. Dope her. Can't do any more until she stabilizes. Will she? I can't say yet. I want to know what's going on here. - Well, then, why don't we find out. - No! No! Stay away from that. Where's the Fed? Secured. Shepherd's with him. Seems to think he's not safe alone with me. No. Well, let's see what a man like you would kill for. No, don't! Huh. I need to check her vitals. - Is that what they call it? - She's not to wake. The shock... The shock of what? Waking up? Finding out she's been sold to some border world baron? I'm sorry, was this one for you? Is it true love? Because you do seem a little... River. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. Simon. Simon, they talked to me. They want me to talk... They're gone. They're gone. They're gone. We're safe now. We're safe. We're safe. I'm here. What the hell is this? This is my sister. I am very smart. I went to the best medic-ad on Osiris. Top three percent of my class. Finished my internship in eight months. Gifted is the term. So when I tell you that my little sister makes me look like an idiot child... ...I want you to understand my full meaning. River was more than gifted. She was a gift. Everything she did: Music, math, theoretical physics, even dance... ...there was nothing that didn't come as naturally to her as breathing does to us. And she could be a real brat about it too. I mean, she used to... There was a school... ...a government-sponsored academy. We had never even heard of it, but it had the most exciting program. The most challenging. We could've sent her anywhere, we had the money, but she wanted to go. She wanted to learn. She was 14. I got a few letters at first, and then I didn't hear for months. Finally, I got a letter that made no sense. She talked about things that never happened. Jokes that we never... It was a code. It just said: "They're hurting us. Get me out". How'd you do it? Money. And luck. For two years I couldn't get near her. Then I was contacted by some men, some underground movement. They said that she was in danger... ...that the government was playing with her brain. If I funded them, they'd sneak her out, get her to Persephone... ...and from there, I could take her wherever. Will she be all right? I don't know if she'll be all right. I don't know what they did to her. Or why. I just have to keep her safe. - That's quite a story, son. - Yeah. It's a tale of woe. Stirring. But in the meantime, you heaped a world of trouble on us... - I never thought... - I don't imagine you thought. In consequence, we got a kidnapped Fed on board. We got the Alliance on our trail. And Kaylee... - How much does the Alliance know? - Can't say. I killed the message, so maybe just our position. Or they might have personal profiles on each of us. - Till that Fed wakes up, we won't know. - So, what do we do? The job. I got word from Patience, she's waiting for us. We circle around to Whitefall, make the deal, get out. Keep flying. What about us? Kaylee comes through, you and your sister get off at Whitefall. If she doesn't come through? Then you're getting off a mite sooner. - That'd be murder. - Boy made a decision. - He didn't shoot her. - No, somebody else did... ...and why ain't we dealt with him? - Kill a Fed? Can you think of a stupider... - He can ID us all. - Throw me out. But River is not a part... - Can we vote on the murdering issue? We don't vote on my ship. It's not the town hall. - This is insanity. - I think we're beyond that now, sir! - We'll talk this through, yeah? - I'll not sit by while there's killing here. The way it is is the way it is. We gotta deal with what's in front of us. Mal, you know those two wouldn't survive a day in Whitefall anyway. You throw them out, I'm leaving too. It might be best you do. You ain't a part of this business. What business is that, exactly? I'm a dead man. I can't know? Is it gold? Drugs? Pirate treasure? What is it that makes you so afraid of the Alliance? You don't want to go down this road with me, boy. Are you not afraid of them? I already know you'd sell me out to them for a pat on the head. Hell, you should probably be working for them. You certainly fit the profile... Saw that coming. I'm in a tricky position. I guess you know. Got me a boatload of strange folk... ...making my life a little more interesting than I generally like. Chief among them, an Alliance mole who likes to shoot at girls when he's nervous. I gotta know how close the Alliance is... ...exactly how much you told them before Wash scrambled your call. So... ...I've given Jayne here the job of finding out. He was non-specific as to how. You're only gonna scare him. - Pain is scary. - Just do it right. Any idea how much trouble you're in? - Never been in trouble with the law. - No, not like this. You think this is just a smuggling rap? - The package that boy's carrying... - It's a girl. She's cute too. Except I don't think she's all there, you know? - Of course, not all of her has to be. - She's a precious commodity. They'll come after her. Long after you bury me, they'll be coming. I'm not gonna kill you, Dobson. What's your first name? Lawrence. Lawrence, I'm just gonna cut on you until you tell me how much they know. They know everything. Every name, every record, how many... ...nose hairs you've got. See, they don't know a damn thing. It's all over your face. I ain't even... I was gonna get me a ear too. Aren't you an officer of the law? Don't they teach you to withstand interrogation? You can't even tell a damn lie. Okay, I can see you're not an idiot. Wish I could say the same, Lawrence, but this is disappointing as hell. Let me speak a language you will understand: Money. This girl is worth a lot of money. I mean, a lot. Now, you kill me, there's nothing. But if you help me out... ...you'll have enough to buy your own ship. Better one than this piece of crap. Does helping you out mean turning on the captain? Yes, it does. How the hell did they find us? - It's not Alliance. - You sure? - It's a smaller vessel. - Commercial? - Yes. I read it as an older model Trans-U. - I didn't think Trans-U still operated. They don't. Get me visual. - They're still too far out. - Get me something. I'm picking up a lot of radiation. They're operating without core containment. That's... That's suicide. Reavers. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. This is the captain. We're passing another ship. Looks to be Reavers. In size, probably a raiding party. Could be they're headed somewhere particular. Could be they already hit someone and they're full up, so everyone stay calm. If we try to run, they'll have to chase us. It's their way. We're holding course. We should be passing them in a minute... ...so we'll see what they do. Zoe, you come on up to the bridge. - I don't understand. - You never heard of Reavers? Campfire stories. Men gone savage on the edge of space. Killing... They're not stories. What happens if they board us? If they take the ship... ...they'll rape us to death, eat our flesh and sew our skins into their clothing. And if we're very, very lucky, they'll do it in that order. There's a magnetic grappler. - They get ahold of us with that. - Tell me if they hold their course. They're holding course. I guess they weren't hungry. Didn't expect to see them here. They're pushing out further every year too. Getting awful crowded in my sky. Hey, captain. Hey. Hello, Kaylee. What's the news? I'm shiny, captain. A-Okay. I can't feel much below my belly, though. It's getting cold. Well, you just gotta rest. Something will break down on this boat soon. Who else I got to fix it? Don't you worry none. Doc fixed me up pretty. He's nice. Don't go working too hard on that crush. Doc won't be with us for long. You're nice too. No, I'm not. I'm a mean old man. He wasn't gonna let me die. He was just trying to... It's nobody's fault. Okay? Just promise me you're gonna remember that. I'll keep it in mind. You are a nice man, captain. You're always looking after us. You just gotta have faith in people. She's a real beauty, isn't she? It's a standard companion immunization package. - I'm not sure it'll help... - It won't hurt. - Supplies down there are rudimentary. - Is there anything else I can do? - I don't think so, but I appreciate it. - Kaylee's very dear... ...to all of us. I'm sorry. For my part in what happened. I've never... - I mean, I don't know how to... - You're lost in the woods. We all are. Even the captain. The only difference is he likes it that way. No, the only difference is the woods are the only place I can see a clear path. - What's your business here? - It's my business. The usual. I gave the boy a free thrust since he's not long for this world. - What are you doing in my shuttle? - It's my shuttle. You rent it. Then when I'm behind on the rent, you can enter unasked. I thought you were leaving, anyhow. Well, I guess that depends on you. You ruin her, too, you know. This is the thing I see you're uncomprehending on. Everyone on this ship... ...even a legitimate businesswoman like her... ...their lives can be snatched away because of that Fed. You got a solution for that? You got a way around? I don't. Comes time, someone will have to deal with him. That should be you. But I don't think you got the guts. And I know you don't have the time. What do you mean? Kaylee's dead. The man's psychotic. You are psychotic. No, you should have seen his face. - I'm a bad man. - And Kaylee's really okay? Yeah. I didn't expect her to heal this quick. Doctor knows his trade, I'll give him that. - We're being hailed. - That would be Patience. We're close enough for vid, put her up. - Malcolm Reynolds? - Hello, Patience. I have to say, I didn't look to be hearing from you anytime soon. Well, we may not have parted on the best of terms. I realize certain words were exchanged, also certain bullets. That's air through the engine. It's past. We're business people. Your days of fighting over salvage are behind you. - What are you, mayor now? - Just about. You telling the truth about that cargo? Your asking price is a bit too reasonable for that much treasure. It's imprinted, hence the discount. Government goods, huh? If that doesn't work for you, no harm... Alliance don't scare me. Just collating data, as they say. I like that you're up-front about it. We can deal. I left load coordinates for a rendezvous outside of town. See you in the world. I believe she's planning to shoot me again. If she meant to pay, she'd have haggled you down. Just a little effort to hide it would've been... - Sir, we don't have to deal with her. - Yes, we do. Here's a concept I been working on. Why don't we shoot her first? It is her turn. - Doesn't get us what we need. - There's moons here we ain't seen. - We could try our luck... - Our luck? You notice anything particular about our luck these past few days? Any kind of pattern? You depend on luck, you end up on the drift. No fuel, no prospects... ...begging for Alliance make-work. Getting towed out to the scrap belt. That ain't us. Not ever. Patience has got the money to pay and she will, one way or another. There's obstacles in our path and we'll deal with them one by one. We'll get through this. We will. - Nice place for an ambush. - That it is. Here you are. I buried them good. Equipment's back on the boat. Testing. - Testing, captain. Can you hear me? - I'm right here. - You're coming through good and loud. - Because I'm right here. But the transmitter's... Patience is gonna figure we buried the cargo... ...which means putting us to our ease before there's any action. She'll come at us from the east... ...talk the location out of us. She'll have a coin to show us first. We get it, give the location... ...snipers hit us from there and there. - You figure they're in place yet? - Should be. Feel like taking a walk around? You don't want to piss yourself and back down like you did with Badger? Walk soft. I want Patience thinking they're still in place. Don't kill anyone you don't have to. We're here to make a deal. Don't think it's a good spot, sir. She still has the advantage over us. Everyone always does. That's what makes us special. Lawman. It's Shepherd Book. I believe you're in more danger... Mal. How you doing, boy? Walking and talking. Is that Zoe? You still sailing with this old bum? Awful lot of men to haul three crates. Well, I couldn't be sure my Mal here wouldn't be looking for some payback. You understand. We're just on the job, not interested in surprises. I don't see my cargo anywhere. You won't, until I'm holding 200 in platinum. Come on, Reynolds. I'm supposed to take it on faith that you got the goods? It's pure, Patience. Genuine A-grade foodstuffs. Protein, vitamins, immunization supplements. One would feed a family for a month. - Longer if they don't like their kids. - Yep, that's the stuff. So where's the rest? Simon? What's wrong, sweetie? Look at you, all woke up. Sorry about what happened before, but make a sound... ...the next one goes through your throat. East half a mile, bottom of the first hill, you'll see where it's been dug. I reckon I will. Well, then... Yep. I'd appreciate it if you all turn around and ride out first. Well, you see, there's a kind of hitch. We both made out on this. Don't complicate things. I got a rule. I never let go of money I don't have to. Which is maybe why I'm running this little world... ...and you're still on that dinky old boat sniffing for scraps. Got the money back. There's no need for killing. - We're just gonna walk away? - That's up to Patience here. - Could be messy. - Not terribly. Mal, you just ain't very bright, are you? That's quite a rifle. Boy must be your best shot to carry that. He's called Two-Fry. Always makes it quick and clean. Two-Fry. Nice hat. You should ask the captain to drop you somewhere else. Whitefall ain't exactly civilization in the strictest sense. You don't have to worry about me. Zoe's out on a deal, I always worry. So... ...it's not out of my way. He took her. He took River. Don't. Don't you dare. Zoe. Armor's dented. You were right about this being a bad idea. - Thanks for saying. - Mal, don't you take another step! I did a job. Got nothing but trouble since, not to mention a few unkind words... ...as regard to my character, so let me make this abundantly clear. I do the job... ...and then I get paid. Go run your little world. Mal! It's Wash! We got ship coming in. They followed us! The Reavers followed us. No, don't! Don't move. Reavers! Reavers incoming... ...and heading straight for us. We are in the air in one minute. I guess they got hungry again. You can do that. You're gonna kill a lawman in cold blood? I know what you did for your sister. I understand. It doesn't make you a killer. I don't want to hurt anybody. I have a job to do. To uphold the law, that's what we're talking about here. Come on, come on. Where the hell are you guys? There's nowhere you can take her the law won't find. Nobody is going to hurt her. - Unless you hurt me. - No, I said! I said, don't move. It's your call. I'm not playing anymore. Anybody makes so much... Jayne! Wash, we're on! How close are they? - Twenty seconds from spitting distance. - Lose them. Give me vid. - How close do they need to be? - Come on, dodge them! If everyone could be quiet a moment. - I need Kaylee in the engine room. - Get her in there now. Get in your shuttle. Get the civilians ready to go. - I can't just leave you here. - That was the plan. - Mal, don't do this... - We get boarded, take off. - We might be able to stop them. - They'll kill you. Inara... Go. How we doing? I don't mean to alarm anybody... ...but I think we're being followed. You three, come with me. I think I can help Kaylee out. - Should I...? - Take her. Keep her safe. Can't keep this up. They're gonna lock us down. Kaylee, how we doing? Gonna need a little push here. You want me to go for full burn? Not just yet, but set it up. You know where the press regulator is? Head of the class. We're ready for full burn on your mark. Full burn in atmo? That won't burn us out? Even if it doesn't, they can push just as hard, keep right on us. Wash, you gotta give me an Ivan. I'll see what I can do. Kaylee, how would you feel about pulling a Crazy Ivan? Always wanted to try one. Jayne, open the port jack control, cut the hydraulics. - Where the hell is...? - Look. Look where I'm pointing. Okay. Now it's real simple. - They're on us. - Kaylee. Come on, come on, come on. Okay. Everybody hold on to something. Here's something you can't do. Now! I knew I hired you for something. Whoo! Ain't no way they can come around in time to follow us now. We're good, people. We're out of the woods. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! That's my girl. That's my good girl. We should have just enough left in us to hit a fuel station. We need to do some patching up. - I hope we got paid today. - We did. Sir, I'd like you to take the helm, please. I need this man to tear all my clothes off. Work, work, work. - You should have the doctor look at this. - It's not so bad. Well, I'm sure you'll be fine. I didn't say that. Is this what life is out here? Sometimes. I've been out of the abbey two days. I've beaten a lawman senseless... ...fallen in with criminals. I watched the captain shoot the man I swore to protect. And I'm not even sure if I think it was wrong. Shepherd. I believe I just... I think I'm on the wrong ship. Maybe. Or maybe you're exactly where you ought to be. - The shot I gave you will help you sleep. - I slept for so long. Just a little while. And then we'll find a place. We'll find a safe place. I didn't think you'd come for me. Well, you're a dummy. The girl's a problem. The lawman said they'd keep looking for her. Something about her special brain. Important to the Alliance brass. - Sooner we dump them two, the better. - Suppose so. Funny how the lawman got out of his room, you having tied him up and all. I didn't have nothing to do with that. Anyhow, it all turned out just fine. Buzzards are the only ones gonna find him. But he did try to make a deal with you, right? How come you didn't turn on me, Jayne? - Money wasn't good enough. - What happens when it is? Well, that'll be an interesting day. I imagine it will. You need me to look at that? Just a graze. So where do you plan on dumping us? Best place as you might be safe. The truth, though, you're probably safer on the move. And we never stop moving. I'm confused. No, wait, I think maybe you're confused. It may be apparent to you that the ship could use a medic. You ain't weak. Don't know how bright you are, top three percent... ...but you ain't weak and that's not nothing. You live by my rule, you keep your sister from doing anything crazy... ...you could maybe find a place here. Until you find a better. I'm trying to put this as delicately as I can. How do I know you won't kill me in my sleep? You don't know me, son, so let me explain this to you once. If I ever kill you, you'll be awake. You'll be facing me and you'll be armed. Are you always this sentimental? Had a good day. You had the Alliance on you... ...criminals and savages... ...half the people on this ship have been shot or wounded, including yourself... ...and you're harboring known fugitives. We're still flying. That's not much. That's enough.
