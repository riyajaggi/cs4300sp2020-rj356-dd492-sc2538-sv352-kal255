 Firefly (2002â€“2003): Season 1, Episode 10 - Objects in Space - full transcript 
 River has a daydream and holds one of Jayne's weapon believing it was a tree branch; suddenly she awakes and sees Mal and the crew scary. River overhears Mal and the crew discussing about her and she feels rejected. Meanwhile, the ruthless bounty hunter Jubal Early, who has tracked down River, boards the Serenity while everybody is sleeping. He subdues Mal and locks the crew in the cabins; ties Kaylee up in the engine room; hits Shepherd Book on the head; and he finally captures Simon to force him to deliver his sister. However River is missing and out of the blue, she tells through the communication system that she felt rejected and had melted away becoming part of Serenity. The skeptical Early does not believe first, but soon she is convinced she is telling the truth. What will happen to River?

 [ Voices Chattering ] [ Man ] We're all just floating. [ Kaylee ] You couldn't possibly. [ Simon ] No. I wish I was lying. I just,you know, we'd all just made surgeon. That was it. We were the elite. - The world was ours, you know. - So you had to be naked? Naked, yes. - And on top of the statue of Hippocrates. - [ Laughs ] - Can you just picture me? - What, naked? Uh, hmm, let's see. I'm gonna have to conjure up, uh--

 Yeah, that's, that's gonna be difficult. [ Laughing ] - So did the feds come? - There were no feds... until I started singing. - Oh, no! - No. This is not-- What did you sing? This is not funny. This-- This is a morality tale about the evils of sake. I would be there right now. I mean, it was, it was-- It was either that or the national anthem. Reports vary. [ Kaylee ] You don't remember any of this? I remember talking the feds out of telling my father... or paying the feds out of telling my father.

 - I get fuzzy on the aspects. - [ Kaylee Laughing ] - So, like, never? - Well, no. Not ever, never? Some orders allow shepherds to marry... but I follow a narrower path. But I mean, you still got the urge. They don't... cut it off or nothin'. No. I'm more or less intact. I just direct my energy elsewhere. You mean like masturbatin'? I hope you're not thinking of taking orders yourself. [ Laughs ] That'll be the day. I got stupid. The money was too good. I don't give half a hump if you're innocent or not. So where does that put you? - [ Laughing ] - Saint Jayne. It's got a ring to it. I'm just trying to remember how many miracles you've performed. I once hit a guy in the neck from 500 yards with a bent scope. - Don't that count upstairs? - Oh, it'll be taken into consideration. You made that sound kind of ominous. I put out a few waves to some old acquaintances. I may even be able to find something in New Melbourne if you need the shuttle free. I'm just gonna be there long enough to pick up cargo. The only thing you're gonna find in New Melbourne... is fish and fish-related activities... so unless you got the overwhelming urge to gut sturgeon... and who hasn't occasionally-- But it's a layover point for almost every planet this side of the system. I could-- I just don't wanna draw this out. Have you decided when you're gonna tell the others? I-- No. - I appreciate your not saying anything. - Well, I don't. So make up your mind. I'm a big girl. Just tell me. None of it means a damn thing. It's just an object. It doesn't mean what you think. - You know that's not to be touched. - Stay calm. Stop yelling at her. [ Mal ] River, sweetheart, you want nothin' to do with that. Put it down. - Kaylee. - What were you thinking? Where did you get ahold-- - It was in my hand. - I'm not mad. Just let me-- Thank you. Fully loaded, safety off. This here is a recipe for unpleasantness. - Does she understand that? - She understands. She doesn't comprehend. Well, I'm glad we've made that distinction. No touching guns, okay? No touching. - River-- - It's getting very, very crowded! I thought she was on the med. Her medications are erratic. There's not one that her system can't eventually break down and-- When I want a lot of medical jargon, I'll talk to a doctor. You are talking to a doctor. Yeah, okay. My point is it could've been you she might've shot just then-- the doctor, as you just made note of. And who exactly could fix you? Not nobody. We're deep in space, corner of No and Where. You take extra care with her... 'cause we're very much alone out here. ~ Take my love, take my land ~ ~ Take me where I cannot stand ~ ~ I don't care, I'm still free ~ ~ You can't take the sky from me ~ ~ Take me out to the black ~ ~ Tell them I ain't comin'back ~ ~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~ ~ You can't take the sky from me ~ ~ There's no place I can be ~ ~ Since I've found serenity ~ ~ But you can't take the sky from me ~~ Little River just gets more colorful by the moment. What'll she do next? Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. - It's a toss-up. - I hope she does the soup thing. It's always a hoot, and we don't all die from it. - Poor kid. - Yeah. She's definitely got-- - Funny. - Something wrong? I'm just getting a weird heat bounce off our wake. - Engine flux? - Sensors probably got turned around. Those lockers are sealed. Only way she can get in there is if she knows the combination. I don't leave my guns around, Mal, and I don't leave 'em loaded. Well, somehow, she got her hands on your hardware. Now, supposing she took up something with hull-piercing bullets. Bullets are soft lead, Mal. Even Vera could barely breach the hull. She's the best I got. Anyhow, let's move this conversation in a "notJayne's fault" direction. I didn't make her crazy. Hell, I didn't even want her on the ship. Is that the direction you want this conversation to go in? Just don't want to take a lashing for something I ain't the cause of. [ Zoe ] Where's River at now? In her room, which I'm thinking we bolt from the outside from now on. That's a little extreme, isn't it? - Anybody remember her coming at me with a butcher's knife? - Wacky fun. - You wanna go, little man? - Only if it's someplace with candlelight. Sir, I know she's unpredictable, but I don't think she'd harm anyone. - [Jayne ] Butcher's knife. - Anyone we can't spare. As far as we know, the girl's never even picked up a gun before. [ Kaylee ] That ain't so. Kaylee,you got somethin'to say? [ Mal ] Okay, Kaylee, why don't you speak your piece? It was when the captain and Wash got took by Niska. I ain't likely to forget that anytime soon. Well, we all went in-- me too-- Didn't make much account of myself, I'm afraid. I got no problem with the notion of you not killing nobody, Kaylee. What's this got to do with River? She wasn't even in that fight. Well, no, she was. I got pinned down... and there were three guys and I couldn't-- And then River comes up. She looks out, sees 'em all-- And they was spread out, you know, had some cover. She-- She only looked for a second and... took my gun... closed her eyes... killed 'em. - She shot them? - All three. Dead. In an instant. With her eyes still closed. That's-- [ Chinese ]. You saw it wrong. Not a jot. And it weren't auto fire or luck. She just-- - She just did the math. - You understand how that sounds? What? She killed 'em with mathematics. What else could it have been? You couldn't have done it, Jayne, nor you, Cap'n. Nobody can shoot like that that's a person. So River's not a person. [ Kaylee ] Oh, please don't be mad. [ Simon ] I just want to understand what you're saying here. - I thought River was your friend. - She is. But, Simon, the way she-- Right after, she looked at me and... she smiled... like nothing was wrong. Like we were playing. Scared me. Could be she saved your life, Kaylee. Oh, I'm all aware of that, and I'm not saying-- She probably didn't even know what was going on. Thought it was a game. Later on you can explain to me how that's a comfort. Might have to use some of that math we've been hearing about. What we got here to deal with is the larger issue, and that larger issue is... we got someone on board this ship might be a danger to us. Ain't a question of whether we like her. Some of us have grown attached to River. Kaylee, I know you have, or you would've spoken up sooner... which, by the by, you should have. I find River pleasant enough myself... but she does have an oddness to her. And I ain'tjust talking about her proficiency with firearms. Girl knows things-- things she shouldn't, things she couldn't. What, are you saying she's a witch? Yes, Jayne. She's a witch. - She has had congress with the beast. - She's in Congress? How did your brain even learn human speech? - I'm just so curious. - [ Speaking Chinese ] This isn't a joking matter. This is about our lives and River's. [ Mal ] Thank you. She's deeply intuitive. It's true that sometimes-- I don't think she's intuitive. I think she's a reader. - Psychic? - Is that even remotely possible? You tell me. You've been studying what they've done to her. They've, uh-- They definitely altered the way she reacts to things, even the way she perceives. - But I'm not-- - Psychic, though? That sounds like something out of science fiction. - We live in a spaceship, dear. - So? Whoa. Back up a sec. Are you saying she really reads minds? [ Mal ] Or near enough. - Am I alone thinking along these lines? - No. Well, I don't like the idea of someone hearing what I'm thinking. No one likes the idea of hearing what you're thinking. The Alliance could have any number of uses for a psychic. A psychic... or an assassin. She's just a kid. And she just wants to be... a kid. I wish it were that simple. Yeah, and if wishes were horses, we'd all be eatin' steak. What do we plan to do about this? Well, that's the question. I don't think she'd ever hurt any of us. Maybe you're right. I ain't gonna make a decision on anything till I thought on it awhile. It's late. Let's get some rest. - Simon-- - I gotta go check on my assassin. Oh, please don't be mad. I had to say something. I'm not mad at you. I just, uh-- She loves this ship. I think it's more home to her than any place she's been. Wh-What about you? I mean, I-- I thought the hospital was home. I was really making a difference there and-- and embarrassingly large stacks of money... and I could've-- I would be there right now, if she hadn't-- if-- if they had just left her alone. Is it so bad here? - I don't even know if the captain will let us-- - No. I mean... isn't there anything about this place you're glad of? Good night, you two. - I, uh-- - Don't. Yeah, I-- Good night. Don't let the space bugs bite. [ Sighs ] Space bugs. [ Air Hissing ] [ Cocks Gun ] [ Locking ] [ Door Unlocks ] [ Metal Creaks ] River? [ Metal Creaking ] River? [ Yelps ] I like this ship. Serenity. She's good-looking. H-How did you... get on? Strains the mind a bit, don't it? You think you're all alone. Maybe I come down the chimney, Kaylee. Bring presents to the good girls and boys. Maybe not, though. Maybe I've always been here. What do you want? [ Machinery Whirring ] That's her beating heart, isn't it? Pull off any one of a thousand parts, she'll just die. Such a slender thread. You ever been raped? The captain is right down that hallway. He can hear you. The captain's locked in his quarters. They all are. There's nobody can help you. Say it. There's-- There's nobody can help me. I'm gonna tie you up now. And you know what I'm gonna do then? I'm gonna give you a present. Get rid of a problem you've got. And I won't touch you in any wrong fashion, nor hurt you at all... unless you make some kind of ruckus. You throw a monkey wrench into my dealings in any way... your body is forfeit. Ain't nothing but a body to me... and I can find all unseemly manner of use for it. Do you understand? Yes. - Turn around and put your hands behind your back. - [ Whimpering ] Now tell me, Kaylee. Where does River sleep? Hello? [ Thud ] River? [ Cocks Gun ] Dr. Tam, why don't you sit yourself down? Rather die standing. Well, the intention is not for you to die. The warrant doesn't specify any particular need for you to be alive, but-- Where's your sister? - Are you Alliance? - Am I a lion? - What? - I don't think of myself as a lion. You might as well, though. I have a mighty roar. I said ''Alliance.'' Oh. I thought-- - No, I was-- - That's weird. - Where's your sister? - I don't know. Who do you work for? - This is her room. - Yes. - It's empty. - I know. So is it still her room when it's empty? Does the room, the thing, have purpose? Or do we-- What's the word? I really can't help you. The plan is to take your sister... get the reward, which is substantial. - "Imbue." That's the word. - So you're a bounty hunter. - No. That ain't it at all. - Then what are you? I'm a bounty hunter. I'm named Early. I'm known to some. Been tracking you since the feds were tipped off on Ariel. - She sleep with anybody? - River? Yeah. She grapple with any of the crew? - Might be in their quarters? - No. Maybe she does, and you don't know about it. This is insane. I'm not gonna help you find her, in any case. [ Sighs ] I think this is very pretty. I like the weight of it. I thought the intention was not to kill me. No. You're missing the point. The design of the thing... is functional. The plan is not to shoot you. The plan is to get the girl. If there's no girl, then the plan, well, is like the room. You are gonna help me look for her. I don't think my last act in this 'verse is gonna be betraying my sister. You're gonna help me. 'Cause every second you're with me is a chance to turn the tables... get the better of me. Maybe you'll find your moment. Maybe I'll slip. Or... you refuse to help me, I shoot your brain out... and I go upstairs and spend some time violating... the little mechanic I got trussed up in the engine room. I take no pleasure in the thought... but she will die weeping if you cross me. You're out of your mind. That's between me and my mind. Let's start with these rooms. [ Early ] He's not killed. Be a while before he comes to, but he'll mend. And which part of your plan dictated the necessity of beating up a shepherd? That ain't a shepherd. She wouldn't come in here anyway. She hates this room. You see, Early, the people you're planning to sell her to... cut up her brain in a lab like this. Tortured her. A teenaged girl. Not some bandit on a murder run. Just an innocent-- - You ever been shot? - No. You ought to be shot... or stabbed. Lose a leg. To be a surgeon, you know? Know what kind of pain you're dealing with. They make psychiatrists get psychoanalyzed before they can get certified... but they don't make a surgeon get cut on. That seem right to you? Come on out, River. - The nice man wants to kidnap you. - Shh! I like the way the walls go out. Gives you an open feeling. Firefly's a good design. People don't appreciate the substance of things. Objects in space. People miss out on what's solid. It's not your moment, Doctor. - Is that the Companion shuttle? - Yes. We'll try the empty first. Then we'll pay her a visit. Her room's not saying a damn thing. Hold it. This is pointless, you know that? Two hundred thousand seems fairly pointed to me. Money like that, I could retire. Not that I would. What's life without work? Serenity's a smuggling ship. I've been here a year. I couldn't name all the places she might hide. I don't have a year. Your sister's becoming a real annoyance. I feel for you. I'm not gonna waste my time threatening you... 'cause I think you believe I will kill people... if someone upsets my plan. I'm gonna seal you in, though. You just sit. You can still walk away from this. I know you're tired. Don't go visiting my intentions. Don't ever. Man is stronger by far than woman... yet only woman can create a child. Does that seem right to you? [ Door Closes ] All right. That's all the hide-and-seek I got time for. [ Early ] I know you're on this ship, little girl... so here's how this goes. You show yourself. We finish this exchange... or your brother's brains will be flying every which-a-way. You understand. I'm sort of on the clock here. It's frustrating. [ River's Voice ] You're wrong, Early. I'm not wrong, dumpling. I will shoot your brother dead if you don't-- Wrong about River. River's not on the ship. They didn't want her here... but she couldn't make herself leave. So she melted. Melted away. They didn't know she could do that, but she did. [ Early ] I'm not sure I take your meaning there. I'm not on the ship. I'm in the ship. I am the ship. - River-- - River's gone. Then who exactly are we talking to? You're talking to Serenity. And, Early, Serenity is very unhappy. [ River ] Kaylee. - River. - You're afraid. He tied me up. - I don't know where he came from. - It's okay. You're gonna be okay. I told him where you were. I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. - I-- - Shh. I'm fine. But I need you to do something for me. Gotta be brave. I'm tied up. I-I can't. Got tools. Something sharp. Don't be scared. I'm right here. Where'd she go? I can't keep track of her when she's not incorporeally possessing a spaceship. - Don't look at me. - That's some nonsensical crap. Ain't nobody can do that. You're somewhere on this boat. Somewhere with a com, playing games. [ River Giggling ] That's somewhat unsettling. Early. Mr.Jubal Early, bounty hunter. May I call you "Jubal"? Ain't nobody calls me that. Your mother does. I'm sorry. Did. She's gone now. Is that supposed to scare me, bringing up my mother? You're a liar. I don't think your intentions are honorable. Well, no. I'm a bounty hunter. It's not generally considered honorable, so much as-- - I live by a code, though, which I think is worth-- - You hurt people. Only when the job requires it. Wrong. You're a bad liar. You crawl inside me uninvited, and you hurt my crew. I see everything that passes-- I only hurt people 'cause they keep getting in the way of me finding you. Tell her. - What am I, your advocate? - You are, starting now. He's really very gentle and fuzzy. - We're becoming fast friends. - [ River Giggling ] You folks are all insane. Well, my sister's a ship. We had a complicated childhood. Doesn't anybody care that I have a finely crafted gun pointed at this boy's head? I care. Then you gonna come out and stop me from doing what I don't want to? You gonna be smart here, River? River? Serenity? [ Groans ] What the hell's going on here? [ River ] I need you to do me a favor, Captain. There was a guy. He's very blurry. You gotta be careful. [ Groans ] How come there's a guy on board... and how come you're all of a sudden the ship? - I know you have questions. - That would be why I just asked them. But there isn't a lot of time, Captain. I need you to trust me. - I'm not dreaming? - We all are. Don't make faces. [ River ] Are you ready? [ Early ] I just have to think here. These older models have locators at all? Won't help. You know, with the exception of one deadly and unpredictable midget... this girl is the smallest cargo I've ever had to transport... yet by far the most troublesome. - Does that seem right to you? - What'd he do? - Who? - The midget. Arson. The little man loved fire. I can take this guy out. [ River ] He's faster than you. All of you. - And he's wearing armor. - What about his face? - Is his face wearing armor? - No touching guns. It's soon now. Are you ready? - How do you know what this guy's gonna do? - I'm very close to him. - He doesn't even see it. - Okay, but-- Go now. [ River ] You're not welcome here anymore, Early. Do you think I'm gonna leave here empty-handed? I know it. Yeah, well, you know me real well. Wish I didn't. You like to hurt folk. It's part of the job. It's why you took the job. Power. Control. Pain. Your mother knew. Sadness in her when she waved good-bye. She's relieved. Saw darkness in you. You're not well. You'll be wanting to shut up now. Big golden retriever sitting on the lawn. Never took to you, smelling you. The neighbor's pet. You did things to him. Cleaned up after. Shined and polished. Everything in here gleams. Well, I'll be a son of a whore. You're not in my gorram mind. You're on my gorram ship! [ Laughing ] It's very interesting, all these buttons. Okay! We're not touching those, okay? - How the hell did she get on my ship? - Put the gun away. Okay. I'm putting it away. No, he's not. I'm putting it away because we're all reasonable people. Don't want to be doing anything rash... fiddling with any dials. You're not right, Early. You're not righteous. You've got issues. No. Or yes. I could have that. You might have me figured out then. Good job. I'm not a hundred percent. - You talk too much. - I'm flawed in that way. I sometimes go on. - It's been said-- - It's okay, Early. - I'm going with you. - River, what are you-- Don't belong. Dangerous like you. Can't be controlled. Can't be trusted. Everyone could just go on without me and not just have to worry. People could be what they wanted to be... could be with the people they wanted. Could live simple. No secrets. - No. - I'll be fine. I'll be your bounty, Jubal Early... and I'll just fade away. Well, finally something goes according to-- Simon? [ Screams ] See? That's what it feels like. Just hang tight, darlin'. Early's on the move. [ River ] Shh. It's okay. You made the right move, darlin'. Best for you to go on with ol' Early. You think so? Some of us feel differently. Permission to come aboard? You know, you ain't quite right. It's the popular theory. Go on, get in there. Give your brother a thrashing for messing up your plan. He takes so much looking after. To the left. Your left. Okay, now, very gently, pull that aside. This is really not my area of expertise, Doctor. I tend to be putting these into people more than the other thing. Can I mop your brow? I am at the ready with the fearsome brow mop. - You got the bullet. - [ Grunts ] Okay, I'm just gonna pass out for a minute, but you're doing great. And we live to fight another day. Any chance that-- [ Chinese ] might survive? Air he had left, I'd say his chance would be about one in... a very large number. Ain't odds I'd play. How's your lip? - [ Book ] I just feel such a fool. - [Jayne ] Yeah. All them years of priest training... and taken out by one bounty hunter. Don't get me wrong. I gave him a hell of a fight. - Epic, I'm guessing. - They're be poems and songs. -Just you wait. - At least you got some play. I missed every damn thing. [ Kaylee ] And then his folks come by to fetch him... and it turns out he's, like, 14 years old. [ Laughing ] I mean, he must've been some kind of genetic experiment... 'cause I swear this guy was, uh-- [ Sighs ] Oh, my daddy whupped me so hard. Oh. Well, I'm at fours. Let's see you match that. I can win this. I'm hearing a lot of talk there, genius. Come on. Show me what you got. Well, here I am. Grr! Arrgh!
