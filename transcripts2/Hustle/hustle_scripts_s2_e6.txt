 Hustle (2004â€“2012): Season 2, Episode 6 - Eye of the Beholder - full transcript 
 The team seemingly gives up the long con to fulfill one of Danny's lifelong dreams: to steal the crown jewels. Or at least one them, anyways. The Star of Africa is soon to go on display in a local museum and Danny sees this as their chance. He arranges through their fence Benny to obtain five sealed bids for the diamond and the crew set about determining just how they are going to break into a room with time-locked doors and laser sensors. Things become complicated when Benny is arrested by the police and spills the beans on the plan.

 -You can't nick the Crown Jewels. -Why not? Why not? I'll tell you why not. Because it's unpatriotic for a start. Besides which, I don't fancy being banged up... in the Tower of London for the next 300 years. -For once, I think Danny may have a point. -Yeah, thank you, Stacie. What do you mean ''for once''? If we get caught, they'll throw away the key, won't they? Exactly. I'm too pretty to go to prison. I'll never get any sleep. Call me old-fashioned, but I was hoping to avoid getting caught. We're talking about the crime of the century.

 There's a band of private collectors who are willing to pay... a small fortune to add the First Star of Africa to their collection. -Can we find them? -All in hand. The First Star of Africa. 530.2 carats. Also known as the Cullinan I... because it's the largest of the nine stones cut from the Cullinan diamond... discovered in South Africa in 1905. It's now set in the head of the Royal Scepter. It is priceless. Home is the Tower of London. There has only ever been one attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. And that was by Colonel Blood in 1671. -What happened to him? -He failed. Great, so what are we gonna do? Swim the moat or scale the battlements?

 No need. The Royal Scepter's being moved... giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Why is it being moved? Right now it's being cleaned by the Royal Jewelers... -and after that it'll be moved again. -Where? The Guildhall Art Gallery is holding a major African exhibition... to coincide with the Commonwealth summit. It starts the day after tomorrow... and the Star of Africa is to be the centerpiece. All right. Think of it. The biggest score of this century or the last. Something that will be remembered 100, even 200 years from now. Everything I know, everything I've learned has been waiting for this moment. Nothing this big will ever come our way again. The downside is, if we get caught... we all go to prison for a very long time. -You all right, Mick? You on your own? -Yeah, looks that way. Cheers. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking. Really? What did you expect? You asked them to put the rest of their lives on the line. Yes, I did. You rolled the dice, they came up snake eyes. It happens. Yep. Just tell me one thing. Why? Because no one has ever dared attempt anything this big for 300 years. -And that's it? -For me, yes. Look, this is the biggest game in town. If we're not here, we're not anywhere. I can see that. You see, Mickey... I had my doubts earlier... but you can count me in. Thanks, Danny. That's worth a lot. But this can't happen without Stacie and Ash. Glad to hear it. -Was he sulking, Albert? -I'm afraid so, yeah. -Diddums. -I was not sulking. Well, it worked, looks like you're getting your own way. No, now, wait a minute, come on. This thing is far too big for anyone to be here... for any other reason than they want to be. You can't bottle it now. Cor blimey, first he sulks, now he's trying to back out. I'm not backing out, but... if we do this, we do it with our eyes open. Hey, if we can't do it... who can? -Eddie. -On the tab. So, is this a change of direction for you boys? -You're thieves now? -Just trying to earn a living, Benny. Tell me about it, there are no honest crooks anymore. Everyone tries to screw you. Me, I've been screwed more times than a coachload of hookers. I see you still have a wonderful way with words, Benjamin. Don't talk to me about words, Mr. Stroller. Time was a handshake was enough. Now, everyone's 14, with spots and rings in their noses... all using fancy words to screw you. ''Five percent of this. Two pints of that.'' ''Ten pence in the pound and pay you next Wednesday.'' -Yeah, it's a different world. -That it is. Me? I've had enough. Next year, I sell up. Let someone else get screwed. So. The great Mickey Bricks and Albert Stroller. Call me a Chinaman but my guess is you don't have a bag full of car radios. -Not quite. -So what is it? The Crown Jewels? Please tell me you're not serious. What we're looking for are a few select private collectors to put in sealed bids. -An auction? -Winner takes all. How long have I got? We've found the cleaning company who has the contract for the gallery. They employ mostly Eastern European workers. -You mean cheap. -Precisely. And you start tonight. Those are the details. All right. -Hello? -It's me. -Benny, what have you got for me? -It wasn't easy. I have to say that personally, I think you're insane. But if you pull it off, I've got five bidders lined up. All topnotch. I knew you were the man for the job. Sealed bids will be delivered to your hotel. Okay, Benny, I'll be in touch. -Well? -We are on. Thank you. That's blinding. No. -No. Believe me, thank you very much. -Danny, what are you doing? -Premium phone line, 50 quid a minute. -What? I set up one of these lines. Every time somebody phones this number... I get 50 quid in me pocket. But how are you going to get people to phone the number? No, listen, this is where the genius comes in. 'Cause I don't have to, you see. All I got to do, yeah, is I borrow a phone and I call the number. Yeah, then they think I'm making a 10p call... but I'm getting 50 big ones in me pocket. -Danny. -Yeah, Mickey. You did stop me using the credit cards. -They were very bad copies. -But they did work. We got thrown out of a restaurant. Granted, everyone, but I had a few teething troubles. Danny, I would much rather you focused on the job in hand. I'm focused, gang, I'm focused. This is just a little sideline. Make a little bit of money to buy some tobacco when you get us all arrested. Eddie, can I borrow your phone, mate? Just got to phone me old mom. Hello, Mom? I'll be watching you. -I've just made a pot of tea. -Yes, thank you. I will just finish my work. You'll wear the varnish off, you polish it any more. But I want to do a good job. Yes, and you'll do a better job with a cup of tea inside you. I be five minute. Lily. -What is happening in there? -Some kind of special exhibition. All very hush-hush. -Practicing a few moves. -And the music? Get me in the mood. -It worked for Tom Cruise, didn't it? -Okay. I haven't got in the chamber yet, but from what I've seen... they've got motion detectors, lasers, CCTV... pressure pads and a steel door with a time lock. -Belt and braces security then. -So what's the bottom line? It would have been easier if they'd kept it in the Tower of London. It'll be okay, we've got Spiderman on board. Yeah. Let's all have a good laugh. Listen, I'll be the only one who's match fit, okay. Yeah, there's nothing we can do about the pressure pads. We'll have to work round them. The biggest problem, though, will be the doors. Once they're shut, there's no other way of opening them until the morning. -Can we get in any other way? -No. It's a sealed room. -No windows. That's why they chose it. -Can we tunnel in? No, that would set off the motion detectors. -And there's no way of bypassing them? -Yeah. If there is, I haven't found it. So what are you saying, Ash? We should just call the whole thing off? No. Just give me a bit more time. I'll see what I can do. In the meantime... I'm late for work. Yeah. I'm gonna have to call you back. Hello, Benny. This is an inventory of what was found in your warehouse. And this is a list of items reported stolen... in the Greater London area over the past seven days. -As you can see they're virtually identical. -I bought every item there in good faith. In which case you'll have receipts, invoices. Names and addresses of suppliers. -We had a fire. -Oh, yes. Of course you did. Crime report. A container-Ioad of computer equipment... was stolen from the docks three weeks ago. They found the container yesterday morning. Someone had tried to burn it. Kids these days. No discipline. The fire went out. We dusted for prints... and you'll never guess what we found. Perfect match. Bang to rights, Benny. -How long, Mr. Wells? -With your form, fifteen years. You take a guilty, you might get 12. Well? Wait. -What about a deal? -What kind of deal? The imminent robbery of the Crown Jewels. -You saw how magnificent-- -You said it seven times. -No. -Mr. Morgan. I'm sorry to bother you, only the manager wondered... whether you could bring your account up-to-date? -It is rather a lot. -Yeah, it is. -I didn't have that. -You did. -Did you have that? -I didn't, I don't like-- -Who had that? -Enough. It's not a problem. Hey. Put your hand in there, mate. Keep it in there, I'll get this. -Thank you. -All right, you're very welcome. Listen, love, while you put that through the old switcherooney... -can I use your phone? -Of course. Got to phone me old mom. Hello, Mom? You shouldn't be in here. But I have to do floors. Not in here, sweetheart. They're bringing other people in. I am sorry. I can see I'll have to keep an eye on you. Come on. Come and have a cuppa. You can try my Bourbons. -Mick. -Hey. -How's it going? -I've got blisters on me blisters. -No gain without pain. -Yeah, right. Thank you. Look, I think I've got it. There's a safety feature on the door. The time lock's got a panel on the inside, in case anyone gets locked in. So can we use that? If we can get someone inside before they close it. Hey, haven't you lot got any homes to go to? -Just a few more minutes, Eddie. -Yeah, come on. -I need my beauty sleep. -Yeah, I'll second that. -Do you want a drink? -Won't you be lucky? Eddie, I just want to say... that I really appreciate you hanging on while Ash and I work something through. -Yeah, I know, Mick, but it's really late-- -Look, I'll tell you what, okay. We'll just have one more drink... and I promise, we'll be out of your hair really soon. What do you say? Come on, we'll be gone by 1:00. No, but it's gone on.... I could have sworn it was later than that. -Go on, then, one more. -You're a star. Right, come on, tell me about this safety feature. Sir? -DS Hodges? -Yes, sir. Your DI tells me you were working on a case last year. Michael Stone? Look, we had Stone under surveillance. But he found out somehow. And drafted in another grifter to impersonate a police officer. And the case collapsed? Stone's man ran the investigation, sir. Must have been very embarrassing for you. It was embarrassing for the whole department, sir. -DCI Mullens lost his job because of it. -Did he, now? So.... Tell me about Stone. -Long con artist-- -No. I know what he does. Tell me about the man. Mickey Stone is unique. He doesn't think like we do. You can't second-guess him. He gives the impression that he's making it all up as he goes along. No. But everything is planned, precise. -Why me? -You drew the short straw. I demand a recount. So when you gonna push me-- He puts together complicated... and seemingly unrelated events, impossible to unravel. Waiter, I'll have one of those. But all leading to the big con. The higher the stakes, the more he likes it. Yes, it has been long. Just when you think you've got him... I've got a job for you. Are you sitting down? -...you haven't. -You sound like a bit of a fan. Hardly, sir, he made me look like an incompetent idiot. Then how would you like to get your own back? Oh, God! Sorry. I tell you now, I've definitely caught something. Okay, this thing isn't going to work unless we can get someone inside the gallery... and in the exhibition room when the doors are locked. Once they're locked for the night, the doors can only be opened from the inside. -Which is where you come in. -How? Ash. We can get round the pressure pads by going over the top. The main problem, though, aside from the time lock on the door... will be the lasers and the motion detectors. Like I said, there's no way we can bypass them... and they'll set the alarms off as soon as we set foot in the room. -Solution? -The only way round it as far as I can see... -is to cut the power. -Won't that set the alarms off? Yeah, but if we do it outside somewhere in the road... we'll knock out the whole street. -There'll be alarms going off everywhere. -Smart. During that time, we'll have 30 seconds to cover up the motion detectors... and get to the door panel to stop the lasers from coming back on. -Will that be enough time? -It'll have to be. Once the genny kicks in, the lasers and everything else will be back on. CCTV? I can re-route those at source during the blackout. -Good. -So, what do I have to do then? The motion detectors and the lasers have to be disabled from the inside... before we open the door. The exhibition has five main exhibitors. The biggest of which is Joyce Martin. So what is your area of expertise? I absolutely adore the Urhobo pieces from the Niger Delta. Particularly the Iphri carved figures. But, aside from the traditional... I've always had a deep affection for some of the more contemporary pieces... such as Bruce Onobrakpeya's epoxy resin etchings. Completely stunning. Who's been using my phone? -Mick, can I say something? -Yeah, of course. -I've got a really bad feeling about this. -How so? -I don't know, it just feels.... -Foolhardy? Yeah, that'll do for a start. Ash, this is the biggest thing we've ever done. -It was never gonna be easy. -Yeah, but there's so much can go wrong. I know, but it won't. It won't. Okay, say it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing you. I think you're a flaming genius. -But I have to say what I think. -And you think this is a bad idea. It's what me gut says. Hello, sweetheart. New face. How you doing? Thank you very much. Goodbye. Bids are in. And Albie called, everything is set his end. Joyce Martin? She's put me in charge of the items going on show at the exhibition. So are we good to go? Yeah. Tomorrow night. The diamond, it'll be delivered to the gallery... under armed guard tomorrow morning. We know that Mickey Bricks and his team... are going to steal it. This is the first time that we've got a head start. There is no way they can know we're onto them. -We must use that. -Okay, we know they're smart. So no surveillance. I won't risk them getting wind of this operation. Which means that we simply watch the gallery... and wait for them to make their move. -Does everyone understand that? -Yes, guv. This team has made us look like fools too many times. This time it's our turn. I've found a place to cut off the power, but there's a problem. -What? -I can't be in two places at once. At the same time the power is being cut off... someone has to be re-routing the feed to the CCTV cameras. Can't you show someone how to do that? No, it's best if I do it. Someone else can do the electricity. -Okay, show Danny. -Me? No. No, I have trouble wiring a plug. It's all right. I'll talk you through it. We can use walkie-talkies. -Okay, I'll do it. -Stacie, how you getting on at the gallery? I've found a piece that's perfect. -Albert? -Everything will be ready. Okay, the exhibition opens tomorrow. So let's get some sleep. We'll come in here. There'll be four guards in the control room. One will be doing his rounds. Yeah, there's no set time, so the chances are we'll have to get past him. That done... Ash will give the signal to Danny to cut the power... which will give us 30 seconds to re-route the CCTV... and for Stacie to do her thing. You must get to the door before the emergency power kicks in. -Okay. -Or you'll be trapped by the lasers. When you've done that, we should be on the other side. I'd better go. -Albert? -Second floor. And you must be on time. We will. Any questions? -No. -Then let's go. Thanks for listening, sweetheart. Radio silence until further notice. Cleaning team. On time. -You okay, Mick? -Yeah. Put that back in me bag. All right. Maybe they're not going to do it tonight. Now what do I do? -Okay. -All right. -Come on, baby. There we go. -All right. We're on, Mick. Now we'll tape it for a while and then feed the tape through on a loop. Okay. -Danny, come in. -Ready, over. Okay, that should be enough. Danny? Have you got the box in place? Hang on. Yeah, I got the box in place. When you put the clips on, nothing will happen. Then after 10 seconds, the power will cut out. Take the crocodile clips and clip them both on the-- Vinny, where are you, mate? I've got a pick up at 19 Chapel Road, West One. Hello, you're on my frequency. I think you'll find you're on mine actually, darling. Just get off the line, you dozy cow. Don't you use that tone with me or you won't get a cab. I don't want a bleeding cab. Just get off the line. -Who's that, Mary? -Some bloke messing about. -Danny? -Ash? It's always the red. It's always red, isn't it? Come on. Or is it blue? Is it blue? Blue or red? Red. What the.... Good boy. Come on, Stace. You got 30 seconds. 12 elephant, 13 elephant. 16 elephant. 20 elephant. Twenty. Twenty-one. 25, 26 elephant. 30. Shit. Good. Okay. CCTV returned. It's all back up again. -All secured. -Okay. Hello? Let's hope Stacie's done her stuff. -Right, let's go? -Yeah. Thank you. External power cut. It wasn't just the gallery, the whole sector was out. Security? The emergency power is on and alarms have re-armed. What do you want to do? Hold your positions. I want to know if they're in there. What's she doing? She should have opened the door by now. Something must have gone wrong. Come on, Stacie. What kept you? Watch the pressure pads. Everything beyond this point is a pressure pad. If we touch them, the alarms go off, all right? -You ready, Mick? -Let's go. Stace. Carry on. Down. Stop. Hello, news desk, please. Lift. Okay, down. Stop. -Okay, any time now would be good. -Yeah. One for the scrapbook. -That's the cleaner's van again. -Shit, they must have been in the first van. -Go. -Hit the alarms! Hit the alarms! I knew it. -Who the hell are you? -I'm with The Times. We just received a call about a break-in. -Get her out! -Yeah, okay, just one minute. -How many do you think were involved? -Please. Any ideas? Stay out. There's no way they got out through any of the exits. The roof. Hey. Shit. Quiet. Do you mind? Dress. They disappeared. -Roadblocks? -They could be anywhere now. Okay. -It doesn't matter. -What? Think about it. We know it was them. But they have no way of knowing that. -Which means? -They don't know we're looking for them. I will bet you one year's salary... -they turn up back at the hotel. -They wouldn't be that stupid. Why not? As far as they're concerned, they've got clean away. -I still think they'll be long gone. -We'll see. Guv? Yes. Black cab just about to pass you, five people inside. I think it's them. Hold your positions. Wait for my signal. That is what I call a great night. I don't know about the rest of you, the old man's gonna hit the sack. -Yeah, I think I'll join you. -Really? No. I don't mean I'm gonna join you. I'm gonna have me own bed. -I had no idea you cared. -I do care, I love you, Albert. -You said you loved me. Oh, my God! -Shut up. Listen, you lot do what you want, all right, 'cause I'm gonna get a drink. 'Cause I've had a very traumatic couple of days. Come on, then, I'll keep you company. Eye, eye. Stand still. Don't move. -What's going on? -You're all under arrest. For what? Suspicion of theft. I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. Take them away. This way, please, sir. ...it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned... something that you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. I'm a friend of the police commissioner. If you'd just call him. Bang to rights, Mickey, party's over. Wait in line. I want to speak to my brief. In good time, just stand there. All right, who's first? He's been arrested on suspicion of theft... at the Guildhall Gallery at 10:30 this evening. -Name? -Ashley Morgan. -Date of birth? -21/7/60. -Address? -The Lexington Hotel. Empty your pockets out, will you, please? You've forgotten something? -Get this developed. -Sir. Take your tie off. Number three. Not quite as comfortable as the Lexington, but you'll have to make do. All right, who's next? Police chiefs have just confirmed... that five suspects have been detained for the theft... of one of the world's best known diamonds, the First Star of Africa. The priceless diamond, which usually adorns the Royal Scepter... was recently moved from the Tower of London, to be placed... as the centerpiece in a special public exhibition at the Guildhall Gallery. Resuming interview with Michael Stone. 9:13 a.m. So, Mickey, you've had a bit of time to think. -Yeah. -Is there anything you'd like to tell us? -Nothing springs to mind. -Then I will ask you again. Can you tell me again where you were at 10:30 last night? -It's slipped my mind. -It's less than 12 hours ago. Yeah, I know, I've got a terrible memory. 10:30? I remember. No, it's gone again. I'm terribly sorry, but my.... What's the word? Memory. It isn't quite what it was, you see. What were you saying? Any chance of a fag? A robbery? How thrilling. Have you caught anyone yet? Thank you, sweetheart. Look, I really have no idea what you're talking about, Officer. Interview suspended, 9:18 a.m. -Where's the diamond, Mickey? -Is that allowed? Where's the bloody diamond? What? Can I have a word, guv? You might think you're clever, but I know you did this. And I'm going to put you away. -With or without the diamond. -Sir? I think you better see this. It's the film we took from Morgan's camera. Testing. One, two, three, four. Can you hear me at the back? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Police Courage Awards. Would you please make your way towards your seats. And the ceremonies will begin very shortly. Thank you. And now the last of tonight's civilian awards goes to a late entry. Someone who was brought to the Commissioner's attention... only a few days ago. Thank you. Waiter, I'll have one of those. A man who, without any thought for his own safety... saved the life of a fellow rambler. Michael Stone and the man who's life he saved, Daniel Blue. I was leaning down. There was an injured duck, you see. So there I was just trying to help... just help the little fellow, when suddenly, I lost me footing... and the next thing I knew, I was in the water. -Why me? -You drew the short straw. I demand a recount. So when you gonna push me-- I was drowning. Definitely drowning. -I can't swim. Help. -Hey. My whole life started flashing before me... I'd just left school... and I felt a strong hand pulling me up. There he is, there he is. It was Mr. Stone. He... saved my life. Thank you. Doesn't mean anything. We've got nothing to place them at the scene and no diamond. -They've hidden it. -It gets worse. We know the diamond was stolen half a mile from the ceremony at 10:30. The Commissioner's watch. It says 10:20. You've forgotten something. That's.... That's not possible. And then just at the end, they add the little sprinkles on top. And that's what makes it a mochaccino. -You're free to go. -I'm sorry? I said you're free to go. Okay. It's just come back to me, where I was-- Get him out of here. Nice to see you again. It's been fun. It's not over yet. You still have to move the diamond. And when you do, I'll be there. -Where have you been? -Hey. The nice custody sergeant, he let me use his phone. Come on, we haven't got long. CID. Are you sure? Okay, thank you. Sir. We've found the diamond. Yes. -Where is it? -It's still at the gallery. Doris, how did we do? Five copies as ordered. That's great, Lily, just one more, please. I don't understand. Why go to all this trouble... and not even take the diamond? The British government are naturally very embarrassed by this theft. So Ml6 has come up with a plan to invent a story to save face. They'll say the diamond has been found... and the perpetrators caught. They'll then put a replica into the Royal Scepter and replace it in the Tower. Yeah, we're expecting the cover-up story to hit the press... some time later today, just so you know. So then, all that leaves me to do is to ask you, can I use your phone? Thank you. Hello, Mom? Police? I'd like to report the whereabouts of some stolen goods. -You got your amnesty? -In writing. And Benny... -enjoy your retirement. -I certainly will. Oh, ye of little faith. You see, it's the perfect con. There's no crime, so there's nothing to be arrested for. And the only losers are five mugs greedy enough to buy five fake diamonds. And when they find out they've been conned... who are they gonna tell? There it is, back of the net. Right, this is a toast. A toast to Mickey Bricks... -who is without doubt, a bleeding genius. -Worthy of any of the greats. I still think he should have told us at the start. The risk was the same. If you got caught... who would have believed you weren't stealing the diamond, simply moving it? Will you take a look at that? Nice one, Lily. She deserved a bit of luck. Yeah, it's beautiful, Ash, nearly as beautiful as the fact... that I've now clocked up 93 minutes on my phone line... which comes to ?4,500. Right on. -Hey. -Hey. -Who paid the bill? -Danny. -With what? -Credit card. -Please tell me you didn't. -What? The police are downstairs... and the receptionist is showing them a credit card receipt. So, please, Danny, pretty please with knobs on... tell me you did not use one of yours. -We better pack. -Danny. We've just pulled off the biggest con of the century... and we're sneaking out of a hotel for paying the bill with a bent credit card. -Yeah, blame me, why don't you? -We do. I've had a very rough couple of days, you know. All for the good of the team. I've been pushed in that bloody canal. Nearly drowned. I been electrocuted, nearly fried. I've had a very harrowing time, I'll have you know. -Are you lot listening to me? -No. -Come on, Albie. -I'm coming, I'm coming. English
