 Hustle (2004â€“2012): Season 3, Episode 1 - Price for Fame - full transcript 
 Strapped for cash after a spell in Las Vegas, the gang of long con artists are back. When Albert's intended mark has a heart attack he spots a last minute replacement in nasty pub owner Benny Frasier ['Mel Smith'] who smuggles illegal refugees to work for him. The gang target him through his bratty son, who sees himself as a British hip-hop talent. Using the pop scene as a backdrop, have they managed to persuade him to part with his cash for his son's 'stardom' undetected? Will they get caught in the police investigation that follows him?

 And this stock, the one you told me about, is about to rise, you say? Once the merger between Asia Pacific and Dragon Asiatic is announced to the Tokyo stock market, it will go through the roof. Quite. - You got the gear, brother? - Here you go, mate. Safe. Fortunately, my contacts in the Far East are well-versed in buying this kind of stock without attracting attention. - What do you think? - Jamaican Switch? - That still work? - Let's find out.

 And these contacts, are you absolutely sure they can be trusted? Oh, yes. Hey, somebody stop him ! He's got my handbag. Yo, hold it. Hey. - You got this lady's bag? - No, it's my bag. Gimme that. It's all right, lady, we got it. This your bag? - Oh, thank you so much. - Wait! Oh, thank God. Oh, I think he must have followed me from the bank. You must be mad. What you doing around here with all that cash? I have to get it to my solicitor by 1:00. Well, it's 12:50 now. Where's he at? - Walthamstow. - Walthamstow? You'd best move it, girl.

 - Will you help me up then, please? - Yeah, yeah. - I've twisted my ankle. - All right, all right. Stay there, stay there. - Stay there. We'll take a look. - I have to get to Walthamstow. No, no, the only place you're going is the hospital. - I think it's broken. - Well, will you take it for me then? - You don't even know me. - You stopped him. I know you're honest. Please, if this money doesn't get there by 1:00, then we're gonna lose our house. No, no, no. I ain't taking no money nowhere. Will you take it then, for me? I can't tell you how pleased I am you invited me to be in on this, George. I've always thought that life is full of opportunities. But just as important is finding people willing to take them. - Okay, I'll take it. - Thank you. Here, I've got his address here. You have to ask for a Mr. Hawkins. - Hawkins. - Please tell me you're not letting this boy take your money. You keep your nose out, mate. I'm helping the lady. You're helping yourself, more like. - He's got an honest face. - Yeah, see? I got an honest face. - Now, don't play with me. - You've got to get there by 1:00. I'll be like the wind. - Yo, yo, wait, hold up, hold up. - I told you, man, I ain't no thief. Yeah, but you're stupid. You're gonna walk into Walthamstow with that in your hand? Come on, you got a handkerchief or something? - I got no handkerchief. - All right, all right. Well, look. Man, right, you take the handkerchief, right, and then you... Give me the money. Oh, come on. Right. You put this in. You got any more? What? Cash, man. You hide it or you lose it, dread. - Oh, Lord, have mercy. - I've been saving. Yeah, right. Okay, you put it in there, right? Then you wrap it up like this, tight, and then you put it down the front. - Yeah. - Keep it out of sight. No one sees it, no one takes it. Eh? All right. Now, please don't thief this woman's money. You get me? I'm cool. - Hurry up, please. - I'm already there. I wish Albert would hurry up and bring Hemmings in. I'm getting too old for this. Hey, Mick, did you have to throw that bin so hard? You got me right in the maracas. How did we do? So, I thought I should set up a meeting for tomorrow morning. Would you like me to bring the cash with me, George? That would be great, yes. Excellent. Here's to a profitable union. Are we solvent again? We are, for now. But this won't last us for long. Oh, Albert will come through. He always does. Yeah, yeah. Right out. - You got to get us a decent place, Ash. - I'm working on it. Can you work a bit quicker, please? Look, we've been through every major hotel in London. The couple we could have used, you naused up with dodgy credit cards. I'm not being funny, mate, okay? We need a new gaff, 'cause I can smell cats. Look, I told you. I'm working on it, all right? All right. How about I share a room with Stacie, then? Make things a bit more, you know, bearable. - For who? - All right. I know what this is all about. About the Vegas thing, innit? Yeah, yeah. They were identical cases, okay? - It could have happened to anybody. - Except, it happened to you. Yeah, every penny we had was in that case. Hey, it's been a pleasure doing business with you. Likewise. All you had to do was switch cases. How hard can it be? - All right. Hold a grudge, why don't you? - We will. I'll give Albert a call, see if we're on. Clive Hemmings? The man I came in with. Is there any news? He's fine. His family are with him now. Michael? No, no, no. Nothing. Nothing. - Just a little hiccup. - We need this one, Albert. I've never let you down yet. I'll call you as soon as we're ready to go. Don't tell me where to park, son. I can park where I like. So the Bentley's in an ambulance bay, what're you gonna do? Fine me? I could buy the flaming car park. I could buy this bleeding hospital. And you and your missus. So get out of my face, all right? - So, what are you? Old bill? - CIA. Why can some people manage to catch the barman's eye and I never can? Oi, Henry, Harris, or whatever your bloody name is. - Hannu. - Serve the man. - What can I get for you, sir? - Scotch on the rocks, lots of rocks. Well, you obviously have the knack for it. Well, it shouldn't be hard. I own the gaff. Hey, Elvis! What did I tell you about playing that crap? You wanna do your own songs, go on Pop Idol. It's supposed to be a sing-along night, you know, where you play songs people already know, so they can sing along to them? The clue's in the title. Dickhead. Can I buy you a drink? James Parkinson. Benny Frazier. Albie. We were just about to send out a search party. Are we on? Would you like the good news or the bad news? The bad news. Hemmings had a heart attack. He's in St Mary's hospital. - So the score's off? - I'm afraid so. And the good news? I found a last-minute replacement. Benjamin Frazier, a rather vulgar gentleman who owns 16 licensed clubs and pubs across the East End. - Benny the boozer. - You know him? Oh, I've never met him, but I know of him. Yeah, nasty piece of work. He bought the Iron Duke in Bow about 20 years ago, a right dive it was. Fights every night. Benny turned it round by beating the crap out of the troublemakers. - What a nice man. - Exactly. He's a major importer of booze. Nobody asks any questions because of all the bars he runs. What they don't know is that he uses his alcohol shipments as a cover for smuggling in Eastern Europeans. The police have been after him for a while, but they could never get anything on him. Rumor is he hands out backhanders like it was confetti. Also, he married above himself, some rich sort. Showers her with expensive presents, you know? You said 250, right? Come on, Benny, this is the genuine article. It's five grand's worth. - I'll give you 250. - No, man. - Come on, it's for the wife. - I don't care who it's for. All right, all right. You want to haggle with me. Call it 200 for cash, shall we? So, we use the wife then, yeah? Well, that's what I thought at first, then I discovered he has a greater weakness. - Which is? - He has a 17 year-old son, Joey, - who's a budding rap star. - Rap. - Well, is he any good? - Who knows? But Benny indulges him. Oh, wicked. So, what's our in? Well, I told him I had a friend who has a son who owns a small record company. - Do you mind? - It's not like you to be bashful. - You shouldn't go sneaking up on people. - Well, you didn't lock the door. Claustrophobic. What do you want? - Oh, sweet. - Yeah, I found him here. - Sing. - Eh? - Sing. - What for? Because I need you to. - Sing what? - Anything. Come on. It's not like you to be shy. Okay. So, where are we? Well, Benny read Danny's profile in the press. And he was more than a little impressed when I told him I was able to arrange for Danny to watch his son's performance tonight. Great. Stacie? We've had some interesting responses to Danny's demo tape. Strangely enough though, they were all, "Don't call us, we'll call you." Peasants. But now I've got letterheads from every major record company. I can pretty much give you what you want. Okay. Once we've hooked him, how about letters saying they've heard Joey Frazier's demo tape and they're interested in signing him? - As good as done. - Okay. Okay. Next, Albert, Danny, it's time you met Joey. What's up, boys? Policeman's ball cancelled? I've come here to see my boy perform. That's not against the law now, is it? Hey, hey. Bring these two some pork scratchings. Hey, Jimmy, how you doing? - Good to see you. - Yeah, and you. Good night, boys. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, they're just a couple of boys in blue. You know, they like to pop in every now and then, you know, see how I'm doing. Joey! Joey, come meet Jimmy. That's my boy. - This is the man who's arranged... - Yeah. Tight, man. ...for Terry Cunningham to come and see you. These fools is giving me grief, innit? Look here, I don't need no support band, but they're just messing with my space, guy. I is not happy. Oi, Henry, sack the other act. They have come a long way. Well, they should know their way back then, shouldn't they? Do I pay them? What for? They're not doing anything. Chuck them out. Hey. - All right, son. - Yeah, tight. He's a delightful boy, isn't he? Yeah, he's a chip off the old block, you know. Here she is, Head Office. Sharon, this is Jimmy Parkinson, the guy I was telling you about. - Mr. Parkinson. - My pleasure. - Her dad helped me buy my first boozer. - Really? So, you're in the music business, Mr. Parkinson? Oh, no, not really. I've just got a good friend who has a son who makes records. Yeah, Terry Cunningham, you know, the article I showed you. Yeah, he seemed like a very busy young man. I'm surprised he can spare the time. Ah, well, you see, it's not what you know, it's who you know, right? Absolutely. Well, it was very nice to meet you, Mr. Parkinson. I'll see you at home later. - All right. - You're not staying? My father's a little unwell, so duty calls, I'm afraid. - I see, yes. - See you, doll. Tell me, does your wife share your ambitions for Joey? Well, she says I spoil him. You know, I had nothing when I was a kid. So, I always promised meself when it came to my boy, I would do whatever it took. It don't go there. What is you, a moron or something? Ah, Benny. This is Terry Cunningham. - How do you do? - Good to meet you. Listen up. - So, this is the kid, is it? - This is my boy, yeah. You see, I go with the flow but I ain't passive Hanging on in with the West London massive Don't bring me down with your institution What you got ain't knowledge It is mental pollution Stay away from me and me bitches You going to the doctor and counting the stitches Crack me up, I say crack me up Gonna whack me up Gonna whack me up Crack me up, I say crack me up I'm gonna whack you up Gonna whack me up Very interesting sound. Just a lot of noise to me, Terry, but you know, it's what the kids listen to these days, right? That they do, Benny. Crack me up, I say crack me up Gonna whack me up Gonna whack me up Keep it real, man. Is he the dogs, or what? - He's got a unique style. I like that. - Yeah. You hear that, Jimmy? My little ankle biter's bleeding unique. Get the drinks in, old son. Right. - So, who's he with then? - With? Yeah, has he signed to a record company? Well, not yet. No, no, no. He's still thinking through his options. Okay, he has a manager though, right? Not yet, no, no. He's... You know, he's choosing who to sign to very carefully, you know. That's very wise, Benny, very wise. I can see he's a very lucky young man to have someone like you looking out for him. Why are you talking to me like I'm a tosser? - Do I look like a tosser to you? - No. Well, then cut all this "lucky young man to have you as a dad" crap, and tell me what you think of the boy. I think he's got potential. "Potential"? What is that? My arse has got potential. You gonna get him a record deal or not? If I can find the right producer, then yeah. Yeah. That wasn't too hard, was it? Come on. Here, Joey, say hello to Mr. Cunningham. Joey. All right, so, Joey, who are your influences then? I ain't influenced by no one. I is totally original. Good answer. That's a very good answer. Yeah, and this man runs a record company. - I ain't signing for no fool in a suit. - What? Ain't no one in the ghetto wear no suit. I can't even be seen with you, man. Stay out of my face. My homies be thinking I is a batty boy or something. Yo, watch my stuff, innit? I think that looks like a thumbs down, Terry. Sorry, son. Just leave it! - Pick it up, Danny. - Pick it up? The kid is a flaming moron. "Ain't no one in the ghetto wear no suit." He's from bloody Essex. You need to connect with him. Yeah? Well, how about I connect with a right hook? My gran could rap better than him. - Daniel, we're working. - Yeah, yeah. Just give me a minute. I mean, how am I supposed to work with people like this, eh? I'm an artist. Pack up my speakers or something. - Artistic temperament, you see? - Yeah. So, Benny, I want to thank you for your time. It is a pity things didn't work out. Only I was hoping to take the kid to the Mobo Awards, you know. - Introduce him to a few people. - You can get me in the Mobos? Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem. You'll have VIP passes. Meet and greet the great and the good. It could have been a big step for you. Still, never mind, eh? Good to see you, kid, good luck. Benny, thank you. Hey, now wait. Hey, chill, yeah. Look, I ain't saying no. I just say we have to keep it real, keep it street. Don't hang around with me dressed as no bank manager. Yeah, you get me? I'll come to the Mobo and meet your people. After that, I ain't saying nothing. - I had three dodgy tenners last week. - Yeah, well. Not from me, you didn't. - Danny. - Danny. - So, you lot still looking for new diggs? - Why? Do you know anywhere? This mate of mine, he's gone to Dubai for 12 months. He's asked me to rent his flat out for him. It's not much, you know, two bedrooms, little kitchenette bit. Only it would have to be cash. And up-front. Thanks, Eddie, but I think we're looking for somewhere a little bit more upmarket than your mate's flat. Suit yourself. - Hey, how did it go? - Yeah, perfect. He hated me, just like you said he would. Good, then he'll be ready to meet the real deal. Ash, we'll need a profile. All right. Do you want Stacie as an assistant? - Bitch. - I beg your pardon? Oh, sorry, rap producers don't have assistants, they have bitches. When and where did you set up the meet? - We had a bit of a problem with that. - Yes? I went in. Very simple, like you said. He, kind of, went into one a little bit. I had to give him a little bit of a convincer. Which was? I told him we'll take him to the Mobo Awards tomorrow night. All right, son. How's it going? Oh, hang on. Yeah, yeah, I'm at the front doors, and I'm with... - Kevin. - Kevin. No, he's doing a great job. Yeah, the doors are clear, and the paps are all taped off and under control. Yeah, sweet as water. Yeah, well, I'll fill Kevin in. You make sure there's an extra area cordoned off in the VIP. Yeah? Okay, yeah. Yeah, gotcha. Bleeding management. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Now, Kev, we've just had word that J-Lo is en route from the airport. She's sent her people on first to check on the flowers, the glasses, the chairs and the carpet. So, you'd better stick these names on your list and give them VIP passes. But no one else gets in unless they're on one of these lists, - and I mean no one. Any questions? - Yeah. Good man. Stay behind the tape, please, gentlemen. Thank you, let's keep it clean. Yeah, all set. You're in the VIP lounge, but you're on your own from there. Oh, and the doorman's Kevin. All right, guys. All right, all right, darling. Don't rush. Don't rush. All right, all right, lovely. Here he is, Joey Frazier. All right, we're going. Joey Frazier. All right. All right, Kevin. Terry Cunningham, Grifter Records. We've got Benny, Sharon and Joey Frazier. - The J-Lo party, right? - Yeah, that's right, mate. She's just getting changed. Murder. "Does my bum look big in this? Does my bum look big in that?" Damien Moss and Missy DuPres. This producer guy, how long you known him? Damien? We go back a long way. - And what does he do exactly? - Okay, I'm the manager, all right? I put the deals together, he is the producer, all right? He makes the music, all right? This guy has worked with everybody. Missy Elliott, Beyonce, Jay Z. - What? For real? - Oh, yeah, man, for real. Hey, look. It's Linford Christie. Look, see that, boy? Which crew is he with? No, he's not with a band. He's an athlete, ain't he? He ran the 100 meters in under 10 seconds. He won everything in his day, everything, brilliant. Here he is now. Look at him, the legend. Come here, man. Yo, Terry. - Damo, thanks for coming. - What it is, man? Too long, man. - Missy, how's my favorite girl? - Yo, Terry. Here he is. The guy I was telling you about. Joey Frazier. - Hey, what it is, yo? - You all right. - This is Damien. - Yo. That's it and this is Missy here. - Respect. - Respect all around. Okay. Joey's parents, we've got Benny, we've got Sharon over here. Thank you. - Okay, guys. A bit of Cristal. - Yeah, T. Beautiful. Excuse me. Terry Cunningham, Grifter Records. I don't want to bother you. I just want to say to you, I love you, man. Thank you. I love your stuff. I watched all your races. Beautiful thing. Hello, sweetheart. Bottle of Cristal, please. Five glasses. All that Olympics, I mean all that running. Listen, I'll stop beating around the bush, all right? You see, the thing is I'm with this new bird. - Very nice. Very nice. - Yeah, all right. She's nice. And she's a big athletics fan. And, well, if she thought that I knew you, I would definitely be in there, you know what I mean? Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. Listen, on your way past, just give me a little wave. Say goodbye, that sort of thing. That could mean the difference between me getting laid or not. Yeah? Look at this. Laid. Not laid. Laid. Not laid. Laid. - Not laid. - Yeah, got it. You got it. Okay, beautiful, I'll leave it up to you. Anyway, just remember, before you were famous, good-looking, fit and tough and everything, how hard it was to get laid. I mean you've done all right since. She's lovely. But you know, for us little guys, it's murder out there. You're a top man and I tell you what, kid, you're quick. But not as quick as me. I'm only kidding. See you later. Have a nice time. Hey. Here we go. Drinky poos. So, Joey, Joey, Joey. Terry tells me you've got some kind of flow, dawg. I just keeping it real, you know. Yeah, man. I hear you, I hear you. A lot of players out there don't know what that shit means, though. You check their flows and they be trying to front on all that East versus West shit, man, play it out, but you can just check Pac and Biggie for that. No, man. We got to remember where and why hip-hop started in the first place. And whatever you do, whatever you spit, Joey, you got to be true to that. You feel me? Wow, enough respect for that, bro. Terry, my man, what's up? - Not now, mate, I'm talking to people. - But you said to... Yeah, I know what I said, but now's not the time or the place, all right? - You know what? Screw yourself. - Yeah, go on, screw yourself, too. Everyone knows you used to stick a sock down it. Sorry, ladies, sorry. Okay. Let's talk business. First, we get Joey into a studio, we lay down a track. If that goes well, we kick into phase two. These days, it don't matter how good the music is, you got to get the right image. - You get that right, you're home free. - Image? Missy, do your thing, girl. Okay. I see bad boy, baby. Virginity theft, sneaking into girls' bedrooms at night, slapping them around and leaving them a rose on their pillow. I see fast cars and guns, mindless violence and group sex. Kids like hiding his records in their bedrooms, 'cause they don't want to be grounded for life. Let's take that generation gap, and all that institutional crap, open it up, and rip out your grandma's heart. You feel me? - I see a British Eminem. - Oh, yeah, man. Cool. Yeah. Yeah, look, sweetheart, before we go any further, how much is this gonna cost me? Nothing. Not a penny. That's what I do. What's in it for you, then? Okay. Here's the deal, if Damien likes what he hears, I'm gonna take Joey on. I'm gonna spend, say, 100 thou developing his profile. I'm gonna use some of Uncle James' city contacts to raise the capital. Then when the time's right, I'm going to license him to one of the five major labels for five times that. So you make ?400,000? Hey, it's a dirty job, somebody's got to do it. And what about Joey? He makes his money from advances against record sales, and everybody is a winner. Can I ask you something, Mr. Moss? Why are you interested in helping my son? I'm not. Look, no disrespect to my little homie over here, all right? But look, despite his fashion sense, Terry's my man, all right? Now if he says I gots to come all the way over here and listen to your boy, then that's what I'm gonna do. Now we'll cut a track, and if, if Joey can flow like T says he can, then maybe we can do business, maybe not. You hear my boy out, that's good enough for me, all right? There must be one hotel we can get into. Yeah, all right, Mick. Well, anything changes, - let us know, yeah? All right, yeah, ta-ta. - Still no luck? The manager at The Lexington sent our CCTV picture to every other major hotel after we did a runner last year. Why don't you just pay your hotel bill like normal people? I can't believe I asked that. Look, my mate's place is still up for grabs, you know? Yeah, well, it might come to that. - How did it go? - So far, so good. - But we need a recording studio. - Yeah? For when? - Oh, don't worry, I've got loads of time. - Yeah, no rush. - Not for a man of your caliber. - Absolutely. So, tomorrow night be okay? Eddie, could we have some drinks in the office? No, I need a recording studio. Do you know anywhere? Yeah. Great. Good man. Stace, I've got a job for you. Can you turn that down, please? How did you get in? - And you are? - I work here. Well, let's hope that's still the case when I've completed my investigation. Shall we? Where's the owner? He's at home. Who are you? Coleen Cooper, Noise Abatement. Name and address? - Please don't do this. - What? The whole hassle thing. I was just laying down some of my own stuff. That's all. It's after work. So, you're not supposed to be here? Are you familiar with Section 80 and 81 of the Environmental Protection Act of 1990, as amended by the noise and Statutory Nuisance Act of 1993? I wouldn't exactly say "familiar," no. I assume the owner wouldn't take too kindly to coming in tomorrow to discover he's been closed down. Okay, look, what do you want me to do? I'll do anything, anything you want. Is this yours? Look, please, seriously, I'll lose my job. - Do you have a canteen? - It's out the back, yeah. Then, I suggest you go there, sit down, drink coffee, sober up. Do not move until I tell you to do so. You're not going to report me, are you? I'll run some tests, if I can squeeze things into a 10% discriminatory factor, I'll let you off with a written warning. - You can do that? - We're not monsters. Right. Coffee. Yeah, I'll... Thank you. Thank you. Danny? We're on. - Yo, T, are we ready? - Yeah, it's all set up, D. - Just the way you asked for. - Cool, cool. Yo, yo, what up? I'm liking that ice, girl. Why do we have to do this at night? It's Damien. He's nocturnal. It's a very street thing. Listen, kids, get yourself on the leather. Chill out. What kind of bass you got up in this mother? I want it loud and fat, so you can feel it. It's all there, D. It's all for you, brother. - Yo J. J, what it is, yo? - Yo. My sound's all right, man. All right, man. Let's do this, all right? Yo, J, we're set man. Let's go. One last time, J. Come on. I is walking through my own dissemination Education Bringing my words to the whole nation Illumination of my generation Standing at the station Self determination Bringing my words to the whole nation Illumination of my generation Standing at the station Self determination Joey, that is great. That's beautiful, brother. All right, people, that's a cut. So, what did you think? That shit is off the hazook, baby. You feel me? Yeah. Is that... Is that good? That's good. It means he likes him. So, Damo, where do we go from there? I think we stick it on some whites, get him into the clubs, - and see if we can get the word out. - That's a good idea but... Yeah, dawg, I think we got something here. - Yeah, all right. - Dawg. So, everything's all right? It would appear so, although I may need to come back to do a follow-up test. Cool. Yeah, whatever. Actually, I was thinking while I was having that coffee... Well, seven cups of coffee actually. No, what it is, I was thinking, now that I'm legal, as it were, whether you and I might be able to, I don't know, go out for a drink sometime, if that's allowed? I'm ever so sorry, I'm gay. Right, yeah. What a waste. - I doubt my partner would agree. - No. Actually, I don't suppose you and her... No. Please. Don't say it. - Yeah, yeah. - Put your feet right here. - Hey, yeah. - Feel comfortable? Okay, so I made a few calls, all the finance is in place. Okay, I reckon the promotional campaign for the first single is gonna be around 80 thou, yeah? For another 20 thou on that, we're going to have DJs, radio pluggers, stylists. Say what you got to say. So, it's really happening then? Yeah, it's happening. It is happening. We want it out quick. We want it out in the charts, be there for the Brit nominations. You do this for my boy Terry, I'll never forget it. Well, you must be able to find us somewhere to live. I mean, they can't all have been warned off. He's on the hook, but what happens now is important. He's not the kind of mark we want to come looking for us. - Any luck? - No, nothing. Ash, can we burn CDs from the master we made last night? Yeah, I'm already on it. I reckon 100 should do it. Okay. We print promotional material and put them up near every one of Benny's pubs where he can see them. What will really swing it would be to get radio play. I know just the woman. I'm off to the loo. Two minutes. You're listening to Sara Cox, this is Radio 1. Next up, some new music for you. This is by joeZ, and it's called Wack Me Up. They're playing my song. Once we release the single, we take the CDs that Ash is preparing, and we put them in all the displays of all the record shops we can find near Benny's pubs. We give it a week, tell him the single bombed and we've all lost money. And we are out of there. He won't even know he's been conned. Right. Questions? Yeah, how do you think of all this stuff? I suppose the only question now is when do we take him? Okay. He had a container delivered yesterday. He offloaded the human cargo, and it's parked up at his warehouse. I spoke to one of the guys there, he said three containers of alcohol are being sold on. They're being picked up today. The only problem we may have, it looks like the police have Benny under surveillance. Well, that shouldn't affect us. We don't go anywhere near the containers. Now, we have to catch him before he goes to the bank. I'm sorry for this imposition on your home, but Terry and his friend need to speak to Benny urgently. I see. No, no, we can't. The last shipment's been and gone, hasn't it? Well, tell them we'll bring over two dozen in the next trip. - Benny. - Yeah, hang on. And call me when you get to them, all right? - Jimmy. - I'm sorry to bust in on you like this. That's all right, my son. Come on in. - Benny. - Terry. - Good to see you. - Damien. I'll leave you men to it. I'll just go and check on Daddy. Joey, Damien and Terry are here. Benny, I had to come straight away and show you these. What are they? I sent Joey's tape to some of the major record labels. - Yo, J, what it is, yo? - Yo. Now, they're all saying if the single charts, they're interested in signing Joey up. Blimey, are these for real? For real, I'm telling you, son, my phone has been off the hook - all morning. Ringing non-stop. - Well, this is very exciting, innit? Yes, it's good, it's very good, but we've got a problem. What problem? Most of the money Uncle James raised was from venture capitalists in the city. Now, I've used them before, you know, financing new acts. I hit big, they hit big. - And? - They pulled out. The money I was expecting today ain't coming in. I've had to freeze everything. I've had to freeze the printers, cutting the promo discs for the clubs, the press. I'm sorry, Benny, I'm really sorry. I mean, what is annoying here is that we've got a single that is ready to go. But without the right promotion, it's dead in the water. Yeah, but there must be other backers, no? No. I've been on the phone all morning, it's too short a notice. Everything was geared to the money being here today. I've thought long and hard. The only thing we can do is put back the release date, but that does mean we're going to miss the Brit nominations. I mean, I could help find new investors, but it'd take weeks. So, hang on a minute, Jimmy, hang on, hang on. How much are we talking about here? We need to raise 100K. That's what we lost in the city. And since we ain't gonna get that, I say we go next year. - We take a little stab at it then. - Next year, dude? No way. I'm sorry. Dad, yeah? Do something, this is my big chance. They played me on the radio, man. Wait, wait. I'm thinking. I'm thinking. - Dad! - All right. All right. Okay, whoever puts this money up, how much of the 400K that you make are they gonna get? - Half. - Two hundred grand? Okay. Why don't I do it? You? Yeah, why not? Look, I've seen all the posters and everything you've done, you know. - That was all your money, right? - Yeah. Well, look, if you're willing to invest in my boy, I wouldn't be a very good dad if I didn't do the same, now would I? Wicked, D, you're the man. - No, listen. It won't work. - Why not? Because the problem we have is time. Like I said, to stay on track, we need the money now. We need the money today. So? Well, you can do that? Of course I can, I'm in the cash business, son. Yeah, my boy gets what he wants. I make double bubble in the process. Like you say, everyone's a winner. Right? Yeah, yeah, all right. Come back here, 1:00. I'll have the money ready. Would you like some more tea, Daddy? Would you like me to bring the cash with me, George? That would be great, yes. Excellent. Here's to a profitable union. Clive Hemmings? The man I came in with. Is there any news? He's fine. His family are with him now. I'm gonna get back and do those accounts, okay? Do you never think about anything but work? They said he'd be fine. See you later. Excuse me, sir. Is that your car parked in the ambulance bay? You'll need to move it. Don't tell me where to park, son. I can park where I like. So the Bentley's in an ambulance bay, what're you gonna do? Fine me? I could buy the bleeding car park and this hospital. And you and your missus and your kids. So get out of my face, all right? Oh, I think I might stretch for that sandwich now, after all. I say, what on earth is George doing here? - George? - George Palmer. There, my dear, with Benjamin. But that's James. That's James Parkinson. I had a mild heart attack, my darling, not a lobotomy. I was having lunch with him when it happened. It was George who called the ambulance. - Where are they? - What, the boys? They just left. What's going on? - Did you give them any money? - What? Did you give them any money? No, no, they're coming back this afternoon. - All right, guys. - Hi, Mick. Champagne, Eddie, and have half a lager yourself. - You're all heart, you are, Mick. - Well? It went like a dream. Danny excelled himself. Thank you, fans. Autographs later. We do the pick up at 1:00. He's had a good hour, Danny. Give him a call, see if we're still on track. I want everyone out there, okay? I want you to find these jokers. Someone must know where they are. Look, you can't do this. We've got police crawling all over us as it is. They were gonna rip me off! Okay, but just don't go charging around like a bull in a china shop. Do it quietly. Hello? Terry. No, no, no, everything's fine. Yeah, yeah, we're all really excited. Yes, the money's here. In fact, Benny suggested why don't you all come over and we open a bottle of champagne to celebrate? All of you, yes. A toast to the future. Marvelous. I really look forward to seeing you later. Come here. Bloody genius. - We okay? - Yeah. It's his missus. She wants us to go over, crack open a bottle and celebrate. More champagne. I love this job. Is there a problem? I don't know. You know, all the way through this, she's been as cool as a cucumber with me. Suddenly, she's gushing on me. There's ?100,000 just sitting there waiting for us. - Trust your instincts, Daniel. - You think they're onto us? I don't know, Mick, something in her voice. Okay. No, no, there are no holes, nothing left to chance. There is no way they can be onto us. We go. Hi, right on time. Lovely to see you all. Please come in. Here he is, here he is. - Benny, how you doing, son? - All right, son. Was that street enough for you, gangster man? Leave him alone! Come on, now, boy. Con men are supposed to have the gift of the gab, aren't they? You must have something to say. - I played the game and I lost. - Yeah, you did, yeah, yeah. Now you're gonna have to pay the price. And that, by the way, is 100,000 in cash, just to show you I'm not a Billy bullshitter. See? I mean what I say, and if I shake somebody's hand, that's it. Job's done. Not like you. Yes, sir? Yeah, I never thought I'd have to do this, but I need some help. You is dead, man. We is gonna take you out. Stand them up. I told you they were onto us. Look, you've made your point, now leave them alone. Oh, believe me, darling, this is nothing to what they've got coming. Using my boy to get to me. I'm gonna cut your livers out. Put them in the van. Hold on. - Benjamin Frazier? - Who wants to know? DI Garrett. We've had a report of violence. - Have you? - Luckily, we were right outside. Shit. Sit. What have we here then, Benny boy? Very nice. Looks like my Christmas has come early. - Brought in a dozen this time, didn't you? - I have no idea what you're talking about. You've been under surveillance for three months. Have I really? We followed a container from mainland Europe back to the UK. It was supposedly carrying booze, but 12 refugees were also hidden inside. Whoever sold it is about to go to prison for a very long time. Ah, well, I never sold anything, see? Fortunately, I don't have to take your word for that, being the lying toe-rag you are, because we arranged for the bills to be marked, so we could trace them back to source. Nick? Oh, dear. Officer, we're nothing to do with this. I'll be the judge of that when I've read all the statements. No, I'm just telling you... If I were you, I'd keep my gob shut. If it wasn't for your mate, you might be in even more trouble than you are now. Right, I want everyone banged up. Take your hands off me, you pig. I can't believe Ash called the old bill. I was on leave today till I got this call, and the missus is not happy, I can tell you. It's our anniversary, you see. "Make it up to me," she says. "Holiday abroad," she says, like I'm made of money. Here, Taffy. How would you like to give your old lady the best anniversary present she's ever had? I told him to do whatever it took. Yeah, but this. - How you doing, Eddie? - I think I've wet meself. So you have a little accident, nothing big, the back doors spring open. Not your fault, is it? I'm holding 50 grand in me hand here. - 50 grand, you say? - Yeah. No, no there are no holes, nothing left to chance. There is no way they can be onto us. We go. But I want a backup plan. Yes, sir. Yeah, I never thought I'd have to do this, but I need some help. What's the problem? D division sent a car over for repairs, and I've lost it. Lost it? Yeah, I think it's come over here by mistake, but the sergeant over at Acquisitions is going ballistic. Turns out he hasn't even signed it out yet. The servicing's not done here, now. It's farmed out. Where? All right, lads, is number 16 ready? - Who are you? - Acquisitions. The super wants it road tested before it goes back out. It's only in for an oil change. Yeah, but the last crew who took it out said it was over-steering. Now, I told him they were plonkers, but he said we should check it out before we buy any more. All right, well, take it. Keys are in it. Chris. Are the lads ready? Yeah, meet me at the corner of Western Road and Tavistock street. Yeah, it's hardly the time or the place, is it? All right, flat rate of 150, 250 with uniform. Oh, and drop by Eddie's, bring his ultraviolet machine. In fact, bring Eddie, make up the numbers. Yeah, I'll call you and give you a game plan. Yeah, all right. Yeah, good man, ta-ta. Hey. Hello, control, can you read me? Hello, control? Control here, go ahead. Yeah, can you tell CID that Benny Frazier's been involved in a fight at the Queen's Head in Moor Street? Over. Oh, dear. Officer, we're nothing to do with this. Yeah, well, it's always good to have a plan B, innit? And a little bonus. - Well done, well done. - Nice one, lads. Yeah, thank you, guys. I owe you one. Sorry about the short notice. - Any time, Mickey, you know that. - Thank you very much. Oh, oh, yes. Stacie will pay you before you go. - You're worth every penny. - Yeah, Danny, just a thought. Are you sure we got the right case? Get stuffed, Ash. I notice that nobody's actually thanked me yet. - For what? - Well, it was my grifting instincts that saved the day. I mean, I know you had your little plan B, but you know, enough respect to your homie. Aye? - Oh, yeah. - Eddie, get the drinks in. Hey, I'm officially a grifter now, so get them yourself. - I'll get them. - And put some music on. Put something on. Aye! No! It hasn't got a bath, but the shower works. It's got a curtain and everything. The furniture's a bit tatty, but you could throw something over it. Ash. Yeah. Well, you lot told me to find somewhere. - Who does it belong to? - Derek. It's this mate of mine, he's gone to Dubai for a year. Yeah, it's his living quarters. His boss lived upstairs. Here, we couldn't have a look at his place, could we? - Oh, no, I don't know, it's... - Oh, come on, it won't take a minute. Oh, God. Yeah, all right then, but don't touch anything. Yeah, you see, when his boss went back to Dubai for a year, he took Derek with him. - Wow. - Yeah, it's nice, innit? - So who's looking after it now? - Well, no one really. It's shut up. Derek asked me to pop in once a week. You know, just to make sure that everything was all right. What? I think we should go. I feel like we're intruding. Absolutely. I mean Derek's place, where you're going to be staying, is nothing like this, but there you go, beggars can't be choosers now, can they? Bye, Eddie. What you doing? Stop messing about. - We can put the rent on the tab. - Good thinking. Hello, can someone tell me what's going on? Hello! Well, now what are we gonna do? I'll make a few calls. We'll be in M?laga in three hours. - And what about my jewelry? - I'll buy you some more bloody jewelry. And keep up, you. This is all your bloody fault in the first place. The pigs came down Stormed in my drum Arrested me with my dad and my mum Shut up!
