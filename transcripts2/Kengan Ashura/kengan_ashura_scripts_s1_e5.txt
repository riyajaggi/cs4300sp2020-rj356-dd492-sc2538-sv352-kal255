 HIDEKI NOGI CHAIRMAN, NOGI GROUP SEN HATSUMI FIGHTER Thank you for waiting. It's time for boarding. THE GUARDS, PRIVATE ARMY OF METSUDO KATAHARA, GOVERNOR OF DAINIPPON BANK Those with invitations are welcome... THE KENGAN, CRUISE SHIP ...to board the Kengan cruise ship. Look at how gorgeous it is! It's one of the biggest luxury cruise ships in the world. GEN SHIKANO, JUN SEKIBAYASHI A ship? Never tried one. SHION SORYUIN, SETSUNA KIRYU But, um... Excuse me, but we don't have a letter of invitation. If you don't have an invitation, please board the other ship. Seriously? THE DEATH CARGO SHIP -That worn-out ship is for us? -What are they thinking? THE DEATH I will definitely get seasick on it. "BRAWL" Jeez! All I can say is "jeez." I feel nervous, being in a place like this. What's going to happen next? I'm feeling rather relaxed here. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting. We ask that the fighters go through that door into the other room. Would the rest of you please proceed upstairs? Does that mean we're going to be separated from Ohma? It seems so. See you, Kazuo Yamashita. -Wait! You're leaving us so soon? -Let's go upstairs. Well, well... I can see some fools in here mistakenly believe themselves to be the strongest. Wow, what a surprise! Look at that! Please, stop acting like a child, Mr. Yamashita. Oh, there's Ohma! He's seen us! What? Something to drink? Okay, okay. I have his bag here. If it's just a drink, I'll take it to him. -Don't forget, you're a president for now. -"For now"? -Please, try to be dignified. -Yes. Why are they keeping the employers and the fighters in different rooms? -Thanks. -Is there anything else? Well, see you later. Wait, Kaede. What do you think about this situation? What do you mean? I mean exactly what I said. Something is obviously off... It's like some kind of special show. I can't wait to see what's going to happen. Wait, don't tell me... -The Death has departed. -All right, start it. What just happened? Employers and fighters, thank you for waiting. Our ship has set sail, as planned. I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce that the preliminary match of the Life-or-Death Tournament has begun. The preliminary match? -Do we have to do this? -I didn't know that. One hundred and fifty-one participants have been entered into this tournament. Twenty eight out of the 151 participants have an invitation from Chairman Katahara, and are seeded to fight in the finals. Those are the guys who boarded the other ship. Only five more participants can make it to the finals. We would like to challenge everyone here to a battle royal. You have until dawn. Excuse me, I'm not supposed to be in here! I'm not a fighter! From now on, you are prohibited from contacting your fighter for any reason. Please enjoy watching the battle royal from the viewing area above the field. I can't believe this! Ms. Akiyama is in danger! You can also enjoy a game on the deck courtesy of our bookmaker. Any of you who are confident about the outcome are welcome to place a bet. I guess we'll be trapped in this room until the preliminary match is over. That includes you. You have no choice. Be careful not to get in my way. Are you an idiot? -What the... -Besides, it's your fault that I'm trapped in here! Ohma, of course you are responsible! You must win this, okay? Protect me at all costs until you win this battle. Well, you've got some guts. Hey, you brought a woman with you? That's some nerve! The match is already on! -Kaede Akiyama. -Address me in a more polite manner. -Keep well back. -Don't use my full name. -Laid-back, aren't you? -I'll kill you! NIKO STYLE - REDIRECTION KATA: WEEPING WILLOW What's happening? The flow of power is bent. Yes! All right. -Keep behind me, Your Majesty. -Sure. Did you see that? He's pretty strong. Let's smash him first. It'll be harder for each of us if he survives this round. Let's crush him as a group. Tokita! -Lihito. -He entered the tournament too? LIHITO FIGHTER, SH FROZEN STORAGE -I've missed you, Tokita. -That's Lihito. -Lihito the Ripper! -Hey, Lihito. Don't say you've forgotten me. I'm going to get back at you for this scar. Who are you, jerk? Go away. THE RAZOR'S EDGE, TEN RIPPING FINGERS He ripped close up. He's become more skillful. I've longed to see you, Tokita. I've trained relentlessly for this moment... -You're Nogi Group's... -Hi. What are you doing here? Um... I'm Kaede Akiyama. I didn't choose to be here. I brought water to Ohma, and now here I am, having to endure all this. Are you listening? -Do you have a boyfriend? -I knew you weren't listening. Okay, I think I understand your situation, Tokita. Look, they're targeting you too. Don't worry, baby. I'll be your bodyguard! No, thank you. She doesn't need you. Can I get started? -Don't hold back for my sake. -You wanted to beat me up, didn't you? Right. I'll get my revenge on you, don't worry. But not now. I want you to advance to the finals. What do you mean? Stay back, Kaede. There's going to be bloodshed. Listen to me. Don't screw around with us! Guys! Let's kill these rats! You can't do that. Never! They're unrivaled. Those two are incredible. That's it! That's my Ohma! What's that? Stay away! Who's that? JERRY TYSON FIGHTER, 22ND CENTURY FAX Who's that weirdo? Is he a fighter too, Kaede? Maybe. I don't have much information about the other fighters. I think we have a clown here. You're my next prey, right? JERRY TYSON, 22ND CENTURY FAX RECORD: 3 WINS, 0 LOSSES TOTAL ASSETS ACQUIRED: 1 BILLION, 952 MILLION YEN OHMA TOKITA, YAMASHITA CORP RECORD: 3 WINS, 0 LOSSES TOTAL ASSETS ACQUIRED: 15 BILLION, 414 MILLION YEN Ohma. What is this trick? He turned so quickly. That's no human move. I'm not going to stop, boy. Not anytime, not ever. I'll keep chasing my enemies until they're destroyed. That's my Xing Yi Quan. Jerry Tyson, 32 years old. He's from Detroit, USA. At the age of 17, he moved to China because of his father's business. What he discovered in this new land was... Chinese kung fu. CHINESE KUNG FU Xing Yi Quan is one of its styles, developed by mimicking or channeling the forms and movements of various animals. However, a question arose in Jerry's mind. Why animals? Why did he have to mimic animals when they're weaker than human beings? Then he realized something. He should really mimic humans... No, their... weapons. WEAPONS Seven years later, he created J-style Xing Yi Quan, mimicking modern weapons. Its most powerful move is... Take this Scud Missile! It's a powerful punch which uses the entire mass of the body. Idiot! Your side is open-- You're the idiot. My kung fu style has no dead zone. Attacking me when I'm moving this fast is like running into a large truck. Just give up. Surrender yourself to my attack. SORYU FORM: WEEPING WILLOW He'll crash into the wall! It's impossible to make a sudden stop at this speed. Just joking! Did you think I'd let you beat me that easily? I won't let you enjoy a victory that's sweeter than Mom's apple pie. He repositioned himself! Using the wall, I've now got even more speed! I'm now like... a full metal jacket bullet! A girl? Why is a non-fighter here? Adjust my course? Brake? No time left! Use your brain, Jerry! Think what to do! Make a decision now! I can't. IMPOSSIBLE Sorry, girl. You won't die at least, so please forgive me. Oh? Jeez... you should have screamed. -Ohma! -Saving you isn't rewarding. But I like a strong-minded woman. Please, don't joke around in this situation. How... How was I the one to get blown out? You don't get it? I don't like to use this technique because it's not cool. Be careful. Unlike the Redirection Kata, I can't control my power when doing this. TOKITA TOWN IN THE ILLEGAL ZONE OF JAPAN, KNOWN AS "NAKA" You still don't understand, do you? Darn! Why won't it go in? NIKO TOKITA, OHMA'S MASTER OF NIKO STYLE As I said, there's no point trying that. You'd better not use your bare hands. Oh, boy. I told you not to. All right, now I'll explain to you why your fists got hurt, in a scientific way. Question. If you had a kilo of tofu and a kilo of iron, which would be more painful if they hit you at the same speed? -I'll kill you! -Listen to me. What I'm trying to tell you is that the harder object will be more painful. Watch carefully, okay? At the moment of impact, tense your muscles. It's quite something, right? Tense every one of your muscles the moment before impact, then smash your steel-like body into the object. It's Indestructible, the basic technique in the Adamantine Kata of the Niko style. So, are you interested in learning the Niko style now? Not at all! What the hell, I'll borrow... your Niko style. Are you going to challenge me head-on, even when I'm heavier than you? You're underestimating me. Miracles don't happen twice. With this technique specialized in attack, I make sure to destroy the enemy. NIKO STYLE - ADAMANTINE KATA: INDESTRUCTIBLE It's more than mimicking. The boy himself is the weapon. He won! That's my Ohma! In some ways, you were quite strong. Oh, I forgot to ask his name. Darn it! Why can't I take him down? Damn you! How can my submission hold be resisted by a moron with only brute force? A piece of cake! Your primitive fighting style hasn't changed. You're also in this match, Sawada? That's what I wanted to say. You're such a poor loser. I'll finish you off. You're still such a big mouth. Just bring it on, queer! Queer... queer... Don't... Don't call me a queer, you brat! Hey, Lihito! Don't get smart with me, or I'm pretty sure I'll kill you. Your hairstyle is disgusting, queer. How dare you call me disgusting, you little shit! Is that true? I'm quite certain, sir. That's impossible. It's too soon. The preliminary match only started 15 minutes ago. So, you guys are the ones who'll be the sideshow to my main act in the finals. LIHITO FIGHTER, SH FROZEN STORAGE KEIZABURO SAWADA FIGHTER, MURDER MUSIC YOSHINARI KARO FIGHTER, AJIRO FISHERIES HASSARD FIGHTER, BERCY PETROLEUM OHMA TOKITA FIGHTER, YAMASHITA CORPORATION I can't believe this. Shoot! I predicted all five of them would qualify! Darn it! If I had placed a bet I could've earned big. It would have helped me pay off my debt. Ohma Tokita, my dear. I knew it. You'd never lose to those fools. I can't wait to kill you or get lovingly killed by you. SETSUNA KIRYU FIGHTER, KOUOU EDUCATION GROUP Ohma, sweetie! Oh, dear. I feel the mood is too tense for a ceremony. Look! Chairman Katahara is here! METSUDO KATAHARA, GOVERNOR OF DAINIPPON BANK & KENGAN ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN Gentlemen! Congratulations for making it through the preliminary match. Or maybe I should say, commiserations for not losing in the preliminary match. I originally planned to have a meeting tomorrow morning, but... Hmm... what's wrong? Hassard. EISAKU SUZUKI PRESIDENT, BERCY PETROLEUM Hassard, don't. Mr. Katahara. I have a question to ask you. Oh, my... he's so gorgeous! Why did you impose the preliminary match only on us? I want a good explanation from you. What kind of factors were being considered other than our abilities? Don't flatter yourself, impudent brat! What? The top 28 in the company hierarchy of the Kengan Association were exempted from the first match because they already have excellent results. The company hierarchy? We live in a world where merchants' companies struggle for dominance. It's hilarious that a tool like you would argue over your merchant's head. You should remember that you fighters are just pawns. Well, then I'll teach you... how strong a pawn can be. Hey, wait! Rats! God, the blood... -Thank you, Yodoe. -Anytime. No, Hassard! What was that? He finished him in a flash. Metsudo Katahara's private army, known as the Guards, are his shield while Fang is his pike. It's an army of monsters with extraordinary strength. How silly! He acted up without considering his own ability. Now the number of fighters is down to 32 because of him. But an even number is good. Really? What kind of monsters are going to show up in the finals? I have nothing but bad feelings about this tournament. PREVIEW On The Kengan, a gorgeous ship, schemes, conspiracies and everything else is possible. Who are you? A dark horse predicts the divine move.
