 [sweeping orchestral music] - California is my home, from the majestic slopes of Lake Tahoe to the less cool slopes of Big Bear to the awesome beaches of Malibu. I love it here, and I have served this beautiful state for the past three years. - Hey, Governor Zack. You saved my life out there! And those tax cuts really resuscitated my bank account.

 How can I ever repay you? - No need. Just doing my job. California is where my story began. I grew up in the Palisades. I married my high school sweetheart, Kelly and became a successful trial attorney who always fought for what was cool. My calling to politics came later. As part of a scheme to get out of paying a $75 parking ticket, I decided to run for governor, and I won! But it hasn't always been easy. I've had to make some tough decisions-- decisions that have kept me

 and my still smokin' hot wife, Kelly, awake at night. - As governor, my husband had to cut $10 billion in education spending. And yes, that led to some school closures. But it also led to reduced loan rates for small businesses and a bailout for the fossil fuel industry. And as a busy mom, that's important to me. Wait, Zack, I can't say that. - But I believe in public education. Kelly and I both attended Bayside High, and we sent our son, Mac Morris, there as well. School should be an awesome experience, a time for kids to evade math homework and torment their principal with no consequences. That's what I had and what I'm fighting for for every student in California. We will figure this out together. I'm Governor Zack, and I approve this message. [triumphant end chords] - Hey! I figured it out. How about give us the $10 billion back? - It's wild, Aisha. It's like he doesn't get how crappy half the schools in California are. What world is he living in? [lively synth rock] - Ah, Bayside. Hey, girls, you wanna go skinny dipping tonight? I just flooded the gym. [girls chuckle] Now, that's what I call a double date. - Hey, Mac! - Hey, Jamie! You ready for the big game against Valley this weekend? - I wish. Coach says I have to pass my geography test, or I can't play. - Why is your book upside-down? - I'm reading about Australia. - [sighs] You think you got problems? I accidentally planned my birthday party on the same night as my parents' anniversary party. - Okay, Lexi, hundred bucks says you can't make them divorce before Saturday. - Oh, you're on, Preppy. [school bell rings] - Oh. Well. Time to go to class. - Ugh. Don't remind me. We're climbing the rope in gym today. - Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that. [Toddman panting] - Mac Morris, did you flood the gym again? The volleyball team floated away! Linda, call the Coast Guard! [all laugh] - Sorry, Principal Toddman! Man, I love this school! [school bell rings] - * When I wake up in the mornin' * * Alarm gives out a warnin' * * I don't think I'll ever make it on time * [school bell ringing] * By the time I grab my books * * And I give myself a look * * I'm at the corner just in time * * It's all right, it's all right * * Saved by the bell, it's all right * * It's all right, saved by the bell * * It's all right * * 'Cause I'm saved by the bell * [school bell ringing] [soft percussive music] - Good morning, teachers and students. I know Douglas High isn't perfect. The truth is, this place was struggling even before the governor's latest budget cuts. But I love this school, and I know I can make it a better place. - * Pick it up * * Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up * * Pick it up, pick it up * -Mm. I'm sorry, can you turn that off, please? - No problem. [ringtone stops] Hello? No, yeah, I can talk. What up, man? - Um, that's why I'm running for this year's Sophomore Class President. 'Cause it's not too late for Douglas High. It's not too late for any of us-- - Sorry, kids! School's shut down. - What? - Wow, they shutting down the school. - Yeah, unfortunately, this isn't a high school anymore. I mean, the state will probably rent it out so that TV shows about high schools can shoot here, but it's not an actual high school anymore. Uh, no need to panic. You can learn everything you need on the internet. Take it all. - No-- - Watch your step. [overlapping chatter] - Governor Zack! - Governor Zack! - Uh, hey. [chuckles] What's up? - You have provided no plan for the students affected by your disastrous education cuts. - Mm-hmm, that is a great point--thank you. - Where do you propose these students go? To other underfunded schools that don't have the resources to handle the kids they already have? - Look, I didn't want to close the schools. I feel terrible for these kids! To be honest, I needed to balance the budget. I didn't know how. I just Googled what they did last year, and I did it again! [laughs] Come on, like, none of you guys have made a $10 billion mistake before? all: Boo! - Ah, guys, guys, come on, come on, I know I can fix this. I believe in public education. I went to public school. My son is a student at Bayside High, and just the other night, when I was tucking him in, he asked me, "Papa, why--" - Maybe they should go there. - Hmm? - Maybe the students whose schools you closed should be sent to schools in high property tax areas like Bayside. - [laughs] Well. It's a little more complicated than that. - That's actually a great idea. - Is it? - Sounds really fair. Maybe you should be the governor! - Me? Yeah, right. - I don't think he should be governor. - I mean, I was a political science major. - Yeah, okay, okay, hey. Yes, that is a good plan. So I promise that all students affected by the shutdown will be sent to schools in well-funded districts, including Bayside! - There you go! [overlapping chatter] - Yeah. Governor. - So you're saying my daughter's gonna have to take a two-hour bus ride just to get to school every morning? - Yes, but I'm told the buses will be equipped with a modest selection of discarded magazines. - And we don't know these people! How can we be sure that Bayside's gonna be a safe, welcoming environment for our kids? - It'll be fine! Who doesn't love kids? - They gather together! They loiter! I'm just saying, how do we know we can trust them? [crowd murmurs in agreement] - Look, these concerns about a criminal element are unwarranted and offensive, and for the record, sir, you are currently on probation for embezzling money from a nursing home. - Hi, Jade Huntington-Snell, Tanner's mom. I just wanna say that my husband and I are involved in a number of inner city youth charities, so we are really excited about the new students. - Yes, as am I, and I think the thing we're losing sight of is that these are kids, good, bright kids just like yours, whom the system has failed. - Couldn't agree more. That said, I read a Facebook article about an underground sex cult where the kids snort Baby Yoda and worship the YouTube demon Momo. What are you gonna do to stop this? - I can assure you, we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to whatever it is you're talking about. Now, if there are no other questions... all right, I'm gonna hand this over to our school counselor. In addition to her work at Bayside, she's written over a dozen bestsellers, including her parenting how-to, "I'm So Excited, I'm So Scared... Of Becoming a Parent." [chuckles] Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Jessica Spano. - Thank you, Ron. Now, I know you're all concerned about the changes coming to Bayside, and I get it. As many of you know, my son Jamie is a student here as well. Of course, I want what's best for him, but Douglas students' parents feel the same. And that's why I've devised a system to help ease the transition. Each new student will be paired with a current student or... "Bayside buddy" to help them acclimate. - And so the current students can keep an eye on them. - Yes. both: No! [smooth rock music] - Hey, nice job up there, Mama. Sorry, I know we had the HR meeting about this. Dr. Mama. - That's not what we settled on. - So where's your husband? Laying in front of a bulldozer, saving some female frogs or whatever? - How dare you. René drank some essential oils and has been vomiting. - Cool. - What are you even doing here? You never come to PTA meetings. - Excuse me if I want to stay informed about potential changes that could affect my students. The hot dog I was cooking for dinner exploded in my microwave, and I knew they'd have these little donuts I liked. - Right. Slater, I'm really worried about this year. I just hope we can make a safe space for these new students. - Yeah. But I'm also kinda excited. The Douglas football team went 6 and 2 last year. The only thing our team has ever won is when the guys did the "Pitch Perfect" cup song in the talent show. - Bayside has plenty of talented athletes. What about my son, Jamie? - [laughs] [clears throat] Oh, you're, uh, you're serious. Yeah, Jamie is--uh-- oh look, here comes Ron! Whassup, Ron? - I'll tell you "whassup," Slater, these parents are driving me crazy! Why is everything my fault? Don't they know I'm completely powerless? I asked the superintendent for a chair that doesn't have "little bitch" carved into it. He said, "We'll look into it... little bitch!" He's gonna call me. [upbeat rock music] - So, you excited for the first day of school? - Girl, no. Douglas sucked, but at least we knew all the tricks. Don't eat the meatloaf. Don't get into a fight with No-Eyebrows Stacey. Is it weird that I kind of miss her? I wonder who she's choking out these days. - Well, I'm excited. Going to Bayside is gonna change our lives. I got it all planned out. - Hey, where the dick is this school? Why is the bus stop 100 miles away from the building? - I guess most of the kids drive? Damn, look at all these fancy cars. It's like a poster in my little brother's room. - Why is everybody so rich? It's a public school. - Oh, no, look, there's a couple crappy ones. - Ah. [chuckles] That's the teachers' lot. - Oh. - Yeah. Come on. * * Daisy! * * - Oh, wow. It's so nice here. It's almost messed up how nice it is. Like, I knew it wouldn't have graffiti, but I think that's a Banksy. Aisha. Aisha, are you even listening to me? - No, no, not at all. That is the hottest man I have ever seen. Oh, my God, he's coming. Shut up, shut up! - Hi, um...do either of you know Aisha? I'm her Bayside Buddy. - Yeah, I'm Aisha. It's great to meet you. This is--don't remember. - I'm Jamie Spano. - Hey. Maybe you know my buddy. Somebody named...Mac Morris? - Damn it, Lexi! - Ah, Mac. There he is. - Yeah, okay, I'm sorry, Mac, but I got the parking space fair and square. - Uh, I wouldn't call that fair. You drugged my toothpaste and I woke up at Six Flags. Once I'm there, I'm not just gonna leave! This means war, Lexi. Parking spot war. - Oh, you're on, Preppy. Yeah. I will rob you of your sanity and lovingly nurse you back to health, only to destroy you again. Good luck! [chuckles] Girls? [all snap fingers] - Hi, uh, are you Mac? I think you're my Bayside Buddy. You're supposed to show me around. - Oh, awesome! Hey. Would you be able to lay down in a parking spot overnight so my frenemy can't park in it tomorrow? - [laughs] [record scratch] Time out. What did that blond fool just say to me? [upbeat synth music] * * - This is The Max. It's where we like to hang out after school. Also before and during. - Wait, so you guys go to a sit-down restaurant every day? Isn't that expensive? - Yeah! Oh, look. There's the gang. - [chuckles] - Hey, Aisha. And DeVante. What are you doing here? - Well, Lexi's my buddy, and she thought it might be nice for us to get the chance to know each other. - Mm-hmm. - And I thought it would be nice for her to give me 50 bucks, so... - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, DeVante, what TV do you watch? Have you seen my reality show, "Becoming Lexi, Colon, I Am Me?" - It's about Lexi's life, being transgender, her journey of self-discovery, and the hot friends who support her. - Yeah, if you watch it, I'm in episode 204: "The Big Game." At the end, I score the losing touchdown! - [laughs] I didn't know you played football, Jamie. - Really? 'Cause he's literally been holding a football all day. - Huh? Oh! - You know, Aisha used to play back at Douglas. - You did? Like, on the boys' team? - Uh, I mean, I didn't want to, but they cut the girls' athletic program. - But how could there not be sports for girls? That's like, illegal. - Why didn't your parents complain? - Or hold a fundraiser where they let Rita Wilson sing because that means Tom Hanks has to come. - Okay, this place is weird. - What do you mean? - Hope you're hungry for...magic! - Yeah! - Every time! - Oh! - Damn, I love magic! [upbeat music] - Dog, I'm telling you, man, this school is wild. Like, they got beach volleyball, and then a different club called "Beach Volleyball (Resort Sand)." No cap, and there's more people signed up for the "Artisanal Bath Bomb Club" than football. - Did someone say, "Football"? - Barely! - You know, uh, tryouts are tomorrow if you're interested. - Nah, I'm good. - Hey, you don't have to do that with me, man. I get where you're coming from. - I'm coming from the bathroom. You don't know me. - Know you? I was you. My dad was in the Army, and I bounced around from school to school. When I transferred to Bayside, I had no friends, and an "I don't give a frig" attitude. By the way, I'm saying "frig" 'cause I'm still at work, but after 3:00 p.m., I use the real word. - Cool. - But this place is magic. This is where I met friends and finally felt like I belonged. And, you know, football was a big part of that. - Yeah, man, I mean, that personal story really brought my guard down. By the way, what's my name? - Hmm? - No, I'm just saying, like, you know me so well, right? So...what's my name? - Uh... - Don't guess. - No, I wasn't going to. - Uh-oh. [snorts] My guard's going back up. - Tony? - And it's up. - And I was gonna go out with her, but then this much hotter girl asked me to go out. Long story short, I faked my own death and hooked up with the hot mortician. - Look, I've loved all 87 of these stories, but can you please just tell me where I can get my textbooks? - Yeah, we're here. Bayside is 99% paperless, so getting your books is kind of a pain in the ass. [device boops] Ugh. That took forever. - But what if I don't have one of those? What if I can't do a boop-boop? - Don't have? What is... what is that? [curious music] - You were right. Bayside sucks. They won't let me take any honors classes 'cause they said the Douglas curriculum doesn't meet their standards. I know our school library was just a Bible and a bunch of army pamphlets, but I'm as smart as any kid here. No. Smarter. It's not fair. - Yeah, it, uh...sucks. - Wait. Do you like it here? - I'm sorry! - Oh, my God! - They just-- they have everything! Fancy teachers, money for sports, and the cafeteria's sponsored by Wolfgang Puck, and he is here! Is it so bad to want to enjoy that? - Are you actually enjoying it? Or are you just dickmatized by stupid Jamie? Since when are you so shy about how good you are at football? At Douglas, you asked the coach if you could play without a helmet. - Yeah, so they would know it was Aisha puttin' them numbers on the scoreboard! Girl, look, I know that this school has problems, but it's our first day. - Exactly. And it's already unfair! If you don't have an iPad, if you ride the bus, if you're not one of them, you're set up to fail. We need someone to fight for us who knows us. That's why I have to be student council president. Now, more than ever. - But you know your posters have to be in by tomorrow. - What? Who said? - Uh, they sent out a message about it on the Bayside Student app. - What the hell's a Bayside Student app? You see? We're set up to fail. You know, some of us don't have smartphones 'cause their moms say they're too expensive, and... [speaking Spanish] I hate this school. And I hate this phone! - Mr. Morris, get your feet off my desk. - Can I flip over your trashcan and put 'em on that? - No! In general, be less comfortable in here! What do you want? - Lexi and I are in a parking spot war, but I was reading the student manual, and it gave me an idea. What if you gave me your spot and you Ubered from now on? - Mr. Morris, my car already is an Uber. - Mr. Toddman. - Hey, buddy. - Hi. Sir, I wanted to ask about the student council elections. Is it too late to enter the race? - No, not at all! As long as your posters are up before homeroom tomorrow. - Oh, that's great. Thank you. - Oh, Daisy, I'm so pleased. You know, I found a passage you might be interested in. I tell you, you Douglas kids have given me a sense of purpose around here. It's easy to get discouraged in this job when you're trying to make a difference but you feel like you're talking to a brick wall. [light music] * * - Hey! You know how nervous I was about today, but I feel like we're off to a great start with the Douglas kids. - Yeah, that's the kind of start I'm off to as well. [sniffs] - Oh, no! What happened? I made Jamie some ants on a log. Do you need a snack? - I was trying to get this kid from Douglas to join the football team, but I blew it. - Mm. - How do you get a kid to listen to you? - Slater. If I knew that, I'd be the greatest counselor in the world, and my son wouldn't have named his dog "Porno." - It's just, I know how it feels to be all alone in a new school, and... and trying to join in, but you just don't know how. - He told you all that? - Not in...so many words. - Look, we all want these new kids to feel welcome and succeed at Bayside, but it's not gonna work if we don't get to know them, and not just their names. - Yeah. 'Cause I definitely knew his name. - How they feel, what they think... we have to stop trying to get through to them and let them get through to us. It's our job to make space for every kid at Bayside so they become a healthy and mature adult. - Hey, Mom, can I get my ants on a log while you sing to me, please? Is that them? - I brought these. [Daisy scoffs] [buttons beeping] [line trilling] - Hey. - Mom, I can't pick up Hector. I gotta make posters for the election. - I'm sorry, mija. There's no one to switch with me. - See, this is why we need a home computer. [Daisy's mother speaking Spanish] - [sighs] Fine. Bye. I love you. [upbeat rock music] * * - Can I get one "PJ Mask" book? - No! - God's gonna punish you for not letting a child read. - * I got my hair slicked back * * And my boots on * - Let's go. - * Eyeshadow too * * I got my nails stuck on * - Are you still open? - For ten minutes. So if you're thinking of shipping a bulk item that requires a specialty box outside of continental U.S., do not darken my doorway, girl. - Nope. Just printing a couple pictures. - [sighs] This is boring! - $21.86. - Stupid overpriced magician restaurant. Okay, I have a little problem. I only have a 10.00. Wait! No! Listen. I need these 'cause I'm running for class president. At a new school where people like me don't really have a voice. But if I win, maybe I can change all that. So I'm asking you...Dean. Do you want $21? Or do you want to help me change the-- - $21. - Just give it to her. She's a single mom. - Yeah. Please. Do it for my beautiful boy. - You lucky today's my birthday. - Ooh! Happy birthday. * * - Hey, buddy. - Wait, you're running for president? - Yeah, according to the student manual, class president gets the parking spot right in front of school. - Which is even better than the parking spot we were previously fighting over. That's why I'm running as well. - Wait, how did you make all these so fast? [together] Do you not have a poster guy? [phone rings] - Oh. Oh. LeBron must be here. He said he'd come help me hand out buttons. - Ugh. Big deal. I have a Kardashian coming at lunch. - Yeah? Who? Rob? - Shut up! He is still in their family. - Hey, man. No, you can wear your jersey. I don't think it's thirsty. [whispering] He's so thirsty. - It's okay. I worked hard on my posters, I'm still gonna put up my posters. [tense music] Hey, where can I put up my posters?! - Hold on, Bron-Bron. Did you not reserve wall space on the Bayside Student app? - Aw... [Daisy screams] [school bell rings] - Hey, buddy. - Hiya. - You okay? - Yeah. [record scratch] Don't start crying. - Why were you so upset earlier? - I wasn't upset. - Do you... want to go to The Max and have a dance contest about it? - [voice breaks] No. [record scratch] Oh, no, too late. Look, I always believed that if you worked hard enough, anything was possible. But being here made me realize that's only true for kids like you. - Hot kids? - Privileged kids. - Privileged kids... - One of you will be class president, and you'll put it on an application to a college that your parents already paid your way into. The deck is stacked so high in your favor that people like me never even had a chance. And it's too bad, 'cause I would've been a great president. I actually want to make the school better. I want to go to Washington for the Spring Break Leadership Conference. I want everyone's voices to be heard. But you don't. You just want a parking space. [school bell rings] - [sighs] Man, did you hear that? - Yeah... the president has to spend spring break at a leadership conference? - I can't do that. That's when I go on spring break. - I would literally die. - We have to make this better. - We have to make this right. - Sorry, I thought you were gonna say "better." - I wasn't. - Hey, man. Can we talk? - Did you just sit backwards in a chair? Wow, I've never seen anyone do that in real life. - Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. And you're right. I don't know you. Honestly, I was just looking out for myself. It may seem like I'm a hot, happening guy who's got it all together-- - You're a gym teacher, and I saw you eating soup in your car. - That was melted ice cream. [sighs] But... the truth is, I need a win. I'm a director of an athletics program that hasn't beaten Valley in 15 years. Anyway, I'm sorry... and I wanna listen. - Look, you're not the first person to look at me and ask if I played football. I can't do anything without people making assumptions about me. I play football, I'm up to no good, I'm related to Montell Jordan-- which I am, but it's through marriage. The point is, even if I wanted to join in, it's not that simple. - Man. Back when I went to Bayside, if you had a problem, it could usually be fixed with a vaguely inspirational speech, but... That doesn't seem like it's gonna work here, huh? - No. - And you wouldn't want me to try, even if I thought of a good one based on what you told me, right? - Well, technically, it's not a white savior thing because you're Mexican, so... - Thank you! No one ever talks about that. Look, man. You're never gonna be able to control what people assume about you, so if there's something you want to do here, something that can make you happy, well, you might as well just go for it and let people assume what they want. - All right, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Coach. - You're welcome, DeVante. - That's not how you pronounce my name. I'm just messing with you. That's a joke. You did all right. - You got me. [low soft rock music] * * - Attention, please, it is now time to hear from our candidates for sophomore class president. Mr. Morris, would you like to begin with-- ah! Stop! [smack] Ow! Ow! [door slams shut] - Good morning, Bayside. I'm Mac Morris, and I believe in the power of a good idea. Like my idea that teachers should randomly give you Fs for no reason and that we should get rid of school dances and use that money to plant a weird tree. Thank you. [record scratch] - Wait. Is he trying to lose? - And now, for our next presidential candidate, Daisy! - [mouths word] What? - Hi, Bayside! I'm Daisy. And I promise to get Lizzo to perform at prom, and the theme will be, "Everybody Gets 50 Bucks." - I don't know who this Daisy girl is, but she sounds great. - Okay, wait. They're lying. I'm Daisy! They're pretending to be me. - In my Bayside, every lamp will be a ring light so no one will be an uggo. - No, no! That's not my platform. I was running for president 'cause I wanted to give people like me a voice, and now these white ding-a-lings are literally stealing my voice! - So do you want us to vote for Daisy or not? - Well--I mean-- I want to be class president, but not if it's-- - And God as my witness, I vow that each and every student will get their own micro pig. - Yes! * * - All right, everybody. Line up. - Hold up, Coach. I think we got one more coming. And that kid looks tough as hell. - Hey, Coach! - Hey. - [knocks on door] - Daisy! Hey, congratulations on your win. - Thanks, but... I can't be class president. I mean, I don't deserve it. That wasn't me giving the speech this morning. - Oh, I know. Mac and Lexi locked me in a dark supply closet so they could use the PA. I was very scared. But you don't have to bow out! You did technically win! - Yeah, but I wanted to win the right way. I wanted it to be fair. - Oh. Have a seat. Listen, it was never going to be fair. Was it fair you only heard about the election yesterday? And Mac's campaign jingle was written by Migos? Was it fair these kids were born in the Palisades and you weren't? Daisy! The universe got one right today. You're here, and you're the president. And you certainly proved to me... that you deserved it. - Where did you get those? - Oh, I have a deal with the janitor. He just gives me all the cool stuff the kids throw out. I got a Gucci hat and a necklace. That smells. - Cool. - Listen. These kids... they can be sheltered and clueless. But there's one thing they get right. They never feel guilty about taking their seat at the table. And I know you deserve a seat there too. And if you don't take it, Daisy... how else are we gonna make this place a little more fair? - Yeah. Thanks, Principal Toddman. * * - Whassup? I'm DeVante Young, and I'm here to audition for the musical. - Mm-kay. Whenever you are ready. [clears throat] - * I believe * * The children are our future * * Teach them well and let them lead the way * * Show them all the beauty they possess * * Inside * * Give them a sense of pride * * To make it easier * * Let the children's laughter * * Remind us how we used to be * * I decided long ago * * Never to walk in anyone's shadow * * If I fail, if I succeed * * At least I lived as I believed * * No matter what they take from me * * They can't take away my dignity * * Because the greatest * * Love of all is happening to me * * * - Hey, buddy. Listen. No need to thank us for rigging the race. - Yeah, all we ask in return is that you give us the president's parking spot. - And we actually learned a pretty important lesson this week. It's great to win, but sometimes, it's even better... [together] to share. - Hm. No. both: What? - I said no. I'm the president, and that parking space is mine. - [scoffs] Are you kidding me, brah? - Okay, but you don't even have a car. What are you gonna use a parking spot for? - What is she doing? - * Because the greatest * * Love of all is happening to me * [vocalizing] - First order of business. I want to move the bus stop. You know the president's parking spot right in front of the school? I want to move it there. - * I found the greatest * * Love of all * * Inside * * Of * * Me * We good? - Yeah. - Cool. [upbeat pop music] * * - * Don't need to tell you * * What you already know * * * * Don't wanna hear you say * * That you told me so * * * * Can't even argue * * I wouldn't know where to start * * * * How many letters * * To spell a broken heart? * * *
