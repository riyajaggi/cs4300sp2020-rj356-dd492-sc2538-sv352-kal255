 Go on, son! Go on! -[ Whistle blows]
-Referee! REFEREE:
All right. Calm down. Come on! You -- You're off the pitch.
Go on. Are you blind or bent,
you ignorant fecker? Well done, kid.
Well done. Go on, Finbar!
You're doing great, lad! [ Grunts ]
Don't drop it, Steve. What is this?
Am I paying for this?

 RAY:
It's all taken care of. Can you give us a hand, though? It looks very heavy. RAY: That's a mark
of pure quality, that is. PETE:
Do you got it there, fellas? Yeah. Cheers, Pete.
[ Grunts ] Great help. That is so ugly. That...is perfect
is what that is. That's perfect. Hey, Pete, we need to sort out
a lease. Don't worry.
You're grand. If I'm gonna register this place
as my office, I'm gonna need some sort
of security of tenure. 
  subslikescript square adaptive  
 
 I can do the paperwork
if you like. Yeah.
Sure. Cool. -Tara?
-Yeah? You're gonna be late. I don't have any meetings. Your mother. See you later. Here.
Hang on a sec. What? Da? Da! Da! Da. Connor!
Call an ambulance! .. MAN: Are we going
straight to resource? Barry O'Brien, 57. Post-collapse
following hematemesis. He's hypotensive. Systolic is 80.
Tachycardiac at 120. Date of birth --
2nd of the 4th, 1960. WOMAN: Yeah.
We've got him here on file. MAN: I'm sorry.
Please, can you wait here? Hello.
Mrs. O'Brien? I'm calling from
St. Jude's General Hospital. Yeah, Mum.
Hi. Da's in the hospital. WOMAN:
What? Okay. I understand.
Yeah. I'll be straight there. Kids? I have to run into town, okay? He's in here, Mrs. O'Brien. MAN:
Blood count's still dropping. Oh, Barry. Get me two more units
of packed red cells -- one for PFP
and another pool of platelets. -Set him up for dialysis.
-Well, what is it? Acute organ failure. We're doing what we can
to support him. He's been overdoing it
with painkillers, it seems, mixed with alcohol. He's in a very serious
condition, I'm afraid. Oh, Barry, sweetheart. -What is going on?
-I don't know. They -- They let
some random woman in, and she says she's Mrs. O'Brien. What do you mean,
she said she was Mrs. O'Brien? FINBAR:
That's just what she said. I'd presumed
it was a different O'Brien, but she's sitting there
beside Da now. Is this my Barry? Yes, it is. -What's going on?
-Excuse me. Who are you? I'm Corrine O'Brien.
I'm his wife. So what -- what,
is he dying or what? -His condition is very serious.
-And who's this? Mrs. Mouse? I'm Julie O'Brien, Barry's wife. Are you some sort
of ambulance-chasing nut? -Why don't you just --
-I am his wife. -I don't know who you are.
-I've had enough of this shite. -Get your arms off -- Stop it!
-Get up. -Get your hands off of me.
-MAN: Call security now. Let go of me.
Stop it. Please! Please stop it.
Please. Somebody -- Hey!
Hey there! I don't know who you think
you are. Get rid of that nut. She's one of those
ambulance chasers. -Mum.
-Hello, love. Hi. -Have you changed your hair?
-No. It looks nice. Thank you. You busy? Yeah. Good. Can we just order? -Sorry.
-It's fine. Do you know I've never had
the cream tea here? Well, you don't have to worry
about your weight now that the wedding's -- One cream tea, please. Um, two.
Thanks. WOMAN:
Thank you. Dad sends his love. Does he? Well, maybe not in those words,
but... And you're getting work? Mm. You're not missing Dunbar's? No. A regular salary, job security. Eric across the office. No, not missing Dunbar's. Eric is... Your new workmates --
I hear they are quite... Wholly unsuitable? -[ Laughs ] Yeah.
-Yeah. But I like them. And I like my office. I don't have to think about
the people that I've let down. Um, I can just focus on my work. You will never find anyone
quite like Eric, you know. Well, that is a comfort. Mum, I know that Eric
is a wonderful man and that I should be so lucky. You say that Dad was no angel,
whatever that means. And I know I've wasted hours
of your time and loads of your money
on my abandoned wedding. But...it's gone. Darling, I only want you
to be happy. Stop it. It's just this constant need
to mold me and manipulate me. You've always done it. Every day
on the drive to school, never happy
with how I did my hair or what I was wearing
or who my friends were. This is my life, okay, Mum? These are my choices. Why can't you just let me be? -Thank you.
-Thank you. Ray? Hey, Tara.
There's a new client for you. Okay. I'm at St. Jude's now.
I'll wait for you here. I'm on my way. Ray. No. Uh, your man here,
Barry O'Brien, he's a serious punter, like. What, bigamy? Well, two women claim
the same man's their husband. I don't know the legal term
and all, but... No.
That's bigamy. RICHARD: I can't stress the
importance of this enough, Eric. This is very delicate, so I
want to bring it down quietly. ERIC:
Quietly? We're talking about
Corrine O'Brien here. Exactly.
Which is why I'm sending you. Good luck. Thanks, Dad. CORRINE:
Yeah, that's what I mean. And you should see
the state of her. Horrible little mousy thing,
she is. How can I help you? Martin Swanton,
head of the hospital legal team. Yes.
Tara Rafferty. My soliciter. -Hi.
-Hi. Oh, that's how it is, is it?
Battle of the briefs? Well, good luck with that. Eric.
Just in time. JULIE:
You have to get me to him. He's my husband, and he's
fighting for his life in there. Of course.
Let me take your full details. Okay.
Name? Juliet Hannah Antonia O'Brien. Okay.
And you don't have a soliciter? Well, I contacted Dunbar's,
and they said I should call you. Okay. And, uh, what year
did you get married? Sorry. Could you just give me
one second, please? Sorry to interrupt. Could I just speak to Mr. Dunbar
for a moment, please? Excuse me. Did you pass her on to me? Of course not. Your office did. I'm telling you, I didn't know.
I'd much rather -- Look. Perhaps you should pass on this,
give it to someone else. Excuse me? Conflict of interest. It's gonna get messy,
and not for our side. Really? -Sorry.
-2005. That's when we were married --
2005. Ask her does he have
any distinguishing marks. Sorry.
Can we have a moment, please? He has four scars on his abdomen
from a gallbladder operation. They're not from an operation. He was shot four times in Spain
by an amateur. [ Whispering ]
I told you it was pretty tasty. It was keyhole surgery
in this hospital. -I was with him.
-Oh, were you with him? Tara, that consent form
is probably here. -Do you want me to get it?
-Yes. Sorry. Could you just give me
one more moment, please? Meg, I need you
to check someone out for me. Barry O'Brien. Uh, 2nd of the 4th, 1960. Just marriage records,
background details -- anything that you can find. Who is the next of kin? I am. DR. LEVINS: Mr. O'Brien has
acute liver failure. -I need consent before I --
-I am his wife. -You are in your hole his wife!
-Calm down. Corrine -- Calm down. This will get sorted.
Now, don't worry. -Right. Okay.
-MAN: Dr. Levins? Consent form --
gallbladder surgery, signed by Barry O'Brien. So? So he wasn't shot. What? Keyhole surgery naming Julie
O'Brien as the next of kin. Is that Barry's handwriting
and signature? I am his wife and the mother
of his two children. His children?! -Keep her away!
-Corrine, please! -Please!
-Corrine, please! He needs a new liver,
and he needs it now. A related donor would be best, but I'll also contact Vincent's
and see if they can help. Might I suggest that the team continue their
preparations for a transplant and the two parties present
their marriage certificates as soon as possible so you can decide
who might have access? -That sounds very sensible.
-Okay. Corrine, please. Please. -What do we do now?
-Where is your marriage cert? -It's at home.
-Okay. -We need to go and get that.
-Ray. ERIC:
Tara? This must be hell
for the two women. We've got to keep things
civilized for their sakes. Of course. Julie, we'd better
get a move on. -Will I come with you?
-Yes. Dad.
Pretty tricky, to be honest. Not helped by the fact that Tara's heading up
the opposition. Yeah. TARA:
What's Barry like? JULIE:
He's lovely. Different. Free spirit.
Yeah. TARA:
Did you have any idea? Not a clue. And he never mentioned
a previous marriage? No. Was he in a relationship
when you two got together? Not that I knew of. He travels a lot on business, at the drop of a hat,
wherever the wind takes him. He's always been like that. -And you never suspected?
-[ Cellphone ringing ] Sorry.
I need to take this. Please, carry on. Meg? I hear Eric's on the case,
as it were. Yeah. Have you got your client
with you? -Yep.
-Not got the loudspeaker on? No. Right. Your man Barry is big
in property import/export, possibly involved
in organized crime. Took me five seconds
to find mention of Corrine. Nothing on your girl --
almost as if she doesn't exist. He's kept her very quiet. Okay. Do you think your woman knew
about the other wife? I think so.
Yeah. Well, mind how you go. Talk to you later. -If you'd like to go on through.
-Yeah. -Hi.
-How's Dad? Oh, Daddy is fine. Now, you run upstairs
and play for a bit. I need to pop out again. -WOMAN: Yeah. Sure. No problem.
-JULIE: Thanks. Right. Um, let's get you
that certificate. It's in here somewhere. -Here it is.
-Great. It was heavenly. Cancun.
Beautiful day. Are you married? No. We'd better get going. Lovely place. I have a gift. It's like a needle
in a haystack. When did you last see it? I don't know.
When we were married. He's so messy. He's hardly ever here. He's away on business a lot. What a fool I am. You'd think maybe a bit
on the side. You hope he doesn't catch
anything. But two kids?! If he dies,
they'll have to revive him so I can kill him
all over again. How could he? But you can tell it's true,
can't you? Yeah. Well, she's gonna pay. She is going to pay. SWANTON:
Yes. I see. Cancun, 10th of April 2005. -It all seems --
-Hello, everyone. We have a marriage certificate,
original, 1996... ...nine years earlier. Well, there's still the matter
of next of kin. A next of kin from the bonds, when Barry went
for cardiac work, signed by him, naming Corrine. But mine was more recent. As, I am afraid,
is your marriage certificate, which has no legal standing,
as Barry was already married. Well, it's very clear you two ladies cannot coexist
peacefully in this hospital. And I can't have
a medical team disturbed in the way they were earlier. As Corrine O'Brien's marriage
certificate appears to be valid, she is best placed
to represent Mr. O'Brien in his ongoing
medical treatment. What are you getting at?
Represent what? How can you leave him
in the hands of that woman? I have to be with him. Come on, Julie. I'm sorry. The surgeon will come
and find you, Mrs. O'Brien. He would like a word. Where have you been? Nowhere. Hiya, Da. He can't hear you. Yeah.
Maybe he can. Here you go. I can't bear to think of him
in there and with that woman. I don't trust her.
You have to get me to him. Okay.
I've been thinking. We could apply for an
emergency hearing before a judge to make a ruling about access or you having some say
in medical decisions, but... What? Well, it's just that a judge is only really interested
in the law. I mean, the fact
that there are two children is unfortunately
neither here nor there. But it's Corrine's
Irish marriage certificate that predates yours
by nine years. That's another thing. Julie, I have to be honest
with you. We don't have any cards to play
at the moment. But this is unbearable. I mean, he needs me. And if he dies,
we'll be left with nothing. He was sorting out a trust
for me and the children. But for some reason or another,
it never got signed. Why? Things just got
a bit overwrought. What do you mean? Okay. Tell me exactly what you
mean by "sorting out a trust." We went to see
Barry's solicitors, Dunbar's, a year ago, and... We'll have nothing,
Ms. Rafferty. We'll be broke, penniless. Uh, thank you for...
being so kind up there. Without you, that woman would... It's been a shock for her, too,
of course. But I'll do what I can. Thank you. I'll leave you to it. Tara. Eric. Did you meet him
when you went to Dunbar's? No. I don't know why, but
I'm totally overthinking this. I tend to do that. You will tell me
if I'm acting like an oddball? You're acting like an oddball. So how are you getting on
with Barry? Any leads? Um, 7:43. 7:43? I presume we're on the clock
if we're talking about work. I'm sorry. So what --
what will we talk about? When you're gonna pay me? Yeah. -I'll get this.
-Oh. Hey, thank you for tonight. It was very... Very. So I will crack on with my lead
on Barry's business dealings. Um, I'll let you know
how I get on. What is this?
Is this -- Is that for... It's for teething. Oh, my God. I've been out
of the singles game too long. What is teething? It's when your child
grows teeth. Yes. It's for my kid. Do you want a lift or... Um, no.
There's a rank up the road. But thank you. Mum, your phone.
Your phone. Ah. Doctor.
How is he? He's critically ill. The only liver available
in the country is a poor match. There's no better
than a 30% chance it'll take and much less chance
he'll survive the operation. But your son has asked me
if he can donate. I'm sorry.
What? We've taken samples
to see if there's compatibility. Without my permission? He's only 16. In medicine,
16 is the legal age of consent. Well, not in my house, it's not. The liver is remarkable. -It'll regenerate itself.
-No. -No. It's not gonna happen.
-I told you. We have to respect
your mother's wishes. The operation is not
without risk for the donor. Well, that's true,
but I think -- Then that's that. But I... Barry always said
he didn't want any heroics. He wanted to go out with a bang and not be a vegetable
and all that. All right. I will say the chances of
finding a suitable liver in time are receding fast. I suppose all we can do for now,
then, is to make him comfortable. What were you thinking? TARA: So Julie has
no online presence at all? MEG:
Nope. I've put together a lamb tagine.
Will you stay for some? Yeah. Okay.
What have you got for me? Barry's companies,
his properties. Neither of these lists
is comprehensive, by the way. Here on a Dunbar golf day. "Valued lifelong client." Is he a golfer? No. You can't run two women
and play golf. How could he do it? Two families, two homes,
two wives. I don't get it. So no mention of any divorces,
no other wives? Nothing. Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold. Boss? Where are you? Morocco. More to the point,
do you know where Vincent is? I can't get ahold of him. I'll tell you. But don't tell him I told you. VINCENT:
How did you know I was here? TARA:
Ray told me. Um, I'm sorry. I-I lost my, uh,
my phone charger, I guess. What's going on, Vincent? Hmm?
Oh. I just needed a little time away
from the family. You know, there's, uh, so much
work to do on the inquiry and, uh, well, it... Drink? No. I'm okay.
Thanks. And you, Tara...
have a career-defining case. You could work a lifetime
and never get a bigamy case. It could make your name. Yeah, as an idiot, maybe. It's really tough, Vincent,
you know? She's got two children with him
and this gorgeous home. And it's all been blown apart, and I'm completely unable
to help her. Would you mind looking? I'll just, uh... Thank you. Next-of-kin form...
two marriage certificates... trust-fund details, which may indicate some intent
from Barry towards Julie. It's worthless. You could get
into serious trouble wasting the judge's time
with this. I'm also pretty sure
Julie knew he was married -- maybe for some time. If you take this to court, she could be walking into
a whole world of pain, and so could you. On top of which, Barry and
Corrine are dangerous people. . . Ray? Tara. It's not what it looks like. What are you doing here? What's he doing here? He came over last night. He was wanting to see you,
but I was here, so... Why didn't you call me? It was midnight. He fell out with his mother. He was desperate.
He was wandering the streets. So he wanted to talk
and didn't want to go home, so we talked. It's true.
She just won't listen to me. He wants to be represented
separate from his mother. Ray, I can't do that. He wants to give a part
of his liver to his da. And his ma
is just getting in the way. She's not helping at all
with anything. Listen to me. You don't know
how serious this is. Finbar, you're the son
of the respondent. You can't be here. Please just go. I'm a match, and the doctor's
right up for it. He says 16 is the legal age
of consent. I'm 16.
I don't see what the problem is. Finbar, you're not listening
to me. You can't be here. Just leave. Ray, what are you doing?
I could get struck off for this. He won't say anything. I'll call him later
and make sure he keeps stone. Nothing happened --
nothing penetrative. This isn't a joke, Ray. Did you touch him? No, I didn't!
Who do you think I am?! What is this?
Have you been staying here? Little bit. I trusted you. You get out as well. What? Ray, I'm firing you.
Just go. Leave it. LUCY:
Hi, Tara. Lucy. I passed a case on to you,
one they flicked on. Don't tell Richard,
whatever you -- JULIE:
You'll be hearing from me again. Hello. We're here to see Eric. I called the hospital. They won't even tell me
how Barry is. They said I should ask his wife. And they've shut off my account,
frozen it. -Do you need money?
-No. There's bags of cash at home --
literally bags full of cash. Okay.
I didn't hear that. Mr. Dunbar will see you now. Okay. If they've shut off your
account, that could mean that... Corrine has control
of some of Barry's accounts. And despite me trying to
dissuade her, she has decided
to exercise that control. She is absolutely furious, and, well, we all need to tread
rather carefully to stop things escalating. Your office was preparing a trust arrangement for Julie
last year? Oh? I need those papers
and any relevant minutes to meetings
that my client attended. Well...I imagine it was
a private client's account. I'll check. Chinese walls and all that.
Excuse me. -What are Chinese walls?
-Can I speak to Fiona, please? It's when one part
of the company pretends it doesn't know
what the other part is doing. It's legal fantasy. ERIC:
Hi. Could I see... Oh, he was there --
at the trust meeting. ERIC:
Correct. Can you bring me a copy?
Thank you. It seems they were never
formally completed, but they're on their way. Julie, rest assured
that with the DNA results, which, of course,
will be a formality, and this great soliciter
by your side, your children will be more than
amply provided for when Barry... What, Eric? W-When he what?
What's going on? It has been agreed to -- Oh, my God.
She's letting him die? It's a purely medical decision
not to try any extreme measures, just to make him comfortable. Comfortable as in dead? They don't have
a suitable donor. Yes, they do. What do you mean? I'll explain. What are you planning to do? I'm gonna get this
in front of a judge. You have nothing. You'll be humiliateed. Maybe. Tara? Be careful. You did know
that Barry was married. You found out
at that trust meeting. -That's why ended abruptly.
-What can I say? We have two children together,
a home and a life. I love him, and he loves me.
The rest is just paperwork. Well, does this mean
you can't represent me anymore? No.
Of course not. You go home.
I'll call you later. I was really enjoying
working there, you know? I thought Tara found me useful. So I don't know how I'm going to
do my structured repayments on my fine and all. They'll chuck me in the Joy. You can't employ me, can you? [ Laughing ]
I can't even employee myself! -It's Tara.
-Yeah. I'm too stoned. TARA: Vincent, I'm moving
for a hearing this afternoon. I need you to front it up.
Call me. Get me a bucket of ice. Of course Judge Redmond
was half asleep, as I was. Oh, you do make me laugh. You're ridiculous. Caroline. Tara. Can I borrow him for a bit? He's all yours. I've been thinking about us
working together again... ...remembering how it was
I felt about you. Same here. It's kind of caught me
off guard, you know, just how sensitive you've been about the whole
Corrine-and-Julie situation. I have to say, it's been making
life difficult for me, seeing you that way. And then I looked through this. Julie always said
that the trust never got signed because things became
overwrought at that meeting. I think you and I both know
why that was. Because it was at that meeting
that Julie discovered that Barry was married. And who was at that meeting? Your father -- R.W.D. Which means that he knew
about Barry having two wives. What of it? He wasn't Julie's
wedding planner. Setting up a trust for
a second wife in full knowledge. What did you think
the Law Society were gonna say? Eric, your father is an officer
of the court. He's not protected
by client privilege. He could also be considered
to have aided and abetted his "valued client" Barry in fraud and bigamy
and whatever else. Your Mr. Big Heart act was
just about keeping things calm so your father didn't get hurt. You gonna use this? I need you to consent
to short service and an immediate hearing for a
direction on Barry's treatment. You're gonna have some battle
against us and the hospital. Maybe. But it's all that we have
to try and save a man's life. Not going great, huh? Oh, I-I have affidavits
to prepare, I've got other people's
affidavits raining in, I'm before a judge this evening,
I can't get Vincent, and I sacked Ray. I told you he was unemployable. Hey, you tried. This -- This sofa bed!
I-I just -- I can't get it to... I'm just a bit overwhelmed. You know it's gonna work out. Come on.
Get up. -Come on.
-Oh. Oh. Let me -- Let me -- Let me help.
Let me help. You're not gonna be able to
do it because it doesn't work. -Give us a minute.
-It will not fold over. It will fold. Oh, that was --
that was a bit of luck. See? I told you it was --
It's easy. You just have to fold it in. -PETE: Ta-da.
-TARA: Nice. I'm good
at the cushion arranging. -You're -- [ Laughs ]
-That is what I am good at. -Give me that.
-[ Laughs ] Cavalry's here. Oh.
Thank goodness. Pete. -Thanks, Pete.
-Yeah. Uh, what time is the hearing? -5:00.
-Mm. Well, we're walking
into a shit storm, but we'll go down fighting. Affidavits? Yes.
I have plenty. RAY: Barry and Corrine fight
like cats and dogs whenever they're together. That's why Barry's traveling
all the time. And Finbar said
when his dad's away, his mum is out most nights --
all night. Yeah.
A bit on the side. Have you told Tara? She sacked me, remember? Anyway, I-I figured if you were
gonna be using foul means, she's best not knowing. -You have a good memory.
-Almost photogenic. Uh, this is Corrine's
mobile number, home address, e-mail address, and car reg. Can I leave it with you? Yep. Coffee is awful, by the way. Ah. Nuala. -Vincent.
-Thanks for making it. -No bother.
-Shall we? Yeah. DR. LEVINS: ...taking into
consideration the poor match and other factors and the high chance
the available liver will be rejected anyway. But his son's liver
would not be rejected? There's less chance Finbar's
liver would be rejected. But it's questionable now in the light of Mr. O'Brien's
ever-worsening condition, whether he'd survive
the operation. Can you tell us how the decision
to allow Mr. O'Brien to die -- ...uh, to not make
further interventions was taken? It was a medical decision with reference to the legal team
in the hospital and also taking
into consideration the views and feelings
of Mr. O'Brien's wife. Her stated view that, uh, if
a circumstance like this arose, Mr. O'Brien
would not want heroics nor the risk
of becoming a vegetable but would rather go out
with a bang? Yes. And if Corrine O'Brien
had supported her son's wish to donate his liver,
you would operate? This is hypothetical, as Finbar
is not available as a donor. But let me say
it would not be without risk for Finbar to donate. The liver is a vascular organ. There'd be a great deal
of bleeding, transfusions,
the risk he may bleed out, infections, clots in the leg,
pneumonia. We collapse the lungs
during the operation. Chronic pain,
not without risk, sir. So when you took
into consideration the views and feelings
of Corrine O'Brien, did you also take
into consideration the fact that Corrine O'Brien
was angry with her husband, had just found out he had
two children by another woman? Mr. Pike. Uh, sorry, Judge. I have a medical expert
to call -- Mrs. Nuala Phipps. No.
I don't believe it. Ray, can you get to Roycoft's
in Bride Street? In 15 minutes? Then run. NUALA: As the liver donation
is elective surgery performed in controlled
conditions, I would characterize the risks
as very low, particularly when measured
against the fact that you would be saving
another person's life. But you have not seen
Mr. O'Brien in the flesh? I've read all of his notes. Not seen his color
or taken his pulse? There hasn't been the time. Have you any other questions
for Mrs. Phipps, Mr. Pike? No, Judge.
Thank you. I would like to know
whether it's intended to hear the evidence
of Mrs. Corrine O'Brien. As I see it,
that's a matter for Mrs. O'Brien and her legal advisers. Do you have
any further witnesses you would like to call,
Mr. Pike? No, Judge, but I am anxious
to have the opportunity to cross-examine Mrs. O'Brien
on the content of her affidavit. Frankly, I think that justice
in this case requires it. What's your client's attitude
to this request? JUDGE CAHILL: It appears
your request has been granted, Mr. Pike. We'll hear from
Mrs. Corrine O'Brien. I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Mrs. O'Brien,
we have no questions. But you might answer
any questions my friend may have for you. VINCENT: Corrine,
we've heard that your feelings affected the decision
of Mr. Levins to make no further efforts
to save your husband's life. You swore an affidavit
for the hospital which says that Barry
would choose to die if such a circumstance arose. Did it make you angry to find out he had another wife
and two bonny children? It didn't stop me loving him. Credit to you. And your support
for the no-heroics policy was not affected by the thought
that should he survive, he might make proper provision
for Julie and their children -- his children? Not affected by that, no. VINCENT: And your decision
was not affected by the fact that should you allow him
to live, he might leave you and legitimately marry
Julie O'Brien? The thought never crossed
my mind, because that would never happen. Corrine, Ivan Camier --
That name mean anything to you? Do you know him? I'm sorry, Judge, but
no evidence has been presented in relation to this. There's the DVD, and there's
the stills from the CCTV. Uh, Mr. Pike, what on earth
is going on here? Uh, new evidence
has been presented to me. Uh, in the context of this being
a life-and-death matter I -- We have a DVD to play
for the court, please. VINCENT:
Acknowledging in the fact that it's not on affidavit
and out of sequence -- This is completely unacceptable and not properly
before the court. We are not on notice. Where did you get this photo? Have you been stalking me? Mrs. O'Brien, you accept that you are the woman
in these photographs? No. Well... Yeah. JUDGE CAHILL:
I wish to hear this. Proceed, Mr. Pike. These photos were taken
from CCTV this afternoon at 3:30 in Leslie Roycroft Jewelers. We have the CCTV ready to play
here now for the court. And if necessary, we can arrange
for Mr. Roycroft to attend and give evidence for himself. Corrine...do you know the man
in this photo? Uh...yeah. I think he works for my husband. He's a business associate
of my husband's. Does he mean anything to you
on a personal level? You're under oath and required
to answer questions. I know him.
So? So you were in the shop
together. If we might roll the film,
Judge? And there we see
Corrine O'Brien, clearly not awash with grief,
trying on rings with Mr. Camier. That doesn't prove anything.
I was just -- You and Mr. Camier were ordering
wedding rings, weren't you? That's rubbish.
I was only -- Having chosen the style
and size, you instructed Mr. Roycroft
to make the rings in white and yellow gold,
twisted, with "Ivan forever"
engraved in the smaller and "Corrine forever"
engraved in the larger. And for the avoidance of doubt, you even wrote the exact wording
and spelling for Mr. Roycroft. Isn't that right? Your motives regarding your
husband's health are malign, malicious, and self-serving. Your affidavit and your
intentions are not bona fide. Mrs. O'Brien, can you confirm
that you are indeed the woman in these stills
and also on the CCTV footage? Yes. JUDGE CAHILL:
Have you anything to say? No. Step down, please. Young man. Have you heard
the risks you might run were you to be allowed to donate
part of your liver? Yeah. What might they be? Uh, bleeding out, pneumonia,
um, clots and stuff. Knowing those risks
and that the operation might even then not save
your father's life, why would you be prepared
to take such risk? Well, I want to help my da. You know, and if, uh,
if giving part of my liver means I can...
can do that, then... Well, whatever he's got going on
with, uh, with -- with work and all the other stuff, he's... he's still the only dad
who was there at the ground
every pissy Wednesday, you know, shouting his lungs out
while I'm playing football. And, uh... I feel like I'm just getting
to know him. And it seems like I've got
a new brother and sister, so...I want Da to introduce me. I see no legal impediment to you
consenting to this procedure. Therefore, I dictate that the
hospital carry out the donation in line with Finbar's wishes. I wish you well, young man. Thank you. Meg, how did you that? It wasn't me.
It was Ray. Ray. Sorry, Tara. I'm sorry. And thank you. Oh, if I breathalyzed you
right now. And the rest.
How does he do it? [ Chuckles ]
I owe you all dinner. Yeah -- and a couple of grand. -Ditto.
-And severance pay. You can forget that. WOMAN:
Excuse me, Doctor. Could you sign a release for me,
please? Hiya, Tara. Oh, Tara. Julie. Finbar, how are you doing? I'm grand.
I'm grand. Yeah. BARRY:
So you're the one? Thanks for coming. You're looking a bit better than the last time I saw you,
Mr. O'Brien. You're famous, Rafferty. Thank you. Any news on Corrine? She's in Spain. And Ivan Camier? Somewhere hotter. Well, thanks for this. Wait. Hang on a second.
This is -- -This is way more than --
-BARRY: You helped save my life. That's what I owe you. TARA: He's the one
who saved your life. I know that.
He'll get his due. Now, I want your little firm
to act for me from now on. Well, um, thank you. But, um, I think we're gonna
mostly focus on family law, so... We're a family. I'll leave you to eat your food. Bye, Julie. Bye. We've been paid! Who is this?
Barry, was it? -Yeah.
-Hey, I've got wine. Nice.
