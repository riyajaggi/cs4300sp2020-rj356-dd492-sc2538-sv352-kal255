Eric. He can wait. Nigel, it's Eric. Listen, the inquiry won't be on hold for long, and once it's back, Robert Moroney's evidence puts you right in the crosshairs. We need to speak. You think I'll take the blame for this so you can just slip away? You gave us your instructions, and now we are giving you ours. "Ours"? You're not bossing your lad about now, Richard. [ Door closes ] RICHARD: We've all discussed it, Nigel. And here's what's going to happen. {\an8}♪ Is this what love looks like? ♪ {\an8}♪ It is breaking down ♪ {\an8}♪ Turns on itself ♪ {\an8}♪ Melts the flesh from the bone ♪ ♪ Oceans empty drop by drop by drop ♪ ♪ No shock and awe ♪ {\an8}♪ Slow and steady she goes ♪ {\an8}♪ No Jesus, no wrecking ball ♪ [ Down-tempo music plays ] No. Your client is playing games, and I'm not having it. I want a sensible, reasonable offer by close of business today or I'm seeking my costs. Well, that is your problem, isn't it? That's a good start. All this time chasing a settlement, and they're trying to pull a fast one. Well, I think he got the message. She. Doing the all-girls-together act then trying to screw my client for a fortune. He. She. Whatever. You got out of the wrong side of the bed. It's hard to tell. It wasn't mine. Well, if I was the kind of woman who ever dreamed of calling herself a girl, let alone living an all-girls-together kind of life, I might be tempted to ask whose bed it was. But I'm not. And right now I have an appointment with an ombudsman about some notebooks. The notebooks in Ray's case? The very ones. Let's see what they have for us. Good luck. [ Door opens ] [ Mid-tempo music plays ] [ Whistles ] Plans? -Affidavits. -[ Laughs ] You are all work. Not the papers. Plans. Tonight? Uh, no. Sorry. Busy. Another night? Oh. Well, as long as you have a good reason, how could I be offended? Nothing better to do than to hang out with me? Yeah. Losing your touch, are you? She's just busy. Well, I have a few things to sort. Things? Things I tried to sort last night before Tara blew up at me in a restaurant. -Tara? -Yeah. Upset about the inquiry, blaming me for everything. All I needed. -Oh, yeah. Who were you with? -[ Telephone rings ] -[ Intercom beeps ] -Hello? LUCY: Hello, Mr. Dunbar. How very lovely to hear your voi-- Hey, Lucy. How are you doing? I'm fine. Thank you very much for asking. You have a special client coming in to see you. -When are they coming to see me? -About... Eric. -...now. -Thank you, Lucy. For a very calm man, you know some very angry women. -Corrine, how are you? -Raging. -And you are? -Leaving. I'll, uh, I'll see you later. [ Ice cubes rattling ] Right. Fantastic. Corrine, how's Finbar? -Suffering. -Oh? Problems after his operation? Problems with his father. Right. I want a legal separation from Barry, and I want a financial settlement that'll make his eyes water. Okay. Two wives, two lives. And the big shite thinks he's not paying for it? Well, as far as I remember, there were issues with you and Barry, Corrine, which, given the unconventional nature -- He's a bigamist. But he's not been prosecuted for it, and there's a danger if you push too far -- He might try and scare me off like he scared off Ivan. Ivan. He's the... Ivan was the man. And now, because of Barry, he's not anymore. Right. This could get tricky. He married twice. He's taken a chunk out of my son's liver. And I know all his secrets. You're supposed to be a solicitor, so make it happen. And do it before the tax man, the guards, and some other bloody wife comes crawling out from under a stone. And make me an appointment for tomorrow. We've got work to do. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Mid-tempo music plays ] [ Siren wailing ] You've got 15 minutes, Ms. Cusack. Fifteen? I need more than 15. Nobody will know Mr. Fitzjames and my other guests were here, will they, Lucy? No, Mr. Dunbar. Absolutely nobody. Absolutely nobody. Good. Last night, the restaurant. Yeah? Public displays -- not good. That's a big caffeine habit. What are you doing here? I missed you. So you staked out my favorite coffee place? Should I be flattered? I was when you turned up at my door. Yeah. I was -- I was flattered. Well, I'm glad to hear it. But...I don't know. Maybe we should be a little less public. Two friends just bumping into each other in a coffee shop? [ Laughing ] Come on. What could be more innocent? -You know what I mean. -I know what you mean. It's just a little bit confused since I... If it makes you feel any better, you're not the only one who's confused. Okay. I'm confused because of the argument you just had in the restaurant with Eric. That would have ruined most people's night, but... but not you. You weren't a rebound thing. Weren't. Aren't. Present tense. Okay. -He probably had it coming. -Yeah. So we're okay? Yeah. -May I hug you now? -Yeah. Okay. -Bye. -Bye. [ Chuckles ] Have a good day. [ Dog barking, vehicles passing ] [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Diploma in legal studies. The beginning, I hope -- and I'm sure you do, too -- of an amazing journey. Now, if you could open your books to page 30... [ Door closes ] Morning. She comes bearing gifts. Any luck with the notebooks? See for yourself. You photographed them. Nobody said I couldn't. -Anything useful? -Not a lot. But there were three numbers written in the back cover -- you know, where people think they can scribble their secrets? -Numbers? -Mobiles. It was a takeaway, a cab company, and a Superintendent Wade. Which one do you reckon we should follow up? Who's Wade? Well, that's the next step. Brilliant, George. Now we're really getting somewhere. I was looking for Tara Rafferty. Right. -Mr. O'Brien. -Do we know each other? No. Just by reputation. TARA: Barry. Tara. Good to see you. Good to see you. Have you met George? George Cusack. Nice to meet you. Coffee? Advice. Can't drink coffee yet, you know? Oh. Of course. Tea with advice? It's free. Well, the tea is anyway. Come on. -Do you have any green tea? -I don't have any green tea. Good. I'll have a builder's, then. Three sugars. What's up? Someone's coming after me. Extradition? What, for a bit of bigamy? Nah. Nobody would be bothered with that. I've got a man out in Mexico, where we got married. Sorts things. I thought Dunbar's sorted your things. They did. And like I said to you a while back, now they don't. You do. Okay. What's going on? Corrine. She's coming after you? After me money, yeah. She wants a split. Barry, there's certain things that we can fight, but Corrine wanting a split might not be one of them. I know that. The separation isn't the problem. How much does she want? Oh, you know her. -You got the papers? -Not yet, no. She only saw a solicitor last night. A rematch -- you and Eric Dunbar. You did him once. Now do him again. How do you know she's been to see Mr. Dunbar? Knowing things is what I do. Mm. Morning, guys. How have you been doing, Finbar? Uh, yeah. Fine, thanks. Doctor says the liver's working well. You are not fine. But the doctors say... The doctors deal with the medical. We're here to deal with the legal. Okay. So Barry has proposed -- I want to screw him into the floor, him and that tart. Julie? Mrs. Living off the Fruits of My Hard Work. That's who she is. Bitch. Well, you've not yet been living apart for two years, so a quick, no-fault solution might be tricky. He's got a gym in Carrickmines. -Ma. -Shut up, Finbar. It's where he bases his operations. Tell him I was asking after it. Okay. Sorry. That's relevant to the settlement discussion because? He really doesn't want that being delved into. Think of it as a negotiating device. Right. And if he objects, tell him there'll be a lot more delving, too. [ Down-tempo music plays ] She'll go after the gym. Right. And is that your only business interest these days? It is in this country. When you say gym, we're not talking about a few rowing machines and a sit-up bench, are we? You're savvy, Tara. I like that. You see the wider picture, and I do not want that wider picture looked into. Understood? Mm. She'll come after Julie, too. I take it they haven't seen each other since. Since Corrine alleged that I had her bet on the side sidelined? No. And best left that way. Look, she likes to threaten. Lots of noise, because that's her way. But it's not helpful. What's bad for me is bad for her, and you need to explain that, okay? Mm-hmm. Good. VINCENT: I'm so bored. [ Mid-tempo music plays ] Ooh. Oh. Oh! You really need something to do. I know. I know. Ah! Mercifully, tonight, I have a spot of missionary work to do. Goodbye, Bookworm. [ Cellphone ringing ] Hello? What do you want? Yeah, I know the place. [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Mr. Fitzjames. I have not heard a word from him, Mr. Dunbar, but when I do, you'll be the first to know. Lucky Mr. Fitzjames. Right. I've got Mrs. O'Brien to deal with. Lucky Mrs. O'Brien. RICHARD: Ah! Eric! Yeah. Corrine O'Brien. Yeah. I'm meeting her later. -She wants a settlement. -I'm sure she does. How did we get left with her and lose the husband? I don't know. Bigamy, a liver, chaos. -Don't let her get too noisy. -Some hope. Also, the adjournment, the Tara Rafferty complaint. Yeah? It brings too much attention to our internal workings. Right, but you -- I thought she'd worked on the Fitzjames file, but in hindsight, I think I was wrong. So you want me to do what? Withdraw it. Just like that? Oh, I think it'll be fine. What about Fitzjames? The security guard leaves him in the frame on his own. I know. Pity. [ Indistinct conversations ] Corrine. How lovely to see you. I wish I could say the same. -Madam, would you -- -She's not staying. You had something to say. I know why you're going after the money. In your place, so would I. You are in my place. You want your day in court, telling Barry some whole truths, and I understand that. But it's...unhelpful. It'll draw unwanted attention. Well, hasn't little Miss Mouse changed? Living with Barry does that to a person, doesn't it? Why should I care if you get unwanted attention? Look, Corrine. You do something that takes the money away from Barry and it's taken away from you as well. I know about the gym. I know what he operates from there. And 50% of nothing is still nothing. I lost Barry. And he made sure I lost Ivan, too. I am sorry about that, Corrine. I am. But it doesn't change things, so...keep it subtle. Keep it calm. I don't have to shout, but I need him to listen... without interruptions. So do it. Say your piece, just not in court. Be discreet for once. MEG: You called? I need your expertise. Phone records. What about them? Well, before I explain, I want to be fair and frank and upfront and all that crap. All right. I've heard things. But I'm trusting you, so they don't count with me. I'm glad to hear it. But understand this -- Ray Lamont is my client, and I fight for my clients and with anyone who tries to hurt them. With Ray, we're on the same side. So put your teeth away. I really don't think that's a good idea, Corrine. There's more than one way to fight a battle. Uh-huh. Please sit. The Kray twins had a signature move. If you crossed them, they'd call you into the pub for a chat. And then you were in real trouble? When you got there, they offered you a cigarette sticking out the top of a packet. And when you leant in to take it with your teeth, they'd hit you, breaking your jaw. Then everyone else in the pub got the message. You see, sometimes all you need is the right place to send out the message. And then everything gets settled quietly. But without the violence, right? [ Indistinct conversations ] Good evening, everybody. I'm delighted that for this, our first lecture on ethics, we have a very special guest, a good friend and colleague, who has agreed to go through a few rudimentary principles on ethics. If you'd be good enough to welcome Senior Counsel Mr. Vincent Pike. VINCENT: So, um, ethics. People will tell you that ethics is a complicated business, but it's not. It's little more than doing the right thing at the right time. Hey. Ray! What's the matter? You're laughing. Why are you laughing? Believe me, I'd be perfectly fine without you. Okay. If there's anything you need... A pint maybe. [ Laughs ] Of course I'll get you a pint! [ Laughs ] [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Indistinct conversations ] -Hey, Tara. Sorry. -Hi. Grab a pew. "Lots of things." You said we need to talk about "lots of things." You don't agree, after going at me in front of an entire restaurant? You deserved it. You're right. Things were said. They shouldn't have been. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said Dunbar's was your whole life. That was unfair. And Lucy. Let's not go there. The inquiry, Eric, you using me to get the adjournment -- That was low. The complaint's been withdrawn. Whose decision was that? You're giving me nothing? So the O'Briens. I'm sure you don't want a big, messy fight, especially not with Corrine in your corner. That would not be a good look for the Dunbars. And you don't want Barry dug into too deeply, because who knows what we'll find? And you're conflicted because Dunbar's used to represent him. But if we use what we know, it'll all explode, and that's the exact opposite of what we're both looking for. Okay. So we keep it very low-key, and we stop our clients indulging in any mutual destruction. You haven't heard, then? Look, in my defense, can I just say that Corrine O'Brien is not the easiest person to advise? [ Down-tempo music plays ] I'll pass that on. Thank you. Please tell me that's a smile of imminent good news. You could say that. Complaint withdrawn. We're back in business. Withdrawn? Why would they do that now? Precisely. Well, let's get on with it. Where were we? She says she's here because she wants to feel safe? She wants to be somewhere where you can't get her, apparently. We got married here. She's making a point. Negotiations are all about making points. She's trying to wind me up. So far, she hasn't said anything about the gym, and that's the way we want to keep it, don't we? Staying calm saves you money. Simple as that. Are you telling me what to do? I'm advising you. Mm. Just explain to me so I understand. Why here exactly? I told you. Just like the Kray twins, we're sending out a message. We got married here. He'll get it. Trust me. Come on. I'm paying you by the hour. [ Clears throat ] Now, you stay here, where you're...safe. I'll go and see how they respond to our offer. Go on, then, and get me a figure. And if he plays up, you know what buttons to press. She insisted on this place. This meant to calm things down, is it, all this theater? Let's just try and get out of here with our careers still intact, shall we? [ Mid-tempo music plays ] Watch this space. -What happened? -Let's just wait awhile. -What did they say? -They're gonna have a look. What's he doing now? We need to measure our response. We need to play hardball. It's important we keep a poker face. Don't let them see how we're feeling, how we might react. [ Music continues ] I'm instructing you to tell him where to stick it. Tell her, too. Is that the calm thing to do? You've given your advice. I've given my instructions. Do it. He stood here in this building and promised to love me, to honor me, to obey me, and he didn't. When he walked away from that marriage, everything changed. -I'm telling you that now. -Corrine. You do what I tell you. Do you hear me? It's a no. Twenty-five K. How far will he budge? Not an inch. I can't vouch for Corrine's response if she's not given some sort of concession. Don't threaten chaos, Eric. We agreed -- damage limitation. [ Whispering ] She's very strong-willed. -[ Sighs ] -[ Sighs ] I'll kill her. "Have your say," you said. No interruptions. That was the agreement. JULIE: So was being discreet. How did she know we were here? That woman knows bloody everything. -This is gonna kick off now. -Nothing's gonna kick off. Choosing here, of all places, to cause a scene and do your deal. Do you think about what you're doing ever, or do you just march in? You can talk about marching in. You think you can march in here and just direct everything? You'll end up with half of nothing, and all because you couldn't keep yourself in check. You'd like me quiet, wouldn't you? Sitting back and let you just come in here and organize everything to suit yourself! You had an agreement. I've got new instruction for you. Look sharp. -What are you doing here? -What the bloody hell? You had an agreement? With her? Look, I'm here to save him from himself, okay? I want you to calm down, trust me, and think of your health. What agreement? I want half of everything he's got. I don't care what it is. Now, go and get it. You're kidding me. There's no way I can go over -- Just go and deliver your message. [ Clears throat ] My client would like an affidavit detailing your client's means, including the gym. Eric. I have instructions. What can I do? She's going after the gym. [ Groans ] -Julie. -Have you no sense at all? -Julie. -None?! No sort of control? You can talk about control. Does this place mean nothing to you? Not the place, not the person. You took vows! My mother was right about you. You're a lowlife scumbag. The mouth on you! You're no more than a common thief. -I'm not having this. Come on. -You know all about common. She wants to start a war. -Is that it? -Barry, come on. Let's see who gets what out of that, shall we? You think I'm just gonna give up? You know me even less than I thought you did. Enough! Let me speak to Ms. Rafferty. [ Sighs ] Where to from here? [ Door closes ] Finbar. Hey. Finbar. [ Door opens ] [ Horn honks ] Finbar. You okay? Obviously not. I mean, that's -- that's my family in there, and they're... Well, you saw them. They're embarrassing. I bet your family don't act like that to each other. Hey, you know what you just said about them embarrassing themselves? Yeah. And I meant it. Do you want to change that? Change...Well, yeah. Of course I want to change it. What do you mean? Talk to your dad. I think you're the only one who can. Talk to him about what? Just tell him. Tell him exactly how you feel, Finbar. It might help. Yeah? Yeah. [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Indistinct conversations ] CONRAD: Tara. Hi, Tara. CONRAD: What a lovely surprise. Where are you two going? Well, it is a working day, Tara. I'm sure you have things to do as well. [ Chuckles ] How was Waterford? Good trip? I'll see you there. I'm sorry. I really don't know what you mean. But you do, don't you? I'm sorry. I've got to go. I'll -- I'll call you later. [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Birds chirping ] TARA: Come on up. [ Door closes ] I was just passing. But the thing is... The thing? Mm-hmm. I've not had a huge row with my brother. I'm not sure this is still a requirement, but should one of us have just bawled him out of it? He doesn't know, does he? What's it got to do with him? He's too busy with Lucy. Oh, I'm sorry. Should I play dumb, pretend it's a mystery woman there with him when you intervened in the meal? I like you when you're serious. Do you? Not very often, then. You are a bad person. Oh? [ Down-tempo music plays ] Is it very bad of me if I say that was a bit...polite? That wasn't. [ Chuckles ] So because I was an unannounced but very well-mannered visitor, I, uh, I brought my own ingredients -- completely random. What have we got here? Potatoes. Crazy...stuff and a very nice -- if I may say so myself -- bottle of wine. Oh, good, because I've got very high standards. So do I. That's why I brought this. BARRY: So what's up, son? Everything okay? [ Up-tempo music playing ] Over there. -I've had enough. -Enough of what exactly? Look. You were married twice. And I don't know what other secrets you might have had in all that time. Whatever. It's not the point. I understand Mum can be a handful, okay? No. You knew that when you married her. And I know -- I know Julie knows more than she lets on, all right? I'm not stupid. Secrets, whatever -- I can -- I can deal with that. That's life. That's always been our life. But the other day in City Hall, what was that? Getting up in each other's faces, screaming at each other? I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed of my own family. That hurts. Now...look. I gave you a part of me, and I'd do it again. I'd give you the whole thing if you needed it. But right now I need you to do something for me. I just want... I need to be proud of this family again. Of all of us. And if that means giving Mum whatever it is that she's looking for, just please do it. Just do it so this whole thing can go away. [ Mid-tempo music plays ] Nigel, I just have to ask if you need more time. It's okay, Eric. I'm ready. ERIC: Good morning. [ Door closes ] It is -- now we're up and running again. Indeed. Just letting you know Mr. Fitzjames is here ready to continue his evidence. Seconds out. [ Door closes ] Gentlemen. Mr. Fitzjames, if you'd like to look at this -- I'd like to make a statement. A statement? Yes. It's here. We've had no prior sight of this. Uh, I'm afraid neither have I. Please, Mr. Fitzjames...if you have something new to say, let's all hear it for the first time. "Having had time to consider my position, I would like to make certain things clear. In my earlier evidence, I denied any impropriety as regards to the Irish Oak consortium bid for the Leinster General Hospital. I now wish to correct that. I became aware that the late Mr. York was susceptible to financial inducement and took advantage of that. I was privy to other bids once they had been submitted, which allowed me to change the key details of mine, clearly to the financial benefit of my company. I've heard talk of conspiracies reaching far beyond my own standing. For the record, I have never acted with anyone but Mr. York. What was the nature of the financial inducement to Mr. York? My client would like to exercise the right not to self-incriminate. You could go to prison for this. Don't answer that question. FITZJAMES: For the record, I do not know personally any of the other people mentioned, nor have I acted on their behalf or in accordance with their instructions. I have nothing further to add. [ Down-tempo music plays ] -Nigel. -What? Who made you do that? There are people you go to war with and people you don't. Always know who's who. [ Door closes ] Eric. I was not expecting that. Neither was I. Do you think he did it by choice, of his own free will, seriously? Between us? No. Good. "The fallen one we leave behind." What? Nothing. Why good? Because if you still thought that any of this was legitimate... ...then I wouldn't feel the need to do this. To someone you know. [ Bell chimes ] [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Bell chimes ] [ Telephones ringing ] Have a word? In my office, please. Shut the door. [ Door closes ] What's wrong? Are you not sure about tonight? Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely sure. First, though, I need you to get visitors' logs for these dates, and I need you to do it very, very quietly, without letting anyone know what you're doing. You want me to do it? The whole lot. You'll have to go through them. And not a word to anyone? [ Cellphone buzzing ] Hey, Tara. [ Door opens ] You're joking. Where? [ Indistinct conversations ] What's going on, Barry? -It's sorted. -An agreement has been reached? It just needs to be rubber-stamped. And the gym? It's all his -- and its secrets. You're surrendering any claim to it? Like Barry said, an agreement has been reached. Right. So you'll be... Back to Spain, to Ivan. Ivan? Yeah. He's done his time. He can go back and be safe. S-So how did all of this... I did what you asked. I talked to him. Then other people started talking, and... Talking now, not shouting. And then they started to agree on some things. So if you could send those documents on, I'm back to the sun tonight. Listen. I'm glad we sorted it. We had some laughs, didn't we? I'll send Ivan your love. Come on, Finbar. We have Fitz. Next up, McGrath! Oh, come on, Bookworm. It's a party. They're falling like dominoes. One by one, all making life more difficult for the next. First blood and I'm gonna have to put you boys down already. Can you not enjoy yourselves before worrying about your next victim? -Come here, you. Come here! -[ Laughs ] Mwah! Back of the net. Hey. Hi! Your door's open. -Shit. -Yeah. You kissing my staff? I am, but not with my tongue. Little bit of tongue. VINCENT: [ Chuckles ] Here. Better have a drink. Thank you. -And some cheese. -Mmm. Where have you been, anyway? At the O'Briens', playing happy families. Both wives. -VINCENT: Never! -Yeah. Barry settled everything. Anything Corrine wants. Just needed it done. Bloody hell. How did that happen? I don't know. Just life. How's Finbar? He's good. Families and all who sail in them. Cheers! -Cheers! -Hey! There we are! [ Up-tempo music playing ] Hey, Lucy. I hope everything went okay with the visitors' logs. I'm here, so, uh, I'll see you soon. All right. [ Music continues ] All right. Hey! This place? Really? Yeah. What's wrong with it? Just seems a bit, you know... Look on the bright side. If someone shouts at you in here, nobody will blink. Really a very funny man. Sometimes I even smile. I'm happy for you. Pint? Or maybe cocktail list for sir? Pint, mard arse. [ Music continues ] [ Down-tempo music plays ] You found something already. Well, you were busy making big, angry speeches. I got on with finding some big, angry evidence. Anything we weren't expecting? Oh, you won't believe this. Wade contacted the two guards. He called them the afternoon Ray was arrested. Did he, now? Fitz didn't jump freely, did he? [ Down-tempo jazz playing ] It was meant to look like that, but I say he was pushed. Mm. Exactly. They want us to think we got him, call it quits, job done. You're gonna claim a far bigger prize. We are. We are because you're brilliant. I'm a bit of a mess, but I pick my fights carefully. And... ...I'm very proud... ...and glad to be your friend. Thank you. I'd better go. It's getting late. I'll see you out. [ Dog barking in distance ] -What a beautiful night. -Yes. My brilliant friend. [ Shutter clicks ] [ Shutter clicks ] See you tomorrow. Safe home and good night. [ Up-tempo music playing ] Hey. Am I that dull, really? Sorry, man. There's someone I wanted you to meet. She was supposed to join us. SAM: You okay? Yeah. Be right back. [ Cellphone rings ] Well, hello there. Hey. What are you up to? Oh, you know, just catching up with a...mate. Is that your best offer? Well, unless my luck dramatically changes in the next...10 seconds. If I was to leave at short notice, I'd like for you to know that this -- this friend, he won't hold it against me. Oh, good. Glad to hear it. Your call. I'll be at mine in 10 minutes. [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Indistinct conversations ] MAN: That's the one. MAN: Yeah. [ Indistinct conversations ] Hi. This is Lucy. I can't get to the phone right now. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Hi. Lucy. I got your message. Um...I don't really know what's going on, but... just call me when you can. [ Music continues ]
