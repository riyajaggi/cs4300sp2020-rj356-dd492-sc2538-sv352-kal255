Meg is working for your father. Now Ray is in jail.
Pete and I have been evicted. See? We just got the notice,
and now we're out. I'm gonna call a taxi and get
all this stuff picked up. - Let me take that.
- Thank you. Pete. I'm so sorry. Don't worry about me, babe. - Thank you, Steve.
- I just came to see how Ray is. He'll be dying in there.
You know that, don't you? I know. But look, we're doing
everything that we can. And we're gonna get him out,
okay, so don't worry. 
  subslikescript square adaptive  
 
 Okay. I was gonna ask if you needed a hand, but it looks like you're all right. See you later.
Babe. Eric. I know that this was your father. I know that he put pressure
on whoever owns this building to have us kicked out. - Prove it.
- Why don't you look into it? If you've got the stomach for it. I'll dig out the lease
and get it to you. Okay. Come on.
Let's get you sorted. Thanks. - You're off?
- Yeah. Pete, I can't do this
at the moment, and I'm sorry. Look. Look at me.
I'm bad luck. I don't care. Isn't gonna happen, and I'm sorry. Eric? No. Me. I'm sorry, Pete. {\an8}♪ Is this what love

- Where are you? I've been evicted. - What?
- Yep. And I'm on my way
to brief George Cusack for Ray's bail hearing. Yeah, of course.
How is the boy? Not very well, I'd imagine. You don't need me? No. No, thank you,
but not at this stage. Look, it's just one small bag of weed. I mean, they can't do him
for intent to supply, and he's not exactly a flight risk. No.
George will get him bail. - It'll be okay.
- Yeah. Okay, okay. Well, tell him to keep his chin up, and give George a big kiss
for me, will you? Good choice on your part. Let me know if you do need
my help, yeah? - Thank you, Vincent.
- Okay. How are you? - Yeah, uh, fine.
- Oh, good. Actually, Mum, do you know what? I'm a little bit up against it
at the moment. - Could you do me a favor?
- Of course. You know that Frank Keegan died? Yeah. And they're selling off all his
extant cases at the Law Society. Could you just say
that you're my employee and flash them
your old Four Courts pass and just sort through
anything that I might buy? Righto.
I'm on my way. I'm actually right beside them,
so it's perfect. Okay. Thanks, Mum. / WOMAN: Nigel Fitzjames'
evidence was adjourned, and once again the Pike inquiry seems to have ground to a halt. There is no official confirmation, but sources suggest
it's because of the news that a shed had burnt down on the an allotment on the northside, which may have contained documents relevant to the inquiry. TARA:
Okay, thank you so much, Meg. You know what to do. MEG:
Yeah, yeah. I do. Hi, this is Meg Riley. I may have a bit of news for you. Papers.
Piles of them. Green shed, northeast corner
of the allotment in Beech Park. - TARA: Five minutes?
- MAN: Okay. - I have these for you.
- Thank you. Excuse me.
George Cusack's office? - Yeah, straight ahead.
- Thank you. I've already pressed 65 buttons.
I want to speak to a human! ELECTRONIC VOICE: I'm sorry.
I didn't understand that. Oh, bog off. I'm sorry.
I didn't understand that. The door was open. Always is. Take a seat. Ray Lamont.
Bail hearing tomorrow. Yeah. Oh, George, you might want to
put that out. Vincent Pike sent you a kiss. Did he, now? Well, you know what you can
tell him to do with that. I've pushed the guards
for the charge sheet. Nothing so far. How well do you know
Mr. Lamont? Lucy, has Mr. Phillips
arrived yet? Not yet. Tara was just evicted from her office. - Really?
- Yeah. I was with her. Oh, good. Do you know who owns the lease
for that building? - MAN: Richard.
- Harold! To the minute.
I can set my watch by you. Lucy, I need any lease files that have been actioned
in the last two weeks, please. - Hi.
- There you go. Cheers. Oh. - Thanks.
- Thanks. AUCTIONEER:
To Butler, 2,000. Mum. I'm lining up two divorces
and a paternity for you. - Here we go.
- Mm-hmm. AUCTIONEER:
Case 11, Dwyer, divorce. -500.
-500. 800. Dunbar's don't do family law. Clearly they do now.
It's a payer. 1,000. - Mum, I...
- I brought my checkbook. -1,000.
-1,000. 1,200. 1,500. - Mum, look, I...
- MAN: Dunbar have 1,200. -1,500.
-1,800. Don't let Dunbar's bully you. Okay. 2,000. 2,500. AUCTIONEER: To Dunbar
and Calloway for 2,500. MAN: 2,500 to Dunbar. Case 24, Promise Obode,
immigration proceedings. 200. To Miss Rafferty for 200. WOMAN: Do you have any interest
in this one? Here's a few more. Are you writing a book? Feels like it. Mr. Fitzjames is here.
Will I send him in? - He's here now?
- Yeah. [ Groans ]
Give us a couple of minutes. MAN: 18,400. - Mum.
- I enjoyed that. Take your mind off Ray.
And you'll pay me back. I know you will. Thank you. - Hey. Tara.
- Hi. - That should keep you busy.
- Yeah. Entre nous, the Regulation of
Practise Committee may be calling you, to do with you employing someone convicted of fraud and drug dealing as your office manager. A few of these
need immediate attention. This woman is being deported next week. Okay.
I'll go see her now. Meg Riley here for you,
Mr. Dunbar. And I've rescheduled
your lunch meeting. Thank you, Lucy. Meg, how good to see you. I need a retainer. 15 hours a week at 80 euro an hour, on the books because I need
proof of income for my landlord. Plus expenses
when I'm actually working. - Ah.
- Mm. Entirely reasonable. And as it happens, I do have
a little project for you. After you. Thanks very much.
I'll be in touch, Nigel. - Cheers.
- Thanks. All right. [ Laughs ] Yeah! - Yeah!
- Yeah! TARA:
I've read through your file. You were arrested
for working illegally. And no immigration papers. All of the appeals are exhausted. I have written to the department, but I'm not hopeful it'll do any good. I am to be deported on Tuesday. Yeah. Well, if there's anything you need, or if I can help in any way... You cannot help. Right. Well, what will happen is that, um, some people will come to collect you, probably police,
and take you to prison, I'm afraid, in Dublin,
to wait until your flight. Until then you're free to leave
the center or whatever you like. Thank you.
You can leave now. You're Promise's
new solicitor, aren't you? Are you going to help her? I'm not at liberty
to discuss -- What, so you're not gonna help? Like the last solicitor. - I'm afraid I can't dis--
- Ah, sure, yeah. You just take the money and run. You're up in five. Miss Cusack, charge sheet. Finally. Oh, Ray. I'm so sorry. How are you? Not great. Where's Vincent? Vincent is a barrister.
I'm your solicitor -- George. - George will get you sorted.
- I'm not so sure. Herbal cannabis on a school
premises, intent to supply. I wasn't dealing. Theft of paint, possession of 56 tablets
of Ecstasy and 800 euros. What? Resisting arrest, assaulting
a guard, and criminal damage. Setup. Are you saying it's not true? Well, the paint and the weed. But the rest... You believe me, don't you? We don't have to. It's the judge that counts. I am refusing bail. Mr. Lamont is to be
remanded in custody. Next. We will get you out. Gentlemen. Thank you. I hope it was useful for you too. Hey. Who are they? Detectives looking into
the shed fiasco. Do they know who did it? Mm. If they do,
they're not telling me. Listen, I'm sorry to hear about Ray. Yeah. Count me in for the appeal, huh? - We'll get him out.
- Thank you, Vincent. I'm sure George will be delighted. Oh. I'll leave you to deal
with Little Lord Fauntleroy. Thanks for coming over. So here's the lease documents. By the way, Meg was
at the office again. Really? God.
How did I read her so wrong? It doesn't necessarily mean anything. Eric. Dunbar's doing family law now? - Of course not.
- Ask Gillian. - I remember that feeling.
- Hmm? For me, it was chemistry homework. What exactly are you looking for? Um, the Stockholm Cafe.
It's a place over -- - It's where Tara's office is.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's not in leases.
It's in private securities. Maybe we should subpoena Deirdre York. WOMAN: Yeah.
Worth a try. Tara, subpoena Deirdre York? Sorry, Vincent. Look, if you've got stuff to do,
don't worry about the inquiry. I'm cognizant you are
currently officeless. You work away, and we're gonna sit back and let Fitzjames
and your ex sweat for a while. What did he want, anyway?
Eric. He's looking into whether his
father was behind our eviction. Is he indeed? Yep. Oh.
And Meg is working for Richard. Really? - Yeah.
-[ Sighs ] It's good, isn't it? Look, Vincent, if you're sure
you don't need me, there is someone I need to see. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't call Deirdre York. The guards are interviewing her.
She has lost her husband. Might look like harassment. - Talk to you later.
- Mm. Hang on. I own it. No, not exactly, but the major shareholding is
held in trust for your benefit. Here's the forfeiture closing. - Who did this?
- It's managed. - How do you know?
- I know things. - Who is it managed by?
- Who do you think? Hi, Mr. Dunbar. TARA: Thanks for agreeing
to see me, Daniel. So how did you and Promise meet? DANIEL: She was working
at the local petrol station. We went out a few times. I sensed I was falling for her, and I thought she felt the same way, so, long story short, I proposed. She seemed a bit afraid at first, but I just put that down to her not being sure about
how she felt about me. Then what? Well, then they asked for her
papers at the petrol station and she had none, so they arrested her. Said she was
an illegal economic migrant. - What happened then?
- She hasn't spoken to me since. I did hear from someone
at the direct provision center that she'd applied for asylum. Said there was a cult after her. She might be killed if she goes home. Do you believe her? She's afraid of something.
I know that. But the authorities didn't believe her. Or didn't care. Unfortunately, from what
I know of refugee appeals, it's a story that a lot of people use. The authorities don't give it
much credence. Do you know what Promise
was doing in Ireland for the 18 months before she
started working in the garage? She never spoke of it. I've no idea
why she suddenly shut me out. I've been trying to see her for months and whenever I can leave the farm. She won't see me. You've been going there for months? Yeah. I love her. And she loves me.
I know it. If we had have married, she
could have stayed, couldn't she? To be honest, I'm not sure it
would have made any difference. We would have had a chance. Look, I need to speak to her. If she can't stay, I'd go with her. Honest. Okay, let me try and talk to her. Thanks. MAN: Promise,
your solicitor is here. How did you come to be in Ireland? Did you arrange it yourself? Yes. Organized yourself a false passport, had yourself smuggled in? See, I was wondering if
maybe someone else was involved, arranged it for you. Someone you're afraid of. I came here on my own. Promise, please. This might be your last chance. Can you tell me what happened to you? I came here on my own. Really? I paid a man to bring me. He took everything I had. And I was put in a house to be used by men. I save a little money... ...from tips. Extra money some of the men
would give me. Are they still here,
the men who brought you here? I don't know. Is that why you never
told anybody the truth, because you were afraid? Afraid and ashamed. I didn't want Daniel to find out
who I was. Promise, that's not who you are. It's what's happened to you. Daniel is here. Sometimes I see him from the windows. I don't want you to go. But if you do go,
I want to go with you. Please just tell me what I did wrong. You did nothing wrong. Then why? - Any idea where my father is?
- None. Oh, Gillian? Are you setting up
a family law section here? [ Chuckles ]
Not a chance. You were bidding for family law
cases at Frank Keegan's sale. I bought loads of different
cases for Dunbar's. Including family law cases.
Who told you to do that? I would have thought you'd be pleased. Do I look pleased? We want to get married.
I want her to stay in Ireland. No, Danny.
It is better I go. I will only be trouble for you. One day you will wake up,
and you will be ashamed. No, I promise you
that I will always be proud and grateful to be with you. Mr. Romeo. I never knew.
[ Laughs ] Well? Look, I'm so sorry,
but you're not gonna be able to get married at such short notice. It would mean the
county registrar would need to waive the three-month
waiting period. And look, they might even see it
as a blatant attempt to just -- It'll help us. So we have to try. Will we do it?
Please? Yes. Okay. I'll call
the county registrar for you. Great. I'll get these over
to Vincent for Ray's appeal. Well, wish him luck.
There's not a lot to go on. - George?
- Mm-hmm? Would you consider
renting me half this space? No. You'd have scatter cushions and scented candles all over the shop. TARA: Fair enough. I did find one little thing
in Ray's file. - Yeah?
- It's odd. You know the two guards
who lifted him in Marino? Yeah. They were actually based on
the southside, miles from there. They were a long way
outside their manor to be picking up
a minor punter like Ray. Okay. Thanks. VINCENT: There'll be something
I can use to get him out. - Trust me.
-[ Cellphone chimes ] It's from Eric. He's just confirmed it was
his father who had us evicted, - Three Rock.
- Three Rock? They're the people
who terminated Pete's lease. They're owned by Dunbar's. Meg, hey.
How are you? MEG: Yeah, uh, great.
How can I help you? Um, I need your help with Ray. Oh?
How is he? He's not good.
He's been refused bail. The two guards who arrested him,
they were way out of their area. I want to know why and who sent them. Okay. I'll see what
I can find out. Thanks, Meg.
You're a star. Bye. You just told me she was
the one who got Ray busted, and she gave information
to Richard Dunbar that had you evicted,
and it's, "Bye." I just -- I want Ray out.
Okay? And she may be the only one
who can help me. Yes, she was giving
Richard information, but I don't think she would have
expected Ray to be arrested. I mean, she's no bleeding heart,
but I know she likes Ray. She wouldn't have expected to see the burning-shed stuff
all over the news. What's the shed
got to do with anything? She was at the allotment. She was the one who sent us
the e-mail tipping us off
about the papers in the shed. How do you know? Just I do, okay? Tara, how did she come to be there? - You didn't hear anything.
- Tara! Just concentrate
on getting Ray out, okay? Please? MAN:
You want me to waive the statutory
three-month notice period? Yeah. When Miss Obode here
is on the brink of deportation? Yeah. In fact, it is the immediacy
of that deportation that precipitates this hurry. Yeah. A marriage of convenience, then. No. We love each other. Mr. McCarthy,
we have been clearly told that our marriage
will in no way help me to be allowed to stay in this country. Our solicitor has advised us
against this wedding, as it may well ruin any chances
we have for staying together. That is not convenient. We wish to marry so that whatever seas
and continents divide us, we will still be a couple
in the eyes of the law. Is that not so? Yeah. That's about it. Have you ever thought
of a career in the law? Yes. Oh, hey, Meg. [ Laughs ]
Welcome back. - So, what are you doing now?
- Fashion police. Still working
as an undercover tramp, I see. Meg. Are you after something? Last week, two of your boys
arrested Ray Lamont in Marino, and I need to know who sent them. Now, you know very well how
tightly all that is monitored. Yeah. And you know very well
how many favors you owe me. So who are you most afraid of? Always pitied Karen. I mean, actually having to... ...live with you. Never liked her, though. Jealousy is a terrible curse, George, and so tragically futile in this case, as you and I can never be one. Yet tragic futility is
the thinking man's babe magnet. - GEORGE: Babe magnet.
- VINCENT: I rest my case. - GEORGE: [ Laughs ]
- Hi. Meg. Is Tara here? Well, she asked me to come
and meet you both. I have information on Ray's arrest. Uh, I'm George. Hi. - TARA: Meg. Hi.
- Hi. Sorry. I thought it'd be
a good idea for you to meet Meg. I should have checked. Don't mind me. It is just my office. So, what's the news? The two uniformed guards
were operating unofficially away from their district,
but there was no tip-off. How do you know? Nothing was logged, and they're not allowed
to take calls directly. They have to refer them. They failed to notify their dispatcher that they were going there, and no one at their station
dispatched them. So who did send them? I have no idea. But I'll continue to dig. Okay, thanks, Meg. MEG: See you. Nice to meet you. See? Yeah, that's something
we can work with. Why are those guards
so interested in Ray? Because I've irritated
the powers that be, and this is our punishment. They evict us from the cafe. They tap me on the shoulder and
say that I'm gonna get hauled in front of the Law Society committee for employing a drug dealer
and a fraudster. That's before we had even heard
of those charges, by the way. They destroy what's
probably vital evidence. I'm just not gonna let them
make puppets of all of us while they just sit behind
their closed doors with their cozy chats
and their back slapping and that sort of shit. You can put your desk over there. No scatter cushions. TARA: Thank you. Vincent has woven his magic. We have a bail hearing tomorrow
morning for Ray in the High. - No way.
- Mm-hmm. That is brilliant.
Good man, Vincent. [ Sniffs ] Oh!
Pink grapefruit and champagne. Oh, God.
What have I done? Why did you evict Tara? What do you mean? I've seen the lease, and you
sent Gillian to outbid her. I sent her to buy cases for this firm. Family law cases? - Now, Eric...
- Tell me. I want Tara back with you. It may do her no harm to find
it's a hard world out there. And remember, Eric, everything
I've done has been for you. Now, if you don't mind,
I have a meeting. Shelbourne, John. Damn it. The department has rejected
my request for a stay on Promise's deportation. Why don't you play a different game? Use the entitled ones you know
or even are related to. No point in being born
with a silver spoon if you're not going to
shove it up people's arses from time to time. Tara Rafferty. DANIEL:
Hi, uh, listen, the county registrar has agreed to waive the statutory waiting period, so, uh, we've booked the
registry office for tomorrow. Great. Listen, tell me, if the guards were to arrive
early to collect Promise... Well -- Well, that would
be difficult. Right, but am I right in thinking that if they don't know where we are
until after the ceremony... Okay, look,
If you intentionally evade -- - Have they seen us?
- PROMISE: I don't think so. Daniel? What -- What's that?
Sorry, uh, Miss Rafferty. - Uh, the signal is very bad.
- TARA: Daniel... DANIEL: I'm gonna
have to call you back. Oh, my God. I think my lovebirds are on the run. Silver spoon time. I have written to the department to ask them to exercise their powers to put a stay on the deportation. But they've passed. You're quite pally with the
bigwigs in there, aren't you? Tara, you know very well
that I can't help you. What you need
is a face-to-face. I happen to know that a certain person will be at a book launch
this evening in Temple Bar. 7:00. Just, for heaven's sake,
don't tell them I suggested it. Where in Temple Bar? I know that this is completely
inappropriate, Minister, but I sent you a letter
about a client of mine, Promise Obode, who is
at the point of deportation. Her previous lawyer
missed so many things -- he was dying at the time -- and I've just found out
that she was trafficked. You're right.
This is utterly inappropriate. But it's also inappropriate
for the state to let somebody down so grievously, someone who is almost certain
to be retrafficked on return to her home country. She's just at the point
of marrying an Irish citizen, and I've met them,
I've met them both -- This is neither the time nor the place. So... - Nice to see you.
- Yes. You too, Mark. Good to see you.
Yes. Isn't that Conrad Rafferty's daughter? So this is where you bring
your wife-to-be the night before our wedding day. Okay. This is where we will have the fridge. And here the cooker. And over there, the bedroom. What about the cows? Oh, they can come inside
to keep us warm in this permanent winter
you Irish call weather. I'll keep you warm. Come here. What? Mr. McCarthy asked about
a marriage of convenience. And? It is a good question. How can I know if I really
love you, truthfully, when you can give me
such a lovely home... ...safety, security, so much love? So? So it is convenient. How can I know how I really feel when I get so much from being with you? Well, I get so much
from being with you. I still know how I feel. Drink your coffee. Good afternoon, Judge. Mr. Pike. I wonder if I might ask for
the forbearance of the court. If this guard's colleague
might step out while I ask him a few questions. A young man's liberty is at stake. A couple of minutes only. Very well. Now, do you recall whether
it was you or your colleague who found the drugs
and the cash on Mr. Lamont? I did. And where on Mr. Lamont
did you find the drugs? In the inside pocket of his jacket. - And the cash?
- In his trousers. VINCENT:
And whose shirt was ripped? Mine. It's bagged up
back at the station. Ah, yes, the station.
On the southside. Yes. And Marino,
where the arrest took place, a good way away on the northside. So? Let's stick to the convention of you answering "yes" or "no,"
shall we? Yes. You and your colleague,
who eagerly awaits his chance to come in and mirror
all your answers... Mr. Pike. Judge. Do you recall who dispatched you so far from home on this errand
across the city? DUGGAN: No. VINCENT: Presumably,
that dispatch will appear on your station records. I don't know.
I don't remember. Then how did you know to go to Marino and find Mr. Lamont
with his little bag of cannabis, unless you have
second sight or hear voices? Somebody must have tipped you off. I don't know. And I note you don't demur when I say he was carrying
a little bag of cannabis. Because that's all
he was carrying, wasn't it? No.
He had cannabis, Ecstasy, cash. VINCENT: And he resisted arrest
and caused criminal damage. - DUGGAN: Yes.
- A major to-do. Yes. And yet you don't remember who
sent you on this epic journey. Presumably the station logs
will tell us. It wasn't logged, was it? Was it logged? I told you, I don't know. Mr. Pike,
he says he doesn't know. So do you know who sent you? Somebody did, didn't they? You're not a free agent
to go on little missions on your own account, arresting random citizens
such as my client, Mr. Lamont. Somebody must have sent you. Who? No comment. No comment? I think I've heard quite enough.
You may step down. Mr. Pike. Judge, the circumstances
surrounding my client's arrest are profoundly shocking,
quite possibly criminal. I suggest that not only should
the charges be dropped, but an inquiry should be made into the conduct of these guards, which may take many months. In the meantime, my client
will remain incarcerated while his tormentors walk free. For now, Mr. Lamont
represents no flight risk and is not at risk of reoffending. Well, that was lucky.
What an agreeable judge. How very dare you?
You know I was magnificent. Magnificent? You're too modest for your own good. Oh. Look. - Good to see you.
- You too, mate. Thank you.
Thank you all so much. I do have somewhere I have to be. - Well done.
- See ya. We're not gonna let this go.
Do you hear me? I have to head out, but Vincent
is going to take you home. Okay? Tara, you have to
tell me why Meg was... Yeah, I have to fly.
We will talk. Okay? Tara, you... I'll talk to you later, okay? Come on, Ray.
Let's get out of here. You must surely be desperate to dine at your favorite restaurant. Now, shall I book a table, or will we go
straight to the drive-through? Hey. Hey. -[ Sniffles ]
- It's all right, Ray. It's all right. We are gathered here today to join the two of you
in holy matrimony. Daniel, do you take Promise
to be your lawful wedded wife? I do. - WOMAN: Yay!
- Ohh! WOMAN: Oh, my God! TARA:
Ah! Congratulations. Thank you. - Congratulations!
- Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. - Miss Rafferty.
- Congratulations. - Thanks. Thanks very much.
- So happy for you. Promise Obode, I'm afraid I've
been directed to arrest you. Get your hands off my wife. - Danny.
- TARA: They're newlyweds! - Where are you taking her?
- Where are you taking her? OFFICER: Taking her
straight to Dublin Airport. TARA: Promise... It's okay, Promise.
I'll be right behind you. Promise, I'll be right behind you. Can they do this?
We just got married! - Promise...
-[ Cellphone rings ] I'll be right behind you, Promise. George? Tara, courier arrived.
Department of Justice letter. Yes, can you open it for me? - Reprieve. Temporary stay.
- Okay, grab the courier. Get him to go to the airport, and tell him to wait for me there. Can you hang on?
Hello? - RAY: Is this yours?
- VINCENT: Yeah. Yeah. It's a little less cramped
than the last place. I think you'll like it. Welcome to the new Château Vincent. This is your home now. For as long as you want. No arguments. Your room is up the stairs
and first on the left. Make yourself at home. Tea or bong? RAY: Tea, please. Tara Rafferty.
Do you have a letter for me? - Yes, this.
- Thank you. No problem. DANIEL: Promise! - Daniel. Danny, please.
- Promise. Wait. Stop. From the Department of Justice, granting a temporary stay
on the deportation order. Thank God. Pending a review from the minister. DANIEL:
Miss Rafferty. Tara. I can't thank you enough. It is only a stay.
We still can't guarantee that -- You've said that before.
Now look. There's always a way. Thank you, Tara, for listening to me. And for making me listen. I'll be in touch. Come on. Lucy, I was gonna grab a quick drink. Do you want to join? Dangerous. I'm meeting a friend at the airport. - We're heading to Vienna.
- Oh, really? I'm a slave to Mozart. You're kidding. - It's lovely.
- Thank you. I don't sing it.
I just listen to it. A lot of men think it's just shyness. The weak flow. But it's usually prostate. Ischuria. Be very careful, Richard Dunbar. Very careful, indeed. There are things not dealt with that can be fatal.
