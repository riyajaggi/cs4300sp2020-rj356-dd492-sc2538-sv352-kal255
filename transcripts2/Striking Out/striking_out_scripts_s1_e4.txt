-Where is he? -Oh, no. What are you doing?
-All right! -Sam? Hello.

Up we get. -Get away from me son. Sam!

Where are you taking him?! -Where's your warrant?
-Here's your warrant! Where are you taking him?
Sammy! Ah.
What's this? We didn't do anything wrong.
We didn't do anything wrong. MAN:
And whose is this? WOMAN:
Sam. We're gonna get him back.
We're gonna get him back. Don't worry.
We're gonna get him back. He's not going anywhere. ♪ Is this what love

to take in with me, please? MAN:
Sure, Tara. What's with the smile? Happiness. -You gonna say hello?
-Nope. You take me for granted? -Yeah.
-Okay. Thank you. You could make a case
that being taken for granted might just be the best thing
in the world. Um, someone called Eric was in
earlier looking for you. Thanks. MAN ON TELEVISION: And today
the Pike Commission of Inquiry into possible
bidding irregularities surrounding the new
Leinster General Hospital is setting up to hear witnesses. Among those being interviewed
later this week will be the former minister
of health, Philip McGrath, and Nigel Fitzjames,
the CEO of Irish Oak consortium, -who built the hospital.
-DEE: Ooh. Hello. -Hi!
-This is so funky. -Aw.
-Geez. Thank you! But, uh, Tara,
where are all the tissues? The tissues? I thought you were serious
about family law. There should be catering packs
of tissues on every surface. Remember what Vincent said? "Those of you who can't
get into Dunbar's will teach. And those of you
who can't teach..." "Will do family law." Well, that's me.
Can't teach. Can't do Dunbar's. -Ladies.
-Oh. Latte for madam. -Thank you.
-Mm-hmm. Macchiato double strength
for her only friend. Pete, this is Dee. -Hi.
-Hi. TARA:
Thanks. [ Whispering ]
Oh, my God. Tell me you're already carrying
his baby. What? But of course --
You don't like him that way. No comment. Seriously, I don't even know
if I'd know what to do anymore. It's been so long since I've
been with anyone else. It's like riding a bike. Oh, I hope it'd be better
than that. Hi, Dee. Hey, Ray.
How's it going? You left your brain at the flat. Oh, thank you. -Keep me posted.
-Stop it. Ray, do you remember
when I employed you, I said it would be
for two weeks? That was nearly six weeks ago. Yes, but I am indispensable. I know I've just had
a nice payday, but I don't know. This whole going-out-on-my-own
thing has been feast or famine. I just don't know if I can
pay you a regular salary. That's a relief. I thought you were sacking me
again. Am I not? No, 'cause I'll work
for nothing. You can sort me out
when you get the next payday. I have a new client for you.
They're friends of mine. I guess it'll be more legal aid. So not a feast as such --
more of a snack. So there were drugs in the flat? It was a party, like. And they just took Sammy away.
We want him back. Why don't the two of you go
and get a coffee, maybe some breakfast? I just need to have a quick chat
with Ray. Yeah.
Cheers. Social services don't just
take away people's children for no reason. Don't they? No, they don't. -Ray, look at them.
-They've had a terrible night. You're just judging them
for how they look. No, I'm not. But the court will. Look. I've known Johnny all my life. We've had the same journey
through care. He's a good heart,
and he's a good dad. If I was their friend,
I'd be taking them to someone with years of experience
in family law. That's not me. I'm just a corporate lawyer
gone walkabout. You will take them under,
won't you? Please, Tara. Fine. Go on. JOHN:
Brown sauce? -Yeah.
-Okay. Lads, she's gonna help you. Mrs. Rafferty. Oh, hello, uh... Ray. ...Ray. Tara is busy at the moment.
I'll tell her you're here. Thank you. I don't care if it's ex parte.
We'll be there anyway. Yes.
Be sure you do. Thank you. Right. There's an emergency
care order hearing listed for today at 4:00. We'll all go there together. Are you up to that? -Yeah. Thanks, Tara.
-Yeah. Thanks. Will Sam be there? No.
I'm sorry. Have they said where he is? No.
They won't tell us. -Hey, Mum.
-Oh. Just give me one moment. I'll see you there
at a quarter to 4:00, okay? And try and get some rest
before then. JOHN:
Yeah. I just dropped by. Yeah.
Thank you. There's a sale at Brown Thomas, and I thought
I might buy you lunch. Oh, that's lovely,
but I'm just a little bit busy. Why don't I drop in
in the next couple of days? -How's that?
-Lovely. Okay. -Lovely coffee. Thanks.
-Thanks. Oh.
Conrad. -Oh. Eric.
-How are you? -Good, thanks.
-And Irene? Fine, thank you. -Tara?
-Ditto. -Would you mind passing on --
-Must dash. Okay. VINCENT:
Come in. Yes. How can we help? My client, Mr. Fitzjames,
is called later this week. Yes. We wondered if we can get a day
and time. Thursday, Friday. Depends on the former minister
and other witnesses. He's a busy man. I'm sure. So am I. We were also wondering if someone had been briefing
the press about a probable line
of questioning. Were you, now? I thought your venerable father
was representing Mr. Fitzjames. Our firm is. And you're the office boy. Oof. Vincent has an agenda. Does she know? Rosie, show Mr. Dunbar Jr.
to the door. Don't open it.
Just show him. Let him try and work it out
for himself. -[ Door opens ]
-Ooh. Well done. Here we go. WOMAN: They are both known
to social services. There is a history
of drug abuse. Used syringes and needles
were found on the scene. The public health nurse reports
missed appointments for Sam and missed inoculations. The same also from Sam's doctor. His teachers, they report
lateness and absenteeism and frequent states
of distraction. There is also complaints
and reports from neighbors. It is our view, particularly in the context
of drug taking in the home, that there is a serious
and immediate risk to Sam's health and welfare and this situation
cannot be allowed to continue. Where is my son?
Where are you keeping him? Ms. Keogh, your son is in
a place of safety. He will remain there
for another seven days, when an interim care order
may be applied for. I will consider permitting
you both a supervised visit if I am persuaded that it is
in Sam's best interest. Meanwhile, I'm ordering
assessments on yourself, John Murphy, and on Sam. All of the relevant
documentation will be provided
to your solicitor, and you will have
ample opportunity to reply. Judge, I should like to apply
for a guardian ad litem under section 26 of the 1991 Act to make an independent
assessment of Sam's best interests. Agreed. That is all. RAY:
Here, Vinnie. Saw you on the telly. Raymond! Brought you a coffee. Why, thank you. And the purpose of this visit? Apart from craven adulation. Tara needs an income. And you need someone
shuffling papers and keeping you
on the straight and narrow. Fine point.
Well made. Someone's gonna get nailed
for his inquiry, aren't they? I doubt it. Surprise them.
Have you seen Fitzjames' yacht? Sadly, we can't throw someone
in jail because we don't like
their taste in toys. What is the world coming to? Come on.
Come meet the team. JOHN:
Heya. Hey, Lydia. Hey. How are you doing? Grand. Johnny, social services will be
coming to check this place out. Might be an idea to tidy up. You know, Ray is right. It's all about how they see you
as parents, how this place looks
as a home for Sam. He loves it...and us. Do you mind if I look around
the place? No. So you still find
whoopie cushions funny? -Yeah. [ Laughs ]
-That level of humor, yeah? That's a lovely painting
in there. Did you do it? Yeah. Don't forget you've got
your appointment with your social worker
this afternoon. Yeah. I've managed to postpone Lydia's
until Thursday, give her a bit more
time to prepare. WOMAN:
Come in, John. Take a seat. We are applying
for an interim care order. We need to know how you propose
to tackle your drug issues. We're suggesting
parenting classes. We also need to feel assured
that Sam will be at school, on time, properly turned out and that your flat
is also in good order. So, can you tell me
how it's come to this? All rise! I came to see Mum. She's playing golf. She may be some time. It's okay.
I'll wait. How is she? Well, not great. She doesn't have
the easiest time of it. How are you? I'm okay. Many years ago... when I was about the same age
as you are, come to think of it --
God. How odd is that? I was engaged. Then I met your mother...
at a party. I was smitten. And we fell in love. I broke off the engagement. Then...your mother became
pregnant, and we got married. Did you still think
about the other woman? I did. More as time went by, and...
Mum and I... I mean...
these things aren't binary. I still loved your mum and respected her and all that,
but... Did Mum know how you felt? Never spoken of. Not our style. A few years ago... ...I met the woman again. Siobhan. We had a brief affair. Mum found out --
hence my "no angel" tag. For me, it was decision time --
stay...or go. You were doing your finals
in college. I used that as my excuse
to stay. What happened to Siobhan? She...died. Bumped into Eric
the other day -- or vice versa. IRENE:
Hello, little family. Mum. Hey. Hey. Morning. Oh, God. What's wrong? The report
from John's assessment. He called the social worker
a bitch. Well, I'm sure
she's heard worse. Lydia's urine test was positive
for methadone. -Does she have a prescription?
-I don't think so. Ray, this is looking helpless. And John's was positive
for cannabis. Oh, God. But he did teach Sam how to swim
and whistle and do 20 keepy-uppies. It's more than anyone ever did
for John. -Right.
-Hey, Vinnie. -Hey.
-Hey. I need a solicitor
on the inquiry. Flexitime.
You're it. Any hours you like, and we'll work around
whatever you have on. Yeah.
Okay. I accept.
Thank you. -When do I start?
-Yesterday. Eric dropped by the other day. Did he? There's a pattern forming there. All right.
What have you got? VINCENT: If you work from here,
you'll never be short of coffee. Ah.
The ubiquitous peripatetic. -I'll call you later.
-Talk to you later. Do you have a moment? Pete. Hey. For what? Come into my office. Ray, can you give us a minute? Of course. Really nice. Has a feeling of...permanence. Yeah. Ms. Rafferty,
I need a good solicitor. Why? Have you been done
for stalking? Doorstepping my father, showing up here
for your coffees, Vincent's inquiry. Smacks of a little desperation. I was that the inquiry because
he's interviewing my client. You need to leave me alone. Why? You never said it was over. It's over. You're just saying that. This is crazy. We're great together.
You know that. No, I owe you, Eric. You know, if I hadn't caught you
with Caroline, I-I would never have
this office. I would never have got to know
Ray, got to know Meg. I was on such steady tracks
before, and I... ...I came off, and now I'm
having this long-overdue, necessary adventure. For your sanity and mine, just accept that there is
no going back. Love's not that easy
to switch off. You'll find someone else. Caroline, maybe. Oh, no, no, no. You looked like you were
really enjoying it. That wasn't the same thing. I want you back in my life...
in our bed. It isn't gonna happen. JOHN:
Lydia? Lyd? Come on. Come on, baby.
Come on. Come on. It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay. He's fine. LUCY:
Hello, Eric. I love your tie. Thanks. JOAN:
You saw her. I told you to keep away
for a while. I couldn't. I can't bear it. [ Voice breaking ]
I can't bear not being near her. I don't know what to do! RAY: They're well over the top
about these reports. Sam's doing all right. Integrates socially. Yeah, but there's lateness,
distraction, messy appearance. There it is again --
appearance. Oh, come on, Ray. If a teacher says that a kid
isn't dressed properly, isn't clean -- I know it's appearance,
but it's also important. And John scowling at everyone,
me included, isn't helping. To him, you're just like
all the rest -- privileged, powerful,
and patronizing. There is something
in these teachers' reports. It always mentions
that John is there, never Lydia. I am not impressed. I expected more from her. Just one idiotic infidelity. Yes. Imagine. Just one infidelity. Our son's bereft. His grandparents are alive. We're alive. We never even had any pets. Joan, where are you going
with this? Want me to buy him a dog? But he's never lost anything
before. It's destroying him. I won't have it, Richard. We have to do something. Ta-da! It looks great. -How is Sam? Do you know?
-Yeah. How is he? He's fine.
He's -- He's fine. What's this about? Could you both sit down, please?
I need to talk to you. Um, you're -- Yeah. No. He's fine to stay.
Go on. Lydia, do you have
a prescription for methadone? I think you've got one chance
to get Sam back. And that's if John applies
for sole custody. Sole custody? John, you need to find
a new home away from your present contacts. And, Lydia, I am so sorry, but you might only have limited
and supervised access to Sam. -Out. Out now.
-It's your only chance. You as well. She's a snotty bitch. I can represent you, but you don't stand a chance
together. It only hurts
'cause she's right. Think about it, Johnny. Sorry, Tara. She's his girl, you know? They've been together
their entire adult life. He takes it seriously. Thanks, Rosie. Happy in your work? This?
Yeah. The other business, it's so raw.
Family stuff. Anyway, I've just lost my
only clients, so I'm all yours. My gain. Oh. I thought you were Tara. What are you doing here? I was just thinking
of asking Tara to sublet some office space, get away from the kids
for a while. Um, she's at Vincent's inquiry. Weed's not good for you, kid. McGRATH: ...clearly a
politically motivated witch hunt set up by this new government. Then you should be comforted
by the fact that I have
no political affiliations or preconceptions, Mr. McGrath. -I'm sure, but,nonetheless --
-You've made your point. Now, some questions
if you wouldn't mind. You accepted a bid which was
clearly unfeasibly low. I acted on the recommendations
of Tim York, my head of procurement. Who, sadly,
is no longer with us. He was unwell and perhaps not
at the top of his game. He assured us the bid was sound, and I can categorically
assure you that the strict Irish and EU
protocols governing such matters were scrupulously adhered to. Hi. Hi. I left something for you
in your office, on your desk. Oh.
Something nice? I'm afraid not. Uh, landlords
have given me notice -- uh, breach of lease conditions, subletting space
without their permission. Oh, no. Okay. Well, I'll get onto it
straightaway. I knew you'd say that. Community service.
Only six hours to go. -Tara?
-Yeah? Can I cook you dinner? Oh.
Well, it's... No. Uh, at my place
when the cafe's closed. You and me. Uh, okay.
When? Tonight? No.
Actually, I have my Bible group. Oh.
Well, I mean, we can always... -Kidding.
-...do -- [ Laughs ] Well, I do know hardly anything
about you. I hardly know anything
about you. Friday? Friday. RAY: Tara?
I have someone here to see you. Hi, John. Look. I'll do it --
if you're sure it'll work. I can't guarantee that. The word I used was "chance." This way, we have a chance. Well, how big? A choice between a chance
and nothing. How am I meant to tell Lydia? What do I say to her? I mean, like,
how I'm abandoning her, how I'm betraying her? From what Ray has told me,
the last few years have been incredibly challenging
for you. I know you don't
want to hear it, but Lydia's addiction is putting
Sam's return to you in jeopardy. Can you do this for him? John, can you do this? Yeah. Okay. We've got four days to show them
you're a responsible father. We have to convince a judge. Ray? I have a few things
for you to do with John. We're gonna go to the ICO,
and we're gonna go prepared. We have to get you
some court-appropriate clothes. A job would look good. I'm calling it the favor. Um, he's a good worker, though. Uh, but he can only work
school hours -- 9:00 to 3:00. That works for us.
See you Monday. -Thanks a million.
-Cheers. See you Monday. Cheers, Ray. TARA:
And you'll also need a new home. Oh, this is so frustrating. I can't find anything
at short notice. -Are you looking for a flat?
-Yeah. I have one. I know.
I live there with you. No.
My other place. What, where we shared
in college? Yeah. Who is this for? It's just for a client of mine
and his little boy. They're going through a pretty
tough time at the moment. But it wouldn't be long term --
just somewhere for a few months until they find somewhere else
more permanent. Okay. Really? How'd you swing this? -It's Tara.
-[ Keys jingling ] Oh! What do you think? Yeah. Yeah.
Nice. And can be in back,
kick a ball and stuff. Also, I have to coach you. You have another assessment,
this time the guardian ad litem. So, Mr. Murphy,
have you always been a scumbag? Yeah.
Yeah, born and bred. Tell us about your jobs. I was an apprentice plumber,
and I worked for three years. Then you got sacked. Didn't get sacked, though,
did I? You do this right or Sam ends up having
the same shitty life we had and you see him once a month
till he's 18. I got laid off after the crash,
and there wasn't much work. And Sam's -- Sam's mother
was, like... Sam's mother was... ...unwell. Will that do? FITZJAMES: I promise to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Thank you for being here,
Mr. Fitzjames. I wonder -- Were you surprised
when your hastily assembled bid for the Leinster
General Hospital was successful? Not at all. Our consortium had
a proven track record, and ours was the best bid. It was the lowest bid
and was too low, as the 18 million overrun
would seem to indicate. Overruns are not unusual
in our business. Did you meet with the
then-minister, Philip McGrath, during the bidding process? Absolutely not. Hello from the real world. Hi. How's it going? Getting there. Take a look at this. It's a tip-off about the procurement man,
Timothy York. It's not signed, though. Do you think it's legit? Don't know. Says York kept records
of the bidding process. Well, can we try and find them? This inquiry has
no investigative powers. All I can do is ask questions. I'll make a copy of this. Rosie, can you get a transcript
of Fitzjames' testimony, please? Yeah. Uh, Meg? Any news on the leaseholders? Drawing a blank, I'm afraid. I'm sure Tara will -- Tara will what? Save the day. Meg, there's something else
I need you to look into for me. This guy Timothy York and some records
that maybe he was holding. He was the head of procurement
at the Ministry of Health. Just try and find the records
if you can. Speak to his widow,
anyone who knew him. But this is all unattributable
and off the record. Vincent can't know
that we're doing this. Hey, Ray. Tara. Did you have any luck finding
out who owns this building? Mm, the holding company is Three
Rock in the Cayman Islands, but the trail stops there. Are you fighting them? I've threatened the named
landlord with proceedings, but to be honest, I don't think
we have a hope in hell. The evidence of the breaches
of the lease are watertight. I'd like to know
how they found out. I'll keep probing
to find out who they are, and I'll try to find
your records. Ray. See you. See ya. Well, I...also tracked down
the company Three Rock and found out they are involved
in a litigation in New York and they're represented
by Klissman and Pfeiffer. Hang on.
I know them. They're US associates
of Dunbar and Calloway's. What does that mean? Means that Meg is off her game. Did Meg mention renting
some space in here for herself? No. There's not much point now
anyway, 'cause I'm gonna be moving on as
soon as I find somewhere else. WOMAN:
Can I get you anything? JOHN: No, thanks, Ms. Davis.
I'm not long after lunch. I saw Sam earlier. He's fine. Why don't you tell me about him? Sam is --
Little Sam is a diamond. -Hey.
-MEG: I think I found something. Hang on one sec. Okay.
Go for it. Tim York had a hobby.
He grew vegetables. And this is his hut,
all boarded up -- for a long while,
by the look of it. Mm.
Okay. Well, I didn't go in,
but I took a peek. There's a pile of books in there
and stacks of papers. Wow. Okay.
Thank you so much, Meg. You know what to do. Yeah, yeah.
I do. Hi.
This is Meg Riley. I may have a bit of news
for you. . -Hi.
-TARA: Vincent. I think we've found
the procurement guy's records. Well done, you. Yeah. Another anonymous tip-off.
E-mail this time. So, have you got anything
to do with this? No comment.
Vincent, listen. I was reading
Fitzjames' testimony. You might want to check out
a couple of phrases of his which are really similar
to the minister's, things like "strict Irish
and EU protocols" and "scrupulously adhered to." It's worth a look. Gotcha.
Thanks. And, uh, good luck
with your thing. Thanks. WOMAN: The best possible
outcome, Lydia, that we could even begin to
hope for in this situation is -- -Lydia. Please.
-It'll be okay. Will it? If it isn't, we'll have lost Sam
and each other. Here are the, uh,
guardian ad litem reports. Thank you. -[ Gavel taps ]
-WOMAN: All rise. Proceed. VINCENT: I just want to pick up
on something regarding the bidding process. And I quote -- "The strict Irish and EU
protocols governing such matters were scrupulously adhered to." That is what I said. An understandable error
on your part, Mr. Fitzjames. But actually, that's what
Minister McGrath said when he gave evidence. You said, "The whole process scrupulously adhered to strict
Irish and EU protocols." Your testimony and the
minister's are rather similar. Wouldn't you agree? I may have heard
the minister's evidence. You were not in this room
when he gave evidence. -No, but --
-And it was not made public until after you made
your statement to this hearing. Startlingly similar. There's no chance that you
and the minister, in breach of the rules
of this inquiry, discussed your testimony
in the run-up to this hearing? Of course not. And have you met with
the minister in recent months? We bump into each other
from time to time... in our charity work. But you never discussed
this hearing? Not to my knowledge. Really? It seems records
have been stored. -Vincent.
-The Gardaí, at this moment -- Look. Whatever was in the hut
has been destroyed. We will adjourn.
Matters have arisen. Thank you. Both respondents
were distressed. Both clearly with considerable
experience of social workers and how to manipulate them. Perhaps, but I'm
quite canny enough to know -- I see no mention in your report that either specifically asked
about Sam's condition. Well, they were under
considerable pressure and -- Did they ask? DAVIS:
No. Neither actually asked,
from what I recall. -That is a lie!
-WOMAN: Shh. -I did ask!
-That's enough. No further questions. Did you tell them how Sam was? Yes. So there was no need
for them to ask. No. In your assessment, you included a painting
that Sam did for you. It is clouds and a castle, surrounded by a forest
and a rainbow. Not unlike the picture painted
on Sam's bedroom wall at his home? Very similar. Painted by John. On page 11 of the report,
exhibit 5, you'll see another photograph of Mr. Murphy painting a similar
picture at his new flat. Having spoken to Mr. Murphy,
would you describe this as an attempt to manipulate
the authorities? I would say that it is
entirely genuine. The thoughtful and creative act
of a loving father? Yes. A father who took his son
to school every day and collected him. A father who was found lying
on his son's bedroom floor when the Gardaí raided, placing himself
in between what was happening at the rest of the flat
and his beloved child. A father who despite having
little experience of a stable
family life
when he was a child surrounded Sam with love
and protection. Yes. In circumstances that anyone
would find difficult. Yes. That is all. Judge, a motion has been issued
on behalf of my client, and I ask the court to give
Mr. Murphy custody of Sam, to live with him
at his new home, from which Ms. Keogh
will be absent. You can't do that! I'm his mother!
Please! Mr. Murphy has never stopped
loving Ms. Keogh. He has been with her through
all the years of her addictions, and he will be there for her
again once she's made a full recovery. And Sam will have
a loving father with him while they wait for her
to come back to them. Very well. John must have him. He must have Sam. JUDGE ANDREWS:
With liberty to apply in the event of any issues
arising, I order that John Murphy is the
primary carer with sole custody. Lydia Keogh will be allowed
supervised access for one hour per week, to be reviewed
in three months' time. WOMAN:
All rise. Tell him I love him. Course I will. Thank you.
Thanks. And you. Where's me boy? Let's get you to him.
Come on. Daddy! Buddy! Come here! -Missed you. Missed you.
-Bye, Ray! [ Laughs ]
See youse. Thanks so much. See ya. Let's go home to our house! Wait till you see
our new house. Sammy, say hello to Steve. Hi, Steve. Do you want a lift? I'm grand.
I'm just around the corner. -We'd better go.
-[ Engine starts ] Me final community service. Hey. So, how do you end up
on a houseboat? I had to put an ocean
between myself and someone. A lover? A gangster. A lover. What happened? I wanted children. She didn't. Deal-breaker. That's tough. Yeah. Anyway.
More champagne? Ray Lamont, we're arresting you
for theft. Theft? I'm doing my community service
here. Oh.
That's going to look lovely. Bag of weed
in a secondary school. You do not have to say anything
unless you wish to do so. But anything you do say may be given in evidence
in a court of law. Thank you. So, what are you cooking?
It smells amazing. Sea bass baked with lemongrass
and ginger. Fancy. God, Tara, you... -[ Cellphone ringing ]
-Oh. Let me turn it off. Sorry.
Just one second. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Hello? Ray. What? I'm on my way, okay? Pete, I'm so sorry.
I have to go. Ray has been arrested. Of course. I'm so sorry. I'll talk to you soon. I hope he's okay. Excuse me.
