Thank you, ladies. I think we did very well. -You did so well.

-Bye-bye, girls. -Bye!
-Bye! It was a lovely evening.
Enjoy the rest of it. TARA:
Oh, thank you.

I will be back in a minute. -That's my song.
-I know it's your song. -I love it.
-And you sing it so well. -Well, I --
-And so loud. So loud. Aw.
Those were the days. -Were they?
-Oh, God, yes. Your father and I, we couldn't
keep our hands off each other. Oh.
Rafferty -- Dalkey? MAN:
Yeah. A-And don't be
too late, darling. Eric won't like it
if you're late. I told him to stay
at his old flat. We might all end up
back at ours. And no kebabs. Good night.
[ Laughs ] -[ Engine revs ]
-I'm getting a kebab. Get out of here. Have fun. Good night!
Safe home! IRENE:
Goodbye! -MAN: You need a taxi?
-No, thanks. Yes.
Ballsbridge, please. MAN:
Okay. -Eight, two, four, eight.
-[ Keypad beeps, door clicks ] Oh, my God. WOMAN:
Not yet. [ Voice breaking ]
Oh, my God. Eric. What? What is this? Fuck. Eric. Y-You're having an affair. Are you having an affair? -Answer my question.
-Uh... Do you -- Do you --
Do you love each other? -No.
-Oh, leave me out of this. -No.
-This is between you two. Do you love her? C-Christ, no. What is it? This means absolutely nothing.
This is nothing! First and only time. First and only time. Then why? Because you've always wanted to
and this is your last chance? Sweetheart, now, please listen. Shut up! Do you have any idea

How was the hen? Big night, huh?
Eric called. He's on his way into work
and wondered if you were in yet. Can I help you? Yes. -WOMAN: Hi, Eric.
-ERIC: Hi, Lucy. Is Tara in yet? LUCY:
Um, yeah. She just was here. MAN:
Coffee? MAN:
Hey, Ray. RAY:
Pete. I'll be getting
a latte for the lady and the usual for me. RAY:
Yeah. All right. Why are you being so nice to me? Because in about 20 minutes, you're all that stands
between me and a summer break and the Joy. Oh, Christ. Um... Uh, Rory -- Rory, um,
breach of bail conditions. Ray. Breach of bail conditions --
allegedly. Nineteen minutes. Yes. Give me a minute. Eighteen minutes, so. ♪ As we begin ♪ ♪ Begin to end ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ We are nothing ♪ ♪ We are nothing, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ I know ♪ ♪ We are nothing ♪ ♪ We are nothing, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ I know ♪ -Ta, Pete.
-Yeah. Is that your brief? Yeah.
She's golden. Okay. Hey. Join you that way. Pete. Thank you. We're gonna need a cab. It's all taken care of. Okay. That's my, uh, file by the way. TARA:
Right. One fraud, one previous -- possession with intent
to supply. RAY:
They were diet supplements. But the fraud -- 28 grand.
That's a lot of money. -Ah. It adds up.
-Hey! Good luck, magic man. What's with the bag? My luggage in case you fail
and I go down. Two parts of tight pants,
a cork for the shower. That sort of thing. Three minutes and counting. So you were cashing
welfare checks for three years after this man... -Alan.
-...died. Well, it's complicated. There we are. Third on the list.
Come on. RAY:
I was always in care, and Alan was the only dad
I ever had. Got me back to school,
put my dinner on the table. Cashing the checks
kept him alive in a way. TARA:
Is this for me or for the judge? RAY:
Bit of both. WOMAN:
Go ahead, Ms. Riley. -What number is she on?
-What is it you want to show us? There. Mr. McColgan just asked
Ms. Fox out on a date tonight. Just because something
comes from your e-mail account doesn't prove that you sent it. We may need time
to consider our position. I'll adjourn.
17th of July. -Thank you, Ms. Riley.
-WOMAN: Number three. The state versus Raymond Lamont,
breach of bail conditions. A fraud of 28,663 euros and now a serious suggestion
of flight risk. Mr. Lamont came into the station with a passport photograph
to be signed. Ms. Rafferty? Wanting a passport doesn't prove
intent to travel, Judge. One might ask
what else a passport is for. I.D. Mr. L-- LAWYER:
Lamont? Mr. Lamont is very young-looking and instructs that he requires
such I.D. for entry into nightclubs
and such like. Judge, the original charges
are very serious. The application for a passport
is a worrying development, and we humbly ask for Mr. Lamont
to be remanded in custody. No fixed abode. No employment. Any changes there? He's just entering employment,
Judge. Continue station bail. Bring his pay slips
on the next occasion. Full hearing in a fortnight,
I see. I'm obliged, Judge. CLERK: Number four on the list.
The state versus Hoffman. I just told them
you were entering employment. I could be struck off for that. -I appreciate that.
-Tara, please. Get your stuff out of our house. I want to sleep there tonight. -Where'd you sleep last night?
-I didn't. -Darling, please talk to me.
-Let her go, man. Sorry. Thank you... -Pete.
-...Pete. Thanks for the coffee. No way. Should've got you
an espresso by the look of it. Pete, I have another favor
to ask you. I will give you 500 euro if you
employ Ray for a fortnight. No. [ Chuckles ]
Sorry. I can't do that. I mean, he's the nicest guy
in the world, but that kid's unemployable. Please.
Look. I-I've gotten myself
into a bit of a hole. I-I can't.
I'm sorry. You need a haircut. Vincent? Where are you? I tried Dunbar and Calloway's, and they're all a bit arch,
to be frank. I have a client for you. Um, Vincent, look.
I-I'm really sorry. -But I'm just not sure that --
-He's high-profile, Tara. And he urgently needs
a really good solicitor. Hang on. Um, Pete? You wouldn't have
somewhere quiet where I could have a chat
with someone, would you? Yeah.
Use my office. LUCY:
Can I help you, Mr. Dunbar? MAN:
Where is my son? Ah!
There you are. Where were you
and what's going on? I was down at the forecourts. We have the archdiocese here
in five minutes. Okay. Morning, Lucy, Fiona. -How are we?
-Morning, Mr. Dunbar. Mr. Pike, uh, come this way,
please. -WOMAN: See?
-MAN: Oh, it is him. Ms., uh, Rafferty
will see you now. Just give me a minute, Connor,
yeah? Sure. Tara, what's going on? Good question. Last night was my hen. I missed Eric,
so I went back to our, uh, flat. And... ...I caught him having sex
with Caroline Walsh. I thought Caroline had
better taste. [ Sighs ]
I'm sorry. Are you sure you're up for this? I could use the distraction,
actually. Well, in light
of what you just told me, I'm not entirely sure I
brought you the right customer. Oh, I gotcha. You're a man off the telly. In real life, you're not so... Tall? Orange. You and that bird off the news
are exceptionally orange. You look like you been tangled. VINCENT:
Connor? Ms. Rafferty will see you now,
Mr. Coughlan. It's pretty full on. Who are the two women? I don't know. Do you know who filmed it? Well, have --
have you upset someone? Someone who might be jealous? Is someone trying to hurt you
for some reason? Not that I can think of. Okay. Well, that little
teaser clip is what, maybe eight seconds? Presumably, the full film
they want to run tomorrow is a good deal longer. Um, I suppose so. But you're not sure? Well, s-surely you know where
this happened. Um, no.
I don't know. You see, I've had, um, a very
active and varied sexual life outside my marriage. You have a wife? Yes. And I can't think
what she's going to say. I have, um,
rather lost the run of myself. Okay. I'm gonna ask The World
to pull it down. And if they don't, we'll apply
for an interim injunction. Are you available? I'm tied up
with the inquiry all day. Get the paperwork together. If you get it listed
for a sitting this evening, I'll be there. And I'll try and get somebody
to track down the source. Um, maybe you should go
and speak to your wife. I'll let us know
what's going on. Come on, Connor.
Thanks, Tara. Thank you. Oh, Vincent? How is the inquiry going? Madness. I'm calling the minister
in a couple of weeks. I'll tell you,
I'm gonna tear the house down. Listen.
You take care. I'll talk to you later, yeah? It's fierce claustrophobic
in here. I'll have it sorted out for you
in a shake. I can't make this place
my office, Ray. I talked to Pete. He only uses it
about an hour a month. So as long as you need it,
it's yours. Look, I have to pop home. I need you to do a few things
for me. . . ERIC: Right. I'll have that
to you by the end of the week. -Thanks. Bye-bye.
-[ Telephone ringing ] It is the end of the week. -IRENE: Eric.
-Oh, fantastic. Irene, how are you? Where is Tara? We were meant to be meeting
for lunch to sort out the seating plans. She won't answer my calls,
my texts, my e-mails. Nobody here knows where she is, not even the girl
who was there last night at the hen do,
the one with the dark hair. She can't tell me. Am I to call the guards? Irene, uh...
[ Clears throat ] Irene... We've established my name, Eric. Well, yes. Um, last night,
I went to my old flat... ...with a woman. What? And...Tara found you? Understand me, Irene. I love Tara.
I'll do whatever it takes. It was a moment of idiocy,
a mad, mad last... Blast? You fool! You...absolute disgraceful fool. How could you do that
to my girl? And now she's gone walkabout? Well, actually, she came in
early to box up her things, and she was in court
this morning. Well, that'll be Tara. I want her back, Irene. You are a damned fool,
and you don't deserve her. This can be fixed. This will be fixed. That's great. And the I.T. woman? Found her. Meg Riley. She's on her way here. So is your photocopier, scanner,
printer, and a landline. Ray, do you want a job? I thought I already had one. Just for two weeks, mind. Cheers.
See you soon. I'll see you in 10. -Ray?
-RAY: In here! Wow. What is this place? It's an old metalworks factory. And now it's yours. Ray, I can't use
this place as my office. Yes, you can.
I'm fixing it up for you. Hi. Oh.
You'll be Meg. -I will if you'll be Mark.
-What? It's an obscure joke
based on a children's book. Oh. Sorry.
I'm not familiar with it. Thanks for coming
at such short notice. There's this, um, film clip. I've seen it.
Ray gave me the heads-up. Ah. Voilà.
There you go. Is there any chance
you could try and find the source of the film? It's just that our client
isn't being very helpful or forthcoming. -[ Telephone rings ]
-MAN: Hello. World Online. Hello. Can I have
your legal counsel, please? Sorry.
They're not here till Monday. Until Monday? I'm afraid they're on
a training day. Okay.
Thank you. Training day. Uh, regarding the source -- Do you want me to use fair means
or foul? I don't mind,
but I would rather not know. Ray? I need you to deliver this
to The World. And on your way back, get
yourself into the tax office. Yes, boss. Hello? Mr. Coughlan,
it's Tara Rafferty. I need you to sign some papers. Can you meet me
at the forecourts? Sure. Tara, what happened last night?
You just left. Yeah. Sorry, Gillian.
That was rude of me. And this one. I just really wanted to see
Eric. And? And we have a problem. What do you mean? Oh. That's you all sorted.
I'll call you later. Just try and keep thinking
about who the source might be. Thanks for that, Gillian. Carmel? I need to make
a short service application before the judge arrives --
It's five minutes max. You're kidding.
The list is jammers in there. I know. I know.
It's so urgent. Listen. We also need to apply for it
to be heard this evening. -You're having me on.
-I'm afraid I'm not. The other side know
I'm making the application. Is there any chance
I can mention it to him now? Please.
It's so important. Ray?
We have the hearing at 4:30. I'll serve the paperwork
on The World by fax and e-mail. I need you to meet me on the
front steps of the forecourts -with my papers.
-Yeah. I'm on it. Ray, I can trust you, can't I? You will be here. You're not gonna stumble
up in an alley and snort some diet supplements,
are you? That's very harsh, Tara. -I'll see you there in a bit.
-Okay. Pete? Yeah. -Can I borrow your jacket?
-Yeah. Go on. Cheers, brother. How are you doing? I'm fine. Vincent's fronting this one up,
so he'll be here any minute. A bit of a day,
one way or another. -Our replying affidavit.
-Thanks a million. This is Vincent Pike.
Leave a message after the tone. Vincent, where are you?
We're starting. Ms. Rafferty,
where's your counsel? He's on his way, Judge. Sorry. You pushed it on
and asked for 4:30. Are there papers? TARA:
Um... Uh, my grounding affidavit. And I've just been handed The World's
responding affidavit. As have I.
Carry on. Um, in my respectful
submission... ...um, the publication
of this video constitutes a gross infringement
of my client's privacy rights, a man, moreover, whose personal
and professional life are at stake. Ms. Walsh,
what do you have to say? Ms. Rafferty has made the point,
Judge. Mr. Coughlan, who presents
the TV show "Mr. Money Man," has carefully cultivated
and nurtured a public image. Exhibit 5, Judge. As you will see
from these press cuttings, Mr. Coughlan
has relentlessly stimulated the interest of the public
with articles and features freely or even aggressively
sought out by him and including images
of his home and his homelife. JUDGE:
Ms. Rafferty? Um... Nobody, whatever their position
in life... ...whatever their errors
in taste or judgment, however they may have broken
trust or vows of fidelity, nobody loses their right
to privacy or dignity. Very well. The defendant
has published material of a highly sensitive
and damaging nature to Mr. Coughlan
and his private affairs. It is striking
that the defendant has not denied its actions
in its replying affidavit. Instead, it argues that
Mr. Coughlan's public persona ought to deprive him
of his privacy in this case. Mr. Coughlan deserves the
full protection of this court to spare him
from the irreparable harm that would necessarily be caused
by the defendant's actions. I'm going to make an order
restraining The World and The World Online from any further publication
or dissemination of this video either online or in print. I will reserve costs
of the hearing of the action. I'm sorry I was late. I was on the phone
to the minister, and... Well... ERIC:
Tara, I'm so sorry. I wish I could make it
so that it never happened. I love you,
and I need to see you. Please. So they've taken the video down, but we still haven't found
the source. WOMAN:
You've been a naughty boy. Tara? Mum? Mum. What is going on? We were meant to have lunch. Oh, I'm sorry, Mum. There's just been, um... We're, uh, we're -- we're --
we're working here. I talked to Eric. Did you? Good. Could these people please leave? No. Look, Mum, we're
in the middle of a meeting. W-Why don't I call 'round
tomorrow? Hey? Have you left
Dunbar and Calloway's? -Yes, probably.
-What? And set yourself up
as a hill bandit? Mum, please.
Look, tomorrow, okay? Tomorrow. Mrs. Rafferty. May I escort you to the door? I promise I will be there. Right. Okay. Where are we at with this? Connor. They pulled the film. I'm so grateful, Tara. You're welcome. But, um...there have been rumors
on social media, and, um, I'm afraid I may lose
my job. TV Ireland have pulled my show
tomorrow. Have they? That was a little bit previous
of them. I'll fix this, Connor.
Come over here and take a seat. Come on. Just here. Where are we at with this, Meg? Do you notice anything
about this film? If it was filmed with a mobile
or a handheld camera, it would be wobbling
or moving around. This is filmed
with a decent camera. Probably a triplex system.
Very easy to disguise. Thanks, Meg. Connor, you have to help us
to help you. Where was this filmed? There's a club --
a sex club near Leeson Street. Members only. Were you aware
you were being filmed? Oh, God, no. There are no cameras or phones
or anything allowed. Okay. So what else? No.
Nothing. I just came to thank you
for getting the film pulled. There's no guarantee
there won't be others. I suppose not. That's the risk. I'll, um...
I'll leave it with you. MEG: Why is that guy not telling
us everything? Ray told me you're also
a private detective. -Mm-hmm.
-You free tomorrow? It's a Saturday. Please? I'll make some time. I've got a job for you. It's an interesting one. Mm. That reminds me of someone. But who? I really like it. But I thought
it would be bigger. We've had an 18-person
Mongolian clusterfuck in here. It's deceptive. But we do have a bigger room. Phew. This is my boss, Pauline. We have a potential new member. I like new members. [ Whistles ]
What is that? That is a sling. You can hang it anywhere, then you can maneuver
your partner at your pleasure. Can't wait. Do you have a partner? We prefer it the first few
visits if people come in pairs. Well, I have a couple of lovers
who might be persuaded. You're a voyeur, I see. Hm. That's good. People like people to watch
as well as to join in. Now perhaps I should take
your details. Maybe I should just think
about it for a while. I hope you don't mind. It's a big step. But I promise you
you will never look back. Connor? Connor? MEG: Perfect location
in a big sculpture. Exactly the right angle. Tara. Sorry. Um, it's a concealed camera? I'm certain of it. Okay. Sorry, Meg.
Hang on one sec. -Meg, can I call you back?
-Yeah. Tara Rafferty speaking. Hello, Tara.
It's Fran Coughlan. He's gone. And there's a new film. Somebody e-mailed it to Connor. It has to be a warning
or a threat. Okay.
Do you know where he's gone? I have no idea.
He just drove off. But I'm worried for him. It's a little bit much for him. Do you want to call the guards? FRAN: No.
He wouldn't thank me for that. TARA:
Okay. G-Give me his car reg, and I'll
do what I can to find him. Meg. I've traced the number plate and
that mobile number you gave me. Okay. And it looks like he's driving
towards Dalkey. Oh, and I found two creditor
claims against the sex club. Really? Cash-flow issues. Well, that figures.
Okay -- Tara, he's parked up now,
on Killiney Hill. Thank you. We checked out
a private members' club that Connor had used. Pretty sure we know
where the camera was located to spy on him. He told me. He also told me that they were
trying to blackmail him. A man he'd never met before spoke to him in
the changing room at that club. Said if he didn't leave
two grand in his jacket next time he came,
they'd expose him. Fran, I hope you don't mind
me saying this, but you don't seem rattled
by any of this. I knew what he was up to,
more or less. He was always a little
sexually incontinent, perhaps. But we all have different ways
of getting our kicks. He's my husband. But I don't own him. Do you want to talk to him
or will I? I already did.
You try. Connor. I just walked up with Fran. She's pretty amazing. She told me
all about the blackmail. Thing is, we all have our stuff. Behind their windows
and curtains, every home has their secrets. It's just when someone gets
caught out in the cold like you have, everyone sneers and jeers
and chucks rocks. It's a cheap and nasty laugh. We're gonna do everything
that we can, Connor. I'm gonna stop those films. You're gonna keep your job, and this is all gonna pass
into memory. The stoning mob
are gonna move on. You're a very kind woman. Let's go home. So the camera's in there?
In the knob? MEG:
Certainly is. On the top. Hello.
What are you doing here? Hi.
Tara Rafferty, solicitor. I'm acting for Connor Coughlan. I'm sure you know who I mean. I'm afraid I have to ask you
to leave. You just be quiet
and listen to me. You are so lucky
that my main concern is the happiness, welfare,
and privacy of my client. I could call the guards, get all manner of warrants
issued against you. I could start
my own disclosure proceedings, get a judge to order you to open
all your books, all your club rules,
all your membership lists. But best for Mr. Coughlan
if you just refrain from releasing any more films
of my client. Oh, and do tell your boss. Pauline, is it? Or we will. Thanks, Meg.
I know how busy you are. No problem. Oh, hello, darling. Oh, lovely flowers. CONRAD:
How you doing? Come on.
Let's -- Let's go in. -Now, Tara.
-Now, darling. Sorry, Mum. I'm not very hungry
at the moment. You have to eat
no matter what's going on. Eric told me what happened. And...I have told Daddy. It's all right, love. It must have been so...crushing. Yes, it was. Well, that's covered, that,
then. Well, Eric was very sad and very sorry and ashamed
and... Contrite. Penitent? Upbraided? Yes. He wants to win you back. Mum, this has all just happened. I-I can't even think straight
at the moment. We absolutely understand and empathize
with how you are feeling. But trust me. Time heals. So I've heard. So I propose to take time. CONRAD:
Irene. Yes.
Of course. But... But what?
What is this? Some attempt to save
the wedding? Yeah, time might heal, Mum. But two weeks is gonna heal
what I'm feeling? But you are
such a lovely couple. Listen to me. If this is about the wedding,
I will cover all the costs. I'll pay for everything. People make mistakes. Your father's been no angel. Jesus.
Irene. Listen.
You're not hearing me, Mum. You're not hearing me. This can't just be patched up. Tara, I think you need to -- No. Just stop it, please.
Just listen to me, okay? Tara, what has happened to you? What's happened to me? I have just found
the man I love, the man I was about to marry, deep inside
a professional colleague! And he was fucking loving it! Tara. CONNOR: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to "Mr. Money Man." I'm Connor Coughlan,
and it's been another... RICHARD: He's represented
by Dunbar and Calloway's. He's our client. Tara's well within her rights. She didn't sign a contract
with us. We never got 'round to it. Get the wedding back on. Offer her a partnership.
I don't care what. But I do care about
having to uninvite half of Dublin's biggest hitters and of looking as big a fool
as you already do. Do you understand? I do. I will do anything
to make it right... ...to get you back. This can't be it. You can't just stop loving me. I don't know how I feel. I want you to be my wife. Eric, the wedding is gone. Us? I don't know. Loving you was all that I knew. And now everything has changed. I have to go. Where's Karen? If it's Sunday, it's rock climbing
with the Hermann Hesse Society. Ooh.
Yummy. A smorgasbord of paperwork.
Our favorite. VINCENT:
Yeah. Only there's one part
I'm missing. I've got statements from
all levels of the department -- health board, consortium,
architects, contractor,
and project managers -- but nothing from
the vital source, Timothy York, the man who recommended
the Irish Oak bid, as he is inconveniently
and irredeemably dead. Oh. Oh. Connor called
on his way to the studio. Thinks you're a goddess. Yeah, he's right.
I am. You know, once the broadcasters
heard "Unfair Dismissals Act" and "high court damages
and costs," they folded. Honestly, Tara,
I don't know how you've done it considering what's been
going on. Don't be nice to me
or I will cry. Okay. How marvelous that you've
finally found your level, practicing out of a toilet
at the back of a cafe with a team of miscreants,
myself included. That's better. I have to go home. You're welcome to stay
for supper. Oh, thank you,
but I need my bed. Okay. Well... TARA:
Beautiful holiday. Fancy room.
Champagne. Wow!
There he is. -Ciao, bella.
-[ Laughs ] Good tan. You're more photogenic, so you
should switch that around. I think you should definitely
switch that around! -That's right.
-Oh! Now, day one... -Day one.
-...of our special holiday. Yeah. You've been working
on your tan. -Uh-huh.
-Me, not so much. No. A bit of a farmer's tan,
you have. This is so lovely.
I don't want to go home. -I love you.
-I love you more. ERIC: We should send this
to your parents. TARA: Look, genuinely,
I am so hungry. -Can we please have food first?
-Yeah. TARA:
[ Laughing ] Please.
