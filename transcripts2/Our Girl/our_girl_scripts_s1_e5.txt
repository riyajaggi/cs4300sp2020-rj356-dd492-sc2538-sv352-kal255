 - Come back to me. - I will. - Why can't you just be my mate? - Because I love you. How did you propose to your wife? - You're married and you didn't think to say! - We split up! Molls, I'm going to give you something now and no strings attached. - You ruined everything! - Do not bring personal onto battlefield. - Is that understood? - You did. Am I going to die? Move! - Bashira? - She's safe. Not any more.

 Two Cat A, urgent medevac required. - Where are they? - Get to the hospital. Molly! - Jackie. What's happening? Where are they? - Calm down. - Boss man... - His pulse is dropping. Is he going to be all right? I've got to go. Smurf. He died in the MERT! - What? - They had to resuscitate him twice. - We're gonna lose him. - He's going to be all right. - What have I done? What have I done? - It wasn't your fault. No. It was yours and the boss's. ♪ ALEX CLARE: War Rages On

I should have been hit, not them. I'd do anything to make sure they were all right. I'd swap places in a flash. I'd like you to have a chat with the doctor. - Can you sort that, Corporal? - Yes, sir. I'm not mad, sir. I'm just saying, if it was me and not them then everything would be all right. I shouldn't have got involved. - Involved? - If I hadn't got involved with Bashira, the boss and Smurf'd be fine, I wouldn't have had to kill anyone. - They're going to be fine. - How do you know that? Exactly. The others are about to get some scoff. I think we should join them. I'll go find someone to square Smurf and the boss's kit away. [ll doit. OK.

Doesn't feel very normal at the moment, though. It will do. Takes a long time. But one day everything feels normal again. Do you think Bashira's found "normal" yet? She will do. One day. Please, Qaseem, find out where she is and go and see her. Just let me know that she's all right. Will you do that for me? Please, Qaseem. Just this one thing. I know if you promise me you'll do it, you will, cos you're a decent bloke. Goodbye, Molly Dawes. (Shouting) Get down! Stay down! MOLLY: Man down! Man down! Captain James is down! - (Gunfire) - Hold your fire! There you go. You're a gent. There ain't many of us left, as my grandad says. Don't fancy a dip in the sea? I can't really swim. Don't tell that lot of piss-taking tossers. How'd you get in the army? - Pulled a sickie that day. - (Laughs) There's people here you can talk to, you know. I'm talking to you. You know what I'm talking about. I just wanna go home. This is pointless. It's decompression. If we were complete I'd understand. But we ain't, we're two down. Look, I know you were pretty loved up by him, but... he's in the best possible hands. Come on, it was a bit obvious. What? You and Smurf. Thank God he's gonna be all right. What d'you mean by that? You said, "Thank God, he's gonna be all right," like the boss isn't. The boss is gonna have to have an operation. Why? There's been complications. Is that bad? Well, it's not good, Dawes. But at least you've got Smurf. ♪ LISA HALL: Is This Real? ♪ Feeding the concept would drive me insane Jd Flesh to blood to bone to love ♪ Twisted 4 And I know 4 Yes, I know ♪ But is this real? 4 And I know 4 Yes, I know ♪ But is this real? There's only one thing worse than not having your parents turn up. - That's your parents turning up. - (Laughs) - Molls! - Right on cue. I've been worried sick about you. I'm back now. You've come back to me. - Nan! - Nan hired a Corsa for us to get here. That was nice of her, eh? She hasn't driven for 20 years and she was shit, then. It's confidence-shattering having him sitting next to me. Seriously, Molls, he's in the back on the way home. - Can you come home, so I can look after you? - I'm not coming straight back, Mum. I've got to go to the hospital and see Smurf and that. - Oh. - Birmingham. Well, we'll drop you off, then. Come here. You can't even drive, mate, so wind your neck in! I also can't fly a plane but I'm being rocked about like I'm on a waltzer. I asked you to marry me on a waltzer, Belinda. Just before I spewed my guts up. Was that cos of the waltzer or the question? (Laughs) I'll pay for the petrol, Nan. Don't be so daft. Your dad can. Tight old mare. Right, fellas, double it up. - Where's Dawesy? - Probably making herself look beautiful. Lucky you didn't bother. We'd be waiting a week. - Saying I'm a minger? - I'm saying, have a look in the mirror. Go on. I happen to know I'm beautiful, me. Birmingham ain't far, is it? You can drop me off at a station. I don't mind. - It's fine. - Yeah, we'll take you. You must be tired. - And you've got your uniform on and that. - Most people don't hate us, Mum. Some people appreciate us. And they don't mind you going straight to Birmingham? No, I asked. It's cos I'm the medic. I'm allowed. You were never one for rules and regulations, eh? ♪ LISA HALL: Is This Real? Doors closing. He's in theatre. The boss. What's happening? The first operation last week doesn't seem to have done the trick. He got rushed into theatre about an hour ago. You've come just in time. Is it that bad? The next 12 hours are apparently, you know... So the nurses have said. He's a fighter. Some things you just can't fight. Smurf, I'm sorry. I understand if you hate me. Shut up. How are you doing? I got a lucky escape. Not that lucky. The scars will heal. Smurf, I know it's all my fault. I guess you can't help your feelings any more than I can help mine. Nothing happened between me and the boss. I mean, nothing actually happened. It didn't need to, did it? - If I could have my time again... - What? - Seriously, what would you do different? - All of it. I'd do everything differently. But you'd still love the boss. What would you do different? You know. What? I'd call you after that night. Who knows how things could have panned out then. He's going to be in theatre a long time. Why don't you go and rest? I promised myself I'd wait here. I'll wait here. OK. - How is he? - It was an emergency operation. No-one expected this latest bleed. We'll be monitoring him throughout the night and let's see where we are in the morning. - Thank you. - Now go and get some sleep. I'm not going anywhere. Nor me. - He looks bad. - You can't tell. Do you want your ring back? - You might need it one day. - Shut your cakehole. 4 BIRDY: People Help The People ♪ God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts ♪ Guess he kissed the girls and made them cry ♪ Those hard-faced queens of misadventure ♪ God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken lives ♪ Fiery throne of muted angels - Sorry. ♪ Giving love but getting nothing back oh 4 People help the people 4 And if you're homesick, give me your hand and I'll hold it 4 People help the people 4 Nothing will drag you down... How did you know we were here? I wasn't sure you were. Morphine. Well, I'm drug-free and I can see you, so I guess I must be here. - Smurf? - I'm drug-free too, boss. - Are you? - You talking about hospital drugs? Oh, yeah. I'm full to bursting with them. Can't give me enough. I dunno what I was thinking, boss. I lost control. We all did. Taught me I'm no soldier. I'm proud to have served alongside you, Smurf. Anyway, I'm not missing the hospital breakfast. - Are you going? - I've seen the boss. I'm outta here. How are you feeling? You're going to be all right. - Hello, scamp. - Mum, Mum! They didn't rub it offl They didn't rub it offl This is someone who helped Daddy in Afghanistan. - I wouldn't be here if it weren't for her. - Yeah, sorry about that. (Laughs) You're funny. What I mean is, she saved my life. I'd have bled out if it weren't for her prompt actions. - I'd better go. - Don't go on my account. I'd better go. It's good to see you, Dawes. Ditto. I thought it was you. I saw you from the car park. Have you seen him? He's going to be all right. I promise. She's saved me twice now, haven't you, Dawesy? Put that bloody phone down. You'll affect the hospital machines and whatnot. That's bollocks, Mum. Like phones in planes. It doesn't do anything. They just don't want people talking away and annoying each other. (Phone vibrates) Guess what? They're on their way. - Smurf? - Smurfy? Where is he? Where's old Sicknote? (Cheering) - Dawsey. - You're only allowed two visitors at a time. We're war heroes. No rules! I know what you're gonna say. And fair enough, I'll take the bollocking. You wanted to get up here and see Smurf. We do have a modicum of compassion in the British Army. - Sol ain't in trouble? - No. But you are coming back to the barracks with us. Understood? - How is he? - Take a look. He's been through a lot on tour. Understandable he... We all know what he did. We all respond to contact in different ways. I just wanna make sure there's no repercussions for him. While you're all here I might go and get a drink. OK. (Overlapping voices) Smurf, good to see you, pal. Has Rebecca gone? She went whilst I was on my second tour. You know what I mean. I wasn't very good at the life she wanted. What life was that? Settled, I guess. Not so good at that. I've always preferred being on tour, living out of a Bergen. The army is all I've ever known, it's all I've ever wanted. I'm sorry. Until I met you. I've still got Afghan grime in my hair. I don't think I could have lived with myself if I'd managed to get you killed. It wasn't your fault. I was the officer. I failed you. And the rest of the platoon. You didn't fail anybody. I'm resigning my commission. It happened on my watch. What are you going to do? I'm not sure. What I do know is, there's nothing in our way any more. We don't have to wait out. Parade!

Our CO, Captain James, injured on four, wrote up a member of our section for an honour six months ago, after an extraordinary act of courage. "Private Dawes has been recognised on the operational honours and awards list for her bravery and valour on Op Herrick. Private Dylan Smith was injured and with no regard to her personal safety, she put his life ahead of her own. To save a life whilst being willing to sacrifice your own is above and beyond the call of duty. Her Majesty the Queen has found it fitting to award Private Dawes the Military Cross. Molls, we have so got to come to the Palace with you. Oh, mate, put me down for a bit of that. We'll have to grab ourselves one of them swanky stretch limos. Mansfield, we might get to meet your doppelganger. - Doppel-gingal - (Laughter) This muppet reckons he looks like Prince Harry. - About as much as I look like Duchess Kate! - (Laughter) I am the proudest dad in the whole world right now, fellas. My little girl. - Just drop the bullshit now, yeah? - That's it. I don't want to hear any more! How was what I did heroic? - You deserve it, Molls. - Course she did. - You heard what that Captain said. - Yeah, from his hospital bed! Valour and all that. Bravery on the battlefield. Oh, here she is. You're a chip off the old block, ain't you, Molls? - You all right? - Yeah. Isn't she brilliant? (Alert from phone) What was that? It's just an email, Nan. Relax. Smurf? What? Nothing. Come on, it's bloody something. It's just a friend of mine from Afghan. A soldier? No. He's a teacher at a university. They've got a university in Af-bleeding-ghanistan? Bet they don't have to pay nine grand to go there! He's looking after a little friend of mine. Well, he's trying to. (Sighs) Why is nothing ever simple, Nan? What is it? Come on, tell your nan. - I'm going for a run. - Tell me first. We got this little girl into a safe house in Kabul. My friend was trying to see her and when he finally got permission he found out she'd been moved, so now he's got to start the process over. I'm sure she'll be all right. Are you? Cos I sure as hell haven't got a bloody clue! It's tearing me apart, Nan. - Why? - Because I might have ruined her life. I might have even killed her. Kabul is so dangerous. I'm going for a run, Mum. Round here? You're brave. Of course you are, you're in the army! You've got medals for it. I might run up to Stratford and run round the park there. She's going stir crazy. Just crazy, Nan. Maybe they can sort us out a double room. You cracking up an' all? You'd have to be insane not to crack up with the life I've had. - (Toilet flushes) - (Laughter) - Oh, fuck me, the coven taking the piss again? - Oh, yeah. I'm thinking of doing an Iron Man next year. - What's one of them? - Running, cycling, swimming. Endurance thing. Once I've pumped up the tyres on my bike, I'm full-time on it. (Laughs) I'd do anything to get into shape for the woman I love. - Put her down, it's quite vomit-inducing. - (Both laugh) - Did you say you're going out, Molly? - Going for a run. - Why, are you coming? - I'm starting tomorrow. Get us some rolling papers. I got some change upstairs. Nah, it's all right. Got 14 grand in the bank. - Deployment money. - Get us some baccy an' all then! ‘Ere, I might get you to buy me a new Beemer, Molls, eh? Remember your old man when you're flashing the cash. Not long now and that'll all be luxury houses. What, round here? Might have marble worktops but they still gotta look out the window and see you in your pants. I've been over there. West Ham. Told them you've come home an hero. They said they want you as a guest of honour. Plus one. Me. - Football? - Do it for Daddy, Molls. I can't afford to go else. All you gotta do is walk around the pitch. No. Nip over there. Ben'll show you what you gotta do. No, Dad! There's a free meal and everything! And I get to meet my heroes. 4 Paolo Di Canio, Paolo Di Canio 4 Paolo Di Canio Excuse me. You dropped this. Want to buy...? (Children's voices) Come on, quick. Quick, move. Mum said upstairs. Give me that back. It's not fairl Give it back! What's the matter with the cheese you've cut off? - Don't like the end bits. - It's cheddar. Ain't any end bits! There's people in the world that'd be grateful for that cheese! Some people are trying to survive in places so frightening... (Dog barks in near distance) (Phone vibrates and rings) Hello? Qaseem, it's me. Molly Dawes. I'm sorry to call you. I just wanted to talk to you. Did you get my email? Yeah. What's happened? I'm trying to track her down. The authorities say that they moved her from the first house... ..because she was in danger. Qaseem, we have to find her, we have to make sure she's safe. How the hell do we do that? You deserve another medal for tackling this kitchen. There was a lump of Marmite under the window that I swear was there before I went on tour. I'm such a slovenly madam. (Molly sniffs) I'm dying, Mum. What are you saying? What are you talking about, Moll? Don't be daft. - I'm no hero. - What? I dunno whether what I done in Afghan was good or bad. I'm worried that I put that little girl's life in danger. What little girl? I killed her father. What have they done to you, Molly? I'll look after you, baby. I'll always look after you. We're your family. I had her taken away from her family, Mum. I just need to know she's all right. It's all gotta have been for something, hasn't it, Mum? You're home now. You're with me. I don't know what I was thinking. It just all seemed possible. Everything seemed possible on tour. And coming home is like... Coming home is like waking up. Oh, Molly. You look beautiful. You don't look too shabby yourself. - Even with a limp? - Especially with a limp. - It's cute. - (Laughs) - I can see it's a nice place. - The restaurant? - No, Bath and that. - Yeah. Yeah, it is. So are you going to stay here, then, boss? Charles. Charles? - Are you smirking? - No. What's so fucking hilarious about Charles? What are you going to do, call me "boss man" for the rest of our lives? Previous there, weren't you? Well, it's chemistry. - I failed that. - You know what I mean. - Do you want me to choose for you? - No. So you're going to stay in Bath, then, Charles? I've got some rehab at Headley Court and then, yeah. Back here for a bit. There's worse places to be holed up, I guess. Thanks. Cheers. So how's it been back home? You coping? Obviously it's a different ballbag with you and that. But being back with my parents... I just can't sit still. I can't get a calmness in my nut. It just feels wrong. Has your CO been in touch? He forwards me on MOD trials and things I might be interested in. He'll want to keep you in. What about you? No. I don't think sitting behind a desk is my kind of bag. Not half. Sitting behind a desk does my head in. Ever since school. There you go. The kinship is just as undeniable as the difference. - Whatever. - I mean... Well, maybe we're more alike than we know. That was obvious from being on tour. Did you just wipe cabbage on my hand? I didn't want to soil the napkin. What happened on tour... I know I failed you. I failed myself. You're not to blame, Molly. It all just fell to shit. I hear Afghan when I shut my eyes to sleep - and when I wake up... - You think you're back there. I don't know... I don't know where I am. I'm all over the shop. What trials has your CO sent you? It doesn't matter. It's all about mentoring Afghan medics. Don't you want me to stay with you? I want you to be brilliant. What does that even mean? It means...I love you. You don't know me. You only know the me on tour. You can only see the tip of an iceberg but you know it's an iceberg. Are you calling me an iceberg? I'd be on that plane with you given half a chance. You think I should go? I don't think you've got a choice. You're only part way through a journey. I'm looking for something. I'm just crapping myself at what I might find. And you're not going to find it stuck here with me. Driving me back and forth to rehab. I can't drive. I'm all right, thank you. I've been desperate to kiss you. Since we first kissed. My parents are at Lake Garda. - The house is empty. - (Laughs) What's funny? - There is nothing funny about that. - It's the way you said it. Like you were desperate to lure me back. Well, did it work? I thought I was going to have to go halves on a Travel Lodge. ♪ LEWIS WATSON: Stay 4 When I close my eyes, I hear you singing ♪ Singing me a song that I'll forget, I always forget ♪ I try to trick myself back to sleeping ♪ You pick me up ♪ But let you down ♪ It was so clear, but now it's gone 4 I couldn't keep my eyelids shut ♪ Why can't you stay? ♪ Stay ♪ Stay ♪ If only I could dream, we could start again - What is it? - What did we have on our first ever date? - The Wimpy on the Barking Road. - Exactly. - Ice cream floaters! - Yes! - (Laughter) - (Doorbell) Doorl What is it?

We are going to Vegas, for a laugh. - How much are the flights, then? - I dunno. It's a bit confusing. 700-odd quid by the looks of it. That's for economy. We're not going economy. Hark at you. Premium economy, a grand and a bit. Five grand for Upper Class. That's a bit more like us, innit? - No. - Come on, my treat. You ain't spending that amount of dough on flights. I'll go with you instead, Smurf. - Seriously, you'd have a lot better time with me. - Thanks, Dad. Do they really call it Upper Class? - That's sick. - Yeah. They might as well call the other two Middle Class and Lower Class and just be done! I'm booking Upper Class. I've got loads of money to get rid of. This screen's really doing my nut in. You might gonna need glasses. Oh, don't say that! D'you reckon? - You getting headaches, Smurf? - Yeah. That's it, then. You need glasses. - Jeez, what's next?

You see them on the telly all the time and, I dunno, I'd never get tired of being in one! - A black taxi? - I can't stand London but I love buses and black cabs. - You have to pay, you know. - I got loads of money. No class, mind! That's true. Not long, Molls, and you'll be in there hobnobbing with them all. Don't think you sit round having a cuppa. Will you mention me? To Her Majesty? I'l tell her what a prize pranny you are. For Queen and country. That's what it's all been about, Moll. - Will you stay in? - Only till I'm better. - I have to see a psychiatrist. - Really? I mentioned I've been having these dreams. Real vivid. Do you know what I mean? About Afghan? Yeah. Reliving it every night. Wake up and the bed's soaking. I've gotta talk it all through with someone. We're all fragged. How can we not be? What are you gonna do after you leave? Well, my uncle's got a garage in Merthyr. He's gonna fix me up to do an apprenticeship. To be honest, I only joined up cos of my brother. I don't wanna put my mum through another tour. Yeah, it's probably a good call. I don't know if I'm ready to quit yet. You're still coming to bloody Vegas with me. Especially after I splashed out on that dress. How did you know what size I was? I asked my mum. Yeah, I am bloody coming to Vegas with you. As my best mate. As your best mate. More than happy with that. I know you've set your sights a bit above wife of mechanic in Merthyr. I've got something that'll impress you. (Chuckles) Oh, whoa. OK. I'm a bit impressed. I'm a war hero, apparently. Imagine standing out here in front of 30-odd thousand people on a match day. I haven't said I'll do it yet. You've got to. Besides, I've only got to walk round the edge. People love soldiers nowadays. Go for it. My dad's keen cos he gets a free ticket! He's proud of you. I dunno. I just don't feel like a hero. I find it all a bit embarrassing. You saved me and your local club wants to honour you. Don't let them down. It's a big life ahead. You might not get another opportunity. It is a big life ahead, isn't it? Yes, mate. You gotta run at life like you're running into the unknown. That is what you're doing, I suppose. You never know what's round the corner. It could be a cliff, could be a... Ah, I dunno, just ignore me. Everything'll work out for you. I know it. If I ever buy a car, can I come to Merthyr and have a free service? Mates rates. Not free. Don't push it. And the Smurfoid takes on one man, beats another, and shoots! Goal! Bingo! Goal! West Ham nil, Newport three! Smurf, what are you doing? Smurf? Newport weren't big enough for Geraint. Sometimes I dream he's still alive. Then I wake up and wonder whether I dreamt he's dead. Smurf, what's the matter? Maybe... Smurf, I can't understand a word of what you're saying. Smurf. Smurf, talk to me. Where does it hurt? Smurf, talk to me, OK? Don't do this. Don't fucking do this!

The rest of us are heading out of here, you've come back! Training Afghan medics. So I'll be back in Nuneaton and you'll be in Kabul. Exactly. - You take care, for gawd's sake. - (Laughs) It just feels right. They used to talk about the "golden hour", how we as medics had the first hour to treat the patient to intervene to save their lives. Now the talk is of the "platinum 10 minutes" and if you think about the narrow window of opportunity, it kind of highlights the need for prompt action in the field in order to minimise the loss of limb or life in Afghanistan. (Applause) - I've found her. - I want to see her, then. Please, Molly. It can never happen. Yes, it can. I've been excused the VIP lunch. - We've got two hours. - Then we sit here and talk.

Yes, I do. Please, come on. I'll go on my own, Qaseem. You know that, don't you? Yes. You couldn't have written to her like any normal person? I ain't a normal person, Qaseem. You know that. This is true. I'm giving you my 14-grand deployment money. So that she can have an education and everything that she needs to have a life. Besides, I know you won't spend it on wine, women and song. - I like a nice song. - (Laughs) You will look after her for me, won't you? The guards know me. I will tell them you are my wife. Can't I be your glamorous younger sister? The children do lessons in the morning, then come into that courtyard there. When they arrive, we walk out and talk to the guards. You have one minute with Bashira and then back in the car. (Children's voices) OK. It's just children coming. I will open the door for you. How are you? Good to see you. This is my wife.
