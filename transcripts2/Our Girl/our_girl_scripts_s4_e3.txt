 Doctor Bahil's adamant she wants to travel into the Kowt-e-Ashro region tomorrow. 250 children remain unvaccinated. Who give you all that? That's what happens when you're on guardian angel duty for the Yanks. Giti's gone. Her uncle. He took her. How do we know that she's being looked after? Something to tell the folks back home, eh? There is no-one back home, she left me. ON PHONE: I don't want a life without you in it. She's not responding. We're being ambushed. Move, move. We have to get them back to the vehicle!

 Poya! Where you going?! She's gone, they've got her! Long time no hear, Hasan. Are you shitting us or what? Is that... Is that you, Blue? What did we tell you would happen if you stopped communicating? You've not been keeping to your side of the bargain, you little Geordie jockstrap. You're supposed to be our eyes and ears in this region. Your job was to tell us where Omar's been hiding himself. Yeah, Omar's people, blud. They're not... They're not normal. If he knew about me talking to you, he'd pour petrol down my throat and light it. Look, we got a deal.

 You help us locate Omar and we sort you out getting back to the UK. But I've never actually seen him, man! He directs his operations from afar. I know that he's in the tunnels in the mountains somewhere, but I don't have a clue where. We've been following you, going from farm to farm, handing out large wads of Omar's money. That doesn't mean I've seen him! You're paying for the opium and then someone else drives round and collects it. Look, I just do the job I'm told to do. But, remember, we're your safe passage out of here, despite you being a silly little boy in Syria. So start being useful. Have you seen this woman? I think now would be a good time to start talking. Look, I swear, I don't know anything. Do you know how big Omar's territory is? It's the entire region of the mountains and half of Kabul! I mean, she could be any-frigging-where! They're not going to tell me where she is, are they? Boss, we need to go. Pull over! No, no, no, no, no, no! HE YELLS We'll be back. How the hell do I get home from here? Get an Uber! You tossers! MUSIC: Battlecry by Jordan Mackampa # Can you hear the people marching louder than the drums? # Can you hear the people coming louder than the drums? # Can you hear the people marching louder than the drums? # Can you hear the people coming? # Can you hear the people marching louder than the drums? # This is our battle cry # Can you hear the people marching louder than the drums? # This is our battle cry. # So let me get this straight, your team had eyes on the vehicle throughout and no-one noticed the driver was shot, dragged from the vehicle and replaced by an insurgent, Mr Hurst? We were coming down the hillside. Receiving incoming fire, sir... Do you want to know what I think? The life we were supposed to be protecting, at best, in extreme jeopardy. Exactly, sir. We need to locate and extract her. I think Omar has her, or at least... I understand your personal connection to Omar. This is about Dr Bahil, sir. And it is being dealt with. Thank you, Sergeant Lane. DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS Sir, I take full responsibility, Dr Bahil went missing on my watch. Your father's the chivalrous type, too. We're not going to let a local difficulty like this derail his son's career. Thank you, Colour. DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS How's it being dealt with, Kingy? There's a line of squaddies with rashes outside your office, deal with that. Look, I've been thinking that maybe we should... Please, don't. ..Dr Bahil, all right? What is the plan? It's being dealt with at the appropriate level. Way above your head - which isn't in the game at the moment, Lane. Literally, babe, I have got all this stuff and I can not pick what to wear. I just... And how am I supposed to know what I'm going to need? Babe, you don't need all that gear. Just hand luggage. Babe, it's my honeymoon. I'm going to need things for the evening and I can't exactly wear the same thing twice. Trunks and a T-shirt. That's all I need. I beg you two, shut up. I've read the same line nine times now. Are you all right, Monk? Don't worry, babes, Mr Loverman will be back with you in 48 hours. Good. I'm starting to miss the goofy twat now. HE CHUCKLES Yeah. I love you, Marie. I love you. Love you. No, you put down the phone first. It's all bollocks, but it's what you got to do when you're in love, man. Have you lads got Wi-Fi in here? It is absolutely shit in the girls' block. Fingers is hogging it, Mimi. And no one use it tomorrow, I'm Skyping in for Thumper's birthday. I'm trying to Google Giti, but all I'm getting is a blank page. Was you hoping to find her on Insta? No, obviously. I just want to make sure she's OK, is that such a sin? You OK, Prof? Yeah. Fine. Sometimes I just need a bit of peace and quiet. Yeah, it's like my mum and dad when they're reading. They're teachers, too. Ooh! Yes! All right. Fingers, you got your medical. Georgie will be ready in five. Yeah, I'm on it. Just got to put my boots on. # We wish you a Merry Christmas # We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! # Throbber, you beauty. What's going on? Father Christmas is here, that's what's going on, Monk lad! Where did you get that all from? Ah, well, you know what? You're not the only one with friends in high places, Monk. Tuck in, boys. Bro. You absolute legend. You know, I shagged a bird from Bournville once. It's a real frigging place. HE LAUGHS I saved his life. I cannot believe I actually bothered. Well done, Throbber, lad! Yeah, yeah, well done, Throbber. Do you have this week's lottery numbers, Poya? Not many people get shot at point-blank range and live to tell the tale. He's a lucky man, for sure. Did you not see any of them, Poya? He'll be questioned when medically fit. Yeah, I understand, but if we get a description now... This man has just been shot. Of course he wants to help, but can't it wait? Dr Bahil's life is in danger. He didn't see anything. I didn't see. What, nothing? Poya, even the smallest detail could save her life. Please... I understand... Sergeant Lane, follow me. Sir, I understand... It is not your job. He's a patient, just undergone surgery... Yeah, and I'm worried about her. You don't think I'm worried about her? That is my best friend out there - somewhere in the mountains. And it's down to me. I mean, was I that determined to get to Omar? No. Dr Bahil says that nothing happens by chance. Is this my bad? Ah, she'd have gone anyway. Not your bad. Yet I was supposed to be protecting her. She knew the risks. She wanted to go out into the field. Are they going to kill her? Looking bleak. It breaks my heart. Excuse me, Dr Antonio. I was just wondering if there's any news on Giti. The little girl that left your hospital. Couple of points, Private. Not my hospital and Giti didn't leave, her uncle discharged her. But we don't know that that was her uncle, do we? Yeah, apparently someone put up "come and collect her" leaflets. You knew my father was in the regiment. Of course. I've never asked for any favours. Sir. Mr Hurst. Colour. Sir. US Comms room, ASAP. That's getting tight as, Georgie. Oi, you're giving me a Chinese burn. Oh, sh... Sorry. Oh. OK? Yes. Yeah? Am I all right - in the normal range? You'll never be in the normal range, you muppet. HE CHUCKLES Are you all right yourself, babes? You seem a bit away with the fairies. KNOCKING AND DOOR OPENS On me. I renounce my un-Islamic manifesto. Unless the elections are called off, I will be killed. My death will be justified. Afghanistan must be. MAN MUTTERS That's the end of the video, Sir. What's going to happen, Sir? Well, the elections aren't going to be called off. Why not!? They're saying they're going to kill her. Lane. We could at least tell them we'll try and get them called off. Come on, we've got to do something here! Dismissed, Sergeant Lane. Her emotional involvement makes unpleasant listening, Mr Hurst. Sir. Excuse me, Sir. Something the Americans want you to look at. Security footage from the American mess. This day just gets better and better, Mr Hurst. Seems you can't control your platoon, Lieutenant. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Stand up. Does anybody know anything about confectionary stolen from the American mess? Not to mention a stolen American uniform. Sir, but... Shut up! I don't want to hear you speak. I don't want to hear another fucking word. Collective responsibility. What does that mean, Prof? Where everyone takes equal blame, Sir. That's right, for one person's crime. Is this yours, wanker? The lads fancied some chocolate, Colour. Oh. So, theft and impersonating an American officer. Sir, none of the others knew nothing about this, Sir. So? You're all on work party punishment duty, starting with a latrine clean. And you're all losing privileges for the foreseeable future - including internet access. Phones, laptops, iPads, into this bag now. Sir. Sir. Sir. And if anybody makes any attempt to defy that, it will become a formal disciplinary matter. This isn't what I expect from this section. And you will get dealt with later. I'm going to miss Thumper's birthday. I tried to fucking fess up, but he wouldn't let me! I'm going to miss his first birthday. Don't you get it? You can keep them as well, mate. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, sorry don't cut it. Impersonating an officer. At least you're not impersonating an idiot. Idiot don't come close. FINGERS SIGHS Do you know you spend three years of your life in a toilet? Can you get any more boring, Prof? There's at least three years. worth in here! Yeah, I've already done five years of mine. I bet you got four cats at home. I think you're mistaking me for your mother. You know what's mad? Right now, my Thumper's opening his first West Ham kit and I'm not even there to see it. Yeah, I'd leave that a few minutes if I were you. What time is it back home, Monk? 11:11. You know what's mad? Whenever I check the time, it's always like 2:22 or 4:44. What do you reckon that means? You're a witch! Absolutely nothing, Monk. Well, it's got to mean something, Prof, otherwise, why does it keep happening? It just means some moments are more significant than others and then you forget about the rest. Significant times. You hear that, Throbber? I've said sorry, bro. Yeah? I've said I wanted to take all the blame. It's not my fault the boss wouldn't hear me. This is actually the first day that I've not spoke to the wife since we've been married. Fuck off. Yeah, I just want to see my little boy. Are you lot just trying to make me feel even more shit than I already do? Oh... FINGERS LAUGHS Whoa. Oh...my...God! Why have you just got to shitty mop all over me?! My bad, bro. For fuck's sake... HE MUTTERS My bad. ..into you! Oh, can this day get any worse?! Oh, my God. That's why you've been showering with your top on, bro! You're not even sunburnt! My Doris made me get it done, all right? Bro, was that tattooist battered or blind? Haven't you done enough already? It's not my fault your missus looks like she's been through a fucking fire. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take... Chill out, man! Bro! I'm joking. ALARM BLARES Fuck's sake! It could be a mortar attack. SHOUTING No, no, no, it's this. It's this. HORN HONKS GUNFIRE Check fire! Check fire! INDISTINCT SHOUTING Blue! It is I. Like a Pound Shop Lawrence of fucking Arabia amidst the rancid cucumbers. "Arrive in a fruit and veg truck," they said. "We'll brief the guys you're coming," they said. "We won't fucking shoot you." I guess I better count my blessings you're shit shots, eh, lads? Let's get that wound seen to, Blue. Not before I've had a shower and some scran. What are you going to do with that? LANE: You don't seem massively phased about being shot. Ah, I'm hungry. SHE CHUCKLES It won't take long. It's not a life-changing injury, is it? It will be for the plank that shot me. Have you seen the Dr Bahil video? That's rather why I'm here. Like looking for a needle in a haystack. There you go. KNOCKING ON DOOR You said I might need some anti-inflammatories. Yeah, yeah. Come in. How are your legs? You need a massage? 50 miles is a long run. No, they're fine. Yeah? OK. HE SIGHS Right, talk, Prof. Nothing to say. My ex-wife's pregnant. Oh, shit. I found out on Facebook. I'm sorry, Prof. She told me she never wanted kids and now I've got a whole lifetime of hearing her news on social media. First, it'll be the baby photos and then I'm guessing they'll get married. And I'll be madly unfriending everyone who likes any picture of her. The first day of school. Going round to her mum's for Christmas. And I can picture him just sat in my place. Sometimes, I just wonder if all this would be easier if she just died. I am so sorry. I didn't mean... Elvis being dead isn't exactly easy for me, Prof. I used to text her 20, 30 times a day. Just little things like how I'd parked the car and about a fluffy cat. It wasn't the sunsets and rainbows, it was the small, normal, everyday things. Yeah. After Elvis died, it was like, a... ..an old voice message that he sent me. And I'd listen to it over and over and over. Just to hear his voice. DOOR OPENS Have you downloaded your BPM stats? Yeah. Yeah? I sent it over. OK. Good. WATCH BLEEPS I think you'll find my heart, ironically, is in fine fettle. SHE CHUCKLES Fuck. What? Shit! I seem to have that effect on women. DOOR SLAMS KNOCKING ON DOOR I think I've cracked it. Sure. Come in. DOOR SHUTS Right, I think I might have a way to track the vehicle that Dr Bahil was abducted in. Right, when we were off on her vaccination mission, Dr Bahil told me to lose my watch. And I took it off and I put in a pouch at the back of the driver's seat. Which means if they're in a Wi-Fi zone, we could locate it through Find My Phone. Dr Bahil. Well, it's showing us which haystack to look for the needle in, which is a start. Time's not really on our side here. We'll send a drone up. This is quite a large area. We'll monitor the footage and hopefully locate the vehicle. KNOCKING ON DOOR Come in. DOOR OPENS You wanted to see me, Colour Sergeant. Helmand Province. When I told my brother I was coming back to Afghan, he told me to look for his leg. He was a Para. They're different gravy. I'm really sorry, Colour Sergeant King. It's not your fault he stood on an IED, is it? I meant I'm sorry about my behaviour and, from henceforth, I'm going to make sure that... I think you're a nice kid. And I think you'll grow into a decent human being. Just not in the army. Colour? Please... Please, look, I was just trying to show off, I was just trying to... What makes you think it's right for you? Because I've got nothing else. That's not enough. In the Paras, if they come under sniper attack, but can't see where it's coming from, one of the group will volunteer to come out of cover and take a bullet so the others can see where the attack's coming from. It's a mind-set to sacrifice yourself to save the group. So are you here to serve and do your duty? Or are you here because you've got nothing else? I want to stay. Think about it and we'll discuss it in a few days. Go on. LAUGHTER INDISTINCT SPEECH That went off! No, no, just stick to the roads where the vehicle could have gone. Operator, this is Echo. Stick to the MSR. Your watch battery might have died and the vehicle been moved. Or they're holding her in one of the farm buildings. Mmm. That looks like a vehicle there - in the trees. Zoom in. It's the ambulance. Oh, bingo. But we have no intel Dr Bahil is even in that locale. It's the best intel we have in town, Sir. To be fair to Sergeant Lane, it's a line we should be pursuing. Sir? We received another video. ON VIDEO: Please. There isn't much time left. They need to know the elections will be halted. Please, they must be halted. You have until dawn. If there isn't time to wait for the Paras as back up... There clearly isn't, is there? ..we can go in with your guys in a supporting role, controlling the roads. Good. Good. Well done, Sergeant Lane. This is Omar's territory. Extremely remote and dangerous. It'll take a while for us to get there. And they might move her. We need eyes on. I've got a local man, but he's not the most reliable. PHONE RINGS Yeah, nah. Nae movement in or out. Yeah, yeah, bruv, I've got eyes on. The only way in or out is past me, fam, and I'm telling you - nowt. After this, yeah, you best get us back home, man, cos this food's making us ill. No, I mean proper ill in my guts. I'm shitting sand. Hello? Hello? Yeah, thanks, Sarge. Sir. Brigadier. Happy with the briefing? I want you to orchestrate operations with me from the Ops Room. Colour Sergeant King can handle it. I need to be with my guys. Don't make this awkward, Mr Hurst. Sir, I'm 100% on this mission. They're not going without me. Sir, for my two penn'orth... ..we need the bossman with us. Carry on, then, Lieutenant. MUSIC: Haul by Christian Loffler feat. Monha # It's far away... # Stolen, are they? Oi, this time tomorrow, you'll be on a beach with my sister. Blathered, babe. SHE SNORTS HE CHUCKLES I know I'm not the finished article yet, but I appreciate you bearing with me. Sir. Look, I don't know if I'm ever going to be as good as what's gone before me. It's a bastard living in the shadow of greatness. Yeah, you don't need to tell me. Just be yourself. HE WHISTLES HURST: Everyone, stay focused. The farm house is a potential Omar stronghold. Your watch? All call signs on me. We find Dr Bahil and we get out of here. OK. Go. WHISPERING: Move now. MULTIPLE BANGS Get down. Get down! Get down. Get down! INDISTINCT SHOUTING Get down on the floor! On the floor! Calm down, calm down! Breathe, breathe. Calm down, sir. Look at me. Look at me. The doctor's not here. Arms wide. Arms wide, sir. Medic! Medic! Saunders, on me. Lady, you move and I will shoot you. Hands up... Search the woman, she's hiding something under her robes. Arms up. Arms up. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Boss, we've got an issue! The lady's pregnant. Well, it weren't me. WOMAN WHIMPERS WOMAN GROANS Is everything OK? She's having contractions. SHE CRIES OUT I think the shock has bought on her labour. That is all you, bro. Is there anything we can do to help? She's had two kids already, so hopefully this one should just pop out. But do you know what? My mum said the more babies, the better when it comes to giving birth and she is a midwife so... Oh, thank God. Right, what do we do? What do you mean? You know what to do. How would I know what to do? I haven't got a clue. You're a Sergeant? Yeah, and we didn't exactly learn about childbirth in Sergeant training, did we? Do you need anything? Yeah, get us some towels. WOMAN GROANS OK, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Thank you. Breathe. Here you go. Shh. Shh. Hey, hey, hey! Easy. Hey, easy! Calm down. So that ambulance... Ambulance - nee-nah, nee-nah! ..you've never seen it before? Right, well. He says he knows nothing about an ambulance parked outside his pissing window! Do you recognise this woman? Boss, have a look at what I found. And there's a wee bit more where that came from. HE SHOUTS Hey, calm down. Sir, calm down. THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER OK. It's all right. What are you wanging on about? You cannot take that. Whatever you do, you have to leave that. Now he speaks English. You want us to leave what's got to be, like, £1 million worth of heroin which funds weapons to kill us? No chance, pal! I am begging you. Omar is coming to collect it in the morning and, if it is not there, he will kill my family. And not just my family, he will kill everybody in the area. All the farmers! That block is everybody's produce. They will collect it in the morning... We need to take this back to Zero and get back before first light. Please. Please, my friend. Please. Please! Mimi, if you've got any bright ideas, anything that your mother might have told you, now's the time to share. WOMAN MOANS Now is not the time to update your status, Saunders! WOMAN SCREAMS Yes, OK. Got it, got it, got it. We need to check how dilated the cervix is and, if it's more than 7-10cm, then that means that the baby's coming. Did you just Google that? No-one else had a better plan, so... OK. Right, I'm going in. Erm... I'm not going to.. I'm just going to stay at the head, yeah? Georgie. One minute. OK. Breathe. Breathe, breathe. How much longer is this going to take? We need to do a tactical retreat before Omar's team rock up. Look, she's in labour, all right? We have a duty of care for the patient. If we stay here, we die. WOMAN CONTINUES CRYING Georgie, I think her waters have just broken. Shitting hell, this never happened to Andy McNab. Right, slight change of plan. You're staying and so's that block of heroin. Hang on, why? Plan B. Your medics can't leave their patient yet. I'm hiding a tracker in that which hopefully will lead us to Omar and eventually Dr Bahil. We need to get everyone out by first light. I'm staying here with my guys. Boss. Boss. Let's send Delta and Golf fire teams back to zero. Oscar can stay here, concealed. Potential backup and a protection force for our medics. WOMAN SCREAMS All call signs on me. Golf, Delta make to the RV point and head to Zero, over. ON RADIO: Roger that, over. They will kill all. We need to put that block back wherever they're meant to pick it up from. They will find your tracker. It won't happen. That tracker will lead us to Omar and the hostage. Omar won't bother you again. You kill one Omar, ten more Omars come. Ever since I was child. Punished for taking a pen from a British soldier when I was seven years' old. You don't have to live in fear for the rest of your life. You can do something that helps make change. Or you can go screaming out that door, let Omar and his men know that we're here and watch them slaughter us, and sign up for no change. Live the rest of your life in perpetual fear. WOMAN MOANS WOMAN SOBS That looks OK. Next time, just keep your arms down by there. Head up. Keep concentrating on breathing. Breathe... Sarge. All OK, Mimi? I think so. I hope so. How long do these things generally, as a rule, take? Well, how long's a piece of string, Prof? I think this is going to take hours. You do know what you're doing though, yeah? Yeah. I don't mind what you're telling people, right? What do I tell people? I thought you said your mum was a teacher. That's what you said. But if she's not a midwife, you need to say. I don't know what you're talking about. If you're making stuff up in here, then it's going to affect... We've all Googled stuff, Prof, so I don't see how that matters. What I'm saying is we can be honest with each other. We need some privacy, OK? Yeah. WAILING IN BACKGROUND Well, I might as well change your dressings while we've got a moment. Well, have we got a moment? Mimi will shout me if she needs me. You all right? Yeah. Yeah? There you go. You know Elvis and I, we did a mission together in Estonia. I didn't know that. Well, I know what he felt about you. And I know... No, go on. I can take anything. Tell me. Well, all he wanted was a life with you. And he was trying to work out an exit strategy, because, well, this job and a happy family life, they don't exactly go hand in hand. SHE CHUCKLES No. No, they don't. And for him to die in a trap like that... What do you mean? What the fuck do you mean, Blue? Oh, shit. Blue? Omar was luring British soldiers into that building to kill them. Yeah, but we didn't know that. No, the authorities knew all about Omar. He should have been neutralised early doors, instead of letting him turn into this untouchable that he is now. Wait, wait. So he could have been killed earlier? He was a target that should have been nipped in the bud. WHISPERING: Oh, my God. And we weren't allowed to pursue him. But no-one kills a blade and lives to tell the tale. When you get him - Omar... ..are you going to bring him back to justice? MUSIC: Lost Without You by Freya Ridings No, it doesn't work like that. When we go in, our modus operandi is double tap. No recriminations, no appeals. Georgie... That's not justice. # I think I'm lost without you # I just feel crushed without you # Cos I've been strong for so long # I never thought how much I needed you # I think I'm lost without you. # What you up to? Just.... All the stars, eh? Freaky, innit? There's, like, billions. Have they got more stars here than in Lanzarote? They've got the same amount, Fingers. Yeah. Me and Marie are going to count... You all right? Georgie, what's up, man? Oh, fuck. I just I thought I had everything in this little box in my mind that I'd never have to open again. What do you mean, babe? Listen, I knew this was going to be hard. I did. But I just keep being reminded of Elvis, you know? He was so alive here. He is... He is so alive here. Thing is, I just miss him so fucking much. Come here. SHE SOBS I don't think I can do this any more, Fingers. I don't. It's all right. I can't... Don't crack up on us, Georgie. I can't. I can't. Come on, you're the grown-up, babe. Yeah? You're the one who's got their shit together. Come on. Come on. SHE SOBS Come on, you're Georgie Lane. All right? # And I said... # ..go. # Right, opium's back in place. Due to be picked up at approximately 0800. Tracker implanted. Your team on the roof. From your vantage point, you're our eyes. Need intel of movement. Update, medic? Well, these things take a lot longer than you think. Have you got an ETA? Well, she's fully dilated, so now-ish. Right, well, you'd better stay with your patient then, but keep noise to a minimum and low profile. OK. Lieutenant Hurst, all weapons and ammunition on you. If there's any contact, you're in pole position. Prepare for phase one. Roger that. Boss! OK. All focus, guys. Throbber? Colour. Focus. HURST: 4x4 en route, over. All call signs on me. Medics - not seen or heard, over. WOMAN CRIES OUT Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. You're all right. Roger. Out. That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it. Mimi. Mimi. There, go and stand with the kids. OK. GUN COCKS Shh, you need to...OK? I don't understand. He's coming towards the house. Shh, shh, shh. Boss. Do you reckon we're about to be sold down the Firth of Forth? Well, we're up shit creek without a spanner if he has. Hold your fire. I don't think that's supposed to happen. Indeed fucking not. WHISPERING: Mimi. I think he just said Omar, over. Think he's wanting to take him to Omar. Lane, stay with the family. WOMAN GROANS Boss, he's gone in. Stay in position, Fingers. If he goes upstairs... Stay in position. Focus. WOMAN GROANS AND PANTS Lieutenant Hurst, hold your position. Follow me. MOANING CONTINUES HE MUTTERS Lieutenant Hurst, if you've not heard from us in an hour, make to RV point and head to base, over. CAR DOOR SHUTS ENGINE STARTS Ha-ha! That's what I'm talking about. Phew! This is the last time that you get me into trouble, boss. Lightweight. WOMAN CRIES OUT OK, how are we doing? Prepare to abandon ship, boys. MUFFLED SPEECH OK, three, two, one. Omar is in the building. ON RADIO: Happy days, over. OK. That's it. CAR DOOR SHUTS Dr Bahil. ENGINE STARTS Go in loud. Now! Get your head down. No, no, no, no! No, sunshine. I can't tell you how much I've looked forward to meeting you. ON RADIO: Mike One Zero Alpha, this is Zero One Zero Alpha. Dr Bahil rescued alive. What about Omar? Was he there? Do you want me to do the honours, boss? Ain't happening. Wouldn't it be simpler all round if I double tap him now? Well, let's just say... ..I'm doing it for a friend. ON RADIO: Omar captured, alive if not well. SHE WAILS OK. Right, I can see the head. The baby's coming. Yeah? Yeah. ON RADIO: Mike One Zero Alpha. We think he's sent a truck loaded with explosives your way. You need to evacuate the farm house immediately. But the baby's already coming. Shit. PROF: I can see a vehicle approaching, sir. Let's get them out. Tallboy - kids. Throbber, on me. Another push. Baby's coming. WOMAN GROANS Georgie, we need to move you guys. What? No! No, no, no! We can't move her, the baby is coming out!
