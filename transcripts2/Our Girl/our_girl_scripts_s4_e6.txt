 [defibrillator whining] - [Antonio] Time of death, 8:49 - Is it true? Are you thinking about doing a deal with Omar and letting him off? It must make you angry. All those plans you had together, gone - Giti's gone. Her bed's empty, where is she? - She could have been taken anywhere. [Cheese speaks in foreign language]

 - What the hell went down with you and that old man? - You are an absolute psychopath, do you know that? - What are your little friends gonna say when they find out who you really are? - I found a file about Omar on Antonio's desk. He's known about Omar's deal this whole time. Because of you, I'm broken. - Something ain't right here. [singer vocalising] [ominous music] - [Brigadier] Today's election will go down as a significant turning point in Afghanistan's history. Their own highly trained security forces will ensure the democratic process passes without a hitch.

 Today also sees another platoon of Afghan National Army Cadets passing out. They are Afghanistan's future. - Left, right, left, right... - [Brigadier] The visiting dignitary, the group command colonel, will be welcomed by myself before he inspects the troops. - Left, right... - He will witness first hand how we are helping Afghanistan help itself. - [Commander] Right turn. - There will undoubtedly be insurgents who will be attempting to disrupt proceedings and halt the elections in any way they can. We shall not be found wanting. - We've trained long and hard for today. Stay focused, stay alert. Impeccable behaviour. - [Soldiers] Colour. - At 1500 hours the group command colonel, one of the highest-ranking officers in the United States Armed Forces, lands in Kabul by helicopter. He will travel by motorcade to the parade ground. And as part of a schedule of activity, he'll be visiting the barracks at 1521. - And be presented to the British, American and Afghan Brigadiers. - Before turning to inspect the troops, he will stop at the best student passing out, Cadet Poya. - Thank you, sir. - [Sandy] The Group Command Colonel will be here for nine minutes before carrying on to meet with the Governor of Kabul. [soldiers chattering] [suspenseful music] - It is strange, isn't it? - Mr. Hurst? - Well, just as we're here planning for every contingency, there'll be insurgents somewhere making plans of their own. Right now, there'll be bandits stood in a room staring at a map of Kabul, looking for our weakness. - There will be no weakness, correct, Second Lieutenant? - Sir.

How would it make the world any worse if we just pulled out and nuked the place? I mean, even Australia's got koala bears. What's this shit hole got? Nothing. - Don't know, just ignore him - Any eyes on Georgie? - Not like her to miss her breakfast. - It's not, is it? [soldiers chattering] - 'Ere, Saunders. - Where's he going? - What's the matter, don't like foreign beans? The silent treatment. Still, reckon it's quite a good idea. - Do you know what? Why don't you just keep away from me, all right? You've done enough damage already. - You say nothing, I say nothing. Don't forget our little deal. Oi, you, Charlie, looking for you. [soldiers chattering] [solemn music] - Yo, everything all right, Mimi? - Yeah. - What's he banging on about? - Who? - Cheese. - Uh, I don't know, I weren't listening. Something about beans. - Sarge? How you doing? - Omar. Do you think I should say something to someone? - What is there to say? That we impersonated American officers? That you've got an uneasy feeling about Omar? Hold your counsel until you know something concrete. I'm on your side. - I know why you're saying that. Because if I say something, then everyone will be like, "Yep, confirmed, she's lost it." - No one thinks you've lost it. - Right, so why did they send me for a psych assessment then? - You know why. - I'm of sound enough mind to be in the Army, unless I start running my mouth off. - Anyone who joins the army is a fruitcake, know that. - Have you heard of "Catch 22"? - Yeah, but I don't really understand it. - Right, well, it's a book. It's about the American Air Force. - Right. - If you were going out on a dangerous mission and you applied for exemption on the grounds of insanity, then you were clearly sane, so you had to do it. Whereas the insane who didn't apply, they still got to go anyhow. That's "Catch 22." - Heads I win, tails you lose. - Exactly, you got it. - The Army always wins. - Word of advice, keep your head down. - I know how to sort out all problems on election day and guarantee there'll be no deaths. - Does anybody have a clue about these elections? 'Cause I don't. - Go on, enlighten us. - Vote by phone, hm? Bosh, sorted, eh? I mean, if they can do it on "X Factor," you'd think they could sort it out over here. - Well maybe not everyone has a smart phone, Throbber. - I don't know anybody that doesn't. Mimi, do you know anyone that doesn't have a smart phone? - Obviously not. Snapchat, Insta... - Tinder. - Even my grandma's on Tinder. You know, she Super Liked me. Not quite sure she knows the rules yet. - I once pulled four birds in one day off Tinder. - Is that how you met Monk's grandma? - Ah! [laughing] [explosion booms] - Yo! - There you go, started already. The Afghan elections, Monk's grandma, Tinder, and back to the realities of war all within 17 seconds. [Cheese laughs] - There's gonna be carnage today, guys. Least let's hope so anyway, eh Throbber? Then we can go and sort those wrong'uns right out - Word in private please Sergeant Lane. - Sir. - What's happening, Monk? - In a bit, in a bit. Where's she off to? - Let's go to my office. - Come on, Kingy, put me out of my misery. - I know that's a psych report in there. I'm thinking, if it's bad news, you wouldn't have tapped the files the way you just did. Unless you're a heartless psychopath. - Got me sussed already, you're good. [both laugh] - Reinstated to full duties with immediate effect. - See, I knew, I knew you weren't a heartless psychopath. - Mm-hm. - And I'm sorry, you know. - No, no, spit it out. - That I thought you agreed with them, for me not being fit for duty. - If I'd have thought for one second you were wobbling, I'd have done more than just think you were unfit for duty, I would have called it in. - Really? - Oh, yeah, Abso-fucking-lutley. You got responsibilities, other people rely on us, and it would be a dereliction of my duties if I had doubts about you. - Well, I'm sane, it's official. [chuckles] - You've never been sane to be fair, Lane. - You're right, I wouldn't have enlisted otherwise. "Catch 22," eh? - So from now on, task in hand and only task in hand. - Colour. [ominous music] - Yes. Come, it's time. [crowd chattering] [suspenseful music] [children laughing] [explosion booms] [eerie music] - Right, so how many on your lists are needing to stay in overnight? - Have you got a moment, sir? - Yeah, yeah, we just finished. Thank you, doctor. Hello, stranger, nice to see you. How you been? - Yeah, I'm back on full duties. - That's great news, I couldn't be happier for you. - Did you know about Pakistan? - I'm sorry? - No, don't "I'm sorry" me when you lied. You signed Omar off as fit to travel. You knew Omar was gonna get whisked off to some interrogation unit in Pakistan never to be heard or seen again. - Just hold on a second. There was no lying or shielding you from the truth. I was asked to medically assess Aatan Omar, and as a doctor I did my duty. - So why didn't you say anything to me? - Because there was nothing to say, I didn't know anything for definite. - You were seeing the psych. [Georgie chuckles] What could I have told you that I didn't actually know myself, for certain? - Look, I only ever done what's best for you. Which includes not telling anyone you borrowed my pass. - I needed to look at him in the eye. - Yeah, well, you seem to have rattled him. - Have I? [ominous music] - Now look, we need to be able to trust each other. - We do. - Well, tell me what you know. Stop censoring everything you say. I can see the cogs turning. There's more, isn't there? - He's called Military Intelligence in to make a full confession. - And what can he confess to that we don't already know? - You might not swallow this one. - Go on. - He's now saying he's not in fact Omar but rather a stooge. The SEALs and your special forces have been hunting a ghost across the mountains for two years, while the real Omar is somewhere else, directing operations. - [Georgie] I knew it. - Hey, that is extremely sensitive intel, by the way. Only those on a need to know basis. - Do any of my guys know? - Only those that need to know. - I'm so grateful. [suspenseful music] Thank you. - Whenever my kids used to hover in the doorway like that, it was either they wanted more money or were about to be expelled. Oft times, both. - Suicide bomb gone off at a polling station. Second one today, sir. - Aware. The Americans have called for all public transport to be halted... - If that isn't Omar that we have in our cells, sir, and he's still at large masterminding these attacks, then surely, sir, our resources can be better utilised in Kabul, helping the ANA prevent any of these further atrocities, rather than the dignitary meet and greet here at the camp. - No, I'm meeting the Colonel. Will that be all? - Thank you for listening, sir, and I'm sure you'll give it due consideration. [singer singing in foreign language] - It's haunting, isn't it, the call to prayer? - Ay it though. - Anybody who says it's not a kind of beautiful sound isn't listening to it properly. Listen. - I can't hear anything, Prof. - Silence has a sound. - Boom! What a bunch of pussies you lot are. I didn't join the Navy by mistake, did I? - Thoughts? One bad apple, yeah? - I'm just here to do my job. [sighs] I ain't getting involved. - Prof, a word. - Go on. [door slams] - I heard certain intel from American Military Intelligence. - You mean Antonio. - Look, I'm not supposed to say, but the person we have in custody is now saying he's not Omar, but a stooge put in place so Omar can carry on directing operations. Look, I knew something wasn't right about him. What did I tell you, I called it right from the off. - He's bound to say that, isn't he? "Are you Omar?" "Oh, who guv, what guv, me guv?" - What are we gonna do? - About what? - About Omar not being Omar. - About Omar saying he's not Omar. He's not exactly the most trustworthy dude in town, is he? - Prof. - What? - What's gotten into you? [ominous music] - Intel suggests that Kabul Hospital is the next likely target. Dr. Bahil requires round the clock protection, so I'm moving Saunders and Poya over there to assist. - Sir, I'm meeting the dignitaries. - Not any more. - Sir, I could go to the hospital while Poya... - No, I need you here supervising your platoon. Any further questions? - Sergeant Lane. - Sir, do we know who exactly who's behind these bombings? I mean the one at the polling... - Let's all stick to the appropriate task in hand. Dismissed. - [Georgie] Take care, Mimi. - [Mimi] Well, the hospital's gonna be about the safest place. - Yeah, like the polling stations. You keep your wits about you, okay? - Yeah, I'll be fine, I got Poya to keep me safe. Come on, let's get going. Come on. - Oi, oi, listen. I'm being serious, Saunders, okay? You stay focused, you stay alert, you stay alive, okay? - Yeah. [solemn music] - You all right, Poya? [door pounding] - Change of plan, post bombings, we're helping Dr. Bahil in the emergency room. Let's go. [engine revving] [dramatic music] ♪ Sink or swim ♪ Life and limb ♪ Heads or tails - Are you worried about anything? - I'm not worried. - Well, you look worried. - No, that is my face. [Mimi laughs] - I mean, to be fair, I did used to get that all the time in school, 'cause apparently I always used to look puzzled. [laughs] God, I hated school. - Was it in Kabul, your school? You born around here? - Lashkar Gah. - I bet you were a right teacher's pet, weren't you? [laughs] Did all the teachers love you? - It wasn't a good time for me. My parents needed me to work on the farm. - You don't need to worry about any of that anymore. - Yeah, you're safe with us, Poya. - I mean it, you're my mate, you are. When we get home I might even follow you on Insta. Ooh. [chuckles] [dramatic music] So, what did you grow? Thank you. - [Poya] When? - On your farm, on your parents' farm? - It used to be melons and pomegranates. We even had some walnut trees. - Walnut trees? Walnuts grow on trees? - [Poya] Of course. - [Mimi] Oh my days, I never knew that. - But since the war, just poppies. - So your, do your parents still have the farm? What happened? - There was a bombing at my brother's funeral. Killed them all. [dramatic music] [helicopter roaring] - Minutes away, guys. - Here come the big knobs. - The Septics love a bit of self importance. - I want you to be my business partner when we leave the army, Prof. - [scoffs] With your brains and my looks? - You slightly top him on both. - Seriously, Dragon's Den, [exhales] we'd sweep up. - Go on, what's our business? - Undertakers, Kabul. - You know, Throbber, that's not even funny, mate [Throbber laughs] - At teacher training, we were told to encourage kids to express themselves. - [Kingy] Eyes front. - I now realise just how wrong that was. - Sergeant Lane, important day. Let's try not to spoil it with silly behaviour. [helicopter roaring] [dramatic music] - Tertiary blast injuries, thrown into the air and landed on his back, no sensation in his legs. - And how many bombings have there been this morning? - Most injuries from the polling station. A few other explosions. - Haven't you got election duties? - Too late. - What's too late? - I have too much to do in this real world to worry about anything else. - The elections are real. - Or just a real waste of time. - What are you talking about? - The Taliban are going to seize control, aren't they, when you're all gone. The new Taliban is all about peace talks and solar panels, bringing irrigation to the farms, electricity in the rural communities, education for all. - Hang on a second, the Taliban? What's going on with you right now? - When you've all gone and we're alone, they're going to be the ones in power. By fighting them, aren't we just delaying the inevitable? Causing more harm? - Well you try telling that to the guy they're wheeling into surgery that they're the good guys. - I don't believe in anything anymore. Listen, everybody has been thoroughly searched half a dozen times before they've arrived on the ward. Come, come. - We are looking after you today, Dr. Bahil, okay? - Thank you. - Come through. To go to this bed here. - Let's get this lady on a saline drip and some antibiotics. - Okay, well, I'll grab some from the cool store. - I'll go. - Okay, sure. - [Dr. Bahil] Let's get her on the bed. Make her comfortable. [suspenseful music] - En route, sir. - [Brigadier] Shall we? [suspenseful music] - Poya, if you can take these blast bandages onto the ward. What's the matter? - Did you find it? What's going on here? Haven't interrupted anything, have I? [Mimi chuckling] - Yes, go away. - Okay, okay, okay, um, Poya. Don't do anything, okay, just stay really still. - I only have to press this button. - I know. I know that. All I'm saying is you don't have to. - I do, for a new Afghanistan. - But blowing up a doctor, isn't that just like the old Afghanistan? - You've come here and destroyed. - Have I? Me, how? Poya, I'm over here doing the same that you are. I'm a medic. - Be quiet. - We're friends, Poya, I was gonna come and see your farm. - There is no farm anymore! Everything is gone. - You haven't, you haven't gone. You have got a life... - We need to stop people like you and this American. - I'm not American. - This isn't America, this is our country! We don't want any of you here, none of you! - Don't do this, Poya. - Everything is a lie, Mimi. Dr. Antonio pretending to help, all the time pointing out houses for the Americans to destroy. - What do you mean, Poya? - They've came to my house, too, American medics pretending to help, but they're there to search for targets. - Antonio isn't doing that. - He's there to tell them where the Taliban are, and then they'll bomb. - Was it the Americans that struck at your brother's funeral? - Of course. - Antonio wouldn't do that. - I've seen it with my own two eyes. He's not there as a doctor, he's there as a spy. [suspenseful music] - Welcome, sir, this way, please. - [Brigadier] We are proud to welcome on this historic day... - [Poya] You must leave, go. - I'm not going anywhere, Poya, I'm staying with you. - You must be away from me, Mimi, please. - Go, Mimi. - No, no, no, I'm staying with you, you let Dr. Bahil go. - I'm staying, too. Maybe I can make things better by dying. Maybe, Poya, you'll be making a martyr of me. - Oh, no, no, no, no... - If I'm not to be elected, maybe this is what my destiny was, to die for Afghanistan. - I'm dying for Afghanistan. - Poya, no one will care about your death. - I will. - Go, Mimi, please. - No. I don't have a family, Poya. My mum gave me away when I was a baby because she didn't want me. I was actually born addicted to heroin because she was an addict, and we've never met because she doesn't want any contact. - Get out, get out. - I don't know who my dad was. - Go, let's move. - Maybe he was from Afghanistan, but I don't really know. But when I was about four, this couple adopted me, and they were gonna be my forever family, you know. But about a year later she got pregnant and I think that's, well, I guess why that's, that's why they sent me back to care. I pretend that I've got a family. - Get back, stay there. - And I pretend that they love me, and actually, I've got no one, either, Poya. - Go, go, go. - Okay, okay. - Move in. - They've killed all my family. - Back it up, move! - Faster. - I've nothing to live for but revenge. - No, no, you, you've got me. You have got me, and we can sort this out. - Let's go. - No, no. - Look at me, just keep very still. Take your thumb off, Poya. [suspenseful music] Move it away from the button. [gun fires] - Poya, Poya! - Get them out of here right now and into a safe zone. - Poya! - Alert bomb squad. I want this whole wing evacuated right now. Let's go. - No, no, no! - Alert the bomb squad, let's move out, go. - Please just stop, no, please, Poya, Poya! Get off me, get off me, get off! - Sir, attempted suicide bombing at the hospital, ANA soldier. - Please do follow me, sir. - What do we do? - If it was my call, I'd abort until we can identify who it was and any possible associates. - On me, Colour. Sir, we need the dignitaries back into the safe zone of the vehicle whilst the situation... - It's a suicide bomber. - Until it's been resolved. - Move back into the ranks, Mr. Hurst. - Sir, it's an ANA attack at the hospital. Sirs, we need you into the safe zone right now, please. - Exactly, everyone into the vehicle, now. [gun firing] - Move, move! - Contact! - Move, move! - [Kingy] Man down, man down! [soldiers shouting] - Put your weapon down, Throbber, Cheese! - [Kingy] Everybody stay down! - Contact! - Men! - Man down! - Everybody stay down! - [Kingy] Lower your weapon! - Let's go. - Take his gun off him, take his weapon off him. - [Kingy] Everybody stay down, stay down! - Okay, all right. [suspenseful music] - [Monk] Rabee, where are you? [gun fires] - [Rabee] I'm in here! - [Monk] Rabee, Rabee, are you okay? Stand back! - Don't shoot, don't shoot! I'm okay, I'm okay. - My friend, how could he do that? I had no choice. - Are you you good, are you okay? - I'm okay - You're not hit? - No. - He's dead. - [Rabee] Ugh, I can't believe it. - [Monk] You did good, Rabee. [siren blaring] [solemn music] - [Kingy] Go back to your barracks, quick as you can. Go, come on! [soldiers chattering] - [Georgie] The ambulance is here. - That's right? - Yeah. - [Antonio] Building's clear. Well done, Saunders. - [Mimi] Pardon, sir? - You got him to take his thumb off the button, gave me a clear shot. - You didn't need to do that. He wasn't gonna do it. He understood, he was my friend. [solemn music] [soldiers chattering] - Right, I want everyone searched. We need to find out where that gun came from, and let's make sure there are no more weapons unaccounted for. Are you okay, Rabee? - I don't know what happened. Zarek just suddenly lost his mind. I'll escort these two to Role Three. - You sure you don't need time out? - I'm fine, we have work to do. [ominous music] [attendants chattering] [ominous music] - Excuse me. - What's happened? How is she, how's Mimi? - Sketchy info at the moment but as I understand it, suicide bomber neutralised, hospital in lockdown. - So synchronised attacks. - Let's wait for the facts to become clear, okay? Dignitaries are safe back at Kabul Airport. - Well, they didn't hang around to see how their security detail were, did they? - Yeah, well. - You're gonna get mentioned in "Dispatches," Rabee. - Ah, we're all just doing our duty. - Two Cat As, we could have been a blood bath. - Transport and security have been organised. I can go down to Kabul hospital, escort Poya and Saunders back. I can also work on close security for Dr. Bahil. - Get that squared away with your OC. - Permission to be a part of that detail, Colour. Duty of care to Saunders, I need to check her out and bring her back with me. Prof can be support, he can drive. Please, Kingy. - Full combats, straight back, let's leave the ANA to work out of the hospital. - Sergeant. - A word in your ear. Extremely disappointed, Mr. Hurst. - Sir? - This is not the way things were supposed to have panned out. - All ANA soldiers now are confined to quarters, sir. - Good. - Thank God Rabee acted that quickly. Can you imagine the damage he could have done? - I don't know who I can trust anymore. [singer vocalising] [dramatic music] - Anyone see Dr. Bahil? No, have you seen her? Dr. Bahil, seen her? Anyone know where she is? Why didn't you answer your phone? - Out of charge. - Ah, terrific. I've just aged 20 years looking for you. You need to stay close. - Poya. - What about him? - He was talking about you. - Nurse? I had to shoot him, you do realise that, don't you? - Oh yes, you're a soldier first. - Meaning? Okay, he was erratic, could have pushed that button at any moment, would have taken out half the hospital. - You've been calling things in. When we're on outreach medical duties, you've been reporting suspicious behaviour back to Military Intelligence. - What are you talking about? - Don't lie to me, I know. - I've been by your side as a doctor. - By my side as a doctor, and as soon as you're back at the base? - I'm only about saving lives, okay? - Oh, really? - Yes, really. If I happen see a cache of weapons, what do you expect me to do? - You were there in a medical capacity. No wonder they won't trust us. "The Americans are there as spies, to gather information." They were right all along. - Hey, I see, I see a cache of arms. What do you expect me to do, huh? You think I shouldn't call it in, when you claim to be about saving lives, huh? - The harm you've done. - Oh please, I'm on the side of the good here, doing what I think is right. And I am sick and tired of sending our men home in body bags. - We need to be able to go out into the field as medics and be trusted by the people, or we've lost. I'm going to vote. [solemn music] - [Throbber] What must we have looked like, two proper bad boys with straps. - [Monk] Yeah, Batman and Robin, mate. - [Throbber] Which one am I? - Well, I got there first, which I think you'll find makes me officially Batman. - Would you have took a bullet for them? - Ah, I'd have took one for Kingy, especially when I saw his little legs come hurrying over, I thought I'd better get involved. - Ay it though. I'd have run over and took a bullet for you, you know. - Your big fucking head would have given us all cover. - Lot of brain to keep warm, mate. - Actually, you're not as thick as what I thought. - Cheers pal, means a lot. - You taking the piss? - Yep. - Ere Lads, all the Afghans have been confined to their quarters, reckon we should slip in a cheeky little CS gas canister, don't you? That should sort them out. - To be fair, think you were the first one to suss out Cheese. - What about him? - Bloke's a dickhead. - You know the other day when we was on patrol and the old fella got lamped? Well, Cheese cracked him in the head with his weapon. Nearly fucking killed the guy for no reason. He ain't just a dickhead, he's a wrong'un. [ominous music] [singer vocalising] [receiver beeping] - Sarge, someone's trying to through. - Send. - Lane, where are you? - En Route, sir. - Hospital suicide attacker. It was Poya. I thought you should know. - Roger that, affirmative, out. [receiver beeps] [ominous music] - Who was that? - Kingy. - What did he want? - Checking on our ETA. - Why did he want to know that? - Just drive, Prof. [singer vocalising] - Yeah. - Why aren't you on the gate? - Lieutenant Hurst just stood us down, Colour. - Yeah, three section have taken over. - Boss says it was Poya, the suicide bomber at the hospital. - What, are you being serious? - Prof and Georgie have just gone off with Rabee, Colour. If Zarek and Poya was rogue, surely Rabee would have known? - Well, he's gotta be rogue and all, Colour. - Right, you two, on me. [dramatic music] - [Georgie] Left here, Prof. - [Prof] What, why? - [Georgie] Just turn left, Prof. - [Prof] Where are we going, Georgie? We've lost our lead vehicle. - Right, Prof, stop. - Sarge, what's going on? - We shouldn't stop, we need to get to the hospital. - It was Poya. - What? - The attempted suicide bomber at the hospital, it was Poya. - Poya? That can't be right. - I've just been informed. - No, there's been a mistake. Poya was at the hospital, yes, but... - He's dead. - Dead? - He was wearing a suicide vest. Killed before he could detonate it. - No, there must have been some kind of mistake. I can't believe that. Poya, our friend Poya? - So when Poya got sent to the hospital, you got Zarek to take his place, didn't you? - What the fuck you taking about, Georgie? - We need to get to the hospital and get your medic back to base. Drive on, soldier. - No Prof, we're staying here. - Drive on as instructed! - See that building there? That's where my fiance was killed by Omar. Do you know about that? - Delta 1 to Bravo, over. Delta 1 to Bravo, over. Delta 1 to Bravo, over. - Oi! - [Georgie] Prof, he's got my weapon, call it in. - Georgie, what you doing? [gun firing] Outside the cement factory, Kabul Rushee district, Sergeant Lane in pursuit of insurgent. Wait out. - Colour, we need to get to the cement factory, now. - [Monk] Delta 1 to Bravo. We're approaching the cement factory now. Where are you? Please advise, over. Delta 1 to Bravo, come in, over. - [Kingy] There's their vehicle, stand by. - [Monk] Delta 1 to Zero. Alighting in pursuit of suspect. Wait out. [Georgie panting] - On me. [suspenseful music] [gun knocks] - Right. Before you shoot me, you tell me the truth. You're guilty. - Guilty, who is guilty? Who is innocent? - If you're working for Omar, then you're guilty. You're in with the people who killed my fiance. - He was an enemy soldier, sent here to kill my people. A legitimate target. He went onto that roof to kill as many of my men as he could. - Who told you this? - And when he found that bomb, - I was the one who signalled for them to detonate. [dramatic music] [explosion booms] [dramatic music] - You did? Oh my God, you're Aatan Omar. - [Prof] Hold your fire! [guns firing] - Prof, Prof! Here, I've got you. Prof! - [Monk] Shots fired. [Poya wheezes] [soldiers chattering] - He got hit. - What's going on? - Look after him, get this off. - You trying to win a medal? - All right, that's it, breathe. - I've got you, Prof. [Georgie panting] [Rabee groans] - When he was blown off that building, I rejoice! It makes no difference. Kill me, someone else will replace me. Someone more committed, more determined. Kill me, I win. Let me live, you lose. - It's catch 22, innit? - Kill me! [solemn music] Kill me! - Where's the justice in that? Throbber. [Throbber shouts] - Ah! [screaming] - Shut up, shut up! I trusted you, I thought you were one of us! - Monk, Monk. - [Kingy] Hello Zero, this is Delta 5 requesting... - Georgie, I can't breathe. - Location [speaking faintly] District. - You're okay, you're all right. You okay? [Prof whimpers] - [Announcer] With Kabul fielding the highest number of female candidates, these elections draw to a close and the count is now underway. As one candidate said, we must give the children hope for a better tomorrow. [singer vocalising] [soldiers chattering faintly] - Shit a brick, it's Thelma and Louise. - Old boy from the village, he's put in a complaint against you. - And I'm gonna support him as a witness. - What, you'd shit on one of your own? - You're ain't one of our own, you're a wrong'un. - Lads, cut me a bit of slack here, okay? He came at me, didn't he, Throbber? - No. - Yeah, you're out on your ass on this one, son. - And the head cam footage is with Lieutenant Hurst. - What fucking head cam footage? - One of the Afghan's. Thing is, bro, no one likes you. - Charlton, my office, right now. [gentle music] - See you later. - [Antonio] Hey. - Hey. - I've got some news for Private Saunders about Giti, the young girl from the mountain village. - Yeah? - Her and her uncle have come back to the hospital for antibiotics. - And they trust you, do they? [Antonio chuckles] - Look, all I've ever done is do what's right. You must get that, as a soldier and a medic. I reckon you'd have made the same call. - Do you? - I'm heading back to New York. I feel I'm damaged goods over here. And my mother doesn't want me to miss another Thanksgiving. - Well, you Americans have got a lot to be thankful for. - I might be in London for a conference in the fall, maybe I'll see you then? - I live in Stockport, it's quite far. - Can we at least part friends? - Colleagues. - [Dr. Bahil] No lives to save, Dr. Antonio? - Just on my way. - Congratulations, I hear. - Nothing official yet, but it'll be announced soon. - Well, they couldn't hope for anyone better. - Let's hope I live long enough to make a difference. - [Georgie] Of course you will. - I'll still be working at the hospital. - Good. - Thank you, Georgie. [singer vocalising] - Excuse me, I need to see someone. [solemn music] - Hello. - Hi. - Thank you. Oh. - Have you updated your status to war hero yet? - Ha, ha. I've deleted all that social media bollocks. - Ah, moved on? - You don't really move on, do you, as such. You reassess the past. - Rewrite history? - No, you don't rewrite history, you rewrite the present as you live it, convincing yourself that everything is just perfect. - The Instagram generation. - Mm-hm. We're all told to live these perfect lives, aren't we? And we don't. We pretend. - That's exactly like me. Sorry, I wasn't... - [Georgie] It's okay. - Um, [clears throat] I've been lying to you guys. [gentle music] Well, I've actually been lying my whole life, if I'm being honest, but, um, I'm actually just a looked after kid. I was brought up in a care home. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, whether you like it or not, you guys are my family now. I'll take this. - I'll... I didn't realise quite how cute you were without them. Mm. [chuckles] [gentle music] - Mimi, I didn't want to say in there, all right? But between us, just got off the phone to Marie. - What? - She's nine weeks pregnant. - Oh my God, we're gonna have a little baby Fingers? - Yeah. [laughs] - Oh, Congratulations! - I know. - Oh. No, but listen, shh. - All right, all right. - Okay? - Yeah. [chuckles] - [Throbber] You good? - Yeah, I'm fine. Um, what are you doing? [chuckles] - Love my food, me, eh? - Really? - Mm. It's in my genes. - What, um, what are your genes? - Well, I'm 25% Jamaican, 25% Chinese, 25% Ukrainian, and 25% yam yam. - And 100% twat, that's what you are. [Throbber laughs] - You ever been to Wolves before? - Well, not intentionally, no. - Hmm, well, I might have to take you to the Mander Centre on our R & R. - Oh, sounds magic. [gentle music] - [Kingy] Throbber. - What have I done now, Colour? - How do you think you've done on this tour, Throbber? The amount of times I've asked myself why the fuck is Throbber here, and now I know. - 'Cause you're a bloody good soldier. - Really, Colour? - Really, Throbber. - I've been trying to tell you that the whole bloody time, you just never listen. - Hey, there is our, what are you doing? [all laughing] - There he is. - Good. - Hey. - How are you? - Hey, yo. - Is he all mended, medic? - It was a scratch. - How are you Kingy? - Yeah. - Watch his arm. - Shitting hell, is that a bed pan or are you just pleased to see me, Prof? [all laughing] - What, what are you... - No, oh, God. - I'm always pleased to see you lads. - Can I just say a quick word, guys, while you're all gathered? You lot are never gonna leave me. Thank you. - You're a proper sweetheart, are you. - Sir. - Yes, sir. [all chuckling] - Hey, why do they call you Throbber? - That's his actual name. - [Georgie] Have you heard his actual name? - Kaine Wolfe. - [laughs] Yeah. - Fucking ridiculous. [all laughing] - He's lying. - It is what it is. - I've have royal blood, lad. I loved it, you just flew. - Is he actually being serious? - On me, Colour. [soldiers chattering] - On the mend? Private Grant? - Prof, indeed. Thank goodness, Brigadier, he'll be coming home with us. - A special dinner in honour of my valiant efforts on parade day, you're my plus one. - Your efforts, sir? - We all played our parts of course, Colour. But someone's has to lead. 19:00 hours, Mr. Hurst. - Thank you, sir. But I've promised the lads makeshift karaoke session to celebrate their efforts. - Someone's got to follow. Sir. [solemn music] - This place, Afghanistan. - Mm, as a child I used to be fascinated with it. I used to look up the maps and wonder whether one day. [chuckles] - It's a mess, though, innit? I mean, we all wish it wasn't, but it is. - We should never have gone in. You know, after the Twin Towers. We should never have gone in. And once we had gone in, we should never have left. - Some people can never leave. Elvis is here. So kite flying apparently is like a massive thing here in Afghanistan. - [Prof] Yeah, like footy in the UK. - [Georgie] [chuckles] No, I think kite flying's much more civilised. - [Prof] Perfect conditions for it. - [Georgie] Yep. - You know, my grandma died on Christmas Eve one year. I was ten. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Mum tried to carry on and make Christmas Christmas for us kids. And we had all my grandma's Christmas presents under the tree. She got me a kite. I remember we took it out on the reccy after the Queen's speech, a strong wind and the strings snapped. And it just flew up higher and higher, and my mum said, "It's flying all the way to heaven." [gentle music] - All the way to heaven. - Exactly. ♪ Now I lie ♪ In the lunar light ♪ Why don't you break down ♪ Break down for me ♪ Out in the dark times [lighthearted music] - "To see a world in a grain of sand "and heaven in a wild flower, "hold infinity in the palm of your hand "and eternity in an hour." - [Georgie] Is that some clever way of asking me out for a drink when we get back home? - Yeah. - Good.
