 Bashira? That's a lovely name. I'm Molly. You do not involve yourself in the lives of the locals. Her father, Badrai, sent her to spy. We're soul sisters. Am I going to die? Move! Where have they taken her, sir? They're willing to help remove Bashira from her family and into a safe house in Kabul. Come back to me. I will.

 - Fate's thrown us together. - Captain James? Me and you. Why can't you just be my mate? Because I love you. Nothing happened with Smurf. - At least now I know. - What are you trying to say, Dawes? Do you love me? They beat me with rocks because... I wouldn't kill someone. Kill who, Sohail? Man down! Man down! One Cat A, urgent medevac required! Wait out. Stay with me, OK? You're gonna be all right, I'm gonna get you out of here. Just stay with me, OK? Stay with me.

 Come on, stay with me! Stay with me! Because you're tucked up snug and safe in Bastion, does not mean you are no longer real soldiers, dig in! Give us a lift, boss. You'd only be cheating yourself, Dawes. Oh, by the way... the last one over the finish line is on latrine clean! Now, come on! Oi, runners! If this is all the effort you're gonna put in, we can do a 5k run every morning and a 10k run every evening until you do not look like the unfit rabble you look today. Can we remember we are the British Army? The last soldier past me is gonna be on latrine clean! Very clever, 2 Section, indeed! Think our work here is almost done. Oh, that backfired! My hands stink of... You know what they say? - A job shared is a job halved. - Boys... I reckon we've got another month of Bastion before decompression and home. I'm gutted we're pulling out, man. I want another tour! There's still Taliban out there. Still Badrai out there. Where do you reckon he's hidden himself, Molls? What are you asking me for? All that time I spent writing my death letter and no one'll be able to read it! You sound gutted, Mansfield. In my death letter home, yeah, I told them I wanted one of them eco-friendly wicker casket basket thingies. Can you stop talking about dying? My mum's shitting me up enough as it is. Why? She just wrote to me. Had a premonition. Thinks something bad's gonna happen. Shut up, Smurf, lad! Go to sleep! I'm being serious, boys! Chill out, Smurf, mate. She was right about Geraint. Night-night, Smurf. War Rages On ♪ The war rages on 4 You'll be at my side ♪ Through it all 4 Through hardships unseen ♪ We still survive ♪ Fortified - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. Just wanted to let you know, after Sohail's murder and other intel received, Badrai is very much on the Americans' radar. - What do you mean? - They need him caught. And will be doing all in their considerable power to support the ASF and get him caught. He's pretty much top of their wanted list. Really? Yeah. American Intelligence have a dossier that... Well, it makes for pretty shocking reading. He's pretty high up their network. He's not just some lightweight ten-dollar Taliban. He's proper. Right. So the boss and I spoke to Major Morley. American Intelligence? Any mission will involve you. You're the only person who's eye-balled Badrai. You'll be needed to positively ID him. Are you happy with that? Yeah, it'll be my absolute pleasure, boss. OK. We'll let you know when you're needed. Better go grab some breakfast while you can. You coming to watch the volleyball? It's us against the Yanks. I dunno if I can. What are you doing? Just got other duties and stuff. What other duties? Smurf, I'll come if I can. Don't worry about what your mum said. You've got a face like a slapped arse. The 50 Sausage Challenge! Goon! 50 sausages in 50 minutes. Come on, mate, you can do it. Ready? Three, two, one... Coming to watch the volleyball, Qaseem? You're basically a Brit now. - No, I'm basically not. - It was supposed to be a compliment, mate. Really? - No pleasing some people, is there? - I'm very happy being an Afghan. Eggy said you're out of here, your contract's finished. I'm going back to Kabul. Is that good? I'm ready. Is Kabul ready for you? When this is all over... can I come and visit you in Kabul? I know the subtext. I don't even know what that means. It means you want to visit Bashira. I just hope that she's all right. You never know what her dad's gonna do, and if he does anything to that little girl... Badrai won't hurt her. You mustn't worry about Bashira. People are looking after her, I'm sure. I just wanna help. - You have done. - Have 1? Yes. I dunno. Come on, man! - Come onl! - Yes! I'll be back in a minute. Sometimes, I don't know how I'm able to keep my hands off you. Ditto. Ditto? Bleeding "ditto"? I was expecting something a bit more romantic than "ditto". We agreed we'd wait out. I am waiting out, aren't I? I'm obeying your orders, boss. We haven't actually done anything, so... I need to stay focused... get you guys home in one piece. You're in my charge. If this is a mistake, then just say. What do you mean, "mistake"? If you're regretting it... us and...me. You should get ready. They think they've located Badrai. Afghan Special Forces are waiting for you. ♪ To let myself go ♪ To let myself flow ♪ Is the only way of being ♪ There's no use telling me 4 There's no use taking a step back ♪ A step back, for me Ready? I'm shitting myself, boss. - It'll be OK, I promise. - I can do this on my own. I'm not letting you out of my sight. ♪ To let myself go ♪ To let myself flow ♪ It's the only way of being ♪ There's no use telling me 4 There's no use taking a step back ♪ A step back, for me Wait out. These two? This one? No. - It's not him. - Please look. It's not Badrai. He's not here, boss. Please...don't hurt him! Are you all right? Yeah. Never been better, boss. Well, if you will go out on these secret missions. Jealous? You bet! You're off like some superhero and I'm left indoors with antiseptic wipes to clean up afterwards. What superhero do you know that's that slow they get a clump to the cake hole? Our neighbour used to have this little sign on his mantelpiece: "Never trouble trouble, till trouble troubles you." Oh, right. I never knew what it meant till I met you. What does it mean? The rest of us keep our heads down. But you're, like, "Oi, trouble, come and have a go if you think you're hard enough!" - It ain't like that, Jack. - It seems that way to me. I'd prefer to be indoors with the antiseptic wipes but it never really works out like that. You never look for trouble, but trouble just seems to find you, Molly Dawes. Exactly. Despite reliable intel on his whereabouts, Badrai has evaded us again. We're ready to start questioning the three detainees. We'll see what intel that yields. We find him. Imperative. It's likely he has a sizeable cache of explosives with him from the factory, which from past experience, we know he won't hesitate to use. Sir, as Dawes is the key to the successful apprehension of Badrali, can I suggest next time a joint operation? Agreed. I can't believe he weren't there. We've just put a bomb factory and several insurgents out of action. We have. Now let's complete the mission. Molls? - Don't worry, I can take a punch. - All right, Molly? - What happened? - Has someone clumped you? Don't be silly, I was joking. I fell off the running machine at the gym. Ah, silly girl! How big a twat did I feel in a room full of septic tanks? You haven't asked what the volleyball score was. - That's because I don't give a toss. - We came second. You look pig sick, Mansfield. He has just eaten a whole pig. I'm going vegetarian as soon as I get home. - Sorry! - Right in the kidney! I need bodies to unload a truck. Anyone? Anyone? Just you, Dawes? OK, let's go. A job shared is a job halved...or something. Yeah, cool, mate. It ain't gonna be me. Moll! What really happened? - I told you. - The truth. Moll, I know I ballsed it up between us at the fob. But your friendship means so much to me. I need you in my life. I am in your life, Smurf. That's what makes it bearable. I ain't just saying this to make you feel better but you really are a fucking top bloke. Really? Don't sound too surprised. I need you in my life too. There, I said it. Now, shut your hole and let's crack on. - Mates. - Best mates! Don't push it. Now, what really happened to your face? Mission to capture Badrai. It didn't really go as planned. - You and the boss man? - And the ASF. He's still out there. - We felt guilty! - No, we didn't. We just didn't trust you two alone. Eh, man? Whoo! What are they gonna do with all this kit in Cyprus, anyway? Get the poor sods deployed out there to unload it, then stack it somewhere else. Then reload it into another container when we're deployed to Africa. That's where Brains reckons it'll kick off next. Central African Republic. Mark my words. Where's that, then? Central Africa...you penis face. Charming! You all right? Smurf, stop asking me if I'm all right. The minute I'm not all right, I'll let you know. I can understand why that guy clumped you now. Jokes. Good 'un. If my old girl's right...I'll never get to see Vegas. Your old girl ain't gonna be right. Great, so we're going to Vegas? I walked into that one, didn't 1? That is the dress I'm getting you. Classy! Imagine how good you'll look on my arm wearing that. I'm not gonna be on your arm, you're gonna be 20 paces behind me. Are you ashamed to be seen out with me? Mortified, mate! You'd better cheer up before we go to the chapel to see Elvis. There's only two things wrong with that, Smurf. I ain't marrying you and Elvis is dead. Dead? Aww...break it to me slowly! I didn't even realise he was ill. You lot were supposed to be working. - Sorry, sir. - Boys, come on. What's the matter with you? We're doing it. Dawes? They need you now. There'll be nothing left of the place soon. Not long. You looking forward to going home, boss? Nope. Mansfield wanted to stay in the fob forever. Well, if you find a moment where you feel happy... You or Mansfield? They're waiting for us in the detention facility, Dawes. Major Morley. As you were. The three insurgents have now been questioned and certain information gleaned. We believe Badrai fled to a Taliban stronghold in the mountains. The insurgent who struck you. You have no idea who he is? - No. - Sure about that? Sir. He knows you. Me? I don't know him. What's he said? / am saying nothing. Why did you attack that British medic? Did he just say "Bashira"? He's saying you have ruined everything. - He knows me? - It would seem so. He keeps saying it is all your fault... ..even Bashira. So he was just saying Bashira? He knows her? Yes. He won't identify himself or give us any information. Just that it's your fault. Sir, permission to talk to the detainee. I don't think that's a good idea. If it's my fault, sir, he can look me in the eye and tell me. He might reveal more. He's been restrained. Let's see what happens. - Gonna tell him I'm coming in? - No. The element of surprise. Go in there, sit in the chair opposite and look at him. If he says nothing, simply and calmly ask him why it's your fault. Yes, sir. Nothing's gonna happen to you. You ready? Count to ten and follow us in. She has torn my family apart. Have 1? My sister has been taken and my father hunted. Hunted like an animal. Badrai is your father? He said, "Everything was fine until the Americans and British came and tried to kill us." - Bashira's your sister? - Not any more. You corrupt her with your pens and sweets. What do you mean? I mean... you've no right destroying my country. I mean, you've no right destroying...my family! I ain't scared of you. We will be revenged. My father will revenge our honour. How? Bashira. She will pay for her sins. She's safe. Not any more. Badrai's clearly on his way to Kabul. He has explosives with him. He's likely planning a significant attack. We mustn't let him near Bashira. We won't. A contact provided intel on the vehicle Badrai is likely to be in. He will inform us when he's underway. Let's prep a mission, Afghan Special Forces and a team of your Brits as back-up. I'll lead 2 Section, sir. I've destroyed that family. - No, you haven't. - Yes, I have. Instead of saving Bashira, I've put her in danger. What was wrong with the life she had before I kiboshed everything? Fine, she didn't go to school, but maybe that ain't so bad. You've always done the right thing. - He's gonna get her, isn't he? - Nope. Yes, he is, and it's all my fault. He won't, because we'll support the ASF and make sure that doesn't happen. You know and I know, if I didn't get involved, she'd be fine. Sohail would be fine, my section would be fine, playing volleyball and eating sausages. Instead, I'm about to put them in danger, all because I fucked up. Come here. He wanted to kill that little girl and you saved her. Her brother looked me in the eye and said it was all my fault. I'm looking you in the eye and saying it isn't. Itis! I'm an epic faill A little while ago, I would have agreed. You've taught me more in a few months than a year at Sandhurst and four tours ever did. - I don't think so. - I happen to know so. When I first saw you, I thought you'd hold the platoon back, one of those bad apples that infect those around them. Maybe you were right. You've made me engage my brain. We need to fix the small cogs on the wheel so the whole huge Afghanistan can work. I haven't fixed anything, I've broken it. No, you haven't, you were right all along. We do need to get involved, look after that little girl and give her a life. The only way we can fix the big things is by fixing the small. You taught me that. Really? I think you should be proud of the soldier you've become. Thank you, boss. I'm not always gonna be your boss. Not when we get home. We? Have you ever been to Bath? You know, the city. No, but it sounds a bit shit. No, it's perfect. I don't do perfect. It doesn't really suit me. Yes, it does. My parents have an old house there. It's where I grew up. I don't like those scary houses with the big staircases what people fall down. Like in The Omen. Have you seen that? That house at Christmas is magical. Are you inviting me for Christmas, boss? Have you got a moment, boss? Erm... In there. What do you want, Smurf? Got nothing to do? Boss, it's just... Smurf? Sorry, boss. What's wrong? Engagement ring. That's very sweet of you, and all, Smurf, but... ..my feelings for you are purely platonic. Despite what my granddad says, Winston Churchill ain't the greatest Brit who ever lived. You are. If I had a dad...I'd want him to be like you. I'm a bit young to be your dad, aren't I, Smurf? Mum's got this kind of gloomy feeling that I ain't gonna be coming home. I told her all about how I feel and that. She sent me her engagement ring... reckoned she didn't need it any more. She said... I shouldn't put off until tomorrow what I can do today, cos there might not be a tomorrow, you never know. What the hell are you talking about? You know, sir. No, I don't. Molly. Smurf... nothing is going to happen to you on this tour. Tell your mum to stop panicking. Can I suggest you put that ring in your pocket and don't get it out ill you're in Newport? You're here to work. I won't have anyone take their eyes off the task in hand. But if Molly says yes... Do not allow personal feelings to interfere with your work. - I'm not, sir. - That is exactly what you're doing. The word is, we're out of Bastion on a mission. I wanted to square it away with her in case something happens. Smurf, put the ring away. And don't mention any of this to me again or I'll put you on the first plane home. It's against Army protocol and it's endangering all of us. Understood? How am I endangering all of us? Smurf, go, now! Sorry, boss. Just...I only wanted some advice. How did you propose to your wife? Mission briefing at 2000 hours. Now, go. This is exactly what I meant and why I said wait out. You're annoyed with me? How the hell does that work? I'm saying I've done the same as Smurf. We're supposed to be here to work. - You're married and didn't think to say? - We've split up. Separated. I've come on tour so she can sort everything out. You're married. Did that just slip your mind? - Did you not hear what I just said? - You lied to me. Not once. You were fucking economical with the truth! Gonna tell me next you've got kids? Oh, shit, he has. Moll. Briefing, 2000 hours. - It's happening. - OK. Are you all right? You seem a bit... I'm just being quiet, that's all. Fair enough. Do you want me to get you anything? I can get you a pizza or something if you want. Are you sure you're OK, Molls? Hey. Hey. Don't you worry, all right? What am I not supposed to worry about, Smurf? The mission. Nothing...no one will hurt you... Ever. It's OK. Let it all out. What am I like? Don't worry about it. Sorry that I'm such a fuck-muppet half the time. You and me both, eh? Sometimes things can creep up on you. I'm the same. Thank you. I couldn't have got through this tour without you. We help each other through. That's the point. You're a proper mate. Molls, I'm gonna give you something now. Maybe it don't mean anything... as much as maybe I'd like it to. Please, Smurf, not now. I know what your answer will be, so I'm just gonna give it to you now, no strings attached... while I've got the chance. I might not get the opportunity again cos... things happen and that. We're on a mission, so... It's my mum's ring. But I want you to have it. You're my best mate and... ..this so doesn't suit me. You're so sweet, Smurf. AmI? Sometimes. You'll keep the ring? Well, if it doesn't suit you, I'll look after it until you want it back. You've looked after me, so I'm gonna look after you till I've got you home. That Badrai ain't getting anywhere near you. I promise. Sit up! Relax. The insurgent known to us as Badrai is on his way to Kabul with a cache of explosives. Our objective is to ID and apprehend him before he causes significant loss of life. Badrai's currently in the mountain region. In order fo reach Kabul, he needs fo cross the river where there's an existing ANA checkpoint. Reliable intel informs us the truck he's likely fo be travelling in is already on the road. ANA will stop the truck SO no suspicion is aroused. The only person who can positively ID the target is Private Dawes. But any visible presence of UK forces risks alerting Taliban spotters who will warn Badrai. So it is imperative that this remains a covert operation. At 0200, 2 Section will board the helicopter and travel to the region under the cover of darkness. We drop three kilometres from the bridge, so as not fo attract any attention. From there, we'll make our way to the checkpoint along an irrigation ditch. The ditch leads to a disused compound, 50 metres away from the checkpoint, which we will need to reach and secure before dawn. An ASF officer who will be with the ANA will make contact. We then await the arrival of the truck suspected of transporting Badrai. At which point, we'll break cover, and Private Dawes will be called up fo ID the occupant Once Badrai has been apprehended, we radio for extraction. This mission will determine how successful our time in Afghanistan has been. If Badrai eludes us, lives will be lost. One life is one too many. Any questions? No, sir. Let's go get him. Right, Smurf. Central in the ditch, edging forward. Everyone else, focus up. Keep a couple of metres between you and the person in front. Let's go. You can hate me if it helps. But I'm getting you home in one piece. - What was that? - Has anyone got a visual? - Was that contact? - Where are they? Everybody, stay down! - Is everyone all right? - Are you OK? - Must have been a mortar. - It's ringing in my earhole! - I'm fine. - All right. It's thunder. It's bloody thunder! Rain in Afghan! I'm so not booking this again next year, sir! - It's like I'm back in Manchester. - Cos that's a shithole as welll Everyone, focus up! Smurf, on you go! - That's the bridge, 50 metres west, sir. - Got it, I can see the checkpoint. Yeah, that's the compound, 50 metres south. Right, guys, secure the compound. Baz and Smurf, lead on. Clear. - Clear. - Clear. Kinders and Dangleberries, at those windows on guard duty now. - Yes, sir. - Mansfield and Smurf next. Then Fingers and Brains, Nude-Nut and Baz. Dawes, set up a temporary med centre. Boss. Let's get this place squared away! You need help? I'm all right. Are you? Yeah. What? We are doing the right thing. Never lose sense of that. I just hope that the right thing doesn't get those boys killed. Everything is under control. You volunteered for this mission. Yes. You could be safely tucked up in your gaff in Kabul. This word, "gaff"? House. We had an apartment. Did you sell it? There was an explosion. Is that what happened to your wife and daughter? Now I have nothing... except the guilt. It weren't your fault. No. But I survived. Sometimes I wish I hadn't. So you volunteer for missions. Bashira's the age my daughter... was, when she... And you are the age my daughter would have been. Unidentified male approaching. - Has he got a weapon? - Can't tell, boss. Identify yourself! Halt! Yeah, stand still! Sergeant Ramazan-Ali. Sergeant Ramazan-Ali. He's ASF, boss. Advance, one, and be recognised. Relax, guys, he's our ASF contact. - Salaam alaikum. - Wa-alaikum salaam. Manchester United. Nah, Derby County, me, mate. Support your local team, mate. Manchester United plays in red. And Manchester City plays in blue. What is going on? - You? Who you? - I'm a red, mate. Liverpool? Me and you are gonna fall out, mate. He says the ANA at the checkpoint will make radio contact with him as the truck approaches. So what now, then, boss man? We wait out. All right? That Ramazan-Ali's a bit of a case, isn't he? Abit of a nut case. A bit worrying that he's the best we've got at the checkpoint. It's gonna be all right. What is? Everything. We're gonna have Badrai by the short and curlies and back at Bastion before breakfast. You were all doom and gloom a few moments ago, with your mum's premonition. I just know everything's gonna be all right. Perfect, in fact. You're wearing my mum's ring and we're going home. Calm down, mate, it's round my neck, not my finger. When I first came out here to Afghan, I honestly didn't give a toss what happened to me. But now... Stop talking bollocks, Smurf. Fair play. It's funny though, ain't it, when you think about it? What? Well... I just wish I'd texted you back. I knew you were keen on me, but I knew I was coming to Afghan. Keen on you? Dream on, mate! If I'd have called you back and we'd met up, who knows what might have happened? I do - I'd have ended up killing you before you got on that plane to Afghan. Funny, though, ain't it... how everything works out? Like the bullet that got Geraint. 1,000-1, they said. A fraction of an inch either side and he'd still be alive. That's all I mean. If I'd have called you and we'd met up after that night round the back of the Indian takeaway, maybe we'd be together... Smurf, go back to Newport. Find someone who deserves you. All right, Dawes? It's all looking shipshape. I've packed most of it in the med bergan, boss, in case we need it at the CP. Not an ideal situation if we're attacked from the south here. We shall have to wait out for that truck. And for Badrai. Are you OK? Why wouldn't I be? I have a son. He's part of my life. Of course I wanted to tell you but the appropriate moment never came up. You really hurt me. All I want is to make you happy. Well, you fucked up big time. In that ditch, when the thunder... - It frightened the life out of me. - Exactly. In that moment, a lot of things flashed through my mind. I thought it was the end. Sodidl. I turned... and looked at you and... ..you're all I wanted. I want you to be the last thing I see. Ditto. Boss man, target's on the way. Ramazan-Ali has comms from the checkpoint. They will stop the truck, we await instructions. Everyone, kit up! The truck is approaching the first checkpoint. Sir, they're letting it through. It's crossing the bridge. - What's he saying? - Making sure they stop the truck. We're gonna lose him, sir! They've got it at the second barrier. It's stopped, sir. Stopped. Right, guys, listen in. We're together and we're in one piece. And that's how we're gonna leave, is that understood? Sir. I'm proud to serve alongside each and every one of you. You make me the soldier I am. - Baz, lead out. - Yes, sir. - Boss... - Clocked him, Baz. He don't feel right, does he? It's the ones you can't see you've got to watch out for. Everyone, take up your positions! Smurf, you're with me. Farmer Giles is still having a gawp at us. Smurf, eyes on that farmer and covering west. Dawes? You're to examine the back of the truck. Salaam alaikum. Wa-alaikum salaam. - Salaam alaikum. - Salaam alaikum. Everything looking as it should do, Dawes? Something ain't right, boss. Where's that contact? Smurf, what the hell are you doing? Come on, you wanker. Go for your weapon! Smurfl Smurf, what the fuck are you doing? Does that farmer even have a gun? Go for your weapon! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Put your gun down, Smurfl - Is he an insurgent, boss? - Has he got a weapon? Smurf, what the fuck happened? You! That's what fucking happened! - What do you mean? - You've ruined everything! What? I looked in. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, but put your gun down now, Smurfl - Are you all right, Smurf? - Boss, what the hell's going on? Hold your positions! Smurf, put your gun down! Worried I might shoot you? What's happening? Is the target in the truck? I don't know what the fuck you mean. Put your gun down now. Lower your gun now, Smurf. I'd have laid down my life for you, boss. And Molly. Private Smith, lower your gun now! That is an order! But she wants you to be the last thing she sees. Truck, sirl Sir, we need to ID the people in the truck and get it moving! Me and Geraint were identical twins, yet I was always the ugly one. How's that possible? I always got the shit end of the stick. Everyone loved him - I did, you did. And then, for the first time in my life, I found love. Then suddenly, everything felt right, everything felt like it should. What happens? The man who I trust more than anyone else in this world smashes me in the face with the shit end of the stick. Dylan Smith, you are endangering this mission and the lives of fellow soldiers. Do not bring "personal" into the battlefield! You did. Boss, boss! Boss, it's Badrail It's him in the burgal Everybody take cover! Man down! Man down! Captain James is down! Man down! One Cat A, urgent medevac required! MIST rep, wait out. Just stay with me, all right? You'll be all right, I'll get you out of here. Molly, keep your head down! Get the fuck down, Smurfl Two Cat A, urgent medevac required. Repeat, urgent medevac required. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Zero, this is Alpha Three Zero. Emergency medevac required! Smurf, I'm gonna need a bit of self-help. Can you get a tourniquet on that? Stay with me, sir. All right, stay with me. Stay with me. Molly! Qi, that's Dawes to you. Smurfl How's Smurf? Put direct pressure on this, boss. How you doing? Smurfl How's he doing, Molly? He's doing all right, aren't you, Smurf? I don't know, Moll. Yes, you are. You're gonna get better. You're gonna get better cos you're taking me to Vegas. Still want to go? More than anything in the world, I promise you. Direct pressure. Put direct pressure on that. Can anyone confirm he took a hit? - How you doing, boss? - You have to treat Smurf. I'm treating both of you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Where the hell is he? - Does anyone have eyes on Badrai? ♪ Shadow settle on the place ♪ That you left 4 Our minds are troubled by the emptiness 4 And if you're still breathing 4 You're the lucky ones ♪ Cos most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs ♪ Setting fire to our insides for fun 4 Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong 4 The lovers that went wrong ♪ But you caused it ♪ And you caused it ♪ And you caused it ♪ And you caused it Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
