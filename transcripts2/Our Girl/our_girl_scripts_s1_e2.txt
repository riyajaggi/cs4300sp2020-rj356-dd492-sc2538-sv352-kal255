 Don't tell me we've the only medic who can't stand the sight of blood. Bashira? That's a lovely name. I'm Molly. Molly? That kid is spotting for the Taliban and reporting back. - Man down! - That's Smurf! Sir, he's losing blood. I can get to him. Molly! I was a dickhead. I'm telling you, I've learnt a big lesson. I'm gonna come back to you.

 - Well done, Dawes. - Thank you, sir. You're an excellent medic. You're proving yourself. Bashira. You dropped this at the market. I've been chasing you. - Thank you. - That's all right. That's what we're here for. - Sang Chill Bazi? - Yes. Sang Chill Bazi! Come on, then. Right, last time you beat me, so this time the revenge is mine! Right. I'm rubbish at this. Ah, you beat me again!

 I tell you what, the winner gets a sweet. These are peng. My mum sends these from London. Peng? Take these for Ron. Later on! I'm teaching you proper good English here, Bashira. See, me and you, we're soul sisters! - Sisters? - Yeah. Better get off to school. You're gonna be late. I was always late... I spent more time writing in the late book than I did in all my other lessons put together! School. My father say no school. Why would he say that? Dawes! Excuse me a second. When did Her Majesty die and make you the Queen? Sir? You are not in charge. You do not wander off. Sorry, sir. I's just... - Know how much danger you put yourself in? - She dropped her scarf... So you risked your life to pick it up? Sorry, sir. It's just that she's become my friend. You do not involve yourself in the lives of the locals. They must not become dependent on us in any shape or form. - Understand? - Yes, sir. More importantly, don't put yourself in jeopardy. War Rages On ♪ The war rages on 4 You'll be at my side ♪ Through it all 4 Through hardships unseen ♪ We still survive ♪ Fortified This dust is like smoking 40 fags a day, man. So with the 40 you actually smoke, that makes 80. Yeah. I probably should quit, shouldn't 1? Look who it is. Our very own number one cockmuppet is back on the firm. - Hey! - All right, shitheads! Right, who wants to see my rusty bullet hole? Fingers first! Molls, you wanna cop a feel? It's a shame he didn't shoot you in the head, put us all out of our misery! Proper rinsed, Smurf. Oh, so she's flavour of the month now, is she? Yes, "she" is. Deal with it. Glad to have you back. I can't tell you how glad I am to be back, sir. - I won't let you down again. - Correct. You won't. - You're lucky it was just a flesh wound. - I know, sir. But with the blood you lost, you'd have died if it weren't for our medic. I know that too, sir. And more importantly, she risked her life to save yours. I made a mistake. We all make mistakes, Smurf. It's what we do to rectify them that separates the shit from the clay. Don't worry about me, sir. I'll prove my worth. As if "The Smurfoid Returns” wasn't treat enough, by way of celebration we have some very special guests arriving tomorrow. - Who's that, sir? - I'm talking mega. Huge! - What, Prince Harry? - Prince Harry? He's gagging to get out here. You telling us you bagged us the Royal Ginge, sir? Ask me no questions, I'l tell you no lies, Dawes. My mum says I've more than a passing resemblance to Prince... Shut up! Come on, let's see your rusty bullet hole. Yeah, man! All right, all right. Check it, boys. Gather round, gather round. Excuse me, sir. If it is the ginger ninja, why haven't we had royal security round to check everything? I haven't said who it is, have I, Dawes? Itis him. I can tell with you being all coy like you're not supposed to say anything but you can't help it. I'm like that. The doctor at Bastion says the medic has to rub baby oil into my bullet hole every hour or I die. Looks like you're gonna die, then. Charming. Cup of tea? You owe me more than that! That's true. Saving my life has gotta be worth a cup of tea and a bacon butte. Don't push it, mate. Your life ain't worth a whole bacon buttie! I'm there for you, Molls. What? Nothing. It's just that whenever anyone says "I'm there for you", it just makes me laugh. - It's just one of them expressions, innit? - Yeah, I'm just letting you know, like. - If you need me... - You're there. Yeah. For me. - So you got him to like you now? - What are you talking about? Well, you know, he was a bit sort of off-ish with you. Are you making that tea or what? Kinders, if you go left and hug the poppy fields we can get into the village that way. Sir. Swing a left here. "In Flanders fields the poppies blow..." Different type of poppies here, sir. More smackheads here than in Liverpool, eh, Brains? Don't stereotype us, you leek-eating, daffodil-growing sheep-shagger. Circle of rocks ahead, sir. Nude-Nut, you're up. My shout, sir. Not on your first full day back, Smurf. I'm all right, sir. I know you are, Smurf. It's just that it's your first full day back. You just don't wanna have to tell my mum she's lost another one, sir. Well, yeah, there is that. Anything happens to me, you might have to move to Newport yourself, sir. That truly is a fate worse than death, Smurf. 4 I'm Newport till I die 4 I'm Newport till I die 4 I knows I am, I'm sure I am 4 I'm Newport till I die You sad, Welsh tosser. They call Newport the Venice of Wales. - Who does, Smurf? - My Aunt Linda, if you must know. Although she's never been to Venice but she has got a tattoo of a gondola, on her arse. - All clear here, sir. - All right, lads, close in. Sir, I will be able to resume my duties as lead man, sir? Well, I hope so, Smurf. Lads, fall in on me. That dicker's still around then, is she? - Planted any devices around here lately? - Shut up, Smurf. - What? - Trapping off. I'm just saying, it's funny how wherever we are, she seems to pop up like a...meerkat. She does seem to be ever-present on our patrols. I'm right, aren't I, boss? There's something about her that smells a bit rotten. If she is the one you saw in the minefield, we should keep an eye on her. Oh, you're back, all right. I'm talking sense, Molls, and you knows it. Bashira, are you OK? Well, what is it? I won't let anyone hurt you, OK? Why aren't you going to school? That's the reason we're here. I must leave. I must go away. - Go where? - My father has said. He can't just send you away, can he? I've been promised to a man. What? What do you mean, promised? To be married. I must leave. Is that what you want? Get down! - Stay down! - Watch your back. I think it came from the school over there, Corporal. I don't understand. Why the school? The teacher says two Taliban came in, fired at the walls and went. So who was in here? Was anybody hurt? The elder was in his office. He came and saw them but they didn't harm him. The children ain't coming back. He thinks the presence of the soldiers has only made things worse. He says this is just the first. - The first? - First thing they do. Dawes. - Hey. - Is that for me, sir? No. But the letter on top is. Ah, it's from my sister, So you can stick that parcel up your arse. - This is better. - Wool Sir. I doubt that, Dawes. Gentlemen, this parcel is a package of mine from my mummy! While you sweat your nads off, I will be bathing on the steps of my very own luxury swimming pool. Two volunteers? One to blow it up and one to get the water and fill it up. Nude-Nut, Baz Vegas! Oh, how I adore a keen and eager soldier! Who's next? Dangleberries. A heavy one. What's all that about, sir? I dunno. Let's find out. Making chai? I take that as a yes? - You want chai? - That'd be lovely. If you're offering. You, sir, are a scholar and a gent. Do you know anything about what happened up at the school this morning? What happened...at the school? You don't know? Why should I know? The Taliban went in and fired bullets into the walls. You got a chai for our medic? The female? Well, we let them drink tea where we come from. I know, mental or what? All this... ..just to get the children to go to school? You got a problem with that, soldier? Yeah, that's why we're here, to make sure the children can go to school. They used to go to school before you arrived. - The boys did, yeah. - And now no-one will. So... ..what have you achieved? You go soon... and everything will go back to normal. And what exactly counts as normal round here? Your normal isn't our normal. And when you go, we will still be here. Dawes, work to do. Move. We're supposed to be on the same side but sometimes it really doesn't feel like that. Agreed. Did you see his face when you said about just the boys going to school? When it all goes back to normal like what he's talking about, Bashira don't stand a chance. - Repeat after me. Do... - Do. - Not. - Not. - Get. - Get. In-fucking-volved. - Because I need you 100% by my side. - lam, sir. Not if you're worrying about an individual child. I am 100% by your side. Well, good. Now go and read your letter. Heavily armed insurgents are controlling the area around the mountains and the village. The ANA will remain at the checkpoint here and we will maintain a presence in the village, so that the kids can return back to school. They're planning more attacks imminently. So be vigilant, guys. The buildings opposite the school are empty. To the rear of the school is a compound, which we will also control. Now we need the children to go back to school or the mission here has been a waste of time. We leave in two hours. Be ready. Sir, who'd win a fight out of you and Prince Harry? We'll find out later. Prince Harry ain't gonna be the mystery guest. I'm so nicking his beret and bunging it on eBay. Benefit Street! I'm from Aston. It's completely the other side of Birmingham! Listen up, you shit-for-brains lady parts. As soon as we get to the village compound, we secure the outside. - Dawes, go in and establish a med centre. - Sir. - Understood? - Sirl You can come to England now, can't you? - What do you mean? - After drawdown. - Is that what you want? - A peaceful Afghanistan is all I want. - Good luck with that one. - Indeed. How can she be "promised", Qaseem? - That's mad, innit? - Welcome to my country. What did you do before you come and work for us? I taught at the university in Kabul. English Literature. And working for us is better than the university? I thought I could do more good. They killed my wife and daughter. Who, the Taliban? So what is the worst that can happen to me now? There is no worst. I've already had it. D'you reckon Afghan will ever be peaceful? Yes. One day. I don't know when that day is, but, of course, one day Afghanistan will be peaceful and the most beautiful place on the Earth to live. One day. And every day is another day nearer. She is saying her daughter needs treatment. Well, tell her to take her to a local hospital. She says she is looking to you as medic to help. The local hospital is four hours away and she has no transport. - She's saying it's my fault, isn't she? - She is but it's not. A father hitting his child is as wrong in Afghanistan as it is where you come from. She has to go to her own hospital. - Those are the rules. - Yes, sir. Understood, sir. But can I at least examine the eye to access the damage? Sir, we have a responsibility... Please, sir, it is my fault if it was because I was talking to her. Well, get the eye cleaned up and then I never want to see her again. - You're not endearing yourself to me. - Thank you, sir. Bashira. I think you might gonna need a stitch in that, Bashira. Do you understand? Of course she doesn't. I barely understood. I thought your English was better than hers, sir. Mine is. Yours? "Might gonna need a stitch"? What's that even supposed to mean? She might gonna need a stitch. ['ll try putting butterfly stitches in it to hold it together. She has come looking to you instead of her local hospital. It's wrong. Sir, we have a duty of care for loss of life, limb or eye. Are you telling me the rules of the British Army now, are you? - No, sir. - It's my fourth tour, Dawes, and where it goes wrong is where soft fools start to get personally involved. I'm not soft, sir. Well, get her cleaned up and then she'll need to see her own doctor in her own hospital. Thank you, sir. Who done this to your face, Bashira? Was it your dad? He say I love America. We're not American. We're British. It's a whole different ball bag. Look, I'm gonna do all I can to make sure this never happens again. That's what we're here for. To make sure there isn't a next time for things like this. Do you understand? Hurry it up, Dawes. Can you get to a hospital? Show the doctor your face, show him your eye. I'll try and keep the wound tight foras long as I can. Thank you. I won't let them numpties hurt you. - Numpties? - Dawes! I'm just coming, sir. Look, we're here to stop the Taliban from coming to the village. And they won't attack the mountain if we're there too. OK? Do not go to the mountains. Why? What about the mountains? You must not go to the mountains tomorrow. Are you saying something bad is gonna happen at the mountains? Oi, gently! She must go. You all right? Why wouldn't I be? You just seem a bit... What's wrong? It's just Bashira... I think she was trying to warn me about something. Warn you about what? She told me not to go to the mountains, s0...the checkpoint, I suppose. But maybe she's just trying to... I dunno. She said something's gonna happen at the CP? If you've got intelligence, we need to tell James. There are Afghan soldiers up there. We're risking their lives if we don't report it. Come on. Any chance of a word, sir? You've got 10 seconds, Smurf, cos I am trying to relax here. Our special guests! Yeah! - Sir, we really need a word. - Gonna have to wait. Maybe Prince Harry's gonna have to wait, sir, because... ♪ God save our gracious Queen ♪ Long live our noble Queen ♪ God save our Queen Right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have got a special treat arranged for you today. It is my great honour and privilege to introduce to you... the Corps of Army Music! Where's Harry, sir?

I think I've received intel about an attack on the mountain CP tomorrow. - Sir. - Ops tent, now, both of you. ♪ Valerie - Sir. What makes you think it's credible? I've got a good relationship with the kid. There's a possibility that she's telling the truth. - I'm pretty sure her dad's Taliban. - You're making yourself vulnerable. Well, that is a possibility too but I was just being kind. She just told me. I don't think she meant to. Sir, I could see it in her eyes, she was telling the truth. - Her eye was a right old mess, to be fair. - That kid really trusts her...sir. You've obviously got close enough so she can confide in you. If that confidence leads to us being able to halt this group of insurgents... Then it could work out brilliantly, sir. Agreed. You two, wait outside. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. Whichever way this works, an insurgent attack is clearly imminent. Either they're luring us in or something else is going to happen.

Well, last time you saw the mountain CP, you were hanging off the end of a rope, bleeding to death. Casualty of war. Casualty of fuckmuppetry! Listen in, guys. 0130. We get there, we dig in straight away. Remember, stay focused, stay alert, stay alive. Just get all that stuff squared away over there, fellas. They think there was someone in that compound yesterday. - Do they think they're still there? - Not sure. Anything? - Kinders? - Sir. I want locks down on that compound now. Helmets at all times, gentlemen. Sir. Nice kettle, mate. Rolex. You sure about that, mate? If it is they've spelt "Tuesday" wrong. Rolex. Won it from an American playing cards. Rolex. Proper Rolex. How old are you? 18. Well, you're old enough to know Americans are full of shit. - Sir. - No, you're all right, Dawes. Talk about easy targets. I hope your intel's right on this one. Sir, if I am right, I'm a bit worried about the girl. Maybe we've compromised her. We'll worry about that later. Yes, sir. Dangles. Cheers, Dawesy. How are you feeling, Smurf? No heroics from me this time, sir, if that's what you're worried about. I promised your mum I'd wrap you up in cotton wool. Sir. Keep your helmet on and your head down. She's been surrounded by soldiers her whole life. Imagine that... Ain't normal, is it? -Eh? - Bashira. Yeah, well, we'll be gone soon. It's a shame we can't take kids like her home with us. Sir, do you get the feeling that Dawes is the type to bring a donkey home from Spain? - You the Queen of the lost cause, Dawes? - No, sir. I'm hard as nails, me. It's just sometimes it all seems a bit...unfair. It's luck. What is, boss? Everything. The whole world and everything in it. It's luck. My brother weren't so lucky. - Out there. - No, but you were. - There you go. - So you think it's all just luck... Luck. Fluke. Chance. Where you're born, who you're born to... Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Well, three out of four ain't bad with my dad! No-one at home would believe me but this is proper nice. - What? - Afghan. I've never seen anywhere so beautiful. If you think this is nice, you're gonna shitting love Newport. If it weren't so like...bloody war and all that, then I'd live in a little place in the mountains here. - You'd need Wi-Fi, though. - Well, yeah, obviously. And Sky TV. And a Top Shop and Starbucks round the corner. Bashira weren't born into much luck, was she? A dad that beats the crap out of her and... Dawes. - Shut the fuck up. - Sorry, sir. Sir, there's movement in the bunker. - How many, Kinders? - Definitely a couple. Maybe more. Everybody stay low and out of sight. Sir. There's someone heading into that store.

Oh, you could fry a pissing egg on my head right now, man. Please can we try that when we get back? He's right. You should not get involved. But we are involved, aren't we? What are we if we're not involved? Debrief, Molls. I'm coming. Anyway, sorry. - What? - You were right. About the girl. I know I was. Yeah, well, I know too now. There was no way that she was Taliban. I was sure that we were gonna find her dad in them six. I'm sure he's rotten. Maybe he's just normal rotten instead of rotten rotten. Reckon you must be winning James over now, though. Don't know about that, mate. He notices everything. And you've done good. Have I, though? I've compromised that girl. If anything happens to her, Smurf, then... It don't bear thinking about. Easy, you Newport numpty. Good work today. All of you. You did your platoon proud. - Everyo ne happy? - Sirl ♪ Private Dawes, high likelihood of mention in dispatches. Heard from Bastion. And without your excellent care, the doctors say there's no way the insurgent would have survived. Sir. Carry on. Right, lads, relax. And may I just remind you that tomorrow night it's 2 Section's turn to lay on the entertainment. - Are we still doing that? - Yes. Now, I will be singing a duet, so I need one female volunteer. Dawes. Lovely. And can I just say that I will sing with such majesty that the Corps of Army Music will be practically begging me to swell their ranks. - We know what song you'll be singing, sir. - What song? What's going on? Midnight ♪ Inthe darkness ♪ Before the dawn ♪ In the swirling of the storm 4 When I'm rolling with the punches... - Cup of tea? - Shitting hell, Smurf. You nearly gave me a Julius Seizure! This your secret cubbyhole? No, it's the roof of the shitter but it's the only place that I get peace and quiet from you lot asking for after-sun and Pop-Tarts. - You all right? - Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? You don't need to bite my head off for everything. - I'm trying to be nice. - No, you're being a pain. I was trying to read my little sister's letter. I've never seen a dead body before today, have you? I had the opportunity when my brother died. But my mum said, "Let's remember him how he was." Maybe James was right. Maybe he was just unlucky. Like some of the kids out here. Guess they don't know what's going on when their house gets bombed. Or when they're playing out and... Nice cup of tea. Sod off and leave me alone. Oh, and by the way, someone's spunked in the earpiece in sangar two, so if you're in there and the phone rings, don't pick up. Only a man would find that remotely funny. It was Micklar from 3 Section. Eugh. Is that what they call amusement in Leicester? Dawes... Just gonna hit my pit, sir. I'm knackered. I'll be asleep before the springs hit the floor. What does that mean? Dunno. My grandad used to say it every night. Ah, lyrics. Learn them and we'll do the tune tomorrow. Dangleberries is accompanying us on the keyboard, so no pressure. Sir. Um...excuse me, sir. Um, I've been thinking... Oh, dear, that does sound dangerous, Dawes. Well, my teachers did say if I had half a brain I'd be dangerous! You've been thinking about Bashira. If you feel she's been compromised, then we have a moral obligation to keep her safe. - Dowe? - Of course we do. What are we going to do? Well, you're going to bed and learning those lyrics. Piss off, Dawesy. You just called me "Dawesy". I'm clearly winning you round with my incredible charm and magnetism. Dawes. Dawes. Ops tent now. Have I overslept? We'll have checkpoints at either end of the street. Now, the ASF will be coming in here. What's happened, sir? Sorry to summon you from your pit at such an ungodly, Dawes. We've had Bashira's house under surveillance since the contact in the mountains. Sir. Intercepted conversations mean a plan is to be implemented ASAP. Has something happened to Bashira? We know that an action is imminent. Action? I thought we accounted for all six insurgents? Bashira's father is clearly in league with the insurgency. It would appear that he owed certain taxes to the Taliban which he has been unable to pay. As the only soldier who has eyeballed him, your role in this operation is crucial. A man who has been driven to extremes. Thus we need to extract Bashira. Well, do they know that our intel came from her? That's why we're going in. These gentlemen are to all intents and purposes, and for shorthand, Afghan Social Services. They'll help facilitate the removal of Bashira from her family and into a safe house in Kabul. You learnt your lady part, Dawesy? Do they know what song we're singing, sir? He only sang it all the way through training. Yeah. He made me sing the female bit once, didn't you, sir? You know why, cos you don't look like Prince Harry, you look like Sarah Ferguson! Never heard of her but I'm guessing she's either from Mansfield or she's got a ginger head. I can see the compound, sir. Roger that, Kinders. Zero One Alpha to Taj. We have eyes on the compound. We'll secure the perimeter before you go in. Yes, sir. Special Forces will go in, apprehend Badrai and get Bashira out and away. Not before we go in and secure the area. Any questions? They won't just go in firing, will they? It's just... Let's go. Prepare to move. Move! Clear. Move. Set. Go, go, go! - Clear! - Clear! She ain't in there. She ain't here, sir. - Where've they taken her? - I don't know, Dawes. - 1 have eyes on the girl. - Something's not right, sir. The locals are anxious. Gol Where? Where? Bashira, stay where you are. Stop! Bashira, stay where you are! Stay where you are! Do not move! Do not move! Stay there! Lift your arms up! Lift your arms up! Take cover! Kinders, I want all mobile signals blocked. All mobile signals blocked, sir. We need bomb disposal here now! They need five minutes, sir. We don't have that long. Dawes, what are you doing? Get down now! What are you doing? Please, sir, you're gonna scare her. Just let me do it. I need to keep her calm, sir. Kinders, is the ECM blocking all signals? It is, sir, but she needs to keep still. It could still blow. Do not touch the device, Dawes! Wait for bomb disposal. Hello, you. It's all right. I'm here now. Everything's going to be all right. I just need you to stay calm and stay really really still for me, OK? We're gonna get that vest off and everything will be all right. You're the bravest, bravest girl ever. Your dad can't beat you. You stood up to him. You showed him, you showed all of us, what a brave, brave girl you are. Everything will be all right. - Qaseem, have you tracked them yet? - 400 metres, sir. North-west. What can you hear? They are trying to detonate the bomb. They are trying to detonate, sir. We're gonna play Sang Chill Bazi. Me and you, we're gonna play Sang Chill Bazi, and I'm gonna beat you. We're soul sisters. - Sisters? - Yeah. Soul sisters forever. Am I going to die? No. No, you're not gonna die. Dawes, I need you to step away now. He's going fo remove the vest over her shoulders. She needs to stay calm and still. Dawes, step away now, understand? Just stay still, Bashira. Stay still. Dawes, get back! Move! Dawes, move! Move! Move! Kinders, I need to send a 10-liner. Turn off the ECM. ECM's off so we can establish comms. Dangles, tell... Is that any better? Abit. Well, it's a bit of a waste of an eye drop, sir, but seeing as it's you... Crack on, Dawes, or you'll be up on a charge. Where have they taken her, sir? I don't know. I don't care. That's a bit heartless, sir. It's not heartless. I just... I don't get emotionally involved. Anyway, I make you right about luck. A millimetre to the left, you'd have lost an eye. That's fate, Dawes. Just like getting that vest off in time. Things could've all been so different, couldn't they? If that vest would have blown, then Bashira would have been red-misted. And so would you. I would never have forgiven myself.

Fate's thrown us together. - Captain James? - Me and you. You haven't said anything happened other than what happened? I haven't said anything. What, so this is the end, yes? ♪ I've never been so wrong 4 Yeah, I might seem so strong 4 Yeah, I might speak so long ♪ I've never been so wrong ♪ Excuse me for a while ♪ Turn a blind eye with a stare caught right in the middle...
