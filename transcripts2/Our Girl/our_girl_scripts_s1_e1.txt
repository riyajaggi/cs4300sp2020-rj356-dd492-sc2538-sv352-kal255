 Do yourself proud. Brize Norton, 1100 hours tomorrow. You're to report to a Corporal Kinders and be attached to his section, under Captain James. First impressions are important. Make the right one. Private Dawes? Yes, Corporal. Welcome to the Under Fives. Right, Dawes, you are with 2 Section. Double in and join them. Can it really take you massive cockwombles this long to get in your sections for a bloody photograph? What are you laughing at, Medic?

 "Cockwomble," sir. For the benefit of our alleged new medic, who are we? The Under Fives, sirl And why do you think we're called that, Medic? I don't know, sir. Well, take a look. They look young, sir? And every one of them is in my charge. So if you can't cut it as our medic and part of the team, I have no hesitation in lobbing you out of the plane. - Is that understood? - Yes, sir. War Rages On ♪ The war rages on 4 You'll be at my side ♪ Through it all 4 Through hardships unseen ♪ We still survive ♪ Fortified - I love a medic, me. - Cos he's sick in the head. He'll need you, poppet. Pleased to make your acquaintance. I'm Mansfield Mike. - Although I'm not actually from Mansfield. - Yeah, he is! No, I'm not. I'm from Derby, actually. If it ain't my "Friday night round the back of the Indian takeaway in Guildford"! Oh, bollocks. We were bound to meet again at some point. That's the army for you. You call me "Round the back of the Indian takeaway"? Only for shorthand. I was going to text you back but we weren't allowed phones at Catterick. You've got something on your chin. Oh, it's just a bit of bullshit. I bet you don't remember what they call me. I do, actually. It's on my phone. "Smurf." Cos you look like one. No, I don't. I'm bunk-up material, me. I could have had any of your section but I chose you. Oh, I'm so proud. Listen, don't say anything to the others, yeah? You're an idiot. You don't want me to tell the lads? What happened that night, it was a one-off. I was pissed out of my nut. So you don't want me to tell anyone? You'd better not. First impressions and all that. I don't know if I'm comfortable not telling my comrades the truth. Well, I'm one of your comrades now, so you'd better not let me down. I'll just say I was on my phase two, went to Pirbright for the rugby... - met you and some girls and had a laugh. - Well, it's the truth. - Behind the takeaway. - No, don't you dare. Lads, mate of mine... Cockney... Goon. but all right. - Happy? - Ecstatic, you Welsh wanker. Oh, ho-ho. Cheeky. Right, hour outside Bastion. All don your full protective clothing including helmets. Look at that. Oh, my God. They got a Costa Coffee. They ain't even got one of them in Basildon, Baz. We got two as it happens because Baz Vegas is paradise! They got a Nando's? They best have a Nando's or I'm going home. I love Nando's, man. He wanted to get a Nando's tattoo when we was on basic! - Don't tell everyone our secrets! - Sorry, bruv. Look at the size of the sun! Loads bigger than the England sun. I'm going to need more than factor 50 out here. I'll tell you that for nothing. Left, right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left. Section, halt! Right turn! Platoon... platoon, ‘tion! Welcome to Afghanistan. You'll be here at Camp Bastion for a few days" assimilation. And then you are to be deployed on a mission. You have an excellent captain, on his fourth tour of Afghanistan. So you will listen and follow his instructions to the letter. Do well, apply yourselves and you'll have a good tour. Mansfield... Beautifull Well within our price range, eh? I don't know about you, mate. I booked the presidential suite. - Now I've got his stinky feet in my face. - Fellas! I'm leading a PT session at 0530. Make sure you hydrate tonight and first thing in the morning. Any of you helmets not on top form and giving me 100% will get my new regulation combat boot six-lace-holes up your arses. Best recruit at Catterick, one pace forward. Now, did you pass geography at school, Dawes? - No, sir. - No. Did you, Smurf? Oh, yes, sir. Good. Then you can show our Doris where the female quarters are. This...is stags only. - See you later, doc. - Come on, Dawes. Get your stuff together. You think I can't manage my own kit? Just trying to be nice. "Best recruit at Catterick”. What, the Captain say that to you every time he talks to you? He loves me. Everyone loves me. I'm the life and soul, pal. Dunno if I can put up with six months of your bollocks. Are you that pissed off the captain likes me? Maybe I don't want that Rupert to like me. Find your own quarters. What? He's a better person than you'll ever be. Don't worry about Smurf. Looking for the female quarters? Come on. - It's a bit bloody hot, innit? - You'll get used to it. Dump your kit. That bed's free next to mine. I'm Molly, by the way. Jackie. You've arrived on a killer hot day. It's like walking through treacle. So you know Smurf, then? I knew his twin brother. He was killed on Herrick 15. - You're joking? - James was his Captain too. That's why Smurf won't hear a bad word about him. I just called him a Rupert. Smurf's brother Geraint got shot in the neck on patrol. James crawled about 200m on his belly to get him and bring him back. He weren't leaving him as a trophy for the Taliban. He'd do the same for you. Let's hope he don't have to. We'll get something to eat later. - They got a Nando's? - Pizza Hut any good? Gotta be better than rations, eh? It'll be worth it, trust me. - Can't we phone up for a delivery? - You can! Serious. They got this little bloke that bombs around on a bike. Be quicker just to grab one now, though. You don't wanna be eating junk food before a Captain James PT session! We're off to the healthy tent. I'll still be running while you're breathing out of your arse. Obsessing about my arse again? Don't ask. Six injured. MERT's bringing them in now. All medical personnel to the hospital. - Come on. - Me? You're "medical", aren't you? Right, let's get him inside. Molly, get on this stretcher. Molly! Soldier vs. IED. Left below knee missing, right above, tissue damage. Unstable catastrophic haemorrhage. Slide. Massive wound to lower back. I need surgical access. Let me know when that's happened. We need blood stat. Still losing blood! Can we get a pelvic X-ray and a fast scan, please? - We're clear for chest X-ray. - Temperature 36. Come on, focus. We're losing him! Sort yourself out. You all right, Moll? I really thought my training would kick in. It will do. Don't worry about it. Will he make it? The marine. Got a better chance here than anywhere else. The state of him, Jackie... Get some shut-eye. If only! [tll be all right. Private Dawes. Private Dawes. Well, I suppose we should be grateful you're not wearing your stilettos. It's full kit, Dawes. Yes, sir. Left, right, left, right, left, right. One, two, three, four. Are we all acclimatised to the conditions? Sir. Right, we sprint the last 50. Gol Smurf, hit the deck now! Medic, man down! Left leg blown off below the knee. What are you going to do? Come on, what are you going to do? You're really going to let him bleed out while you gasp for air like a puffer fish? Come on, Dawes! This isn't Call Of Duty on the Play Station. Someone stands on an IED, there's a life to save. Get it? Come on, what are you going to do? Come on, Dawes. Smurf, get up. - Who are we? - The Under Fives. - Who are we? - The Under Fives! Now get yourselves showered now. Double away. He could have died just then. Please don't tell me we've got the only medic who can't stand the sight of blood. Relax, lads. We're out of Bastion in the morning and headed to our special little Forward Operating Base. This will be our home for the immediate. When we arrive at the village, we will link up with a small tally of Afghan National Army. Three's a small Taliban cell destabilising the area. Lovely. - Any questions? - No, sir. We need the locals to like us and more importantly to trust us. Nobody let me down. Right, our task on the ground is to support, assist and advise the Afghan National Army with patrols around the general area of the FOB and facilitate the local children's safe passage to their school. Sound easy? Lollipop men with guns. Then get your head out of your arse, Dawes. There is no such thing as an easy mission out here. Right, you'll be flown out in your sections 0400 tomorrow. So tonight I need you all to have seen the medic. It's like speed-dating, Dawes. One minute each, then sod them off out of it. Sit up! Nice one, Dawes. Lads, sort yourselves out. Single file. You're in your own time now. Boys! - Ready, Dawes? - Yes, Corporal. Right, Nude-Nut, in. Oh. What's all that about? I cut myself shaving and I know how much you hate the sight of blood. Do you feel fit? Any injuries at all? - You can sit down. - No, I best not. Fit and well. Shall I send the next person in? - Was there nothing? - No. See you. Boys giving you a hard time? I just feel like I keep getting off on the wrong foot. I keep saying the wrong things. Have you seen the way that Captain James looks at me? We're all trying to prove ourselves. You'll be fine. I promise you. I proper froze in that hospital. You'll be fine. It takes time and... Sounds like it was a nasty one. I'm worried that I won't be able to cut it. We're all worried we won't be able to cut it. Anyone who says they're not is bullshitting. Jackie told me about your brother, Geraint. When the Taliban jackpotted him, James said he heard a cheer go up. I'm sorry, Smurf. I'm not being...stupid or nothing, Molls, but these people, the Taliban and that, they're not like us. They're heartless. You'll be all right, mate. They laughed as he lost his life out there. He lost his life for our country, Moll. I don't want him to have died in vain. - What does that mean? - [t means... I'm going to make sure he didn't die in vain. You got piles, Smurf? Then you don't need to sit down, do you? You all right, fella? In case any of you were in any doubt, this is the real deal. The next six months will define the rest of our lives. There will be moments on this tour that you will never forget. Both good and bad. It's not about looking after number one, it's about looking after numbers two to 12 in your section. That way you will always have 11 people walching your back. It's why the British Army can never lose. It is what separates us from the enemy. This mission is about hearts and minds. We want fo leave this place in a better state than we find it Stay focused. Stay alert Stay alive. The day you are less than 100% focused is the day shit happens. Hello, you. Hearts and minds, Dawes. You don't wanna be talking to the little bleeders. -Eh? - Dickers. Oh, they might look sweet when they're little but they all grow up with one aim, to kill us. I think she was just being friendly. Straight back to tell some insurgent everything about us. It's their way. Fuel To Fire 4 Do you want me on your mind 4 Or do you want me to go on? 4 I might be yours as sure as I can say ♪ Be gone, be far away Water, boys. Throw it over there. Oh, comedy boys. All right, handsome? What happened? Someone set fire to your face and beat it out with a golf shoe? What are you going to do, shoot me? 0i, oi. What's all that about? That $10-Taliban was giving me the evils. Behave, will you? He ain't Taliban. He's one of us. All right, then, boys. First patrol. All right, lads, all those years of training, it's about this moment. Yeah. I hope there's contact. Come on, let's be having you, before the sun gets his hat on. Captain Azizi, let's go. A magazine of 30 rounds. Load. Hello, girl. Hello, you. There you go, little one. You stay? Pen. Pen. Pen! How was that? Thought there might be a bit more...action, sir. Were they watching us, do you reckon, sir? Without a doubt, Baz. After just one patrol you've become their ace of spades, the Taliban's most wanted man after Prince Harry. My mum always tells me I look like Prince Harry. The kids will come up to you, but don't be distracted. The ones on bikes by the trees to the west could have been dickers. What were they thinking, Dawes? That we're at our most vulnerable. Why? Well, we're finding our feet, we don't know the terrain. Right. 2 Section going out again at 1300. Everyone go and get some scoff. You not hungry, Dawes? I'm just going to wait for the ruck to die down, sir. Sir... Spit it out, Dawes. Well, it's just... as a medic, I'm a bit worried that Smurf's in the right frame of mind. Why's that? All that with his brother must have fragged with his head a bit. Well, he's an excellent soldier. He knows what he's doing. It's just that... he seemed a bit... I dunno, harsh, let's say, with an ANA bloke. It's just a bit of early tour dick-waving. Always happens. We're on tour! Looks like you're going to take off like ET. Whoa, speaking of which... Pen! Pen! Dawesy! We're all waiting at the gate. No time to put your face on. Can't see your pen-girl. I brought some with, just in case. They can't even read or write, so God knows why they need pens. Maybe they wanna learn to read and write. It's mad how much we take for granted, isn't it? You're not going to start getting all profound on me, are you, Dawesy? No matter how cute they are when they're little, they'll still grow up to hate you. Doesn't have to be like that. If we're nice to them... - Nice? - Well, what are you going to be? Contact left! Contact left! Take cover! See what I mean, Molls? Those fuckers have spilt my family blood out there. Did anyone see where that came from? I can't see anything. Two in the compound wall behind me. Keep your heads fucking down. Think it was from the compound ahead. I ain't got a skin what you're on about. I can't see nothing! - You sure? - They are targeting the female. They got eyes on us, then, so keep down! Come on then, you mugs, let's have yal Contact 200 metres ahead. Four shots. Single shooter, sir. - Have you got eyes on him? - No, sir. Interpreter says they're targeting the female. Get back inside, now! Right, one at a time, fucking sprint back into base. Rest of you, eyes on that far compound. First man, go! They know there's a female medic here. Move! - Gol - Moving. - Move! - Moving. Dawes, you're next. - I can't do it, Smurf. - Of course you can. They're after me. They ain't going to get you. I'm going to get them. They see you come out of this ditch, the wankers will appear. I'll blow their shitty heads off. Now get up and run! I can't, Smurf. Just leave without me. Dawes, what are you pissing about at? Go! Just sorting the med kit! You've got to go, Molly. - They'll shoot me. - No, they won't. I'll shoot them. I need you guys out of this ditch now! Contact ahead! I see the tosser! What the hell are you doing, Smurf? Get down now! Get down, Smurfl Get down! Now, Molly! Fucking run! Fucking run! No-one's coming out of there tonight. Are you sure you saw something? I didn't see anything. It was like Call Of Duty for a minute, boys. Unbelievable! - I wanna have another go at them, mate! - Come on! I haven't seen you run so fast since Dirty Doreen tried to grope youl - Did you see me run? - You run a mile before you buy a pint! I am never ever in my lifetime gonna be able to work at Foot Locker again. I am telling you now. Have they got a Foot Locker in Mansfield? I'm from Derby, man! What have we just learnt? What have we just learnt?! Every time we step outside this compound, you need to be totally alert. Medic. I need you to have a look at my blisters. Yes, sir. What do you reckon? Well, they stink, sir, with all due respect. His behaviour when he was unloading his weapon into that compound was reckless and unprofessional. Who, sir? Maybe he was "in the wrong frame of mind". Sir. Did you see anyone, Dawes? He didn't eyeball anyone. Say there'd been some children playing inside. It doesn't bear thinking about. Did you see an insurgent, Dawes? He's a good lad, sir. He's got a lot of stuff he's dealing with. You don't deal with it whilst you're carrying a lethal weapon. He's all right. He just saved my arse in that ditch. I knew I didn't need new boots. There was nothing wrong with my old ones. They'll wear in. Let me dress your blisters and you can get back to running us round the compound. - Well, let's see how good a medic you are. - The nuts, sir. Smurf. A word. Uh-oh. Right, Fingers... Oh, yes, sir. Give that to Dangleberries, would you? Dawes, mail. Come on. - She likes a male, sir. - Ohl Ow! I was about to say, "Has anyone noticed there's no grass in Afghan?" - But I spoke too bloody soon. - Ohl Boss man. Major Beck on the net. Right, Fingers. You take over. And no arsing around. - I am the only one allowed to arse around. - Sir. Right... Oh, Baz Vegas. Ooh. Smells like lavender, bro, and it's a man's handwriting. - Something you not telling us? - Sump oil, you dick! And it's my dad's handwriting! I know you've told the others that I'm some sort of dirty old slag. If the cap fits... Get out. Get out or I will seriously kill you! That is a shit thing to do, Smurf. Now no-one can even look at me. You brought it on yourself. There's only two things I don't like about you. Your face. Going to James and stabbing me in the back! It weren't like that. You think I'm mad. Out of control. A liability! He called me in and he sat me down... Maybe anything I said was cos I was worried about you. And I didn't say anything like that. But you said something, though. I saved your arse in that ditch out there! I know you did. And now you've gone and ruined my entire tour. Fuck you, Smurf. You already have. Blue Angel ♪ Blue angel ♪ Blue angel ♪ It's the memory of your warmth ♪ That keeps me alive 4 When I'm burning 4 And my world's closing in 4 Ooh, I'm on fire 4 Ooh, I'm on fire As you were, guys. Right, listen in. The proposed ANA checkpoint will be here. Based in an old compound the Russians commandeered a few decades ago, so we'll help Captain Azizi give it a bit of a Kirstie make-over. Dried riverbed below and across from the riverbed we have what intel reliably inform us is a minefield. They think they're old Russian mines but nonetheless capable of blowing your socks off. Any questions? Is everything all right, Dawes? They're sending me to Coventry, sir. That is worse than Helmand! Why are they doing that? Cos of what I said to you about Smurf. I have to get everyone through this tour. That's my job and nothing else matters. Yes, sir. And therefore I'm grateful to you. Despite what they say, you did the right thing to tell me your concerns. And for what it's worth, I think I make you right. I'm a tad worried too. Thanks, sir. Glad to see they're cracking on. What are they going to do when we pull out completely? It's not for us to worry about, Dawes. We do what we're told till we get back on that plane to Brize Norton. This whole place is going to go... I follow my orders and I trust those higher in the chain of command to see the bigger picture. - Really? - Absolutely. It's what we have to believe in and so I believe in it. I suggest you do the same. Minefield's to the west below the riverbed. Be aware. There we go. What's your name? How do you say "What's your name?" in Pashto? Have I said it wrong? - What's she saying? - Her name. Bashira. Ah, Bashira. That's a lovely name. I'm Molly. Molly. Molly. How old are you, Bashira? -11. -11? That's the best age. Stay 11 for ever! Tell her I've got a sister who's a similar age in London. Tell her that she can be my sister while I'm here if she wants. What's that thing they use in golf, for hitting the ball on? Tee. Milk, two sugars, please. Thank you very much. I wouldn't mind a cuppa. Relax, lads. Make sure you're loaded up on water. Dehydration's an absolute bitch out here. Check your piss. Make sure it's not too yellow. Fingers, I want you to set up a kitchen. Smurf, you're on latrine duties. - Set up an area. - Sir. Well away from my kitchen, please. And we need a spot to burn the silver shit bags. Nude-Nut. Dawes, I want you to set up a treatment facility with an ANA medic. Captain Azizi, I need you to clear those kids away right now. That little wanker is a dicker. What are you talking about? No, go on, say something, I dare you. All right, I will say something. That kid is spotting for the Taliban and reporting back. She's just a kid, Smurf. Chill out. Yeah, a kid who goes back and tells the Taliban exactly where we are. What are you up to? I guess I'm lucky the army weren't called in to make sure I went to school in East Ham. You didn't go? Could you tell? Still, you don't need GCSEs out here, do you? It's a good job I ain't got any, then, sir. Man down! Man down! Man down! Man down! Man down! - What's happened? - I don't know. Smurf saw something and went down the riverbed, sir. - Across the riverbed? - Anyone got eyes on? 200 metres. Half left. Behind the bridge. - That's Smurfl - It's the bloody minefield! What are you doing in a bloody minefield? I've been shot. I'm pumping blood! Smurf, what direction was your contact? - I'm pumping blooa! - He's got the Vallon with him. He took it down with him. He needs a medic! I can get to him, sir. I know my mine clearing drill. No fucking way. Wait out. - Sir, he's losing blood. I can get to him. - Wait out. Just because I'm a female, sir, I don't want special treatment. I'm the medic, I should go. I'm pissing blood! I can't stop it! Dangleberries, Brains, with me now. Move. Move, move. Move. Eyes out. Let's go, fellas, keep eyes on. - Has anyone seen the enemy? - Can't see him. Molly. Molly. Stay calm, Smurf. Brains! Dangles! Smurfl Smurfl It's pissing out of me. Smurf, I'm on my way. Talk to me. Alpha 3.0 Bravo. 9 Lino. Roger. So far. Over. Stay calm, Smurf. Where are you hit? Top of the leg. High. Groin. Can you get a tourniquet round it? I can't get it on. I's too high. Smurf? Are you all right, Dawes? Talk to me, Smurf. Nude-Nut, Fingers. Cover them as they're moving. - Yes, Corporal. - Yes, Corporal. You're going to need a winch. There is nowhere to land. I repeat, there is nowhere to land. - She ain't going to make it. - Yes, she will, Fingers. We'll make sure of it. Smurfl Come on, Smurf. Get up. Smurfl Talk to me, Smurfl Smurfl Are you all right, Dawes? Have you got eyes on Smurf? He's gone quiet. Talk to her, Smurf. Talk to her, Smurf. Come on, Smurf, you tit.

I'm all right, sirl She's all right, she's OK! - Come on, Moll! - She's all right. - She's all right. - Yes, Molly! I can't believe I've still got my legs. Just you, Smurf. Come on lad, come on. - Eyes on, boys, eyes on. Cover her! - I see her. I see her. Moll, what's going on? Smurf? Smurfl Smurf. Come on, Smurf. Talk to me. Smurf, come on. Talk to me. I've come to save you. Come on, Smurfl Smurf. Oi, Smurf. Stay with me. I'm gonna get you out of here. Please, please don't die on me, you bell-end. Dawes, how is he? I need a helicopter. I'm losing him. Just stay with me, Smurf. Keep talking. Keep making noises for me, yeah? That's it. That's it, Smurf. Sir, they can't land here. It's mined to buggery. They're gonna drop a winch. Secure him to the winch and they'll hoist him up. I'm gonna have to go up with him, sir. - Absolutely no way. - That's it. There's a sniper. You'll be a sitting target dangling on the end of a fucking rope. No way! Sir, the tourniquet's not working. If I take my fist out of his groin, he's gonna bleed out. Lucky I got here when I did, eh? Come on, Smurf. Dawes, do not go up on that winch. That is an order! I can't hear a thing, can you? Am I going to die? No. If you die, they're all going to think it's my fault. That ain't gonna happen, OK, wanker? Go on, girl! Dawes, do not go up on that winch. That is an order! Do you hear me? Dawes! I doubt she can hear a thing under that. She goes up with him, the sniper will pop her straight away. Sitting ducks, guys. Dawes. What do you think you are doing? Get off that winch now. That is an order. Dawes! Oh, fuck. Go on, Moll. Yes, Molly! Yes, Molly! Come on, Molly! - 2 Section! - Molly! What she just did there was stupid beyond belief! She disobeyed a command and put her life in danger. Fingers, cover them as they're moving up. Rest of you, eyes on. It was also fucking awesome. Told you you'd live. Shit. What? I thought it was a dream. That'll be the morphine. Smurf, what the hell were you doing in the middle of a minefield? I saw someone... I thought they were planting an IED. It was that kid of yours. Bashira? I went to take a look. I thought there was a path that was clear. Yeah, and what happened? I looked along the path and right at the other end there was this insurgent pointing a rifle at my head. Lucky he was a shit shot, then. Molls. Got transport to take you to the helipad if you're quick. OK. Molls, I was a dickhead. But I'm telling you, I've learnt a big lesson. Come here. I'm going to get myself better and I'm going to come back to you. Come back to me? To the platoon. I'm going to make it up to you cos I owe you everything. Yeah, you do, you nut-bar.

Having said that, did you hear me tell you not to go up on that winch? No, sir. Well done, Dawes. Thank you, sir. I'm not what Smurf said I was. - I didn't deserve that. - I know.
