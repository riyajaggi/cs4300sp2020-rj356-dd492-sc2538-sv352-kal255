 Doctor Bahil is adamant she wants to  travel into the Kowt-e 'Ashro region tomorrow. She's gone! They've got her. My death will be justified. Omar was luring British soldiers in to that building to kill them. I don't mind what you're telling people, right. What do I tell people? I thought you said your mum was a teacher? If she's not a midwife, you need to say. Dr Bahil rescued alive. Fingers, get in! Omar captured. Want me to do the honours, boss? It ain't happening. Fingers has been hit.

There's an exit wound. We did our best to contain the bleed but he's... His pulse is weak. Yeah, and he's struggling to breathe. I feel like I'm losing him. Describe his breathing, Georgie. One second.Shallow? Yeah. Yeah, he's breathing shallow, yeah. All right. If he's struggling to breathe, the bullet must have penetrated the lung. We're looking at a possible hemopneumothorax.Yeah. I think you're right. I need to release the air. I've done it before. Great.Right. I need a syringe. Syringe. Make sure he's lying flat. Yeah, he's lying flat.

Zero. 3 minutes to RV point. They've got him, Colour. Put your foot down. Looks like this mountain path stops so we're going to have to foot the last half a kilometre. We can't do that. We need to keep him level. We can all just carry the stretcher together and keep it steady as possible. We're getting him back alive, Prof. Too fucking right, we are. Right that's it. Everybody out. We're on foot. Right. Put him down. Watch his head. Watch his head. Watch his head. Watch his head! Right, keep it still. One, two, three. Right, two Section. Move. On me.

He's going to be all right? Yeah. Now, you go take care of yourself. OK? He's in good hands. Thank you. All right, guys. Let's do a primary survey. His tension has been decompressed. We need to put in a chest drain. Let's get some blood in to him. We need two large port cannulas. Gentlemen. Seat of pants. But at the end of the day, hostage rescued and target captured. History will say we did well. One Cat A and a few close calls, sir. I guess the chaps will have a good after-dinner story to tell. Well... ..all very worthwhile then, sir. Shame we had to leave behind a £2 million bit of kit. Hey, ho. Thank you, Sergeant. Well done, Mr Hurst. Could you shut my door, please? Wind picking up. "Forward, he cried, from the rear." Look after yourself, you Welsh tart. See ya. You all right? What's happening? Waiting for my work-shy homie to man up. He got lucky. Muscle and flesh damage. Few weeks off and he'll be in a ditch somewhere near you! He loves me really. Did we get medical assistance for Mrs Aarush? Mother and baby doing well, I hear. Not so the husband. He was in the back of the truck. What, that exploded?Aye.Oh, shit. When... When you stayed behind and we went to the RV point... ..did you think you were going to make it? No. You were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. Like Elvis. Get some sleep, yeah? Omar's currently being guarded by several hundred Yanks and your man, he's... He's in the best possible hands. Thank you. How far is it to the moon and back, do you reckon? I'm just saying, you know, because that's what people say, don't they? Love you to the moon and back. But surely it's not as far as Mars or...? That's infinity, innit? I don't know. I wish I'd listened in school. My biology teacher, yeah, told me that when you have sex, the bollock yoghurt comes out of the right testicle whereas if you do it yourself, it comes out of the left. One of yours must come back looking like a raisin and the other one a melon! Boy, I'm telling you, I tested it every 20 minutes. Is that what your teacher told you, Throbber? He's a bit cruel, isn't he?She. This is so much better than going out on the lash. You lot do realise that we will remember today for, like... Well, always, actually. Even when we're 100, you know? Well done, today, Mimi. Delivering a baby. Some real downstairs action, gal! Yeah, well, her mum does that stuff for a living so it's... It's kind of like cheating, innit, Mimi? Hey! Here he is. The man that saved Special Forces. All right. OK. All right. Look. This ain't an episode of Long Lost Family so let's all cut the clapping bollocks, all right? How's Fingers, Colour? Still in surgery, so I need you all cracking on with your after-action reports in the morning. Then normal duties resume. ALL:Colour. Here you are, Prof. THEY CHATTER We struggled to access the injury the bullet caused. He'll need more surgery in the next 24 hours.Again? We've achieved haemostasis but it's only a temporary solution, Georgie. One thing's for sure, though - he's a fighter. Come on. Go get some rest, OK? There's nothing more you can do here. I'm going nowhere. DOOR CLOSES MUSIC: This is the Walk by David O'Dowda. Georgie? You all right?Yeah. I brought you some scoff. Oh, no. I'm fine. It's a cheese omelette. Get it down you. You all right?Is it cheese? Er, it's goat's cheese. We do get it in Manchester, you know.Do we? Maybe not in Stockport. We've just got brown bread. BEEPING What's going on? What's going on? Antonio? Antonio? What's going on? Fingers? Fingers? He's VF.Fingers? We need to shock him.Oh, shit! MUFFLED: Oh, no, no, no! Charging, 200 joules. Fingers!200J. Everybody clear. FLATLINE Start compressions. You don't need to see this, all right?Please. Everybody's got a job to do without you getting in the way. Take her to my office. Stay with her. It's going to be all right. Oh, shit. FLATLINE All right, I've got this. SHE PANTS Come on, Fingers. How can it take this long? Get the adrenaline, please. FLAT TONE HE SIGHS FLAT TONE CONTINUES TONE STOPS Time of death, 8.49. INDISTINCT CHATTER I need to call Marie. HE SIGHS Fingers was the first person to welcome me into the platoon. His enthusiasm never waned. We've all lost a terrific soldier... ..and a friend. The platoon will stay here, complete the tour... ..and we do it in his honour. If any of you guys need to talk, my office door will be open 24/7. LINE RINGS I just want to go out there now and kill every last one of them fuckers. I keep seeing his face. I see it every time I shut my eyes. There's nothing that can make this better. This is...just it. SHE SIGHS MIMI:You OK, Georgie? I just...need to sort everything. Georgie, we can do that later. PROF:Yeah, we can help, Georgie. I CAN do this. Hi, Pa. It's me. Yeah. I just thought I'd touch base, say hello. Oh, OK. Yeah, no... Of course. Yeah. OK. Erm... I'm sorry. Just... ..say hi to everyone for me, then. OK, bye. KNOCK ON DOOR Come in. All set, boss.Wondered if it might be one of the guys. No. Me. Any... ..sage advice before you go?Boss? I never expected to lose a man on Op Toral, for fuck sake. It's a training and security tour. Yeah, well, we have, sir. And we carry on because... ..there's no option. Look. You've given them an opportunity to talk but keep them busy. They're counting on you to take charge. BUGLE PLAYS LAST POST Up. LAST POST CONTINUES I could come in with you. It's something that I'm better doing by myself, Kingy. Have you?Yeah. And, erm...thank you...for... Everything? Well, I was going to say driving me home but, yeah. For everything. Hiya, Mum. Thank you. You all right, Grace? Come on. Let's get you inside, yeah? Yo, is that Omar? Put me on guard duty. One night in his cell... What time is the funeral? 3pm. Stand up. Stand easy, guys. Right. All eyes on me, please. We're very aware of what today is, but it's business as usual. We go on. We have no choice. So we do Fingers proud. OK, let's go.ALL:Sir. Hiya, Prof. I, er...I knew your phone was going to be off. I just wanted to, er... ..borrow some of your wisdom. She looks done in. I don't know what to do. What can I say to her? You don't need to say anything to her, Mum. She knows you're here for her. We're both there for her. Georgie, don't go back. I couldn't bear it if I lost you too. Mum... ..you're not going to lose me. But I am going back. WHISPERS: Mum...I'm sorry. There you go. Thank you. GEORGIE CLEARS HER THROAT Wait. Are you sure on now? I need to hear it again. OK. PHONE BEEPS FINGERS' VOICE:Marie. How you doing? I've, er... ..got myself into a spot of bother, babe. We might have to have our honeymoon at the QE in Birmingham. LABOURED BREATHING I've got so much I need to tell you. Tell you how you...put my life in focus. I didn't even know my life was out of focus until you came along, Marie...and sharpened me. GROANS:Oh, Marie. I'm coming home. I love you. I'm sorry. What happened after that, Georgie? I need every detail. INAUDIBLE He loved you. We've both been loved. Everything's just a fluke. You bringing Fingers home that day. Me actually being home. Him slipping me his number when you were in the kitchen. It's all a fucking fluke. Obviously, I knew he was a soldier. I just... I didn't think it was going to end like this. I know. Please, just...make everything OK, Georgie, like you used to do when we were kids. Come here. Come here. Everything's going to be OK. SHE SOBS I promise. Move your thumb. What's wrong with you. Don't look at me - concentrate on your weapon! You fire with your thumb there and it'll be ripped off when the top slide springs back. Well, he should fucking know this. GUNSHOT BELL TOLLS Fingers and I, we, erm, we served together... ..experiencing things that we could never share with anyone else. And then he met my sister... ..and he fell in love and he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. A comrade of ours found a book underneath Fingers' bed. It was a present from Marie. It's called The Fault in Our Stars. SHE FALTERS SHE SNIFFS, CLEARS HER THROAT "The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, "because there was no longer anyone to remember with. GUNSHOT RINGS OUT "It felt like losing your co-rememberer, "meant losing the memory itself, "as if the things we'd done were less real and important "than they had been hours before." INAUDIBLE Detail, unload. What the hell are you doing?! Never point a loaded weapon at anyone. Are you stupid or what?Monk. We're trying to help you here. Maybe you need to learn a bit of respect.Shut up. You're a guest in this country... Are you taking the piss? Monk, Throbber, move away right now.Let's go. Move. Move.I'll see you in my office shortly. I'll knock that geezer into next week! Yeah, and if you do that, what's going to happen? You're going to get kicked out. I saw him when we was repatriating Fingers.Mate, they don't care. I don't know what you saw, but Fingers was nothing to them, man. I know how you feel. I miss him too. You'll never know how I feel, so don't give it the big 'un about knowing Fingers, cos you weren't his mate, or mine. Move. I know what you must be going through, but you've got to keep yourself in check. You feel something bubbling up, you count to ten. He looked at his watch, sir. What? When we were repatriating Fingers. It's not on. He was being disrespectful, sir. It must be unimaginable, Monk... ..to lose your friend and stay on the tour. VOICE BREAKS:I was his best man and saw them pack his life into a little box. I don't want my son handed a box with all of me in it. It makes me think, sir, what would happen to him if anything happened to me? I was a child of the regiment, like your little boy. You were like my Thumper? In the sense that... ..my dad was always on tour too. But you know what? If you make your time at home with him special, and you let him know how much you love him... ..all will be well. Is that what your father did with you? My door's always open, Monk. Hi.Hey. I used to come here every day after school. Meet my mates. Had my first bit of alcohol here. My first snog. Brendan bloody Lewis, on this roundabout. He told me about his mum's suicide. So, out of sympathy, I let him give me a love bite. Anyway, next day, went round to his, knocked on. His mum answered the door. Should have had it sussed out then, eh? It's bullshit. What? Everything, Kingy. Everything?Mm. Or are we just cursed? HE SIGHS Two sisters. Two sisters both losing their partners in Afghan. GEORGIE SIGHS Marie asked me this morning if everything was going to be all right. There was nothing I could say. No words will ever make it easier. It's just this... ..fucking hollow pain that never goes away. Ever. I think about him, Kingy. All the time. I put my head on the pillow and there he is. There's Elvis. I think about him so fucking much. You know, sometimes I wonder whether he's actually alive, and all this is just a sign. I know it's crazy.Mm. Kingy, I didn't even check his fucking pulse. Oh, come on, Georgie, you didn't have to. Oh, come on. All right, say he wasn't dead when they took him. You're looking at me like I'm mad. You are...mad. Look. Why don't you stay here for a bit? Get that head right?No. I'm going back to Afghan with you. We can finish off the tour without you. Kingy, don't you dare kick me off now.Easy. No-one's kicking you off. Your call. But I've a right to be concerned and you could do me the respect of listening. That's all. OK. Thank you. I'm fine. I'm coming back with you. I've got unfinished business. BABY CRIES # Go to sleep Go to sleep # Little baby go to sleep. # Well, it ain't going to happen with you warbling down the line at him. I'm soothing him, Doris. Yeah, righto. Tell him I love him.He knows that. And I love you too. And I love you back. Do you know what? There are parts of my life that I choose not to tell everyone. Right? OK. I don't know what you're chatting about, by the way. I'm just being friendly. OK. I don't care who your parents are. Whether they're teachers or chess champions or doctors. It doesn't matter, it's not relevant. I just don't want to talk about it because it's not important. You don't have to lie to impress us. Right? We like you for being you. We're here to escort you to the American base, sir.Fine. What are your thoughts? They all want a deal. And we want his intel on Taliban activity, here and across the border. He has known links with ISIS. His evidence would potentially damage the insurgency in the region. He's willing to collaborate. They'll say whatever they think we want to hear.Look. He'd only get a deal if he gave us something concrete. What have we got to lose? The sooner we pull out lock, stock and barrel, the better it will be. How was it? Yeah, we did him proud. What, don't I get a hug, or am I a bit ripe post-flight? I didn't want to say anything. You all right, Colour?Hello. You all right?Good to see you. How's your clicky knee? Ah, er...Clicky as ever. You know what? It could be your boot. I'll give it a check when I get in. How did you get on with Fault in Our Stars? Yeah, I got to the end. Just about.Good. Thank you for keeping in touch. Always. Come on, Cheese. LOUD MUSIC SPILLS FROM HEADPHONES Cheese, this is 2 Section. How do? Guys, we've got a new member for the duration of the rest of this tour. Prof, can I charge you with settling him in? Oh, yeah. You know me, Colour. Mother hen. Come on, Cheese.All right, mate? Come on, Cheesy, lad. I'm Throbber, yeah? All right, soldier? All right, Georgie? All right, Mimi? The wanderer returns. How you doing? How's Dr Bahil? Driving me crazy, wanting to be discharged. How are you? Fit and ready for anything the Army has to throw at me. I want to make sure you're ready to dive straight back in. 100%. You're a good soldier. It's been a difficult few days. It hasn't been easy. What's that saying? God places the heaviest burden on those who can carry it. Well... ..sometimes I can feel me knees buckling. I hope you always know that I'm here... ..if you need me. I know. Thank you. So you was, like, on the bench, and the manager goes, "Get yourself warmed up, fella - you're on"? Sort of. I was at Woolwich. They put out a trawl. Ta, mate.S'all right. It's been a right clusterfuck, this tour. I was briefed. I'm sorry to hear about all the shit. Look at you, fella. You look like a Victorian boxer. Wish I had my protein shake this morning now. I used to be able to bench nearly twice me body weight. I can believe it. Some guns you're packing there. Yo. I'm sorry about the other day. A few more hours in Op Massive and I reckon I'd be able to bench the whole bloody platoon. Come in. You ready for me and my clicky knee? Get in. Oh, you want me on your couch? Go on, hop on. HE GROANS It's all right? Yeah. Put this underneath.Thank you. Any discomfort? Ooh! Other than them cold hands? I'll wear my Marigolds next time. How's it been here? It's hit everyone. Mm. The enemy's been captured. I mean, it's not the end but at least, you know, I feel like it's... What, some sort of closure? Yeah, maybe. What? I think I may have inadvertently overhead some intel... ..about Omar. What? Don't shoot the messenger, but I think they may be planning on cutting him some type of deal. What do you mean? What sort of deal? He's going to give them information on various other warlords, and in return... They let him off? I'm not sure. I don't know. I mean, probably not. But there has been instances where warlords have been given a new identity and started life in a new country.No. Georgie.No.No, Georgie. Medic. I need to hydrate! Here you are. I'll just grab another bottle. HE WHISTLES I'm not being rude but I'm a bit busy. Look at you, all respectable in your uniform. Butter wouldn't melt. What would people make of this new you back home? Sergeant? Is it true? They're thinking about doing a deal with Omar and letting him off? That's enough, Sergeant Lane. Countless killings, torturing, beheading, blowing people off tops of buildings, but you grass on a couple of your mates and it's a slap on the wrist, innit?You finished? Right. Get outside, shut the door. Knock on the door and wait until I say enter before opening. Understood? KNOCK ON DOOR Enter. They just looked at me. It was so obvious.What? That they're complicit in this arrangement. I mean the Brigadier certainly is. Otherwise, he would have said it wasn't true. I wasn't saying anything to him that he didn't already know. He knows they're cutting a deal with Attan Omar. I could see it in his eyes. Yeah. It's awful, this bigger-picture crap. Come in. You knocked, Lane? On me. Sir, firstly, please accept my apologies for my previous outburst. It won't happen again, sir. At ease, Sergeant. We have a duty of care. We are constantly evaluating what is  best for the regiment and for the individual soldier. Sir? With regard to the current situation  that we're dealing with, you have a personal involvement that isn't beneficial to your wellbeing. We've all got personal involvement, haven't we, sir? Sergeant Lane. Omar's killed one of our platoon. He also happened to be behind the murder of your fiance. Judging by your erstwhile behaviour,  there is a cause for concern. Can you perform your duties in a dispassionate and professional manner? That's bullshit, sir. Sergeant Lane. You are rather proving his point. This is not a matter for debate. And... HE CLEARS HIS THROAT ..we need you to see the psych for evaluation. UNDER HER BREATH: Oh, my God. You will be confined to barracks and placed on restricted duties until further notice, and until it can be determined whether you are fit enough to continue this tour... ..or indeed continue in the Army. Thank you, Sergeant Lane. Can I just say...?No. Thank you, Sergeant Lane. BOOT CLICKS Tensions are running high, we've just lost one of our men. Watch where you're going, prick. Crack us a smile son. I'm so sick and tired of you British people. Omar is trying to cut some deal with the Americans. I think it's best you leave. Your psych assessment has been arranged for this morning. They think I've got PTSD, don't they? Let's not rule anything out at this stage. Heads up! Heads up! All rooms are clear, bomb-making factory found. HE ISSUES COMMAND OVER CLAMOUR What the hell went down with you and that old man? You keep my secret, and I'll keep yours. I want to hurt him.
