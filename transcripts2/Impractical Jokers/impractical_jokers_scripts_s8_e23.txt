 And... action! Well, it only took us 199 episodes... but we made it in Hollywood. That's right. Today we're on the Santa Monica pier, and guys... we are making a movie! Yeah. We'll be playing directors. And while our crew is "in" on it we'll be recruiting "passerbys" who have no idea what's really going on. The catch is the scene we're directing has been written by the other guys and will get progressively more bizarre. The goal is to get this extra to play out the scene no matter how bizarre it gets. If you can't get that person to act out that crazy scene that's a wrap! Cut! You lose. [Murr] Alright. Director Vulcano is on set. Yeah, can you... come around here, guys. [Joe] So, we're using our crew as extras. [Murr] This lovely woman has no idea she's on Impractical Jokers right now. She thinks she's an extra, cast in a movie. [Joe] Alright, Sal. So there's your scene, buddy. -Okay. So, basically, we're shooting today, basically it's like a coming of age, rom com thriller with a horror twist. He's selling it! He's selling it! In this scene, right now, you are pontificiating uh... if you should be leaving or not. You guys, you know, just a family nearby. I gotta tell you, Sal's doing a convincing job directing. He doesn't know the twist that's going to hit him. Three! Two! And [whispering] action! [light jazz soundtrack] [Sal] Terrific. Cut. I like it a lot. I liked it a lot. Okay, now you have an idea. Now you want to go to your confessional cam. Tell them to hang on. I might make the scene a little beefier. Just give me one second. [Joe] Yeah, get a little beefier, Sal. Here we go. [Q] This is the new scene. Your extra's going to run up to him say "STOP! before you get on that plane, listen to this!" And then she's going to pull out a flute and start playing. #### [Murr] Now, can Sall talk the stranger into acting in this scene? We'll find out. Are any of you willing to do a line? You willing to do a line if I gave you a line? Okay. Okay! Okay! What I just need you to say is "Wait, Joe. Before you get on that plane, please listen to this." And by... by chance... By chance, are you musically inclined whatsoever? -No. Okay, so. No worries, no worries, no worries. I have a flute for you to play. We'll add the flute in "post" and I need you pull the flute out and I need you to just start playing the flute until I tell you "stop playing". Okay. -Okay. Also, Joe? -Yeah? We're going to go with "funnel cake fury". So there should be a little bit of a mess. Alright, guys! Let's say we try it! Here we go! -Alright! Let's see! Three... two... action! [light jazz soundtrack] [Sal] Enter Charlotte. Wait, Joe, wait! Before you go, I want you to think about this. [blows into flute, no music] [flute soundtrack] [Murr] Keep playing! Sal! -Sal! Keep playing! You're not allowed to say "cut", Sal! Charlotte! Get in there and play that song, Charlotte! [sound of blowing into flute] [flute soundtrack added] [Sal] The message is getting through, Joe! You're being charmed. Sal, not yet! Don't call cut! Dance it out, Charlotte. Dance it out. [blowing noises] [Joe] Here we go, here you go, Sal, bring it down! [flute soundtrack ends] I'm still getting on that plane. Cut! One take wonders! You were wonderful! [Joe] Nice job, Sal! Hazel? Brian. [Murr] Ah, here you go, Q. Here's the talent  we found on the boardwalk. She just got cast in a movie. She has no idea it's a TV show. This is pretty easy, Hazel. All we're doing is, we're walking by. This is Mack, he's our orphan. Hi. You're just going to walk by from there to there. And then you're just going to ignore him. -Uh huh. Maybe even give him, like a little, like a little like that. And keep going. Okay? -Okay. So all the scene is on paper is this woman walks by this orphan. And doesn't give him change. -Doesn't give him change. Well, that's how the scene starts. Alright. And.... action! Money for a little orphan? [Joe and Q] Ohhh. Pretty good! [Q] Cut, cut on that. Cutting! Great. You know what? I got an idea. That was great. I actually want to build on that a little more. Give me one second. I want to write something. [Murr] Alright, director. [Joe] Alright, director. Here's what we want. We want her to walk by and say "You have nice, tiny fingers. Your dead parents [laughing] liked watches, I bet. Come work for me in my watch factory." Okay, boys. Talk her into it, bud! Uh, yeah. Let me ask you something. You think you could handle a line? Uh... what do you want me to say? Okay. So. Okay, so when he goes for change, I want you to stop. And I want you to say: "You have nice tiny fingers. Your dead parents liked watches, I bet. Want to work in my watch factory?" That's a lot of words. I know. Want to give it a shot? -I could try. Quiet all around, c'mon. Quiet on the set! Love you guys. Action! Change for a little orphan? You have nice, tiny fingers. I bet your dead parents liked watches. Want to work in a... watch factory? Sure! [Hazel laughs] That is a cut! You nailed it! It's pretty cool. My first feature film. If you don't count Damned. It's pretty cool. My second feature film. They'll bring over your extras and your script, and we'll get going. [Murr] Wade, right? -Yes. Alright, Wade. James. [Joe] Alright, Murr. So your regular scene's super easy. You're going to have our actors. Pete and Chá. We all know Pete and Chá. [Q] Of course. -Yeah, it's a little love scene between those two. You're just a passerby. You're on the dock here Taking selfies of yourself. Get the ocean behind you, the beach behind you. Alright, let's do it! Okay. Good. Good? Ready! And... action! How about that kiss? -That was a mistake. Is it my wife? -No. It's my wife. Cut. Cut. Cut all around. You know what? I feel inspired. I feel inspired! I might have an idea. Give me one second let me work through it in my head, okay? Okay, let me take a look at the script, guys. We... we're gonna switch up genre a little bit. You're gonna have the extra here fighting a dragon that will be added later in CGI. Okay. So, we're gonna twist the scene a little bit, okay? Let's see this explanation. You don't know about the whole story in the scene. This is kinda like towards the ending, but the dragon's come back. He just, nonchalant: "The dragon's come back." It'll be all around you. I want you to fight off the dragon. -Okay In any way you can. I mean: kick, swing, punch! There is no amount of swinging and kicking that is too big for this scene. You understand. Okay, great, let's do it. Okay, great. Murr, talk to him through the thing. Talk to him through the thing. Oh, wait. Remember, take a selfie. Angle up... You don't want to block your face. Great, okay. Okay, everybody settle. Everybody settle. Here we go, let's do it! And... action! Now, about that kiss. -That was a mistake. Is it my wife? -No. It's my wife. Dragons! [dramatic fantasy fanfare music] Rarraaghghg! Why are you guys not running!? It's a dragon! [Q] You're fighting for your life, Wade! We'll add the sword in, in "post". Now tell Pete and Chá to kiss! Kiss! The dragon won't go away! Unless you kiss! [Joe] Cut, cut. [Murr] Cut! [Joe] You know what? You know what? This is great. I'm very inspired. Let's bring in the dragon. Let... OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn [Joe] Great. This is great. Super inspired. I'm very inspired. Now let's bring in the dragon. Let... [Joe] Murr, just say that. Let's bring in the dragon! [Q] He's got a tail! Okay, ready. Roll up! Now fight the dragon! Do I actually fight him? -Actually fight him. Defend yourself against him. Ready! Roll up! And big energy! Action! I will not kiss you. [Murr] And dragons! Yes! Wade, get him! Get him! That's it, that's it! Cian's laughing! Cian's laughing! Dragon! Dragon! It's an "Imagination Dragon". -It's an "Imagination Dragon!" [Cian makes 'roar' noises] Wade, scream at them "You have to kiss for the dragon to go away!" Hurry up and kiss! My life needs it! [Murr] Okay. Fly away, dragon, fly away! That's it! Cut, all around! Unbelieveable! You know what, guys? We're just going to use the original take with no dragon. Uh, Sal? -Yep? Do you remember the phone call I had with you when I was living out here about 5 1/2 months and I was at my wits' end and I was going to move back home and you said "Don't do it, give yourself at least 6 months?" -Yes I do. You remember that phone call? -Yes, I do. The day before that phone call I was on this pier, crying. Defeated. -Really? Yeah. On this pier. Then you stayed. -Yep. And then you turned a corned and ended up loving it out here. Yeah. So that was it. It was that phone call, Sal, so thank you. That's a very dramatic choice. Why wouldn't you just cry in your apartment? You drove... Yeah, drove here. Paid for parking. [Q] You started your car and you drove. You wasted gas, precious money that you didn't have to drive to Santa Monica. Yeah, yeah. But I felt it would be more of a thing here. I love that you went so far out of your way to cry. I lived an hour and 20 minutes from here. With traffic! Gonna have you guys lined up here on... uh, to go to the restroom. Vee, hop on line right here. [Sal] So we got 5 people on the scene who are on our crew. Vee is the only person that doesn't know what's going on right now. Yeah. You guys. You're just waiting on line for the Port-o-Potty. Here, the problem is: they're going to miss the concert. Okay? Alright guys, let's do it. Let's lock it up! Whoever's in there, start to "do a turd" [laughing] Okay. Okay... If you're in... Okay, hold on. Hold on, okay. If you're in the... if you're in the Port-o-Potty, you can start... turd. Ready and... action! Ugh! The line's too long. We're gonna miss the concert! That's okay. We get to spend more time together. I feel like I've always known you. And... cut! Great. Joe, we've got a little rewrite for you. Come on over to the camera. You know, we've had an idea. What if your new actor... What if he comes out of the Port-o-Potty does a karate chop flips over the entire hot dog cart and then walks off screen like a robot? I'll need a pen. Thank you. [Murr] Port-o-Potty. Karate chop. Hot dog cart. Robot. [Murr] I mean, it makes sense to the story. Okay, good, we're going to do a rewrite. Ali, you were great, but what I'm going to need is something totally different here. This is going to be a little different. I'm going to actually ask Vee if you mind. Mind helping me out with this? Let's see if Vee takes the bait. I'm going to need you to exit the Port-o-Potty and karate chop everybody on line. Terry, I'm going to have you take a step back like... "What's up with the choppin'?" You come back and then Vee I'm going to want you to flip this. We own this. It's fine. And then after, I need you to walk off like a robot over here. [makes beeping noises] And then "meep moop meep". That's all I need. Is that good for you? Good. There's no way! Okay, so Terry. You're selling hot dogs here. They're coming in. It's their date, okay? You're just here. Pretend your business You think maybe these guys are here. Do you have a cell phone? No, I don't have a cell phone. -Okay, then, forget it. Alright guys, here we go. Lock her up! LOCK HER UP! LOCK IT UP! Vee, that dude's for you. Terry, "what's going on" And Terry, after the whole thing happens, he exits, give me a line. Whatever feels natural. Ready guys? Action! The line's too long. We're going to miss the concert! That's okay. We get to spend more time together. I feel like I've always known you. You guys exit. And... Vee! [action movie soundtrack] [Joe] Flip the cart. [Joe] Good. Really get... yeah! [Joe] Flip it, go ahead! Meep meep meep moop meep. Who let my dogs out!? And cut! That was fantastic! Fantastic! That's a wrap everybody, great work! Great work. And that's how you direct a movie Hollywood. [Q] Great job, Director Gatto. All the guys made it in Hollywood. So they're safe from the loser board. We're here at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles. While working as waiters, we've got to do and say what the other guys tell us. And if you refuse to do or say anything, you lose. Look, look it's been 200 episodes. If you don't get that we do this by now, I don't even know Well it might be their first episode. Oh, hey this is what we do! Check it out! [Joe] There it is, Murr. Canter's Deli! [Q] Wow. This is L.A., iconic, Jewish delicatessen. Why do we always find ourselves, no matter what coast we're on, to be in a place that serves delicious food? You know why. For the same reason my body doesn't fit in this XL shirt. -Yes! [laughs] Guys, you done with this menu? Do you uh... want me to take it for you? Ohhhh. What are you thinking? Anything good? [Joe] You might want to ask for proof of funds. That they're going to be able to pay for their food. The one thing is this. Uh... With the cheesecake specifically... Can I just see, if you don't mind? Uh. Proof of funds. It's $5.50, so if I can just see that you at least have the $6.00, you'll be fine. Yessssss. [Joe] Oh, she has it! Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh oh oh. You have $10? That's enough with gratuity. So you're fine. Hi guys, my name's James. How are you today? Alright, listen guys, I'm sorry if I'm moving a little slow today.

Rob Emmer is exactly what I think Rob Emmer is. Rob Emmer... yeah. Rob Emmer delivers on a different level. I'm talking about performance. When he's in the field he crashes and burns like the #### Hindenburg. Mr. Vulcano. Here are the "wife of your photos" Oh, man, that hurt! [Q] What are you doing? You hit the button to get out.

Alright, Sal. Go find fish skins. [Murr] Sal. I have one more line for that table. "So who is this thirst trap"? What is a "thirst trap"? -I don't know.

You ready to win, guys? -Ooh. Hey. [Murr] I have to tell you. I do have to tell you. [Murr] The staff and I have decided that you are... The staff and I have decided that you are... Unreasonable. [Murr] Sal, single out one of the ladies. You ready to win, guys? -Ooh. [Murr] I have to tell you. I do have to tell you. [Murr] The staff and I have decided that you are... The staff and I have decided that you are... [Murr] Unreasonable. Terrific. And he loses. No, she's terrific. They think you're unreasonable. Oh! He reversed it! He reversed it! Terrific. Unreasonable. Thirst trap. Enjoy the fish skins. I've been Sal Vulcano. Sal is coming out strong. You guys order already? Eveything good? -Yeah. Alright, Sal. Give the table a healthy serving of "F bombs" Did anybody try the #### roast beef? It'll blow your #### balls off. I like to lean in and say it low because I don't like other people to hear. but I can tell you guys will level with me. Excuse me. How many times have we talked about this? [Joe] It's Sal's real headshot! How many times have we talked about you putting your headshots in the menu for people? [Murr] Look at that picture of Sal! Did you guys get one of these in your menu? He's been doing this to everybody that he thinks is a Hollywood producer. If it doesn't stop, you're #### fired. Alright you guys. Sorry about that. I'm #### embarrased. I'm just going to leave it here. In case you know anybody. Thanks, guys. [Murr] The face of desperation right there. You on break, bud? What are you doing? [Murr] Are you on your cell phone? Rob... Rob Emmer? Are you "facetiming" Rob Emmer? Hey, Rob! Hey, Q, how you doing? We're out here in L.A. shooting the 200th episode. Uh huh. Uh, well, here's the thing. Sal doesn't think you're very good on the show. #### you! What!? He... he feels that every time you come on to set you... you take what we give you and then you mess it up completely In fact, he said that Dan Cast is a better version of you than you. Ohhhh! I just wanted to let you know that here on our 200th episode I guess you ARE on, in way It's just that I have to fire you from Impractical Jokers. [sobbing] So this is the end? It's all I have, man! [Joe] Ohhhh, god. Alright, I have to side with Sal here, buddy. I mean, you clearly told him to cry, right? How am I just supposed to walk away from this? [Sal and Joe] Ohhhh my god! [Sal] Dan Cast? You just got a raise. He made one motion that was funnier than Rob Emmer's whole phone call! [Murr] Alright, Q, here we go. [Joe] Just uh, let this couple know the specials today that are available at Canter's. Hey, guys. Did anybody come over and tell you guys the specials yet? Okay, let me just hit you with those real quick. Here we go. Today's specials are the Hemworth Brothers triple baked bean bags. If you guys are corn fans... we have Meryl Streep's one bite corn-on-the-cob. [Sal] You can tell he's confused by how many blinks. [Joe] His mind is like, clicking. We have, uh, saber-blasted porgs with extra schmaltz. Did you see "Last Jedi"? I do. It's only in Los Angeles, guys, that this kinda "bump into" happens. Q, get his autograph. Get his autograph. Can I get your autograph? -Thank you. That's okay. Your drums were in there. [Murr] I wonder if you could buy the rights to his life story. It's Hollywood, baby! It's where stories are made. Has anybody approached you about buying the rights to your story? Your life story. How much... if I was going to develop a screenplay... what does that run me? You'd have to research it. You don't mind being played by Wesley Snipes, do you? Just... you know how things are today. I'm just trying to jazz this up to make it a more sellable project. Do you care if you're played by like, Wesley Snipes? Thanks, bro. Thanks, guys. Oh the waiter will... I'm the waiter. Be right back. It's coming up aces for the Jokers in Hollywood! The loser board is still empty. Jay and Silent Bob are in the "hizz-ouse" in Venice Beach with the Impractical Jokers. They have to get someone to untangle these headphones, and if they don't Biggity-bam! They get pantsed by us! If they get pantsed by Jay and Silent Bob they lose. You have anything to add? Happy 200th episode, boys. Give it up for the boys! [Joe] We're back to playing pants party. [Q] This is it, baby. So they gotta separate the headphones before you get pantsed. There's no way. There's no way. I never thought I would live to see the day I would see Murr vs Jay and Silent Bob. That is what we're seeing. [Q] Alright, Murr. Good luck, bud. Oh god, I can't get this... Are you guys good with this? I can't get this damned thing untangled. I've been trying for 10 minutes. Do you mind if I give you a shot to try? Are you good with separating these things? You good?

At the very least, I could have had Jay and Silent Bob pull my pants down. And I didn't even get that? [Joe] Q's out there. Alright. Oh, man. Q, this is world's colliding for you, huh? -This is it. This is a big one for me. You got a long history here, buddy. The way I met Kevin and Jay, is that I was such a huge fan of Jay and Silent Bob. Started working for Kevin. And now here we are 25 years later and we're getting to work together on my TV show! Yeah. On your terms! Legends come here to work with us. I'm so excited. Yeah, well, we don't all get to work with them. You get your own legend. Yeah, thanks a lot Rob Emmer. Rob Emmer flies across the country to pull my pants down. Then doesn't pull them. Okay, here we go. Okay. Oh man! Hey man, could you help me with something? Can I borrow you one second? Let me ask you something. I'm having a hard time untangling these. Are you any good at this? Do you think you could untangle these for me? I could try. -Give it a shot. Go. [overlapping yelling] [Murr] Go! Jay and Silent Bob. You're in. Oh boy. Uh oh. Oh man, it's Jay and Silent Bob. "Q"... is for "quick" [Sal] They're running! They're running! Oh my god, these guys. Go go go! Don't run! Don't run! Do it! Why are you running! I got the undies, I got the undies! This isn't good! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! We love you, bro! [Joe] They got your ass out! You gotta cover that because we might get in "trubs" [Joe] Cover your holes. [Joe] This guy's still working on the headphones. Alright. Let's go. Come on. Biggidy-bam! All the guys are heading to the loser board. Alright, baby, we are on Hollywood Boulevard and you can't believe it, we got tickets to a big-time premiere tonight but ohhh.... we can't go! -Oh, man! Well, we'll try to give the tickets away to a stranger. But the thing is, the bizarre movie has been created by the other guys. If you can't talk the stranger into taking those ridiculous movie tickets, you lose. Side note: I've never paid for candy at a movie theater in my life. Do you steal it? No, I don't steal it. I go to the supermarket beforehand and buy it at a reasonable price. I stuff my pockets. And uh, you know, I win. That's a long intro. [Joe] Here we go, buddy. [Joe] There he is! -[Q] Ahh. On the famous Walk of Fame. Our star, if you will. Sal Vulcano. If we're going to be honest with each other, he's the star... of the shit show. Of this show? No he's not. The star of the shit show. I'm the star. I'm the star of the show! I'm the star! I always considered myself the star. -Yeah? I will say that you probably are the one that would consider yourself the star. I mean, I can't go. So... they're going to go to waste anyway. Excuse me. Do you want tickets to a movie here tonight? They just gave me free tickets. I can't go. It's for tonight, yeah. It's for uh... 8:35 here. It's called Escalator 2. No, it's a new movie. "The sequel to the movie where a group of strangers gets stuck on an escalator for 5 hours." Well, a group of strangers, in the first one, got stuck on an escalator for 5 hours. I'm just, I'm now just realizing the absurdity... of the movie. So, this is the sequel to Escalator 1. If you don't like scary movies, it's not scary. If you love scary movies... it's a great horror movie. How do you feel about escalators? -How do you feel about escalators? Yeah. Or down. "rot"... "L.A." So, you're breaking down the word "escalator". Do it. Let me see. 2. -2 "Rot" -Rot. So you're making "escalator" an acronym, backward? Okay, let's do it. What's happening right now? Yeah. Sal. You forget that weed is legal in Los Angeles, bud. That's what's going on. "2 rot" -I see that here. You got the weed socks. -Yeah. -I love it. Oh, really? That's a thing? Yeah. Okay, let's do it. -Alright. So... "Escalator 2"... backwards... means "2"... "2 Run Over The Angel's Lost After Crying Sadly on Earth." [silence] You want them tickets or not? -Yes. I'd love to. [Q] This sort of wacky shit is not going on in the streets of Manhattan. Alright, boys. -[Murr] Alright, Q. How we feeling? -[Joe] Fantastic. [Murr] Feeling good, buddy. You're on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, man. How would you describe the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Murray? Only the elite... Of course. You have to reach a certain level of... prestige and power and looks and fame and grace. [Joe] They don't just give it to anybody. [Murr] Noooo. Huh. What's this? [Joe] "Brian Quinn" [laughs] Look at that! Wow! Is that a sticker? [Sal] It looks so real. [Murr] It's not in line with the rest of the stars. This is the V.I.P. row over here. [Murr] Your sticker doesn't quite reach all the way to the end of the concrete. It's not a sticker, it's a star! Heh. I don't know who half these guys are, but I know who that is, you know? Who's Brian Quinn? He was on that show Impractical Jokers? You ever hear about him? Yeah, yeah. He was here. He was here tonight, they're actually having a movie premiere tonight. Oh. He doesn't recognize Q? Actually, they're having a movie premiere tonight with this guy in it. And they gave me two tickets. I gotta leave town. You want the tickets? It's called, uh... "The King and Guy" "Guy Fieri plays Queen Elizabeth II in a cross-dressing drama that will leave you questioning whether monarchies are the way to go". You guys want tickets to this? Brian Quinn's in it! Whadya talkin about you dunno who that Guy Fieri, the chef. Plays Queen Elizabeth... Yeah he's gonna be here with Brian Quinn. Carol, you want to go, right? I think you should take them. [Joe] Oh, ho, he's going to take them? Guy Fieri, the chef. Plays Queen Elizabeth... Yeah he's gonna be here with Brian Quinn. Carol, you want to go, right? Carol's in! Come on, date night! How many movie premieres you get to go see? You get to meet Brian Quinn! I think you should take them. Well, you try it. See what happens. Enjoy the movie, man. Nice to see you. Yeah! -Yay! It's called "star power", guys. [Joe] Star power. [Q] Joey! Okay. Alright, well if we can't go, we can't go. Thanks. Hey. I got two tickets I can't use. Would you like these, bud? There for a movie premiere here tonight. You can see, it's... I don't want anything for them. My plans changed, I'm going back to New York. Oh, you don't care? Well, I appreciate the honesty about that. Yeah, no, that's fine if you don't care about it. But it's just two tickets I didn't want them to go to waste. But if you don't give a shit, you don't give a shit, it's fine. Enjoy your day, pal. Breaking news: I don't care. I love it. I love him! How's it going? [Q] Yeah, that's going to work. -Fantastic. Her eyes said a million things at once. Before he even engaged! -She was like "this happens to me every minute". I mean, they're free movie tickets. What am I going to do? Alright. I'll call you later. Hi! Oh yeah. I can't make the premiere. It's a premiere tonight. Are you interested, for sure? It's uh... it's a movie tonight that's uh... playing at the theater. But I have to go back to New York. It's called "2 Brothers 1 Horse". "2 brothers lost in the desert with a single horse. 1 brother wants to ride it. The other wants to eat it. What happens next will shock you." 2 brothers, 1 horse. They don't know what to do with the horse. Joe, Joe. Just keep saying "shocking". What they'll do will shock you. So I don't want you to miss out on it. But it... There's only two tickets. So they'll have to tell you what happens. It'll shock you. So what... so what they'll do will shock you. It's for free. Take it. Take the whole thing. Here you go. I don't need anything. Wow, Joe! [Q laughing] You got lucky on this one. [Joe] Murr's up. Okay, I'll just give them to them. Guys, you want these tickets? They're free. I don't want any money. I can't go to the premiere tonight. It's for a movie. I don't want any money. I just don't want them to go to waste. They just gave me the tickets. It's "Prostitute Woman". "An unsuccessful businessman needs a date for a social event so he hires a prostitute that he meets, only to fall in love." The plot sounds familiar to me. Starring "Julie Robert" Yeah. I heard she has a heart of bronze. Nice try buddy. Guys. One more shot. Please. Come on. [Sal] Sure. [Joe] Yep, get another envelope. Alright. Here we go. Dude! You want these tickets? They're free. I don't want them. I can't use em tonight. I gotta fly back early. Th... th... they just gave me these movie tickets for a premiere. It's for "Lions and Tigers and Chairs". It's a "documentary about lion tamers. But it's just dudes getting shredded by big cats for 59 minutes. They had to keep it under and hour, or it would 'be legally be' audience assault." So, just take it. Do you want... You won't benefit from it? Neither will Murray, unfortunately. [Joe] Oh, Murr. "O for two" -Guys. Guys. Best out of three? Please? He's already "O for two". Sure. Yeah, sure. "Best out of three" You don't know how to do math? You stupid moron, you already lost two. Do you want these? They're free tickets. I can't use them. I got to fly home earlier than I thought. I don't want them to go to waste. They just gave them to me. It... the movie is, ummm... "My #### Ate My Balls" "My #### Ate My Balls" It's a big premiere tonight. It's about "137 of the worlds greatest animators and puppeteers spend 69 million dollars over a span of 13 years to create the sexual horror mystery based on a true story about Babe Ruth's weirdo cousin." Just take it. I don't want it to go to waste. Yeah, you want it? It's a big premiere tonight. -You got me on the puppets. I'll do the puppets. The puppets? The puppets. The puppets. Take it and enjoy. You got it, bud. Enjoy. [Q] Yeah, hey, Murr. Good job buddy. So, you realize what just happened? Yes. [Q] We gave you "two out of three" Yes. Yeah, you lost two. You only got one so you still lost. What did... why am I even out here then? [Sal] That's a classic case of "your #### ate your balls" right there. That's a wrap on Murr. He's tonight's big loser. Yeah!! It's the end of our 200th episode, and the loser is not me! It is Murr and... What is this? What's going on? for your punishment, we have thrown a party that cannot be beat. Yes. While in Los Angeles, we decided to throw a concert. We invited tons of Jokers fans and we managed to book legendary metal bad boys: Steel Panther, baby! That's right. And, of course, Murr, you're in the band. Yessss. You're... you're inside the band. Yeah. -You're inside the band. Kinda "in" the band. [Joe] Steel Panther is taking the stage. [Q] Oh, I love these guys. Alright! Give me some love! Yeah! [Joe] There he is. Geesh! We made Murray in the band. Meaning: inside the kick drum of the drum kit. [Sal] No one here knows he's inside that kick drum. He's just going to endure every song. I feel like an idiot. I'm the only one that can fit in a drum. This is what you get for being the skinny one, buddy. Are you ready for the greatest band in the world!? Steel Panther! There's a lot of people out there. We're going to rock your balls! 🎵[80s hair metal]🎵 Are you ready for the greatest band in the world!? Steel Panther! [Joe] There he is.

I feel like... my... my my fillings are vibrating. 🎵 ...three days later, guess who shows up... I'm also about 1 foot from this guy's balls. Now I wonder, because the audience is filled with Impractical Jokers fans have any of them guessed what's going on? -No, no, no way. None of them know that Murray is in that drum. All will be revealed. He... this... #### keeps... ow! We've told him to kick the drum as much as he wants. Yeah, no ####. 🎵 But I can almost guarantee I'm gonna wind up with that girl [Joe] The crowd seems pretty into it. What do you say we get them a little more into it? -Yeah, yeah, let's do it. You gonna do it? Here goes nothing. Alright! [crowd screaming] [guitar solo] What's up!! What's up, everybody!! Happy... happy 200th episode.
