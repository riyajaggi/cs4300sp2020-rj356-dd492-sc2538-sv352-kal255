 Hang tight, dude. Today we're working as nutritionists conducting consultations with potential clients. While doing these consultations, we'll have to do and say what the other guys tell us. And at the end we'll ask them if they want to continue to be a client of ours. If they say no, you lose. They're gonna say no! [Joe] Okay, here we go. Murray's opened up a Duane Reade here There's DayQuil, Imodium, Ricola, Advil -There's two bags Two bags of Halls. Not two packs! Two bags of Halls! At what point do you stay home, is the question. The show must go on, gentlemen. -The show must go on. I get all that. But what's with the shampoo and tampons? So, did they tell you what we're doing here today? Just asking some questions?

 Yeah, cuz I'm been eating vegan for the past year and a half. Uh, food habits? A lot of beans... legumes... I'm sorry, what? What was that last one? -You've never heard of a legume in your life. A "luh goom"? L E G U M E You're probably thinking of lettuce. Are you thinking of lettuce? -No. Oh, you mean gum in French? "Le gum"? I got it, I wrote it. Do you know what a legume is? -I got it now. In French, they call it "le gum". It's gum. No. -"lay gum" It's like seeds... [Sal] No it's not. And uh... -No it's not. It's a word for beans and seeds and... Oh! Beans and seeeeeeeeeds. "Lay goom"! Do you have any food allergies? [voice] Nut check. Nut check. Oh your nut check when off. That means you have to have an almond. It's a nut check. What happened was... I got to make sure I eat enough nuts... almonds... in a day. So what I do is I have an alarm that goes off that tells me when it's time to eat. Nut check. Got you. Truthfully, I'd be a lot heavier if I didn't have this tapeworm. Like, I would be a lot heavier if not for... Nut check. Tapeworms. I mean, gosh, there's no fat people in Heaven! There are no fat people in Heaven. They're just... they're just not there. How did Heaven come into play? You know if you go to Heaven and you see fat people there, you're gonna be like "this is a scam" Q, start writing and then just look up and say "did you just sneak a Twizzler?" Uh, hold on one second... Legumes... Yeah. Did you... did you just sneak a Twizzler? No. Did you just sneak a Twizzler? No. Insubordinate. Insubordinate. [voice] Nut check. Nut check. Nut check. Does that every 5 minutes go off? It's uh... it's a very specifically timed program. It goes by biometric data. Uh, so like, you ever... -Nut check. Nut check. Nut check It's becoming very aggressive. [voice] Nut check. Nut check. Nut check. [muffled] It randomly sets by biometric... Nut check. Did you need me to keep saying "nut check" into the mic? Nut check. Nut check. Do you think that you would be interested in taking... ...me on as a "nutritioner" Okay. Alright, well thank you very much. I appreciate it. [Joe] Great job, buddy. Fake! [Joe] Fake phone? Hi, how are you? So I'm just going to go through a bunch of questions with you. So a typical day of eating for you. Would you say you have three meals? Would you say you have snacks in there? So, because I'm an athlete, so I do boxing... it's just two meals per day. I'll tell you some real life knowledge I got. -Tell you something I learned. A good way to eat well... -A good way to eat well... is take a bite of something healthy... -is take a bit of something healthy... Every time [Sal] Every time that you... [Joe] You have like a dirty thought. You have like a ohmmmmm.... I like to eat something healthy or a healthy snack every time I have a thought about... Let's say uhmmm.... Uh..... A vacation. Or like intimacy! As a... As a healthy adult male we have these thoughts. It's documented! Sal, we put some celery there for you. Here, for example. I always keep fresh stuff on hand. So I'll just eat my celery. Every time I think of, you know, intimacy. That's interesting. And you said you were a boxer. Do you spar? And do you spar with men? Women? Both. [Joe] Take a bite of celery. But you spar with women? -Yes Interesting. It's gross. The celery is not washed. The celery's not washed! Off-the-shelf celery, bud. Not washed at all. I'll leave that there for now. Any food allergies? -No. If you were sent back in time for a week, do you think you could eat a whole dinosaur? If you were sent back in time for a week, could you eat a full dinosaur? A full dinosaur? You mean for a whole day? What do you mean? I give you a week. You eat that whole dinosaur? -Yeah. I want you to grab that dummy and put it on the table right next to you. Let me just... let's go through this. Alright, I want you to explain how food digestion works but be completely wrong. So, as far as like the digestive tract. [Joe] Food can linger in the breasts for almost a day. Food is stored in different parts of the body we're unaware of. For example... A lot of people do not know that food can be held in the breast area for up to a day. Interesting. How does it get stuck there, may I ask? How does it get stuck there? Interesting. It kinda stops in that area. Yeah. Also, the throat is where urine is produced. Urine... starts in the throat. That's kinda gross. -Yeah. You know, this whole thing, it connects from the top to the bottom. This whole thing, everything in our body... it's all connected. And it goes from the top to the bottom. Hole to hole. -You know, hole to... the other hole. Yep. So, if you had the chance to become a client based on... on meeting today. You would say...? -Yeah. Yes, okay. [Q] I knew it, I knew it. [Joe] Murr, here's an idea. Be looking for something behind that couch when the guy walks in. Say "have a seat, I'll be right with you." Have a seat, I'll be right with you. -Okay. One second. I dropped a nickel. -I dropped a nickel. [Sal] Buffalo, buffalo! -It's a buffalo one, I collect them. Oh, okay. Okay, nice. Alright, Murr, ready? Give me... 6 minutes there. What... what's your name, bud? -Chad. Chad? -Yes -James, nice to meet you. I'm a nutritionist here. Take me through your eating habits. Chad, take me through your eating habits. Um, my eating habits are like... when I wake up in the morning... I'll have cereal. -Yeah, cereal. -And I'll have like, eggs and I'll have bacon, you know Do do are you [stammering] are you fit? Do you look good? Yeah! Yeah! You are good looking. You're fit. You're great. -Thank you. If I had a nickel... -I tell you what, Chad, if I had a nickel... Slowly work your way behind the couch. And I just try to pace myself and... just try to get some good rest at nighttime as well. Actually, me and my girlfriend we was thinking about joining a gym. Sometime soon, because you know... Yeah. -Trying to stay fit. But uh... Are you alright? Yeah, I've just... I've almost got it. What's the longest you ever stuck to a diet, Chad? Um... I'd say about 6 months. And it was so funny... -That's great, Chad, that's excellent. Murray, try and sneak out of the room without him seeing you. Is this a gold-plated nickel or something? How often do you eat fried foods, Chad? How often do I eat fried foods? I eat fried foods, uh... Take me through a whole day of eating, yesterday. Okay, um... Yesterday I ate, uh... what did I have yesterday? I had uh... You keep going, keep going, Chad. -Okay, yeah yeah Yesterday in the morning, I had some chicken. [Q] Go go go go But not all the time, not all the time. [Jokers laughing] [Q] Alright go go go! [keeps talking about diet] [laughing] What the hell? What if I go in right now and I'm like "hey what's up, are you Chad?" I'm the nutritionist! I'm the nutritionist! Oh my god! I'll do my turn. Oh my god, right into his turn! Right into Joe's turn! [Sal] Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! [Q] Alright, go go go! What the hell? What if I go in right now and I'm like "hey what's up, are you Chad?" I'm the nutritionist! I'm the nutritionist! Oh my god! I'll do my turn. Oh my god, right into his turn! Right into Joe's turn! [Sal] Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry! Hey, how's it going? Hey, I'm good. How you doing? Good how are you? -Good, good. We having fun in here? We having fun in here? I... Hi, I'm Joe, I'm the nutritionist. Hey, Joe, how you doing? What's your name? -Chad -Chad, good to see you. Sorry to keep you waiting. So, we're just basically trying to get some nutritional information? Joe, at some point you got to notice that your lucky buffalo nickel is missing. ...it's been on and off. Throughout my life, you know. On and off as... I'm sorry I just [stammering], I was looking for my buffalo nickel. You looking for what? I have a [stammering] a lucky buffalo nickel that I leave on my desk. That was given to me by my grandfather. There was a guy in here, I don't know his name. He was looking for a nickel. There was a guy looking for my grandfather's buffalo nickel that he carried in World War 2? "Pulp Fiction" the story: my grandfather carried it up his ass. Yeah, well, it's the buffalo nickel that my grandfather took back from World War 2 He carried it as a good luck charm, my grandfather did. -Are you serious? -Yeah! He stored it in his ass the whole time. I came in here, and I saw him on this... on this couch. And he was trying to find a nickel. That's why the couch was out here? -Yeah! Press him for a description of who stole the nickel. What did... what did he look like? Bald guy, he's kinda skinny. -Bald guy, skinny. Yeah, he got glasses on. -Bald guy, skinny, glasses. Was he a white mother****? Was he a white mother****? -Yeah. "Is he a white mother****"! -White, bald, mother**** stole my grandfather's buffalo nickel! I'm sorry we're doing your thing, but It's hard for me to accept that some bald, white mother**** comes in here and steals my grandfather's buffalo ass nickel And ****, and ducks out! Alright, based on all this information, do you think you'd like to take another nutrition class with me? Yeah, yeah. So, that's a yes for me. How about for that bald mother**** that was behind the couch? I don't know him, so I'd say no. -You'd say no. I lost! After all that, I lost!? Murr got nickel and dimed so he's first up on the loser board. Today, Joe and Q are working at Fairway Supermarket, and that's it! They quit. -Yeah, we quit! -But... the weird reason they're quitting is going to be given to them by Sal and I. The goal is to get a stranger to agree that we should quit for the stupid reason. If they don't agree that you should quit... You know. Loser. -Yeah You're a loser. -We're quitting anyways. [Murr] Alright Joseph. [Q] Joey Gatt. On his last day of work. What's the matter, buddy? You heard? -No. -Yeah. -What? Today I think's gonna be my last day here. I just want to let you know it's been a pleasure serving you these past 10 years. It's been a pleasure serving you for the past 10 years. It... this store is not opened 10 years. No, I mean, with the company. Well, I had to quit. I mean it's been... They're making me wear gloves now when I clean the "turlets" They're trying to make me wear gloves when I clean the "turlets" Ohhh... I don't want to wear gloves. I want to get in like at home, you know, you clean... Yeah, yeah. -You know how it is when you clean They said you either have to wear the gloves or you have to quit. And I said, I'm a man of principle. You're forcing my hand. Yeah... So I should quit, right? I should quit. Well, I think it's for your health. My health? Well, if there's something in there... -Yeah And you touch your face or your mouth... That's why! I've had pink eye for 7 years. Maybe that's why I have chronic pink eye. -Yeah! So I shouldn't quit. -I don't think you should. Okay. You can not get someone to agree. And make sure that you wash the fruit when you get home, hon. I will. -Great. Hey, sir, you need any help with anything? Yeah, I ask only because it's my last day. I'm quitting today. So if you want any help with anything... I'm on my way out the door. Yeah. Here's the thing. Let me ask you your opinion on it actually if you don't mind. Tobey Maguire shops here and I don't want him to know what I do for work. Tobey Maguire shops here Yeah. And I don't want him to see where I work. You know what I'm saying? I don't want Tobey Maguire of all people coming in here... looking at me and being like "Hey I'm Spiderman, and you're this dope in a suit working here." Can't get big-timed by Tobey! Everytime I come to work, Tobey Macguire is big-timing me! I know he made millions of dollars off Spiderman. But that gives him the right to come in here and look at me like I'm a bad guy!? [Sal] Looks like a lunatic! I'm not a villain! I don't inject myself with crazy goblin stuff and take over Times Square! He's gonna come HERE and judge ME!? Right? What do you think? Should I quit? I think I'm getting worked up. Should I quit? I should quit!? Thank you, thank you very much! I should quit. [Joe] Good job, buddy. [Murr] Wow, that was tough. Q is on to bigger and better things while Joe is stuck on the loser board. Today we're going head-to-head, playing a game we call... Angry mob debate! -That's right. While chatting with strangers in the park, an angry mob lead by one of the other Jokers will run up to us and accuse us of something crazy. We'll have to defend ourselves. And the goal is to convince the stranger to take your side in the argument. Whoever the stranger agrees with wins and the other guy loses. [shouting] -Let's get into it! Excuse me, is there a pool up there? They have this tour of the park of different tree tour. But I don't see a pool. Alright Q, go get him. Alright, boys, where's he at!? There he is, boys!

You bruised our fruit, bro! Excuse me, ma'am. He bruised my fruit! It's not my fault, okay? There was a child who that reaching the fruit and could've fell out of the carriage it was in. So I helped the child and picked it up. And one rolled on the ground. And now all the farmers, from the farmer's market are peeved at me! You move the child! You don't handle a man's fruit! You don't handle a man's fruit! [farmers yelling] Calm down. I'm not in the wrong here! I'm not going to allow a human being to get hurt, over a piece of fruit! I have a choice between a human, and a fruit I choose the human. Am I right, ma'am? [farmers] That's right! That's right! We're vegan! We're vegan! We're vegan! Wait, did I win or lose? She said go vegan. Fruit's vegan. Murr, you lose, buddy. You won? You won? Yeah! Get him boys! [shouting] [Joe] Run, Murray, run! [Murr] This is the dumbest thing I've ever done.
