 [Murr] People love a good bush. Today, we're working at Raymond  Opticians, and we're all working different jobs. For instance, I'm the salesman. I'm the receptionist. I'm the eye doctor. Somebody expecting a delivery? We'll take turns assisting customers and as we do, we'll have to do and say whatever the other guys tell us. The catch is, at any time we can call for another guy to take over the interaction. Whoever refuses the most, loses. [broken pieces shaking around] That's broken. So, we all have a role today. And Joe's our receiptionist. You ready, bub? -Alright.

So they're first up on the loser board. Today, we're taking turns recording stranger's conversations in the park using this ridiculous device. When the person asks us why they're being recorded we'll have to give them an explanation that has been given to us by the other guys. If they ask you to stop recording their conversation, you lose. WHAT!? You can't hear us? WHAT? ðŸŽµ [sneaky spy music] ðŸŽµ [Q] There you go. [Joe] Here he comes. He's on the sweep. Oh my god! Just ignore. Just gettin' some audio. There have been reports of a pervert in the area, and I'm trying to get evidence. There was reports of a pervert in the area so I'm just trying to gather some evidence. Is it you? No no no no no no. I'm just making sure it's not you. Well, it could, it could be me. You were going "full perv" before I got over here? They didn't give a report on what the person looked like. I would say... tall, dark, and handsome? So... would that be you, or...? Did you just call me tall, dark, and handsome? I'm, I'm Sal. I'm actually [unintelligible] I'm Valerie. -Hey Valerie. I'm actually a celebrity. I'm on television. Yeah, I'm actually a celebrity. I'm on television. Also, can I keep recording you? Also, could I keep recording you? Is that alright? [Murr] Here he is. [Q] There he goes. [Murr] He's moving in. Sorry, I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to scare. I noticed you stopped talking. Could we get back to it? Did you hear about Maureen in accounting? Trying to throw out topics. What, Maureen in accounting? No, you guys just talk about Maureen. I just need some audio. [Murr] I leave this playing for my kid. So he thinks he's not alone at night when I sneak out. I noticed you stopped talking. Could we get back to it? I just need some audio. [Murr] I leave this playing for my kid. So he thinks he's not alone at night when I sneak out. I leave these tapes playing for my kids when I sneak out at night. So they don't think they're alone. Laughter's good. They'll feel safe. You guys know lullabies and ####? Nothin' ðŸŽµ[dramatic, sneaky music]ðŸŽµ [Murr] Joe, they're talking again. Run back! It's cool that I record this stuff, right? I can use it for my children at home when I sneak out? Not a problem. Ahhhhh! The check comes in the mail, yeah. Absolutely. No check. This is for official purposes only. These women have given consent without needing payment. They are non-union. Repeat. Non-union. I also have the right to exploit their voice with any means necessary for voiceover work and/or animation. Here, we go! Hey! -Oh, hey. Ya know what it is, I'm recording. I'm recording audio. Look at the woman in purple. You can talk too, it's okay. I need to record over a weird thing I did on these tapes. I need to record over some, some, some weird things I recorded on this tape. Can you just talk to yourself, because I can't be on... I'm sitting here, taking my lunch. And uh... I remember when I was in Saint Davis summer workshop. They had me talking. And I just kept talking, talking, talking. So they filmed my mouth. And then they said, "Well, that girl has a problem with talking too much." She's just narrating her life. You don't mind that I'm recording the audio? You don't mind? Oh, great, great. [Joe] Oh, now he's just rubbing it in our face. [Sal] I love this lady. Yeah. -This lady's the best. ...kids did she have. Oh, hello. [Murr] Oh, my god. [Joe] It's genius! Except too bad we're in a concrete park in the middle of Brooklyn. You've never heard of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn? Ah, my god. ðŸŽµ[sneaky spy music]ðŸŽµ You can just talk into the bush. It's fine. Yeah? Oh, no no. Stay away, no no no. It's okay. I'm recording it for um, uh... [Joe] Because I believe there's a ghost in you and the only way to tell is through audio. I believe that there's a ghost inside of you. and the only way to tell is through audio. So just, go ahead. No, no. I don't have any ghost in me. No no no, stay away. -No, it's alright! Don't get close. You can stay over there. It's okay. It's okay. Just keep going. We'll get it out of you. We'll get it out of you. I'm not speaking to you anymore. I'm speaking to the ghost. I'm not ghost. That's exactly what the ghost would say. I, I think you are like a little crazy. I'm a little crazy? Nooo! What makes you say I'm a little crazy? Just because I'm dressed as a bush in the middle of Brooklyn talking to you about the ghost inside of you? It's funny, but... -Is it okay if I record you? Yes! Alright. Now "leaf" me alone. [Joe] I can't believe it worked on the first person! People love a good bush. I don't give you my permission to record me. Listen to this: Sal is tonight's big loser. Ah, surprise, surprise. Sal is our loser. We brought him up here to Monarch Rooftop for a networking event. Here's what you got to do, bud. It's very simple. We want you to give out your business card to who we think is the most important person in the room. And here is your only business card. [Joe] Only. There's only one person in that party that's getting that card. Okay? You won't know if you gave it to the right person until after you've given it to them and we've told you right away. -And then what happens? And if you don't get it right, you've got to take that card back and give it to the next person. Because they're not imporant enough! Alright. I understand everything. [Joe] So, we're invading New York Cares' event. This is real charity people. Real charitable people. These are good people. You should look them up. -They're all important! But... Sal's got to find the most important person in this room. Sal, he only has one business card. [Joe] And here we go. Hey Tim how are you? -Hello. Pleasure. -Sal? How are you. -How's everything. -Good This guy's like a bad-ass Colonel Mustard. The ascot's on point. Oh, coat sorting. Okay. Oh my goodness. That seems, like, very important. To be support, over a decade, putting in the time. [Joe] Oh, he's trying to sell us on being important. He seems important. You're right. You might be the most important guy in here. I might have to stop. [Joe] You have an ascot on. Uh, I might be. It's a good thing to do. Let me, let me, let me give you my card. There you go. It says Salvatore Bruno there: philanthropist and entrepreneur. I'd love it if you'd keep in touch. You've got my number and my email there. Thank you. I'll see you in a moment. -Good. Alright, alright. -Okay. Please say that's him. No. So when do we want to pick who the most important person in the room is? Let's give it a minute? I'm going to feel it in my heart. Hey, how you doing? Elliot. Nice to see you. What's going on? Yeah, me too. I'm an entrepreneur and a philanthropist. But I worked in technology bringing that to historically disenfranchised communities. [Together, laughing] "Disenfranchised communities" Mostly Xbox. What do you do? Oh, excellent. This guy seems super important. -Yeah? Let me give you my card. If you ever wanted to do something... we could do something with the school? and we could do, like, a technology initiative there. [Q] Or if you ever just want to play like Call of Duty. Or if you ever just want to play like Call of Duty or whatever. Oh, actually. [Other] Ohhhhh! [Murr] No cards left. Hold on one second. Let me grab it for you. [Murr] And so it begins. [Joe] Ah, there he is! -Tim.... bo! Sal. Yeah, yeah. -This is not going to go well. This is going to be bad. [whistles] So..... [Joe] Okay, Sal. You have to get your business card back from your new friend Tim. Tim.... bo! Sal. Yeah, yeah. [whistles] This is going to be tough. This is going to be tough. So, so, so, Tim, I met uh... I met a person over here who I would like to [Q] God, this sucks! give my business card to. Um. Well [Joe] "Well, why don't you!" therein lies the rub, Tim. I, uh, I gave you my last one. If you wouldn't mind, uh... Thank you so much. Okay, thank you. [Joe] Oh! And he dismissed him! [Joe] Oh! And you got dismissed! [Murr] Oh my god! That is hard! -Wow! -Oh! [Murr] Look at Sal's face. He's got a thousand-yard stare on. That was tough, bud. -Ooh. Elliot, there you go. It's got my number and email on it. I'd love for you to reach out. Yeah. Sal, he's not the most important guy in the room. Take the card back. Oh. I, uh... [nervous chuckle] I'm just seeing that that guy over there is from a publication that I've been trying to to get with for quite some time. [Joe] And you have my only card. Mmmmmm. And you have my last card. Is there any way that I might be able to have the card back? Okay. -So I can give it to him? Yeah. Thank you, Elliot. Ohhhhhh. -Oh my god! [Q whimpering] Oh, I feel so bad... Oh ho! -God, Sal. -My god. How's everything going, guys? Okay. -[Q] Sounds important. Let me give you my card. Philanthropist and entrepreneur. Really? Ohhh. -Sal, get the card. Get it! That's actually my last card. I'm going to give it to Patrick. Lucille Bluth does not like that ####. Oh! For the blind. Oh my god. [Murr smugly] That's very important. God, so if you don't... I just want to... Robby, I'm going to give to you. You know what it is, I only had the one. So... I'm trying to figure out, who is the... more import... yeah there it is. Sal, spoiler alert. Neither of them are the important one. [Joe] Get that card back. [Q] Look at the hand, look at the hand! [Murr] She caught you! She caught you. It's a pleasure. Thank you. That was great buddy. -That was... Jesus #### Christ. Here's a hint. One of the people you've already given the card to was the most important person in the room. It was either Tim or Elliot. They're standing together. [raucous yelling] [Joe makes air horn noise] ...collecting them before we get them. So... Alright. -Yes. It's Elliot. It's Elliot. It's Elliot! Tim, wait. Tim, wait, wait, Tim! Wait, Tim, wait. Tim, wait, wait, Tim! Tim, can I just see that? Can I just see that one second? Tim, thank you. One second, one second. Here you go, Elliot. Thank you. -Our work is done. Our work is done here. Hey, thank you. Okay, so, the guys gave Sal the business in this very important punishment and now you get a behind-the- scenes look at how it happened. Cheers. Let me give you my card. So if you're in a networking event like this this would never happen to you. -No. Because you're just the most important person. I'm the... always the most important person. So what would do if someone tried to... I'd give the business card to myself. You'd eat it? Eat the business card. That is one way to keep a business card. I was at a networking event once, and I ran out of cards. I had one card left. So that's what was the inspriation for this whole thing. I said, "Murr I should go get that back", and we laughed. But I didn't do it in real life. -[Casey] Oh, no? Fast-forward. 20 years later. We're making Sal do it. -You make Sal do it. For years, I had my own business cards and they were such scams. What did they say? Uh, director, executive producer, producer... writer. Have you done even those things now? No, not really. You've directed. You did direct. I've directed short little movies, right? Damned!, we've seen Damned! -I directed Damned! ðŸŽµ[heavy metal]ðŸŽµ Holy ####! [angry crowd yelling] Sal's walking. Here we go. Sal's walking! "Christopher Walking". -Say "Sal's walking". Sal's walking. -Sal's walking. Sal's walking. Have fun, buddy. -Okay. You want to go for me? Okay, there go. It's your beverage. Got my beverage. Here's your beverage. What is, what's this about? It's a networking event. Cheers, boys, to not being punished. Oh, alright. This is some networking I can get behind. Sal's trying to figure out if people in the room recognize him from the TV show. This is a necessary step. We have to walk around first. Before we start. So, right behind you in the oversized, blue, crushed velvet chair. She looked straight at me, had a huge smile and is looking over here now. It might be because I'm attractive. It might not be. Here's another news flash. I don't know what I'm doing here. It's a networking event. -Yeah, you're supposed to be making connections. -Network! I know but they... all these people work for "who cares". [Joe] No! Not "who cares" Murray runs "who cares". That's Murray's charity. "Who cares" How are you enjoying it? So then, you're not very important here in this situation? Gotcha. I'm [unintelligible]. Thank you very much. Work in the technology sector. -Really? Okay, well, what type of technology? I mean, because... Oh, now he's got to give details! Like, uh, it's like... routers. And, you know, like, um... "Mouses" Like, uh... "mouses" we bring. Keyboards. Uh... "blue toof" [Joe] "blue toof" speakers. "Blue toofs" floppy "dicks" ...chips here and there. Floppy "dicks" and stuff like that. ðŸŽµ[upbeat jazzy music]ðŸŽµ Guys... as the doctor... Yeah. -Today. Is it a doctor? -Yes. -An optometrist? Yeah, I'm a doctor of eyes. Alright. No listen, you're my sales guy. That's a bad attitude. I signed up to move product. Not to bolster your profession. You signed up to move product for me! I don't respect you as a doctor. Listen to me: the way you react to me reflects on, you know, the whole place here. I mean, he doesn't reflect on me. Thank God. Do I own the whole place as a doctor? Am I Raymond?
