 Vice President Matthews.
 Mr. Vice President.
 Mr. Vice President.
 Frank.
 Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stand on your mark.
 I'm fine right here.
 Two minutes, people.
 So they pull me from the car,
both legs broken,
fractured skull,
 punctured lung.
 My heart stops.
 Two full minutes.
 They're pumping my chest.
Nothing.
 They grab the defibrillators.
 Nothing.
 Third time,
the pistons start firin'.
 Doctors tell me
it's a miracle I'm alive.
 But seriously, you talk about
a wake-up call from God.
 You don't get
to come back
from the dead twice.
 The President of
the United States.
 Good morning.
 The Education Reform
and Achievement Act
that I sign into law today
 will affect every
child and parent
in the United States,
 will ensure
a better educated workforce
for decades to come,
 and will reinforce
America's pre-eminence
as an intellectual superpower.
 And I'd like to thank
one man in particular,
 who never lost sight
of the larger mission,
 who spearheaded this bill
from the beginning.
 And that's
Congressman Frank Underwood.
 Invited guests,
please join us in the
East Room for refreshments.
 Media,
we will convene immediately
 in the Briefing Room
for our conference.
 Linda, thank you so
much for all the help
 you gave us in
getting this bill passed.
 No, thank you, Frank.
This was your baby
from the beginning.
 I appreciate you
standing your ground
on this one, Frank.
 I'm smart enough to
admit when I was wrong.
 I was just telling Frank
we should set up a weekly,
 so he can keep us up-to-date
on what's going
on in the House.
 That sounds like a great idea.
 Congratulations, sir.
 Garrett...
 I was wondering
if we could talk
for a few minutes.
 That thing I mentioned
a couple of weeks ago,
 about the jobs tax credit...
 I've been giving it
a lot of thought, Jim,
and I think it's a good idea,
 but I'd like to look
over my notes first,
if you don't mind,
 so I can talk about it
intelligently with you.
 Sir, you have your call
with the Prime Minister.
 Busy man.
 Yes, he is.
 Frank, I hear that
you are heading up
 the special election
in my home state.
 Peter Russo.
 We're trying to keep
that under the radar
until he officially announces.
 In fact,
we're not even working
 out of my office
until that happens.
 Where are you
working from?
 The basement of my house.
 Any reason why the DNC
didn't ask my advice
on the candidate?
 Well, I thought
they passed it by you,
or that Linda did.
 Nobody did.
 Well, that is unacceptable.
 And I have major doubts
about Russo.
 His inexperience?
 Yes. And he's urban-based.
I don't know if he'll
connect with rural voters.
 Look, frankly that's one
of my concerns as well.
 We're working on that.
 But if you were to come out
and stump with him,
 that would go
a long way to convince...
 Frank, I can't stump
for somebody
I don't believe in.
 It's early days yet.
I'd ask you to
keep an open mind.
 And let me know if you want me
to set up a meeting
between the two of you.
 Because, sir,
an endorsement from you
would be a big coup for him.
 It's good to see you,
Mr. Vice President.
 Frank.
 Congressman Underwood.
 Ms. Barnes.
I was under the impression
 you didn't want to
cover the White House.
 Slugline just got
access yesterday.
 I know.
 I left The Herald
because I didn't want
to cover the White House,
 and now here I am.
 Access isn't the same
as a ball and chain.
 Am I only gonna see you
at bill signings now?
 I haven't heard from you
in three weeks.
 Insecurity bores me.
 I feel the same way
about condescension.
 Your place. This evening.
And I'll text when
I'm about to arrive.
 What if I'm busy?
 You're just afraid
I'm gonna stand you up again.
 I just want to make sure
it's worth my while.
 It'll be worth your while.
This'll make up for last time.
 It's a piece of history.
From the President's hand
to yours.
 You believe in all
that higher power stuff
they talk about in the room?
 I believe there are
things beyond our control.
 Who or what's
controlling them,
that I don't know.
 I don't believe in God.
Heaven. Hell. None of it.
 Too much Catholic school?
 Maybe.
 I'm not saying you
have to believe in God, Peter,
 or anything for that matter.
 But you shouldn't
rule anything out.
 I should go.
 It's on the campaign.
 Our cross tabs show
81% of likely voters
 are willing to consider
a recovering alcoholic.
 Now,
those numbers dip a little
 when you introduce cocaine,
but not by much.
 Randy?
 It's a risk,
but it'll make waves.
 Free coverage
across the board.
 The narrative has
to be redemption,
 a phoenix
from the ashes.
 Well, let's not
focus on the ashes.
 We don't want people to
think Peter was a disaster.
 No, no.
We focus on the positive.
 A "fresh start"
and a "clean start"
both did well in focus groups.
 "Clean start" sounds too
much like "clean slate."
 I like "fresh start."
 Yeah, I do too.
 How we doing on
the fundraising?
 The alcoholic thing
will turn off
some of the in-state donors,
 but it's
an off-year election.
 We can hit up
the usual suspects
in New York and California.
 Walter,
how vulnerable are we?
 I'm not prepared to
answer that question.
 Peter and I have
yet to perform
 the holy sacrament
of confession.
 We still need to address
the shipyard closing, too.
 Claire's helping us with that.
 We are pushing a bill
called the Delaware
River Watershed Act
 and I think
it's going to bring
 about 5,000 jobs
into Peter's districts
 over the next three years.
 We have a draft
of the bill completed.
 Peter's in the process
of securing co-sponsors.
 And who have you called,
by the way?
 I have some emails out,
but most of them
wanna see a bill first.
 Have you set up a meeting
with the shipbuilders yet?
 I don't think
they're gonna back me.
 That's the entire
point of the bill, Peter.
 Well,
if I go to them and I say,
 "Hey, some of you
maybe will get your jobs back,
 "not tomorrow,
but three years from now,
 "and most of you
won't be getting your
jobs back anyway..."
 All right,
let's put a pin in this
until we get more sponsors.
 I have to go to the office.
I'll catch you all later.
 Okay, let's move on
to our field plan.
 I want to go through
the regions one by one...
 Francis.
 We spent six weeks
on that bill.
 It'll be fine.
He'll come around.
 I'll see you
later tonight?
 I have an appointment.
 So I won't see you
until morning.
 I'll be back
before you get up.
 I appreciate your
taking the time today, sir.
 Did you get that
tax credit memo
 the economic
research team
put together?
 You didn't ask me
here to talk about memos.
 I know small talk
when I hear it, Linda.
 The President has asked
that you take a step
back from Pennsylvania.
 You've been taking
a lot of trips there,
meeting with legislators...
 It's my home state.
There's a jobs crisis.
 We can't afford
to play favorites.
 The message is 50 states,
one solution.
 Not one state, 50 solutions.
 I never
expected to be involved
in every policy or decision,
 but I have been completely
cut out of everything.
 We value your input,
Mr. Vice President,
but right now, we can't...
 Don't condescend, Linda.
 No one even asked me
who I thought
should fill my seat.
 Why is Frank Underwood
leading
the charge on that, not me?
 That is a DNC issue.
 We are staying out of it
and so should you.
 And so I'm supposed
to just cut ribbons
and go to funerals?
 You know
what you signed up for.
 Thank you,
Mr. Vice President.
 I didn't get my pen.
 Your pen?
 From the bill signing.
 We'll see what we
can do about that.
 I can see
your security guy.
 Meechum?
 He's cute.
 He'd never go for you.
 Why not?
 You're too intimidating.
 He's the one with the gun.
 But you're the one
with the Congressman.
 Uh-uh.
 We'll talk after.
 We'll talk before.
 Peter Russo.
 Pennsylvania's first district.
He's gonna run for Governor,
 fill Matthews' seat.
It's an exclusive profile.
 With someone
no one's ever heard of.
 What's the angle?
 Alcohol, drugs.
 He's a kid
from the streets.
 I want the profile
to come out
as soon as he announces,
 and I'd like it
to be kind.
 I don't write puff pieces.
 Then get someone
else to write it.
 I thought you had
something for me.
 It's too easy for people
to link me as your source.
 It's dangerous.
 I don't benefit
from handing out
headlines to other people.
 Generosity is its
own form of power, Zoe.
 Step six.
 Take the opposite edge
and fold it into a...
 Step seven.
 Turn the model over
and fold both edges
 to the center
of the model.
 You always wear
sunglasses at night?
 How did you find me?
 I figured you had
to be in government.
 I kept googling till
I found your picture.
 This won't work,
what you're doing.
 That was a one-time deal.
You don't get to keep
coming back for more.
 I'll go to the police.
 They'll laugh in your face.
Look at you.
 If the police
won't listen to me,
I'll call TV stations.
 I know the names...
 Douglas Stamper,
Peter Russo,
Frank Underwood.
 You are walking down a road
you do not want to walk down.
 Please,
I won't call anyone.
 But I need your help.
 I don't have anywhere to go.
I don't have
anyone I can call.
 I've had to do things.
And I don't want
to do it anymore.
 That's all I've got
right now.
 Find a place to stay
and let me know where you are.
 I'll figure something out.
 You hungry?
 What's your name?
 Sapphire.
 No. What's your name?
 Rachel.
 Your ex-wife.
Anything uncouth?
 How do you mean?
 Bondage, orgies,
water sports?
 No. Definitely not.
 Narcotics?
She wasn't into that.
 Not even a little ganga?
 Okay, once in a blue moon.
 Ever with your children?
 God, no!
 Ever in front of them?
 Look,
I'm not the world's best dad,
but I would never do that.
 Fine. Let's move
on to prostitution.
 How long is this gonna take?
 Until there's nothing
I don't know about you.
 I wrote all this down.
 I've been doing this
a long time, Congressman.
 I know when I've scraped
all the shit off the shoe.
 Prostitution.
 After my divorce,
I took a trip to Thailand.
It was about two weeks.
 How many women?
 Ten. Fifteen.
 I... I don't know.
It was a bit of a blur.
 There were drugs?
 Yes.
 Opium, speed, some smack.
 Powder or needles?
Both.
 Would any of these women
know who you are?
 No.
None of them spoke English.
 And I never mentioned
I was a congressman.
 Have you mainlined heroin
back here in the States?
 Just once.
Any scars on your arm?
 No. I was mainly into cocaine.
 What about prostitutes
here in D.C.? How often?
 I fucked around a bit, okay?
 Details, please.
 Do you get off on this
or something?
 Does a doctor enjoy it
when he cups your balls
 and asks you to cough?
 You wanna know how
many times I came?
 I honestly don't care
whether you win.
 But if you do,
work with me.
 How often did you
solicit prostitutes in D.C.?
 Once every two
or three months.
 Sometimes more frequently,
sometimes less.
 Do you have reason to believe
any of them were underage?
 Jesus! No. Look,
they were mostly high-end.
 That doesn't
mean they were 18.
 I need a fucking break!
 What's going on?
 He's an amateur, Frank.
 If I can get under his skin
in less than an hour,
 how do you think
he'll hold up under the press?
 It'll be a turkey shoot.
 All right. I'll speak to him.
 Frank, it's just,
it's not gonna work.
I'm gonna get crucified.
 You'll be fine.
We've got a crack
team behind you.
 It doesn't matter
how good the team is.
With my past? Come on.
 From the very beginning,
I said this was the plan.
 You agreed to it.
I didn't think it through.
 We have to
tackle this head-on,
or the GOP will crucify you.
 We have to steal their
ammunition from them.
 Honesty is your best
defense and offense.
 I'm the one that
has to get in front of
 these cameras
and say this shit.
 They don't have to say it.
I do.
 Peter...
I wanna be governor. I do.
 But not this way.
I just can't do it.
 If you weren't unsure now,
there'd be
something wrong with you.
 I expected this.
 Not easy,
what we're asking you to do.
 It's okay to
vacillate a little.
 I'm not trying to throw
a wrench in the works.
 I know you're not.
I'll tell you what.
 You take
the rest of the day off.
You go back to your office,
 you catch up
with whatever you
have to catch up on,
 you get a good night's sleep,
you go to a meeting tomorrow,
 and then you come here
and we'll talk
the whole thing through.
 Can you give me
at least that?
 Yeah. Okay, Frank.
 Good.
 What's going on
with all
the little sculptures?
 I found a flower on
the dining room table
 and a bird on
the nightstand a few days ago.
 It's a swan.
 You made them?
Yes.
 A new hobby?
 No.
 It's an interest.
 May I bring up
something else
I've noticed?
 What's that?
 You...
 Standing in front
of the refrigerator.
 Is there a reason
you haven't
talked to me about it?
 I haven't felt
the need to.
 Is it bad?
 It's not pleasant.
 But, no, it's not bad.
 What can I do?
 Nothing.
 If there were something,
I'd ask.
 Did you think it was
weird that I called you?
 Totally weird.
 Except for the fact
that I was
planning on calling you.
 Really? Why?
 I was a real grade-A bitch
to you at The Herald,
 and I almost apologized
when I saw you at
the White House,
 but I chickened out.
 So, anyway, I am drunk enough,
and I am sorry.
 Why did you call me?
 I was just wondering
how things were going
at the old stomping ground.
 Here you go.
Thank you.
 It's just not
the same since Tom left.
 And I don't blame you
for doing what you did.
 But this new guy?
 Six years running EW Online
does not
a managing editor make.
 Would you ever want
to come work with us?
 I mean,
it'd be a huge fucking deal.
 Chief Political Correspondent
of The Herald
moves to Slugline?
 Did Carly Heath
put you up to this?
 No. Not at all.
But if you want,
I could talk to her.
 You think
she would go for it?
 Honestly, I don't know.
 She's got this sort of
anti-establishment
"fuck you" attitude.
 Conventional news bores her.
 But if you had
something gritty to show...
 I've got a story
if you want it.
 It's pretty fucking great.
 You would give away a story?
 If you're not interested...
 No, I'm interested.
 If I seem
a little hung-over,
it is because I am.
 A lot hung-over,
actually.
 God, I almost had
a couple of months,
 and then last night,
I...
 Well,
I don't remember much,
so...
 But anyway,
here I am.
 Keep coming back.
 It works if you work it.
 Thank you for sharing,
Diane.
 I'm Doug,
and I'm an alcoholic.
 Hi, Doug.
 One of the things I do
for a living is count.
 I count votes.
 Yeas, nays,
neutrals, abstaining.
 And I'm good at it.
 But the most
important count I do
has nothing to do with work.
 It's the number of days
since April 4, 1999.
 As of this morning,
that's 5,185.
 The bigger that number gets,
the more it frightens me,
 because I know all
it takes is one drink
to go back to zero.
 Most people see
fear as a weakness.
 It can be.
 Sometimes for my job,
I have to put fear
in other people.
 I know that's not right.
 But if I'm honest,
like the fourth step
asks us to be,
 I have to be ruthless,
 because failure
is not an option.
 The same goes
for my sobriety.
 I have to be
ruthless with myself.
 I have to use my fear.
 It makes me stronger.
 Like everyone in this room,
I can't control who I am.
 But I can control the zero.
 Fuck the zero.
 Thanks for sharing.
It works if you work it.
 Who would
like to share next?
 Was he at the meeting?
He was.
 I tried to find
him afterwards,
 but he was gone
before I could
catch up with him.
 Did he say anything?
No.
 He never shares.
He looked preoccupied.
 You think he'll show
up at the house today?
 I have no idea.
 He's not answering my calls.
 Mine neither.
Anything else I need to know?
 I hear silence.
I don't like that sound.
 Something came up.
I'm handling it.
 Something serious?
 Serious but solvable.
 Do I wanna know more?
 I don't think you do.
We'll be okay.
 I might have to involve Nancy.
I'm hoping I won't have to.
 But if I do,
she'll have no knowledge
of anything damaging.
 All right.
Use your best judgment.
 Of course, sir.
 I've gotta go.
 Miss Gallagher?
 Can the Congressman
have a moment?
 Things are...
They're complicated.
 I realize that,
but he truly needs you.
 I don't know what
I could say to him.
 I think just showing up
would do him a world of good.
 Today is tough.
The Speaker has
a full schedule...
 Look, I already spoke to Bob,
and he said he'd be fine
 if you took
the rest of the day off.
 In fact, he said it'd be fine
if you wanted to take
 the next six months off.
What?
 I want you to be
deputy campaign manager.
 You work under Nash Aarons.
 No. I spent years
being Peter's crutch.
If you just want me there...
 Well, of course we
want you there to help,
but not as a crutch.
 Peter is a talented young man
with a lot of potential.
 He knows this,
 but he needs to hear it
from someone other than me.
 Someone he truly cares about.
 I'm sorry.
This is just a lot right now.
 Well, you don't have
to make a decision now,
 but at least talk to Peter.
 I mean,
there's no harm in that,
now, is there?
 10 grand.
 We divert it from
your campaign accounts.
 We itemize it
so it looks like...
 Wait.
 You want me to pay for this?
 Use Frank's re-election fund.
 Commissioner, the majority of
the money that you've raised
 has come from people
we've sent your way.
 And you sent them because
I sprung your boy,
Russo, in the first place.
 We're even.
I don't owe you shit.
 There's a girl in trouble.
Let's help her out.
 Not my problem.
 It could be.
 We put her back
on the streets,
 there's no telling
what she could do.
 I'm a hell of
a lot more afraid
of the U.S. Attorney
 than I am of some hooker.
 This is a very inexpensive
insurance policy.
 I already broke
the law once, Doug.
 There's no fucking way
I'm gonna mess
 with campaign
finance regulations.
 I don't even wanna
be hearing this shit.
 Funeral for the former
ambassador of Japan
tomorrow at 9:30,
 followed by a luncheon
with the National
Board of Directors
 for the Girl Scouts
of America.
 Mr. President.
Jim.
 After that, you've got a meet
and greet with the finalist...
 I'll catch up with you
in a minute.
 This way, sir.
 Hi.
 Hey.
 What are you doing here?
 The Congressman
wanted me to come over.
 Why?
 He wants me to work
for your campaign.
 Deputy manager.
Frank!
 He said you're
having some doubts.
 I was just about to tell him
that I decided not to run.
 Okay.
If you've made up your mind,
 then I should
probably get going.
 Did he tell you
about the whole plan?
About coming clean?
 Yeah, he did.
 I have Kevin and Sarah
to think about.
 Everyone has a past.
Not like mine.
 You don't know
half the things
I've done, Christina.
 My kids read.
Their friends read.
I can't take that chance.
 Look,
if you don't want to run,
then you shouldn't.
 I do wanna run.
I wouldn't have
 let it go this far
if I didn't want it.
 Then maybe it's a good thing,
 confronting your past,
even for your kids.
 They're a lot stronger
than you give them credit for.
 Look,
if Underwood, if the DNC,
 if they all think
you can do it, then...
 I don't care what they think.
I care what you think.
 I think you'd be great.
 So, she really wants this?
 That's the impression I got.
 What about ego?
I don't need to be
dealing with a diva.
 She's not a diva,
 she's
an award-winning journalist
with 15 years experience.
 You told me
she treated you like shit.
 There was some friction.
 So why are you
going to bat for her?
 Don't we want to work
with the best people?
 Plus, it'd be big
for the site.
 The Herald's
senior political writer?
 Sure, but she's so old guard.
Everything's by the book.
 There's no bite to it.
 She told me
about a profile
she's working on.
 It's got serious bite.
 What is it?
 She can tell you herself.
You should talk to her.
 Here's the deal.
 My children stay
out of the limelight.
 No photo ops, no press.
 We wouldn't dream of it.
 Okay.
 Let's do this.
 No.
 Where you from?
 Outside of Lynchburg.
 Virginia?
 Yeah.
 Are your parents
still living there?
No. I can't.
 If I find a place for
you to stay for a while,
 can I count on
you to be smart?
 What kind of place?
A nice place.
 A safe place until
we can figure out
something permanent.
 But I need to know
that you won't pull
anything like this again.
 Promise me.
 I promise.
 Look at me when you say it.
 I promise you.
 How you doing on money?
 I don't have
enough for tomorrow.
 What are you doing?
 I thought you wanted me to...
 You said you were
done with that.
 I'll be in touch.
 If you own up to
some of the shenanigans,
 sweep the rest under the rug,
you might have a shot.
 How much do we
have to sweep under?
 Well, that kid had a talent
for covering his tracks.
 I've highlighted all the items
I think you should admit to.
 The rest
I wouldn't mention.
 It's a lot not to talk about.
 I need your help
with something.
Right now?
 Yes.
Is it important?
 Because you told me
I could leave
early this weekend
 to go visit my daughter
down in Virginia.
 You have a guest room
in your house, right?
 Well, it's Mary's
old room, but, yes.
 I need you to put
someone up for a while.
A young woman.
 What? Who?
 Her name is Rachel.
 I can't tell you
anymore than that.
 I don't understand.
Why do you need...
 No questions, Nancy.
I just need you
to do this for me.
 I wouldn't be asking
if it weren't serious.
 Put up for how long?
 I don't know.
It could be a while.
 I'm supposed to put
up a complete stranger
and not ask any questions?
 Nancy, please.
You're the only
person I can trust.
 Is something illegal going on?
 No.
She's just a girl in trouble
who needs a place to stay.
 We have to be discreet.
 Can I at least meet her first?
 I need to know now.
 Okay, I guess.
 Thank you.
 There's no catch,
Larry.
 Your district
gets over $20 million
if the numbers hold.
 And most of
the money is earmarked
 for economic development,
not research.
 That's great, but I need
more than your support.
 I need you
to be a sponsor.
 Fantastic, Larry.
 Great. I'll put you down.
 You too. Bye.
 So that just leaves
Clayburn and Price?
 With Jennings on the fence.
 And I know Roger.
I'll call him.
 And I'll track
down these other two
over the weekend.
 Really good work today, Peter.
 Do you know
where I put my purse?
 It's right here.
 Did you make those?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.
 This?
I've been fooling
around with it a little bit.
 Can I see?
 Sarah learned how
to make these birds
in her art class.
 Then she taught it to Kevin,
and they got obsessed,
 and there were
little pieces of paper
all over the apartment.
 Do you wanna take
them for the kids?
 No. I can't.
 Please.
I'll just throw
them out eventually.
 Thank you.
They'll love them.
 So you should bring
the kids by the house
sometime so I can meet them.
 Kevin and Frank can
play the video games.
 He told you that?
 I was a little surprised,
I have to admit.
 If anybody knew he came
home every day to...
 It's embarrassing.
 There's worse secrets to have.
 Yeah, there are, I suppose.
 I'll call you Monday
after I talk to
Clayburn and Price.
 Okay, great.
Have a good weekend, Peter.
 You too.
 I had Linda talk to
the Vice President.
 He'll keep his nose
out of it.
 I appreciate that.
 He's a good man,
but this is a very delicate
moment in the campaign.
 He starts
spreading doubts, and...
 He's a pain in the ass.
 We all know it.
You don't have to
mince words, Frank.
 I have to say, sir,
the Vice President
has a point.
 I'm not 100% sold on Russo.
 Do we really wanna go
with someone this untested?
 Frank?
 We're grooming him, sir.
 When do you announce?
Next month.
 That's not enough time.
 What do you see in him?
 I was wondering
the same thing.
There's not that much to see.
 What I see is
a recovering alcoholic
with a history of drug abuse.
 What?
Excuse me, Frank?
 But he's clean now.
Has been for a year.
 This is a redemption story,
Mr. President.
 This is a bright young man
who's put his
life back on track.
 Now he wants to
help put Pennsylvania
back on track.
 Drugs, Frank?
 People love an underdog,
Linda,
 and people love someone
who stands up
after they've fallen.
 Combine those two,
it's a very
powerful narrative.
 All of our polling
indicates this is gonna work.
 You want us to endorse
someone with a history
of substance abuse?
 Let us get his story out there
and watch it
connect with the voters.
 All I care about
is a win, Frank.
 And I believe Russo
is our best chance.
 This is not a Hail Mary,
Mr. President,
 this is
a well-thought-out game plan.
 Mr. President...
 I realize that I sometimes
think out of the box,
 but the last time I did,
we signed an education bill.
 All right.
We won't stand in your way.
 But if it backfires,
Frank...
 I'll guide Peter
every step along the way.
 We will not
disappoint you, Mr. President.
 Okay.
 Thank you, sir.
 Linda.
 I didn't plan on telling them
so much so soon,
 but if I didn't,
Linda would've swayed him.
 There's no better way
to overpower
a trickle of doubt
 than with a flood
of naked truth.
 This is why the Education Bill
was so important.
 It bought me influence
precisely when
I needed it most.
 How long have you
been drinking?
 A long time.
Since I was a kid.
 How old were you
when you had your first drink?
 Nine.
 Nine years old?
Yeah.
 My dad gave me a beer
for my ninth birthday.
 When did you first
start using drugs?
 I won't go into
too many specifics
 other than to say
I had a few minor brushes
 with marijuana and cocaine
in the past but not recently,
 and only a handful of times.
 No other drugs
besides marijuana and cocaine?
 No.
 Under what circumstances?
 Occasional social gatherings.
That's the most I'll say.
 Ever while you were
in public office?
 No. Never.
My chief problem
was alcohol.
 And you've been
sober how long now?
 A little over a year.
 And what made you
want to get sober?
 Two things.
 My children, whom I love
more than anything
else in the world,
 and my renewed faith in God.
 Zoe.
 Lucas.
 I was just in
the neighborhood,
and I thought...
 No. That's a lie.
I was at the bar
around the corner.
 The one with the...
 And I remembered that time
that I dropped
you off after work.
 I knew it was...
 This block.
 And I buzzed,
and then I waited...
 You're wasted.
 I'm pretty wasted.
 Do you wanna know a deep,
dark secret?
 Now we don't
work together...
 Anymore.
 Lucas...
 I'm really flattered.
 But I'm just not in a place
 where I'm even thinking
romantically right now.
 I'm sorry.
 I...
 Yeah.
 Hey, hey!
 You want me to
pull up now, sir?
 I still have my key.
 I'll be in the kitchen
if you need anything.
 Thank you.
 Hey, I got us wine,
but I can't find
a corkscrew anywhere.
 Give it to me.
 I need a pen.
 The pen
the President gave you?
 That'll work.
 Did you talk to Ms. Skorsky?
 I did.
She said it was intense.
 I think Carly's
gonna offer her
a job at Slugline.
 Was that your doing?
 Janine expressed interest.
 I took the next step.
 Well done. Always
good to be owed favors.
 I was wondering.
Do you ever
think about my age?
 No. Does my age bother you?
 You must have other lovers,
men that are younger than me.
 No.
Not that I would mind.
 I am married,
after all.
 I don't have time
for other lovers.
 Hmm.
 Shit.
 It's turned.
Give me that.
 You could've
just stepped on it.
 I have asked the super
to get
an exterminator in here,
 and he won't do it.
 So any time I see a cockroach,
or a spider, or whatever,
 I try and trap it,
and then I leave
it by his door.
 You really ought
to get your parents
to let you borrow some money.
 Then you wouldn't have to
live in the third world.
 I would never
take money from them.
 Because they don't have it,
or because you don't want it?
 Because I don't want it.
 It's Father's Day, you know.
 It is?
 You should call your father.
 I'll call him tomorrow.
 Tomorrow you'll
be the daughter
that forgot Father's Day
 instead of
the one who remembered.
 Go ahead.
Call him.
 Hey, Dad.
Sorry it's so late.
 'Cause you weren't home
the last time I called her.
 There's so little
she'll ever reveal to me
or I to her.
 I bet her father
knows even less.
 I'm sure she's speaking
half an octave higher.
 Same voice she had
when she was 16.
 Telling him all
about her new job,
how much she misses him,
 and sorry she didn't
send a card.
 Telling him everything
but the truth.
 Just like she wouldn't
tell me about that
young man downstairs.
 I'm calling now,
all right?
 You're gonna make
me feel bad about it.
 It was the best thing
that could've happened.
 I didn't fit in there.
 I've been called worse, Dad.
 There's a value
in having secrets.
 Creatures like myself,
like Claire, like Zoe,
 we wouldn't be
ourselves without them.
 But Peter Russo,
on the other hand,
he's trapped by his secrets.
 What I'm trying to do
is give him the opportunity
 to set himself free.
 I don't know.
 I don't know yet.
 After all, we are nothing
more or less than
what we choose to reveal.
 What I am to Claire is
not what I am to Zoe,
 just as Zoe is not to me
what she is to her father.
 Probably Thanksgiving.
 'Cause I don't think I can
make it back before then.
 Okay. I'll try.
 I said I'll try.
 For Christmas?
 No.
 Uh-uh.
 No. I'm not seeing
anyone right now.
 I don't feel like it.
 Because I'm not
interested in that.
 I would tell you, Dad.
 Uh-huh.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Don't be worried about me.
I'm fine.
 Yeah.
 Dad, I'm in...
 I'm in a really
great place right now.
 I'm gonna try.
 I'm gonna try to come,
okay?
 Happy Father's Day.
 Aren't you gonna
wish me a happy Father's Day?
 You don't have any children.
 Don't I?
