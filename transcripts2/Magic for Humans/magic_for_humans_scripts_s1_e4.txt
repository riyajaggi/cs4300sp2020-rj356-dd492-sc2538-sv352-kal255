 [Justin] I know nothing about crystals. Make me know things. [woman] So this is known as the magician's stone. Tapping into the energy of this will open up your third eye. - Hold this in your left hand. - Okay. Okay. I'm just going to pull out a tarot card at random here. I'm not going to let you see it. Hold your right hand flat. No peeking. - Put the stone up to your third eye. - Okay. And open your third eye. And without looking at the card, just see if you can intuit which tarot card you're holding.

 - What do you think it is? - I'm feeling like it's the Empress. - The Empress? - Yes. Open your eyes. Bring the stone down. Let's take a look. - I'm psychic. - You did it! Oh, my gosh! -Got the Empress. - You're good! - Yes, I am! My goodness. 20 bucks? - Yeah. - I'll take it. Look at these. Are those real? No. - Is that a real elephant? - No.

 [Justin] My parents used to tell me, "Don't believe everything you see." - Who brought you those? - The Easter Bunny. Of course, they also told me the Easter Bunny was real. A chocolate egg! And I believed them. Why wouldn't I? I had proof. There were eggs all over the house. I believed in Santa 'cause there were presents under the tree, and I knew the Tooth Fairy was real 'cause in the morning that tooth... had turned to money. If the tiniest bit of evidence will make us believe the unbelievable, what would I have to show someone to make them believe the impossible? To find out, I set up an experiment. What's up, everybody? First, I placed an ad on Craigslist to recruit some help, and then I told them my plan. You guys are going to help me convince a dude that he's invisible. Yes! For real. I chose feature players. - What's your name? - Doug. Doug, drink as much of the water as you can, but don't swallow it. Kelsey, you'll kind of be right here, and Katy, you'll take a picture like this. Mike, you're gonna do something really important. No matter what the person does, this audience is going to pretend they cannot see them. Once all the roles were assigned, I put on a little magic show to attract an unsuspecting subject. This is a trick I used to do at kids' birthday parties when I was 12. And it wasn't long before we had a taker. First, I had to convince him that invisibility was real. You guys familiar with the concept of invisibility? Yeah! - The water, visible, yes? - Yes. We can see it. We can hear it. But when it becomes invisible... What! Take the bottle. Take a sip. It is invisible now, but swish it around and it becomes... visible. So far so good. - Should we try it with people? - Yeah! - Feeling it? - Oh, yeah. - What's your name? - Jonathan. Come on up here, Jonathan. Give it up for Jonathan! Number one, you can take a seat, Jonathan. - You feeling it? - Yeah. - What's your name? - Mike. Mike. Give it up for Mike and Jonathan. Now for the real convincer. We've got two men and a blanket. - You guys ready to do this? - Let's go! Let's do it! All right. Here we go. Mike, sit up straight. I'm going to cover you up. Here we go. Don't move. Let's make him invisible on the count of three. One... two... three! And Jonathan is now a believer. You ready? - No. - Here we go. I'm going to cover you up. Invisible on the count of three. One... two... three! Oh, my God! They did not vanish. You cannot see them or hear them. Let me show you. With your right hand, I want you to grab this can. I feel you. Don't let go. I've got it. There we go. Perfect. Nice holding onto it. That's perfect. I'm going to grab it. Jonathan, we can't see you or hear you, but will you just grab the can? Yeah. There we go. And now for the fun part. Shoot, I'm sorry. This will just take one minute. It's an emergency. Hey, it's Justin. I'm sorry. - Are you ready? - Yeah. One, two, three. - Oh, my God. - Can I see it? Let me see. - Oh, man! - It's insane! It's so cool. There must be a trick floor. Jonathan was not the only one who stumbled into my little experiment. Meet Brandon. Grab the can for me. - I'm right here. - Grab the... There we go. Perfect. There we go. - Stargate? - Yeah, kind of a Stargate thing. Hello? Can not anybody hear me? What the ****! Hi! Where did the guy go? Where is he at? Hi, hello? - You saw what happened. - I know, but I was sitting and, like... No, this is not happening. Oh, I don't know what the **** to do. Hi. Excuse me... Hi. Hello? Can you see me? What the hell? ...magic. I'm saying there's some kind of gate... Yeah. Which one? - The bottle is floating. - Whoa! Freaking hell! What is his name? Josh? Hi. And now it's time to bring them back. Mike, I'm going to bring you back first here. No... - Mike is not there. - Where's Mike? All right. Brandon first. We'll do Brandon first. Yeah, yeah, yeah! One, two, three! Yes! Bro, that was wild! It took a lot of work to make those guys believers, but sometimes all it takes is a few fancy words and a breath mint. You know how they say we only use 10% of our brains - at any given moment? - Yeah. I designed a pill that actually lets you unlock your brain. They say it's as harmless as a Tic Tac. How would I take... Oh, as a Tic Tac. Just let all the Maltodextrin beta Fluoride just zing. Magnesium sulfate... kind of rushing to the brain. Magnesium sulfides go to your brain. You feel smarter? You look smarter. - Let's try something. - Okay. Now the pill is into your blood system and the medication is taking effect... Hold this. Put your hand on top. Just give it a little shake. Don't drop it. Oh, yeah. You feel the weight? - Yeah. - Okay. Don't let go. I want you to tell me how much money you think is in there, using your mind. You give me how many dollars. You give me the cents. Okay. - $27. - And? And 18 cents. - $27 and 18 cents? - Yeah. Unscrew the top. You're really good. - You don't have to count it. I wrote it. - What? - Show the camera. - That's so crazy. Oh, my gosh! - What? No! - That's wild. What? 250. - $250? - Yes. - Even? - Even. Unscrew the top. I won't make you count it. I actually wrote it on the inside. $200.23. - You feel good? - Yes. Ooh, you're good. Unscrew the top. $200.23. I won't make you count it. I wrote how much money's in there on the lid. - Whoa! - It's still there. - How's it going? - Good. - I'm Justin. - Angela. Hi, Angela. You're on Trick Questions. I'm going to show you a trick then ask a question. - Okay. - Are you ready to play? - Yes, I am. - Here we go. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Where is it all going? Okay, so here's the question: Why did Harry Potter spare Gollum's life? - [woman 1] I'm scared. - [woman 2] I can't see. - Calm down, Jasmine. - I don't trust this. - Did you feel it? - What are we eating? - Excuse me! - I'm eating it. It smells good. - What is this? - Girl, eat the chicken. It's good. This tastes like fish. This is fish? Welcome to dining in the dark. Here at Opaque Restaurant, people eat dinner in complete, total darkness. I don't know how much I'm putting on. They can't see where they are, who they're with, or what they're eating. I'm the world's first restaurant tableside naked magician. - Wow. - There we go. Does it freak you out to know that I'm naked? - Long as you're just not by my food. - Yeah, man. The problem with magic in the dark is if you can't see it, you don't believe it. Ashley, name a card. Queen of spades. Did I get it right? - Jasmine, is it right? - I can't see! I can't see, either. It isn't just dark. You cannot see anything. - How many fingers am I holding up? - Gonna guess four. You were right. To compensate, I had to do magic they could feel. Watch the spoon. Ready? Check it out. - What? - Now, listen... It's a fork now! - No, it's not a fork! - It's a fork! When you can't see anything, your other senses actually get heightened. Let's exploit that. - You've known each other a long time. - Right. I bet you can feel each other's feels, right? - Yes. - Bryan, I'm going to come behind you. Okay. Now, Andrew... When you feel something, say "yo." Whoa. - Yeah. - What did you feel? Someone touching my left ear. You feel anything, I want you to say "hey." - Me? - Yeah. Yes, I feel something! Yes, I feel... - I feel... something. I do! - Oh, no... - Not doing that! - I felt something! I was skeptical at first, but this last trick proves that magicians should not be afraid of the dark. - Hey, Jasmine? - Yes? I've got a plate here. Would you just take your right hand and just feel what's on the plate? - Okay. Should I take one? - What is it? - Rocks? - No. - Seashells? - No. Oysters? - Nuts. - Oh! I want you to pick any walnut. And then just hold it in the palm of your left hand. You got one? - Yeah. - All right, Ashley? - Yes? - Can I borrow your ring? - Sure. - Yeah? - Sure. - Okay. Here we go. Okay. I'm going to drape a napkin over it. Okay. - Okay. Feel that? - Yes. With your right pincher fingers, I want you to just pinch your ring through the cloth. - Okay. - And then just hold it over to your right. Hold it right there. I'm going to count to three. When I get to three, I just want you to let go, okay? - Okay. - One, two, three. - Did you let go? - I did. - Did it fall on the table? - No, I didn't hear anything. I didn't feel it. Jasmine, did you feel anything in the palm of your left hand? - No. - Give the walnut a shake. - There's something in it. - I have a nutcracker here. - Have you ever used a nutcracker? - No. Okay. Well, this is the perfect first time. Okay. Keep the walnut in your left hand, nutcracker in your right hand, and you're going to put the nut right there. - Okay. - Okay? Keep your fingers out of the way and just kind of gently squeeze the jaws of that together until it cracks. Perfect. Now, reach inside the nut. There, in the shell, what is it? It's... Oh, my God, it's a ring. - What? - What in the hell? - Give it back. Ashley, is that your ring? - What? - Let me feel it. Oh, my gosh. - Is that your ring? This is my ring. - Do you have a dreamcatcher? - I have three. A dreamcatcher's supposed to catch the bad dreams while you're sleeping, yeah? I want to try something with you guys. I brought a deck of good dreams. These are things that I would love to have come true, like flying, - to meet the Muppets. - Yeah, that would be cool. Kiss a Muppet, to eat a Muppet. You know, cliché good dreams, but I have a blank one. I want one of you to write on it, a nightmare. Do either of you have a good nightmare? - Falling. - Falling? Falling down a cliff. - Falling down a cliff? - Yes. Take the card. - Will you write that on there? - All right. - Has that happened? - I've never fallen down a cliff, - but I've had the dream. - Let's keep it that way. Okay. Let's see. There we go. Falling down a cliff. It's a good bad dream. I'll take your bad dream and we'll just kind of... mix it in with the good ones here. We'll see if the dreamcatcher can can catch it. Watch the purple dreamcatcher. Are you ready? On three. One, two, three. - Wow! My gosh! - This is wild. I can't... - That's wicked. - Holy cow! How did you do that? - Hi, I'm Justin. - I'm Dina. Dina, it's very nice to meet you. This is Trick Questions. I'm gonna show you a trick. Pay attention because then I'm gonna ask you a question. - I'm ready. - Are you ready? Before I begin now, I must sanitize my hands. - This will be important later. - Okay. [car swerves] Dina... examine this light bulb. - Looks like a light bulb. - Legit? Yeah. Examine this nine-volt battery. Battery's good? Light bulb's good? Hands are sanitized? Will you lick my finger? Now, here's the question... What makes Ryan Gosling better than me? Nothing? [fake audience] Aww. Superpowers... Every kid wants them, but they know they aren't real. Today, I'm going to make them believe otherwise. - Do believe in superpowers? - Yeah, superpowers. - Yeah? - My favorite superhero is... all of them. I used to think my dad was a superhero 'cause he'd go out every night and come home with his clothes all disheveled. Mom used to say he was battling his demons. Huh? If you had one superpower, would it be solve world peace, get clean water to all of Africa, or be able to fly? - Give clean water to Africa. - Good choice. Now that the cameras aren't rolling, what power would it be? To be able to fly. So if you could have any superpower, what would it be? I want to make money come out of anywhere. The secret to having a superpower is just believing you have one. - Okay. - Here... What do we have? - Paper. - Paper. All right. All you have to do is believe that you can turn this paper into money, okay? - Okay. - Do you believe? Yeah. On three, snap your finger. If you believe, this will turn into money. You ready? One, two, three. Money! Can I have it, since I made it? - Yeah. - Thank you. Any other superpowers you want? - I want to turn things into chocolate. - Into chocolate? Like, turn this fidget spinner... into a chocolate. Just look at it and say, "Turn to chocolate," okay? Ready? Turn into chocolate. How did you do that? This is great. What other superpower would be cool? I want to freeze stuff with my breath. Got a quarter. Check it out. Make sure it's a real quarter. - What are your initials, by the way? - JTG. JTG? Okay, so write "JTG" on one side. Good. J... T... G. Now, in order to make something freeze with your breath, first we need... water, okay? So, take the water and pour a little bit of water in my hands. That's good. And now drop the quarter in there. Okay. Now freeze it with your breath. - How did you do that? - With your breath, buddy. Whoa! I would make things catch on fire with my mind. Fun! You know what these are? - What? - These are matches. Now, these are not for children to play with, okay? Okay, so I'll hold these up. What I want you to do is I just want you to stare at it, okay? See if you can imagine it catching fire. I want to turn a book into a lion cub. Into a lion cub? Not to chocolate? Are you sure? - No, I'm sure. - Okay. Grab a book. Okay. You don't want to turn it into chocolate? - You want to turn it into a lion cub? - Yes, I promise. Yes. - I want to turn it into a lion cub. - Okay. - What's inside? - What's in there? - Nothing. - No lion cubs? - No, but we're going to make magic, right? - We're going to make magic. Here we go... - Okay. Are you ready? - Yes. Stare at it. What's your magic superpower word? - Lion cub. - Lion cub. - Lion cub! - Lion cub! - Lion cub! - Lion cub! [lion yowls] I found something. Not again. You got any extra? We get the powers that we're born with. You've got to make the best of it. When my parents told me not to believe everything I see, but also that the Easter Bunny is real... Easter Bunny! It created a deep conflict inside me, and that conflict is what led me to become a magician. The cynic in me wants to know how the trick is done, but the child in me wants to believe it's real. I get to show skeptical grown-ups miracles every day, and if they're willing to believe just for a moment, it changes their world. But when you're a kid, you make your own miracles... and you believe them all. A child's gratitude for even the smallest moment of wonder is a true lesson in-- Can we just turn it into a real lion cub? ♪ Better believe shortie coming with me ♪ ♪ Even though she's saying no Can't keep her hands off of me ♪ ♪ I got money on my mind ♪ ♪ Been distracted by chic 'Cause they always want it better ♪ ♪ No matter what ♪
