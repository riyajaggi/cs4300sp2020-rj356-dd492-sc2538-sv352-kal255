 Hello? THOMAS: Sophia. It's me. What the hell were you thinking? That's really the first thing you want to say to me after 66 years? You almost killed 200 people. But nobody died, and you're free. Everything else is details. Not to me. And I am far from free. We have to assume that Martinez is doing

 everything in his power to track me. If only so I'II Iead them to you. You've drawn a lot of attention to yourself. Simon is gonna give us the details to their follow operation. We need to get you out so we can get started. There's a change of clothes in your bag. It's a safe bet that yours are compromised. And then what? Then I want you to wait for me to tell you what to do. Okay, she just passed the Van Ness Station. Next station is two miles. Metro Center. Very good, Mr. Murphy. PIease confirm with Andrews that the Predators have scrambled. Agent Lee, once the drones start transmitting video,

 I want it fed to your teams on the ground. SIMON: I'II set up a dedicated overlay, sir. Where are we? Sophia's train is proceeding east on the red Iine. Right now, it's approaching the Metro Center station. DAVID: Are we sure she's still on the train? We're getting a clear signal from the scandium 46 in her bloodstream. How Iong will the isotope stay active? Seven hours. If she hasn't Ied us to this man, Thomas, by then, we'II reacquire her. Thomas is the target of the operation, not Sophia. I don't want her hurt. Sophia has proven herself far from trustworthy. In my opinion, we must consider her a threat. She survives this, BIake. Am I clear? Pull me out if there are any major developments. Yes, Mr. President. Sir, I'd Iike to join my men in the field to supervise their deployment in person. Thomas, it's Simon. Hey, we have a problem. They've got a tracker in Sophia. In her? They put it in her food. It's a radioactive isotope. While it's active, they'II be able to track her wherever she goes. There must be some way to get it out. There isn't. But there may be another way to deal with it. Good. I'm counting on you. (CHILD CHATTERING) Hey! How was it? It's nice. You should come in. It Iooks rough. Okay, give me a kiss. No, it's warm, I swear. You'II Iove it. I Iike watching you. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. You Iook happy. Like a kid discovering water for the first time. Yeah, well... Where I'm from, there wasn't any. You never talk about your past. Well... When I'm with you, it doesn't matter. For the first time in my Iife, I'm free of it. I Iove you, Mason. I Iove you. I Iove you, too. Hey! Have Sophia get off at the Gallery PIace station and walk east. By that time, I'II know if this will work. THOMAS: Change of plans. They've deployed a radioactive isotope in your bloodstream. How? Your friend Martinez put it in your food. (MAN CHATTERING OVER P.A.) JUSTIN: Sir, she just got off at a stop. Location? Gallery. It's Chinatown. (PANTING) Get up to the street and take an immediate Ieft. MIKE: Command just reported the target exited the Gallery Place station. What's your position? We're three blocks away from the station and closing. Hold your approach, I don't want the team getting any closer. THOMAS: Ahead of you is 6th Street. You're gonna make a left, continue on. Across the street, you'll see the place I've been describing. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) Okay, she's onto 6th, crossing east, entering a building. Which is... JUSTIN: It's a coffee shop. Is it possible she's stopping for coffee? Thank you. JUSTIN: Target's holding. Is that... Is that right? Okay, we've got a second target. What do you mean, a second target? Is this right? I think so. Okay, now we have three targets. What the hell is happening? I don't know, sir. Okay, now we have five targets. They keep coming. Have Simon move his men in. Yes, sir. I knew you were Iooking for me. That's what kept me going. I need you to tell me what happened to my dad. To my family. ANGELA: What's your name? What's your name? I don't think so. I'II just ID you offyour fingerprints. Good Iuck with that. Mmm. Who is it that you work for? I need a doctor. I think I asked you a question. You can keep asking me questions all day, but if I bleed to death on your watch, you're gonna have a real problem, aren't you? You're right. But not as big a problem as you. I don't understand. What do you mean, the plane was pulled from the sky? That's what it felt Iike, Iike we were being moved by something. One second we were in Miami, the next, we were 2,000 miles away, crash-Ianding in Arizona. That just doesn't make any sense. You're right. I know. Well, I mean, my dad, how did he explain it? He didn't explain it. AImost right when we Ianded, there were these... Some kind of aircraft started moving in, and he said they weren't there to help us and that I needed to find you, so I just ran. Well, where is he? Where's my dad and the rest of the passengers? Well, they're saying on the news that they Iost track of the plane over in Brazil and that they're still Iooking for the passengers. AII I know is that the government is not telling us the truth. What about my mom? I mean, she must be Iooking for him. I tried calling the house at the police station, but no one was picking up. Leila, I... I have to... I have to tell you something. Your father told me that... That they killed your mom. What? I'm so sorry. What? I am so sorry. No. What about Samantha? The people who are behind this, they took her just Iike they took you, for the same reason. No. No! To force your dad to do what he did. No! They wouldn't... They can't hurt a Iittle girl, right? Tell me she's okay. As far as I know, she is alive. We'II find her, okay? We'II find her. I'II explain more when I see you, all right? Bye. What did you do to her? What? Where is she? I don't know. Who? My sister! Where's my sister? I don't know what you're talking about. PIease. PIease, just tell me, okay? Just tell me where she is. She didn't do anything. I don't know anything about your sister. Where is my sister? (SCREAMING) Where is she? Where is she? Get her off of me! Get her off of... Where's my sister? She's only seven! Where is she? Answer her or I will Iet you die here. I don't know anything! AII I know is I'm bleeding out in some fleabag motel! Let go! Where is she! You wanna blame somebody? Why don't you blame your father? That's right. You didn't know? He's no angel. Way I heard it, he brought this on himself. We're still being flooded by false targets. Forty-three and counting. Now how is that possible? Well, best guess, one of Thomas' people got here ahead of us. We don't have enough manpower to track everyone who's been dosed. No, but we can minimize the confusion. Lock down the coffee shop. That's a good idea. Use DaSilva, Rutherford, Berdan and Hayes. What's our story? Possible homeland security threat in the vicinity. No reason to panic. That one doesn't work as well as it used to. Better be compelling then. The rest of you, resume the search. Set a half-mile perimeter and work your way back. Sophia's on foot. She can't have gotten far. Let's go. SOPHIA: Coming up on Spring Street. (DOG GROWLING) (BARKING) THOMAS: We need to keep you away from the CCTV cameras. We can avoid most of them. But there are areas of vulnerability. So keep your head down. Somebody give me a hard count on the isotope targets. Fifty-nine and holding, sir. Continuing to disperse. One of those targets is Sophia. I want an immediate override on all CCTV and traffic cameras in the area. Once they re-route, port it directly to facial recognition. Uploading now, sir. Sir. May I have a word? (SIGHS) What's going on? Whoever dosed the people at the coffee shop did it with the same isotope we used on Sophia. And? Scandium 46 is hard to source, so I checked our own stockpile. Forty minutes ago, someone walked out of our on-site armory with 100 cc's of Iiquid scandium. Who's authorized to access the armory? Only the men on our field teams. I'm sorry, sir, but it has to be one of them. Good news is scandium is a volatile particulate. Anyone who's handled it will have trace amounts on them. I can vet the field teams with a radiation detector. Do it. We need to find the traitor before he undermines the entire operation. Yes, sir. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Agent Lee. Lee, we have a situation. I'm heading your way. A situation? What are you talking about? Just gather the members of your field team and hold them there until I arrive. We're in the middle of an operation here, what is this about? I'll fill you in when I get there. Let's just say you have a problem. I'm gonna get you in that water next time we go there. I Iike Iooking at the water. I don't need to get immersed in it. Yeah. So what do you say we eat in tonight, huh? I'II pick up some fish from the market. Sound good? Yeah, sounds perfect. AII right. Hey, Mason, will you pick up some sunflowers? Sunflowers? What do you want sunflowers for? They Iight up the house. Okay. I'II Iight a fire. AII right. (SIGHS) What are you doing here? I think you know. PIease, Thomas. I'm not ready. It's time to go now. Look, I have a Iife here. Staying in one place any Ionger than we already have is not an option. For any of us. How much Ionger do you think it's gonna be before people start to notice you're not getting any older? I don't know, okay? I'II figure out a way to make it Iook Iike I am. I'm telling you the way it's gonna be. Thomas, come on. PIease... What's the problem? I fell in Iove. Now who in the hell told you to do that? I had no control over it, okay? It just happened. And I'm not Ieaving her. Ifyou don't go, she'II have to. It's my job to get us home, and I can't do that without your help. Don't Iet your people down. Yeah, well, just Iet me say goodbye then. Just Iet me say goodbye. It's over. I'm sorry. Are all team members present? I got them waiting out front. I hope there's a good reason for this. We have a traitor. What are you talking about? Someone took the scandium that was used to dose the coffee shop from our armory. Are you sure? Positive. The only people with armory access are the field teams. Whoever did it should still be giving off trace Ievels of radiation. I don't believe one of my men would do this. But that is the case, now we need to scan them. Hold, hold... Hold on. Let me do it. My men will take it better if it's coming from me. AII right. Agent Lee. Someone needs to check you. Are you questioning my Ioyalty? Everyone on the team, Sterling's orders. Let's just get it out of the way. He was just trying to mess with you, that's what these people do. What if what he said is true, what if they chose my father for a reason? Look, we have to go to my parents' house and find something that connects him to all of this. I don't think you're gonna be able to find anything there. These people will make sure that there is nothing to find. So, then what are we supposed to do? Well, Collier's called her ex-husband. He's gonna Iock that guy down and get you someplace secure, okay? What are you gonna do? There's a federal murder warrant out on me. They think I killed Greg. But Collier knows that you didn't do that. She believes you. But it's her word against the evidence, which she says they made Iook airtight. So I need to find the people behind this so I can clear my name, and so I can find out about your father and Samantha. And you, you're just gonna stay safe and get help. You need some time to heal. I'm not going to heal until I know about my family. I'm going. Leila, Iisten to me. You're the most important thing in the world to me. I'm not gonna put you at risk. I don't need to be protected right now, okay? I need to do something. I'm not gonna Iet you just put me in some place while you're out there Iooking for my family. Listen to me. I'm just not gonna do that. I'm going. Where's the ambulance? I'm sorry, was somebody supposed to call one? Where is it? I heard you call one. Come on, check on it. You're just an expert at making friends now, aren't you? Where is it? I don't know. Maybe they put murderers at the bottom of the Iist. Don't Iook at it. Let's go, Iet's go. Let's go. I'm so sorry. Where do you wanna start? There's gotta be something in his office that will help us. Come on. Just Iook through everything. Leila. There's gotta be something here! AII right, we'II find it, we'II find it. (GASPING) Sam's baby clothes. I was the only one who could put her to sleep. What? The attic. What? The attic! There. What is this stuff? I don't know. You shouldn't have come here. THOMAS: What is it? Hey, my cover's blown. Sterling's aide made me. Can't you take care of him? He's out cold in the trunk of his car. Why didn't you... I wasn't going to kill him, Thomas. And it wouldn't have mattered anyway. Dead or alive, it's over. Then it's time to move on again. (PANTING) (GRUNTS) Hey! What's up, Mike? Where you headed? I don't know. Home, I guess. No, no, no. No, wait, come on, we gotta celebrate, man. We made it through training. Well, this is true. (BOTH LAUGH) I can't believe you actually requested to be stationed in AIaska. What is that about? Man, I'm a snowbird. AIways have been. Mason? Mason? MIKE: Simon, you okay? Mason? It's me. It's Violet. (EXCLAIMING) How can it be? You haven't aged a day. MIKE: Simon, you know her? I... I think she's... I apologize. She suffers from AIzheimer's. She gets people and places mixed up. Mason, it's me. It's me. It's me. MIKE: Ma'am, you got the wrong guy. No. Hey, hey, Simon, come on. I'm sorry. You must have me confused with someone else. No. Don't Ieave. PIease. Get me a picture on the center screen, please. Yes, sir. Let's see what he's got. When were these taken? TECHNICIAN: Ten minutes ago. Redirect all teams immediately. And pull up all the adjacent cameras. Tell me you found her. Mr. President, a traffic camera just spotted Sophia heading east. It was on a time delay. We don't have her yet, but we're closing in. There you are. TECHNICIAN ON RADIO: Target seen entering a building 0.7 miles east of the Takoma Playground. MIKE ON RADIO: Copy that. Alpha en route. Thomas, they've spotted Sophia. She's gonna Iead them straight to you. How Iong until you get here? You can't wait. You gotta get out of there now! Don't worry. Just get here. I have a contingency plan. What are you talking about? What the hell are you... Thomas! Damn it! (PHONE CLICKS) We have a Iot to talk about. But for now, I'm happy to see you. I need to know how much of your father's file you've seen. How much do you know? We don't know anything. We just found it. Then it may not be too Iate. Put the file on the floor. SIowly, and slide it toward me. Okay. Do not move or I will shoot you! Do you understand? My mother is dead, and my family is missing. What's in this file might have something to do with it. We're not giving it to you. (STAMMERING) Don't... Don't shoot. You can have the file. Sean! Okay? I'm not Ietting you get shot! Okay? You can have it. Here you go. Drop it. Drop it! AII right. Upstairs. Move! SEAN: Who the hell are you? And don't Iie to me. I don't Iie. I don't Iie. My name is Madeline Jackson. I'm a journalist. Used to be. Till I saw the Iight that trying to speak the truth is a waste of time because nobody wants the truth, people don't want the truth, God forbid, or it would all go down in flames. It's the Iies that keep the construct going, don't you see? Spread by the vested interests in the government and the private sector and the churches and the stock exchanges. AII fabricating and spinning and telling stories that keep 300 million consumers happy and stupid and spending. Why are you Iooking at me Iike I'm crazy? Just stop. I'm not the deluded one. You are. Why are you here, and what does this have to do with my father? Okay. Back to the beginning. Two years ago, your father contacted me about a flight he was piloting to Anchorage. Weather forced him to divert, and by accident, he saw that from the file. It's a non-Iisted government facility near Inostranka, middle of nowhere. He was curious. And he read an article that I'd put on a site that I had. That was before they took away my site. That they hacked it out of existence, because they didn't want anyone to know. "They" who, the government? The government are scared Iittle children compared to the forces that want this kept a secret, do you understand? Your father knew too much. So they took him. Don't you see? SEAN: No. No, I don't understand. Honestly, you seem out of your mind. I am not out of my mind. Listen to me... So why don't you just tell us what her father knew? Okay? It's your funeral, okay? In 1944, an aircraft crashed over the Brooks Range in AIaska. The government imprisoned the survivors in a facility they built especially for them. Why? What did they do? It's not what they did, it's who they are. Who are they? EBEs. Extraterrestrial biological entities. AIiens. Four minutes ago, we got visual of Sophia heading into this building. These were taken at the same building two hours earlier. This is the best resolution we've been able to get. That's him. Right there. Thomas. I know it. AII our field units are en route. We'II have the building surrounded within minutes. Thomas? Thomas! MIKE ON RADIO: Attention all units. Stay close. Target in sight. ETA about two minutes. Damn it. Thomas! (SIRENS BLARING) (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) Hey, Thomas! Sophia! FBI TEAM LEADER: Execute, execute, execute! Thomas! Sophia! Come on. Thomas! Hey, Thomas, Sophia. They're right behind us. Every field team in the D.C. area. Don't worry. No, you don't understand. This place is gonna be crawling with agents. It won't take them any time at all to find that and come after you. I told you, don't worry. (RUMBLING) What have you done? We have to go now. Thomas, call it off. Now. I can't. It's too Iate. This is it, Simon. Thomas... I promise you, there's nothing I can do. We gotta go. Simon, you have to come with us now. It's too Iate for you to go back. You have to come with us now! I'm sorry. PIease! Simon, come! (MEDICAL EQUIPMENT BEEPING) Mason? A sunflower. I know how much you Iike them. How they used to Iight up the house. Oh! Are you an angel? No. I'm so far from that. But you're here. I'm here. Oh. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for everything. PIease forgive me. I waited for you. For so Iong. Did you Iove me? I never stopped Ioving you. If it were up to me, we would have gotten married. We would have had children. We would have grown old together. But it was up to you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Simon! PIease. (GASPS) MIKE ON RADIO: Simon, are you in here? This is Agent Lee. Evacuate the building now! It's an order! (GRUNTING) (FBI TEAM MEMBERS CHATTERING) Everybody out of here! FBI TEAM LEADER: AII teams, fallback! Oh, God! Oh, my God! You guys! Get out of here! Get your men out of here! Oh, God. You're all right. I'm gonna get you out of here. Hold on a second! Hey! Anybody! (LOUD WHIRRING) I need help! Hold on, buddy! Hold on! Anybody! Mike, help me out here, man! I got you. Come on, we gotta get him out of here! What the hell... Come on! I need you! Let's go! Hang on, buddy! Hang on! We got you. Let's go, Iet's go! Come on! Look out! We gotta go over! I got him! Got him? Yeah. SIMON: Let's go! No! Mike! Go! Come on! Go, I'II be right behind you! Just go! Come on! Come on! (COUGHING) Simon? Simon! Simon!
