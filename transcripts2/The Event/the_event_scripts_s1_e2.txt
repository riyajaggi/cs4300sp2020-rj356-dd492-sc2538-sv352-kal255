 - 97. - What'd you think? You were just gonna keep running this thing without my knowledge? Welcome to Mount Inostranka. He's going to tell them. About the event. You need to sit down, please. He's got a gun! Whatever they promised you, you can't trust them. The attack is already underway. We have to evacuate. Ooh. I haven't told you everything. What the hell just happened?

 Are you okay? Are you all right? Michael! Michael! Oh, my God, there's fire. - Michael! - There's a fire. There's a fire in the back. Get the fire extinguisher. Yeah, we got to get everyone out right now. - We need to get everybody out. - Everybody out. Everybody get out of the plane. Fold your arms and jump. Get off the plane. There's a fire. Come on. Let's go, go! I want everyone to stay calm and get out of the plane. All right, go, go, go. - Come on. Move. - Come on! Move away from the plane! Make room for everybody else. Everybody's gonna get out. Michael! Ma'am, you gotta get off the plane. To the left! Come on, let's go! - Stay calm. - Come on. One at a time, one at a time. - Aah! - Everybody's gonna get out. - Go! Ahh! - Go, go, go! I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine. Go. I'll get him. Go, go. Come on. - Unh! - Oh! Here. Here just-- Okay, just stay on your side. Look. There's one more. Look. Michael! Michael! I won't do it. I can't. Stop wasting time. You know what we're capable of. You will fly that plane. Say it. Say it. Vicky, what do you want? Sit down. God! Oh, my little baby. Baby. God, what do you want? You watched us kill your wife. Do you really think we'd hesitate to do the same thing to your daughters? One word from me, she pulls the trigger. Tell me again you're not gonna do it. That you're not gonna fly the plane. Go on. I'm waiting. Michael. Michael. What happened? What happened? I-I had no choice. They killed Val. - They were gonna kill the girls. - What? They had a gun to Leila's head. They were gonna kill her right in front of me. Who? Who? Who has Leila? Leila knew who was holding her. Called her Vicky. Vicky? You sure? Tall, dark hair? You saw her? - Yeah. - Where? Where--where are they holding her? I don't know. They had me blindfolded. Somewhere in Miami. Look! Hey, hey, look! Help is coming. That's not help. What do you mean? You can't trust anyone. You're the only one that can help her. You have to find Leila. You're hurt. I'm not gonna leave you. You still might have time to save her. But you have to go now. Wait. No, no. Go. Go. Go and find her. Go. ♪ The Event 1x02 ♪  To Keep Us Safe Original Air Date on September 27, 2010 == sync, corrected by elderman == == for www.addic7ed.com == Get her out of here! Lock the reporters down. No phones. No cameras. Go! It's okay. It's okay. Baby, it's okay. We're safe now. It's okay. What happened? Were people trying to kill us? Hey, look at me. I don't want you to worry about that right now. All right? We're gonna be okay. Yeah. I'll keep us safe. I promise. It's okay. Perimeter! This way, Mr. President. David, you go with mommy. Take my family to the bunker. I'll join them shortly. Sir, protocol is to keep-- Just get them safe now. See you in a minute. You two, go, move. What do we know? Copilot managed to transmit a message before communications went down. The plane's pilot, a man named Michael Buchanan, was hijacking the aircraft and apparently planned to crash it in the presidential compound. Sir, we need to keep moving, please. Right now I'm less concerned with who tried to kill us than who saved us. I know what I saw. That plane was coming right at us until it wasn't. I mean, it vanished. We've locked down the air traffic controllers and everyone at Coral Gables who saw what happened, and nothing was broadcast live. We're discrediting scattered reports from people in the general vicinity who are being told that the plane was obscured when it flew into a mid-altitude marine layer. What helps is everyone knows that a plane can't just disappear into thin air. As far as everyone's concerned, Flight 514 is still en route to Brazil while we decide on an alternative narrative to tell the public. Meaning a cover-up. Protecting the country involves the keeping of secrets, Mr. President. It always has, and it always will. We need to focus on that plane and the people on it. There must be several hundred of them. What happened? Where are they? Mr. President, Mr. Sterling. Sir, we've been able to confirm there's no debris or signs of the plane in the vicinity of this incident. Now as our satellite redirects come in, we're able to widen our search here to neighboring states and other continents. But there is one interesting detail. Sergeant. A space-born sensor recorded an off-the-chart blast of electromagnetic radiation in the area at the exact time the plane went missing. This is what knocked out all the electronics in the site. The problem is, sir, that we have no idea what this means. Does our military have any weapon that could do this? No, sir. No branch of our armed forces or anyone else's has this capability. Then that leaves only one other group that could have done that to the plane. Ahem. Director Sterling, I'm ready when you are. Mr. President, let me appeal to you one last time to let this remain a matter for the intelligence services, which have been managing this without interference for decades. And we have our reasons. Blake, cut the B.S. I want everything. Go. In 1944, an aircraft of undeclared origin crashed in the Brooks Mountain Range of Alaska. Obviously, we were on a war footing at the time, and military forces were on hand soon after to lock down the scene. 97 survivors were apprehended, many of them wounded. These survivors were determined to be not of terrestrial origin. What? Agent Lee is part of the team overseeing the Inostranka facility. He'll brief you on the basics. Well, as you can see, outwardly, they look very much like us, which could indicate a common ancestor or even a parallel evolutionary process. But there are differences. Now, initially, scientists were only able to detect small variations in their circulatory systems and blood composition. But over time, it became clear that they age at a much slower rate than we do. Meaning there had to be substantial differences we couldn't detect and that we didn't understand. Now recent advances in DNA sequencing are starting to change that. We now know their DNA varies from ours by slightly less than 1%. 1%? So they're people. They're absolutely not. 1% is actually quite significant genetically. Chimpanzees' DNA differs from ours by only 2%, for example. Oh, my God. Hmm. And why are we holding them? Excuse me, Mr. President? Why are we holding them? Have they committed any acts of aggression? We're holding them because they refuse to tell us the truth. About who they really are, why they're really here, or what they really want. They have a hidden agenda, sir. I know it in my bones. Remind me to never eat squid again. I know. They make it sound so appetizing when they call it calamari. But I-I think in your case it was the mai tais. I didn't drink that much. I know you didn't, but... You should probably go soon. Nope. You are sick, and I'm not going anywhere without you. - You love snorkeling. - I know. I so love snorkeling. - Well, go. - I'm not gonna go. So... You are so thoughtful. And if I were feeling any better, I would reward that thoughtfulness. Mm. Tell me exactly what you would do. Be specific. I'll close my eyes. You can start wherever you want. Oh, come on. I'll be right back. One second. - Hey, where is she? - Hi. Vicky. Oh. Baby. Leila, do you feel so hung over? Uh, a little bit. Ugh, I hate that. Listen, I got your message. Yeah. But I came here to see if I could change your mind. 'Cause Greg went on this jungle excursion, and I could really use a diving buddy. - Uh, I think I'm just gonna-- - He's gonna go. You're going. - Yes. - Perfect. - Are you-- - Go. I'm fine. Go. Go. Get some shoes on. I'm gonna finish a book. I'll be fine. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, sweetie, I'm so worried about you. Get cozy, drink lots of water, and get plenty of rest, okay? Get better. You ready? - Yeah. - All right. - All right. - Let's go. - I love you. - I love you. Okay, I'll see you in a couple of hours. - Have fun. - Thanks. Don't forget about that thoughtfulness thing. I really want to finish that conversation. Take lots of pictures. - I will. - We will. Hmm. What'd you forget? Hey, hey, surprise. - Greg. - Yeah. I heard you were feeling sick, I felt bad, I wanted to swing by, you know, to see if you needed some company. Uh, yeah, you know, I just-- I think I just need to get some rest. Yeah, I mean, believe me, I've been there many, many times. Yeah, okay, well, I'll see you-- I got something for you. It'll make you feel better. Check this out. All we need--oh. I don't need anything. Yes. A-ha. One of these. And voila. Megadose of vitamin C makes all your hangover go away. Cheers. Thanks. But I really think I just need to close my eyes for a little bit. Yeah, lay back, close your eyes. This is guaranteed to make you feel better. Give me your foot. What? No. Come on. It's just a little massage. Just a little massage? Is that what you're gonna tell your girlfriend? Who? Vicky? What exactly do you think she and Sean are doing right now? Whoa! Hey. - Get out. - Come on. It's not that big a deal. - Greg, get out. - Seriously. If you don't leave, I will. Don't you think you're overreacting a little bit, Leila? I mean, I stopped by to, you know, check on you, make sure you're okay. You need to lighten up and relax first of all. Is there a problem? No. He was just leaving. No, no, there's no problem. See, there's nothing here that concerns you, my man. The lady wants you to go. Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. Greg, why don't you just leave? It's cool. I got it under control. The lady would like you to go. Everything's fine. You can take off, okay. Friend, you need to leave. Hey, buddy, I got this. Calm down, calm down. Just relax. Just relax. Grab her legs. Welcome back. Can you hear me? Are you feeling better? Where am I? You're in a hospital. A couple brought you in a little while ago. Their dog found you out in the desert about 20 yards from the road. They said you were pretty incoherent. You kept saying you were in a plane that crashed in the desert. Look right here for me. No, hey, it's okay. It's okay. We already checked. There have been no reports of any accidents or missing planes. You were severely dehydrated and suffering heat stroke, and that can cause confusion, but you're okay now. You're here, and you're safe. Where's here? St. Francis Hospital. But where? Where is that? Just outside of Yuma. What is that, Arizona? Yeah. Uh, I have to talk-- I have to talk to the police. My girlfriend was kidnapped. Look, it's gonna be okay. It's important you understand how serious heat stroke can be. No, no, no, listen, I'm not--I'm not delusional. The last time I saw my girlfriend, we were on a cruise. In Arizona? In Antigua. And there was a couple, and the woman is involved in the kidnapping. Look, where's the phone? I have to talk to the police right now. - Okay. - Please. - I think you need to calm down. - No, no, no. I need to talk to the police. Please. Can you get me a phone? Or can you show me where a phone is? Okay, listen, you just stay calm, and I'll call them for you. Okay. Yuma PD, Deputy Hodes, how can I help you? Hi, this is Leanne Timmons at St. Francis. I'm a nurse here, and I have a patient named Sean Walker. He wants to report a kidnapping, but he's got heat stroke, and he's extremely confused. So? So he insisted that I call you. And he was only gonna get more agitated if I didn't. All right. What was the name again? Sean Walker. This guy happen to be caucasian, 5'11", brown hair, mid to late 20s? That's right. It's a long shot... Did he mention anything about being in the Caribbean? He said he was on a cruise in Antigua. How did you know? Are you there with him now? What do you mean? Can he hear you? No. Okay, listen to me, this guy's wanted on a federal murder warrant. Your patient killed a man on that cruise ship. My God. What do I do? Just keep him there. Can you do that? Miss? Miss? Yes. He's on an I.V. He's not going anywhere right now. I'm sending officers over now. Okay. There's no question in my mind. Sophia's people were behind what happened to that plane. What? The 97 at Inostranka under lock and key? That doesn't seem likely. Which means there must be more of them out there. Sleepers. I always suspected it was a possibility. Now we know. Sophia swore to you that she and her group were the only ones of their kind here. Well, clearly, they are not alone. And whatever they did to that plane means they have technological capabilities we can't even comprehend. Where is she? Sophia. Where is she? Has she said anything? Not a word since being taken back into custody. With all due respect, she's been lying to us for six decades. What makes you think you're gonna get the truth out of her now? Open the door. President coming through. Base! Base, this is Red Seven. I have a visual on the crash site. Roger that, Red Seven. What are your coordinates? Sweet lord. Thomas! Thomas! Stay with her. It's gonna be okay. You're bleeding. It's nothing. Listen to me. They've spotted us. They'll be here soon. We have to move everyone out. No. There are too many wounded. We wouldn't get far. I need you to gather all the able-bodied and get ready to go. What about you? I can't abandon them. No. Unless you go, there's no hope for any of us. - There is if we fight. - Listen to me. I can't risk all of us being caught. We'll be together soon. I promise. Now go. Go. Hello, Sophia. When I woke up this morning, I thought I was gonna be making history. Announcing to the world that humanity was not alone, that I was freeing your people to integrate and live peacefully among us. Now I was told many times that I was making a mistake and that I didn't know your true agenda. Apparently some even felt so strongly they thought they'd try to kill me before I could make that announcement. And as it turns out, it would have been a mistake. So I'm asking myself over and over, was I just being naive? Or was I guilty of narcissism? Was I so intent on going down in history that I was blind to the truth? Now I'm asking myself the things-- Sophia, look at me. I'm asking myself these things because I know I need to take responsibility. And I'm gonna give you a chance to do that too, to tell me your reasons, good or bad, for deceiving me. All I can tell you is... That we mean you no harm. My people saved your life. Is that really what happened? Or were they saving your life? Sophia, how many more of you are out there? Why haven't they shown themselves before? And where the hell is that plane and the passengers? I can't tell you anything. I'm sorry. I don't want your apology. I want the truth. I'm done. The deal's off. You're going back to Inostranka. You and your people will stay there until I get the truth. That would be a mistake, Mr. President. My people have been waiting for 66 years. Their patience is running out. Is that a threat? You wanted the truth. I'm giving it to you. Just act natural. Did you call the police? Yes. They said they'd come in and take your statement. - Oh, thank you. - Out your girlfriend. Thank you. Oh, do you need to do something about that? Yeah. Is everything okay? Yeah. Of course. Nurse. All units, I want this place locked down. Suspect may be armed. Hey. What's going on? Why are ere cops everywhere? Please don't hurt me. I have a three-year-old son. - Why would I hurt you? - Please. They told me. Told you what? That you killed someone. What? Where is he? I thought I saw him. When did you see him last? Just, like, a few minutes ago, I think. There. He's over there. Last lap. Hold your strokes. Come on, Sean. Bring it in. Bring it in. Let's go. Let's go, everybody. Bring it home. Jimmy, come on! Great work. Okay, guys, hit the showers. Hey, I wasn't laughing at you. I just didn't want you to think-- Yeah, sure. No, I really wasn't. But, so you... Don't know how to swim. You got me. Wow, that's crazy. Thanks. No, no, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean it like that's... I just...It's... Embarrassing? Pathetic? No, no, no, no. No, it's cute. Um... So are you Captain of the swim team or something? No, no, no. Computer science society. It's lame, I know, but... No. It's cute. Um, you were in a negative position. That's why you weren't floating. - I was? - Yeah. You had your chin tucked to your che-- you know, your chin tucked to your chest. That's why the water was going above your head. It's not funny. And I should be more... You should be-- here. May I? Can I... Yeah. Okay, so this is neutral. And then you just put your ears under the water and your eyes go straight up to the ceiling. Okay. The water will help you float. There you go. There. Oh. Just like that. Just a little practice. - Close? - Yeah. Thanks. Sure. So... Thank you for the swim lesson. Yeah, sure, anytime you want... Um, how about tomorrow? - Around 5:00? - Okay. Really? Yeah. - Okay. - Meet me outside my dorm. It's the Meadow House. Okay. It's kind of hard to find. Everyone always gets lost. I'll find you. Okay. - Oh! - Hey, what is going on? Deputy, check that hallway. Go that way. Hey, did you see anybody run down this hall? I did not. FBI! That's far enough, Mr. Walker. Now if you could be so kind as to put those hands up. Mr. Walker, you're under arrest for the murder of Greg Kervin. Agent Lee. Sophia's been lying to us. This whole time they've been hiding an external population. I'm hand-picking a special operations unit, the best men, and I want you at the top. Me, sir? You've been assigned Inostranka for years. You probably know them better than anyone else. We need to figure out the full extent of their capabilities. It's not gonna be easy. They've been hiding among us in plain sight. God only knows how far we've been infiltrated. Sorry. Normally, I'm really good at this. It's not your fault. I have small veins. I got it from my mother. Well, if you got that smile from her, I'd say it was a fair trade. What sector did you apply for? Um, clandestine services. Mm. Everybody wants to be a spy. Yeah, well, I'm hoping for something in the field, but no one has told me if I'm even hired yet. Well, if you made it this far, you made the cut. Blood tests are just a formality. And success at last. Welcome to the CIA, Mr. Lee. We need to root them out. Every one of them. So do whatever you have to and find them. - Hey. - Good to see you, brother. Yeah. I only wish it were under better conditions. Look, now that they know about you, the prisoner release is off the table. And the President's people are intent on hunting everyone down. I warned you this would happen if we took the plane. Not to mention the extent to which our resources are drained for now. It was our only option. No, the military had jets in the air. We could have let them shoot the plane down. Look, killing almost 200 passengers was not acceptable. Not to you. Or Sophia. Is that the reason why you came down here? To warn me? I need to know about the plane. There's no sign of it. Really? You were supposed to set it down unharmed. Why hasn't there been any word from the passengers yet? Thomas, what happened? I decided that, since we had the passengers, we might as well use them. The plane's in Arizona. Here are the coordinates. You'll understand when you find it. What does that mean? And that's when they kidnapped Leila. To force her father to fly a plane into the President. Somebody must be covering it up. Maybe even the government. But it happened. I was on the plane. I tried to stop it. You're not gonna do this the entire way, are you? - Do what? - Talk. So you saved the President? No. Something else happened, and I-I can't explain it, but suddenly the plane was here in Arizona, and, yes, I know how that sounds, but I am telling you the truth. You know, I want to go back to the cruise ship where you killed Greg kervin. Why don't we talk about that? Okay, they must have-- they must have made it look like I killed him. Ah. Like they made it look like I was never supposed to be on the ship, like I imagined the whole thing. Okay, listen, the only person that I know is involved is the woman that I was telling you about, Vicky Roberts. She's the one who got me off the ship, and she's the one, last I heard, was holding Leila, so that's where you have to start looking. Wow. This must have been quite an undertaking. Think of all the people and planning involved. All focused on you. You must be a very important person to warrant all that. Why would I be making any of this up? Why? Just--why would I do that? Narcissistic delusion is common in any number of psychiatric illnesses. Based on your file, I pegged you as just a run-of-the-mill sociopath, but now I'm leaning more towards paranoid schizophrenic with a strong persecution complex. Wait a second. Wait a second. I came this way. - What? - I recognize those mountains from when I was lost in the desert. They're blocking the road because of the plane. Of course. No, it's-- that's where we landed. Over that rise. It's there. It's right there. We crashed right over that rise. It's there. What's going on? Semi jackknifed. Spilt its payload onto the road. Some kind of class four chemicals. Can't let anyone go through until it's cleaned up. Really? And how long is that gonna take? They tell me tomorrow morning at the earliest. We're detouring everyone to the 18. That's great. That's another two hours. Ugh. Thank you, officer. He's lying. He's lying. You need to see what's over that rise so you'll believe me. What, you just-- you want me to go through the roadblock? Yes, yes, please, please. Honestly, do you really think that we would do that? Come on! Well, then don't believe me! I don't care. I really don't care. Do whatever you want with me. Just please find my girlfriend or I think they're gonna kill her. Let me ask you something. Do you even have a girlfriend? Does this-- does this girl Leila even exist? Huh? We were gonna get married. There's no other way around it. Route 18 it is. Sir. Agent Lee! You need to see this. Plane's empty. Everyone made it out. So whatever went down happened after. We checked the vitals on all of 'em. Dead, sir. Every last one of 'em. == sync, corrected by elderman == == for www.addic7ed.com ==
