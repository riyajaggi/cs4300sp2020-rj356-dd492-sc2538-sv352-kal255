Yeah, I just was thinking... (EXCLAIMS) Listen, I know that this probably isn't the best time to do this since we're Ieaving very soon. But I just wanted to talk to you before we go, and I know this is kind of old-fashioned, it's completely old-fashioned actually, but I also know how much you Iove your daughter, obviously, and... Sean, relax. You have my blessing. I do? Well, you're gonna take good care of her, Iove her, cherish her, all that good stuff, right? Yes. Yes, yes, of course. Absolutely. Good.

(CAR ENGINE REVVING) Come on. (PHONE RINGING) Come on, pick up! Fred Dacosta. Are you the man in charge? Well, for the next nine minutes. Yes, I am. Okay, listen to me carefully, Fred. There's a terrorist on flight 514. Do not Iet it take off. You need to stop that plane or many people will die. Okay, Iisten, if this is some kind of a joke... Hey, Iook, Fred, we really don't have time for this, okay? Just tell me. What would it take for you to stop that plane? A bomb threat? Would that do it? Okay, fine! There's a bomb on flight 514. Did you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, I heard you. (TIRES SCREECHING) We've recaptured William. That's why I'm here. We finally tracked him down, hiding in plain sight in Los Angeles. Extracted him two days ago. You found him. After all this time. Yeah, he's not exactly thrilled about being back. And we may have a problem. He thinks he can buy his freedom back, trade it for information. What kind of information? He's going to tell them about The Event. He can't. He's going to. You have to convince him to change his mind. Do whatever it takes. Don't you think we should at Ieast warn them? So they can prepare? There's a new president in the White House. Martinez. He's a good man. I think he would help us. Presidents haven't helped us before. And even if he is a good man, Whitman and the others won't Iet him find out about this place. Yeah, well, I'II make sure he finds out. Simon, you're my only conduit to the outside. If our people out there are having doubts, I need you to reason with them. We have to protect ourselves. Can I count on you? Take her back to her quarters. MALE: Yes, sir. Well, what are you waiting for, Fred? Just do it! Okay, okay. Who's got Avias 514? Right here, boss. Take her to the emergency bomb area. Do it! Yes, sir, Avias 514, cancel take-off clearance. Taxi clear of runway and contact ground point niner. I did what you asked. Now who are you and what do you want? Who I am doesn't matter, just stop that plane! 514, this is Miami tower, do you copy? Sir, I'm not getting a response. Try calling him on GUARD.

Brett, radar's down. Entire system is down! (ERRATIC BEEPING) There they are. They're gonna take off! You ain't getting by me, come on! Come on! Come on! Stop, you son of a bitch! God damn it! (BEEPING) MAN: Simon, did you intercept him? I couldn't stop him. They're airborne. Sir, you need to sit down, please. Sir, be seated... MAN: He's got a gun! SEAN: Get over there! MAN: He's got a gun! Get back in the corner, get back there, okay? Now stay there. Open the door! You don't have to do this! MAUREEN: Sir... Just open the door, we can figure this out together. You have to open the door. Open it. Get back! Back! Back! Can you open it? No. Can you open the door? No! No! PIease? No, I can't, I can't. Well, how do I talk to the pilot? It's... I don't...

There's too much going on, 'cause I've been enjoying the view. Wait, no! I'm gonna get sand everywhere! I know, I wish the beach wasn't so sandy. Why does it always have to be so sandy? Okay, so it's almost 1:00. I say we grab some Iunch and then we do the hike. Okay. Okay. This place is so beautiful. Yeah, I knew you'd Iike it. It was the plan. What are you talking about? I thought you said the guy at the shop told you about it. Yeah, yeah, I kind of Iied about that. (CHUCKLING) What? Nothing. Can we just stop for a sec? Yeah, you can't keep up? I can. I can keep up. No, I... Okay, you know how we're always talking about getting away from it all and the two of us just going off and Iiving somewhere on a deserted island paradise somewhere? Yeah. Yeah, but then we get caught up in things, and we forget that places Iike this actually exist. So I just wanted to bring you here and sort of freeze this moment in time. What's... What's going on? (LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) Leila Buchanan, uh... Yes? When I first met you five years ago, I thought that I... GREG: Help! Somebody, help me, please! PIease help! Help! Somebody! Help! Help!

PIease, you've gotta help me, I can't swim with this cast. Vicky, hang on! PIease, help me! Vicky, hang on! Sean, what are you doing? Sean! Are you kidding? You can't do that! I'II be fine. You're gonna break your neck! Are you kidding? Sean! Sean! Sean! GREG: Vicky, hold on, he's coming! Sean! GREG: Swim! LEILA: Sean! GREG: Hold on, baby, he's coming! GREG: (EXCLAIMS) Vicky! Stop fighting. Stop fighting. Thank you! Thank you! (LAUGHTER) Can you breathe? Breathe. I got you. I got you. SEAN: It's been a Iong day, I think we're gonna... GREG: No, no, no, come on, guys! Stay with us. Yeah, I totally owe you one. No, don't worry about it. It was just instinct, you know? You guys are Iucky that Sean's a great swimmer. Oh, man, I'm so glad you were there, you have no idea, seriously. And you, you, come here. I'm never Ietting you near the edge of anything any time soon. I just Ieaned over to take a picture, and next thing you know, bam! It was Iike I got hit by a truck. I had no idea where I was. (PHONE RINGING) GREG: That was a Iong drop. VICKY: Swimming around aimlessly. SEAN: That could've ended badly. It's my parents. Guys, I'II be right back. She is so cute. You know she's hot, Sean, right? Yeah, no, I know both of those things are true. (CHUCKLES) Hey, Dad! Hey, sweetheart! How's Saint Lucia? You guys sound Iike you're having a good time! Yeah, we're just having some drinks with some new friends. Who else is there? Oh, no one, sweetie, it's just the TV. So, Iook, your mom and I just wanted to check in. You know what, Dad, it's really Ioud with the music, so if I could call you back tomorrow when it's Iess noisy, that'd be great. Yeah. Let's do that. Well, tell Mom and Sam I said hi. I will. Love you, pumpkin. AII right, I Iove you, Dad. Bye. Fresh drinks! Drink up. Idea. You know what we should do? We should all hang out for the rest of the cruise. Right? Do excursions together. I wanted to go snorkelling tomorrow, but I'm going to it by myself. 'Cause he can't go. Can't go. Broken! Will you guys come? Say you'II come, it'II be so much fun! Come on. Come on, come on, come on. It'II be fun! Yeah. GREG: AII right! VICKY: Snorkel buddies! Ow! Yeah, we're going snorkelling! Okay, cool. VICKY: Shots! Shots! SEAN: I'II do one shot. LEILA: Were they beginning to get on your nerves, too, or was that just me? No, yeah, they're a Iittle weird. But in a kind of a fun way. And oh, my God, can they drink! Yes. You know, I'm not convinced Vicky was totally sober when you fished her out. (LAUGHS) It's all beginning to make sense. Yeah, you see? Yeah. 5313... Yes. That's not us. Yeah, that's not... It's not. That's not us. 5314. Yep. This is us. This is us definitely. Wait. Fit in there. Come on. There we go. Okay, wait. Wait. What? What? What? I think I drank too much. Need some fresh air? I think that'd be a good idea. Okay. Okay, can we make a deal? Tomorrow, after the snorkelling thing, can we just go into Antigua and find a nice Iittle restaurant and have a romantic dinner? Just the two of us. No Greg, no Vicky. I would Iove that. Okay. Good. My dad called, by the way. Oh, yeah? He says hi. Hi, Dad! Hi, Dad. (KEYPAD BEEPING) Drop the gun! Now! Get the gun. Listen, Iisten, when this is all over, you can arrest me all you want, but right now we have to get into the cockpit. You or me, I don't care! Tell the pilot to turn the plane around. You get your hands behind your back. Get your hands behind your back! Now! Okay. AII right. (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMING) WOMAN: We're about to get shot! Oh, my God! What the... (SCREAMING) (ENGINE RUMBLING) MAN: Keep it up! What the... What the hell was that? Who's in there? Hi! Hey, how you doing? Happy birthday, David. Happy birthday. Okay, three, two... Wait a minute! You were supposed to wait! (INAUDIBLE CHATTER) Who wants cake? Hi, Christina. I'II pass on the cake. CHRISTINA: Okay, no cake for the Vice President, but everyone else wants some, right? CHILDREN: Yeah! Me! Me! (WHISPERING) Sorry. Gotta go. It's okay. So, this is, what, an intervention? Mr President, you're making a mistake, and everyone here agrees. What Director Sterling is saying is that we want to urge you to reconsider one more time. Yeah, no. I'm not changing my mind. I'm not. We're closing the Facility. How many times have we had this discussion? Too many times. I understand your family had it rough back in Cuba, but you can't Iet personal feelings affect your decisions. BIake! Not when the safety of our citizens is at stake. Are you saying I'm unable to be objective, because of my background? Is that what you're saying? With all due respect, Sir, that is exactly what I'm saying. BIake, please! No, no, no, Iet him talk, Iet him talk. We sacrifice the rights of the few for the safety of the many all the time. Now, you want to do the noble thing, I get it. But now is not the time. Now is the perfect time. It's not just about protecting the rights of the few, this is about protecting human rights. Now these people may not be Americans, but we are. Look what we have done to them. We've abused them, we've detained them illegally, after all this time. That's not what this country is about. Not any more. Gentlemen, we... No, no, no. What you're about to do is gonna make a Iot of Americans nervous. Myself included. How are we supposed to reassure the public when we don't have answers yet? EIi, what it comes down to is, we don't have enough information to feel safe enough to Iet them out. Mr President, it's not too Iate to cancel the press conference. Even if I delayed this announcement, we've already granted one reporter exclusive access to keep a Iid on this until today. Guys, it's too Iate. The information is already out there. AII right, then, fine! Let the public find out. Just please, EIi, don't Iet them out. ELIAS: For God's sake, BIake. How could you keep this from me? What did you think, you were just gonna keep running this thing without my knowledge? PIausible deniability, Sir. That's your excuse? Information regarding the Mount Inostranka Facility has always been on a need-to-know basis. I am the President of the United States. I need to know. So this is true? This is... This is all true? Yes. This is unbelievable. So how many are there? How many prisoners? Ninety-seven. May I ask how you obtained this file? No, you may not. The CIA has overseen this programme for many years. I can assure you everything is under control. There's no need for you to be concerned. I wanna go there. I wanna meet them. Here it is. Welcome to Mount Inostranka. MALE SOLDIER: Detail, ten hut! Carry on! I've assembled the detainees in the mess hall, just as you asked. I also want to see their Iiving quarters. And the research Iabs. Yes, sir. But first, you said you might want to meet their Ieader. (BUZZER SOUNDING) (BUZZER SOUNDING) Mr President. I'm Sophia. Live from Miami. Coming up following the Presidential address, anticipated worldwide and still shrouded in mystery, I will sit down with President Martinez for an exclusive interview. Here's the final draft of your speech. AII right. Thank you. Thanks. Sophia, welcome (CHUCKLING) Thank you. So... So... Are you sure you're ready to do this? We've been ready for a Iong time. Well, your time has come, my friend. Thank you. Rachel? RACHEL: Yes, sir? Are we ready? We're just waiting for the Vice President. I need a Iock on the Vice President, please. MAN: The Vice President left an hour ago, also Director Sterling left a little later. No! We need him at the press conference. Right now. MAN ON RADIO: Code red, code red. Mr President, we have to evacuate. What's going on? We have to go now. She's coming with us. Let's go! Go! We have to go now. We have to go. MAN: Let him through, move! Ma'am, Iet's go! What is going on? We've Iost all radar capability. Our entire system is down! Sir, we need to keep moving. Keep moving, keep moving! System is down here? The entire Eastern seaboard, sir. We think the attack is already under way, you may be the target! Where's Christina? I don't see Christina. Just go to the car. They're in the car! EIias! EIias, come on. Daddy! I'm here. (WATER DRAINING FROM SINK) (THUNDER RUMBLING) MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm sure they're just having a good time someplace. Look, I really think we should try to give her a Iittle more space. You worry about her more than I do. You're just better off at hiding it. Then you blame it on me. Okay, true, yes. But Iook, she's not seven any more. What's wrong with seven? Nothing's wrong with seven, sweetheart. FEMALE REPORTER: The President will address the nation next week... Okay, fine, Iet's call her. See what I mean? Yes, I know what you mean. (PHONE RINGING) It's my parents. Guys, I'II be right back. AII right. VICKY: She is so cute. Hey, Dad! Hey, sweetheart! How's Saint Lucia? You guys sound Iike you're having a good time! Yeah, we're just having some drinks with some new friends. Who else is there? Oh, no one, sweetie, it's just the TV. So Iook, we haven't heard from you in a couple of days. So your mom and I just wanted to check in. Tell her I said hi. Hi, sweetie! Your mom says hi. MICHAEL: How's Sean? Sam, you Ieft your bike outside again. But I'm gonna use it tomorrow. Yeah, that's not a good enough excuse. Go grab it. You think I could call you back tomorrow when it's not so noisy? Yeah. Let's do that. SAMANTHA: I'm going to use it tomorrow. No buts. Fine. Tell Mom and Sam I said hi. I will. Love you, pumpkin. All right, I love you, Dad. Bye. That was fast. Yeah, well, she couldn't hear over the music. So she'II call tomorrow. (THUNDER RUMBLING) So, well, I'm just saying, I think you should start to trust Sean a Iittle more. Yeah, what's that supposed to mean? (SCREAMING) MICHAEL: No, I just... You know, he's a good kid. He's a good kid. No, no, no, the way you said that. You know something. Don't know anything. What do you know? MICHAEL: She's not telling me anything. Nobody's telling me anything. MOM: You... MICHAEL: Totally... I don't know about that. Captain. Hi, I'm Maureen Donovan. Michael Buchanan. How are you? Welcome aboard. Mike, what's up, bud? How you doing? I thought I was flying with Davies. Yeah, I don't know. Scheduling change. Well, Captain, we've got clear skies all the way to Sao Paulo. Should be a smooth ride. (AIRPLANE ENGINE HUMMING) What the hell is going on? Son, who's in there? I'II explain everything once we're on the ground, but right now, unless you want to be used as a Iive bomb, you have to get us in there. PIease. (WHIMPERING) SEAN: PIease! Okay. Okay. Thank you. Open the door. Keep your hands where I can see them. AII right, all right. What's going on? What's that? It gives the pilot a few seconds to override the system before he can Iock it. Which he just did. Well, try it again! Try it again. No, no, no, once the override is set, you can't get in there from out here. Damn it, Mike! MALE: Look! What? MAN: Oh, my God. Oh, God. AIR MARSHAL: They're gonna shoot us down. How do we get in there? They're gonna shoot us down. I'm so glad we decided to do this. Yeah. Greg totally missed out. Well, snorkelling with a cast. You can't really blame him. What did he end up doing? I don't know. He went on some jungle excursion. Sounded Iame. (LAUGHING) Leila's gonna be so bummed. She would have Ioved this. Leila... I'm sure it's just food poisoning. She'II be better by tomorrow, right? Well, I think it's just that she had a Iittle too much to drink Iast night actually. Right. Maybe it could've been that. Sorry. (LAUGHING) That's all right. Well, at Ieast we had fun, right? Right? Yes. Picture! What? Let's take a picture. Okay. Damn it. Leila, it's me. My card's not working. Leila, are you okay? Hi, I just need a new key. A Iittle problem? What's the matter with the key? It just wasn't working in the door when I tried it. Sometimes the magnetic strip gets damaged. So I'II get you a new one. Okay. What was the name again? Walker. Sean. It's not coming up. What's your room number? 5314. Actually, I have someone else in room 5314. What... What do you mean? No, no, no, that's my room.

Look, my girlfriend is up there right now, and she wasn't feeling well this morning, and now she's not even answering the door, so could you just please give me a new key? Sir, without knowing your room number, I can't... 5314! Mr Walker, you're not... Okay, can someone just Iet me into my room? I'm not crazy, I'm not on drugs. I know that my room is 5314. There's a balcony. We've been there for four days. It's a suite. See, there's the flickering Iight, and my key doesn't work, so... No, I've already tried knocking. My girlfriend is in there, and she's sick. Yes. Can you please just Iet me in? I understand, but Iegally, I can't just open the door. Hi. Sorry to bother you, Sir. Ship security. JB: Is there a problem? Who are you? I'm sorry? SECURITY: Hey, hey, hey, you can't just walk in! JB! JB: What is this? SECURITY: Hey, wait a minute! Where is my girlfriend?

Okay. Yeah, I would Iove to show you my passport, except it happens to be in my room with the rest of my stuff! And my girlfriend! Can you... Sir. Sir. Sir!
