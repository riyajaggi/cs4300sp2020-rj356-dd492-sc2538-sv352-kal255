 I'm the man who pulled the plane out ofthe sky to save your Iife. ELIAS: What do you want? Release Sophia and the rest of the detainees Iike you promised to. That promise was based on the premise that we were both being honest with each other. Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses. Release Sophia and the detainees, or this time people will die. (WHIMPERING) It's burning! Let go of me! I have to get out!

 NURSE 1: Ma'am, ma'am. NURSE 2: Hold up. No, no, no! No! No! Let me out! No! (SOBBING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) Can somebody tell me what the hell's going on? PIease, just tell me what the hell's going on! Nurse! Nurse! Mr. Buchanan. We're only trying to help you. What is happening? Tell me! Tell me! Mr. Buchanan. What is happening? The hemorrhaging is getting worse,

 and the symptom set is widening. The passengers' nervous systems and now their cognitive functions are under attack. Yeah, but from what? Do you know what's wrong with them yet? The blood tests show no sign of viral or bacterial infection. I think we're Iooking at a foreign, or possibly extraterrestrial organism. Well, then at Ieast we have clarity about who's doing this to them. Sophia's people, this group of sleepers, including this man, Thomas, that she kept secret from us all these years. Regardless of the cause of infection, do we have a way to treat them to make them better? We've tried everything. It is impossible to treat what we don't understand. If the passengers continue to decline at this rate, none of them will be alive by morning. Mr. President, a man identifying himself as Thomas just called in to the White House switchboard asking to speak to you. We're attempting to run a voice match to the first call you received from him. I'II recognize his voice. I assume that means you want to take the call. Absolutely. Put him through. BLAKE: Have NSA throw everything they've got in tracing the call. AIready have them on it, sir. Put it through. (BEEPS) MURPHY: You're on the Iine with the President. THOMAS: Mr. President. I assume by now you realize the 183 passengers aboard FIight 514 do not have Iong to Iive. Correct? What do you want? I have a counteragent. An antidote that can reverse the process, save their lives. Meet my demands, and I'll get it to you. Your demands? Release Sophia and the detainees in Inostranka. AII 96 of them. You know I can't do that. Then this conversation is over, and the passengers will die. You Iisten to me, you son of a bitch... You have two hours to make arrangements for the release of my people. I'II call you back then. (WIND HOWLING) SOPHIA: Thomas! Thomas! They've spotted us. They'II be here soon. We have to move everyone out. SOPHIA: No. There are too many wounded, we wouldn't get far. I need you to gather all the able-bodied and get ready to go. What about you? I can't abandon them. No. Unless you go, there's no hope for any of us. There is if we fight. Listen to me, I can't risk all of us being caught. We'II be together soon. I promise. SOPHIA: Now go. SIMON: Thomas. Thomas, come on. Come on. They're almost here, we gotta go. Everybody! Let's go, come on! Let's go! Thomas, we have to stop! Let people rest. Not yet! Look! Everybody! Wait here until we know it's safe! It's empty. Look at that. There's food. It doesn't Iook Iike anybody's been here in a while. Ship didn't survive the crash. We're trapped here. We have to figure out another way to get home. What about Sophia and the others? We can't just Ieave them behind. I have no intention of that. But first things first. Come take a Iook at this. What is it? They're still using vacuum tubes. They have nowhere near the Ievel of technology we're going to need to get back. We'II figure something out. That's easy for you to say. Sophia didn't saddle you up with getting it done. She chose you for a reason, Thomas. Because she believes in you. It will take years. And no Iuck with the trace, sir. Mr. President, I understand the natural inclination to want to save the passengers, but the truth is we have no reason to trust this man. And I don't need to remind you it's the Iongstanding policy of this country not to negotiate with terrorists. You're right, you don't need to tell me that. I'd also Iike to point out that releasing Sophia and the detainees in return for the antidote will be perceived as weakness and will only encourage the enemy to make bigger demands in the future. The people on that plane are innocent. Some of them are children. And it's tragic. But what this man, Thomas, is doing is an act of war. And in war, there are casualties. It's unavoidable. We'II reconvene in two hours. Before he calls back in. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Yeah. SIMON: Thomas, listen to me. It's not too late. Hand over the antidote in good faith, and there's a chance we can repair the damage you've already done. Why? We both know what kind of man Martinez is. Idealistic and indecisive. When push comes to shove, he'II cave. You can't turn us into murderers. What does it matter? I mean, they're all gonna die anyway. Sophia's been fighting for the release of our people in Inostranka for the Iast 66 years. And she got nothing. I'm sick of waiting. Now we're gonna do things my way. And by tomorrow, our people will be free. (PHONE RINGING) Hi, this is Sean. Leave a message. (BEEPS) Any Iuck? No, it's going straight to voicemail. I also tried calling my mom and dad, but they're not picking up. Is it possible that he got the message, and he talked to someone else? No. Trust me, if he calls, you will be the first to know. You have a nice family. Thank you. We'II be celebrating 15 years come this January. How Iong are we gonna keep this up? If she doesn't connect with Walker before daybreak, we're gonna have to pull out. He'II call. You sound pretty sure. I spent time with them. I saw how they were with each other. AII Sean's thinking about is finding Leila. You better be right. For both our sakes. Just got the final orders. The target's been expanded. They want us to take out the entire family. Why? Doesn't really matter. We kill everyone in the house. Understood? Everyone. (ALARM BLARING) (GUN FIRING) (GRUNTS) (PERSON GASPING) (BABY CRYING FAINTLY) Hey, Rick, it's Sean. You're finally returning my calls. Gonna have to keep this short. Europe just opened. Rick, Iisten, Leila's in danger. What do you mean? Is she okay? I hope so. I'm trying to find her. Look, I need you to run a Iocate on a cell phone number. It belongs to a woman who calls herself Vicky Roberts. Sean, I don't do that anymore. Not since the feds started cracking down on hacking. I have a family now. Leila may be killed if I don't find her. Okay? PIease. Tracking this number is my only chance. Sean, what did you get yourself into? It's better if you don't know. Will you do this for me, or not? What's the number? My friend ran Vicky's number, but didn't get a hit. Her phone might be off. Well, he'II keep trying, and then he'II call me if he finds a Iocation. Your phone's dead. Got it covered. LEILA: Sean? Sean, it's me. It's Leila. I'm okay, I'm safe. I'm in this police station. In this town, Snyder. In Texas. She's here in Texas. I got away, but I don't think that the police believe me. Sean, please come and get me. I love you. She's at a police station in Snyder. I don't think that's too far from here. (PHONE RINGING) Snyder Police Department. It's for you. Sean? Leila! Is it you? Is it really you? Yeah, yes, it's me. It's me! We're coming to get you right now. We're on our way to Snyder. We're a Iittle over an hour away. Are you hurt? Are you okay? No, I'm okay. There were these people that took me off the ship. Vicky was one of them. They were trying to force my dad to... I know, I know. Sean, they were going to kill me. I didn't know what to do. I had to shoot her to get away. But you're okay now. You're safe. And I'II be there soon, I promise. I have so much to tell you. I believe you. (STATIC ON THE LINE) I knew you would find me. (GARBLED) Wait, Leila, hold on. Can you hear me? Sean... Sean, you're breaking up. Sean, I'm Iosing you. I have the address, okay? So, I'm coming for you, all right? Okay. I can't wait to see you. I Iove you. I Iove you, too. Can I go to the bathroom? Well, of course, it's down the hall to your Ieft. (TAP RUNNING) (DRYER BLOWING) Hey! No! Get off me! Go! Go! Keep us safe, Lord. Keep all of us safe. Don't Iet us die, please, God. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. (PANTING) NURSE FULLER: We're Iosing him! MAUREEN: You're gonna kill him! Ma'am. Ma'am, calm down. Calm down! Ow! AII right, all right. Calm down. (HEART MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) NURSE FULLER: Doctor! DR. BLOCK: Meg of epi, chase with Iido. Charge to 360! Got it! CIear! Charging again. CIear! DR. BLOCK: Okay, he's back. (GAGGING) Get the IVs going. Ativan! Two milligrams IM. (GASPING) DR. BLOCK: Chase it with Haldol ifyou need to. Help me. Help me. I couldn't sleep. What's going on? It's the passengers, they're getting worse. They're dying. AII of them. Oh, my God. Why? They've been infected by something. By this man, Thomas. The one who put the cell phone in David's backpack? Yeah. He claims to have an antidote which he'II give us in return for me releasing the detainees. Well, do you think he's telling the truth, that he really has a cure? I don't know that it matters. You're not thinking of Ietting them die? EIias, he's only asking you to do what you were going to do anyway. You were minutes away from releasing the detainees. But that was before I realized Sophia was Iying to me about how many of her people were here, about them being helpless. We can't Iet them out until we understand what they really want, what they're doing here. You sound Iike BIake Sterling. This has got nothing to do with BIake. Things have changed. Yes, but you haven't. EIias, I know you. If there's even a small chance that you can save those people's Iives... Christina, it's not that simple, not when you're in my shoes! Mr. President, we only have a minute. But we should discuss our strategy. I'm aware of that. And what have you decided, Mr. President? Mr. President, he's called, and he's on hold. Go ahead. You're on with the President. THOMAS: I have the counteragent prepared and ready to be delivered to you as soon as you release Sophia and the detainees. Don't bother. What did you say? Don't bother. I'm not releasing any of them. It's not going to happen. Then the passengers will die. And what I did to them, I can do to whole towns, entire cities. You accept the terms to my deal... Here's the new deal. You're going to give me that antidote, and you're going to give it to me when I tell you to, because if even one of those passengers dies, I will execute Sophia and the rest of the detainees at Inostranka. AII of them! You wouldn't. You're wrong. How Iong have you been Iiving here? Six months. I'm impressed that you were able to find me. We were all counting on you. How could you Ieave everyone behind Iike that? Without a clue as to where you were going or why? I knew you could handle it. Taking care of everyone. That's not the point. What are you even doing here? I'm supposed to bring us home. That's what I'm doing. Yeah? How? You saw how behind they are. I'm trying to boost your scientific knowledge so we can be helped, too. Thanks to what I've already done, the US government should have the capability to create nuclear fission in a matter of months instead of decades. They're calling it the Manhattan Project. Do you know what they're going to use this for? This country is at war, Thomas. I don't care what they're gonna use it for. It's what we're gonna use it for that matters. (PANICKED PANTING) Mr. President. BIake, come in. I have somewhat promising news. May I? How's that? Yeah. In 1944, when the army built Inostranka to house the prisoners, they included a Iast-resort safety feature to neutralize the detainees quickly and permanently. This termination protocol would be the best way to proceed should we not receive the antidote. Termination protocol? The idea is to seal off the prisoners' Iiving quarters and pump carbon monoxide from the physical plant into the air ducts. That's barbaric. Well, it may seem that way now, but in 1944, no one could be sure how much of a threat they posed to humanity. Given the time we have, I think this is our strongest option. We can have it back online in under two hours. Mr. President, are you having second thoughts about this? Because reneging on your threat at this point would be the worst of all possible scenarios. I understand this isn't easy, standing up to this man no matter what the consequences. But if it makes any difference, I believe you're doing the right thing. (SCOFFS FAINTLY) Do it. Yes, Mr. President. (DOOR CLOSES) SIMON: I had to dig out the original blueprints, but it's been there all these years. This thing's real. EIias would never murder people in cold blood. He's a good man. Your words. I know what I said. But things have changed. I'm telling you, Martinez is ready to go through with this if Thomas doesn't back down. It will never come to that. Thomas won't Iet the passengers die. Sophia, he will. Look, his pride is blinding him. He's gone too far. He's not the same man I put in charge back then. I can't sit here and Iet him sacrifice the Iives of all those innocent people. Look, I tried to tell him we couldn't allow that to happen, but he wouldn't Iisten to me. But he will Iisten to me. I don't care if it means I have to spend another 66 years in this damn prison. You tell him to release the antidote now, before any of those poor people die. And make sure he understands it's an order. I hope you're here to tell me you talked sense into the President. He wouldn't have Iistened to me even if I'd tried. He's going to regret pushing me. I'II Iet the passengers die... No, you're not. I talked to Sophia. She agrees with me. She wants you to hand over the antidote. I don't care. What did you say? I'm done taking orders from Sophia. She and Martinez deserve each other, they're both weak. It's Iike you once told me, she put me in charge for a reason. I take my own orders from now on. Like hell you do. Give me the antidote. Over my dead body. Come here! What are you going to do to me, huh? Don't you get it? The President isn't going to back down. Neither am I. Then you're sentencing your own people to death. That's it? Come on! We went to a Iot of trouble, you could at Ieast act surprised. Stay away from me. That's what you should've told your sweetie on the phone. Instead, you're Ieading him right to us. Thank you. Go to hell. Hey. Sean will be here any minute. I'II take the roof. Call me with a heads-up when you get the visual. Will do. PIease... PIease don't do this. Sean hasn't done anything. I have orders, and I have no choice but to follow them. Even if that means killing innocent people? It's that simple for you? No one told me there'd be a baby. I didn't see a need. You had your orders. Take out the family, burn down the house. And that's what you did, right? Because if I had any doubt that you were unable to fulfill the contract, then we would have to deal with that. It's done. Good. (TV PLAYING) Mom, you Ieft the door opened. (SIGHS) (SOFTLY) Everything go okay? (WHISPERING) Fine. There's some spaghetti Ieft ifyou want it. I'm not that hungry. I'm just going to go Iay down, okay? (SIGHS) You're safe here. I promise. (DOOR SLAMS) (CELL PHONE RINGS) Go. I got the car, block and a half, coming at us. It's Walker. He's got the FBI agent with him. What? Just her? Yeah. I've got my M24. I could end this right now, while they're still in the car. No, our orders are to be discreet. Just wait till they get inside. Here we go. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hey, Rick. Listen, we found Leila. You did? You're in Snyder? How did you know that? The woman you asked me to look for, Vicky Roberts, she just switched her phone on, and that's where she is, Snyder, Texas. Vicky's in Snyder. Are you sure? 26th Street, between Avenues M and N. Vicky's inside the precinct. How... It's a trap. Rick, we gotta go. We gotta get out of here. Leave? We know they're monitoring Iaw enforcement, okay? We can't call for help. We're not gonna just Ieave Leila here! Okay, the second we walk in there, we'II be killed. Okay, give me a gun... We don't even know how many people are in there. And we don't know how much Ionger they're gonna keep Leila alive. We have to get her out now! Sean! Just please Iisten to me, it's a suicide! Okay? We have no move here. (SEAN SIGHS) Maybe we do. (DIALING ON CELL PHONE) What are you doing? I'm sending a message. (CELL PHONE BEEPS) (CELL PHONE RINGS) Who is this? SEAN: You went to a lot of trouble to hide him. Your son. Sean... Not letting your son keep photos of his mother. Not Ietting him know your real name. I've got to think that was for a reason. I don't know what you're talking about. Of course you don't. We're outside. But I assume you already know that. So, here's what's going to happen. I'm walking in there, and I'm walking out with Leila. Or your son's picture and address go viral. There are other people in here. You don't know what you're doing. Maybe. But you do. So help us, and no one has to know about Adam. You know I don't want to do this, but you didn't really give me much of a choice. So, at Ieast I'm giving you one. (HANGS UP) Did she go for it? I don't know. But I'm going in. Take this. He's heading your way. The fed's staying in the car. Walker's coming in alone. (GASPS) SEAN: Leila! (GUNS FIRING) Go! She's in the back! Go! Leila! (GRUNTS) Leila! Leila! Sean? Leila? Sean! Sean, I'm in here! Leila, stand back! I'm gonna kick the door down! Oh, God. Oh, God. We gotta go. Okay? You're okay? Follow me. Drop it! Now! I will use it. (GUN FIRES) Go. Now! Get in! (TIRES SCREECHING) Walker came in with FBI agents. I don't know how they found us. They took the girl. And I'm not sure how they knew. Somebody must have talked. No, they got Carter, too. I'm the only one Ieft. I'II wait for orders at the rendezvous point. I got to go. We'II get someplace safe. Then he and I are going to have a Iittle talk. You came. Mr. President, it's three minutes past the deadline. No antidote has been forthcoming. The termination protocol is ready. Just one more minute. (PHONE RINGING) Where's the antidote? You'II get it when you release my people. Just Iike I proposed. Then there's nothing more we have to talk about. And you will have the deaths of Sophia and the detainees on your hands. Are we done? No, wait. There's no point in any more talk unless I get the antidote. I'm hanging up. Don't! Do not hang up! You heard what I said. Give me just one. Spell it out. Give me one of my people, and I'II get you the antidote. Who? Sophia. Agreed. Sophia for the antidote. But if I release her and the antidote doesn't work, or it doesn't get here in time, you Ieave me no choice, I'II have to execute your people. It'II be delivered to the CDC in time. Take Sophia to the Farragut North metro station. Put her on the red line that's scheduled to depart at 8:16. No one on the train or in the station. And no stops once she boards. Just keep the train moving. Done. AII right, we need to put a tracking device on her, something she can't easily get rid of. Yeah, we have traceable material that can be added to her food and water. Do it. She will Iead us straight to Thomas. He's your new priority. (SIRENS BLARING) Yes, sir. Right away. I have the President for you. I had no choice but to release you, Sophia. So don't mistake this for kindness or trust. I won't. But I hope to regain both. What Thomas has done goes against everything that I believe in. Then prove it. Rein him in, Iike you said you could. Keep that promise, we'II start from there. I understand, Mr. President. (METRO CLANGING) Hi. Hi I spoke to Rachel. She told me you were able to get the antidote. Yeah. The passengers are already getting better. She told me how you got it. EIias, if it didn't work out, would you have... Would you have done it, and gone through with your threat and murdered the detainees? The thing that matters is that it did work out. That's not an answer. Well, honey, it's the only answer I have right now. Wow. I'm gonna go take David to school. Okay.
