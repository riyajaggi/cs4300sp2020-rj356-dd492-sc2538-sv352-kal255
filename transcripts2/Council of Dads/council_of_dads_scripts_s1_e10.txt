 Previously on "Council of Dads"... I wrote this blog, and the "Savannah Gazette" reprinted it. I wrote about Anthony, that he was my bio-dad. I have a disease called GSS. It debilitates you until it kills you. Your family's life is better with Larry in it, but mine and Ivy's... It's better without him. Oliver, I think I'm in labor. Tropical Storm Aiden has changed course, now heading directly for the Georgia coast.

 When I went to grab the flashlight, I brought Cowboy with me. He's stuck down there? I'll go get him. - Theo! - Mom! My ankle... it's stuck. I think it's broken. All right, let's get you to a hospital. - What the hell? - Oh, my God! - Are you okay? - Who's that? Need a ride? Anthony? Robin, the causeway bridge is already underwater! - You alone? - No, Theo's with me! He broke his ankle! Help me get him out of the car! - Let's get you out of here. - Don't touch me!

 - Theo, come on. - Theo, Theo! I can do it myself! We don't need rescuing! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on, come on, come on, come on... hey. Stop it. Theo, you know we have to get out of here, okay? So, please, put your feelings about him aside and let him help us. Let him help us. You're okay. I got you. Just stay here. I'm gonna get Cowboy, okay? We got to go. That was for my dad! Come on, come on. It's almost been a year since Scott died, and we're all still standing... Bruised and beaten, sure... You okay? - But somehow, we survived. - Yeah. I guess I had that coming. Meet... - Our son. - What? Oh, Ollie. - He's perfect. - Yes, he is. Aw, hey. But, uh, there's something I need to tell you. - Hey. - Hey. - Who are you? - Uh, I'm Evan. Hi, Evan. - Dang. - Luly, Evan's home. - Um, you are? - Sorry. Denise. - My mom, she lives next door. - Hey. Yours was the only house with power last night, so we had a hurricane party. Oh, uh, great. Ever since my dad died, I've been nervous with my mom living here alone but, it's nice to know she has neighbors looking out. Evan, oh, my God. It's so good to see you. You okay? Is your mom okay? - Yeah, yeah. We're all good. - Okay, good. - Just so happy you're okay. - Yeah. We're okay because of you. The house, the generator. I know. God, I love you. - Uh, what's that? - Oh, this is a guinea pig. It's Larry's granddaughter's. Can I use your car to take them home? And I also still have to stop at Oliver's house to tell my mom about the article. Uh, yeah. Be careful, okay? There's a lot of tree branches and stuff in the roads. - I will. - All right. Come on, Eliza. You in pain? Ah, we gave him plenty of meds. He's not feeling anything. Hey, did you hear that I punched a guy? - Yeah, you told me. - I'd do it again, too. If you hurt my family, I will hurt you. How's he doing? See his face? I did that... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Anthony, would you please wait outside and I'll clean you up? I'm gonna... - He's asleep. - That's a blessing. Can you stay there? All right, this is gonna hurt. I probably deserve the pain. Let's not get all macho victim tough guy here. "Macho victim tough guy." Is that a thing? Well, it shouldn't be a thing, but you're making it one. Theo's definitely making it one, so, yeah, I guess it's a thing. - Ow. - I told you. So how'd you get here? Private plane from Vegas to Atlanta, then I drove to Savannah. Wow. I wasn't gonna sit in the desert and let my family drown. "Your family," huh? I'm not sure you get to come back into the fold quite so easily. - Rob? - Sam? "Rob"? That's friendly. Are you back with the cop? Hey, I was worried about you. Glad you're okay. Hey. Anthony Lavelle. Oh, right. Yeah, sure. Uh, Sam Baldwin. So, uh, yeah, an ER nurse... Asked me to come investigate a domestic incident. Apparently some kid punched a guy. - Is that Theo? - Uh... Yep, we're, um... Theo and Anthony are the domestic incident. Uh, so everything's fine. I-I had just... told Theo about Anthony, and he was processing the news. By punching him in the face? I mean, it wasn't an ideal reaction, but to be fair, he had just broken his ankle, and emotions were running very high. - Broke his ankle? - It was a hell of a night. I want to tell you all about it. I should get back, but first... - I'm so glad you're okay. - Oh, it was terrifying, Sam. There was Theo and Cowboy and Anthony and... and water in my house. Oh, my God. My house. Wait, is my house still standing? - Have you seen it? - I haven't seen it. But Tybee Island's gonna be closed awhile. - How long is a while? - I don't know. But I hope you packed extra underwear in your backpack. I got to go. Okay, go, go. Be safe. All right. Okay. He's so cute. What's his name? - We don't know yet. - Where's Tess? I left her at her birth mom's. Wanted to make sure everything was safe here first. Where's Mom and Theo? They'll be here any minute. And if not, I'll drive to Tybee myself. Cowboy! Oh, my goodness. - Hey. - Mom! JJ, Char. - You okay? - Yeah. - We were so worried. - There's my baby. Come here, you. Come here. Ollie... Is that a baby? - You had the baby? - You missed a party. - You delivered him? - Yeah, he was great. And he... they know about the GSS. How are you? Happy he's out, but, uh, I think we did good. - Right, Oliver? - You did great. He's so beautiful, you guys. Has anyone heard from Luly? Larry? No, but I'm sure they're fine. - What happened to your foot? - Oh. I broke my ankle on the stairs, and then Mom got me. I almost didn't make it out, but then Anthony showed up. - Anthony's here? - Yeah. And then I punched him in the face - because I found out... - Hey, hey, hey, hey. No. We know. - We read the article. - What article? This article. Someone from my writers' group sent it to the paper. Mom, I'm so sorry. I... We'll talk about it later. I'm just glad you're safe. We're all safe. Wait, there's a baby. You had the baby? - Oh, my God! - Yeah. - My God, he's an angel. - Come here. Yes, he is. This is my big man. - When did this happen? - Last night. - How'd you guys sleep? - JJ snores. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - Mom, do I snore? - Yeah, buddy, but it's cute. Mom, are you almost out? I need to take a shower. Yeah, you do. All right, all yours. - They reopened Tybee Island. - Tybee's open? - Wait, can we go home? - Oh, no. They just reopened part of it. Your neighborhood is still closed. - Theo! Mom! - Theo! It's Anthony. I bought it for you before I left, but your mom didn't feel right about it at the time. I believe my exact words were, "Over my dead body." She needs a car, Rob, and this is a car. I don't know. It feels loaded. It's a guilt gift. I'm not saying that this makes what I did right. You shouldn't have cheated with my dad's girlfriend. I know. And you should have really used birth control. - Dude. - He's right. He's eight. And he read an article about his dad's best friend cheating with his dad's girlfriend, and he had some questions. Look, Anthony, this is too weird. - I can't... - You need a car. It doesn't have to mean anything. It doesn't mean he's your dad... because you're not. It doesn't mean we forgive you because we don't. It's just a car. It is really sweet. See if you like it. It's up to you, Lu. Anybody want to ride around the block? - Shotgun. - Me, me. Oh, Evan, too slow. Back seat. I'm gonna go call Jules. - Oh. - Yeah. You going back to Vegas? I don't know. I'm just... one day at a time right now. Well, it's been almost a year since Scotty died, and we're all feeling pretty protective of him, so having you around right now... Look, I'm just sticking around to get the Crab Shack back on its feet. Larry's picking me up right now. We're gonna go look at the damage. - I hope it's okay. - It's survived worse. Oh, boy. - The deck is... - Gone. And the bar. You guys have been through hurricanes before. - Is this salvageable? - Let's see. The water came right up to here. The kitchen was basically in the ocean. It still kind of is. Larry, we need to rebuild. Well, there's a big insurance policy. Yeah, the Gladwell rep is coming out to get the claim started. Oh, freezer did its job. Let's salvage whatever food we can - and start feeding the people. - What food? What people are you talking about? The community, whoever needs it. We don't have power. We'll get charcoal and grills. What? We could stand around and feel sorry for ourselves, or we can go to work. Well, I was kind of hoping we could feel sorry for ourselves for, I don't know, like, an hour. Yeah, maybe we could make this a donation center, too, - for water, blankets, clothes. - That's a great idea. Just need to get the word out. Cool. Why don't we have Luly write a blog? She writes pretty impressive stuff. You saw her piece. Got picked up by the "Journal-Constitution," so all of Atlanta saw her piece. I probably should have told you. When we were dating and I was falling in love with you? Um, you could've said, like, "Hey, uh, I've got a lot going on, Margot." Or, "It's not you, honey. It's me." That is what you should've said. Should I give you two a minute? - No. - Yeah. Nope, done feeling sorry for myself. Moving on. So Sage is getting dressed. You did good, Ollie. Uh, all right, guys. So what are we calling little man? We can't decide. I mean, I like a million names. Peter keeps saying no. Nothing feels right yet. Well, we have to decide by tomorrow. We finalize the adoption. - Oh, we need a witness. - I wouldn't miss it. Also, Sage wants him tested for GSS. You guys can opt to get the results or not. - It's up to you. - What good is knowing? - Doesn't change anything. - We got to know. If we're gonna do this, we got to know what we're doing. "If we're gonna do this"? Peter? When I came back, you had already decided, so I got on board, but... Peter, you got to tell him how you feel. - This is too important. - He doesn't want to hear it. I don't want to hear you say "if we're doing this." - We're doing this. - I'm scared, okay? There's nothing to be scared of. There's gonna be a cure for this by the time he'd have any symptoms. And what if there is not? Uh, all right, so our young man needs to get his blood drawn. Peter, would you take him? I can take him. Actually, Ollie, I want to talk to you for a minute. Peter, would you take him? - What? - He's scared, Ollie. Yeah, I keep trying to reassure him. No, you keep dismissing his fears. You know what? I should get in there. That baby's gonna cry bloody murder. Hold on... When Scotty was dying, you know what he wanted to talk about? Dying. You know what I did not want to talk about? Him dying. And one day he got really mad. He said, "Robin, I'm dying. Please don't make me do it alone." But Peter's not alone. He has me. Right. Don't tell me. Tell him. Perfect. We've had so many volunteers and donations. Lu, thank you for reaching out to the paper. Yeah, they were super into it. I think they still feel bad for printing the blog without my permission. But I don't know if you've been reading the comments, but it seems to have struck a nerve. Yeah, I have. Also been getting a lot of texts from people asking if I'm okay. Are you? I mean, I feel a little bit like our personal business is out there for everyone to see, and that's not great, but, yeah, I'm okay. They want me to write a weekly column called "Dear Dad." Lu, no. So many people have reached out with their own "Dear Dad" or "Dear Mom" letters, and they want me to feature a different one every week. So you'd just be editing other people's stuff? Well, no. They still want me to write letters every once in a while. People want to know what's up next with the family and the dads. And I won't print anything that you have a problem with. I have a problem with the whole thing. I'm a writer, Mom, and this is what I want to write about... About grief, moving forward, and our family and the dads. And it helps people. Okay, ice cream's still good. So we have clam juice, ice cream... - Mm-hmm. - And some vegetables. We can make she-crab soup. I mean, we don't have crab. Anthony's grilling all of it. No, you just need a little. - But we don't have milk. - We have ice cream. Good idea. - Make it. - Me? I-I can't. I have... I have a broken ankle. Well, it's a good thing we cook with our hands. Gladwell guy's here. The cleanup is well under way. The Perry family really rallied the whole community. - That's impressive... - Yeah. Considering it isn't even their place anymore. It'll always be the Perrys' place. - How's Vegas? - I'm back here. I'm gonna get this place back up on its feet. And then what? You offer me a contract, and I'll see. I already offered you a contract. You left before it was up. Apparently contracts don't mean a lot to you. Cost us a bunch of money when you left. I'm sorry. I was dealing with some personal stuff. Mm-hmm. - Well, Margot... - Uh-huh. - Show me around. - Yeah. We need to get to the social worker's by 3:00. You want to meet here and drive over? Okay. Sage gave him three ounces an hour ago. We got to get at least another ounce in him before we put him down. This should be a happy day for us. Look, Ollie, I'm just stressed. I didn't sleep last night, and right now I feel like I'm the bad guy here. I'm gonna make some avocado toast for Sage. Do you want some? I don't listen to you. You say stuff, and if it isn't what I want to hear, I tune it out. You were saying all kind of stuff about our relationship before you kissed Eddie, and I didn't listen. How are we back on Eddie? Because I never said I was sorry... really sorry for not hearing you when you said you felt lonely, but I am. What if the test results come back positive? - We'll deal with it. - No. We won't. We won't be around. It'll be Tess who's dealing with her sick and dying brother, who, according to all the websites that I consulted, could potentially die as early as 35. Okay, but what if we found out he had this when he was 2 or 12? Or what if we found out Tess had something serious, right? - We would deal with it. - I know. Because she's our kid. He's not... yet. Look, I'm just... I just wish I had more time to get my head wrapped around this. You know, when Sage first told me about this, all I could see was Sage dying and the baby dying. But then he was born, and I saw his face. And he's not dying. We got to look at this life in front of us. I mean really look at it. Look at his face. - I have looked at it. - Not really. You don't want to bond because you're scared, but I'm telling you... You got to look at this guy. Okay, you know what? I'll make Sage avocado toast. You... you just feed this guy, okay? Just... Hey, uh, some people are bringing water over to the police station. - I thought I'd bring some here. - Oh, great, thanks. - Yeah. - Sam? Hey, there. I was hoping I'd run into you. I miss you. Uh, Sam, have you met my son-in-law Evan? - Evan Norris. - Hey. Sam Baldwin. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, nice to meet you. - I'm gonna go. - Okay. - I didn't know that was Evan. - No, it's okay, it's okay. Do you think everyone knows we're a thing? Well... Anthony's onto us for sure, and now Evan is, too, which means he and Luly are gonna talk about it. And then Luly will put it in her new column, and then the whole town will know. - Wow. - Wow. Um, tell me that you're here to say I can go home. It's still too dangerous. I'm sorry. I'm just so worried that I lost everything. Well... you got five kids, a bunch of dads, and... you got a guy who loves you, and a Crab Shack that is gonna feed the whole town. So I'd say you got a lot. Did you just bury the lede? Yeah, I didn't... I didn't want to freak you out. Yeah, you didn't. - See you. - See you. Hey, Larry, can I talk to you, please? Yeah, sure. You got to walk, though. I'm on Hope duty. She likes motion. They're not gonna rebuild. - Who? - Us... uh, Gladwell. That was Chris Ashford. He's the SVP of acquisitions. And they are not rebuilding the Crab Shack. They want to diversify their portfolio beyond restaurants, and so they're... they're gonna put in high-rise condos. They can't do that. It's not zoned for residential. They're having it re-zoned. It's happening. Where is he staying? The Alida Hotel? The Andaz? Please don't, because I wasn't supposed to say anything to anybody. He's at the Alida. Keep her moving. This won't take me long. Maybe Peter thinks he's meeting us at the social worker's? I told him we were meeting here. I texted it to him. I left him a message. - Now he's not picking up. - Is he... Is he having second thoughts? Yeah, yeah, he is, but I thought we had worked it out. You know what? Maybe, uh... Maybe he called my phone. - Oh. - Did he call? Uh, no, the genetic test results are back. Yeah, Chris Ashford, Gladwell Group? Uh, yeah. Oh, hey. Larry, right? From the Perry conglomerate. Yeah, that's right. Uh, listen... I helped negotiate the sale of the Crab Shack to your company. And the Gladwell Group agreed to keep the Crab Shack running in a manner that was in harmony with the way the Perry family saw it... A place that sells well-priced local seafood, not high-rise condominiums. Why don't you have a seat? Can I buy you a drink? This doesn't have to be acrimonious. No, it doesn't... as long as you live up to your end of the bargain. Look, Larry, well-priced seafood doesn't make the company as much money as high-end condominiums. This is business. It's not personal. It's personal to me. I have a granddaughter... that I don't get to see because I screwed up. My daughter has no faith in me. The Perry family does. They trusted me when I suggested selling the Crab Shack, and I gave them my word that the Gladwell Group would protect Scott's legacy. Well, you probably shouldn't have done that. Please, Chris... I'm begging you. Please don't. It's not gonna change anything. You sure you don't want a drink? No. No, I don't. You okay? That's good. That's really good. Here. - You been crying? - No. I cry all the time. I spent the past month basically just crying in Vegas. - Bet you didn't know that. - Yeah, how would I? You didn't answer any of my calls. I'm sorry, Theo. And I'm sorry Jules is going to college. - She broke up with me. - What? - When? - Just now. She texted me. She's not coming home. She said that she wants to finish her school year in Atlanta, and then she's gonna go to California. She thought we should make a clean break. I'm sorry. - Whatever. - Hey. Hey, no. We don't do that. We don't minimize, okay? Did you love her? Oh, come here, buddy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about me. I'm sorry about Jules. I'm... I'm just sorry, okay? What do we do? Call the social worker. Tell her we're not coming. Okay. - Daddy, I missed you. - Baby. Oh! Oh, I missed you, too. Why didn't you tell me where you were going? - You had us worried sick. - I got in the car to think. And pretty soon I realized I was driving to pick up Tess. Tess, this is Sage. - Hey. - Hi. She's gonna be in our life, so you're gonna know her pretty well. And this is Hampton. It was your dad's choice. I didn't see it at first... until I really looked at him, but it's who he is. Fred Hampton was a Black Panther. He was a freedom fighter who gave his life for what he believed in. And we are gonna raise Hampton to know his history and to be a strong black man. And that means he won't always be strong. He'll be scared and weak sometimes, too. And that's okay. Look, I'm sorry, but I want to be Hampton's dad more than anything. Sage, it's up to you. You've seen a side of us that isn't perfect, but... we will love him. I promise you that. I don't want perfect parents. And the fact that you aren't perfect actually makes me feel... better. Like, everybody has struggles. I mean, I do. But I feel okay leaving him with you. You want to hold him? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. Watch his head. Yeah. Peter, do you want to know the results? It's okay. Like Ollie said, there will be a cure for this because we are going to raise money for research, and we are going to find a cure for Sage and for Hampton... He doesn't have it. But you all looked so sad and serious. Because we thought you'd bailed. I'm here. And we're still gonna find a cure for Sage. Can we do a family picture? Sage, get over here. Come on. All right. Everybody, "Hampton" on three. - One, two, three. - Hampton! Look at this, you guys. It feels like all of Savannah's here. It's amazing. There's Larry. Where's my baby? I just checked on her. Margot has her inside. She's napping. Robin, I need to talk to you. Larry, look around. Scotty would be so happy to see the way the whole community's rallied around the Crab Shack. Hey, I just saw Tess. She told me the good news. - Congratulations. - Yep, he's ours. This is Hampton. Hey, little Hampton. You know, you got some pretty cool dads there. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Listen, uh, can I call a Council meeting? I got some things I'd like to say. Oh, my God. This coat. Oh, some guy just dropped it off. - It's nice. - This was my dad's. We donated a bunch of his clothes to a secondhand store after he died. - Wow, that's crazy. - I have chills. I have these moments, you know, where I know he's here. And right now, he's here. He's watching over me. - You okay? - Yeah. It's not a sad feeling. It feels good to remember him. I think that's why people are responding to my article. They want to be able to keep the people they lost alive. There you are. Hey, Denise, uh, how's your mom? I heard that she had a lot of water damage. Yeah, I'm... I'm taking her back to Atlanta with me. Oh, no. We're gonna miss her. She'll be back, but we want you to do to her house what you did with yours. You know, make it all safe and pretty. Fix the foundation, open up the walls, new bathroom. The old grandpa dude... What's his name? Larry, he said that's what you guys are doing... Fixing houses. Uh... uh, yeah. Great, here's my contact information. Send me a bid, and let's get started. I'm gonna go get some food. I just got my first paying customer. Oh, 'cause you're amazing. And me having the sense to marry you... That's my dad looking out for me. - So sweet. - Oh, my God. Hey. - Theo made this? - Yep. - It's good, right? - It's great. - Not eating your soup, Larry? - No, it's good. I'm just not hungry. So I have a proposal to make. - Theo wants to learn to cook. - Mm-hmm. And there's not a first-rate cooking school in Savannah. So I'm gonna create one for him right here at the Crab Shack. Jules broke up with him. He feels like everyone leaves him, and I want to be someone who doesn't leave. I need a family. And I'm not talking biology. I know I'm not Luly's dad. But let me back on the Council. Let me be the man that Scott always believed I could be. Anthony, I'm not sure there even is a Council anymore. I mean, it's... it's been a year. And besides that, Gladwell would have to agree to hire you back. Well, I think it's worth asking them. Well, that's another thing. The Gladwell guy hates me, and I'm... Not sure Margot likes me much better either. So... I was... I was hoping you, Larry, might be able to speak to Chris, smooth things over. We never should've sold it to them. No, Larry. No, selling this place was the best thing I ever did. I mean, if I still owned it, this hurricane might've been the last straw. It would've been one thing too many for me. But knowing that they have deep pockets, they can take care of this place, and that's a godsend. That means that Scotty's legacy can continue. And, hey, we have you to thank for that. - Larry... - Hey. We have you to thank for that. Don't cry. I'm telling you a good thing. Robin. Uh, sorry to interrupt. The road to your house is open. If you want, I can take you there. Uh... Yeah. Watch your step. - It's still standing. - Yep. Do you mind if I go in and look? You remember when we first moved in? This house was a disaster. It was so rundown. You promised it'd be okay... that we'd fill this place with kids, love, and laughter. And... And we did. We did it. Oh, the kids. How are they? They're gonna have a hard time with this. Their stuff's all ruined. But... It's just stuff. I'm still standing, Scotty. I know. You're doing great. You'd be so proud of the kids. We talk about you all the time. I hear you. The dads... That was hard at first. But you were right... I needed them. I keep asking if you'd forgive Anthony. - I think I would. - I think you would. You're such a good person. I'm so lucky that I had you. Because of you, I have five kids... And a pack of dads, and... my life is full of so much love. I met a guy... Sam. I like him. I might even love him. And pretty soon, I'm gonna introduce him to the kids. You should. You know you're the love of my life, right? And that's never gonna change. You should go. He's waiting for you. When Scott asked us to be on his council, he said he didn't expect us to love his family the way he did, but he figured we would... and he was right. So the house... It's bad, you guys. But we are gonna be just fine. - My stuff? - It's pretty much ruined. Where will we live while we fix it? I don't know yet. Well, how long is it gonna take to fix? Don't know yet, but I know that we are gonna be just fine because we have each other. - And the Council. - That's right. And... mwah... Anthony is gonna teach Theo how to cook. And Luly's gonna write a column. And Oliver's gonna raise a super-cute baby with Peter. And we're gonna help. I don't think this council should be a one-way street anymore. I think we need them, but I think they need us just as much. So that's how we're gonna do it. And do it together. And I know we got a lot of work ahead of us, but, you guys, we have so much to be grateful for. We really do. And I promise to get permission from anyone I write about. Thanks, Lu. Wait, where's Larry? They say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Vodka, neat. And so is a family. So how do we survive? Reach out, check in, love one another... 'cause no one survives alone. _ CREDITS
