 The plane! The plane! Tattoo. Tattoo, you don't even have your coat on yet? It's not my fault, boss. The plane is an hour early. Early? It's right on time as it always is. On time? That's impossible. My watch. Yes, Tattoo? - It's not ticking anymore. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You're sorry? You're sorry? You know how much that watch cost me? Well, evidently a great deal more than it's worth. Now come along. We wouldn't want to be late. Smiles, everyone. Smiles.

 We want our guests to feel welcome. Ann and her brother, Tony. Just look at the excitement in their eyes. And that's their parents, right, boss? Uh, half right, Tattoo. Ann and Tony's parents are divorced. That is their mother, Evelynee Kellino. And the gentleman with her is her fiancé, Carlyle Cranston. I understand he's quite respected in Boston banking circles. And a Boston banker can surely afford a full price for his fantasy. Of course, Tattoo, if the fantasy they were to be involved in were his. No, Tattoo, this fantasy is very special and very inexpensive. As a matter of fact, it cost exactly... $51.

 Fifty-one dollars? Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Shane. Are they paying for their fantasy? Oh, most assuredly, Tattoo. The full price you'll be happy to know. Mr. Shane is a very famous attorney, with one deeply troubling problem. Miss Jane Howell. Is she Mr. Shane's problem? Yes. You see, when Miss Howell was about 13 years old, she suffered amnesia. Is that her husband? Bill Jordan is Miss Howell's fiancé. They plan to be married next month. And Mr. Shane want us to find out who Miss Howell really is? Oh, very much so, Tattoo. She might be the long-missing daughter... of a rich rubber plantation owner named Jonathan Connors. And if she is, what happens then? Then Mr. Shane will give Miss Howell... the sum of $30 million. Dear guests, I am Mr. Roarke, your host. Welcome to Fantasy Island. - Children. - Hi, Mr. Roarke. Are you enjoying the food? Yes, sir. It's terrific. You seem to have a way with children. I'll be anxious to see the survival camp you've built for their stay. Oh, I'm sure you'll find it quite, uh, intriguing, Mr. Cranston. But he doesn't have to see it, does he? I thought only the parents had to approve the camp. Oh, but I'm sure your mother has come to rely quite a bit... on Mr. Cranston's judgment, sweetheart. Yes, of course. I wouldn't dream of leaving you both there, unless Uncle Carlyle and I both approve of the facility. Something wrong, Ann? No. No, of course not. Oh, uh, by the way, where are the other campers and their parents? Yes, we seem to be the only ones here. - Ah, the rest of your party. - The rest? Annie McGranny! Tony Baloney! Hey, Dad! Harry. Daddy! What on earth is Harry doing here? With his fiancée. It is my policy that both parents must examine... and approve the camping facilities before the session begins. I'm sorry if you weren't informed. It's really too bad the original Connors plantation house was destroyed by fire. It would have been best to take Jane back there to the island where she grew up... to awaken her memory. But since that was not possible, we have re-created it here. Amazing. It's exactly like Connors's old place. I think you'll find more than just the house... has been re-created here. - Bill, those drums. - You must be mad. You didn't bring them here too, did you? What are they? What are you talking about? They're voodoo drums. Voodoo? Oh, come on. We're not going back to the Stone Age, are we? Close enough. Connors's family exploited the natives on their island for five generations. Voodoo was the only thing they could fight back with. And you take that hocus-pocus seriously? Connors did. He lived the last few years of his life in absolute terror. There was a high voodoo priest, a juju man named Jamu, who ordered the plantation house burned down after Connors's death. And you brought this voodoo priest here now? Well, if Jane is to have a true test of her memory, it is important that as many things be the same as they were all those years ago. Even... the fear that permeated the land. Huh. This is crazy. Come on. Come on, honey. We're getting out of here. You're all free to return to the main house if you wish. But if you do, I promise you... the secret of Jane's past will be locked here forever. Bill, I wanna stay. Yeah, but voodoo, honey. I mean, who knows what these people might do if they think you're Connors's daughter. Mr. Jordan is right, Miss Howell. If you choose to stay, I will not discount the possible danger to yourself. I understand. Bill, please, you must understand. I have to stay. I have to find out if I'm the little girl that lived here. Then may I wish you all a very pleasant weekend. Oh, uh, the Jeeps will return for you Monday morning. Excuse me. Well, at least they've stopped. Well, we might as well go inside. Anything, honey? Hmm? Do you remember anything at all? I don't know. I think so, but... Who's that? It's Mama La. Where did Mr. Roarke find her? You've been searching for Mama La for years. I'm beginning to think that Mr. Roarke has a way of doing things the rest of us don't. Mama La? The nanny that raised the Connors's girl? I bet my life on it. Hey, what are you... It's all right. - How you get that scar? - I don't know. Jane doesn't remember anything before the age of 13. Does that scar mean something to you, Mama La? Well? I have work to do. Well, these are the camp facilities for the children. Does anyone wish to inspect the premises further? Is this some kind of joke? Mom, look, isn't it something? It's just like our old cabin, the one we used to rent every summer by the lake. Oh, don't be silly, darling. Our old cabin was quite different. Remember, there was an old swing hanging from the tree, a rain barrel near the porch... and the place was just hopping with frogs. Like this one? Well, it... it can't be the same, but it... does seem... Oh, we had such good times there. Remember, nobody wanted my paintings. Not even for target practice. But we always managed to scrape up enough... to rent that broken-down, wonderful old cabin. Yes. Well, I'm sure it was very nice... then. Yes, well, I think we'd better look the place over and leave quickly. Let's get on with it, shall we? Mr. Roarke, how'd you do it? It's our cabin. It really is. Yeah, Mom and Dad always loved being here. Yes, I know. Perhaps they will again. But whatever happens, the matter now rests entirely in your hands. Our hands? Yes. We didn't think we'd have to... Would have to what, Ann? Well... I could be wrong, Mr. Roarke, but I'm getting the distinct feeling... that some sort of explanation is in order. It is indeed, Mr. Cranston. The truth is I'm afraid you've all been brought here under false pretenses. I knew there was something strange about a children's camp that required parents to visit. I mean, real camps are so parents can get rid of kids. Really? Well, as you know, this is Fantasy Island, a place where people come to realize their secret wishes. You are here because the children, Ann and Tony, have a fantasy they wish fulfilled. The children? Just exactly what is their fantasy, Mr. Roarke? Oh, it's a very common one, Mr. Kellino. One shared by many children all over the world. They want to see their mothers and fathers in love with each other again, like they were when the family was whole and happy. You mean, there is no survival camp? On the contrary, Miss Arnold, you're in it. And it's all of you who must survive with one another... until we return for you after the weekend. Will you excuse me? N-Now wait a minute. Now, now, wait, wait. Just wait a minute. Where are you going? You can't just leave us here. Oh, I assure you I can, Mr. Cranston. Uh, you'll find everything you need. There is a change of clothes in the cabin. And in the woods and the lake, all the food you could hope to eat. But this is absurd. This is incredible. Indeed. This is Fantasy Island. Now, Ann Kellino, you have some explaining to do. ♪♪ ♪♪ Jane? Honey, it's me. Is anything... Um... All right. It's okay, honey. All right, stay still. Easy. All right. It's gonna be all right. Easy. Watch your hand. Watch it. Watch it. Oh, Bill! It's all right. It's okay. Take it easy. Take it easy. I'm here. Nothing's gonna hurt you. ♪♪ Whoa, boy, I've forgotten how cold it gets in the woods at night. I think we all better spend the night here in the cabin where we have a fire. Remember when it snowed at the lake, and it wasn't even winter. Oh, that was years ago. It's over and done with. You shouldn't... Oh, I'm sorry, Ann. It's... It's been a difficult day. Well, I for one am ready for bed. The sooner I'm asleep and unconscious, the better I'll like it here. Grace, you've taken the words right out of my mouth. Now, as to the sleeping arrangements, I've given that some thought. I thought you might. Tony and you and I will sleep in the bedroom, which is colder. And Ann and Grace and Evelynee will sleep by the fire. Now, if that's agreeable, naturally. That's terrific, Carlyle. Let's go get the cots from the bedroom, bring them by the fire. Yes, I'll help. If Mom and Dad don't get together soon, they never will. Yeah. But what can we do about it? I don't know. But one thing's for sure. Uncle Carlyle's sleeping arrangements aren't helping matters. ♪♪ ♪♪ Mama La, what are you doing? Just cold. Make sure blanket on. I heard noises. I was singing. Sing Haitian lullaby like when Marian was young. Well, I think she's sleeping now. You better go and get some sleep yourself. Hurry up, Grace. The light's just right. I don't know. Maybe we were wrong. Maybe Mom and Dad are happier with Grace and what's-his-name. You know that isn't true. It can't be. At least they don't argue anymore. Yeah, but they don't laugh either. There's just gotta be a way to get Dad and Mom alone. You mean without Grace and what's-his-name. No, I mean alone, alone. Just the two of them out in the wilderness, where they spent their honeymoon, where we spent all those happy vacations. How come they have to be alone? I mean, what can they do alone they can't do with us? Are you sure you're 13? - That's it. - That's what? The barn. A place where they can be alone. A place where maybe they can remember what it was like just being people. - You really think it'll work? - It's gotta work. If I could just figure out how. Well, I still don't understand why they have to be alone. Don't worry about it. I'm sure it'll all make sense in a couple of years. Come on. Good day, Miss Hogan. Miss Hogan? Miss Hogan. Oh, Mr. Roarke, I'm so sorry. I just didn't see you. I'm afraid I'm in such a dither. Oh, nothing wrong I hope. Wrong? What possibly could be wrong when you have given me... the most perfect fantasy a girl could ever have. If it was so perfect, why are you in such a dither? Why? But how can I not be? I mean, how can a girl choose between Robert Redford and Burt Reynolds? - Are they both here? - Well, it's your fantasy, Miss Hogan. I'm afraid you'll just have to solve your dilemma on your own. Oh, Mr. Roarke, I was hoping you'd say that. Well, I guess me and the boys will just have to keep trying. Boss, how do you do it? How indeed. I only wish I had his stamina. That juju man is something else. Juju man very powerful. Yes, we know, Mama La. Juju man make strong medicine. Bill, stop it. Mama La believes in that. Please don't make fun of her. All right, I'm sorry. I guess it's... Well, I think his being out there is just getting on my nerves. I know. Why does he hate me so? - He's afraid of you. - But why? I would never hurt him. I don't even know him. Jamu and his followers are afraid you will go back to the island. Then it will be as it was when your father was alive. All will belong to you. But there's no more plantation. Jane wouldn't rebuild the plantation anyway. What's he got to be afraid of? You ask? I tell. Well, I don't believe it. There must be some way to talk to him... or some way to explain. ♪♪ - How you know that? - I just know it. Why? What's so special about that tune? That Haitian song. I teach my baby when she was young. I must say I admire your persistency, Tattoo. You've been working on that watch almost two days now. I am going to write a letter to Ralph Nader. He should make them send me a new one. I hope I'm not disturbing you, but, um, you did attend to the details... of the children's fantasy as I requested, did you not? Of course, of course. Don't I always take care of details? But it does not mean it's going to work. May I? Thank you. Patience, Tattoo. May I? Thank you. You must learn the art of patience. And also, once you've set the proper elements in motion, anything is possible. It's ticking. Indeed. But I am curious. Do you really have doubts... that we can deliver Ann and Tony's fantasy? I'm afraid, boss, that their fantasy is not as easy as fixing a watch. I feel sorry for the kids. Why? Well, I've done everything you asked. But for your plan to work, it will have to rain. Oh, yes, Tattoo, yes. I'm well aware of that fact. But it has not rained on Fantasy Island in nine years. I believe it's been nine and a half years to be exact. Hey. Darling, what is it? It's Tony, Mom. He's real upset. He ran out of the boys' room crying and went out to the barn. But what's he upset about? You and Dad, Mom. What else? And he's all alone out there. You know he's afraid of the dark. Okay. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Dad, it's Annie. She went out to the barn. Good night, Son. She says she never wants to see you again. Not ever. She doesn't mean that. Yes, she does. She's really upset. Well, I'll go talk to her. Where'd you say she was? In the barn. Good night. You go back to bed. Annie? Annie McGranny. Come on, Ann, darling. You're too old to be doing... So are we. Evvie, what are you doing... The children. Annie, Tony, come on! Ann! Tony! Hey, you guys, open that up. Open this door right away. Come on. Oh! Well, there must be another way out of this place. Not if I know your two children there isn't. Boy, wait till I get my hands on them tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'm not spending the entire night locked in here with you. What's the matter? You think Mr. Cranston is liable to misread our little tête-à-tête? Well, you must admit it would be a pretty good case of circumstantial evidence... if we spent the whole night together in here. I mean, even for him. What are you trying to tell me? That he's not one of the brightest legal lights aglow? I can't imagine your little flower of Dixie would be too pleased herself. Evvie. How did we ever pick ourselves two such winners? Well, I don't know. Maybe we were trying to escape from each other. Hey, I think I've got it. Oh, wonderful. We're gonna saw our way out with this. Well, no, not exactly. But I thought if we could stick this blade through the door, then we might be able to lift the bar up. Hey, I think you've got something. Gimme that thing. Hey, I think this might work. Here, let me give you a hand. Oh, I think it's coming. I think this is it. I've got it. I got it. That's it. Oh! Just keep calm, Evvie. Keep calm. Go for the loft. Keep calm. Go for the loft. Come on. He's coming this way. Oh! Push the ladder down. Push the ladder. He's... He's going to sleep. Do you believe this? No. And I know a couple of people who ain't gonna believe it either. Well, Tattoo, what do you think? Will it work out? I sure hope so. Do you have any idea how much it costs to rent a bear these days? You do have a cash register for a heart. Tattoo! How shameful! ♪♪ I think I found it, everybody. I think I found it. What? A way of proving you're who you think you are. I was going through some old papers of mine relating to the estate. And I suddenly remembered something as I was reading through an old ledger... I had made up for Connors. I'd flown down to the plantation... to bring him some documents he had to sign, and he told me about the girl's dog. It had died the day before. He said the dog was very special to his daughter. And she'd insisted on burying it alone. So, they had a casket made. Then she took it, and, uh, she buried it. So? Well, don't you see? It's something only Connors's daughter would have known. Nobody else saw her bury it. Do you remember any of this? Yeah. My baby buried dog alone. Jane? I don't remember. It's okay, honey. I mean, if it's true, it'll come to you. But if it isn't, hey, it's you and me, babe. Say, maybe that crazy Jamu can help you. - No. - He could help, couldn't he? Yeah, but he wants you dead. You'll have to talk to him, Mama La. You'll have to tell Jamu that I don't wanna hurt him. That if I am Jonathan Connors's daughter, that I'll give the island back to him and his people. Wait. This is absolutely not possible. This isn't the same island. So how could the dog be buried here? It's possible. What? You too? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore, except that Mr. Roarke... seems capable of almost anything. Now, he said that everything will be the same. I still say it's impossible. Well, there's one sure way of finding out. Bill, if Jamu can make me remember where I buried the dog, then I am Marian Connors. If I'm not, who cares? At least I'll know the truth. Mama La, I've got to know. Please, don't make me do it. Mama La, if Jamu can do it, you have to help me. Do as she says, Mama La. I will speak to Jamu. ♪♪ Come. Hey, I don't like this. Let's go back, Douglas, now, before it's too late. Already too late. Come. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Pepe. Pepe. Pepe was the name of her dog. ♪♪ Where's she going? What'd he do to her? Jane? Honey? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What happened? Nothing. Just some superstitious mumbo jumbo. No, she knows now. I remember. I buried my dog there. Are you sure? Well, there's one way to find out. All right. Here goes. ♪♪ I just hit something. I Did it! I did it! I did it! That's... That's the casket that my daddy made for my dog! I-I am Jonathan Connors's daughter. Thank God we found you. Oh, we're happy for you. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I think... I think this calls for a celebration. You got any champagne in the house, Mama La? I wonder if you might postpone that for a while. Mr. Roarke, I'm satisfied that she is indeed... Jonathan's daughter, Marian Connors. - So it will appear. - What do you mean by that? Nothing, it's just a figure of speech. Mama La, would you mind seeing to my guests for a bit? I'd like a word with Jane, alone. Well, what do you want with her? Please, Mr. Jordan, indulge me. It is extremely important... to all of you. Well, then we'll go inside. Is that all right? That will be just fine. I won't be long. Jane. Mr. Roarke, where are we going? Patience, Miss Howell. What do they want? Harry! Oh, Carlyle. Well, I can't find Evelynee. I don't know where she is. And Harry's gone with her evidently. Well, what in the world is going on around here? Do you two know anything about this? Hey, I bet you guys wondered where we were. To put it mildly, yes. Well, we were, uh, lured into the barn. And, um, we had to spend the night in the hayloft because of the bear. The bear? Yeah. Big son of a gun. About 800 pounds of cheap fur coat. Anyway, he chased us up into the loft. And well, we had to throw the ladder down so he couldn't get up after us, you see? This morning he was gone, so we jumped down on some bales of hay, and here we are. Here we are. It's the truth. Oh, sure, Harry. I wanna know what happened between you two last night. Maybe I shouldn't ask. Well, for one thing, we talked a lot. And for another? I think I know the answer to that question. And I also think, Grace, that you and I are not wanted here anymore. Carlyle, I'm sorry. Grace, I-I don't know what to say. Good-bye would do nicely. Does this mean what I think it does? Well, it means your mom and I are gonna give it another try. Great. Only this time, don't louse it up, please. This time I don't think we will. And we have you two guys to thank for getting us together again. It only took six months of our allowance. Yeah, but it was worth all of our allowances for the rest of our lives. Yeah. Where do you think Roarke took her? Stop worrying, Bill. She's in good hands. I know. I know that. It's just that... What happened? Are you all right? They... They stopped me on the road. I tried to fight them off, but... Who? Who stopped you? Jamu's followers. I miscalculated terribly. Jane... Jane. Where is she? What's happened to her? They killed her. Oh! Oh, my God. Are you sure? I'm sure. I saw them do it. I tried to protect her, but I was lucky to escape with my own life. Are you badly hurt? If I could have some brandy, please. Brandy. You dumb... You dumb old woman. You and that voodoo. I told you not to use them. - What are you talking about? - They've killed her. What? Jane is dead. Those voodoo people took her away and killed her! After all that work. Months of programming her. So she knew about the plantation. She knew about her childhood. And we succeeded. We made it. She believed it all. She never suspected that she wasn't who we told her she was. And then you get involved with those voodoo people. You blew it! We're gonna wind up with nothing! - She can't be dead. - Well, believe me, she's dead. Roarke just told us. Roarke? Yes, Roarke. Yes, it was a trick. A terrible, dirty trick. Just like you played on Jane. She is Mr. Connors's daughter. The scar, the lullaby. Stop it, Mama La. Mr. Roarke explained everything to me, about how Bill programmed me into remembering things. And how you continued it, by singing me to sleep at night. How could you do that to me? For the money, Jane. That's all either of them ever cared about. I loved you, Bill. I... I wanna thank you, Mr. Roarke. Me too. Believe me, it was my pleasure to serve you. And we want you to know it was worth every penny of that $51. Yeah. I'm glad to hear that. At least they are satisfied customers. Maybe they'll come back again. Only next time, not at children's prices. Mr. Roarke, I don't know what to say, but this weekend has been an awakening for me. - No regrets? - No. I'll get over Bill. It'll take a while. But I'm glad that I found out about him now instead of after we were married. But the $30 million, you must be disappointed. No, I never really wanted it anyway. All I wanted was to find out who I am. I'm sorry we couldn't have helped you more in that direction. Oh, but you did, in a way. See, now I know who I'm not. And that's more than a lot of people can say about themselves. Thank you. Bye-bye. Good-bye, Mr. Roarke. Thank you for everything. Oh, it was our pleasure. The, uh... Yes, Mr. Shane? The things that the, uh, voodoo man did, those happenings, they were all tricks, weren't they? Were they? But voodoo? That's impossible. Who knows, Mr. Shane? This is Fantasy Island, and here anything is possible. Yeah.
