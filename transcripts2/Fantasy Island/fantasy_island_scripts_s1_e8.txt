I thought we decided to try to cultivate our finer instincts today, didn't we? - Yes, but I changed my mind. - What? Today I decide to be selfish. Why? - Look at this beautiful island. - Yes. All our beautiful people just waiting for those strangers to arrive. Waiting to serve them, to make their dreams come true. Well, why not, Tattoo? Why not?

 After all, our guests pay extremely well for that privilege. Hmm. Some of them pay a lot of money. The others, you practically give them their fantasies. I give up. How can I ever balance the books? Tattoo... Tattoo, I told you. I only cut our price... when I find their fantasies either particularly deserving or intriguing. That's just what I mean, boss. You give them their fantasies. What about me? I have some very intriguing fantasies. - You, Tattoo? - Do you wanna hear some? Oh, of course. You're making a joke. Very amusing, Tattoo. A joke? What do you mean by "a joke"? Well, everyone knows that he who works in a candy store... has no desire for sweets.

 I suppose that's Hemingway. No. That, Tattoo, is Roarke. Move. Smiles, everyone. Smiles. Oh, come on, Tattoo. Let's see some sunshine on that cherubic face of yours. Splendid. Perhaps, just perhaps, this may be the flight... which brings one of your fantasies to light. - Really? Which one? - In good time, Tattoo. In good time. Miss Sally Quinn. The name doesn't connote wonders, does it? I never heard of her. Neither has anyone else. Since the age of six, she's spent her life removed from the real world... in one strict boarding school after another, courtesy of her father. She's a very pretty girl to have been locked away in school all those years. Oh, she is that, and she comes by her good looks naturally, Tattoo. It was just 24 years ago this month that Sally's late mother... was crowned the most beautiful woman in the world. And now she wants us to try to help her follow in her mother's footsteps. In her mother's footsteps? How? Patience, patience. Are they together? They are indeed, Tattoo. The men are business partners. They own a small New York advertising agency. The first man, Mr. James Defoe, is creative director. The other man is Stuart Chambers. It is he who goes out and gets the accounts. "Hustling" is the expression, I believe. And the lady? Mrs. Chambers... Andrea. Andrea? A very pretty name for a very pretty lady. But what fantasy could those three share? A very common one, Tattoo. A thirst for adventure and money. Money? On Fantasy Island? Treasure, Tattoo. Pirate treasure. The lost treasure of Carvajal? But, boss, it's too dangerous. The last time, you say that no one will be allowed to search for it again. That was before these three requested their fantasy. What's so special about them? The fact that one member of this happy trio... plans to commit a murder before the weekend is over. My dear guests, I am Mr. Roarke, your host. Welcome to Fantasy Island. You must be famished after your trip, Miss Quinn. I hope you find something to your liking. It all looks great. Thanks. It's just that I'm, um... A bit nervous? Ah, rest assured there's nothing to be concerned about. The contest will begin as planned. Oh, in fact, the other contestants and the news media from around the world... have begun arriving at the north end of the island and will be transported here presently. You'll meet them all later at an informal press conference... I've arranged for you and all the other girls. You make it sound so easy. On Fantasy Island everything is easy, Miss Quinn, if I wish it to be. You better eat now. You'll need your strength the next couple of days. Thank you. You've made me feel at home. I'm glad. You know, boss, I like that girl you were talking to. Mm-hmm. She look nice. Oh, yes. But how can we help her to follow in her mother's footsteps? Well... I know you're going to hate this, Tattoo, but tomorrow we begin staging the first annual Miss Fantasy Island beauty pageant, featuring 16 of the most exquisitely beautiful girls in the world. - You don't mean that, boss. - Don't I? But how can this help Miss Quinn? Simple. Sally is one of the contestants, and in the end... she will be crowned the most beautiful of all: queen of Fantasy Island. Don't you see? You mean the contest is fixed? I like the word "predetermined." - Fixed. - Well, it's her fantasy, Tattoo. Ah, cheer up. Cheer up. Maybe you can console one of the losers. Thank you. I can't believe this. I mean, three grown people... out here on a... a desert island looking for buried treasure. You sound skeptical, Mrs. Chambers. The treasure does exist, I assure you. And worth millions too. You'll have to forgive my wife, Mr. Roarke. She's not a romantic. Right, Jim? Oh, she's as romantic as any woman is these days. Oh, thanks. The, um, Carvajal map. Study it carefully, will you? The pirate Carvajal, scourge of the Caribbean. Scourge? Cutthroat, you mean. He's literally correct. Ah, when Carvajal buried his treasure, he buried four of his most trusted men along with it to guarantee their silence. And don't forget the curse, boss. The curse? There's a curse on it too? Oh. Ah, not to be taken lightly, Mrs. Chambers. If the curse is to be believed, the same... greed that drove Carvajal to murder his own men... will forever afterward plague those who seek the prize. You're serious about this, aren't you? Um, in your packs on the burro you will find supplies sufficient for three days. Good luck and, um, good hunting. Excuse me. All right. What do we got? Well, the map says Devil's Peak is that way. Well, let's do it. Hold it, please. Girls, together now. Come on, big smiles. Come on. Get it together. Over here. Nice smile. One more. Look this way. Good, good. Wonderful. Very nice. All right. In the back, let's see those teeth. You see, Tattoo, life does have its rewards. I'm beginning to believe it. Ah, Tattoo, why don't you mingle with our lovely guests and make them feel welcome? If you say so, boss. I want a good shot there. Yeah, that's great. How do you like your fantasy so far, Miss Quinn? Oh, it's exciting and a little frightening. Frightening? Why? They're all beautiful. Yes, exquisite. And each one thinks she has a chance. Ah, tomorrow the first round of judging begins. Tomorrow? And in the contest everything will go just as you wish. Well, you have fun. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, for the next half hour... our beautiful contestants will be available for individual photographs or interviews. After which will be a special... Whoo. My feet are so sore. Oh, but wasn't it exciting? All those people and cameras and everything? I can tell you we never had anything like that in Ben Bolt, Texas. I reckon that must sound pretty "hicky" to you, being educated in schools all around the world. No. Believe me, boarding schools aren't all they're cracked up to be. I was a little nervous myself. Maybe, but you sure didn't look nervous about whether you were gonna win or lose. Elaine, have you ever been in a beauty contest before? Sure. Well, just hometown stuff. This is my first big international beauty contest. Mine too. If you don't mind me being too personal, why did you enter? This could mean a lot to me. A down payment on a place for my folks. A chance to travel and see things... and never have to work in a cheesy five-and-dime or greasy chili palace again... and maybe even... Listen to me. Actin' like I'm the only one around. I guess it means a lot to you too. Yeah. It does. Anybody here have some Vaseline? I've got some photographers waiting. - Here you go, honey. - Oh, thanks. Don't blind yourself. Don't worry. I won't. Who was that? That was Shirl Dean, and boy, does she spell trouble. Trouble? Didn't you see her? She's won so many contests they call her Miss Everything. Then why does she keep doing it? Probably because she's afraid there's nothin' else she can do. Huh. Unless I miss my guess, it's right up there. Treasure's somewhere on the other side in a cave. Here, watch your step. Give me your hand. Whoo! We made it. Only made part of it. We got a long way to go yet. Yeah. Be careful, Andie. Watch it! Watch out! Help! Hang on. Come on, Stuart. Pull. Here. Watch it. Aaah. You okay? Yeah. How about you? All right. Tattoo. Yes, boss? When we resume our game of Monopoly tonight, after your first victory in 2,736 games, perhaps we should use my dice, not yours. What do you think? Ah, sounds like a wonderful idea, boss. I'm glad you like it. Mr. Quinn just arrived. Sally's father. Just in time. Show him in, Tattoo. Show him in. Ah, Mr. Quinn, I'm Mr. Roarke. Welcome to Fantasy Island. Ah, thank you. Thank you. I must say your cable was rather cryptic, Mr. Roarke. My daughter's here as part of a group of 16 girls. That's right. May I offer you some scotch? No, thank you. I'd better see Sally first. Well, it's, um, your brand. And, um, I still haven't answered your question. I wasn't aware that I asked you one. Your daughter disappears from a boarding school in Switzerland... and a week later turns up on a tropical island, and you are not interested in how or why she came here? Not interested? I've been out of my mind for a week, ever since the school called me and told me that Sally had disappeared. I've had half the police forces of the world looking for her. Of course I wanna know why she's here. Well, then may I suggest, Mr. Quinn, you finish your drink and follow me. Well, the tension is really mounting... here on our first day of judging of the Miss Fantasy Island beauty pageant. We've already selected three of our five finalists, so we're coming now to finalist number four. And finalist number four is... Elaine Benson. She's our delightful Elaine Benson, finalist number four. Now we come to the last finalist. Of course, all of these girls are beautiful... everything a girl should be. But only one of them... One girl more... - will make the list as finalist... - What is this? For queen of Fantasy Island competition tomorrow. Which one is it going to be? I tell you, the suspense is killing me. I'm sure it's doing the same to you. Here we go then. Our last finalist then, Miss Sally Quinn. What's this? Some kind of joke? Oh, I assure you, all the contestants are quite serious, including your daughter. I absolutely forbid it. She must withdraw from the contest right now. Well, I'm afraid the choice is not yours, Mr. Quinn. Sally came here and entered this contest on her own, and she is of legal age, isn't she? Sally. Sally? I want a good shot there. Yeah, that's great. Oh, wonderful. Yeah. Well, that's not half bad, Andie. Not half bad at all. Well, I'm just a wonder. Of course, you did have my best meal: canned beans and franks. Well, you are a wonder. Thanks. She's the best. Isn't she, Jim? Absolutely. Mm-hmm. She's a good sport too. Come here with a couple of overage Boy Scouts, chasin' after lost pirate's treasure. Now wait... Wait a second. Wait a second. I didn't exactly volunteer, darling. You did have to drag me here kicking and screaming, remember? Yeah, well, you won't be sorry when we find the, um, jewels and the gold doubloons. Oh, those gold doubloons. Yeah. Five million, they say, Carvajal buried. Five million. But look it... Stu, you act as if nobody has ever looked for this treasure before, these so-called doubloons. They failed. We won't. Big-city girl here. She doesn't believe in anything she can't see. Hmph. You know, that's your trouble, Andrea. Your imagination doesn't extend beyond Bloomingdale's next sale. Ho-ho-ho. Hey, um, remember last month when I was stuck in Muncie for three days? Mm-hmm. Ah, well, you want some real excitement, you try Muncie, Indiana for three days. I, um, missed my pretty lady here so much, I, um, called her at 3:00 in the mornin'. No answer. You want a real scare? You, um... You try callin' home at 3:00 a.m. from Muncie, Indiana. Wife not answerin' the phone. Stu, I told you. I unplugged the phone. Now we've been over this before. Look, I'm just tryin' to tell you, sweetheart, how much I love you. Well, I, um... I think I'll go get some wood. No, I'll go. It's my turn. He doesn't believe me about the phone. Oh, no. That's foolish. Do you believe me? Of course I do, dummy. Thanks. For what? To your health. Balloon! The balloon is here! I hope Mr. Milbank is satisfied. Ah, Mr. Roarke, I really did it. You made my fantasy come true. I really did go around the world in 80 days. It looks like you had fun. I had a wonderful time, Tattoo. There's so many things I want to talk to you about. I'm so excited. When can I take my next Jules Verne adventure, Mr. Roarke? Well, as soon as you and your assistant, Sam, are rested and ready, Mr. Milbank. Come along, Sam. Let us not dillydally. Go right ahead, Sam. Yeah. Sally? I, um... I thought you'd be coming through here again. Hello, Daddy. I was hoping we wouldn't have to meet quite yet. That's quite obvious. Now that we have, I want you to end this foolishness. I want you to go back to your room and pack your things, and I'll arrange for us to be on the first flight out of here. No. It's not your choice whether I stay or leave anymore. Isn't it? Whose choice is it? Mine! You can't order me around anymore! I'm 19, grown-up. You call this behavior grown-up? No, it's not only not grown-up, Sally. It's vain and impetuous and most of all thoughtless to the people who care about you. Is that what you told Mother all those years ago... when you met her in the beauty contest she had entered? That's different. Is it? Yeah. How? I want you to get packed and be ready to leave in an hour. No. What was that? I don't think I heard you. I said no. I'm not leaving until this contest is over. Sally, I'm your father. Since when? What was that? I asked since when have you been her father? Oh, I know you've spent money on Sally. But can you remember the last time you hugged her or kissed her? This is none of your business, Mr. Roarke. I'm afraid it is, Mr. Quinn. It became so when I promised Sally her fantasy. I love my daughter. You don't understand. Oh, but I do understand. I understand you very well, Mr. Quinn. I also understand your daughter... A girl who saved her allowances for who knows how long just to enter a beauty contest. Well, then if you understand so much, tell me, why did she do it? Why, indeed. Has it occurred to you... that the only person you cared for in your life was Sally's mother, and she was a beauty contest winner? - Nonsense. - Perhaps. But to a child growing up, things aren't always as they are to adults. Are you saying she's done this all for me? Just so that I could pay her some attention? Your daughter's real fantasy was to regain your love and affection. Why don't you try to fulfill that fantasy, Mr. Quinn? Oh, um, the contestants have the afternoon off. I think you might find a walk along the, um, lagoon rather pleasant. Thank you, Mr. Roarke. Thank you very much. Oops. We're... I think we're hung up on something. Yeah. What? Oh, wait. Let me just get one more picture. Come on. Come on, now. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let me check it out. Are you going in? What is it now? Oh, wait a second. - Ah. Oh, boy. It's mud. - Can I do something? - No, that's all right. Can you feel it? - Yeah. - Stuart, Jim. There's an alligator. - Where? - Right over there. - I'm stuck! Get the gun. It's loaded. It's already cocked. Shoot. Just shoot at the alligator. Hold on! Ah! Help me. Help. Get her in. Come on. Help me, Jim. Stu, hurry. There's an alligator right out there. Aaah. Oh. Oh. The pack! Thanks. Forget it. Any time. Any time at all. Hey, um, tell me, old chum, dear friend, business associate... Just for, um, a second or two when... When it looked like I might be that alligator's breakfast, did the thought of sole ownership of the agency enter your mind? Ah, just for the briefest moment... did you think of maybe lettin' my... hand slip away? Oh, Stuart. I'm gonna imagine that you're... that you're makin' a joke, old buddy. Besides, I need you, at least until we find the treasure. Yeah, but me outta the way, it's not a bad idea, is it? Huh? Is it, darling? Oh, Stuart. Mr. Roarke asked me to see you. I'm pleased you came. I won't quit the contest. You won't have to now. Not anymore. I think I know what it means to you now. It's just that it's a great opportunity for me. I mean, if I won. I know, Sally. I think it's wonderful. Sally, I'm not very good at making apologies. I guess... I'm not any better expressing my love... with those whom I care most about. But if I neglected to show you my love, please forgive me. Daddy. If you want me to, I'll withdraw from the contest. Now that is the nicest thing you could have said to me, but I won't let you, now that I know what it means to you. Not only do I want you in that contest, I want you to win it... and win it big for the both of us. Oh, I've got such plans, Sally. It'll be just like it was with your mother. Your picture all over the world. You'll make me the proudest father you've ever seen. Wait. Stop, stop, stop. Here. Let me take that for a while. I never said it was gonna be easy, you know. Hey, you guys, ah... I'm sorry about what happened back there on the raft. I, um... I didn't mean it. I guess I was a little scared, you know? Well, come on. Let's move on. - To where, Stu? - Devil's Peak. We're lost, Stu. We don't even have a compass. It went overboard with your backpack. What are we gonna do, walk around in circles? I agree with Jim. Why don't we just go back? No way. We've come this far. We're goin' all the way. Gonna go where all the way? How do we find Devil's Peak? Well, we're not gonna find it standin' around here. Come on. Ah, Miss Quinn. Won't you please come in? To what do we owe this pleasure? Please, won't you sit down? I'd like to withdraw from the contest. Withdraw? Why? I think you know why. The fantasy's over. You were right about my true motives trying to get my father's attention. Then your father has responded to your fantasy. Oh, I'm so happy for you. I don't think she's so happy, boss. My father has responded with attention, Mr. Roarke, only it's not as easy as I thought. I mean, I don't know if he really loves me... or if he just wants me to be famous like my mother was. He really loved her, you know? And maybe he just wants me to replace her. Oh, that's a harsh judgment to place on your father. But he keeps talking about Mother, saying how this contest will be just like it was then. Like he's trying to relive it all. Quite a dilemma. And, um, your solution is to withdraw? Yes. Do you realize just how much you and your father are really alike? What do you mean? Well, you both have the same solution to problems... to run and hide from the world. I thought it was gonna be so easy... the contest, my winning, my father. My dear Miss Quinn, life and human emotions are rarely that simple. You think I should stay in the contest. Oh, I think you should face life... and deal with this as it comes as best you can. The other girls... This contest really means so much to them too. It's not fair that this is fixed for me to win. You have learned a great deal this evening. From now on, the Miss Fantasy Island contest... is no longer f... Um, predetermined. If you win it now, it will be strictly on your own. Just as my mother did. If you win it, it will be just as your mother did. That's right. Straight ahead. Be careful. Watch where you put your hands. Stay close to the wall. I'm watching. I'm watching. Easy now. Careful. Don't look down. I can't help it. That's it. Careful. Get a good handhold. I got you. - Relax. Take it easy. - Oh, my God. You got her? Reach for a handhold. Andrea, I told you. You gotta hug the wall. All right. You okay? That's it. Oh. They could have been killed. Need I remind you, Tattoo, there are no guarantees on Fantasy Island. Our guests take their chances. But, boss, that's not good for business. But at least they are closer to the treasure now. Yes, and now they approach their greatest danger. They must face their own greed. Look at the size of that cave. That's awesome. This has gotta be it. It looks... This is the place. Incredible. Yeah. Incredible. Don't you go in there, Andrea. Why? Because I don't believe the treasure is just sitting in there waiting for us. So let Jim and I... go in and check it out first, huh? Oh, come on, you guys. Be a good girl. Well, you better come back out after me. Whatever. All right. Be careful. Well, let's take a look here. Yeah. Got a couple of choices here. It's that way or that way. What do you think? Let's try that way? Yeah. Hey, Jim. Come here. What do you got? Look at this. I think we found somethin'. It's a booby trap. Huh. Come on. Just be careful. Oh, boy. Look what we found. Come on, Jim. Pay dirt. It's true. It's... It's real. It... We're rich, man. It's like a dream come true. Yeah. If we can only get it back to... to civilization with it. Ah. Come on. Let's get this outta here. Yeah, yeah. Okay. You push, I'll pull. Can you imagine the expression on Andie's face when she sees this? What did you stop for? I know all about you and Andrea. I've known about you two for a long time. Me and Andie? What the hell are you talkin' about? Nothing goin' on between me and Andie. There never was. You're a liar. Now you got a wife that loves you a lot, buddy boy, and the sad thing is you don't deserve it. You're in my way. Stu. Stu? For God's sake, Stuart. Help me. This whole place is collapsing. I take time to help you, I'll lose the chest. You're not gonna let me die. Are you crazy? Help me. Stuart! Jimmy! Where are you? Wait. Jimmy! Over my shoulders. There you go. Other one. Okay. Okay. Stuart? Stuart! Stu, are you all... Can't see. Move some of this. Get out of there. Are you all right? - Jimmy, are you all right? - I'm all right. I got you. I got you. Are you gonna be all right? Yeah. I think so. Hey, um, sorry. That's all right, buddy. That's all right. I'm sorry for everything. Yeah. Well, ladies and gentlemen. Here it is, another beautiful afternoon, and here we are at the final judging... for the Miss Fantasy Island beauty queen. And we have five lovely young ladies, but only one of our finalists can be picked to reign as queen of beauty. Now take a good look at them, everybody. You think you can choose which one it'll be? How about our judges? I wonder if they've been able to choose. Have you, judges? Are you ready? May I have the envelopes, please? Well, here they are. The queen and her court. And let me point out that in her court here... there will be three runners-up and not four. So our third runner-up is... Mary Ann Davis. Our second runner-up. A lovely choice, Miss Nina Connors. And now let's see what decision the judges have made on our first runner-up. Our first runner-up is... Miss Shirl Dean. Lovely young lady. And now the moment we've all been waiting for. The big moment. Who is going to be Miss Fantasy Isle? Who will be the queen of beauty? Who will be the most beautiful girl in the world? Here it is. Miss Elaine Benson. Yes, Elaine Benson is our queen. Put this here and crown you. Now there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. I'm so sorry. I know you must feel terrible. About the contest? Not really. Least not as much as you do. All those pictures, the publicity, your plans. Maybe if you hurry you can still sign up Elaine. Is that all you think I'm interested in? I don't know. I just know... I guess it was crazy for me to even ever try. I'll never be what Mother was. I know that, sweetheart. I know that now. And I loved your mother very much. But she's gone. I guess I was unable to face that until coming here. But I love you very much... For yourself. And if you give me a chance, I'd like to spend a great part of the rest of my life proving it to you. She'll probably ask for her money back. We failed, boss. Did we? Did we? I wanna thank you for everything. It was our pleasure. Say, um... How much was the treasure worth? Does it matter, Mr. Chambers? No. No, it doesn't. Not now. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Mr. Roarke. Your share of the Carvajal treasure. Thank you. You're most welcome. I don't get it, boss. They end up with nothing. On the contrary, Tattoo. They end up with a great deal. A very great deal. Well, you and your father seem happy now, Miss Quinn. I almost made a terrible mistake. Not as bad a mistake as I've been making. Thank you. Thank you both for the best fantasy of all... Reality. You know, boss, I like stories with a happy ending. It seems to me that today on Fantasy Island... more than one fantasy has had a happy ending. Thank God. Indeed.
