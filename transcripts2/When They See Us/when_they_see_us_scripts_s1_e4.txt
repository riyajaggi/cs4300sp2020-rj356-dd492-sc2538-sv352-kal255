Hey, I don't mind you, man. - Korey. - [man scoffs] I know. Everybody know. Seen the news and everything. [exhales] Crazy, man. Yeah. Crazy. So where'd they put the other four dudes that did the rape with you? We ain't do that. Shit. You know, I ain't mean it like that, man. I was just wondering, like, what happened. Well, they went to juvie. Somewhere, I don't even know. All I know is... I'm in here and they not. I hate it here. [man sighs] You can ask for a transfer. - A what? - A transfer. - You can do that? - Yeah. I mean, all you gotta do is just, like, write a letter.

You just write a letter? - Yeah. - [man whistles loudly] [man] Roll. - Get going. - [inmate] All right. See you later. - [man] Peace, bro. I'll get with you. - Yeah.

I said stop! Stop! [yelling indistinctly] Stop! Stop! Stop! [sobbing] Apply the anesthetic twice a day. Or you'll be back with an infection and I ain't got nothing much for that. They can't just do that. Maybe... I could talk to a guard or... or a warden? - Something? - And the next time I see you, you'll need way more than medicine. What am I supposed to do? Just let... let them do whatever they want to do? Whatever? The fuck am I supposed to say? [tearfully] I just need help. [crying silently] I helped you. I did my job. [menacing music playing] Now you're free to go. [whimpers] [man] Central Park. Let me know if you can do anything for me. It's a long way down. [indistinct chatter] How you doing? I'm surviving. You know, surviving. I was hoping I could see you before now. I've been trying. It is not easy getting all the way out here. - Okay, and there's a lot going on. - I know. - And it ain't easy... - It's all good. I just miss you. But you're here now. You're here now. Yeah. How you holding up? [scoffs] I've been better. Anything I can do? Anything. No, baby, there's... nothing you can do. Your brother been here to visit you? Which one? You know which one. The only one that would come. No. Marci ain't come. How is he? I wouldn't know. Maybe... Maybe he come with you next time you come. Maybe? You tell him I asked. You know that's not gonna happen. What about Yusef? I was thinking maybe you could have Yusef write? Imma have to work on that one. You know me and his mama ain't exactly the best of friends, but maybe they'll let him do it from his little boot camp. [sighs] What, um... What is it like for you in here? [Deloris] Hm? I don't know. Weird. You, um... You sure you're okay? Ain't nobody tried to hurt you in here, have they? [poignant music playing] [stammers] They said if I'm good, I can get off on parole. That'd be good. [Korey] I'm good, Mama. I'm good. [Deloris] Yeah. I know. [Korey] I'm sorry to ask, but can you put a little something extra on my commissary account? Mama, not much. Any little bit helps. Ten, twenty. Just... Just to add to my books. [tearfully] Boy, I ain't got nothing to give you. I ain't got it. [sniffs] But, um... I will work on that. I'll make it easier. I'll make it easier. I'll... [inhales deeply] I'll write up a transfer. I can get help from... from the library. I can write up a transfer and I'll make it easier. And you can come see me more. [sniffs] Okay. You cool?

They're not fucking with you. - Right? - Not today. - But they look a little hungry. - [officer] Next time, and there will probably be a next time, despite me looking out, ask for solitary. Don't go to the infirmary. Infirmary's for snitches. Keep 'em coming. And let me know what you need. [background music slows and distorts] [Korey] They went to juvie. Somewhere, I don't even know. All I know is... I'm in here and they not. [man] Hm. You can ask for a transfer. - [Korey] A what? You can do that? - [man] Yeah. I mean, all you gotta do is just, like, write a letter.

I could write up a transfer and I'll make it easier, and you can come see me more. I promise, Mama. [Korey] Y'all all together in juvie? [Raymond] How you been, man? [Korey] Holding it down.

[Korey taking shallow breaths] [Korey groans] [Korey groans in pain] [Korey whimpers] [wheezing] [tray clatters] [Kevin] The only reason that you got caught up in all of this... is 'cause you went down there to the station with him. - [Yusef banging on diner window] - [Yusef] Pollo! Let's go in the park. [Korey wheezes] I'll be fine. [Lederer] Did you skip school? On April 19th, 1989? [Galligan] You're here to answer questions. Answer the question. [Deloris] What is it like for you in here? A chin... a mouth... a nose... a forehead... back of the head... long hair... [woman] Hey, little bro. [laughs] Hey, Norman. What? Every time you make that face, it remind me of that time I caught you skipping school. Remember that? - [laughs] - Remember that? Yeah. Korey. [Korey sighs] - Hey, big bro. - Don't "Hey, big bro" me. - You're supposed to be in school, man. - I know, I know, I know. I... Give me some of these chips. [laughing] [Marci] I worry about you, Korey. Why? When you were a little kid, do you remember what you told me you wanted to be? - Yeah, I remember. - What? A police officer, [stammering] because I... I like the uniform. Most kids start out wanting to be a doctor or teacher, football player, police, whatever. But when they don't learn the discipline it takes, they end up doing a job they hate. Or worse, they end up on the street. You want to end up flipping burgers forever or begging people to let you sleep on their sofa? [Korey] No, I want a good life. Well, guess what? - Guess what? - What? You can do it. [man] Faggot. How come everybody always look at you like that? They're blind to beauty, baby boy. That's all. They're blind. So you been hearing me? You gonna do better? I promise. Shake on it. [Korey laughs] [adult Korey] I love you, big bro. I love you too, Korey. [unzips] [urinates] - [approaching footsteps] - [keys jangling] [door opens] [exhales nervously] Get cleaned up, okay? And, uh, get dressed. Chaplain wants to talk to you. How long I been in here, anyway? It's been a while, kid. Been a good while. We regret to inform you that your brother has passed away. Norman. [ethereal music playing] [chaplain] I'm afraid he was murdered last Tuesday. [Deloris] Get the fuck out of my house! [Marci] You think I wanna fucking be here? - I don't know where you wanna be! - What are you fighting about now? Your brother belongs in a crazy house. Your brother wants to be your sister. [Deloris laughs] Your fucking sister? You, boy... you're crazy. You're sick! - I'm leaving. Done. I'm leaving. - Why? Go on. Go. Mad 'cause I won't let him rip and run in and up out of here looking any old kind of way. Look at him! [laughs] You're a fucking joke. [poignant music playing] And everybody is laughing at you, in your face and behind your back. Korey, you know I ain't lying. But I'm done with it. I'm done losing businesses and friends and everything 'cause of your twisted ass. Go! This is my house, Norman. Marci! Okay? It's Marci! [chuckling] Fuck, you won't ever hear me call you that. Ever! Norman! - Norman, Norman, Norman! - [Korey] Mama! Mama, let's talk it out. Let's talk it out. It's not nothing to talk about. I'm done! You are a sad woman, Mama. Sad! [Deloris] Uh-uh. Don't you fix your mouth to tell me what I am. You don't know me. You don't know nothing about being me. 'Cause you got on my shit, you think you know me? What you know about being a mother? With no help. With nobody but yourself to depend on. You don't know shit. I know you're sad, Mama. And I know nobody made you that way. And I didn't make you sad, you did that to yourself! Miss me with the psychoanalysis, huh? You dealing out the fucking house! - Are you kidding me? - Shut up! You shut your filthy mouth, you demon. Like I said, a sad woman. At least I'm a real woman. [Deloris lights cigarette] I'll see you soon. Okay? Take care of yourself. Promise? Promise? [Korey] I promise. I promise. [sniffs] What about your stuff? [sniffs] Just take what you want. Get rid of everything else. I'm done with everything here. Except for you. [footsteps] [door opens and closes] Uh... I should call my moms. Make sure she okay. We're here to make sure that you're okay, Korey. - Me? - [chaplain] Yes, we are here for you. You're here for me. Uh, nah, I'll be here forever, sir. I'm not sure what you mean. - [chaplain] If there is anything... - I'm gonna be here forever, sir! - [chaplain] All right. - I don't know what you mean! [officer] All right, come on. Let's go, kid. - Come on. - Don't touch me! Don't touch me! You don't give a fuck about me! - [officer] All right... - Nobody give a fuck about me! Nobody gives a fuck about me!

With the goatee. My friend, the guard. You brought me a... a nice cool air conditioner? [Roberts] Nah, something better. [hatch opening] [Roberts] Brought you some stuff to read. That okay? [Korey] Yeah. Man, you could bring me a... a TV and Nintendo. [chuckles] Nah. Those, uh, video games are robbing the youth of their ambition. You stick to reading, all right? - I get any letters or phone calls? - [Roberts] I don't know, kid. You know what? Let me check, all right? Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. - [optimistic instrumental music playing] - [hatch closes] [Korey mimicking basketball commentary] Passes it back! He got three seconds! Three, two... He spins, shoots! [mimics basketball shot clock buzzer] But he was fouled! [groaning] [Roberts] You know how to play Solitaire? It's a card game. It's a game. You play it by yourself. [cards shuffling] There's, uh... I wrote up some instructions. [Korey] Thanks. Any phone calls, letters or...? [Roberts] Nothing yet, buddy. You been reading? Yeah, I been trying. It's interesting stuff. Chia seeds.

I'd want to know somebody's treating him like a human being. ["I'm So Into You" by SWV playing on TV] ["I'm So Into You" continuing] [breathing deeply] [whirring] [rapid whirring] - [gasps] - [air conditioner whirs] - [inmate 1] Oh, yeah! - [inmate 2] Oh, let it blow!

Just get some ice on it. [scoffs] [Roberts] And some ibuprofen. [groans in pain] [Korey] Honorable members of the parole board, thank you for seeing me. I never been in trouble in my whole life, ever. And when I get out, I don't plan on starting no trouble, 'cause I'm a good person. And I have no hard feelings for anybody or the situation. I just want to go home. Are you prepared to take full responsibility and admit to the crimes in which you've been found guilty? [ominous music playing] [woman] Mr. Wise, until you are ready to take responsibility for the crimes in which you've been convicted, this process cannot go further. [indistinct chatter] [exhales] Whoa! You look good. You look good. I do, don't I? [laughs] - [Deloris] Yeah. - You look... I, um... I gave my life to the Lord. After Marci, I... But, um... [chuckles] God saved me. He did that. - [serene music playing] - I miss you, Mama. - [officer] Wise! - I miss you too, baby. I miss you so much. - [officer] Don't do it, Wise! - You wanna give your life to the Lord? - Pray for me, okay? - [whistle blows] Okay, but listen... Let me pray for you. We all have sinned. Please come back as much as you can. - Please come back as much as... - Love your enemies, Korey! - Please come see me! Please, Mama! - [Deloris] Love your enemies! Hear what I'm telling you? Pray for your enemies! Bless those who curse you! - [yells indistinctly] - And those who persecute you! - Pray for those who persecute you! - I love you! They can't break you, Korey! - They can't break you, Korey! - They're gonna kill me! [Deloris] Korey, I love you! [Korey] Come see me more! Please, see me more! See me more! [Roberts] Come on. Floors ain't gonna mop themselves. There's no library here. How do I do a transfer? You want a transfer? [Korey] Yeah. I want to see my mom. She don't come here no more. It's hard for her. Look, kid... you can ask for a transfer, but it's a crapshoot. You might end up close, but you also might end up 25 minutes further away in Wende. No. No way. My bad luck been used up. [poignant music playing] [indistinct chatter] [reporter on TV] Now these are the first fire trucks arriving in Waco... a community that has been on the map in a way that it did not want to be necessarily. David Koresh of the Branch Davidians... [banging] [banging continues] [ominous music playing] [Korey yelling] - [Korey] Guard! Help! Guard! - [inmate] Fuck him up! [Korey] Guard! Guard!

You're not supposed to be in here. [officer] How long you figure he's out for? Full CBC. If this kid is able to walk and chew food without pain in a month, - we'll know he's on God's side. - [key turns in lock] [footsteps] [man] How you doing, Wise? Healing up, I see. [menacing music playing] Doc said it was gonna take divine intervention for you to be walking in a month, but... [inhales deeply] look at you now. A goddamn miracle. I have a confession. When I first heard the famous man from the Central Park Five thing was coming to Wende, I couldn't contain my excitement. [laughs] I couldn't wait to meet you. I even had a welcome committee ready for you. Anyway, now that I've had the pleasure, I want to let you know that we don't have stars here. We don't care how famous your case is or if you've been on TV. We don't take the uppity niggas in here. So, a lot of people don't feel you belong around here at all. You bring too much attention. With that said, Mr. Wise, you have the right to leave segregated confinement. You're not being forced to stay here. You do have a choice. I hope for your sake you make the right one. I'm staying here. [officer] Hm. [laughing] Wise choice. [laughs] Get it? [officer continues to laugh] [cell door closes] [door is locked] [Korey] I'm staying here. I'm staying here. I'm gonna stay. - I thought you wasn't hungry. - I'm hungry now. Okay, I said, "Baby, you hungry?" You said, "No, Korey." I know what I said, Korey. There you go, taking all my food. [man] Yo! Pollo! Let's go! We're going to the park! Come on, right now! Let's go, hurry up! - [woman] I thought you was hungry. - I better look out there. - No, Korey! For real, Korey? - [man] Let's go! Ain't got time for your love life, man! Let's go! Hurry up! I'm staying here. I'm staying here. [excited chatter and laughter] [banging on window continues] I'm staying. - For real? - Yeah. I'm staying. I'll get with you later. - [Yusef] Whatever, man. - Keep your head up. What? You fell in love, huh? [laughs] Now you're forgetting about your boys. - Aah! Aah! I can't hear you. Go! - [Yusef] Whatever, man. Peace out! [Korey] Yo, peace, baby boy! [woman chuckles] Wise choice. - [Korey] Hm. - Get it? - Korey Wise? - [laughs sarcastically] - [young Korey] Never heard that before. - Never heard that one before. [woman] Shut up. [both laughing] So... what's the plan? [inhales sharply] Oh, what's the plan? What's the plan? The plan is me and you, little lady. Whatever you wanna do. - [woman] Hm? - [Korey] Mm-hm. Like whatever-whatever? Like whatever-whatever. Whatever-whatever. [chuckles] Whatever-whatever, baby. [woman] Oh, shoot. Okay. [laughs] Um, so take me to, um... Coney Island. - [Korey] Yeah? - Mm. Your wish is my command. [both laughing] [woman] Come on, Korey. [hopeful music playing] Hi. Hi. [door unlocking] Let's go. - [Korey] Wait, for real? - Come on! - Baby, for real? For real? - Yeah! [both laughing] [woman] Faster! - [woman laughing] - Woohoo! [squeals with delight] Can I kiss you? [officer] Get up. Parole hearing. Can I get cleaned up first? [officer] What for? Just tuck in your shirt and wipe the boogers out your nose and let's get this over with. [woman] Mr. Wise, welcome back. Are you prepared to admit your guilt in the crimes of which you have been proven guilty? [exhales deeply] [pensive music playing] [cell door opens] - [Korey groans] - [officer] Oops. Guess you're gonna be staying with us for a while, huh? And they say justice is dead. Fifteen. [door buzzes] [cell door closes] [Korey] Fuck you! I hate this fucking prison! And everybody in it! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! [court clerk] In the matter of the State of New York v. Korey Wise... Fuck the cops! Fuck the police! Fuck the judges! You lied on me! You lied on me! To the count of assault in the first degree... - No! - [Korey] Fuck this whole goddamn house! - Get the fuck out of my house! - [court clerk] Guilty. You think I wanna fucking be here? - I don't want to be here! - [court clerk] To the count of assault... As to the count of sexual abuse in the first degree: guilty. - Mama! - [court clerk] Guilty! [Korey] I know you tried to be a good mom! I know you tried to be a good mom. [Deloris] Thank you for saying that. [sighs] Sometimes all you could do is try your best. I'm sorry... I wasn't what I should've been. [tearfully] I wanted to be... a lot of things. But I couldn't reach any of it. Drugs was easier. Ignoring you boys in real life... that was easier. But being scared for you... that gave me something to ask God for and mean it. Mm, don't cry, baby. Oh... I'm good, Mama. [Deloris sniffs] [Deloris sighs] It's all good. [exhales wearily] Roberts? Roberts, that you? You're gonna wanna see this, kid. [news anchor] Now, it may be that something fell off the building. It may be that something has fallen. We don't know, to be perfectly honest, but that is what you're looking at... You gotta stay awake. [anchor] That's the scene at this moment. Stay living, stay awake. We gotta live while we can, you know? [anchor] The whole side has collapsed? [reporter] The whole building has collapsed. [anchor] The whole building has collapsed? [reporter] The building has collapsed.

You're Korey Wise, right? Who wanna know? You don't remember me. Matias Reyes from Attica. Yeah. Attica. I remember. You still telling the world you're innocent? What's this about, man? [Reyes] Nothing. I just wanted to apologize for the... the TV thing in the day room and all that. It's all good. It's good. I ain't got no problem with you. [Reyes] Thank you. Your acceptance means a lot to me. Are you religious, Korey? Religious? That's what this is about? You trying to convert me? You have hope... and faith in you. And you held onto both. Good for you. He pulled me out of a discovery hearing, said it's urgent? - Ms. Ryan. - Mr. Morgenthau. A con named Matias Reyes requested an appointment with authorities in the facility where he is serving life for the rape and murder of Lourdes Gonzalez. She was pregnant at the time. He poked her eyes out with a butter knife. Her kids were in the next room listening. He's just admitted to brutalizing a jogger. It's the jogger case, Nancy. - Jogger case... - In the park. - Trisha Meili, 19... - 89. It's yours now. [Reyes] When I first saw her, I decided... I just decided to attack her. To... take everything that she had, to rape her. I followed her... "stalked her" I guess they call it. Did you beat her? Yes. Did you rape her? Yes. Did you leave her for dead? Yeah, I thought she was gonna die. [Reyes] There wasn't a lot of people out on that path. I saw her coming by... I saw her body... I run up behind her and hit her over the head, - but she wasn't unconscious yet. - [Meili groans] [Ryan] Did you use a weapon in the attack? [Reyes] There was a branch. It was pretty big. [man] "In the earliest hours of this whole thing, Fairstein acknowledged the track marks being where one person pulled in another. 'This is where he pulled her in, ' she said." Those clearly aren't the marks of five people. When did the theory change? I was there when it changed. I beat her with my fists. Then she was trying to run away, so I picked up a rock. [Meili yelling in panic] - Shut the fuck up! - [Meili screams] [Ryan] Was she conscious? [Reyes] Barely. It was like someone's nose is broken or something. Her blood is trickling out. It's a hard sound, like hard to breathe. [Reyes] She was making that sound when I left her there. - [Meili wheezing weakly] - [Reyes] It was cold. She was bad. I thought she was gonna die any minute, so I left. ["Tell It to My Heart" by Taylor Dayne playing quietly] ["Tell It to My Heart" playing through headphones] [Ryan] The real perp was walking through the park with her Walkman on, and drenched in blood. No cop looking for the other kids brings him in. You believe that? - That's what he's telling you. - Yeah, that's what he's telling us. Well... Are you telling me you really believe this guy's making it all up? Hey, you know what? Prison gets really boring. These people make shit up just for attention. Trisha Meili was violated in April 1989. That summer, you'll remember there were a series of rapes that terrorized the city. Four. Matias Reyes was arrested in August 1989. Confessed to those, straight out. That case and the jogger case shared the same judge, the same prosecutor, and the same detective: you. And... you never made the connection that the MOs were identical? No one even asked him about the jogger. If they had, he would have admitted that one too. Instead, you let the statement you got out of the five boys stand, even though they knew no details, no locations, even though the track marks didn't match, the timeline didn't match. - Nothing matched. - They gave statements that I believed were true. [man] You squeezed statements out of them after 42 hours of questioning and coercing, without food, bathroom breaks, withholding parental supervision. The Reid technique has been universally rejected. That's truth to you. I don't know what the fucking Reid technique is. - [laughs in disbelief] - Okay? I know what I was taught. I know what I was asked to do and I did it. Okay? They knew something. You don't confess to something you don't know about. They knew something. They put themselves there and they paid the price. And that guy that confessed, he's the sixth guy. Okay? We missed a guy. Okay? The fuck? Why do you think Wise and Matias Reyes had that squabble all those years ago? Why do you think that was? They were fighting over this. They were fighting over who's gonna take the fucking fall. And the only reason that Reyes is talking now is because he wants a better cell assignment. He wants the perks of attention, and you, sweetheart, are giving it to him. So don't let these animals fool you. Justice was fucking served. [Ryan] Is everything you told me today true? [Reyes] Yes. And for all of the events, as you've described them in detail from start to finish, were you alone? Yes. Were you aided by anyone? No. Was anyone with you in preparing for the attack in question? - No. - Was anyone with you in preparing - for the assault in question? - No. Was anyone with you during the assault in question? No. I did this. We all have to pay for our sins. I sinned, bad. I deserve to pay for mine. I deserve the time, I deserve anything that happens. [Reyes] That's me. Hook me up to machines, take my blood, whatever you need to do. I'm ready to pay for mine. [Reyes] You got somebody else paying for mine. Nobody else should be paying for mine. I'm certainly surprised by this invitation. [Ryan chuckling] I'm surprised to be making it. I'm here as a courtesy. Oh, courtesy is the last thing you're here for. You're here to gloat. But it doesn't matter. You've simply identified a sixth rapist. I always said there may be more. Yeah, you said that to cover because you knew you coerced those boys into saying what they did. They said what they said freely. They confessed. I actually think you've convinced yourself of that. It doesn't really matter what you think. There's a police commission report coming out in a matter of days that maintains that the five did it, and that Reyes is simply the one that got away. It's a 43-page report compiled by three lawyers named by the commissioner. It's the police department investigating itself. Linda... we pored over your confession tapes. We reconstructed the events of that night minute by minute. - I know what was done. - Oh, you know nothing. I know we have a DNA match on Reyes. His DNA was all over every article of clothing and physical sample we had of her. Under fingernails, where she fought him. The blood on her was from him. It was him. Only him. Well, that simply confirms that Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. Final Jeopardy. Likely To Die. Cold Hit. And the newest one... The Dead-House. While you were writing crime novels, Kevin, Antron, Yusef, Raymond, and Korey were serving time for crimes they didn't commit. I watched... while more than 30 detectives did a brilliant investigation. We got justice for a woman who was violated in the most gruesome way. We got justice for a woman who was used and thrown away like garbage. Those boys did that. We helped make sure they got what they deserved. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna lose a wink of sleep over it. And it's too bad you are. Thank you for buying the books. Enjoy. [keys jangling] [door unlocks] Let's go. Get yourself together. Come with me. Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Who died? [inaudible speech] Hello? Korey, it's Mama. Mama. Korey, can you hear me? It's Mama. Yeah, yeah, Mama. What's up? Somebody loves you. - What? - Somebody loves you, baby. You getting out! Mama, wait, wait, slow down. What are you talking about? Korey, listen to me. The man who did it, the man who actually did it confessed. He confessed. Oh, I been praying for this day. You free. You coming home. [Deloris cries] My baby coming... You coming home. No. [Nomsa] Betrayed by this city, these men were just boys when they were wrongfully accused and wrongfully convicted. - [man] Tron, you up? - Yeah, cuz, what's up? Yo, your lady up? She asleep, man, what's up? You heard the news, man? Yo, turn on the TV! [Nomsa] They were finally freed not because justice was pursued, but because somebody came forward to tell the truth. If the police had done their job at any point in these last 12 years, - if the prosecutors, - [woman] Kev! - [woman] Kevin! - if the press had done their job, not only would five young lives not have been destroyed, but many women would not have been subjected... - This about you, right? - ...to the violence by the actual rapist. [reporter] The District Attorney announced today - the men known as the Central Park Five - [cheering] will be exonerated of all crimes, based on eyewitness confessions. [Nomsa] The real criminal was free to rape, and even kill, while the police and prosecutors and puppets like Donald Trump patted themselves on their fat backs. [cheering and applause] But we didn't give up on these men. The community didn't give up, Reverend Al didn't give up, Congressman Perkins didn't give up, Michael Warren and all the attorneys didn't give up, my late husband Elombe Brath and I didn't give up, and these families... [cheering and applause] these families never gave up. [applause continues] We are so proud to welcome these men, we're so proud, [cheering] as they are finally awarded the proper settlement for their damages... as their records are cleared and they're fully exonerated for the lies told about them... as they step in fully forward into the light of their lives, despite what this city and this country has done to them and millions like them for generations. [applause] Now, Harlem, now you know how we do things, right? [cheering and applause] [Nomsa] Please, Harlem, help me. Help me, family. Help me give a warm welcome... [cheering and applause] Antron McCray... [cheering and applause] Kevin Richardson... [cheering and applause] - [inaudible speech] - Raymond Santana Jr... [cheering and applause] [inaudible speech] Yusef Salaam... [cheering and applause] Mama. [Nomsa] ...and Korey Wise. [cheering and applause] Hi, baby. [cheering] My baby! Yeah. [cheering] [poignant piano music playing] [woman] How come you always hungry? [Korey] How come you never hungry? [woman] 'Cause I eat at lunch. At school. - That's why. - [Korey] Mm. [woman] Mm! Look at me. [Korey] Well, now, I was waiting for you to get out of school so we could eat together. Everything better with you. Okay, I said, "Baby, you hungry?" You said, "No, Korey." [woman] I know what I said, Korey. [Korey] There you go, taking all my food. - [man] Hey, man. - [Korey] Yeah. I'll... I'll take some lunch, please. ♪ Moon River ♪ ♪ Wider than a mile ♪ ♪ I'm crossing you in style someday ♪ ♪ Oh, dream maker ♪ ♪ My heart breaker ♪ ♪ Wherever you're going ♪ ♪ I'm going that way ♪ ♪ Two drifters ♪ ♪ Off to see the world ♪ ♪ There's such a crazy world to see ♪ ♪ We're all chasing after all the same ♪ ♪ Chasing after our end ♪ ♪ Moon River ♪ ♪ Wider than a mile ♪ ♪ Crossing in style someday ♪ ♪ My dream maker ♪ ♪ Heart breaker ♪ ♪ Wherever you're going ♪ ♪ I'm going the same ♪ ♪ Two drifters ♪ ♪ Off to see the world ♪ ♪ There's such a crazy world you'll see ♪ ♪ We're all chasing after our end ♪ ♪ Chasing after our end ♪ ♪ Life's just around the bend ♪ ♪ My friend ♪ ♪ Moon River ♪ ♪ And me ♪ ["Picture Me Rollin'" by Nipsey Hussle playing] ♪ There's the will of the phoenix ♪ ♪ In your heart ♪ ♪ Wings outstretched ♪ ♪ Your head is raised to the sky ♪ ♪ Your time has come ♪ ♪ To take flight ♪ ♪ Singing a song filled with hope Of faith ♪ ♪ Casting the darkness behind it ♪ ♪ Mending a moment so we may witness ♪ ♪ Turning and feeling the soul ♪ ♪ Winding and turning, pushing, pulling ♪ ♪ Playing a steady profession ♪ ♪ Home in a moment Blink and it's over ♪ ♪ Turning and feeling the soul ♪ ♪ Singing a song filled with hope, Of faith ♪ ♪ Casting the darkness behind it ♪ ♪ Mending a moment so we may witness ♪ ♪ Turning and feeling the soul ♪ ♪ In your heart There's the will of the phoenix ♪ ♪ Head raised up to the sky ♪ ♪ Soaring from the remains of an ending ♪ ♪ With no reason to fly ♪ ♪ Fly, fly, fly ♪ ♪ Fly, fly ♪
