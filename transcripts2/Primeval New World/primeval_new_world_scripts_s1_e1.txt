 Evan Cross, a business mogul, uses his company's resources to research random anomalies. When bodies and missing people start increasing a single-manned government agency code named Project MAGNET and a member of Predator Control join the group. Connor Temple tries to warn Evan Cross about the dangers of the anomalies, but Cross has his own reasons for searching.

 Help! Help! It's right in front of us! Don't wait for me! We keep missing it. I'm slowing you down. No. No, we're in this together. Seriously, Cross. I'm getting too old to be chasing around in the woods. All we have to find is one and document it. It's going to happen. In which case, you're going to need somebody who can keep up. You've always kept up. I need a drink.

 Single malt? - I'm buying. - The hell you are. Evan! Why are you stopping? This is incredible. I've never seen anything like this. - It's a localised magnetic field. - Huh? - Evan! - Come on! This is trespassing. It's for lease. Aren't you even a little bit curious? No. - What the hell is that? - I have no idea. - Evan... - It's okay. Just wait here. Brooke! - Brooke! - Evan! We're thinking animal attack. What kind of animal is big enough to do that? I'll take some measurements after your team finishes up. Dylan, you are a life-saver. Three sugars. Soy milk is 60 cents extra now, just so you know. He's all yours. Hey. Male, mid-20s, body found Helms Plaza. Suspected animal attack. Right leg severed at patella. Left mid femur. Chest cavity torn open. Liver missing. As well as the heart, and most of the lungs. Worst mauling I've ever seen. It couldn't be a bear. Not this far downtown. Yeah, and bear attacks are usually territorial. Defensive. This is predatory. So, what are we thinking, cougar? Big cats tend to kill at the neck. That's the only thing that wasn't touched. He wasn't dragged here. There's no blood trail. Well, something happened to this guy. Maybe a jumper drifted off course? What, you think he was attacked in the air? He's got a parachute. Well, that would take an eagle the size of a pony. Let Detective Harlow handle this. - Detective. - Mmm. This has to be a murder, not an animal attack. Sorry, but I can only give you 7 out of 10 on that one. I do one reverse bunny hop, one time, and now you expect it every morning. That's because now I know what you're capable of. - Morning, Evan. - Morning, Wendy, morning, Dave. - Thanks. - Have a good day. You, too. Morning, Evan. Mac, you still enjoying your job here? Yeah, sure. It's all good. I mean, it's pretty quiet, but it covers beer and lift tickets, so I'm not complaining. In fact, I probably owe you a beer. Or 20. Why don't you come with me? Come on. How would you feel if we dialled things up a few notches? For what you've got me doing, I could handle more than a few. Good. Because I have a new assignment for you. I'll get back to that, but first, you can start by taking this call. Evan Cross's phone. Oh, hello, Ms Finch. Bad luck, I'm afraid. You just missed him. Ah. Perfect timing, he's back. - Evan. - Ange. I called you five times this morning. Six. Shouldn't you be guarding something? Mac's been promoted. To the Special Projects Group. Doing what? Special projects. The UmiGen meeting. Any chance you remembered? Dave Simmons, SVP of Innovation, UmiGen Technologies. Wife Katherine, daughter Avalon, I really don't know where they get these names from, spend their winters in Whistler, summers in Muskoka, and he has a $26 million contract with our name on it. And that was today, wasn't it? I knew you weren't ready, which is why I pushed the meeting till next week. And that is why I love you, Ange. You understand that inspiration takes time. I need you to focus that genius mind of yours on your business. I really like it when you handle all of that. Oh, hey, in the park last night, we got a blip, a big one. Evan. This pet project of yours has cannibalised every other R and D budget for too long. This is what the money's for. Yes, and if you keep going like this, you're not going to have any left because you won't have a company. I'm getting really close, all right? I know I am. And UmiGen? Evan, we need this contract. You can handle it, Ange. I mean, without you, my company... Would never have gotten off the ground in the first place. That, too. Toby Nance, Mac Rendell. Mac, Toby. Toby, Mac. Yeah, I've seen you at reception. Nice leathers. What is this place? Welcome to Special Projects. Mac's going to be our new field operative. What? What about Drake? We need someone full-time. That Anomaly in the park, it opened again last night. - That's three times in a week. - Mmm-hmm. But here's the weird part, it keeps on appearing in slightly different locations. We keep on missing it. So does that mean that I finally get to set up my local network? Because I think 30 magnetometers in a spoked array should do it. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, I'll clear the budget with Ange. Okay, you take Mac and you guys cover the west side of the park, I'll cover the east. Anybody have any questions? Uh, yeah. What's an Anomaly? It's a radiant magnetic event with a rapid rate of entropy, and it is harder to catch than a road runner. All right. Don't worry. I'll explain it to you when we find one. You coming? Wouldn't miss it. How is it? Too visible? - Kind of glinty. - Well, then grab me some dirt. And stop staring at my ass. Right. So 30 of these make a local network, for what exactly? It's a magnetometer array. It'll pinpoint any Anomaly that occurs in the park to within a metre. I don't get it. Why did you apply for this job if you don't really know what it is? I didn't. Cross gave it to me. - Out of the blue? - Pretty much. Same way he hired me in the first place. Why? Well, I guess there's more to you than meets the eye. I can promise you that. Oh, hello. Who are you? Sorry? Who are you? Oh, I'm here about the, you know... Internet. What about it? We had a report that it was slow. - Painfully. - Yeah, see? Yeah, we've actually had a few cases in the neighbourhood. Some strange electrical activity maybe. You know, I'll get a guy from security to give you access to the trunk room. Great. Actually, not great. I've left my crimper in the truck. It's a thing I need to use to fix the... It doesn't matter, but I'll grab that and meet your guy in the lobby? I'll let him know. Thanks. Happy to be of service. With the... Fixing the internet, from being slow. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't shoot, ranger. I'm not a bear. Sorry about that. - What are you doing? - I'm just collecting golf balls. Predator Control Team. You must know Tony Drake. We're old friends. Small forest. Dylan Weir. Of course. What's that supposed to mean? He's talked about you. Fondly. Evan Cross. He's never talked about you. Well, then he has his priorities right, then. So, you get a lot of predator action out here in Stanley Park, do you? Not usually. So something happened? - Some kind of attack? - I'm not at liberty to say. Well, that's a yes. You seen anything unusual in the area? No, not a thing. Did you bring friends? Not 8-foot-tall ones. We should go. Slowly. I need to call this in, get you to safety. I'll get a full team over here. Or maybe just Drake, all right? There's some kind of interference. It's a magnetic spike. Mr Cross, stop! What the hell is that? Is there any heat coming off it? Negligible rad output. Ambient surface temp. Magnetic signature steady. Is it dangerous? Yeah. Stay close to me. Looks like claw marks. Evan, don't move. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We have to go. What the hell's going on? I don't know. - But we went through it. - To where? I'm not sure. Can you explain any of this? I'm working on it. - What do you mean you're working on it? - Just come with me. Unbelievable. Hey, don't touch that. 35 mil? Really? Digital tech's unpredictable around large-scale magnetic events. Uh, "large-scale magnetic event"? It was a doorway. To somewhere. Yeah, it's a closed-curve temperospatial intersection. Whoa! You finally track down a magnetic Anomaly, and it spits out dinosaurs. That big fellow right there, that's a Utahraptor. Jesus. I'm going to guess that's pretty cool. It's cool, and it's dangerous, Toby. Let's not forget that. - Right. - So where's the raptor now? The Anomaly closed before it could follow us. Hey. I just got your text. Want to get me up to speed? And who is this? Dylan Weir. Predator Control Team. Angelika Finch, CFO, Cross Photonics. Ange. They're real. They're real. And you never doubted me. No wonder you never stopped looking. Being on the other side, it was scary as all hell, but unbelievable. I'm finally starting to get some answers here. Whoa. "Starting"? Evan, I thought this was the answer. So you've seen these before? Kind of. Wait, you knew these were time-portals all along? No, I didn't know anything, and I still don't, but I promise you guys, I'm going to figure it out. Okay, hang on, Evan. There are not enough lawyers on the planet to be able to cover the liability involved here. We have to report this to the proper authorities. Really? And who are the proper authorities, Ange? Nobody is qualified to deal with this. She's right. I have to call this in. Okay. Who do you want to call? Tony Drake? You know, that's a good idea. He's going to want to talk to you. Drake, it's Evan. Yeah, I'm here with Dylan Weir. She knows. All right. Go ahead. Drake? Why didn't you tell me? Would you have believed it? Even coming from me? But we saw them. They're real. We saw... We saw dinosaurs. I've been following fresh tracks since this morning. Tell Evan I think I've found it. He says he's tracking something right now. Drake, where are you? Near Bute Plaza. SkyTrain service tunnel. Okay, we'll be there in 10. Don't go without us. - Let's roll. - I'm coming with you. - Can you go any faster? - I could on my bike. What do you think it is that he's found? I hope it's nothing. Hey. Hey. It's Drake. Yeah, we're on our way. I found another body. It killed again. Looks recent. - I thought we left it on the other side. - So did I. Does this mean there could be another one? - Where are you? - Utility corridor, third level. Drake, get out of there right away. Do what he says. Get out of there. Drake? Drake! Drake? Drake, hey, talk to me! Drake, answer me! Tony, please... Dylan... You want me to get someone else? No. No, no, I'm okay. Um... Deep lacerations to the left ribcage. Left arm severed at the elbow. Mr Cross? Do you have a minute? - Who are you? - Honestly, it's probably better if you don't know that. Do you recognise this little beauty? - It's mine. - Hmm? Not yet, it's not. How did you get that? Mr Cross, you're an intelligent man, so I'm hoping you're going to listen to my advice. Just leave it alone. You think you're rewriting the laws of physics, right? Making the world a better place? I understand, I do, but the stuff that you're messing with is unbelievably powerful. That means other people are going to want a piece of it, and trust me, that has a way of ending badly. Okay. Okay... Slow down and start from the beginning. What causes the Anomalies? How do I stop them? You can't. They're a force of nature. You'll just end up making things worse if you... If you don't leave them alone. I can't do that. Well, yeah, you can. Forget everything I've seen? Somebody needs to deal with these creatures. No argument there. But the Anomalies, they're, you know, Kryptonite. Okay. Well, help me. I can't. Listen, I'm breaking the Official Secrets Act by even talking to you at all. - Secrets Act? - Mmm-hmm. People are dead. My best friend's one of them. I know, and I'm sorry. But if you go telling people there's dinosaurs down the road, then you're going to create mass panic. Then you're going to get tourists, and that means you're going to get more bodies. Not cool. - "Not cool"? - No. Yeah, you're going to have to give me more than that. The creatures are the loose threads. You pull the wrong one, history unravels. So you just have to put everything back where it came from. You understand? Understand, um... You say that like it's so easy. Oh, no, it's not easy, not even a little bit. Good luck. That's not enough. It'll have to be. Who was that? Good question. Evan. The wounds on these bodies, tooth pattern's consistent with the raptor we saw. Which means there's another one on the loose, then. That's not it. The first victim, the parachute guy? No tooth marks there. His eyes were pecked out. Chest ripped open, organs consumed. Typical of a bird of prey. An impossibly large one. All right, so it's not a raptor. That means something else is out there. Something that flies. Weir. We've got another possible attack in the park. A kid's missing. - You coming? - Yeah. Tell Toby to meet us over there. I think I know where to find these things. Rita! It's Ange. Too long, I know. There's been so many cuts in Defence, I was worried you wouldn't be there. Hey, so, listen, I was wondering if you might be able to point me in the right direction. Don't laugh, but... Yes, sir, I understand that, but is there a department that handles unexplained phenomenon, UFOs, that sort of thing? You probably think I've been listening to too much late-night AM radio. But I promise you, no tinfoil hat. Yes. No, it's not little green men. I've never seen a single episode of Star Trek, so you can wipe that smirk off your voice. Surely, there has got to be someone in the government charged with handling this sort of thing. Anyone? Hello? Angelika Finch. Command told me to expect you. You're Lieutenant Kenneth Leeds? That's affirmative. And this is the headquarters for "Project Magnet"? Yes, ma'am. Is this a joke? - Pardon? - Because I got to tell you, on the drive over here, this was my worst nightmare of what this place would be like. Some forgotten government agency sucking away my tax dollars to carry out goat-staring experiments. Let me explain. Project Magnet formed December 2, 1950. Mission, classified. August 1954, achieved mission success, also classified. Now, two days later, Magnet was publicly shuttered, but it has remained operational at above top secret level, ever since. Without redecorating. I am actually very excited to meet you. That one's empty. Um... I've been keeping a file on Evan Cross for several years now. What? He's a fascinating guy, anyway, but he popped up on my radar when he started buying certain kinds of electronics five years ago. So I pulled Cross Photonics' tax returns. Wait, our tax returns? Government. $10 million in unspecified R and D. He's found it, hasn't he, what he was looking for? I think I've made a mistake. Oh, no, Ms Finch, Magnet has full authority to help you deal with your alien threat. They're... They're dinosaurs. Noted. Um, look, I know what you're thinking, that you have reached the bottom of your particular barrel, but if the powers that be have shoved you this far down the rabbit hole, you are likely out of options. So think of me as the light at the end of your tunnel. The last port in your personal storm of hopelessness and despair. I am ready, willing, and able to help Evan Cross kick some alien ass. Prehistoric ass. Even better. Is the kid still missing? Yeah. Name's Trevor Molison. I'm allowed access, but the rest of you, no. They think a bear is responsible for the attacks, and it's still in the park. - But it's not a bear. - And 50 police officers are about to walk into two lethal predators. Okay, let me make a call. Hey, it's me. Look, I don't have a lot of time to explain. Can you work some of those high-level contacts of yours for me? I kind of need through a police cordon. And you think that's something I can get done? Yeah, I mean, there isn't anything you can't, right? Leave it with me. Okay, so, full access to the park, and a cover story for the police. And do you want the reporters called off by their editors or do you want me to have them locked up? You know what, I'll just go with having them called off. Okay. Uh... Uh, um... Yes? This is "The Weatherman," and I would like to report a "stormfront." Affirmative. Outstanding. Okay, thanks. Looks like your friends got clearance to help with the search. How did that happen? Ask my friends. Well, keep us in the loop, will you? Yeah. Good to go. Where'd you get those? From the back of Drake's car. He would have wanted us to have them. All right. Single shot. So what's your idea on where we're going to find these things? They called the first victim "parachute guy," right? Yeah, he was a base jumper. I found parachute nylon in this clearing where we met. I didn't know the significance then, but... It could be a nest. I really appreciate your help. I'm not doing this for you. Evan, I've got something. Is the Anomaly back? No, but we're getting some interference. A weak radio signal on 15, and it isn't the police frequency. I'm on it. Hello? Hello! Trevor? Yes. Can you get my dad? Yeah, sure I can, bud. But first, where are you? - I'm lost. - Not for long, pal. Look around. Tell me what you see. I see the monster. We're getting close. Trevor! Trevor, talk to me! Mac, the boy is somewhere near the nest. Almost there! Trevor, we're coming to you. Trevor, are you there? Trevor? I'm at the clearing. I see the one with the wings. Do you see the boy there? Yeah, but he's right under Big Bird. Scared, but alive. Mac, we're here. We're going to tranq it. Is that a hit? Yeah, but I don't know its metabolism. Or its body mass. It could take a few minutes to have an effect. Yeah, we don't have time for that. No, you can't... Hey, over here, pecker-face! Hey, big-nose! Hey. Hey. I got you. I got you, buddy, you're okay. It's all right, bud. Evan! It's all right. It's all right, Trev. I mean, I thought Evan was done for, the kid, too. But then big-nose here comes back from the dead and slams his beak right into Toothy McBiterson! Her beak. It was a female. How do you know that? - She was making a nest. - To lay eggs? Well, not any more. These things don't belong in our skies. So if we're not going public, then why are we freezing them? I'm not sure we have a choice. They're too important to destroy, and until we have a chance to put them back where they belong, I think we're stuck with them. Well, we'd better make sure no one comes poking around, then. Well, this part of the building is off the map, and I'd like to keep it that way. Right. Come on, new guy, I'm going to show you how to use our super-secret coffeemaker. And clear a desk for me? Yeah, we'll see about that. You coming? Yeah, in a minute. Evan! What the hell is that? It's okay. Just wait here. Evan!
