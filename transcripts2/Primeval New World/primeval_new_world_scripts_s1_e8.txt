 Primeval: New World (2012â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 8 - Truth - full transcript 
 A PACHYCEPHELOSAURUS is rampaging through the glass-and-steel Olympic Village, leaving a trail of destruction. As Evan and the team search for the creature and the Anomaly, they are surprised to find KEN LEEDS on the site, with a military team in tow. Project Magnet is back to full operational strength and Leeds is eager to be more involved. Back at Cross Photonics, Evan and his team face a new problem when Evan discovers that the ALBERTOSAURUS that killed his wife has returned. The creature is a smaller, faster, nastier version of a TYRANNOSAURUS, and facing it in the same building where Brooke died brings Evan face-to-face with his worst demons.

 Look behind you! Behind you! Look behind you! Turn around! Holy shit! Wouldn't want to be going up against you. Yeah? Not much chance of that. If your boardroom buddies could see you now. They would cower in fear. I should head back upstairs. Here. Thanks.

 Evan, we're... We're at work. All right, well, I'll talk to the boss. Somebody could walk in. If that's what you're worried about, just say the word, and I'll institute emergency lockdown protocols. No one'll be walking in. I've got this place wired. I bet you do. All right, I'll tell you what, I'll take a rain cheque. Tonight, let's go out for a real dinner. Away from the office. Deal. Anomaly! Anomaly! Duty calls.

 Yeah. Tonight. We're not animals, we're people. I don't acknowledge the distinction. There's distinctions between us. Opposable thumbs. Apes. All right, higher brain function. Language. Dolphins. Parrots. Whales? You're not going to win. Oh, but I could if I was arguing with a parrot. Evan... No, wait. This is one that I've studied. Pachycephalosaurus. I remember that head bone. It's a herbivore. It's not attacking. It's just curious. You trust these things too much. Any bodies? So far only busybodies. We've got to get this thing under wraps. Dylan says it's a herbivore, but it sure looks like it has a habit of smashing windows. Reminds me of me at sixteen. We'll track it down while you find the Anomaly. I've got a better idea. Why don't you go and find the Anomaly, and I'll take Dylan and go and catch the beastie? Okay. Yeah. You take the lead on this one. No worries, everyone! - Predator Control on the case! - You have to stop doing that. Why, are you afraid you'll get fired again? - They didn't fire me, I quit. - That must've been satisfying. Whoa. We need to get closer for a shot. Why is it just standing there? It's the reflection. It's seeing itself and thinks it's a rival. There it goes! Mac? The Anomaly's in a locked building. That thing must have hit a crash bar to get out. Might need your help back at this end. Drop your weapon! Relax, it's just a tranquillizer gun. Turn around. Keep your hands visible. You do a lot of animal hunting in the city, sir? Technically, tranq guns aren't even covered by the Firearms Act, are they? Technically, I think we might have to take you back to the station for further questioning. That won't be necessary. I'll need to ask you to clear the area, officers. I'll be taking over this investigation. Well, aren't you Johnny on the spot? You're welcome. I've also got window repairmen on the way, and I've put a call in to The Enquirer offering them exclusive coverage. I expect that to scare away the mainstream media. You know, I could've been here sooner if you'd called, or if you'd see fit to loop me into your Anomaly detector alert. Now, fortunately, I scan the police band and a number of talk radio shows. Anyways, here I am. I see that. And you brought friends. Yeah, I've received full allocation of resources. Project Magnet is up and running at full strength. Well, we're still staffing up, but we're getting there. Do your people have the creature under control? - We're working on it. - And the Anomaly? Why don't you just handle the witnesses, and we'll handle the rest? Mr Cross, we need to trust each other if we're to achieve full operational coordination. Lieutenant, I appreciate the help that you've given us - in guarding the open Anomalies... - Then let me help you with everything else. Evan! - Go ahead, Mac. - Meet us at the entrance to the park. - We've got it. - Yeah, I'll be right there. You want to help? Get your guys to set up a perimeter on this building. You heard that. Lieutenant, nice to see you again. Thank you. Let's get this wrapped up. It's okay. You're going home now. The creature's a ruminant. It's just vegetable matter and water. Prehistoric puke? Hey, at least it didn't come out the other end. We're going to need a hoist to truck it to the Anomaly. I'll take care of everything. Yeah, and we'll stay here to make sure you take care of everything. Really, that isn't necessary. Why don't I stay here and help soldier boy clean up, and you go take a shower? Not the worst idea. All right. Fine. Toby, come on, we need to get out of here. The audible alarm is on a three-two pulse, and that is a gas leak. There's no pressure loss in the underground tanks, and there's no halon discharge. - I think this is a phantom alarm. - We should clear out till we're sure. - Where's Evan? - He headed for the showers. - He's probably out of the building by now. - Like we should be. Okay, fine. Let me just take the tablet so I can at least run diagnostics outside. Oh! You know what? I should also grab the Mark Twos, because those are hard to replace. Can we please go? Good, you're still here. So we're not bugging out? False alarm. - Wait, you triggered it? - I needed to clear the building. So there's no gas leak. - What happened? - Albertosaurus. Like the one that killed your wife. The same one. Holy crap. You're sure? You think I could forget it? Evan, how is that even possible? You secured that area when we bought the building. But I didn't even get an Anomaly alert. What? How up to date is your data? Local? Under sixty seconds. And it shows nothing. Must be a cancellation effect. - I guess that's possible. - Then let's recalibrate for that. Okay. I could do that. Probably. Lockout. - Okay, we're in lockdown. - Is the building clear? Except for us. There's no sign of a monster. That's because it's down on Level A. Which you won't find on any of your maps. That room is reinforced. Key card in both directions. Nothing could get in or out of there. But you think something did. Evan, are you okay to do this? Yeah. I need you two to stay here. - Evan, I'm not... - Please. I'm going to lock down the Tank on the way out so I know you're safe. Let's go. No tracks, no sign of damage. How tall is it? Five meters? Maybe six? It's big. Nothing's disturbed. I didn't think Tyrannosaurids had a stealth mode. Whatever you do, don't let your guard down. It'll come out of nowhere. I won't be able to stop it. Evan, okay, come on, let's do this the right way. If you don't have my back on this, maybe you should just go. That's not what I meant. But you're playing on tilt. You need to tell me what's really happening here. What's happening? We're on the trail of the monster that killed my wife! Sorry. I just wanted to solve some stupid puzzle... Hang on. I just want to check this out. There's a structured magnetic element here with a remnant field that is off the chart. And Brooke just wanted to go home. This is trespassing. Evan, please, let's just get out of here. - What the hell is that? - I have no idea. Just wait here. I didn't get to her in time. I couldn't stop it. And then they told me it didn't happen. The doctors told me it was just a coping mechanism to live with her death. But it was real. Even if no one believed it. It was real. This is the room where the Anomaly was. No one but me has been in here in six years. How often do you come down here? Why do that to yourself? Why move in here at all? What else was I supposed to do? Let someone else walk into the same meat grinder we did? There's no Anomaly. No new damage. There must be another Anomaly. Somewhere else in the building. That Toby doesn't know about. Well, maybe she's missing something... Get down! It's right behind you! Evan, stop! There's nothing there. - Get back! - Evan, there's no dinosaur. You're insane. You could have gotten us both killed. Evan, listen, you're not thinking straight. Something happened to you. Are you going to try to tell me that I didn't see what I just saw? That thing killed Brooke and now it's back for the rest of us. Evan... Hey! Hey, come on. Wait! Evan! Whoa! Evan, stop! Shit. What are you doing, Evan? I'm still trying to figure out what Evan did to the main door. But if you want, I can crack open the upstairs door for you. I'm on my way. Are you sure that it's safe to open? There's no Tyrannosaurus Lite that's going to come tearing through here? No, Toby, it's fine. There is no dinosaur. This has to be from the slime that creature got on him. Could be a prehistoric defence mechanism. How could that make him see an Albertosaurus that isn't there? Natural hallucinogenic in its diet, maybe? Gets in his bloodstream, starts bringing out traumatic stress. You saw how amped up he was, sweaty, dilated pupils. At first I thought it was just the adrenaline. Now I think he got dosed. The question is, is he going to be okay? I wish I knew. A lot of natural psychotropics wear off in minutes or hours. But nightshade, for example, gets you high and then shuts down your lungs and kidneys. Stop it! That's not going to happen. We need to get him to a doctor. Agreed. This will be safe for a human metabolism. You want to use that on Evan? It's that or take him down with a dino tranq. He needs our help, before he hurts himself. Or someone else. This is the best way. And grab a tranq rifle. Just in case. Toby, can you see where he is right now? Yeah, I get lockdown info in real time. See? There. He's created a perimeter around that old cold room. Can you bring up the security cams for that level? See if he's all right? No, they're on a pass code, like the one that he used to censor the floor plan. Maybe even the same one. Damn it, I wish I had a key logger on this machine. It was six digits. First three were 0-5-2. 0-5-2-0-8-0. It's Brooke's birthday. Oh! See? There. He's on the move. Looks like he's tracking something. Or thinks he is. Let's go, Ange. Lock that upstairs door behind us. And let Mac know what's going on. Lockdown. Honey, this is trespassing and breaking and entering, and at least one more jailable offence. Maybe this place is like a top-secret lab or something. It's for lease. If anybody asks, we're just checking it out. Evan, please, let's just get out of here. Love, no. Nothing that I know of can create a stable, focused magnetic effect like this. - I mean, aren't you even a little bit curious? - No. Brooke, go back. Stop! Don't go down there! Don't! Evan? Are you okay? How did you get past lockdown? Override code. I'm just getting some stuff. What are you doing? Going after a killer. I need a real weapon. That's not how we do it. I'm not going to let that thing kill again. I should get Dylan. Dylan's not going to help. She thinks I'm crazy. But you don't think that, do you, Toby, huh? No! No. I know you're not. Evan, it's just, you might just be seeing the world differently, that's all. So... Maybe you could just try taking it easy. I'm not going to take it easy. I'm not going to rest until that thing is taken down. Well, then, maybe you need some help. I mean, I could always call backup for you. Toby, you don't want to be turning against me right now. You need to just leave everything to me. Evan! It's for your own safety. I'm locking that door behind me. You stay in here till I come back. Dylan, do you think that he... - He's going to be okay. - You can't know that. And I can't get my job done if I start thinking like that. Okay. It's Evan, remember? He does the impossible for a living. It's Mac. He's locked out. Tell him to meet us in the lobby. I have a bypass code. - Hey. - Hey. So while I've been playing "Who's a Big Boy Now?" with the Lieutenant, Evan's been running around the building chasing imaginary dinosaurs? - Yeah. - Right, let's go find him. Let's see if Toby's got an updated location. - Toby? - Mac? - Evan? - Great. I need your help. Sure thing, boss. Where are you? By the Anomaly. There is no Anomaly. Where's that? Who's there with you? Is that Dylan? Don't listen to her, Mac, she's going to get you killed. We want to help you, Evan. Well, then, you need to believe me. I do believe you, mate. Tell us where you are. Look, you guys just get somewhere safe. I'll handle the Albertosaurus. Evan... I'm right under it. I gotta to go. He said he was at the Anomaly. Do you think he went back to that room? It's down on the secure level. The one next to the dinosaur freezer? Here. Better take this. Evan's not going to trust me, but maybe you can get through to him. What happened to Toby? How did he get her phone? We're going to make sure that Toby's okay. Damn it! Evan! Stuff this. There we go. Whoa! Dylan's not with you? No, she doesn't believe you. I do. Come on. That thing's here. The one you were chasing. The one that puked on you? It's been tranq'd and sent home. The Albertosaurus! Mac... Brooke's dead. Yeah, I know. You saved me from that thing, and now we have the chance to save everyone else. I saved you from the Albertosaurus? You were hurt, badly. I knew you were dying. - Evan, that never happened. - I saw it. I watched you die. And then I had to hide your body before anyone else found out. What are you talking about? Mac, you saved my life. But you were too late to save Brooke. Evan, there's a body in here. I know. Who the hell is in there? What the hell? That's me. - Jesus, Evan! - had to hide you. No. You're supposed to stay in the box. Get the hell off me. Look out! Why? It's not supposed to be here. - Let me get help. - It's too late. Put me back. Put everything back. Into the Anomaly. What is that? Doorway. Home. Let me get help. You're going to die. Not here. I need to go home. Please. Please. I'd better get you back through the Anomaly. There is no Anomaly! There's nothing there! It's gone. Too late. We're too late. Evan! Evan! Locked. System's down. Toby! You okay? No, I'm not! Evan shot my server! He's using live ammunition? Toby, can you get out? I'm working on it! I just need a little bit of power. Ta-da! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. But now we have other problems. Somebody shut down the audible evac alarm, right? Except that now I see a gas leak, and it's not a false alarm this time. Okay, where is it? The lines run through the utility tunnels underneath the entire building. Okay, time to get out, for real this time. Not without Evan. Mac went to find him. Yeah, but nobody's heard from him. And I keep getting a patchy feed, because I think Evan keeps shutting down the junctions. Those relay boxes are in the utility tunnels, too. Oh, crap. That room is refrigerated. I have to get him out of there. - We have to find Evan. - I know. We will. Mac! Mac! - Mac! - I'm here. Are you okay? No. - I really need to get out of here. - I'm working on it! Please hurry. I'm trying, Mac. No! Brooke! No! I was so close. What the hell? Mac, is that you? Yeah. But how are there two of you? Ask Evan. You know, I was going to join the army. Seemed like the only way to get off the estate. But then Evan showed up with a better offer. And then that guy, the army guy I was supposed to be, got erased. That's the real Mac Rendell. No. No. No, Evan wouldn't do that. All I know is everything he ever told me, right from the beginning, it was all a lie. Let's go. - I'm starting to smell gas. - It's not too bad yet. I should have known things were going too well. This isn't Evan. Whatever he's doing, it makes sense in his head. He needs to finish it. If we're going to get through to him, I think we'll just have to play along. Sounds like the voice of experience. I've been to this rodeo a time or two. The insulation's stripped off these. Put current through them, you could get a pretty good spark, once the gas builds up in here. We're right below the cold room. That's where Evan thinks the dinosaur is. - If he sets this off... - He'll take out this whole end of the building. There's an emergency vent system down here. It's by the east stairs. I'll get it. We need to find the rest of these detonation points and disable them before Evan tries to set them off. Evan! You're here. I'm so glad you're safe. Evan, what are you building? This is the only way to kill it and bury that Anomaly forever. You can't do this. People will die, okay? You will die. I can't let it hurt anyone else. This isn't the way. Please, just let me help you, okay? Let me get you to a doctor. I'm doing this for you. So that thing can't kill you again. Again? Of course. That's why you were so happy to see me. You don't see me. I love you. - That's why I have to do this. - No. You have to stop. That's the only way to save me. That thing killed you. I watched it kill you. I couldn't stop it. I know. I know you couldn't. No one could have. You don't have to spend the rest of your life making up for something that wasn't your fault. You can let me go. I don't want to let you go. The only thing I want is to be with you again. Then, Evan, please, just give me your hand. Please. I love you. I will always love you. Ange? Is everything okay? Let's get him out of here. Ange? He thought I was Brooke. At least he got to say goodbye. Ange, don't walk away like this. It's okay. You can tell him I'm not angry. And I'm not staying. Lot of ghosts in here. What did the doctor say? Well, whatever was in that slime, apparently, it won't have any lasting ill effects. Except for screwing up my life and ruining all my friendships. Yeah, I called Mac. He's not answering. What happened, Evan? How did you wind up with this? This is what happens when you don't put everything from the Anomalies back where they came from. The whole world can change. I thought it was a miracle, you know that? I went to England looking for the family of the guy who saved my life. All I knew was his name. Mac Rendell. And when I knocked on the door, he answered. But he was a 19-year-old delinquent, not a soldier. Why didn't you tell him the truth right then? That he was a time traveller, and I had his future self's body stashed in my freezer back home? That would have been a hit. He saved my life. I just wanted to return the favour. I didn't think it would end up like this. I don't blame him for walking out. Or Ange. I really screwed this up. You know, I... I never wanted to be here. I just wanted my old life back, doing what I do best. Before dinosaurs, before Anomalies. Oh, I know. And then you know what happened? I changed my mind. I made a choice and I'm not looking back. You're not in this alone. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
