 Primeval: New World (2012â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 12 - The Sound of Thunder - Pt. 1 - full transcript 
 When TOBY is stung by a BRONTOSCORPIO, EVAN turns to ANGE - and Project Magnet scientist MARA FRIDKIN - for help. To save Toby's life, EVAN and DYLAN are forced to enter the Anomaly to retrieve a venom sample. MAC stays by Toby's side as her condition worsens at an alarming pace and doctors at Project Magnet struggle to keep her alive. On the other side of the Anomaly, Evan and Dylan discover an ANOMALY JUNCTION - hundreds of Anomalies leading to hundreds of times and places. Including one leading to Evan's own past - and a terrible temptation. With Evan and Dylan stranded in the past, Toby's life hangs in the balance.

 You guys aren't messin' around, huh? Well, if you can't stand the heat... Oh. Okay. That's how it is. All right, let's go! Let's put them out of their misery. Let's go! Here we go! You're a dangerous woman. Okay, give me love. That was awesome.

 You're so good. Thanks. Cece, hold up a second. You're not going to make me wait till next game to see you again, are you? You're cute, but I'm seeing someone. Of course you are. Look at you. How serious is it? You don't like to lose, do you? No, I don't. Neither do I. Okay. Oh, God.

 See you later, Skyler. Good luck with that. I could've worked with that. Primeval New World 01x12 The Sound of Thunder, Part 1 Original Air Date February 12, 2013 ==sync, correction by dcdah== for addic7ed.com You've been at ground zero on this from the start. Unlike Cross, you understand that this isn't something that can managed by a team of renegades. You may not agree with his approach, but you can't deny it's been effective. They've been lucky, but they won't always be, which is why this new civilian alliance with Project Magnet needs to be as tightly managed as the military operation. I want the best people working for me. That's why I am starting with you. And why I am starting with Evan Cross. First priority is the anomaly detection tech. Despite what he may have told you, that might not be so easy. Well, he offered full cooperation. I know Evan. He doesn't respond well to threats. Is that right? Well, what is it that you think he would respond to? Me. Isn't that why you hired me? That is exactly why I hired you. I think this is the most important project you and I will ever be involved with. The potential benefits are almost limitless. So is the potential damage. Ms. Finch, I live by a very simple philosophy, "leave the world a better place than you found it." That is what I plan to do. Well, then, we'd better get started. Agreed. You let me know if you need anything. Actually, there is one thing. Ms. Finch. What brings you here? Colonel Hall has asked me to take over the management of Project Magnet. Ah. Are you going to do it? With your help. Well... I'm not sure how much help I can be from in here. The colonel has agreed to expunge your record and restore your rank. It's the best I could do. You did that for me? Of course. Well, uh... Well, then, um, Lieutenant Kenneth Leeds, reporting for duty. There you are. Where have you been? Setting up that anomaly detector. It's not a plug 'n play, you know. I don't even want to know where it is. But please promise me that Hall will never find it. Not a chance. And as soon as the remote telemetry re-calibrates, we're up and running. Yeah, no need to thank me. Thank you. Now we can get you back to work on the new handheld. Ooh, I am way ahead of you. I started working on it while the anomaly detection software recompiled. Why didn't you tell me? Because Dylan said the best way to deal with an angry animal is to steer clear. I'm not angry, Toby. You know what, if I had an obsessive colonel threatening to lock me up, I'd probably be pretty tense too. But I have something that's going to cheer you up. It's the prototype. To the mark three that you designed? It's tricked out with a biometric lock to stop any unauthorized use. But the big leap is that anomaly timer. What? What's... Is something wrong? Did I do something wrong? No, it's just... It's not what I was expecting. Well, I mean, I had to mod the case for the bigger screen and the upgraded components, but, you know, if you want, I can change it? No. You know what, it looks exactly like it should. Awesome. So now all we need is an anomaly to test it on... Cross. I'll be right there. I don't get it. They could be studying T-Rexes, and they're analyzing algae. Evan says one of Hall's ideas is to bio-engineer this stuff in the past and make cleaner oil in the present. Could that actually work? Even if you could do it, messing with the past is the ultimate bad idea. He can't do anything if he can't find the anomalies. Well, that's not gonna happen. So... I had some time to kill last night while my servers were being moved. I started digging around for info on that patch the other Mac is wearing. I thought you said it was a dead end. Yeah, someone with some mad skills did a serious scrubbing job on that info, that's for sure. But I found a blog from a conspiracy theorist in London who says he has inside information. Doesn't get more legitimate than that. Hey, you take what you can get, right? But if he's right, A.R.C stands for "Anomaly Research Center." No way. Looks like the uk had a dinosaur problem too. Wait. So I was doing the same job back there? Well, you do have a knack for it. Did you tell Evan? No. I thought you would want to do that. Morning. Strange not to be able to enter the company you helped build. What are you doing here? I thought you worked for the competition now. I have to talk to you. Look, if you've come to apologize for your testimony, it's not necessary. I haven't. I told the truth. It's not my job to protect you anymore. Good. I don't need your protection. Actually, I think you're going to need it now more than ever. Yeah, thanks to your little friend Leeds. Guy was playing us from the start. He just took a very hard fall for you. You should be thanking him. Thanking him? I'm about this close to being locked up because of him. He was locked up because of you. He still would be if I hadn't gotten him out. All right, there are some dots I'm not connecting here. If you work at Seung, how did you pull a guy from lock-up? I'm not at Seung. I took another offer. I don't like where this is going. Colonel Hall has asked me to be the civilian director at Project Magnet. I accepted. Why? Trust me, Evan, I would love to be on my way to my new job right now. I would love to never hear another word about anomalies or dinosaurs ever again, and I sure as hell would love to not to be standing here having this conversation with you. All right. Then cut the crap. What do you want? I want you to join my team... Hall's team. So, you're going to re-engineer the planet with him, huh? Did he tell you about his brilliant idea to create some new kind of oil? You have to look at his entire plan, Evan. It's not just about one idea. If he could find a way to stop global warming, or save oceans, or keep billions of people from starving, do you really think that would be such a bad idea? There's too many variables. Yeah, sure, he could fix one thing, but then a hundred other things could go wrong. Then take a seat at the table and help guide this. I'm never going to help that man. I'm not asking you to help him. I'm asking you to help me. Hey, we can test it... Hello, Toby. Oh. Hi, Ange. I'll show you out. I know the way. What have you got? An anomaly just opened up at Britannia Beach. What is this place? It's an old copper mine. It was shut down years ago. It's in that building. Door's blown out and tracks on the ground. That looks like trouble. Something left and came back in again dragging something heavy. Like, person heavy? Can't say yet. Any idea what it is? Small feet, but lots of them. Four, possibly eight. An arthropod of some kind. Exoskeleton, maybe claws? Hope it's not a crab. I didn't bring any butter. Holy crap. Toby, stay behind me. But it's right there. I have to get closer to get a reading. Just stay behind me. Movement! We've got this. Stay close. Okay, baby, show me what you got. It's working! It should be open for 48 minutes. Good work. You just made our job a lot easier. Wait a minute, now it says 16 minutes. I don't understand. It's cycling up like it's supposed to, but it just can't seem to make up its mind. Maybe I missed something. No, it's operational, but it's processing phantom data. Background radiation from the mine, maybe. I'm sorry. Don't be. It's the first trial. A few more tweaks, we'll get it right. Down! What's going on? The shell's too hard. Evan, it's up here! It can climb walls! What is it? Giant bug thing! Wait, I can see it! It's out here! Some kind of chelicerata. Brontoscorpio, maybe? If that means "giant scorpion," I'll go with that. It went under the pipe, guys! Try to knock it down. Dylan! Incoming! Tried that! Aim for its mouth! I'm out. Okay, guys, let's make a shield and push it back! It's through. Hey, guys? Do you think that thing's tail is poisonous? Yeah. Almost certainly. How do you feel? Um, I'm a little freaked out. It's not that deep, but we have to get you to an E.R. right now. Vancouver General won't know how to treat this. I don't have time to explain it. I've got another idea. Please tell me you've come to your senses and are taking my offer. That's not what this is about. You said you were hiring the best, right? Do you have a toxicologist? Mara Fridkin. No one better. Why? It's Toby. We're at Britannia Mines, and she was just stung by a giant scorpion. I'll send in a medical team. Fridkin. Medevac chopper. Britannia mines. Go with them. Thanks. See? There are benefits to cooperation. We have a situation. Cross's lead tech has been attacked and stung by a creature. Wait a minute, so, wait, there's another anomaly? And Cross knows about it? Yes. I've instructed Dr. Fridkin to suspend research and focus all efforts on helping Toby. Toby Nance, that's the one who helped Cross build the detector? I would hate for something to happen to her. Oh, no, of course. You do whatever it takes to keep her alive. I already am. You realize this means that Cross still has a functioning detection network. Toby first, then Evan. Tell me when the numbness stops and the feeling starts. No. No. No... yes! Yes, I can feel that. Okay, we're going to make sure you'll be okay. It wasn't a direct sting. If it was, she'd be dead by now. Now, I can slow the effects with epinephrine, but to save her, I'll need a targeted anti-toxin. Don't you need a venom sample for that? - Can you get me one? - Yes! Do it quickly. No, no, wait, you can't! That anomaly could close at any second! You'll be trapped in there! This isn't up for discussion. Well, at least give me the data card so I can figure out how long you have. Keep this close. It's okay. Let's go! We'll be right back. It's okay. Why didn't you go with the chopper? I'm coming with you. This isn't an open house. We have a job to do. Ange told me they locked you up. Is that true? It was a temporary situation. It was resolved to my satisfaction. I think that's a yes. Sir. Military personnel only. You've gotta be kidding me. You know, this would be a whole lot easier if you were working with us. And if you weren't working against us. Tell them to let us in. Not unless I come with you. Fine. Great! Cool. I'll take your MP-7, and... this. Watch your fingers. Yes, sir. Thank you. Follow me. We get in, find the creature, get the venom, and get out. And no taking anything to cut up and put in a pickle jar. Yeah, I'm only here to help. It's kind of exciting though, huh? Going through an anomaly. Don't pretend like it's your first time. What are you doing? What if something attacks me? Well, you'll just have to be faster than one of us. That creature just got a hell of a lot harder to find. What is this place? Must be some kind of temporal junction. String theory has always predicted they exist. It follows, then, that anomalies are Einstein-Rosen Bridges... More commonly called "wormholes." Someone knows his physics. Part of the job. Stay alert, we're not alone. Hall can't find out about this. That may not be so easy. The collection team will already be on the way. Well, you better stop them. I'm supposed to stay with you. Ms. Finch was very clear. This is a joint mission. We don't need a chaperone. This is a doorway to a hundred times and places. You know what damage Hall could do if he finds out about this. All right, I'll take care of it. You're going to believe him? We don't have another choice. I assure you... Just... Keep them out. If you do, I might actually start to trust you. And if you don't, it'll be you on the dissection table. Don't make me do that. Good luck. Okay, I'm going to need you to stop the work and relax. Trust me, she'll be a lot less relaxed if you make her stop. I need to figure out how long they're going to have. I'm not letting them get stuck in big bug land. I just, I don't understand. I keep getting all these conflicting readings. Interference? Evan thinks that it's background radiation from the mines, but I... I filtered for that. I don't get it. I keep getting all these phantom signatures. You okay? Excuse me. Lie back. Tell me there's a trail. Otherwise I don't like our odds. There are a lot of tracks around here. It's pretty muddled up. Looks like it's been in and out of a few places. It stayed local, though. The tracks seem to circle back to the same area. Okay, then. Let's go. Hope it wasn't that one. We've got to move. What is it? You've got to see this. How is this possible? This is Cross Photonics. Not yet. Look at the wall. There's no marks. This is before I bought the building. Hey! Where are you going? I need to know what day it is. We can't be here. Just two minutes. September 15th, 2006. 12:10 P.M. She's alive. But in six hours, she's going to die. Unless I stop it. You know you can't do that. I can't let her die again. It's not your fault. But don't you see? If I do nothing, this time, it will be my fault. Just listen to yourself. You know this isn't right. If you do this, everything changes. Yeah, no more dinosaurs, no more Hall, and Toby will be fine. Hey, Toby will be fine, but not like this. You don't understand. Yeah, you're right. I don't. You think this could fix everything, but you can't know what would happen. It could just as easily make everything worse. We would never even have met. Maybe it would be better that way. You do what you need to do. I'm going to go find that scorpion. Lieutenant Leeds gave us direct orders not to let anyone in. Our standing directive is to collect specimens. Colonel Hall assured us full access, and full military support. Yes, sir. That's our assignment. But the lieutenant was very specific. Maybe you should check with Colonel Hall's office. Dr. Jardine! Dr. Jardine, hi. Hi. Uh, you may want to check your Secure-Com WCD for CFAC electronic communique one-one-two-seven-five backslash PM, forward slash Alpha Zulu, underscore "Welcome Aboard." Sent at 0900 hours. It says that, um, Angelika Finch is our new civilian director of operations. This is her mission, so we're here in a support capacity only. So what does she want us to do? Well, she need you to drive me back to the lab... What? Yup, and she needs you to stay here. When the civilians return, have them air-lifted to the facility, and then hold your post until I return. And nobody is to get in. Is that understood? Again, sir, not established protocol. Is that understood? Yes, sir. Okay. Super-doo. Great. Where's your car? Tobes, you can barely write. You need to stop. I need to figure this out. There has to be some constant in this data. How is she? Failing. Rapidly. I've ordered a blood transfusion. We're just waiting for the units to be delivered. When will it arrive? Shortly. It's not soon enough. I want all personnel type-matched for donation. Start with him. Okay. I'll be right back. Damn it! I just came to see how you were doing. I'm fine. And to apologize. For what? My preconceptions. When your resume first came across my desk, it went straight into the trash. I didn't think you were someone to take seriously. I get that a lot. But I was wrong. Toby, I've seen how committed you are to your work. How driven. We have that in common. You're not really working for them, are you? We're working together, just like we always have. But they're trying to take over. Yes, they are, and they should. Because if Project Magnet was in charge, you wouldn't be here. If they experiment on the anomalies, do you know how dangerous that could be? It can't go on like it is. Evan should have never put you in this situation. He didn't. The anomalies did. Then let's do something about that. Toby... Do you still think that there's a way to block them? Theoretically, yes. Then when you get out of here, I want you to work on making that theory real, okay? Whatever support you need, I will get for you. I'll talk to Evan about it. You don't need Evan's approval to do the right thing. If it was the right thing, then he would be doing it. He can't if he's in prison. They wouldn't really put him in prison, would they? Toby, you and I both know that Evan is not going to build that detection network that he promised. What did you think was going to happen? You can't let them lock him away, Ange. I can't help him. Not without that network. What if I told you where it was? I thought you destroyed it. What are you doing? We'll talk later. What's wrong? I can't feel anything, Mac. Can we get some help! I need a ventilator, stat! Careful! Sand traps! Here, throw me your rifle! Open your mouth, damn it. Go! Get the tail! Come on. Damn it! We'll catch it. Thanks. I wasn't sure you'd be coming. Well, I can't let you have all the fun. Hey, how's she doing? Not well. I've been meaning to ask you. Our new director, Ms. Finch, will I be reporting to you or to her? To both of us. Why? Because she's not going to be very happy with me if her friend dies in our care. Well, don't let her die. We're out of our depth here. Well, then, we'll all have to learn to swim. Look, there's no training for what we're trying to do here, so the best we are going to be able to do is to trust our gut and do our best. You seem very sure, sir. Well, we're all part of the same team here. We all have one goal, to save the world, starting with your patient. Awesome, tremors! That makes it easier. What the hell are you doing? She's got enough poison to fight without you adding to it. Oh, and you think this is going the way it should? Toby is dying. They're going to make it. And what if they don't? Could Project Magnet running things really be that much worse? It's Toby. They'll make it. I hope you're right. But even if you are, I'm not doing things Evan's way anymore. Hey, if that's its burrow, we've got it cornered. Yeah, well, it's got a serious home court advantage in there. Seems pretty solid. Yeah, except for the tremor part. This hillside is honeycombed with interlocking tunnels. Yeah, and it's on top of a major fault line. See? I saved some fun for you. What made you decide not to do it? The fact that you're right. Right now we need to worry about Toby. There's something up there. Direct hit. At least he went quickly. His insides are sucked out. We need to get that venom. That's some high quality tiger blood you're getting there. Don't worry, it's just temporary. They'll be back soon. Why aren't they back yet? I don't know. I'm going to send in a rescue team. You can't do that. Why? Trust me, you just, you can't. That's all you're going to say? I promised Evan. The days of Evan Cross setting the agenda are over. I thought that was understood. Of course, it's just... I like to keep my word, whenever possible. If there is something that I need to know, I expect you to share it. I understand. Now, unless you can give me a very convincing reason not to, I'm sending in a team to get them out of there. It's some sort of junction. Multiple anomalies. They lead everywhere. But you can't tell the colonel. No. No more secrets. If we're going to control these things, we need to know all we can about them. There. It doesn't like us. Well, you just force-fed it a 50,000-volt breath mint. Now we just need to figure out how to get to its backside. If we move in, it'll be forced to attack. Then one of us can get behind it. Okay. All right, you keep it busy, I'll go for the tail. Got it! Let's get out of here. Dylan! Evan! Dylan! You okay? Alive. Are you hurt? No! But I'm trapped. I'm out! I'm good. Hey, can you dig out? No! Seems pretty solid. You okay over there? Hang on. I got the tail! And it looks okay. Great! Great. Okay, uh, you gotta go. What? Look, don't fight me on this. Toby doesn't have time. No. No way. I can't just leave you. Get the venom back to Magnet, and then find something, come back here and move these rocks. And what if the anomaly closes while I'm gone? Well, then, I'm going to be really glad to know that you got out before it did. Evan... Look, my chances of surviving until you come back are a hell of a lot better than Toby's if you keep wasting time. So will you just please go? Please? Fine. But I'll be right back. Good. I'll see you soon, then. Okay. Sorry, you've got to go. I need you to move. She's asystolic! I need the crash cart! Starting compressions. Goddamn it. 5 ccs adrenaline push. Stand by for defib. Where's my defibrillator? Come on, Toby, fight for it. Let's go! Let's go! Come on, Toby... ==sync, correction by dcdah== for addic7ed.com
