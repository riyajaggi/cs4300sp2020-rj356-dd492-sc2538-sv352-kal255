 ...without leads as to the girl's whereabouts. [COCKS GUN] Uhh. Uhh! It's all here. Take care of her. [MUFFLED GASP] [GRUNTING] Batman! Uhh. Uhh. Uhh. [GROANING] Are you all right? [MUFFLED SCREAM] Ah!

 Uhh. Uhh! Uhh! [GROANING] [HEART BEATING] Ever since I was a kid, big bad Batman's always been making life hard for guys like me. [WHACKING] Uhh! Ah! [GASPS] No. Don't. [TIRES SCREECH] Freeze! [POLICE SIREN] [PANTING] [BAT SCREECHES] Never again. [POLICE SIREN] REPORTER: Making news today as every day, Gotham's own financial czar Derek Powers rocked the stock market by acquiring several local industrial firms. Everyone loves a winner, right, Kim? That's right, Tom. In the third hostile Wayne-Powers takeover this year, Powers has retained his crown as Gotham's most dynamic corporate kingpin. Insiders' fears of downsizing were realized today as Powers personally announced over 300 layoffs. The handsome CEO may not be making many friends, but he's sure making money. Turning to the local weather... Thank you, thank you. Ah! Oh, I saw you smile. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. [CLEARS THROAT] What do you want? Payment for the joke you bought. I give you funny, you give me money. I didn't buy anything. Aw, you're shy. It's ok. I'll just help myself. Ha ha ha. Get lost, clown. Ho ho, big man. Ah! That does it. Kwah! Hyah! Whtah! [SPUTTERING] [LAUGHS] Jokerz. If the coach had us do one more lap, I'd be sprouting gills. GUYS: Nelson! Nelson! Nelson! Nelson! Nelson! Sounds like Nelson's got his monkey's rooting for him again. You got him. Who's the victim this time? Terry? Come on, man! Just do it. You got him. You got him. My money's on Nelson. I wouldn't be too sure, Chelsea. You've never wrestled with him. Fold, dreg, I got you beat. Funny, you remind me of a joker I met this morning. Except he was prettier. Uhh. Ah! [WHISTLE BLOWS] Oh, boy. Not again. [BOTH GRUNTING] That's it, McGinnis. Get your clothes and get out. - But he just-- - But nothing. I saw you throw the first punch. Out. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Research. McGinnis. Warren, it's Harry. Can you meet me on the landing right away? Sure. Is everything all right? I'll explain when I see you. Harry? You look slagged. Never mind that. Here. Keep this for me. What's wrong with your hand? Nothing. Warren, if anything should happen to me-- There you are, Mr. Tully. You're late for your meeting with Mr. Powers. Harry! Come back here. Ah! [GROANING] What's wrong with him? I asked you here, Warren, to clear up any misconceptions you might have gotten from that incident with Mr. Tully. Harry simply suffered an allergic reaction to a chemical compound in the lab. Shook him up a bit, but he's under the best of care. That's great. When can I see him? Monday morning first thing. Thank you, Mr. Powers. Don't mention it, Warren. Oh, Warren, before I forget, there seems to be a file missing from Harry's records. Would you know where it is? No, sir. I have no idea. No, of course not. Harry, what were you working on? Powers can't be serious. He must be out of his mind to think-- Knock, knock. Terry, I'm busy. Dad, I gotta go out. You're grounded, remember? I didn't start the fight. I'll hear all about it when we meet with your counselor. Again. Mom would hear me out. You're not living with your mom. Don't remind me. That's your problem right there. You can't control your temper. And you'd better if you expect to get anywhere in life. Yeah, I'll be a big success just like you. I'm bailing. Terry. [MUSIC PLAYS] Boo. Hey, I thought you were in solitary. I gave myself time off for good behavior. I'm glad. [TIRES SCREECH] Whoa. Don't go messing things up again. [HONK HONK] [HONKING] Evening, boys and girls. Who's up for some laughs? [LAUGHTER] Hey! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ow! You're not smiling. Knock it off. I would if you'd hold still. Uhh! Aah! Cheer up, sweetness. Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle. Stop. Hands off, dreg. Aah! Uhh. [LAUGHTER] Split his sides. Ah! I knew McGinnis was a freak job. Oh, no. Fun time. Ha ha ha ha ha! Get out of here! Hurry! [LAUGHTER] JOKERZ: Uhh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Uhh! [LAUGHTER] Aw, the no-fun boy had an accident. Let's put a smile on his face. Leave him alone. And get off my property. You're trespassing. Oh, is that right? It's ok, I can handle this. Who do you think you're talking to, old man? We're the Jokerz. Sure you are. Uhh. [GRUNTING] Ah! Uhh! Aah! Oh! Uhh. Come on! Man, you're something. I've never seen anyone... [PANTING] Are you ok? My medicine. At the house. [BARKING] Down, Ace. He's ok. [GROWLING] Nice dog. Not really. Here you go. The pills were right where you said. [SIGHS] Well, then, I guess you're gonna rest now, huh? You go right ahead. My dad's probably waiting up for me anyway. I'll just let myself out. I hope you feel better, Mister-- [SNORING] [SNORING] [BARKING] On second thought, maybe I should give my dad a call. Here's where I'm grounded for life. [SCREECHING, WINGS FLAPPING] A bat? I'll get you out of there, just don't bite me. Huh? Whoa. [SCREECHING] Jeez, no wonder he could fight. Uhh! Uhh. Get out. [GROWLING] All right, I'm going. It's not like I did anything wrong. Freak. [INDISTINCT SPEECH ON RADIO] Dad? Oh, my God. Terry. You're ok. Mom, what happened? A robbery. The police say it's the Jokerz. They surprised your father. Where is he? Where's Dad? Honey, I-- Dad? Dad! REPORTER: McGinnis leaves behind two sons. Seen here with his former wife Mary. Among the mourners was McGinnis' employer Derek Powers. I pledge to use whatever influence I have to see that these creatures pay for their heinous act. It was about Dad. I know, hon. Why don't you get ready for bed, ok? Ok. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] That friend of yours Dana called. She left her number. Have you eaten anything yet? Ter, you haven't said a word all day. Don't you want to talk? Why would he open the door, Mom? What? They were Jokerz. He wouldn't have opened the door. He would've looked first. How'd they trace me back to him? Honey, we don't know if it's the same gang. You've got to stop-- I should've been there. I could've helped him. I-I could've done something. No. Yes! I'm not afraid of those guys. We could've fought 'em off, me and Dad. We could've fought-- I yelled at him, mom. He grounded me, and I wouldn't listen. The things I said. I'm such a jerk. Hurry up. I'm opening as fast as I can. You're some help, you know that? It's not my junk. Aah. I guess that's my fault, too. Aah! "In the event of my death or disappearance..." Whoa. What you got? Something Dad was looking at. Boring. Tell Mom I had to go. I could be late. Where you going? Out. Yeah, looks like we got lucky. If you just keep on this road, curves back to the freeway. I can't leave you out here. Sure you can. I just have to see this guy. [THUNDER] About what? I'll explain later. You better go before the storm hits. Go. Come on, I know you're in there. Listen to me. Something stinks in your company! I think it cost my old man his life! The answer's on this. I'd take it to the cops, but you know how cozy they are with Powers. How 'bout you taking a look? Yeah, I should've known you wouldn't care. You're no Batman, you wacked out old fraud! [GROWLING] Back off, Scooby. It's me.
