 [CLICKING] You hear that? You can poach an egg in this water. That must be where they're loading the radioactive waste before dumping it out at sea. [BEEP OF TRUCK BACKING UP] [BRAKES SQUEAL] Make it snappy. We got 20 minutes before the next harbor patrol. [SCREAMS] Hey!

 Unh! Unh! Aah! [GROANS] Who hired you? Think I'd tell you? Aah! Unh. [BEEPS] [WHISPERING] Mr. Powers, it's been a long night. My clients would like to go back to their hotel and rest a little and think about your offer. Ladies and gentlemen, the buyout offer is on the table. Leave this room, and I withdraw it.

 [WHISPERING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] Powers. Amazing the numbers people put on their speed dial. Just wanted you to know, tonight's boat ride has been canceled, though your goons are still going up the river. Wish you could join them. [WHISPERING] Sir, your eyes. My friends, perhaps you're right. It is an ungodly hour. We'll continue this negotiation tomorrow when we're refreshed. It's useless. It barely lasts a day anymore. What do I pay you people for? It's not the skin, sir. The radiation you're emitting is getting stronger. Is that supposed to pacify me? Mr. Powers? I have a suggestion. Who are you? She's new here, Mr. Powers. She really shouldn't be-- I'm Dr. Lake. Stephanie Lake. What's this suggestion of yours? I could use your baseline DNA to build you a new body, then transfer your neural patterns into it. Dr. Lake, it's not your place to-- A new body? Theoretically, it should work. Of course I would want to test the process first on someone who also has systemically damaged DNA. You have someone in mind? Take a good look, doctor. I've been like this for nearly 50 years, and I haven't aged one day. I have become what many men have dreamed of... An immortal. And yet, there hasn't been a day, an hour, a minute I haven't thought about death. It obsesses me. Even now. What if I said I could give you life? A normal life. Bah. Victor, an incredible mind like yours deserves a body. Dr. Lake and I have taken every precaution, Victor. Let me assure you. Save your breath. I am neither afraid nor capable of being comforted by your banal words. Remember, there might be some momentary discomfort. Ohhhh! Aaaahh! Aah! No! Uh... Welcome back to the living. I don't think you should-- Let's see what he can do. Cold. It feels... cold. So, Dana, you got time for a fizz or something? I do, but you don't. Your keeper's here. Victor Fries has paid his debt to society, and now with the help of the great medical minds of Wayne-Powers, he's returned to a normal life. - When was this on? - This morning. My fervent hope is that the technology used to help Victor will serve to help millions more. I want you to follow Fries. Don't let him out of your sight. Why? I don't trust him. Powers or Fries? Neither. [MEOW] Molly! [MEOW] Yeah, there's a menace to society. Victor Fries? How fitting that that diseased skull of mine should be buried like this. Frankly, I couldn't think of anything else to do with it. It was the right thing. It symbolizes the end of a life and the beginning of a new one. [GUNFIRE] Stay down. Unh! No, no! He's gotta die! The monster's gotta die! How could you save him? After what he did. What he did to me. What did I do? You destroyed my life, my family, years ago. Gone. Frozen. Forever. We'll let the police take care of him. No. I've done this man enough damage. No words can express my sorrow for the pain I've caused you. I beg your forgiveness. It was another life, though that's hardly an excuse. I can only promise you this-- I will do the best I can to make reparations to you and everyone I've ever hurt. I'm calling it the Nora Fries Foundation, named after my former wife. And you intend to fund it yourself? Before I went to prison, my legitimate earnings were put in a blind trust. After all these years, it comes to quite a significant sum. A half billion, I hear. That's some charity. Not charity... Justice. More like blood money. Come on, can't you cut him a little slack? Like my mom said, he's just a guy trying to put his house in order. It's a cold draft that blows through that house. MAN: Ok, people, thank you. That's a wrap. Good job, Victor. Thank you. My, it's a little warm in here. It's the lights. And they say we don't work hard for our money. There. No doubt about it. He's reverting. Why? How? Don't you know what this means to me? There must be some kind of pneumonic agent within the DNA. If only we could biopsy his organs at this stage. That might be doable. Stephanie? Stephanie! What are you doing? No! Please! Open the door! Please. Please. Ahh. Ohh. Ugh! Ohhh. Even if he ran away like you heard, it doesn't mean he's gonna come back. He'll be back. Count on it. He lives for revenge. Not the Victor Fries I met. What you met was a ghost. Security's checked every meat locker, deep freeze, and cryogenic plant in town. No sign of him. We never should have started this. Sometimes you find the wrong answers before you find the right ones. That's what science is all about. And anyway, if he's still hiding in Gotham, he's fried. What makes you so sure? We're having a heat wave, Mr. Powers. Today it hit 70. [BOOM] [GASPS] Hey! What's-- what's going on? Where's that coming from? Ugh! Oh, Fries. Fries! How-- It's something I've kept in cold storage. You have this all wrong. Do I? STEPHANIE: Victor, don't do it... Please. Aah! We were only trying to help you. Remember, there might be some momentary discomfort. [STEPHANIE SCREAMS] MAN: Fire! [TIRES SCREECH] [ENGINE WHIRS] There's enough energy here to destroy the whole compound, Batman. I suggest you find a way out. Fries, think. This can't be what you want. You'll only cause more pain, more suffering. No, I end it. When this goes, I go, too. [STRAINS] You had your chance. POWERS: So did you. Aah! Yeah, you feel it, don't you? Right through your suit. The heat is on, Victor. Terry, I can't maintain video link. What's going on? No! Behold, I shall be a blight upon the land, and every thing I touch shall wither and die. Batman. And who are you, sunshine? Blight will do. Ugh! Aah! Ohh! [STATIC] Terry, there's something hot in that room. Ugh! No kidding. This guy... He's like a walking meltdown. Keep your distance. The suit will give you some protection, but it's not designed for such high levels of radiation. Ohh! You only got a tan that time, Batman. Here comes the real burn. Blight! Stay where you are. [LABORED BREATHING] [BUILDING GROANS] You gotta get out of here, Fries. The whole place is gonna go. Believe me... You're the only one who cares. Terry, get out of there now! Fries, no! Mr. Powers. Thank heavens. We used an infrared scan to locate you. Not that you would have been hard to spot without it. We also brought these, just in case you were cold. You are idiots. [BEEP] TERRY: With all his injuries and that cracked helmet, no way he got out. It could have been worse. He could have blown up the whole compound like he intended. Killed hundreds. Guess you were right about Fries all along. We both were.
