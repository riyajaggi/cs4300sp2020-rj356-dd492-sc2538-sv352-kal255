 ANNOUNCER: Previously on Batman Beyond... I asked you here, Warren, to clear up any misconceptions you might've gotten from that incident with Mr. Tully. Harry simply suffered an allergic reaction to a chemical compound in the lab. Oh, Warren. There seems to be a file missing from Harry's records. Would you know where it is? Aah! Leave him alone...

 And get off my property. M-my medicine. At the house. Dad? Oh, my God. Listen to me. Something stinks in your company! I think it cost my old man his life! The answer's on this. It's worse than I thought. It's some kind of new DNA mutagen. Powers is making nerve gas. He's using my company to make nerve gas. Stay away from that.

 Synaptic controls, neuromuscular amplification, flight capability. Humph. This thing might be old, but it's still cutting-edge. Bet it amplifies your strength by at least 10 to 1. I told you not to touch it. - But aren't you gonna go to-- - No! You built that company, and now Powers is making nerve gas there. You gotta do something. You're Batman. I was Batman. Give this to commissioner Barbara Gordon. Tell her I sent you. The cops? They'll never be able to-- Do it. Something happened to you, didn't it? And it wasn't just that you got old. Hey! Oops. Hello, Terry. Ever had a ride in a limo? My dad always told me to never take rides from strangers. Who's a stranger? Besides, your dad's not around anymore. Be smart, Terry. Get in. I'll pass. Let go of me! What are you doing? You some kind of sicko? Help! Help! That won't do you any good, Terry. Why don't you make it easy on yourself and give me back my disk? What disk? You know what I'm talking about. All right. If he lets go. Happy? Unh! POWERS: Enough. Well, at least I've got the evidence. Gotham rolled out the red carpet today for Kasnian Minister of Commerce Vilmos Egans. Mr. Egans is here to take part in the World-Trade Confab and was greeted by no less than Wayne-Powers C.E.O. Derek Powers. [DOG BARKING] What is it? What's the matter, boy? [BARKING] [BARKING] [GRUNTING] Ohh. Better. POWERS: It's the ultimate in germ warfare. A viral mutagen so quick-acting and completely invasive, no living cell can resist it. It all began with experiments on plants. Impressive. But we are looking to do more than wipe out our enemies' crops, Mr. Powers. Keep watching. This was our first experiment with livestock. POWERS: I trust the film puts to rest any lingering doubts, Mr. Egans. As you can see, the results are the same, even with animals. And humans? You've tested it on them, too? The laws here aren't as liberal about that sort of thing as they are in your country, but we did have a little accident-- One of my workers. Terrible thing. There was a gas leak in his lab. This was what he looked like the next day. 2 hours later. An hour after that. There is no cure? Extreme heat or radiation, but at this stage, it's obviously not an option. Dust to dust. Consider what a real dose of this gas could do to those six armored divisions your neighbors keep on your border. Gone... In a matter of hours. Delivery, it's in progress? My men are loading the canisters as we speak. They leave tonight on hover transport. My assistant Mr. Fixx will personally supervise the shipment. Excellent. Good-bye, Mr. Powers. I will see you again soon. I hope. Yes, soon. Mr. Fixx, any word on the kid? Not yet, but they're looking. I don't have to tell you how important this deal is to Wayne-Powers. It's going to open up the entire eastern bloc for us, so I don't need it spoiled by a snot-nosed punk. I took care of his old man, didn't I? MAN: Little early for Halloween. But just in time for fall. Hit the alarms! [ALARM BLARING] It's Powers. What's going on? Batman? Or some guy dressed like him. We're cutting him off. Shouldn't be a problem. Ha ha ha ha! Batman. McGinnis. Can you hear me? Who-who's that? It's Wayne. Mr. Wayne? W-where are you? In the radio receiver in your cowl. Now listen to me, McGinnis. I want that suit back, and I want it now. Uh, now's not a good time. That suit is not yours. You had no right! Somebody had to do something, and you sure weren't about to. I'm warning you. He's over there! Over there! This suit works even better than I thought it would. WAYNE: This is your last chance. Better take it. No, thanks. Having too much fun. Fun, huh? Oof! Aah! He's mine! Hey... I can't move. What'd you do? WAYNE: It's a fail-safe device-- paralyzes the suit in case the wrong person gets into it. But you can't. I just did. Hey... Hey! Oof! Come on. You gotta help me. [KICKING AND GROANING] GUARD: Give him another... [KICKING AND GRUNTING] [WHINES] Out of the way. [COCKS GUN] Wayne, they're gonna kill me. Yeah! WAYNE: McGinnis, I gave you a break. Now bring that suit back. Love to, but I got these guards all over me. There's a broom closet on the north wall. Can you get to it? A broom closet? Do it. Did you see him? Where is he? This way. This way. Ok, let's go! Now I'm a sitting duck. Hope you're happy. The far wall-- put your hand against it. Press hard. [GRUNTS] Cool. WAYNE: I built the place, remember. Then you'd know where they'd be loading a hover transport, wouldn't you? Forget it. You're coming back here. Powers is shipping out the virus tonight. It's gotta be stopped. I'll call the police. Let them handle it. I can do it! I'll shut down the suit again, and this time, it'll be for good. McGINNIS: I read up on you, Mr. Wayne. I know how you lost your folks. The guy who murdered my dad is on that transport. This is my one chance to nail him. [SIGHS] WAYNE: The hover pads are in the northeast sector. Wish me luck. Good luck. [BEEPING] [INAUDIBLE] You said he wouldn't be a problem. Well, deal with it. Almost done loading. The sooner the better. They haven't found our trespasser yet, and I don't want him interfering. Hey, look! There he is! [ALL GRUNTING] You're out of business as of now. And as for you, Fixx, I'm taking you in for the murder of-- Unh! Get that hovercraft into the air! [GROANS] [GASPS] [GRUNTING] Unh! Shut the cargo doors! Like shooting skeet. Aah! Oof! No. [SCREAMS] [COUGHING] [GASPS] Help me. Help me! - Whoa! - Whoa! Unh! Oof! You're pretty strong for some clown who thinks he's Batman. I am Batman. Unh! Aah! [GASPING] [HORNS HONKING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] MARY: Terry. Honey? Wha... Quick. Get dressed. We have company. Company? Mr. Bruce Wayne. He's here to see you. I hope you don't mind milk. We're out of cream. I prefer it. Terence. Sorry to get you up so early. It's ok. You never told me you knew Bruce Wayne. Well, actually, uh... Why, I owe this boy my life. He defended me against a bunch of hooligans once. I tried to reward him, but he absolutely refused. Mr. Wayne wants to offer you a job. A job? It's not much, mind you. I find that in my old age, I could use a part-time assistant, you know, a gofer-- Go fer this, go fer that. An ally, as it were. Would you be interested? Of course he would. Wouldn't you, honey? I mean, to work with someone as famous as Mr. Wayne... Sure. I warn you, I can be a difficult taskmaster. I accept nothing short of excellence from all who work for me. I think I can handle it. Very good, then, Mr. McGinnis. Welcome to my world. The good news is the radiation seems to have completely eradicated the virus. What's the bad news? As you know, the mutational properties of the virus can be corrupted by its environment. Unh! Bottom-line it, Doctor. Kill the radiation, please. [POWERS LAUGHING] [LAUGHING MANIACALLY]
