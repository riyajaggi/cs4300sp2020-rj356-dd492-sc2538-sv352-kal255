 And of course, trumpeters. (TRUMPETS PLAY NEWS JINGLE) But first, a film report from Eamonn Duckhawker on the present situation in Hamburg. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Here in Munich today, the mood is one of tranquillity almost of calm. But beneath the facade, under the surface below the veneer of apparent calm, one can sense almost feel a certain tension, or lack of tension which is reflected in the seemingly impassive faces of the ordinary passers-by as they pass and re-pass, going about their various ways. Their faces reflecting little if any, in fact, none of the tension, or lack of tension, I referred to previously.

 On the face of it then, just an ordinary city an ordinary day, ordinary people. But is it all as ordinary as it seems? I'm afraid it is. And with that, this is Onan Duckhawker returning you from the brightly lit cafés of the Volkenrubenstrasse to the studio. Good night. Our reporter on anything from anywhere reporting about nothing. And now, an interview with the Minister of Housing. - Good evening. - Good evening. I have with me here in the studio, Mr Harold Yeti-Goosecreature. I have with me in the studio, Marsden Ganderpoke. - Yes, I know. - Yes. Now, Mr Yeti-Goosecreature, you're the Minister of Housing. No, I'm not, I'm the interviewer, you're the Minister of Housing. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - Aren't you? - No, I'm not. I'm the interviewer. We're both... we're both interviewers. - Um... - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - Yes, well... - Oh... But, uh... but then... Well, um, oh... (THEY SING: "FALLING IN LOVE WITH LOVE" BY ROGERS AND HART) # Falling in love with love is falling for make believe # # Falling in love with love is falling for love # At this very spot this morning yet another successful wage-snatch was carried out. Our man on the spot, Tumbril McPosingbrief reports from the spot... he's on. - (LOUD TRAFFIC BLARES) - (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) - (HORNS HONK) - (LOUD TRAFFIC BLARES) (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Well... at this point, we were to have had a film report from Teddy Vole on the revolution in the Bahamas but unfortunately the film hasn't arrived and so while, uh... oh. Hello? Hello, darling, I... l... Well, it's a bit awkward at the moment because... Um... You know I do. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Very, very much. Yes. Bye, heart face. Well, the producer says the film has arrived... and so over now to Teddy Vole with a film report on the revolution in the Bahamas that we've been waiting for for several weeks. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...week, Watooka receives its independence. What are the problems facing this new state? Will disillusionment follow the heavy triumphs of hard-won freedom or will the people support Premier Mbala's provisional government? And who is the strongman behind Mbala? Is it Mbili, Bombolo Bombaga or Ndaka? And where is Yettigonga? Is he in Mattobisi with Katashi? Or has he gone to see Mbaka in Katanga? And where are Mbuku Nonanga, Umpopo and Gondoli? Is Umboko behind Mbili? And if Mbaka is behind Mumboko against Katashi will Umbuku join Nananga in Ketongi? All these questions can and must be answered. Good night. This is the face of Aristide Goulet the French trade union leader. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Aristide... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Ah, that's more like it. And now, a film report of particular interest starring me. Wake up, everyone at home. Come on, wake up. Watch the screen. It's about me. Wake up. Hello. Well, I'm standing in the Kings Road and I'm going to stop some passers-by and ask them if they agree with the opinion expressed on "24 Hours and Hours" last week that the church is losing prestige by seeking too much publicity. Um, you, sir... Do you agree with this view? Well, I know what you mean. We have seen a lot of them recently. On Sundays, you see them for a couple of hours and late at night, I always go to bed thinking of vicars 'cause they're always on. But I'd say definitely. Uh, you do. You feel they're losing publicity? Ah, definitely. - Gaining publicity but losing... - Definitely not. - Definitely which? - Definitely not losing prestige or publicity. - Oh, not losing prestige? You don't feel that although perhaps television is a popular entertainment medium - that... - Well, that's why they should use it. It's not for me to say, but that's why they should actually... - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - (DIALOGUE BECOMES INAUDIBLE) Pray in St Mark's! - Pray in St Mark's! - (INDISTINCT SHOUTS) - St Peter's! - (VICARS CLAMOUR) Uh, I think... (VICARS SHOUT) Hello. There's been a lot of talk recently about the invasion of people's privacy by the mass media. Well, I'm out here in the street to ask one or two of the ordinary passers-by what they think of this. Now... Oh, uh... I'll ask one or two of the ordinary passers-by what they think of... uh, there's a gentleman coming here. I'll just ask him what he thinks. On this subject. I'll ask him in fact, what he... thinks about the invasion of people's privacy by the mass media. Um... Sir, hello. I wonder if you'd mind answering a few questions... - No, no. I don't want to be interviewed. - Oh, well, please... - Doesn't seem to be anyone else around. - No. I don't... thank you, no. - I don't want to be interviewed. - I wondered if you'd mind - answering a few questions. - I don't want to be interviewed! REPORTER: Look, please. Could you? Please, no, look... Please, would you mind answering a few questions? MAN: I don't want to answer any questions! - REPORTER: Come here, now! - I don't want to answer questions. On whether or not you think the mass media are invading people's privacy. - Well, I don't... - Oh, um, terribly sorry. - You've hit me in the eye! - Please, um... - You've hit me in the eye! - Will you answer a few questions, please? - You've hit me in the eye! - Are you alright? I mean, it's... - You hit me in the eye! - Please, would you mind? - (MAN SOBS) - Oh, uh, would you... I say, would you mind, uh... - (MAN SOBS) - (VICARS CLAMOUR) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) The publication of the Staybaker-Waring report this morning has already sparked off a holocaust of public indifference. And so to pad the programme out a bit we've invited along some experts to discuss some of the issues arising from the report. We have with us, Nigel Stanley the political correspondent for the Stoat Breeder's Gazette. - Evening. - PRESENTER: Dr Marcus Flute reader in Comparative Goat Sexing at the University of Melbourne. Thank you for coming. Sir Arthur Myxomatosis formerly vice-chairman of the Acme Inflatable Greengrocer Company - and an ex-male model. - Hello there. Rebecca Owltruss - fashion editor of "Toad". - Hello. Habbakuk Truffit MP. Wing Commander Bransby Snake-Sinus, an old friend of ours... Hairy Loomis, the celebrated washroom attendant Milton Stagbottler, carpet moistener to the Dutch royal family. Hello, again. Paradine Lust, the Harley Street unicyclist. The Reverend Unseemly Dogposture. The Flying Hutchisons and Lucile. Lord Christine Wheedon Boob-Trinket, founder of "Rent-a-Bishop" and Gareth, his educated goat. Well, I'm afraid that's all we have time for tonight and so, good night. Let's have some more news. Who says we can't get in the ratings? (FANFARE PLAYS) Oh, hello, at last. A question that must be nagging in most of your minds is whether the lovely Aimi MacDonald, that's me can do anything else besides sing dance, tell jokes, look very, very lovely juggle, and be an extremely accomplished ventriloquist. Well, of course she can. I'm also a truly wonderful satirical impressionist. So now, Aimi "The Girl With a Million Voices" MacDonald will do her first satirical impression on television. Tonight, it's an old friend of ours. I'm sure you'll all recognise him. (MAN'S VOICE ON TAPE): Hello, I'm the lovely Harold Wilson. Do you know what I mean, darling? (IN NORMAL VOICE): It might not be a very good impression but it's better than the one he does of me! (HURDY GURDY WALTZ PLAYS) (HURDY GURDY WALTZ PLAYS) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYS) (HE TUTS) Uh, excuse me. Is this seat occupied? - No. - Oh. (HE TUTS) Uh, excuse me. Would you mind if I change places with you? - What? - Could I sit there? Er, yes. I suppose so. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. - What? - I thought I would like sitting here. But now I'm here, I find it's not as good as I thought it would be. - Oh. - So, I'll sit there. Um... Do you mind if I smoke? Er, no. Not at all. - Are you sure? - Yes, thank you. You're not just saying that to be polite? No, no, no. Please do smoke. Only, you would say if you didn't want me to? Yes, I would. - Really? - Yes, I promise I would. So you don't mind if I smoke? No. (HE CLEARS HIS THROAT) Only some people might object. Yes, but not me. I was just making sure. - Thank you. - I wish I had a cigarette. I wish I had a cigarette that I could smoke. - If only I had a cigarette. - Do you want a cigarette? Oh, oh, oh! Er, no, I don't think I will. - Please, take one. - No, I mustn't, no. - No, take one. - No, no, really. No. Alright. I wish I hadn't refused that cigarette. How I wish I hadn't refused the cigarette that nice gentleman offered me because... oh! Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. - Aren't you going to smoke it? - Oh, no. You see, if I smoke it now I won't have one for after. - After what? - After I've smoked this one. If I had two cigarettes now, it would be plain sailing. Yes, what I chiefly need is two cigarettes. - Have another cigarette. - Oh, thank you. - Keep the packet. - Oh, thank you very much. - Not at all. - No, thank you, though. - OK. - No, but thank you. That's alright. - Yes, but thank you. - Shut up! (HE SQUAWKS) - What was that? - It was me. It's a speech impediment. I used to go... (HE SQUAWKS) ...after every second word. I used to say... Hello there... (HE SQUAWKS) Mr Moonstreet. (HE SQUAWKS) How are... (HE SQUAWKS) you today? (HE SQUAWKS) I'm fine. (HE SQUAWKS) Yes, yes, I do follow. I do understand. They cured me at the hospital though. The doctors, they were wonderful. They stopped me going... (HE SQUAWKS) ...after every second word. How? They said, "Don't go... (HE SQUAWKS) ...after every second word." And it worked. Now I only go... (HE SQUAWKS) ...when I want to. (HE SQUAWKS) I wanted to then. Once upon a time, there was a fairy prince and his name was Arthur Aldridge and he got on a train and a magic wizard gave him some cigarettes. - Magic cigarettes. - What are you talking about? I'm telling myself a story to pass the time. Well, will you please tell it quietly? (HE MOUTHS SILENTLY) (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...lived happily ever after, the end. I spy... with my little eye something beginning with... "B". - Quiet. - Or "J". - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - Quiet, please. B or J. B or J, easy. B or J. How can it begin with a "B" or a "J"? For various reasons, none of which I am at liberty to divulge. B or J. What's the answer? Ectoplasm. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Ectoplasm? Mr B. J. Ectoplasm. He works in my office. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But you can't see him! You can if you have an appointment. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - I can make myself disappear. - Well, why don't you go and disappear, then? I can disappear, make myself invisible. - Right, disappear. - I can't do it while you're watching me. Look over there. I've gone. I'm back. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I've gone. - I've gone. - Look, will you please just stop... INVISIBLE MAN: Once upon a time, there was a fairy prince and his name was Arthur Aldridge. And he got on a train, and a magic wizard gave him some cigarettes. Magic cigarettes, and he said to the wizard... He said... oh! Ah! Argh! Oh! Argh! (INVISIBLE MAN WHIMPERS) And they all lived happily ever after, the end. (FANFARE PLAYS) Hello. Last week, I showed you the lovely Aimi MacDonald dolly and the demand was so enormous. Just everyone wanted one. So, specially for you, we are now making them in different sizes and here they are. (MUSIC BOX MUSIC PLAYS) DOLLS: Lovely Aimi MacDonald is very, very lovely. Lovely Aimi MacDonald is very, very lovely. Lovely Aimi MacDonald is very, very lovely. Lovely Aimi MacDonald is very, very lovely. Lovely Aimi MacDonald is very, very lovely. They don't say very much but they certainly know what they're talking about. (FANFARE PLAYS) (PIANO MUSIC PLAYS) - Oh, uh, morning, sir. - Good morning. I want to buy a house-trained chartered accountant and I saw that you had some in the window. Oh, no, sir. They're not chartered accountants, actually. They're bank managers, sir. Very similar breed. Very popular. Oh, dear. That is a pity, you see, because I already have a chartered accountant a female one, you see, and I wanted to breed. Oh, well, I think you'll find bank managers make very good breeders, sir. - Really? - Yes, they're very, very popular. Do you want me to get one of 'em out the window and let you have a look? - If it's not too much trouble, yes. - Oh, no trouble at all. Come along. Come on, little boy. Come on, Reginald. Come on, boy! Down, boy! There he goes, aww! He's a frisky little fellow, isn't he? High spirited, sir. - Very frisky. - Oh, he's lovely, sir. Very nice. Up, boy! Come on, boy. Up! Up! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND APPLAUDS) - Very good. - Oh, he's marvellous, sir. Show the gentleman some of the tricks I taught you. Refuse the gentleman an overdraft. - (HE GROWLS) - Oh, very good. - You see? Good, isn't it? - Yes, yes. Now, how do we go when we're counting money, Reginald? - Isn't that good? - You've certainly trained him well, yes. He's beautifully trained, sir. - He's good at catching treats too. - He gets very sad if I leave him out, sir. Aw! He likes this, sir. He likes this. Look at his leg going like the clappers, look. - So they do. - Down, boy. Down, boy, down. Oh, uh... I think he wants to go walkies, sir. - Oh. - In a minute, Reginald. In a minute. - What's his pedigree like? - Oh, impeccable, sir. His father was a clergyman, mother managed a tea shop in the country. One of a litter of three. The other two are dentists, sir. Well, he certainly seems to have taken a fancy to me! Stop it! Stop it! Time of the year, y'know? They get a bit funny this time of... - Down! Down! - Well, I'll take him. How much? Oh, £4, 17 and six, sir. Oh, that's fine. Jolly good. Uh, here we are. - Only got a fiver, I'm afraid. - Oh, a fiver? Well, I'm sorry, I don't have anything smaller, sir. I don't have any change. Would you mind taking your change in traffic wardens? - No. - Only I don't have anything smaller. - That's fine. - Right, come on, boys. Come on. - Go with the nice gentleman. - Come along! Off you go! There we are then. Aww! I hate to part with them, you know, but I'm glad they're going to a good home. Aww... (FANFARE PLAYS) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Hello. As tonight is the final programme in the present series I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those backroom boys who have helped to make my show such a success. Particularly Tim Whatsit-Taylor Marty Thingamajig, What's-his-name Chapman and the tall one that needs a shave all the time. I would like to thank them for the way they filled in so well while I changed into my lovely costumes. But there is one person I would clearly like to single out as being the sole cause of the amazing success of the Aimi MacDonald Show. I would dearly like to tell you her name but she's so modest that she does not wish to be mentioned. And that person is me! - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - Can we have a big hand for me, please? (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Thank you so much! You're all so kind. Really, I don't deserve it at all. Thank you so much. Ah... Ooh! What a lovely surprise! Oh, isn't that beautiful! Wait a minute, I ordered roses! - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - Never mind, see you all again soon. - Bye, bye! - (FANFARE PLAYS) NARRATOR: Ladies and gentlemen for the very first time on television...
