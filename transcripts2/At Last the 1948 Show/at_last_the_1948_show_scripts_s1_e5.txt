Well, I've, uh, bought this farm and it seems that you three come with it. - It's all down here somewhere. - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Three hundred chickens, pigs four out-houses, Reuben, Dan and Willem, that must be you. Arrr. Well, from now onwards, I'm going to be in charge here so if you have any little problems, do bring them along to me. (HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH) Arr. (HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH) I'm awfully sorry, I didn't quite catch all that. Reuben and Willem were as saying as how one of the piglets down the four acre done hurt her trotter, sir. Oh, poor little thing. Will she have to be destroyed? I mean, she won't be much good for racing now, will she? - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - (HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH) (HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH) ALL: Arrr! - BRIGHTWELL: What was that? - Saying as how you don't race pigs, sir.

Uh, 'tis a sign of friendship in this part of the country, sir. Uh, Reuben... (HE SPITS) (HE RANTS GIBBERISH) (HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH) - He didn't seem to like that, awfully. - He'll be alright, sir. 'Tis just not used to strangers, sir. Uh, now would you like to give us our orders, sir? Orders? Um, yes... orders. Well, I've written one or two little things down here I want you to do. I want you to, uh, mow the corn and sheer the piglets. - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - How was that, sir? Well, that sort of thing anyway. No? Well, what should we be doing on the farm this month? It is March and that's got an "R" in it. I don't know if that's any sort of guide? - FARMERS: No, no. - No, no... Well, shouldn't you be spreading... spreading that stuff? Um, um... - Muck! - Oh, no, sir. Oh, no. We spread the potassium triphospho-oxynitro-acetate, sir. Arr! (HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH) (HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH) (HE LAUGHS) - Good God, what was that? - 'Tis an old country saying, sir.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And now... - Good morning. - Eh? - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. Good morning. I suppose you read quite a lot then? - I what? - I suppose you read quite a lot then? - Oh, yes. Quite a lot. - Ah. How about "The Wonderful World of the Ant"? - The what? - "The Wonderful World of the Ant". - Have you read it? - Uh, no. Oh! Why, is it good? (HE HOOTS) Good? (HE LAUGHS) - Well, what's so good about it? - Did you know? Did you know? Did you know? - What? - Did you know that the average ant, Johnny Ant has a brain 12 times the size of its own head? No. Brain, no! Human brain. Twelve times bigger than the human brain. Relatively speaking. Furthermore, he can carry a burden 3,000 times his own weight. Fantastic! - 3,000 times his own weight? - Yes, 3,000 times his own weight. Fantastic! - Well, that is fantastic. - Fantastic. Oh, wait a moment, three times his own weight. He can carry a burden three times his own weight. - Fantastic. - Three times his own weight? - Yeah. - That's not fantastic. No, it isn't, is it? Still, this means that four ants can carry a burden twelve times their own weight, say... a vole, a small vole, several yards. Relatively speaking. Further than you and I, for example, could carry a cow. Fifty thousand of them, say, could carry a cow further than you and I could carry Paddington station. - How about that? - Go away. Another thing... (HE SCREAMS) You know what that is? - No and I don't care. - I'll tell you what it is then. - No. - Have a guess then. - No. - Alright, I'll do it again. - No. - (HE SCREAMS) Now have a guess. - I don't know. - That is the mating call of a worker ant. Actually, it goes... (HE SCREAMS QUIETLY) But magnified a thousand times. (HE SCREAMS) Whereas the queen ant, which is 100 times larger goes... No, no, no! No, people are looking. No! (HE YELLS) How about that? - Please leave me alone. - What's this then? - I don't know. - What's this then? - I don't know! - Go on, do it, do it! - No, I feel silly. - Go on, do it! Look, it's easy, it's easy. Please don't make me. Alright, guess what it is then. - An ant. - Good, good, it's an ant. - What's he doing? - I don't know what he's doing! He's signalling! He's signalling! Easy, he's signalling, he's saying... "Give us an hand with this small vole." - He's what? - He's saying "Give us an hand with this small vole." - Wait a minute. - Yeah? How do you know he's saying that? - What? - How do you know he's saying "Give us a hand with this small vole"? I mean, it's so specific! "Yeah, come on, mateys, give us a hand with this small vole!" How do you know he's saying "Give us a hand with this small vole"? Well, I don't know. It might be anything. - You what? - It might be anything. You what? Well, I'm not a bloody ant, am I? How should I know what a bloody ant says? Who cares what a bloody ant says? - Well, you brought it up in the first place. - Shut up or I'll hit you. (HE WAILS) That is the death cry of a worker ant. - Now, you do it! - No. Yes, go on. Do it. (HE MAKES A PATHETIC NOISE) Rotten! What a rotten death cry of a worker ant! Rotten! Rotten! (HE WAILS) That's how it is. Whereas a queen ant, which is 1,000 times larger, goes... (HE SCREECHES) You do it! - (BRAKES SCREECH) - (TYRES SQUEAL) (MAN SCREAMS) That's it! That's it! That's quite good. Well done! (FANFARE PLAYS) Veni, vidi, vici. Do you know what I mean, darling? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) (IN SILLY HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): Hi-yah!

Give me a stick. - Now, don't move. - (SHE WHIMPERS) (HE THRASHES AND GRUNTS) Mary, please try to understand. To think that I trusted you all along. Oh, Mary. Don't reproach yourself now. - But Paul said... - Paul! Yes? Paul! I never want to hear his name again! Paul who? Paul Denning. Oh, Paul. Didn't he marry the Musgroves' girl? No, that was Archie Thompson. Keep Archie out of this. You know Archie's dead? - Dead? - Yes. He died in Bombay last week. But they haven't buried him yet. Why not? - The ground's too hard. - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So it's all over between us? Between you and I, I mean? - Between you and me, you mean. - Yes. - Yes. - Oh, John. It was all so lovely in Kuala Lumpur in the spring. Do you remember how we used to take the little native boys - to feed the crocodiles? - (HE LAUGHS) I always felt guilty about that. - So this is the end of us? - Yes. Oh, John. Once, we had something that was good and pure and wonderful. What's happened to it? You spent it all. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) You're riding roughshod over the ashes of my love. You can't be serious. Thank you. You might as well know... I'm having an affair with Chung Mi Fu Yung Toy. Keep Chung Mi Fu Yung Toy out of this! Which one is he?

Don't say that. Don't you see? It would never work, you know. We can't just start all over again, it would always catch up with us. (SHE SOBS) Oh, God! - Don't move! - Don't move! But John...
