 (FANFARE PLAYS) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Good afternoon. Good afternoon, ladies. It's lovely to see such a large audience here for this afternoon's discussion. The largest I think that any of us here can remember. The subject, as some of you may know, is pornography and up here on the podium to spark us all off well, the conversation off, we have Colonel Mainwaring-Thing who feels that censorship is absolutely essential and who has, of course, a wealth of experience in the field.

 As a colonel. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. And a psychiatrist, Dr Hennis Borden who feels that perhaps we should take a more liberal attitude towards this disgusting filth. Colonel. Well, what I have to say is perfectly simple. Pornography equals filth. Filth equals corruption, depravity, and the collapse of our society. - Here, here! - And that's a fact. Well, I'm afraid I can't agree with that, Colonel. You see, in my experience I have never yet found a person who I could say had been harmed by anything that they had read. Nonsense, nonsense! Well, look, I want to conduct a little experiment here this evening.

It's alright ladies, he is a doctor. - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - And, uh... we'll see if they have any effect at all. Thigh. Stocking top. Leather petticoat. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Firm young breasts.

(FANFARE PLAYS) NARRATOR: And now, here is an announcement in the public interest. Good evening. What I have to say concerns all dog owners. Please remember that a high-pitched whistle whilst inaudible to the human ear can be very irritating to your dog. Another good way to irritate them is to drop them in a bowl of treacle. - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - (FANFARE PLAYS) (PIANO PLAYS IN GILBERT AND SULLIVAN STYLE) (GLASS SHATTERS) 'Ello! 'Ello! 'Ello, 'ello!

Burglars, aren't you? - Yeah, that's right, yeah. - I thought as much. - What have you got in that sack, then? - Jewels, look! Burglars? Jewels? There's something fishy going on 'ere. Right, I must ask you to accompany me to the station. No. Right! Right! In that case... I must ask you... to remain 'ere. Right, leave this to me. 'Ello, what's going on 'ere then? We're robbing the shop. - Do you have the owner's permission? - Ask him, we're busy!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) (HURDY GURDY WALTZ PLAYS) (HURDY GURDY WALTZ PLAYS) (LIVELY JINGLE PLAYS) NARRATOR: Topic, a frank discussion of a controversial problem. This week, Franklyn Trevelyan talks to Dr Rhomboid Goatcabin about freedom of speech. Uh, Dr Goatcabin, what I want to ask you first... is do you believe that, in this country, there is freedom of speech? - Well, I always... - Or to put it another way... Do you believe that there is, in this country, freedom of speech? - Yes, well I think that... - To paraphrase a little... Do you believe that there is... - freedom of speech in this country? - In this country. Yes, I do. In other words, are people, in this country, free to speak? - Yes, well um... - That was what I mean. - Yes, um... - Perhaps I should say that by "free" - I mean of course, unrestrained. - Yes. By "speech", I mean the act of speaking words. - Yes, quite. And by "in this country", I mean, of course, Great Britain. - Yes, I do appreciate... - And Northern Ireland. - And Northern Ireland, yes. - And the Channel Islands. - Channel islands, yes, I... - But not, of course, abroad. - No, no. I do... - But, I mean... I mean, to what extent do you... - as opposed to anyone else... - Yes. - ...who would be other people... - I know the question. I do-do-do know the question. ...uh, feel. By "feel" I mean believe... - ...uh, consider, hold to be true... - I know the question! - ...credit to view, profess to believe... - I know the question! - ...maintain, assume... - I know the question! - ...surmise, accept, to deem, ween, or... - I know, I know, I know... - ...that this is in fact the case... - I know the question! Or not. - What? What, me? - Yes. - You want to know what I think? - That's right. - Really? - Yes. Well, I... I've forgotten the question! - Uh, freedom of speech. - Oh, yes, yes. - What I was asking was... - Well, I, I... - ...do you feel that freedom of speech... - I... l... - ...in this country is an illusion... - I remember the question! - ...or a reality? - I remember the question. - By "reality", of course, I do mean... - I remember the question. - (HE RAMBLES) - I do know the question! I remember the question! I do remember the question! - (HE RAMBLES ON) - I know it! I didn't want to come here! You made me come here! I didn't want to come! I'm going now. - ...an easy decision on a relative... - I'm going. ...as opposed to an absolute problem. When I say "problem", I do mean an issue that affects all of us at this time. I mean, I always, myself, feel that while it is universally agreed that some restriction on the right of free speech is necessary for example in the case of the law of libel... (TRUMPET AND DRUM SOUND) ...or not, as the case may be. I mean, bearing in mind that with censorship many of the facts that lead to a repression of a person's opinion can, in fact, lead, if bottled up, to extremely violent states of action though I do not personally believe it to be the case... ...as there seems to be little evidence to this effect. Well, I always feel... that in the case of freedom of speech one can only... - However, I'm afraid that's all that we have time for tonight. - Goodnight. - (GOATCABIN SCREAMS) - (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) - (FANFARE SOUNDS) (MAN WHISPERS): Cue! All I said was "Kiss me, Hardy". It's a bit bold, really, and it gives a lady such a bad name! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Balham High Street, please. - What are you doing on my back? - Balham High Street, please, single. - Please get off my back. - Oh, put me off at the Odeon. - What? - Oh, no, no, better... Better still, Perivale Road, the walk'll do me good. Will you please get off! Could we move off now, please? I'm a bit late. Uh, is this one going to Tooting? No, Balham. But you can hop off at Staveacre's Corner. - Oh, thank you. - Not at all. What is going on? I don't understand. We're full up on top now, so can we move off, please before the rush starts. It gets terribly crowded at rush hour, you know - and I do hate to have to stand. - Oh, I know. - What, more of you? - Yes, quick, here they come. - Quick, quick, quick! - Oh, my God! I'm going mad. I'm a 59 bus and I'm going to Balham! - Ding, ding, ding, beep, beep, beep, beep. - Pass along the man. Damn, missed him. Golders Green, please. (FANFARE PLAYS) A lot of people have written in to ask if I really talk like this. Well, I don't. I put it on for the show. (IN A GRUFF MALE VOICE): This is what I really talk like. Do you know what I mean, darling? (IN HER NORMAL VOICE): Oh! (FANFARE PLAYS) Hello. Well, now, let me remind you about one or two of our programmes later this evening. At 10 o'clock, there'll be another chance to see the second repeat of a repeat of a programme which was first repeated at half past nine. And then at half past ten there'll be a third chance to see a recording of a repeat of the first part of the sports report report on sport which is a repeat of the sports report report repeat reported by Peter Porter on the sports report, report. This is a repeat. Well now, it's almost half past eight and time for our live programme the 791st episode of our interminably popular serial "The Willetts of Littlehampton". (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYS) - Leo! - Sarah. - Leo, is it really you? - Yes. - (SHE SOBS) - After six years. Let me look at you, Sarah. You've hardly changed. Haven't I? How was Malaya?

I wonder if you would excuse us while we get on and read the letter? What ho, yes. Don't let us get in the way. I'm sure you're frightfully busy rehearsing your play whatnot. Jolly good, alright Jordanian party this way. I want you to see a boom microphone. They're rather fascinating, these. Fancy seeing Uncle Harry again, ha, ha, ha! Yes, isn't it amazing how interested he still is, in Arabs? Yes, and television. - Years ahead of his time. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. They're not are they? Oh, the letter, Sarah. I want you to read it, do you hear me, Sarah? I want you to read every word. It explains everything about that evening at Locksby about Teddy's suicide, about everything. Oh, my God. (SHE SCREAMS) Oh, Uncle Harry seems to have left one of his Arabian friends behind, Sarah. So he has! Go away... He's always... always doing things like that. Silly old Uncle Harry. Why don't you go and join Uncle Harry and your two friends in the garden? Um... Sarah, I want you to finish reading the donkey. - Um, the letter! - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I want you to read every word do you hear me? Every single word. And then I want to talk about us, Sarah.

Oh, Leo! - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - Then we're free to... - Yes, darling, Sarah. - Yes. - Oh, Leo! Darling, we're alone at last... Apart from Uncle Harry's friend. Sarah, it's been so long since we were together like this. Just the two of us... ...and an Arab. Oh, Sarah. I love you. Do you hear me? - I love you madly. - I love you too, Leo. (SARAH SCREAMS) Why don't you go fetch someone in the garden, Uncle Harry's friend? (SARAH SHRIEKS) Uh, Sarah... I'll go and fetch Uncle Harry. - Sorry to bother you again. - (SARAH SCREAMS) Seem to have lost one of my party. Ah, ah, there you are. I... oh, dear, um... Prince Abdul thing, we're moving on to Studio 2 now to see colour television now, you see. - This is a live production. - Live? Now? We're on the air? Not a rehearsal. Um... - Ah, there you are, Uncle Harry. - Ah, good evening, yes. Um, here I am, uncle Harry. Uncle Harry, here I am. Not the head of Drama. Not remotely like him. But as you so aptly put it, Uncle Harry. Jolly good. Good evening, I'm Uncle Harry. - Am I on the right camera? - Uh, yes, Uncle Harry. Yes, um... Yes, uh... Sarah and I want to be alone, Uncle Harry. I wonder if you would mind taking your Arabian friend for a walk in the garden. - In the garden? - Garden. Uh... oh, yes. Uh, oh, he's gone. Ah, well. it doesn't matter now, Uncle. Well, lovely to see you again, Uncle Harry. - Goodbye. - Oh, uh. Goodbye. And please give my love to Gladys...

Inshallah! Come with me now, Sarah, before it's too late. Quiet! I can hear someone coming. I think it's my husband! (AUDIENCE GIGGLES) Ah! So this is the way you treat me, Sarah! I leave you here alone... - except for the Arabs. - What? Except for the Arabs. I leave you hear alone, except for the Arabs, and when I come home what do I find? - Him! - It's no good, Mellish! Sarah knows about Sebastian's will. - What? - Yes, and Helley's suicide. I told her everything. - You mean, she knows? - Yes! I know that we're not legally married. - Don't say I didn't warn you, Leo. - (SARAH GASPS) Ah! - I'm going to kill you. - I'm Uncle Harry, you see. - Who? - And, uh... and the director told... No, I thought. I thought it would be a good idea if I asked my Arabian friends if they'd like to leave the studio, uh... the living room and make things easier for you, jolly good. (HE COUGHS) I don't care who's here, Leo. I'm going to kill you. - No, Lionel, no! - Keep away from him, Sarah! I'll give you three. One. - Two. - MAN: This way, Nigerian party! This is the studio. You may have seen some of it. - I appear to be interrupting something. - (WOMAN SCREAMS) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - DIRECTOR: You! - (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) - You! Out of my way! You bloody fool! You've ruined my whole bloody programme! (HE SOBS HYSTERICALLY) Hello, I'm so sorry, I... Is Leo mortally wounded? Will Lionel Mellish find the letter? Or will the head of children's programmes turn up with a load of flaming Eskimos? Don't ask me, we only do the bloody programmes. This way Eskimo party, this is one of our studios. That's the camera, if you'd like to have a look at that, there. That's a lens. You probably have the same sort of thing in your country. - You can see a red light on. - (DIALOGUE FADES) (HURDY GURDY WALTZ PLAYS)
