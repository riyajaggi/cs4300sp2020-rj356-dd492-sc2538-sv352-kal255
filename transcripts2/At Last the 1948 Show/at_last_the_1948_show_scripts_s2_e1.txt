CUSTOMER: I was passing by your shop and I noticed that you sell jokes and novelties and that sort of thing so I thought I'd buy one or two to amuse the family as it were, over the festive season. ASSISTANT: Certainly, certainly. Anything for a friend, how are you? - (SPRING BOINGS) - Ah, that made you jump, didn't it? - Hang on, 'ang on. - It did, a bit. ASSISTANT: Here we are. Hang on a moment, this will be worthwhile. It's worth waiting for. Hang on, we've got to get it right. Alright? How about that, then? CUSTOMER: What? ASSISTANT: The hatchet in me head. CUSTOMER: Oh, yes. Is that a joke or a novelty? ASSISTANT: Well, it's a joke innit? You say to your wife "What's wrong with me?". She says, "I don't know". You say, "I got a split personality". - Ha, ha, ha! - CUSTOMER: Aha. ASSISTANT: There we go. That didn't make you want to laugh, how about this one, then? Look, the electrical toilet seat, give your friends a shock. - CUSTOMER: No, I don't think so. - ASSISTANT: Plug it into the mains. Make the shock as strong as you like. Burn the flesh, eh? Burn the flesh! Eh? They won't take that sitting down. - Zee, zee, zee, zee, zee! - CUSTOMER: No, I think... - I think that's a bit too, uh... - ASSISTANT: Subtle? Yeah, how about this then? "Billy the biting telephone" you see. This'll test your sense of humour, look. Look at this. You set this spring here, you see? When Granny puts it to her ear... Clip! Bites right in the earhole. Argh! Guarantee it has to be removed surgically. Peals of laughter. Ha, ha! No, don't go away, plenty more. Look, luminous warts! Stick 'em on your face, they light up in the dark. Frighten the kids. - CUSTOMER: No thank you, I... - ASSISTANT: No, no, don't go away. - We got lots more. - CUSTOMER: No, I'd like something a little more, um... ASSISTANT: Sadistic? How about this? Look. The musical bandage. When you've wounded one of your guests tie this bandage on, you see? When the blood gets on it, it plays selections from The King and I or Sound of Music, or Onward Christian Soldiers as used by the Pope. Ha, ha. No offence, only a joke. Right, here we go, then. Look, loopy lugholes. - I don't know... - How do you like the loopy lugholes then? - Look at them, they're perfect... - Have you got anything that's... - not violent? - What? Something not violent. Oh, something crude? - No! - Yes, something crude. Look. Jokey Jock, Jockey Jock. - What's that? - Jokey Jock, the talking athletic support. - No! - Strap it on, it tells jokes. Surprise your friends. Mounted merriment. - No! - No? You don't laugh easily, do you? How about this? Look. "Cheeky Charlie Chocolate". Give a bit to your friends. What... what does that do? - Gives 'em cholera. - Cholera? Yes, cholera. Hey, have you got any pets? Well, actually, I've got a little budgie. A budgie, look, look, "Carole the Caustic Cuttlefish". - Blind your budgie, no mess. - No! No? Alright then, look. Here's a hatchet for your cat. Chop its head off, make the kids laugh. - What's funny about that? - Well, it's the unexpected, isn't it? And you've got your pathos with the cat and the slapstick and the blood. Very funny. - But it's just cruel! - And it's just cruel, right. Yes. Here we go, then. Look. "Percy the Poison". Put it in the water supply, kill the town, four and nine. No? No? Giant economy size, ten bob. - Wipe out Manchester. - CUSTOMER: No, no! Nothing like that. ASSISTANT: Oh, good, uh, how about disguises then? CUSTOMER: Oh, disguises that's much more it. ASSISTANT: I like a gentleman with taste. Look, look, what about this? This isn't easy, look, look, look... How about that? Disguise yourself... disguise yourself as a chartered accountant. - CUSTOMER: Oh, that's very good! - ASSISTANT: Do you like that? - CUSTOMER: How about a beard? - ASSISTANT: A beard, yes. A beard, "Hairy Herbert". "Hairy Herbert"? - CUSTOMER: No, a little bushier. - ASSISTANT: Bushier? "Fuzzy Fritz"? - "Fuzzy Fritz". That's the one. - (CUSTOMER GIGGLES) - CUSTOMER: Perfect! Absolutely perfect! - ASSISTANT: Do you like that? CUSTOMER: George Harris! Alias Ladislaw Vole-Wattle... I arrest you for the murder of the Luton Girls Choir. - ASSISTANT: You can't prove it! - CUSTOMER: Oh, can't I? (DRAMATIC CHORD PLAYS) - ASSISTANT: Alright. - (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) ASSISTANT: Alright, I admit it, but you'll never take me alive! (GUNSHOT) CUSTOMER: Don't look, it's not a pretty sight. GIRL: Is he... - CUSTOMER: Yes, Mrs Wattis, he is. GIRL: Hooray! CUSTOMER: So perish all enemies of justice. (WARBLING SOUND) - GIRL: Superbadger! - SUPERBADGER: The same. - (HE WHOOSHES) - (DRAMATIC CHORD PLAYS) (TRUMPET FANFARE PLAYS) Good evening. This is the high spot of the show each week when a well-known star entertains. This week it's me. Next week, it's me, too. Anyway, tonight I'm going to tell a joke. Ahem. There was this man... and his name was Knickers! - (SHE GIGGLES) - The end. - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Good evening, and welcome to the Nagwort Municipal Ballroom and Rabbi-greasing Institute in Bogmouth for the finals of the Gnome-fumbler trophy. Well, we've had a really exciting evening so far with the Archbishop of Reading's formation Old Time Horse-Knackering team taking the group honours. Well, you've joined us just in time for the all-comers medley and so, without further ado over to the floor. (1920's STYLE DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) Here we see Sonny Goatsbrain and Binny Mollusc. Sonny is an exploding boot mechanic from Huddersfield. Binny is wearing a startling creation in pink tulle embossed with 18,000 senna pods which were sewn on by her grandmother ex-heavyweight wrestling champion, Baudy Hardacre. Last year's champions Wally Armitage-Powerwater and Doreen Muff-Blaster run a 24-hour black pudding wash in Grimsby. Doreen is wearing a soufflé of shocking pink, corrugated iron with matching shoes, headband and rugby shorts which, unfortunately, we can't see. And now over to the judges for Sonny and Binny's score. Four point eight. Four point eight. Four point eight. Four point eight. Which makes a score of... quite a lot. - (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) - Well done, Sonny and Binny. And now over to the judges for Wally and Doreen's score. Four point eight. Four point eight. Four point eight... and four point eight. Which makes a score of... quite a lot, too. So it's a dead heat. Well done, Wally and Doreen. Isn't this exciting? And now for the first time on television, we're going to have a dance-off. (MUSIC RESUMES) Here's an interesting variation. I don't think we've seen that one before. (APPLAUSE)
