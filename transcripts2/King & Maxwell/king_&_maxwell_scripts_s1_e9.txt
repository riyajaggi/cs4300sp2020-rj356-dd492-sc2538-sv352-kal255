 You owe me 100 bucks. Good looks and a gracious winner, to boot. You're every girl's dream, Elliot. Coxswain Elliot, to you. Pay up, Sugar Sticks. Smile for the camera, Coxswain. Who the hell are you, pal? This is my partner, Sean. We're private investigators. Hired by the Eagleston Insurance Company. You remember them, don't you, Elliot? They're the ones that gave you 500 grand when you slipped and fell in that hardware store. Claimed you couldn't walk.

 Thanks to this video, you'll be going to jail for insurance fraud. Come on, who uses a helicopter? And by the way, my partner here... she let you win. Boo-yah. King & Maxwell 01x09 Locked In Original Air Date August 5, 2013 ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com Clarence is at my desk. First he takes out my side-view mirror. Now he's in my spot. A test dummy is secretly plotting to replace you? Seriously, who put him at my desk? Edgar? No, Sean. Don't look at me. Wait. Wha... Don't hurt your brain. Insurance-fraud case. Get money. Get paid. Sean, it's Wednesday. I'm just trying to, uh... Make grilled cheese? On Wednesday? I will, Edgar, I am just trying to find the, uh... Velveeta, fridge, second shelf. No, Edgar. I'm looking for evidence... A stolen auto part. Right place for everything. It's a steering wheel. I wanted to get it to Rigby to see if he could run it for fingerprints. Everything in its right place. What are you not telling me, Edgar? So many things. Where's the steering wheel, Edgar? Edgar? Kitchen cabinet with the other round things. Of course it is. Michelle? I'm gonna listen to it. That's awesome. That is so nice of you. - I'll see you tonight. - Okay, thanks. Who was that? Keith. He was just dropping off a mix cd. A mix cd. Isn't that a little bit high school? Not really any of your business. I'm just saying, he's a little young. He just has a youthful appearance. Whatever helps you sleep at night. Don't we have a steering wheel to get to Rigby? I think it's hiding with the plates. Deputy Director George Clark called. He said you got the green light for the Secret Service. Shh! Edgar! Please, keep your voice down. You should call him back. And I will, but for now, can we just keep it between you and me? I'm driving. I think I figured out why you're dating Keith. It's a mix cd, not a diamond ring. No, it's the same reason you always insist on driving... Same reason you're always accidentally opening my mail. You like to be in control. He told me how old he is, Sean. We're not that far apart in age. I will bet you a steak dinner Keith can't rent a car yet. Oh. It is on like Donkey Kong. Rigby. Oh, hey, Rigby. Hi. I'm Sean King. Michelle Maxwell. This is my boss, Adic Wallace. Assistant Director in Charge. King and Maxwell, the infamous disgraced Secret Service agents turned private detectives. Why are they here? We're just here to see our friend Rigby, sir. They're your friends, Agent Rigby? "Friend" is a strong word. Uh-huh. Bring Adams to holding cell 1. I'll be there in 20. I want his statement on a 302 before he goes to Capitol Hill. Just try and be a little professional. "Adic"? He's like the Rigby to your Rigby. What do you want, King? We've been hired to investigate a gang stealing auto parts from warehouses. We are talking thousands of dollars in merchandise being taken across state lines. We're in D.C. Everything is across state lines. We just need this run for fingerprints. You two have handled some explosive cases in the past, but wow. Steering-wheel thieves. You've really peaked. Come on, Rigby. We're on a deadline. Federal database could really help. Sorry, we've got a full plate. I'm protecting a very important witness... Way above your pay grade. In fact, technically, I shouldn't even let you look at him. Who, this guy? This guy right here? Hi, I'm Sean King. Uh... don't talk to them. It just leads to headaches and drinking and then more headaches. Check that steering wheel in to evidence. I'll get to it when I get to it. We knew we could count on you, Rigby. Please show yourselves out. Love you, too! Anyway, it's on like Donkey Kong. I'm so gonna win this bet. All right. One steering wheel for a 1970 Lincoln Continental Mark III. Thank you... Arnold. My pleash. Now, if you will just fill out these entry-log forms here... And these FD-92s. All three stacks. Right. If you want to know who set you up, you're gonna have to go back to the original evidence. Now, it's in a box locked in the FBI headquarters. You got this under control, right? No. Perfect. His name is Keith Ramsay. He's a pretty serious suspect in a pretty serious case. How serious? - Serious. - Seriously? Come on, Carter. I just need you to run the guy's name for me. Just basic stuff... Address, date of birth. In case you've forgotten, Sean, this is the FBI. We actually have serious cases. So you're not gonna help me out? Just don't tell Rigby. Ramsay... Is that "a-y" or "e-y"? Uh, can you run them both? No. Sorry, man. I can't. I can't help you. Not even for a steak dinner? - It's not worth it. - Michelle's buying. Not with Wallace around. What's with that guy? He hates Rigby. Why is that? Wallace looks great on the 6:00 news, but he can't hack it in the field. Rigby is an excellent field agent who can't stand playing politics. So Wallace sees him as a threat? One more strike, and Rigby's out. I didn't realize he had two strikes. With Wallace, Rigby started with two. Hey, thanks for leaving me, partner. Oh, paperwork's not good for my sciatica. You don't have sciatica. No, but it's a good word, isn't it? Well, I reached my daily limit of King and Maxwell about an hour ago. We've only been here for 10 minutes. Gunshot. Interview one. I left you alone for five minutes, Rigby. This place is on lockdown! Nobody in or out until we find out what happened in my building. Yes, sir. Well, I am on my way upstairs to navigate public relations. Next time I see you, this better be wrapped up with a bow. - Have I made myself clear? - You have. And lock these glorified rent-a-cops in a room and throw away the key. Give me a printout of the entry and exit log. Check all the firearms of any agents who accessed this floor today. You two, let's go. - You're holding us? - I don't have much choice, but now that you actually say it, it sounds like a great idea. Well, if you can't let us leave, then at least let us help you. - Nope. - Rigby. - No. - We're your friends. No, you're not. All your colleagues are suspects. Right now, we're the only ones you can trust. Rigby, this may come as a shock to you, but we're on the same team. Just don't stand too close to me. And despite these baseless accusations, Alvanta's commitment to excellence in our local community will not waver. Thank you. Clinton Grove, C.E.O. of Alvanta Chemical. As in Alvanta weed killer? And a host of other wonderful products. Our victim, Adams, was a former supervisor turned whistleblower set to testify at a Senate hearing today, confirming allegations that Alvanta knowingly poisoned a local water supply in Bellville, Maryland. Chemical runoff from the plant, polyditrate. It's a carcinogen. Six people are already dead, including countless livestock. While the C.E.O. drinks bottled water and cashes his stock options. FBI has the file. Why kill Adams? File's useless without corroboration. He was the linchpin of our case. When's the hearing? Six hours. It's the last Senate hearing before the August recess. Month break will give Alvanta a chance to cover their tracks. So we help you track down who killed Adams and find a new whistleblower. I got a dead witness here. Why stick out your necks? We care about the truth, Rigby. Alvanta thought they could get away with this, and people got hurt. Unlike the Secret Service, we get to choose our cases, which is this one. I know just the guy to help. Sean? Sean gone. Oh, hey. Hot water's out at my place. Just need to take a quick shower. - It's Wednesday. Sean makes... - Grilled cheese. On Wednesday, but he didn't. I'll make you grilled cheese, Edgar, but shower first, then food. I've already showered, with conditioner, for a smooth and healthy shine. No, Edgar. I'm going to shower, then I'll make you food. Not food... Grilled cheese. Edgar? Hey, we might be out for a little while. A little while... A figure of speech meaning a few hours at most. Edgar, I need you to find somebody for me... Somebody important. A whistleblower. Edgar? Can you bring me my loofah? It's on the desk! Who's that? Benny's in the shower. Hold, please. Benny's in the shower? Thank you, Edgar. You're welcome. Killer came in from the stairwell, propped open the door, walked down the hall, shot Adams, then left. He knew the door would block the camera. You got a real racket going with that candy machine. Ate my dollar twice. So, I got Edgar and Benny combing through Adams' e-mails, see if he confided in anyone so we can find you a new whistleblower. What are you two watching? Security-cam footage from Adams' room. Shooter was just outside the range of the camera. Different place, same tactic. Preliminary ballistics just came in. The round that killed Adams was a .40-caliber Coyote, 180 grain. Coyote? It's Russian made. I protected a diplomat in Kiev three years ago. It's a favorite of the Russian mob. - Perfect. - What? We have a Russian mobster in the building... Ivan Raslov. Works stateside as a low-level enforcer. In the building? He's a confidential informant. Alvanta has a plant in Russia. Could've hired Ivan to kill Adams. Room 5. He's scheduled for an interview in 10 minutes. It's possible he stole a gun from an agent. Highly unlikely. Let me get this straight. You have a Russian mobster in the building? And now he's gone missing. How the hell did Raslov get out of the building? There was a five-minute window before the lockdown... enough time to slip out. I just called MPD, had them get units out to local airports and train stations. We have less than five hours. This son of a bitch could be making a play to get back in good with the Bratva... Show he's still got some backbone. This is interesting. Yellowing of the fingernails? - He's probably a smoker. - Got jaundice. Smoker. I think your boy Ivan has a little nicotine problem. What? Just one Cuban. This Clinton Grove guy sounds like a real ass clown. - Ass clown. - Six dead, animals are dying. Ass clown. The worst part is, he knew they were doing it. Shazam. A decoy. Find something in the dead whistleblower's e-mails? E-mail from ciCHlid721@idermail.com. Account created in John Marshall Library. Public library. A dead end. Shazam! A decoy. And you already knew that. "Thanks for your bravery. "You're doing the right thing. Sincerely, a friend." So, whoever wrote this supports the cause but wants to stay hidden. The "C" and the "H" are capitalized. Maybe they're initials. Check it against... C.H. matches 600 Alvanta employees. Number one... Chris Howard, Regional Manager. 6701 Squire Lane, Falls Church, Virginia. Phone number... 922-63... Wait, wait. Um, what about "cichlid"? Cichlid. Pterophyllum scalare, commonly known as angelfish. Check it against the matching employees. "Fish Food Confidential"... A blog for the home-aquarium enthusiast, created by Christine Hayward. Assistant to Grove, C.E.O. of Alvanta! - Good work, Edgar. - I know. If anyone's got dirt on Alvanta, it's her. Sean cuts it diagonally. Oh. Sean makes it with jalapeños. Our Russian mobster says he got here on time, signed in with security, but his case agent wasn't here, so he went out for a smoke. Case agent got stuck outside the building before lockdown. And Sean was right... This thing just stole four bucks from me. All right, I think coins are gonna work. I cannot stress this enough... We have three hours until the Senate hearing. The faster we solve this, the faster you two can not be here. Happy? Yeah. E.R.T. confirms that none of the collected weapons were fired. So it wasn't one of ours. I want to see that security footage again. All we got was a muzzle flash. Yeah, I know. All right, can you play that again? There. Can you punch in on that? Can you play that? There it is. Broken pieces. Something else came out of that barrel besides a bullet. E.R.T. would've already vacuumed for trace evidence. See, Rigby? This isn't so bad. Us, you, here together, working a case... Like a team. Not for long. This one's going back to her old life - at the Secret Service. - What? Didn't she tell you? Tell me what? Uh, Deputy Director George Clark said he'd pull a few strings, but I haven't decided yet. And you told Rigby before me? Don't get sand in your speedo, King. I heard it through the Federal grapevine. I was gonna tell you. - When? - Soon... ish. I was waiting for the right time. Wait, what is that? Plastic. Exactly. We need to see that bullet wound. Same plastic. None of the sidearms on the floor were fired. Polymer shards in the carpet and the bullet wound. We're looking at a plastic gun. Impossible. The entryway body scanner picks up metal and plastic. It would've been caught. What if the gun was already here? Wait a minute. We had a bust a few months back... A counterfeit ring. Their entire stash is in the evidence lockup, including a 3-d printer. Arnold. Arnold. Arnold?! It's Agent Rigby! Just want to ask you a few questions. Arnold! Arnold? Up there! Where are you going, Arnold? Power saw's a nice diversion. This is what happens when you work with civilians. No offense. Frank. You're gonna want to see this. Printing file for a plastic gun. Where's the gun, Arnold? I don't know what you're talking about. I want a lawyer. You know, any other day, you could have one. I don't know if you heard... we're on a lockdown. Nobody in or out... that includes lawyers. So, for the time being, you're mine. I might keep you in this room for a couple of days, with this one for company. This says you applied to be an agent... twice. Were denied both times. As I understand it, two times is the limit. So your dreams of making agent are over. You wanted to be a part of the club. Nobody took you seriously. Gives you an ax to grind with the Bureau, doesn't it, Arnold? What do you think, Agent Rigby? Where's the gun, Arnold? All you've got is me trying to climb through a ceiling tile... Agent Rigby. Any luck finding the gun? Agents are still searching the floor, but so far, nothing. You get anything out of Arnold? Nothing to write home about. That gun did not walk out of here. What if it did? When we came in this morning, I saw the mail guy making his rounds. Your keen powers of observation? What time does the mail go out? First pick-up is at 11:00. Right after the shooting. But the truck couldn't have made it out of the building before lockdown. It should still be sitting in the parking garage. Get the mail bags up here... All of them. Any luck finding our Alvanta assistant? Christine Hayward's final Alvanta pay stub was mailed to 356 North Spring Street, Gaithersburg, Maryland. So she quit. She still live there? Last water bill in her name dated 92 days ago. No current address. Looks like she took a trip, got out of Dodge. That's a lot of clothes. You're taking a trip, too. Getting out of Dodge. All right. My hot water isn't out. Shazam. A decoy. I've been avoiding my apartment. There's this... guy. You know when you meet somebody and it's all hot and heavy for a week and then he starts getting needy and making you breakfast? I feel trapped. Benny in a box. Benny in a box! I don't know how to break it to him. Her glasses. Her glasses! I've helped a lot of people disappear... change their identities. People can change a lot. What's the one thing they can't change? Deoxyribonucleic acid. Yes, their DNA. And their medications. Bring up Christine Hayward's medical records from Alvanta. See? There. She has a prescription for corticosteroids... Mold allergy. Cross-check that with her eyewear prescription. Christine Wilson. 7637 Kensington Avenue, Takoma Park, Maryland. So she changed her name and moved. Now let's find her phone. Wait, wait. Does opening mail in the FBI building make it a double Federal offense? Look familiar, Arnold? It should. It's got your prints all over it. Working in evidence, you had access to all the informants' identities. Figured Ivan would be a good guy to frame because of his mob ties, so you used a Russian-made bullet. Can't sneak a gun into the FBI, so you did it the only way you knew how... by making one in the evidence room. But your badge number didn't show up in the entry log. You've been here long enough that people trust you. Probably as simple as having a co-worker hold open a door for you. They were gonna kill me. Who? Alvanta? No, the... Drug dealers. Look, I-I owe a lot of money. Oxy... I-I can't, uh... I can't quit. And this guy told me that he'd... he'd take care of all my debt, and all I had to do was handle a problem for him. Either Adams died or I did. And I chose him. Who? What guy? - He didn't tell me his name. - You never met him? He came by my place once. Scary-looking guy with a high and tight haircut, tattoos... a guy you don't want to mess with. Probably an Alvanta contractor. They found your weak point and squeezed... Took care of your drug debt in exchange for solving their whistleblower problem. It's Edgar. You're coming with me to the hearing. I can't do that. All you have to do is sit there, tell them what you know, and buy us some time. Your cooperation's gonna look good for the judge. Lockdown's over. We have our shooter. Edgar and Benny found a potential whistleblower. Christine Hayward... they're tracking her cell. I'll assemble a team to take Arnold to capitol hill. Meet me back here with Ms. Hayward. Benny says she might take some convincing. The hearing's in 90 minutes. Talk fast. Which one's yours? Uh, pink shirt. Oh, she's giving those boys a run for their money, huh? Let's hope she keeps fighting them off. Guess it's a good thing you guys don't live in Bellville. Excuse me? A lot of kids getting sick there. What do you want? I'm Sean King. I'm a private investigator working with the FBI. Alvanta, Clinton Grove... They shouldn't be allowed to walk away from this. You have an opportunity to set things right today. They... they already threatened me once. It's why I had to get away. Please, just let me raise my daughter. I spent a lot of years running away. And I spent a lot of years thinking about what I could have done. Christine. Hiding from the truth is not worth it. Trust me. Aah! Man down! Man down! From the northeast! Get some men up on that roof! Rigby! Let's go. Clear! Clear! Rigby. Rigby. He's not breathing. A vest?! Rigby, you're wearing a vest? Are you even hurt? Yeah. I got the wind knocked out of me. Were you gonna tell me before or after mouth to mouth? Oh, my God. You totally tried to pull a "Sandlot" on me. What? The movie? Squints, Wendy Peffercorn, fake drowning? Never mind. Where was my vest? Standard procedure... Priority targets only. The area's been secured. They found a gun. Shooter's gone. And I'm fine, too. Thanks. I knew you had a vest. And you almost let me... Get Sandlotted? What on earth are you people talking about? First bullet pierced Arnold's vest, caught his shoulder blade. Paramedics are on their way. No hearing for him, then. So much for stalling for time. - Sean? - Got her. We're on the move. Perfect. We'll meet you there. Sean's on his way with Christine. - Agent Rigby! - Sir. I was sure today couldn't get any worse, and I see you have proved me wrong. I just took a bullet, sir. You put yourself in harm's way, Agent Rigby, with wanton disregard for assignment or procedure. I was transporting a witness. - You were hijacking a case. - Excuse me? Your assignment was to protect the witness, not facilitate a congressional hearing! This is all over now. We'll wait for the hearing to be rescheduled. What is your damage, Wallace? Watch your tone, agent. Adams was murdered to keep the truth from getting out. I intend to see that his death was not in vain, with or without your support. Just don't expect your job to last the day. Well, that was fun. I'd like you to meet Christine Hayward. Christine, this is my partner, Michelle Maxwell. Agent Frank Rigby with the FBI. Hello. Thank you for your bravery in stepping forward, Ms. Hayward. - Sean, things have changed. - What do you mean? Adic Wallace has decided that the hearing is not the bureau's top priority. - So the case is dead? - Anything but. FBI may be out of the game, but Christine is getting to the hearing. So, this is you asking for help. Yeah. You kind of suck at it. Yes. I need your help. Just fingerprint that steering wheel... we'll call it even. This doesn't mean you're getting invited to my birthday party. You sure you're ready for this? No. But I know I'll regret it if I do nothing. Shooter's still out there. They're gonna be watching your every move. How much time do we have? 30 minutes. I came prepared. I really think I should be driving. You are master of the sea. I am master of the road. I'm pretty sure I'm master of both. See, you just... you can't stand not being in control. No. I'm just a better driver than you are. You see, all this ties into you dating Keith. This has nothing to do with Keith. This has everything to do with Keith. Would you just focus? Okay, I am focused like a laser. I've got tunnel vision. No, Sean. You shouldn't have tunnel vision. You should have peripheral... Go! Drop the gun! Don't move! Hands behind your back. You just got fooled by a dummy, dummy. Hey, Carter, this one's for you. All right. Let's move. You sure you didn't plan that so Clarence would end up in pieces? I told him all about the risks, but he insisted on playing the hero. Rigby. Did Christine make it to the hearing? She's being sworn in right now. By the way, Keith Ramsay... Born March 28, 1983, 30 years old. Boom! Chop house on 7th. It's a good thing I replaced the side-view mirror, huh? You just have to park it against a wall. Ding, ding, ding, ding. Supper's ready. Nice work, Edgar. I know. I made them with extra jalapeños. Thanks for telling me now. Welcome. My sister used to fold my pants wrong. I like them folded in half... Twice. Two times. Folding's... good. I told her... that I didn't like it. It's good to tell the people you live with the truth. I'll keep that in mind, Edgar. I think I have whiplash. He barely tapped us. You call that a tap? If I had been driving, we wouldn't have got in an accident. Yeah, whatever helps you sleep at night. Don't start that again. Hey. Maybe we shouldn't let Edgar see Clarence like this. I agree. Christine Hayward's testimony delivered a crushing blow in the Alvanta Chemical Senate hearing earlier today. Clinton Grove had complete knowledge that he was poisoning the Bellville water supply. Early toxicity reports were presented to him a full year before anyone got sick. I have no comment. There's no comment. The FBI's quest to bring some justice to the good people of Bellville has been unwavering. Through our efforts, we were able to expose the criminal activities of Alvanta Chemical. It is our mission to ensure that tragedies of this nature do not happen again. "A dick" indeed. That was Rigby. What did he say? He just wanted to thank us for giving Wallace the perfect excuse not to fire him. Rigby said that? That's what he meant. It sounded more like, "I've seen enough of you two to last me the rest of my natural-born life." So... This Secret Service thing... I know. I should have told you. No, no. I just, uh... I didn't know you wanted to go back. Yeah. I think it would be good for me. Have you made up your mind? Not yet. Still thinking about it. How long are you gonna think about it? I don't know. A little while. A figure of speech meaning a few hours at most. - What? - Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow, Sean. Yeah. I will see you tomorrow. Who wanted you blind, Sean? I was blinded. You were deliberately distracted. That's not the work of a lone gunman. That's a conspiracy. Who wanted Clyde Ritter dead? If you want to know who set you up, you're gonna have to go back to the original evidence. Now, it's in a box locked in the FBI headquarters. ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com
