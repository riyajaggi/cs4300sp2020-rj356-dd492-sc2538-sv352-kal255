 You've got no right, Jimmy! - Not after the things you did. - What did I do Denise? Go on! Tell your naked friend! Sir, I'm gonna give you your massage, okay just two seconds. - Get out of here Jimmy! - Or what? Or I'll break this over your head! Go ahead! - You ruin everything Jimmy! - You ruin everything! You ruined my cousin's Quinceañera! - I don't even know what that is! - You need aroma therapy! - I don't know what that is! - You don't know what anything is! You could have just given the guy a massage. He would have been so relaxed he never would have spotted the fake. This plan worked out better for me.

 Our client will be very happy to get her watch back. It's the Secret Service. It's about my reinstatement interview. - Michelle Maxwell. - I'm gonna give you a minute. ♪ Here you go Edgar. Yahtzee! The case of the purloined watch is closed. Now there's a Hardy Boys book I missed. I was always partial to Nancy Drew. Wanna talk about the elephant in the room? I don't want to put you on the spot. There's a reason I became a rower. I like straight lines, going from here to there. It's how I've lived my life. Being a private investigator was never on that line. You think it was on mine? I was in the Secret Service a lot longer than you. Exactly. You had your career. Mine was taken from me. Sounds like you already made up your mind. No, not yet. Look I just... I wish you had told me about the interview, that's all. We shouldn't keep secrets from each other. Okay. No more secrets. I gotta run. The mail... Has arrived! Who's it from? Doesn't say. But it's addressed to me. Uh-uh, does the name Ted Kaczynski mean anything to you? Unabomber. Relax guys, it's not ticking. It doesn't need to tick to be a bomb. What is it? This is the evidence box, from the Clyde Ritter assassination. Sean, this box needs to go back to the FBI. Why? Because last time I checked, possession of stolen property is a crime. Don't be such a buzz kill. You didn't notice that, on the shooter Sean? As a Secret Service Agent you're trained to look for two things for a possible threat. The eyes, and the hands, when I saw the assassin his hands were at his side. His real arm was curled up under his jacket holding a gun. William Conrad Philips arrest record "petty theft, and heroin possession". Page 418. The Ritter Commission Report. Don't believe everything you read Edgar. That report is a work of fiction, the truth is in this box. Look at these, these are data cards from eye witness video cameras. E-pins... This is Phillip's toxicology report. He wore this pin Sean? We all did, all the Secret Service agents, and the members of the Ritter family. They give total access. One is missing. What? 14 on the Secret Service detail, thee in Clyde Ritter's family. 17 e-pins, there are 16... - In that bag. - The protectee doesn't wear one. Didn't count... Him. Who you calling? Bob Scott. He was set up just like me. - Hello? - Bob. It's Sean, I've got something on the Ritter case. Text me where, and I'll meet you. - Okay. - Sean? Sean, this box has to go back to the FBI. Not till I talk to Bob Scott. Not much of a phone guy are you? Can't be too careful. So what's the big news? I got it. The box of evidence from the Ritter assassination. - How? - The mail. Mystery donor. That's not sending up any red flags? Maybe, but right now we need to go through that evidence piece by piece. - We? - We were both played. I was blinded, you were distracted by a voice in your ear piece. Don't you want to know the truth? - What did you find so far? - There's a missing e-pin. Any idea why? We both know who was in charge of distributing them. The voice that distracted me was a woman. - Someone took your sunglasses. - You're... you're... Talking about someone we trusted. We're talking about somebody you can't be objective about. I know her. There's another explanation. Call me after you've exhausted those. Then I'll come back to D.C. Hey, if we do this again, maybe we should bring a canoe, make a day out of... You all right? Bob was in the truck? Someone must have tailed him, triggered it remotely. And all this happened after you talked to him about the assassination? You coming over to my side? When did I ever say I wasn't? You're a long way from the beltway. You know I get a call whenever you almost get blown up. We had a break-in at the FBI this week. Someone wearing a janitor's uniform, used a stolen key card to access the evidence room archives. Do you know anything about that? Why ask me? It's the physical evidence from the Clyde Ritter assassination. - I didn't steal it. - I'm gonna say this once. If the box shows up in my office in 24 hours, I won't press charges. If the box happens to magically appear, you'll be the first to know. Oh, I better be. Excuse me. What's going on? Someone wants me to find the truth. Or set you up. I'm sorry about Bob. He was never the same after we covered up Bradley Martin's death. You can draw a straight line from that moment to where he ended up. Living alone in the middle of nowhere. It was a drug overdose, Sean. You did that to protect Bradley's family. Come on. You heard what Rigby said. "Return the box in 24 hours". I will. Edgar, what have you got? I got lots of things. I keep them in this bag. Yesterday I got a state spoon... Delaware. Edgar. Edgar. I'm talking about the eyewitness videos. There were 19 data cards collected from the video cameras at the Ritter assassination. Yes, and can you stitch them together? What am I looking for? Anything that makes you say, "hot damn". Okay. Benny. Tell me about the arm. It's prosthetic, very lifelike, very pricey. - Which is weird. - Why? The story... this guy, Philips, he was a pickpocket who used the arm as part of his trade, right? Right. Why would such a low-level thief use something this expensive? Is there any way to trace where it came from? Glad you asked. There was a serial number on the joint. - Well, that's great. - There was. - It's been filed off. - Of course it was. But I'm not done yet. I think I can recover it. - Using plate restoration. - You remember your counterfeiting. I don't even want to know why you still have all this stuff, Ben. What are you doing? U.S. currency used to be printed using plates. When plates wore down, they were decommissioned and destroyed. But enterprising counterfeiters would fish them out of the trash. They were able to restore the plates using an acid solution. Just like this. Oh, Benny, that is beautiful. Edgar, can you trace a serial number? - That's my bowl, Sean. - I'll get you another one, Edgar. Sean, can I talk to you? Give that number to Edgar. - It's my bowl for soup. - No, I... a brand-new one. Don't want a brand-new one. Want my bowl. 0-0-1-7... 4-6-2-3. Okay. So, the Ritter assassination story was full of lies. - Thank you. - But you can't do this alone. Whoever's behind this killed Bob Scott. You could be next. - I can take care of myself. - Sean... You have to go to the FBI. I can't trust the FBI. Hot jambalaya! The serial number? Traced to Sand's Props and Backing. 22 Whitehorse Street, Wilmington, North Carolina. - A movie-prop house. - Movie-prop house. If you don't want to come with me, I understand. We got about, you know, three, four of these up here, half a dozen in the back. Heck, you could open your own hospital. Just take a look around, and you'll find whatever you need. - Good afternoon. Are you the owner here? - Yes, I am. Gary Sand. - Mister... Vole? - Call me Leonard. This is Christine Helm. We're attorneys for the Jensen Prop Gun Company. We're here about the recall. What recall? Well, uh... There've been reports... uh, isolated reports... That some of the guns manufactured by our company may... Under certain, very narrow circumstances. Discharge improperly. We rent these guns. What do you mean, "discharge improperly"? Boom! They explode. They blow up in the actors' hands. Is this really how it's gonna be, Christine? There's no way to sugar-coat this, Leonard. For God's sakes, Treat Williams nearly lost a finger. We're going to need to see your billing records for the last 10 years. We want to be sensitive to our vendors, but to be honest, if we don't track down these prop guns, your whole company could be held liable. Right this way. Do you really think we'll be able to track the prosthetic arm back to whoever's behind the Ritter assassination? It's our only lead right now. If some cabal of Wall Street bankers or enemies of the Ritter family are really behind this, wouldn't they have covered their tracks by now? Groups like that work from the top down. My guess is that the actual killing was subcontracted out to a pro. And for someone like that, filing down the serial number on the arm might have been enough. You found a match? An invoice dated one month before the assassination. The arm was paid for in cash, never returned, rented to a... Roland Clay. Probably an alias. Wait a minute. What? Did I miss something? Excuse me. Do you still carry these? Yeah, they're just over there. But what do they got to do with the prop gun? I need you to find me one of those now, please. Okay, hang on. - What's going on? - Michelle, they were here. They got everything here. Here you go. Hand held, battery-operated Xenon bulb. Mounts anywhere. I need to take this. - Hey, you got to pay for it. - Send us a bill. Hey! - Can I please talk to Sean the lawyer? - What are you talking about? Sean the lawyer would have come back here with cops and a warrant, not run out with illegally seized evidence. Michelle, I'm not just trying to solve an eight-year-old murder here. I'm trying to prevent one from happening tomorrow. What murder are you trying to prevent? Clyde Ritter's son, Brady. He is announcing his run for Senate tomorrow in the same spot his father was gunned down. What makes you think the people who killed Clyde Ritter are now targeting his son? Because he's running on his father's platform... Bank reform, a freeze on foreclosures, massive defense cuts. Even if that's true, what makes you think they'll strike tomorrow? Is there another explanation for Bob Scott, for this? Yes! That you're getting too close to the truth about Clyde Ritter. That's it. Michelle, I am not letting this happen again. Eight years ago, my father came here to give a speech. It was about guiding principles. You see, dad... dad thought everybody should have one word that summed them up. Told you who they were, what they stood for. Back then, my word was "party". Afterward, um... they gave me a speech, and I read it. And I knew I needed a new word. The word I chose was "service". I didn't want to disturb you. No, it's okay, uh... Sean, it's always better with an audience. Please, come on in. Taken the day of the assassination. That's why I'm going back. Sir, you have to cancel. It isn't safe. I told you before, Sean, that I've heard all the conspiracy theories. It was a theory. Not anymore. King, I'm drafting a search warrant for your office. If I don't get that evidence box back, I'm gonna turn your life upside-down. If that's all true, then I'm even more determined to make that speech. Why would you say that? If I start my campaign scared, that's how I'll finish it. And I'll lose. This isn't about winning or losing, Sir. If you step up to that podium, I believe someone is going to try to kill you. I got the best security team money can buy. - Who? - Executive Defenses. I know them. Founded by former Secret Service. Who's leading the team? Joan Dillinger. - What did Brady say? - He's going through with his speech. I couldn't talk him out of it. Hot damn. Did you find something, Edgar? You said e-pins give total access. Define "total access". It means they can go anywhere without being searched. Clyde Ritter's killer is wearing one. Show me. The official story was that William Conrad Philips got in through an unguarded door. Page 782 of the Ritter Commission Report. I know that report is full of lies, but how could anybody miss this? Here's how. Look. He ditched the pin as soon as he got inside. - Good job, Edgar. - I know. This was an inside job, Sean. That explains the missing pin. Who issued the e-pins that day? I don't remember. Well, then, that's something for the FBI to find out. - I'm bringing this back. - No, you can't. It's time to tell the FBI what you know. Let them do their job. Oh, spoken like a true Secret Service Agent, so, you made up your mind? My interview is today. - I'm taking this on the way. - Michelle, please. Promise me you won't tell Rigby anything about any of this. - What? - Michelle... You're the only person I can trust right now. She's leaving. Yeah, that's right, Edgar. She's leaving. She's not coming back. I can't talk about any of that right now. I need you to do something for me. I need you to find out everything you can about a company called Executive Defenses. - Why, Sean? - Because I lied to Michelle. I know who issued those e-pins. You trust her. You lied to someone you trust. Why? Because the person who issued those pins was someone else I trusted. It was Joan Dillinger. You said no questions asked, right? Off to an interview? I only ask because I'm not so sure the Secret Service is such a great place to work. Toxicology report just came back on Bob Scott. He had an unusual drug in his system. Temazeline? What is it? No idea. But I'm starting to ask a lot of questions. You got any answers for me? Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. Good luck. - Edgar. - Sean lied. What? He said, "I remember who issued the e-pins". "It was Joan Dillinger". He said he thinks she's going to kill Brady Ritter. Okay. Where is Sean now? Joan Dillinger's firm owns a secret warehouse. I found it. I'll call Sean, but I need to ask you about the evidence box. It had the assassin's toxicology report in it, didn't it? Yes. What did it say under "drugs found in system"? Under "drugs found in system," temazeline. Temazeline. That's the same drug found in Bob Scott's body. Edgar, I need you to find me everything you can about that drug. Sean. What are you doing here? I know what this is. This is a rehearsal area... For Brady Ritter's assassination. What? Who are you working for, Joan? Are they behind Executive Defenses? Was that your payment... - For a job well done? - Sean, it's time for you to leave. I know everything... How you gave the assassin an e-pin. And that night before... when we were together... You took my sunglasses. That's how they blinded me. You were the voice in Bob Scott's earpiece. None of that is true... not one word. Except this. Yeah, this is a rehearsal area to protect Brady Ritter. I'm running maneuvers with my team according to Secret Service protocol. Look. There's the safe room. There's the exit route through the basement tunnel. That is what's going on here. I trusted you. - That was my mistake. - You need help, Sean. Don't come near Brady Ritter. I'm only gonna warn you once. Okay. Thanks. Director's just finishing a call. He'll be just another moment. Thank you. Edgar, did you find anything out about the drug found in the assassin? Temazeline... used by the former Soviet Union on dissidents in brainwashing experiments. The Ritter Commission Report said the assassin was a drug addict. Page 418 to 420. Why did he have a brainwashing drug in his system? I'm sorry about Bob. He was never the same after we covered up Bradley Martin's death. It was a drug overdose, Sean. Miss Maxwell? The Director will see you now. - And that's room 313. - Thank you. Sean? Edgar. Sean's gone. He took his gun. I need you to hack me onto the guest list of Ritter's announcement right now. Is Sean in trouble? Edgar, am I on the list? Edgar? Michelle, it's Benny. Edgar can't talk now. He's busy forking process daemons so he can malform a dot-host registry. Oh. So, that's good? I mean, is that progress? Ar-Arnold Palmer. Yes! Does that mean I'm in? I think he's thirsty. You're not on the list. There must be some mistake. Can you please check again? Sorry. I must have missed it. Through the metal detector, please. Perimeter clear. Don't make me shoot you, Sean. You left the door open for me. Yeah. I didn't want you to make a scene at the entrance. Why are you doing this? I'm not doing anything except protecting Brady Ritter. I want to believe that, Joan. Well, until you do, you're a threat I have to neutralize. Riley, detain him until local P.D. arrives. Oh! How did you find me? Joan's not in the Secret Service anymore. She's on an open frequency. - We have to stop her. - Sean, I think you got this wrong. Joan Dillinger wasn't in on the assassination. It was Bob Scott. - Bob Scott? - It started in Mexico. He had Bradley Martin killed with an overdose of a brainwashing drug. - Did you ever see the Tox report? - Never. - Bob had it... - Redacted. I know. Sean, I think he was trying to turn that poor Agent into an assassin. - For Clyde Ritter? - Maybe. The same drug was found two years later in Ritter's assassin and then again in Bob Scott. If that was Bob Scott. Dental records won't confirm it for days. Plenty of time to disappear. Ladies and gentlemen of Virginia, your next Senator! Brady Ritter. Two possible hostiles at grid three. Go, go, go! You have a visual on the shooter? Shots came from over there. I don't smell cordite. Maybe there never was a shooter. The shots were recorded? Why? He was never gonna strike at the event. He's a Secret Service Agent. - He's gonna do it on the escape route. - I think I know where Bob is. Wait. What if you're wrong? - The limo. - I'll check it out. You don't have a gun! - Are you injured? Any pain at all? - No. Just a little shook up. Yeah. I'm gonna keep you safe. Sean King came to see me. I saw him in the crowd. Yeah. He's not the gunman, but we're gonna treat him as a threat. We're clear. We're gonna take you down the tunnel to the limo, okay? - Okay. - Just follow my lead. I'll be right behind you. Don't move! Hands behind your back! - Sean, get behind me! - Get your protectee and get out of here! I'm not leaving without you. Do your job! Bob! Cops are gonna be coming down that ramp any second. No, they won't. They'll wait for the SWAT guys. I'll be long gone by then. I'm not gonna let that happen. You're wounded and unarmed, Sean. I saw Joan take your gun upstairs. Then why don't you tell me who you're working for? Come on out, and I'll tell you everything, Sean. William Conrad Philips was a penny-ante thief, a pickpocket who wanted to be famous. So, he shot Clyde Ritter. It's a good story. People understood it. It didn't make them feel unsafe. The research was spot-on. You think your story's gonna be better? The truth is only gonna... Scare people, Sean. And you know what they say. If it ain't broke... Give me five minutes. I wanted to thank you... As if that would even be enough. Not necessary. Just sorry you didn't get to make your speech. I've been thinking about it. How would I sum myself up in one word? "Sacrifice" comes to mind. Back when I was in the Secret Service, my word was "duty". Didn't matter who I was protecting, whether I liked them or not. Then I became a lawyer. "Law" became my word. I didn't always follow the law. I bent it. Still do. Somehow, I ended up a private investigator. And now my word... Is "truth". It's not always what people want to hear. And sometimes, it isn't what I want to hear. But that's my word now. So, why don't you tell me the truth, Brady? Who's really behind the murder of your father? I don't know what you're talking about. The gunman got into the ballroom wearing an e-pin. 17 were issued that day, three to members of your family, including you. The truth was staring at me all along, that photo of you and your father taken the day of the assassination. And you're not wearing your pin. You weren't a politician back then. You were a drunk... With a trust fund. And along came Bob Scott with a generous offer to buy your pin. Your own money. Not doled out by a disapproving father... And you took it. I swear I didn't know they were gonna kill him. What did you think was gonna happen? All of our biggest contributors were there, millions in jewelry. I thought it was gonna be a robbery. Who was behind it? I don't know. But I have spent the last eight years trying to make up for what I did. And whoever it was, they're not gonna stop me. I actually believe you, Brady. I wish it made a difference. Congressman. Let's take a walk. Crazy how that evidence box ended up on my doorstep. Who would have done that? No idea. I bet you lost a lot of sleep over the Clyde Ritter assassination. I did. Everybody deserves a good night's sleep. You call that a plan? Locking yourself in a tunnel with a guy holding a gun armed only with a light? No, plan "A" was a light and a gun. Hello. I'm calling with a message from the Director of the Secret Service. He wants you to know that he saw you on the news, and that's a very good excuse for canceling your reinstatement interview. Welcome back. Well... I'm gonna miss you. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. Don't tell me I'm not gonna miss you. Do we have to argue about that? You're not gonna miss me because I'm not taking the job. Michelle, that's the career you worked for. That's... Your straight line. It was. But then you said something to me that made me change my mind. What was that? You said I was the only person you could trust. And that means more to you than the Secret Service? That means more to me than anything. Of course, you didn't trust me enough to let me know you thought Joan Dillinger was in on it. You couldn't let that go, could you? - Stay off that arm. - Ow. Sean King. You should have been satisfied with being a footnote in history. Who is this? A friend with some good advice. Sometimes, politicians need to be brought to heel. If they don't listen to reason, there are consequences. Your partner knows that better than anyone. What does this have to do with Michelle? Hello? Hello? Sync & corrections by P2Pfiend.  Www.Addic7ed.Com.
