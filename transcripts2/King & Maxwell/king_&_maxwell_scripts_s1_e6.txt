 Sean and Michelle are hired by Congressman Brady Ritter, son the Vice Presidential candidate who was assassinated on Sean's watch. He's now running for Senate and wants to find the blogger who has been writing articles about him and his family. Sean is more than a bit uncomfortable working for Ritter but the Congressman assigns no blame for his father's death. It take them little time to find that the blogger known as the Madam Beltway is actually Angela Miller but they no sooner find that she is killed. Finding her source is the next step but Sean and Michelle have to move quickly if they're to find him before the assassin does.

 [ Announcer ]: Good morning Washington. Looks like it going to be a beautiful... [ Michelle ]: Is this guy ever going to come out? [ Sean ]: It's only been a few hours. WJQQ FM. ♪ Sister Christian, oh the time has come [ Chuckles ] Oh, man. Golden Earring really brings me back. "Sister Christian" is by Night Ranger, Sean. No, it's not. Trust me. [ Chuckles ] If you need it to be Golden Earring... No, I don't need it to be Golden Earring. It is Golden Earring.

 You know, I don't like to play this card, but... Here we go. No. A lot of people consider me a Rock-'N'-Roll aficionado. It's by Night Ranger. It's always a competition with you. [ Laughing ] I am not competitive. [ Scoffs ] - Oh, no? - Just accustomed to winning. Yeah, well, you're not winning this time, because I happen to know everything there is to know about that song. That song is forever ingrained in my memory. Let's... leave it at that. Oh, no, Sean. Don't tell me you became a man to "Sister Christian"?

 She was a very special girl. With very bad taste in music. She appreciated the hidden gems of Rock 'N' Roll. Of Night Ranger. [ Vehicle approaches ] [ Engine turns over ] There he is! [ Horn honks ] - This is your fault. - This is your fault. King & Maxwell 01x06 Stealing Secrets Origianl Air Date July 15, 2013 ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com There is nothing to put on the spike, Sean. Sean distracted us. It was low payout, anyway. The guy wrote bad checks. Oh, please. Help yourself. [ Sniffs ] Oh, I wouldn't shower yet. A member of congress will be here any minute, and walking out in a towel might not make the ideal first impression. Who are we dealing with? Congressman Brady Ritter. Called 17 minutes ago. As in Clyde Ritter's son? Were you just gonna gloss over that name? I thought we could make a go of it. You Haven't seen Brady Ritter since his father died on your watch. Out of the blue, he calls... I didn't say I was optimistic... [ Knock on door ] Congressman. It's been too long, Sean. And we've been through too much, so, please, don't call me congressman. This is my partner, Michelle Maxwell. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. Last time we spoke was at the funeral. I'm not here to talk about my father. How can we help you? Um... Do you read Madame Beltway? I try to stay away from the tabloid bloggers. She's a problem I need... handled. Silencing journalists isn't what we do. Look, I know I signed up for every punch that I take. But, um, for the last two weeks, Madame Beltway has been going after my wife, private matters from a previous marriage. And I fear that my daughter is next. She just left rehab. And, um... and we're a family again. But I'm about to run for senate. I don't know what happens to her recovery... if that story breaks. Well, I have to ask. Why come to me? I need a favor from someone they can't link to my staff. What exactly do you want us to do? Just find out Madame Beltway's identity, and then we can talk about ending the stories. Will you help my family? Michelle: What is the Ritter family hiding? Starting anonymous is easy. Staying anonymous is someone who doesn't want to be found. Well, we have to look somewhere no one else has. You're taking this case because you didn't protect Clyde Ritter. No, I'm taking this case to help Clyde's son. You didn't protect your friend Clyde. Now you want to help his son. That's exactly right. Clyde Ritter wasn't my friend. He was my protectee. We're trying to track this blogger. Now, the Internet has to live somewhere, right? Where, exactly? Farms. Server farms. Show me? [ Computer beeping ] [ Munching ] Washington server center. This would have clients' billing information, including - Madame Beltway's identity, right? - Yes. - Edgar, could you hack in to this site? - Yes. Fantastic. [ Slurps ] - Will you? - No. U.S. D.O.J. CCIP Section 3120. It's against the law, Sean. Well, then... I guess we'll just have to do this the old-fashioned way. Hi. We're here from A.J. Concept Solutions. You have a server down? This is the first I've heard. Then count yourself as lucky. I-I'm just gonna need to call my... This is an internal problem... malware. This could be a boot sector or root kit virus. We need to see your computer. Ah... We can keep you out of the report. Please tell me you didn't download these pictures in the last few weeks. [ Gasps ] Is that bad? T-they're just so darn cute. Like little people in tuxedos. Yeah. Your adorable penguin pictures may have crashed this entire facility. [ Voice breaking ] This virus is my fault? It could've been anyone. I don't want to say we're in full-tilt crisis mode, but we have got to stop the bleeding. Why don't you two go take a look at the server? I'll take a crack behind the wheel. Okay. [ Horns honking ] Well, well... Sean king? What brings you by? Meeting Brady. I'm surprised his Chief of Staff didn't know that. How are you, Peter? Feeling like I can breathe a little easier now that you're here. Peter, play nice. You remember my wife, Donna, don't you, Sean? Of course. She's helping out with the campaign. Peter. It's a shame you're not still running for congress. What happened in there, Walt? It'd just be nice to have someone in this seat who understands how the real world works. Timing just wasn't right with Ritter's Senate Race. Yeah, well, if you change your mind, make sure you give me a call. And who would want to go through that? As soon as this is over, I'm going straight back to my charity work. Sean. Come on in. Have a seat. Who was that? [ Chuckles ] Walt Harris. Wall Street Lobbyist. He's pushing a bill to expedite foreclosures, and I'm killing it in committee. Wall Street Lobby never did like your family. No. [ Chuckles ] What'd you get? Madame Beltway's identity. Angela Miller. We're working on tracking Angela down. Yeah, well, a blogger's nothing without her sources. You find Angela's anonymous source, we can end this. [ Thinking ] Our last picture together from the day of... [ Crowd cheering ] [ Screaming ] Sean? You okay, Sean? Oh, I'm... I'm fine. Madame Beltway. Angela Miller. Which would you prefer? Can I help you? Let's talk Congressman Ritter. Say whatever you want about him, his family is off limits. Last I looked, my first amendment rights Haven't changed. First amendment cuts both ways. Is that how this works? If the stories about Ritter don't stop, then I call my buddy at the Times and reveal your identity. It's time to step into the limelight. I'm outing myself when I reveal my source, but thanks for playing, though. Even if it means tearing apart an innocent family? You have a loose definition of the word innocent. - What you working on, Edgar? - Bad numbers. Sean wanted bad numbers for Brady Ritter's tax return. Filing false tax returns is a felony. Hey, Sean, did you hear that? Edgar doesn't want you to go to jail. Yeah? Well, he may change that tune quick. Not only did I use Angela's e-mail to set up our meeting at Lucy's, I figured out her password. - I turned around, and I hacked it. - You hacked it? Yeah. Looks like Edgar isn't the only computer genius around here. No, I'm pretty sure he is. Do you have those tax returns? I-if you file those, you could face five years in a Federal Prison. I'm just using these as bait. [ Camera shutter clicking ] Our blogger will want to verify these with the source. I'll be tracking her every step on this burner phone. You hacked that e-mail, didn't you? Hey, Sean. What was so urgent? [ Sighs ] What can I say, Benny? I missed you. No, you didn't. I wish you did. I need a favor from someone who looks... like a criminal. So you called me? Since you actually are a criminal. Was a criminal. [ Sighs heavily ] What are we doing? Selling a politician's tax returns... sort of. Need me to play along again? Like last time. We're running the Armenian Circus. What do you say? [ Sighs ] How the hell am I supposed to know what she looks like? Shes a blogger! 400 pounds and in Angry Bird PJ's sounds about right. Two coffees. You are not gonna believe what is on this Congressman Ritter's tax returns. Tell me, baby. There's offshore accounts, there's doctored deduction. I've seen proof of tax evasion. And the best thing is, I got it all... Right here on this phone. This could be a big sell... 5 grand, maybe 10? 10? Try 20! Jackpot! [ Gasps ] Oh, my God! Ohh! Damn it! I spilled it all over me. Oh, my God. What a mess. Let's go get you cleaned up. Yeah, let's do that. [ Groans ] Have you been working out? As a matter of fact, I have. Thanks for noticing. Sopping wet. Oh, you're a klutz. I'm a klutz?! You're the one who knocked it off. - Edgar? - H-h-hi, Sean. Where's she headed now? The burner phone GPS confirms Angela arrived at a Barney Circle Coffee at 1:13 P.M. Barney Circle Coffee. What is that? Uh, a theory. What if... Clyde Ritter wasn't killed by a lone gunman? What does it have to do with our anonymous source? Potentially everything. The day Clyde Ritter was assassinated, I was blinded by the sun. But I-it wasn't the sun, which means the gunman was working with someone. Even if that's true, what's the Brady Ritter tie-in? It's the pattern. See? It's hit pieces from anonymous sources. It's a media blitz. It's pushback from Wall Street. It's the same strategy used eight years ago. It's... it's... It's history repeating itself. Sounds like you're trying to force a connection. No, it sounds like the same people who assassinated Clyde Ritter are now character assassinating his son. I don't like this road, Sean. No, it's not a road. It's just... just a theory. And now Bob Scott from your Secret Service days is involved? If it wasn't a lone gunman, that might explain why Bob was looking away when Clyde was shot. Sean. You always say you've made peace with your past. I have. Is that what this... Wall of Crazy tells you? Ooh, oops! I-I did it again. Edgar? You got something? Angela's social media check-in indicates a location at the National Mall. It's inconsistent with the burner phone GPS location at 175 G Street. Michelle, Angela could be meeting her source. That's good work, Edgar. - Yeah. - That is good work. Okay. The GPS says Angela Miller is somewhere down here. Are you listening? I'm doing something very important. That tells me it's meaningless. I am looking up the greatest hits of Golden Earring. There's no better way to settle an argument than... are you kidding me? [ Gasps ] "Sister Christian" isn't on there?! Oh, come on. It's probably the wrong album. Or the wrong band. Don't count this as a victory. Oh, I already counted this as a victory. You don't think you're competitive? How about right now? [ Gunshots ] [ Camera shutter clicking ] I love seeing your name on my caller I.D. It's how I know I'm going to have a great day. [ Sighs ] The victim is Angela Miller, A.K.A. Madame Beltway. I think we're dealing with a pro here. One shot to the head, two to the chest. Sounds like a homicide for Metro. And while they may appreciate your exhaustive analysis, we do not. We're on the hunt for classified documents from a congressman. That makes this Federal. Oh, on the hunt. [ Sarcastically ] Tally ho. Hey, guys? You're gonna want to see this. Someone dropped an e-cigarette. If our hit man stood here with a smoke, he'd have eyes on the entrance and the exit. [ Cellphone rings ] Explain to me again what you two were doing here? [ Cellphone beeps ] Hello? There is one other reason I called. The victim had a phone that's part of our investigation. Let me guess. You want it? You know, Rigby, you get me. Hey. Hey. That was Edgar. He found out how Angela talked to her source... Her draft e-mail folder. They shared the same e-mail account and communicated through drafts. Untraceable. I like it. It's how they coordinated their document drops. The source just left a note and asked for a new drop location. Wait. So, does that mean the source didn't kill her? They think she's still alive. Well, if they're asking for a new drop, we ought to give them one. [ Bell jingles ] Hey, is that Jerry? - Jerry! - Jerry! [ Chuckles ] Well, looky here. Jerry Walkeiwicz, P.I. - How you doing? - Keeping above the fray, working with the movers and shakers. What about you, Michelle? You looking for a new partner? And I mean that in the broadest definition possible. You're a sexy man, Jerry. Not sure how I'd keep my hands off of you. You making a drop? How'd you know that? Jerry, I think we're on opposite ends of an explosive political conspiracy. Who are you working for? I was hired by an attorney who was hired by an attorney. But that's how I roll... clandestine. You hear about Angela Miller? [ Sighs ] - I knew it. - I knew it. - Guys, what happened to her? - She was killed. FBI thinks it's a cover-up that goes all the way to the White House. I don't know how to tell you this, Jerry, but they think you're her source. No, no, no. I'm, uh... I'm not her source. I-I-I... I can't believe shes dead. You're a person of interest because of all those draft e-mails. Wha... I... I don't even know who I'm working for. I'm... I'm just the middleman. People are gonna find that hard to believe. I mean, look at you. You scream "Mastermind." I know. I know. [ Breathing heavily ] Look, we need you to hand over the envelope. The FBI has this whole place bugged. [ Gulps ] I'm being framed. - You're being what? - Framed. He says it's a frame. He's being framed. Framed. Framed. Framed. Framed. I'm being framed. You guys have got to believe me, here. Okay. It's okay. Just hand over the envelope, we'll let you slip out the back. Holy... Move it! Get out of my way! Was that mean? He's gonna be telling this story for years. Ritter's gonna want to see this. If you know who compiled these, it could help us find Angela's source. This looks like our OPPO. Your what? Opposition research. We pay a guy named Teddy White to dig up dirt so we're prepared for any mudslinging by my opponents. Why not just go to Teddy when Angela's stories hit? We did, and he assured us our OPPO was safe, which was a goddamn lie. None of these pages were in the vulnerability study that Teddy gave us, though, so let's not jump to conclusions. I-I-I'm sorry. What are we doing here, Brady? I mean, your whole family's taking it on the chin in the press, your OPPO's in the wild, and you're wasting time with a P.I. who couldn't even do his first job. Donna: Peter, you have a call on line 3. It's urgent. [ Sighs ] Excuse me. Look, um... I never lived my life like I was running for congress, you know? A whole lot of bad decisions. If my OPPO is out there, we need to get it back. What if this is bigger than one blogger? What if it is a link to your father's enemies? Maybe the banking lobby. Come on. What, are the Illuminati behind it now? I never took you, of all people, as a conspiracy theorist. We have a problem! Just the one? Teddy White was just picked up by the FBI. His prints were on an e-cigarette found at Angela Miller's murder. Still so sure he isn't the source? Yes. Teddy's worked for me for years. He's no murderer, and he's not the source. Either way, he is in FBI custody, which means we can't talk to him. Well... not with that attitude. I came as soon as I heard. As soon as you heard what? About the baseless claims leveled against my client. Yes. I've been retained as Mr. White's counsel. Isn't that timely? I'm sorry... Who are you? I need a moment alone with Teddy. Obviously. He's gonna need a better lawyer than you to get out of this. Ritter sent me, Teddy. He told me you were innocent. But, listen, if I'm gonna help you, you need to tell me everything. - You understand? [ Sighs ] - Yeah. So, why were you at the garage? I tracked Angela there. I thought she'd meet up with Jose Alvarado. I don't know who that is. Enlighten me. Jose's the best OPPO researcher in D.C. He's a real street-level dude, gets dirt no one else can. I use him secretly. His work keeps my lights on. Why did you think he was gonna meet Angela? He has to be her source. I've had security breaches on four political clients, including Ritter and Peter Murray. For Peter's congressional run? Yeah. Common link? Jose. How did you know Angela Miller was Madame Beltway? We worked together. I signed an N.D.A. I swear I never gave her anything on Ritter. Okay. Okay. So, you follow Angela to the garage. You think she's gonna meet Jose. Instead, this G.I. Joe-looking guy comes out of nowhere, shoots Angela. I was terrified. How do I find Jose? You can't find Jose. He finds you. [ Computer beeping ] - Good morning. - Oh, good! You're here! We got a hit. Through Jose's tax ID number, we were able to track his earnings. Define "we." - Edgar. - Ah, not surprising. Everyone can't be a computer genius. Isn't that right, Edgar? [ Groans ] [ Sighs ] Go ahead. Tell him, Edgar. Tell me what? I hacked Madame Beltway's e-mail. You just found the username and the password in the browser, Sean. Well, that... That isn't hacking? You pressed "enter." What did you guys find? Jose's earnings track to a bar called Vetoes, wire transfers through a shell company. Any idea what Vetoes is known for? - Strippers? - No. - Hookers? - Getting colder. Well, now any answer's a letdown. Pizza. Backroom poker. A political haunt our N.S.A. buddy, Larry, played at. From the size of Jose's transfers, I'm guessing he had a gambling debt. That would explain why he sold his secrets. I bet these guys would know how to find Jose. These guys might also want to break Jose's legs. You know, a game like that is almost impossible to get into. Not if you have a plan. And I have a plan you're going to love. Whenever she says that, there is nothing about her plan I love. Nothing. Yep. Confirmed. I don't love anything about this. Relax. I'm not even gonna play. Name one time when you walked away from a challenge. Every time I watch you flirt. How is that a challenge? I resist teaching you how to do it. Name another time. Okay, you occupy the bouncer until I get in there. Giddyup, cowboy. Hey, Nick, my man! Hey, listen, I know that I owe a few dollars there and a few dollars here. But you got to let me in there! What do you say! You need to leave, sir. [ Laughs ] Come on, man! You raise your voice again, I'm gonna make you. [ Laughing ] Isn't that rich?! [ Groans ] Oh, Nick? Is that all you got? [ Groans ] Hey, I didn't mean... [ Groans ] Oh! Man: $500 to you. Man #2: Damn, I'm out. Man #3: I'll see you $500, raise $500. Man #4: Nope. I'm out. Man #5: I'll call. It's $1,000 to you. I'll call. Hey. Larry Needham sent me. [ Alarm beeping ] Gun, cellphone in the basket. [ Both grunting ] [ Cellphone chimes ] Well played. Straight wins. Deal you in? 2k buy in. Yeah, I think I remember how to play a little hold 'em. [ Grunting ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] Turn... king. $500. Call. Call. River... 9. All-in. All-in. [ Sighs ] There's a part of me that feels bad about this. You were chasing your straight, but you didn't hit it. Now you're trying to bet your way out of it. You had pocket queens, which was good, but now you're in too deep. Let's be real. I was in the Secret Service. I read faces for a living. This... Was not a fair fight. Full house, kings over 2s. Whoo! [ Inhales sharply ] Sorry, boys. Same time next week? Not a bad showing for a first timer. Cash you out? I'm looking for a little information. Think you can help me out? I can be a very good tipper. [ Chuckles ] Does the name Jose Alvarado mean anything to you? Yeah, it does. How bad is his gambling problem? [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] The only gambling problem Jose has is what to do with the money from his rake. He is the house. [ Gunshots ] We've got company! Sean, grab my gun! In the basket! Who's that guy? Card dealer who works for Jose. Correction... Card dealer who is Jose. [ Gunshots ] That hit man must be after him! Wait, you brought a hit man to my game? I didn't bring him! Jose, we can protect you. You better. Come with me. This way. [ Tires squeal ] Ow! Geez! When you said you were gonna protect me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind. Catch. Seriously? What, are you shaking me down, now? Hey, 10 grand of that is mine. Well, come on. This is overkill. Take this off, and we'll talk. No, you'll talk, and I'll decide if they come off. [ Sighs ] Are you Angela Miller's source? 'Cause I think you sold her your secrets and then had her killed - to protect your identity. - No. She was using my OPPO, but I'm not her source. [ Sighs ] Two weeks ago, my office was broken into. My raw documents, insurance policies, stolen. Insurance policies? I keep a few pieces of dirt on each client that they've never seen. My October surprise hits. That's what keeps me bulletproof. Please don't say the word "hit." Yeah, well, it didn't work so well here. Why not go to the police? If I can't keep secrets, my life is over. I tried to find out who robbed me, but before I could, the stories started hitting the front page. Look, whoever killed Angela is clearing the deck, and I'm the next card. Now, you gonna help me or not? [ Sighs ] [ Groans ] There's nothing about this I like. Well, now we're even. - How many aspirin is that? - Two. - I'm gonna need the bottle. - Will you focus? I'm trying to overcome internal bleeding. I don't trust this guy. He ruins lives for a living. He's also our only shot at finding the source, not to mention Angela Miller's killer. We get the hit man, we get the source. We do this, we'll need help. I'm gonna have to pat you down. No, you're not. I need to make sure you're not wearing a wire. No. Especially after what happened last time. Unh-unh. Okay, bye. Okay! You decide to get handsy, I will break your hand. Arms, please. Thank you. [ Patting ] Michelle Maxwell. Oh, feel that core. You doing ball work? - Danger. Curves ahead! All right. - You're done, Jerry. No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I gotta check the thigh. - No. That's where I always hide my wire. - I'm checking in the thigh. - I'm clean! Okay, bye. Okay! Thank you. Ah! Ah! Oh, please, no, stop! Mercy! I'm sorry! Please! I know you're just the middle man, but you need to let the source know that Jose Alvarado wants to meet at D.C. Central Station at 5:00 under the clock. [ Breathing heavily ] We're all set, Jose. You're coming with us. If we need a plan "B," we're using you as bait. Nothing about that sounds safe. That's why it's plan "B." Edgar, we're going to D.C. Central to flush out our hit man. 127 arrivals, 104 departures, the fourth-busiest train station in the United States. Yes, that's great. Listen. Any hit man worth their salt is gonna do pre-attack surveillance, so we need to get there early. An extra set of eyes could go a long way. I need your help, Edgar. There are good crowds at D.C. Central. - I-I don't like crowds, Sean. - Yes, I know. I know that, Edgar. Listen to me. This lapel pin... Is a camera. Now, if you can program its feed into my laptop, you and Jose can work from the car. And Michelle and I will be inside on earbuds. It'll be like... Like we're partners on a Secret Service Detail. - Like you and Bob Scott. - Yes. Bob Scott was with you on Clyde Ritter's detail. He let you down, Sean. And you won't, Edgar. I need a friend to watch my back. I am your friend, Sean. Bingo. [ Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. system ] Nice call with D.C. Central. I ran six ops here in the old days. Huh. I ran 10, but who's counting? Always you, it seems. You remember the golden rule of D.C. Central, or do you need to phone a friend? Terrible for snipers. Michelle: Giving no clear vantage point. Yeah, I know. I paid attention to briefings sometimes. He wouldn't use a gun. Even with a silencer, the impact shot would scatter the crowd. I'd want to use them to my advantage. You know what I'd use? - A shiv. - A knife. I said it first. You think our guy's here right now? Yeah, I think he's here. He's medium height, trim haircut, military build. [ Lock clicks ] - No way, Jose! No, no, no, no! - I'm not just gonna sit here. No! No way, Jose! Man: Hey, look out. Man #2: Excuse me. H-he's running. He's running. Jose's gone, Sean. What? Jose? Tick tock. Tick tock. Good catch. Sean, I have our hit man. Get Jose out of here. Jose: What? What are you doing? [ Crowd shouting ] Man: Hey, look out! Woman: He's got a knife! Are you okay?! [ Lock clicks ] [ Both grunting ] [ Gasps ] Man: Stay back! [ Breathing heavily ] Not another step. Let... her... go.  [ Breathing heavily ] Back off. Okay. Okay. Back off. All right. Easy. Easy. Why don't you just let the girl go? [ Groans ] - You all right? - Yeah. Well, that's what I call good training. [ Breathing heavily ] You grabbed a mop. And saved her life. With a mop. All I'm saying is this one goes in my victory column. Okay. You can have the win. [ Breathes deeply ] I got my win. Good job. All right. I came alone. You know the name Kurt Mathias? No. Kurt was the man cleaning up after the source. He killed Angela Miller. He tried to kill Jose. He even tried to kill us. Should I recognize him? He's an ex-con from Roanoke. You're the reason he's no longer in jail. You lobbied the governor to have him pardoned. You wrote three letters. Why? Um... Actually, Peter asked me to lobby for Kurt. Why would your Chief of Staff want Kurt pardoned? He was a family friend. Are you saying that Peter is the source? He was planning on running for your congressional seat. He even had OPPO prepared. I bet he was upset when that didn't come to pass. After you pulled the rug out from under him. You can stop right there. I told Peter I needed him on this campaign. He said he was relieved. [ Breathes deeply ] We'll see. People in this town... say a lot they don't mean, congressman. Hey, Sean? You asked me why I came to you. After my father died, um... I pulled my life together. I wanted to do something meaningful. I got a second chance. You deserve that same opportunity. Thank you, sir. Now, you listen to me. I have served the Ritter family for years! Kurt Mathias pulled the trigger, but you had him pardoned. I had nothing to do with that blogger's murder! We don't think you did, Peter. Donna: Excuse me. What is going on here? - Michelle: Your wife, on the other hand... - What? Was it tough playing second fiddle to the Ritters? Peter's congressional run was your prize for 20 years as the understudy. What are they talking about, Donna? Your wife always was involved with charities. She counseled troubled youth. Isn't that right, Donna? Kurt Mathias was one of those young men. And now it was his turn to give back. He stole Jose's secrets, and you gave them to Angela Miller. When she was ready to out you, Kurt tied up loose ends. Don't worry... the FBI has phone calls between Donna and Kurt to prove it all. I want a lawyer. Well, I'm a good one. But there might be a conflict of interest. Hey, Edgar? Hey. - What's this? - Voice message. "Hi, Sean. This is Bob Scott. I'm in D.C. I need to see you. Call me." When did he call? Edgar? Hey, is he all right? I'll talk to him. Hey. You don't owe Ritter anything. We solved his case. One case doesn't pay that debt. You and Bob Scott are headed down a rabbit hole that leads nowhere healthy. It leads to the truth. The truth can't bring back Clyde Ritter. The truth can't erase the past. What good is it? September 25th was a Sunday. You all right, Edgar? You want to talk about what happened at the train station? Sean ne... needed a friend to watch his back. You are Sean's friend. We wouldn't have solved this case without you. You did great. Bob Scott didn't watch Clyde Ritter's back. I didn't watch Jose's back. We let Sean down. I won't let Sean down again. The day of the Ritter assassination... a light from the back blinded me. [ Breathes deeply ] I read the Ritter commission's report. Yeah, the report said it was sunlight... coming through the blinds. It wasn't. I know that now. Then what was it? Some light source we missed during our sweep. That's my best guess. You think I had something to do with it? Shots were fired. You weren't looking at the stage or the gunman. Why is that, Bob? [ Sighs ] I heard a... voice in my earpiece. "Bogey at 7:00." When the shots were fired, I thought they were coming from there. All the details' chatter was in the commission's report. And this wasn't. I thought I imagined it. That's why I didn't say anything. I've been living with this for eight years. I was blinded. You were deliberately distracted. That's not the work of a lone gunman. That's a conspiracy. Who wanted Clyde Ritter dead? [ Sighs ] ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com
