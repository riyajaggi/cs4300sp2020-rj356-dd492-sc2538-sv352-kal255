 King & Maxwell (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 7 - Family Business - full transcript 
 Michelle is surprised by the sudden arrival of her brother JT who, it turns out, is now a private but needs help since he isn't licensed in D.C. He's working for Elroy Culpepper who has hired him him to check up on Tommy Smith, someone his daughter Claire met on the Internet. They trace him to a cheap motel and search his room where they find he has ID cards in several different names. One of the IDs is for St. Bartholomew's hospital in Baltimore, a lock-down facility for the criminally insane. They learn he tried to gain access a few days before but was unsuccessful. When Claire shows up they try to convince her that Tommy is a con man but she isn't buying it. Turns out she's right and her boyfriend has a good reason for having a false identity.

 There she is. Same time, different guy. Sean: Doesn't she get tired? Well, she is an athlete. Hey, didn't you read her file? Of course I read the file. I always read the file. Okay. What kind of an athlete is she? [ Camera shutter clicks ] I started to read the file, and then the camera broke. You were supposed to read the file. I was supposed to go out and get us new equipment,

 which I did. It's called division of labor. I still think you might have wanted to consult me. [ Camera shutter clicking ] Hey. In our line of work, we need high-end equipment that doesn't malfunction during the job. What's to consult about? I would have voted not buying a camera that cost more than my first car. Relax. I told you. - This camera will pay for itself. - How? Well, right now for example. [ Camera shutter clicking ] I can get within 10 feet of our philandering jockey, 'cause I look like a tourist checking my phone...

 Not someone who's been paid to take pictures of a... Very... very... Ooh, s-she's a gymnast, huh? No, Sean, she's not a gymnast. She's a... Oh, and they just closed the blinds. Show is over. But don't worry because I got the shots. Matter of fact, I got some amazing shots. I'm telling you, this camera... - Unbelievable. - Sean, I think you've been made. [ Chuckles ] - It's already paid for... - Hey. Give me that camera. Or what? Give me that camera right now, or I will break your arm. Sean, I fear for your life. [ Chuckles ] You're adorable. Go fetal! Guard the camera with your body! I got it! Camera's okay! Good to know! Say my name! I don't know your name. Oh! King & Maxwell 01x07 Family Buisness Original Air Date July 22, 2013 ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com I can barely move my hand. Probably should have read the file. If I could make a fist, I would punch you. Here's the invoice for the adulterous cage fighter. [ Slam ] [ Telephone ringing in distance ] [ Groans ] Is the phone ringing, or is that my head? No, I hear it, too. Where's my... What's... What's this... [ Ringing continues ] Why is my phone in the fridge? It kept asking me the same question. Press one for yes, press two for no. I pressed two. It's a recording... Asking if you know a J.T. Maxwell. I don't know a J.T. Maxwell. But you know he's one of my brothers, right? Then it should've asked if I knew of a J.T. Maxwell. What's going on? I'm trying to figure it out. I just can't get a live person. [ Gasps ] Huh? It's from D.C. Metro lockup. Man: Your brother, J.T. Maxwell... My brother's in jail. [ Slurring ] I-I didn't know it was one-way. Sean: [ Sighs ] Apparently, your brother was getting a ticket, and he tried to argue his case right then and there. [ Sighs ] Coaches, bosses, cops... Nobody tells J.T. what to do. Wasn't he a cop? Or was that just your other three brothers? All of us... kind of mandatory to wear blue at some point when your dad is chief of police. J.T. made a better cop than all of us combined, but he barely lasted a year. - What happened? - Same thing that always happens. He got bored. Hmm. He's great at everything he does except for following through. There he is. Man: That wouldn't be a problem. Thanks for the help in there, brother. - Appreciate it. - Get in here. All right. Ohh! There she is. Little sis. [ Grunts ] [ Laughs ] Ohh! [ Sighs ] Sean King... the man with the plan. J.T. Maxwell. Nice to meet you. Welcome to D.C. This is how I find out you're in town? Yeah, sorry about that, but, uh, you know how it is when you're working a case. What? A case? Last I heard, you were opening a-a swimming-pool bar in Key West. Yeah, I was, but that was before I decided to follow your lead. - Check it out. Sean: - Huh. You're a private investigator now? Yeah. What do you think? I think... My favorite part is the giant magnifying glass. I know. But look what it's magnifying. A dancer? No, Michelle, that's... that's a ninja. A ninja. Why would it be a dancer? That makes, like, zero sense. [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] Wu, this is Michelle's brother. Hi, uh... [ Conversing in Cantonese ] He speaks Cantonese? That's my brother. Lot of surprises. My client's Elroy Culpepper. Remember him? Wealthiest man in Nashville. Yep. Got a daughter named Claire. Calls her Daddy's Little Flower. [ Chuckles ] Anyway, she fell in love with some guy on the Internet, and Elroy's worried that he's out to steal her trust fund, so he hired me to check up on him. And what'd you find? Name's Tommy Smith. Claims to be a D.C.- based businessman, but I can't find a paper trail. No work or credit history? Nada... actually, there's a P.O. Box in Dupont Circle. That's what I was doing... I was down there staking it out to see if he showed up when those two bicycle cops came and got their panties in a bunch, 'cause "technically" I'm not licensed to operate as a private investigator in D.C. Really sticklers, those guys. Yeah, but turns out this is a great opportunity for you guys. - Great. - Terrific. But you are technically licensed in Nashville, right? Passed the exam and everything? W-well, there's... whether or not I took a test or even knew that there was a test, that's not the point. What the point is, is that Metro's on my case now. Let me guess. This is where the opportunity for us comes in. Exactly. My retainer's 10 grand, half of which is yours. All you got to do is cover me while I look into this guy. Metro would be less likely to hassle him if he's working with two licensed P.I.s. I don't know, J.T. We don't usually take on private family matters. What are you talking about? Half the cases we take on are private fam... [ Thud ] Ow. Why are you kicking me? [ Thud ] H-hey! You just did it again. You guys want to... Do a little private pow-wow thing, go ahead. I'm gonna go update Culpepper. Look... I adore my brother, but if I keep cleaning up his messes, he'll never grow up. He just started his own business. What is more grown-up than that? He thinks airbrushing a picture of Sherlock Holmes on the side of a van is all it takes to be a private investigator. Well, that is a big part of it, certainly. Look, it'll be harder for him to get arrested when he's under our noses. But not impossible. Trust me. The guy at the mailbox place said Tommy Smith has his bill delivered to this address. So much for his "successful businessman" story. Hey, I bet that's the manager sitting in that lawn chair right there. Okay. So, how do you want to play this? Sit tight. I got this one. What is he doing? He's talking to the landlady. Now... He's motioning for her to follow him. You realize I can see everything you're seeing, right? Give me those. I can read lips. He's thanking her. "Time is Lovely... Time is Money." No, I'm sorry. That's wrong. He's saying lime with an "L." "Lime is running out." You have no idea how to read lips, do you? No. But in my defense, it seemed like something I would be good at. He... he's going. [ Knock on door ] Come in. Come in. All right, if we all take a room, we can do a full search in less than five minutes. Now, when I was on vice, 9 times out of 10, they would hide the drugs in the sofa cushion. I don't have my bowie knife. I left it in the car. No! We're not gonna add search and seizure to illegal breaking and entering. The manager let me in. All right? According to the law, we're still on the up-and-up right now. Sean, tell her. W-well, technically, your brother's right. Ooh-hoo! J.T., one... Little Mick [Pops lips] zero. Little Mick? Don't start. And don't get me all riled up by taking his side. Hey, I'm only on the side of the law, Little Mick. Aha. I knew it. False alarm. It's just sugar. You do know real P.I.s don't say, "aha." Let's go, Sean, before he accuses Tommy Smith of God knows what. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hang on. I found the gold mine. Please don't take apart the furniture. Aha! Tommy's got I.D.s from all over... Same face, different name. What do you think? Fine. Aha. [ Keyboard clicking ] It's burglary. It's not burglary. We didn't take anything. Took pictures. We took pictures of pictures. It's a gray area. So, you're a P.I. Now. I am. It's just like being a cop, without all the hassle. Yeah... you mean laws. Now I get why you left the secret service... All the paperwork. I didn't mind it. You miss that life? Never. No. No, no, no. Nope. I can tell by the five nos... believe you. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Just like you like it. Thank you. Nice sandwich. Hey, Benny. This is my brother, J.T. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Sean said you needed a forgery consult? How you doing? Good. Really good. Um, so, I'm just gonna be in there. He worked for you... beginning of last year? Woman: No, September. Right. I'm sorry. September. And he worked there until... Until August. Right. August. Remember when our band totally dominated at Senior Prom? You mean the greatest pyrotechnic display of all time? [ Chuckles ] Yeah, looking back, using real fire on stage probably wasn't the best judgment. Yeah, you were lucky you didn't burn the school down. I was talking to dad. He said I was lucky that you thought to bring a fire extinguisher... Three of them. [ Sighs ] When were you talking to dad about high school? I was talking to him last week... On his birthday. Mick, you said you were gonna call him. I was going to. And then I didn't. [ Sighs ] Hey, guys. Did you find anything? Yeah, we paired Tommy's I.D.s and nametags with his driver's license, and I've been calling some of his old bosses. I think we're getting pretty close to forming a timeline. Edgar: His longest job was nine months... A gas station in Louisville. His shortest was six weeks in Omaha. Anything that says what he's actually doing in D.C.? Well, I got an employee I.D. here from a hospital in Baltimore. Looks like your guy tried to make it himself by laminating over a visitor's pass. Quite clever, actually. What do you mean, "tried"? Well, it's a dud. The print from the visitor's pass shows through. You could solve it easily with a slip of plastic or a piece of wax paper. Maybe he did that next. So that could be a first draft? Probably was. He was close. Can you tell how recently he made this? The date on the visitor's pass is from a few days ago. So Claire's boyfriend spends six years bouncing around the South and the midwest and then suddenly sets his sights on a hospital in Baltimore. Be nice to know why. Seems like we should check out St. Bartholomew's first. [ Indistinct conversations ] Good afternoon. C.C. Baxter, Medical Worker's Union, Local 647. I need to talk to one of your orderlies... Uh, Jason Franks. I'll page him. Uh, ma'am... He's been the victim of bullying, some intimidation. Why don't I just go find him? Patient areas in this hospital are restricted to cleared personnel only. No exceptions. Just wait here, sir. Jason Franks, please report to first-floor reception. Jason Franks, please report to first-floor reception. What was that? The tough guy stare-down? He just doesn't like being stared at by some random guy in a mental hospital. I'm Jason. You're looking for me? Yes. We just have a few questions. You guys cops? Yes. We used to be. It's not important. We're private investigators looking for a con man who calls himself Tommy Smith. No. This guy? Yeah, this guy was here a few days ago... Impersonating me, trying to get into the South ward. But luckily, you need more than a hospital I.D. You got to pass through a thumbprint scanner. You got a lot of security around here. What's in the South ward? High-risk patients. High-risk of what? Escape. It's a maximum-security lockdown for the criminally insane. Hmm. I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong? Don't like being touched. How come? I don't remember. You know everything in the world, but you can't remember why you don't like to be touched? No. Not everything in the world. Numbers, data, dates... Spoken data, printed data... Patterns, sounds, smells. When my mind gets like that, I close my eyes and take a deep breath. Why? Try it. Chin up. Close your eyes. [ Breathing deeply ] See? Benny said most of the time these I.D.s were so well made she couldn't tell them from the real thing. He's trying to get into a place most people want to get out of. Why? Well, that ward would be pretty well-stocked with powerful sedatives, horse tranquilizers. For criminally insane horses? How badass would that be? [ Laughs ] [ Knock on door ] Can I help you? I'm sorry to disturb you all. My name is Claire Culpepper. I'm looking for a Mr. J.T. Maxwell. How can I help you? My father hired you to scare off my boyfriend, Tommy Smith. I'm here because I need you to do the opposite. Please find him and bring him back to me. I've been leaving messages for Tommy since yesterday, calling and texting him nonstop. We've never gone this long without talking. Whatever you did, I want you to undo it. Well, I didn't do... Look, your daddy hired me to check up on your boyfriend, all right? - That's all I did. - Then where is he? Sean: I have some bad news for you. Tommy's a con artist. He's probably moved on to a new identity and a new victim by now. You should be relieved to be done with that boy. No. You're wrong. You don't know him. I don't think he wants anyone to know him. There's an explanation for this. I know it. Mr. Maxwell, whatever my father is paying you and your team, I'll double it. We can't take her money. J.T. already works for Claire's father. Well, wait. It's not a... It's not a conflict of interest if I work for both of them, is it? - What?! - No. Sean, if you had to ballpark a percentage. It is 100% a conflict of interest, J.T. Really? Like the time you were 100% sure Devin Woods wasn't cheating on you? - Low blow. - Yeah. Guys, guys, guys. Culpepper hired J.T., not us. We can take Claire's case. [ Sighs ] But should we? She's just delaying her heartbreak. She needs us, Michelle. [ Sighs ] Claire: I didn't expect to fall in love with a guy on the Internet. Is that why you kept your relationship a secret? Were you embarrassed? I wanted to tell my family as soon as it got serious. Tommy said no. Why? He said we would as soon as he was ready. Ready as in engaged? That's what I thought, so I didn't push it. But now... I don't know. I have to ask you this question. Did he ever ask you for money? No. Never. He didn't even talk about material things. Tommy helped me realize that I wanted something different than what my dad wants for me. It's not easy to forge your own path. I'm 26 years old, and I've never traveled or lived on my own. I went to law school for him. I thought it would make a difference. A difference how? Oh, don't get me wrong. I know he loves me, but... I'm sick of being a disappointment just because I grew up. Hey, so what's the story behind Little Mick? [ Chuckles ] Well, after four boys, our parents were convinced they were gonna have another one, so they wanted to name him Mick after our grandfather. Michelle was the closest variation? No, my dad didn't care if she was a girl. He wrote "Mick" right there on the birth certificate... My mom that changed the "K" to an "H," but it stuck. [ Chuckles ] She said growing up was like a fight to survive. For me! I fought with my old man every day. I figured if he wasn't gonna be impressed with what I was doing, I'm gonna do what I want. Not Mick. She went the other way. Trophies and awards, and her and my old man were like this. And it worked... for a while. What happened? She turned 16, 17, started dating. He put an end to it. He said she couldn't go on dates? Oh, he didn't have to. He'd just have the guy tailed by an unmarked car. [ Chuckles ] Yeah, well, that'd do it. Huh. Well, they're okay now, though, right? Michelle hasn't talked to our father in... Two years. Hey. Hey. I think that's our guy. [ Tires screech ] Sean: - Who the hell are these guys? - Whoa, whoa. Hold on. Man: Come here! Aah! Really? [ Grunting ] Put your hands up. Stop. Put your hands up. Yeah, put them up like that. Okay. [ Groans ] See? It didn't even hurt. [ Straining ] Why are you helping him? It's got to be fair. You're not putting your hands up. Aah! [ Tires squealing ] Put some ice on it. [ Siren wailing in distance ] Where's Tommy? He's... he was right here. We save him, and he bails on us? You're welcome! You're sure it was the same guy you saw at St. Bartholomew's? He looked right at me, and he was closer this time. He wouldn't keep his hands up. We need to go back to the hospital. Why? You all right? You don't look bad. No, to see Jason Franks. Oh, he could help us find the guy that tried to kidnap the guy that tried to impersonate him. It's cleaner if we don't put it like that. He'd have access to the visitors' logs. We know the exact day and time he was there. Exactly. Edgar, I got a name for you to run. Yeah. Joey Montoya. And try Joseph, too. Wow... that's a lot of Montoyas. Uh, I'll get back to you. Hey, guys. We got to narrow it down some. All right, um... Birthmarks, tattoos? I don't think so. How about jewelry? Class ring, maybe? Cufflinks. Yeah, real douchey ones. Well, that's a place to start. What do you they look like? [ Sighs ] Blue... Gold-ish. I don't know. You know as well as I do there's nothing more unreliable than an eyewitness. In the secret service, we got credible details from witnesses all the time. There's a trick to it. Just relax, close your eyes. All right. Picture him. Now... see the cufflinks in your peripheral vision. Mostly blue or mostly gold? Blue. Okay, now the gold parts... Do you see angles, or do you see curves? Angles. A zigzag over a triangle. Okay, how many humps on the zigzag? Two. Like a-an "M." It's not an "M." It's an "M" on top of a triangle. Can't believe I just remembered that. I didn't even laugh when you said humps. That was awesome. [ Laughs ] Way to go, Mick! I did half the work, but I-I get it. You... you guys are bonding. Uh, an "M" on a triangle is a Mayan symbol for worshiping fertility. A sigma on a triangle represents a traditional homo-erotic male bonding ritual. It's Greek letters. You found all this because Montoya's college fraternity gave out gold cufflinks. Apparently, that was his high point. He spent the rest of his 20s in prison. Think they'd teach you how to keep your hands up in there. That picture of him on a courthouse step... that's recent. Does it say what the case was? [ Keyboard clacking ] Rico... eight men tried together on racketeering, huh. All acquitted. That guy behind Joey Montoya on the stairs, he was at the hospital, too. Edgar: George Palmer, Esquire. Jason Franks showed us the hospital login sheets. They claimed to be visiting Ethel Donovich, who, turns out, is in a permanent vegetative state. We need to figure out who else was in the South ward they might have gone to see. Hey, Benny says she's got something on the I.D.s. I should check this out. So, I know this S.S. guy from back in the day. Edgar gave me the digits Tommy was using, so I ran them by this guy. And he says they're the real article. But how can the social security numbers be real if the identities are fake? That's the other thing. Most of those are real, too. Joey Montoya was a bookie and a leg-breaker. Maybe Tommy Smith owes him money. Sure. Tommy's in hiding. That's why he's got all the fake I.D.s. Well, being on the run makes sense. But Claire is positive he's not a criminal. Mick, come on. Huh? She's sweet, but how could she really know? I've never seen someone so sure of the guy she loves. So I did some digging on the numbers to check the date of issue. You know you've got the rusty rake when a guy born in the 1970s has a social security number issued in 2005. Follow me? All except the rusty rake. It means fake. Haven't you ever been to London? Think Claire's right about Tommy? Or you just want her father to be wrong? Hey, he's still my client. Hello. Did you find anything, Edgar? The lawyer in the picture also represented Bernard Cohen, A.K.A. The big C, A.K.A. Street Boss. Indicted six years ago, trial still pending. Currently resides at... St. Bartholomew's hospital. I remember that. Mob boss in Baltimore wore a pink bathrobe and a shower cap to all the pretrial hearings. That explains everything. Great job, Edgar. Yeah. I know. So, Tommy's numbers match, all issued 1979, the year he was born. Tommy's driver's licenses aren't forgeries, Sean. They're genuine government issue. Huh. That's what I thought, too. Holy shazam. Always figured the government had a cache of persons who only exist on paper. Well, what do you mean? Names with socials, history of addresses, and such, so if anyone went looking, nothing would seem out of place. You think Tommy's a spy? CIA? No, he doesn't seem like a government agent. Who else could get primo cards straight from the source? Tommy Smith made a hospital I.D. to see a mob boss. Why? I think I may know why. - Hello. - Sean? I have a theory. [ Both ]:Tommy Smith is in the Witness Protection program! Why do you keep doing that? I don't want you in my office. I don't want you in the building. J.T., it was a pleasure to meet you. You're welcome anytime. You two, please, leave me alone. Wow. Rigby doesn't like you. Did you actually think he was going to confirm that Tommy Smith is in WITSEC? Not really, but he didn't have to be so hurtful. Well, WITSEC list is the most private thing in the world. Only the Marshals Service has it, so... Who are you calling? [ Ringing ] Marshals Service. [ Chuckles ] [ Southern accent ] Hello, this is Deputy Gerard calling from the Palmetto Grove Sheriff's Department. Listen, we picked up a Tommy Smith for speeding here. He asked us to call you. He says he has a code word. Probably just a nut case, am I right? Man: Can I speak with your sheriff? Oh, you want to speak to the sheriff? Well, he's right here. Just a minute. [ Southern accent ] This is Sheriff Glanville. How can I help you? I need to speak with Tommy Smith. Put Tommy Smith on the phone? Yes. Yes, sir. We'll call you straight back. Uh-huh. [ Beep ] Nice dad impression. [ Normal voice ] Yeah, well, I do do a good sheriff. Yeah, real good. Well, sounds like we were right. Tommy Smith is in WITSEC. Not anymore. This guy I was talking to on the phone, he was in a panic to find him. Edgar said the key witness against Bernie Cohen was his former accountant, right? Now, the name's been sealed. This could be Tommy. Well, that would explain why Montoya tried to kidnap him. If Bernie's in psychiatric lockdown, then who's running the show? Maybe he is. Maybe he's just pretending to be crazy. Think about it. Why would somebody deemed mentally incompetent be meeting with his attorney on the regular? Bernie meets with George Palmer. George Palmer makes the moves on the outside. Guys, guys. We can solve all of Tommy boy's problems, okay, and also clean up a lot of Baltimore's trash if we go mano a mano with this Palmer. We're trying to find Tommy Smith. Now you want to start a war with the mob? Why do you... do you see what she does? No matter what you want to do, she puts a bad label on it. I have noticed that, but I do think finding Tommy Smith is the way to go. The one thing we know for sure... if Tommy's the accountant, his life is in danger. They're probably gonna have the whole damn Marshals Service looking for him right now. Well, we've got something they don't. Mm-hmm. [ Sighs ] I thought I knew him. We still don't have all the answers, Claire. But we know Tommy's in danger. What do you want me to do? Call him. But he's been ducking all my calls. Leave him a message. Tell him you're in D.C. with people he can trust. Tell him you want to meet him at the fountain at Montrose Park at 5:00. You think he'll listen? Well, that depends. I mean, he told you he loved you, didn't he? We know he's a liar, but did he lie about that? [ Door opens ] J.T., what was that all about? I don't think this scheme of yours is gonna work. Oh, so it's a scheme? Who's putting a bad label on things now? I'm serious, Mick. Claire's father's been calling me nonstop. What do I tell him? That you're following every lead and you'll call him when you know something. That's what P.I.s do. Can't you stick with the plan just once? [ Door closes ] [ Beep ] Woman: Law offices. George Palmer, please. Hey, you want Tommy Smith, he's gonna be at the fountain in Montrose Park at 5:00. [ Beep ] If he doesn't show, I-I don't know what I'll do. I can't live without him. That's not true. I have given up everyone else in my life for Tommy. Not yourself. That's all you really need. Tommy. Claire. Hi, Tommy. Hi. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to fix it first. Is that why you went to see Bernie Cohen in the hospital? To try and fix it? They found out about Claire. I would've done anything to keep her safe. I left WITSEC. I was even gonna recant my testimony. It wouldn't have mattered. The mob doesn't give pardons. I thought I could offer you the kind of life you deserve... but I can't even tell you my real name. I don't care what your name is. I know who you are. [ Footsteps approaching ] Oh. Get behind me. Hey, guys. Stop and drop your weapons... Now! Michelle: I'll get at least one of you. Probably two, guaranteed. [ Grunting ] [ Choking ] Put your hands up. Put your hands up here. Listen to me. Don't ever point a gun at my sister. [ Panting ] What's up? I thought you weren't gonna make it. [ Scoffs ] We almost didn't. Rigby was pretty pissed to get a voicemail saying you guys were doing a mob takedown. Hey, I said, "Be there or be square." What more does he want? Thanks for going with my idea. Uh, I think you mean my idea. No, mine was the one where we found Tommy and got Palmer without starting a war with the mob. That was my plan. Well, I don't like plans. I like to improvise. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I'm a ninja. A ninja. Watch out for the giant magnifying glass. My brother thinks being a P.I. means you don't have to do paperwork. How did J.T. get out of this, anyway? If you find the answer to that, I'll give you $1 million. Thanks. Uh, Michelle? Mr. King? We just came to say goodbye. Goodbye? Where you two going? [ Chuckling ] Actually, we have no idea. We hope it's somewhere warm. [ Laughs ] I don't understand. We're entering witness protection together. I can't believe it, but... Claire is willing to go with me. What about your dad? I told him that I'm happy. Thank you both for having faith in us. You're welcome. Okay, the Marshals are ready to take you two to wherever it is you're going. We're ready. Well, good luck, wherever you end up. Oh, be sure to thank J.T. for us. He's the best. Will do. George Palmer's barely been in custody a few hours. Singing? Like one of the three tenors... Serving up details about the syndicate he ran for the Baltimore street boss. Soon as Palmer became a coconspirator, he gave up all attorney-client privilege. Bernie's crazy act fell apart at the seams. He'll be in jail before the end of the week. [ Sighs ] You're welcome, Rigby. You did good. All of you. All of us? [ Elevator dings ] Yeah... you, J.T., Michelle. These are incomplete. You should think about changing the name of your firm to Maxwell, Maxwell, & King. Don't even think about it, Little Mick. Relax, Baby Spinz. - Where'd you hear that? - Your yearbook. Hey, by the way, you look good in a mullet. Business up front, party in the back. Hey, Sean, I didn't know you were captain of your break-dancing squad. [ Sighs ] That must've been a different Sean King. I don't think so. [ Sighs ] [ Clears throat ] And it's "spin." The "Z" is silent. Hey. Hey. So, Tommy and Claire are going into the Witness Protection program together. They told me to tell you thank you. Good for them. I'm lousy at goodbyes anyway. - I know. - Yeah. You want some pie? No, thanks. I'm good. Yeah, well, I don't blame you. It's not very good. You know where they're gonna have great pie? Where? J.T.'s Swim-up Bar and Café in Chile. [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] You found an investor in Chile? Yes, I did. Well, technically, it's not an investor as much as it is an adventure-tour place that offered me a job, but you know how much I've always wanted to kayak the Rio del Carmen. - No, I didn't know that. - Yeah. Are you mad... 'cause I didn't follow through? No, I'm bummed that you're leaving. This was fun. Yes, it was. I'm glad that I came out here to D.C. to see how well you're doing. We didn't really get to talk about home, but we'll do it next time. What's happening at home? A little bit of a health scare with dad. Just... Is he okay? He's okay. He sent you to make peace with me, didn't he? [ Sighs ] He's even more stubborn than you. But if he did... would you call him? I'll try... to try. Fair enough. [ Chuckles ] Hey, I know I haven't said it lately... But I'm proud of you, big bro. Always have been, always will be. What? What? Are you... what? What'd you say? [ Southern accent ] Can you say that in my good ear, there? [ Clears throat ] What did you say? [ Southern accent ] I said... Say it again. Say it again. Give me some of that pie. - Mm-hmm-hmm. - Here. [ Normal voice ] Bad, isn't it? [ Normal voice ] The worst. - Well, it's mine. - Mnh-mnh. - So slide it back on... - Mine now. - No, don't do the... - Mnh-mnh. Don't do the giraffe thing. - Reach for it. - I hate when you do that. - Reach for it. - Can I get some pie, please? ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com
