 King & Maxwell (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 3 - Wild Card - full transcript 
 King and Maxwell offer their services to FBI Special Agent Darius Carter after they learn he's been suspended for striking a police officer during a routine traffic stop. Carter says he showed the cops his badge and but they were completely uninterested. They told him to get out of the car and one thing led to another. Maxwell quickly finds evidence that Carter was set up and that the cops were likely paid to do it. King concludes that it has to be related to one of the cases he was working on. When one of Carter's informants is killed, it leads to a drug cartel and a U.S. Congressman.

 Stealing credit card numbers was a bad idea Hank. Jumping bail was worse. Where'd you go? I was on the phone. While we're chasing a skip? Come on. Look at this guy. He couldn't run down an escalator. Uh, Hank? Was I talking to you? Oh ho ho, yeah! Really, Hank? That's your thing? Getting stepped on?

 Look, I'm getting away. No, you're not, Hank. Oh, come on. Show the guy a little compassion. Don't. How often do you think Hank here gets stepped on by a woman as good-looking as you? Once... Amsterdam. Come on. He's going to jail for six months. You're not gonna step on him? Give him a little nudge. Come on. Take off that boot. Let's see those little piggies. Come on. Gross!

 King & Maxwell 01x03 Wild Card Original Air Date June 24, 2013 ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com I mean, I consider myself a pretty sexually adventurous person, but feet? Ugh! Yeah. What do you mean "adventurous"? Nothing weird. Outdoors. In national landmarks and monuments. You know... normal stuff. You've had sex in national landmarks and monuments? Here in D.C.? - How many? - Six. Oh! Rigby's here. Six? Look at us, meeting over a body that's still breathing. That's not something you see every day. His name's Hank Barnes. Wanted for wire fraud. Skimmed credit cards while he was working at a shoe store. Want me to call it in? I'll take it. Excuse me. I don't think we've met. Steve Gibson. Michelle Maxwell. You worked with the Secret Service, right? - Yes, I did. - Right. We both did. Sean King. Hey. He's been out a long time. Nixon... not a fan. Nixon? Yeah, I used to work up on the hill. Do you want to grab a coffee sometime? Sure. Let me just, uh, cut Barnes loose, and you can cuff him. Hm. I see you got a new partner. What happened to Special Agent Carter? Promoted? Suspended. What? Why? Last night, he got pulled over for a busted taillight. He took a swing at one of the officers. It's too bad. He had a bright future ahead of him. Thank you for the collar. So, not the Lincoln Memorial. So, the... the Washington Monument. Do I look like a walking cliché? Come on. You said six, right? Six? Remind me never to share anything with you. Hey, Edgar, here's our invoice. We get 10% of the bond on Hank Barnes. Ka-ching. Why don't people pay you? What are you talking about? Of course people pay us. These people don't. Why don't people pay you? Betty Camden never paid us? We found her twin sister! We're private investigators, Edgar. That means people hire us to find the truth. Unfortunately, the truth isn't always what people want to hear. So... sometimes they blame us. It's part of the job. See, to me, Edgar, that's just a bunch of words. Sean's a lawyer... A man of words. I, on the other hand, am a woman of action. Take action, Edgar. Make these deadbeats pay. Just like you did at the I.R.S. What do you suppose happened with Special Agent Carter? No idea. You know, if he got popped last night, he's probably getting released in a couple of hours. No. No, no, no, no. You just heard Edgar. We need paying clients. Michelle, no one deserves to lose their career over one mistake. - We did. - Yes, we did. It's taken me eight years to make my peace with that. You've only been out for 18 months. All I'm saying is, we talk to Carter. That's all. Uh-huh. And then you're gonna do what you always do when I don't want to take the case. Which is what? Put me on the spot. Hey, man of words, right? Woman of action. I will do all the talking. What are you two doing here? Michelle? We came to see you. We want to help. Thanks, but I'm not looking for a P.I. Agent Carter... You know FBI internal investigations can drag on for months. You need to get your story out right now. You want to know my story? Here it is. Two white D.C. cops pulled me over for a busted taillight. I badged them. They didn't care. Told me to step out of the car. Then one of them put his hands on me, and I just snapped. Bottom line... I should've known better. Hey, you want to know what it's like to be put on administrative leave? Ask me. Or, better yet, ask her. It sounds like a paid vacation. It's not. It's hell. You may not need a P.I., but you sure as hell need a lawyer. To say what? That I was provoked? You think that matters? I won't know until you retain me. But I know I can help. All right. You want to be my lawyer, go ahead. It's not gonna make a damn bit of difference. Is it just me, or is he hiding something? Talk to me. I'm at the site of Carter's traffic stop. No witnesses. Where are you? I'll give you a hint. It smells like Brylcreem. Tell Agent Steve I owe him a call. Bye. Make it fast, King. I'm tracking an oxycontin ring, and I'm on a roll. I want you to help Carter get his job back. What's it to you? I'm his lawyer. Well, that makes this easy. Go talk to legal. I thought you two got along. We did. Of all my partners, Carter lasted the longest... Nine months. We had a cake. The guy's on the bricks. His case is being handled by some desk jockey who couldn't hack it as a field agent. You know what that means. Carter punched out a cop. He's lucky he's not breathing through a tube. And you're his partner. You're supposed to have his back. Partners get assigned. Carter wasn't my choice... not with his history. What history? You have anything else, take it up with legal. We're done. Betty Camden? Yes? I work for King and Maxwell. You owe them $1,786.55. Could you wait one moment, please? All right! Hey. Sub in for me. I don't know. Administrative leave's not bad so far. Tell me about your brother. What does my brother have to do with my case? I think you know the answer to that. I told you I don't make excuses. Neither do I. I'm a lawyer. I make arguments. The FBI made theirs. Let me make yours. It was his first car... A 12-year-old candy-apple-red Camaro. Now, I told him what was gonna happen. I warned him. "You see the cop lights, you pull over. "Both hands on the steering wheel. "Look straight ahead. "'Yes, sir. No, sir.' Don't give them anything." But the first time it happens, he looks in his mirror and sees they have their weapons out. And he panicked. He reached for his wallet in the front seat, and one of the cops yelled "gun!" What else do you want to know? Now let me ask you about yourself... Honest assessment. Do you have a temper? Me? I was picked for hostage negotiator school at Quantico. So, what happened last night? Getting pulled over, pushed around by a pair of cops... That made you think about your brother, and you just snapped. Now, that's not an excuse. That's a legal argument. How's your brother doing these days? Why don't you ask him? Officer Van Ness, can I talk to you for a second? Are you a Fed? No, I'm a P.I. Trying to get Special Agent Carter his job back. Everything I have to say is in my report. Fine. Then I'll just get your dashboard cam, and we'll see what a jury thinks about it. Well, good luck with that. We had a glitch last night while we were out. My partner is a lawyer. And when he gets you on the witness stand, you're gonna find out what it's really like to want to take a swing at someone. What you got? A solid legal argument to get Carter his job back. Better than "He was set up by two dirty cops"? Why is everything a competition with you? What's your proof? One of the cops smashed his taillight. I saw orange plastic shards he tracked into his squad car. You saw them? You can tell the difference between those and... say, cheetos? Hey, I got a picture. I do think of these... Oh, Edgar. Edgar, where are you going? Edgar. Talk to me. I'm talking to you. No... Tell me what happened. She asked me to get the clients who owed you money to pay. Sorry. I meant send them a bill. "Get those deadbeats to pay, just like you did at the I.R.S." That's what you said. That's what I did. Hey, Edgar, I'm sure you're hungry. Go get yourself a hot dog. We'll catch up with you. Just one? Here. Go to town. No... No, I... uh, bu... Get two hot dogs. Why are you so sure these cops targeted Carter? I'm an ex-cop. I come from a family of cops. Trust me... These two are on the take. They tailed Carter to a quiet street and disabled their dashcam. The question is why. Well, when Carter was arrested, he was automatically suspended from the FBI, right? Maybe it had to do with one of his cases. Which is why we need Rigby on our side. Okay, you do that. I'll find out who paid off these cops. How? Divide and conquer. In every partnership, there's an Alpha dog and a Beta dog. .Just like us. The Capitol steps? Just tell me... Did... did any of the six places have a-a gift shop? Bye. Agent Rigby. If this is about Carter, I've told you everything I have to say. What if I told you he was set up by a pair of dirty cops? I'd say that's an interesting theory that you should share with the bureau's lawyers. You always let your partner do your talking for you, Officer Palermo? Got nothing to say to you. Oh, my God. You don't know, do you? What are you talking about? You think that plumbing van parked across the street from your apartment is there to fix a leak, don't you? You framed an FBI agent. Do you have any idea how many branches of federal law enforcement have eyes on you? You're crazy. You know, I'm sick of your attitude. What do you want from me, King? All I want is a name. Who paid you to set up Carter? You think you're such a tough guy, going through partners. I know all about you, Rigby. It's all right there. Ah, yes. The Secret Service and their ability to read people. Go ahead. Take your best shot. You speak very deliberately. That tells me you overcame a stutter when you were a kid. That must have been fun in the schoolyard. You scratch your ring finger all the time. That tells me not long ago, you had a wedding band there. You spent 20 years as a special agent. That's a long time to go without getting promoted. That tells me you have something in your file that's holding you back. So, that's bullied as a kid, divorced, career tapped out. You stop me when I get something wrong. I think someone set up Carter because of one of your cases. And I need you to help me figure out which one. That's it. Joe, I told you I didn't want any part of this. She's a stupid P.I. Relax. Why? Because you say so? What if somebody from the cartel talks? Look, how could they possibly trace it back to us? I got a phone call and an envelope full of cash... period. So, what was it? What was what? The thing in your file that killed your career. Was it as bad as letting a presidential candidate you were protecting get assassinated? It was a kidnapping in West Virginia. The victim was the daughter of a local mill owner. She was only 17. I took responsibility. I expect my partners to do the same. Carter is taking responsibility. He was also set up. Now, who do you think would want him out of the way? Well, let's see... We have terrorists, bank robbers, Ponzi schemers. Take your pick. Look, I'm not trying to stonewall you. It's just not enough to go on. Thanks for the coffee. The two cops who pulled over Carter are on the payroll of a D.C. drug cartel. And your proof is...? I can't tell you. You work narcotics cases. Rigby. Rigby, his career is on the line here. A guy got busted in a drug sting last week. He said he had evidence against K-17, a Mexican cartel operating in D.C. He wanted to make a deal. Carter was developing him as a confidential informant. He was working this one solo. I don't know anything about K-17. How do they feel about snitches? Got some more intel on our C.I., Doyle Ross. 32 years old, lists his occupation as "professional poker player." If you get mixed up with K-17, you must like risk. Apparently, he's not a typical cartel guy. More of a bookish type. Hey. Hey. Sorry. Old habits. Mr. Ross, FBI. Open the door. I think we found Doyle Ross. He liked risk, all right. What could you possibly have been thinking not having gloves at a crime scene? Thanks for calling. You deserve to be here. Doyle Ross was my C.I. That should be me getting my ass chewed out by Rigby. What did Ross tell you? I only met him once... in jail, right after he got popped. He bragged about his knowledge of the K-17 cartel and said he had a "get out of jail free" card. Any priors? None. Bank records showed he received 2 grand a month from a shell company for the last seven years. That sounds like a cartel front. If I'd gotten more out of him, I could've kept him safe. Informants never give up everything right away. They always hold something back. And Ross was a poker player. There's no way he was going all-in until he had his best hand. I better go. Carter. We're gonna get you your badge back. Let me ask you something now... You know, an honest self-assessment. Why do you care so much? Where were we? Seriously, you should try it. What, sharks? I don't think so. Steve does triathlons. He must have a lot of stamina. Do you want to know what our dead guy was up to, or do you just want to stare at Gibson? I'm not staring at him. I'm staring at her. You saw that look, right? That's not morbid curiosity. No, that's "I'm passing a crime scene, and my photos are on the fridge." Please... I don't know anything. Please! It's okay. It's okay. We're not cops. We're private investigators. That means we're not gonna arrest you. But you could be in trouble, and I think we can help. I'm Michelle. This is Sean. I'm Patty... Patty Russo. Doyle's my boyfriend. I-I saw the coroner. He's dead, isn't he? Doyle and I met in an abandoned warehouse. I was soloing, and we went for the same shotgun. I-it was online... in "Flesh Eaters 2." I hope that's not a dating site. It might as well be. When you're the last two survivors of a Zombie Apocalypse, you really get to know someone. Did you know he dealt cocaine? We're not the police, Patty. He wasn't like a drug dealer at all. He was this total geek who had his friends over to play board games every Wednesday night. But then... He followed some of his D & D buddies into poker. And he started to make the real money. What do you know about his drug contacts? He has this friend... Gustavo. Works at Charlie Forte's Steak House. Doyle would pick up coke from him at the docks. Did he ever take you with him? What are you doing? I'm making piles... Papers, food wrappers, and actual food. Did... Did you shuck corn in here? I burn 3,000 calories a day. Deal with it. Incoming. Hey, didn't Patty say Gustavo rode a bike? Yep. And I just texted her a photo. Whoever that is, he's definitely taking delivery. So, National Aquarium. Okay, I'll give you all six national landmarks and monuments where I've had sex, but I'm gonna give them to you one at a time and without any warning, so you better pay attention to everything I say from now on. Yep. Patty says that's Gustavo. It looks like he's leaving. We got to stall him. My backup's in the glove box. I don't need a gun. Looking for this. You're going to stop them with my electric bill? And my one semester of maritime law. Hey! Hey! Wait up, guy! Ho-ho-hold on! Who's in charge here? Who are you? Terry Malloy... Warehouse Supervisor. Can I see your paperwork, please? Something wrong? Tell you in a minute. Who's the designated receiver of goods? This is basic stuff... Article 7, subsection 202 of the Uniform Commercial Code. We never had a problem with this before. Oh, sure. That's 'cause you were working with Fred Dobbs. I don't know who that is. Well, of course you don't. Why would you? He sat in that office over there watching the Nats games on a tiny TV until they canned his ass. All right. These are my boxes, and I'm gonna leave with them. Not until you produce the proper paperwork. Put the gun down now! So, how'd you do in maritime law? B. Maybe B-Minus. Who are you? You want to field that one? We're private investigators. We're here because of your friend Doyle Ross. He's dead. I can see you're worried. That's good. That tells me you didn't kill him. Now, why don't you have your guys put down their guns, and I'll tell you everything we know. The problem is, how do I know you didn't kill him? FBI! Freeze! Put down your weapons! Now! Put that gun down! Let me see those hands. Slow. Steady. Traffic was a bitch. I'm gonna need to see what's in those boxes. You got a warrant? We could go that route, or I could get probable cause. Probable cause! Come on, girl. She's a dog. Come on, girl. What do you see? What is that? What do you got? Open it. Grass-fed beef... from Argentina. For my restaurant. Well, go ahead... Search the truck. You know how this works. Sometimes the product isn't on the truck. When it is, call 911. Let's go. That was your only shot with Rigby. He's never gonna listen now. Maybe. Maybe not. Talk to me about Ross' "Get Out of Jail Free" card. What did you think he meant by that? He mentioned it the night he was arrested, right before he got his phone call, so I assumed he was talking about some high-priced lawyer. But...? I don't think he called a lawyer. What makes you say that? A PD got him released on bail. Who do you think he did call from jail? No idea. There's no way to connect a call from a jail pay phone to Ross. No. But if they were that important to Ross, chances are he called them again after he was released. Damn. If I still had my badge, I could pull his cell records. If only there was some other way to get them. Hm. Edgar, I need you to trace a call from a cell number about two weeks ago. Can you do that, please? Edgar? Hey. I know starting a new job is hard. A year and a half ago, I was with the Secret Service. My job was pretty straightforward. I protected people. I was good at it, and it made me happy. Now my job is different. It's a lot more complicated... And I'm not always sure I'm good at it. But change is good. Why is change good? You know, Edgar, I'm not really sure how to answer that. The truth is... "Change is good" is something my dad used to always say to me to get me to do stuff I didn't really want to do. You miss your old job at the I.R.S., don't you? I knew what to do there. What was that? People hide things. I find them. You mean money? I'd find money. You know what? Forget tracing that call. I've got something else for you to do... Like you used to do at the I.R.S. Doyle Ross received payments for seven years from a shell company. If you can find out who owns that company, we might be able to help Carter get his job back. Can you do that? Hot damn. Hi. I need to check my phone bill. My name is Doyle Ross. It's Sean. Sometimes, to get to the truth, a private investigator has to lie. Just a little. Yes, well, I would go online, Evelyn. The only problem is, I'm blind. And I don't have a screen reader. Well, here's the situation. Somebody stole my phone, and they're running up my bill. Yes, a braille phone. Why, yes, I agree with you, Evelyn. There is wickedness in this world. Is there any way you could help me? Well, God bless you, Evelyn. And may He keep you in the palm of his hand. Immediately after his release from jail, Ross made five calls in a row to... This man. United States Representative Oliver Dawson? Completely undistinguished legislative career, with one exception. I remember. Seven years ago, he was questioned... but not charged... In the murder of Eliza Perkins, an intern in his office. Very good. Found strangled in a D.C. park. The ligature marks on her neck matched her badge lanyard, which was never found. So, why would Ross call him? Dawson had a rep as a gambler. Ross could've been his coke dealer. That makes sense. After he's popped, he calls the most powerful guy on his client list. Have to go to the hill to find out. Yeah, I know. We'll be talking about that in committee. Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to take that up with appropriations. Yeah. Okay. All right. Bye. Congressman Dawson. I'm sorry. Do you have a minute? Well, for you, my dear, I have two. Michelle Maxwell. I'm a private investigator looking into the death of Doyle Ross. Doyle Ross? Uh, never heard of him. Was he one of my constituents? No. But he called your office five times last week. Do you have any idea why? Hundreds of people call my office every week, Mr...? King. Sean King. Ross made those calls right after he was arrested in a drug bust, sir. He seemed pretty desperate to reach you. A criminal calls my office... not me my office... where at least 20 people work every day. That's what's considered dirt now? This has been going on for seven years... The questions, the accusations. Well, thanks to you two, it's now reached a new level of absurdity. Excuse me. Let's go. That was kind of weird. Yeah! "This has been going on for seven years." I didn't bring up Eliza Perkins' murder. Did you? "Seven years." Seven years. What if the seven years of payments to Doyle Ross didn't come from the cartel? What if they came from Congressman Dawson? I got to call Edgar. Wait. Why would he pay money every month to Ross? Because Ross had a "Get Out of Jail Free" card. And I think I know what it is. Edgar. Sean. I got something for you. See? Alpha dog. Hank would've paid good money for that. How do you keep getting in here? It's Special Agent Kelso's birthday. We brought cake. Out. We were right about one thing. Someone paid off the cops to peel Carter away from his confidential informant. Only, it wasn't the K-17 cartel. It was Congressman Oliver Dawson. I see. And I suppose I just have to trust you on that, right? Wrong. Take a look under your cake. What's this? Proof that Doyle Ross was on congressman Dawson's payroll. Seven years of regular payments flowing through three different shell companies. The source... Dawson's re-election fund. Mm. Where'd you get this? I mean the file, not the cake. Actually, it was our genius bookkeeper, Edgar. Remember him? Turns out, he's one hell of a forensic accountant. You still haven't told me what the payments were for. Ahh. The answer to that question is inside Doyle Ross' house. I don't want to step on anyone's toes. King, would you please show me why you dragged us down here? Poker made Ross money. Dealing coke made him feel cool. But in his heart, Doyle Ross... was a geek. He still hosted game nights here every Wednesday. And here... His "Get Out of Jail Free" card. Eliza Perkins... Was strangled with this lanyard. I bet you'll find two sets of DNA on there, hers and her murderer's... Congressman Oliver Dawson. All right. I'll take it down to the lab right away. No, you won't. - Carter, lower your weapon! - I called Carter. I realized only someone with access to Carter's personnel file would know exactly how to set him up. That meant someone in the FBI had to be in on it. Gibson here was bragging all about his connections up on the Hill. Well, turns out, that included a stint as chief of staff to one Congressman Oliver Dawson. Where his job was to keep Doyle Ross quiet... First with payoffs and then with a bullet. Isn't that right? Come on, Agent Rigby. This is crazy. Really? Last time you were here, you were chewed out for not wearing these. Well, he did that on purpose. You see, Agent Gibson here, he wanted to make sure he got his prints all over the crime scene just in case you found evidence that Murderer Gibson left behind when he killed Doyle Ross. Aah! All right. Let's go. Vacation's over. I'll see you next week. What'd you do to him? I've never seen him so happy. He's mellowing. Well, thanks for getting me my badge back. Hope it helped. Dawson was questioned but cleared of Perkins' murder seven years ago. But the FBI found physical evidence linking him to the crime, prompting today's shocking arrest. This is Lisa for Channel 8 News. Doyle wouldn't have anything to do with a murder. I agree. But one way or another, he got his hands on the murder weapon, and he found a way to monetize it. Via blackmail. Doyle wasn't greedy. He was happy to collect a couple grand a month for his silence. Until he got arrested. Yeah, but then the blackmail wasn't about money anymore. He wanted the congressman to get his drug charges dropped. And, unfortunately, Congressman Dawson doesn't have that kind of juice. So... he had your boyfriend killed. Thank you... for all your help. And the pie. Bye. All right, I'm out of here. What? It's early. And we have an 8:00 A.M. with an insurance company. Their checks don't bounce. I need you sharp. The Smithsonian. That one's a freebie. The next five, you'll have to pay attention. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's you, Sean. Yeah. That's me. The night Presidential Candidate Clyde Ritter was assassinated. The man I was supposed to protect. Why did you let him die? In tort law... which I got an "A" in, by the way... To figure out who's at fault... You work backwards. The explosion was caused by the fire that was caused by the man that tossed... A cigarette. The roots of tragedy lie... in the smallest acts. Clyde Ritter died because of a pair of sunglasses. My sunglasses. I didn't realize I had lost them... until... Thank you very much. I was onstage with Ritter. You wear your sunglasses inside? You have to be ready... For the flashbulbs and the news lights and... What happened next. Someone opened up the blinds. Sunlight hit me in the eye. It was literally the blink of an eye. I spotted the gunman... killed him. It was too late. Ritter was dead before he hit the floor. It's your fault he's dead because you lost your sunglasses? That's right. You said to find out who's at fault, work backwards. Blame the sun, Sean. I wish I could, Edgar. That was good work today. Go home. Get some sleep. Hot damn. ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com I hope you're getting everything you need from this, Jason. I am, thanks. It's so great of you guys, letting me ride around like this. It's... it's really gonna help add realism to our scripts. Can't write what you know if you don't know what you write. Ah, wise words, detective Mike. Ah, lieutenant... Lieutenant Mike. So, Andrews... Uh, call me Jason. So, uh, Andrews, this TV show that you and lieutenant Mike write for... I'm not the writer. I'm the technical advisor. Right... uh, lieutenant Mike is just making sure that we follow rules and regulations and we use police jargon and... Okay, so what's this show about? Uh, it's called "badge of justice." And it's about a small team of detectives fighting crime and corruption inside the L.A.P.D. What corruption? Oh, you know, the usual... Beating up suspects, planting evidence. Taking bribes, racial profiling.
