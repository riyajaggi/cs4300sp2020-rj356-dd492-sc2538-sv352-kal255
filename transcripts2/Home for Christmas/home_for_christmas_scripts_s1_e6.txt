 Hi, Morten mouse. How's life? A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Everything good in the hood? DECEMBER 24TH I'll be home in about half an hour. And all the gifts are wrapped, so they're ready for you to swing by. Yeah, I guess, call me when you're outside, and I'll run them down to the car. Sound good? Cool. And, hey, love you, or whatever. OK. Later.

 See you. Hey, you. You're hard to get a hold of. - Jørgunn said I might find you here. - Congrats. Yeah. You won't answer your phone. - That's right. - Tonight's Christmas Eve dinner... See you there? Except I'm working, so... Well, Mom's saving you a space, hoping you'll at least try to... Hang on. How can you carry on about dinner like I didn't see you? Johanne, I am... - I'm really sorry... - Sorry? For what?

 For what you saw the other night. I... I'm actually embarrassed we're related, because you acted like a filthy... like a pig. Mom works so hard and sacrifices for her family. - Maybe I can explain. - No, it all seems pretty self-explanatory. Like, plain and simple, it was a shitty thing to do. I never expected that from you. ♪ But I can see a fire in the sky ♪ ♪ In this holy night Promise me a tomorrow ♪ Jørgunn! - Jørgunn! - Sorry, sorry! Hey, what happened? I don't know. I was just in the bathroom for two seconds and then... And then the candlestick and all the gifts started going up in flames. I'll fix it. I promise, I'll fix it. - Don't worry about it. It's OK. - No, none of this is OK. This is a total nightmare. What kind of idiot does this? I'm awful. Hey, no way is this your fault. I've got karma from hell, I'm discovering. These things happen, OK? They only happen because I'm the worst. Typical Jørgunn! Who incinerates someone's gifts because they wanted to pimp out a stupid candlestick? - Like, really? - Probably a lot of people. After all, candles are one of the top ten causes of house fires, so you know. - Yeah, that's what you said. - Yeah. I did. - But, hey... - Yeah? There were two gifts I did save. They're on your bed, so you just need to, you know, rewrap them and stuff. OK. See, it's not so bad... That's two, of, like, a million gifts, Johanne. It's fine. No worries. First, go and clean yourself off. And then we'll sit down and figure out the rest of the gifts together. Go on. I'll buy new presents for your whole family. Hi, Morten mouse! So, there's sort of been a, kind of, change of plans... Can you wait for us downstairs in the car? And we'll be down in a sec. Thanks. Bye, then. How have you been, pudge? I totally lost it on Dad. What for? I saw him out... OK? Yeah? And he was in broad daylight... or night, making out with some woman. Oh, you saw that? Huh? Well, Mom's in on it. It's some kind of weird deal they have. What? Oh... it's, like, a deal they've got going on. - An agreement. - Deal? And the definition of "deal" is, like, a "'Dad can run around on her' deal"? No, it's not like that. Mom already knows about it. In fact, Mom kind of has her own thing going on. - Wait, Mom's a cheater, too? - That's not a nice thing to call her. So, who's Mom having an affair with, then? - Reinertsen? - No way. It's not Reinertsen. So who? That Crawford guy from Texas? Ew! Jesus, no! It's that guy... That guy Arild. Arild? - Town Hall Arild? - Yeah. She's out of his league. Wait, why did you know this before I did? Because Mom actually feels safe sharing things with me. OK, but how... How long are they keeping up this whole charade? I think they're deciding before New Year's. Before New Year's... Man! Hmm. So, like, do I get Mom this now? Merry Christmas to you and Sir Arild, the boring! Why don't you just buy her a murder novel? You know she loves murder stuff. Did she tell you that I ran into them at the naked spa? Ew! You're the youngest! She's supposed to shelter you. She didn't tell me why you were at the naked spa. Do you have a punch card for the naked spa? Fuck off! You know what? Why don't you go and buy me more lame scratch cards for everyone? And I'll find Mom something appropriately murdery. Mm-hmm. - Great minds think alike. - Hmm? - Hey! - Hi. I'm getting a copy for my mom. Oh, wait. I was going to get one as a gift for my mom, too. - Copycat! - Copycat? - You're clearly copying me. - No! I remember she used to read it to me when I was little. - And at Christmas, she'd always read... - The Fir Tree? Yeah! The one where the Moomins are so terrified of the holidays. Yep. They probably realized Christmas is expensive! How's your dad? He's... I don't really know, honestly, so... - Hi there. - Hi. Oh, this is Morten mouse. Yeah. Hi. I'm Stein. Very cool. - My little brother. - OK... Stein and I know each other from spinning... skiing, Christmas parties... The usual. Yep. - I should be heading back. - Yeah. It was nice seeing you again, Stein. Merry Christmas. You, too. - Later, man. - Later. - Merry Christmas. - You, too. Say hi to Tor for me, OK? Yeah, that... I'll do that. - Well, Stein sure was very nice. - Yeah. Is that...? Whoa. Are you alright? I suck. I suck and I'm completely in over my head. It turns out I couldn't actually afford the gifts I promised, so I just panicked and bought the wackiest stuff instead! Stop laughing! It's not cute. Wait until your family sees this shit! And I'm wearing two hats for some dumb reason! Alright... This is so typical me. I'm a fucking failure! - Hey, relax. - I can't do anything right. - Not ever! - OK, look, calm down. You think I care about the gifts? You are the best person on the face of this planet. Sorry, but it's true. - Do you really mean that? - I really do. You're my best friend. - I'm your best friend? - Mm-hmm. OK. Now, come on. Let's go feed the reindeer a bunch of donuts or something. - Yeah. - Actually, I'm allergic to reindeer. Because of course you are! Where are you celebrating tonight, Jørgunn? I was thinking I'd just stay home. Or, actually, maybe I should air the place out a bit first. Probably. An angel? For me? Getting any visitors tonight? Oh, you mean from my dead friends or all my dead family members? Sorry. Don't be. When you're as old as dirt, and you don't have any children or a dumb husband, everyone else has croaked, or is about to. What are you thinking about? I was just wondering if you ever, maybe, have regrets... Deciding to not... To not pop a few out? Yeah. Oh, I'll tell you what, kid, my whole life has been so full of people and experiences. And family or not, I have never felt lonely. There's a difference between being lonely and alone. Let me tell you, one of the best things in the world is letting loose a sneeze without covering your mouth. Sebastian? Merry Christmas. - Johanne. - Yeah? - How many Christmases have you worked? - All of them. Is that right? - And you're working a double-shift today? - Mm-hmm. Yeah... Then I think you should... go celebrate with your family. You've paid your dues. But who will be covering my...? I'll be taking over for you tonight. You? Mm-hmm. - Thank you so much... - No... It's fine. My pleasure. I'm just happy not to spend the evening with my mother-in-law, so you're doing me a favor as well. Why don't you finish up your rounds and then... go home after? OK, thanks. Yes! Hey, this is Jørgunn. Leave a message for me after the... beep! Hey, call me back as soon as you can. I've got the evening off and need a dress! Do you have a minute? - Yeah. - I wanted to tell you something. OK. First, congrats on the time off. About time. I worked the last three years. Wow! Yeah. Yeah... Basically... I can't seem to speak whenever you're near me. - OK. Is it something I've done? - No. No, no, no. I like you. No. I'm... I'm in love with you. I figured I should probably say that. I've liked you forever and think about you... a lot. So... Well, that's out. God... Anyway, I was trying to say, but not very well, would you maybe... What are you...? Duh! You're the coolest person I know. And you're really, really pretty, or, of course, you're so much more than that. Obviously, I... Sorry. I'm sorry. I've got to... real quick. Hi, Jørgunn. It will be two seconds. Could you do me a massive favor? I need you to grab a dress and bring it to the hospital as soon as you can. Thanks. The dark blue one in the back of the closet. You rock! I need to hang up. OK, thanks. Yeah... So, where were we? You're so talented. You see people. The patients. So, I was hoping you might, maybe, see me? Heart attack, room 128! Sebastian. - Let me stay. - No! Go home now. I'll keep you updated. - OK. - I got it! You're good... Are you OK? - No. - No? Sebastian had a heart attack. No! I know you bonded with him. Yes. I made him a blanket for Christmas. Oh, really? That's sweet! But it seems a bit useless now. You know, the love... you give out... will always be coming back to you. - You know that? - Yes, I know! - Did you get that from Love Actually? - Yes, of course. - Oh, God! - Yes. You're doing a good job. - Thank you. - Laughter heals. - Yeah. - Yes. It does. Urgent delivery! - Thank you! Oh, my God. - You got it, girl. Hey, meet our clown. Hello. My name is Raul. - Jørgunn. - Jørgunn? - Yes. - What a beautiful name! Thank you! - Jørgunn? - Yes, it's... Jørgunn. Jør... - Jørgunn. - Jørgunn. - And yours is Raul? - I'm going to get dressed. - Raul. - OK... - Raul... - Raul... - Jør... - ...gunn. - ...gunn. - Yes! - I like your nose. - Oh, me too! Thank you. A beautiful flower for a beautiful lady. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hi. I'm glad you came, Johanne. Morten talked to me about... well, you and Mom. I was trying to tell you. I know. I'm sorry. How long have you and Mom... We haven't been good for quite a while now. One day, we eventually made the decision to... try some new, I guess, you'd call them "techniques," to see if there's still some life left in this marriage. We tried a lot of things... along the vein of that... naked spa... to spice things up, or try to. I'm sorry for what I said. I didn't mean it. I went over the line. - It just took me by surprise. - It's not your fault. I never meant for you and Morten to have to get involved in our... - Is this our last Christmas as a family? - I don't know. I... I hope it's not. Me, too. What happened to your crazy Christmas lights? Well, your mom... She doesn't want me to light them... because it will take out the neighborhood. I guess it's good that I brought your present, then. Wait, what does that mean? What are you up to? Holy cow! That's not a Powerman 64, is it? It is. - Can I? - Yeah, knock yourself out. Beautiful. Oh, oh... Merry Christmas to me! Isn't that great? Take this. Here... Let there be light! Wow! - That is a kickass reindeer! - Huh? - Kickass reindeer! - Eat it, Crawford! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. The food is ready, so let's all sit down. Of course, Mom made way too much food again. It's more than we could possibly eat. There will be more for my guest, then. Huh? Are you serious? He's really coming? I guess you'll have to wait and see. Come on, boys. Sit down. After you. Where are you sitting, hon? Don't eat that. That's icky. Johanne. He's coming, right? Ready? Alright, then. Merry Christmas... to all of you. Cheers! - Merry Christmas. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Well, please sit down. I must say, Johanne, we've been looking forward to this. And we're all so excited. Is he coming soon? Well, I'm expecting someone... pretty soon, I think. It's someone who... means a lot to me. Someone who has really opened my eyes, or, opened me up to find me. That is fantastic! Wow, those are some lofty words. - Right, Morten? - Nice words, absolutely. Sounds like you must really care for him. He's lucky. Good for you. Wait! Wow, Mom. - It's happening! - Calm down, alright? I need you to sit down, OK? Sit. I'll get it. Everyone, please give a warm welcome to a special person who... really changed my life. So, be on your best behavior. Please. Mm-hmm. - Hi! - Hi. Thanks for coming. I'd like you to meet someone. Oh... This is Raul. - Hi. - Hi! Hi! Raul has the gift of making our patients and us laugh. I guess he's the true healer of the hospital, you could say, like Jesus... Well, if Jesus were a clown. Yeah, laughter is the best medicine. He's the best. I've actually grown quite fond of this guy. - How fantastic! - Really wonderful. - Welcome, dear! - Thank you. Oh. And there's somebody who I hope you're already familiar with. - Oh... - Hi, Jørgunn! - Hi! - Also, Jørgunn is Raul's girlfriend. They literally just got together. Like, 104 minutes ago. Well, soon, 105, technically. Yep. I think so. Cool. As I'm sure you're aware, Jørgunn is my best friend. And sometimes, after a few years, you forget to appreciate the people you see the most. You take them for granted. You stop noticing how much light they bring into your life. Jørgunn is a person like that. She's... - She's a burning sun. - That explains the apartment fire. And last but not least, ladies and gentlemen, we have one more guest. Oh! Mrs. Nergaard. Mrs. Nergaard is one of my patients. But more importantly, she's a dear friend who has taught me so much about relationships, life, and all sorts of things I never really... thought about before. Why the long faces? Is this a funeral? I get that I'm old, but don't mourn me just yet. I'm not as dead as I look. No? Tough crowd! - Merry Christmas, Johanne's family. - You, too. We're being so rude. Merry Christmas! - Please, have a seat. - I've already got one! Oh, right. Sorry! Sorry about that. Forgive me. It looks like we've got to find some more plates. - I don't mean to be a bother. - Move over. Hi. Maybe some over there. Thanks. Yeah. - Careful. - Oh, and there. That's great. - Have a seat next to me. - Hey, you. This is nice. You look lovely. So, what's going on? I couldn't imagine better people to bring for Christmas Eve. You're blowing smoke up our butts, dear. Don't make us out to be a big deal. We're just three Christmas strays. It's OK. I'll open it. What's up? Trym found out about the whole Thomas thing. - Today? - Yeah. - On Christmas Eve? - Yeah. How did he find out? I told him. You told him? Surprise! We've got another little addition. - Someone you know already. - Yeah. You should probably... - Hey. - You just sit here next to me. - Thank you so much. - Of course. Thanks. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. Trym kicked me out. He kicked me out tonight because I'm... well, I'm a fuckup, so... We all make mistakes, dear. You're certainly not the only one here who has messed up your life. Is she, Tor? - The meal is getting cold. - Oh, is it? I don't know... Maybe more like hot and cold. Should we be expecting anyone else, dear? - I think we're good now. - I'm being serious, though. No, I swear, no one else is coming. OK. Great. Well, then, I want to say welcome. Help yourselves and Merry Christmas! - Alright! - Yeah... OK... You should have a sip. OK, I would like to treat you to a song we used to sing for Christmas back home. Is that alright? Yeah. Let's hear it. ♪ What... ♪ ♪ If the jelly king Found himself a soul? ♪ Soul! ♪ I'd go up to him And pinch his jelly rolls ♪ Roll! ♪ He'd overflow with laughter And then very soon thereafter ♪ ♪ Giggly jelly king Would fall into a bowl ♪ Bowl! ♪ If the jelly bowl Then fell into a boot ♪ ♪ And poor jelly king landed on his ear ♪ Ear! ♪ We'd be stumbling all over And get eaten up by Rover ♪ ♪ In his name We'll all have a jelly beer ♪ Toast! Cheers! Yeah... I want to say something. First off, I should say how darn skeptical I was, being invited to spend Christmas Eve... with random people. But Johanne, who is by far, the best person I've ever met, managed to talk me into it. As thanks, I'd like to share my family's Christmas tradition... The Little Match Girl by Hans Christian Andersen. I imagine you've heard of it. Oh, yes! I've always loved that story. Isn't it sort of sad? Well, let's see. "It was so incredibly cold. Snow falling... And it was almost pitch black outside. It was evening. This evening was the last of the whole year: for it was New Year's Eve. In the cold and in the gloom, a poor little girl was walking through the streets, with nothing covering her head or her frozen feet. Yes, of course, of course, when the little girl had left her home, she had slippers on to keep her warm, but..." ♪...holy night ♪ ♪ Shepherds quake ♪ ♪ At the sight ♪ ♪ Glories stream ♪ ♪ From heaven afar ♪ ♪ Heavenly hosts ♪ ♪ Sing, "Alleluia!" ♪ Momma. It was delicious. What in the world? What is it? I'm not sure. Ah! Ah... That's nice. ♪ Silent night... ♪ ♪ Holy night! ♪ ♪ Silent... ♪ ♪...love's pure light ♪ ♪ Radiant beams ♪ ♪ From Thy holy face ♪ Who is now? No idea. - You said no one else was coming tonight. - There isn't. Are we just going to sit here and listen to the door ringing all evening? Aren't you curious? I guess so. Yeah... Hi.
