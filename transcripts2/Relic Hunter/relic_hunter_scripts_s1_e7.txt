 Professor Fox. [EXHALES] I need to see you. I need to see you, now! Do I dismiss ballet class, or do you? [EXHALES] [DOOR SLAMMING] Who'd you think you are and what gives you the right to barge in-- This gives me the right. Derek Lloyd, USGI, Government Intelligence, Section 9. What's this about? Is this what I think it is? Half of it. Paracelsus scrolls. That's right. And you are going to help me find the other scroll before anybody else does. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [PROJECTOR CLICKING] Arthur Stanton, businessman, industrialist tycoon. One of those entrepreneurs that always teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. During the war, he built tanks. Problem is, he didn't care who he sold them to. Allies, fascists, gouged them both. When the war was over, the US indicted him as a profiteer. Where do the scrolls come in? He needed money. He also had a passion for gold. Ah, the promise of alchemy. Transmutation. Turning base metals into gold. He was last seen in Austria where he and the Paracelsus scrolls disappeared about the same time. I can't believe he found the Paracelsus scrolls. No one believed in them back then. They were thought of as quackery. Now they do. Modern science is not beyond the realms of possibilities, Miss Fox. If they discover the formula. Stanton wound up in Peru where he couldn't be extradited. DEREK: He built a villa. Paracelsus scrolls never turned up. Until recently. I don't think we're supposed to hear this. Guys like that don't just tell people things, Nigel. The rest you'll find out on a need-to-know basis. Right now, all you need to know is you're coming with me. And if I say no? You won't. If the formula works, it could impact the whole world. Nobody knows that it does. Nobody knows that it doesn't. I'll pick you up at 1400 hours. I was looking for my contact lens. You don't wear contacts, Claudia. Are you sure? Oh... Derek Lloyd seems to check out. Works in the Pentagon, USGI, like he said. I can't believe I met a real live mole. Claudia, I'm expecting a phone call from a friend of mine at the Pentagon. He's out in the field somewhere. You know a mole too? You know that besides looking for a way to make gold, the alchemists were also seeking eternal youth? Uh, look, it's almost time, Oh, my kind of people. Claudia, listen to me, this is very important. Okay. No matter where I am or what I'm doing, when my friend calls, you track me down. Gotcha. Understand? No, this is very important. He is going to be able to verify some things for me. Write it down. I already said "Gotcha." [EXHALES] Okay. Let's go. Right. You know, I worry about you out there sometimes, Nigel. Take care of everything. Everything. Right. [SMACKS HIS BUTT] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Didn't think you'd be on time. I'm full of surprises. Where is he going? No, he's not. With us. He's my assistant. Then he'll assist you somewhere else. He goes wherever I go. Not this time, Miss Fox. There is no need for him to know. Let's get going. He goes. Or I don't. Anything happens, United States Government will cover you. You're important to the mission. He is not. Just exactly where am I not going? [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MONKEYS HOWLING] I'm here to meet a contact that's going to lead us to Stanton's villa. Anything happens, stay out of it. [SHEEP BLEATING] [EXHALES] Conoco. Hello, Derek. Specialty of the house. Uh, there must be some mistake. We didn't order these. I can't drink this. Are you sure, Senor? Not really. It's a way of greeting new customers. That's very charming, but this isn't a drink, it's a zoo. You have to drink it. It's an insult if you don't. [BREATHING NERVOUSLY] You like? Very much. [COUGHING] [LOCALS LAUGHING] It's very good. Subtle, yet big. I mean, bold. Enjoy, Senor. We had a deal, Conoco. Not any more. I want to, uh... renegotiate. Fifteen hundred more. Not a penny over that. Take it or leave it. It's, uh, how do you say it, uh... a down payment. Another 1,000. Hey, where you going? Hey! We had a deal! [GRUNTING] Tell me where it is! All right! [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] He said we should stay out of it! They'll kill him. [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [YELLS] [BOTTLES BREAKING] [GRUNTING] Oh. Where'd you learn that? Ballet class. Duck! [GROANING] [HORN BEEPING] Up on the jeep, up on the jeep! We're on our own. Hurry! Come on, come on! Damn! Where are we going now? You'll know when we get there. It's no accident that tree fell the way it did. No, it's not. We're being watched. [LEAVES RUSTLING] Really? You sure? We're in the middle of nowhere. Oh, I'm sure. [LEAVES RUSTLING] [GUNS COCKING] [LEAVES RUSTLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Maybe you're right. Put your hands up. Where you going, gringos? Stanton's Villa, huraco. [CHUCKLING] You must be muy loco. And just why is that? 'Cause it's no man's land. SOLDIER: There's a war going on, gringos. This whole area is booby-trapped. Booby-trapped? How far is it? About three klicks. You'll never make it. We'll take our chances. How far is a klick? Never mind. I tell you what, Señor. I could use a little help moving this tree out of the way. I'm sure you can, Señor. [WHISTLES] [MOBILE PHONE RINGING] Ah, ah! Probably, uh, my mother. Hello? Nigel. NIGEL: Yes, what is it? You know this guy with the gun, Derek Lloyd? Claudia, I can't talk to you now. I've got some bad news. What is it? CLAUDIA: He's dead. Who is? Derek Lloyd. NIGEL: Claudia, this no time... No, that guy from the Pentagon called, Sydney's friend, he left a message. That's impossible. You must've misunderstood. No, I didn't. I wrote it down, just like Sydney told me to. What did he say? He said... Um... "Derek Lloyd is dead." What? He was murdered three days ago by another agent. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Nigel? Nigel? Back in the jeep. You all right? [ENGINE STARTING] Yeah, fine. Could be a shift in the entire balance of power. DEREK: Money markets flooded, world's economy is destabilized. [RADIATOR HISSING] Damn! What's wrong? It's like you've seen a ghost. I have. That's not Derek Lloyd. What? Derek's dead! Then who's he? Who knows? That call was from Claudia. Your friend from the Pentagon called, Derek Lloyd was killed three days ago by another secret agent. Stay calm. Don't let on. Just do what he says. But he's crazy! All the more reason not to confront him. We can't afford to let those scrolls fall into the wrong hands. He's a murderer. He won't try anything. He needs us to find the scrolls. He needs you. He doesn't need me. True, but I need you. Once we find the scrolls, we'll figure something out. Right now, this is bigger than just another relic. Right! Okay! Fixed, huh? Just like that? On foot. What? Can't be more than two klicks from here. How far is a click, again? Oh, wait a minute. I can call for help. [GRUNTING] Ah, you're choking me. Take your hands off of him. You place a call with your cell phone, it could be traced. You really want everyone tracking our position? We've wasted enough time. Start walking. SYDNEY: So, how is it that you've come to work for USGI? DEREK: [SIGHS] It's a long story. Long walk. Need-to-know, Professor Fox, need-to-know. Drink? No, thanks. You get dehydrated, you could get delirious. How much further is it? For you, maybe just a matter of feet. There are land mines everywhere. Don't worry, you'll be all right. Just stay on my tracks. My feet are sore, my throat is parched... Stop! Whatever you say! I won't complain any more, I promise! No, I mean, stop. Don't move, don't take another step, don't even breathe. You're standing on a land mine. You lift your foot and you will die. Well... Well... Um... Okay, Nigel, don't move. We need a rock. With you. I'm going to slide my knife between your boot and the pin. When I say three, you step off. You understand? Uh-huh. Okay. One, two... Whoa! Must have been a dud. Close. You can let go now. What if I say no? You won't. [SCREAMING] [DEREK LAUGHING] [COUGHING] [MUTTERING IN SPANISH] We've got to stay off the roads. This way. Shouldn't be much further. I don't know how many klicks I've got left in me. We get in, we get out, we do it all very quickly. How can you be so sure the place is abandoned? Hector assured me. You know that Paracelsus put the formula on two scrolls, light and dark, and magnetized the back with lodestone so they clamped together. No one ever heard of that before he did it. [GUNSHOT] Show yourself! Whoever did that saved my life. And was a crack shot. Maybe we should save this for dinner. In the meantime, let's get moving. We're being followed. This way. [LEAVES RUSTLING] Okay. Real simple, we get in, we get the scrolls, we get out. Uh-uh. I thought you said this place was empty. [LAUGHING] DEREK: Must have just moved in. This complicates things. [ENGINE REVVING] Looks like most of them are heading out on patrol. Good. Good, let's move a little closer. Follow me. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] No, you don't need to kill him. He didn't do anything to you. Lose the guns, Nigel, you're making me nervous. Let's go, come on. [DOOR CREAKING] SYDNEY: Looks like the place has been looted. Looks like they took almost everything. Well, let's hope not everything. War mask, fourth century. Used to chase away evil spirits. Doesn't look like it worked. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] There's got to be more to this place. These are his living quarters. There's got to be a lab of some kind. NIGEL: What are you doing? This was covered up. SYDNEY: A-R-T. Arthur. Why would he write his name on tiles on the floor? Why his first name? Doesn't make sense. Must be a code of some kind. Maybe it's a switch or a lever. The plaque. NIGEL: What plaque? For Paracelsus what is the symbol for Gold? On the periodic table of elements, it's A... U. [CLICKING SOUND] [DOOR CREAKING] SYDNEY: Look at this. All in search of a formula. [GUN COCKING] No! I could shoot it out of your hands, but I'm a lousy shot. [GUN COCKING] You're the one that killed the snake. Sydney, she's a rogue agent. All she wants are the scrolls. I'm here to save you, and to take him into custody. She's lying. Check her, I guarantee you she's wearing a tracking device. There'll be more coming, trust me. Check her, Nigel. What? SYDNEY: See if she's wearing a wire. Sorry. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Nigel. Nigel! [CRACKS] Standard practice in the field. He knows that. We know you're not Derek Lloyd. I had to assume another identity. It was a matter of survival. He killed Derek Lloyd. Go with him and he'll eventually kill you too. I am telling you the truth. He is lying. He doesn't care about the scrolls. She is right. I could care less about the scrolls. The only thing I care about is that they don't fall into the wrong hands. I have a job to do. Derek had a job to do. He is going to kill you once he gets the scrolls. She did save your life and, well, he... he saved mine. If you're trying to save our lives, why did you wait so long? No! There's always the court martial. Put her with the others. Wrong choice, Sydney. Move. You don't know what you're dealing with. [GRUNTS IN PAIN] [CHOKING] You're going to talk. I need to know. I need to know. I want answers and I want them now. Who are you and how do you know her? My name is Richard Watson. She's my superior at the agency. Derek and I were assigned to secure the scrolls. When Derek found out she was trying to steal them, she killed him. I was next. Why take Derek Lloyd's identity? [HEAVY BREATHING] For a while nobody knew he was dead, but her. When she canceled my access to the agency, I needed his to survive. [HEAVY BREATHING] Derek was my best friend. Sixteenth century Incan, used for burial ceremonies. SYDNEY: What's that behind the shelves? [TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING] Talk about the love of Gold. He did it. He turned himself into the thing he loved most. Gold. I don't think so. What are you doing? It's just a casket, made of solid Gold. [EXCLAIMING] SYDNEY: Well. SYDNEY: He didn't bury the scroll with him. Let's go. All right, there are two halves to the Paracelsus scrolls. That's right, light and dark, like yin and yang. You have the light side. Sun God. So, we're looking for the other half, the dark side. The dark side. What's that? I don't know. Like some sort of damper that soaks up all the light. It's a black hole. Chamber of Darkness. Entering the Gold room must have opened the dark side. Whoa! You're, uh, you're going in there? I have to. Wait. Here. I'll, uh, I'll... I'll just stay here. [WHOOSHING] Can you see anything? Guys? BOTH: There it is. DEREK: Solar eclipse. Total darkness. Here let me see that. [SHARP SOUND] [SCREAMING] Whoa! NIGEL: Come on! Sydney, we've got to move! Now! Sydney, come on! [BREATHING HEAVILY] You all right? Yeah. Blimey. Let's get out of here before we have company. Okay. Hello, Richard. I'll take them now. You backed the wrong guy, Sydney. Oh, I don't think so. Come on. [GRUNTING] Nigel! Ah! Wow. Uh! Ugh! [GRUNTING] Oh! [YELLS] Not bad. Ugh! Aah! [CHUCKLING] You guys enjoying the show? BOTH: Yeah. You better watch your back. [EXCLAIMING] [GRUNTS] Swipe the scrolls. Yah! Court martial? Better idea. You know, I can't believe you do this for living. Funny, I was going to say the same thing to you. [SNORING] So, what are you going to do now? I don't know. I can't go back to the agency. Take an early retirement, I guess. Besides, I don't think I'm cut out for this line of work any more anyway. Oh, I don't know about that. No, I do. You remember I had a chance to kill Turley and I didn't? Don't tell me you wish you had? No. Just the way I've been trained. Kill or be killed. What a horrible way to live. Actually, it's not. It's the only way. You only get to make one mistake. But now that I have a newfound conscience, probably get myself killed. Why don't you stay here? Fix up Stanton's villa? I'm sure you could hire yourself out to one side of the war or the other. Maybe I will. What about these? What are you going to do with these? [SIGHS] Turn them over to the government. You sure about that? I mean, what if the formula really works? What are they going to do with them? Not my need-to-know. Oh, no? Then whose need-to-know is it? Remember what happened when they split the atom? What are you suggesting? Well, scrolls only work together. SYDNEY: And since you found one and I found one, and we'll probably never see each other again... [ZEN MUSIC PLAYING] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
