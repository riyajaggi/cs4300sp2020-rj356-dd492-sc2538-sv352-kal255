 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] We must go. No. Without the golden twine we'll never get out of this place. [GROWLING] [BELLOWING] Oh my god. [SNARLS] Hi, Nigey, I'm back. Uh, pardon me. I'm filling in for Claudia while she's away.

 I'll be here for another week. Uh, another week? I'm Lynette. Remember me? Oh, yes. Of course. I remember you, Um... I'm very pleased to see you again. Ooh, that accent... Mm hm, yeah. Okay, well... CLAUDIA: I can get everything you need tomorrow. Slides, yeah. Projector, got it. And, the hotel's expecting you. And Nigel. Oh, okay.

 Don't worry, I've got everything written down. And, before you ask, I've already set up lunch with Ajax. SYDNEY: Ajax? Oh, Alex! Whatever, sorry. Claudia, can you also get me the latest brochure from the Athens Museum. I want to see how they're laying out their exhibits. You know? Specially the pottery antiquities. Syd! Gotta go. Tons to do, see you tomorrow. Ciao! Bye. I'd probably do anything a man with an English accent told me to do. Yeah? I couldn't help myself. No? No. Um... So, I uh... What I-- I should probably-- Wait. What? This just came for Professor Fox. Thank you. If they find evidence of the temple any further to the east I recommend extending the dig perimeter. All right. Or, call me if you need anything else researched. Bye. Nigel. Hello. What's the matter? Matter? Nothing, noting at all. It's uh... What a fine day at the university, the uh, campus's pristine student body is ready to work. When I said "student body", I didn't mean, body, as in... body... I meant, body. You meant Lynette. Yes. All of her, she's... Only with us while Claudia is in Greece. Thank God. Well, that does mean that we'll eventually get Claudia back. You know... It's gonna be a disaster, Claudia alone in Athens. Oh, she's gonna be fine. Sounds like she's completely organized. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] She's been begging me to go on one of these trips forever. I needed some advance work done, and she seemed like the logical choice. Sometimes a little responsibility is all someone needs to grow up. Her father's the biggest donor this university has. Okay? [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] You are the most beautiful woman in Greece. I... Don't. Words are inadequate. What's that? I don't know. Lynette said it just arrived. It came from Greece. Looks like it got mangled in customs. This stone once belonged to a God. Promise me you'll wear it forever. I... I will never take it off. My god, it's... It's beautiful. A Minotaur. Any idea who sent this photo? No. Doesn't it have a return address? No, but, it was sent from Athens. Claudia? Claudia can't send an inter office memo across campus, Nigel. It's cut from stone, it looks authentic, but, you can never tell without the real thing. Could the, uh, museum of Athens have sent it? No, I just got off the phone with them. No one said anything to me. And, this isn't the kind of thing you forget to mention. Wait. Who are you? I'm Stavros. But, you can call me Stav. Do you know the myth of the Minotaur? Of course, um, half man half bull... Banished to the labyrinth where he lived in an endless maze of tunnels. The maze was so complex, the gods created a golden ball of twines so that humans may find their way out. Hmm. Gods, monsters and fortunes, the Greeks certainly knew how to spin a tale. There's also another legend, not quite as well known. About? A key that could unlock the door to the Minotaur's maze. Really? It was supposedly cut from white marble found only on Crete. With a Minotaur carved on it. Does this look like marble to you? You think this is the key? It's only a Legend. But, legends do have basis in fact. Then who'd be sending it to you? And, why? * Baby boom-boom Let's have some fun * Belly to belly, Sweatin' in the sun * Sugar, you're so sweet * Jiggle and jiggle, You I've got to meet * A little look And you'll be mine * A little touch And I feel fine * A little kiss would Be just right * Come and play with me! * A little walk along the beach * A little Holdin' hands at least * If you want to fall in love * Come and play with me! * Why... you tantalize * I love that way you Walk that walk * I'm mesmerized * Honey, ooh, girl, You're cute * A little look And you'll be mine * I'm sure Claudia has a good explanation. I'm sure. Well, it's only been a-- Hour and a half. Oh, there she is. Am I late? Claudia, look at you. When was the last time you slept? Nobody sleeps in Greece. There's too much stuff to do. Bars to go to, parties to crash, men. Claudia I don't need to know this. I met the most handsome man in the world. Oh my god, he is so gorgeous. Tall, dark, his name is Stavy. That's so Greek. Where did you find that necklace? He gave it to me yesterday. Or, maybe the day before. SYDNEY: He? CLAUDIA: The hunk. Where? Here. Can I see it? Does, uh, the hunk have a last name? We didn't get that far. A man you met in a bar, gave a necklace like this to you? He said I was the most beautiful woman in Greece. I see. And, we didn't have sex or anything. He left too soon. Could I borrow this, just for a little while? I don't know. My friend Alex is an expert in ancient Greek arts. I'd be interested to see what he says about it. Fine. Well, why don't you go back to the hotel with Nigel. I'll wait for Alex. It is what you think it is. You're the most handsome man in the world. And, you're very beautiful as well. That's what Claudia called you. Why did you give her this necklace? Couldn't risk giving it to you myself. You're too visible, and so am I. It would've been too dangerous. So, you sent me the picture to get me intrigued. Yes. We must find the maze and the golden twine before others do. What others? Who are you? I'll be in touch. Speak to absolutely no one. And, guard this stone. Wait! [COCKS GUN] [GRUNTS] Don't move. Get off! Get off! SYDNEY: I missed you at the restaurant, Alex. [SIGHS] My faculty meeting ran long, Syd, I tried your cellphone. I was working on my tan. Somethings never change. Mm, I guess not. Long story. Um, I need your opinion on something. There's only one quarry in the world that produces this kind of marble. Don't tell me it's on Crete. SYDNEY: So? I know all the stories about the key to the maze, Sydney, they're just that. This isn't a key. What is it? It's a trinket. It's old certainly, probably 2,000 BC, maybe earlier. Where'd you get it? The handsomest man in the world. Some guy names Stavy. Stavros Vordalos? You know him? Everyone in Athens knows Stavros Vordalos. His father is one of the richest man in Greece. Dimitri Vordalos, the shipping magnet? Among other things. Don't get involved with Stavros or his father, they are feuding. You invited me to Athens to lecture on ancient Greek art. This is ancient Greek art. So, see you at the minister's reception in the park? Reception? The minister of culture, I told your secretary, what's her name? Claudia. [SIGHS] Don't tell me, it's fancy? Yeah. [SNORING] Is this okay? It's fine. You look lovely. Nothing's showing that shouldn't be? I'm not sure. I mean... Well, the dress is designed to show as much as it can, so... Uh, what shouldn't be showing? I don't have a clue. For all I know it could be on backwards. I hate this. I can't move, I can't breathe. I'm afraid I'll spill something on it and I'm spilling out of it. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] God. Pull your tongue back up, you might trip. Hundred thousand drachmas says the guy in the ice cream suit is Dimitri Vordalos. Stavros' father? And, behind him is my buddy from the beach. Sydney... It's nice to see you in something other than boots. You didn't tell me you knew Dimitri Vordalos. He funded the chair I hold at the university. Built the new library. We all know Dimitri. Let me introduce you to the minister of culture, he's very keen to meet the famous Sydney Fox. I'll get us a drink. I want to talk to you. I have nothing to say to you. Hey, talk about a small world. Yes, very. Would you excuse me a moment. Hey! You stole something from me. Get your hands off me. I want it back, Stavros. It's not yours. I paid a fortune for that necklace. The necklace doesn't belong to you, it belongs to Greece. It belongs to me! You are no more than a petty thief. Well father, we have more in common than I ever imagined. Throw him out, quietly. Don't talk to him. Don't talk to any of these people, they all work for my father. I can take care of myself. You can't trust anyone. Does that include you? Let's go, Stavy. Hey, let go of him. Oh! Go, I'll take care of it. [GRUNTS] We got to stop meeting like this. People will start talking. Are you all right? I'm fine. Did Stavros get away? I think so. What about Alex? Well, after the fight broke out, he herded the minister away. Alex is in on it. Nothing in his desk. How does a history teacher afford some of these pieces? Good question. He's acting like everything's fine, but, I know him. He's hiding something. Alex has always been a terrible actor. Played Macbeth in grad school, thought he was Olivier. I thought he was more like the lurch from The Addams Family. Hello. My Greek's pretty bad, how's yours? A little bit rusty, but, I'll give it a go. Um, it says... this is the work of a man called... Daedalus. Nigel... Daedalus is the architect that designed the Minotaur's maze. You think these are his... Blueprints. We can find the entrance. This will open the door. You always were a dreamer, Sydney, and far too curious for your own good. I'm not dreaming am I, Alex? The maze exists. Dimitri hired you to find it, didn't he? Don't get involved in this, Sydney. Why are you involved, Alex? You don't understand. No, I don't, why don't you tell me what happened so I make sure the same doesn't happen to me. Everyone works for Dimitri. He's like a god on Olympus, he controls things on Earth. So you sold your soul? So you could buy all these things that you're supposed to be spending your life protecting. You always saw things other people couldn't. Or wouldn't. Maybe that's why I invited you to Athens to teach me. I knew you'd probably tell me something I couldn't tell myself. Why don't you put that thing away. My god, Sydney. What am I doing? Stop it. Stop it, the two of you. He had a gun. Which he was about to give to me before you barged in. Now, what're you doing here, don't tell me you just stopping by. I followed you to make sure you were safe. He works for my father. You live off him. My father is paying the professor to find the maze. If he finds the maze, he'll loot it. I stole the key and brought it to you, because, I couldn't stand the idea of someone destroying something so precious... For money. So, that's what this was all about. Why didn't you tell me this before? We didn't exactly get a chance to discuss it until now. I felt the same way about what Dimitri was doing, that's why I haven't told him about the Daedalus plans. He doesn't know you have these? No! A colleague of mine got it from a farmer who found it buried in a cave. My father would kill you if he knew you had those and hadn't told him. Well, we aren't gonna tell him. Are we? What kind of a man of you think I am? I have no idea. What kind of a man are you? Let's get to work. All of us. This must be the Minotaur's lair. I still can't get over how many tunnels there are. Makes the Paris subway system look like a walk in the park, doesn't it? Someone could get lost down there forever. Many did. This is king Minos of Crete, he banished the Minotaur to the maze. The maze could be anywhere. Myth says, King Minos built the maze on Crete. True, but, Daedalus never left Athens. As a boy he had nightmares about drowning. So... A boat trip to Crete would've been out of the question. Uh, that narrows down the field. Sort of... Can anyone translate this? "As in the light above so in the darkness below". Darkness below? He must be talking about the maze. Lovely, but, why won't he tell us where he built it? I've seen these words before. You have? It's ancient Greek. It hasn't been used in over 3,000 years. Where did you see the words? I can't remember. Sorry. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Damn, it's right there sitting on the edge of my brain. Well, maybe if you don't push so much it'll come to you. Maybe Alex will come up with something. Are we going back to the hotel? Yeah. Oh, there's a cab. [WHISTLES] Wait here. Claudia? Must've been a wild night. There you are. I've been looking all over Athens for you. I saw him first, basic rules of dating. We're not dating Claudia, we're working. In that dress? At six o'clock in the morning? The park. That's where I saw those words. The park where we were yesterday. We need to borrow your cab, Claudia. Fine, but I'm coming with you. We need to make one stop along the way. At a place that sells fishing gear. I grew up not far from here. When I was a boy my nannies brought me here nearly everyday. I pretended this was Mount Olympus and I was a god. You are. STAVROS: Look. Look. It's just as I remembered. What was this place, Stavros? It was a temple dedicated to Prometheus. Then why is King Minos' head sitting on top of that arch? King who? Minos. He was the King of Crete. His wife Pasiphae was cursed by Poseidon and fell in love with a bull. Isn't that against the law? Sydney, what're you doing? I'm going up to take a look around. God, what a showoff. The necklace fits. Lovely, but now what? Hey! Sydney, there's a door down here. My god, Sydney, you've done it. Unbelievable. It's totally cold down here. And dark. Do you have a light? No. So, uh... Where do you think this tunnel leads? Only one way to find out. Daedalus's book got us in here, hopefully our fishing line will get us out. Hopefully? Ooh, what exactly do you think she meant by hopefully? Here you go Nigel. Ready, I suppose. Who drew these things? The Minotaur. And the Minotaur would be... A creature that was half man and half bull. Half bull? Looks like a site of a massacre. Or, a dinner party. I don't understand The Minotaur ate people that got lost in the maze. What is it? These aren't human bones. What are they? Primate of some kind but definitely not human. Are you saying the Minotaur ate monkeys? No, I'm saying like I feel like it's staged. Like these things were planted here. To scare people. World's first haunted house. [SCREAMS] Oh, my god. Well, that's human. It's disgusting. Sydney look, it's a door. And, how do we open it? There's got to be a lever or something. Two in a row. That's what I love about the Greeks, they're so consistent. [RUMBLING] SYDNEY: Some kind of communal gathering place. There's more than one Minotaur? Look at the walls. What is this? They weren't Minotaur at all. Or monsters. They were just physically deformed in some way. They must've established a society where they lived amongst each other without fear of judgment from the outside world. The ancient Greeks did worship physical beauty. So they were outcasts. CLAUDIA: Because of the way they looked? That's so mean. God! NIGEL: Sydney, look at this. It's a broken pot on a pedestal. The golden twine. It exists as well. Your father is going to quite pleased, Stavros. You've led us right to the twine. He's not gonna get any of this. Your father gets anything he wants. You should know that. What're you gonna do, shoot me? Of course not, Stavy... You're family, but, the others... What is he doing? Nothing... yet. Get the twine. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] Let's get out of here. Come on. Hurry up, come on, come on. Come on! That should keep them for a while. Let's go. Don't lose sight of the fishing line. They left us here to die. Now what? Maybe we won't be alone. [SCRAPING AGAINST ROCK] Do you hear that? What is that? Hooves, it sounds like hooves. [SHUSHES] NIGEL: That's the end of our fishing line. Those guys back there must've been rewinding it. We're like lost, aren't we? No, we just can't figure our way out. But, we'll figure it out right? I mean, that's what you do, isn't it? You find your way into places like this and then you get out? We've got about a half hour's light left. Let's get moving while we can still see where we're going. What happens once the torches go out. So, which way? Who knows. No one knows, that's who. Someone said people who get lost down here get eaten, who said that? That's part of the myth, Claudia. It didn't really happen. How do you know? The myth also said that the twine would help people find their way out of the maze. If it was tied to something at the entrance like our fishing line, the twine by itself is useless. I wonder. Sydney, you don't actually think that it's going to-- Move? Yeah, right, duh. CLAUDIA: It's moving. It's not moving, it's rolling. We must be on a slight incline. Well, who cares if it's moving or rolling. It's going somewhere. You feel that? It's a breeze. Fresh air! It's the light at the end of the tunnel You are amazing. Finding the maze might have been the easiest part. Now we've got to protect it. DIMITRI: Not to worry professor Fox. I will make sure the maze gets the best care that money can buy. Is that all you care about, Father, making more money? This is nothing to do with money. I have more money than I will ever need. Then what's it about? It's about power. Of course, you would understand professor. It is about being the best. The world will soon know that Dimitri Vordalos found the maze of the Minotaur. Oh. Will you tell the world about the golden twine also? Ah! To the victor go the spoils, Stavros. When I was a boy I looked up to you, I wanted to be just like you. [SPITS] [SIGHS] Finally. [GASPS] What kind of trick is this? What happened to the twine? It's gone. What are you talking about? The gods created the twine to guide those of good heart and true spirit. Like the people that lived in the maze. But, for people like you, it's useless. You'll always be lost. This is your fault. This is about no one but you, Father. And, what you've become. I used to hate you, but, now I just feel sorry for you. He won't be a problem. It's over. This is over. But, that thing between you and your father. Yes, I know, Sydney, that's just beginning. It's a start. It's a shame we lost the golden twine. It was a magnificent find. NIGEL: I guess we should go. SYDNEY: You're right, Nigel, it was a great find. Maybe some things just aren't meant to be in a museum. I haven't heard a word from Stavy, I mean, he said he'd call. Then I'm sure he will. He was gonna take me to this island with this amazing caves. I mean, people live there for weeks with no clothes, no phones, nothing. God, why would anyone want to do that? A week without clothes with Stavy. Total no brainer, Nigel. Speak of the devil. CLAUDIA: He's here. With another... Oh. God. Claudia, guys like Stavros are like crash diets... they're so full of hope and promise but, in the end they never work. What would you know about diets? I was just using it as an example. You don't understand Sydney, I like... dug Stavros. I mean this wasn't some bimbo infatuation on a totally gorgeous hunk. Of course not. He meant something to me. Something important. You didn't really know him, Claudia. I knew Stavros. In my heart. We were like soul mates. The real question is whether you even need a man like Stavros in your life. You're kidding, right? No. Stavros was a god. I will never find someone like him again. Gods make lousy boyfriends. Oh, my god. Well, my tan's starting to fade. Time to hit the beach again. Ciao! Hi. Another crash diet? Let's hope she doesn't starve. A Greek Tragedy, please. Yes, ma'am. Seems appropriate somehow. Make that two. Yeah, okay.
