 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES What's up? Is something wrong? No. I forgot my phone. I came over without my phone. Now, you calm down. Okay? Calm down and we can have a nice talk, okay? Sis! Sis, I think we should talk now. Look... Look, there is no explaining what I did. Regret is in no way a solution...

 Cansu. Hush. Calm down. We're sisters, okay? Nothing will change that. You did what you did, and we'll sort it out. Okay? Now I'm going to get my phone. Okay? Later we can talk to our hearts' content. Sis. I don't know if there will be a later. Cansu, don't be ridiculous. Don't scare me. I love you so much. Chill.

 Come over, let me teach you. Come on. I think you should tell me whose daughter Cansu is. What are you trying to say? Who is Cansu's family? Look... Because of the orphanage rules, we can't... Dad, I know you didn't adopt her from an orphanage. I remember this pink blanket and the shoes you were wearing the day you brought Cansu home. We all have the right to the truth, especially Cansu. Did you find Cansu at a car crash? What did you have to do with it? Where are you getting this from? Do not tell me it's the illness. Please, not you too. Atiye. I don't know what you've heard, what you know, but... forget about it, alright? Sometimes people are happy with what they don't know, not what they do know. It's a can of worms nobody wants to open. Do you understand? Do you think Erhan was happy when he grew up all alone? Or Cansu? Wouldn't she be happy to know her brother was alive? Okay Dad, keep quiet, but I will find out the truth. I'll get a DNA test done if necessary. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Close the door. Close it. Here. I don't know what you know or have heard but everything you want to find out is in here. They wanted to sweep this under the rug, but I hid it. Because I knew something would come of it one day. It... It was a murder that was made to look like an accident. The murdered family were shot at close range. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. Then they cleaned it all out, destroyed all the evidence. They said it was a state secret. I wanted to object, but... they threatened my family, my life. I did what I had to. I kept quiet. I kept quiet. What about Cansu? I couldn't leave her like that. Who are you? Come here, come on. Come here. Even in that state, she was smiling at me. I swear she was. As if she was asking me to save her. But I knew those men wouldn't let her be. I was scared for her. I didn't question her past, even named her myself. Didn't you ever investigate who did it? I did. I did investigate, but they were so professional. They covered it up, I couldn't find a thing, couldn't find anything. Maybe they were after what Erhan's father found. I don't know... The only thing I know is... that these people will do anything to reach their goal. Look, Atiye. My dear, please promise me... that you'll forget all of this. Okay? You won't tell anyone, promise? Dad, don't ask this of me. It's their right to know each other. You still don't get it. This all happened for a reason. That man didn't find you for nothing. That's why you need to stay quiet. I beg you. If you love your sister, if you have any compassion for her, stay quiet. Okay? Cansu. Good morning. Morning. What is it? Why did you want to meet me? Your face is pale. Is something wrong? If it's because of me, I'm sorry I bothered you this early. No, it's just morning drowsiness. You know me. Is it Cansu? What's she doing? She passed out, I couldn't wake her. So nothing's wrong? No, Ozan. - Where are you going? - The restroom. I'll be back. Hi, sis. I wish we'd had the chance to speak face-to-face. Hi, sis. I wish we'd had the chance to speak face-to-face. However, no matter how frank or tactless I am... it seems I wasn't brave enough to say this to your face. Okay, I'm listening. I'm sorry to insist... but I can't get the thought of losing you out of my head. I mean, I can't work, can't sleep, can't think... I only think of you and... I can't go on waiting for an answer, Atiye, so... tell me: Are we getting married or not? Ozan... I... Atiye. We can sort everything out. Look, we just need to take one step forward. I won't be the man who fixes everything with money. I'll be whatever you want me to be. This isn't working anymore. It was a mistake to let it go this far. We're not alike. True love is complementing each other. We went on as long as we did because of your interest, your love. But now we're not going anywhere. I feel... so much freer since I ran away from the wedding. Atiye, please don't talk like that. It's not true. What you went through, and that man, it's confusing you. - It's nothing to do with anyone else. - Atiye, we love each other. You believed I was sick up until yesterday. Look how different reality was. I can see now. We grew up together, but we weren't able to get to know each other. Atiye, my love. Listen. Think about this again, for old times' sake. Please. I'm not the old Atiye anymore. Nothing can be the way it was. This is... truly the right thing for us both. - No. - Let us go our separate ways. Atiye. Atiye... You're very talkative today. My mind is a bit all over the place. Yeah, I know, being quiet is nice sometimes. Never mind me, are you okay? I can't get my head around who would kidnap my sister, or why. Are you upset you found out? Should I be happy? I don't know. Is she dead, alive? Anything's possible. They say those who don't question can't find truth. At least you have hope now. Yes, but... they also say questioning can destroy your life. My life will be spent thinking about where this girl is, or what she's doing. Of course I'd like to know the truth. But only if it wouldn't hurt her. Is that what you thought as well? Well, we are talking about people who wrapped up a doll and made it look like a dead baby. Who else thinks like that? Me. It occurred to me as well. Do you see that star? Yes, Atiye. You're not crazy. I see it. And do you see how bright it is during daylight? Yes, that's the Sirius constellation. The brightest of them all. Sometimes it reaches such a position that it can be seen during the day. In the old days, people thought it foreshadowed an upcoming disaster. But, of course, our scholar does not believe that. It doesn't matter what I believe, actually. Because every holy book or text talks about the stars. The verses my dad pointed out do as well. Verses? I didn't show you, did I? Come on. Among my dad's stuff from his office in Göbekli Tepe was a tape, and on it, these numbers were recorded by him in Syriac. I found out they correlate to some of the verses in the Quran but I can't work out the connection. Maybe you should think of it in a simpler way? What do you mean? Maybe your dad only wanted to point towards the Quran? Yes. Could be. There was one here. Here. What's this? Wait a minute. I didn't notice this. It looks like a cryptex from the Ottoman Empire. They were used to keep secrets safe from enemies. So the pages we've been looking for... Are probably inside the cryptex. Stop! Wait, don't tamper with it. If we make a mistake we could damage what's inside. How are we going to open it then? I guess with these numbers. There are a lot of numbers here. We need the right combination. My dad probably left another clue somewhere. Son! What happened to you? Ozan! Dad, yet again, I couldn't do shit. Atiye left me. She left you and you just said okay? You couldn't convince her to stay? I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you! All this wealth, this splendor... What is it you're lacking, son? What girl could say no to you? All you had to do was marry this girl, and you couldn't even do that! You won't lose Atiye, you hear me? You have no other future but her. Dad, I slept with Cansu. And Cansu will tell Atiye. You fucking moron! How could you do this to me? Dad, no. Dad, don't. Okay, Dad, I'm sorry. Dad. Dad, Dad, I'm sorry. Dad, I'm sorry. Don't you dare! How quickly you forget. If there is one emotion that defines a person more than love, it's pain. Pain! Pain! You will go to Cansu... and you will do whatever it takes to silence her. I love wind chimes. So did Elif. My sister. My dad bought it because she cried a lot when she was little. He would walk around beneath it with her. When she quietened down, I'd start. Why is that? I was jealous, of course. Poor man, then he'd have to walk around with a kid in each arm. Like us. Cansu suffered from my jealousy too. I couldn't accept her at first. Didn't even look at her. But then we got used to each other. I wonder how we would have been. Things are different when you're an orphan. You wait in the corner, willing to show everyone love... but those same people always prioritize someone else. Is that why you confuse love and mercy? Maybe it's because I never knew love. Who could know it without experiencing it? Love can't be described, only experienced. Good morning. Good morning to you. Why are you looking at me that way? It can't be described, only experienced. Tu ki ye? Who are you, Atiye? That star... You have the mark on the back of your neck. Right here. How have I never seen this before? Is it genetic? Does your mother have one? I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Cansu can't have it, anyway. I need to go. I know some of the police. I'm not sure what will come of it, but they may know something about my sister. Erhan... I need to start somewhere. Erhan, I need to tell you something. Okay. Yes? Cansu is your sister. What? - Where are you going? - Move. - Cansu... - I said move. Cansu. What do you think you're doing? Why are you here? To knock some sense into you. Do you realize what would have happened if that video had reached Atiye? She didn't see the video? No, I deleted it before she saw it. - Good for you. - Cansu. Cansu, do you realize what you're doing? Atiye won't forgive you. And neither will your parents. Don't you worry, I've thought of everything. I won't let my sister build a life on a lie. Cansu, am I the lie? I'm Atiye's best chance in life. You're her best chance? Who the hell are you? You're nothing. - Without your dad, you don't even exist. - Cansu... How do people introduce you? As Serdar Yılmaz's son. - Serdar Yılmaz's one and only heir. - Cansu... - When do they call you by your own name? - Cansu! - What? - Careful. I'm sorry, but someone has to tell you this. About how they talk behind your back, they call you a puppet. If not, you'll spend your entire life living in your dad's shadow. Cansu, shut up! What? I've said my piece. Do whatever you want! Now move. - You can't go. - I said leave. - Cansu! - Ozan! Cansu. Cansu. Let go... What, what? Ozan... Cansu... Cansu! Look at me, look at me. Cansu! - Ozan, help... - Cansu. Look at me, look at me. Okay, okay... Cansu... Fuck... Are you still mad at me? What can I do? I was worried about them still being after Cansu. I was scared of endangering her. You said the same thing, remember? Still, you should have told me. Why don't you just enjoy the moment now? Let's talk about this later. Am I wrong? You are so like Cansu. She becomes dead set on something just like this. I'll park and join you. Let me talk to her first. So she won't be shocked to death. I'll call you. Cansu? Cansu... Cansu! Cansu. Cansu! Hello. Where is Atiye Özgürsoy's house? Atiye? Atiye... She's not breathing! Cansu's not breathing! Fuck! Atiye. Atiye, we need to leave. Atiye, this is a trap. Listen to me, the cops are here. We can't do anything now, okay? Is there a back door? Is there a back door? Okay. Come on. Come on. I'll bring the car. Wait for me here, okay? Of course, I'll be right over. Have a good day. They're calling me in to testify. I killed her. Don't ever say that again. You wanted to warn her. She insisted and she caused this accident. People finding out about this won't do anything but get you wrongfully punished. We will do just as I say and everything will be easily solved. Do you understand? I can't believe she is dead... You did your best, son. But she couldn't handle it. There is nothing we can do for her now. Let's concentrate on saving your life. Atiye! Atiye, talk to me! Let's go back. We can't go back! They're trying to pin the murder on you! - Let's go back, Erhan. - Atiye, we can't. I found your ring next to Cansu. Here. Who did you give this to? Atiye? Atiye, say something. Ozan wouldn't. He couldn't... I'm calling Professor Öner, and taking you to him. Then I'll find whoever is behind this. No, my daughter couldn't have done this, Inspector. Atiye couldn't have done it. They grew up as sisters. They loved each other. I understand your pain, Mr. Mustafa. However, all the evidence we found at the house, and the confession tape Cansu sent to her sister, unfortunately make Ms. Atiye a suspect. They should never have met. Now one daughter is going in the ground, the other to prison because of that woman. They're coming! Guys, enough! Here he is. Mr. Serdar! Are there any developments with the murder case? Are there any developments with the case, Mr. Serdar? Please, let us through. We're in great pain. Statements will be made in due course. Mr. Mustafa! Mr. Mustafa! You fucking son of a bitch! What did you want from my daughter? Motherfucker! - Sir! - Asshole! Fucking microbe! - Get away! Move! - Mr. Mustafa! You'll be going to prison! You! Not Atiye, you! Get out of my way! - Mr. Mustafa. - Let go! - Asshole! - Mr. Mustafa! Chief. Here's the message Ms. Cansu sent. Hi, sis. I wish we'd had the chance to speak face-to-face. However, no matter how frank or tactless I am... it seems I wasn't brave enough to say this to your face. I was in love with Ozan. And you knew this... before your relationship began. I thought I'd keep it to myself, bury it deep inside, but I couldn't. I slept with Ozan after you ran away from the wedding, and needless to say, now I am paying for it with a guilty conscience. I won't drag this out or pain you with my existence. This means... that I'm leaving. Just so you know. I think that's all. I'm sorry. If it still means anything to you... I love you very much. You've seen the video. It's anyone's guess. It is not our aim to accuse or to judge anyone. With this video... Atiye. Calm down, dear. Calm down. Come here. Come on. Get up. I'll get you some water, okay? MOM Mom, help me. I told you, didn't I? I told you to let this go, that more deaths would follow. Yes, but I didn't listen. But I'm innocent. How could I ever hurt Cansu? Atiye. Your grandmother was sick. It's genetic in our family. You could've done anything when you were not yourself. This doesn't make you a bad person. But you should be under observation, for a while at least. You really think I killed Cansu. Unbelievable. Don't follow me. Atiye! I'm only doing what's right! What's happening? Some rest will do you good. Please understand. Cansu? Cansu... Cansu! Cansu. Cansu! Can you hear me? Atiye Özgürsoy! You are under arrest! Handcuff her. Don't worry, Mrs. Serap. You did the right thing. Subtitle translation by Didem İpekoğlu
