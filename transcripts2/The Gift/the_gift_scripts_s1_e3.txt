 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Let's go. Have we come to the right place? It looks a bit strange. I guess we are a bit on edge... No. The woman I see in my dreams is real, and someone attacked you for a notebook. These are all very ordinary things. Don't worry, it will all become clear now. It must be up ahead. Good evening, sorry to bother you. We are looking for Zühre Altın, she lives here.

 Zühre? No one by that name lives here. They gave us this address. Here, this is her. Maybe she lived here before you. Or maybe she lives in the neighborhood. No, madam. I don't know who this is. I've lived here so long, I'd know if she lived here too. I'm sorry I couldn't help. Good evening, thanks. Maybe she moved away years ago. What's up? Don't you hear that? What is it? He's hiding something. What are you doing?

 Hey, Atiye... If he's hiding something, he won't tell you. Atiye! Where... Atiye, where are you going? Atiye? What are you doing? No way. Do you make a habit of going where you shouldn't? Do you make a habit of talking when you shouldn't? Atiye, the guy is in there! How will you get the door open? My father owns a security company. Atiye! Atiye, you've come at last. Welcome. Atiye. We need to go on a trip together. Atiye... Come on! Now go, Atiye. Come back for me later. Later. Go now. Atiye... Atiye, why won't you tell me what happened? That woman was there. Then what? Who is she? She's my grandmother. How can she be? She scratched the same symbol on the wall. But she is blind. I don't understand. Did you really see your grandmother there? - You don't believe me, do you? - I do. I mean... I want to believe you, Atiye. I'm trying to understand. I'm trying to understand too. So, was she your grandmother? I really don't know. How could you not know? Because I've never met my grandmother. Then why are we leaving? Let's bring her with us so we can talk. - No, we can't. - Why? Why can't we go back? As far as I know, my grandmother is dead. She passed away before I was born. That's what they said... So, there must be something I don't know, or I don't understand. I don't know, Erhan. Please, don't ask me anything else. Let's not do anything else tonight. Just take me home, please. Okay, as you wish. Where were you, Atiye? Where? Are you trying to give me a heart attack? I'm here now, okay? Okay? Okay! Do you know what we've been going through these last few hours? Leaving in the dead of night. Getting back at dawn. We called a thousand times and you don't bother picking up! Sweetie. We were very worried, so scared. - Don't do anything like this again. - Okay, I'm sorry. I'm back in one piece. Sis, if you hadn't shown up Mom was going to tell the cops you'd gone missing. Mom, I saw a woman tonight. I've seen her before. This woman said she's my grandmother. It's true, right? I mean, you said she was dead. But she's alive. You didn't know, did you? This is getting complicated. Mom, say something! Did you know, or not? You didn't take your meds, did you? What does that mean? I saw this woman. Atiye, your grandmother died years before you were born. I put my mother in her grave with my own hands. You were having hallucinations again. No, it can't be. I saw this woman, talked to her. Atiye, enough, please. Don't ruin your life with these ridiculous things. Mustafa, call the doctor. Don't! Don't treat me like I'm crazy. I saw this woman, talked to her, touched her. My hands still smell like her. Atiye, you're scaring me. Please stop. - Sweetie, let's tell the doctor. - I won't go to the doctor! We're going to see that woman and you'll see I'm not crazy! Okay, honey. - Come on, Dad, let's go! - Don't be ridiculous! It's the crack of dawn! If you want to go, we'll go tomorrow. Fine. Tomorrow. And if there is no such woman? Then I will do as you say. You'll see the doctor? I will. I will accept that I am mentally ill, and will take the drugs, and I'll go to hospital if need be, alright? Professor... A phone call wasn't enough? No. - That notebook had more... - Listen. You're just like your father. Independent, obstinate, and always asking questions. You had that notebook for years. You said that picture was in it. So please, think hard. You must know something. I don't know. I don't know anything about that woman or the lost pages. I only glanced at that notebook once and didn't understand anything in it. When you showed me that embossment, that is when I remembered that it looked like something Nazım had drawn. That's all. This woman has something to do with my father and Göbekli Tepe. I need to find out about this. Did he not tell you anything? - He was your best friend. - No, he wasn't! I am angry with your father. Very angry. We were estranged when he died. They cut support for Göbekli Tepe because of your father's ridiculous nonsensical theories and his individualistic actions. Your father wrecked my career as well. He'd gone completely mad in his last days. Do you know what he wrote about you in that notebook? "Öner is the person I trust most. I can share my findings solely with him. He is the best scientist I know." It's clear you haven't read it, or you wouldn't say those things. Besides, my father didn't go mad. He found something very important, that would shake the world. This I know. I know he did! ERHAN ARCHAEOLOGIST DELETE FROM CONTACTS? CANCEL / DELETE "For some, the constellations are manifestations of God in different dimensions. It is also indicated that the octagonal star is a symbol representing heaven." Octagonal star... What did you find, Dad? What is the star the symbol of? This is it. Come here! I'll show you when I catch you! Bastards. Hi there, are you looking for someone? Good morning. I was here last night. Last night? You weren't here, but your husband was. Could be. I'll call him. Adem? Adem, come here for a second! I'm going to check your basement. I know the way. Where are you going, miss? Miss? But... She was here last night. Miss, what's going on? What are you looking for? Where's Zühre? What did you do to Zühre? Honey... - You again? - What have you done to my grandmother? I told you last night, there is no such person here. You're lying! It wasn't like this! If you're hiding something... No, there's no one here. She's not here. You're lying! She was here yesterday! Enough! She was here yesterday! She was here, Dad! I swear she was here! What is all this? Okay, okay. She was here. I swear she was here. This place wasn't like this before. My grandmother was here. Atiye... Well, what do you think about all of this? I don't know. I was so sure everything I saw was real, but she was gone. Everything was different. Either I'm really sick, or there are things we don't know about. Like what? I don't know what. But believe me, I am just as curious as you are. Look, Ms. Atiye. We haven't always known how these types of illnesses affect the brain, therefore, treatment wasn't always very successful. However, in recent years, it's been found that these illnesses cause defects in the brain's enzyme system. Symptoms like the hallucinations you are seeing develop because of this defect. The medication I gave you will fix that system completely. Please. I ask you to trust the medicine and take the pills I gave you regularly. Sweetie, are you all right? Absolutely. You will be fine, believe me. I wish someone believed me. Everything was so beautiful when we first came here. It will be again, sweetheart. Everything will be great. When you start your medication today, everything will be sorted. Atiye, darling, we have lovely days ahead of us. We're getting married. We're going on our honeymoon. Let's focus on our blessings from now on, shall we? Atiye! I was worried when I didn't hear back. Did you speak to your family? There's no such person. I don't follow. I went back to that house. She's not there. What I saw was a delusion, there is no such woman. There is. Her name is in Dad's notebook. There's a picture of her! But she's not there. She's in a grave. Anyway, why do you even believe me? I told you my mental state is not right. Why shouldn't I believe you? Besides, you were so sure of yourself that day. Whatever. I'm not involved anymore. Zühre, the symbol... I can't deal with it. You're giving up. I'm going back to my life. I understand, you're scared. I'm getting married. So, you coming to Göbekli Tepe, drawing that symbol, was all for nothing? I have a lot to do. My dad wouldn't have written your name in his notebook for nothing. All of this means something. It has to. Not for me, not anymore. Fine, as you wish. I thought you were looking for answers, but you don't want to turn your life upside down. No, I don't. "How do you know your life wouldn't be better turned upside down?" said Shams-i Tabrizi... But it's your choice. It's one after the other. Have you also come to see the house? If that's alright? It's alright. Go ahead. Come on. I couldn't explain last time either. Go on, man. If the bank has plans such as these for the future then we don't need the legislature's approval. Okay. I will call the minister tomorrow. Come in! - Bye. - Good evening, Mr. Serdar. Is it good, Akrep? You tell me. Did you bring what I asked? Wow. You've succeeded once again. Good job. There is nothing I won't do for you, Mr. Serdar. - Did they notice anything? - No. There is something missing, Akrep. Missing? But I took whatever I could find. There are no buts! Don't use that word. Everything you say after "but" is meaningless. Shit! You will find the missing pages, got it? That archaeologist probably has them. I'll be abroad until the wedding. I want them when I return. Yes, sir. You have never disappointed me, Akrep. Don't start now. Don't worry, sir. You can trust me. Welcome! There's food for you. - Thanks. What are you cooking? - Dried beans. Oh, brilliant. - Sir, welcome. - Hello, Celal. - Mr. Erhan. - Thanks, Oktay. Celal, I need to ask you something. Do you know this woman? No, I don't know a woman like this. Come on, sir, the food is ready. I'm coming. You start, I have something to do. - Professor? - Yes. What are you looking for? What is it? Well, Celal, a lot of weird stuff is happening. This is everything left by my father, right? Yeah, that's it. You took the rest to Istanbul. There's nothing else. But there is. For example, Professor Öner gave me a notebook of my father's. I never knew about it. There might be other things too. Professor Öner? Really? Why did Professor Nazım give him the notebook? Everyone always said they fell out after that day. What day? Öner came with a committee. I guess they were getting funds for this place with Nazım. But when Nazım saw that woman, he never even met with the committee. Hold on, what? Woman? What woman? A woman came. I didn't see her myself. They said she was a blind woman. Blind? Yeah. Is her name Zühre? I don't know that, sir. Celal, think. When did this happen? Honestly, I don't know, sir. It was a long time ago. Our digs had begun maybe a year or so prior. Probably sometime around '95. Is there no one who saw or spoke to this woman? I heard this story from our security guard, Hayati. He said she was cursed. If anyone would know, he would. But it has been years since I saw Hayati. I don't know what he's doing anymore. Celal, find me this Hayati. The person you have called is currently unavailable. Please try again later. Or better yet, don't try at all. I saved you from our parents because you wanted to be alone. But if you're going to be moody, I'll bring them back. I wish I could be like you. Like me? Are you sure? You can find something to mock in anything. It's because I was born crazy, instead of becoming it later in life like you. If you go crazy later on, it's problematic, you know. I've put years into this. Sis... You're a beautiful angel A flower in every heart You're a beautiful angel A flower in every heart Flower. Atik. You're a beautiful angel A flower in every heart You stole my strategy. Don't think I didn't notice. You calmed me down like this whenever I was sad. Then Mom would get angry with you. Right, that's enough. - Enough! - Okay. You've filled my emotional quota for the year. Have your drink. Come on, please. Okay. I have a question. Do you think it is the right thing to do, to go on with my life like none of this ever happened? Sis... Well... I can't tell you what is right or wrong. Just that... you're loved by all of us and you have a great life ahead of you. Girls' night? Music? I'm putting on music. - I'll play some music. - Glad you're here, dork. You too. Coffee party. Thank you. - Enjoy. - Enjoy, sir. You look worried, sir. Nah, it's nothing. Shall I make coffee, sir? Thanks, tea is enough. Thanks. - How is your family? - They are fine. I swear you brought the rain from Istanbul. Good night. Yeah. Good night. Hey! Stop! Celal! Thief! There's a thief! He came out of my trailer. I wonder if he took anything. Maybe he was the scumbag who stole Professor Nazım's notebook. God, who are these people? I don't know, Celal. But that book is worth its weight in gold. Maybe my dad solved the secrets of Göbekli Tepe. Really? Look, these symbols here are biological symbols, DNA and such. I don't know the link, but they look like the symbols we found. Look, these are the areas we found today. Okay? You put the star... They fit the four points of the star. Maybe Göbekli Tepe is shaped like a star. There's still a lot to dig up. Then there is the embossment of the girl with the star. Atiye says she saw a girl with a star. Whatever this star symbolizes, maybe it'll show us the way. And I am not the only one who knows this. My dad wasn't talking nonsense. I know it. ALARM - Sir... - Yes. No leads from the license plate. The car was a rental. But I have good news. What is this? Hayati's number. Let's see. She's a healer. Saved my wife from her deathbed. Her body was healed, but her soul got sick. Never saw the light of day again. Became something of a lunatic. May the devil take her. Well, did my father ever tell you what connection this woman has to Göbekli Tepe? Mr. Nazım wouldn't tell me much. One time he said, "The woman is in the heart of this place." Zühre is not there. She's very far away. Who are you? How do you know? I was healed by her. I visit her every year. Her place is secret. No one knows. Where is it? By the mosque. Go there. Which mosque? Abdullah El Ensari Mosque. She's there. Hey, there. Hey, there. See you. Look at that gown I designed. Brilliant. Maybe you should slow down. The night is still young. "Slow" and "Cansu." Please, do they sound good when said together? I don't think so. I don't know if they sound good, but "Cansu" will look great on the soles of these shoes. I forgot! I'm an idiot. It's the most important part of the wedding. But I know exactly what to write. - Put Aslı and Dişa's names. - Forget about them. I'll write my name all over, so it will be erased at least once. About time my husband showed up! Checking on my bride, who isn't ready. I'm marrying the most beautiful woman on Earth. Ugh. I'll leave the couple to it. - You're very handsome. - You're very beautiful. We fixed the Casa Port issue. I'm relying on you for the Doha Port bid. Mr. Akrep is here, sir. Tell him to wait. But don't worry, we will take care of it. It's very beautiful. I really love it... but there was no need. Well, you are becoming Ozan Yılmaz's wife. You're Atiye Yılmaz now. You should have the best and most beautiful of everything, shouldn't you? Thank you. Aren't you scared of marrying someone like me? Like you? A nutcase. I know it will be fine as long as you take your meds. So... You're saying never without the drugs? Atiye, can we drop this, please? Look, I don't want any problems on our most beautiful day, please. The marriage officiant will be here in an hour. Your father will walk you down the aisle as planned, then we'll meet. Okay? Let's talk. Did you come empty-handed? Don't tire yourself in vain. I got my answer. - There is something I should tell you. - Yes? They saw me. But I threw them off the trail. You said "but" again. I'll take care of your family. Atiye, enough, please. Don't ruin your life with these ridiculous things. Sis, do you know how many women would want to be you? I don't want any problems on our most beautiful day, please. And who are you, Atiye? What do you want? Hello, welcome. What's up, young man? I'm fine. Excited. Right, I'm going in. Okay, go. How are you? I should go as well, huh? - It's time. - It's time. Let's go. Erhan? There is someone I'd like you to meet. Subtitle translation by Didem İpekoğlu
