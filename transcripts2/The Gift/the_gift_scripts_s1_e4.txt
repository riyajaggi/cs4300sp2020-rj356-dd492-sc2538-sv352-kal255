 GIVE ME TIME. I'M SORRY. Mom, Atiye left her phone behind. When I call the last number that called her, no one picks up. Mom? Mom, can you hear me? Mom. Mrs. Serap? I have a question. Do you know the owner of this car? There is a woman sitting in the back seat, an old woman. Do you know who she is? Mrs. Serap? Nejat... Mr. Serdar, I keep explaining, but it's not getting through.

 We need to call the police as soon as possible. I'm a cop! An ex-cop. I know how these things work. We won't handle things that way, Mr. Mustafa. We're talking about our daughter here. We'll call whoever we need to. Mr. Serdar... Mrs. Serap, you appreciate that this is a family matter, so we'll handle it ourselves. The police could leak this to the press. We wouldn't want that. I don't care, let them leak it to whomever they want! Let the whole country find out! I want my daughter. Trust me. I have my own ways. I will bring your daughter back to you myself. Mr. Serdar knows best, Mustafa. Mustafa. Mustafa, please trust him. I just want my daughter. I want my daughter. Okay, okay. - I'm going to go mad, where is she? - It's okay, dear, we will find her. Where are we going, Erhan? The goddesses have been waiting for us for a very long time. Our destination is Nemrut. Mr. Serdar! Mr. Serdar! Alright, let's all calm down. What did I tell you guys? Didn't I say it would be the wedding of the year? We haven't seen the bride since the wedding was canceled. - Why isn't she in front of the cameras? - To be honest, guys, I don't know either. Unfortunately, our bride ran away with some guy at the last minute. The truth of the matter is, the one and only bride, Atiye, got ill right before the wedding. But Atiye is inside, in the care of the best doctors. She will soon feel much better and we will go on with the wedding from where we left off. We've got the license plate. It belongs to an Erhan Kurtiz. Okay. I have an urgent matter to attend to, so that's it for today. See you. - Mr. Serdar! - Mr. Serdar! Going somewhere, son? I thought I would go out, Dad. Get some air, get my head together. You are a disgrace to our family, son. Your fiancée ran away with some guy and you couldn't do shit to stop her. You're pathetic, my son. When are you going to be a man? What are you thinking? That you'll become a man when you kill the guy your fiancée is with? You would only humiliate yourself more. ...Atiye is inside, in the care of the best doctors. She will soon feel much better and we will go on with the wedding... This is all they have in your size. You're screwed. Your wife is going to make your honeymoon hell now. She's not my wife. You're a runaway bride... Did you kidnap her from the wedding? I didn't. She came running to me. No way. That didn't happen, of course. She's right, it didn't. She didn't run, she galloped. I ran away from my wedding just for this guy. Atiye, Atiye... Do you think this is easy for me? "It's just 500 people, I'll just run away, no big deal"? Of course not. Someone had a very detailed plan to stop me finding my grandmother. To make me believe I was crazy. Do you realize how insane that is? I was a jackass. I'm sorry. That's it? - I am an oaf! And... - Hush! And? And I apologize, Atiye Özgürsoy. If you want, I'll shout it outside too. What? I'm surprised. Just when I think I have you figured out, you do something else. Is he there? Who is with him? Wait. Mr. Serdar. I hope we're not interrupting. Unfortunately, we haven't learned anything from the plates, Mrs. Serap. Okay... Is there nothing else? No other news? I understand... Okay. So, then, what should we do? Wait, right? Let's wait. Listen carefully. Follow Atiye and keep me posted about everything, okay? When we get to Nemrut... You know those big statues, the heads? Antiochus, king of Commagene, had them made for his tomb and shrine. Of course, just like every other king of his time, he wanted to be a god and be worshipped after his death. Such vanity. Only you men have such egos. But something is very interesting. That tomb still hasn't been found. There is a tomb, we know that, but the tunnels underground are so long and complex that no one was able to find where they even lead to. Grandmother. We talked about it before, but we have some questions. For example, that symbol we both drew. Once there was a woman named Isias in Nemrut. Also the girl I saw with the star-shaped mark on her forehead. She was the Princess of Cappadocia. So, you know her? Isias? The girl with the star mark. She had five children. Three girls. She's talking about Antiochus's wife, but history books rarely mention her. If only you could have seen her. She would radiate light, perform miracles. Find her. When you do, she will shine again. She will shine like a star! Aunt Zühre, my father found something very important in Göbekli Tepe years ago and... he told you about it. Do you remember what he said? You will both get your answers at the king and queen's tombs. I'll wait for you in the car. Come when you're done. Don't be like this. She is old. It could take some time for her to remember. Or she doesn't remember anything and we are on a dead-end journey. Serap. I have an idea. I can help find Atiye. Watch the surveillance tapes from work, even track the car. Mustafa... I know it's illegal. I mean, if I get caught, there'd be a penalty, but... Serap, isn't it worth it for our daughter? Are you going to do what Mr. Serdar failed to do, Mustafa? For God's sake! Don't be an idiot. - I'm so sorry! - Ozan, what are you doing? So sorry. Oh, fuck! There's a bell by the door, remember? Old habits. What are you doing, Ozan? Coming into the house like that? You've gotten used to using the keys. I've been looking for her all morning. Went to her friends', her favorite places. Gone. It's like Atiye just vanished into thin air. So, I came here thinking she might... Cansu, did I do something? Is all of this my fault? Ozan! Stop, what are you doing? Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, sorry. - Come here. - I'm sorry. There is nothing to be sorry for. You did nothing wrong. Cansu... This will all pass. I'm sorry. Aunt Zühre. Your name was written in my dad's notebook. In fact, some pages were missing. Now, when I think about it, since you're here, maybe we don't need to find the missing pages? The embossment of the girl with the star mark... Did my dad find that before me? It wasn't the right time. What does that mean? Why? He was green. Just like your questions. I've done some research. My dad... mentioned a possible connection between Sirius and Göbekli Tepe. Obviously, he discovered something major. We're close, slow down. Why? Pull over after the woods when the road sweeps around. Stop. Stop, stop! I said stop. Stop. That's it. Stop. Wait. Where are you going? Stop, where are you going? Be careful, slowly. Can you hear the Earth's voice? The Earth has its own memory, a specific language. If you speak that language it has so much to tell you. Slowly. Slowly. Where are we going? Wait. Elif! Don't be afraid. Nazım! I'm stuck! Elif! Elif! Mom? Elif! Come... Elif! Nazım! They're coming! Nazım! What did you do to me? What was that? Don't blame yourself. Don't feel guilty about them. I... I was at my aunt's. Seven years old. I cried all day, asking for them to pick me up. All this time... I thought it was because of me. But... Follow your father's path. You will understand everything when we get to Nemrut. Where were you? Are you okay? Atiye. Come, Grandma. Erhan? Let's get to Nemrut and figure out all these damn mysteries. Come on. I'm going to get some food for tonight. I'll catch up. ADIYAMAN BAZAAR - Hello? - Hello, dear. Sis! Shit... Thank God nothing's happened to you! Are you okay? I'm fine, don't worry. You actually ran away from the wedding. A runaway bride. Who would do something like that? - Yeah, but I had my reasons... - Sis! I'm telling you, people are losing it. Mom will have a breakdown any second. And Dad... My dear Dad, what he became overnight... You literally ran away from the wedding of the year. Cansu. Oh, fine, sorry. I did it again. Where are you? Where? My symbol was found in Göbekli Tepe for a reason. I'm sure of it. I'm going to figure it out. Oh, stop talking nonsense! I will say it clearly: I couldn't go through with marrying Ozan. I still haven't figured out who I am. So I can't dedicate myself to being us. Do you understand? - Perfectly, in fact. - But... I will come back once I find what I'm looking for. Promise. Don't keep that promise, and I will tell Mom that you lost her pearl necklace in tenth grade. Idiot. One more thing. Don't tell anyone what I just told you. Sis, no. I'm serious. No one. Promise me! Fine! I'm hanging up. - I love you. - That woman is back! God bless you. Welcome back! You told me they took her to the mountain. Thanks be to God. Welcome back! Thank you. I was reunited with my baby thanks to you. May God bless you. I was looking for you, Zühre. Everyone's thanking her. Thanking her? They worship her. Atiye. Come on, Grandma. Excuse me. Let's go. We need to be on top of the mountain before sunset. Thanks. Is that the snake figure of Göbekli Tepe? Actually, it might not be. The funny thing is, no evidence of snakes living in Göbekli Tepe has been found. No fossils, no remnants... So, what is it? Maybe they saw something in the sky. I don't know, maybe a comet? Good morning, your grace. Good morning. If it's no trouble, maybe you could get up and eat what I've prepared. I have a question. But it's a bit personal. When I was sleeping in the car, what happened in the woods with my grandma? Sorry... I didn't meant to pry. My father, mother and sister... died in a car crash in those woods. But the things Zühre showed me were entirely different. I was seven years old. My dad was working at Göbekli Tepe. You were so young. Who took care of you? Uncles, aunts... I wandered from one place to the next. That must have been awful. You get used to it. But I got the chance to travel all over the country. Different people, different cultures... It was a lot of experience. So, that's where your nomadism comes from. That you don't want roots, someone different in every port... Now is the time you decide to go quiet? No. It's... It's not that. I... I normally never talk about all this. To anyone... Ever. But? There's something about you. When you're opposite me, I want to share everything with you. I should gather some firewood. Cansu? Did Atiye call when I was sleeping? No. Cansu... What? I said no. Cansu, don't lie to me. Look... I am... I can't... Okay, that's it, I'm done. What does that mean? It means, Ozan, that I am done being your guide to Atiye. It means that I quit giving you reports, telling you what Atiye likes, and doesn't like. Do you get it? I am done with struggling for your relationship. Cansu? Remember the night before graduation at university? You and Atiye were going out to celebrate. I, the dumbass, tagged along. Atiye left a bit early. Then for a little while, it was just you and me. - Yes. - What did you say to me, Ozan? What did you say? "Cansu. I think Atiye wants to break up with me and I don't know what to do. Please help me!" You said that, right? What did I do? I helped! Stupid! I helped you! That's when all this talk started. "Do I need to know something about Atiye? I should call Cansu." "Is there a problem with my relationship? I'll go to Cansu, she's a good confidant. I should go confide in her." Does any of this sound familiar? Can't you see what we've become? Don't you see? Atiye is on her own path, chasing full speed after what she wants. What about me? What happens to me? I'm something to everyone, right? The daughter, the best friend... I'm someone's something, right? But Ozan, once, just once, me! What about me? Grandma? Grandma? What the hell? Who are you? Why are you following us? Grandma! Grandma! Atiye... Grandma! Atiye... What is it, Mustafa? Have you gone mad? Who is she? Huh? Who is that woman? Do you recognize her? This was taken on the street of that house we went to with Atiye. In May. Recognize it? And this? This is from last month. At the same place. Recognize it? And the owner? There's a picture of you together! That kind man who greeted us. Do you recognize this? The woman Atiye insisted she saw! The woman she was calling grandmother! The same woman you said died years ago! Do you remember? My mother... is not dead. The woman in the car when they ran away from Atiye's wedding, was that your mother, too? That's her as well. That's why you didn't want me to watch the security tapes. You were scared I would uncover it all! But you! You did what you always do, didn't you? When we went back to the house, she wasn't there. - Because you... - Because I... I did it. I went to that house and made it look like that damned woman never lived there! Got it? I did it! Why, Serap? Get the fuck out! My mother is a very dangerous woman. My father died because of her. All that woman does is harm people. Atiye! Come! She will harm our daughter, too. - Atiye. - Grandma, are you alright? Welcome, Atiye. What are you doing? I'm feeling. The sun is rising. Atiye, eternity... does not mean having endless time. It means timelessness. "If you want to experience infinite enlightenment, you need to get the past, the future out of your mind. And stay in the present." A wise man once said. Shams-i Tabrizi. It's beautiful. And what are you doing? I'm not doing anything. But you are... You're starting your own journey. My journey? Where to? You will decide where yourself. I don't understand what you're saying. Even so, you still have to do it, my child. That is your duty. The duty you owe to your blood. Grandma. Don't be afraid. It's time. Time for what? There is eternity in your destiny. Grandma. Grandma. Erhan! Hey, wait for me! Where did she go? Wait for me. Subtitle translation by Didem İpekoğlu
