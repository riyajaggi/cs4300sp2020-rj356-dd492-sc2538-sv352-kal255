 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Who would have been hurt by Atiye? THE GIFT - Got you! - Fuck! Did I scare you? I'll scare the hell out of you! They're for tonight. Roses are a bit cliché, but you'll manage. You're a bit cliché, too, but I manage. Are you still working, my love? I see a lot of effort here.

 Nah, that's just to relax my mind a bit. Have you got a headache? Was it a nightmare, or...? Nothing like that. You think it's okay to be a teacher, right? Darling, you are not an average teacher. You broaden their horizons. You're right. In that case... it's okay if I cancel the exhibition. Are you crazy? Maybe. Sometimes people say I'm crazy. All your paintings will sell. Wait and see. And if they don't sell, I'll buy them!

 - No, Ozan. - What? Don't you dare. You promised not to buy anything. Alright then. Let's miss out on the chance to buy the works of the greatest painter in the history of painting. They smell beautiful. Actually, I was going to throw rose petals on your bed. Is that so? Since you wouldn't be home. Why wouldn't I be home? - You were meeting your sister. - Ah! I forgot her! I can't believe you forgot something. I have to go. - I have to go! - I'm not doing anything. I really need to go and take care of the dress! - I am not doing anything. - I need to take care of the dress! Go then. Go. Well, since I'm already late... Yes. I'm going to shorten the skirt a bit. Let me check. The neck looks fine to me. I'll leave it like this. Well done! It's so beautiful. Thank you! I look just like a little girl in her mom's dress! A little girl, playing games. Sis, you look marvelous! I like it! What's that? Encore. Can I ask what Encore is? Sure. It's a new dating app. It matches you via songs, and every match becomes an "Encore." - No way. You must be joking. - Why? So just because you love the same song, you're soul mates? Why not? Why do all couples have a song that's "our song"? Ozan and I don't. Ozan's favorite is a love song, "Ours is a Love Story." And he only sings it at Besiktas matches. What can we do, dear? Not all of us find Prince Charming at university like you. Don't worry, you'll find him. Of course I will. I'll find him this weekend. Cansu, I don't think anyone has ever found the love of their life on the beach. Is that so? Why not? I find one every week. A woman over there has been looking in here for five minutes. Great! She's welcome to come in. She might buy all my clothes. She's a strange woman. I've literally got goose bumps. Where is she? She was there. Never mind. Come here, or your dress won't be ready on time. Okay, sorry. Call the professor. Call the professor! So, it's true that Göbekli Tepe was built 7000 years before the pyramids of Giza and 6000 years before Stonehenge? According to the radiocarbon data, that's true. Some people claim that it's the world's first temple, or the Lost City of Atlantis. As you know, excavations began here in 1994. Soon after, my father joined the team. The area we've uncovered so far is perhaps less than 10% of the whole site. Therefore, it's too early to give any other theories than the ones we mentioned earlier. Is it the mystery that made you follow in your father's footsteps? No. Well, of course my father's enthusiasm impressed me as a kid. But my aim here is to examine and analyze archaeological artefacts. Not to solve any mysteries. So you're not looking for the Holy Grail, and you're not a treasure hunter, right? No. If you're talking about Indiana Jones, that's not me. An archaeologist could work for their whole life and die before making a single discovery. The aim of archaeology, the aim of "real" archaeology, is actually... to try to understand the future. By coming upon past findings, we interpret the present. Professor! - Professor Erhan! They've found something! - What is it? I don't know. Excuse me. There are a lot of artists who inspire me. Pollock, of course. Franz Kline. Helen Frankenthaler. How would you describe yourself as an artist? Actually, how I describe myself is not very important. I think my paintings speak for themselves. Or I hope they do, at least. She is the best, most magnificent painter you will ever see. And the bestest sister ever. - Have you met my sister Cansu? - Hi. - Hi. - She is a designer. Hi, Cansu. - Cheers! - Cheers, baby. Atiye really is a very original artist. It's an honor for us to host her first solo exhibition. I suppose you must be as proud of your daughter as we are. Of course we are proud of her. Right, my dear? Of course. I think it's very original, which is exactly why you should buy it. I think this one matches your blue eyes, Ms. Hande. Thank you. Wow. Excuse me. Dad. Here's the second excavation area. Mr. Serdar! Atiye! Ozan said you were in Tokyo. Nothing is more important than this, my dear! We are here to congratulate you. Look over there... What a crowd! - It's the free drinks... - Lots of pieces have been sold! Which one are we going to buy? Dad, do you think Atiye cares about making money? She's probably already donated the profits. Mr. Mustafa? There are more important things than money. Yes. Like making more money. That woman again. What woman? Can you hold this? Madam? Darling? That woman was right here, then disappeared. It's a bit cold out. Let's go inside. Professor? - Where is it? - Here. Light? That looks like a lid, don't you think? It might be. There's also a possibility that it's only a marker. Is it any different than what you've already found? I don't think anyone has ever found something like this. The figure in the middle... That's very different. - Do you have any idea what it stands for? - No, I don't. But calling this merely "different" wouldn't be fair. Can you zoom in? Okay, can you please leave? - Thanks, Professor. - Have a good day. Professor, do you think there's a passage? I don't know. Thank you for coming. - Good night. - Let's get ready to go. It is a great honor to have you here tonight, Mr. Serdar! The honor is ours, Ms. Serap. I talked to the gallery owner just now. All of Atiye's works were sold! Boom! Fantastic! I think people loved the colors and sizes. I mean, I'm not sure if they understood exactly what I meant by them. Though I don't know if I understand myself. Does it matter? It sold out. Congratulations are in order. Can you paint the picture of happiness, Abidin? Here. It has been painted already! I'm sure you remember my younger daughter, Mr. Serdar. Cansu. Of course! - Hello, Cansu! - Hi! You think his wealth might pass on to me from shaking hands? Cansu, let's go, darling. So sorry. Not their fault. It's because I'm adopted. Cansu... Before you leave, I'd like to invite you to dinner next week. - Of course. - We'd love to. - When and where exactly? - Cansu, please, stop. Let's go, my dear! - Thanks again. - Thank you, too. - Thank you. - Thank you. You are simply amazing, my dear. Thank you! Good night. Come here. Do you realize how lucky you are, son? Don't mess this up. Everything was perfect, sweetie. It was a great night. I met the principal of your school. Mr. Mert. They want you to get tenure at the school. You'd love that too, wouldn't you? I'd love my daughter to have a proper job, of course. It doesn't matter if you paint with kids or on your own, does it? "We won't tell you to stop painting. But do it as a hobby..." You wanted an exhibition and you got one! Did we stop you? The case is closed because of the exhibition? I can have a proper job, now? Sweetie. I want you to have a stable job. Is stability a bad thing? No, it's not... For you! Do you think that Ozan wants to marry a painter with an unconventional lifestyle? Ask the woman he's going to marry. That's enough! Enough! What's going on? Did you see something? Never mind, you sleep. What is it? Atiye saw something at the exhibition. Cansu! She is just drunk. No way. IMPORTANT DISCOVERY AT GÖBEKLİ TEPE What are you doing? Check this out. - Just tell me what it is. - Cansu! Okay. Did someone steal your drawing? They found it at Göbekli Tepe. - So you stole it. - Be serious for a second. It was underground for thousands of years, yet I've been drawing it since I was a kid. Strange. Strange? That's all? What else can I say? I don't get it. Okay, so don't get it. Just water the plants. - Wait a minute. Where are you going? - To Göbekli Tepe. Right now? Don't be silly. What for? I don't know. To see it. So you saw the picture. But what are you going to do there? See you tomorrow. Can you listen to me for a minute? Atiye! Wait a minute. I get it! We are different. I'm a joyful businesswoman, and you're a cool painter. Oh, you really find me cool? Yes, I do. But sis, don't do this. What are you going to do there? I had a nightmare again last night and was frightened, as always. But do you know what happened after I saw this? I don't know why, but nothing has calmed me this much in my entire life. Something happened to me. I have to go there. I have to see it. Celal, let's go. Only children are afraid of the dark, right? Sometimes children know what we have forgotten. Well, that's a cool saying. Come on, let's go. Oh, my God. Hello? Atiye. Ozan? After 200 meters, keep right. What? There is no right turn here! Darling? - Remember the symbol I draw? - Hello? The symbol. The symbol. Can you hear me, Ozan? - Sweetie? - Ozan? Come on... Are you okay? Are you okay? Does that mean "yes"? Do you know where this road goes? Do you speak Turkish? I'm trying to get to Göbekli Tepe. What are you doing? Göbekli Tepe! Seat belt first. Göbekli Tepe. Dolomite and limestone. Surprised? No, not about this place. Now at least we know why the seismic scanning didn't show this passage. Dolomite has a conchoidal surface which doesn't allow accurate scanning. It's slippery. That's not natural. This place has been polished. Dear God! So the people who lived here thousands of years ago made this, right? But how did they do it, Professor? I thought you would tell me, Celal. Because I've never seen such a thing before. I don't think anyone else has either. I am driving straight on. Celal! - Do you hear that? - What? It's like... someone singing a song. I can't hear it. Maybe one of the crew? No. I think it's coming from below. Come on, Celal, don't be ridiculous! Professor! Celal, please. Professor, I swear! No, I don't hear a thing. Can we come back later, please? Alright then, off you go. But I don't want to see you again! You sound just like your father. If it was my father, you would do as he said. Move, Celal. Move. A dead end. That shouldn't be here. Professor, stop. What are you doing? It's beeswax. Beeswax? How did beeswax end up in here? This place has been sealed. So you won't be able to reach the treasure or the mummies, Professor? That's right! We'll start on this first thing tomorrow. There must be something behind it. How strange. I've never been here before. But I feel like I know this place. Excuse me? I don't understand. Wait. Where are you going? Thanks. Really. Atiye said she saw a ruin or something on the news and is going there. Her phone is disconnected and I can't reach her. "Hi, Cansu! How are you?" "You look beautiful today." "Is that a new dress?" I'm glad you asked, my dear! I made this dress. No time for jokes, Cansu. Okay. Would you like something to drink? Coffee? Where is your sister? You just told me. At the ruins. And you believe that story? What story? Do you think I'm stupid? Nobody thinks that. I mean... not in this case. Alright. Sorry, I take it back. Did she meet anyone at the exhibition last night? Ozan, come on... Okay, I got it. Atiye does whatever she wants. You know that, too. But she loves you. She always has. You probably know that after six years, right? I'm just... What she's doing is so weird, even for her. Yes, darling. Because you have a strange girlfriend. You wanted to see me. You must be Mr. Erhan. Call me Erhan. Atiye. I want to show you something. Ever since I can remember, I've drawn this symbol. Interesting. Interesting? What else can I say? I mean, how would you explain something like this? Assuming you didn't draw all this today. Why would I do that? Assuming you didn't draw them today, we can call it collective consciousness. Collective consciousness? Or convergent evolution. As an art school graduate, Introduction to Recycling was my one science lesson. So, can you explain a bit more? Convergent evolution is when two different and unrelated species evolve through the same changes. So, a coincidence? For example, ichthyosaurs of the Mesozoic Era and dolphins are almost identical. That is not a coincidence. Not sure, but I think the same thing might happen with succulent plants. Oh, I see. I'm not being taken seriously. Erhan, look... I have no idea about dolphins or succulent plants. All I know is that for some reason I should be here. How can I explain... I feel like I have a connection with this place. I know it sounds ridiculous! I also can't believe what I'm saying. But I'm not crazy. It's just, this feeling is so powerful. I've never felt it before. And I have to see that symbol. Please. Okay, you can see it. But after the excavation. I can't wait that long. Can I see it for five minutes? Just five minutes. I guess I didn't explain very well. This is a new excavation area and we can't allow visitors until it's open to the public. It's nothing personal. If it's okay with you, I need to go. Have a nice day. Thanks, Erhan. You were very helpful... Hello? Can you hear me, honey? I can hear you, my dear. Finally. We couldn't talk all day. The reception isn't very good here. Last time I used a landline I was a child. Where are you? My symbol turned up in Göbekli Tepe. I came to see it. Isn't that incredible? My love, you didn't say where you were. Please don't start. I couldn't reach you. - Do you realize what I went through? - I'll get the first flight tomorrow. We'll talk tomorrow. Okay. Tell me about it tomorrow. Are you okay? I have checked into a hotel. I'm good. Everything is good. Okay? I miss you so much. I miss you, too. You're not going anywhere tomorrow. I'm booking you. Okay then. I will cook for you tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it already! Okay. - See you tomorrow. - See you. Who's there? Is that blood? Wait! I can't come with you. Okay. Okay. I'm coming. It would help if I knew what we're looking for. Okay, okay. Wait for me. Hey! Where are you? Outside of Urfa Is full of mountains I feel very sorry, mommy And my eyes are crying They found this. Down there, in a rental car. Where are we going? Wait for me! Wait for me! Who's down there? Atiye? - The girl is in there! - I'm trying to be a gentleman. Brilliant effort! Atiye Özgürsoy, and you are a teacher? Part-time! I told you I'm a painter! Get your hands off me! Whatever. Tell it to the police. Come on! The girl is in there by the purple rocks. Are you deaf? What girl? What rocks? She brought me here. She has a star on her forehead. Sister, you really are crazy. Alright, Celal. Let's go. Take your bag. Look, I don't know what or who you saw but this is an excavation area. If I ever see you here again, I'll have to call the police. Got it? Professor, you're being too easy on her. I can see it in her eyes, she'll give us trouble. No, Celal. She is confused and scared. She needs a doctor, not the police. I've seen people like her before. Smells great! What did you cook? Come on... Please, don't. Especially not today. I'm going to order take-out, okay? Do you want a drink? Atiye. Stop for a second. What is it? - When I couldn't call... - I said, my phone was dead. Let me finish. I guess yesterday was the longest we've ever spent without talking to each other. It gave me time... to think about you, us. It's not easy for me to say this. Are you breaking up with me? Not exactly. What's going on? Do you know what I realized? I didn't get angry or jealous, I just... thought about a life without you. I don't even want to think of anything like that again. Will you marry me, Atiye? You are serious. Say yes. Yes. - Is that something you planned? - No. Let's leave it. You forgot this. Thank you. I didn't come just for that. We found the girl you were talking about. I'm glad. Is she okay? We started to open that passage after you left. When we removed the blockage, we found a tunnel. It led to the place you mentioned. There really is a cave! There are purple stones! I told you so. Ozan, this is Erhan, the archaeologist... Kurtiz. Atiye, it was impossible for you to know about that cave! It was sealed for hundreds, even thousands of years. How is the girl? You haven't said. That girl... That girl... There's a relief on the cave wall. In the middle of that relief, there's a figure of a girl with a star on her forehead. Atiye, you... Who are you? Subtitle translation by Didem İpekoğlu
