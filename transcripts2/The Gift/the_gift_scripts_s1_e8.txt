 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Atiye... God, protect me. Pick up, Öner. Pick up. Hello, Öner. It's Nazım. Forget the time and listen to me. Gather the committee tomorrow, you need to be here. Not on the phone! You need to see it with your own eyes. Yes. We will get funding from the entire world, you hear me? Funding will flood in from all directions. I've already...

 Hello? You need to hide that place, Nazım. It's not yet time. Who are you? How did you get in? How do you know my... Wait a minute, wait a minute, how do you know what I've found? Finding this door is your son's destiny. Opening it is Atiye's duty. What are you blabbering on about, woman? Erhan is only seven. Who is Atiye? They will find each other when the time is right.

 Do what I tell you Nazım. Your time is short. The trial of Atiye Özgürsoy, arrested for the alleged murder of her sister, has begun. The daughter-in-law of the famous businessman Serdar Yılmaz has been taken into custody. Meanwhile, Ozan Yılmaz has denied allegations of an affair with the murder victim, Cansu Özgürsoy. Atiye Özgürsoy, reported to be mentally unstable by people close to her, has been sent to hospital for a criminal liability assessment. Until the resulting report is finished, the trial of murder suspect Atiye Özgürsoy will be postponed. In 2020, the East Anatolia Observatory, which will house the biggest telescope in Turkey... The time has come. Atiye must be at the solstice door. We have the girl. But I can't find the location of the door in such a short time. Everything will be lost if Atiye is not there at the right time. You have 48 hours. Understood. I will find it, don't worry. It's my time, not yours! Hannah, what are you doing here? Now's not the time. I came to help you, Schatze. It's a terrible thing. I mean, I don't know who to feel sorry for. Such a shame, but for Atiye or the dead girl? How can you help me? Do you know something? What's that? What you handed over. Why do you have this? They sent it back to you as a gesture of goodwill. They have a proposition to save Atiye... It was you! You were the one at Nemrut too. What's going on? Who do you work for? Look. This position is nice, why didn't we try it? I'll kill you. I don't think so, because you have more important things to do. They want the missing pages. You will bring them in 24 hours. I don't have the pages. Who are they? You have 24 hours if you want to save your beloved Atiye. Get a move on. Or you'll have to bury Atiye too. Come on, don't lie around. Help me. Do something. Come on, help me. Just help! Nothing you do not want to happen will happen, Atiye. Whatever happened, happened because you wanted it to. Did I want Cansu to die? I didn't. Are you sure? She's not my sister. She's adopted. What kind of talk is that? I'm very upset now. - I don't want her. She should die. - What? Fuck... No, Cansu. Now you know how strong you are. Help me, please. Make everything the way it was. Or make it a nightmare I can wake from. It is in your hands. How is it in my hands? Cansu's dead, it's over. Nothing is ever over in the universe, Atiye. it just transforms. Cansu did not go anywhere. What does that mean? Go where everything is born. You will find her there. Am I dying too? No. Cansu is dead. Dead. It's not possible. Yes, it is possible. Because your consent is possible, Atiye. When the wounds of your soul begin to heal... Don't go. ...you will find your way. I beg you, don't go. Please don't go. At least tell me where everything is born. You can do it. You did it before. Wow! That girl worked with me for five years. Yes, sir, that girl fooled both of us. She works for the guys who stole this notebook. In fact, they were the ones who were after my father. I'm telling you, this whole situation is fucked. They're after the missing pages and I think they are in here. We have 24 hours to solve it. They threatened Atiye's life. I think the code is in these numbers, but I don't know how, or in which order. Is it... coordinates of a star chart, I wonder? I thought of verses of the Quran, but couldn't get a result. Look Erhan, whatever your father found, it was something much more valuable than we originally thought. I'm going to work on this. See here. Do you see this graph? You see this number? Look. They are the same. No, Dad... I can't do that to Atiye. I'm gonna go, and confess everything. Ozan! Dad, I killed her. - I killed her. - Son, pull yourself together! I am myself, Dad. This was all because of you. What are you saying? I asked you for an ambulance, what did you do? Do I have to tell you again? She was dead when I got there. She was not, Dad! She was looking right at me. How can someone die by hitting their head on a wall? I could have saved her. She died after you left! Understand? You hear? Hey! I'm talking to you. It was too late. Now, you look forward. As if this never happened. No. I... I will serve my sentence, confess everything. Fine... Fuck off then! Go confess! Spend your life in prison! What's gonna happen? Will it bring the girl back? What about Atiye? You should've thought of that before fucking it all up. I gave my life for this. Do you know what I've done to get here? Was it all for you to rot in jail, for our reputation to be ruined? I can't stop seeing it, Dad. I can't stop seeing Cansu's face. Only the strong survive in the wild. Cansu was weak. But you, you're not like that. You're strong. Because you are my son. You will forget. Years from now, you'll thank me for this. Come on. Go. Stay out of sight for a while. Everything will be fine. I promise you, son. What is it, Mustafa? Where are you going? Whatever you hid from me, from our daughter, from us, is what ruined us, Serap. I don't want to see you anymore. Mustafa, I'm very sorry. I really am very sorry. I just wanted... Wanted to protect her, didn't you? Protect! Now we've lost them both. Is that protection, huh? - Is that protection? - Mustafa, look, listen to me. I thought just for a moment that Atiye did it, that the illness took hold of her, but I was wrong. - Okay, get out of my way. - I was wrong. - Mustafa, I'm really... - Take this! Take it. Move. Mustafa. Mustafa, why won't you listen? I'm telling you, I'm really sorry. Please! Mustafa. Mustafa! We're not getting anywhere. The map, the coordinates, the letters, the alphabet... There's no consistency. Your father must have left a clue to solve it, if he left these numbers for us. Yes, I know, but we don't have time. They said "We'll kill her." I mean, I can't endanger Atiye. You've become very attached to this woman, son. But this is now far beyond your father's business and Göbekli Tepe. Are you going to hand the secret that cost your father his life to these filthy men with your own hands? Professor, I can't lose Atiye. I have to get her out of there and if that means giving those bastards the secret, I will. But she will get out. I need to check with Mustafa. He may know something. You have five minutes. My dear Atiye. I am so sorry. I am very sorry. I know yours was taken so I brought you mine. C. ÖZGÜRSOY BORN: 22.9.1994- DIED: 16.6.2019 I thought I might find you here. I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks. My condolences to you as well. There is something I wanted to ask. What do you want? That night, the night of the accident, I want to know exactly what happened. Why? What will you knowing anything change? I'm looking for something belonging to my dad. It may help me save Atiye. Was there anything with my sister, or I don't know, in the car, anything, a notebook, a note... What do you really want, young man? Twenty-three years have passed! What is left after 23 years? I'll tell you what is left: A family in pieces. A son who had to live without knowing who the murderers were. And Elif, who died without getting to know her brother. Because you hid away my sister. And this murder was covered up. I had to, son. They threatened me. Atiye was so small. If I had left that baby there, they would have killed her too. I still couldn't stop it. Who threatened you? I don't know, I don't know! All I know is... Atiye didn't kill Cansu. I will prove that son of a bitch Ozan did this. I'll prove it. I won't leave Atiye in there. I won't leave Atiye in there. Reality... always stands in front of us no matter how much we ignore or disregard it. That's what my mother said, and she was right. People believed... that my mother was a healer. She knew improbable things, healed the unhealable. But it was different in the village. They believed she was a sorceress, a demon. One day... they attacked our house. Burn the house down! Where are you, Seher? Where are you, Seher? Let go of me! Where are you? Serap! I cannot see! Serap! Serap, where are you? Where are you? I cannot see. Serap, where are you? I cannot see! No! Don't do it! Serap! Where are you, Seher? You had a sister? She was 12 years old. Her name was Seher. There was... a star-shaped birthmark on her face. On her forehead? Yes, her forehead. Here. After that day, the talent my mother called "God-given" became nothing but a disease for me. That's what I believed, and I didn't want to believe anything else. And then you were born, and I saw the same mark on you. The star shape we all have, my mother, me, Seher. I got so scared. So scared, Atiye. I was even scared to love you. I was afraid of you having the same fate. I shut my mother away to keep her away from you. I didn't want you to be harmed. But, my mother... was right. She said you were very special. Atiye, I'm scared. We lost Cansu, I can't lose you too. I can never lose you. Maybe we didn't lose Cansu. You did the best you could. I am your daughter. And thank you for everything you did or couldn't do for me. Time is up. She said... you have a duty, a legacy. A duty our grandmothers passed down to us. She said the world is pregnant with something big and the birth will be here, in Anadolu. And that door... can only be opened with your will. Last call! Okay. Time is up! Please, get out. I love you so much, Atiye. Forgive me, my sister. For not being able to be a brother to you, for not protecting you, forgive me. I wish I'd had the chance to know you sooner. C. ÖZGÜRSOY BORN: 22.9.1994- DIED: 16.6.2019 Sixteen. Sixteen. Six. Nineteen. Sixteen. Six. Nineteen. How could this be? Sixteen. Six. Nineteen. Mom! My son, Erhan. When you find these pages, Elif will have died. Maybe time isn't as linear as we were told, son. Maybe the past and the future have dissolved within one another, and we are in a dream, a delusion. I am giving you the key to a knowledge, an archaic guidance, that has been hidden for millennia. Protect yourself from the ones seeking it. I misdirected them years ago. They thought they found the location of the door in the notebook they stole from me, whereas I hid this map for you to find when the time was right. Find the door. Atiye's freedom depends on it. Atiye... means the future, son. She is the light buried in the darkness. Protect her. Who is it? It's me. Atiye! How did you get out? Are you okay? We need to go to Göbekli Tepe. There is a door there, I can bring Cansu back. The cameras were broken. No one knows how she escaped through that window. Find them. Both of them. I already have. You know where they're going. POLICE We've found the suspect's vehicle. 63, the stallholder is with me. It's empty. HQ, here are its plates: 34 VE 0017. I wonder how your dad knew the date Cansu would die. He wrote that we would meet as well. Maybe that door opens to the past? That's why she spoke of bringing Cansu back. I don't know. I mean... When I think of all that's happened since I met you I don't even know what I know anymore. I know nothing. One thing I do know: I will always be by your side. I was bound to meet you, Erhan. And I had to love you. Can you recover erased data? Let's have a look. Hannah. They'll stop 20 kilometers from the city. Be on alert. Get the girl in the car safely. Take the pages too. If needed, get rid of Erhan. I'll see you there. Copy that! Do not lose Atiye, you hear me? You have no other future but her. What? What is all this? Dad. I couldn't survive if something happened to Atiye. Hang on! I couldn't survive either, son. How? No, no! No. Why? Why? Why? No. Dad! Dad! Stop! Don't! Get over there! Don't. I'll confess. I did it. It was an accident, but I did it, okay? What will you confess? What will you confess? You didn't kill her. Here, look at this. Mr. Serdar... My sweet... Help me... Don't worry... Get up. Erhan, don't get out! Erhan! Hello, Schatze. - Hannah! - I'll take those pages, please. Okay, Hannah. Calm down, put down the gun. I don't have time. The pages are here. Let her go. Atiye, get out of the car. Don't move! Give me those pages so we won't need any nasty business. Okay, I will. That's it. Thank you very much. - Erhan! - Come here. - Erhan! - Atiye, run! You go! Run! Now tell me who you work for. Who? I have the papers. I'm going after Atiye. Very good, Hannah. Good job. Serdar Yılmaz! You are under arrest for the murder of Cansu Özgürsoy. - You're joking. - Take him in, guys. Yes. Ozan? What are you doing here? We're at the end of the road, Dad. Atik. Cansu. I'm fine, don't worry. Everything is as it should be. We all are part of the divine plan. We are all a continuation of one another. You couldn't have stopped what happened. But creating what will happen is in your hands. A gift was given to you, Atiye. You really can do whatever you want. That's it. I want you to come back. Are you sure, Atiye? Cansu! Cansu! I'm sorry. You have mistaken me for someone else. I'm Elif. Elif? I'm sorry, but I have a lot to do. Have a good day. Subtitle translation by Didem İpekoğlu
