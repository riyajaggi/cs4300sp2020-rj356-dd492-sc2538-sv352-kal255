 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES We've lived to see the day, haven't we? I wish Melek could have seen it too. Ozan's mother. She would have been so happy. May God rest her soul. May all the souls we've lost rest in peace. Amen. You don't have any other relatives, right? Your own parents? No, Mr. Serdar. Mustafa and I lost our families years ago. The girls never knew them.

 So be it. Now our kids are about to start their own family. It's good to stick with traditions when starting a family. Don't you agree? Yes, of course. Can you hear that too? - What? - No more "being your own person." Right, kids? Marriage is a serious institution. It most certainly is, of course. But Ozan and Atiye are smart kids who are aware of that. I mean, isn't that what's important, them knowing what they want? Exactly. We are sure of what we want.

 Of course. Then what do we say? With the command of God and the word of the Prophet, we ask for your beautiful daughter Atiye's hand in marriage to my one and only son, my precious Ozan. Now that the kids have agreed amongst themselves, it's time for us to speak. We would be proud to give our daughter as a bride to a family such as yours. Isn't that right, Serap? We would be honored. May they always have a bright future sharing the same pillow. Then let us honor the first step of the bond that will unite you together forever. Come on, then. I guess we put it on a finger. That's right. The scissors don't cut, though. Good joke. In the name of God. Okay, then. Alright. - Bravo! - May you have good fortune. Atiye! Honey? What happened? My dear? Sweetie! What happened? I saw a bird. A bird? A bird, but a different kind. An endangered species. Like me. Anyway, where were we? May you have good fortune. Thank you. May you have good fortune. I hear you're famous, sir. On the TV and all. We thought you wouldn't come back. Don't get your hopes up. I'll see you finish school, wise-ass. You're late, Professor. - Mr. Öner didn't start without you. - I'm here. The dean, the rector, they're all here. I don't get all this ceremony stuff. Should I get you a jacket? Never mind. Don't worry. We won't keep you long, Mr. Freesoul. Did Atiye show up? Don't know. Who is she? Let's see if Ms. Cansu will finish the wedding dress in time. She has her head in the clouds. She'll handle it, don't worry. We should buy a gift for Ozan. I was thinking maybe a watch, but who knows how many he already has. Atiye? Dear? What's gotten into you? What was up with you back at the house? Screaming, running to the window? Then just walking away? - And what were you doing in Urfa? - Didn't I tell you, Mom? Do you think the things you said are normal? So what, a drawing, they found a rock. You're getting married. Pull yourself together, I beg you. I am. I am getting married. I'm going to have order, a husband, a home. Wasn't that what you always wanted? There is something up with you. I can tell. Something's going on. Let's hope for the best. Atiye, don't give any money to these kids. They get used to it and pester people. Thank you. ASSC. PROF. ERHAN KURTİZ The school is holding a conference about Göbekli Tepe. If you come, we can talk about the symbol with Mr. Öner, as well as anything else you want to discuss. It's at 4:00 p.m. I'm getting out, Mom. Where are you going? See you later. We have loads to do. Cansu is waiting. Atiye, where are you going? As we all know, Göbekli Tepe is where the oldest temple on Earth is located. This discovery was made by one of our university teachers, Associate Professor Dr. Erhan Kurtiz, who will help us to better understand this place. Mr. Erhan, come on up. I invite our dean, Adnan Yarkın, to present the plaque. Come on up, sir. Hello, everyone. Thank you professors, dean. What does Professor Öner always say? "Archaeology is not about making a discovery in an excavation, it's about the..." "...interpretation." Interpretation, yes. We found a piece of stone in Göbekli Tepe, and there is a symbol on this stone. And what this symbol means is more valuable than the stone itself. Are there any comments? The circles resemble the infinity symbol. Yes, we see that as well. But I'm asking about your own interpretation. An original interpretation. Mrs. Atiye? What does this symbol mean to you? Go on, we're listening. It's like it signifies a hidden knowledge far beyond everything we know. It's actually something very simple, yet out of our reach. Can you elaborate? We couldn't quite understand that. I don't know how else to explain it. It's as if you're having a dream and you're in it, but also out of it. Something like that. We'll take whatever you're taking. Yes, we thank Mrs. Atiye for her valuable opinions. Sir, you can take it from here. There are many theories explaining Göbekli Tepe. - ...the Garden of Eden is... - You're late. I came to learn about the symbol, but you asked me about it. We're going to talk to Mr. Öner. Okay. OZAN 4 MISSED CALLS But I don't have much time. Congratulations. What? Come in! - Professor. - Welcome, Erhan. Is the lady your friend? No, sir, I'm not his friend. Atiye. We were forced to meet when the lady got unauthorized access to the site. - Pure coincidence. - No such thing as coincidence, right? If you are here, there is a reason for it and so there will be a result. I don't know about the result yet, but let me sum up the reason. When I went to Göbekli Tepe, I gave a lift to someone who looked just like this. I saw her again that night, and she took me to the cave. And she spoke. What did she say? Something like "Tu ki ye." "Who are you?" I'm sorry? It's Kurdish, and it means "Who are you?" Has anyone else seen this picture? No, me and Celal, and the little lady Atiye. What do you think it means? And that symbol. Do you know the meaning of the symbol? Although Mr. Erhan doesn't believe me, I've drawn it since I was a child. It is obvious that there is a connection between this picture and the symbol. But I don't quite know what it means myself. I can research it and let you know. Oh, I'm so sorry. - Yes, Cansu? - Come to the boutique. - I can't come now. - Mom's feeling ill. - What happened? - I don't know. You have to come. Okay, I'm coming. Sir, if I leave my number, can we speak if something comes up? Sure. Sorry! Please, don't trouble yourself. I'll sort it out. I am so sorry. If we find anything, I'll call you, Atiye. - It was very nice to meet you. - You, too. - Good luck with the research. - Thanks. We'll talk later. I'll call you. Put some lotion on your hands, they're like sandpaper. - What happened? - Surprise! Mom really does look quite ill. Would you rather I actually was ill? Where were you? Wait a minute. Are you seeing this? Mr. Serdar got it from France. Who knows which famous designer it's by. It's very beautiful. But they troubled themselves for nothing. I will wear Cansu Özgürsoy's design. You must be kidding. That would be disrespectful. Serdar Yılmaz probably didn't want his daughter-in-law to wear my lousy gown. And he's not wrong. Don't talk nonsense. Your dress won't be lousy. I'll talk to Mr. Serdar. Fine. You can explain it yourself tonight. Okay, Mom. See you. Don't be late. Sis, are you serious? I swear, I won't be offended. Got anything to drink? Of course. Are you stressed about the wedding? No, it's nothing like that. Thanks. I saw that woman again. The old woman? Not just her. I gave a lift to a girl in Göbekli Tepe, she was strange as well. Otherworldly. - She took me to the purple stones... - Sis! Wait. Can we come back to the present? Hello, I'm Cansu, your sister. We're in Istanbul. Look. You're not listening, Cansu. I saw the girl in the street today. You had an incredibly successful exhibition a few days ago. Then your charismatic boyfriend proposed to you. Come back to us. You have a life. I don't understand what this worry is about. Am I talking out of my ass? That's completely different. Do you know how many women would want to be you? Snap out of it. This old woman, Göbek Tepe, Göbekli Tepe, whatever, let it go. Go on, put this on. I swear, if you won't, I will. If you arrive in our hometown If you arrive in our hometown My red crane... I pressed for the carbon test, but it would be good if you could too. Imagine if it turns out to be 20,000 years old. The world would shake to its core. You could have taken a breath. I should have. I should have breathed easily all my life. What's wrong? What is it? Hannah, go on out and take a cigarette break, will you? Please, sir. Are we still at school? Sorry, when you called I had already asked her, I couldn't cancel. Has something happened? What is this? Your father's notebook. He took notes about Göbekli Tepe. How? Where did this come from? I hid it. After his death, I hid it. I had it. Why didn't you give it to me before? Necessity. So, why are you giving it to me now? Because of this. Did my father draw this? That's not possible. I found this. No one had been there for thousands of years. He couldn't have. Every secret waits for its calling to come out. Meaning, it was its time, son. Let me know when... We only have a very short time, but don't worry, we will work with a very experienced team. We don't want a flashy wedding, anyway. It's going to be simple. Sweetheart, this happens once in a lifetime. Let's have the best of everything. Ms. Ayşegül, you understand my daughter-in-law. Everything will be simple, but befitting our standards, right? Zeus... - Then... - By the way... I have no doubt Ms. Cansu will surpass all the haute couture designers of Paris. Thanks. Please forgive me if I stepped out of line. Let's proceed with the menus. Atik. Fusion pieces of sea bass on a bed of spinach with satsuma, French sauce with truffle and steamed caviar. Aren't these a little... - Cansu. - Cliché. Mrs. Cansu is right. Atiye wouldn't like meat anyway. We'd like a primarily vegetable-based menu, please. Also, strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Atiye's favorite. Don't do that, dear. Don't do what, honey? I'll be right back. Please, God, stop this sound. Atiye, what happened? - Atiye, dear, did you see someone? - What happened? - In there! - What did you see? - What's in there? - In there. - What? - Ozan! Atiye, there is nothing there. What happened, Atiye? - There's nothing in there. What happened? - Calm down. What did you see? Where is it, dear? Here... I... I love this picture. Your sister's smile is just like yours. You never talk about it. Maybe if I ask? Car crash. See if there's any beer. Okay. Is it hot in here? Don't know. Yes... So, tell me what you've been doing. Apart from the mysterious discoveries. I'll tell you. I have some things to do. Can't it wait? Go on. "THIS DISCOVERY CAN CHANGE HISTORY AS WE KNOW IT" What did the doctor say, Mustafa? Nothing. He's waiting for the test results. I think we should take Atiye back to ours. Everything can be handled there. Oh, no, Mr. Serdar, this is better. We don't even know what happened yet. It won't be nice if the press finds out, Mr. Mustafa. A lot of people will swarm here. Right? Mr. Serdar is right, Mustafa. There'd be a scandal if this got out. Maybe we can decide when Atiye wakes up? Let's do what makes her most comfortable. Anyway, my offer stands. I'm sorry, I have an important meeting. I'm sorry, again. Thank you. Doctor, are the results back? Come, let's talk outside. Ozan? Sweetie. What happened? We're at the hospital. You had a kind of seizure, remember? I don't want to remember. We talked to the doctor. Your results all came back clear. No abnormalities. Then what's with your face? It's just, they wanted to refer you to another doctor. A really good doctor. A professor. Ms. Seda. A psychiatrist. A psychiatrist? When you're ready. She's expecting us. - Hello? - Hello, Atiye. - It's Erhan. Listen... - My sister is not available now. I'm her sister. Can I speak to Atiye right away? - She can't talk now. - Let me make myself clear. It is important and urgent. Please pass me to Atiye. Let me make myself clear. She can't talk because she is currently in hospital, asleep. In hospital? Why? The sedatives might be a little overwhelming at first. Yes... You spoke of seeing an old woman. Yes, I saw her. Who is this woman? Had you seen her before? No, I don't recognize her. Does she have a name? I'm pretty sure she does, but hasn't deigned to tell me. Okay. Can you tell me what was the last thing you saw before the seizure? Sure. A coffin... ...with me inside. I was dead, and trying to open the coffin with my nails. Okay. And there is the matter of the painting. For years, you've been drawing something which has been discovered in Göbekli Tepe. Yes. Do you think you're special, Mrs. Atiye? That you're important? Wouldn't you? Wouldn't we all want to believe we're special? I mean, could you be an oracle, since you knew of a symbol that was created thousands of years ago? You think I would be here if I was an oracle? Ms. Atiye, I need to see you regularly. Let's start with three times a week. In addition to this, it's crucial you start your medication. You know what the problem is, then? I wouldn't call it a problem. Just call it a diagnosis. What you've talked about sounds like paranoid schizophrenia. Your family history of it makes it more of a possibility. Our family? We will talk about all this. When the time is right. Alright. Let's not take up more of the doctor's time since she is tired and mixing up her patients, saying our family has schizophrenia and suchlike. There's a misunderstanding. She wants to see me three times a week. Dad? I would say to listen to the doctor. Let's first understand what we need to do next. Honey. Sis. I'm here, alright? Everything will go back to normal, don't worry. Ozan, I want to go home. Sis. The doctor wants you to stay a bit longer. Okay, I'll take care of it. I'm going to talk to them right now. I'm handling it, okay? I sent our parents away. How can there be schizophrenia in the family? Did you know? No. I just found out as well. Erhan? Atiye. Sorry to hear what happened. What the... I said not to come. He tricked me, saying he would send flowers. What happened? Nothing much, just picked up some schizophrenia. What? Never mind. Why are you here? We need to talk. I'm sorry, but can you talk later on? My sister needs to rest. Can you give us a minute? Do you not understand? I'm serious, it's important. I'm serious, too. I'm too exhausted to talk. I'll ask one question and leave. Really. Is there any chance you knew my dad? Nazım Kurtiz? No. Think hard. Your name is in my dad's notebook. I didn't know it existed. Look, it's written here. Don't be ridiculous. Here, look. He wrote it with something phosphoric, it's only visible in the dark. I don't know your dad. Can I get some rest now? He was an archaeologist. Worked in Göbekli Tepe for years. So you, this symbol... There may be a connection. Please. Think. Can't it be some other Atiye? Maybe Zühre? Did you ever hear the name Zühre? - No. - Think of your childhood. Sister Zühre, Auntie Zühre... - Someone around my dad's age? - Erhan. Just look around at where we are. What do you think this is? And why? Why? Because I'm hallucinating, hearing voices. Old women, young shepherd girls with star tattoos, weird voices. They call it schizophrenia. I'm crazy, apparently. Come on, go. Go. Please, call me if you think of anything, alright? - What's going on? - Sorry to hear the news. Look here a second. What are you doing here? Visiting a patient. I'm never going to see you around Atiye again. Understand? And why? I don't need a reason. I want it that way. Calm down, champ. I came to your fiancée for research. I have no other intentions. Atiye has not been well since she went to Göbekli Tepe or whatever it is. You will never be around her again and I will never see you again. Got that? Kismet. Are the claims true that Göbekli Tepe was built to communicate with aliens? Let's see if the newly discovered tablet at Göbekli Tepe can solve the mystery. While researchers are approaching the subject with different theories, the excavations are still... I made linden tea. Have some. Mom, did you put this painting in the sunlight? No. Its color has changed. I don't know, has it? It's faded. It's right under your noses and you didn't realise. Fine, you'll just make a new one. Take your meds. Aren't you going to tell me? What? The doctor mentioned our family history. Who has schizophrenia? Atiye, you just need to rest. Take your meds. You have your wedding. If anything happens, call me. In Asia, cranes are considered the messengers of the gods. The Chinese and the Vietnamese believe that cranes carry the souls of the deceased into heaven. According to the Bektashi, cranes are the representation of God on Earth. That is why cranes are sacred. The crane also represents the shepherd's star, meaning it represents Venus. This star, Venus, is called Zühre in our culture. Did you ever hear the name Zühre? - Hello, Erhan? - Hello. There was a folder in the professor's room. It fell onto the floor. There was a paper in it that had the name Zühre Altın on it. Zühre? Are you sure? Yes. I think so. Atiye, what do you mean "you think"? Are you sure or not? I'm not sure of anything anymore. What happened, schätze? Don't let me interrupt. Sorry, beg your pardon. Who are you calling? You have the keys to Öner's office, right? What is it at this hour, sir? Forgot the kids' papers, Bekir. - Alright, sir. - Alright. ERHAN ARCHAEOLOGIST Come on, Atiye, pick up the phone. Come on. Yes? Hello. Did you see the picture I sent you? What? What picture? Check your phone. I sent a picture. Is that the woman you saw? Yeah, that's her. What? So, it's her? Where did you find this? Okay. Come here, right away. I'm sending my location. Come at once. Answer me first. Where did you find it? I'll tell you later. I'm at the school. Erhan? Erhan? Erhan? Hello? Erhan? Erhan? Erhan, are you okay? - Can you hear me? - Atiye. I'm fine. I'm fine. What happened? My dad's notebook. The folder. Fuck, the folder is gone! What happened? Did you see who did it? I didn't, but my phone and wallet are here. The notebook and the folder are gone. Fuck. The picture. Where did you find it? In the folder. But it's not just a picture. There is an address on the back. Subtitle translation by Didem İpekoğlu
