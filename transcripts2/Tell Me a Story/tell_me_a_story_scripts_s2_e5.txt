 Previously, on "Tell Me A Story"... Do you recognize him? His name's Kyle Verafield. He's a grad student at Vandy. He couldn't protect you, but I can. Thank you for saving me. My dad left me nothing? Two months ago, he was going on about leaving the business to you. She must have changed the trust. Did Dad still have that old safe hidden in his office? You must do it on this thing

 This doesn't prove that she killed him. But it does prove she's not the grieving widow. Help me! Relax. - It's okay. - What do you want from me? You're gonna help me. I'm a writer. My new book is about love and loss. Who's Anna? You never told her? - Anna was my twin. - What happened to her? We'd play on this dock. I don't know how she fell in. When I'm out here, it's like she's still here with me.

 Well, I get it now. Why you love it out here so much. Yeah, it's peaceful, isn't it? And you feel closer to your sister. Anna and I, we made some... great memories out here. Maybe one day our kids will, too. Okay. Let's go inside. It's getting chilly. Sorry. You had a long day. Yeah. Do you want me to stay? No. You've got work tomorrow. I'll be okay. - Thank you, though. - Okay. Who's Olivia? Yeah, I was gonna tell you about her. We met on Tinder. How do you feel about three-ways? - She's hot. - Oh, yeah? I'm sure. Who is she? She's my editor's new assistant. Checks in with me every day to see how the pages are coming along. Olivia. I am really glad that you came. Me, too. Oh, the water heater's acting up. It's so old. Help me. Help... I'm gonna go. I got to check up on that boiler. It's gonna keep me up all night. Mmm. I'll walk you out. Drive safe. - I love you. - I love you, too. Stop doing that. Damn it, Anna! Stop. Anna? Olivia. It's late. We should get some rest. No. No! *TELL ME A STORY* Season 02 Episode 05 *TELL ME A STORY* Episode Title: "Episode# 2.5" Sync corrections by srjanapala Hey. Hey. How are you doing? Okay. All right. Last night was enough for anyone. Hey. Take a deep breath. You can relax now. Can I? I know that Kyle is dead. Something's not quite right. What? It's an instinct, like a gut feeling. Kyle talked to me like he loved me. So, what are you saying? You're saying, like, - that the psychology doesn't fit? - Yeah, maybe. Some of the things that he said... That he would never hurt me, that... he wanted to protect me, just... didn't seem like someone who wanted to kill me. He broke into your house, came at you with a knife. Yes, I know it. The bomber should be Kyle. It's logical. It makes sense. I just wish I could be sure, and... I'm not. Okay. So I'll look into it. Thank you. I just want you to feel safe. I got to get to work. We'll talk later. Mm. That's Clay Callaway. Callaway? Why do I know that name? He's managing partner at your father's law firm. The same firm that drafted Frank's trust. I knew it. My dad would never cut me out. This proves it. No. All this proves is that Veronica is a liar and a cheat. Maybe that's enough. Reputation means everything to Veronica. Imagine what her country club friends would say. What are you thinking? The art benefit is tonight. They're honoring Dad. And Veronica will be there. The perfect place to let her know what I know. What will that do besides piss her off? It's hard to get away with murder, Cora. The killer always slips up. I'm gonna turn up the heat and see if I can make that happen. Well, it's a formal affair. Then, I'll need something nice. You leave that to me. Hey. One second. Talk to my son. I thought they were already done. Just wrapping up. Jeff called. He's, uh, being released from the hospital. Minor concussion, and he wants to come back to work tomorrow. Nice to hear some good news. I'm gonna be in - the monitor room. - Hold up. Tell me something. Why were you outside with Ashley when Kyle snuck into the house? I had to talk to her about something. About her security needs? Not-not exactly. I watched the footage from yesterday. The way you looked at her, the body language. You'd have to be blind not to see it. It's-it's not like that. Rebecca saw you and Ashley kissing. Last night? This morning. I told you to keep it professional. Yeah, I know. I... I'm-I'm so sorry. Rebecca thinks it's best that you leave. I agreed. I can still do my job. It's not a discussion. You're gonna finish out today, and then you're done. Pops... Fuck. Oh, good, Jackson is here, and almost on time. Good morning. You're all looking exceptionally beautiful. Wow, someone's in a good mood. And why shouldn't I be? Ashley escaped her psycho stalker, we are all here together, and there are doughnuts. Tasty baked goods. Hey, Mom, uh... Dad's old tuxedo still around? I have no idea. Why? I just have a... event I have to go to. Ooh, with a girl? Yeah, with a girl. Oh. Uh, I met a girl. - Of course you did. - Mom, why do you always have to get on him? Can't you see he's trying? So, Ashley, you really take down this attacker? I barely remember it. It's like I was on autopilot or something. I just kept thinking, "Please, don't let him hurt Susie." How is she doing? Spending time with her family in Memphis. Well, remind me to never mess with you. It wasn't just me. Beau helped. So modest. - You're a badass. Own it. - Mm-hmm. Jackson is right, for once. Come on. Let's go get that tux. Great idea. I'm proud of you. You were so brave, and I'm just so relieved to have all of this done. It's not over. I don't think Kyle was the bomber. - What are you talking about? - I don't think he's the one that tried to kill me. That person's still out there. Honey, you've had a traumatic experience. Last night... - That's not what this is about. - You're gonna feel safe eventually. It's just gonna take time. Beau believes me. He's looking into it. Beau isn't going to be working here anymore. I had to let him go. You can't do that. I know that you have developed feelings... That's not what this is about. Honey, you are vulnerable right now. Your feelings are not real. Oh, yeah? How would you know that? - Ashley... - Beau stays. You almost done in there? I got to say, you've been really good for me, Olivia. I've already written 20 pages this morning. Book's really coming together. Want to give them a read? Could use another point of view. Who's Anna? Last night, you called me Anna. I want to know who she is. We're not talking about her. Tell me who Anna is. She's gone. Stop saying her name. I know she's not one of the girls buried in your rose bushes. You want to talk about the past? All right. Let's talk about Luke. You tell me about Luke, and I will tell you who Anna was. - I already told you about him. - Not everything. You see, I did a little Google search. It turns out Luke wasn't exactly Mr. Wonderful, was he? You guys had a few run-ins, hmm? Disturbing the peace, a little domestic violence. Did he hit you? Of course not. Then why did the police show up at your doorstep? Because we had a bitch of a landlady. Stuck her nose in everyone's business, told the police that he was abusing me. Believe me, I know when I'm being abused. Your turn. Anna was my sister. This was my grandfather's cabin. We spent a lot of time here. Was all this stuff hers? She used to love that night-light. We couldn't sleep without it. Is that why I'm here? To replace your sister? I should get back to work. Is that it? Answer me! Ashley, uh, I brought somebody here to see you. Detective Roberts. She's come to hear you out. Unofficially, of course. Beau tells me you don't think Kyle was the bomber. I'm sorry, it just... doesn't make sense. Forgive me, but we're talking about a psycho with a fire fetish. You saw what he did to his body. But his burns were new. I think he burned himself after my attack. But that doesn't actually prove anything. He was at the hotel that night. He filmed the explosion with his phone. Yeah. So did a lot of people, from what I've seen online. I understand your concern. - I do... - Really? Do you know what it's like to have someone want you dead? To live in fear, always looking over your shoulder? - Ms. Rose... - I'm sorry to make more work for you, but unless you show me proof that Kyle is the one who blew up my car... this nightmare isn't over. I will definitely take your concerns into account. Gwen? You're blowing her off. It's not me. The department wants this case closed. Okay, so answer me this. Did you find any bomb-making materials at his place? No. He might've built the device somewhere else. - Pretty advanced, if you ask me. - Not really. I mean, anyone can figure out how to build a pipe bomb - on the Internet. - Did he? Have you even looked through his search history yet? Yeah. It was clean. What if you just slipped me a copy of the case file? Jesus... Beau. Can't toe the blue line to protect one of your own, but... now you want to break the rules? Is this really worth it? What she is saying deserves a closer look. Yeah, well... there's lots of footage we haven't gone through. This guy filmed everything, so... Well... I got nothing but free time. Yeah. All right, these look great, Maddie. Let's overnight 'em, so it gets there before noon. Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. Bullshit. I think Tucker's having an affair. God. What makes you think that? I found a woman's number in his cabin. Someone named Olivia. He said that she was his editor's new assistant. I checked... She's not. So, are you gonna talk to him? I don't know, what's the point? He already lied. Yeah, but don't you want to know for sure? I don't know... what I want. You are... lovely. The spitting image of your mother. Do you miss her? Of course. She was my best friend. I loved those nights at the distillery, watching Mom work, bossing everyone around, even Dad. She was a force of nature. I wanted to be just like her. You are. No. I'm not. I know you've had your... struggles. You can say it. You don't have to tiptoe. I'm an ex-con. Well, you were dealt a terrible hand. I used to say the same thing. Gave me an excuse for falling for bad men. For lying and stealing. But I made those choices. No one else. Well, everyone deserves a second chance. I'm not sure I'm worthy. I don't believe that. And neither do you. You could have taken Veronica's money and run, but you are here. I owe it to Dad to get the truth. You are a vision. There's one more thing. My secret weapon. And now they're yours. They're beautiful. Thank you, Cora, for everything. I can't wait to see the look on Veronica's face. I guess Dad's arms were longer than mine. It's okay. We can pin up the sleeves. Hey, are you sure you're up for this? Could use the distraction. Music used to be my way of dealing. My escape from all the shitty things in my life. Are you still not singing? I've tried. But something isn't right. My voice feels different. You probably just need practice. We need a jam session. Or maybe I could just use a little more rest. Stay still. Sorry. There you go. Your mystery woman's gonna love this. Hey, Ashley... Who is she, big bro? She's just some girl. She got you in a tux. I think that says it all. It's new, but I really like her. It's been a long time since I've seen that tux. You look handsome. Just like your dad. But you're missing one thing. Dad's cuff links. You should try 'em on. - ♪ The story of my life... - He loved these. ♪ Some whiskey tore right out Perfect. - ♪ And others time erases... - Thanks, Mom. Please don't pawn them. ♪ It's written on their faces ♪ The story of my life... ♪ Some whiskey tore right out ♪ And others time erases ♪ It's sad but true, this life I knew ♪ ♪ But it taught me what grace is. ♪ Here we go. It's a big day for my girl. Today her first album finally drops. After tonight, everyone everywhere is gonna know the name Ashley Rose. Must be losing my mind. 'Cause I swear we talked about this already. You already fired me, so you can't do that again. What kind of number has this woman done on you? I did not call you in here for another lecture. Please sit down. I have something critical I need to show you. Now, this guy, he spent half of his time filming Ashley. There's a ton of footage, but look at this. And there it is. Her Porsche. ThePorsche. Her present to herself when her album presale numbers came out. It's just so her. He was in the garage that night, where the valet kept her car and where there were no cameras. Look. So her. Get a load of this guy. Of course he has to touch her car. He wasn't the bomber. But looks like he got the actual bomber on film. I've sent some stills of this guy over to my friend at NPD, and I'm just waiting on an ID. Great work, son. Thank you. The past few days have been difficult, to say the least. Frank's recent passing has left a hole in my heart and in my life. But Frank was an ardent supporter of the arts, which is why I am so happy to be representing him here at the Nashville County Arts Federation. And... So... And so... please join me in raising a glass to my late husband. To Frank Garland. - To Frank... - To Frank... Simone. What the hell is she doing here? Just calm down. - Want me to call security? - I'll call security. No. Let's not make a scene. Mr. Mayor.Veronica. I am so honored you could attend. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Thank you. For you. I almost didn't recognize you. I clean up well. Yes, you do. You look... Radiant? Beguiling? Captivating? Yeah, all those words and more. And this dress is... Alluring? - Ravishing? - Hold on, hold on. I got this one. Enchanting. Just like the woman wearing it. Dance with me? So, what am I doing here exactly? Let's call it moral support. First time I've been used for my morals. First time for everything. I thought we'd have an ID by now. It hasn't been that long. We'll give it some time. Look, I know I behaved... totally unprofessionally. I'm sorry. It's fine to care. You just can't cross that line. I know, I just... Facial ID got a hit. Dylan Young. He's been in and out of prison since he was 13. You found him, son. Before anybody else. That's great work. 706 Nassau. Beau, NPD can take it from here. Gwen will have to convince the captain to reopen the case... Could take days. I don't need to remind you, you're not a cop anymore. I'm just doing a drive-by. Wait one damn second, will you? If you're gonna pretend to be a cop for a day... I'm not gonna let you do it alone. Mind if I cut in? Yes, I do. It's fine. Enjoy. Thought you were leaving town. Changed my mind. I'm glad. Mom isn't a murderer, Simone. - She really loved Dad. - She loved his money. - She says the same thing about you. - Hmm. I mean... I don't believe her. You're much better than you were in high school. Thanks. Remember when you taught me to waltz for spring formal? You wanted to impress that girl. What was her name? Deanna.Right. She was sweet. Sweet of you to teach me to dance. You were always nice to me. Would you excuse me? Yeah. Sure. Simone. What a surprise. Yeah, she's full of 'em. How's the nose? You were supposed to leave town. Now I need to call the cops and tell them about your little break-in at the distillery. I guess I'll need a lawyer. I hear Clay Callaway's good. I know the two of you were having an affair. Got a lot of nerve, Simone. You vanish for years, you want to come back in here, running your mouth? I have proof. Photos. My father had you under surveillance. No. You fucked Clay Callaway until he agreed to change the trust. And then you pushed my dad down the stairs. You have no idea what goes on inside a marriage. I loved Frank, but he was not the perfect husband. And whatever I did or did not do with Mr. Callaway is proof of nothing. We'll let the police decide. Not to mention the court of public opinion. Okay, here it is. Thank you so much. Simone. I am done with you harassing this family. Go back to where the fuck you came from! Back off! If you kick the hornet's nest, you're gonna get stung. Excuse me, I think this belongs to you. Hey! You're not the only one that box, pretty boy. I realize that now. Stop! Stop! Stop it, you two. I said enough! Go back to your mommy, Ron. You've been warned. It was nice fighting with you. Hey. Moral support, remember? Sorry. You're bleeding. Eh, it's not the first time. I'm gonna go get cleaned up. I'll wait for you outside. If memory serves, you're a bourbon man. So, what did Maddie tell you? She thinks you're having an affair. Well, I'm not. Oh, well, she's checked up on you. Did a little digging. Olivia isn't your editor's assistant. Who is she? She's an assistant publicist. It was a simple misunderstanding. Right. You know, not that it's any of your business, but I would never cheat on Maddie. Oh, you sure about that? 'Cause I might do some digging myself. What does any of this have to do with you? I just care about Maddie. Oh.More than you do, I think. I see. Well... Maddie loves me, and nothing's gonna change that, no matter how badly you want her back. You know, a big part of my job is, uh, to recognize when someone's lying to me. And you, Tucker, strike me as a liar. Not a very good one. Maddie deserves better. I haven't lied to Maddie. We'll see. Mind your own fucking business. Nice hood. Hey. That's Young. Where's he going? Beau. Hey, Beau. Hey, Dylan. Dylan Young? Yeah. Yeah, private security. I just got a couple questions for you. Um, sure. Uh, we can talk inside. Let me just grab my keys real quick. I got him. No. No. Fuck, no. No, no, no, no. Oh. It's all right. It's all right. I got you. I got you. It's okay. Yeah, I need an ambulance. Now. To... 706 Nassau Street. It's all right. It's... Come on, look at me now. Just-just stay with me. I got you, all right? I got you. Come on, Pops. You're gonna stay with me, all right? You're gonna stay with me. It's all right, I got you. Fuck! Fuck. Anna? Anna. Anna. Hey. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. What the fuck? Help! Help me, please! In the pocket. The keys. Hurry. Please. Which side? Please hurry! Hurry, please. Fuck. Come on, let's go. You're crazy! Olivia! Sync corrections by srjanapala
