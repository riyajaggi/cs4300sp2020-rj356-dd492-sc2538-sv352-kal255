Here we go. Beau Morris. I thought that was you. Officer Miller. You look good. Vacation's treating you well. Yeah. Don't think my buddy's enjoying himself quite as much, though. Now you got nothing to say. Wish you showed that same restraint with I.A. You gonna tell me what you pulled me over for? I need to see a license for that gun. Are you serious? Are you failing to comply? Slowly. Saw you on TV escorting Ashley Rose from the hospital. Wonder if babysitting pop stars has made you reconsider your story. You mean the truth? I'd be careful with that gun. One of us real cops might get the wrong idea you're reaching for it. Good day. Fuck! Did you read the pages I sent? Mm. Yep. Deposition date was off by a year, and you misspelled plaintiff's name. Last time you made a mistake that big was... dumping me in law school. I think your wife would disagree. Point taken. Sorry, I've just been preoccupied. Anything I can help with? Uh-uh. Well... Maybe. Okay, um... Did you ever second-guess the whole... getting married thing? Yeah, of course I second-guess. Till death do us part? That's some crazy cult shit. Yeah. Yeah. I know, but you and Christine seem so happy. We are happy. Well, except when we're not. But that's marriage. Is there trouble in Tucker land? No, I didn't say there was trouble. It's just, I don't know. He's just been so distant. He's just not himself. He's not sleeping. Maybe it's pre-wedding jitters. I don't know. It's probably nothing. I'm sure it'll all work out. Yeah. What happened? The beast got out of its cage. Look, Ash, you're allowed to be hurt and mad at the world. I can... I can take it in. Get it fixed up good as new. All right? Thank you. Oh, and your mom wanted me to give you this. This is a joke, right? I don't think so. Where are you going? To break more shit. Hey, did you know about this? About what? This. Your press interviews? Of course. Your new single released today. We need to support it. Standard operating procedure. So you knew. You knew, too. You signed off. Yeah, before someone tried to kill me. Listen, I understand how difficult this is. The label determines your press schedule, not us. They felt that this would be a great opportunity... To capitalize on my trauma? Ash, your fans, they love you. People love a comeback. This isn't a comeback. - It's a freak show. - It's not a freak show. People genuinely want to see you. Okay. Get Damien over here now. I'll kill this if you won't. Again? I'm sorry... I thought your job was to protect me, not constantly get in my way. - Ma'am, I'm... - I don't need excuses. Stay the hell away from me. This could be her. Who we got? False alarm. It's just the assistant. What are you doing? Quitting. What happened? Look, I appreciate the job, Pops, but this isn't for me; I am a cop. Not right now you're not. Come on. Give it a chance. I didn't raise no quitter. At least give me some time to find a replacement. Bye, Daddy. Simone. You didn't tell us you were coming. It's my father's funeral. I can't believe he's gone. So sorry about it. He was a good man. So sad. So very sorry. We both are. I understand there's a reception at the house. Yes. Yes, of course there is. You should join us. Well, only if it wouldn't be an intrusion. - You must go... - Not at all. Um... It's a difficult day for all of us. Do what you think is right. You got to come to yoga more. Really? 'Cause I'm still stressed. Your cat will turn up. I shouldn't have moved. Change can be very hard on cats. It's not your fault. You can't put your life on hold for a cat. I wish I stayed in Oklahoma. Everything's gone to shit since moving here. Hey, that's not true. Isn't it? Grant and I broke up. I'm waitressing again. And I think I'm allergic to the water here, because I'm breaking out like crazy. Well, how's grad school going? I took the semester off. Yeah. Comparative literature is starting to feel like another bad idea. I'm sorry, but I should run. Thank you for the coffee and yoga. Yeah. Bye. Shit. Knock, knock. Hey, look. It's the talk of the town. Congratulations. You have already surpassed your first single in downloads. Are you kidding me, Damien? I'm dead serious. The West Coast are barely waking up. We're gonna be at a million by this afternoon. This song is gonna be huge. Let me put those flowers in some water. How could you do this? I haven't been out of the hospital a whole day, and you want to parade me in front of a bunch of TV cameras looking like this? Ashley, we don't know what the future holds, okay? But right now, we have a hit single on our hands, if we use the right press appearances. I am not ready. I can barely stand to look at myself in the mirror. Look, I don't want to be this guy, but you signed a contract. Does she have to do TV? Can she do phoners, print, radio? Some of the key markets. I understand your reluctance. I do. But TV is an integral part of our brand strategy pyramid. "Brand strategy pyramid." What kind of marketing bullshit is that? Look, I hear your concerns. I do. Okay? We want what's best for you. So, for now, we'll do things on your terms. My terms? Your terms. Great. Well, then, here are my terms. Get the hell out of my house. It's all part of my strategic go-fuck-yourself pyramid. Shit. Ma'am. I'm just going for a walk. I don't need a babysitter. It's my job to keep you safe. Fine. Do it from a distance. Okay. How far would you like me? I don't know. Canada? Sorry. Didn't bring my passport. How about five feet? Ten. Done. See? It's like I'm not even here. No. No, no, no. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? It looks like you're trespassing. Yeah. And if you follow me, you will be, too. Hmm. Rebel. Thank you both for coming. How are you holding up? Taking it day by day. Thank goodness for my boys. So, Ron, how's the business? - I'm Ron. - He's Ron. - He's Derek. - I'm Derek. Of course. Forgive me. The business is doing well, - considering. - And... how is that beautiful girlfriend of yours? She's fine. She broke up with him. We're not together anymore. She wasn't good enough for my son. Thanks, Mom. Sweetheart, would you mind grabbing me another? Of course. Liquid courage? Is it that obvious I need it? No. A little. It's so strange being back in this house. Ten years is a long time. What choice did I have? Your mom hated me. If I'd have stayed any longer, she would've locked me in the attic and thrown away the key. Sometimes she can be... difficult. Look, I know it's been a long time, but give her another chance? She's your mother, too. Stepmother. Simone. Cora? Oh, look at my beautiful goddaughter. Oh... Do you mind if I steal her for a minute? Not at all. I wasn't sure if you had gotten my messages or not. I should've called you back. It's been a rough few days. That's okay. I'm just so glad you're here. Your father would've been, too. Cora, what happened? He fell? They think that at some point in the middle of the night, he must have gotten out of bed to head downstairs and lost his footing. Veronica found him the next morning at the bottom of the stairs. I talked to him just a few months ago on his birthday. - Mm-hmm. - It wasn't much. The whole conversation lasted all of five minutes. He hated talking on the phone. But he loved to hear your voice. How are things at the distillery? Tough without your father, but we're managing. Ron and Derek work there now. They plan to step up. I'm sure they're wonderful assets. You got the "ass" part right. Cora, I've missed you. I've missed you, too. We're gonna need a proper catch-up before you leave town, okay? - Okay. Of course. - Promise? Okay. I'm so sorry I'm late. Traffic on 65 was awful. - It always is. - It's fine. Hi. Thank you so much for hosting, Rebecca. Yeah. Of course. Anything for Maddie. I'm gonna leave you two. My, uh, vote is on the hazelnut praline. It is so yummy. Maddie? - We can get started. - Excellent. So, this first one is our salted caramel. - Very, very popular. - Mmm. Oh, my God. That's, like... That's, like, the best thing I've ever tasted. Thanks. - Do you love it? Hmm? - Actually, um, I'm so sorry. I don't want to do this. Not like this. Why don't I give you two a moment? Thank you. Maddie, I understand you're upset. I actually don't think you do. Look, last night, I wasn't at my best... It's not about last night, Tucker. It's about everything. It's the... it's the-the late nights and the distracted days. The constant excuses. I'm only getting half of you. - What is going on? - Nothing. I'm... I'm fine. You're fine? You're not fine. I don't think you're fine. I spent years watching my mother pretend like everything was fine with my dad. I won't do that. Wait, come on, Maddie. - Maddie. Hey, come on. Come on. - Would you just stop? I'm not... It's not you. Then what is it? It's my publisher. Okay? They're not happy with my pages. Tripp said they're cutting my order. Okay? There's even talk of pushing my publishing date. Why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't want to disappoint you. Do you think any of this matters? I love you, Tucker. Not Tucker the writer. I love you. I wouldn't care if you never wrote another word. But I would. It's who I am. Yeah. I got to go back to work. Okay. Honey, come on. Let's figure this out. No, I think that you need to figure things out, because something has to change. Now we're breaking and entering. You always this by the book? When I'm on duty, yeah. Hi, boy. Bet you're the kind of cop that gives tickets for jaywalking. Well, it's illegal. The Mullens are cool neighbors. Said I could come over and ride whenever I want. Hi, Scout. He likes you. Oh, he knew me before I turned into a bitch. This is when you're supposed to tell me that I'm not a bitch. You've been through a lot. I get it. Yeah, wish my mom did. And Damien. They just want me to pick up right where I left off, like nothing happened. I'm sure they're just doing what they think is best. Yeah, for me or my career? Hey, I heard your new song. And I liked it a lot. It was better than your first song. Yeah. That's 'cause I wrote it. The first one was a label demand, noisy and overproduced. Well, for what it's worth, I think you should only sing your own stuff. That new song is... it's-it's real honest. I agree. Doesn't really matter anymore. None of it does. You got talent. You got that thing, the ability to tap into something real and touch people. Just imagine the songs that you're gonna write next. That's not what the label wants. They want a pity party. They want to trot me out on some press tour and hope that people feel so sorry for me that they pay $1.29 for a new song, so they can recoup money off their bad investment. Well, I don't know about all that, but... you're in a tough business. I know what that's like. I highly doubt that. What I mean is I know what it's like to feel the pressure to do something that you don't want to do. How can I sit and talk about my career when I don't even know if I can sing anymore? It's like everything I knew, everything I was, is... ...is just gone. You're still right here. I'm staring right at you. You're gonna get through this. I'll do radio. That's it. Okay. Thank you. Veronica. Simone, sweetheart. Did you get something to eat? I did, yeah. Thank you. Frank would've loved that berry cobbler. That man had a sweet tooth like no other. Dad hated cobbler. Excuse me? Dad always said people make cobbler when they're too lazy to make pie. That didn't take long. I knew the real Simone would emerge. - I didn't come here to fight. - Then why did you come here? Because if it's for your father, you're about ten years too late. I was notified by a lawyer that the reading of Dad's trust is tomorrow. Oh, so you came here with your hand out? And you didn't? You abandoned your father. You abandoned this family. And you feel like you're owed something? Yes. Because as far as I can tell, I'm the only one in this room who was related to my father by blood. When I saw you today, I actually thought you were here to mourn the death of your father. I should've known better. - I think you should go. - I think you should go. Simone, wait. I didn't just come home for my father's money. I know you didn't.That woman is evil. You may be more right than you know. What do you mean? I didn't want to bring this up today with the funeral and everything... No, no, tell me. What do you know? - He fell down stairs? - What are you saying? When did you know your father to do something like that? I haven't known my father in ten years. He was a healthy man. The only thing wrong with him was his choice in women. He didn't fall down stairs. I know Veronica is a horrible woman, but she's not capable of something like that, is she? You're right. I'm just... I'm just upset. Forget I even said anything. No. No. Cora. Cora. Well, thanks anyway. - Oh! Oh, my God. - Ow. - Are-are you okay? - Oh, my... Sorry, sorry. - I didn't see you. - I'm-I'm so sorry. - No, no, you know what? - I wasn't looking where I was... It was my bad. I wasn't... Sorry. Sorry. Is that a J-45? - Uh, I don't know. - D-Do you mind if I...? Sure. This is a vintage Recording King Lily of the Valley. How old is this? Uh, it's the boss's. It's pretty busted up. Yeah. Beyond repair, apparently. That sucks. What do you do that you get to play with guitars? Uh, what do you mean? Sounds like you have a cool job. Oh, uh, well, actually, I-I work for someone pretty well-known, but I signed a bunch of NDAs, so I can't really talk about it. Oh. Well, I won't pry, but whoever your mystery employer is, she's lucky to have you. How'd you know it was a she? I-I didn't. 50/50. Just trying to be all woke, I guess. Not all bosses are men. Right, okay. Um, do you play? I wish. What do you do for work? I'm actually a-a-a graduate student over at Vandy. That's a great school. What do you study there? Psychology. Nice. Hey, I was actually gonna grab some coffee. Do you want some? Um... I'm so sorry, was that too forward? No. No. No, it wasn't too forward. It was, um, sweet. I just... I'm kind of on the clock, so... Mm... probably shouldn't. Uh, but, I don't know, maybe you want to give me a call sometime? I'd love that. Great. Um, give me your number, I'll-I'll-I'll text you my... text you my digits.Okay. We're on the phone with Ashley Rose, whose new single "Nobody Knows" hit the airwaves this morning, and our listeners have not been able to get enough ever since. Ashley, thank you so much for chatting with us. Thank you for having me. So, after everything you've been through, I'm curious how it's felt to see people responding to the song the way they have today. Oh, my God, it feels incredible. I just... I'm so thrilled that it's finally out in the world. So are we. Whose decision was it to release such a heartfelt ballad as your second single? Um, it was always planned. Interesting. Tell us, how are you doing since the pipe bomb attack that nearly claimed your life? Um, it hasn't been easy, but, uh, thanks to the support of my fans, my loved ones and the amazing team of doctors, I'm ready to put that behind me. Have you spoken to Charles Mayfield since the attack? Who? The valet who pulled you from the car before the second explosion. Um... We sent him flowers.Um... Oh, um, yeah, of course. Um, un-unfortunately, I've been so focused on my recovery that... Like I said, I'm ready to move beyond that and focus on the music. So, tell me, then, what does the future look like for Ashley Rose? Ashley, did we lose you? Can you repeat that question? I'm just wondering, where do you go from here? Um... What's next? I-I-I... Ashley, uh, has another interview, but thank you so much. Prick. All right, that's all the time we have. Thank you so much, Ashley. Let's play her new single one more time. Here's "Nobody Knows." ♪ I bet you think you know me ♪ I bet you think you care... Are you Tucker? That's me. Oh, my God. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, don't even mention it. No, seriously, I was freaking out. Well, I got really lucky. She just wandered right into my yard. My little explorer. Where is she? Uh, funny story. She really did not enjoy being caught. Oh, no, she bit you. Yeah, but it's not nearly as bad as it looks. I'm so sorry. Please, it's water under the bridge. But you can understand why I was a little bit skittish about taking her out of the cage. Yeah. Do you mind? Sure. Thanks. Honestly, I can't blame her. I've never been very good with pets. There she is. Ugh. Hi, crazy girl. I've missed you. You gave me quite a scare. Come here... Yeah? You okay? I've been better. I am so sorry. I, uh... I... was wrong to put you in that position. I am asking you as your mother: what can I do for you? Tell me what to do, and I will do it. I want to go to bed. I'm tired. I am here, and I am listening, and if you need to talk... I really am tired. ...you can talk to me. Or you can talk to someone else. We can... we can call that doctor, and we can make an appointment. Okay. What are you doing here? Oh, this-this is my favorite curb. I just sit here all the time. Is that right? Okay. Maybe I was waiting for you. And yet, I don't recall giving you my address. You didn't. You also didn't give me your last name or your number. And you still didn't get the hint. I like a challenge. How'd you find me? Well, it was simple. Uh, when you walked in the bar, I, of course, first noticed your beautiful personality and the confident way that you carry yourself. Then I might have noticed your legs, accentuated by a pair of high heels. Personality and confidence before the legs? Of course. I am a gentleman. Anyway, the bartender told me you weren't local. And because you were wearing those... leg-accentuating high heels, I figured you didn't walk far. Checked a couple local hotels. Here I am. Why would someone go to all that trouble? Look, it's been a bad day, so... Well, maybe this will make it better. There you go. It's too bad, Jackson. What is? That you're such a gentleman. ♪ Red, red is your color, boy ♪ Did anybody ever tell you that? ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ Ooh, you got me seeing red ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm mad at myself ♪ For loving you ♪ Seeing red ♪ I'm seeing red ♪ Ooh ♪ 'Cause red, red is your color, boy ♪ ♪ Did anybody ever tell you that? ♪ ♪ Ooh, you got me seeing red ♪ 'Cause I'm mad at myself for loving you. ♪ I see you survived. Barely. Well, I appreciate it. Look, I'm gonna pull one of my guys off the Foster job if you want to leave your earpiece and keys. What, you think I'm a quitter? No, I'll stay. I guess I just needed to, uh, clear my... my head. Good night, Pops. I mean... Ken. Sorry again. I was just heading out. Ken will be here through the night.Okay. But I want you to have this. It-it's a panic button. Wear it around your neck for safety. So, if you decide to sneak out and go trespassing again, and you find yourself in need of some assistance... You'll come running? Something like that. Good night, ma'am. Good night. You've reached Madison Pruitt. Please leave a message. Hey, it's me. I, uh, know you don't want to talk, and... it's okay. Obviously, things haven't gone as planned. But I want to see you tomorrow. I believe things will get better, Maddie. I just haven't been sleeping. My head is all messed up. It's just... We'll figure things out. I love you, Maddie.
