 The reading of my father's trust. He left his estate to me. My dad left me nothing? This can't be right. CORA: He was a healthy man. The only thing wrong with him was his choice in women. $50,000?You just take the money and go. Give Veronica a message from me. I think that we got engaged too fast. I don't want to do this.Things are changing. I'm writing. I'm in a good place. ♪ Help me! [screams] Relax. It's okay. Susie?

 Susie? ♪ [Susie sniffles] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Just getting in? I am. How are you? I'm okay. What was that? Something new. It's just a little melody, but I hope it grows up one day. You play? Yeah. Prove it. [playing "Chopsticks"] You're such a liar. [both chuckle]I got you, though. [plays off-key] Okay. Okay, stop. Stop, stop. Come here. Put your finger here. [footsteps approaching] KEN: Morning. Morning, Mr. Morris. Ms. Rose. Beau, can I see you a minute? Sir. What the hell was that? You're not here to be her friend. You're here to protect her.I understand that. Do you?It's my job to keep her safe and happy. No, it's your job to keep her safe and me happy. Yes, sir. Jeff's outside on patrol, so you're in here for the morning. I'm going home. Copy. Um... I'm still waiting to hear back about those license plates that I sent in. I'll let you know as soon as I do. Keep it professional. At all times. [door opens, closes] ♪ [horn blows in distance] [winces] ♪ [door opens, closes] [keys clacking] [sighs] [birds chirping] [children's voices echoing] Wait up, Anna! You're too slow. BOY: Don't go in the water. [whistling] Good morning. [sighs] Look, I know last night was rough, but, uh, let's move past it. Hmm? Start fresh? The silent treatment? Really? Fine. How does it feel to be so small and insecure that you have to kidnap and kill women? Wow. You're tough. Straight for the jugular, huh? Is it just your micro-penis that makes you do such twisted shit? [laughs softly] See, now you're just being rude, when I have been nothing but polite. Go fuck yourself. That's okay. The others didn't want to cooperate, either. [door creaks open] What do you want with me?[chains jangle] [sighs] Well, you know I'm a writer. And, uh, I'm working on a new book. My first one was a meditation on loneliness. Got good reviews, but it didn't do very well. I have a two-book deal and I'm behind on my deadline. So now there's all this... pressure. What does that have to do with me? My new book is about love and loss. How it breaks us down. How we put ourselves back together. That's where you come in. It's helpful if I have a subject who can relate. I don't understand. Tell me about Luke. How do you know about him? Aren't we past that? I do my research. He was a smart kid. Full ride to Oklahoma State. Only 22 years old. What was it? Head injury?I don't want to talk about him. Is he the reason for all the partying? All the moving around, dating losers like Grant? Are you trying to fill the void? What kind of fucked up game is this? No games. It-it was just a headache. Luke played club football and he loved it. One day he came home and he was tired. He said he had his bell rung and I-I didn't think it was serious. [quietly]: But it was. They said he was bleeding from his brain. Nobody knew. A loss like that... changes you, doesn't it? Everyone says give it some time. But that's bullshit. What color were his eyes? What color? Green. Do you miss him? [crying] Every day of my life. I can understand that. This was a really good start. Why me? Because I need you. And you don't know it yet, but you need me, too. [door creaks closed] [lock clicking] [grunts] [exhales] Kyle? [sighs] Hello? [exhales sharply] [garage door opening] Ah. Morning, Jeff.Good morning. You're getting here late. Don't tell anyone? Sure. [car blips] [grunts softly] SIMONE: The trust leaves everything to Veronica. But you don't think my dad would've cut me out entirely... No, I don't. It wasn't two months ago that he was going on about leaving the business to you. It was his way of apologizing. He loved you, Simone. He always hoped that you'd come home. This, this is Veronica's doing. She must have changed the trust. What if there was an original copy of it somewhere? Where are you going with this? Did Dad still have that old safe hidden in his office? How do you know about that? I grew up in that distillery, Cora. Does Veronica know about it? No. Frank always said that a man needed to have some secrets of his own. And the only other person who would have the combination is you. He trusted you with everything. That doesn't matter anymore. Because as of yesterday, I no longer work at Garland Creek. She fired you? But you've been there since the beginning. I'll be okay. Your father took care of me, I invested well. I've always wanted to try something new, and now I have the chance. What if I can get to the safe? I would say that you were asking for trouble. Don't mess with Veronica. She has a lot of powerful friends in this city. She would do anything to protect her precious reputation. Simone. Go home. Live your life. I don't have much of a life to go home to. All I need is the combination. [playing gentle melody] Hey. Ash, I'm so sorry I'm late. Don't worry about it. Okay. Sorry. You know... [sighs] ...this thing would really work better around your neck. Thanks, Mom. I took it off for physical therapy. [quietly]: Okay. So, you're writing again? The phrasing is clunky, and the progression in the pre-chorus doesn't work. Well, I think it sounded great so far. Do me a favor, okay? Don't tell my mom. I don't know what this is yet. My lips are sealed. So, um, was this inspired by you and the valet? Come on. It's all over Twitter. What happened? I-I went for a ride with Beau, and... Wait. Beau the bodyguard? And we started talking, and it... just felt like the right thing to do. I-I mean, that's great. So, uh, what else did you and Beau discuss? Stop it.[chuckles] What? He's really cute. Hadn't noticed.Right. If you say so. Besides, look at me. Who would want to deal with all this anyway? Ash. You know what? It's a nice day. I'm gonna go write outside. Okay. [door opens][sighs] [piano playing gentle melody] To the happy couple. OTHERS: Cheers. LORRAINE: Mmm. [exhales] We are just so pleased you were able to make time for us. Ah. It's so nice to meet both of you. I'm so sorry that we had to keep putting this off. Oh, we completely understand. It's horrifying what your family has endured. Having to witness your child suffer like that. M-Mom. Lorraine.I was just letting Rebecca know that we're praying for them. EVERETT: Maddie. Tucker tells us you're making quite an impression at your firm. Well, I don't know about that. Oh, she's a star. She's on track to becoming the youngest partner in firm history. EVERETT: That's fantastic. And a testament to your hard work. Thank you. LORRAINE: Oh, it's so nice to have career stability. Well, the best part of my day is coming home and reading Tucker's pages. I don't want to spoil anything, but believe me, his next book is gonna be incredible. LORRAINE: Well, let's just hope more people read this one. [knock on door, door opens] Hey. I was gonna go work out back, but I know I'm not allowed outside without supervision, so... Yeah, uh, Jeff's covering, so I'll let him know. Okay. Got it. Ashley, wait. Look, I just, I think it's best if we keep things professional, you know? Is that what your dad wants? It's what my boss wants. I get it. Don't worry about it, really. Jeff, she'll be out back a while. [clattering] You really should lock your door. I thought I did. You came back. And you're cleaning my apartment. Somebody had to-- this place is a dump. By the way, I think you have a mouse. I don't bother him, he doesn't bother me. I have food if you're hungry. [laughs softly] I don't think anybody's ever cooked for me before. They still haven't-- I picked up takeout. Turkey sandwiches and pumpkin pie. How'd you know I like pumpkin pie? I didn't. I like it. You're just one surprise after another. I wasn't even sure if I was gonna see you again. It's been a strange few days. You want to talk about it? I'd rather eat. [phone buzzing] Gwen. Thank you for getting back to me. Okay, um, I'll check it now. BEAU: Ashley, can I speak with you a moment? I don't know. Wouldn't want to violate protocol. It's about your attack. Do you recognize him? He's the doctor from the hospital. The one who tried to take your photo. Have you seen him anywhere else?I... I don't...His name's Kyle Verafield. He's a grad student at Vandy. ASHLEY: I-I... I-I don't know. Oh, my God. What is it? No, that's-that's Kyle. You know him? How? Uh... I-I went out with him last night. ASHLEY: What? No... No, no. No fucking way. Okay. Tell me how you met him. I just ran into him on the street. Susie, what did he say about me? What did you say? Nothing. Nothing. You-you barely came up. Goddamn it, Susie. It's okay. No. No, it's not okay. What the fuck were you thinking? LORRAINE: Oh, I have a little something for you. Ugh, that is so sweet, Lorraine. Mom, you didn't have to.LORRAINE: Oh. It's your something old, new, borrowed, blue, all in one. Oh, my gosh. That is so lovely. REBECCA: Hmm. How very thoughtful of you.I... ...I used the flowers from Anna's blanket. It'll be like she's right there with us. Who's Anna? You never told her? Told me what? EVERETT: I told you this would happen.TUCKER: It's not her fault. It's no one's fault. Tucker? I can't do this right now. Are you leaving? I'm sorry. [guitar playing bluesy tune] You're pretty good at that, you know. My dad was lead for some of the greats, like George Strait, Alabama, Bonnie Raitt. And I was just always there, watching and learning. How about you? You got any hidden talents? None worth mentioning. Sharing, it's something that people do sometimes. Why? You know I'm not staying. Well, then, it doesn't matter, does it? Might as well talk. Fine. You want to know something, ask away. Why'd you come back today? And don't say it's just 'cause I'm good in bed. Yes, that. And I had a really nice time last night. Okay, so now you ask me a question. You see how this works?[groans] Okay, uh, how was your day today? Whoa, okay. Hard-hitting questions here.Mm. Um, I auditioned for a gig, didn't get it. But... I did manage to shower without getting my chest wet. Who areyou? You're like this troubled bad boy, but then you're super nice. It's weird. I'm not that nice. Tell me more. Nope. You don't get my secrets until I get yours. [groans] I decked my stepbrother.[chuckles] [giggles]Well, that explains that. Mmm.I take it he had it coming. Oh, a long time coming. I think he's helping my stepmother try to steal my dad's company. Oh, that's some serious shit. Is it a company in town? Ever heard of Garland Creek? Your dad's Frank Garland?[chuckling]: Yeah. Oh. That whiskey and I go way back. So why do you think your family is trying to shut you out in the first place? Call it a personality clash. Why is it so hard for you to open up? [pouring liquid] [sets bottle on table] I have a hard time letting people in. But you do show up and clean their apartments. I run from people. Especially the good ones. But for some reason, I can't get you out of my head. And I really wish I could. Well... ...your secret's safe with me. Mm?I have some things I need to take care of. Oh, like family things? Need a ride? Yeah. Okay, it looks like those photographers have finally gone home. How's it looking in there? [football game playing on phone]All clear. [football game playing on phone] [announcer speaks indistinctly] Ooh... [exhales] [grunts] We're really doing this? We're really doing this. I thought you were cool.I am cool. Very cool. So what, you still have keys to this place after all this time? Yeah. Oh. You're sure there's not an alarm? Not on this door. [lock clicks] But there is a security guard. Lock the door. Wow. [chuckles]Don't touch that. What if I'm thirsty? That's Grand Reserve. One of only five in the world. Worth close to a hundred grand. It's not what we came for. [latch clicks, hinge creaks] Oh. [Jackson chuckles] [dial clicking] [footsteps nearby] You almost done? I think I just heard some footsteps. Just a few more seconds. You find something?No, I... I don't know. Running out of time.Okay, okay. [pounding on door]MAN: Who's in there? Open up!What do we do? [doorknob rattling]Follow my lead. What?Oh, God. [whispers] [lock clicks] You're trespassing on private property. Simone. Hi, Malcolm. Long time no see. What are you doing here? You know how much I loved my dad. Figured I'd take one last trip down memory lane before I go. Yeah. Ooh. That's the story you're sticking with? Can you blame us? We'll put it back and be on our way. No harm, no foul.Yeah. But I'm sorry, Simone. I can't let you do that. [screams] [footsteps approaching] [exhales] What's wrong? Not now. I need sleep. What are you doing? YOUNG TUCKER: I can't sleep. [thunder rumbling] [thunder crashing] I can't sleep. That's okay. You can sleep here. ANNA: You can sleep here. No, you don't, you don't have to do that. I told you everything about Luke. I know you did. Please don't. No! [screaming]: No! No! No! [quietly]: I don't have a choice. [sighs] I hope that's not too tight. Sorry this had to happen. You're the only way I could get to her. Ah, ah, ah.[panting] I'm not a violent person, Susie. But this is a unique situation that just might call for it. [shuddering sobs] Did they take anything? Well, they tried to steal Frank's Grand Reserve. But I got them in time. VERONICA: Good work. Give us a minute.Yes, ma'am. [door closes]You're too good to accept my money, but you're gonna try and steal from your dead father? That offer was almost as pathetic as sending Ron to make it. And who are you? Jackson, ma'am. Were you in on this?You don't have to answer. I'm just here for the booze. Oh. [chuckling]: Yes. Good times and booze are Simone's specialty. Bet you don't know what happens when the good times end? Who says they have to end? Oh, you must not know her very well. I bet you're just dying to tell him.[Veronica chuckles] You see, our darling Simone here is a criminal. Check fraud, identity theft; I'm sure there's more. Remind me. You were in prison for three years? I might be a criminal, but at least I'm not a murderer. [sighs] Not that again. I know you killed him. VERONICA: I would tread lightly if I were you. I am a well respected member in the community, grieving the loss of my husband. [scoffs]You're an ex-con. I could call the cops, or your parole officer and watch them haul your sorry ass back to North Carolina. But I'm feeling charitable. I will forget all of this; if you promise to leave Nashville today. You don't have to promise her shit. VERONICA: What's it gonna be? What's it going to be? I'll leave. VERONICA: Great. Don't make me regret my kindness. Either of you. Malcolm will escort you out. [door opens, closes] [water splashing in fountain] [muffled yelling] It's really you. Please... don't make a sound. I don't want to hurt her. [exhaling] There are people in the house. I took care of that. They won't bother us. What do you want? ♪ You ♪ I want you. I remember you. From the hospital. I was one of your first YouTube subscribers. I've been to all your live performances. Every single concert. Of course. Yeah. I remember.I knew you would. You... you came into my life when I needed you most. My mom was dying. All my friends pushed me away. No one understood. But... but when I saw you, I knew... I... I-I knew I-I wasn't alone. Ashley! You think you need this? [shrieks] Ashley, I would never hurt you. You have to believe me. I... I did all this so that you would want me after what happened to you. They couldn't protect you, but I can. You have to come with me. Okay, okay. Yeah, I'll come with you. [chuckles]Leave her here, and I... and I'll go. [muffled]: No. Ash. Ash. Ash, no! Ashley! [grunts] Ash! Ashley! [shouts] [grunts] [screams] Are you okay? Why are you fighting me? [screaming] Jeff, what was that? Jeff? We have a home invasion and active assailant at 47 Harcourt Lane. I need all available units now. [whimpering] [quietly]: I know this is difficult, but I'll never give up on you. [muffled cries] [grunts] Stay back! [shouting, crying] [muffled shout] He's got her. Go. [Ashley whimpers][Kyle screaming] [yelling, shouting] [gunshots] [screaming] [sobbing] Hey. [sobbing] [sobbing continues, muffled through water] You okay? These were my parents' wedding rings. Were they happy? Too happy. Never lasts. Well, your dad hung onto them this long, it must've meant something to him. I think he didn't want your stepmother to have them. Everything Veronica said about me is true. Simone, you don't have to. I got caught up with a lot of the wrong people. Wrong men. I made a lot of bad choices. Do you think I give a shit about that? We've all done things we're not proud of.Some more than most. Let's see what's on this thing. What're we hoping to find? Financial records, original copy of my dad's trust. Basically anything that proves Veronica is a liar. What's that? Uh, I think this is a P.I. firm in town. That's not your dad, is it? No, it is not. Okay. This doesn't prove that she killed him. No, but it does prove she's not the grieving widow. [siren wails, chirps] [indistinct radio chatter] All right, one, two, three. [indistinct conversations] REBECCA: Hey, honey.Mom. I leave for one day... Yeah, um, Ashley fought back. She saved Susie. Managed to get him all the way out here, and, uh... ...I got a clean shot. You did good. I'm gonna check on Jeff. You okay out here? Yeah. [sighs] Ashley, I'm so sorry.It's okay. How are you? Are you okay? He could've killed you. But he didn't. I am just so glad that you are safe. [sniffles] [sighs] [crying] [crickets chirping] [cell phone buzzing] Tucker? You home? [lock clicks] Tucker? Hey, Tucker?[knocking] Hey. Hey. We need to talk. Yeah. I know. You had a sister? A twin. Anna was my other half. She was six minutes older than. [chuckles] And she never let me forget it. She was a lot tougher than me. She led, I followed. That's just the way it went. What happened to her? YOUNG TUCKER: Wait up, Anna. TUCKER: My granddad, he, uh, left me this cabin. We used to come out here every summer. We weren't allowed in the lake alone, but, uh, we'd play on this dock anyway. I don't know how she fell in. All I heard was the splash. -[water splashes] -Anna? Anna, where are you? Anna! I jumped in after her. You were a kid. It was just an accident. I should've told you. Her death changed us. My father shut down. My mother started drinking. I struggled, too. It was impossible for me to talk about her, but not with writing. I could keep her alive in my heart, in my mind. There's a piece of her in everything I do. How do you stay in this house, surrounded by all of those memories? I know it's hard to understand, but when I'm out here, it's like she's still here with me. Okay. You should be all set for tonight. I've personally triple checked everything. Thought you would've packed up and gone home by now. We'll be reassessing your security needs in the morning, but for now, you're stuck with me. There are worse people to be stuck with. [chuckles] Do you ever get used to it? To what? Seeing someone die. I hope not. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel. Thank you for saving me. You did that for yourself. Really, you were... something. I've been thinking of our conversation, not being professional. Uh...And I've realized... ...professional is overrated. [sighs]
