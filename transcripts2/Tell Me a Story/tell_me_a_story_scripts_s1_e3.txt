 Money laundering, racketeering. Dan Simmons' body was discovered earlier this afternoon. Someone moved his body. Who? Why would they do that? You're all I want. We... are the best part of me. You're all I want. Please marry me, Jordan Evans. We are the best part of me. Everybody on the floor now! Put your gun down! ♪ Crazy ♪ I'm crazy for feeling ♪ So lonely ♪ Crazy ♪ I'm crazy for feeling ♪ So lonely... I may not have known Beth Miller, but I wish I had. Speaking with her loved ones, they shared with me stories of a woman who dedicated her life to helping others, to making the world a better place... I think I found you a new client. Do you remember Matt from Bagram? Well, he asked how much you charge per hour and I told him you give vets a discount, so he's gonna be giving you a call. Matt with the weird tattoos? Yeah. I need some rich clients, Terry. Well, I cannot help you there. Two people dead near Downtown just this week. The police have yet to release any further information at this time but are confident they will find the three men responsible and bring some closure for the families of the victims. Hannah, what's going on with you? No, it's just my brother Gabe. He's staying with me. He's gotten into some... trouble. It's got me a little screwy. Okay. Over there. Hannah. Hannah. I'm good. All good. Hey. Where's Dad? He left early. Um, did he leave my...? Leave your phone? Yes, he did. Uh, he said that I could give it back to you. Great. But I have decided to hold on to it. Why? What for? Insurance policy. That's bullshit. Everything is on that phone. My entire life. That is the most depressing thing I've ever heard. Oh, come on. You know, I thought you wanted to be the cool grandmother. I never said that. And, uh, I'm okay with being uncool. In fact, I'm okay with being mean. I'm really good at it. So, here's the deal. After school, you are going to meet me at the shop and do a little free labor. Now, where's my card with the address? Forget it. Oh, this is nonnegotiable. And do not test me, Kayla. You will not win. This is so fucked up. Isn't it? Hey. How many times I got to tell you? Your brother's not welcome here. Yeah, I got it, Joe. You know you're not supposed to be here. Joe's ready to shit bricks. Oh, fuck Joe. He's not my father-in-law. What's wrong with you? I'm freaking out, Mitch, all right? Between the cops on my ass and this guy following me... No one is following you. I saw him. He was in the club last night. Maybe he is following you. So what? The guy knows less than the police do. He can't do anything. Listen, I'm telling you, Eddie, you're being paranoid. I've seen you like this before. I need my money, okay? You know I owe people, and it's time to pay. Your dealer? How much do you owe? I'll front you. 20 grand. Jesus Christ. Eddie. I don't got that kind of money. We got to talk to Sam. We should've been paid by now. I called him. He hasn't called me back. See? Something's wrong. - Let's go talk to him. - Mitch. Back to work. All right, we'll go tonight. Get the fuck out of here. You're back. To get a few things. So, you're... living with your sister now? Just away from you. I don't know why you're blaming me. You did the same thing. I didn't leave you. No, but you left Dan on the floor, dead, just like I did. You're no better than me. You're just slower. Fuck you. Nobody cares. Come on. We're in the clear. It was... one big accident. Let it go. I'll be back for the rest of my things. What-the-fuck-ever. There was that time in the Catskills, remember? Beth convinced us to go skinny-dipping. How she got us in that freezing water, I still don't know. Beth... she could charm anyone. Even the cop that showed up. Yeah. By the time the officer left, he had ripped up the citation and was asking Beth for tips on conflict resolution. Your parents looked great. I haven't seen them in so long. Not since they moved to Denver. I'm gonna take them to the airport in the morning. I went in for a voice lineup. I identified one of the pigs. So it's only a matter of time before they find the other two. No. Guy had an alibi. They said I was wrong. Did they check out his alibi? So they say. Mm. They'll find the guys. They always find them. Only 62% of all murder cases in the United States are solved. Only 31% in New York City. You hungry? Need something to eat? Yeah, we can make you a plate. Food? Is that the answer? No. No, goddamn it, I'm not hungry. I'm sorry. Sorry, it's just... been a very long day. Thank you all for coming. Really. But I-I think I'd like to be alone for a little while. Yeah. Of course. We'll help you clean up a little bit. Hey. The, um... the restaurant's in good hands. You need anything else... I found him. Who? The guy. The pig. After the lineup, I followed him to his job. To his trailer in Queens. I know where he lives. So, about the other night... Very lame of you, bailing on us like that. Things were just getting interesting. Yeah, well, I'm sure you and Laney found a way to keep yourselves entertained. Yeah, but I was thinking about you the entire time. Because that's not creepy. Seriously. Things were just getting three-way steamy and you take off? So, you Oakland chicks too cool to answer your texts? No, it's not like that. My dad lost his shit because of our little impromptu and took my phone. That is such an antiquated form of punishment. Your phone is a necessity. A breathing apparatus. An extension of your hand. A sixth finger. Yeah, I have to work after school now. Where? My grandmother owns a costume shop. Who is this woman and what does she have against Jacuzzi sex? Do you mind? What? Kayla was there, too, remember? For some of it, anyway. Why are we here? I haven't heard anything. Not since they found Simmons' body in the Hudson. I've been watching the news, reading the police blogs. That's a good thing, though, isn't it? Doesn't it bug you? Someone came to that room after we left and moved his body. But if it means that it's over, then why should we care? Oh. Dan Simmons' cell phone. I want to turn it on. You said we couldn't, that someone could trace it. I want to know who moved his body and why. Probably be locked. It's a burner phone. Jesus, Hannah, what are you doing? Shh. Hang up. Uh... hey. Hello. Okay, let's cut the shit. I know about Dan. Who is this? Yeah, okay, let's start again. I don't give a shit about Dan. I just want what's owed me. So whoever this is, just so we're clear, I am not someone to be fucked with! You feel better now? 'Cause that was fucking crazy. He said he was owed. I found this... in Dan's wallet. What is it? You see the emblem and number on it? I looked it up. It's a storage place. Oh, hell no. Don't even think about it. Why not? We have the key. Yeah, and he, they, whoever, they probably know that. It could be a setup. And what if it's not? This could be leverage. A way for us to protect ourselves. Or get ourselves killed. What is wrong with you? Aren't you curious? We need to know what we're dealing with here. No. I-I just want this to go away. I am trying to figure this out, Gabe. I am trying to protect you. Let's check it out. I killed a man, Hannah. Me. I did it. I am not gonna steal from him, too. I never should have called you. Nick. Hey, Nick, wait up. I... Not... not a good idea, please. To walk down a street? Don't play dumb, please. There's two, maybe three feet between us. You're my teacher. We don't have to ignore each other just 'cause we're not in a classroom. Yes, I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just a... little uptight. How are you doing? You mean since the other night when I puked up my sad life all over your apartment? Yeah, I'm a little embarrassed, I won't lie. No, no, I-it's okay. I... I'm glad you did. It's just, I've never really talked about my mom before. Okay? Not like that. It's a big deal, Kayla. You're allowed to not be over it. Yeah. I-I do have to say it was good for me, too. It allowed... allowed us to reset and redefine the boundary of you and me. Uh, yeah: you teacher, me student. Quick learner, yes. Um, a substitute teacher isn't permanent. Yeah, I am aware of that, but I would like to land a permanent job. So you're all in. Teaching's your thing. She says with disdain. I didn't mean it like that. Nah, it's all right. My mother would agree. Well, she's right. It's a shit job. Pays bad. Total loser career. Yes. Yes, but it allows me to write, so... Oh, a writer! See, that works. Much sexier way to starve. Stop. What? Flirting. I'm not. You... No, you're reading into it. I'm just being me. I come this way. Um... okay, now, listen, you need to go that way. I'm glad you're doing okay. I will see you in class. Later, loser. Uh, this was, like... ♪ Oh, you showed up. I'm impressed. You have my phone. Okay, this is way cool. Very gypsy bohemian. Oh, don't label me. I hate labels. I think of it as... timeless chic. I'm pretty sure that's a label. Come on. I'll give you the tour. We're a costume rental house. We do Broadway and off Broadway. We do film, we do television. But our bread and butter, that's all online. Wow. This place is all yours? Yeah. Your grandfather and I bought it together. Dad said you opened this place when your dancing career failed. Your dad doesn't know shit. I quit dancing because I got knocked up. It's like my parents. Your dad told you that? I overhead it in one of their fights. Did they fight often? Got pretty bad sometimes. My, uh, my dad can be pretty uptight. You know? Well, of course you do. You raised him. Oh, that uptight has nothing to do with me. His short temper, all of that, those traits, they came from your grandfather. I, on the other hand, am perfect. He was a real hottie. He was, wasn't he? Dad said he died of a heart attack. Yeah. Oh, God, that was... that was ten years ago this January. ♪ Does it still hurt? Well, sometimes, when you have a... a sad day or a moment. Anyway, I'm gonna put you to work. Oh, I have got to go to FedEx, and I have forwarded all the calls here to my cell. What, you're just gonna leave me here alone? Against all reason... I'm trusting you. What... what if a-a customer comes in? Oh, it's a slow day today. But if you need me, call me. I'm a block away. ♪ You can't go back there. I cannot stress that enough. What if this guy leads me to the others? I have to find the man who killed Beth. I owe her that. And then what? The world... is angry. So much hate and rage. Beth saw that. But I couldn't. I didn't want to. Listen to me. You can't take this on yourself. What if it was Abby? What if she hadn't died in a car accident? What if someone had shot her point-blank? That's not fair. Fair? When was the last time that word meant anything? You need... to let the police handle this. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Colleen? Hello? Colleen? Colleen? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me. Ow, that really hurt. What are you doing here? Wow, you're really uptight. Good news is I can fix that. How did you know where to find me? Well, you said your grandma had a costume shop. Google last name Powell, costume shop, LinkedIn, small business owner... do I need to finish this question? And does Laney know you're here? Laney doesn't own me. We're not a thing. We just hang out sometimes. Yeah, well, Laney likes you. And I like you. It's like we're a triangle on one of those teen shows on that network I don't watch. In dramatic terms, it's what's known as a trope. You need to go now. Look... I appreciate the whole "hos before bros" loyalty, but... Laney's just Laney. But you... you're special. Oh, look, the door. Look, I'm not a bad guy, Kayla. You just act like one. See? You get me. Look, I'll be your friend, Ethan, but that's it. This really is one of those teen shows. This is not some triangle. I'm talking about the part where you're fucking the teacher. Oops. Another trope. I don't know what you're talking about. Nice try. Laney told me everything. You two getting high at the club. Your night of hot sex with Mr. Sullivan. Laney doesn't know shit. I wonder what happens to a teacher who sleeps with their students these days. It's such a flagrant abuse of power. Good-bye, Ethan. Well, great chat. Lovely store. I know where to come for Halloween. I'm off. Later, sexy. ♪ It's looking good there, little man. No, it's not. It's crooked. Hey, hey, hey, take your time. Don't be in such a hurry, all right? I know it's hard work, but it'll pay off. Hard work always pays off. Try it again. Hey, it's, uh, it's almost dinnertime, so why don't you get washed up, we'll finish this later, okay? Okay.Hey. Pay the toll. Love you. Love you, too. Marianna, I have an errand to run. I'll be back in a few. Okay. What the fuck are you doing here? We got to talk. Mitch, this your idea? Just wondering what the deal is. Cops brought me in, Sam. They're on to me. Nah. They're not on to you, they're just fishing. So, y-you know something? I asked around. They got nothing, so calm the fuck down. Where's our money? I'm still waiting on the buyer. All right, then you got to front me the money. I need some money. I owe people. This is my problem? Hey, Sam, look. We're not here to gripe, man. You know, y-you ain't been calling me back, so... we're just worried, that's it. You're the one who killed those people. Not us... you. I'm not going down for that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't threaten me. Hey, enough! Aah! My arm! My fucking arm. Okay. Easy. Easy. Don't move. Don't do it. You'll get your money when I get mine. If you two ever come back here, yes, I will kill you. In a statement made by the New York City Police, the three suspects in the Downtown robbery-homicide are still at large and have yet to be brought in. The police are encouraging any eyewitnesses from around the jewelry store that day to step forward to aid in the investigation. Two people dead near Downtown... Hi, Detective Garcia. This is Jordan Evans. I was calling to see if there had been any new information. If you could call me back. Detective, this is Jordan Evans. I was calling to see if there had been any new information. If you could please call me back. Please. Detective Garcia, I-I-I-I know I just... I want you to know that I know that you're sending my calls to voice mail. I'm not stupid. You had me stand in a lineup.

What the hell is wrong with you? You're gonna need to be more specific. You swore that you wouldn't say anything about Nick. I didn't. I wouldn't. Well, then how the hell does Ethan know? I'm sorry, Kayla, it was the pot. Loose lips. What did he do? He came to my grandmother's shop and started talking shit about me and Nick. He came to her shop? Why would he do that? Why do you think? He's a guy. That piece of shit. Laney, this could ruin Nick's career. Don't worry. I got you. What are you doing? You fucking asshole. Dipshit. I told you that in confidence. Whoa! Hey! Hey! And you couldn't keep your mouth shut! What the hell, Laney? Stop. Stop. What's the big deal? Stop it. He's not even worth it. It's very sweet. But your loyalty's wasting on Laney. You should have seen the shit she was talking about you. Hands off. Hands off. Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here? What's going on here? Want to tell everybody, Mr. Substitute Teacher? Ethan.

Come on. If you need anything, I can... No, thank you. Please tell me that had nothing to do with us. I'm-I'm sorry, Nick. I'm so sorry. I... Fuck. I didn't think I'd see you back here. My options are limited. You or Billy. One's a dick and the other one's a dick. I... I don't want to fight with you, Gabe. I-I know. I know. And, um, I'm sorry for being such a bitch earlier. No, it's okay. What is that? My first count was $2 million. It's not too late. You can still take that back. Hear me out. Hannah. Hannah. The money isn't ours. I know. It belongs to Dan Simmons, a piece of shit ex-con, who is now dead. It's not Dan's money, you know that. More bad people. Who will want it back. That's why we need to leave the city. No. No. How do you know we weren't supposed to find this money? Maybe it's finally our turn. The world finally giving something back to us. It doesn't work that way. Well, it's time it should. We have been starving our whole lives, and you know it. You are six years old when Mom abandons us. Dad dies of some fucking rare cancer no one's ever heard of. Let's take the money as a gift for every bad thing that's ever happened. And go. Where? Wherever we want. We write our own story. Let's just pack up and go. Who the fuck cares?
