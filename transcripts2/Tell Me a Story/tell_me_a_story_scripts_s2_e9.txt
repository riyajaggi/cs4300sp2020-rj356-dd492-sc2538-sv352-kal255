 Previously on Tell Me a Story... I want to perform again. We're doing this. Just me and my guitar. I can't let you do this. It's not safe. I'm a performer. I'll never truly be safe. Nashville PD wants me back. I would never leave you unless I knew you were safe and in good hands. Ashley! Ashley, where you at? You do not come into this house screaming. Just let me leave! Then you'll never have to see me again.

 First-timer? I wish. Welcome back. What is she doing here? We're family. Sit. You know I'm not buying your act. The good stepmother. Oh, it's okay. I'm not buying the good stepdaughter one, either. I know about the affair. Cora knew about it, too. She was murdered because she had photos of the two of you. You changed the trust. Tomorrow, I want the original copy. If not, I go public. Please, call me Rachel.

 Maddie. It's nice to meet you. What's going on? It's Brendan. I haven't heard from him in two days. I'm gonna find Tucker, and I will call you as soon as I hear anything, okay? Tucker, we need to talk. My name isn't Rachel. It's Olivia. Where's Tucker? I'll tell you where he is. But first, I should tell you who he is. What the fuck is happening? I know how you feel. Your world spinning. It's the same as I felt when Tucker abducted me. This is Tucker's. It's a sedative. He uses it to incapacitate his victims. I was right outside my house when he jammed it into my neck. Why are you doing this? What the fuck was that? That... is Tucker. Take me to him. Now. He's down here. First door on the left. You go first. I'm not afraid to use this. Maddie? Maddie? Get out of here now! Maddie? No. No! No. What have you done?! Maddie, wake up. Honey, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake... You really shouldn't have come here. Pupils are slightly dilated. You're lucky to be alive. Let's take you to the hospital and get you checked out. No, that's not gonna be necessary. Mr. Morris, you were hit by a moving vehicle. It's likely that you have a concussion. Yeah, don't bother trying to talk any sense into this guy. He's the most stubborn man on the planet. Hey. Hi. You got horseshoes up your ass, you know that? Just a hard head. Any luck tracking down that car? No. We ran the partial you gave us. Yeah? Plates were stolen. Oh, fuck. This wasn't a random hit-and-run, Beau. Person who sent you that threat just tried to kill you. We don't know that for sure. I've more than my share of enemies these days. You don't think the timing's a bit suspicious? I'm just saying I'm not ruling anything out. And I'm saying you need to go home and get some rest. But first, you need to convince Ashley to cancel the concert. It's too dangerous. I can't. It's not my call. Well, then, I hope you have one hell of a plan to keep her safe, because this person is not going to stop. Oh, wow, speaking at a meeting. It has been a while. Be honest. How bad was I? I thought you were great. Really? Yeah. I mean, I love that you compared life to a one-four-five chord progression. Stuff was just coming out. Not even sure what I said. Well, at least this time, it wasn't the drinking that did it. Hey, Donna, thank you. For what? For making me feel welcome. Maybe don't thank me just yet. I knew who you were before we started to talk. I knew your father. That figures. All right, so how much did he owe you? No. Not like that. Truth is... is I owe him. More than I can say. Which is why I was wondering if you were looking for a sponsor. 'Cause I'd be happy to be yours if you want. Yeah, sure. That'd be great. Yeah? Yeah. All right. Give me your phone, music man. Oh. Here. Now, don't you go abusing this, all right? I don't want you calling me looking for a date. You hear me? Yes, ma'am. Geez, something's happening. I mean, I heard the sirens during the meeting. Oh. Says here that some big deal lawyer fell off a building downtown. Clay Callaway. What, you know him? Uh, not exactly. Thank you. We'll be in touch. Okay. Should be aware of tomorrow morning's commute. Unexpected street closures may cause longer than usual transportation time due to a shocking event. Tragedy struck downtown Nashville earlier tonight when prominent local lawyer Clay Callaway fell from the 28th floor of his office building. Authorities have yet to rule out foul play and are asking for anyone with information to contact them. Callaway was the managing partner of his firm, Callaway, Crawford and Fenning, and is survived by his wife and two daughters. Thank God you're okay. Maddie. Maddie. Maddie. Hey, hey. I know you're scared, but I'm gonna take care of you. Don't. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Everything she said was true. No, you can't believe a word she's saying. She's a... She's a liar. Did you rape her? No! No, of course not. Maddie, I know you have a lot of questions, but we just need to focus on getting you out of here. Don't you fucking touch me! Maddie! Listen to me! Hey! I am not the one you need to be afraid of. Please. Morning. Olivia, let Maddie go. She has nothing to do with this. This is between me and you. Before we begin, you should know that I used your phone to text your mother. I told her that you two needed some time alone. She wishes you luck. Olivia, listen to me. I am so sorry for what you've been put through. I had no idea what Tucker was doing here. I can tell. You really didn't know him, did you? We'll get to that. No, you don't understand. I'm on your side. You do not have to do this. You're wasting your breath. She doesn't care. What do you want? Think of this as therapy. It's a chance for me to learn about you and for you to learn about each other. All I ask is that you're honest. Or what? You first. Maddie wants to know. Where's Brendan? Tucker. Answer her. Where is Brendan? Dead. - Brendan's dead. - How? Did you kill him? No. Olivia's the one who killed him. What did I say? - Tell the truth. - I am. If it weren't for you, Brendan would still be alive. You're lying. I'm not. And if you think I am, why don't you come over here and do something about it? You should have kept both of my hands chained up, because if you get anywhere near me or Maddie, I will fucking kill you. And you tell yourself you're not a monster. Mrs. Garland, I'm Detective Roberts. This is Detective Chapman. Can we have a word with you? About what? We'd like to talk to you about Clay Callaway. We have some questions for you and your family. Mom, what is it? Get your brother and meet me in my office. I can't believe it. I... I had a meeting with him yesterday, and he was fine. Mrs. Garland, your relationship with Mr. Callaway was not strictly professional, isn't that right? You must admit, the timing is troubling. Your husband, then your business manager, Cora. Now Clay? All three dead? Why would I want Clay dead? Well, one theory is you wanted to control your husband's business. Once you achieved that, you had to tie up loose ends. Is that your theory or my stepdaughter's? I'm tired of this. All right? Simone has been making up lies about us ever since she got back. My son's right. With Simone's questionable past, I would think you'd want to talk to her. She is absolutely a person of interest. We know she had an appointment scheduled with Mr. Callaway shortly before he fell. Then why are you here? Why aren't you out looking for Simone? We put out an APB. But I was told she currently resides here. Simone never came home last night. So you haven't heard from her since yesterday? No, ma'am. But if she contacts us, we'll let you know. If there's nothing else? Just one last question. Where were you last night? I was home. We all were. Isn't that right, boys? The whole night. We were right here. Well, that's good to know. We'll be in touch. I hope they find Simone soon and lock that bitch up for good. Song & Stylemagazine will be asking the majority of the questions. I also invited a couple of local news outlets to join us. And they'll stick with the approved questions? If they don't, I'll show them the door. Don't worry, Mom. I got this. They're waiting for you in the living room. We can get started now. Ashley, mind if I take some stills? Yes. Of course. I want my fans to see me as I really am. Ashley, it's only been a few months since the bombing that almost took your life. Why return to the stage so quickly? So few of us are lucky enough to do something we love. For me, performing is like coming home. I can't wait to get back out there. What can you tell us about the show tomorrow? Going back to the basics. Intimate. Unplugged. Not what fans have come to expect from an Ashley Rose concert. Well, this is a new side of me. These last few months, I've been through a lot. It's changed me. I hope my fans understand that. Rumor has it you've been working on some new material? Yes. A new song. During my recovery, I read a good deal about other burn survivors. Their stories inspired me to write about my own journey. It's been the hardest thing I've ever written. But also the most rewarding. I really wanted to dig deep and look inside myself. Complete honesty. Ashley, after your last performance, your car being blown up, I have to ask, do you fear for your safety getting back onstage again? Being in the public eye, there's always gonna be people who hate you, wish you harm. But I can't let them chase me away. I'm surrounded by the best security team there is. With them, I don't have to be afraid. I can concentrate on the music, trust them to keep me safe. 911. What's your emergency? Hi. Yeah, I'm calling about a hit-and-run last night. I'm sure I'm just being paranoid, but I saw one of my neighbors pull into his driveway and his windshield was all messed up. Okay. Please hold. Yes, I'll hold. Don't worry. I'm alone. Thanks for coming. I know how it looks, but I didn't kill Clay. Simone... I went to his office. I wanted him to come clean about Veronica. We talked, and then I left. I was halfway to my car when I saw him fall. I believe you. I do. But how can you be sure that Clay didn't jump? I'm almost certain someone followed me there. I keep thinking, your mom doesn't like getting her hands dirty, but Ron does. He's always hated me, and now this is his chance to get rid of me. But I don't have any proof. What aren't you telling me? Derek, you came here for a reason. What is it? What do you know? I lied. To you. To the cops. The night Cora died, Ron wasn't with me. I don't know where he was. I don't understand. Ron treats you like shit. Why do you keep covering for him? He's family. How many more people are you gonna let him hurt? You're right. We should go to the cops, tell 'em what we know and that I lied. It will still be his word against ours. What I need is proof, something I can take to the cops that proves Ron was behind it all. Then this can finally be over. We can go back to our normal lives. You really think that's possible? I do. But I can't do it alone. Will you help me? We need to talk. In case you've forgotten, I have a business to run. We'll talk later. Look, you can't ignore this. Clay's a big deal in town, and the cops aren't gonna let this go. I'm sure they'll find Simone soon. And what if they don't? Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night, and I could have sworn I heard your car pull into the drive. That's bullshit. I was home all night. All I'm saying is, if you did something, if things got out of hand, you can tell me. You know I didn't kill Clay. Or anybody else. I want to believe that. But I've seen your temper, and I know what you did to Simone. Is that what you're gonna tell the cops if they come back asking more questions? Of course not. You're my son.Good. Because we both know that the wife is always a suspect. And so is the mistress. There's a lot that I could tell them about you, too. Is that a threat? Course not, Mom. It's just a reminder that we're both in this together. Hey, man. Mr. Pruitt. Jackson. Hi, Mom. I take it you're here to see Ashley? Believe it or not, I came to talk to you. About the other night. Why? Things never change between us. Maybe it could. You think I like this? Being at odds with you all the time? Mm. You think I hate you. You think I blame you. I don't. You don't get it. You're my favorite. Mothers aren't supposed to have favorites. But you're my firstborn, and that is special. I love you. And it kills me to see you suffer the way that you do. I went to a meeting last night. I got a sponsor. You've been to a lot of first meetings. And I am hopeful that you will make it to a second. Sorry. It's my sponsor. I got to go. It's gonna be different this time, Mom. Fuck! Maddie. Maddie, please. Look at me. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm gonna help us get out of here. Tucker, what the fuck is happening? I told you. Olivia killed Brendan. And then she kept me locked down here for days. That is bullshit! You abducted her. This is your house. The fucking chains. The soundproofing? It's not what you think. Then what is it? Oh, my God. Is this about your sister? Anna helped me sleep. I just... needed some sleep. How many other women did you do this to? Two. What? Two others. Did you kill them? Did you kill them? Look, Maddie, Maddie, listen. Don't fucking touch me! Listen, I know you... I know you hate me right now, but I love you. And I never lied to you about that. And I would never hurt you. But Olivia will. So right now, we just need to work together to try to get out of here. And you expect me to trust you? What other choice do you have? Hey. Hey. You okay? Uh, yeah. I'll be fine. Um, I just need you to do another sweep of the backyard. You got it. Thank you. Jeff, what was that I just saw? Jeff? Ashley. Help me! Help me! No. No, no, no. Save me, please! Beau! Beau! Oh. Oh. Oh. Uh... Hey, Gwen, this is, uh... It's not really a good time. You okay? No. No, I'm not. I'm starting to think that you were right. I... I don't think I can keep her safe. I... I think we need to cancel this concert. Or maybe not. We made an arrest. Who? How-how did you find them? We got a tip on the car that hit you. Patrol went to go check it out, and they caught the mother lode. Bombs, blueprints, you name it. Who was it? His name is Raymond Fisher. Textbook paranoid with a record for aggravated assault and battery. He was friends with Dylan Young. Dylan's girlfriend gave us his name as a possible suspect. What's his connection to Ashley? We're not sure yet, but there's evidence he was obsessed with Ashley... A lot of it. And has he confessed? Not yet, but Beau, it's over. I don't know how to thank you. I owe you. Thank you. Ashley, Ms. Pruitt. What happened to you? Are you okay? Oh, I'm fine. Listen, I just got off the phone with Detective Roberts and... they've made an arrest. Are you serious? I can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh... it's over. Oh. Oh. Here it is. Uh-oh. Oh, God, we were so young. How did you two meet? I don't know. One dive bar or another. We were all doing the same thing back then. Singing, drinking, repeat. It was a lot of fun, I'll tell you that. I mean, until it wasn't. What happened? I just got sick of singing backup. You know? It was looking like the spotlight was never gonna happen for me, so... I quit. But your dad was the one who found me in whatever woe-is-me drunken hole I'd buried myself in, and he pulled me out.Hmm. Convinced me to not give up on my dreams. I got sober for a hot minute, formed a band. We were good, too. Why'd you stop? I was a single mom, and I didn't want my kid to be raised in a bar like I was. Hmm. Wow. What? Every story I've ever heard about my dad usually ends with "that son of a bitch." I'm just not used to hearing good things about him. And you're the spitting image of him, you know that? Inside and out. Mm. Wait. Oh. Robbie may have had his demons and lost his way at times, but his heart was always in the right place. I got a feeling yours is, too. This is Simone. Leave a message. Hey, Simone. It's Jackson. I know you may not want to hear from me, but... you're not getting rid of me that easy. Got to be quick. What exactly are you looking for? Anything that could connect Ron to Clay or Cora's murder. Okay, you take upstairs. I'll keep watch down here in case anyone comes home. Thank you. Cora. Hello? Thought you were going out. Forgot my phone. Why the fuck do you care? I don't. Yo. Hey. Uh... I-I'm... I'm a little worried about Mom. It's too much... all of this stuff. Losing Dad and all the stuff going on with the cops. You know she's not here right now. You don't have to kiss her ass. Tucker, stop. Move over. Neither one of us are getting out of here without each other. When I say go, you pull. Okay?  All right. Pull! Uh, stop, stop, stop, stop. Oh, God. I know what we need to do. My hand is too big. So I need you to... break my thumb so I can slip free. God. You can do it. Just don't think about it. Come on. Grab my thumb. Hey. Just don't think about it. I can't!  You have to. You have to! Just do it! Damn it. Do it! I can't. Good news. I found the keys to your gun safe. Where were we? Celebrating, are we? It still doesn't feel real. I'm just glad that you're finally safe. Can I pour you a glass? Yeah. A small one. Still technically on duty. Just a few more days. Made your decision yet? About going back to the force? To be honest, I haven't really had much time to think about it. You always said you loved being a cop. Plus, I bet you look really hot in that uniform. I'll take it. You know, whatever happens, uh... I'm not going anywhere. You know that, right? It's good to hear. Cheers. Can I ask you something? Yeah. I would really like to take you on a proper date. Okay. What do you have in mind? I thought we could go for a stroll through the botanical gardens and maybe head back to my place for a homecooked meal. You cook? I do. Well, okay. What's your specialty? Uh, beef Bourguignon. Mm, French. Of course. For dessert? Well, I'm sure we could think of something. Down by two scores. 24 to 13. Hello? Hello? Who is that? Hey, brother. Ron. You're drunk. Go sleep it off, man. Where is everyone? Where's Mom? Haven't seen her. We got to talk. Now you want to talk. I fucked up bad, D. I should have never listened to Mom. But she made it seem so easy. All we had to do was change the trust. That's it. Now, all these people are dead, and I don't know what to do. And what the hell do you want from me? All this time, I thought it was Simone, and now I'm not sure. I think... I think Mom's trying to pin this shit on me. What is that? That's a screw from the air vent in my room. I think she was in there. Mom? Doing what? I don't fucking know, but I can't let this happen. You sound paranoid. Do you think she won't sell us both out the first chance she gets? Don't say that. It's fucking true! All she does is think about herself. And you're too blind to see it! Me and you, we can get ahead of this, all right? We can go to the cops and tell them what Mom's done with Frank's trust, and how she orchestrated all of this shit. You want to turn our own mother in to the cops? And what if you're wrong? I'm not. Now, are you with me or not? Hmm? Hmm?! You really shouldn't have threatened Mom. Where the fuck did you get a gun? I tried to stay out of it. I tried. But Frank said he was gonna leave Mom. He was gonna leave her with nothing. You killed Frank. I tried to reason with him. I wanted him to understand what he would do to Mom if he left. How badly he would destroy her. But he said he didn't care. Like you, he didn't give a shit what would happen to her. Just put the gun down, and you and I, we can-we can figure this out. I already have. What? You gonna shoot me? The cops will know it was you. No, they won't. Not if there's not a body. Once you disappear, the cops will just assume you did it and ran. You've always been such an asshole. Nobody will think twice. I know you. You're not gonna shoot me. You're gonna do exactly what I say. Now, give me the go... This is Chapman. I'm at 134 Lake View Lane. I've got a lead on Brendan Park. His wife reported him missing. I'm gonna take a closer look. Copy that, Detective. 10-4. Maddie... how does a smart, successful, beautiful attorney fall for this lying, manipulative psychopath? The brooding writer thing, was that too hard to resist? Just leave her alone. What about you? What makes her so special? Did you seriously never consider abducting her? No. Never. Why? She has dark hair, same as Anna. Same as me. Why not take her and spare me? Because she saved me. The day we met, in the park by the river... I was in a dark place. I hadn't slept in weeks. And I'd read that drowning was just like going to sleep. And then Maddie said hello. It was like she was the first person in a long time to really see me. And then she asked if I had ever seen such a beautiful day. It was not a beautiful day. It was cold, and it was overcast. But that's not how she saw it. And I knew right then that I wanted to see the world through her eyes. And I wanted what we had to be enough. But it never was. Because you need to control and dominate. I get it. It's who we are. I told you... you and I are nothing alike. I love Maddie. Not enough to stop killing. Be honest, Tucker, you're just like me. We're both trying to be normal. To have relationships and make them work. But they never do. Because we always end up in the same place. Putting ourselves first. If it came down to it, now that Maddie knows who you really are, would you let her live? We have company. For his sake, I wouldn't make any noise. Hey.Evening. Can I help you? I'm Detective Chapman. We're investigating a missing person. Is Mr. Reed at home? No. Unfortunately, he stepped out. Can I have him call you? Would you mind if I come in? No. Of course not. Come on in. Thank you. All right, Maddie, this is our chance. We have to get out of here. Okay, on the count of three, I want you to pull down with all your weight. Okay. You can do this. Are you ready? Yeah. One... Two... Three! Oh, God! Okay, all right, pull it off. Pull it off. Do it. Oh, my God. What are you doing? I got to get you out of these cuffs. All right, come here. Come here. Come on. Come on. Fuck. We're looking for a man named Brendan Park. His wife reported him missing. Uh... we have reason to believe that Mr. Reed was the last person to see him. Um, sorry, I don't know anything about that. What's your relationship to Mr. Reed? I'm, uh, a friend. Your name wouldn't happen to be Olivia, would it? No. Rachel. Would you mind showing me some ID? Of course. Wait one second. Let me find it. I know all women say this, but I swear, I can't find anything in this bag. Yeah, my wife, she says the... Wa-Wait... Gunshot. Go. Go! Fuck. Come on. I'm trying. Honey? That you? Mom. Jesus! You scared me. So how did it go? Did you meet with Jackson? I did. And? I'm working on it. Are you? All you had to do was get me access backstage. And I'll get it from him. I just need a little more time. Trust me. I don't trust anybody. I'll do it myself.
