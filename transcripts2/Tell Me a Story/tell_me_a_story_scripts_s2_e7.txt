 Dylan Young, private security. I just got a couple questions. Previously on Tell Me A Story... - No. I tracked down the man who put the bomb in your car. I heard about your dad. I'm so sorry. You are not a part of this investigation. You wouldn't even know that he was the bomber if it wasn't for me. Simone had proof that your mom was screwing your stepdad's lawyer behind his back. My father had you under surveillance. Cora, it's Simone. Are you here?

 What do you want from me? - You're gonna help me. And I'm gonna help you. Think of this as an opportunity. Tell me about Luke. Did he hit you? His twin sister died. How could he not tell you that? I think he's having an affair. I'll do some digging. Olivia! She got away, didn't she? There's no one around for miles. People are gonna miss me! You're right. They are.

 Tucker? Tucker? Wake up. Hmm. Rise and shine, sleepyhead. Anna? Is that you? How? Come on. I'll race you to the dock. Morning. Bad dream? I hope you don't mind, but I borrowed some of your clothes. You drugged me. Kind of messes with your head, doesn't it? What are you still doing here? You gonna kill me? So many questions. We'll get to all that. But first, you should know I only have one rule. Don't try to escape. If you do decide to try... ...I'll be watching. My phone. I'm curious. How did you get the...? Guess the passcode? You called me "Anna" before. You told me that she was your sister. And you chained me in a basement decorated like a little girl's room. Your passcode is two-six-six-two. Or, if you go by the letters... A-N-N... A. I'm so glad you were paying attention. What do you want with me? I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go upstairs and make myself some coffee. And when I get back, I'll be the one asking the questions. Oh, and in case it hasn't sunk in yet, you kidnapped the wrong woman. ...killed overnight in what seems to be a robbery and home invasion. Cora Covington, 52, was found dead in her home early this morning after an apparent break-in. No further details have been released from police. For nearly two decades, Covington worked as... I'm so sorry about Cora. Wish you would have let me come down to the station. Wouldn't have mattered. I told them it was Veronica. Now they have more questions. I can't say I blame them. I do, too. What about violating your parole? Who cares about parole? Cora is dead, and it's because of me. Hang on. You didn't kill her. Cora knew what she was getting into. She was the first one to say they killed your dad. Well, now she's dead, too. Maybe I'm next. Wade's people aren't gonna stop coming for their money just because he's in jail. We're gonna deal with all of this together. No. I... I can't do this anymore. Can't do what? What are you doing? Jackson, you're a nice guy, but let's not make this out to be more than what it was. Okay. I get it. I get it. You feel like you need to protect me, and you don't. Jackson, this is not real. It never was. No. No. Simone. I know you. You and I are the same. We-we screw up... We screw up anything good we got. Only this time, don't do it. No. No, no. You-you only think that you know me. I was using you. It's what I do. I don't believe you. Jackson, look at yourself. You're a drunk. And I have my own problems. I don't... I don't need you to be another one of them. Hey. Hey. You got an update for me? I... listen, I hate to bother you, but, um, do you think we could take a selfie first? So you've seen. Who hasn't? You're famous. I mean, it's everywhere. TMZ, Us Weekly, BuzzFeed. "The question on everyone's mind: who is Ashley Rose's mystery man?" Oh, God. You look good. Y-You're shorter in real life. They're blowing it out of proportion. Right. Hey, how's your dad doing? Uh, better. Yeah. You know the first thing he did out of ICU? Asked me to sneak in pancakes and bacon. But, uh, what'd really make him feel better is finding out who Dylan Young was working for. Okay, Beau, it's only been a few hours. All right? I am on Dylan's financial records. Somebody hired him. We'll find out soon. Have you spoken to Taylor, the girlfriend? I mean, she's got to know something. No. No, I-I hadn't thought of that. Beau, I want to keep you in the loop. But how do I know you're not just gonna go off on your own again? Because you have my word. I thought I had it last time. Then I had to kill someone to save your life. Look, I know I'm supposed to just sit here and do nothing, but my dad's already been shot. The person who wanted Ashley to die is still out there. And if something happens to her... I will let you know the second I find anything. I promise. You wanted to see us? Did you hear about Cora? Yeah. Yeah. They're saying it was a robbery gone wrong. Do they have any idea who did it? They're looking into it. And given what you did with Simone, I have to ask, because the police sure as hell are. Did you have anything to do with this? No. Mom, I swear. You boys were young when we moved in here, so maybe you don't remember what it was like before, when we had nothing, when I had to fight for every meal that I put on your plates. There's a line that we don't cross and I want to believe that you know that. I just wanted Simone out of the way. I didn't kill anybody. I believe you. So where were you last night? Before you came home. I was out. Was anybody with you? I'd consider your answer if I were you. Ron was with me. We went to the distillery last night. Had a couple drinks, then we went down to Broadway. In and out of a few bars. Really? You two, together? Wanted to bury the hatchet. We're family. That's supposed to mean something, isn't it? Well, you are making excellent progress. The skin grafts are healing nicely. Let's check your throat. Okay? Okay. You're a lucky woman. The damage to your vocal cords is almost completely healed. Have you tried to sing? Because I don't see any reason why you can't. I have. And? I can. But it's not like before. It's difficult. I see. Well, as far as the compression suit goes, you don't need it anymore. And I can provide you with a sleeve for just your arm. What about the mask? At this point, it's cosmetic, nothing more. You can take it off now, if you like. It still hurts. I don't think it's healed enough. I agree. We need some more time. Hold on a minute! Thank you. You can come in! Excuse me. Uh... Oh. I-I'm so sorry. I, uh... I was just performing a, uh, window sensor check. I'll, uh, come back later. I, uh, I think we're done here, right? Yeah. Ashley, I think you should go. Go where? Well, Beau is performing a sensor check. I thought... he could use your help. Hey, Beau. Wait up. Hey. Hey. I'm here to help you with the sensor something? Uh, y... My mom told me to come see you. Your mom told you to come see me? Yeah. Okay. How was everything with the doctor? Fine. You know, um... No real change. I'm sorry. That must be tough. Yeah. So... photos of us? Yeah, the press is, uh, having a field day. I'm sorry. I never meant to drag you into all this. No, uh... this is what it's like, huh? Having people watch your every move? It isn't the first time the tabloids have... speculated about my love life. Well, they, uh... ...they practically have us heading down the aisle. Crazy, right? Yeah. They're good at making something of nothing. Right? Yeah. You'd think people would, uh, stop believing what they read on the Internet. I should go. I got to brief the new security guy, so... Mike. Look, man, I know this is short notice; I... I can't make the gig tonight. I, um, I got that bug that's going around. I'm hacking up a lung, man. Well... whatever, man. You can believe me or don't believe me, I don't care. Well, then, you can get yourself another lead guitar player, because I fucking quit! Steve. Hey. Listen, you still got the hookup? Brought you something. Not hungry. I didn't say it was food. What do you want? Remember, I'm the one asking the questions now. When I escaped, there was a man who helped me. Where is he? I'm not doing this with you. I thought you might say that. Now who was he and where did he go? Do you think that I am afraid of you, Olivia? You're not gonna torture me. Ahh! Shall we try this again? The man who helped me... Fine. It doesn't matter anyway. His name is Brendan. He's a lawyer. He works with my fiancée, Maddie. And I promise you... he's gone. Gone? You mean...? I did what I had to do. His body? In the lake. What about his car and his phone? I took care of them. Good. After all, we wouldn't want someone to interrupt us, now would we? I think I know now why you don't have any close friends. You're insane. You know, my ex used to call me that. Right before his tragic and untimely death. You know... you kind of remind me of him. You said that Luke never hit you. That's not true. Is it? You're asking if he used to beat the shit out of me? Yes. His death wasn't an accident... was it? We do what we have to... don't we? You know, the police were just like you. It didn't even cross their minds that someone like me could kill a big, strong man like him. Olivia. Look at me. I'm not Luke. I took care of you, I fed you, I never hurt you. You kidnapped me. You drugged me and you chained me up like an animal, right here in this room! And now what, huh? I understand why you killed Luke. I do. It was self-defense. He was abusive. But I know you, Olivia. Stop pretending with me. You're not a killer. Are you sure about that? Sorry to keep you waiting. I got tied up on something else. Don't worry about it. Like I told you last night, Veronica Garland did this. Oh, we'll get to that. Just a few things first, where we left off. You said you knew Cora for a while. My whole life. Cora was my godmother. She was the one person my dad said I could always count on. I see. But recently you two hadn't spoken. Not for some time. Just the occasional call or e-mail. I haven't always been the easiest to get a hold of. Oh, I can imagine. I saw your record. Cora... she never judged me. She was the one who always wanted me to come back. No questions asked. She seemed like a really nice person. I'm sorry for your loss. So... why did you come back? My father's funeral. I'm sorry, am I a suspect? Simone, you're a felon who's done hard time and just happened to show up a few days ago. Veronica killed my dad so she could steal our company. Cora and I had proof she was having an affair with her attorney. Then she had Cora killed to get rid of the evidence. Okay, these photos, this proof. It's gone, I presume? It's the truth. Here's the thing. Infidelity is not a crime. Violating your parole is. That's what you did to get here, right when it seemed like your family's money was up for grabs. Simone, where were you last night? Ms. Garland, don't say another word. This interview is over. And you are? Madison Pruitt. I'm an attorney with Callaway, Crawford and Fenning. Ms. Garland is my client. What? No. I don't know you. Be that as it may, I've already reached out to the North Carolina Parole Commission. Ms. Garland is now in total compliance. Also, since she's mourning the loss of her godmother, she is in no condition to be questioned at this time. We're leaving. If you'd like to schedule anything further, please reach out to my office. Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Just make sure your client doesn't leave town. You'll have to go back in eventually, but you're not gonna do it alone.Thanks. You said your last name was Pruitt... Did Jackson send you? How do you know my brother? Oh, you're her. You're the-the mystery woman. I feel like I should be thanking you. You got him all cleaned up and in a tux. That's history for our family. Are you guys okay? I'm sorry. That's not my place. It's fine. I like him. I do. But sometimes it just runs its course. You know? And if Jackson asked you to help, I can't accept it. No, it wasn't him. All the same, I can take care of myself. Simone, I don't think that you appreciate your situation. You might not have killed your friend, but convincing the police is a whole other story. Why don't you let me help you? Tell me what's going on. Here comes my client. Let's talk later. Stay out of trouble, okay? Get in. Hey, Dad. Hope I didn't worry you. I know, I've been so busy. Oh, I found Reba. She came back all on her own. Something else happened. I met somebody. Well, I think he has potential. Oh, he's, he's a writer, actually. A novelist. I know. Oh, it's so nice to meet someone who shares a common interest. I miss you, too. Dad, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I'll talk to you later. So can I just get out wherever? Or am I some sort of prisoner? Cindy is my business manager. She's expecting your call. Ron told me that you have some outstanding debt, 300,000 worth. I'd rather not know the details. But Cindy will make the arrangements. Why are you doing this? Do I have to have some kind of ulterior motive? Simone, Cora was your mother's closest friend. And... there was a distance between us, but I relied on her. And I admired her. Then you fired her. Makes perfect sense. We disagreed on the direction of the business. But I would never want to hurt her. Somehow I doubt that. I assumed you would. Where are you taking me? Oh, so she doesn'tknow everything, after all. I was surprised to hear from you. Haven't seen you at the bar lately. I was seeing this girl. It didn't work out. I'm seeing a lot of girls. This one was... different. Yeah, they all are. Until they're not. You got to get back on that horse, cowboy. Brittany! Come here. Hi, Steve. You know my buddy Jackson? I don't believe I do. This is your place, right? That's right. It's nice. Do you play? Some? This guy's got music in his blood. His dad played with George Strait. He's a legendary drinker like his dad, too. Oh, his sister is Ashley Rose. Whoa. Seriously? My job here is done. Thanks, Steve. So, what's it like, having a famous sister? I don't really think about it that much. Or talk about it. Um, because... the accident? You know, it wasn't an accident. It was somebody trying to kill her. That-that's awful. Are you two close? I don't see her as much as I'd like to, but... yeah. We are. Oh. Well, she's lucky to have you. You need a refill? We have a problem. Tucker, it's me. I don't want our relationship to just run its course. I need to see you. I'm coming over. You need to call her and convince her not to come. Break up with her. I'm not gonna do that. You don't have a choice. I won't do it. You have no idea how much she means to me. Tucker. If she comes here, you know what I'm going to do. Olivia. Olivia, please. Please. I'll tell her who you really are. I'll show her what's buried under the rose bushes. I'll tell her what you did to Brendan. To me. You've been trying to protect her from all of that, haven't you? Well, this is how you protect her for good. She's never gonna believe me. You've been lying to her for this long. I bet you're really good at it by now. It's ringing. Tucker, I'm coming over. Okay? This is not a conversation that I want to have over the phone. Maddie, wait. Just listen to me. I have to tell you something. What? What, Tucker? What's so important you can't wait until I get there? It's over. The truth is, this hasn't been working for me. I haven't been able to sleep. I've been avoiding you. I keep trying to make this work, but I can't. What about the wedding? I can't marry you. Um... Is this about Olivia? Because I know that you haven't been telling me the truth about who she is. You were right about Olivia. Oh, my God. Um... How could you do this to me? I'm sorry. But we were broken. And we can't be put back together. Goodbye, Maddie. Come in. Hey. You got a few minutes? I'm sorry. I should've told you about my voice. I was just worried you were gonna tell Damien, start planning my comeback tour. Sounds like something I would do. You understand, sometimes it's hard for me to separate being your mother and being your manager. And I know I can be a little controlling. A little? But this is yourcareer. And only you can decide when and if to go back. I don't know if I'll ever be ready. Have you seen what people are saying about me? They're calling me Freddy Krueger, Phantom of the Opera. Looks matter. Of course they do, but they're not everything. When was the last time a woman had a hit who wasn't gorgeous? Let alone with half her face stitched back together. Talent means more than anything. Bullshit. No record company would sign me looking like this, regardless of how talented I am. I mean, come on, Mom, how many meetings did we have about my hair and makeup, wardrobe? It's... It's all about the package. Okay, well, then, let's make it about the music. Like you always wanted. Do you remember what Dad used to call me? Mm. You were his princess. Everyone used to always talk about how pretty I was. It was my thing. It's what gave me my confidence. I would go up on that stage and nothing could stop me. Honey, you are so much more than just a pretty face. And you have always been. I'm not the same person anymore. Of course not. You have been through hell. You are still here and you are stronger than ever. Whatever you want in this life is yours for the taking. You just have to want it. Follow me. What is she doing here? Funny, I was wondering the same thing. Is everybody aware that Ron here is a kidnapper? I'm just checking. He's been dealt with. Well, that's comforting. I'm just glad you're okay. I'm not. Your ass should be halfway back... Enough. Simone, I have tried money with you. I have tried anger. I have tried threats. But here we are, worse off than when we started. It's time to try something new. Being a family. You're joking. No. No more games. We have a spare room, and I want you to have it. Think of it as a-a fresh start. For all of us. You can't be serious. What do you expect us to do, just forgive and forget? We can try. That's what families do. I think it's a great idea, Mom. I think it's a fucking insult. We can't trust her. She's trying to destroy everything we've built. What's in it for you? It's not about me. It's what your father would have wanted. And despite what you think, I had nothing to do with his death. I loved him. And you're... all that's left of him. I'm not a monster. I can see you're hurting. We have both lost enough. I know how you feel about me, but feelings can change. I'm just asking for a chance. What will it be, Simone? Beau. Take a look at this. Let me handle it. Holy shit. Hey, Jackson. Yeah. What are you doing? I'm looking for my keys, man. They were just in my hand. Are, uh, you all right? I will be when I find my keys. Here they are. Oh. Thanks. Watch yourself. Hey. I know you, don't I? We've never actually met. Uh, I'm Beau. I'm part of Ashley's security team.Huh. Oh! Oh, no. You're the guy from the pictures with Ashley, right? Are you guys, like, together? Ah! Dude. I'm not one of those brothers who's, like, threatening their sister's boyfriend or anything like that. I'm... what-whatever makes everybody happy, you know? Right. And Ashley's great, man. She deserves somebody great. She is great. Uh... Does she know that you're stopping by? No. Shh. I'm-a surprise her. Have a jam session like old times. Hey. W-Why don't you just come back tomorrow? You know? Why? What's wrong with right now? You and I both know you're not in any condition to see her right now. What'd you say to me? Just let me drive you home. Fuck you, man. Hey, Jackson. Jackson... Hey, Ash! Hey, Ash! Ashley! Where are you at? Jackson. Jackson. Hey. Don't do this. Ashley! Ashley, where you at? You stop right there. You do not come into this house yelling and screaming. Jackson, is everything okay? I just thought m-maybe we could hang out. I've had a bad day, and I thought maybe we could write a song about it. You're drunk. You're just jealous. Of you? Of the fact that Ashley and I have always connected over music. And we got that from Dad. What is wrong with you? How much time you got, Mom? Get out. Now. Let's go. Ash. Now. I'll drive you. Nuh-uh, I'm good. Beau. Turn it off. Turn off the truck! What? I can't hear you. Sorry. I'm not gonna let you do this. I mean it. I am not moving from here. Get out of my way. No! Damn it! What are you doing? Just let me leave, then you'll never have to see me again. What, you think that's what I want? Isn't it? No, you know what I want for you? I want you to be safe and I want you to be happy. Pruitts... Pruitts don't get to be happy, Mom. Oh, your dad did this to you. You know, he-he continues to destroy this family after all these years. Jackson, you have to stop blaming yourself. You didn't kill your father. You were 15. You were a child. And he was not your responsibility. I should've taken the keys away, Mom. I knew he was drunk. I got in the truck anyway. He-he put you in danger, not the other way around. Mom, I should've died. I should've died with him. It would've been better for everybody. It was hard to lose your father, but if I had lost you... I wouldn't have survived that. I don't want to be like Dad. Then prove it and give me those keys. Please. Come inside. No, I want to be alone. Feeling better? I read your book. Clearly, it was about Anna and the guilt that you felt when she died. You're really not gonna talk? You want to know why I came back? When I was out in those woods, I felt so alone. It made me realize that's how I always feel. When you first brought me here, you told me that we were gonna help each other. I came back because I realized that if there's anyone that can understand me, it's you. You kill people, I've killed people. Luke wasn't the only one. You've killed others? I don't think it was an accident that you picked me. This is fate. The difference between you and me is that you're sick. Everything I've done, I did because I had to. You talk about yourself like you're the victim. When I lost my sister, I lost a part of myself that I can never get back. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't function. I had to find a way to cope. By murdering women. They forced my hand. And you call me sadistic. No, I think you're a liar. All those lies you told, all those tears, that was just a show, wasn't it? You and I are nothing alike. I love Maddie. Have you ever loved anyone? No. No, you haven't. Because you're not capable. You're right. I have a hard time connecting. I don't think I ever really have. But your book, those emotions were real. How you feel about Maddie, that's real. What I can't seem to understand is how that's even possible for someone like you. Why you and not me? Well, if you think I'm gonna help you with that, then you really are crazy. Where are you going? Olivia. This used to be the maid's room. She expect you to start cleaning the house, too? I'm just happy to have a place to call home. It's been a while. So you're really going along with this? Your mom makes a good point. Maybe it's time to stop fighting. What good has it done? Bullshit. You were the most stubborn kid I ever knew. Even more stubborn than Ron, which is saying something. People change. Not you. You punched Glenn Hollar in the face after you found out he'd been bullying me. You don't just stand by. This isn't you. I'm sorry you feel that way. You think Mom ordered Ron to kill Cora. And Dad. I don't know what I think. But you're here to find out, right? I'm not here to fight. I'm gonna fall in line. Who knows, maybe there's a job for me at the distillery. So you expect me to believe that you're not gonna fight? I'm not. You shouldn't, either. ♪ I'll be right here, Miss. Hey. What are you... Can I come in? Your place is nice. I mean, it's-it's-it's nothing fancy. I like it. It's very you. I'm sorry, but what are you, what are you doing here? We didn't get to finish our conversation earlier. No, I think you said everything you needed to say. I didn't. Truth is, I haven't been completely honest with you, or myself. When I said that there was nothing between us, I lied. I was scared. I couldn't believe that someone would want to be with me, like this. Oh, uh... You never have to feel that way with me. I feel that way with everyone. I can tell when people are trying not to look at my face, or when they sneak a peek, or when they just stare. It's gonna be like this for the rest of my life. Not everybody sees your scars. When I look at you, I just see you, and I think you are so beautiful. The doctor said I don't have to wear my mask anymore. I'm afraid. You don't have to be. No. Sorry. I can't. No, no. You're okay. It's okay. Whenever you're ready. I don't know what this is between us, but I really want to see where it goes.
