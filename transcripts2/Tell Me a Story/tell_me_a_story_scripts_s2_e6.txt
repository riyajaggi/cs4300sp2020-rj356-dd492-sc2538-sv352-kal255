 Your father loved you. SIMONE: You were having an affair. You changed the trust, and then you pushed my dad down the stairs. I am done with you harassing this family! I think this belongs to you. Stop! Stop! I said enough! I'll wait for you outside. What do you want from me? TUCKER: I'm a writer. My new book is about love and loss. Tell me about Luke. Do you miss him? Who's Olivia? She's my editor's new assistant. I think he's having an affair.

 But I would never cheat on Maddie.Are you sure about that? 'Cause I might do some digging myself. [both grunting, shouting] Help! Help me, please! Go! Olivia! [thunder crashing] ♪ [panting] [grunts] [screams] TUCKER [in distance]: Olivia! [grunts] ♪ [chain snaps] [car alarm blaring] Shit. Come on. What the fuck are you doing? [grunting, wheezes] I bet you're thinking, "Why the hell did I follow him home?" I did it for Maddie. No, you didn't. You wanted to be some kind of fucking hero, so you can swoop on in, save the day, huh?That's not true. Yes, it is. Not true. Where's the girl? Was that Olivia? She got away, didn't she? Shut the fuck up. Oh, the cops could be here any minute. It's over. You're done. It's not over. There's no one around for 30 miles. I grew up hunting in these woods. There's nowhere for her to go. She's weak, she's frightened, and she's lost. Don't worry, I'll find her. And then what? You, Maddie and your captive live happily ever after?We're not talking about Maddie. Where's your cell phone, huh? Did you leave it in the car? Mm. That's just too bad, isn't it? People are gonna miss me. My wife, my boss, even Maddie. They're gonna be looking for me. You're right. They are. [grunting] [phone chimes] [grunting] ♪ ♪ ♪ [indistinct whispering] What's going on? There was an incident last night. Ken was shot. [exhales] Is he...? He's alive. Beau is at the hospital with him now. They tracked down the man who put the bomb in your car.You were right. It wasn't Kyle. It was a man named Dylan Young. He shot Ken before getting away.Police are looking for him now. I have to go to the hospital.We can protect you better here. Someone should be there for Beau. We'll both go. Bring the car around. [doorbell rings] [scoffs] Back for more? I knew you were stupid, but... Where is she? Where's Simone? Did something happen? You lose her somewhere? I don't have time for your shit. Is she here? [chuckles][scoffs] Oh. If you think you're taking one step in this house... VERONICA: Let him in. We always make time for guests. At least you didn't break in this time. Jackson, wasn't it? What can I do for you? Simone disappeared last night. She's not answering her phone. I've looked everywhere. Did you try the police station? Maybe someone wasn't as kind as I've been about her violating her parole.You did something to her. I know it. You're looking in the wrong place. I have no clue where she is. Ron will see you out. You know, she's not the only one who knows what you've done, and pretty soon everybody's gonna know. Is that a threat? Do yourself a favor. Just let her go. [engine starts] Hey! Jackson, hold up. [engine turns off] Look, I care about Simone, too. Uh-huh. I do. Simone was the only one in that house that stood up for me. I was closer to her than I was with my own brother. You really care about Simone? Then convince your mom and your brother to tell me where she is. You really think it was my family? Simone had proof that your mom fixed everything for herself. She threw it in your mom's face, and now she's gone. This proof, you're sure it's real? Your mom was screwing your stepdad's lawyer behind his back. What the hell are you talking about? Your stepdad found out about it. I saw the pictures myself. Give me your phone. If Ron took her, you're gonna need this. Access to all our warehouse locations. Good luck. [engine starts] [banging in distance] [banging continues] [grunting] TUCKER: Olivia?! Olivia?! LUKE: Olivia? Olivia, it's okay. Come on, Olivia, open the door. I don't think so. I just want to talk.I want that, too, but only when you've calmed down. I am calm! I'm calm. [breathing heavily]I just want to know who you were talking to at the coffee shop. You know Ezra. He's in my writers group. Are you fucking him? He's just a friend, Luke. If that's true, open up! I can't keep doing this with you! All I... all I want is an honest conversation. I want that, too. But only when you've calmed down. Right now, you need to go. Where the fuck am I supposed to go?! [grunts] Don't do this. You don't get to tell me what to do. [grunts] ♪ ♪ ♪ Hey. Beau... Hi. Wh-What are you doing here? I heard about your dad. I'm so sorry. How's he doing? He went back into surgery, ma'am. Internal bleeding. I haven't heard anything in a while.Let me try. They've been pretty tight-lipped. I can be quite persuasive. You mean scary? What can I do? Do you want food, coffee, anything? No. I-I can't. Um... You know, when I was a kid, I worried, uh, every time my dad went to work, you know. But, um, he used to say the bad guys didn't stand a chance because he was too strong. He didn't look strong today. It was the first time I've ever seen my dad look scared. He's got you. I almost got him killed. You didn't do this. [camera clicks nearby] [camera clicks] You... you shouldn't be here. I'm glad you came, but... Dylan Young is still out there. You're not safe. I-I don't want you to be alone. It is my job to protect you. Okay? I can't do that here. He's stable. They brought him into recovery. [exhales sharply] You should rest. Thank you, ma'am, I will. Bye. [exhales] [laughs softly] [engine starts] ♪ [gasping, grunting][lock clicks] BRENDAN: Where have you been? You didn't find her, did you? She's still out there. It's not like she's the most dangerous game. You know you're sick, right? You have no idea what it's like to really suffer. Unable to sleep, to create. Never truly living. I had to do something. I understand. Oh, shut up. Don't try to play me. Olivia wasn't happy. Her life was a disaster. It was empty, meaningless. I rescued her from that. I gave her a purpose. Look, so far, you haven't really hurt anyone. Look, I know the law. Just let me go. I can't do that. Yes, you can. Okay, this is, this is crazy. This does not end well. You know that. I know. And I wanted this time to be different. This time? Oh, fuck, th-there are others? Oh, fuckin' shit. Fuck. Fuck! Hey, please... don't do this. You did this to yourself.I know. I know. I'm sorry. You came into my home. You invaded my privacy. I know. I-I know. I'm sorry. I didn't want this, but you just couldn't let Maddie go, could you? What about your own wife, Brendan? Does she know that you're still not over Maddie? I-I love my wife, okay? Obviously, you don't; otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Please. Please, don't-don't... I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry! Don't! [whimpers] The other girls, they didn't suffer. They knew it was better not to fight. [grunting] [moans weakly] Dying like this, it'll be just like falling asleep. In a way, I'm jealous. ♪ ♪ Get the fuck out the car. [engine turns off, door opens] What the fuck do you think you're doing? Back up. Make me. I'm not playing. Look, this little game of "follow the leader" is over. Tuck your tail and run back home to Mommy. Mom lied. So did you. Everything Simone said last night is true, isn't it? About Mom having an affair, changing Dad's trust. Dad left the distillery to Simone, didn't he? Don't ask questions you don't really want to know the answer to. I want to know where Simone is. You took her, admit it. I don't got to admit shit to you. I don't owe you a thing. Where is she? [chuckling] All right. I'll tell you what I know. But first, I'm gonna need you to beg. All right? Go on!No. Do it. Fuck you. [grunting] Everything I do, I do for this family. All right? To protect us. And what do you do, huh? You just sit on the sideline and complain that coach won't put you in. So come on, mama's boy, get up. Do something about it for once. Didn't think so. [engine starts] [siren wails] [camera clicking] Damn it, Beau, you cannot be here. I can't just wait at the hospital doing nothing, okay? Tell me what is going on. Any signs of Young? You are not a part of this investigation.You wouldn't even know that he was the bomber if it wasn't for me. Based on evidence I gave you. You don't think I'm gonna catch shit for that? Look, if they come after you, they'll have to admit that they fucked up by closing the case, okay? Come on, Gwen, you have got to give me something, please. We're still looking for Young. Unis searched the area. We are trying to track down his girlfriend, his mother, former cellmate, anyone who might be helping him.Any idea on a motive? Not yet. You need to stay out of this, Beau. I can help you. You are too emotionally involved. No.Go, be with your dad. I'll let you know when we find Young. ♪ ♪ [drops cord] [door opens in distance] Hello? [door opens] Sorry, no more free shots. Son of a bitch. I'm not all bad. I left you some clothes, brought you some food. Didn't bring you here to starve you to death. Then what am I doing here? I knew you wouldn't leave on your own, so I figured you might need a little escort back to where you belong. Ron, what did you do? You'd be surprised what a couple of calls can turn up. The people you worked for back in... back in North Carolina are still looking for you. But my guess is you already knew that. You have no idea what you've done. Hey, I didn't do a thing. They wanted to come get you. I just told them where to find you. They're going to kill me, Ron. Yeah, well, whatever happens, the way I see it is, you had it coming, Simone. We both know this isn't you. You're a con artist. You use people. That's not me, not anymore. Keep telling yourself that. You can play dress up all you want to, it's not gonna change who you are. [door opens] [door closes] Hey, wait.What do you want? Just want to talk to you.About what? About Dylan Young. How do you know him? I don't. You seem very interested in what's happening at his house. What are you, a cop?No, I'm not. Then I don't have to talk to you. Hey. You're lying. Let go of me.Who is Dylan to you? Is he your boyfriend?What do you care? Dylan just shot my father. Okay? I didn't know. Did you know he also tried to kill Ashley Rose? What? No. I have a video of him planting the bomb on her car. I-I'm sorry. I... You have to tell me where he is. I don't know.Hey, hey. Look at me. I know you think you're doing the right thing by protecting him, yeah? But more people will get hurt. [sighs] If Dylan finds out that I told you where he is... I will protect you, I promise. But he needs to be stopped. Okay. Okay. [phone vibrating] Yeah, what? Any luck finding her? No, I've been to half a dozen of your family's storage facilities; nothing so far. What if I could help you narrow it down? Derek, if you know where she is, tell me now. I don't, not exactly. But when Ron left, he left out the back gate. Think I know where he was headed. Okay, keep talking. [guitar playing] ASHLEY: ♪ Waiting ♪ Wondering ♪ Hoping for someone ♪ Like you [vocalizing] ♪ I don't want to let ♪ You go ♪ You were never mine ♪ ♪ To hold ♪ You were never mine ♪ ♪ Love frozen in time. [stops playing] Wow. Your voice sounds amazing. [chuckles] Thanks. I knew it would come back.I didn't. First couple times I tried, it sounded like shit. How does it feel? Does it hurt? No. It actually feels really good. That's great. Well, Mom must be over the moon. Surprised you're not already back on tour. I haven't told her. Oh. Not yet. I really want to take this slowly. You're the only one that knows. I'd like to keep it that way. Of course. I won't say anything. Thanks. I heard about Ken. How's Beau holding up? [sighs] He's tired, worried. Really glad you went to see him. We're friends. Nothing more? Mom told you?Why didn't you? We kissed a couple times, no big deal. Okay, so there's potential. And he's very sweet and hot. [chuckles] It's a nice distraction, that's all. Well, he'd be really lucky to be with you. Really? Yeah. Anybody would be. Be lucky to deal with this? Ashley, you are still so, so beautiful. That's not what people see when they look at me. They see a monster. Someone to be feared, pitied. Who cares what people think? I do. And so will any man that's with me. They have to deal with that, too. Not to mention all the surgeries, skin grafts, therapy... [chuckles] Who would want to take that on? I wouldn't. So you're never gonna give anybody a chance? I have to be realistic. Not everybody gets their "happily ever after." [door opens] [exhales] [grunting] ♪ [panting] [laughing] [panting] [door opens in distance] Wade. You never had much good to say about Nashville. Starting to think I understand why. You'll forgive me if I don't feel like joking. What are you doing here, Simone? You didn't think you can come back home and just start over again, did you?Would that be so crazy? Crazy is thinking you could just take off when you still owe people $300,000. I went to prison, Wade, for three years. The state has their money. Well, they don't see it that way. Give me time. I can still get it, all of it.Look, I'm sorry, Simone. We're due back in Charlotte in the morning. You could let me go. You could say I was already gone when you got here. For your sake, I wish you were. Come on, move it. Move. I don't want to have to drag you out of here, but I will if I have to. Come on. Move. [vehicle approaching] Simone! Goddamn it, Simone. [shrieks] Thought I'd go without a fight? [grunting] You're testing my patience. [both grunting] Now you're gonna suffer. He could've killed you. Guess I still got a little luck left in me. Wait, who are you calling?The cops. You can't be here. Meet me back at my place? I need to go to Cora; she's got the pictures. They're all I've got.Hey. That's not entirely true. DISPATCHER [over phone]: 911. What's your emergency? [wine pouring] You gonna leave without saying goodbye? Private reserve. No point in saving it. Mm. So, did you... ask Tucker why he lied to you? About his sister? Yeah, we talked about it. It's fine. It's fine? To keep a secret like that?Mom. From your fiancée? His twin sister died. How could he not tell you that? All that I am saying is that it is impossible to have a healthy relationship if you are keeping secrets from each other. [laughs softly] You mean like you and Dad? How does your father have anything to do with this? Come on, I know he cheated on you. All that fighting-- it was impossible not to hear. How did you find out? Mm. I went to see him perform. He didn't know that I was there. I saw him with one of his backup singers. I could tell by the way that he, uh... he looked at her. Yeah. [chuckles wryly] I think Tucker's cheating on me. Are you sure? No. I don't even know if I want to know.Oh, yeah, you do. When I suspected your father, I confronted him. He confessed. Apologized. And you forgave him? I tried to. I didn't want it to... destroy our family. And deep down, I loved him still. [softly]: Yeah. [crying]: I don't know what to do. [sighs] You don't have to make any decisions until you know the truth. [exhales shakily] [door opens][exhales] [door closes] VERONICA: Thank you, Officer, for your hard work. That was the metro police. There seems to have been a break-in in one of our warehouses. Nothing was stolen, but a man was arrested. An ex-con from North Carolina, of all places. That's interesting. Get over here. ♪ I'm sorry, Mom. For which part? I've lost count. You have made quite the mess, and now it's up to me to clean it up.

I am this close to putting a bullet in your fucking brain, all right? Do not test me. What do you want from me? Why did you plant a bomb in Ashley Rose's car? Tell me why you tried to kill her! I don't know. What, you just wanted to blow somebody up, is that it? Look, man, it was just a job. It wasn't personal. Somebody paid you to kill her? Who was it? I didn't get a name. Bullshit. Tell me. Who hired you? [grunts] [grunts] [yells] [gunshot] [sniffs, grunts] Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. Oh, no. [panting] Hello? Cora? Cora, it's Simone. Are you here?
