 I have to be at the lake. I have a deadline. Mm. Okay. Do you have court today? Nope. Two briefings and a deposition. Ooh. So that means we have time to go back to your place then. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hang on, hang on. This is Maddie. Jackson? I can't hear you. What? Pruitt. I really appreciate it.

 No worries. We didn't bother with the charges. Marty, I owe you big. Ah, I may have to hit you up for tickets one day. My little girls, they love your sister. Done. You've gone above and beyond and I cannot thank you enough. And I know that Jackson thanks you, too. I understand. We all got that one family member.Yeah. Did you hurt anyone? No. I pretty much got the short end of the night. I'm out of favors, Jackson. Next time you go honky-tonkin', try Kentucky. Welcome, everybody, to the Ashley Rose album debut, coming to you live tonight! Hi.Nice to meet you, too. Hey. Jackson. Where you been? What is Terry doing here? Uh, have you talked to your mom? No. You should talk to your mom. What's going on? Why is Terry here? He's playing lead guitar. I'm here now. Yeah, I can see that. But you're two rehearsals and a sound check too late. You can't fire me. It's not your call. Actually, it is. Does Ashley know? She understands what tough love is. And until you get your shit together, Terry's playing lead guitar. What am I supposed to do? Mm. There's an open bar; I'm sure you'll figure it out. Hi. Thank you. Can I get you, uh, another drink? Uh, not for me. Um, one second. You look amazing. Maddie! I'm freaking out. I'm on overload. Well, you look fucking awesome. Mom fired Jackson. Well, we knew that was coming. I want to fire her. She didn't even ask me first, she just did it. Are you serious? I can't take any more of her controlling, bulldozing crap. I'm 25 fucking years old. When is it gonna stop? You're her child. She'll always see you as that.Yeah. Then she shouldn't be my manager. Ash, we need to go. I love you. I love you. I'll see you later. Bye. Go, go, go. So here we are, celebrating the first single from the upcoming debut album, Thorns, from Ashley Rose. So, tell us, what's going through your mind right now? Um, just how incredibly grateful I am. Tell the audience how this big night came to be. How did you get here? Well, I grew up singing anywhere I could. At the church choir, fairs, rodeo. And then YouTube. It snowballed after that.Yeah. At lightning speed. You're unstoppable. Stop. You're gonna curse me. Here's Ashley Rose performing the first single from her debut album. We love you, Ashley! Ashley, I love you! Ashley! Hi. Miss Rose, we have your car waiting. Thank you. Can I get my car? See you at home. Bye. Ashley! Let go of me! Help me. Please help me! Help me! No! In entertainment news, country star Ashley Rose will be released today from Central Nashville Medical Hospital, where she's been recovering from injuries sustained in a car bombing three months ago. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. Reporter Charlotte Davis is live outside the hospital with more on this story. Charlotte? Fans have been gathering for hours, in hopes to see Ashley Rose as she's released today. Fans and family both frustrated with local police, but Ashley's mother recently released a statement that the family still trusts that local law enforcement will find the culprit and bring him to justice. Other artists are stepping in to show their support by way of social media... Why didn't you just knock? I didn't want to interrupt... in case you had lady company. "Lady company." Yeah. It's when a man spends time with a woman. You should try it. Maybe I'll get some grandkids before I'm 80. Don't hold your breath, old man. Good. Doing your homework. It's on every channel, I can't escape it. With the perp still at large... I think what you meant to say was, "Thanks, Dad", "for getting me this job... while I'm unemployed." Administrative leave. You did the right thing. As soon as Nashville PD finishes their report, they'll see it that way, too. You'll be reinstated, don't you worry. Let's go. Morning. Oh... Here you go. Thank you. Ah, did you sleep any? Some. Not really. Did you call Dr. Amed? You're gonna be late for court. You said you'd call. You need pills. I have pills. They don't work. They just fuck up my head and make me buy things off of Amazon. What time is Ashley being released? Late morning. I'm gonna head over there before work. Did you want to come? No, I can't. I got to write. I'm four weeks behind on my deadline. It's a waste of time. You're marrying a crazy writer. Remember?: Yeah. Jesus. Where are you going so fancy? I got somewhere to be. I think Dane knows. Who's Dane? My husband. Oh. What makes you think he knows? I can sense it. And he asked me who I was fucking. Maybe you should stop coming over. Really? That's your response? What do you want me to say? Something else. You shouldn't be cheating. It's wrong. Because flights are too expensive right now, and I just can't get the time off work. Well, tell Dad I said happy birthday. I'll make it up to him. No, this was the right decision. I'm loving it here, really. I... Okay, Mom, look, I've got to go. I love you. Bye. Hey. Guys got any news? I'm here to see Ashley. Could you tell us anything about her condition? Ashley? Ashley? Ashley, Dr. Lopes is here. Big day. How you feeling? Scared. Anxious. Understandable. It's okay. You feel whatever you need to feel. Let me take a look at your skin grafts. Wear your mask and compression sleeves as much as you can. It'll help to stretch the scar tissue. Okay? Hey, you got this. What about singing? Well, Ashley's airway and vocal cords were severely damaged, so it's hard to say yet. Thank you. And keep your appointment with Dr. Johnson. It's important you have someone to talk to. You're gonna feel a lot of emotions over the next few months. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. Okay. Car's outside. Ashley, this is Ken Morris. I-I told you about him. He runs the security firm that the label hired for you. So, how does this work? You have a team of three. At least one person will be with you all the time. And how is it outside? Lot of fans and news outlets. Could the person who did this be out there? Don't worry. We're gonna keep you safe. This is Beau, ma'am. He's part of my team. And your son. The police officer, right? Yes, ma'am. Nice to meet you. I'm ready. Hi.Ma'am. Hold. Hey, asshole, that's mine. What do you think you're doing? I'm a doctor. I work here. No, you're not. This is fake. How'd you get in here? I'm a fan. I just wanted a photo. Jesus. Get out of here. Go! It's all clear. Keep it moving. It's a zoo out front. We can't go out there. Step back. Step back. Move. Move out of the way. It's not Ashley. - Where is she? - Ashley! She's still inside. Nice work. There she is. What's your name? Beau, ma'am. Thank you, Beau. How's the security team? Oh, they're fine. Thank you so much, Damien. Oh, no, we're happy to do it. They can stay as long as you need. Anything for our girl. Mm. How is she? Well, she's been through an ordeal. How does she look? Damien. What? I know it's a terrible question, completely inappropriate, but here's another one. Can she sing? Do we know the full extent of the damage done to her voice? The doctors are confident that she will make a full recovery. Did they say that, or is that wishful thinking? Damien, she just got home. Can we table this for another time? It's not me, Rebecca, okay? It's the label. They want a realistic idea of what to expect. Another time, please. Jeff, this my son, Beau. He'll be working with us the next few weeks. Nice to meet you. I oversaw the installation of this security system. It has all the latest features: Motion sensors, panning and tilting cameras, laminated glass on all the windows, you name it. I'm gonna make a perimeter sweep. We got paps out there. Copy that. Is your feed blowing up? Everyone wants to know what I look like. They're voting how bad my face is. Deadpoolguy is inching out Exorcistgirl. Great. Have you heard anything more from the police? They're investigating, which means they're clueless. Well, look, now you have three massive bodyguards to protect you, okay? And me. It's gonna be okay, Ash. How bad is it? 27% of my body. Well, I mean, did the doctors talk to you about cosmetic surgery options? My skin grafts are healing. They told me to manage my expectations about that, which never sounds good. Well, listen, whatever you need, okay? I'm serious. You want to, like, hit me or scream at someone, I'm here for you. Okay? Who are all these people? From the label, mostly. Ashley's first day home, and they decided to stop by. Where is she? Hiding in her room. Are you okay? What happens to Ashley if she can't sing? Can the label drop her? I don't think we need to be worried about that right now. But you handled her contract. What happens? If she can't render services, which is outlined as two albums and coinciding tours, then, yes, they can terminate at will. Now's not the time for that, Mom. Hi. Hey. Hi. Hi. You're alive. How is she? I was just gonna head up. Yeah. Hi, Mom.Jackson. I wasn't expecting you to stop by. Why wouldn't I? Well, you never came to the hospital. Sure I did. Just not when you were there. Your flowers are half dead... you need to put them in some water. I, uh... I've been, uh, playing in a band around town. And they're... decent. Getting some buzz. Good for you. Yeah. And I'm sober. Really? You going to meetings? How many days you got? Your sister's upstairs. Hey. Hey. Hey. How's the patient? She is a sad country song, but I'm working on her. All right, I'm gonna go get something to eat. Bring you back a plate? Yeah. Hey, sis. Hi. Okay, that's not so bad. It's like a female Phantom of the Opera. There's definitely a, uh, touring company in your future. We're not making jokes yet. You got it. How do you feel? Okay... to awful... to nothing. Who's downstairs? Uh, well, let's see, there's, uh, Mom and Damien, your entire record label, some publicists, a few random extras from central casting. Can you get rid of them? Ah, no, everybody... everybody... wants to see you.Yeah. I think they care about you. They just want to know if I can sing. Yeah, probably. Can you? I don't know. I haven't tried yet. My throat still feels... raw. Well, don't let them push you. Okay? You take your time. I'm so glad you're alive, Ash. Me, too. Hey there. What's your name? "Reba." Aren't you sweet. Yeah. Yeah. Ah. Hello? Hello? Reba, was that you? Come here, silly. Come here. Hey, Drew. Bourbon, rocks. Hi there. Hi. I'm sorry, what did you say? Hi? Hi. Hi. Hello. How you doing? I'm not really here to meet people. Yeah, I typically go to a crowded bar when I feel like being alone, too. I didn't say I wanted to be alone. Are you here for the band? Because that guitar player was awesome, wasn't he? Hot. I didn't really notice. I mean, he had mad skills, like Hendrix or something; You didn't notice that? I'm not really into Jimi Hendrix. Get out. Out! Right now, just go. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Who do you like? Chet Atkins? Buddy Holly? Keith Urban? Brad Paisley? Slash? Who? B.B. King. "The Thrill is Gone." I love B.B. King. Come on, I'm harmless. I doubt that. I'm Jackson. Simone. Hmm. We've been having some trouble with the door sensor in the master upstairs. Want to take a look? You got it, Pops. Let's keep it to "Ken" while we're working. Yes, sir. Copy that. Come in. I just need to check one of your doors, ma'am. Sure. You can drop all that "ma'am" stuff. I feel like my mother is standing behind me. Of course, ma'am. Sorry. Ashley. I'm in the master now. It's Beau, right? That's right. Like, um, B-O? Uh... E-A-U. My-my mom was French. I almost ended up as a Pierre. You know, Beau means "beautiful." I went through a whole Francophile phase in high school. Ate macarons, quoted Les Miz, wore a ton of ugly scarves. It's not something I'm proud of. Have you always worked in security? I'm actually a police officer with the Nashville PD. Um, currently on leave. Why on leave? It's a long story. Tell me the short version. Another time? Well, I... think that did the trick. Here. Here, let me get that. No, I got it. Hm. Um, thank you. It's no problem. Where do you want me to put this? In the closet. Good night. Good night. So, you're new to Nashville? I never said that. Oh, so, you grew up here? I didn't say that, either. Well, you haven't said anything. Does it matter? You won't remember a word I say. Are you implying that I'm drunk? It's indisputable fact. I mean... Why did you come out tonight? I don't know. I wanted some air. I needed to breathe, so I just started walking. Oh, so you live in the neighborhood? And I heard the music, and I wandered in. I just... I wanted a drink. And now you've had three. No, I've had two. I don't know how many you've had. Almost midnight. Wait, wait, wait. You gonna turn into a pumpkin? It was nice to meet you, Jackson. Wait. Whoa, whoa. No, no. Don't leave just yet. Hold on. I'll walk you. I'll walk you. I don't think walking's gonna happen for you. Well, then, I'll drive you. It was nice to meet you, Jackson. Please don't drive. Can I have your phone number? I don't think so. Why not? I just don't... Piece of shit! Hey! You stay away from my wife! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy. Back off. He's fucking my wife. I heard you. Now go. You have my gun. No... Go get it. You don't want nothing to do with this guy. He's dirt. You all right? Come on. Yup. Get up... Where's your keys? Ah. Where's your car? Oh.All right. Come on. Honestly, I'm just more concerned about the trauma of it all. I mean, she has not begun to deal with what's happened to her at all. She's still in shock. That shit takes time. Yeah. Yeah, it does. Hey, Tuck? Mm-hmm? Are you having cold feet about the wedding? No. Of course not. 'Cause something's wrong. We're not connecting the way we used to. Do you feel that? Honey, relationships are an ocean. Right? The waves go up and down... Oh, my God. Wow. Deflection by way of bad analogy. That's cool. I'm being serious. What's going on? Just talk to me. Talk to me. No. Look at me. Look at me. I cannot wait to marry you. I love you so much. So much. Come here. Mmm. Just kiss me. Kiss me first. Oh, come here. Is something wrong? Fuck. I'm sorry. I don't know what's... I don't know what's going on. Things will get better, I promise. I... Okay.Please. Okay. Okay, O... You're very nice. And you're very drunk. And bleeding. It happens. Yeah? Does this kind of thing happen a lot to you? Uh... Define "a lot." Why can't I have your number? Why do you want my number? Ooh... Because... I made you smile 11 times tonight. Twelve. And... I don't make a lot of people smile these days. I think I'm on to something. Thirteen. Wait, wait, wait, quick. Smile again, quick. Come on. Yeah. Good. I don't need any more bad luck. Yeah. No. No, don't go. I'm sorry, Jackson, but you're the last thing in the world I need right now. Good night. Ashley? Ms. Rose? What are you doing? I knocked... Um, I'm sorry. Are you watching me? No.What the fuck are you doing? I didn't know you were bathroom. Get out! I'm sorry. Get the fuck out of here! Get out! Leave! Sorry. Get out! Get out! No news when the delayed album will be released, so for now, a little tease from the YouTube sensation. Here's Ashley Rose unplugged. Hey, guys, I'm working on this song for my new album. Let me know what you think.
