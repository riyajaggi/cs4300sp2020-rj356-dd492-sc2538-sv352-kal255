 Previously on Tell Me A Story... If Dylan knew I was talking to anybody... I will protect you. More people will get hurt. But he needs to be stopped. I don't know what this is between us. But I really want to see where it goes. You feel like you need to protect me, but you don't. Look at yourself. You're a drunk. And I have my own problems.

 I don't, I don't need you to be another one of them. (grunts) Simone had proof that your mom was screwing your stepdad's lawyer behind his back. It's time to try something new... being a family. We have a spare room and I want you to have it. What do you expect us to do, just forgive and forget? We can try... that's what families do. His twin sister died. How could he not tell you tha? Morning. Bad dream? You drugged me. Kind of messes with your head, doesn't it? (phone vibrates)

 You need to call her and break up with her! It's over. I can't marry you. You were right about Olivia. It's been going on for a long time. (birds chirping) (footsteps approaching) (heavy rattling) (locks clicking) (door creaks) Oh, good. You're awake. I didn't sleep. I'm hungry and I'm thirsty. When you were down here, I made sure you never wanted for food or water. I never wanted to be down here. We can talk about getting you some food, but first, let's talk about why you can't sleep. You know why. I know about your beloved sister, and your incessant need to be next to her. But I'm thinking it's something different. Maybe it's your other lady causing your restless nights. Maddie. Don't say her name. You two fascinate me. You know, I have to ask... she and I both have dark hair. We look alike. But you wanted to marry her. Not just chain her up like your next sleep doll. What is it about her? What makes her special? I'm not talking about her with you. I assumed that was the case. Hoped I was wrong, though. Certainly was last night. (sighs) After your broke up, I assumed that Maddie would go out on the town. Drink to forget... you know, that sort of thing? Nope. She went home. All by herself. (chains rattling) Listen to me. You stay the fuck away from her. Someone's a little cranky. I think it's time for your nap. TUCKER: What are you doing? No, I can't use a sedative. They make it worse, not better. Makes what worse? You have nightmares. If I'm drugged, I can't wake up. I'm trapped. Oh. Oh, well. Maybe this will help. (lamp creaking) Now it's time for your medicine. Please. You're gonna take this... or I'm gonna kill Maddie. (grunting) (grunting) Sweet dreams. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (laughs softly) (knocking) Good morning. Hey. Aw... you all right? (sighs) Why'd you read that stuff? It's just a license for people to be cruel. Not all of them. This a post from a fan in Seattle. Two years ago, she woke up in the middle of the night. Her house was on fire. By the time they rescued her, she had burns over 75% of her body. Her whole life fell apart. She dropped out of college. She cut herself off from the world. That's horrible. Seeing pictures of me in public, not hiding... She said I was an inspiration. Made her realize that... she's not a burn victim. She's a burn survivor. And I never thought of it that way. (exhales) You are so much stronger than you give yourself credit for. Going through all this in the public eye, it's been hard. But I think I can do some good. I think you can do whatever you set your mind to. ♪ ♪ (footsteps echoing) It smells good, Mom. What do we got? You got to be shitting me. Morning, Ron. - How do you take your eggs? - From you, I don't. Simone is making an effort, and I expect you to do the same. Yeah, well, she's probably gonna poison all of us. DEREK: If she wanted to kill us, she would've done it in our sleep already. RON: Hmm, great. One big happy family. VERONICA: We don't have anything to fear from Simone. And she doesn't from us. We're family. Sit. (scoffs) RON: Hope your boyfriend comes down those stairs next... him and I got some unfinished business. Jackson? You're not gonna see him again. That's over now. Sorry to hear that. He was smarter than I thought. Enough. Now, Derek? Where are we with the license for the Memphis tasting room? DEREK: It's coming. Slower than I'd like, but it'll happen. REBECCA: Maddie, can you stop by his place and see if he's there, I'm... I'm just really worried. Yeah, I-I've been, I've been calling. He's not picking up. (huffs) Thank you. Thank you, honey. Is everything okay? It will be. I'm just, I'm just trying to track down your brother. Have you talked to him? Not since last night when he showed up wasted and you threw him out. I'm sorry. That didn't come out right. I know that Jackson isn't easy. I just don't know what else to do. Maybe you've done all you can. Now it's time for him to figure it out. Maybe you're right. If I didn't know better, I would say you look... I look what? Happy. It looks good on you. You and Beau, are you...? I am not talking about him. But I do have something I need to tell you. I'm ready to get back to work. I want to perform again. You want to perform? (chuckles) I thought that you said that you needed more time. I can't change my mind? Uh, of course you can... I just figured that you would start working here at home. Record a new song. Performing, it... it brings up security concerns. If that's all I spent my time worrying about, I'd never leave this house. What prompted this, was it Beau? This isn't about him. This is about me. Well, I just don't think that you are ready for this. What happened? You were the one that wanted me back in the spotlight in the first place. I was wrong. I really need your support this time. (sighs) (pounding on door) Jackson, open up. (knocking) (muffled): Jackson, I swear to God today is not the day to do this to me. Open up! Come on! Jackson! I hear you! (rattling echoes) (groans) Maddie, what the hell? Oh, good, you're alive. Call Mom, tell her you're safe, so she can stop calling me. - I'll see you later. - Hold on. Where's the fire? Where you going? Um, let me think. Oh, right, I'm going to work. You should try it sometime. Well, hold on a sec, hold on a sec. What? Let me, let me, let me look at you. Have you been crying? I don't have time for this. Wait. (train horn blows in distance) Were you crying because of me? No. I can assure you I was not. Then what happened? Um, Tucker called off the wedding. Oh... (crying): He was having an affair. Oh, no... YOUNG TUCKER: Wait up, Anna! (echoing shouts, screaming) (birds chirping) Mom? Tucker. Hey. Your mom's okay. It's just a difficult day. For everyone. Go brush your teeth. Lorraine. How many drinks have you had already? LORRAINE: Well, I'm sorry I'm not like you. EVERETT: Come on. TUCKER: No. Don't go out there. EVERETT: It's 10:00 a.m., for God's sake. LORRAINE: I can't do this sober. EVERETT: And no more pills, either. You're scaring your son. Why didn't he save her? Tucker was there. Anna would've saved him. (breathing shakily) (laughs softly) It's usually me staring at those old things. It's nice to see Dad looking so happy. The last few years I was here, all we did was fight. Funny thing, though. You'd never know I lived here. I'm not in any of these. Not anywhere. Believe it or not, I didn't take them down. Your father did. After you left, he said it hurt too much to walk by you every day. That sounds like him. He was good at avoiding anything he didn't want to deal with. Remind you of anybody? By the way, thanks for cleaning up after breakfast this morning. You went above and beyond. You know I'm not buying your act. The good stepmother. Oh, it's okay. I'm not buying the good stepdaughter one, either. But at least we're talking. (door opens) Mom. You, uh, have a visitor. Clay? What a surprise to see you here. What can I do for you? We, uh, we need to talk. Sure. Let's go outside. Mr. Callaway. We haven't met. Simone Garland. Frank's daughter, Cora's goddaughter. Veronica must have - mentioned me. - She did. Uh, very sorry for your loss. Thanks. You as well. I'm sure you and my dad were close. He must have been quite a handful as a client. VERONICA: Uh, Clay, let's go have that chat. Not this time, son. Something funny? You really thought she would include you in everything. She does. My mistake. MADDIE: So what happened last night? Mom said you almost ran her over - with your truck. - No. I did not run Mom over with my truck. But we're not talking about me. Well, I'm done crying, so... Come on, let me at least act like a good brother. What did Mom have to say? - About Tucker? - Yeah. Mm, I haven't told her. I guess there's a part of me that doesn't really feel like it's real. What about you? Mom said it was worse than usual. Was it because of Simone? I met her. My firm represents her family. (whispers): I like her. (chuckles) Well, that's great, because she gave me the boot. (laughs softly) So she broke your heart and that gave you the excuse to almost drink yourself to death? Do-do you remember when I was being really nice to you, like, a minute ago? No, you're right. You're right, Jackson. It-it really is just the same old story with you, isn't it? Except this one. She... (exhales) She was different. She's... She's the kind of girl you write songs about. But not the kind of girl you'd stop drinking for? My God, I love you, Jackson... but I'm done being a broken record. I'm gonna go. Maybe take a shower. You stink. (door closes) (stops playing) (knocking on door) - Hey. - You busy? Not anymore. (laughs softly) What's going on? I just saw that you made an announcement online. You're planning to perform again? I was gonna tell you. Right. After you shared it with millions of followers. I was excited. I couldn't help myself. And I wanted to put it out there before anyone tried to change my mind. Okay, so when is it? Where's the show? I don't know. Like I said, I just made the decision. (sighs) Look, Ashley, I-I can't let you do this. It's not safe. I'm a performer. I'm in the public eye. I'll never truly be safe. - This is different and you know it. - Whoever did this wants me to be afraid. To hide away and stop living life, and I... I can't do it anymore. It's not like I'm gonna be there alone. You'll be there with me. Right? (exhales) Unless something's changed. Look, Ashley, I got a call. N-Nashville PD wants me back. They've cleared me - and said I could even make detective. - Mm. Okay. Wow. Just like that. After how they treated you? I'm not running into this blind. Mm. And nothing is official. The decision is still mine to make. And I would never leave you unless I knew you were safe and in good hands. Ashley? Seems like a no-brainer to me. Being a cop is your dream. Performing is mine. Which is why I'm gonna do this. I should get back to it. See you later. (sighs) (preacher speaking indistinctly) PREACHER: Throughout Anna's short life, she was surrounded by love, friends and family. When a child dies, we mourn both the life that was, and the life that might have been. "Is death the last sleep? No, it is the last and final awakening." - (Lorraine crying) - (footsteps approaching) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (gasps) (breathing heavily) (car door closes) Clay Callaway's office, please. (engine starts) Hi, this is Simone Garland. I'd like to set up a meeting with Clay. He'll know what it's about. Thanks. (knocking on door) ALLEN: Ms. Pruitt? - Sorry to bother you. There's someone here to see you. - Who is it? I... I don't have anything in my calendar. She said she had an appointment with Brendan. But he's still out, so... Uh, yeah. Of course. - Please, show her in. - Come on in. This is Ms. Peterson. This is Maddie Pruitt. Please, call me Rachel. Maddie. It's nice to meet you. Thanks for squeezing me in before lunch. Your office is amazing. Thank you. When you work as much as I do, it pays to be comfortable. - (chuckles) - How can I help you? Well, I last spoke with a colleague of yours. Brendan? - Mm-hmm. - I'm not sure if he told you about my situation. No. He did not. "Nashville's New and Notables." I'm impressed. It's heavy. MADDIE: So why don't we start from the beginning? Ms. Peterson? Please. Rachel. I did a stupid thing. My fiancé and I started a small business together. Interior design. The company's doing well, but... - we haven't been. - I understand. Did you and your fiancé sign any agreements? - Any contracts? - No. Problem is, we used my money. Stupid. I know. I wouldn't say stupid. Um... optimistic, maybe. You mean naive. That's what my sister calls me. Oh, she's the practical one. Two kids, married... I'm the dreamer. But you know, I think you have to be a little naive to get anywhere in life. Well, you have to trust people, right? There's always a risk. For instance, you have a fiancé. That's a beautiful ring, by the way. Thank you. When he popped the question, were you absolutely positive that it was him? I mean, 100% sure? Of course not. Because there are no real guarantees in life. Well, there are when you hire a good lawyer. (laughs softly) I hope so. You know, I hate to do this, but I haven't eaten anything all day. Do you think we could finish this over food? You know what? Um... I would, but I have a completely full schedule. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Brendan blows me off, and you are too busy. I get it. Rachel, um... I'm sorry. I will make time. I know a great place right around the corner. Thank you. (laughs softly) If I have a glass of wine, you won't tell my soon-to-be ex-fiancé, will you? Attorney-client privilege applies to everything. Including wine. What's going on? This just arrived for Miss Rose. Oh, shit. Who dropped it off? Package delivery service. Uh, arrived on their doorstep an hour ago. Okay, tell them we need any surveillance footage that they have now. ASHLEY: "You got lucky the first time. It won't happen again." There was no warning before the explosion. How do we know - that this is related? - We don't. That said, this represents a new threat level. ASHLEY: These are lovebirds. This is about me and you. Those photos of us are all over the Internet. Speculation about your love life... - and now a comeback tour... - Whoever did this sees you getting your life back, and they want to make sure that doesn't happen. Why does somebody hate me so much? - What did I do? - REBECCA: You did nothing. This is not your fault. Whoever sent this is sick. I'm gonna take it to the police. But in the meantime, do not leave the property. My guys can protect you better here. Okay? MADDIE: Oh, no, I shouldn't. I'm working. You're working for me. Stop worrying. So, Tucker. Very artsy name. (sighs) Yeah. Should have been my first warning. Trouble in paradise? - He cheated on me. - No, he did not. Okay, you are gorgeous and smart. You're like a dream woman. Why would he cheat on you? I don't know. Things were great when we first met. He was writing his first book. He was so creative, so interesting. Interested. You know, we just, we just clicked. So what changed? He started having trouble sleeping. Then trouble writing, and just became a vicious cycle. But you supported him. I mean, emotionally. Yeah. Of course. I mean, I-I believed in him. I... I loved the way his mind worked. The way he observed people. He just, he noticed their-their quirks, their patterns. Part fiancé, - part shrink? - Hmm. Yeah, sort of. But then the insomnia kicks in, and then it's like he's just a different person. Different how? Um... unhappy. Darker. It's like those powers of observation just kind of twist in on themselves and-and have nowhere to go. But you loved him anyway? Well... I think tortured artist runs in my family. Hmm. Look at me, I won't shut up about myself. We're supposed to be talking about you. Don't worry about it. I'm happy that we connected enough for you to feel comfortable sharing. (phone vibrates) Something wrong? It's about Brendan. Um... his wife is in my office. Oh, my God, I hope everything's okay. Yeah. Me, too. You know what? I'm gonna... I should probably go. - Oh, I've got it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Of course. - Oh. - Thank you. Next time it's on me. - (chuckles) - Um, let's-let's talk later. - Okay. GWEN: Thanks for stopping by. - Sure. - Be in touch. Did you get anything from her? Names of a few guys Dylan used to run with. Well, anyone you think might be involved? Or they might know who hired him to kill Ashley. What have you got? Shit. Yeah. At least they've given us - a heads-up this time. - Do you really think this is the same person as the bomber? It could be. I, uh, I'll get it to the lab, make sure it's expedited. - Thank you. Keep me in the loop. - Yeah. Got to get back to Ashley. Do you think that's a good idea? I mean, these are two dead lovebirds. (scoffs) No one's coming after me. Are you sure? I mean, you are Ashley Rose's new man. Whoever did this wants her to suffer. That makes you a target, too. I'm not the one that you need to be worried about right now. I'm just trying to help you. I know. So if you want to help, find out who sent that. ♪ ♪ I'm looking for a gig. MAN: Taking care of yourself these days? - You got it under control? - Yeah, I'm totally clean. I'm suited and booted, ready to roll. So, you're back in the program? I haven't, uh, done any meetings yet, - but I'm-I'm... - (line clicks) Monroe, it's Jackson. What's up? MONROE: Uh, Jackson...? Jackson Pruitt. ♪ ♪ (bottle opens, drink pouring) ♪ ♪ - It took so much courage to do this. - Damien. - What are you doing here? - DAMIEN: Oh, not much. Just planning the greatest comeback Nashville has ever seen. You're not gonna believe it. There's an opening at the Music City Auditorium - in two days. - It's fantastic timing. - I'm telling you, this was meant to be. - Ashley. You're not gonna perform, not with this new threat out there. Well, there's always gonna be threats. - We have a whole book full of them. - This is very different. Well, I'm different. And I'm not gonna let someone sending me a few birds - stop me from doing what I want. - Yeah? And what's gonna stop them from doing what they want? What would you like me to do? Every time there's a new threat, run and hide in here? I'm not doing that. Not anymore. Look... We'll be ready this time, okay? We'll have so much security, it'll be like Fort Knox. By the way, where is the bodyguard? We have to include him. Imagine it. Him in the wings. You onstage, singing to him. - (scoffs) That's not happening. - Come on. - The crowd will eat that up. True love conquering all. - Damien, this is a mistake. Let me be clear. We're doing this. And we're doing it my way. No gimmicks. No backup dancers. No pyrotechnics. Just me and my guitar. Okay? Okay. Whatever you want. Great. - Christine, I was just heading up to see you. - I couldn't wait. What's going on? It's Brendan. I haven't heard from him in two days. He's not answering my calls, and his assistant told me he hasn't been here, either. - I just assumed that he was out sick. - I was at a conference out of town. Then he stopped texting me back. I thought he was just mad at me again, but when I got back, he wasn't home. Now I'm thinking something's really wrong. Has Tucker mentioned anything? Tucker? I... Wh-Why would he have anything to do with it? Uh, this is Brendan's. It mirrors his phone, so it shows all of his texts. The last one he sent was to Tucker. Oh, my God. Christine, I had no idea. I mean, they can't stand each other. Who is Olivia? I'm not sure. Can you call Tucker? See if he knows anything? I tried him but couldn't reach him. Yeah, of course. (line rings) TUCKER: Hi, you've reached Tucker. - I'm not available right now. - It's going straight to voice mail. Okay, I'm gonna find Tucker, and I will call you as soon as I hear anything. - Okay? It's gonna be okay. - Okay. Okay.

I can't sleep without her. Give me the fucking doll. Let me tell you something. Anna is dead. And she is never coming back. Don't you ever do anything like this again.

So we can really talk. And so no one else can hear. This way. So, Miss Garland. Seems to me we helped you out of a little jam yesterday. (chuckles) Is there something more you'd like us to do? This isn't about me. It's about you and my stepmother. I know about the affair. Here we go. Cora knew about it, too. She was murdered because she had photos of the two of you. Photos my dad had taken. You know, I'd be real careful making accusations like that. You're gonna get yourself into some trouble. I don't think you're a murderer. I wouldn't be here if I did. At the house today, you were scared. I think you got used. You were sleeping with Veronica, and you did her a favor. You changed the trust, but that's it. You don't have any proof. And if you did, you wouldn't be here right now. Maybe the police will believe you and not me. Public opinion will be different. All it takes is one story these days, and they all start coming out. You know how it goes. (sighs) Fine. Have it your way. Wait. No. All I know is that Veronica couldn't have killed Frank that night. 'Cause she was with me. The police know. She just didn't want the boys finding out about us. I'll give you tonight to tell your wife on your terms. Tomorrow, I want the original copy of the trust. If not, I go public. It's your call.
