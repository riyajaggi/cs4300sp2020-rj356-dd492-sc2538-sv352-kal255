 Previously on Tell Me a Story... - You new? - Yeah. Just moved here. You make a great first impression. I'm sitting next to you. What is this place? Club of the moment. - I'm Nick. - Hi, Nick. Hi, everyone. My name is Nick Sullivan. Let's keep it casual. Call me Nick.

 Got a friend in from out of town. Party at his hotel. - Where's the party? - You're the party. You're taking his money? What's going on? No, Dan... Shut up! Chill out! What's going on? Why didn't you call for help? I called you! Wipe down anything you touched. We're gonna go. Are you up for this? 'Cause Sam didn't want to use you.

 I told him, "Hey, don't worry about Eddie." - "He's sober now." - When was I sober? I fucking lied. Plan was to get married last year, and be pregnant this year, and that was the plan. The world is falling apart around us! But if you don't want to marry me, you got to let me know. You're all I want. This world is so screwed up, it messes with my head. - Please marry me. - Yes. Everybody on the floor now! Put your gun down! What... No, no, no. We are the best part of me. There is not a day I want to wake up without you. On the floor or you die! Put your gun down now! No. No, no. No, no, no! No! All I have are three men in pig masks to go with the 500 pig masks at the protest across the street. The guard got a shot off. Bullet caught one of our perps in the shoulder, through and through. You find the slug? Techs are trying to pull DNA. They're total pros. They ignored the displays, went straight for the safe. What'd they get? Rough diamonds. Manager says, uh, could be up to $6 million with the right cutter. Fuck me. Mr. Evans? My name's Renee Garcia. I'm a detective with the Homicide Squad. I'm sorry for your loss. If it's okay, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Where are they taking her? The medical examiner's office. - It's part of the process, sir. - Coming through. Tell you what, we'll have an officer drive you. We can do this later. This is bad. This is really bad. You said nobody'd get hurt. Would you shut up? He killed the guard. He killed that woman. That's two people dead. - Ah, fuck. - How's the shoulder? I'm not gonna lie, it hurts. - He needs a hospital. - No hospital. - Let me look at it. - Are you kidding me? He's bleeding out. Eddie, Eddie, it's okay. No hospital. Bullet went right through you. Why'd you kill those people, huh? We're going to prison. Hey. Relax. Okay? Nobody's going to prison. But you got to be cool. You understand me? Those people got shot 'cause your tweakin' ass lost it - and I had to step in. - No, no, no, no, no. Don't put this on me. I didn't do shit. We all in this together. Take a deep breath. I want my money. I owe people money. When do I get my money? I'll reach out to the contact, make the exchange, then you'll get it. Fuck. Do something about your brother. He'll be good. I'll make sure. Eddie, come on, you got to calm down, okay? Yeah. Get my texts? I've been looking for you all day. Have you spoken to him yet? How far did you go with him last night, anyway? You slept with the English teacher? - Substitute teacher. - Oh, hon, Mr. Hiller fell and cracked his ass. Old bones don't heal. He could be out all year. Please, don't tell anyone. Tweeted, Snapped, Instagram, YouTube, Christian Mingle. - It's everywhere. - Laney. I'm joking. I'm the new girl, okay? It's the last thing I need right now. I got you. Oh, shit. Ms. Powell. Call me. Alone in the gym. - Is this really a good idea? - You lied to me. No, I didn't. You did not tell me you were a minor. Well, you didn't ask. That club was 21 and over. There was a reasonable expectation that you were of age. - You sound like a lawyer. - Well, I'm gonna need one. What are you talking about? Don't worry about it. What happened last night was an accident. An accident? An unexpected occurrence. Is that more lawyerly? This is not a joke. I'm gonna get fired, and I should be fired. And arrested and put in prison. You're not going to prison. I googled already. The legal age of consent in New York is 17. I'm a teacher, you are a student. This will ruin me. I just started my career. I'm done. I'm done! Look... we hooked up. We didn't know. It was a one-time thing, and now it's done. Okay, I'm not gonna tell anybody, and if you don't, then all will be good. What about your friend? She-she saw us together. She's not gonna tell anyone either. Nick, you need to chill. Seriously. His name is Dan Simmons. Billy said he's from out of town. He's from Brooklyn. Indictments for money laundering, racketeering. A Postarticle says that he was acquitted on a murder charge back in 2014. This guy was a piece of shit. You knew nothing about this guy? I-I didn't... I told you. Billy hooked up with him a couple of times. I didn't know him. - I thought it was gonna be a party. - Jesus, Gabe. He didn't even have an iPhone. It's just, like, a cheap prepaid one. Yeah, well, that's what criminals use so they can't be traced. Don't turn it on. You just finished saying it can't be traced. I could be wrong; do I look like a criminal to you? Goddamn it, Gabe. I'm sorry, Hannah. I shouldn't have called you, it's just... I-I-I did it. I pushed him, he fell, and... He was alive one second, and then... Have you heard from Billy? Nothing. That piece of shit. I never liked that asshole. We need to find him. If the police connect you to that hotel, you guys need to tell the same story. He's a friend. I trust him. He's a fucking drug addict. You can't trust drug addicts. I'm not lying to you, Hannah. I told you everything. How come it's not on the news? Three robbers who were wearing pig masks... They had to find his body by now. They were also worn at the nearby protest near City Hall. Police have no comment whether or not... I'm going home. I'm gonna see if he's there. - He's supposed to work tonight. - I'm coming with you. You don't have to. I can take care of it now. You should just stay out of it. Yeah, right. Come on, let's go. ...whether or not the two were related, but they're hopeful more information comes to light in the following days of this investigation. Anything you can tell me will help. We have footage of the robbery, but of course, there's always something the cameras don't catch. Did anything stand out to you? Tattoos, a scar, something they were wearing? Uh, it all happened so fast. You're gonna be playing it out in your head for a long time. That's, that's just how it goes. If you remember anything that you think might help us, my cell's on that. Can I see her? I wish I didn't feel this way. I wish I didn't hate this world so much. I'm sorry. I can't let you touch her. Not until the autopsy's complete. It's all my fault, you know? She wasn't ready, but I pushed her. I wanted to get married, have a family. But she was right. This world has no place for that anymore. Green eyes. The one the guard grabbed. His eyes were green. Glassy. He was uh... you know, like, manic? Or on drugs. - It's not much. - It's something. Babe, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Dad said you didn't show up to the site today. Where were you? Uh, I was checking out the Jackson place. All day? So what did your sack-of-shit brother do now? He's using again, Shell. Hmm. Doesn't explain why you're sneaking in through the back. Or whatever you did to your arm. Yeah, I went by his place this morning, and... Eddie was spun out of his skull. He fucking jumped me. Oh, babe. You okay? Yeah. I-I'm fine. I'll be fine. He got me good, though. Yeah. That looks bad, babe. It's fine. Okay... hey, look. I know he's blood. But you have worked too hard to turn your life around. He's gonna drown. Don't let him take you with him. Why are you in my room? I was rearranging the closet. I thought you might need some space if you ever want to unpack. Right. How was school? It was fine. It was school. Talkative. Would you do me a favor? You get those garment bags for me? These are good. Don't touch that. It was a compliment. They're just sketches. They don't, they're nothing. Well, they don't look like nothing to me. Can I have it back now, please? These really are good. You're very talented. Just like your mom. Thanks. Well. All yours. Police are now saying the three men disguised as protestors held up the jewelry store downtown. We're picking her father up from the airport tomorrow. - What about his parents? - They're in Europe. Still waiting for them to call me back. Are the news vans still outside? Yeah, it's crazy. I can't believe this is happening. He still hasn't eaten. Jordan? Can I get you something? I'm fine. Thanks. It's probably Tim. Hey. I hope it's okay I stopped by. Everyone at the restaurant sends their best. Look, I know I've only been back in the city five minutes, but, uh, I'm here. Whatever you need. What do I do? You lost Abby. You know this. How do I do it? There is no way to do it. I wish I had better news, but you just have to survive it. It will become bearable, but for now, you just have to hurt your way through it. And it will hurt. Hey, what can I get ya? How you doing? Not good, babe. Your phone. I made several calls, like you said. Alibi should be good. What the hell, Billy? Why didn't you call me back? You remember my sister? Yeah, what the hell is she doing here? I know what happened. I know you two left a dead man in your hotel room. - Yeah. The one your brother killed. - It was an accident. Okay, if the police come calling, you two went to his room and partied. When you both left, he was alive. That's all you know. You got that? - I didn't kill anybody... - You fucking left my brother in there to take the fall. It was not like... When you both left, he was alive. - Can you get that in your head? - Jesus. Yeah. And if you come near my brother again, I will fucking kill you. You do not want to fuck with me. I mean, I feel bad for the guy. Yeah, I never told him who I was, so technically, it's not his fault. - Yeah. - Just promise, you won't say anything to anyone. I would never... I could get into so much trouble. ...as long as I get an A in English. Not an A-plus, 'cause that would be suspect, but a solid A. - I'll see what I can... - You don't want to go in there. Mandatory assembly on cyberbullying. Is there an alternative? There's always an alternative. No. No way. I can't get caught skipping again. I'll be suspended. Come on, Laney. I'll go. Where are we going? Someone's living their best life. Let's do it. Ugh, I hate you people. Still raining? I was thinking maybe pasta tonight. It's easy. Beth. Ah! Fuck. Fuck. I pieced together their exit using surveillance feeds and footage taken from the protestors. But I lose them in the crowd every time. Same goes for the approach. Hold it. Right there. Upper right. Punch in on that. Fresh kicks. Retro High OGs with the black toe. I have two boys. I saw those shoes earlier. Bring back up the Hudson Street footage. Just the stuff we got from the protestors along the edge of the crowd, right before the pigs entered the store. There. That one. Zoom in? Save our kids. No more gun violence... Stop. Now show me those two images side by side. Same pants, same shoes. Is that enough for facial recognition? Uh, could be. Let me run with it. This place is insane. What do your parents do? Well, Mom's in London with her bichon Bitsy, and Dad's usually in Europe or the Middle East peddling weapons of mass destruction. As dads do. Oh, he's not kidding. His father's a military contractor. Cocktails, anyone? - I'll make them. - Me. So are you and Laney, like, a thing? Just friends. Like you and I are gonna be, I hope. You don't want to stare at that one too long. Not high. Why? It's Dubuffet. You know, back in the day, Dubuffet was known as enfant terrible to the Paris art world. Isn't that what your friends call you, Ethan? Dubuffet was unconventional. He was an outsider, very elusive. Elusive. Like you. Some big mystery. Something happened back in Oakland. People don't just up and move in the middle of their senior year. Not everyone's an over-sharer, Laney. Don't hate because I own my shit. Laney's dad's an alcoholic. And a cheater. And my mom refuses to kick his ass out, even though he basically has another family. Told you. Over-sharer. At least I never went to prison. Not prison. Juvenile detention ranch. I milked cows for the summer. And just so you know, my record's been expunged. See? We own our shit. Fine. What do you want to know? What happened in California? What makes you so guarded? And sad. There's something uniquely sad about you. So? What happened? Is that a hot tub? Armed robbery, aggravated assault, possession. Think you could tell me what this is about? 'Cause I want to help you guys, but if I'm late for work... You and your friends robbed a jewelry store yesterday, murdered two innocent people in the process. What the fuck are you talking about? This guy, security guard, he had three kids. And her. Her name was Beth. She ran a nonprofit. She was buying her wedding ring. Yeah, look, I did time, yeah, but I got my act together now, so... Surveillance footage puts you and your little piggy mask 20 yards from the store you robbed. This could be anybody. Facial recognition says it's you. Don't worry. I know you're not the shooter. That's the other guy. And seeing as how your arm's not in a sling, I'm guessing this one's you. The three of you went for the diamonds. Uncut, easy to move. At 30 cents on the dollar, it's a huge score. Maybe even worth the risk. Except now you're looking at murder charges. You got the wrong guy. What do you think? I think it was a nice try, but we have to let him go. Facial recognition's less than 60 and he has an alibi. It'll never hold up. Did you talk to his girlfriend? She says he was with her all day. I'm not buying it. See if Judge Warner will give us the okay to ping his cell. How soon can we get witnesses down here for a lineup? A lineup? They were wearing masks. Just do it, Glen. My, what a lovely tattoo you have. Does that cool talk ever really work for you? You're tough. Your dad's place is so great. Are you guys close? Nah, I hate the guy. Your mom, too, or is that just the bichon? You like asking all the questions, don't you? It's your way of hiding in plain sight. I'm not hiding. You know... when you have a connection with someone, it helps to unload. Share your deepest, darkest secrets. What makes you think we have a connection? What makes you think we don't? Not sure if I mixed these right... Um, if y'all are having a moment, I can dipset. It's not like that. Really. Come here. Get in. We're just playing a game. What kind of game? Get in. I'll show you. Kayla plus Ethan. Plus Laney. Minus Kayla... equals Ethan and Laney. On the floor or you die. Look at his body. Listen to his voice. Do you recognize him? Number three. Step forward. State the phrase you were given. On the floor or you die. Number four, your turn. Number four. - On the floor or you die. - Wait. Now can you have him do that again? Number four, once more. Louder this time. On the floor or you die. That's him. How certain are you? 100%. Well, this is yummy. Feel free to bring food home every night. I'm... I'm loving this. Colleen, why are you single? - Kayla. - No, it's okay. I'm-I'm single by choice. 'Cause you're, like, super hot. And we should find you a man. When was the last time you got... Enough, Kayla. Well, uh, I do date, but at the moment, there's, uh, there's nobody special. Well, there should be. I mean, you should have, like, a whole slam list. You're smokin'. Goddamn it, Kayla, what are you on? Hmm? The school called. I know you didn't go today. You didn't go to school? Where were you? Hmm? Who were you with? - My new friends. - Well, that was quick. Second day of school, you've already found the wrong crowd. Yeah, well, there's no right crowd. It's starting again, Kayla, the skipping school, the drugs, the staying out all night. I won't stand for it. Yeah? What are you gonna do about it? We moved here to start over, Kayla. No, you moved here to start over. I was fine back in Oakland. You were a disaster in Oakland and you're doing the same thing here. I mean, it would make your mother so sick - to see you fucked up like this. - Fuck you! You don't know what Mom would say because you fucking hated her. Okay, can we stop with the fucks for five fucking minutes? Fuck you talking about? I didn't hate your mother. You treated her like shit and you don't think I noticed? - Your marriage was a joke. - You don't know what you're talking about. - That's not true. - And you know it, too. - None of that is true. - You know what? I'm done. I am so fucking done. I'm sorry. I didn't handle that well. I, uh, I will do better. I promise. Kayla. Kayla, hey. Wait. Wait, wait. Just... give her space. Gabe, will you open? Gabe, it's Hannah. Gabe! No no. Goddamn it, Gabe. Gabe. Okay, can-can you hear me? Gabe! Gabe! Come on! Come on. Get it all out. Get it all out. Get it all out. Hey. Go on. Did you get him? What are you still doing here, Mr. Evans? Number four, did you arrest him? None of the other witnesses could identify the same suspect you did. Okay, well, then the other witnesses are wrong. Hey, look. It's okay, we're working on it, sir. Don't do that. Don't-don't-don't placate me. Okay? Number four, he was there. He and his friends, they murdered Beth. And what, you're just gonna let him go? It's not just the lineup. His girlfriend confirmed his alibi. So even if I wanted to charge him, my captain would never sign off. Okay, well, then get your captain down here. I'll talk to him. You need to investigate, find his friends, do your fucking jobs! Listen to me, Mr. Evans. Jordan, you say that's the guy? Then we'll keep looking into him, you have my word. But I don't make arrests that don't hold up in court. Understand? Jordan. Gabe. Gabe. Hey. I'm sorry. Don't be. It was an accident, right? Gabe? I'm not like you. I can't just move on. I... I can't run away. What are you talking about? I didn't run away. Dad got sick and you left. I had to take care of him... alone. I was 13, Hannah. I enlisted for us, for you. Someone had to pay for his medical bills. We needed money. Everything changed when he died. No. Everything changed when Mom walked out on us. I was six, I barely remember. Tell me the truth: did you try to kill yourself? Not this time. But there were nights I would do so many drugs I just didn't care if I woke up. But this wasn't that. I-I just wanted to sleep. Just... shut it all out for a while. I should've called more, - tried harder. - It doesn't matter. I'm here now. The body of a Brooklyn resident, recently identified as Dan Simmons has been found... Turn it up. ...after Dan Simmons' body was discovered earlier this afternoon in the Hudson River. Authorities suspect foul play due to Simmons' criminal history. - An investigation... - Somebody moved his body. Who? Why would they do that? ...the river for any leads or evidence. What are you drinking? Sorry? What are you drinking? Scotch. Thank you. Everything go all right today? So far. Oh, shit. I thought we had an agreement. We do and we will. I can't have you coming over here like this, okay? - Shh. - No. Do you know how much trouble I'm gonna be in? - Just one more time. - Kayla. No one will know. Oh, my God, you're high. Um... I know what you need. I put a little milk in it. Hope you like it. Low-key amazing. What? What's going on? Something happened? Or we can just sit here in silence. Things are a little upside down right now. How so? I'm a little fucked up, if you haven't picked up on that. I read your school file. I have access, and I was, um... I was curious about you, who you were. Did it tell you how damaged I am? No. But it did say you just moved here from Oakland and that your mom died recently. 14 months ago. How'd she die? She wrapped her car around a telephone pole one night. She was coming home late from work. It wasn't raining. She wasn't drinking, wasn't speeding. It was just one of those things that happens in the world sometimes, you know. One tiny thread pulled in the universe that triggers a cosmic hell of human suffering. I'm so sorry. I... Tell me about her. Your mom. She was the most amazing human being I've ever known. You know, and-and we looked just alike, so I was amazing by proxy. Or that's what I used to tell her. But it's why my dad can't stand to look at me. Because he just sees her. Which is fair, because when I look at him, I just see that she's not there. Hey, this-this, um... this will get better. Yeah, I'd love an ETA on that. Because I really hate missing her. About fucking time. This better be an emergency. I got pulled in for a lineup today. Over what? Oh, just some bullshit. What the fuck do you think? "Over what?" Tell me what happened. I beat the lineup. That's not the problem. Listen to me, Mitch. The guy from the store... the one whose girl got killed, he followed me to the bar tonight. Eddie, are you fucked up? You're not listening to me. He was there. I don't know how he found me, but he did. He fucking knows who I am. All right. Calm down. - You're just being paranoid. - I'm not. It was him. He's onto us. I served him a fucking drink tonight. Eddie. Eddie. Everything's gonna be fine. But you cannot fall apart on me. It was him. And we'll deal with it. All right? Now go to bed. Get some sleep. Good night, Eddie.
