 You don't think I should be here, do you? Well, since you asked, no. Not while you don't know where your wife is. He slipped out of the pub the night that Sarah disappeared. But he was with you all night. Wasn't he? Not all night. I covered for him. Do you really want to go to prison for perverting the course of justice? I'll sort it.

 I need to know where you went to. - Why's David lying to me? - I followed him. I think I know why the detective inspector is being so secretive. I think he's got another woman. She's got a kid. What, David's? I know exactly where you were. If you two don't get off my back, you can wave goodbye to your jobs and wave goodbye to your pensions. Maguire. Don't bother coming back! Callum. Somebody help me!

 Callum. Callum, Callum, Callum. Our victim is a Marcus Maguire. -Really? -You know him? Marcus Maguire was a gangster. Drugs, extortion, vice. His son Callum's been shot, too. So this could be the opening salvo of what? Some sort of turf war? It's got gangland hit written all over it. I'm sorry to tell you that your father-in-law, Marcus Maguire, has also been shot. Is -- Is he... He died at the scene. We'll need your clothes. And your phone. For forensic purposes. It's ballsy. Shooting the Maguires in broad daylight. Any of your famous insights? Well, whoever did this certainly knew their routine. So someone with inside knowledge. Well, we can't rule that out. What is this place, anyway? It's an exclusive members-only casino. Who does he think he is? -Oi, you can't do that! -Viv, I'll deal with him. It's Adrian Cook. He owns this place. Fine with me. I'll check on the CCTV. Mr. Bradford. Social media is going crazy. Has someone really been shot? Marcus Maguire. You're joking. Not just Marcus. His son Callum, too. On his doorstep. -Are they... -Yep. Both dead. Shall we continue this conversation over here? Thank you. We'd only been married seven months. Have you got any idea who did this? I know exactly who did it. Adrian Cook. Callum and his dad, they turned his failing casino 'round. Then he decides he wants them out. How did Callum and his dad react to that? They made him a counteroffer. To buy him out. What was Cook's reaction? I think the exact words were "over my dead body." They were great guys. Really, really great guys. What was your relationship with the Maguires? They managed my casino and my amusement arcades. Do you know, I was meant to meet Marcus here at 8:00. I texted him to say I couldn't. You've had a lucky escape. We can arrange for protection for you. No. No. No, thank you, Mr. Bradford. I can look after myself. I'll get my sergeant to take your statement. And any help I can give you in your inquiries, please, please don't hesitate to ask. Has anyone told Gloria? Who's Gloria? Marcus' girlfriend. She's pregnant. Have you got her contact details? Yeah. Is that the practice nurse? No, it's the police. I'm here to see Gloria Tanner. Yeah, come up. She's losing the baby. I could tell something was wrong last night. And you are? Dean Casey. Gloria's neighbor and friend. Hello, Gloria. I'm Trainee Detective Constable Billie Fitzgerald. Is there any way I can help? It's the baby. I've just spoken to HQ. To say they're nervy is an understatement. The worst-case scenario is that this thing escalates. -Rob. -Right. We've got a number of images of the scooter and its rider. We've checked the index... ...and the make or model don't match, so we're sure that the plates are stolen. Victimology? This is Marcus Maguire. 54 years old. Served time for fraud, money laundering, armed robbery and assault, and occasioning actual bodily harm. -Nice. -What about the son? Uh, Callum Maguire. 31 years old. Better behaved than his dad. Or better at not getting caught. The National Crime Agency had Callum under observation a while back. They were sure that he was running a major drugs operation. But they couldn't find anything to stick. Callum's widow, Alice, is convinced that Adrian Cook is behind the murders. I've checked. Adrian Cook doesn't have a police record. That's because his superpower is getting other people to do his dirty work. Never managed to put him away. Not for lack of trying. Where was he at the time of the shooting? He claims he was visiting his mother. I'm still waiting for the care home to call me back. I've got to deal with this. If these murders are down to Adrian Cook, let's finally wipe that smile off his smug face. How's the detective inspector been with you? -Fine. -Yeah, me too. Do you reckon he's forgiven us? Yeah, if we toe the line. It feels like I'm back on probation again. Yeah, it's Detective Inspector David Bradford. Well, when will he be in? Yeah, he's got my number. I haven't told Gloria. That the Maguires have been murdered. Don't worry. That's my job. How did you know about that? Social media. I used to be in the police. All me mates are talking about it. Did you know the victims? Yeah. From my time in the police. I couldn't believe it when Gloria introduced Marcus Maguire as her new boyfriend. Not a fan, then? Well, the nurse couldn't find a heartbeat. I'm so sorry. What are you even doing here, anyway? There's something I need to tell you. Something distressing. It's your boyfriend, Marcus. Oh, what's he done now? I'm so sorry to tell you, but Marcus Maguire was killed. Earlier this morning. What happened? He was shot dead. When I got to Gloria Tanner's place, she was miscarrying, and when I told her Marcus was dead, she just laughed. For ages. And she said it was the shock, but I'm not so sure. -What do you mean? -I just got this strong feeling there's a load she's not telling me. How are you getting on? Oh, Adrian Cook's alibi checks out. He was with his elderly mother when the murders took place. Doesn't mean he's not behind them. -Indeed. -That was the tech unit. They found something interesting on Marcus Maguire's phone. You can take your drugs and stick 'em. Do anything like that again, and I'll kill you! So, who is that? Subscriber is Afrim Tanner. Aged 17, same address as Gloria. Must be her son. Gloria didn't mention she has a son. So, he called Marcus last night? At 11:23. Do you want the icing on the cake? Afrim Tanner is the registered owner of a red scooter. Here you go. Thanks. You used to be a policeman. What have you heard? It was someone on a scooter. Shot the pair of 'em. Do you know what? I need to find Afrim. Why? Because I'm worried he's done something really stupid. So, what you gonna do? About the boss? Well he's effectively blackmailing us. He's saying if we don't stop asking questions about where he was the night his wife went missing, -then we're off the team. -It only matters where he was if you think he'd do harm to Sarah, and I don't. Do you? No. There we are, then. Look, you concentrate on the scan, and I'll find your son. Thank you. I don't know what we'd do without you. Thanks. That looks like our guy there. That's him. Stop! Police! Stop! All units. Red scooter. Failed to stop for police. Rider wanted on suspicion of murder. Your mum's worried about ya. Look, she needs you, mate. She's lost the baby. I've really messed up. Intelligence suggests that Marcus Maguire was supplying half the spice in West London. He used a network of kids on scooters. My guess is that Afrim Tanner was one of them. I still don't understand how the two of you lost him. - Okay, thanks. - We got half the police in London looking for him. You can call off the search. He's just walked in downstairs. "I wish to give the following prepared statement to police about the drugs found outside my home address. I admit I was in possession of them. I believe them to be spice. I found them by some bins on Packwell Avenue. I kept them because I thought I would use them myself and sell them to my friends. I know that this is wrong, and I apologize. No one else was involved in this matter." When was the last time you saw Marcus Maguire? Can we stick to possession of drugs? We are. This is connected. Look, I'm here 'cause Dean told me to fess up to the drugs. If this is about what went down with Marcus and Callum... Settle down. Afrim, what did I tell ya? I'm not a killer. You can take your drugs and stick 'em. Do anything like that again, and I'll kill you! Have you been selling drugs for Marcus Maguire? We'll ask the questions, thank you, Mr. Casey. Well, have you? For the tape. Yes. Why were you so angry with Marcus last night? 'Cause of what he did to my mum. He punched her in the belly. It's why she lost her baby. Tell me, Afrim. How did you get here? Dean gave me a lift. Why? Haven't you heard? The person that killed Marcus and Callum Maguire was riding a scooter. Red. No. Just like yours. I -- It wasn't me. - It wasn't me. - Where were you between the hours of 7:00 and 9:00 this morning? What's this got to do with the drugs? I think the voicemail proves that the two inquiries are linked. So, where were you between the hours of 7:00 and 9:00 this morning? I-I went for a walk. I-I needed to clear my head. It wasn't me. I didn't kill them. Adrian Cook's just been in a car crash. Someone tried to run him off the road. -How is he? -He's alive. Good. I wouldn't want him getting off that easily. He's been taken to hospital. I'm heading over there now. I'll come with you. Been through the wars, Mr. Cook? How observant. Some maniac tried to run me off the road. My car is a write-off. Oh, we're very sorry to hear that. Can you describe the vehicle? Yes. A white 4x4. -Any idea who was driving? -Uh, no. And you're sure it was a targeted attack? 100%. Have you any reason to believe that this incident is connected to the murders of Marcus and Callum Maguire? How would I know that? Why don't you just go and do your jobs and find out who just tried to kill me?! Okay, don't you worry, Mr. Cook. We're all over it. Don't fancy a spare rib, Viv? -Vivienne. -What about the scooter? Um, we can track it by CCTV... to Lorimer Gardens, and then it just disappears. So the killer stashed it somewhere. Yeah, I'm gonna head down to Lorimer Gardens, see if I can find a possible dump site. Rob Brady. Okay, cheers. Alice Maguire's been arrested for dangerous driving in her white 4x4. And the car's got extensive frontal damage. Attempted grievous bodily harm with a car as a weapon is a serious offense. What were you thinking, Alice? I told you Adrian Cook killed my husband. And you people have done nothing about it. Yeah, well, Mr. Cook has an alibi for the time of the shootings. Of course he has an alibi. That's how he operates. Look, if we find any evidence that Adrian Cook ordered the murder of your husband, we'll make sure he gets sent down. For life. What we don't need is you taking the law into your own hands. We had a fight. Callum and I. The last thing I said to him... I told him not to bother coming back. What was the fight about? - Where's Afrim? - Still in custody. I think they're gonna charge him. Possession with intent to supply Class "A" drugs. How are you? I thought you were gonna help him. I was trying to. They seem to think he killed Marcus and Callum. What?! No! Hello, Gloria. How was the scan? It just confirmed what I already knew -- The baby's gone, and I've got to wait for nature to take its course. I'm just -- I'm just worried about my son. There's no way Afrim had anything to do with the murders. Your son hasn't been arrested for murder. But I would like to talk to you about something Afrim's told us. Let's go across the hall. Just give me a moment, Gloria. You were in the job. -Maybe you can help me. -Anything. You said you were worried about the baby last night. Yeah. I knocked about 8:00 to see if Gloria needed anything. She was feeling uncomfortable then. Did she tell you what had happened with Marcus? She was in a terrible state. And did you stay with Gloria after that? -Yeah. -How long for? All night. And all morning? Till you turned up. Actually, there's somewhere I really need to be. Okay. I'll get someone to run Gloria home. Thanks. Uh, tell Gloria I'll catch her later. When we spoke to Afrim, he told us that Marcus assaulted you yesterday. Mm. I told Marcus that I was pregnant. I thought that he'd be happy. I even thought that he'd ask me to marry him. But it turns out he had a vasectomy 10 years ago, so the baby couldn't have been his. Is Gloria's baby alright? I can't comment on that. She's lost it, hasn't she? Was it Marcus' fault? Marcus, he... He punched me. So hard...in the belly. I'm sorry. Who was the biological father? I was carrying Callum's baby. Callum told me the truth last night. That he had a one-night stand with Gloria. We'd been trying for a baby. Talking about getting tests done. Clearly it wasn't Callum who had the problem. Were you, um... Were you happy before the baby stuff? Yeah, most of the time. We had a laugh. Callum could be so thoughtful... ...and so loving. Nobody else saw that side to him. Do you think he deserved to die like that? Nobody deserves to die like that. Look, whoever killed your husband decided to take the law into their own hands. And that goes against everything that I believe in. There's something else. I think Callum and his dad were shot with their own gun. When I went to the casino to lay flowers, I checked where Callum kept it hidden. Where was that? In the bin store. But it wasn't there. The only other person that knew about the gun was Adrian Cook. Do you mind if I ask you one more thing? No. Was Dean at your place all last night? Yeah. Yeah, till about 6:00 this morning. Then he went home for a shower and to get something to eat. -How long for? -Oh, I don't know. A couple of hours. Maybe more. He got back around 9:00. And that's when he insisted on calling the practice nurse. He's a sweetheart like that. Lovely. Yeah, this is Detective Sergeant Vivienne Cole. I'd like to request some bolt cutters. I reckon I've worked out where the murder weapon came from. -How come? -Alice Maguire told me her husband and his dad kept a gun stashed in the bin store of the casino. It's a 9-millimeter handgun. I've spoken to the lab. The ballistics match. So they were shot with their own gun. That's what Alice thinks. I spoke to the intelligence unit. A couple of nights ago, Marcus Maguire threw out a regular punter for being drunk. According to the bouncers, he ended up in a heap on the pavement outside. Totally humiliated. That punter was ex-Detective Constable Dean Casey. Dean Casey lied to me. About where he was at the time of the killings. I spoke to a colleague who worked with Detective Constable Casey a few years back. Rumor had it he was strongly advised to take early retirement. Otherwise, he'd be facing a discipline investigation. Into what? He was caught accessing the Police National Computer. Apparently, it was the final confirmation of what was long suspected. -Which was? -He was helping out his mate. Adrian Cook. So they know each other? They go way back. I've checked. Dean's been a member of that casino for years. Adrian wanted rid of the Maguires, but he'd never get his own hands dirty. So he manipulated Dean. But how? Money? Maybe Dean had gambling debts. I think he did it for love. He's in love with Gloria. It's written all over his face. David Bradford. Yeah, tell him I'll be right down. Let's track down Dean Casey. Before he shoots someone else. I'm assuming this isn't good news. -Thanks for letting me know. -Thank you. Rob. I've found the scooter. There isn't a single print on it. Whoever it was knew what he was doing. Like an ex-policeman? Gloria's friend, Dean Casey -- It turns out him and Adrian Cook are old mates. -Interesting. -He also lied to Billie about where he was at the time of the shootings. Now he's gone AWOL. Hello? It's only me. Key's supposed to be for emergencies only, Dean. I didn't want you getting up to answer the door. How you doing? Yeah, I'm okay. I just wish the police would let Afrim come home. Well, they're only doing their jobs. He was selling drugs. -I bought some food. -Oh. No, I really don't feel like anything. Can't find the boss. He was talking to a D.C.I. earlier from the missing persons team. I haven't seen him since. Well, you don't think his wife's been found dead? Surely he would have told us. What, us? We're hardly his favorite people. Who is it? 0800. Just a cold call. Right. Detective Constable Rob Brady. Alright, thanks. Dean Casey's car's just turned up at his address. He lives in the same block as Gloria Tanner. He could be armed. Okay, Billie, get the kit. -Yep. -We should run this by the detective inspector first. Yeah, if we knew where he was. Afrim is gonna be going mad locked up in that place. He'll be fine. They'll charge him for the drugs offense, and then they'll bail him to return. They think that he killed Marcus and Callum. They haven't got any evidence against him. -They can't have. -And how do you know? Look, I just do. I just think that me and Afrim need to get out of London. Yeah, not a bad idea. I've been thinking about it meself. I've been getting on with his dad a lot better. We could just get over to Albania and spend some proper family time together, you know. What's going on? Dean? That's his car. Ground floor, number 23. - Break it down. - Armed police! Stay where you are! Do not move. We're clear! Do not move! - We're clear. - Right. I was a good cop, you know. The thing is, to be effective, you gotta bend the rules. Otherwise, there's no stopping the likes of Marcus Maguire. What? I did it for you. You did what? Have a look at these. So he's got nothing left to lose. Let me tell them that you're here and give yourself up. -No. -You're going to prison, Dean. -No, I'm not. -You're a killer! Do you think you're any better than Marcus and Callum? 'Cause you're not. You're not. And our Afrim's been going through hell today -because of you. -I'm sorry about that. I just grabbed the first scooter I saw. I didn't even notice it was like his. Gloria? It's Trainee Detective Constable Fitzgerald. Are you okay? I got a gun. You don't make a sound. I'll kill you both if you don't send her away. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Can I come in? I'm just gonna go to bed, so perhaps tomorrow? Sure. That'll be fine. Okay. Thank you. I'm certain he's got Gloria at gunpoint. Okay, we now have an armed siege. This is a hostage situation. Pull back and set up a perimeter. He could kill her any second. There's nothing more we can do apart from wait until the trained negotiator gets here. David's still not responding. Look at him. I done you a favor. How dare you decide what's best for me? He was a lowlife. You know, Marcus told me about you. How you'd only bend the rules if there was money in it. He killed your baby. I didn't say that I'd forgiven him! But I did love him. And if this is about how he treated me, how come you killed Callum? Hmm? Oh, it's because I slept with him. Okay, there's no point in us all standing here. You go and see if you can find David. What did you actually think was gonna happen between you and me? I love you, Gloria. Well, you make me sick. I'm armed! I'm gonna kill her! You stupid, stupid man. I don't know if he'd have pulled a gun on me. He couldn't. Dean wasn't actually armed. Then I don't understand. We found Dean's medical records. He was terminally ill. Someone's here to see you. Ah, come here. I'm really sorry, Mum. Dean Casey was using an unregistered mobile. Cell site should tell us where he went after the shooting. Which should give us a chance -to find the gun. -Right, send it over to me. I'll apply for the cell site and call data. - Okay. - Yeah. After the shootings this morning, the first time Dean's phone signal was static in any period was on Bardene Street. Now, I did a voters check. Adrian Cook's mum used to live there before she moved to a care home. That's worth following up. Fancy heading over there with me? Oh, I'd love to, but someone has to brief professional standards. You know how itchy they get about suicide by cop. -Can't the boss do it? -We're still not sure where he is. How did you know I was here? Well, your car's in the car park, and I've searched the rest of the building. You're not planning to throw yourself off, are you? Of course not. That would make you detective inspector. Yeah, and nobody wants that. Look, um, Rob told me that you had a visit from the misper team today. And, well, he's worried that they might have found Sarah. They haven't, have they? No. But they're winding down the inquiry. Which means they think she's dead. They're right. Aren't they? It's -- It's been nearly five months. You think I should accept it? Yeah, I do. But that's easy for me to say. Sarah is dead. My wife is dead. Carly... ...your mother is dead. It will take some getting used to. I didn't kill her. No one thinks that you did. Look, can you come away from the edge? I don't publicize this, but I-I really hate heights. Shall we go downstairs? Okay. Thanks... ...Vivienne. Who am I kidding? Guns. Never really been my thing. I need you to put that on the floor. Look at your face. I'm guessing that this is Marcus Maguire's gun. It's a neat trick. Using his own firearm to take him out. Yeah, I thought so. Had a certain eloquence. How did you convince Dean Casey to do it? Ah, that was easy. He came into the casino, banging on about Marcus and Callum. I merely, merely provided a solution. You're being very open. Let's make this official. Oh, you won't be arresting me today for anything, I'm afraid. Oh, yeah? Why's that, then? Well, if you do... I won't tell you where she is. Who's that? Your detective inspector's wife. Oh, now I have your attention. That's right. Sarah Bradford is very much alive. So, we forget about the gun, and I'll -- I'll tell you all about it.
