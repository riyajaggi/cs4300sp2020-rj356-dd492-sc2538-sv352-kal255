 Oi! ~ Hello? ~ Hi, I'm looking for Tim McKee. ~ And you are? ~ I'm his father. I see. Hey! Hey, open the door! I'm not going anywhere so you might as well open the door. ~ He doesn't want to see you. ~ Have you asked him? ~ We don't want any trouble... ~ Tim! ~ ..but you have to respect your son's wishes. ~ You haven't asked him! ~ We know what he wants. ~ How do you know? Tim! He doesn't want to see you.

 ~ We're a community. ~ No, you're a cult. ~ A community. ~ Yeah, well, I'm his father. ~ Not any more. Don't start that crap with me, mate. I'm looking for my son. ~ I'm looking for Tim... ~ Tim has no parents, no siblings, no relations... ~ Don't you start that crap with me, mate. ~ He's chosen his own family. I'll tear your head off! ~ I'm looking for my son. ~ Lower your voice, remain calm. Don't tell me what to do, mate. ~ All right? ~ Trouble? ~ I'm looking for... ~ This is Tim's birth father. He's arrived unannounced, I've asked him to leave. He's refusing to cooperate. ~ Mr McKee? ~ That's right, yeah. I'm going to explain how things work here. I'm going to speak and I'd like you to listen very, very, carefully.

 ~ Do you want some as well, do you? ~ No, no. ~ Eh? ~ No. Come on. Any of you? Hey, Tim? Get out of my way. Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim, it's me! It's your dad! ~ Vince, this is a mistake. ~ Amanda, get out of my way. ~ We've made our choices, you know how we feel. ~ Get out of my way, Amanda. I want to talk to my son. I'm afraid that's not possible. We need you to leave. I'm not going anywhere until I've talked to him. Yeah, come on. Come on, I dare you. I'd love you to. If violence is your language, it's no wonder your son left. What are you scared of, eh? That they'll reject you? They'll walk away from this sham and never come back, is that it? Not at all. Tim knows his own mind. All right, then. Let me talk to him. Five minutes, no more. Tim, come on, it's your dad. Open up, I want to talk to you. Come on, mate. Come on. It's all right, the fella said I could. Come on, Tim, just let me know you can hear me, will you? Tim, can you hear me? Please, mate... All right, I'm just going to talk and assume that you can, all right? Tim, you're my boy, you're my son, all right? And ever since I first saw your face, I've loved you more than you can possibly imagine. And I want you back, I want you home. More than anything, we all want you home. I know you felt isolated and you felt lost and life didn't add up to much, but this place you've chosen, mate, it's not real. And you can kick out at the world, you can be angry. You can want to change things, but just include us with it, include your mum and your sister and me because it's tearing us apart. We're not angry with you. I'm not angry. You know, we just... just don't understand... ..where it all went wrong. How did we get here, eh? Come on, I need to see your face. I want to see your face. I want to make sure that you're all right. Let me see your face. Vince, I'm sorry. Come on, I want you home now! I want you home now... I want you home now. I want you home. Please... Come on. I love you. Can you enlarge the image? Pull down to the registration plate. Perfect. PHONE RINGS 'Hello?' ~ Where are you? ~ 'I'm at the hospital.' The hospital? Yeah, Sarah's had a baby. Me and my mum are visiting. 'Craig wasn't happy, he threw me out, 'but I got a quick look at the baby.' 'What did she have?' It's a boy. 'She's had a son.' ~ She's calling it Fernando. ~ 'Fernando?' ~ I know! Listen, mate, I need to talk to you soon. Do you fancy a drink? Yeah, all right. Just like me, you know, it was like looking at my own kid. Got a lovely little face, gorgeous, and these little tiny hands. I'm just sitting there, you know, making small talk, having to pretend to be happy for them, you know, and I'm just looking at these delicate little hands and suddenly I realised - like a blinding flash, it hit me. ~ What did? ~ The solution to my problem. My Craig and Sarah problem. Put Craig down the hole. Don't think about it. Craig disappears, Sarah's heartbroken, right? She's a new mum, she can't cope. I steam in, you know, shoulder to cry on, supportive. I help look after little Fernando, try and persuade her to change his name. Before you know it, you know, I'm back where I should be, with me feet under the table, but with a ready-made bonus... of a lickle baby... that coincidentally looks exactly like me. Think about it. I mean, come on, honestly, hand on heart, where's the flaw in that plan? You have to kill your own brother. The brother that shafted me, the brother that stole my life. ~ He didn't steal your life. ~ He stole Sarah. You were in prison for six years. When are you going to stop obsessing about this, eh? When are you going to realise that it's over? That she's had his baby? I can win her back. Will you just..? ~ What's this? An intervention? ~ Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Thanks for the advice. I enjoyed our little chat. Col, you're out of prison now, you've got everything ahead of you, so stop wasting your life. Yeah, well, you'd know about that, wouldn't you? I've got a wife and I've got kids. Look how happy it's made you - so happy you're hanging round with me. Jesus, Vince, something must be bad. ~ I thought you wanted to chat. ~ Yeah, I did. PHONE RINGS Hello. 'What have I told you about not answering this phone?' ~ Have you seen Col? ~ Not recently, no. 'Prick's disappeared.' I need you to pick up Darren and Woodsy. Soon as possible, from the club. Yeah, OK, I'm on my way. ~ You all right, Vince? ~ Yeah, all right. ~ How's your day? Had better. ~ Where we going? ~ We'll direct you. Do you want to stick the radio on? MUSIC STARTS What are we doing? You're not doing anything. You stay here. Me and Woods have got to attend to something. Yeah, but... I mean, you can tell me a few things, can't you? Here you are. What are you doing? We can't get hold of Col, so we're just checking he's done what he was told to, and that's all I can tell you. There's no-one in there. There's blood. How would he have got out? 'This is Colin's phone. 'If it's urgent, ring me mum's, if not, just leaves a message.' The police are here. ~ Right. ~ They say you picked up an injured man off the street. I was going to tell you, but I didn't want to freak you out, all right? Ah, Mr McKee. Yeah. I presume this is about that guy I found, yeah? Just a couple of questions, won't take long. You've got a brew, do you mind if I get one? The paramedic says he asked you to hang around, give them a statement for when we arrived. Yeah, I didn't want to get involved. You know, I took him to the hospital and that was my bit done. ~ Can you confirm where you found him? ~ High Lane. Halfway down, you know where it curves round by the park? I was on a job and he was just...just lying there. ~ So you stopped? ~ Well, wouldn't you? ~ Might have called an ambulance. ~ Well, he was in a bad way, you know? ~ That's all the more reason. ~ Sorry, but have I done something wrong? Not at all. It's just routine. I panicked. I've never seen anyone like that before and... You know, I made the call - this guy needs help and he needs it fast, so I just... I just took him. Sorry. ~ Tell us about the rope that was attached to your car. ~ Rope? The paramedic, he saw a rope attached to your bumper bar. Oh, yeah, I was giving one of the other drivers a tow, that was all. You didn't take it off? No, it was... The knot was too tight, I was going to get a knife, you know, when I got back to work but because of that, I didn't. I know this is awkward, Vince, but we do need to ask these questions. ~ Sure. ~ There's something we have to inform you. The man you helped is a known criminal. His name is Joseph Paslowski. He's a member of a very dangerous criminal gang ~ that operates in another part of Manchester. ~ Oh, my God. We don't know what he was doing over this side of town, but obviously we are... we're looking into it. It doesn't put you in any danger. We're only telling you because if we discover that his injuries are linked to a serious crime... you might be called upon to give evidence in court. Court? Is that likely? Has he said anything? I mean, you know, have you questioned him? He slipped into a coma shortly after you delivered him. Oh, my God. Try not to worry. Your world and their world rarely collide. It just seems your husband was unfortunate - wrong place, wrong time. If we find anything to report, we'll be in touch. That's a nasty cut on your hand. Get that seen to. It's just one of the hazards of the trade, you know. Is that why you had blood on your shirt? Why wouldn't you tell me? ~ Like I said, I was going... ~ Don't give me that crap. Where'd you been? The only reason you didn't tell me was because you'd have to explain where you were coming from, so where were you coming from, Vince? It was Col. ~ I was looking for Col. ~ At six in the morning? Yeah. He called me. You know the night before? You know when I said I was going to the airport? ~ Well, I wasn't, it was Col. ~ Oh... ~ He was pissed, he was upset. He wanted me to take him to see some girl and I said I would, all right? And when I got there, she was in this house full of scumbags and I was worried about him. And the next morning it was going around my head, so I thought I'd go and check on him and then I saw this guy. I'm sorry. You know, I know I did a stupid thing. I know I should have phoned an ambulance or something, but I can't just leave someone to die alone. Can I? Whoever they are. Don't lie to me. What's he got you involved with? Nothing. I am scared, Vince. I'm... I'm scared. What's going on here? It's supposed to be a bit of driving for him. For who? What driving? It's a friend of Col's, that's all. A friend of Col's? A criminal. ~ A businessman. ~ What kind of businessman? What the hell kind of businessman does Colin Vine know? What have you got yourself involved in? I'll go and tell them. I'll tell them now, I want to get out. ~ What kind of businessman? A drug dealer? ~ I don't know. ~ What do you mean, you don't know? How can you not know? What the hell have you got us involved in?! I'll get out, all right? I'll tell them. If you're driving for a criminal, you don't come back in this house. Do you hear me? I warned you. I warned you about getting involved with that idiot friend. I'll tell them, don't worry. ~ Vince. ~ I need to see The Horse. ~ It's not a good time. ~ No, no. I need to talk to him. It's important, you know? You'd better come in. Come in. Have a seat. So, do you want a drink? ~ No, thanks. ~ Drink? No? I'm all right. SHE HUMS I'll tell him you're here, OK? Yeah. DOG BARKS He says to go out. Come. DOG BARKS It's your mate, look. MAN CHUCKLES HE SCREAMS MAN CHUCKLES He didn't do what I asked. Once is an accident. Twice starts to look like carelessness. What didn't he do? When I say someone's finished, they're finished. I don't expect them to show up in the hospital. HE SCREAMS One solo job I give you and you screw it up. Donna says you've something important to tell me. No, it's not important. I just want to say, erm... I'm sorry for not returning your calls, that's all... Ah, well, yeah... Come with me. I've something to show you. HE YELPS GARAGE DOOR CLOSES There's a job coming up. You don't need to know the details, but I need a good driver. We need to get from here... ..to here. Fastest possible route. Side roads, back ways, using your expert knowledge. What time of day? Evening. Post rush hour. ~ Right. ~ Study it. From here to here. ~ What's here? ~ Another car. That's the way it's done. It works. It always works. The only time things go wrong... is when people don't do what they're told. ~ I think we've been neglecting each other. If I promise to try, will you promise to try? ~ Yeah. I promise. Aaargh! I can't do this. It's not what I signed up for. You knew there was risks. Hello. Aaargh! I'm a cab driver. I found someone in the middle of the road, he's injured. The man you helped is a known criminal. ~ He doesn't want to see you. ~ Come on, I want you home now. What the hell have you got us involved in? I'll get out, all right. I'll tell them. I'll get out. Donna says you've something important to tell me. Hey, room service. ~ Do you want the Continental or the full English? ~ Ah. Ros? Ros? ROS? Are you still the driver for a criminal? Are you still the driver for a criminal? ~ Yes, I am. ~ Get out of my house. ~ Let me explain. ~ Get out of my house! It's my house, too! How is he? ~ He's in bed. He won't get out. ~ Can I go and see him? Col? Hi. ~ 'I'm a huge Eurovision fan. ~ Are you? 'Half of the year is taken up with the Eurovision contest...' How you doing? ~ '..go to the contest. ~ You could just...' Are you, er...? '..just the evening it's on. Half a year!' Can we turn that down a bit? I'm watching it. 'Been married for 18 months. 'What I'm saying is there is a world out there. 'Blimey. Richard, what do you do? 'I'm a primary and infant school teacher. 'How long have you done that? ~ 'About five years. ~ So, Richard, what are you hoping will come up? 'Well, I do like Eurovision as well. 'Sport. And anyone who likes Eurovision...' Six years I did for him. Six years. They knew I worked for him, but I kept his name out of it, you know, I stayed loyal. And what did I get in return? I've lost everything. My life's over. No, it isn't. I've got nothing. Should have just...been ordinary, you know, like everyone else. Like these two. Like you. Listen, Col, I want out of the gang, you know. I want to get out. I'm in over my head. You can't. Why not? What do you think they're going to say? "Hello there, Vince. "Ta-ra. Thanks for coming and have a nice life." You can't just resign. Once you're in, you're IN. Until they don't want you no more. Can I get you anything? How did he get out... ..of the hole, Paslowski? How did he escape? He must've got rescued. Yeah? By who? No-one else knew he was in there. At least he's alive, eh? You've not got murder on your conscience. You all right, mate? You're looking a bit better. I couldn't go home last night. It's a long story. Fair enough. Listen, cover for me. I've got to slope off for an hour. A MILF in Harper Hey. Have fun. Always do. I just hope I've got a job when I get back. The filth are in there talking to Amjad. They've probably linked him to a cell in Afghanistan, eh. Discover we've been funding the bleeding Taliban. Sorry for interrupting. I saw you through the window. Not at all. Is this about me? No. It's about me getting my knob out in Sainsbury's. We're simply corroborating your story. Why? Your boss has already confirmed that you were attending a hotel pick-up and that you told him about the incident straight after. So all we need is to speak to the driver that you towed with the rope. What's this? No, you've just missed him actually. He's just gone. Kev Mitchell. ~ I can call him back. ~ No. He's with his girlfriend. You know, it's one of those one's he meets online. Hey, look, it's fine. We'll call back. You just tell him that we want to talk to him. I'm just a bit confused about why this is getting so much attention. There's not been a crime, has there? There's a gang problem in this city, Vince. A lot of people get drawn into it - drug runners, middlemen. People think it's easy money, till they get caught. Oh, by the way, it's good news on the guy that you saved. He's out of his coma. We're hoping he'll be able to talk soon. I didn't know Kev had had car trouble. When drivers have maintenance issues I usually get to hear about it. We've all got maintenance issues, ain't we? Cos we're skint, because some fat, greedy bastard keeps creaming off all the profits. You are a lying bastard, Vince... What? ..and if there is one thing I can't stand, it's lying bastards. But there is one thing worse than being a lying bastard and that's being a bad lying bastard and you, Vincent, my old China, are a very bad lying bastard. So are you going to tell me what's going on or am I going to order your P45? Just do what you like. Kev, it's Vince. Listen, as soon as you get your trousers back on will you call me? It's urgent, all right? Kev, come on. How long does it take, mate? Give me a call back, will you? OK, you can come back. 'Not to stay, to talk.' I need details. I need to know everything that's happened. 'Start to finish. 'And no more lies, Vince. OK?' Cos that's the only way we're going to be able to deal with this. Shit. Kev, where are you? A burger joint, back at the station. It sounds like you better join me. Listen, have you been back to work yet? No, not yet. I always like a bit of nosebag after leg-over. All right, yeah, listen, just stay there. I'm on my way, all right? Don't go anywhere. ~ Hey. ~ Hey. How was she? Enthusiastic, grateful. I love married women. Haven't been shagged properly in years. Sometimes they cry from the sheer relief. ~ I know. ~ YOU know? Really? Yeah. Truth is I've been a bit of a bad lad myself, you know. Oh, tell me all, go on. ~ I went on that website you told me about. ~ No Strings. Yeah. Met this married woman. ~ You know, she's got a couple of kids and that. ~ You dirty dog. She's got enormous fun bags. Why do you think I was in the car last night? What's her name? Maybe I've had her already. Charlene. Charlene? That don't ring any bells. I had a Charlotte. Yeah, look, I went round there a couple of mornings ago, you know, cos her husband was away and I thought, "Why not?" Why not indeed? Where were the kids? They were in their bedrooms. What? You had her with her kids in the house. Hey, respect due. She'd had a bit of trouble with her car the night before, you know. It was broken-down and stuff and I said, "Don't worry about it. I'll give you a tow." ~ So? ~ So I did and that was fine, you know. But I just threw the rope in the back of the car cos I was in a hurry. I had to get to work, you know. Then I was going away and there was this, like, fella just lying there ~ at the side of the road, he was really badly injured. ~ Really? So I took him to hospital and I thought that would be it, you know. It turns out he's like a really hardcore criminal. You know those coppers that came to see Amjad? They wanted to talk to me, you know. Nothing bad, just to confirm my story, you know. ~ Just procedure, that's all. ~ Right. ~ But the thing is I couldn't tell them I'd been with a married woman, could I? ~ No, you don't want that getting back home. ~ Exactly. Yeah. So I told them I was with you. That I'd given you a tow. They just want to talk to you. Right. So you're asking me to lie to the police. It's just a white lie, you know. Just... Just to confirm my story, that's all. ~ That's it and that's the last you'll hear of it. ~ That's perjury, mate. That's perverting the course of justice. I don't know what it is, but that's something. Come on, Kev. This is my marriage. What if there's CCTV? No. It's Bolton Street to your house, I mean, there's so many routes, isn't there? It's just your word against theirs. No, Vince. No, mate. ~ I'm not getting involved, mate. ~ Please, Kev. I'm begging you. 500 quid. ~ A monkey? ~ Yeah, right now, in your hand. I can get it for you. Come on, I need you to do this for me. OK. Thanks, mate. What is it today, then? Vitamin soup. Listen, Dad, I've got a friend coming over. All right. Ryan. Is that all right? Yeah. Listen... if you're happy, I'm happy. All right? Sorry to interrupt. Can I have a word? I'm sorry. Er... just...continue in your groups and I'll be back in a jiffy. SOUP-er. What the hell happened? You said you were on your way. ~ I'm sorry. Something came up. It was really... ~ Important? More important than talking to your wife. ~ Ros, please. ~ I'm working, Vince. You remember work? That thing normal people do to earn money. I went to see Tim. When? Yesterday. What happened? He wouldn't talk to me. He locked himself in his room. I spoke to him through the door. I pleaded with him but he wouldn't open up. Was she there? The girlfriend. So what happened? You just left him there, came home, again. Well, I couldn't kidnap him, could I? Why not? I thought that's what criminals did. ~ I talked to him, all right? I told him things. ~ Through a door. Yeah, and he heard me. I know he did. I told him what this was doing to us. And what good did it do? What impact did it make? Zero. At least I tried, eh? At least I did something. You failed, Vince. You fail at everything. What did you do, eh? You're his mother. Why don't you get down there? Why don't you go down there? Why aren't you kicking the door in, eh? I had to fight to get in. ~ Let go of me! ~ Don't walk away from me, Ros, all right, cos I've got to talk about this. ~ (There's people in there waiting for me.) ~ I don't care. Why do you think this is happening? Why do you think I got involved with Col and all that? I've got no idea. Because I needed things to change. We've fallen apart and what do you do? Stick your trainers on and go running but you won't talk to me, will you? So you take up with a criminal? Yeah. It made me feel good. It made me feel like I could do something. It was a stupid mistake. Why couldn't you just have an affair? It would have been better if he'd died, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it? Hey, wouldn't it? It would have been better if he'd died. Cos we could have held each other, we could have mourned our son instead of you blaming me, cos that's what you've done. You hated me. And I felt that. I felt that every day since and that's not right. Is it? Things just happen just for no reason sometimes, don't they? I'm going to get it. Is your husband in?> ~ Get off! ~ Vincent McKee, I'm arresting you on suspicion of attempted murder. You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention anything you later rely on in court. What's happening? ~ Mum! ~ It's OK. It's all right. ~ What has he done? What have you done? We need to speak to both of you at the station. Vince. Follow me. Your friend from the taxi rank, Kev Mitchell, called us. It seems you didn't give him a tow on the morning in question. It seems you were trying to use him as an alibi. Which would have been strange enough... had he not seen you, a number of weeks ago, mysteriously driving a large, black saloon. How about we start at the beginning? I've got nothing to say. 'You're going to prison for a long time. 'Just with what we've already got, I can get you ten years. 'Away from your wife, kids.' How will they cope? Ten years, Vince. What are you now? 44, 45? How do you fancy being banged up till your mid-50s? Come out - no job, no home... ..wife shacked up with someone else. And you - a criminal, done time. Family destroyed. We've seen it happen. We can protect your family if you work with us. Who are you scared of? Help me and I'll help you. But if you don't, I'll have no choice. DS Ryder leaving the room at 15.45. The time is 17.01. Re-commencing interview with Vince McKee. I'm a driver for a criminal gang and they're planning a job but I want out. I thought I was just going to be driving but I made a mistake. You've got to see this. My name's Greg Tyler. I work for the Force Intelligence Bureau. We need to get you out of here. You're now under tracker surveillance. 24-hour monitoring of your phones and your car. That's for your protection and our security. Everything has to continue as normal. Yeah. Where are my family? They're with Liaison, being taken to a secure location. How am I going to tell them? In my experience, bad news is best told quickly. Ready? Yeah. Thanks, guys. Dad. I'm sorry. ~ Dad. ~ It's all right. I'm sorry I dragged you into all this. You're not a bad man. I told them that. I told them that you're not bad. I made a mistake. OK. Have you been charged? What are we doing here? Vince. I've, um... I've made a deal. Not a deal. ~ What kind of deal? ~ It's not a deal. It's, um... an arrangement. Information. I'll give them information and in return they'll... They'll...? I'll be prosecuted but I won't go to prison. Meaning? We'll be protected. Protected? How? Vince will continue as a member of the gang for a short period of time. Your life, to the outside world, will look, feel, smell exactly as it always has and then, I'm afraid to say, ~ things will change. ~ How? What will happen? They're planning a job, they're doing a robbery and I'm going to work for the police. OK? ~ No. ~ (It's all right.) Sh. Katie, it's OK. ~ It's OK. Come here. Just breathe. ~ Katie. Come on. Breathe. Deep breaths. I'm sorry. Stop saying that. It's too... It's too late for that. ~ Why, Dad? Why? ~ It's this or prison. Katie, to get through this we need to be together, all right. They're going to look after us, you know. We'll be safe. We'll be OK. Protected how? How does this work? Will they go down and you stay out? I mean, they'll kill you. They'll... Or us. They'll find you. ~ Vince, do you realise what you've agreed to? ~ They won't find you. They won't find us. What, you mean...? You'll get a new life. Somewhere different. New identity. No. ~ No. I don't want to do that. ~ Katie. No. I don't want to do that. Oh, this isn't real. ~ Where would we go? ~ That's to be decided. I don't want to do that! ~ Katie. ~ No, Dad. No. My life's here. I don't want a new life. I'm going to college. I've got a boyfriend. ~ Look, just listen to him. ~ No, you listen to me. Go on. Just look. Look. Look! See? Facebook. There's 500 friends and they know me. You can't just disappear. ~ There's a programme. ~ Fuck your programme. You don't have to agree and it's not my job to convince you. I need Vince. And Vince is smart enough to realise I'm his only way out. But I'm saying this to help you. These are bad people and they'll want revenge and you're putting yourselves in extreme danger if you choose not to join him. ~ I'm assuming no-one will be able to know where we are. ~ No. My mum, my sister. I'll have to find a new job. This is everything, Vince. ~ Is this really the only way? ~ Just think about it, eh? This could be positive. It's like a new life, you know. A fresh start, somewhere brand-new. This could be good for us. This is the end of our life. Are you serious? In two years you'll be in uni. You'll have a fresh start. But your mum and me, we need this. Tim. ~ What about Tim? ~ He's our son. He's away. We don't speak to him. We don't see him anymore. Do you know where he lives? We could contact him, explain. But if he refused to go, I'm afraid there's nothing we could do. ~ Then, no. No deal. ~ Ros, please. We can't do it. We can't... We'd never see him again. Look, he doesn't want to be part of us any more. ~ We'd never see him again. ~ Look, he doesn't want us. ~ I'm not leaving my son. ~ He doesn't want to be with us any more. Look, you've just got to accept that. I can't ever accept that. What choice do we have? We'll take you to retrieve your taxi. In one hour's time you'll get a call through your work to attend a pick-up at Burton Road tram station. That will be myself and a member of our organised crime unit. You'll drive us to a location of our choosing and we'll discuss how this is going to work. Understand? Yeah. Drive. We'll direct you as we go. It's unlikely that the gang will know that you've been arrested, but if for any reason they do, you just stick as close to the truth as possible. You found a man who was lying in the street, injured, you took him to hospital, and then you fled the scene. The arrest was merely routine. OK? And hope to God that they believe you. We don't want to put you in any danger, we very much want you alive, but make no mistake here, Vince. The stakes couldn't be higher. We need you to remain an integral part of their team. They can't get even the slightest hint that you're betraying them. The job has to go ahead for a successful prosecution. To bang these bastards up for life, we need to catch them in the act, huh? Now, this is a direct line. Just put it into your phone as something insignificant, "window cleaner", "carpet guy". You only call when you know it's safe and when we answer, all we'll say is "Hello." We won't say anything else until we know it's you. I'm your best friend right now, Vince, all right? I want to keep you alive. I want to give you your freedom. But if you try to abscond... or deviate in any way from what we've agreed here, you're looking at life inside. And believe me, Vince - everybody will know that you're a grass. Is that them? Hello? 'Where the hell have you been?' Sorry, my car broke down, so... 'You're needed. Pick me up in half an hour. At the club.' I'm on the other side of town, so it'll take me a while. 'As soon as you can.' He wants me now. Then you should go. Listen, what was wrong with my lie just then? Always try and keep your story to the truth. That way it won't trip you up later. Not tonight, chief. I'm here to meet The Horse. Are you the driver? Yeah. I'll take you through. Vince... keep Thursday free. It's Thursday. Come round this Thursday. Apparently hedgehogs are dying out. I once sat on an hedgehog. You sat on an hedgehog? Yeah. When I was a kid. My brother put one on me chair when I weren't looking. I sat down, 300 pins up me sphincter. I went ballistic. ~ I don't suppose the hedgehog was too pleased either. ~ No. No, he wasn't. Dropkicked him into the pond behind our house. Hey. What is this place? It's where we come to plan the jobs. The Chinese Cash and Carry on Lowman Street is used by everyone. Their biggest retail days are Wednesday and Thursday as the restaurants prepare for the weekend. They still use old-fashioned security... We only discuss this job in this room. Oh, Vince? I think you know enough, hmm? You're just the driver. So make yourself useful. Yeah? I need to see them. Over my dead body. Yeah, if necessary. Just because you're playing at gangsters, Vince, ~ doesn't mean that you scare me. ~ I need to see them. You're not coming in. ~ Don't be ridiculous. ~ You're not coming in. ~ Look, get out of my way, will you? ~ You're not coming in... ~ You can't stop me seeing my wife and kid. ~ That is the end of it. Just move. Thursday? Thursday? Five more days as myself? Five more days of this life? I thought it would be longer. But at least this way we, um... ~ At least what? ~ Well, there's less time to be discovered, less time for things to go wrong. No. ~ Katie... ~ Leave her. You've made us targets. Even if we go away, we're still at risk. They find people, Vince. Months, years later. They'll give us security until the trial. They've promised that, haven't they? After that, they'll be in prison, ~ and they won't know where we are. ~ Tell him what I suggested. Melinda's saying we can go to her caravan on Anglesey. Me and Katie. Just Ros and Katie. Stay there as long as we need. We'd have to get a divorce, I'd go back to my maiden name, but... that way we wouldn't have to give up our whole lives. That's not going to work, is it? You'll just spend the rest of your life worrying. We will anyway. If people know where you are, then you're in danger. And Katie's in danger. Besides, I want us to be together. Happy families? Look at us. Do you remember those people? Because we're still them. Cos we never used to be like this. We had fun, didn't we? We were full of things that we wanted to do with our life. And that is who I want us to be again. Too much has happened. So - what? You're just going to give up? You're going to throw it all away? I have been a good husband, for 18 years. And I want you to stay with me. Don't listen to him. We've lost enough already, haven't we? Come here. Here. You'll need to wear this. What is it? A wire. So that we can hear you. You just clip it inside your coat. It looks like a spare button or something. We've got units positioned at three locations. Some of them are armed. If it goes wrong, shots will be fired. As long as you stay in the driver's seat of the vehicle at all times, no-one will shoot you. 'Hi, Tim's phone. Leave a message.' Tim, it's your dad. It's Vince. I miss you. And whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you. ~ You're late. ~ It was the traffic. I thought you was a getaway driver. I am. Shame you've got to burn it. You're late. Get in. All right, mate. Vince. I'm having a piss. You don't sound like you're pissing. Open the door. I'm sitting down. Open the door, Vince. Hang on. ~ Open the door, Vince. ~ All right. All yours... I know it was you Vince, so don't even try and deny it. I did my bit. I did my job, I did exactly as I was told to... and then, because you screwed it, I took the beating and the Horse thinks I'm a useless prick. What? He brought you back in, didn't he? Out of desperation, yeah. As soon as he's had use of me I'll be back out on my ear. I'm not stupid, Vince, I know when I'm being used. Well, I can't have that. I need him to know the truth, so here's what's going to happen, we're going to go out there, you're going to talk to the Horse and tell him the truth. He'll kill me. Tough shit. I'm sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen. I need the Horse to know the truth. I need him to know I'm not a screw up, cos everyone always thinks I'm a screw up. I can't do it. I can't do what you're asking. You'll find I'm the one holding the gun. Come on, we've got a job to do, eh? We can't trust you. We're mates, Col. Don't pull that mate shit with me. I never should have trusted you. I never should have brought you in. Do you want to know the reason why? I didn't do it for you, Vince. I did it for me. To get back in with them, to cosy myself up to the Horse. Go. I mean it, Vin... I mean it. I need to tell you something. I need you to close the door. Close the door. Come here. I'm under surveillance. I'm working for the police. What...? Are you lying? Cos if this is lies to get out of this, I'm going to take your knees right now. It's the truth. For fuck's sake, for fuck's sake... They're going down, Col. This job, they're on to them, and they're all going down... ~ You bastard. ~ I had no choice. ~ You rat bastard. ~ I had no choice. They caught me. It was me or them. Listen, I've kept your name out of it, OK? They know I know you, but I told them that you were out of the gang, that you were going straight. They won't come looking for you, I swear to God... You're in the clear... You could just walk out of here... How? I'm here. Just make some excuse, I don't know. Just walk away. I should just... I'm sorry. What the bloody hell am I going to tell them? Hm? What? I tell them where I've gone? I mean, if I... Col, listen to me. You can get out of this. You can just walk away. Are you two holding each other's others dicks in there or what? Yeah, you want to join us? We leave in ten minutes. What if I just tell them? Then I die. Is that what you want? There's money. It's in my shed. It's in Tim's hard box underneath there... Take it. Take it all. Take anything you want. Go on, have it... Go. Just be ordinary. I can't believe Col walked out. I'm going to kill him. Bottling bastard... What was he saying? ~ What were you two talking about in the bog? ~ Nothing. Sorry. He just came from nowhere, didn't he? I've got the fear about this. Something's wrong... Just stay calm. Everyone stays calm, everything'll be cool. You wait. Even if you hear sirens, you wait. We all escape together or go down together. Right? You get me sent down, I'll make sure your daughter gets killed. Dad. 'Tim.' 'I've left 'em. I've... I've come away... 'Mum left a message saying...' soon that I'd never see you again... I don't want that, Dad. Where are you? Burtonwood Services. First one out of town... They don't know that I've left yet, but they will soon. 'Can you come and get me, Dad? I want to come home...' I'm on my way. Oi! Stop him! Stop him! Oi... Stop! What are you doing, you idiot? Stop! Slow down, you grass. I knew it was you! I knew it was you. Armed police. Stay down! Stay down! You bent bastard. I knew it. Armed police. Stand still! Armed police. Stand still. Don't move. Don't move. Get down on the floor! Get down on the floor NOW! All right, all right, all right. Right, right, right. Yes, we're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. Get down now! Get down on the floor! Dad. Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought I'd lost you. It's all right. It's all right. Come on. ~ I'm parked over here. Get you home, eh? ~ Yeah. You're safe now. Vince. Where the hell are you? 'It's all right, I'm coming back.' Yeah, no. I'm coming back now. Don't worry. I just had to do something, that's all. 'Hello?' Ros, I've got someone who wants to talk to you...
