 What was on the laptop? What were you trying to hide? He had it recorded. My sessions with Isaac. Bastard had it all on his laptop. It's probably just a simple theft, but I'd rather be safe than sorry, with all these other bodies turning up. You can't be objective about this any more - you shouldn't be leading this investigation. If you take me off the case, our little arrangement at the safe house goes to Professional Standards. Nothing can fix the kind of man your father was. Here's to you, Dad, rot in pieces.

 Are you still sleeping with her? Does it matter, after you lied to me the way you did? We all make mistakes. She wanted to hurt herself, because of me. - Christine, tell me. - I killed them. Why? Because I like it. ..been asleep for quite a while. You're going to be groggy. I'm not an invalid. I can walk. - Please. - I'm fine. See? Thanks.

 Are you sure you want this? Yeah. Hi, Dad! Hey. Dad? You'll never guess what I finally convinced Mum to get. It's in the lounge. It took a lot of arm twisting. It's so ugly. And we stocked up on box sets. So we can binge until our eyes fall out. Can you give us a moment, love? Yeah. I'm glad you're home. Me too. It's going to take time. For all of us. But that's normal, the doctors said... You're allowed to be angry. It's unfair, what happened to you. We all get what we deserve. Eventually. What's going on? I heard what you said. In the hospital. Jesus, Gabriel... ..I wanted to tell you-I tried to tell you. Leave me alone. Don't do this. Please, I'm so sorry. Please, Gabriel, I'm sorry. DON'T! Don't you touch me. NEVER touch me again! I'm sorry. - Synced & Corrected by Dragoniod - www.addic7ed.com Rellik 1x04 "Episode 04" Oct 2, 2017. Police! Kerri? Kerri? Kerri? - Nothing? - Mm-mm. Police! Coming upstairs. - "At the beginning of the second. - _ half, there didn't seem any danger "at first as Kline was in the far end of the defence line... "..securing the onward..." You want her to stop? What I want is an update on the case. This is time to rest. These next few months you need to forget about work, focus on getting better. Lisa-please. OK. But only because we could do with a break. And only for 20 minutes. No more. He wants you. So we'll just go grab a bite. How is he? Infuriating. He came this close to... But still nothing's changed. Are you married? No. Good. If I were you, I'd try and keep it that way. Where are we with CCTV? We've harvested from six different sites but none of them are close enough to the scene. I need to see the footage. It might trigger something. I can bring you a laptop. Seven beautiful hours of the stuff. You can knock yourself out. Do you think I was attacked because I was getting near the truth? Don't flatter yourself, we're nowhere. You were attacked because you insulted him at a press conference. You made it personal. And did you find the girl? Did you find Kerri? She's not at any of her usual haunts. We're talking to known associates. - You have to find her. - Yeah. And don't involve Benton. From now on, it's just you and me. There's a bag in the locker. Run the DNA against my profile. I don't suppose there's any point in asking you why. What took you so long?! Got anything to tell me, Kerri? There's people following me. There aren't people following you. Where's my money? I have some of it. I can give you a couple straightaway... I said ten. Maybe I should go to the papers. No! That would be a mistake, Kerri. Would it? People are dying, all right? You have to tell me what you saw. Right now. What if I give you...? There's someone here, I swear. You've sent someone to do me? I don't even know where you are. You're police. You'd figure it out. This isn't a fucking game show. He burns their faces, he cuts off their fingers, he obliterates... Kerri? Kerri? Kerri! Talk to me! KERRI! _ Thanks for the call. She left about half an hour ago. Went for breakfast across the road. You've got 20 minutes max. - And the daughter? - Hasn't been in today. He's still weak. Let's not go in mob-handed, eh? Give me a couple of minutes. Hey! It's Tutankhamun risen from the grave. Don't worry, mate, I'll do the talking. I just need to clarify something first. Don't mention the safe house. It has nothing to do with what happened to you. Completely separate, and would be best for both of us. Do you understand? Nod once for yes, or twice for a kick in the bollocks. Do we have a deal? Good! It's...great to see you making such good progress, mate. Hello. Look at me. No. Gabriel, look at me. Hi. You're OK. Any news on the case? The attacker? You're joking? Or the latest victim? Larkwell Park? No. No fibres, forensics, prints or sightings. Just like the others. He's a ghost. He'll make a mistake. Do you remember anything? I... I remember your voice. In the ambulance. Yeah. Anything before that? There must be something. Something that can help us find whoever did this. Kerri Upson. Do you mean the sex worker we brought in a couple of months ago on the Joseph Kennedy case? Are you saying you were with her? Find her... Ask her what she saw. Benton. Don't tell Benton. I don't want to say it. You're safe here. It's just you and me now. So... Tell me, Christine. Christine. I killed them. And then I burned them. Every single part. So that no-one would ever know who they are. Just me. I know who they are. I know what happened to them. Their friends and their family... ..they'll have to live with the uncertainty the rest of their lives. Why, Christine? Why did you kill them? Because I like it. Um... Can you be more...specific? It, uh... ..it gets me off, you know? Taking their lives, one by one. Giving them a new... ..giving them a new... For God's sake, Christine... I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I can't take this seriously any more. I can't do it! Oh, don't look so sad. You must've realised I was having you on, Isaac. Christine-you were concerned that you'd revealed too much and now you're trying to cover up. But you don't have to, - you can trust me. - No. I made it up because I knew you'd get a kick out of hearing it. What is it you called me? A "narcissist with psychopathic ideation". So what did you expect? The difference is, is that you're no better. You are obsessed with this shit, aren't you? You like looking at it. I was trying to help you. You were trying to get with me. Beautiful day, isn't it? Don't I get a kiss? Piss off, Grandad. I don't know how you expect to make a living if you never go to work. Next time I call, 30 or 40 times, you fucking contact me, immediately. I've had enough of all this. I just want to get away. You and I need to have a little chat about the other night. In case someone needs to talk to you. I think I can help you, you know? Because I saw what happened to your mate, when he was attacked in the park. When he got his face burnt. Don't take the piss. I was there. I got a good look at the face of the person that did it to him. Jesus, Kerri, this is for real. I can give you a description. Well, go on, then. Tell me. I want 10k. People are getting murdered! Yeah, and I'm probably next. Because they saw me too. We were this close. Looked each other bang in the eyes. So... I need to get away. Well, I could drag your scrawny arse down the station and make you talk. Oh, yeah, and then I'd talk. About everything. Is that what you want? Didn't think so. I just don't have ten grand lying around... Put it on expenses. Nick it from evidence. - I don't fucking care. - That isn't how it works. It works like this, you get me ten grand, and you phone me when you've got it. End of. This is the bit I was telling you about - the ascending sequence in the mid section? I love the way it ends in a perfect cadence. I can't do it for shit, but I still love it all the same. Thanks for making me play. I know I did kick off about it, but I'm glad now. Please get better. Mum will be back in a minute. See you tomorrow, yeah? _ Don't worry. You're in hospital. I'm Dr Zagorakis. Your wife and daughter are here to take care of you. Can you hear me? Try to keep your eyes open for me. Is he OK? He's not coming round. But there's nothing to worry about. Why can't he open his eyes? His vitals are fine. You said he was going to wake up. Nurse, please, some more oxygen, please. Why can't he open his eyes? I've been working with DCI Markham. Listen to me, I'm a doctor, I'm a psychiatrist, Dr Isaac Taylor, and I have been working with... How is he? You must be DI Elaine Shepard. This is a secured area. Was he conscious when he came in? How did you know he was here? I heard he saw his attacker. Now, he's the first to survive. I was helping him. I can help you. You shouldn't be here, Mr Taylor. I want to offer my expertise. I was helping DCI Markham with the case. I've done profiling for lots of forces. My colleague was viciously attacked and you're using that to hustle for more work? No, I'm doing this because my partner, Jonas Borner, was killed, possibly by the same person. Look, you knew I was working for DCI Markham... Mr Taylor... You're looking for someone with a history of abuse... Mr Taylor! ..but no familial ties. Now, murder... Mr Taylor. ..it's an expression of passion for this individual, reflected in their choice of hydrochloric acid rather than a more efficient method of burning... Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor, we have this in hand. Markham and I have been through my files. DCI Markham is in the ICU, this is not the time. Let me help you. I can help. I want to help. Could you show Mr Taylor to the exit, please? I want to help. Just... I can help you, let me help you! You don't need to... It's all right. Come this way, please. Yeah, you don't need to touch me. Listen, all I want to do-please, don't touch-all I want to do is help, I just want to find this person, that's all. Gabriel, are you awake? Can you hear me? Why won't you wake up? You never make things easy, do you? How did we get here? We made some wrong turns, but we didn't deserve this. And we always loved each other. We could have walked away... ..but we didn't. Of course, you knew, didn't you? You've known the whole time. However bad things got with us, you never blamed her. You always treated Hannah as your own daughter, even though... I'll always love you for that. Did you...? Water. Oh, my love! My love! Are you...? Christ...call a doctor, he's awake. _ Just keep your eyes closed! Don't let the acid in. Keep them shut! They're here now, OK? They're here now. You just have to hold out a bit longer. Male victim under acid attack, all units to the Lavers Road estate. OK, sir, I need you to remain as calm as possible. OK? I'm just going to give you something for the pain... OK? Calm as possible. That's just a bandage, Gabriel. Try not to move so much. We're nearly there. This is Gabriel Markham. Assault with acid. Burns to face, neck, upper torso. GCS 15 throughout. BP 129. OK, you can't come through. You've got to stay here. Sorry. I'll wait while you're in theatre. I'll be right here. Right, talk to me. Well, we haven't got much to go on but we've established a basic scenario. DCI Markham's car is parked 130m away... we don't know why he was there, or why he got out, but we do know that he was attacked over here. We believe the assailant made an exit through the north entrance via Lavers Road. That's it? Sir. Shit. Where's the boss? I dunno, is he not with you? Kerri. Call me back as soon as you can. Something happened last night. We need to talk. How's he doing? They... They had to intubate because they think he might have swallowed some acid. Oh, Jesus Christ. Look, we don't have to do this now. But... But if there's anything that you can tell me... Let's take it from the beginning. What were you doing there? Gabriel called me. Right. Um... Right, come on. What did you see? I saw his car. He wasn't in it. He wasn't on the street. And then I heard him. Screaming. He was in the park. It was dark. But I could see the shapes... Could you see the attacker? I don't... I don't know. It was so dark. He was dressed all in black. I ran at him. And as soon as I went for him, he fled. That's very brave of you, DI Shepard. He wasn't quick. I could have caught up with him. But then I heard Gabriel scream again. I stopped to call the ambulance instead, because I just thought that would be better... You don't have to explain. Looking after your partner, you did the right thing. You saved his bloody life, Elaine. You're a hero. Why don't I feel like one, then? You're no fun any more. At least eat something. You know what you're like when your blood sugar... Suit yourself. You did your best. You'll probably get a medal for what you did. I keep seeing his face. He's alive, isn't he? And anyway, he hasn't exactly treated you well so don't go wasting any tears on him. But I love him. You're too bright to let that man take any more of you. You need to cut yourself off from him. Ask for a transfer. Anything. Just get as far away from him as you can. You know what? I don't want to hear what you think any more. Screw you. _ That sounds great! It's been too long. Have you seen my charger? Er... Next to the TV. No, I mean the one for my computer. Top of the stairs. Next to the basket. Thank you! Any time from eight is good for us. - Debbie and Sam are coming over. - I'm not cooking. Great. Gabriel says he'd love to cook. Right, see you both Saturday. Look forward to it. I'll make it up to you. How? I want details. Well... How about...? Morning, fuckface. Thank you! Look after my handsome boy. Do you mean me? We've moved him because of his health. He always gets what he wants. How are you? I'm your dad. I care about you. I just want to know how you are. I'm fine. You managed to move wing. The cancer's getting worse. They moved me so I can be nearer to the medical unit. You look tired. Are you getting enough regular sleep? Police work isn't exactly nine to five. I always thought that was an odd career choice. Must grate on the old soul. Seeing the things you see... What are you doing? I'm just checking to see if you're all right. I'm fine. You haven't caught him yet, have you? Any insights you can share? Be good to hear from another murderer what his take on all this is. What would I know? I'm just a chemistry teacher. A dying one, too. Which reminds me - you don't have to worry. I'm not going to change my will. If you leave your shit to me, I'll burn anything you ever so much as looked at. What, even the Jaguar? Come and see me again, darling. No. This is the last time you see me. That's not good enough. I killed her, but you should know, I really loved her. So much. I mean-18... ..18 stab wounds. That qualifies as an act of passion. Do us all a favour, Henry. Hurry up and die. Right. Looks like we're all going on a night out. Don't get too excited, although it will involve overtime... we've had a tip-off. I want to report a...my husband... Take your time, my love. You know those murders... I think it's him. He works late nights, not regular, but every time he does... He'd kill me if he knew I... You're being very brave. Every time you find a body... March 21st, the 22nd, April 14th... Does he have a name, love? He's working late tonight. Just a name. He'll never know. Please stop him. Is it genuine? Well, the first date, March 21st, it's not public domain. So, either our investigation has a leak, or we take her at face value. Any of you bastards been leaking? No? Good. And though the call has been anonymised, triangulation puts her here. Which is in the middle of all previous drop zones. The victims are always left in parks in east London. No CCTV, and close enough to roads so no need to carry the body in plain sight for more than a minute. On this basis, we've identified 40 possible drop sites. I need 100 officers. 800 hours of overtime on a single night. All on an anonymous tip-off? I'm going to catch him with a body in his arms. And then you lot are all going to buy me a drink for making you look good. All right, now piss off and do your jobs. You ready? I'll go with Sergeant Roberts. Vehicles en route. Northern 147 on foot. Silver command received. Silver en route, ETA two minutes. It's bloody freezing out here. I can't get ill again. I've got a stag do coming up. If I do and it's just because of that man's ego, I'll... Stop whining. Just suck it up. He does your head in too, though, right? He gets the job done. Besides, jealousy does not suit you, Mike. Never been on one of these before. We did them in training, but...this is exciting. You're very distracting, aren't you, Jenny? Hold on. Movement. South-west corner. Is he carrying a body? Shit. There's two of them. Silver has a visual on two suspects. Requesting backup. God, I love this bit. Where did they go? Leave our neighbourhood alone! Get your fucking scum off our streets! We're police! We're fucking police! - Come on! - Backup stand down. False alarm. I need an ambulance. No arrests, but at least nobody died. Whole thing was just a set-up, right? He's just fucking with me! The call was genuine. 100%. Probably laughing at us right now. Running around like a bunch of idiots. Jesus! Hey, you need some rest. 100 officers! Eight hours of overtime! Look, we took a shot and we missed. It's happened before. All we've got to do is we regroup and we move on. No, Gabriel. This isn't just a misfire. Right on our own doorstep! You and 100 police, an army- ooking the other way. Another body right beneath our fucking noses! Is it true there's been another body? At 5.30 this morning, we... At 5.30 this morning, the body of a white male in his 40s was found at Larkwell Park. That's a quarter of a mile from this station, correct? We are appealing for witnesses. Anyone who was in the vicinity or the surrounding area... I know you're watching this. You're watching me, aren't you? You're weak. You're weak and you're pathetic. You're a limp-dicked bag of shit. Come back to mine. I'll cook something. We don't need to talk. I can eat at home. Come back to mine. I want to be with my family. Would you like some more wine? Dad? Sorry. I drifted away. I just asked if you wanted some more wine. Oh. I'm fine, thanks. It's unfair to make me drink alone. Well, I'll drink with you if Dad won't. Nice try! Hey, I got to get back to work. Do you have to? Won't it keep till morning? I'll take you to that new restaurant next weekend. ? I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' about half past dead ? ? I just need someplace where I can lay my head ? ? "Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?" ? I'm off to bed. Lightweight. Hey, I was watching that. It's him again. Don't answer it. - Hey. - Hey. Do you want to meet? What are we doing, Gabriel? You know what this is. I thought I did, but... This is just who I am. I won't change, Elaine. You know that, don't you? It's just sex? It's just sex. Come to the safe house. I'll meet you there in half an hour. ? Take a load off, Fanny ? ? And you put the load right on me... ? Oh, great! You're not meant to be here. Get dressed. Now. Fuck! Well, thanks for that! What are you playing at? You'll ruin this place for both of us. And somehow you're here, when you could be tucked in bed with Lisa. You fucking idiot! I'm looking out for you! Bringing street girls back to the safe house is career suicide. Job. Pension. The lot. Gone. You've done worse, mate. You have done much worse! Go on, then. Settle up, Grandad. I'm short. Can you cover for me, mate? Oh, Jesus. Come on. Come on. My money? Here. That's too much. It's fine. Do you have anywhere to stay tonight? I'll be OK. No, we'll find you somewhere safe. My car's just over here. I won't hurt you. I'm the police. What, like him? He's an arsehole. I'll be fine on my own from here. Well, you take care. Please leave your message after the tone. Hey, it's me. Listen, don't come to the safe house. There's been a mess-up. Meet me in the car park. I'll be there in a second. Get off! Police! Police! Gabriel, is that you? Breathe, keep breathing, Gabriel. I know, it's OK, sweetheart. I need an ambulance. _ - Synced & Corrected by Dragoniod - www.addic7ed.com
