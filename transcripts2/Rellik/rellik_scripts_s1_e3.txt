 You had the laptop destroyed. The fire, that was you. Don't know what you're on about. The connection to Isaac Taylor, we're onto something. What if she's the one that did this to me? This is you, screwing your partner. After you lied to me the way you did, does it matter? - I still want you. - It's over, Elaine. - I can't stay here. - So let me come. Not together. I wish we could just be living our lives. It's going to be all right.

 You're still grounded. - Six weeks. - Mum...? You can't play me and your dad off against each other. - Christine, tell me. - I killed them. Why? Because I like it. She's fine. - Is she? - Yeah. I mean, this is what teenagers do, isn't it? Really? This? Not my daughter. We all make mistakes. This wasn't a mistake.

 It was deliberate. She wanted to hurt herself. Because of me. Thanks for coming along today. For everything. If you hadn't been there, I would have ended up with a scar on the back of my head, as well. The full 360. I'm glad you were there. So am I. I got to live out some fantasies of a misspent youth. What did you spend your youth on? Studying. Locked in a room, losing my mind. It paid off, didn't it? Oh, yeah. Look at me now, reaping the benefits! How do you feel about Barker being released? I think you know how I feel. The guy's guilty. You're not as easy to read as you think, Gabriel. You should go. You think? I think. Get a bucket and some towels, please. Come on, baby. Come on, come on. Yeah, that's it, that's it. We should roll her over on her side. Mm... You've got blood on your shirt. You always hated it, anyway. Which is weird, because you bought it for me. Where did you find her? You don't want to know. - This is your fault. - Oh, Christ...! And how could you...? - Bringing her with you? - We're over, since the attack. And if it wasn't for Elaine, I would never have found Hannah. I needed her help, OK? Her help? SHE SCOFFS - Right...! - Give me a break. I found her, didn't I? I checked out of my own investigation. Well, finding her isn't the point. If you knew what was about to happen to her, it's a pretty important point. The point is...why she did this. Does she know? What I did? Or what you did? She doesn't, does she? Tell me she doesn't know! - Synced & Corrected by Dragoniod - www.addic7ed.com Rellik 1x02 "Episode 03 " Sep 25 , 2017. RAIN POURS DOWN You've hardly said a word to me. You shouldn't be here. I want to be here. With you. Is that what you really want, love? Of course. I love you. I love you, too. Come on... HE YAWNS Jesus, Brian. - Sorry, I know I'm late. - Again. Are you Brian Sweeney? Yeah. You're a hard man to get hold of, Brian Sweeney. We've been calling, had people go by your house... Oh, sorry, er... ..the phone ran out of credit. It happens, doesn't it? Have you been drinking, Brian? You try working nights without a drink. What's this about? - Were you on shift this morning? - Till nine. Why? I want to ask you something. - Did you see this woman at all? - Mrs Barker? Yeah, early this morning. Almost at the end of my shift. She and her husband were having a few...words, so she stormed out in a hurry. And did you see her return? No. Me and Patrick, we chatted till about eight. He was feeling bad about not taking the time off work. Then he went upstairs and I got back to the desk. Are you sure you didn't see her come back? I'd spent that long talking about her, I'd have noticed. I mean, a job like this, long shifts, people nod off. It's not a crime. It's just we need to be sure. I'm telling you, she didn't. What's this about? Rebecca Barker was found murdered this morning. So let me ask you again. Are you absolutely sure about everything you've told us? Cos this is a murder case. And we suspect Mrs Barker is the latest victim of the acid killer. Yes. Yes. God, I swear. Wait, erm... Listen. I was just recording something. A book I'm working on. RECORDING: The concierge shuddered with leafy joy as her fulsome bosom pressed against his... Sorry. Bit later... RECORDING: Love had placed him on a different spiritual plane to us... For Christ's sake, Rebecca! Rebecca... Look, stop being like this! Come back. That's Mr Barker. Rebecca! Calling after his wife. I saw him going after her. It says the time it was recorded here, too. 7:07. - And that was recorded sitting here? - Yes. - And they were...? - Going down the stairs. OK. Thank you for your time. Goodnight, boss. Are you sure there's nothing else I can do? Well, is there something else that you think you should be doing? Well, there's not exactly... Barker's being watched. Mike and Asim are checking his alibi. Gabriel's... Well, you know? No. No, er...enlighten me. You know, his daughter. He had to, er... Him and Elaine, they, er... Did he not talk to you? So what about his daughter? Maybe he should tell you himself. It sounded important. More important than getting a confession from a guy who's killed six people and burned them beyond recognition with hydrochloric acid? Well, he was worried about her. His daughter. That's all I know. Sam... Do you think what you're doing is smart? Sorry? I don't know what you mean. Oh, you know what I fucking mean. Do you think what you are doing is smart? I, er... I don't, erm... It's just a rhetorical question. Go on, piss off. LOUD CLUB MUSIC Yep? Gabriel, I just heard you had to check out of the investigation today. Yeah, look, I didn't have a choice. It's Hannah, OK? So don't go crawling up my arse on this. I know it's Hannah. And it's serious or you wouldn't have signed off. I'm just calling to see if I could help. Really? Yeah, yeah, really. I'm worried about Hannah, too. I know she's been in a dark place before. And don't worry, we'll catch this fucker. Sure. Thanks, Ed. Have you seen this girl? No, mate. The barman says she was here with Cassie, but left hours ago. We should try nearby bars, pubs. No need. I've got a friend in Digital Forensics. I asked him to look into Hannah's ChatsApp account. And? She messaged Cassie saying she was at a rave at a club in the City. I've got the address. - When did she send the message? - Before we talked to Cassie. - She lied to us. - Of course she did. And, Gabriel... ..there's a lot of talk, and maybe it's just talk, but she says in the message... "I want to get fucked up." Drop me at my car. Screw that. Unless you don't want my help all of a sudden. Which would be stupid, cos you need it... ..evidently. CAR ENGINE STARTS: All right, then. Jesus Christ...! What the fuck?! Mr Barker... We're very sorry you've been here so long. Would you like someone to take you back to your place? So I'm free to go, am I? You were always free to go. We just wanted you to... Answer your questions, yes. I'm not stupid, Detective. And have you spoken with Brian Sweeney? We have, yeah. Good. We're very sorry for your loss, Mr Barker. Just do your job. Find whoever did this. That guy creeps me out. Unfortunately, creeping you out isn't grounds for arrest. Patrick Barker has left the building. Where are you on the other leads? No connections I can find to the other body we've identified. Mrs Barker worked away a lot, she didn't make any enemies. Keep checking. You do that when you're nervous. If anything happens to Hannah, it's because of me. No, it's because of us. We made a mistake. We won't make it again. Right. Because we haven't already tried that. Maybe we haven't tried hard enough. I can't even look at myself any more, let alone be with someone. Let's just find your daughter. I know what she means to you. And what you mean to me. I know you're still dealing with what happened to you. But I'm here for you, Gabriel. LOUD CLUB MUSIC Have you seen this girl? Jesus, is that real? I need you to tell me if you've seen this girl. It's real. The girl? No. No! - Have you seen this girl? - No, mate. Hey, have you seen this girl? Shit...! You're a long way from Mordor, ain't ya? I'm DCI Gabriel Markham. If you don't answer the fucking question, you're in trouble. Have you seen this girl? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen her round here somewhere... Argh! Urgh! Urgh! Urgh! Get the fuck out of here! Argh! Argh...! Gabriel... Stop! Gabriel! Stop, Gabriel! She's the reason you're here. I'm taking you home. HE SPEAKS BACKWARDS You're not going to like this, but can we talk about your childhood? My childhood? Mm, that's kind of cliche, even for you. Yeah, well, we've talked about a lot of things in these sessions. There's no harm in going back to basics. You know what happened to me. I don't want to go there again. Well, that's precisely why you should. Come on, we need to look for the light, the laughter. Why don't you tell me your happiest... ..happiest memory, Christine? Mm...I once set fire to the school gym. Please. Fine. If you have to know. At first... At first, I was afraid. I was petrified. ♪ Thinking I can live without you by my side... ♪ Yeah, OK. SHE HUMS THE SONG I will survive, Isaac. It's a very important message. If you don't take this seriously, I can't help you. I'm not crying for you again. I know it floats your boat, but I'm not that type of girl. For me... ..it was trains. Oh, come on...! No, I could watch them for hours. Then, this one day... ..a bad day at school... I used to get bullied quite a bit for a few years. I went down to the station in the pouring rain and I saw it. A steam 5699 Galatea. I mean, what's it doing there? Christ knows. I'd been wanting to see one since I started spotting. Now... ..right when I needed cheering up the most... ..there it was. Now, that is my happiest memory. What about yours? On Fridays, after school, me and my mum would always go to one of those coffee shops. You know, the smart ones with the...the sofas. And she'd get me to stick my hands down the sides, between the cushions... - Why do that? - Because of the money. There's always coins down there. Like, not much, but... ..it can add up. You know, like, maybe enough to buy a pack of sweets, or the chip shop, if we were lucky. But it didn't matter, buying anything. Not really. It was... It was me and her against the world. Finding our way through. You loved your mum. Despite everything. Piss off, man. You know, you've talked before about not feeling safe...growing up. It's interesting, you never talked about these times with your mum. It's easy to forget, isn't it... ..among all the shit, the times that it wasn't? So what happened to her? I mean, you've said that she... MAN: Don't touch me! WOMAN: Can I have some help here?! All right, stay... Save it. Take it... No, let him go, let him go. No, let him go. COMMOTION CONTINUES It's clean now, surely? We've been doing this all day... I'm just being careful. Can't leave any traces. The police won't even know it's her, right? Hopefully. But we can't be sure... ..of anything. "Best use of thought leadership, 2003." Me and the rest of the team, we laughed when they called and said we were shortlisted. And then we won. We pretended like we didn't care. But... ..I still have it. And I put it here... ..where everyone can see it. The lies we tell ourselves to keep ourselves sane... You should go. - I'll be back as soon as I can. - I know. Sally... Everything that happened here, there was no other way. No choice. You understand that, don't you? Hm? You must believe that. Shush, shush, shush... Don't cry, my love. Don't cry. Don't cry. Shush... Everything's going to be all right. Everything's going to be all right. DOOR CLOSES Thought I might find you here. I always hated the thought of being predictable. And yet you smoke here every day, same place, same time. - A creature of habit. - With a habit. Are you busy later? Boss... Got the postmortem. Already? Did they find anything? Yeah, get this, the victim had breast implants. So? So, apparently, every fake tit that goes into someone with low self-esteem has a serial number. No shit? We ran the serial number with the manufacturer and we got an ID. Rebecca Barker. 43. Married. - Have we notified the husband yet? - Not yet. Let's bring him in. I'm sorry, it's just, er... It's just when you've... ..when you've been married to somebody that long... ..they're just part of you, you know? I'm sorry. And, er... SHE CLEARS HER THROAT ..when was the last time you saw her? She works away a lot. And, er... She was on another trip and, er... I think her meeting had been cancelled. Of course, she just... All she wanted was for me to take the day. Erm... But I said I... I said I was busy. She was very angry. What time was this? That was about seven, I think. Seven. Just after seven. - Do you know where she went? - No. I... Well, I assumed she'd gone to call her sister or someone, but I don't know for sure. I don't know. I'm sorry. We have to ask, Mr Barker... Is there anyone who can account for your whereabouts from after she left, just after seven, till her body was found at a quarter to nine? Me? You think...? We have to ask. No, I understand that. Yes, of course you do. Ah, let me see... Well, there's Brian. Erm... Brian's the concierge in our block. Works from nine till nine, sees everybody in and out. And that's the only entrance? No, there's a residents-only car park in the basement underground. Brian definitely saw Rebecca leave. I spoke to him until about eight o'clock, off and on. What's his full name, your concierge? Brian Sweeney. He and Rebecca got along. Look, erm... Just... Just find... ..whoever did this, Detectives. Please. We appreciate you coming down here, Mr Barker. And if you don't mind waiting a little while longer, we have some more questions for you. Yes. Keep him here till we talk to Brian Sweeney. - You aren't buying what he said? - He's hiding something. Isn't everyone? We need to talk to this concierge, make sure his alibi holds up. In the meantime, I don't care what bullshit you come up with, just make sure Patrick Barker doesn't leave this building. How was the door-to-door? No-one anywhere nearby saw anything of any value. The usual, then. This bloody case, honestly... Oh...! SCREAMING ON THE PC LAUGHTER Oh...! Oh, you all think this is funny, do you? DOORBELL CHIMES Brian Sweeney? DCI Gabriel Markham. I need to talk to you. Nobody's home. Any joy? No. Well, he should be in shift soon. Maybe if we call... PHONE VIBRATES Hi. I'm in the middle of something. I still haven't heard anything from Hannah. Well, have you called her friends, other parents? Yes. It turns out Cassie Hughes skipped school today, as well. Shit. If she's with Cassie Hughes, then she's up to all kinds of things. Remember what happened last time? Lisa... You need to find her. I will. - Now. - I will, OK? Yeah. Everything OK? Do you mind if we make a stop before we look for Sweeney? Yeah, sure. I thought they were tearing this place down. Well, they're always talking about it. But the truth is, it costs too much. Cheaper just to let the whole thing decompose. LIFT DOOR CLANGS SHUT When I was a kid... ..I always thought it was going to get better. I don't know why I thought that. Maybe it's because, when you're young, everything's always changing. Everything's new, every experience. And it's hard to imagine that sometimes... ..progress just stops. That a place or a person... ..has become everything they're ever going to be. Or worse... ..they become less. You grew up here? I didn't know that. Well, now you do. Cassie? ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC ON TV KNOCKING ON DOOR Cassie, it's Gabriel. Hannah's dad. I want to talk to you. Cassie, you're not in trouble, I just need to talk to you. - Maybe she's not here. - That's hers. KNOCKING ON DOOR Cassie, I'm not going anywhere. What? - Where's Hannah? - I don't know. I don't know where Hannah is, yeah? I was watching that. You're not missing anything. Hannah's been gone from school all day. So have you. We're worried about her. I just want to know she's OK. She doesn't want to see you right now, yeah? Jesus, give her some fucking space. Hey! You know where she is, don't you? Tell me. Or what, you freak? Or I turn this place upside down. You ever spent the night in custody, Cassie? - It's no place you want to be. - Screw you. Cassie... Just tell us where she is and we'll leave you alone. I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. She came in this morning in a really weird mood. She said she just wanted to, like, get out of there and get hammered. And I was like, "Yeah, sure." Why? Why was she in a mood? Cos she knows the truth. About you. What do you mean? About your affair. Is it with her? Hm? Hannah said it was with a lady cop. CASSIE LAUGHS Oh, she's a bit out of your league, isn't she? Where were you drinking? Er, erm... LA Lounge. And did she say where she was going? A party. She knew about some big party. She said she'd text me later. But I haven't heard nothing. Well, when you hear, you tell me, OK? Or I'm coming back here with a patrol car. All right, all right. Jesus...! I'm sure she'll be fine. You don't mind her going to the kind of party where you get high and fuck, right? SHE SCOFFS DOOR CLOSES What was that? Hm... Her mum left when she was young. Her dad's a meth-head. I'd feel sorry for her if she didn't have such a shitty attitude. I don't mean Cassie. I mean when she said she knew the truth about you, you looked... ..terrified. And then, when she mentioned the affair, you looked relieved. What did you think she was talking about? What did you think Hannah knew? This thing's broken. Let's use the stairs. - OK, I'm ready. - You just stay there. Stay where you are. Don't come in here. What do you think? Ah... You need to put your hair up. Yeah. And turn around. Well... ..it'll just have to do. I always hated that hat. SWEENEY: But his mind was not focused. Love had placed him on a different spiritual plane to us mortals... For Christ's sake, Rebecca! Rebecca... Look, stop being like this. Come back! Rebecca! HE CHUCKLES I'm in trouble now. What have you done this time? Oh... You don't want to know, Brian. You don't want to know. FROM NEXT ROOM: For fuck's sake, why? Tell me why! I'm sick to death talking about it! You going off to work every day, standing side by side with her. Elaine is my partner. She's who I work with. I can't help that! - You can help who you sleep with. - Oh...! DOOR SLAMS MUSIC THROUGH HEADPHONES You don't have to be here. - I want to be. - It's not a good idea. You can't be objective about this any more. You shouldn't be leading this investigation. HE SIGHS: Are you saying you're going to take me off? Well... We've been friends a long time. I'm just looking out for you. If you take me off the case, our little arrangement at the safehouse goes to Professional Standards. HE SCOFFS Oh, there he is. There's the Gabriel I remember. You can be a real prick. Look, I'm not trying to scorch the earth here. It's just...I am worried about you, that's all. I'm fine. All finished? Sorry, sorry... Why won't you say? It's private. But you do admit that you're seeing someone? - Oh, a gentleman never tells. - Oh, come on! You're dressing better, you're coming into work smiling, for a change. Leave it, Andrea. I'm not going to say anything. Give me her name. Just her name. Ah... Fine. Fine. You be like that. I'll find out sooner or later. Excuse me. RAT SQUEAKS SHE SCREAMS HE LAUGHS What the hell...?! Don't forget to wash your hands! What is wrong with you? You know that I hate rats! - Chill out, relax. It's a joke! - A joke? You can call it a joke. But from where I'm standing, it feels a lot more like bullying. - What's going on here? - Nothing. Forget it. Jesus... He thought that it would be funny to put rats in the toilet. Oh, he's still pulling that shit? One more time... One more time and I will get him back. Oh, come on. You don't need to stoop down to his level. Not his level. I will do something that will scare the shit out of him. I'm telling you, one more time... Hey, Andrea... Pigs. He's shit-scared of them. For some insane reason, his parents decided to take him to a slaughterhouse when he was a kid. Ever since then, he's had nightmares about dead pigs. You shouldn't be here, so soon after what happened to you. Sorry. So the body was dumped in broad daylight. No CCTV. No anything. The place is a wasteland. What? I don't know. All the bodies we've had so far, they've been placed. Deliberately. Carefully. Right in the middle of whatever playground they're left in. They... It's like they're on show. This... It feels random, arbitrary. - You think? - And the scarring... ..it feels uneven. Well, maybe the killer was in a hurry. Yeah. Probably. Or what? Every body we've seen so far, it feels the same. This one doesn't. It feels different. What, like a...? Like a copycat? But... ..not all the murders have been the same. - The manner of death... - No, no. But the burns... That's the part our killer takes time over. This is all wrong. It's like a bad impression. You may be right. I think we're looking for two different killers here. MOANING AND PANTING MOANING GROWS LOUDER PASSIONATE MOANING AND PANTING Shit! What are you doing here? You shouldn't be... Get away from him. You need to come here, right now. Come here, come here. You don't understand, Mum. What's he done to you, love? It's not like that. I am an adult. I'm 20 years old and I love him. I know you don't want to hear that, but I do. Wait, Rebecca! - Rebecca, where are you going? - Where do you think I'm going? - You're going to call the police? - This has to stop right now! Look at you. You're abusing our daughter, you sick piece of shit! Shush...! She is not my daughter. She is your daughter. Your daughter. You sick shit! You raised her, Patrick! She's your little girl! Please... - There is nothing to say! - You need to calm down. You need to be locked up for the rest of your miserable little life! Mum! Mum, you can't tell anyone. You can't. I can't let you tell anyone. It's OK. You need help, love. I'm going to help you. No matter what he's made you believe, it's not the truth, OK? - I'm going to help you. - No. You think you can help me. You've never given a shit about me! I know what I'm doing. I'm not a child. SALLY SOBS You can't do this. I can't do what? Get in the way of us. "Get in the way of us"? Can you bloody hear yourself? I'm going to be sick. Aaarrgghh...! SHE SOBS Oh, fuck...! Oh, God... Oh, God...! Oh, God! - I'm sorry! - Shush... Don't cry. SHE SOBS - Don't cry. - I can't... Oh, God...! It's all right. It's all right, my love. Everything's going to be fine. SHE CONTINUES TO SOB Everything's going to be fine. I've been thinking... I think we need to make sure that nobody can ever trace this back to you. Even if we bury the body... ..we can't be sure. And we must be... ..completely sure we've gotten away with it. So... ..we make it look like one of these. And then she'll be just another anonymous victim. I didn't mean to... I just didn't want her to tell anyone. I just couldn't... I know, I know, I know. I know, Sally. But you have to be strong now. Will you be strong... ..my love? My love... We'll need to leave her body in a playground somewhere, just like the others. What if they find the real killer? The real acid murderer. They'll know he didn't do it. It'll be me they come looking for first. And I'll just... I don't know, I'll just get on a plane... ..get out of here. You stay and tie up the loose ends and then join me later. And then we just... ..never come back. We'll have our forever. - Synced & Corrected by Dragoniod - www.addic7ed.com
