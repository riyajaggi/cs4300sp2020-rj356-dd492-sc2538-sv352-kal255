 The time is 12.37am. Present are DCI Cadi John, DS Owen Vaughan... ...William Jenkins, solicitor... ...and state your name for the tape, please. Karl Lewis. Mr Lewis, a member of the public has come forward since we last spoke. And? They say they saw you at Geraint Elis's house... ...around the time he was murdered. What did you say? Were you near Geraint Elis's house... ...between 28th of February and the 4th of March? No. Who said that? We can't name them.

 Seriously? I wasn't near the place. This doesn't make sense. I wasn't there. Mr Lewis. Is there something we should know? No. No. Anything you'd like to tell us? No. OK. I'll tell you how it looks from this side of the table. Geraint Elis hurt you. He humiliated you. You were a young boy in his care and he abused his power. He lost his job, yes. He didn't pay. He wasn't really punished. It's hard to live with that... ...with the feeling that he didn't pay the price. The feeling grows and grows... ...day after day, until one night, you can't repress it. It wasn't like that. You went to his house to force him to apologize... ...make him see what he did to you. ...make him see what he did to you. No. Did you suddenly lose control? Did you suddenly lose control? Stop this. Was it good, after all those years, to take back some of the power? What made you kill him? What made you kill him? I didn't. I haven't done anything. It's only a theory. But someone saw you by his house. More than that, you had a motive to attack him. I have nothing to say. I don't know anything so I can't say anything. OK, listen. What? It wasn't like that. We've heard enough theories for one night, detective. Don't say another word, Mr Lewis. I need to consult with my client. OK. Go ahead. Then Mr Lewis can think it over in his cell. Interview terminated at 12.49am. Your client will remain in custody to await further questioning. Thanks. What do you think? What do you think? I don't know. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel right. Too neat. We'll let him sweat. Go home. We'll try again in the morning. OK. Goodnight. Thanks. See you tomorrow? What the fuck's going on? Just drive. Connor? Con. Good morning, wankers. How am I meant to get on with business with cops everywhere? Start a new business. Shut it. What the fuck does a kid like you know? Fuck off, Jason. Pathetic... ...the whole fucking family. Are we having a lift or what? Hiya, Beth. It's me. In work. Shit, sorry. I didn't think. Sorry. OK, we'll talk later. Good morning, boss. Three decades in the same school. This is the only complaint against Geraint Elis. No rumours, no accusations, nothing. One complaint destroyed his life. The school couldn't risk it. It was his word against Karl's. Why would Karl, who has a job, a girlfriend, his own life... ...why would he murder Geraint Elis now... ...after all this time? You don't think he did it? I don't know. He's hiding something. I'm not sure if it's this. Did we make the news? We're never in the news. We were when the Queen drove past on her Silver Jubilee... ...right outside. Listen, Beca. I'm worried this place will drive you mad. I'm OK. You never know. I'll put the kettle on. Jesus. Hello, garage? Of course. I know exactly where you are. Give me half an hour. I'm the only one here. Stay where you are. OK. Bye. Karl Lewis. I want to move things along. My solicitor should be here. Just listen, then. It can't have been easy to make the accusation against Geraint Elis. It changed everything. The way people looked at you, the way they behaved towards you. I can't imagine how hard that was. Once an accusation is made it's impossible to retract it. What are you trying to say? He was a highly respected teacher, and he hurt you. Why shouldn't he live a lonely life... ...hiding from everyone... ...alienated from his community... ...his career in tatters... ...his name dragged through the mud? But there was no choice. What? What? The truth had to come out. The truth is what counts... ...at whatever price. And then... ...Geraint Elis is murdered. The case takes us back to the beginning and to you. I didn't kill him. I really want to believe you, Karl. I really want to believe you, Karl. I didn't kill him. I had no reason to kill him. He didn't touch me. I made it up... ...because I wanted to get him into trouble. Can I go home now? Can I go home now? We need to interview you formally. You can go home once it's all on record. Karl Lewis didn't do it. I've just spoken to him again. There was no abuse. There was no abuse. No motive for murder. No. If we believe him. Alys, can I see the Karl Lewis witness details? Of course. Are you OK? Are you OK? Yes. I won't tell anyone. Don't worry. Why would I worry? Well, just... ...with Lee and everything. It's none of his business. I haven't said anything to him. I promise. You believe me, don't you? It's OK. I don't care what they think... ...Lee or Jason. You can't choose your family. No. I try not to let people get too close. It takes a long time for me to trust anyone. You can trust me. I hope so. Don't fall out with Lee. It isn't worth it. Hey. Hey. Hey. Nice morning to go out for a run. Nice morning to go out for a run. It's cold. Yes. Sorry, come in. Lucky you chopped the wood yesterday. Yes. Sorry if I was rude to you yesterday. It's OK, honest. I saw you coming back from your run. I thought maybe you'd be hungry. It's still warm. Thanks. You didn't have to. I'll just... Have you settled in? Yes. I haven't been here for years. Mam would sit there, waiting for Dad to finish in the shop. She'd have a cuppa waiting for him or a cold beer if he was lucky. Sounds nice. It was. For a while it was. I'd better get back to the shop. Who can tell me the reason for heating sulphuric acid? It speeds the reaction. Exactly. Introducing heat means any chemical reaction will... Mia, can you go with Miss Morgan, please? Thanks. As I was saying... Go back to the classroom after you've finished. Hi, Mia. Sit. Hurry, so we can go. Do what she says. I'm DCI John and this is DS Vaughan. I asked your mother to come. I think you know why we're here. Karl Lewis. You made a statement that you'd seen him near the crime scene. But it wasn't true. This is serious, Mia. Perverting the course of justice. Why did you lie? Mia? Because she's a little bitch. That's why. Karl's my ex. She has never liked my boyfriends. She has never liked my boyfriends. Do you know Karl? He used to stay over with Mam. He used to stay over with Mam. Jealousy, that's her problem. Miss Owen, please. Miss Owen, please. Ms to you if you don't mind. I've spoken to your headmistress. She says you're clever. You could go to college or university if you wanted. Making such an accusation could put a stop to everything. Did you want to get Mr Lewis into trouble? It isn't easy... ...to do my schoolwork with all the drama at home. Cheeky little bitch. Karl used to come to our house. Mam gave him a key. I was only fourteen... ...no, thirteen. He'd look at me. He'd look at me. Watch what you bloody say. Please. That's enough. The way he looked at me... Did he hurt you? No. But I never felt safe. He said things when Mam wasn't there. Did you tell anyone? I don't want you to think I was being spiteful. I knew straightaway I'd done something stupid. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. Are you going to charge her? We'll give you a warning. We'll give you a warning. Thank God. I'm gasping for a fag. I'll go after her. I'll walk you back to the classroom. I know Mam can be a bit... ...but she tries her best. The way they treat her - I just lost it. I can see it isn't easy. Sorry. OK. Hey. You're OK. Let's go. Mia. Geraint Elis, the man on the estate. Were you aware of any trouble? No, sorry. I wish I could help. Off you go. We've spoken to your father's accuser. We asked him about the case... ...the abuse allegation. He admitted it was a lie. He made the whole thing up? Everything. If it wasn't Karl Lewis, then who? We don't know. We're doing all we can to find out. All those years... ...listening to what other people said. The only person I should've trusted was Dad. I wanted you to know. I appreciate that. Hey, stop that. You can't smoke here. You can't smoke here. Who's smoking? Put them away. It's dangerous. Put them away. It's dangerous. Chill out. Hey! Hey! It's OK, Dad. Give that to me. Don't be stupid! You stop being stupid. That's enough. Give them to me. Don't be stupid. Are you OK? Yes. Yes. Is she your girlfriend? She doesn't know the half of it. Shut up. Did he ever tell you he'd been in jail? Naughty boy. Drop it. Don't be so childish. Get lost. Get lost... ...before I phone the police. Come on, Dad. Let's go. OK. Ready to start again? House-to-house enquiries. House-to-house enquiries. I know. Jesus! Here he is. What does he want? DCI John. They said you were on your way back. I wanted a word. Of course. Do you need me? Do you need me? It's OK. I'll start the enquiries. I'll start the enquiries. This way, Mr Rhys. I knew there was something... ...something missing in Gwilym's life. I didn't do enough. When you came yesterday... ...it all came back. When Gwilym Scott first came to the youth centre... ...I could see he was struggling. I thought if I could be there for him... ...I could make a difference. Save him. I made an effort with Gwil. Made time to get to know him, to listen. I felt I was making ground... ...that I was reaching him, somehow. Then one day, he just stopped coming. Do you know why? His foster parents said everything was fine. I let it go. I didn't go back after that... ...not once. Then he was gone. Then I heard he was being targeted. What do you mean? What do you mean? Cyberbullying. That's what they call it. Anonymous emails, nasty comments on social media... ...was enough to make him... I tried finding out who was behind it. I accused a few lads... ...said things I shouldn't have. You can't protect them all. You can't protect them all. It was my job. It was my responsibility - and that's still with me. It always will be. Does grief last forever? It has to. Otherwise, what does losing someone mean? I don't get invited to many parties nowadays. I appreciate you coming in, Mr Rhys. If you hear anything... ...phone me. Hiya. Hey. I thought I'd check how you and your father are... ...that you're both OK. Thanks. He's OK. I just talked to him. He's in front of the fire, with a whisky. The third by now, probably. Good. I'm glad. And you? I wanted to check. I'm sure today was hard. Yes. I've never seen him like that... ...someone having a go at him. He has always looked after me, especially after Mam. Well, he looked after you today. Look... Yes? I was in prison for two and a half years. You don't have to. You don't have to. I want to. I killed a mother and daughter. I drove when I was drunk. I took their lives. I'll never forgive myself. No-one else should forgive me either. After today, I just wanted you to know. And now I do. Goodnight. Goodnight. Welcome to your voicemail. You have no new messages... ...and one saved message. Saved message. Sorry, I was in the garden. If it isn't too late, I'll have steak and kidney pie. Thanks, love. See you later. Anything useful from Mr Rhys? Maybe, we'll see. How about you? We'll go out again, work harder. There's a body lying in the morgue. The DNA samples don't say a lot. We've just released our only suspect. Someone did this... ...someone with a motive. ...someone with a motive. It doesn't always work like that. Sometimes, things happen for no reason. We'll get there. I'm going home. What about you? Maybe. Goodnight. Hello. Why are we back here? Mia? It's OK, Con. Just a bit of fun. Teach the fuckers a lesson. Coming? Drink? Shit. What the fuck are you doing? You need to go. Hiya. Get out, now. Why were you mean to me earlier? What are you talking about? You know nothing about me. Get out. Don't touch me.
