 You're fucking a pussy! You're getting annoying, you know? Oh come on. Tell me that wasn't fun. It's very disappointing. You're going to let everybody down. Well you better call your grandmother and explain why you're missing the hunt. She bought that bay for you, and she's not going to... Mr Bowen, good to see you. Judith. Oh Jesus! Oh don't panic, David. We weren't exactly getting anywhere, were we? - Go time. - I was just... Please, if you would just listen... You're the Dean of Students, aren't you? We came here because we want to know what you're planning to do about problematic teaching materials.

 Yes, thanks Gemma, and thank you for your emails. Is it still mostly the twentieth century history photographs that you are finding... problematic? It's across the board. Where are our safe spaces? Where are the trigger warnings? If I had epilepsy then you'd warn me about flashing lights, wouldn't you? Yes, absolutely, I do understand. I feel like I'm at constant risk of attack every time I come to uni. Physical attack? Do I need to be punched in the face before someone takes my feelings seriously? Alright, alright. Everyone here has the right to learn in complete safety. So do your job and protect us then! Exactly! I said I would listen to you, and you have been very forthright... Not just myself, but the entire university has all your interest at heart. You've been very clear and I appreciate your frankness. Darlin'... Darlin'! Darling'! Darling'! - What can I get you? - A Malbec please. Don't try and pull that shit. I'm right here, sweetheart. - What's your name? - Joe. What's yours, beautiful? Joe, you have to stop screeching, okay. You're not a toddler. I'm just trying to get a drink, bitch. Maybe if you did your fucking job... Bye, Joe. Malbec, right? Everyone who comes here has an IQ of 4. You come here. It's on my way home. And your wifi works. Students usually work in student pubs that's all. How d'you know I'm a student? Just a guess. What can I get you? Where have you been, Hol? Booze started already. - Alright, shots. - Cheers! - You're two behind, catch up. - No, I'm good, thanks. - Oh come on! - Leave her be. Round two? Ready to go? - Okay fine, go on. - Here you go. Okay, here, get in, ready. Three, two, one. Oh man! Are you coming to join us? Just a tiny one. - Right. See you guys later. - See you later! It's Holly McStay, right? Why did you pretend not to know who I am if you do? I read about you last year. Knowing your name doesn't mean I know you. Tell that to the rest of the world. For what it's worth, I think what you did to expose those bankers was amazing. I gotta go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I just think we might have something in common, that's all. I don't think so. Wait wait wait wait wait. - Tell me you haven't stopped serving. - What the fuck?! Oh god, I can see it on your face. Don't lie to me! - Aubrey, get off her. - Not till we get our drinks. Just leave her alone. Why do you always have to harrass her? We're closed. No! Bad luck, boys. Want someone to walk you home? What city do you think we're in? I meant company, not bodyguard. I'm alright, thanks. Hey! We going somewhere else or...? - Nah, we're already pissing her off. - Don't be sensitive. You're at our uni right? What's your name? Theresa. Liar. Guys! Fucking gold, old man. Okay. Where you're from? Right wing provocateur Jay Galatas has been banned from speaking at yet another university. Mr Galatas spoke with reporters outside his house. Mr Galatas, how do you respond to a number of cancellations we just found out about? Every time a university cancels me, my book sales go through the roof. They're doing me a gorgeous, lucrative favour. What do you say to the accusation that your views are dangerous? I love corrupting kids. Just not in the way the universities are so worried about. Do you thinks this is an attack on the free speech? Do you have any interesting questions for me? INTERNS TESTIFY IN MCDERMID TRIAL Just asking people about microaggression today. Is saying 'god bless you' a microaggression? Saying 'god bless you' when someone sneezes is a microaggression. Some people have different religions. How about 'I believe the most qualified person should get the job'? Yes... it is a microaggression because it's not just about qualifications. What is it about? I wanted to push for an answer, but I didn't want to be aggressive... Micro-aggressive. Wait, I'll read you what I said, hang on. Do it. I'm all ears. - You don't mind? - No, I'd like that. Where is it... Oh here it is. Further to our previous correspondence, I wondered whether you would consider attending our speakers festival, where many, many women would surely benefit from your amazing achievements and insight. Yes! So... confident! - Hey, Holly! - Sorry. Am I interrupting? Fuck no, you live here! We were brainstorming ideas for house night out though if you've got any ideas? No... I'm easy. - Morning. - Hey. Fraser made some pancakes. They're like, seriously good. I made too many, like always. Come and sit down. - Oh no... - I'm alright, actually. I'll see you guys later. Shit, sorry Holly, it's all my rubbish. Oh, no, you're good. I gotta go hand in an essay anyway. Okay, have a good one. She must just be busy. - It's like living with puppies. - You told me to get randoms. What do you care anyway? You're barely here. Feeling neglected? I'm like your 1950's housewife, waiting by the door... Except I don't even get an occasional fuck. Hey, we should start meeting for lunch again. We never met for lunch. Oh my god, just play along. Meet me for lunch. Fine! Hey, just me, sorry. S'okay. I wanted to say sorry, if we seem like we're all over you with this housemates thing. - No, you don't. - Great. I was shitting it a bit. I read everything they wrote about you last year. Is that weird for you? A bit. Everyone thinks you're amazing. You're brave. I'm trying to be braver this year. You know I run a society right, Women Rise? - You'd be great for it. - I've really gotta get going. - Can I borrow this? - Sure. Don't you think Fraser wants to bang me? It's gonna be so great, Hols. - Hey, Barney, they put up. - Sweet. That Ben guy, he put it on his site. UNI SNOWFLAKES TRIGGERED BY... SNOWFLAKES What a headline. I'm a wordsmith, what can I do? It seems that Edinburgh students can now add paper to the list of things that will cause them to have a nervous breakdown at university. Fuck-sake, Barney. So if you were hoping for a week on campus where you weren't screamed at by the offended sheeple... Aw man, Barney, they're gonna come to our house. Then maybe stay home this week. The offence-brigade are out in force to make sure we think nothing, say nothing, and learn nothing. Hey, get your own. - Well, this is gross. - Hey, whatever gets people talking. - Whatever. - Thank you. - It's Jack, by the way. - Holly. I know. Did you write that article? No, no. I'd make excuses for Barney but they probably wouldn't be true. - It bother you? - I've got a lecture. - Skip it. - No. Okay, well don't spare my feelings now. What do you want? A shit pint in a shit pub? Holding hands at the cinema, what? That sounds nice. But hey, you have a lecture. I'll see you, Holly. Welcome to Twitcher. We tell the truth. Or try to. Just click through some links. If you're someone who makes content, or wants to start, get in touch. You can find an application form on our website. Otherwise, you can find us on all forms of social media... Shit, lunch, I'm sorry. Lou, come on, I lost track. You think I don't know why you moved in with me? Uh, maybe because we're friends? You moved in with me because you knew I'd leave you alone. Lou, things are actually going alright for me. Right, because you carefully maintain a sparkly Insta profile. Holly, you don't do anything. You've got no friends and no life. Wow. Last year was really fucked up... I'm not asking you to tell me everything. What are you asking then? I'm having someone round tonight, a girl I like. And I'm gonna ask Rayna and Fraser to join us. Okay. You realise I'm asking you to be there too? - Is that a yes? - Bye, Louise. WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSITY PORTAL STUDENT INFORMATION DIRECTORY HOLLY MCSTAY For later. - I'm sorry, I feel really old. - No! Yeah. I can't fucking wait to be 24! Are you kidding? No! It's, like, so proper, you know? Sophisticated. You're so wrong. I'd fucking kill to be a student again. Shit! So, what does Louise usually cook? Right, so the food is fucked, but there's wine, so we're good, right? - Yeah, don't worry, babe. - Anything will be great. - What do you think of Dani? - Yeah she seems nice. Is that it? When I met you you were wearing a thousand pound suit and outperforming the richest men in the country. Yeah, remember what happened next? Right, don't judge me okay? So everyone's coming tomorrow, right? What's happening tomorrow? Hello? Women Rise speaking festival? Rayna's organised the whole thing herself. It's gonna be brilliant. Holly? Yeah? You should come tomorrow. Okay. Sure. I mean to speak. You should speak, you have a lot to offer. Here you go. You know, when we first became friends, Holly told me about what she'd been through, how she'd managed to literally take down a whole... Rayna, we met each other five minutes ago, you don't know anything about me, okay? I'll go. Rayna... I'm sorry. I shouldn't be smoking weed, it makes me feel weird. Alright, lads? It's okay. I'm gonna crash. ...remember, everyone, the change starts with you. So, thank you for having me. Thank you, Madeleine. Brilliant! Hey, Holly. - Want one of these? - No, I'm good. It's nice that you came. ...so stick around. I'll tell you what, ladies. What don't I just jump in? Why not? He's not supposed to... I don't understand. Hello beautiful babies. What the fuck is Jay Galatas doing here? I've been asked to talk to you about gender of all the frightful things. So here goes. Buckle up. The thing that really strikes me about the gender debate, and let's be clear now, that basically means women talking loudly, is this: if there is a Patriarchy, then women should be grateful. - Let's just go. - Why should we? He has no right... Guys, you're so... Wow. Yeah, I know. What you need to realise is that to all the lovely ladies around you you're just a rapist in waiting. If you speak up against them you'll be attacked by a bunch of angry libtards. Gents, you are the victims of gender inequality... You have no right to be here. Get out. I'm sorry, darling. Am I doing the wrong type of speaking? You see how illustrates my point entirely? Feeling sad? Patriarchy! Not rich enough? Patriarchy! Regret your drunken fuck? Patriarchy! Sit down, sister. People pay a lot of money to hear what I've got to say. You're not allowed to just... I'm not allowed? Don't they teach free speech here? Probably not. Sit down? How can we help you, Jay? What are you here to talk about exactly? - Oh another one! - No, seriously. I mean, two years ago you were on the national news, and now you're doing open mic in a student union. Fucking hell! Bookings must have really dried out. - Can't help being controversial. - You're not controversial, Jay. You outed yourself as a fame-hungry attention seeking twat and then you became irrelevant. Everyone here is really fucking bored of what you've got to say, so just hurry up, will you? Go on. Oh was that all? Okay, well fuck off then. Hang on! Fuck off! Hang on! Okay, Holly, so that was phenomenal. - Did you bring that cunt here? - It wasn't us. Then why are you here? Shock horror, a little bit of provocation at uni. - Didn't you have fun? - Holly... - You wanna go? - Hey... We're having a party at the beach later. You should come. Piss of, mate. - That went well. - Did the trick, though. So close, mate. - Where are you out to? - You'll see. Haven't seen badass Holly for a while. Where'd she come from? Leave me alone, Lou. No hugs and kisses then? Bring me anything? No. Where've you been? I've just been really busy. Did your therapist tell you to stop coming, or Louise? Oh, it was Louise. That little cunt. I stopped coming because I didn't want to see you, Rachel. Why? I keep your secrets. I think that's enough. You mean how we killed someone? That's your secret too, babe. So why are you here? - You miss me. - No. Yeah, you do. I'm the only one you tell the truth to. I met someone... There's something weird about him, about the people he's with. I thought you looked good. Fucking nutters always suited you. Sorry... okay? Sorry. I'm listening. Things have been good, you know. Normal. I go to work. I go to uni. Louise leaves me alone. And then today I just... - What's going on? - Nothing... I just lose my balance around her. You mean you stop pretending to be a boring little uni student. - I'm not doing anything. - Not yet. I don't know why I'm here. Because you wanna know whether to fuck this guy or kill him. Maybe both? Sometimes I forget that you are truly insane. You came because you're turned on. I can see it in your face. You're ready to go. Why not just stop pretending? - Okay, so why are we here again? - Because you were right. I'm sick of hiding in my room, being worried all the time. I'm bored. - Where did you get that? - Bartender perks. Wait, what? She's here. Great. We'e going all in. - Okay now, this feels like school. - Oh my God... Why did you guys come? Rayna wanted to go out. She was upset... I thought I should come too and make sure she was okay. She seems fine now. Yeah, you guys came too so... I'm gonna need more alcohol for this. Are you going in? YOU DON'T SMOKE So did you book Galatas then? Would it be such a huge deal if I did? So you're into the shit he says. Wanting to know what someone's got to say isn't the same as agreeing with them. - He humiliated my housemate. - You annihilated him for it. Didn't it feel a bit good? It was a bit fun. What the fuck is your deal? You managed to listen to Jay Galatas speak without being 'triggered' and having a nervous breakdown. What does that mean? Everyone knows what happened to you last year. And what, I passed your triggering test? No! God, I just meant... For Christ's sake... You always been this arrogant? Does knowing I'm right make me arrogant? Yeah. - I didn't book him, Holly. - It's still not funny. You're smiling. I don't usually turn up at people's houses, you know. - Am I supposed fired by that then? - I just really like you. It is pointless to make it more complicated than it is. Have some fun Holly. Come on. You've got problems. Feeling better? Who knows. Jack can have that effect on people. Did you meet at uni? No, we go further back. He's my brother kind of... Is it just me or is he a bit mental? Well, the internet says you are. We like that. Fuck! I can't watch her anymore. Can we please take her home. Just go. Okay. - Rayna, we're leaving. - I'm gonna stay. Come on, we can share an Uber. I'm fine, Holly. Let's go. No! Rayna!
