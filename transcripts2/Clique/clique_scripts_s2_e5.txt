 You were so powerful. You were the most powerful girl I'd ever known. I was so scared of who I was. You made it okay. For the first time in my life, I knew there were other people like me because you were like me. I've been getting you to the right place. It's okay to be scared. I'll help you. It's just us now.

 Hol. Fuck! _ Holly? Holly. I know this is so hard, but I need you to tell me everything you can. Agnes... Agn... Agnes has been... manipulating Rayna... Agnes... and she... she killed... She killed Louise 'cause she... She fucking knew that she was gonna tell the police, and then... Agnes wasn't driving that car, Holly. She saw it happen, just like you did. Okay, okay... You're okay, you're okay... No, please, I can't... Okay, okay, deep breath. Breathe. Just breathe, okay? Matt, not now, please. - Where do you want the other one? - Please tell me what's happening. Holly! Why were you there? Well, Louise called me. - She said she wanted to talk... - She knew what you did! You wanted to stop her from... - No, no, no... Tell them! Tell them what you did! Fuck off! Tell them what you did! Hey, what happened? Holly, where is she? Hey... Tell me, tell me... Girls, let's go inside. I need to talk to you all. What did you do? What did you do? What did you do? She was just here. I was touching her a few hours ago. I don't understand what's happening. Me neither. So you're telling me Agnes did all of this? Manipulated Rayna into framing her own son and tried to cover it up? Doesn't make any sense. I knew Agnes. She's weak, desperate to be important, but she's not a murderer. - Dani... - Tell me again. Tell me all again. Louise was going to meet Agnes. She found out Agnes was Will, the one manipulating Rayna. - She was going to go to the police. - So Louise knew too much? But Agnes wasn't driving the car. She didn't kill her. Why didn't Lou tell me what was happening? - I could've helped. - It's not your fault. No? Well, whose then? Because it's someone's fucking fault! I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. No. Police have appealed for calm after a 23-year-old woman was killed in a hit-and-run incident in the early hours of this morning. Police have not yet named the victim, but early social media reactions appear to have identified her as Louise Taggart, a popular student influential within the Women Rise campaign. Wait! Holly! Where are you going? - Just go back inside. - You can't do that. - You can't just leave me in the house. - Go to your mum's then. No. You don't get to fight me off anymore. - This is happening to both of us. - This isn't about you anymore, Rayna. Grow up. It's about finding Will. - Louise wanted us to help each other out. - She's dead. Well, maybe if she'd spent more time listening to me rather than running around after Jack Yorke... Sorry. - I'm looking for Sergeant Cullen. - And you are? - Can you just get her out here? - She's not here right now. So if you could tell me what the problem is, I could help you. - Who's Will? - We met online. He wanted to help me. He said we could make people listen. Come on, Holly, work harder. The Twitcher guy? The car gets us back to Mr. Ben Howard. Matches the description. Just get there fast, okay? On my way. 32, Evans Road. For fuck's sake. This is ridiculous. Fucking coward! - Get him in the car! - Louise was too clever for you! - Fuck off! - You're so fucking stupid! She found you out! When you figure this out, you're gonna feel... If it is him, he'll pay. Do you hear me? Where are you running to now? Are they right? - Ben killed Louise? - She found Will. It was Ben, not Agnes. - I thought Ben was trying to help me. - No. No, he was just using you and Rayna to start this bullshit gender war. So everyone's a liar? How are you still playing the victim, Jack? How do you think Ben managed to manipulate Rayna into all of this shit? This whole thing started when you decided to destroy her in freshers'. - I never touched her. - Stop it. I saw it. She told me how it ended. How you punished her for laughing at you. What did she say? Think about it, Holly. I swear to God, if you try and fucking confuse me again! I made a mistake letting myself fall for you. But I let you go, and... And I was about to be free of all of it. I was gonna be alright, and Louise was gonna make... Louise was gonna make it all okay. Take responsibility, Jack. Alright? Own it. Because it's yours and it's mine, and that's the only thing we're ever gonna share now. _ The family of Edinburgh student Louise Taggart have spoken this morning of their horror and devastation at her death last week. Miss Taggart was killed in a hit-and-run incident last Tuesday. Police have been unable to comment on the nature of the incident, but initial reports suggest that... Holly? Ken says you were in buying booze. Says you were rude. Ken's a prick. Is that it? Sorry I'm not helping. I'm trying, alright? Hollypop? Go away, Dad. You're ready to go. I can see it in your face. No. No, no. Quiet, please. Why did you call this press conference? Have you been charged? All the charges have been dropped. My client will make a brief statement. Thank you. This is a lesson for any man thinking of speaking up in a country that only protects women. They do not like it when you tell the truth, and they will come for you with every tool in their arsenal. That includes trying to frame you for murder. Do not underestimate the influence of the White Western woman in power. She is not fighting for equality. She is fighting to silence and destroy descent. - That's all we have for today... - I'm gonna speak plainly because no one else will. Mr. Howard, how do you account for your car? My car was stolen. It's as simple as that. That's it! Mr. Howard has no more to say about this! He has an alibi, Holly. It checks out. - There's nothing more we can do. - Who's the alibi, sorry? - I can't tell you that. - Louise found Will. - Why can't you guys? - We're trying! They're having trouble with the tech. It's sophisticated. - Louise managed. - So will we. Can any of you do your fucking jobs or are you all incompetent, huh? Sorry, you just let a murderer walk out of your doors, are you okay with that? You know what a rat does? Right before you kill it? It struggles. It struggles hard right before it loses. You're way off, Holly. Just like every other stupid bitch I know. Get out. _ What do you want, Holly? You need to actually say it. You see? It's nice. It's nice out here. You don't have to do this. You're all messed up. Why is that your problem? Why are you back here? Tell me. I don't get what you want. There's nothing to tell. Just tell me what you came back for. What you need from me. What do you want? I came back here to decide something, alright? Well, whatever it is that's fucking you up, - you need to sort it out. - What, like you? Mum died what? - Fifteen years ago? - That's enough. Her face cream is still on your bedside table. You haven't worked this boat in years. All of your friends have dropped you. You can't even say her fucking name, Dad! I mean, what... - Tell me, what have you done? - Yeah, well, you're not like me, are you? You're like her! - How would I know? - Oh, don't give me that shit! You remember her! She wouldn't let anything fuck about with her! Oh yeah, made it hard to live with her sometimes, but hey! She got things sorted, she put things right. For us! Whatever it took! Now you can tell me you don't remember that, but you're full of shit! Because you are the same as her! So if you have something to decide, you do it. Alright? You're too young to be giving up, darling. Okay? Right. Let's see if there's any fish left in this cesspool, hey? Dad? I'm home. Which home? Ours. Can you hear the sea? You told me to tell you when. Yes. You should come. You should come home. Why weren't you inside? I didn't want to upset anyone. Pussy. Maybe I should've taken her to London with me. Being around you seems to have its drawbacks. I just wanted to be her friend. She said the same thing about you. So why are you letting her down? What's happened to you? You stopped Alistair last year. You made sure he was punished. Find out who did this. Find out who did this to our girl, and fix it. She was the only good one. There's been an overwhelming response to my false arrest. I figured the best way to address you all was to show you around. Tell you a little bit about the plans we have here at Twitcher. We started by making news content. I guess it was borne out of a frustration I had... What are you doing? I had an image in my head of who I was talking to online. Of Will. And when I look at Ben, I don't understand how it could've been him. It doesn't make any sense. What if we missed something, Holly? Hello? Hello? Calum. Why are you here? What are you doing? I can't be here anymore. My mum is barely holding it together. So you're going home then? That's where I should've been in the first place. Ben, fucking Twitcher... - All this fucked up shit over... - Over Jack. It's my job to protect him. I knew it was happening again. Like before. The blackouts? Well, that's... That's what we call them to make it more okay. Calum... When we were 15, he tried to hurt Agnes. She was sleeping at night, and he was so angry. Calum? I thought he was gonna kill her. Oh, my God, Calum! Oh, my God! Where is he? I had to stop him. He told me the blackouts had stopped. He's lying. I'm not sure what Jack may have done. Do you know where he is? No. Do you know where he is? I'm not doing this. Calum, stop! Calum... Calum! - What's that? - I was gonna leave it for you. Fuck-off-forever money? I've been protecting you. Not asking questions. Covering for stuff. This is my fault that... And now you're done? Holly says I have to start taking responsibility. For Rayna, Ben, Louise. All of it. Just tell me, Jack. I thought mum framed me, Calum. Tried to destroy me. Made me lose my mind. So you wanted to punish her? Yeah. Yeah, I did. - It's not a good time. - I don't care. So what? Do I need to perform for you, Holly? - What do you want? - Calum told me. About you making him lie about Jack for years. Making him cover up how dangerous he is. I think it's time you left my boys alone. God, you... You really fucked up, Agnes. Being a mum. You fucked them both. Just leave us alone. Just wait, okay? Just wait until she's gone. I just can't... I just can't deal with this right now. I don't care. Sit down and listen to this. I don't want to hear it. Mum! You need to listen to this, okay? Calum, would you just slow down? It's a lot to take on. Let's start again. I don't understand. Why did you record what he was saying? Because you need to know. You need to hear it from him. What he's done. What he was trying to do. He thought I had him framed for sexual assault. Of course he was furious! Of course he would've said stuff about me! It's much more than that, and you know it. He tried to hurt you before. This is much worse than once. - He... - No, Calum! I told him where you were going that night! I made a mistake. I should've known what he was planning to do. He was... He was just waiting for you to be alone! He didn't know Louise was gonna be there. He thought she was you. Ben Howard killed Louise. No. You know this. You know who he is. - He told... - No, Calum, don't, don't, no! I wanted to humiliate Mum at the election. For everyone to know who she is. And when I stopped you... I wanted it to be over! I wanted to be free! I thought it was Mum! I really thought it was Mum. But it was Louise! You killed her, Jack! What do I do? Where do I go? Don't, Agnes, don't! Here! There! It's gone! We're not doing this. It's gone. You heard it! You heard what he said! I came back here to decide something! You should come home. _ Rachel! You have one new message. It's me. Calum, I'm sorry for all of that. I'm with Holly. I'm gonna try and make it right. It's okay if you don't wanna call back. I love you. Message deleted.
