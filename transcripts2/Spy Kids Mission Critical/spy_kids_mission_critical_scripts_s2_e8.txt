 [Golden Brain] What does it mean, Lieutenant? [peaceful music playing] [softly] What does it all mean? Is something the matter, sir? [Golden Brain groans] -[Therese] Mr. Brain! Mr. Brain! Hi. -[Lieutenant grunts] Okay, it's time for our weekly meeting. [Golden Brain groans] Okay, so let's start with the gripe box I put in the break room. Let's see, the bathroom is clogged, the fridge is moldy again, and, oh... Oh, look at this.

 We've had multiple requests for a soft-serve machine. Hmm. I know this is supposed to be anonymous, but truth be told, those requests are from me. -[laughing] -[Golden Brain groans] Mr. Brain, why the one-way ticket to Frown Town? Is your dolphin net injury acting up again? [Golden Brain sighs] Therese, Therese, Therese. Agent No-One's mission is taking longer than anticipated. I mean, Agent Noone's mission is taking longer than anticipated. And even if old Noone can close the deal, I still need more funds to construct that Isochamber. All is lost, dear Therese. All. Is. Lost. Meeting adjourned. [groans]

 All is not lost, Mr. Brain. Not if I can help it. Not if I can help it. [straining] Come on, only a bit longer. You know, I-I really have been enjoying our weekly daddy-daughter time, Scorpy, but... [whimpering] why yoga again? It has many benefits, Father. [Davebot] Om. Blitzen! -Om. -[grunts] Now for Upward Spastic Spider Monkey. [whimpers] But... But that's the hardest pose. Yes, but I know you can do it. You just need to push yourself. Huh! [grunts] Like so. Now you try. [grunting] [gasps] [gasps] I've got it! I've got it! [Floop shouting] [crashing] [Davebot] Not Zen. Not Zen. Bleep, blarp. -A little help? -[Davebot] Hmm? How did arm get back there? [Carmen] Scorp, come in. We need you. We got something. Over! [Floop grunting] Oh, go on. I'll be fine. [Scorpion] David Robot, unstick Father. -[Davebot] Unstick. Unstick. -[Floop yelps] All right, Agent No-One! We finally-- huh? [Ace] Gone? Guh! Whacked by mole, again. This can't be right. Gablet and I totes tracked the signal here. Yeah. No duh. -[sighs] Frustrated emoji. -Hmm. It would appear we're still one step behind this fiend. Yeah, but we have No-One on the run. The mole's getting sloppy. -They'll make a mistake and then-- -Mission Critical will be there! Carm, we should get back. Who knows if this was just another one of No-One's distractions. Mission Critical, to the library! [sighs] [Juni] So... you and your dad have been doing yoga the last few weeks? Yes. It has been good for our relationship. But I do not think it has been great for his bones. Creak like old shutters. Maybe me and my dad could use a little yoga. What's been going on with you lately? Ever since you came back from your little side mission, you've been acting-- Uh, me? Nothing. I'm fine. I wish No-One was a real mole. Back in Australia, we would've just lured the little beastie right into a bucket. Put a few flies in there, they jumped right in. Captured! Flies? Jump right in? I don't think you know what a mole is, Ace-mate. [laughs] Sure, I do. Long legs, green. Goes "ribbit-ribbit." A mole. Uh, that's a frog. No, it ain't. Not in Australia. Wait, that's it. Really? Well, we're going to need a very large bucket. -I will find one. -I will help. Not a bucket. Of course. More like a garbage can. No. What we need to do is lure No-One into our very own bucket. [crickets chirping] We set a trap. Right. I can get PSI to whip up a traceable isotope so, when No-One enters our dorm rooms to try and swipe the serum... We'll totes be able to track them! We catch mole with hands reddened. Yes, not a bad plan. Better than a large bucket, I might add. -But it is missing one crucial element. -What? A diversion. We will need an academy-wide diversion to give No-One an opportunity to mole about. Crikey. How do we expect to distract an entire academy? [Juni] Ha! Leave that to me. [Murna] Attention, cadets! ♪ Doo do-do do-do-do-do! ♪ This is Murna, your Academy Information Officer, with Breaking Murna news. ♪ Doo do-do do-do-do-do do do! ♪ There will be an emergency briefing from Mission Critical in the main hall, and attendance is mandatory. [chatter] Mission Critical, keep tabs on who's here and who's not. Seems like everyone's here. Well, Gablet will alert us when the mole trips the trap. Then, hashtag, got 'em! Tango, who is going to do briefing? You were supposed to figure out that part. [slurping] -Oh, no, no, no, no! -You'll be fine. You're a natural. [yelps] [nervous laugh] [whimpering] -Uh... hello. -[feedback rings] As some of you know, I am Awesome. Uh, Sir Awesome... And, uh, well, I'll be the one... um... briefing you today. [whimpers] -[boy 1] What? What is this? -[all groan] -[boy 2] Seriously? -[girl] Come on, dude. -[groaning continues] -[coughs] Spy Academy cadets! [shouts] Faculty. Clemp. We at Mission Critical have a dangerous situation on our hands that only you can help solve. -Where is he going with this? -Shh. SWAMP has performed their most fiendishly diabolical plot yet. -Uh... -Huh? They have stolen, uh... the entire western hemisphere's supply of tea! [gasps] Oh, my! Ah! -[yowls] -Ah! That's right! This mission will test the very limits of your training. It will require stealth, strength and a working knowledge of the regulations, history and etiquette of tea drinking. Which we will be examining for the next nine hours. -Seriously? -You kidding? First, the proper pinky angle for sipping... -[alarm beeps] -[Gablet] Uh, guys, the trap has sprung! The trap has sprung! Uh, now keep your pinkies up and your heads in the clouds. Ta-ta! Mission Critical, we need to talk! -[spurts, screeches] -[gasps] [Gablet] South corridor! West corridor! Down the hall to the right! -[Carmen grunts] -[Glitch grunts] -No-One is in the armory. -Yes! We finally have you, mole. Hopefully, he won't hop away like a real mole. -Ugh. -[Carmen] Shh! Get ready. [all] Huh? -No way! -It cannot be. -Floop is the mole? -Father is mole? [Glitch] OMG. What do we do? We grab Floop and we take him to Vida? No. We do no such thing. I... I think we have to, Scorpion. -He's the mole. The isotope proves it. -[growling] -He was looking for the serum. -Hmm? [growling] [bracelets buzzing] [Globinator powers up] Wait, wait, wait! There's no way Floop has flipped. He checked out when we screened the faculty. But he is the master of media manipulation, Aztec. It's totes possible he tricked us. Remember what Dad said, Juni. No, I trust Floop. He'd never betray us. There must be some other explanation for this. Right? Allow me until morning to prove he is not mole. And I'll help. -Juni-- -Come on, Carm. Floop at least deserves that to prove this is all some sort of mix-up, doesn't he? And if we cannot prove it, we will go to Vida. Together. Deal? Okay. You have until morning. -[Floop] Ah! -Father. Ooh! Ooh! It's my two favorite people. And what do I owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit? Why were you not at mandatory briefing earlier? [stammering] Oh, um, well, you know, I was just, uh, trying to, uh... I'm surprised you even noticed I wasn't there. Yeah, it's kinda weird you weren't there when everyone else was. Well, I was, uh-- You know, I was, uh-- -Just say it. -[whimpers] Okay! [sighs] I was with Davebot. -[gasps] -What? David Robot? He was helping me with the Upward Spastic Spider Monkey pose. Oh, I wanted to get it right so I could surprise you, Scorpy. I know how much it would mean to you if I could master it. [grunts] But I threw my back out. So I went to find some ointment to loosen my muscles. In our dorm rooms? What? But I was nowhere near your dorm rooms. Then how do explain the tracking isotope on your shoes? Tracking isotope? [beeping] Huh? I trusted you, Father. But now, I see I was wrong. Scorpy, I don't know what this is about! I was with Davebot. I promise. I would never lie to you. [growls] If he's telling the truth, Scorp, all we need to do is get the time-stamped footage from Davebot's memory. It's simple. Hmm. Fine. [grunts] Really sorry, June. Davebot just had his weekly upgrade, which dumps all old memory. You just missed it. [Scorpion growls] Hey, we'll figure something out. We still have time. I know. It is just that the last few weeks have been some of the best of my life. Finally, I was starting to feel like I had a family. A father. I have learned that you must accept people for who and what they are. Father is not perfect, but I believed he was trying. I could not live with idea that all of this was just lie. It's not like I have backup father. He is all I have. Wait, backup! That's it! P, aren't all of Davebot's memory cards backed up on the main server in case of accidental deletions? Uh, yes. Yes, they are. In the main server room on the lower level. Boom! Scorp, all we need to do is get the hard drive from the server room before it's deleted. But how long until that happens? Uh, not sure, but it can't be long. Then we must hurry! This is the most secure place in the entire academy. And that's where Davebot's memory is housed. Strongest lasers in the world. Can cut through solid steel like a hot knife through butter. So, how do we get hard drive? Looks like a two-person job. One to turn off the lasers and one to grab the hard drive. Someone has to stand on the pressure plate while the other makes a mad dash to the hard drive. It's tricky. We'll only have seconds. So, are you ready, then? Yeah, but I should probably grab my Bounder Boots first. -That'll get us in and out quicker. -Good idea. Now, where did I put those Bounder Boots? I had them on our last mission and... Huh. Wait a-- -[shatters] -[gasps] -[beeping] -A camera? Oh, no. Floop's the mole. -[gasps] Hmph. -Whoa! -Oh, no! -What? Another tracking device. Juni, I don't know how those got in there, honest. You brought all this stuff from your warehouse, that's how. But anyone could have planted those. It proves nothing. I found this in our room. It's a voice-activated recorder to catch any inadvertent sleep-talking. Where was it? No. Not Ellie. We have no choice. We have to tell Vida about this. I'm sorry, Scorpion. I didn't want to believe it either, but-- Oh, I'm innocent! You have to believe me. I've been framed. I would never do this. The Academy is my second chance at everything. I would never jeopardize that. Scorpy? Hmm. Fetch Vida. I will stand guard and make sure he doesn't pull any more of his tricks. -[door opens] -[nervous laugh] Bambini, what is going on? First, you stage a phony mission briefing about stolen tea, and now this. By the way, Ms. Chatting-Botham is still in shock over the tea thing. Um, yes, sorry about that. I'll send her some apology biscuits. [chuckles] You better. And this better be important. I was making birthday plans. Uh, and what birthday would that be? Shh, Juni! Trust us, Headmaster Immortata, it's very important. We have vital intel that impacts the academy and the entire OSS right in here. Huh? Uh... -Huh? What's going on? -Uh... We're too early. It's still downloading. Yep. You know Mission Critical, always two steps ahead. [nervous laugh] So, give us a few minutes and we'll come grab you soon, 'kay? [angry grunt, muttering] We've gotta stop Scorpion before she does something crazy. Carm, this is Scorpion we're talking about. Everything she does is crazy. [Floop grunting] Scorpy, stop! What are you doing? Getting you out of here. What? Why? You will need to go into deep cover. Drop off grid. I suggest mountains. I can't live in the mountains! You know how I am with altitudes. Remember the nosebleeds? -It is only way to elude capture. -No. Stop! -I'm staying right here. -But you will be imprisoned. Listen, Scorpy. Claudia. I'm innocent. But I'm not gonna run and hide and let my daughter take the fall for me. I'd happily rot in an OSS prison for a crime I didn't commit if that means you stay on Mission Critical. So, I'm gonna sit here and wait for Mission Critical and Vida Immortata to come get me. I'll tell them I tried to escape and you captured me. Ha. You just passed test. Test? What test? Now I know for sure you are not mole. Mole would never be so selfless. Well, well. Looks like we have another performer in the family. I learned from best. Now come, Father, we must clear your name. -And we don't have a lot of time. -Ah! Scorpion, stop! -OMG. We're too late. -[Gablet] Uh, not really. They're totally not heading for the exits, you guys. Not like the press did at Karina Danielle's last fashion show. Have you seen her spring line? Yuck! Gablet's right. -About the spring line? -Yes. But, no. They're not headed up. They're headed down. Carm, I know where she's going. That is where David Robot's memory is stored. We must act quickly. Mission Critical spotted us. But how do we get it? It will take both of us. You stand on pressure plate to shut off laser and I will go after hard drive. [beeping] [buzzes] The lasers aren't shutting off. I must be too heavy. Okay, I will stand on pressure plate, but you must go after hard drive. Scorpy, this isn't-- Hard drive is key to your innocence. -But-- -You are only father I have. And I am not willing to lose you again. We must do this, together. [bones cracking] Let's do this! Good. Oh, and we must get hard drive before clock hits zero or it will be magnetically wiped. What was that, now? -Now! Go! -[beeps] [Carmen] Scorpion! Stop! [timer beeping] -No! Father! -Got it! Uh-oh, no one told me that would happen. Step on it again. [buzzer buzzes] It's detected an intruder. It's on full security mode now! Ah! I'm trapped! We have to take out those laser cannons. There's way too many of them. There's nothing he can do. Yes, there is. Yoga. But I'm no good at it, Scorpy. I'll just get stuck again! No, you can do this. I believe in you. [exhales] [grunting] Father, use the Upward Spastic Spider Monkey to get through the laser grid! -[grunts] -[bones cracking] I did it! ♪ I did it! ♪ [kids sigh] -Oh! -I knew you could. Well, I did learn from the best. Now, the proof we needed. [beeps] [yelling on loop] The time stamp proves it. Floop was with Davebot during the briefing. But all the spy devices in the Floop products, the isotope. -All planted by your mole. -[yelling loop continues] -You can turn that off. -[beeps] Of course. Agent No-One knew we needed two people to get the proof. ♪ Exactly! ♪ But No-One never counted on those two being the two of us. Oh! Hashtag, heart melt. -This calls for a selfie. -[camera shutter clicks] Sorry for doubting you. Me, too, Professor Floop. Oh, you were just doing what any of us would have done with that evidence. Truth is, without being falsely accused, I never would have truly bonded with my sweet Scorpy here. Oh, about "Scorpy" pet name. I do not love it. [Golden Brain] Therese, what is the meaning of this? You know how much I hate surprises. I do, but you won't hate this one, Mr. Brain. Just keep your eyes closed. Okay, now open them! [nervous laugh] [all laughing] [Golden Brain] Oh, send everyone away! I am in no mood for carnivals! Oh, I don't think you'll wanna do that when you look at this, Mr. Brain. [Golden Brain] What? [stammering] Therese... -There must be enough money here to-- -[Therese] Yep! To build your Isochamber, Mr. Brain. Now you'll never have another sleepless night because of that dolphin net injury of yours. [Golden Brain laughing] Therese, I will never forget this. My pleasure, Mr. Brain. Now, don't we have an Isochamber to build? [Golden Brain] Yes, we do.
