 Where are they? [Tom humming] -Ugh! Will you hurry up already? -[all shout] [Awesome grunts] Uh, her superstitions are totes getting worse, Aztec. -[both] Ah! -[Carmen] Superstition? -[scoffs] That's ridiculous! -[Tom humming] [Carmen] It's just some pre-mission prep. What's so weird about that? Since we've been on this streak, I've been eating the same pre-mission meal, brushing my teeth left to right,

 avoiding stepping on any cracks, and, as always, wearing my lucky socks. -Yes, not weird at all. -Hmm. But, Carm, Vida's intercepted intelligence said Golden Brain is planning a break-in to steal some chemical data. If we hurry, we can nab it before he does. Maybe you should just-- Juni, 11 consecutive successful missions. Why change the routine now? We're on a roll. -Ugh! -Plus, I've planned this operation -down to every detail. -[toy squeaking] Now, where are those socks? [Tom grunting] Not now, Tom. No interruptions. [Tom groans] Come on, Tango, snap to it.

 -Huh. -[Carmen] Aha! Here they are. Now we're ready. [all groan] [chuckles] [Awesome grunts] [weapon powers up, zaps] Ha ha! Well, that was a snap, Junior. I knew it! You can't snap! Ha! Of course I can, mate. My hands are just greasy from the rope. -Shh! -[boys] Hmm? The server room looks like it's down that way. Aztec, scout ahead for any signs of SWAMP. -[boots power up] -[grunts] All clear, Tango. What were you guys rushing me for? Looks like we got the drop on them. -Voice activation panel. Sir Awesome? -[electronic chirping] [clears throat] [speaking Awesomese] [beeping rapidly] What did you say to it? [chuckles] That, my dear, is between me and the keypad. Scorpion? [grunting] -[Carmen] Glitch? -Hmm. Gablet, download all files. Sure. But first, do you wanna hear the hot goss from the set of Sting Ryker's newest movie? [gasps] OMG! What happened? [Carmen clears her throat] Tell me everything later. Hashtag, can't wait. Most def. [both] Huh? -It is freight elevator. -SWAMP! You and your lucky socks! No worries. Don't stop the download. I'll cut the power to slow them up. -But, Carm-- -[whistles] [whimpering] Uh... [whimpering] [sighs] Huh? Uh-oh. It's speeding up. -[beeps] -Done! -[giggles] -Great. Carm, let's get-- [dings] [Swampies] Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. [Swampies growling] -[zaps] -[Swampies] Huh? [all grunting] [boots power up] [Swampies] Hut, hut, hut. Gablet, boomerang mode! [Swampies groan] [Gablet] Nighty night, losers. What'd I do? [Juni] Come on, Carm, before more show up! [Swampies groan] Looks like a formula for some sort of super fuel. Good thing Golden Brain didn't get his hands on that. Looks pretty nasty. Nice work, Mission Critical! Another successful mission! -Yes! -[kids cheering] [Glitch] Awesome! [Carmen sighs] Twelve in a row. [meek laugh] -I choked out there, Juni. -Well, hey, we're a team. A team watches each other's backs and picks up the slack if someone stumbles. So you think I messed up, too. Well, uh... I don't understand it. I did everything just like always. But I was all thumbs when it came to those wires. The mission was still a success. We got the data file. Yeah, but we almost didn't because of me. Hey, why don't we all--? No, thanks. I think I need to be alone for a little while. -Oh! -[Tom grunting] -[growls] -[Tom grunts] What's wrong with Tango? Oh, her? Nothing. Let's go grab some burritos. I heard they have a new one wrapped in a pancake. Ooh, hashtag, everything's better wrapped in a pancake. Truer words were never hashtagged. [Swampies yelling] [Golden Brain] I should feed you all to the sharkodiles for this failure! As you might have noticed, this news has made me a little upset. Obtaining that formula is crucial to my overall plans, Lieutenant. I cannot make my next moves without it. Understood, sir. -And we are sincerely-- -[Therese] Mr. Brain! [Golden Brain] Ah! Shh! Everyone quiet. It's Therese! Act natural. Like we were in the middle of a board meeting or something and not like I was just threatening your lives. -Quick, here she comes! -[all shout] [Golden Brain] Blah, blah, quarterly reports. -Fiscal year. Oh, yes. -Federally mandated sick days. [Golden Brain] Yes, eternity leave. Ah, Therese, welcome. Just finishing up with the boys from the board. You know, boring corporate things and such. -Yeah! -[Swampies giggle] Well, I don't wanna interrupt. I just wanted to inform you that the new project is going just peachy. Any luck with the fuel formula? [Golden Brain] Oh, yes. We will have it for you in a jiffy. Oh! Isn't he just the greatest boss? -[laughing awkwardly] -[Lieutenant] Yeah. Yeah. [Golden Brain] Ahem! [grunting] [sharkodiles hiss and chomp] -Oh, yeah. He's the best! -Like a second father to me! Then let me get back to work. -Ooh! -[Golden Brain] Huh? [sighs] She's killing me. Lieutenant, we move to plan B. Agent No-One is getting close to accomplishing the mission. I need that formula! -Carm, how are you...? -Let's roll, Juni. I'm ready to go. [whistles] [all grunt] Okay, Mission Critical, let's practice covering our escape. Carmen, catch! Ooh! -Carm! -[Carmen grunts] OMG. What happened? [Juni grunts] As you know, this is Class Presentation Week. And the first student to present will be... Cadet Tina is not here. Then... -Cadet Cortez! -[Carmen] Huh? [gasps] -Dismantle and reassemble. Schnell! -[gasps] Uh? [ticking rapidly] [whimpers] [beeping] Uh... [grunting] -[electricity crackles] -Ugh! [laughing] [beeping and ticking continue] [rapid beeping] -Oh, nein! -[all shouting] [robot] Terminate. Terminate. -[shouting continues] -[robot] Terminate. Attention, cadets, this is Murna, your academy information officer, with today's announcements. -The Code Breakers Club... -Whew! ...has this message for its members on the location change. The moose is by the window. The blue banana is green. -[both grunt] -That is all. [both groan] [both grunting] -Uh, I didn't know you-- -[Tom grunts] [chuckles] [Tom] Hmm? [sighs] [cadet] Hey, who's throwing milk? Oh, no. I'm Tom Thumb-Thumb. [Tom] Hmm? [Juni] Okay, what's so secret that you needed to talk to me here? Is this about your crush on Ace? 'Cause we all already know-- No. Juni, I'm cursed. [dramatic music plays] -Uh, you're what, now? -Cursed! Somehow I jinxed myself, and now I'm all thumbs. Whoa! [grunts] [sighs] See what I mean? Carm, I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for why this is happening, and-- Yes. During my pre-mission prepping, I yelled at Tom Thumb-Thumb. And now, it's as if I've been jinxed to be taught some kind of lesson. [dramatic music plays] Okay, yeah. Not quite the logical explanation I was looking for, but... -[Vida, shouting] Carmen! Juni! -Huh? Vida. Oh, thank goodness I found you. I didn't think you would hear me. I was using my quiet voice. Headmaster Immortata, what's wrong? Our scanners intercepted more SWAMP chatter. They're after another source of that fuel formula, so we need you to get it before they do. No worries, Headmaster. You can count on Mission Critical. Eccellente, bambini. Grazie. [whistles] Hey, you! No shouting in the halls! I guess we need to get to work planning this new mission. -I can't do that. -What do you mean? It's mission number 13. [dramatic music plays] Come on, Carmen, this is all in your head. You had a bad mission. It happens to all of us. No, it's the jinx. I have to break it or I'll be all thumbs forever. Carm, you're not jinxed. -Oh! [growls] -Huh. -Really? -Well, how do you plan to break it? I'm not completely sure, but I think I might have an idea. -[Carmen] PSI! -Huh? -I need your help. -[Tom grunting] Uh, Carmen, aren't you supposed to be planning a mission right now? Long story. I've got a new mission. Operation: Broken Thumb. You're gonna help me fix Tom Thumb-Thumb for good. [Tom] Hmm? Another copy of the fuel formula is being held at the company's backup server facility 30 miles from the first location. According to our intercepted intelligence, that's where Golden Brain is gonna strike. Gablet, bring up a map of the location. [Gablet] Hey, look, G, it's the same as the last place with some slight variations. Speaking of same, did you know Emily Madison and Corinne Francais wore the same dress to the premiere of Zombie Heart last night? -Super cute. -Ugh! We don't have time for this now. Ugh! Whatevs. We'll talk later! Totes. BT dubs, Aztec, where's Tango? Yes, I have not seen her since she nearly blew up classroom. And teacher. Uh, she'll be here. She's just taking care of some other stuff first. But she's the one that usually plans all these missions. Right, and she will. But we need to get a jump on it. Time is of the essence. Okay, PSI, we're gonna help me-- I mean, Tom, not to be all thumbs anymore. Uh, Carmen, in case you haven't noticed, he's nothing but-- I know, but we need to help him anyway. It's very important. -Why? -Just trust me, it is. [grunting] [sighs] -First, we'll work on balance. -[both] Huh? Maybe Tom's walk is causing his clumsiness. Uh-uh. Those are my new experimental gyroscopic balance boards. I still need to calibrate them. They are really sensitive. Come on, how sensitive could they be? -[boards power up] -[Tom] Hmm? -[Tom grunts] -[Carmen laughs] What were you worried about? Okay, Tom, prepare to be light on your feet. [Tom screams] -[crashes] -[both grunt] Oh, no! My muskrat musk extract! That took weeks to harvest! -[Tom screams] -[crashes] My never-nap ray! I've been up for days working on that! [crashes] My Abraham Lincoln made out of pasta for history class! The hat alone took nine hours! Well, how do you stop it? [thuds] Okay, so they're a little sensitive. [Tom groans] So, Aztec, are you absolutely certain we should enter through the incinerator? No, of course we shouldn't. Just testing you. Good job, team! -[all groan] -[laughs] Could you excuse me for a moment? -Tango. Come in, Tango. This is Aztec. -[Carmen] Hey, Juni, what's--? [thuds] -Did you just drop your comm? -No. -Yes. -Guess the jinx isn't gone. I'm still working on it. How's the mission planning going? I can't tell an incinerator from an elevator. You need to hurry up. We got foot coordination down. Now we're moving onto hand coordination. -Hopefully, that should lift the jinx. -It better. We're running out of time. Aztec out. [upbeat music playing] [no audible dialogue] [rattles] [thuds] Ugh! When is Tango coming back? She can plan this stuff like that. -Uh-- -This map has so many marks on it. Confused emoji. [Scorpion] Is that tic-tac-toe game? [door opens] Mission Critical, why are you still here? We received word that SWAMP is already on the move. Andiamo! And where's Carmen? No worries, Headmaster. We were just gearing up. -Good. I knew I could count on you. -[door opens] [Juni] Our mission window is closing fast. I hate to say this, but we're gonna have to leave without Carmen or risk SWAMP nabbing that data. [all] Hmm. [groans] [Tom humming] Boom! Looking good, Carmen. [laughs sheepishly, growls] The jinx, it's still there. But I fixed him just like it wanted. [Tom grunting] That's it! The last piece! If I'm really gonna fix you, I'm gonna need to get you to talk. I was working on this universal translator prototype for international missions. -[Carmen] Tom, can you speak? -[Tom] Hello, Carmen. It works! Tom, you're finally perfect! You're no longer all thumbs. [Tom sighs] -[door closes] -What's the matter? Thank you for your help, Carmen, but I was fine with the way I was. But now you're all fixed. Look at you. You have balance, dexterity, and a beautiful speaking voice. [Tom] Yes, quite. I admit there were a lot of things I couldn't do before all this, but I have chosen long ago not to dwell on those things. I don't understand. [Tom] Ah, Carmen. Life is about celebrating your wins and learning from your losses, not dwelling on them, like you have been doing since the last mission. Wait. It wasn't you that needed fixing. It was me. There wasn't a jinx. It was just me dwelling on a mistake and not accepting it for what it was, a mistake. [Tom] Everyone makes mistakes. But it is not the mistake that defines you, but how you deal with it. Then I got into my own head and kept the jinx going. [Tom] Elementary, my dear Tango. Elementary. -Ooh! -I'm sorry I tried to fix you, Tom. You're perfect just as you are. Now, let's go find the team. Oh, no. They went on the mission without me? [Tom] But maybe there's still time to catch them? Huh? Swampies! Oh, no. If I hadn't spent so much time worrying about that silly jinx and had just listened to Juni, this never would have happened! I've gotta go. [grunts] [groans] Change of plans! Did we have a plan to start with? Someone get the data before these goons do. Tango would definitely have a better plan than that. -[Swampie growls] -[yelps] -Hey, trying my best. -[Swampie growling] -[grunts] -Maybe we should head for incinerator. There's no place for sarcasm at a time like this. [electricity zaps] [Swampies grunt] OMG! SWAMP just downloaded the data. What should we do? [evil laugh] [Carmen] Let's see. [beeping] Juni, use your boots and attack the flank from above. Sir Awesome and Scorpion, come at them from both sides. Glitch, short out their comms so they can't call for backup. Ace, lay down covering fire. -Yah! -Yah! I'm so glad you're here. We were really blowing it. No time to focus on the negative. Let's focus on what we do well. -Ow! -Kicking SWAMP butt! [Swampie] Hut, hut, hut! [Swampie groans] -Huh? -[Swampies groaning] [all growl] [all groan] [Glitch] Ha ha! [Juni grunts] [Carmen gasps] -[grunts] -[groans] [grunts] Uh-oh. [Swampie] Bye-bye, Spy Kids. -[beeps] -[male voice] Elevator going down. There's no such thing as jinxes. It's just in your head, Carmen. [sighs] -[grunts] -[gears whir] [male voice] Level 30. Evil data storage. Okay, Mission Critical, let's cover our exit. Juni, smoke bomb me! [Swampie] Where'd they go? Here's to lucky number 13! [slurps] [all cheering] Thirteen! Hey, sorry, guys, for totally messing up our mission plan and for also missing that tackle. Hey, we're a team, and teammates are always there to pick up the slack for each other. Someone kinda smart told me that once. You calling me smart? I said "kinda smart." Don't push it. [Tom humming] [groans] -I thought you said you fixed him. -Nah, he actually fixed me. [Tom humming] -[Golden Brain shouts] -[Swampies whimpering] -[Golden Brain shouts] -Ho! [Golden Brain] Once Agent No-One steals the serum from those spy brats, I will have no way to use it without the Isochamber. And I cannot power the Isochamber without the formula. -With no formula, my plan is ruined. -[Swampies gasp] [Golden Brain] Ruined! Uh... Mr. Brain? [Golden Brain] Oh, uh, Therese. How-- How much did you hear? I heard it all, Mr. Brain, and it was very disturbing. [Golden Brain] Okay, Therese, let me explain. I'm very disappointed, Mr. Brain. [Golden Brain] I know, and... But you shouldn't be because I had a backup plan all along! [laughing] [Golden Brain] Wait, so you didn't hear the--? I designed another power generator that runs on crystals and precious metals. Completely eco-friendly. Oh, I'm sorry I didn't run it by you first, Mr. Brain. Are you angry with me? [Golden Brain] Angry? No! Quite the contrary, Therese! I'm elated! Brilliant idea! In fact, I believe a promotion is in order. Effective immediately, you will be getting a desk to go with your chair. [squeals] Thank you, Mr. Brain! -Oh, I told you he's the greatest boss! -[Swampie] What? [Golden Brain coughs] Sharkodiles. -Oh, yeah. So smart, so handsome. -What a kind and gentle soul. Now, look at the new designs, Mr. Brain. I really hope that this Isochamber will help with that shoulder injury you got while saving those dolphins. [Swampie] Shoulder injury? Dolphin? What? [Golden Brain] I'm sure it will help me just fine, Therese. Just fine. [laughing evilly] [Therese joining in laughter] [Golden Brain] Just fine! [laughs]
