 [rocket roaring] Huh? [wind whistling] Why would someone want to meet way out here in the middle of nowhere to look at my sketches? Hmm. These were the coordinates in the email. Weird. [Golden Brain] Ah, so glad you could make it, Peter St. Ignatius. Or may I call you PSI? Golden Brain.

 Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no! [whimpers] [Golden Brain] Please do not mistake my intent, PSI. I have no reason to harm you. I actually think we might be able to help each other. -Mm, help each other? -[Golden Brain] Yes. Call it a gentlemen's agreement. Ha! I'd never help you. So whatever deal you have, I'm not interested. Boom! [Golden Brain] Oh... not even if it meant finding your parents? [gasps] My parents? But how could you--? [Golden Brain] Did you forget that as a former operative of the OSS, I know all of its secrets?

 Including all of its most highly classified information, such as agent files? Missing agent files. But first, I'll need something from you, PSI. The Spy Kids have something of mine, a vial of specialized fuel serum. Without it, I cannot power my cyber-body. So, get me the serum, and I will tell you where your parents are. It's very simple. No need to answer now. My direct line. A meaningless vial of cyber-fuel for the chance to see your family again? [chuckles] Seems like a no-brainer to me. Huh? [Gregorio] To the Taco Butte! It is his only way out. [Ingrid] We'll do a full sweep of the area. He can't be far. I can't believe the person we were searching for this whole time was PSI. I know he'll realize his mistake and come back, Carm. How can you be so sure? He was the mole. He was Agent No-One. He double-crossed us, Juni! He was fooled! He didn't know what the Pinnoquinox was capable of doing. That's the only explanation. He would never hurt us on purpose. -[elevator dings] -[Juni and Carmen] Uh? Oh, hello, Mission Critical. Looking for something? -Or maybe someone? -[boys laughing] Ugh, really? Like we need this now? We're sorry. Is this a bad time? Not that we actually care. [giggles] You've been acting very suspicious lately. We think you're keeping a secret from everyone. No secret. We don't like you guys. Yeah, we're definitely not hiding that. Now, if you wouldn't mind, we're going to have some taco-changas. No matter. We'll find out sooner or later. Because you're getting sloppy, Cortezes. -And when we do find out your secret... -We're going straight to Vida with it. [twins] Then bye-bye, Mission Critical! -[twins] Rock and roll! -[B-Team laughing] I really dislike those kids. I blame their parents. -[Glitch] Aztec! Tango! -Huh? We searched the entire Academy, top to bottom. Every room, secret or otherwise. -And? -Zip, zero, zilch. Gablet even did an inventory of all the jetpacks. One was taken from the training room about two hours ago. [sighs] Frowny face emoji. I'm sorry to have to report this, but... PSI and the Pinnoquinox are long gone. [sighs] [both] Maybe we can... No. [both] Or maybe we should... That would not work. [both] Or then there's... [both groan] -Okay. That was spooky. -Mm-hmm. PSI! Come in, PSI! It's Juni! PSI, if you can hear me, come back! -[static crackling] -[groans] P, it's not too late. [sighs] I just won't believe he flipped sides on us, Mom. He would never do that. He just made a mistake. We should tell Vida about all of this. We'd also have to explain why we didn't tell her about the mole or the Pinnoquinox. [Glitch whimpers] So, what is plan? We storm SWAMP HQ and take the serum back by force. It's risky, but what choice do we have? We have been in deep cover too long. We could use a night on the town. Well, no one ever said we were not cuckoo-bananas. Okay, Mission Critical, let's go get our serum back! And save the world while we're at it. [Gablet] Uh, you guys? Incoming! -What's that? -Is it a bird? Is it plane? -Oh, no! Is it a bird plane? -Hmm? Huh? Mission Critical, prepare for impact! -[all grunting] -[weapons powering up] [slurps, grunts] [Carmen] PSI? [all] Huh? Whew! I'm just glad it wasn't a bird plane. [girls grunt] I've come to apologize for making a mess of things. And also to warn you. Golden Brain has the serum and he knows how to use it. [all] Huh? So, he shows up just as we happen to be leaving to stop Golden Brain? Coincidence? I am thinking no. Come on, you guys. He risked his life to escape SWAMP HQ and bring us this information. But you have to admit it all does seem a little bit coincidental, Juni. -The way he showed up out of nowhere? -[both] Mm-hmm. He sacrificed finding out where his parents are just so he could warn us. What else does he need to do to prove that he's sorry? [Ace and Scorpion] Hmm. -Oh, this is no good. -[gasps] It's powered by precious metals, crystals, and solar panels. An eco-friendly doomsday machine. -Quite progressive, actually. -[others] Huh? Because of this, it also needs time to power up. -How much time? -Roughly four hours. That's enough time for us to get in and out of SWAMP HQ. [Gablet] Actually, calculating the time that has already passed, that would put the countdown to Golden Brain taking the Pinnoquinox at... -[beeping] -[gasps] [both gasp] [Golden Brain groans] Uh-huh. Hmm? Aha! [panting] [grunts] [beeps] Oh, Therese, is there any way we could possibly speed this up? I do have quite a few things I need to take care of this afternoon. Oh, buck up, Mr. Brain. It's like my mother always says, "A watched pot never boils." -[Golden Brain] Huh? -♪ ...jolly good fellow ♪ [Golden Brain] Still warming up. [Swampies muttering lyrics] Oh, Mr. Brain, is it your birthday? "Congrats on your world domination." Hmm? [Swampies] Uh... -Oh, Mr. Brain, this is horrible! -[Golden Brain groans] Well, Therese, you were bound to find out sooner or later, and-- I didn't even get you a gift. [Golden Brain] Say what? A birthday gift! Why didn't you tell me? -[Golden Brain] But the cake said-- -[laughs] Yeah! -That was a good one. -[Swampies] Huh? While this puppy is warming up, I'm gonna run out and get you something. I hate to be at a party empty-handed. [humming] [Golden Brain] No need-- I don't need-- [sighs] [Swampies] ♪ For he's a jolly good... ♪ [Carmen] With the Isochamber now in play, our odds of a successful mission have decreased significantly. OMG! Exactly! I'm trying to come up with another plan, Glitch. No, no, no. I meant "OMG." -Mm-hmm. -Like "OMG!" I have no idea what she's saying. But I do. She's onto something. What you got, Glitch? I've been studying the Pinnoquinox's chemical properties, and I think I might have found something. The Seanlukas Whelanus. The mushroom's extract is a 99-percent natural match for an anti-serum. Brilliant! Now all we need to do is locate one, get the extract, and swap it out for the real serum before Golden Brain takes it. It looks like, according to my Gablapedia, they grow in a mountain range north of us. -Holler! -Okay, Carm... me, Mom, Ace, Scorpion, and PSI will keep an eye on Golden Brain while you go after the anti-serum. -[grunts] -[Ace and Scorpion] Huh? Hmm. Okay, gear up! We're going on a mushroom hunt. [eagle screeching] [all panting] Huh? [Carmen] Uh, where are they? -IDK. This is where Gablet identified. -[beeps] Look! Tango, up ahead! Hmm. [all panting] [gasps] [Carmen] The Seanlukas Whelanus. We found it! -[beeps] -Juni, we've located the mushroom. [Juni] Way to go, Carm! We're just coming up on SWAMP HQ. Looks normal from here. Good. Keep me posted. All right. One anti-serum coming up. Okay, we'll enter through the landing bay and infiltrate the base like last time. Actually, I know a safer way. A secret entrance. -Huh? -What? [Ace and Scorpion] Hmm. Okay, lead the way. [Scorpion growls] I have a bad feeling about this. The Seanlukas Whelanus. Hey! [screeches] -[eagle screeches] -[growls] -[screeches] -What the--? -Uh, Tango? -[eagles screeching] It would appear we have interrupted dinnertime. Ah! They're protecting their feeding ground. Quick, we need to get a mushroom before they do! [grunts] [Carmen sighs] They're all gone. Ooh! [gasps] The Seanlukas Whelanus. -Tango, I found one! -Huh? Awesome! No, don't! -[eagle screeching] -[whimpering] Huh? [laughs] There has to be more around here, no? Gablet, run a quick botanical scan of the area. Just like the reviews of Finn Ryker's new movie, G. Negative. [Golden Brain groaning] Charge. Charge. Charge. Will you just charge, already? This is taking forever! All I want to do is take over the world! -Is that too much to ask? -[door opens] -Security has been breached! -[Golden Brain cringes] What?! [grunts] -[growls] -[computer beeps] [Golden Brain] Oh! No. I will not tolerate party crashers today, Lieutenant! [Lieutenant] But the chamber isn't fully charged. [Golden Brain] I know that, but 70 percent is still better than nothing! When I give the word, push the button. Now, Lieutenant, now! [beeps] [gas hissing] Uh, sir? [Golden Brain laughing maniacally] Oh, frustrated emoji! The closest location for another mushroom patch is a three-hour flight from here. But we don't have that kind of time. [Gablet] Uh, you guys? I got something! I've located a Seanlukas Whelanus in the area. -Where?! -Uh, weird... but my scanners say... -it's circling directly above us? -Huh? [Carmen] The eagle. It hasn't eaten it! Okay, let's grab our jetpacks and chase her down. No, too risky. That mushroom is our only shot. -Hmm. -[monocle powers up] It looks like she's heading for her nest. That's it! If we can hide in that nest, then we can grab the mushroom. But I am too big. -Yeah, me, too. -Hashtag, samesies. Actually, I would fit just right. [slurping] Hmm? [all] Hmm. Oh, dear. -Ah! Excuse you! -[chirping] This is a very delicate piece of spy equipment. [yelps] Not to mention I just had it pressed. -[eagle screeching] -Ah! [chicks chirping] -[screeches] -[Awesome gasps] [chicks chirping] [Awesome chirping] Aha! [gulps] Well, it looks like it's time to leave the nest. Heh-heh! [eagle screeches] [Awesome panting] [whimpering] -Ya! -Got it! -[screeching] -Ha! [Awesome panting] Huh? [screeches] Great work, Awesome. Next stop, SWAMP HQ! -[eagle screeches] -Ah! -[Golden Brain laughing maniacally] -[rumbling] -Ace, please tell me that was stomach. -I wish, mate. He's taken the serum. What do you mean? It's not time yet. Unless Agent No-One set us up again. -I knew it. -Look! -[gasps] -[Golden Brain laughing maniacally] Uh, Juni, under the circumstances, I think we should probably-- -Run! -[all panting] P! What are you doing? Hmm. [gasps] -[Golden Brain laughing maniacally] -[whimpers] [Carmen] Juni, what's going on? Golden Brain used the Pinnoquinox. -OMG! -[gasping] Did you get the anti-serum? Where's PSI? [Scorpion and Juni growling] [male voice] The Isochamber is fully operational. I repeat, the Isochamber is fully operational. Quick, Carm, throw me the serum! -[Golden Brain laughing maniacally] -[grunting] [Golden Brain] Oh, I do love surprises. Don't you? Juni, now! -[grunting] -Not so fast, Spy Kid. -PSI, what are you doing? -[all gasp] The name's No-One. Agent No-One. [gasps] I have some other names I would like to call you right now. Do you really think I would give up the chance to have my family back? -Ha! -Ah! [Scorpion grunts] It's all I've ever wanted. [Golden Brain] Ooh, burn, Agent No-One! Now let's get on with the vanquishing, shall we? But I brought them here so they could see the true scope of your new power. [Golden Brain] You're right. It would be a waste to have them come all this way and not get obliterated by my new omnipotence. [Golden Brain] Oh, thank you, No-One. [gas hissing] [Golden Brain laughing] Finally, I am all-powerful! -Nothing can stop me now! -[all gasp] The serum will now begin to run its course, transforming me into a living, breathing, metahuman god! [laughing] [grunts] Now to finally close the chapter on this story. [all shout] [Golden Brain] Goodbye. What the--? Uh... is that supposed to happen? No, unless... The anti-serum! Nice job, P. You didn't think the "No-One, Agent No-One" thing was too much? Not at all. I think it really nailed the moment. [Golden Brain] What is going on? While you were monologuing, PSI swapped the Pinnoquinox with the anti-serum. [Golden Brain] Huh? Boom! [Golden Brain] What?! Oh, no! [gibbering] Well... [gibbering] I guess you don't want to find your family, then, do you? Ow! I already did. [growls] Seize them! D'oh! Ow! [shouting] Okay, Mission Critical, let's take care of business! [all grunting] -[Swampies grunting] -Ya! Ya! [Gablet] Smell you later, Swampies! [Swampies] Hut, hut, hut-- Ah! [grunting] [grunting] -Ah! -[grunting] -[beeping] -[grunting] [Swampies grunting] Ya! [Golden Brain] Fools! Get up! Get back in the fight! [gibbering] [sighs, shouting] [female voice] Hibernation mode engaged. -Yes. Have a nice nap, Golden Brain. -[beeps] [Golden Brain shouting] -I'll get you for this, Spy Kids! -[gas hisses] [snoring] [female voice] Hibernation mode, complete. -Great job! -Yeah! -[Ingrid] Way to go! -[camera shutter clicks] Now, to finally take care of this. Adios, Pinnoquinox. -[eagle screeches] -Uh, I think we should go now. I do believe Mama Bird has picked up my scent. Desmond and Zedmond Vasquez, what is this about? I was in the middle of my afternoon biscotti. Headmaster, we've been doing some investigating. And have it on good authority that the Cortezes... Are keeping a secret from you. [both] About a mole in Spy Academy. [gasping] [gulps] [both] Hmm. [Vida] A mole? Juni, Carmen, is this true? [both] Yes, it is, Headmaster. [twins] They're lying! We-- Wait, what?! There was a mole calling himself "Agent No-One" -that infiltrated Spy Academy. -[gasps] An old shadow operative from the OSS named Sebastian Oliver. Apparently, Agent Oliver was attempting to get his hands on a serum he created that we happened to find on our first mission. But together, we managed to stop Agent Oliver, destroy the serum, and take down SWAMP. It's all in the mission report. We were just about to tell you ourselves. But Dez and Zed beat us to it. Huh? Yeah, they got so excited when they heard we solved the problem. [twins] But... But... But... -How were we to know! -[all arguing] And what of this Agent Oliver? Oh, he will not bother us any longer. We can promise you that. But there's one more thing, Headmaster. We wanted to recommend one of our teammates that played a very big role in this operation for a special commendation. Really? A special commendation. Who? Cadet PSI. Huh?! But Junior Cadet PSI is not a member of Mission Critical. He's not even a full academy member. We know, Headmaster, but we'd like to change that. We all think he's more than ready to make the jump to the big team. Yes, we saw Cadet PSI in action. And we have never seen a junior cadet more ready. Well, with that kind of recommendation, how can I possibly say no? Cadet PSI, entry approved! June... uh... Are you serious? We all voted on it on the flight back. It was unanimous. Welcome to Mission Critical. And sorry about name thing. Heat of moment. You understand. Well, try it on, Peter. -Boom! -Hashtag, congrats! -[camera shutter clicks] -Well done! Well, it's finally over. No more SWAMP, no more Pinnoquinox... and no more Golden Brain. It's been quite a ride, huh? -That's an understatement. -[camera shutter clicks] Hey, I just wanted to say you're a pretty good co-leader, you know. Thanks, Juni. You're not so bad yourself. By the way, if anyone asks, I'll deny I ever said that. Yeah. Me, too. [both laugh] [kids laughing]
