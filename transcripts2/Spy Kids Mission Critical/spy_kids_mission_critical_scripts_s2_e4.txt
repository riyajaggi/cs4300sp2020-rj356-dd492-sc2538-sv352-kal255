 -[squeals, groans] -Ugh. I think I'm gonna be sick. -[sighs] -Yep. Definitely gonna be sick. His runway work is not half bad. For amateur. -Totes! -[groans] [cadets whooping] -[Juni] Humph. -[sighing] What I wouldn't give for a SWAMP attack right now. [watch beeping] Alert! Alert! Juni Cortez, danger! Thank you, Golden Brain. [goons grunting] [goon] Huh? [grunts] [goon 2] Huh? Hmm.

 -[goon grunts] -[yelps] Hey... [grunts] [beeping] Who was that, Headmaster? Unfortunately, we have no idea. And this wasn't the only one. The mystery agent knocked out several different SWAMP locations we weren't aware of until now. Wow. Information like that could really help us stay two steps ahead of Golden Brain. Yeah. With someone like this on our side, we could really score a major victory against old Gold Dome. Did someone say "major victory"? [clicks tongue] -Ooh...! -Hmm? -[chuckles, snorts] -[sighs] Not sure if you all heard, but you are looking at the new face of Espionage & Intrigue Magazine. [chuckles] Not sure if we heard? There was a whole parade about it! Good thing it was before lunch or Clemp would have had mopping to do. -[both growl] -Ah, yes. I remember when I was the face of Espionage & Intrigue. Seems like only yesterday. Mission Critical, we must find out who this mystery agent is. The information they have may be very valuable to us, but we also cannot have a rogue agent making their own rules. Arrivederci, bambini. "Face of Espionage & Intrigue, 1972." 1972? How is that even possible? She doesn't look a day over 30. -A good moisturizer can do wonders. -Hmm. So, are you going to check out the locations for clues? Not yet. Golden Brain's tricky. Never can tell if this could be one of his traps. -Right. Good point. -[Ace] I've got it. -You know who the mystery agent is? -Mystery agent? No. Even better. I got everyone a complimentary copy of my magazine cover. -One for you, one for you, -Huh? -and one for you. -Ugh! [moans] Why don't you take two, Tango? -[clicks tongue] -[laughs] Thanks, Ace-mate. I was thinking about getting a puppy. This will come in handy with house training. Humph! Whatever, Junior. No spy has ever been the face of Espionage & Intrigue for back-to-back years. But I'm gonna be the first. Now if you'll excuse me, I have facial training to do. -[sighing] -All right, now that the Ace show is over, -let's get back to work. -[sighing] Even you, Tango. [sighs] Hey! [Ace chuckling] Hmm? Oh, if it isn't the face of not bothering to show up for mission briefings on time. I had important work to do. It takes a lot to look this good. Plus, I only have 363 days to train for next year's cover. You're fine with that, right, Tango? [sighing] Ah-hh! PSI, you had something to share? Yes. I color-enhanced the satellite image to see if we could pick up any additional clues to our rogue agent. -And... boom! -Eh? Improv. Hmm? I'm pretty sure that's a rock. No. It's him, Juni. I know it! PSI, magnify that satellite image. Glitch, bring up a picture of Improv. Mm-hmm. Gablet, access dossier photo number six-one, please. [beeping] Ooh! Super cute. Who's that? No one special. [chuckles] [Carmen] Now if you look very carefully, you can see the same high cheekbones, the strong jaw line. [chuckles] The eyes. Hey, Tango, did I mention that my eyes won both the Piercing and Steely Gaze competitions? Ugh! [Carmen sighs] Ah-hh! Yeah, but he's no face of Espionage & Intrigue, right? [Gablet] Probably because he didn't compete. -Huh? -According to my algorithms, Agent Improv is actually 1.5 percent more symmetrical than you. He's what? Gablet! IDK. Hashtag, sorry. I still haven't worked out all the bugs with her yet. And no one's perfectly symmetrical, BT-dubs. -[Gablet] Yeah-uh. Check it. -[gasps] [Gablet] Your vermilion border is .03 millimeters thicker on the left, your earlobes have a full quarter centimeter differential. Nice job hiding it with your hair. And don't even get me started on your philtral ridge. OMG, Gablet! What has gotten into you today? Yeah? Well, symmetry isn't everything! Improv may have the numbers, but can he do this? -Juni, you know I'm right. -Tango? -It's Improv. I just told you. -[Juni sighs] -Can you just stop! You know I'm right. -Awkward! Don't worry. That was just phase one. Here comes the wink and hearty chuckle. -You didn't solve the problem. -For once, it's not right. -It's just not right. It's not possible. -Listen to your sister. Okay. I didn't want to have to do this, but this calls for the W-A-D-P. The "Wink and Double Point." The ol' "WA-DAP." [slurps, spits] No, not the "WA-DAP." No one can resist that. Why won't you listen? You never listen. -WA-DAP! -Listen to your sister, Juni! Ace, what are you doing? -Why won't you just listen to me? -[Gablet] It's all about the symmetry. Gablet, what has gotten into you? Quarter-centimeter differential? And what's a "philtral ridge"? Calm down, Ace, anger lines will ruin your face. But what if Improv gets nominated next year? I'm sunk. Maybe some soothing didgeridoo will help. [man] Hey there, need a new face? -Let me help! -Huh? I'm Dr. Chad Jericho. And superspies from around the globe have been making Chad Jericho their one-stop shop for all of their face-related spy needs. Why isn't my music working? New identity? Special missions? Deep cover! I do it all! So when you're ready for your new look, let me make your next face your best face. [sighs] [didgeridoo music playing] [screams] Run! [cadet gasps] [yelps] [screams] [gasps] [screaming] WA-DAP! -[screaming] -[gasps] [all laughing] Oh, look, if it isn't the face of "Not As Good As Improv." I take back compliments. You are not even good for amateur. Totes. You'll never be as good as Improv. Never, I say. Never! [group] Never. Never. Never! [gasps, panting] Just a dream... but it felt so real. Too real. [groans] Ugh! [gasps] Huh? -Huh? -Ugh! Hey! Take it easy, Ace. It was only a dream. -Only a dream. Your face is fine. -[laughing] What are you laughing at? I am not a monster! I'm almost perfectly symmetrical. [gasps] Get it together, Ace. You're still the face of Espionage & Intrigue Magazine. You're still the face. [sighs] Time to do your facial exercises. [yelps] Symmetry! How did I never see this before? Hmm? Dr. Jericho? "To be the best, you've got to look your best. Don't face your problems, solve your problems with a new face." Okay, Dr. Jericho, let's see what you got. Are you ready... for your new face? Are you excited? [laughing] I'm excited. [Golden Brain] Hard to tell. You only have the one expression. All right! This nose, with his eyes, that mouth, and... whoa! The other one's ears on that cranium! [Golden Brain] Excellent. I am very close to obtaining the Pinnoquinox serum and thus, getting into my new superhuman android body. But it will all be for nothing without the perfect face to go along with it. -[Jericho] Voilà! -Huh? -Ew, that's-- -Perfection! I know. It's what I do. -[Golden Brain] "Terrifying." -Oh. Is it the nose? -We could go Roman. -No, no! Hold on! Don't go rushing to the Roman! I don't want options. I want perfection. A singular vision to match my powerful new body. A golden Adonis. Oh. [chuckles] Well, I'm very sad you didn't like what I picked out for you. [Golden Brain] You are? But I assure you that I will have your perfect face. Chad Jericho never lets a client down. You can trust this face, Golden Brain. [Golden Brain shudders] Ugh! That is unnerving. Time is of the essence, Chad. I don't care what you have to do or how you do it. Get me my face or I will be forced to take drastic action. Mm-hmm, a negative review. No, please, anything but that. My reviews are my life. [Golden Brain] It appears I have your attention now. At least I think I do. Hard to tell. I do, right? No matter. Get me my face! [Juni] It's impossible, Carm. Those two Swampies are too far from each other to be one person. Not for Improv! -[Juni] It's not right. -I have really good eyesight. Still not sure what got into Gablet earlier. She was acting totes weird. You know, I've been thinking, maybe I should enter the Face of Espionage & Intrigue competition next year. [laughing] You? What? I do have a certain urbane charm. Don't I? [slurps] Okay, let us see runway walk. [grunts] [chuckles] [gasps, yelps] [Glitch gasps] [yelping] How was that? If I could feel pity, I would feel that for you. Instead, I must laugh. Ha. [moans] [Jericho on recording] A new identity. A new beginning. A new life. We have thousands of looks to choose from, with new ones coming in all the time. And if you buy a new face today, you'll receive a punch card good for one free face after every five. Every five faces? [mumbling] -Uh, maybe this was a mistake. -[receptionist] Patient 24601. The doctor will see you now. [mumbles] [sighs] [Jericho] No. No. Wrong. Terrible. Ugh. Hate it. Nope. Wrong. Ugh. Nope. [receptionist] Dr. Jericho. Patient 24601 to see you. [angelic music playing] The Golden Adonis. What, mate? Oh, nothing, nothing. Dr. Chad Jericho, facial reconfigurement artist. So, you're here about your face, I take it. Yes, I thought that-- You could be a little more "traditionally" handsome. Well, no, actually, I just wanted to be more symmetrical. You know, just little changes. [chuckling] Nonsense. Nonsense. Let's just have a look-see. Okay, first we'll start with a full eye bleaching for shine, then lip plumping, and then... yep, you guessed it, brow implants. Uh, what's-- what's that mean? -Oh, lucky day. -Whoa! [Dr. Jericho] It means you are a perfect candidate for a full face transplant. Wait. You want to take my face off? I thought maybe something small. Well, sure, it starts small, but, move an ear here, and a lip there, suddenly, those small things start to add up. And you-- [laughs] you've got a lot of small things. But... I'm almost symmetrical. [laughing] Do you think that I became the man I am today by accepting "almost" symmetrical? [laughing] Well, okay, maybe I'm wrong about you. Maybe "almost" is good enough for you, and that's fine, yeah. Maybe you're content to sit there, with that face, watching life's real winners pass you by. No, I'm not, but this all just seems really extreme. Sometimes you've got to do the extreme to stay the best. And you do want to stay the best, don't you? -[gulps] Uh-huh. -Wonderful! Step outside for just a moment -and I will get everything ready. -[Ace grunts] Whoa! Oof! [beeping] [Golden Brain] Oh, Chad, this is unexpected. -You look excited? Yes? -I am. Oh! You have my face? Yes. But there's just one tiny problem. It happens to be in use at the moment. But I am about to take care of that. [cackling] Wait. What am I doing? A full-face transplant? Am I bonkers? [mumbling] [receptionist] But you'll finally be perfect. Look at yourself. Look deep. No. My whole life, I have been trying to be perfect, and it's never enough. Nothing is perfect. After all, I am still the youngest face of Espionage & Intrigue ever. Who cares if I don't win next year? -But you'll finally be perfect-- -No. I've made up my mind. Dr. Jericho, I've changed my mind. I'm keeping my face right where it is. What? Ace, I... I thought we discussed this. You were going to be perfect! This angers me greatly. -It does? Huh? -[slams] [whirring] [laughs] You might not want a new face, but I'm still going to need your old one. Uh, I'm feeling kind of attached to it at the moment. [scanner whirrs] [laughs] Don't worry. I'm a doctor. I can fix that for you. -[grunts] -[snaps] Get off me! Now, hold still. This won't hurt... forever. [cackling] I'm telling you, Carm, the rogue agent isn't one person. It's two. Hi, honey. Is everything okay? Everything but Juni's brain. Mom, would you please tell Carmen that you're the ones that have been taking out the secret SWAMP bases? Secret SWAMP bases? What are you talking about, Junito? -So, it wasn't you? -[Ingrid] What wasn't us? Just Agent Improv taking down some secret SWAMP bases by himself. Agent Improv? I thought you hadn't seen him since your last encounter. Carmen has. Every time she closes her eyes. -Huh? Juni! -Oh, Carmen, honey, how adorable. You have a crush. -[growls] -Ay, no, no, no. I do not like this. Are you telling me my only daughter is falling in love with a... a superspy? It's okay, honey, it's okay. It turned out fine for us. Sorry, Mom, Dad, gotta go. Spy stuff calling! [Awesome laughing] I hope you had fun, because now I'm gonna prove that the mystery man is Improv, right after I give you a taste of my new Shock Globs! Remember, we're family! -[Ace] Crikey! Crikey! -Um, guys, it's an SOS from Ace. Hmm. Probably to alert us he's lost in his own eyes, again. OMG, I don't think so. The signal isn't coming from inside the Academy. It's coming from somewhere in the city. -Scared emoji. -The city? He's not just trying to get our attention. He must really need help. Luckily, every SOS signal has embedded GPS coordinates. So with just a few clicks... Yeah! Hashtag, got 'em. All right, Mission Critical, suit up. The mystery can wait. We've got a teammate to save. [grunting] Golden Brain is going to be so pleased. [cackling] The perfect face to go with his new body. Golden Brain? Whoa! Leave that face alone! [receptionist] I'm sorry, sir. I told them they needed an appointment. Yes. And they'll need more than a few to correct what I'm about to do to them. [Scorpion] Hup! Huh! [gasps] [Scorpion yells] I need that face! Agh! We can't get close to Ace with that laser firing everywhere, and we can't stop Dr. Frankenweird when he keeps blocking all our attacks! [grunts] I believe I can assist with some of that. Time to dance! Oh, dear. [yelps] Juni! You get Ace. I'll handle the doc. -[cackling] -[Awesome yelping] Ever play Got Your Nose, for real? Globinator, go! Shock Blobs, away! [shuddering] [groans] -[Awesome yelling] -[crashing] Let's get out of here, Ace! -This won't hurt... -[whirrs] ...forever. [screams] [monitor beeping] [Golden Brain] Chad, you're looking... different. [Jericho] Unfortunately, your face got away. But don't worry, I'll get it. I never disappoint a client. You can trust this face, Golden Brain. You say it seemed like the universe wanted you to go to Jericho? I know. It sounds silly, but it's true. First, my music player told me about it. Then my face looked strange in the mirror, then I saw his ad. There were just so many signs pointing me there. That is a lot of coincidences. Too many. [panting, yelps] -I think there's something you should see. -Eh? [Awesome] I found it in our room. -[gasps] -[Glitch, Scorpion] Whoa! That's what I was talking about. It looks like it has a sophisticated real-time image editor built in to warp the reflection. Like a funhouse mirror. -There is nothing fun about this. -Huh? [Juni] "Jericho Products." This is one of Jericho's trick mirrors. So someone tricked me into visiting that crackpot? Junior! Hey, it wasn't me! The magazine was open to his ad on your bed! No, we were all working on the rogue agent problem. Well, it's totes good, then, that Ace sent us that SOS. SOS? I didn't send any SOS. So someone lured Ace to Jericho and sent an SOS. Why let us know where he was? All that did was get us out of the Academy. Wait. Jericho said that Golden Brain needed a new face to go with his new body. Huh. But to get his new body, Golden Brain would need... [both] The Pinnoquinox serum! Golden Brain is still after it, and he knows we have it. But what good does getting us away from the Academy do? Unless... it was all a distraction. A distraction from the inside. Oh, no, you guys. Golden Brain has a mole in Spy Academy.
