 [Murna] Attention, cadets! This is Murna, your Academy information officer, with a special reminder. It's Parents Weekend, that means you need to-- [woman] Good morning, superspy children. This is Flurna, Murna's mother from Mapleville. Don't forget to clean your dorm rooms and brush your teeth-- -[speaker squeals] -[Murna] Mom! That's my microphone. [Flurna] Oh! Murna, is that a zit on your chin? [Murna] Shh, Mom, not now. Parents Weekend. Finally!

 I can't remember how long it's been since I've seen Mom and Dad. [moans] You excited, Juni? We get to compete in the Battle of the Best Spy Family. It's tradition! Yeah, great. Never been happier. Hmm. I'm sure my parents will be the first to arrive. They are Mr. and Mrs. Awesome, after all. Overachievers, just like their son. I bet my father will get here first. Well, that's no fair, Scorpion. Your father already works here. -Fair or not, I win. [slurps] -[groans]

 Ah! I'm really looking forward to meeting your parents, Ace. Hmm? Oh, they might not make it. Our house was infested by wallabies. Wallaby infestation? That's a thing? Yeah, in Australia! [Gablet] Hey! This just in, G. You've got Mom and Dad calling. -OMG! It's my 'rents! -[beeps] [Mom] Hey, valley girl. Like, we're totally running late. We met these excellent dudes at the Circle-J who were jammed into a phone booth with a bunch of people in totally tubular historical costumes. It was like, most excellent! But we're back on the road now. See you soon! Aw-ww! Giant heart emoji. -Huh? -[Gablet beeps] -Huh? -I almost forgot. I have Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez on hold! [beeps] Carmen. Junito. Mom! Dad! Are you on your way? We can't wait to see you. Yeah, right. Can't wait. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, we will not be able to make it to Parents Weekend. We're so sorry. But we love you so much and we'll see you very soon. -[rings] -[Gablet] Bummer. Yeah, that's terrible. Oh, well. Juni, what's up with you? Don't you want to see Mom and Dad? -[rustling] -Hmm? [moans] Hey, P? Uh, how's it going? How do you think it's going? It's Parents Weekend, Juni. You'll understand if I don't feel much like hanging around for it. I'd do anything to see my parents again. Everyone will have their families. I just wish I had mine. P, you've got me and Carmen and-- I don't even see you anymore, Juni. You never invite me to mission planning. You never even tell me where you're going these days. No, it's just... You know what? Come with me. Boom. So this is where you've been lately! Yeah, we needed to find a location that was absolutely mole-proof. Wow, this place is so cool, Juni. And there's no record of this library in any of the OSS files. Nope. Totally lost in time. Now you know where I've been. Sorry I didn't tell you about it sooner. Now let's get back upstairs before everyone starts worrying about where we went. [Golden Brain sighs] [groans] -[Therese] Mr. Brain! -[Golden Brain] Huh? Sorry to interrupt your cartoons, but I have some great news! [Golden Brain] Let me guess, Therese. Has the Arctic snow tick been removed from the endangered species list? Oh, that would be so wonderful, but no. Your Isochamber is complete! Let's do a victory twirl, Mr. Brain. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah! [chuckles] [Golden Brain sighs] What's wrong, Mr. Brain? You didn't do a victory twirl. [Golden Brain] Yes, you will forgive me if I'm not feeling particularly "twirly" at the moment, Therese. What do you mean, Mr. Brain? [Golden Brain] Although the Isochamber is complete, it is only half the equation. It's nothing without the serum! Serum, Mr. Brain? [Golden Brain gasps] Yes, the serum that Agent Noone is procuring for me in the Amazon for my dolphin net injury, of course! Oh, this darn rotator cuff. Ow! [chuckles] Ah, I wondered what his mission was. It's medicinal. I have faith that Agent Noone will pull through for you. [singing] ♪ Do-dee, do-dee, do-do, do-do ♪ -[Golden Brain] Therese, you naive fool. -[beeps] -Aha! -[beeps] Whoa! Ugh! [moans] Talk. Uh, about anything in particular? You know something. And it has to do with Mom and Dad. That's why you're happy they're not coming this weekend. So, what is it? No, really, I don't-- I've known you since the day you were born, Juni. And I know you're hiding something. Spill! [moans] [sighs] Uh...! Come on. Juni, I'm not just co-leader of Mission Critical. I'm also your big sister. You can talk to me. Okay. It's about Dad. Uh-huh. What about him? Why don't you sit down instead? Okay, here goes. You know the creator of the Pinnoquinox Serum? Sebastian Oliver. The OSS shadow operative? What about him? Well, that's just an alias. Then what's his real name? [moans, winces] Gregorio Cortez. [laughs] What? Come on, Juni. That's impossible. -What's the real--? -No, Carmen, it's true. Wait. Dad created the serum? Without OSS approval. How do you know this? Well, uh... [chuckles] that's a funny story. -Juni...! -Yeah. Uh... Right. Remember that solo mission I went on? Well, it was actually for Dad. What? He needed me to get a top secret file from the old OSS HQ. And I kinda looked at it. Why would Dad do this? And why wouldn't he tell us? He could get kicked out of the OSS if anyone ever found out! [sighs] Oh! I can't believe he'd be so selfish. So irresponsible, so-- Geesh, Carm, you sound just like him. I do not! Now you see why I'm glad they're not coming this weekend. -Now we won't have to-- -[both] Surprise! Carmen, Junito. Happy Parents Weekend! [both chuckle] It is so nice to be walking these halls again. Remember our first Parents Weekend? Yeah, really brings back memories. And some questions, too, like, why are you here? [Ingrid] Hmm. Uh, I mean... you said you weren't coming. Well, even on a secured line, it isn't safe to disclose our plans. So we decided to use a little deception. [chuckles] We are spies, after all. Yeah, deception. What a concept. -It also gave us a great opportunity... -What? ...to surprise you two. Who doesn't love a surprise? [both chuckle] [both] Humph. Well, I for one could really use a fun-filled family weekend. I hope you two are ready for the Battle of the Best Spy Family competition. [chuckles] I know I am. Juni, we have to talk to them. No, we can't! Then he'll know I looked at the file. -Juni. -No, Carm. We need to act normal and make sure nobody suspects a thing. [growls] -Okay? -Huh? Fine. Great. But that doesn't mean I can't talk to him. Carmen, no! Agh! I knew I should've kept my big dumb mouth shut. [voices overlapping] Okay, so far so good. I think everyone's keeping to themselves. Nothing to worry about. [Immortata] Oh, Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez! [groans] Me and my big dumb mouth. Ciao! I am so excited you are here. What a glorious family weekend, no? [both chuckle] Yes. And we're excited to be here. So tell me, what have you two troublemakers been getting into lately, eh? [gasps] Whoo! Will you look at the time? We should get ready for the Battle of the Best! You two need to stretch out. You're not getting any younger, you know. And we probably shouldn't monopolize Headmaster Immortata's time. She has so many people to greet. Right, Headmaster? Oh, well, I guess I... Exactly. Talk soon! -Junito, what has gotten into you? -Uh... Just trying to keep us focused. Talking will get us off our game. We should just keep our mouths shut. Right, Carmen? [Carmen sighs] -[Gregorio] The Vasquezes, eh? -[all grunt] [chuckles] This weekend just got very interesting. Wait, you know them? Know them? [chuckles] Jaime and Kopi were our biggest rivals during our time at Spy Academy. Let me go over and say hello for old times' sake. -No! -Hmm? Now, Gregorio, remember, this is a fun family weekend. Yeah, Dad. Mom's right. A fun and quiet family weekend. Real quiet. [Dez] Well, well, well, well. If it isn't the Cortez clowns. Can it, Dez. -I'm Zed, he's Dez! I'm a-- -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. I've got more important things to worry about than this. -[Gregorio] Fegan Floop? -Huh? [Gregorio] I see that cartoon character Floop is still here. I have a few questions for him. Come on, Dad, the competition is about to start. Don't want to be late! [chuckles, sighs] Oh! Parents, cadets, welcome to the Battle of the Best Spy Family! Our first event is the world famous OSS pie-eating contest! Looks like it's you and me, Dad. [gasps] Nope! Me and Dad. Called it! Some father-son bonding time. [groans] I hope you're not expecting to win Battle of the Best Spy Family. Because we've trained for this moment for years. You trained? For a family event? It's supposed to be fun. -And it will be... -Watching you guys go down. [group] Vasquezes! Ha! We will beat you just like we did every year at Spy Academy. Oh, really? What have you been doing in deep cover that makes you so sure of that? -Well, I'll tell you, I-- -[Juni gasps, grunts] Whoops. Sorry. False start! [growls] Let the games begin! [Immortata] Andiamo! This is great, Carm. As long as he's eating, he's not talking. You know, Jaime, let me tell you about what we were doing in deep cover. [grunts] Juni, what is the meaning of this, eh? [gasps, chuckles] -I was just telling Jaime-- -[splashes] Vasquezes! And the winners are... the Vasquezes! [group] Vasquezes! Ay, Dios mío. [groans] They slipped? [chuckles] Apparently, my parents are still delayed. My papa accidentally locked my mama in the car and they are waiting for roadside assistance. This is so unlike them. [yelps] Yeah. I wonder where they get it from? [Mom Glitch] Hey, valley girl! Hey, hey! You guys here? Like, almost. We were on our way when we totally ran into a group of kids with a treasure map. They were looking for pirate gold to save their homes from a land developer. Gag me with a spoon, right? But we're on our way! Be there soon! -[chimes] -[Ace] Ah! This must be my parents checking in about the wallaby infestation. They should be at stage two by now-- the negotiation. Negotiating? With wallabies? Yep. And you thought emus were tough negotiators. You haven't seen nothing like a wallaby, mate. [Gablet] Actually, no. My scanners just intercepted an unauthorized transmission from inside the academy. OMG! Is it the mole? [No-One, distorted] Operation is moving forward well. Event providing good cover as expected. There is nothing more important for a family than teamwork, no? And you will need that to win the three-legged race! Hmm? Carmen? Oh, no! -Ha! You Cortezes... -Are outclassed. [both] Vasquezes! Fine. Yeah, Vasquezes. Whatever. Don't care. I just need to-- [gasps] Hmm. [grunts] Oh! [mutters] Carmen's shenanigans. -Is everything okay, honey? -Mm-hmm. [tweets] -Whoo! -[cheering] [panting] Hey, where are we going? Oh, no. She's gonna try and talk to him! -I have to stop this! -What? Whoa! [all grunting] -[whistle tweets] -Junito! [Immortata] And the winners are... the Floops! [growling] And now, for the final event, the burping contest! [gurgling] Ugh! Is everything all right with you two? You seem a little... Who's--? -[chuckles] -[Carmen gulps] -Junito! -[Gregorio gulps] Juni, what is going on with you? [mumbling] [whirring] [gulps] [gulps] I can't believe you were gonna talk to Dad. I know you want this whole thing to blow over, but that's not gonna happen. We need to talk to him. Shh! Keep spraying. [loud burping] [Murna] Mom! [applause] [burps] [burps] Humph! [feeble burping] Ah! And it looks like our winners are... [burp rumbles] Ooh! Hmm? Okay, the winners of the burping contest and the Battle of the Best... the Floops! I do think you should get that checked out. Yeah! We did it! Well, we gave it our best shot. And now, maybe we can focus on spending some time together without distraction. Yeah, family time. Ugh. -Huh? -[yelps] [beeps] We got you now, mole! [gasps] Huh? [Glitch panting] OMG! The signal just stops here! [groans] Angry face emoji! Unless they're a Chewy Dewy Bar, the mole gave us the slip again! Hmm. Perhaps all is not lost, friends. It seems our mole was trying to lighten their load. OMG! A voice modulator! [crowd cheering] [cheering, applause] -We have to say something! -No, we don't. -We can't avoid it forever, Juni. -Just for the weekend. Then they'll leave and we'll never have to talk about it again. Never have to talk about what again? [chuckling] You both have been acting very strange all day. -What's the matter? -It's nothing. No, Juni. It's not nothing. You know you can tell us anything. Who's Sebastian Oliver? Where--? Where did you hear that name? [sighs] Oh, Cortezes, why so serious? I must admit, I was a little surprised myself that the Floops won and not you, but that is no reason for these sad faces. Smile! Parents Weekend is just getting started. Come on! Now, let's have some fun. Cappuccinos for everyone! [growls] [books thump] Ugh! This bed smells like a musty kangaroo. [doorbell rings] Dad, I'm really sorry. I know I shouldn't have looked at the file. -You trusted me, and I went and... -No, Junito. I never should have put you in that position to begin with. This is my fault. I made the Pinnoquinox to help mankind. To create meta-spies to safeguard our world. All those secrets I was keeping were just to protect all of you. I never meant to hurt anyone. You know, Dad, you taught us that a team is like a family, but you forgot that a family is also like a team. Well, it's a good thing the serum's formula file is safely back in my hands then, hmm? We won't have to worry about the Pinnoquinox anymore and we can put all of this behind us. Uh... yeah, right. Uh, well... while we're on the subject of secrets-- Secrets? The Pinnoquinox? Yeah, we sort of found it. And we've been trying to keep it out of Golden Brain's hands ever since. [chuckles] Crazy, right? The Pinnoquinox is here? -[doorbell rings] -Aztec! The mole dropped a clue! A mole? What other secrets do you have to share? [groans] Ugh! Is this a bad time? [No-One on recording] Operation is moving forward well. Event providing good cover as expected. -[clicks off] -A mole? In Spy Academy? But the Pinnoquinox-- It's in a mole-proof hiding spot. -[Gablet buzzing, beeping] -I've run every diagnostic possible, but the decoder isn't giving me any info. I tried de-scrambling it, but it has every firewall and security tech I have ever seen. [groans] Frustrated emoji. Juni, remember how I always tell you to stop mimicking people? Yeah, you say it's annoying and impolite. Well, I'm giving you permission to be annoying and impolite right now. Mimic the mole's voice. Then Glitch can unfilter it. Whoo! Hashtag, genius! [beeping] -[beeps] -[beeps] [beeps] -[clicks] -Operation is moving forward well. Event providing good cover as expected. [beeping] [in deeper voice] Operation is moving forward well. Event providing good cover as expected. [beeps] It's not working. Need more mole. [in deeper voice] Operation is moving forward well. Event providing good cover as expected. -[rings] -Yes! Hashtag, got it! [Gablet beeping] [beeping] This is it. It's time to find out who our mole is. Mission Critical, meet Agent No-One. -[beeps] -[voice] Operation is moving forward well. Event providing good cover as expected. Oh, no. It can't! Crikey, that sounds a lot like... Oh, no! Juni, what's wrong? I was just trying to be a good friend. [all gasp]
