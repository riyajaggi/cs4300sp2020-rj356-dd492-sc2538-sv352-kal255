 [gasps, whimpers] Ha! [gasps] No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Anything but that! [gasping, whimpering] Oh, oh! Whoa! [whimpering continues] Please, stop. Stay away from me! -Hey, Ace, mate. Have you seen my...? -[Ace whimpering] Is that some sort of Australian dialect I'm not familiar with? Huh? -[whimpering] -Whoa! You okay? It's... It's... It's... -[mumbling] -What? What is it? There! It's down there! Be careful!

 [sighs] Wait, you mean, this little guy? Ha! I can't believe you're afraid of a tiny ant. -[whimpering] -He's not the kind that bites. Whoa! [gasping] Hmm. -Well, well, well. -Hmm? Is there a problem? -Hmm? [grunts] -[both] Hey! [Dez] This isn't over, Cortez! -[whimpering] -Hmm. [soldiers grunting] [Golden Brain] Lieutenant, welcome home, glad you're back. Let's get down to the business at hand. As you know, S.W.A.M.P. is rebuilding. Heh, it's coming right along. And I have extended invites to every villainous ne'er-do-well and depraved thug across the globe to join our nefarious cause, utilizing all my evil grapevines including Dregs-List. And to accommodate the influx of new operatives, we are going to need to expand our training facility. Extra barracks. Some monkey bars in the yard for advanced calisthenics and a giant-- Wait a moment, what is this here? -Hmm? -Oh. It's a spa for the goons, sir. I just thought it'd be nice to have something for the boys. [Golden Brain growls] Hmm... [sighs] Okay, I'll do it, sir. -[electricity zaps] -[soldier yells, grunts] [Golden Brain] Lieutenant, even though we have Agent No One in place, if we are to succeed in our mission of total and complete world domination, then we must expand and grow our operation. -We are... -In deep trouble. [Golden Brain gasps] Oh. Therese. What a pleasant surprise. I do so love how you creep up on me like this. Mr. Brain, I can't believe what I found out about S.W.A.M.P. -while going through our cost reports. -[Golden Brain] Found out? Oh! Well, um, I'm sure I can explain why it might appear... We're broke. ...that we're broke. Wait, what? -Yup. Broke. Busted. Tapped out. -[soldier groaning] Oh, think about all those helpless orphaned sea otters. Who will help them? [Golden Brain] Sure, yes, the otters. [mock crying] Tragic. But what about my expansion plans? On hold. Indefinitely. I'm sorry, Mr. Brain, I know how excited you were. Between you and me, I think your last accountant was a common thief. [Golden Brain] Huh? A thief, yes. I think you're right, Therese. A thief indeed. And now allow me to discuss next steps with my associate. But, Mr. Brain, what about the orphaned sea otters? [Golden Brain] Yes, I will be thinking of them. -[soldier grunts] -[Golden Brain] Upsie-daisy. Lieutenant, it would appear the time has come for us to become thieves. -[soldier] Huh? -[Golden Brain] But far from common. Mission Critical, these are all intercepted S.W.A.M.P. transmissions from just this week alone. -What are they saying? -I was hoping you could tell us. -[monitor beeps] -[garbled chatter] Carm, it sounds exactly like Tía Roxanna when she takes out her teeth. Whatever it's saying, it's a lot of chatter for one week. Golden Brain must be planning something big. -[Juni] Huh? -I'll start running diagnostics. I totes have some new tricks I wanna try out. Hashtag, YOLO. Okay, I don't understand anything she just said. Don't worry. It's all good. -[monitor beeping] -[Ace gasps] Ace. Focus. Ah. Cadet Ace? Lost something? No. Not at all. I'm just checking the control room for bugs. I mean-- I mean, not bugs. -Bugs, S.W.A.M.P. listening devices. -[Juni chuckles] [chuckles] Pfft, who'd be afraid of bugs, right? -[Juni grunts] -[monitor beeps] Hey, the map! It looks like the transmissions are coming from locations near banks. -[Carmen] Juni, you're right. -Hashtag, nailed it! Armored car heist in progress. [tires screeching] Those are S.W.A.M.P. goons, all right. You can tell because they never use their turn signals. Despicable. -Glitch, jam their transmissions. -Huh? Mm-hmm. Scorpion, follow alongside the truck and capture any thugs who try to flee. -Awesome... -Way ahead of you, Tango. I'll lay down an oil slick from my Suit of Awesome! I'll take up position to direct the vehicle with Sheila. Good thinking. I'll cover him. I understand you're in need of an oil change, chaps? -One perfect oil slick coming up! -[soldier] Wha? [coughing] That is not oil, it is sugar! Oh, dear. Wrong sleeve. [chuckles] -[Ace] Hmm. -Mm-hmm. [grunts] -[grunts, gasps] -[tires screech] -[engine sputters] -[grunts, gasps] I've got sugar in my jet tank. [gasps] Sugar? Ants are attracted to sugar. Take the shot, Ace! [whimpering] -Ants... Attracted to... Sugar. -[Awesome grunting] -[whimpering continues] -Ace, shoot! [yelps] -[crashes] -[tires screeching] [gasps, whimpers] What just happened? [Ace sighs] No way. Come on, it might actually help. Uh-uh. I don't want you tinkering with my noggin. It's not tinkering, it's hypnosis. This book from the old library says it can cure anything. Too good to be true, mate. Come on, the B-Team is sniffing around! Vida is getting suspicious, and we nearly blew the last mission! We need to do something about this. Fine. Okay, good. So, tell me all of your issues. -We're gonna knock 'em out in one shot. -It's really not that bad. I'm just afraid of birds, ants, bees, crickets, giraffes, if they're not in a species-appropriate habitat, I snore, get heat rashes, cold sweats, I'm color-blind, afraid of the dark, I have a cookie obsession, and once in a while, my nose whistles "Waltzing Matilda." And I'm pretty sure I've been abducted by aliens, twice. -Uh... that all? -Uh-huh. Okay, let's get underway, then. -Ah! -Pens? [gasps] Ballpoints! I mean, is it a ball? Is it a point? Make up your mind, pen! This is gonna be harder than I thought. You good with pencils? Mm-hmm. Okay, the book says you stare at the pencil and listen to my voice. I'm telling you, Junior... -Sleep. -...you will never be able to hypno... -[snoring] -Whoa! That was easy. Now administer post-hypnotic suggestion. Okay. Ace, you will no longer be afraid of birds and ants and bees and, um... [sighs] Oh, man, I can't remember all the other stuff. Uh... Cookies... I should have wrote it down. -Oh, yeah, pens. Aliens. -[snoring, snorts] Oh, no! I need to move faster. Uh... Ace, when you wake up, you won't be afraid of anything outside of this room! Nothing at all. -[grunts] -Uh... Ace, how do you feel? I feel... great, actually. Good. Are you afraid of anything? No. No, I don't think so. [gasps] Huh? Ah! Get away from me, you monster! Monster? What are you talking about? Don't come any closer! -[hyperventilating] -Hmm? [whimpering] I told him not to be afraid of anything outside the room, but I was inside the room. [continues whimpering] [soldier sighs] Sir, I got some more bad news. [Golden Brain] You're about to tell me that the bank job was a failure. That's excellent news. Uh... [stammering] -It is, sir? -[Golden Brain] Yes. That's why I'm the one with the golden brain. You see, Lieutenant, the entire heist was a giant misdirect. Now those pesky spy brats will worry about every other bank in the city while we focus on the big score. The vault at the treasury building, full of countless riches in gold! I know what you're thinking, that vault must be four feet thick. [chuckles] That's why I'm meeting with a new operative today who claims to possess the power to shred solid steel. He calls himself... ♪ Deth Metal ♪ [both grunting] ♪ I'm gonna thrash, I'm gonna shred ♪ ♪ You better run or you'll be dead ♪ [Golden Brain] Yes. Very impressive. So tell me, Deth Metal, where have you been...? Oh. I know you. You're not new at all. You're just that buffoon Otto Tune re-branded! Ah, seize him. Ah, Otto Tune is no more. I crushed him under the weight of my vocal... ♪ Power ♪ -[guitar playing] -[shrieks] [Golden Brain grunts] Hey! Hold it, you! [Golden Brain] Huh? Hmm. Yes. You know, maybe everyone does deserve a second chance after all. Even you, Otto-- Deth Metal. [chuckling] [Deth Metal shrieking] -♪ We're here, you're fools ♪ -[soldiers chanting] Hup, hup, hup. ♪ It's our gold, you will lose ♪ [soldiers grunting] Solid steel. Four feet thick. Ha, ha! What I love! ♪ Heavy metal, yeah ♪ [shrieking] [soldier grunts] [soldiers] Huh? [music playing] All right! Okay, team. We gotta stay sharp. We stopped Golden Brain's last heist, but I'm sure he's planning another. -Where is Aztec? -[gasps] Aztec? Where? He isn't here. I think he slept in PSI's lab last night. [slurps] -Why would he do that? -I don't know. Why you looking at me? [chuckles nervously] -Sorry I'm late. -Ah! [whimpering] Um, I have to go. Uh, I had a bad breakfast burrito. Yeah. Catch up with you guys later. Juni, I know there's something weird going on between you and Ace. -But-- -[Carmen] You two have had your issues. So, whatever you did, just fix it. Or I will. Hmm? [sighs] Look, Ace, we need to talk. I know I haven't been myself lately, but let's talk about you instead, Tango. Whoa! -You tricked me! -Stop! I'm not gonna hurt you. Just face your fear! It's not that hard! Mission Critical's coming apart and the B-Team is trying to take over. I have to fix this. [whimpers] No. Stay away. Ah! No, not that again. It won't work. -I told you, I can't be hypno-- -Sleep. Ace, you will not fear me any longer. You won't be afraid of ants or crickets or giraffes or anything else. In fact, you will have absolutely no fears at all. [grunts] Uh... Uh, Ace? Are you afraid of me? Ha! I ain't afraid of you, Junior. In fact, I ain't afraid of nothing. Yes! That's great! Now let's-- Wait, where are you going? To crush S.W.A.M.P. and take down Golden Brain. Where do ya think I'm going? Sit tight, Junior. If I don't come back victorious, I ain't coming back at all. -[grunts] -No, Ace. [Carmen over walkie] Grab Ace and get to the control room! Right away! [groans] [panting] He's gone? What happened? Since we've been monitoring all the banks and armored car deliveries, we missed an attack on the treasury building. Angry face emoji. All of the gold was stolen by some heavy metal maniac. Looks like the work of one -of Golden Brain's newest henchman. -[squeaking] -Ah! Is there a cricket in here? -It was just my shoe squeaking. [squeaking] Uh, yeah. And where's Ace? Have you guys managed to work things out? -Got it! -Ah! What? Got what? -Crickets? -No. The getaway truck's racing through town. Smiley face emoji. Okay, we'll go after the truck. Juni, get Ace and meet us. We're counting on you to be there. [sighs] [grunting] [gasps, whines] [soldiers chanting] Hup, hup, hup. Huh? -Intruder! -[soldier grunts] -Ah. -[knuckles crack] First catch of the day. -[grunts] -[soldiers groaning] [grunts] -[panting, grunts] -[Ace grunts] -[soldier gasps] -Where ya going, friend? To your boss? -Tell me, where's the Brain? -[grunts] -Near the barracks. -Good answer. [grunts, thuds] This is crazy. Okay, focus, Juni. You can do this. Ace's uniform tracker says he's in there. Just go in, grab Ace, and get out. Ugh, but it's so dark out here. Why is it so dark? -[skittering] -[gasps] Ah! Ants! [screaming, whimpering] Huh? Wait. Ants? I'm not afraid of... I freaked when I heard the cricket. I broke into nervous itching. And now I'm afraid of ants? Oh, no. Somehow, I got all of Ace's phobias! -[birds squawking] -[whimpering] -Glitch, nice work tracking the truck. -It was a snap. I just triangulated their last known coordinates using three geocentric satellites, then had the location beamed directly to our comms. -Success selfie. -[camera shutter clicks] There's no time to wait for Juni and Ace. If the truck reaches the ridge, we'll lose our advantage. Mission Critical, engage! -[guitar playing] -Let's... ♪ Rock ♪ ♪ Feel my power Pulse ripping noise ♪ ♪ I'm more than a man I'm a God among boys ♪ -Who is this metal madman? -Whoever he is, we have to stop him! -♪ Yeah ♪ -[all grunting] If this is what a mosh pit feels like, I'll stick with the classics. [Deth Metal grunting] Okay, Ace. Where are you? -[bird squawks] -[gasps] It's just a bird. Just a bird. [soldier] Uh, huh? -Hmm... Huh? -[muffled gasp] [soldier] Ha. [coughs, grunts] -[soldiers grunting] -Anyone seen my wallaby run through here? -[explosion] -[all grunting] -[grunts] -Aw. I hate when they don't get up. -[grunts] -[Golden Brain] What is going on out here? [soldier] We're under attack! He's a one-man, Australian wrecking crew! [Golden Brain] Capture him. Take him to the barracks. I have a feeling he may not be alone. There he is, get him! [Juni] Ace. [clicking tongue] [all grunting] Ha! Come on! -[grunts] -[soldiers] Hup, hup, hup. [chuckles] You can't stop me, you can only hope to contain me! I have to help him. [distorted wailing] No, no, not a giraffe! -[wailing continues] -[gasps, sighs] Hmm? -[machine beeping] -This machine is making a weird noise! Another intruder! Grab him! -Ah! -[soldiers grunting] He just disappeared. [guitar playing] [Carmen] Keep pushing. We can do it. There's something weirdly familiar about this guy, like we've met before. [playing continues] Tango, if I can hack into the truck's onboard computer, maybe I can shut it down. Gablet, I need your help. Want me to search who super actor Craig Matthews is dating now? [gasps] Did he break up with Jenna Jana? Frowny face emoji. No unauthorized recordings, please! [grunts] -Glitch, look out! -[Gablet] OMG! -Gablet! -Text me later! [clatters] [Awesome grunts] Cover me, Awesome. I'm going in. -[guitar playing] -[Scorpion grunting] -What was that? -Milk and sugar. [both grunt] -[guitar playing] -[shrieking] [all grunting] I very much dislike this guy. -[guitar playing] -[shrieking] He's gonna lose us in the mountains if we don't figure something out. If he makes it to that S.W.A.M.P. base, we'll never get the gold back. [Juni whimpers] [Ace] Hmm. Ace! Let's get outta here. Why? I got 'em right where I want 'em, Junior. -[Ace and Juni grunt] -[Golden Brain chuckles] Ah, you silly, silly, children, thinking you could just run in here and dismantle my operation again. [chuckles] I blame your parents. Question, what happened to the goldfish that used to live in that fishbowl -you call a head? -[Golden Brain growls] Okay, comedians, get to the punchline. Where are the rest of your teammates? -What the--? -Deth Metal is here to stay! [Golden Brain] Oh, no. Come on, Junior! Now's our chance! [Deth Metal laughing] No. We need to get out of here. There's too many of them. I like a challenge. -Ha, yeah, ha! -[fireworks screeching] -Juni? Ace? -What are you doing here? -[shrieking] -[all grunting] Forget the gold. Grab Juni and Ace. -Come on, Ace! Ace, let's run! -[soldiers grunting] [grunts, laughs] [Carmen] Deth Metal is Otto Tune. Ugh. That man has very questionable taste in music and fashion. [grunting] Let's get out of here! [Ace] Aha! -Oh, no. -[growls] -[growls] -[shrieking] ♪ Spy Kids ♪ I really hope that Carmen bought that we were just trying to get ahead of the truck by infiltrating the base. -Thanks. For keeping my secret. -No problem, Ace. I'm sorry for giving you a hard time. I just walked a mile in your sweaty boots and it wasn't fun. -So, should we... -Mm-hmm. When I clap my hands, everything will be back to normal. And we will have no memory of this entire experience. [claps hands] [Golden Brain] Gold, gold, gold! Glorious gold! Ah, Therese! Full steam ahead on that expansion. -As you can see-- -We're still broke. [Golden Brain] What? How? Unfortunately, after paying off all your credit card debt, plus the donation I made to the Organization of Orphaned Sea Otters in your name, it's all gone. [Golden Brain] Yeah, but, but... but... I know. I'm so happy for the otters, too. Take it away, fellas. [Golden Brain] But, surely the sea otters don't need all of it. -[guitar playing] -Oh. -Otto, by the way, you're fired. -What? [Golden Brain] I can no longer afford you or your International Robbery Tour. ♪ When will you see me again? ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ -[Golden Brain sighs] [rock music playing]
