 [Golden Brain] Tink, tink, tink. [chuckling] Mm-hmm. [chuckles] And... hmm... [beeps, chimes] Yes, Agent No-One. I have not heard from you in some time. I know communication has been difficult since the Spy Brats destroyed our secret satellites. But I assume the mission continues as planned? -[No-One, distorted] Um... where are you? -Huh? Oh, I hit video call. What are those paintings?

 -[Golden Brain grunting] -Are you sculpting? [phone clatters] [chuckling] Oh, nothing. Ignore this. Anyway, back to the mission. Do you have the Pinnoquinox serum? The Spy Kids have been quite secretive of late. However, the Academy's annual Agent Hawkins Dance is happening this week and could provide-- Is something the matter? Did you call on a secure line? -Um, they're all secure, aren't they? -No! The Spy Kids are hacking into our signal as we speak! -I must disconnect immediately. -[beeps] But, Agent No-One! The Pinnoquinox!

 Oh, what are you staring at? Thanks to Glitch's quick thinking, we managed to intercept part of the mole's latest communication with Golden Brain. Unfortunately, not enough to find out who the mole is, but we did uncover an important new clue. ♪ Dun-dun-da-da! ♪ The mole's code name, Agent No-One. Hmm? Uh, I missed that. -Agent who? -No-One. -But I heard Glitch mention an agent? -Yes. She did. -Well, then who was it? -No-One. -Are you going to tell me or not? -What? -The agent Glitch mentioned. -I already did. No. I said, "Who's the agent?" And you said, "no one." -Exactly. -What? -The agent. -The agent is what? No. The agent is No-One. -Well, it has to be someone, mate. -Yes. "No-One." -Fine, Junior, don't tell me. -[groans] The name must mean something. [Carmen] It has to clue into the mole's identity somehow. How about in, "I like no one"? Totes. But Professor K would never agree to a lie detector. [sighs] Frustrated emoji! -[gasps] I think I might know a way. -Eh? [Ace] Seriously, can you tell me the name of that agent? -[grunts] It's "No-One." -Huh? I'll find out sooner or later! [rattling] Hey, looking for something? Oh, hey, P, remember those lenses we built to help us find where my mom and dad hid our Halloween candy? The Liar-Liar Lenses. Yeah, we never finished those. Right, but if we just tweaked the refraction angle and upped the-- Found them! [clicks, whirs] [pings] [grunts] So, what do these do, then? The lenses analyze pupil dilation, eye movement, and facial tics. With the new adjustments I just made, if you ask the right questions, they should tell you if someone's lying or telling the truth. Really? So, Carmen, have you decided who you are taking to Agent Hawkins Dance yet? What? [scoffs] No. I haven't even given it much thought. -[alarm blares] -Astonishing. Mm-hmm. -So you're not asking-- -Okay, yeah, yeah. Perfect. They work. Can we get going? We have a mole to question. But I did not get answer. -[Awesome moans] -[sighs] Professor Küpkakke? -[yelps] -Cadet Cortez. Office hours are not for another two and a half minutes. What are you doing here? Um, yes, I was just wondering... OMG. Küpkakke's helmet is throwing off the readings. Since when are you so interested in quantum entanglement, Cadet Cortez? What do you mean? I'm all about tangling and de-tangling quantums, Professor. -[yelps] -You're doing great. [alarm blares] We need to get rid of his helmet. It's throwing off the readings. Und now? -Spider on your helmet! -Was ist das? Yeah! Black widow as big as your face! [screaming] [crashes] Cadet Cortez! Sorry, Professor. Quick question. Are you working for Golden Brain? -What? No. -[dings] Why would you ask me if I am working for the Golden Brains? Golden Brain? What? I didn't say that. Whoops, look at the time. Gotta run! [Carmen] Küpkakke's off the list. So, what do we do now? I don't know. It looks like No-One could be anyone. -Wait. Can you repeat that? -Shh. Visage can become anyone, which means he can also be "No-One." And no one appears to know anything about Clemp. And don't forget, no one can breathe in Ms. Chatting-Botham's class thanks to Lord Merriweather. Well, that settles it, we need to question the faculty. -[huffs, grunts] -The entire faculty. -Ugh! -[watch chimes] -Huh? -[beeps] Hey, Dad. I got your message. Is everything okay? Where's Mom? Your mother is fine. It just was not safe for us to be seen together. So why did I need to come alone? Are we planning a surprise party for Carmen? You know how much she hates surprises. No, no. I asked you here because I have a special request. A mission. -Great! I'll grab Carmen and we-- -No, Junito. This mission is for you and for you alone. A solo mission? But I've never gone on a mission by myself before. Sometimes superspies must undertake missions tailored to their specialties, and this one is perfect for you. I need you to retrieve this from my office at the old OSS Headquarters. The old HQ? Sí, sí. Nobody knows the old headquarters better than you, Juni. Hmm. Now, do you think you can handle this? You can count on me, Dad. Excellent. But, Junito, under no circumstances are you to open that file, eh? It is highly classified. Then, good luck, Agent Cortez. [sighs] Hmm. [young Juni] Dad, look, I'm doing it! [Gregorio] Yes! You are riding without training wheels! [laughing] [young Carmen] Come and get me, Juni! Come and find me! [young Juni] Carmen! Come on! [sighs] Aztec calling Tango. Come in, Tango. [Carmen] Hey. Everything okay? -Yep. Fine. Just wanted to check in. -Whatcha doin', by the way? Oh, it's nothing. I'll be back before you know it. You're not planning a surprise party for me, are you? -[laughing] -You know how much I hate surprises. Okay. We're about to start our faculty interrogations. I have to go. Tango signing off. Dad's office was down this way. Ha. This mission will be a snap. Okay, Mission Critical, everyone has their suspect. And make sure to be inconspicuous. Now, let's go find No-One. [no audio] [dings] [no audio] [dings] [no audio] [buzzes] -[no audio] -[buzzing] [dings] -[no audio] -[dings] [no audio] [dings] [alarm sounds] -[spurts] -[shatters] Dad's office is right down... Huh? Okay. I'll find another way around. Wait. But I just came from-- -[voice over PA] Something different? -Huh? Who's there? [voice] No one. It's nice to finally meet you, Juni Cortez. Uh... how do you know my name? [voice] I know a lot about you, Juni. I know a lot about your entire family. [cackles] -Show yourself. -[voice] Do I scare you? Scared? Me? I don't get scared. I'm a superspy. You're the one that's hiding. Why don't you come and face me? [voice] Why? It's more fun this way. What are you doing in my house? [voice] Your house? [laughs] Oh, Juni, Juni, Juni, this hasn't been your house for quite a while. You're in my house now. [laughing] [Scorpion] Farty feline did this? Ugh! Hashtag, yuck! Then it's a good thing we got through the entire faculty. Eh, not quite the entire faculty. [Carmen] Headmaster Immortata. -[Gablet] She has amazing skin. So jelly. -Totes. Most likely an apricot scrub. Hey, how did you get the yearbook already? They're not out yet. That's just the thing, Tango. It's not this year's yearbook at all. [Carmen] "Spy Academy... 1963"? Cadet Immortata? But she looks exactly the same. What the--? Okay, maybe not apricot scrub. Golden Brain wants the Pinnoquinox to create a new body. Well, what if Headmaster Immortata needs the same serum to keep herself so young? [Glitch gasps] Okay, we interview Vida next. How? The Liar-Liar Lenses are trashed, thanks to that toxic tabby. Glitch, can you program one of your phones to scan for traces of the Pinnoquinox? Totes! If she needs the Pinnoquinox, she'll already have it in her system. That still leaves the matter of getting close enough to Headmaster Immortata to use Glitch's scanner. Wait, the Agent Hawkins Dance. The traditional Headmaster's Dance. Perfect. I will make sure headmaster chooses me as her dance partner, and I will perform the scan. I am proficient in all forms of dance. What will it be tonight? The Castilian Cha-Cha? -No. The Romanian Rhumba. -[Ace sighs] [Gablet] According to the school newspaper, it's... -the Sardinian Tango? -[gasps] [squeals, gasps] The Sardinian Tango. Is something wrong with the Sardinian Tango? [yelps] Please do not say that name. What? Sardinian Tango? [gasps] I thought I'd never hear those words again. It is the most difficult dance ever. Many have tried to master it, but even more have failed. Right. So can you dance it? [groans] I am afraid I cannot. The dance requires a more rugged physique. OMG! Where are we gonna find someone who has that? [Glitch gasps] -What? What are you all looking at? -[others] Hmm! Just need to get to Dad's office, get the file, and get out of here. I wish Carmen was here. [gasps] [voice laughing] Not how you remember the old place, is it? I made some changes. Right. Who's your decorator? Dr. Frankenstein? [voice] Uses humor to deflect from problems. That's from my fifth-grade report card. Mr. Swanson wrote that. -How did you--? -[voice] Oh, I know many things. I also know you've come here looking for something. -A file. -You don't have it. [voice] White. Marked: Top Secret. You give that back. It's not yours! [voice] Oh, isn't it? Ever hear of squatter's rights? Or maybe, finders keepers, losers weepers? [laughing] -Oh, but I am a good sport. -Hmm... -[voice] So let us play a little game. -Uh... [voice] I've hidden the file in the old control room. If you make it through my maze before time runs out, you can have what you came for. But if you don't, the file is mine. -And I can do with it as I please. -[whines] Mmm. Deal? Now, you wouldn't wanna disappoint your father, would you? Fine! [voice] Good. Then the time starts now! -Eh? -[voice laughing] Run, Juni! Run! [laughing] [tango music playing] Ugh! He cannot dance. He has too many left feet. He is unteachable. Me? It's your stealth suit. It's too slippery! We don't have time for this. We need someone who can teach Ace the Sardinian Tango. [Awesome wails] The Sardinian Tango! Uh, there is totes someone who can teach him. A specialist in all forms of ballroom dancing. But he's not gonna like who it is. Oh, no. Absolutely not! Wow, déjà vu. I will not teach him. Cadet Ace is a brute. He is incapable of understanding the nuances of the Sardinian Tango. [wails] The Sardinian Tango! Plus, I have no time. I must continue my search for a cat sitter for Lord Merriweather. But everyone I have asked appears to be too busy. Surprise, surprise. You know, Ms. Chatting-Botham, Ace was just mentioning to us today how much he would love to spend more time with Lord Merriweather. No, I wasn't! Agh! So, what if Ace agreed to cat-sit Lord Merriweather for you? Might you then find some time to teach him the Sardinian Tango? [Awesome] The Sardinian Tango! I will do it. Now, let me fetch my dancing shoes. In the meantime, Cadet Ace, you and Lord Merriweather can get better acquainted. -[laughs] -Oh, thank you, Ms. Chatting-Botham! -[cat purrs] -Ugh! -Where is the front of this thing? -[all gasp] -Oh! -[spurts] [panting] Gotta head toward the elevator. The control room is just across from it. [voice] Oh, look. Yet another dead end. Tick, tock, tick, tock. Time ticks away, Juni. -[laughing] -[grunts] [voice] Surprise! Dead end. [laughing] No! I'll never give up! [voice] Yes. But you've been at this for hours now. Your frustration is growing. I can hear it in your voice. Be quiet. [voice] Your first solo mission. A failure. Be quiet! [voice] Daddy probably should have sent your older sister. You're just a kid, Juni. I am not a kid! [grunts] [Carmen] Juni. Come in, Juni. [Juni] Uh-oh. [voice laughing] Oh... Speaking of big sis, there she is now. [Carmen] Are you okay? I heard something. [voice] And what do you think Carmen will say when I tell her that her baby bro is keeping secrets from her? That's not the game. We had a deal! [voice laughing] It's my game and it's my house, Juni. And I can change the rules as I please. -Adios, amigo. -[gasps] -[thumping] -[groans] [grunts] -Juni! Can you hear me? Juni! -[music playing] There you are. You ready? Yeah. Wasn't easy. But I learned everything I could. Cadets, we have now reached that special point in the evening, the traditional Headmaster's Dance. And Headmaster Immortata has chosen this year's dance to be... the Sardinian Tango. [Awesome sobbing] The Sardinian Tango! -This is it. -Our fate is resting on your feet. [applause] [gulps] [gasps] Whew. [music playing] Cadet Ace, may I have this dance? Hmm. -He's in. -OMG. Only one problemo. -He forgot to take the scanner. -[all gasp] [grunts] Hmm. Huh? -[voice] Well, well. He found his comm. -[groans] [voice] Minor victory. You'll never get to the control room in time. You're five levels below. Mission failed. The file is mine. [laughing] The elevator. [music continues] One, two, three, three, two, two, one, two... Dip! Whew! [chuckles, clicks tongue] [all groaning] Now to scan for the Pinnoquinox. Hmm? Crikey. I don't have the scanner. [Immortata gasps] Cadet Ace, what are you doing? [Immortata gasps] Whoa! [Immortata yelps] Cadet Ace, stop! Basta! [sighs] -Mind if I cut in? -Awesome, no. It's the-- Sardinian Tango. I am well aware. [claps] Olé! [music plays] [beeping] [cheering, applause] [whirring, beeps] Uh, negative. No trace of the serum. -What? Then how does she--? -I must find that apricot scrub. [cheering continues] [meowing, spurting] -[gasps] -[cadet] Awesome! Way to go! [voice] Mmm, yes. Been meaning to call a repairman about that. Remind me to put it on my list. [chortling] Yeah. Well, who needs an elevator when you have Bounder Boots? Going up! [voice] Wait! What are you doing? [yells] No! Now, there's one other little matter to take care of. Some pest control. [voice] You can't get rid of me, Juni. You can't even find me. You see, that's the thing. I don't need to find you. You said you liked games. Let's play a game. It's called, "Get out before the OSS blows up." [computer] Headquarters self-destruct engaged. -[alarm blaring] -[voice] What? All your memories. Everything will be destroyed. This is your home, Juni. No. You said it before. This place isn't my home. It's yours. And it's time to put the past behind me. I'm not the same little kid I used to be. I'm a superspy now. [voice] You fool! You've doomed us! Stop the self-destruct -and I will tell you everything! -No deal. [voice] Well, I guess you don't want to hear the truth about Sebastian Oliver? The OSS shadow operative that created the Pinnoquinox. I already know the truth. You gave yourself away earlier when you said you were "no one." Agent No-One. You're Sebastian Oliver. You're the one trying to get the serum for Golden Brain. [voice laughing] Golden Brain? I know nothing about that. But I do know that the truth you are looking for is in your hands, Juni Cortez. Wait? What do you mean? Wait! -Whoever you are, come back. -[voice laughing] -[computer] Self-destruct, begin. -[gasps] [yells] Ugh! [coughing] What did he mean, the truth was in my hands? Oh, no! Sebastian Oliver is... Dad? Junito, I am impressed you recovered the file so quickly. Uh, did everything go okay? Just had a little pest problem, but I took care of it. Oh, Juni, your first solo mission. I am so proud of you. I have to get back. Carmen is probably getting suspicious. -[Awesome chuckles] -[Glitch exclaims, laughs] Hey, you're back. Faculty turned out to be a dead end. The B-Team's next. What about you? Find anything interesting on your secret mission? Nope. Dead end, too. Hey, don't worry. I'm bummed, too. But we'll find out who the mole is. We're getting close. Mm-hmm. We're getting close. [sighs]
