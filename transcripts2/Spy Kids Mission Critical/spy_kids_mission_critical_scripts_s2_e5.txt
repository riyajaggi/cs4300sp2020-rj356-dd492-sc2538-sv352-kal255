 I know the mole's got everyone on edge, and these last few days have been tough on all of us. I should say so. I've had to switch to herbal. [slurps] Gah! But until we figure out who is working for Golden Brain, Mission Critical will remain on high alert. -I'm watching you. -Back at ya, mole. -[grunts] -Huh? [sighs] We aren't going to get anywhere acting all paranoid and pointing fingers at each other.

 Question, was it paranoid when you scanned my bunk for transmitters and bugs last night? I was being thorough, Scorpion. I scanned everyone's bunks. -You didn't scan mine. -I'm getting to it, Glitch. For the record, she did not find anything, except maybe what she already planted there to cover her own tracks. Hey. Are you calling me--? Well, if it looks like mole... -[sniffs] -Huh? ...and smells like mole, it is mole. -[growls] -Scorpion, Carmen's not the mole. Ace just wants you to think she is to cover his own tracks. -Ha! Spoken like a true mole. -[Awesome] Um... Might I interject before someone gets around to accusing me?

 [all] Hmm? With a mole in our presence, and no one knowing who it is... [Juni] Oh, I know who it is. ...who can we trust among us to hold on to the Pinnoquinox Serum? -Awesome's right. Juni, the serum. -Right. Huh. Oh, yeah. Hmm. -[toys clattering] -[Awesome] Hmm. Huh. Not there? -What? Where is serum? [grunts] -Yeah, where is serum? Oh, yeah, the blackout. The Never-ending Pocket. [music blaring] [music stops] -[Glitch] Huh? -[Juni] Aha! Ha! You mean you've been flying around with it all this time? Huh. I guess I have. [all] Humph. What? I will take it. Clearly, you are not responsible enough to have it. -Nuh-uh. Not if I can help it. -[groans] [all arguing] -OMG. This is getting us nowhere. -[beeping] [alarm blaring] [gasps] What was that? Sorry. I had to hack the alarm. It was the only way to shut you up. Okay. As far as I see it, we've only got one choice. Electroshock Ace -until he reveals his true identity. -[Carmen] No. We pick a hiding place as a team. That way, if it goes missing, we are all suspects. It's only fair. [all] Humph. [both growling] [Golden Brain] Ah. It will be a shame to cover up such a magnificently perfect brain with a superhuman android body. -But the things I do for world domination. -[monitor beeps] -[keyboard beeps] -Yes, Agent No-One. Talk to me. Agent No-One? [beeping] Oh, a coded message. How do I...? Too bad I turned the IT guy into pure energy. I could really use some help here. I should probably sign up for a class or something. What? "My presence has been detected. Serum on the move. We must discuss"? "Detected"? And what does that mean, "on the move"? Oh, it better be moving into my hands. Agh! I must have that serum! -Now, how do I compose an e-mail? -[beeps] [music playing] "Therese's Workout Mix"? [screams] No! -[bangs] -[grunts] [screams] Argh! How about one of the ventilation shafts? We put a tracer on it and let it just tumble around in there. I suppose you would be one to track it. Convenient. -You have a better suggestion, Scorpion? -[Scorpion] Yes. Maintenance trench under hangar bay. We have vehicles parked on top. It would be perfect. -[Awesome] Yes. Quite right. -[Juni] Great idea. Yeah, perfect for you to grab it before jetting off to one of your "fashion shows." Tell me, what size do you wear in SWAMP gear? I told you, I am not mole. Huh. I'll be the judge of that. Is this what we're like? You wish you were half as scary as them, mate. [Scorpion] You are blaming me about being mole. What the--? Sir Awesome. [beeps] What are you...? [girls gasp] -[bangs] -Ha! Two points. Fine. It's hidden. But we're not done. I am not mole. Why don't you question one of them for a change? You never really trusted me since I arrive at Academy. -Looks like my instincts were right. -[gasps] You did just show up out of nowhere, after all. How could you? I told you I had fashion shoot in Prague. "I had a fashion shoot in Prague"! -SWAMP transmission intercepted. -What's it say? This is a tough code. It keeps re-scrambling itself, but... -[beeps] -ZO-M-G! It's from Golden Brain. To the mole. -[others gasp] -Are you sure? I can't decode it a hundred percent, but I think Golden Brain wants to meet. -Face to face? -Affirmative. The only way in or out of the Academy is through the Taco Butte. Which means we need eyes on it, 24/7. -If we can catch the mole making his... -Or her. ...exit, then Golden Brain loses his inside man... -Or woman. -...for good. I will do it. Oh, no, no, no. No, you don't. Let me prove that I am not mole. Give me assignment. And if you are mole, I'll have handed you the keys to the kingdom. I'm going. Oh, I am sorry. Have we established that you are not mole? [both gasp] [gasps] Huh. [growls] So, if you do not have better idea, I have stakeout mission. Huh? Hmm. -[moans] -[growls] You know, I do have a better idea. -You do? -Yes, I do. Because the only thing better than a deep-cover spy in the Taco Butte is two deep-cover spies in the Taco Butte. -[Scorpion groans] -Now, we can stake out the exit, together. [Scorpion groans] -Hmm? Sorry. -Were you hoping I'd jump? -Possibly. -Do I make you nervous? -No. But you will definitely blow my cover if you keep this up. We must not raise suspicions. Right. Well, don't mind me, then. I'm just keeping an eye out for any SWAMP agents in disguise. -[Scorpion groans] -Hi. Can I get a large Hasta la Pasta Bowl, please? Whoa. A Hasta la Pasta Bowl, huh? And what is that code for, exactly? For a Hasta la Pasta Bowl, I think. Oh. Yeah, right. One Hasta la Pasta Bowl coming up. -[chuckles] -My apologies. She dropped a tub of guacamole on her head this morning. Oh, that explains a lot. Hey. Trainee. First day on the job. Trainee? I'm not a trainee. Uh, your nametag says "trainee." What? How did you... -"Assistant manager"? -[laughs] Yes. And careful, trainee, or your first day will be your last day. [growls] Now, why don't you head into the back and mop up? You are not the boss of-- -Shall I get someone to cover for you? -Huh? [crickets chirping] [sneers] Yes, ma'am. Oh, good help is so hard to find these days. [chuckles] Stupid Scorpion. Worst assistant manager ever. Eh? [Scorpion] Uh-huh. Huh? [gasps] [yelps] Focus up, Carmen. -[rings] -[yelps] Good afternoon. Taco Butte, where every day is truly Butte-e-ful. [Juni] Hola, Taco Butte employee! Could I get a beef Mexi-Smash with a side of mole sauce, please? What do you want, Juni? How did you know it was me? I was just checking in. How are things going? No mole sighting yet, unless my suspicions are correct. -What did you say? -Nothing. What are you up to? Glitch is going through the rest of that intercepted transmission, but no luck decrypting any more of it. Okay, keep me posted? Tango, signing off. I mean, thank you for calling Taco Butte. Have a Butte-e-ful day. Seriously though, can I get a Mexi-Smash? Hmm. I did a fashion shoot... [growls] -Any luck with the encryption? -[Glitch] Nada, Aztec. Huh. What you got there? Cheeseburger from the cafeteria. But they ran out of pickles. -[gasps] -What's wrong with pickles? Don't trust 'em, mate. They're just cucumbers gone bad. [whimpers] Huh. Gablet, full Academy scan, please. [gasps] Got something. "Twenty-five super cute ways to wear your hair this summer"? [Gablet] Oh, and I also have this, I guess. [beeping] It's the mole. They're transmitting again. -Are they still inside the Academy? -[beeping] [Glitch] Totes. But the signal's bouncing all over the place. Let's get moving. We need to track down the point of origin before it's too late. Assistant manager... Mopping done. Huh? Carmen? Oh, no. [squeals] What are you doing here? Do you work here? Why are you so sweaty? It's so good to see you. Uh, Lola, hi. So good to see you, too. It's been... Eight months and 12 days. I heard you transferred schools. This is so crazy. I just stopped in to get some AC while I wait for my mom to pick me up and here you are. Can you believe it? Honestly, no. I can't believe it. Just my luck. [Scorpion] Aren't you going to introduce me? Oh, um, sure. This is my old friend, Lola. Lola, this is... Gertrude. Yes, I am Gertrude, Carmen's boss. Carmen, tell me everything. How have you been? Do they sell tacos here? I have to use the bathroom. She seems nice. Oh, real slick, sticking me in the back to mop while you roam around as free as a mole out here. Okay, even I know that is not a saying. Yeah? Well, it is for me. Well, while you were pouting over spilled sour cream, I had the time to finally execute mission. I cased Taco Butte for suspicious persons. So far, everyone checks out. Not everyone. You must stop with the silly accusations. I am not mole. Now let me continue work. Not without me, you won't. Of course you can go on break now, Carmen. -Break? What break? -[Lola] Ooh! You're going on a break? We have so much to catch up about. Hey, did you change your hair? I don't love it. Let's talk. Talk to me, Glitch. Where are we going? Take a left at the next junction. Four doors down, on your left. Ha! Gotcha! -[all groan] [Glitch] You guys, the mole moved again. They must be moving the signal through multiple sources to throw me off. [Juni] What the--? And they may be using multiple signals to mask the real one. [sighs] Annoyed emoji. We need to split up. Uh! Ooh! Oh, crikey! Oof! Sorry, Ms. Chatting-Botham. I know that isn't language befitting of a gentleman. Humph! [purring] -[spurts] -[gags] Oh! You are not making this easy on the gentlemanly language, mate. Aha! Wait. [gasps] This is my room. [gasps] Am I the mole? [panting] I have you now, mole. [grunts] [Awesome moans] Little help, if you wouldn't mind. [chuckles] [Awesome groans] [Juni] Glitch, that's three big, fat nothings. What now? [Glitch] Whoa, it's on the move again. It's headed for the other side of the Academy. To the vents where you hid the serum. Concerned emoji. Yes, as the assistant manager of a Taco Butte, your responsibilities, they're very high. I mean, do I work hard? -Yes, I work very hard. -Um... But it's all for the tacos. It's all for the delicious food for everyone. What is she up to? -How's the chicken bombito? -Hmm? What? I said, how's the chicken bombito? Are you even listening? Never mind. I'm allergic to chicken. How's the steak taco-chada? [gasps] Are you dating anyone? Can I get a cheese quesadilla, but without cheese? Like, can I get Tex, but no Mex? [sighs] Lola, it's all good. Just pick something. Um... ...mmm... [growls] Okay, got it. Could I get a beef bombito on a blue corn tortilla, but without the sour cream, and the pico de gallo on the side. And could you maybe add extra guacamole, but only on the ends of the burrito? Also, I want carnitas instead of beef. But I want all this stuff in the beef bombito, not the carnitas bombito. And a medium lemonade. One-third ice. Okay, that's gonna take a minute or two. I'll be right back. I better come with you. These places always mess up my order. No offense, but it's like, I actually need extra gluten. -Better make sure kitchen's up to code. -Lola, no! But... Something's off about this room. I'm getting a weird vibe. Are you getting a weird vibe? Lola! Agh! Is that a walk-in freezer? I've never been in one before. I've always wanted to. Had an opportunity once, but my ride left without me. Let's go over here. I'll show you how we make a taco-chada. Hey, what's this? -Is this yours? -No. It says "property of Carmen Cortez" right on it. I've actually never seen a skateboard like this before. Where are the wheels? -Lola, give that to-- -[whirring] Whoa! Carmen, what is this thing? Are you not telling me something? Uh... [rattles] Hmm. [grunts] See anything? Huh? No. It's been stolen. Are you sure? Maybe it's just missing. It's a vial. It can't just go on walkabout. -The mole took it. -[Juni moans] Not exactly. [Ace] The serum? -Junior, you're the mole? -Diabolical. O-M-G. [Ace] Let's take this traitor to Vida. No. I never tossed it in the vent to begin with. Just a little sleight of hand. We trusted you, Junior. Hashtag, not cool, Aztec. Well, I couldn't trust any of you. Carmen was right. Who knows which one of us has been turned? I couldn't take that chance. -[Gablet beeping] -The mole's signal. It's headed right for us. Mission Critical, positions. -[grunts] -[beeps] [signal beeping] [Glitch gasps] [signal beeping] [Tom] Hmm? -[sighs] Oh, it's just Tom. -[boys] Get him! -[Tom] Hmm? -[boys grunting] [boys, Tom grunting] Ha! [Awesome] Uh, gentlemen... -[Tom grunts] -Sorry, Tom. But look at this. A portable transmission jammer? Oh! We got p'wned, you guys. This jammer's been masking the real signal this whole time. As long as it's running, the mole can throw us off the scent. Huh? [Juni grunts] Problem solved. [Gablet] Scanning, scanning... -Got it. The real signal. -Where is it? [whimpers] Something's up. I just know it. Since when do you work at a taco place? Scorpion? And what's up with this crazy thing? Did you really transfer schools? Who are you, really? Is your name really Carmen? Listen, Lola. I'll tell you the truth. Hmm! But you have to promise-- [Scorpion] Cortez! Do we pay you to gab with your friends? Uh, no. That is right, we do not. This is why you have been here six months, and you are still trainee. You cannot even mix a decent guacamole. Now stop showing off your silly toy, and get back to work. And you... [stammers] M-m-me? Your mother has been waiting out front for ten minutes. And this area is for employees only. I'm so sorry, Gertrude. Nice to see you, Carmen. You too, Lola. [sighs] Thank you for eating at Taco Butte. Have a Butte-e-ful day. You just saved my butt. Why? -[comm buzzes] -[Glitch] Tango, Scorpion. The mole is on the move. They've already left the Academy. But no one came up the elevator. [tires screech] -Missed them. -Not yet, we haven't. [tires screech] [tires screech] [tires screech] [Juni] Identical. Which one is it? I don't know. Everyone, take a car. On it. Me and Scorpion will take the lead one. [tires screech] [beeping] It's a decoy. Mine's fake, too. Oh, hashtag, another decoy. Same here. [both grunt] Another decoy? -All decoys. -The mole gave us the slip again. [Carmen] Everyone, back to Taco Butte. [Golden Brain] So, did it work? [No-One, distorted] Yes. They fell for the signal trick. I got them out of the Academy as I'd hoped. [Golden Brain] Excellent. Oh, I like where this is headed. [No-One] But... [Golden Brain] Now I don't like it as much. The serum wasn't where they hid it. They've moved it, and this time, I don't know where. [Golden Brain grunts] [upbeat music playing] [groans] Not Therese's Workout Mix! [groans] -[PSI] Are you the mole? -No. -Are you... married to an octopus? -Hmm? No. -[rings] -That's the last one. All of Mission Critical checks out. Boom! See? I passed test. I am not mole. [Carmen] No, you already passed. If anyone failed, it was me. The mole used my old feelings of distrust against me. If I had just trusted you, I wouldn't have almost gotten exposed by Lola. Thanks. Mm-hmm. And I'm sorry, too, mate. You're definitely not the mole. -This mole is way too crafty to be you. -[moans] -Same to you, Ace. Same to you. -Hmm? -Agh! Evil cucumber! -[laughing] Well, if none of us are the mole, that means we have to trust each other. But we can't trust anyone else. Right. Mission Critical may be in the clear, but that means the rest of the Academy still isn't. The Pinnoquinox is not safe. We must move it. But where? We need someplace that is guaranteed mole-proof. Ah! [Juni] No one knows this place exists but us. The serum will be safe here. Let's see the mole try to steal it now.
