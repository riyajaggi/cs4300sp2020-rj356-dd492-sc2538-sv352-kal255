 -[Immortata] Juni! Carmen! -[PSI] Whoa! [Immortata] Juni, Carmen! [Tom groans] Where are those Cortezes? -Never around when I want them lately. -[Dez whispering] [Awesome] As you see, I have been putting together a rather detailed list of mole suspects. And through careful examination and deductive reasoning, I have come to the conclusion that the mole is none other than... Me? No. Wait, but that's not right.

 This one was supposed to connect to string J, which... [gasps] [Awesome grunting] [groans, grunts] [gasps, thuds] [sighs] Not quite the debut of my new flight suit I was hoping for. But meet my new Flight Suit of Awesome. Ta-da! [gasps, groans] You should have PSI take a look at that triggering mechanism. I was gonna ask him to help install laser trip wires down here so we'll know if anyone tries to break in. No need, Junior. Thanks to my hypersonic hearing, I can hear enemy footsteps from miles away. Hypersonic hearing? Really?

 Shh. Mate, do you hear that? They just fried a Beef Bombito at the Taco Butte. No. A Chicken Bombito. Ugh! So, fearless coleader, do you have any new ideas for catching unfriendly academy rodent? Or is idea to hide down here, collecting dust like old encyclopedias? [blows] [coughs, growls] Oh, I did not see you there. [grunts] Sure. I've been working on a plan. Really? What is it? Yeah, well... What have you been working on, Scorpion? Booby trapping books. [Carmen gasps] -So? -[growls] Well, Gablet and I have been spending our time tracking recent mole chatter. [giggles] Yeah. And check this. Golden Brain has a bunch of secret satellites he's been using to communicate with the mole. Taking those out would seriously crash their super villain party. See? There's my plan. We'll take out those satellites and cut off the mole's means of communication. [Scorpion scoffs] Okay, Mission Critical, gear up! It's time for operation Holy Mole-y. [beeping] [horn blares] Ha! That should slow down the mole. Uh, but we should probably pick up our pace a little. [grunts] [grunts] Huh? Is that...? -[zaps] -[gasps] -[horn blares] -[gasps] [gasps] -Whoa! Nice shot, Carm. -Hmm. Yeah, right. [Scorpion and Glitch grunting] -[soldiers grunting] -Carm, one of us needs to get up there while the rest of us hold off these Swampies. No worries, comrades. Sir Awesome is on the case. The Flight Suit of Awesome is raring to go! No, Awesome! Just use your... jet pack. Uh, that's not good. -[all grunting] -[Juni] Whoa! [grunts] Uh... [can hissing] -[clanging] -[soldiers grunting] [soldiers grunting, groaning] [explosion] [Awesome grunts] Did I miss something? [groaning continues] -[lasers zapping] -[soldiers grunting] Okay, Mission Critical, we need another way to that final communication dish. [Awesome] Mm-hmm. Okay, now's the time you usually show up to rescue us. [soldiers grunting] Right? -[soldiers grunt] -Come on, get your head in the game. He's here. [soldiers grunting] Nuh-uh, you won't disappear on me this time. [soldiers grunting] Where is she going? Uh, to find another way to the communication dish? I hope. [soldiers grunt] [Carmen] Improv! I was right. OMG. Nice job, Tango. Hashtag, mole whacked. [Carmen] He's gone. Maybe not gone, but it will definitely be harder for the mole to get messages through to old Gold Dome now. -Great work, Carmen. -Hmm. Carmen? [echoes] -Carmen! -Huh? You okay? You've been flying without saying a word for hours. I did not mind it. Uh, what? Me? Yeah, fine. Okay. It's just that you've been acting even weirder than usual. Is something wrong? It's Agent Improv, Juni. He's been following us. Helping us. Ugh! That again? You never found any proof that he's even still active. No. This time I'm sure of it. I saw him. He's been at the last three missions. I think he's trying to contact me. Yes, it is official. She is cuckoo bananas. -[Carmen growls] -[Juni] Really? Well, if he's following us, then where is he now? [Carmen growls] I know what I saw. He was there. -What you think you s-- -[beeping] -Huh? -[Juni] Huh? What is that? [beeping continues] [Ace and Glitch exclaim] PSI, please tell her again that this is a terrible idea. -[growls] -Not to mention, completely reckless. Like I said, statistically speaking, opening unknown files from questionable sources is one of the worst things you could possibly do. And I told you, never tell me the odds. Carmen! [monitor beeping] Marvelous. You just gave entire academy virus. Hope you are happy. Mm, I don't think so. Look at all the missing lines of code. It appears to be just one-half a program. -But, where's the other half? -[Scorpion] Hmm. Looks like someone is playing joke on you, Tango. No one would dare play Scorpion like this. [beeping] Huh? -Touch me and loose limb. -[gasps] -[beeping continues] -Fair enough. [Scorpion grunting] Well, it looks like someone did play Scorpion like this, after all. -And that someone was Improv. -Humph! Carmen, maybe we should... [monitor beeping] -[Juni] What is it? -[Glitch] Looks like map coordinates. And a time? It probably means Improv wants to meet at that location, at that time. See? This proves he was trying to contact me. Uh... us. We have to meet with him. No, we don't. Carm, this could be just another mole distraction -to get us out of the academy. -[sighs] They know your weakness. Or since Improv worked for SWAMP, it could be some important inside information he's stolen for us. Or since Improv worked for SWAMP, he could be setting us up. Wait, when did I become the logical one? There's no time to waste. The rendezvous is happening. Uh, did she just...? [all] Mm-hmm. Ugh. [scanner beeping] [growls, sighs] Still nothing. [Juni] Because he isn't coming. What's gotten into you, Carm? Can we please go back to the academy now? We've been chasing you for hours. Let's just settle down and think this through. Shh! I hear something. Oh. Now this one is starting with this hypersonic hearing. You don't have it. No, Ace is totes right. Look! SWAMP! Thanks a lot, Improv. Mission Critical, time to split. Carmen, we have to go. No, you go. I'm gonna look for Improv. I think he's in trouble. What? Your boyfriend just set us up! No. Golden Brain must have found out about the meeting and grabbed him. Huh? Where did you get that from? Nowhere. Just a hunch. A hunch? Since when are you all about hunches? -[wind blowing] -[both grunt] [Gablet] Um, you guys, my Gabbler 10,000 Radar totally says sandstorm. [Glitch] OMG! Sandstorm. We need to go now! Fine. I need to find us a route out of here, pronto! Oh, let me help. No, not now. Not the... Ooh! [gasps] Oh, dear. [screams] -...Flight Suit of Awesome. -[Awesome continues screaming] -[engine sputtering] -Huh. The sand busted our jet packs. They're useless. [gasping, grunting] Awesome, grappling hook! [Juni grunting] Reel him in, guys. [Awesome screams] [thuds] -[Juni grunts] -[horn blares] -[gasps] -[crashing] [soldiers chanting] Hup, hup, hup, hup. [Awesome grunts] What do you say we cool it on the Flight Suit of Awesome for a while? [grunts] Capital idea. Oh, I can't see hand in front of face. And Gablet's Gabbler 10,000 Radar says this won't let up till morning. Then we've got to find shelter for the night. There! Okay, team, we hold up here for the night and then head back to the academy in the morning. All of us. What has gotten into you? You're acting all... [growls] Fine! Good! Yes. Well, nighty-night, then? [both huff] Hmm. [yawns] [yawns] Huh? Ace! Awesome! [gasps, grunts] [groans, gasps] Hey, the girls are gone. Your hypersonic hearing -couldn't have heard that. -Uh... They must have followed Carmen to look for Improv. Ugh! I can't believe her! Of all the irresponsible, reckless, harebrained... Who acts like that? -[Ace] Uh... -[both] Hmm... Oh, right. So this is what it's like living with me, huh? Okay. Well, if she's gonna act like me, then she's gonna need someone to think like her. Why are walls moving and making squishy sounds? [Gablet] According to my Gabletpedia, this is a glowworm cave. Glowworms are the female larvae of the click beetle. Yuck. Ugh! Dislike button. So tell me again, why we go in spooky cave, Tango? I told you, those Swampies were heading for shelter. So this is where they must also be holding Improv captive. [all grunt] [Carmen] Hmm... Tango, where are you going? To find Improv. You can't just go down tunnel all nilly-willy. Aren't you going to analyze options first? -Like always? -Yeah. But I know Improv is down there. -[both] How? -I have a hunch. What is this hunch? Always with hunch now. That's all I've been hearing since we snuck away. "Trust me, I have hunch." "Hunch is this way." "Go in spooky, trippy cave, Scorpion." It is hunch, hunch, hunch, hunch. I do not like hunch. [both growl] [grunts] Let go, Scorpion! Stop with the cuckoo bananas. We are going back. No more hunch. -[whirs] -[Scorpion] Huh? -[gasps] -[Glitch gasps] [screams] [all grunting] Now look what you have done. If we just followed my-- Do not say hunch! [grunting continues] Just because it's Improv, she thinks she can just run off and act all crazy. She has no proof. None! And he set us up. But she still sneaks off. Impulsive, unacceptable, reckless. That's not how a team leader acts. -Are you seeing this? -Oh, I'm seeing it, mate. But I ain't totally believing it. -Guys, over here! -Huh? Dark, scary, probably very dangerous. Absolutely no reason to go in there. Agreed. Definitely the kind of place I would go. Carmen's in there. -Well, he would know, wouldn't he? -Yeah. Ugh. I think some of these glow buggies have started a nest in my hair. [gasps] [soldier] Hey. Who's down there? Shh. Someone's coming. We have to get out of here. Scorpion, can you use your scorpion sting gauntlets to cut us loose? -No, hands are trapped. -Glitch? [grunting] Negative for me, too, Tango. [grunting continues] Spy Kids? Oh, Spy Kids. [chuckles] Wait until Golden Brain finds out about this. No more zaps with the Brain Cane -for Frankie. -[laser charging] [grunts] [groaning] Juni? How did you find us? I just thought of every bad decision I would make and... Carm, what's going on with you? She has hunch. I hate this word, by the way. I can't believe you ditched us and nearly got everyone captured. Improv is here, Juni. SWAMP has him. Carmen, Improv set us up. And we need to get out of here before we walk into another trap. Shush. Junior, do you hear that? Ace, for the last time, you don't have hypersonic hearing. Actually, according to my sound amplification phone, something is coming from down that path. [Golden Brain] Well, well, well. Taking out my weapon depots, sabotaging my satellite network, and now attempting to destroy my precious metal mine. You have been very busy, Agent Improv. -[Improv grunting] -[Golden Brain laughing] -I was right. -I was right. They were right? Improv is here, Juni. And Golden Brain has him. [Golden Brain] Oh, Improv, we could have been so good together. So much talent, so much promise. Oh, what a waste. You really could have made a fantastic SWAMP villain. And I meant to tell you how much I like the costume, by the way. The purple piping was a smart choice. Snazzy. [growls] [Golden Brain] But alas, I must dispose of you. But how? Bees? No. Squirrels? Been there. Earwax? Oh, is there a thing we can do with earwax? How many cotton swabs do we have on hand? [soldier] Uh... You'll never get away with this, Golden Brain. [Golden Brain laughs] Oh, but I will. And with the haul from this mine, and the many others I have, I am one step closer to achieving my ultimate goal. -Not if I can help it. -[Golden Brain laughs] Improv, you can't even help yourself. [Therese] Mr. Brain. -[Golden Brain gasps] -[soldiers] What? -What's, uh, going on? -[Golden Brain] Shh! Cut the hero-villain banter for a second. -But... But I don't-- -[Golden Brain] Shh! Ah, Therese. How goes the mining? [chuckles] [clears throat] Oh, Mr. Brain, how could you? [Golden Brain] Now, Therese, let me explain. -You better. -[Golden Brain] Yes. Um... Because I want to know how could you... get Klaus Kepler, the preeminent glowworm expert in the Northern Hemisphere here without me knowing about it? What a surprise! Oh, Dr. Kepler, it is an honor, sir. I have read all your books. -But, uh, I'm not-- -[chuckles] So modest. Oh, look, you even glow like they do. Rad! The purple piping is a smart choice. Snazzy. Oh, Mr. Brain, this is such a wonderful surprise, and it's not even my birthday. By the way, why is he up on the wall like that? -[Golden Brain] Oh, dolphin net injury. -Oh. You should totally try the Isochamber when it's ready. -What? -Well, I'm sorry to interrupt. I gotta get back to the grind. Hope your back feels better. Keep up the good work. These little glowing guys need us. Oh! [Golden Brain] Phew! Her blueberry muffins are fantastic. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. I was about to burst out into intimidating maniacal laughter. Three, two, one. [cackling] -[cackling echoes] -[gasps] -[Therese humming] -[all gasp] Huh? -[worm squelching] -Aw! [squeals] [all sigh] We've got to do something. Right. Let's make a plan. We don't have time for a plan. Well, we can't just rush in screaming and flailing, Carm. Well, we can't just sit here and watch, Juni. Uh, what is happening here? She is saying his words with her mouth... and he is saying her words with his mouth? Well, I've got a plan. Hear me out. You have ten seconds to explain, then I'm going in. That's exactly what I would've said. [Golden Brain] Not that I don't think it's great, but... where would we find kumquat in this climate? [screaming] [Golden Brain] Ugh, what is this about? -[Juni] Now! -[laser zaps] -[Scorpion grunts] -[Juni grunts] Awesome, the Flight Suit of Awesome. Engage! Mm-hmm. Ta-da! Take this! And that! [Golden Brain] Someone do something. Anything! -Thanks. -[sighs] -[soldiers] Hup. -Huh? Juni, now would be a really good time to share your exit plan. Uh... Hup, hup, hup, hup. You didn't make an exit plan? Cut me some slack. I'm new at this planning thing. You wouldn't happen to have a smoke bomb handy, would you? Yes, and... -[can hissing] -[soldier] Where did they go? -Thanks for the rescue. -Anytime. Ugh! Oh, right. We got your message to meet you here. Yes, I had to talk face to face. I couldn't risk the mole intercepting my message. I know who the mole is. I knew it! -And it's-- Ah! -[laser zaps] Improv! [Golden Brain] Spy Kids! [Golden Brain gasps] Oh... Improv, are you okay? Improv? What's an Improv? What do you mean? You are. -I am? -Yes. You're Jason Peter Anthony. Agent Improv. And I need you to remember, who is the mole? Mole? What mole? Where? [rocks rumbling] [Golden Brain yells] We've gotta get out of here. There's too many of them. Grab Improv. Right. [all gasp] He's gone. [Juni] I'm sure we'll find him, Carm. And hopefully when we do, he'll remember who he is. Weird day, huh? Truthfully, I kinda liked being the levelheaded one for once. And I liked following my gut. Yeah, but let's not make a habit of it, okay? [both chuckling] [beeping]
