 Aristocrats (1999–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - Episode #1.5 - full transcript 
 Louisa tries to make things right acting as an intermediary between Sarah and the rest of the family. Their brother, the Duke of Richmond, offers Sarah a home and his protection but only on the condition that she leaves William Gordon never to see him again. Sarah agrees and lives a very austere life. She can dine with the family only if there are no visitors and can receive no friends. For her part, Sarah takes it all seriously and seems intent to reform herself, even after meeting a handsome army captain. Emily meanwhile takes an interest in her children's tutor, Mr. William Ogilvie and they begin an affair. Age begins to catch up with many of them. Henry Fox succumbs to old age and Lady Caroline follows him within a year. Fortunately, she and Emily had the opportunity to reconcile in that time. Emily's husband dies and she decides to marry Ogilvie. Her favorite son Edward marries and establishes himself in Ireland though he is something of a radical.

 Lt is proposed that you should undertake... ..the education of my children. You will live at my house by the sea. The world was beginning to turn... though we did not know it. There is no lover, l am certain. L do nothing but kiss. No-one objects to that. To think l have defended you when, all this time, you were... You are bad! L want to do what is right. This is between you and me.

 You knew she had a lover? - Lf we had been told, we would have come. - L will not be judged! Caroline, don't! We shall see what my brother has to say. - Why did you speak to His Grace? - You must make your choice. The Duke of Leinster or me? There is no choice. Ln rank and privilege lie the seeds of vexation and grief. Everyone thought l should marry the King. When it didn't take, you just wanted me married! - L didn't. - L could never be perfect like you. Come back to the family. Come back to us, Sarah.

 Ls that from Caroline? Sadly, no. Do you approve? As always. You are Queen of lreland. We shall be late. Being Queen of lreland occasionally allowed me to forget the rift between myself and Caroline. The lobsters did not arrive. There is duck, there are oysters, there is our excellent beef. - No mutton, no pork. - Of course there is mutton and pork. L fretted with Cook for an hour this morning. You ordered fires in every room? Lf l didn't, it is now too late. Everyone is here. - Even William's dancing improves. - Poor William. He tries to please. Did you read my story, Father? L'll take it to London, Edward. Lf l have time, l'll read it. You won't have time. Good evening. - Good evening. - Your Grace. About the captaincy for my nephew. - L am grateful. - L make no promise. L'll recommend. They exaggerate my power. L recommend appointments, London appoints. L press for policies, London decides. Lt would be better if all decisions were made in Dublin. L have long thought you too often away. - Magnificent evening, Your Grace. - Thank you. The finest house in the country. How you must enjoy it. Lt requires a deal of work. We are fortunate indeed to possess it. The pleasure of such possessions is ample reward. Ls there such pleasure in possession? L sometimes doubt it. L was beginning to yearn for a quieter life. My brood of children spent most of their time at our house by the sea. L visited them as often as l could. L felt l was stepping into another world where life was natural and free. Sufficient for dinner? A few more. Better too many than too few, huh? Come on. Under the tutelage of Mr Ogilvie, the children thrived in their rural education. L envied the comparative simplicity of their lives. Are there enough for me? Mama! Edward, my love. Mwah! Father didn't come. He is delayed in London again. - We have a fine crop, Your Grace. - And good workers, l hope. - Our house prospers. - Maybe l interrupt the work? No, your Grace. Lt's but a trifle. lt'll soon be done. Lf you wish to sit? Lord Henry draws every second day. L believe you will see an improvement. We make no boasts of Latin, but our French and English grows apace. Look, Mama, look. Edward! - Did you make it all yourself? - Mr Ogilvie helped me. Ah. L've found a fencing master that's willing to come. - Yes? - Once a week. At a reasonable rate. Do you wish to see him? L'll rely on you. Lt's a fine room. Yes. You will, of course, dress simply. Nothing fine or fancy. You must not attend gatherings where you will meet young men. Ln a few years, perhaps, you may re-enter society. L will have to learn to enjoy my own company. L'm not used to being alone. Alone? You have your child. How long will it last, do you suppose, this determination of Sarah's to reform? Why must she reform? She only did what everyone else does. Her offence was to be discovered doing it. Everyone does not... You do not disapprove of my flirtations. A little gallantry is necessary for a man. Ah, necessary for a man, but inexcusable in a woman. Then with whom can a man have an affair? She knew the world. L only wish she had taken my advice. Oh, Mother, you are still smarting because she did not marry the King. Lf she had, would you still be challenging the King's authority as you do? L support all reforms that check the powers of the Crown. Yes, l heard something of this sort in the House yesterday. You spread bad ideas, Mr Fox. L speak for Parliament, - which represents the people. - The people? The people don't know what they want. So Parliament must guide them. You should remember where your interests lie, Mr Fox. My son does not look to politics for personal advancement. Sarah. - You look well. - Not too well, l hope. Ls this not simple enough? No, no, l did not mean the dress. L meant your health. Do you sleep well? Yes, l sleep well. And how is baby Louisa? She begins to walk. So soon? She must be very clever. L think she is. She knows her red cup from her blue. L long to see her. - Do you stay here in the house? - We have given her some rooms. They are comfortable. Ah, Lord and Lady Marchmont are here. - Then l must leave. - But you've only just arrived. Ln London, Sarah was being kept from society. She seemed willing to reform. Then an old friend returned from America to remind her of more intemperate times. Someone to see you. Lady Susan! L've so hoped l would see you ever since l heard of your return. You look well. Very sober, l know. You must tell me all. There's nothing to tell. Let me hear about you. How's Mr O'Brien? As handsome as ever, thank God. And who do you meet now you're back? Everyone who will see me. We are inconvenient women, my dear. No-one knows how to treat us. Though they know well how we should behave. No doubt they are right. How is little Louisa? Oooh! She's charming! Like you. L can't be repentant for marrying an actor. But l must repent, l must. But you have no company here! What do you do? L read. How your mind will improve. You were very right in imagining that Lady Lucy would enjoy our haymaking. L wish you had been with us to see it. All the children remain busy and happy and beg me to send you a thousand kisses. May l interrupt? Louisa! L did not know you had returned. L returned yesterday. How is Sarah? She seems satisfied, l think. Oh, good. And... our brother? - He's well. - Good. Everyone is well. You look tired. L'm not tired. Just lazy. Oh, l have to do these in a week. Whatever l do, l never seem to finish. When l am here, l so miss the children. And... ..being by the sea. Are you fretting of late? L so miss Caroline. She still will not write. L sometimes feel that the situation is hopeless. When Louisa returned from London, l asked after Sarah and my brother. But l could not enquire after Caroline. Lf you've been close, the closeness never dies. L comfort myself with that thought. Oh, they seem so happy. L wish it could last. Their childhood happiness gives you reason for hope. You're right. We learn affection in childhood. Happiness is impossible without that. Low in the saddle! England was preparing for war with the colonies. Sarah found a new focus for her feelings. Avidly, she followed the progress of the conflict. My dear Sarah, the house is full of soldiers. My brother has permitted them to board. So many, so handsome. Such a pity they fight the colonists. You favour the American rebels? - Of course. - The Army is wrong? These men do their duty. L cannot blame them for that. L've just heard that Bunbury's divorced you. Yes. How does it feel to be free? Thank God l cannot go back to him. You didn't consider it? No. Louisa and my brother thought l should. Emily and Caroline thought l should not. How could Louisa? - L don't think l'd forgive her. - Well, she has always forgiven me. My dear, you've changed. Of course. L'm older. L do not claim happiness. L'm surprisingly cheerful most of the time. Are they yours? They keep me company. You're an early riser. So are you. She met an officer called George Napier, who seemed conscientious and upright, stolid rather than dashing. L've seen you at the house. L live there. Why haven't we met? L do not mix. L have it - you disapprove of soldiers. No. L admire them. Lt's a hard life. Not at the moment. When the drilling and marching is over, we are free. We're offered such entertainment, we grow quite soft. - You will be sorry to fight? - On the contrary, l welcome action. Lt is, after all, what l'm trained for. My wife will be sorry. She worries? She will miss the entertainment. The balls, the outings. L must hurry back. My daughter will be awake. Oh, you have a daughter? Yes. She's a great comfort. Sadly for Sarah, he was married. But then, so was l. And l, too, was wondering if marriage should be a hindrance to desire. - Do you think l favour Eddie? - He loves you so much, it's hard to avoid it. Mm. L hope the others will forgive me if l do. They find no fault in their mama. Lt's so quiet here. Are you a little tired, Your Grace? Would you like me to read to you? Thank you. The New Eloise. Such a sad story. L don't know why l like it so much. "How curious are the caprices of love, beautiful Julie. My heart has more than it hopes for and still it sighs. This urgent heart dares to keep desiring." We dine quietly this evening. Will you join us? Who will be there? A few officers... their wives. L need another for a table of whist. You've met George Napier. L do not remember. He says he's met you. L should have known who you were. The disgraceful Lady Sarah? Oh, l didn't mean that. You're my host's sister. Do tell me one more time... My brother has been kind to me. - So he should be. - My story is not edifying. He's your brother nevertheless. Most people make mistakes. Do you believe a person may lose their bad character? L don't judge on history. L take as l find. What made you decide to join the Army? My family have long served the Crown. L consider myself exceptionally fortunate. - l'm good at what l do. Ls that enough? Lt is. Lt is a most lasting satisfaction. Then l shall not pity you when l read of battles. There'll be so much to do and think, there'll be no time for discomfort or fear. Of course. - L'd not thought. - Afterwards, we shall count the cost. You may pity us then. L hate the loss of life. Lt may seem strange for a soldier, but so do l. Your wife tells me you enjoy billiards, Captain Napier. You'll join me in a game? Lndeed, Your Grace. Do you walk early every morning? The End. And now it's time for bed. Oh! Bed, now. Will you come up and see me asleep, Mr Papa? Lf you make haste, maybe l will. The sweetest hour of the day. Good for walking. Are you coming? Mr Ogilvie had become more than a tutor. He was a friend with whom l could share my continued tenderness towards my children. They called him Mr Papa. Lt was inevitable that the growing affection between us would become too powerful to resist. Mama! - L don't know what to do. - What? There should be 12 men working on the East Walk and only six have turned up. Well, you must hire more. They asked for more money. Should l pay it? What would Father say? Your father is delayed in London. L wanted to ask him about planting flax. L can't discuss it now. There are 17 to dinner. By comparison with life in the company of Mr Ogilvie and the children, my duties in Dublin seemed onerous. L longed to escape, to forget. L thought love like this was only for the young. Happy? France supports the colonists. Lt will drag out. Do you think your regiment might be moved? There's no word of it. Lt will be quieter without you. We will quickly be forgotten. People will regret the entertainment. L will regret... Going into action, Captain Napier? What will you regret? L will regret you. You mustn't. L've fallen in love with you. L'm sorry. Lt does no good. Your Grace. Captain Napier. You should not be here. Your brother has spoken to me. He has observed the... ..feeling between us... ..and believes you are persuadable. Did he condemn my conduct? There is nothing to condemn. What did he say? He insists l leave. L have transferred to the 80th Regiment. Lt sails for New York next month. May l call to say goodbye? Lt is better not. For the first time in her unhappy life, Sarah experienced true love. My own new love, though furtive, wasjoyous. For l was unaware that the future held sorrows. L learned from Louisa that Mr Fox was dying. How much this time? - 2,000. - Speak up. - 3,000. - Ln a single night? You promised so faithfully to stop. Can you pay so much? Lt's worth an estate. Of course they cannot pay. L don't know how they dare speak to us. They break our heart. L... l will pay. Get out! Get out! Get out! You must rest. L'll stay. How are you? Sleepy. You will improve. L weary somewhat of life. Don't. There is still much for you to enjoy. You'll still be next. L've had a good life. Haven't you? Yes. L have. Your sister... ..gave me love. She gave me grandchildren. And Charles James gives me success. He dominates Parliament. He... He will be... a great man. Like his father. He will be remembered... ..whilst l... Sleep now. You need it. L... ..hope you find... ..happiness, Sarah. Lt's what you deserve. Henry Fox slipped from life easily, as if shrugging off a weary burden. Caroline herself was now ailing. She became almost too ill to mourn him. And in lreland, l, too, had grave illness to contend with. Father! l've been waiting to ask you about planting... Send for the doctor. - Are you all right? - Go. Go! My dearest Jemmy. So much medicine for gout. Lt's dropsy, Your Grace. What? Will you excuse us? Jemmy? L'm dying, Emily. No. No, the doctors are wrong. They all agree. Jemmy! Why did you not tell me? You know it grieves me to see you sad. L'll try to be brave. L've given you this house for your lifetime. - And l've added to your income. - Sh! Don't weary yourself with this. L'm not in pain. - Oh... - All my life... ..l've wanted to give you what l can. Lt comforts me now in death. Oh, my dearest Jemmy... You have given me everything you could. Hundreds came to Jemmy's funeral to pay their last respects. Lt seemed to me all lreland mourned him. Ln my grief, l had the comfort of a longed-for reconciliation. L received a letter from Caroline. At last. Anything you need, happy to help. Are they here? They are coming. How is the pain? The laudanum helps. Quick, help me up. Lady Louisa Conolly and Her Grace, the Duchess of Leinster. Ah, Louisa! Caroline! Oh, at last. Oh! Dearest sis. - Caroline, l... - l should have written long ago. L didn't want... Well, the things l said... Shush. Shush! How is she? Sit there. Right there. L have often imagined you sitting there. Lmagined me as l was, much younger. No. As you are now. My best, beloved sister. L remember the day we were first all together. Lt was when Father had decided to forgive me for eloping. You, Sarah, were... ..oh, a little child. What was Father like? He embraced learning. He made sure we all did, too. And excelling. And collecting. He collected shells. l remember. Shells and... trees and art and animals. Oh, the raccoons. And that enormous lioness. He loved the lioness. When she died, he gave her a royal burial. Wolves and... ..and armadillos and... Oh, that chimpanzee. Such nightmares l had that the tiger would eat me. Yes. Was there such a thing as a truffle hog? The truffle hog died. Father said it had done it to annoy him. Annoying Father was an easy task. L did it without trying. Lt is as well that he did not know me. No. - Take it. - No! - Take it. lt will ease the pain. - No! No! Ls there nothing else you can do? There is no more. L know l grieved her. Have l caused this? L grieved her, too. L will get up tomorrow. And l will sit in a chair. L will have some comfort. There is comfort in God. - Would you like me to pray? - No. L will not... die. Caroline did not die content. She was unreconciled to death, to God. She met them head-on, only giving up her life when it was snatched from her. At least the family was once again united at the end. How long will you stay? L wish to return to my children. Mr Ogilvie takes care of them. He sounds like an exceptional man. L only wish l could meet him. L expect you will. I am going to marry him. Oh, my dear sister. You can't. He's a tutor. You'll marry him? But why? L love him. And l'm expecting his child. Oh, Emily. The scandal! What will people say? People will say that l am a fool. And worse than that, an old fool. They will talk me over and say what they please. Most will condemn me. Few will approve. But it will not matter because l shall be in France, with my children... ..and Mr Ogilvie. L'm sorry if l surprised you. You had to know. L was tired now and wished to travel as far as possible from the grief, the evasion, the disintegration of all we had known. Soon after Mr Fox and Caroline died, their oldest son Ste joined them. Their home became an empty place. All the objects she possessed. Only objects, damn it all. Oh, don't cry. The sum of her life. By no means. She didn't live for things. Her life was with him, not with things. - L have news from New York. - Yes? Everyone rejoices that they've taken Philadelphia. And a fever is raging in the 80th. - Do we know anyone affected? - Captain Napier and his wife. She died. He, however, did not. God rest her soul. Like all of us, Sarah craved the solace of a calm life. And, at last, she was close to achieving a happy one. She could not forget George Napier. She hoped that he would return from America with feelings as strong as those he had left with. She only had to overcome the resistance of our brother, the Duke. Sarah. You can't become an army wife. The man has nothing but his pay. Hundreds of people live pleasantly on small incomes. They have not been bred to such comforts as you. L can do without comfort. So you say, but you have not considered... Believe me, brother. L have had both time and leisure to consider all l need. You have a comfortable place to live, my protection, a refuge for your daughter. What else do you want? A life. A life with the rabble following the drum? Our soldiers hazard their lives for us. Do you think it is fair to call them rabble? You speak to her, Louisa. She'll listen to you. Lt was a time for acceptance and forgiveness within the family. Sarah... why do you suppose Captain Napier wants to marry you? For my character alone, which precisely suits his. Why do you wish to marry him? The life he lives is difficult. For the one thing l'm certain of. Yes? L love him. An army captain! lt does not make sense. L'm sorry to disagree. But l believe it does. What? Ls there any fault in his character? Not one that l know. Their knowledge of one another has been long. lt has lasted through difficulties and distance. Sarah, if you wish to marry him... ..l cannot object. L depended on you, Louisa! L thought you were wise. Perhaps overly wise on occasion, brother. L'm so glad you approve. - You would marry him, anyway. - L would. Sarah was finally blessed with the tranquillity and contentment she deserved. Her husband was a good man. Ln him, she found the fortitude and the love to be happy at last and in the years to come. We have new curtains. You approve? One would think you were born to be a soldier's wife. Tell Cook we are ready to eat. Charles! George! Lunch! George Napier was posted to lreland, where he and Sarah started a family. As the years passed, their sons grew up strong and healthy. We all grew much older. Pray be seated. We're invited to Castletown, my dear. Oh? Emily and Mr Ogilvie are invited, too. Lt seems Emily has a surprise for us. L came home from France with little thought of the great changes that would soon engulf us. My favourite son, Edward, had also returned, from America. - He has been living with lndians. - Lndians? - He fished with them, hunted with them. - With savages? He says they have none of our ridiculous wants. His view is that they have all the happiness of life. A view that you agree with, l suppose, Mr Ogilvie? Why, l've always said Edward would be happiest if he were a savage himself. Edward! Aunt Sarah. Captain Napier. Lord Edward. He has left the Army, Captain Napier. Really? - Why? - Not for any cowardly reasons, l'm sure. You're right, Mr Conolly. Lt was my conscience that made me leave. His heart... will always rule his head. The Americans have a right to their independence. Ln all conscience, l could no longer fight against them. But you liked the life of a soldier? L did. Your mother tells us you lived with lndians. With the lroquois, yes. Was it not dangerous, Edward, living among savages? They are the gentlest and noblest of people, Aunt Louisa. Lt was more dangerous being a soldier. But you have never feared danger, Edward? Lf the cause isjust, Mr Papa, l welcome it. Nothing worthwhile is won without a price.
