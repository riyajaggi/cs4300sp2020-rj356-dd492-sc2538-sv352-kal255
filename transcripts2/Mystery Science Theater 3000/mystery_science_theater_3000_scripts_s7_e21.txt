 Mystery Science Theater 3000 (1988–1999): Season 7, Episode 21 - The Beast of Yucca Flats - full transcript 
 Mike and the bots decide to try redecorating the SOL with new wallpaper, but it doesn't seem to match up. Meanwhile, the Mads declare the SOL is part of the Counter Culture and sends the movie as what they call Proposition: Deep 13, a political movement Mike is elected to repel until they lose hope at the news that it's another movie by Coleman Francis. During the movie, their quiet afternoon is interrupted by a trailer of space fairing partying college co-eds and Crow's obsession with his 11:30 lunch time begins to annoy Mike. After enduring so much of the movie, Crow establishes FAPS - the Film Anti-Preservation Society and urges every person everywhere to destroy bad movies wherever they might find it, a movement Mike is against for morale issues despite Crow's indifference. Upon the movie's completion, Mike and the bots emerge from the theater victorious having tamed the movie and Dr. Forrester copes with it by slapping Frank all through to the end of the credits.

 ♪ I should really just relax ♪ ♪ For Mystery Science Theater 3000 ♪ -No, no. The plumb. Mike, the plum. Mike, watch your plumb. Mike. -Yes, Servo, I know. -Uh, the pattern's not matched up, Mike. Hey, you know, the pattern's not matched up over there, either. -Thank you, Crow. Thank you very much. Hi, everyone, I'm Mike. And, uh, Crow and Servo here are helping me lots with my little wallpapering project. -That's right. I thought this would be a good way to give the place a little perk me up. [laughs] We were gonna go with the Christmas wallpaper. Then I put the kibosh on that. And it was very difficult to say no to the birthday wallpaper, but I absolutely fell in love with this. -Yes siree Bob, we made the right choice. We gotta show Gypsy. Should we show Gypsy? Hey, Gypsy! -Huh? Oh. Ooh. Oh, my God! Oh my, oh my, oh, wrong, wrong, wrong! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! -[laughing] Oh, well. Sometimes, a new look takes a little getting used to. -We'll be right back. -Yeah. -I think I still see a place where the pattern's not matched up, Mike. Although it is fun when we all pitch in like this, isn't it? -Oh! I think the bads are calling. -Really? -You know what I found out about you and your cute little friends, Nelson? You're part of the counterculture. That's right! You're the enemy of hard working guys like us. That's why today is a great day. For today, we rally in support of Proposition Deep 13. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Simply put, Proposition Deep 13 means that we will send you today's experiment, The Beast of Yucca Flats. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you. And it will crush the Satellite of Love, Nelson, because we've signed a contract with America. Tell them what we're sending them, Frank. -We're sending you a wake up call named The Beast of Yucca Flats. -Take that, counterculture. -You're out of touch, and we hate you. -Oh, you do, do you? Well, maybe we can't match your pomp and your balloons and your bunting. -Oh, hold on, I think I got a horn! -But what we do have here is this man, the nation's most articulate spokesman for the dream that is The Satellite of Love. This fearless man who has led us, his quaking sheep, through, lo, our darkest hours-- -Thank you. Thank you, Servo. -[making horn noises] -Need I describe how he stood with us before the goons and truncheons of Peabody Mining? A loyal friend to the unions! A-- -Get out of here. Thank you. Our-- -[making horn noises] -Thank you. Our message is a simple one. -[making horn noises] -Crow. Crow... For we have struggled, yet we have prevailed... -[making horn noises] -...through-- please. Thank you. Through the dark days of Outlaw-- -[making horn noises] -And-- and The Creeping Terror... [making horn noises] Hey! -...that we shall triumph, for we are somebody. -Yeah! -Oh, really? Even if I tell you that The Beast of Yucca Flats is another motion picture from Coleman Francis? -Well, I think we can survive. -We're doomed! -We have been forsaken. [crying] -I thought so. So without further delay, be prepared to be crushed by The Beast of Yucca-- -Actually, uh, there's a short first. -After the short, be prepared to be crushed by-- -Oh, uh, actually there's another short after that. -In about a half an hour. Would that work? Be prepared to be crushed by The Beast of Yucca Flats! -Come on. We can do it, guys. The dream will never die. -[crying] -[movie sign buzzer] -Oh, we got Movie Sign! -Oh, we got Movie Sign! [music playing] -[Crow and Servo crying] -[Mike] Oh, come on. It's gut check time. We can do it. -[Crow] And talks and talks. I can't get a word in edgewise. -[Servo] Ah, for high school students from 7 to 70. -[Mike] I'll bet high school students flocked to this movie in droves. -Produced by imps! -[Servo] Promoting dullardism throughout this great land of ours. [music playing] [Crow and Servo humming with music] -[Servo] Money is fun. -[laughter] -[Crow] When it's fun. -[Crow] OK, so we steal the money tonight. -[Servo] Ooh, he's had his chest excavated. -[Mike] Greasy scarecrow boy not invited. -Want to go to the dance with me? -[boy, voiceover] Well, here we go again. Why is it that I always run out of money just when I need it? -[Servo] Why do I caulk my hair? -[boy] Why am I always broke? -Maybe it's my crack habit. -[boy] Bob buys himself a car, while I have to worry about wearing a hat to take his sister to a dance. -[Crow] Maybe it's these mortgage payments. Should have bought a smaller house. -[boy] I don't get it. -[Servo] Ah, the appeal of Adam Sandler. -[boy] Other people don't seem to worry about money all the time. Why am I always in the red? -[Crow] Even having a huge Mallomar doesn't help. -[boy] $0.50. Half a dollar. -[Servo] In those days, that'd buy you a car. -[boy] Benjamin Franklin, eh? -Bite me, Franklin. -[boy] He was supposed to be a pretty smart fellow when it came to money. I suppose he could have told me how to keep out of the red. -He was the best president we ever had. -[boy] Aw, what's the use? -[Servo] Sorcerer! -[shivers] -[Mike] Why must I be a young Christopher Walken? -There's no place like a bank. There's no place like a bank. -[Servo] Alfred Hitchcock! -[man] William. William, my boy. -[Mike] Can you borrow me $1.00? -Who's that? -[man] Over here, son. -[Crow] Directly in front of you. -[Servo] Tom Bosley's come to haunt him. -Don't you recognize me? You were just looking at me on that half dollar. -[Mike] Just reach for the gun. -Are you Benjamin Franklin? -[Benjamin] That's right. Come over here, son. I'd like to talk to you. -Could you have your slave press my suit? -[Benjamin] That's right. Over here. -[Servo laughs] -Thank you, boy. Perhaps I can be of some help to you in removing you from what you so quaintly describe as "the red". -[Servo] For a price! -What do you mean? -Now, I don't think that your problem is a difficult one, William. You have one important thing to learn, and then you'll have no problem. You must learn how to manage your money. -What money? -[Servo] Don't smart-mouth me, boy. -You've a point there, son. You must have some money before you can manage it. But you do not fare badly on that score. -[Servo] You can sell your body! -I don't? -No. Let me show you. -[Crow] Will our mystery guest enter and sign in, please? -[Benjamin] Come on, boy. -[Mike] Jump on my stomach. -Come a little closer. Suppose you look in this mirror and see what it tells you. -[Mike] God, I'm fat. -[Benjamin] Now, take a good look at you and your earnings. -[Crow] I'm Kate Moss! -[Benjamin] You receive $2.00 every week as an allowance from your father. -[Mike] James Joyce. -[Benjamin] Something quite unheard of in my day. -Fathers? -[Benjamin] Then, you earn about $3.00 each week delivering for the pharmacy. -[Servo] Here's your sherry. -[Benjamin] In addition, you obtain another dollar or so in what you call "tips". -Or protection. -[Benjamin] You earn between $6.00 and $7.00 a week, William. -[Mike, Servo and Crow] Ooh. -A tidy sum for a boy who's still in school. -Maybe so, but I never have any money when I need it. -That's not because you're a poor earner, William. It's because you're a poor spender. -[Crow] And a bad person. -Poor spender? -Yes, my boy. You spend your money without any plan. You buy whenever the mood strikes you. -[Servo] Furs, cars, trips to Vegas. -[Benjamin] You spend your money as fast as you acquire it. -[Servo] Ugh. -[Benjamin] With no thought for the future. -[Servo] You idiot. -[Benjamin] Then, when something comes along where you need money, you do not have it. -On behalf of all girls, none of us are going to the dance with you. -I guess you're right. But what should I do about it? -[Servo] I don't know! -Whatever you want to do, my boy. The important thing is to want to do something. Now, judging from these drawings, -you'd like to be an architect someday. -[Servo] Forget it, soda jerk. -That's right. -Fine. Then let me ask you a question. Why should anyone pay an architect for house plans? Why shouldn't he just go right ahead and build it? -He wouldn't know what to do first. He wouldn't have a plan. -[Benjamin] Exactly. The plan is a guide. A means to an end. It enables a man to build the kind of house he wants for a price he can afford to pay. -[Servo] Ow, my gout! Oh. -And the same thing, William, holds true in handling money. -[Servo] I hate you. -You must decide what you want your money to do for you and then, plan your spending accordingly. You've heard this before. Plan your spending. -[Mike] Ding! -[William] Oh, that sounds all right if you have a lot of money to plan with. -[Servo] Listen, little toad. -Believe me, William, it's even more important if you do not have a great deal of money. -How come? -Because the less money you have, the more careful you must be with it. Did you ever hear of a budget, William? -Uh, that's a fish, right? -I sure did. Just last night. -[Servo] Whoa. I don't think I want to hear about this. -[man] I'm sorry, Bill. -[Mike] I'll have to break your legs. -You have to learn to manage your money. I can't let you go along thinking that money grows on trees. -But I only need another dollar and a half, Dad. -You'd have the money for that dance if you kept a budget. I have to keep one, you know. -[Servo] You talking to me? -[Benjamin] Your father was right, William. He has to keep a budget to be sure that all essential items are taken care of. -[Servo] Dope. -And it's the same for you. -Me? Oh, no. That budgeting business sounds too complicated. -But your budget needn't be complicated. You haven't as many things to consider as your father has. Here. This is the idea. -[Mike] Ding! -[Benjamin] A budget should fit the user. -Like a teddy. -[Benjamin] It is designed to fit the person who's using it. -[Mike] Jay Gatsby. -[Benjamin] Take the budget of your friend Bob, for instance. -[Servo] Bob's a better person than you are. -[Benjamin] He keeps a record of each expenditure. -Bob is anal. -[Benjamin] Then, all he has to do is look at his budget [audio skipping]-- exactly how he stands. -[Servo] Hm. -[Benjamin] Notice that last item on his budget, William? Savings? -[Servo] Get it, William? -How does he ever have that much left? -He doesn't have it "left", William. If Bob saved only what he had left, he would not have that car. -Huh? -He sets that aside first. -[Mike] Uh. -Boy, what willpower. -[Benjamin] No, it isn't just willpower. You see, Bob had a goal. -[Servo] And two assists! -He knew two years ago that he wanted a car when he finished high school, so he began saving for it. Each week, he went down to the bank... -[Crow] And robbed it! -...and deposited his savings regularly. And the extra money he made during vacations helped his bank account grow, too. Until one day, he had enough to buy the car he wanted. -[Mike] But then he crashed his car and died. -[Benjamin] Bob remembered one important rule. -[Servo] Stuffing instead of potatoes. -[Benjamin] Save for a goal, so you can buy something you really want later on. You see, William, it's just as true today as it was the first time I said it. "A penny saved is a penny earned." -Thank you. I'm out of here. -Now, suppose you decided to have a budget. How would you start? -Well... -[Mike] With lots of money. -The first thing I would do is to estimate my income. -That's right. Figure it out. By the week, in your case. -[Servo] Shouldn't take long to estimate $0.50. -Estimate my income. -[Benjamin] Then you must decide just how you're going to spend your money. -That's right. Plan my spending. Plan my spending. -Could you get your stomach off my desk, please? -How do I do that? -Well... -[Mike] Have illegitimate children. -[robots laugh] -You may not be able to do it very accurately at first, but you'll keep adjusting your budget as you go along until you get it, so that it fits. And that's the third point. Keep it flexible. -Keep... -[Mike] Pretending to write. -...budget flexible. -[Benjamin] Yes. Do not ever let it become too rigid. If you do, you'll become a prisoner to it. -[Mike] Hey! -And finally, you must plan your savings. -[William] Plan my savings. -[Servo] William, what are you doing in there? You're not talking to the founding fathers again, are you? -If you'll remember these few simple rules, William, I'm sure that you'll find it very easy to stay out of "the red". -Dead people have too much time on their hands. -[Servo] Oh, and, uh, kill your parents. Bye. -[Mike] But it was too late. William filed Chapter 11. -That was my darkest vision yet. [Servo humming eerie music] -[Servo] I knew then, I had to blow up the school. -[Servo] Ooh. -[Mike] Son, you're in deep to mother and me. -That's interesting, Bill. -Oh, hi, Dad. -A budget, isn't it? -Yep. Just finishing it. -Yeah, this is my weekly feigning of interest in you, son. -[Servo] You're gonna buy a dress? -Hm. Pretty good. -Helter Skelter. Very nice. -How'd you happen to do this? -Oh, I just got to thinking. -I see. Well, it'll be interesting to see how long you stick to it. -[Mike] You little loser. -Oh, I don't intend to stick too close to this to start with. I'll keep adjusting it as I go along. -Oh? -Sure. That's important, to keep a budget flexible. -Like Gumby. -Or you'll find yourself a prisoner to it. -[Servo] By the way, have you seen your mother lately? -You got a point there, son. -[Mike] Well, I've got to go sit downstairs. -Take that budget of yours, Dad. -And shove it. -Don't you think maybe it's a little too rigid? -What? -[Servo laughing] -Couldn't you stretch it out this one time? So you could let me have a dollar and a half for that dance? -[Mike] All right, son. I will go to the dance with you. -OK, son, you win this time. Oh, uh, what'll I charge this to on my budget? -Education. -Whose? Yours or mine? -See you next week, son. -Here you are, son. -Gee, thanks, Dad. -Thanks a lot, loser. -[William] Thank you, Mr. Franklin. -[Servo] For making us laugh about love again. -[Mike] Benjamin Franklin was tried in the 8th Circuit Court on stalking charges. In a minute, the results of that trial. [all exclaiming] -[Crow] I'm having a freak-out up to 10 years later! [narrator] An American democracy. -[Servo] Would be really great. [narrator] Island of old world elegance. -Guam? [narrator] Rich in its heritage of art and culture. -[Mike] With wah-wah pedals playing constantly. [narrator] A wealth of historic grandeur and beauty. -[Servo] Does not exist here. -[Mike] Who's the cat who would risk his life for a fellow man? Shaft. Yeah. Can you dig it? [narrator] Year round sun makes this island a vacation paradise. -[Crow] And very hard to sleep. [narrator] And today, it is also a land of progress. -[Servo] But we can't tell you where it is. [narrator] Building into the clean blue skies, -the island is on the move. -[Mike] Hawaii? -No, an island. -[narrator] Apartment complexes, bilingual schools... -[Servo] Bisexual students. [narrator] ...modern hospitals... -[Servo] Are not here. [narrator] ...luxury hotels. -Are desperately needed. [narrator] Progress can be seen everywhere. -[Mike] In places other than this. -Circle Pines is really thriving. [narrator] This is Puerto Rico, Progress Island, USA. -Oh. When did they change the name? -[Servo] A Quinn Martin production. -[all humming along with the music] -[all] Puerto Rico! [narrator] Puerto Rico, a 1,000 miles southeast of Florida, where the Atlantic meets the Caribbean. -[Mike] And they really hit it off. [narrator] A land the size of Rhode Island, it is just as American in its way of life. -So you might as well just stay where you are. -[Servo] Ah, indigenous cuisine. -[Mike] With this, and this, and that! -[Crow] Here, money is exchanged for coconuts. [narrator] Puerto Rico is permanently associated with the United States. Its three million people are US citizens, and like other Americans, enjoy a representative form of government. -[Servo] Feel the glory of the royal scam. [narrator] The capital, in San Juan, where the Senate and House of Representatives form the legislature. -[Mike] Newt Gingrich is the head of that, too. [narrator] La Fortaleza, built by the Spanish in 1540, it is the oldest governor's mansion in the Western Hemisphere. -And it shows. Whoo! [narrator] The promise of this land is fostered through education. Institutions like the University of Puerto Rico contribute to continuing progress. -[Servo] But not much. [narrator] Here, one-third of the entire population is in schools. -[Mike] Latka Gravas goes to class. -[Servo imitates Latka] Thank you very much. -It's room dos dos dos. [narrator] Today, the island's educational system attracts young people from around the world. -[Servo] But mainly from Puerto Rico. -[Mike] Here, we're flying in another trumpet section. -That nose wheel feels mushy. [narrator] San Juan International Airport, crossroads of a global network of air transportation. -[Servo] It's real neat. Ooh! [narrator] Travel from anywhere in the world in a matter of hours. -[Mike] Just like everywhere else in the world. -OK, let's get funky now. -[Servo] Yes, even the air supports airplanes just as it does in the not better United States. [narrator] For the visitor, Progress Island offers a tremendous variety of experiences, beginning with the rich and colorful heritage of the Caribbean. -Which we buried in order to build skyscrapers. -[Mike] Look, just come here. {\an8}[narrator] The fortress of San Felipe del Morro. -[Servo] Is to be avoided at all times. -[Crow] Ooh. [narrator] Constructed in 1591, it withstood the attacks of Sir Francis Drake, and witnessed many battles throughout its proud history. -[Servo] Fun times at Guantanamo. -[Servo, Mike and Crow] Progress! [narrator] The streets of old San Juan, once the cornerstone of Spain's Caribbean empire. -Now the site of numerous muggings. -[Servo] No! ♪ Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme ♪ [narrator] Casablanca, home of Ponce de Leon, who sailed with Columbus and established the first permanent settlement on the island. -[Servo] Oh, thanks a lot, Ponce. -And here's where the nuns sleep. [narrator] In the rooms and courtyards of Casablanca, one can still hear the echoes of the Spanish main. -[all] Whoa! [narrator] ...authentic costume, dance, and music of old San Juan. -[Crow] Are not here. -[Crow] Valerie Harper lookalike contests are held. -[Mike] Yes, no matter what the culture, folk dancing is stupid. -[Servo] Here, Up With People get down. -[Mike] ♪ Don't break my heart My achy breaky heart Puerto Rican heart ♪ -Well, thanks for coming out tonight and supporting live folk dancing. We have another show coming up, so don't-- [narrator] The Museum of Art in Ponce, a perfect setting for a family outing. -[Crow] I wish we had that for you. [Mike laughs] [narrator] The virtuoso Pablo Casals... -[Crow] Is porky. [narrator] ...founder of the island's finest music festival. The museum collection represents five centuries of American and European art. -[Mike] I'm not speaking to you. [narrator] The cultural institutions of Puerto Rico enjoy an international reputation. -[Servo] For omelets. [narrator] All over the island, abundant recreational facilities await the visitor, old and young. -Like swing sets! [narrator] Championship golf courses, the finest to be found anywhere. -[Servo] Are in Florida. [narrator] The tennis season? Year round. -[Mike] Here, Gilligan plays a set. [narrator] Puerto Rico is an indoor playground, too. There's nonstop excitement both night and day. -[Servo] In Las Vegas and Atlantic City. -[Servo and Crow] Gambling! [narrator] With sunshine 360 days a year, Puerto Rico offers something for everyone. -Like flights out. [narrator] Fun filled lifestyle, whatever your pleasure. -[Mike] Like walking or holding a tennis racquet. -[Servo] Spinal injuries are popular on the island as well. [narrator] Graceful palms, an abundance of beautiful beaches. Puerto Rico is indeed a vacation paradise. -Abundant with pink and white people. [narrator] Resorts like Palmas del Mar blend old world charm with modern convenience. -[Mike] Aw, that means no hamburgers. [narrator] Condominiums, leisure villages, and a complete range of outdoor activities make Progress Island an ideal place to live for every member of the family. -[Servo] Except Mom, Dad, brother, sister, grandpa, grandma. [music playing] -[Servo] Ooh! -[Crow] Hit me! [narrator] A band concert under warm, tropical skies. -The music of John Philip Salsa. [narrator] For the people here, the quality of life is being fulfilled with each coming year. It has formed a continuing pattern of progress that all started more than a quarter of a century ago. -[all] A century ago! [narrator] In the beginning, the economy was based on the land itself. From the time of Columbus, Puerto Rico has been praised for the beauty of her landscape. -[Servo] And sacked and pillaged many, many times. [narrator] Hibiscus and bougainvillea flourish throughout the year. -[Mike] As do popincolicplooky and flingilalalafingulala. [Servo mutters] [narrator] The mild tropical climate encourages many forms of agriculture. -Here are some moo cows. [narrator] Green bananas and young pineapples ripen in the Caribbean sun. -[Servo] Stop with the sexual imagery! [narrator] The largest crop is sugar cane, which has been cultivated here for centuries. -[Mike] So you can sugar frost your damn corn flakes, filthy American pigs. [narrator] Special refineries process the cane into sugar and molasses. And thus is born Puerto Rico's most famous product. -[Servo and Crow] Mm? -[narrator] Rum. -[all cheering] [narrator] The rums of Puerto Rico, many different brands, all with flavors that are remarkably light and dry. -[Servo, drunkenly] I love this job. [hiccup] [narrator] Almost all of the rum sold in the US is produced here, and its export is vital to the economy. So, drink rum constantly. [narrator] Within this building is the heartbeat of that economy, the Economic Development Administration, which has achieved remarkable progress through industrial growth. -[Mike] Here comes the hard sell. [narrator] Operation Bootstrap, a pioneering program for self-help developed by the agency, has created an investment environment which attracts industry from around the world. -You mean cheap labor. -[Mike] Even "sss-p-sss" is here. -[Servo] ♪ Strawberries, marshmallows Tinfoil, and fudge ♪ ♪ And some dingle balls Hanging from trees ♪ -Why, even aliens from Mars are here. [narrator] A skilled workforce makes Puerto Rico the largest manufacturer of many computers, and a leader in solid state technology. -[Mike] Things with blinky, buttony-type things. -[narrator] Pharmaceuticals... -[Servo and Crow] Whoo! [narrator] ...that demand the highest standards of quality and control. -When Judy Garland died, it destroyed Puerto Rico's economy. [narrator] With the help of a generous tax incentive program, hundreds of businesses, both large and small, have grown and prospered here. -[Mike] Even the Pink Jeans Company. [narrator] Manufacturing includes everything from apparel... [Servo humming] [narrator] ...to high technology products for the home and industry. -[Servo] She's plucking her chin hairs! Yuck. -Then KISS came to town! -[Mike] We don't know what this is, folks, but it's definitely Puerto Rico stuff. [narrator] One of the most important operations on Progress Island... -[Servo beatboxing to soundtrack] [narrator] ...is petrochemicals. Nearly two billion dollars has been invested in plants and facilities. -[Servo] And millions poisoned. [Servo beatboxing to music] -Another fun friend! -[Mike] Complete with giant rolls of toilet paper. [narrator] Whatever the industry, Puerto Rico's greatest natural resource is her people. -[Servo] Come exploit her people! -[Mike] Shoo-de-doo. These will never go out of style. -Comes complete with a Peter Frampton album. [narrator] A growing volume of goods from the continental United States arrives in Puerto Rico, now the fifth largest market in the world for US products and services. -[Servo] The fifth or 18th or something. [narrator] Customers here on Progress Island mean over 130,000 jobs throughout all the 50 states. -[Crow giggling] [narrator] And thus, contribute billions of dollars to the nation's economy. -[Servo] Oh. [narrator] Puerto Rico and the United States, a partnership for progress. -[Mike] Whether you like it or not. -[Crow] Ahh! OK, we'll move there! -[Mike] Can you dig it, can you dig it can you dig it, can you dig it? [narrator] An America democracy. -[Mike] Are we starting over? [narrator] Island of old world elegance. Rich in its heritage of art and culture. -Ooh, look at the art. [narrator] A wealth of historic grandeur and beauty. -[Servo] Is found on other islands. [narrator] The Spaniards named it "Puerto Rico". -[Mike] Because they couldn't think of anything else. [narrator] Today, we call it... -[Crow] Cheap Laborville. [narrator] ...Progress Island, USA. -[Servo] Because we have no regard for history, culture, or tradition. -[Mike] We would like to apologize to all the people of Puerto Rico that we did not offend. Bye-bye. -[Servo humming] -Ha. -This is nice, isn't it? -Yep. -Yeah. [rock music playing] -What the heck could that be? -I don't know. Whatever it is, it's annoying. Hey, Cambot, show me Rocket Number nine, will you? [cheering and rock music] -Hey, come on, keep it down! -[Servo] Yeah, you bunch of water buffalo! -What's your problem? -Well, we were just wondering, you know, if you could keep it down. -What do you mean? I mean, what's your deal? Don't you party? -Yeah, party! -Woo! Party! Yeah, we party all the time. -Come on. -Because you can come over anytime, and it's no big deal. -Really? -You know what, you guys? I was just thinking, when we graduate, I'm not gonna see you guys anymore. And I love you guys so much. -Shut up, Shelly! -Well, we were just wondering, you know, if you could pipe down. -Pipe! -[cheering] -Bad choice of words, Mike. -Oh, my God, you guys, Doug gets off in about a half an hour at the Pump and Munch. I gotta get ready, all right? Keep partying! -Hey, here's my two bucks! Who do I pay? -[groan] -What the hell? -Hey, you wanna stick around and party after everyone goes? -Hey, come on over, guys. They got Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Center of the Earth! [cheering] -Crow, come on. Get back here. This is so depressing. This is like something out of our-- -Out of our youth, maybe?

We'll use your donations to transfer these films to fragile, volatile silver nitrate stock, so they'll rot quickly into nature's compost. Now, here's how you can help. If you find a copy of a film as bad as, oh, Aspen Extreme, please, store it in a warm, moist, salty place such as a cheese factory, or your mouth. -Uh, Crow? -The situation is serious. If we don't take action now, the entire filmography of Sylvester Stallone may be available for our children and our grandchildren to view. So if you want to save future generations from the legacy of Cliffhanger, Demolition Man, Cobra-- -Crow? -Rhinestone. -Crow? -Oscar, Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot. -Crow? -I'm on television, Mike! Nighthawks, Paradi-- -Uh, don't you think what you're suggesting is wrong? -You're right, Mike. How awful of me. Where was I? So please, call now, and pledge what you can. Just dial 1-800-LETROT. Won't you? Thank you. -[laughing] Yeah, Crow T. Robot may or may not be back. Uh, just come right this way. Could you? -Important film meeting? -Yeah, that's right. -I'm ready for my close up. Mr. Katzenberg, hello! -[Mike] You look great. -[Mike] Love this movie. -[Servo] Oh, boy. I'm always surprised to see human feces. [narrator] The hunter and the hunted. -[Mike] This fall on ABC. [narrator] With only a few hundred yards between him and the enemy. Jim closes in for the kill. -[Servo] And just as Jim closes in for the kill, so does Mutual of Omaha close in for the kill. [Mike snickers] -She was in Bergman film where she played low self-esteem. -[Mike] Today's Romanian woman. -[Servo] Well, let's see. Was I shot in the gut? Or, no, the leg. No, the arm, I think. Well, some part of me hurts. I'm not sure which. Ow. -Harcourt Fenton Mudd, you dirty, rotten, lazy thing, thing, thing! -[Mike] Bob Mathias is Chet Baker in The Jesse Owens Story. -[Servo] Oh, my muffins! Oh my. -Honey, I'm taking the kids off the find list. -[Lois] Where are the boys? Why are you running? -I have no time to explain, Lois. Stay here. The boys may come back. I've gotta get help. -Uh, but-- but-- but-- what-- don't leave! I mean, c-can I have the canteen? Oh, oh. -[Mike] Lads, he is a wondrous mystery. -Honey, my abandonment issues are coming up! [narrator] Joe Dobson headed north and met Jim. -[Mike] They married and settled down. -[Servo] Well, gotta go! -Hi. Shoot any joggers today? -[Servo sings to soundtrack] ♪ Beast of Yucca Flats, beast of, beast of ♪ ♪ Beast of Yucca Flats ♪ [narrator] Twenty hours without rest and still no enemy. -[Mike] He has an S body. [narrator] In the blistering desert heat, Jim and Joe plan another attack. -[Servo] On what? [narrator] Find the beast and kill him. -OK, it's the same plan. -[Servo purrs suggestively] -[Mike] Ha-ha-ha. [narrator] Man's inhumanity to man. -[Servo] Or beast's inhubeastity to beast. -I'm blocking out the fact that they shot me. I'm not letting it get to me. -[Servo] Oh, would you open the gate, please? I'm near death, for crying out-- Oh, jeez. -[Mike] The fifth grade production of Of Mice And Men. [Servo hums to soundtrack] -[Crow] Oh, there. That feels a lot better. I'm glad I did that. Oh, no one-- no one will see that. -[Servo] Heidi, the mature years. -[Art] Randy? You think we're lost? -[Mike] You can't keep things from kids, huh? -[Randy] I don't know, Art. Maybe. Let's go. -[Crow] Those Donner party people seem very nice. Taxi? -[Servo] Well, I suppose I'll just sit here and wait for death to take me. -[Mike] I'll sew. That's what I'll do. [Servo] Oh, honey. -[Crow] Well, I'll permit myself one Chiclet now. -[Servo] I've been meaning to clean my glasses for months, but you get so busy. -[Mike] I'm sad. -[Crow] Many years later. -[Servo] So, did Francis promise you back end, too? -[Mike] Remarkably, the boys stumble across the source of the Nile. -[Crow] The concept of Wham! is born. -[Art] Randy? Is that water down there? -[Randy] I sure hope so. -[Art] My throat's dry. -[Randy] Mine too. -[Servo] I've seen water before, and I'm pretty sure that's water. -[Mike] He oughta pop that. -[Servo] Ugh. -[Crow] Should we worry about the dead cows laying next to the pond? -[Servo] Hi. Can I play through? -[Mike] Those butts are ripe for kicking. -[Crow] Uh, well, it wasn't water. -[Servo] Oh, cute crop top. -[Mike] Well, we're in Wisconsin now. Or maybe it's Cuba. Or Nevada. Whatever. -[howling] -[Crow] Oh, the young Ed McMahon. -[Servo] Cut it out, Mom. -[Mike] I must pose for my Dustbowl portrait. -Back in '54, there were many gentleman callers I had. -[Mike] Where did they find my third grade teacher? -[Servo] I'm pretty sure this is a shot intended to convey something. -[Crow] This is an odd sort of stalking. -[Mike] I swallowed a bug. -[Crow] He must have dropped a bowl of Cream of Wheat on his head and it hardened. [all chuckle] -[Servo] I think Tor would be more comfortable in a skirt, don't you? -[Mike shudders] Is that yellow tiger tail? -[Crow] Oh, would you close your mouth? -[growling] -[Crow imitates growl] -[growling] -[Servo laughs] You know, for Tor, sneaking up and pursuit are not his forte. -[Mike] You know, Tor was originally offered the role of the mom in this film. [Servo beatboxing to soundtrack] -[Servo] Oh, I think she's going to do an impression. -After a brief moment of almost action, we're back to our normal pace. -[Servo] Flag on the moon. How'd it get there? [whispers] What the hell does that mean? -[Mike] You know, this place is probably nicer than Javorsky's place in Moscow. -[Art] Randy? -[Randy] What? -[Art] Where are we? -[Randy] In a cave, I guess. -[Servo scoffs] -Come on, Art. Be careful. -[Mike] Randy? Do we state the obvious? -[Art] Think that old man can get us up here? -[Randy] Don't talk about it. Come on. -[Crow] You're blocking, Randy. We have issues to deal with. -[Mike] Mm-hm. How the hell did I get up here? -[Servo] ♪ High on hill Live lonely goatherd, lay lay loo ♪ -[Crow] Tor is all the Brothers Johnson rolled into one. -[Randy] Art, get back. -[Mike] Oh, false alarm. It's not Mom. -[grunting] -[Servo] Why?! Why can't I get a baked potato before 5:00 in this town? -[continues grunting] -[Crow] They never should have let Tor improv. -[Servo and Mike imitate grunting] [narrator] The beast, finding his victim gone, unleashes his fury. -[Mike] Aw, fudge-- [mutters]. -[yelling] -[Crow] To the moon, Alice! -[Servo] Tor could have been contender instead bum which am. -Tor have tough day. -[Mike] He always does a few push-ups before turning in. -[Servo] Beautiful night. Tor sleep on porch. -[Mike grunts] With the thing and the-- ah! Yeah. [continues grunting] -[Servo] Think we can jump him, Randy? -Oh, wait. Tor forget to set alarm. -[Servo] The only landscape I know that's enhanced by telephone poles. -[Mike] Would it hurt the Atomic Energy Commission to stop by once in a while to say hello? -[Randy] Art, come on. -[grunts] -[Randy] Get back! -[Crow] What is he, a beast, or my mashuguna grandpa? -[Servo] You kids with your bikes. Ugh! -[Mike] If Hank is gone seven years, I'm free to marry again. -[Crow] Waiting for the romance between Tor and Mom to get going. -[Mike] Yeah, that's a twist. [narrator] With Hank and some helpful neighbors... -[Servo] They raise a barn. -[narrator] ...the search narrows. -[Mike] They're concentrating on the rogue Russian scientists in the neighborhood. -[Crow barking] [Servo meows] -I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. Francis. -[Mike] Now, this could be vacation footage, for all we know. -And the Tasty Freeze staff is brought in to help. -[Servo] What are you, with your rap, and... [groaning] -[Mike] Don't turn off the game! I was watching that! -Argh, I'll teach you kids! -[Servo] The tension is so thick, you could cut it with a knife, but, please, use a spoon. -[Mike] Found a Playboy up here once. Keep your eyes open. -[Crow] Really? -[Mike] What are you, with your running and your [shouts]. -[Crow] With your cactus, and your-- argh! -[Servo] Helpful neighbor shown actual size. -[Mike] That bush is trying to get their attention. -[Servo] Moses is lost in the Sinai. -You forgot your complementary stick! -[Mike] I had a vision I was chased through the desert by Boog Powell. [gunshot] -[Servo] Ooh! Well, it penetrated his back fat. [Crow makes rumble noises] -[Mike] ♪ We fired our guns And the British kept a-comin' ♪ ♪ From the Mississippi to-- ♪ -[Servo] I remember a time when there were thousands of Tors on the plains. Ground would shake. Plains were black with Tors. -Tonight, The Whales of August. -[Mike] McCloud, you shot Penn Jillette. -Tor is posing for a Reuben's painting. -[Servo] Augh! Just kidding. -[Mike] Right by the world's largest Aryan. -[Servo laughs] -[Mike] Hide him. -[Servo] Ew. -[Crow] Look out! He's rolling! -[Servo] Am I late for school? -[Mike makes munching noises] -[Servo] Another trademark Coleman Francis butt shot. -Balanchine. [giggles] -[Mike] Tor's just mad because someone ripped the Froot Loop off his shirt. -[Servo] There, there. Now try swallowing. Is that better? -Tor is a field chiropractor. [Mike] Close your mouth. Quit breathing on me. Please, close your mouth. -[Servo laughs] Tor like this! This fun! -Hey, gotta get to bed. [laughter] [gunshots] [gunshots continue] -[Crow] Oh, that was wonderful. -[Mike] I see the belly of the great white one! -[Servo] J-Jim? {\an8}Now, back away slowly from the crotch. {\an8}-[Joe] Jim. You all right? {\an8}-[Crow] They're going to split him open and crawl inside to stay warm. {\an8}-[Jim] Yeah, I'm all right. {\an8}[Mike] Call me, Tor, hmm? -[Servo] They're gonna find a whole baby deer inside him. -This has been one bleak, weird day. -[Servo] Hey, about that other guy I shot? Let's keep that quiet. -Come on. Let's go. -[Mike] We gotta find that beast. -[Mike] That's the third beast this week. We gotta start regulating them. -[Servo] Slowly, Tor decays into his base elements. [narrator] Joseph Javorsky. -[Mike] Aren't you ashamed of yourself? [narrator] Noted scientist. -Family man, and your candidate for city council! -[Mike] So? What about him? -[Servo] Hank, I'm going back to college. -[Mike] You know, women today just can't wait like they used to. -The Velveteen Rabbit. -[Servo] Isn't it weird that rabbits have ears that look like antennas? -[Mike] That's Trudy. -[Mike] Tell me about that last shot of the rabbits, George. -[Art] Mom? -[Crow] Billy tried to eat my leg. -[Art] Mom? Mom? -[Servo fake-cries] This is so touching. -[Mike whispers] It's OK. -[Crow] Whoop-whoop-whoop. -[Servo] Oh, it's a meat eating rabbit. -[Crow] And they found the mother lode. He's suckling. -[Crow] Oh, uh, hi! I know what this must look like. -You look like my little Ninotschka. -[Mike] OK, remain calm. Don't panic. -[Servo] And now the bunny eats Tor and becomes The Night of the Lepus. -Hey, I got a man down over here! Can I get a medic? [Servo] Just hold on, buddy. You're gonna be OK. -[Mike] Well, nice to meet you, then. -[Crow] Whoo! That was an incredible ending. I just need to sit down for a minute. -Yay! -Whoo-hoo! -Oh, what a sweet victory, eh, Crow? -Ah, sweet. -We're going to bring out Mike in just a moment, but first, a little housekeeping. We've got a wonderful chicken dinner waiting for you all, so if you'll just hold tight, we just wanted to read a few of the many congratulatory telegrams that we've been receiving over the course of the campaign. Crow? -Ah, here's a congratulary, uh-- Here we go, right here. {\an8}This is from Erica Rodriguez Fletcher. And Erica writes, {\an8}"Your show has been a part of our lives since I was in the fourth grade." -[Crow] Wow! Wow! -"I'm in high school now." -"And we still watch your show." -Wow! -"Makes me happy to see our family laugh their heads off together." -Wow! -"We have a pretty stressful life, but you relieve it. -From us all." Ah, thank you. Thank you. -Isn't that sweet? -Thank you, Erica. -Very sweet. --Here's one from Philip White. --Philip White. -White. White. "Greetings, you all. I'm not young, artistic, and precocious, and as not such, would not have a snowball's chance in Minnesota of having my letter put on Still Store." -What? -I don't quite get that, but let's see if we can put-- Oh, no, I'm sorry. We can't put it on Still Store. Sorry. -Can't put it up there. -But wait, here comes Mike! -It's Mike, everybody! -Mike Nelson, Mike Nelson! Thank you, thank you very much. Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike! -Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And thank you. Thank you. And thank you. It was a long and hard campaign, yet we emerged victorious. -[robots] Yay! -We tamed The Beast of Yucca Flats. -[cheering] -We rallied around the Coleman Francis cry. -I'm Cherokee Jack. -We took the worst they had to offer, and we say proudly-- -Coffee? Yes. I like coffee. -With my wife Nancy by my side, we overcame a generation forged in war and discipline by a hard and bitter piece of Harry, England and Saint George. We have been to the mountaintop, and we heard it say "Ich ben ein Berlinner," and "Ain't I a woman?" -First of all, I'd like to say that what we've suffered here tonight is not a defeat. Definitely not a defeat. It may look like defeat. It may feel like defeat. It may even smell like defeat. Oh, what the heck. Frank, I'm going to start slapping you now, and I may never stop. -Let the healing process begin. [theme music interposed with slapping] {\an8}-[yelling]
