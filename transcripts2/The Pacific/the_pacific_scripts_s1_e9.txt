 The Pacific (2010): Season 1, Episode 9 - Okinawa - full transcript 
 The 1st Marine division is now on Okinawa and coming ever closer to defeating the enemy. The weather and the heat are still proving to be difficult but the physical conditions reflect their own mental state. Constant stress from never-ending fighting results in a variety of reactions from the men. For the first time, the men also have to deal with the presence of Japanese civilians, who are being given safe passage through the US lines to safety in the rear. They arrived on Okinawa on April 1, 1945 and in early August they hear that a special type of bomb has been dropped on Japan.
