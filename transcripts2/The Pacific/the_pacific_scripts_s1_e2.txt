Now it's been a quiet sector. It's rough terrain. Topside thinks the japs Are going to attack up by the matanikau, Hoping that they can run their armor Up the coast road right into the airfield. If that happens, they might pull hanneken, Put him up north to reinforce the 5th and the 1st marines. And that is gonna leave us alone, Singled up on the line. Now if the japs do break through And they retake the airfield, Our orders are to take to the jungles And fight as guerrillas. This is not going to happen. Men: Aye aye, sir. Move your men to the line at sector 3. - Get it done. - Men: Aye aye, sir! Basilone, you and rodriguez stay behind. Listen, can you spare this hombre? I need ather runner. Hell, colonel, we're sick of him. Get your shit. Meet me back at the cp. Aye aye, sir. Good luck, man. Hanneken's being pulled up north to the matanikau. Japs will make their push up there.

How thin are we on the line, sir? We're putting the cooks on the line, But don't have enough cooks. Best case, we hear the shit going off on the other side of the ridge. Why the other side? - The japs decided to go around us to hit the airfield. We're too spread out, same as puller and the 7th. Well, same old story for the 1st marines. Two-hour watches tonight all along the line. What you guys smokin'? Raleighs? That's our allotment. Only the officers get the lucky strikes. Well, I can't have my platoon suffering.

( bugle playing ) ( birds twittering ) ( breathing deeply ) It's gone, isn't it? Doesn't matter. I'm enlisting tomorrow. I'd do it tonight if they were open. Eugene-- - I don't need your permission, father. I haven't for some time. The worst thing about treating those combat boys from the great war Wasn't that they had had their flesh torn. It was that they had had their souls torn out. I don't want to look in your eyes someday And see no spark, no love, no... No life. That would break my heart. Give me some time to break the news to your mother. After supper I'll take deacon for a walk. That would do it. Thank you, father. Come on, deacon. Leckie's voice: "the foe you gave was strong and brave And unafraid to die. Speak to the ld for our comrades, Killed when the battle seemed lost. They went to meet a bright defeat-- The hero's holocaust. False is the vaunt of the victor, Empty our living pride. For those who fell there is no hell-- Not for the brave who died." Say hi for me. - What? - Vera. Tell her runner says howdy do. It's not a letter, it's a poem, - An ode. - Hmm. An epitaph in celebration of our glorious victory of guadalcanal. Must be tough to write that poem. I mean what the hell rhymes with "guadalcanal"? How fucked are we now on guadalcanal? Corrigan: Get your gear and stand by to stand by. We're finally leaving this shithole. Man: Clear the raft. Man #2: Squad leaders, make sure all your marines Have all their gear and all their equipment. Jesus fucking christ, out with it. Man: First squad, pick your gear. As fast as a bullet goes... It's just a split second. Manny steps to the left instead of his right... I mean he was - he slowwhere he was and, yeah, byou know...T. He did what he did. You don't ever think about that? You know me, john. I try not to think. If it happens, it happens. We should get moving. Yeah. No chow till 1400. I'm sorry. Hey, we heard there was coffee. Coffee? Shit, I can get you guys some coffee. Milk and sugar? Cook: So how bad was it? 'cause I heard it was bad. - From who? - What do you mean? I mean before you got here, Had you ever even heard of this place? Guadalcanal? Everybody's heard of guadalcanal In the 1st marine division. You guys are on the front page Of every newspaper in america. You're heroes back home.
