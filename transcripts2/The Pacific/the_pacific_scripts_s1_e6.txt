 - How is he, Sid? - Now don't put the boy on the spot. Mrs. Sledge, Eugene's with a lot of good marines. The 1st is the best there is. They're great guys, too. They look after each other. Besides that, well, he's a mortar man, The same as me. Us stovepipe boys, We're always a little behind the hot stuff, Which is a good place to be, let me tell you.

The entire division's moving across the airfield at 0900. First and second platoon will lead, Followed by weapons and third platoon.

All right, Daniels. Just as easily been me counting japs I can't see. But it's not you. Sir, coming across the airfield today... I've never been more scared in my entire life. We're all afraid. All of us. A man who isn't scared out here is either a liar or dead. History is full of wars Fought for 100 reasons. But this war, our war, I want to believe-- I have to believe That every step across that airfield Every man that's wounded, every man I lose-- That it's all worthwhile because our cause is just. Of course, if a just cause came with some hot food and cold water, That'd be okay too. Rest up, boys. - Thought you might need that. - Thank you, sir. Ack ack got me my battlefield commission on the canal. Seems like 1,000 years ago now. You handled yourself well today, sledge. You'll be all right. Just remember your training. Yes, sir. ...Order for the 3rd battalion To make a company-sized frontal assault. G2 thinks the bulk of the Japanese defenses Are dug into the ridges that run up the spine of the valley. Until we take the high ground, they'll keep plastering us. We're moving into the hills! Let's move, people! - Pork chops. - Pork chops? That's my meat. Courtesy of lst-661. - About time. - Thank you. Let's go. Let's go. Saw you reading last night. My bible. Writing too. Ain't supposed to write shit down, you know. It gives the japs valuable intel if they find it. I guess I won't show it to them then. Got a smoke? Thanks, sledgehammer. Sledgehammer. I like that. Jesus Christ. Don't worry. We've got a nickname for you too, bill leyden. We call you ball-peen hammer-- A little hammer for a little man. All right, snafu. Shit 'n' ass... Fuck up. Llittle joke from the little man. - Gunny, get someone from mortars. - Aye, skipper. Burgie, get me an f.O. You too, leyden. Let's go. - First squad, follow me! - Hold 'em here, sergeant. - Set up a security perimeter. - Aye, sir. Set up a security perimeter. Machine guns move out to the left and right flank. Riflemen, faced outwards. Second squad, 36, let's go. 91 over on the right! Looks like two heavy bamboo machine guns, Probably more. I need to get a better look. - Sledge, leyden. - No no, I'm gonna scout it. - You sure? - Yeah. Get your top ready. Skipper, pull back! Stay on those guns! It's a fortress up there. We've gotta move! Pull back! - Pull back! - Let's go! Let's go! Pull back! - Skipper coming in! - Hold your fire! - Radio, get me battalion. - Yes, sir. White castle, this is Harper field. Do you read? Do you read? Master white, ack ack. We've done the recon. Objective is heavily fortified. Limited approaches and plunging fire all the way. We can't take this objective without unacceptable casualties. Do you copy? Fuck. I've got to go back to battalion, Get these orders changed. Good luck. If I don't come back, the company's yours. Do you think he'll come back? You disobey orders, you get court-martialed. You guys, check your weapons. Keep a round chambered. - Done. - Can you believe this bullshit about the dog? Some dog's supposed to smell a jap before me? I don't think so. I appreciate the thought, but ain't no dog gonna make me sleep safe at night. I've got a dog. His name's Deacon. You keep fucking that stovepipe. If the nips come through here at high port with fixed bayonets, You nail 'em with flare and h.E. As fast as you can. - You think you can do that? - We've got it, gunny. I was asking sledgehammer. Yes, gunny haney. Woof. What the fuck was that? Hey, stovetop boys-- woof! What's that? Sounds like some guy having a nightmare. He'd better shut up before every nip on this island knows we're here. Quiet that man down. God damn it, shut up. No! No! Quiet down! Hold him down! Stick him with morphine. Shut that fucker up. Stick him with morphine. Jesus Christ, who the hell is that? Hold him down. Calm down. Help me, please! Help me! That guy is gonna get us all killed if he don't shut up. Hold him down. Hold h. Hit him with something. Help me! All right. Get back to-- Get back to your holes. I guess better him than a of us. Sledgehammer's right. It had to be done. - What you got back there? - What do you want? I'll take a cup of Joe. Hey, peaches, are you gonna waste those? - You made it. - I could say the same about you. I tried to get you a corpsman. - I tried to get back to you. - I know. Lucky, I know. You, uh-- You heard any word about hoosier? Chuckler's still on that goddamn piece-of-shit island. Left a piece of whatever hit me in my arm. I guess I'll never have to buy another drink In Buffalo ever again. I'm gonna grab some coffee. Do you want some? Can you take me topside? I need some air. We've got our orders changed. Regiment wants us hunting japs up the East road. Don't blame yourself. You did the right thing. - Good to have you back, sir. - Thanks. K company, move out! Whoever is up there is getting pounded. You should start to feel better. Feel that. They're starting the engines. Yeah. Hey. Let's go home, Cobber.
