 Say "back the attack" a couple hundred times, Get my picture took- there's not much to it. You have no idea what's coming at you. Better keep your head down. What kind of message is that? - Whoo. - Wow. My kid brother comes to visit me. Am I allowed to even speak to you without saluting, - Sergeant Basilone? - Shut up, you jerk. You know I work for a living. Early morning, Sergeant Basilone. 'Morning, Al. Hey, how did they let this Palooka into a classy joint like the biltmore? This is my brother George, Al.

Yeah, but is she in the best of hands? Sit down! Here we are, gentlemen. - Thanks, Al. - You're welcome. Giovanni, you're everywhere. Yeah, they keep me running. Listen to this: 0900 I got a meeting with the governor, Then a rally at a plant in Glendale. Tonight some big deal at the Hollywood canteen. I had a six-hour pass. I go to the movies And who shows up in the newsreel? You, Mom, Pa, and most of New Jersey at John Basilone day. That was crazy. Don't slug me, but can I ask you a question? Take your chances. How scary was it... Guadalcanal? I hope I don't freeze up or make a mistake, is all. - I hope I can be as... - George. Don't feel like you need to prove nothin'. You know what I mean? - No, I... - do you know what I mean? Yeah. Looks like Hawaii. No, it doesn't. Hey, Sledge, Leyden, what are you doing? Looking at land, Oswalt. Man over P.A.: Attention, all hands, make way to debark station. Make all preparations to offload personnel and cargo. Here we go. Get your gear squared away. Look at the new guys. Lookin' for How Company. - This How Company? - Two in. No. Damn. I could have told you. I fuckin' warned you, you fuck. What? Huh? Yeah. Take that, you fuckin' jap! And recover. Hello. This "K" Company? We're supposed to be in 60 mortars, 2nd Squad. Jesus, these guys are supposed to be 60 mortars. This is 2nd Squad. - Robert Oswalt. - Eugene Sledge. You mortars too? Riflemen, 3rd Platoon. Bill Leyden. Then we'll ignore you. That's Snafu. That man's De l'eau and I'm Corporal Burgin. Find yourself a bunk. Taken. Taken. Come on, I'll show you around, Find you another tent. Let's go. This is where they dry-dock us when we're not killing japs. - Over there is chow... - Man: Move it! ...Heads, King Company skipper, Captain Haldane. Everybody calls him Ack Ack. - What's your name? - De l'eau. D-e... L'e-a-u, De l'eau. Jay De l'eau. Were you in Guadalcanal? Gloucester. G-l... Grab a rack in that second tent over there. Thanks. Sure thing. Oh, you know where I could find How Company? 1st Marines? Somewhere over there. - Wanna get some chow? - Been waiting for it. - Ho ho ho. - Runner: We know this guy? Mug's ugly enough to ring a few bells. Gloucester, maybe? Was it Gloucester? - Chuckler: Was it Gloucester? - Was he on Gloucester? - He may have been on Gloucester. - He looks familiar. Maybe he was on Gloucester. - I don't know. He's ugly. - Fuck you all. Looks like a land crab that once crawled up my pee hole. Hey, welcome home, Cobber. You have a good vacation? Anything to get away from you bastards. We're not so lucky. Oh, jeez! Ho, there you go. What's in this? When it tastes this bad, it's hard to tell. What you got? Pens. Tell Santa whether you been naughty or nice. Naughty. The naughtiest. - It's June. - It's the South Pacific. Christmas comes in June. For Hoosier... 'cause he's always saying his prayers, making his bed. - Aw! - All: Awww! - Look at that. - That's beautiful. - Chuckler? - Yes? - Thank you. - Heavier reading. - With pictures. - Here you go. Something for Runner's stocking. Oh, I read this already. I don't believe it. Oh! Something's wrong. Something's very wrong if you made it through Boot Camp. Give me a break, you old greaser! Get up off my deck. - Captain Haldane. - Sir. What's this about, Marine? Some rite of greeting new to the Corps? Yes, Sir. Um, I mean, no, Sir. - Who are you? - Private Eugene Sledge, Sir. You fellas know each other or is this some kind of conflict resolution? Old friends, Sir. Mobile, Alabama, Sir. - Mobile? - Yes, Sir. - Old friends, huh? - That explains it. As you were. But try not to dislocate a shoulder or break an arm. We need both you men healthy. - Sir. - Sir. Carry on. Get me in hot water on the first day. Yeah, well, you deserve it! Welcome to paradise. How do you get used to the smell around here? Think this shitheap stinks now, you should have seen it when we first got here. It was wall-to-wall rats, crabs and rotten coconuts. Thank God I'm rotating home. I can't believe I finally get here and you go home. When you leavin'? When the Marine Corps tells me. - What's your unit? - K-3-5. A mortarman, just like you. Whoo-hoo! Hallelujah. The health of the Corps is only as strong as the health of the individual Marine. Marines will make every effort to keep themselves clean. - Hey! - Ahh! Hey, don't you quit on me, fucker! - You gotta be kidding! - Not till I've rinsed. They get hot chow to you when they can. You know, it might only be crud like this, But when you been on the line taking fire, Hot chow is a miracle. - Oh, for heaven's sake. - What is that, baby food? You know, you laugh... you laugh, But that might be worth its weight in gold someday. You get hungry enough, somebody'll want to trade for it. You do not trade this... Ever. .45 will stop a jap better than a clip of your carbine. You hit one of the suckers in the hand with that, Heh, take his arm right off. You can write your father a nice thank-you note for that. Working party... three of you boots go with Snafu. Hurry up! You heard the Sergeant... Now! You don't mind, do you, Leyden? You assholes are gonna miss cleaning out oil barrels pretty soon. You're gonna be humping up some fucking hill... Or across a beach, Japs pouring shit for fire, Pissing your pants, crying "boo hoo," And wishing you were back here with nothing asked of you But to scrub oil out of drums. Why don't you grab a brush And give us a hand? Fuck that shit. I scrub drums for no man. Can we take a break? Do whatever you want. This ain't my detail. I was supposed to dump you all off here, then report back to the C.P. Then why are you still here? I like to watch the new guys sweat. Ahh! Are those the most butt-ugly creatures You ever saw before in your life? Jesus, Sid. When you start pulling them out of your hooch in the morning, You won't feel so tenderhearted. Lost mine in the polk. Or somebody took it. Maybe one of the swabbies wanted a souvenir. Yeah? Some of the guys think they're good luck. I don't know. You can have this one. I got a couple. Here. - Thank you. - Sure. Sid? What's it like? I slept with a woman in Melbourne. I'm not bragging. But that's at one end, right? And then way down there as far as you can go... And that's what it's like. And that... That you could never imagine. Okay. I'm gonna miss you, Sid. You'll be all right. Woman in movie: Are you angry about something? Man in movie: Of course no I'm glad. I won't cry. Dear Christ in heaven, would you look at her? I don't know how to kiss or I would kiss you. Where do the noses go? There we go! What are you waiting for? Fuck her. Think she's blonde down there? Look, Pilar! Roberto fell in the brook. Cease fire!  Cease fire on the firing line! You stupid, goddamn shavetail son of a bitch! You keep your fucking weapon pointed downrange Or I will shove that fuckin' piece up your sorry fucking ass. Don't look at me, Lieutenant. The Gunny's right. Next relay! You seen Phillips? I believe the angels are shipping out. You might catch them back down at the docks. Sid was my best customer. When you've finished, please return it to the Pacific Library of Congress. Kipling. Always good. Most of these jokers can't read. Have you heard the latest about the other war? There's another war? We invaded Europe. Landed last month in France. Hell, unless you got a brother over there, most guys don't give a shit. My brother landed in Italy, Tank Battalion. Well, I guess you get to give a shit. Just coffee, thanks. That explains it. You're a believer. Yes. Okay, question: God created everything, right? The heavens, the seven seas, the Marine Corps... Sleeping beauty there... Even him. ...Land crabs, rats, mosquitoes. The mosquitoes are a little tough to understand, I guess, but... God created japs too, right... Yellow slants who have tried to kill me on many occasions? Japs come from the garden of Eden too? Well, what we do is up to us. He gives the choice. Free will. Right. Except he's God, of course, so he knows what we're gonna do before we do it. Predestination. So the whole game is fixed by the will of gramps on his throne while we're down here for what? His entertainment? That makes us chumps and God's a sadist. And either way I got no use for him. So what do you believe in? I believe in ammunition. Tell you what, though. Since I'm not on speaking terms with him anymore, Next time you're having a chat with the old geezer, Can you ask him to sink a few jap transports and have them all fall on their bayonets so I can get the fuck out of here and go home? I sure would appreciate it. You go ahead and keep it. I don't know why I have it in the first place. No, thanks. I've got my own. Follow the man in front of you and get off that beach. And when you get to the tree line, remember to clear your weapons of sand. - Aye, Sir. - Mortarmen... - Here you go, Marine. - Thank you, Sir. ...Make sure you have four H. E. Rounds set for fire. Good luck. God bless. You heard the skipper! Get your gear on. Move! How's my pack? Let's get it done, Eugene. 2nd Squad, fourth boat! Get inside! Easy easy! Get inside.

What you gonna do in your stockin' feet When the fucking japs bust through the line? GET BACK! TAKE COVER! You men got enough ammo? Sure thing, skipper. Perimeter's 30 yds out from your hole. L.P.'s out beyond that. The password's "Lilliputian." One man awake at all times. Lilliputian? Hard for the japs to say. Hard for me to say. Trade you. Shit, I forgot about that guy. We're rich, boys. Jap's got a shitload of gold in his teeth. Gold is what? Bucks an ounce? Take the first watch. Wake me up in four hours. Anything moves, kill it. Look at that. You ever been to the Grand Canyon? No. My dad went when he was a boy. He was always going on about it when I was little. I'd ask him about it. He said I had to see it to understand. Finally took me as I was 10, we got there late at night to these cabins. Couldn't see a thing on account of the dark. Next morning we got up, went outside... 10yds from where we slept, the fucking Grand Canyon. A mile down, colors I'd never seen before. My dad was right: Pictures don't show it. You have to be there. Looking down into it. Shut the fuck up, you idiot. We have to go out there tomorrow.
