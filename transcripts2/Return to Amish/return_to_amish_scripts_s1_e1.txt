 [ LAUGHS ] IT'S NOT FUNNY. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS [ CAR HORNS HONKING ] Mary: WOMEN ALWAYS HAVE TO WORK SO HARD TO GET THEIR WORK DONE. THE MEN ALWAYS HAVE IT EASY. BUT THEY PROBABLY DON'T THINK THEY DO. LIFE IS SO DIFFERENT NOW THAN WHAT IT WAS. GOING TO LIVE IN FLORIDA WITH MY SON ABE REALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING. I'M SAD BECAUSE I KNOW MY HUSBAND'S GONNA BE THERE BY HIMSELF. HE HAS TO COOK FOR HIMSELF, WASH HIS OWN CLOTHES. THE BISHOP DEFINITELY IS GONNA MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF ME. I'M GONNA GET PUNISHED. Mary: I HAVE A SON IN SARASOTA. HE DOESN'T KNOW WE'RE COMING. WOW. Mary: I'VE NEVER TALKED TO A DIFFERENT COLORED PERSON BEFORE THAT CLOSE. ARE YOU READY TO GET YOUR PARTY ON? OH, I CAN'T WAIT. CHEERS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME THAT I'VE MADE A DECISION FOR MYSELF. AND I MADE IT BIG. SINCE I GOT BACK FROM FLORIDA, THERE WAS A LOT OF CHANGES. I WAS PRETTY WELL SHUNNED A LONG TIME, BUT THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME. I STILL WENT TO CHURCH. I LOVE GOING TO CHURCH. THAT IS THEIR PROBLEM, NOT MY PROBLEM, BECAUSE I DID NOT SIN. THERE IS NO VERSE IN THE BIBLE THAT YOU CAN'T GO OUT AND HAVE FUN. I LOVE BEING AMISH. MY HUSBAND LOVES BEING AMISH. THAT'S JUST PART OF WHO WE ARE. WHEN YOU'RE SHUNNED, YOU CAN'T WORK WITH THE AMISH. YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING. THERE WAS SOME PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT EVEN STEP ON MY PROPERTY BECAUSE I WAS BEING SHUNNED. ALL I HAVE IS MY FAMILY AND MY EX‐AMISH SECOND FAMILY I GOT CLOSE WITH IN FLORIDA. Mary: A LOT OF PEOPLE SEND CHRISTMAS CARDS, BUT I'M GONNA SEND SOME BOLOGNA. I THINK THEY'LL GET MORE VALUE OUT OF THAT. YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I WENT BACK AMISH TO BE THERE FOR MOM BECAUSE OF HER BEING SHUNNED FROM THE CHURCH. WHO DOESN'T WANT A JAR OF MEAT FOR CHRISTMAS? I KNOW I WOULD. I'M THROWING A CHRISTMAS PARTY, AND I'M TRYING TO REUNITE MY FAMILY AND MY ENGLISH FAMILY. FAMILY, FRIENDS... PEOPLE WHO STICK BY YOU. EXACTLY. SO I'M HOPING WE CAN GET AHOLD OF JEREMIAH, SABRINA, AND KATE. I DON'T THINK KATE'LL COME, 'CAUSE SHE HAS ALL THAT MODELING STUFF IN NEW YORK. OH, I THINK KATE'LL COME WHEN SHE GETS THIS JAR OF BEEF. [ CAR HORN HONKS ] Woman: BEND YOUR, LIKE, FRONT KNEE A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, PERFECT. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] MY NAME IS KATE STOLTZFUS. OH. [ CHUCKLES ] ALL RIGHT. MY NAME IS KATE STOLTZ. SINCE I CAME BACK FROM FLORIDA, MY MODELING CAREER HAS REALLY TAKEN OFF. I CHANGED MY NAME TO STOLTZ BECAUSE I WAS TOLD IT WAS MUCH MORE MARKETABLE. PERFECT. TO SAY THAT I'VE COME A LONG WAY WOULD DEFINITELY BE A GREAT UNDERSTATEMENT. YES, I LOVE IT. LOVE IT. THE BISHOP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE CHURCH. SO BEING THE BISHOP'S DAUGHTER ‐‐ EVERYBODY KIND OF PUTS YOU ON A PEDESTAL AND EXPECTS YOU TO BE PERFECT. I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF BEING A MODEL. I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN TO DRESS UP. IT'S FUN DREAMING. Man: WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS YOU'RE GONNA COME IN, INTRODUCE YOURSELF ‐‐ YOUR NAME, YOUR AGE. YOU'RE GONNA WALK AROUND THE TABLE. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, OKAY? OKAY. WE'RE GONNA TAKE DIGITALS OF BOTH OF YOU GUYS, BUT I NEED YOU GUYS BOTH IN SWIMSUIT AND HEELS. IF MY DAD EVER SAW ME IN A BIKINI, HE WOULD JUST TELL ME TO GO PUT MY CLOTHES ON, AND THEN HE WOULD GIVE ME THIS LONG SPEECH ABOUT HOW A WOMAN ISN'T SUPPOSED TO SHOW SKIN AND THAT A BIKINI DEFINITELY ISN'T MODEST. MY SCHEDULE IS SO PACKED WITH CASTINGS AND FASHION EVENTS, I BARELY HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING TODAY. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] SINCE I'VE LEFT THE AMISH, MY PARENTS REALLY AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT ME LIVING IN NEW YORK OR PURSUING MODELING. HOLIDAYS HAVE BEEN JUST A REMINDER THAT I'M NOT HOME WITH MY FAMILY. I'VE COME SO FAR, AND I WOULDN'T CHANGE IT FOR THE WORLD, BUT SOMETIMES I DO WONDER HOW EVERYONE IS DOING BACK HOME. MY USUAL. ♪♪ SEE YOUR EYES STARING STRAIGHT AT ME ♪♪ ♪♪ AND I KNOW YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE ♪♪ ♪♪ SO TELL ME NOW WHAT IT'S GONNA BE ♪♪ SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S NOWHERE, LIKE, YOU CAN GO? NO. UNLESS... I THINK I'M A LITTLE TOO YOUNG FOR YOU. YOU THINK? [ LAUGHS ] Jeremiah: AFTER EVERYBODY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS DOWN IN FLORIDA, I WAS LIVING WITH ABE AND REBECCA FOR A LITTLE BIT, BUT WE DIDN'T GET ALONG, SO THEY KICKED ME OUT. I LEFT MY PARENTS A LONG TIME AGO. WITH IT BEING CHRISTMAS AND ALL, IT KIND OF SUCKS, 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO GO. BEING AMISH ‐‐ LIKE, WE CAN'T DO NOTHING. WE DO EVERYTHING THE HARD WAY. HE'S BEEN PISSED SINCE THE DAY YOU WERE UP HERE. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S GOT PERSONAL ISSUES. WITH WHAT, ME? YOU WERE MY FRIEND IN NEW YORK. YOU WEREN'T MY BOYFRIEND. I DON'T THINK SHE HAS ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THAT ACTUALLY HURT. JEREMIAH NEEDS A HUG. I DON'T NEED A [BLEEP] HUG, OKAY?! [ CRYING ] MY MOM SAW ME COMING IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND SHE WENT AND LOCKED THE DOOR. IT KIND OF SUCKS, YOU KNOW, NOT HAVING A FAMILY, BUT I'M DOING WHAT I GOT TO DO. [ CAR HORNS HONKING ] Sabrina: FLORIDA WAS AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER, BUT WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. GOING TO PUERTO RICO, I GOT TO SEE MY FAMILY AND SEE WHERE I COME FROM, AND IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE. GROWING UP MENNONITE, I SWORE THAT I WOULD NEVER GO BACK TO LANCASTER, BUT LANCASTER IS HOME, AND IT'S WHERE MY HEART IS, AND IT'S JUST LIKE A BLACK HOLE. I KEEP RETURNING TO IT. ONE DAY, I JUST, LIKE, COULDN'T WAKE UP, AND I WAS SO TIRED, I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT. [ BOTH LAUGH ] [ GRUNTS ] [ LAUGHS ] AFTER I LEFT THE AMISH, I WENT OUT TO L. A. DAMN. THAT'S A BADASS PLACE, MAN. YEAH. OH, MY WORD. YEAH, I'M TIRED OF THIS AMISH [BLEEP] I HATED AMISH CLOTHES ALL MY LIFE. EVERYBODY'S NOT THE SAME, SO WHY DO WE HAVE TO DRESS THE SAME? [BLEEP] I HATE [BLEEP] WOMAN BEATERS. DUDE, IF YOU EVER LAY A HAND ON A [BLEEP] WOMAN AGAIN, AND I WILL BEAT THE [BLEEP] OUT OF YOU. ARE WE CLEAR? THIS CITY IS NOT FOR A COUNTRY BOY. I CAME BACK TO PUNXSY TO TRY TO WIN MY GIRLFRIEND, CHAPEL, BACK, BUT I VIOLATED MY PROBATION AND WENT BACK TO JAIL. ABSOLUTELY. ARE YOU DONE BEING IN TROUBLE? YEAH. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS IS HAPPENING, HOMEY. ME AND CHAPEL HAD OUR UPS AND DOWNS, BUT SHE'S GIVING ME ONE LAST CHANCE TO STAY OUT OF JAIL. I'VE KNOWN HER FOR OVER THREE YEARS NOW. I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AS SOON AS WE STARTED HANGING OUT. YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA CHANGE A COUPLE TIMES, THOUGH. LIKE, HOW MANY TIMES YOU BEEN IN THERE NOW? ONLY LIKE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES. I HAVE TO CHANGE. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. IF I DON'T, I'LL GO TO PRISON FOR TWO TO FIVE YEARS. NONE OF US WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE. I KNOW. I DON'T WANT THAT. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. NOW LET'S JUST SEE IF YOU CAN DO IT. I WOULD LIKE FOR CHAPEL TO MOVE IN WITH ME. I LOVE HER, AND I THINK IT WOULD HELP KEEP ME OUT OF TROUBLE INSTEAD OF GOING OUT AND DOING STUPID [BLEEP] ALL THE PERKS OF GETTING OUT OF JAIL ARE GONNA BE AWESOME, RIGHT? MM‐HMM. Chapel: I WAS READY TO BE DONE WITH HIM, BUT I HAD TO REMEMBER THAT HE STOOD BY ME THROUGH A REALLY HARD TIME IN MY LIFE. A FEW YEARS AGO, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BONE CANCER. AND, LIKE, SHE'S ONE HELL OF A FIGHTER. ANDREW, THROUGH MY DARKEST MOMENTS ‐‐ HE CARRIED ME WHEN I WAS TOO WEAK TO WALK. HE CLEANED MY FACE WHEN I WAS VOMITING. WITHOUT ANDREW, I'M NOT SURE I'D BE HERE TODAY, 'CAUSE A LOT OF THE TIMES, I WANTED TO GIVE UP, BUT HE PUSHED ME. Andrew: IT WAS HARD. LIKE, SHE TRIED TO PUSH ME AWAY. I WAS LIKE, "I LOVE YOU." I SAID, "I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE." AND NOW SHE'S DOING, LIKE ‐‐ SHE'S DOING REALLY GOOD. ♪♪ FAST AS YOU CAN ♪♪ Chapel: THIS IS DEFINITELY ANDREW'S LAST CHANCE. IF HE KEEPS COMING IN AND OUT OF HERE, I'M DONE. I'M NOT GONNA KEEP WAITING AROUND. I NEED HIM TO... TO DO SOMETHING MORE. YOU'RE OPENING THE DOOR FOR ME? YEAH. OH, MY GOODNESS. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. [ HEARTBEAT ] Sabrina: I'M REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE MY OWN BABY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M NERVOUS, BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN THROUGH IT BEFORE. MY PARENTS DO NOT TALK TO ME ANYMORE BECAUSE I'M A WHORE BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT AND I'M NOT MARRIED. IT REALLY MADE ME SAD, BECAUSE MY DAD TOLD ME THAT MY BABY IS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THEM. I'M SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT, AND MY MENNONITE FAMILY WON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. MY BODY IS GOING THROUGH ALL THESE CHANGES, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. SO, ANY LAST QUESTIONS? DO YOU THINK MY DOG KNOWS THAT I'M PREGNANT? DOES YOUR DOG KNOW THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT? MY MOM NEVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT SEX. SHE NEVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT BABIES. I THOUGHT BABIES CAME OUT OF A WOMAN'S BELLY BUTTON. LIKE, I THOUGHT THE BELLY BUTTON OPENED UP, AND THE BABY CAME OUT. LIKE, YEAH. THE OTHER NIGHT, I BENT OVER... MM‐HMM. ...AND I HEARD, LIKE, THIS POP. YOU DON'T THINK, LIKE, I BROKE ITS LEG OR SOMETHING? UNH‐UNH. NOW, I HEARD THAT SOMETIMES YOU'RE PUSHING SO HARD THAT YOU BLOW YOUR ASS[BLEEP] OUT. IS THAT TRUE? NO. SOMEBODY TOLD ME THIS WOMAN PUSHED SO HARD THAT HER ASS[BLEEP] CAME FLYING OUT, AND THERE WAS THIS LITTLE, ROUND, PINK THING LAYING THERE. THE WORST THING THAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT MOMS SOMETIMES GET REALLY BAD HEMORRHOIDS FROM PUSHING. I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING, REALLY. THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS GOOGLE STUFF, AND THEN YOU FREAK YOURSELF OUT EVEN MORE. [ CHUCKLES ] AND WILL THE FATHER BE PRESENT FOR THE BIRTH? IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG, COMPLICATED ROAD WITH THE FATHER OF MY BABY, AND I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE DISCUSSING IT RIGHT NOW. SO, ANY LAST QUESTIONS? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I WAS REALLY HAPPY THAT MARY SENT ME AN INVITATION TO CHRISTMAS DINNER, AND I AM GOING TO TOTALLY TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE FOR A WHILE. SO, EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD, SO I'LL SEE YOU AT YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT. OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD. ALL RIGHT? MARY'S KIND OF LIKE A MOTHER FIGURE FOR ALL OF US. A LOT OF US DON'T HAVE OUR FAMILIES ANYMORE, AND FOR MARY TO MAKE US FEEL LIKE WE'RE PART OF HERS IS JUST AN OFFER THAT NONE OF US CAN REFUSE. PUNXSUTAWNEY, HERE I COME. Y'ALL ARE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE. MOM AND DAD, THEY WERE PRETTY UPSET WHEN I WENT TO JAIL, AND I ALREADY TALKED TO MOM, BUT I'M PRETTY SCARED ABOUT TALKING TO DAD. Mary: OH, ANDY, YOU'RE HOME! HEY. THE BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT I COULD HAVE WAS ANDREW COMING HOME FROM JAIL. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] MOM AND DAD, THEY, LIKE, RAISED US STRICTLY AMISH ‐‐ LIKE, NO ELECTRICITY, NO NOTHING. WE HAD RADIOS, AND DAD WOULD FIND AND SMASH THEM. WE'D GO BUY ANOTHER ONE, AND DAD WOULD FIND IT AND SMASH IT AGAIN. HELL, WE WENT THROUGH LIKE $3,000, $4,000 WORTH OF RADIOS. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] Andrew: IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO DISAPPOINT MY DAD BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST GUYS I KNOW. MY NAME'S CHESTER SCHMUCKER, AND I'M THE BOSS OF THE HOUSE. Mary: I MET CHESTER WHEN I WAS HAVING A BAKE SALE. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] Chester: WHEN I SAW MARY, I KNEW THAT I LIKED HER. I TOOK A CHANCE, AND I LUCKED OUT. THE AMISH DON'T TALK MUCH ABOUT LOOKS, BUT CHESTER IS SUCH A GOOD‐LOOKING MAN. HE STANDS BY ME NO MATTER WHAT TROUBLE I GET INTO. SHE HAS A LOT OF NICE PERSONALITY... AND SHE'S A GOOD COOK. [ LAUGHS ] ONE THING I'LL NEVER DO IS TURN MY BACK ON THE FAMILY. I GUESS I'M GOING A LITTLE SOFT. WELL, ANDY, WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE BACK. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] THAT'S MY FAVORITE. SO, WHAT'S NEW? [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] WE'RE HAVING A BIG CHRISTMAS DINNER. I DON'T KNOW WHO MOM IS EXPECTING FROM HER ENGLISH FRIENDS, BUT IT BETTER NOT THE HELL BE JEREMIAH. HE STARTED A RUMOR ABOUT CHAPEL, AND I DON'T LIKE IT. SO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, KATIE ANN? THERE ANY GUYS IN YOUR LIFE? NO. KATIE ANN HAS THE SCHMUCKER CHARM. I THINK THE BOYS ARE JUST SCARED OF HER. Mary: I HOPE SHE DOESN'T MAKE AFTER YOU, LEAVING AND BEING IN TROUBLE LIKE YOU WERE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR YOU TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE? WHAT? JUST MOVE IN WITH US. I DON'T NEED TO MOVE IN HERE, MOM. I ASKED CHAPEL TO MOVE IN WITH ME. YEAH. I WISH ANDY WOULD STOP SEEING ALL THESE ENGLISH GIRLS AND GO OUT WITH AN AMISH GIRL. I KNOW YOU'RE JUST LOOKING OUT FOR ME, BUT I CAN DO THIS ON MY OWN. WELL, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN COME IF YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO AND HAVE SOME QUIET. TOO BAD AMISH DON'T HAVE JAILS, 'CAUSE I'D GO PUT HIM IN A JAIL AND MAKE HIM STAY AMISH. I REALLY NEED A PLACE TO STAY 'CAUSE I'M OUT OF FRIENDS' PLACES TO CRASH. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM FOR US HERE. I CAN SLEEP ON THE COUCH. OH, THAT'S MY BED. AND I FIGURE THAT WITH HER COMING DOWN TO FLORIDA MOVING INTO OUR HOUSE, NOW IT'S TIME SHE RETURNS THE FAVOR. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? CLEANING. I HEARD ABOUT THIS KID FROM MARY, AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE WHAT SHE SAYS. WHAT KIND OF CLOTHES ARE THESE? MY NORMAL CLOTHES. THIS FRIEND OF MARY'S IS KIND OF ODD. HE GOT JEWELRY ON HIS FACE, BUT HE SPEAKS DUTCH PRETTY GOOD. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] USED TO BE AMISH. ORIGINALLY FROM OHIO. HOLMES COUNTY. I KNOW WHERE HOLMES COUNTY'S AT. I BEEN THERE. NO DOUBT. REALLY? YEAH. SO, YOU SELL A LOT OF THEM? OH, YEAH. YEAH. I'M THE BOSS. [ CHUCKLES ] THE AMISH ALLOW HEARING AIDS SO PEOPLE CAN HEAR BETTER. IF YOU CAN'T HEAR A CHURCH SERMON, THAT'S NO GOOD. HAS IT BEEN A HARD ROAD FOR YOU, OR... I HAD A LOT OF STRUGGLES. SOME WAS MY OWN FAULT. SOME WASN'T. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] COMING. Mary: JEREMIAH. OHH. OH, YOU ARE COLD! I CAN'T HUG QUITE AS GOOD AS ABE, BUT I CAN STILL GIVE YOU A HUG. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH. WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE A COAT ON. I WON'T SEE YOUR TATTOOS. [ CHUCKLES ] WHERE ARE YOU STAYING? I FIGURED, KNOWING YOU STAYED WITH US DOWN IN FLORIDA, SO I FIGURED IT'S TIME YOU RETURN THE FAVOR. MARY AND I, WE'VE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES. WHAT THE [BLEEP] GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY. WHAT'S WITH THIS [BLEEP] I'M MOVING IN. YOU KNOW WHAT? SCREW THIS [BLEEP] BUT I KNOW SHE HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR ME. WELL, I GUESS THAT COULD BE ARRANGED. IT'S ONLY FOR A COUPLE DAYS. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CHRISTMAS GET‐TOGETHER HERE. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] OH. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER REALLY GOTTEN A CHRISTMAS INVITATION. IT WAS REALLY COOL THAT MARY THOUGHT OF ME, EVEN THOUGH SHE COULDN'T SPELL MY NAME. MY BROTHER ABE AND I HAD A PRETTY ROCKY RELATIONSHIP. WHEN WE WAS GROWING UP, WE WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER. WHO THE [BLEEP] GREW UP, AND WHO THE [BLEEP] DIDN'T? [BLEEP] ASS [BLEEP] ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, REBECCA MOVED BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA. WE GOT TO DRINKING, AND ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER, AND WE SLEPT TOGETHER. IT WAS JUST AN HONEST MISTAKE. LIKE, I APOLOGIZED TO HER. "IF I WOULD'VE KNOWN THAT YOU AND MY BROTHER WAS GONNA GET TOGETHER," I WAS LIKE, "I WOULD'VE NEVER DONE IT." SO, CAN I COME IN FOR A MINUTE? YEAH, YEAH. COME ON IN. AFTER OUR BIG FIGHT IN FLORIDA, HE APOLOGIZED, WE APOLOGIZED, AND WE KIND OF WENT OUR SEPARATE WAYS FOR A WHILE. AND THEN HE GOT IN TROUBLE. HE WENT TO JAIL. I WENT TO JAIL TO VISIT HIM, AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE ARE BACK IN BEING BROTHERS AGAIN. SO, YOU'RE A CHANGED MAN, HUH? YEP. I AM. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS SIX YEARS AGO, BUT I CAN STILL CONSIDER HIM AS FAMILY NOW. MOM'S GETTING EVERYBODY TOGETHER FOR CHRISTMAS, AND I JUST FIGURE MAYBE WE CAN GO FIND A TREE AND CUT A TREE DOWN AND TAKE IT OUT AND SEE WHAT SHE THINKS. COOL. WE NEVER HAD A CHRISTMAS TREE GROWING UP 'CAUSE THE AMISH THINK IT'S A DISTRACTION OF THE REAL MEANING OF CHRISTMAS. BUT I THINK HAVING A TREE IS NOT GONNA HURT ANYTHING. [ SIGHS ] LOOKS LIKE A GOOD TREE RIGHT THERE. YEAH, I THINK THIS ONE HERE IS PERFECT. YEAH, THIS TREE'S BEAUTIFUL. SO, LET'S GET THIS... DOWN. WHAT DO YOU THINK MOM'S GONNA THINK? THINK SHE'LL LIKE IT? I DON'T KNOW. Andrew: WHO THE HELL DO I SEE BACK THERE? [BLEEP] JEREMIAH. A PIECE OF [BLEEP] TO THE WORLD. HOLY [BLEEP] [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] JEREMIAH IS A FREELOADER, AND HE JUST LOVES DRAMA, AND THAT'S WHY WE HAD TROUBLE WITH HIM AT THE HOUSE. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD GO TO MOM AND DAD'S. I MEAN, HE MUST BE DESPERATE FOR A PLACE TO STAY. THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WAS INVITED HERE. I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] JEREMIAH STARTED A FREAKING RUMOR SAYING THAT CHAPEL WANTED TO SLEEP WITH HIM. IF SOMEBODY TRIES TO FREAKING HUMILIATE THE GIRL I LOVE, THEN HE'S GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME. THIS IS MY FAMILY, NOT YOUR FAMILY. ALL YOU DO IS [BLEEP] START DRAMA, ANYWAY. WHAT KIND OF DRAMA? SAYING THAT MY [BLEEP] GIRL WANTS TO [BLEEP] YOU. NO, I'M [BLEEP] TIRED OF IT. ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW ‐‐ ALL I HEAR IS ‐‐ [BLEEP] NO, SHUT UP AND LISTEN. SURE. GO AHEAD. I'M NOT DONE. I'LL BE THE MAN AND LISTEN, AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA [BLEEP] LISTEN TO ME. I'M TIRED OF THE BULL [BLEEP] ALL I HEAR IS YOU [BLEEP] SAYING ALL KINDS OF [BLEEP] ABOUT CHAPEL. NO. YOU STAY THE [BLEEP] AWAY FROM HER. YOU DONE? YOU DONE?! YES, SHE DID MESSAGE ME WHILE YOU AND HER WERE BROKE UP, HERE, OVER A YEAR AGO. OFF‐CAMERA, I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT ONE. OH, REALLY? REALLY? YEAH! OH, SO, HER SAYING ‐‐ SHE WAS JUST BEING [BLEEP] NICE. IS THAT A CRIME? NO, THAT'S NOT A CRIME. NOT AT ALL. SHUT UP AND LISTEN. YES, SHE DID MESSAGE ME WHILE YOU AND HER WERE BROKE UP, HERE, OVER A YEAR AGO. THIS IS FROM YOU. BULL [BLEEP] THIS MESSAGE COMES FROM YOUR PHONE. REALLY? NO. YEAH. YES, IT DOES. NO, IT DOESN'T. THE [BLEEP] IT DON'T. WHAT ABOUT THE [BLEEP] TEXT MESSAGES TO [BLEEP] GIRLS, YOU WANTING TO HOOK UP WITH THEM, HUH? WHAT ABOUT THAT [BLEEP] WHAT GIRLS? YOU SHOULD KNOW. LISTEN, GUYS, IT'S CHRISTMASTIME. GET IN THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT. GO MAKE A SNOW ANGEL OR DO SOMETHING. I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT, YOU RESPECT YOUR PARENTS' PROPERTY. AND I'M NOT BLAMING JEREMIAH OR I'M NOT BLAMING ANDY. I'M BLAMING BOTH OF THEM. THEY JUST NEED TO DO THEIR ARGUING SOMEWHERE ELSE. I'M TRYING TO [BLEEP] MOVE ON, BUT YET ALL THIS [BLEEP] KEEPS BEING BROUGHT UP. I HAVE THE TEXT MESSAGES TO PROVE IT. THE [BLEEP] IT DON'T. I'M GONNA [BLEEP] PROVE IT. GO FOR IT! YOU WATCH IT. IF ME AND ANDREW NEVER BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN, I DON'T CARE. I'M NOT HERE TO PLEASE HIM. WE'RE AT MOM'S HOUSE. CHILL OUT. I MEAN ‐‐ THEN YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR BROTHER UNDER CONTROL. BECAUSE I WAS INVITED HERE, AND I'M GONNA BE HERE. AS LONG AS YOU KEEP UP YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN HERE AT MOM'S HOUSE, I THINK WE'LL BE GOOD. THAT I CAN DO. GOOD. BUT YOUR BROTHER BETTER BE DOING THE SAME THING. IT'LL HAPPEN. Abe: I DON'T LIKE JEREMIAH MOVING IN WITH MY MOM, BUT I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I KNOW MOM CAN [BLEEP] SLAP HIM HARD ENOUGH WHERE HE'LL FEEL IT FOR A MONTH, SO SHE'LL KEEP HIM IN LINE. WHY IS JEREMIAH EVEN HERE? LIKE, I MEAN, ALL IT IS, IS A BIG SCHEME ANYWAY. DOES HE LIVE IN OHIO, OR WHAT ‐‐ FLORIDA? OR WHERE THE [BLEEP] DOES HE LIVE AT? LAST I HEARD, HE LIVES WHEREVER HE CAN, YOU KNOW, SLEEP. Abe: THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN KEEP JEREMIAH AWAY. I MEAN, IT'S JUST LIKE A DAMN RODENT. HE'S EVERYWHERE. YEAH, JEREMIAH CAN BE A JACKASS SOMETIMES, BUT, STILL, HERE AT MOM'S, LEAVE YOUR DIFFERENCES OUT UP THE ROAD, YOU KNOW? Andrew: I STILL HAVE TO RESPECT MY MOM. BUT IF HE KEEPS MESSING WITH MY FAMILY, I WILL PROBABLY END UP GOING BACK TO JAIL BECAUSE I'LL HUNT HIS ASS DOWN AND [BLEEP] KICK HIS HEAD IN. [BLEEP] Mary: CHRISTMAS FOR THE AMISH ARE ABOUT GOD AND FAMILY. IT'S NOT ABOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS AND DECORATION. ANDY AND ABE TRIED TO PULL A FAST ONE ON ME, BUT I'VE NEVER HAD A CHRISTMAS TREE, AND I DON'T WANT ONE NOW. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] HELLO? MERRY CHRISTMAS! OH, MY GOSH! HOW ARE YOU? MERRY CHRISTMAS. SO, YOU MADE IT! I DID! THE REASON I CAME OUT HERE WAS FOR MARY. I FELT LIKE THE WAY SHE ASKED ME TO COME OUT HERE WAS VERY HEARTFELT, AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYONE AGAIN. YOU'RE AMISH AGAIN? YEAH. IT'S NICE TO HAVE MY LITTLE GIRL BACK. YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] I'M ACTUALLY NOT REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE KATIE ANN BACK IN AMISH CLOTHES. SHE'S REALLY SHY, AND SHE SEEMS TO LISTEN A LOT TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? [ LAUGHING ] WELL, GIVE ME A HUG! I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN FOREVER. [ LAUGHS ] DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. YOU LOOK GOOD. [ LAUGHS ] THANK YOU. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE? I JUST GOT HERE YESTERDAY. OH. SO, HOW'S NEW YORK? IT'S GOOD. I JUST FINISHED WITH A BIG SHOOT, AND... FINGERS CROSSED, I GOT SOMETHING IN FASHION WEEK. I'M REALLY HOPING FOR IT THIS TIME. HEY, WHO'S READY FOR A DRINK?! I AM. [ LAUGHS ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MARY. YES. TO A MERRY CHRISTMAS. MMM. BOY, I THINK THE LAST TIME I HAD A CRANBERRY AND VODKA WAS WITH YOU IN NEW YORK. [ LAUGHS ] Jeremiah: WHAT ALL DID YOU DRINK? I DRANK VODKA CRANBERRIES. [ SIGHS ] HOW MANY? SO MANY. SHE WAS SITTING THERE SLURRING HER WORDS. STOP IT! [ LAUGHTER ] SEEING KATE AGAIN IS ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE. WHAT'S IN YOUR BAG? OH. I JUST RECENTLY DID A SHOOT. [ LAUGHING ] OH, MY GOD! [ CONTINUES LAUGHING ] OH! THESE ARE ALL YOU? THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH. Kate: AMISH PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IN BEING PHOTOGRAPHED, MUCH LESS IN LINGERIE. THEY BELIEVE THAT IT'S A VAIN THING, AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HOW OPEN‐MINDED SHE WAS ABOUT IT. JEREMIAH, YOU CAN KEEP IT. I DON'T THINK MARY WANTS TO SEE IT. THAT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN LOOK AT WHEN YOU GO UPSTAIRS. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY, NO! I WANT TO KEEP THAT! [ LAUGHS ] WHEN I SAW THOSE PICTURES OF KATE, I WAS LIKE, "HOW YOU DOIN'?" ♪♪ I WAS JUST GETTIN' READY TO CRAWL INTO BED ♪♪ ♪♪ WHEN I HEARD SOME TINKLIN' BELLS, OH, NO, NO, LORD ♪♪ ♪♪ "TOYS AND GIFTS FOR EVERYONE," HE SAID ♪♪ ♪♪ BUT HE DIDN'T STOP AT OUR HOUSE THAT NIGHT ♪♪ ♪♪ NO, HE DIDN'T STOP AT OUR HOUSE THAT NIGHT ♪♪ HEY, GOOD MORNING. MERRY CHRISTMAS. OH, GOOD MORNING. MERRY CHRISTMAS, SLEEPYHEADS. I'VE BEEN UP ALL MORNING GETTING READY FOR CHRISTMAS. I'VE BEEN GETTING READY FOR CHRISTMAS, TOO. ARE YOU GONNA HAVE CHRISTMAS DINNER IN OUTFITS LIKE THAT? [ LAUGHS ] WHAT? TO MAKE THIS THE BEST CHRISTMAS DAY EVER, I WOULD LOVE FOR EVERYONE TO WEAR AMISH CLOTHES AGAIN. I HAVE SOME REALLY NICE CLOTHES. OH! MARY, OUT OF RESPECT FOR ME, WILL YOU WEAR ENGLISH CLOTHES? I THINK THE WORLD WOULD ICE OVER. OUT OF RESPECT FOR ME. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE AMISH. IF YOU CAN'T WEAR THE PANTS, CAN YOU WEAR THE SHIRT SO YOUR TATTOOS ARE COVERED UP? MARY'S HOUSE, MARY'S RULES. GET YOUR CLOTHES ON. COME HELP ME. IT WAS WEIRD PUTTING ON THE AMISH DRESS, BUT THAT'S WHAT MARY WANTED, SO WE JUST DID IT FOR HER. WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE DRESS? Mary: OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD, MARY! IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE [BLEEP] JEREMIAH, IF YOU WOULD KNOW HOW NICE YOU LOOK ‐‐ THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY, SO THAT MEANS WE CAN HAVE THE BEST CHRISTMAS EVER. Jeremiah: I LOOK RIDICULOUS, BUT SEEING HOW HAPPY THIS STUPID SHIRT MAKES MARY, IT'S WORTH IT. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO GET READY IS THE CHOCOLATE COATING. Mary: I KNOW. I LOVE MAKING CANDY. MY MOM AND MY SISTERS ALWAYS MADE A TON OF CANDY AND COOKIES BEFORE CHRISTMAS, SO MAKING CANDY WITH MARY WAS A GREAT WAY OF REMINDING ME OF THE TIME I USED TO SPEND WITH THEM. THIS AMISH SHIRT IS HELPING ME WORK REALLY GOOD. AWESOME. I CAN WORK A LOT BETTER NOW. WHO DO YOU ALL HAVE COMING TONIGHT? ABE AND REBECCA, AND THEN ANDY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, CHAPEL. I HAVEN'T MET HER YET. I WORRY ABOUT CHAPEL, BECAUSE ENGLISH PEOPLE CAN BE CRAZY SOMETIMES. YOU LIKE HER, THOUGH? UH, S‐‐ [ SIGHS ] [ LAUGHS ] YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY. I MEAN... [ SIGHS ] WELL, SHE'S JUST LIKE REBECCA. I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THEM IF THEY'RE IN THE FAMILY. YEAH. I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG WITH THEM. AND IT'LL JUST CREATE TENSION BETWEEN YOU TWO INSTEAD OF... YES, EXACTLY. GOOD STUFF. IT IS GOOD. THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO WITH THE BOYS ON CHRISTMAS MORNING. EVERY CHRISTMAS? YEAH. YOU EVER SMOKE A PIPE WITH YOUR DAD? NO, NOT WITH MY DAD. I HAVEN'T DONE A LOT OF THINGS WITH MY DAD THAT I WOULD'VE LIKED TO DONE. BUT IT'S PRETTY COOL SMOKING A PIPE HERE WITH CHESTER. KNOCK, KNOCK. Chester: HI. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. HI, KAYLA! MERRY CHRISTMAS. AMISH CLOTHES? REALLY? HE TOLD ME TO RESPECT THE RULES AROUND HERE LAST TIME I SAW HIM. YEAH, BUT YOU ARE LIVING HERE, SO THAT'S DIFFERENT. THERE'S NO WAY MOM'S GONNA GET US BACK IN THESE AMISH CLOTHES, BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING, DO IT RIGHT, NOT HALFWAY. OH, QUIT BEING THAT MEAN TO HIM. YOU TELL HIM, MARY, 'CAUSE I'M RESPECTING YOUR WISH, AND HE'S NOT. I KNOW! HE'S RESPECTING MY WISH! Rebecca: YEAH, BUT HE LIVES HERE. WE DON'T. OF COURSE, LITTLE MISS GOODY‐TWO‐SHOES WAS WEARING AMISH CLOTHES. LIKE, WHATEVER. LOOK AT YOU! YOU'RE ALMOST READY TO HAVE A BABY. YEAH. I'M ESPECIALLY KNOWN TO NOT HAVE PATIENCE, SO I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT OVER WITH. WELL, IT'S EXCITING, THOUGH. CONGRATULATIONS. OH, THANK YOU. [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] [ CHUCKLES ] [ CHUCKLES ] YOU KNOW, IN THIS HOUSE, IF YOU DON'T WORK, YOU DON'T EAT. I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE EVERYONE COME, BUT WHEN THE KITCHEN GETS FULL, I GET PANICKED. GO, GO, GO. IT'S TOO FULL IN HERE. THIS IS MY KITCHEN. THANK YOU. IT'S AN AMISH CHRISTMAS TRADITION TO MAKE CANDLES. WE USE ORANGE PEELS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO WASTE ANYTHING GOD GIVES US. MERRY CHRISTMAS. SABRINA! SHE'S AMISH. THOUGHT YOU WERE A LINGERIE MODEL. OH, MY GOD! I WAS SHOCKED. SHE'S HUGE. DID YOU THINK SHE WAS GONNA SHOW UP IN HER UNDERWEAR? [ LAUGHTER ] Jeremiah: IT'S NO SECRET THAT SABRINA AND I HAD A RELATIONSHIP. I HEARD SHE'S PREGNANT NOW, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE THEN. SO, HOW IS IT BEING PREGNANT? ARE YOU ENJOYING IT, OR... NO. NO? NO. ARE YOU EXCITED FOR THE BABY? I'M EXCITED FOR THE BABY TO BE OUT, BUT I DON'T LIKE BEING, LIKE, A TREE. LIKE, I FEEL LIKE IT'S CONSTANTLY GOING LIKE THIS INSIDE OF ME. HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING BACK IN LANCASTER? ARE YOU... [ SNIFFLES ] [ CRYING ] [ HYPERVENTILATING ] [ CRYING ] HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING BACK IN LANCASTER? ARE YOU... [ SABRINA CRYING ] [ HYPERVENTILATING ] [ CRYING ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AT HOME. EVERYTHING HAS JUST BEEN REALLY UNSTABLE, AND I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. [ CONTINUES CRYING ] I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT. WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS? KATE, I GOT IT. HAVING A BABY, IT'S NOT A BUCKET OF FUN, YOU KNOW? LIKE, THERE'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND YOU NEED HELP. Kate: YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. SABRINA, ARE YOU OKAY? WANT TO SIT IN MY TRUCK OUT OF THE RAIN FOR A LITTLE BIT? OKAY. I JUST CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS. Jeremiah: GOT IT. Sabrina: THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN LIFE IS LOVE AND FAMILY ‐‐ TO HAVE, JUST, A SUPPORT SYSTEM AROUND YOU OF PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT YOU AND WANT TO BE THERE FOR YOU AND LOVE YOU. AND, LIKE, I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM MY FAMILY AT ALL. [ SOBS, SIGHS ] I SAT WITH HER IN THE TRUCK AND JUST TRIED TO CALM HER DOWN AND LET HER KNOW WE'RE THERE FOR HER TO HELP HER OUT, YOU KNOW, FOR WHATEVER SHE NEEDS, NO MATTER WHAT. REBECCA'S PREGNANT, TOO, SO SHE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY HOW IT IS TO BE PREGNANT AND HAVE THOSE HORMONES AND PREGNANCY FEARS. SHE UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THAT, SO SHE'S IN GOOD HANDS WITH REBECCA. IT FELT REALLY NICE TO HAVE EVERYBODY SUPPORT ME, AND IT JUST REMINDED ME, AGAIN, THAT WE REALLY ARE A FAMILY. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A BAD IDEA. Rebecca: IT IS CUTE. I LIKE IT. I WORKED ON IT ALL DAY. Mary: I'M MAKING AN AMISH CHRISTMAS DINNER ‐‐ TURKEY, POTATOES, GRAVY... [ SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] THIS IS WHAT EVERY AMISH CHRISTMAS LOOKS LIKE. THANK YOU. THE AMISH GIVE GIFTS ON CHRISTMAS JUST LIKE THE ENGLISH, BUT WE GIVE MORE USEFUL THINGS. AN APRON? MARY GAVE ME AN APRON. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WANTS ME TO COOK MORE OR JUST EAT MORE. THIS IS AWESOME. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU, MARY. THANK YOU. IT'S AWESOME. I CAN'T MOVE THE WAY I USED TO, SO IT'S DEFINITELY CONVENIENT TO BE ABLE TO GRAB A STICK AND JUST SCRATCH MYSELF. Rebecca: ARE YOU PLANNING THAT I'M GONNA SEW ABE A SHIRT OR PANTS OR SOMETHING? Mary: WOULD THAT BE TOO HARD? MM‐HMM, 'CAUSE I BUY THEM. JEREMIAH? HMM? DON'T YOU WANT TO SHOW THEM WHAT YOU GOT? IT'S A 2‐BY‐4! [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, YOU WERE ALWAYS DOING KARATE. Sabrina: JEREMIAH CLAIMS THAT HIS HANDS ARE REGISTERED AS DEADLY WEAPONS. HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! HYAH! [ LAUGHTER ] Rebecca: THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THE GIFTS THAT MOM GAVE OUT WOULD BE... THOUGHTFUL. Kate: I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU, TOO. OH, THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. I MADE THIS FOR YOU. Sabrina: OH, THOSE ARE PRETTY. YES. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. I HAND‐PAINTED THEM, SO YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU WASH THEM. Rebecca: KATE'S STILL TRYING TO BE THE LITTLE BISHOP'S DAUGHTER. LIKE... WHATEVER. IT'S SO DUMB. MOM, WHAT TIME IS IT? HUH‐UNH. Mary: I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT ANDY AND CHAPEL WERE LATE. THEY KNEW THAT WAS A SPECIAL DINNER. [ ABE SPEAKING PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] PRAYER IS VERY IMPORTANT. TYPICAL AMISH HOMES, WE DO A SILENT PRAYER BEFORE WE EAT AND AFTERWARDS. OKAY. Rebecca: DAD, YOU HAVE TO PASS THE... THAT WAY. I HAVE A NICE, BIG SURPRISE FOR YOU. WHAT? IT'S NOT THAT BAD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDRESS IN FRONT OF US. WHAT? [ LAUGHS ] I HOPE NOT. CRANBERRY JUICE? YOU JUST DRINK IT STRAIGHT? [ LAUGHS ] CHRISTMAS AT MARY'S HOUSE WAS DEFINITELY A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT I GREW UP WITH BECAUSE SHE GOT THE VODKA OUT AND EVERYTHING, SO WE WERE HAVING FUN. ♪♪ WAKE, WAKE THE OTHERS ♪♪ ♪♪ LET 'EM COME ♪♪ ♪♪ WAKE IN THE MORNINGS ♪♪ Sabrina: JUST BEING AROUND MARY, I THINK, MAKES EVERYBODY FEEL REALLY SECURE AND SETTLED AND AT PEACE JUST BECAUSE SHE IS WHERE WE COME FROM, AND SHE'S STEADY AND STRONG. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT WE ALL SAT DOWN FOR A MEAL TOGETHER? Mary: IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. WOULD'VE BEEN DOWN IN FLORIDA THAT WE DID THIS. [ Chuckling ] AS MUCH AS I WOULD'VE SAID NO A YEAR AGO, AT THIS POINT, WE'RE ALMOST LIKE A FAMILY BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE ALL GONNA BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER. Sabrina: SHE KNOWS HOW TO DO A SHOT NOW THANKS TO ME. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTMASES EVER. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LATE ANDY IS. I GUESS I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO PADDLE HIS BEHIND. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU COULD DEFINITELY TELL MOM WAS GETTING NERVOUS. WE ALL KIND OF KNOW THERE'S SOME TENSION BETWEEN JEREMIAH AND ANDY AND CHAPEL, BUT NONE OF US REALLY KNOW WHY. YOU KNOW ANDY. HE ALWAYS IS SLOW. Jeremiah: IF THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP BECAUSE OF ME, IT GOES TO SHOW HOW IMMATURE THEY ARE. I DON'T THINK ANDY REALIZES HOW LUCKY HE IS TO BE PART OF THIS FAMILY. Kate: THERE THEY ARE. Mary: OH! YOU ALMOST DIDN'T GET ANY. OH, YEAH? THAT'S NOT VERY NICE. Chester: WHERE WERE YOU? THAT GUY HAS THE FREAKING NERVE TO SIT THERE WITH MY FAMILY FOR THE [BLEEP] THAT HE'S PULLED. ANDY, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? THINGS TO DO AND PLACES TO GO. YOU'RE REALLY QUIET TONIGHT, JEREMIAH. Mary: I KNOW. YOU'RE REALLY QUIET. I'M ENJOYING THE GOOD FOOD. MM‐HMM. THE DINNER WAS VERY AWKWARD. VERY AWKWARD. I OFFERED JEREMIAH A PLACE TO STAY. HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO TELL PEOPLE THAT I INVITED HIM TO SLEEP IN MY BED. [ SIGHS ] JEREMIAH, YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY? NOPE. QUIET PEOPLE DON'T MAKE GOOD COMPANY. Jeremiah: CHAPEL CALLED ME OUT. SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT TO DROP STUFF, LET IT GO. ARE YOU STILL DWELLING ON THAT, CHAPEL? BECAUSE I GREW UP AND I MOVED PAST THAT NOW. NICE WEATHER TODAY, WASN'T IT, MARY? I JUST WANT JEREMIAH TO STOP TELLING PEOPLE I TRIED TO SLEEP WITH HIM. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THIS IS JUST PETTY DRAMA THAT YOU GUYS ARE FIGHTING ABOUT. IF YOU WANTED TO, LIKE, CLEAR THE AIR AND MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A SLUT YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT YOUR PROOF. IT'S NOT MY FAULT. Sabrina: CHAPEL, NOTHING IS EVER JEREMIAH'S FAULT. I DON'T REALLY KNOW CHAPEL THAT WELL, BUT I FEEL SORRY FOR HER. JEREMIAH USED TO BE A REAL [BLEEP] THAT ‐‐ THAT ‐‐ THAT'S NOT ME. THAT'S THEM. AND HE STILL CAN BE, BUT I'M NOT ONE TO JUDGE, LIKE, AT ALL. I SAID, "HEY, YOU CAN COME STAY AT MY HOUSE, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH." OH, MY GOD. I'M DONE TALKING ABOUT IT. AND THIS IS MARY'S HOUSE AND SHE SAID NO ARGUING, SO... Mary: I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EARS WITH ALL THE CRAZINESS. I JUST WANTED A NICE CHRISTMAS DINNER. LIKE, EVERYONE HERE TALKS A BUNCH OF CRAZY CRAP ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE BUT NO ONE WANTS TO SAY ANYTHING. YOU CAN STAY DOWN HERE AS A LITTLE KID, BUT I'M MOVING ON AND I'M GROWING UP. SO, IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ADULT THEN... TO CALL ME AN IMMATURE CHILD ‐‐ JEREMIAH CAN'T GET THROUGH HALF OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. I'M A GROWN‐ASS ADULT WHO DOES WHAT I HAVE TO DO. ARE YOU TAKING CARE OF YOUR KIDS RIGHT NOW? DON'T YOU EVER [BLEEP] IN THIS LIFE BRING IN MY KIDS AGAIN. EVER. I'VE KNOWN JEREMIAH FOR A LONG TIME, BUT THAT'S ONE THING YOU DON'T DO IS BRING UP HIS KIDS. YOU BETTER GET HER THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE OR YOU LET ME LEAVE NOW. OR WHAT? I'M DONE. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] Jeremiah: I TOLD YOU IF MY KIDS GET BROUGHT INTO IT I'M DONE. I'M DONE. NOW HE'S PISSED. JUST [BLEEP] LEAVE. Chapel: LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO, BUT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED ME AN IMMATURE CHILD. LIKE, I'M MORE MATURE THAN YOU AND MORE GROWN THAN YOU. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND TELL ME I'M AN IMMATURE CHILD. [ SIGHS ] I DON'T KNOW THE ENTIRE STORY, BUT... [ SIGHS ] Jeremiah: IT'S CHILDISH. IF YOU KEEP DWELLING ON [BLEEP] KEEP BRINGING [BLEEP] UP LIKE THAT. I SAID WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT YOU CAN [BLEEP] MOVE ON. Chapel: LOOK, I APOLOGIZE FOR BRINGING UP YOUR KIDS, BUT YOU CALLED ME AN IMMATURE CHILD. I'M ‐‐ I'M BY FAR AN IMMATURE CHILD. LIKE, YOU SAY YOU'RE MORE MATURE THAN I AM? WHEN YOU KEEP IT GOING, WHAT IS THAT? WHEN YOU JUST KEEP IT GOING, KEEP DWELLING, THAT IS CHILDISH, OKAY? SO, WHEN YOU MOVE ON, WHEN YOU BECOME AN ADULT, YOU LEARN TO MOVE ON FROM STUFF. OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT TO HEAR IT FROM EVERYBODY. IT JUST KEEPS COMING. PEOPLE DON'T LEAVE IT ALONE. HEARSAY, HEARSAY. BUT WHERE DID THESE PEOPLE GET THEIR INFORMATION? THEY DIDN'T JUST GET IT FROM ANYWHERE. I NEVER HAD A CHRISTMAS DINNER IN MY LIFE LIKE THIS. THEY'RE OUT IN THE FRONT YARD ARGUING, NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MY FOOD. I THINK THIS WHOLE [BLEEP] IS NOT NECESSARY. HEY. Abe: THERE'S ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU ‐‐ YOU DON'T HEAR MY MOM CUSS, BUT WHEN YOU DO, IT'S TIME TO RUN. Chapel: I DON'T LIKE BEING CALLED AN IMMATURE CHILD... SO I HIT HIM WHERE IT HURTS. I'M JUST DONE. I'M DONE. SOMETIMES BEING WITH ALL THOSE AMISH PEOPLE, I FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER. THEY ALL FIGHT AND ARGUE OVER JUST STUPID, PETTY THINGS. Kate: DINNER WAS GREAT AND EVERYTHING, BUT I JUST CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. EVERY TIME WE GET TOGETHER IT'S THE SAME THING. LIKE, I'M ‐‐ I CAN'T TAKE THIS. WELL, THAT'S SO SAD. Rebecca: [ SIGHS ] REBECCA, YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD. I'M JUST HAVING REALLY SHARP PAINS. IT'S JUST ALL TOO MUCH. COME ON, REBECCA. WE BETTER GET YOU LAYING DOWN. I KNEW HAVING ALL THESE PEOPLE OVER WAS GONNA BE A BAD IDEA. NOW CHRISTMAS IS RUINED. THIS IS THE WORST CHRISTMAS EVER. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] I'M GOOD. Abe: YOU'RE GOOD? [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] ARE YOU SURE? THERE. DO YOU THINK SHE'S OKAY? I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. Mary: IT'S AN OLD AMISH TRADITION. SQUEEZING A COMB TAKES AWAY THE PAIN. [ MOANS ] OKAY. Abe: I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE AMISH HOME NURSING BULL CRAP, BUT I GOT TO BE, YOU KNOW, STRONG FOR MY WIFE. Mary: AMISH MIDWIVES, THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO IF SOMETHING TURNS UP. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SCHOOL, THEY LEARN HOW TO BE MIDWIVES. MIDWIVES ARE NICE, THEY'RE CHEAP. IN MY BOOK, EVERY BABY SHOULD BE BORN THAT WAY. THE MIDWIFE MASSAGED MY STOMACH FOR A WHILE AND EVENTUALLY THE PAIN PASSED, BUT IT FELT LIKE FOREVER. I WAS STRESSED TO THE MAX, BUT I'M JUST GLAD MY WIFE IS OKAY. [ SIGHS ] SO, REBECCA IS OKAY. WITH THE COMMOTION AND EVERYTHING, JUST STRESSED HER OUT, AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE GO HOME WHERE IT'S QUIET AND JUST HAVE SOME SPACE FROM EVERYBODY. MOM HAS ALWAYS JUST BEEN A GREAT HELP TO US, ESPECIALLY WITH THE PREGNANCY AND EVERYTHING, BUT IT'S JUST TIME THAT I GET REBECCA HOME AND GET HER SOME PEACE AND QUIET SO SHE CAN RELAX. HEY, CAN I COME IN? HEY. YOU CAN COME IN. WITH ALL THE FIGHTING AND THE CRAZINESS, EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON AROUND US, I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO TALK TO KATIE‐ANN AND SEE HOW SHE'S DOING NOW THAT SHE'S AMISH AGAIN. [ CHUCKLES ] THAT WAS THE CRAZIEST CHRISTMAS DINNER I'VE EVER HAD. IT WAS HORRIBLE. I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN HIM SO ANGRY BEFORE. I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF CHRISTMAS DINNERS AS SOMETHING PLEASANT WHERE EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING AND TALKING. I JUST THINK IT'S SO DISRESPECTFUL. WHAT ABOUT YOU? SO, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? WE NEVER REALLY HAD THE CHANCE TO TALK, WE WERE SO BUSY GETTING READY FOR THE DINNER. DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND, OR WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? NO, I'M STILL SINGLE. YEAH? YEAH. WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S KIND OF HARD. ALL OF THE AMISH EXPECT THE WOMEN TO GET MARRIED BEFORE THEY'RE, LIKE, 23, SO I THINK KATIE‐ANN IS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE TO FIND A BOYFRIEND. A LOT OF THE AMISH BOYS WON'T TALK TO ME BECAUSE OF MOM BEING SHUNNED. WHAT IS IT LIKE, THE BOYS IN NEW YORK? THEY'RE DIFFERENT. THEY'RE NOT RAISED THE WAY THAT THE AMISH PEOPLE ARE RAISED. LIKE, YOU MEET SOMEONE AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF PERSON THEY ARE. 'CAUSE, LIKE, HERE, YOU KNEW ALL THE BOYS SINCE THEY WERE, WHAT, SMALL KIDS. SO, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG TO STRESS OUT ABOUT THAT. IT WAS NICE TO HEAR THAT KATE TOLD ME TO TAKE MY TIME BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS PRESSURING ME TO FIND A BOYFRIEND. I'M, LIKE, THE WORST PERSON TO GIVE BOY ADVICE, BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU, I DON'T FIND THAT AREA IN MY LIFE VERY EASY AS WELL. [ CHUCKLES ] BUT YOU'RE A GOOD CATCH. YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF A GOOD MAN. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD WORRY. GIVE ME A HUG. [ CHUCKLES ] I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. Mary: I AM SO SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT. IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT. OH, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. DINNER WAS DELICIOUS AND I WAS GLAD TO BE HERE. I DON'T LIKE DRAMA, ESPECIALLY ON CHRISTMAS. IF YOU EVER NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THAT, YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME TO COME TO NEW YORK. YEAH. [ HORN HONKS ] OH, WELL, MY RIDE IS HERE, SO... BUT THANKS AGAIN FOR THE INVITATION. IT WAS ‐‐ DINNER WAS SO GOOD. I WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE KATE COME, AND I THINK I'M DEFINITELY GONNA TAKE HER UP ON HER OFFER. Chester: MORNING. WHEN YOU'RE BREAKING THE RULES, YOU GET SHUNNED FROM THE CHURCH. IF YOU'RE SHUNNED YOU CAN'T WORK WITH ANOTHER PERSON THAT IS WITH THE CHURCH, AND IT'S A LONG PROCESS TO GET BACK INTO THE CHURCH. IT'S A GOOD THING CHESTER IS A VERY UNDERSTANDING HUSBAND. HAVING THAT STUFF AT THE HOUSE LIKE THIS, THAT JUST AIN'T GONNA WORK. Mary: I DON'T WANT TO GET YOU SHUNNED. HAVING THE ENGLISH KIDS OUTSIDE THE HOUSE YELLING AND SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER WOULD NOT LOOK GOOD IF THE BISHOP WOULD COME. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO CATCH UP WITH SABRINA, AND I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU GONNA TALK TO ME? Kate: GETTING AN AUDITION AT FASHION WEEK IS, LIKE, THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN. Cesar: KATIE, CAN YOU WALK FOR US? TO NOT GET THE JOB, IT WOULD LEAVE ME CRUSHED. CHESTER AND I HAVE BEEN GETTING AN AMISH CHEST READY FOR KATIE‐ANN WHEN SHE GETS A HUSBAND. THE CHEST IS FILLED WITH FAMILY REMEMBRANCE, THINGS SHE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP FOR YEARS AND YEARS. AND THEN YOU GO HOME WITH THEM. BUT YOU CAN ONLY STAY UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND THEN YOU GOT TO GO HOME. NO FUNNY BUSINESS. Mary: I KNOW KATIE‐ANN THINKS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PRESSURING HER, BUT I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HER TO SETTLE DOWN AND FIND A NICE BOY. [ DOG BARKING ] Katie Ann: A SING‐IN IS WHERE ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE GET TOGETHER AND THEY SING. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A BOY'S BUGGY BEFORE, BUT I'D LIKE TO. [ CHUCKLES ] [ ALL SINGING IN PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] THE SING‐IN IS THE AMISH VERSION OF GOING TO A BAR ON DATE NIGHT. [ SINGING CONTINUES ] THE SING‐INS ARE HORRIBLE. REALLY HORRIBLE. IT HURTS NOT TO FIND A BOYFRIEND AT THE SING‐IN, BUT WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT IT'LL HAPPEN. OHH. OH, BOY. SO, HOW YOU BEEN? ALL RIGHT. I'M REALLY TIRED. HOW'RE YOU? CAN'T COMPLAIN. YEAH? JEREMIAH AND I HAVE BEEN ON AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER FOR YEARS, AND AFTER HE STORMED OUT OF THE DINNER LIKE THAT I REALIZED THAT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE JUST REALLY NEEDS A FRIEND TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO. I LIKE HIM AS A FRIEND, I JUST DON'T HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM. Jeremiah: YOU WERE IMPORTANT TO ME. YOU NEED TO LEAVE HER ALONE. I'M JUST SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF. ONLY THING I CAN DO IS BE HERE FOR YOU AND WISH YOU LUCK. BECAUSE THE CHRISTMAS DINNER WAS CRAZY, I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO CATCH UP WITH SABRINA, AND I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. SO... YOU GONNA TALK TO ME? [ GROANS ] IS THIS PLACE GOOD? THIS PLACE IS GOOD. UM, GOOD FOOD. WHAT, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE? IT'S NOT YOUR KID. RELAX. YOU HAD ME WORRIED. NO, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY. IT'S HARRY'S. HARRY AND I HAVE HAD AN ON‐AND‐OFF RELATIONSHIP OVER THE YEARS. HAS JEREMIAH BEEN TEXTING YOU? YEAH. WHY? I DON'T KNOW. OKAY. FEEL BETTER? A LOT BETTER. Jeremiah: I FIGURED IT COULD'VE BEEN MINE OR WHATEVER, BUT I COULD ACTUALLY BREATHE EASILY AFTER THAT. OH, BUT NO, OTHER THAN THAT, LIFE IS GOOD. GOOD. I'M ALSO WRITING A BOOK OF POEMS. A BOOK OF WHAT? POEMS. OH, COOL. IF JEREMIAH IS A POET, I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO, TELL ME ONE. ACTUALLY, I CAN GET YOU ONE LATER ON. CAN YOU FREESTYLE? NO. BUT I CAN WRITE A POEM FOR YOU. OH, GOD. THERE ONCE WAS A GIRL, MENNONITE. IN NEW YORK WE FIRST SPENT THE NIGHT. NOW SHE'S PREGNANT, AND IT ISN'T MINE. PHEW, WHAT A PLEASANT DELIGHT. I JUST DON'T NEED ANYTHING, LIKE, WEIRD GOING ON. DO MY THING AND NOT DO YOU. NO. NO, NO, NO, NO. LIKE, JUST... I MEAN, THE PAST IS THE PAST. WE'VE HAD, DEFINITELY ‐‐ DEFINITELY HAD A DIFFERENT HISTORY. YEAH, I'M DEFINITELY COOL WITH BEING JUST FRIENDS. I JUST WANT TO HAVE A, LIKE, MATURE, HAPPY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, LIKE STRICTLY FRIENDS, LIKE, NOTHING ELSE, LIKE... AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK. THAT'S ALL I'M LOOKING FOR IS SOMEBODY TO BE FRIENDS. SOUNDS GOOD. I'M DOWN. Mary: EVEN THOUGH ABE TOLD ME REBECCA NEEDS SOME SPACE, I KNOW BETTER THAN ABE. CHRISTMAS FOR THE AMISH IS ABOUT GOD AND FAMILY. AMISH DO NOT BELIEVE IN DECORATIONS. Rebecca: WHAT DOES MOM NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT GIVING ME SPACE? I MEAN, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ALREADY. I BROUGHT YOU A BIRTHING GOWN. I'M NOT WEARING THAT! YOU'RE DEFINITELY WEARING THIS. NO, I'M NOT. HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU. MOM! SEE? WHAT AM I ‐‐ SO THE BOOBS ARE OUT SO I CAN BREASTFEED? NO, YOU HAVE TO PUT IT ON RIGHT. OH, OKAY. BUT I COULD I WEAR IT BACKWARDS AND I CAN GET AN EPIDURAL. ARE YOU GONNA HAVE AN EPIDURAL? I KNOW ABE AND REBECCA ARE NOT AMISH ANYMORE, BUT I STILL WORRY ABOUT THEM. BUT I'M NOT AMISH. YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO WORK WITH PAIN. OH, GEEZ. I AM OKAY WITH AMISH BEING A PART OF MY LIFE. I DON'T WANT THEM PUSHING THEIR BELIEFS ON ME BECAUSE I DON'T TRY TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE WHAT I DO. IT'S JUST, LIKE, NO MATTER HOW FAR WE GET OR WHAT WE DO, IT'S NEVER ‐‐ IT'S NEVER GOOD ENOUGH. SHE LIVED LIKE THAT FOR 50 SOME YEARS, SO SHE'S, YOU KNOW... SET IN HER WAYS. YEAH. IT'S GONNA TAKE HERE A WHILE TO, YOU KNOW, COME AROUND TO AND GET USED TO US, YOU KNOW, LIVING THIS LIFESTYLE. LIKE, FAMILY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME, BUT I'M NOT GONNA RAISE MY KIDS AMISH. I'VE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD AND I WANT A BETTER LIFE FOR MY KIDS. Kate: FASHION WEEK IS A WEEK‐LONG SHOWCASE WHERE THE WORLD'S BEST DESIGNERS COME TO SHOWCASE THEIR LATEST COLLECTIONS. GETTING AN AUDITION AT FASHION WEEK, AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHOWS IS, LIKE, THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A MODEL. EVER SINCE I COME TO NEW YORK, I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF BEING A PART OF THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK. THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR ME. THIS IS MY FIRST FASHION WEEK CASTING. SO I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] Man: BEAUTIFUL. MY AGENCY SENT ME ON A CASTING TO SEE CESAR GALINDO. HE'S DOING A PRESENTATION FOR HIS NEW LINE CALLED CZAR. Cesar: HELLO. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. HOW'RE YOU? I'M DOING WELL, THANK YOU. KAT‐IE? KATIE. KATIE. YES. KATIE, CAN YOU WALK FOR US? SURE. SO, HAVE YOU DONE ANY SHOWS? I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF PRESENTATIONS AND RUNWAYS, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST FASHION WEEK THAT I'VE DONE. OH, COOL. VERY GOOD. COME OVER HERE. THAT'S NICE. YEAH. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] Cesar: WE SEE HUNDREDS OF GIRLS DO CASTINGS, SO THE COMPETITION IS REALLY FIERCE. SOMETIMES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EXTERIOR IS, LIKE, THE WEAKEST INTERIOR. IT'S A PACKAGE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE PACKAGE TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS. YOUR LEGS ARE THE LONGEST PART OF YOUR BODY. IT GIVES YOU SO MUCH MORE HEIGHT. THE LINE. YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT THAT WAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ CHUCKLES ] SO, WHERE ARE YOU FROM? I'M ORIGINALLY FROM PENNSYLVANIA. WHAT'S YOU BACKGROUND? WELL, MY PARENTS ARE AMISH. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. IT'S HOMAGE. [ Chuckling ] OH, WOW. THAT'S AMAZING. Kate: IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I HATED IT BACK THEN AND NOW IT'S, LIKE, A FASHION STATEMENT TO HAVE THAT SIMPLE, DARK LOOK. THAT IS SIMILAR TO SOMETHING MY FATHER WOULD HAVE WORN. YOUR PARENTS ARE AMISH, YOU WERE RAISED AMISH. SO IT'S AN INTERESTING JUXTAPOSITION. HOW DO YOUR PARENTS FEEL ABOUT THAT? THEY'RE NOT REALLY THRILLED ABOUT MY LIFESTYLE CHOICE. [ BOTH LAUGH ] IT'S SOME PART OF YOUR DNA. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOUR COLLECTION. THANK YOU, KATE. THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE. TO BE IN FASHION WEEK HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DREAM OF MINE, AND TO COME THIS FAR AND TO NOT GET THE JOB... IT WOULD LEAVE ME CRUSHED. [ CLATTER ] Rebecca: WHAT IS SHE DOING NOW? I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW. Kate: I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN THIS NERVOUS BEFORE. YOU GO GET HER FOR US? [ CLATTER ] HERE. WHAT IS SHE DOING NOW? I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT HER DOING STUFF HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MAKING YOU SOMETHING HERBAL TO DRINK. WE JUST TOLD MOM THAT WE NEEDED SOME SPACE AND NOW SHE'S IN MY KITCHEN. SHE NEEDS TO GET OUT OF HERE FAST. IT'S NOT OKAY. I JUST ‐‐ LIKE, IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME. I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW. I JUST ‐‐ HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TELL EVERYBODY THAT I JUST DON'T WANT ANY PEOPLE HERE. I MEAN, I APPRECIATE YOUR TRYING TO HELP, I KNOW YOU HELP A LOT AND I APPRECIATE IT AND I LOVE YOU, BUT RIGHT NOW IS JUST NOT A GOOD TIME. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET SOME REST AND I'M JUST NOT FEELING GOOD. LET'S HURRY UP AND GET PACKED. IF REBECCA DOESN'T WANT US AROUND, KATIE‐ANN AND I WILL JUST GO VISIT SOMEBODY WHO DOES. WE'LL JUST GO TO NEW YORK AND VISIT KATE. I'M ALREADY SHUNNED, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO ANYBODY HERE, SO WHAT'S THE HARM? MAYBE I'LL SNEAK AWAY WITHOUT ANYBODY KNOWING. ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT GOING TO NEW YORK? YES, I AM. I'M REALLY EXCITED. IT'S A LITTLE LONELY HERE. SEEING KATE MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. CHESTER HAS A LOT OF CONCERNS. IF I GO TO NEW YORK, THE CHURCH DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE HAPPY, BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK WE COULD USE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN. [ HORNS HONKING ] Cesar: HEY, HOW ARE YOU? ENTER YOUR WAISTLINE FOR ME, PLEASE, DO YOU MIND? Kate: I'M WAITING TO FIND OUT IF I'VE BEEN PICKED FOR THE FASHION WEEK PRESENTATION AND... [ SIGHS ] ...I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN THIS NERVOUS BEFORE. Cesar: FRESH FACE. SUPER FRESH FACE. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW MANY GIRLS GO INTO A CASTING FOR THREE PEOPLE. OH, BEAUTIFUL. YOU WANT TO TAKE HER DNA, YOU JUST WANT TO MULTIPLY IT. IT'S ALSO A LITTLE NERVE‐RACKING... [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] JUST GORGEOUS. ...BECAUSE THERE'S, LIKE, 6‐FEET‐TALL 16‐YEAR‐OLDS THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL AND GORGEOUS. PERFECT. CAN YOU WALK FOR US, PLEASE? I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER AN HOUR TO FIND OUT IF I GOT PICKED, AND I THINK I'M GONNA GO CRAZY. CAN YOU GO GET HER FOR US? OF COURSE. THANKS. WELL, WE'D LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING YOU IN THE SHOW, AND, UM, WE'D LIKE TO BOOK YOU FOR OUR PRESENTATION. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. I FEEL LIKE I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I FEEL LIKE ALL OF MY HARD WORK AND DEDICATION HAS FINALLY PAID OFF. I FEEL LIKE I'VE MADE IT. Cesar: A LOT OF TIMES, IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT THE HEIGHT OR THE BEAUTY. IT'S ABOUT THE PERSONALITY THAT CAN CARRY THE GARMENT, AND SHE'S GOT THE FULL PACKAGE. Kate: I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING AS BIG AS THIS. NEVER DONE IT IN FRONT OF 600 PEOPLE FOR FASHION WEEK. Cesar: KATE HAS AN INCREDIBLE MATURITY ABOUT HER. SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. I BELIEVE THAT SHE CAN WORK ON HER PRESENTATION OF THE GARMENT. BUT SHE'S YOUNG. SHE'S GONNA LEARN, AND SHE'LL LEARN FAST. I THINK SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES. CHRISTINA WILL GIVE YOU A FITTING TIME AND THEN WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE SHOW. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ♪♪ AND SAY GOOD NIGHT TILL THE SUN COMES UP ♪♪ ♪♪ UNTIL THE LIGHTS GO OUT ♪♪ ♪♪ UNTIL WE BREAK APART ♪♪ ♪♪ UNTIL WE'RE OVER ♪♪ I AM SO EXCITED TO GO TO NEW YORK. AMISH ARE ALLOWED TO RIDE ON BUSES. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DRIVE. I'M GETTING HUNGRY. IT TOOK THREE HOURS AND TWO JARS OF BEEF, BUT WE FINALLY GOT THERE. WELL, WE'RE HERE. OH, MY GOSH. THERE'S SO MANY CARS. EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN TO NEW YORK BEFORE, IT'S WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME. ALL THESE CARS AND PEOPLE, IT'S LIKE TOTAL SHOCK. OH, MY GOSH THERE'S A... YES, WE'RE LOST. WE ACTUALLY HAD KATE'S PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS. THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO GO. I THOUGHT, OH, WE'RE GETTING INTO NEW YORK. IT'S GONNA BE AN EASY PIECE OF CAKE. BUT IT WAS NOT AN EASY PIECE OF CAKE. I HOPE YOU'RE A GOOD DRIVER. NEW YORK KIND OF SCARES ME. OH, MY GOSH. [ HORN HONKS ] [ TIRES SCREECH ] DAMN, THAT MAKES ME MAD. THIS IS WORSE THAN A HORSE AND BUGGY. [ LAUGHS ] BE CAREFUL. DON'T GET HIT. Kate: THE DAY IS HERE, AND I'M ABOUT READY TO WALK OUT. IT'S REALLY HARD NOT TO GET NERVOUS. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] CAMERAS DOWN, CAMERAS DOWN. THE BIKE BUGGY DROPPED US OFF, AND WE'RE HOPING TO FIND KATE. DON'T YOU HAVE TO PRESS SOME OF THOSE BUTTONS, MOM? OH, I DON'T KNOW. [ BUZZER CHIRPS ] OOH. OKAY. HEY, EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME. DO YOU KNOW WHERE KATE IS? [ SPEAKS PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] UNH‐UNH. HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE KATE IS? KATE IS A MODEL. HEY, DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHERE KATE IS? [ LAUGHTER ] NEED A PHONE. HOW DOES NOBODY KNOW WHERE KATE IS? THESE NEW YORKERS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS. YUCK. HEY, DO YOU HAVE A PHONE? THIS IS NOT A LOCAL PHONE. I DON'T KNOW IF I KNOW HOW TO USE A CELLPHONE. YES, YES, A PERFECT DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE. KATE. UH, WE'RE LOST. IT'S GREAT THAT MARY AND KATIE‐ANN COME TO NEW YORK TO VISIT ME, BUT THE TIMING COULD NOT BE WORSE. WHAT STREET ARE WE ON? OH, WE'RE AT 84 AND MULBERRY. OH, MULBERRY. [ SPEAKS PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. THANK YOU. YEAH. BYE. Mary: KATIE‐ANN AND I ARE STRANDED HERE. KATE KNOWS WHERE WE ARE, BUT I DON'T SEE HER ANYWHERE. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OH, WE COME TO SEE YOU. WELL, GET IN THE CAR. WHEN KATE FINALLY SAW US THERE ON THE SIDEWALK, IT WAS ONE OF THE NICEST THINGS THAT WE EVER SAW FOR THE WHOLE DAY. YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE COMING UP. I HAVE, UH... THIS IS FASHION WEEK. A FASHION WEEK? [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S LIKE THE BUSIEST ‐‐ THE BUSIEST WEEK IN FASHION. YEAH, I THINK YOU'LL BE FINE. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF MAGAZINES AND STUFF. KATIE‐ANN IS SO SWEET, BUT I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY MRS. TOUR GUIDE RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET YOU INTO SOME OF THE SHOWS, BUT I'LL TRY TO GET YOU IN SOME OF THE PLACES. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING NEW, SCARY. SCARY AND FUN AND BOTH. MY ROOM IS RIGHT UP HERE. OH, MY. YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GO STAIRS. YES. [ CHUCKLES ] I HAVEN'T DONE THIS MUCH EXERCISE SINCE I WAS A GIRL. ALL RIGHT, WELL, COME ON IN. OH, WOW. COME IN, MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. THIS IS SO SMALL. HOW CAN YOU LIVE LIKE THIS? I GOT REALLY, LIKE, CLAUSTROPHOBIC. I THOUGHT "HOW COULD ANYBODY EVER LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE THAT?" YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME YOU WERE COMING. I WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD WHERE YOU WERE. WELL, WE HAD TO FIND SOMEBODY WITH A PHONE SO WE COULD CALL YOU. ARE YOU HUNGRY? DID YOU EAT ANYTHING TODAY, OR... UH, NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT. YES, I AM HUNGRY. BEING A MODEL MAKES IT CRUCIAL TO EXERCISE PROPERLY, TO EAT PROPERLY, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF AMISH PEOPLE DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT. ALL RIGHT, I HAVE A LITTLE SNACK FOR YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE? SEAWEED. SEAWEED? YES. [ CHUCKLES ] OH, MY GOSH. I THOUGHT WEED WAS ILLEGAL. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF... THIS IS SEAWEED. WELL, MAYBE I HAVE TO TRY IT. [ COUGHS ] THE WEED WAS THE AWFULEST THING I HAVE EVER TASTED. IT'S A LITTLE SPICY. YEAH. I KNOW, FOR ONE THING, I'LL NEVER TRY IT AGAIN. HAVE YOU EVER HAD HUMMUS BEFORE? WHAT IS HUMMUS? IT'S THE DIP RIGHT THERE. IT'S REALLY HEALTHY. IT'S MADE FROM CHICKPEAS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HUMMUS IS, BUT IT SURE LOOKS LIKE [BLEEP] YOU SHOULD TRY IT. IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD. TRY IT. [ CHUCKLES ] I'M REALLY IMPRESSED THAT MARY IS WILLING TO TRY SOME NEW THINGS. MAYBE SHE'LL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OPEN‐MINDED FOR THE REST OF HER NEW YORK TRIP. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU WANTING TO DO WHEN YOU'RE UP IN NEW YORK? DO YOU WANT TO SEE NEW PLACES, MEET MORE PEOPLE? WE CAME DOWN HERE TO GET ADVICE FROM YOU FOR DATING. I DATED A GUY BEFORE, AND HE'S AMISH. IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL. SINCE MOM IS SHUNNED, IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO FIND AN AMISH BOY WHO IS INTERESTED IN ME. I MEAN, HERE IN NEW YORK, YOU COULD MEET PEOPLE THAT AREN'T JUDGING YOU. THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE BACK IN PUNXSUTAWNEY. LIKE, THEY DON'T KNOW YOU. SO IT WILL ACTUALLY BE A GOOD TIME FOR YOU TO JUST GO OUT AND MEET PEOPLE AND HAVE FUN. YOU WON'T HAVE TO FEEL THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING, LIKE, "OH, SHE'S AMISH BUT SHE'S NOT OBEYING THE RULES," AND STUFF LIKE THAT. LIKE, PEOPLE HERE, THEY'RE VERY OPEN‐MINDED. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED THAT KATIE‐ANN WAS ABLE TO OPEN UP TO ME AND SHARE HER EXPERIENCES. I'M NOT A MIRACLE WORKER, BUT [CHUCKLES] I'LL TRY TO HELP HER WHENEVER I CAN. Cesar: MODELS. Kate: I'M SO EXCITED. THIS IS, LIKE, A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] Mary: HEY, KATE! KATE! OVER HERE! [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] CAMERAS DOWN, CAMERAS DOWN. [ INDISTINCT CHATTER ] IT INSPIRED ME AS AN ARTIST. IT'S A NEW YORK ATTITUDE. Kate: TODAY I'M HERE FOR CESAR GALINDO'S CZAR PRESENTATION FOR THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK. I'M SO EXCITED. THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME. THIS IS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. I'M KATE. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, KATE. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHERE YOU FROM? I'M ORIGINALLY FROM PENNSYLVANIA. OKAY. IS THIS YOUR FIRST FASHION WEEK? YEAH, IT ACTUALLY IS. OH, THIS IS YOUR FIRST? I WANT A PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST TO DO MY MAKEUP EVERY DAY. I LOVE THE EXPERIENCE. YOU JUST SIT BACK AND LET SOMEONE ELSE TRANSFORM YOU. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND NOW THAT THE DAY IS HERE AND I'M ABOUT READY TO WALK OUT, IT'S REALLY HARD NOT TO GET NERVOUS. Cesar: COME ON. HEY, HOW ARE YOU? HEY, HONEY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD. I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT I'M WEARING. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR OUTFIT YET? NO. [ BOTH LAUGH ] I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. IT'S A BLACK AND WHITE SHORT DRESS. IT HAS THE FEATHERS ON IT, LITTLE BLACK CAP SLEEVE. PARDON ME, GUYS. SORRY. EDGE RIGHT HERE. SEE THIS? COULD YOU COME WITH ME? I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I GOT TO GET THEM ON STAGE. LAYER, LAYER, LAYER. Kate: WELL, THE SHOW IS ABOUT TO START, SO THE ENTIRE ENERGY OF THE ROOM IS ‐‐ Woman: KATIE, THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU. I HAVE TO GO. [ CHUCKLES ] Cesar: MODELS, MODELS, I NEED YOU GUYS TO COME FORWARD. MODELS, MODELS. [ CLAPS HANDS ] MODELS. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS EDGE HERE. ♪♪ THE KIND THAT LEADS ME ON WITH PRETTY LIES ♪♪ ♪♪ YOU'RE A GIVER, NOT A TAKER ♪♪ YOU CAN STAND RIGHT THERE. STAND RIGHT HERE. FACE THIS WAY. THERE YOU ARE. ♪♪ I'M RISING LIKE A PHOENIX NOW ♪♪ ♪♪ CAN FINALLY TAKE A LOOK AROUND ♪♪ ♪♪ LOOK AROUND, LOOK AROUND ♪♪ ♪♪ LET THE LIGHT SHINE ♪♪ [ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ] ♪♪ NOW IT'S OUR TIME ♪♪ Kate: LOOKING OVER THE CROWD, I REALIZED THAT I'M DOING WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. I'M NO LONGER AMISH, AND I'VE DREAMED OF DOING THIS FOR YEARS, AND IT'S AMAZING THAT I HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. Mary: HEY, KATE! KATE! OVER HERE! I WISH MARY AND KATIE‐ANN COULD PLAY IT A LITTLE BIT COOLER. I CAN'T REALLY WAVE AND I'M NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO SMILE UP HERE, SO IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO CONCENTRATE WHEN THEY CAME. [ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ] I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF MY FASHION PRESENTATION, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MARY AND KATIE‐ANN COME OVER AND ACT LIKE IT'S A PHOTO BOOTH OR SOMETHING. Mary: WHEN WE WENT OVER AND THE DESIGNER COME OVER AND TALK TO US... WE WERE REALLY SURPRISED THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY A GUY DOING DESIGNER. I'M CESAR GALINDO. THESE ARE MY CLOTHES. Mary: OH, REALLY? YES. [ CHUCKLES ] I HOPE SO. Mary: AND HE WANTED TO TAKE A PHOTO OF US WITH KATE, AND IT WAS JUST LIKE A MILLION PEOPLE TAKING PICTURES. [ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ] BACK HOME, IT WAS, LIKE, AGAINST GOD TO HAVE YOUR PICTURE. I HAD MY PICTURE TAKEN LEFT AND RIGHT AND IT MADE ME FEEL SO GOOD. HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHERE'S MOM AT? UH, SHE WENT TO NEW YORK. SHE AND KATIE‐ANN WENT UP TO SEE KATE. AH, OKAY. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GO UP THERE? AH, COME ON. IT AIN'T THAT BAD. [ CLEARS THROAT ] I KNOW WHAT MY DAD IS GOING THROUGH, AND IT SUCKS. IT'S HARD FOR HIM 'CAUSE MOM, SHE LOVES TO DO WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO, AND IT JUST SUCKS ALL AROUND THAT DAD HAS TO PAY FOR IT. SOMEBODY GOT TO LOOK AFTER THE ANIMALS AND STUFF AND TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSE. YOU CAN'T JUST ABANDON THAT STUFF AND GO. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] CAMERAS DOWN, CAMERAS DOWN. Abe: THIS SEASON ON "RETURN TO AMISH"... AM I BOTHERING YOU BY BEING IN PUNXSY? YEAH. Abe: IF YOU DON'T CHANGE, YOU'RE GONNA END UP BACK IN JAIL. YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF KIDS. I HEARD THAT YOUR VAGINA GETS REALLY FLOPPY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Mary: I HOPE KATIE‐ANN IS OKAY. HEY, I'M IN NEW YORK! TELL ME IN A YEAR FROM NOW SHE'S NOT GONNA BE A PORN STAR. ALL WE EVER DO IS SIT AROUND AND [BLEEP] ABOUT KATE ALL THE TIME. I'M TIRED OF IT. THERE'S YOUR [BLEEP] PHONE. YOU JUST BROKE MY [BLEEP] PHONE. [ BELCHES ] NO MORE DRINKS FOR HIM. YOU BROTHER IS TEXTING ME. [ SIGHS ] BUT YOU GUYS DID SLEEP TOGETHER, SO HOW IS THAT A LIE? IT STARTED, BUT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY SLEEP TOGETHER. Abe: AND THEN YOU SAY I DON'T TRY TO HELP YOU. I TRIED AND I GOT [BLEEP] [ SIREN WAILS ] [ REBECCA MOANING ] IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT NOT EATING BEEF OUT OF A JAR. Sabrina: I DON'T REALLY CARE. I'M PREGNANT AND I JUST WANNA EAT. EW! NOT BAD AT ALL. I'M GONNA BE THERE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. WELCOME TO THE CRAZY PEOPLE. Mary: KATIE‐ANN, ARE YOU SCARED TO FLY? Katie Ann: OH, MY GOSH. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE YOU'RE GONNA END UP. THAT'S NOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE. WE LEFT SO WE COULD HAVE OUR FREEDOM. Chester: YOU TOOK YOUR CHOICE AND WENT YOUR WAY, NOW I DON'T WANT NO PART OF IT. I DON'T CARE. I'M DONE WITH MY BROTHER. THE WHOLE ENTIRE CHURCH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RUINING THIS FAMILY. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] [ SABRINA CRIES ] I'M AMISH, WHAT ARE YOU?
