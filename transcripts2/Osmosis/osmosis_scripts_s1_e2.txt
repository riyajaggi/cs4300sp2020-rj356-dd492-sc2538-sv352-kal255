 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES 3 YEARS EARLIER What's this? A brain implant. Where does it come from? I injected it during his transfusion. They're nanorobots. I'm a computer programmer and a graduate in neuroscience. You spend your free time knocking up electronic components that you stick in your brother's goddamn brain? I'm calling security. He's been in a vegetative state for months.

 Look, there's some electrical activity in the areas affected by the disease. It's the implant that's stimulating the neural network. He's still in a vegetative state. You've turned him into a lab rat. What’s he got to lose? We shouldn't even be having this conversation. What's going on? It's coming from him. There’s an increase in neural activity. Yes, but it's not due to the implant. Paul? - What's that? - I don't know. It’s waking him up. The implant triggered something that day.

 A face appeared. Joséphine's face. She's the one who brought me back to life. When I saw her for the very first time… I knew I'd found my soulmate. In one look, Osmosis was born. It's like a… like a connection that's out of this world. Heart beats that synchronize... then merge into one. Self-consciousness disappears. You become… You become something else. Hold on, you're usually connected, but right now you're not? I assume you've also tried calling her mobile? No, you don't get it. So, you're in love. You're telling me your wife's not well, that she’s logged herself off, or whatever. Well. If I were to launch a search operation every time my wife was a mess, I... Are you going to help me? There are cameras all over this city, it can't be that hard. Hello. There are no signs of a struggle. In my opinion, there’s nothing suspicious that would allow us to... I've been getting death threats every day for over a year now. Are you going to launch an investigation, or not? I'll be in touch. Miss. You’ve still not managed to locate her implant? No. DON'T LOOK FOR ME Maybe we're not there yet. Maybe we're about to lead millions of people into a dead end. MAIN TITLE Niels, are you ready to meet your soulmate? I'm kind of freaked out. What if she doesn't like me? Everything’s going to be all right. Breathe. Her name is Claire. You're late! We said eight. Are you Franck? Yes. Lucienne will be here soon, we need to get ready. Okay. What’s left is upstairs, - could you help me with... - Yes, of course. Here, take the stumps and the sanguines. The sanguines. Are… are you really Franck? No, no. Not at all. I'm Niels. Are you an intern? Or an apprentice? No, I… I was looking for you. Have we met before? Yes. Well, no. But… Well… It's as if... it's as if I'd seen you in a... in a dream or... What is this? This is a joke, right? No, I'm sorry. Do you often flirt with girls you’ve never met before? Oh no. No, no. It's... Well, I've never really flirted with girls, I… I could have guessed that. Listen, I'm sorry, I don't want to bother you, if you’ve got things to do… Listen, stay. I need help carrying the stools, anyway. Okay. Love at first sight - live! Niels is off to a good start. What about the others? Half the testers have already met their soulmates. Any feedback from the implants? There’s no loss of data. The reception is good. Here, we can see a big adrenaline rush for Ana. Come on, let’s go, let's warm up! It's not a stroll, keep it up, come on! Keep going, don't give up! Ana, this is Simon. Your soulmate. Come on, let's go, let's go. That's it, good. Can I help you? I'm just lacing up my shoes. Are you here for the fitness class? Are you the one who signed up to join? Why would I do that? I hate sports. To get healthy, to lose some weight. Who says I need to lose weight? No one. It's just that that's usually why people do sports. You think I'm fat? Do you think you're fat? Yes. Stendhal was fat, Flaubert too. You’ve never heard of them? - Yes, of course, I have. - What did he write? - Who? - Flaubert. What is this, a French literature exam? Madame Bovary. Don't you want to give it a go? The first class is free. Is this a marketing strategy, flirting with potential clients? Let's start again. My name is Simon. Ana. Nice to meet you, Ana. Sorry, I'm not very good with words. I guess it's not one of your priorities. Ok. I'll get back to my class. I'm such an idiot. The oxytocin is sky high but so is the cortisol, is that normal? She's tense. Let me check she's not suffering from a psychological rejection of the implant. Okay. Tomorrow morning at 10! Keep it up, come on! Lucas, don't you want to meet up with Léopold? No, I don't. Antoine? Hey, there you are! Didn't we say nine p.m.? Yes, but I had to work late, and my phone died. I’m sorry, it's been a… It's okay. Would you open this for us? Everything's ready. I'm asking people on the darknet if they know anything about Joséphine. Friends. No, I can't believe it. She can't have left. They'll at least help me locate her. What are they doing? Hacking into anything they can. Surveillance cameras in the subway, at the airport, taxi bookings… And they haven't found anything? Not yet. I have to go. Don't worry, I'm keeping watch. If anything turns up, I'll let you know. Hey. Thank you. Let me see. Wait, it’s only natural. When you start out, you shouldn't draw heavy lines. On the contrary, draw very light ones, light strokes, so you can correct any mistakes. With your pencil, get a feel for the proportions, the shape, the outlines, to better express the statue's sensuality. You're a glutton for punishment. That's new. It's a new tattoo. We can do this. Give me a bit more time. Okay, let's go! Faster, faster! That's it, good. Great. Lift your legs higher, Nanou, higher, higher! The idea is to jump over them. Jumping fences is for horses. They jumped over them. Of course, they're mares. If you jump over all the fences, I'll read Flaubert. Everything he wrote? Let’s start with Madame Bovary. It seems one needs a degree in literature to have a conversation with you. So, you're planning on having conversations with me? Yes. I need to learn one or two names, but then I should be okay. It would be nice if you weren't so quick to judge me. Don't you want to say something because it's getting a bit awkward here. Sorry. It's just that usually, I'm the one being judged. I think you have to get jumping now. Madame Bovary? Madame Bovary! Why the hell did I mention Flaubert? …squats. Let's do 15, 15! Come on! Fourteen, 13, 12, 11, 10… Out straight. Keep your back straight. Nine, 8, 7... Hey, Marco! Can you come here, please? Are you nervous? It's the lunchtime rush. Nothing's ready. They're waiting to interview me. Is it all right? Don't move. Can't you stay? I have to get back. I really don't like interviews. Well, you'll have to get used to it or stop winning all these awards with your restaurants. Very funny! Let me remind you, it's also thanks to you and your talent that I’ve won. That's also why I love you. Antoine! Whenever you're ready! Right. Go for it. Okay? - Yes. - Okay? Esther, you have a notification from Tandor. It's about to locate Joséphine. Come on… give us a signal. Her transmitter has just stopped working. - Even the secondary signal? - Yes. She really doesn’t want to be found. There we go, this is your brain. And here, your hormone levels. It's fascinating. Does that reassure you? Yes. I had the feeling you could be inside my head, listen to me, see what I was seeing. No, actually, all we get are your constants, your hormone levels. They sometimes allow us to gauge your feelings. For example, your oxytocin levels were very high when you met Simon. What do you mean? Of all the beta testers, you're the one who got the highest rating on the attraction index. We'd never seen that before. So, if I have this right, you're always in my head? So, this thing is not just medical, it's a kind of emotional surveillance too. We only do it for the test. We won’t do it anymore afterwards. Listen, we don’t want you to feel monitored, Ana. So, if you have any problems, you come to me, okay? Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. - Martin? - Yes, Billie? Will Paul be here soon? He asked for a debrief this morning. His vehicle is nearly here. PAUL 2 MINS! Esther. How far have you gotten with the timings for finding a soulmate? Swann and I are working on it. We need 60 minutes, you know. I needed six months to finalize the system. We put the cart before the horse. We should have found investors first... What? - The cart before the horse! - Yes. And Paul? How is he? He's fine. Have you spoken to Joséphine recently? No. Why? What's going on? Fuck! What the hell is going on? I'll call security. - What's going on? - It's okay, Swann. I'll take care of this. - What the… - Martin, open the door. That’s impossible, Esther. - Security protocol activated. - Deactivate it, Martin. Fuck! Martin, open the door. Osmosis shatters your brain! You, turn that off! I told you to turn it off! OSMOSIS SHATTERS YOUR BRAIN Martin, open the door! Where the hell is she? Where is she? Where are you hiding her!? - Where is she? - Paul! - Where the hell is she? - Stop it! Mathieu Christo, Paul Vanhove has just violently assaulted one of your activists. As the president of Osmosis, a company that guarantees to find everyone a soulmate, don't you think that's rather ironic? A man who champions love but turns to violence just as easily? What's brilliant about Paul Vanhove and his sister's approach, is that they sell us a totalitarian project wrapped in the cutest packaging: love. Who is against love? The sole purpose of Osmosis is profit. But to benefit a few shareholders, what are we going to sacrifice? But you can't deny that this is a... Can you leave us for a second? Osmosis is not a revolution, it's a coup against humanity. Do you realize the deep shit you're getting us into? I don't know where she is. What? Who are you talking about? Joséphine. She's been taken, or she left, I don't know. Did you call the cops? They don't listen. Hold on, hold on. It can't be. Joséphine. Osmosis. Joséphine is Osmosis. If it doesn't work for her, then it won't work at all. Paul, we've known each other for 15 years, right? I'm here, what can I do to help? Nothing, don't worry. Don't worry. Esther will track her down. No, but she'll come back. It's just not possible, otherwise. I need to talk to you about the company. Can you handle it? Yes, yes, go ahead, I'm listening. We've got a huge cash flow problem. And with what's just happened, it’ll only get worse. We might have an opportunity. It's in the early stages. But they seem very interested. And they've got clout, it's a big organization with lots of money. Who are they? Here. It's the Mohicans group. They'd like you to talk to them about Osmosis. We have a meeting with them tomorrow. Can I count on you? Yes, yes, of course. Hi, Ana. How do you feel? Weird. I feel like I'm being watched all the time. Hello. A coffee, please. Anyway, they continuously receive my medical information, my hormone levels. I keep wondering: What if they're listening to me, or watching me? What you're doing for us is really important. Everything you say is true. It's the last great battle. We’ve reached a point where they really can colonize our brains. I... I need to feel useful. How are you getting on with infiltrating them? I met my soulmate. Do you think it works? I'd be surprised. He's a sports teacher. It's bullshit. Don't you like him? Yes, I do. So, it does work. I don't know. I… I'm attracted to him, yes. Excited, yes. But we've only spoken for a minute. You're a good person, Ana. As far as I’m concerned, you’re very important. This technology is monstrous, we're going to need your help. Are you ready? Yes. Good. What would you like me to do? Her blood pressure is up. Martin, show me the MRI. Her neuronal activity fell by 15% last night. It wouldn't be hard to make them work together. To insert my memory in the three implants, and make them converge on Mom's to activate her entire neuronal network. Martin, let’s do it. Esther, I need clear instructions. Encode my memories in Ana, Lucas and Niels' implants. Then combine the signals so they reactivate the TR-3 zone. Am I right in thinking you are authorizing me to break the rule against introducing external data into the beta testers? Yes. Authorization granted. The protocol states that Paul must approve any procedural changes regarding implants. ANY DECISION REGARDING... I've modified the protocol. - Are you connected to the three implants? - Affirmative. Then, go ahead, encode them. Anyway, thank you for inviting us, too. Hello. Samuel Kahn. I’m very pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Kahn. - Call me Samuel. Paul. Humans have always dreamt of controlling their fate. Warding off disease. Warding off death. Forecasting the weather. Predicting earthquakes. Controlling. What is Osmosis' crime? Making the most of one's life? Suppressing pain? Come on Samuel, we're the humanists. You'd even turn their own arguments against them? Have you found love, Samuel? You… What would you give to be sure? Really sure that it's her? That she'll always be there for you. That she won't leave you, that she won't be taken away from you? Osmosis responds to a huge demand. It will sell in the millions. I'm sure. But there are also a lot of more complicated elements, especially in the long-term. I'm talking about a… a fundamental need. Humanly fundamental. Esther? I've got her, I've found her. You're closer, I'll send you the GPS coordinates. Martin will guide you. Hey! Can you free the lab for me, I'll be there in 10 minutes. Ok, I'll sort that out. What about Paul, is he with you? No, he's gone to the police. They can't deny that she’s been kidnapped. We have another problem. The DA wants to open an investigation into Paul for assault. Shit. Yeah, the humanists have pressed charges. So, that crate of tomatoes is going to fill itself, is it? Hey! This is Antoine's order. It's important, isn't it? Shit. Is this because of your beta test? Yes. Yes, but you were right. Osmosis is an app. It's just an app. A kind of pseudo-magical thing that I expected way too much from. Antoine is my boyfriend. He loves me. I love him. It's real. I'll have the implant removed tomorrow. So, no more doubts? Well, no more, really no more. Lucas… It's complicated. Right, so you're still thinking about Léopold. You're an idiot. No algorithm can tell you how you feel. You've got to make up your own mind. So, talk to Antoine. Don't wait. No! No! No! Hey! All the serial numbers have been erased. Black light activated. They did a good job. We won't find anything. Still no signal from the phone? No. Joséphine's phone has gone completely silent. The implant too. We should at least get a signal from the battery. We're all traceable. Pandora? It's Theseus here. - Still working on your implants? - Yes. I have a question. It's been ages since I last went into a Faraday cage. How many are left in Paris? A box with electromagnetic shielding? Only one. Can you send me the address? It's already in your inbox. Great, thank you. Yes. Go ahead. I'd like a booth for an hour. Twenty euros. No phones, no tablets, no watches, no web-connected implants, no electronic circuits, no chips, nothing. Clients must respect the anonymity and privacy of the other clients. I know. If you require a computer, computer games, video equipment, sex toys, we can provide these. You are not to bring anything digital either in or out. I know. Would you like anything? Some popcorn? That said, it's good to see you. I heard your implant totally rocks. My girlfriend just dumped me, so I'm considering it. Hey! Hey! Hey!
