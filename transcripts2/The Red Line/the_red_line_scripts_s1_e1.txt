No, I-I could be sleeping for another hour. Well, maybe if you didn't disappear for hours at a time, we could talk about that. You know, I'm not exactly looking forward to today either. Can we just stay home and watch the news? I don't think sitting here and obsessing about federal charges is how we wanna spend our first day back. Just have to get through today, okay? [SIGHS] What if that cop gets off? No, we're not gonna go there until we have to. We are just going to school, okay? So please, just... get dressed. I can't get dressed until you move.

Hey, Benny, go get your backpack, okay? - [CHUCKLES] - We're leaving in 30 seconds. Whoa! You, uh... You still doing breakfast with the Honorable Nathan Gordon, Esquire? [CHUCKLES] Yes, I am. Hey. Competition just wanna get in your head 'cause he know you got him beat, a'ight? This time next year, I'm gon' be calling you Alderman Young. [CHUCKLES] ‭You jinx me, Ethan, I swear to God... All right. All right. Can I ask you a question real quick? I've been thinking about this for, like, six months. - Of course. - If you running for City Council, why the hell they call you "alderman"? Because... Chicago... we're complicated. Chicago, okay. Mm-hmm. Now go to sleep. ♪♪ FEMALE REPORTER: Chicago awaits official word today on whether or not the federal government will press charges against Officer Paul Evans in the shooting of an unarmed black doctor six months ago. Harrison Brennan, a surgeon, left behind a husband and teenage daughter. We expect word from the Department of Justice this afternoon at a press conference to be held at Federal Plaza. [PANTING] [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] What's funny? [SCOFFS] You look like a Kardashian. Yeah, that's not funny. It's kinda funny. [CHUCKLES] What's gonna happen today, Vic? Nothing. Today's the last day you're gonna have to worry about federal stuff. You know, a month from now, no one's gonna care about you or Harrison Brennan. I promise. Can't wait to change clothes. [SIGHS] You do eight last night? Yeah. I need the hours. All right, well, you just wanna go home and crash, that's okay. You've been babysitting me nonstop. Like I'm leaving your ass alone today. Let me buy you breakfast. [GEARS SHIFT] Thanks, Vic. Hey, Miss Jira. Hey, Mr. Bhatt. You and I gonna have fun this year? You teaching "The Great Gatsby"? No. No, my class is mainly cat videos while I sob quietly in a corner. We'll be good then. Mm-hmm. Sit up. [GASPS] They smell weakness, you are screwed. [SIPPING] Oh. Should I leave the second one, or... No, I think my heart would literally explode. [CHUCKLES] Hey, real quick. Yeah. So Jira's not the biggest fan of fiction. She's more of an A + B = C. - Don't take it personally. - I never do. She is in a place today. I got her back. Thank you. Anything I can do for you? Pretend I'm fine. I'm Kalen. Jira. I just wanna say that... I think what happened to your dad is, like, a complete injustice. Yeah, it was. I just want you to know there are people who understand. Excuse me. I need a hall pass. - Please. - Of course. Take as much time as you need, dear. [CLATTER] Famous Tia Young. [LAUGHS] Welcome to my home. So happy to have you. Thank you for the invitation. Well, so little time left to be cordial. The last leg of a campaign can be the most exhaustive time. Well, I don't know. It can't be more tiring than the first few months of being a mom. - How old is your boy? - Benny... he's almost 7. Oh, that's... that's a great time. - Here, help yourself. - Oh, thank you. At that age, you still think that you're perfect. [LAUGHS] No, I am the law, but his dad is perfect. Little boys love trains. I've been meaning to ask you, how is a girl with a master's in economics end up married to public transit? We grew up together. So you came back for him. I came back for my neighborhood. I was just lucky he was still here. Mm. That's very sweet. - [CHEWING] Come on. - [CLEARS THROAT] Genuine and dedicated... that's the impression you've made in the ward. But polling at 39%, you're not going to beat an incumbent in the 6th. [LAUGHS] Trying to school a risk analyst on statistics, hmm? I'm not trying to school you. I wanna hire you. This will be my last term on city council. I wanna groom my own successor. Who better than the fiercest opponent I've had in over a decade? I appreciate the compliment. There's no shame in stepping down. [SIPS] [CUP CLATTERS] Just... Come work with me within my administration. At the end of four years, there's an endorsement from me that comes with the weight of 30 years of service. That's very generous, Nathan. But? I'm not interested in joining the old guard. You're entrenched, and the way things have been isn't good enough anymore. All due respect, I'm not the one who should be dropping out of this race. [CHUCKLES] What do you think you're gonna be able to get done in your first four years without knowing anyone? Hmm? Well, do something about that $125 million you're about to spend on new police recruits. We don't need more of them. We need to train the ones we have. We need them not to cost us another $100 million every two years in lawsuits. - [CUP CLATTERS] - It's what we have to work with. Working with them instead of changing their ways is what got Dr. Harrison Brennan killed in a convenience store on his way home. I know you're not putting that on me. I know you know better than that. I put that on all of us. Give me four years to teach you. Make friends. Spend a little more time with Benny, hmm? [CHUCKLES] The working mother argument is beneath you, Nathan. I'm speaking from experience. You don't get that time back. I'm Jira. I was adopted from here in 2001. I've decided I'm ready to know who my birth mother is, please. Would you mind showing me some ID, Jira? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Good picture. [CHUCKLES] Thank you. Uh, I also have copies of my birth certificate and Social Security card if you need more forms of identification. I also have the introductory letter written to my mother as well as the forms from the website filled out. Whew. I wish everyone was as prepared as you. I've... I've thought about this for a long time. And I always do my homework. So why aren't you in school right now? Uh, this just seemed more important. I'm sure it does. So why do you wanna meet your birth mother? [CLEARS THROAT] Something... going on at home? No. I mean, not with... I know what you mean. No. I just need more family. Why do you need more family? I just do. You're 17, Jira. Until you're 18, a parent needs to request your records. I'm hoping you'll make an exception. That's not how it works. [VOICE BREAKING] There's no need to involve anyone else. She's my mom. I did the research, and... No. She gave birth to you. There's a difference. It's a big decision, and until you're an adult, it's one that you should make with the family that raised you, Ms. Calder-Brennan. Come back with your other dad, and we'll see what we can do. Ugh! Hawks are a damn disaster this year. Only team worse is Detroit. No way. Red Wings are gonna rally. We can still go to the Cup. Only bling that belongs in Detroit is on the front teeth of your citizens. I can't hear you over the Hawks losing to the Penguins. Who you like this year, Paulie? Uh, whoever can kick the crap out of the Penguins. Yeah. Hawks are gonna need someone who can shoot straight. - Yeah. - Maybe get a job with them, Paul. [CHUCKLES] That was dumb. I thought it would be funny... It was, man. It was. It's fine. I'm sorry, man. - Aah! - Jim, can you... - Can you not... - ‭[THUD] [GRUNTING] God. You can't just be hitting people, Jim. I don't wanna hear it. I'm done with everyone talking about you like, what, like they know? It was a crack. He made a joke. He's never been on the job! He has never been scared with a second to make a call! You know... You know what? I got enough on my plate without you throwing tantrums! You're not helping! I know what happens when you don't make that call. You got a little bit of ours back, brother. It was the wrong guy, Jim. You didn't know that. [DOOR OPENS] Hey. Boss just called. There's no voicemail. Quick rule, everyone. - When I am speaking, you are not. - [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [CONVERSATIONS STOP] Good morning. Happy new year. Welcome back to A.P. U.S. History. History is our story. You are the direct result of every decision ever made by every person who's ever come before you. We live in Chicago because Jean Baptiste Point du Sable once came upon this land, cold and empty, and thought, "I can make a home here," stood by that vast lake. They weighed their fear... and they stuck it out. And I want you to understand that person's hope. We are all the children of a million hopes, and it's our responsibility to act upon our own hopes. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Tyrant. What did you give them already that you have to grade? I made 'em journal over the summer. They are easier to break when you have a window into their souls. How you doing? I have got Angelica Barrett fourth period, so... Ahh. Do you want me to fight her? She'd eat you alive. I'd rip out enough hair to ruin prom. I'll consider it. No, but if she touches my hair, I'm out. Or my face. Thank you for defending my honor. [CHUCKLES] Anytime. Seen Jira yet? This morning in the hall. She's got her game face on. You both do. Think anyone's buying it? Mm... definitely. [P.A. ALERT TONE CHIMES] WOMAN: Mr. Calder, please report to the office. Mr. Calder, please report to the office. Daniel. School's off-limits, Elizabeth. You're not answering your phone. You break my rule, I break yours. I didn't wanna hear bad news. Is it good news? There's never gonna be good news. No charges for Paul Evans. [GASPS] The civil lawsuit is ready to be filed. They failed Harrison every way they can. It's time to make the city pay up. Daniel. I have to tell Jira before she finds out on her phone. [DOOR CLOSES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Come inside for a minute. Nothing's gonna happen to him, is it? No legal ramifications, no. Are we gonna sue? I think we should sleep on that. Why? Because... if we do, even if we win, it is the next four years of our lives. Is that what you want? Does he get to keep his job? I don't know. He probably will. It won't always be like this, I promise. [WHISPERS] Don't promise. ♪♪ - I need my suit. - Why? [GLASS CLATTERS] No... no charges. [GASPS] ♪ Then you just came along ♪ ♪ And I was helpless ♪ - [DOOR CLOSES] - [CHUCKLES] [BOTH SLURP] [GLASSES CLATTER] [PAUL RETCHING] Hey, I know today must be really hard. It's okay. You're holding on to a lot of negative energy, and it's getting directed at the people trying to help you. You need to let go of that. I need to let go of that? Yeah. Do not talk to me... ever. No phones, Jira. Let me see you in the hall. - I... - Now, please. - Miss Jira. - I'm going to the office, okay? Hey, you like baseball? Yeah. Cubs. What happens when a ball gets lost in the ivy at Wrigley? BEA MILLER: ♪ Wanna break all the clocks and the mirrors ♪ Outfielder raises his hands. Okay.

He was so happy to get that little girl. Wanted to name her Jira. He thanked me. I know. Would it have... Would it help her to... to meet me? - What, you're really asking? - Yes. I can... [SCOFFS] In the past, I haven't exactly been allowed an opinion on this. - I need you to. - T... [SIGHS] You know, I just... You sure this is about her? I just wanna do the right thing here. You did that when you gave her up. I get it if you wanna make sure she's okay. But that's about what you need. Maybe it is. Is that such a bad thing? I don't know. You still won't win this election. I could wait four years. I could be a mom. I-I could work with Gordon. You don't respect Gordon, and you know if anyone find out about her, that's all they gon' see... no more economics genius, just a hood rat who got pregnant at 15. Is that what I was? You know that's not what I meant. [KISSES] You only ever been a dream girl to me, baby. And you always saying you really wanna make a difference. Run for office, and you doing that already. - I'm her mom. - No. You're Benny's mom. I know that. Why can't I be both? Come on, Tia. Where you going? [KISSES] I'm going to the press conference. T.
