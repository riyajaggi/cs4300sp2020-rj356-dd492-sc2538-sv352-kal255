 Synced & corrected by Rambo Media Ltd Two weeks it's taken me to get a straight answer. - It's worse than India. - What is? The NHS. Anyway, I've got you an interview for you for a job in London. - And that's what I want is it? - Of course you do. It's a practice in Southall. Southall? Where's that? I don't know...it's London. How do you know things will be better in London? Oh, stop being so negative, it's tiresome.

 All you have to do is call them. We should've looked harder for Elwyn's diary when we had the chance. You turned the surgery upside down, it's not there. It is, I'm sure of it. It's only a matter of time before that Delhi doctor stumbles on it. Maybe he already has. - Why don't you just ask him? - What? Ask him if he's found the diary. You never know, he might just give it to you. Don't be absurd! Then he'd know how important it is. Would that matter? - Sylvia, if you ever have a thought, it would die of loneliness. - Oh, Dickie! There are no appointments at all today.

 The last two weeks have been so busy. Everyone's had a good gawk at you, look at you. The only people you'll see in here from now on are the ones that are sick. So what are they saying about me? These people who've had a good gawk at me? Do you really want to know? According to my nan, Mrs Rees is worried you might be a bit young. But Miss Roberts thinks you're nice, and not nearly as posh as you seem. - Posh? - It's the way you talk. - Oh. Mrs Jenkins thinks you're much cleverer than Dr Elwyn, but she never really liked Dr Elwyn. And Miss Morgan says you're not nearly as dark as she expected. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Why not? - Well, it's...it's prejudiced. - Is it? I don't know, I don't think so. - No? - What else are they saying? - Erm... Oh, yes, Mrs Bevan said she could hardly wait to get round my nan's after she saw you. She said... - I'm not sure I should tell you what she said. - What? She said she thinks... that you're really tidy. Tidy? I don't understand. You know, tidy? Cracking. She fancies you. Mm... Oh! I wouldn't worry, she's 81. There seem to be a lot of talk about me. They've got nothing else to talk about. - Have you called the people in London yet? - Er, no. - Are you going to? - Yeah, when I have time. They're expecting you to call. And I will when I have time. Time is the one thing we're not short of here. Well, I could make some house calls? - You might as well have the day off. - Really? It's a beautiful day. Makes no sense sitting inside. Dr Elwyn never gave me the day off. Tidy! FOOTSTEPS Get in. Get in! Morning. Morning. Who's that? - The whipper-in. - The what? If they catch you mitching, they whip you in to school. Perhaps this place isn't so backward after all. - You're Owen Griffith's son aren't you? - Maybe. Don't worry, I won't turn you in. I hated school myself. Complete waste of time. - Do you want to make some money? - For what? - Nothing difficult. Right up your street in fact. - What? Dr Elwyn kept a diary in his surgery, a green leather diary with a leather cord around it. Do you think you could find it and bring it to me? How much? Good lad. - Mrs Evans. - Dr Sharma. I didn't put in for a house call. No, no. I was just passing. I thought I'd check in on your husband now he's home. He's sleeping. - Good. The more rest he gets the better. - Yeah, he's fine. Good. See you some other time. Yeah. - What's he trying to do? - He's being thoughtful. - No he's not. - Well, I thought it was nice. - Is that a new dress? - What? No. - It's a bit bright isn't it? - No. I think it is. It's summer, Tom. MUSIC PLAYS RECORD STICKS SHE SIGHS Perfect. - Good morning. - Morning, Doctor. Hey! Hey! - You're the doctor? - Yes. - You have to come. - What? - It's Gwyneth. It's her time. - Her time? She's going into labour and something's wrong. He's always round our house. It's like he's got nothing better to do. He's only checking in on your dad. - He spends more time with Megan than he does with my dad. - Really? I don't see why we can't just stick with Dr Morgan. At least he's Welsh. Dr Sharma's all right. He gave me the day off. Did he? You want to go somewhere? - Where? - I don't know. - Anywhere. - OK. Come on, Doc! Is that everything? - Yes. - You don't want the Marmite? - I'm sorry? - The Marmite? - Oh, no. - Right. Could you order in an Indian paper for me? - The Hindustan Times? - The what? - The Hindustan Times. - What is that? It's a paper. - Foreign paper? - Yes, it's Indian. - No. Don't do that. - Do you carry The Times? Bridgend Times, The Pontypridd Observer, or the Western Examiner. No. Thank you. Right. - COW MOOS - It's a cow? She's a cow. Why didn't you call a veterinarian? Vets are expensive, Doc. NHS? Well, it's free. NHS is for people. Please, Doc. Gwyneth, she's like family to me, Doc. Do you want to abandon Gwyneth in her hour of need? COW MOOS I've never delivered a cow. But you could, you could. It's all the same way...basically. I've brought you hot water and towels, Doc. Not sure we'll be needing the towels. Did you remember an apron? Right, let's get stuck in. Right. Yes. Stuck in. Yes... CLATTERING Who let you in here? No-one. And what exactly do you think you're doing? - What's wrong? - I thought you were going to hit me? Hit you? Why would I do that? Everyone does. Well, I'm not everyone. I can't thank you enough, Doc. I thought Gwyneth was a goner there. And the little one. Provided they're dealt with, breech births aren't serious. I'm sure the baby will be... The... - Calf, Doc. Calf. - Much obliged. The calf will be absolutely fine. I'll tell you what, I'm going to name the little one after you. Little Dr Sharma. - Are you going to take me to the police? - No. Why not? - What for? - Because I broke into your house. You didn't break in. The window was open. - Yeah, but... - And you didn't do any damage. A bit of iodine on the floor... I was trying to steal from you! - Is that what you were doing? - Yeah! I expect you were just bored. I wasn't bored. It was a job. I was getting paid and everything. What was it, a bet? - One of your friends? - No! Some girl you were trying to impress? It was Mr Sharpe! He paid me to steal your diary. I don't have a diary. Well, someone's diary. A green leather diary. Well, then, we'd better pay a visit to your Mr Sharpe. And any time you want a pint of milk, Doc, just pop round. That's very kind. Is this your car? - Piece of junk. - What model is it? Prefect '53. You like cars? No...I LOVE cars. I learnt to drive in a Hindustan Ambassador. Could never afford one, though. Prefect, nice name. Ah...that way? That way. Down the hill, across the field, over the stile, footpath, village. - Good day. - Good day. ♪ Only the lonely, only the lonely - ♪ Only the lonely - Dum, dum, dum, dum di do ah - ♪ The way I feel tonight - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - ♪ Only the lonely - Dum, dum, dum, dum di do ah ♪ Know this feeling ain't right... ♪ All I've ever wanted to do is sing for people. When I sing, I feel like I'm on fire. Well, no, not on fire. But, like, really, really alive. - Don't get nervous when people are watching you? - No, why? I would. That's the best bit. I think you're amazing. Me too. Gina? Dr Sharma? What are you doing here? Tom. I'm trying to get to the village. I keep seeing it, I just can't seem to get there. We could give you a ride in the van. Couldn't we, Tom? Sure. What? HE CHUCKLES Nothing, nothing. Funny day. ♪ If your lonely heart breaks - ♪ Only the lonely - Dum, dum, dum, dum di do ah. ♪ Did he say why he wanted this diary? No. He just said what it looked like and he'd give me five bob if I found it. - Got you! - Ah! - Don't you dare hurt that child! - No, you don't! - Who do you think you are? Let go of him! - This boy's a truant. He's supposed to be in school. - No, he is not. - What? - He's not supposed to be in school. - Oh, and why not? Because I'm teaching him. - What? - I'm giving him private tuition. - And you can do that? - Of course I can. I've never heard of this before. - And you call yourself an educationalist? - No, a welfare officer. So, you've never heard of Bertrand Russell, AS Neill, Wilhelm Reich? - Are they in the Cardiff office? - What? I only know Pontypridd. It doesn't matter. The point is, the child is with me. - Fancy sending grown men out in the streets to attack children. - I did not attack him. Now, we've had enough interference and we'd like to get on with our lesson. Good day. I'm going to check on this. Ridiculous little man. No wonder you don't want to go to school. You're not going to give me lessons, are you? Of course not, I just need you with me when I speak to Mr Sharpe. You repeat everything you told me. - OK. - Anyway, I wasn't going to let him beat you. How barbaric, the English are supposed to be civilised. - He's Welsh. - English, Welsh - what difference does it make? Oh! Can I help you, Mrs Evans? Dr Sharma. Yes, please. You're a...you're a musician? Not me, no. Those are Tom's. - Your son? - Stepson. Ah, of course. I didn't think you looked old enough to have a teenage son. He's singing in a talent contest at the pub tomorrow. You should come, it'll be fun. He just gave me a lift back to the village. Tom? Where were you? Some farm up in the hills. I performed my first delivery. A baby? Whose? Gwyneth Joseph's. Ceri Joseph's cow. - I delivered a calf! - I didn't think doctors did that. It was a first. Why didn't he get the vet? Apparently vets are too expensive. Ah, yes. That would be Ceri! - That's my wife. - You liar, you did. Mrs Sharma, I haven't the foggiest idea what this boy is talking about. You paid this child to break into my house and steal from me. - He would say anything to get himself out of trouble. - He's not lying. He's really does have the most inventive imagination. - Should be locked away, he should. - The only person who should be locked away is you, Mr Sharpe. - You're a liar and a thief. - Oh, jiw jiw! Kamini? He paid this child to break into our house and I'd like to know why. Dr Sharma. I'm sorry, but your wife appears to be labouring under some dreadful misunderstanding. - There's no misunderstanding. - This appalling child has filled her head with a lot of nonsense. - It's not nonsense! - Kamini! You and your good lady wife are guests in our country - and the way this boy is taking advantage of that... - Do you take me for an idiot? - Kamini, please! - The man is lying. If you don't believe me we can ask the boy. Dan? Dan! I'm afraid he really can't be trusted. It's you who can't be trusted. What are you doing? - You're making a scene. - I'm not going anywhere. You're acting like a child. Poor woman. It must be hard, being so far from home. That sort of behaviour might be acceptable where she comes from, but it certainly isn't here. - What happened? - It's the Griffiths boy, I'm afraid. Up to his usual tricks. I see you've been out walking with the doctor. What? - No, we just bumped into each other... - I don't blame you. Lovely day for it. I can't believe you said that. - You called him a liar and a thief! - Because he is! - According to a child. Why would a man like Sharpe pay a child to break into my office? Do you think I made all this up? You do? You don't trust me. It doesn't make any sense! How dare you? I have never lied to you about anything. I didn't say that you lied. So you're not going to do anything? I'll speak to the boy's father. If he doesn't know anything, you can get drunk with him. - That happened once. - You spend more time with these people than you do with me. I am their doctor. I have to win their trust. That's a struggle without you picking fights. - I didn't. - And embarrassing me in front of the whole village. That's what I am then? An embarrassment to you? ♪ Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams ♪ The whole day through ♪ Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams ♪ Night time too. ♪ Are you going to sing that the contest tomorrow night? Do you want me to? I don't know. I'm not sure I like the idea of you singing to all those girls. I'll be singing to them but I'll be thinking of you. WINDOW OPENS Gina, is that you? If my nan knew I was kissing a boy on her doorstep, she'd kill me. We could go back to my house. Megan's out all night and my dad never comes downstairs. Not yet, Tom. Soon though. Tom just gave me a lift home. Tom... Mrs Davies. Just going. Five quid. HE COUNTS QUIETLY We're ready. Rum. I don't know why he plays. He always loses. Can I get you a pint, Doctor? That's all right. It's my round. I'm fine thank you, Doctor. That was a pretty big loss there. You sure you can afford it? How can anyone afford anything these days? What was it you wanted to ask me? Did Dr Elwyn keep a diary? Elwyn? He kept loads of diaries. Do you know where they are? Would you like me to show you? Always writing, he was. His thoughts about the village, things people told him, gossip, bit of local colour. Aye, very proud of being Welsh, was Dr Elwyn. Put them all here in the institute library. There's one for every five years, all the way back to the 30s. Any particular one you're after? Where's the current one? Probably still writing that one when he died. Must be back in the surgery somewhere. Does your son know about these? Dan? Not likely. He and books aren't exactly best mates. - What about Mr Sharpe? - Mr Sharpe? The only thing that interests him in the Valleys is how quickly he can get out of them. - Can anyone come here? - Any time you like. But not now. Your round! I'd love to, but I have to get home. Perhaps some other time. Kamini? You were right. I spoke to Owen Griffiths. He showed me a whole shelf full of Elwyn's old diaries. They were just like the one you described. Which means the boy couldn't have made it up. Which is what you said. - I should have believed you. I'm sorry, it just didn't seem right. - I don't care. What matters is that you didn't trust me. Kam... Griffiths! Owen Griffiths! Ma' Sharpe ishe gwel' Owen Griffiths. - WHISTLING - Sharpe wants to see Griffiths! I'm on my way. I heard you lost again last night. Your bad luck at poker is hardly a secret, Griffiths. How much was it this time? - None of your business. - That sounds like a lot. Was it your money or did you have to...? It was my money. I suppose, though, you taking money from the Miners' Welfare Fund isn't technically wrong. I mean, you being a miner - and it being for your welfare. - I did that once. And I'm going to pay it back. - Not if you keep losing. - What do you want? The Indian doctor came to see you. Yes. So? - What did he want? - He just wanted to talk. About what? Politics, Gandhi, South Africa... we have a lot in common. And that was it? He didn't talk about his wife? His wife? No. Or Elwyn? No. Why? I just don't want him making trouble. Trouble for who? You? I know you don't like me, Griffiths, and that's fine. The only thing I care about is the productivity of this mine. So you can get in with the area manager. If that's what you want to think, yes. But understand this... ..if productivity stays up, the mine stays open. Do you have any idea how many pits in this area are going to close over the next few years? - Yes. - Without the mine, this village will die. So bear that in mind. He's singing in the talent contest tonight at the club. I'm sure he'll win. He's got such lovely eyes. Can I tell you a secret? He's a gorgeous kisser too. I could kiss him all day. In fact, I did. I can't believe I just told you that. If my nan could hear me now, she'd lock me in my room and throw the key away. - Hear you say what? - Nothing. There's absolutely nothing wrong with your heart. - It's very strong. - It must be the worry then. If it's not one thing it's another. People take the most awful liberties. It gives me palpitations. Perfectly normal. Nothing to worry about. You'd be amazed at the things some people do in my shop. - PHONE RINGS - I'm sure I would. Hello? Hello? Mummy? Operator? That's the third time. How did these people run an empire? How much is this costing? I haven't spoken to my mother in two weeks. She'll be fine. She's got your father to nag. - It was a joke. - It's not funny. I'm going out of my mind here and you won't even let me speak to my mother. I didn't say you... Kamini! - Gina, do you know anything about a diary? - Diary? Did Dr Elwyn keep a diary in the surgery? I don't know. Mr Sharpe seems to think so. Apparently he's looking for it. - Oh yeah, I heard about that. - I'm sure everyone in the village has. I looked everywhere I could think of last night, and this morning. It's probably none of my business. You're the right sort of person, aren't you? You're a good person. I hope so. Dr Elwyn made me swear this wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. It's in Welsh. - Have you read it? - I can't speak much Welsh. Do you know anyone who could translate it for me? My nan could. Someone discreet? Oh, I see what you mean. If we give it to my nan it'll be round the whole village by tea time. - Is there anyone else? - Not really. None of my friends speak much Welsh either. DOOR OPENS - Excuse me, are you here to see the doctor? - No. Excuse me! Mrs Sharma! I was thinking maybe you could give me lessons, like you said. That was before you ran off and left me with Mr Sharpe. - What's this? - It's perfume. It makes you smell nicer. - I know what it is. Why are you giving it to me? - To say I'm sorry. - Did you steal it? - No, it's my mother's. Doesn't she want it? - I don't know. - Did you ask her? I haven't seen her since I was eight. My father's never going to use it, so you might as well have it. Thank you. No, no, no. That means absolutely no alcohol, not even for medicinal purposes. - Thanks, Doc. - Don't forget that phone call. Mrs Sharma said you had to make a phone call. These are all from your mother? And you've never read them? - Bits of them. - So you can read. Go on then. - Were you a teacher in India? - No. - Then how come you know so much? Because I read a lot. I thought you wanted me to teach you. Let's do that later. You read it. No. Come on, stop being lazy. - I'm not lazy. - Then stop wasting time and read it. - No. - Why not? Because I don't like reading. - Don't be stupid. - I'm not stupid and I'm not lazy. - You're just like everyone else. - Dan! I didn't mean what I said. And I don't really think you're stupid. Actually, I think you're quite clever compared to most of the people around here. The other day someone asked me if I lived in a mud hut. Do I look like I could live in a mud hut? You look like you should live in a palace. I wish I did. I am stupid, though. Everyone says so. Because you can't read? - How did you know? - It's pretty obvious. Hasn't anyone tried to help you? They try, and then they get angry with me because I can't do it. Dr Sharma? Sorry to disturb you. It's Ceri Joseph. He wants to speak to you but he's a bit embarrassed. - Oh, no! What is it this time? It's not a pig, is it? - No, no. He feels terrible about yesterday. - Tell him it's fine. - He wants to thank you. He has something he wants to give you. There's really no need. It would mean a lot if you let him thank you. Fine. - A pint of milk, is it? - Not exactly. I was up all night, Doc, and I finally got her working. Now she's purring like a little kitten. - I can't possibly accept this. - Why not? It's the point of the NHS. It's free at the point of care. Ah! For people. The NHS is free for people. But cows - a different matter. Yes, but... No, I really can't. Look, uh... I'll give you ã10 for it. - It's worth 30. - What? - If not more. - But... - All right. Doc, for Gwyneth's sake, I'll let you have her for ã25. - You want me to give you ã25 for your car? - 20. - 20? - Done. I don't have the money on me. Don't worry, Doc. You pay me when you can. You couldn't possibly give me a lift back? I don't like leaving Gwyneth on her own for too long. Ceri. Ma fe'n rhy fishi. So fe'n gallu bratu'i amser yn dy redeg di ambythdi. - Fydd e ddim wincad. - A shwd ma fe'n mynd i ffindo'i ffordd gatre o'ch lle chi? - Dere di 'da ni... Elli di weud 'tho fe. Na 'lle di? - It's a long way round by road. - It's not easy to find your way back. - That I know. Mrs Evans is coming with us to show you the way back. - You don't mind? - No, not at all. - Great! Give me a chance to take her for a spin. I'll get my hat and coat. We made a deal. I read one letter and then you read one letter. It's your turn. That's not what we said. It is, Dan. You read a letter, then I try to read a letter. I've tried. It's your turn. Mrs Sharpe's downstairs. What does she want? - Well, all the best, Doc. - Thank you. I still don't understand how he got me to pay for this. - You were the one who mentioned money. - He didn't have to bargain. I was just being polite. - Of course he had to bargain. - Why? Pride. What's so funny? Nothing. People from the Valleys may seem all warm and simple, but there are no flies on us. - ENGINE STARTS - Oh! Woo-hoo-hoo! - Dickie felt really awful about yesterday. - Did he? He can be such a brute sometimes. He doesn't mean to be. Between you and me, I don't think he understands women. No. He was very upset, though, about all that business with the boy. - It's fine. The boy was obviously lying. - Really? I'm sure. I'm so sorry about him. He's a disgrace to the village. - What you must think of us... - It's fine. I've forgotten all about it. Mind you, the rest of them aren't much better. Very small minded. It's been really hard for my Dickie. The things people have said to us. Even Dr Elwyn. Oh, yes. In many ways he was the worst. A terrible racialist. He was horrible to Dickie just because he's English. God knows what he would have made of you. Aww. I bet you never imagined Britain would be like this. No, I didn't. - Oh. You gave me a fright. - I didn't lie to you. I said that because the less she knows, the better. That woman must think I'm really stupid. Because you're Indian? Probably. I think Indians are really clever if they're all like you. They're not, any more than all Welsh people are as stupid as Mrs Sharpe. ENGINE SPUTTERS AND STOPS ENGINE WHINES No wonder he wanted to give it away. I don't think he was trying to cheat you. Right, excuse me. What are you doing? It's not going to fix itself. You can do that? You're not a man unless you know your tappets from your pistons. Ooh, Doctor! - You speak Welsh. - What? That was Welsh you were speaking with Mr Joseph, wasn't it? Ah, yes. Might I ask a favour? No, I don't know anything about cars. No, not this. I've got this diary that Dr Elwyn left in his surgery. I'm quite curious as to what's in it, but it's in Welsh. - Do you want me to have a look at it? - Would you? - Of course. - The thing is, I think Mr Sharpe's is trying to get hold of it, and Dr Elwyn did want to keep it a secret. So mum's the word. You sure you don't mind? It'll give me something do while I'm looking after Gareth. Why would Mr Sharpe want one of Dr Elwyn's diaries? I have no idea. ♪ Take good care of my baby ♪ ♪ Please don't ever make her blue. ♪ I'm so sorry. Yes, Mr Powell did say he should call straight away and I did tell him... I know. He has been very busy... I'm sure he meant to call. I'm sure you are, I appreciate that. I know you've gone to so much trouble. As soon as he gets back I'll... Are you sure? Mr Powell's... I understand. LINE GOES DEAD OK, give it a try. ENGINE REVS Triumph! I'm impressed. I haven't played with an engine in ages. Better than fixing people? Cars do exactly what the doctor ordered. - Right. Home? - Can you take me to the pub? - If I don't get there before Tom sings he'll never forgive me. - Let's see what this baby can do. ♪ Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams ♪ The whole day through ♪ Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams ♪ Night time too I love you and I'm dreaming of you ♪ But that won't do ♪ Dream baby, make me stop my dreaming ♪ You can make my dreams come true. ♪ Maybe Elwyn got rid of the diary. Well whatever he did with it, it's not there. And if the Sherpas haven't found it by now they never will. - Sharma. - What? Sharma. Their name is Sharma. Stupid name. You're sure she believed you about the boy? She didn't have a clue. She's not as clever as she thinks she is. Good. So do I get a reward for being your clever little girl? There's a rumour going round about an area manager's job in Nottingham. - Really? - Yes. And my name's been mentioned. Dickie! We could move to England. - Yes. - Get a posh new house. - A new car. - Start a family. - Ow, that hurts! - It's supposed to feel nice. - Well, it doesn't. What would you like to do? Would you like to give it a go or take the money? Always take the money. ♪ Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams ♪ The whole day through ♪ Dream baby, got me dreaming sweet dreams ♪ Night time too ♪ I love you and I'm dreaming of you ♪ But that won't do ♪ Dream baby, make me stop dreaming ♪ You can make my dreams come true... ♪ DOOR CLOSES SNORING ♪ Sweet dream baby ♪ How long must I dream? ♪ Kamini. Guess what I've just bought. I paid a little more than I expected to... What? All you had to do was make one phone call. Have you any idea how humiliated I felt? Enoch is a friend of Daddy's, and that job is gone now. There's nothing wrong with this job. Everything is wrong with it! That's why we were going to London. - I never said I wanted to go to London. - That's the problem. You never say anything. That's what you do, Prem. We don't belong here. I want to go. Aren't you going to say anything? I'm...I'm going to bed. If there is a health problem at the mine, - I'm sure the Coal Board is aware of it. - I don't think they are. If they aren't, then we've got to tell them about Sharpe. - I told you to get Elwyn's diary for me. - I couldn't find it. So you decided to tell the doctor's wife all about our little deal. - Hey! - It's about my boy. Go home, Griffiths. It's too late now. Synced & corrected by Rambo Media Ltd
