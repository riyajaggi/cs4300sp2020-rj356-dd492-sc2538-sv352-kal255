 The Indian Doctor (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 5 - The Fete - full transcript 
 Sharpe learns that he has been promoted to area manager in Nottingham but turns on his wife Sylvia for asking Prem for advice over his impotence. Prem and Kamini,despite learning that the miners submitted to X-rays,also consider moving - back to India,as they believe they do not fit in in Trefelin. However,when Dan runs off with the diary,Kamini locates them and brings them home and Prem persuades Dan's father Owen to back up the diary's contents by telling a local journalist of Sharpe's transgressions at the village fete. Other miners are quick to testify and Sylvia broadcasts her husband's little problem to the whole village. Gina tells Tom that she is pregnant and is not rejected. Prem suggests to his now totally supportive wife that they should stay in Trefelin - at least until they get the X-ray results.

 Synced & corrected by Rambo Media Ltd According to Elwyn, Sharpe has been breaking every safety regulation there is, and has been for years. The coal dust in the mine is worse than anyone ever remembers. - The first thing is to find out exactly how many miners have got lung disease and how bad it is. - How? Simple. Chest x-rays. I don't anyone going near that van. Understand? Not one miner gets his chest x-rayed. - What am I supposed to tell them? - Tell them it was my idea. - Then they'll be against it! - Exactly. There's only one reason why Dr Sharma brought that x-ray van to our village. To help you, all of you. He's not a company doctor. We should go.

 Leave the village? I told you to get Elwyn's diary. And I'll get it. MUSIC: "Stay" by Maurice Williams & The Zodiacs You may have won last year, Ceri Joseph, but I think my little sweetheart may have a surprise or two for you tomorrow. You say that every year and you never win. - I do. - Not unless you cheat. - Now don't start all that. - It's not me that starts it. Mr Griffiths? Are you all right? - Have you seen my boy? - Dan? No. - He's not with Mrs...er...Sharma? - I don't know. Why? Is something wrong? He's disappeared.

 He's always disappearing. That's what he does. No. This is different. He's never gone like this before. Is he in trouble? I have to find him. If you see him, tell me. You are looking at the new area manager for Nottingham. Your promotion? - It's official. - Oh, Dickie! I can't believe we're finally going to get out of this miserable little village. Ha-ha! What about Sharma's x-rays, they won't cause us a problem, will they? - No, the poor fool who succeeds me will have to deal with them. - And that silly diary... The diary, yes, a little bit of unfinished business there, but that's in hand, I think. I think today look sets to be rather splendid. - Dickie? - What? Seeing as you're a big area manager now, why don't we celebrate? - What are you after? - Nothing. - I just thought we'd go upstairs. Maybe fool around a little. - Sylvia! - It's first thing in the morning. - So? I haven't got time for this nonsense. You never have time. I have to go to work. And you never want to go upstairs. Why can't you just admit you've got a problem? It's nothing to be ashamed of, Dickie. Dr Sharma says it happens to lots of men. What?! It's normal. And there are things you can do. You told Sharma? It just sort of slipped out. You told that Indian what goes on in our bedroom? Nothing goes on in our bedroom! How dare you discuss my private life! - Ow! I'm sorry. - Who do you think you are, Sylvia? Please... I said I'm sorry. You will be. If you ever mention this ever again, to anybody, you'll be out on the street so fast your feet won't touch the ground. - Morning. - Morning, Gina. It's good about the miners, isn't it? - What is? - Having their x-rays done. Didn't you know? Megan Evans went down the pub last night and had a good old shout at them. - She marched them all up to the x-ray van. - All of them? I think so. I'm glad I wasn't there. You do not want to see her bad side. I can imagine. Gina? Have a seat. Your results have come back. I'm pregnant, aren't I? According to the tests, yes. Have you told anyone? - You're going to have to, you know. - I know. You should tell your grandmother. I can't. She'll kick me out. I'm sure she won't. She kicked my mother out when she got pregnant with me. I don't know where I'll go. I can still keep my job, can't I? It won't be up to me, I'm afraid. - Why not? - I won't be here. Mrs Sharma and I are going back to India. Oh. It's you. What are you doing here? My son's disappeared. When did you last see him? Last night, - this morning... - You're drunk, aren't you? You are a father. There are plenty of people who would give anything to have children. What's going on? - Dan's gone. - He's run away. I thought he might have come to you. - Why? - He's talked about your missus... Mrs Sharma. I've looked everywhere, doctor. - Have you been to the police? - No. Why not? - I can't. - Owen if you and Dan are in some sort of trouble, then we can try to help you. But you have to tell us what's happened. Why don't you step into my office? Come. Tom? What do you want? I thought we could talk? What about? Not here, my nan. Do you want to go somewhere? - I can't. - Just for a minute. - I'm working. - When you finish. No, I have to meet someone in Ponty... a man from London. - About your singing? - Probably won't come to anything. Can I come with you? No, it wouldn't look right. It's been hard, bringing up Dan on my own, and working too. I'd have a pint and a game of cards. That's how it started. But it got out of hand. I've no idea how I lost so much. I do. I've seen you play. Whatever you tell me in here is confidential. All right. There's a Welfare Fund for the miners. I borrowed some money from the fund to pay my debts. And? I meant to pay it back, honestly. But I kept falling behind with the rent and Dan needed things. - I see. - And then... Sharpe found out. He's blackmailing you? He wants me to give him the diary. If I don't, he'll ruin me. You have Dr Elwyn's diary? Megan showed it to me. - And I took it. - You stole it? Sharpe forced me. - He doesn't own you. - He does. Owen, do you have any idea how important that diary is? It's the one thing that can stop Sharpe from putting more lives at risk. If he's blackmailing you, it will never stop. You have to stand up to him. Where's the diary now? I don't know. I had a lot to drink. When I woke up it was gone. Gina. Are you all right? Not really. Why? What's wrong? Is Tom avoiding me? No, I don't think so. Has he said anything? About us? You need to speak to him, Gina. I can't. This is the worst day of my life. It can't be that bad. It is. I've lost my job, my boyfriend won't talk to me... You lost your job? I will. When Dr Sharma goes. What? Where's he going? Back to India. Megan? Where do you want the rest of the stalls? Goddess costs a bit more than the others but it's worth it. Mmm. My granddaughter swears by it. It's good for greasy hair? - She says it is. - Lots of body? - Plenty of bounce? - Oh, yes. All the girls love it. I've only got a couple of bottles left. I'll take them both. What can I do for you, Mr Joseph? Well, I'm hoping you can help me, Mrs Davies. I'm looking for a very good shampoo. Something a... bit special, if you know what I mean. How funny. So was Mr Dawkins. He's just taken my last two bottles of Goddess. - Has he? - Yes, just now. I could order some in for you? No. Would you like something else? No. I'll be fine. Thank you. - Busy? - Just doing some paperwork. Did you hear about the miners getting their x-rays? Yes, well done. You succeeded where I failed. We succeeded, it was your idea. They didn't take my word for it. I saw Owen Griffiths. Oh? He was looking for Dan. There's nothing new there then! Why did you show him the diary? Because I thought that he should know what Sharpe was really like. Sharpe asked him to steal it. Oh. He says he's lost it, but for all I know he's probably given it to Sharpe. But we will have the x-ray results back in a couple of weeks. And they will probably tell us that some of the miners have lung disease. But it's the diary that links it all to Sharpe. Without the diary, Sharpe gets away scot free. I'm sure we can... Megan, it's not my fight, it never was. It's yours, the miners, the villagers, not some Indian doctor who happened to be passing through. Is that why you're leaving? No. But it's made me realise that we just don't fit in here. Maybe we don't belong here. Not everyone feels like that. Seems that way. I don't. Oh, Mrs Sharma. I was just telling Mrs Evans that we'll be leaving by the end of the week. Then you'll get the doctor you deserve. I hope you come to the fete. You might find more friends there than you realise. Goodbye. What is she doing here? She just came to say that all the miners have had their x-rays taken. Good, then the next doctor can deal with the results. It's not our problem any more. - Where are you going? - I think I know where to find Dan Griffiths. - Where? - I can't tell you. I promised the boy I wouldn't tell anyone. Besides, if you came with me it might scare him off. A bit over there, just do it, man. Oh, Megan! - Megan. He's at it again. - What? Emlyn Dawkins. He's cheating. He does it every year. - Ceri. I don't care. - Well, it's not a fair contest. It's a beauty contest, Ceri! It doesn't matter! - It matters to me. - Well, it doesn't matter to me! There are more important things in life than this stupid fete. Dan? Dan? Dan? - You can't have that. - Oh! You scared the life out of me. - Give it to me. - You look awful. Are you all right? Come here. No. I mean it. Everyone's worried sick about you. You're freezing. Have you read that? - You know I can't read something this difficult. - But you took it. So Mr Sharpe can't have it. I hate him. He spoils everything. Come on. Let me take you home. To my house. I wish you was my mam. Dr Sharma says it might be a while before we get another doctor. Apparently there's a real shortage. I'll be out of a job if we don't get a new one. And what makes you think you'll have a job even if we do get a new doctor? I know that job like the back of my hand. How long do you think you can carry on working with that? What? Were you ever going to tell me? Or did you think I wouldn't notice? I wasn't born yesterday, Gina. Have you thought what you're going to do when this baby comes? How you're going to get by? Where you're going to live? Are you going to kick me out? Can you think of any reason why I shouldn't? Right, then. We'll show them, won't we? Yes, let's show them. Yes! You're a good girl, aren't you? Go up. I'll be there in a minute. - What's going on? - I told him he could stay. - I couldn't leave him where he was. - Why didn't you take him home? He won't go home. - We're not his parents. - So? - And we're leaving. - Not tonight, we're not. Emlyn Dawkins thinks he's so clever taking that last bottle of shampoo. But there's more than one way to skin a cat. Oh, yes. Now then, Gladys. Let's make you look beautiful. (singing in Welsh)  Calon lan yn llawn daioni (singing in Welsh) Tecach yw na'r lili dlos... Well, I'm sorry to hear you're leaving. - I'm sure you'll be missed. - Perhaps. As it happens I'm leaving myself, in a few days. I've been promoted to area manager. Perhaps we should make a joint announcement at the fete tomorrow? No, I don't think we will be doing that. - Is there anything else you wanted? - Right. Oh, one more thing. Will you be passing Dr Elwyn's diary on to your successor? That's not my decision. Ah, yes. Megan Evans has it. Or does she? I wouldn't know. Oh, dear. Do I take it that whole situation's become a bit tricky? - What situation? - Is that why you're leaving? Did Mrs Sharma find out about your bit of crumpet? My what? Or has Mrs Evans tired of her little exotic fling? I think you'd better leave. Perhaps she's realised how disgusted people are with her behaviour. And yours. Mr Sharpe, as a doctor it's my duty to uphold the wellbeing of every single person in this village, but I'm sure it doesn't apply to a cockroach such as yourself. Do you think your silly little insults bother me? Probably not. But I wonder if being exposed for theft, perjury and, who knows, manslaughter might wipe that smile from your face. I'd be very careful what you say, doctor. This is Britain, our laws require proof, and if I'm not mistaken, without that diary you have no proof and without proof you have nothing. You are an immoral, corrupt little man, Mr Sharpe, and sooner or later it will catch up with you. Well, that's a possibility but I'm afraid you're missing one vital factor, I don't care! God speed with your packing. - Where did you get this? - From Dan. Have you read this? - Yes. - I never trusted Sharpe, but this... He's getting away with murder. It's a disgrace. The whole world should know what he's been up to. Come. Let's not disturb him. What did you just say? I don't want to disturb him. He's exhausted. No. About Sharpe. He's a disgrace. Everybody should know what he's been doing. Yes, they should. MUSIC: "Oh! Carol" by Neil Sedaka Very nice. Much better than I expected. And don't forget your tickets for the raffle. The more tickets you buy, the more chances you've got. All the money goes to the Miner's Welfare Fund, so if you want to support a good cause, or if you want a week in a caravan in Porthcawl, make sure you buy plenty of raffle tickets. CAR HORN BEEPS Mr Sharpe? I'd rather you didn't park... Don't fuss, Mrs Evans. It's fine where it is. If you could just move it round to the side. Marvellous job you've done organising this. You're becoming rather a a dab hand at organising. I gather you were behind that bolshie little protest the other day. Marching all the miners up to have their x-rays done? - Very clever. - I'm glad you think so. It won't make any difference though, unless you can prove that someone is responsible. Can you do that? Because if you can't, you might as well not bother. Once the results of the x-rays have come back and they're sent on to the Coal Board, then we'll... What? What do you think the Coal Board are going to do? Breathing difficulties are an occupational hazard for coal miners. I'll be sure to tell that to my dead husband. Are you sure this is going to work? - No. But it's worth a try. - What time are you meeting him? - I said I'd be at the fete at 12.30. - Are you sure he'll be there? I don't know. I hope so. You're not coming? Yes, but I'll see you there. I've been asked to remind you that the refreshment tent won't be open for the sale of alcoholic beverages until later this afternoon. We don't want a repeat of last year's fiasco. - Why not? - Best fun I had all year. Not everyone shares your enthusiasm for a punch-up, Bryn. I do! As I expect some of you will know by now, Dr Sharma and his lovely wife have decided to return home to their native land. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say what a real pleasure it's been to entertain our foreign guests. They've brought us a delightful splash of colour from their exotic country and we hope that we, in turn, have given them an instructive glimpse of the British way of life. But the good doctor isn't the only one who will be leaving the village in the next few days. My good lady wife and I are also off to pastures new. It's been my great honour to serve Trefelin over the past five years and I trust that I have left the mine, and the village, in a strong and healthy state. The mine may be healthy, but the miners aren't. And perhaps today is the perfect time for us all to come together as a community and bury the hatchet. I know where I'd like to bury it. Dr Sharma? Dafyd Lewis, Pontypridd Observer. - We spoke on the phone. - Oh, yes. - Thank you for coming. - How can I help? there's something you should read. Come with me, please. ..the Trefelin annual summer fete, open. Where did you learn to cook this? I just picked it up. It's not that hard, really. Basically, it's just a cawl. You can get everything you need for this in my shop. Apart from one or two swanky spices. But you don't really need them. It's much the same with or without. Pop in to the shop sometime and I'll give you the recipe. Megan's doing a fabulous job of organising the fete. Shame she can't organise that useless stepson of hers. Tom? He's all right. I heard he's going to sing for us later. About the only thing he's good for. Nan? Can you take over for a minute? I don't feel well. You should have thought of that before, shouldn't you? It's no good crying to me now. You can have another helping, if you like. On the house. Where did you get this? The previous doctor hid it in the surgery before he died. These are his notes? No, a friend translated them for me. This is damning stuff. If even half of it is true, Mr Sharpe has a lot of explaining to do. Then you have to publish it. Whoa. It's not that simple. I need more than just this. - On it's own, it's worthless. - Worthless? Yes. Unless there are men willing to come forward and confirm what it says in here, then this is just hearsay. If it's even true at all. But... why would these men lie? People lie for all kinds of reasons, Mrs Sharma. That's the first thing you learn in my business. Most of the time they don't even know they're doing it. - But you could find them and interview them? - I could try. But there's no guarantee that they would speak to me. It might not be worth the time and effort. You can't let Sharpe get away with this. You overestimate me, Dr Sharma. The Observer's just a small paper. It may not be just Sharpe. And if it isn't just him... Look, these are powerful men with friends in high places. You're frightened. Yes, I am. And you should be too. They could make life very unpleasant for you, unless you can prove what's in this diary. What if... I brought you a witness? Griffiths. What do you want? I need more time. You haven't got more time. Either I get that diary today or I let everyone know you're a thief. Don't do this to me. Stop snivelling, Griffiths, and get on with it. This is your doing. - Where's Gladys? - Never mind Gladys. Where's Dilys!? Well, this is one thing our colonial cousins certainly know how to do. Really good. In fact, I'd venture to say that it's the best thing they've ever done for us. Not like that awful muck you served up when the Sharmas came to dinner. Thank you, Dickie. So nice to know that you appreciate me. What did I say? Thank you for helping today, Nan. I didn't do it for you. I did it for the shop. When do you want me to move out? What? You said you wanted me to move out. You don't half talk rubbish, Gina. What do you mean? You think you're going to be able to find a place of your own? Who's going to pay for it while you're looking after that? - I don't know. - Then stop talking nonsense. You're not going to kick me out? I made that mistake once. I'm not make it again. But if you think I'm going to wash out nappies, get up in the middle of the night and run around buying endless presents, you've got another thing coming. I had enough of that nonsense with you and your mother. You won't have to, Nan, honestly. I'll do everything. Yes, well, you say that now. Get off. I still think you're a stupid little girl who should have known better. Is this on? Hello, sorry. You'd better tell him. I can't. I don't know what to say. Well, think of something. He needs to know. Even if he is useless. I've tried. Just talk to him, Gina. Try not to make all the mistakes your mother made. Mr Griffiths, it's important you understand. Some of the things it says in this diary are shocking. It's amazing that Sharpe was allowed to get away with this, that no-one's come forward... I know what it says in the diary. - I've seen it. - You have? - Yes. Do you know any of the men who talked to the old doctor? Would they speak to me? I don't know. What about you? Did you know all this was going on? Could you give me details? - Back it up? - I'm not sure. Would you put your name to it? Mr Lewis, can you give us a minute, alone? Sure. Even if we weren't leaving, you couldn't stay here forever, Dan. - I could come with you. - No. - Why not? Because Dr Sharma and I aren't your parents. You have to go back to your dad. I don't want you to go. I know. I'll never forget you, you know. Me neither. I got you a little something. Come on. Let's go and find your dad. If I do what he asks, Sharpe will ruin me. He's already ruining you. Look at yourself. You don't know what it's like here. You don't know what will happen to me. Can it be any worse than what's already happening to you now? You made a mistake. Admit it. Pay the money back. Accept the consequences. Miners are my friends, the only friends I've got. If they find out I stole from them... At least be a friend to them. Come clean. You are a miner, a shop steward, a socialist. If you can't make the right decisions, then we're all lost. You can't ask me to do this, doctor. You know a lot more about Gandhi than I ever did, Owen Griffiths. But I do remember one thing he said. Fear has its uses, but cowardice has none. Just listen to what Mr Lewis has to say. I'll leave you two alone to speak. Megan. Prem. Can we talk? Yes. - I'm sorry about this morning... - No, I'm the one who should be sorry. For letting you down. - I was an idiot for losing that diary. - It doesn't matter. Please let me have my say. I've always been the outsider in the village. You're the first person who's been there for me. You've helped me without judging. You've made me feel good about myself. - Megan, I... - No, please. I know you have your reasons for going, and that's none of my business. But I can't let you go without letting you know how much you've meant to me. Oh, Megan. I wouldn't have lasted five minutes here if it wasn't for you. Really? You've given me a purpose. Reminded me of what it felt like to be alive. You'll miss us, you know. I'll miss you, you know. Please don't go. Megan! Megan. Oh, hello, doctor. Sorry, Megan. Everyone's looking for you. It's Emlyn Dawkins and Ceri Joseph. The sheep contest. The sheep contest. This is your doing, Ceri Joseph. - No it isn't. - Every year... - No, it's not, it's you! Come on, boys behave! There you are, Megan. Tell him he's not getting away with it this year! What do you mean do you mean not getting away with it? All over a couple of sheep. Sylvia? What are you doing in here? Sylvia? You're drunk. I haven't even started yet. What do you think you're doing? There are people out there. "Ooh, there are people out there." What's the matter, Dickie? Are you worried they'll see your "good lady wife" isn't so perfect after all? Or maybe it's you who isn't perfect. - Give me that. - No. - You're going home. I'm not going anywhere with you. - Sylvia! - Leave me alone! Stop it! Don't make me slap you, Sylvia! 'Why would I want to go home with you? You're not even a real man. 'I could have had any man in this village.' They all wanted me. The rugby player? - Shut up, Sylvia! - The miners can't keep their eyes off me. 'The pop van boy? The one with the hair? 'I had to fight him off. 'Even the doctor fancies me. Every man in this village fancies me,' Except you! Fancy anyone calling you Dick. That's a joke. MUSIC: "Hit The Road Jack" by Ray Charles You need a hand, Mrs Sharpe? It's not a hand she needs. Come on now, Mr Sharpe. No hard feelings. Steady on, Bryn. That's a bit stiff! Mr Sharpe. What would you say to the accusation that you've been risking men's lives to make your mine more profitable? And for years have been lying to your workforce and ignoring their safety? You aren't seriously going to listen to anything he says? And I should remind you, Dr Sharma, to be more careful with accusations in a country in which you are a guest. I'm not making any accusations whatsoever, Mr Sharpe. I'm merely relaying the words of my predecessor. Dr Elwyn Thomas. Elwyn was an obsessive, senile old man who had no idea what was going on in my mine. But there are men who do, Mr Sharpe. Men who have first hand experience of what goes on in your mine. Who? What men, Dr Sharma? You don't seem to have much support. Basically because you're not one of us. I'll support him. Every word in that diary is true. And there's a lot more that Elwyn didn't know. That man is a thief and a drunkard. If you want to know how much he can be trusted, ask him where the missing money from the miner's benevolent fund is. It's true. Do whatever you want with me later, but don't let this liar get away with it. I don't have to listen to you. Then perhaps you'd be prepared to answer to the press, Mr Sharpe. Dafydd Lewis, Pontypridd Observer. What do you say to the allegations... All this lung disease nonsense is nothing has got nothing to do with my mine! They just smoke too much. This is all a joke to you, isn't it? Well, it isn't to us. More men are going to die because of you. Sylvia! You don't deserve what I did for your mine. None of you! Dan! Where have you been? Sometimes when you've found someone you think you could really be happy with. Well, it's just not meant to be. But I love him. I know. And I think he loves you too. In his way. What happens if he goes away and I never see him again? I don't know. Someone once told me that if you want someone badly you have to go out and get it. Maybe they're right. Come with me. On stage? - No. To London. - I can't. Us two, together. Taking on the world! Why not? What's stopping us? I'm pregnant. Come on! ♫ Whenever I'm with you Something inside♫ ♫ Starts burning... ♫ Care to dance? ♫ Something's got a hold on me♫ ♫ Is this the way love's supposed to be♫ ♫ It's like a heatwave♫ ♫ Burning in my heart♫ ♫ Can't keep on crying♫ ♫ It's tearing me apart♫ ♫ Whenever you call my name... ♫ You'll miss him, won't you? - Yes. - I'll miss all of them.
