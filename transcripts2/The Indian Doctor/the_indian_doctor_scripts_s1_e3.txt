 The Indian Doctor (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 3 - Young Hearts - full transcript 
 Dan steals Sharpe's car in an effort to escape his drunken father Owen and track down his mother in Cardiff but meets Kamini who,when Sharpe tries to have the boy arrested and put in care,claims that she was the thief so that no action is taken. She brings Dan home, an action which brings her closer to her husband. Megan learns from the diary that Dr. Elwyn believed Sharpe's plans for the mine seriously jeopardised the colliers' health but Sharpe is reluctant to allow Prem to conduct chest X-rays. For Megan's husband it is too late as he passes away,with his son Tom in the room below losing his virginity with Gina. Tom,however,accuses Prem of spending too much time with his stepmother Megan and indirectly blames him for the death.

You stick them in a bin and it makes a bigger bang. You've done this? - I used to. - Mrs Evans, I'm shocked. Didn't you do that sort of thing when you were a kid? Oh, yes, but in India the fireworks were much, much bigger! This man is coming down from national headquarters, Sylvia.

 Your promotion? He did mention we might talk about the Nottingham job. You see. I told you it was only a matter of time. Ooh, Dickie! This is so exciting. Will it mean a lot more money? - What? - The new job. I haven't got it yet. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Does my big Area Manager deserve a little treat tonight? Don't tell anyone about it! - I wouldn't. - You would. You can't keep your mouth shut. - Dickie! - It may all go wrong. You worry too much.

 Nothing's going to go wrong. Do you like this? - It's fine. - You don't, do you? - What? - You don't like it. Sylvia, I don't care. Maybe I should buy something new... to celebrate. I need a whole new wardrobe. - What's wrong with all the dresses you've got? Don't they fit? - Yes. Then why buy a whole new cupboardful? Do you think I look fat in this? - I really don't care. - Do you? Sylvia, there are more important things going on right now. You do. You think I'm fat. All right, yes. I think you're fat. Happy? What was that noise? It was nothing. Just some kid letting off fireworks. It didn't sound like fireworks. - You should get out. Do something. - Like what? There's nothing to do. - Meet people. Make friends. - With who? - There's no-one worth talking to. - That's just not true. Apart from you. And you refuse to talk to me. You never talk about Rani. About her life or her death. There's nothing to say. She died, I wasn't there. I should have been. I could have saved her. It wasn't your fault, I was there, do you blame me? Do you? I have patients waiting for me. - Good morning, Doctor. - So, ladies, what can I do for you? It's about my husband. He's not her husband. He was. Until she set eyes on him. He wasn't. They never married. We would have. Erm... Why was it you wanted to see me? - He's anaemic. - Who? My husband. Both your husbands are anaemic? - We've only got the one. - It's the same man. And we're not really married. Either of us. I see. So, what makes you think your husb... He's anaemic? My sister was anaemic and Rhodri's got all the same symptoms. He's weak, tired. He says he's got fever, headaches, palpitations. - He's got no go at all. - He was fine until he met her. - Actually, as it happens, there was no problem until - she - found out about us. That's when it started. Well, anaemia is fairly easy to diagnose. The underlying cause may be harder to. But you can make him better, can't you? I can't say. But there's no sense in worrying ourselves until we've done some... I am worried, though. - I'm worried sick. - So am I. - He's been off work for three weeks. - He drives a lorry. The hours are very long and it takes him away from home, but he's always been fine with it. Until now. Well, the first thing is to get him in, take a blood sample and... Oh, no. He won't do that. He doesn't believe in doctors. That's why we thought we would come and see you. Together. I'm sorry, I still don't understand. We thought you could come and see him. If we both told him... If we agreed...without fighting. Gofala beth ti'n gweud nawr. Jest gweud i fi. Then we think he'll listen. He'll agree to let you see him. - Please, Doctor. I hate to see him like this. - He's very sick. I could come round this afternoon. Say about three? Thank you. Thank you very much. - Are you working at the club tonight? - Yes. - Will you be late? - It depends. If the men want a lock-in. Don't worry, I can look after Dad. You sure? It's Friday night, Tom. I'll stay in. You stay out as long as you like. Two ticks! - Mrs Sharp? Come in. - I hate wasting your valuable time, Dr Sharma. Can I call you Prem? I don't know why they don't just sell these over the counter. All my girlfriends use them. If you could just give me one of your prescription things, I'll be out of your hair in a jiffy. - Why do you want these? - They're diet pills. - Do you know what's in them? - No. They're basically amphetamines. Is that bad? Yes. There can be serious side effects. Don't be silly. The only side effect is that you don't get fat. And I want it to stay that way. That's why I need the pills. Why do you feel the need to lose weight? Because...I'm a woman. And a very fine-looking woman... ..who certainly doesn't need diet pills. That's very sweet of you, Prem. Unfortunately my husband doesn't agree with you. Bydde dim ots 'da fi dod gatre at hob bob nos. Bydde hi moyn ti dod gatre ati hi? Na'r peth. Would you talk to your sister like that? Falle bod hi'n lico bach o rough. 'Gina?' You used to do Dr Elwyn's signature, didn't you? Why? Mrs Roberts... This is so silly, honestly. I don't know what all the fuss is about. I need to get some of these. They're diet pills, that's all. But he won't let me have them. - Why not? - Because he's not a woman. You are. You know what it's like. You put on a couple of pounds and all of a sudden a man can't bear to look at you. Actually, you probably don't know. Your notes. What do you want me to do? I don't suppose you could be an angel and get one of your little prescription thingies, - and sign the doctor's name, could you? - No. They're just diet pills, Gina. I'd make it worth your while. No! - The women in the village. What do they do? - Work. - When they're not working. - Look after their men. When they're not doing that? Cook? What do they do for distraction? There's the mother's union, sewing classes. Where do they go to get their minds off things? Pontypridd. - Is that a...big place? - Oh, yes. So they've got theatres? Operas? - That sort of thing? - No. They've got bingo. - Go get it then! - All right. - Agh, you're hurting me. - I haven't even started. Where's your father? - I told you to get Elwyn's diary for me. - I couldn't find it. So you decided to tell the doctor's wife all about our little deal. - She made me. - Don't lie to me, boy. Morning. - I'm sick of your stupid, worthless son. - I'm not stupid! You are. You're a feckless thug. He's only 12. - I don't care how old he is. He's a liability. - He's just a kid! He's never in school. He's always in trouble. He's just the sort of thing that gives this village a bad name. He was playing with fireworks. That's just a part of growing up, that is. No. It's not. Throwing fireworks at your elders or betters is not just a part of growing up. All kids get up to some mischief. It's vandalism. I've a good mind to have him locked up. That boy should be in care. You can't do that. Who's going to stop me? You? No-one would listen to you, Griffiths. You're a pathetic drunk, you're up to your eyeballs in debt and you can't control your son. RADIO PLAYS: "Surfin' USA" by THE BEACH BOYS We'll have the house to ourselves all night. Megan won't be back till late. You sure? I told her to stay at the club as long as she likes. And she will. Turn it down a bit, Tom. Why? It's not loud. Dr Sharma might not like it. - You're on your dinner break, ain't you? - Still. - Why are you so nervy? - I don't know. - Because of tonight? - Maybe. Hello, Tom. - < Have you got the list of house calls? - Yes. You like this? Yeah, why? I'm a Beatles man myself. You mark my words, people will be listening to the Beatles in 50 years' time. Enjoy your picnic. I don't think the old doctor knew who the Beatles were. He's just showing off. Hey! You stupid man! You nearly killed me! I'm sorry, Mrs Sharma. I didn't mean it. The steering's terrible on this thing. If you left your keys in the car, anyone could have taken it. - Don't be stupid, Griffiths. - I'm just saying. We both know who took it. - Who stole it. - Dan wouldn't do that. I'm going to the police. I'll have to walk. Walk? Where? - Don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I was going to go to Cardiff. - Cardiff? Can't now. Where are you going? - I'm running away. - You can't run away. - Why not? - You're only 12. Wait! I can't walk as fast as you. Then don't follow me. - You have to show me the way back to the village. - Why are you up here, anyway? I went for a walk. I needed to get away. You running away as well? - No. - Yeah, you are! We could run away together. - We could go to India! - Don't be stupid. I'm not stupid. Dan. Please slow down! Breathing a little easier again? I'll look in on you in a couple of days, but everything appears to be fine. I'll just see the doctor out then I'll bring you up a cup of tea. He's as comfortable as he can be. He has good days and bad days, mostly bad, mind. I'm afraid it's going to be like that from here on in. A husband dying of emphysema and a surly stepson. Not exactly what I imagined married life would be like. I don't think I'd have signed up if I'd known. No. I don't suppose any of us would. Oh. I almost forgot. The diary I told you about. Oh, right. You sure you don't mind translating it? It could just be full of idle gossip. No, it's all right. Why don't you come up to the club after? I'll go through it with you. - Fine. - Play your cards right, you might even get a free drink. Where are we going? Pencwm. Are you taking me back? No. And apart from the tiredness, and not feeling yourself? Well, I get palpitations, like. Any history of arrhythmia? Have you had palpitations before? - Always been fit as a fiddle. - You have headaches, though? That's right. Headaches and fever and dizziness. And a craving for ice. Yes, that's right. Dry throat. - Terrible craving for ice. - It's all the same symptoms my sister had. And she's fine now. So it's nothing to fuss about. A few vitamins, take it easy for a couple of days and it'll go away on its own, right? - Sh, Rhodri! - Gwranda arno fe, nawr. - The first thing is to do a blood test. - Oh, no. There's no need for that. I'm fine, really. He was off work all last week. And most of the week before that. It's not a problem. I've got sick days due me. Am faint allwn ni neud heb arian? - Ac overtime! - Bydde dim rhaid fi neud overtime oni bai amdano ti. Wel, gollais i job. I tell you what, Doc, I think you're right. Maybe we should do that blood thing. Good, good. But not here. At your office. - But I've have everything I need. - No. - It won't take a minute. - No, I said. I'd feel more comfortable in case something goes wrong. - Got me? - Nothing's going to go wrong. - Please, Doc. I want to do it at your office. Fine. - Shall we come with you? - No! Can we go now? - What is this? - An old coal mine. Really? An old mine. It was. It's closed now. Dan! Wait, take my coat. What's all this? Did you steal this stuff? They're only little things. - Not like cars. - That's different. I needed that. To get to Cardiff? - Why Cardiff? - I was going to try and find my mam. But you said you don't know where she is. Why did she run away? Because of my dad. I don't blame her. He's horrible. He's not that bad. - He's not as nice as Dr Sharma. - What? And you're running away from him. I am not running away from Dr Sharma. You're impossible. And running away won't solve anything. I don't want to go to a care home. Why don't you stay with your father? He's useless and anyway Mr Sharpe won't let me. What's it got to do with Mr Sharpe? It's none of his business. Everything is Mr Sharpe's business. You're the first person I've ever let in here. I haven't got any of those things I told you. I just copied what Elaine's sister had. - Why? - Truth is, Doc, I'm just knackered, that's all. Six weeks ago, some nosey-parker told Branwen about Elaine. She came round and they had a right bust-up. - Then they started on me, both of them, telling me I had to choose. - Choose between them? Well, I can't, see. Since then, it's been like the Olympics in the bedroom. Both trying to prove they're better. - I should just say no. - Right. - I'm only human, see. The thing is, see, I love 'em both. It would break my heart to have to leave either of 'em. And that's why you've had time off work? Umm... No, not really. Then why? There's this girl at work. - Another one? - She's very nice. Thing is, she wants me to move in with her. And I would, too. But not now. Not with everything else that's going on. - Could be a bit tricky, you know, the arrangement? - Indeed. Do me a favour, Doc? If you see Branwen or Elaine, tell 'em I've had the blood thing everything was all right, will you? Well, I'll tell them that everything's in order. I'm really sorry about wasting your time. It isn't a waste of time. The more I get to know people in the village, the better I can do my job. You must think we're all mad. - Not at all. - I bet you don't get this sort of thing in India. You'd be surprised! Mrs Evans? Er...is this a good time? It's a perfect time. How far does that go? Miles. Just the thought of it scares me. - You can't be afraid of mines if you're Welsh. - Why? You wouldn't be able to work. Are you going to be a miner when you grow up? Probably. My dad says it's good work. And it'll always be there. What would you do if you weren't a miner? Don't know. I've never thought about it. Well, you should. - Dan, it's late. - I'm not going back! I'll get lost if I try to go back on my own. Is that what you want? - No, but I don't wanna go. - All you have to do is take me to the edge of the village, then you can come back and be a hermit, or whatever it is you want to be. Is that too much to ask? No. Good. I've just flicked through it and it's full of technical stuff. But, from what I've read, Elwyn seems obsessed with the idea that Sharpe's changes to the mine was putting the men's health at risk. How would Elwyn know about that? Things people told him. People he talked to. Who did he talk to? Engineers? Doctors? No. Just miners. That doesn't sound very reliable. But they'd know, wouldn't they, miners? I have no idea. I don't know anything about coal mining. You don't find too many coal mines in Delhi. Can I help you? Is that where you're from? - Mm. Delhi. - What's it like? Just like any other big city, I'm afraid. I bet it's wonderful. You must be mad to want to come here. It's not so bad here. Wait till winter! Why, does it get very cold? It did last year. Even the sheep had woolly jumpers! Why did you come here? Oh, er, lots of reasons. I'm sorry, I'm being nosey. No. I don't mind. Lots of reasons. Some professional, some personal... And sometimes, I can't even remember why we came here. Well, I'm glad you did. - A snooker table! - You play? There was a table at my father-in-law's club. - I wasted a lot of time in there. - Really? Kamini hated it. She said it was worse than if I'd had a mistress. She was jealous of a snooker table? - She just didn't want my career to suffer. - I take it she doesn't play. No. Do you? A little. If Sharpe is putting the men's lives at risk... You don't know that he is. Not for certain. No, I know... But if men are dying. Men like my Gareth... because of the coal dust... If there is a health problem at the mine, I'm sure the Coal Board is aware of it. I don't think they are. And if they aren't, we've got to tell them about Sharpe. You can't accuse people of things without hard evidence to back it up! That's slander. That could get you into trouble! Legal trouble. - But we have to do something. - Hold on. When did we become a "we"? When you asked me to translate this diary, Dr Sharma. I'm serious! Please. Call me Prem. I think this could be really serious! Well, before anything, we have to translate the whole diary. The last thing we'd want to do is jump to conclusions before we have all the facts. You're right. Do you want to break? Ladies first. We play one game... and if I win, we get to tell everyone that Sharpe's a heartless murderer with blood on his hands. Mrs Evans! - What if I win? - Don't worry, you won't. And you can call me Megan. You're pretty good at this. It's all I did when I was growing up. All my cousins are boys. I got better than them and they didn't want to play me any more. I'm not surprised. Men can't bear losing to a woman. Gareth couldn't stand it. I had to let him win. I see you don't feel the same way about me! No. You're different. - Am I? - I think so. I haven't actually lost yet. Patience, patience. I'm thinking of showing the diary to Sharpe. Why? Well, if anyone knows the truth about this, he will. I really don't think you should do that, Dr Sharma. It'll be fine. You did that deliberately... to mess up my shot. Mrs Evans! That would be cheating! The key to the whole thing was the mechanisation programme. We're all very impressed with how you've handled things here. Particularly the workforce. Very tricky. Once I convinced them increased productivity meant bigger bonuses, I could push the whole thing through double-quick. No bolshiness, no union nonsense. Excellent - perhaps it's time we put your talents to better use. Can I talk to you, Mr Sharpe? - Not now. - It's about my boy. Go home, Griffiths. It's too late now. Do you know Nottingham at all? I've never had the pleasure. Mr Sharpe? It's the police. They've found your car. Ooh, this day just keeps getting better and better. Tell them I'll be down to see them after I've seen Mr McGregor off. - Perhaps a quick drink before you leave? - Yes, if you've got time. Plenty of time. You could always stay at my house for the night. - I'm still running away. I haven't changed my mind. - No. Of course not. But if you do, perhaps I could help you with your reading. It might give me something to do. Oi! - I've been looking for you. - Excuse me... - I'm sorry, madam. I want a word with this boy. Good evening. - Is your husband in? - He's late. - Do you know when he'll be back? No idea. Come on in. Mrs Sharpe. Perhaps I should just come back later... Mrs... Mrs Sharpe? So if you could tell your husband that I called... and I'd quite like to see him? - Have a drink. - It's quite urgent. Please. Sit down. You sure your mam's not coming back? She's not my mam. I know. Sorry. She's at work. She won't be back until late. Cos it'd be awful if she came in... She's not going to walk in on us. We'll be all alone. All night. We can do whatever we want. It's just my dad. - Is he all right? - Probably. - I'd better go and check on him, though. - Yeah. Tom? I really like you. Right. Mr Sharpe is on his way. I'm not going to be able to ignore this one, Dan. - I'm afraid it could be very serious. - How serious? Well, if Mr Sharpe presses charges, it will have to go to juvenile court, and then... I don't want to go to a care home. You could end up in borstal, Dan. Now why don't you do yourself a favour and admit you stole Mr Sharpe's car? Come on, Dan, tell me why you did it. - He can't. - Why not? Because he didn't take Mr Sharpe's car. I did. How dare you laugh at me? I'm sorry, Mrs Sharma, I didn't mean to be rude, but... Well, I know you didn't take Mr Sharpe's car. - You don't - know - anything of the kind. - I found a photograph of Dan's mother on the front seat. - I put it there. Now Mrs Sharma, we both know you didn't do that. Are you accusing me of lying? No! Of course not, but... Why would you take Mr Sharpe's car? I wanted to learn how to drive. I'm really sorry I was so horrible to you this morning. You must think I'm awful. - People get emotional when they see the doctor. Health is - ... It's just really...hard, sometimes. Always wondering if you look good... if people appreciate you. Well, I can understand how that's important to you. Amphetamines aren't the answer. You said you found me attractive. Ah, actually what I... That meant so much to me. - Did it? - Just to feel desired. Right. I need to tell you something. Something personal. Something intimate. Oh... I want a baby. - I'm your doctor. - Exactly! Oh, I see! I thought you... Never mind. Sorry. For what? Promise you won't be mad? What? It's my first time. It's OK, it's my first time too. - Really? - Yeah. Dickie and I have been married for six years. Six years! Why can't I have a baby? It's all I've ever wanted. So you're having trouble conceiving? Conceiving? You actually have to have sex before you can conceive. Don't be ridiculous, Emlyn, she didn't steal my car. - That's what she's saying. - Well, she's obviously lying! Just to protect the boy! I know that, but as long as she's insisting that she took the car, my hands are tied. You can't let her pretend that she stole my car just to cover up for that little thug! I agree. It's not right. But you know, it might be for the best. What!? The boy's had a real fright this time. I don't think we'll be having any more trouble out of him. He knows I'll have my eye on him. I don't care. Well, in the end, it's up to you, Mr Sharpe. I'll have to caution Mrs Sharma whatever happens, and you'd be within your rights to press charges. Only, I have to warn you, it could get very messy... for everyone. Was it how you thought it would be? No. Mind you, I don't know what I expected. Me neither. It was different, though. From what everyone says. - You're not worried, are you? - No. Because it was fine. Really. - Was it? - Yeah. It was gorgeous. I'd better check on him. - Yeah. - Won't be a minute. I thought I was too fat, or too old, or that he had someone else. It never occurred to me that it might be him! Well, it's just one possibility. Until I see him, that's all I can say. Impotent? Impotent? If he is... How can I have a baby if he's impotent? There's no sense in worrying about this until I've seen your husband. If you can get him to come to the surgery, then we can start... Oh, no, I can't. He'd never do that. That's him. < Sylvia! Front door's wide open! You can't tell him I said anything about this. Anything at all. - What are you doing here? - Mr Sharpe, I need to speak to you. - It is important. - What about? - Can we talk in private? - It's a bit late for that, isn't it, Doctor? I'm sure Dickie's all tired out after his long day. - What he needs is a good meal and a nice drink. He doesn't want... - Sylvia, go to bed. But you must be starving, I've made your favourite. You're drunk. Go to bed. Good night, Doctor. Mrs Sharpe. Now, Doctor. What can I do for you? Would they really have put me in prison? It certainly sounded like it. And England is supposed to be a civilised country. - Wales. - Sorry? It's Wales, not England! Are you going to get into trouble because of me? Let's just get inside. Dr Elwyn never understood what was at stake here. Never mind the white heat of technology - when I took over, they were still winning coal by hand. I brought in up-to-date machinery, slicers, shearer loaders... I think Dr Elwyn was less concerned with the health of the mine, more the health of the miners. No-one is more concerned with the miners' health than I am. Industrial accidents have fallen every year since I've been here. Check the figures. What about lung disease? Oh, lung disease. Elwyn was obsessed with lung disease. As if nothing else matters. There's a simple way of finding out how big the problem is. Chest X-rays. Please. You don't know these miners like I do, Doctor. They are their own worst enemies when it comes to health. The only time you'll get them to see a doctor is when they've got blood gushing out of them. They won't go to a hospital just for an X-ray. Then I'll bring the X-ray machines to them. You might want to think about that. Why? They don't want to know. And I don't blame them. Mining is a dangerous job. The only way... to take all the danger out of mining is to stop men going underground. Then, there would be no pit. What do you think would happen to the men in this village if the mine shuts down? - They would just have to find other jobs. - There are no other jobs! Not here, not in a mining village. There would be nothing. And poverty does worse things to a community's health than the odd case of lung disease. HUBBUB Pint of bitter. Go home, Owen. You've been losing all evening, and you're drunk. Go home and look after Dan. I can't. He's gone. What do you mean, he's gone? It's too late, anyway. There's nothing I can do now. Oh, I almost forgot to say how sorry I am about all this business with your wife. What business? Of course. You haven't been home yet. I'm afraid she had a bit of a run in with the police. - The police? - Yes. My car was stolen this afternoon. Everybody knows it was that wretched Griffiths boy but for some reason, your wife is insisting that she took it. - Why would she say that? - I've no idea. Put me in rather an awkward position, though. The police wanted me to press charges, but of course, I said it was out of the question. Thank you. Wives, eh? She hasn't found it easy settling in. Of course. Best forgotten. A word to the wise. If you really feel you need to go ahead with the X-rays, then I will of course help you in any way I can. But I do think that you may end up doing more harm than good. I said he could sleep here. It's a long story. He was running away from home. In Mr Sharpe's car? You heard. Why did you say you took it? They were going to send the boy to prison, Prem. And so you told the police that you stole Mr Sharpe's car? It was the only thing I could think of. I was tired! You won't believe what I've been through today. You know that nobody believes you. You have no idea how ridiculous I felt. I can imagine. Do you remember that night on Dal lake, when the whole night sky was reflected in the water? Do you remember what you said? It was like we were floating at the centre of the universe. You said, "You're not alone. "It's you and me against the world." Do you remember? I remember. Is it still you and me against the world, Prem? Is it? - Tom? - My dad's dead. Oh, Tom, I'm so, so sorry. - Megan wants you to come. - Of course, I'll get my bag. - This is all your fault. - Tom... You could've saved my dad. If you weren't so interested in my stepmum. The first thing is to find out how many miners - have got lung disease, and how bad it is. - How? 'Chest X-rays.' I don't want anyone going near that van, understand? Not one miner gets his chest X-rayed. I am on your side! He's lying. His house is paid for by the Coal Board! Him and Sharpe are as thick as thieves!
