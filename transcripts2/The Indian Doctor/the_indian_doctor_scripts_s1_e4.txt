 The Indian Doctor (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 4 - The Van - full transcript 
 Megan tells Prem that the diary reveals how Sharpe has broken numerous safety regulations but,when Prem arranges for a Mobile X-Ray van to come to Trefelin, Sharpe blackmails Dan's father into getting the miners to refuse to have tests. They are, in any case, naturally resistant,wrongly believing that Prem is working with Sharpe to get the mine closed and Tom's hostility does not help as gossips are claiming that Megan and Prem are having an affair. Fortunately Megan gets the men to see that Sharpe has been misleading them and that Prem is on their side and leads them all down to the van. Gina believes she is pregnant by Tom.

 Synced & corrected by Rambo Media Ltd and then by moviesbyrizzo If there's a health problem at the mine, - I'm sure the Coal Board is aware. - I don't think they are. And if they aren't, we've got to tell them about Sharpe. Elwyn was obsessed with lung disease, as if nothing else matters! There's a simple way of finding out how big the problem is. Chest X-rays. - I told you to get Elwyn's diary for me. - I couldn't find it! I'm afraid it could be very serious. You could end up in borstal, Dan. This is all your fault. You could've saved my dad, if you weren't so interested in my stepmum. - Hello. - You're Rhys Stephens.

 - I know. - You're brilliant. - Am I? My dad says you might be as good as Cliff Morgan one day. Well, I hope your dad's right. What are you doing here? - That's my X-ray van. You don't know how to get to Trefelin, do you? - Yeah. Can you show me? Stick your bike in the back, and you can ride up front in the cab with me. What do you want? I came to see your mother. She's not my mum. How is she? My dad's dead. How do you think she is? May I see her? Why not? That's the only reason you ever came here.

 I'm sorry I haven't come round to see you since the funeral. I wasn't sure of the right moment, and I didn't want to intrude. No, no. I'm glad you came. It's nice to see a friendly face. Everyone else who's dropped round telling me they're sorry about Gareth, but really they're just watching me. Everything I say, and do. But that's Trefelin for you. Thank you. I've always wondered, Prem, why did you decide to come to Wales? Why not? Land of Dylan Thomas, Lawrence of Arabia, - Richard Burton. - Richard Burton? I love films. I never missed one with Cary Grant, or David Niven, or Dirk Bogarde. A Matter of Life And Death? David Niven, I love that film. He plays a fighter pilot who falls in love with a radio operator. Even though they've only spoken for a few seconds before he's killed. No-one can understand how they've fallen in love so quickly. And her love brings him back to life. That film makes me cry every time. I'm the same with Dumbo. Don't laugh! It's really, really sad in the middle. Get your head in now. I can't believe he took the law into his own hands. Why does it matter what the Indian doctor does? - You're the boss, Dickie. - It matters a great deal. Well, as soon as your promotion comes through we'll never have to think about these stupid little people - and their stupid little problems ever again. - That's the point, Sylvia. I might not get the promotion. Of course you will. Why wouldn't you? Let's just say there are some things the Coal Board doesn't need to know. What's that got to do with the X-rays? I'm sure Sharma doesn't even know what he's doing. Do they even have X-rays in India? I don't know why I bother sometimes. I've got something for you. I've done some more work on Elwyn's diary. - You didn't need to. - No, it was good, took my mind off things. - I was right about Sharpe. - What do you mean? According to Elwyn, Sharpe's been breaking every safety regulation, and has been for years. The coal dust in the mine is worse than anyone ever remembers. Someone's got to stop him. And you still think it should be me. You're a doctor, Prem. People will listen to you. I'm not sure about that. Anyway, we need proof. That's just hearsay. - So what, we just give up? - No. If there is a health problem in the village, it's my responsibility. First we have to find out exactly how many miners have got lung disease, and how bad it is. How? Simple. Chest X-rays. We get every miner X-rayed. You know what these men are like about their health. We'll never get them to a hospital. We don't need to. I've got to stop him. I've worked too hard and too long for this promotion. And you deserve it, Dickie. I do. Everything's going to be so much better when we move. You just need to relax and stop worrying all the time. - That's probably all it is. - What? - You know, why you can't... - Stop it. It's irritating. When we get to Nottingham, will you please see a doctor? What for? I want a baby, Dickie. I'm not getting any younger. Oh, for Pete's sake, will you stop going on about babies?! I've got more important things on my mind. Dr Sharma, it's here. - That's Rhys Stephens! - Who? Rhys Stephens. Fly half for Cardiff and Wales. - Rugby! He's famous! - Oh, right. - Dr Sharma? - Hello. - Rhys Stephens. Is the van all right? I'm Gina. Pleased to meet you. Rhys Stephens. I know. I saw you play in Cardiff against England. You were amazing. Not that amazing. We lost. I know. That was awful. I still can't believe it. What are you doing in Trefelin? - Well, I'm with the X-ray van. - Oh, of course, the X-ray... We were just talking about that, actually. I'm Dr Sharma's receptionist. Assistant, really. He never told me it would be you. Well, it is. I know. Well, anyway. Mr Sharpe, the colliery manager, has given us permission to set up outside the mine. The easier we make it for the miners, the more X-rays we'll get. - Right. Well, give me directions, I'll get cracking. - I could show him the way. You sure you don't mind? Is that all right? It's fine! Come on, then. - You OK to get in? - Yep. Cheers, Dan. - The X-ray van's arrived. - Where have you been? I had to check in on Mrs Evans. You seem to be spending a lot of time with her. Because of the diary. If we want to get to the bottom of the miners' health problems, we have to translate it. I can't do that without her. You know the other night, why did her son say you were too interested in his stepmother to care about his father? Kamini, his father had just died, he was upset. Besides, he's a teenager, he doesn't know what he's saying half the time. And that's all it is? I'm needed at the X-ray van. I'll see you later. - Thank you. - No, no. I thank you. I'd never have found this place on my own. You sure you'll be all right getting back? - I don't have to get back. Not straight away. - Really? I could help you set up if you want. There's not much to it, but, yeah, why not? You're the first famous person I've ever met. - I'm not really famous. - You are. All right, maybe a little bit. Are you hungry? They've got a canteen inside. - No, I'm OK, ta. - Not even a cup of tea and a custard cream? - I'm not hungry, thanks. - Just a cup of tea, then. All right, a cup of tea. - But only if you have one with me. - OK. I don't want anyone going near that van, understand? Not one miner gets his chest X-rayed. What am I supposed to tell them? - Say it was my idea. - Then they'll be against it. Exactly. And tell them it makes the difference between the mine staying open and shutting. There's 100 years of coal left in this pit! It's not how much coal there is, it's how much it costs to get it out, Griffiths! If those X-rays turn out badly, it's the perfect excuse to shut it down. They'll probably buy your Indian doctor friend a champagne dinner. - They wouldn't shut the pit because of that. - Do you want to take a chance on it? - We're talking about men's lives! - No! We're talking about their livelihoods. You don't care about this pit, or the men who work in it. All you want to do is get out of here. I AM getting out of here. - What? - I'm being promoted, Griffiths. You make sure none of your men so much as sets foot in that X-ray van, and I'll be out of your hair forever. I can't ask them to do that. I rather think you can. Or perhaps I'll tell them about the money you stole. All right. But this will be the last thing I ever do for you. Not quite. I also want Dr Elwyn's diary. - Good afternoon, doctor. - Mr Sharpe. - I see your X-ray van has arrived. - Yes. I still think you're going to regret it, but I suppose you have to do what you think is best. - Indeed. - I hope you can get my men to cooperate. They're a tricky bunch. Well, I'll do my best. I've been meaning to ask you about the diary you mentioned. Would you mind if I had a look? I'm afraid I don't have it. Well, I'm sure if you ask your lady friend nicely, she'll give it back to you. - I beg your pardon? - Oh, come on, doctor, we're both men of the world. - I don't know what you mean. - This is a village. People talk. Cheerio! What's inside there is no different from what was in them Cuban missiles. It's all radiation, one way or another. Shouldn't be allowed. You mark my words, if that thing goes up, there won't be much left of the village. Gina! Get in the picture. Everyone bunch up! Tom? Sorry... Well, you've attracted quite a crowd. It happens sometimes. Lots of pretty girls. Radiographers aren't usually as popular as this in India. Oh, it's not cos of that... I'm just teasing. You play rugby. I know, Gina told me. So, had many takers for your X-rays? None. None at all? - Probably all down the pub. - Right. Well, maybe I'll drop in there. See if I can't drum up some business. Rhys! Right! I was so sorry to hear about your trouble. Thank you. Such a lovely, gentle man, Gareth. Yes. Always helping other people. Yes. And so unlucky, poor man, with his wife dying, Tom being left without a mother, and now this. Hmm. It's always the good ones that suffer. Still. At least he had you. That's something, I suppose. Yes. - Mr Stephens? - Yes. Richard Sharpe. Mine manager. This is my car park you're clogging up with your van. I'm sorry. I thought it had all been arranged. Only teasing. We're delighted to have you here. Absolutely thrilled. This is my wife, Sylvia. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice frock. Thank you. It's new. The Coal Board are very keen on this sort of thing. And so of course, am I. Have you had many takers yet? - No. None, actually. - Really? Well, I expect things will liven up when the men come off shift. So, this is what all the fuss is about. My husband says you play rugby. - Yeah. - And you're famous. Well, I wouldn't say that. Amazing! You can fit a whole X-ray unit into one of these! - Would you like to have a look? - Would you mind? Incredible! Technology nowadays... Thank you. Have you heard about the X-ray van? - Yes. The doctor told me. - Dr Sharma? - Yes. - You went to see the doctor? No. He came here. Really? You're not ill, are you? No. - He was paying his respects. - Oh. I wouldn't have thought he'd been in the village long enough to know anyone that well. Mind you, I suppose, with your Gareth being ill, you've spent a lot of time with our Indian doctor. Such a lovely man. Shame about him and his wife. Some people are saying he's found himself a fancy woman. That's ridiculous. That's what I keep saying. But you know what people are like. Still, lucky girl, whoever she is. - HE kissed ME, Tom! - I know. I saw. He was just fooling around for the photograph. It didn't mean anything! - That's not what it looked like. - I was just excited, that's all. He's famous! Maybe I should go away and come back when I'm famous. No! I don't want you to go away! I don't even care if you're famous. You don't care if I'm famous? No! Yeah... You're twisting everything, Tom! You're the one who's twisting things. If I made you jealous, I'm sorry. - You didn't make me jealous. - I don't... We're not married, Gina. If you want to go off with someone else, then you can. But I love you, Tom! People say that all the time. It doesn't mean anything. I heard they were having some problems with the film. Have they ironed all that out? A lot depends on the skill of the technician. Some are better than others. Well, I'm sure we're all in good hands with you, no matter how long you've been doing this. Where are you staying? - I normally sleep in the van. It saves money. - Oh, you poor thing. What do you do for dinner? I've got a camping stove in the back. Oh, how awful. At least let us make you dinner. Dickie? Absolutely. Our pleasure! Well, I wouldn't say no to a home-cooked meal. - What would you like? - Anything. Surprise me. All right, I will. Come on, lads, let him speak! - He doesn't understand. - Give him a chance to explain. We owe him that. Look, doc. A friend of mine got an X-ray once. First they told him he had a bit of dust. A year later he went back and they said he had none. That's not possible with this kind of lung disease. Once you've got it, you can never get rid of it. So maybe he didn't have it in the first place. - Well, it's possible there was a problem with the X-ray film or the technician... - You see? You can't trust these X-rays. If they get it wrong, then I'll be moved to surface work, and I lose half my pay. My wife's expecting a baby. What happens to your wife and baby if you get sick? Once it gets into your lungs, unless you stop breathing dust, it'll get worse. There's a lot that can kill you down the pit. The dust is bad, but there's much worse. Best just to get on with it. I understand, really... Have you ever been down a mine? No offence, doc, but you have no idea what we're talking about. The most important thing is that the pit stays open. More important than your lives? You're not from round here, doctor. You don't know what happens to a village when a pit shuts down. We need these jobs, doctor. All I'm trying to say is if... I wish I'd never posed for that stupid picture. And that's all it was? That's the reason he got so angry? - He kissed me. - Who? The rugby player? It didn't mean anything. Did you tell Tom it didn't mean anything? I can't. He won't listen. And, to top everything off, I think he broke up with me. Give it a few days and he probably won't even remember. Do you really think so? Men are always saying things they don't mean when they're angry. They can't help it. Oh, I hope I get over this bug before the fete. I'm going to be no good running a food stall throwing up all the time. - How long has this been going on? - Days. Every morning, just as I get up. It's awful. You're not late, are you? No. It's only just gone three. - No. Late this month? - No. I'm never late. I'm always in at 8.45am, every morning. No, Gina. Not late for work. Late for... You know... We all know the Coal Board is looking for an excuse to shut down the pit. - What I want to know is what does HE get out of it? - I don't get anything. If we don't let him take any of his X-rays in the first place, then he can't fix the results. I won't fix the results! They'll be... We should boycott the X-rays! Tell Sharpe to stuff it. This is nothing to do with Sharpe. Or the Coal Board! Then why is the X-ray van parked up right outside the pit? - And why is Sharpe telling us all to get X-rayed? - I don't know. - Maybe you do and you're just not saying. - No! - What ARE you getting out of this? - Nothing! - He's lying! - Whose side are you on, doc? - BANG Ask him why my dad died. Go on. Ask him. Why did my dad die after the hospital told him he had a year to live? Tom, he had a heart attack. It could have happened at any time. It didn't, though, did it? It happened when you were looking after him. Tom, I did everything I could for your father. But I couldn't cure him. No. You couldn't. You want to trust him? I wish he'd never touched my dad. I am on your side! - He's lying. His house is paid for by the Coal Board! - Him and Sharpe are thick as thieves. - No. - I saw him coming out of Sharpe's house the other night. No! Yes... I went to speak to him about.... The boy's right! Can't trust a word he says. - They're all the same. - You've got this all wrong! Stop, doctor. Don't. There's no point. When you first came here, I was all for you. We all were. But we need someone to look out for us. Miners. The last thing we want around here is a company doctor. So you didn't have anyone volunteer for an X-ray? - No. - No-one at all? No-one. Well, I'm sorry you've had a wasted day. I'll have to have a word with my men tomorrow. See if we can't rustle you up a few bodies. No. Thank you. I've had enough. I've got to be up early. Oh. Don't be silly. Big lad like you? I bet you can drink all night and still get up in the morning. You'd be surprised. And with my luck, everyone will turn up first thing all at once in the morning. I wouldn't count on it. I've been here five years and, believe me, it's been an uphill struggle to drag these people into the 20th Century. They can be very awkward. Excuse me. He can be such a bore when he starts going on about the mine. They're all like that. All the managers. - Really? - They drive me mad. - No. Thank you. - No? Oh, all right, go on. As long as I can have some more of your pudding. Did you like it? Like it? I loved it! You're a cracking cook, Mrs Sharpe. Call me Sylvia. I knew it wouldn't be easy to convince them, but I didn't expect them to turn on me like that. You're not one of them, Prem. Most of my patients are miners. Or their families. Without patients, I don't have a practice. Why did they call you a company doctor? - They think I'm working for Sharpe or the Coal Board. - That's ridiculous. Did Sharpe tell them that? I don't know. He's been lying to everyone for years. At least that's what it says in Elwyn's diary. I just can't get anyone to listen to me! What do you expect? We don't fit in here, we never will. - Morning, Rhys! - Rough night, was it? Get your end away, did you? Come on. Strapping young lad like you? I bet you're fighting the girls off. I was last night. Hey, you haven't got her inside, have you? No. I wasn't really expecting anyone this early but if you give me a couple of minutes to set up, I'll be ready for... What? - What's wrong? - You tell him. - I can't. You. - What? I don't know how to say this, Rhys, but you see... We think what you're doing for the miners is brilliant. For a great man like you to come all the way up here... That means a lot. It's just... You're not worried about the x-rays, are you? It's nothing, really. - All you have to do is... - No, no. It's nothing like that. The thing is, we're not here for x-rays. - No. - We can't have them. - It's nothing against you, mind. - Nothing personal. - Absolutely not. We think you're amazing. I saw you play against Llanelli. Best game I ever saw. - That penalty in the last minute? - Bloody brilliant. So, if you aren't here for x-rays, why are you here? We're, um... a sort of a... - picket. - We didn't want to be. - Absolutely not. - But we drew straws and... - A picket? - To enforce the boycott. - Boycott? - Of your x-ray van. - No offence, Rhys, really. But it's our livelihoods at stake. Right. We've got tea, mind. Fancy a cuppa? Oh, yes, please. - I've got some chairs inside. - No. Can't do that. Never crossed a picket line in my life. You could bring them out, mind. Sharma's only doing this whole x-ray thing because Sharpe told him to. And he calls himself a doctor. He's a disgrace. He's Indian, what do you expect? I expect him to do his job properly. He can't. He's too busy smarming up to Sharpe. You can't trust those people. They don't care who they step on. We need a proper doctor. My husband is a proper doctor. He's a better doctor than you or anyone else in this village has ever seen. He could have been a surgeon. Well, maybe he should have been. Because he's not much of a doctor. You have no idea how lucky you are that he's here at all. But then you wouldn't because you're all too ignorant to see what a remarkable, honest, decent man he is. Oh, well, pardon us. Who do you think you are? Coming here was the worst mistake we ever made. Well, why don't you go back where you came from, then? You won't be missed. I'll have the results for you in 24 hours. The test might come back negative. It won't. I'm pregnant. I know I am. Even if you are pregnant, it's not the end of the world. It is. Gina, You're a very capable young lady. Not many people could manage this surgery the way you do. And if you can cope with that, you can cope with anything. My nan will kill me. I'm sure she'll be fine. No. You don't understand. That's why she kicked my mum out of the house, because she got pregnant with me. Oh. - Is there anyone else you can go to? - No. What about the father? I think we split up yesterday. Have you told him? No. He's so hard to talk to. About anything. You should talk to someone. Don't keep it to yourself. Who? Well, I'm always here. If you're worried about anything you can always come to me. If I am pregnant, is there something you could do? You know, make it go away? Gina, no. I'm sorry. It's against the law. Gina? Promise me you won't do anything rash. Rhys! - Mrs Sharpe. - What a lovely surprise. - You ran off so quickly last night I didn't get a chance to say goodbye properly. - Sorry. That's all right. I knew you would. As soon as Dickie started going on about his stupid machines. - It wasn't that. - If he tells me about the white heat of techno what's-it one more time, I'll scream. I just felt nervous about leaving the van. I had a great time. Honestly. - Did you really? - Yes. It was fun. And you're a great cook, Mrs Sharpe. Sylvia. I was just on my way to the shops. If you tell me what you like, I can do you something really special tonight. Ah. I won't be here tonight. I'm booked over in Aberbargoed. I've got to push off as soon as I'm done. You have to go? I wish I didn't have to. Can't you stay the night and go to Aberbargoed in the morning? No. They want me there tonight. Nothing I can do. You could come over now. I could make you lunch. - It's only eleven. - It's just a short walk. I really have to get back to the van. I could come to you, then. What would you like? - Anything's fine. - See you later, then. The miners are boycotting the screening program! How can they possibly think that Dr Sharma would do something just because Sharpe told him to? I can see why the men are worried. If the pit shuts down there'll be no work. Why would the pit shut down? It's too small, Megan. It's the same all over the valleys. All the small pits are losing money. - Who says? - The future's in the new super-pits. Did Sharpe tell you this? It's no secret. Everyone knows. Gareth thought the world of you. I know. He told me once that you were the only person he could trust. But he never understood why you wouldn't stand up to Sharpe. It's complicated. Tell me. It doesn't matter. He'll be gone soon. - What? - The Coal Board are moving him on. - Why? - What difference does it make? Let's just let him go and then we can get on with our lives. No, Owen. I'm sorry. - I can't do that. - Why not? Because, if what Dr Elwyn wrote in this diary is right, more men are going to die because of Sharpe. Men like my Gareth. Where did you get this? It doesn't matter. And you can't tell anyone. DOORBELL RINGS But you should read it. And then try to tell me Sharpe isn't so bad. Dickie and I were so sorry to hear about your loss. Thank you. We'll be leaving the village soon. - Dickie's going to be promoted to an area manager, in Nottingham. - Really? Yes. It's a big step up for him. But if there's anything we can do for you before we go, just let us know. You've done quite enough already, thank you. I know we haven't always been best of friends, Megan, but Dickie really does want to put the past behind us and move on. I'm sure he does. We've always appreciated the little things you've done for us, so if you're short of money or anything, I could always find you some cleaning work to tide you over. Who do you think you are, Sylvia? There's no need to be rude. I have to go. I have someone inside. The doctor? - No. - Only I heard you were seeing each other. What do you mean, seeing each other? I don't really think that sort of thing is right, especially between the races. But I do admire your courage. And I know how lonely it can get. Owen? Owen? Right, that's it. - Where's Owen Griffiths? - He was here. Is he up the mine? - Is all this nonsense his idea? - Don't interfere, Mrs Evans. - This is no place for a woman. Don't you dare try that on with me, Alun Jones. I work here! And I want to know what it is you think you're doing. - They're trying to close the pit down. - Who is? - Sharpe. - The Coal Board. - The Indian doctor. - How do you know? Have you seen any reports? Anything official from the Coal Board? Everyone knows. Or is it just a rumour, a malicious rumour? Because there have been a lot of malicious rumours lately and some of them have been very personal. I would have thought most of you would have more sense than to believe them. But I'm obviously wrong. Because it seems you'll believe anything Sharpe tells you. He's got you all so terrified that the mine's about to shut, you'll even turn a blind eye to your own health. You think he cares if you boycott the doctor's x-rays? He needs those x-rays so he can shut down the mine. The mine is not going to shut down. - Sharpe is being promoted. - What?! Do you think the Coal Board rewards men for failure? And you know who's paying for that promotion? Men like my husband, and my uncle, and my father dying with their lungs clogged up with coal dust. And if you don't stand up to Sharpe then most of you will go the same way. And women like me are going to have to watch you die. There's only one reason Dr Sharma brought that x-ray van to our village. To help you, all of you. He's not a company doctor. He's standing up to Sharpe. Like we all should have done years ago. And if he can, so can we. OK, thank you for your... At this rate I'll have no patients left. - People have been ringing up and cancelling all afternoon. - I'm sure it will pass. You wouldn't believe the things people have been saying to me. I would. Some women were talking about you in Mrs Davies' shop. What did they say? It's just a few stupid people. Who happen to be my patients. I can't believe how quickly this has happened. I'm just trying to help these people. Maybe they don't want to be helped. Apparently not. But if I can't help them, what am we doing here? Maybe we would have been better off in London. - Well... - There must be something I can do. I can't think straight. Why don't you go for a walk? The fresh air might do you good. I couldn't take another patient telling me how evil I am. - I know, let's take the car. - Where? Anywhere. It doesn't matter. Just not here. Shall we? Griffiths! Griffiths! I told you to get Elwyn's diary. - And I'll get it. - When? I don't know. It's not that easy. Megan Evans has it. Just get it. Her husband was one of my best friends. Then that should make it easier. I can't break into her house. Why not? She's in mourning. Then she'll be distracted, won't she? You don't know what you're asking me to do. I'm not asking you to do anything, I'm telling you. If I give you that diary, I'll never be able to look anyone in the face again. If you don't get me that diary, then I'll make sure everyone knows all your grimy little secrets and the next time your boy so much as sneezes I guarantee he'll end up in borstal. Mrs Sharpe? I've brought you a little treat. I thought you deserved something special before you left. Which do you prefer? Beer or wine? I bet it's beer. I shouldn't really be drinking. Dickie likes wine. Real men always prefer beer. No, really, I'm fine. Oh, go on. No-one will know. I won't tell if you don't. - I just wanted to do my job. - You've done your best. My best wasn't good enough. It's... - Forget it. - What? It's not worth talking about. You always do this, Prem. And it drives me mad. Do what? Turn away and end a discussion. When I wanted us to go to London you wouldn't talk about it. When we decided to get married you didn't want to face my mother. Do you blame me? If I'd left it up to you she still wouldn't be speaking to us. Not such a bad thing! It's not funny, Prem. Whenever you can't cope with something you make a joke. Or worse. How many times have I tried to get you to talk about Rani? It's not easy, Kam. You think it's easy for me? Rani died because I wasn't there to save her. I was there. She died in my arms. You're not a doctor. I was her mother! I was dealing with meningitis cases every week. I would've recognised it if I'd been there, but I wasn't there. No, you weren't. Because you were hundreds of miles away dealing with the biggest outbreak of TB in years. You think our child died because you weren't with her? Hundreds of parents were to keep their children because... you were with them. Doesn't make it any easier. And that's why we came here. For a fresh start. To get away from it all. It hasn't really worked out that way, has it? We should go. Can't we stay here just a little longer? No. I mean leave. Leave the village? - And go to London? - No. Go home. To India? It's the only home we've ever known, isn't it? All those things you said about me. - I was just being nice. - And you are nice. - Very nice. - Mrs Sharpe. Sylvia. We can do anything you want. I don't want to do anything. Mrs Sharpe! - Getting up to mischief, Rhys? - She's old enough to be your mother! Those machines of yours still working, Rhys? - Yeah. - Then I've got a few men here who need to see you. MUSIC: "Stand By Me" by Ben E King Dad? If you mention this ever again, to anybody, you will be on the street so fast your feet won't touch the ground. You have Dr Elwyn's diary? Dr Sharma? David Lewis, Pontypridd Observer. - We spoke on the phone? - Oh, yes, thank you for coming. This is damning stuff. If even half of this is true, then Mr Sharpe has a lot of explaining to do. Please don't go. Synced & corrected by Rambo Media Ltd followed by moviesbyrizzo
