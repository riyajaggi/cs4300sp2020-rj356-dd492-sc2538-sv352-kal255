 Drake & Josh (2004â€“2007): Season 1, Episode 5 - First Crush - full transcript 
 Josh has a crush on fellow schoolmate Kathy, but feels awkward every time he goes near her, so Drake teaches him how to be himself when he talks to her. Josh lies and tells her he plays the guitar, so Kathy invites to play a song for her at her birthday party, something that puts Josh in a predicament. Elsewhere, Drake gets a gig at the Brew Note, a local coffee shop. But it's short-lived when Drake accidentally throws a live snake into the audience that Megan put in his backpack.

I'm in trouble. I told Katy that I play guitar. - Why lie to her? I do not know. I blurted it out like a kind of ugly pimple. Thanks for the dirty thoughts. Help me simply. - Okay. Be a calm. She does not know that you lied to her. She expects me to play a song for her on her birthday Saturday. No problem. - Well problem. Josh. Do not know how many songs are made up of three simple chords? I can learn three chords for Saturday. Can you? - Of course, I can even a monkey to learn to Saturday. Unbelievable. You broke every string! We better call a monkey. There are people with no arms who can play guitar. With their feet! This is my fault by lying. I'm just going to tell the truth and let her my whole life hating me. You can not tell her the truth. - I can not live with a lie. Look. You want honesty, if you want a girlfriend? - Girlfriend, please. Okay, I think I have a plan. Where is Katy's party? The Remarkable Brew. Right. This day gets better. The coast is clear.
