 Previously on Barkskins... The Iroquois always collect their dead. What will you do when they come back to make their own dead? It was a business dispute. I'm done with both you and that English bastard Cooke. Gus Lafarge is dead. I saw his end myself. The Company did not send you here. If they had, you would know that what happened... Cross's idea. Cross is married to my sister.

 ♪ Thus dies well. ♪ God is watching. He, uh, even watches us here in this speck of a town. Then he can see what you have done. What is it that I have done apart from putting food - on your family's table? - God knows. Just as you know what happened to my husband. God knows that Gus was a good and loyal man. Where is my son? He ran into the woods, from what I was told. No. He would have been home by now. I will find him. Now... we must see him into the earth so that he may pass over. How will you find Thom? Charles, my new man, will find him for you. I'm sorry for your loss. Did you know my husband? No, uh, but he was a good man, I'm told. A steadfast man. My husband left me with nothing. Murdered. And now my son is lost in the woods. I am widowed, and all of my days will now be doomed. I will see that you're taken care of. I will find your son. That is a promise. Now cover him so that he may pass into the kingdom of heaven and be forgiven in the eyes of our maker. Forgive me, Father. It calls to me, even in contemplation of Your words. The smell of Your crust. The way it sits in my belly. Look away. Please. Have mercy. To know the Creator, one must first know the whole of the world. And to know the whole of the world, one must first know the Law of Two, which governs everything. Nothing is single here, everything is double. Every element contains its opposite. Each sunrise starts at sunset the night before. Every man emerges from a woman. Wars are plotted at peace. Sides of the same coin. Good. Now... come and choose your sweets. Gather in the chapel, children. Quickly. What are you doing? I was illuminating them, Mother. Illuminating? I will have them double their prayers. Ah, yes. I'm sure they will find all the great answers to the world while on their knees, praying. It is your solution to everything. You would do well to take them out beyond the walls and show them the claws of beasts. State your business. I have come for my bride. Ah, you disagree with the union. Speak your mind. Let the poison out. You don't share a God, yet you hope to share a bed, and put children into the world. We share the same God, just different sides. But I think those differences will make the marriage bed more interesting, don't you think? You chose well, Delphine. Pierre is a fine trapper. You chose correctly as well, Isabelle. It all happened so fast. He was the first to look at me. That means he was drawn to you. But then he... he barely spoke to me. It will come, in time. Or it won't. There is no way to know for certain. The men put on a show, as did we. We all played our part. Some more than others. I am sure all of our men will be kind. I just pray that he is patient. Patient? No man is patient, Delphine. Not even the priests. The least he could do is provide you with a real ring. That is what a kind man would do. - He promised me a proper one. - Hold him to that. He must value you more than a strip of leather, or that is all you will ever be. Mes chéries, hasten. You have an hour before the signing. Use it to pray for guidance and protection. May you find utility and grace and... Happiness? Yes, of course. Happiness. Melissande. Come with me. Yes, Mother. I wish to talk to you about Monsieur Trepagny. Mm. He is not like the other men. Yes. He is rich and well-dressed. The other men smelled of dead animals and shit. Do not be taken in by his boasts. It is one thing to say that you have land as far as the eye can see. It is quite another thing to be able to hold on to it. I will see it for myself. I am sure he is the man for me. I have made my choice. I wish you luck. And our secret? A man of Monsieur Trepagny's standing must never know I am not as God made me. It is yours to tell, child. Do you have what I gave you? Father Gabriel often came here to contemplate after his chores. He didn't return for morning prayer. Perhaps he shucked his robes and ran off. No. He has been taken by Iroquois. And how is it you know this? The bodies are gone. Well, perhaps Father Gabriel ate them and then sank into the river. It was a sin to display the dead like that. And it is a sin to let these savages think they can move on us. The Iroquois will return. I have been among them. I know how their minds work. I'll post a lookout. And I'll need men to lead a search party for Father Gabriel. I have no spare men. Intendant De Fer is coming. Father. I like them in a pot with wine and herbs. Oh. You do, now? I come in a friendly and helpful manner. A man of many talents who could be of use to you in your current state. I know what you are after, Monsieur Gasquet. I could tell you the all of it if you invited me for a meal. You are welcome to pay for a meal like everybody else. As I am learning, my late husband extended credit to the entire town. I didn't mean that sort of meal. Go away. Perhaps tomorrow, then. You can come out now. Rabbits. Monsieur Gasquet brought them. Can you say "rabbit"? Hmm? He has designs on the inn and some other things as well. Monsieur Gasquet does not take no for an answer. The more I push him away, the more he sees the challenge. He has grabbed me more than a few times, and with Francis right there. Ah, but did Francis protect me? No. And when I demanded that he put Monsieur Gasquet out, what did he do? Hmm? He did nothing, Renardette. Nothing. He was as useless as a spring flower. And now I have found he has let half the town dine on credit, and it is up to me to collect the debt so that I may carry forth. But we will make do. Hmm? Us girls will make do, and then... we will prosper, Renardette. Oh, careful. You will hurt yourself. Go. Bonjour, Mathilde. Captain. I have said all I will say on my husband's death. Oh, no, I have not come about that. I was hoping to have a word with the Hudson Bay man, Mr. Goames. Departed this morning. Ah. Did he say where he was off to? There was some discussion of a trip to Quebec City. I believe they intend to return. They asked me to keep a room for them. Better they do not return. Oh, they will be back. I'm sure of it. They are keen on finding their missing man, Mr. Cross. That one is dead, more than likely. Is there something else? Mm. Um... Keep a sharp eye out and don't go beyond the walls. Especially after dark. The Iroquois paid a visit to the docks last night. The bodies are gone. A priest missing. Have you talked to Mr. Cooke about the troubles? What would Mr. Cooke know of the massacre? Scheming with Gus Lafarge about the land by the creek, they were. Henri Marth, too. - Marth? - Oh, yeah. I heard them discuss it more than a few times. Was this before or after you fell into dispute with Lafarge on the matter of tables? Eh? A fierce wobble? I believe he was too busy scheming with Mr. Cooke instead of building a proper table to sit without a wobble. Cooke and Lafarge are responsible for the creek massacre... is that what you are saying? I am saying I heard them discussing it, and then, not a week later, those poor settlers met their end. I suppose one could see it that way. Aye. All of my head spins with rumor. What I need are facts. Of course you do. I am just an innkeep. What do I know of facts? - You are more than that, Mathilde. - Mm. And you are the captain sent to watch over Wobik, not me. Yes. Yes, I am. And I will come up with a plan, rest assured. A wise man would run Mr. Cooke out of Wobik. Put things to order before it is hung on your head. Mm. Help... help me. Mercy. I'm burned. You must leave the water. Something for the pain, please. Wait for me. I will be back. _ Sit. Randall Cross. Yes? Who ordered this? There was no order. I took it upon myself. My sister Alice... I still don't understand the impetus to use company resources for a personal mission. A Mr. Elisha Cooke in Wobik says that he and Randall Cross had a plan to stir the Iroquois against some French settlers. Aye, that is correct. Along with the delivery we're supposed to make. Mr. Cooke is well acquainted with English interests in the region. Interests that include moving forward against Wobik. Were the settlers cleared? They were. Massacre. I want to know if that was Cross's orders. To work with Mr. Cooke. We find allies where needed. Trade. That is our business. - Or have you forgotten that? - I know Randall, and such an action... a massacre of innocent people... that is not his blood. I need to know if he was acting on orders. The orders were to make way inland, weaken the French hold. The particulars are not important. We have larger plans. That is no secret. I'll ask again. Have you made a report? Yes. I will see it, then. Furthermore, I'm granting you and Mr. Kirkpatrick the oversee of the Wobik post and all the land west of the creek. If Mr. Cross is to be found, the posting can be restored to him. And if he is lost? Then you will contact the Iroquois and let them know that should they choose to avail themselves of muskets to rise up against the French, that they will be supplied in abundance by their stalwart friends at the Hudson Bay Company. - And you expect us to work with this Mr. Cooke? - If possible. But Mr. Cooke is not our only asset in the region. Bill Selby is about. Now you have your assignment. Now be gone. Mademoiselle Isabelle Caron and Monsieur Vincent Belonger. Hand over the notarized property list. Félicitations. Mademoiselle Delphine Langois and Monsieur Pierre Gasquet. Your property list, Gasquet. Mademoiselle Melissande de Saint Rémy and Monsieur Claude Trepagny. Now I have the whole of the moon. Please accept my humble tithe, Mother. I wish you happiness and fortune. We are the mothers of New France. Will we see each other again? Of course. There will be market days. There will be time to visit. - Delphine! - Oh! Put me down! My apologies. Melissande? Step away from this noble voyageur before he carries you off into the woods. One pelt per man, Pierre. One pelt. Should move on. My bags. Oh, do not concern yourself. We will send for it later. My man, Rene Sel, will fetch it. Bonjour, Mathilde. Monsieur Trepagny. Are you coming to pay your bill? Your bill. Are you coming to settle your bill? I believe I am current. I have a balanced account in all things. Oh, no, no. I am going through my late husband's books, and it seems there are a few outstanding charges. It would be a shame if your new bride could not come to the inn should the need arise. The need may not arise. We are going to my Doma, and she is not yet my bride. In the eyes of the king, yes, but there are higher bindings yet to be done... a proper wedding. A celebration and one to which you will surely be invited. Now have we settled our debt? Madam. Good fortune to you. You will put a show of it on and tell Lafarge's widow her boy took a boat to Quebec City, distraught at his father's demise. Is it not better if she hears it from you? No, it is not better. You will find the truth in it, she will gladly accept it. That is your task. I understand, but when will I be paid? The job is not finished. Until it is, you should view me as a blunt blade that will smash you if you cross me. You asked I take care of Lafarge's boy. It was taken care of. That's worth something. It is. Well, this won't cover passage. A smart man forgoes small reward now for great reward later. Compounded with work, dedication and loyalty. Loyalty? I will teach you the barrel game. What do you think that is... the barrel game? You take timber, cut staves, make barrels, sell them. But you think too small, Charles. It is not the barrels themselves. It pays to have a hand in what goes in and out of them as well. Spice, cloth. That brick, there. I brought that across the Atlantic, bought the barrels back at a discount, and here are the barrels filled with salt fish. Up the river, I take a piece. Down the river, I take a piece. Everything for a price. Was that Gus's role in your company? Oh, Gus's role is no more. You see, it's not about the timber or the staves or the hewing or joining. It's not about the making. Look at these Frenchmen. Look at them slaving away. Making their tannin, their tar, their rope. While they are busy making, I am busy trading. With the English? It is unlawful to trade with the English. Few staves, some wax, it would be good as new. If it isn't the rat. Sir. I see you have found a proper Paraclete to serve your foul designs. I told your friend Sel the rat will find a hole. You may take him, if you like, though I do have use for him. He is yours. I forfeit my claim. Gladly and with all my heart, I release you. Good luck to you both. I am off with my new bride, full of bright thoughts. Step aside, Trepagny. I have matters to put right with Mr. Cooke. - What is this? - Tell me where Henri Marth is. - I do not know. - You are a liar. This is not a proper hearing. You have no right. Your rights in New France died with your wife. I hereby exercise the power of the crown, and I offer you a choice. I relieve you of your house, your cooperage, and cast you out of New France. Or you submit now to the fiddle. I will not be scapegoated. Then confess your hand in the murder of the innkeep. That was Gus's business, not mine. Then there is the business of the bloody massacre. I hear there were more than Iroquois at play. Eh? A fine and poisonous English mind, in fact. Where is your evidence, you drunk? Mr. Cooke, this will go better for you if you do not play me for a fool. The fiddle will help us find the truth. - Eh... - All right! All right! I submit. There is a lock of hair in my pocket. Take it out, give it to me. It belonged to my wife. Give it to me, Bouchard. Dirty English! You will stand bared before the people of Wobik for the murder of Francis Geffard! Let Mr. Cooke's punishment be an example to every man in Wobik! Throw away the key! You're Wyandot? Have you told anyone of me? No. Do I have your word that if you heal, you will leave this land and not come back? I c... Yeah. Good. Now sleep. I will return with food. If the pain is too much, take all of this in one swallow. Spotted hemlock. You will go to sleep and not wake up. My mother was a wit, and I-I know that I said my favorite of her sayings was the one about the bloated monk who feared his vow of silence covered farts, but I don't have her way with the phrase. I'm afraid I'll word it wrong. Tell it another time, chéri. The woods reward silence. It is in the silence we hear things not of this world. Come. I will show you. You must step very carefully. Here and here. Are you nervous of what you will find when you reach my Doma? Perhaps. Which means you know surprises loom. Ah. It's fine. They are everywhere on my Doma this time of year. And there are the mice, of course. And many hawks, which also eat the mice, but prefer to eat the snakes and sometimes get both. There is also another creature that menaces them all. The child of my housekeeper Mari. This is one of the surprises I will warn you of now. You have a housekeeper? I depend on her. She is a Wyandot woman. She may test you, she may throw curses at you. Then you must put her in her place. She has long since forgotten her place, I'm afraid. Come. I will tell you the story of the wasp that followed me for two days. Yes. I looked and saw... Come out of there. Stayed where I put you. Are you going to kill me? Not if you leave. Do you understand? Follow the river to Quebec. Please. I want to go home. And I should do as I was paid to do. Smash your brains out. Now go. I'm giving you a chance. - Tell my mother I love her. - I shall tell her you're dead. Now go. Do you like it here? It's perfect. We shall have more. More land. More family. Of course, a proper house. Come. Put it on. Please. Everything is good? Ah, come on. It's good? Perfect. Good, you liked it? Uh, bouger, bouger, bouger. Bouger, bouger. Okay, I'll be right back. What are you doing? I've been waiting for a meal, Mathilde. You have been in the drink. True. Monsieur Gasquet, if you will leave my kitchen at once, I shall prepare your food. And I shall be direct with you, Mathilde. I am not asking for that. I am asking you to let me get back to my work. I would partner with you. There is no more need for you to put up resistance. You will need a man. - Better you see that now. - No! No! Monsieur Gasquet, I am telling you I do not need a man. Now, if you will please leave my kitchen. At once. I am sorry, Mathilde. Shh. It's okay. Don't. Shh. I'm cold. Come over here. I will warm you up. Take off the dress. You are my wife now. Take it off. Come to me. Pierre, I'm sorry. It's been a tiring day. I'm going to sleep. You should do the same. Is something wrong? Is this it? It is veiled in the dark. The daylight will open your eyes to its beauty. I wish to see it all. You will see everything in the morning. That is my contemplation room. I will show it to you another time. I wish to see so that I might better know my new husband. One must have secrets. Don't you agree? For now, I will allow you just this one. Shall we go? Yes. The true binding of a man and woman must have a ceremony befitting the sanctity. A celebration. Exactement. A party to celebrate our union, so it may be bound in the vault of heaven. But tonight... we must bind and consummate as God intended all creatures. Even the snake. Good. I see now what kind of man you are. The lock of my wife's hair. Fetch it for me. Would you sit with me?
