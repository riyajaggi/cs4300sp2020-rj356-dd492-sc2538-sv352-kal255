 TREPAGNY: Previously on Barkskins... RENÉ: He will hunt you down if you leave. CHARLES: Then we shall make a game of it. MARI: He has more land than he can hold. It is for a fille du roi. He wants to fill the Doma with children. TREPAGNY: I am to have a wife! CHARLES: Whoa, whoa. Please, I mean no harm. CHARLES: No, no. Have-have mercy! MATHILDE: Thom! What are you after? [GRUNTING]

 HAMISH: It is Francis. He's dead. MATHILDE: Go. Get the girl. HAMISH: The priest? YVON: They came for him. I-I put him down. [GRUNTS] HAMISH: Where is he? Watch over the priest. I'll find Lafarge. Take this. I'll be quick without it. ♪♪ ♪♪ [GRUNTING] ♪♪ [ROOSTER CROWING] [INHALES SHARPLY] [BLOOD DRIPPING]

 - [DOOR OPENS] - [BELLS JINGLE] BOUCHARD: I came to hear your account of what happened. MATHILDE: It was Gus Lafarge and his boy. The whole town knows that. BOUCHARD: What were they after... the girl and the priest? MATHILDE: No. It was a business dispute. Gus had it out for Francis. - He came by threatening us both. - BOUCHARD: A business dispute? MATHILDE: That is my account, Captain. BOUCHARD: I'd like to hear details of this dispute. MATHILDE: A wobble. This is Lafarge's poor craftsmanship. BOUCHARD: This mayhem is on account of a wobble? MATHILDE: The wobble upset Francis. Gus refused to honor his work. BOUCHARD: And that is what happened last night? MATHILDE: Aye. BOUCHARD: All that with the girl and the priest from the Iroquois massacre out... MATHILDE: One is not related to the other. BOUCHARD: And what would the Hudson Bay man Goames say about this if I asked him? MATHILDE: You doubt the words of a widow? [SCOFFS] - BOUCHARD: Mathilde. - Hm. Apologies. Francis was... He was a particular man. The town will be made poorer without him. MATHILDE: And you will bring Gus Lafarge back to answer for what he has done to me? BOUCHARD: Of course. First I must report these events to Quebec City. The Intendant De Fer will not be happy with what has befallen Wobik these past weeks. That is a fierce wobble. Gus should stick to bending barrel staves. If there is more you wish to tell me, Mathilde, I would hear it. MATHILDE: No. That is all I wish to say. [CLEARS THROAT] YVON: We'll be wanting to know what you saw out there, Priest. FATHER CLAPE: Father. FATHER JEROME: We're here for Brother Clape. YVON: The company I work for needs to hear what the priest saw. FATHER JEROME: Father Clape will come with us. Now step away. Would you stab a priest? YVON: Depends on the priest, I suppose. This is my apple knife, for now. FATHER JEROME: Brother Clape will be seen to. And when he finds his tongue, we'll have his story. And bathe him in the wisdom of the Lord, so that he may be made whole again. [CHOPPING IN DISTANCE] [GRUNTING] TREPAGNY: Excellent work, Monsieur Sel. Come with me. There are more that need to be pulled from the sky. This way. RENÉ: I might be of help if you tell me what you're looking for. - TREPAGNY: A span of trees. - RENÉ: What sort of trees? TREPAGNY: Ones that will hold and reign over the rest. This is not that, do you agree? RENÉ: It depends. TREPAGNY: Yes. So much depends. Yes. Yes. This is the place, I'm sure of it. You see how these create a perfect form? RENÉ: Yes. TREPAGNY: Leave them. Clear the rest. RENÉ: What are we building? TREPAGNY: A sky table, these will be the legs. - RENÉ: Sky table? - TREPAGNY: Yes. I wish to stride over the trees and study the clouds and the smoke from Wobik. No man in New France will possess such a view. RENÉ: I have never heard of such a thing. TREPAGNY: I have invented it. I have made a sketch. There is now precedent for such a thing. RENÉ: I will start at once. TREPAGNY: I have been granted a wife by decree of the king, and I wish to complete the table before we are properly bound. RENÉ: What of Mari? TREPAGNY: Mari is not my wife. RENÉ: Sir. TREPAGNY: Oh. Worry not. 'Tis the Wendat. Bonjour! Tell me, Sel, what does a man such as yourself think of all day? Besides the bite of the axe, I mean. RENÉ: I think of nothing. TREPAGNY: Nonsense. The bird of thought enters us all. What vapors fill your mind? RENÉ: I think sometimes, uh... [CLEARS THROAT] of my brother. TREPAGNY: He who is dead? RENÉ: Yes. TREPAGNY: This is what families are like. The ones who have come and passed from this world push us to find new fields. It is the fear of departing this realm without leaving a mark. You must do better than this dead brother. You must set a course for yourself. RENÉ: I will start with this. TREPAGNY: And Mari must not know a word of this. Now, I need to be able to trust you. RENÉ: You have my word. TREPAGNY: Good. YVON: There you are. I do not like them, but they are good, for now. BOUCHARD: Mr. Goames. HAMISH: Gus Lafarge is dead. BOUCHARD: By your hand? HAMISH: No. He had the jump on me. I was done for. Then a man came out of the woods and ran him through with a stake. BOUCHARD: What man? HAMISH: It was dark. His flesh putrid. That is all I saw. BOUCHARD: You expect me to believe this tale? HAMISH: It is the truth. Lafarge is dead. YVON: Black robes took the priest. HAMISH: Lafarge's boy took the girl. BOUCHARD: There is no need for summary. My head aches with it. My men are out looking for the girl. She will be found and Gus's boy will be taken care of. YVON: Just like you took care of what happened out there on the creek? [CHUCKLES] BOUCHARD: He speaks for you? YVON: I speak for myself. BOUCHARD: Mr. Goames, you are a guest of King Louis of France. The Hudson Bay Company has no claim in this territory. HAMISH: I've been tasked in finding Mr. Cross, and I shall see that job through until I get a proper account. BOUCHARD: How? HAMISH: Well, maybe the girl saw something during the massacre. BOUCHARD: Aye... the bloody Iroquois. The very same ones feeding the crows down by the docks. YVON: They will be back to collect their dead. BOUCHARD: Now, I would remind you and your savage that the penalty for stepping beyond your place is death. Ask your questions, find your man Cross... or not... and then be gone. ♪♪ CHARLES: I... I have skill with both the French and English, I know their ways, their customs. I can help you with your trade in New France. [SPEAKING WYANDOT] [SOFT LAUGHTER] TEYARONHÏIO': Our village is full. Goodbye, French. CHARLES: No... No. No, please. No! HAWAHSTHA': Do you know how we judge a true warrior? If you can outrun my arrow, we'll know your worth. HÄA'TATOYENHK: Run, French. MELISSANDE: Tighter. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MOTHER SABRINE: What is the matter, child? DELPHINE: I'm terrified I'm going to choose wrong. MELISSANDE: Not I. I will have the one with the most land. MOTHER SABRINE: There is more to man than how much land they have to their name. Are they devout? Are they kind? MELISSANDE: Men are not kind. Not unless they want something. And then you keep it from them and drive them mad. MOTHER SABRINE: I believe there is good in all men. And the task of the woman is to draw it forth, to nurture it. DELPHINE: What would you know of men, Mother? MOTHER SABRINE: I'll have you know I was married before I took my vows. I was in love with the shopkeep's son, but my father married me to a widower. A sheep farmer with fat hands, who smelled of sheep shit and brandy. On my wedding night, I cried myself to sleep. He spoke not a word for three days, just pointed with his fat hands. "Food. Bed. Brandy". Then one night, there was a terrible storm. Lightning dropping onto the sheepfold, bright as day. We went to gather the flock into the barn and a bolt of lightning struck the oak tree in the center of the flock, where my husband stood. I was on a paved stone and spared. But the last thing I remember seeing was him pointing at me in the rain. MELISSANDE: Is the lesson don't marry a sheep farmer? [TITTERING] MOTHER SABRINE: Dress yourselves. We must ready the hall for the dance tonight. MOTHER SABRINE: Let us begin our work. Quickly. MELISSANDE: It's disgusting. DELPHINE: [SCOFFS] It could be worse. MOTHER SABRINE: Delphine. Those sacks. Shovel. Surely you know what to do with that. MELISSANDE: Mm, I've never used one in my life. MOTHER SABRINE: [LAUGHS] Do not attempt to lie to me about such a small thing as a shovel. Now work. Delphine, gather some flowers for the garden. We will touch this place up to a perfect shine. MELISSANDE: I will help her. MOTHER SABRINE: Be quick, then. MELISSANDE: Soon we will be free of Mother Sabrine and make our fortune. Isn't that why you came here? DELPHINE: My village was small. There was nothing for me there. MELISSANDE: And there will be nothing here unless you make something. Or else you never should have made the journey. DELPHINE: Aren't you afraid of what awaits us? MELISSANDE: I won't wait for anything, Delphine. I watched my mother wait her whole life. She's still there, in her chair in the kitchen, looking out at that dirt yard, watching the chickens hunt fleas. Huh? - DELPHINE: You saw Claudette's lot. - MELISSANDE: That is Claudette. It won't be me. If you put your mind to it, you can remake yourself here. TREPAGNY: Show me clearly the one you have chosen for me. Or speak her name, that I might know her upon first sight. A modest woman free of vanity whose greatest pleasure is to please. One with whom I might ascend on beams of the light. Very well. MARI: What are you going to town for? TREPAGNY: Business, Mari. MARI: I will wait for you. TREPAGNY: Do not. I will stay at the inn tonight. And when I return I will sleep here from now on. Not in your cabin. MARI: It is our cabin. Your son sleeps there. TREPAGNY: Then it will be made better for the room. [LAUGHS] Come. And one... And one. No, no, no, no. Have you forgotten everything I taught you? Again. MARI: [SIGHS] I do not want to dance. TREPAGNY: Mari, come. MARI: Release me. TREPAGNY: Mari. [SPITS] TREPAGNY: What have you done? Clean me up. COOKE: I... I cannot return to our house. I cannot enter it without thinking that you will be there instead of these trees that surround. CHARLES: Sir? [GRUNTS SOFTLY] CHARLES: I come in respect for the dead, sir, and in need of help. COOKE: Whose man are you? CHARLES: Monsieur Trepagny bought my contract and then released me. COOKE: You have run off. Say it. CHARLES: Yes, I have. COOKE: And now you pester me. The town is there. They will arrest you for desertion or worse, if that fool Trepagny demands it. CHARLES: I need only to make it to the docks for a boat back to France. COOKE: Passage to France requires coin. You plainly have none. CHARLES: Excuse me, sir. My apologies. Take this for the grave. COOKE: Is there no corner of this godforsaken land where I can be met with silence? You hold forth weeds and you burble empty words. You defile my departed's grave with your idiocy. CHARLES: Sir, whatever you need done, I will do. I've learned much from my time in the woods. COOKE: I can see that. CHARLES: How many men do you know who can connive an Indian out of clothes? They prepared a feast in my honor, I gained knowledge of their ways. COOKE: Get to your point. CHARLES: I can be of service to you. COOKE: But how, exactly? - HAMISH: I would like a word, Mr. Cooke. - [SIGHS] COOKE: Of course. HAMISH: Your man, Gus Lafarge. COOKE: Aye. What of him? HAMISH: Gus and his son ransacked the innkeeper. His boy Thom took the girl that we found at the creek settlement. COOKE: What happened at the inn was a tragedy, and Captain Bouchard will see to it and set it right. I am sure of it. HAMISH: The captain is nothing but a belly full of brandy and not the man to set anything right. Gus Lafarge is dead. I saw his end myself. COOKE: Come in. We shall have a cup of tea and discuss. HAMISH: Thank you. COOKE: Oh, may I? My wife used to prepare this for me every morning. She said the honey for the throat. And lavender for the eyes. I think you'll find it quite soothing. HAMISH: It's sufficiently hot. COOKE: Do not lie, Mr. Goames. I can see that it pleases you. HAMISH: Answers would please me more. Gus Lafarge is dead. A good result for you, I suppose. COOKE: He leaves behind a wife and son. I would hardly call that a good result. If he's dead, as you say. HAMISH: He is. Where's the boy? COOKE: Well, how would I know? Uh, what happened at the inn was not of my doing. HAMISH: This is about the creek massacre and your hand in it. COOKE: The Iroquois were the hand... they were put down. HAMISH: The Iroquois are easily guided to savagery. COOKE: Mr. Goames, do not take me for a Frenchman who harbors secrets. Now, you came here to look for your man Cross? HAMISH: Yes. COOKE: And the Company sent you? - HAMISH: They did. - COOKE: Tell me, who was it who tasked you with this mission? HAMISH: The name doesn't matter. COOKE: Though I recently parted from the Company, yet I have many friends in her bloody ranks. The name matters. HAMISH: What are you getting at, Cooke? COOKE: The Company did not send you here. If they had, you would know that what happened by the creek was your man Cross's idea. That's right, the massacre. The gathering and enticing of the Iroquois. HAMISH: I don't believe you. COOKE: Pardon me, sir, but I don't believe you. The Company did not send you. You're here for some other purpose. HAMISH: And what of it? Cross is married to my sister. Father to her son. His correspondence ended. So I came here to discover his whereabouts for my sister. That is the truth. COOKE: And yet... Cross is a Company man? HAMISH: To the bone. COOKE: Well, as a Company man yourself, you should know that it is their aim to grab land where they can create instability. And then move in, and take advantage of that instability. Your Cross was sent here to do that. HAMISH: You lie. COOKE: I'm afraid that I do not. He contacted me and asked me to partner with him on this. And, now, I am afraid I am left for the bill. So, you see, Mr. Goames, we are allies of a sort. HAMISH: We are no such thing. Where is Cross? COOKE: Well, I don't know, but he's probably dead. HAMISH: Well, if he is, you will be held accountable. COOKE: And how, exactly, will I be held accountable? This is New France. Where do you think you are? And what will the French do when they find out that a pack of English are behind this? Especially ones with ties to the Hudson Bay Company. That, to me, looks like an act of war. And they will round up and hang every British civilian they can find, including you. So, let us finish our tea like good British subjects. And then, perhaps, you should leave through the back door, and not give that drunkard Bouchard too many pieces to put together. [GRUNTING] MARI: What are you doing? RENÉ: My job. Trepagny said this plot is to be cleared, so... I will clear it. MARI: What for? RENÉ: A table. In the sky. You may ask him about it. MARI: Did he tell you what his business in town is for? RENÉ: No. MARI: It is for that woman. He told you this, I know. RENÉ: He told me nothing except to work and to clear this plot so he may build his table. MARI: And you do everything he says? RENÉ: That is my job. MARI: What else? RENÉ: Nothing. MARI: He's mad. [CHUCKLES] RENÉ: Yes. Yes, perhaps. MARI: He will bring unnatural things to settle here. I've seen what he does to men like you. You will die in this forest, Mr. Sel. Now, tell me. RENÉ: I have given my word to serve Monsieur Trepagny, and I will do so. Honorably. MARI: And what of me? RENÉ: Please... Mari... let me finish my work in peace. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] THOM: Mr. Cooke? COOKE: Ah. There you are, my boy. Uh, in here. Come. Sit. Are you all right? You all right? Did anyone see you? - THOM: No, sir. - COOKE: Ah. THOM: Is my father here? COOKE: No. No, he... he hasn't returned. Uh, is something wrong? THOM: I hurt the innkeep's wife. Stabbed her. COOKE: Where is the, um... that little girl? THOM: Uh, Mr. Trepagny showed up. And the little girl ran off. I'm truly sorry, Mr. Cooke. I suppose my father was just doing this job for you. COOKE: No! No. You are mistaken in that. [SHORT LAUGH] - Do you understand? - THOM: Yes, sir. - COOKE: Good. - THOM: Can you help me find my father? He did not show at the meeting place... COOKE: Oh, of course. Of course, Thom. But first we must hide you. You cannot go home after what happened at the inn. I will handle it. Now come with me. Stay in here till I take care of this. Not a peep. I will be back... with your father in no time. THOM: Yes, sir. COOKE: I should report your whereabouts to Captain Bouchard. CHARLES: But you won't. COOKE: Don't get clever with me. CHARLES: Clever would be asking about the boy in the shed. I am twice as clever to know that would be a bad thing. But if a man were to have a job watching that shed, might that prove his worth to you? COOKE: It might. CHARLES: Then I shall watch like a hawk. COOKE: Do not double-cross me. [MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE] MELISSANDE: Did you expect a prince? DELPHINE: They're old. MELISSANDE: Where does a lady begin? DELPHINE: What are we supposed to do? MELISSANDE: This is our chance to size up their offer. The one on the end is quite taken with you. DELPHINE: He has a kind face and not so old, I guess. MELISSANDE: Go, talk to him. Remember what to ask. His land, what sort of house he keeps. DELPHINE: The men should step forward first, no? MELISSANDE: Mother Sabrine said it is to be our choice. Go. - Be bold. - [KNOCKING] BOUCHARD: Men of Wobik... I am watching all of you. So, mind yourselves! These women are the property of Good King Louis. And it is by his grace they stand before you, ready for matrimony - in the name of New France. - [MAN WHOOPING] MOTHER SABRINE: Present yourselves. I believe some wine might help. [MUSIC STARTS] - MAN: Hi. - ANGÉLIQUE: Bonjour. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MELISSANDE: That's better. DELPHINE: Wish me luck. MELISSANDE: And me, good fortune. [MUSIC STOPS] TREPAGNY: Let the tournament of love begin. Ladies. I am Claude Trepagny. No man in this room has as much land as I, nor as fine a house, and my Doma is without equal. Soon it will eclipse poor Wobik. Now, let me see. Ah, yes. What is your name? - ISABELLE: Isabelle. - TREPAGNY: Isabelle, enchanté. - ISABELLE: Enchanté. - TREPAGNY: You are very beautiful. And you? CHARLOTTE: Charlotte. TREPAGNY: It was my mother's name. CHARLOTTE: Oh. [GIGGLES] TREPAGNY: Magnificent perfume. Merci. - CHARLOTTE: Oh. [GIGGLING] - TREPAGNY: [SNIFFS] BOUCHARD: Trepagny. Hey, give the ladies some air. They've likely had enough of your preening. TREPAGNY: I will give them more than air. Here. Now, spices and lumps of sugar from the Indies, enough for every lovely lady here to enjoy a taste. Voilà, please. Help yourselves. [MUSIC STARTS PLAYING] Isabelle, where are you from? ISABELLE: My mother is from Paris, sir. TREPAGNY: And your father, what are his holdings? Um... TREPAGNY: I see. Charlotte, from where have you come to this new land? CHARLOTTE: Gascony. - TREPAGNY: [GASPS] - CHARLOTTE: My father holds an orchard. TREPAGNY: Oh, really? Peach, pear, apple? - Quince. - TREPAGNY: Quince. Right. And who is this divine creature? - ANGÉLIQUE: Angélique. - TREPAGNY: Angélique. Enchanté. ANGÉLIQUE: Enchanté. TREPAGNY: You have such fine hair. It shines like the sun. ANGEÉLIQUE: Thank you. MOTHER SABRINE: Do something. BOUCHARD: Well, Trepagny has a letter. He's entitled to be considered by the filles. MOTHER SABRINE: I shall talk to him if you won't. TREPAGNY: Good Lord, Mother, you have blocked my marvelous vision with your godly face. MOTHER SABRINE: You made your ridiculous entrance, now make your exit. [SCOFFS] TREPAGNY: Now, if you will excuse me, I have seen my wife. ♪♪ [MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE] TREPAGNY: Three years it required, and, uh, months to clear the stumps, but now, in every direction, I have a vista. And, uh, from the well to the backdoor is 17 steps. And then, in the spring, flocks of yellow butterflies settle in the garden and turn everything golden. You can watch them as you are doing the laundry or cooking the supper. DELPHINE: Uh... the beasts of the forest there... are they shy or bold? TREPAGNY: Shy in the daytime, less so in the night. But don't worry, my men and I are very watchful. DELPHINE: Y-Your men, you said? How many? TREPAGNY: Oh. Um... Captain. The lady here requires reassurance. Now, you have toured my Doma and dined in my château... has there, uh, ever been any kind of trouble? BOUCHARD: It is a unique place, that is to be sure. TREPAGNY: You see, even the good Captain agrees it is like Eden, chérie. DELPHINE: Your home is-is not a cabin or a house, but a complete château? [TREPAGNY SIGHS] TREPAGNY: I fear I misspoke. I have no château because I have no wife, and it is the woman who makes a house. We have made your friend jealous. We should speak more softly. Like you, Claude Trepagny has many rivals here, some of them sworn to ruin him with lies. DELPHINE: Maybe it is your boasting that arouses them. TREPAGNY: Truthfully, Delphine, sometimes I fear it is my hat. FATHER JEROME: Answer me. You spoke of Azazel. [EXCLAIMS] What happened out there, Father Clape? FATHER CLAPE: Iroquois... and others. FATHER JEROME: Did they eat the flesh off men? Answer me. FATHER CLAPE: Please. FATHER JEROME: Who started the fire? Who burned our dead? - [GROANS] - It was you! [GRUNTS] FATHER JEROME: You saw the devil! - ♪♪ - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - MELISSANDE: Monsieur Trepagny. - TREPAGNY: Mm-hmm? MELISSANDE: My name is Melissande de Saint Remy, daughter of Comtede Saint Remy, Baron de Fontette. Descended from the fourth mistress of the last Valois king. TREPAGNY: I, too, am of ancient blood. Enchanté. MELISSANDE: I'm not from the Paris streets nor the muddy countryside, - as you can plainly see. - TREPAGNY: Yes. MELISSANDE: I would like more. If you are above filling a lady's cup, you are not the man for me, Monsieur Trepagny. TREPAGNY: I am not above at all. Voilà. MELISSANDE: You, Monsieur Trepagny, are anything but common. You should enjoy a more complex spirit. One where the flavor changes from the moment you taste it to the moment you swallow. You need a good wife. One befitting a man with your vision. One who might share that vision and rise up to greatness. TREPAGNY: Yes. MELISSANDE: Other girls have assets that catch the eye now, but they will fade with time. Blood, land, what we make and grow from it is what will be left when we're gone. The realm of Heaven sits just above the trees. I have seen birds ascend and not return. Bees transformed into balls of light. Would you like to see such a place? MELISSANDE: We will see. Fill another woman's cup and return to me with your report. TREPAGNY: But... [GRUNTING] HENRI: Mr. Cooke! Come! Get your man. - BOUCHARD: Open the gate. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: [GASPS] Oh, God! Monsieur Lafarge! BOUCHARD: Cut him down! [ALL MURMURING] Get a ladder. Hurry! [CROWD GASPS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] COOKE: I have another job for you, Mr. Duquet, one I will pay you famously for. - CHARLES: What is it? - COOKE: Take the boy into the woods. He must, uh, not return. CHARLES: Lose him? COOKE: No. You want a job? CHARLES: I do. COOKE: This... is the job on offer. Do we have a deal? CHARLES: Yes. COOKE: Oh. Thom, are you all right? THOM: Have you found my father? COOKE: We have, Thom. He's-he's quite fine. He's fine. This is my friend, Mr. Duquet. He will take you to him. You need to go. By the back gate, be quick. Go. Go, go. ♪♪ MATHILDE: My little fox. You have come back to me. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] ♪♪ CHARLES: Hurry, boy. Your father is just up the path. He'll be glad to see you return safe. Just a little further. Come. THOM: How is my father? CHARLES: He's fine, as will you soon be. Now, why don't you go in front so that you'll be the first to see him. - THOM: He's going to be cross with me. - CHARLES: No. I've spoken to him about this very matter already. - THOM: You have? - CHARLES: Yes. All will be fine. Now, be quick.
