 Thank you. Oh Henri, I'm going to keep this forever. Race you. Some say I was destined to be the greatest ballerina of all time. I had no idea what was about to happen. How could I? How could anyone? My parents sent me from Russia to the Paris Opera Ballet School when I was eight years old. (classical music plays) (audience applauds) (muted music plays in the background) We take her back to Russia. Tonight. I don't know what the fuss is about. She's behind by an eighth. How can someone so... so unmannered in real life be so graceful on stage? (audience applauds) Oh, Claudine! Wait till you go out there. There's nothing like it. You were wonderful. But mind yourself. You're so exuberant. I'm sorry. I'm just so excited and nervous. I'm so glad I didn't mess up. I was behind by an eighth. You were? I didn't notice. (knock on the door) Go. I'll cover for you. You were amazing. Well, I had my good luck charm, didn't I? What? I overheard they're taking you back to Russia. Oh no. Go. I'll take care of my mother alone. Go. Pack your things. Your father's waiting outside. We'll return to Russia immediately. Mother, please. You saw me dance. I have a chance to make Company. Must I remind you that you are Princess Helena Grisky? You humiliated the family by running around with a simple peasant. How did you... Your roommate had enough sense to post a letter. I had never cared about being a princess. None of that mattered to me. Only to my parents. All I cared about, was ballet. It's over. No more ballet. In that one moment, in that one statement, my entire life changed. How could you? I made the decision to change the path I was born to be on. I had no idea of the impact that decision would have. It would change... everything. I guess this is goodbye. I need to get my things. And then I'm leaving. Come with me. Come on. Are you mad? Possibly. (laughter) That is some getaway outfit. Well, I didn't have time to change my shoes, did I? Not if I wanted to escape my mother. Halt. Who goes there? Quick. This way. (laughter) My mother's guards. Run. Hey. Hey. Lena? Come on. What are you doing? Open the door. What? (ticking and magical tinkling noises) Henri? Where are you? Henri? Whoa, watch where you're going. I don't know. Where am I? Get into the line. We're next. What is she doing here? Who is she? Where did she come from? Look at her dress. Wow. Gutsy. Wish I had thought of it. Wait. What's happening? (audience laughs and mutters in shock) (audience laughs) Help me. I need to get out of here. Please. Get off of me. Where's Henri? What are you doing? Where is he? Help me, help me. I need to get out of here. Get out. What's wrong with her? Lena? Son... What have you done? (announcer) It is our pleasure to introduce the Paris Opera Ballet, esteemed company and budding class of 2018. 2018? What is 2018? Wow, you are taking stage fright to a wickedly elevated level. It's 2018. Like the year of... Year? 2018 is the year? Oh my... Oh, are you okay? (audience mutters) Is she hurt? Back up, back up. Give her some room. Who is she? What is she wearing? This is the Défilé, not a costume party. Don't move. What's your name? I'm Helena Gr... Elena Grande? From Italy? We didn't expect you for a few more days. Ines, get the medic. Okay, so she's a total drama queen. No, you don't understand. It's alright. Don't move. It's okay. (Henri pants) Tell me exactly what happened. We were just running through the hall and then... she went through the door and she just disappeared. Where is it? The door. We were just in front of it. No, I mean the necklace. Hm... It's on Lena's neck. I gathered. Where did you find it? It's actually quite a funny story. (whistles) (sneezes) Wow. It's just an old necklace. Why are you giving me the "you're in deep trouble" look? Come with me. You have no idea what you've done. I have no idea at all what is happening right now. You've sent her spiraling through time. At least, you haven't lost your sense of humor. I was waiting until you were older to tell you. Until you had proven to me that you were mature enough to handle it. Son... We're time travelers. What? But, Dad, how is that possible? Time travel, that's crazy. What is this? Our family has been time traveling for centuries. But there are rules. And you managed to break them all. I'm going after her. Well, I'll come with you. No, you won't. You're not authorized to travel. You've already set in motion events that can't be undone. I need to get a few things. You stay here. She went through the Garnier portal so we know where she landed. We just don't know when. What do you mean? She could be in 1575 or 2030. We don't know. You will find her, right? Elena, good morning. You really hit your head there. But luckily, no concussion. Where is Henri? I must find him. Is she okay to dance, because they're calling us to class, like stat. Hi, I'm Ines. I'm your roommate. Wow, your bun is a total disaster. Have you got a brush? No, I... Whoa. For real? You've got to let her dance, Nurse D. You know what it means if she doesn't. This is the audition for Gabrielle's exclusive workshop. Gives you a leg up in competish, right? This is like the Grand Prix of the Paris Opera Ballet School. I'm back at the school? No, we're still at the Garnier, but we'll go to school later. I have to go. Now. I need to go and find... See? She's totally ready. Okay, but if you feel faint... She'll tell me and I'll tell you. It'll go down all legal and legit. Okay, Nurse D? Okay, but I'm trusting you with this, Ines. Impressive entrance you made. Fainting right in the middle of the Défilé in your red dress like that. It's like, welcome to the class of 2018, and you were like... aah. I have to go. Come on. Let's get you dressed. (students chatter on phone) (phone beeps) (phone beeps) Why is everyone talking to themselves? (hip-hop beat starts to play) What's wrong with him? Yeah, I know. That's Jeff. He's new too. Haven't figured him out yet, but he is a sick dancer. Oh no, he's ill? (Ines sniggers) Whoa, whoa. Hold up. Where do you think you're going? We haven't even jammed yet. Come on. You know... Uh... Uh... Yeah... You just gotta let loose. Yeah. Yeah, You feel me? How dare you speak to me that way? Just relax. This is our five minutes of fun before it all gets totally real. Go on. Try it. (Jeff beatboxes) (others laugh) (music starts again) Oh. Now you. Whoa... Whoa. Careful, chica. We don't want you to fall again, do we? Hi. Yes, I erm... As you were. You are broadcasting your crush allover the place. Hello. Oh. (others laugh) Are you trying to make a run for it now? Oh, are you an officer of the law? If you're not prepared to leave your souls on the stage each and every time you step onto it, then you need to question whether or not you want to be here. This workshop is an honor and a privilege. After the break we'll start with your unique pieces. Who is she? Gabrielle Carré. I mean, come on. Only the best prima ballerina ever. And she's the Directrice of the school, so... No presh. Oh, hello. I was just using this fascinating hand-drier. What's your deal? Like, for real. You come in here all doe-eyed and fainty. Who do you think you are? Oh, I'm Lena Grisky. Very funny. You can try and wow everyone with your gimmicks and your diversions, but you don't fool me. This is my turf and I won Dance Off. So it's my destiny to make Company and be the best. So whatever this is, it stops. Now. Break's over. Let's go, guys. What are you waiting for? I don't belong here. I must find a way to get back. Why do you think I'm here? Come on. Where is she? I don't know. Speak up. I asked you a question. Where is my daughter? Honestly, Your Highness. She was here. And now she's not. (scoffs) Arrest him. Alex. Don't be ridiculous. They're children, playing a game. We both know Lena put him up to this. You know your daughter. Her favorite defiance is running away. Come now. Where is she? Sir, I have no idea. (scoffs) (hurried footsteps) Okay, so Lena's parents think she's run away. Apparently, it's a pattern. That will only hold for a bit. I'm going after her while no one is around. There is one other thing. What? We're vampires too? Beware of the Time Collectors. What? Listen to me. You've opened the portal, so they'll be after you and Lena. They were last seen in the 18th century. They stand out. Stay away from them. Run, hide, whatever it takes. And don't you go anywhere. Your instincts lead you to trouble. Question. What exactly are they collecting? You, Lena. And all the other timepieces. So they're the bad guys? I have to go now, while the portal is still open. Portal? Dad, are you a quantum spy? (grunts) So the door is a portal. Lena, where did you go? (pop song plays) Oh no. No, I mean I must return to where I came from. I believe I came through a door. You're weird. And kind of hilarious. Come on. ♪ Let your thoughts go their way ♪ ♪ Let them out again ♪ ♪ If the sun is fading away ♪ ♪ Let it shine again ♪ (new song starts) ♪ I've been around so many places ♪ ♪ Came to know these fading faces ♪ ♪ But everywhere I arrive ♪ ♪ She leaves me far behind ♪ I don't get the whole Max Alverez thing but... clearly you're crushing. Rumor has it he had no formal ballet training before coming here a few years ago. Like zero. But he can dance, I'll give him that. Get this. He went to Harrow Boarding School. Totally posh. But he got kicked out or something. He's got secrets. You can tell. And P. S., he's Thea's guy. And she already doesn't like you, so... She doesn't? Is there something I can do to change her mind? I could send her a note of apology. Yeah, a note. That'll help. Okay. Anyway... His mum was English and his dad was Spanish. But then there was this tragic accident and... They died. Oh, that's so sad. Yeah. Apparently, he's got this massive trust fund. One girl last year said he might be related to the Royals. But I think that's just gossip. I guess he got sent to his aunt and she turned him on to ballet. Hey... I'm serious. Thea's guy. Okay? Hey, new girl. How are you doin'? Much better, thank you. Good. Okay. So, erm... I'm Dash. She probably didn't even mention me, did she? To be honest, I'm not even sure she knows my name. You're up, Ines. Oh yeah, she knows my name. (rock song plays) Ah, she's amazing. Wow, I'm striking out today. A colored picture. She looks like Lena's mother. 'Victor, the Time Collectors have done more damage than I thought possible. We will not see each other again. I will protect my half with my life as I'm sure you will do with yours. They have caught our friend and I'm afraid he will never return.' (worried) Lena... 'Dear Lena. I have a strong hope this message will get to you. I will put it in our special place on the roof. I hope you will go there and think about the ways we always communicated. The chimney. My father says it is magic.' Oh Henri. (sobs) Where are you? (tinkling noise) (Henri) 'My dear Lena. My family has a secret. I didn't know. Of course I would've told you if I did. The good news is that we are not vampires.' Henri, just spit it out. 'We're time travelers. And now, so are you.'
