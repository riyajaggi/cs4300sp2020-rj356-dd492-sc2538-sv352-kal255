 ♪ It's time to show myself what I can be ♪ ♪ Figure out my life and still be me ♪ ♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up and welcome to my world ♪ -(Lena) Previously... -(Henri) It's magic. Henri gave me a necklace... -Perfect! That made me travel to the future... 2018 is the year. Everything is so different here. -Are those trousers? -Are you Amish? Lucky for me I still receive his letters through our secret brick. But now I have to convince everyone I'm a regular teenager and stay hidden from the Time Collectors. I hope I'll be back home soon. (Gabrielle) What is going on?

 (students whisper) Whoa... (laughs) Total plot twist. So, if she's Elena Grande... (sniggers) ...then who are you? That is a fair question, Miss...? I can explain, I... I was... It's very complicated... Hard to explain the situation... Good morning. (Gabrielle) Yes? Forgive me for interrupting, but I have paperwork for Lena Grisky. Sorry it's late. The computer had a glitch. It's nice to meet you, Lena. I apologize for putting you in a rather awkward situation. Let me know if you need anything. Anything at all. (Henri) 'This is going to be a bit of a head exploder, but if you get in trouble, there is someone who can help. He went looking for you. Find Victor. My father.' (to herself) Henri's father... (horses neigh) (church bells ring) Our family's chronicles of time travel... 'The timepiece is special. It's coveted. And the one who wears it, the rightful owner, is the chosen one. You must be very careful when traveling with this timepiece. Because this timepiece is special, it's possible to trick the Time Collectors and hide from them. The inside of this timepiece has a dial, and if you follow the instructions carefully, it has proved to be very helpful for some.' (Henri) 'Dear Lena, here is a plan to use your timepiece to get rid of the Time Collectors forever. Follow these instructions and you'll scatter them. My father wouldn't let me travel with him, but my big plan is to trick the Time Collectors to bring me to your time. I know they hang by the portal.' (groans, then sighs) Going somewhere, Henri? I thought we were taking him hostage. (scoffs) (groans) 21st century, here we come. We talked about this. Don't tell the plan to the man. Yep. We did? Don't tell the plan to... Oh, check... Oh! (swooshing and ticking clock noises) There's no questioning her talent. That's certainly not the concern. But why did she answer to Elena Grande? She didn't. She must've said Lena. I just assumed. I'm sorry. Where is she from? She trained in Russia. Do the details really matter? This isn't a school that only recognizes prestige, is it? Certainly not. Talent comes first. Look her up. Now. Okay. Ohhh. She's so pretty. (nervously) I mean... if you're into that kind of thing. No way... (students gasp and whisper) Whoa. But why didn't she correct you? She's had ample opportunity. Miss Grisky is frightfully shy. She wouldn't dare correct an authority figure. Her family? Tragic. They died in a fire a few years ago. She has no one. A benefactor is providing the tuition, but can't care for her. What a tragedy. Of course she'll remain here, in our care. Excellent. (whispers) Not a word to anyone. You'll stay here until further instruction. It's crucial that you blend in. (footsteps approaching) (normal voice) All is taken care of, Miss Grisky. I wish you well with your studies. Wait! When do I get to go home? Why aren't we leaving right now? I can't explain right now. I'll send word. Bree, how you pass your classes is beyond me. This isn't even her, it's from 1905! Sure looks like her. Well, that's impossible. (gasps) What if it's her great great grandmother or someone like that? So she's from Royalty? Named after some princess from a hundred years ago? What does that make her, some kind of duchess or something? Well? No. -Yes. No. -Yes. No? -No? Well, find... out. I don't know anything about the Russian monarchy. There's zero record of her at any big dance academies. She was probably home-schooled. Taught by some famous choreographer who gave her private lessons in a castle! And she probably has a crown! And she probably paid her way in here! Cool your jets, Thea. Stop being such a drama queen. This is war. I've been betrayed. Yeah... I'm not sure how this is about you. I bet Elena Grande's furious. I'm sure she knows it's a misunderstanding and is working it out with the office. And I'm sure it's a scam. Phones away, or I'll toss them in the garbage. Lena, please take your place. So together you will choreograph a piece about yourself and perform it for the school. With a criminal. And a pageant queen. It was a dance competition. (Copies) 'It was a dance competition.' Must I remind you what a privilege it is to be in my workshop? No? Good. Now. Tell us who you are, through dance. (Dash) OK, let's work on the assignment. Alright, I'll start. Give me a beat. (students snap their fingers) I'm Dash. Short for Dashing. Tsss! Nope. I'm from London. My grandmother taught a dance class in the courtyard of our building and let me dance with them. I'm Lena. Grisky. I'm from the pa... Erm, I trained with erm... Could I have some music, please? (Jeff beatboxes) (students clap) She'll never keep up. That much is crystal clear. (Dash) Yeah! (Laughs) I'm Max Alverez. No one in my family wanted me to dance, so... no lessons, no formal training. I taught myself everything I know. (students talking) May I sit here? Of course. Sit. So you must be, like, sick rich, huh? I feel fine, thank you. I'm not ill, it's just a slight malaise from the misunderstanding earlier. No. I just meant you're from like, a fancy family. (thud) What? I just wanna get to know her. For the dance. Oh yes. Do tell us all about yourself. It's so fascinating how somebody can be one person, and then poof! Seconds later, they can be somebody totally different. How do you know about my family? Have they contacted you? Erm... no. That would be weird. So... royalty. How fascinating. It's not really something I'm comfortable discussing. Will you leave her alone? You jerks are being obnoxious. (snaps her fingers) (Lena) Thank you. (sighs) (reads to herself) 'Helena Grisky mysteriously disappeared from the Paris Opera Ballet in 1905.' (magical tinkling noise) I love Paris 2018! So full of first-rate foods! Ah, give us a sniff, Pinky! (sniffs) Are you joking? We have work. We need to plan. And execute. Not eat. Alright, I've got an idea. And it's a good one, I must say. He writes her little postcards, doesn't he? (Sniggers) Victor. (phone) How can I help you? -(gasps) Hello? Hello. How can I help you? I don't know. Who are you? I don't understand "who are you?" I'm Lena Grisky. I'm sorry. I can't find "rena crispy". Have you been sent to help? I'm in a bit of a situation. (door opens) Okay. You need to spill it. Who are you? I am sorry. I don't understand your situation. Yeah. That makes two of us. She was inside... the black rectangle thing. Lena. You need to spill it. I'll give this to you if you level with me. I'm sure you wanna hear what your Amish boyfriend Henri has to say. (reads) 'I've come for you. Meet me outside. All my love, Henri.' Where did you get this? It was taped to the door. But Lena listen. I can't continue to defend you to every single... Lena, wait! -Henri! (Henri) Lena! Lena! Henri! Lena, stop! It's a trap! Find my plan in the chimney on the Garnier roof! Go to the brick! Run, Lena! Lena! Lena, run! (Henri) Lena! (both out of breath) OK. You better start talking. Like, stat. Okay. I'm a Russian princess from 1905. I'm Helena Grisky. Like, the exact one that disappeared. I'm a time traveler. Wow. I know. This must sound fantastical. But one minute I was in 1905, and then the next I'm on the stage... At the Défilé. Henri. He gave me this timepiece. But he didn't know it was an actual time machine. We seem to be able to communicate by putting letters into a loose brick on the roof of the Garnier. He said he left something there. But how did he get here? This is incredible. I know. It's very hard to believe. But please, you have to trust me. I'm not crazy. Or maybe I am. Maybe this is all a dream. OK, I need to sit down. And what about the Three Musketeers? The Time Collectors. They're after me, but I'm not sure why. I'm sure Henri has arranged a safe passage to get me home. Back to 1905. Okay. For reals. We need to work on how you talk, because it's a total giveaway. What? (Laughs) This is so cool! What? You believe me? That I'm a time traveler? Well, quantum physics is kinda my jam. You went missing in 1905, I looked you up. You can tell that by looking at me? Well... yeah. But your picture was on the web page so... I don't know what a web page is, but I'm so grateful. Shall we go to the Garnier now? Erm... Tomorrow. It's past curfew. But you have to make it back in time for the performance or you'll get kicked out of the school for sure. And if you get kicked out of the school, then you'll really have nowhere to go. We need a plan to get you on that roof. Lena? Are you listening? Trying to help you out, here. (phone beeps) Uh-huh... But this is so amazing. Look, you match these candies and then you get points. And then there's more candies and then there's more points! It's just endless. Sorry. I'm... I'm listening. I've just never seen anything like that in my entire life. Okay. Are you a good actress? Cause you're gonna have to fake an illness to get out of class. Hm, I did a production of the Twelfth Night once. Okay, great. Once you're out, we'll communicate via text. And that's the word thing? Or is that the face page thing where they post about what they're doing and what they've had for breakfast? The word thing. Texting. Have I overloaded you? No, I've got it. 'Hello, Ines. Please texting me!' (laughs) Text. Just, text me. Yes, right. Cool, dude. (laughs) (phone beeps) (gasps) It... it worked! It worked! So what? (laughs) We couldn't grab her in front of people, we've been exposed. She'll keep looking for him. We'll make him cooperate next time. You should try these macaroons. They're heaven in tiny bites. Fine. Be a pouter. (Lena) Ouchhh... (Ines) You okay Lena? Suddenly, I feel quite ill. Oh, my royal constitution is so delicate. It must be something you ate. I told you about that smoked salmon. Miss Grisky, Ines will take you to the nurse. This cardigan is itchy. Never say cardigan again. That word died decades ago, along with your vocab. Got it. Maybe I should come with you. No, it's risky enough that I'm leaving. You've been so kind. Thank you. Those dudes. If you see them, run. Run as fast as you can and text me. And I'll find you, okay? Okay. You are a wickedly cold girl. (laughs) Almost. Ines. Thank you. I'll be back in time for the performance. (groaning) I say we just go get her. And I say, we have to go with the plan! I say we go roller skating! Shhhh! You can't catch me! Get him! Ah! (footsteps) (pop music plays) If her royal highness is still pretending to be sick, I can keep going. (Ines) Are you Madame Carré now? No, but I am the lead. There are no lead parts. You know what I mean. Where have you been? We should just have a transition that fills Lena's place. (Ines) Actually that's not a bad idea. No, not yours. Yours. It says more about you than you think, Thea. You know, the constant need to be the center of attention. (Dash laughs) That's quite good actually. Thea, end with one of your killer arabesques. (Jeff) Oh, beautiful. (all giggle) I told you she wouldn't show up. She will. Let's just cut her part, she doesn't deserve it anyway. Yes I do. Holy to the moly. Are you okay? I need to tell you what happened. (magical tinkling noise) (Lena) I went to the brick and found the letter from Henri. It was his plan to get rid of the Time Collectors. He would lead us all to the same place so I could use my timepiece to scatter them. But Henri doesn't always have well-thought-out plans. Get her! 'Set the dials to this formation. If it works, it will scatter the Time Collectors. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I have to hope it will give us a chance. The journal says it can trick them. Cross your fingers!' (exhales) (Ines) The show is starting, tell me more later. (pop music plays) ♪ I'll give you something Something ♪ ♪ I'll give you something Something ♪ ♪ I'll give you something ♪ Henri! Lena! Set your timepiece! Get her! Use the scatter! Do it, Lena! We have no other choice! Wait! Stop, Lena! You don't understand the power! (Henri) Press the button, Lena! (gasps) (Henri pants) (gasps) Whoa. What happened? Where is Henri? Why are we back in 1905? 1905... Henri? Where are you? (dramatic pop music plays) (audience applauds) (Thea whispers) You were supposed to wear black. What's wrong with you? So did the plan work? Where's Henri? He's gone. It worked. Henri, please... Find me in Paris. (dramatic music plays)
