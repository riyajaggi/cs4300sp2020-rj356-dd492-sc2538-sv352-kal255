 My name is Lena Grisky and I go to the best ballet school in the world. I have a secret. I'm a time traveler from 1905 and my boyfriend Henri is doing everything he can to get me home. Previously... Thea has happily taken over my life in 1905. I'm princess Grisky, forget what you've learned in ballet. One two three four. Pinky invited Henri to stay at the Time Collectors' apartment. Here we are, make yourself at home. And Henri has discovered he has a gift for music. As for Pinky, he's secretly working with Ines on the portal.

 I want to see the portal that you built last year. Absolutely. Oh, and Isaac found out about the BLOK. "Thea, I'm sorry we fought the other day, but there's no need for the radio silence. I need to know if you're okay. Have you managed to fit in? Probably not, you've probably fallen flat on your face, but I can help! I know we have our differences, but we're doing everything we can to get you back." Thea's a million times better than her cousin Lena could ever have dreamed of being. Bravo! Can you believe this? They love me! What a rush! You made the front page. Oh, my... "Thea Grisky, a born star.

 We've never had a student like her at the Paris Opera Ballet School. She's breathtakingly exquisite and seems to come from another world." Thea Grisky? She's stealing my name! "In her spare time, Thea finds enjoyment in teaching her new friends a delightful new dance she's invented called "Hippity‐Hop"." She's stealing my life. This stops now! We need to get Thea back, like, yesterday. Henri, you're not going to believe this. Lena! How's it going? Where's Henri? Is he here? Henri? Oh... Nope. Well, where is he then? Isn't he staying here? Uhm... I have no idea where he is, actually. He's a free man about town. He could be anywhere... really. Oh, come on, man. That's the master key. It opens everything. Oh well, then I'd start talking if I were you. He's staying with... It... It's a place for... It's like a time travel... hotel. And when did this happen? Literally just happened. Literally. Uh‐uh... Well, thanks. Bye‐bye now! "Sorry, Henri. Lena outsmarted me. She's on her way over." So, anyone up for doing anything today? Maybe an epic video game challenge? Or maybe a run? No? Nothing? Should I continue talking to myself, or... I know you're not thrilled with me being your roommate. I don't really care. You'll never get where you want to be wasting your time with that street stuff. Don't know what you're talking about. Whatever... What is your deal? You think people don't know about it. But they do. We heard about it in London. Don't believe everything you hear. Hmmm... Think you can fix it? Depends. I need to see if my coordinates match and I need a wrench. How did you get so smart? Genetics. How did you get so beautiful? Wrench? Yep! Coming right up! Okay. Whatever you do, don't tell you‐know‐who. Oh... Oh no! Lena's on her way! She can't see us with Pinky! Where have you been? And why didn't you tell me you moved? Uhm... Oh, yeah, Oscar found me a permanent place to live. It's kind of like a time travelers' boarding house. Oh, well, that's good. I'm steaming mad right now. You'll never guess what happened. Thea's completely taking over my life in 1905. Only it's worse than that, because she's bringing stuff from my modern life back there with her. Oh, You don't say. What do you mean by "taking over"? What's in there? What are you hiding? Hiding? Ha ha! Why would I ever hide anything from you, Lena? Why are you yelling in my face? Aren't you going to let me in, then? Henri Duquet, where are your manners? Into the living room, Lena? Well, of course. Is this a game? This place is quite nice, isn't it? I don't understand why we don't just tell her we're working together? Are you insane? Because you're the enemy. Why don't you have a seat? No, not there. Okay, okay. What is with you today? You know, Thea told everyone she's a Grisky. A Grisky. I'm a Grisky. Me. Not her. She stole my name Get her out of here. Can you believe her? Get her out of here! Get her out of here! Get who out of where? You've not seen that? It's a moving picture. It's brilliant, it's about a ghost that uhm... What did he say? ...lives in this haunted mansion and there is a family, and the family are trying to get her out of there. What are you talking about? I don't know. Okay, Thea? Yeah! Thea's teaching the girls, my girls, including nasty Claudine, hip‐hop! Hip‐hop in 1905! Get her out of here. I'm trying! Oh, I'm sorry, am I boring you? No. Not at all. I'm sorry. I am tired, I didn't sleep very well last night. Shht! What is going on today? I can't find Ines and you're acting weird. What was that? The... Ah... Guitar! Henri! That's amazing! Is he going to play her a whole concert? He's really good though. Awesome. I'll tell Thea we missed the window to save her because of Henri's music. You're so cheeky. You're so good! Don't stop! Why didn't you tell me about this? Oh, I... I sort of thought I did. Oh, would you look at the time! You seem really upset about this Thea thing but you need to deal with it right now. So let me give you some advice. If you want to beat Thea, you have to beat her at her own game. Okay, so why don't you go and think about that. Pop! Off you go, then. Okay, you really are acting super weird, but you know what? You're right. I'm going to beat Thea at her own game. Thank you, Henri. And we're going to talk about this whole situation later. Sure. Where have you been? We were supposed to rehearse this morning. Come on. I have an idea. A great one, which you might not like at first, but I think if you give it a chance, you'll love it as much as I do. Uh‐uh? What if we audition the BLOK for Dance Off? If Thea could win that thing all by herself, surely the BLOK could win! Have we met? As if I'd take the BLOK on some lame cheesy TV show like Dance Off. Don't tell Thea I said that. Come on, I think it could be totally great. We'd wear our masks. No one would even know. Uhm, except for my Dad. Lena. I've got plans for the BLOK. And they don't involve Dance Off or being expelled by the great Armando Castillo. Fine. I'm going to be a better Thea than Thea could ever be. What does that even mean? Lena, we have rehearsal! Pinky? Can you get him out of here so I can work in peace, please? What am I supposed to do with him? I don't know. Maybe try getting him some clothes from this century? Hey, mate, why don't we give the genius over here a little space to work, eh? Yeah. I'll be out in a minute. Look after her. Okay, now let's take a double selfie! Oh, yeah. I'm so totally posting this. Hey, Lena. Thea just texted and asked us to send her some stuff. So, we're just taking pictures to make sure it's the right stuff. Totally. Good one! Never mind that. You said you wanted a new leader? Well, guess what? What? I'm it! No... Way. That's a big way, girls! I don't understand. Frank took so many shortcuts. It doesn't make any sense. O.M.G.! It works! What? Oh my... Oh... I just don't know about this. It feels very uncivilized. Have you got anything without a million scissor teeth... Mate, if you want to impress your modern girlfriend, you have to get with the times. Here, try this. Okay... See? That's what I'm talking about! Yeah. Oh! It's Ines. She got the portal working! Ha... Oh, come on. Come on, Lena! Pick up! Pick up! I can't believe it! This is amazing! I knew you'd fix it. But how? It doesn't matter. I don't know how long the power's going to last, but I can't get a hold of Lena. I want to wait for her to make a plan though, right? I'll go. I'll get Thea and I'll bring her back. I know 1905. I know exactly where to look for her. No way, not a chance. I'm doing whatever she says. Lena! Finally! I have huge BLOK news! Wait, I need to tell you something! Okay, but hurry, I have to tell you something! O.M.G. But I haven't even told you my news yet. Gotta go. Pinky, wait! That boy doesn't have a clue. He can't be left to his own devices. I can't lose both of you. We need to wait for him to come back, okay? What if he doesn't come back? What am I going to tell Lena? Well, that was weird. She must be busy. Okay, girls, we'll teach Ines the choreo later. Let's go from the top. Awesome! Let's do this! Guys! Hmm... Interesting article, Miss Grisky? Oh, hello, Mr Castillo. I was just catching up on my... Japanese homework. I didn't realize we offered Japanese at the School. We don't. It's an online course. If it's an online course, why are you reading a Japanese newspaper in the middle of the Palais Garnier? Extra credit. Uh‐uh. Carry on then. Okay, again from the top! Oh, oops. Hold on... Wait, this is it! Guys, let's slow everything down. Maybe try to start in a circle. This is perfect. We've got it! I booked this studio for myself. Get out! Huh? What you got there? Back off! Confess! What? I saw you that night, so what's your plan? Learn hip‐hop? Master hip‐hop? Get a crew? Challenge other crews and take Max down? That's gonna take time, patience, determination and undoing everything you know about dance. So, we better get started. Look, I was never allowed to learn any of this kind of dance. I just wanted to see what the hype was about. Hmm... You mean this hype? You look ridiculous. No, my man, you do! And I can't unsee what you were doing back there. So it is my job... No, my duty... No, my obligation as hip‐hop master of the universe to get you started on the right path. But I warn you, you're gonna love it. You'll blink and you'll be wearing baggy pants and tie‐dye. Ha! Doubt it. Ouch! Come on, man. Let's start with your posture. You're too uptight, you got to shrug it off. Okay? Shrug it off, man! Shrug it off. What are you doing? Teaching you the basics. You got a problem with that? No... That's what I thought. Alright, ready? Shrug... it... off. Shrug... it... off. You... are... horrible. Forget it. No, no, no! I'm kidding! Come on, let's try again. Okay. Shrug... it... off. Pick it up, hey, hey, hey! There you go. Next lesson, ready? Catch me! Wow! There you go. Nice! Okay, girls, let's remember the rules. What is the first rule of the Blokettes? Never talk about the Blokettes. Excellent. And if anybody asks who is in the Blokettes, what do we tell them? All of us are in the Blokettes. What are the Blokettes? No, Bree. Because the Blokettes don't exist, remember? Excellent work, Kennedy. Oh girls, I just love this! Seven, eight... One, two... Is it wrong that I hope Thea never comes back? If it's wrong, then I don't want to be right. Where is Henri? It usually takes a bit of time. We just have to wait. Wait? We can't wait. What am I supposed to tell Lena? Nothing. She never has to know. I have to go to school. You call me as soon as Henri gets back, okay? Yeah, of course. I knew it was a mistake trusting you. Hey, how is this my fault? This is all just one giant mistake. Pinky, I have lost my best friend's boyfriend. I've really messed up, okay? Henri, learn how to use your phone, already! Oh, I missed you so much today! Where were you? Sorry, I just got consumed by this project and I... Oh, it doesn't matter! I have so much to tell you. Thea's totally wrecked everything in 1905. She's basically taken over what would be my life if I was back. She taught hip‐hop to everyone! And then she sent me this stupid newspaper article! Anyway, you're totally in the Blokettes, with me and Bree and Kennedy and these other girls I met at the community center! Uhm, it's just that the deadline for Dance Off was tonight, so we had to submit the audition. We're going to beat Thea at her own game. Oh, don't worry, I'm going to teach you every step. You'll be up to speed in no time. Check this out. Tah, tah, tah... Ha!
