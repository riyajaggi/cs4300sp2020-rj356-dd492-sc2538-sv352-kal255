 ♪ Figure out my life and still be me ♪ ♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up and welcome to my world ♪ (Lena) Previously... Lena and Max as planned. (Lena gasps) I'm so excited to be paired with Max for the mid-season show. (Thea) Lena ruins everything. This performance might be the biggest moment of my life. This has to be perfect. I agree. I miss Henri. It's working. We want the timepiece and the girl. But I still don't know where he is or what he's doing. "Dear Lena..." Jackpot. (Lena squeals with excitement) I can feel you staring.

 (giggles) I can't help it. I'm so excited for the show. The ants have occupied my pants. (Ines chuckles) Only you can take a well-known phrase and make it sound like it's from the 1900s. I've got a surprise. Okay. What is it? If I told you that would ruin the wow factor. Okay. I've sent you an invitation. See you there! (Jeff knocks at the window) What is all this? This is a formal breakfast. Woohoo! Don't mind if I do... Hmm. (Jeff humming) (makes eating noises) What? It's just that... it's not customary to shove food into your mouth before everyone's sitting. (with mouth full) Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Um... I'm good. I've put a napkin there for you. (Dash) Oh wow! Wow. Did you make all this yourself? Oh, it's no big thing. You get extra points for that. Well, some of us have manners. (Lena laughs) Surprise! (chuckles) This is my ritual before any big performance. And I needed something from home. Well, I mean I'll have to leave soon because I've got a ritual to do. But obviously after I've had this delicious breakfast. Oh look. Breakfast. What a treat. (Lena) I'm so glad you girls could make it. Please, help yourselves. (Thea) No, thank you. We're not hungry. This is so nice. The details. The napkins. Right. I'm not hungry. You're not? I'm famished. Oh look, Lena made beet and carrot smoothies. (Bree) Thea's favorite. How did she know? I bet she did research. I love research. It's so calming. Uh-huh. (Bree) Maybe she watches that cooking show. Last week was crazy. They blended... (sighs) I'm so nervous. I can't stop talking when I'm nervous. I think it's my genetics. (stomach rumbles) Did your stomach just rumble? No, that wasn't me. (Thea snaps her fingers) We should do this again. (Kennedy) It's like a big family breakfast. It's just so nice. This is the best smoothie I've ever tasted! (Kennedy) Give me some while she's not looking. (Kennedy) What is her secret? (Lena) Thanks for coming. I am so excited. I can't believe we're performing on the Garnier stage tonight. This breakfast is just something that we did back home on the morning of a big performance. And I'm really happy that I can share it with you all. (Jeff laughs, then whispers) Who's gonna tell her? You. Me? Oh, L. This spread is fantastic. Like... Amazing. Lovely. Really top-notch. But it's Saturday and the show isn't until Sunday night. (Lena) Oops! Well, enjoy it now because there is no way I'm doing all of this tomorrow. (all laugh) It is Sunday, right? I haven't blacked out or anything? My stomach is in knots. Shhh... What? Nothing. Lena! Lena! Great. Now I've lost count and I need to start again. Um... what's happening here? I'm packing, hello? Hi. Lena! Lena! I've got a system! This is my game day ritual. Okay? Hello, me. Today is the day we get to dance on the Garnier stage. (Lena) And that is the fourth time Ines has packed her bag. Are you sure you want to wear that? Well, if Henri can't be here, then yes. I'm going to wear it. For good luck. Even if it is against the rules. Okay, rebel. Let's roll. Today is a big day and I've got stuff to do, remember? I've got a system. Okay? Sir, yes, sir! (chuckles) What are you doing? What do you mean? No, I know when you answer a question with a question that means you're hiding something. Really mature. (giggles) What? Why are you doing this? I'm just warming up. It looks like a lot more than that to me. Oh, does it? It does. You've been in here for like two hours now. I woke up energized. It's part of my ritual. It's part of your ritual? And I've never heard of this ritual before because...? Because you don't pay attention. Oh, there we go! A snappy comment from Ms Raphael. And all is alright in the world. (Jeff) Oh, I feel weird. Does anyone else feel weird? I shouldn't have had eggs this morning. We all had eggs. It's not the eggs. This is totally random, but ankle socks might be the best invention. Ever. I must remember to take some home. She watched TV this morning. After spending two hours in the studio. Oh no, she did not! Is the world ending? Unclear. Be prepared for literally anything. Come on, girls. We don't want to be late for the big day. Let's do this! (Lena exhales) (ticking clock, magical tinkling noises) (Henri groans) Tie him to the chair. No! No! (groans) Henri? Now you're gonna watch us get through that portal, leaving you here. And you're never gonna get to see Lena again. (Henri) Please! No! (Frank) Nice work, Clive. Uh, Frank? Not now. I'm working on the plan. Okay, boys. Tonight we're gonna take the port-a-portal to the Garnier for a surprise visit. How many times do I have to tell you: you don't need to raise your hand? Probably a few more. I have a question. I know. I get the whole timepiece thing. I mean, that's all you can talk about. But who's the girl again? (Frank and Pinky) Lena! Ah, yeah. As I was saying, tonight's the night, as long as we can get this bad boy working. Let's test it. On it! Hey, not fair! I was the one who brought back that magical device from the future. I should be the one who gets to do the test run. Do you think you can handle it? I'm not an idiot. I'm going to jump through that portal and go get that princess girl all by myself. No, you're not. No? I'll tell you what, though. I'm going to put you in charge of Henri. That's a really important job. Yeah, hear that? (portal whirring) (electric noises) (Pinky) It works. You're a genius. Wow. (Jeff) Uh oh. Drama alert. Thea could explode at any second. Dude, it's all about being an understudy. You should know that. Uh... Oh, I feel sick again. It's gotta be those eggs. Not the eggs, Jeff. Hey, T. How's it going? Oh, I'm excellent, Jeffrey. Thanks for asking. (dresser) Okay, girls, costumes fitting's over. Get changed. ♪ I can feel my heart skipping Go off the beat ♪ ♪ Things are pacing too fast out on the streets ♪ ♪ And I try to stay on my feet along the way ♪ ♪ Another crazy day Okay, okay ♪ ♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up into a new world ♪ (Jeff retches) Oh, dude. I'm telling you, I think this is serious. ♪ Figure out my life and still be me ♪ ♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up and welcome to my world ♪ (Dash) You're the understudy, Jeff. Get over it. What does that have to do with anything? It's not the eggs. It's nerves. It happens to all of us. (Jeff) I don't get nervous. You know that. It means you care, Jeff. And that's okay. Come on, soak it all in. This is what it's all about. (Jeff) I still think it's the eggs. (all together) It's not the eggs! (all laugh) Frank... Wait for it. What if he's gone forever? Nobody asked you. Five, four, three, two, one... (portal starts whirring, electric noises) (Clive) Pinky! Good news and bad news, lads. The bad news? These hats are all the rage in 2038. The good news? The port-a-portal works. (classical music plays) Oh, come on. Get over it already! I don't know what you're talking about, Jeffrey. (copies Thea) "This is my role. He's my boyfriend and this is an outrage! I should alert the entire world!" Everything's fine, Jeffrey. Oh yeah. I forgot about your whole good luck ritual thing. Remind me, again? I do a hundred jumping jacks, a hundred push-ups, and a hundred sit-ups. And every single time, I deliver a sick performance. Dash, it's a whole thing. (laughs) Well, I'm gonna warm up with you. If you've never had a bad performance, this must work. Dash, this isn't a joke. Now I need to start again. Thanks a lot. (Thea) Break a leg tonight, Lena. I mean that sincerely. Thank you, Thea. You as well. Hey, you're quiet today. What's up? I'm just thinking about Henri. I wish he was here to see us perform tonight. Oh yeah, I guess Russia's a long way to go for a show, huh? I don't know why I can't stop thinking about him today. You miss your guy, L. That's cool. Hm, too bad he can't dance. Yeah, he's a total disaster. Yeah. And not cute. Like, at all. (announcer) One hour to curtain. Max looks okay, right? Like okay to go on? Not sick, from those eggs? He's fine. I don't wanna... No! Come on. (Lena laughs) (people chattering) (Bree) And she's wearing a different shade of lipstick. (Kennedy) So...? It's called "Red Scandal". (gasps) It is not. Uh oh. That's a bad sign. And it's super weird that she's not even here. Super weird. I just said that. Me too. It's not weird that Thea's not here, Lena. Just so you know. Yeah, thanks for the update, Einstein. There is no way Bree's related to Einstein. It's just an expression. Oh... Everybody looks lovely. Enjoy every moment of tonight. You've earned it. Go out there and make me proud. (bell rings) (Lena and Ines giggle) Just think, gents. In a few short hours, we are going to control time travel which means we will control time itself. Mwahaha... (portal whirs, electric noises) See you, Henri. Mwahaha... Clive really doesn't know how to tie a knot. Okay... What the boys did looked easy so I just set it to the bridge. We should be good to go. (classical music plays) (Ines exhales) What are you doing? What's this? You better get reading. Henri's here! Right now. Oh no. He's not at the Garnier. He wants to meet at the Alexandre III bridge at eight o'clock. Oh no. It's eight o'clock right now. Where did you get this? That's a lot of questions for someone who needs to be in two places at once. What are you going to do, Lena? How could you do this? You can meet your boyfriend or you can dance. If you want my opinion, that letter seems pretty urgent. But, it's up to you. (exhales nervously) Ten seconds. This isn't over. Lena, what's going on? Why is Thea dancing your part? Henri's here but he's not here. He wants to meet me at a bridge. Now. Wait. What? The Time Collectors are on their way and they're after me. There's another portal at the Alexandre III bridge and we're taking it tonight. But how did Thea.. I don't know. But I'm not going to be here to make her pay for ruining everything. Don't worry. I've got your back, okay? (whooshing sound, electric noises) We made it, lads. Okay, try to blend in, and let's get to work. Ooh! Great games. (girl) Ines' solo was so good! Clive! (girl) I know, but why is Thea dancing Lena's part? No, no, no, no! Pay atten... Pay attention. And stick to the plan. There have just been so many plans. Which one's this one again? Get the girl. Get the timepiece. Meet back at the portal. And by girl you mean... (Frank and Pinky) Lena! Lena! (Lena and Ines talking) (Frank) There she is. Go. Thank you for being the best friend a girl could ever ask for. (both laugh) You can do this. (Lena) Who's your best friend? A ballerina called Lena. Who's yours? A wild child named Ines. (Ines chuckles) Thank you for everything. (the audience applauds) (Lena) The Time Collectors. Distract them with this. This is what they want. I have to get Henri. Okay. Run! I've got this. (classical music plays) (Lena) Max... (the audience gasp) (the audience laugh) (the audience clamor) Looking for this? My whole life... There must be something wrong with my eyes, because I can't take them off of you. What is your name? Ines... but don't even... If beauty were time, you'd be eternity. Where's Lena? As if I'd tell you. I don't care how cute you are. (Frank) We've been spotted. We've got to go, now. I can't lose her, mate. She's the love of my life. Ha! I've never seen a prettier girl in my entire life. She's perfection. You see a pretty girl every thirty seconds. Not like her. She's different. Where's Clive? We've got to go. (Frank and Pinky) Clive! Oh, hey, gents. Look at this. You get points every time the big crane picks up the fruity bits. Aw... Come on, Ines. Where are you, Ines? Aha! Stop this. (reads as he texts) "Do you believe in love at first sight? Or should I walk by again?" Pinky? (phone beeps) "Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?" Eew. It's totally from that guy, Dirk. So we've got the timepiece, what about the girl, hm? (Clive) They're all over the place, Frank. Can you not see them? Oh no... Am I the only one who can see them? I cannot believe you two. How could you just lose her like that? I was busy meeting the love of my life. Too late, now, Pinky. Because They're after us. (Frank) We've got to go, now. Go. (Pinky whistles) Guys? I think it's closed. Do you, Clive? Yeah, it seems closed to me, Frank. Which one of you messed with the portal before we left? And by which one of you, I mean you, Clive. Why do I always get blamed? All I said to Henri before we left was "Don't worry mate, I didn't tie you too tight." Aaah! Oh... (laughs) Go! Go! Go! Guys, wait! Where is she? (Thea) I'm afraid Lena had a terrible case of stage fright, Ms Carré. She begged for me to go on for her. I can't explain what happened on the stage other than... the pressure must have got to her. Poor thing. Yeah... She feels horrible and is hiding in our room just now. Would it be okay if she spoke to you tomorrow? Fine. She better have an excellent explanation for this. I heard she had a meltdown and is on her way back to Russia. I heard she was abducted by aliens. (phone rings) Hello? (sobbing) Ines? I don't know what happened. Henri! Lena! Henri! (Lena sobbing) He was here one minute, and then... he was gone. I don't know what to do...
