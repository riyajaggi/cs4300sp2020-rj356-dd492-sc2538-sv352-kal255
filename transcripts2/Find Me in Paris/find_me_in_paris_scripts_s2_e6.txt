 My name is Lena Grisky and I go to the best ballet school in the world. I have a secret. I'm a time traveler from 1905 and my boyfriend Henri is doing everything he can to get me home. Previously... Armando is holding auditions for the Choreographers' Grand Prix. You get one shot at this, so pick wisely. And Ines and I are after the same role. I want to be the wild sister! Agent Lex is really shaking things up. First, she set a trap on the porta‐portal and then she deleted Clive. You will pay for this!

 Henri wanted to save Thea and jumped through the portal. O.M.G. But he didn't make it back. Can you please stop pacing, you're making me nervous. How did we let this happen? It's not like we could stop him. He was like, 'I'll go, I'll go get Thea. I'm a 1905 expert.' Okay, not helping, Pinky. Right. Stand back and cross your fingers. Ha! You did it! Have I ever told you how incredible and amazing and... Oh no, what's that? This device is in violation of 1963 infractions. It's last known user, Henri Duquet, has been remanded into the custody of the Time Bureau.

 Okay, I know that's bad, but what does it mean? Henri's in Time Jail! What? How could this happen? How are we going to get him back? What am I going to tell Lena? It's Lena. Okay, I need to answer. If I don't, she'll know something's up. - Okay, where are you? - You left so early this morning. Armando is making his selections for the Grand Prix today. Today? That wasn't meant to be for another three weeks! I know. But you know Armando. 'The best dancers are always ready.' Okay, yeah. I'll be there. Pinky, what are we gonna do? We need Frank. He knows about this stuff, but he's in 1905. Okay, I can work with that. I want you to go to the roof and put this in the brick at the Garnier. I'm going to school. Hey. Hey. I thought with this crazy‐town audition ambush, you'd be off doing a billion pirouettes. Hardly. Only weak dancers cram for selections. Hmmm.. I'm performing my finely honed audition day ritual. - Ping‐pong? - Wait. Is this bizarro world? Wait. Am I in an alternate universe? I put in the work, now I just need to stay out of my head. Hey. Up for some ping‐pong? I'm going full chill method. Oh, well, uhm... I mean we were... Uhm... I... He just asked me if I possibly... Yeah, no, never mind. I was going to play some video games anyway. That's way more relaxing. No, but... Max? Uhm... This is crazy. What is he thinking springing this on us? I know! It's so unfair. Yeah. He could have at least told you he was going to do surprise selections. I love surprises. Hey. Game face. Don't let him see you sweat. Hey, where were you? Are you okay? Lena, I'm sorry, I... You're vying for a spot in one of the most prestigious ballet events in the world. Act like it. Okay, everyone in position! Fan mail! You have one from Prince Augustus of Sweden again. And this is from that suitor who leaves notes for you on the roof. So romantic! 'Emergency. Roof. Now.' Desperate much. Let me see that one from Gus. Uh... I'll be right back! You with the fan, follow me. Okay, thank you, stop there! The dancers I tapped... are dismissed. The rest may continue for floorwork, so boys, in position, and girls, take ten. Thank you. Please, after you. I know you must be nervous and first impressions are everything. Thanks, but isn't that exactly why you should go first? No, honestly, I insist. No, I insist. Okay, I'll go first. Alright? Now, can we end this weird game of 'politeness chicken', yeah? Thank you. Hey, where were you? What's going on? I've got to go, I'll tell you everything so soon, okay? I did what you said. I put the letter inside and waited and it just flashed. 'What do you want? I'm kind of busy here!' 'It's Ines. Good to know 1905 hasn't changed you. We're in trouble. I need your help.' Why should I help you? 'I love it here. Just leave me alone.' 'Because Henri is in Time Jail. He'll tell the Bureau about Lena. And then, they'll work out that you're in a different time period, too. Go to this adress, it'll lead you to the Time Collectors' apartment. Frank will help.' Fine. Fetch me my shawl and get me my chaperone. - I've got nothing. - Nothing! I'm so sorry, Clive. I promise, I'm gonna get you back. I'm gonna find a way into The Bureau, and when I do, I'm going to rip them apart. Oh... You're Frank? Uh, yeah... Yeah, hi. You're Thea, right? From the ballet? Yeah. You're friends with that guy who does my laundry, right? Clive? Our friends at 2019 Future Street need our help. Really? It's quite the journey from Future Street. Did you by chance enlist the aid of a special clock? Indeed, I did. Princess Grisky lent me hers... more or less. - Lena's timepiece? - That's it! Uhm... Yeah. Uhm, yes yes, of course. Yeah, I'd be happy to help. I've got an idea, but we'll need to ditch the chaperone. I'm already one step ahead of you. Shall we all go for a stroll? I'll get my hat. Sharper, faster. Come on, punctuate the movement! No, no, no, you you you, you're out! Next line! Open up! Remember stage technique. Guys, open up. Okay, no, no, no! This whole line, you're out. Out! Next line. Better. Good. Better. I like it, keep that focus. I'm happy! Good. Okay, take 5. Uh, Lena! A word, please. Yes, Mr Castillo? I have to say, I'm impressed by what you're bringing to this process. You're becoming my top pick for Adelaide. Sir, I am very grateful. But I was really hoping to be Libertalia. Libertalia? The girl lashes out at the world like an injured beast. Yes, sir. I was hoping... Well, hope all you want, Lena. I'm sorry, I just don't see it. Right, I'd like to see you individually. Uhm, Clara, on first, please. I can lash out. I'm wild! I'm like a beast. Grrrr. Oh God. 'Ines, where are you?' What's happening? I don't know. Hey. Hey. I'm going for pizza, wanna come? Okay, dude, I don't know what your problem is, but pizza is my thing. Really? Cause I've been going for pizza during selections since my first round when I was eight. Guys. Guys. Everyone likes pizza. Yeah, but, dude, come on. I've got the best place. They do this truffle and rocket number on a perfectly crispy thin crust. My pizza place has a cauliflower crust. And it's killer. Okay, no. That is not pizza. I mean... Still sounds good, though. I'm in. Oh well, I mean, I'll still eat it! Just don't call it pizza! Ines? Are you up here? And you're sure Frank will help? Yeah, deep down he's a good guy. Ines, run! He's a Time Collector! Lena, wait. I know this looks bad... We have to go! Lena, stop! We're working together. What? Because, we lost Henri. You lost him? What do you mean you lost him? How? Henri and Pinky and I got the port‐a‐portal working again so we could get Thea back. And I wanted to tell you... Wait. You... You and Henri were working with the Time Collectors behind my back? Uhm... Collector. Singular. And it's not her fault. Henri jumped through the portal all by himself. How could you? Lena! Lena, wait. I'll go after her. Lena! Armando is seeing Libertalias now. Get in there! No, I can't. No. Thank you, Lenny, you can sit down. Miss Grisky. Alright. Show me what you think you've got. But remember, this is Libertalia, not Adelaide. Incredible! Just when I thought you couldn't surprise me again. It's incredible. Right, I have one dancer left to see. Ah, Ines, there you are. I'm sorry, sir. Can I have a moment, please? I still can't believe your chaperone believed you wanted to play hide‐and‐seek. You're going to be in a boatload of trouble when you get back. In case you hadn't noticed, I do things my way. Pinky, I don't know how to tell you this. Something's happened to Clive. It's bad. The Bureau's back. They got him. What do you mean "got him"? What happened? I trusted you to take care of him, Frank! I know. I'm sorry. There's this new Bureau agent, Lex. She and I got into it and the next thing I knew, Clive disappeared right in front of me. This is our chance to get him back! Victor used to be Bureau. Search his office. I'll look too from here in 1905. He should have coordinates to where Henri is. That's our way inside, and once we're in the Bureau, we get Clive. Okay, I'm on it. But Frank, this better work. Dude, that cauliflower crust was no joke. Hey, I know my pizza. It's not pizza. It's grated cauliflower with melted cheese on it. Just saying. Whatever. I'm going to catch you guys later. I'm going to run a few laps around the school. I have to stay lean if I'm going to play Damien. I'm going to be Damien. And I do ten laps of the school with jumping lunges. Enjoy your stroll! Lena, wait. We need to talk. No, we don't! Henri's in time jail. What? The Bureau put some kind of trap on the port‐a‐portal. He's been remanded into Bureau custody. What's time jail? I don't know. But Pinky and Frank know about the Bureau. They'll help us. They say all we need to do is get some of Victor's old files. They'll give us the codes we need to get to Henri. They should be in his office. But why would Victor have codes to time jail? I don't know. Let's find out. Okay. Let's go. Hey. I'm sorry about... Don't. The only reason I'm here is because Henri needs our help. I get it. But I promise I'll do everything I can. Frank's helping too from 1905. We'll fix this. This is incredible. Okay, so what are we looking for? The codes could be on anything. Uhm, paper files, digital, or this weird crystally thing if he went to the future. Something with a logo like that. So, is this the adventure? Because I have reading circle. Don't let me keep you from that cavalcade of excitement. I'm just unraveling the mysteries of time travel, but... By all means. What's your deal? Lena calls you a Time Collector and what's this "Bureau" everyone keeps going on about? All you need to know is that the Bureau are pure evil and they'll do anything, destroy anyone! Well, have fun at reading circle. Have you checked over here? I've checked everywhere. Maybe there were never any codes and Frank's deceiving you, too. Frank wouldn't do that. I'll go talk to him. Maybe he found something in 1905. A memory stick? In 1905? That's... weird. Yes! Yes! That's it! But computers don't exist for another hundred years, so how are we supposed to use it? That's where our friends from future street come in. Back in a flash. I found the codes! But they're on a USB stick. It doesn't seem to work in the chimney. I can't send it throug the brick like the letter. But there's a hiding spot in the big shelves in the office. I'll put it there. This is it, Pinky. We're getting Clive back. Whatever it takes, mate. Even if it means going against your girl, or mine. This is for the greater good. This is for Clive. Are you ready? You know, there's still time for reading circle. You would cause quite the scandal. That does sound thrilling, but I think I'll pass. Thea? Coming! Whatever it takes, mate. Even if it means going against your girl, or mine. This is for Clive. Frank found it! It's in here... I don't understand. It should be here! See? Never trust a Time Collector! Maybe he kept it for himself. Or maybe there were never any codes at all. Hang on. Frank hid it over a hundred years ago. It could have got moved or something. Let's keep looking. Armando's calling everyone back. The shortlist is ready. Go. I'll keep looking. If I find it, I'll come get you. I promise. Come on, we can come back later. We can't keep Armando waiting. Okay. It's been a long day, so I'll wrap it up now and continue with you boys tomorrow. No. No! Mr Castillo, I beg you. I will dance all night. Just please don't make me do this dance again! You won't be dancing at all, Mr Chase, if you're not off the floor in three, two... Good lad. Same time, same place? Where else would I be? Well, see you then. Just try and stop me. Why would I? You wouldn't. My shortlist for the two sisters is as follows. Charlotte, Sofia and Lenny. Clara... and Lena. O.M.G., Lena! You are the only Second Division dancer to make the list! You were amazing. Way better than Thea! Don't tell her I said that. Lena, that's amazing. Congratulations. Lena! I'm not ready to talk to you. But this is important. You were totally right! This is the letter Pinky and Frank were sending through the roof. Frank was never helping Henri. I told you we couldn't trust the Time Collectors! Henri is gone and now we have nothing! Lena, wait! Lena...
