 My name is Lena Grisky and I go to the best ballet school in the world. I have a secret. I'm a time traveler from 1905 and my boyfriend Henri is doing everything he can to get me home. - Previously... - Clara and Lena. I was shortlisted for Libertalia, the lead in the Grand Prix show. Congratulations. But Ines was benched. Back in 1905, Thea has been chosen by famous choreographer Menkin to be his Étoile. Your technique is extraordinary. See you in rehearsal? Lex's rookie mistakes are starting to leave some traces. Uh‐oh. You deleted Clive. And she's racing against time to cover her tracks.

 I know you wanted to be Libertalia. I know you'll get something good though. It's fine. You're the one on the shortlist. Let's focus on you. You have to beat Clara. Yeah, I don't care that she's First Division. I'm going to represent the Seconds, yo. I'm going to embrace my inner wild child. I'm going to be unpredictable. Reckless, even. A risk‐taker. I mean, how wild is Clara, anyway? Well, she bungee jumped sixteen times over the summer, jumped out of a plane twice and it says that on her last visit to the zoo, she brushed a tiger's incisors. I mean, I'm not sure if the last one's true, but that's kind of the least wild out of the three, so... Hmmm... Oh no, I don't stand a chance.

 Are you kidding me? Who cares about jumping out of planes? You have jumped through time. And it doesn't get any wilder than that. Really? Totally. You're right. Time jumper totally out‐wilds a tiger tooth brushing plane jumper. Watch out, Clara. I'm going to get crazy... Oh no! I am so sorry. Kennedy? But see, you get too close to this wild child and you just might get hurt. Can someone please get her an ice pack? It's the ones versus the twos, folks. Game faces are on and things are about to get super duper real, yo. But seriously, what an amazing opportunity, right? Right. You okay, man? I'm fine. Good. Game on, then. Game on. Isaac, we got you a towel with your name on it for good luck. Uh, thanks. Are you two even in this class? Well, that went well. I know. He actually spoke to me. Uh... I do not need to tell you what an important audition today is. We're down to the wire for casting the performers and today will have a huge impact on my decision. I'm going to get started straight away with Clara, Isaac, Max, Lena, Alex and Lenni. And one more thing... let's keep it quiet in here. Okay. Okay! You guys know what a huge deal this is, alright? So head up, posture tight, core, posture up. And let's crush this thing! Jeff! What's the definition of quiet? Oh... Well, uhm... the opposite of talking. Got it. Okay. I'm going to sit sssuper sssilently. Aaaah... Oh... This is an official invitation to Buckingham Palace. What? This is huge! I've been dying to meet Harry. What if Meghan and I become BFFs and I get to go to all the parties on the yachts and all the polo matches? Uhm, who and what in the world are you talking about? Oh... Right, yeah. Never mind. Bet the Queen would love me though! Let me see. Maybe there's a plus one. I've researched the Royal Family. I know everything. I could be quite an asset during that social outing. - These are from Menkin. - Menkin? He's saying I'm getting introduced. But to who? To whom. And it's only the most exciting thing ever. He's literally the most famous choreographer in the world and he's introducing you to the patrons and benefactors. And it's tonight. I need to get ready. Come on, chop chop. Let's make me a superstar! Good. And stop there. Interesting. I liked it. Alright, next pair. Isaac and Clara. Wait, that's not part of the choreo. What are they doing? I don't usually applaud a last‐minute change in choreography. But that was superb. Well done. Okay, next pair: Alex and Lenni, please. They've changed the choreo. They're really pulling out all the stops for these roles. Maybe Max should slide on his knees across the floor? Come on, Clive. Where are you? There's got to be a clue about the Bureau in here somewhere. How did you get in here? I'd start talking if I were you. Fine. I know you're Bureau and I need to find a way in to get Clive back, so... I figured your office was a good place to start. I'm not Bureau. You're lying. No, I'm ex‐Bureau. Well, you know what they say. Once Bureau, always Bureau. Did you ever consider that we might be on the same team? Oh, I doubt that. Suit yourself. But I can tell you one thing. If your friend Clive was deleted, he'll be much harder to find. It is not impossible, but he's in the powers of the Bureau. And you need me. You know you do. Fine. What were you thinking? We set a trap for Lex. And what's your end game? That is my business. But stopping the girl is something we could do together. Are you in? We need a plan. Something out of the box. Something bigger than what they just did. We need to outsmart them, out‐dance them. We basically need to out‐everything them. Yeah. Look, I have a crazy idea. Are you in? Definitely. I'm not going to get Libertalia by playing it safe. Okay. So first, we change the music. There's this piece that gets my dad super sentimental when he hears it. I used to put it on when I knew I was in trouble. It works every time. Okay. Music, check. Music, check. Next, we change the choreography. We do his lift, his signature lift. It's the one that made him famous at Empire. He won choreographer of the year for that. I've seen a video of that lift. It's spectacular! Shh. Yeah, it is spectacular. But he doesn't teach it anymore, because he thinks it's too dangerous. Practically no one can do it. But I think we can. We can? I mean, yes, we can. There's no room for doubts. It's what Libertalia would do. Exactly, we can do this. Embrace the wild Libertalia. Oh, I'm spooning the wild and I'm brandishing a toothbrush. What does that mean? Never mind. There's no time. Okay, I'll meet you in the studio to rehearse. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the prima and star Thea Grisky. I told you not to push me. You deleted Clive. Hey, in my defense, I didn't believe you when you said we could delete people. I didn't think it would actually work. Well, it did. - And I need you to bring him back, right now. - As if! I might not have planned it, but deleting Clive was the most fun I've had in a long time. Careful, Frank. You don't want to be next, now do you? Don't you even think about threatening me. Don't you know who I am? Yeah, you're the Time Collector who thinks he's the tough one. It's adorable, by the way. No, I'm your worst nightmare. I'll be ready. And I'll be everywhere. And when you least expect it, I'll take you down. What? That was a close call, Agent Dosne. I don't think you realize just how dangerous he is. Well, I've handcuffed him for now, but we've got to go. Wait, are you Bureau? Officer Duquet. Elite Division. Uh, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir. I... I'm so sorry about before. You're in over your head. Let's go. There are too many people around. We really don't have time to worry about Thea right now. You're right. We'll deal with her after the auditions. Oh, Henri! Uh, hi. Hey. Sorry I didn't call you back. Now's not really a good time. I need to rehearse before the auditions. I know. I'm here to support you. I just need a minute. Go ahead. I'll catch up with you. Okay. Don't be late. Yeah. You really are a hard girl to find, you know. I know. And I'm sorry, but it's crunch time and I have to be wild. I'm literally flying by the seat of my pants. You what? Anyway, I got you a gift. For good luck. Yeah, okay. I know last time I got you a gift for luck, this all happened. But uhm, I've tested it against the portal and... ...no unexpected time travel. Wow. Uhm... Thank you. Oh, I love it! Uh... I wanted to get you something modern this time. Do you really like it? Oh, I really do. Uh... But I'm sorry. I have to go. I have to be better than a bungee jumping plane driver. That sounds like an interesting ballet. It is. And thanks again. I'll see you later, okay? Yeah, I'll... see you later. We can definitely do this. Okay. Yeah, one hand. The hands like here, no? No, no, they were over the top. Okay, yeah. This way? Uh‐huh. Okay. Yeah, you take a few steps back. I'm actually supervising your mission. You do have a mission, don't you? It might not be my mission per se, but when the opportunity came, I grabbed it. There's nothing wrong with a little ambition, young lady. Even if this wasn't your mission to take on. I didn't mean to breach protocol. It's just that people are all over this time‐rip and I know I can fix it. Tell me everything and I'll do whatever I can to help you avoid suspension. I'm going to send everyone back to their rightful time period. Lena, Henri, Thea, the Time Collectors, everyone. That's quite ambitious. The work of a top elite agent. You really think so? I do. Thank you, sir. But you're not a top elite agent, now are you? No, sir. Shut it down. All of it. You know I'm right! I just need a little bit more time. This might not have started as my mission, but it's mine now. You're acting outside of the Bureau's orders. You're a danger to us and to the world. I'll keep this between us, but next time I won't be so nice about it. Do the work you were hired to do. Got it? What? Uhm... What exactly is that on your head? I'll have you know that Anna Pavlova wore one of these beauties for Ondine and she made history. So there. What? - That is not Anna Pavlova. - That's Thea. Get this headpiece off! It's bad luck! Get it off, get it off, get it off! Oh man, this is not good. She's changing history. She probably locked Anna Pavlova in a closet and stole her part. The more this goes on, the more change will happen. This is bad, Lena. What are we going to do? I don't know. But we have to get Thea back before things get totally out of control. Get it off! Get it off, off, off, off! Get it off, off, off! So? She bought every word. I'll make you the biggest star the ballet world has ever seen. I will not let you down. I was born for this. This is everything. You ready? Let's show him what we've got. Lena... Yeah? Nothing. She really does float across the stage. Clara doesn't stand a chance. Dude's killing it! Totally killing it. Lena is on top of her game. This is sick, Jeff. - Where have I seen this before? - It's Armando signature lift. Wow. - Amazing. - Incredible. Beautiful. - Oww! - Max! Don't move. Just stay completely still. Call the medics, please! Okay, it's alright. I'm right here, Max. - Something's wrong. - It's okay, I've got you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shh. It's okay, I'm sorry too. Medics, please! Can somebody get some ice? It's all right. Don't move it. - It hurts so bad. - Yeah, yeah. It's alright. Okay. Keep breathing. Victor Duquet. Unknown. AWOL. Traitor? I've been duped! Ride with him to the hospital. I've got it covered here. Call me the minute you hear anything. Lena, come with me? Are you okay? Are you hurt? No, I'm okay. But I can't leave him. He's my dance partner and he took the fall so I wouldn't get injured. I hope you understand. Yeah, of course. Uh, call me later. I will. I promise. Everyone, go back to the dorms. Okay, let's go, please. Come on, no time to waste. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Okay. Hey. How are you feeling? Dad, I'm sorry. I never should have attempted the lift. This is all my fault. I should never have agreed to it. Mr Castillo, I'm so sorry. Guys, come on. It doesn't matter now. All that matters is how you're feeling. So can I skate out of here now, or what? Someone say something, please. I'm sorry, Max. But the news isn't good. It's fine, come here. You'll be fine. I know it. Okay?
