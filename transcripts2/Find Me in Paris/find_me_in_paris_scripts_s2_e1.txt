 My name is Lena Grisky and I go to the best ballet school in the world. I have a secret. I'm a time traveler from 1905 and my boyfriend Henri is doing everything he can to get me home. Previously... You're leaving, aren't you? I had one last chance to dance on the Garnier stage before going back to 1905. And it was so amazing! Henri finally came for me, but it wasn't easy for him to get to me. Oh my god! The Time Collectors are constantly chasing us, and now the Time Bureau was after us, too.

 They're so powerful that one of their agents froze Victor, Oscar and my mother to keep them from coming after us. But when Henri and I got to the portal, it was already closed. Oh no... Now we're both stuck here and Thea is the one who ended up in 1905. Lena Grisky, you will pay for this! Lena? Lena, where are you going? Can we at least talk about this for like, one minute? Lena! You've already had a moment. I think Lena can talk for herself, thank you. It's Henri, isn't it? Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Come on, we really have to go. We need to figure out what's happening.

 Wait. What do you mean? What does he mean? I just need a minute, okay? Please. Seriously, what is going on? Who is that guy? And where are Thea and Dash? Wasn't she like, just here? Totally. Unless... What? What? Unless she has an evil twin! No... I'm so sorry. I should have told you I was leaving with Henri. It's just that... Yeah, but where... where are you going? It's too complicated. But... Lena, we really need to go. We might be in danger. I'm so sorry. I wish I could explain. Wait but... What does he mean, "in danger"? I'm sorry. Uh... I still don't understand why you guys were trying to go through a brick wall. So, uh... What is this place? Why am I in 1905? I feel like I'm standing in the middle of a history book! Oh, wouldn't that be fun? How can you make jokes? Where are all the cars? Why are there horses everywhere? This is freaking me out. I need to go home. Now! What are you looking at? You've just got a tiny bit of something on your face there. What? This is all the rage. You look like you're wearing curtains! I'll find you a jacket so you'll fit in. How did you know that would be there? My dad is surprisingly predictable. Let me see that. "Henri, if you are reading this, then something went horribly wrong. Where are the Time Collectors? Where is the Time Bureau? Did you see anyone else go through the portal? Because if anyone went through that portal that shouldn't have, it will lead the Bureau right to you." Duquet's office is over here. Let's go! He's hiding something, we just have to find it. It will lead us to his son and the ballerina. There's nothing here. Let's go. This is totally barbaric! Since when has there ever been a dress code? And if I can't get in there, how am I meant to get home? Seriously! What do we do? Do I get in one of those pumpkin thingies? Will that take me home? W... wait. No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes. I can't even! It seems you already did. Yikes. Fix this, now! You're mean. Good luck, all by your lonesome. Wait! Fine! Fine, fine. I'm sorry. Please help me. Please. Okay. Don't. Get me some fresh clothes. Now! Hmm... Oh, good morning, mam, I've got some files for you. Have yourself a good day! Argh, I get that I'm the rookie. And I'm willing to play their little game and be the perfect little assistant until they're ready to give me a mission of my own. But my boss is away, and if that means cutting a few corners and finding my own mission, then so be it. Yeah, I'm still here. I gotta call you back. Looks like we've got a time breach! Captain Michel's office, Agent Dosne. Get me the Captain! There's been a time breach in 1905. He's not in at the moment. But if you give me the address, I'll make sure he gets the message. 425 Rue Basque. Get an agent down there now! Yeah, got it. Thank you. Everybody freeze! You're all under arrest! But we're already frozen! Where's Lena? Where's Henri? Who are you? I'm Lex Dosne and I ask all the questions around here. I've been brought in to clean up this mess. You're Bureau. Yeah, that's right. And you've got some explaining to do. Oscar! Can you help us? I'll check the back room! Wait... What if we stayed? What? It's amazing here! You'd love it as much as I do. Just hear me out. If we go back, we'll be separated. I'll never dance or make company. We could have a life here. Together. But we don't belong here, Lena. Under the authority of the Bureau, you must surrender any timepieces that you've used for any unauthorized time travel. We don't have any. At least get your facts straight. We were left frozen by your colleague Francie Parks. Yeah well, she got fired. So now, you'll deal with me. She got fired! What's with him and why isn't this working? He must still be under the spell. Stop this! Oh... Oh no, I wasn't meant to do that. What's going on? What is this place? Who are you? Who are you? Whoa, that's a lot of clocks. Young lady, you have no idea what you've done. I was just following the orders. Stop right there, or I'll push the button again! What are you still doing here? Oh no, what have I done? Hmm... Where's Oscar? If he were here, he would agree that this is the worst idea ever. Who are you and what do you want? Who am I? Who are you? Oscar... Oscar? What on earth happened to you? Hmm... We found this letter in Victor's office. And then these three men came in and just took everything! And not only that, but Oscar is seventeen. What is this? It's a drawing of the portal we built. Lena tells me you're a genius. Maybe you can make sense of it? Uhm... I have to tell him something. Okay. Hi. Hey. Look, I want to tell you everything. It's just so complicated and kind of unbelievable. I just thought after everything we've been through, we were kind of past this thing. We are. It's just... Lena. I wish I'd never met you. Max, wait. Look, it's curfew. Then I bid you a good night. Yeah, okay... Okay, curfew is really serious stuff. You really have to go. Come on! So you can stay at Oscar's, yeah? Yes, he agreed to let me stay. Okay. So much has changed. Yeah, but at least we're together. Thank you for coming for me. You never gave up. I never did. You're a wonderful dancer, Dash. We're very lucky to have you here. What can I do to make you reconsider? I appreciate that, Ms Carré. But I realized that I spent the last few years trying to best Max instead of trying to best myself. But why didn't you come to me sooner with this? While I can't make guarantees, you certainly have an excellent chance of making company next year. Thank you. But I really feel like transferring to the London School of Ballet is the best choice for me. Very sorry to see you go, Dash, but I wish you the best of luck. Thank you. Why are you being so weird today? And why are you coming out of Gabrielle's office? Man... I was waiting to tell Ines before I told you, but I may as well tell you now. I'm... I'm leaving. Cool. I'll come with. What are you thinking? Yo. Pizza? Crepes? Oh, those little waffle thingies with the little thing on... Wait, why are you looking at me like that? I'm leaving the school, Jeff. And Paris. I got accepted into the London School of Ballet. But you just... But... Nope. Sorry, that's a... Bro, come on. You're not leaving the school! I won't allow it. Bro, come on. They offered me a spot in the company next year, guaranteed. Wait, what? Dude, you can't go. I can't believe you decided this without even talking to us, man. Jeff... Dude. Everyone's already leaving for summer vacation. Please stay for the summer workshop. Please, please, please. Sorry, Lena, I can't. I've got to exercise my mind. Plus, science camp is a ton of fun, but if you tell anyone that, I will totally unfriend you. Shhh! Sorry. Anyway, you'll be busy with Henri, getting him up to date with the modern world. I'm trying. Lena... Ah, seems like just yesterday that a young time‐traveling princess slammed right into the very same door. He'll adjust. Just like you did. I should go rescue him. Sorry. Surprise! Oh, Henri. I only have a few minutes. We have pairs next. Okay. Oh hey! There you are! You are just in time, because I'm ready to kick your butt in "Desert Destroyer. This time it's personal". Come on, I'll race you. What's wrong? Come on. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do so... I'm just gonna do it, okay? I got into the London School of Ballet. I've been guaranteed a spot in company next year. It's the right choice for me. The only reason why I'm hesitating is... is because of you. You, Ines, have been the best part about the last few years of my life. And if you don't want me to go, I won't. You have to go. Thanks a lot! I look like a footman! You're welcome! Ooh! Now that I'm stuck here, I may as well try to fit in. Wait, are these company dancers? I am so much better than them! Oh my god, I've mastered steps that haven't even been invented yet. I can dance circles around these amateurs! Circle dancing is the best. Take this to Sir Cafour's carriage. You're leaving? Just for the summer. Bags. Carriage. Now. "Bags. Carriage. Now." It's always Clive. Always Clive... This one's not even a bag! Lena? This must be just before she disappeared. It's funny. It's a joke. Is it? I don't get it. What's a me? Meme. Totally radical word. You've been practicing your slang? Yes, why, was it wrong? A little bit. I have to get to class. Meet you later, okay? OK. Sure. Later skater. What's the matter? What's going on? Dash is leaving. What? He's going to London. For good. Oh... There's a lot of love needed today. It's going to be okay. I saw her go through that backstage door with that usher guy but that was ages ago. That was the last time I saw her too! That usher guy was so cute. Yeah, totes cute. Wait, but she would have updated her socials and there's no mention of a door. Or a cute guy. We're way off track! Thea went through the portal! Oh no! I threw the timepiece! Thea must have found it! Hello? I'll be attending the school, effective immediately. And you are? I'm Princess Grisky. The other one. The one you didn't lose. Of course. We didn't know you were coming. Our apologies. And what is your first name, Princess Grisky? It's... Olga Svetlana Annastasia Grisky. But you can call me Thea for short. I am a far more superior dancer than my cousin Lena. Welcome. You can join the summer classes, if you'd like. I'll be in the back. Sure, knock yourself out. What? Portals in a different time period? No way! Timepieces! For real? This place is totally bonkers! Time travel is totally a thing, you know. Trust me, I know. Okay. "Dear Thea. Are you there? Are you okay? Are you in 1905? Whatever you do, hide the timepiece! There's really nothing we can do until the portals open, and we don't know when that might be, so you'll just have to do what I did and fit in. I'm not going to lie. If you're in 1905, it's going to be really hard, especially for you." Especially for me? What's that supposed to mean? Whatever, Lena. I don't need your help. I can do this on my own. How hard can it be? What? If Thea's in 1905, she'll never survive! And I mean that sincerely. Ah! No phone, no internet, no status updates! She hasn't read it yet. No shower! No followers! Okay, so what now? Well, we can't force the portals to open. That's probably not for a few months. Why don't we hack into Thea's socials and pretend to be her. Oh. Good idea. She's on that tour all summer so that buys us some time. But we'll have to email Ms Carré and her mother, so they don't get suspicious. Right. We just need to figure out how to get to 1905 and bring her back. Yeah. Easy! I can't believe she's gone. I can't believe Dash is gone. I know it's best for him and everything but I just... I know. But you have me, you do know that, right? I need to tell you something. Ines, I want to stay. I want you to, too. No, I mean forever. I feel like I belong here.
