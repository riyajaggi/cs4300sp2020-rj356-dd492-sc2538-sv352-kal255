 ♪ Figure out my life and still be me ♪ ♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up and welcome to my world ♪ (Lena) Previously... (Ines) Lena's in so much trouble with Ms Carré for running out in the middle of the showcase. (Ms Carré) You may stay, but you'll never make Company. (Ines) The Time Collectors still have her timepiece. This timepiece can create a time loop. Ouch. Clive! There's another piece somewhere. (Ines) I wonder if I'll ever see Pinky again. Be right there, boss. (Ines) What? He was cute. If beauty were time you'd be eternity! Has anyone seen Lena? (Lena) She's not here. Oh. Okay.

 Lena... Come on, what happened to proving Carré wrong? What about the big speech you made? What if she's right? What if I'm not good enough? Well, she will be if you just lie here feeling sorry for yourself all day. We've got a history test to crush and a full day of dances with Carré. Lena, come on! Lena! I'll pass. Okay. I'll tell Carré you'll be dancing from your bed then, yeah? (laughs) Lena. Come on. The only way to change her mind is to actually change her mind. Oh! You know what? You're right. Thanks, Ines! (Ines chuckles) Today, you'll put together a short piece, drawing inspiration from a different time period. This is so perfect. This is my chance to change her mind. (Ms Carré) Blending two time periods, two styles will make for some interesting dances. You have until end of day. First group: Dash and Max, Thea, Ines and Jeff. Second group: Tim, Laura, Sana, Mike and Jonas. Ms Carré? Which group shall I join? Neither. You won't be participating. You're free to work by yourself in another studio. Yes, Ms Carré. (other students whispering) (magical tinkling and suspenseful music) I can't believe you went to the Time Collectors. Of all the stupid things... But, just for the record, I did come to you first. Do you not remember the whole threat to send me to Uncle Alain's farm? Which I should have done. But let me assure you, you are finished hurling yourself through time. Is that clear? (bombastic classical music plays) (panting, out of breath) (Henri) So my Dad's really mad, and now he won't tell me anything else. I just wish we could talk. (magical tinkling noise) ♪ Cause time passes so slowly ♪ (gasps) ♪ With your arms around my body ♪ (Lena) Henri! I'm here. Are you here? I mean there... but here. You know what I mean. Oh, I wish we could talk too. I have so much to tell you. (magical tinkling noise) (gasps) Whoa. She's here now! (gasps in disbelief) We've never been on the roof at the same time before. The letter appeared right away! Are you there right now? (magical tinkling noise) (magical tinkling noise) (gasps) (Lena) Henri! I am here right now! This is totally wicked. 'Wicked'? Is there evil? And why all these happy faces? Is it a code? (Lena laughs) Not that kind of wicked, silly. Good wicked. The happy faces mean I miss you like crazy. (Henri) I'll find a way back to you. I promise. I hope so. I got in so much trouble the other night for leaving. I almost got expelled from school. Thankfully, they're letting me stay, but Ms Carré said... she said that I'll never make Company. (Clive) Oh. Where's Pinky? I... I think it's pretty obvious he's not here, Frank. Thank you, Clive. My eyeballs actually stopped working for a minute. So I'm really glad you could fill in that blank for me. No problem, boss. I'd have that eye thing checked out though. Don't talk. For the rest of the day. Just sshh. Okay... (walks down the stairs) That seems a bit harsh. Hello, beautiful. Care for a walk? Or better yet, care for a bite? (sighs) You have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. (sighs dreamily) (video game sounds) (incoming text message) Oh, gross. What? (incoming text message) In your dreams... As if I'd ever go on a date with him! A date? A date with who? Dirk. Dirk? He's sending you texts? (scoffs) I don't think so. I really miss you. I wish you could see all this. I wish you were home. I can almost feel you. Like you were right here. (giggles) We're like Romeo and Juliet. Remember when we used to dress up in those old costumes? Remember when we used to dress up in those old costumes? You've just given me the best idea! I have to take care of something, but I'll be back! And thank you! (magical tinkling noise) (students chattering) Oh, hey, Dirk. What do you think you're doing? What? Oh, don't play dumb with me. Go. Don't... text... Ines. Don't text her, don't think about her and don't ask her on a date. Got it? (exclaims) What are you doing here? You can't be here! It's like magic. Because... I am. Well, you can't be. And yet I am. Do you have a bandage? A what? Because I just scraped my knee falling for you. Oh no. No, no, no, no. So you've been getting my texts? That was you! That makes more sense. It's a loaner. What do you want? A date. No way. Way. Not a chance. I'm going to be late for class. So I'll meet you after school. I'm going to class. Great. Super. So I'll see you after school? (laughs) (door opens, footsteps approach) How did you get in here? What do you want? The other timepiece. (hesitant) Right, Frank? Well, I was hoping to be cooler about it... but yeah. So, hand it over. What other timepiece? Good question, Victor. I'll tell you what. What? Not you. Him. Hm-hm. I'll tell you what... What? Clive. Hm-hm. Stop turning my threats into comedy routines, please? You got it, boss. Thank you. I know you have the other timepiece. So you can do like any sane person would and hand it over. Or you can await the consequences. I'm just giving you the opportunity not to have to find out what I will do next, Victor. Ooh... Whoa. I'd take that if I were you. You boys have no idea who you are playing with. Don't test me. No, come on! We've done that a thousand times. Can we please try something different? It is different. You're just not seeing my vision. So, Dirk won't be bothering you again. Dash What did you do? It's cool. (Jeff makes whooshing noises) Jeff, back me up. We need to pick a time period. The fifties are awesome. They're totally innovative. Oh yeah, and you know that because...? (sighs) Guys, come on, we haven't even agreed on a concept yet. I'm going to refuel. (Lena) Guys! I have an idea. And I think it's a good one. It's the kind that gets you all tingly. Oh, please. I need tingles. Because all we have right now is "Sir I'm Always Right" and "Miss No I Am." (all chuckle) (Lena) Okay. We're a team and teams stick together. When we run the field, we have to be proud and strong. Everyone put a hand in. Uh... did you get that from TV? I did. It was a very exciting speech. The boy went on to catch an American football and everyone lifted him up and carried him. Who's in? I don't want to point out the obvious, but didn't Ms Carré ban you from this assignment? Well, I feel like it's an opportunity to gain some ground with her. It's the tingly thing. I have to follow it. I'm in. I love that movie. (laughs) (laughs) I'm in, too. Out. You guys go ahead. Me and Thea are going to do our own thing. Undecided. I promise you, it's going to be outlandish. Really? (Ines chuckles) No... wrong word. Out of this world? (all laugh) (Jeff) Better. Ah! There he is! Team Lena. (Ines) Team Lena! Team Lena! (Jeff cheers) (laughs) (giggles) Milady, may I request a dance? My dance card is filled I'm afraid. Curious. May I see it? (laughs) (coughs) It looks rather empty now. (Lena laughs) I'm afraid if I bow any lower, I might split my trousers. You'd be the talk of the town. (laughs) (classical music plays) (both laugh) (Lena squeals) (Henri laughs) (Lena gasps) (reads) "I was hoping you'd find these... Thought they could help with your project. I believe in you! Love, Henri." (gasps) You're the best, Henri! I knew you'd meet me. Can I ask you a question? Are you a camera? No... not again. Because every time I see you, I can't help but smile. Don't try to distract me with your clever wit. You've got something that belongs to Lena. Now give it to me. And stop smiling. You're dodgy. You're adorable. Your descriptive words and well-rehearsed one-liners don't move me. At all. Reeaally? Cause you're smiling ear-to-ear. Give me the timepiece. (sighs) Aah. Just kidding. I don't have it. It's back in 1905 with the boss. Now come on... Let me take you on one date. And I promise you won't regret it... Okay... If you give me the timepiece and promise to leave my best friend alone, then I'll consider it. I knew it! You're as crazy about me as I am about you. This feels like destiny, doesn't it? Chill. I said I'd consider it. I can't make you any promises other than I promise to worship the ground you walk on until the end of time! Whoa. Why are you so smiley? Oh, is it because of Dash? Nothing. And no. What's in the bag? You'll see. There's something you're not telling me. (nervously) Nothing to tell. Zero things. Absolutely nothing, honestly. (Frank) I will ransack this entire place until I find what I'm looking for. You will do nothing of the sort. Now get out of here. Okay. I'm warning you. What do you think someone like you can do to someone like me? Out. (tinkling noise) (Frank) I warned him. Why does he keep doing the same thing over and over? He's in a time loop, Clive. Ah! Why is he disappearing? When you're stuck in a time loop, you live the same moment over and over again, and eventually you disappear. Just imagine what we can do with both the timepieces. (Clive) He's going to get so sick of apples. My apologies, Mr Victor, sir. It's too bad you weren't eating something fun like a chocolate mousse or an éclair! Come on... We need to find that other timepiece. (Clive) Ooooh. Well, hello, handsome. Oh! Frank? (Frank) Yeees? I found a broom. What? A broom. (Frank chuckles) (medieval music plays) Weren't you supposed to be working on technique today, Lena? Alone? Yes, Ms Carré. Then please sit down. And don't ever disobey my orders again. I wanted to show you that I do have what it takes. That I have drive, and ideas, and passion. And costumes. And costumes! I never asked for costumes. Well, I thought it would give it that extra touch. My office. Now. (Max) Pssst. That was something, chica. I don't know what's gonna happen, but it was something. (Clive laughs) (rustling paper) There's got to be something. Hey! Victor Duquet is a man of many secrets. That means keep looking until you find something. (Clive sighs) More letters. Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. Ooh! This one's about some stupid jewelry. Who cares about a stupid necklace anyway? "We will not see each other again. I will protect my half of the stone with my life as I'm sure you will yours... and the two halves will never be whole again. Alex." Clive! Hm? This is about the timepiece! Oh. Isn't that what we're looking for? Yes, Clive! Obviously. So, I guess I saved the day then, didn't I? By tossing the letter away? Yeah, Clive, you are the single greatest hero I've ever met in my living life. Thank you, boss. Now all we have to figure out is who this Alex guy is... What was that? I know I wasn't supposed to do the assignment but I was just so inspired, I had to. It was wrong but do you ever feel that if you don't dance what you're feeling, you'll explode? I'm not one for explosions, but I do understand, yes. I didn't mean to go against you, but I wanted you to see just how much this means to me. And that I do have what it takes, Ms Carré. Even if you can't see that. It was beautiful. Inspired, in fact. Oh... Thank you. You didn't like being told you weren't good enough, did you? No, Ma'am. Or being left out of the assignment. (softly) No. Well, good. My plan worked. This was a test...? Make no mistakes, Miss Grisky. If ever you defy me again, you'll be expelled. Yes, Ms Carré. I mean, no, Ms Carré. I mean, you know what I mean, Ms Carré. I do. You're dismissed. (Lena giggles) (Lena) Henri, it worked. Thank you! Today was a good day. Today was an excellent day. I'll tell you all about it but first meet me on the peak. Now turn around, pretend I'm right there beside you. Milady, may I have this dance? Yes. It would be my pleasure, sir.
