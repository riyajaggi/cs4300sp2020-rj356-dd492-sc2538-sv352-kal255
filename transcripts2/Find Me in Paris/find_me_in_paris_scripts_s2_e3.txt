 My name is Lena Grisky and I go to the best ballet school in the world. I have a secret. I'm a time traveler from 1905 and my boyfriend Henri is doing everything he can to get me home. Previously... Dash has left and a new guy named Isaac replaced him. He's the real deal! You're in my spot. Armando's teaching at the school full time now. Looks like we're stuck with each other. Which isn't great, since he knows all about the BLOK. You have to make a choice. Is it ballet or is it hip‐hop? You can't have both. Max is still mad at me for not telling him the truth about Henri.

 We finally heard back from Thea. She's going to school back in 1905. Welcome. Where she'll be with my nemesis, Claudine Renault. And we still have no clue where the Time Collectors ended up. This is a brilliant idea. We just have to make sure her mother and everyone believe that she's still on tour instead of 1905. Lena, I hardly have any pics with Thea. It's not like we run around taking selfies all day together, is it? It's hard to know how to talk like her, like she would talk to her mother. She's a lot different with her mother than she is with us. True. Okay. How's this?

 "Dear, Mother." "The tour has been excellent so far. There's been an extension in several European cities, then I'll be heading back to school. All with Ms Carré's blessing, of course. Fondly, T." Fondly? You have met her mother, right? Good point. Okay, according to my chart, we're due to post something on her socials this afternoon. I don't know how long we can keep this up. We really need to figure out a way to get Thea back. Well, I've been doing some detective work and I'm thinking we're gonna have to build something to bring her back. What? You can do that? Right now it's just a bunch of wires, but if I get the frequency right then I could be onto something. She's lucky you're so brilliant. Well, we can't cover for her forever, so I've been running some numbers on the quantum flagpole. I don't even want to think of the mayhem Thea's going to cause while she's there. Yeah. We need to stop her before she gets totally out of control, 1905‐style. Tiddle‐di‐dee. "We're only trying to help, Thea. I know how lonely it can get." "Oh please, I've already made tons of friends. I really don't need your advice. Oh, and FYI, I've started at the Paris Opera Ballet School, circa 1905." That's good, right? Yeah, that's what you did. Tell her it's good and that she should keep trying to fit in. Okay. You're right. "That's great! Do everything you can to fit in. Don't gossip, or show emotion, and be polite. No offense, but don't be yourself." Uh! "Oh don't worry, Lena..." "I'm sure Claudine Renault can help me." "Do not under any circumstances take any advice or befriend that two‐faced lying snake Claudine. She'll destroy you, trust me. She's the one who started this mess by writing to my mother!" Come on, Lena, we have to work with her. Fine! "There's a reading circle. You'll meet plenty of nice girls there, way nicer than Claudine. She'll be there, but it's a good way for you to meet some other people." "Wow, a reading circle. You really were wild back in the day." "I'm just trying to help." Fine. Reading circle. How hard can that be? What's up? I mean, may I join you, Miladies? What's the book called? The Governess' Son by Charmaine Brulette. It's quite sophisticated. I'm sure you've never heard of it. Never heard of it? I got an A‐plus on my paper for this pile of garbage. Yawn. Lame. Ladies, let's talk about the theme. I have a better idea. Let's talk about that stupid ending. The Governess steals the golden watch away from the Prince in order to pay for her son's operation, but instead of making it for something life‐threatening it's for his tonsils. Like, who cares? Why not making it for something super juicy like a liver transplant or something? You are incorrigible! Okay, drama much? It's not like I insulted your outfits! Although... Oh, relax. I was just leaving. If we're going to coexist here, there have to be rules. Fine. Two dinners a week. Okay. And I'm continuing with the BLOK. Absolutely not. This is Second Division. No more hip‐hop. I've already told Lena. I'm not messing about with this. Or I can tell Ms Carré about your antics from last year and let her decide if a retroactive punishment is in order. Got it. No BLOK. I'm dead serious about this. It's done. Consider this our first dinner. I will not. Snacks don't count. Yes, sir. No, Henri, you hold it up to your face, not your ear. Hello? Lena, can you hear me? No, not like that! Is anyone in there? Okay, forget it. Meet me for lunch! Hello? Drop your hankies, girls, now pick them up, that's it. Good. This is called the stop and drop. Stop and drop, Miss Grisky. Not a chance, Miss Renault. Boo. I am going to report you to the Directrice. Oh no, my book walking and hanky dropping skills aren't quite up to code? You are rude and unmannered. I kindly ask you to leave. From the top, ladies. And posture and eyes down. This is unbelievable. Look around, girls. What are manners exactly? A way for you to all look exactly the same? Don't you want to stand out? Don't you want to be able to think for yourselves? You're wasting your time, I can tell you that for free! Grisky, out! What is happening right now? Hey, Lena! No... Oh, Henri. Stop it guys, he's new here. Okay, okay, okay. What is all this? I just wanted to impress you. But I've failed again. Don't worry. When I first got here, I slammed right into that door! I just don't know how to act here. Or what to say to you and your friends. I'm totally lost. You'll get used to it, don't worry. We need to go home. Can't you just give it a chance? What do you think I'm doing? I'm done with chances. We need to go back to 190... Shhh! This was a mistake. I need to go. Whoa... Whoa! Yeah, dude's totally retro. Ow, aw. I like him though. Ooouhw! I feel just awful. I mean, am I a terrible person for being embarrassed by Henri's mistakes? Hello? I know you're in genius mode, but I need your brain, please. I'm in crisis over here. I thought that with my experience of having to adjust I'd be able to help Henri but we're just clashing. There's no connection. It's awful. Sorry. Look, he'll come around. He just needs to adjust. But that's just it, he doesn't want to adjust. He wants to leave. Thank you! A rooftop picnic! Oh, Henri's so romantic. Maybe everything's going to be okay after all. "BLOK, Warehouse. Nine, tonight." BLOK audition! I'm surprised Max is even asking me to audition. We're not exactly on the greatest terms. Dudes are weird. No point trying to understand them. You're a wicked dancer, so why wouldn't he want you? Plus, he has to forgive you one day. Yeah, you're right, I guess. Thanks. And, oh! If I time it right, I can go on my date with Henri and then hit the BLOK audition right after. It's perfect! What are we gonna wear? Did you see those bizarre hand gestures? "And I'll tell you that for free!" Are you serious? Whoever invented these dresses, clearly never had to wear one! Whatever! This entire time period should be erased! I can't do this barbaric time period for another second! Nobody likes me. Like nobody. Henri! This is so awesome and romantic! Oh, and look at those little ballerinas! Oh no, what's wrong? What in the world are you wearing? Henri, we're not in 1905 anymore! Clearly not. Oh look, Thea's texting me, 1905‐style. She's struggling. You know how it is. Okay. I'm all yours! Okay. So I found a guitar in the back of Oscar's shop. Uh‐huh? A guitar. That's great. And it turns out, I actually really have a knack for it. Is everything okay with her? Uh, yep. It's all under control. Where were we? I don't know. I think we're pretty lost right now. - Uh... - Oh, Henri, I'm sorry. "Thea. I'm busy, you'll have to deal with it yourself." Ha! She's super high maints. Listen, I know things have been hard. But you have my undivided attention. I can't wait till we're back on this same roof in 1905. Sorry, sorry. Pretend I'm not here. I just need to get a few measurements. I've got an amazing idea to help Thea. Sure. Go ahead then. Anyone else? Hey! Maybe we should send word to the street that we are trying to have a romantic moment? Wow. Have you seen this? Never mind. You know what? Sorry. I can do this later. Sorry, guys. Henri, what is your deal? You're acting like a totally different person! Where's the Lena I know and love? I'm right here, but I have a life of my own, okay? There's a lot going on. Pinky? What are you doing here? Hi, beautiful. How was space camp? It was science camp. Don't worry. This is neutral ground. I'm stuck here until the next portal opening in a few months. I have no superpowers. And I totally haven't been hanging around all summer waiting for you to get back. How did you even get here? Jumped back through the portal before it closed. Okay, maybe I was waiting around all summer for you to get back. I want to see the portal you built last year. Absolutely. Anything to see you again, gorgeous. I can't believe I spent nine hours watching picnic vlogs for this! I don't even know what a vlog is! No, Henri, wait. Keep the table cloth to cover your shoulders. Fine, go!
