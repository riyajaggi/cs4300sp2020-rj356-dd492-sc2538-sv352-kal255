 ♪ It's time to show myself what I can be ♪ ♪ Figure out my life and still be me ♪ ♪ Wake up, wake up, wake up and welcome to my world ♪ (Lena) Previously... (Lena) You just want me to fail... -No, I don't. Thea wants me to fail. You'll never keep up. I'm already ahead of you. But I won't let her get to me. Henri's father Victor won't help him. -Stay out of trouble. And the Time Collectors are still after him. I'm going to erase you. Luckily, he's managed to escape them. Let's get him! -For now... (Jeff) Oh, man! You're the star of the scene study. As usual... -Thanks.

 I can totally see you as the "handsome farmer". Oh, me, you ask? Oh well, see, I've locked down the role of a tree, so... Actually, I should really cross that out and write "handsome"... (Kennedy) Uh-oh. Thea is the wife! She's not going to be happy. Who? Kennedy. -Bree. I'm the Downtrodden Wife? Seriously? (whispers) Are we supposed to answer? Who's the Etherial Sprite, then? Lena?! You have got to be kidding me! The Downtrodden Wife is a way better part. Just don't even. It is. It's such a stretch for you. The Etherial Sprite is... ...what you radiate on a daily basis. (squeals) I'm the Sprite! I'm the best dancer. I should be the Sprite. They're both great parts. Think about it. We could be trees... (Dash) Hm? -No offence. Is she being serious? Are you being serious? As if I'd ever get stuck on the back row as a tree. Please. (snaps her fingers) Congratulations. Question of the day. How does a tree actually dance? Like this...? (all laugh) It's a sunny day in grand Paris, and you know who likes the sun? Our handsome farmer, Max here. (sighs) Thea Raphael, you've landed the coveted role of the Downtrodden Wife. Please, tell us how you prepare for such a role. -Get lost, Jeffrey. (Dash laughs) -(Jeff) Oh, oh look. It's Sir Birch. Hm.... -I should have been the Handsome Farmer. You know it, I know it, even Max knows it. (scoffs) You're cute, Dash, but you're no "Handsome Farmer". (Dash) Yeah? But I'm the better dancer. (chuckles) Jury's still out on that one, bro. (Jeff) Ines, how do you think the Downtrodden Wife is going to react when the Etherial Sprite steals him away? Well, it's not going to be good, Jeff. That's all I've got to say. (Etienne clears his throat) Gather round, everyone, for some exciting news. As you read from the cast list outside, today we will be doing a scene study on one of the most romantic ballets in the history of ballet. The one and only... "La Fée" also known as "The Fairy". Oh, I love "La Fée"! You know "La Fée"?! Oh, it's one of my favorites. It's the story of a simple farmer, named Hubert, and his plain but loving wife, Griselle, and the Fairy who ruins them. (Jeff chuckles) -(Dash) Shhh! (Etienne) What a surprise. Mr Chase has an opinion. (students chuckle) (Jeff) Oh, well... A Fairy? How much damage could she possibly do? Oh, a lot! The fairy and Hubert fall madly in love and conspire to run away to the only place they can be together... Fairyland. (Jeff bursts out in laughter) Fairyland? Seriously? Bite your tongue, young man. Fairyland is the only place they can be together. (Jeff) OK... (Etienne) Enough chit-chat. Lena, let's see your sprite steal Max's farmer away from Thea's hag of a wife. (Lena) I was so distracted by Thea this morning, I didn't realize that Max is the farmer. So? It's just... there's this legend about "La Fée". Those that dance the roles, they always fall for each other. (scoffs) As if, Lena! (chuckles) (horse hooves clattering) (Oscar) No, no! I've already told you I don't want you in here. You're too much trouble. But we're friends. And friends wouldn't kick friends out when they have nowhere else to go. So you're in a bit of a pickle then, aren't you? -A little bit. My Dad said he wants to send me to my uncle's farm in the middle of nowhere but if that happens then I'll never get to Lena, who's trapped in a time bubble. You have to help me. I love her. Love will make you do the craziest things. This is amazing. There's stuff in here that isn't even in your book. You only skimmed my book. But look, maybe if I put it here or... Even here... That looks like something, right? Maybe a clue, or a code? OK. You win. Let me have it. Whoa... I keep a small room for travelers in transit. Keep it clean. You won't regret this. (classical piano music plays) (Etienne) Good. That's it, Thea. (Thea) (sarcastic) Great. I'm a natural hag. (Jeff whispers) I've never been so inspired by a human tree. (whispers) He's getting so into it! Are you okay? -I'm fine. Should we go from the top? -Yes. (whispers) Look at me. (Etienne) Extend, Lena. Max, give her more support. Don't lose the technique. Wooooh! (Jeff) This is feeling tense. Are you tense? I feel tense. I'm gonna give my tree a manly name. Redwood? Maple? How about a palm tree? (Etienne) Now, Max, this is the moment you fall head over heels in love with this etherial creature. I think he just did! (Ines giggles) (Etienne) Once again, please. (Lena sighs) (Etienne) Lena. You're killing me. I thought you respected Le Fée. I'm sorry, I do... -(Etienne) No excuses. Take five. Come back and make sure you get yourself sorted. What are you doing? Are you OK? Five. Minute. Break. (Jeff) Whoa. We've got a runaway fairy. (Dash) And a tree! I made such a fool of myself. It wasn't that bad. I don't get it. I wanted to get angry with him when he took my hand but... I felt so... I mean, his eyes are really... So this is about his eyes, now? He's so direct. All stare-y like that. Oh no. Clearly it's the legend and we've both fallen under its spell. Have you considered the possibility that you might just like each other? (gasps) No! Of course that's not possible! I have a boyfriend. Holding my hand for everyone to see. What about my reputation? Dude, you connected with him in a dance. It's totally cool. But everyone was watching! Did you see her just fold in half? Totally folded. Who does she think she is? I'm a much better dancer than her. (Kennedy) Totally better. Did you see the way she was looking at him? No. No. I didn't see anything. Nothing to see really. It's just a dance. No biggie. -(chuckles) Yeah... Totally just a dance. Yeah! A total dance of love... (chuckles) Thea's going to destroy me. Oh! Should I just tell her it's the legend? Yeah... no. Why are cats scared of trees? Why? -Because of their bark. (all laugh) (classical piano music plays) (Max) Ah. -(students gasp) I'm really sorry. (whispers) Once more? Come on. (Jeff) Argh! Darn it! Maybe I can show it to her, sir? I know the choreography. As long as you don't butcher it, be my guest. (all applaud) (Etienne) Nailed it! Bravo. Switch parts. If that's what you think is best. No, please, let me try again. We don't have that kind of time. Let's go. From the top. (machine whirs) This is so far out. It's a portal which allows you to travel during non-portal times. If this works the way I think it does, it could penetrate the bubble Lena's in. Seriously? Then how do I find one? You don't. Oscar, if this helps me get to Lena, I need to find one. You'd have to build it, but... Come on! We built a model, we can definitively build the real thing. But you could damage time... forever. (Frank) Yes! I can see the plans. (Clive chuckles) I know I kept making mistakes but I was distracted by the legend. There is no way she's stealing the Fairy from me. As much as I'd like to agree with you about this so-called legend... Okay, if I was talking about analytical geometry, you'd swoon. But because this is about L-O-V-E, you get all weird and shifty. No, I don't! So what're you going to do? I am not losing The Fairy. (Ines chuckles) (Dash) Yes! (laughs) (makes winning noises) (Ines) OK. Give me a controller and winner gets to be Tree number 1. Is that even a thing? -Yeah. Queen of the Forest. (Dash) OK. Give me the controller. Game on! -Dash Khan. Tree number one. (Dash) Let's do this! (music plays) (Ines and Dash make playful noises) And, 360! -And 360 the other way. Up and down! And up and down! Ah, ah! Queen of the Forest! Queen of the Forest! Queen of the Forest! Bam bam! Here we go, here we go. (laughs) I'm gonna take you down! Paw! Boom! Okay, watch this. Boom, tsh, down! (all) Whoa! (Ines) Ten. Ten. Tough break. Tree number 2. (Dash) Haa! (classical piano music plays) She's so good. -(Kennedy) She's so pretty. I love her knees! -What? Earth to Lena. That's the wrong choreography. The role of the Fairy was given to the dancer who can actually perform it without falling flat on her face. As in... moi. (Jeff) Trays down, traitors! You cannot engage in a competish without me. What if my destiny is to become King of the Trees? How dare you deny me. I'm a really good tree! You snooze, you lose. (scoffs) There's no snoozing. I don't lose. Not gonna happen, buddy. How about this. I challenge both of you to a Tree-off. OK, I'm in. Even though I'm already Queen of the Trees. (Dash) You won a video game. Hardly falls under the tree category. I'm in. OK. Who can hold the tree pose the longest. We have two minutes until history. No challenge is too great. (Ines chuckles) Whoa! -Easy! Oh! (laughs) I'm the King of the Tree... Whoa! This is going to work. This will create an intense gravitational field. Getting the balance will be kind of tricky, though... Is that long division? (whispers) Cause I was never any good at that. No, Clive. It's a miracle. Supplies. Get them back here. Immediately. Boys. We're going to create our very own time transporter. (Jeff) Oh yes! Paper over rock. (Dash) Scissors cut paper. This was dynamite. Rematch. -Sorry to interrupt... whatever this is. Can I borrow you? OK. Timeout. (Jeff) Whoa, whoa. Usually you finish a match once it's started... We need to settle this. OK. New game. First person to say ballet is out. Same with the second. (Jeff) Wow, harsh challenge. Not! Dash? I was gonna say, I was wondering if you wanted to grab a bite to eat after class? Yeah. Sure. OK. Right after ballet tech, yeah? (chuckles) She got you! -Oh man. That was deep-rooted sabotage. Nice. You totally said ballet. Oh. And so did you. -(Jeff sighs) And that makes me, Queen of the Forest. And Tree number 1 to you, boys. (Jeff) She isn't Queen of the Forest... It's still a date, yeah? -No... OK. Could you dance Max's part with me? I need to not be distracted by, you know... (whispers) The legend. But Lena... what if you fall in love with me? Ines. I'm serious! -(laughs) Okay, sure. I can do it. Check it, chica. Watch and learn. Relax so I can take the lead. (chuckles) Not funny! -Well, that is how he talks, Lena. OK. So don't freak out. But the boy has to have his hands tightly around your waist. That's normal nowadays. It helps you to balance. OK. -OK? Henri helped me with this. He was always there for me when I needed it. Haven't you stopped since I left? I've got to get this. Here. Hold on to me. -OK. (laughs) No, Henri. OK. Here. OK. (Lena laughs) OK, let's try again. (gasps) Henri! I'm doing it! -Yes, you are! Thank you! -(both laugh) Relax, chica. Why is she dancing my part, at my school, with my boyfriend? With her eyes closed! It's just a dance. (Etienne) Stop. Do it again. (Ines) Boys. I believe I should be center stage. Fetch me my fan, Tree number 2. (scoffs) Last time I checked I was Tree number 1! -(Ines chuckles) (all cheer and applaud) Brava! Brava! Brava! (whispers to herself) It's just the legend... That was awesome. (beating heart, ticking clock) (machine whirring) I feel weird. Something's wrong. With Lena, I mean. I can feel it. That's love waves. Is that in the travel book? Page three thousand and six. We need a mathematician or a scientist or something. Do you know anyone? -Do I ever. Einstein was here once. Isaac Newton comes by every now and then. I can feel it again. I need to go. I'll be back later. See you later. Love waves... I still can't get over the look on Thea's face! It was your part to begin with. I'm just glad I got through it without succumbing to the legend. (sarcastic) Yeah... that was something. Thank you. A handwritten letter. Of course. Thank you. Don't ever steal my part again. Or you'll regret it. I promise you Lena, who-ever-you-are, you will have regrets. Big ones. What are you talking about? I was the Fairy. You stole my part. I just took it back. That's not the point! Should I be worried? Maybe a little bit. I noticed a Tae Kwon Dooh class on the school announcement... -Do! Tae Kwon Do class on the school announcement board. That's the defensive arts, right? Yeah, you're learning. And, it's not a bad idea. Oh! Stop it! (chuckles) (both laugh) (Lena) And in the end, I stood up for myself and got the part back. It was kind of a milestone day. Oh... I need to record that one! (Lena into phone) Dear Video Diary. I totally did it. And it was amazing! Henri... I wish you were here. I miss you. Good night, Henri. (whooshing, clock ticking) (Henri) Things here have been challenging. But I've made some headway. I think we've found a way to get to you. It's not for sure, but worth investigating. I miss you so much.
