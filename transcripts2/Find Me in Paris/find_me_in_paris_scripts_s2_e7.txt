 My name is Lena Grisky and I go to the best ballet school in the world. I have a secret. I'm a time traveler from 1905 and my boyfriend Henri is doing everything he can to get me home. Previously... I found out the truth about Ines and Pinky. Ines, run! He's a Time Collector! Lena, stop. We're working together. How could you? And I had to work with them to get Henri back from time jail. Ines saved the day by stealing some codes from the Time Collectors. I don't understand, it should be here. Only, she was so distracted, she missed her Grand Prix audition with Armando.

 Clara and Lena. Max and Isaac are also fighting for the male lead and things are intense. Hey. That's what it takes to be the best. May the best dancer win. Oh, thanks. I didn't think you'd concede so easily. You wish. But hey, there's plenty of other parts for you since Damien's mine. I love the confidence, bro, but I always snag the lead. It's just the way it is, so... Good. Good. This, my bros, is progress. Okay? Let's keep this whole vibe and not go all competitive bonkers, okay? Okay, good. Good. Good. This is good. You're going down. Breakfast?

 I'm so hungry. Not as hungry as I am. Okay, hold up. Time‐out. Both of you get a time‐out. Hm? Thank you. Lena, I know I messed up, but you've got to believe me when I tell you how sorry I am. Henri is gone. We were finally together and now he's missing. And you chose Pinky over me. No, I was trying to get Thea back. I knew you wouldn't go for it, but I knew he'd let me see the portal. That's all, I swear. Really? Really. I mean, he's cute and everything, but we needed to get to the portal and we need to bring Thea back. Lena, I'm sorry. Okay? No, it's my fault. How is it your fault? None of this would've happened if Thea hadn't found my timepiece and gone through the portal. I can't do this alone. Look, I'm on your team. We outsmarted them. These are the files from Victor's office. It'll get us Henri back. Way to bury the lead. You wouldn't even look at me. Let's go get Henri. Maybe after class then? Yeah. I would like you to pick a dancer from history, and I would like you to tell us why and how they changed, influenced or contributed to ballet in a significant way. But instead of writing it down, you're going to present it to the class. 'What's our plan? What if we both go spiraling through time?' Uhm... What I mean is... spiraling through time... to find the perfect ballerina. Like, say, 1905... uh, and retrieve Anna Pavlova, the Russian prima who danced Menkin's Ondine. What if I traveled through time and brought her back and introduced her to all the students at this school? Take note, everyone. This is exactly the kind of passion that will get you an A+ in this class. I've seen enough. Your technique is extraordinary. Your strength, your precision. I have found my Étoile. See you in rehearsal. You're going to be in a show with the company. For Menkin. And you're the star. I know. I'm finally where I belong. Oh... These shoes are useless. They're so hard. I don't know how any of you dance in them. My feet are killing me. Uh... Alright. I hope you're all warmed up. Because we're getting straight into the choreography. Let's go. I want to see your best Damien. He's the lead. So impress me. And... five, six, seven, eight. You, you're out. You and you, you're out. Quickly. Quickly. Okay, take a breath. Pst, Jeff. You're tensing right before you jump, which makes it look like you're hesitating. Think of jumping over a puddle. Okay. Thanks, man. Unless you want to be face down in that puddle, I'd do the opposite of what he just said. Okay, let's start again. Focus. And... five, six... - Don't push me. - Stop! Again. This time without the childish shoving. Yes? In fact, Max, there. Isaac, there. The rest of you, stand by. I hope you didn't exhaust yourself trying to impress him. That was the warm‐up, he's just getting started, rookie. And... five, six, seven, eight. Stop! Stop! If you're going to behave like ten‐year‐olds, you can go and join their class. No, I'm serious. Go and join their class. Division six, boys class. Now. Now! This must be the trap set by the Bureau. The code should override it. Guys, I think I might have almost figured out a way to get to Henri. Well, that's no surprise. Because you're so smart and beautiful. Hello? Yes, Ms Carré. I'll let her know. She's on her way. Ines, Ms Carré has been trying to reach you. Armando is calling you to audition. He wants to see you. He's giving you another shot. Now! Go! You have to run. Wait. Now? Uhm... okay. I'm not really prepared but... You're always prepared. You're an incredible dancer. Okay... Okay, I've got this. I'll wait for Henri in case he comes out of the portal. Okay. Uh... You two don't touch anything, okay? I think this is going to work out, okay? And... thanks, Lena. Good luck. Yeah, great luck. That's enough. What do you have to say for yourselves, gentlemen? Sorry, Ms Carré. Yes, sorry, Ms Carré. For? For acting out and focusing on each other instead of the dance. You're dismissed. Truce? My guy was way better anyway. You can't be serious. My kid could do like seven pirouettes and he's only ten. That's raw talent. Yeah, but he was distracted. My kid had the focus of a ninja. Great lesson. Yeah, yeah, I'll take that to heart, for sure. What did you do? She said not to touch it. How could I? You haven't taken your eyes off of me. Is it working? What if this is our only chance to get Henri? No. Don't do it. We don't have the codes, you'll end up in time jail, too. We do have the codes. And we know that you and Frank are double‐crossing us. What? Ines has had the codes this whole time. Looks like my best friend is smarter than yours. Wait, no! Oh, come on! Henri. Lena. Oh... I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I'm better now. How... How did you get here? And how do we get out? Oh boy, I really didn't think this through. At least, now you know how that feels. I just want us to get back home. I take it by "home" you don't mean 1905? Not this again. We're in time jail. I'd settle for just getting out of here. I wish you'd just give my world a real chance. Come on, I've tried. You know I've tried. I just feel so out of place there. I even feel out of place around you with your friends. What does that mean? You're so different. Of course I'm different. I've traveled through time to another century. I just wish we could be together, like we used to be. Well, I'm not ready to go back. Oh, thank goodness. I thought my feet were going to fall off. Is that raw meat? Oh, gross. Oh, yuck. I think I just went vegan. Is that how you soothe your feet? Just try it. You'll thank me. 'I thought this would get your attention. I didn't think raw meat would be your thing. Meet me for a surprise.' What in the world is that? It's heaven, Claudine. It's pure heaven. Okay, I've seen enough. You're distracted. No, sir. Just a bit nervous. Libertalia is focused and driven. That was neither. Not your best work, was it? Okay. You're dismissed. I wasn't sure if you'd show. Well, the ice pack was a welcome surprise. Where did you get something like that around here? There's a lot more where that came from. Right this way. Password. McFly. Go on. Wow. Wait... What is this place? And why is it so dark in here? This is the time travelers' market. Time doesn't exist in here. You can get anything you want from any time period. Not just anyone can get in, though. It's super exclusive, but you're with me, so you're golden. This is totally wicked! You just saved my life. Or at least, my feet. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh man, Ines is going to kill me. First Henri, now Lena. This is all my fault. And I should be helping Frank find Clive. Who are you talking to? Myself. I do that when I'm nervous sometimes. Why are you nervous? Where's Lena? You lost my best friend? Yeah, well, you stole the codes. That's hardly the same thing. We need to get her back. Okay, okay. How can I help? I think you've done enough. It's not my fault your friends keep jumping through the portal. But you didn't stop her. Okay? Despite your childish behavior this morning, I've decided to give you another shot at Damien. Thanks. Thank you, sir. Yeah... Focus. Don't mess this up. You don't get to be a teacher and a parent. You chose to be a teacher, so now you have to back off. If I go down in flames, that's on me. Oh what, you thought I'd be his favorite? Guess again. You have no idea how hard it is. No, it's just... I've never seen anyone stand up to Mr Castillo before. It's inspiring. Are you boys quite finished? Good. Music. And... one and two... Why did you do this? Everyone needs help adjusting when they feel displaced. Actually, I meant, why are you a time traveler? Or whatever you are. A long time ago, the Bureau were the good guys. Then they weren't, so we've been fighting them ever since. And now they have got Clive, so... So I'm even more motivated. Do you like it? What, traveling through time? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I love it. It's an adventure, you know. Plus, I got to meet you. Is this thing going to work? We have to try. I've changed the codes. It was a simple set‐up. Hopefully it means it gives us long enough to get in and out. I go in alone. I can't risk you going to time jail. No. I hold on to you. Human chain. Deal? Deal. I'll squeeze your hand when I've found them. Don't let go. I won't. Lena? Henri? Please work. Please work. Do you see them? Pinky? Got them, pull us out. What just happened? That was crazy. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. I mean, Ines is the one to thank. We have to go to school. Uh... yeah. Walk me back? Yeah. I think we really need to stop time traveling. It's too dangerous. Yeah, you're right. As long as we're together and we're safe, then I'm happy to stay here with you. You are? Really? Really. Being away from you for so long... I just don't want to lose you again. I better go, before you get in trouble. Okay, see you tomorrow. See you. Okay. Okay. - Hi. - Hey. Uh, I was just... I was just going down to the tunnels to rehearse some stuff for the BLOK. Uhm... Oh. Uhm, okay. Do... Do you want me to meet you down there, then? Uh... Yeah. Uhm... Yeah, sure. If... If you want to. Uh... Unless you don't want me to. No, no. Uh... Whatever you want to do is cool. Okay... Okay... Uh... Uh... Are you stalking me? 'She might be even smarter than you, Frank. And she's so beautiful.' Alright, come on, you already know that part. Move on. 'Frank, she might help us save Clive.' Friends? Of course we are.
