 [ Sniffles ] Thanks. Sad-One: I told you Boot Body would be funnier. Wait! Are we leaving  Atticus behind? [ Thud, Atticus whimpers ] He's not Atticus anymore. [ Whirring ] Your number's  going up! You're losing progress,  Miss Tulip. What progress? Atticus is gone, and my number's not gonna change that! Nothing  will ever change. I'm stuck on this train forever. Female voice: Fatalism doesn't  suit you, kitten.

 After all, you're my favorite  person arbitrarily named after a particular  kind of flower. Glad-One:  One that bounces back! Quite right. Now, as you've  no doubt noticed, I'm trapped beneath  the weight of... [Grunts]  childhood escapism. Might I propose one  last bonne affaire? If you help me -- I help you,  then we're done. No more trades. But...  what would you gain? [ Sighs ] Now, to hold up  my end of the deal. I don't ever want to talk  to you again. But wait! There's still time  to cure the dog! [ Growls ] [ Yowls ] Don't you dare  lie to me again! No lies!  He can be turned back, and the solution  is in this tape. Last time I saw  one of these, I almost got trapped in my own memories forever. That's because it was  your own tape. This one belongs to...  another. And while it's admittedly  a little voyeuristic, it's not dangerous. Oh, sure. You've only lied to me  twice now. Why not go for a third? Glad-One: Yeah! Fool her thrice,  shame on me! Our goals aren't  wholly dissimilar. The Conductor  tried to kill me. [ Thudding, Atticus whines ] [ Sighs ] Fine. But you're  watching it first. Deal. [ Whirring, static buzzes ] [ Gasps ] [ Buzzing continues ] Ugh. [ Gasps ] ¶¶ Took you  long enough. Luckily, I was in dire  need of a cat nap. Glad-One:  Sleeping's creepy. Aah! One-One!  How'd you get here? I followed you. Yeah, but how? I 'unno. So, the glorified wind-up toy  will be joining us. Sad-One:  I am glorious. [ Static buzzing ] So... what exactly are we looking  for here? We'll know it  when we see it. Fine. But if you hated  the Conductor so much, why'd you help him? Je suis désolé. I thought if I found you,  I'd be left alone. Glad-One:  That's funny! That didn't work  at all! [ Laughing ] [ Gasping ] [ Laughing continues ] [ Laughing subsides ] No.  It didn't. [ Static warbles ] [ Warbling ] Excellent work, Alrick. Perhaps you should spend less  time with your toys, Amelia. It's not a toy. It's a crystal radio. Who's this goof? Someone  very important. [ Whoopee cushion farts ] [ Laughter ]  Ugh! Mark, I know it was you. [ Laughs ]  Again! [ Whoopee cushion farts ] [ Whoopee cushion farts ] [ Laughter ]  Ugh! One-One,  did you do that? Glad-One:  Yeah! I did! Again! Ball, cease this  foolishness. Sad-One:  Fine-uhhh. One-One,  how did you do that? Glad-One:  I 'unno. Wha--  [ Bell rings ] [ Indistinct talking ] Man: Engineering. Derived from the Latin words  "ingeniare," to contrive. This memory better not be another waste of time. I can't do this. There are too many people. You wanna  make a run for it? Bunk off before  they hand us diplomas? [ Laughs nervously ] Here. Congratulations, class of '76.  [ Cheers ] Wait...  is that...? [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Both laugh ] Quick, in here. [ Laughs ] No change  to call a cab, love. Wait, there's a new trick  I learned. If we play the right tones  into the receiver, we can control  the network. [ Plays tone ] [ Line ringing ]  Woman: Hello? Whoa!  It worked! Hi, y-yes,  we need a taxi. Tell 'em  we're sopping wet! [ Giggles ] Shush.  Shh. Shh. Shh. [ Indistinct talking ] No, no, not you. Yes, you! We're very dry. 100% dry. Very dry. [ Indistinct talking ] [ Both laugh ] [ Groans ]  This isn't helping. [ Static warbles ] [ Game pinging ] [ Robotic voice ]  A-mel-i-a. The Conductor? Mm-hmm. It is I, your normal boy-friend. I am a hu-mon. This is how  I sound now. I do hope that it's  acceptable. Oh, very acceptable. But you're obviously  a robot. [ Gasps ] And me? I'm just a simple hu-mon. But perhaps we can bridge  the gap between our two  civilizations. So... what do you think? Oh. ¶¶ Sad-One: Plato says love  is a serious mental disease. That, we can  agree upon, ball. So, this is the Conductor's tape? He's just some... British guy? What happened to him? So impatient. Just watch. No! We're done  wasting time! I want to save  my friend! Glad-One: Let's blow this joint,  Miss Tulip! [ All screaming ] [ Grunts ] Hey, c'mon.  Please, open up, [ Muffled ]  Look, I know it's hard, but it'll be good to go. We're all here for you. [ Thunder rumbles ] Uh, where's Amelia? Sad-One:  Gone forever? Well, the service...  it's starting now. [ Static buzzing ] Wha! [ Panting ] [ Grunts ] [ Panting continues ] [ Groans ] Why can't we reach him? The tape reflects how  each memory was stored, and the Conductor keeps  this memory at a distance. Sad-One:  Beaten by the system. One-One, you rewound  this tape earlier, and you made us fall. Can you get us  a better view? Glad-One:  I think so. [ All screaming ] Ah. Huh? There!  Take us in. [ Warbling ] What the...? Let's follow him. Amelia? [ Warbling ] [ Static buzzing ] [ Gasps ] Amelia. She's stuck here  like me. Oui. Once upon  a train, there was a different  Conductor. Until Amelia arrived and ousted them for her own purposes. How does this  help Atticus? We're right back  where we started! Information is power,  kitten. Notice anything...  important? Cannons. Wait, so, uh, the Conductor  repurposed that cannon? Which means...  I could repurpose it, too. I-I could use it  to save Atticus! Ta-da. You dragged me  through a tape when you could have just told me  that in the first place? Oh, I guess I should've just told you how to save the dog? Yes, you should have  just told me! [ Gasps ] But where's  the showmanship? Don't you get it? Seeing her tape  just made things harder! It was easier when I thought  the Conductor was some heartless  robot thing. She turned Atticus  into a monster. I don't want to feel  bad for her. [ Sighs ] But now I know she's a person  named Amelia, who was in love and... she's hurt. And she's running away  from the changes in her life... ...because she's afraid. [ Sighs ] Like me. [ Warbling ] [ Energy blasts ] [ Gasps ] [ Warbling ] Home... Glad-One:  Hooray! Now you'll be  gone forever! Sad-One: To be clear,  that's a good thing. [ Atticus whines ] ¶¶ No. I can't leave while Atticus  is still a monster. But what about  your door? I'll just have to take it  with me. If the Conductor  is just a person and the train  is just a machine, then what's stopping me  from doing what she did? [ Grunting ]  I-It's like programming. W-We're gonna use your shuttle  as a controller. I saw that the train has  some kind of input socket next to the door. [ Shing! ] [ Mechanical whirring ] How do we connect the shuttle  and the input? Glad-One:  I can help! Did you just break  my shuttlecraft? Sad-One: Depends.  Who's asking? [ Energy surges ] My paws are your paws. Where to, kitten? Take us to the engine. ¶¶ [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Atticus whining ] 3boodR 3boodR [ Energy surging ]
