 ¶¶ [ Wheels clacking ] There it is. The end of the train.  Wrong, kitten. The beginning of the train. ¶¶ Ooh, the Engine  has a splinter. Amelia's building  more train cars? The train is never finished,  kitten. Do we have to go through the new car to get there? You will have to go  through the new car,

 for this where I bid you adieu. What? No! Stay! Tut tut. I've held up my end  of the bargain. I gave you a lift for free,  which was very generous of me. Well, I-I guess... goodbye... Cat. Uh, is it "Cat"? The Cat. Well, thank you  for doing the right thing. I always do the right thing. ¶¶ [ Engine whirring ] ¶¶

 [ Sighs ] [ Growling ] ¶¶ ¶¶ Glad-One: Is Evil Atticus hungry? He's not evil! Sad-One: Uh, nature versus nurture. [ Grunting ] ¶¶ Hmm. Glad-One: Do you think my mum is in there? I don't know, buddy. I want you to stay  in my backpack, okay? [ Snarling ] ¶¶ Hey, Amelia! Loved your movie.  Get out! You'll damage the new car! You're at zero! You got your exit. What are you still doing on  the train, you little monster? I'm here to make a trade. I get Atticus back, and you... get your tape. [ Gasps ] [ Panting ] Where's that cannon? Huh? [ Alarm blaring ] [ Crackling ] ¶¶ Huh? Glad-One: Ooh, you found  the monster cannon. Sad-One: Now we can make more.  Give it. No, we're here  to un-make monsters. Ugh. Which one will change  Atticus back? Glad-One: None of these are  corgis, silly. Huh? ¶¶ Uh.  You insensitive -- How dare you force me  to relive those memories! Just returning the favor, lady. If you don't take your exit now, I'll send it so far down  the train, you'll die of old age  before you see it again. I'm not leaving until Atticus  is back to normal. And I thought you were smart. [ Beep ] [ Chugging ] [ Gasps ] Wha! Huh? ¶¶ Huh? [ Grunts ] [ Snarling ] I'm going after the cannon. I need you to look for a way  to stop the Steward or stop the train or something. Sad-One: End it all.  Got it. That's not what I --  ugh! ¶¶ [ Panting ] ¶¶ Unbelievable.  Again with the turtles. You built that weird car with the turtles in it! And this is  your college campus. You're trying to make a car  of your old life. Of course I am! You keep a pipe  in your backpack? It's a Donut Holer! ¶¶ Glad-One: ¶ Looking for a way  to stop the Steward ¶ ¶ Stop the Steward,  stop the Steward ¶ ¶ Looking for a way  to stop the Steward ¶ ¶ so we can turn Evil Atticus  back to a dog ¶ Sad-One:  Ugh, too many syllables. [ Grunts ] You can't just make  whatever car you want. Why not? I'm just trying to create a car  with Alrick in it. What if you could create  a car, Tulip? One where your parents  are still together. But... then they wouldn't be  my real parents. It wouldn't be my real life. They weren't...  happy together. I could make you a car  where they are. I can make a car that's exactly  how you want it to be. Just one big, happy family. ¶¶ You can't even make a car  without any turtles in it! ¶¶ [ Gasps ] Stop!  You'll destroy everything! ¶¶ A corgi orb. ¶¶ Argh! ¶¶ I've just been trying to keep  One at bay. One what?  [ Gasps ] One-One! [ Blasting ] ¶¶ Mum. You foolish girl! This was never about you! Well, you made it about me when you attacked my friends! Gotcha! Unh! Uh! [ Weapon charges, fires ] Argh! [ Screeches ] [ Blasting ] ¶¶ [ Exhales calmly ] [ Fires ] [ Thwack, whimpering ] No!  Oh, my. No dog and no parents? Who will you lose next? Glad-One: Upsy daisy. Whoop! No! Unh! [ Powering down ] [ Beeping ] ¶¶ [ Beeping ] ¶¶ Atticus! Unh! [ Gurgling ] [ Birds singing ] [ Whirring ] Unh! [ Mechanical hissing ] Aah! [ Grunting ] ¶¶ Oof! ¶¶ [ Groaning ] Tulip! Atticus! Hey! Oh, scratchy, scratchy! [ Laughing ] ¶¶ [ Gasps ] Thank you. I was feeling rather  exposed without it. Sad-One: Hello. I'd like to  introduce you to my mother. Glad-One:  Isn't she pretty? She's got a real heft to her. One-One, you're the real conductor? Uh, you've just been trying to get back to the Engine? Glad-One: Yeah.  It's a little weird, huh? You ripped One-One out  of the control panel! He had all that power and he refused to make a car for me. You can't keep trying  to recreate your old life. You have to learn  how to live in this one. Don't you get it? I don't want a life  without Alrick. [ Sobbing ] There's a hole in the Universe where Alrick used to be. Why won't the train just let me put him back? I'm really sorry  about your husband, Amelia. I don't know what it's like  to lose someone you love. But, I-I do know that neither  of us can go back to the way things were. We have to adapt to the changes  in our lives. It's the only way things  can get better. It doesn't matter. I'll be on the train forever. Numbers don't just go down.  They also go up. Y-You can still try to get  your number to zero, no matter  how many mistakes you've made. What about getting rid  of your exit car? There's no coming back  from that. Glad-One: Hello!  Mum and I can fix that. [ Screeching ] ¶¶ Wha? ¶¶ What in the name of Mustard  and Stink Tail is that? Sad-One:  An exit can appear in any car. It's just a matter  of unlocking one. Glad-One:  And zero is the key! I'm very uncomfortable  with how much I've missed. I'm not stuck on the train  anymore? But now I have to leave you two. I-I wasn't ready for it  to happen all of a sudden like this. You a-and this and -- and I -- it was -- and Atticus,  and now -- Glad-One: Me, too. Atticus:  Though my heart is heavy, I am honored  to carry the weight, for it will remind me of you. I'll miss you. Glad-One: Okay. Wait, wait.  Hug. Hug first. [ Laughs ] Come here!  Group hug! [ All laughing ] ¶¶ Goodbye, Amelia. I hope you get  your exit someday. Hm. ¶¶ I love you guys. ¶¶ Tulip! Your dad is here to pick you up for camp! Coming! Hey, Dad! Hey, you. Have a great time. Call me when you get settled in? I will. I'll get her there safe. ¶¶ So, bud, you ready? I'm ready for anything. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ [ Whirring ]
