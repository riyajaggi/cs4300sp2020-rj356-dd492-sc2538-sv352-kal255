 Here you go. Don't forget to get the ones  in the back. Sad-One: You're not my dentist. Tulip, hello. So, with the humidity  in that luau car, along with the hard floors here, my fur and I seem to be having  a disagreement. Well, I think it kinda  suits you, but... Very regal. I appreciate it. Glad-One: My tartar is under control! I can see that. Alright,  you two ready? -Ready!  -At your command.

 I declare bankruptcy! ¶¶ -[ Grunts ] Whoa!  -Whoa! [ Grunts ] ¶¶ [ Whimsical music plays ] ¶¶ Hmm.  No exit in sight. Glad-One: Miss Tulip,  look at all these mums! I guess we could just  stand here, not moving, and give a real hard look,  out here on the floor, where we won't be distracted. Again, without moving. Or I suppose we could take  a quick break to... [ Panting ] Oh! [ Laughter ] Whee! [ Sighs ] Now, this is the kinda thing I'm gonna miss when I get home.  Home? Weren't you trying  to get to Oshkosh? Well, I mean, I was trying to get to game design camp, but it's over. Now I just kinda  wanna go home. Hmm. Hey, Atticus? Thanks for sticking with me through all this. Ptoo! A king needs  to avenge the wrongs committed against  his kingdom. Turning a blind eye  to what that monster did isn't an option. But you don't need me  for that. I've got a lot of stuff  going on, stuff that you don't  have to deal with. Tulip, everything  we have dealt with, we have dealt with  as a team. I have never questioned  our alliance or friendship, the latter of which  I value more. Thanks.  You're a good boy. I'm a good man. Muffled voice:  Heroes! We need heroes! Glad-One: He could be anywhere. Oh, my jeepers! Are you three the champions  I've been waiting for? You are in luck. I am Atticus,  King and Uniter of the Cardigans  and the Pembrokes. Well, I'm Khaki Bottoms. And all of the cotton  is rushing to my head. Sorry, Mr. Bottoms. I'm Tulip,  and this is One-One. Glad-One: My cotton is where it's supposed to be. Look at you three! This is perfect! I have an artifact  that needs to be returned to its sacred  holding chamber -- the Jiggle Wiggle. [ Chuckles ] [ Laughs ] Rewards await adventurers  who are bold. Yeah, adventure. Can't get enough of it. Bottoms up! ¶¶ The first trial  has claimed many. [ Gasps ]  I can see why. Tulip: Hmm. [ Grunting ] Miss Tulip,  without a helmet?! I live dangerously. Oof!  Ta-da! They're gonna make a statue of her one day. [ Grunts ] Uh...  [ Chomp! ] Glad-One:  We're also heroes! Tulip: [ Grunting ] We'll put that one down  as a team effort. Let's keep it up. Wait!  Bshhh! Bshhhtzhhht! Force field. You're gonna have to solve the puzzle to deactivate it. Sad-One: We could be stranded  up here for weeks. I'll split up the rations. I'll warn you.  I'm gamey. Fear not, One-One. I've danced this tango  once or twice before. ¶¶ -Ha.  -Ooh. Hmm. Hmm-hmm! A bold move. Bzzhhhhhhhhhhh-tck! Okay, it's safe to go now. Hup!  After you, champion. [ Chuckles ] ¶¶ [ Giggles ] The final test -- the punching bags of pain. -There she goes.  -Wow! Sad-One: Been nice knowing ya. [ Humming ] Ugh! [ Groans ] -Yay!  -[ Gasps ] With courage and grace, a champion rises  to the challenge. Very cozy. Oh, my jeepers! Thank you so much! I tell you few eyes get to  gaze upon its majesty. You are so lucky. ¶¶ And now the artifact can rest. And the world  is made whole again! While heroism of your caliber  can never be properly rewarded, your bravery  must be recognized. You may select any of the -- Jiggle Wiggle! An excellent choice! It's basically the most  fun thing ever. Whoa. [ Pbbt! ]  Neat. [ Crash! ]  Aah! Whoa! [ Gasps ] Oh, no, no, no, no. We gotta go!  Right now! [ Gasps ]  How do we get out of here? Oh, but you just got here! And the feast of a thousand  chicken nuggets -- No. This is serious. Where's the exit? All the way down, left,  then right. You'll get to a slide,  and the door is just outside. You need to hide someplace safe, Khaki. Atticus, One-One. -I think that --  -Shh. ¶¶ [ Grunting ] ¶¶ [ Gulps ] ¶¶ [ Grunting ] [ Both gasp ] Aah! [ Both scream, grunt ] ¶¶ -[ Growling ]  -[ Grunting ] ¶¶ Tulip, One-One,  it has been an honor, but now is the time  for you to save yourselves. No, Atticus.  Stay here. I didn't leave my kingdom  on a crusade only to cower  before my dragon. Ruff!  Atticus! [ Growling ] ¶¶ ¶¶ [ Panting ] ¶¶ Aah! [ Grunting ] Aah! Huh? This would have been so much  easier for all of us if you had just  stayed put. But instead, you go through  car after car, interfering with my plans, attacking my Steward for months. And despite all of that,  I still wanted to help you. I send The Cat to offer  you your tape, to live inside  your happiest memories. But what do you do  with my gift? You reject it, and you continue  to march against me. And now look  where you ended up. Who -- Who are you? Now that I've tracked them  down for you, may I go? Where's the robot? [ Gasps ] [ Whimpers ] One-One, run! Bring the robot to me. And then I give you  your freedom. No! I found them.  That was the deal. I did my job. Your job is to follow  directions. And I am directing you. [ Whimpers, meows ] ¶¶ [ Beeps ] ¶¶ Aah! One-One! ¶¶ One-One! And that leaves you... all alone. You killed my friends! Let's talk about  your friends. They didn't  have to be here. Wha...? They had a place  on the train, and you took them  out of it. You brought them here. You put them in danger. They were trying  to help me! They were. And this is the result. All of this is your fault. [ Sniffles ] Aww. No more tears. [ Growling ] [ Barking ] Atticus, no! You will cease  your journey. Why should I listen  to you?! Because  I am the Conductor. [ Beep! Hum! ] [ Gasps ] [ Whimpers ] [ Pew! ] [ Howls ] [ Grunts ] Atticus! [ Beeps ] ¶¶ Atticus? [ Whimpers ] ¶¶ Atticus? I -- It's okay. It's okay. Aah! [ Screeches ] [ Chatters ] [ Gasps ] ¶¶ [ Gasping ] [ Panting ] [ Snarling ] Aah! [ Chattering ] Glad-One: Miss Tulip! One-One! [ Screeching ] [ Panting ] Whoa! Aah! [ Grunts ] [ Gasping ] ¶¶ [ Grunts ] [ Screeching ] [ Snarling ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] Aah! [ Panting ] ¶¶ Sad-One:  It's okay to cry. [ Sobbing ] 3boodR 3boodR
