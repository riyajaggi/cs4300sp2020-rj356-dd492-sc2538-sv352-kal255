 (3boodR) [ Birds chirping ] [ Railroad crossing tolling ] [ Hydraulics hiss ] What are you gonna do  when I'm at game design camp? Die of boredom probably? Ugh. Yes! Way to abandon me  in my time of need. Sorry, Mikayla,  but Oshkosh calls. I'm the coding hero  Wisconsin needs. [ Chuckles ] I don't think they want their coding hero to stink up the whole state with her onion breath.

 [ Chuckling ] Hey!  It's not my fault I have  a sophisticated palette. You have  a gross palette. I think I'm gonna work on my  game some more before I leave. I wanna code those other nerds  into the ground. I thought your game was cool  when I played it. And you know how I feel  about video games. -You hate them.  -[ Imitating ] I hate them. But I like yours. ¶¶ So... When your dad picks you up  for visits, does he come in  and talk to your mom? [ Geese squawking ] Uh, yeah, sometimes.

 I guess it's weird  to see your parents talking to each other now. What do you mean weird? [ Crow cawing ]  Well, 'cause, you know... They're not married  anymore, and everything  is different. It's fine. Lots of people's parents  are divorced. Y'know...[exhales sharply] I better hurry home and pack. I-I-I'll see you on Monday.  -Oh, okay. Bye! Text me when you're at camp! You'll do great! [ Door closes ]  Tulip. Tulip, it's your dad.  We need to talk to ya. Nahhh,  she went upstairs. I don't know, Andy,  what do you wanna do? [ Sighs heavily ] Okay, game, you're supposed  to be working but watch, I'll press play  and you're just gonna die. [ Game blips, groans ] [ Jingling ] [ Exhales sharply ]  See, that's not right! [ Gasps ] [ Keys clacking ]  [ Game groans ] [ Gasps ]  Look at you! You're moving around now! Don't ever change. Thanks, "Coding is Cool" guy! [ Deep voice ]  "Why, thank you, Tulip. For with your purchase  of my book, I can finally afford  to have this ferret removed from my face." Megan: [ Distantly ] Tulip! Can  you come down here, please? [ Groans loudly ] Yeah?  [ Sighs deeply ] Tulip, I'm so sorry, but your dad can't take you to camp. What?!  What do you mean?! You -- ugh. You said if I brought my grade  up in English I could go! You -- You -- You and Dad signed  a contract and everything. I-I know, Bud. But your dad  mixed up the dates and planned a work trip  out of town. Okay, well, then why  don't you take me?! I have a 12-hour shift at the hospital tonight and then another shift  on Sunday. I thought you'd be gone  the whole time. What, so you're both too busy  to be my parents?  Hey! You guys are the ones  whose divorce keeps messing  everything up, not me! This isn't fair!  No, it isn't fair! But it was an accident. And your dad and I are still trying to figure this out. I know, we're not very good  at it yet. Good at what?  Good at being divorced? Tulip, I just mean  scheduling. What schedule?!  It's two of you and one kid! It's not that hard! Ngh. Fine.  Whatever. I can't go.  Tulip, wait! Let's talk about this!  No! I'm going back  to my game. [ Groans loudly ] [ Strains ] [ Exhaling sharply ] [ Sniffling ] ¶¶ [ Cellphone buzzing ]  [ Exhales sharply ] Huh? [ Buzzing continues ] [ Cellphone beeps ]  Hmm. ¶¶ ¶¶ [ Grunts ] ¶¶ ¶¶ [ Breathing heavily ] [ Exhales deeply ] 300 miles is not  "a quick hop." ¶¶ [ Brakes hiss ] Oh!  Well, that's lucky. [ Music whomping ] [ Gasps ] [ Grunts ] What the -- Ugh. Did I just  hallucinate a train station? Well, that's...boring. "Tulip, we missed you  at game design camp!" "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't  quite make it because I decided to fall asleep  in a field and dream about outdated modes  of transportation!" [ Groans ] [ Both screaming ] Glad-One: [ British accent ]  Are you my mum?  W-What?! What?  Am I what? Are you my mum?  Nooo! Sad-One: So you've come to bring  me the sweet release of death? Also no?  Are you a toy? You have really good speech  recognition. Glad-One:  I'm looking for my mother. I don't know what she looks  like, though. She might be large... Sad-One: Or small,  like a nurturing bagel. Are you looking for  your bagel mother, too? No.  Definitely not. Not my dad, either. [ Exhales sharply ]  Weird toy. Glad-One:  So what are you looking for? I'm not looking  for anything. I'm going to Oshkosh.  -Is that your home? It's where  game design camp is. Sad-One: So you're going alone?  Yes. Glad-One: Without your parents? I don't need them  to get there! Now go back  to being a snowman or a -- whatever you are! Sad-One: Oh, my gosh. What am I? Uuuuuugghhh--oooooh? [ Scoffs ] North St. Paul kids  probably built this. Glad-One: That door is impossible to open. Sad-One: The only way out is through hypothermia. Pfffft. [ Grunts ] This...is the train? I'm on a big train!  Like a -- Like a really weird  big train?! Glad-One: You can reach doorknobs?! How does this door  work? Are -- Are you  like a real robot? Are there other people  on here? [ Gasps ] Is this what trains  are like?  Yes! Yes to what? Which?  I 'unno. Wait.  What's in the next train car? Sad-One: It'll probably  be disappointing... Wooooooww! Oh...hmm.  Well... Called it. I wonder what  this room's for. [ Dings ] Whoa-hoah!  Back to being impressed! [ Binging up octave ] Hop! Hip! Hoop! Hoop! [ Sliding up the scale ] [ Sliding down the scale ] [ Random notes ]  Hop, hop, hipe, hoop, hop. Sad-One: Are you building a coffin? I-It's a character  from my game. I call it "Good Guys  Poppin' Bad Guys." It's the best game  I've ever made. Glad-One: How many games have you made? One. [ Gasps ]  You're joking. That's kind of a weird thing  to joke about. That's my name! I'm One!  -One... And that's kind of  a weird name to have. Unlike my name, which is Tulip  and is perfectly normal. Oh, you know  I'm getting up there! [ Grunts ]  [ Bings ] Ha-ha! [ Music jingles ] Aah!  W-What's this?! [ Gears screeching ] [ Clatters ] [ Air hisses ] One-One? Do you know  what Wisconsin looks like? Glad-One: All right, hold on.  Lemme think. I wanna say  it looks like... this?  No. This is not Wisconsin. [ Ominous music plays ] [ Thunder crashes ] Okay. ¶¶ [ Shouts ] [ Explosion ] Wahhhh! Ahhhh!  What happened to that guy?! Sad-One: You're in kind of a bad place right now. I'm not -- Oh! I don't want to be  on this train anymore! Glad-One: Wait!  Are you my mum? I forgot what you said  last time. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Screaming ] [ Panting ] [ Grunting ] [ Swishing ]  Huh? [ Grunting ] ¶¶ [ Straining ] [ Hums Boots Randolph's  "Yakety Sax" ] What are you singing?! Sad-One: It's a wacky getting-chased song.  -I made it up. [ Panting ] [ Strains ]  -[ Squeaking ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Whirring ] [ Straining ] Ahh! [ Panting, shouting ] [ Discordant tones ] [ Slides down scale ] [ Random notes ]  No, no, no, no! [ Breathing heavily ] Ahhhh! [ Shouting ] Glad-One: I can help, Ms. Tulip.  [ Pops ] Ahh!  You can do that? Ahhhh!  Ahh! [ Panting ] Gimme a wall! [ Notes slide along scale ] Alright, Good Guy,  pop that bad guy! [ Whines ] Uhhhhh, Bad Guy's turn!  [ Grunts ] One-One, how's that wall?! Glad-One: Well, it's more  of a house instead of a wall. Sad-One:  Do you want me to start over? I'll just start over.  -No! Don't start over!  [ Panting, shouts ] [ Shouting ] Sad-One: I forgot  to make a roof. Glad-One: Is that weird  for a house -- no roof? [ Panting ] This place has some stuff  that's okay about it, and some stuff  that could be better. [ Exhales deeply ] There have to be a way  off this train that won't kill me. Okay, everything has rules. E-E-Even crazy things  have their own logic. It's a train, right? Trains have conductors. One-One, is there a conductor? Please tell me you know  the answer. Conductor? Hmm... I think  we have one of those. Sad-One: But he would most  likely be at the engine. [ Ominous music plays ] 3boodR I'm getting off this train. 3boodR
