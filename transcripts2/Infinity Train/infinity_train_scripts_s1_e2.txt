 3boodR 46 down.  7 letters... One-One, how long  have you been doing this? Glad-One: I've been helping  since the start! Sad-One: I think it's a pretty powerful message. Aw. One-One, right now I gotta take care of this. So you stay here, and no more writing, okay? Glad-One: Aye-aye, Captain!  Ooofff! [ Panting ] O-kay.

 That's not weird. Sad-One: They look so peaceful. Shh.  6-inch voice. Glad-One: Did you say 60-inch voice?! -Spells!  -Spells! No angry wizards! [ Panting ] The door  should be inside of... Sad-One:  There's the gutter. Aah! Ooh! This is where I belong. [ Bell dinging ]  Huh? Aah! Aah! Whoa! Glad-One: I almost found  my mum that time. And you got the 11th-highest  score in pinball!

 Sad-One: Don't wanna be in the top-10, though. Too much pressure. Uh! This isn't  a game to me, One-One. Glad-One:  We can still have fun. Not when you have things  to do. You work first so you get  to enjoy the fun later. I help my dad  fix the go-karts, I get to drive them  before he resells them. Work first. Okay, sometimes there was  pizza during the work. And hose fights.  But all of that was still under  the work umbrella. Aah!  It was 115 before! Oh, no, no, no, no.  Did I do something wrong? Did I lose a point?  Am I being timed? Sad-One: I've seen  that happen before. When it reaches zero,  you're a gon-- You're gone forever! I was talking.  That's it? Nobody told me this number  was gonna change. Nobody said anything! Now I'm gonna die  on this stupid train 'cause there isn't  a stupid rule book! You rule in my book,  Ms. Tulip. Ugh!  I don't have time for this! ¶¶ Cat: That's right.  Step right up. There we go. Say --  I didn't catch your name. Randall.  That's a strong name. A strong name  for a strong man. An effluent man  such as yourself can turn his pile of junk  into donuts with this  truly miraculous product -- the Donut-Holer! That kinda just looks like a pipe. I'll demonstrate. Presto! Donut! This hat?  Bon appetít! Donut.  Am I going too fast for you? I get to be in charge of selling these Donut-Holers? I can start my own business?! Yes! Why, you could have  a whole sales team selling  these Donut-Holers -- with pioneers like us  right at the top! Yeah, like a pyramid scheme! Don't think of it so much  as a pyramid scheme as a pyramid team. You don't even know  the best part. This is  the only Donut-Holer certified by my close, personal... acquaintance,  the Conductor. Conductor?! H-Hey! [ Panting ] I'm supposed to be going  to Oshkosh. It's this place  in Wisconsin. And, also, my name is Tulip. I should've said that earlier. But there's  a game-design camp, and my parents  signed a contract, and I ended up on this stupid train, and I don't want  any of this! My goodness, kitten!  One step at a time. This number  keeps going down, and if it reaches zero,  I'm done for. I just want to find a way off this train, and you said you know the Conductor. You have to help me  before I die. Tell me, kitten,  what makes you think the digits  below your digits are counting down  to your death? Uh...One-One told me? Mum check!  Hmm. Much too furry. Or not furry enough. Mother check? C'est intéressant. Yeah, he's looking for his mom. But...my number... We'll get there.  Patience. Excuse me, white ball.  Is this donut hat your mother? Mmmmmm...yes? Mm. And, tell me, if I put this donut hat  on my head, will I die? Sad-One: Sure. Why not? Charming fellow, but not  the most reliable, is he? Wha-- One-One! You made me think  I was gonna die! It would be surprising  if you never died. Ugh. I'm sure the Conductor would be just  as sympathetic to your plight. I'd rush off to see him  right now, but, unfortunately,  my personal shuttlecraft has been grounded. You have a shuttlecraft? I'd fix her myself, but...you know... no thumbs. I have thumbs. I don't know anything about shuttlecrafts, but I fixed some stuff  with my dad. There's still  the issue of... my payment.  Payment? Even with my craft, it will take a week, maybe two, to get to the Conductor. That's a lot of sales  I'm missing out on. I have...$12.42. But one of the pennies  is Canadian. Money doesn't have  much value to me. I've always been more interested in the peculiar and unique. You know, I could take the little white ball  off your hands. In exchange, I will speak  to the Conductor about getting you to... Where was it again? "Wis-con-sohn"? One-One? You want to take  One-One with you? Glad-One: Ms. Tulip, we made so many donuts! D'oh!  Do you really need him, or do you want  to get off this train? Deal. ¶¶ What kind of your own boss  do you want to be? I don't think I like that word "boss." I want to feel like we're all on the same team. Team Randall! Glad-One: Ms. Tulip,  how tall are you? Oh, I'm about...  What is your hair? How am I supposed to answer that? Sad-One: Is your name Tulip because you have a bulbous head? What? No. It was when I was born. There were complications. Glad-One: [ Gasps ]  Oh, no! Did you make it out alive? Uh, yeah. It was some kind  of breathing issue. But I bounced back like a "perennial flower" or something. At least that's what my mom told me. So you could have been named after any perennial plant? Like horseradish? No! I don't know.  I didn't name me. Look, Ms. Tulip.  It's you. That's a daisy. I may not know  what anything does, but there is a gear thing here  that isn't in there. Do you know where we can get  a replacement? Oh! I know,  I know! ¶¶ ¶¶ Welcome to the Market!  Soak up your troubles! Metal squid attack got you down?  Shop your cares away! Put a little wiggle  in your step! -Ooh!  -Ah! Oh, yeah. ¶¶ Glad-One:  [ Humming upbeat tune ] Oh, very cute. I think she's cute, too. Ugh. How -- How much  for that gear over there? Ah, expensive taste. Hold the sponge! Now, that's a handsome-looking flower. You mean my personal,  heartfelt gift that I picked out for  my personal, heartfelt friend? Ah, sounds valuable! Oh. I mean,  it's not really for sale. Too late. Now that I've seen it, it's the only thing I want. Oh, the price we pay for the things we desire most... Ugh! Fine!  Just take it! Sad-One: My mechanical heart  breaks again. I hope the warranty's  still good. ¶¶ Shall we? [ Sighs ] Well, One-One... this is goodbye. Glad-One:  A new adventure! Where shall  we meet again? We...shall'nt meet again. I'm leaving the train. I can't take you with me, but you'll be with the Cat now,  and she seems nice. Glad-One: Oh.  Sad-One: If it helps you on your journey,  I understand. Sit tight,  and I'll have the Conductor sort out  this whole mess. ¶¶ ¶¶ Goodbye forever,  Ms. Tulip! ¶¶ [ Popping lips ] Uggghhh! How would you like to try  an exciting -- Not now! Okey-dokey. No need  to lose enthusiasm. Just need  a different marketing audience. Oh, wait a second! I've got vision,  my good man, and that vision  needs a team. Well, I've never been  a part of a team. Randall #3: Oh, it sounds  easy and profitable. When I started Team Randall  38 minutes ago, the mission statement was "always be there  for each other." It's more complicated  than that.  Is it? Oh! Great job asking  the hard questions, Randall. Oh, thanks, Randall. You may not always bring in the sales numbers I want, but you've got heart, and I feel like you care about me. I didn't not care! The cat was gonna help  One-One, too! Probably. I don't know. I guess I don't really know  anything about the Cat. I just... wanted  to get off the train. Listen up, Randalls. If you can get me  to the Cat, I'll take  your Donut-Holer thing. Hot dog! Hop in my body. It's not as weird as it sounds! ¶¶ Turn here  real quick! ¶¶ Cool! Gum! ¶¶ Aah! Oof! I changed my mind! I want One-One back! Sorry, kitten.  We had a deal! Glad-One: Ms. Tulip! One-One,  I shouldn't have -- One-One! Uh! [ Gasps ] ¶¶ [ Yowls ] ¶¶ Aah! Uhh! Up and over! ¶¶ Aaahhh! Ooh! Oh, yeah! ¶¶ [ Muffled ] One-One! ¶¶ Can you slip  in the cracks? "Slip In The Cracks" is my middle name -- Randall Slip In The Cracks  Randall. ¶¶ Wow! You know, you really are  a smart cookie. [ Randalls all speaking  at once ] [ Electricity crackling ]  Aah! ¶¶ Aaaahhh! Good going. Ms. Tulip! You just made  a big mistake! Good luck getting off this train now. -Have I got a deal for you!  -Aah! Say, there, you look like a smart gal. This Donut-Holer is... I'm so sorry  I gave you to the cat. I was just scared I would  never get off the train, and you made me think  I was gonna die, and that doesn't  make it okay. But you care,  and you're a good friend, and I appreciate that,  and that makes me care, and I just --  And I-I just... [ Grunts ]  I'm sorry. It's okay, Ms. Tulip. I knew you'd bounce back. Just like when your parents hatched you. 3boodR 3boodR 3boodR
