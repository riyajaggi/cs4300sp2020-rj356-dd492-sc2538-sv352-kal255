 3boodR Still 109. It's been a week. Why won't you change?! Are we stopping to talk  to our hands now? Hello, hands! Wait, do I even have hands? Uh! That cat wasted time I could have used getting off the train. We've gotta keep moving if we're  ever gonna find the conductor. From now on, we're not stopping  for anything! All right, One-One, time me!

 Ready!  -Set! Hmm. Ahem! Oh, yeah.  Uh, go. ¶¶ Look at me!  I'm a musical genius! ¶¶ [ Quacking ] So many ducks. Can you help me  find my normal eyes? Sorry, no time! ¶¶ [ Hip-hop playing ] ¶ So we mash ¶

 Mash with us! Nope, no time! ¶¶ ¶¶ Huh? -Got the time?  -No time! You're telling me?  I'm dead! ¶¶ ¶¶ [ Panting ] ¶¶ Huh? [ Growling, barking ] Look! More weird, furry ducks. Help me find the exit,  One-One. [ Horn blowing ] Salutations, two-legged stranger  and loud-ball creature. Welcome to Corginia. I am Atticus, King and Uniter of the Cardigans and the Pembrokes. I extend to you my greetings. Hi, I'm Tulip. I like...  books? Greetings, Tulip the Literate! Let me show you my kingdom. Oh, no! It's okay, I'm actually in kind of a rush to find the e-- And so commences the official  tour-ginia of Corginia! ¶¶ Does he do that a lot? Oh, yes, every chance he gets. [ Toot ] Nope, no, no, no, no! Down, down!  Go get it! Please excuse us. We just get very excited when someone new comes  through the door. Food dispensers,  belly-rub machines, gift of speech? You guys are doing pretty well  for yourselves. [ Barking ]  One-One: Wow! This is my first time  being nauseous! Wow! How many dogs are there  in Corginia? We're 400 strong, and 399 cute. Just don't tell that  to Ugly Irwin. [ Triumphant melody ] Ugh! Can I interest you  in a sunbeam to lie in? Uh, nah. One-One and I really need to-- Wait.  One-One? The sun's gonna burn out  one day. Enjoy this while you can. [ Whimpers ] No more sunbeams, no more distracting, but admittedly-fun dog stuff. It's exit time.  Where is it? Across the great river and through the twisting  Woods of Mystery, you shall find  the unsolvable puzzle door. Water, woods, door.  Got it! Thanks, King-dog.  Bye! It's Atticus, and I must  urge you to wait. One-One, time me. Ready!  -Set! [ Boom! ] [ Dogs barking,  Tulip gasps ] Yay!  Shadow puppets. Look -- I can make an eagle! What is that thing? It is the monster. Quickly, Tulip -- to the temple! ¶¶ I will admit,  there are some things I haven't told you  about Corginia. Both: Like why there's  a giant shadow monster?! Yes.  Patience, young lady. Patience? I'll never get to  the conductor by just waiting around. Let's band together and attack the monster! Impossible. Ever since it appeared,  the water has risen and ruined our city. If we try to cross the harrowing two-foot depths,  we would surely drown. Everything is going paws-up  around here... if you'll excuse the language. Let me see if it's gone yet. One-One, be careful!  Agh! Looks like I'll have to start  writing his obituary. Awfully morbid little thing,  aren't you? -Yes.  -Agh! Aah! What is it, One-One?  It's gone! I'm excited -- ahh! [ Groans ]  Let us be on our way. Didn't you want to go outside? Yes. No.  Outside? Outside? Well... Maybe.  Outside? Come on! Wanna go outside right now?! Well, well, no! Do you wanna go outside? Yes, I wanna go outside. One week ago, that was the Dog-partment of Water and Power. Now it's just the Dog-partment  of Water and Water. Wait, a week ago? That's how long it's been  since my number changed! Maybe that monster is related  to my number, and maybe if we stop it  and reach the exit door, he'll help me get off the train. That's a lot of maybes. Maybes are maybe  my favorite maybe. Maybe.  -One-One, time us. We're going in.  Wait! You'll need my help  if you intend to leave. The exit is blocked  by the un-solvable puzzle door, and it's too dangerous  to rush in alone. Pfft.  How dangerous can it be? I've faced a bunch of weird  stuff on this train. Glad-One: Some were scary, but others were dancey! Sad-One:  Dancing is scary. I assure you, the monster  does not dance. Tulip, I don't usually beg unless it's for  a tasty-tasty treat, but it seems we have  overlapping problems. Will you take me with you so  that I may help save Corginia? ¶¶ Ugh!  Fine. As long as you  don't slow me down. Excellent. I must warn you, however, we Corgis  are a proud people, and we hate being picked up. Why would you need to warn me about that? Stop! Ugh!  Please stop doing that! Stop wiggling for two seconds! ¶¶ Huh? ¶¶ ¶¶ [ Grunting ] Phew! It's the door! ¶¶ Look out!  Aah! [ Panting ] Wait... Aw!  It's just a little spider, building her little spider web. Ugh!  [ One-One laughing ] We're grossed out, right,  Miss Tulip? We've destroyed the monster. I thought victory would  taste less musty. Hmm. I also thought the water level  would go down. Yeah... [ Gasps ]  But maybe my number... Of course!  Yeah, of course! Nothing happened. No water, no number, no monster. Correlation isn't causation,  I know that! Oh! I want some answers  for the first clue I've gotten this whole time? No!  Not allowed! Miss Tulip? I could travel for years on this  ridiculous train and never escape. Why is this thing on my hand? [ Growls ] ¶¶ It's not fair. I'm going as fast as I can,  but I'm getting nowhere. Just because you can't figure  out things immediately doesn't mean it won't happen eventually. Yeah, but it feels like  every time I find something logical  about this train, it's... thrown back at me,  and I'm stuck without answers. We can't always force progress,  Tulip. After all, I didn't have  a solution to Corginia's problems until you showed up. You helped me, Tulip. Thanks, Atticus. Now, I'm not just laying on my back for nothing. Okay. Wait. How could a spider cause  that problem with the water? The shadow came from  that weird orb, but... what's that weird orb for? [ Thud ]  Hmm? ¶¶ [ Electricity crackling ] ¶¶ It's the real monster. [ Claws ring ] ¶¶ Those orbs must have something  to do with the environment. Atticus: We should attack. Sad-One:  We'll never make it. Maybe we can escape out  the unsolvable puzzle door. How do I unlock it? First, you put your paw  on the handle. Okay. Then you turn it. All right. That's how all doors open! My people have been working on this technology for decades! Let's just talk to it. -No!  -Hello! Oh! [ Blasting ] Agh! [ Barking ] Atticus! Corginia! [ Whimpers ] Atticus! Agh! Return to your seat! ¶¶ [ Tulip grunting ] Huh? Unh! [ Panting ] You're awfully shooty today. Somebody needs to spend more time in the monster dance car. [ Humming ] Huh? ¶¶ Sad-One:  Oh, you're okay. I'll just keep your obituary  on file then. [ Whirring ] My number changed. Hooray! Wait -- is that good? I'm not sure. And I think that's okay for now. Corginia will never be safe with  that monster still at large. Since you're headed  in the same direction, I request to accompany you  on your journey so that I may hunt it down  and bring it to justice. Also, you give  stellar belly-rubs. Ha, ha!  It would be an honor to be joined by such royalty. Hooray! King Weird Furry Duck is joining our team! Wait, Miss Tulip?! Don't you want me to time you? Nah. Uh? Aren't you coming? Yes! Then, come on! No, ho-ho, no, no, no, no! Ugh! We're not doing this  for every door! You wanna go outside? Yes! No! Well... Good king! No -- maybe! You can do it! Yes, I want to go outside. 3boodR 3boodR [ Whirring ]
