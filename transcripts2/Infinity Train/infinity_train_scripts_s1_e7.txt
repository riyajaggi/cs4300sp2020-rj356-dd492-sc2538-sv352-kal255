 3boodR [ Train clacking ] [ Grunting ] Why are there so many cars where I end up picking stuff  out of my hair? You're telling me.  [ Grunting ] Here, let me help. Hmm. Nail file. Tweezers. Mirror. Ah!  Okay, hold still.

 I trust you. [ Grunts ]  Success! Glad-One: Ooh! Me, next! Sad-One:  This is my cocoon now. [ Chuckles ] Hee hee hee hee! Whoa!  Everything is chrome. Glad-One: I don't think anything  will stick to our hairs here. It's like a skating rink,  but with mirrors! It's like a vain person's  skating rink! [ Grunts ] [ Whimpers, gasps ] Who is that dog  beneath me?! How has he obtained the Imperial Crown of Corginia?!

 [ Growls, barks ] Atticus, that's your reflection. Oh, this is  terribly embarrassing. I...  [ Barking ] I just [Barking] [ Sighs ] -Whoo-hoo!  -Whoa! [ Laughter ] [ Grunting ] [ Sighs ] I guess we're dealing  with another locked door or puzzle, or... Oh, man, do you guys remember... Whoa! Glad-One: No, I don't  remember, "Whoa!" Sad-One: My memory has been  terrible ever since the change. What change? My new haircut,  didn't you notice? No, look! My reflection  isn't moving with me! [ Growls ] Are your reflections  broken, too? I'm not broken. Whoa!  You're alive?! Oh, no. I'm sorry about all the times I've picked my nose  in front of you. Not gonna lie,  that was gross. Do you know why I can't open the door? Doors work differently  in this car. I have to be the one to open  them with you as my reflection. This isn't gonna suck me into a loop of my own memories, is it? Nah. We place our foot  on the ground at the same time  in the opposite direction. Then we can cross the barrier  into each other's world. I don't know about this world-switching business. Well, if you want to stay in  this car forever, fine by me. But it's gonna get real  boring, real quick. Trust me. Hmm. Yeah. I can't just stay here. -Okay.  -On three. One... two, three! Whoa! -Tulip, are you all right?!  -Yeah! It's just colder? Heh.  Ready to open the door? One, two, three! [ Grunts ] Ah. Wow, thanks,  Mirror Me! Do we do the same thing  to switch back? Oh, that's how we switch back. I didn't say I was going  to switch back. [ All gasp ]  I haven't come  this far on the train to get bamboozled  by my own reflection! Glad-One: Excellent use  of "bamboozled," Old Tulip! I'm not "Old Tulip!" Sad-One:  "Former Tulip" it is. You can keep calling her Tulip, because I'm not her, and I'm not living  her life anymore. I don't have to do your stupid coding anymore. [ Grunts ] I don't have to eat your stupid onions anymore. [ Grunts ] I'm gonna explore the world  on my own! I'm gonna touch a tree, or, like, smell something! What's something  that smells good? Sad-One: Let's see...  asphalt, gasoline, sulfur, other  petroleum-based products. If my reflection is  a separate person... [ Gasps ] Can you guys talk, too? Mirror One:  Salutations. [ Nervously ]  Um, hello. Hi. [ Barking ] No! Not again! Can you guys get me back up  to my world? I don't know!  It's basically my first day! I've only been reflected  in a river before, and he keeps barking at me! [ Barking ] Mirror One: I've already alerted  Reflection Enforcement. They'll bring her to justice. You called the flecs on me?! You little jerk! [ Siren wails ] [ Gasps, panting ] ¶¶ [ Wailing stops ] [ Slurping ] [ Exhales sharply ] ¶¶ ¶¶ You Tulip Prime? Y-Yes...I think. Don't arrest me! She said I had  to switch to open the door! No need to explain. Slivers will do anything  to get what they want. Atticus: Slivers? Cracked reflections. They're called Slivers.  Get it? We're gonna have  to go above. So get the skins... and the sander. Whoa! Hey, man, do we really need the sander for this? Oh!  You want that little defect running around  in the Prime World? We keep the barrier intact.  You got that? I got it. I got it. Put the Prime in the van. [ Sighs ] Hey, stop! Miss Tulip!  Barking ] What are you doing  with her?! She doesn't wanna  be around for this. If your reflection doesn't  turn herself in, we'll find her and we'll polish  her down to a pile of nothing. A pile of nothing? [ Gasps ]  You can't kill her! I just thought she'd go to jail or something! That shatter, that sliver  is not a person. She exists to reflect  your existence, and if she isn't serving  that purpose... then we'll make sure  she doesn't exist at all. Get this Prime  outta my sight. Hey! [ Grunting ] Let me out! Come on,  you can't do this! No, stop! Tulip! No! Hey! Huh? ¶¶ [ Soft thud ]  Huh? ¶¶ The Prime unlocked  the door! What?! [ Tires screech ]  Ugh! Stay here and keep them distracted! Stop! That Sliver just doesn't  know all the rules yet. Suit up. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ Atticus: Remain where you are,  gentlemen! I am a pacifist by nature,  but a warrior by necessity. I'm a robot! ¶¶ [ Barking ] [ Panting ] [ Gasps ] Stop! You can't  leave me trapped here! If it means I get  to be free... [ Chuckles ] ...then I'm doing it. [ Grunting ] ¶¶ [ Gasps, groans ] [ Grunting ] [ Groans, sighs ] ¶¶ ¶¶ [ Pounding on chrome ] Hey, I can help you  if you talk to me. That's funny,  coming from you. Huh? Well, what is that  supposed to mean? I have to do everything  you do, remember? You're always in your room  ignoring everyone. You never ask for help. I'm not ignoring everyone. I can just handle  my problems myself! That's completely  different! Skipping texts from  Mikayla? Pretending you couldn't  hear Mom because, "Sorry, I was just so busy making my game!" Just go away, Tulip! That's what you do best! ¶¶ Okay, you're right. I don't like asking for help  when I have a problem. I guess I should. But that proves you should  be talking to me now! I don't want those mirror police  to hurt you. Who cares what they do to me?! I can't step outside! There aren't any reflective  surfaces out there! [ Sniffles ] I don't even have a name. I'm still nothing. I'm nothing at all. No.  You're someone! If we switch back, I think  I can get you a new mirror. ¶¶ [ Panting ] [ Panting ] Bad dog!  Bad dog! Glad-One: Hello, Miss Tulip!  We're melting people! Sad-One:  So, what's new with you? -There goes the Sliver!  -We gotta go! You stay here  in the Prime World, I'm going after that Sliver! But the Buddy System!  The Buddy System! [ Grunting ] Aw, geez! [ Panting ] One-One, my multi-tool! -Okay! Ready?  -Ready! Now!  You are your own reflection! [ Sander whirring ] [ Chuckles ] [ Gasps ] Come on! [ Grunts ] I'm out. [ Grunting ] Okay, time to stand on your own two feet, please! Get him off me! Aah! [ Gasps ] Let's go! You let a Sliver out  into the Prime World! Get back here! Huh. Oh! Aaaaaaah! [ Chuckles ] [ Grunts, pants ] Huh? Hmm? Sorry, everyone!  [ Chuckles ] -Ugh.  -Oh, man. Aw, yeah. This is such a boring car  to see first. Are you kidding?!  This is so cool! Do you think they'll let me  open an account? Will I get a checkbook?  Look! Aah! It's those little pens  on chains! I used to get so motion sick when I'd have  to reflect in these. ¶¶ Here. Now no one can keep you  trapped ever again. [ Chuckles ]  Thanks, Tulip. Well, I'm glad I was able to help you. Now, come on, we'd better keep moving. Nah, hard pass. I spent my whole existence  living your life. I'm going my own way now. Okay. I don't need this glove. And you don't, either. Who cares what  the train thinks? Only you control your life. Good luck, Tulip Prime. Good luck, Mirror-- well, good luck to you, whoever you turn out  to be. [ Wind whistling ] 3boodR [ Sighs ] 3boodR 3boodR
