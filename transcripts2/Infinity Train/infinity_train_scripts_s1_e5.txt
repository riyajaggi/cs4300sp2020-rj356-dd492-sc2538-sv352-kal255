 3boodR Thank you!  We'll never forget you! [ Roars ] What was that fella's  name again? I kind of  already forgot. Glad-One: Well, I'm gonna call him Mildred the Tyrannosaur. [ Crash ]  Aah! [ Gasps ] ¶¶ ¶¶ So, cars on the train  can just move around?

 I like it!  Feels wild and unpredictable. Ohh!  What is this place? It looks  to be a study. Sad-One: What are they studying,  hoarding? ¶¶ [ Chomping ]  Hey, get out of there. What? Me? No, of course  not, no. Glad-One: Hello, me-shaped  thing! Are you my mom? And if so,  where have you been? Sad-One: Rude. Woman:  If it isn't my favorite person named after a flower  for no good reason. [ Growls ]

 Calm down, dog. Is this the cat  you told me about? Unfortunately, yes. Glad-One:  She's a real gem. One-One, last time we saw her, she tried to kidnap you. Kidnap?  Je n'oserais jamais! I seem to recall we had a deal,  you backed out, I left you alone,  and you abandoned me to the relentless splashes  of a thousand Randalls. Litter under the box. Fine.  What are you doing here? Me? Why, you're the ones  who oafishly stumbled into my humble abode. Sad-One: Nice place,  but your mom's a little quiet. Don't touch that! I apologize. Everything here is  extremely important to me. Yeah, well, it's really dusty  and boring to me, so we're leaving. Glad-One: Good-bye,  former kidnapper! Sad-One: I miss you already,  and it's emotionally confusing. Wait! Don't you want to explore  the kismet that brought us  together? Nope.  I don't trust you. That prickles my whiskers,  kitten, but I understand. Au revoir.  Oop! [ Gasps ]  Oh, my! Be a dear and help me with  those fallen items, would you? I'd do it myself,  but, well, you know. [ Grumbles ] [ Gasps ] Wait. Where  did you get this? I procure so many  wonderful things. Why? Because... i-it has my name on it. Oh, is that one yours? I suppose we ought  to give it a look, hmm? Glad-One:  Great idea! Careful, Tulip.  I don't trust it. Ooh, what  if it's important? Of course it is. This tape contains everything  that makes you you. Every passenger has one. Every passenger? Sad-One: Guess you're not special. Yes, and every one of them  has a little number from a little tape,  just like you. How's this connected  to my number? Who made it?  How does it help me? My dear, it will be much simpler  if we just watch. ¶¶ Uh...  In you go. I'm not sure  about this. Huh? [ Static hissing ]  Maybe you shouldn't -- ¶¶ Huh? [ Panting ] Atticus?! Aah!  One-One?! Aah! [ Giggling ]  Huh? I remember that. Oh, no!  Are you okay, honey? [ Both laughing ] Corn Nutters!  Corn Nutters! Bucket! Bucket!  Bucket! Mom, look! I can see Orion's belt... and part of his pants. Aww! Aah! [ Radio playing ]  Hey. You're me. ¶ Wave your hands  in the air ¶ Both:  ¶ Like you don't care ¶ What's going on? [ Dolphin chittering ]  Whoa! DolphWorld? Oh, I used to love  this place! I wonder why it closed. [ Cheers and applause ] Oh, Tulip, how about  those dolphins? They look so beautiful  in their natural state. [ Cheers and applause ]  All: A pyramid! Oh, yeah!  This day was so much fun! ¶¶ I'm home! I'm...  still in a memory. ¶¶ Are you tired of owning things  that aren't doughnuts, but could be doughnuts? Every day  of my miserable life. Then buy  a Doughnut-Holer! Easy to grip,  and certainly not a scam. Ha-ha! Certainly not a scam?! Say no more! I'm spending my life  savings on it! [ Laughs ] [ Indistinct muffled talking ] [ Static hisses ] What was that? Great news, bud! You got a full scholarship  to Vassar, the school for smart people too creative for their own good! Ah, that's better! But who cares  about school? Step aside, Shigeru. You just became Ultra-Galactic World President of game design!  [ Both laugh ] Who wants to celebrate with  double-onion ice cream cake? Me! [ All munching ] This isn't right. Something's  changing my memories! ¶¶ [ Gasps ] Aah! Get it off! Get it off!  Get it off! Tulip, how about  those dolphins? They look so beautiful  in their natural state. All: A pyramid! This isn't how it happened. Uh...let's hear it  for Dolphmu! What do you mean  she won't wake up? Oh. So, that's why they closed DolphWorld. Mom, Dad,  can we move closer? See? I told you she needed glasses, Andy. Well, maybe you should've taken  her to the optometrist, Megan. When? When am I supposed to do that? Oh, yeah.  They were fighting. Hmm. Okay, I'll be sure to add it  to my free time between my double shifts  at the hospital. Why'd the static go down? Hmm? ¶¶ Ah-ha!  Doughnut-Holer! They shouldn't be here. Man:  Harry the Bike Guy! He's woke for the spokes! It isn't a sham, I am. It isn't a sham, I am. Dad was there. [ Crying ] Huh? So, [sniffles] you're tucking me in now, huh? ¶¶ Awful news, Tulip.  We're getting divorced! Aah! Aah! Both: Divorce! Divorce!  Divorce! [ Crying ] ¶¶ [ Laughs ]  Divorce! No! This isn't  what happened, either! [ Silence ] [ Footsteps approaching ] We having dinner here  or going out? Neither.  We just want to talk to you. Talk with you. She gets it. This is how it happened. Tulip, we want you to know we both love you so much, but... things are going to be  changing soon. Changing? Uh, is this like  a puberty thing? 'Cause if so, I'm fine! [ Sighs ] Let's just go get  Chinese food and -- Tulip, sit.  Andy. [ Sighs ]  What? You might have noticed  Dad and I have... problems, sometimes... like arguments,  things like that. We've tried to fix things,  but your Mom and I decided to take some time off  from each other. Are you...okay? Yeah.  Why wouldn't I be? You're not. Are you...  getting divorced? Uh, well... right now, we're just separating. But then you're gonna  get divorced after that. "It's not  that simple." It's not  that simple, bud. Yeah, it is. You're  either married or your not. What else is there? Tulip, please. We just want you to know that none of this is your fault. I know that!  Why would it be?! Oh. I remember  how scared I was. Tulip, I'm so sorry. How mad I was. How alone I felt. Things change, but our love for you won't. We just want you  to understand -- I understand  perfectly! Things were fine, but then you  decided to change everything! That's definitely  what happened. But knowing it sure  doesn't feel any better. I guess...I was the one  changing my memories. Whoa! ¶¶ Watch that tape without  thoroughly sniffing it first! Ugh. Why, look at that!  Awake already. You tried to trap me! Can one really be trapped when  reliving such happy memories? Perhaps you want to sit down  again, give it a closer look? I saw everything  I needed to see. Let's not be hasty,  my petulant perennial! What about your number? I don't care. But it's going down! The train must think  you're doing well. [ Sarcastically ]  Oh, wow! So, it's a good thing  my number's going down? I'm growing as a person?! Thanks, Train! So glad an inanimate object  likes me! No more numbers,  no more mystery. ¶¶ Sad-One:  We don't like you. How?! [ Rumbling ]  Huh?! ¶¶ ¶¶ Where is the passenger? Um, she isn't exactly here  at present. And she may have taken  the ball with her. The tape! It should have trapped her! [ Musical chatter ] Mercy, please! [ Straining ] You know I'm the only one who can help you... find...them! [ Musical chatter ] Thank you.  I will not disappoint. Do not fail again! ¶¶ No. No!  My -- My things! 3boodR 3boodR
