 Thank you. Mel, come, come. What do you think? Yeah, it's pretty. What is it? A new tat. I'm getting it to celebrate Pride. I'm addicted. You're really lucky that you can pull those off, 'cause, like, I think there's some people who really suit tattoos and there's other people who just don't. I'm not really sure I'm cool enough. Marks and scars show a life lived. You're a canvas, honey. Don't go to the grave blank. I always kind of fancied getting a little nose stud. Then do it. Come with me tonight.

 It's only round the corner. Melody! Oh, god. Um, I should - I should probably... Bloody Myleene Klass. The ink is barely dry on the L'Oreal deal and the dumb bint falls asleep in the bath and sets her hair on fire with a meditation candle. I mean, who sets themselves on fire in the bath? She's supposed to be doing a photo shoot tomorrow and she looks like Anne Hathaway after she dreamed a dream. Have you heard from Robyn at all this weekend? 'Hey, baby. I've got us a spot at the most amazing place tonight. 'You're gonna love it. I'll send you a car. 'The driver has your number.' All good? Oh, it's Gabriel. Things OK between you two?

 Why do you ask? No reason. I mean, it's all good, yeah? Managing. Where the fuck is Robyn? Robyn. Caroline, I am so sorry about this weekend. We had a family emergency. Oh, no, no. There's no need to apologise to me for missing Duncan's funeral. I'm just surprised. He was a big fan of yours. Not answering my phone calls, however... My sister... Be very sure before you lie to me, Robyn. I'm concerned. It won't happen again. No. No, it won't because if it does, I will cut a bitch. If you're not there for your job, your job won't be there for you. Are we clear? Now jack up some coffee, go stick your tits in a plug socket, do whatever it takes to get your shit together because we have a problem. Not dead, then. Sorry, I dropped my, uh... Yeah, you dropped your phone. It was stolen by a rapist on a moped, a bee flew in your eye and you went blind. Rob, I invented ghosting. I'm not an idiot. 'Unmask the Predator' has just released the name of Alexa Wells's historic abuser. Unmask the what? Oh. It's an online forum dedicated to uncovering the identities of famous sexual predators who haven't been charged yet. Overzealous amateur investigators, but it has clout because once they leak a name, it gives the press permission to... Jesus Christ. What? Warren Armitage. What? Wait. No. I don't believe it. That man's an angel. He rescues baby otters, for Christ's sake. He's a Knight of the fucking Realm. OK, you can cry in the car. We've got to get to Alexa's before anyone else does. Get us a cab. You look like shit. I know, right? So are you gonna tell me what happened this weekend? Welcome to my office. Want a bump? Gratis. Alright. Actually... Sure, but we should get going. Um, Michael from Just Stoves has been asking about the new catalogue. Could you... Yes. I saw the email. I sent the PDF this morning. Ahh, very efficient. Nice weekend? Yeah, sure. It was, um... crap. It was pretty crappy. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's fine. Just family stuff. Ahh. Yeah, say no more. Is that a new shirt? Um, not particularly. I like it. The colour is so good on you. You look hot. Right, well, um, I-I need to catch up with Michael after lunch, so if you could move whatever I've got this afternoon, that... That would be good. Robyn, you know the deal. We're done. Stop calling me. 786, take two. Mark. Action. Everything alright? Yeah, of course, absolutely. ...some of that famous... Madam. Oh, please, don't call me 'madam'. Makes me sound like a milkmaid. Oh, my god. Lady Redhill is such a little slut bag. What is this crap? Please do not tell me that you've never seen 'An Englishman's Castle'. It is epic. It's about this aristocratic English family that are forced to sell the family home to this gauche American couple. Did you just say 'gauche'? Sh! You shush! You OK? Seem a little tense. Oh, really? So are you gonna tell me what the hell is going on? What do you mean? Tom. You were with him. Robyn... Did you fuck him? I... honestly can't remember. Wow. I just... I wanted to... Wanted to tell him about what happened... happened with the baby. I just... I'm so sorry. No, look, forget it. It's OK. Well, it's not OK, but it's not just you. It's everyone. It's my mother, it's Gabriel. I just feel like everyone just thinks that I can take it, and I ought to just feel lucky to have been invited to the party, and now that I'm here, I should just keep my mouth shut and not make a fuss and be a good girl. Now you relax. If he's going to leave his wife alone in this big, old house to occupy herself, then that's exactly what she's going to do. So, how is he? Robyn, like the superhero. Welcome. Welcome, welcome. Su casa, mi casa. Are you still going to meetings? Oh, fuck yeah. Oh, yeah. Every day. I'm off to one in a minute, actually. Do you wanna come? Oh, yeah. How's Eve? Ahh... You know, I'd like to say you look well, but I'm not sure that you do. I know that's the pot calling the kettle a cunt, but at least I never looked that great in the first place. Not like you. So, what do you want, Robyn? 'Fraid I've not really got that much left for you to screw up. I had an abortion. A spontaneous abortion. That's what they actually call it when you miscarry. Such a strange word. 'Miscarry', like it was a blip, like, "Oops, I miscarried my baby." Was it mine? I don't know. Hmm. Maybe we're not meant to have kids, people like you and me. Cut! Did I hear talking at the back? Because if I did, somebody's getting fired! We'll find out for you, Alexa. Where's my Diet Coke? Um... Mandy! I mean, how hard is it to hold a can of fucking Diet Coke? Am I done here for a bit? Um, not really, no. We still... Yeah, well, I need a time out. Get Carol to stand in. Carol! Yeah, let's go. OK, turning round on Charles. My bloody Twitter's catching fire. No kidding. You might as well have just accused the Queen of fisting a swan. We're gonna have to put out a statement. Statement? What kind of statement? Alexa, you have essentially claimed you were harassed by a Knight of the Realm. I'd say that requires at least a sad face emoji. No, I never claimed he did anything. Well, was it him? Hmm? I'm gonna need some words. Still not words. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Why couldn't they say it was somebody else? That old bastard is such a sweetheart. So it wasn't him. I knew it. Alright, who's that? This is a refugee that I adopted. Lexi baby, was it him? Because unless you want them to change the name on his blue plaque to Sir Grope-a-lot, you're going to have to start talking. Alexa, what's going on? Let's go to my trailer. Oh, my god! Her trailer! So cool. Get a grip. Eeh! You look well. Let's not waste our time on the small talk, shall we? You're about to publish a story on our client, Danny Davis, a week before he's due to present the live final of the country's most watched television programme. You feel like an overweight schoolboy sitting on a shipping container full of Twixes. However, I am not someone you want to make an enemy of, so it's in both our interests to reach a compromise. Here's what I propose. Number one, no cocaine. He has a drink problem. Not a chance. I'll give you prescription painkillers. Done. Two, no whores. Would you like me to bend over the chair? It might make it easier for you to screw me in that position. No whores, and you get an interview. The only interview. I'm still running it on Saturday. You run it on Sunday. Danny will issue an apology, by which time he'll have checked himself into rehab. You get to do your interview next week, in time to make a big splash in all the Sunday glossies. How does that sound? Pleasure doing business with you. I cannot say the same. Is Robyn about? Don't let the door smash a hole in your skull on the way out. I was 43 years old. I couldn't get arrested. My last fucking audition was for a guest on 'Holby City', which I didn't even get. So, I've been nominated for a BAFTA, an Olivier, two Broadcast Digital Awards - one which I won - a Satellite Award. I mean, do you even know what a Satellite Award is? Everything used to come to me first. People got jobs because I turned them down because I was so fucking good. Then one day, you reach a certain age, you piss off a certain director and then, bam, it's all over. Wait. How does this connect to Warren? It doesn't. I met the man once at a fundraising thing for beavers. Otters. Quite why they suggested someone as bloody old as that is beyond me. I mean, what must that say about me? They could have at least picked somebody a little bit more... You've lost me. Look, everyone was doing it. It was exciting. It felt like a moment in time, a movement, a revolution. I wanted to show my solidarity to these amazing women who were telling their stories. I wanted to say, "Yeah, fucking hashtag me-fucking-too." Wait, so you made it all up? I didn't make it all up. My story has affected so many women in so many ways. But did it happen to you? Mmm, some of the specific details and specific characters of my particular account may have been ever so slightly... fabricated. Oh, Christ. You made up a story about being sexually harassed so you could be famous again? No, I resent that. That is a gross simplification. Will somebody tell this work experience girl... Lexibaby, you made up a story, and now an innocent man is being hounded for being a sex pest. Yeah, we don't know he's not a sex pest. Alexa, MeToo was about women clearing out their dirty, inflicted shame drawers and displaying them for the world, to stop other women from being passed around like soggy cigars. You hijacked that movement because you didn't get a job on 'Holby City'. Look, if I was looking for a TED talk on morality, I wouldn't be asking a fucking publicist! You taught me this shit. You proofread my MeToo post, Robyn. In fact, if I remember, at the time, your main concern was catching the first wave! So, what are we gonna do about it? If people find out that she made it up, her career is over, and I don't mean burnt, I mean reduced to ashes. Well, there's no way that anyone will just accept a denial, unless we're prepared to give them another name. Can we not just tell the truth? What, and give every privileged white male 'Telegraph'-reading bottom-patting old scrote the story they have been dying for all along? Hashtag 'believe all women except this one' doesn't quite have the same ring to it. So what do we do? OK, look, I know it sucks. How many times has a situation played out the other way round? I can name, like, six women off the top of my head who have been fucked over this year by some guy, only to be disbelieved because of lack of evidence. We know it's not true. Oh, fuck's sake! Why are all the wrong people getting away with it? This is gonna ruin his career, his life. Think about his grandkids. Think about his reputation. Think about his work on climate change, those documentaries on polar bears and those weird fish things with those fucking horns on their heads. Narwhals. Melody, there's no evidence because he hasn't done anything wrong. You know it's not about that. This is about having your entire life's work deleted off iPlayer as if it never existed, just so some idiot can keep her swollen and expressionless face on the television. That idiot is our client. Come on, Robyn. You could think of something if you tried. Why don't you think of something for a change? Rob. Rob, calm down. Sam, you were right. I am rotten. I'm dead soil. OK. Fine. Where are you going? I'm gonna fix it. Uh, what? She's right. I made this mess and I'm gonna clean it up. I'm going to Armitage's. To do what? If he doesn't make a comment, they're gonna crucify him. Look, I can come with you. No. I've got it. Rob, are you sure this is a good idea? Shall we call Caroline? No! Excuse me, please. We're not talking to any press. Mr Armitage, I'm not press. I represent Alexa Wells. Can I please come in? ...this is your chance to say. Any quotes that we could put down from you... I don't even know the bloody woman. My wife is a little stressed. She struggles with why a woman should accuse me of such a thing for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Who does your PR? My PR? I'm not David Hasselhoff. Look, I've been in this business for over 50 years. Anyone who knows me will know that there's never been any impropriety. Mr Armitage, there's the truth, and there's perception, and if you're in the public eye, you can forget about the truth. You need to make a statement. But I haven't done anything wrong. I haven't, I swear. You have to believe me. Everything OK, dear? 'Hi, Robyn. It's me. I'm here at Duncan's funeral. 'I can't see you. I think we should stick together... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck! Oh, god! What's the matter? I missed Duncan's funeral. Oh... Who's Duncan? My old boss. God! Well, I wouldn't worry about it. He ain't gonna know, is he? He's dead. Don't do that. Please don't do that. I don't know what I'm doing here. No, stay. Just have another glass of wine. No, I-I have to go. No, no, no. Don't, Robyn. You can't just swan in here like nothing's happened. We're not all just characters in your story, Robyn. OK? We've got our own shit going on. Get off me. You ruined my life. Do you know that? That's not me being dramatic. That is not an exaggeration. You ruined my life! Get off me! Oh, my god. Anything you want to say? OK. Is there anything you want to say? I have a statement. "I've worked in this industry for over 40 years" and my reputation is by far the most valued treasure I have. It has been hard won and carefully built with patience and time..." Hello? Why the fuck am I watching you on the news standing behind Warren Armitage? He doesn't have a publicist. I was just... He's not our client. Why aren't you with Alexa? I'm just trying to help fix this mess. You're not Robin bloody Hood. What do you think it looks like, Alexa Wells's PR person showing up at the house of the man recently accused of her sexual assault? I thought... No, you didn't. No, you didn't. That's exactly what you didn't do, Robyn. You just went off trying to fix everyone else's shit because you can't fix your own. Well, boo-bloody-hoo. Your ego has just confirmed a connection between him and Alexa. It looks like we're negotiating a deal. Meanwhile, whilst you were off saving the cat, Alexa's complete lack of response only serves as a confirmation. Congratulations. You've just set the house on fire. I'm so... Don't say it, Robyn! Do not say you're sorry. That is of no use to me. What should I do? Let him burn. Hey. You look like a porn star who's turned up on set and been asked to do some actual plumbing. My dad's sick again. Ahh. Yeah. I feel... I feel guilty. Look, if you, um... You know, if you need to go back up, or... I feel guilty 'cause I don't want to go up. I want to be here. I want to be doing this. I want to be going out. I want to be getting drunk. I want to be smoking cigarettes. Guilt is empty calories, babe. Don't cry. No, because then I'll feel like I have to hug you. I haven't hugged another woman since... Since an incredibly awkward lesbian fling at university. When I say 'fling', I was Charlie Sheen drunk, and the drama society's social sec popped a finger in. I was sick in her hair. Yeah. You weirdo! I don't even feel that sad. Just angry. The world's made of two types of people, shortbread. The people who take it out on themselves, and people who take it out on others. Which is better? I don't know. 'I'm sorry, the number you called is no longer in service. 'Please check the number and try again.' Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, boy! Hey. What's happened? Rob. Robyn. Hey, this is not OK. I know, I know, but I missed you. I missed your stupid face. You're a mess. Well, whose fault is that? OK, OK. I'm gonna make you a coffee and then you're gonna go. Why are you so grumpy? It's 3:00 in the fucking morning, Robyn. You're a drug dealer. I need some shit. Considering I gave you enough yesterday to kill a black rhino, I'm not sure you do. Come on, me baba. Where's the really good shit? The stuff you keep just for yourself. Where have you been? Everywhere. I'm not selling to you like this. Excuse me? No, you can have your coffee. You can kip on the sofa. Sleep it off. I am not selling to you in this condition. "In this condition"? Sit down. So my drug dealer has a conscience now? Well, you didn't mind selling to me at 8am on a Saturday morning. I'm doing this for your own good. What about when you got me hooked on pills? Was that for my own good? You need to relax. You need to shut up and give me what I want! Hey! What the fuck? 16 hours ago, we were having a laugh, we were having a dance, and now you're acting like a little bitch. Chill the fuck out! I'm saying to you, as a friend, you're acting like an addict. We are not friends, Mike. We're not pals. Do you think I come round here because I like your stupid little stories? I come and see you to get drugs, Mike! Do you get it? So stop acting like you're gonna save me or whatever pathetic little narrative it is you have going on here, and give me what I want from this transaction. OK, I'd like you to leave now. American Mike, who's never even been to America. Get out of my house, please. I'm a customer. Get out of my house or I'm calling the police. You're a drug dealer. OK, OK. Hey, don't touch me. Get your fucking hands off me. Ahh! Oh, sh... Mike. Mike, I'm sorry. OK. Please leave. Mike, I'm so sorry. I'm not in a good place right now. I've got nowhere to go. Just show me, Mike. I'm sorry, Mike. So sorry. What the fuck is wrong with you? You need help. That's a gift. Now, I never wanna see you again, and if you ever come back here, that will not go well for you. You can't just go in there. No, it's OK, I can. We're family. Oh, can I get a black coffee? Hey, I remember this. I remember that dress. I was 19. Would that make sense? I was staying with you guys. I always loved it when you went to your fancy parties 'cause it meant I could stay up all night and not get in trouble. You don't look any different. And look at me. How are you bearing up? I'm fine. I'm... sad. How are you? It's strange. We're beasts of legacy, men. Your father is always this immutable landmark, like a river or a mountain, and particularly my dad. He was like fucking Everest. Then one day, he's gone and everything is still the same. It's like he was never here. You shouldn't look at it like that. Oh, yeah? How should I look at it? So, is this where all the bodies are buried? So sweet of you to check in on me. Thank you. Yeah, so, I thought maybe we should talk about how this is gonna work. How what's going to work? This. You and me. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Mills-Paulson. You're Mills. My dad was a partner. Silent partner, for the last few years. Right, and now he's gone and now I'm your partner. Silent partner. What do you want, Damian? I want what belongs to me. And what is that? My father built this business. Yes, your father built this business from nothing, so if you want something that belongs to you, why don't you go out and earn it? Oh, what, like you did, you mean? You have no idea what it took for me to get here. I had my daughter at 16 years old. I was alone. I had nothing. I worked my way up from the bottom. Right, and then you fucked my dad and became partner in the company, so don't you get on your high horse to me about what does and doesn't belong to who. We're both just imposters, squabbling over someone else's legacy. You can't intimidate me. Oh, yeah, well, I... I think I could if I really tried. No, you can't, because all I see is an angry 14-year-old boy. Now, I have a business to run, so if you want to talk to me, make a fucking appointment. "For reasons of my own, I am choosing to stay silent on the new allegations. I have said what I needed to say, when I needed to say it. That was for me and how I choose to deal with my situation, because fundamentally, that is what I believe in - choice - choice for every woman out there to deal with their experience in whatever way they want, whenever they want. And if that takes ten minutes or ten years, that's OK, "because it's theirs, not ours, and we are not all the same. Thank you." Yeah? Yep. OK. Hey. Where is everyone? Teddy's asleep. Kelly's reading upstairs. Reading? Did you drug her? Oh, god, what's wrong? Did something happen? Just want to talk. Oh, my god, what did you do? Are you seeing someone? Did Robyn tell you about our argument? Ruth. Stop. Sit down. Don't be angry. OK. What are you doing? I - what, are you going through my trash now? I was worried, Ruth. Jesus, Mark, that is such an invasion of privacy. I love you. Just, please don't, Mark. No, Ruth. I will. This isn't about you or me, or us getting back together, or our marriage. This is about me caring about you as a human being and mother of our children, and promising to be there for you, whenever you needed it. Please talk to me, Ruth. Um, hmm... the last time that this happened is when I found out I was pregnant with Kelly. You never told me that. Yeah. I was at the Morton Williams on Bleeker Street and they had a sample. It was some new cookie or something and, um, I just kept going back and going back over and over again. The woman had to tell me to stop. I was so embarrassed. So I got, like, a bunch of trail mix and, um, some candy or something, and I just kept - I just kept going. I just kept going and going like there was just some, like, engine inside of me. I looked down at my stomach and I just felt so much shame. I don't know. I came home and I was going through the cupboards and I was looking for something. I was just looking for anything to help... get it up, you know, like yoghurt or milk or ice cream or anything, and... Jesus Christ, Ruth. I don't know, I just... It was, like, 6:00 in the morning and I felt like my brain was pushing up against my skull. When I finally passed out, I knew that I'd done it, I'd killed it, 'cause nothing - nothing could sustain that level of abuse. I'd killed the baby. Then I went to the doctor the next day and found out that she hadn't given up on me. Oh, my god, she was still growing. She was still hanging on. So I promised, I swore I would never do that again, and I hadn't, I swear. I'm not gonna give up on you, Ruth. Fuck me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I missed you. However... Just... ...Jaffa Cakes? I mean, Jesus Christ, woman, what the fuck is this, eh? Have some self-respect. And Vienetta. I mean, what is this, 1986? Fucking hell. You slipped up, that's all. We all do it. We're here to pick each other up when we fall. Just... Hang on. I'll get the stool. I'll get the stool... Mark! Stay down, stay down. Oh, god. Mummy! Oh, hey, baby. Hi! Mummy and Daddy are just having a huggle. Why didn't you come up and see me? I am so sorry, baby. Why don't you go upstairs and I'll be right there, OK? Is Daddy staying over? Um... maybe. Yes! Two minutes. OK. OK. Still got it... Look, I've got to go. If he wakes up, will you just tell him that I phoned? Yeah, I'll try again in the morning. I'm sorry. Love you, too. Hi. Oh, my god, you came! Yeah. I totally thought you bottled it. No. Sorry I'm late. Just had a bit of a day. Mel, this is Pin. Pin, this is Melody. Hey, Mel. She's my... BF's ex? Yeah. Yeah. She's tat-curious. Oh, my god, that is so cool. Yeah? Thank you. Pin, get me a needle. I'm gonna pierce your nose. What? No. No way. It's fine. It's temporary. If you don't like it, it'll heal. How do you even know that? Babe, look at me. What do you think? I don't know. Trust me. OK. Thank you, sir. OK. Very still. Alright? It's gonna sting a bit, but pain is growth and you can take it 'cause you're a fierce bitch. OK? OK. One, two... Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Work was insane today. So your work is more important than my time? Not more. I'd say they were healthy bedfellows. I've ordered. Oh, really? What am I having? I thought you didn't like that jacket. This jacket? Yeah, I think the word you used was 'basic'. Oh, I thought men enjoyed a bit of a basic bitch every now and then. Hmm. Thank you. I'll have a bottle of the Chateau Zaneuse, please. Um, Trump Towers over here seems to have ordered me a side. Can you bring me a ribeye? I'd like it to still be mooing. Don't do that. What? Don't embarrass me. Embarrass you? Are you serious? Ooh, look at that. Serious face. What the hell? You bore me. Do not do that again. I'm deadly serious. OK, OK. Gabriel, darling, we're done here. Sit down. I'm sorry if the world has never lived up to the love your mother heaped on you as a child, but I'm not prepared to be a recovery centre for your issues. Step into your power, Peewee, and stop trying to borrow mine. You see something shiny like this hot piece of ass right here and you want to possess it, don't you? Huh? Or break it. Ooh! Fix it. But a real man would just enjoy seeing himself reflected in the shiny. If you can't do that, it's probably best for everyone that you just leave it alone. Thanks for dinner. News just in. In an extraordinary turn of events, former colleagues of Warren Armitage have taken to social media in an unprecedented show of support for the veteran broadcaster. The hashtag 'NotMe' was trending this evening as female colleagues who worked with Warren over the course of his 40-year career spoke out to say that they've never experienced anything untoward during their time of knowing him, with some even going so far as to call the allegations blatantly false and ill-informed. In a world where we're used to seeing trial by social media, this is one of the first times we've seen such a unanimous defence of an individual. Alexa Wells is still yet to confirm or deny the rumours... Hi. Hi, Teddy. It's OK. Sh. Sh. What the hell? It's fine, go back to bed. Robyn, what are you doing? I'm fine. I'm-I'm-I'm fine. I got him. Give me Teddy. What do you think I'm gonna do with him? Robyn, please. He's fine. Just give him to me. Ruth! Come here. Baby, hi. Sh, sh, sh. What's happening? Oh, baby, don't worry about it. Just go back to sleep, OK, sweetie? Bye, Teddy. Get out of my house. I think you're overreacting. Get out of my house right now or I swear to god! You know the only reason you get to be as perfect as you are is because of me. I spent my whole life protecting you from things. Don't you blame your dysfunction on me. I choose to function. I never had a choice. Every day is a choice, but you choose to make an excuse. You choose to break things because you're angry. Well, guess what? We're all angry! Everything you have is because of me. Everything I have is in spite of you. You wouldn't even exist if it weren't for me. I held up the fucking sky for you, you selfish, spoilt, brat. You'd be fucking dust if it wasn't for me. You would be fucking dust! Get out! Get the fuck out of my house! Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. I just happened to be in the neighbourhood. I'm surprised you even remember what neighbourhood I live in. I need a place to stay. Are you fucking serious? Course you are. When else do I get to see you? Only when you need something. Do you have anything? Drugs? I'm on Adderall, prescription, but I've been cut off and the side effects are really hammering me. I think some coke would - would do it. Look, my purse was stolen. I have no money. I have nowhere else to go. I just need a few days to get my shit together and then I swear I will never ask you again. My, hasn't someone got themselves in a pickle? And what do I get out of this arrangement? What do you want? What have you got? Do you have anything here? Please just show me. Mm-mm. I've shown you mine. You show me yours. Warren Armitage is innocent. Danny Davis. It may have escaped your attention, babes, but I've already got Danny Davis. Not this, you don't. There's a kid. The sex worker in your video. She has a kid. It's his. Are you gonna stand there all night or shall I pour us a drink?
