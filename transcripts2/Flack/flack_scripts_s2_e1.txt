 Police! Stay where you are. Go, go, go! Don't move! Stand against the wall. Show me your hands. Oh, tits! Tits. Tits. Tits, tits, tits, tits. Titting tits! Oi! They're mine. Cocking cock sticks! They can't find me here. My wife. You've got to hide me. Hide you? This is serious, Cheryl. This could end my career. I could go to prison. Well, it's all relative, isn't it? I mean, let's not fall out over semantics. I'm going out the window.

 We're on the third floor. Son of a dirty barmaid, that's high. Police. Open up! What about the wardrobe? Why don't you close your eyes? Try hiding behind your fingers, see if that works. My god, your sarcasm is entirely uncalled for. Open the door or we'll knock it down. Phone! They're coming through! Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up! Hey, what's... Thank god. You've got to help me. I've been caught in a police raid in a - in a... Marcus, calm down. My career is on the line. My wife's gonna find out. OK, you have to listen to me. You need to find a hoodie or a jumper

 or something and cover your face. What? And do not say anything to anyone, OK? ...know it's me if I have a hoodie on! I'm calling your lawyer. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Why do you bother staying if you're gonna come in at that hour? Because I get to see you in the morning. Breathe. Really? Yeah, breathe. Nothing but toothpaste and coffee. What's this? Oh, it's nothing. Are you getting a job? Data analyst. That's actually perfect. You're great at analysing things. Please don't make fun of me. I know that you think that I can't do anything for myself but I... No, I'm being serious. I think it's great. I'm really proud of you. That's not patronising. You know how I mean it. You owe me money for groceries, and if you're going to drink all the good coffee, would you please get some more? Oh, I'm sorry. Mummy, I'm ready. Did you get ready for school all by yourself, my big girl? Did you put underwear on? Good. Ladies always wear panties. Don't tell her stuff like that. She's my child. I will tell her whatever I fucking want to. Mummy! I didn't say that. You did not hear me say that. Please don't tell anybody that I said that. Breakfast. What? Nothing. Teddy was up all night. I just - I need some sugar. What is that? Adderall. I have a prescription. For what? ADHD. Helps me focus. Oh, do you have ADHD now? A doctor gave it to me. OK. Robyn, you know the deal. You cannot stay here if you're not sober. I know the deal. Balls, he's early. Mummy! What? Nothing. OK, I need you to get ready for school, and please don't tell your father any of the things that you did not hear me say. Hi. Hey. You're early. Am I? Sorry. Just... keen bean. She's still having breakfast. Right. Can I come in? I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? Rob's here. Still? Well, as long as my mortgage payments aren't going to waste. Mark, don't be a prick. You've forgiven her, then. No, but she's my sister, so I don't have to. And your husband? I can choose you. I can't choose her. Daddy! Hello, darling. Are you excited about school? No. That's the spirit. See you later, baby. Have a good day. OK. Right. Right. You OK? It's hard. Don't. Don't - no, thank you. You're late. So are you. I'm the boss, I can't be late. Other people can only be early. Then I'm on time. So, how's... Caroline, I appreciate the concern, I really do, but just to reassure you, everything's fine. Good, good. I hear you and Eve are carving up your list. We're just finding that splitting up some of the clients helps with the workload. That's all it is. Look, I don't give a toddler's tear whose boyfriend you decide to put inside you, but if you choose to take a dump on the family dinner table, you must at least clean it up before the next course comes out. Check yourself before you wreck yourself, dear. Remember, a spiral looks the same from both ends. Caroline, um, there's someone in your o-office. Yes, I can see that. Thank you, Belle, that will be all. Ms Mills. Mr Paulson. To what do I owe this rare pleasure? Well, I was in town for 24 hours. I thought I would pop in and see my favourite ex-wife. It's not a crime, is it? Oh, my god. What are they feeding you? You know I look like an old testicle with a face drawn on it. You look better than the day we married. So, where are you taking me? Well, I thought initially perhaps here on the desk, and then after a quick nap to recover, perhaps over there on the sofa. What do you think? For lunch. Oh, of course. Where do you want to go? I'm not doing all the work. Oh! Oh, god, it's good to see you, Dimples. What! Um, there's a man. Oh, yes. This is the other little thing. Gabriel Cole. Pleasure to meet you, Caroline. I've heard so much about you. None of it good, I hope. Hmm-hmm! We were wondering if you would do us a wee favour. Who are you stalking? Christ. Sneak up on me like that again, I'll kick you so hard in the chick dick, you'll never ride a horse again. I'm sorry. I'm not interested in sorry, Gemma. That's not my name. Emma, Gemma, Nelson Mandela, Captain Cockermouth. Your name is what I say it is. I have been at my desk for 13 minutes and there's still no coffee in my mouth. That, for a start, is not good enough. Second, we were done with animal print about nine months ago. Did you not get the memo? You look like you're going to a 'Lion King' audition. That's not a compliment. And finally, you might want to consider a mattifying foundation before America invades your face and starts drilling. Here we go. That might be a new record. Where do they find these fucking snowflakes? Next time, can you at least wait until she's brought me my coffee? Any idea who the deep dish in Caroline's office is? What does he look like? Kind of grizzled, like if Philip Scofield got stuck on a desert island for eight weeks and had to kill a man. Sounds like Duncan Paulson. Paulson? As in the Paulson? I was starting to think he didn't exist. Oh, he exists. They used to be married. Oh, fuck off! How do I not know this? They set up the New York office together. He left his wife and kid for her. Apparently, she only agreed to marry him if he made her a partner and she got to put her name first. Oh, course she did. I'm wet just thinking about it. Sofi Adjani on line one. She sounds a little frantic. Aren't they supposed to be announcing today? What's she saying? I think 'canard' means duck. Duolingo. Sofi, it's Robyn. Slow down. What's up? You have to come and get me. What? You have to come and get me out, Flack. Out of where? I'm in fucking jail! Oh, Christ. Who's that? Eve, babe. Ciao-ciao. You're on speaker. Sofi, why are you in jail? I got into an argument with a connard stupide. Are you sure 'connard' means duck? These arseholes. I have a show this afternoon, so I need to get out. OK, we're on it. We need to figure out where she is and sort out bail. Are you coming? Caroline would like to see you both in the boardroom, now. I know. Cheap price... Robyn. How are you? How are you still employed? How are you still alive? You look good. You've got this whole 'professor who survived the zombie apocalypse' thing going on. Well, thank you. I was actually aiming for more retired assassin turned lighthouse keeper, pulled out for one last job. Well, now that you say that... OK, you two, enough flirting. Duncan, Gabriel, this is Eve. She's a double-barrel, but don't hold that against her. Pleasure. Eve, I've heard so much about you. Aren't you the one that pretended to be a champion show-jumper at Caroline's birthday party? Ahh, I'll admit that does sound like me. I once got so drunk I had a 30-minute conversation with Ellen DeGeneres - could have sworn she was William H Macy. I told her that 'Fargo' was my favourite film 12 times. Oh, forgive my rudeness. This is Gabriel Cole. I know who Gabriel Cole is. Pegasus Eco-Air. That's me. We have a mutual friend. Really, who's that? Melissa Young. Sorry. I meet a lot of people. Oh, yeah, I'm sure. Pegasus is the US's biggest aviation start-up. In 15 years, Pegasus plan to have electric aircraft running on all the major routes in Europe. Actually, I could get it done sooner but the aviation authorities can be real sticklers when it comes to things like health and safety regulations. Boo! Right? You can't make an omelette without downing a few 747s' worth of plebs. You're speaking my language. Look, I would love to stay, but I have to go. Sofi Adjani has been arrested. What for? She was in a fight. Possibly with a duck. Eugh, the French. Fine, go. Well, more important than me. I'm humbled. Well, I'll just have to leave you in Eve's capable hands. Lucky me. So, how can we help? OK. So, I made a couple of innocent little jokes on Twitter, and my shareholders, who clearly have no sense of humour, got a little bit spooked. What did the Tweets say? I said that Mark Zuckerberg Looked like a melted candle I always understood it wasn't libel if it was true. Also, the head of US air authority took great exception to your reference to te size of his hands. Again I refer you to my earlier answer. Look, we all know the dance. I say, "Daddy, Daddy, I've been a naughty little girl and I deserve" "a punishment," and they give me a spank on the ass and a filthy wink and we can all just get on to work like nothing ever happened. So, if you can just show me the slideshow, give me the badge or certificate, you'd be doing me a huge favour. What? Duncan and I have a lot to catch up on, so we'll leave you to it. Come on. Don't let him give you any shit. Do I look like a lady who'll take any shit? You most certainly do not. I like her. OK. Excellent. Well, why don't we start... Why don't we start with a drink? Wow, you have a lot of flavoured waters. Is there going to be a presentation? I'm sorry? Do you have a flip chart or something, you're gonna use? I wasn't going to use a flip chart, no. OK, great. Would you mind if we got out of here? I could really use a proper coffee, or a bloody Mary, or - ooh! One of those bubble teas. I... Come on, please. I spend my life in fucking boardrooms. Please, just take me for a cup of coffee. I will do whatever you ask. I promise. This is a message for Melody Bellway. Just confirming your job interview with Gwen at Pendall PR at 2pm today. We'll see you then. Melody. Melody! One capp and an oat latte. Uh, one black Americano and a flat white. But do you have cashew milk? Because I don't want any of that dusty oat crap. Eugh. Um, excuse me? Mm-hm? This is froth. It should be micro-foam. It's not 1985. Well, look who it is. Ahh. No, no, don't tell me, don't tell me. I'll get it in a minute. What are you doing here? Oh, you know, work. You? Work. Right. Yes, of course. It's ironic, really, considering coffee was never your strong point. So how... Sorry. How have you been. No, you. You go. I just - how's Robyn? She's... Robyn. You know, good old dead-eyed, tight-lipped, drown everyone around you in a black sea of self-involved, self-destructive self-pity Robyn. Jokes. We're fine. Mega-LOLs. Not one to fall out over a smelly old boy, of all things. And Tom? Fuck knows. Last I heard, he's off the wagon again, so he's probably up to his guts in gak and 22-year-olds. Good times. Oh, I've got a job interview. Pendall PR. They're looking for a new assistant. It's paid and everything. Good for you. And someone won't be going to that interview unless she gets her little Scottish arse into gear and makes me some coffee. Sorry. I better... Yeah, course. You do you. Nice to see you. Yeah. You made a friend. Yes. No. She used to work for me. OK, let's get on with this, shall we? You need to think of yourself as a brand, and your social media is your shop window, so if you want me in your shop, don't post a picture of your dick or your dinner. OK? Second... OK, I'm gonna stop your right there. Look, you are clearly exceptional at what you do, but I don't need any training. I said what I said intentionally to draw attention away from the fact that I was supposed to test-fly a brand-new prototype two weeks ago, and I can't get the damn thing's weight down enough to get it off the ground, let alone across the Channel. And, yes, I know the stock drops a couple of points every time the press calls me a loose cannon, you know? But that is nothing compared to how far it would drop if they started saying I can't deliver what I said I would. So I am here as a gesture of good will to the board. No offence. None taken. OK, great. Then how about I take you out to lunch? I find you incredibly attractive. You're not short on confidence, are you? Well, I do have a net worth of over $3 billion. Dollars or pounds? Pounds. So with the current exchange rate, that's, what, like, 300 euros? Come on, live a little. I say we cut class, smoke a joint, make out in the janitor's office. You seem to have confused a conversation with an industry professional with a romantic comedy from the early '90s. So why don't we just leave things there? Don't worry about the coffees, they're on me. Wait, I'm sorry. I know I'm being a douche. Well, as long as you know. Real talk? I work really hard, I spend my entire life swinging golf clubs, and dicks, with investors and board members, and actually, what I'd really like is just to have lunch with someone who doesn't give a crap about what I do, or what car I drive, or what watch I wear. Billionaire tech entrepreneur, philanthropist, Bugatti Chiron and FP Journe, FYI. Robyn. Oh. God, thank god you're here. Hey, Marcus. They are making me share a toilet. And there's a man with a tattoo of Cher on his neck who keeps asking me to play bridge with him. You've got to get me out of here. My wife still thinks that I'm in Hull reporting on the party conference. OK. Technically, I'm not here for you, but don't worry. I've called your lawyer and you should be out by end of play, so just be polite and avoid the showers. Do you want me to call your wife to come get you? No. No. No, no. I'll wait. Hey, stop swearing at everyone before they arrest you again. They don't understand what I'm fucking saying. You're all ignorant, you fucking English. I'm not English. Christ, my hair. God, I feel like I was a special guest at a piss party. So, are you gonna tell me what happened? Look, I was at a bar and some guy got fresh, so I decided to give him a little smack. You fractured his mandible. Really? You can't smoke here. Sorry. What did he actually do? He touched me. He touched you? Sure, or he said something. Look, I forget. What does it matter? Men are arseholes. We need an excuse now? We do when we fracture their mandibles. What is this mandible? It's the lower jawbone. Mandible? Mm-hm. I like it. Au revoir! Sofi. Oh, Sofi! This way. Thank you. Sofi! I don't want to talk about it. - It's aggravated assault. - Pass? This is my pass. Sorry. Look, nothing has appeared in the press yet, but the real problem is Kenrik. He's supposed to be announcing you as the face of the new campaign, and broken jawbones don't exactly scream 'Elegance'. I hate that fucking name anyway. It's so fucking pink. Look, I'm gonna try and make the charges go away, but you have got to keep your head down. Sofi! Where in Christ's tits have you been? Shelley, I've found her. Come on, let's get her done now, please. I am so sorry, my darling. My puppy was sick. Oh, Franco, baby girl, is he alright? He ate a tampon and it blew up in him like a puffer fish. He nearly suffocated, but he's fine now. OMFG. Well, you're here now. Come on, let's get you done anyway. Robyn, I'm loving those lines. They're great for you. Oh, thanks, Rick. Good luck with the show. Sofi. What? Could I have one more word with Sofi, please? It's about the dog. You have 30 seconds. Hm-hmm. Security camera. What? There was a security camera. Oh, I look terrible. See? He touched me. You bumped into him, and he still apologised. Oh! That's a hell of a punch. A hell of punch that's now breaking the internet. Ah, merde! My god, I have missed this place. Best falafel. Damian sends his love. He does. Are you still obsessed by the idea that he doesn't like you? He doesn't like me. But that's OK. I don't like him, either. Kidding. How's Bessie? Spectacular. The little one? Not so little, but majestic. Seeing anyone? I have... a few friends. What about you? I don't go hungry, put it that way. Do you want to take that? No. She's a big girl, she can figure it out herself. Now, have we accumulated the socially acceptable amount of small talk to go and have sex yet? Or do you want to chat about the fucking weather? Cheque, please. So, where'd you go to school? Downton Abbey? Ah-ha-ha, very good. Um, are you intimidated because I speak proper? Not at all. Us Americans, we don't care about class. No, you care about money. Ahh, right, the American dream. The more money you make, the better you are. Delightful simplification. Well, is it any worse than the more money your mummy and daddy inherited, or the more money their mummies and daddies inherited, the better you are? That is a system that literally promotes inbreeding. No wonder you all have such terrible teeth. Oh, so capitalism is the key to the all-American smile? Hey, in America, as long as you get shit done and you work hard enough, it doesn't matter who you are, you can make it. Unless you're black, or Mexican, or a woman. Touche. Let's play. Father, engineer. Mother, Eastern European. I'm thinking Balkan. Activist/life model. Father, lawyer. Mother, Northern European, well-kept, resentful alcoholic? So close. Actually, that's not fair. She had a law degree, but she sacrificed her glittering career for her grubby little children, as she so often reminds us. Poor Mummy, foregoing those 50-hour weeks and having to settle for private Pilates lessons and racially abusing the au pair. Too much? God, I never get to meet girls like you. It's always actresses and models. You know, they look great, but they also have this Melania Trump, dead behind the eyes thing going on. You know? You - you're mean. I love it. I'm very charming. I'm sorry, am I keeping you from something? Two secs. I've been calling you. I'm with Mr Cole. Someone leaked footage of Sofi's attack. Well, what do you want me to do about it? What does it show? I've sent it to you. It's bad. Britney with an umbrella bad? Solange in a lift bad. It's not pretty. OK, hold on. Christ. Hell of a punch. I need something, fast. Violence only plays well when it's for a noble cause. Can we feminise it? Hashtag No Touching? The guy looks like he brews ethical craft ales for a living. He hardly screams toxic masculinity. OK, well, if it's not sexism, we need another ism. Race? Sofi's not a Muslim, is she? There. What? A witness. Must be those guys. Who are you talking to? No-one. 01:48, the two men watching on - can we use them? OK, we can use this. I'm going to pay Dorothy96 a visit. Text me the address and I'll meet you there. OK. Where are you going? Business. I'm business. No, you're not. Ooh, does that mean I'm pleasure? You wish. Can I see you again? I'll think about it. It's good to see you. Thank you. Make sure you give her a good tip. I'll tip you what you earn in a week if you give me her number. Oh, my god! Melody. You were utterly incredible, Mills. Having said that, there was a moment there when I thought I might be having a heart attack. There are worse ways to go. Could be an inconvenience, though, couldn't it? Especially for you. So, what do you really want to talk to me about? Oh, god. Am I really that transparent? Babysitting brat boy billionaires isn't usually your bag, baby, so... No. ..what's going on? You want to sell up, don't you? What's wrong? Knocked up some Russian? No, it's not about the company. It's not that. What was that for? I just wanted one last one that wasn't clouded with pity. What are you talking about? Um... I have blood cancer. I have about six weeks, if that. You look fine. I'm not fine. I don't... It's done. There's no treatment. There's no options. It is what it is. And, to be honest, I'd prefer not to talk it to death. Oh. Just need to tidy up a few things and do it with a modicum of dignity, best I can. I'm sorry, I didn't know how to tell you. So you fucked me. The last thing I wanted was a charity shag. Nothing sadder than that. At least you'll die handsome. The lawyers will tie up all the business stuff. It's not complicated. Have you told Elizabeth? No. I'm seeing her next. Don't imagine that meeting will be quite as good as this one. Not all ex-wives are created equal. Never was a truer word said. And I really should shower. Flying to New York tonight and I should catch her before I go. You can't stay? I can't think of a better way to leave you. In fact, I will always remember you like this. Naked, in a hastily booked hotel room. The scene of some of our greatest adventures. I can't argue with that. You are a classy bitch, Mills. Dorothy96? Sorry, who are you? My name's Robyn. I work for MPPR. I'd like to talk to you about the video of you watching Sofi Adjani breaking a man's jaw. Well, how did you know... Here's a tip. Don't use the same handle across all internet platforms. Also, do not buy that vintage '70s sideboard you're currently watching on eBay. It's not real vintage. You need to be looking for teak or rosewood. And if you ask me, I'd pay the extra money and go Danish. We did see it. Bloody vicious, it was. She really went for him. That bitch is fierce. Stu loves her. Nearly pissed his knickers when he saw her. I did not. I had to stand in front of her like a muppet just so you could get a sneaky pic. You wanted that picture for your Instagram. Did I? You did. You had a filter on and everything. Boys. We need - Sofi needs a favour. From us? How would you like front-row seats at Kenrik's London show? Hello? Hi. Is that Melody Bellway? Speaking. Hi, Melody. It's Gwen from Pendall's PR firm. You're scheduled for an interview with us this afternoon? Yeah, that's right. I just wanted to let you know that, unfortunately, we're going to have to cancel the interview. Um, OK. Can I ask why? Look, Melody, strictly between us, I contacted MPPR for a reference. Right. And I have to be honest, it wasn't good. Was... Was that Robyn? 'Cause there's a... We had 900 applications for this job. Maybe you're better taking MPPR off your CV. OK. Thank you. Bye. Hi! I'm hungry. Bye, darling. Love you. OK, bit of homework. Apparently, she has to draw an animal that would have been on Noah's Ark. Obviously, I told her that Noah's Ark didn't really exist, and she said she knew that but that her teacher would 'bust her balls' if she didn't do it, so... OK, got it. Um, look, Mark, can I ask you a question? Course. OK. In Microsoft Office, how do you put in those columns without making the writing all weird? OK. What, you're just doing a bit of casual spreadsheeting, are you? I'm actually trying to make a CV, but I feel like I haven't used a computer for anything other than online shopping since grade school, so... You're looking for a job? Is that a problem? No, no, I just didn't... Doing what? Why is it so hard for everyone to imagine me doing something for myself? It's not, it's not. I'm sorry. I think it's a great idea. Actually, I was talking to one of the other mums at school, and she's doing a few days a week as a TA. I mean, that's decent hours. You'd be amazing at that. So, as a way of getting a break from spending every waking hour looking after our children, you think that I should get a job looking after other people's children? No, I... Because obviously, the only thing that dummy mummy Ruth can do is look after children. Is that... OK, Ruth. You know what? It is always a pleasure, Mark. Yeah, you... Cocks! Mummy, when's Daddy coming home? Um, I don't know, babe. He might not be. Why? Well, because daddies don't always live at home. But we still love you just as much, and you're gonna see him all the time, I promise. Do you have a daddy? Um, yeah. His name is Jared and he lives in America in a place called Philadelphia, and he stopped living in my home when I was a teenager because he and Granny Clara had a big falling out. Can we go see him? Babe, um, Mummy has some work to do. Why don't you go upstairs and check your fairy door, huh? She can't go out there. Sorry, Sofi, you know I love you, but she's supposed to be the face of the new campaign. Rick. Elegance. Elegance. What's elegant about this? She looks like Tyson fucking Fury. It's a stupid name anyway. Why Elegance? You're not even French. There's French Algerian on my mother's side. C'est pretentieux. Sofi. Not helping. I can't deal with this right now. I've got a show starting in less than 30 minutes. Sorry we're late. I had to sell a tit to get these two through security. Who the fuck are they? OK, Ricky, you need to chill your boots and listen to me. With the greatest of respect, Sofi's right - Elegance is a shitty name. It's 2020, bae. Women don't want to be elegant. They want to be strong, they want to be badass. They want to be warriors. Fuck yes, we do. Rick, this is Simon and Stu. They're the innocent gay couple from the video. Now, what you can't hear is that they're being verbally abused. They were? We were. It was awful, honestly. Do you know what our Sofi, our little, elegant Sofi did? She stood up for them because no-one else would. I... I did. She stood up to a bully, a man twice her size, and she knocked him the fuck out! Do you know why? She's a warrior. Guerriere. That, I like. Now, tell me that's not the sort of woman you want representing your brand. All sorted? Guerriere is live. Hey, Mike. How are you? Well, I'm just about as happy as a pig in shit. What can I get for you, baba? Just the usual, please. Was that last lot the same? It doesn't seem to be working as well. Well, you're probably building up a tolerance. Get it all from the same place. Dr Dick. Writes me prescriptions in return for favours. Man has a terrible opium habit, which I actually quite admire because you don't really see it much these days. Yeah, he functions at 11 all week and then just disappears off the face of the Earth for two days straight. It's incredible, really. Oh, word of advice, mind. If you do have any cataract surgery, you might want to avoid West London Hospital. There you go. All there. Count them if you like. No, I trust you. Have you got any Ambien? Got some benzos. They'll knock you right out. No. Oh, I can't tempt you with a little bit of Charlie, can I? Just got this killer shipment in from Colombia. Still got the cartel stamp on it. It is proper mint. No, I'm good. Well, thanks for coming. Always a pleasure, never a chore. Melody. You'll be fine. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. I just wanted to say thank you for today. God, don't be silly. Hardly did anything. How'd the interview go? It didn't. Robyn told them not to hire me. Why would she do that? There's no point trying to figure out why that girl does what she does. It's a losing battle. You choose to have her in your life, or you don't. Look, how do you feel about working for MPPR? I don't understand. I was fired. That was as an intern. I'm talking about as an assistant. My assistant, in fact. You're getting an assistant? I mean, yes, I would love to, so much. When's the interview? That was it. So, do you want it or not? What about Robyn? Caroline? I cleared up Caroline earlier. Told it was you who saved our bacon on the Sofi thing. She said it was fine, as long as you stop dressing like Dora the Explorer. Oh, my god, thank you so much. I promise I will not let you down. We should go for a drink. We should celebrate. Right, sounds excellent. However, I have a billionaire taking me up the Shard tonight. Might even go for dinner, too. Someone must have slipped him my number. Mmm, this needs doing. Dry-clean only. You shrink it, you buy it. There's a peach. OK. Hey, babe. It's Gwen. Thanks for sending over that reference about Melody. Sounds like we dodged a bullet. Thanks for the heads up. See you soon. Bye. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I just happened to be in the neighbourhood. How you doing? I'm good. Yeah? Yeah. Good. I saw on Instagram that you and Ravi took a trip. What were you doing on my Instagram? Nothing. I was just... I just never got round to unfollowing you. Is that a problem? No, I just don't know how helpful it is, that's all. For you or for me? What do you want, Rob? I'm - I'm pregnant. How - how - are you sure? Oh, my days. Oh. I don't... What, is it even mine? I don't know. Does Tom know? I haven't... Just go home, Rob. Sam. No, what do you want from me? I'm sober. I don't believe you. I don't believe anything that comes out of your mouth. Look, I'm at work, OK? This is my work. Please, can you leave? Look, I... Rob, leave. Now, please.
