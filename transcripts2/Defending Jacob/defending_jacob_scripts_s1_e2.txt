 So don't wanna go for my run. We need to talk. One. Two. Three! What? You wanna tell us what this is? You were snooping in my room? I was. Not your mother. That's not the point. It's just something I got. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal?

 Then why didn't you tell us? I only hid it because I knew you'd freak out. You got that part right. Did you buy it online? No, at the army-navy store in town. I paid for it, by the way, with my own money. I'm just saying. When was this? I don't know. Couple months ago. Ever bring it to school? Just once, to show some people. Who? Derek, Dylan. I was just like, "Hey, check this out." Have you ever used it?

 Like for what? For whatever you use a knife for. You read Derek's post, didn't you? - Why would he write that? - 'Cause he's an asshole. That's why. You didn't answer my question. Have you ever used it? Like to stab somebody? No. How could you even ask me that? Because I have to. Because I have to know with absolute certainty that this isn't the knife they're looking for. - Well? - Andy, he just told you. Can't believe this, that you even think that about me. - Of course we don't. - Yeah, whatever. Hey, hey. Look, we believe every word you've said. We just wanna know why Derek wrote what he wrote. We thought he was your friend. He is. - It's not a big deal. - Not a big deal? Jake, he accused you of murder in a public forum. No one means what they say on there. That's what kids do, they just talk shit and they try to sound cool. That's all it is. So you're not at all bothered by what he wrote? I mean... Yes, I am, a little bit, but he was just being a dick. No one takes it seriously. Honest. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the knife, okay? Can I have it back now? That's not even remotely funny. Well... I bought it. It's mine. Not anymore. I'm gonna be late for school. Well, I can drive you, if you wanna wait a few. No, it's fine. I'll walk. What time will you be home? I don't know. I might stay for math. Come here. I love you, okay? Love you too. Hey. I shouldn't have yelled. God. Fucking Derek. What kind of idiot writes that online? So what do we do now? Do we need to report it? No. God, no. What's to report? It's just he's been accused and we know about it. It's not like the police aren't going to find out anyway. - It's right there online. - It's not a credible accusation. There's no reason to bring the whole world down on Jacob's head. Trust me, it's better just to let this go. What do we do with it? I don't know. I'll put it somewhere. Are you sure? Honey, it's not a crime to own a knife or to be a stupid teenager. Thank God. We'd have to lock up half of 'em. And here you go. Hi. - Can I help you? - I certainly hope so. And she wanted this item we didn't have. So I try to explain that we don't have it. But she was supposed to get it, so she starts flipping out. And then she started yelling at me, throwing a tantrum. I was, like, getting nervous. 'Cause she was coming at my neck, so then eventually I called the security. Guard came, tackled her right down. Since when do we even have security? Turns out we do. And they're pretty good as well. I'm sure it is. Leonard Patz. Detective Peterson. Newton Police Department. I'd like to ask you some questions, sir. - Hey. - Hey. I can't stop thinking about it. I have to assume that every kid in school has seen those posts. Their parents too, probably. Cara gave me this look this morning when I came in. Her daughter's a sophomore at the high school. Honey, if people wanna gossip, they're gonna gossip. It doesn't mean anything. - I was thinking I should call Dina. - Who? Dina Yoo. Maybe she has some insight into what's going on with the boys. At the very least I could ask her to talk to Derek. Tell him not to post any more of these reckless comments. I think that's a mistake. My gut says that if Jacob's not upset by it, then... He says he wasn't upset. That doesn't mean he isn't. Honey, I got to jump off. I'm at the station. There may have been a break in the case. - Really? - Yeah, there's a guy we like for it. The cops just picked him up, so I got to get in there. Okay. I hope it's something. You'll call me later? Of course. Bye. Bye. Same kind of kid you showed interest in before. - Morning. - Hey, morning. How's it going? Well, they got him to admit to being in the park the morning of. And that's it so far. - What, you got him in the broom closet? - It's the remodel. The interrogation room is the only room we don't use that much. Is my lawyer here yet? You said my lawyer was coming. She's on her way. Look, I never hurt anyone, okay? - Just look at my file. You'll see. - This has nothing to do with your file. We're just trying to get a clear picture of what happened in the park. You can understand why we'd be curious. Same kind of kid you went after last time. Same type. I'm not feeling very well. You want something from the machines? No, thank you. We're pissing in the wind. - How long you been at him? - Almost an hour now. Good, let him sit. Get him thinking. We don't have that kind of time. His lawyer's on the way. This is what I was worried about. - Take another run at him. - Andy. Tell him you found the knife. See if that gets you anything. What? I don't think he's our guy. I can't pin it down. It's just a hunch. I'm on the fence, but I'm not feeling it either. This is our only lead. I'm getting pressure from my office, from the community. You don't think I'm feeling it too? It's all I hear about. - If you want us to try again... - I do. You're the boss. I have a headache. Can I please go? Leonard, we're trying to exclude you here. We wanna rule you out. Okay. Well, I told you. I was in the park because I walk there every morning. And I was nowhere near where the kid got killed. I never go that way. Ever. I mean, I don't even know who the kid is. You know, I've never seen him. Never heard of him. You know. What about the knife? What knife? Do you own a knife? I mean, yeah, I have some for cooking. How many would you say? - Did you say 207? - Yeah, that's right. Okay. Thank you. I don't know. Andy, don't tell me this stunt was your doing. Joanna. Patz is yours? No. I'm just covering for a friend. May I see Mr. Patz, please? He's only here as a potential witness, not a suspect. Right, and I just got drafted by the Celtics. You need to come clean. You got a real class act here. You read his file? I tell you, I don't know how you guys do it sometimes. Now that is a shame, because you would be good at it. Trust me on this. Of course, you'll switch off the camera and the microphone. Yeah, of course. We'll give you another room, if you want one. That's not necessary. We won't be here long. Besides, I trust ya. Enough to let me keep questioning him? No. I trust you too much for that. Detectives. Mr. Patz, I'm Joanna Klein. You're my lawyer? Just for today. Ms. Cronin is stuck in court. She asked me to fill in for her. Okay. The final answer is therefore 5X. - Did you see what he wrote? - I can't... If you have 2X... Derek is always saying shit. Attention, please. This is a reminder to those students who have signed up to help the police search Cold Spring Park. We will be gathering in the lower gymnasium at 2:45 this afternoon and walking to the park as a group. - Sorry, sorry. My bad. - My fault. All right, I'll see you. I... I think you should know Derek's been saying some shit about you. Like, really bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw what he said online. Not just that stuff he said online. There's other things too. Sarah! Sarah! We should maybe talk later, okay? Yeah. All right. Did you get the Global assignment? I missed this morning for the stupid orthodontist. Yeah, sure. Please report to the group leaders you've been assigned to. If you do not have an assignment, the tables back here have volunteers. They will be happy to assign a group leader to you. Again, please report to the group you've been assigned to. If you do not have an assignment, the volunteers at any of these tables can assign a group leader to you. Mr. Barber. Any luck so far? No, not yet, but we still got a couple hours of daylight left. Okay if I hang back here? Sure, wherever you want. Half the town came out to the park to search for the missing knife. You didn't take part in that search, did you? I did not. Why was that? Prosecutor never takes part in a search like that, and you know it. You run the risk of becoming a witness in your own case. Or could it be that you knew that the knife that they were searching for had already been found and disposed of? Jesus Christ, you got to be kidding me. What is this, Perry Mason? Did you or did you not find a knife in your son's room? You know I did. Jacob told the detectives that himself. And where is that knife now? - Getting in the weeds here, Neal. - Let me worry about the weeds, Andy. Jacob's knife was never found. What happened to it? Andy? - I threw it away. - You mean you got rid of it. No, I mean I threw it away. The same way any parent would. But you weren't just any parent. I was protecting him from his own stupidity. I was being a father. You mean to tell me that you aren't the least bit troubled by your actions? Even now, after everything that's happened? No. It was the wrong knife. But how could you possibly know that? You never turned it in for forensic testing, for blood or fiber traces. I didn't need testing. I knew my son. That's it? That's your justification? "I knew my son"? I knew my son. Dispatch, this is 1-Baker-1. - Thanks, Dave. - You bet. We've got two units heading to the corner. You want them posted up there, correct? That's correct, 1-Baker-1. ...624. We're at Beechwood Road. We've got that area covered. Dan? Someone told me they saw you. What the hell are you doing here? Where else would I be? I told him. I said I want another DA. Someone who's not just gonna sit on his hands. Dan, I don't know what I've done to upset you. It doesn't matter. They're taking you off the case. Excuse me? You don't believe me? Call your boss. Go ahead. You talked to Lynn? You're out, Andy. Thank fucking God. Dan. Dan! Lynn Canavan's office. - It's Andy Barber. - Yes. Just a minute. - Hello, Andy. - Lynn, hi. Listen, I... I need you to come down here right away. Is something wrong? Just come back to the office. Okay? Please. We need to talk face-to-face. Yeah, okay. Copy that. Mr. Barber. DA asked us to escort you in. - You serious? - Yeah. Jesus Christ. - How you doing, Kingston? - Hanging in there, Mr. Barber. You good? I don't think so, no. Did you really need all this, Lynn? What do you think I'm gonna do, jump out the window? It's simply protocol. - Are you firing me? - Nobody's getting fired. You know Reiko Ishida from public affairs. Mr. Barber. Have a seat, Andy. We have some bad news on the Rifkin case. The print we lifted from the victim's sweatshirt... it's from your son. Wait. What? It's a match for his right forefinger. From the angle, they think maybe he reached over and grabbed the victim by his sweatshirt, leaving a print on the tag. - There's got to be an explanation. - I'm sure there is. They go to the same school. Jacob's in his class. Yes, we know that. - This doesn't mean anything. - We know, Andy. Have you arrested him? - Lynn, have you arrested my son? - Not yet, no. But you're going to? We have no choice given the circumstances. - Do you have a warrant? - We are getting it now. Lynn, I give you my word, he'll turn himself in. You don't have to arrest him. He doesn't belong in jail. Not even for one night. He's not a flight risk. He's my son. Please, don't arrest him. - Andy... - Please! It's not even a close call. You know that. Why? Because of a fingerprint? One fingerprint? You need to get a lawyer for Jacob. You're ruining his life, do you know that? You're gonna destroy it. I'm following the evidence. That's my job. Look, I have to view him as I would any other suspect or it will reek of preferential treatment. This decision has been made, Andy. Wait, wait, wait. What about Leonard Patz? We just started looking into him. Talk to Pam Duffy. She can explain. We did. There is more going on here than you're aware of. More than what? A fingerprint? Tell me, goddamn it! Sorry. Hey. That was... I'm asking you as a favor to me and my family. Please don't do this. We're putting you on paid leave, effective immediately. What am I supposed to tell Laurie? Andy, I'm sorry. I'm begging you. Look, I need you to listen to me. We all care about you. I care very much. Whatever it is your son may have done, I'm here to help you navigate that, all right? Andy? Andy? Who gets this case? Neal. Are we done here? Jacob, it's Dad. I need to know where you are. Call me as soon as you get this. Green light. Red light. You go back. You go back. Come on, Laurie. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Green light. Red light. Come on, Laurie. Pick up the phone. Hi. You've reached Laurie Barber. Goddamn it. Green light. Red light. You all got me! Okay. Go back. Go back. Oh, okay. Would you take over? - Laurie. - What's wrong? Is Jacob okay? He's fine. I just need you to come home right now. I can explain everything when you get there. No, tell me now. Just please come home. Duffy's on her way there and she has a search warrant. - I just want to try and get there before... - A search warrant? Oh, my God. This is about the knife, isn't it? No. That... Just come home right now. I can explain everything. I promise. Okay. Oh, my God. Mr. Barber! Sir! You know the house is frozen. You got a warrant yet? Yeah, I didn't think so. It's my house. I have a right to go inside. Andy! I'm really sorry, Andy. Is Jacob here? I don't think so. Any idea where he would be? Have you tried his phone? He must have turned it off. You probably know that by now. Listen, I'm gonna need you to wait outside. You know the drill. Don't fuck this up, Pam. I mean it. Do your job. I won't. Sir. What is happening? Where's Jake? I don't know who else to call. He'll turn up. I'm sure he's just scared. I threw it away. The knife. His knife. What? Why would you do that? You wanted to keep it in the house? Oh, my God. You knew this would happen, didn't you? That Jacob was a suspect. No. No, I was as blindsided as you were. I just wanted it out of the house. I didn't know any of this would happen. Okay. I think we're all done. Laurie. Any word from Jacob? We've called everyone. We have state and local looking for him. He must be hiding. Do you know that for certain? No. I guess he just saw the police outside and got scared. Why would he assume that they were here for him? We're not answering any more questions tonight, and that includes Jacob when he shows up. I don't want anyone grilling him. He's a minor, he has a right to a parent present. So don't try to pull anything. Jeez, Andy, nobody's gonna do anything without you there. I know. I know. Just... don't. It could help him. Come on. Who are you talking to? I really am sorry about all this. I know you are. Okay, well, I'm gonna go wait out front. Just so you know, they may have found the knife. Really? Where? Not sure. I just found out. He didn't do this, Pam. I know you and I aren't gonna talk much after this, so I just wanted you to hear it from me. He didn't do this. I'll keep you informed. A lot of people are looking for you, you know. I didn't do it. Do what? Kill him. I didn't... I just found him. He was just lying there on the ground and... I thought maybe he was hurt or something, so I went to help... to pick him up. Then... I saw the blood on him and I saw that his eyes were open, and I knew that he was dead. So I got scared and I ran. Did you tell anyone? Why not? Okay. Well, I'm gonna take you down to the police station now. I want my dad. Please, I really want my dad. What are you thinking? Nothing. Don't. Don't you dare shut me out. Not now. Whatever worst-case scenarios you're considering, I need to know what we're dealing with here. I don't know what we're dealing with yet. I'm just thinking about Jacob. Oh, my God. Are you all right? Hey. They really think I killed Ben. It's a mistake. We're gonna figure it out. Don't worry. How is this even happening? I don't know. I don't know, but we're gonna clear it up. Sweetheart, we know you're scared. We all are. They said I can't go home. No, not tonight. But there's gonna be an arraignment first thing in the morning. - I don't even know what that is. - It's just a proceeding. They're gonna read the charge, they're gonna set the bail, then we'll take you right home. Are you sure? Absolutely. You'll be home by dinner. I give you my word. How much is bail? I don't know. We'll find that out tomorrow. What if we can't afford it? What happens to me then? - We'll find the money. It's okay. - We have savings. The house... - Yeah, but what if... - Hey. Hey, let us worry about that. Okay? I'm so... I'm so sorry. I didn't... I didn't do it. I swear. I didn't do it. We believe you. I'm not... I know I'm not, like, the perfect kid or anything, but I didn't do it. You are perfect, sweetheart. I didn't even know Ben. He was just, like, this kid from school. Why would I kill him? Why? Why would they think that? Is it because of what Derek said? - I don't know. - What do you mean? This is your case. Jake, did you tell the arresting officer that you found Ben's body? Is that true? And you didn't tell us? Honey, how could you not tell us that? I didn't tell anybody. I thought, you know... that I'd get blamed for it. I know that was really dumb of me. I know that. I wish I had. I just... I got scared and now... Mom, please don't cry. Jake, I need you to listen to me very carefully, okay? Don't say anything to anybody else about this. Do you understand what I'm saying? That's very important. - Yes. - I mean it. Not one word. When we get home, we can talk about all of this, but until then, you don't... You're leaving? They're not gonna let you stay? We're gonna meet you at the courthouse first thing in the morning. - We'll have a lawyer. We'll have... - Why can't you be my lawyer? No, I can't. Why not? I want you. I can't for a number of reasons. It's a bad idea. Okay. I... We love you so much. You know that? You know how much we love you? I know. Be strong, okay, buddy? Hi, guys. So I know I haven't posted in a while, but... It's been a rough time lately, and I just... I guess I was in the mood, so... This is a song my dad used to sing to me. It's been in my head today, so... Feel free to comment if you like it. Or don't. Or whatever. Everything is cool Everything's okay But just before last Christmas My baby went away Across the sea to an island We have made an arrest. While the bridges brightly burn We believe the person responsible for Ben's death is his classmate Jacob Barber. So far away from my land The valley of the unconcerned I was walking down the road, man Hello. What? Just staring at my shoes When God sent me an angel Just to chase away my blues Saw a hundred thousand blackbirds Just flying through the sky And they seemed to form a teardrop From a black-haired angel's eye That tear fell all around me And it washed my sins away Now everything is cool Everything's okay Now everything is cool Everything's... Laurie. What? What? Nothing. I'm sorry. My head's all over the place. We should try and get some sleep. Get you anything else? I'm okay. Thank you. Just so you know, we're closing soon.
