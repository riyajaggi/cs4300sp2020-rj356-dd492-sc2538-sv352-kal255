 Melrose Place (2009–2010): Season 1, Episode 6 - Shoreline - full transcript 
 Anton V, a famous fashion designer, meets Riley and decides she must be the face of his new Denim Jeans campaign despite Ella's chagrin. Meanwhile, Jonah is excited about the job offer where he gets to direct another music video, as he's run into financial issues. But Riley goes behind his back and turns down the gig. At Coal, David meets with Amir to discuss another posh art piece, and Amir sets David up to meet a well-connected cousin of his on a luxurious yacht. Wendi sends Lauren on another job where "anything goes" for another wealthy client. But Lauren panics when she begins to board the same yacht David is already on. Also, Violet feigns an illness to orchestrate a meeting with Michael at the hospital as part of her wickedly twisted plan to exact revenge for the way he treated Sydney.

 Previously on Melrose Place: Jonah, you are a hugely talented filmmaker. And I'm not just saying that because I'm your publicist, manager and agent. Ella has a thing for you. You think she's pushing your career out of the goodness of her heart? Rotations start next week, and I'm still a little concerned about your finances. You sure you can work that out? I can work it out. I didn't peg you as someone who wanted to pursue this line of work on a regular basis.

 Will you give me a chance? What's a rich boy like you doing this stuff for anyway? Look, I need cash, okay? Bring me something I can move. If you were happy, you wouldn't have called me. You definitely wouldn't have been sleeping with me. It was a mistake. You're my mom. Violet, listen to me. I never had a baby. Don't do this to me. Oh, my God. Sydney. David. You scared me. The door was open. What are you doing in Auggie's apartment? Oh, uh, Auggie's surfing in Cabo.

 I'm just picking him mail up for him, watering the herb garden... In his bedroom? Yeah, uh, I was just looking for the plant food he told me about. It's in the kitchen. I usually take care of Auggie's place when he's out of town. I guess this time he asked me. Look, if you don't believe me, you can call him and ask him. "Dear Auggie. You won't talk to me, won't let me explain why I fell apart. It's my ex-husband. I thought this time he'd choose me, but one woman's never enough for him. Even after 16 years, Michael brings out my worst demons. All I can do is numb myself. Love, Sydney." Oh, my God! My daughter can't breathe! She's in respiratory distress! We need to do something now. Have you got an ABG? It's been drawn. On her way. Okay. Where's the on call? O2 sat levels are falling. Left-to-right shunting, decrease in the ventilation-perfusion ratio. Okay, get the CPAP, go! What's the status? Hypoxemia. Possible pulmonary edema. It's okay, sweetheart. You're going to be okay. Nice work. Long hours must be paying off. Thanks, Doctor. Mm. There's nowhere I'd rather be. How's David? I haven't heard from him lately. He must be as busy as you. He seems fine. Um, I only see him in the courtyard every now and then, but I'm happy to tell him "hey" next time if you'd like. Okay. Keep up the good work. Hey, Wendi. So, you're going to be going to a party tonight. Intimate, elite and very discreet. The client's going to love you. He has very sophisticated taste. Okay. Sophisticated is good. And you're going to be working with a group of my best girls. When you say "a group" is that, like, we're each going to be assigned to a specific guy or...? Lauren, if you have a versatility issue, I can call somebody else. No versatility issues here. Count me in. This is good. This is sexy. You're really going to like this. My new line, Real Denim by Anton V uses certified organic cotton, non-toxic dyes... and equally important... the pockets are specifically designed to flatter the ass of every woman from every angle. That's good, Anton. Just keep going just like that. Aren't you late for your power cocktails with the velvet mafia pre-Laker game? Oh, I got a half hour and a vested interest in women's trendy denim. Or more like a vested interest in what's under Anton's hemp boxer-briefs. Hot, talented, successful... He's more than mere hookup material. I'd date him. That is so cute. So, how's the press kit coming along? No! Jonah, we need to see the details, okay?! Oh, yes. I can do that. Go. I'll take care of this. That's fine. Done. I mean, you don't want to be sober for tip-off. Ella, keep Anton happy. Oh, and, uh... find out if he's dating anybody. Ooh, I like it. I get you gigs, you exceed all expectations, and we both come off like superstars. Don't mess with the system. Look, El, I'm sorry. The focus was off when I zoomed in on one of the buttonholes. The focus or your focus? I saw you yawning in between takes. Was there a Tarantino marathon last night? No, no. I was up late redesigning my Web site. I'm just trying to get some cash flowing here. El, it's bad. Like, I don't have a thing lined up after this gig. And you can't be my only source of employment. Yeah, you're right. But today is all about my high-maintenance client, and my boss' personal agenda. Okay? Great. I got the lens I need. It's somewhere. Okay, you would not believe my day. Hey, Riles... a sharing issue at the crafts' table left me and my favorite dress covered in paint. Can you bring my diopter? I can't get any extreme close-ups without it. Is it okay if I leave in 15? Riles, I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't urgent. I'll be there as soon as I can. Beautiful. It's a Kazimuri. From a collector in Santa Monica. Got lost on its way to the Guggenheim in Bilbao. You, uh, know anyone who wants to give it a home? I mean, you pick up a watch or jewelry, I'm your guy. But like that Vachon painting, this is out of my league. You got to go through my cousin, Hassan, with that stuff. He's hooked into the art world? Art, antiquities... When can I meet him? Tonight. I'll set it up. If I fence through your cousin, what's in it for you? He's family. Unlike whatever's going on with you and your father, my people look out for each other. Good. If Hassan can look out for me, then consider me family, too. Excuse me? What? Who are you? I went to Emergency. They said it was going to take hours. I... I saw your name by the elevator. You're the head cardiologist, right? Right. I'm sorry, I'm just so scared... I don't know who you are, but this is not the way things work around here... Please, I... I feel like I'm dying. My heart, it feels like it's going to jump right out of my chest. Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35 www.addic7ed.com All right, Ms. Foster. Please unbutton so I can take a listen. It's Violet. Is it bad? Well, your heart rate is definitely elevated, but I don't hear anything else unusual. Do you have a family history of heart disease? Maybe. I was adopted. Well, I don't think it's anything serious, but we should definitely run some tests. Tests? You know what? I'm feeling better already. Do you drink a lot of caffeine? 'Cause sometimes that can cause a racing heartbeat. Oh, my God. Yes. This morning, I had, like, four energy drinks. Well, there you go. That's probably all it is, because... you look like a very healthy young woman. Do you have medical insurance? You know, I just started a new job, so... Well, why don't we consider this visit off the books? That was so sweet of you. Thank you so much. You know, you should come by Coal. I'm a bartender. Oh, I bet you pour a mean cocktail. I'll buy you a drink to repay you. You don't have to do that. Please. I want to. Heading out after a shift on the Mancini team? I thought the old man took pride in running his protégé into the ground. He said to say "hey," by the way. Yeah? Well, you tell him I said "hi" back. So, dress plus makeup equals date? Am I right? Hmm? Whatever. Same guy from the Nightingale party? No. Just, um... some other guy. Oh. Can you help me with this button, please? Uh-huh. There you go. Do I look all right? Not bad. You clean up good, Doc. Have fun. You, too. This is fabulous. Do you see that zipper? Recycled copper. Would you get a close-up of that, please? Um, okay, I just... I want to stay wide for one more sec. I don't have a sec, Jonah. Caleb. Hi. Yes, everything is going well. Anton could not be happier. Unclench and let me do my job. Excuse me, this is a... It's a private showroom. I'm sorry to interrupt. No, Anton. She's cool. She's with me. Of course. Okay, I did not know which one the diopter was, so I just brought them all. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Fiancee of the year. You deserve the biggest trophy in the world. Oh. Yeah, well, I'll trade that trophy for a shoulder massage when you get home. When that bell rang, I literally ran from the building. Why? What happened? Um, well, for starters, I'm a total failure as a reptile wrangler. Hard Hat Bob went Shawshank? Who's Hard Hat Bob? A turtle. He broke out of a maximum-security terrarium. Behind those beady little eyes is the pea-sized brain of a mastermind. And now he's at large in my classroom. You have a classroom? I teach first grade. Of course you do. You into fashion? I couldn't even tell you what brand of dress I'm wearing right now. As long as the pattern hides paint and puke, works for me. And story time's over. Time for the grown-ups to get back to work now. So, Anton, do you like live music? Because Caleb has tickets to the Greek Theater, and they are... It's genius. Really? You don't even want to know who the band is? That girl right there. She's beautiful. She's grounded. So real. She's perfect. For what, monitoring a playground? No. She's perfect for the face of my new campaign. You're not kidding. God, I love yachts. Makes me feel like I'm in the South of France. This doesn't look like the South of France to me. We can pretend, right? It's what we do. If, uh, this doesn't work, I've got a little helper in my handbag you can take to calm those nerves. It's that obvious, huh? That you're new, it's your first party, and you're freaking out? Honey, on nights like this, it's best to just... go with the flow. What does that mean exactly? Anything can happen. Sometimes the guys like to keep things one-on-one, other times they like to watch us together. Okay. Don't worry. I'll look out for you. Thank you. Hey. Hey. I told Ella not to pull you out of the game. Oh, please. At WPK, clients come before Kobe. And it's preseason, right? Yeah. You a basketball fan? I think once they finally trade Sasha, the Lakers will be the best team in the league. I agree. Yeah. Oh, good. You two should definitely swap stats later. Look, can we just focus on the fashion emergency here? Maybe Caleb can weigh in on the Riley of it all? Right, right. Riley Richmond. What's the deal? When I saw her, something just clicked, all right? I've been selling Real Denim using fake people. Hey, models are real people, too. These... They... they seems so... so wrong. All right, they're not authentic. I want to try something new. Real people wearing Real Denim by Anton V. So, you want to abandon your entire campaign? Well, I like the instinct. A lot. The press will eat it up. We can make that happen. Fantastic. So, I will see you tomorrow? Sounds good. All right. And if I hurry, I'll still make the third quarter. Um, Caleb, we're publicists. It's our job to protect Anton's image. This epiphany he's having could destroy it, and his brand. I think he's on to something here. Riley is not a model. She a first grade teacher. Yeah, that's Anton's favorite part. Okay, I understand that he may have been charmed when she skipped in here all rumpled and rosy, but she is a novice. Hiring her for a national campaign is a huge mistake. Oh, come on. The wholesome teacher persona gives us a great angle to play. Have her here first thing tomorrow morning. Look. There's a doctor in the house. I happened to be in the area, so I thought I'd stop by for that drink after all. After a long day at the hospital, you definitely deserve one. Hmm. How many lives did you save today? Oh, three. You must be starving. The nectarine burrata salad is my favorite. Oh, but the foie gras. I'm going to get you both. You know, you really don't need to do that. A drink is fine. You took care of me earlier. Now I'm gonna take care of you. I could attempt to warm up these samosas. Why did you buy them again? Oh, that was when I thought we should maybe hit Goa on our honeymoon, but now I'm thinking maybe, uh, Big Sur. Really? Is it as romantic? Oh, my gosh, it'll be even more romantic. The rugged California coastline, and scenic hikes, and sunsets. Time to celebrate with the official beverage of models everywhere. Celebrate what? Fashion debut of Riley Richmond. Anton V wants you to model for his new line. What? Okay, I've had a really long day, and I'm not in the mood to be mocked. I... am as serious as a shoe sale at Barney's. I don't understand. Anton knows I'm not a model. And that is exactly why he wants you. Oh, my... Riles, this is, like, more than amazing. No. No, you know I hate being the center of attention. Public speaking gives me hives. I always had to be in the chorus in school plays. And besides you, the only people I'm comfortable standing up in front of are six-year-olds. Riley, this is every girl's dream come true. Yeah, well, you want to make my dreams come true? Reinstate the arts programs at my school. Okay, you will be shot by a world-class photographer, hair and makeup done by the best artists in the business. Your face will be on national magazines. Oh, my... I mean, I would so buy out the entire newsstand. Fittings start tomorrow. No, I don't know. I'm sorry. What's not to know? It's, like, five days of work, and I'll ballpark it around ten grand. Whoa! What?! $10,000?! Oh, yeah. This is the real deal, people. Riley, come on. It's better than handing out juice boxes at the day care center. I teach first grade. And what you are asking me to do means taking a whole week off work. My class has tests, projects, trips planned. I mean, those kids spend more time with me than they do with their parents. They depend on me showing up. Kids are resilient. They'll get over it. Yeah, I mean, little tykes are... they're tough. Huh? See? Even the groom-to-be thinks you should do it. Right, Jonah? What? No, I think you would make an amazing model. Amazing. But it's definitely... it's your choice. Guys, the answer is no. W... Honestly, Riley? This is so selfish. So who are these guys? Another tip: that's a question you're never supposed to ask. Meaning I don't want to know? From what I've overheard, they run some kind of import-exports thing, and I'm pretty sure it's not legal. Then again, neither is what we do. Hey, I'm here for Hassan. How you doing? Right this way. You must be David. I'm Hassan. Amir tells me you're quite the, uh, art aficionado. He says the same about you. You should, uh, get yourself a drink. Thank you. Get to know the girls. Come here, come here, come here, come here. Oh, look who's getting into the spirit of the evening. Just between you and me, I've, uh, never gone pro. Well, consider tonight my gift to you. Now, what's your type? I have to get off this boat. Why? That guy's my neighbor. Don't... don't look! The blonde. Leather jacket. He can't know I'm here. Well, why don't you find yourself a girl, and have some fun? You realize Wendi will seriously lose it if you bail? Staying's not an option. Okay? I'll deal with Wendi. I need you to help me. Please? Okay, okay. Hey, come here. Excuse me. To new friends. What was that? Our best anejo. Okay. I am not letting you take all these drinks out of your paycheck. Ah, no, I told you. Here. Come on. On the house. I'm taking care of you. All right, as long as later, you'll let me take care of you with a very big tip. Excuse me. Hi, honey. Hi. I know, I should've called. Noah is out of control. Noah! Yeah, the new girl is not exactly working out, and Leticia is going to be in Ecuador for another week. Well, I put a call into Larchmont Staffing for temp sitters today. I hear music. Where are you? At that Italian place across the street. It's Rob's birthday. Babe, look, surgery's one thing, okay, but a party? Come home. I need help. Uh, all right. I'm on my way. I invented a drink just for you. The M.D., because after you drink it, you're gonna need one. Oh, no. You gotta go, huh? Yeah. And I'm really sorry, Violet, because, um... I had a really great time. Okay, so you said "surprise me." I rose to the occasion: the pineapple/peanut butter combo. Could be genius. Could be deadly. Um, I just checked my messages and there was one from the property management company. Our rent check bounced. Actually, your rent check bounced. There's money in the account. I deposited the check from the Weisburg bris last week. Hmm. There must be a glitch or something, I don't know. It was a week ago. It should have cleared. Don't worry about it. It's all good. I'll, uh, call the bank up tomorrow and clear it up. But don't tell me this doesn't look delicious. Do you want to cuddle and watch a movie? I think Princess Bride's on cable. I wish. I can't. I've got to finish editing Anton's opus. I told him I'd deliver it tomorrow. Okay. Mmm, pineapple-PB? Genius. So good. Hi. Hi. It's my responsibility as a bartender to make sure you're okay to drive. And I take my job very seriously. Then I guess I could use a little fresh air. Wow. I've never seen a car like this before. I might be crazy, but I think there's something you've been wanting to do all night. Oh, really? What would that be? You're a doctor. Now, make me feel better. So, you think you can line up a buyer for the sculpture? Forget the sculpture. Let's talk about the Egyptian antiquity that came into the cit valued at $2.2 million. It's at a home in Bel Air. And since Amir tells me you're the best, I want you to bring it to me. It sounds like a great opportunity, but I work alone. Oh, a small, yet independent businessman. That's nice. People don't usually turn me down. It's nothing personal. There's just too many things that can go wrong. I need to be the one in control. You show up tonight. You ate my food, enjoyed my women, and then you turn down. Hey, you invited me. My offer to do business? I draw the line at playing fetch. Amir told me you were be stubborn, but he failed to mention you were stupid. I guess we're going to have to teach you a lesson. Get the hell out of my way. Hey! Whoa! You, my friend, need to learn some respect. David? Hey. What happened? I, uh... I borrowed a buddy of mine's bike, took it up Angel's Crest and spun it out. I must've hit my head. Hmm. Passed out. Let me look at it. Lauren, I'm fine. No, you're not. Labored breathing can mean internal bleeding, plus a possible concussion. You need to go to a hospital. I'm-I'm gonna sleep it off. No. You're not slipping into a coma on my watch. I'm taking you to a hospital. It's all there, $5,500. There you go. Uh, hi. You're, uh, turning into a majorly fast runner. What's the money for? The EX3. Sweet deal. Thanks, buddy. You're selling your camera? Yeah. I, uh, I put it on Craigslist last night. But you need that for work. You love that camera. Okay, thanks, dude. No, no. I don't know, I don't know what's going on here, but this is not for sale. What? I... I just drove all the way from Alta Dena. Well, I'm really sorry. What are you doing? Okay, what was that all about? It's just that camera's almost a year old. I just figured I sell it and get a new one, you know? You got to keep up with the latest technologies. Jonah... the truth? The truth is that my bank account is dwindling rapidly. And pretty soon, I'm going to be in some real trouble. What? How is that possible? I mean, people a cutting back and they're recording things themselves. I mean, yeah, I've been working. I've had to cut my rates, though, like a lot, just to even get the jobs. So, that EX3, that could get me through the next couple of months. If we need the money... No, no. This is... it's my problem to fix, okay? I mean, I'm trying to be this guy with a job and steady money and... I had a plan, okay? This great plan. It's just not panning out the way I thought it would. Okay, this might come as a shocker, but I'm not marrying you for your money. Jonah, if you have a problem I want to know about it. Always. Okay. I just... I... I thought could fix things and come up with this brilliant plan. Hey. We'll come up with a brilliant plan. Together. Okay? Okay. Hope that text about the school teacher was some kind of joke. Ah, like you wearing your shades in the office. I need something to shield me from those Paul Smith pastels. And, yes, Riley Richmond turned us down. Oh, no-no-no. Don't put you off night on WPK. She turned you down. So you're going to tell the client. You do realize I got five messages from Anton V? Oh, he's got big plans for Riley Richmond wearing his Real Denim. Crushing his dreams-- not exactly the opening I had in mind. Okay, look. I have my feelers out to some incredibly attractive, interesting... real people. We'll make sure Anton forgets all about that boring public schoolteacher. Hi, Ella. Hi. Uh, who's this? Riley Richmond I hope I'm not too late. Is the modeling job still available? What the hell happened to you? I tripped. Right. What did you do, get caught going after another painting? Right over here. I ordered the X-rays. It's not as zippy as a motorcycle, but it's safer. You got to be kidding me. It's house rules. Come on. Hop in. Come on. I'll walk. You know I expect full disclosure from all members of my team. Mm-hmm. So, you want to tell me what went on last night? I don't have any details. He was in pretty bad shape when I found him... When you find out the truth, you come straight to me. I'm worried about my son. Of course, Dr. Mancini. Ella, you're the best. Thank you for bringing me the perfect girl. If imakes you happy, Anton, it makes me happy. Here it is. The Anton V electronic press kit. Let the denim revolution begin. Nice. Oh, my God. You're really doing this? And this is getting little I'm going to go grab a latte. After much mulling, self-scrutiny, and practice posing in front the bathroom mirror... I decided to give this a try. What about your... your cla and the tests and... and the trips? They're in good hands with Mr. Hammock. I just hope they don't forget all about me. Impossible. Wait, Riles, are... are you okay with this? No, this is our life, Jonah. And it's real. There are going to be rough patches. We're in it together now. Look, I-I... I called all the leads I had this morning. I'm going to drum some business if it kills me. I'm not worried. It's only a matter of time before Hollywood comes calling for Jonah Miller. But you never need to hide things from me. No matter what it is, I can handle it. I know you can. And... you look unbelievable in these jeans. Really Yeah. Oh... Anton, good news. I got Lifetime, Bravo and the Style Network chomping at the bit. I owe it all to WPK. Seriously, man it's been great working with people who support my vision. Yeah. And, uh... I think we should celebrate. Dinner this evening? I got a standing reservation at Church & Stat Great. I'm craving the steak tartare already. Me, too. I've seen a lot of motorcycle crash victims. Theirs skin usually looks like hamburger. Your injuries are completely inconsistent with your story, David, so you want to tell me what actually happened last night. Look, I told you I didn't need to come to the hospital, all right? So stop with the interrogation. Well, you're lucky I took X-rays, because you have a fractured rib. David, I'm only asking you so I can give you proper medical care. I got in a fight. With who? Just... just a guy. It was an ugly situation. Mm-hmm. Look, not all of us can be out there acing exams and saving lives like the perfect Lauren Yung, all right? I'll be back in a minute to tape up your rib. Wendi, I am so sorry about last night. Lauren, I didn't call to hear excuses. Then how about the truth? My neighbor was on that boat. I couldn't let him find out about me. The same thing happened to me once. I was in a hotel bar with a client, and in walks my straighter than straight roommate. What'd you do? I walked right up to her, told her I was on a date with a college professor. Finished my drin then finished my job, because I'm not a quitter. I didn't quit. You took the easy way out. Wendi, I've never taken the easy way out in my life. If I thought you wer lying to me, I'd have fired you. But I'm going to give you another chance. You owe me, and, Lauren... I never forget a debt. Hi Hey. Oh, you look exhausted. Yeah. I can't believe they called you in for a bypass last night. Where's Noah? Oh, he's in with a babysitte I'm interviewing. You found someone? Well, she registered at the Larchmont Agency this morning. I'm just interviewing her right now, but, um, I think she migh be perfect. What the hell are you doing in my house? Relax. I don't want the nanny job. The minute I saw the way you looked at me in your office, I knew you were your own worst enemy. My mother was right. What the hell are you talking about? I told you I was adopted. And when I found my real mom, she was a mess, all because of you. I never got a chance to know my mother because what you did to her. Your mother? What was she, a patient? My mom was Sydney Andrews. I know you don't think I'm your father, so what do you want from me? You hurt my mother. She was trying to get better, but you wouldn't let her. And now, you're going to pay. Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35 www.addic7ed.com
