Nature Cat: Oh, he's so cute. Daisy: So adorable. Hal: Oh, can we keep him? Huh, huh, can we, please? NATURE CAT: Aah! Oh! Just when you thought Sir Galahad couldn't get any cuter... Hal: He got cuter! So, so much cuter. NATURE CAT: Ooh! (Tittering and speaking gibberish) Squeeks: Hey, you guys, you got to try a hickory nut. It's... (Gasping) ...delicious. Who is that? Nature Cat: Squeeks, this is Sir Galahad. Sir Galahad, this is Squeeks. Squeeks: Nice to meet you. (Laughing) Sir Galahad: The pleasure is all mine. What do you say you let me out from this cage so I can properly say hello? Squeeks: Um...okay. (Laughing) Yes! Wait, Hal, he's not allowed out. Oh my hamster honour, I will come out for a brief moment, and then scoot back in. I promise. ALL: Okay! Hal, we need to be responsible. We're pet-sitting Sir Galahad. Remember the rules Dad told the kids? You're not, under any circumstances, allowed to let Sir Galahad out of the cage, or you'll be in big trouble. (Loud thudding) Whoops, how did that happen? Oh, Daisy, if I let rules dictate my life, I would not have seen the magnificent ruins of Machu Picchu, smelled the sweet aroma of the Amazonian rain forest lily, or kissed the dainty hand of a beautiful, fair maiden. (Kissing) And this is where I say... Yes? ...so long, toots! Thanks for the nuts. (Laughing) I'm never going back into that cage. (Laughing) ♪ Baby, I was born to run ♪ What just happened? Sir Galahad got away. I told you we shouldn't let him out. No! Come back, mi amore. Hey! Oh, I don't see him anywhere. My love. Where is he? Where Galahad go? We need to find Sir Galahad before our family gets home, or we're going to be in huge trouble. What do we do? What do we do? What do we going to do? Seriously, what do we going to do? Sir Galahad 's gone AWOL. We do what we do for any escapee, any cage breaker, any rogue rodent. We track them down and bring them back. Hmm, no animal tracks. Daisy, what do you hear? A few butterflies fluttering near Foley's pond. A snoring raccoon over in the old tree stump. But other than that, nada. No sight, no sound. (Gasping) How about smell? Release the hound! (Mumbling) Uh, hey, Hal? Buddy? You're the hound. Pick up that hamster scent! Oh, me? Righto! (Sniffing) Found him. Nice work, Hal. Thank you. Ah-ha! Furry. A bit squishy. I've got him! HAL: Mr. Chewinski? (Squeaking) Oh, I thought I lost you and now I found you, and now I'm happy! Whoa! Uh, how are we going to find Sir Galahad now? Oh, brother. (Toy squeaking) Hey, look at the signs Hal left. His fur, and trampled grass. These tell us Hal was here. Wouldn't Sir Galahad leave signs to show where he's been? Yes. Hmm. Oh, huh! Interesting. Hamsters like to gnaw on things to keep their teeth from growing too much. Oh, we could look for chewed sticks. Yeah. Oh, let's see. What else. Oh, we could look for hair. What colour is Sir Galahad 's hair? Gorgeous. It's brown. We can look for brown hair patches. What else? Dreamy eyes, beautiful teeth, bad-boy image. Hamsters need to drink water, and they eat seeds and nuts. Oh, hello there. Nuts. Oh, wait, Sir Galahad was eating those. (Sniffing and gasping) It's his. Galahad was here. (Camera shutters clicking) HAL: Hey, guys! Look what I found. What is that? (Toy squeaking) Oh, I apologize sir. What "we" found. You guys, I know this trial. Mice and squirrels use this all the time to get through the woods. Do you think Sir Galahad would follow this trail instead of making a new one? He sure would. And look, he did. Time to find that crooked critter, that villainous vomit, that-- Uh, Nature Cat? We really should get moving here. No, wait, wait, wait. One more. That wrongdoing rodent. Oh, that's a good one. Worth the wait. Onward and yonward! Nature Cat: (Laughing) We're on the right path. (Squeeks Stomach growling) Squeeks: I'm so hungry. I wish I had one of those nuts right now. Well, if Sir Galahad hadn't stolen your hickory nuts, you would. You guys, Sir Galahad didn't steal them. He certainly did. Look. So long, toots.  Thanks for the nuts. Well, you don't know Sir Galahad like I do. Halt! Which way did he go? Which way did he go? Signs, signs. Look for signs. Hey, wait. What do you think? (Gasping) It's Sir Galahad 's. I'd know that beautiful brown hair anywhere. Oh where, oh where is my brave hamster now? That's exactly what we're going to find out, Squeeks. We're coming for you, Galahad. Onward and yonward! (Sniffing) Nature Cat! More signs. We're still hot on Galahad 's trail. (Laughing) He will rue the day he lied to us. Sir Galahad didn't lie to us, Nature Cat. Oh, he certainly did. Look. On my hamster honour, I will come out  for a brief moment, and then scoot back in. I promise. Technology. All signs point this way. We're getting closer and closer. I can feel it. Huh? We've hit a dead end. No more signs. And no Sir Galahad. No! I know you're safe, because you're so brave and smart... and cute. And I still miss you so. (Lips smacking) You know where Galahad is, don't you? How could I know where he is? Why are you protecting him? I have no idea where he is. Yes, you do. No, I don't. Yes, you do. No, I don't. Yes, you do. No, I don't! No, you don't. Yes, I do! No, you don't. No, you don't. Yes, I do! I do! At least I think I do. And you're right. Sir Galahad did lie to us to get out of the cage. He did take my food. Now I see who Sir Galahad really is. He is not a good hamster! No, he's not, Squeeks. And we need to bring him to justice. Help us bring him to justice. Well... all animals need water. He's probably thirsty right now. I know I am. Water? That's it! Hey, is there any water around here? (Squeaking) What's that, Mr. Chewinski? (Squeaking) There's a creek that way? Then that's where we go! Tallyho! You did the right thing, Squeeks. Let's catch that hamster! Keep your eyes peeled for signs of Sir Galahad. Look, you guys. Hamsters love to gnaw. These are his teeth marks. He's here. Great work, Squeeks. Look, more chewed sticks. Wait, I hear him. Over there. Bingo. Hold it right there, Galahad. (Spitting) Huh? The jig's up, pal. You're going back to the cage. Never! ♪ Baby, I was born to run ♪ Whoa! Help! Help! I mean, I wasn't born to swim! (Sighing) Water. Why did it have to be water? (Whimpering) Help me! Reach out farther, Mr. Chewinski. I got him, I got him. I don't got him. Squeeks! (Sir Galahad sobbing) So scary! So-- So-- So-- So scary. Oh, oh, don't let go. Hold me. (Sobbing) And this goes as a lesson for all rule-breakers out there. Crime does not pay. Squeeks, listen to me. Squeeks, I-- I love you. You got to be kidding. Mr. Chewinski, this is on you, buddy. Watch him. But, baby, I was born to run. Yeah? Then turn around, toots. (Laughing) I'm running! (Laughing) I told you I was born to run. That was really nice of you, Squeeks, putting the wheel in there. Ah, well, what can I say? I'm a nice mouse. You sure are, Squeeks. You sure are. (Narrator reading onscreen text) NATURE CAT: The moon, a mere 238,855 miles away from where I stand right now. A cat has never walked on the moon. But I intend to change all that, for I, Nature Cat, will boldly go where no cat has gone before: to the moon! (Crickets chirping) So who's with me? Oh, oh, oh! I'm so in! Explore the moon? Come on, you guys. (Gasping) Wait, isn't the moon made of cheese? Moon cheese! Oh, baby, I'm in. Uh, I certainly can't commit until I hear how you're planning on getting to the moon. Oh, that minor detail? Ha-ha! Observe. Ta-da! Ready for blastoff, Captain. Moon cheese! Here we go. Counting down. ALL: Three, two, one... Uh, guys? This is not going to end well. ALL: Blastoff! Onward and yonward! Look out, moon, here we-- (All crashing) Uh, hello, moon creature. We come in peace. Come on, I'll show you how to get to the moon. Ooh, nanu-nanu. This rocket ship is how we're going to get to the moon. ALL: Ooh. Yes, yes, yes. I must say, amazing work, Daisy. Thanks. Oh, look. The sun's setting, so the moon's going to rise soon. We've got to blast off when the moon is right in front of us, so we know where to aim. Guys, we gotta move! We gotta move! Yahoo! To the moon! Uh, Hal, this is just a drawing of the rocket ship we're going to build. This can't fly us. Oh, interesting. And besides, what you're doing there is impossible. Oh. (Grunting) Let's build a rocket ship. Tallyho! Hello. (Panting) (Exclaiming) ♪ (Whistling) I, uh, meant to do that. Good work, everyone. Now that's what I call a rocket ship. ALL: To the moon! NARRATOR:  You say you're going  on a moon adventure, hmm? Well, be ready, because  the moon is very different than here on Earth. The moon is like a vast,  empty desert without any water  to drink. (Laughing) Whoa, that sure is dry. And you better  bring air to breathe, because there's no air  on the moon. There's less gravity  on the moon than on Earth. On the moon, you would weigh  about one-fifth of what you weigh on Earth. Less gravity pull  means more bouncing when walking on the moon. (Laughing):  How about that? See? The moon is very different from here. So we have to make sure we have everything we need to survive on the moon. Okay, let's see here. Air? Air. Check. And, uh, water? Water. Check. How about food? Food? Check. Food? Check. And don't forget about all the delicious moon cheese dishes we can make. Oh, mac and moon cheese, moon cheese pizza, grilled moon cheese sandwiches, moon cheese fondue, moon cheese fricassee, moon cheese flambé, moon cheese au gratin. Moon cheese! So, is there anything else we need? Ah, just a few things from home. (Toys squeaking) You might want to pack a little lighter, Hal. Okay. HOUSTON: Uh, Daisy, ma'am? A moment. This is Houston. He's going to monitor us and man mission control from here. It is an honour to be a part of this mission. Great to have you, Houston. So, is our flight plan set? All set, ma'am. Just waiting for a confirmed visual of the moon. (Howling) Next time I'm howling on the moon. There's your visual, Houston. Copy that, ma'am. It's go time! ♪ (Squeaking) Mission control. Come in, mission control. Over. This is mission control. All clear for liftoff. Over. I jus want to say there's no one else I'd rather go to the moon with. Now, let's make history. HOUSTON:  Countdown for liftoff. ALL: Five, four, three, two, one. Blastoff! We have liftoff. Stand by. Exiting Earth's atmosphere. Hey, what's the blue marble way back there? (Gasping) It's Earth. Wow! I live there. Man, oh, man. Take a look at this. ALL: The moon! Whoa! I can't wait to be the first cat to walk on the moon. I can't wait to howl on the moon. I can't wait to find some moon rocks. I can't wait for the moon cheese fritters, the moon cheese melba, moon cheese cacciatore, the moon cheese empanadas! Moon cheese! (Loud crashing) (All gasping) What was that? Daisy. Oh, no. Houston, we have a problem. Ma'am, you have a big problem. Your booster has become  disengaged. (All gasping) Repeat: your booster  has become disengaged. You only have seconds  to fix it, ma'am, or else. We need someone to go out there and reattach the booster now. Nothing will stop me from being the first cat on the moon. I'll do it. Ready, Nature Cat? I was born ready. Wait, not yet! Hold it, no. Okay, sorry. Just a deep breath. Jitters. Okay, and now I'm rea-- I am not. Oh, wow. Ooh, deep breath. Okay, almost. Here we go. And shoulders back, and-- No, no, no, no! Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Ready, I think. Here we go. Uh... Tallyho. Whoa. Oh, no! Steady, Nature Cat. Steady. Ah. (Humming) Whoops. Almost lost the screwdriver. (Laughing) That would not be good. Yikes! The rocket booster! Oh, no! ALL: Nature Cat! I'm pretty sure this is not good. Yup, this is not good. At all. Quick, the hose. ♪ (All grunting) Ow. But just as planned. Way to go, brave boy! Ha-ha! Oh, well, yes. Just remind me to never do that again. DAISY: Ready for moon landing. Okay, stay frosty, Daisy. Stay Frosty. HOUSTON:  In three, two, one. And we're landing. ALL: We did it! One small step for cats, one giant leap for felinekind! (Laughing) I'm on the moon. I'm a cat on the moon! Tallyho! (Howling) Moon cheese! Man, oh man. Check out this moon rock. (Gasping) I'm going to get the cheese. Moon cheese! Wait a minute. What kind of cheese is this? (Sniffing) This is dry dust and rocks. (Sighing) Oh, man, looks like no moon cheese for me. NATURE CAT: Say cheese. Cheese! Oh, Nature Cat, thank you so much. Now let's have some fun on the moon. (Laughing) SQUEEKS: Yeah, way to go. (Giggling) ANNOUNCER:  Nature Cat, Squeeks,  Daisy and Hal are cartoon characters  and not real animals. To keep all of our animal  friends safe, check with a grown-up before you bring a pet  on your next nature adventure. Whoa! Ah-ha! ♪
