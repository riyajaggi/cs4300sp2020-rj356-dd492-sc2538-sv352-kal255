 Still Game (2002–…): Season 2, Episode 4 - Brief - full transcript 
 Victor feels the need to get away from it all and when he hears that Danny's wife is selling Danny's old car, he jumps at the chance to buy it, even though it involves having to outbid Manky Frankie and, at the end of the day, is not quite the bargain he had hoped that it would be.
