And be careful with that Rita girl, - I warned you already! - Okay. And stop buying these expensive sneakers and do something for your mother for a change. Hey Luana, all good? Let's meet in the park later today. I'll get it with a friend, but this is the last time, okay? Talk to you later. Nando, if you don't want to come with me to the block party, I'll go with the girls. Yeah, then all the dudes will say my girl was at the block party? Not to mention your girls will be all chasing dick. They'll be chasing dick, not me. Besides, when was the last time you took me out to the mall? - Scheyla, I can't be hanging around. - Why not? Damn, you ask a lot of questions, worse than a cop. Don't talk to me like that. I'm top secret. I can't be taking risks. Forgive me, Godfather! That's right. That's why you're with me. - Come on! - Right, baby girl? Your boss doesn't even know your name. I don't care. Soon everybody will know my name. José Inácio, please proceed to office number seven. Hey, there. - What's up, girl? - You good? Hey! What's with the hair? - Enough of straightening it. - I dig it. I dig the new shoes, too. Looks cool. Did you hear it? Oh, girl... Don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't do. You know what's best for you. It's easy for you to say. What's the big deal? You gotta go after your independence. - Hey. - Hey, good afternoon. Otherwise, you'll be asking for permission forever. Have mercy! The time is now, sis. Let's go. Can I go peddling with you? Of course you can. Your mom already hates me anyway. Yeah! But this is no cakewalk, you have to bust your ass. I'll meet you by the barbershop, - Okay? - Sure. - She's tired. - Hey, Nando. What's up, bro? - What's up? - I need to talk you. Can you arrange something for me? Like a quick fix to make my day? Come with me. He'll be back soon. - Are you fucking crazy? - Why, bro? I'm with my family. Show some respect. Isn't it what you do? You're a user, right? You know where to find it. Get out of here! Go! What's the matter? It's none of your business. Fuck off! She audaciously goes on shaking She goes on sitting She goes on thrusting - What's up? - Hey, Rita. All good, Formiga? - Fine, and you? - Good. - What's new? - I came to get that stuff. - The stuff, right? - Yeah. - This shit's great. - Good shit? Sure. Hey, this isn't on the cuff. Don't get me wrong. I'll deliver first, then settle it. Hey, Rita, when will you give me some sugar? I'm always around. That's the one. There. Fucking brat. Are you by yourselves? Damn, the dude is late again! Juninho fired him. Goddamn it... - Thank you. - See you. Hey. Look at the time, Doni! Sorry. Go refill the stock. Where were you? Doing a school project, but the bus back took two hours. Fine. Let it go then, I'll do it myself later. Let me help you, then we can have lunch together. All right. Oh, take these with you, please. Son! No funk in the store. Some customers don't like it. Texting at the table? What's up, MC Doni? This is Denise from Funkbeat. We heard the song you sent to us and... You're good, man. We're going to be at the block party. Show up so we can talk, all right? Son. Son. Drop the phone and eat. What? School stuff. Hey, my man. - Hey, bro. - All good? - Are you good? - What's up?

Bro, same wave. We should stick together. Same wave? All of a sudden you're a fucking drug lord, is that it? Hell, no. I'm just doing what I think is fair and right... Dude, hear me out. You're greedy. Just play it cool with that anxiety, because greedy eyes don't stand a chance here. Dawg, this shit's really good. Bro, this is imported stuff. Straight from Spain. Even those far from the stage will see it. You bet, but my song needs 10 million plays so I can pay for all this. Now I'm tight with the dudes at Funkbeat, so I'll pay. Do you think it's that easy, bro? Hey, and them sharp bougie labels? Do you have some? Man, drop by my crib. My cousin sells those. Hey, guys. What's up? Hey, bro. All good? - I'll drop by then. - Hey. Yeah, I'll do that. - What's up? - Hey. All good? What the hell? Got into college? Yes, I got in with flying colors. Joking... - Remember the song I sent you? - Yeah. The guys from Funkbeat heard it and asked me to show up at the block party to talk. No shit? - For real. - Doni, don't rush things, bro. Because these guys like to talk a lot. Drop it, Rivaldo! - Come on! - Drop what, man? We'll get to the block party with a Mr. Nobody and walk out with a Funkbeat MC, motherfuckers!
