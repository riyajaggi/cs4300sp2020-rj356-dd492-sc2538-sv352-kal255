 Thank you. It's better that no one knows she's here. May God be with you. Do you think she'll be okay? Yeah. We'll come back to pick her up later. What about Dondoka? And my song? Sometimes it seems like you're not even listening. We're not gonna scare anyone. How will I get her respect? You don't go and get respect, you have to earn it. Don't get all worked up. We do what's right. Some doors you can't knock on. You have to kick them in. Yeah, sure.

 I'll get my song back. Shit! The police are here! - Goddamn it. - Fuck. - What's up, bro? - Calm down, Doni. I should've taken the side streets. Are you insane? Get out! - No way. - Get the fuck out! And leave you here? Give me that! Fuck! Give me the gun! - Hi. Let me help you. - Oh, my child. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Already up? There's soap in there. I can help with the bandages. I made a custard. It's good. These donations came in. Take whatever you like. Thank you. But I'm leaving. Your friends told me what happened. I will sort it out. You can stay here if you want to. I have to go home. I have to get my merch, all my stuff... - Eat something. - Can I use your phone? I've gotta call Nando. I need to see what happened to my friend Cacau. The inspector took her to the police station. She had marijuana in her bag. Fucking hell. Fucking hell! Goddamn it. Fuck. Can you lend me your phone, please? They took her to juvie. Cacau's been arrested, Rita. Goddamn it. Fuck! I can't believe it! There is nothing we can do but trust God. I'm not waiting. Thanks, Sueli. - Have you got drugs in your car? - No. Pereira, check this one out, please. - Have you got a record? - No. - What do you do? - Sales. You won't find anything. If I want, I'll find it. One more word and I'll arrest you for disrespect. One of our people was killed. Do you know anything? - What are you looking at? - Nothing. I have an appointment. My wife and daughter are waiting for me. You'd better cancel it. No registration, and this attitude. Let's go for a ride. - I'm not going. I didn't do anything. - Stop arguing. Let's go! Get in. - Where are you going? - I won't sit and wait for a miracle. Rita, you are not okay. - Come on, stay here. - Pastor, help me! He's possessed. Calm down. What's going on? - He's crazy. - Fátima, let's go home. - Take the evil spirit out of him. - The family is part of God's plan. Let's pray for Him to rid you of the evil spirit that's tormenting you. He's wrong. You're wrong! But it's written: The wife must obey her husband as she obeys the Lord. What's there to pray for? - This guy hit her. - Rita! - It's a police case. - My wife is my business. She's staying for a while. She doesn't need you to look after her. And one more thing. If you lay another finger on her, you'll regret it. I'm warning you. Juninho! What's up man? Are you crazy? We're closed. There's police everywhere. Get out! - They've caught Nando! - What? - During a traffic stop, they took Nando. - Go home! Go home! Hello? Boss? Boss, Nando was arrested. Nando was arrested. - Juninho! - Go away! If you hear about Nando, let me know. - See you. - Márcia, if we don't help Nando, we'll be next. We'll go down with him. Where were you? - Donizete! - Calm down, Chico. Donizete! - What are you hiding? - Nothing. The cops got Nando. God almighty! Right. Thank you. He's giving a statement with the other boys. There's nothing to do now. Jesus! Does Scheyla know? Were you with him? Where were you? Just driving around. Did you do anything wrong? Rita got in a fight and we helped her. I don't want you on the street. - I want you straight home from school. - What do you mean straight home? Donizete! Do as your father says. My car was clean, but your partner didn't let me go. I need to get home. I have a child to raise. - Are you in school? - I've got a job. - Where? - Chico's grocery shop. He called here looking for you. CIVIL RECORDS - Did you know this person? - No. You look like the description we got from the widow. Call her. If she recognizes me, you can arrest me and release them, okay? Mandelão It's a big hit due to the cool kids Dancing Maloka with the brothers It's a big hit due to the cool kids Dancing Maloka with the brothers Stoned, so stoned Stoned, so stoned It's a big hit due to the cool kids Dancing Maloka with the brothers Morning, Chico! - Hi, guys. - Hi, Chico. - Where's Doni? - Is he in? He's upstairs. - Get in. - Excuse me. - We're coming in. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - What's up? - The song played again today. - It's a hit, bro. - It's hot. Whose song were they asking Dondoka to play? Whose song? From our brother, MC Doni. Brother, I don't know what Tia Lú puts in this bologna sandwich because it's the best in the world. We need this in the barbershop. - You know what this is? - Smoked bologna. This is love, bro. Love. Don't you know? Unbelievable! Check this out. It's Dondoka. Son of a bitch! Come on! Don't get upset! At least we know it's your song. Your call is being forwarded to the mailbox... You can try again later. - Did he come back? - No. You should get someone to teach him a lesson. He's the father of my son. But when he drinks, he's possessed... It's the evil spirit. I know this story. My father was the same and my mom got fucked up. Evil spirit. An excuse for those who don't have the guts to take responsibility. Who did this to you? I got into a fight. Boyfriend? A crazy woman who blames me for everything. But people say God is fair. Are you talking about Jussara's daughter? You shouldn't have done that. That girl was so calm. That girl, Cacau, is my best friend. I would never hurt her. Things aren't good for you. It's no use to have a bandit friend to protect you. If I were you, sister, I'd get out of here. Get up, kid. There's a lawyer waiting for you. In the silver car. What did they want? I don't know. Lucky you're a nobody. When a lawyer gets involved, they know that someone's got your back. We're always dodging them. But you can tell Badá that it won't happen again. Do you think Badáhas a cell in prison just to send you messages? - What's your name again? - Nando. None of this is for free. Now you're committed to crime. Our life is one of crime. Got that, boss? Let's go. Busy day, Nando? I'm dead. I thought you were. Uncle Chico even sent a chocolate cake. He does it every now and then. You're lying. Excuse me. - Careful. She's sleeping. - Okay. I know you were arrested. I wasn't arrested. It was just some questions. Everything was okay, so they let me go. If you go to jail, we're screwed. We don't even have a bank account. Scheyla, it's okay. You're not on your own. Promise you'll always tell me the truth. Promise me that our family comes first. Promise me, Nando. I promise. You didn't want to take me with you. You got screwed. - Hello? - Doni, where are you? Don't do shit with my gun! Are you playing smart? - I didn't do anything. - Why did you take my gun? To put me in jail or to show off? Whoever pulls the gun has to shoot. Do you know how much shit you could have got me into? Yes. That's why I did what I did. This is my thing. It's my dream. Nobody will take it from me. - Hi. - I need to talk to MC Dondoka. Her manager Éder said nobody can go in. This is MC Doni, she knows us. - Thanks. - Excuse me. Get it together! Amazing, brother! Man, this is the hit you promised me. Fucking amazing! - This year... - Éder! Nice to meet you. I've got an issue to discuss. An issue? Listen, just give me a minute to sort this out and I'll be right back. Guys! Over here! Kekel, Dani. - What's up? - Hi. - All good? - Yeah, cool. Big fan of yours! - Cool, thanks! - Cool. Give me some tips. I'm an MC too, MC Doni. Be committed to what you do. You gotta work hard. - Believe in your dreams. - Believe it! Your MC recorded my brother's song without permission. How do we sort this out? Let me listen. "Rolling In Our Ride" is mine, you stole it. You're mistaken. Nobody stole it. What do you mean? Are you shitting me? You stole it. Nobody stole anything and nobody is shitting you. You stole it! How do we sort this out? - I'm calling security, or the police. - Calm down! - Let's work this out. - MC Doni? I can't believe it! Did you bring him in? Excuse me. Your song... He's got such a baby face. I can't believe it! This kid made that sound? Son of a bitch! That's my crew. I just wanna get my stuff. I'm not going to sit here while Jussara tells lies. That's what she wants. I know you want to help. But I don't back down from a fight. I have to see Cacau. Did you see the photos I left for you? Whenever you want to talk about what happened to your parents... Clarice was my best friend. You weren't there. I was with her until the end. After what happened to your dad, your mom wouldn't answer my calls. He didn't let her. I didn't know she was ill. I want to go back to my life, to my home, to my hustle. Okay, it's up to you. Think about it. My house is always open to you. I've always wanted a white Land Rover. Like Star Wars. You're there in your ship and the spaceship takes you wherever you want, you know? I want to go further. Guys, we came to sort out this song that you recorded. Yeah. It's like when something was made for you. Like a real connection. Brother, your song is really good! And I haven't heard anything so good for a long time. It's a great honor to have MC Dondoka recording a song from a beginner songwriter like... - What's your name? - Doni. Like him. So you agree he has rights over his song. I see it more like a homage. And there's a really simple way to handle this. Five hundred. How much do you get for a gig? About ten grand, right? You do the math! Get real! A grand? There's 700 more here, for a total of 1,200. Okay. Listen, let's make the most of this. It's your song. It's really good! I'll record it, it'll be a hit. It already is a hit. It's going to be huge! Record one of my songs with me. - Another song? - Yeah, I've got several. Come on, this is too much. - Let's go. - Nobody leaves. Do you know who I am? Why? Who are you? Enough! Calm down! Peace! Chill out. Sit back down. Okay. Show me what you've got. I want to see. We've got an hour in the studio, right? But listen, kid. If your song doesn't get me hot, - I'm not recording it. - All right. It's all about Dondoka. Listen to this one. It's no use telling me you love me I don't want love with no strings attached I warned you not to get too close You've got a crush, now what? It's a taste of your own medicine Time's gone by, that's just how life is NANDO HOW LONG BEFORE YOU PICK ME UP? I didn't know you knew Vanessa as well. I'M SORTING THINGS OUT WITH DONI BUT I'LL MEET YOU WHEN IT'S DONE. DON'T GO ANYWHERE! - Let's go. - Let's record this. From the top. One, two, three, four. It's no use telling me you love me I don't want love with no strings attached I warned you not to get too close You've got a crush, now what? It's a taste... Hold on, DJ. Something is not right. - Just carry on as it is. - He said it's not right. His song's amateur. These guys are producers. It's just so it doesn't end up flat. Do what he's asking! RD? Can you do that? I'll try to do something here. He's good. All set. Let's see now. It's no use telling me you love me I don't want love with no strings attached I warned you not to get too close You've got a crush, now what? It's a taste of your own medicine Time's gone by, that's just how life is Yesterday I told you I loved you But today I already forgot you I don't care, I don't care Weren't you the one who liked fooling me? I don't care, I don't care RD, let's go back a bit so I can sing with him. You do the first part, I do the second. You carry on, we do the chorus together. - Let's do it. - Okay? Come on, boy! - Just a little tweak. It's awesome! - Let's have some energy. It's no use telling me you love me I don't want love with no strings attached I warned you not to get too close You've got a crush, now what? It's a taste of your own medicine Time's gone by, that's just how life is Yesterday I told you I loved you But today I already forgot you I don't care, I don't care Yesterday I told you I loved you But today I already forgot you I don't care, I don't care Weren't you the one who liked fooling me? I don't care, I don't care FORMIGÃO: BRO, JUNINHO'S IN DEEP SHIT! WHERE ARE YOU? Come on, one, two... Let me re-record my part while he's not here. Let's do this. FORMIGÃO LET'S GO AND SORT THIS OUT FOR JUNINHO - Are you leaving? - Yeah, I've got to go. But we're in the studio. It's our dream: me, you and Rita. Everything is fine. Call me if you need me. - Nice one. - Thanks, man. - It's harmony. - You're the man. - Get back in there. - Okay. But today I already forgot you I don't care Has he left? I don't care Get back there with some energy. - It's sounding good. - Baby! You disappeared! Come here! Let's record this. RD. Come on, let's double-track it. - Let's go! - We'll get a fuller sound. Here. From the start. It's no use telling me you love me I don't want love with no strings attached I warned you not to get too close You've got a crush, now what? It's a taste of your own medicine Time's gone by, that's just how life is Yesterday I told you I loved you But today I already forgot you I don't care, I don't care Weren't you the one who liked fooling me? I don't care, I don't care Yesterday I told you I loved you But today I already forgot you I don't care, I don't care Weren't you the one who liked fooling me? I don't care, I don't care Let's do the move. The move... It's no use telling me you love me I don't want love with no strings attached I warned you not to get too close You've got a crush, now what? It's a taste of your own medicine Time's gone by, that's just how life is Yesterday I told you I loved you But today I already forgot you I don't care, I don't care Weren't you the one who liked fooling me? I don't care, I don't care How much is missing? We don't know. Some books are gone, you know. But it's a lot. We can't save Juninho. We have to solve this by ourselves. - Me and you? - Yeah, me and you. That's it. Like you said. Let's get him. Come here. Check this out! MC Doni, MC Dondoka. New song: "I Love You, No Strings Attached." Yeah! That's it, bro! Catch it on the dance floor soon. - Get on this! - That's it! If you want more songs like that, I have several. I want that. I want to see everything. Hey kid! One more drink! Help yourself. Caio, RD, call it a day. Let's go? Dondoka, let's go. Can you help her get her things? I'm taking one for the road. - It was pretty cool. - Here it is. It just needs a killer video clip - and we've got a hit. - We could do it at the hood party. We'll see, Dondoka. Let's go. Come on. Turn everything off. See you later. Éder, when are we going to do this? Do you think Dondoka will shoot a video with you? She said she would! She doesn't share the limelight. So, what do I do now? Thank your friend. You got what you wanted. You recorded with her. Now you have a song to show your friends. It's better for us to walk hand in hand with each other. Because it's harder on our own. We walk in koinonia. Because if you fall, those around you will help you up. And if the enemy wants to defeat you, evil will not prevail. And why? Because the holy bond will not be broken. Christ is our strength, we are the nation of God. Amen! Can I get an amen? Amen! Glory! Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Juninho! Oh, it's you. Get inside. Márcia wants to fuck me over with Badá. I work for him, not her. That bitch who put him in jail. All she thinks about is money. - Where's the money for the week? - Did she send you here? - Now you're her bitch. - Nobody knows I'm here. I wanna sort this out. You killed that guy and think you're the best. I'm here because I respect you so much. If you wanna get in shit with the guys over drugs, it's your call. But you know what will happen - if he doesn't get his money. - Well, look at you Nando... You used to bring us our lunch, you'd never mixed up fries and rice... You asked me, "Juninho, I want a piece of the action. I want to move up the ranks." Now you're doing their dirty work. I'll never forget you had my back. I'm not doing anyone's dirty work. You got lost, partner. You think you're all "thug life" now? You're just a kid! You're a baby. You'll always be a baby. - This is the good shit. - Yeah. - Speak of the devil... - Yeah. - What? - They got her. Here she comes. - She's out of it. - Yes. - She's pissed off. - Take this. No! No! Where's my merch? Hey, Rita? Is everything okay? Where is my merch, Jussara? It's all the work I've got. Merch? What merch? Listen, girl. You'll get what you deserve, but not from me. You've got crooks looking out for you... So do I. Rita, where were you? - I told you to stay here. - Shut up, Nando. I found a new place for you. - What am I gonna do somewhere else? - You can't go back there. Promise me. There's nothing left! They took everything! I don't have a home! I don't have any merch to sell! Fuck! Cacau is in juvie, bro. Jussara is calling the higher ranks to get this sorted. She can call them. They're gonna check on you and your family. Do you know what that means? What's the problem? I'm not like my father. I have nothing to hide. And I'm on my own. You're not on your own! I'm here! Rita, go to this new place. It's going to be better. - I'm not running away. - Where are you going to go? I can stay here. All right. Fine. What happened to you? It's like you're not even here. Hello, my family! It's amazing, brother. I can't believe it's you. This is us. The three of us. What's that face for? I don't know. What's next? Get to work. Play your song at gigs, in videos. Parties. It's not that easy, Rita. You guys make it difficult. My dad's watching me like a hawk. Listen, brother, be there for your dad. Chico is a great man. I wish I had a dad like that. Are you okay? You've been distant lately. You seem far away. What's the matter? Nothing, brother. I'm cool. Bro? We're family, Nando. I killed a man. Subtitle translation by Patricia Bins Ely
