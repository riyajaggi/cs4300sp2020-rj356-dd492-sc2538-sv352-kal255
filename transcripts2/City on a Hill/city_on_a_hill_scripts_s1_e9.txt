 May I? So, who'd you used to be? Beg your pardon? You know, before...? Shit, man, I had an apartment. Roommate. Went to work. Wore a suit and tie. Never had to burn mine, though. You know, this used to be a white neighborhood. - Mm. - Yeah, it was 
  subslikescript native automated 'subslikescript article'  
 
 just as shitty then as it is now. Same sort of people, different color. Black families moved in. All our neighbors left. We stayed, though. It's all we knew. You're standing right where our kitchen used to be. But my mother burned the house down. Forty years. Forty fuckin' years. Still just a big fuckin' pile of nothin'. Nobody rebuilt. I mean... not us, not the community, not the fuckin' city. - Mm. - Everyone just looked,

 saw a shithole, and looked away. As though this was the way things were supposed to be. - These clean? - Yup. Sourced out of state, like you asked. Hey, feel free to tell me to fuck off, but this time, maybe you don't share these toys with your maniac brother. Fuck off. Girl, you look good. Like "rush of blood" good. Is not saying anything your way of telling me that you're still angry? I'm not angry. Are you sure? Nope. Just irritated. Well, I'd be happy to debate the difference between the two... but... I'll just apologize instead. Hey. I should have told you that I helped expose Fields. That's right. You should've. Lesson learned. And moving forward, I will be shamefully honest, no matter what. Forgive me? Hmm? I will. Just not today. Tomorrow, then? If we're being shamefully honest, probably not tomorrow either. What are we waitin' for? Let's badge Jimmy Ryan. Now that we know he's Jackie's long-lost informant, we're gonna tail him till he fucks up. He's a punk kid from Charlestown. He will fuck up. You know what your problem is, Hank? You have too much patience. His mom just left the ICU. Let him spend some time with his family, then I swear we'll ruin his life. Come on, here we go. There we go. Here we go. Welcome home, Ma. Hey, Cat. Oh, of course you run right to him. Hey, she got out of the hospital 20 minutes ago, Jimmy. - Let her breathe. - It's not a competition, okay? I just haven't seen him in a while. All right, let's go. Let's go, Ma. Come on. How long you think he'll be in there? Couple minutes. Couple hours. Couple days. Well, at least we know where he is. Still no sign of Clay Roach. If I were to follow up on that, you... you good here on your own? Bring me back a Big Mac? Clay? Clay Roach? Ohh. Ugh. What are you doin' in there, sweetie? Yeah, the cold tub feels good. Listen... Benny, I, uh... I... I... You were right. That place that you want to send Benny up in Vermont... go ahead and make the arrangements. I already did. Ahh. Ahhh. - Hey, Jimmy! - Fuck. - What are you doin' down here? - I'm just cleanin'. When did you ever clean anything in your life? What the fuck? Everything's fine. Everything doesn't look fine to me. No, Dad... I wasn't gonna do nothin'. Jesus, Jimmy. It's just, uh... I'm just... I'm just tired of letting everybody down, you know? Son... that would be the ultimate letdown. Watch out. I'm gonna go tell your mother. I'm gonna call Frankie. No. No, no, no, no. No, Dad, Dad, just... just don't, okay? Look, I'm fine. And I'm gonna fix this. Yeah, I'm... I'm gonna fix everything. All right? You been taking care of me my whole life, okay? It's time for me to take care of you. It's okay. It's fine. Just say no. Stop and search. Mandatory minimums. Life sentences for repeat offenders. Billions spent on expanded law enforcement. Billions more on incarceration. We're losing the war on drugs 'cause we don't fully understand what we're fighting for. Casualties should be our focus. So this Genesis Coalition is about murder prevention? Prevention programs exist for forest fires, tax fraud. Why not apply that same vigilance to homicide? Call me naive, but you stop a murder how? Group hugs and Kumbaya? - Something like that. - We approach the gangs from as many different angles as possible. School, church, police. Then we strike a bargain. Tell 'em we'll back off if, and only if, the violence stops. Buddying up to the criminals we're trying to root out. You know, that's a pretty sharp U-turn. And the gangs aren't gonna play along. My guys aren't gonna play along either. I'm one of your guys, and I fully support the idea. - Of course you do. - Oh, - what's that supposed to mean? - As far as I recall, the DA's job is to punish illegal activity and to put the bad guys in jail. What, the bad guys from Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan? Hm? The pink elephant in the room ain't always pink. African Americans comprise 12% of the population, 40% of all crime, 60% of homicides. And where are the numbers explaining why? The statistics on prejudice and neglect? She's right. Discrimination is bad arithmetic. Some people count. Others aren't even in the damn equation. Jeez. You two really are a match made in heaven. Hmm. Now, see, that's the first thing you said that I actually agree with. How great you kept all your dad's model airplanes. Yeah. Here you go. Yeah, as soon as Ma dies, boom, right in the dumpster. Yeah! It kind of creeped me out, grown man makin' models. All that glue must've fucked up his brain. Yeah, in more ways than one. So, midday wine. What's the deal? I'm gonna sue Jackie for a divorce. Honey. You're sure? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I was your maid of honor. I've been with you from the beginning in this mistake. Okay, first thing. I'm gonna get you the number of the lawyer Cabot used for his first divorce. Guy's not human. He will destroy Jackie in court. Second, you're gonna find all the checks and credit cards. Freeze the accounts so Jackie can't hide your money. Third, you're gonna write down all the shit he's pulled and the details of why you're filing, so the attorney can get every dime. You okay? Twenty years. I want my 20 years back. What's that look for? I've got hope... for the first time in a while. There's always a whole lot of talk at those meetings. At least now we're having the right conversation. I mean... hope for us. With all that bad out there, I feel good about the good in here. You know, when things with the Coalition are going well, our relationship goes well. But when things are bad... Th-There's a correlation, is all I'm saying. You remember Halloween freshman year? Do you remember? That was the drunkest I'd ever seen you. Mm, I spent the entire next day in bed, hung over as hell. We're in Barcia's philosophy class, had a big paper due, but all I could do was sleep and moan. You got up early, wrote both papers. I didn't even ask. You just wanted to help. And you still got the better grade. Yo, Professor Barcia had a crush on you. That's the day I fell in love with you. You know why? Because you were too hung over to think straight? Because love is putting someone else's happiness before your own... and trusting that they'll do the same. We've always taken care of each other. In here and out there. It was a quiet night. Jimmy's still in there. Ten-four, Joe. Thanks. It's driving me fuckin' crazy. Why would Roach, a protected and paid informant, kill himself? A CI falling on his sword when he's no longer useful. When he's outed as a rat. What happened to Clay Roach is hardly front-page news. Won't even get him an obituary. But when... when you put a gun in your mouth, you open wide. Not this jackoff. His lips, his teeth... gone. You've dealt with beefers before. You know the kind of shit-bum we're talking about. If he didn't kill himself, some Bromley Heath dirtbag did. But when a gangbanger offs a rat, they make a show of killing him. It sends a message. Disguising his death as a suicide, it reeks of blue polyester. Now, the lab's checking Roach's hand for gunpowder residue, right? - Mm-hmm. - We'll finish this conversation when we get the results back. Your neighbor downstairs held the door for me. - Hmm. - Your husband home? You just missed him. But you didn't come here to talk to Decourcy. You'd have gone to his office. You got me. So you're staying? Yeah, if you don't mind. So, how is he? That's the second time you've shown up here wondering that. Why don't you ask him yourself? Ah, I would. Truth is, I think he's ducking me. I'm right, aren't I? I don't know. Maybe he's trying to distance himself. Tanking informant program. FBI's catching heat. Again. Well, shit. Ah, pardon me for that. People don't love law enforcement like they used to. Or lawyers, for that matter. Do you know there's this tribe in Nigeria where the night before a wedding they have this tradition that the bride's family takes the groom out and kicks the living crap out of him to see if he's worthy. Right? It's pretty inhuman to us. But to them, it's just how they do things. It's their way of life. Who are we to say that ours is any better? Looks like you went through the ritual yourself. Oh. Oh. Ah-ha. No, it's change of season, you know? - I'll get you a towel. - No, no, that's all right. Uh, need to get back. FBI needs the manpower, right? No need to tell Decourcy I stopped by. Hey, Ma. You didn't want to send Benny off? Give her a goodbye? She'll be fine. Yeah? It's a tough thing to swallow, though, that she'll get better away from us. I just keep thinking of all the things I could've done. All the things I should've done better. Don't be so dramatic. Your only job as a parent is to keep your kids alive long enough to have kids of their own. The rest is up to them. I made my peace with that years ago. Yeah, of course you did. So this is my fault? Don't you dare put this on me. All this shit with Benny started the day you went back to school. You want to blame someone, go look in the fuckin' mirror. ♪ And the thought takes place uptown ♪ ♪ I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk ♪ ♪ And then taught to hawk New York... ♪ You got in a fistfight with your high school principal? You're never fightin'. You boxed. It was a different era. Catholic schools in the '50s. Nuns and priests beat the kids. And your parents were okay with this? They went through the same thing, probably worse. Okay, so you... You and the principal...? Father McKenna. Junior year in basketball practice. Things get chippy, and I clip some kid. Not a big deal. - Just teenage boy bullshit. - Mm-hmm. Father McKenna's standing at the doorway and doesn't say a word, just leaves. And we keep playing like nothing happened. Father McKenna comes back, walks down to the court and says, "Wrong sport." He hands me a pair of boxing gloves. Who won? Father McKenna was built like Andre Tippett. One punch, I'm out cold. You know, I'm not sure who the bigger asshole is here, you or him. Definitely me. Father McKenna was a good man. Well, then why'd you fight him? Because... you get a chance to hit the guy at the head of the table, you take a swing. Where's my brother? He's doin' the heavy lifting. We need you to boost a getaway car. Shouldn't you handle that? I got a record, you got a badge. Jimmy, are you gonna carry your weight on this, or you gonna make me and Frank do all the fuckin' work? All right. ♪ There goes my gun ♪ ♪ There goes my gun ♪ ♪ There goes my gun ♪ ♪ There goes my gun ♪ Hey there, handsome. You havin' some car trouble? The fuck you gonna do about it? Total mystery. Like fuckin' Twilight Zone. Kelly Kinicki was here, then he wasn't. But for all we know, maybe, you know, he got sick of his wife and ran off with something tighter. Where were you the night he went missing? Not at the Ebb Tide, for fuck's sake. Just give me your best guess as to what transpired that evening. Eh, you serious? Isn't that illegal? Like... like hearsay, or some shit? Hey, you let me worry about the law, Mr. Ryan. I-I just want you to talk. You don't want to get me talking, I won't shut up. Another person of interest in the case, Tommy Hayes. - Any idea where he is? - Nope. And let the record show I can't fuckin' stand that guy. Jackie Rohr. What about him? So you know Jackie? Is that why I'm here? What's the nature of your relationship? Boy Scouts. He was my pack leader. That guy knows how to stroke a cock. I-I don't doubt that. But Mr. Ryan, if Jackie's ever screwed you over, made you do something you found questionable, now's the time to stop lying and start telling the truth. Oh, no, you're the one who's lying, pal. Yeah. You're the one who asked about Jackie, which means this is about the bank guards. You don't give a single fuck about poor white trash Kelly Kinicki. You're right. I don't. I don't much care for you either. You looked me in the eye when you said that. That's good. Now we can be honest with each other and you can tell me what the fuck you want. From you? Absolutely nothing. Your walls are tumbling down. We got you dead to rights. Sheik Sheehan's in jail. The grand jury's stampeding. You're not dumb. You knew this day would come. Looks like we got two options. You can let me call my lawyer and we can get on with this grand theft auto bullshit. And option two? You can let me walk out that door and boost a car. Now why the hell would I do that? Because... there's gonna be another armored truck robbery. Same gang as Revere. Soon. Real soon. Okay. Let's hear the details. Nah, the only detail that matters is... I'm in a cell, the heist won't happen, you get nothin'. But you let me go... you can stop the thing. You could be fuckin' Superman. If I'm Superman, who are you? I'm a guy who always owes somebody somethin'. I want to try it the other way around for once. Where are the kids? Uh, down the street. Playin' with the Donnellys. Husband's at work? Yeah. Why? I want to talk to you alone. Oh, Jesus. What? I promised I wouldn't tell Frankie, so I'm telling you instead. Jimmy tried to kill himself. Holy shit. What, pills? What? He made a noose out of a jump rope. Christ. He even tries to kill himself like a fuckin' child. Argh! You know I gotta tell Frankie this, right? That's why I'm tellin' you. They gotta call off the job. They gotta call it off. It is... it's not worth the risk. It's... Jimmy's out of his goddamn mind! Hey, no matter what you say, you're not going to be able to convince him. Same goes for Frankie. Then you gotta say something to him. Oh. He used to listen to me. That went away a long time ago. You know what I'm talkin' about, Cathy. You're already feeling the gulf with Kick. Fuck. Hey, pencil dick. It's funny how that works. I say "pencil dick," you instinctively react. And who might you be? Rachel Benham, County Sheriff's office. What can I do for you? Clay Roach. Who's that? He's an informant for you guys at the FBI. Never heard of him. Hmm. Then why'd you give Michaela Freda his name? I found her notebook. Southie Clasby, Clay Roach. Big, fat arrow connecting you two. And yet you never heard of the guy? You know, there's a reason little girls play house while little boys play cops and robbers. Have you heard? Heard what? Clay Roach is dead. And he didn't die of old age. Jackie. I spied you coming down the hall. You want to sign the card? - No. - You sure? Actually, I'd like to change my answer to "fuck, no." Not even for Salvie? He was your partner, for Chrissake's. Maybe Gladys and I will go to the Bahamas. How you doin'? Get the fuck out. You quittin'? I'm not quittin'. I'm retirin'. It's the same fuckin' thing. It just sounds nicer. It's... it's like saying "mentally challenged" when your kid's a fuckin' retard. What the fuck are you gonna do all day? Sleep in, afternoon jog, glass of wine before bed, be with my wife. Oh. I cannot begin to tell you how fuckin' miserable that sounds. A normal person would congratulate me. Well, let's not start to measure normal. You don't quite qualify either, all right? Jackie... I don't know what I'm doing here anymore. My instincts are gone. All I got are habits. Our boss is under investigation for using FBI money to fix up his house. I want to get out while I'm still in the black. You should do the same. Fuck that. I want my pension. Bullshit. You want glory. Well, the thing about glory, I wear it so well. You ever feel guilty, Jackie? I mean, after all the shit we pulled? Fidelity, bravery, integrity. That's our motto, right? But you can never have all three. Sometimes being brave cuts you off from the fidelity part. And integrity? Integrity is like pussy. We drive ourselves crazy thinking that we need pussy. But at the end of the day, pussy don't get us where we need to go. What we do... gotta be an animal to fight the animals. Yeah. That's why I'm quittin'. Does God watch me pee? Tony! Why would you ask a question like that, buddy? My CCD teacher said God can see everything all the time. Must mean he sees me pee. True. That's why girls sit down, to hide their privates. - Kick! - All right. Ignore your sister. God is a gentleman, and he closes his eyes when you're in the bathroom. Dad, can we see the airplanes after school? We just saw the airplanes? So? I like 'em. We can't go the same place twice. That's... boring. We're gonna try something new, all right? - For real? - For real. I got loads of secret spots. I got spots that are so secret that sometimes I can hardly find 'em myself. All right, you guys. Come on, finish. We gotta go. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye. - Coats, please. Backpacks. - Boom! Boom! Bam! Bow. Here, lunches. Coats on. Lunches are right here. Grab your backpack, please. Get your brother's. I'll pick you up from school at 3:00 sharp. Okay, Daddy. I'm gonna call you after work. Okay. I love you. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye-bye, guys. Have a good one. All right, guys, let's get goin'. In the car. Come on, let's go. - Hi, Uncle Jimmy. - Oh, hey, sweetheart. - Have a good day at school. - Bye. Bye. You take your meds today? Yeah, I did. Two blues and a yellow. Thank you, Dr. Cathy. Be a man today, Jimmy, all right? I mean it. Hey, all right, come on. In the car. Fuck's her problem? I don't know. I think she's concerned with how things are gonna go... considering you tried to kill yourself. Oh, fuck. Ma told you. Fuckin' bitch. Fuck. Cathy thinks... I think... you should sit this one out. And leave you a man short? No way. Why'd you hang that noose? Because I heard about how when you're gettin' strangled, the blood that's supposed to go to your brain - goes to your nutsack. - Yeah. I'm serious, Jimmy. There's nothing fuckin' serious about it, okay? I... it's just... It's a fuckin' misunderstanding. I-I drank too much. And... and then, you know, I got sad about Megan and... And Nikki leaving. It's fuckin' embarrassing, is all. There's no shame in you walking away right now. I'm fine. All right? Actually, I'm better off, all right? I got clarity now. And maybe... maybe Cathy's only half wrong. I think you should sit this one out. I may be a fuckup, all right? But I know that about myself. Every time that I... that I get involved in something, there's always a chance it could turn to shit, you know? And... if that happens, I just... I don't wanna... I don't wanna drag you down with me, you know? That's why I got to be there. To make sure that everything goes as it should. Yeah. Yeah. Jenny. You weren't in class. You missed my presentation on psychoanalysis. DJ, I... I'm droppin' out. I thought teaching was your passion. How would I know if it's my passion? I've never taught a day in my entire life. I feel like an asshole for even saying that. Look, quitting is a big decision. You said I'm a good listener, so before you do anything just let me listen. DJ... You don't have to do anything to me. I can just take care of you. This should be fun. No stress. Yeah, there's just... it's just there's rules against this. Being unfaithful. I'm Catholic. - So am I. - Yeah, but you ain't married. How about we just talk? Jenny, the last thing I want to do is make you feel uncomfortable. Please don't be nice. I-I know you mean well, but, you know you're... you sound like, uh... My whole life, I've only been with two men. And neither of them treated me any good. Your husband... does he hurt you? No, no, it's not like that. No, Jackie, uh, doesn't abuse me. At least not physically. Huh. Like that's a compliment. And the other guy? Did he hit you? No, worse. I never told anyone, uh, but Jackie knew somethin' happened. Somethin'... bad. And a couple of years after we got married, Jackie confronted him, made him leave town. At least I think that's what happened. Jackie could have killed him, for all I know. Who was this asshole? It was my dad. Happened in our basement. That's where I used to do my homework. I was 14. He was drunk. Sweaty. He... He had this blister on his thumb. I couldn't look at him. So I just... I turned my head. All I could do was stare at his stupid airplanes. When I finally told my ma, she seemed... happy... that he went after me and not some stranger, you know? Me. Me, she could control. Bleach out the stain. She even drove me herself to make sure the mistake was taken care of. Anytime there's a robbery, the police point their fingers at Charlestown. So we're going to throw 'em off the scent. A couple of receipts in the glove. A McDonald's in Cranston. A gas station in Elmhurst. Placed a lifted hair sample on the dash where any New England cop can find it. Two getaway cars parked at the scene. Me, Jimmy, Joe, drive it to the chop shop. Bernie uses the other one to disappear the guns at the Central Landfill. Are you sure you can trust this old fuck with a gun? Maybe give him a whistle instead, huh? I got us Red Sox tickets. Day game. Save the stub, study the box score. We each had a beer and a pretzel. So Rachel and I will be in the rear compartment of the armored car. The perps will most likely enter the parking lot here. We confront them head-on. Cruisers pull it, cut off their exits here and here. We'll have officers inside the wholesaler that'll pop out once the fun starts. I called down at Bristol County. They got jurisdiction, but they threw us a courtesy mutual, given the connection to Revere. Said they'd provide backup and a medical team. And what about FBI, SWAT? FBI won't be joining us today. Why not? What'd you do? Nothin'. I just don't want Jackie. Anywhere near this case anymore. Halle-fuckin'-lujah. Two years in, already I miss the fuckin' '80s. Everybody was makin' money. None of this recession shit. The bad guys were in Russia, not in Tailhook. President was a fuckin' movie star. He shoulda stayed a fuckin' movie star. Well, you can't blame a guy for trying to make his way up in the world. - Hey, I got a story for ya. - Of course you do. What, all of a sudden you don't like my stories? Not now, Jackie. I'm covering for a sick colleague. I got three trials, all waste-of-time misdemeanors. Where are these ass-fucks? Something goin' on today? - Always. - With Decourcy Ward, I mean. Well, you never know with him. Ain't you supposed to be supervising? What's the matter? Ward pull the welcome mat out from under your feet? Ah, so there is something going on? You created a monster, Jackie, in your own image and likeness. Oh, don't pin that shit on my chest. We're just cooperating on a case. Cooperating with you is kissing your ass and thanking you for the opportunity. You still have not answered my question. You know what, Jackie? You always reminded me of the deaf sage of Pompeii. - You remember him? - No, I don't do the Roman shit. It's too fuckin' long ago to make a difference. Plus, they were all pederasts, so no fuckin' thanks. Yeah, well, you talk and talk and talk, but you never listen. I mean, you weren't made to hear, so when the volcano blows and the fire and brimstone start raining down, you don't notice all the screaming. You're just standing out in the backyard, your prick in your hand, pissing in your garden. As they say, from the ashes. You're stalling. Where the fuck is he? - What? - Where is he? Fall River. Fall River? That's Bristol County. What the fuck is he doing there? Making headlines. This is Rohr.

You're fuckin' prayin'? Yeah. Faggot. I got a MAC-10 sitting between my feet. You're calling me names? Hey, you want to know what God is? - Jimmy... - No, no, no. You want to know what God is? Look at me, look at me. He's that little voice in your head that refuses to believe that this doesn't end. Refuses to accept that all the shit that you do every fuckin' day - is totally fuckin' meaningless. - I said enough, Jimmy. Fuckin' meaningless.

It's for kids. - Cathy, take the little ones. - Holy shit. I can't listen to this today. You okay, Cath? I'm fine. You don't seem fine. I've got a headache, and I need a little bit of quiet. Is this 'cause of the mistake you made with Liz and Perry? What, I make one fuckin' mistake, you get to throw that shit in my face?! - Huh?! - That's not what I meant. Oh, it's not what you meant. You know what? How about you don't worry about my mistakes and start worrying about your own, 'cause you make plenty. Yeah, matter of fact... You know what? Pack your fuckin' scissor kit. Pack your scissor kit, pack your fuckin' hair spray, your fuckin' mousse, your boyfriend's picture, and get the fuck out of my salon! You're fired! I'm sorry. I was just making sure you were okay. Okay. Annie... forget I said that, all right? Just take the rest of the day off. Just go home. Salon's dead anyway. We got time for a bathroom break? I can never tell when you're joking. Well, when the nerves kick in, my stomach goes wild. All right, you full of shit? Yeah. That's what I'm sayin'. I've sat in a car with you for hundreds of hours. I've watched you stuff your face like a fat fuck, day after day, and not once did you ever need a toilet. I wasn't nervous then. Well, you're not nervous now either, all right? You're just saying you are because you know that I am. We can't both be nervous? Fine, I'll hold it. Brinksmen, you've got company. We see 'em. All right, let's go. Fuck! - Shit. - Police! Drop the guns! - Down on the ground! - Fuck! Let's go! Move! Hit 'em. FBI! FBI! Don't move! You're surrounded! Nowhere to go! Don't move your hands or... Don't do anything stupid! - Put your weapons down! - Everyone shut up! We are armed officers of the law! If provoked, we will fire! Now turn the engine off, throw the keys out the window, step down from the vehicle. We don't wanna hurt you. Don't give us a reason to. Drop the guns, put your hands in the air - and walk towards me. - Fuck! FBI! Think for a second! You're outgunned and outnumbered! - What do we do? - There's only one way this ends well for you. Be smart! Oh, fuck, Frankie. Being a pussy wasn't part of the plan. Get out of the car! Throw out your weapons! Damn it, get out of the car! Obey our commands or we will shoot! Fuck it. There's no place to go! Exit the car! Hands in the air! Someone's gonna cast the first stone. - You are surrounded! - Yeah. Get out of the car! No! Frankie. Motherfucker! Officer down! Officer down! Officer down! Get out of the fuckin' car! Everybody calm down. Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Bernie Hannahan, Boston PD. I am a hostage. Fucking weasel. Remove the keys from the ignition. Over the mirror, asshole. Hands on your head. Hands on your head! Get out of the fuckin' car. C'mon. All right, stand down. Listen to me, all right? Okay? Don't you go nowhere, okay? I'm shot. Where would I be going? Fuckin' vultures. Blood is on your hands, Jackie. Not the time to point fingers I'm not pointing fingers. I'm just letting you know. Despite whatever you might be thinking, you're no fuckin' hero. Not now, not ever. Never claimed to be. Just doing my job, same as you. So why don't you save your preaching for someone who gives a flying shit. Don't... Oh. You ain't gonna swing on me, D. Not your style. If you were, you would have done it months ago. Hey, Mommy. Hey, guys. Hey. Come here. Seat belts. It's times like these I wish I was still a smoker. Any sign of Hank's wife and son? Not exactly a quick drive from Hyde Park at this hour. Working this job, I've realized that most people are good. Ninety-nine percent of the men and women I've met try to be decent, honest. But that one percent... that one percent is very loud, and very active, and very, very effective. You sound like you admire the prick. Not at all. I want Jackie Rohr out of my life. I may be able to help with that. Good. You're finally home. I have an idea I want to bounce off you. We're trying to stop the flow of guns by addressing demand, gangs on the streets. What if we attack the supply side too? We organize a boycott of any bank that issues business loans to firearms manufacturers. Decourcy? State police detective Hank Signa was killed when the FBI made a major bust today in Fall River. Four men driving a stolen vehicle and armed with automatic weapons attempted to rob a Brinks truck containing... Can't sleep. Half million dollars... What's the matter? Nightmares? No. Just can't sleep. - Come here. - When officers arrived, one of the suspects opened fire and was subsequently gunned down. The three remaining suspects are in custody. These people are responsible for several robberies in the Greater Boston Area. This isn't a personal victory, though. This is a victory for honor, decency, in this great city of Boston. Despite our hard work and sacrifice, the FBI has developed a bad reputation. That ends right now. This was a bad day. It's a bad day, but that's all this is. It's just one bad day. Ten years earlier. The suspects are also under investigation for another armored car... There's gonna be good days again soon. Your grandpa... my dad... he's the nicest guy in the world. Whenever I couldn't sleep, he used to sing to me. FBI! FBI! - Clear. All clear. - Clear. All clear. Load in. Take whatever you want, and then load out. My husband's already in custody. The fuck else do you want?! Hey, you can't do that! Actually, Mrs. Ryan, we can. Mommy? Who are all these people? Guys, okay, we're gonna take a little ride. All right? We're gonna go get in the car. Come on, come on. - What's happening? - Come get your shoes? Nothing, baby. It's all right. Come on, we're going to go. Excuse us! Let's go, Kick. Get your coat. Come here, Tony. Put your coat on. It's all right. We're just gonna go in the car, it's okay. Come on, buddy. Come on. Kick. Kick, come on. Marie, here, help your brother with his shoes. Calm down, Tony, baby, listen... So what are ya, fourth grade? Look at me. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm going to tell you what my father told me the night our house burned down. Life is all about finding happiness in unhappy endings. Fuck you. You'll be fine.
