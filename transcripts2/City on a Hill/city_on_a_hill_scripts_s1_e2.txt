 ♪ ♪ - [WATER TRICKLING] - [BIRDS TWEETING] [QUACKING] I like this, you know? I like the ducks. Make Way for Ducklings. You ever read that to your kids? You got kids, right? [LAUGHS] Anyway, the ducks, they make me laugh. They always look so fucking busy. JACKIE: Why are you so nervous, Jimmy? JIMMY: Huh? What the fuck do I got to be nervous about? JACKIE: You're starting to sound like an asshole.

 JIMMY: Yeah? Yeah? Well, I'm on a comedown, you know? A bit of a high. I'm just getting a little antsy. - The bodies, Jimmy. - Yeah, like I said. I might have heard something. I think I might know where the armored car is. Your story's already changing. You got to be more trusting, pal. Why'd they disappear the truck if there are no fucking bodies in it, huh? Come on. I mean, I know you think I'm dumb. Everybody thinks I'm dumb. I talk too much. But I'm fucking smart enough to know

 that this is a big deal for you, this Revere thing. Armored car, a couple dead guards. You could ride a case like this to your fucking pension. Oh, there it is. That's what all this duck shit has been about. Jimmy Ryan is setting me up for a fucking favor. No favors. No immunity. No protection. Money, 20,000. Immunity from what? I got two little girls in Florida, and they never had their fucking father read them Make Way for Fucking Ducklings, okay? - I need fucking money. - Well, you know, I mean, there's only so far that Uncle could go with this type of thing. Are you gonna cry "poor man" with me? Huh? Huh? You're the great Jackie Rohr. Jimmy, Jimmy, God, give me something tangible that I can hand up to Uncle. Let Uncle know that you're being a good boy. - Come on. - Okay. Well, this Revere thing... it's about how bad you want it, Jackie. How far are you willing to go? Let me ask you something, Jimmy. Do you remember how hard those black parents fought to get their kids on those buses? All the shit that they went through to make sure that their kids went to those lily-white schools. And then the Mau Mau source out Charlestown High where their kids were being bussed, and they figured out that they were just as big shitholes as the ones in Roxbury. And they realized what white people have known all along: That they were just fighting for peanuts in somebody else's shit. So how far am I willing to go? Well, the counterpoint to that is, is it worth it? And the concluding thought there is that you better be fucking careful what you wish for. And just so we're clear here, all right? Just so you understand my meaning, what I'm saying is, if I fucking go to bat for you with this shit, you better hope to fucking Christ that I'm not left picking peanuts out of someone else's shit. Okay. You'll give me 20 grand? How far are you willing to go, Jimmy? The Ebb Tide. What the fuck do I do with that? That's where they got their guns. Hey! Hey, Jackie! Jackie! What about the 20 grand? You gotta be more trusting, pal. [DUCKS QUACKING] Hey, how was New Hampshire? The fuck you grinning about? Guys, this is too much. You might be the only person on earth - to ever say that was a problem. - [LAUGHS] Well, I can't launder this all through here. This is, like, $250,000. Yeah, and then 10% goes to the office. Yeah, and then I can maybe match that. How about more? We can go to the clubs. Gamble some. And you can probably get away with exchanging about 10 grand through there without getting noticed. So we're supposed to just sit on the rest? You guys dump the guns? We sold them back to Hook. What the fuck? Why? How is anyone going to connect us to those guns they found in the hand of some smoke in Roxbury? Huh? Those guns turn up, there's not going to be anyone coming to find us, Kathleen. ["REAL BIG LEAGUER" BY JOHN NEAL PLAYS ON JUKEBOX] ♪ I'm a real big leaguer ♪ [CHATTER] ♪ I'm a rock and roll singer ♪ ♪ I'm a real friendly guy ♪ Give me a Miller Draft. Tap's dry. Give me a bottle then. Sorry, I'm just out. You're Hook, right? Do you know who I am? - I don't need to know. - No? Because I know what you are. [SNIFFLES] You know this place you got here... it's fucking filthy. You need to get somebody to come in here and clean this shit up. [SNORTS] Or you might get a visit from the Board of Health. Oops. ♪ It wasn't me, I'm just a stranger ♪ [KNOCKS] HANK: Yeah? So I called the Staties in New Hampshire about that other armored car case, the one in Nashua. The feds already claimed jurisdiction. So they're not saying if there's a connection with Revere? Can I help you? Oh, um... I should be asking you. I've been assigned to you as an investigator. Rachel Benham. Why do you look so concerned? You ever work murder before? Oh, I see. You think you got stuck with some fucking broad, huh? - I didn't say that. - Okay, well, don't get confused then because I am the one who's stuck. You're the dope who lost the case against a kid who shot a cop. I recruited her. DECOURCY: And you say nothing? Oh, she can take care of herself. Yeah, clearly. What heist in Nashua? The stuff that... Hey. Any of these fucking cold cases connect to a bar up in Revere? DECOURCY: Did you hear about another armored car robbery - up in New Hampshire? - Yeah, but the crime is federal, outside your jurisdiction. Means you can't use it. Oh, good. You got one of every color now. - What the fuck? - Anyway, like I was saying, any of them connect to a bar up in Revere? It's called the Ebb Tide. Guy missing since '88. JACKIE: Who? Kelly Kinicki. [GARGLES] Burn? [SPITS] What's up, Hank? What can you tell us about Kinicki, 1988? Kinicki? Four years ago? You know what? I don't think I want to talk about that case in front of a prosecutor. Prosecutor lost me that case. Really? Because Woods said you blew it. Yeah? He's fucking lying. Yeah, sure, because Boston cops never lie, right? Vern, would I waste your time? Just tell us what went wrong. All right, the case was a heartbreaker. I thought I had the suspect all lined up, and then... And then you didn't? It was a circumstantial case. But it was fucking tight. Just didn't give the DA a lot of room. I mean, you know the odds, you take a drug case to trial. Defendant's got a one-in-three shot of getting off. Fucking prick wouldn't plead. [SCOFFS] Yet you pushed for trial? Hon, are you new at this?

Yeah? Good. Because I come to confess, I'm madly in love with you. That shit don't work on me, kid. That shit don't work what? You're not getting any, you understand? Is that the way for a mother of three to talk? Not getting any what, huh? Not getting any what? I'll slap your face. You always act like I come by needing something. You don't give me any fucking credit. Yeah, well, I never see you otherwise. - JIMMY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Mom? - Yeah? - JIMMY: Oh. Sweetie. Oh. What's the matter, hon? Your mother get jealous of your good looks again? Would you stop it? What do you need? Nothing. Never mind. What's the matter with her? Nothing. She's just tired. Yeah? Those nightmares? What does she see? - Lock your door, will you? - Yeah. - Lock the door. - Yeah! Frankie, I don't feel very comfortable in this. Yeah, I know. Super sorry I made you take off the track suit. We look like two Italian assholes rolling in here with a wad of cash. Nobody's going to wonder where we got it from. This should be a hoot. - Jimmy. Jimmy. - What? What? Shut the fuck up. We're not here to have fun. You understand? This is work. Yeah. You don't just steal the fucking money. You got to get away with stealing the money. You going to throw your accent too? Shut the fuck up. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC CONTINUES, NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] JIMMY: Oh, come on, come on, come on. Oh! Man, fuck me! [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY] [GIGGLES] [MOANS] Uh, don't take this the wrong way, but what's that thing right there? Are you fucking kidding me? I got a wife. You know this. DOCTOR: Mr. Rhodes? Rohr. [SIGHS] Okay. So, what can I do for you today? I think I need a scrape. Huh? A what? A short arm inspection. Just read the fucking intake. Oh. Oh. Do you have any symptoms? I think I got a thing. What does your regular physician say? Asshole, if I could go to my regular doctor, would I be here? A confidentiality thing. Should I have to tell you that? Okay, take it out. It's not like I got options. [LAUGHING] Oh, fuck. - Oh, fuck. - Let's go. - [LAUGHING] - Let's go. Come on. Up, up, up. Don't you get your fucking hands on me! - Don't you fucking touch me. - Up. Don't you fucking... Watch this. I go bom-bom. That's what I go. I go bom-bom. No, I go up. - I go... - [BOTH GRUNT] Hey, come on. Get up! [LAUGHS] - Here, you want me to drive? - No. [SIGHS AND PANTS] What are you going to tell her? That you lost the money? Cathy's going to blame you anyways. [LAUGHS] [BLUESY ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] SIOBHAN: Are you done staring at yourself, Decourcy? Now, would you look at that bed in there? I bet that bed is still warm. And I'm still so, so cold. And then there's that body. All that body that could keep me warm. When the reverend asks for testimony, you can say what strength God gave you to resist temptation. [LAUGHS] Guess that'll save me from begging. SIOBHAN: You were too tired last night. Well, that's why I need to be in the bed. - Church will take an hour. - [TAP WATER RUNS] To mourn a drug dealer? We're trying to build a political platform in this community, and we need the reverend. Look at the weight your daddy threw in Brooklyn. I've spent 18 years listening to his bullshit. Pretty sure I earned the right to skip one Sunday morning. SIOBHAN: Bullshit? Like, "My daddy knew King." "My daddy was in Memphis." ♪ My daddy was in... ♪ You know, that's just something I tell the work folks. Anytime you mention Martin Luther King or an abusive parent, they get comfortable. I'm just playing a role they know. Then don't act righteous with me. All right. Reverend Field is my client, and I promised him you'd be there. So I'm really doing you a favor then. Mm-hmm, one that I'll pay back. Oh, you going to pay it back? Mm-hmm. You going to pay it back? Our words matter. CONGREGANTS: Yes. Our actions matter. That's right. Our culture matters. Not just to ourselves and our sense of identity, but to the way in which we are perceived. We are being watched. Constantly. Our errors are scrutinized. Our flaws, magnified. And though the story of this young man before us is tragic, his death is a warning. No policeman did this. No white man did. One of our own. We are killing each other on these streets, and the killing must end. MAN: Yes. Now, the Lord's justice is sure. And though the universe may bend towards that justice... Who the hell is that? - We're in church. - I don't care. I know him from work. REVEREND: ...if we want justice. And we must look to one another. You all pay taxes. You all send your babies to these schools. This is our community. And together, we must all bring the law home. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! They'll kill me! Oh, please, no! - They'll kill me! - [ALL SCREAM] Help me! Help me! [CONGREGANTS SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] [ALL SCREAMING] Go, go. Take her outside. [SIRENS WAILING] [DOORS OPEN] OFFICER: Hey, why do you got your hands up? So there's no mistakes. Was he familiar to you? - What the hell you mean by that? - I didn't mean... What you want me to say? WOMAN: Kayla, he's about to ask... KAYLA: And I told him already. He don't believe me. He thinks I'm lying. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] DECOURCY: Miss Wiley, I work for the district attorney's office. I know it's hard. It's a hard thing to think about. But Siobhan had to answer the same questions. So did I. And the reverend said, "Look to each other." Hmm? I couldn't see their faces. Did you know the deceased? I think I've seen him before. Okay. Let's start there. Hey. That's your mom? I didn't even think of that. Then who are you talking to? Waiting to speak to our congressman. - Siobhan. - He has to hear us now. - He has to do something. - Siobhan, listen to me. - Listen to me. - What? What do you want from me? Just... just... - hey, just give it... - I have to do... ...a minute. I have to do something. Uh... You should trust me. Just breathe, baby. Just breathe. [SIGHS] How is it so easy for you? It's not my first time. Oh, man, but... like that? You know where I grew up. It's okay. It's okay. All right? [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] - [SIREN WAILING] - [DECOURCY SIGHS] [SIREN WAILS] Counsel, are you all right? Where the hell did you come from? How's your wife? Her mom came and got her. Good, then I can buy you a drink. Nah, I got to get back inside. Anyone in there you could talk to? I... I-I had my arms up. Police came, and... I'm in my own church. And I put my arms up instinctively. Well, yeah, that was a smart thing to do. I'd have done the same thing, circumstances were the same. But then again, I look guilty as fuck. So that's what's bugging you, huh? Not something else? Maybe you're right. Maybe it is something else. Maybe I'm upset because when the shooting was over, at triage time, everyone came together... I didn't. I went the other way. [ SIGHS] Look, I mean, you know, you did what you know how to do. You don't think that helped? You don't think you defused things just a little? A couple of terrified cops running into a place that they know they're not wanted, that they don't even belong. And what do they see? A prosecutor. Someone they know that they can talk to. No, you're missing the point. I don't belong to either side. Well, one has to pay at all times, and sometimes one must pay rather dearly for being honest. You know, one of these days I'm going to end up reading Lincoln Steffens. And you're going to have shit to say to me. That's someone else, actually. But my point is this, and bear with it, because I am going to quote someone. If you go to hunt a lion, everyone will join. But you go to hunt a skunk, and you are alone. Now you went after the Boston Police Department. And then you went to work with them. You are alone. Now maybe you expected some natural political base, that neighborhood or the next one over for doing that, but maybe you made some assumptions based on appearances. You got to just know that if you put yourself on the line, which you are, opening up this grand jury case, this job is not going to be easy. Your life is going to get assuredly worse from here on out. Trust me. Hey... you know why I do what I do? I was a kid, right? I saw Bobby Kennedy giving shit to Jimmy Hoffa on a wall of TVs at the window at Lechmere's. You know, I'd forgotten about this. And then somebody reminded me about it. Now, I didn't know who Bobby Kennedy was. I didn't know who his brother was. But here was this kid giving shit to adults. And I wanted to be that. And when his brother got elected, and he was put in charge of the Justice Department, becoming a Kennedy G-man was how my ambition solidified. Well, look at me now. I mean, do I look like one of those New Frontier types, horn-rimmed glasses and a Harvard degree? No. But I know what I am. And I know what I do well. And I know that I couldn't do what you do. Guys like me, we need guys like you. Are you trying to say I'm your Jack Kennedy? Or maybe what your pops was to Martin Luther King. [LAUGHS] What? What? What's funny? My father didn't know King. Hmm. What about the eye? It's obviously genuinely not there. Your father didn't beat it out of you? No. Cancer, like Peter Falk. So, what is this? Some new tactic? Make me feel bad for the poor black boy with cancer? It may be. [BOTH LAUGHING] Well... the bad do understand. The bad understand. [GLASSES CLINK] [TV CHATTER] [SCOFFS] You stupid fuck. You're lucky I didn't just blow your fucking head off. Your ex would have nowhere to sit. Oh, what's the matter? You feeling good tonight? Don't mention my mother. No, she's got the Alzheimer's, right? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, that's too bad. I bet she wishes she could remember the night I gave her. What's the most you ever lost on a bet, Vito? Uh, maybe... 150,000. - On what? - Miracle on Ice. Oh. You bet against America? I don't live in America. I live in Boston. Wasn't that Superfight, huh? Hagler? I look like a sap? I made a killing on Hagler-Leonard. Why? I don't know. You know, I... I was just wondering how much my Super Bowl bet cost you. [CORK POPS] What? Are you gonna play dumb with me now? Oh, Jackie... You don't remember me sitting here beginning of last season, and we were talking about the time that all the Indians stole the Mayflower down in Plymouth. And I said to you, "Fuck them, I'm going to take the Redskins to win the Super Bowl"? Why don't you just ask me for a loan? Save the effort of coming up with all of this bullshit. Because I'm not paying you back. You shit bag. What were the odds? I think I put down five grand at five to one. Fuck you. - Make it four to one then. - Not bad enough. The fucking casinos in Connecticut are killing me. I got to deal with your bullshit too? [MONEY HITS FLOOR] Hey, Vito... give your mother my best. I know I did. [WILLIAM SHATNER, ON TV] At 11:37 p.m. 911 dispatcher Ken Sirotoski took the call. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER OVER TV] Take off your shoes. They're heels, Non. I just washed the fucking floor. Okay, well, you don't have to wash the floors every day. What if I fucking croak tonight? I ain't gonna have people coming in here, despite the rest of you trying, saying I had a filthy house. Non, if you croak, people are going to come in the house, get the floors all dirty. Don't start, you little bitch. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yeah? [WOMAN, ON PHONE] This is O'Rourke residence? - No, wrong number. - Oh, I'm sorry. The Rohr residence? We tried the office, but no answer, and we know he wanted to get these test results right away. - Well, who is this? - The free clinic. We have John Rohr's blood tests back. He is disease-free. - Disease-free? - Blood was clean. No sign of sexually transmitted disease. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [KEYS RATTLE] Ah! Aren't they supposed to play theme music when you're about to appear? Cloud of flying monkeys or something? Keep fucking laughing, idiot. You'll need a sense of humor in your new lonely life. You pig. You don't think anyone knows. But you didn't think to wrap it up. What the fuck are you talking about? Doctor called. The free clinic. So what? I went for an EKG. Bullshit. You got cooties. What did they say? You're infected, you piece of shit. I've been telling my daughter for years that you've got a wandering eyeball, but she was always... You don't tell Jenny nothing. You fucking hear me? You think I'm going to let you infect my kid? You out of your mind? How do you know that she don't got it? How do you know that she didn't give it to me? You think I don't know what goes on in my own house? Joe made this, right? Put that back. This is the Red Baron plane, isn't it? Yeah, it seems... It seems very intricate. You've been treating me like trash since day one. You and him both. And you want to bust your daughter all the time for being clueless, but you got shit that you're never going to want to admit to yourself. You put me in the fucking doghouse, and I'm going to be like Snoopy and blow your shit right the fuck out of the sky. You know me, you bitch. You think I'm going to start fighting fair with you? So, what are you going to do? - You really want to test me? - No, no, no, don't! Come on. Now, you really think that I'm that inhuman? I mean, give me some credit, for Christ's sake. [DOOR SLAMMING] [MELLOW JAZZ PLAYS OVER CAR RADIO] [DOOR SLAMMING] [KNOCKS] You ever going to come out of there? The church. I don't want to hear everybody's questions and concerns. It's a good thing no one likes you then, huh? How's our friend in Fall River? Like you said, Watergate kid was a setup. Was Hannihan just a shit cop, or was he protecting somebody on this? It could be both. This must really dim your faith in the Boston Police Department. DECOURCY: Got to find those bodies. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] Witness changed his statement. Who? Thomas Hayes. See, the night Kinicki disappears, he tells the first detective on scene that he didn't see anything. He says Kinicki went to the bathroom and he never comes back. But he testifies... - He testified? - He testified at trial... that he went to the bathroom with Kinicki. The line was too long, so they go outside. Hayes headed back in, but claims that he saw Kinicki talking to someone in a late-model Caprice. I'm guessing the Portuguese kid... Drove a blue '88 Caprice. But why does Thomas Hayes lie? He wants the kid to go away. These guys don't cooperate with police, yet he'll perjure himself? What's Hayes' jacket like? [SCOFFS] I mean, nothing your typical Charlestown choirboy wouldn't do. Assault and battery. Mayhem. No time served. They'll probably run him for Congress. I need some good news. What's what with the Kinicki case? Tommy Hayes. You know him? Uh... - No. Charlestown guy? - Yeah. - He's a little younger than you. - The family name is familiar, but what's the rap sheet look like? Nothing too serious, given the context. Let me see what I can do. [PHONE BEEPS] Cocksucker, I need you fucks to earn a living today, all right? Go fuck yourself. Pull up file on a Thomas Hayes, no middle name, social is 050-24-8674. Well, don't ask me what I'm looking for. Just tell me about him. You know, was he married? Does he have kids? What's he do for a living? Does he own his house? If so, how long? Is he on welfare? Has he ever been on welfare? You know what the fuck to do. Oh, what's that? What you giving me that look for? Decourcy Ward gets his hands dirty. Huh. Uh-huh. You know Lincoln Steffens? - No. - Stick around. JACKIE: All right, Thomas Hayes is a part-time roofer. His wife don't work. No government assistance. Yet he own a triple-decker right off of Monument Avenue. RACHEL: Does he rent out the other two floors? - JACKIE: Nope. - [CHUCKLES] Inflation's at 3%. Last year, 4. So how does Tommy Hayes from Charlestown own his own home? HAYES: Should I have a lawyer here? DECOURCY: That's up to you. RACHEL: Do you feel you need one, Mr. Hayes? What do you want to talk about? DECOURCY: Kelly Kinicki. Yeah? What did you think we were here on? HAYES: I don't know. I was confused. You want to tell us what happened? [KIDS CHATTERING UPSTAIRS] I went on record back then. Well, you mind telling me what happened? It was a long time ago. DECOURCY: Just do the best you can. [CHILDREN'S SHOUTING INTENSIFIES] Shut up! Please! Last time I saw Kelly, I don't know, four years ago? Um... night the power went off in the Garden, Stanley Cup. I sat next to him at the bar. Kelly got up, he never came back. Hmm. Did you see anything unusual that night? I'd have done something if I had. Like find who disappeared him? Yeah, sure. Like the man in the blue Caprice? You remember that detail? So I do need a lawyer, don't I? Thank you for your time, Mr. Hayes. [LAUGHS ] Enough for a subpoena. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. You got a set of balls on you, huh? It ain't canapé with you. - I pick my spots. - [LAUGHS] Excuse me, where are the avocados? Nah, we don't carry those. Sorry. Do you ever? They're too expensive. No one seems to buy them. - Really? - Yeah. They're great, though, right? But one time we had them, and they just rotted on the shelves. You're not going to find any around here. You can try Back Bay. - WOMAN: Thanks. - Yeah. Listen, I gotta get a lawyer. - What, you get a DUI? - Yeah, I wish. Some cops came to my house. Not about that. It's about our dear, dear friend. What'd you say? Tommy. I changed my statement back then. So we'll get you a lawyer. Right? [SIGHS] Sorry, Frank. Mm-hmm, yeah. Big question is, why the fuck are they bringing up Kinicki now? BENNIE: Why do you ever need a car? It's not like you have a life. JENNY: I can't trust you. All you think about is boys. BENNIE: You love doing this to me. JENNY: No, you just don't listen. No, you're just a fucking bitch! - All right, all right. - Fine, you handle this. Hey, what are you antagonizing for? Because she keeps bringing up the car. She keeps throwing it in my face. All right, do you really think we're not getting you a car? Do you think we want you haunting this place like Non? Huh? What started the fight? - Was it a boy, or multiple boys? - Jesus, Dad. Listen, I don't care what you do. Just be smart about it. Just don't be one of those one that comes home crying because she thought the guy loved her. Whatever. I love you too. If you ever talked to me like that, I'd have slapped your little ass. - JENNY: Not now, Ma. - And then he comes in and plays the hero. If your father were alive... JENNY: Ah. Oh, good. God punished you. For what? What are you so agitated about tonight? Why are you starting now, huh? You need to get laid. Ma! When was the last time? Are-Are you drunk right now, huh? Tell me I'm wrong. When? [SIGHS] A while ago, okay? - How long? - Why are you doing this? Oh, what do you think the hero has been doing that whole time? - That's none of your business. - Oh, you suddenly turned saint? What is this, Ma? Huh? What? You don't want to see, don't listen to me, fine. But listen when I tell you, start saving your own money. Put a little away here, there. And then if something happens, you're not left sitting in the dark with an unpaid electric bill. [PEOPLE MURMURING] Hey. How are you? Oh, you know. Getting there. You? Same. I kept you a seat. Didn't realize you were bringing Decourcy tonight, or I'd have saved two. "Decourcy"? That's a little familiar. Take my seat. I'll take the back. Thank you. Okay. For years, I have said it's a matter of responsibility. Of taking the responsibility upon ourselves. That isn't logical, Reverend. You said last Sunday, God have mercy, that there are people who should be held to account. There are people who must be held to account. And we have with us tonight a member of the Suffolk County prosecutor's office. Mr. Ward. Before you took the job you have now, you were a part of the St. Clair Commission. A review of the Boston Police Department in the wake of the Charles Stuart debacle? Yeah. I fought to be there. And what did that accomplish? Well, you... you asking me, or...? Nothing. You accomplished nothing. I recommended jail time for cops. - Did those police get jail time? - No, but if you're talkin'... A prosecutor is responsible for choosing which cases - make it to trial. - Given the facts. Not emotions. Facts. REVEREND: The prosecutor chooses which cases are baseless and which accusations are racist. But you tend to chase the cases that get the most headlines. Come on, keep going. This is exactly what white people want us to do. Pull down when one of us is ahead. I was there Sunday. And started acting in an official capacity. Well, I wasn't hiding. Because you'd have nothing to fear from police charging in, because they'd recognize you, house nigger. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYS] [KEYS CLATTER] Hello? ["DAMN I WISH I WAS YOUR LOVER" BY SOPHIE B. HAWKINS PLAYS] [LAUGHS] Oh. I thought I had more time. What, is your boyfriend coming over or something? I was getting fancy, you know? Jesus. This song is fucking filthy. ♪ You'll beg and then you'll go away... ♪ That's all you have to say? That's all you have to say right now? What? What do you want me to say? Oh, well, how about, "Wow, Jen, you look great"? You know you do. What am I to you, huh? Am I just a live-in nurse now? Huh? Is that it? What are you talking about? You don't touch me. Hon, I've been busy. You know how long it's been? How long what? Since we fucked, Jackie. Oh, well, why are you talking like that? Why are you changing the subject? What's the matter with you? You got a guilty conscience or something? Conscience about what? No, uh-uh. No. Then fuck me. ♪ Don't need a doctor to feel much better ♪ Fuck me right now. Fuck me like you used to. ♪ Forever and ever and ever and ever... ♪ I still don't feel great. - [JEN MUTTERING] - Oh! Ho ho! [SIGHS] Fuckin' song. [TURNS MUSIC OFF] [JENNY, SOBBING] Oh, God. [SIGHS] I think we know enough to say with some certainty that New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the Comeback Kid. [CROWD CHEERS] Ah, fuck. [PHONE RINGS] Yeah? [DECOURCY, ON PHONE] Did I wake you? No. No, I'm just... sitting here, staring at the fat fucking face of the future. What are you, a Republican? [JACKIE LAUGHS] No, I voted for Carter once. I was so ashamed, I never voted again. [DECOURCY LAUGHS] Ah. [SNIFFLES] It's getting to you, huh? What's that? What they call the loneliness. The man that makes his own rules. I just want to hit back. At who specifically? Too many to name. [SIGHS] Pazienza e coraggio. Old Nanna used to say that. "Patience. Courage." Waitin'. ♪ Don't stop ♪ ♪ It'll soon be here ♪ SIOBHAN: Hello, Reverend Walker. The initiative is called the Genesis Coalition. It's a community-based organization to end the violence in... [DOOR BUZZER] Hold on one second. Yes? JACKIE: Hey, how are you? Jackie Rohr. My husband's not home. Actually, I'm here to see you. Your husband is not an easy read. He don't say a lot, which is good, because I tend to talk too much, but I can see that he's upset. This is not an accusation. It's just a question. He would never tell me something that was, you know, going on with the two of you. And you expect me to? I just want to be able to help him, that's all. How's that? Well, I know that you both have ideas about where he could go. So do I. And those are? Anywhere he wants. Mayor. Governor. You think that's a possibility? Look, I got no reason to bullshit you. If I didn't think there was something in this for me, I wouldn't be sitting here asking you for a favor. And what's that? Don't push him. You could tell me to fuck right off right now, but your husband does not need to be involved with this church shooting thing in Roxbury. Black people, they're gonna like him no matter what. He's like Sidney Poitier. They hear that song "In the Heat of the Night" in their heads, they see him coming. I don't care what some shit bum Baptist has to say. What Decourcy needs is for white people to trust him and the job that he's doing. Now, he manages to put away a couple of Charlestown bank robbers... How is that going to make them like him? Because it'll show that he doesn't give a fuck. That he will do his job. That's what people around here care about. Professionalism. - I'm from around here. - Mm-hmm. And you're a lawyer. So don't go acting like you don't know what I'm talking about. What are you, paying rent here now or what? You would begrudge me some yellow cheese and two slices of toast, huh? No, just like I didn't begrudge you the ten grand you lost gambling. - Oh. - CATHY: "Oh". "Oh"? Yeah, look at me right now. You are not getting another fucking dime of that money. - You understand me? - Is that why you think I'm here? You think I'm haunting you for money? - I didn't say that. - Yeah? Well... There's a lot going on, Jimmy. And what the fuck did I do? Nothing. But you tend to remind people of things - they don't need reminding of. - Like who? Kick? Did she say that? CATHY: Oh, what, is shock you, you bother people? - Fuck you, Cathy. - FRANKIE: Hey. Tommy got questioned about Kinicki. All right? People are looking into what happened. Did Tommy get subpoenaed? CATHY: He expects to be. Does Tommy have a lawyer? How the fuck could he afford that, huh? So you gave him the money? You gave Tommy the fucking money? CATHY: Oh, hey, Tommy doesn't cause his fucking problems. JIMMY: Fuck you! Fuck you both, huh. CATHY: Yeah, get the fuck out of here. Fuck it. Fuck it. [SIGHS] [MUTTERING] Fuck! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] [SIGHS] [PANTING] [GASPS] [BEEPER BEEPING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER CAR RADIO] - It was worth it. - Yeah? Yeah, your Ebb Tide tip checked out. Now, where the fuck is the armored car, Jimmy? Clay Marsh, near the bait shop. Hmm. Hey, what's the most you ever lost on a bet? That's easy. Hagler. Yeah? I guess everyone lost on that fucking fight, huh? - Yeah. You too? - Yup. Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Did everything he could, but the fix was in. There was nothing he could do. Beat Leonard's brains in and he still lost the fucking fight. Hey, let that be your worst loss, Jimmy. There's only, like, 18 grand here. [LAUGHS] You forget what state you're living in? Tax is a bitch. [FOGHORN BLOWING] [COPS CHATTERING] Must bring back memories, huh, Hank? Friday night in Nantasket Beach, boosting a car to get home. - MICHAELA: Did you do that? - HANK: Of course. Everyone did. Uh-uh. I was busy collecting for UNICEF. - The fuck you did. - [ALL CHUCKLE] DECOURCY: That's our truck. You see that? I'm not always full of shit. Hey! Watch it! - [SPITS] - Oh! - Oh, fuck me! [LAUGHS] - DECOURCY: Oh, shit.
