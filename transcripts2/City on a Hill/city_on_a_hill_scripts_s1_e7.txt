 - Call an ambulance. - Hey, did you see that? Is she breathing? Jackie. Mornin'. You need to go. You said you wanted me here. Yeah. Now I want you to leave. Ow. Wait, J... Jen. Bennie's coming home from the hospital today. Seeing us side by side

 would be important for her right now. Okay. Yeah, we can go pick her up together. Uh... She don't want you there. That's what she said. No... Jen, give her a break. She's been through a lot. Jen, she's... Never seen you here before noon. A little early for a nightcap. - Hey, what's in the file? - Tax records for the Ebb Tide, for a meeting with Hook's lawyer. You're not going to find shit in those tax records.

 Well, how will I know if I don't look? Between the office and Winter Hill, the money trail don't work. That reporter, Michaela Freda. What does she got against you? Why do you ask? She was poking around with a lot of questions, disrupting my day. Well, bad things happen to good people, and finally something shitty has happened to a shitty person. She's in a coma. Tripped and fell down a flight of concrete stairs. Tripped or pushed? She was a victim of karma. Sometimes you're just going along with your stupid, meaningless life, and totally out of the blue everything goes your way. So there is a problem between you and her. Not no more. She's in a coma, and Jackie's smiling. That... that doesn't seem inappropriate to you? For Jackie Rohr? Sounds about right. Well, Michaela asked me questions about Jackie, she asked you questions about Jackie. I mean, she must be onto something. Or she was onto something. Did she approach you? Mm-hmm. Hello? I'm just wondering who else she interviewed. Okay, look, I... I don't think you're gonna have any trouble keeping up with Hook's dollar-store lawyer. I'd rather work too hard than not hard enough. I totally agree. Mr. Ward. Seth Golden, Scott Hook's lawyer. So everybody buys booze on the weekends, right? Right? Mondays, the armored car, it goes from... from store to store in... in Fall River, picking up the deposits, right? And it has to hit at least a dozen Pakis, right? There's gotta be six zeroes in the back of that thing fuckin' easy. Now here's the best part. The last stop... pulls into a parkin' lot of some wholesaler. Quick in and out, shit-ton of cash. It's not a bad plan. Yeah, fuckin' right. Hymie, how's your hymen? Yeah, fuck you. Hey, how you doing? - Yo, Jimbo. - How you been? I can't accept any more of your stolen food stamps as payment. Oh, come on, I don't do that shit no more, okay? - I'm a grown-up. - Yeah, whatever. - Fuck you. - Yeah, your mother. Hey, Frankie, you remember... you remember when I was 11 years old, and I outgrew my skates, and Dad couldn't afford to buy another pair, and I wasn't going to play... Play Little Bruins that year? You remember that? And you went to M&M; Sporting Goods, and you... you fuckin' stole me a pair of skates 'cause... you knew how much I wanted to play, and fuckin' hockey was the only fuckin' thing I was good at. Why you going down memory lane right now? I just... I owe you a lot, that was all. - Open the drawer. - Whoa, whoa! Easy, man. Shut the fuck up and open the drawer. Okay, okay. Opening the drawer. - Hurry the fuck up! - Okay, I'm going! Whoa! Okay, stop. Frank, stop! He's down! Stop, for Christ's sake! Fuck you! - Thanks a lot. - Have a good day. Oh, my God! Cathy. How are ya? - Uh... - Oh! Yeah, my mother-in-law's, uh... She's upstairs. Oh, poor Dottie. - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll go later, say hi. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm just going to grab some, um... Eh, some stuff. - Yeah. - Just real quick. How you been? Some days I almost forget. But now with the grand jury, it's all coming back. I can't get out of bed for crying. Yeah, it must be hard to see the name Kinicki back in the newspaper. After four years, I should be handling this better, right? At least for Miles. Kid's been through shit and back. Babsie, y-you can't help feeling how you feel. Right? Yeah, losing Kelly was a... was a real awful thing for you and Miles to go through. I can't imagine. I'll sit here and argue all day. I enjoy a good fight. Even so, by sunset, you'll still have nothing more than the gun traffickers and the pleasure of my company. We aren't after the traffickers. I repeat, Mr. Hook has zero to say about any armored car guards, alive or dead. I wonder what he'll say when he's facing a grand jury like his buddies, Hayes and Sheehan. I wonder what he'll suddenly remember. You seem like a good man, Mr. Ward. A wise man. So tell me, what's more important? Cutting off the flow of guns into our great city, making the streets safer? Or finding out which poor blue-collar Boston kid robbed an avaricious bank? Three people are dead. So, both. Both are important. A little progress is better than no progress. You, sir, are obsessed with winning the entire war. You want to ride into Rome on a chariot wearing a laurel. You stick to telling me your thoughts. I am well aware of my own. Thank you for coming in. I want to set bail. A million dollars. And fuck you too. How does a Charlestown bartender afford a Harvard Jew? I don't... I don't know. Look, Hook is the best chance that we have at nailing whoever killed those guards. - So what do you want to do? - Throw the book at him. Pick that book up and throw it again. You think that serves justice better? Whose side are you on? You and Siobhan, that Genesis Coalition thing you've been working on, trying to get guns off the street. We arrest the traffickers, we dry up the flow. Maybe you do get a chariot ride. Benedetta's due home from the hospital. I am so scared I'm going to say the wrong thing. - Aww. - So... I bought this hoping, uh, you know, it might make things a little less awkward. It's pretty. But let me save you the suspense, Jen. You're going to say the wrong thing. But so what? What could be worse than what already happened? Look, I piss her off, she runs out of the house, but this time, hey, she doesn't come home. No, she ends up, uh, dead in a ditch somewhere. Yeah. Always the optimist, huh? Oh, God, Sue, I envy you and your daughter's relationship so much. Yeah, right. You remember when... Eve had an "internship" in Rancho Mirage? Yeah. She was at the Betty Ford Clinic. Cocaine. Mountains of that shit. Sue, why didn't you tell me, huh? Embarrassment. Maybe even denial. Neither of which solve anything. Okay. So, what does? Listen to your daughter. Be there for her. Tell her you understand, whether you do or not. Or be quiet. I learned that the fuckin' hard way. The fuckin' hellish way. You can't say the wrong thing if your mouth is shut. Your honesty coming forward made a difference. Reverend Fields has been removed from the Genesis Coalition. He's no longer the pastor of our church. He's attending mandatory sexual rehabilitation, and, listen, he's not going to be able to hurt anyone else without serious consequences. Hmm. What serious consequences? Like counseling? Well... Um... Adrienne, what is your idea of justice? It's not this. W-What would you like to happen? Jail. Thinking about that man fearing for his body, the same way he made girls feel. That's the only good thing that could get done. Yeah, but as you know, - charging him is impossible. - Oh, right. So, what you trying to give me, a consolation prize? He was my reverend. You got a husband. Got this big apartment. That ain't the way for everybody. I grew up in that church. My mom, grandma and the APC were my support, you understand? Fields took that from me. Then why did you come to my office, son in tow, and tell your story? I wanted to forgive Fields. To live by those Christian rules. But that motherfucker, he never said sorry. So I don't forgive. Would you like to see him? Hear an apology face-to-face? I mean, he can write a letter. Like something you make a kid do? - Adrienne, work with me. - I'm out of here. Nothing's gonna make that better. Thank you. How you feeling? Ready to go home? Answer me or don't, but, uh... where did you get the drugs? - A guy. - Yeah? What guy? Did Dr. Morrison talk to you about drug counseling? - Yeah. - And? Sure. How come you didn't want your ma to come? Nah, it's all right. Listen, forget it, forget it. - No, no, I'm just... - No. No... I just... I'm afraid of what she'll say. You know, if she sees me like this. - Oh... - All mangled. Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. Oh... You're still our little girl... Ben-drops. Daddy, what if I never get better? What if I don't ever feel the same? No, no, shh, shh, shh. Hey, you will. You're a fighter. You're my daughter. You'll fight. You want me to push you fast? I'll push you fast. You want slow, we go slow. Come on. There we go. What'd I tell you? As discussed, my client will give you the names of the arms dealers. I know you know who killed those armored truck guards. Are you really willing to bet on that? Trying to tie guns found in Roxbury to dead guards in Revere? Where's your witness testimony? Where are the bodies? You grand jury my client on a hunch, and Decourcy Ward becomes a punch line. As I said, a wise man. Brian Tompkins, Jerry Somarko. Brian Tompkins, Jerry Somarko. I don't recognize either name. How the fuck did they escape my radar? Maybe they're new to the game. Or good at what they do and quick to exterminate rats. Okay, so we raid a... row house off of University Ave. Hidin' in plain sight. Not the worst idea. Kept them off your radar. Kenmore Square, here we come. ["Nothing Else Matters" by Metallica playing over jukebox] ♪ Trust I seek and I find in you ♪ ♪ Every day for us something new ♪ ♪ Open mind for a different view ♪ ♪ And nothing else matters ♪ Something you want to tell us? Nope. You want something from me, ask. - I want to make a buy. - No, you don't. You're a businessman, aren't you? I ain't ending up in front of a grand jury for either one of yous. How do you avoid it so far? I told them I don't know nothing. Good. Just want to buy some guns. No. A time and a place. I got a family. I got bills. Yeah, we all got families, Frank. ♪ And nothing else matters ♪ Ah, fuck him. I leave you alone for five fuckin' minutes, and you screw the pooch. I decided to make a deal with Hook. I'm standing by my decision. You came to me with this case! Three dead bank guards, all right? You're forgetting. You said to me... And I'm going to quote you... "I want to rip out the fucked-up machinery in this city." These guards are the start. But you veer off now to gun trafficking... We don't even have the bodies that you promised. Not yet. We will. You know what I care about? Two hundred-plus homicides a year, okay? I take down these two snakes that are bringing guns into Boston, maybe some kids get to live to see age 20. I knew you were an idealist, but I never knew you were naive. The tides are turning, Jackie. For the first time, I'm seeing a coordinated effort in this city. The... the ministers, the professional people, the mayor's office, the... The community is engaged. White cops are working with us, not banging our heads against the p... police cruisers, or letting the dogs loose... You need a bigger soapbox, though, for your Southern Poverty Law fantasies. But... But you don't want to be the guy standing in front of city hall preaching about righteousness and justice - I do. I do. - Rolling down like waters. I do, okay? I do want justice for all. That doesn't make me naive, Jackie. It puts me on the right side of the future. Well, I may be an anachronism, but I ain't going anywhere. You know what? I wanna do what's right, okay, not chase some fuckin' headlines in the Globe. All right, so... you solve this Revere case. And, sure, I get my name in the paper. But so... do... you. And maybe down the line you run for mayor, actually make a difference. Come on. T... They don't wander off. Finish this one with me. Is that your new approach? Ah. Heartfelt. Fuck you! Fine, fine, go ahead. Chase the fuckin' guns. I'll solve the murder of those guards. - There you are. So... - You know what? I-I can't tell if you're just a scumbag, or... or if your self-interest is so all-encompassing that you actually believe the bullshit that you spew. Trust me, nobody gives a shit about a bunch of dead black kids. No, Jackie, you don't give a shit about a bunch of dead black kids. Hey. Welcome home. Why are you giving me that? Just want me to feel even more like a piece of shit? No. W-Why would I do that? Come on. Pretty. Thanks. If you, uh... If you want to talk, I'm here to listen. You want to tell me I'm just like Dad. That actions have consequences. All that shit. I know you don't want to hear this, but, uh... right now the only person you're reminding me of is me. There's a lot of stuff I... I never told ya. I've been hurt. And you want my sympathy? I thought this was supposed to be the other way around, where you're telling me that I'm going to be okay. I... I might not know exactly what happened, and I-I don't need to know right now, or ever if you don't want. But please trust me when I say... I know how lonely you feel. But even though you're lonely, you're not alone. I love ya. Always. I'll be one of those girls comes home crying because the boy doesn't love you. What, your father say this? Hey, that's not what this is, Bennie. I'm just so stupid, you know? I don't know why. I just... I thought that Clay was different. I don't know why. I mean, I'm smarter than that. - I don't know why I just... - You're not stupid, okay? And this is not your fault. Nothing you could ever do could make you deserve this. And I'm going to help ya. Okay? Anything you need... I'm here. This question is for Donna. Uh, what was sex like before you got married? Uh... Uh, it was very, very good... Oh. It was a yo-yo. Look who finally decided to come visit her ailing grandma. Just what the doctor should have ordered, except my doctor happens to be a quack. Come here, baby. Come on. Hey, you can hug her. She won't break. That's okay. I wouldn't want to hug this old pile of bones either. Why don't you take Kick downstairs, get her a Snickers bar. I need to get some rest now. Yeah. Come on, kiddo. You name it, we've got it. Our new inventory is coming in fast, so these cars have got to go. - Babsie. - Hey. That's a handsome lunch date you got there. Yeah, he's all right. Hello, Mrs. Ryan. Hi. Kick. Say hi to Mrs. Kinicki and Miles. Hey. Sorry. She's just worried about her grandma, that's all. Yeah, we understand. Don't we? I'm not hungry. See you at school, Miles. Hey, Kick... I'm sorry about that. Kick, come on. Don't go far, huh? You know why she's acting like this, right? The nightmares. Kinicki. Jesus Christ. You know, I'm starting to think that maybe telling her the truth is the best thing to do for her. It's gonna help her. When did the truth ever help anyone? Look, right now, all she's afraid of is her nightmares. Don't tell that girl her worst fears are true. She'll find that out soon enough. Just let her be a kid a little while longer. Thank y... Thank you so much. Thank you. Ah. What can I do for you, detective? Good guess. No, it's just 15 years as a reporter. Um... Michaela Freda. I need her notes. W-Whatever she was working on before she literally fell into a coma. Well, police said the fall was an accident. Yeah, yeah. This is for a different investigation. Well, you show me that warrant, and I'll be happy to get those notes together for you. A warrant? I hand you the notes, you see some information you don't like, you go warn your cop brothers or sisters. Couldn't possibly happen, right? Okay... I read something that seems credible... I help you finish what she started. Michaela has a lot of friends, but she also has a lot of enemies. It's a by-product of grab-'em-by-the-balls journalism. So since I don't know you, those notes stay exactly where they are until a judge tells me otherwise. You don't have her notes, do you? Pass it over here! Shoot! Yes! Bring the ball over here! Come on, come on, come on. Shoot the ball! Shoot it. Yeah, come on, shoot it! Yes! Miles. Sorry about your dad. Why are you sorry? I'm just sorry he's gone. I bet you feel scared. Come on, Kinicki. Throw the ball. Come on! We're playing a game. Get off the court, bitch. Pass it over here! Pass it to... Here, pass it over here! Hey, Miles, gimme that ball. Whoa! She's got a fucking knife! Kick, what are you doing?! Miles's dad Kelly and my husband were very close before... before Miles lost his dad. That hit us all really hard. So why pick a fight with Miles? Did this boy do something to you? Not really. Well, he said mean stuff. But I feel sorry for him. Every time I see him, I get sad. Sad for him? About his dad? Makes you worried about your own dad? I get it. It's hard not to be frightened when something bad happens, right? Like you see the lightning, and then you're waiting for the thunder. But your dad, he's healthy? He has to work a lot. He's always tired. He must have a stressful job. What's he do? Works at Purity Supreme. He's the produce manager. Is that where you got the utility knife? To protect myself. My family. Hi. I'll take over from here. Look, this is a juvenile case... Are you questioning a superior officer? You did good, Internacola. Now go. Oh, Bernie, thank God. Catherine, can you wait outside? Give me and your mom a minute? Really? Frank's got enough problems right now. She can't be drawing attention. You need to talk to her. What, you don't think I've tried? If Kick wound up in the hands of the wrong cop, they'd be filing a subpoena as we speak. Get your fuckin' house in order. The whole thing's ridiculous. Freud wants to study perverts, he should look in the mirror. When Freud said "perversion," he wasn't using the word judgmentally. - Right, Professor Yoshimora? - Right. He was talking about behavior outside of what was socially acceptable in his time. Still, plenty of psychologists rolled their eyes at penis envy. Same with the Oedipus complex. Critics of Freud find that preposterous. Some even say that he forced this idea of childhood sexual fantasies onto his patients. Was the trauma which those children revealed imagined or real? Miss Rohr, your thoughts? Jenny? Oh, we... we get frisked to buy guns now? You heard of trickle-down economy? It's like that. Trickle-down anxiety. Got to be honest, with the amount of grand jury surrounding your people, I shouldn't be talking to you. So I'm guessing your price is significantly higher. Eight hundred for pistols, a grand for anything larger. Ah, fuck you. Jimmy. Three of the handguns and four of the others. You'll have them Friday. Hi, you've reached the Rohr residence. Please leave your name and number. - Yeah, hello? - Scum fuck. Jeez, my day was going so well. Any idea where Jimmy Ryan is? Up shit's creek, where he always is. I mean specifically. His ma is in Boston City. Maybe he's being a good son. Yeah. Emptying her bedpan. - Yeah. All right, talk to ya... - All right. Nurse Pappendreo to ICU. - Nurse Pappendreo to ICU. - Hi, can I help you? I'm looking for Michaela Freda. Um, she's a patient. Dr. Westpaul. Dr. Westpaul to admitting, please. Dr. Westpaul to admitting. Thank you. Dr. Fiscus... Dr. Fiscus to the ER. Hi. I'm, uh... I'm-I'm Rachel. Tess. I'm her sister. - Oh. - You're a friend? I don't know if she'd think of me as one. I didn't know her well... um, but my boyfriend got gunned down. Eighty-four. Oh, the North End story? Yeah. That's the one. And, um, she sat with me the whole night. You... you been here long? Uh, since she checked in. Well, have you eaten? Slept? No. No, I can't bear to leave her alone. Look, why don't you go to the cafeteria, grab something? They got a fish dish that's pretty good, you know? - I'll... I'll sit with her. - I don't know, I'm... I used to be a nurse. She is not waking up anytime soon. Well... okay. Yeah? I won't be long. Oh, please, take your time. What you working on? Okay. Michaela Freda didn't just talk to you, me, and Rohr. She interviewed an FBI agent named Clasby and a drug addict named Roach. Clay Roach. Okay, fuck just being a scumbag. Your pal Jackie Rohr... he might be a felon. Did you get proof? She's got dots. Say hi to grandma. - Babies. - Grandma! Come gimme some love. Mwah. Mwah. You see how sick I have to be just to get a visit outta you guys? Dottie, no, I'm not around. Mm-hmm. I just like to cause a little trouble anyway. You know, you never married Jimmy, but you're still my favorite daughter-in-law. How was your flight from Florida? - Fun! - Yeah? We got free peanuts. Mm, yum. Daddy's going to be here soon. He better not be. He promised. Oh, come on, you're not going to come all this way and not let the kids see their father. That's exactly what I'm going to do. Don't you guys miss Daddy? Dot, come on. You know what? There's a waiting room down the hall, and in there there's a jar of lollipops. - Can we, Mom? - Please? Sure. Bring me back one too. Me and Jimmy... I know we can be a bit much. Right? I know that. But when we love, we love hard. All he cares about is you and those girls. That's all he thinks about. All he ever thinks about is getting high. I know he screws up. But you never have to go a day in your life and wonder if he loves you. You know he'd die for you. You know he would. - Can you get the red one? - I want the green one. - I want the purple one. - I want the purple one. Get the green one for me. - Can I get... - I got it! Psst! - Daddy! - How are you, my darlings? How are you doing, baby? How are you? - Good. - You look so pretty. - I like your bow. - Thank you. How are you sweetie? How you doing? Got your sucker? Mom said we weren't going to see you. Huh? Well, we don't have to tell Ma, now, do we? Okay? It'll be our secret, okay? - Why? - Hmm? - She won't tell. - No, you're not going to tell. I got another secret for you. You got to come here to hear it, though. How's that for a secret? I got a secret for you too. Hey, girls. Back to your grandma. Bye, Meagan. Bye, Nik. The FBI, where are you hiding them this time? I knew you wouldn't stay away. Yeah, because I can't keep a promise. Yeah, which is why I never asked you to say "I do." Yeah. I wanted to, though. Does that count? Your mom's going to be okay. She's too angry at life to die. Mr. Ryan? Dr. Cohen wants to see you now. What the fuck? My family is crawling all over this place. They see us together, I'm fucked, you're fucked. We're all fucked. What, they don't love you unconditionally? Alive, for now. What do you want? Nothing. You said to me that you were going to show me where those three dead bank guards were. You didn't. I gave you chance after chance, and now I am done with you forever. I'm sick of all your lies. I'm sick of all your bullshit. I'm done doing all the giving in this give-and-take. Fuck you. I gave you plenty. I-I-I gave you the fucking... I gave you the Ebb Tide, the armored truck. It's my fault you can't add two and two... You're breaking up, Jimmy. Burn the mix tapes. Burn the fuckin' love letters. From now on whatever you do, you pay full price, and pay you must assuredly will. What if I'm not done with you, huh? What if I feel like talking to someone? Like maybe The Herald. And I tell them all the shady shit that you done. Hmm? All that shit that you see me do, that was my good side. Do you really want to see my bad side? The bad side that likes revenge? Tell you what, how about I swing by your brother's house and pay your kids a little visit? You know all the shit I've done? Then you know the shit that I will do. Then we should have no problem making a clean break. Going our own ways. You came here to tell me that? Like you said, I know what you can do. So, what's the latest version? I know you're running through the raid on the arms dealers in your head. So, what do you see? Dragged-out firefight. Lose one cop, maybe two. Lawsuits will follow. I'll get demoted. Back to prosecuting adult misdemeanors. You've been up for a while, huh? Oh, come on, baby, you can get a couple more hours of sleep. Mm-mmm. I go back to bed, I'll lie there thinking about you not sleeping. If you're going to worry... we're going to worry together. ♪ So come up close ♪ ♪ And don't be square ♪ ♪ You wanna battle me any... ♪ Police! Show me your hands! - Get them up! - Show me your hands! You can't just come in here. You... you can't touch us. What, do you want to go on trial for police brutality? No one will believe white cops beat up white kids. How do you know I'm white? Do yourself a favor, Jerry. Shut the fuck up. You don't know who you're dealing with, man. Stone-cold killers. You think we got false information? I don't know. What do you think? Yeah. See, now this? This I can toast to. Brian Tompkins and Jerry Somarko are in for a rude awakening. What do you think's going to happen? Uh, well, section E. They serve up to 20. Twenty? I-If you can link them. I mean, that's if. You're only linking under the three guns that you recovered. There were no guns at the house. Why... Why... Why do you think homicides are rising in the city? Oh please, don't... Don't give me that shit, okay? These kids aren't the ones pulling the trigger. They run a website. They're dumb-shit computer geeks. So, what's their sentence going to be? Well, we're not jamming up the courts with a couple of brokers and a distribution case. Two years, suspended sentence. Jeez, who's their rabbi? They're college kids with no priors. Stop. Stop talking to me like a civilian. Tompkins's father is a VP at the Red Cross. And Somarko's mother is on the city council. Oh. These, uh, silver-spoon gangsters get a slap on the wrist while kids die because of what these two clowns have done? You know if they were black they'd be on their way to Walpole right now. Is it fair that Tompkins' and Somarko's parents are... are powerful people? No. But you lock up their kids, the parents lose the public trust, they lose their jobs. You know, all the good that George Tompkins does goes down the toilet. And Councilwoman Somarko, Christ, she's on our side. There are no fuckin' sides, Ray. Oh, Jesus. You know, I... I've got a job to do. You may think I'm a company man, but this is a political office. So this little bust of yours, it stays out of the papers. End of story. Go home, pop that cork, put on some Al Green and make a baby. Take a victory lap. Bird playing? Yup. The Great White Hope is in effect. I just want to watch the game, forget about everything else. Yeah, go ahead. Then again, I know that you can't resist my magnetism. And what? One question. Who from the BPD can we pair with Rory? He's one of the... Used to be one of the H-block kids. He wants to work with us. Uh... Uh, Chris... Chris Caysen. Uh, Youth Strike Force. Youth Strike Force? That doesn't sound like community policing. That sounds like cops busting doors and cracking heads. I... I know, I know. But Chris, a lieutenant detective, he's a good guy. Hmm. Yeah, a black man running the operation. That's progress. Uh... What, you want to send a white strike force into Roxbury? Mmm. I mean, they... They're not all white. Okay. You go ahead with your, uh, color-blind sort of justice. Just don't set the coalition up to fail. Give Chris a chance. I believe in him. And there's not many I do. Hey, um... D-Do you think I made the wrong decision going after the guns? You're a pragmatist. You made the only case you could have made. No, I had a choice. The bartender, guilty as sin. Maybe a grand jury would have seen that. Yeah, but, what? He still would have been going to trial for a gun charge. But he... he was the last link, all right? Whoever had the guns before Hook sold them to those kids in Jamaica Plain, that's who killed those guards. And I just... I fell for this same damn trap. Give yourself a little credit. You still stopped a lot of people from bringing dangerous weapons into Boston. Not even. They're white. They're connected. They're all but walking. The laws are like spiderwebs. They'll catch the poor and the weak. But be torn to pieces by the rich and the powerful. Come... Why... why do they always gotta yell louder for Bird? Wh... Hmm. - Want out of the rain? - This is fun! Come on, come on. There they are. Pride of Boston. I'm not fuckin' with his kids. Did I say fuck with his kids? You fuck with his car. You fuck with his girlfriend. I don't give a shit. We're trying to put a scare into Jimmy. When we were kids, Jackie, and your house burned, now I understand why your ma struck that match. "Then Hansel jumped out like a bird from his cage when the doors opened. 'Now we must be off. 'We must get out of the witch's forest, ' he said. 'These are far better than pebbles, ' said Hansel." You're talking to the stove? No, I was... I was... You know, it's just it's a little lonesome out here on the range. "As they walked, the forest seemed more and more familiar to them. Until they saw, from afar, their father's house." Did you have fun at Julia's? There's a man in Uncle Jimmy's car. What did you say? There's a man in Uncle Jimmy's car. What are you going to do? Why don't you go to your room. Don't go out there, Daddy. Don't go out there. Everything's gonna be fine, you understand? Go on. What are you, drunk? What are you doing? Or did you just get into the wrong car by mistake? I'm in the right car, shithead. Oh. So my father was right about you. You're just a fuckin' idiot. ♪ Suspenseful music ♪ Mom, finish the story. "They ran, rushed into the parlor, and they threw themselves around their father's neck." "The man had not known one happy hour since he left his children in the forest." "Now they live together in perfect happiness." Oh, yes. Tony Minnelli, I wonder who could it be. Corie, can you make us a pot of coffee? Thank you. The fuck? What happened? Lupo. Your car. Why was he in your car? Are you going to leave again, Dad? I got this one, okay? I got it. The gun's underneath the seat, Jimmy. Look after the kids. You greaseball fuckin' piece of shit. Whose fuckin' worthless now, huh? It's your big night, jizz bag, and you're spending it in my fuckin' trunk. Out for a nice country drive? Wow. You're awfully quiet tonight, Jimmy. What's the matter? I do something wrong? What, you don't love me no more? How long were you tailing me? Tailing you? No. What's yours is mine, What you know, I should know. We don't have secrets in this family. What you got here in this trunk is a problem. But all those terrible things that you said to me in the hospital, I... I know that's not you. And I want you to know that I forgive ya'. I want a lawyer. Jimmy, now you're hurting my feelings. Our fates are connected. So I'm going to skip the part where I tell you all the horrible things that are gonna happen if you lawyer up. But here's the good news. That garlic-scented piece of luggage that you got bleeding out in your trunk will disappear. All you gotta do is make the three dead bank guards from the Revere job reappear. All right, let's open this up. No smart-ass comments? No quotes? Hmm? Whoever we're looking for dismembered three men, shoved them in a can to rot with their skin peeling off. No more games, all right? These animals fall.
