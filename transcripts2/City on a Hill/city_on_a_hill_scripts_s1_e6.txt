 ♪♪ [doors close] [officer] These are the guns seized at Bromley Heath. Twelve-gauge pump. MP 40. One Colt 1911. Two Ruger 38's. One Glock 9 mil. And that's the AK. I gotta take this to the lab. [door opens]

 [Hank] The Bromley Heath arrests, they have priors. Two of them did gladiator training at Canterbury as juveniles. The other one was tried as an adult, but the conviction was overturned. Proving Lady Justice isn't truly blind. [Jackie] Decourcy Ward, you fucking hypocrite. [Decourcy] This coming from the guy who woulda underbid Judas to betray Jesus? You're dumping on your own. You're presupposing their guilt -because they're black. -The fuck you say to me? Ain't 'cause they're black. It's about the facts. Look at the rap sheet.

 I don't like to think about it like that, but at least I'm honest enough to say what's probably true. Indians used to kill retarded babies. [Hank] And we're off. [Jackie] Nope. I read this in a book. The little red kid came out bent, twisted with a fucked-up foot or a funny lip, they had no use for him. They didn't think twice. Into the river. Oh, shit, what'd I walk into? Nothing. Just a man looking in the mirror, not liking what he sees. That mirror looks both ways, Jackie. And I'm on the other side of it looking at you, judging your fucked-up brothers in Charlestown same way as I judge these boys in Roxbury. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's different. -How so? -'Cause... you believe in rehabilitation. Second chances. Time off for good behavior. I say black or white, throw the whole lousy bunch of them into the fucking river. Anyone want to hear the lab report? Please. Ballistics can't yet match the 7.62 mm round taken from the armored truck to the AK seized at Bromley Heath. -Shit. -You sure? Bullshit. Who fucking cares? [Hank] We need something before Decourcy can reconvene -the grand jury. -No, no, no, no. I'm calling bullshit. The grand jury doesn't know that we don't have a match on the fuckin' bullet, and they're a grand jury. They're prone to believing the worst. I swear on my dick we're going to get a match on that fragment. But in the meantime, we keep fucking pressing. This is why FBI stands for "Fucking Bunch of Idiots." County Sheriff's Department doesn't just date-rape their way into a case hoping for the best. And your conviction rates prove that. [Decourcy] Hey. I know this kid. Ziba Pippin. [Decourcy] United States Code 18.922. Mandatory sentencing for gun trafficking's 15 years. Fifteen. You add murder, you serve your whole time on earth. Oh, you tired, Mr. Pippin? Of this bullshit, yeah. [scoffs] There you are, serving me this fucked-up code of silence. The AK-47 found in your apartment was used to execute three white guards in an armored car robbery. Look at my sheet. See "armored car robbery" among my many achievements? Did you ever think about where those guns came from? That maybe those Charlestown cowboys wanted you to have it so they could blame you for the deaths of those three white guards, hmm? Prison ain't shit to me. ♪♪ [Decourcy sighs] You don't recognize me, do you? All assholes look alike. I know you from church. I know your mom. Delia Pippin. Works at Ronnie's Market. Nice woman. Doesn't earn much money, though. To make ends meet, she wholesales food out the back door. Stolen food. But who could blame her? Tough times, right? She'll only get a year, maybe two at the most... when I convict her. Now, last chance. Who sold the guns to Leonard Jensen? Some guy. Hmm? Speak up. Who? Some guy... from a bar in Revere. A guy named Hook? Yeah. [door opens] Wow. You almost had me believing you'd have put his ma away. [laughing] -Oh, jeez! -[kids laughing] Come here! Aah! Come here, you two little stinkers. Come here. What is going on in here? All right, all right, all right. -My little angel. -[girl] Grandma got me. Yeah, well, that's what wicked witches do. Come on, I just finished baking. There's cookies in the kitchen. Cookies! All right, be careful. They're hot. Don't burn your mouth. When was the last time those little shits got a bath? They stink. The hot water heater's still broken. -What do you want me to do? -Goddamn it, Cathy. Didn't I tell you to call Cyrus DeVany? Please, the last time I called him, he charges me $80, the boiler shits the bed before he's even back in his truck. Are you kidding me? -No, I got to call Pearson's. -Go ahead. Spend what little money you got left. You know, because what do I know? Yeah, exactly. What do you know? You know what you actually are? You're one of those fortune-telling machines down at the carnival. I don't feel so good. What is this, your bullshit way of trying to win this argument? Cathy, I don't feel right. Yeah, well, join the frigging club. C-Can't catch my breath. What? What do you need? I can't breathe. All right, all right, all right. Come here. All right, look at me. Hey. Dottie, look at me. Dottie! She hasn't been good to herself, Frankie. I keep telling her, but she won't listen. Doctors are saying she ain't eating right. Too many smokes. Too many gin and tonics. Her blood pressure's sky-high. It's diabetes. They're saying they may have to cut off your mom's feet. [sighs] Frankie... I got no insurance. I can't pay for none of this. I got it, Pops. I'll fix it. Lawyer. [sighs] Hey, lawyering up is your right. So, fuck it. Call your guy. Burn up your cash. But lawyers are not permitted to participate in a grand jury, which is where this thing is leading. You ever been indicted, Mr. Hook? Hmm? Lawyer. Hmm. ♪♪ Lawyer. [wheezing] [whispering] Ma. I thought these might cheer you up a little bit. I'm not in the mood to be cheered up. [Jimmy] How's my guardian angel? -Jimmy. -Hey, Ma. [laughs] Hey. [Jimmy] Hey. [groaning] I got this...this... [laughs] Look at that. How'd you know I was dying for a taste? How do I know? Because I pay attention, Ma. [Frankie] Guy rolls out of bed at noon, pinches a beer from my fridge, and you treat him like Bobby Orr on a breakaway? Yeah? What'd you bring? I brought the checkbook, as usual, Jimmy. That's fucking good. -Here. C'mon. -Nice. [sniffles] Is this Steve? [Steve, on phone] Yeah. Hey, Frankie. Ah, my mother took ill, so... uh, I'm stuck at the hospital right now for a little bit. Can you get someone to cover my-- my shift? Of course. Hey, you hear what happened at the Ebb Tide? No. A statie and a sheriff waltzed in, arrested Hook. ♪♪ Frankie, you there? Yeah, hey, Stevie, that's my mother calling. I got to go. Thanks. Fuck! What the fuck? They arrested Hook. Oh, fuck! What the fuck are we going to do? Huh? So, uh, at school, my first paper... I got an "A"-plus. [Jackie] Oh. Wow. Only "A" I ever got? Detention. [laughs] [Bennie] So, uh, why did you stop studying for your teaching degree in the first place? Because you came along. Great. Great, keep putting that shit on me. Bennie, come on, you were worth the change in plans, hon. What was this paper all about? From my comparative psychology class. Yeah, the, uh-- the conflicting theories between Jung and Freud. It took me forever. See, while Freud divided the psyche-- I raise my glass a lot, I know. But I raise it tonight to my amazing daughter and her A-plus. [Jenny] Oh, boy. [doorbell rings] Who the hell's that? Sit. Eat. I got it. [pounding on door] [doorbell, banging on door continue] What the fuck are you doing here? You didn't fucking call me. You can't come to my motherfucking-- Jackie. I'm pregnant. -Jackie, what's going on? -Nothing, no, no. She's-- she's just someone that came to me for help. -She's confused. -He wants to kill our baby. No, no, no. Shh, shh. Let's go. Come here. Come here. -Hon, c'mere, it's okay. -Hey, what are you doing? No, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. No, no, she's not coming in here. No, you can't-- She can't come-- You fucking scumbag son of a bitch. -What? -Ma knew. She tried to warn me. I didn't listen. How the fuck could you bring your shit to my doorstep?! -We were just having a nice-- -Get out now! I don't have any clothes! Yeah? Then go fucking naked! FBI man Jackie Rohr. No bags? Not staying long? Not up to me at present. The usual? Sure. No. Uh... no, you know, not tonight. No brunettes. [laughs] Do I know you? You look familiar. Where are you from? North Shore. I could have got that from the hoops. What part? Fuck do you care? Just thought I knew you. No, you don't. I don't talk to reporters. Well, you would be the only cop in the city -not willing to talk to me. -Well, maybe that's because I'm not interested in a kneeler out beyond the fens. One broad to another here? You got yourself a nice little job being an investigator on this grand jury. Now, I understand why the county and the state are involved, but what makes this a federal case? Why is the FBI all over some four-year-old missing person bullshit? No clue what you're talking about. No, you know what I'm talking about when I say Jackie Rohr? I am done with you. Look, I respect what you're doing. Keeping your mouth shut. It's your own version of the code of silence. But the Boston FBI is the most corrupt law enforcement body in the history of this country. And think, Jackie Rohr is their John Wayne? Wait a minute. Are you fucking him? Are you? Have you? [laughs] Oh, that's what this is, huh? Jackie would mow over his own feet if he thought there was something in the grass that he could trade for something better. Get ready, Sheriff Benham, you could be next. Aw, jeez. [laughs] Look at that. It's fuck-you o'clock already. [laughs] You know the president of the Senate said the same thing to me? [whispering] And I'm still here. That reporter bitch Michaela Freda, she says that Jackie's gonna derail us for his own good. Does she know something that we don't? Now I got to sell all my hoops. Why? Because I saw the same ones on her. Wait, wait. Where's the inventory from the raid? Uh... An M16, an M231. The National Guard armory in Macon, Georgia, reported a cache of weapons stolen this winter. M16s and M231s. Hopefully, they match the serial numbers of what we seized. There's no AK on the list. Time to go to the gun store. Huh? The ATF. [dials] ♪♪ Later. Hey, sweetheart? Sweetheart, I want to talk to you. About Dad, yeah. Yeah. Look, I-I know you love him. But what happened with that woman... I-I can't live with it. And I can't forgive. Look, I've been praying all night, and I... I end every prayer thinking about you, and... Yeah, you're pissed. I get you. No, it's... Do you really-- In psych class, we're learning about empathy. I don't want to hear about school or your "A"-fuckin'-plus. No, you know, and I-I-I get what you're doing right now, acting all sincere and shit, 'cause you want me to stay with you. But it's not gonna happen. I want to live with Dad. Fine! Fine, you go and you live with him! And his bullshit, his lies, the nights alone! I haven't done anything but be a good mother to you. And this is the payoff? Oh, you take his side? Well, I am fucking done with the both of ya! Go! Go ahead! [Jackie] Rosa. Hey. Over here. Wow. Looking good. Right this way. Got a table right over here. Here, have a seat. Smoke Darjeeling tea and a Fonseca Bin 27 ruby port...for you. Jackie. This room. The Dupont. I mean... -Too much. -Oh, no, no, no. Not for you. Not for what I want to talk to you about. A serious and polite conversation. Rosa, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot. From the day we met. Well, and I take all the blame here... I presented a grossly false image of myself, and then I poured on the charm and I threw money around like William Randolph Hearst. It was all bullshit. But my intentions were honest. Honest Jackie Rohr, hmm? I was nervous. I... I was afraid that you and Joe wouldn't give consent, and by-- by that I mean you wouldn't bless me and Jenny being together. You didn't have Joe or me fooled. I know that. And that's why I'm here to tell you that you were right. You were right all along. I'm not good enough for your daughter. Which you prove on a daily basis. What's your play here, Jackie? Rosa... with a gun to my head and St. Peter taking notes, I will never deny Jenny again. I want to make this right. I want to make my girl happy. I want to come home. And you could help me do that. I want my driver's license back. I'm a fed. State took away your license. What can I do? I want to drive again. Rosa, you hit a fucking school bus. And I want more port. Deputy Chung, you're acting like I'm asking for the keys to your house here. Look, we raided a tenement in Roxbury. We seized guns, guns which match weapons stolen from a federal armory, right? Now, all I want to do is find out if my case wing-mans any ongoing operations the ATF may possibly have that pertain to AK-47's. You know? And we can all, you know, share the wealth. Very noble and well spoken. Here's the ugly truth, Mr. Ward. There is nothing I will share with any agency in Suffolk County. Why? There are so many fucking leaks in Boston, you don't even get puddles when it rains. This is prophylactic protection of my agency. Thank you. Hey, you're... what are you, 40...ish? Yeah, why? Oh, you must have went through FLETC down in Glynco, huh? Yeah, so? Doug, you know Doug. Doug Fioritto. Head instructor at FLETC. Come on, you know Doug. He's a badass overman. Yeah, he's a legend. [Decourcy] Yeah, he's a buddy of mine. Good buddy of mine. Now, listen, you don't want me calling him saying one of his foremen is aiding and abetting inner-city gun violence, right? And you don't want him calling you, ripping you a new asshole. Right? Do you swear there will be no leaks? Yeah. How'd you know the lead FLETC instructor? I don't. I looked up his name before we came. Knowledge is power and commands obedience. Oh, Jesus, don't you start quoting. This is my chance. My chance at having a life. A teaching job, good friends. A life of my own, okay? Where my-- my fuckups are mine, they're not someone else's. They're not-- not his. Well, you don't have a job. And Jackie's a good provider. Did-- Did you talk to him? What, me? No, I hate the bastard. So, then why the pressure to take him back, huh? Because you're not using that brain of yours. All that Freud and shit, and you don't see. Your heart's beating up on your brain. You think he'd fight fair in a divorce? Jackie's got the bank accounts. How would you buy food or gas or pay for the lights? -You couldn't. -I don't care about the money. He'll take Bennie. You missed your chance to stand on your own like I told you, but that don't matter now. His guilt will get you whatever you want. A new car. A diamond fucking tiara. I don't know, Ma. I-I-I can't... This broke my broken heart. Yeah, well... be as dramatic as you want. But not a day goes by I don't regret letting your father walk out. Well, who'd he walk out on, Ma, huh? You? Or me? [knock on door] Mr. Ward. What, you, uh-- you don't call me Decourcy anymore, Andre? Do you have a minute? Sure. Anything for the cause. That's actually the reason I came. I'm sure you're aware of the rumors surrounding Reverend Fields and his behavior with some of the women in the congregation. They're not rumors. I know. The reason I came to speak with you is Siobhan. You spend a lot of time with my wife, don't you? Mr. Ward, I really don't know why you say that like that. Siobhan is my friend. -And I'm engaged. -Hmm. Okay. I'm listening. Siobhan confronted the reverend with the accusations. And I bet he didn't take that well. He did not. Worse, he's been -bad-mouthing Siobhan... -Hmm. ...to some of the other members of the coalition. He's saying she's a lawyer, so she lies. And she doesn't belong with us. Now, I'm a good Christian, and I admire Siobhan. Fields' words upset me. I tried to speak with him about it, and he scoffed at me. Like he does. Well, I, um... I appreciate you telling me this. If I were Siobhan's husband, I'd want to know. Thank you, Andre. You're welcome, Decourcy. [indistinct PA announcement Why are you so nervous? Hmm? Why am I so--? I-- Are you fucking kidding me? She's laying in there waiting for the saw. So why don't you go pour a little gin down her throat? [scoffs] Oh, fuck. Same old story, huh, Frank? You don't know how to enjoy yourself. You're barely even a fucking human being. You did everything the right way your entire life, -and look where it's got you. -It's got me about ready to punch you in your fucking head. [Jimmy] Fuck you, you piece of shit! You think I'm fucking scared right now? All right! -I'll fucking go right now. -All right! -Shut up, both of you. -[Jimmy] What? Hey! Back up. You're not going to say anything? What do you want me to say? Dottie's the referee between these two, not me. Ohh, fuck. What are you two not doing to fuck with Hook and these Charlestown assholes? Does your mouth hole ever get tired? It's a gift. How did your interview with Hook go? What'd he give us? Nothing. He's hiring counsel. Nothing on the AK-47? What'd I say? No. All right, let's-let's-let's think this through. Where does a 1960s Soviet-made Kalashnikov come from? Weapon of choice of the Vietcong and the Red Army. Roxbury gangsters? I mean... Hang on. Was Hook in 'Nam? Um...no, but his brother was. -What branch? -The Corps. Ah, fucking bingo! I look like Medusa with a head full of Pepto. Oh, come on. You're going to be gorgeous by the time I'm done. You know that hot young doctor, Davison? He's going to go insane. [chuckles] Why are you being so nice to me? You're sick. What else? [sighs] All right, maybe I got a question. So ask while I'm still breathing. [sighs] [indistinct P.A. announcement] How'd you put up with that shit... for all those years? How'd you learn to handle all this stress of not knowing whether your husband's going to be coming home for dinner, or trying to make bail? So, what, you want to have a real conversation? Oh, you know what? Go fuck yourself, honestly. Years ago, Frankie was just a baby. Jimmy wasn't even a drunken roll in the hay yet. Someone from the office... comes by. He's with a guy. He's bleeding. He's shot in the shoulder. Says to Richie, you know, "Can you hide him for a few days?" So Richie puts him in the basement. I say to Richie I'm gonna take Frankie to my mother's for a couple of days till he's gone. He says I can't. Everything's got to look normal. Anyway, a couple of days later, guy from the office comes by, gets the guy and drives off. Took me two hours to clean the bloodstain off the floor. Richie got an envelope. We didn't miss a house payment for a year. All right. So how'd you do it? Hmm? How'd you get through those couple of days not knowing who or what? How? I did it out of need. ♪♪ We needed diapers. We needed a roof. We needed food. You know, we all live our life the way we live it because we have to. You want to keep your family together? You ignore the stress. You hide the fear. You never let your husband see the worry, 'cause that can get him killed. The end of the day, you have no choice. Even Rose Kennedy couldn't escape it. Yeah. And four of her kids are dead. But she's still going, ain't she? [bell tolling] [grunts] Oh! Foul! That was a charge! Morgan, if you screw me out of a clean fadeaway jumper, you'll have to move out of the house. Hey, you pushed off. And it's two points. Check. Practice your threes. What are you teaching this kid? I'm teaching him beware of reporters coming up to you in public parks. Hey, use your legs. Keep your hands straight on the follow-through. You can do this. [Morgan] Yeah, yeah. [basketball bouncing] [Hank] Why the fuck are you haunting our investigation? What are you after? Jackie Rohr. Over the years, all of his informants either go missing or to the morgue. I want to know what he's hiding, and why. You're like a fucking cicada, you know that? Jackie's been doing his shit for 17 years, only now you come up out of the dirt? We're in the middle of a big and fragile case. Go back to your hole until we call you. [Morgan] Hey, Dad! Watch this! [Hank] Hey, that's a great shot [Morgan] I got a good coach. Meantime, stay away from Rachel Benham and me. Fucking Rohr. He's proving the adage. It's easier for two guys to keep a secret when one of 'em's a corpse. I'm not giving up, Hank. Not till Jackie's in Walpole getting his ass fucked. [basketball bouncing] All right, we're tied. Next bucket wins. [Fields] Evening, Decourcy. I hope you don't mind me dropping by. I have a meeting a few blocks away with... members of the opposing teams. [chuckles] By that, I mean Archbishop Law and Rabbi Blumberg. Your wife was supposed to be there, but she canceled. What's on your mind? Andre Benjamin came to see you. And... [sighs] ...well, there are a lot of rampant rumors floating around about improprieties with women on my part. Siobhan says that's true, that's good enough for me. I presumed you'd think me guilty instead of innocent, which is why I came to talk to you. These women are not telling the truth. They're out to get me. So everybody around you is lying? Including my wife? These allegations are erroneous. You didn't answer the question. Are you calling my wife a liar? You need to know that if you pick a fight with her, you're picking one with me. You take no responsibility for your actions, actions which can kill the coalition. I didn't warm up for a three-rounder this evening, but I'll rally. You have no idea the weight I bear leading this coalition. Oh, what a martyr. You see... you ain't from around here. So you have no sense of the history of violence and hatred that I am trying to erad-- Look, we're not going to play these games. I'm going to just be up-front with you. You keep talking shit about my wife, we're going to have a fuckin' problem. ♪ suspenseful music rises ♪ You want to try the other cheek? [sports announcer chattering on TV] [door opens and closes] Ralph Hook! Is that you? Who's asking? Jackie Rohr. I know your brother from the Ebb Tide. I don't drink there. He waters down the whiskey. [laughs] [Jackie] Oh, my first time in here. Mind if I join you? Yeah, if you're buyin', Sit your ass down. All right. So, what, you, uh... you never been here before? You a vet? Yeah. First battalion, third Marines. I was in Da Nang in '65. -You? -Yeah. 26 Marines, attached to the third in '66. -No shit? -Yeah. All right, well, I got to buy whatever sets you off. Yeah. A beer's fine. A shot of Jack and I go back there. I don't like it. Neither would you. Kahlua's my drink, for whatever reason. Kahlua? For real? Yeah. Yeah. Buddy, can I get a Kahlua? What do you say? A shot of Jack? Memory of the girl we left behind? Ah... Yeah, sure. What the hell. I got no pending appointments. And a shot of Jack. They're all finks, every one of them. They're rats! [man on TV] John Gotti supporters were left with a bitter taste after yesterday's guilty verdict. But John Gotti himself was left to grapple with his new reality: how to stay boss from behind bars. [man 2 on TV] I think John Gotti will be facing some challenges -to his authority as boss... -How old am I? What? How old am I? You mad about something? What the hell was that tonight with Reverend Fields? You threatened him? What do you think you were trying to do? The man stepped into my house. What was I supposed to do? I don't need my husband, or any man, to solve my problems for me. If I let that happen, I might as well stay home and iron your shirts. I handle my problems, my way. Siobhan, I was defending you. Wha-- I don't need you to do that. Ask me first. Oh, my God. Why are you just standing there? We got to put ice on that. Come on. Sit. Hey, babe... in high school, we played a team from Canarsie, right? So this one time, I hit a rope to center. I stretched it into a double-header. Hard slide into second. And then I stand up, safe, right? I'm safe. So this big, dumb second baseman, he gets hot and he kicks me in the balls. So I just stood there. Just let my guys pile up on him. Now, I never took my eyes off of that second baseman, never. And then he just... he...he just faded. That's very Sun Tzu. Baby, that was Fields today. He was that second baseman trying to understand why I wouldn't go down. So this is about you. Not me. No. No, no, Siobhan. All the work that we've done, all the work that you've done for the coalition, it's on the line. I know. Fields has to go, and you're the only one who can take him down. You're full of shit. Fuck you. I know a guy worked at the Garden in '88. We've all heard this wet dream before, you fucking asshole. This is the biggest bullshit myth in Boston sports. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gretzky, what, he-- he ties the game in the second period, right? And then some guy calls his brother and has him flip the breaker? Right, lights out in the Garden, Game 4, Stanley Cup Finals, really? -That's right. -This guy got a name? It was, uh, P-P-P-Patrick Farrell. "P-P-P-P--" Yeah. Yeah, Patrick Farrell. Look him up. The fog on the ice tripped the breaker, you stuttering fuck. A.C. was working overtime. It was June. It was fucking humidity up the motherfucker. There was no Patrick fucking Farrell protecting his money. You look that up, you shit stain. -Hey, fuck you. -Hey, fuck you! Fuck this! [all grunting] Fucker! Cocksucker! Aah! [grunting] [Jackie groans] [Jackie] Piece of cake. Hold on a second. Hold on. [drops keys] All right, there you go. There you go. Thank you. [coughs] So, show me. Oh, yeah. It's right over there, on the whatchamacallit. Oh, yeah. It's... it's from my M16. Where's the rifle? Sold it. It was a...rough year. [distant police sirens wail] Without me, my rifle's useless, and... without my rifle, I'm useless. Right? That's the... That's the Rifleman's Creed. [laughs] [bottles clatter] You all right? Yeah. Hey, you know, I brought back an AK-47. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. [whispers] I did too. No shit? Yeah, but it... it went out the door. [whistles] Before the M16. Hey, you know, I've been thinking about selling mine. Who handled yours? ♪♪ This kid. Real nice kid. I, uh... [exhales] ...boy, I-I forgot the name of the village. But, um, we passed through there, right? And they fed us. All of us. And then, later that night, the fucking NVA, they... had chopped off all their heads. That was such a nice kid. Semper-fuckin'-fi. Right? [sighs] You know, we, uh... We shouldn't have gone in there. [snorts] Well... We got them killed. [Jackie] I'm a piece of shit. To the bone. That's not a confession. I'm just, uh, stating a fact, just so you can take that into account. I was with your brother last night. Got him drunk. Got him talking about 'Nam and the Corps. Lied to him about me being there. I got three dead bank guards... executed with an AK-47 that your brother brought back from the jungle. The VA finds out about this, and they're going to cut him off. No medical. No pension. He's going to be more fucked than he already is. With tears in my eyes, I'm asking-- No, I'm begging you... please. Don't make me do this to him. Because I will do what's got to be done. 'Cause I'm a piece of shit. Fide nemini. Trust no one. For the record... fuck you. Call my lawyer. I'll talk. [inhales and exhales] [Hank] Is that remorse I see? Let's make that deal. -Mrs. Rohr. -Yes? You're the mother of Benedetta Rohr? What's this about? Yes, hi. I'm Simon Meredith. I'm a truancy officer with the Quincy School District. Um, Department of Attendance and Compliance. Your daughter hasn't been in school in three days. Is she home? Oh, sweet Jesus. [indistinct PA announcement] -[kids laughing] -[phone ringing] Hello?

Jimmy, please, no. Corie, they're talking about cutting her feet off, okay? She could die right there on the table, and all she wants is to see the girls, you know? Just-- Just one more time. Before, before, you know? That's horrible. I... But I think them seeing you messes them up. I won't do it. No, I-- Oh, Corie, I swear on Ma's life that I won't even be in the same zip code as you when you're in town, all right? Because you're a mom, and you understand that these... that these feelings that she's having. You promise you'll be gone? I-I-I swear on Ma's life. Jesus. Okay, send the tickets. All right. I'll pay you back when you get here, okay? -Jimmy! -Her feet, Corie. I'll work it out. [woman on P.A.] Dr. Marino to Pathology. Dr. Marino to Pathology. Hey, Trudy! Oh, thank God you're home. Yeah, Jen? Hey, a truancy officer came to my house. He said that Bennie hasn't been at school for three days. How's that puttin' light on my day? Well, Bennie and Gail are best friends. Were best friends. My Gail doesn't pull the kind of shit that your daughter does, Jenny. That's why I told Gail to stay away from Benedetta, especially since she started hanging out with that scummy guy. What scummy guy? I don't know. But that kid of yours, bad influence. And it's no wonder. You throwing Jackie out. Her drinking every day. I mean, look at you. All shocked and bewildered that she's gone missing. I mean, what'd you expect? I just-- I want to talk to Gail. Maybe you should have thrown your Ma out too. Clean up your whole house. Why the hell would you say that? I got shit to do.

With or without your blessing, I'm making the allegations against Revered Fields public. [all gasp and murmur] Siobhan, I know the position you're in. We just have to recognize that if these charges become headlines, our coalition will be adversely affected. Not just from a funding standpoint. I've deposed each victim, and these women are telling God's truth. Now, I've been going to church since I was a baby. And unless there's a bake sale, Sunday school or a toy drive, women are never included in the church's decisions. Isn't this a chance for a deeply sexist, male-dominated church to rise up, to speak up, and make positive change for all believers in Jesus Christ? [excited chatter] Reverend Fields will fight you on this. An eye for an eye. I've confronted him. He refuses to resign. If we can't convince him today to step aside, the court of public opinion will decide. [all murmur] He did this to himself. These are his sins, not ours. That's right. We don't have to pay for them. [door opens] [Jackie] So, you going to eat those eggs or just play hockey with them? What happened to you? Alcohol-induced haymaker. What about you? Hand of God. Literally. I was hungry when I ordered them, but the 20-minute lag just-- just killed my appetite. Mind if I do? Yeah. Yeah, go for it. So, when are you meeting with Hook's lawyer? Tomorrow. Make his balls sweat. Oh, I intend to. We are inches from blowing this case wide open. And then the fun begins. [chuckles] How's the Dupont? Well, you know, Jenny, she just... I'm tryin' to give her space. She just needs some time to, you know, make peace. With you? You and your wife ever go ten rounds? [scoffs] Ten. I never last to the tenth. I used to. -[laughs] -[cell phone rings] This is Rohr. She's gone. Bennie's gone. I-I can't find her, Jackie. All right, all right, all right, all right. Slow down. She's been out of school for three days. A truancy officer came to the house. Jackie, where's our daughter? When was the last time you saw her? Uh...yesterday, maybe? I don't know! Oh, shit. Ja... Jackie, you've got to find her, okay? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to find her. You stay by the phone, all right? [dials] Come fucking on. Yeah, hey. This is Rohr. I need a BOLO on a white female, brown hair, 16 years old, 110 pounds, 5'2". Name is... Benedetta Rohr. It's my daughter. All right. Jesus, Jackie, what can I do? You know, I'm hearing a lot about the top echelon informant program. How that's going awry. and there's nobody watching. -Not a good time, Michaela. -Am I rattling the cage--? Get fucking lost! That tells me that I'm rattling the right cage. [debris clattering] Gee, that ain't shit, huh? No. It's less than shit. Birds in the house, bro. [sighs] Bad Irish luck. Born white, and every fucking moolie thinks we get a pass on the miserable shit in life. The fuck do we do? What if Ma does need that operation? Fuck it. Let's get some guns and steal something.
