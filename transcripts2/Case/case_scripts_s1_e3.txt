 Far from this world of woe If there is a heaven Its gates will open for you -Hello? -Where are you? Yes, sorry darling, I forgot. I'm coming, sorry. -Bye. -Bye. Yes, that's good.

 You must be joking. I just found out Logi has been looking into this case. We should get him to work with us on it. Benedikt. Don't you agree? Agree? You will humiliate us. You will make fools out of us. -This was a mistake. -One question. Why have you been looking into this case? You told me to do what I had to do. This is it. The police closed the case. There are a lot of loose ends. Don't tell me you're considering it. Can I have a word? Logi is the only one who can help us. He hasn't been at his best lately. But you know he's the only one. Oh, I know how good he used to be. He really needs this. He doesn't seem able to take care of himself. -Is he still drinking? -Not that I know of. He's your responsibility. Aren't you supposed to be in school? I couldn't go. The funeral was terrible. -What are you doing? -This isn't working. -What do you mean? -Just this. You're 14 years old. I can't handle it. You aren't mature enough. Hi. Sorry I'm late. You know it wasn't the ballet. I... I don't know anything. Don't do this, Jónas. How do we know it wasn't too much for her? She was strong. Stronger than both of us. Maybe she was only strong because she had to be. I'm not ready to give up. Logi is ready to help. We know who you are. I know what you're going through. I will check everything he does, of course. We'll work together. Sorry, Logi, no offense, but... Why don't you just finish the case? Because... I think I'm too close to it. I'm going to talk to the police about alibis. Then I will interview people myself. -Did Lára own a laptop? -Yes. It has been returned to us. -I need it. -Okay. Are they close to finding the person who broke in? They must be investigating it. -Here you are. -Thank you. Are you sure about this? Do you have a better idea? -Do you want popcorn? -Yes. Can I get that one? I can't be bothered to use the microwave. Thanks. Sigurður retired. It had to happen sometime. I have a new doctor. -He's just arrived from Sweden. -Isn't that nice? Yeah. He's very fuckable. What? Can't I say this kind of thing to you? -He wants to speak to you. -Who? Sigfús. The new doctor. Why does he want to speak to me? I don't know. He's spoken with Mom and Dad. -Do you need milk? -Yes. Good morning. Hi. Listen... -Are you investigating Lára's case? -Yes, and others. -I have some information. -Okay... Come inside. Cool video. Your boobs are really nice. I saw the Child Services reports. I saw what Soffía and Pálmi did to Lára. Cigarette burns, bruises all over her body. I should have checked it out. -What if they find out... -They won't. I have to help them. Are you going to work with Brynhildur? It's not about her. Are you with me? Of course. That's her laptop. The police didn't find anything. Can you look at it? See if you can find anything? -Okay. -I'll pick you up later. No, I'll see you tonight. Then I talked to the manager of the theater, and he told me these accusations were nothing new. He admitted that Benedetto was strict, but the theater would never tolerate him giving them drugs. But this girl, Glóey, told you this. Yes. She seemed very scared. We have to investigate it further. You know we can't. We can't reopen the case. We have nothing new. Yes, we do. Her statement. She's just a 14-year-old girl. Nobody will believe her, she just lost her friend. Gabríela, Logi Traustason wants to speak to you. Just send him in. -Hello. -Hello. -Logi Traustason. -Yes, we know who you are. What do you want? Lára's parents hired me to represent them. Wait. Wasn't Brynhildur their lawyer? -Yes, they hired us both. -The case is closed. The investigation wasn't complete. This case was investigated like any other case. You didn't interview all the witnesses. You didn't confirm alibis. You don't know who she slept with. There was a call from the unregistered number just before she died. Didn't you find it suspicious? Wait a minute... How do you know this? It was in the case files we received. No, you're referring to our files. We took statements from everybody and we investigated the number you mentioned. Our investigation is closed, but nothing stops you from investigating further. What? If you find anything new, we will of course reopen the case. Let me walk you out. What a fuck-up. -When did you become a part of this? -Sorry, I didn't know. What are you doing here? I just wanted more information. I gave everything to Brynhildur. Just keep going. And one more thing... Look into the ballet. I'll contact you if I have something more. Well, then. Do you have the information about the doctor? No. This isn't going to happen. -We talked about this. -And now we have stopped. -Why? -Logi doesn't want to sell it. Stop this bullshit and give it to me. Or what? Will you have someone beat me up? I would never beat you up. This meeting is over. What's going on? What do you mean? He referred to our files. It's nothing. Someone must have let something slip. What? Don't tell me you gave it to them. Of course not. That would be stupid. Why did you encourage him to investigate? Maybe they'll find something. Do you think that's likely? This guy has been attacking the police for years. Come on. He accused one guy. Yes, a policeman. What kind of prejudice is this? You act like there can't be any scumbags in the police. That's not true. "What's wrong with you?" -Hello, Logi. -Hello. You know Brynhildur came over to me after you destroyed your firm. It took months to get her going again. You have her to thank for me speaking to you. The only reason I'm allowing you to continue with the case is because something stinks. We have specialized in cases of sexual abuse of minors for many years. Both Brynhildur and I want to nail those perverts. Don't fuck it up. You smell of alcohol. Do something about it. So you marked her present and that was the last time you saw her. Why are you asking me? -I told the police everything. -I know, stop this bullshit. Give me the video from the camera outside so I can go. What? -You are legally required to comply. -Wait. Don't you need a warrant? From a judge? You obviously watch too much Matlock. According to article 34 of law number 34 regarding the obligations of citizens, every Icelandic citizen must assist lawyers who are investigating cases. Failure to do so results in a fine or up to two years in prison. Do you want me to call the police? What do you want? Give me the video from the night she died. Now. Lára is nowhere to be seen. She never got off the bus. Was the kid lying to me? He was nervous. Did you make him nervous? He was hiding something. I had to drag every word out of him. -And what? We have nothing on him. -Not yet. -What do you mean? -He hasn't told me yet. -What are you going to do? -Pressure him. Either you tell me the truth or I will take you to the police. Come. I'm just going... Lára wasn't on the videotape. Okay, I faked the register. But it's not what you think. She came to me during the dance and said she was going to meet Egill, her ex-boyfriend. She promised to go home at the same time the buses arrived so no one would know. And why did you agree to that? Did she have something on you? -Doesn't matter. -It does matter. I told you who she met. Talk to him. Why didn't you tell the police? It doesn't matter. She killed herself. What a great guy. Hi. Have you found anything? Nothing the police didn't find already. -Look for some guy named Egill. -Okay. He's her ex-boyfriend. They must have communicated. -I'll check it out. -I have to go. Bye. -Tell me about this Egill. -Why? He might be involved in the case. I can't believe that. Egill is a very good boy. Why did they split up? We don't know. She just told us it was over. My feeling was that she broke it off. I don't think he has anything to do with this. I still need to talk to him. Where does he live? I forgot... I had to... I know things are difficult now, but this is not the right way to cope. -Really, I just forgot... -Give me the keys. Give them to me. I won't go to the police, but you can't be here in this condition. You know that. You're welcome back anytime, but not like this. Sorry about the mess. -You met Lára the night she died. -No. I hadn't heard from her for days. -That was not what I was told. -Told? Were you talking to Júlíus? Do you know he's dating Elfa Dögg? -Lára's friend? -Stop bullshitting. Everybody knows he works at the youth center just to get close to the girls at the school. -It's disgusting. -You can talk. Weren't you going out with a girl from that school? It wasn't the same thing. Just ask Elfa Dögg if you don't believe me. I will. You told police you were training at Valur. -Will they confirm it? -Yes. What are you going to do about this? Me? What am I supposed to do? Did something happen between you and Lára? -No. -She booked a meeting with the board. Do you know what she was going to talk about? I have no idea. Then the police called and asked about the ballet. Relax, I told them it was nonsense. I don't want any more attention. The police seemed to have inside information. What's going on? Nothing. Let's hope so. Hi. It's Hanna. Do you have anything? Can I get some? Yes. Exactly. Okay. You're so hot. Did you date that guy? He sent it to everyone at school. Could he have done something to Lára? I wouldn't be surprised. But I was with him the night she died. All night? Yes. But I fell asleep soon after the dance. -What about Egill? -What about him? No, he was too good to her. The ballet? Do you know anything about it? No. Well... She didn't really talk about it. I'm just going to go out. I have to help Rakel with something. Is it something serious? No, just a small errand. You know what she's like. Okay. Porn star of the year. Want to fuck me, too? Ugly boobs. Girls, you know how important it is for us to be united. Especially after that terrible accident. And now... It looks like someone talked to the police. Someone in this group. It wasn't us. Who could it be? Glóey was Lára's friend. I wish we could make her understand how important it is for the group to be united. Hi. I found deleted chats between Lára and Egill on her computer. Look at this. Stop bugging me. Meet me or I will do something. -Is that the chat? -Look at this. Answer, you fucking cunt. What's wrong with you? You're scaring me! Are you kidding me? -Hi. -Hi. Things don't add up. You lied to me. You said you hadn't talked to her lately. Her computer is full of recent messages from you. Threats because she dumped you. And you weren't at training. Did you think I wouldn't check it out? Okay, it's all a lie. And? Everything. The relationship, the sex, everything. What do you mean? We weren't together. -We were just good friends. -Stop bullshitting me. I'm gay. Why lie about that? My soccer career is over if anybody finds out. -And Lára covered for you? -Yes. It was her idea. Last year there were some rumors on the team that I was gay, and she suggested it. -But you broke up. -Yes. It happened a few days before her death. She told me it was over, no explanations. I panicked. I thought she was going to tell everybody because she was mad at me. That's why I really wanted to see her. I heard you had a tryout for a foreign team. -That's very important, isn't it? -Of course, but... She was my only friend. That night I was at a meeting at the Gay Alliance. -Can they confirm it? -Yes. Hi. Earlier today this picture of Lára appeared on the Internet. You should take a look. It's a site for distributing child porn. Can you see the owner of the site or the users? It's almost impossible. They're as anonymous as you can be. Find something. Anything. I can try, but it will take time. Okay. Is your brother home? You can't just walk in. Who are you? This is illegal. I know you took nude photos of Lára -and put them on that Gandreið site. -What? Where did you go after the dance? -Home with Júlli. -No. He went home with Elfa Dögg. That's a lie. Don't believe anything she says. -Why? -Because... Who are you? Please leave. Or what? You'll call the police? Do it. I'm sure they'll be interested in this stuff. Júlli, please come home. There's some guy here. He's asking all kinds of questions. I don't know. He just barged in. Yes, hurry. Júlli says you're not allowed to be here. Tell me about the pictures. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, okay, we filmed girls at the school. But never Lára. We never filmed her. It's not like we didn't want to... We do videos. Not photos. And we would never post on that site. -So you know it? -Everybody does. -But you don't use it. -No. Where do you put your videos? Show me. Then you have to leave. Okay. -Is that everything? -Probably. -What are you doing? -Taking the hard drive. You promised to go. Please don't take it. Don't. You are retarded.
