 Shouldn't we go downtown and talk there? Of course. We'll use this car. Listen. I'm going to talk to him downtown. I will take care of that without you. If you are going to stay here I need something in return. Don't you have a phone or something? Good. Isn't that Þór's place? They say the owner is fucking dead. What are you talking about? -What the fuck are you talking about? -It can't be true. -It can't be true. -They are confused. It can't fucking be!

 I told you I was worried about Þór after his arrest. -What was your relationship? -Relationship? You know, I was his lawyer. We know you did more than lawyer for him. Bullshit. You were investigating Lára's death. I didn't know about his connection to the case anymore than you did. Didn't you just find out that he was connected and did something about it? Wait, is this an interrogation? No, we are just chatting. Gabríela. There are a million videos on Þór's phone. But you should look at these two. I'm very sorry, but we have opened the investigation again and we want to finish it quickly. She was raped? You are quite sure? I'm sorry, but it looks like it. I'm sorry. Yes, hello. Where is Hanna? Do you know where Logi took her? No, why do you ask? -They have all been screwing her. -Who? -Þór, Logi and probably a million more. -Logi? What are you talking about? He would never do that. I'm sending you something. I will talk to you later. You are barking up the wrong tree. There is another man out there. Þór did his dirty work. What do you mean? Someone gave Þór information about the girls. Þór then used it to blackmail them, so that the other guy could rape them. How do you know? Sorry. Give me a minute. Tell me something. -Do you like little girls? -What? You took Hanna from the mental ward and took her home to your place. -What were you doing? -What's this got to do with anything? -Were both of you fucking her? -No. -Gabríela. -What happened? Was it jealousy? Was that the reason you killed Þór? -What the fuck are you talking about? -Yes, what's this about? This is Þór's phone. Let's take a look. It looks like this is the two of you. And here Þór is screwing her. I told you to shut up. Do you find this sexy? Don't listen to a word he says. Logi Traustason, you are hereby arrested as you are suspected of killing Þór Sæmundsson. You have to be able to sleep. -Don't you have some... -No. Just a little bit. -Just a little bit. -No. -I can pay you. -No. -I want some. -You can't afford it. I do. You know, we can... Come on. What do you think I am? How many times do I have to tell you? He was dead when I found him. I was supposed to meet him that night to get a video he took of this man. -Who is this guy? -I don't know. Where is the video? He said he kept it on a server. You have access to his computers, don't you? -You must be able to find it there. -Okay. Let's start again. Don't you believe me? I've stopped talking. -I need a lawyer. Brynhildur. -Okay. Hello, this is Gabríela. Logi Traustason has been arrested, suspected of murder. He wants you to represent him. Okay. I will tell him. She can't do it. -We have the warrant. -Thanks. Then I want Benedikt Hreiðarsson. Jónas. We have a warrant to take your computers. -Where is Hanna? -Who is that? That's a good question. -Did you kill Þór? -No. Of course not. You know how it works. You have to tell me everything. You visited Þór to get that video, didn't you? -Did you find it? -No. It wasn't there. It's hidden somewhere on the Internet. -Aren't the police looking for it? -They don't believe me. It would be better for us if the video was found. They are searching your home. -Will they find anything? -No. -Did you know Hanna was attacked? -No. -You slept with her. -Yes. I was drunk. I hardly remember it. Was it the first time you had sex with a minor? Yes, that I know of. -You are quite sure? -Yes. Because you have to tell me the truth. Otherwise... I'm telling you the truth. Can we stop talking about it? They don't have anything concrete on you. Just a vague suspicion. They could try to charge you for the seduction of Hanna. But as we know, those cases never get anywhere. It would be best if you could just shut up. I will take care of this. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. You know your boyfriend is suspected of murdering Þór. And we know he was fucking Hanna. Did you know that? Does he like to cheat on you with small girls? -How do you like that? -Is there something wrong with you? Þór raped Hanna yesterday. She is a mess. You have to tell me where she is. -I don't know. -Come on. I know you know. -She left. -So she was here. -She hasn't been back. -Thank you. Let's tell the media to help us look for Hanna. Jónas? You have reached to Jónas Waage... -Hello. -Hello. Have you heard from Jónas? No, not today. It looks like he didn't sleep here tonight. What? -Hello, Dabbi. -Hello, honey. Is Hanna Pálmadóttir here? Wait. -Should we look inside? -I don't think so. She is here. Hi, Hanna. Come with us. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. We wanted to ask you a few questions about Logi Traustason. When did you last see him? Who? Come on. I don't know who you are talking about. We know you stayed at his place. We also have a video of the two of you in a hotel room. We have a video from last night as well. -It shows Þór raping you. -It wasn't rape. Did Logi know Þór raped you? Why do you ask? Because Þór was found dead last night. What? Is Þór dead? Why were you at his place? Logi's cunt girlfriend told him to come get me. Did you tell Logi that Þór attacked you? No, he didn't know about it. Can I go? You are framing my client for a crime he didn't commit. He has decided to use his right not to talk. My client is innocent. We know you didn't find anything during the search and we know that you haven't anything linking him to the death of Þór apart from the fact -that he found the body. -You don't know that. Otherwise you would have used it. I demand his release right away. Why did you release him? We hope to get more by following him. Let him run around a bit. -You probably want a listening warrant. -Yes. Yes, all right. Logi. -You will be charged for seduction. -Do what you want. We talked to her. She told us your girlfriend called Þór -and told him to come get her. -What? You probably don't care anyway. I'm at Guðný's home. Jónas has disappeared. Brynhildur, he will come home. -Let me. -Logi wants to talk to you. Logi? Brynhildur... Hanna is a child. Everybody sees that. But... -How could you do that? -Yeah, but... Yeah, but? What's wrong with you? I never want to see you again. The autopsy report shows that Þór fell from his balcony and broke his neck. We don't know if he just fell or if he was pushed. No. As you know, we allowed Logi to go. We are going to follow him. I want all the boys from Þór's gang here. Have you found anything more on his phone? There was nothing more on the phone itself but it showed he was active on the darknet and I found connections to foreign servers. Logi says there is a video somewhere. Can you try to find it? We need to find everything we can. -We finished talking to the neighbors. -Okay. One of them said there was a car outside Þór's home for a very long time. Did he notice anything else? He wrote down the plate number. Who owns the car? It's registered to Jónas Waage. Yes? Thanks for that. Are you deaf? I'm going to kill you. I don't know what you are talking about. You know I saw you outside Þór's place yesterday. You know I saw you outside Þór's place yesterday. Is it the prescriptions? Is that the reason? Should I believe that? I'm going to fucking destroy you. You are no longer in prison. I have fucked everything up. Relax. Don't be too hard on yourself. I have to find Hanna. I think we should celebrate. Can I tell you a secret? I'm very happy that Þór is dead. This is my daughter Auður. When she was 13 she met the wrong people and started using drugs. We only found out too late. Then we had lost control of the situation. Soon men like Þór got her under their control. Got her addicted to hard drugs, abused her as they liked. Fucking scumbags. She was in the gutter. Sold herself on the cheap. Everybody had access to her. Old men took her, gave her drugs. My little princess. Did what they wanted. Nothing was too much. I didn't know. She allowed them to do her, many at the same time. Stuck her tongue wherever they wanted. And allowed them to put anything they wanted inside her. After a lot of rehab, using, more rehab, she wasn't able to live with her past anymore. She committed suicide. Fifteen years ago. Drink. We are going to use the fund to help those girls. Girls on the street. To honor your sister's memory. Okay. It's the least we can do. What do you think about it? Just fine. Do you want ketchup? Did she look like she was younger than 18? -I don't know. -I'm not judging you. Many have done it. I didn't know... I hardly remember it. -Could you do it again? -No. I have to ask you. -I'm... -All right. All right. I just had to ask. You don't want to be charged for seduction. I have to go. You know I'm always ready to help you. We can't find Jónas. And the gang can't be found. But there is something else. All their phones were turned off at the same time last night. Jónas' phone as well. Somewhere just above Árbær. -It can't be a coincidence. -Fuck. -Where can they be? -I don't know. Let's look at their Facebook pages. They are stupid. Stop it. I met Þór. -Why? -Because of my daughter. I was going to pay him for the pictures. Your daughter? What are you talking about? He was going to show them if I didn't write prescription... We weren't going to show any pictures. What the fuck are you talking about? You stole money. Logi told us. Okay then. Everything's all right. Help me understand. Why did Logi give us your accounts if this is something about pictures? What fucking pictures? Tell me. I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you. I have just started. I'll see you soon. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Brynhildur asked me to take care of you. I have heard bits and pieces, but I would like you to tell me. We discovered too late that she was using. We were told that we should send her to rehab. -So we did. -The worst mistake we ever did. There she met that fucking scumbag. An addict who is 20 years older than her. He introduced her to disgusting stuff. She is only 13. She finds it all very exciting. -And she ran way. -Yes. She is nowhere to be found. We want to send her up north to the women's only rehab. No worries. I will take care of this myself. Thank you. Here is a picture Gummi posted last night. What's there? Can you enlarge it? In the trees. Yes, there are some houses there. Isn't that Rauðavatn? Yes, it's up in Árbær. -I'm here. -I'm coming out. The police want to find Indiana París, a 13-year-old girl who disappeared from the rehab center at Vogur. Indiana was last seen wearing a purple sweater, a green T-shirt and jeans. She is 5'3" with long, blond hair. Those who have seen or have information about Indiana should call 444-1000. Hanna? Our sources tell us that the death of a man at his home last night is being investigating as a murder and the deceased is thought to be linked to the death of Lára Jónasardóttir. Her case has received attention because her parents accused her foster parents... Haven't you been paying attention? He is bullshitting you. Þór is suspected of killing his daughter. Do you think I'm stupid? Þór is suspected of killing your daughter and you met him just before he died. Do you think I'm stupid? Talk! I have had enough. Stop! I will talk! I went home to Þór! I was going to kill him! I was going to kill him! But I couldn't do it! I don't believe you. I fucking don't believe you. Logi is working with me on a big case. That's good to hear. Logi, can I offer you salad? -What are you doing here? -Come on. -No. -Quickly. Why should I go? The police are looking for you. You have to come. -No. -Yes, you have to. No, I'm going to stay. I like it here. If he gets you to use the syringe, he owns you. You want to come. I swear. Please, come with me. Are you going to tell us what is going on? We know you were at Þór's place last night. We also know you didn't kill him. The autopsy showed he died long after you left. There is obviously some link between you two. Jónas. If you know something, you need to tell us. I... I have nothing to say. What are you doing? Get inside. What are you doing? Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out, you bitch. If you come back here, I will kill you. Take your sweater off.
