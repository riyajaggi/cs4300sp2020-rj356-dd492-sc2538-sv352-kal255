 My dear Logi. Here's some coffee. Logi. How are you feeling? -Like shit. -Here you are. That I can believe. When my daughter died I was depressed, felt sorry for myself. But I conquered... -I'm not going to rehab. -No, no. Rehab isn't for men like us.

 You just need a chance to do some good. That's what I've been trying to do. There are a lot of girls out there who need saving. And... We can do it today. Drink your coffee. She is starting to remember all kinds of things. Sigfús says her system is working again and that she will remember even more. That's great news, Mom. But I don't have time. -I'll talk to you later. -Yeah, okay. Have you found something more about Þór? Yes, I found access to a secret server on his phone. Encrypted with a triple password.

 Usually there would be no way for us to access it. But? Luck seems to be on our side. He seems to have accessed it just before his death and it's open. The server is packed with child pornography, millions of pictures, millions of videos. It could be the largest child pornography ring found here. Can we see what Þór put on the server? We are looking for that video Logi talked about. Yeah, but it just takes time. I have to mirror the server before they find out that I'm on it and throw me out. How long will it take? I don't know. A few days. Okay. Can I talk to you? As you might know, I lost my daughter, and there are indications that she was the victim of the same men who victimized you. What do you want? Tell me your story. Again? There is a man in hospital because of you. -Has he charged us? -He doesn't have to. It was a very serious attack. I decide what happens next. And you as well, of course. You must be looking forward to meeting all your old friends in prison. -Don't you miss them? -What do you want? -Why did you kidnap Jónas? -He killed Þór. Why do you think that? I saw him outside Þór's house, and a short while later Þór was dead. What was he doing there? Þór was getting pills from him. He's a doctor, right? That's not correct. He didn't kill him. Þór was alive when Jónas left him. Þór had contact with Logi Traustason. What can you tell us about it? -He's his lawyer. -Nothing more? No. Wait, alive... How do you know? Do you want to go to prison again? -Tell me about Lára. -Lára? -Lára Jónasardóttir. -Who's that? Come on. You know who she is. Jónas' daughter. The girl who died. We know Þór had contact with her. That's got nothing to do with me. She was one of his hookers or something. The bullying started right away. I didn't have any friends. I started hanging with an older crowd. There it all started. First alcohol, then drugs. One thing led to another. This was before you met Þór. Yes. He was the first to inject me. He found me on Facebook. How did he know who you were? I don't know. But he knew a lot about me. At first he was very nice. Didn't you find it strange that he knew so much about you? Come on. He was older. Cute. And I didn't have any friends. I didn't think anything more about it. Those girls like to hang with guys like us. Then there are the drug whores. They just want stuff. You have to do better than that. I knew Lára was neither. Þór met girls on the Internet. He flirted with me on Facebook. I thought it was something. Then he asked me to send him pictures to prove my interest in him. Nude photos? I always said no. But he kept on asking. And you gave in? Yes, I... I sent him one picture. A picture of me naked above the waist. I was 13 years old. You could hardly have called them breasts. Then he fell silent for a long time. I didn't know anything. Then he contacted me again and sent me a list with everybody at my school and told me he would send them the picture if I didn't do what he told me. So I did. Did he meet them on Facebook? How would I know? He just brought us a lot of girls. -Lára? -I told you I never met her. What did you do with those girls? We played cards, took them in the ass, what do you think? -And did they want to be there? -Yes. Nobody forced them to be there. First Þór raped me a couple of times. Then his friends. I started escaping by using harder drugs. Every bone they threw me. Everything I could use to forget myself. Þór did what he wanted. It was disgusting. And the man? In the end Þór and his friends got bored with me. Then he started selling me. The man was my first client. Þór forced me to take a sedative. Ketamine or something. Then he drove me to the bus station. I think, I'm not sure. There he waited. The man. I lost consciousness. I woke up a few hours later at a bus stop. I can't remember what happened. I just felt it. Throughout my body. Especially down there. -Did you see his face? -It is all a blur. I found someone who worked a lot with Þór. Is that him? We can sit here all day and you can ask me questions, but I'm not going to tell you stuff I know nothing about. I think we are finished. Someone will come and take your statement. -What do you mean? -Kidnapping. Grievous bodily harm. I want to nail you for attempted murder. 16 years. You didn't give us anything. -Where are we going? -I'm going to show you something. In there is a known scumbag. Davíð Antonsson. He usually goes to rehab, picks on some young girls, breaks them down. Makes them addicted to hard drugs and abuses them. He sells them while people are looking for them. Then when he gets bored, goes back to rehab and does it again. What has that got to do with us? He took her away from rehab. She is just 13. Her whole life awaits. We are her only chance. What do you say? Indiana. No, no, no, stop. Easy. What are you doing? Don't do this. Where are you taking her? Easy, easy, easy. Jesus Christ. Logi, you drive. In the East? Yeah, I think so. But, there was... Well, how is the interrogation going? Not too well. We're off to meet Jónas to see if he will tell us something. He didn't tell us anything yesterday. Okay. What about Logi? Wiretaps haven't given us anything. He has been out and about since yesterday. We think he is with Benedikt Hreiðarsson. You want to continue with the wiretap? -Yes, that would be great. -Keep me in the loop. Yes, thank you. Come here. Easy. Easy, easy. You are safe. Here she is. Thank you. -Don't mention it. -Thank you very much. Where did you find her? You were right. She was with him. Of course. Take good care of her. Thank you. I see. And no one has heard about him? Nobody seems to have seen him. He is not used to disappearing like that, is he? -No, definitely not. -Okay, I understand. We will let you know. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Guðný hasn't heard from him for two days. She didn't know about the attack or anything. No one has seen him. What a bloody mess. You are the man responsible for my daughter's death. You're Þór's friend and a convicted murderer. You hacked my computer and stole information. -What are you talking about? -Don't stop at the lights! You're going to kill us both. Stop this shit. What the fuck are you doing? Why did you give Þór my accounts? I didn't give him any fucking accounts. -You were friends. -Ilmur must have done it. Shut up and drive. Drive! Believe me, I didn't have anything to do with it. Why did you stalk your daughter? You were spying on her. What the fuck was going on? -You don't know anything. -I don't know what? What the fuck are you talking about? Don't know anything. You are not him. -Is Indiana here? -Who? -The girl Logi picked up. -What are you talking about? No, don't go. Talk to me. Please. Let's talk. Did you see her? She's obviously not yet 18. -Everybody makes mistakes. -Mistakes? He's no better than the monsters we try to save the children from. He feels guilty. Can't you try to forgive him? -Not a chance. -Brynhildur, we just saved one of your clients from a drug den. -One of mine? -Indiana París. Her parents came here distraught, but you weren't in. I'm old. I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own. Just think about what we could do with him. You are starting to sound like him. How many times have you cursed the fact that legal options weren't enough? When you knew where the kids were using and where they were being abused. How many times have you been too late? Indiana. -Indiana! -Fuck you both. -What? -Great, just great. I work with these kids. I listen to them. Talk to them. That's their situation. I found out that there was a pattern. These girls told me the same story again and again. It was always the first client after the fucking scumbags had broken them down. Þór and his friends. Þór. He was just one of many. It started much earlier. They were given drugs, left in a public place to be picked up and then they couldn't remember anything. Just woke up with bite marks, bruises and scratches. Some vaguely remember the metal objects that were stuffed into them... The same story on repeat. It must be the same man who committed all these offenses. This man has raped and abused dozens, maybe hundreds of girls, for decades. Wouldn't you do something? Why didn't you tell the police? These girls won't charge anyone. These men know what they are doing. I started asking around. Then someone sent me the nude pictures of Lára. And a message. "Your daughter was not harmed during the shoot. Not this time." -But you still continued. -Yes. I... I just needed to be very careful. Keep watch on Lára. Make sure nothing happened to her. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Because I'm responsible for my daughter's death. Hello. We have never met. Benedikt Hreiðarsson. I work with Logi. Hello. Is Logi here? He doesn't answer his phone. No, he's not home. I'll tell him that you're looking for him. -Yes, please, thank you. -Sorry... Logi's not here, I'll tell him you were here. Thank you. -You are... -Hanna. Are you the daughter of Soffía and Pálmi? Yes. -Yes, of course. -Where is Indiana? How do you know about her? -I saw you picking her up with Logi. -I understand. We helped her. She's at her parents until she will be sent up north for rehab. She won't stay there for a day. Let's hope she does. I wish me and my wife would have taken our daughter's case in hand so early. What are you talking about? She was a wonder kid at school, computers, anything. Then she became isolated. Kids can be so cruel. Called her a freak. And other things I don't want to repeat. It's maybe something you know about? Today it's called bullying, but back then nobody understood. She said nothing, maybe thought we wouldn't understand. Then started taking drugs from her mother's cabinet. -I need to go to the toilet. -No problem. And when that wasn't enough, she started doing hard drugs. To soften the pain. But... It's finished. I've been thrown off the server. I looked at the things we could mirror, there's lots of child pornography, but nothing from Þór. Damn. What about the computers we took from Logi and Ilmur? I'm not playing in the same division as Ilmur. The data is protected by a code I can't break. Do you have any good news? Yes, I'm printing out all of the communications between Logi and Þór and tax returns regarding the business Logi and Ilmur had. How can we find a man like that? How... How can we find a sociopathic sadist? He sees himself as a victim. He is unable to put himself in other people's shoes. He has a very high IQ, but lacks all empathy. Þór told me he took a video of him. We have to find that video. Ilmur. -Could we get some privacy? -Of course. You didn't answer your phone. I think this thing with Brynhildur will be all right. I will talk to you tomorrow. What the hell did you do? Did you tell Þór Hanna was here? -Did you give him Jónas' accounts also? -She is here. -What do you mean? -Hanna is here. Where? He is the man. That Benedikt. I don't believe it. I don't fucking believe it. But it all fits. He's given Þór information from Brynhildur's child protection cases. Benedikt is behind it all. The rapes... Lára. -Everything. -Lára? Her dad was asking about the rapes of girls using drugs. Þór warned him. And I helped him. You didn't know what would happen. Brynhildur... Wait. Listen. Where are you? I have to talk to you now. Okay, bye. Find everything you can about him. Everything. -I'm going to meet her. -I'm coming with you. -Jón. -Yes. -Indiana's father? -Yes, this is him. -This is Logi. -Yes, hello. -I brought your daughter home. -Yes, I remember, thank you. -Is she at home? -Yes, she is in here. -Can you check for me? -Yes. Wait a minute. I'll check it out. -Yes, she is here. -Okay, great. Let me know if something changes. I'll let you know. Thank you for calling. Okay, bye. Their clients are quite the motley crew. It's just a joke company. Tanning salons, bars. And quite a few of our acquaintances. Þór and Logi communicate constantly. But it's nothing really. Here is a text where he is telling him about that guy who talked to the drugs squad. The guy who was beaten a few weeks ago. Yes. Listen... Maybe we could compare their phones' GPS coordinates to connect them. Yes. Let's try that. Look in your sweater pocket. Want more? No, they weren't together that night. What about the night Þór died? -That was... -Two nights ago. Yes, it looks like they met three times. In the middle of the day at Þór's place. That afternoon, they were here. And then that night at Þór's place. -We knew that. -Yes. Can you show me when that was? It looks like from 7:30 p.m. -When did we arrive? -Around about 8.30 p.m. What were they doing for an hour? What about the night Lára died? -When was that? -The 12th of May. I will go alone. Wait here. -Yes? -Hello. -Find anything? -Not yet. I just can't understand the story about his daughter. According to the National Register he only has one daughter and she's alive. What? Logi. Wait, you have to listen to me. It's Benedikt. Hanna recognized him. The bastard used your case files. -He has been doing it for years. -What do you mean? That daughter of his he's always talking about, she's alive. He is crazy. I don't recognize anything. Start telling the truth. This information connects you and Logi to many crimes. Us and Logi? I only see Þór's name. Don't add me to it. We know Þór took Lára to the theater and raped her there. Might Logi have been with him there? -Do you know? -Why don't you ask Logi? None of us did that with Þór. But Logi could be another thing altogether. He and Þór were close. How close? That's pretty far-fetched. Why do you think he selects those girls? Because he knows nobody believes them. He is more than 70 years old. He has been doing this for years. Even decades. He is raping your clients. Let's say I believe you, which I don't... What am I going to do? It's all about the child protection cases. He must keep something at the office. -Is she going to do it? -I don't know. -Hello. -This is Jón. -Indiana ran away. -When? It just happened. -Have you called the police? -I just did and then I called you. Good. I'll check it out. Indiana is gone. He has gotten her again. No, she always would have done this. -This is Benedikt. I'm not here. -Fuck. Yes? There is a man at reception who wants to talk to you. Okay. -That's enough, then. -Yes. Couldn't you do your homework better? You must arrest Benedikt. He has found a new victim. What's going on? You are arrested for Þór's murder. Give me the handcuffs. -Are you nuts? -Can you help me, boys? You have the right to remain silent. -Do you know your rights? -Are you crazy? Where were you the night Lára died? I know where you were. Take him to a cell. I'll talk to him later. Can I help you, my dear? No, I'm just looking for information. What information? Logi said... Logi thinks you are involved in the case. Lára's case. And others. That you used my case files to... I understand. I've opened all locked areas. You can search what you like. I'm sorry, I... Things have been happening so fast. I don't know what I'm doing. How can I trust you after this? I will give you my letter of resignation tomorrow. I'm sorry. Not as sorry as I am. Lock the doors when you leave. -Can I talk to a lawyer? -Yes, no problem. 6948410. Brynhildur.
