 "Create a fund in memory of their daughter." "Lísa says the healer's name is Fróði Sigfinnson." Memorial fund? They are crazy. Of course we will do something about it. I just have to... Yes, it's serious. It's ridiculous. I agree, my dear. Yes, we agree. I have to finish work. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Weren't we going to meet an hour ago? Where are you? Jónas and Guðný found a nude picture of Lára's sister on the web. -Hanna Pálmadóttir? -That's right.

 Why didn't you tell me sooner? They are my friends. I thought you were checking out the ballet. You have to check out the ballet. Yeah, okay, what do you want me to do? Can you talk to Lára's friend, Glóey? -She knows something. -What are you going to do? I'm going to find Hanna. It's very likely they were both photographed by the same man. Hi. Hi. You aren't supposed to be here now. I know. I couldn't be bothered to go straight to work. Work's been crazy.

 Work has been crazy, and I smell a rat. I just smell it. But nobody gets it even though I try to explain. It's making me crazy. Just move in here. Rakel. -Hi. Am I interrupting? -No. Great. It's great that you are here. I've got a list of questions... It has to wait, I'm too late for work. Can I have a word? -I won't be a moment. -Okay. What's going on? You know I'm trying to help her. Can't we work together? Do you think you are the first doctor who is fascinated by her condition? She has had numerous doctors, therapies and so many drugs it's nauseating. And they were all going to fix her. My parents really want her to be healthy so they believe everything you doctors say. Of course I want her to get better. But I don't believe you can help her. I'm sorry. She doesn't want to talk about it. It's very important, just a few questions about the ballet. She is in shock. Can you talk to her? Lára's parents just want to know what happened. We want all the help we can get. I'll contact you if something changes. Good luck. Ilmur? What the fuck is going on? Call me. Any news? What's going on? The chief is looking over our shoulders. It's just nervousness. Are you going to show me what you found? Of course. I'll finish this and then get it to you. -Yes. -How are you doing? -I'm still looking for Hanna. -I went to Glóey. I talked to her mother. She doesn't want to talk. Then you have to find a way to talk to her. -How? -I don't know. Think outside the box. -Logi... -I will see you. Logi. -Do you know Hanna Pálmadóttir? -No. Dark hair, rather small. I don't think so... Hi there. Do you know Hanna? -Hanna Pálmadóttir? -No. -Dark hair, not tall. -No. Hi. Do you know Hanna Pálmadóttir? -Why? -I'm looking for her. Why? Are you her dad? No, I just have to find her. Do you know anything? Maybe. I mean... If... Can you pay us? I can give you 5000 kr. Can we get it now? Stop the bullshit. Where is she? Didn't you say she was at the mental ward? -Yeah, last night, the police took her. -Are you sure? That's what I heard. -Listen. -Yes? I've been going through the pictures. I noticed one thing. Do you recognize this? Do you recognize this? -It can't be a coincidence. -No. What is it? It's Lára's sister. Oh? -It's the same spot. -Do you know where? We have to talk to her. This could change a few things. Shouldn't I tell the chief about it? Great. Well done. Who are you? What's going on? My name is Brynhildur. I came to your house earlier to talk to you. You just have to help me. It's very important. You don't know what they will do to me if I tell you. I promise that nothing will happen to you. You can't do a thing. I talked to the police. -They didn't do anything. -I know. But you have to tell me everything you know. They will kill me. I know they will. You talked to the police. You want to talk about it. Benedetto is obsessed with success. He's ready to do anything. Give us pills... Anything. Anti-depressants, steroids, diet pills. Speed, if they don't work. Just name it. If it makes us better, he will use it. How could he do that? Why didn't anyone talk about it? Don't you get it? We are all doing it. Lára as well? At first she got steroids to make her stronger. Then diet powder... What? Benedetto always thought she was too fat. It was complete bullshit, but he made her take diet powder. Three weeks ago she found out that it was mixed with amphetamine. -And what? -She was going to tell. But Benedetto probably found out. He singled her out at rehearsal -the day she died. -In what way? Benedetto has a system. He singles someone out and makes a speech about nobody being bigger than the team. That's how he signals to Unnur and the others that they should bully her. And did he do that to Lára? And what does that mean? He takes you down to the cellar. And? He locks us in a room and makes us stay there until the rehearsal is over. Can you prove any of this? What about the drugs? Are any of them at Lára's home? No, he just gives us one dose at a time at the theater. Do you know where he keeps them? At first I thought they were in his office. I broke in. But the girls told me they were in the cellar. Where exactly? I don't know. I have nothing more to tell you. Don't talk to me again. Come in. Sorry. Jónas and Guðný are here. Brynhildur is out. Show them in. I'm sorry for your loss. Take a seat. What can we do for you? They have to be stopped. Anyone can open up an account and raise money for a good cause. This is about our daughter. I can't believe just anyone can open up an account in her name. What can we do? We can ask a judge to stop them, but I must warn you... It will be very difficult to get a judge to do it. And if he allows it you have to put up a guarantee. What do you mean? You have to sue them within a week and put up money to pay for the damage done if the court rejects the suit. It's completely nuts. Are you saying that we have to put up money to pay for possible damage to the people opening up an account in our daughter's name? -What do you think? -What's the amount? A few million. We have to stop it, whatever it costs. The whole ballet company? That's a very serious accusation. I'm told all the girls knew. You must have heard something. No. Then I would have done something. This is ridiculous. Then let's go downstairs and look at the basement. It's just old boiler rooms. We are talking about hundreds of square meters of old storage rooms. We can call the police as well and get them to bring a dog. So that everyone will know? No. There is something going on. The ballet is our pride and joy. No way. Goodbye. How did you know about Logi and the girl? I just saw them together. I admit that it was maybe too much to follow them to the hotel, but I thought you had the right to know. I always knew he was a scumbag. Thanks. -I'll see you, good luck. -Thanks, Þór. -Good morning. -Good morning. Hanna Pálmadóttir. She's here, right? -Yes, she is. -I'm her parents' lawyer. I've got power of attorney. Just a moment. I've told the Sex Crimes division. Hanna is at the youth mental ward. Really? She has had problems for years. I'm going to talk to her. I need to talk to her. -Can you finish this for me? -Okay. I won't be long. Give the psychiatrist a visit. Tell him we know all about the money he took. Then you ask for prescriptions. For anything special? Are we just going to check him out? Ask for three, four doses. If he says yes we got him. No problem. But don't mention me. A lot of the girls at our parties are his patients. They are? See you. Glóey, can you talk to me? I asked you not to speak to me again. It will just take a minute. -I don't want to. -Come here. -You have to get the drugs. -No way. Glóey... I can't. I don't dare. Don't you want people to know what is going on? I do, but... -But? -I don't dare do it. Then there's nothing I can do. Then it will just continue. There is someone here to talk to you, Hanna. There you go. What are you doing here? I have to ask you about these pictures. Who took them? Why do you have them? It's important. It's to do with Lára. Typical. Everything has to be about that fucking ballet bitch. It could have something to do with her death. I don't care. It's not my problem. I won't leave until you tell me who took them. I can tell you if you can get me out of here. Okay. Okay? I've got a power of attorney from your parents. What? I said I was their lawyer. I falsified some papers. Glóey, on your mark. Again. Back to your marks. And... Start. What's going on now? When I tell you to hit your mark you will do it. Get it? Get... Get on your mark! Now. Or what? What will you do? Get out. Out! Now! Fucking move! You were warned. Now you are fucking it up. In here. Hi. Thanks. Hello? -Good morning. -Morning. My name is Gabríela, I'm from the police. I want to talk to a patient, Hanna Pálmadóttir. She just left, you just missed her. When and with whom? Logi Traustason had a power of attorney. And you just let her go? -Yes, he had permission. -What was wrong with her? Just... She is a heavy user. Came in last night after she lost control at some party. Thanks. I'll take this. -Wait, you can't just... -I will return it. Okay, who took the photos? It's not complex, it's one fucking name. -Okay, if you can get me some. -Get you some what? Uno or Conta. Okay, but first you have to tell me his name. You have to get the pills first. That's not what we agreed. Good morning. My name is Gabríela. I'm a police detective. -I'm looking for Hanna. -She's not here. Hanna. You know she was at a mental ward last night. What? No. I've got a power of attorney signed by you in the name of Logi Traustason. He came and took her earlier. We haven't signed anything. -We haven't seen Logi for days. -What happened to Hanna? -So you didn't know about it? -No. Jónas Waage? What are you doing here? Let's talk inside. Haven't you done enough? We? We know quite a lot about you. Let's go into your office and... Get the fuck out. I'm offering you a very fair deal. I get an appointment and we will talk about it. Sleep on it. Sit down there. What the fuck's going on? Why don't you answer your phone? -Have you gone crazy? -What? Get the fuck out. What are you doing? I know you fucked her. Why is she here? What? How do you know that? It was a mistake. I was drinking. It was completely random. I can't remember it. I'm sorry. It was a mistake. -It was shit of me. -Why did you bring her here? -You have to help us. -Help you? She's Lára's sister. Where have you been? Out. Didn't you have a phone? Shouldn't we talk? I'm going to get the stuff. Isn't that all right? This is bullshit. Then she has to go. -How did it go with Glóey? -I don't know. -Maybe I went too far. -Did it work? I don't know. -I found Hanna. -What did she say? She doesn't want to talk unless I get her some dope. What? You're not going to do it, are you? She is a minor. Not that it matters. You're not going to get her drugs. -It's the only way. -That's enough. Let's stop here. Don't do it. Okay. Have you got it? Cool. Yes? It's her. Hello. I see. Okay. She won't say what happened, but she asked for you. What's going on? Did something happen? I'm finished with the ballet. Finished? What happened? I did it. I found the drugs. Where are they? This is nuts. You can't do it. -I have to. -No. -You can't do it. -It's the only way. Here you are. Who took the pictures? Hanna. Who took the pictures? Hanna. It's just between us. He's going to fucking kill me. Who? Þór. Þór took the photos. -Why? -Why! -Why did he do it? -Are you fucking joking? Hanna. Why does he do it? -It doesn't matter. -It matters. If he photographed you, he also photographed Lára. I know. -What do you know? -Nothing. Is there anything else you're not telling me? I was with her that night, that's just... -The night she died? -No. The night he took those fucking photos. And what happened? He made me put some stuff in her glass. He was going to take the fucking photos. That's all I know. That's all I know. He promised to leave me alone if I did it.
