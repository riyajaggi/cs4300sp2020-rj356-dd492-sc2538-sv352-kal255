 Entrance to the maze should be somewhere in the canyon. I think it's not so simple. N-well ... probably ... What? Are you feeling bad? N-well, I would like to go look for flowers. There are no flowers. Bly-in! Well, anyway, we're on our way to the Great Volcano Gruen, so that we can pass it if we find it. Hajime-san, Yue-san! There is something unusual here! Come here! Here! Right here! Greetings! Come in!

 Welcome to Super Duper Amazing The Great Labyrinth of Milady Rysen! Oh, where does the voice come from? What's the difference? We finally found the entrance to the maze! fifteen Do you think this is true, Yue? Are you sure? Similar was in Oscar's recordings. So, and where is the entrance here? Hey don't touch ... Come on... And where is she? Wet hare. Do not look, please ... Are you scared? After all, were you afraid? Surely scared! Looks like it's time to use the thing, which Hajime-san has done for me!

 Oh, what a disaster! This plate by itself will recover after some time. I bet that milady Riesen is by no means image does not apply to liberators. She is simply the enemy of all mankind. I totally agree. I can’t understand in any way, it seems this place in the maze or not. Scarlet Spear! Looks like we can't here. use shells from magic. That is still a nuisance. Wh ... - Leave it to me! Hajime-san, Yue-san, hurry up! X-good. Gone! How are you? That helped you cool your heads? Is this floor really very sticky? Hey Hey! How are you feeling? My lady How many more will you publish? Does this room remind you of anything? Definitely. There is this. First room? Seem to be. Hey, how are you feeling? So how? Nia-san when Ai-chan-sensei planning to go? It seems she said she was going somewhere in a few days. Not much time left. But maybe this is for the better. If you pull for a long time - the spleen can not be avoided. Hey, Yuuka-chchi, why are you all of a sudden? Nothing, I just can’t sit here and do nothing. So I'm going to go with Ai-chan. Hey, really, why are you all of a sudden? Calm down and think it over. I am completely calm. My decision is not spontaneous. I have long believed that you can’t continue like this. Nagumo died and I was scared and confused ... But I feel that at least something should do. You feel it too? Are you serious? You can die! This guy is definitely dead! Without abilities, he committed stupid thing! And now dead! But this one is not capable of anything the fool saved my life. No, he saved our lives. N-well and ... I do not urge you to come with me. But I don’t want to waste time either. Listen, Yuuka, will you really go? I have no courage to go with Amanogawa-kun and others but I will try to at least protect Ai-chan. Well, here it is. You think have we reached Milady's lair already? Well then, we should celebrate. I alone feel unpleasant Feelings looking at armored racks? Everything is good. Everything is within our expectations. So ... will they attack us? Hey, Hare Boss. Wh-what? You are strong. We acknowledge this. So go ahead and get bold pleasure. We will help. I will look after my student. Yue-san, Hajime-san ... I’ll break this Milady Rysen! Carelessness will kill you. Three punishments. Yue-san, I apologize! There you are! They have no end. Hey, jump! Hello to you! Nice to meet you! Hey, really? Very big... Uh, this is definitely the ringleader ... You are the universal favorite Milady Rysen-chan! Who are you? Milady Rysen is a man and had to die a long time ago. I read about it in Oscar entries. Oh can it be that you are alone of those who went through O-chan's maze? Here I ask questions. If you don’t want to answer, then start the battle. We are here only for ancient magic and all. I'm telling the truth! I am the real Milady Rysen! If you want to know more, then you better answer my questions. What is your goal? Why do you want ancient magic? My goal is to return to my homeland. After all, this is yours crazy god made me be here. Clear. This is really a disaster. We are looking for ancient magic able to move between worlds. I'm not going to spend your life for the good of this world. So answer. In this maze is there magic capable of this? Well ... I will not say! Die! Destroy its core! This is the same as the heart! Oh, and you are not so bad! It's true? When managed? Get it! It worked? It seems strong, but ... I want it to be over! Well, you just tickled me. If your artifacts can show your true power ... Azantium? Damn you! If you are in a hurry, you will regret it! Dodge! From above! Get it! Now show me, can you survive? Heck! You both hold on! Yes, desu! As I thought, this is impossible. But if they can't handle it, then they won’t defeat those freaks. I already told you that those "Freaks" do not interest me! K-how? I can tell you, but ... Sure I have to look only at me? Break! No matter how many times you will be repeated! Both my hands can recover and repair. I won’t be idle all the time. Again? It will not be able to break through my armor! I know! Freeze. Crystal Coffin. Good! Get it all and die! It seems that the strength is not enough! Then your magic will not be so strong. Shia! Kill her! It worked well. Shea, bend over. Hajime will not praise so I will do it for him. I tried well. Yue-san, I ... I ... I was so scared! Thought we couldn’t! Wait! You two finally called me by name! You know, I don't wanna destroy such a moment, but ... I definitely destroyed the core! I use the remnants of my strength just to talk to you. I don't want to hear anything about those freaks. This is not so much a conversation how much warning. As you said, you came here behind the ancient magic of the Liberators, necessary for your purposes. It's like that. Good luck. Something very nice of you. Sorry, those damn freaks really bad guys ... So I just wanted so you get used to it a bit. Hey why do you say so like we're going to fight them? Because you will. While you... you remain yourself. You will become a killer of the gods. I do not catch the point. If they of course stand in my way, I will, but ... That’s enough. Live as you like. Your decisions are required will be for the best for this world ... Thanks for the work. I tried well. Thanks. I hope you guys are able to live your lives the way you want them to. Greetings to you, long time no see! It's me, Milady-chan! It was a wonderful speech, wasn't it? Well, Milady-chan is so talented! Such an actress disappears! What? P-wait, this body is very weak! If you break, I will truly die! Calm down! I'm sorry, okay? So this is the ability to control gravity. Use it for good. Oh, but you and the bunny-chan don't have to her predisposition. You will not reach heights in it. Shut up you. This is just a guess! But the blonde is perfect. If you practice you can use it. There must be others evidence that we have passed. You must have useful artifacts or rare materials. Come on here! T-your behavior and actions more suitable for old thieves, you know ?! Just think that the pioneers will be so impressive ... Well, okay! Guys i'm you send to the surface! Good luck! Go through the rest of the mazes! Where are you staring? I’ll surely break it someday. Yue, Shia, are you alive? In order. Shia? Hey Shea ?! Hey, wake up! Hey! You... Utilis, you perverse rabbit! I didn’t think she was with her language immediately climb ... Welcome! D-Welcome to the Masaka Hotel. Need a room. And the food. And also, please, a bath. A room for three. D-d-for three? It is impossible. Take two rooms. For me and Hajime and for Shia. What?! I do not want, so that you separate from me! One for three is enough! You will distract me. Divert?! What are you going to do? What does “what” mean? Then, Yue-san, Get your own room! And with Hajime-san I will be in the same room!
