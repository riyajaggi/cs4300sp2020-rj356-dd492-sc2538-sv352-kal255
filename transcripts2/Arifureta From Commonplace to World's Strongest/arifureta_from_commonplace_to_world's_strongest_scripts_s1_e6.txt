 It doesn't hurt to reject you the request of such a beauty? Do not call yourself a beauty. Shameless. Did it just growl at me? You can not! This is a monstrous crime! Please run! You dealt with this Dichedoa ... Wow! Come on ... quickly unhook! My name is Shia the eldest daughter of the beastly tribe of Howley! Please save my family! I beg you! You are welcome! What's wrong with you? Pestering. Cause if I don’t try then the future of the family ... Okay. Painfully! Damn, I'll listen to you. Balfoe fpafibo! Do not dare to wipe your face on my cloak! T-you hit again! I can't Believe that you hit a beauty! I can’t believe it, what are you saying? all this nonsense with a calm face! Especially when you are standing opposite Yue, which is an order of magnitude higher! N-but! I! I have some places who also do not lose to her! I win! Look at her, she’s absolutely flat! What do you think? Ha? Well? Blushed? Well, blushed a lot? Ah ... And if I stop, will you forgive me Prayed? Not! I do not want to die! So you were expelled from your at home and then attacked by monsters? Beastmen can't directly manage mana, but somehow I can. And besides, I can use a special magic that only monsters own. Special magic? Yes, she’s called the Foresight of the Future, and I can see possible variations of the future. Perhaps if you choose something, then it can happen. That's why I knew that you two would appear! Please help us! If you leave everything as it is, Howley will be destroyed! I refuse. Please stop! I looked into the future! I saw that you are helping us! And what will I get? Well? Nothing, right? You are heading to the Great Tree in the Haltian Trees Ocean? It is always surrounded by dense fog. It dulls the senses and makes everyone lost! So what? So you need a native The seas, and I can spend ... Take her. Yue? Leading. Just. Thanks a lot! Glorious thing! Look, look! Kinomi found! No, come back! Trouble! Daddy! I brought help! Shia! Daddy guys! If you feel full of energy then you better work. Work? Well what are you. I just beg you upstairs to be the bait ... a simple job. Go ahead and with the song, useless rabbit! Not! I can’t stand it! You are too rude to me! May I ask for a more gentle treatment? Because I am able to use abilities just like monsters, my fate was supposed to be plain, and I myself, in ultimately, it could have been killed by other beastmen. But my father and the rest of the Howley tribe decided to leave our homeland, Verbergen ... for my protection. But we humans not able to fight and protect themselves. I thought I'd never see again how can everyone so relax ... Thanks a lot. Not worth it. I promised that I would protect you all before arriving at your destination. You know, this is the first time I meet someone who is the same like I am able to use the powers of monsters. So it's hard for me to think about you as strangers. What is the purpose of your trip? The goal is one. Return home with Yue. That's all. I decided! I will go with you! Not necessary. You will interfere. With no doubt! We want to become stronger! We do not want to be weak! I beg you, Hajime-dono. Well you... Opened! Hey. Yes? Don't tell me you jumped and they rode because there were flowers around. Do not doubt! We love all the beautiful flowers and all the little bugs, and that's it! Ts-flower! Hajime dono ?! I was stupid ... Listen here, useless rabbits! If you do not want to die, then they quickly started killing monsters! Kill or die! Scarlet Spear. Not all! Fiery Fortress! I will get you! Wall of the Wind! Crystal Coffin! Hey th ... I won. Yah... What? Yue-san, cheek! There is a scratch! Scratch! I got! There is no scratch. But she was ... Do not play the fool, this is terrible! It was really cold. For a second i I thought that I could not stay alive ... Finished with a duel? Yes, I was finally able to hurt Yue-san! Big win! Ah, I would like so that Hajime-san sees this. Ho. Well, Yue, how is she? Honestly, she specializes in strengthening your own body at the level of a monster. Already not bad. Hajime-san, please take me on a trip! Why do you want so with us? N-well, this is ... This, what is this? Because I want to be next to Hajime-san! I love you! What? Boss, we figured out these monsters. O-father? Your speech ... It even feels different ... I told you that one is enough. We were persecuted by many, and some even had the courage to try to kill us ... so we sorted them out. They were so annoying but their screams were so sweet ... Hajime-san, what did you teach my family? Fight. This is the Great Tree ... It was dead long to the base of Verbergen. But it never rots. Stood here for ages, dead and unchanging. Like the same in Oscra ... Yes, it looks the same. This seems to be the entrance to the great maze. What is it? Only for those with four characters, by the power of restoration and a beacon of bonds This door will open. What does it mean? Four characters most likely relics from four other labyrinths. And the "beacon of bonds" must mean one of the beastmen helping you! And the power of recovery ... It doesn't seem like that. Maybe as soon as we clean the other four labyrinths we will get the ancient magic of restoration. Here is how. What a trouble. I think we should go to these labyrinths. You heard? I'm going into other great labyrinths. Thus, the terms of our transaction fulfilled. It's time to leave. Now you are quite capable survive on your own. Boss! Please take us with you! We ask you! Denied. We will follow you! You must not, you must continue your workouts. You may be useful to me in next time i come here. Did everyone hear everything? We can come in handy to the boss so start training immediately! Mom, am I a monster? Am I a beast? White shadow hiding in the sea trees always dodging and disappearing before you understand it. This is a new type of monster. or the beast that inhabited forest since time immemorial? Are these the stories you heard? These big rabbit ears who hear so well? Shia, you don’t want to be a monster? Of course I don’t want to! Why? Why? Not very nice to be different. It is scary, lonely and sad. But you know what, Shea? There are things you can do because you are different. Things You Can Do For Someone another, for someone special to you. Mother... Let's talk about the future. One day you will meet wonderful people outside the Sea of ​​Trees. Yes, I think it will be the same people like you, Shea. Like me? There is no chance that you are so alone ... in this big and wild world. Outside the Sea of ​​Trees ... They are. Of course. Yue-san, promise, remember? Yeah! Promise to let me join you! OK, I will keep my promise. Hajime, let's take it with you this useless rabbit. That's why you fought? Unfortunately. I beg! You can go with us, but I'm not going to reciprocate. The future is not predetermined! Do not know? I believe that if I will try, then I can change it! I always wonder, in the end ... When I can’t change the future, I think it would work out if I tried better. That is why I will not regret it anymore! This is a dangerous journey. Then I'm glad I'm a monster! Thanks to this, I can go with you! It will be difficult for you to arrange life in my homeland. It does not matter! All? So I won, right? Won My feelings ... They won. Do as you know, freak.
