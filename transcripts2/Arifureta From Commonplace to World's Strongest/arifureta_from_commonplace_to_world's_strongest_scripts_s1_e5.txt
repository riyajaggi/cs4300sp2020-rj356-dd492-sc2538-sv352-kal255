 Lair of the Traitors. Here? Well then, what happened? Then... The door opened and I found this place. After I put Hajime on the bed ... It looked like this as if holy water began to act and I used all my strength ... I'm sorry to trouble you. Thank you. By the way ... Why am I naked? You were dirty, so I washed you. Why are you licking your lips? What is this smile for? Did you do something to me?

 Stop licking yourself! Where did you get so much clothes? Was the traitor a man? 29th I found a lot of different clothes. thirty So we should look around. Yue, what are you up to? My size is not. Clear... The sun? It can not be. At night, the ceiling is like a starry sky. This is a very large house. I looked around a bit but I couldn’t get into some rooms. Yue, do not relax your guard. A real bath! How by the way how much time has passed since I took a bath? Let's go together? I would prefer one by one. Library and workshop upstairs locked, huh? Check the third one? Right. In the third there is only one room. It seems like that. As if he was waiting for someone. This room may be the key to the path to the surface. fifty My turning skill doesn't work and to sealed rooms ... Yue, if anything, support me. Yeah. Be careful. My name is Oscar Orcus. I am the creator of this maze. You are well done, once gone my trials got here. I believe that the term "traitor" is familiar to you? So you... Please refrain from questions. This is, nevertheless, just a record. Sorry, I can’t answer your questions. But I want to tell the truth about the world those who have come this way what we fought for and why did you leave this message. Already sixty-fifth ... Yeah we finally got to the deepest of the floors reached. Right. First i worried how it would be but everyone has become stronger. I'm honestly surprised. Though you say so but you did a good job yourself. Do not compare with you, Hero-sama. Get together! The level map is not complete. We are concepts don't have what can happen. Clear. To stand! N-can't be ... Is he again? Didn’t he die? Hippopotamus... Nobody knows the time the rebirth of monsters in the maze ... but here is the return to life of some defeated monsters - the ordinary. He's coming! Do not forget about the escape routes! Meld-san, the current ones are not the same as before! We are a hundred times stronger! We won’t lose now! We will definitely win! Right! Eternal defeat does not suit us! Payback time! You... You won’t take anyone else. We will win and pave the way further! Soar up at a speed thousands of wings ... Heavenly Flash! We can! Shizuku, the left flank! Hii is behind! Meld-san, the right flank is on you! Rearguard, prepare the highest magic circles! Oh, orders without a doubt. I will not let! My fury breaks the firmament! The power of Hercules! Now, faster! Crumble to dust turn into dust, become ashes! Overpower! So hard? Let me! May all this supreme blow be cut! Incision! May this soft light envelop you! Soft Radiance! Bright flash! Oh heaven, give them your strength! Recovery! He is still strong even with a broken horn ... Everything, get ready! The enemy of God will not disturb His holy land! Herem! I will not lose! Blessing of heaven reveal your secrets ... Strength! Thank kaori I love you! The shining sun! Overcoming the Limit! W-win? Have won! Yes! Victory is ours! Hurrah! What is it, kaori? Ah ... Ah, Shizuku-chan. N-nothing. Just thought about that we finally did it. Right. Kaori? I don’t know who you are and why you came. I just want you to know. I will give you my strength. Use them as you wish. However, please do not use for evil. Force? Enough talk. Thank you for listening. Hope you will able to live their own free will. What is it? Something creeps into my head .... Come on... Hajime? They are not evil gods or traitors, they were just rioters ... What do we do? I told you earlier:Me not interested in this world. I'm going to my homeland. That's all. You care? My place is here. The rest is worthless. Oh ... And also, it seems I learned new spell ... ancient magic. True? It is called the magic of creation. I can add energy to the raw materials for special properties. Can you create artifacts? Yes, it seems. Hajime is amazing! Do you want to learn this too, Yue? But I do not know how to convert ... Well, perhaps so, but still it is ancient magic. From what you learn, there will be no harm. If so says Hajime. Well? Have you learned? Yes, I did. But the artifacts are complex. Here is how? Apparently ancient magic may not be suitable for everyone. In this case, this place is now ours, so why not take care of his body? We fertilize the field. Bingo. I found Yue! It looks like this circle connected to the surface. But to connect, we need the Orcus ring. No problem. I took it when I buried the body. So the whole workshop is full of artifacts Oscars and a variety of materials? It would be better for us to grab them. Hajime, look. So this is how it works. If I go through other mazes, I'll get my hands on it other forms of ancient magic? Maybe there is magic of return. Right. I think we will do so. Let's go through the remaining mazes! There are a lot of things. What? You know, Yue, let's stay here for a while. I want to get to the surface, but here a lot of things to figure out. And if we are going to go through other mazes, you need to thoroughly prepare. Together with Hajime everywhere is good! Here is how. Perfect. Nicely? Yue-san, you know, I told you I want to stay in the bathroom alone ... At least cover yourself! After all, the towel is full! On the contrary, look. You know, Yue. To put it this way ... Do you like me? N-not like that! Actually very. I'm glad. I am all for Hajime. Look at your health! P-right on target. What? What, you ask? Ay, I'm going out! I will not let go. Hey wait! We are ready. I ate all the meat of the monsters. The equipment is also ready. It took a long two months. Yue, my arms and powers are not normal to the surface. Holy Church and others kingdoms will not be silent about this. If it were only them - everything would be alright but the gods can also target us. Perhaps the whole world will turn around against us. Dangerous adventure. Our lives may not be enough. Late. I will protect you, and you will protect me. We are the strongest. And we will destroy everything and everyone ... and transcend this world together!
