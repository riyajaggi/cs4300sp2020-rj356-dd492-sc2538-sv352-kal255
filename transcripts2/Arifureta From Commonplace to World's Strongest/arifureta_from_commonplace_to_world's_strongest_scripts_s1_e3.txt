 Quick Step! There is something to be done with this hard shell... What? He can control the earth around him... But this is my ability! Very tasty. Azure Heaven! Are you okay? Supreme magic is exhausting... I know you're tired, but can you do it again? I can, but it will be less... Enough. Remember where I shot from Donner? Yes.

 When I give a signal, attack. Yeah! Well, we started! Yue! Why? Why didn't you run away leaving me? I have not fallen so much. You were terribly betrayed, and then you entrusted your safety to me. What kind of man am I if I did that? If I remember correctly, vampires were destroyed in the war three hundred years ago. Three hundred years ago... So you, Yue, are at least three hundred years old... How rough. Can all vampires live so long? I'm special. Regeneration does not allow aging. A special kind of magic... Yeah... By the way, Yue, do you know where we are now? Or do you know the way to the surface? I do not know... But they said that this maze was created by one of the rebels. Rebels? In the Age of the Gods... the messengers of the gods took up arms against their own deities. Were there people who went against the gods? They said they were going to destroy the world, but their plan was broken, and they took refuge in the so-called labyrinths. So it turns out that the Great Labyrinth of Orcus, too? Yeah. And, it seems, on the very top floor of the labyrinth its creator may be. In the deepest place of the abyss? If we get there, we may find a way to the surface. Clear. Someone who owns the magic of the Age of the Gods could surely easily create a path to the surface. Ore Shtar. Ore with a high affinity for magic. The more mana it absorbs, the stronger it becomes. That's why it is so hard. What are you doing? This is a rail version of an anti-tank gun. Relay...? Did you see my gun, Donner? This is a very powerful weapon. And shells too. But I'm going to use this wonderful material to make weapons more powerful. Ok, done. His name is Schlagen. Why are you here, Hajime? Why can you directly control mana? Why eat monsters? Are you a man at all? What's with the left hand? P-Wait! I’ll explain everything, just wait! And so, where to start... Once, God Et called us into this world. We were told that we must save humanity from demons. However, my specialty - synergist, was not very suitable for battles. Everyone said that I was useless. Here we came together with the royal guard to clean the maze. And in the middle of the battle with the Hippopotamus, I was betrayed by my own classmate, and before I realized this, I fell here into the abyss. The monster ate my hand, and I was on the verge of death... But I decided to survive by any means. So I used my powers to kill monsters... and ate them. What happened to you? Hajime... it hurts... it hurts me to hear that. Do not worry. I don’t care about classmates. I'm not even going to take revenge. More importantly, I want to get better at what will allow me to survive. I am going to find a way to my homeland. And I will put all my strength into it. To return? Well yes. Well, a lot has changed for me, but I still want to go home. Clear. I have nowhere else to return. I don’t need the past anymore! Any name you give will do! Well well... Then come with me, Yue? I say, to my homeland. Well, there maybe it will be boring, in the human world without magic, but I think we can handle it somehow. Only if you want, of course. Are you sure? Kingdom of Heilig. Status: Open! Amanogawa Koki, profession: Hero. It seems like you are getting stronger. We will continue practical exercises in the labyrinth with the current composition. I hope you prepare accordingly. Yes! That's all. Failure is not acceptable, yes... Ok guys! Let's practice well! Yes. Damn it! Do not give up, Hajime. You are too relaxed! What is wrong with these dinosaurs ?! How many do not kill, more and more of them! Their number is gradually growing. This is strange! And what kind of flowers do they have on their heads? They are nice. Yes, never! You saw what happened before... These flowers are probably... Parasites. Do you think so too? Something must drive them. Yeah. If we don’t kill the one who controls the flowers, we’ll fight monsters from all over the floor... Where? Where is the real one? Hey vampire princess? Could you stop drinking my blood? Force Majeure. Yes, right now! You couldn’t get so tired! It looks suspicious... So we will be safe for some time. I tried well. If you really think so, then why don't you get off me? Nothing to do about. And now. They were damn annoyed so I guess we guessed right. Do not lose your vigilance. My sense of presence notes nothing... Heck! Yue, this is probably an attack of the present. Do you know where? Yue? Run... Hajime! Is it because of the green balls? And you're not so bad... Hajime... forgive me... What? I got resistance by eating monsters. This trick won't work with me! Stop it! Bastard... Not! Hajime, everything will be alright with me! Shoot! Yue... Hajime... Shoot! Can? It makes everything a lot easier! Do not look at me so. Well? Are you okay? You fired. You said it yourself. You didn’t even doubt it. Well, from the very beginning I wanted to shoot. I knew I was going to, but... But? If I shot her without saying anything, you would probably be angry. It seems to me that you cut... a bit of my scalp. But are you recovering fast? So no problem. Will you, Yue? I don’t need to. Well, since you survived three hundred years in prison... Are you not hungry I was... but now everything is in order. In order? What did you eat? Your blood. A. So that means you don’t need food when you can drink blood. I can get nutrients from food as well. But blood is more effective. Clear. Why are you licking your lips? Hajime... delicious. Mature taste. P-mercy... I will not let go. Time to eat. Finally, we are on the hundredth floor. Hajime, you are more careful than usual... Yes, if you count from the place where I failed, this is the hundredth floor. Maybe there will be something here. Something? Well, just in case. If there is anything here, then it is behind these doors. Are you scared, Yue? While I'm with Hajime, everything is in order. Excellent!
