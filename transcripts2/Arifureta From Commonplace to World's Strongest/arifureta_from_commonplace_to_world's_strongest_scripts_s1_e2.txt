 Further there is no point - The level is no longer growing. Since I can't find the way up Then I will go down. With the help of turning walls, I can move around the floor. It should turn out to move to other floors. Rumor has it that this maze has a hundred floors. But what am I on? It's dark, even though the eye is gouged out A light source can cost me life, but...

 Depths of the Abyss 29th floor. Depths of the Abyss 44th floor. And now, so what did you find on the twentieth floor of the great labyrinth of Orcus? Kingdom Heilig Throne Hall. We found a new kind of trap that looks like a shining crystal. He instantly sent us to level sixty-five. Hmm... deeply. This is the deepest of the achieved levels, and at the same time, the hippo's den. Our battle with him and the soldiers Traum was... in vain. The rumor about the death of one of the hero chosen by God is spreading throughout the Kingdom. Do not say anything more about this. Do you get it? Yes.

 Do you agree with that, heroes? What?! Hippopotamus! So this is... 65th floor! The deepest of the achievements... Take the newcomers and break through the soldier Traum! The rest, hold back this monster! - We then... - Fool! Run while there is a chance! I will definitely save you. So... I rely on you! That's all! Get out of there, man! We will cover! The second volley, or! Why here ?! Nagumo-kun! Wait! But Nagumo-kun... Nagumo-kun! Kaori! Let it go If we do not help Nagumo-kun... Kaori! It's impossible. I promised... I promised to protect him! Kaori! Nagumo-kun! You did the wrong thing! Koki Thanks. We cannot lose any of you. Clear. Well, you can open the way for us. Get out of here together. Yeah... That's right! Welcome back to Tortus. Let me officially greet you, great heroes, and your servants in our Kingdom. According to Ishtar’s father, There are three races in this world: People and demons, as well as half-people. Humanity and demons have been involved in a bloody war for centuries... But the demons learned to control monsters, tipping the scales to their side... Humanity is now on the verge of destruction. To prevent this, the god worshiped by the people of Tortus, Et, called heroes with incredible powers - us - to his kingdom. People of this world are in danger. We cannot leave this. I'm going to fight to save everyone! Ah... Amanogawa-kun ?! T-this I can not afford! No, I definitely cannot allow this! I, as your teacher, must keep you safe! I'm with you. I don’t want you to fight alone. D-even if this is not my responsibility... You are all very dear to me! Now we have no other choice. Shizuku! Hey, Amanogawa-kun, are you listening to me? When your teacher says, you have to listen and answer her, okay ?! Kaori. Sad... to the teacher... Guys, you can’t! It is impossible! Listen carefully! We will head back to school as soon as possible! Until this happens, you are still my students, and... Something is wrong. It is not that simple... All is good. Nobody will know. No one saw me... Everything is going fine. All is well... Hiyama-kun? Yaegashi? What happened? N-nothing? And you have? I'm just training. If you do nothing, I will rust. Why don't you practice too? N-no... I... Has Hiyama-kun always been like that? If you think about it, he was always pestering Nagumo-kun. Even when we came up... Does Hiyama-kun likes Kaori? Of course not. Kaori! Thank God... Shizuku-chan. How are you feeling? In order. Just a little weakness. You slept for five days, it would be like that with everyone. So long? Why? I seem to recall. We were in the Labyrinth and... Hey, are you thirsty? I cant remember. Where is Nagumo-kun? Is he alright? Did we save him? Right? You see... Stop! It's impossible! Kaori! Shizuku-chan, let go! Kaori! I have to go! Nagumo-kun is still waiting! He must be very sad alone in the dark! I have no idea how deep this place extends. I have already passed fifty floors. Maybe I can find what I’m looking for behind that door? Just like a Pandora’s box. So... what hope lies beyond this door? I will return home. I will survive and return home. And all who will interfere are enemies. And I’ll kill the enemies! I don’t understand. I practiced a lot, but I have never seen such a thing. Maybe this place is very ancient? Nothing to do. Will have the old fashioned way, Turning... Heck! Yes, cliche is cliche. Sorry, but I see what is happening, and I won’t wait for you both to come out to fight you! Protective Spells... But... I already know your weakness! His hand gets in the way. Hey what's up with you Fight, come on! Can't get far from the door? What is it there, since you don’t want to show me this? Here! You have nowhere to go! Here. And now... what were you guarding there? Shizuku-chan, I believe with all my heart... that Nagumo-kun is alive. Kaori... I know. It is unlikely that he survived. But you know, until we make sure, the probability is not zero. I... will become stronger. I will become stronger and make sure with my own eyes! Shizuku-chan... Help me please! Good. I will support you. Thanks! Don’t thank, are we friends? The magic stone? I believe this monster is the key. I will eat meat later. First... Who! Human? I apologize. W-wait! Please save! I refuse. Why? I will do anything! You know who in their right mind will save one whom, obviously, were sealed here on purpose! I'm in a hurry! Not! It's not my fault! Wait, I... They betrayed me! Heck. Did you say “betrayed”? But that doesn't explain the reason to seal you, even if you are telling the truth. Why did the “traitors" seal you here? Hey are you listening If you don’t tell me, I’ll leave. I am one of the long-lived vampires and have amazing power... I tried for the benefit of the inhabitants of my country. But one day... the minister said that I no longer needed... My uncle said that he would now rule himself... And I didn’t care. Are you from the ruling nobles of a kingdom? But they said that I was too dangerous... And since they... could not kill me, they sealed me... Could not kill? Fast regeneration. Even deep wounds are not terrible. Is this your "amazing power"? Also... I can directly control mana... I don't need circles. True? And the truth is unnatural power. She sure makes you immortal. Help. What I'm doing... As expected, it does not give in... But now I... Not all! Will you drink? You are warm. Actually, I'm still alive. What's your name? Hajime. Nagumo Hajime. Hajime... Hajime, Hajime... And you? - Hajime... What's your name? Name it. What? To call? Really forgot? I don’t need the past! Any name you give will do! No need, you know... N-well, since you ask... How about Yue? Yue? Yes. In my world, it means moon. Moon? When I just entered your blond hair and red eyes reminded me of the moon in the night sky. How? Now I'm Yue... Thanks! Hajime... Hajime!
