 My mom was picked up by ICE last night. - Did you tell Jessica? - I can't be a problem to her. Yoli, this is your mom. All those people at the apartment forced out of their homes... I was too guilty to tell them that I'm staying here. I wish I could go to that conference with you next week. What, you're not going? Come with me. People will wonder why I'm there. - What's going on, Nicky? - It didn't go as planned.

 He's dead. He's got you on tape, Nick! Aah! I have to go get Ickaris for McGann. She's right. He has you. - You know I owe him. - If he can do this, it's more than owing... what are you into, Bobby? You killed Tommy Diehl for McGann, didn't you? Running isn't going to solve the problem. Let me help you. I got conned by the immigration lawyer. What do you mean "conned"? He just took my money, and he never showed. Either you tell Jessica, or I will.

 When I was a waitress after college, I made sure to put a few dollars in a jar after every shift, no matter how much I made. It took me so many shifts to get that money. He just took it. I'm so stupid. It's not your fault. And I'll make sure you get that money back. It's not even about the money. I'm so mad at myself. I was so wrapped up in my own life that I didn't even remember she was going into ICE. And I always remember. She hugged me so tight, and I didn't even pick up on it. You couldn't have done anything. She was going in anyway. I could have told her that the climate's different now. I could have told her that they're looking for reasons to throw people out of this country. And I'm sure she knew that. Yoli... you knowing she was going in would not have prevented her from being detained. I know. Am I that much of a monster that you couldn't tell me? No. I've just been messing up so much since I got here, and... I didn't... You didn't want to be the source of any more drama. Yeah. And now look. First of all, you haven't been messing up. You've been a godsend. And second, this isn't drama, Yoli. This is life. And right now you need someone who's on your side. I need someone to bring my mom home. Can you do that? I can't make any promises, but the first thing we're gonna do is find you a real lawyer. - Derrick Mayes. - Hey, Derrick. It's Stephanie Novak. Mrs. Novak, how are you? I'm well. Hey, how's your mom? She's still talking about that shepherd's pie recipe you sent her. Well, give her my regards. Um, listen, Bobby left in such a hurry. I was thinking, that speech on health care... it's really important to him. Yeah, he actually wrote that one himself. It was pretty good, I hate to say. - He can write when he has to. - Yeah, don't tell him that. I don't want to lose the little job security I have. Don't worry, you're not going anywhere. So is someone going to be giving the speech in Bobby's place? And please, God, don't say Lloyd. I mean, he is the sweetest man, but he will have people sleeping by the second paragraph. I'm not sure what the plan is on that, but I can check in with Keri, since she's the one going. Keri's going? Uh, when was that decided? A few weeks ago, I think. I'm not really sure. Are you there? Sorry. Yeah, I'm... I'm still here. - Should I have her call you? - No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure that Miss Allen has everything under control. Um... thank you so much, Derrick. No problem. Oh, Bobby. - You Nick? - You got what I asked for? Brand-new .38. You got the money? I was never here. Whatever it is, save it. I'm already late for the airport. - Bobby's not going. - I know. You know? When'd you find out? Last night. He's, uh, going to Seattle to wrap up the Ickaris deal. Yeah, that's what he said to me, and I didn't buy it then. Where is the Wyatt brief? Somebody has to file this while I'm gone. Come on, Keri, the press is gonna ask why he's skipping the conference to wrap up a deal he just said he wrapped up. - I need something. - What do you want me to say? You were right? You were right. What is that supposed to mean? It means that the CEO thinks that Bobby stole all the glory, and now he's pissed because we went public without him, so they're trying to squeeze us on the details. Might say I told you so, but I guess you just did. Gloat much? By the way, I just spoke with Stephanie Novak. She's going with you. - Where? - Los Angeles. She said she's feeling good, and she wants to go. I thought you liked her. - I do. - Okay. Then... Yeah, great. Yeah, thanks for the heads-up. Aha. I see you still have your New York number. Don't get any ideas. I'm happy where I am. - Did you get my message? - Yeah, I did. It turns out my friend Ivan from Harvard is the top immigration guy at Sidley. - And? - He won't take it. Well, maybe Sidley's too big for this. Well, that's the thing. He checked with three boutique firms, and they all say the same thing... it's a loser. They haven't even met the woman. He said they don't have to. Unless she's seeking asylum or has some great story to bring attention to the firm, it's just not worth their time, Jessica. Damn it. I thought you were out of the pro bono business since you took the job with the mayor. I am. This is for my new assistant. Her mother's undocumented. You're a good woman, Jessica Pearson. - Uh-huh. - I'm serious. You always treated me like family no matter what I did. I just hope this young woman realizes how lucky she has it. Right now she's not very lucky at all. But thank you, Louis. - You're a good man. - I miss you. - I miss you, too. - You do? Can you just repeat that so I can record it - and play it back for Harvey? - Losing you. I said, can you just... can you just repeat it so I can play it... Here, go ahead. What... Jessica, what'd you say? Jessica, what'd you say? "I said I miss you, Louis." All right, thanks, Jess. Bye, Louis. Have you seen Keri? It's a legal question, and it's time-sensitive. She's out. - Is this about Yoli's mother? - So you know. I tried to convince her to tell you, but she kept saying that she got this, even after that scumbag lawyer ripped her off. Well, here's your chance to help. Give it to me. Find a way to get her story in the press. Shit, that's not exactly what I had... If it can happen to a Dreamer working at City Hall, it can happen to anyone. Let's see a judge try and deport her while the whole city's watching. I already went behind Bobby's back once. I can't do that again. No, I'll take the heat from the mayor. No, it's not about me. If it gets out that the mayor's office is playing favorites in an immigration case, my credibility, Bobby's credibility... it falls to zero. Look, there's nothing more I want to do than help Yoli, but I can't cross that line. I respect that, but you know I'm not going to stop trying. - I wouldn't want you to. - When does Keri get back? Wednesday. She's going to LA with the First Lady. Excuse me? Yeah, Ickaris is blowing up. Bobby had to go to Seattle. He didn't tell you? No, this is the first I'm hearing of it. Is everything okay with Keri and Mrs. Novak? Of course it is. I just don't like being kept out of the loop. Did you set up that lunch with the Chamber of Commerce? Yeah, 12:30 at Brass Heart. Was that okay? I can switch it up if it's too... Cancel it. We're gonna see your mother. Now? - You want action, don't you? - Hell, yeah. Yes. I mean, um, thank you. Are we gonna meet the lawyer there? I'm your lawyer for now. I thought you weren't a lawyer anymore. I'm not, but all I have to do today is take your mother through the process and let her know what to expect. So what about her hearing on Friday? You can't represent her there. I have some calls into a few clinics. "Clinics"? That's your idea of a real lawyer? - Nuh-uh. No, no, no. - Yoli. No, I'm going to make sure she at least gets a court-appointed defender of some kind. - Yoli. - I'm not asking you to do it. I'm gonna find one myself. It's going to be fine. Yoli, your mother's not a citizen. She's not entitled to one. We're gonna get through this. I promise. I thought you didn't make promises. I'm changing my policy. Mrs. Novak. - So the rumors are true? - Sorry? I heard you were also going to the conference. Oh, yeah. Last chance for some color before winter. Please, look at me. I will definitely be the palest person there. - Here, let me help you. - No, no, no. I got it. - Excuse me. - Sure. I hope I'm not intruding. Bobby asked me to deliver his speech. Oh, no, not at all. I'm... Public speaking is not my thing, so I'm glad. Well... I hope you're not too bored, then. No, I have a lot of business to attend to. There's actually a panel for City Attorneys. Oh, good. I was worried that you were just coming along to fill in for the mayor. Nope. Like I said, lots to do. Oh, good. Fasten your seat belts, please. Oh, yeah, can I give you... Thank you. You know, I was thinking about it on the way over here... what little time you and I have spent together. I mean, you've been with my husband for how many years? - Almost two. - Oh. This is long overdue, then. Mami. Yes, this is my boss, Jessica Pearson. Hi. You're the famous Ms. Pearson. Thank you so much for taking care of my Yoli. It's your daughter who's taking care of me. That's very sweet. A-are you also a lawyer? - Oh, she used to be. - It's a long story. But the bottom line is, is that I'll be able to petition the court on your behalf. You'll have an actual attorney for your hearing. Yes, you're going to have an excellent lawyer, so don't worry. - I am so nervous. - Don't be. It's just a bond hearing. The hearing to fight deportation is in a few weeks, and all you'll have to do there is be completely honest. Mami... My mother immigrated from Cuba when she was a teenager. I'm the daughter of an immigrant. So you know. When we had Yoni, we wanted to give her the best life and the best education. When she was two, we had put together enough money to get across the border. This is our home now. I don't want to go back. And I don't want you to, Mrs. Castillo. But these people... they already have you. And now they're looking for any reason to send you back. - I don't understand. - If you've done anything since being in this country, if you've done anything at all that you haven't told me... Ms. Pearson just wants to make sure - that nothing goes wrong. - I didn't mean to offend you. I just want to make sure that you're prepared. Hang in there. We're gonna get you out of here. I don't get you, Ms. Pearson. One minute you say you want to help my family, the next you're interrogating my mother like she's a criminal. I didn't say she was a criminal. - Well, it sounded like that. - No. But I do think she's withholding something. See? Oh, my God. I know it hurts to hear... Yeah, I don't want to hear it. Yoli, when you keep secrets long enough, you begin to sense when other people are doing the same. Yeah, well, check your spidey senses 'cause you're way off base. - Yoli. - Way, way off base. And if I'm not? The sooner we know... My mother doesn't lie, Ms. Pearson. When you clean other people's houses for 20 years, when you're around their children, when you're around their jewelry, when you're around their money, you don't work if you're a dishonest person. My mother doesn't lie. Angela. Is that room almost ready? We're getting backed up in the ER. - I just finished. - Okay, Mrs. Smith up on 7th needs to be bathed, and then... Actually, I was wondering if I could take off early? Early? You're signed up for a double, and you already missed part of last night. I know, but I got someone to cover me. - Who? - Roxanne. - Roxanne, who... - I can find someone else. It's okay. If you have to go, go. Thank you. Angela, you're one of my best CNAs. That's why I recommended you for the nursing program. But this isn't a fast-food place where just anyone can fill in. If you can't make this job a priority, then maybe nursing isn't right for you. No, it is a priority. Actions... that's all I'm saying. - Hey, Mo. - What's up, Miss Angela? I hate to ask, but... how you doing on leftovers? Ah, damn. Don't tell me things are that bad with your family. - No, we're good. - You don't have to pretend. I heard they tore down your project. Yeah, now there's a whole encampment set up... parents, I mean, kids, elders. - But you're okay? - Yeah. I'm staying with a family friend. Well, thank God. You don't need your kids on the street like that. I wish I could do something, you know? But I don't know what. Anyway, if you got any food you could spare... Hell, yeah, I could spare some. Hey, look, you come back tomorrow and the next day and the next until folks are back on their feet. - Okay? - Mo, thank you so much. All right, don't go crying on me, now. Make my food all salty. Come on. - You still want to help Yoli? - You know I do. Then I need you to find out what her mother's hiding. What are you talking about? I got a good bullshit detector, Derrick, in English and in Spanish, and I know she's keeping something. And if it comes out in her bond hearing, it's game over. If she won't talk to you, why would she talk to me? She wouldn't... but Yoli might. You just said her mother's the one lying. I said she was hiding something. I didn't say Yoli wasn't aware of it. Shit, why are you always asking me to cross the line? She trusts you, Derrick. It's the reason why she came to you and not me. Yeah, and you're asking me to betray that trust. I'm asking you to put your reporter hat back on and get me something, because if you don't, Yoli's clinic lawyer is gonna get rolled in court and her mother's gonna be deported. And I know you don't want that. Way to guilt me out. Hmm. It's the greatest motivator in the world. Do you know any of these people? I know him. Not the Novak I expected, but definitely the one I prefer. Where is the other half to your better one? Ugh, well, it was either cover for him here, do a little public speaking, or cover for him there and keep the city afloat. You know, mock trials only prepare you for one of those. Yeah, that's right. You eviscerated me back in 1-L. Well, how are you? I mean, you look great. Ah, thanks. I'm good. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, Mayor Mark Taylor, this is Keri Allen... - Bobby's right-hand girl. - Ah, pleasure. We prefer the term City Attorney. - City Attorney? - Yes. Yeah, you must have your hands full with Bobby over there. Intense mother.......... - He keeping you busy? - It's a big city. Speaking of, I hear you are announcing Chicago's take on that health care initiative that gave Palo Alto such a headache. Yeah, well, come on, you know Bobby's no stranger to headaches and neither am I. Plus, this one we are really passionate about. Yeah, I can see that. It's not another all-talk-no-action move. We think this one might actually do some real good. Listen, I'm with you. We tried, too. We couldn't get around all the legal crap that sunk the others. I'm curious... what was your brilliant solve? - Well, we started... - It wasn't rocket science. Actually, we just established that it was not only constitutional in the language of the measure, but we built in fines for violators to fund city enforcement. Well, I see why Bobby appointed her. Anyone want a drink? - I'm fine. - I could use another. Ah, wait till tomorrow. It only gets worse. After you. Thank you, sir. Keri? Yeah? So handy. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to abandon you down there. Oh, you didn't. I wanted to come back and go over the speech, especially since you added that part about San Jose. Yeah, I hope that's all right. I agree with Mark. I see why Bobby hired you, but since you did, do you mind helping me make some changes? It's his speech. I... Well, now it's mine, and I'd like to make some changes. All right, do you mind if I grab my wine? No, not at all. Would you like a glass? - Hmm? - Of Chardonnay. There's a bottle in the room. No, I'm fine. Thank you. Do you not drink at all? I have MS. But you know that, right? Because it's hard to work for someone for... what was it that you said... two years? And not know everything about them, right? Okay, so much for the speech. This is why you came. Give me a little more credit than that. As the mayor's wife, I have certain responsibilities, and this is one of them. Can I ask how long you've known? You don't get to ask me anything. Okay, I'm gonna go back to my room. What's wrong with you? I'm not doing this with you, Mrs. Novak. Please, stop calling me Mrs. Novak, all right? It just adds to the perversity of our situation. I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. I'm not looking for your pity. I'm not giving you pity. It happened, and I'm sorry. And I don't... I don't know what else to say. You are a beautiful, accomplished woman who has been with my husband for five years. Not two... five. And in all that time, you have just let yourself sit around and wait for scraps. You must think pretty little of yourself to put up with that. You found the one quiet spot on the whole floor. What you working on? Well, the best way to bring my mother home is to show the judge that she has roots in her community. So I am going to tell my story. DACA. - Mm-hmm. - That's brave of you. Yeah, well, she's the one that's locked up. I just need to get up there and not make a fool out of myself. Well, you know I do help write speeches for a living. Okay, flack. Listen, I'm good. Thank you. Well, you need to do a little more than not make a fool out of yourself. If you're gonna go the whole DACA route, you need to be 100% accurate. - Why wouldn't I be? - No, I'm just saying. I mean, look what they did to your mother. She followed all the rules, and they still locked her up. Just remember, when you're reading that in court, you're under oath. I can't believe this. She put you up to this, didn't she? What? What are you ta... No, no, no, don't lie to me. You can't come here accusing me and my family of lying by lying to my face. She's just trying to help you. We both are. My mom didn't do anything wrong. Yoli, come on. Is it possible you don't know? No, okay? Because my mom's my best friend. And if she were hiding something, I would be the first one to know. I'm assuming you're with the Mayors' Conference. Wow. I'll take that as a "get away from me creep." I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was mean. I'm Keri. Josh. Comms Director, Denver. City Attorney, Chicago. Well, now that we've shown each other our résumés, we could move on to SAT scores if you want. Or you could go back to your "stay the... away from me" creep vibe. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm not usually this much of a bitch. Oh, sure you are. Look, it's fine. I'm sure you get hit on all the time. I'm sure it gets pretty tiring. It's just, you know, for me, um... I don't do the online thing, I see you're not married, and I don't dare get involved with any of the women I work with, not these days, anyway. Yeah, it's definitely not a good idea. So, when you meet someone who's obviously like-minded, obviously smart, and obviously hot... You get where I'm going. What was your name again? It's Josh. Josh... Comms Director, Denver. Josh. Thank you. What's wrong with you? It's late. I'm gonna close the door, and I'm going to bed. No, you asked me. I want to ask you. What's wrong with you? Okay, I think you've probably had too much to drink. You don't want to say something that you're going to regret. - I love your husband. - Oh, God. That's why I put up with the scraps. - Okay. - That's why. What's your excuse? You've known for five years. You don't get much more than I do, I mean, what happened to the woman that I met downstairs, that perfect political wife, greeting and gliding? What happened to her? Where did she go? She got sick. Bullshit. You knew long before you got sick, and you did nothing. You didn't say a word. You just stayed. And you still stay. So where's your self-esteem, Mrs. Novak? Ms. Pearson. Jessica. Oh, so now it's Jessica? Well, since I broke the case open, I figure I could take some liberties. That depends on what you got. I believe Yoli when she says her mom isn't hiding anything. Those two are close, but it got me to thinking. What if what her mom is hiding happened before they even got into this country? I got some dates from Yoli's job application, and then I pulled this article from the Reuter's archive. Look like anyone you know? Stephanie? It's close to 11:00. They're asking where you are downstairs. Is everything all right? I can't do the speech, Keri. You don't look very well. Um, can I get you some water? I'm gonna get you some water. Thank you. I'm sorry about last night, and I'm really sorry if what I said had anything to do with this. This just happens sometimes, all right? It's just part of the deal. - Is there anything I can do? - Yes. Don't tell anybody. Why are you keeping this to yourself? Because Bobby asked me to. I thought you were the one that wanted it this way. No, Bobby thinks that if we went public, people would think that he couldn't possibly focus on his job. That's ridiculous. You shouldn't have to bear the burden of keeping this to yourself... that's not fair to you. It doesn't matter. Okay? He asked me, I promised, it's my job, and it is none of your business. Oh, my God. What are you doing? I'm sitting with you until you feel better. Okay, well, it could be a while, all right? I might feel like this all day, so... Then I will wait all day if I have to. You're making that speech. You really hate public speaking that much? Drink your water. Yes, ma'am. - Angela. - Did you get my message? No, I didn't. I've been wrapped up in something. I was at North Park last night. There's at least 100 people living in tents. - I didn't know. - Yeah, no one knows. - That's the problem. - I'm so sorry. Can I call you back later? I'm trying to keep my assistant's mother from being deported. So you have time for your assistant but not your own family? Of course I have time for my family. It's why I'm letting you stay with me. - "Letting"? - That's not what I... You know what? It's okay. I got it. Angela. Angela? - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's nothing. You forgot I know Steph. She's never late for anything. You promise you'll keep it to yourself? Hmm. Wardrobe malfunction. I kid you not. Good afternoon. I'd now like to introduce the First Lady of Chicago, Stephanie Novak, to speak about her city's health care initiative. Stephanie. Thank you. People ask me all the time why my husband and I are so passionate about the issue of health care. They ask me, is it personal? Is it political? The answer is simple. It is very personal. I have my health. I'm lucky. My family has their health. They're lucky. But for the millions who live in America's big cities today who don't, we are not doing enough for them. Dinner will be served in 15 minutes. I've prepared an affidavit for you to sign. It's okay. I know everything. And now that I do, I need you to sign this and testify to it at your hearing. I cannot. Mrs. Castillo, this is your only chance for asylum. Without asylum, you will be deported. I thought you said they were looking for reasons to kick me out. - I killed two people. - Two gang members. It's still murder. I raised Yoli to do the right thing... always to do the right thing. They were children, Ms. Pearson. The youngest one didn't even shave. I saw his face after I shot them. I'm no better than they are. What happened to those boys was done by the gangs. - Not you. - Yoli won't see it that way. Your daughter will understand what you did. She's a wonderful and forgiving young woman. Yes, but it changes everything. I kept this from her, and... she'll never trust me again. Of course she will. She'll never see me the same way. You keep this from her, and she'll never see you at all. Is that what you want? Please... sign it. Going somewhere? Angela. What happened? I can't just sit up in here and live like a queen while our friends are on the streets. Don't you think it's killing me, too? But there's nothing we can do about it. Oh, God, you sound like Jessica. Everybody's ready to throw their hands up and forget about the people we left behind. Don't you dare talk to me that way. Your cousin did everything in her power to change the situation. Well, I haven't done everything in my power. What does that mean? It means I'm not leaving them behind. Living on the street homeless is not gonna change anything. No, but living right across from City Hall might. Angela, you have babies. They may not understand what I'm doing now. Hopefully someday they will. Angela. Stop! Derrick said you were looking for me? I was. Sit down, Yoli. "Sit down" is never good. What's going on? Please just tell me. Your mother just signed an affidavit asking for asylum. She doesn't have a case for asylum. All I know is what she's swearing to. So she's lying. Would you like me to read her statement? "On March 17, 1994, "when my daughter was two years old, "two young men broke into our home in Guanajuato, Mexico. "Based on their distinctive tattoos, I recognized them "as members of the violent gang Mara Salvatrucha. "My husband was at work. "I was home alone, and I had a baby. "I feared the worst. "So I picked up my husband's shotgun... "and I shot both boys. "Fearing payback from the gang, "my husband and I took our daughter and fled to America. - If I am sent back"... - Okay, stop, stop, stop. - Yoli... - No, I-I don't believe it. - No. - I know it's hard to hear. No, there's no way. Like you said, your mother doesn't lie. No, it's all... that's a lie. How could she not tell me? My whole life? This is exactly what she was afraid of. She was willing to leave the country... instead of shattering the image you have of her. This can't guarantee her asylum. This could get her deported. She told the truth. That's all she can do. That's all any of us can do. I want to see her. - Can I see her? - No, it's too late. - Visiting hours are... - Yeah, I know, over by 8:00. I hate that place. Thanks, Jessica. I guess everyone's calling me Jessica now. I know, bud, but you know the drill, right? Homework first, then TV. Okay, well, I'm on the way, and Daddy will be home soon. Okay, sweetie. I love you. Here you go, ma'am. Oh. Thank you. It's only a recommendation. I mean, most of the literature says they don't know either way, so... Mmm. I want to thank you, Keri. For what? For getting me out of the house, for lighting a fire under my ass. Is this the part where you tell me to stay the hell away from your husband? No. I mean, I think a part of me did come here to say that... and just to get a good look at you. This isn't about my husband. This is about me. I've been letting this disease and you define me for far too long, and I think I'm done with that. You can't possibly say that you don't care. Oh, I care. It's just, what can I do about it, Keri? I can't cure an addict. I tried to end it five years ago. I swear to God I did, but I see your husband every day. We're around each other all the time. - That's your choice. - I don't want another job. - I like what I do. - Like I said... that's your choice. So where do we go from here? Home. It's Nick. I can't take your call. Leave one for me. Hello? Anybody home? Lillian? Oy.
