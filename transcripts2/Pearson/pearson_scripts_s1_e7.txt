 Previously, on "Pearson"... My mom was picked up by ICE last night. - Hey. - [crying] I'd like you to start digging into some longer-term projects for me. Ickaris's second headquarters. You sure you want that headache? If that headache comes with half a billion in construction, I'll take it. Who the hell is Albert Chan? He's a 30-year-old billionaire

 who's buying up half of Chicago. It's time to move on. I couldn't agree more. If I don't push back on that greedy son of a bitch, my guys won't support me. The developer got an emergency permit, and there's no way to stop it. You know you can stay with me until you get on your feet. - Hi. - Jeff gave me his key. Oh, he did, did he? What we need is someone who wants to stick it to McGann as much as I do. The mayor is looking for a new primary donor. You want to make him obsolete? - This is your chance. - Who's Tommy Diehl?

 He was a Teamster boss back in the day. - What happened to him? - Disappeared. Body was never found. There are rumors McGann had something to do with it. Who do you think you are, going to Thomas Lauder - for finance? - Business, Pat. - I own you. - You don't own shit. Pat McGann dropped this off for you. [♪♪] [click, tape whirs] It's Nick. Um, I need to talk to you. Something happened. Um, pick up if you're... - What's going on, Nicky? - It didn't go as planned. All right, God damn it, stop mumbling. He's dead. [tense music] Did you hear what I said? Jesus Christ. [sighs] I took care of it. [recorder clicks, thuds] He's got you on tape, Nick. You knew I called him that night... - I told you then. - Yeah, I didn't know - he **** taped it. - What difference does it make? He's been holding this over our heads for years. The difference is now I know he's got proof. I'm the one on that. I'm the only one who's ever going to pay. You don't think that takes me down? I can't be connected to that. [breathing shakily] He'll never use it. Yeah, he'll use it if he gets desperate enough, and believe me, he's getting pretty desperate. Maybe you should've thought of that before you backed him into a corner. - What, you mean Jessica? - Look, all you had to do was let him keep backing you, and none of this - would have happened! - He's got you on tape, Nick! [♪♪] No one would shed a tear if he fell off one of his buildings. You listen to me. I don't want you going anywhere near him. I'll deal with Pat. Hey. You understand? [♪♪] All right, one more, and then we got to go. "Explicit." Good morning. E-X-P-L-I-C-I-T. Explicit. - Whoo! - Yes! Nice. Is there a spelling bee coming up I should know about? - Next week. - Well, Mama won the spelling bee when she was a kid. - Did she? - Citywide, under 12. No biggie. [laughter] All right, boys, get yourselves together. - We got a train to catch. - Thank you. I had no idea you guys were up this early every morning. Yeah, the hazard of being on Lake Shore. The extra stops add time, so... I can have my driver take you. Uh, no, you've done enough. And, besides, a driver? Really? Well, just for this morning, if you want. All right, just this once, okay? I don't want them thinking they're Richie Rich. Oh, wait, there is one more thing. I know you have a lot on your plate, but if you don't move out of your apartment, it's not going to be there much longer Uh, yeah, I know, I have a double shift today. Okay, well, if you want, I can... I can try to find a moving company, or I can go there myself... No, no, it's fine. I know where everything is, and the boys wanted their 360. - Their what? - Exactly. You wouldn't know the first place to look. [laughs] His Honor! See what's going on out here? We've come a long way, you and me. You son of a bitch. You know, I've always known what you are, but that guy? To see his face, to know you trapped him. Hey, I didn't plan it. It just happened. - Yeah, lucky for you, right? - Hey, you pushed me, Bobby. You got no one but yourself to blame. You're the one who tried to run away from home. Yeah, that's not going to change. - What was that? - You heard me. Tape or no tape, you don't have the cash to keep me in City Hall... The Lauders do. You sure you want to play it this way? Listen to me, you prick. They put up the money, you still have the influence. That's what you want, right? Where I come from, that's called a win-win. [tense music] - You hear what I said? - Yeah, I heard you. Just trying to figure out whether I believe you or not. Seeing Steph last night reminded me what a good liar you are. Oh, I'm not asking for permission. I got your message. Now you have mine. Back off. [♪♪] Hey, boss! That Albert Chan guy called again. Tell him to come down to the site. I think he's going to like what he sees. [♪♪] [walkie-talkie beeps] Take it down. [♪♪] *PEARSON* Season 01 Episode 07 [♪♪] *PEARSON* Episode Title: "The Immigration Lawyer" [♪♪] *PEARSON* Synchronized by srjanapala [distant siren wailing] [tense music] [♪♪] - Hey. - You ready yet? Just about. Thank you for taking care of my family today. [groans] It was above and beyond. Oh, the silent treatment. I'm sorry I asked you to run a personal errand. It was, um... out of bounds. What's out of bounds is you sticking your nose into Bobby's money. Since when do you care about campaign financing? Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. The mayor brought me in to fix his problems, - and that's what I was doing. - Yeah, fix them. Not create a goddamn rift when there wasn't one to begin with. You know, I don't know what mayor you're driving around, but the one I see is struggling to breathe under Pat McGann's fat thumb. Yeah, it's called debt. Welcome to Chicago politics. Oh, judging by your reaction, I'd say the debt is about a lot more than just money. What happened, Nick? Now that Bobby's trying to get his freedom back, McGann showed his hand, didn't he? [elevator bell dings, door opens] - How bad is it? - Are you going to work or not? [♪♪] "Lift our cities to greater heights." There's nothing wrong with a little soaring rhetoric. It's a Mayors' Conference. It not the keynote address at the Democratic Convention. Oh, these days, cell phones, iPads. - Everything's a keynote address. - [knock at door] That better not be your "bad news" knock. It's my "I've been in a room negotiating for 24 hours" knock. I told you they wouldn't budge on the tax break. Actually, we've come to an agreement on all major issues. What, you reached a deal? It looks like you're the winner of the Ickaris sweepstakes, Mayor Novak. [chuckles] [laughing] You are the best. If you want, I could leak something to the press. No, to hell with that. Bring them in. I'll tell them myself. Are they okay with us making an announcement? Wait, wait, if you go public and this thing blows up... I'm talking to Keri, Derrick. You never wanted this thing in the first place. They're probably okay with it, but you are giving them leverage on some of the details. She's right. What if they have their own contractors from out of Seattle? What if they want to get out of MBE? You're getting way ahead of things. I have to be ahead of things because you're about to go face the nation out there and you're not even prepped. Why not wait a day? - I have the Mayors' Conference. - So wait a week. I'm not waiting! Make it happen. [tense music] [♪♪] [camera shutter clicking] Since the proposed site is at Lincoln Yards, doesn't this continue to focus job growth on the North Side instead of the South and West Side, where unemployment is the highest? I reject the idea that neighborhoods are pitted against each other. If one succeeds, the other fails? Neighborhood growth isn't just about business. - It's about people. - Sir, some of your critics are saying this is another example of backroom deal-making. It's how deals get done, Malik. I think the 4,000 people about to get a job are pretty happy about that. - Is there a question? - The question is, what promises were made to lure Ickaris to Chicago, when will the details be made public, and have similar promises been made to contractors bidding for the work? When the deal is signed, I'll read it to you myself. And I guarantee you, we'll go through all normal bidding procedures. "Guarantee." Really? Yes, "guarantee." How's that for a politician? Excuse me. [♪♪] [sighs] That okay with you, boss? I'm going to hold you to that. - I'm sure you will. - Nice press conference. I guess my invitation got lost in the mail? - Give us a minute. - I got work to do. Is this your way of punishing me? For what? I thought you weren't interested in Ickaris. After all, you pawned it off on your assistant. McGann's not interested either, but it seems that he was the only one you were speaking to out there. - Is that a fact? - You and I both know why I wanted you to cut ties with him, or at least you do now. I want to flush him out, find out exactly what he has on you. And based on my conversation with Nick, it's a lot worse than you thought. You didn't flush anything out. If I didn't, you wouldn't have scheduled that little performance to show McGann that you're still the man in charge. [soft music] [♪♪] [sniffs] Why are you doing this, Ms. Pearson? - Doing what? - This, all of it. You're a wealthy woman. You've got nothing but money and time. You didn't need to take this job to help. You miss the games, the backstabbing, everything that goes with it. You like the power. Admit it. I'll admit that when you tell me what's got you and Nick so rattled. - That's a deflection. - That's not an answer. Tell me, Mr. Mayor... if Pat McGann killed Tommy Diehl... what does that have to do with you? [♪♪] I already gave one press conference today. [♪♪] [laughs] How's that for progress, huh? Yeah, we should be breaking ground within a week. Congratulations. You should be very happy. No, that's we, my friend. Yeah, my guys are busting their asses around the clock to give this shithole the proper shine it deserves. I can see, but you're going to have to do it on somebody else's dime. What are you talking about? Well, my people ran the numbers back home. We don't like what we see. But this lot is a gold mine. - You just called it a shithole. - Well, for right now, but it's ripe for the picking. This whole goddamn neighborhood is. Well, the truth is residential is for chumps. Concentration of assets, tenant risk. A man of your stature should know this. No, what I know is that your bank ran the numbers on that months ago. And months ago, you were a player. Now... not so much. You're a high-risk investment. Sorry, Pat. I liked hanging with you. Good steaks. You ever climb out of the hole you're in, let me know. [tense music] [♪♪] It wasn't my idea to sideline you from the Ickaris deal. - I don't care about that. - What do you want? I care about the mayor, and based on the fact that you're going out of town with him, I know you do, too. [sighs] - What are you doing? - I'm not judging you, Keri. - It sounds like you are. - No, I'm here because something's going on with the mayor, and he's not telling me what it is. Something's always going on with Bobby. Do you want to be more specific? The mayor I know doesn't grandstand in front the press, especially after what happened to him with me. I don't know what to tell you. - You came to the wrong person. - Come on, Keri. You don't share a bed with someone for five years and not know their secrets. - Wow. - I'm sorry to be so straightforward, but this is important. What is it that you think I know, Jessica? I'm hoping you know what Pat McGann just dropped on him. Yeah, uh, I'm sorry. I actually really can't help you because... he doesn't share those secrets with me, and the reason he doesn't is you. - Me? - Yes, you. He brought you in to shield me, believe it or not. I think his exact words were, "She's already dirty." [scoffs] I'm sorry to be so straightforward. [dramatic music] I really am sorry. If I knew, I would tell you. But I don't. [♪♪] Can I give you some advice? If it's about my relationship, I would rather you didn't. Whatever the mayor's telling you, as long as the two of you are together, he can't shield you. [♪♪] Any way we could do it today? I've got back-to-back meetings all day, Ms. Castillo. Please, look, my mom's not a criminal. I-I just can't stand to see her locked up like that. I'll tell you what. You're at City Hall, right? - Yes. - Can you meet me at that Jasper's place across the street in an hour? - Yes. - I'll be at one of the back tables. Okay, thank you, thank you. - Remember Frank Cramer? - Local 305 president. Not anymore. He got voted out. Went back into business as a contractor. - I need an address. - Got it, Frank Cramer. And when you're done with that, I need you to go to Buildings and Permits and pull a list of all the outside contractors and the work that they've done for the city over the past year. Vendors, suppliers... I need all of it. That department closes early on Tuesdays. Well, then you better hurry up, because I need it now. [♪♪] Yoli, you've really stepped it up since our talk. It hasn't gone unnoticed. [♪♪] What's going on with your mom... did you see her? She's wearing an orange jumpsuit. Damn. What can I do to help? Do you need a lawyer? No, I got a lawyer. I'm supposed to meet him in an hour. Supposed to? What does that mean? It means that Jessica just dropped a shit ton of work on me. Now I have to go to Buildings and Permits - before it closes. - Screw that! She can't expect you not to have a personal life. Tell her that you have a personal issue. I can't do that. I can't lose this job. Yoli, this is your mother we're talking about. My mom came to this country to give me a better life. If I lose the chance for one, what was the point? That's crazy. Yeah, well, it's what she wants. She made me promise. - Well, at least let me help. - No, please. I can handle it. [♪♪] [keys clacking] Um... I just talked with Jessica about your announcement this morning. Oh, I'm sure she thinks I'm getting out over my skis. She thinks you got spooked by McGann. Everything is about that guy to her. [chuckles] That's not an answer. Oh, Jesus. Don't tell me you two are a tag team now. - That's not a fair fight. - No. But you've been acting really impulsive lately. You nearly bit Derrick's head off this morning. - Something's eating you. - What's eating me is I just beat out 18 other mayors to get this project, and I'm about to see every one of them in I.A. You don't think we keep score? So this whole thing is about bragging rights? Yeah, it is, but it's also about momentum. If I go in there as a winner, I have the juice to push my health-care initiative. Okay, well, if there is anything going on with McGann, you can tell me. He knows about us. He doesn't scare me. He shouldn't. McGann's a headache. No more, no less than anything else I have to deal with. Instead of worrying, you should be thinking about I.A. [♪♪] You are so full of shit. Work on your speech, winner. [♪♪] Aren't we brave today? Oh, not my first time at a construction site. Maybe not, but I bet it's the first time for those Saint Laurents. You know your shoes. Hi, my name is Mia, and I have a problem. It's a small problem, but the collection's fierce. Hello, Mia. I'm looking for Frank Cramer. Right through there. [tool whirring] If you're looking to shut me down, this place is up to code... Same deal with my workers. I'm not looking to shut you down. I'm here to help you. I can't wait to hear this. How would you like to have the construction contract on the Ickaris project? [laughs] Look around, lady. Does it look like I can handle a project of that size? Why don't you let me worry about that? You're serious. Why are you doing this? Because I feel sick about what I did to you. - I'm not buying that. - It's true, Frank. What I did to you and your family haunts me every day. Good, it should. But someone like you doesn't do anything out of the goodness of your heart. It's always transactional. So tell me what the hell you want, or get out. I want to know about Tommy Diehl's disappearance. Drop dead. You've been around the unions 30 years, Frank. - You know things. - Yeah, that's right. 30 years it took me to get where I was. - And you took it away. - Then let me help you. I hate Pat McGann every bit as much as you do, and if I'm going to do anything about him, I need to know about Diehl. You're living in a fantasy world. - About taking down McGann? - No, about getting us that bid. None of your clout's going to make that happen. We're a start-up that does gut rehab. And without that woman out there, I don't even get that done. Well, like I said, you let me worry about that. And if I can get it for you... Yeah, sure, knock yourself out. Yeah, get me the contract, then we'll talk. [scoffs] I need to talk to you. [exhales sharply] Um, something happened. What do you mean something happened? It didn't go as planned. Oh, God damn it. Stop mumbling. He's dead. [click, tape whirs] He's dead. [click, tape whirs] He's dead. [click, tape whirs] He's dead. [♪♪] [dramatic music] [♪♪] Shit. Excuse me? Excuse me? Hi, was someone just sitting here? Suit and tie maybe? Um, there... There was a guy here, but, um, he... he just left. Okay, thanks. [groans] [cell phone clicking] [line trilling] This is Richard Meyers. I am out of the office or in court. Please leave a message. [beep] [♪♪] - Got a minute? - I do. Have you seen Yoli? Well, the girl's allowed to leave her desk, you know? I didn't say she couldn't. Is that what you came in here to tell me? You asked. Let's start again. What can I do for you, Derrick? Well, with all due respect, you can start by telling me why it seems like you're interested in construction bids on Ickaris. If you must know, I'm interested in getting that contract for Frank Cramer. So you think that's how it works? We just hand out favors... [snaps fingers] Like that? - No legitimate bidding process? - It's important, Derrick. I wouldn't do it unless... Unless you owed him something. I don't doubt that. But there's no way Cramer's getting that job. Why? Because he's undermanned? We can pair him with another team... - No, it's because he's white. - Excuse me? Bobby made a commitment to award at least 10% of all city contracts to minority-owned businesses. MBE... Minority Business Enterprise. And do you know how many we've handed out since then? One. I didn't like this whole development to begin with, but if I'm going to keep being his press secretary, I'm definitely going to hold his feet to the fire. I didn't know about the program. And from now on, I promise - I will work with you on this. - Uh-uh, no "from now on." We're doing it now. I don't know what backroom-favor bullshit you got going on, but I am not with you on this. - Derrick... - When you came in, I thought, "Maybe there's somebody who will put cause above politics." No attachments, no baggage, no debts. But now I know why Bobby brought you in... 'cause you're the biggest, baddest operator around. [♪♪] Yeah, I-I know we talked about February. I-I just want to see how a few things pan out. Dad, what's wrong? You sound down. Ah, it's just these guys out here. They don't have the same work ethic as they used to. Yeah, I'll call you later, sweetheart. Not now, Nicky. Don't you fucking Nicky me. You have any idea why I called you that night? You were always more of a father to me than that piece of shit that slept with my mother. - That's why. - Hey, Pete was a standup guy. He didn't have to look after you. - He didn't. - You did. You were the one who was there for me. I leaned on you for everything... How to drive, how to throw a splitter. Hell, you're the reason I got into the Academy. I'd run through a wall for you, and you know that. And this? This how you reward that? I didn't want to use it, all right? - Bobby left me no choice. - Bullshit. You could've destroyed that thing a long time ago. - You had a choice. - You had a choice, too. Nobody told you to kill Tommy Diehl. Right. "Take care of him"? Right. You better get out of here, Nicky. Or what? You going to take care of me? [♪♪] You know what you showed me with that thing? You showed me that you're nothing without someone in City Hall ready to make a deal for you. [♪♪] You're nothing. You ungrateful son of a bitch! [♪♪] Aah! [breathing heavily] [♪♪] [McGann groans] [♪♪] Motherf **** [breathing heavily] [cell phone clicking] [line trilling] [line clicks] Superintendent's office. Yeah, it's Pat McGann. Get me Superintendent Hargrove and tell him one of his guys assaulted me. I'll give him the message. [♪♪] [door slams] - Where's Nick? - Outside, I assume. - Why? - You didn't hear? Oh, Jesus Christ. What did he do? Well, it seems like you already know. God damn it, Chuck, just tell me. He went after Pat McGann, broke two of his ribs. [scoffs] [sighs] I'm surprised he could find his ribs. Okay, well, all the fat jokes aside, this is no joke. - I know. - McGann is no joke. - I know. - He's threatening action against the department if I don't - take his badge away. - Oh, shit. Now, look, I gave him to you because I know what he is to you. I'll talk to him. - The kid's got demons, Bobby. - I said I'll talk to him. [dramatic music] [♪♪] [light music playing over speakers] [door opens] [chuckles] Okay, I see how it is. So this is how it goes down every evening. No, sometimes I have an army of little men who fan me with palm fronds and feed me grapes. You know that joke doesn't work when you got... all of this. [laughs] - Can I get you a glass? - Hell, yeah. [♪♪] [sighs] - So how was your day? - [grunts] Oh, lots of fun. Just... another day of sponge baths, gunshot wounds, and angry patients. Thank you. And... then I had to go back to the apartment and grab some things, quickly come back here to drop it off, and then go back to work. [♪♪] - Hard going back there, huh? - Beyond. All those people forced out of their homes. They're just like, "Angie, where you been at? We didn't even see you leave." And... I feel so guilty to tell them that I'm staying here. You're a good person, Jessica Pearson. Am I? [♪♪] What's going on, cousin? [♪♪] Just, um... a man I-I did some business with got in my head a little bit, that's all. How so? [♪♪] The words he used... He, uh... he described me as transactional. Transactional. Sounds like one of Cory's spelling words. - I'm serious. - I know you are. And I know you're not doing all of this for something in return. - I get joy in my home. - You know what I mean. You didn't have to let us stay here. What about those people you just left in the projects? I'm not helping them. You can't change things single-handedly. I tell myself... I took this job to make a difference. And sometimes I... What? [♪♪] Sometimes I think I'm... that same ambitious woman who ran that law firm. [♪♪] Then don't be. [♪♪] [indistinct chatter] [light music playing over speakers] - Ms. Castillo? - Oh, my God, Mr. Meyers. - Hi, hi. - Hi. How are you? Oh, my God, I am so sorry about yesterday. Oh, I-I-I wasn't trying to be cruel, but I had another appointment. No, yeah, I'm sure you're very busy these days. Yeah, well... So can you get my mom out of there? Is she claiming asylum? Oh, no. No, no, she's not. Um... Well, I-I'll be honest with you. In this climate... Mmhmm. Asylum is really the best way to stay in. But I'm usually able to get a hearing and a temporary release. - You mean a bond. - Yeah, okay. I have... Here... Here's $1,500. Um, that's just for the bond. But you do know my fee is another $600? [dramatic music] N-no, my... my dad said it was only $1,500. For the bond. [♪♪] Okay. Um... Uh, look, you know what? You... you can owe me the rest. - Really? - Yeah, just don't tell anyone. I'm trying to make a living here. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Hey, look. I-I have to get to court. I'm so sorry. Oh, absolutely, yeah. Okay, um, we'll talk, right? - I'll be in touch. - Yes, thank you. [♪♪] Come on, boys, I don't want to wake Grandma. Baby, what are you doing under the couch? - He can't find his bear. - I thought I got your bear. The little bear. [sighs] Oh, I'm sorry. - Can you go back? - I can't. I got to go into work, baby. Well, listen, when things quiet down tonight, I'll try to slip out and get it, okay? - Promise, Mommy? - I promise, baby. All right, let's go. Let me guess. First one in, last one out. Frank's at a meeting. Should be here any minute. I'm not looking for Frank. I'm looking for you. If you want someone to roll on Frank, look somewhere else. He told you about me. I don't like what you did to him. Frank's family. He's always been there for me. And yet he never made you foreman, did he? I did my homework. You were a rock star at that union. You'll have to ask Frank about that. No, I think we both know why. What kind of a union boss would he be if he let a woman run his crew? Look, I'm not trying to drive a wedge between you two. I just want you to get what you deserve. And how are you going to do that? [♪♪] $800,000? What's this for? Your half of Frank's business. What makes you think it's for sale? It will be if Frank wants the Ickaris contract or any other development coming down the pike. [♪♪] You want to make this a minority-owned business. The mayor has made a commitment to the community. I don't know. I don't like it. Now, I know what you're thinking. It's not fraud. It's an investment in you. 51% of the company is in your name. You pay me back when you can. And I'm sure you'll still be the first one in and the last one out. [♪♪] You wanted to see me? - Sit down, Nick. - I don't want to sit down for a lecture, Bobby, so let's just get to it. You're going to cop an attitude after what you did? I told you to stay away from him. You're not the one going to jail. - I'm not what? - You're not the one going to jail if that tape comes out. I'm the fucking mayor! I'm so tired of this "I'm on an island" martyr bullshit. You are not alone. It's you and me. How many times do I have to tell you that? Good. Then I did your dirty work today. Can I go now? [scoffs] [♪♪] I don't know, Nicky. You don't know what? [♪♪] Did you call me in to suspend me, Bobby? You put me in a hard place. Yeah, and you can do whatever you want. I'm not your boss. No, Hargrove is. And you're his. Or maybe it's McGann... or Lauder... or who the hell knows anymore. [♪♪] [badge thuds] [♪♪] I'm not interested in your payoff. It's not a payoff. You expect me to believe that, coming from you? No, I don't, but I am trying to offer you an opportunity. You're saying I'm getting the Ickaris contract? I can't make that promise, but if not that, it will be something else. Because this puts me in the MBE as long as I give up control of my company. 49% of something is better than 100% of nothing. Do you really want to do gut rehab the rest of your life? - I'd get by. - Look around you, Frank. The world is changing, and there's a reason you brought Mia over from Local 305. You're saying she hasn't earned this? All of this to find out about Tommy Diehl? Nope, I'm trying to make things right. So... go ahead, take it. Leave right now. You don't owe me a thing. [dramatic music] [♪♪] You know, Diehl wasn't a friend to anyone. He had his crew, but he was a criminal. He stole from everyone, and he blackmailed everyone. Who took over the union when he disappeared? For a while, Bobby's old man did. He took over, and suddenly, McGann had no problems with the unions. [♪♪] Go ahead, ask, I know what you're thinking. Did McGann kill him? Did he? McGann's too smart to get his hands dirty. He's always had bagmen to do things like that for him. I have no idea who did his dirty work for him then. You don't need to. You know who does it now. [♪♪] [indistinct chatter] [♪♪] [elevator bell dings] [♪♪] Ms. Pearson. I'll be driving you tonight. - Where's Nick? - I don't know, ma'am. I just do as I'm told. [♪♪] Last time I was in here, you weren't so nice to me. I was hoping this time, I'll get a little better treatment. I suspended Nick without pay. Happy now? Yeah, it's a start. I had to stand in here and suspend my own brother. That's not enough for you? I could've gotten Chuck Hargrove to do that. I didn't need you. [groaning] What do you want? I've decided to put Ickaris on my site. [♪♪] What the hell are you talking about? Think about it, Mr. Mayor. I get a more profitable development, and you deliver a shitload of jobs to the 54th. I-I believe you call that a win-win. That deal is signed. I went public. You and I both know that's not true. You were just trying to show me who's boss. Look, there's no point having a tape if I won't actually use it. And I will use it, Bobby. I'm under it, my old friend. I got nothing left. Chan pulled out of North Park. That was my last shot. [♪♪] Christ. [♪♪] We can both go down, or we can both survive. I'm the last person Ickaris wants to sit down with. [♪♪] They'll never trust a word I say again. [♪♪] Well, then you better get on the first plane to Seattle and make them. [♪♪] [door opens, closes] Shit! [groans] - Hey, do you need help with... - No, thank you. I'm good. Thank you. Thanks. Look, I know you think I'm always trying to save you or some shit. Are you okay? I got conned. What? I got conned by the immigration lawyer. What do you mean conned? He never showed up to my mom's bond hearing. He just took my money, and he never showed. Are you sure it wasn't some kind of mix-up or something? No, I asked around in court, and these people do this all the time because we're undocumented or we don't have any money, or... Oh, God. I don't know what else to do. [soft rock music] Look who's office you're in. - Derrick, I... - Either you tell her... or I will. [♪♪] [sighs] [♪♪] Oh, hi. Good, you can help me choose. I've been over-packing 'cause I never get to go anywhere, so... And I know they say it's way too cold this time of year, but I'm definitely going to... [sighs] Lay out. [♪♪] It's fine. It's fine. I have a lot of work to do here, actually. - No, you have to go. - What? - I need to go to Seattle. - What? Why? What happened? The CEO wasn't happy we jumped the gun. I need to go smooth some things over. Why didn't they call me? I'm the one that made the deal. I don't know. I guess they want to make me dance. You know, the funny thing about sleeping with your own city attorney is she knows when you're lying. - I'm not... - Please don't lie to me. - I'm not... - Don't lie... not to me. [dramatic music] [♪♪] I have to go get Ickaris for McGann. What? [scoffs] I can't get into it. [♪♪] Oh, my God, she's right. He has you. You know I owe him. No, if... if he can do this, it's more than owing him. What are you into, Bobby? [♪♪] I'll call you from there. [♪♪] [thunder rumbles in the distance] [door opens] [♪♪] - Going somewhere? - Yeah, something like that. I heard what happened. [thunder rumbles] Nick, no matter what's going on, I can help you. - You? - I know you don't believe me. What the hell are you doing here, Jessica? I mean, really? I'm trying to make a difference in this city. You keep saying that, but I don't - buy it. - I can't do a damn thing as long as the mayor is compromised. Then why aren't you talking to him? He's not the one running. [♪♪] [sighs] You killed Tommy Diehl for McGann, didn't you? [♪♪] Running isn't going to solve the problem. Not for you, not for your brother. [♪♪] I can help you. Let me help you. [♪♪] [car door closes, engine turning over] [♪♪] Synchronized by srjanapala
