 Breakfast is served. Thanks, Beast Boy. Everything looks great. On my planet, such a feast would mark the arrangement of a marriage. Tell me, Beast Boy, to whom are you engaged? That?s not eggs! That?s that tofu stuff! That?s not even real milk! Hey, Raven. Want breakfast? It?s good. Wakey-wakey, tofu eggs and bakey. Herbal tea. Come on, just one little taste. You could use a little food after the way you cooked Dr. Light. NO!! Maybe you should go apologize. Me? I?m not the one who just turned breakfast into a battlefield! Yeah, but after the weirdness that went down last night, you should know better than to go messing with her. I was trying to be nice. But no matter how hard I try, she still treats me like tofu eggs! You know, she?s never once laughed at any of my jokes. ?Least she listens. I just kinda tune you out. Raven is complicated. There is much about her we are not meant to understand. Then how are we supposed to deal with her? How can we even trust her? I mean- She?s our friend. What more do we need to know? Oh, well, nobody?s home. You might want to knock a little louder. Now we both have to apologize. Uh, Raven? Sorry about the door. Raven?  Dude, she?s not here. Come on. Looks like Halloween came early this year. We?re in Raven?s room. We should not be in Raven?s room. She doesn?t let anybody in here - ever! So this is our big chance to find out more about her. For instance? ?check out this beauty mirror. Who woulda thought Raven spends time sprucing? Ah! Is that a zit? Come on, B, we should really get out- -huh? Yo! Oh, man! I told you we shouldn?t have gone in her room. Uh?where are we? You?re asking the wrong robot. My sensors must be on the blink, ?cause they?re saying we?re in Titans Tower. Riiiight. So how do we get back? Guess we start walking. Come on. I?m serious. We?re on a rock in the middle of- If sending us to Weirdsville?s Raven?s idea of a joke, I am so not laughing. Hey, she didn?t send us here. You?re the one who went snooping in her room and popping zits in her magic mirror. Who booby-traps a mirror? Maybe it wasn?t a trap. Maybe it?s Raven?s way home. Maybe this is where she?s from. Definitely creepy enough. Turn back. Like I was saying? Turn back. Sweet! Betcha they can tell us how to get home. Careful. How do we know they?re not a threat? Hel-lo? Remember me? Beast Boy? If they were dangerous, I?d know. Hey, little guys. My buddy and I were wondering if- Get ?em off me! Get ?em off me! Cut it out! Hey, guys. What?s up? I don?t know anymore. Raven?! How did - where are - what just- -why are you wearing pink? ?Cause it?s my favorite color. It is? Look, I?d love to talk fashion, but I don?t suppose you know how to get home. The Forbidden Door. It?s the only way out, but you don?t want to go there. Not now. Uh?yeah, we do. ?Kay, but don?t say I didn?t warn you. Have you ever seen her this happy? Dude, I didn?t even know Raven could do happy. Now where are we? I think this might be where air fresheners come from. Good one! You?re laughing? At one of my jokes? Sure. I?ve always thought you were funny, BB. But hey, looks aren?t everything. Raven... ?you okay? We stopped by your room and the door?s been knocked down. Need to be alone. Many of your Earthly ways are still strange to me, but that was?just plain freaky. Correct? No. She ditched us! I can?t believe Raven ditched us! Next time I see her, it?s not gonna be pretty. Hey, I know where we are! We?re in that place where I didn?t know where we were before. Where were you? Shopping for robes? Whoa. Easy. I didn?t mean it. Please don?t- Hey! That?s that Forbidden Door, right, Raven? Come on, y?all! We?re almost- Great. Oh, man, we gotta get outta here! It?s a maze. You can?t get out. You have to go through. I can show you the way, but when we reach the end, you won?t like me anymore. He already doesn?t like me. Come on. That?s not? Gee, Raven, moody much? Yeah, she?s like a whole different person. And?remember the time I called you both immature pinheads? I?m sorry for that too. And also the- For the hundredth, millionth time? ?we forgive you! That?s the end. Sweet! All right, Raven! What? No way. Told you you wouldn?t like me when we got here. Now the salt. Stir continuously until thickened. May we go see if she is feeling better? She said she wanted to be alone. Yo! Eight-Eyes! Whoo-hoo! In your faces! Hoo-ah! High fives! Come on! What is your deal?! First you nuke breakfast- -then finally laugh at my jokes- then you?re all weepy, and now you?re a Marine? Make up your mind. Who are you? I?m Raven. Happy?timid?brave. You forgot dopey. Different sides of Raven?s personality. We?re not in Raven?s home. We?re in her head. And I want you out. The mirror you found is for meditation. It?s a portal into my MIND - NOT A TOY My bad. You have to go - now. Hold up. What?s going on here? Last night, something?got loose. Oh, no, you don?t! I?ve had it with this mystery-girl routine. I want to know exactly what we?re talking about here. Hatred shall rule. Let?s just say I have issues with my father. Azarath Metrion Zinthos! May we now go see if Raven is better? She wants to be alone. Get out of my mind! Now! And leave you alone with that? Not gonna happen. It?s my problem. I?ll deal with it. If I lose, you?ll be stuck in here forever. Go! Rage shall consume you. Yo! Sounds like somebody needs a time-out. You stayed? I thought you didn?t like me. Thought you didn?t like me. Yo, I like both of you. Now get your butts over here! Feel my fury! May we now- No! He?s too strong. Even with your help, I cannot defeat him. So call for backup! What about all those other you?s? Yeah, the green one kinda kicked butt. It still wouldn?t be enough. None of my other sides have the kind of power we need. Not alone - but what about together? They?re all part of who you are, right? Go for it! We got your back. You are going back where you belong! Never! We gotcha. It?s okay. Thank you?friends. So?we really are friends? And you really think I?m funny? Don?t push it. Please! Let us simply- Raven asked us not to disturb her! She could be weeping and- I don?t want to bother her! But if we merely- Where have you guys been? Just getting to know each other. Come, friends. We shall prepare a new breakfast feast. It?s a little late for breakfast, Star. Maybe just some herbal tea. Actually, breakfast sounds?nice. Breakfast for dinner? Coming up! Oh, no! I?m cooking this time! We?re having real eggs!
