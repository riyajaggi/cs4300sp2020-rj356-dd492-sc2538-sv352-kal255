 Teen Titans [01x05] - The Sum Of His Parts EN v1.0 Subtitles by Mr.Henky Soda? Why, I?d love one. Mmm-mmm, would you look at that. A little sunshine, a little breeze?only one thing could make this day better. Four and a half pounds of baby back ribs! Man, I love picnic food! Agreed, Cyborg. This tangy yellow beverage is truly delightful. Uh, Starfire? That?s mustard.

 Cyborg? Cyborg! What?s wrong with him? Is he gonna be okay? Shh. I think he?s coming to. Cyborg! Are you all right? Yeah. Thanks. What happened? Something musta gone wrong with my systems. Oh, man! My power cell?s dying. Dying?!? It?s only a battery. I?m fine. Happens every couple of years. Just a natural part of being unnatural. So what do we do? You keep playing. I go home and change batteries. You sure you don?t want help? Just ?cause I can?t have fun doesn?t mean y?all can?t. Sure was a nice day. Cyborg! Whoa, Cyborg! It?s really you! You?re my favorite ?cause, look! You?re just like me! Um?yeah, I?I guess I am. Cool! Nice meeting you, kid, but I got butt to kick. Cool! Thanks so much. You?ve been a wonderful audience. Now watch as the Amazing Mumbo vanishes into thin air! Mumbo-jumbo! Not bad for a matinee. Show?s over, Mumbo! Now hand over the jewels before the critics decide to trash your performance. Now, Robin, I?m sure there?s a peaceful solution here? ?but this isn?t it! Who said you could start the party without me? Cyborg?! What about your power cell? Go home. Get fixed. We can handle this without you. I won?t let you guys fight alone. And I won?t let you put yourself in danger. I got it covered. External battery pack. Teen Titans! Go! Nothing up my sleeve? ?and, presto! No! Need a hand? Azarath Metrion Zinthos! You think that?s good? Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat! Hocus-pocus! Pick a card, every card! For my next trick, I?ll require a lovely assistant. It?s only fair to warn you? ?I have no idea what I?m doing. I hate fighting dirty. Shall we clean you up? Cyborg? Cyborg! Exit stage left. Titans! He?s got Cyborg! Online. Charging. You are operational. That is good. What?s going- Rest, friend. Your new power cell is not fully charged. Who are you? I am called Fixit. You were broken. I have brought you here to be repaired. Where?s ?here?? Cyborg is not inside! And his locator signal is being jammed. This doesn?t make sense. Why would Mumbo want to kidnap Cyborg? Guys! Over here! I found something! I wouldn?t- Way to go. Charging is complete. The new power cell is functioning properly. Yeah. I?m feeling better. Lots better. Of course you are. I am Fixit. Things come to me broken. I make repairs. Let me see. Yes?yes?hmm?pity. Interesting. The damage is too extensive. Perhaps if we can find another processor. Well, thanks?for everything. You cannot leave. I can?t? You are not repaired - not fully. I?m not? My examination revealed many flaws - serious flaws. Serious? How serious? What?s wrong with me? There is no cause for alarm. More repairs are needed. More repairs will be made. But - I feel fine. Are you sure I?m- Quite. Will you remain? It is for the best. Well - yeah, I guess. Let me just tell my friends where I am. Something really is wrong with me. Rest now. You may contact your friends later. I am sure they are not too concerned. Maybe they should be. I?ll say this much for Mumbo - he?s an easy act to follow. Oh, I would commit myself to a life of muck-shoveling in the filth mines of Cornex if Cyborg could only be returned safely. He was malfunctioning. He shouldn?t have been helping. I tried to stop him, but he?s Cyborg. Mumbo-jumbo! Sorry, folks. No time for autographs. Titans! Get him! Open, says me! Ol?! Flowers for the lady. Abracadabra! I don?t get it. All my sensors say I?m fine. Your sensors are incomplete. Mine are more precise. Guess I?m just? ?getting kinda nervous. How long am I gonna be down here, anyway? Repairs could take some time. Besides, why would you want to leave? Look around you. Look at yourself. You belong with us. No, I don?t. I mean, you?ve got a nice place here and you?ve been really cool to me, but? ?I couldn?t live down here. I don?t know how you can. What do you mean? The power supply is adequate. Replacement parts are easy to find. I need more than that! What about sunlight? What about fresh air? What about food? I do not require these things. And when repairs are complete? ?neither will you. You know what? I?m feeling all right now. So thanks anyway, but I?m just gonna go. Stay. Yo, what are you- Hey! Let me go! Repairs are not yet complete. Your biological components are imperfect and must be replaced. No. Biological components removed. Repairs complete. Awaken, friend. Awaken and see your new face. NOOOOOOOOO!! Do not be afraid. You were dreaming. Sleep will not be necessary once repairs are complete. What if I don?t want to be repaired? What if I like me this way? Such thoughts come from your imperfect biological components. They will be replaced momentarily. Not if I can help it. Abracadabra! Alakazam! Hocus-pocus! You?ll never stop the Amazing Mumbo! Never! Ne- No more tricks! Where-is-Cyborg? How should I know? Where is he?!? You took him from the junkyard! What have you done with him? Nothing! Honest! When you broke the wand, you broke all my spells. Even if I had done something, it?d be over now. Poof! He?d be standing right here. If Cy?s not with him, then he?s still back at- -the junkyard! So, do I still have to go to jail? I thought so. I am ready. We will begin now. Perfect timing. I didn?t want to have to do this, but? Your defensive systems have been disabled for the procedure. They will be reactivated when repairs are complete. The biological malfunctions are growing worse. We must begin at once. His battery pack. He must have fallen down here. Star! Can you give us some light? Cyborg! Cy! Cybrog? Cyborg! Wow... h, any of you guys seen a dude about this tall with one red eye and titanium body armor? Teen Titans! Go! Do not resist. It is for the best. No, it isn?t! If you take out my biological components- -you take out the best part of me! The part that makes me who I am! Your memories - your ?self? - will be preserved. I will download them into your new brain. No?you can?t do this, please! You don?t understand! NOOOOOOOOO!! Cyborg! Are you okay? Yeah. So?beautiful. I had forgotten how beautiful. The world? ?through your eyes. Through human eyes. The same kind you have. Perhaps I am the one in need of repairs. And maybe I?m the guy who can help repair you. Cyborg! Hey, Cyborg! See? It?s Cyborg. He?s just like me! Whoa, cool! I am just like you. But it?s not your arm that makes us the same. It?s the stuff connected to it. Now, go deep!
