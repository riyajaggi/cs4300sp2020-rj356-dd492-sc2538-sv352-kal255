 Gee, I keep forgetting. You're only a robot. Say, Venus... How is our beautiful Dr. of space medicine? I gather by the compliment, Steve ...you want something to eat. I'm preparing a meal right now. I just adore your French cooking. What's on the menu today? Blue pills, pink pills, Or those delicious capsules that you make up? Boy, will I'll be glad to get back to Earth to have a steak! Calling navigation bay. Say, Prof. Matic, how are we doing? Are we on schedule? Well Steve, we are approaching position 15-0 Blue. And I'm registering -14G from the Moon. -14G from the Moon? That can only mean one thing. What's that, Professor? He, he, he! It's time to eat! Say, you gave me a scare. I thought it was something important. Space City to Fireball. Planatomic missile approaching Earth. Position 24-0 Red. Intercept. Repeat. Intercept! Go XL5. Abandon routine procedures. Intercepting enemy missile. Arming all warheads. Awaiting course instructions. Steve... ..where is the missile is heading? According to Space City it's heading towards Earth. We've got to stop it, Venus! It's carrying a planatomic warhead. A planatomic warhead? Why Steve, that's a million times more powerful than a hydrogen bomb. That's right. Our only chance is to explode it in space, as far way from Earth as possible. Is the Professor tracking the missile? Yup. He's getting me in position right now. Okay Steve. I'll go straightaway to help him. Ok, Venus. Good shooting! Steve, steer 1-8-4-0 Blue. Roger. All warheads go. Fire starboard thrust. Roger. Ok, Professor. We are on course. Maximum speed. Right, Steve. I'm switching to radar telescope. The radar telescope, Venus. - Radar telescope operating. - I've got it! Range: 24-25. Steve, we're gonna have to fire the interceptors at maximum range. That way we'll be clear from the radiation when it explodes. Roger Professor. Prepare forward interceptors. Roger. Fireball XL5 is dead on target. How are doing, Professor? In range now, Steve. - Stand by with interceptor - Standing by Range 2400. G Rate 2. 2400. G Rate 2. Master guidance system - UHF. Master guidance system - UHF.. Ten seconds. Ten seconds, Steve. Roger. Standing by to correct course. Six seconds to go, five, four, three, two, one, zero and go. What 's happened, Professor? The interceptor exploded before it reached the target. It was exploded by radio waves. There must be a crew on board. Yeah - a suicide crew. - Interceptor two. - Roger, Interceptor two. Venus, switch on jamming beam. Will do, Professor. Ten seconds. - He's done it! - Nice work, Steve. - You okay? - FIne Commander. What now? Steve, our computers have traced he source of the missile to Planet 4-6. Sector 25. Look's like it's your baby. - Good luck Steve. - Roger. Setting course for Planet 4-6 to investigate. Say, how about some coffee, Venus? I guessed we've earned it. I sure am glad I've got Robert as a co-pilot. How long, Steve, before we arrive at Planet 4-6? Oh, quite a few days yet, Venus. I ... I suggest we rest all we can. We don't know what's in store for us when we arrive. Say, how about that coffee? Oh, gee, I'm sorry, I'm a tooty I almost forgot. Fireball XL5? This is Space City. According to our calculations, you are now approaching Planet 4-6. Space City, Roger. Just going into orbit. We'll call again when we've carried out reconnoissance. Here we go - Fire main retros. - Okay, Steve. Firing retros. All right, Steve. We're in orbit. Robert is in the rear control center. You are clear to go. Okay, Professor. Venus and I will take a quick look around. If we need any help, we'll call you. I'll be standing by, Steve. Eh..Take care of Venus. We don't want to lose our Dr. of space medicine. Sure thing, Professor. Safety belt fastened? - Safety belt fastened. - Here we go. Steve, do you really think that the missile was launched from this planet? Well, Venus, that's what the computers say. We have no evidence that there's any life on Planet 46, although it does have an atmosphere. What worries me Steve, is that the computers in Space City are very rarely wrong. Sure. That's why we're here. Let's unfasten our safety belts and go out and investigate on our Jetmobiles. Oh good. They've landed safely. See what I mean, Venus? No sign of life. No plants, no water. Nothing. Yes, but this could just be the barren part of the planet. No, it's all like this. Prof. Matic has carried out extensive surveys of the planet from space. Gee! This place gives me the creeps. Nothing but rocks and craters. ...and boy, is it cold! Steve, look! Caves! This could be the answer. I'm a tooty. Why didn't I think of that before? Come on, let's go. Look Steve - diamonds! Thousands of diamonds! It looks like we've stumbled upon something, Venus. Come on. Venus! Stop! Venus, on the other side. Look! A door! This can only mean one thing - life. I'm going across, Venus. You stay here. If anything happens, get back to the ship right away and get help - fast! But Steve. Steve... Steve, what's wrong? The forward thrust motors have failed. Must be the heat. My speed has dropped but I can still make it as long as the hummer jets don't stop. Turn back, Steve. It's too late. I've got to keep going now. Steve, you're almost there. Venus, I made it! Oh, Steve. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-hahhhh (Shoots weapon at Steve) Venus... Get help ... fast. (Venus screams) Steve Zodiac, ..you appear to have recovered from the effects of the coma ray. What's happened to Venus? Your earth woman is quite safe.. for the moment. Where is she? She is out there in the rocket that will be launched against Earth, in exactly eight minutes from now. You're bluffing. Am I? Commence launching procedure. Ok, what do you want me to do? Very simple. Instruct your spaceship to land. - And if I don't? - You will. Fireball XL5, this is Steve Zodiac. I've discovered launching bay and have occupants held as prisoners. Bring her down, Professor. I can't carry them all in Fireball Jr. That's boss, Steve. We're on our way. Robert, landing procedures. Position Code 22-0 Red. Landing procedure underway. Excellent, Steve Zodiac. Now instruct him to land at position Code 22-0 Blue... and your Earth woman will be released. Fireball XL5. This is Steve Zodiac. That's right, Professor. Land in position Code 22-0 Blue. But ... but...but Steve ... No questions, Professor. Just do as I say. Please! Ok, Steve. Robert, change landing procedures. New position Code 22-0 Green. Changing landing position. to Code 22-0 Green. Correction: Blue. Repeat: Blue. Understand. Blue. Ya..now, now, now, Robert, it's no need to get all steamed up. We all make mistakes. I know you think I'm a bit of a toot, but I'm only human. Good. Now, Steve Zodiac. Observe. They're sinking into the ground. They are indeed. All is going according to plan. Your spaceship will sink in the ash. The beautiful Earth woman will die when the rocket hits its target, Earth... ..then it is your turn. You have already cost us one failure. So much for your word as Subterrane. Silence, Earthman! Proceed with launch! Resuming count down at minus 40. 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, Robert, restart the motors. Robert, what's the matter? Are you there? 12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Ignite. Fault on guidance mechanism. Change guidance frequency. (Speaking in Subterranean space language) Rocket now under control. Guidance system functioning normally. Don't worry, Steve Zodiac, Unlike Earth men, we do not make mistakes. That's what you think. It's no good, Robert. We ... we can't get her out of this without Fireball Jr. What's happened to Steve? Fireball XL5, from Steve Zodiac. I'll be with you in a moment, Professor. Once we get the nosecone attached, we'll be able to pull Fireball out from the ash. Hurry, Steve! ...We're almost ....completely ...submerged .... Okay, Professor, I'm back. Firing main boosters. All right. Instruct your Subterranes to abandon the missile with Venus. If you don't, we'll be forced to destroy your planet. Now...transmit. This is your Subterranean chief speaking. Abandon missile with Earth woman. Repeat: Abandon missile with Earth woman. I have passed on your message, but to no avail. The Earth woman will die anyway. They have no space equipment on board. Here, take this. It's an oxygen pill. It'll enable you to live in space. Ok, Professor. I have taken my oxygen pills. Gonna bring Venus and the Subterrane on board. Take it easy, Steve. Ok Steve, they've ejected. Roger, Professor. Prepare interceptor missile for launch. Message understood. Ignition and go. Well done, Professor. Now, winch us in. Well Venus, there's Earth. It sure looks better from here than inside that Subterrane rocket. Thanks to you, Steve. I guess I know now why they call you "The greatest astronaut on Space Patrol". I think you're cute too. Space Patrol, this is Firebal XL5 returning to base. Mission complete. Over and out. Translation - Rick Grago from sunny Delray Beach, FL I wish I was a space man The fastest guy alive I'd fly you 'round the universe In Fireball XL5 Way out in space to-gether Conquerors of the sky... My heart would be a Fireball A Fireball... Every time I gaze into your starry eyes We'd take a path to Jupiter And maybe very soon We'd cruise along the Milky Way And land upon the moon While on the land of stardust We'll zoom our way to Mars My heart would be a Fireball A Fireball... Cuz you would be my Venus of the stars
