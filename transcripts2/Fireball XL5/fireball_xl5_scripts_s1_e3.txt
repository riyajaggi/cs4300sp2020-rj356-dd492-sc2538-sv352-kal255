 Look Volvo. Countless millions of tons of Platinum. And yet on earth it is a rare and precious metal. If only I can reach Earth safely for the trade talks. All our worries will be over. And in return, Your Highness, they will give us other minerals that we so desperately need. Right. Then the people of Platonia will be happy. And my enemy Ginerva will lose his chance of seizing power. It will be your job, Volvo, to protect me.

 until the Earth men arrive to take me to their planet. I have taken all... necessary precautions, Your Highness. Thank you Volvo. You may go. Ah...It is good to have someone I can trust. Four assassination attempts in five weeks. Somebody means business, Steve. You can say that again. We've just received a message on the Neutroni transmitter, that there has been another attempt on Bizann's life. Luckily, he has survived. I don't get it. I thought you

 said that this Bizann was a good guy. Oh, he's on the level alright. He wants to trade with Earth. His rival, Ginerva, wants to conquer him. So Fireball has been chosen to bring Bizann to Earth safely for the trade talks, huh? Right. Now Steve, you know how important your mission is. If he arrives safely, it means trade. If anything goes wrong, it means war. Space City to Fireball XL5. Zero minus 40. Fireball to Space City. Roger. Stand by for blast away. 30 seconds. All systems go, Go, GO. Roger. All systems here are go. Full power. Lift off, A-Ok! What do you know about Platonia, Matt? Not much, Steve, but eh, Bizann has a strong rival in Ginerva. Guess we're heading for trouble. Does the repair of the banqueting hall please Your Highness? Yes, Volvo. If Ginerva could disgrace or kill me, he would seize power immediately and declare war on Earth. Why do you not arrest him? You cannot arrest a man you can't find. Ginerva is as elusive as a snake. You eh .. need some refresher fluid, Your Highness. Yes, Volvo. That is a good suggestion. Ahhh...I am very weary. Ahh ... A banquet! That's what we need. We will entertain the Earth spacemen when they arrive. First drink you refresher fluid, Your Highness. You drink it Volvo. The thought of the banquet has refreshed me enough. It's probably poisoned, anyway. But..eh ... I could not It is very valuable. Go on, drink it. You are a good and faithful servant. You deserve it. But ... Your Majesty ... Your hesitation makes me think that it has been poisoned. Impossible, Your Highness. I prepared it myself. Your ...health, Your Majesty. Your health, Volvo. For a moment I was beginning to be suspicious. Our friends from Earth should be arriving soon. A-ha! The refresher fluid was good? Yes, Your Highness. Now I will see to the banquet. Well, at least Volvo is faithful. The G-meter is giving a reading, Professor. Yes Steve. We are nearing Platonia. Yeah, I can see the planet clearly now. Ok Matt. Going into orbit. Fire main retros, Robert. Roger. Firing retros. All right, Steve. Fireball Jr. clear to go Ok Matt. We'll keep in radio contact. Go to greet our visitors, Volvo. Very well, Your Highness. Stand guard Robert. Don't let anyone enter Fireball Jr. Roger. Stand guard. Welcome to Platonia. Bizann awaits you. Stand guard. Stand guard. Colonel Zodiac and Dr. Venus, You will remain as my guests tonight. I have prepared a wonderful banquet in your honor. This Platonian food sure looks appetizing. Some meal, Your Highness. I'm pleased you enjoyed it. Now, the for seventh course ... Seventh course? This is real planet hospitality. Here we go again. Gee, that meal's just about fixed me. I'm all in. As your Dr. of space medicine, Steve, I diagnose your trouble as a simple case of overeating. Guess you're right. Say, Your Highness, if you'll excuse me, I'd Like to go to my room. I'm pretty tired. Certainly, Coronel Zodiac. Volvo, show our guests to their rooms. This way, my friend. That is your room, Dr. Venus. Yours, Colonel Zodiac is down the corridor, next to mine. Goodnight Volvo. Goodnight Steve. Goodnight Venus. I hope you have a good night's rest, Colonel Zodiac. Do not worry about your spaceship. I'm sure your robot will guard it well. - Sure. Good night. - Good night. Pleasant dreams, Colonel Zodiac. Zodiac to Fireball XL5. - Come in, Professor. - How are things Steve? Will you be on Platonia overnight? Guess so, Matt. I'll be glad to get back to Fireball. Don't worry, Steve. You eh.. you just get some sleep. Okay, Matt, but I'll be a real tooty if anything happen's to Robert or Fireball Jr. Relax, Steve. I eh... I'll see you tomorrow. Ok Matt. Bye. Matt, are you awake? There's something wrong. I just know there is. Matt, I'm going out to Fireball Jr. I ... I'll be standing by, Steve. Robert! What's happened to Robert? Stop or I'll fire! It's Volvo. I get it. He's been jamming Robert's controls Volvo jammed your controls, but you're OK now, Robert. Continue to guard Fireball Jr. Roger. Guard Fireball Jr. Bring him round, Venus. while I check Fireball Jr. Roger Steve. The anti-coma serum will put him right. He should be OK in half an hour. Right. Meanwhile I'm gonna search Fireball Jr. My guess is he's planted a bomb. I'm sure there's a bomb somewhere aboard, Where could they hide it? I've searched everywhere. There are a thousand places it could be hidden, but where? Well, no luck. Maybe we can force the truth out of Volvo. He refuses to speak, Steve. That's what I was afraid of. We're due to take off soon. There's only one answer.. Volvo will come with us. If there is a bomb aboard, he'll soon will tell us where it is, if he's in danger too. Ready to connect, Steve. Contact established. Magnetic locks on, Steve. "SPACE JAIL" We're on our way to Earth, Volvo. Now, where's the bomb? There is a bomb, isn't there? Find out Earth man. I will tell you nothing. Hi Steve. His Highness is enjoying the trip. Yes, Coronel Zodiac. Your Fireball is very impressive. Well, let's hope it stays that way. I'll take some food to Volvo, Steve. Have you found the bomb yet, Colonel Zodiac? Now don't worry. We're not even 100% sure there is one. Hmmm ... I see Steve's added ... a..eh.. new attachment to Robert. I must remember to ask him what it's for. Say, where is Venus? Is she with you, Matt? Well no Steve. I haven't seen her. Guess I'd better take a look. - Venus! (muffled) - Steve! Goodbye, Steve Zodiac. Too late! He's ejected. Steve, come to navigation bay at once. Emergency! A space fighter is leaving Platonia and he's on our course. My guess is it's gonna pick up Volvo. Of course. Anyone who ejected into space without organizing a pickup would be a tooty. Well, he can stay out there until we've taken care of that space fighter. OK, Professor. We're on course. Maximum speed. All right, Steve. I'm switching to radar telescope. The radar telescope, Venus. - Radar telescope operating. - I've got it. Range 24-25. Roger, Professor. Prepare forward interceptors. Roger. In range now, Steve. - Stand by with interceptor. - Standing by. Range 2400. G-rate 2. 2400. G-rate 2. Master guidance system - UHF. Master guidance system - UHF. - Ten seconds. - Ten seconds, Steve. Roger. Standing by to correct course. Six seconds to go. Five, four, three, two, one, zero and go. A-OK, Matt. Good shooting! Now, to pick up Volvo. We are approaching Volvo. Firing retro-rockets. Roger, Matt. Ready to eject. Are you all right, Steve? Sure, Matt. Contact established. Winch us in. Roger. Winch system go. Coming aboard Fireball now. Why did Gineva not pick me up? You mean he was in that fighter we destroyed? Destroyed? Then our cause is at an end. Gineva is finished. So will we be if you don't tell me where you put that bomb. You're right, Steve Zodiac. The bomb is due to go off in half an hour from now. But I refuse to tell you where it is. If that bomb explodes, you will die too. - Okay, Volvo. Let's see how tough you really are. - Let's sit it out and wait. - You have five minutes to live, Volvo. I don't ... I don't want to die. I don't want to die. The bomb... It's in the robot. I can see it ...and we've only got two and a half minutes. Hurry, Steve. There's only 90 seconds to go. Careful... The slightest movement could set it off now. Get the ejection tube open, Matt. 60 seconds. Ejection tube open, Steve. Thirty seconds, Steve. Be careful. (over intercom) 17 seconds. 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Phew...Sure was close. Ginerva is no more. Now my people will be at peace. I sure hope so, Your Highness. Don't worry about Volvo. He won't give any more trouble on this flight. I've given him some knockout drugs. And I have Steve Zodiac and his wonderful crew to thank for everything. Ok, Robert. Let's head for Earth. Fireball XL5 to Space City. Put down the red carpet. We're on our way. Over and out. Translation - Rick Grago in sunny Delray Beach, FL I wish I was a space man The fastest guy alive I'd fly you 'round the universe In Fireball XL5 Way out in space to-gether Conquerors of the sky... My heart would be a Fireball A Fireball... Every time I gaze into your starry eyes We'd take a path to Jupiter And maybe very soon We'd cruise along the Milky Way And land upon the moon While on the land of stardust We'll zoom our way to Mars My heart would be a Fireball A Fireball...
