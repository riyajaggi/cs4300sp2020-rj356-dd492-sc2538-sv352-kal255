 ♪ Let me work my magic ♪ ♪ Watch me backflip ♪ ♪ Watch me backflip ♪ ♪ Let me work my magic ♪ Seventeen hundred, matey. And worth every bruckle. Could it be true? Was it all just a scam? The Chickeraffe sold by our beloved Sam? Sam, you can't. Take good care of it. So, what you gonna do with all the cash? Gold-plated stone? I've got a good stone man. Nah, I'm just taking the next cold air balloon to AnyOldWhereButHere. Ah! You and your partner getting out of town to lay low? Guy? No, he was just a patsy. A real smuntz. Certainly, not my best friend. - What about the woman? - Double patsy. And her daughter? - Triple patsy. - Oh! I like your style. Can't have friends in our business. You... are... beautiful. One last thing: does it have a name? No. I didn't want to get attached. Now let's chain you to a wall for the rest of your life. Guy had given up. An inventor he ain't. He's just some poor smuntz who sits watching paint. Keep watching. Uh, yes, sir. Do not, under any circumstances, leave that chair until the paint is fully dry. Or you're fired! Understood? Uh, yes, Mr... Up-up-up! ...resulting in a precise tabulation of 70,017. - Huh? - Thank you. Michellee's beans counted, she could finally move on. Oh, glad that's over. Now we can have some fun. E.B.? Until she realized her daughter was gone! Oh! Oh, my! E.B.? Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. E.B.? E.B.! Would you hurry it up? Yes, Mr. Snerz. Hurry it up! Hurry it up! Come on. Come on. Hurry it up! - Move! - Moving! Yes Man, what's taking so long? There, finished. - ...do everything myself? - Very nearly there, sir! I got it! Diabolical shackle! When the Cronies see you, they are going to hate themselves and rethink their entire lives! Oh! Oh, Cronies! Are you ready to be humiliated? All right, Mr. Jenkins. I'm busting you outta here. Oh! Easy. Oh! Huh? What the... Suck in your cheeks. What's... Relax! Oh! Mr. Jenkins, stop! It's me, E.B.! E.B.? Where are you, honey? Oh, you poor creatures. - Mom? - E.B.? Funny story. What is Mr. Jenkins doing up there?! Oh! It was you! You did this! What? No. This is the last, last straw. The camel's back is broken. - But I'm sure you're fine with that... - No! ...because clearly you have no problem hurting animals. I have been lied to, manipulated... Don't worry. Mom'll help you, Mr. Jenkins. - ...and I've had enough! - Guess you're just scared. That's weird! Chickeraffes like ties, not... Whoa! Beans. As we celebrate another year at SnerzCo, we remember those employees who are no longer with us. ♪ What the world needs now... ♪ ♪ Is love, sweet love ♪ ♪ It's the only thing... ♪ What? ♪ That there's just too little of... ♪ Huh? Wait! That's me. No, no, no! Hello, Cronies! Enjoying yourselves? - No. - Wonderful! And when you see what I'm about to show you, you're gonna feel even worse. - Come on. Follow me. - Huh? Mom! Guy! I have something to tell you! I have to get all these animals out of here. Let me help. - You've done more than enough. - Mom! And just for the record, I never liked you. - I just felt sorry for you. - Guy! Yeah, well, I feel sorry for you now, because you're making a huge mistake. Hey! Listen! This is not Mr. Jenkins. It's not even a Chickeraffe. It's a Girooster! If that's a Girooster, then... Sam did the right thing. And so did Guy. You don't really hate him, do you, Mom? Tell him how you feel. This way, lessers! Commence feeling inferior! Thieves! How dare you steal my stolen Chickeraffe? Yes Man! Yes, Mr. Snerz. - Get that animal! - Yes, sir! - This does not look good. - Let's go! - Stop them at once! - Freeze! It's the BADGUYS, McWinkle and Gluntz! Who the Yip are you? We're the BADGUYS. Bureau of Animal Defense, Glurfsburg Upper Yipville Section. And you are all under arrest. For endangering an endangered animal, transporting an endangered animal, necktie theft... You don't need to read every charge. You're right. I can sing them! ♪ Resisting arrest ♪ ♪ Insider trading ♪ ♪ Outsider trading ♪ ♪ Prematurely aging An officer of the law ♪ Mom, spill the beans. What? I don't know. Before she stops singing! ♪ Walking with a suspended license ♪ I... do like you... a lot. - I meant spill the beans. - Oh! Oh, I thought you were using it as an expression. Oh, great! - Yeah. Now I said that, I don't even... - I'm glad you did. ♪ Goat identity theft ♪ ♪ And impersonating a... ♪ ♪ Carnival worker ♪ Now cuff 'em! Huh? - It's working! - Oh! Yeah! - Capture that Chickeraffe! - Yes, Mr. Snerz. Come on! Gotcha! Come back here, Chickeraffe! Huh? We have to catch Sam before he gets on that balloon. Hey! Where do you think you're going? I have a best friend to find. And a pet, too! Welcome to Meepville Balloon Port. To safely exit the tram, please hold hands with your best friend in the whole wide world. Your three first-basket tickets to Chickeraffe Island will be exactly 1,700 bruckles, please. One for a Mr. Sam-I-Am, one for a mysterious briefcase, and one for a Mr. Travel Buddy, Guy-Am-I. Huh, I guess I won't be needing that last one. Oh, sorry. No refunds. Your balloon departs from platform 71. Oh! And your in-float film will be Two Best Buds Who Can Never Be Broken Up. Oh, that's my favorite movie! Next. Got ya! You're mine! You belong to... Oh! It's the stolen Chickeraffe! Why, those are all endangered species! As a stockholder, I demand answers! Uh, as do I! Whose animals are these? Close the curtain! You were right about this Gala, Snerzy. It is wonderful! Yes! Thank you so much for the invite, old bean! Hmm? Hmm? Oh! I've been bamboozled by a bamboozler! And he's getting on a balloonzler! To the cold airport! You're almost home, pal. The float back to your fam leaves in five. What'll it be there, buddy? Hmm, tough call. But I'm gonna go with the green eggs and ham. Oh! There he is! Sam! Is Mr. Jenkins... Heading home. I would never let anything bad happen to him. But someone didn't believe me. Sam, I am so sorry. You are my friend, and I should have believed you. Mm-hmm. E.B., why don't we get you a flannel candy? Um.. Uh, but... The truth is you're the best friend I've ever had. I'm the only friend you've ever had. Yes, but that still makes you the best. You know, the only thing that's ever hurt as much as missing my mom was what you said about her leaving me. I know. But is there any way you could at least try to forgive me? I don't know. It's not easy to warm up a friendship gone cold. It takes something big, something huge, something bold. Guy, what are you doing? This is how much I want to be your friend. Guy! You don't have to do this. I do. I'm not sure they're gonna be good here, Sam, but I'm gonna try. Wait! Guy, don't be insane! Green eggs and ham are good anywhere. Ugh! Mmm! Say! I like green eggs and ham. I do! I like them, Sam-I-Am. And I would eat them on a boat, and I would eat them with a goat, and I will eat them in the rain, and in the dark, and on a train! And I will eat them in a box, and I will eat them with a fox! Michael... And I will eat them in a house, and I will eat them with a mouse! And in a car, and in a tree, and I will eat them here and there. Say! I will eat them anywhere! Hold that thought. I really like where you're going with this, don't get me wrong, but, uh, yeah... Flee! That's my Chickeraffe! Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're gonna need to check those. Okay. Ooh! Oh, that's still good. Nope. Sorry, sir. You will need to remove that Flerz. What?! What Flerz? Dillikins! Which way now? Hmm, let's see. Our float leaves from platform 71. Whoa. But how do we get all the way up there? Simple. We just gotta hop on that Balloon-a-Vator. Going down. Hold the door. Just give me a second. Uh, it'll be here soon. Not soon enough. Yes! That's how we defend animals, son! And I'll take that Chickeraffe. It's over, Sam. Good job, Mr. J. Hmph. New plan. Follow me. I am loving this new side of you. So, Guy, what's the... Whoa! Wait for it. Jump! Here we go. Whoa! Got you. Whoa! Pull me up! Pull me up! Pull me up! Thanks, buddy. Whoo! Whoa! Do you think they'll make it? Not without our help. - Genuine Friendship! - Hold on! Whoo! I'll find you! Whoo! - Oh! - Best business trip ever! We're almost there. - Whoa! - Whoa! Platform 71. We made it! That's my Chickeraffe! - Mr. Snerz! - Oh! Oh! Save yourself! Jump onto that ledge! Never! I'm not going anywhere without that Chickeraffe! I know it's hard to let go of something you love. But sometimes you have to do it, even when it's scary. You can do this. I know it. You can let go. Nope! Gimme that! He's mine! Give me... - Huh? - This is for your own safety. Genuine Friendship! No! Free me at once! Get me out of this! Do you have any idea who I am? Why, it's Hervnick Z. Snerz! - And he wears a Flerz! - Mr. Snerz, over here! - Mr. Snerz! - Does the Flerz have a name? Mr. Snerz! What's your opinion on the Flerz? Over here. Care to comment on the Flerz? We're going back up! Whoo! Ho! We did it! Start the balloon! Stop that balloon! - That animal... - Animal... - ...belongs... - Belongs... - ...in a zoo. - Zoo. You can take me in, but let the Chickeraffe go. I've done a lot of scams. I mean, a lot. But this last one was for a good reason: to get Mr. Jenkins home. Please. It's my one last job. Well, Sam-I-Am... I've got three words for you. Start... the... balloon. Did you hear that, Mr. Jenkins? But your perfect record, sir. You always get your target. Well, there's a first time for everything. This was a great first job, sir. Permission to give you one first/last high five? Permission denied. Agent Gluntz. It fits! Well, big fella. This is the end of the road. You mean, you're not going with him? Mr. Jenkins belongs with his mom. And there's still a chance I could find mine. So I'm going to stay here and keep eating green eggs and ham until I find hers. I got to keep trying. But... I'm gonna miss the big fella. Real bad. I love you, Mr. Jenkins. Aww. And we always will. Time for take-off! - Take care, Mr. Jenkins! - Bye! Goodbye, buddy! Bye, Mr. Jenkins! I'll never forget you! What was that for? The Goat is on the balloon. I'm on the balloon. He's on the balloon. Mom, we have to do something! It's too high. There's nothing we can do. Yes, there is. No, Guy! It's too high! What if it explodes? Oh, it might, but I have to try. That was beautiful. Huh? Let's dance. Whoa! Well, well... looks like that flying machine of yours didn't work, compadre. Guess we'll find out, amigo. Whoa! It's okay, Mr. Jenkins. Everything's going to be okay. Nice try, but you've only made me stronger. Prepare to... I built that. Guy-Am-I, you are a reckless, dangerous man. And I love it. Oh! I love you, too. Goodbye, Mr. Jenkins! Say hi to your mom! Safe journey, old buddy. Okay, boys. What can I get ya? Hmm. Tough call. Let me see. Lots of choices here. What's it gonna be? Purple pancakes... That sounds lovely. Do you have any specials? Two orders of green eggs and ham, please. I like them. A conclusion I would've eventually come to on my own. Mm-hmm. Thank you for getting me to try them, okay? Thank you, Sam-I-Am. This was the story of Sam and of Guy, a story about giving new things a try. Like green eggs and ham, or love, or a friend. And now it's all over. Sorry. The end. Or is it? Mmm. Mmm! What's going on, Sam? The eggs... they're my... mom's! Oh. You all right there, buddy? Sorry. He... He just... He really liked your recipe. Oh, yeah. It's the eggs. I have 'em shipped in. Nice little farm in East Flubria. That must be where my mother is! Uh, East Flubria? That's halfway around the world. That's why we should get going! ♪ Hey, guitar player ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ New York's number-one cut creator ♪ ♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh ♪ ♪ Hey, speed skater ♪ ♪ T-t-t-t-take a right ♪ ♪ Let's put an ad in the papers ♪ ♪ Uh ♪ ♪ Backflip ♪ ♪ You know what to do ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Backflip ♪ ♪ You know what to do ♪ ♪ Ooh, let your freak flag fly ♪ ♪ Watch me backflip ♪ ♪ Watch me backflip ♪ ♪ Let me work my magic ♪ ♪ Let me work my magic ♪ ♪ Watch me backflip ♪ ♪ Watch me backflip ♪ ♪ Let me work my magic ♪
