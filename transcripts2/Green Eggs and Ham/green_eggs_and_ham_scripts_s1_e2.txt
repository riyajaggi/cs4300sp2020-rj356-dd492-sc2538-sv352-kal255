And burnt his briefcase at the end of his rope. Then a noise, and he grabbed it. -There was something inside! -[whimpering] [narrator] A wild, scary beast! And nowhere to hide! This is it. I'm done for. I've lived my last day! [narrator] Oh, don't be dramatic. -[squawks] -[narrator] It just wants to play! [warbling] [warbling continues] [squawking] Ugh!

No. [squawks] [warbles] [laughs] -[warbles] -Oh. Oh! No, no, no, no! Oh! [squawking] Why are there so many vases? [Chickeraffe laughs] [squawks] [warbling] [squawks] [clucking] ♪ Still going to Meepville! ♪ ♪ Still going to Meepville! ♪ All right, buddy. Take it easy. I just wanna get you back in your briefcase where you'll-- -[knocking on door] -[gasps] -[man] Hello? Mr. Am-I? -[toots horn] Ugh. Oh, no. -[warbles] -Stay! -[knocking on door] -Please, stay! -[man] Hello? -[knocking on door] [sniffles] Mr. Am-I? Is everything all right? [warbles] [squeals] Thank you! We're fine! The room is neither on fire nor under water. Excellent, sir. We hope you're enjoying your executive suite featuring 17 rare and priceless vases. Are those, by any chance, insured? [laughing] No! They're rare and priceless! Anyhoo, as a Quintuple Stainless Member, you are now entitled to a complimentary lullaby! So, if you'll just snuzzle yourself into bed and allow me to tuck you in... If you don't mind... -[Chickeraffe laughs] -[items clatter] I sleep better standing up. Of course, sir.

Ooh! Junk mail! Sweet! Ho! Back flip! Whoa! All right, big fella, welcome to my place. It's just me here... until now! Let me show you around. Here's... pretty much everything, but don't get too comfortable, because the two of us are hittin' the road! [narrator] Sam thought his search for a buddy was about to end, because inside that case would be his new friend. Now, who's ready for the first of many hugs? What the-- Oh! Huh? Oh! Where's the Chickeraffe?! [Snerz] Where is the Chickeraffe? Delay? What delay? No! I told you the animal must be here in Meepville by SnerzDay! Today is Vingsday. Vingsday, Vongsday, Bangsday, Wingsday, Longsday, SnerzDay! [orchestra plays angry music] Yes, I know I have a lot of other animals. I have the most impressive collection of rare and exotic creatures in the entire northeastern quadri-sphere. -Thank you very much! -[animals sigh] But compared to a Chickeraffe, these guys are all just a bunch of losers! [animals growl] Yes, you are! [snaps fingers] So, by sunrise on SnerzDay, there's going to be a new head on the wall, either the Chickeraffe's or yours! Can you dig it? [inhales deeply] -[grunts] -[all inhale deeply] [orchestra plays dramatic music] [high-pitched scream] [music ends] [bell on door rings] Well, I'm not gonna sugar-coat it. The Bigman sends his love! He said he appreciates our efforts and believes in us forever! Also he asks that I compliment you on your hat specifically. Gluntz, that was so sugar-coated, I'm gettin' a cavity. Hey there, big guy. What can I get you? One Last Job Special to go. You got it, dear. Wait! Last Job Special? You mean-- Yes, I'm retiring from the BADGUY game, Gluntz. -And my one last job is almost over. -[food sizzling] What did the guard at the zoo tell us he found outside the Chickeraffe cage? Oh! A kite, a snorkel, and a pole vault pole! It was some of your finest intimidating! Only one place in Glurfsburg sells all those items. Lem's House of Kites, Snorkels, and Pole Vault Poles. [Gluntz] Oh, poor Lem! Looks like the kite, snorkel, pole vault pole bubble has finally burst. Hard to believe. Only one customer this year, and his address... -is on this receipt. -[bell dings] One last job, Gluntz. Let's go get our target. -Destination: eight, three-- -Eight, three, five-- Are you writing? 8351 North Bluff Gluff. -[Donna on phone] North, not South! -Yes. -And you're sure that's where he lives? -[Chickeraffe squawking] The little man who ordered the green eggs and ham? [Donna gasps] Oh, yes! Sam! That's right! You guys are Briefcase Buddies! No! We are not Briefcase Buddies! -[squawks] -[grunting] -[Chickeraffe laughs] -[grunting] -[squawks] -[groans] -[laughs] -[groans] -[warbles] -Ugh! [warbling] [squawking] [narrator] Our grumpy friend Guy huffed and puffed up the gluff to tell Sam-I-Am that he'd had quite enough. Sadly, Guy cannot hear me when I tell him, "Beware! Because the BADGUYS, in fact, are already there!" Hmph! [grumbles] [groans] [grumbles] -Going somewhere? -[gasps] Um, not at all. I mean, not here at least. Why do you ask? Why do we ask? I don't know. Why do you ask? We're looking for something. Is this your house? This place? No! Why are you at this house if it's not your house? Mmm, technically, I think it's more of a vehicle. How would you know that if it's not your house? Gotcha question! Woop, woop! You're killin' this, Winks! I'm aware. Now, if what's in the briefcase is what we think it is, then you're in a lot of trouble. -Briefcase? [chuckling] What briefcase? -[Chickeraffe squawks] Oh, oh! This briefcase! -Nothing! Nothing's in here! -[squawking] This briefcase is just an unremarkable attache sold in most major stores. By attache, of course, I mean briefcase. You certainly seem to be saying briefcase a lot. Briefcase? I mean, am I? I-I don't think so. Not anymore than I usually say briefcase, which is very rarely. Anyway, I'm sorry I can't help you with your case, but I'm sure it'll be brief. A real brief case! [chuckles nervously] [McWinkle and Gluntz chuckle] Okay, look, this thing isn't even mine. I took it by mistake. Gluntz, net me. [chuckles] Just stay still. This won't hurt at all. Who are you people? We're the BADGUYS! Yes! I've always wanted to say that! Oh, I'm gonna have so much to journal about tonight! -[vehicle approaches] -[all gasp] [all scream] [horn honks] Hey, hop on in! [Gluntz and McWinkle grunt] Come on! Let's skedaddle! [McWinkle grunting] -[Guy] Go, go! -[engine revs] [tires squeal] [McWinkle groans] He's got my car. Oh, my gosh! A fleer! We've got a fleer! [growls] Oh, that's right. This was supposed to be your one last job. You were ready to pack it up, but oh, boy, that is not happening today! Not yet! Not today! Uh, but, uh... -[all] Aww. -[McWinkle growls] [narrator] Sam-I-Am had ruined McWinkle's big day. He'd worked his last nerve... [growls] [narrator] ...and turned his fur grey. What? Oh, nothing. [upbeat music plays] [tires squeal] -Whoo! Isn't fleeing fun? -[Guy grunting] [Sam] Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, that was a close call, huh? But you are safe and sound right here in this car with me. Yup! One 100% secure! What's going on? Who are those maniacs? Oh, they're the BADGUYS. Thought they made that pretty clear. [tires squeal] -Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't open that! -[squawks] [tires squeal] Whoa! Oh, you let it out! It? This Chickeraffe has a name, you know. I just haven't decided on one yet. So far I've been calling him Big Fella. But I'm also considering Chickpea or Guy Jr. Just spitballing. Although, Guy Jr. is the clear front-runner at the moment. I don't care. Would you please stop licking me? [coughing] Ugh, great work, Guy. You gave him a furball. [Chickeraffe clucking] No, no! People will see it! [Sam] It's fine. [coughing] [Sam] Look at him! He loves it! [warbles] Oh, Guy Jr. loves hanging his head out the window! [squawks] [groaning] Everyone's after this beast! Oh! If anyone sees it, we're gonna be in a whole lot of trouble! Trouble? Relax! I am a licensed Wildlife Rescuer! Those BADGUYS wanna sell the poor fella to a collector, whereas I have his best interests in mind. Your mother must be proud. Now, let me out. Pssh, come on. Where're you headed? [squawks] [groans] Meepville. [gasps] Get out! I'm headed to the Big Meep, too! That's where I'm taking Guy Jr.! So, what're you gonna do in the MVL, travel buddy? [grumbles] I'm headed to Meepville to be a Paint Watcher. Whoa! Watching paint dry? Fun! Fun, fun. Fun, fun, fun. It's not "fun". It's a solid, practical, fall-back profession. [Sam] Uh-huh. Very solid! Not giving up on your dream at all. Just... let me out right here! [Sam] Hey. I'm sorry if I wasn't super psyched about your new job, travel bud. You just struck me as the kind of guy who's destined for great things! Well, I hate to disappoint you, Sam-I-Am, but I'm just not that kind of guy. Okay, well, -you wanna exchange contact info? -Nope. Then how about a hug goodbye? For the Chickeraffe. Huh-uh. Got it. Not a hugger. I respect that. Then how about a nice handshake and some firm plans to meet up in Meepville, -just as soon as you get there. -No! [sentimental music plays] [Chickeraffe squawks sadly] ["Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" plays] ♪ Mrs. Brown You've got a lovely daughter... ♪ [grunting] Honey, don't jostle. When the seatbelt feels like it's digging into your skin, that's how you know it's working. [sighs] Oh, I can't believe I forgot the safety poofs! [shouts] [muffled] Mom, it's smooshing my face. There. Can you move? [grunts] -No! -Great! -[horn honking] -Huh? [tires squeal] [man laughing] [child] Hit it over here! -Yes! -Yay! -[man] Hey, nice shot! -Score! [laughing] -[woman] Oh, gosh! -[man] Whoa! Wicked match, kid! [horn honks melody] [groans] [sighs] ♪ Mrs. Brown You've got a lovely daughter... ♪ Meepville is gonna be super fun. I promise. It's a business trip, Mom. You're only going to present your beans at the Snerz thing. Oh, no! It's not just a thing! It's the SnerzDay Gala... thing. [sighs] Plus, just imagine all the amazing sights there are to see in the big city. Yeah! That's right! I heard they have a toy store there that's so big, it has a roller coaster inside! -Do you think we can go see that? -You bet we can! There's a great view from the SnerzCo Corporate Conference Room! Fully panoramic, extremely clean windows. Trust me, you'll be able to see all the coolest things from a safe distance. [groans] [pants] [sighs] Huh? Oh! I'm saved! Hello! Please stop! Please? [snoring] Mom, look! Look! I think that guy needs help! Help! Please! I need so much help! Come on. Oh, thank goodness. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm stranded out here, and there's no one to help me, and I really need a ride to Meep-- [narrator] When Guy saw Michellee, his face felt like fire. She'd witnessed him wreck his beloved Self-Flyer. -Mom, slow down! -Absolutely not! You never pick up hitchhikers on the side of the road, E.B, or anywhere else for that matter. [grunts] But Mom, look at him. The poor guy's stranded. I will not look at him because taking my eyes off the road would make a dangerous situation even more dangerous, plus the tenor of his voice clearly indicates that he's a deranged lunatic. -I'm not. -[Michellee] Or a drifter hoping to make us pawns in his treacherous ruse. Also not. And have you even considered the possibility that he's a felon? I'm sorry, but if you're passing on the whole giving me a ride thing, you mind finishing this out of my ear shot? Your judgments are very hurtful. You're right! That was insensitive of me. Anyway, good luck with the rest of your travel, Mr. Lunatic! -Mom, wait! -Buckle up your headbelt, sweetie. I'm kickin' it into overdrive! [E.B.] Mom, stop! [tires squeal] [Guy coughing] [sighs] ["Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing" playing] [Guy] Chickeraffe... Green eggs... Annoying little man... Annoying! [grumbles] [narrator] Guy started to think he'd made the wrong choice. Huh?! Hey, who said that? What is that voice? [narrator] I'm your narrator, Guy.

You look frightened, Guy! You look weak! You look... Hungry. [squawks] [laughs] -[grumbles] -[Sam] Oh, hey there! Guess I must've made a wrong turn and ended up right back where you were. Weird. [chuckles] Good thing I happened to grab some extra food and Bevvies, which I will just leave on the off chance you could use a little pick-me-up on your long, lonely journey to the ville. Ah! [gulping] [gasps] [spits] Ick! What is this? -Hot chocolate? -Oh. That is my bad right there. See, I ordered a steaming hot chocolate for myself, and a frosty, cold, iced chocolate for you. [sips] ["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" plays] -[grumbles] -[slurps] Ah! Oh, the hot chocolate feels great! You know, considering how chilly and cool it gets riding around in this heavily air-conditioned car all day. [blows] [blows] [Sam] So... travel buddies again?
