They have come from all over the country. From Orange County, California. Boston, Massachusetts. New Orleans, Louisiana. And even from beyond its borders. I come from Mexico. If I make it past immigration, I think I can make it past chef Ramsay. Oh, dear. They may be the most confident chefs ever. But I'm about to bust it out in the kitchen. I'm gonna explode. I'm here to bring it! I got nothing to lose and I got everything to prove. He's not shy. I love it. I'm chef Jessica. I will out-work every single one of you up there right now. Wow! I don't think any of them are competition for me. I could go up against any of those guys. After listening to all of you, I am scared . Now... Working with me this year, overseeing the ladies' team, chef Andi. And, overseeing the men's team, new to Hell's Kitchen this year, chef James. Okay, I'd like everybody to listen very carefully. One of you will become my head chef at the brand-new Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill right here at the legendary Caesar's Palace! What? Working with chef Ramsay in Vegas, that is the dream job. My whole life's work is coming together right now. This is my time. This amazing position comes with a salary of $250,000. Yeah! Whoo! Now... I have a big announcement. For the first time ever in the history of Hell's Kitchen, the signature dish challenge will happen in front of a live audience. The competition to become my head chef begins right now. Oh, . Chef Ramsay has flown 20 aspiring chefs to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas to make one huge announcement... One of you will become my head chef at the brand-new Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. After another.

All of you have got 45 minutes to come up with something stunning that really represents you on a plate. Don't screw up. And, as they say in Vegas, good luck. Let's go! I wasn't expecting to be cooking today. I'm wearing a dress and a nice pair of wedgies. Oh, hell no. Get it done, get it done. Right here, buddy. Yo, where's the food processor at? Behind you. I hope the food is as good as the energy. Let's go. Once again, chef Ramsay has divided the teams into men and women. Does anybody need an egg wash? I'll take that. There you go. You got a buyer. I'm from Queens. I run a kitchen very efficiently. But never in an environment anything like this. I'm trying not to burn people. I'm trying not to get burned by people. 30 minutes to go. God. Right behind, coming through. I'm from L.A. My signature dish will be a stuffed steak. I love meat, cheese, and onion. Why not put 'em together? Five minutes! Let's go. I'm just wrapping up my dish. My lamb ain't cooked yet. I don't got no garnishes ready. All I know is I'm running out of time. Two minutes to go! Let's go, come on. Right behind you. Coming down. Move, move. Let's go, let's go! Let's go there, guys. Come on, guys. Five...Four... Three... Two...One, and stop! With their dishes complete, it's now time for the chefs to face chef Ramsay... Ladies and gentlemen, you ready? I am. And an audience of 2,500 people. Okay... Let's start. First up, it's executive chef Danielle from Atlanta... Thank you. And head chef Barret from Long Island. Before I start tasting, could you just turn around for me, please? Is that "H. K."? Yes, chef. Is that a pitchfork? Yes, chef. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Run through the dish, please. Uh, it's a pork loin roulade with fresh spinach, pine nuts, oyster mushrooms, and shitake mushrooms... Yeah. With a roasted garlic mashed potato and shallots. About how much garlic did you put in there? Uh, I put quite a bit of garlic in. Just have a taste of the garlic in there. No wonder your hair's standing up. Not a great start. Danielle, describe the dish, please. I made a parmesan-encrusted chicken breast with grilled asparagus and a lemon buerre blanc. The asparagus looks burnt. Oh, dear. Got that color underneath. And that color on top. What happens in Vegas should stay Vegas, right? And what happened in that kitchen quite honestly should have stayed in that kitchen. I'm unimpressed. Zero, zero. Not a good start. Let's go. Get rid of that. And now, kitchen manager Nedra from Detroit and sous chef Sebastian from Brooklyn. Somebody get on the ball. Let's go. Where are you going? Where are you going? I'm trying to avoid, it chef. I'm trying to avoid it. I don't wanna... Okay, Nedra, describe your dish, please. Chef, can we pray before you bust my balls? Thank you, Nedra. What did you say in the prayer? Lord, please don't let chef bust my balls. What a beautiful prayer. Okay, Nedra, describe your dish, please. I have double-grilled potatoes with a rosemary glaze on my lamb. You go girl, whoo! The good news is... It's cooked perfectly. Okay, Sebastian. These are shrimp and salmon corn dogs. Where's the shrimp? The shrimp's in there. It's made like a sausage. Would you taste that, please? Um, sure, chef. Say another prayer. What'd you think? Yeah. You got one thing right before you presented that dish. You tried to bolt out the back door. Yes, chef. I know, that's what I was thinking. Congratulations to the girls. One-nil. Great start. I got the first point today for the girls' team. Whoo ooh ooh ooh. Next up, culinary student Susan from Orange County, and lead cook Jeremy from Los Angeles. Thank you. Jeremy. Chef, I prepared a stuffed steak with smoked gouda. And your job is? I'm a lead cook, chef. And what is that, a rib eye? Yes. Well, no, it's not a rib eye, chef. What is it? I think it's a, uh... I think it's a... I think it's a rib eye. I'm sorry, chef. You think it's rib eye. It looks like a rib eye. I believe it is a rib eye, chef. So you're a lead cook, and you haven't got a clue what you're cooking? Pretty much, chef. I'm sorry. Just asking. This is your dish. When you slice into a steak of that quality, you destroy the fibers and the texture, because you're stuffing it. I'm sorry chef. Susan. Yes, chef. Now, first off... Yes, chef? How many fingers have I got up? Five. So you're not blind. Because I can see from here that your lamb is absolutely raw. This is a serious competition. It's not even warm. It's raw. Are you seriously trying to kill me? Do you want to go home right now? In the first-ever... Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready? Signature dish challenge done in front of a live audience, the women lead the men by one point. That lamb is absolutely raw. But with Susan's raw lamb, the red team could be losing more than just a point. You can off now. And what's this mess here? It's a couscous with currants and toasted pine nuts. Mm-hmm. Ptuh! Sorry. Couscous is overcooked, and the lamb's raw. Yes, chef. Is this funny for you? No points. Disgusting. Now, executive chefs Ja'nel from Houston and Ray from Boston. This is... Chef, I have for you thai grilled prawns with a spicy Asian Pesto. Just two of them? Are we on a budget? Just asking. Are we on a diet? We are not on a diet. No? So is it an appetizer or a entree, or... where are we going with this? Let's go appetizer. Appetizer. Smart. Mmm. Wow, wow, wow. The sort of sour-sweety heat that you've got in that capellini, nailed. Thank you. Good job. Really good job. Uh, Ray, tough competition. Uh, right. How old are you? 51. You are the oldest chef we've had on Hell's Kitchen, let me tell you. Uh, right. What is that? What's in there? Uh, stuffed veal cutlet with prosciutto and gruyere cheese, topped with a piece of homemade ricotta. Wow, Ray. It's cooked to perfection. Wow, wow, wow. Let me tell you something. The competition has just gone up a level. Yeah? It's a tough one. It's very tough. Um...The point... Goes to both of you. Well done. Yeah! Really well done. Next, we have line cook Gina from the Bronx and head cook Dan from Westchester, New York. Dome off, please. Thank you. Gina, describe your dish, please. It's penne pasta with homemade meatballs and a stuffed brigole with Italian sausage. Mm-hmm. Wow. Um, I've got one very important question. Did you pick this up at the buffet? No? It's bland. The penne's undercooked. I don't get it. Okay, uh... Seriously... Did you throw up on that plate? Let's go back 45 minutes. Okay. What is it supposed to be? Eggs Benedict with a champagne hollandaise sauce, sourdough bread, heirloom tomatoes, and sauteed spinach. And how did you make the hollandaise? I used whole butter. If it's good enough for Julia Childs, it's good enough for me. Julia Childs would be turning in her grave right now if she saw that. It's fitting that you made this in Vegas, because whoever eats that is sure to get the craps, let me tell you. That is a joke. Uh... Bitter disappointed. I mean, really disappointed. Uh, neither of you deserve a point. Shocking. And you should be embarrassed, young man. With the women clinging to a one-point lead... Uh, Amanda. Ladies first. Executive chef Amanda from orange county... Tasty. Thank you. Takes on chef de cuisine jon from York, Pennsylvania. You've managed to nail it. Both of you are gonna get a point. Congratulations. Well done. And it's a draw. Finally, things are looking up. Next up, head chef cyndi from queens... That's delicious. Than you, chef. Really delicious. Faces off against executive chef Michael from plains, Pennsylvania. Finesse, seasoned beautifully. Both dishes impress. Tough to decide. The edge goes to Michael. Congratulations. But only Michael gets the point, leaving the teams tied at three. It's not how you start, it's how you finish, right? Yes, chef. Let's go. Next up, chef tournant Jessica from New York City and line chef Anthony from New Orleans. Your domes off, please. Right, uh, ladies first. What is that? I made a pan-seared wahoo with a vegetable succotash and a lemon-thyme vinaigrette. And where are you working now? I work in mid-tent... midtown Manhattan at a steakhouse. Mm-hmm. So you work at a steakhouse, and you cook a wahoo for me. Yes. Right. The succotash is delicious. Uh, wahoo seasoned beautifully. Um, it's a good dish. It was lovely. It's light. Very nice. Thank you. Uh, good. Things are looking up. Now, what is that? That is a new Orleans barbecue scallop po' boy. Why would you stick all that in there just... Just as a side, so it wasn't on the plate. Make it a little neater. Let me show you something really difficult. That was difficult. Uh, right. Now, that is disgusting. The scallops are a joke. They're raw. That is hideous. And you've just embarrassed New Orleans cuisine. Congratulations, ladies. Good job. Guys, pull it back. Let's go. And now, Boston line cook Christian and Mary the butcher from Belchertown, Massachusetts. I have for you a... ah, Jesus. I have for you... That's much better. A pan-seared duck breast. With, um, a red wine and orange reduction. Wow. Uh, where you cooking? I'm a butcher at a market in Amherst, Massachusetts. And the duck is still raw in the middle. You've got that white line of fat yes, chef. Underneath. And the duck is chewy. Yes, chef. So insufficient resting, but it's not even cooked properly. I'm sorry, chef. Well, congratulations. You certainly butchered your dish. Now, what is that? It's called pasta ala Norma. A sauteed eggplant with garlic, and it's topped with... basil and shaved ricotta salata. And where did you get the majority of your line experience? I bounced around through mom and pop shops in the north end of Boston. Mm-hmm. I mean, it looks a mess, but it's got flavor, and you've got heart and passion in there. Thank you, chef. One to the men. Congratulations, well done. Thank you. Good. Uh, four to four. Final pairing. Ladies and gentlemen, you ready? Ladies and gentlemen, it's the final round, and we have a tie. Now, headline cook Zach from Philadelphia will face roundsman Jacqueline from Florence, New Jersey. Let's go. Uh...Right. Big boy. What is that? That's grilled pork chop with mustard Greens. And your position is... Uh, just line cook. Don't just dish... "a line cook is a line cook." I mean, that's where head chefs are made on the line, right? Right. Yes, chef. I mean... Combination of the apple, um, fig. The dish tastes nice. Unfortunately, the protein, yeah, is slightly dry. What about the flavor? I said it tastes nice. Thank you, chef. Thank you, chef. The question for me is... Is Jacqueline's better? 'Cause it all comes down to this. Okay, I have a roasted magret duck breast with a sweet potato roasty and caramelized brussels sprouts with a currant au jus. Seasoned beautifully. Presented nice. This is really close. Both dishes have got great execution, presentation, beautiful. Yes, thank you. Both holding finesse. We definitely finished better than we started. But this is really tough, I'm telling you. Your dishes are gonna decide who's gonna win the first challenge. Whew. This is hard. Duck could have done with two minutes more. And the pork chop could have done with two minutes less. Oh, dear. Um... The winning team... Congratulations... With the score tied in the first-ever signature dish challenge done in front of a live audience... Right. Final pairing. It all comes down to the last two dishes. This is really close. Both dishes have got great execution. Presentation beautiful. But this is really tough, I'm telling you. Oh, dear, um... The winning team... Congratulations... Ladies, great job. Yes! Wow. Just like in Vegas, Hell's Kitchen has its winners and losers. And when you win in Hell's Kitchen, let me tell you, you win big. Ladies... Tonight, you are gonna become V.I.P. guests in Vegas, starting right now. You are in for a night full of surprises at Caesar's Palace. Ohh, yeah! Men, while the ladies are gonna be treated like V.I.P.s, your evening is gonna be anything but luxury, let me tell you. You will not be flying back to Hell's Kitchen or driving in a luxury limo. You're going back in this. This school bus will take you on a long drive through Death Valley. I've been assured that the last time they checked... It should make it. One more thing... there seems to be a problem, but they haven't got it right yet, with the air conditioning. No... Uh, gentlemen, your school bus will be leaving right now. I feel like a dumbass, and I'm not looking forward to an 8 1/2-hour school bus ride. That's an oven on wheels that may or may not get us all the way back to L.A. Yay. Hot in here, man. Road trip, yeah! If anybody sings Wheels on the Bus, I will lose my mind. * Welcome, congratulations, red team. Look at that. Oh, my God. Oh...My God. It was gorgeous. It was the biggest suite I've ever been in. Check this place out. I've never been to Vegas, and it is so cool here. Even the air smelled good, like they must manufacture delicious-smelling air. There's Sushi on our table! There is a Sushi woman! Oh, my God! I see this woman laying on the table with Sushi all over her body. This is absolutely nothing that I could ever have dreamed of. To the bus! To the bus! Oh, man, I'm sorry, guys. While the women drink to victory, the men... Super hot out here. Welcome to hell, bitch. Drink to survive. Man, it's hot! You know it's hot when you consider saving your own sweat and then drinking it. This cannot happen again. Just listen, before we try to go all Rambo, "I know what the I'm doing," listen for a second there, and then we can get it done. Don't worry about what happened today. What happened today is irrelevant. Tomorrow is gonna be key, dude. You'd think that the hot seats, the temperature, you'd think those would be the worst things about this, right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Then there's Sebastian. Gordon's expectations of us are gonna be like . So we really gotta focus on trying to make our paper, do what we know how to do... It's not important, a reason to give a ... And it's just like no more egos, let's just do what we came here to do, and that's... We try to go a little bit far beyond... We just gotta remember, it's not that they don't try to help... But if one of us gets something down on one station, and he... he shows one of us, like, let's... One thing we have to understand, guys, like if you guys want to look good, like, just jump on a station and you really don't know what you're doing, don't. I wanna throw Sebastian right out the window. He just talks too much, just "blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." I think one of the reasons that they really beat the out of us today was the fact that their dishes were pretty straightforward. Pretty simple. Oh, my God! Sebastian...Time out. Let's get one thing straight. They won by a little... a little, little bit. Let's play the quiet game. See how you do on that one. It's over. It's over. We're not doing it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. One, I know we're not back in L.A., 'cause I don't see no lights. We didn't break down, did we? Think we got a flat. All of a sudden, the bus is stopping in the middle of the freeway. What is this? Are you absolutely me? Uh, hello? Whoa. I saw this in a horror movie once. Hey, it looks a little too dark out there for us to be going over here right now. Pitch black outside. I'm looking for the Wile E. Coyote to come out and attack. What the going on? Kind of don't want to get off. Should we get off? When you spend that much time with somebody, going through the desert, you never know what's gonna happen. It is called Death Valley, and if we come back with one less person, I didn't see anything. What was that? Having lost the challenge... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. The men were punished with a long, hot ride through the desert. It's nothing but sand and cactus. And although they're all eager to get to Hell's Kitchen... Yeah, let's get off this bus for a minute. They welcome the break from Sebastian and his constant chatter. Oh, man. Losing the challenge is just not something that's gonna happen again. All I'm thinking about is getting back to Hell's Kitchen and trying to prove that we could cook better than the girls can. While the men's night has reached a low point... Back in Vegas... Ladies, someone's here to see you. The women's evening is hitting a high note. It's her! Oh, my God, Celine Dion! They got us tickets to the concert. I'm like, "Okay." Tickets, tickets. How do you top this? Celine Dion in person? I can't even believe this is happening to me. So good to meet you. Hi. How are you? Oh, give me a hug! Who gets to stand in front of Celine Dion and grab her and hug her? Hi. How you doing, guys? Congratulations. You look pretty. That's amazing. Way to go, girls, right? Oh, my gosh, I touched her hand. I-I almost melted. She was just like gold. Like, I didn't even want to touch her she looked so beautiful. All right, ladies. Big smiles. Hold it right there. Ladies... I cannot believe we met Celine Dion. I cannot wait to watch her perform tonight. * It was a really overwhelming experience just to be sitting there with the events of the day, soaking in this amazing, talented singer. It's an experience that I'll never forget. One that I will never, ever, ever get a chance to have again. She's so unreal. After a thrilling night of fun... Unreal! The women depart Las Vegas seven hours after the men. Hell's Kitchen, here we come, baby! Whoo! And still arrive at Hell's Kitchen first. Welcome to Hell's Kitchen. Come follow me. I'll show you your dorms. Whoa! It is like so surreal that I'm here. I'm ready to go in. I'm ready to start cooking. Ohh... Yeah! Look at this! Look at the fire down there. Wow. Oh, this is so cool! This is so cute. This is really nice. This is absolutely amazing. We're close to really getting down and dirty in this competition. Aah! Oh! But not tonight. You all right? It's okay! Winners always get up. Oh, my God. Yeah, man. Whew! Here we go. Finally! It's late. I'm tired. But this is Hell's Kitchen. This is where I belong. And I'm ready! Hi, boys. Hi, guys. Have you guys been on the bus the entire time? Oh, yeah. Look at our picture there. Oh, my God. With Celine Dion? Yeah, man. Holy . Oh, wow. So you had enough time to go party and get V.I.P. treatment in the time that I got to ride a bus to L.A. It's not fair. Sorry, guys. Sorry, boys. I'm not sorry. I hope you continue to keep losin', because I want to win every challenge. This ain't bad at all. With both teams finally in Hell's Kitchen... Tomato relish... That's like the easiest one. Everyone is focusing on studying the menu. I'm not gonna remember any of this in the morning anyways. Except for one chef. Oh, my God, are these young girls? Who's brought along a very special friend. * Whatsa matter with you * it's-a nice-a place I'm trying to study, and there's a random chef puppet having conversations with me and my other roommates. I don't know what to do about it. Get the hell out of here. My name is Alfredo Al Dente. Bitch, who brings a puppet in Hell's Kitchen? I like-a the sausage, baby, over here. Gordon, what the hell kind of name is that ? Tonight, I say you sleep-a with the one eye open. Capisce? We gotta study. Gina, baby, they don't understand. But tomorrow, they're gonna cry. Gina, what the are you doing? You're acting like a two-year-old right now. Hey, Maria, you got the pasta ready? Nedra! Nedra! Oh, let me see who she's with? Come regulate in this room. Bitch, you better take you and that puppet and get the out of here 'fore I kick you and that puppet's ass. Oh, . This is not Sesame Street. You better watch your ps and qs, 'cause you don't know me. After an exhausting day in Vegas... Sorry, guys. Not in this one. Both teams hit the menu books. We gotta study. But Gina and her study buddy... Hey, Maria, you got the pasta ready? Ned! Back in the old-a country. Nedra! Are about to get schooled. This is not Sesame Street. You better watch your ps and qs, 'cause you don't know me. The first person to go is definitely gonna be this crazy bitch Gina. Get your together, home girl. You may be a little... Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Listen to me, you guys, I'm not cuckoo. I get along with everyone. I'm the person that makes everybody laugh all the time. These girls kind of like look up to me. Oh, my God. They love-a her. After a long day... What the ? I heard that. This is gonna be something else. And a weird night... All of the chefs are up early to get ready for the grand reopening of Hell's Kitchen. Come on, ladies! Well, almost all of them. It's the first day. Oh, my God. Every part of my body is aching. My neck, my spine. I'm not liking how I'm feeling. Did somebody put something in my orange juice? Who's holding us up? Gina! Well, where is she? I'm feeling like an idiot. But I have to do what I have to do. Good, we got Gina. Come on. Good, let's go. Yo, let's go. Go, red team! Morning, chefs. Morning, chef. Chef Ramsay has provided both teams with the very best equipment. You have these J.A. Henckels knife kits. But Gina's lost her edge. I'm not seeing things as they are. I'm just kind of like my mind's wandering, and I don't know why this is happening. You need to grab those aprons and put 'em on, okay? Let's start workin'. Behind, behind, behind. With dinner service coming up, we gotta come out swinging. 'Cause we're not taking another one to the chin like that. We ain't leaving it like Vegas. Ain't gonna leave it like Vegas. In the blue kitchen... Man, I'm getting the hang of this bitch. The men are a picture of teamwork. Raise on pasta! Raise on pasta! I've got some half lemons here. But in the red kitchen... All right, why can I not find this? The women aren't fully in focus. All right, sugar, sugar, sugar. Gina is not focused. I have no idea what's going on in her head, but she needs to snap out of it. Risotto. I'm standing there and I'm trying to focus, and I felt like I was just gonna drop on the floor. Gina, what's going on? Um, I'm feeling like I can't function. Okay. Gina has given up already. You're gonna miss everything. I'm sorry that I'm doing this, but... No, let's go. Let's go... I am losing it. The way I'm feeling, I can't continue. I need to speak to a medic. Medic! Gina's screwing us royally right now. Right now, we're prepping. This is our kitchen. We gotta run it. So what are we doing here? Are we operating without Gina? Medic! Medic! Gina, like what the are you doing? We have so much prep. You guys need to get with it, because we're gonna have service really, really soon. We're totally screwed. Right, ladies, are we ready? Can you tell me your name? Do you know where you are right now?
