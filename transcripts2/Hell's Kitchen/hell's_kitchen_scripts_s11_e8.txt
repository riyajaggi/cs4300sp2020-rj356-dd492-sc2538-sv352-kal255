 And got a day out of Hell's Kitchen. It was fun shooting Dan. So therapeutic. I loved it. At dinner service... Jessica... Yes, chef? Halibut is raw. Jessica went belly-up on the fish station. It's raw! Get a grip! And Susan couldn't handle the meat. Oh,. I just dropped my lamb, guys. In the blue kitchen... Beautifully cooked. Thank you, chef.

 Dan was a surprising star. Winner. I'm like Charlie sheen. All I do is win. But Ray's tableside dumplings... I'll take this back. This is cold now, chef. Oh, off, Ray. And Barret's fish... Hey, all of you, come here. Ultimately sank the blue team. Look. Paper. Oh, my God. Chef Ramsay declared no winner for dinner service. Nominate your two weakest chefs for elimination. The men saw an opportunity to get rid of a contentious teammate. The person that we should be putting up right now would be Dan. What? And put him up for elimination. The team's first nominee is myself, chef. This sucks. Along with... Raymond, chef. While the women put up... Susan... And... Jessica. In the end, it was Jessica... Give me your jacket, please. Whose dream of becoming head chef at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill at Caesars Palace... was shattered. * Fire Whoa. * The way you swerve and curve * really wrecks my nerves * and I'm so excited, child ohh! Go, Jon! * When you take what you've got * * and, girl, you've got a lot * you're really smokin', child * when you're hot, you're hot * you really shoot your shot * you're dynamite, child * yeah * well, I can tell by your game * * you're gonna start a flame * love, baby, baby * the way you push, push * lets me know that Hey, hey! * You're good * you're gonna get your wish * oh, no * fire * what I said, child * oww, fire * uh-huh * got me burnin', got me burnin' * And now the continuation of Hell's Kitchen. Now off. I'm so sorry, you guys. I will not disappoint you ever again. I can cook. Get ready, 'cause Dan's gonna be worser than ever to deal with. You guys know that, right? I don't know how Dan keeps dodging the bullet. Chef Ramsay said, "You can cook," but it's because we saved his ass tonight. But what made this even way worser is, chef Ramsay told him he could cook good. Couldn't have been further from the truth. That felt so good. "You can cook." Oh, my God. He said that in front of everybody, so will you all take me a little more seriously now? I'm just gonna go ahead and just do one of these. Good job, Dan. Good job. Way to take it home. I'm about to cheers myself on this one. I'm glad you're here. Thank you. You can tell the passion is there. I mean, I am over the moon with joy that I'm still here in Hell's Kitchen. I sucked tonight. Somebody else is gonna up, and we gonna be in this boat again. It will not happen again. Even though I don't have as much experience in the kitchen, I cannot wait to prove to my team that I deserve to be here. We are definitely winning the next challenge 'cause those can't get their together. With one more dinner service under their belts, the chefs get ready to turn in, one still reliving the day... I drove it home like a champ. And another grateful that it's over. It's been one hell of a day. But in Hell's Kitchen, there's no rest for the weary. Rise and shine. Let's go. All of you. We have an amazing selection of ingredients, and these ingredients are the freshest you'll ever see. Ooh, what's that smell? Let's go. Line up, please, guys. What? Yay! I see farm animals! Yeehaw! Mary... Yes, chef? Please don't get too excited. You will not be butchering these animals. No, I'm excited to "rassle" 'em. Wrestle? What's wrong, Nedra? I am scared. I'm scared of animals, okay? Turkeys and. Come on. I'm scared of my own damn dog. That should tell y'all something. Turkeys are pretty mean, aren't they? Well, you're about to find out. Okay, listen carefully. Here's how the challenge is going to work. One member from each team will enter the pen and herd an animal into one of these cages. Whatever animal you place in that cage, that is the protein you're working with. The name of the starch on top of the cage is a starch. Right? Yes, chef. All of you will have a maximum of ten minutes. Man, this is gonna be easy for me. I've spent some time on a farm. Let's go. I know how to deal with these animals. This is gonna be fun. Okay, right. Red team, blue team, are you ready? Yes, chef. On your mark... Get set... Let's go! For the farm fresh challenge, the teams will have ten minutes to herd animals into cages. Get in there. In there, in there! Oh, you were so close! The animal each chef chooses will determine the protein they will be working with. Nice, Dan! Nice job! And the label on the cage will determine the starch. Go, go, go, go! Well done. Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready. Good, good, good, good. Nedra, let's go. I'm still scared of them, but I'm gonna do it. Go, Nedra! Let's go. Whoo! Open up the gate. At this point, the animals are actually chasing Nedra. It's comedy, but at the same time, the guys are running in and out, no problem. What if we don't get to cook? Aah! Nedra, we're running out of time! Come on, Nedra, you're killing us! With Nedra paralyzed by fear... The blue team charges... Wrestles... Oh, my God! Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in. And manhandles... Ohh! Yeah, Ray. Their way across the finish line. Blue team, well done. Meanwhile... Ooh!. Now! Nedra! Stop calling my name! Got it, babe, herd it, herd it, herd it! Herd it, herd it! Yeah, there you go! There you go! Good job, Nedra! Two minutes to go. And now, with time running down... Good job, Amanda! Good job! The women race to ensure that each of them has a protein to cook. Mary had a little lamb! 40 seconds. Right there! Good job! All right! Well done. With their proteins and starches determined, the chefs quickly gather for the cooking portion of the challenge. Let's go! You know your protein. You know your starch. You've got 40 minutes to come up with a stunning dish. Your time starts now! Good luck. Where's the goat? Where's the goat? Goat, goat. Catch. Catch. Catch. Hell, yeah, let's do it! Ned, what you got, girl? I got turkey and sweet potatoes. I'm taking it back home. There you go. This is something that my mama do. Braised turkey legs, sweet potato, collard greens. I gotta pull this off, so my mama don't kick my ass on this challenge, okay? Right behind you, hot. Right behind you. Let's go, Ray. Yes, chef. I'm doing, uh, two different types of turkey meatballs. My friends love my meatballs. I should open up a meatball factory. You know, I mean, I'm pretty proud of my meatballs. So I'm excited to make meatballs. Chicken stock, anybody? Try and pull off a potato gratin right now. If you have enough time. Cut my potatoes really thin, so they cook really fast. Yeah, cook fast. Just coming up to halfway. How much time? About 23. 23 minutes? Yes. What? I have goat ribs right now. I'm gonna char it on the grill. I've couscous going on top of the oven. I've never cooked goat before in my life. I figure if anybody on the team has a shot at doing it fairly well, it's me. Keep in mind that that yam is sweet. Might want to think about doing glaze. So now I'm checking everybody's food. Finish it with some nice, dry herbs, yeah? Oh, I got it, homes. I got it. I have to make sure every dish is perfect. How do you feel about, like, going classic, right? Lamb and minted potatoes. Classic flavor pairing. Why is this guy trying to coach me on how to cook? Parsnip puree might go really well with that lamb 'cause of the sweetness. Does this guy know who the I am? Chef Zach. Puree? Let's do it. Something like that. I don't need suggestions. Roasted mint potatoes. I'll make it happen. Yep. Last five minutes, guys. Make it count. It's coming up soon. Behind you. Hot pan coming through. Behind, behind, behind, behind. Oven open! Ohh, are you kidding me right now? Oh, my God. I pulled it off. Good job, girl. Good job. 20 seconds to go! Come on! I got my plate. I'm ready to plate. On the plate, on the plate, on the plate. All right, ladies. We're getting close. Seven! Six! Ladies, can I help you with anything? I'm done plating. Watch out, watch out, watch out. Three... Whoo! Two...One... Sorry. And stop! Good job, ladies. Good job, ladies. Okay, listen carefully. You may have cooked seven dishes, but I'm only judging five, one of each protein. As a team, decide whose dishes you want to drop. After a quick discussion, the women eliminate Cyndi and Jacqueline's dishes. Happy with what you dropped? Yes, chef. I want our team to win, and if that means me and Jackie has to sit out, you know, that's fine. Right, gents. On the blue team... My a little bit over. Jon takes himself out of the running. Whose duck are you dropping? Jon's, chef. Pass it down. And now they must decide whether to serve Dan... I'm confident in mine. I don't know, Dan. Or Michael's goat. I wanna go with Michael's. Yeah. Right, whose goat are you dropping? I guess we're dropping mine, chef. Apparently, Michael has some kind of "cooking skill," and I don't. Line up in front of your dishes. Let's go. Red team, blue team, your proteins will go head-to-head. But I am not gonna be judging this alone. I have invited a very special guest this morning. Food & Wine Magazine recently voted him best new chef in the country. Wow. He is the cofounder and owner of one of L.A.'s hottest restaurants, Animal. Please give a warm welcome to Jon Shook. Chef, good to see you. I definitely respect chef Shook, and I've been trying to go to Animal for a long time. I'm excited. It's a huge honor. I appreciate you giving up your busy day to be here. Yeah, I'm excited to eat some animals. Good. Good, good, good. We're gonna start off with... The battle of the turkey. Let's go. Let's go. First up, it's Nedra versus Ray. Okay. Nedra, let's go first, please. Um, I just was taking it back home... Turkey legs and sweet potatoes with some sweet potato strings. Just left the whole thing... looks like something from Captain Caveman. Would you not take the meat off the bone or... I was trying to keep it rustic! You talkin' about it look like Captain Caveman. Let's just see how it's gonna taste compared to old man Ray. You definitely have plenty of salt on this, which is good. To me, I think the turkey legs could have been cooked a little bit longer. Yeah. And also, I like the heat. But needs a touch more cooking. Yes. Thank you. Ray. I made two types of turkey meatballs. Ray, you got a lot of balls, literally. Um... Just a little dry for me. Yeah. Okay. It needs sauce, Ray. Yes, chef. Uh, Jon, if you had to choose one... Just personally, I would go with the red team. Whoo! That dish represent my mom. How awesome is that? I just said, "I'm gonna go with what I know," and I went with what I knew, okay? Thank you, chef. With Nedra's turkey giving the red team an early leg up... Okay, uh, battle of the duck. Let's go. It's now time for Susan's duck breast with citrus quinoa... It's a pretty basic dish, but it's actually pretty tasty. To go head-to-head against Anthony's seared duck with jasmine rice. Your duck's cooked good once again, which is good to see. But the crispy duck on the inside is almost too crispy. It sticks... it's sticking in my teeth. I think for this one too, chef, I'd have to pick the red team. Red team. Wow. Thank you. Thank you, chef. Good job. Way to go. With the red team adding to their lead... Okay, next up. Um, lamb. Let's go. Zach is hoping to get the men on the board with his lamb and roasted potatoes. I do enjoy your dish a lot. Good. The greens worked beautifully. Yeah. Mary, please. As for Mary's pecan-crusted lamb with couscous... I mean, it's raw. I don't want to kill chef Ramsay. I don't want to kill him either. It doesn't even stand a chance. This one, I would have to go with the blue team. Okay. Thanks, chef. Thank you. Sorry about that, chef. Mary, Mary, quite contrary. Good job, Zach. Get it together, woman! Uh, ladies, you're still in the lead, two to one. Amanda and Barret, let's go. Come on, Amanda. Today, I prepared a seared pork, uh, with an onion ragu and a cheesy gratin. It's such a relief to know that my potatoes came through for me. It was like, "Whew." Where your teammate undercooked, you overcooked yours. Let's have a look. That's dry. My first con... concern was getting the potatoes in 'cause I knew that they were gonna take the longest. The hero was the protein, right? Yes, chef. Hopefully your potatoes will outshine his pork dish. Barret, please explain to Jon exactly what we've got here. What I have here is a pan-seared pork. Wow, glistening and absolutely beautiful. Great job. I'm a beast! I mean, just that alone, I don't even have to pick who won, I don't think. I mean, the blue team, definitely. Good job. Really good job. No way, Barret. Congratulations. We got this one. Okay. Ladies, gents... It's 2-2. Time for the goat, please. With the score tied, it all comes down to Ja'nel and Michael. Uh, Ja'nel, please. Today, I prepared for you a goat and wild mushroom ragu. You know, your dish is actually really tasty. How can that be so tender and literally melt in your mouth? It's almost like softer than the polenta. Yeah. Yeah! Ja'nel's goat is tender. It's cooked perfectly. We should get the point. You've nailed that. Thank you, chef. I agree. Michael... Right now, Michael needs to be the chef that he says he is. He needs to bring this home for us and get us this point. Please present your dish to Jon. Okay, um... The score is tied in the farm fresh challenge, and the blue team is counting on Michael's goat to bring home the victory. Michael, please. Okay. Michael, they chose yours over mine. I don't think I have to say this, but please don't mess this up. Essentially, I took a little bit of a risk because it is the rib, and I know it requires a long cooking time. Underneath, I have the couscous. A lot of fresh herbs. The nose on it's great. I... from here. You know, at the end of the day, it's gonna be the rib, I think. Right. Cooking ribs in 45 minutes and not even having a pressure cooker, I mean, that's a risk. Right. This is like something that I would feed my dog... Ohh!. In the backyard, just... It's so tough. Oh, God. No. No, no, no, no... I can't afford a week in the dentist. No. Chef Mike! You should have took some of your own suggestions. Maybe you know how to cook better, and, uh, this won't be happening. You've got all this froufrou going on. And the hero is a zero. I mean, it's pretty much the red team. I mean, there's no other way around that. Wow, red team, congratulations. Great job. Thank you! Whoo! We win! Good job, Ja'nel. Awesome. Good job, baby. We took that loss yesterday. We didn't let it slow us down. And today, we come back with a victory. I'm super pumped. Ladies, great job. Uh, Ja'nel, I mean, that was a very strong finish. Yeah. Thank you, chef. Thank you. Probably, I think, the best dish so far out of all of them was Ja'nel's. Amazing. Yeah, best dish! Amazing, amazing. Um, Dan, did you make a goat dish? Yes, chef. Can we just taste it? Just for argument's sake? I have a rough-cut goat right there, chef, with a roasted red pepper, uh, risotto cake. Mmm. I would have picked this dish over the ribs. I mean, that's delicious. . Next time, maybe talk your teammates into choosing your dish over, uh, the other dish. you guys, all of you. My dish should have been up there, according to chef, and y'all still have no faith. That's fine. Underestimate me. I'd like you to join me in saying a big thank-you to this amazing chef. Jon Shook. Please. Thank you so much, chef! Thank you guys for having me. Congratulations on the restaurant. Thanks. Thank you, Jon. Ladies, one loss, and you come back fighting. Fighting hard. Fighting hard. We have a real treat for you today. All of you are going to become V.I.P. guests at the Aquarium of the Pacific. I love fish. You get a chance to feed penguins... Penguins! And swim with the fishes. A trip to the aquarium in Long Beach. V.I.P. treatment. Snorkeling with sea animals. God, that would be so nice. Ladies, go and get ready, because your limos are waiting. Let's go. Go, go, go. Thank you, chef. Sorry, guys. Blue team, tomorrow night is a unique night in Hell's Kitchen because it's family night. For tomorrow's festivities, all of you have got this miserable task of putting together a petting zoo. Those animals, you have to make sure that their stay in Hell's Kitchen is as comfortable as can be. Oh, my God. Cleaning them up, taking care of them, and cooking for them. Cooking for them? Out you go. I couldn't even contribute to my team today, so don't blame this on me. The blue team looks like jackasses. How fitting. I'm a city boy. I'm from Philadelphia. And now, here I am, chef Zach, a.k.a. Farmer in the Dell. Where to take 'em? Where am I taking 'em? Where am I taking 'em? Hi-ho the merry-o. The farmer in the Dell. There you go. While the men wallow with the pigs... Aww... The women head out for a day at the aquarium. Welcome to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California. Whoo! Here at the Aquarium of the Pacific, we have our seafood for the future seafood advisory program. One of the ways that you, as chefs, can actually help these penguins is by sourcing responsible seafood in your restaurants. Aww. That's awesome. I am scared to feed these penguins. One of them sons of bitches gonna bite my finger off. We need 28 servings of ratatouille. Look at this. They have menus for these animals. The animals eat better than us. This is where your breaking point starts. I passed mine. If you guys would have picked my dish, we would have been fine. Wow. If we would have used my dish, we would have won. No, we wouldn't have. All right. I do have some talent. I don't care if you don't like me as a person. I'm tired of punishment. Get in there. Put it right on the ground. They're definitely hungry. Come on, look. It's okay. Really, I promise. Eat it. Eat. Guys, they're pigs. They eat everything. The fact that they're not eating your ratatouille should say something. While the men serve their animals lunch... Eat the food! The women... Remember, chef, we go for the legs first. Are afraid of being lunch. Oh, my God! This is an opportunity that I never imagined that I would have, and it's just another experience to unite the red team. And we are once again back on our winning streak. Come on. Dan, I think you found your calling. Come on, dude. Let's go laugh at them. Ah ha ha! Yeah. Wanna go this way now? The only time blue team's working as a team it has been, "who are we gonna gang up on now?" I didn't come here for this. I came here to cook. I came here to learn. I'm done walking this. It's not going anywhere. It's just standing there. Okay, why are you handing it to me? Why don't you hand it to one of your teammates? I need a time-out for a second. I'm about to lose my mind. Really? Wow! Uh-oh. Dan. He's a little bitch. He whines about everything. Like, what the 's the matter with you, dude? He's such a little bitch. Shut the up! Maybe he's just hungry. Dan, there's some mashed potatoes with chives and parsley. They didn't eat it. I'm done with you guys. You and your mother! This is the most fun I've had since we've been here. I'm done! Shut up, bitch! After a punishing day cleaning up after farm animals... Dan, there's some mashed potatoes with chives and parsley. One member of the blue team is behaving like a lone wolf. And some ratatouille. Shut up, bitch! Blue team, I'm done with you guys. From now on, I'm just gonna let them fail. My strategy at the competition, this point moving forward, is take care of myself. With a new day comes more work, prepping for tonight's family dinner service. Dan's gonna kill us tonight. Is he on Earth today? And the blue team is trying to figure out what to do... Don't let it stay on the sides. With their problem child. As far as I'm concerned, one bad service, and Dan's out of here. While Dan is clearly the odd man out, the women... What else do we need? At least for the moment... It's nonstick? Seem united. Guys, let's have a really good dinner service. The red team is really feeling good. We're all super focused. We'll be ready to rock this dinner service out. Ladies, honestly, this is our service. So we gonna win. Ladies, line up. Let's go. Uh, gentlemen, let's go. Tonight, it's family night. Big one, this one. A very special, unique evening. Even my own children are gonna be here. They'll be cooked by the blue kitchen tonight. Chef Ramsay, really? You put your family on the blue side? You know the red team has its together. Don't let me down. More importantly, don't let yourselves down. Yes, chef. Jean-Philippe, please, open Hell's Kitchen for family night. Thank you. Oh, they're so cute. I expect tonight's service to be smooth. Check your ovens. Check your temperatures. Just got real again. It's family night in Hell's Kitchen, and for tonight's special event, in addition to his classic menu, chef Ramsay has added a kids' menu featuring margherita pizza, a cheeseburger and fries, and panko-crusted chicken fingers. Uh, how are the children? Oh, they're lovely. Excellent. Here we go, guys! First family in. One risotto, one scallops, one pizza, one burger. Yes, chef! Let's go. Good timing in the kitchen is essential tonight as the children's meals will be served alongside their parents' appetizers to avoid a dining room full of grumpy children. Time, please. How long on that risotto? Uh, two minutes, tops. I'm going with scallops, then. Two minutes on that pizza? Yes. I love pizza. When I go grocery shopping, all I get is, like, frozen pizzas and stuff. How long? I'm ready to walk on pizza. Scallops, 30 seconds. Cut that, please. Bring that risotto yet? I'll take it. Here's the scallops and the burger. Chef, behind you. Pizza, risotto. It's burned. you all. . Come here, all of you! Come on! Hey, look, there's no garnish around there. That's not the biggest bit. Look at that there. me. For a kid. A kid. A kid. Dan is like a monkey wrench in the machine. Killin' me, man. Start again and get it together! Yes, chef! Dan, slow down a second. think what you're doing, please. Dan! You can't brush the oven in front of the pizzas! Yes, chef! Oh, my God. Guys! I should have known it was coming. I mean, the kid's a little bit of a train wreck. And if this kid can't make a simple pizza, I need to step in and pump 'em out. Let me do the pizza. Please let me do the pizza. I got it. I know, but you don't. He keeps yellin' at you. Can I brush it? I just want to get your back. Thank you. We're a team. I'm almost done brushing. If you want to get another two ready, just in case. Or another one, sorry. One. While the men ready their refires... Chef, we're gonna get it together right now. Back in the red kitchen... Risotto walking. Pizza. Yes, chef! Chef, pizza. Chef Ramsay is waiting for... Scallops! Yes, 30 seconds. So their first orders can get out to the dining room. How can we be so late with the scallops? Can somebody wake her up? Push it, push it, push it! Jacqueline... Yes, chef? Come on, you! The easiest dish to cook. Right behind, right behind. Scallops, going up! They're rubber. Scallops are overcooked! Rubber! Rubber. Look at that. Touch that one there. Just touch it there. Come on, get me some more in there! Go, go, Jacqueline. Go! You've got the easiest appetizer. Yes, chef. me. Hey, you. Yes, chef. Okay? Hey, you all. Cold pizza, cold fish and chips. Refire, urgently! What the hell is she thinking? We have to redo a whole ticket over one order of scallops. This sucks. Ladies, this is only gonna happen once, okay? While the red team starts over on their first ticket, out in the dining room, the hungry guests... I don't know if we're eating. Look for other ways to amuse themselves. Where's chef Ramsay? Chef Ramsay's in the kitchen. Chef Ramsay's in there. He's cooking. Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen... How long? Burger's ready. Pizza's ready. Scallops in 30 seconds, Anthony. Yes. The men are ready with their second attempt at their first order. Chef, I think you'll like this one. Scallops, chef. Burger. Here you go, chef. Come on, guys. All we've done since we've been here is fail and lose. We need to pull it together, and we need to do this. Behind, behind, chef. One pizza. Go, please. All right, guys, let's get it the together, huh? It's a half hour into dinner service... Risotto walking. Scallops walking. Very good. Go. And after a rough start, both teams have managed to bounce back, averting disaster in the dining room. Ah, I admire your patience. Yeah? Ah, with a smile. With a smile. And back in the blue kitchen, chef Ramsay delivers the next order. One scallop, one risotto, one burger, one fish and chips. Yes, chef! Uh, guys... And one important detail. That's my family. Yes, chef! One risotto. That's for the fam-fam. There's a lot at stake right here. But we are coming together, and it's almost like a symphony. I got a burger ready to go. I got fries ready. Ah, risotto's looking beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. Chef, fish and chips is right there. Beautiful. Walking with the risottos. Risotto right behind you, chef. Scallops! Scallops! Jon! I'll run. I got your scallops right here, chef. Here you go, brother. Ohh, I love you. Stone cold. Hey, all of you. You first,. Come here. Oh,. No. This can't be happening. Just touch that. Just touch the burger. Oh,, chef. Just touch it. I got one sitting right there, chef. I got another one right there. Who's that table? A cold cheeseburger. How the hell does something like that happen? That's my family. He just brought a perfect storm our way. Thanks, dude. At this stage of the game, I don't expect it, I'm sorry! It's not good enough! It's! An hour and a half into an early family night dinner service, Ray has brought the blue kitchen to a screeching halt. Just touch the burger. Oh,, chef. With a botched cheeseburger for a very important table. That's my family. I have one right there, chef. Get it together, man. A cold burger? I got a burger coming right up here on refire. Hey, you had the audacity to send it to my son. I wouldn't do that to your family. Totally my fault. It was a bad mistake. I will dream of this all night, and I will remember it years from now. Years from now. Burger's right here, Jon. You have fries? I got fries. You're all set. Here's your burger. Go, please. The blue team's refires have made it out of the kitchen... Thank you. Bon appetit. And to chef Ramsay's family. My stomach's sinking 'cause I shouldn't have served that burger. And the blue team... That's all right. That's all right, baby. Keep going. Keep going, chef. Pulls together to catch up on their tickets. Stay focused, boys. Stay focused, that's it. It's just food. Meanwhile, the red team... Service, please. Has completed their appetizers and children's meals. You, two Wellington, one halibut. Yes, chef! Fries, how long? Jack, how long do you need? I got six minutes. Six minutes, heard. It's now up to Mary, on meat, and Jacqueline, on fish, to really deliver on entrees. Let's go. Yes, chef! I'm kind of freaking out. I've been nominated for elimination three times. And I have no more chances left. I'm walking! Halibut garnish following. Chef, two Wellingtons. Where's the garnish? Hot, behind you. Mary! Yes, chef? They're beautifully cooked. Beautiful! Service, please. Mary has led her team to a successful start on entrees... Good job, Mary! Mary's made a full, like, 180. She's really coming into her own right now. Keep it going! Impressing her team... Wow. And their guests. Meanwhile, over in the blue kitchen... Away now, Barret. Wake up! Yes, chef. It's now Barret's turn to impress on the meat station. One halibut, one lamb, one bass. Let's go! Yes, chef! We've won a challenge. And one service. This is where Barret needs to pull through. You about a minute and a half out? Yes, minute and a half out! Michael, it's not cutting. Oh, there it is. Okay. That's raw. I'm gonna put it back in. Guys, lamb's gotta go in for 30, 40 seconds more. Heard. What am I doing wrong? Maybe I'm not searing it long enough. Maybe I'm not leaving it in the oven long enough. Maybe my oven temperature's too low. Whatever it is, I gotta figure it out and figure it out fast. Walking with halibut! Walking with the bass! On your side, chef. Lamb! Lamb's coming, chef. That's raw. Don't send it, then! Actually, you know what, Barret? Take it up there. 'Cause I will actually enjoy this. Come on, leave me, leave me, leave me. All right, all right, all right. The lamb's raw. Stop! I got another one going in, chef. Barret, if you knew it was raw, why'd you bring it up to me? I'm sorry, chef. Get it in the oven! Okay. Take the thing! Got it, chef. Go, chef, go, chef, go! I know that lamb is a bitch, but tie your boots up, grab your, and let's go! Get it in the oven! I got it. I believe in you. Get it done. While Barret's teammates try to encourage him... We got it, buddy, come on. Out in the dining room, the customers... Where's our food? Not surprisingly are getting a little discouraged. Lamb! Piping hot sauce! 60 seconds on that, chef. Come on, Barret, please! Lamb coming to the window. Behind, behind, behind. Lamb coming to the window. Let's go. Here you go, chef. Go, please. With Barret's successful refire on the lamb, the men are beginning to push out entrees. That looks amazing. Wow. Mmm. Meanwhile... Behind, behind. Behind. The red team... Right here, chef. Service, please. Has completed over half of their entrees. Good job, ladies. But chef Ramsay is determined to get the blue side of the dining room fed in sync with the red. Chicken, lamb, Wellington, halibut... how long? Barret, chicken? Two? Ready. Bass and chicken, right? Are you good? It's cooked enough? This is cooked enough, right? Dude, are you... do you need a second opinion? Yeah, second opinion. Need a second opinion. It's... I don't know if he would kick that back. Nah, he'd kick that back. Barret, are you serious? That shouldn't go in the window. No way in hell, man. Barret, how long? Not yet. I'm dragging the chicken. Barret, nothing's coming out! We got it, chef. We're working on it. While Barret's inconsistency on the meat station has stalled the blue kitchen once again... It's going in the oven right now. Back in the red kitchen... Pork, bass, Wellington... how long? Four minutes, chef! The women are just one ticket away from finishing. Last ticket. Let's go. Yes, chef. Ned, do you have the Wellington garnish? Yes, chef! Let's keep moving. Everything's just clicking. We're moving. We're talking. Things are going. Timing is perfect. This is what chef Ramsay is looking for. Set up all the garnish, then slice your Wellington. I'll walk with the bass together. Heard. I'm walking with garnish. Wellington. Pork, Mary. Yes, chef! Heard! Ready on bass! Ready on the bass! Mary, let's go! Coming right now, chef! Behind you. Here's the Wellington. Wellington's over there. Here's the pork. Service, please. Good job, ladies! Ladies, come here! Great job. The dining room is full with children. Jump into the blue team and help me get their entrees out. Let's go, all of you. All of you. Yes, chef. I don't want to be a jerk, but we're totally blowing these boys out of the water, and I'm really, thoroughly enjoying it. Barret, what you got? I'll help you. I'm good. Stay off my station. I'm good, I'm good. The blue team, they looking at us like, "Ah ah ah ah ah! I don't need no help." Evidently, you do 'cause this is a total cluster. One chicken here. I've got raw chicken here. That's for my wife. Hey! For chef James's wife, pink chicken. Raw fish, people can survive. Undercooked meat, you can cook it more. Like, it's not gonna kill you. raw chicken will kill you. Chef James's wife is pregnant. Oh, my gosh. I can't even look chef James in the eye. He's like a triple black belt in Tae Kwon Do. This dude could probably me up right now. My family and James's family! Red team, take over! Let's go! drive them! It's two hours into dinner service... Hey! For chef James's wife, pink chicken. And Barret's fatal mistake... Chef James's wife is pregnant. Oh, my gosh. Has pushed chef Ramsay to take drastic action. Red team, take over! Let's go! Yes, chef! Move! Do you have more chicken down? Yeah, one's in. Y'all know I'm not enjoying this, right? Yeah. You wanna check your chicken, make sure it's good? It's not good yet. I think the blue team doesn't seem like they want our help, but once Barret sends up that raw chicken, he doesn't have anything else to say to me. We need five minutes, six mites. Six minutes out on that chicken! Six minutes! Mary is on the money tonight. I'm like, "Dang, Mary!" The little lamb has spoken up. Jon, you're good? I'm listening to your times, and I'm timing myself. Awesome. Get it, bitch! Get it. When Jon's ready to walk, we're ready to walk. Okay. Let garnish go first. Garnish walking. Walking the chicken. Chicken. When you're walking... Mary, thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. I'm the chef to beat tonight. We just needed to make sure that it was perfect. I'm stronger and stronger every day, and I'm gonna come out on top. Come on, guys. Finish strong! With the women's help... Service! The men have humbly finished their entrees, and every diner has now been served. Mmm, yeah. That is good. Thank you, guys. You're welcome, chef. I don't know what we would have done without you. All we needed to do was refire one thing. I'm gonna beat myself up for the next couple hours about the service. It's pretty embarrassing. They just communicate way better than we do, guys. That's it. Blue team, come here. You are getting killed by the women. Blue team, two words that all of you have become very familiar with... "You've lost." Head upstairs. Nominate your two weakest chefs. Get out of here, guys. My blood's boiling right now. I don't need this. These people could just crash and burn. If you can't do your job, I get you the out of there. I never worked with so many amateurs in this business in my life. Everybody has to talk in this place. It's a show. Does anybody know what they're doing? I know what the 's going on! Maybe this is how I need to be in the kitchen. 'Cause I'm hot right now. I'm embarrassed. Ray, the burger. I don't know what to tell you. All night long, my burgers were perfect. I only messed up one thing. It just happened to be chef Ramsay's kid. I am not the weakest chef tonight. I'm telling you, I'm not. Barret, raw chicken to chef James's pregnant wife. Like, seriously. Barret, you're moving backwards. You gotta get your head out of your, man, please. I don't blame anybody for putting me up there. I shouldn't have put that chicken out. I should have checked it again and again. But I'm not the only one who up. Dan should be going home tonight. He's not a team player. If I'm basing it on the whole thing, it would be Dan. Today on prep, you were pussyfooting around. And Dan us out of the gate with the pizzas. If you're gonna put me up for some reasons, that's fine. Chef Ramsay knows better. He sees what's going on. At some point in time, y'all wake up. Honestly. Some point in time, you gotta really wake the up. All he's gonna do is he's gonna go through his whole life complaining. I'm not talking to you right now, so shut the up. If I wasn't here, I'd punch you in the face. But we are here, so... Exactly. You ain't gonna do, so shut up. Don't say nothin'. Don't worry. You ain't gonna do, Barret. You're just a little girl. * Blue team, have you reached a decision? Yes, chef. Jon, first nominee and why, please. First nominee is Barret, chef. Solely based on the chicken that was raw for chef James's wife. Seven months pregnant. Second nominee and why. The second nominee... After an epic failure on the family night dinner service, the blue team was forced to nominate two chefs for elimination. Their first selection was... Barret, chef. Second nominee and why. The second nominee... Uh... Is Dan. Dan walked around all day with a thumb up his. It's like he just could care less about being part of the team and helping us succeed. Dan, Barret. Step forward, please. Let's go. Dan, why do you think you should stay in Hell's Kitchen? I think I should stay in Hell's Kitchen 'cause I showed you that I do know how to cook. What? How can we screw up a pizza, Dan? You are becoming a bit of an outcast. The team almost despise you. My team doesn't like me. I don't give a. I'm not expecting you to be best friends, but you have to work together. Barret. At this stage of the game, you should be getting stronger. I am getting stronger, chef. You... No, I... I get knocked down, I get back up. You're going backwards. And at times, watching you, I don't think you give a. I do give a. Really? It's not just about the fancy hair and... No, really. You got a funny way of showing it. The person leaving Hell's Kitchen... * Dan. Give me your jacket, big boy. Your time is done. Thank you, chef. Thank you. Barret, you are a weapons-grade douchebag. Zach, you're a two-faced. Michael, you are s- t-o-o-p-i-d stupid. My message to the blue team is shove it up your. Blue team, you have managed one win out of six dinner services. One win! Out of six challenges! Unless I see a major upgrade, I will be eliminating more than one at a time. Get out of here. Being dominated like this is just embarrassing. But, you know, we can all say, "Oh, it's a new blue team. Oh, it's gonna change." Until you prove it in that kitchen, it don't mean. The red team, although we're on a winning streak, we're beating a horrible team. Call me crazy, but just women might be the final six. This is my dream. For him to say that to me, it really bothers me. really, really just... Dan was just too much of a wild card. There's no way I'm betting a restaurant in Vegas on him. Next time... Somebody get me the out of here now. One chef loses his confidence... I'm sick of losing. What the, man? And you won't believe what happens... When he loses his mind. Damn, you pulled a Britney Spears on us. And a surprise ingredient from the red team... Um, I found a hair in my food. Pretty disgusting. God almighty. A hair? Unleashes a firestorm in the kitchen. I want better! Go home! That spreads to the dorms. I'm not shutting the up! You're going on and on and on, and it's done! And threatens to drive one chef out of Hell's Kitchen... I'm just packing my. Forever. Bitch, I'm not gonna take it anymore. And she may not be the only one. Ray, I'm done! It's over. Over! All next time on a cutthroat... raw! This is a disaster. Hell's Kitchen.
