 Previously on Hell's Kitchen... Go! In a challenge that tested the team's palates... Pork, chef. Wrong! The blue team was baffled. Kangaroo, chef? Wrong! , man. When was the last time you had a kangaroo meatball? While the red team... Veal, chef! Is it veal? Yes! Whoo! Go, go, go, go, go!

 Led by Ja'nel and Jacqueline... Swordfish! Swordfish! Yeah! Yes! Continue their challenge domination with their fourth consecutive win. If I was on the guys' team right now, I'd be begging for a sex change. The women were rewarded with a beach day in Malibu... O-M-G. Amazing. While the men... This is . Made homemade bread. I've never done anything so hard in my life.

 Then, an early-morning wake-up... Led to a surprise breakfast service. We will be feeding emergency doctors, nurses, and EMTs. In the blue kitchen... How much longer on you guys's Benny? Jeremy was stuck in slow motion... Jeremy, walk. Come 'round then, big boy! And made a ridiculous mistake. Some disgusting pig brought me the sample scrambled eggs that I cooked an hour ago! Like, "Duh..." On the red side... Nedra! Wakey, wakey. Nedra's eggs Benedict... Why you used the soggy one? And Jacqueline's pancakes... Look at me. Too dark! It's a breakfast. Come on. Put the women behind. Walking! Walking! Behind, behind, behind. Go, go, go. And the men... Congratulations, blue team! Finally! Managed to get a victory. We just lost. I am so stoked right now. The women picked two for elimination... It has to be Jackie and Nedra. But Nedra fought back. I'm the bitch who kept the station going! So y'all if y'all don't wanna save me! Who's gonna go up instead of you? Mary! She's weak. In the end, the nominees were... Jacqueline, chef. And... Mary. But chef Ramsay had his eye on someone else. You two, back in line. Thank you, chef. Oh, my God. Find out right now. There is one of you here that is in way over their head. Who will lose their chance to become head chef of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill at Caesar's palace. The person leaving Hell's Kitchen is... * Fire Whoa... * The way you swerve and curve * * really wrecks my nerves * and I'm so excited, child Go, Jon! * When you shake what you've got * * and, girl, you've got a lot * * you're really somethin', child * * When you're hot, you're hot * * you really shoot your shot * you're dynamite, child * yeah * well, I can tell by your game * * you're gonna start a flame * love, baby, baby * the way you push, push * lets me know that Hey, hey! * You're gonna get your wish * oh, no * fire * what I said, child * oww, fire * uh-huh Sync by IgoPH | Corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com And now, the continuation of Hell's Kitchen. Mary, Jacqueline. You two, back in line. Thank you, chef. Oh, my God. There is one of you here that is in way over their heads. The person leaving Hell's Kitchen is... Jeremy. Get your ass up here. You've done something that I have never seen, ever. You brought up a sample plate. Give me your jacket. Your time is done in Hell's Kitchen. Thank you, chef Ramsay. Thank you. Wow. I don't know what I was thinking. It was my fault. I brought up the wrong plate. But I've learned a lot about myself. I know I'm a fighter. And above all, I'm a great chef. Men, you won today, in spite of Jeremy, so your reward is me getting rid of him. We're stronger without him, chef. Now, both teams, get your crap together, because I am going to start cutting dead weight. We will be open for dinner service tonight. Got it? Yes, chef. Piss off. I would never in a million years think that chef Ramsay would send home one of the blue team, even though it is kind of a blessing in disguise, because Jeremy was really useless to us. That's... hey, better for us. Better for us. Everything happens for a reason. I'm sorry he had to go, but I'm glad that chef Ramsay knows that I'm more talented than Jeremy is. It is definitely a chance at redemption. And tonight, I'm gonna prove myself. The overall, you know, mood, I would say, of the team right now, is somber. Where do you guys wanna go? Big bedroom. A lot of words were said. A lot of anger was had. I just hope that the rest of the ladies swallow their pride and just move forward. We just have to execute. If we can execute, we'll be fine. Are you gonna be okay? What do you need? Could have been me. It could have been anybody. Amanda is the only person who felt like I should have went up... I gotta watch her. All this cutie-cutie, buddy-buddy, girly-girly is done. Come here. I have no hard feelings against you, and I want you to know that. Oh, my God. I nominated Nedra. If Nedra holds it against me, that's gonna be the downfall of herself and the team, 'cause we need her for service. I just don't want any hard feelings between us. No. Okay? Come here. I remain friendly with her to keep the peace and the morale of the red team. I don't want to lose any of you guys. I'm not a person who gives up or folds, so I'm gonna fight. We're cool. We're cool? After some stressful time up in the dorm... Let's go, ladies. The chefs return to prep for dinner service, which is only a few hours away. Start prepping. Yes, chef. But one chef is worried... Do you feel nauseous? About being late. I'm all right. I just would rather know if I'm just, like, nauseous or pregnant and nauseous. My period's really late. I've been nauseous a lot of days in a row, and so I'm nervous. I have to pee so bad. To me, there's no excuses. You're pregnant or you're not, it doesn't matter. If you throw up, you throw up, you get back on the line. Mmm! I can't worry about another bitch's problems. I need to worry about my problems. But she needs to get that together, boop! Really? Yeah. Mary's getting her little testy. I'll be really excited if I'm pregnant, but I'm also... I mean, I'm nervous. I don't know what that means for the competition if I am. Definitely not! Just so you know. Definitely not. Like, instantly, it came up. I just wanna cook. That's it. I don't wanna deal with all this other . Keep goin'! With Mary's big question answered, the red team refocuses their attention on getting ready for dinner. But in the blue kitchen, it's Dan... All right, stupid question. Frisee, what does that go with again? Who's looking for answers. Asparagus. Okay. That's what I thought. I just wanted to verify. That's the one I'm least familiar with. I got the asparagus. We got eggs. Endive feathers? That's what I'm missing. Endive feathers. Once again, I'm really worried about Dan the most, going into tonight's service because I just question his food knowledge and his experience. All right, I got these dressings lined up correctly, right? And these are cut into quarters or sixths? All right, what do you need from me, boss hogg? Lemon tarts. Lemon tarts, lemon tarts. How do we make those? Dude, are you serious? Are you a chef or... what are you? What are you doing here? Little pastry cups. In the pastry cups? He doesn't know what he's doing. It's like, dude, either man up or get the out. Do you have the empty ones down there? You can't use that. After a very early morning wake-up for breakfast service, followed by a non-stop prep for dinner service... All right, let's get the hell out of here, come on. The teams are given a short break. Big room. Flat-out, we got a stronger team than they do right now. Even with Ray? I like us right now. Hell, yeah. Just keep it going. Mary, I like that fight, baby. Thank you. Yeah, girl. Yeah, for real. I think it's great. Earlier today, the girls put Mary up. Mary fought back. I made my mistakes, but I didn't let it get me down, and I picked back up, chef. And Mary, always remember how they was talking. No, they love me. Don't you believe that, Mary. You know what? Shut your mouth. Mary, they threw you under the bus faster than anything. Seriously. Don't even talk to me anymore, I'm serious. Okay. Aww. Bye, Mary. That's her angry voice. Whoa! What happened, Mary? The guys are being jerks, and they're talking crap to me. Shut up! If you can't win because you're good, then don't try to win by shooting us down, you know what I mean? Like, I'm pissed. They're laughing. I'm-a just go hammer time on all of them. It's a couple people I want to cross my path. I can just hammer to 'em. Oh, . What up? Listen, it's okay to antagonize people who can handle it. Don't do that to people who's weak. That's up. So whoever it was, y'all can kiss a big , okay? Competition's getting heated up. The red team's starting to really... I feel like they're cracking, man. So it's fun to with 'em. So who was the bitch who did it? Who did what? Antagonizing people. Ain't nobody antagonizing nobody. All right, well don't say nothin' to her. Did we say somethin' to y'all when y'all got up two nights in a row? No. So don't say to us. Say something to her when you can win a challenge. All right, heard. 'Cause I'll tell y'all some , quick fast, in a hurry. Ohh. You don't wanna with me. I'm Mike Tyson, bitch. Ring the bell if you wanna play. Ring it. Ring it, bitches, ring it. Ding-ding. Ding-ding-ding. Well, let's go, ! No, no, no, no, no. The chefs take a quick break before their second service of the day. I like us right now. But after the men tease Mary... Don't even talk to me anymore, I'm serious. That's her angry voice. Nedra... So who was the bitch antagonizing people? Is ready to pick a fight. Ring the bell if you want to play. Ding-ding. Ding-ding-ding. Well, let's go, ! No, no, no, no, no. Look, I don't want to say nothin'. Okay, that's what I thought. Get y'all together. Smooches! They ain't had nothing to say. That's what I thought. Guys, don't cook with your emotions. Unless it's fire and passion. Yeah. I don't give a . You think I'm here to make friends with the females? Uh-uh, I'm here to win a challenge with my boys in blue. Nedra can try to blow the house down for all I care. I can almost guarantee a win tonight. So it's on and popping now, bitch. I'm ready to, seriously, like, tear it up. I am like, so "Game on" right now. I want to blow their out. With both teams in a fighting mood... Show 'em what we're made of, ladies. And dinner service less than an hour away... Let's go, let's go, let's go, guys. Quickly. Big night. Chef Ramsay wants the chefs to focus on the task at hand. We've had some respectable moments in Hell's Kitchen so far, yes? Yes, chef. But nowhere near the consistency, okay, that we really need. And if the kitchen isn't running properly, the ones that are taking the brunt of it are Jean-Philippe and his wait staff. Uh, Jean-Philippe, please. Can you give both the red team and the blue team a little insight to how much crap you have to take sometimes. Frankly, honestly, it's been an absolute, living nightmare. No, on my hands and my knees with every single table. I'm sorry, I do have a bit of proud though. Jamie, come over, please. Give us a little insight into the kind of crap that you've had to endure as well, please. I almost lost my job the other night. I had a table, and I watched them complain to Jean-Philippe about me. Jean-Philippe called me in there to reprimand me, and that's when he found out it was because of the kitchen. I have never been a waiter, but I feel terrible. You can really mess up someone's life if you're a bad cook. I had a couple that came from Arizona. It was their vacation to come here and eat. Two hours later, when they didn't eat, out of frustration, they got up and they left. I don't like waiters. 'em, they're annoying. Nothing could have bummed me out more than that. I know they go through some , but so do we. So tonight, I want one individual from each team to be a waiter. Tonight's redemption. Tonight, we give back. Tonight, we support them a little bit more. Ladies... Jessica... Yes, chef? Dining room tonight. Yes, chef. I've never been a server my entire life. In my heart, I don't want to be out there, but I'm doing it for the team. Men... Barret. Tonight, you're the blue team's waiter. Yes, chef. We're opening in just under 30 minutes from now. Let's go. Yes, chef! Are you kidding me? I got no time. Takes me a half hour to do my hair. I gotta rinse it, blow-dry it, straighten it. Then put the glue in it, and then check it, and then check it again. And then spray it, and then check it again. It's a half hour process just to get my hair this way. Barret? Yes. That's the way you're gonna be looking tonight? Yes. How are you? Yeah? Not too bad, and you? Pleasure to meet you. Good, I'm doing well. Yeah, hi. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? Yeah, good. Keep your smile, because you might need it. It's the only weapon you have to... Okay. I was a waiter for six years. Of course I know how to write a ticket. So I'm super confident... confidence level is up here right now. Right, where's the Belgian muscle? Jean-Philippe, open Hell's Kitchen, please. Let's go. It's a marathon, ladies. We gotta pace ourselves right. Game faces. Now, the amount of mise en place here is extraordinary. Here they come, boys. Tonight, Hell's Kitchen opens for its second service of the day. We gonna do this, ladies? Yeah, we got this! And both teams are confident that they will score a victory. Here we go, boys. But before the teams can start cooking... Jean, what is she doing? They'll need a ticket. She looks confused. Um... Jessica... Yes, chef? Let's go, please. I'm nervous going out into the dining room. I've never been a server. Where's the red? I just want to be back in the kitchen. I would love the pan-seared scallops, please. Okay. Where's Barret? Where's the lizard? What would you like to start off with? Can I do the crab cappellini? Crab cappellini? Excellent choice. Barret! I need some tickets, please. Barret, what's going on there? I'm working on it, chef. No, but come on, Barret. I need a bit of energy in there, yes? Yes, chef. Let's go. Let's start service. Come on, let's start service. Oh, I wanna start service. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Hey! Blue team! Guys, pay attention! On order, four covers, table 23. I mean... ah, me. Look at... hey, hey. Look at the way he wrote that ticket. Look at how badly that's written out. Barret! What happened? Rewrite the ticket! Where's Jean-Philippe? Jean-Philippe, what is that? Oh, my... oh, off. Hey, J.P., take him and yourself back to Belgium. Thanks. right off. off. Hey, Barret, it's not rocket science there, huh? I know. Yeah, you know. I know. I'm sorry. J.P. is like... I just want to grab it and, like, throw it away. But I can't do that. Jessica, why are these tickets taking so long? Sorry, chef. Hey, come here, you... stop. Do you know what I mean? Look. What is that? Huh? Is that two or three? Sorry, chef, that's... what is that? Ah, off, just... Jessica, how long were you in school for? Six months, chef. You only went to school for six months? Yes, chef. . Hurry up. Really? Come on. My handwriting is not that bad. Two seconds. Don't disappear. Yes, chef. Yeah, it's scallops, Risotto. What is that there? Oh, my God. Come on, Barret. You stupid . Wellington. Yeah, but what... I... Barret, you got the whole team riding on your shoulders right now... come on, buddy. Halibut? No, off, Barret. Write it properly. Hey, look at me. Hey, Barret... Yes, chef? I got nothing going out! ng: Next mistake, you're history! Done! Tonight in hell's kitchen, Jessica and Barret are serving as waiters for their teams, but 20 minutes into dinner service, their illegible tickets... What is that there? Have both kitchens at a standstill. Useless. Write it out neatly. Let's go. Hey, Barret. Yes, chef? hair looks beautiful. Tickets look dreadful. Let's go, come on. Yes, chef. Whew. Thanks, chef Ramsay. Appreciate it. I have enough already without this. Huh? I apologize. I don't need this. I apologize. Whatever. I just don't have the best handwriting in the world, so, you know, if... If you want to me to write like a bitch, I guess I'll have to write like a bitch. Thank you. That's better. Yes, chef. Yeah, welcome to the real world. Let's go. Yes, chef. Two twos... two on table 42 and table 41. Let's do two Risotto, two scallops. Yes, chef! Let's go. Susan, I'm waiting on my call for scallops from you. Okay. Susan... Yes, chef? Yeah, you're driving the section, yes? Yes, chef. He asked me to lead, and I do not want to disappoint chef Ramsay. This is absolutely the most nervous I've felt, and the most pressure that I've had since I've been in Hell's Kitchen. Let's go. Wake up, love. One minute, chef! Slow down, slow down. Slow down? Slow down. Okay. Dropping scallops! Scallops, risotto. Come on, ladies. Where are they? Is the lobster ready for the risotto? I'm ready. Yes, yes, let's go. Good, let's go! Behind you, hot. Susan, no. I'm flipping my scallops. Don't walk yet. Behind you, chef. Susan was just really focused on getting those risottos out, which I appreciate, but we need to go up together. Scallops! They should be done. Come on! I'm goin'! I'm walkin'! Scallops walkin'! Behind you. Service, table 41. Let's go. While Susan gets the red kitchen fired up... Careful. Over in the blue kitchen... The men are hoping Barret finally delivers an acceptable ticket so they can fire something. Hey, Barret, plain English. That's better. Ohh, God! Thank you! Here we go, guys. On order, two risotto, one cappellini, one scallops. Yes, chef! Thank you. Drop the scallops. Come on. What's that? The scallops. Okay, how many orders? Two. You sure? Mike. Hello? Two scallops, right? Or is it one? Two scallops, right? It is two? Yep. I don't know what's going on on that fish station right now, but these guys really gotta get it together. All right, great. What do you want me to do for you, man? Nothing. "Can I cook? You gonna let me cook? Can I try? Can I be the limelight?" No. Sorry, no. I need tongs. Can I have tongs, please? Tongs? Yeah. Here you go. Here you go, Ray. Here you go. I'm gonna make your life a little easier. Dude, I wanna cook a few things today too. Why don't you give me some pan time here. Let's go! Yes, chef!

Appetizers are finally making their way out to hungry diners. Enjoy, guys. Thank you. Service, please. And, back in the red kitchen, Susan... We're doing this, ladies! We're not going home tonight! No! No, we're not! Susan, let me know when you're two minutes on risotto. Is not about to let anything slow her down... Looks good, looks good, looks good. Wait to fire scallops, remember... Not even if the rest of the food on the order isn't ready. This is the two, two. Are you ready on risotto? Yes, ready! Walk, walk! Why is nobody waiting for me with the scallops? We're calling out, "Are you ready?" You gotta listen! Pay attention! Talk back! We're talking! Come on, ladies, I got nothing going out. Yes, chef, waiting on the scallops, chef. Susan, this is just complete and absolute . Drive it. Drive it, Susan. Can you walk on that? I can't stop what I'm doing and say to her, "Amanda, two minutes. Drop your scallops now." I mean, come the on. Can we walk? Walk those. Walking with scallops! Scallops, chef. hell. Scallop is raw! . Stone cold in the middle. Who cooked them? I did, chef. Come on! Let's go!

Wakey wakey, Amanda! Yes, chef! Are you ready? Scallops! Right now, chef! Behind you, hot. Good, good, good. Service, please. With Amanda's scallops finally receiving a passing grade... Here we go, yes? Appetizers are leaving the red kitchen once again. Meanwhile, nearly an hour into dinner service, the blue team has almost finished their appetizers... Away now, three scallops, one cappellini. And are now moving on to entrees. Followed by three halibut, one pork, two Wellington. Yes, chef! Look out, I... Ray, I gotta cook these scallops. I understand, buddy. Put 'em on. Well, you gotta be a little bit more organized over here. Excuse me, buddy. Yep. Tell me when you're reaching in front of me. You gotta tell me when you're reaching, Ray. I keep trying to get in there, and I keep getting shut down. He's acting like this is an NBA game, and we're at the bottom of the key. He's just boxing me out. Can I cook a little today? I'm still trying... I'm trying to flip these scallops, man. Are you kidding me? Really? Put a red jacket on, grab your tampons, and go on the red team, please. Can you do a minute and a half? I'm gonna do my best... I just need Ray to stop reaching over me. Easy. Dan, you wanna put the crust on those? It's on it! All right, you're awesome, Dan. Who's better than you? Ray, you gotta give me some space, man. I can't work throwing elbows at you. Really? Stop it, guys. Really? It's about the food now, guys. We're a team here. Come on, guys. We're a team! I can't take much more of this. Shut the up right now and stop fighting and focus on the food. Dan, let's go, buddy. Yeah, come on. I'm workin' it. Oh, . Blue team, I don't know what the you two are doing down there... Tongs. How long? Go ahead. We're coming to the pass. Let's go, then! Three sea bass, yep! Ready? Down the line! Wellington... Time out. Three bass. What do you mean, three bass? I mean, no, two... Look at you, you don't even know what's on the order. Hey, hey, hey. What is that? They asked for three... Three halibuts! That's what we're going with. He doesn't even know. Oh, my God. That's bass! That's not halibut! I know that's bass, dude. I know that. What... Start that table again! Three halibut, one pork, two Wellington. Never mind, I got it, I got it, I got it. Dan, Dan, Dan. Hey, dumber and dumber. Yes, chef? Talk to your team, and one of you give me a time! Yes, chef. Five minutes. Five... at least five minutes. Five minutes? Yeah. hell. While Ray and Dan get the right fish in the pan, out in the dining room, Barret is doing his best to keep impatient diners happy. How are you guys doing over here so far? Starving. Okay, I'm gonna check on the food and see how much longer I'll be for you. Okay? Thank you. I never wanna do this again. And, back in the red kitchen... Three risotto, one scallops. It's a little loose, chef. It's coming. Come on, then, let's go. Yes, chef. Susan and Amanda are working on their final appetizers. Nice color, Amanda. Let's go. Scallops in less than a minute. It's all you guys on this ticket, so you guys have to talk to each other. Susan's really struggling with Amanda tonight. We don't communicate. It's like people are clams sometimes. I'm ready on scallops. I need to walk. No, not yet. Walkin' one scallop! Behind you. Oh, no. Risotto. How we lookin'? How we lookin'? I got it, I got it. Just get the salad. Okay, thank you. Come on, yeah? We're waiting! Coming, chef! Yeah, come on, Susan! Let's go. Susan, just go. Go. Go! Pick it up. Coming, chef. Right behind you, chef. It's undercooked, the rice. Wow. me. Hey. Hey. The rice is undercooked! The rice is undercooked. That's not ready yet, guys. Start again! Yes, chef. Come on. What are you waiting on? 34, chef. Yeah, c-c-come in here. Come in here! How long they been waiting? 20, 30 minutes, chef. Yeah, they've been actually waiting 32 minutes. Tell your team. Let's go, guys! Table 34... No! Why you laughing? I'm not. I'm sorry, chef. Hey, hey, all of you. Stop. Come here. all of you. You think this is a joke? No, chef, I don't. We're dying on table 34's appetizers, and you come in and laugh at her. What's funny? Nothing, chef. Do you want to go? Do you want to go? Nearly two hours into dinner service... Come in here! Susan's undercooked risotto is holding up the red team's final appetizer order. Tell your team! And though it's clearly not a laughing matter... Let's go, guys! Table 34. For some reason, Jessica can't seem to keep a straight face. You think this is a joke? Hey, all of you, stop. We're dying on table 34's appetizers, and you come in and laugh at her. What's funny? Nothing, chef. Do you want to go? No, chef, I don't. Can you tell your team to hurry up? Let's go, team! I'm ready! Hey, it's not so funny now, is it? No, chef. Everything he says, he's serious. If you bust a laugh, you might as well throw in the towel, home girl. Get me that risotto now! Behind you. Coming, chef! Right now, walking! Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Actually tastes quite nice. Go. The red team moves on to entrees. Two halibut, one pappardelle, one bass! Yes, chef! But in the blue dining room, instead of serving Ray's fish... They haven't gotten their food yet. There's only so much I can do, you know? Barret is busy serving up apologies. I'm used to kitchen etiquette. I'm sorry, guys. All right, sorry, guys. Okay, guys? I'm sorry about that. If you need anything, listen, just throw a piece of bread at me. It'll probably get stuck in my hair, so...I'm okay. If I have to go in there myself and kick everybody out to cook, I will get you guys fed, I promise. Ray! Well, maybe not. What are you waiting on? Three halibut and pork. Yeah? So how about asking them? How 'bout asking your ... hey! Hey. Hey, hello. Do some , will you? Yes, chef. Raymond, how long? Two minutes on the halibut. You ready with the pork, Anthony? I've got pork and two Wellington ready to go, yes. Hey, Barret, do you understand how painful this is? Yes, chef. He's been waiting 17 minutes. How long, Ray? It's ready to serve, chef. Before, with the fish station, I had a hiccup. But don't worry, I have it. Two Wellingtons and a pork are ready to go. There, go. Behind you. Behind. Two Wellington, one pork. Wellington's cooked perfectly. Don't over-reduce the sauce. Thank you, chef, yes! Come on, Ray! Yes, chef! Right here! Walk up with it. Those better be the best halibut. It's not hard. Here you go, chef. What has he done to that? Hey, all of you. Come here. Yes, chef? All of you! Yes, chef? You first. Just touch that. Just touch. It's just dry. Overcooked. Dry! That's ridiculous. Un...believable. Hey! Hey! Hey. Dan! Raymond! You made me wait. Yes, chef. And then I wait! And then I wait! And then you me! Didn't mean to, chef. I'm sinking with this ship right now. And the best part is, I couldn't even do anything about it, 'cause, uh, Ray wouldn't let me cook. Hey! Anthony! Chef! Take all your perfectly cooked Wellingtons... ! , if I have to kick someone out of the kitchen myself, they're getting out. I'd be furious. Every meat you've cooked tonight has been perfect. Yes, chef. Sabotaged by somebody who's not even cooking it! All right, you guys gotta... damn it. Come on, guys, pull it back together!

Give me six minutes, chef! Six minutes? What are you doing to me? Guys, you're gonna kill the rest of the table! Here you go, Nedra. Here's your six minutes. Take the tray! There you go. Mary, there you go. Yes, chef? She told me she got another one... where is it? It's right here! In the pan, chef! So is that supposed to be funny? No, I'm not laughing, chef! When you say, "I've got one more," you haven't got one more. "I put one more on, chef." Yes, chef! I wanna hear the truth from you a little bit earlier. So I can relate it to the customer! Yes, chef! Get me Jessica. Jessica? Yes, chef? Hey, you. Come here, you. Yes, chef! Can you take this girl, and you explain... how about an apology to the customer? Yes, chef. With a bit of respect. Yes, chef. Hurry up! Yes, chef. Take her there! I'm a real bitch, I'm gonna own up to my . At the end of the day, like, if you don't own up to your , you're full of . Hi. How y'all doin'? I'm Nedra, and, um, I undercooked your LA... uh, pork, so it's gonna be about five more minutes. I do apologize, um, thank you for being so patient. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Nedra. While Nedra begs forgiveness in the dining room, back in the blue kitchen... Where is the halibut? Comin' up, chef. Come on, guys, push it! Let's go, come on. Get those up. Ray hurries to deliver his third attempt at the same order of fish. Where is it? Right here. Bring that up. Got it right here, chef. Come on, come on. Go with that. Good job. Please, be cooked. For the love of God, be cooked. Wellington's beautifully cooked. Thank you, chef. Pork's beautifully cooked. But I have a problem. I have a big problem. Yes, I do! me. This is raw! Oh, my God. This is raw! Not again! Damn it! This can't be happening. Come on, Ray. It's just raw! Get three more going. Get three more going. Three more working. Put 'em in the oven. It's ! We're going down in flames. The Titanic ain't got on us. I'm done! You, you, you, you, you, you, get out! Over two hours into dinner service, and Ray has failed for the third time on the same order. This is raw! As a result, the blue team has yet to serve a single entree, and chef Ramsay, not surprisingly... I'm done! Yes, chef. Has had enough. Get out! Get the out of her! I was doing good, damn it. Did I not say they were done? I will let you know when to leave it in. Dan, just leave it alone. I had it perfect. Hey! Where are you guys? Right here, chef. I've spent 18 hours with you guys today. I give you everything I got, and that's the you're gonna give me in front of chef Ramsay? Make me look like a  in front of a dining room full of people. I'm beside myself right now with that! I can't look at you guys anymore. Red team! Yes, chef? One more mistake, I'm gonna kick you all out. Wake up, wake up, yes, chef! Wake up, wake up, wake up. Yes, chef! 30 on bass. Sea bass walking, chef. Behind you. Okay, I'm walking. Garnish is up. Come on, bubble and squeak. Coming now, chef! Right behind you, Suzy. Yeah, look at the speed of her, as if nothing else matters. Right after that, the pork is coming! Pork! Coming, chef! We're walking with the pork! We cool, we in a box, we got it. Oh, dear. On the board. Yes, chef. Yeah. That's raw. Oh, my God. Come here, all of you! My God. Yeah, kept me waiting 28 minutes for raw pork. You, you, you, you, you, you, you. Get out! Disaster! Get out! Well, we gave it our shot, ladies. Wasn't good enough. To get kicked out of the kitchen makes you feel like the biggest failure in the world. Nedra and Mary, get it together, girls. , we were so close. I think he'd just had enough. Well, obviously he's pissed off because of those idiots. You tell me what you can do. It is what it is. Hello? Get both teams downstairs, now. Yes, chef. Both teams downstairs right now. That was chef Ramsay. Let's go. Leave everything. Move, move, move, move, move. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Stay there! Stay there. We're not done yet. Sous chefs and I are still cooking in there! There's no winning team. You both lost. Think of two individuals from each team that you want rid of! off upstairs. Unbelievable. Honestly, it's so unfortunate that that one pork failed. I'm sorry about that pork. We both touched it. We both thought it was ready. I think it's an extremely easy decision for us. Meat's on the chopping block. What the is going on? I couldn't cook... He wouldn't let me cook anything. I cooked two scallops all night, that was it. Every time I try to do something, he's reaching over, boxing me out. "Oh, I got the . I got the ." He has me stacking scallops all night. I had poor Dan going, "Come on, Ray." Sulkin' on the line, you little bitch! Is he callin' me a little bitch? Don't you dare get the to it. I'm not. I'm just curious. Just let me run the station. It was perfect! This is the fight of my life, and I am not going home over some . You put my ass on the line, I will ruin you. One piece of pork, and I'm gonna go home. You know, like, that sucks. When I say I had it, I say I got it. Guys, shh. Now I look like a . Are they gonna fight? That's my station. No matter what anybody does, it's my station. Our station. "Can I drive? Come on, please, daddy? Can I drive?" Get the out of my face, would you, please? Ray's callin' me a bitch. But Ray's not saying to me. This needs to stop. Boom! Hey, dude, shut the up. "Can I cook? I wanna cook too. Please let me cook." Okay, I don't sound like a child. Stop that. You sound like a little bitch. Every time you ask me for help, you just start reaching across me. That's because you're supposed to be there for support, dude! I was supporting him! If he starts to sink, you hop in! I tried to hop in! Yeah, but I didn't ask you to! You're interfering with me, bitch! Don't call me a bitch. You're a bitch. do something about it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Ray! After the worst dinner service yet, both teams were kicked out of the kitchen and told to nominate two chefs for elimination. For the red team, the decision is an easy one. Our pork failed. One piece of pork, and I'm gonna go home. You know, like, that sucks. But on the blue team, there's been a lot more arguing than decision-making. Stop interfering with me, bitch! Don't call me a bitch. You're a bitch. do something about it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Stop, y'all. stop. Ray, you're gonna throw me under the bus? You want me to go home? you. It's on like Donkey Kong. That was a disaster, right? Yes, chef. Susan... Red team's first nominee and why. Chef, our first nominee this evening is Mary. The biggest downfall of the red team was the raw pork. Second nominee and why. Chef, our second nominee is Nedra, because of the raw pork, chef. Anthony. Chef, blue team's first nominee is Dan. We feel his performance on the fish station tonight, it's what sunk the service. Second nominee and why. Our second nominee was Ray. We had too many dishes come back, and we believe it's the reason we didn't finish service. Blue, fish... Huge problem. Red, meat, disaster. All four of you, step forward. Mary, tell me why you think you should stay in Hell's Kitchen. Chef, I didn't have any other mistakes tonight. Pork was the one mistake. She started it in the pan, and I finished it in the oven. We brought it out. We checked it several times, and it was still raw, and I'm very sorry. And I own that mistake, chef. Nedra. We up on the pork, chef. I can't make excuses. So I'm telling you here today, I apologize. I extremely apologize, and it won't happen again... ever! Ray. I'm telling you, you'll see a lot from me, chef. I'm telling you, I have a lot to give. Don't give up on me, chef. Dan. I'm a team player. I kept trying to support him. Dan, I pull the fish out... Can I finish a sentence, please? No. I pull the fish out... I got nothin' to say, chef. And then you put it back in the oven. I said it was done. I said it was perfect. It was hard. Chef, since they want to argue, I'm gonna fight for my life. I want to be here. They can argue all they want. But I want to be here! Chef, when chef Ray's cooking, you hear Dan saying smart things like, "Ray's in my way," and we can't move forward with somebody like that. He's full of , chef. And, chef, right now, if you don't believe me, as I'm telling you this, he's literally giving me the finger behind his back. Oh, I did. I just gave him the finger, chef. He's what? He's doing like... he's doing like this to me right now... Yeah. Behind your back. This is the kind of attitude that we put up with on a consistent basis. And the team is sick of it. You know, after all this  and the bad performances, I've definitely got the right four here. What I'm struggling with is which one of you to send home. My decision is... Ray. Give me your jacket. Dan! Give me your jacket, please. Nedra, give me your jacket, please. Mary, give me your jacket, please. Tonight... was such a disaster, I've decided to do something I've never, ever, ever done before. All four of you... Next time, chef Ramsay turns the competition on its head. One, two, three, four of you. I'm done. I've had enough. Chef, are you kidding me right now? At dinner service... So how long for the chef's table? With special guests in the kitchen... How long on that lamb? The pressure to perform... I just dropped my lamb. They screwed up our order. Sends the red team into a tailspin... It's becoming chaos. And forces a VIP out the door. It's a nightmare. ! And you won't believe what one chef... I just need to get through this dinner service. Tries to get away with. Hey...All of you, come here. See those six ladies? And look... Ohh. Ohh. What the you doing? You trying to kill people? This is catastrophically terrible. All next time... You're done, aren't you? Is that the best you can do? On Hell's Kitchen.
