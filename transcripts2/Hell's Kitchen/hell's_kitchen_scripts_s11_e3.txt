 I've got it, chef. I'm a monster. On the red side, Gina failed on scallops. Overcooked. And put the blame on Nedra. Mary, do you wanna do scallops? I wanna do scallops. Somebody else has gotta do risotto. Gina, don't throw me under the bus because your ain't right. Get out! Those little bitches. Danielle... Come on, Danielle! Was lost. I'm confused. But chef Ramsay gave her clear direction. Get out! ! Thanks to Jessica... Who cooked the lamb? Me, chef. Perfect. And Nedra... And the risotto was delicious. Thank you, chef. The women rallied. Coming, chef. In the end, the red team was victorious. And after a tense deliberation... You ain't doing it good, playboy. He just stepped on me real hard! The men picked two for elimination. Jeremy. And... Sebastian. My decision is... Sebastian. And with that, Sebastian... It's a kitchen, not a place for comedians. Became the first to leave Hell's Kitchen. Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com And now, the continuation of Hell's Kitchen. That didn't feel good at all. I'm feeling like Jeremy got by on the skin of his teeth, and he got a lot to prove. And he won't be so lucky next time. It'll be adios. Sara-nara. Challenge tomorrow, gentlemen. Can we please win it? Yep. I just get stronger and get stronger. I still have my confidence on winning this competition, but I'm humbled. I got a second chance. Let's start over, all right? I'm gonna have to work a hundred times harder. Tomorrow's a new day. Yep. I don't like to go to sleep angry, so I need to get it off my chest. So don't... at the end of the day, don't throw me under the bus. Who? Uh, you. What? How did I throw you under the bus? How the hell it's my fault the scallops is messed up? The risotto... I didn't say it was your fault! Well, what the hell did you say? Somebody else has gotta do risotto. What do you mean? It's her station. You said I'm the reason why the scallops didn't go out. Nobody's gonna say I said something when I didn't! Well, you don't know what the hell you said right now.? Clearly. Don't laugh at me! She all getting all dramatic and . Bitch, it ain't even that serious. I'm just letting you know what I gotta say. You better watch your "p"s and "q"s because you don't know me. I know you crazy as . Don't call me crazy. And watch how you talk to me. Let's press the bell, bitch, because we can argue. Don't call me bitch! Ding! Don't mess with a heavyweight, and you a lightweight. You're dealing with the wrong person. Yes, I'm dealing with a crazy, deranged person. What a baby. You need to watch yourself. Eh, she pointed her finger at me about the risotto. off. Oh, my God, she just broke the ceiling. Oh, my God. After a combative night in Hell's Kitchen, chef Ramsay has a plan to keep the chefs in the line of fire. Get up! Get up! Let's go! Good morning, gentlemen. Get up now! Get up, get up! Bam. whole military comes flying in. "Get up, get up, get up!" I feel like I was back in boot camp. Move it! Keep moving. They're screaming for me to catch up with my team. Get out there! Hurry up! What team? These little bitches haven't treated me as a team member. So I'm finished with them. Team of one. Get in line. Let's go. Good morning. Good morning, chef. Now, this morning... Excuse me, chef. I have something to say. Please, Gina. Unfortunately, I'm not gonna be staying here for this challenge. I'm gonna be leaving. You're happy to throw the towel in so quickly? I have some personal issues. Unfortunately, I have to. I'm not gonna stop you. Please, go back up to the dorm, pack your stuff, and leave Hell's Kitchen. Thank you, chef. Bye, Gina. Man, right on the team challenge, this stupid bitch backs out. Bitch, you gonna back out of doing a competition? If you can't stand the heat, get out the kitchen. That bitch folded like a piece of wet paper towel. Ladies, one down. Incredible. Stand strong. Yes, chef. Last night, I saw minimum teamwork in both kitchens. Agreed? Yes, chef. The service could have been so much easier if only you relied on each other. Let me show you how a real team works. Soldiers, take it away, please. Come on, let's go! Get up there! These are army people, they start jumping over the wall. Hoorah. Hoorah. Hoorah. Go! Hoorah. Hoorah. And we're all just standing there like, okay, now what the do we have to do? Wow. Good job. That's what I call teamwork. Absolutely. Okay. Chefs... It's your turn to go over the wall. Uh... Oh, my God. My big ass climb over the wall? No. That is... no. That is not going to happen. Soldiers, please. One, two, three. Go, go! Careful, careful, careful. Happier? Yes, chef. Thank God. Now, this morning, you're gonna conquer the wall as a team. Yes, chef. I mean, I'm looking at this wall, and it's like, it's still, like, 8 feet high, and we still gotta get over it. But there's one more thing. Oh, what the ? A live lobster cage. Oh, my God. That's mud. Yeah! I'm so stoked. This is a physical challenge. God, I'm ready to go all out. Listen carefully. Here's how it's gonna work. I want each team to get over that wall. You then go into that cage and pick up one lobster at a time. You've got five minutes to get as many lobsters as you can. Think it's about time that you started showing some form of teamwork. Yes, chef. Your time starts now. For this team-building exercise, each team will have to work together to get their chefs over the wall as quickly as possible so that they can gather as many lobsters as they can in five minutes. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Get out! Seven, eight. Come on, guys. One, two, three. I'm looking at this wall, saying there's no way that I'm getting over this. Got you. But then we had big boy Jeremy boosting us over. Come on. He was just throwing us over like we were all rag dolls. Come on, go, let's go, let's go, let's go! Three minutes to go. Got this, guys. 15, 16. It's really, really close. I realize that, if we can get just a couple more, we could probably beat these boys. We're just gonna dig deep and get it done. 16, 17. Watch out. Last minute! Let's go! Let me go, let me go! Careful. My ankle. My ankle rolled as soon as I got over that wall. Injury or not, we gotta win this challenge. You got this, man, you got this. Ooh! 20 seconds to go! Ahh! Oh, ! Oh! I got you, I got you! Seven, six... Go, go! Five, four, three, two, one! Stop! ! Everybody line up. . Oh, my God. Good job. That is what I call teamwork. Well done! Hell of a job. Chef Andi, the red team's bin. How many lobsters are in there? 31. Wow. Good job, girls. Yeah, ladies! James, in the blue team's bin, how many lobsters are in there? 37. We needed this win. We finally beat the girls. Yeah! Yes! Let's go. Let's take a day off now. Congratulations. Thanks, chef. You won... Nothing. That's right. You honestly thought that was your challenge? That was step one. Now change into your chef jackets upstairs, and meet me in the kitchen. You didn't win . The guys may have won the physical part, but I know, I know that they can't cook for . There's no way we're gonna lose the second part of this challenge. I rolled on my ankle with my full weight coming off that wall. Careful. As soon as... as soon as I hit the ground, my ankle just went right over it. I-I can't put any weight on this right now. Oh, me to nayhill. me. Where's the medic? Praying that I didn't seriously injure myself. There's, you know, not much else we can do. You may have to go to the hospital and get some x-rays. Yeah. See if anything's broken. I can't... I can't get taken out of this. I can't be down. Yeah, I'm pretty scared right now. With their lobsters collected... Watch out. Whoo! The chefs quickly dress for the second part of the challenge. Well, all of the chefs but one. I can't get taken out of this. I can't be down. Dude, I can't sit here, like... do me a favor. I need to get into my whites, dude. We cannot go three losses in a row. Ankle be damned. I can still cook. This is nothing. I can cook one-legged. You okay? I'm feeling good, chef. You sure? Sprained? It's something, chef. It's pretty swollen right now. I admire your dedication. Uh, red team. Great job. 31 lobsters. Blue team, 37 lobsters. Now let me tell you what the real challenge is. The goal is to clean as many stunning lobsters as you can. I have never cleaned a lobster. Let me show you. Take off your claws. Knife on. Twist. Claw number one. And extract all of the lobster meat. And just pull that tail out. Wow. Tail, head. I mean, even the legs. I didn't even know there was meat in the legs. I mean, that was some pretty substantial cleaning. So I'm a little bit nervous. One presented lobster, out of its shell. Wow. Once you've completed the lobster on the plate, you'll come up your side of the pass, ring the bell. If it's good, gets a point. Blue team, as you know, you captured 37. Red team, 31. Yes, chef. So you have to be a little bit more careful, right? Yes, chef. Both teams, you've got ten minutes for this challenge. I'm from Boston, and, I mean, lobsters are just everything. I've been doing this all my life. This is like a no-brainer. Your ten minutes starts now. Go, girls. I'm gonna grab the lobster. Grab a plate. For the second part of a team-building challenge... Do you wanna go there? The chefs will pair up... I'll do the tail and the claws? And have ten minutes to extract the meat from as many lobsters as they can. Behind, behind. Let's go, guys. Come on, guys. How we looking, ladies? Good. Jessica and I, we jump on our first one. Yes, baby. Come on, girls! We bang it out just like that. Let's go. Go, go. Wow. Two claws, two knuckles, six legs, one perfect tail. Good job. Excellent. Awesome. Well done, great job. Come on. Oh, jeez. Two claws, two knuckles, one stunning tail. Great job. Yes! We're getting our ass kicked. Let's go, let's go. Come on, ladies, we're already up two-nothing, actually. Seriously?

Let's go. Behind. Behind. Come on, come on, come on. Ring that bell, let's go. One, two, three, four, five, six legs, one perfect. All right, come on, grab another one. Let's go, guys. Two to one. Good job. Great job. I'm hearing these dings, man. Five, six, perfect. Good job. And me and Jeremy don't even have one out yet. I'm struggling right now. It's stuck, it's stuck. Redo, redo. Man, are you serious? I'm like, we gotta get something in the window. Jeremy and Jon! Yes, chef? What are you doing? We're going fast, chef. We're going as fast as we can. Come on! Three, four, five, six. One stunning tail. Great job. We start hearing the bells ring on the blue side. Well done. Perfect. Good job. We like, oh, . We better catch up. Good job. Two, two, two, two.

As your reward, you are gonna have the most amazing day on a 85-foot luxury yacht. Oh, my God! I'm ready. I have a very special treat for you. Katsuya, the incredible sushi master, will be sending over his finest creations for lunch. After that, I've arranged for all of you to have the most amazing massage. Getting body massages and sipping champagne and on yachts. I want a massage. I need a massage. My back hurt. Ladies, off you go. Well done. Rock it out! That's three in a row. Three in a row. Good job, girls. Jon and Jeremy. One lobster, ten minutes. Way to go. Way to help the team out. Good job. Men, you are in for a horrific day. Today is fish delivery day in Hell's Kitchen. You're gonna be preparing hundreds of pounds of fresh halibut and branzino. Each fish needs to be gutted, de-finned, scaled, portioned. Got it? Yes, chef. Double time, double time. We're gonna be getting intimate with this fish. Gross. Scaling fish, gutting gish, portioning fish. Oh, it stinks like a ! I smell like I just got in a Greco-Roman wrestling match with shamu, and I didn't win. Man, I hate you, fish. While the men dig into their punishment... Oh, it stinks. The women... Are digging their reward. It's going down on the yacht today, baby. Oh, my gosh. The yacht is massive, it's gorgeous. Total VIP. It's just beautiful. What was going through your mind being woken up that early this morning? I was nervous, chef. My hoo-has was all over the place. I had no brassiere on. Who was all over the place? My hoo-has. Hoo-has? What are they? Susie. Annie. You've named your breasts? Susie, Annie, meet chef. Sitting there having conversations with chef Ramsay is absolutely incredible. Teamwork is all about understanding each other. As the orders come on, don't get confused with what's being called out. Two or three of you run to the window. Come up and find out. He has such great advice for us, and he's really funny. Will you promise me one thing? Yes, chef. Under no circumstances let Jean-Philippe get into his speedos. Please. Thank you, ladies. Enjoy. Thanks, chef. Cheers. Champagne with chef Gordon Ramsay. How awesome is that? Bye, chef! As the red team is going full steam ahead onto the high seas... back at Hell's Kitchen, the blue team... Oh, my God, I'm starving. Finally gets a break. Lunch is served. Oh, . What is that? Fish head soup. Oh, my. It's gonna be terrible. Salud! Oh, my God. Ugh. That was not good by any means. What the...? What the hell is fish head soup? Who eats that? Oh, every time it hits me with the smell, I'm gonna just upchuck. Ugh. The worst part is if I threw up, it would look just like this. Do you like your sushi? My favorite. It's so fresh. This is so... that is... that is really good. We're on the California coast, the most gorgeous day we could ever ask for. Oh, my God, the air. Relaxing on a huge yacht with a massage waiting for me. It's unbelievable. The red team has complete momentum, and I don't think we're gonna stop anytime soon. With the much anticipated second dinner service only hours away, sous chef Andi... It's a serious day. Yes, chef. Okay. And sous chef James... You guys need to get this stuff done today. Are pushing for a productive day of prep. Let's do it. And with dinner service fast approaching... Fifth gear, fifth gear, fifth gear. How you feeling, girls? Good? Good. Good? Things are moving smoothly in the red kitchen. You all right over here? Or maybe not. What the happened to these ones? This look like t-Rex chewed on it. Danielle... You know how expensive lamb is? I don't even know what chef's gonna say about this . This bitch done up three racks of lamb. How the hell you do that? This meat is sexy. You gotta finesse the meat. You gotta make love to the meat. Right now you butchering the meat. Mm-mm. You up already. Why? If it come down to it, I'ma probably throw Danielle under the bus and drive her over a couple times if she don't get her together. If chef... if chef see that , he is gonna cuss our asses out. While Danielle's lamb is a total loss, over in the blue kitchen, one chef... Jeremy. Is just lost. You're walking around here with your head up your . Jeremy, he's moving in first and second gear all the time. And I really need him to pick it up. Then get it clean, man. Let's get it... let's get it moving. Unbelievable. Uh, blue team. We're opening in 30 minutes. Get a grip. So we need to hurry our ass, tidy up our stations. It's time to move, like, we gotta go. I'm just waiting for the chef to come back, so I can do the mushrooms. So they're not done. Do you see what I'm doing? That was, like... that was, like, a half hour ago though. I don't want nobody to this up tonight. I have somebody come over in my ear saying, "Hey, weren't you supposed to do this?" I'm like, "Shut up. I'm doing it." It's been clean for 25 minutes. I'm doing everything else. Shut the up. Focus on your . Dinner service may be 30 minutes away, but already tension is running high on the blue team. I'm doing everything else that everybody else is calling out. Focus on your . Uh, guys, we don't have time to be talking about here. Let's just get this done. Finish what you were doing before you start working on something else. That's all I'm saying. Yeah. We just gotta get it done. I'm gonna show my team that I'm here to stay because I'm just gonna... I'm gonna bust it, I'm a hustle. Zach, be advised, dude. I'm gonna grab some water and get it set for the polenta. I'm with you, chef. And hopefully I'll do better. I'm right here, guys, I'm right here. Ladies, come over, please. Yes, chef. Let's go. Let's go, guys. Line up, please. Let's go. Okay. Tonight I am expecting a much better service from the blue team, let me tell you. Yes, chef. Ladies, show me our opening night in Hell's Kitchen, and your performance especially, wasn't a fluke. Yes, chef. Good. Bottom line for all of you, I really should see some great teamwork. Yes, chef. Let's go. Jean-Philippe, open Hell's Kitchen, please. Let's go. Swelling gone down? It's gonna be all right. It's hurting, but we're gonna do it. Guests are arriving. All right, are you feeling good? Yes. We're gonna do good. Once again, Hell's Kitchen is the place to be in Los Angeles. Tonight, in addition to chef Ramsay's classic dishes... What can I get for the young lady? I'll have the lobster risotto. We're gonna start off with the pan-seared scallops. He will also be offering... The lobster special, please. Lobster special. Served tableside by Nedra in the red kitchen and Jeremy in the blue. How long we steaming the lobsters for? Six minutes, chef. Six minutes? Good. As the first orders are hitting the kitchens... Let's go. The pressure is now on Mary and Danielle on appetizers to get the red kitchen off to a good start. Ladies, here we go. On order, four covers, table 32. Three risotto, one scallops. One lobster special, one bass, two halibut. Yes, chef. I need two-minute warning on scallops. We need seven minutes for the risotto because there's three of them. I'm a butcher, but I can cook circles around anybody. And so I'm ready to get in there and show chef Ramsay that I definitely know my flavors. Walking to the pass with the risotto. Scallops? Coming right up, chef. Risotto's right here. Behind you. How is it? What is that? muppet. All of you! All of you! All of you! Yes, chef? Taste that! Hurry up! Jessica! Yes, chef? I haven't got time to piss around. Coming through, coming through. I mean, what's the first thing you taste? White wine, chef. Come on, Mary. Get it together! That's basic . How much wine did you put in there? No, I put in just a few squirts, chef. So you have to reduce it down. Yes, chef, yes, chef. Get a pan on, start the risotto. Come on! Yes, chef. Just not hot enough yet. Just give me about ten seconds here. In Hell's Kitchen, it's about it being 100% spot-on, no mistakes, no -ups, exactly how it's supposed to be. Let's get it going. Let's go, let's go. Just give me about ten seconds. While Danielle takes ownership of Mary's risotto, over in the blue kitchen... Scallops, are they ready? Christian... Done. Bring them then! And Zach... Three risotto! Where are they? Working now, chef, in the pan. Are ready to impress with their first set of appetizers. All this, go, that's three. Taste that . Don't just push it, all right? Scallops were never cooked. Rubber scallops! Rubber scallops! You having a drink? You all right? Little bit of lemon in there? Hey. Hey, you , come here. We're in the . No, not a good start. This is embarrassing. Start again! Three risotto, one scallops. Yes, chef! Both kitchens... All right, let's go, gentlemen. Are off to a shaky start. We're gonna get through this, ladies. We're gonna get through it. Don't worry. But with specials on order... Lobster out, let's go! Chef Ramsay sends Nedra and Jeremy out to the dining room to retrieve the necessary lobsters. For this table, is, uh, Jalen Rose. He's a massive NBA player, okay? Yeah, and which one is that one? The guy in the suit? So please schmooze, schmooze, schmooze. Yes. Schmooze, schmooze. What type of lobster would you like tonight? I want a big one. You want a big one. Where's Jeremy? It's okay, it's okay. Are you serious? I don't know how long this is gonna take. Oh, no, you don't. You're not going anywhere. What's he doing? While Jeremy tries to figure out where to go next... Was it that table? That table? In the blue kitchen... Three risotto, one scallops. How long? Four or five minutes long, tops. Well, look, his scallops are cooked! Christian... I didn't tell you to fire the scallops. Has jumped the gun. Yes, guys. Sorry, guys. We've been open for 57 minutes. There's nothing coming out. And I don't know what the hell is going on. I don't know where the teamwork's disappearing. Christian, one portion of scallops urgently. Yes, chef. I'm always confident in the kitchen. Knowing that I'm backing up the kitchen is killing me in the inside. Coming to the pass. Chef... risotto right behind you, chef. Scallops! Dude, you gotta sear and flip 'em. Scallops! I am flipping 'em, guys. I told you I'm having a hard time. I apologize. Stop apologizing and just fix it. Do something! They're not done. I'd rather die, guys, instead of serving raw scallops on you. I must have made scallops a million times. Scallops, please! I can't believe I'm doing this right now. They're not done. What? Oh, . No, no, no. This is a joke. There's just nothing coming out. We are struggling. Christian! Stop me around! It's one hour into dinner service, and almost no food has left the kitchen. It's taking a long time, huh? Yeah. Chef... risotto right behind you, chef. But all the blue team needs to complete its first order of appetizers is... Scallops, please! They're not done. What? This is a joke. There's just nothing coming out. We are struggling. Come on! Where's your energy? Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. The men have finally sent out their first appetizers. Come on, guys, keep it up. And the guests... So good. I'm enjoying it. Are impressed. Meanwhile in the red kitchen... How long? Danielle is finally ready with her risotto. Walking on three... three risotto. And the red team is hoping their appetizers are up to chef Ramsay's standards. Did you taste it? Yes, we tasted it. Yes. Come on, Danielle. You gotta know your . You gotta be on it. It's not my job to taste everything that you're doing. I'm walking on scallops. Let's go with the risotto already! Okay, right behind you. Hot. I'm ready with the risotto. Too much white wine in there again. All of you. Oh, my God. Taste that. Hurry up. Taste. I think that tastes good. I think it needs salt. No one can't taste the white wine in there again? Have you got a drinking problem? No, chef. The first thing you can taste in there is white wine. Yes, chef. So you want about a tablespoon? You have to burn off the alcohol. Yes, chef. I'm great at what I do, but this is hard. I mean, this is harder than hard. Someone, teach these two idiots how to make a risotto! Yes, chef! Mary, are you watching what I'm dong? While Ja'nel schools Mary and Danielle in how to make a proper risotto, back in the blue kitchen... Two capellini, two scallops. How long? The men... Two minutes! One order. One order? One order right now. Are looking to Christian to deliver on scallops once more. Let's go then! Christian, anything else you guys need? Anything else I can help with? I'm fine. Okay. My responsibility is to help out Christian as much as I can. Are you guys okay? Yep. Come on, buddy. I'm asking you if you want my help and y-you deny me.

A glass of wine, please, for the two chefs. It was... it was his scallops. I didn't even have anything to do with them. Enjoy. You. Hey, get a grip. Scallops urgently. Heard, chef.

Wow, did I get my reamed. I promise you, you don't wanna be here. You don't wanna be here. And you know what? Right now we need to figure out what the went wrong with this .

I can't wait to redeem myself for the royal screw-up that I did with my signature dish and the raw lamb. I'm courageous. I say, "Bring it on." I know I can cook the out of this lamb. Ja'nel, I'm gonna need your help. Okay. I need to cut this meat. You got it. Nice and quick. Come on, girlie. Faster. It's hot. Come on, Susan, trust your gut. You know what it should look like. Lamb! Coming, chef! Yes, chef. That's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good. I'm behind you with sauce. Garnish! Chef, garnish for lamb. Walking with Wellington. Coming up. Bass is ready. Two Wellington, one lamb. Walking with the entrees. Behind you. That's raw. That's raw. Ah, me. Nedra, come here! Hurry up! Yes, chef? All of you! All of you! Yes, chef. Oh, my gosh. What the is that? It's raw, chef. Who sent me raw lamb on the signature dish? Who was that? Me...Chef. It's a joke for you, isn't it? Not a joke at all, chef. So what's that then? It's raw lamb. All of you, get out. Get out! I'm done! Get out! This sucks. Leave it. Like, we're all talented. We're all good at what we do. Leave it! It shouldn't be that hard. Get out! I was actually expecting tonight to be a-a good service. But both kitchens were a disaster. Tonight there's no such thing as a winning team. I had two pathetic, embarrassing brigades. And so I want each team to do something that they haven't done all night. Communicate. And come up with two individuals on the blue team and two individuals on the red team that you think should leave Hell's Kitchen. Got it? Yes, chef. Piss off. Pathetic. I'm real pissed at my team. I can't put up with too much of that . I blame everybody for tonight's disaster. Biggest question on my mind is, who's the next I'm getting out of here? Let's get to business. We gotta put up two people. Just vote. Christian. All right, one for Christian. Christian. Barret? I would say Christian because he needed the most help. I mean, he froze up. I won't lie that I froze up, guys. But listen, I-I fight for myself. I will get better and do better. You have to accept when you make mistakes. If I stay here and get a second chance, I'll step up, and I'll show chef Ramsay I'm here to win. I'm going with Jeremy. Because when we were prepping, he didn't have a second, third, or fourth gear. I'm sorry to say it, but you didn't take any initiative. I agree with Mike. Jeremy, who's the last person to get downstairs? Who's the last person to get anything, dude? You're always the last one. Anthony gets down before you. You've got a up foot. There's not enough hustle. What more did you guys want me to do? I don't belong in front of Ramsay. I asked every single station if they needed my help. Did you even watch me on my service? I lifted the whole team off a wall. Come on. What us up was appetizers. It was appetizers. The apps were definitely the weakest. Mary and Danielle clearly held us back. Once I got a handle on what I was doing, I freakin' fought back. And none of my other dishes came back once I got the handle on it. Mary, I appreciate you owning it. And, Danielle, I don't hear you fighting for it. If you wanna be here, tell us what you think. There were problems in everybody's station. The lamb came back undercooked. Because of the appetizer situation. I would have had s... like, extra time on the lamb to know that it was rare. I don't think that's fair to say. Raw is raw. If you know raw, you know raw. If you don't, you don't. I am so pissed. No, I don't wanna talk anymore. I'm done. I'm not going home for lamb. W-what's our decision? Let's go. I'm done. Honestly, if that's what sends me home, then that's ridiculous. Susan, why are you getting upset? No, I'm done. I don't wanna talk anymore. Susan. Susan! Susan! Okay, Jon. Yes, chef. Blue team's first nominee and why. Chef, our first nominee tonight is Jeremy. He walks slow. He just doesn't seem to have the fire. I helped my whole team get over a wall by myself, chef. I don't know how much more fire they want from me. Second nominee and why. Chef, our second nominee is Christian. We feel like that was one of the biggest failing stations tonight. And there just seems to be no sense of urgency. Ja'nel, red team's first nominee and why. Our first nominee... Is Danielle. Because even though we were struggling and having a hard time, there wasn't much fight there. Second nominee and why. We also nominated... After a dinner service so disastrous that every chef was kicked out of the kitchen, both teams have been asked to nominate two chefs for elimination. The women's first nominee was... Danielle. Second nominee and why. We also nominated... Mary. She was struggling as well. Okay. Danielle, Mary, Jeremy, Christian, step forward. Mary, why should you stay in Hell's Kitchen? I made a lot of mistakes tonight, and I realize that, but I fought back, chef. I fought back. Danielle, still lacking in confidence. Is it complicated here? It's just a lot to grasp. A lot to grasp? You get stressed before we even turn the gas on. Jeremy. I know my stations. I understand them. Chef, to be honest, I haven't even had a chance to really cook yet. Can you get any better? Of course, chef. I can always get better. Christian. I think I brought the whole team down, but I have a lot more in me. I have the heart, chef. I'm willing to learn and try my ass off for you, chef. Okay. My decision is... Danielle. Jeremy. Back in line, both of you. You're kidding. Mary. How much wine did you put in there? I put in just a few squirts, chef. So you have to reduce it down! Christian. Christian! Yes, chef. He brings up scallops. rubber. The person leaving Hell's Kitchen... ♪ Christian. Give me your jacket, big boy. Your time is done. Hey, I'm a Boston guy. I had my bill Buckner moment. I froze at a big time, but I didn't get my second chance to fight, which really pissed me off. Chef Ramsay made a big mistake by getting rid of this Boston guy. Hell's Kitchen is all about fighting back. Got it? Yes, chef! Get out of here. Jeremy. Stay there. What the is going on? We're down two people. We can't lose anyone else. Chef Ramsay calls out Jeremy, and I'm like, who cares? I'm ready for him to go home. Come here, you. Next time on Hell's Kitchen... Wake up! Hurry up, you dimwit, Mary! All hell breaks loose. It's not good enough! And one chef heads for the hills. Where is Mary? No one knows where she is or if she's coming back. She is screwing us royally right now. In the men's kitchen... Where is it? A simple question... You just looked at the lamb. How... Move. Leads to a fight... yelling at me. Of epic proportions. bump into me again. Don't bump me. You ain't . You wanna fight? Come get it! Get the out of here. ! Next time on a law-breaking... I don't care if I go to jail tonight. What the ? Door-slamming... What? Get the out and go home! Hell's Kitchen.
