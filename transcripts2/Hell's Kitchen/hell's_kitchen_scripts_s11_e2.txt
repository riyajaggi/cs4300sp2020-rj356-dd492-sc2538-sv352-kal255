 Thank you, chef. While Sebastian... That is disgusting. Danielle... What happened in that kitchen should have stayed in that kitchen. Gina... Did you pick this up at the buffet? And Dan... Did you throw up on that plate? Made a different kind of impression. Zach and Jacqueline, let's go, guys. It all came down to the final two dishes. This is really close. Congratulations, ladies. Great job. Yes! We the winner! We the winner! We were the winner tonight. Whoo! The victorious women... To the best! Received the royal treatment at Caesar's Palace. I cannot believe we met Celine Dion. While the men slummed it back to Los Angeles... Hot in here, man. On an uncomfortable... I think one of the reasons that they really beat the out of us today... And monotonous... I want to throw Sebastian right out the window. He just talks too much. 8 1/2-hour ride on a school bus. We really got to focus on trying to... Oh, my God. Sebastian, time out. After returning from Vegas, the women settled into their Hell's Kitchen dorms... So cool! This is... And discovered there is another chef on their team. What's the matter with you? We got to study. It's a nice-a place. Bitch, who brings a puppet in Hell's Kitchen? On the first day in the kitchen... Let's start working. The men are determined to bounce back from defeat. Behind, behind behind. Dinner service coming up, we got to come out swinging 'cause we're not taking another one to the chin like that. But on the women's side, Gina is struck with a mysterious illness. I can't function. Are we operating without Gina? Medic! Find out right now if she's out of the competition... Do you need to go to the emergency room? Tonight on Hell's Kitchen. Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com And now, the continuation of Hell's Kitchen. The doors have not yet opened for dinner service. Gina, what's going on? Um, I can't function. And Gina is already feeling the pressure. I'm sorry that I'm doing this, but... No, let's go. Let's go back here. Sit down right here. Medic! Medic! Can you tell me your name? Do you know where you are right now? I was, like, standing in line, and I was getting overwhelmed. Okay. Are you feeling okay right now? Yeah. Like, my mind's wandering about all stuff right now. I need just to relax my system. You're not dizzy or anything? No, I just don't want to be in a kitchen. Let's go, ladies. While the red team shucks, scrapes, and slices in preparation for the impending dinner service... Now we a man down. What are we gonna do? We gonna pull it together. Up in the dorms, Gina focuses on Gina. I need to be away from everything, away from all my teammates, and concentrate just on myself and get myself together. While the red team has lost a chef, in the blue kitchen... Did anybody see how he pre-heated up the potato puree? One chef is just lost. He's got the potato right here. He's got the leeks right here. It's ready to go. This is bass, so put bass. Working side-by-side with Jeremy, I'm gonna tell ya, I think his inexperience shines through. I'm just a little concerned right now. While Jeremy struggles to keep up in the blue kitchen, in the red kitchen... How we feeling? Good! The women are moving full speed ahead, despite being down a chef. Are we gonna win tonight? Yeah! I definitely think that without Gina here, we are a stronger team. You good, baby? I'm good, mama. We don't have that dead weight dragging us down. Let's go ladies. I just needed a rest. And I'm gonna bounce back really fast. All right, Jacqueline, so what did I miss? What'd you miss? You missed everything. All right, ladies. Let's go. Yes, chef. Guys, line up. Let's go. Quickly. We are opening Hell's Kitchen for the 11th time. Whoo! Oh, yes. It's a big one. Let's do it. Let's be honest. I'm not looking for perfection. Let's get that right. But I am expecting each and every one of you to give your best, and for every customer to be fed. So I'm guaranteeing a complete dinner service. How's that sound? Yes, chef. Guaranteed. Oh, my God. This is our first night of Hell's Kitchen. That's not an easy thing to do. We will stop at nothing to complete a service. Sorry, chef. Oh, come on, J.P. John Philippe! Oh, my God, J.P.? Where has he been for three years? I told you to be here yesterday. Got delayed. I really tried to be on time. Get changed, J.P. I'm pissed off. Honestly? Unreal. Okay, get on your stations. Let's go, guys. Open Hell's Kitchen. Yes, chef. Let's go, guys. Come on, let's go. Tonight is the grand re-opening of Hell's Kitchen. The beef Wellington. I'll have the halibut. And in addition to his classic menu, chef Ramsay has added a tableside appetizer of ale-steamed mussels, which will be served by Amanda in the red section of the dining room and by Christian in the blue section. And it's accurate. J.P. Yeah? I need the tickets. Yes, chef. You know, you disappear for three years and then you turn up late. Sorry, chef. How rude. Okay, ladies. On order. First ticket in. Three couples, table 31. Two burrata, one scallops, one mussels. Yes, chef. Okay, do you have a spatula? Where's the ones I flip the scallops with? What? Where's the other ones? That's these ones. Crazy Gina. She doesn't know what she's doing. She hasn't been here all day. Now she wants to cook scallops. Really? Gina's in la-la land, flipping the scallops a million times. You know, it's a simple sear. One side, other side, that's it. Over and over, come on. Don't flip it back over. Don't flip it back over. You ready, scallops? Yes, ready. Okay. Lock it, girl. Lock it. God only knows what these scallops are going to be like. This is not the way the red kitchen wants to start. Who cooked the scallops? Here we go. We're already going to get laid into. Who cooked them? I did, chef. Ugh. Excellent. Thank you. These are the immaculate scallops. How does this happen? Good job, girl. To the shock of her teammates, Gina has delivered perfect scallops. Told you I can cook scallops. While in the blue kitchen, the men can't even deliver... On order, two risotto, one mussels, one scallops. A response. The correct response is, "Yes, chef." The blue team's response is... Guys! Yes, chef. Thank you. For all the appetizers to be delivered to the first table at the same time, Sebastian on appetizers in the kitchen must be in total synch with Christian in the dining room. Would you guys like that spicy or mild? A slight kick. Slight kick. Let's start rocking the little pan. I've worked in different restaurants. I know how to make risotto, but, like, I've never really focused much on cooking Italian food. I'm not putting it down. It's just, like, I'm Mexican, so I like those spices more. Sebastian, how long? Walking it now! Thank you. There you go. Scallops walking through. Scallops just walked. Thank you. Scallops walking by to pass. Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me, chef. Behind you, chef. Hot. That's raw. All of you, come here quick. And I mean quick. Spoon, taste. Oh, my God. Here we go. Please, no. Our first ticket. Undercooked. These are... yeah. Regroup and get it together. Yes, chef. Gonna get it together, chef. Gonna get it together. Zach, the scallops were cooked beautifully. Thank you, chef. I don't know what to do. My mussels are ready, so I said, it. Put them right in front here. Enjoy, guy. I'm really pissed right now. I'm doing my part out there, and my team can't get the first table together. Oh, and by the way, the mussels are being served to the table. While Sebastian starts over on the risotto, Gina... Nedra, how long for the risotto? I need five minutes on risotto. Is anxious to prove her earlier success was no fluke. How long on that risotto, Nedra? Nedra? You almost done? Bitch, I just told you five minutes. I know how long it take to cook scallops. Scallops, how long? How long for that risotto? "How much longer? How much longer?" Shut up, Gina. Nedra? Nedra won't tell me anything. Scallops going in. So I'm whipping up the scallops. Scallops ready. Uh, no. No, no, no, no. I need two minutes on risotto. Two minutes. You crazy bitch. Why did you cook the scallops? Walking with risotto. Walking scallops. Right behind you, chef. Hot. All of you, come here. Let me show you a little waterfall. Oh, my gosh. Just touch them. Cold, overcooked. Switch up scallops, guys. Mary, do you want to do scallops? No, I want to do scallops. Somebody else has got to do risotto. What do you mean? Oh, hell no. Gina, don't throw me under the bus because your ain't right. How long on scallops? Nedra, just off. You got some good color on there. Don't burn it. This bitch couldn't cook a scallop to save her life. And I know that chef is about to find out. I got the scallops ready. Go, Gina. You got to go. Walking scallops, chef. Mm-hmm. Good luck to you, Gina. Risotto right behind you, chef. Hot. Ah. All of you, come here. I guaranteed a complete service tonight. You can't even hold it together for the second ticket. Get out, Gina. Nedra, the risotto was delicious. Thank you, chef. Let's go, ladies. A beep, beep whoo! Nedra. How many minutes? "Uh, five minutes." Okay, that was two minutes ago. I am so pissed. Those little bitches. They better watch out. There's gonna be war. It's opening night in Hell's Kitchen, and the red team... Get out, Gina. Once again finds themselves Gina-less in the kitchen. While on the blue side... Okay, risotto's ready, brother. Scallops walking up to the pass. The men are finally ready to impress chef Ramsay with their second attempt on the first order of appetizers. Come on, guys. Service, please. Here we go. Come on. Blue team is on a roll. Second ticket. Keep it rolling, guys. Three cappellini, one scallops, one mussels. How long? I need 60 seconds. We are finally gelling together as a team. Walking. Scallops walking up to the pass. Excuse me, chef. Taste that. How hot is that? All of you, taste that. It's too spicy, and it's disgusting. Trash. And again, scallops cooked beautifully. What the is going on? It's like deja vu in this . How many times have you cooked scallops tonight and not served them? Twice, chef. Sorry, bro. Sebastian, get it together! Yes, chef. Come on, guys. Let's go. Okay, Mikey-wikey. I messed up a few times, but I'm getting in with the groove, I'm playing around. Trying to make the environment a little bit looser. Zachy, talk to me. We got three halibut, one branzino. Zachy-wacky! Hey, you. Hey, come here, you. Zachy-wacky? Chef Zach! Hey, look at me. Hey, look. Is this a joke? No, chef. Zachy-wacky? Sorry. I apologize about that, chef. Yeah, do me a favor. Get out! Yes, chef. off, will you? Get out! Yes, chef. Upstairs! Get out! So Sebastian gets kicked out. We didn't see that coming. Zachy-wacky? What are you doing? Where the hell are you going, Sebastian? Okay, yeah, you can come back. Second time, get out! Gah, are you kidding me? off. Wacky! The blue team is now down a chef, and it's up to jon to handle the appetizer station solo. I need two minutes, please. While in the dining room... My blue team's backed up a little bit, so I'm gonna give you the mussels. Uh, okay. Christian is successfully serving mussels... Will I still get the risotto? Whether the diners ordered them or not. I just started going to the tables that had their food waiting for so long to try to help our blue team out. I apologize for the service of my team and hope you guys enjoy. Walking with risotto, guys. Meanwhile, with Gina gone, the red team is cranking out the appetizers. Go, please. Yeah, asparagus. Now it's up to Jessica and Cyndi on the meat station and Danielle and Susan on garnish to keep up the momentum. On order. Four couples, table 51. Entree one chicken, one short rib, pasta, two Wellington. Yes, chef. I don't understand how you're expected to remember all the tickets. Six couples, white table 30. Entree two halibut, one bass, one pork, one lamb, one Wellington. Yes, chef. You okay? I've never worked in a brigade before. Oh, really? Never. I cannot believe that Danielle is a head chef. A head chef of what? A hot dog stand? Three risotto, two burrata. Let's go. What are you reading that for, Danielle? I was trying to see if that was a ticket... just to see what you had just called. Where is your ticket that I've just called? Well, it's supposed to be here... And it is not there. Let's walk three steps together. Yes, chef. One, two, three, and it's there. Yes, chef. You're making such hard work out of nothing. I have no idea why Danielle can't get it together. I'm embarrassed for her. Three steps, first ticket, second ticket. Okay? Yes, chef. No off. Yes, thank you. While Danielle gets a lesson in Kitchen 101, on the blue side... My risotto's ready to walk, dude. Yeah, let's go. Jon, without the help of Sebastian... Good. Service, let's go. Has gotten the men back on track. Thank you, buddy. It looks really nice. And they are now ready to move on to entrees. Two lamb, two Wellington. Five minutes to the window. Yes, chef. Five minutes, in the window. I'm pretty excited about working meat tonight. I decided that I was going to do the lamb, and Barret has the Wellington. Wellington's in. I cook lamb every day. I mean, we run it for specials. I was even thinking about putting it on my next menu. Jeremy, 2 1/2 out on two lamb and two Wellington. Got it? Got it. I need to still cut it. You don't think that's still raw? Not once it rests, bro. All right. Ready to go? Put in the pass. I know my lamb's perfectly cooked, so I don't think we have anything to worry about. That's raw. Yeah, hey, come here. Come here. Oh, my God. That you want to re-fire, chef. You've got to be kidding me, man. Like, suddenly I don't know how to cook. Firing another Wellington. While the blue kitchen waits for a do-over on Michael's lamb, over in the red kitchen... Keep it going. You had two Wellington, one lamb. How long? Six minutes, chef. Let's go. Chef Ramsay is looking for Cyndi and Jessica to deliver on the meat station. You putting your lamb back in? No. You've got to brown off the crust and then we got to let it rest before we slice it. Oh, you're right. Jessica's fresh out of culinary school, so this could be a disaster. Lamb! Lamb, slicing. It's ready to go. She basically just has to slice and walk. ! This is not rocket science. Seriously, slice the lamb. How long does it really take? How much of an amateur are you? Where's the lamb? Just cut through it, babe. Cut through it. I'm trying. Oh, my God, this bitch is cutting lamb for 6 hours now. Bitch, there's only 24 hours in a day. I want that lamb now. Right behind. Right behind. Lamb rising. Lamb, chef. Oh, mother. Who cooked the lamb? Me, chef. Perfect. Thank you, chef. Who would have thought? Girl can cook some meat. Chicken walking. While the red team pushes out entrees... Service, let's go. Looks great. Ank you so much. Over in the blue kitchen... Garnish, two lamb, two Wellington. Barret's re-fire Wellingtons... We're good. We're good. Are perfectly cooked, but Michael's lamb... Guys, I'm not sending it out under. Could use a little more time. I got to go with these. Don't go up there yet, bro. The lamb is not ready. Michael's lamb is not ready. Come on, guys. I'm waiting on the lamb, chef. I'm sorry. You're waiting on the lamb? (Michael yeah. I was waiting for the lamb, waiting for the lamb, waiting for the lamb. It's, like, medium. It's not medium rare anymore. You need to go. Yeah, hold on, hold on. Wait for me. Can't rest no more. We got to go. Guys, walking two Wellington. me, man. Barret, thanks for that, buddy. That's . I just can't believe this is happening right now. Lamb! Come on, Michael, a bit of energy. Yes, chef. Terrible. Embarrassing. Oh, God. It's coming back. Time out. Stop! The bone thicker than the meat. There needs to be meat on there. This is not a dog's chew toy. This is lamb. And if that's not bad enough... They're way overcooked. Horrible. . Michael and Barret, dumb and dumber. You don't slice the Wellington until the lamb's ready. Yes, chef. And when it's together like... Oh, you. Chef, can I please come back, chef? Dude, really, what are you doing? Perfect timing. You. You come here, you. You're making me look stupid. No, chef. The blue team, one hour into service and not one entree out. You, for the last time, take him and him... And get out! It's just over an hour into Hell's Kitchen's opening night, and the blue team has failed to deliver a single entree to the dining room. How much longer could it be? And the unwelcome return of Sebastian... Chef, can I please come back, chef? You. You come here, you. Has pushed chef Ramsay to the limit. You, for the last time, take him and him and get out! And let me tell you something. You come back downstairs again, you'll be leaving through the front door. Now get out! Yes, chef. Three of you. You, on meat. Yes, chef. You, on meat. Yes, chef. Hey, get out! Now I'm pissed off. I didn't do anything to get kicked out of this dinner service. Chef Ramsay looks to Ray and Anthony to step up and rescue the meat. They're already cut. Close 'em up. But over in the red kitchen... Where is the kale? He's looking for something else. Kale? Yes, chef. Black kale for the lamb... Look at you both staring. You're not even answering me, Danielle. Danielle, get it together. She's cooked the lamb perfectly and garnish. Where's the kale? . Come on, Danielle! I'm trying. I've never done this before. I need the kale. Protein's nailed perfectly. We're missing the kale. Danielle! It absolutely will be one minute. Yes, chef. Yes, chef. Just lightly, lightly, lightly tossed. Danielle's all over the place. She doesn't know what she's doing. Like that? More along this color. I'm spending more time babysitting Danielle than I am worrying about my own garnish. Behind. Finally. Ladies! Touch them. All right, chef. Oh, my God. That's my garnish. Who cooked them? I did, chef. Yeah. You, get out. Get out! Hey, madam. You think it's funny? No, no, no. Take your with you. I know that this is not funny. I don't deserve to be kicked out of the kitchen... Danielle does. She was the one bringing the station down. Danielle, don't stop the re-do. Hurry up. After that, two chicken, two Wellington. Two chicken, two Wellington. Yes, chef. Sorry, chef. I'm confused. Do you need the one for the re-do and the two chicken and two Wellington? Or do you just need the two chicken and two Wellington? Get out! Get out! It's just really hard. And it's a lot harder than people know. While the women look for someone to step up on the garnish station... Let's go. Someone help. We've got to get this chicken garnish going. Chef Ramsay... Blue team, let's go. Pushes the men to keep the entrees coming. Walking, chef. Two lamb, chef. Service, please. Mm. Cooked perfectly. Keep it rolling, guys. Three halibut, one bass, one chicken. Come on, guys. Yes, chef. I'm looking at Jeremy sauteing off kale. I can see the kale literally catching fire, getting burnt. Chef, turn that down some, chef. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, don't even serve that. I'm not. Worry about your side. Let me do my side, yeah? What? Hey, no territory . It's my station and I don't need his help. So shut up and do what you're supposed to be doing. Un...believable. Here we go with three halibut, one bass, one chicken. Yes, chef. Seven minutes to the window. What we going with? Two... uh, two halibuts and one chicken, chef. Three halibuts. Three halibut and one chicken, chef. Three halibut, one bass, one chicken. What we going with? Three halibut, uh... Jeremy, he's telling it to you. Just say it right back, man. I'm pretty sure birds can do that. Three halibuts, one bass, one chicken. What's going? The three halibut, two... two, uh. Two... two. Get out! Bye-bye, Jeremy. It's 90 minutes into opening night. Mary. Yes, chef? Garnish. And with three members of the red team already kicked out of the kitchen... I've never worked in a brigade before. The rest of the team is struggling to fill the vacancies... Send it without potatoes. Forcing chef Ramsay to take the unusual measure of sending the entree without the garnish, in hopes he will catch up on the order before the diner notices. Go, please. We'll send the potatoes separate. Right, potatoes, we're dragging, with chorizo, urgently. Yes, chef. I'm swamped right now. A few of the girls got kicked out, and now I'm on fish. And on top of that, now I'm on the garnish station. Oh, my God. Anybody gonna help her? Jacqueline, don't stand there staring. There's always something to do. Yes, chef. Chef Ramsay doesn't stress me out. I'm just like, "relax. Channel the inner zen." Guys, I need to get my bass in. Watch out. I'm looking at Jacqueline. She not doing a damn thing right now. I need water. Uh, madam? Yeah, it needs garnish. You're absolutely right. My apologies. Give me two minutes. So now the customer's at the window. Seven minutes ago, we served the chicken and where are the potatoes? Coming, chef. 30 seconds. What are you doing? I had to get my water, chef. Get out. All right. Get out! Chef Ramsay told me to get out, and I'm like, "All right. I'm going to go upstairs and rehydrate myself." Mary! Garnish. Coming, chef. Thanks to Mary, the red team finally delivers the missing potatoes. Hot pan, chef. But in the blue kitchen... The chicken is going first. Chef Ramsay finds himself asking a familiar question. Where's the chicken garnish? Walking. Garnish the chicken. And what about the risotto appetizer? Yeah, 45 seconds. They need to be more cooked. Dan, come here. Just touch that. Hard, chef. Dan, please, come on. We, like, five people down in the kitchen. I need you, baby. I know that. We are going to complete dinner service, no matter what. Two risotto going up. Two risotto. Oh, man. Look at that, there. Stuck to the bottom of the pan. , man. Jon, take Dan and yourself and get the out of here. When somebody gets kicked out of the kitchen, it put more pressure on the next man. Whew. Raymond, taste that. Fingers. Spoons are everywhere. Bland, chef. Ray, you just stuck your finger into a risotto in front of chef Ramsay in Hell's Kitchen. That's just stupid. You may be the oldest, but out of respect, off. Yes, chef. You got to be . Blue kitchen tonight is like being in the middle of a natural disaster. My heart is beating. I'm not feeling good right now. It's getting hot. I start feeling pressure. You good? You good? I got to just breathe, Holmes. Risotto? Risotto, chef. Just taste that. Yeah, . Get out, get out. Another person gets kicked out. That's, like, another blow to me. I started to feel something in my stomach. I literally feel my body shutting down. W-where's Zach? Oh, my God. Zach keeps leaving the kitchen. All I'm thinking to myself is, "Don't go under. Don't go under." Zach. Zach! It's two hours into the grand re-opening of Hell's Kitchen, and in the blue kitchen, Zach is the last man standing... ...Barely. I'm feeling dehydrated. It's getting hot. And I'm starting to lose consciousness. Oh, my God. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Where's Zach? Zach! Zach! What are you doing? I'm throwing up for a minute. Let me just get this out, please. Throwing up. Throwing up. Oh, me. Oh, God. I'm literally telling myself, "If you think that, you know, "you going to pass out, guess what. Think again." Zach. Zach. You okay? Yes, chef. I'm a monster. First up, two bass, two halibut. Yeah, I'm finishing that up. I got it, chef. Chef Zach! Chef Zach! Bass, Zach? Hot. Two bass, chef. Two bass. Go, please. As Zach rises from the ashes... Whoo! Let's do it. Frustration is rising amongst the 12 ousted chefs. I got kicked out of the kitchen 'cause I couldn't repeat back the order. You got to repeat back the order. You got to be able to know that , man. Dude, communication's crumbling. It's the first of many. I've been cooking for half my life, okay? I've never worked in a brigade before. There's hardly any restaurants that work that way. Danielle is making sure everybody knows she hasn't worked in a brigade system before. Guess what? We know! We know this already. None of us have ever worked in this kitchen before. Curiosity, show of hands. Guys, how many people have worked in a true brigade before? While Danielle continues to ponder the mystery of the brigade system, downstairs, the red team has finally found their rhythm. Chicken walking. Garnish, chef. Let's go. And on the other side, Zach is feeling better and entrees are flying out of the blue kitchen as well. Mmm. That looks good. Last ticket, two halibut, two chicken. Yes, chef. I'm determined to finish service because what don't kill you only make you stronger. I literally threw ice on my chest. Touch this. Ice. Either that or die on the line. Last table, girls, last table. Ready, girls? I'm walking. Coming right behind you. The asparagus salad, chef. Service, please. I'm feeling really good right now. We completed the first dinner service. This is unbelievable. There you are, chef. Two halibut, two chicken. Perfect. Go, please. I knocked that out the park. Last man standing. Chef Zach is the man tonight. Tonight I guaranteed that we would complete a dinner service, but I expected all of you to be here when I finished. It was a difficult evening, but I will choose a winning team. The red team. Congratulations. Good job, baby, good job. Zach, you gave it your all. Yes, chef. That's the kind of commitment I want to see each and every service, all of you. It's going to get harder. Blue team, time to do something that you couldn't do tonight. I'd like each and every one of you now to work as a team and decide which two chefs you'd like to nominate to get the out of here tonight. Now off. Yes, chef. My team, they let me down. But I guarantee you the guilty parties will be penalized to the utmost. The two stations that dropped their ball was Sebastian's station and Michael on meats. As far as Michael, I agree. I did the Wellington because he said he was ready with the lamb. Michael was a disaster. He's an executive chef. He's been doing it for a while. Michael, you should know better. What's the matter with you? I know I up lamb, but at the same time, I've cooked thousands of racks of lamb in my life, and I have a lot of experience to bring to the table. Now with that being said, I'm going to go with Sebastian. I mean, you got to know when to be serious and put your head down. You know what I mean? And, you know, you got to know when to joke around. Sebastian really needs to hit the bricks. This guy is a clown. I haven't seen him serious for a second since he's been here. I like to have a good time at work, man. I do, too. I like to make jokes. I like to have a good time, but when it's in the kitchen, man, you've got to crunch. You came in three times and then I got kicked out... Yeah, what the were you thinking, man? Coming back in three times? There was only a second time. No, you came back a third time. It's very easy to point fingers. Tonight, we all screwed up. What pisses me off is I wasn't playing around. I was actually trying to put out some good food. Me, I got to nominate jer. Not because he's not a good cook, but, like, he's not the strongest guy on the team. I have to second on Jeremy. Not 'cause I don't like you, cuz. But, like, what happens tomorrow when we get in service? You guys know you're voting on me not because I can't cook, but because I couldn't repeat back an order? Chef, can I tell you why I will vote for you? Why? When I see the Greens literally turning brown... But I told you I got it. When you talk to me in that tone of voice and with that you got it... I'm not. Worry about your side. Let me do my side, yeah? 'Cause you were yelling at me. I'm yelling it right back at you. I did not yell at you. Jeremy reminds me of a young punk with a lot of mouth and nothing to back it up. You're taking me out because of what I said, but can I cook? No, you can't cook. You ain't doing it good, playboy. I'm not doing it good? You ain't doing it good. I'm 22. I got a lead position. Watch for me. I'm gonna step on you when I'm bigger. Watch, when I'm something and you ain't nothing. Holmes... 'Cause you stepping on me real hard, bro. None of us are right now. No, he just stepped on me real hard! You don't even know where the I'm from! Chef Ramsay has asked the blue team for two nominees, and Michael and Sebastian have been singled out. But another candidate has emerged. You ain't doing it good, playboy. I'm not doing it good? You ain't doing it good. You stepping on me real hard, bro. None of us are right now. No, he just stepped on me real hard! You don't even know where the I'm from! Imagine how I feel as a chef knowing I see you doing it wrong and I don't say nothing. What do that make me look like? I know it's you cooking the dish, but what the do that make me look like? Quit insulting people before you try their food. If you feel like that, chef, then why didn't you say, "Chef, come and taste it." I asked, I asked. I asked everybody to come try it. Did he ask any of you? Zach just threw me underneath a bus. But I'm not going to go down easy. I'm getting that stupid restaurant in Vegas, and I'll be better than everybody else, and they'll know it. How you gonna step on someone's career like that, dude? You stepped on your career. You just said my career ain't . You said, "Everybody off my station." You did it to yourself, "B". The nerve of this guy. 'Cause he knows what the he's doing. Clearly you don't got it. Duh. You out of here, Holmes. Men, have you reached a decision? Yes, chef. Did you work as a team? Yes, chef. Thank God for that. Zach, who is the blue team's first nominee and why? We have nominated Jeremy, because we saw something that wasn't going right with one of the dishes that he was doing, and he refused to take the criticism, telling us to get off his station and he got it. The mistake of the cooking is one thing, but then the arrogance to not want it to be corrected is something totally different. We can't have that kind of attitude in our kitchen going on. I'm not asking you to kiss each other's ass, but when you walk into that blue kitchen, you work as a team. Jeremy, were you arrogant? Is Zach right? No, it wasn't that I was arrogant, chef. I was frustrated at the situation, chef, and I lashed out. Frustrated and you lashed out? And whilst your frustration's building, you're lashing out and the customers aren't getting fed. Zach, second nominee and why? Our second nominee is... After a rough dinner service where almost the entire team was kicked out of the kitchen, the men have made a tough decision. We have nominated Jeremy. But they are not done yet. Second nominee and why? Our second nominee is... Sebastian. Why? Sebastian is a good guy, but there's a time and a place to play. "Zachy-wacky" in the middle of serv... like, you know, we're trying to execute dishes. We can't have that going on. If you're not serious now, I don't got you getting serious at all. Jeremy, Sebastian, step forward. Let's go. Sebastian, seriously? You want to around in the middle of service? Why did you come in here? I love cooking. This is something I love to do, and I've been... I've put in my time. Today. I know I dropped the ball. It's just sometimes my personality comes out in the kitchen. Before I came here, I knew one of my biggest problems, one of my biggest challenges, is my attitude. And it's something I have to correct. Jeremy. You're one of the youngest in this competition. I thought you were in way over your head. Why do you think you should stay in Hell's Kitchen? Chef, I've fought for everything in my life. I've strived to do better. I've alwaydone better, chef. I've succeeded at almost everything I've tried. Today I failed. I don't plan on failing ever again, chef. I let my team down, and I never do that. Not only did you let your team down, you then gave them . You got yourself in the weeds. You started giving to the team. That was one comment, chef. One comment? One comment. Tough call. The person leaving Hell's Kitchen... Sebastian, give me your jacket. Keep doing what I said. Yeah, man. It's a kitchen, not a place for comedians. Good night. Right now, I'm disappointed with myself. I came here thinking that the challenge was going to be to beat the other chefs and win Hell's Kitchen, and I found a way to defeat myself. Hell's Kitchen, man. It's no joke. This is not a game for me. This is serious business. Understand? Yes, chef. Get out of here. Now this is a fight, and I'm not leaving. I'm staying. Only bad thing about winning tonight, we can't send Gina home. But if we lose, she the first sucker that's getting voted off. I'm voting with two hands, and my hoo-ha's count as two, too, so that's four hands all day. I can't keep carrying these guys. I can't keep throwing 'em on my back. Biggest question on my mind is, who's the next I'm getting out of here 'cause the star, the head chef here is chef Zach. Sebastian tried to be funny, but it was his cooking that was the joke. Next time on Hell's Kitchen... The women celebrate their win... The red team, congratulations. By having an all-out war. If you want to argue, just press the bell, bitch. Don't call me bitch. You crazy. Don't call me crazy. I said, "bitch, you crazy and deranged." The teams try a bonding exercise. Backs up against the wall. Get down, break it up. Careful. Stop pushing. But there's a shocking departure. Pack your stuff, and leave Hell's Kitchen. And will an explosive dinner service... Let's go, then, we're still serving... communication! Get some momentum! Push one chef... Have you got a drinking problem? Too far? I mean, this is harder than hard. All next time on a truly dangerous... You may have to go to the hospital. Get out! Get out! All of you, get the out of here! Highly dramatic... People are just dropping like flies. Hell's Kitchen. Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com
