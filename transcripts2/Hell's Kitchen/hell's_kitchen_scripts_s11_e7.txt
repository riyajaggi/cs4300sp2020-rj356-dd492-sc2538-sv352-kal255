Tonight was such a [bleep] disaster, I've decided to do something I've never, ever, ever done before. All four of you... Are now... On probation. Go back in line. (Ray) Thank you, chef. (Mary) Thank you, chef. Don't thank me yet, and here's why. Each and every one of you will have to earn your jacket back by the end of the next dinner service, and if you don't, you're history. Piss off. I can't believe we're still here. I can't believe I'm still here. I live to have another day in Hell's Kitchen! Mary, bitch, you're a cat. [Chuckles] [Screeches] You got nine lives, girl. I just want to show chef Ramsay that I deserve to have my jacket back. I'm gonna fight with everything I've got. We'll get our jackets back. Dan [bleep] up the station. Right. (Michael) I kept hearing him whine and whine and whine. I'd rather have somebody positive than somebody negative on the team. Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. You know what? [Bleep] you, [bleep] you. Dan, man, you need to get over yourself, cuz. Nope. [Bleep] you, then. [Bleep] off, Dan. Piece of [bleep]. You gotta earn my respect back. You earn your coat back first. I will. Don't worry about it. I'll have it back tomorrow. (Ray) Dan, are you serious? You're not gonna get your chef coat back acting like a little bitch, okay? You talk all you want, man. Action. Be a man and prove that [bleep]. End of conversation. (Announcer) It was the most tense night in Hell's Kitchen so far, and this morning, in today's challenge, all of the chefs will be tested once again. Gettin' these jackets back, ladies. (Announcer) But for the four chefs on probation, this is their first chance to win their jackets back. (Gordon) Good morning. (All) Good morning, chef. (Gordon) You can probably guess from the decor... [Gong sounds] Your next challenge, we're gonna be working with Chinese food. I'm from the 'hood. I like Chinese food. We got a Chinese store every other block. Chinese store on 10th, Chinese store on 11th, Chinese store on 21st, 30th street, 40th street, 52nd street, 56th street. I know a little bit about Chinese food. Each team will create their version of six stunning, traditional Chinese dishes: Chow mein, spring rolls, dumplings, Chinese soup, classic fried rice, and finally, stir fry. I lived in Asia for a year, so I'm gonna nail it. This is my competition now. We have over 200 fortune cookies. In each cookie is a name of an ingredient. Two of you from each team will be manning the boards, and the rest of you will be running ingredients up to them to decide which five ingredients goes into which dish. One more thing, you'll be carrying your fortune cookies to the board with... chopsticks. Starting from...now. [Dramatic music] [Yells] [Screams] [Laughter] [Yells] Oh, Susan. [Laughter] [Laughter] Back over there. Come on. Way too easy. Come on. It's Hell's Kitchen, guys. [Laughs] These cookies don't work for me. These are the fortune cookies you'll be carrying across the room. [Laughter] I can't pick up a little cookie with chopsticks. How am I gonna pick up a big cookie with chopsticks? Ooh, lord, help me [bleep]. Red team, blue team, I want you to decide which two of you will be manning the board. Let's go. Quick. Huddle up. You feel strong in Asian cuisine? Hurry up. Who knows Asian cuisine really well? I lived in Asia for a year. (Dan) I am getting my jacket back today. Big risks equal big rewards, so put me on the board. Okay, ladies, give me the names of the two who are gonna arrange the menu for you. Ja'nel and Jacqueline. (Gordon) Ja'nel and Jacqueline. Jacqueline and I are definitely the most comfortable with Asian cuisine, and we're gonna make sure everyone knows it wasn't a bad decision. Blue team, who's manning the board? Chef, it'll be myself and Dan. Wow. You both haven't got jackets. Yeah, we know that, chef. We'll be fine, chef. This is not gonna be hard. These ingredients pick themselves. I can't [bleep] this up. Everybody ready? Three minutes. Make it count. Starting from... Now. Let's go. Go, girls, go! (Announcer) For today's challenge in Chinese cuisine, each team has three minutes to gather five ingredients for each of their six classic dishes. Let's go, let's go, let's go. (Announcer) The pressure is on ja'nel and Jacqueline... I'll crack 'em. Jackie, you pick 'em up. (Announcer) And Dan and Ray, to make sure the right combination of ingredients are well-suited for each of the dishes. (Barret) Got vegetables right here. Bean thread or wheat noodles for the chow mein? What do you think? Which one? Both? (Ray) Dan, he's asking me a lot of questions. I thought you went to Asia. Why you [bleep] asking me? Where do you want squid? (Dan) Squid? Squid? Egg noodles! We need some sauces. Can we get purple? Sauces, we need sauces. Sauces? Purple, guys, purple. If I knew we had to run today, I would have put on three bras to tie these bitches down. Wonton wrappers. Ooh! Stir fry, we need what? Last minute, guys. Let's go! Button mushrooms. We need to load this up, the spring rolls. Do we need any more noodles? No more noodles. I see we only have four ingredients on some of our things, and... Corn! I know we need five, so I'm just starting to shout out some of these ingredients that are laying on the table... Rice, white rice. You got a rice? Hoping that they'll pick something and put it up there. Wonton wrappers, wonton wrappers. (Gordon) Three... I need, uh... I got rice. Two... Dumplings. Dumplings? Brown rice. Chinese hot mustard. One...and stop! All line up. [Exhales] Good job, guys. They have more ingredients on the board. (Gordon) Ladies, you've got five out of six dishes all missing ingredients. Are you kidding me? Ja'nel and Jackie totally blew it. You've got 40 minutes to create six stunning dishes. You guys figure out who's doing what, starting from...now. Off you go. Let's go. All right, guys. Who wants to do what? Uh, I'll do soup. I want to do spring rolls. There are eight of us, and there's only six dishes. We have to figure this out. I don't know. Cyndi, do you think two people on dumplings? (Cyndi) Uh, yeah. Mary. Yeah, dumplings? (Susan) Dumplings. No starch for stir fry. No rice, or anything? (Jessica) Nothing. We didn't put any rice up, guys? Seriously? Jackie and Ja'nel seriously dropped the ball. They really screwed us. I wish I had napa cabbage on the spring rolls. (Ja'nel) I put the cabbage in the spring roll. It was the last one I put up there. We don't got none of that. If it was on the board, it'd be here. (Announcer) While the ladies find their ingredients underwhelming, the men... (Zach) Whoo! Let's go, guys, we can do it! (Announcer) Are overwhelmingly confident. Come on, guys, I want to win. I want to see my boys back in the blue. Hell, yeah. (Announcer) But there is one exception. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. I've never made a chow mein, guys. Basically, it's like making a stir fry, man. You put all your noodles, and you just toss, toss, toss. Okay. I'm looking at my ingredients, and I don't even know what to do with this stuff. How do you cook Chinese food? Those are, uh, daikon, right? The... Is it? I've never had it, I'm not gonna lie. Ah, yes, daikon radish, something I cook with all the time. Ah, what the [bleep]! [Groans] Ooh, yeah, it's different. Just lay 'em down on the plate, Mary. (Gordon) One minute to go. (All) Yes, chef! I feel good about working with Cyndi, but my jacket's at stake, and I really should have taken a dish by myself. Let's go. Start plating. Plating? Everybody's plating? Plating! Everybody's plating. Plating. Ooh, Jess, that looks amazing. (Gordon) 30 seconds to go! Give me the plate. Where's the plate? This is terrible. This is [bleep] terrible. No. It's coming down to the wire. The blue team is a hot mess. (Gordon) Ten seconds to go. Not working. Oh, my God. We're gonna lose again. Help me out. Sauce, sauce, sauce. Get it on, get it on, get it on. Four, three... Looks like [bleep]. This is literally... (Gordon) Two... Catastrophically... (Gordon) One! Terrible. Come on. (Anthony) We're screwed. (Announcer) Today, it's the first-ever Hell's Kitchen challenge in Chinese cuisine... Ten seconds to go. (Announcer) And after losing four straight challenges, the men are desperate to break their losing streak. Sauce, sauce. Get it on, get it on, get it on. (Gordon) Five, four... (Announcer) However, Anthony's chow mein has the blue team feeling a bit concerned. (Gordon) One, and stop! I hope all of you have created world-class dishes, because judging your dishes tonight is an award-winning chef... Martin Yan. [Applause] [Chinese music] ♪ [Laughter] Awesome! That's amazing. ♪ Oh, my God. ♪ Welcome. Good to see you. My pleasure. Holy crap, I am about to put something that I've never cooked before in front of chef Ramsay and chef Yan. [Scoffs] Battle of the fried rice, please. Let's go. I'm getting my jacket back right now, 'cause I lived in Asia for a year. What do you eat while you live in Asia for a year? Asian food. Let's go. Jacqueline, explain it to chef. Okay, we have a firm tofu with a little bit of chili pepper, scallions, rice wine vinegar, and bean sprouts. This is the first time I've ever taste fried rice use rice vinegar. Mm-hmm. It works, though, chef, doesn't it? (Martin) It works. Mm-hmm. Dan, let's go. Fried rice with mushrooms. I also used a little bit of coconut milk, and loosely crushed peanuts, and some sweet and spicy glazed prawns. Presentation looks great. (Dan) Thank you, chef. The rice is a little bit undercooked. Chinese rice should never be undercooked. Dan, is that how they served the rice in Asia, where you lived there for a year? (Gordon) Which one do you prefer? I prefer the flavor, and the imagination, and the creativity of... Red team! Yes! Yeah, Jackie! Good job! All right. Hey, Dan, go back to Asia for another year. Uh, right, next up, the stir fry. Let's go. (Jon) This is my stir fry here. Wheat noodles, there are sea scallops, also a little mirin soy sesame oil. It's very difficult not to overcook this, so you overcook this, you ruin it. [Speaking Chinese] Means "amazing." Not overcooked. Good. It's very good. Very good. Thank you, chef, thank you, chef. (Gordon) Well done, Jon. Good job. (Jessica) My dish is more of an appetizer dish. (Gordon) I mean, it looks a very weird stir fry. This is supposed to be a stir fry, but you serve it differently. I didn't have a lot of components to work with, so... I don't want you to make an excuse in front of the chef, please. He's given up his day to be here. Jessica, what is wrong with you? Take responsibility for that. Which one do you prefer? I will give... The blue team! (Gordon) Blue team, good. [Bleep] All right, we got a point. A point is a point is a point. Okay, next up. Spring roll, please. Let's go. (Announcer) With the score tied, Barret's zesty lime spring roll... Very imaginative. Very, very nice. (Announcer) Goes head-to-head with Nedra's peanut sriracha spring roll. (Martin) This is more a vietnamese-style spring roll. I give, blue team! Thank you, chef. (Announcer) With the men leading, Ray's crab dumpling... I like the shape, because this is how you knead it. Yeah. And it takes skill. (Announcer) Is up against cyndi's honey soy dumpling... Sweet and sour and spicy. (Announcer) And although both dishes impress... The red team! [Cheering] (Announcer) Cyndi gets the point, evening the score. The battle of the soup. Let's go. (Announcer) Ja'nel's lemongrass red miso soup... Incorporation of lemongrass actually give it a little kick. (Announcer) Packs a punch... Very nice. (Announcer) While Michael's sweet and sour Halibut soup... I like the overall presentation. (Announcer) Does not disappoint. Two good soups. Which one do you prefer? I... look at this as a draw. One point and one point. It all comes down to the chow mein. Let's go, Suzie. Come on, Suzie. Bring it home, Suzie, 5-0. (Gordon) Let's go. Susan, explain your chow mein to the chef, please. Yes, chef. I have... Rice noodle. A rice noodle with pork that I did a quick marinade on, and I threw in some crushed cashews. (Martin) I like the flavor. The bean sprouts give it a really nice, wonderful texture, but I prefer to have a little bit more color contrast. Green onion would really, really perk it up. Okay, Anthony, please, let's go. Chefs, I made a very simple wheat and rice noodle chow mein with daikon radish, and it's topped with candied ginger. Very interesting combination. I like the texture contrast, and this is a very good chow mein dish. Oh, my God. He is complimenting my dish. We're tied right now, and it's all down to the chow mein. Please say blue team wins. Come on, blue team, blue team. Tough one now, because your decision is gonna decide which team wins. I'm not worried. I definitely think we have this one in the bag. I hope chef Gordon also agree with me. I will give this... The blue team! [Cheering] Thank you, chef. Thank you, chef. Yahtzee, baby! That's awesome! Ah, yeah. That's the way, Uncle Ray. We finally won a challenge. Thank you, lord. Thank you, chef! Thank you, chef! Thank you, chef! Well done. Pleasure. Dan and Ray, I'm gonna give both of you your jackets back. Yes! Give my boys their jackets. Good job. Dan, welcome back. Thank you, chef. Thank you, chef. Mwah! Ah, you're mine. You're staying with me. Stay right here, baby. Ha ha! (Gordon) Blue team, I have the most amazing way for all of you to unwind today. We need it, chef. It's a surprise, okay? (Zach) That's fine. So head upstairs and get changed. Whoo! Finally. [Laughter] [Trilling tongue] Wow. It's about time, and the best part is... Look what I got. Hee hee hee! Ladies, you have a humongous amount of preparation ahead of tonight's dinner service, and one of our highlights will be the beef pot stickers and steamed dumplings. These items require great attention to detail, so focus. Out you go. Yes, chef. (Mary) I'm on my last legs here. If I don't earn my jacket back, I don't live to see another day. So freakin' scary. Did we find a broom yet, or no? Our kitchen was a lot cleaner. Who knows how to make the beurre monte? (Cyndi) I do. We need it for both kitchens. [Cheering] Oh, here they come. [All cheering, clapping] What goes around comes around, bitches. All right, all right, all right. What up, ladies? Have fun. We'll bring you something nice. (Anthony) How 'bout that, yeah? Take that, skanks. Whatever the reward is, bring it on, man. I just need the sun on my face. [Laughter] This is awesome, yeah? We're paintballing, bitches, and the object: Kill Dan. [Paintball guns firing rapidly] I'm hunting Dan. Bring it on. Pah! [Paintball guns firing rapidly] Boom! Boom! Boom, boom! [Paintball guns firing rapidly] [Mimicking paintball guns] Ah, stop! Pah, pah, pah! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! [Yelling] Bye-bye. That's game! [Whistle blowing] [Cheering] It was fun shooting Dan. So therapeutic. I loved it. [Laughs] (Announcer) While the blue team enjoys getting physical out in the sun, back at Hell's Kitchen... My back hurts. (Announcer) The red team is not enjoying the tedious physical labor. This is delicate work. To make these little dumplings is so [bleep] tedious. Hunched over, one after another, after another. I don't like punishment, not one damn bit. What that... I'm hungry, though, that's fo' sho'. Yeah, right? I ain't down for this punishment stuff. Let's hurry up and finish prepping so a bitch can go get a snack or somethin'. Chef Ramsay has prepared something really special for you guys. It's a delicacy: Balut eggs. Oh, man. Oh! We have a balut egg, which is a baby chicken in an egg. [Mock retches] (Andi) Eat up. You gotta eat 'em fast, guys. I'm not puttin' that in my mouth, I'm sorry. The first one I cracked open had a little baby chicken: Bill and feet, eyes, wings, feathers, everything. We have to eat all of them? (Cyndi) I'm gonna say yes. We have so much work ahead of us. The faster we get this done, the faster we can move on. It's best if we can all just suck it up and just push through. Oh, I can't do it if I make eye contact. Is the eyeball big? [Shudders] [Coughs] [Retching] (Susan) We have to eat it. I'm not eating this. This is nasty! (Announcer) The red team has experienced their first challenge loss... Don't vomit, 'cause it'll start a chain reaction. [Retching] (Announcer) And are now getting their first taste of failure. I'm gonna throw up. (Andi) Come on, guys, you have a busy day today. Let's go. [Retches] (Cyndi) Hold it back. Hold it back. [Retches] Come on, guys. [Retches] I would've rather have eaten raw chicken than what I just ate today. (Andi) Girls, let's go. Yes, chef. I seriously feel like puking. I do too. Make sure we have everything. If we don't... what about the men's side, who's doing that? (All) [Chanting] Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. Yeah. (Ray) Hey, how's my little dumplings doing? Whatever happened out in the field, we'll leave in the field. It's time to get back in the kitchen now and knock out this dinner service. Now, we're gonna start taking the red out one by one. Honestly, I feel that you are ready for a bloody good dinner service. (All) Yes, chef. So we are launching our chef's tables tonight. In the blue kitchen, you'll be taking care of a very funny actor. He was associated with the hit series Entourage as Ari's assistant. Rex Lee is gracing the chef's table in the blue kitchen the evening. Rex Lee, this is the creme de la creme, and we gotta make sure this [bleep] is right. Ladies, you'll be cooking for a Hollywood heavy-hitter, directed the Wedding Planner, Hairspray, Rock of Ages. Mr. Adam Shankman and his guests will be gracing your table in the red kitchen tonight, okay? (All) Yes, chef. Good. Mary, are you ready for your jacket? Yes, chef.

Oh, yeah. (Announcer) In addition to his classic menu... The cauliflower risotto. Sourdough-crusted halibut. (Announcer) Tonight, chef Ramsay has added a tableside dim sum cart, which will be looked after by Ja'nel on the red side of the dining room, and Ray on the blue side. (Gordon) Okay, ladies, here we go. Good luck. (Mary) Yes, chef. Four covers, table 34. One dim sum, one risotto, two scallops. (All) Yes, chef. You have one risotto. Gonna rock out and get my jacket back. I need a little chicken stock, excuse me. You know, the jacket is protective. It protect your arms, your hoo-has. You ready with the first risotto? Walking! Walking with the lobster. We need our [bleep] jackets back. (Gordon) Come on, let's go. Right behind you with the first risotto, chef. (Gordon) Nedra! Yes, chef? Come here! Oh, my gosh. Here we go. We cannot screw this up tonight. Risotto, delicious. Really delicious. Off you go, jacket on. (Nedra) Thank you, chef. Whoo! I got my jacket on. Tha... thank you.

Two scallops, one dim sum, one cappellini. Run with the capp. Right here, right here. Ready to go. Walking with it! (Announcer) Jon and Anthony are in total sync on their appetizers... (Gordon) Very nice. (Announcer) And have earned chef Ramsay's praise. Service, please. (Announcer) But in the dining room, Ray is way behind. So sorry. Ray is gonna come and do your dim sum as well. Yeah. (Announcer) And appetizers from the kitchen are hitting the tables ahead of Ray's dim sum. J.P., he needs to speed up a little bit. Hi, ladies. The guys are abso-[bleep] killing me over here, seriously. I'll take this back. They need to slow down, because I'm by myself. I need another risotto because this is cold now, chef, because I was too slow... Oh, [bleep] off, Ray. Fire one risotto, urgently! Yes, got a risotto going, chef. Pushing the risotto. (Announcer) While the blue team backtracks to re-fire the table of appetizers... Let's just get it going, guys. (Announcer) Chef Ramsay isn't slowing down... Two risotto, one cappellini, one dim sum. Two minutes, chef. Come on, then. Coming up. (Announcer) And if there wasn't enough pressure already, the VIP guests for the chef's table have arrived... Watch your step. (Announcer) In both the blue... Welcome, welcome. Sit back and enjoy. Thank you so much, chef. (Announcer) And the red kitchens. I'm Cyndi, I'll be serving you this evening. For your appetizer? I'll do the Caesar with prawns, please. Yes, sir. Mary? Appetizers! Yes, chef? Two risotto, one burrata, one dim sum. Yes, chef! I'm feeling really nervous right now. Nedra got her jacket back, and I'm running out of time. I'm gonna cook to save my life. Come on, Mary, please. Here's the risotto, chef. Mary? Yes, chef? Come here. Yes, chef. Risotto delicious. Get your jacket on. Thank you, chef! Uh, madam, now that you've got it, keep hold of it. Yes, chef. Yes! [Laughs] (All) Good job, Mary. Yes, chef. Go. (Announcer) With the exception of the chef's table, Mary, Nedra, and Ja'nel have served all of the appetizers. Please enjoy. Thank you. Come on, you guys, let's go! Me and Mary, we've been kicking ass and taking names. Now, we just gotta keep moving. (Gordon) Away next... (Nedra) These bitches bet' not [bleep] it up.

(Announcer) To keep everything on track. Susan, how long on two chicken? The... it's... that... We need time. Susan is a mess. I'm worried. How long? What am I supposed to do? I have two fish on that order. What do I have in there? Oh, let me check my chicken. She needs to snap out of it, get her head out of her [bleep]. I need to get this chicken right. (Announcer) While Susan checks her chicken... You ready? Yeah. Just keep moving. (Announcer) Over in the blue kitchen... Right here, right here. Walking. Let's go. (Announcer) The men have rebounded on appetizers. Very nice. All right, guys, let's just keep it calm. We're doing fine. (Gordon) Serve the chef's table, please. Let's go. There's your cappellini. I'm serving the VIP table. Want you guys to enjoy it. He's important to chef Ramsay, so he's important to me, so I'ma give him the best service possible, and I'ma do it with a smile. (Gordon) Okay, blue team. Blue team! On order: Chef, chef? Two covers away. (Gordon) Chef's table, yes? Vvip. One halibut, one cod. (All) Yes, chef. I got it. I feel great that I'm being assigned the fish station, because I've cooked fish thousands of times. VIP table's a fish table, so don't [bleep] us. Dan is just, um, an [bleep]. How long? You ready? How long you need? How long do you need, Barret? Shut the [bleep] up and let me cook. I'm ready. One cod, one halibut. I'll take your halibut sauce. Behind you, chef. Raw shrimp. Hey, guys. Hey, all of you, come here! A table sat in the kitchen and a raw [bleep] shrimp. Stone [bleep] cold. I guess you're not as good as you think you are, Barret. Barret! Yes, chef? (Gordon) How dare you! (Announcer) While Barret has messed up the entrees for the VIP chef's table in the blue kitchen... Food looks good. It's just not coming our way. (Announcer) Chef Ramsay is looking for some better execution from the red team. Where's the ticket? I'm ready with chicken! Go ahead, I'm ready. Coming, chef. Chicken. Service, please. (Gordon) Next table! On order, three covers. Chef's table, yes? (All) Yes, chef. One halibut, one cod, one lamb. Lamb requested medium. (All) Yes, chef. Let's go, Susan. Yes, chef. That lamb's gotta be perfect. Chef Ramsay obviously feels confident. That's why he's put me on the meat station by myself. I need to make sure this lamb is medium. Do we even have the cod in the pan? Yes. Yes, cod is in the pan, in the oven. (Susan) I feel ahead of the game. Can I slice? You can slice. Everything's on point. [Bleep]! This [bleep] lamb! This is really raw. These lambs are a son of a bitch. They just take forever to cook. Walking cod and halibut. Yeah, really? I need some time on my lamb, guys! How long for the chef's table? Chef, we're dragging on the lamb. Just hurry up, Susan! Drive the table! Got it, chef. This is a VIP table. I have everybody yelling at me for this lamb to be done, but I can't make the oven cook it any faster. (Gordon) Susan, come on! [Groans] How long, Susan? Coming, chef. [Bleep]! Oh, [bleep]. I just dropped my lamb, guys. (Gordon) Oh, for [bleep] sake. (Announcer) It's 90 minutes into dinner service... How long, Susan? (Announcer) And all that's needed to complete the entree order on the chef's table is lamb. Coming, chef. (Announcer) But thanks to Susan... Oh, no. (Announcer) They won't be getting fed... [Bleep]! (Announcer) Any time soon. I just dropped the lamb. Oh. (Gordon) Is that the lamb medium? Yes, chef. Oh, my God. I can't believe you dropped the damn lamb for the VIP table! Bitch, you better get your [bleep] together quick, homegirl. How long on that lamb? Still need five minutes. Five minutes out on the chef's table. I am highly aware that they screwed up our order. It's gonna be eight minutes. It's raw. The meat and the fish station have to work cohesively. It's just becoming chaos. Susan, how much longer on the medium lamb? Four minutes. Is Susan gonna be ready in four minutes? Hey, blondie! Yeah, airhead. How long? Five minutes, chef. I'm getting different times. My fish are overcooking because Susan can't let me know how much longer. What's all this for? It's overcooked, all that. Yes, chef. Oh, no. How long's it been sat there? It's been sitting here for five minutes. [Bleep]. Why aren't you communicating? Do you care? Jessica's a mess tonight, but it didn't help that meat was giving us inaccurate times. So how long for the chef's table? It'll be seven minutes, chef. (Announcer) While the VIP table continues to wait... (Gordon) The two halibuts, we can go with that. Okay. Good. Let's go. Table 22, we'll go with that now. (Announcer) Chef Ramsay pushes forward with some of the red team's other tables. Really good. (Announcer) Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen... Barret, come on! Yes, chef. (Announcer) Barret is finally ready with his second attempt at the VIP table's entrees. (Gordon) halibut, please. Yeah, lovely. Zach, serve one of the courses to the chef's table. Yes, chef. Go. (Michael) At this point, I mean, we really can't afford to have anything done improperly... Two Wellington, two halibut, two lamb. How long? Three minutes, chef. And unfortunately, we're depending on Dan. Start slicing lamb, oui? Slicing. Gorgeous. I'm on the meat station tonight, riding solo. The spotlight is on me. Hey, I'm ready to walk lamb. 90 seconds, 90 seconds. (Gordon) Hey, Barret? Yes, chef? Hurry up, will you please? Yes, chef. Go ahead, buddy. It's a perfect lamb. (Gordon) Yeah. Service, please. Ooh, Michael, you see that lamb? "Dan." "Yes, chef?" "Perfect." I know, I cooked it. Good job, guys. Dan, you're doing awesome, buddy. Thank you. Winner. I'm like Charlie Sheen. All I do is [bleep] win. Beautifully cooked. (Dan) Thank you, chef. (Announcer) While Dan is having his best dinner service in Hell's Kitchen so far... Here is your cod, sir. (Announcer) The VIPs at the chef's table in the red kitchen are getting their entrees. Your lamb. Thank you so much, appreciate it. You're very welcome. It's... all the food is delicious. (Announcer) And now, the red team... Last ticket. (Announcer) Is moving on to their final ticket. Two Wellington, one cod, one halibut. Coming down the line. Walking with entrees. Halibut arriving, chef. Halibut's raw. Halibut is raw. Does it bother you, at least? No, you're not bothered? Hey, look. She doesn't care anymore. She's going through the motions. Oh, my God. Hey, you're done, aren't you? No, chef, I'm not. (Announcer) While the women... Come on, ladies, come on. (Announcer) Try to recover from Jessica's blunder, the men... Chef, I'm right behind you with three Wellingtons. (Announcer) Are delivering their last set of entrees to the pass. Dan, the Wellington's cooked perfectly. Thank you, chef. Good job, Dan. Thank you. (Announcer) They're just missing... Two halibut. I'm dying! Barret, talk to me! Two... Two halibut, four minutes out. Yeah, I'm waiting for two halibut. Go, and come back for the halibut, please. Quick. Barret! Yes, chef. I put you on there tonight to test you. Come on! Yes, chef. I got it. Come on, Barret, let's hammer this halibut out so we can finish this service. (Gordon) Halibut, how long? Coming right up behind me. They are plating it now. It's okay. Hey, all of you, come here. [Bleep]. See those six glamorous ladies, slightly older? Yeah? And look. Oh. Oh, my God. (Announcer) It's two hours into dinner service... Come on, Barret. Yes, chef. (Announcer) And Barret has finally delivered two orders of halibut to complete the blue team's last ticket. Oh, my God. (Announcer) But chef Ramsay... Hey, all of you, come here. (Announcer) Is not exactly pleased. Look. The paper. Paper. Oh, my God. Paper. You left the parchment on it, man? (Zach) What, you trying to kill people? By the time you swallow it, it's too late. You're on the floor with Jean-Philippe doing CPR on you. [Scoffs] Who the [bleep] want that? Hey, come here, you. Yes, chef. [Bleep] joke. You should be ashamed. I am. I am ashamed. Tonight, of all nights, I'm just praying that we didn't lose this dinner service. Paper. To a senior. (Announcer) While Barret starts over on the fish, in the red kitchen, the women are very excited... This is our last ticket! (Announcer) To be closing in on the finish line. We got this! Hey. Yes, chef? Shut the [bleep] up. High-fiving each other. "Last ticket." It's the same [bleep] ticket. Two Wellington, two chicken, one halibut, one cod. Wellington walking! Cod. (Gordon) Let's go. Behind. Hot. Finally. Service, please. Go. Zach. Zach! Serve it. (Announcer) Both kitchens... Service, please. (Announcer) Finally manage to successfully deliver properly cooked fish. There you are. Thank you. Here you are, my love. I apologize about the wait, ladies, and I apologize about the mistakes. (Announcer) And dinner service is complete. Suck [bleep]. (Announcer) But no one is in the mood for celebrating. Stoves off. I really thought that this was gonna be a night to remember. I didn't expect such ridiculous errors. And that is why I have no choice but to declare the red team... And the blue team... As losers. It's time to drop some dead weight. Each team, nominate your two weakest chefs for elimination. Got it? (All) Yes, chef. Get out of here. (All) Yes, chef. (Dan) The blue team... they may have lost today, but a little victory pour moi, right here. This is definitely a dinner service that I wanna crumble up into a ball and throw away. Just complete and utter chaos tonight. It was two people on fish station, and fish still went down. (Ja'nel) Jessica, you should've taken responsibility. I did, how many times am I supposed to ask before she comes up with an answer? You can't keep blaming it on me, Jessica, seriously. I was talking tonight. I was confident in my station. I still deserve to be here. I just wanna say this. It was, like, at least eight or nine pieces of halibut thrown away tonight. I did see a lot of fish go in the garbage. Is it because they're cooking fish bad? It was the re-fires. Look, if Susan doesn't go up tonight, that's not right, dude. She didn't communicate on the meat station, and that [bleep] us very badly, so... But I was by myself, and I think communication goes both ways. I am absolutely not the weakest chef here. If I am up for elimination tonight, I will not go down without the biggest fight that you have ever seen. Well, who's the weakest chef? None of us are. Logically, the only way to [bleep] do this is we gotta put Barret up because he [bleep] up tonight. Fish put us to a grinding halt during dinner service. I'm gonna agree with Barret. I don't deserve to go home. What made me get backed up was Raymond on tableside. If anybody should be going home tonight, it should be Ray. 51 years old, memory's really not there. He gets jumbled up sometimes. He's the weakest link. Okay, so, second vote? Raymond. My reason is the tableside. It screwed us up in the kitchen. It just caused problems. Yeah, but dude, it... the people that got my dim sum liked it, they had a good time. I don't deserve to be up for nomination. I've been doing this for a long time, I'm older than these guys, I am better than these [bleep] guys. Chef tells us whenever we go for elimination, two weakest chefs on the team, not who had a bad service. So the person that we should be putting up right now would be Dan. What? Are you kidding me? [Bleep] you guys. No, that's some [bleep] backhanded [bleep]. You're dead weight. Everything I sent out was beautiful. I see how it is. Put me up on the heels of a perfect service, let's see how that ends. Red team, have you reached a decision? (All) Yes, chef. (Gordon) Thank goodness for that. Mary? Yes, chef? First nominee and why, please. (Mary) Our first nominee tonight is Jessica, chef. Jessica. She was the driver of the fish station tonight, and just... the communication between meat and fish tonight, chef. Second nominee and why. Our second nominee is... Susan. (Gordon) Susan. Just inconsistent time calling, chef. [Exhales] Uh, blue team, have you reached a decision? (All) Yes, chef. Dan, you worked singlehandedly this evening. Blue team's first nominee and why? Blue team's first nominee is myself, chef. And why? I'm the weakest member of the team, chef. I had a fantastic performance, and they put me up 'cause I'm the weakest. Jon, you're shaking your head. We feel like he's constantly just slipping through the cracks. Um, second nominee and why. The second-weakest link in the team... Uh... (Announcer) After an inconsistent dinner service, chef Ramsay has asked both teams to nominate two people for elimination. The red team has chosen... Susan. (Announcer) And... Jessica. (Announcer) And the blue team has decided on... Blue team's first nominee is myself, chef. (Announcer) And their second nominee is... Uh... Raymond, chef. According to the team, had a lackluster performance that could've set us behind. Okay, Dan, Raymond, Susan, Jessica, step forward, please. Jessica, watching you on service is like deadpan, no response. And you have this blank stare. Why do you think you should stay in Hell's Kitchen? Chef, I'm not done here. It wasn't my best performance. I have so much more to prove, and I have so much more to give. I think you trashed more fish than you actually served. Susan, timing was way off. Yes, chef. No control, no communication. I did make some mistakes tonight, chef, but I guarantee you that I will come back, I will fight, and I will prove to you that I will be better than I ever have been. I will make you so proud of me, chef. I promise you that, chef. Oh, dear. Ray, seriously? I'm getting tired of you standing in front of me. Sure. I don't blame you, chef. Yeah. You weren't even cooking in the kitchen tonight... I understand that, chef. And you're [bleep] nominated. I know you're looking for a chef/line cook, somebody to be on the line. I'm looking for a leader. You can't even run a [bleep] trolley tableside. Dan, why do you think you should stay in Hell's Kitchen, straight up? Figure I'm just gonna let my performance in the kitchen today speak for itself, chef, that's why I should be here. So, who should've been up here instead of you? Based on tonight's performance, Barret, chef. (Gordon) Barret. (Dan) Yes, chef. Is that right, Barret? (Barret) No, chef, we're basing it as a whole, as who is the weakest links on the team. [Sighs] My decision is... Dan. Back in line. That's right. Stop. (Gordon) Here's why you're not leaving. You ran the section singlehandedly. Thank you, chef. And whilst the blue team think that you're not a team player, one thing I'm gonna confirm is you can [bleep] cook. Thank you, chef. Now, the person leaving Hell's Kitchen... Jessica. Give me your jacket, please. Your time is done in Hell's Kitchen. I'm not feeling it. I haven't got any more patience. Thank you. (Jessica) During this experience, I tried to stay very confident and very strong, and that came across as not passionate, and that sucks. I guess I just didn't put up enough fight for chef Ramsay to believe in me. Here's something you all need to know. We have got a long way to go, and only the passionate will survive. Got it? (All) Yes, chef! Now [bleep] off. I'm a little bummed that Dan didn't go. Chef Ramsay said he can cook. All of us can cook. There's gonna be no living with this kid after this. Starting now, I'm an individual. [Bleep] the team. Chef saying that I can cook... that should be putting a fire under everybody's ass. Now you should see me as a [bleep] threat. I'm putting everything on the table. I don't care who I have to fight, I'm gonna fight. The end of the day, I'm here to win Hell's Kitchen. And that's what I'm gonna do. (Gordon) When Jessica first arrived, I had high expectations for her. Unfortunately, she let us both down. (Announcer) Next time, on Hell's Kitchen... Nedra, we're running out of time! (Announcer) Can Nedra face her biggest fear... [Screaming] What if we don't get to cook? [Screams] Come on, Nedra, you're killing us! (Announcer) Or blow the competition for her team? It's only a matter of time before we vote her off. (Announcer) And one chef's mistake... Pink chicken. Chef James's wife is pregnant. Oh, my gosh. (Announcer) May send someone to the E.R. (Nedra) Raw chicken. What the hell are you thinking? (Announcer) And it all leads to a bombshell, as one chef speaks his mind. [Bleep]. How dare you! Put that on TV. (Announcer) And walks out of Hell's Kitchen. [Bleep] you. [Pig squeals] (Announcer) All next time. Bitch, I told you! (Announcer) On the wildest Hell's Kitchen... (Gordon) At this stage in the game, I don't expect to hear "I'm sorry!" (Announcer) Of the year. Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com
