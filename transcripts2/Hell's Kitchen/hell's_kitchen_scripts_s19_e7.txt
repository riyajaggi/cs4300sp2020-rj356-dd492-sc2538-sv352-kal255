  Male narrator: Previously  on hell's kitchen...
 Marc: We got to start from scratch.
  Narrator: Marc tried  to put his issues
  with the blue team behind him.
 I want to work well with you guys.
  I'm over arguing  with the blue team.
 That turned the house against me.
  Narrator: In the morning,  both teams found
  something to celebrate...
 -It's my birthday. -Happy birthday!
  Narrator: And their challenge  started on a high note.
 Yeah!
  Narrator: The chefs first  unleashed some energy.
  (rock music)
 ♪ lobster ravioli, yeah
  narrator: And then they had to  modernize an italian classic.
 -Mary lou: Biggest side first? -Yep.
 Mary lou: It's good when you can see
 your fingers underneath.
 Who's [bleep] risotto is this? It's burned.
  Narrator: And while lauren  and amber rocked out...
 -Beautiful. -Yeah.
 Thank you.
  Narrator: Jordan...
 Jon: My risotto's undercooked.
 Thank you, chefs.
  Narrator: Syann...
 I'm judging you on tortellini.
 There isn't any there.
  Narrator: And josh...
 -It's too dense. -Yeah.
  Narrator: All fell flat.
 Josh: That's how my birthday's gonna start today?
  Narrator: In dinner service,  josh was lost on garnish...
 Ramsay: All of you, taste the mash.
 -Adam: Salt, salt, salt. -Ramsay: Bland, bland.
  Narrator: And amber drowned  on the fish station.
 Look, raw.
 Come on, amber. What's happening?
 I know you can do better than this.
 I know how to cook salmon.
  Narrator:  Over in the red kitchen...
 Oh, jordan, [bleep] hell, man.
  (tense music)
 I do not get it.
  Narrator: Jordan's scallops  took a wallop.
 Tough, tough, tough it up.
  Narrator: And the meat statin  had its share of issues.
 Ramsay: And the lamb,
 that might as well be back in the field.
 -Mary lou? -Yes, chef?
 Ramsay: Drive it. Let's go.
 Yes, chef. Yes, chef.
  Narrator: But mary lou  came to the rescue
  and led her kitchen  to victory.
 -Ramsay: Mary lou? -Mary lou: Yes, chef?
 -Ramsay: Nicely cooked.
 Mary lou: I'm so [bleep] proud of you.
 I'm proud of you. You were an awes--
 oh, don't hug me in front of chef.
 Don't hug me in front of chef. Don't touch me.
 Ooh, ooh.
  Narrator: So the blue team  nominated...
 -Adam: Amber.  -Narrator: And...
 Adam: Josh.
  Narrator: Before chef ramsay  eliminated...
 Josh.
  Narrator: Ending his dream  of becoming head chef
  at hell's kitchen lake tahoe.
  (dramatic music)
  and now the continuation  of hell's kitchen.
 Now it's time to emerge as leaders.
 -Got it? -All: Yes, chef.
 -Good night. -Cody: Good night, chef.
 Declan: Thank you, chef.
 Amber: That's awful.
 I never want to disappoint chef ramsay,
  and my team threw my name  in the hat
  because they think  I'm a big threat.
  Nobody wants to be  in the final two
  with somebody who they feel  is stronger than them.
 It's so [bleep] up.
 So I just need to keep my eye on the prize.
 Wanna go in the hot tub with me?
 Oh, god, yeah, let's go in the hot tub.
 Let's all get weird.
 Mary lou: All right, let's go get in the hot tub.
 Mary's getting naked.
 Amber: I don't know how to relax,
 but if you're doing back massages,
 I bet you I can learn real quick.
 Syann: All right, cody.
 Sorry, I gotta get in here for--
 she just went through elimination.
 Cody: Holy [bleep], I see the light.
 Amber: Oh, she's good with her hands.
 I like it. I like it.
 That's 'cause she's been a lesbian before.
 She's right about that.
 What, because you used to be a lesbian?
 Syann: Uh-huh.
 I don't know how somebody used to be.
 It's just you ain't found another chick
 -you want to [bleep] with. -Yeah.
 It's all about the fingers.
 (whispers) spirit fingers.
 Ooh, I see ass. Hello.
 She's, like, wearing a thong.
 You better watch out. Cody's on the loose.
  Lauren:  Today was a stressful day.
 We made it through.
 We're still here, so, hell yeah, we're celebrating.
 This one over here, big booty judy.
 Syann: How y'all doing?
 (laughs)
 syann: Can I--can I get your number?
 Can I--can I cook for you on Wednesday nights?
 Hell yeah.
 Cody: Oh, my god.
 All right, I gotta go check my blood pressure.
 I'm gonna be out back. [bleep], lord in heaven.
 Whoo!

 -ramsay: Right, good morning. -All: Good morning, chef.
 Las vegas is now one of the culinary capitals
 -in the world, yes? -All: Yes, chef.
 Ramsay: And surf and turf
 has been a vegas staple for decades,
 but today it has evolved.
 Great chefs have been reinventing
 that dish for years,
 and that is what today's challenge is all about.
  (sweeping music)
  ♪■
  syann: I love surf and turf:
 Lobster, shrimp, scallops, a little piece of steak.
 I'm getting hungry. Sorry.
  (laughs)
 ramsay: But you're not gonna be cooking a surf and turf.
 You're gonna be tasting it.
 Oh, [bleep], I'm allergic. Great.
  I'm allergic  to shellfish.
 Holy [bleep].
 Ramsay: Each team will compete one at a time,
 and you'll be paired in groups of two.
 When I say go, first team will taste the dish,
 run into the dining room, find those proteins, run back,
 and place them next to the dish.
 If both proteins are wrong, the lights will turn red.
 (buzzer buzzes)
 if the proteins are right, the light will turn green.
 (bell chimes)
 but if you get one right and one wrong,
 the light will turn blue.
 The team that identifies all six proteins the fastest
 wins the challenge.
 Red team, you won dinner service last night,
 so you're up first.
 Jordan: This is gonna be fun.
 Ramsay: Blue team, head to the patio.
 Both: Yes, chef.
 -First pair, step up, please. -Jordan: Let's go, ladies.
 Mary lou: All right. Come on, girls.
 Ramsay: On your mark, set, go.
  Narrator:  In today's challenge,
  chef ramsay  has disguised several proteis
  to look like traditional  surf and turf dishes.
 Come on, ladies!
  Narrator: Each pair must  correctly identify
  both proteins  used to make the dish.
 -Nikki: Catfish, guys, catfish. -Lauren: Nuh-uh.
 Nikki: Looks like it.
 When we pull off that dome,
  I see fried chicken.  I see clams.
 Chicken and clams.
  It's really that easy.
 I'll get the chicken.
 Mary lou: Right there in front of you.
 Lauren: Where's chicken?
 Mary lou: Right there on your left. Right there.
 Clam, clam.

 You had one right before.
 -Work it out. -Declan: Beef.
 Amber: No, I already took that one, declan.
 Bison is right.
 Declan is so scatterbrained
  that he's picking up  the same protein boards.
 Cody: Is that--you already had that.
 -You already had that, declan. -Ramsay: (laughs)
 declan: So dungeness crab.
 No, you already took that one.
 This guy's just all over, man.

 I'm gonna taste it.
 [bleep] it. We're not getting anywhere.
 I need to taste the shellfish, even if it might kill me.

 Three minutes.
 Adam: I think it's venison. I think it's venison.
 Declan: I think it's venison. What's the whitefish?
 It wasn't catfish. Was it dirty?
 -Adam: It was halibut. -Declan: Okay, let's go.
 -Adam: Let's go. -Declan: Back in hot.
 Adam: Venison and halibut.
 (buzzer buzzes)
 ramsay: Zero. Come on, guys.
 Three minutes to go. Come on.
 Declan: (breathing heavily)
 this is not really like a taste test challenge.
 This is more like an endurance challenge.
 Codfish. Come on, fish.
 Adam: Cod for sure.
 Come on!
 I'm an old man with a bad knee.
 -Goat, cod. -(buzzer buzzes)
 nope.
 -Declan: Ostrich and monkfish. -(buzzer buzzes)

 Snapper or flounder, flounder.
 Bring a whitefish.

 -Ramsay: Seven... -Declan: Where's the monkfish?
 -Ramsay: Six, five, four... -Bring the snapper back!
 -Declan: (grunts) -ramsay: Three, two, one.

  (tense music)
  narrator: In today's surf  and turf palate challenge...
 Come on!
  Narrator: The red team  identified all six proteins
  in eight minutes,  46 seconds.
 That's a whitefish.
  Narrator: Now it's up  to adam and declan
  to determine the final two  proteins for the blue team.

  Cody: I can't tell you how  many times I yelled snapper.
 We should have won.
 Ramsay: Red team, well done.
 All: Thank you, chef.
 You girls are gonna ride this wave of victory
 to planet hollywood's rooftop flowrider surfing experience.
 (cheers and applause)
 nikki: I said I wanted to go swimming.
 -Are you ready to hang ten? -All: Yes, chef.
 -Jordan: Let's get it. -Go get ready.
 -All: Thank you, chef. -Ramsay: Well done. Good job.
  Jordan: We're going surfing.  We're gonna hang ten.
 Hell yeah.
 Oh, blue team, damn. You had it.
 Cody: That we did, chef.
 Ramsay: Right, while the ladies
 are enjoying some fun in the sun,
 you're gonna suffer through one shell of a punishment
 because you will be shelling, by hand, crab.
 Oh, great.
 I'm also allergic to crab. This is awful.
 You have to prepare all the crab that
 we need for tonight's menu.
 Right, head to the patio.
 Oh, boy, taken down by a snapper.
 Amber: I can't believe there were mussels
 in those clam shells.
 Cody: I was telling you guys, man.
  We dropped the ball  on this one.
 You gotta believe in your team, bro.
 Smoke?
 Declan: (clears throat)
 (sighs)
 amber: Do you see what's going on there?
 Mm-hmm.
 Amber: Like, cody doesn't smoke.
 What am I supposed to do?
 Nothing. You just do you.
 [bleep] them.
 It's not easy to switch teams.
  Amber: The blue team has such  a different mentality
  for how to get through  all of this together.
 Any chance somebody's not looking and they can [bleep]
 somebody over, it's gonna happen.
 If you guys are gonna have team meetings,
 you want to get everybody? 'cause--
 we're not having a team meeting.
 I came out here to smoke a cigarette.
 Like, if it's gonna be, like, let's play dirty, then fine.
 -Cody: It's not that. -Adam: Yeah, what is this--
 we're talking about measuring out the [bleep] crab cake.
 I'm just saying, like, all the girls just,
 like, literally said in front of marc and I, like,
 "hey, you realize they just said--like, cody said smoke
 and cody doesn't smoke and they left you two in here."
 adam: I don't know why you listen to the red team.
 I really just want to work as a team,
 and I don't want any problems, you know?
 Declan: So don't be listening to the girls.
 They're putting daggers into you.
 Amber: It's really uncomfortable switching teams,
 and I'm just trying to do the right thing.
 But you're on the blue team now, so chill.
 - Amber: All right. -Declan: Paranoia?
 Adam: So [bleep] annoying.
 Amber is still, like, half red team, half blue team.
 She needs to understand
 that if she wants to go far in this competition,
 she needs to be fully blue team
 or she's gonna get pushed out all the way.
 Let's go.
 Declan: Everybody got the crab cake recipe?
 Adam: Yeah, you big, beautiful beast.
 Declan: (exhales sharply)
 cody: Well, well, well. [bleep].
 Amber: Oh, my god.
 Adam: Oh. This [bleep] sucks.
 Do not get a shell in here, okay?
 That's the last thing we're gonna need.
 -Cody: Yes, chef. -Amber: Yes, chef.
 Adam: Okay, let's get it moving.
 Crab city.

  but never this many crabs.

 marc: You know, we're suffering right now.
 Cody: Hands are gonna [bleep] be raw after this [bleep].
  Declan: You separate the body  from the legs,
 and in the torso, there's small filaments in between each one,
  so you have to crack them,
  and then you pick it out  with a stick.
 You start working on the place.
  Amber: We also need  fresh shallot,
  fresh parsley,  lemon zest.
 There's a lot of components, and we need 200 crab cakes.

 Don't tell us to fire it if it's not fired--
 I didn't say fire it. I said next ticket.
