 Previously on "Good Girls"... Are we going to lose this house? I mean, I don't know. Nancy and I are suing you for custody. I would suggest that we put Sara on a list for a transplant. - How much is in the vault? - 30 grand. So when do you want to do this? Ladies and gentlemen, this is a robbery. Why does a grocery store even have this kind of money? Because it's hella shady!

 Why don't you stop worrying about my business and start figuring how you gonna pay me my money back? We have a business proposition to clean your fake money. Let us do it right here. Fake money in, real money out. Do you want all this back on the card? Cash is fine. You want to bring other people into this now? The more you buy and return, the more money you're going to make. I don't know what you've gotten me involved in, but it's something super shady. She's extorting us to tune of $10,000!

 Annie... I mean, girls like that... They want that kind of attention. Is that why you tried to rape her? No! I saw this guy. Whatever they're into, he's involved. I'm just wondering where a nice lady like you meets an inner-city gangbanger. Maybe we should turn ourselves in. He's the one who should be in jail, not us. All we have to do is get the vault open, and the cops will do the rest. Annie, put all that money back now. There has to be something that you want. The Feds and the DPD took his gang down last night because these two women robbed the place a couple nights ago. - I did it for us. - I'm a cop. What the hell am I supposed to do?

The kind that matches the ink on the envelope that you left for the Feds. - We were really careful. - Oh, yeah? How careful? Gloves and masks... 'Cause there's lipstick on it. So just, like, be me for a second, okay? I'm looking over the list, right? Picture my damn face when I see that you were a hostage in the very robbery that took down the gangbanger that you had a little, you know, uh... Playdate. Playdate with. What a small world. - I buy a lot of milk. - Is that right? It would be weird if I wasn't there. Mrs. Boland, I would love for you to stop by the station. I already gave my statement. You did, but now I need your DNA sample. I think I'd like you to leave. That's probably a good idea. And I'm calling a lawyer. Even better. You're going to go in there, and you're going to give them everything. You want me to turn myself in? - I'll go with you. - Why? Because the first in gets the best deal. Baby, that's the way it works. We'll be... Babe, they don't care about you. They just want that gang, you know? They just want to build their case, right? So you go in there, you tell them everything. You hear me? All of it. You tell them what you did, how you did it... And who you did it with. You mean Beth and Annie? Babe, they got DNA. This is over. - Beth was my maid of honor. - Look, nobody said this was going to be pretty and fair, Ruby. I used to babysit Annie. Excuse me, you made this bed. - Oh, my God. - And you made it well. I mean, it's got pillows, it's got throws, it's got duvets in it. - Oh, my God, Stan. - But you... but you did it for us, though, right? You did it for... you did it for me, you did it for Sara, you did it for Lil' Money. I mean, that's... That's what you said, right? Then you get out of it for us. I don't understand why you would use your mouth to take off a pen cap. Because I had a gun on a bunch of people. My hands were full. Yeah, but it's just so amateur. Yeah, we are amateurs. Well, what does Stan say? - About what? - About what we should do. Nothing. You guys, I got to go. Now? Yeah, I got a-a thing. Oh, here... these are for Sara for while she's laid up. Oh, that's so sweet. Yeah, I got a little something, too. Oh, please don't. I made it from all her old baby clothes... The ones you handed down. Wow. And then I thought, "Wouldn't it be cool if there were quotes from all her favorite authors?" So I... Who are you? You can't just go to a store? - That's too much. - It's not a kidney. But, you know, we would've done that, too. Thanks, guys. ♪ ♪ You know you want ♪ You know you want ♪ You know you want ♪ To come on down ♪ To come on down ♪ Follow no leader ♪ Don't follow him, don't follow her ♪ ♪ Don't follow me ♪ There's a van, and it's, like, some sort of courier service, and they take the evidence from the station to the lab, right? So we wait till this guy makes a stop, and we snag ourselves a pen cap. I can sense you have some questions. Well, how do you know it hasn't already been sent? On "SVU," they don't send the evidence until they have something to match it to. But that's not what they do on "CSI." What do they do? Well, the lab is their office, you know, so they just... Yeah, but that show's been on for so many seasons, that could've changed. I'm telling you, that cap's not going anywhere until you give your sample. Or I could just go down to the station, throw you all under the bus, and cut myself a sweet deal. - Yeah, please. - As if.

Hey, you know, honestly, it's an honor just to be nominated. Busy day? I picked up Sara's homework. By the way, I talked to Miss Allegra about the spring play again. She wants to do "Lion King," fine, but I'll be damned if our son is playing a shrub. Hmm. How's tomorrow looking? Well, I have 300 doughnuts to dip for Rotary Club.
