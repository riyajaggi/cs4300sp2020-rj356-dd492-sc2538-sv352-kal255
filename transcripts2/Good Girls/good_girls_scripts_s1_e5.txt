I dropped the kids off at school, and I went straight to the bar. - Where was your husband? - Screwing his secretary and losing all our money. - Fair enough. - We drank a little. And I invited him back to my house. We drank a little more. And then I realized that what I was doing was insane. And I told him to go. And he kissed me. I kissed him back. He pulled my panties down, and we screwed right on the kitchen table, on the breakfast dishes. The kids had pancakes. Blueberry. If you were wondering.
