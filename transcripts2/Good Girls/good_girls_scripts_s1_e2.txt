 this kind of money on hand? - Because it's hella shady! - We didn't know you owned the store. - You just gonna pay me back, is all. And right quick, too. With interest. - How many chicks have a tramp stamp that says, "All you need is love?" Cops came around, but I didn't tell them. - What do you want? - I just get so lonely. - Stop, my sister is here. No! [grunts] - That's how you like it, right, tough girl?

 - Get off of her! - Whoa, hey. - Boomer. Boomer, please. We can get you money. - Oh, no. I'm turning you in. - [screams] [thuds] - [screams] - Oh, no! [both screaming] - Is he... - No. - Are you sure? [Dena Deadly's "Hello Sunshine"] * - Mama. * Mama. * Mom! The TV's broke. - Broken. Uh, and no it's not. Um... - When's Daddy coming home? - Just hit, uh, input twice, and satellite, and menu. - I need help with math. - [sighs] Why can't I help you? - 'Cause you can't do math. - Papa, he-a gotta the donuts! [children shouting] - Yay! - Hi, guys! Hey, grab your bags. Quick, quick, quick, quick. This train's a-leaving the station-a. - Fun dad. - Sad dad. I miss my kids. - You've been gone two nights. * - I miss you. - Kenny goes to sleepaway camp for longer. Let's keep it together. - What about the lawn? - I can push a mower. - At least let me show you the remote. - Input, satellite, menu. - That's not even close. - I'll get there. - You got a little, uh... On your face. It kinda looks like blood. - Uh, no, it's pizza. Go. Don't leave the kids alone. * - * People always moving fast * * And never get the chance to stop * * Hey hey hey * Waiting for the day to pass * * And looking at the clock tick tock * * It never lasts * All I need to win the day * Is shining in the big blue sky * * Ooh la la la la la la * * Ooh la la la la la la * - Hey. What's with the fuzz? - We got robbed, yo. Get woke. - Yeah, but isn't that, like, old news? - They had guns, Annie. I threw my neck out. - Must have been really scary. - In my job, the key is to think of yourself as already dead so there's nothing left to be afraid of. - Wow. - Hey, have you seen Boomer? - Why? - The cops wanna talk to him again, but he never came in for his shift. - No, I haven't seen him. [suspenseful music] * - They're looking for him. - Do they know he's missing? - I don't know. - Or is it just about the robbery? - I don't know! - What did you tell them? - That you bashed his head in with a whiskey bottle. What do you think I told them? - So, I got $18 in tips. I had to sell Stan's favorite set of cufflinks for $250. Sara is playing her first soccer game in a T-shirt instead of the team uniform. Which gives us a grand total of $343. Which means we now owe $59,657 to the violent street gang. Please tell me you did better. What's going on? - There's been a development. - What kind of development? What am I looking at right now? What am I even looking at right now? - [screams] [grunts] [wailing] - He knows about the store. - He was going to the cops. - Does he know about the gang, too? - Hell no. That's way above his pay grade. He's like the definition of middle management. Oh, and he also tried to rape me. - What? - That is absolutely true. - He's a dick and a rapist. - It was self-defense. - Self-defense. - Definitely. - Yes. - How is hogtying a man, climbing him 12 feet above the earth, and hiding him in a treehouse self-defense? - Okay, you know what? You weren't there. - You're damn right, I wasn't there. - We are feeding him. - Oh, good. Well, you know. - What else were we supposed to do? If he goes to the cops, we're screwed. - No, we're screwed because of the gang that is going to kill us if we don't get them their money. - Okay, she's right. First things first. - Okay, well, I make $9 an hour, so just give me a couple decades. - Okay, who do we know? - To rob? - To ask for money, Annie. - Somebody rich who would care if I was dead? I mean, I wish. What? Who? No. - What do you mean, "No?" - I mean, "No." No, no, no. - Annie, this is life or death. - I choose death. Give me death! [rock music plays] * Which one of these houses is your dad's? - How come you never remember? - 'Cause all these cheesy-ass houses look the same. - It's that one. - Oh. * - Oh, oh. Hey, Nance. [laughs] [brakes squeaking] [sighs] Why is she always in scrubs? Isn't she, like, a facialist or something? - Aesthetician. - [clicks tongue] All right. Let's do this. - Um, would you mind taking your shoes off? Uh, we're trying to keep it cleanish in here. Hey, how do you feel about tacos? We could do a little cheese, a little pico de gallo - Yeah, I feel good. - Oh, yay! Fun! Okay, uh, I am off to work. - Good luck saving lives. - [laughs] Love you. - Love you. - What you making? Pico de gallo? - Yeah. - Um... I have sort of a favor to ask. - How much? - Just, like, 60. - All right. - Grand. It'll be more like a loan this time. I'll totally pay you back. - What is the matter with you? - It's not like you can't afford it. Look at this place. There's orchids everywhere. You have an in-ground pool. - What do you need that much money for? - For a very good reason. - You, uh, hire a lawyer yet? - Do you actually think I would ask you for money to fight you for custody? - Are ya? - I wasn't, but now that you're accusing me of it, maybe I should. So, can I have the money? - No, you freak! - Why do you have to be such a dick? - Because you're insane. I mean, you never think anything through. This is exactly why Nancy and I should have custody, because you are not stable. - Yeah, because who cares about real love and connection when you can make a child a fresh pico de gallo? - Why do you keep saying that? - Thank you for making me completely humiliate myself for no reason. These are cold. - They're not mine. - Eww. [spits] What do we do now? - I have no idea. [Patti & The Emblems' "Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl"] * Am I crying because I'm happy * - What is it? - Are you okay? - Stay here. - * Or am I crying because I'm blue without you * * Yeah yeah [dramatic music] * - I've got a question for you. The two, two, and two meal deal, How much is that? - $7.95. - Yeah, see, but if I order two hot cakes, two sausages, and two eggs a la carte, it's cheaper. * - You get a garnish. - Like parsley or something? [laughing] * - It's an orange slice. - You tell the owner that ain't right? * Cheating people like that? * - We're gonna get you your money. All of it. I swear. - That would be great. - We need more time to get it. * Thank you. - I'll come by tomorrow. 1:00 good for you? Your friend's house. You can subtract the coffee. [foreboding music] * - How much? - $10 for the clubs, $75 for the rest. So, what'd he do? - [sighs] - Eesh. Something bad. - It's real sterling. - $50. You can keep the picture. - Okay, I have to take home at least two grand for all of this. - Okay. - It was his great grandmother's. - How much do you hate him? [knocking] - Mr. Boland? Mr. Martin is here inquiring about the 2015 Mustang. - Oh, okay. - Hi. - Hey, how you doing? - Good, how are you? - Everything's good. - So, uh, what are you driving now? - A 2007 Celica G.T. - Ooh, the 'Stang's quite an upgrade. Fully loaded. I mean, she handles like a dream. - She's gorgeous. - Yeah, right? [laughs] - My Celica's been good to me, but she's pushing 100,000 miles, so... - She's dependable. - Sad to see her go, but... I think it's time to change things up a bit. - I thought the exact same thing. - I'm sorry? - You know, you see something shiny and new and you just forget about what you got. Once you upgrade, those memories, they come back and they-- they haunt you. You know like, uh, road trip with the kids. - Oh, I don't have kids. - The fun stuff you did in the backseat in high school. - I haven't had it that long, so... - The crazy thing is, you thought you were the one sick of her, and now you'd do anything to get her back. - You--you do sell cars here, right? - Don't give up on your Celica. - Maybe... Maybe if we test drove it-- - You'll regret it. - Yeah, uh, okay. [cheering] - Come on, baby. Let's go, let's hustle! - Pace yourself! Don't be a hero! - Run, baby! Get the ball! - You want some water? Time out! Time out! Water break! - [groaning] She needs water. - Come on, girls. Get back in the game. - Excuse me? Can we keep it together please? - She shouldn't overdo it. - She's doing great. She's fine. Look at her. - Yeah, I see. And what about when we can't afford that damn truck anymore? What happens then? - Cops get real good insurance. - You're not a cop yet. - Yeah, I will be. - Yeah, in six months, babe. - Okay. Okay, look. I know you're not used to this. - Used to what? - Neither am I. I mean, we haven't been here in a long time. - What are you talking about? - This. Right here, right now. It's what winning feels like, babe. Our girl's strong enough to run and play in the sunshine for the first time in years. I don't know about you, but I'm gonna drink in this moment. - Fine, drink up. - Oh, I'm gonna need a little bit more than that. - Excuse me? - I'm gonna need you to say it. - You're crazy. - Say it with me. We are winning. - We're winning. - Yeah, I'm sure you can do a lot better than that. - We are winning. - Mean it. Come on, baby. - We're winning. - Yes, that's what I'm talking about! - We're winning! - Yes! Come on, baby! Let's go! We're winning, baby! We are winning! Let's go! We are winning! - No, we're not! - I'm sorry, baby. I know. I know, just stay focused, baby! Stay focused. - We are winning. - Get back inside, coach. My bad. Stay in the game, baby. Stay in the game. [melancholy music] * - That's $13. - You know what? This is some bull right here. Them coming at us with guns, dropping by my job, uh-uh. We have families. We have children. We have lives. And we gotta end this now. - Great. How? - The way I see it, we got two issues we need to take care of. One is your boy up in that tree house. - Excuse me, he's not my boy. - And the money. - Yeah, so two birds, one stone. Y'all are already getting charged for kidnapping. We might as well ransom his ass, too. . - [slurping] [grunts] Just let me go already. - Yeah, so you can run to the cops? - It's not like you're gonna kill me. - And how do you know? - 'Cause you don't have the guts. You're not killers. You're just a dumb checkout girl. And you're, what, a housewife? Thought you'd pull a fast one? Hmm? Make a quick buck? Now you guys are freaking out because you are in way over your head. - Just shut up. - Only reason I'm up here is 'cause you don't know what to do with me. - Just shut up! - You have no idea. 'Cause girls like you, you never think things through. - No, he's right. You do do this. I mean, you've done this your whole life. I mean, you make these big messes, and then you just expect everyone else to clean it up. And then you just ignore it. For hours. Hours become days, and days become weeks. - Yes, and weeks sometimes turn into months. You're so right. I do do that. Mmm. Fatal flaw. - You can't leave me here forever. - Oh, we wouldn't mean to. - No, right, but like you said, we don't have the guts to kill you. And it's just we're in so far over our heads, I feel like it's gonna take us a really, really long time to figure out what to do with you. - And by then, the animals or just Michigan winter would probably would probably just take care of it for us. * - I'm just a dumb checkout girl. - And I'm just an idiot housewife. - His grandma's loaded. - And she doesn't trust banks, so she keeps all of her cash at home like Scrooge McDuck. - Where should we have her bring it? - Well, they always do the drop in a park in "Law & Order," so how about Beeman? - All right, check out this app I downloaded onto his phone. [beeps] - We have your grandson. Deliver $60,000 to Beeman Park by 5 p.m., or he's dead. - Is that Sean Connery? - No, it's just Scottish Man. Here. - Sounds hot. - What about... - [high-pitched voice] We have your grandson. Deliver $60,000-- - No, no. - She wouldn't get that. - Okay, uh, let's see here. - [robot voice] We have your grandson. Deliver $60,000 to Beeman Park by 5 p.m., or he's dead. - That's good. - Yeah? - I think that's good. - Yeah. - All right. Whew, okay. [phone trilling] - You've reached Marion Petersen. I'm not home right now. Please leave a message. - Try later. [The Girls' "Psycho"] - You've reached Marion Petersen. - * Baby - You've reached Marion Petersen. I'm not home right-- * - You've reached Marion-- - [groans] - I'm not home-- - Marion, where you at? - [sighs] - * I wish I was dead - I mean, if she's out for the night... * - Everyone has to use their own toothbrush. And no one goes in the backyard tonight. We just sprayed for bugs, and it's covered in very toxic chemicals. I won't be late. I just have a thing with my sister and a friend. - Oh, a girls night. - Yeah. [Haiku Hands' "Not About You"] - * I'm gonna tear up the lexicon * * With a hexagon and my sexy thong on * * No matter where your head is gone * * Or where you're from, I'ma take you on * * It's not about you - Ugh, of course. It's a security door. We don't have a code. - All right, will you just be cool? - I hate it when you say that. - This is so much easier than the grocery store. She's not even home. - Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. - * It's not about you * Shut up It's not about me either * * I am my sister's keeper * Chill * It's not about you * Shut up It's not about me either * * It's us verse the grim reaper * * Chill chill chill * You look like a tortoise Your issues are enormous * * In my eyes you're flawless I'm gonna share my cake * * Whoo * It's time to drop - You're gonna rake through with the tumblers. - Go back to the part with the second pin thingie. - I'm trying. - Stop flipping it around. Just hold it one... - What is taking so long? - It's buffering. - That unlimited data plan sounds real nice right about now, doesn't it? - Can I help you? - Marion! You're up and about! That's great! We were told that you would be bedridden and to just let ourselves in. - Who are you? - We're the volunteers. Medicare automatically enrolls you to receive a number of services. Tidying up, meal prep, companionship, whatever you need. Should we come back another time? Or is this a bad time? - Well, I suppose not. - You are an incredible liar. - Right? - Thank you. - * It's not about you * Shut up * It's not about you . [calm music] * - Got any family in town, Marion? - My husband passed last year. - I'm so sorry. - Such is life. We had 40 years. Five children. Sixteen grandchildren. - Wow, that must keep you busy. - Every one of them moved away. Can you believe that? They're just too into their own lives. Except Leslie. He's my little boy. [laughs] Oh, and this is his fiancee. Isn't she pretty? - Very. Jessica Alba? - I know what you're thinking, but she's only half. How about some of this no-calorie lemonade? - Marion, where's your restroom? - Oh. [chain pulling] - [grunts] [chain pulling] - [screams] [chugging] - [screaming] [Toto's "Africa"] - * It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you * - Help me! - * There's nothing that a hundred men or more * * Could ever do * I bless the rains down in Africa * * Gonna take some time to do the things we never had * * Ooh * * It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you * * There's nothing that a hundred men or more * * Could ever do... [unsettling music] * [cell phone buzzes] - Are the kids okay? - Yeah, they're fine. [indistinct chatter] - No, it's input, satellite, some-- You know what? Tell them there is no TV. It's too late. - Okay, but the kids are-- - No, what--what-- Wait, wait. What's that noise? - No, that noise. Where's that coming from? [vacuum whirring] - Be sure that you really get back in that corner, now. [vacuum whirring] - You gonna make the white girl clean something? Or does she just get to eat? - Mmm, Doug looks so skinny here. Oy, Gloria. Are you ever not pregnant? [laughs] Right here, hand me the-- - We've gotta go. Now. - Sorry, Marion. You didn't take it? - I told you, Dean is in my backyard. I can't do this. - No, we're doing it. Stop. - Why didn't you take the money? - I couldn't do it. - You couldn't rob the sweet old racist lady? - She had this life. She had this full life that she loved. Come on, we're robbing lonely old people? This is who we are now? - What we are is screwed because you choked. - Beth! We needed that money! - I know. I'm sorry. I gotta go. - Okay, yeah, we'll just talk about this tomorrow when we're all dead! [sighs] - I told you not to mow the lawn. - Well, good thing I did, 'cause guess what I found back there? - What? - Moles. Those tiny little rat thingies that build tunnels. We got them, like, really bad. - No, I have them. I have the moles. - Okay. - In my backyard. In my house that I paid the mortgage for, and am perfectly capable of handling all the aspects of. Including the lawn. And the remote control. And-- - What happened to your ring? - I took it off. - For how long? - I don't know. - Oh. You can throw chewed-up bubble gum into the mole hole and... They'll choke and die. - That's terrible. - I know. - Dean? Thank you. - It's the middle of the night. - I'm making lasagna. - In the middle of the night? - You have to reheat at 350, okay? - What, do you plan on going somewhere? - Where would I be going? - You tell me. You don't wanna act like you're not gonna be around to feed us no more. - Oh. An island sounds good. - Oh. Island. With one of those huts, mmm. Where you could see the ocean through the floor. - Hmm, yeah. - [laughs] I might come. - I'm sorry, it's my imaginary island. - An island for what? - I mean, you can make conjugal visits. - [laughs] [kisses] [sighs] Hey. [stammers] You'd tell me if something was going on, right? - Baby... - Yes? - I'm just making lasagna. [kisses] - Why don't you come on back to bed? And bring some of that sauce with you. [both laughing] [somber music] * - Where were you? * - Oh, honey, it's so late. Why aren't you in bed? - I woke up, and you were gone. - Where was Kristen? - She's always sexting her boyfriend. * - It's scary when you wake up and I'm gone, huh? * Well, there's something you need to know about mommies. Sometimes they go away. But guess what? - What? - They always come back. No matter what. Okay? * Come on. * Did Kristen teach you that word? Sexting? - Mm-hmm. * - Well, I'm glad I gave her a raise. * - Um, she sleeps with a nightlight. - What? - Sadie. She sleeps with a nightlight, okay? - She's 11 years old. - Yes, I know that. That's why you just turn it on and you walk out of the room so you don't embarrass her. - What time is it? - And she doesn't like to swallow pills, so you have to make sure that you get her the gummy vitamins, okay? - Wha--what are you doing here? - And she's gonna need to start wearing a bra soon, so don't get her anything too girly. Just get her something like tank tops or something so that she can have them layered. - Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie. - I'm not gonna fight you for custody. - Seriously? Why--why not? - Because I'm dealing with some stuff. And... I just can't. And she's a kid, you know. - Uh-huh. - So don't make her take off her shoes in her own house. . - How much is there? - Same as yesterday. - Costa Rica? - Bugs. - We cannot run. We have families. - All right. China. - Earthquakes. - That's your big issue with China? - You have a better problem with China? - [scoffs] Language barrier, human rights violations, communistic rule. - We're staying here, and we are facing this. - Air pollution. Swine flu. I mean-- - They don't have Indian food. I need to go someplace where they have Indian food. - India? - God, no. - Who keeps IM'ing you? - Oh, I put Hans up on ebay. - Who's Hans? - The little drummer boy I stole from Boomer's granny. - Annie, that is an heirloom. - Who's she gonna pass it down to? Alba? Or her only one quarter Mexican grandchildren? [beeping] - Holy mother. - What? - Hans is up to eight g's. - What? - Shut the front door. - Did you take anything else? - You're short. - No, we're not. - Yeah, you are. - Actually... We're over. See, these are super rare collectables. - Treasures. - Yes, sister, you are correct. That's a better word for these. Because these super rare treasures go for 10 to 15 g's on ebay. How much leg work is there, right? But the truth is, it's very little. Because we have done the lion's share of the work for you. Ruby? - These are the usernames and passwords for our ebay accounts. Plus auction tips to maximize your profits. - You want me to sell your dolls? - Tell him about Hans. - Ooh, our little drummer boy. The pride of Hamburg. [laughs] You see, Hans here is one of only 12 in the entire-- [shatters] all: [screaming] 11 in the world. - This some kind of joke to you? I'm done playing with you guys. [shattering] - [screams] What are they doing? - Making it look like a home invasion. - So they can kill us? - Please don't do this! - Wait, please, wait! We can get you the money, I swear! Please! - We have families! - Please! - We have kids! [both crying and screaming] - Please, don't! [crying] [suspenseful music] * - You're an idiot. - [crying] Beth! * - What, are you gonna blow our brains out all over the room? 'Cause that's how it works, right? Someone shorts you, and they get tossed out like trash? And no one cares, and no one even notices. Your problem this time is that's not us. We're normal people. * We pay our taxes and... * We take our kids to P.F. Chang's, and we take orange slices to soccer games. * And when bad things happen to good people, everyone else goes crazy. It's all over the news. And there are all these hashtags and movements. Because if it could happen to us, it could happen to anyone. So if you wanna invite all that attention over a few grand, then you're not the smart businessman you think you are. Now, roll the dice. Tell him to pull the trigger. * See what happens. * - Please, please. * Oh, my God. * [heavy breathing] - [crying] Sweet Jesus. [creaking] [kicking] This was my favorite sangria bowl. - Well, it could have been your face. - L'chaim. To life. - Dude. [kicking] - Hey, it looks like we got a survivor. [kicking] [grunting] [laughs] [grunts] - Split three ways, it's two weeks plus overtime. - [grunts] [tense music] . - Would you go faster? - I'm going the speed limit. - Are you joking? - I'm not gonna get a ticket. - Why, you don't wanna mar your perfect record of armed robbery and kidnapping? - I mean, he couldn't have gone that far. His hands are tied. - I don't know. I mean, remember that Gulf War vet on our block growing up? He ran marathons with both his arms blown off. - How is that helpful? - You brought it up! Damn, that was amazing, though. - I mean, can we just find this guy? - Yes, I'm trying! - Then what? We shove him back up in the treehouse? Like Rapunzel? - Oh, there he is! - Where does he think he's going? - Oy, this is hard to watch. - Oh, okay. - Oof. - All right, I got this. - Wait, what are you gonna do? - I got this. - [groans] [crying, panting] - [scoffs] Okay. - Wait, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you-- What are you doing? - She's gonna cut his penis off. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - She's gonna cut his penis off! - There we go. - [screams] What-- - Yikes. - [groaning] - Mmm-hmm. Oh! [camera shutter clicks] - What are you doing? - Texing a picture of your penis. - Why are you doing that? - Actually, you're doing it. It's your phone. - And there. Sent. To my daughter. Who is 11. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Oh, yeah. - Wait, why? - Well, because now, if you go to the cops, so will I. Have a nice night. - Wait, wait! No! - I don't get it. What did she do? [cell phone rings] - Oh. Oh, hell no. - [giggles] - Really? - [laughs] - You're a sick, sick woman. - It's true. - Will someone tell me what happened? - I mean, it was either you or my 11-year-old. You know? - Hostage peen. - [laughs] - Can we go? - Told you I had it. [Monarchs' "Come On and Move Me"] - * Stepped into the garden after midnight * * For a taste of some white light * * Like I had had before * * Talked to the master at the prayer gate * * Sat at his feet and his stone cape * * And tried to breathe his theme * * I was ready to move I was ready to move * * Come on come on and move me * * * We met and shared a bottle at the J.Clyde * * I liked his mind I liked his sweet smile * * And things were fresh and new * * * That summer night he led me to the river * * After the swim I sat and shivered * * I waited for the kiss * I was ready to move I was ready to move * * Come on come on and move me * - Feeling good, feeling strong. I'm taking requests. - Minions! - TV on. Streaming box on. Input one. Two. Arrow up, arrow left. Select. Select. Select. all: Yay! - [laughs] - Where's your brother? - Outside. * - ...And gave one half to Kyle. Kyle kept eight of the Jujubes and gave the last ten to Kim. How many Jujubes did Jen take from Sam? - 36. You know how many she'd have taken if Sam had a gun, though? - How? - Zero. - Whoa. - Kenny, go inside. - I don't wanna. - Now. - But your friend's helping me. - Stop with the homework and go inside and watch TV. Now. - Listen to Mama, Kenny. - You know you should really get him a tutor, right? - You want the rest of the money? We'll get it. - No, let's forget all that. - Then why are you here? [Santigold's "Disparate Youth"] - I keep thinking about what you said. About being a basic bitch and whatnot. - That's not exactly what I said. - Maybe there's something you could help me out with. * - What's that? - You ladies got passports? - * Don't look ahead There's stormy weather * * * Another roadblock in our way * * * But if we go we go together * * * Oh we said our dreams will carry us * * And if we don't fly we will run * * Now we push right past to find out * * Or either win what they have lost *
