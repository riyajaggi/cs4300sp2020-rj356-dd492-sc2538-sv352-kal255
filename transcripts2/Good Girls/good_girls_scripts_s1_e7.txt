I know a task force means a little longer hours, but Detroit's gonna appreciate it big time when we put these guys away, so let's get started. If you all would turn to page four of your hymnals. ♪ [knocking] - Open up. [locks click] [shivers] What? - We just didn't think you'd show. - Please. I'm stuck with you guys. - Good. 'Cause we need you. - Where the hell would I go anyway? - I don't know, the diner would probably take you back. - Ugh. There's no going back. Ever tell you guys about the sauce? I don't think I've even told Stan. You gotta swear-- - Promise. - Ride or die. [clicks tongue] - So for a while, the diner was running this Italian sub deal. Salami with peppers and onions and special sauce. To save money, Tony orders a 55-gallon barrel. We kept it in the basement. It was so damn hot down there. The heat would cause the oils to separate. We'd use this wood canoe paddle to stir it back together. Eventually the paddle breaks. And you know cheap-ass Tony, he's not gonna buy a new paddle. You tell yourself you'd never do something. - Wasn't there a ladle you could use or something? - A broom even? - Just my arm. I had the longest. So every day, twirling in these sauce oils like a conductor for the New York Phil. Then one morning, I get a paper cut opening the mail. Whatever, I go about my day. I'm elbow deep in sauce, and when I pull out my arm, my Band-Aid's gone. - [shivering] No. - Yeah. I can't tell Tony. His cheap-ass isn't gonna buy another barrel. - Oh, my God. - Six months go by. This sub deal is still a hit. One day, a customer comes up to Tony, opens up his sub, and in the middle of those peppers and onions is my Band-Aid. Are you crying? - It's just so gross, I... [whispers] I can't. - You never have to go back there, okay? - [groans] We got you. And, hey. You know you're our blood. - You know that, right? - I love you guys. [children yelling, cart rattling] Mary Pat on your two. - Hey, get in the car. [children chattering] That's good. Thank you. Thank you, guys. - Okay, everyone's all buckled in. - Thank you. Thank you. So much. Wow. Thank you so much for the help. I really appreciate it. - $10,000. - Yeah, that too. - ♪ I let a stranger in my bed ♪ - It's all there. - [laughs] - ♪ 'Cause I needed to feel wanted ♪ - So we're good now, right? ♪ - Yeah. Yeah, we're good. - ♪ I gotta find another way ♪ - Till next month. - Excuse me? - Whoa, I thought this was a one-time deal. - Yeah, I--I mean, I thought I was a secret shopper. - ♪ Another way - Bye. ♪ - ♪ I'm trying to be better ♪ I'm learning again ♪ But I don't know if I'm a giver ♪ ♪ I don't know if I'm a giver ♪ ♪ ♪ I got so much soul in my body ♪ ♪ But no one keeping me honest ♪ ♪ And whole days turn into holes in my mind ♪ ♪ I got high hopes, lots of potential ♪ ♪ I'm high, broke, searching for symbols ♪ ♪ And I will not let go of what is mine ♪ ♪ I'm learning to live ♪ I'm trying to be better ♪ I'm learning to give ♪ But I don't know if I'm a giver ♪
