Yeah, you closed for business. - But you took all of it. - So? - So part of that was our cut! We worked our asses off for that money! - What do you want me to say? It's a company-wide shutdown. And if I got closing costs, everybody feels the pain. - You can't just mess with people's lives like that! - You want to know what I can't do?

Go back to working like dogs and barely scraping by? - I guess we go legit for a while. - [sighs] - So the dogs and the scraping. - I like the word "legit" better.

How much? - Uh, about 8,000 bucks. - Seriously? Wow, that's federal level. - You know, um, I was really counting on it, too. And they left me a little bit, but not nearly enough to get through my bills and everything. Come on, Mister, you're making this much harder than it needs to be. Does anybody have any hand sanitizer, or... - You need me to hold something else for you-- - No, it's just, like, really caked on here for some reason, give me your hand. - Maybe it was a misunderstanding, the money in your mail thing. - You know, I don't think so, 'cause I feel like I was pretty clear. Yes, I was, wasn't I? Mama was so clear. - Hey, that make you want to try for a third? - Hey, um, what if I think I know who did it? - Could file a report. - Oh, can I do that with you? - Yeah, sure, come on down to the station. - Super. - Yeah. - I just might do that. - Come on, now, let's bring it home!

He's not Dean. - No, he's a good person. - He's a cop, you guys! He'll leave me so fast he'll leave tread marks. - Then we've got to get her her money. - How? I'm working seven days a week, doubles and graveyards, and I still can't afford all the multiple genres of lawyers. - You don't have to tell me! - I hate to say it... - Wow. - What else are we gonna do? - I'm just surprised that you want to rob something again. - I don't want to. - But you don't not want to. - I want to stay ahead of a bad situation, and I'm not just talking about the Mary Pat thing. - Every cent I saved went towards those damn hospital bills. - Exactly, and my mortgage is paid now, but what about next month? - So what are we talking about here? [suspenseful music] - I was thinking something kind of low-stress, like a 7/11. - I can get behind that. - Except for the one on Lynwood, because I got him to sponsor the school. - Good for you. - Well, I'm out. - You're out? - It's just not a good time for me to get back into crime. - Well, can we sync up iCals so I know when is? - I'm facing a felony drug charge!

Harry Potter style? - Well, not all of it's mine. - Damn it. - Uh-uh. Keep talking. - Kendall sells the makeup. Madison does the candy. And I... I move the fidget spinners. - You stole fidget spinners? - She moved them, Stan. Our child moves the fidget spinners! - All right. Easy, now. - Our child speaks the language of the streets! - Why? Baby, why would you do that? - The other girls do it all the time. - So if they jumped off a high-rise, you would do it? Ran across a busy freeway? - Mom-- - Robbed a bank? - Okay, okay. - Just because other girls do crazy, stupid-ass stuff doesn't make it okay. You wouldn't do those things, so why in the hell would you do this? - They used to make fun of the oxygen tank weirdo. [melancholy music] Now, they don't. I'm dope. - Stealing doesn't make you dope, Sara. It just makes you a dope. - She's right, you a dope! Now, go to your bedroom, I need to talk to your mom. Now. [sighs] You really need to get ahold of yourself, you're scaring her. - Good. - Babe, she messed up, okay? Agreed. - She didn't just mess up; she's a criminal. - Strong word. - Right word. - I'm just saying, you know, we gotta keep a level head here. - You're a cop, for God's sake. - Yeah, and before that, I was mall security, and I saw kids do this stuff all the time. Okay, it's just a phase, baby. - Phases become habits, habits become problems. And then suddenly, our little girl's giving handies on the street for a fidget spinner! - Oh my God. You gotta breathe, okay? Just, with me, now, take a deep breath. - She's gotta return everything, all of it! - No doubt. - Apologize to the store owner. - She'll do that. - Write letters to the teachers, she's gonna wash the dishes for at least a month, maybe six, she's gonna do the leaves! - We will do whatever it takes, just-- - Yeah. - We will do whatever it takes. - Yeah, we will. - Oh, hi. - Who is it? - It's carol singers! - It's a CD on a boombox. It doesn't even sound like real carolers. - Just suspend your disbelief. ["Silent Night" plays in movie] - Not to state the obvious here, but, uh, you're aware that's your best friend's wife, right, dude? What? - Mom! - I'm just saying. Extremely wonderful cue cards or not, he's a scumbag, and he shouldn't be hitting on her. - Well, I mean, she's not innocent either. She kisses him. - You guys are maybe the worst people to watch a movie with. I'm gonna go do homework. ["Silent Night" continues] - [sighs] How you been? - Fine. You? - Fine. - Great. - What's new at work? - Nothing much. - Got me peeing into a cup. - That sucks. - Yeah. Hey, you know what else sucks? - Hmm? - Supervised visits with my own child. - It's not my fault. - Nothing ever is, is it? ♪ - Look, if you want to talk about it, we should just talk about it. - What do you want to talk about, Greg? - You know what I want to talk about. I want to talk about what happened. If you want to talk about it, let's talk about it like adults. - [scoffs] Please. Why start now? - Because this is-- Hey. - Oh my God, did you get to the cue card scene yet? Ugh, I love that part. - I bet you do. - Yeah, apparently, quite controversial. - Really? Oh, I wish I didn't have to go to work. - Ugh, is there a zit only you can pop? - [giggles] Actually, we just opened a third location. It's crazy, but I love helping women feel good about themselves, so... If you want, I could help you with that little divot in your forehead there, just... [smacks lips] One shot. - I'm good. - Okay. Oh, actually, um... Do you mind not leaning all the way back on the couch? Sorry, I know it's weird, it's just, um, your-- Your hair oils, they tend to get on the pillows. - I'm sorry? - I noticed it last week when you were here. It's this-- it's this stupid fabric. It is impossible to clean. Yeah. Normally, I would never say anything, it's just the covers and the shams, they're--they're new. - It's just 'cause they're new. - Yeah, we just bought them. - Mm. - Okay, well, have so much fun, you guys. - Mm-hmm. - I love you, Mister Man. - [sighs] - I love you too! Okay. Bye! [knocking on door] - Do you know what time it is? - It's show time, baby. Hey, have you ever heard of hair oils? Is that like a thing people say?

I can't find your K-cups! - Maybe it's the universe saying you've had enough. - [gasps] ♪ Dark magic - You know! So won't Nancy see us? - No, I signed her up to be Sadie's chaperone on a field trip. So, okay, check it. All three mall locations have the exact same layout, so I figure we split up, and we hit them all simultaneously, you know? Just like, boom, boom, boom! - Hang on, boom, boom, boom. What happened to "I have a felony drug charge?" - Well, if we don't use guns, is it even really a crime? - Yeah. - Or... Is it a gentle redistribution of wealth? - Plus, Nance has it coming. - So, wait, how do we get past security if we don't have guns? - These places don't have security, they don't even have cameras. - No cameras? - It's a spa. Everybody's naked, yo! - So? - So I was thinking more along the lines of an ATM. But suck it, Nance! - Suck it, Nance! ["She's Got Guns" by The Go!

She has good role models. - Yeah, right. - You ready to see how this works? - Do I have to? - She's ready. - You like bunk beds, Sara? - Oh, she's been begging us for bunk beds. Is that right? - I want you to think of this as an opportunity to grow during the downtime.

I mean, it's literally liquid, but... - It's garbage. This stuff's poison. - Not any more so than the substances your guys deal. - Who would I even sell it to? - Don't you know someone? - That rolls with a bunch of middle-aged ladies? Nah, man, not so much. How's your rotten egg? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You said you handled it. - I did. - Then why you trying to play me with this side-hustle stuff? I told you, we're shut down. - And I told you I have expenses. I have four children, a mortgage, I can't just shut down-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. She got you on the hook, now, right? - I said I'm handling it! - Okay. [laughs] You think you're a boss, now, huh? Your lily ass does two jobs and all of the sudden, you think you run the whole game? Let me tell you something, you ain't no boss. And on the real, you ain't gonna be nothing till you get your house in order. And you best not put that stuff in your face. You don't need it. - When you're in my house, you mind your business. You're sharing your space with gang bangers, murderers, people you don't want to mess with, let alone sleep next to. - So they just put everyone in all together? There's not like a separate white collar cell? - One big melting pot. - You okay, Mom? - Yeah, you know, it's just hot in here. - You got chow at 7:00, clean up at 7:30, and then, you gotta shower. - And what does she shower in? - A group. You make a circle, then rotate under the shower head. - No, I meant, like, shower shoes? - Your shoes are your shower shoes. You don't want to get them wet? You take your chances with the fungi, and don't expect hot water neither. - And what if she has to, um, use the-- - There's your bathroom, your kitchen, your sink, everything. - Wait, so people just go right there? Like, in front of everybody? Even number-- - All the numbers. And most of the time, there won't be toilet paper. - Okay.

[laughs] Welcome home! - Okay, we gotta get out of here. - No can do! It's not rec time. - Oh my God, let me out of here! - Hey, how was your day? - Has our credit rebounded enough to qualify for a loan? - Well, we put a dent in our debt, that's for sure. - Yes or no? - No. Look, I know you don't want to tell me what's going on. - I need cash fast. - How much? - 10 grand. - Does that have anything to do with the many vials of liquid hashish I just saw in the garage? - It's not liquid hashish. - Oh, well... [clears throat] What is it then? Why don't you let me help you? - I don't know that you can. - Maybe not, but what do you got to lose? [suspenseful music] - Mr. Boland, I don't have you down for an appointment today. - Hey, got a minute? - I'm with a patient. - It's slow-growing. You'll be fine. How's that Buick treating you? - Fine. - You know any dermatologists? - I can't believe it was all three! You know, like, I would get it if it was just one, you know? But... Oh, God... - Hey. Want some more water? - I'm just... What are we gonna do? I mean, 'cause I just... Oh, no, um... Of course. Yeah. Sure. Um... Thank you for letting me know. Yeah, you too.

Do I look like a total raccoon right now? - No. You look great. - Oh my God, it's like-- Ugh, it's these hormones. I'm, like, shooting up like a junkie. And for nothing, because apparently, I only make these, like, crappy unicorn embryos with, like, horns or something. - How long have you been trying? - This is, like, our fourth round, or like, fifth, I honestly-- I can't even keep track it's been so... And I literally cannot stop crying. I can't. Stop! Stop! Stop! [somber music] . - You're blocking me in! - You're leaving? Why did you tell me to get extra anchovies? - God. You're a dick. - What? - Just move your car, all right? - Whoa, what the hell's wrong with you? - How long have you been doing IVF? - Oh, God. - Yeah! - I was gonna tell you. - When? Mid-bone? - Oh, gross. - You were having sex with me while your wife was injecting herself full of baby hormones! - I didn't plan on it, obviously, it just, kind of-- happened, you were there! - No, a solar eclipse just happens! Two people decide to sleep with each other! - What am I supposed to do? Leave her and marry you? We tried that, it didn't work, remember? What do you want me to do, Annie? - I want you to move your car. [sighs] - Door's open! Come in! Okay, guys, ten more minutes, okay? And then, it's homework time. [baby fussing] Hey. Is it all there this time? - It's all there. - Can you hand-- Thanks. I'm not an evil person, okay? - Okay. - It's just, um, Jeff left me with, like, a mountain of debt, so... I have literally nothing to lose. - Now you do. [baby cries] If we get caught, you're going down, too. I think it's called an accessory. - So why are you doing it? - Same reason. - You sure about that? - Have you ever heard the theory that they always look like daddy when they're born? Some caveman evolution thing, so men know it's theirs, and they don't leave. - Well, this one's Jeff's twin, so... - All four of mine looked exactly like Dean. - Go figure. - Stop it! - Mom, he hit me! - Boys, homework, I swear to God! - Well, you've got your hands full. - Hey, listening ears, you want to put 'em on? It's like I'm not even here. - Imagine if you were in prison. - Hey, Beth? [baby crying] I'll see you next month. [indistinct chatter] - So, uh, hey. You think it worked? - She got her wake-up. - Yeah? [laughs] Well, I'll tell you what-- ooh! Listen, if she is half the woman that I got in front of me right now, she's gonna be something else. - Will you chill? You are at work. - What? Come on, we undercover. We undercover. - So? - Ain't nobody watching. - What's that? - I don't know, the guys busting my chops. - I mean, who's the boy? - Oh. It's that fool we arrested. - That's him? - Mm-hmm. - He's young. - Yeah, he's dumb, too. He's ours, now. - What does that mean? - I don't know, he's part of some gang that the feds got their eye on, and, uh, we put him to work for the good guys. - Cool. Very cool. - That's right. It's all 'cause of your man. - Hey, uh, you mind if I use the shower? Kenny's got, like, a million action figures in the tub, and I keep stepping on them. - Sure. - Thanks. - I'll be--I'll be quick, I promise. - Hey. How'd you unload all that stuff? - Friend of a friend. - Not gonna tell me, huh? - No, I am not. - I probably deserve that. - You don't deserve anything I did to you. - We wash counterfeit money for a gang. We buy stuff with fake cash, and return it for real. We get 12%. But I'm gonna ask for 15% when we're up and running again, because we're smart, and we work hard, and we deserve it. - [scoffs] - Do you think I'm insane? - I think you're incredible.

And you have to go right there in front of everyone. My God! The place is literally for animals. Oh, and drink up, because jail wine-- [gags] jail wine is brewed in a toilet with ketchup and bread! - Bread? - Bread is where I threw you? The toilet you're good with? - The toilet I understand, because have to have somewhere to put the-- - Bread is yeast, so it ferments. We have to tell Rio. - You don't think he knows? - That his boy is talking to the FBI? No way! - If we tell him, he will kill him. I mean, right?
