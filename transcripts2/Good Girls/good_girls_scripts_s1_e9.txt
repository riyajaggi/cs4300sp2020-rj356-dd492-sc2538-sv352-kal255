Parked in a garage off I-75. - What's in it? - Yeah, you ain't got to worry about that. Just go get it, and we're good to go. I thought y'all would be more excited than this. But, hey, if you don't need to get back to work then-- - Oh, we do. We do. - There's something we need to talk about though. - Yeah, uh, none of us drive stick. I mean, everything's automatic, so I just never learned. I don't know about you guys, but... You know what? It'll be fine.

So we're in like Flynn. Where the keys at? [upbeat music] ♪ - We're gonna get pinched the second we pull that thing out of that garage. - Now look who's down with the lingo. - There's no way that kid didn't tell the FBI about a truckload full of God knows what. - And Sara will literally be bumped off the list if we don't get the money. - Wait, seriously? - You have to pay up front before the surgery. - What?

Wait, wait. Maybe we should ask Stan first. - We? - Well, you. - You want me to ask my cop husband if his cop friends have their eye on a truck that's potentially filled with dead bodies. - Well, I would be a little bit more subtle, but that's your call. - [sighs] - [sighs] - You okay? - I mean, just add it to the list of things I'm not okay with. Like taking orders from grown men who go by the names of Bullet, Demon, and Mr. Cisco. - [gasps] Which one is Mr. Cisco? Ew! - [laughing] You are making those names up. - I am not! I saw the one with the skull tattoo call the one with the grill "Mr. Cisco." Now, whether that's a God given name or a nickname I don't know, but he answers to it. - I am truly disturbed. - Yeah, well get in line. - Mr. Cisco is the one to watch. Mark my words.

And I feel so sick about this, but what am I gonna do? You know, I got to feed my kids, right? - Oh, hell no. - Oh, come on.

Restock at register three. - So you don't have like a house account or-- - No. - Um, how about a "You Gave Me Counterfeit Money to Spend" account? Do you have one of those? Or a, um, what are those things called? Um, an "I Can Still Call The Cops on You" account. Maybe? No? All right, well just put the whole thing on the "I'm What's Keeping You Out of Jail" account. We'll just--we'll just call it a day. Sound good? [cash register beeps] You're the best. Thank you so much. Don't forget the candy bar. - I got it. I found it. - Thanks, honey.

I just think maybe I'm not as into crafting as I used to be. - Oh. Well, it's not only for that. It's for your stash. You could put like 1/2 million bucks in there easy.

[water shuts off] - Yeah, that's what they call cancer patients, the lucky ones. - You are making a giant mistake. - You just slept with your ex. - Dude, he cheated on you and almost left you and your family homeless. - In the middle of a custody battle, no less. - I'm sorry, but do you remember what he bought that little skank? - Of course I do. - I'm gonna need you to say it. - Underwear. - Nah. That was not underwear, baby girl. That was bedazzled vagina floss. Okay? And it was horrible and humiliating. And you're starting to forget. - No, I'm not. - Then you're starting to forgive him which is way worse. - Let me worry about it. It's my marriage. - You can't do both. - Both what? - You can't be this sweet little wifey, and then also this like badass criminal boss lady. - I sound like Carmen Sandiego. - You should be so cool. - Can we just go to bed? - Aw, man, all your drama made me have to poop. - Oh, my God.

Yes. - Do it. Okay. - I'm a genius. Okay. - [chuckling] [cell phone ringing] - What's up? - I forgot. - You called me. - I forgot what I was supposed to ask Stan. - Huh? - Literally. What am I supposed to be asking? - Dude, are you faded? - I mean, yeah, he gets chatty when he smokes, so... - [laughing] Well played. - So what am I supposed to be asking? - If the kid told the cops about a truck. - Right. - Okay. - I mean, can you just do it? - What? No. - I can put you on speaker. - Trust me. That would be super weird. - It doesn't seem that weird. - Just slip it in there. You know, real cas'. No big deal. - Okay, okay. Okay. - [chuckles] [footsteps approaching] - Hey, babe. So that gangster kid that you all flipped, did he say something about a truck or something? - A'ight so we sit this kid down, right. And before we can even start, my man's acting like he's about to get water-boarded or something like that. Starts singing like a bird. - For real? - Yes. Talking about places, time, faces. - Stop. - Names. - Trucks? - What? All kinds of stuff. . - Tyler.

Call me Leslie. - Yes, sir, Leslie. - Rolls right off the tongue. - Uh-huh. - [exhales] Hey, you know, um, I saw you were helping a lady out at Annie's register the other day. You know, you gave her a hug? - Oh, she initiated contact. Plus I know her. - Oh, it's okay. No, I was just wondering did you, um, meet her on the job? - No, not this job. Mary Pat's from my side job. - Mm? - Yeah. - Oh, what's the side job? You know, it doesn't matter. [clears throat] I mean, the only reason I was asking was because Ms. Mary Pat left her club card behind. So I just didn't want her to miss out on any Twofer Tuesday deals. - That's really nice of you. - Hey, um, you wouldn't have her number, would you? - No--but I do follow her on Instagram. She mainly posts stuff about church and her kids. It's pretty boring. Hey, so, for employee of the month, is there gonna be like a ceremony? See you, Leslie. [chuckles] - How sure are you? - Pretty sure. - No, that's not enough. I need, like, a percentage. - 97%. - Mm. Almost as accurate as the pill. - More. - No, the pill's 99.9%. - You can't be .1% knocked up. - Uh-uh, that's if you take it perfect. For most people, it's like 91%. - For you it was zero. - Okay. - Look, I'm never gonna remember every single thing that Stan said. But I think we should just go for it. - All right, here's the test. Do you remember that you called me? - Yes. - Do you remember that you were so high you forgot why you got high? Mm-hmm. - Look, I'm pretty sure the cops don't know anything about a truck. - All right. [sighs] Who's gonna drive? - Let's draw straws? - I always lose at that. - So the straws? - What about rock paper scissors? - We can't do that with three people. - Why not? - Basic math. [French pop music] ♪ - Everybody okay? - No smokies on my tail. - Yeah, I'm good. - You guys, that was so sick. They should totally make a movie about us. - Eh, no thanks. - Wait, why not? - Because I'd have to be the wisecracking black getaway driver with one line who dies five minutes in. - Eh, true, true. I'd be the Pacino. - Oh, you'd so be the Joe Pesci. - What? - Total Pesci. - Because I'm short? - It's like a whole Pesci vibe with you. - [scoffs] All right, you know what? Forget it. The movie's off. - Guys. - Pesci vibe. - Guys. - What? - There's a cop behind me. - Okay. Okay. Just relax. - Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one hauling a truckload of life sentences here. - Make a turn. - Yeah. Lose that sucker. - Don't lose him. Just go slow and chill. See if he follows. - Okay. Okay.

He can't do it alone. - Will you stop? - And I don't want him marrying a bimbo. - Oh, he's 100% gonna marry a bimbo. - No bimbos around my kids. - All right, no bimbos. - Monday's pizza day. The kids don't need lunch. Dance Tuesday. Same as the math tutor. The dentist appointments are on the refrigerator. Trash and recycling goes out Wednesday. [police siren whooping] - What's that? What's happening? [sirens wailing] - Beth? Beth. Say something. What's going on? - I'll write it all down, but he'll need a village. [radio chatter] I got to go. [phone beeps] Is there a problem, officer? - Driver's license and registration. - Just give me a minute. I hope I wasn't speeding. I've been rushing around like crazy all day. - Why's that? - Um. Little bit of a domestic situation. Not a good guy, you know? Had to get out of there as quickly as possible. #TimeIsUp, am I right? It's one of those. - This your truck? - I borrowed it. From a friend who's helping me with the domestic thing. Am I in trouble here? - First off, you're driving without a license plate. - My friend's a little bit of a mess too. - What's her name again? - Sorry? - The friend who loaned you the truck? - Oh, it's more of a friend of a friend. - I need you to get out of the car. You got a key to this lock? [keys jingle] - It must be one of these. [jingling lock] That's weird. - #TimesUp. ♪ . All: ♪ Praise him, praise him ♪ Ever in joyful song - Praise him, indeed.

[both chuckle] - You'll like it here. People are cool, the choir's strong-- - Most importantly, how are the donuts? - Oh, always fresh, always sprinkled. - Oh, sold. [both laugh] - Well, it was really nice to meet you, Leslie, and... you know, you have a really good voice. - Oh. - [chuckles] [clears throat] - Uh, would you ever want to... grab a coffee or something, ever? - I can't. - Oh yeah, no, totally. I get it, I get it. - It's not you-- - No, no, no, that's fine. You don't have to. I get it totally. All right. - No, I--it's not-- - Sorry for bothering you. Have a great night. - [shouting] My husband's dead. He passed away six months ago. Do you think you could come back closer so I don't have to shout about it? - Oh, yeah. Sorry. - [chuckles awkwardly] Um... So it's not that I don't want to go. I do. I know I should get back out there. But I am, you know... It would just be downhill from here, so. - How did he pass? - Heart attack. He was, um, playing water guns with the kids. My son thinks that he killed him 'cause he shot him in the chest with a Super Soaker right before he actually died. - Oh. - Told you it was downhill from here. - No, no. That... That was a good story. - [laughs] Well, if that's what you're into, there's more where that came from. - Hey, it takes a lot to scare me off, okay? - [laughing] Okay, 2001, summer of the shark. And guess who gets her period? - Ew. - No, that's not a true--that was a joke. That was a bad joke. Sorry. - Oh. No, that was funny. No, you're funny. [chuckles] - Well, if that's what you're into, there's more where that came from. [both chuckle] - I just got pulled over. - So? - So I barely talked myself out of being arrested. - For driving an empty truck? - Why didn't you do it yourself? Why did you need us to bring you an empty truck? - I had a kid. The Feds turned him. - So this is a test? - Needed to know if he talked. I guess he didn't. - And now we're back in business. - You're catching on. Give me the keys. - I have a family. I have children. - Yeah, you love telling me that, huh? - If you think you can use me like a worm on a hook so that you don't get caught-- - I ain't got time to hold your hand through this. Give me the keys. That family you're always talking about? Go home to 'em. What me and you had is done. Over. - You can't just fire us. - You think I need you? Ain't nothing but a damn charity case to me. - We need the money. - And I need more of your bitch-ass drama like I need a hole in my head. Go home. [tense resonating music] - What do you mean, you had a kid? What happened to him? What's that you're always saying about your rotten eggs and how you have to handle 'em? - Go home. ♪ - I don't see how you're gonna let me do that. Is it gonna be you? Or do I come home one day and your boys are in my kitchen? - Elizabeth. Go home. [door opens] - Chimney fell on an old lady in Wixom, fatal car accident on Southfield Freeway hm, drowning? What kind of nut job goes swimming this time of year? - You're kind of asking for it. - Ugh. I don't see anything about a dead gang kid. - You're sure he's coming for us? - We know too much now. He'd be an idiot not to. - I mean, homie has made this threat before. - I'm telling you, it's different. We're no good to him now. - He said the actual words? - He just looked at me funny. - Sadie just did a project on Great Whites. They have these inky black eyes that turn white right before they kill you. Was it funny like that or...? - Okay, glass half-full. He's just upset, and when he calms down he realizes we're good earners. - What's half-empty? - Getting put in a wood chipper. - I feel like he's more creative than that. Probably drop us in molten steel or feed us to pigs. - Everything's a joke to you? - I just deal with it in my own way, okay? - What do we do? - Why are you looking at me? - Because, you know, last time this happened you were all like, "Yeah, just try to hurt us. We eat at PF Chang's, bitch." Can't you... . - You feel really strongly about this. - "I've Got The Joy" just sounds better on electric guitar. I mean, no offense to Leonore's organ playing. - [chuckles] Jeff used to play it on guitar. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. He was also really into hard rock. Like he knew every Creed song by heart. You know? - [chuckles] - I was doing so good. - You made it the whole night. - Yeah, till now. - Well, you're home so it doesn't count. - [chuckles] I had fun tonight. - You're easy to have fun with.

[both laugh] Why are you trying to help me? - You're the mother of my child. - Is that all... I am to you? - Come on. You're not really gonna make me say it, are you? - Do you and Nance have matching sets? Or is this a bespoke number? - Take care of yourself, Annie.

Okay. Okay. - What? - [exhales sharply] So, um, a girl just... a girl in Madison just got hit by a drunk driver and her family is getting ready to take her off life support. - Is she... - She's a perfect match. - [breathing heavily] [children chatter, laughter] - How'd you sleep? - I didn't. - You guys. Maybe we should turn ourselves in. - You want to go to the cops? - I know, I know. - Now you want to go to the cops? - We'll go to jail, Annie. - Well, it's better than waiting to be murdered in some gnarly way that I haven't even thought of yet. - We got the call. What if it goes to someone else? [indistinct chatter] - All those fairy tales they told us when we were little girls?
