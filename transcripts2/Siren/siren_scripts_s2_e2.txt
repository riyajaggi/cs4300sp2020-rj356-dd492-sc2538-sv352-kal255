 ENJOY! Do not miss this tomorrow!  Previously on Siren. My dad talked to the M.E. about Decker. She said there was something going on in his brain. Will you sing to me? Do you know what it means? Great love to some. For others, a euphemism for obsession. Did I hear your friend say you have a boat? It's just a old fishing tub. Never been on a fishing boat. Lieutenant Martinez reporting.

 I've followed the trail, gained access, secured the location. I'll be in touch. My mom's back. - You think she's clean? - No idea. I'm sorry it had to go this way, okay? I tried to intervene. Marissa will step in while we figure out next steps. You mean while you find my replacement? Thanks. There's some kind of disturbance. Sound waves. Aah! What are they doing back? They were forced out. Oh, my God! You like it.

 It is good for us here. Family. Yes. Okay. We go back. Your mother. My sister. Gone. I help you now. You are strong. Like mother. Humans bring food. Humans. We go back. Now. Unh! My son came into my room. I was in bad shape. And he looked at me and he said, "Mommy, I love you, and I'm scared you're gonna die." That was it. Finally had to choose between the drugs and my kid. Your love for your son is inspiring. And that love is gonna help you. For all of us, the way out of our addiction is through relationships. You can't do it alone. Looks like we got a few newcomers with us today. If anyone else would like to share. All right. Uh, I'm... I'm Ben. - Hey, Ben. - Hi, Ben. What brings you here today? Uh, it's... It's kind of hard to explain. Um... I was in a... a complicated relationship, got obsessive, I guess. Started feeling unhealthy, so, uh, I'm... I'm not sure what to do when a relationship is the addiction. - Thanks, Ben. - Thank you, Ben. I, uh... I got you a matcha latte from Lilly's. Oh. Thank you. How's the, uh... How's the family reunion? My dad seems happy, so... So that oil company, they're mapping a thousand square miles of ocean. That's gonna take months. - Eight. - Eight months? How are we gonna manage them for eight months? Uh... carefully? - Good morning. - Hey. I was gonna make breakfast, but all you had was this shitty coffee and stale bread. Yeah, well, you should see the other boats on this dock. This is... This is luxury. Mm. Can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. You said your dad died not too long ago. Did it happen here? On this boat? So this is a sex first, ask questions later kind of relationship, huh? You got a problem with that? Not really. But, uh... Yeah, it happened here. We were, um, out on a run. This big storm. Main net got caught on its spindle. My dad went to clear it. Something happened. Pulled him overboard. Was just gone. - Damn. - Yeah. I'm sorry. Now I gotta get this boat back together. My dad left a big ol' pile of debt, so... That's a lot to deal with. All I ever saw was how strong her was. Fishing boat captain. Major tough ass. But he was just a guy, you know, just trying to get by. That's kinda the thing about life. I mean, you could wake up one morning and make a choice, change everything about yourself. - Hi. - Hey. Pajamas and slippers day, huh? Well, I figured I'd watch a couple of game shows and catch up on my soap operas. You know what I think? You are the best thing that happened to this town, and the council better come to its senses and give you your job back. Well, whatever's meant to be will be. Haida-Zen, yadda-yadda. You gotta fight back. I don't even understand why they fired you in the first place. How was the meeting this morning? I saw Ben Pownall. Really? And I'm assuming that Maddie knows about this. Actually, I'm not sure. Well, either way, it's not good for her. Growing up with an addict, and now dating one? It's my fault. I'm gonna have to help her get away from him. Uh, I'd think about that before giving her dating advice. Yeah. You're probably right. One step at a time. - Got it? - Yeah. Could be ugly in here. Ben! I couldn't sleep last night. I finally conked out around 3:00 A.M. They must have slipped out early. You were supposed to be watching them. You're the den mother. Yeah, well, den mother's got a lousy back. Hey! No need to push. Have you been watching Ryn with them? Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Sister's daughter. Really? Oh. Thank you. Hey, no, no, no, no, no. That's food. We eat that. Ta-da. You want to try? Yeah. Good. Hey, hey, hey. Ryn? Her skin. It's already getting bad. They need to go back. How? Those sonic waves almost killed you out there. They can't go back in the water. Calvin? That's me. Ian Sutton, KFGT News? I texted you this morning. Oh, hey. Hey. Thanks for coming all the way from Seattle to talk to me. I... I didn't. I came up here to report on those beached whales. I figured while I was up here, I'd follow up on your call. Bristol Cove isn't exactly our regular beat. Okay, cool. So what'd you want to talk to me about? You know how Bristol Cove is big into the whole mermaid thing? Yep, I'm gettin' that. Well, check this out. What, a sea lion? - That's no sea lion. - Then what is it? It's a mermaid. A real one. No kidding? Hey, what does a story like that usually pay? Calvin, we're a news organization. We don't pay for our stories. Look, you want to sell a story about a real-life mermaid? Call the Enquirer. Okay, the exploration starts here and moves south. And the sonic waves amplify as they move out at least 500 miles. Maybe we could take them out past that. Could you go far out into the ocean - where the sound is okay? - No. There are others. Strong ones. They will fight us. Other colonies? They protect their water. They're territorial. They can't last much longer here. They need to go back tonight. I got some ideas. Now, there are some places, given the topography, that the sound in the water might be less. I can show them to you. Okay, yes. When will the oil project be finished? Eight months. Eight months? We need to feed them, clothe them, maybe find them somewhere new to stay. We're gonna need money. Yes, money. You won't ask your father for anything, I know, but I can. And he will give it to me. You show me the water. Wait, Ryn, no, we can't leave them here. I tell them to stay. They listen to me. I'll watch them. Maddie, I don't feel good about this. It's okay. They're degrading. They're weaker. I can handle it. Just in case. Hello, Berta. I'm here to see boss. Mr. Pownall is in a meeting right now. Oh. I'll wait. Helen! Don't mind! Ah, luck. Perfect timing. Meg, Jack, thanks for coming. Helen? Ted. To what do I owe the pleasure? All the other coves around here are deep water, so the sound will be very bad. Now, this one is shallow. If they stay close to the shore, the sonic effect will be less. I think this is our best choice. The people are here. Yeah. We'll do it at night. There won't be anyone here. It's fire. We use it to cook our food. Careful. It's hot. Fire can be dangerous. Great. I'll have these filed, and it should take one or two business days to release the funds. Thank you. I was always told that this money was to keep your side of the family quiet. We have always lived up to our side of the bargain. Your mother and your grandmother knew to keep the fund intact. I'm the end of the line, Ted. There's nowhere else for it to go. Why all of a sudden? Huh? What's it for? It's none of your business. Maybe I'll buy a Maserati. Xander? Oh, uh, hey. Hey, Mr. Pownall. You okay? Yeah. I'm just, um, you know, making a deposit. You always put on a shirt and tie to make a deposit? Um, it's the North Star, she needs fixing. Figured on a loan, huh? That's good. Your dad, he made a lot of sacrifices to keep his company going. He'd be proud you're doing the same thing. Okay. Where do we go? We're gonna get you something that's gonna help you get by here on land. Uh, okay, let's try that again, but this time, eyes open. Yeah, yeah, we're good. Okay, we'll use that one. Okay. Are you sure this is gonna work? Dude, this like the Mona Lisa of fake IDs You don't have to worry about getting carded, ever. Okay, Ryn, R-Y-N. Last name? Fisher. Ryn Fisher. Okay, I'm gonna put your age at 22. Learn this date. Know your sign. Sign. Uh, yeah, you're a Pisces. Okay. And... And voila. Your new driver's license. May it bring you many years of happy drinking. I am Pisces, 22. Uh, yes, that is how old you are. How long you've been alive. 22 years. Years. Uh, it's... It's one of the ways we tell time. How do you measure time in the ocean? Um, maybe by the tides? The whales. When they go, come back. Yeah, annual migration. Okay, so how many times have the whales gone and come back since you were born? Many times. Like, 50? What, a hundred? Stop. - What? - Stop the car. What? What? Okay. Okay. I will drive. No. Just 'cause you have a license, - it doesn't mean... - I want to learn. We gotta get back to the cabin. There is time. They go at night. All right. Okay. A driving lesson with a mermaid. That is the brake. Good. That makes you stop. And this is the gas. Very gentle. This is the steering wheel. You move it this way to go that way. This way, you go there. - You understand? - I do. I watch you drive. Okay. You ready? Ready. D Way up, way up, we go d Brakes! Brakes! D Been up and down that road d - d Way up, way up, oh no d - Easy, okay? - D We gon' burn the whole house down d - Easy. D Watch me stand in the line d Yeah. Straighten up. - D You're only servin' lies d - Good, good. D You got somethin' to hide d d We gon' burn the whole house down d - I'm a good driver. - Yeah. D We gon' burn the whole house down d - I'm a good driver. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look. Hey. Hey, Mr. McClure. Uh, Xander. So I talked with my manager. Yeah? I really pushed for you on this one, but we ran the numbers, and, unfortunately, it's saying that we can't approve this loan. It would be too high a risk. So I'm too high of a risk? Just according to the numbers. You went to Bristol, right? Well, yeah. I was a class behind you. I was on cheer squad when you played football. Go Whalers! Yeah. Yeah, you were kind of a dick back then, too. D Should I keep it light? d Whoa! Okay, okay, okay. D If I write a song d d Preachin' what is wrong d You are okay? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm... I'm... I'm laughing. It's funny. Funny. It's like, uh, when you feel good and you're happy. I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. D Way up, way up, oh no d No, no, no, no, no. You can't force it. It just has to happen. I would like to laugh someday. Yeah, I'm sure you will. What if the way I feel about you has nothing to do with the song? Yes, Ben. Maybe. Hurry! We're almost there! Come on! Wolves don't usually attack people. Maybe it sensed that they were predators, even though they're weakened. Ryn? I'm sorry. They just snuck out. I should have been more careful. No. They. I say stay. You stay. You do what I say. You listen. Water is bad, but you must go in. Strong like mother. Hey, sailor. You look amazing. Can I get a lift? Uh-huh. - Oh, watch the clams! - Yep, all right. Whoo! Comin' through. Prelim! Hey! Whoo. Whaddup, fishes! I forgot how fun this town can be. Yeah. Except I feel like people are totally looking at me. Oh, don't be silly. It's true, Dale. How do you not see it? Listen, of all the nights, this is not the one where people are looking at you. They're in. And they know to come straight back out? Yes. I tell them. D Oh, girl, I like it d d Anytime, anyplace, anywhere d d Just a few hours d - Here you go. - Thank you. D Honey, I'm melting d You're working here now, huh? Janine hooked me up, few days a week. So that means you're staying in town then. Huh. This town's really got mermaids on the brain. What's up with that? Yeah. You don't know the half of it. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's roll! Everybody down to the beach! Come on! Get in the water! Oh, my God, you've gotta be kidding me! No, no, no, no! You can't go in! - It's not safe! - Stop! Wait! No, wait! Hey, no, no! You can't go in there! - Stop! - Get out! It's not safe! You have to get out! - Stop! - No, you can't go in here! - Wait! - Stop! No, you can't. Come on, get out of the water! We should go for a dip. You're crazy. Dad! Dad! Hi, sweetie. I need to talk to you, alone. Guess who's goin' in there! Get out! Get out of the water! Everybody, out of the water! Now! You have to get out! Aah! Everybody, out of the water! Out of the water now! Ryn, no! Get out! Come on! Dale, what is going on?! Maddie, can you take your mother home? Sure. Come on. Get out! We're locking it down. Any idea what happened out there? Yeah, I talked to Ben about it. He said it's probably a sea lion. Shouldn't have been in the water. You know what happened tonight? It's them. How many? A small group, six. Xander, they're gonna be back on land a little longer. An oil company is doing some exploration work. The sound pollution, they can't take it. Xan, he's with them. The one who killed my dad? Yeah. Look, I just... I need to know that you're gonna be okay with it. Have you... Have you lost your mind?! Look, get out of my way! Come here, you son of a bitch! Come here! - Come here! - No! No, Xander! No! - Get off of me! - Xan! - Dale! - Come here! You want them here, huh?! In our town?! Really, Ben?! Oh! Stop! Xan, stop! Knock it off, both of you! Xander, stop it! Stop it! I'm not the risk! Okay? They're the risk! He's gonna be a problem. Humans stay angry. What the hell? Do you think I'm gonna make it through like this? What?! You ignore me! People in town are whispering behind my back! Your father sends me home as if I couldn't possibly understand what's going on! You know how much work I have done to come back here? Okay, Mom. Sorry it doesn't look how you want it to. Guess it's gonna take time. Why? Why? Maybe because of all the days teachers had to walk me home from school 'cause you were too wasted to come get me. Or how I never had friends over so they wouldn't see my mom strung out, watching TV in the middle of the day! And then you just disappear, a day, two days. This time, new record, almost a year. You don't get to erase all that by showing up for a week. So you've got patience for Ben, but not for me, huh? I know about your boyfriend. That he's an addict. What are you talking about? I saw Ben at a recovery meeting. Really wanted help with the unhealthy relationship that he was in. Mom, there are things you don't know about my life right now, and I'm willing to share them someday, but you need to earn that. Come, get a good night sleep. I need to get back, okay? I'm gonna stick around this time. I promise I'm gonna stay. Okay. Okay, Mom. The water. Pain! Yes, I know. Ben teach me to drive. Seriously? I am a good driver. Okay. Oh, Ryn. Hello. Hello. Uh... hey? - Hey, come on! - Ech! Hey! Hey, you can't do that! You gotta buy it first! Hey, damn it, I said leave it be! Hey! Stop that! Stop it! Put it back! Hey! Out! Now! We are stronger than them. I am stronger than you. Look, they just... They had... They had too much to drink. - Sorry, man. - This should cover it, right? No. No, Ryn, she can't go. That's not safe. She'll be okay. It's not her I'm worried about. It could get ugly, man. We're not done with those things. What?! That was them? Out there in the water? Everything good? What happened out there tonight? Um, it's nothing. Just another round? Hello, Helen. I know why you're here. It's a lot of money. What are you planning on doing with it? Renovating your shop? I'll tell you the same thing I told your husband. It's none of your business. Actually, it is. If you really think about it, it's pretty unlikely that you are related to the Pownalls. My family has been in this town a lot longer than you have, so you're not really qualified to make such a claim. The account is mine. You have no recourse. I'm quite busy. Shall I get Scott, or will you be exiting on your own? If you don't mind. I think they were all drunk. I don't know, they were barefoot, acting all weird, seemed like foreigners. Barely spoke English. How many? I don't know, six, seven. And it was one of the women that pushed you to the ground? Yep. Anything else you can think of? Vehicles? Yeah, they got in a van. Uh, Pownall Seafood. Pownall? Ted Pownall's got some property not too far from here. All right. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hello. - What? That look. Hello. I just wanted to say, um... Hello. I know how hard it's been for you. Dealing with Ryn and the song. I also know you're trying to get better. My mom told me about the support group meeting. She was there? Were you there because of Ryn? Yeah. I think it's great you're working on it. Means a lot. Still hungry. Never stop eating. When are you gonna tell her about what happened to her mother? She cannot know this now. That humans did this. Or she will not stay on land. It is a good day. ENJOY! Do not miss this tomorrow!
