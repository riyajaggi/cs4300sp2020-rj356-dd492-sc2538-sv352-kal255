HOW TO DESCRIBE DEAN -- PICTURE AN EMPEROR OR RICHARD BRANSON, IF RICHARD BRANSON HAD BALLS. Andrew: HE'S KIND OF LIKE OUR ANSWER TO BRUCE WAYNE. Baxter: YEAH. HE'S BATMAN. Andrew: WHAT? BRUCE WAYNE IS BATMAN? Dean: I HAVE A SPEECH. WHEN I STARTED THIS COMPANY YEARS AGO, PEOPLE LAUGHED AT ME. THE IDEA OF BUYING AND SELLING BITS OF THE EARTH -- CAN YOU IMAGINE THE HUBRIS? AND YET HERE WE STILL STAND, AND THE COMPANY IS HUGELY SUCCESSFUL, AND I'VE DONE IT ALL ON MY OWN. BUT I HAVE BECOME BORED. SO HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. IN EIGHT WEEKS' TIME, I'M GOING TO TAKE ON A PARTNER HERE AT PLATINUM. -[ Murmuring ] -ONE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM. Victoria: MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP TO THIS MOMENT. AFTER ALL, A KING NEEDS HER CROWN. Amir: OH, MAN! THIS IS SOME "GAME OF THRONES" SHIT. Andrew: WILL THIS BE 100% ABOUT SALES? Dean: EVERYTHING WILL BE CONSIDERED. SALES, OF COURSE, ARE THE BEST INDICATOR OF WHO IS MOTIVATED, BUT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS TO CONSIDER. Amir: I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I THINK YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL OFFICE. IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO IT. Dean: I'M SORRY. AMIR, ARE YOU -- Chelsea: THAT'S A THREAT. -Dean: THIS IS A THREAT. -Amir: NO, I'M... Dean: IT'S AN OLD-FASHIONED MAFIA EXTORTION THREAT. -Chelsea: YEAH. -Amir: NO. I'M JUST SAYING IT'S A BEAUTIFUL OFFICE -- Dean: YES. Amir: I WOULD HATE FOR SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN TO IT. Chelsea: STOP THREATENING DEAN. Dean: YES, THAT'S THE THREAT PART.

Amir: NO, I'M SAYING IF YOU DON'T MAKE ME PARTNER, THEN SOMETHING BAD MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOUR OFFICE. Dean: YOU SHOULD STOP SAYING THAT. -Chelsea: WE KNOW. -Baxter: IS THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND ONE OTHER PERSON, OR WOULD YOU... -Andrew: CONSIDER? -Baxter: ...CONSIDER A DUO? WELL, THIS PARTNERSHIP IS OURS BECAUSE TWO IS BETTER THAN ONE. Andrew: YEAH. THINK ABOUT IT -- EYES, EARS, NOSTRILS, KIDNEYS -- Baxter: DICKS. Chelsea: ARE YOU GOING TO BASE IT ON TWITTER FOLLOWERS? THAT PARTNERSHIP'S AS GOOD AS MINE. THESE DINOSAURS NEED TO PREPARE TO MEET THEIR COMET. Dean: HMM. I HADN'T CONSIDERED THAT... AND I'M NOT CONSIDERING IT NOW. Victoria: THIS IS ABSURD. I'M CLEARLY THE MOST QUALIFIED. Dean: VICTORIA, PERHAPS YOU ARE. DO ALL OF YOU FEEL THIS WAY, THAT VICTORIA'S THE MOST QUALIFIED? -Victoria: ABSOLUTELY. -Chelsea: HELL, NO. -Baxter: NO. -Dean: THEN YOU MUST SHOW ME! NO, I DENY YOUR HANDSHAKE. IT IS TOO SOON. Victoria: HE CAN DENY MY HANDSHAKE, BUT HE CAN'T DENY MY SALES NUMBERS, MY TALENT, MY IMPECCABLE WARDROBE, MY FLAWLESS SKIN, MY PHENOMENAL CHEEKBONES. WHAT WAS THE QUESTION? Dean: NOW, ON TO NEW BUSINESS. Victoria: [ SIGHS ] Dean: MEET OUR NEW OFFICE MANAGER, GLENN. GLENN? Chelsea: WHAT? Victoria: OFFICE MANAGER? WHAT DO WE HAVE TO MANAGE?

I'M GLENN BOUCHARD, AND I'M THE NEW OFFICE MANAGER. DEAN HAS ENTRUSTED ME TO STREAMLINE THE OPERATIONS HERE AT PLATINUM REALTY. I AM SO EXCITED, BEYOND EXCITED, TO BE WORKING FOR PLATINUM REALTY. I'D SAY MY MANAGERIAL STYLE IS PRETTY HANDS-OFF, BUT I HAVE LONG FINGERS. AS YOUR OFFICE MANAGER, I JUST WANT TO HELP THINGS RUN MORE SMOOTHLY THAN THEY'RE ALREADY RUNNING. WITH THAT IN MIND, I'VE PREPARED A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR EVERYBODY TO FILL OUT. YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE BROKERS TOOK IT REALLY WELL, AND SOME OF THEM JUST TOOK IT WELL. THERE ARE JUST SOME QUESTIONS THAT IF YOU GIVE HONEST ANSWERS, UH, IT WILL HELP ME REALLY GET TO KNOW WHO YOU GUYS ARE AS A -- OKAY. SOME TOOK IT POORLY. IT WAS A MIX. HARD TO SAY THE PERCENTAGES, BUT, EVENTUALLY, I THINK I'LL WIN THEM OVER. Both: [ GRUNTING ] Baxter: ANDREW AND I ARE BEST FRIENDS. Andrew: WE WORK TOGETHER, WE LIVE TOGETHER. WE DO NOT HAVE SEX TOGETHER. Baxter: RIGHT. NO. I'M GAY, HE'S STRAIGHT. Andrew: WE WILL HAVE SEX IN THE SAME ROOM SOMETIMES. WE TRY NOT TO LOOK OR LISTEN. Baxter: IT'S HARD. -WE MET IN REHAB. -Andrew: YEAH, REHAB. Baxter: I MEAN, WE DIDN'T MEET IN IT. WE MET AT IT 'CAUSE WE BOTH DRUNK-DROVE AND CRASHED INTO IT, AND THEN WE MET, ONCE WE GOT OUT OF OUR CARS, INSIDE OF IT. Both: [ Grunting ] Chelsea: ANDREW AND BAXTER COMPLETE EACH OTHER. TOGETHER THEY MAKE ONE PASSABLE PERSON. Andrew: SO WE GET A CALL ABOUT A POTENTIAL CLIENT, THE BIGGEST MOVIE STAR ON EARTH -- JOHNNY DUNNE.

IT'S FUCKING DOPE, BRO. Baxter: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT QUALIFIES AS A HOME STUDIO, BUT WE CAN -- WE CAN LIST IT, YOU KNOW. Baxter: WOULD YOU LEAVE THE EQUIPMENT IN THERE? Johnny: IT'S A HOME STUDIO. Andrew: ARE YOU GONNA TAKE THE LAPTOP WITH YOU? Johnny: IT'S MY LAPTOP, BRO. Baxter: AND THE MICROPHONE? Johnny: IT'S MY MICROPHONE, BRO. Baxter: OKAY, WELL, IT'S PROBABLY JUST A ROOM, THEN, IF YOU'RE TAKING THE EQUIPMENT OUT OF IT. Andrew: IT'S A BASEMENT. Baxter: ENOUGH FOREPLAY. Andrew: IT'S TIME TO SLIDE IT IN. Baxter: ANYWAY, THIS PLACE IS GREAT. WE'RE GONNA AT LEAST GET 12 FOR THIS. Andrew: YEAH. WHAT KIND OF TIME ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? Johnny: LISTEN, YOU GUYS. YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS, AND I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE. I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT'S RIGHT. Andrew: ABSOLUTELY. Johnny: I NEED YOU TO HAVE A DRINK WITH ME. I NEED BOTH OF YOU GUYS TO HAVE A DRINK WITH ME. Andrew: HEY, MAN. WE ARE SOBER. AS MUCH AS I WANT TO -- Johnny: YOU'RE SOBER? Baxter: WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO STAY SOBER. IT'S ONLY BEEN FOUR DAYS SO FAR. Andrew: AND THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE. Johnny: FUCK THIS SHIT. ALL RIGHT? WE'RE GOING JOHNNIE WALKER BLUE. -IF YOU'RE SOBER... -Andrew: OHHH. Johnny: ...YOU NEED THE GOOD STUFF, RIGHT? Baxter: OKAY, YEAH.

Glenn: UH, NOT THAT I KNOW OF. MY FATHER DIED BEFORE I WAS BORN, AND I HAVE NO SIBLINGS. SO MY HOME LIFE WAS VERY LONELY AND SAD. DEAN HIRED ME TO HELP THE BROKERS IN ANY WAY I CAN, EXCEPT FOR HELPING THEM TO SELL HOUSES. MAYBE SOMEDAY I'LL BE A BROKER, BUT FOR RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST HERE TO MAKE THE TRAINS RUN ON TIME -- JUST LIKE A FASCIST DICTATOR. Victoria: HI! Glenn: HEY. DID NOT MEAN TO INTERRUPT. Victoria: NO PROBLEM. TELL ME YOU HAVE THAT SURVEY. Glenn: I DO. THIS QUESTIONNAIRE -- -Victoria: OH, YAY! -Glenn: THIS IS GREAT. YAY! Victoria: OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT ALL THESE QUESTIONS.

WE SAT OUTSIDE, AND WE MADE A GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT A GREAT HOUSE IT IS, YOU NEEDED TO MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING BIGGER, AND SOMETHING THAT FITS YOUR PERSONALITY NOW. Johnny: ANDREW, WHAT'S UP, BRO?

IT'S LIKE HE KNEW THAT I WAS NEW AND JUST SHOWED ME THAT HE CARED. Amir: SO, WHAT'S YOUR DEAL, BRO? Glenn: UH, "WHAT'S MY DEAL, BRO?" Amir: YEAH. NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF YOU. DEAN GIVES YOU A JOB OUT OF NOWHERE. I WOULD BE AN IDIOT NOT TO ASK, "WHAT IS YOUR DEAL, BRO?" Glenn: THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PAPER IN THE WORLD TO BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
