Who are you, sweetie? -Andrew: Andrew Wright. I'm a -- uh -- a man. -Ever been blacked out and have a dick drawn on your face? -Andrew: Yes. -Roger: Yeah, I thought so. Who else do we have in the all-girl choir? You don't look like you're a real estate agent. -Baxter: My name is Baxter Reynolds. I'm a... -Roger: "I'm Baxter Reynolds." I know Burt Reynolds. -Baxter: How? -Roger: 'Cause I fucking party. I do cocaine. I know all the stars. I used to hang out with Buddy Ebsen. -Baxter: I don't know who that is. -Roger: He was the original Tin Man! -Chelsea: I thought it was Nipsey Russell. -Roger: Nipsey Russell was not the original Tin Man, maybe in "The Wiz." -Chelsea: I think it was "The Wiz." -Roger: Don't fucking get racist with me!

I've seen more enthusiasm on death row. -Amir: I question Roger's methods as a fellow salesman. I respect him, though, as a fellow asshole. -Roger: Buy this book, "Rare Steaks and Deals Well Done" by Roger Ramsey. -Chelsea: He's got this overhead projector. And he's, like, showing us slides, or some... I don't know. What is this, a museum? Am I looking at a fossil? -Roger: What do you all see? Office supplies, what do you see? -Glenn: Seems to be three weird shapes that are out of focus, sir. -Roger: No imagination. Angie. -Andrew: Andrew. -Roger: Is it -IE, with a smiley face over the I? -Andrew: If you were gonna spell it that way, that... -Roger: What do you see, Angie? -Andrew: No. I see an upside-down mermaid face. -Roger: Upside-down mermaid face. Okay. How 'bout now? -Andrew: It's a right-side up, uh, mermaid face. -Roger: Pantyhose, what do you see? -Baxter: Three jewels? -Roger: We're getting there. Three jewels where? -Andrew: On the Nile. -Baxter: On the Nile? -Roger: Christ. -Victoria: Why don't you tell us what you want us to see? -Roger: A fucking pile of cash! -Victoria: Okay. -Roger: That's what I fucking see! That's all I see is money, money! You divine it! You fucking make it rain! It's so you can make it fucking rain! -Amir: I'm showing new clients houses in Malibu and West Hollywood today. They happen to be lesbians. Watch the chameleon work. As you follow me over here... Voilà! -Liz: Okay. -Amir: The money shot, or you know, whatever. -Liz: Yeah, a decent view. I see the ocean. But I'm just wondering in terms of, like, scalability, what's on the other side of that? -Amir: Japan is on the other side of that. -Liz: I don't mean the... -You have the whole Pacific Ocean here. -Liz: No. I mean on the other side of this... -Jamie: Of the... -Liz: Uh, Plexiglass wall. Or maybe it's, like, bulletproof. Is it bulletproof? -Amir: Uh, no. It's not bulletproof. -Amir: I think you guys are being a -- a little too paranoid. We're in Los Angeles. And you can be gay and not get attacked. It's fine. Are you guys from, like Alabama, or... -Liz: Wait. Number one: Do not even start to tell me anything about what it's like to be gay unless you're gay. Are you gay? -Amir: Fuck no. -Jamie: Well that was a weird tone. -Liz: That's a terrible thing to say. -Amir: I... -Liz: We are not concerned about being attacked for being gay. We're concerned because we're famous people. Do you not know we're famous? -Amir: Of course I know that you're famous. You think I don't do my research? I had no idea they were famous. -Liz: And I don't even mean famous. I mean, like -- like, women, you know, tattooing our faces on their faces. Like, a lesbian calls out our name during sex with her partner. -Jamie: Yeah. And they're both into it. -Amir: Your work, it goes beyond saying. -Liz: Uh-huh. -Amir: So I don't need to say. -Liz: He doesn't know the name of the show. -Amir: I do know the name of your show. I do know the name of your show. -Liz: We're on a show called "Butch & Cassidy." "Bitch -- Butch & Cassidy!" Yeah. All right. Keep going. -Liz: No. I mean, are you not getting that? -Jamie: It's our thing. -Okay, I get your concerns. I understand what's going on here. And I want you to know that I'm gonna find you a house that speaks to all of your concerns, or I won't be glad. [GLAAD] Isn't that a gay thing? 'Cause I -- I read "Gay for Dummies" before. -Liz: Yeah. I mean, that's -- that's a thing. -Amir: It's, like, a thing. Baxter: We have an open house today in the very famous Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhood. -Andrew: 9021-- -Both: Oh, yeah! -Baxter: Do we have enough? I mean, we have the vodka ice luge... -Andrew: Bax, look at this place. I think this place will sell itself. -Baxter: Yeah, but I just... -Andrew: Oh, no. It's Serge and Gio. -Serge: Are you going to kiss me first? -Baxter: Before what? -Serge: Before you fuck me. -Baxter: Serge and Gio own Platinum's number one rival: Infinity Realty. -Andrew: They think that every house within the zip-code of Beverly Hills Post Office belongs to them. -Serge: How you doing? -Andrew: I'm fine. -Serge: Oh, I forget -- Don't run away. Don't run away. Don't run away. Where are we? You've already made yourself at home. Why don't you tell us where we are? -Serge: You made yourself at home. Tell me. Just say where we are. -Gio: Say where we are. -Baxter: Beverly Hills. -Serge: Ah. -Baxter: Post Office. Both: Beverly Hills Post Office. Beverly Hills Post Office, eh? -Serge: You usually sell houses in Beverly Hills Post Office? -Gio: This is your turf? -Andrew: I mean, we can do business anywhere. -Baxter: We... -Andrew: No, no, no, no, no, no. -Baxter: No, no, no, no. -Andrew: Serge. Serge. Serge. -Serge: No one's going to point a gun at you. No one's going to point a gun at you. -Andrew: Jesus Christ! Put the gun away! -Serge: No one's going to point a gun at you! -Andrew: No! -Gio: Do it. Do it. Are you gonna do it? -Baxter: Stop. Serge, stop. -Serge: I love this man. -Gio: Do it. -This man pulled me out of... -Gio: Do it. -Serge: A pile of corpses in Montenegro. -Gio: Do it. -And I will kill him right now. -Do it.

He's calling my bluff. I'm calling your bluff. You do it. Do it. -Andrew: I'm calling everybody's bluff. I'm calling your bluff. Don't do it. -Serge: Okay, guys. Here, guys. Here's how it goes. -Gio: Just shoot him. They don't get... -Serge: Don't worry about him. -Stop. Stop the gun. -The gun is just a talking point. -Baxter: We need stronger talking point control laws in this country. -Serge: Everything you sell in Beverly Hills Post Office, 1 percent. -Gio: You get this much pie. We get that much pie. One percent. -Andrew: And you guys won't bother us again? -Serge: No, we will bother you all the fucking time. -Gio: No, yeah. Every time.

Okay. -Serge: Do you leave this here? -Baxter: Why would that be ours? -Gio: So you didn't bring a sword? -Serge: You didn't bring sword? -Baxter: We'd never bring a sword to an open house! -Serge: Welcome to Beverly Hills Post Office. How 'bout that? How you like that? -Gio: How you like that? -Serge: We're gonna take our sword. We're gonna go. -Baxter: So it is your sword. -Andrew: Oh, it is your sword. -Of course, it's my sword! -Gio: I feel like you should've put that together. -No, we did. -No, we did. -We did. -You just -- you... -Oh, okay. You guys ever been to Infrared Sauna? You wanna come? -Baxter: We can't get an appointment there. I've been trying to get an appointment there for a year. -Serge: Come on. Come on. We know the guy. -Gio: We know the guy. Watch out for the bush. Come on. Oh, Jesus. -Serge: Step out of the bushes. That's what I just said, retard. What's your problem? Really, what's your problem? -Baxter: Sorry. ♪♪ -Roger: Look alive, girls, man on the floor! -Victoria: Roger? -Roger: Man on the floor. -Glenn: What's going on, man? -Roger: Roger has decided to take a little staycation. -Glenn: Staycation. -Roger: Yeah, you get it. -Amir: What does that mean? -Victoria: Yeah. What do you mean? -Roger: The Dean kind of let it slip that he's looking for a new partner. So I've decided to accept. -Victoria: What? -Glenn: What? -Amir: He made you partner? -Roger: What do I have to do, outsell you guys? That's easier done than said. -Victoria: Where does this guy get off? -Amir: In the break room! I walked in on him. And he didn't even care! -Roger: All right. Stand up, paper clips. -Glenn: Okay, that's... -Amir: You honestly think you can sell more than us? -Roger: How could I not? Ugh. This is my desk now, by the way, hon. -That's a lot of my stuff. -Roger: Yeah. Your stuff belongs down there, not up here. You guys have so much to learn. Mm. Reminds me of my dad, buried at sea...we think. Get yourself one of these if you wanna be successful. It's called a Rolodex. That's how sales are made. This is where you make calls. I don't want that! -Amir: What's wrong with you? -Roger: What's wrong with me? What's right with me? Everything. -Amir: And you're getting hammered at work. -Roger: Getting hammered? Shit, I'm already there. Join me. -Amir: Yeah. -Glenn: I just set up over there. So if you need me... -Roger: Right on the floor, where I need you. Amir, what are you working on? -Amir: I'm working on closing a $20 million home in West Hollywood. -Roger: West Hollywood? That should be easy. Just get a sailor, Nancy-boy, tightrope walker, slinky. -Amir: Wow. -Victoria: Those aren't actually slurs. -Roger: They are now. You, get me a T-bone steak and a pot of coffee. And keep it coming. -Victoria: Excuse me? I'm not your secretary. -Roger: Ah. -Victoria: In fact, I'm your biggest competition here. -Roger: You are not my competition because I don't have any, Vickie. You are under me, or you soon will be. Ugh. Don't waste good scotch, Glenn! -Glenn: Sorry. I didn't see the label. -Victoria: You know, Roger, I liked you in the beginning. -Roger: Liked? -Victoria: Yeah. -Roger: That's past tense. -Glenn: Now that I know what it is, I think I'll be all right. -Roger: What is it, Vickie? -Victoria: I just wanna make something clear. -Roger: Yep. -Victoria: I don't know when the last... Jesus Christ. -Roger: You're gonna keep doing it until you get it right, Glenn. If you don't swallow it, I will punch you in the dick. Go. -Victoria: You're gonna -- you're gonna get hit in the dick. -Roger: Throw it up. -Victoria: Ugh. -Roger: Get me a fucking steak, honey! -Amir: Are you okay? -Glenn: It's fine. It helped me swallow a lot of it. -Roger: All right. Let's make some calls. Glenn, hook up this phone. Hello. Can I speak to Barbara Gregory, please? I'm gonna need more Scotch and some petty cash. -Amir: I'm taking Liz and Jamie to a great house in West Hollywood. None of the previous houses have met their security standards. Not enough security? It's like, "Don't flatter yourself, ladies. Nobody wants to kill you." And if you'll follow me, you're gonna see this beautiful open kitchen... -Liz: Oh, yeah. -Amir: Perfect for lesbian breakfast... -Liz: I like that dining... -Amir: Lesbian lunch. -Liz: That window is -- is nerve-racking, though. -Jamie: Oh, yeah. That's way too much window. -Liz: I mean, 'cause somebody could just get, you know... If you just do the dive over. -Jamie: Yeah. They could just dive right in there. There's a wall there, though. There's a wall there, right by the window. -Jamie: They could climb up the wall. -Glenn: I've got the specs for the house in the... Oh, my god! -Amir: Oh, you ladies are gonna love the... -Glenn: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Butch & Cassidy. -Jamie: Yeah, it's us. -Glenn: I've seen every episode of "Butch & Cassidy," like, 25 times. It, uh, it is probably, by far, the greatest show ever created about two lesbian women that move west at the turn of the 20th Century and create an all-female frontier town. Oh, my God! -Liz: So, um, I mean, I'm a little surprised you love our show so much. -Jamie: Yeah. -Amir: Me, too. -Glenn: Are you... -Liz: Not the typical fan. What other shows do you like to watch? -Glenn: Uh, well, top of the list is definitely historical fiction lesbian dramas. Um, but I'm also very much into, uh, you know, soccer dramedies. -Liz: Right. -Glenn: Uh, and then I love super cuts of, like, "Red Shoe Diaries" with the sex taken out. -Amir: That's great. Isn't that great? I think it's great. Get the fuck out of here now. Get the fuck out of here. -Glenn: Is that code? -Amir: No, that's not -- Get the fuck out of here. -Liz: Don't hurt him. -Amir: Mm. He is, uh... -Liz: Straight up, that should've been your reaction when you met us, right? -Jamie: Yeah. -Glenn: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I talked to them. And they talked to me! -Victoria: Probably an hour. I'm at an open house right now. -Gio: Oh, my God. Look at this beautiful creature. -Serge: Oh, my god! -Victoria: All right. Just call it in. Thank you. -Serge: Oh, my God. Am I dreaming this? -Victoria: Serge, Gio. -Gio: Speak to my face. -Serge: Did you think about what we said to you, huh? -Victoria: I did. And unfortunately, my answer's the same that it was in all 37 of those e-mails. -[ Both groan ] -Serge and Gio have been trying to poach me from Dean for months. It's annoying, but I can't blame them. I'm irresistible. -Serge: What, uh, what would it take... -Gio: What will it take for you to be a partner with us? What would it take -- Your power. -Victoria: I love working for Dean, okay? -Gio: Whoa. It's like a battered woman. A battered woman say, "Oh, I'm so sorry!" -Victoria: We get each other. -Gio: "I'm so sorry, Chris Brown! I'm so sorry!" -Don't be a battered woman. -Victoria: Hey! -Both: Don't be a battered woman. -Victoria: I will take your nut sac, and I will turn it... -Serge: Do it. You can do anything you want to my nut sac. Come on, Victoria. -Victoria: And then I will serve it to your fucking friends. -That's why we love you! -Touch me again... -Gio: I will watch the whole thing. -That's why we love you! You're us! You'll eat someone's balls. -To prove a point about real estate. -Serge: We -- we dig that. -Gio: We love that. -Serge: In Montenegro, we had to because we were starving. Now... -Victoria: A man's balls? -Gio: What other kind of balls are there? -Like, an animal's. It could be, like, a bull's. -Oh, that's true. Bulls' balls are good, though. -Serge: That's, like, dessert compared to what we eat in Montenegro. -Victoria: Well, that's what I'm asking. Did you... Was it... -I'm saying you're like us. And you know what I mean by that. You're a cunt. -Gio: Horrible. -Serge: You're, like, the worst. I'm saying that... -Gio: We say that as... -Serge: That with love because we love you. -We're not like, "Oh, you're a cunt." -Are you saying you're a cunt? -Yeah, yeah, yeah! Come be a cunt with us. -It doesn't change the word if you turn it up. -Come be a cunt with us. -That doesn't... No. -We mean good. -Okay. I've got... -We don't mean... -Gio: We mean good cunt. -Victoria: I don't like cunt. Uh, can we come up with something else? -Gio: Bitch. -Serge: Be a bitch. -No, because then you could be a little bitch. -Serge: Oh, my god. Stop it. Come to us. Come to us. -Victoria: What is this? -Gio: Come to the dark side. -Victoria: What is this? -It's hard to see because it's charcoal on black. -Gio: That was a mistake. -This is your business card? -Serge: Yeah, it's our... -Gio: We wrote black on card stock and black on ink, which was a mistake. -Why would you do that? -Gio: It was a mistake. -Serge: Here's the thing. We did some market research, and what we need is you. Okay? Beautiful, Asian lady... -Victoria: What? -Serge: That people can see. People in my office. -Gio: So they say, "Oh! Oh, she's beautiful! Like..." -Victoria: Guys, I'm not -- I'm not Asian. I'm not Asian. -Gio: Don't be modest. -Serge: Don't be modest. -Victoria: No, I'm -- no, I'm telling you I'm not Asian. -Serge: Not at all? -Victoria: No! -Gio: No. You not a little happy? -I don't look Asian! -Oh, yeah. You do. -You have happy eyes. You're real skinny, with the happy eyes. -Victoria: Oh, of course I'm skinny. But I have huge, beautiful doll eyes. -Serge: Can I have that back? -No, no. You can't. -Serge: It was good seeing you. -Gio: Good seeing you. If you're ever at the El Toredo, mention us. You get 20 percent off appetizer. -So, now you don't want me because I'm not Asian? -Serge: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right. -Victoria: That was the whole point of this? You only ever wanted me because you thought I was Asian? -Serge: And a bitch, yeah. -Amir: I'm so close to selling this house to a celebrity lesbian couple. It's lesbians. And now, my favorite part of the house: master bedroom, where all the lesbian magic goes down. -Liz: Yeah. I mean, I think we'd flip this bed out for, like, a bigger bed 'cause we... -Jamie: Absolutely. -Liz: Keep a family bed with our dogs. -You can do whatever you want. You can do whatever you want. -Liz: I hate that you're saying that. -Jamie: You gotta stop saying that. -Amir: No, man. But I'm just saying gay people can do what they want. -Liz: But the way you're saying it... Do you know the tone of your voice that you're speaking? -Amir: A lot of people say I sound like Vin Diesel, like, when he's chilling out. -Liz: Um... -Amir: We also have an adjoining bathroom for lesbian... -Jamie: Right over... -Amir: Pee or poop. -Jamie: What -- what... -Glenn: Hey. Sorry. Um, I didn't mean to... Sorry. I didn't mean to impose. -Liz: No, that's okay. That's okay. -Glenn: I wrote a fan fiction script that actually takes place in between episodes two and three of "Butch & Cassidy." Um, I would be honored, and I'm sure everyone on my blog would be honored, if we could just re-enact a quick scene. -Amir: No. We're not gonna... -Liz: I will do it. I love that you're wearing the new hair piece. -Thank you. -Liz: That looks so good! -Glenn: Not gonna lie, my cousin did, uh, do some coloring to it, too. -Liz: Oh, my god! You know, it really matches. It blends. Do you wanna read as me? -Glenn: You want me to play you? -Liz: Yeah. If you feel like, take it away. You feel... You know, doesn't it feel right? Just explore it. -Glenn: You are the ranch hand that I want, that I need. -Jamie: You're always talking to me in the barn. You never pay attention to me in the saloon. -Liz: You're coming with me. And then you're coming with me. -Amir: Bravo, guys. That was really something! That was horrible, but it gives me an idea. I'm so glad that Glenn is here, actually, because Glenn is exactly the type of person that you were saying you wanted to not have access to your home, a super fan. Hey, Glenn, what would you do if you saw that fence out there? Would you try to climb it to see these girls? -Glenn: Oh, there's no way I could climb that fence. -Amir: Glenn, there's bougainvillea flowers over there, full of pollen. Would you ever try to climb that? -Glenn: God, no. My allergies would get in the way. I'd make it half-way up, and I'd fall back down. -Amir: Yeah. And there's a gate in the front. What if you didn't have the key to that gate? -Glenn: Get back in my car and drive away. -Amir: Ladies, as you see here, this house is perfect to keep out scum bags like Glenn. I made the sale! We make a pretty good team. Finally, Glenn's obsessive, borderline stalker-ish behavior pays off! ♪♪ -Roger: Mm. I once bet an executive that he couldn't tell the difference between his wife blowing him or me. Guess who won? He's no longer married, by the way. -Chelsea: Roger has been here, like, a week. And all I've seen him do is try to bang every woman who walks by. So far, he's one for 23. I guess the cleaning lady is dealing with some stuff. -Baxter: That's his third steak this morning. -Victoria: Are you serious? -Chelsea: Yeah. -Andrew: And his second bottle of Johnny Walker. -Amir: Uh, I'm sorry, miss. Hospice is on the second floor. Can someone light a scented candle, please? Uh, excuse me. But is this the real estate place? -Amir: Yes. And we only sell high-end real estate. -Ethyl: Well, I -- I just wanted... -Roger: Excuse me. Yes, ma'am, what did you need? -Ethyl: Is this where you sell houses? -Roger: This is where we sell houses. Ignore this punk, He wouldn't know the difference between a lady and a street walker.
