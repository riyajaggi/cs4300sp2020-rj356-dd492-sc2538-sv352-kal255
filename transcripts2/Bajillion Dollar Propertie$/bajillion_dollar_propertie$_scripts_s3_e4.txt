 a meeting in the bullpen, and no one knows what it's about. Dean: [ Sighs ] Thank you all for being here. As you may or may not know, the city of Los Angeles has bestowed upon me the great honor of being the first responder. Victoria: Mm. [ Clapping ] Dean: Not a first responder, but the first responder. Let's just say it's who you know. Anyway, I was the one who pulled that fire alarm because I wanted to see how we were doing in terms of emergency-drill preparedness. Chelsea: [ Sighs ] Dean: And it turns out, most of you... have done quite well, and thank you very much. Chelsea: Thank you.

If this is gonna take longer, I could leave you here, 'cause there's actually a taco buffet at Taco Mania that I usually hit on Tuesday mornings. And it's, uh -- Merry: He brought up tacos. Andrew: I bet if I self-narrate, too, I can get out of here in time for the salsa-chugging contest. Uhh...he could tell that she was interested in the property, and he would have to show her around the rest of the...house in order to make the deal. Uhh...
