 ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION, AND INCIDENTS PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS {\an8}EPISODE 11 Who are you people? You're not cops. You seem like bad guys. What do you do? We helped you escape from the cops. So I guess I can say that we're allies. I heard you're famous in the slums. You can and will do anything for money.

 You don't have a home or a family. You sleep curled up in your car and run errands for others to make a living. You live in the gutter not knowing what your parents look like. And you're dying soon? Don't you think life is too cruel? Will it ever be your turn to receive the organ transplant? You just... hurt my feelings. I may use people's weaknesses, but I never poke others' wounds. You're a douchebag. I refuse to be your ally. I always meet the right people. Were you praying?

 JEONG TAE-EUL What is this? You went to the trouble of photoshopping my face to bullshit me? This girl is you. You in the other world, to be exact. However, her life is very different from yours. She grew up healthy and happy with loving parents. These are your parents that you've never seen them before. You're not that bitch I saw in front of KU. Do you have a twin sister? I'll give you a new life. Just nod if you want that life. Fortune has arrived knocking at your door. How nice. She had everything. This pisses me off. I'm actually hurt. Prince Buyeong, who's known as Professor Lee Jong-in, was found dead in his residence last night. The Royal Court hasn't announced the exact cause of death. The police and prosecution have stated that King Lee Gon has full authority over all matters about the case and that he'll investigate the cause of death himself. I return to Amitabha Who guides me to the pure land I return to the two bodhisattvas On his left and right I return... Happy New Year, Your Majesty. We are gathered here to wish the deceased A good rebirth And the earliest opportunity To attain Nirvana Led by King Lee Gon Of the Kingdom of Corea This funeral for Prince Buyeong A royal relative... Prime Minister Koo. You smiled just now. I did? Rest in peace and attain Nirvana I quite enjoy seeing Lee Gon in despair. Prime Minister Koo, KU Group's chief secretary stopped by. Two hours ago. I was told to make sure you get this today. Just leave it there. I'll take a quick break, so don't disturb me. Yes, ma'am. Aren't my secretaries so capable? The customer who left the umbrella came to get it a few days ago. He looked just like Lee Lim when he was alive. So I thought maybe he had a son. So, Mom was right? US PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS NORTH KOREA What's the connection between these two? I sent the 2G phone to myself via registered mail before I came here. If the recipient can't be reached, they'll keep it at the post office after two delivery attempts. They're probably still trying. Are you going to get me out now? Of course, I'll get you out. Corpses are removed immediately. Are you looking for something specific? If your skin is on the dry side, would you like to try this? Now? It's very dry outside, isn't it? This is Golden Time Mist Ampoule. Please close your eyes. I'll try it myself. Spray it right after washing your face, and it'll hydrate... Hey, Jangmi. She's on your left. - Her outfit matches yours. - Okay, got it. Move along. No photos, please! Did you just abduct her? No, we arrested her. Oh, right. We're cops. - I'm sorry. - Thanks for your cooperation. And for this too. It is very hydrating indeed. The Royal Wardrobe sent your clothes for the New Year's ceremony. I thought I should drop it off myself so that I could see you. Oh, is today that day? The day when Prime Minister Koo stays up all night with His Majesty? You obviously came here because it makes you uneasy. Because of that wench, Koo Seo-ryeong? Gosh, of course not. I'm glad you're here. I knew it was around this time, so I was waiting for you. The gamhongro has aged very well. Has His Majesty left the study? Yes, just in time on Thursday night. Prime Minister Koo is pretty, but she has no other good qualities. She is sly and vulpine. And if you look at her closely, she's not even that pretty. I know. I understand. She doesn't have any health problems. We gave her a tranquilizer along with vitamin infusions. And Dr. Hwang said he'll return to the palace as soon as Prince Buyeong's autopsy is done. I love you. I am deeply... in love with you. I could tell that he was not from a different world, but from a different time. Perhaps, that was the day when I made up my mind about a lot of things. Am I getting dumped like this? No way. I'll show you once you're back. FORENSICS TEAM, GYEONG-RAN Hey, it's me. Did you hear? Jang Yeon-ji committed suicide at the penitentiary. - Suicide? - Yes. I just got a call from Seongdong-gu's forensics team. Hold on. Jang Yeon-ji took her own life. Hey, go on. But there was a power outage that day, so there's no CCTV footage. You didn't harass or mistreat her when you were there, right? I heard you visited her. Suicides are rare at penitentiaries, you know. They might investigate you for use of force, so be careful. Okay. Thanks, Gyeong-ran. I have to go. They got rid of her to cut the tail off. Let's go. Go where? It's not even within our jurisdiction. Not there. Let's find Song Jeong-hye first. The cinerarium may have her contact info as the guardian. Who is Song Jeong-hye? Lee Ji-hun's mother. The cinerarium you went to. That boy. But if she's Lee Ji-hun's mom... Right. She looks exactly like Lee Gon's mother, which means she's most likely with Lee Lim now. The address is useless. I went and only saw farmland. Just a moment. It's the management office. Hello? - Are you the one who called? - Yes, I am. I'm Lieutenant Jeong of Jongno. I see. I looked into what you asked about, but we have no contact info on file for Lee Ji-hun. We've been receiving five years' worth of payments up front. Always in cash. I never thought of that. Then could we check your security camera footage? Not this place. Just the ones from your parking lot. - We'll be there. - Okay, see you there. We need the footage from here. We don't know what she looks like. I do. By the way, who is Lee Lim? The instigator behind it all. And I think... he's the one who brought you here. This was in the pocket. I didn't come for that. You can keep it. Use it to protect what belongs to you. You know where my car is, right? You can have that too. And everything inside the car. All I ask for in return is that you feed Luna. Going off to steal again? Do you believe... God exists? Then I'll be punished. By the way, that yo-yo... Why is the string red? I hooked it up myself. Who taught you that expression? Hook it up again. It might break. Bye. All right, bye. He practically disowned his son and devoted his life to the Royal Court. A member of the royal family wore this? And look at these furniture pieces. Goodness. Did you read the article today? "Passed away at 76, a righteous, humble life devoted to the nation and Royal Court." "Righteous"? Sure. But why did the word, "humble," have to go in there? You folks worked him like a dog until he was almost 80. "Humble"? He was just used. My father was used. It's New Year's Day. We'll visit you. Se-jin misses you a lot. Just send Se-jin, then. You cannot come here. You cannot set foot in the Kingdom of Corea. Dad, why are you being like this? We follow the rule of primogeniture, so I'll be next in line when you're gone. Will you seriously let all that money fall into Gon's lap? Let me say this again. I cannot let you come anywhere near the Royal Court, no matter what. I have to go. I can move into this house, right? I'm selling my house in LA. I'll also close my clinic as soon as my return date is set. I should take over the royal physician role and manage the foundation as well. You should announce the new director and the order of succession on the same day. Seung-heon. Yes, Your Majesty. You cannot enter the Kingdom of Corea. - Your Majesty... - And you won't succeed the throne. Se-jin is next in line to the throne. Nonsense. Says who? You must leave immediately after the 49th-day memorial service. I will let you maintain your dignity as a member of the Royal Family. Gon, how dare you... - Hey... - Is anybody outside? I want a report on every move of Prince Buyeong's eldest son until the 49th-day memorial service. And he shall leave the country as soon as the service is over. - Yes! - Yes! Wait, Your Majesty. Your Majesty! Hey, step aside! Move! Please spare me a second. Your Majesty! Your Majesty. I suppose the autopsy is done. I'm ready to listen. The cause of death was asphyxiation caused by strangulation, and strong force applied to the neck. This was found on the corpse. It seems someone put it on his finger after he died. Also, no hesitation wounds were found on the Royal Guards who were killed. They were slain in one blow with a sharp blade. Lee Lim will not hide, and he does not intend to hide anything. He is... calling me to stand on my father's blood. He is provoking me using my uncle's blood. Lee Lim. My gosh! Your Majesty. When did he get here? No idea. He startled me. Your Majesty, in the garden... My apologies. I was distracted for a moment. Sub-captain Seok. I'll be away. I'll try to come back soon, but it may take a while. You won't be able to reach me. Officially, I'm in the study... Your Majesty. You need to see this. This news has been circulating since this afternoon. These were released all at once. This is intentional, Your Majesty. Prime Minister Koo has pulled the gag. She wants to tie me down. - Call her office now. - Yes, Your Majesty. This is the Royal Court. The King is asking for her. A sick day? Prime Minister Koo? Anyway, okay. - Your Majesty. - I heard. Find her and put her on the phone. Yes. Sub-captain Seok. Bring me the daily log of the team that guarded Prince Buyeong. For the past six months. Yes, Your Majesty! The evening pills contain a sleep inducer, so take them on time. Who are you? Why are you tailing me? I bet this isn't the first time. Pick it up. That will be best for both of us. All right, well done. Now, listen up. That broken bottle makes this special violence. And you're holding my wallet, so this is also robbery. See this blood? Infliction of bodily injury. So, everything I do from this moment on will be execution of duties. Goddamnit. Oh, right. I'm not supposed to kill you. Who told you not to kill me? I should thank that person. Just someone… always by your side. Who are you, really? If you let me go now, this phone will ring. But if you arrest me, this phone won't ring. Forever. I'm just curious. Who pays the phone bill? You can't catch me anyway. 031G 7370 031G 7370 Now, describe the process of the arrest. Write down when and how it was done. Okay. On January 30, we staked out a skincare store near Jongno Station. Lieutenant Jeong sprayed facial mist with her eyes open. Jangmi. Lieutenant Jeong bravely sprayed facial mist... Jangmi? Sin-jae! What happened? Sin-jae! Gosh! Come and sit here. - What happened? - What kind of bastard... Tell me. I will destroy that bastard. I'll bring the car over. Dress the wound and come outside. Okay. You should've gone to the hospital. Why come here? Don't make me talk. It hurts. Take this. Dust it for prints. You can disregard mine though. This is... Yes, what they have in common. It came to me as well. Aren't we going to the hospital? Let's go. This hurts a lot. Gosh, seriously. - Jangmi, hurry. - Yes! I'm on my way! I got the direction wrong. I dodged to the right instead of left. Don't call my mom. And don't tell Chief Park. That guy, Jo Yeong, too. Just don't tell anyone. Come on. Jangmi knows. Oh, right. You look more injured. What happened? What do you mean the phone came to you? It must be that bastard. The one who brought me here. Lee Lim. He sent me someone. That man said the phone will ring. I wonder why they approached me. Will I really get a call? Suggest meeting up to discuss the details. And tell him to bring his prettiest friend. Let's catch them all at once. What are we after? And where are we headed? I don't have the exact answer to that yet. So I'll just keep going. I was told that we'll arrive somewhere if we keep going. If we walk far enough, that is. - Who said that? - Alice in Wonderland. I think you're bullshitting me, but I didn't read it. Gosh, this hurts. {\an8}PRINCE BUYEONG'S SECURITY TEAM DAILY LOG I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I cannot get a hold of Prime Minister Koo. She hasn't left her residence, and she's having all reports sent to her electronically. Should I send someone? No, there is no need. She's trying to get back at me by doing exactly what I did. It seems like she's trying to go somewhere with this, so we shall wait. SECURITY TEAM DAILY LOG BUSAN, THE SLUMS, EOSU BOOKSTORE "The slums, Eosu Bookstore." It's the only place he visited in Busan. What could this mean? This move Uncle Buyeong made… I'll look into it right now. The footsteps you take by risking your whole life is what's fate. He knew I'd check the daily log. Team One, get armed and follow me. Yes, Your Majesty! Team One, be armed and get ready immediately. I'm asking you this to save lives, not because I don't know. Do you know Eosu Bookstore? The one who answers first will live. If you stay silent, you will be beheaded. I do not know. I really don't know anything. I've never even been to a bookstore. You can't kill me because you need to interrogate me to reach Prince Imperial Geum. I don't care what you know because that information won't help me reach Lee Lim. You obviously only know what can be spilled. And most importantly, I no longer want any information from you. Then pull the trigger. Do it! Go ahead and kill me if you think you can! Yes, I will kill you. Your Majesty, please spare my life. They lied to me about this place. I want to go back. I'll go back, Your Majesty! It's too late. You're already dead in that world. You committed the crime yourself, so I'm sure you know it well. You two have caused chaos in both worlds. You will pay for what you did here. Your Majesty. Spare my life. Please spare me! Spare me, Your Majesty. Please! Please spare me, Your Majesty! You'll behead me? Bullshit. Beheading was abolished ages ago in the Kingdom of Corea! You forgot because you're a traitor's henchman. The king's words are the law. Royal Guards. Kim Gi-hwan, the traitor's henchman who chose silence… shall be beheaded. It's the king's order. Breaking news. The Royal Court's spokesperson announced that Kim Gi-hwan, a traitor's follower, has been arrested. - The spokesperson also stated - My gosh. - That Kim will be beheaded according to - That's ruthless. The special law. This means that he will be executed according to the Criminal Act. The execution will take place at midnight tonight. This law has never been put to use before since King Lee Gon's enthronement. It is being used for the first time in 62 years. Did you make steak and rice for Seo-ryeong or not? You didn't prepare the rice in that uniform, did you? I rinsed the rice, and then put on the uniform. And what did you say? You put it on "at the most honorable moment"? It's true. The moment I propose to the love of my life, for example. You didn't wear it for me. I couldn't. I was in a hurry. It's the best thing I've done since coming to this world. I'm waiting for your answer, and the story earlier was a joke. You call that a proposal? You never asked me to be your queen. You just told me to do it. So what's your answer? Will you do it? I'm going to punch you. Will you do it? If I say no, will I never see you again? So, it's a no? Not today. I've been thinking. I'm just going to live for today and not think about anything else. As if today is the only ordinary day where we're allowed to be scandalous. That's what we should do. Let's just do that. In moments like this, couples pledge their eternal love. But we'll only live for today? That's right. There's no tomorrow for us. That's why I'm hoping today is a long day. That's why I'm holding your hand. Because we'll only live today. And yet we'll only hold hands and do nothing else? Do you know what "scandalous" means? You ditched me even when we were alone at your palace. You should have asked me to stay. I was being considerate of you. Next time, I won't be so considerate. There's no next time. I told you that we'll only live for today. Gosh, where do I even start with you? Hey. Stop. Have patience with me. I'm a fast learner. I know you can hear me. Hey. Excuse me! Excuse me. Yes, can I help you? Nice to meet you. I'm Seo-ryeong, the prime minister of the Kingdom. Sorry to bother you. I'll have to check your ID. I'm a police officer. Don't the police usually show their badges first? You look more like a criminal than a cop. Yes. I'm Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul from Jongno. You really are a cop. This has never happened to me before. {\an8}RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD KOO EUN-A, 820726 What is your date of birth? July 26, 1982. Did I do something wrong? No, it's fine. You may move along. I don't even know why I got so nervous. Bye now. I'll take these, and could you throw those out? Sure. KOO EUN-A, 820726-20 BOMUN-DONG 6-GA, 486? 466? UNIT 303 DAD Hi, Dad. I'm on my way now. I'll meet you at the store. What's the mushroom that forms liquid when you grill? Pine mushrooms? - These are king oyster mushrooms. - Hey, hold on. This is great for boosting your stamina. There. Go. - Dad, seriously! - What? We'll eat pork. Why do you buy chicken? We can eat this tomorrow. Hey, can't you just splurge? - Goodness. - Put it down. Hello, welcome. Can I see the menu? It's my first time here. Here you go. Hey, you. 57247093699959574966967627 72407663033547594571382179 So, it's 3,481 seconds. I missed the beginning, but the second time... She thinks you left again... For 121 seconds. Then for 841 seconds. And 961 seconds. Then 2,209 seconds. And lastly... The amount of frozen time is multiplying by the square root of the prime number. At this rate, time will stop for a whole day the 62nd time it happens. In other words, there will come a moment when the worlds, both Tae-eul's and mine, will stop forever. Your Majesty. We've found where Eosu Bookstore is. This prick is the owner. He's alive? Tell me what to do. How dare you... Your Highness! He was alive this whole time. EOSU BOOKSTORE Tonight, we will raid Eosu Bookstore, the hideout of the traitor's followers. Everything is clear. Should we capture them alive? Kill them. Why do I keep getting the same thing? There you are. Come to daddy. Damn it. The bookstore? Me? Why? Is that prick acting up? He's no longer useful. I need you to take care of that bookstore. See? I told you. I don't have to take anything, right? When should I go? What do I do when I'm there? This is why I said... you never know what someone is really thinking. Check his left shoulder for a gunshot wound. There's nothing. Eight. Car keys. Those with the same faces are stealing lives… of their counterparts. Sub-captain Seok. Retreat immediately and assemble all Royal Guards. The infantry unit and cavalry unit are to be on standby, fully armed. Hang in there just a little longer, Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul. I'm coming for you. I will find you no matter what. Please just be there, no matter where you are. What are you doing here, kiddo? Get out of here. I warn people of danger and defeat the enemy. What? By the way, you're in this world too. There's only one of me. I went to the other world. I'm restoring balance. There are too many enemies. You... What is going on? Who are you? Run! She's up! Get her! - You little... - Get her! Shit, my phone. How do I get to Seoul? BUSAN PALACE What? "Busan Palace"? Am I in the Kingdom now? The bookstore... Even the ones inside the building were shot to death. I thought he was a benevolent ruler. Who knew my nephew could be such a blood-thirsty tyrant? We lost the woman. I sincerely apologize. We are chasing her, so... She must be headed to the main palace. Catch her. Gon will come even for her corpse, so bring her to me dead or alive I must obtain something in exchange for her! - Yes, Your Highness! - Yes, Your Highness! CALL THIS NUMBER TO WISH HIS MAJESTY A HAPPY NEW YEAR Wish the king of the Kingdom of Corea a happy new year after the tone. Gon. It's me, Jeong Tae-eul. You won't believe me, but I'm in the Kingdom of Corea now. I'm being chased by someone. I'm headed to the palace now. I'll hurry. I'm on my way there now... Message recorded. Thank you for using our service. So look for me when you get this message. Protect her! She is the future queen. {\an8}She's the woman I love. {\an8}Why are cracks appearing? {\an8}Just kill me! {\an8}We each have a piece of something we both want. {\an8}What is your real name? {\an8}-A déjà vu? - I saw myself just now. {\an8}Na-ri! {\an8}Why would you mistake me for someone else? {\an8}So if you lose it, the door closes. {\an8}If that door closes... {\an8}I think it was fate. {\an8}I'll open all the doors in the universe.
