 You kill the living, but you keep me alive every time I try to die. I guess you'll really become a god. I'll take care of the rest. Let her go. Hang this up. That cabinet will do. Where is Mr. Yu when we need him? He quit. There's a new manager now. She's Ms. Baek. - A déjà vu? - Yes. A déjà vu occurs when your frequency matches that of another world and you get a glimpse of yourself in that world. You know that I used to be in the radio club?

 Why are you mentioning about it? I saw myself just now. But I was with someone who looks exactly like you. My doppelganger had short hair, and yours was in a hospital gown. A hospital gown? Na-ri! Right, you're injured. So you could be delirious from a fever. And this has happened twice already, so I have to ask. Who is Na-ri? Why do people keep calling me Na-ri? Myeong Seung-a, a newcomer at Public Affairs. We talk formally. She's good at work and with words. I meant ordinary, not Na-ri. I meant that I want to get better and go back to my ordinary life. Should I tell you how someone who's a bad liar like you can get out of a situation like this? It's finally time for you to ask for my number. - It's 010... - So it was you. - The person he was talking about. - She has pretty eyes. Excuse me? Hey, newbie. Protect your phone number. Don't give it out to other guys. Damn, I thought I was going to get caught. She looks exactly like Na-ri. Wow. Even across different worlds, she's still pretty... Na-ri... How are you... Na-ri, Na-ri... Jo Eun-sup... He seems a bit strange these days. Does he have another weird dream? Hello, welcome. Can I see the menu? It's my first time here. Here you go. What's this? It's the most popular milk tea. There are chewy tapioca pearls and soft pudding inside. It sounds like a foreign language. But it sounds interesting. I'll have that to go. It's 5,800 won. Here. Please wait a moment. Hey, you're here. Hang on. Eun-bi and Kka-bi aren't here yet. Why did you come so early? I want my japchae! What are you talking about? You told me to come get some japchae. You said you'd give me some. Come on. Here's your drink. I'm sorry. We're childhood friends. I see. It's good. Come again. Can't you see I have a customer? And why did you cut your hair so short? Let me borrow your car. The one out there. Nonsense. You don't have a license. DRIVER'S LICENSE JO EUN-SUP VIP escort vehicle is crossing through Naegok. It's heading for the National Security Agency. Hang in there, Lieutenant Jeong. I'm coming for you. I promise I will find you. I want you all to use big data to find the person in this photo. It's very urgent. This isn't an order, but a request. - Yes! - Yes! Could I have the data? It's a photo of a security footage, so it's not very clear. Could it still work? Yes, it's possible. But since we don't have the exact location of the target, it may take some time. I understand. Your Majesty, there's a call for you. Yes, Yeong. Sir, Detective Kang called again. He said something about finding Luna. They were chasing her and causing a huge racket. Tell him to call me right now. And keep your voice low. Is there a quiet room and a laptop I could use? I'll have them ready right away. I checked the video. It's near the Busan palace. Yes. If you look at the 15th second in the third file, it's Luna for sure. She's not the one you've been looking for, but thank you. Right... What? Take care, then. I'll thank you in person later. I got info on the target's attire. A grey hoodie, training pants, and white sneakers. She has her hair tied in a ponytail. Check the routes from the Eastern Market to the main palace. TAE-EUL SIN-JAE Jo Eun-sup? It's Jo Yeong. Detective Jeong isn't picking up. Please come to Yeouido. I need your help. Do you have Eun-sup's phone? What's going on? - You'll have to owe me, though. - I'll be waiting. Go on and get some rest. - You've done a good job today. - It's nothing. Did you find out? I hope it's news that will put me back on my feet. I checked the alibis of the workers who changed their shifts. There was nothing in particular about Gi-yun, Do-gyeong, and Su-a. So There was something about Park Suk-jin? She only went out twice recently to a bookstore in the slums. And the days she left were when His Majesty's schedule was empty. After she left the bookstore, she was burning this. And I'm reporting this to you today because that bookstore was where the traitor's henchmen were staying. What? How could someone like her have worked here at the palace? Hired as a national contributor's descendant, she was Park Dong-u's granddaughter. But she was not his real granddaughter. What are you talking about? The real Park is living in Pyongan under the name of Min Seon-yeong. And there's a record of Min having lost her son a long time ago. What? Min Seon-yeong? I was so thorough when hiring workers in the palace, but it was you! What is your real name? Are you Min Seon-yeong, who lost a son a long time ago? Keep your mouths shut! If even a word about this incident leaves the palace, I will punish you and your family for three generations! - Yes, Lady Noh. - Yes, Lady Noh. Call the palace doctor. And take her to the secondary palace. We must keep her alive. I have to find out and reveal who tried to keep her mouth shut. Hey! Can't you drive properly? I could've died! You can't die here, Prime Minister Koo. Do I look like a government official? I think you're mistaken. - I don't think I am. - You're mistaking me with someone else. Why do you mistake me for someone else? It's dangerous. The police is here! Over here! Someone's hurt! Hurry! What was that gunshot? Jo Yeong! Hey, stay with me! Hey! This is a drill. You can go. He's fine. It's a drill. Are you sure you don't need a doctor? The hospitals here are great. Bullet-proof vests from the Kingdom are great. I don't have any fractures or organ damages. I only have a ruptured ligament, so it's fine. You don't see a doctor after being shot. Where you come from? I deleted the dashcam footage. Give it back to Na-ri. And be honest now. What kind of country has shootouts like that? Explain yourself or give me an excuse. Or you'll be arrested. It won't happen again. I'll explain when His Majesty returns. When's he coming back? I get this for saving you? I can't use my hand. Can you open the lid? You can get beheaded for referring to the king like that. He's your king, not mine. Don't you remember? He was your king, and you saw him crying. How long have you been a guard? Since I was four. Don't be ridiculous. From now on, you're the Unbreakable Sword. He was eight, and I was four. I saw His Majesty at his coronation. That's when I thought that I wanted him to be happy. I think it was fate. I don't know what to say. It's such a different world from mine. Are you two dating? Rumors like that do exist. But it's the same for you and Lieutenant Jeong. You protect the law and justice with your lives. For me, that's the king. By the way, why was he crying then? It was his first duty as the king. The funeral of the former king. So he doesn't have a father? What happened? He was killed by his brother. And His Majesty saw it all. So since then, he has been sleeping with the thought of death. Protect her! She is the future queen. So the palace is the safest home for him, and the most dangerous battlefield as well. But now it seems like he has enetered a new battlefield. If that is his destiny, I must follow him, whatever that battlefield may be. Let me skip the thanks. You're skipping so much. I missed you. I missed you. I missed you. And the gun. There are two bullets left. Let's go to the palace. Jeong Tae-eul. Sub-captain Seok. Take care of things here, and Maximus too. Yes, Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Dr. Hwang is here, and I have a guest room ready. No, I'm taking her to my chambers. Bring Dr. Hwang to the king's chambers right now. Your Majesty! What happened? Blood! My goodness. It's not my blood. What? Are you all right? Every woman I like is unwell. My goodness. Were you here the whole time? You should've just come inside. You told me to leave. I've treated her wounds, and she'll soon recover from dehydration. She just fell asleep. Why don't you go inside? I should go and get Dr. Hwang something to eat. Thank you. Thank you for your work. This way, Dr. Hwang. Oh, my head. Get some more sleep. You want me to sleep when I've met you again at last? I look awful, don't I? Not at all. You look like a huge bandage right now. But you're a really pretty bandage. But how did you find me? I told you I'm a decent person here. I drank water at the Taekwondo center and lost consciousness. I now know the importance of food tasters. You can tell me about it later. You can tell me when you're all better. I thought it would've been our last moment together. That time in the bamboo forest. Lots of things happened while we were apart. That's why I couldn't go back. That's a relief. I thought that door had closed. Don't worry. If that door closes, I'll open all the doors in the universe. And I'll come to you. Please do. But what about Eun-sup? Well... He's in the hospital. He's all right, though. Like I said, many things happened. I see. When I wake up, let's go and see Eun-sup first. I miss him. Are you saying you miss another guy? Jo Yeong is doing all right, too. Yeong... I like you more than Yeong. That's such a lie. Sorry. It hurts. What? "Sorry"? You opened your eyes. I wanted to see your eyes again. - Get out. - This is my room. Oh, really? Then I should take a look around tomorrow. I hope there's a lot of jewelry here. JINSUN PARTY His Majesty just caused a huge commotion. It was shocking enough that he caught the traitor's followers himself, but announcing the queen? Nobody imagined such things happening. Announcing the queen after so much blood was shed… That's a very symbolic show of action. We must find out what kind of family that woman is from. By the way, how long is Ms. Koo going to stay cooped up? The queen was announced, and her approval ratings are falling. All her efforts went to waste, so no wonder she fell ill. It'll be a headache if an outsider gains power. Even a prime minister from a fish shop was a headache. All right. We have to find out her age, alma mater, family, job, anything. CALL HISTORY HOW TO RAISE A MAGIC LILY {\an8}JANGMI Chief, what should I order for everyone? I had a homemade meal. Ox knee soup for me. What about the other two? One of you two read my message. Can't you at least send a reply? An exclamation mark is fine too. I'll accept question marks too. Crying face... Mr. Kang, you're here. Did you get my message? I'm trying to order food. You can eat first. What about Tae-eul? What? You don't know, either? Tae-eul took a vacation. What? A vacation? Yes. She used all 21 days. Why are you taking turns doing this to me? - Hey. Your wild ideas... - I'm getting some fresh air. Don't worry. And your anxious eyes are driving me crazy. - This won't do. - What should I do? Let's have a team dinner today. We can go singing later. It'll be good. - Where are you? Answer my call. - My gosh. I was removing your IV as you're done with it. Right. Thank you. Nice to see you again. Right. His Majesty ordered me to escort you once you wake up. Oh, right. Thank you. Where is he right now? Is there something going on? Well... His Majesty is washing rice in his navy uniform. What? You're awake. You should've come earlier. I washed a whole bag of rice. Where are you going? I've been doing this for you to see. Don't leave! I can't feel my fingers now. Hey. - All right. Hurry it up then. - What are we to do? You said you'll only live for today. I wanted you to laugh, although I laughed more than you. I couldn't leave because I was hungry. How can you be so dramatic? That's why I make such a great king. If I take the MBTI personality test, my type would be "the king." Didn't I tell you I'm easily irritated before meals? All right. Enjoy your meal. But it might not have been me. What would you have done if it was the other me? I'm... dating someone in another world. And she always ties her hair at important moments. But she always leaves out some strands. And she doesn't know it because she can't see it herself. And? She prefers beer to tea when having a conversation. And she likes to mix drinks. She mixes drinks seriously. She shakes the glass excitedly, and drinks it quickly. But when courage is needed, she becomes a warrior. She's like that. Let's go see Eun-sup when I'm done eating. But one big flaw is that she only says what she wants to say whether I make her food or express my love to her. By the way, are my clothes being washed? They weren't in the room. I got clothes that match your usual style. Wear anything you want. Why did you only get styles I usually wear? You could get different styles, too. Don't you have any dresses? They are over there. I was kidding. I'll wear this. I knew you'd say that so I was showing off all the pretty dresses I have. What's that? When do you wear that? At the most glorious moment. For example, when I'm holding flowers in my hand? What flowers do you like? I just remembered that I never gave you flowers before. So I crossed the universe. I don't like flowers. Let's go. I want to see Eun-sup. Fine. Show her the fitting room. Yes. This way, ma'am. His Majesty said he'd like it if you put on every item he's prepared. All of it. Didn't you find anything in your clothes? Like a box. It's a plum blossom, right? It's really pretty. It's so pretty that I want to wear it on a glorious day, too. When I don't have any wounds. But how did you know I'd pick this outfit? I know everything. Let's go. Eun-sup will be waiting. Captain Jo. His Majesty will arrive soon. He took the elevator downstairs. All right. I'll do the security check. He did the security check like this. Eun-sup. What? Whose voice is this? Tae-eul! What's going on? Is this a dream? Is it really you, Tae-eul? How have you been? I heard you were really courageous. Listen carefully. Someone was shooting at him, and I could see the bullet flying. So my instincts kicked in... What happened to you, though? You came here like this? Something came up. It looks like you'll get a big promotion here. Well, if I just put my mind to it, a top rank position will be a piece of cake. What's that? Is that for me? The roll cake you wanted. I went to the Royal Bakery myself and got it made just for you. Wow, you really didn't have to. All right. Cut me a large piece. I'm afraid I can't do that. But I could buy you the bakery if you want. Really? You better mean it. I really respect you, sir. I lost my chance to have a canned peach company last time. I was so upset. Then next time, ask him to open a car door for you. Wow. Why didn't I think of that? What is this? How can this taste so luxurious? Eun-bi and Kka-bi would love this if they tried it. Eun-bi and Kka-bi are eating well, attending kindergarten well, and they're bright. And it seems like Eun-bi found out Yeong isn't you. Gosh, I told him to be careful. Aren't you asking about Na-ri? Na-ri? Na-ri? Oh, well. I haven't thought about her at all... - I don't miss... - She's not getting along with Yeong. - What? - She says he's not as handsome as before. I actually told him that his style won't do. I knew that would happen. Sir, can you open the bathroom door for me? The spot where I got hit is suddenly hurting. This hospital is pretty huge. What? No! What's this? Why are you doing that? I guess the one who took me here is Lee Lim. Do you have any idea why? Did you see the umbrella that he was holding? The umbrella? I didn't actually see him. I only saw his men. I told you last time that we each have a piece of something we both want. I think he hid it in his umbrella. And me... You hid it in your whip. He would've realized by now where mine is. That's why he brought me here. To make a deal. So if you lose it, the door closes on your side. Yes. So now the fight is about who steals the other's piece first? No. It's about not losing mine. It's an all-or-nothing fight. But you'd be at a disadvantage in this fight. You'd have to carry that when you're visiting me. That's why you shouldn't treat me harshly. Don't worry. I won't lose anything that belongs to me. But if you're still worried, why don't we go and pray? Let's pray for God's blessing on us. I searched for this place in your world. This church is the only place that's the same in both worlds. Really? Why did you search for this church? This is where my parents got married. My father saw my mother lecturing at a seminar and fell in love at first sight. It was the World Academy of Sciences. My mother was a scientist. So you take after your mother. Yes. My father proposed to her, but my mother was Catholic. So my father studied the religion for six months. He came here every single week. Wow. So they got married and had me. But my mother passed away three years later. She had been frail from birth. I don't remember it, but everyone knows it, and it's my first time sharing this. But it's nice that you're the one I'm telling this story to. You've turned out great, Gon. We skipped a lot of things. When I was five, my parents ran the Taekwondo center together. My mother was a really popular instructor. But she died of cancer. I'm still wearing my mother's black belt. You've turned out great, Tae-eul. Your Majesty? Hello, Father. I wasn't notified of your visit. It's not an official schedule. I was just passing by. Are you good at keeping secrets, by any chance? Pardon? God told me to set a guard over my mouth and keep watch over the door of my lips. Then would you take a photo for me? I want a photo of us together. All right. "What is your reason for doing that? You were sitting alone by the stream. The green grass was sprouting and the water was splashing from the spring breeze. You promised that even if you go, you won't be gone forever. That is what you promised. I sit by the stream each day and think about something endlessly. When you promised that even if you go, you won't be gone forever, were you asking me not to forget you?" It's all done. The medicine is for three days, and it contains antibiotics, so no alcohol. She asked about it... Alcohol? It's just for disinfection. I was going to have just one glass. It'll help with my blood circulation and let me recover quickly. I suddenly feel exhausted. You should go. I'll get some sleep. I told you that this is my room. Oh, right. Then where have you been sleeping? Here. Here? How? Next to you while you slept. - It's a big bed, you know. - Have you lost your mind? No wonder. People were giving me strange looks. Don't overreact. I didn't even hit you that hard. My shoulder is hurting like I've been burned. The scar that Yeong mentioned. Really? Let me see. Where is it? What's wrong? I think it's a side effect of crossing the road of thunder and lightning. What about you? Aren't you hurting? No, I feel fine. Look. Do I have a scar too? Oh, you startled me. You can see this much in the summer. - Look properly. - You're unbelievable. This hurts even more. You don't have one. I don't? Then is it a random thing? It's strange. This means it's not connected to crossing the two worlds. What about this? The phrase we use when cursing bad people. "I hope you get hit by lightning." - I wanted to stop beheading people. - Go ahead and try me. Hey, that's... I'm sure I told you that you could be beheaded for addressing me like that. Stop being ridiculous. Horrible weather, isn't it? I'm sorry. It's fine. I didn't see you either. Why? Why? Why are these cracks appearing here and there? Kill me. Just kill me! I didn't keep you alive just to kill you like this. You're the perfect bait. That's why I've kept you alive. If your son was alive, would he have grown up like him? You have the face of my nephew's mother. Welcome. Take a seat over there, please. Can't I use the room? The prime minister is using it right now. You mean Seo-ryeong? Without any guards? I want perilla seed noodles. It's been a while. I heard you were here alone. - Can I sit? - Whatever. I heard you were sick. Yes. This is my first meal. So let's not talk. I don't want my food to get cold. The seat isn't for you. It's for the baby. It must be a boy. I'm eating so much these days. I didn't check the gender. It's a girl. What? Did you order? It's coming soon. I heard you're visiting the Middle East with my husband. I guess Mr. Yoon is a family man. He talks about his work with you? He's wasting his time. Aren't you the icon of wasting time these days? It's too bad the four years of effort is going to waste. It seems you won't be the queen. What do you mean? You don't know? Were you really that sick? The king announced the future queen. Let me use your phone. You didn't even bring your phone? KING ANNOUNCES FUTURE QUEEN You should really serve another term. Or else you'll really just become a daughter of a fish shop owner. Good luck with the baby. Make sure to give birth in this Kingdom. What's she on about? Yes. All right. Keep that jerk's mouth shut. Your Majesty, Lee Sang-do is saying he's in pain. Pain? Yes, he feels burning and it happens when it rains. Your Majesty. Prime Minister Koo just entered the palace without a notice. I guess she finally feels better. Where is she right now? You were sick for a while. - Are you feeling all right? - Yes, Your Majesty. An unexpected piece of news made me get up. We'll go over that once I'm done talking. Prime Minister Koo. You eventually pulled the gag. What's your reason? For tying me down, I mean. If I hadn't tied you down, where would you have gone? To make a marriage proposal? All right. Let's talk about that first. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to talk. Everything in the news is true. She's the woman I love. I support her every step and every moment. You're always so honest, Your Majesty. It rains often since it's by the ocean. That's the only downside. Drink your tea. I'm sure you would have felt upset about how I treated you. I hope you understand that it was all to protect His Majesty. It's all right. I'm going to ask you something. Can you answer me without asking anything else? And don't talk about this to anyone. I'm willing to trust you because you seem to be a government official. Go ahead. My name is Noh Ok-nam. My father is Noh Gi-seop, my mother is Shin Jeong-ae, and my sister is Noh Yeong-nam. I was born in 1932, in Pyoksong of Hwanghae Province. I left my hometown at the age of 17, and I haven't heard any news of it for 67 years. So I want to ask... What happened to that war? The war that broke out in June, 1950. {\an8}His Majesty and Lieutenant Jeong… The two worlds are too far apart. {\an8}What will you do? Will you try to answer my question? {\an8}Is there even a way for us? {\an8}Stop acting so cocky and move. {\an8}Stop, Prime Minister Koo. {\an8}And if I stop you… {\an8}-Tae-eul. - Will you stay? {\an8}Should I tell you a secret before I die? {\an8}-I might find Lee Lim's bamboo forest. - What are these cracks? {\an8}-My counterpart. Did you meet her? - Should I stay just for today? {\an8}-We should see each other. - If you see me now, you die.
