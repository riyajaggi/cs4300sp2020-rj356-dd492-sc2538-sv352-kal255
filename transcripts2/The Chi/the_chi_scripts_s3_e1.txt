 Previously on The Chi... You got the chain that I gave him. Take the fucking chain, then. Take it! Every time I think about you, I wish something bad on you. I'm really sorry for killing your little brother. Man, Coogie was just, so much better than me, you know? I kissed her, but I only did it 'cause I felt sorry for her.

 Maisha, look, I didn't... You need to tell us who gave you the drugs, Kevin. I'm not snitching. I'm done doing that. Mrs. Williams, this is exactly why I recommend you consider sending him to Chicago North Side Academy. Ma! Oh! DaDarn... Oh, what the fuck? And you did this all by yourself? Yeah, we can figure this shit out together. Five laps. Let's go. Get a move on, Williams. You're laggin' behind. Look, I don't have nothing to do with this. I understand you're scared, but I will handle this.

 Miss Ethel's home invasion, gang's proceeds from dope and guns, and he's the scorpion. Hey, I remember you. You gave a pizza party at my school. How's school going anyway? It's good, I guess. Oh, we gotta be doing a lot better than "I guess." I'd like to give Jake a job. What the fuck he gonna do here? Don't underestimate your little brother. Let me ask you something, Douda. Is there anything that I can do different? You have nothing to worry about. "Endless Love" playing in my life that's right. Your sister's late. I knew it. She's gonna ruin my wedding. Calm down, Ma. She's probably on her way. I asked her to do one thing, be on time. She couldn't even do that. Okay, but you weren't prompt either. The wedding was supposed to start an hour ago. So? I'm the bride. I can be late. As one. In my arms. If you can't hustle in them heels, you should've wore flats. Shut up. You're the one who decided to cut your own hair at the last minute. I can't go to a wedding without a fresh line up. Who you think I am, Steph Curry? I thought I knew what love was my whole life, but then I found you, and you taught me the true definition of what it means to be loved completely. I never thought I would want to remarry. I thought if I was lucky enough to find love once I can't believe you made me late for my own friend's wedding. You wouldn't even know Dre if it wasn't for me. Yeah, you probably the reason she gay. Bullshit. I ain't turn her gay. She always been gay. I was just a speed bump on her way to the island of Lesbos. At this time, Dre would like to share a few words. Ay. Something I wanna say to both of you. I know y'all didn't get a chance to pick me. Your mother did. But when I chose your mother, I chose y'all too. I want you to know that I can't wait to be a part of this family. Kiesha, I know we don't always see eye to eye. But I have a lot of respect for you. You're a strong woman, just like your moms. You're smart, and you got a good heart. And, Kevin, whew, boy, you've been through a lot these past few years. But you're still the bravest person I know, and you're not afraid to go after whatever you want. Keep that energy. I look forward to all the wonderful things that's gonna happen in your lives. I want you to both know that I'll be here for you, anything you need. So... I got y'all a little something. Oh! Oh. Is this real gold? Yes, sir. Twentyfour karats. It's engraved with the longitude and latitude of our house, so no matter where you are in the world you can always find your way home. I love both of y'all with my whole heart. Thanks. By the power granted to me by the state of Illinois, I now pronounce you two honest women who are no longer shacking up out of wedlock. Congratulations. Whoo! Get you off my mind. Why we ain't never do that? Do what? Get married. You promising to be faithful is a lie nobody'd believe. They'd believe it more than you saying you'd obey. Obeying is for dogs. That's why you getting divorced now. I'm not divorced. I'm separated. Oh, uh, I'll be back. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You okay? You want me to go with you? Nah, I'ma go by myself. Text me when you get there. Through your hardships there's no guarantees break a promise down that aisle. I will be your defense till it all ends. This is a private service. I'm here to pay my respects. You can keep them. Excuse me. Hey, little man. You can vouch for me, can't you? Nah. How many of you mothers out there have lost a child? How many of you have had to bury two? It's like we part of some club nobody wants to belong to. Listen. Last time I was in this church, Brandon got up here and told the truth. I remember being mad as hell at his ass for doing it. But now I realize why he did it. He did it because at some point, we all get tired of lying. At some point, it's just easier to stop caring what everybody thinks and just speak. Look I didn't wanna have no kids. I knew I wasn't cut out to be somebody's mother. And that's 'cause nobody mothered me. Nobody ever loved me unconditionally. So I spent most of my youth a broken girl. I got some bright idea that having kids would make me whole. But I was wrong. After Brandon was born, I realized I had nothing to give him. So... I gave him my trauma. I gave him my pain. I gave him all the things that I didn't know what to do with. And you know what he did with it? He made it something beautiful. He used my pain as fuel for his dreams. He tried to escape all the bad things in his life. He tried to run away from them. But he could never outrun me. He couldn't save his brother. He couldn't love Jerrika the way she deserved to be loved, because he was born out of brokenness. He never had a damn shot. Neither did Coogie. I had no right to bring them boys into this world. And I never should've raised them in a city that would rather see their likeness painted up on a brick wall than to see them graduate from college. But you know what? I'm glad I was the vessel that was chosen to bring them into this world. I'm glad they existed in this world for the very short time that they did. Because they finally taught me what it was like to be loved with no conditions. Well. I don't have nothing left to lose. And I damn sure don't have shit to give. They were all I had, and this city took 'em from me. So. I'm always gonna be broken. And there ain't nothing that's ever gonna make me whole again. I'm so glad you got those track scholarships. Uhhuh, 'cause them student loans ain't nothing to play with. Yeah, I'm still gonna have some loans to pay back. I'm just glad you're going to college. For a while, you was acting so fast, we thought you was gonna get pregnant before you finished high school. I am not fast. We heard about that older man you was messing with. Mmhmm. You was about to get trapped in the closet. That ain't true. So how do the lesbians do the last names? What? Well, does the girly one take the butchy one's last name? Don't say "butchy." Say "masculine presenting" or "softstud." Well, I hear some gay couples combine the last names and make a whole new last name. Now, that's some Illuminati shit. Bye, y'all. How life changes and the next, you're down and aspinning and awishing it stops to get off the ground... Nigga, have you lost your damn mind? I'm just here to express my condolences. You got a lot of nerve bringing your rusty ass up to the Lord's front door. Go home. And distant... Hey, Miss Johnson. Hi. Your son and I, we were getting to know each other. He was very talented and he had a lot of potential. This breaks my heart. It really does. What's your name? Otis Perry. Hmm. My son never mentioned you to me. Yeah, well, look, I, um I just came to, uh, offer my condolences, and if you ever need anything, just give me a call. I don't need shit from you. What that slimy nigga want? I don't know. Just get me the fuck outta here. Don't know up from down... Uh, MissMiss Johnson. You can keep your thoughts and prayers too, 'cause they can't do shit for me. No, I just wanted to say... No. I just wanted to say your son meant a lot to me. He meant a lot to this city. For your voice I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Hmm. So what you gonna do? Well, I'm gonna try to keep his business alive. I think that's what he would've wanted. Shit. If I was you, I'd get the fuck outta Dodge. Chicago don't love you. This city don't love no damn body. That's him? That's that nigga. He got custody of my little brother Jake. He don't look like shit. That's 'cause he ain't. I see why Brandon used to get into it with his mom all the time. She's grieving, man. Leave her alone. She ain't have to come at me like that, though. I'm grieving too. I'm pretty sure she's grieving way more than you. Eh, fuck her. Kev. Kev, you good? Yeah. It's gonna be all right. I got you now. You're not Brandon. Nigga, you think I don't know that? Don't say "nigga." Brandon hated that word. Look, I know I can't take his place. But that ain't gonna stop me from having your back like chiroprac. We're gonna get through this. All right? Yeah. All right, come on, I think they finna play the "ChaCha Slide." I love lesbians. Yo, shut up. Ohh! Ooh! Not today, Satan. It's on now. Papa, your daddy would kill you if he saw you out here acting like a fool. He don't know what to do with that anyway. And neither do you. Shit, I ain't a kid no more. Yeah, you is. You better ask about me. Boy, bye. How long you been standing there? Long enough to see you need some help. Oh, enjoy the wedding. I got this. Are you sure? Yeah, for sure. Why you working today anyway? It's the Chi. People die every day, Ma. Emmett, you don't have to act strong for me. Can you hand me them tongs over there? Thank you. Heard you and Darnell came to the wedding together. Who told you that? It don't matter. He gave me a ride, that's it. Uh, yeah, I know that move. That's how it starts. Boy, shut up. First thing, y'all going to weddings together. The next thing y'all know, y'all butt naked on the waterbed, pshh! Please, last time I was on that damn waterbed, I got pregnant with you. Then stay away from it, then. Who you think you talking to? All I'm saying is, just call me when you need a ride, and I can go borrow Tiff's car and come scoop you. Okay. Smile, girl. Don't tell girls to smile. Stop being fast. Will y'all just let the girl live? Damn! Y'all gonna have to scooch in closer than that. Act like you like each other. Can y'all hurry up? Damn. Say "damn" again, you gonna get a whuppin' and be on punishment. I don't care. Boy, what you say? Nothing. Whoever made this mac and cheese needs their throat slit. Heh, a white person must've made this chicken, 'cause it ain't got a ounce of seasoning on it. I can't stand Dre. Why do you care? You're gonna be gone next year. I don't even think Ma like her that much. Our walls are very thin and my room's right next to theirs. They be liking each other a whole lot. They be liking each other all the time. Okay. It's time for the first dance. There it go. There it go. Ay, ay. Ay. Come on, girl. Come on, let's show 'em what we got. Hey. Whoo! I don't want, yeah. Come on. Hey. Yeah, there it is. May I? No, you may not. Come on, woman, we can dance at the wedding. No. Suit yourself. I'm sure I'll find somebody out here wants to dance with me. Yeah, I think I saw some desperate women hovering by the potato salad. Mm, mm, mm. I don't want, yeah... Ss, this some expensive shit. What you about to do with that? I'm gonna drink it. Wine ain't nothing but the blood of Jesus anyway. What's up, Eboni? Hey, Kevin. Why you wasting wine? It's for my brother. That's for Brandon. Let's get fucked up. What's wrong? Why something gotta be wrong? You don't like Dre, do you? She does get on my nerves. That's not it, though. Yo, you pregnant? No, fool. Ooh, thank God. If I was, it wouldn't be yours. Shit, you never know. If I stare at a girl too long, she get pregnant. Stop staring at me, then. No, I'm just I'm nervous about leaving next year. Really? Thought you'd be ready to get the hell outta your mama's house. I'm just not excited about leaving home, you know? Being around a bunch of white people I don't know. And I don't love track that much. I don't know, these sound like bougie problems to me. I'm serious. I wanna stay here. And do what? Fuck a bunch of wackass dudes and wind up getting pregnant by one of these motherfuckers? End up working at CVS the rest of your life? What's wrong with that? Look, who cares if you don't like track? Use that shit to get up outta here. Come on. And look, don't be afraid to leave 'cause you just too scared to see what's out there. I'm not scared. Uh, yes, you are. And that's cool. You're supposed to be scared sometimes. Are you scared? Brandon's gone. There's always a slight chance I got a kid on the way. It's my job to look after Kevin now. And I think my parents are fucking again. I'm scared as fuck. The fuck? You left me, girl. Yes, work, bitch. Jada. Come on, boy, I see you. I see. Jada, come on, come on. Uhuh, no, Dre, stop playing. Now, you knew good and goddamn well your black ass was gonna have to dance at my wedding. I don't know why you wore them shoes, girl. Come on. Hey. Oh, let me get that. But... Let me get that from you, bro. Threw my love away left it stranded... Oh. Sisters are like fine wine, and you the finest of 'em all. A woman really doesn't know what she want until she's 45. Uh, well, I'm 39. Shit, that'll work. Oh, wait. Who the hell ordered pizza? I did. Why? 'Cause the food is a struggle. I can't have people going home hungry. Well, let me whip up a fresh batch of mac and cheese and I can season more chicken. Look, I know you're going through a lot. Don't worry about it. No, no, no, I wanna earn the money you're giving me. You have earned it. Most people wouldn't even have showed up today. I applaud your dedication. Hold your head up. You'll figure it out. Here, it's half of what I owe you. I'll give you the other half tomorrow. Now, go home and get some rest. A friend of Dre is a friend of mine. You're family now. I'll always be here if you need anything. Thank you. Thank you for being there for my son. You'd never leave me... Shit. Y'all should come through. I got the house. For real? Yeah, my moms is gonna be on their honeymoon. Kiesha gonna be laid up with some dude. So I got the house. Okay, I'm down. Me too. I'll bring the weed. Really, y'all in here getting drunk without me? There's a little wine left. My bad. And y'all got the nerve to be drinking the expensive shit. Relax. Is Papa okay? You know church boys can't handle their liquor. Hey, everything all right in here? Yeah, we good. Well, come on. They're about to play my song. And this time, we're gonna get funky. Come on! Oh, to the left! Bring it back! Funky. Everybody clap your hands. Clap, clap, clap.

Like you never, never stop? Can you bring it to the top? To what do I owe the pleasure? What you talking about? You wanted to see me, and I'm here. Wait, you ain't call the meeting? Shit. Since this nigga was still breathing, I'm just gonna assume that you ain't know shit about them killing Reg. I had my suspicions, but something this sensitive, I needed to be 100% sure. How you ain't sure and I figured all of this shit out way in Kankakee? Don't look at him. He gone. I want my little brother back. When was the last time you even seen Jake? You got locked up in, what, 2013? Boy ain't seen you since he was eight. He wouldn't be able to pick your ass up out of a lineup. Excuse the pun. Nigga, Reg was supposed to take care of him. Yeah, well, Reg never made that shit official. So your mother surrendered custody to me. Of course she did. Okay. So how much is my little bro worth? A whole lot. Don't worry, she did the right thing. No, the right thing would've been to call me. Oh, I offered, but, um. Jake said you were dead. Well. I guess this is the resurrection. Boom, that's for you. For what? For being the woman of the house while we're gone. She don't get money to watch her little brother. Hey, she's 18. She's doing us a favor. A favor? We talked about this. We gotta be a united front. This ain't much. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. And this is for Emmett. I just need you to give him the money and that's all, you hear me? Ma, please, he live with his baby mama. Ain't nobody thinking 'bout him. Mmhmm. Playing when she want it is the peace sign "record it and rewind" and shout out loud... So you're not gonna ask me how my day was? How was your day, my king? Ss, don't play with me, Tiff. First of all, Brandon's mama is crazy as hell. I been knew that. She went up there raving and ranting about how she always been fucked up and that's basically why Brandon was fucked up, even though he spent his whole life trying not to be. Wow. And then when I tried to say I was sorry for her loss, sheshe was like, "You need to get the fuck outta Dodge. This city don't love you." Yeah, where's the lie in that? Here. Really? I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm good. I'm good. No, you not. How you gonna tell me how I feel? Because I know you. Did my mom tell you them niggas ordered pizza? She did. I saw people eating pizza on Nina's Insta Story. That shit's fucked up. Shit, I would've ordered pizza, too, if the food wasn't right. I'm only one person. What they expect? They expect to get some good food. Don't nobody care about what you're going through, Emmett. Shit, now I want some pizza. Are you serious? I wonder if they still open. Tiff, this not funny. This shit gotta work. I gotta do this shit for Brandon. Shit, I gotta do it for us. If you're gonna do it, do it for you. Otherwise, it ain't gonna work. "Pillow Talk" playing something the perfect place. Your pillow talk to me everything you need. Oh, shit. Your pillow... Yeah, that's it. That's it right there. Oh! Come on in. Yeah, just set it over there by the bed, man. Cool, cool. Appreciate you. Wow. Yes. Thank you. Wow, I can't believe this nigga is really running for mayor. Anything's gonna be better than what we got. Hmm. But I ain't worried I'ma try and hurry. I see you, Kiesha. Ugh, that's disgusting. Who you going to see? Don't worry about it. If Ma calls, where am I? Hangin' with Tammy. And what are we doing? Studying for the SATs. Perfect. Look, this house better not smell like weed when I get back. Yo, relax. I got, like, four bottles of Be Breezy. Boy, that shit don't work. Controls me... Hello? What's up, Eboni? It's Kev. Why am I on speakerphone? How you... how you know that? What y'all doing?

Look, I don't mind you coming here to drop my money off. Just don't come to my house looking like no hooker. Look, I don't want no parts of your situation, okay?

Uh, yeah, I think I'm going to Pepperdine. Damn, where that at? California. Ah, shit. Can I come visit? Hell no! Aw, you coldblooded. Boy, take your ass back in the house. You know I'm always gonna love you, right? Stop being messy, Emmett. Nah, nah, nah, nah. I really... For real, I don't mean it like that. I just mean like you always got a place in my heart, for real. This could work. Yeah, I'm glad we took this place. I can put my barber stuff over here by the sink. I guess I can run the card games out the back room. And if we're working out of here, the rent'll pay for itself. I already got money saved up for a lawyer. You know I don't fuck with no lawyers. Look, if we're gonna do this, we gotta do this the right way. You got lawyer money? I got you. Where would I be without you? Lost and ashy. When did you get out? Hi, I'm Imani. Thanks for agreeing to meet us here. So how much you sell your son for? Just give me the number. I'll go get him back. Five thousand. I'll give you ten. But you gotta go down to the courthouse tomorrow morning and tell 'em you're clean and you want your son back. I don't know if I can. You know, you still ain't shit. If I could erase you out my mind, I would. I knew I should've taken Jake with me. Then why didn't you? Because I ain't his fucking mama. You are. I did the best I could with y'all. Ain't none of your daddies worth shit. I ain't have no help. So yeah, if that rich motherfucker wanna take him and give him a good life, I'm gonna let him. Look, I'm not trying to get in y'all business... Then don't. Give us a minute. You know, I never knew what it felt like to feel wanted. Neither did Reg. That's why we so fucked up. I don't want that for Jake. He deserves better. Look, youyou ain't never gave me shit in this life. This is... this is all I want from you. I didn't know you wanted him that bad. Well, now you know. Fine. I'll go down to the courthouse. Thank you. All right, y'all, act natural. Hey. Maisha? Don't be startled. You tried to be slick and got caught. Ain't nobody was tryin' to be slick. Mmhmm, whatever. Me and Eboni, we go back like babies and pacifiers. Oh, uh, I didn't know that. Well, now you know. Hey, Papa. Yo, Kev, I can't lie. The summer's been good to Maisha. I'm not mad. Would it be weird if I spent some, you know, quality time with her? What you mean, quality time? Don't act like you don't know what that means. Look, how you even know she wanna spend quality time with you? You saw how she looked at me, Kev. You saw it. I saw that shit too, bro. It ain't up to me who she spend quality time with. It's up to Maisha. You right. You right. Just... treat her right. She ain't just some regular girl. She special. I know. Make your move. What should I say? Just compliment her hair and shit. Don't objectify her. She smart. You gotta connect with her on some intellectualtype shit. I can do that. There's three of us and three of them. Let's divide and conquer. All right, I'll take my room, Jake takes Kiesha's, and you take my mom's. No, fuck that. I don't know what's in there. There's probably all types of whips and chains and essential oils. They probably be using that Victoria's Secret body spray on each other and shit. Yo, shut up. I don't know what your mama's into. Papa, you don't get a choice. You get the old folks' room. My mom's not that old. Fine, I'll take this one for the team. Just go in there and burn some incense and play some Erykah Badu and see what happens. I'm tryin' to set a mood, not have a séance. No, no. Yo, I don't care what nobody say about you, Ronnie. You a'ight with me, bro. What they sayin'? Man, you know. What they sayin' about me? You know how niggas in these streets talk, man. Folks always gonna have something to say. At some point, folks need to move on, let me live my life. You took a life, man. Some people ain't gonna never let you live that shit down. It's gonna follow you around the rest of your life whether you like it or not. But you can't be worried about what people think about you. You just gotta do more good in the world, man. You just need to balance that shit out, bro. Y'all need anything else? Yeah, let me get another EandJ. Put it on my tab. Why don't you slow down with that shit, man? What, you my daddy now? Just saying, bro, you need to leave that shit alone. Yeah, that brown liquor ain't good for your body, bro. Yeah, fuck y'all. You want the drink or not? Nah, I'm good. But you know what? I'm gonna get outta here. Don't get mad, man. We're just looking out for you, Joe. I'm not mad. Appreciate y'all holding me accountable and shit. Yeah? You be careful getting home, bro. Baby oh, yeah baby just said you liked me... Bye, Big Papa. Bye, Queen. What I'm supposed to do was to get close to you. What the hell was that? A gentleman never tells. Next time, I want the lesbian room. Yeah, what y'all did? Well, I gave her a foot massage, and we talked about her plans to build a community center for kids that come from lowincome households. That does not sound sexy at all. She bared her soul to me, y'all. That's way more important than baring her body. I ain't tryin' to see nobody's soul. I want both. You gotta put in work, Kev. How much work? Well, that depends on the girl. You gotta earn her trust. You gotta bare your soul to her. This ain't all "wham, bam, thank you, ma'am" stuff. You gotta take things slow. Where are you getting this from? I been reading Devon Franklin's book. It's all about saving yourself for marriage and asking God to send you your equal. Bro, that sounds like homework. Did y'all connect with your ladies on an intellectual level? I mean... Yeah? We kissed and I fingered her. I smashed. I hope you don't regret that soul tie. What? Oh, yeah, every time you're intimate with someone, you're forever connected. You take on all their stress and all their trauma. It's attached to your soul forever. No, it's not. I hope she ain't crazy. Am I soul tied? Mm, I gotta do some research, but as soon as I get some clarity, I'll circle back. Excuse me. I'm sorry. You're good, sweetheart. Bag. You must not know who this money belong to. Waiting my body set up of you waiting so come through
