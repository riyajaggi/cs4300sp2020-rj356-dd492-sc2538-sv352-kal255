What happened? Nothing, I just... I hit my head at work. It's nothing. Hit your head? On what? Um... What is it? I tried to buy a gun. Okay, why? 'Cause I know who shot Coogie and... Why would you even try to do something like that? Because Coogie's dead, and I feel like somebody should pay for that. What the fuck are you talking about? We got plans, Brandon, and this hood bullshit is not who you are. You know that. You know, what you need to do is go to the police and tell them what you know. I'll just... I'll take care of it. Thank you for listening. Grow the fuck up. Yo, occupied. I'm handling business in here. Give me a sec. Little man, Dad will be right out. Okay, I see you don't understand what personal space is yet.

He needs a proper bed, and he needs proper day care. I know, I know, I know. We talked about it, okay? I don't know what crawled up inside you and died, but please, light a match in here when you're done. - Daddy's stinky, right? - Jesus. Lincoln Park High won the last nine out of ten Red North meets. Ain't no way we're not gonna beat them. Nine out of ten, which means they lost one - and could lose again. - Hey, y'all. Look like somebody on the struggle bus this morning. I didn't sleep well. He nervous about that play. Play, what play? My baby in a play? The Wiz, he auditioned for it. The Wiz, really? That's good. Really, Kiesha? You got a big fucking mouth. - Language! - Dollar. I ain't got no money. Well, then put your marker in. Go on. Should be $2 for talking to your sister like that. - Morning, babe. - Morning. - Coffee? - Please. So what's so important you using that kind of language - around the breakfast table? - Nothing. Kevin tried out for a play. That's good... keep you off these fucking streets. Damn. That's two. Look, the reason I didn't tell y'all about the play is 'cause I might not do it. You tried out for it, didn't you? Well, we finish what we start in this family, you hear me? No, thank you. Just give me a second. I can explain. Explain what? How you had me sitting there, waiting at the table like I used to and you never show? You don't understand... No, I do understand, which makes me an even bigger fool. It ain't like that. Then what's it like? Where were you? What's up? Please tell me. Where were you? Some shit went down, and I... And you couldn't pick up the phone and call and tell me you weren't coming? I'm sorry. Tell me something I don't know, Ronnie. I don't know what else I can say. You know what? I don't even care anymore. I don't even know why the fuck I came down here. You're on my last nerve. Don't call my job no more. Don't show up. Just leave me alone, Ronnie. I'm sick of you. Trace, come... I'm gonna figure out why this happened to Jason. I'm gonna find his phone. I promise. - Good morning. - Is it? Yeah, I'm sorry about all that shit yesterday. It's all right. I know you're gonna do the right thing. Um, my mom actually... You know, I stopped by the house yesterday, and she was saying something about her selling the house or something like that. - To who? - I don't know, you know? But I got a feeling that... whatever she about to do, she about to fuck it up. - So... - She ain't thinking straight. Exactly, which is why I was thinking maybe you could, you know, stop over there and talk to her. See if she signed anything. I ain't going over there by myself. Your mama hates me. "Hate" is a strong word. Maybe she don't like you. But she knows you're smart. Please, for me? Okay, okay, but I have a showing this afternoon, so in and out. You know what? You wanna show me a little - in and out right now? - No! Yeah, I know how it is. You know, what's up, man? Let me hit that, man. Keep that shit moving up the street, old man. You might as well just hang a sign. You want something? Trice. Am I supposed to show you mine now? Roll the fuck on up out of here, old man. It's cool, Reg. All right, it's cool. Come on. I heard you were back. Yeah, well, I guess people talk? - Bet they do. - Yeah. I see business is good. But we're blessed. Lot of shootings, kids getting killed. My shit's tight on that. Keeping order like you taught me, sir. That's not what I heard. Look, you wanna ask me something, then go ahead and ask it. I read in the paper about this kid, this star basketball player, getting shot up near that stash house. Is that house one of yours? You on a beach. What you care? All these bodies dropping... It's not good. So you came back from wherever the fuck you went so you... Look at me when I'm talking to you. You came back from wherever the fuck you went so you could give me a lecture? You're not the type for lectures. No, I ain't. So how long are you back here, man? That depends. I got some things I need to do. Well, if you need anything while you're here, you just let me know. Good, 'cause I wanna know about that kid. The basketball player. What, you know this kid or something? Don't need to. That shit's bad for business. A'ight. A'ight, let me ask around. I appreciate that. Man, why the hell are we saving this shit? I've only fried six batches of chicken, some fish, and hush puppies. That grease should last me at least another week. Wine of our people. You crazy. Shows what you know. Each batch has got some different flavors in it. So I put it in the fridge for some time, and then when I pull it out and fry some potatoes, eggs, and chicken, that flavor comes out. Talk about so good, you wanna slap somebody. Yeah, 'cause it's nasty. Nasty good. You handle your baby shit? Yeah, working on it. Um... I could really use some extra shifts. Anything open? Something opens up, you got it, young blood, but, right now, we all good. You need to get Q back his paper as soon as possible. - Yeah, I been meaning to. - Don't sleep on it. He's not a cat you fuck with, understand? Yo, man, you got a sec? Yo, Bababack up. We got back most of Jason's stuff after the autopsy, but not his cell phone. We sent the mother what we had. Well, she wants it back for the photos. Well, maybe it got lifted, you know? That block, who the fuck knows? - Hey. - Hey, don't fucking touch me. Hey, come on, man. I'm just trying to do right by my boy. Are you? And what's that supposed to mean? I showed you Jason's body out of respect, okay? This investigation's out of my hands. So I'm supposed to just move on and forget my son's dead? No, you're supposed to stop asking questions. Get the fuck out of here. Hey, Kev. Look, II don't hit girls, but if I have to, I will smack your ass. You ain't gonna hit me. You sweet. - I'm not sweet. - So you a gangster? - I guess so. - A'ight. What you doing? You gonna be with my cousin, I gotta see what you working with. Whwhat do you mean? I... That was shit. You gotta take control. What? Nno. No, what you mean? Just stand still. What you doing? - It's called a French kiss. - We ain't French. - Just one more. - I'ma be late. I gotta get to school, so... Yeah. Who you work for? My parents own a successful real estate agency in Hyde Park. I really think this place has a lot of potential. That girl bourgie as turkey bacon. Probably one of them Jack and Jill's. Both of y'all rude as hell. It's okay. I'm gonna keep this professional. So who's trying to buy your house, Mrs. Johnson? Some dude stepped to me after the funeral at church. Yeah, because he trying to take advantage of you while you still mourning and shit. You gonna talk too? Bad enough I got to listen to her. Was his name Darryl Taylor? Yeah, yeah, that's it. You know him? He have you sign anything? You signed what is called an initial offer sheet. This is not a binding contract to sell. Good. I don't know what you smiling at. I'm still selling this damn house. Shit's always breaking. Bills always due. Yeah, we're looking to downsize. I'm sorry, we? Yeah, we gonna condo it up. On the South Side? Monteagle. Tennessee... my sister got a house. You ever even been to Tennessee? No, but I been to Atlanta. Same damn thing. No, it's not. You been to either one? We're not even talking about me. Well, Greavy showed me pictures. That's all that matter. - It's nice. - Yeah, they got eagles, like... Like, bald motherfucking eagles. So y'all are looking to start fresh. - Yeah, I am. - What? You gotta think about when you retire. You gonna have more capital in the house than ever, and... Capital, what are you talking about? You should let that keep growing! - Tell her, babe. - I wanna go now! - Babe, tell her. - Okay, look. With the Obama Library being built ten minutes away and the University of Chicago building a levelone trauma center, the neighborhood is actually booming. Meaning... we could get a lot of money for this house, right? Probably more than ever before. My God. What the fuck was that? Who are you talking to? You just sprung that shit up on me. You mean the truth? You were supposed to be talking her out of selling the house, J. You asked me to talk to her about it. I did, and selling might be the best thing for her right now, even if you don't like it. If she sells, she gonna blow straight through the money, and then guess whose door she gonna be knocking at. - You don't know that. - I don't? I just watch her make bad decision after bad decision, and this house is the only thing that we got that she ain't destroyed, so what are you talking about? Selling the house isn't the problem, Brandon. What does that mean? It means that this is all tied in to whatever crazy bullshit you have with your mother. So you don't have bullshit with your family? Okay, I can't do this with you right now. Really? So now you 'bout to just drop this shit on me and roll? We can talk about this later. I have that showing I can't be late for. Wow, okay. Well, I love you too. Fuck, man. - What's up? - Shh. Cici can't pee while people talking. That's a good boy. That is a good boy. That's Daddy's little boy right there. Look at you, going pee. Look you, scrawny, you need a little scritchscritch. Whoo. Surprised you don't have one of your boys doing this. No, I'm his master, so only I feed and walk him. That way, his loyalty belongs to nobody else. You ain't here to buy shit. So what you want? You know my boy was murdered, right? Shh. I seen him play once. He was shit in the paint, but his jumper had promise. Want to know if you heard anything about how he got shot. Do I look like the Popo to you, motherfucker? No, but Jason knew better than to be up on that block. And I know better than to eat pussy when I'm in a whorehouse. That don't mean I don't do it. Shit, you know who block that is? - Yeah, Trice. - So I'm supposed to know something or find something out about shit that ain't my business and then run and tell you? Why the fuck would I do that? 'Cause he was a good kid. Didn't deserve that shit. Okay but, in return, you do something for me. You up for that? I ain't gonna suck your dick or nothing. Nigga, please. I got people for that. We got a deal? Funny that right after that other kid got dropped, you sold me that piece. So if you got any loose ends you need to tie up, better handle your business, 'cause if the police come sniffing around here, I'm gonna kill you, your grandmas, your girlfriend, and your prom date. 'Sup? My cholesterol. You buying anything? Yeah, shit. You know those boys always coming in here? Tall one, fat one, little one? Yeah, what about them? They go to school near here? Why? Think they knew my son, Jason. Wanted to see if they'd like to have any of his gear. They go to Hopkins. What time they get out? Three, but they come in here for pop and chips. Sorry about your son, Jason. Your son, the basketball player. You knew him? Yes, he'd come in, buy gum. Good kid. You finished? Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. You need something? That guy you were talking to outside the station. Yeah, he just... He lost his kid. That's Jason's dad? Kind of. Raised him, not his dad. And what'd he want? You know, he was just looking for answers. Answers, from you? Yeah, he said he didn't get his kid's cell phone back from evidence, wanted to know what he was doing on that corner. I heard you had a nonblood relative down in the morgue to ID the body. - That's him, right? - Yeah. You tell him we had that Coogie kid in custody? - No. - Good. You gonna wash your hands? Hey, remember, softball. Field three, MacArthur Park. I'll be there. Okay, well, hello! From the back you say I do, do, do! We cheer, and we dance, and we bring it to you. Man, why your sister do you like that? I don't know, but now I gotta do this dumb-ass play. Maybe she need a little big Papa in her life to, you know, straighten her out. I think she already got that. Shit. What? Man, that's the dude. That's the dude that shot the kid and chased me. - What he doing here? - What you think he doing here? He coming after us, man. We gotta go. Man, where you going? Man, where we going? We'll be safe in the auditorium. Auditorium? Get your ass in there. Come on! Mr. Williams! I see you've answered my prayers. What, excuse me? Okay, we're short a few actors, and you and your friends are perfect for it. - Come on, Kev! - Wait... Whoa, whoa, guys, guys, guys, listen, I promise you... Super important parts. The lollipop kids? Aw, hell naw. What do I look like? Like a bunch of gayass circus clowns. Man, screw this. Look, at least we safe from that dude outside. You snitch, Kev? Man, what do I look like? Don't ever ask that question again. Why he coming after us? Sus as hell, man, him showing here. Man, you in this shit too, Papa? Just saying. - Well, don't. - Yo, chill, Kev. - We all in this with you... - You're not, all right? That motherfucker coming after me. I'm the one with the real problems. Man, what I'm gonna do? The only way to get him off your back is to go to him and show him you ain't gonna snitch. Yeah, roll up on him, mantoman. Man, I can't do that. You know where he hangs, right? Yeah. So you go to him. Go to him? I can't do that. It's what you do before it becomes a thing. Show him you ain't gonna screw him over. But I ain't gonna screw him over. He don't know that. What I say? Go to him, show him you're for real and that you ain't gonna snitch on him. Hey, this your spot? Maybe. Looking for a cell phone. - Man. - I lost it. - Fuck if I'ma help you. - You sure? If you find it, there's a nice reward... I said I ain't seen, nor am I gonna see or find no cell phone. Not for no devil like you. Damn! Shit, damn! - That's my hand, man! - Shh. - Fuck! - You will for me. - Okay, yeah, okay. - Okay? - Okay. - Yeah, fuck! Shit. Goddamn. Fucker, damn. Yeah, you're on your own lifting these.

Cousin Hannibal said he'll let me use the van to get some of this stuff. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - What? - Stop. What, what you want, Brandon? Look, let me ask you something. Sit down. Stop worrying about this. What, Brandon? Why you really want to sell the house? Is it 'cause Coogie's gone? Can't even walk past the room no more. I mean, sometimes I... You know, I still feel him in there. Like he's laying down, listening to music on his headphones, and he's singing, you know? Yeah, his voice was so bad. No. He didn't care, though. Listen, baby. I know you think I loved Coogie more than you. - No, Ma... - No, no, no. I got to tell you. I didn't. You wanted to get out there, and I knew there wasn't nothing was gonna mess with you, but Coogie... he was different. He just needed me more than you. He needed us, you know. Aw, sweetie, come here. Shit! Fucking apple, motherfucker! What'd you just call him? - Nothing. - Hey. Pssh. Serves y'all right.
