 I really think this place has a lot of potential. Trice gone. So you the boss now, huh? That's the way it's looking. I'm taking the plea... save the family the pain of a trial.

 broken wrist, internal hemorrhaging... and that's just what the EMTs determined. So it looks like the perp kicked in the back door and fled out the front. Who made the call? Vic's caretaker, Jada Washington. She found her when she got to work. She rode with the vic to the hospital. She's still in surgery. Perp wasn't alone. How old was the victim? 73 years old. Get me a copy of the case report when it's done. Detective Toussaint. Violent Crimes, West Side. Hey. Detective Cruz. Homicide. Is that shotgun part of my crime scene? No, it's hers. She was a... she was a tough old bird. Is that right? - You sure? - Trust me. I'm very familiar with Miss Ethel and the family. She used to live with her grandson, Ronnie Davis. He's in County awaiting sentencing. For what? Murder. - Any thoughts on who did this? - Hard to say. You know, 63rd Street Mob runs this area. They're violent. They deal dope, guns. I heard they drop a lot of bodies. Yeah, well, they're getting dropped too. Organization's in chaos right now over a vacuum in leadership. Let me put some feelers out, you know? Maybe I can run down the field with you. Whoa-whoa-whoa. Slow your roll. Don't leap too fast, grasshopper. - Sorry? - Don't be. It's just, you're Homicide, and no one's dead. Nice Tims, though. One-oh-seven-five, WGCI-FM! Number one for Chicago's hip-hop and R&B.; Yo, Brandon, how do you work this thing again? I gotta handle the food and the money, bro? Give me that shit. Easy. All right, one burrito, one grape pop. That'll be eight-fifty, my man. Everybody talking about your joint, playa. I had to come check you out for myself. Damn. This is bomb as fuck, my dude. Yeah. Yo! Yo, where my money at? We good, bro. We good. What was that about? It's complicated. How can I help you? Mm-hmm. Okay, so you gonna bust it open for me, baby? I see. Don't be talking fly. I'll swoop over there and smash right now. - Yo, man... - Shut the fuck up, nigga. You think you running the block now, but don't forget how this shit work. You need to run Douda a bag. Forty-eight hours. Fuck! You wanna play when I get home from school? Sure, but only if you let me sleep, okay? Okay. Damn. Shit, we can beat that, Roscoe. Drive on down, pick it up ourselves. Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Where the pancakes? Uh, hold on. You snooze, you lose 'round here. Better grab some cereal. Yeah, that's him. I know, right? For real? Let me get one of these. Ah! Let me call you right back, Roscoe. These is for the kids' lunches. Help me out, man. How you got three baby mamas, but no place to stay? And why you just now reaching out and I'm less than five miles from you? You got my number too. I got it, and I pay the bill. What bill you pay? You better ask you mama about those child support payments. One more year and I'm done. You came in here the other night looking like a lost puppy, so I let it slide, but you need to know the house rules. Are you serious right now? One: Don't ask me nothing about your mama. That chapter's closed. Two: Help your brothers and sisters get ready for school in the morning. It's time they got to know you anyway. Three... We have dinner as a family, seven o'clock sharp. Break one of these rules, and you find somewhere else to crash. What the hell, Darnell? You just can't take my shit. Rule number four: It's my house. I wear what's in it. Roscoe. Yeah, it's me. Yeah, I-I know exactly where we can move it. Guard! Guard! - You need to relax, Davis. - Yo, please. - I need to make a call. - You know the rules. Rec time's the next time you can use the phone. Man, that's, like, two hours away! I need to see if my grandmother's out of surgery now! I'll see what I can do, but you need to calm the fuck down. This'll be quick. How much are these? One-seventy-five, but the better value is the family size. Why you asking Papa, anyways? These? I mean, I'm more of a Oreos man, but if you don't hurry up and pick something, - we gonna be late for school. - Yeah, man, what is you doing? I'm scouting the competition for my snack hustle. - "Snack hustle"? - Yeah. I've been watching Reg do his thing, and I said, "Why not snacks?" Buy 'em for the low-low, sell 'em to the kids at the school at a markup. I'm conflicted. On one hand, I respect the hustle, but on the other, I'm not sure I can let you exploit my guilty pleasures like this. I'm out. Is he serious? His ass just scared. Last time he had too many tardies, his dad put him on punishment for the summer. So, uh, how can I get down with this snack hustle? Naw, man, it's my thing. Yo, how much? I need you to stop handling the merchandise unless you're planning on buying it. Okay, I respect that. We good. Come on. I don't get it. Why won't you let me in on this? I'm Detective Alice Toussaint. I'm working the Ethel Davis case. Okay. Can you tell me what happened? I was coming up the block. I saw the front door wide open. That's when I first knew something was wrong. I walked inside the house... I found her on the floor bleeding. I thought... Was she upset with anyone? She have any arguments? Anything happen out of the ordinary recently? Mm-mm. I mean, I vaguely remember her complaining about some boys outside her house. But to be honest, Miss Ethel... She complains about everything. What can you tell me about these boys? Something about them gambling, making noise. Had her so worked up, she called the block captain to come out and run them off. You think it was them? Too early to tell. It used to be such a good neighborhood... probably could leave your door open, kids could play... Folks would look after your kids better than you looked after your kids. Mm-hmm. Now it's a fuckin' jungle. I'll be reaching out to you with more questions, but if you remember anything, don't hesitate to call. Okay. You gotta get me out of here. I know, your grandmother. Well, we've already withdrawn your guilty plea. I'm just waiting to hear from the judge to see if a bail hearing will be set. Okay, good. Tha-that's good. In the meantime, we need to make a case for your release. It won't be easy, but that Johnson kid was busted for shoplifting and marijuana possession two years ago. Why's that matter? Ah, well, in order to make a case for your release, we'll have to show that this kid wasn't the saint that everybody painted him as. If we can prove that he lunged at you or he tried to grab the gun or you feared for your life, then we can go with the self-defense angle. No, he was a good kid. I ain't going down that road. Look, you say you want to get out. I do, but not like this. I'm trying to help, Mr. Davis, but you have to work with me. Not bad, Greavy. Not bad at all. Four o'clock mean four o'clock. My bad. I had a lot going on. What you need me to do? Grab me a beer. I know you didn't call me all the way down here - to play bartender for you. - Nah, I needed your help hanging this fan, but as you can see, I'm done. You couldn't call me and let me know you was finished? I don't answer to you, boy. I'm fucking with you, man. Actually, I got some bad news this morning. Junie was killed. What? Junie? How? Drive-by at a house party. Caught one in the head. Damn. We went to grade school together. I mean, we went our separate ways, but he was... he was one of the guys. I got one of these on my bus. I was hoping you'd put one in your food truck for the family. No doubt. For sure. Yeah, they struggling to pay for the funeral service and need all the help they can get. Casket, food... boy didn't even own a suit. Damn. What's good, people? It's your boy Junie, reppin' 63rd to the fullest. You know what I mean? We out here opp-shopping. Wild Boys, Wild Boys, where they at, where they at? Junie tweakin'. More money. Hey, we about to go back to 63rd. If y'all wanna see how it's crackin' out there, holla at me. We 'bout to buy the block. Show 'em money. Show 'em money. What the fuck is y'all doing, sitting around crying like some ho-ass bitches? Get your feet off my motherfucking table! What the fuck is wrong with you niggas? What happened to Junie was fucked up, but we still got business to handle. Look... the second chair sent for me. We got 48 hours to come up with 100 stacks. We don't, Junie ain't gonna be the only motherfucker around here taking a dirt nap, you feel me? Junie gone. That was my nigga, and you know we gonna get some get back, but right now, y'all gotta compartmentalize that shit. Junie was about getting his paper. You wanna honor that nigga, get off y'all asses and get this bread. What type of sick fuck beats up an old lady? It's a wonder she's alive. Any word on the investigation? I'm Homicide. Why would I know anything about what's going on with Violent Crime? Look, the department's taking a lot of heat over Wallace and his bullshit. Toussaint is here on orders from Command, which means City Hall is involved, so don't get your panties in a bunch because she's in your backyard. I get it, okay? I don't have to like it. No, you don't, but if you really want to be pissed off, Here's something: I just got off the phone with the DA's office about Coogie Johnson's murder. Ronnie Davis is reneging on his plea. He's trying to get out of jail? - That's bullshit! - Agreed. Now, what about the eyewitness? That 12-year-old kid? I got his statement on record. Well, you better get him up to speed. Looks like you're gonna need him to testify. You watching your figure? Yo, how was Palestine? - Crowded. - Man, try sleeping on my father's couch. I thought you were living with your mom? Long story, but she kicked me out. Oh, she caught you fucking some chick on her bed again. Whose side are you on? So what you gonna do? I don't know. All my cash is going into storage, and Sonny's doesn't pay enough for me to get my own spot. - It's always something, huh? - Seriously. Damn. So this is why your mom kicked you out. - Watch and learn, rookie. - Okay. - This is what I do. - All right. - All right? - We'll see about that. Hey. Aren't you Emmett Washington? Yeah, that's me, baby. Yeah? - You've been served. - Ooh, shit. You know, I get that, but if it's a cookout, why I gotta wear slacks? It's a fundraiser. My parents are throwing it for Alderman Bonner. I'm not giving nothing to no crooked-ass alderman, J. Look, I just... I need to connect with Mrs. Brown about selling her condos, and then we can leave. If I make this deal, it'll be huge. All right, cool, 'cause the less time we gotta spend with your parents and their bougie-ass friends, the better. All I know is how to cook. And it's not just what I do. It's who I am. That's nice, but the success rate has to be low in that field. But when you work at a successful restaurant like Trestle, then you're guaranteed success. The cook from Fahrenheit on the Gold Coast started at Trestle. I stand corrected. Excuse me. I think I see a buddy that I haven't seen since culinary school, so... I'll be right back. When are you gonna get serious about settling down, Jerrika? We are serious. We like Brandon, but come on. Jerrika. A chef? Wow, Mom. Daddy, please, a little help? I'm sorry, J. I didn't spend 100 grand on Spelman for you to marry a cook. Maybe we should be discussing the six-figure commission I stand to gain if I land Mrs. Brown's account. Give you something to talk to your friends about. Or maybe we should discuss your plan to finally take the bar. Mrs. Brown would find you much more impressive. Mrs. Brown or you? - J. - Excuse me. Jerrika, wait. And then you just took that burnt salmon fillet and slathered it with honey glaze and called it Cajun. It worked, didn't it? I wish things were that simple now. Learning how to flambé? Way easier than running a business. Oh, yeah, they conveniently left that shit out. Case in point: I book this event, and my assistant cancels on me at the last minute. Tell me about it. I got a friend helping me on the food truck right now. This man is terrible at everything! It's an amazing property, and I'd love to pitch my proposal for why I'd be the best broker to represent you. Tell me, what can I do to earn your business? I usually only work with brokers with more experience, but out of respect for your parents, I'll give you a shot. Contact my office to set up an appointment. Thank you. Looking forward to it. Great. Enjoy. What are you doing? Chef Jeff's assistant didn't show, so I'm helping him out. Would you like a piece, or would you prefer that it came from Trestle? I only told them that so they wouldn't ask me a million questions. Mm. You ashamed of me being a chef, J? Don't even play me like that, Brandon. You know I'm not like that. I'm just trying to make this deal, and serving my parents' guests like you're one of the help? I'm just saying it looks a certain way to certain people. Mm... I don't give a shit what these bougie-ass people think. Most of them fake as fuck anyway. Look, what I'm asking might be shitty, but this means a lot to me. I just need you to play along for a little bit. Besides, don't tell me we couldn't use the money. You know what? Fine, J. How's your grandmother doing, bro? Made it out of surgery. She's in ICU. Saying it's touch-and-go. That's what's fucked up about being locked up. When shit like this happen, ain't nothing you can do. Fuck that. My lawyer's working on getting me out of here. Ain't no public defender getting your ass out of jail on a murder charge. You know how many cases they got? What do you need to do is get at Wolf's badass lawyer. Motherfucker was sentenced to life and it got knocked down to 15 years. How do I get in contact? You can't just call a high-powered lawyer from a prison pay phone. You gotta go through Wolf. Who is he? You'll see him on the yard. He ain't hard to find. I want to press charges! She had her brother jump me. All right? I want her arrested for assault right now. I have no idea what he's talking about, ma'am. She's lying. You fuckin' lying. If you want to press charges, I suggest you call the police. But today is about establishing financial support for your son, Emmett Washington, Junior. I already give her money. Two hundred dollars two months ago ain't nothing. Do you have any records or receipts of these payments or purchases? Do you have a job, Mr. Washington? Yeah, I work part-time at Sonny's Chicken Pit. And where have you lived for the past five years? With my mama. Do you have insurance, and if so, would you be the primary? No, it's my mama. What about transportation? How do you get around? The train. Or my mama. Triflin' ass. If I'm gonna get grilled about my whole life, I wanna know when I can see my son. Okay, again, that is not what we do here. Once you prove temporary financial support, you receive a court date, at which point a judge will issue a permanent order. At that point, you can address custody and visitation. So what you're saying... I gotta pay for my son... but I can't see him? I'm really sorry, Mr. Washington. Ethel, this is Bertha. Let me know if you're going to bingo tonight so I can have Otis pick you up. Hello. This is an eviction notice. Family C Realty Group would like to offer you a stipend for moving expenses. Please call us back at 800-555-0199. Hello, valued customer. Hoover's Furnit... But I already talked to them! Boy, who you think you raising your voice at? Kevin... look, I know this is a tough thing, but Ronnie Davis is trying to get out of jail. You talking to the DA could help put him away. Nah! I'm not gonna be no snitch! - Please excuse him. - I get it. He's been through a lot. Too much. We've got him seeing a therapist. - Is it helping? - I don't know. She says he's worried about dying. During a session, he said, um, "if I grow up"... like he's expecting that not to happen. Sorry. That's gotta be hard. Raising a black boy around here, sometimes... you have no idea. - You want me to talk to him? - No. I think I just need some time to figure this out. I'll get back to you. Of course. There's a wave of upwardly-mobile professionals who are more than willing to pay top dollar for a place that has great schools, low crime, and convenient transportation. But why should they buy your properties? Culture. An area ripe with art, music, and cuisine. One of my favorite weekly events nearby is the Jackson Park farmers' market. Best grilled corn you've ever had in your life. But it's not just about the events and the numbers. These investors simply want a great place to call home. You've done your homework. It's what I know. And if you're willing to reserve a small percentage of the units for low-income housing, you could receive a federal stipend to offset unpredictables and other costs. Honey, I grew up in Section 8 housing. In fact, the first building I bought was low-income 'cause I thought, like you, I could save the hood. I had to learn the hard way, you let those people in, they will ruin your property. It's not worth it. Okay. Look... I'm not sure we're on the same page. I want people with money. I'm done passing out welfare checks, if you know what I mean. Well, um... I-I personally don't recommend the low-income route, but... I wanted to give you the option. We are definitely on the same page. And once I show you my plans for staging, I'm sure you'll agree. Where do you live? - I'm sorry? - If you're gonna stage my property, I'd like to know who I'm dealing with... see how you live. Dinner at your place? Sure. Uh... how's tonight? Perfect. This all our shit, from 43rd to the hundreds. That's what's up. - What's all this? - Oh, I'm starting my own snack hustle at school. Vending machines rip people off. And I'm saving up to get a new PS4. Okay, I ain't mad. Little brother trying to be Bill Gates Junior in this fuckin' piece. What you selling them for? Uh, plain chips for 50, Doritos for 85, and the Cheetos for 70. So you gonna walk around with a change machine? Huh? Jake, check this out. Look over there. Loose change is for broke motherfuckers, and ain't none of them in this house. Do you understand? - Yeah. - Sell that shit for a dollar apiece. Keep the math simple. Hold fast, playa. Speaking of math, how your grades looking? Where the fuck is your homework? I ain't got none. Then take your ass in the back and go find some, 'cause I ain't going to jail for nobody. Boss man. We got a problem. Money's short. - That's not an option. - I know. So what's the move? Let me run the plates by you. Seven, V as in "Victor," eight, four... There was cash and jewelry left behind. Let me... let me call you back. - What were you saying? - The Ethel Davis attack. It wasn't a robbery. You say you knew the family? Yeah. Is it possible the attack was about Coogie Johnson's murder? You mean retribution? Can't rule it out. Well, I don't know. Coogie had a brother. Brandon Johnson. It doesn't feel like his style, though. What about other family members? Is there a father around or cousins? There's no father in the picture. It's just, uh, a single mother, Laverne. She certainly had some trouble with drinking and the like. Is she capable of something like this? Maybe she hired someone to do it. It's hard to say what people will or won't do when they're grieving. Good. - I'll look into the family. - Yeah. Try "excuse me" next time. Wait for me to finish my phone call. We have manners on the South Side. That crooked cop was your partner, right? Wallace, was it? If you South Siders were handling your business instead of grabbing for yourselves, I'd be on my third gin and tonic by now. Get out your feelings. I play where I'm needed. Yo, Brandon, people loved this dude. Second time I've emptied this today. Oh, yeah, well, Junie was good people. Yo, we got another big one. A dozen short-rib burritos, a dozen pork-belly tacos. Who is ordering all this shit? Man, what is y'all doing? Move! Y'all ain't even got no money. We don't need money. We eat here for free. How you figure? Reg said we good. Shit, y'all got me fucked up. Matter of fact, I'm sorry, people, we are closed. To all my paying customers, come back tomorrow and I got y'all. To the rest of y'all, pico de gallo ain't cheap. Kick fuckin' rocks. - Man! - No! No! I changed my mind. I don't like this. He's been in there almost two hours. The ADA is just double-checking the facts, Ms. Williams. No... Ms. Williams! Wait! Kevin, get up. Let's go. Get out of here. Ms. Williams, all... all he's doing is prepping Kevin for the trial. Ronnie Davis's lawyer is gonna be way more aggressive - when he's on the stand, so... - "The stand"? Like, in front of people? Ma, I told you they wanted me to snitch. Now everybody's gonna know! Ugh! I'll give you a call later. And then they got the nerve to say, "We don't even have to pay." The hell they think this is? Why don't you just move your truck to a safer area? I shouldn't have to. The South Side is my home. Come on, J, I'm not wearing that corny, tight-ass shit. I gotta cook. And I gotta land this account. Please, Brandon. You lucky you cute. - Gimme that. - Thank you. Welcome, Mrs. Brown. So happy to have you. Please, come in. This is my boyfriend, Brandon. It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you, and I hope you like braised pork belly. Oh, nice to meet you too, young man. Is that star anise I smell? I see we're dealing with a woman who knows her Asian spices. So let's have dinner. Father, bless this food we're about to receive. Bless the hands that prepared it in Jesus' name. - Amen. - Amen. So this fool called me with his "cousin" on the three-way asking me to hook her up with a job at the hospital, so I act like I hang up but stay on and listen. Yeah, here we go. - Oh, Lord. - Next thing I know, Darnell is telling Michelle I'm his cousin and how much he love her. - I lost it. - So what happened? We went up to his job at the plant and tore him a new one. Y'all got me fired is what you did. So let me get this straight. You started with her, went to her, and ended up with her? Yeah. And y'all ain't ready to kill each other? Mm, not right now. Unless someone takes that last piece of chicken without asking. Okay. We just realized we're stronger together than apart. Besides, what one person can look after all your daddy's kids? Okay? I know I ain't watching them. Honey, me either. I barely wanna watch my own. Anybody want dessert? - No, I'm full. - I'll take some of - that cobbler. - Cheryl, you did a great job with... Hey, man. Dinner's not over. Where you going? Man, don't tell me what to do. You don't disrespect my house and family like that. What the hell you think this is? I think it's bullshit that my mama got the no-good-ass nigga she got, and they get Daddy of the Year. Beer's not my thing. Just take it and hold it, man, like fathers and sons do in them commercials. Let me rap with you. Look, man... no excuses. My father wasn't there for me either, and I thought that... as long as I was providing financially, then I didn't have to put in the time. I just hope you do a better job than I did. I don't know, man. I be trying, but Tiff is crazy. Shaking me down for child support and shit. What you got going on, I can't... ever see it being like this with her. You know why they got the father of the year? 'Cause I realized I was that no-good-ass nigga, and I ain't like it. What I'm saying is your mama got the boy and they got the man. Oh, please, allow me. Oh, this one's a catch. I must say, your parents painted a different picture. He's not at all like those people we discussed. Wha-what... what people? I'll let Jerrika tell you about it. If you couldn't tell, you had the account as soon as the bánh xèo came out. Meet me Monday morning to sign the paperwork. Thank you. I won't disappoint you. We did it! You cooked your ass off, babe. It sealed the deal. "Those people"? I know what she's talking about. That's that bougie shit your parents be on. Babe, that's what's special about your food. It made a stuck-up-ass woman like Mrs. Brown open her mind. People are drawn to it. You think so? I know so. - Congratulations. - Thank you! Look at this. A nigger who done lost his way. - Don't want no trouble. - Maybe we do. Get this to Wolf. He'll know what to do with it. What the fuck is this? Currency. That's Booney. Hell, yeah, and this nigga done brought pizza. It better be Italian Fiesta! Take your motherfucking clothes off! Get naked, niggas! Now! Take your shoes off! Your socks too! Take that shit off! Get naked! Bro, put all that... just get everything in the bag, bro. Yeah, scoop all of that up, bro. Bro, you're not moving fast enough. Take that fucking shit off. Stop looking at me. Bro, stop looking at me. Look the other way! Come on, bro, hurry up. Put the shit in the bag! - Yup. - We going, we going, come on! Come on, we gone! Don't mess around with the courts, man. My cousin missed one payment, got locked up. It's not even the payments, dawg. I just don't have the money. And all I want to do is see EJ, not get locked up over this shit. You think we can get the shoe game hustle rolling again? Too slow. Everyone just waits for the new Js to drop. All right. Well, if you hear something, let me know. Let me get some Backwoods and some sunflower seeds. Bro, when y'all start selling weave? Man, that shit don't sell. And no wonder it's not selling. Look at that shitty-ass packaging. And where's the name? - The name? It's hair. - No. Women like their shit to sound exotic, all right? Like "Hawaiian Silky" or "Italian Mink" or... "French New-aveau." How do you know so much about this shit? You know how many women I know who won't leave the house without a weave? A trillion of 'em. You got a minute? I want to show you something. All right. Now, this better not be no stolen kidneys or livers. I ain't into that shit. Chill out. Ah! What the fuck is that, a dead bear? Dude, it's hair... straight from the heads of the Koyo Zom mountain people of Pakistan. I was gonna sell this shit wholesale to cut my losses. Or we clean it, bag it, and sell it... just like the Chinese and the Koreans. That's actually fucking brilliant. Can you get more of this shit? I got a direct line to the supplier in Pakistan. Ooh, we about to make a killing! Instead of slangin' Js, we slangin' weave. I'm not doing it. I'm not putting him through it. But without Kevin's help, the boy's killer could walk free. He already gave them two statements. They can't put this on Kevin. He already thinks he's gonna die. - We don't know that. - He said "if I grow up." Nina, you don't know what it's like to lose someone through gun violence. When my brother Terrell was killed, the only thing that kept my mother from losing her mind was seeing the men who shot him locked up for good. So what this Coogie boy's family gonna go through if this man gets out... and Kevin could've stopped it? Pretty smart soaking that towel with this. Where'd you get it? I made it myself. Learned how to do it in Iraq. Hmm. Oh. Yeah, I'll say it's ten times better than our shit. Well, I can show you how to make it so your people stop getting sick. I seen them in the infirmary. They all got rotgut. In exchange for what? A meeting with your lawyer. Why should I make a deal with you? The proof's in the pruno. You'll be getting favors hand over fist. I'll see what I can do. By the way, what you in for? I murdered a kid back in my neighborhood. Black? Guess black lives don't matter. Do you know who I am? I think so. You Douda, street-chair of the 63rd Street Mob. Blacque? Have a seat. I sent word to your crew to handle some business. - Did you take care of that? - Indeed. I put outside folks on it. One hundred racks in two days? That tells me that you're resourceful and industrious. Conversely, the reason why you had to get the money in the first place is because you sloppy and reckless. Douda, a lot of that shit wasn't my fault. Q and Trice was fucking up the money. I been trying to get us back... Fuckin' up the atmosphere... Is what you doing. Bunnahabhain 25. It's Scotch, nigga. Trice met with a tragic end. You saw an opportunity and you... you took it. Can't be mad at that. What about Q? He got permission from the old man to come back to reconcile some personal business. In the course, he let his emotions cloud his judgment and stole some merchandise that was in your possession that belonged to the company. Killed a cop. That's a violation. Q was held accountable. Q is gone. But let's talk about your role in all this. Trice was a lot of things, but he always brought us our paper on time. I didn't mean no disrespect, Douda. Congratulations on this blessing. You're accountable now. Ah, shit. It's all there. I remember those days. Grow your game up, young man. Tribute is due the first of every month. You see me on the streets, you don't know me. Next time you violate, it may cost you more than a fine. Oh, and, um, Reg. You eye-fuck my accountant again... and it won't be good for you. - Whoa, whoa. - Yo, what's up? Chillin', chillin'. What it do? I'm all right. What up, boy? Hey, Cruz. Check this out. There's been a pattern of break-ins... marked in blue... and home invasions in red. In more than half the cases, we got complaints of street boys making noise outside. A few days later, home invasion. Street boys all seem to be linked to the 63rd Street Mob. You're the resident authority. Any thoughts? Look... it was wrong to lump you in with the other bullshit cops. You're damn right it was wrong. You don't know shit about me. I'll put my badge up against any cop on this force, including the West Side. I stand corrected. Okay, so what about the family? It's a dead end. That leaves the gang and your expertise. Wait, is the West Side asking the South Side for help? Guess I'm slipping. Yeah, must be all that gin and tonic. Hey, Ronnie Davis's new attorney is Hendricks, AKA the Escape Artist. Looks like her plan is to call your confession into question. All your ducks better be in a row, Cruz. It's about to get ugly. Last batch, y'all! Thank you, Brandon. Going out of your way to cook for the family. You know Reg? Yes, ma'am, I do. Junie would've been so happy to have all his friends gathered in one place. I sure wish he would've kept hanging out with you when y'all was kids. Whatever I have left after the funeral, I'm gonna pay you, you hear? Thanks, but the food was Reg's idea. He already took care of it. Nobody owes anybody anything. Right, Reg? Yes, ma'am. You boys are so sweet. Yo. - Fuck... - Ey, B! Bro, this potato salad is on point. What is that, paprika, nigga? Naw, dawg, Old Bay. Mmm. But naw, real talk... that was cool, what you did for Junie. I've known the dude since we were shorties, and... his mama ain't never looked at me like that. Good. I'll take it as gratitude. 'Cause our debt is settled. I'm done with the bullshit. Come on, bro. - Come on, bro. - Oh! Yeah. Go. Boom! - That's your ass. - Man, whatever. You're just lucky. So, uh, where everybody at? Your house never this empty. The whole crew is at Junie's repast. I'm in charge of making sure nobody hits up the house. Yeah, you probably wanna stay away from the windows. Uh... So now that Junie's gone, what happens next? We smoke one of them, they smoke one of us. It's all stupid. Y'all know who killed him? Yeah, but ain't nobody snitching. - That's what's up. - Naw, man. I used to think that, but... people be snitching all the time. This gang shit? It's all fucked up, Kev. You're lucky you don't have to deal with it. But I gotta deal with shit too. Like not one but two moms always telling me what to do. You still got it good. I wouldn't even know my mom if she knocked on that door. So, uh... how can I get in on this snack hustle, though? I wanna get paid too. Naw, man. I hustle 'cause I have to. You shouldn't. Like I said, this ain't for you. Can you get me out? Wolf said you were the best. What day of the week did you enter County? I think it was, um... a Tuesday, maybe? Do you remember the time? I reviewed the confession video. You appear to be impaired. Are you a drunk, Mr. Davis? Most people in County can recall months later the exact date and time they were booked unless something is impairing their memory. I'll review your medical reports. I'm sure they'll indicate a positive alcohol test. I also learned that the deceased has an arrest record. Well, I-I told the other lawyer that I don't wanna go down that road. Black men are being arrested every day just for asking to go to the bathroom; you are asking a judge to let one out who has confessed to murder. You wanna see your grandmother again, I'd be less precious about my tactics and your character. Last thing. Did you kill Charles Johnson, Mr. Davis? Yes. Good. How's that good? 'Cause if I know you're being honest with me, I can be honest with you. You a drunk, like I thought. So stop drinking that fucking pruno so I can get you out of here. You smell like shit. A two-bedroom would've been nicer, but I guess it's a'ight. I'm staying at Darnell's for now, just in case you cared to know I'm not sleeping on trains anymore. Look at that. You don't have your mother as a safety net. You're still alive. How's it been over at your daddy's? How many brothers and sisters you got now? Five? Six? Twenty? That's so shady, Ma. You okay? Oh, damn, I forgot to tell you. Somebody broke into Miss Ethel's house and attacked her. She's in pretty bad shape. Oh, damn. I thought I had a bad day dealing with Tiff. What happened with Tiff? You got any wine up in here? Hey, Kev. What's up? Hey. You okay? Yeah. I was thinking... and, uh... I just wanted to let you know that... I'ma do it. I'll testify.
