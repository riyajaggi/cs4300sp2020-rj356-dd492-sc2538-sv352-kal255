 Yeah, that's about right. Yep. Thanks, mate! Are you alright there? (Muffled) Fine. Sorry? I'm fine. Where's my tea? I didn't know you wanted one. Would you like me to put the kettle on? No, no. I'm fine. Oh. OK, just hold it there, thanks, mate. Hold up. Thank you. Slow.

 Thanks, mate. Righto, come through. Jesus, stop the car! Arggh! Sir, are you alright? Are you hurt?! Alright, I'm gonna try and open the door, alright? MAN: Oh, he smells like a brewery. I was going to bring you that cuppa. Looked like hard work out there. It is. Don't we have a vacuum cleaner for that sort of thing? It's not working. Well, you know there's an appliance fair at the co-op this week. Oh! You'll enjoy that. (Telephone rings) I'll get it. Dr Blake's surgery. One moment, please.

 It's for you. Oh, Danny. How's your morning? Terrible! Almost got killed. How about you? Yes, me too. What's the story? Straightforward drunk driver. I'll just leave it to Gus. Right, so, everyone's safe. Who was it? Travelling salesman. He died at the scene on the Creswick Road. And how do we know he's a salesman? Oh, backseat of the car was full of gear. Head back to the crash site, look through his car. Make sure you get the man's personals. Can I take a car? That bloke wrecked my pushie. Walk. Be good for you - and you can go home. There's nothing here for you. Good. Right. Well, feel free to waste my time whenever it suits. Uh, Doc? Doc, Doc? Yes? What would make a bloke's face turn blue? Gus! I was curious too. What do you make of the colour? Professional curiosity, or are you just here to annoy me? As always, Gus, I'm here to help. (Horn honks) Hey! (Laughs) You should have seen your face. Do you mind?! You actually left the ground! Yeah, very bloody funny, alright?! Oh, there's no need to be like that. I was nearly killed earlier today, so it's not a joke, alright? Well, maybe you need to toughen up a little bit there. Don't suppose I could grab a lift. Come on, it's halfway out of town! Well, maybe that'll teach you not to bite my head off next time. The walk'll do you good, get that blood pumping. Ray Beck, travelling salesman. Looks like a film star. Women must've been all over him. Do I detect a hint of envy there, Gus? Done the bloods? Not yet. Obviously another drink driver. Really? You didn't smell his clothes? No, but I smelled his mouth. No trace. You'd expect something there, wouldn't you? Colour suggests asphyxiation, wouldn't you think? Haemorrhagic stroke? Hmm, might be right. Cracked sternum. Minimal bruising. I think he was dead before he crashed the car. Can I see his clothes? (Insects buzz) Arggh! Help yourself - his clothes. They're too sharp for my taste. Oh, I find that hard to believe, Gus. Phew, I see what you mean about the alcohol. His trousers are covered in it. Actually, only one leg. Gus. What do you make of these? Acute infection or some kind of poisoning. Snake bite. Arggh! Arggh! Arggh! Lawson. I told you to go home. Is Danny still at the crash? Yep. You told him to search that car, didn't you? Yeah, why? He might be in trouble. Some help here! Mattie? Get some help here! Take his shoulders. Right, oxygen, now! WOMAN: I've got the treatment room prepped! What kind of snake? I don't know. We can't give him anti-venom if we don't know what kind of snake it was. I don't know! Right, on my 'three'. One, two, three. Pulse. Onto it. 110. Blake. The men are looking for the snake. They still haven't found it. What do we do now? (Sighs) Haemotoxic, cytoxic, neurotoxic. Haemotoxic, cytoxic... Haemotoxic? But from what you said, there was obvious neural dysfunction. What are you talking about? We can't give him anti-venom if we don't know what kind of snake it was. Can we give him something else? We have three generalised vaccines. Well, use one of those. We don't know what the poison is... Pulse again, please, please, please. 120. He's in shock. Danny! Snake bite. What kind of snake? We don't know. Well, what are you gonna do? Blake. Lucien! Blake? What kind of snake? I don't know. Well, we can't give him anti-venom if we don't know what kind of snake it was. Lucien? Pit viper. Asian pit viper. Asian?! Native to Asia. Not an Australian snake. Two deep puncture marks from hollow fangs. Very, very distinctive. No Australian snake has fangs quite like it. You've treated a viper snake bite before. No, but I've read about it. Are you sure about this? Not 100%, no. But as sure as you possibly can be? Please clear the room. Jean? I'll wait in the corridor. Alright, Mattie, haemotoxic. Good. 120 over 80. He's going to be alright. Oh, thank God! Perhaps he should stay with us until he's feeling better. Of course! Absolutely. Well done. An Asian pit viper. Hmm. An educated guess. How did a deadly foreign snake get into that salesman's car? Well, snakes crawl into cars all the time. Not Asian pit vipers, not here. Well, some idiot bought it into the country, let it escape. Good job, Lucien. Thank you, Matthew. Right, see you again next week. Claire Connolly! How are you? I can't find anything specifically wrong with you, Mrs Connolly, however, in general you are certainly run-down. Your heart rate is normal, your blood pressure's a little high. Have you been under much stress lately? My husband and I, we run a boarding house. There's been some drama lately. One of the guests died in a car crash. Ray Beck. You know him? Not really, no. I gather he sold vacuum cleaners. Apparently he was the best. You know, my housekeeper is in need of a new vacuum cleaner. Oh. The house is full of salesmen. You could name your price. Latest model - the Constellation, for your delight. It is, as they say, pure heaven. Heaven? Mm-hm. For the lady, therefore, for the gentleman. What about the Canterbury? Hubby's on a budget, is he? Erm, I'm just the housekeeper. My apologies. Like I said, free delivery, free bags, one year's free servicing. There's a sucker born every day. This is my sale. Jim Thurlston. District's top salesman, all domestic appliances. Second top seller. Haven't you noticed? Ray's no longer with us. Ray Beck, the chap who died? That's right. Bloke had the most amazing contacts, especially in refrigeration. Look, I just couldn't compete. He's gone. I'm top dog now. Gentlemen, surely a little healthy competition isn't a bad thing. Fine by me. That's because mulleton here is never gonna match me. Well, I'm off to find a cup of tea. Hubby might leave you with it. Hand on heart, all the ladies swear by the Constellation. You want a real deal? Talk to the real salesman. Mrs Connolly? Mrs Connolly? Hello? Don't you yell at me, Frank Connolly! MAN: Come here, woman! I will bloody yell at you if I want to. I have had it up to here... You've had it? Yes, I bloody have! I hate you so much! Don't you walk away from me! Don't you give me orders. Come here, woman! (Vacuum cleaner drones) JIM: See that? Perfect suction every time. Exactly the same model I was offering. But with free bags. I said free bags. Year's warranty. I can do that too. (Vacuum cleaner silences) Two sets of bags, year's warranty, cost price. How do I know it's the model I really want? You can borrow mine, try it out and see if you like it. Oh, thank you. And if you like it, do we have a deal? (Vacuum cleaner drones) There you are. The A... the Asian pit viper hates the cold, so that snake... You know, the snake, there's no way it would survive out here in the bush. What?! The... (Vacuum cleaner silences) Never mind. How is it? Well, it's fine, but it's not picking up as well as it was before. I think we need to empty the bag. I'm sure that's probably relatively easy to sort out. Well, maybe you could do it for me. (Sighs) Yes, of course. I'm sure it's just a matter of unfastening something on the side or the back or... There we are. Oh, yeah! 'Relatively easy'? Well, if it would just do as it's told. Oh! (Both exclaim and cough) Don't worry, I'll fix all that up. (Coughs) Hang on. (Footsteps thud) (Doorknob rattles) Constable, we'll need access into here. Go and get the key from Frank Connolly. Sorry to disturb you at a time like this. Was the missus happy with the vacuum she borrowed? Yeah, the missus was ecstatic, thank you. Then I'll drop the machine over tomorrow. Tell me, was Mr Churchill disappointed he missed out on the sale? It's dog eat dog in our line of work, Doc. Yeah. What's with all the coppers? Oh, I couldn't possibly comment, Mr Thurlston. If you'll excuse me. (Whistles Danny Boy) Is there a law against keeping a few snakes or something? Mmm, there is. You broke it. I understand a Mr Raymond Beck was staying here, Mr Connolly. Yeah, he was. You know that he died? Car crash, I heard. Hate to think that booze was behind it. He could always put it away. Well, there's more than the car crash. He died from snake bite, and then a young constable of mine got bitten while he was searching his car down near Kilburn. The thing's still on the loose. Now, you've got an empty cage downstairs that's supposed to have an Asian pit viper inside. Yeah, I didn't know it was missing till that bloke broke in. Where's the snake now? No idea! What do you mean, you've got no idea? It's supposed to be in the bloody cage. But I honestly don't know. Look, I told you. I always keep the key to the basement on me. I used to have a spare key, but... Missing too, is it? I've got a dead man who stayed here and a young constable in hospital, both bitten by a snake, and you know nothing about it. I need you to come down the station and make a statement. My men are going to search Mr Beck's car, and if they find a snake and it's an Asian pit viper, I'm charging you with murder. (Mrs Connolly sobs) MRS CONNOLLY: This is where Ray Beck was staying. It's alright, Mrs Connolly. I'm sure this situation isn't helping those issues we discussed in my surgery. If you feel the need to come back and see me again, please do. I do have to ask you a question, I'm afraid. Your husband mentioned the spare key to the basement went missing. Now, is this right? Frank looked after the keys. The basement wasn't any of my business. Of course. Just one more thing, if I may. Ray Beck was a very handsome man. Did your husband have any reason, any reason, to be jealous? She was having an affair? She's unhappy. She has an affair with the handsome salesman in the upstairs room, then hubby finds out and sticks his deadliest snake in her lover's car. Well, how do you know she was unhappy? I heard them arguing. I was hiding in their kitchen at the time. You should've seen her expression when you mentioned Ray Beck. She was almost in tears! The way she folded his clothes. By the way, did you find his sales notebook? Apparently Ray was the region's top seller, but his notebook wasn't in his jacket at the hospital. Haven't found it. Why? Their notebooks contain their contacts, and they treat these books like the holy grail. Word is that Ray's contacts were the best. No, haven't found it, but there was something else. The man liked to punt. All these are marked 'unpaid'. Goodness! £200, that's a lot to owe. If it's the bookie I'm thinking of, he wouldn't have been happy that Beck couldn't pay. Eddie Carlin, real lowlife. Has a particular way of writing his numbers. (Telephone rings) Saw young Parks today. Looks like he's on the mend. Close thing, but yes. Lawson. Yep. It's Hobart. They've found the snake. Well? Yeah. That's a pit viper. Frank Connolly, I'm arresting you on the charges of murder, attempted murder, possession of dangerous animals as defined in the relevant Acts. You don't have to say anything at this time, but anything you say or do may be given in evidence. Do you understand? Take him down. Mrs Connolly. Are they charging Frank? Yes, they are. Can you... can you tell me what happened? (Sobs) There's no way he would have ever hurt Ray. Well, that's not how it looks, Mrs Connolly. Now, I know you and your husband weren't exactly happy. But Frank wouldn't hurt anyone. Wives often say that, Mrs Connolly. But I know Frank! Then please tell me what happened with Ray. Oh! Mrs Connolly! (Footsteps thud) No admissions yet, but that'll come. What about that bookie you were talking about? Carlin? Lowlife scum. Have to get him on something else. (Racing commentator gabbles on TV) Mr Carlin will see you now. Yep, righto, Harry. Yep, right, OK, gotcha. See ya. Ray Beck said you'd give good odds at today's meet at Flemington. Ray Beck ain't worth a toss. Don't bring idiots like this in here again. Come on. Wait! Listen, I need to place a few bets, and I'm guessing Ray owing you money's left a bit of a hole. What do you know about Beck? That he died. (Laughs) Real shame. Must've been somewhat annoying, Ray dying and owing you money. (Telephone rings) You talk too much. Hello? Ah, yeah. Spring flutter? OK, mate. Yep, see ya. Look, I'd like to take a piece of that action, if I may. Spring Flutter for a win in the fourth. 20:1. 5, and Landed Gentry for a place in the sixth, £5. 16:1. Good. I guess it's not really in your interests to kill someone if they owe you money. Sterling Silver in the ninth. Winner or place, £5. You kill them, you don't get your money back, do you? Well, if depends. I need to set an example. And how would you do that, exactly? (Laughs) Would you ever use a snake to make an example of someone? Who is this guy, boss? I've no idea, Maurice. But he's lucky, he's lucky you got a sense of humour. Yeah. You've probably got less than five seconds to tell me exactly what you want. Right, well, when you put it that way, I... Please, just... I just need to find out more about Ray Beck. Nothing about you. Oh, why didn't you say so? Rubbish punter! He owed me 200 quid. He's lucky I didn't get to him first. Pretty boy. Apparently the bloke couldn't keep it in his pants. MAN, ON TELEVISION: It's almost a dead heat between Acapella and Sterling Silver. It'll be remembered for the fourth that lasted longer than the race. Mr Carlin said there wasn't much return for you today. Oh, I don't know. I think I got what I needed. Oh, and he said to say you're welcome back at any time. Well, thank you, Maurice. You tell Mr Carlin I'm honoured. Hi! How are you feeling? Yeah, pretty weak still. I'm not surprised. I brought you something. Thanks. It was the least I can do. You feel up for this? Yeah. What sort? You choose. Oh. (Laughs) What? I'm sorry. What? You should see your face. Oh, I can't believe you were gonna feed that to me! That's hilarious! Ma... Mattie! Oh! Bloody... Jean? I see your new vacuum's arrived. Oh, has it? Yes. I thought you might've unpacked it by now. Now, I've had other things to do. Right. Here's hoping it makes something of a difference, eh? Tell me, what do you know about the Connollys? The Connollys - married young. The house has been in the family for years. Frank and Claire have had to rent rooms out. Hard times? Hard times. Pass the whetstone? Yes. Frank was a champion full forward till he did his knee. She's nice. Seems unhappy. I wouldn't have thought he's the kind of man who would kill anyone, though. Well, did you think he was the kind of man who'd keep snakes in his basement? Oh, I stand corrected! Any reason for the unhappiness? Should there be? Well, yes, I'd have thought so. Oh, why don't you ask her yourself? Huh. I have absolutely no idea. Really? No idea at all? No. I missed something? No, I'm sure you're right. It's probably just that time of the month or the stars have aligned... Mattie. I'm sure Jean loves being taken for granted just as much as the rest of us, and God help us all if any of us started complaining. The whole bloody world would end. (Telephone rings) Yes?! Dr Lucien Blake. I wouldn't have called you. The bloke doesn't seem to be in any danger. It's just... strange. Has he been this way the whole time? Usually used to the blokes who want to take me on. Mr Connolly! You need me to stay? No, I'll be fine. Mr Connolly, it's Dr Blake. Is there anything I can do for you? I want to die. Mr Connolly, whatever you say to me I will hold in the strictest confidence. Claire never deserved this. Deserved what? Mr Connolly, please. Leave me alone. Morning. Are you alright to walk? Jean... How are you? Fine. You're gonna be a bit slow for a while. I'm fine! You're coming to stay with us for a few days. I'll set up the spare room. Is Mattie gonna be there? Yeah. Right. (Cheerful music plays on radio) Well, come on through. We'll get you settled and I'll pop the kettle on. Hey. (Music silences) Oh, I was rather enjoying that. G'day. I'll put you here, Danny, till I've set up the spare room. Yes. I'll leave you to it. You're not staying for lunch, Mattie? Uh, no, I'm going out. I might get you to drop me at work, if that's alright. Boss doesn't like being a man down, and the boys have been covering for me... No, no, no, no, Danny. You're just out of hospital. Doc, I'm good, and I don't wanna be hanging around, you know? Danny, I really would... I'm fine, really! I'll be on my way. Thank you, Mrs Thompson. You take care now. New hobby. Hmm. What do you think of him? Too smooth for my taste. What about him? Well, he's fine if you're a 16-year-old girl, but the rest of us have more important things to worry about. What would you think if I started cutting these chaps out of our magazines? Yes. Just returning your vacuum cleaner. Oh! Mrs Beazley says thank you. I'm afraid we had a blockage. Your husband... He's innocent! They should let him go. Claire, how long have you known? When did you first realise Frank was homosexual? He'd beat you to a pulp if you'd said that to his face! Yes, he probably would, but I think it's also the reason he's currently catatonic on the floor of a cell back at the police station. Is he alright? He's not doing well. He's in deep trauma. Can I see him? Not till he goes to remand. Now, your husband and Ray were lovers, weren't they? Claire, it's not your fault. It's not his fault. In fact, it's not even a question of fault. Modern research... What does modern research know about my marriage?! Probably not much, but it suggests, it suggests, that this has been a part of Frank right from the very beginning, right from the start, just like hair colour or eye colour. This has nothing to do with you. I didn't understand at first. I just thought it was me. I started to wonder. Then I found him with someone. He said he'd change, but he couldn't. So, Ray wasn't your husband's first lover? No, there were others. Sometimes the men who passed through here. He only met Ray a few months ago. I had never seen him like this before. He was... Happy. Claire, do you think your husband could have killed Ray? He couldn't have. He loved him. So, what's this about? Connolly and Beck were lovers. Trying to eat my lunch! I'm sorry to offend your sensibilities. You realise that if this is true, I'll have to charge Connolly with unnatural acts on top of everything else. Well, you could, but I hope you don't. Where did this piece of information come from? Well, I completely missed it, but Ray had the only single room in the place - a place where everyone else has to share. Doesn't mean he's a... No, no, no, but Frank Connolly was the one who assigned the rooms. His wife confirmed it. Always thought she was a reasonable-looking woman, myself. Yes, and Eddie Carlin told me Ray couldn't keep it in his trousers. Eddie Carlin? Mmm. Of course, we all assumed he was talking about the ladies, and I thought Claire and Connolly were fighting over Ray, and of course, they were, only not quite as I imagined. Maybe they were just a couple of blokes having a little tiff. Well, Claire doesn't think so. It sounded like they were soul mates. Oh! So, I may have encouraged you to arrest the wrong man. Still, means we can rule out Eddie Carlin. (Sighs) Jesus, Blake. You don't think Mrs Connolly... Took revenge on her husband's lover? Possibly, but I doubt it. Parks, get me the Connolly file. I really don't think it was her, and I'm not convinced Danny should be back at work. Well, it was only a little snake. Jean? I'm a little bit stuck. I'd love a chat, but if you're busy... Oh, I think I can manage. Is this about the Connollys? Yes. Turns out she's not having an affair. He was, with one of his boarders. The chap who died. Oh! Would you have guessed? No! He was always attentive. Just like any married couple, eh? Well, there's more than one kind of marriage. I was only married a very short time, so I'm afraid I'm no expert. Thing is, the basement was locked, there was only one key. Are you sure about that? Well, there was another key, but it was missing? So, who else could get into that basement? Did Frank any other lovers? Claire said quite a few, but once Ray showed up on the scene, that was that. So, why else would you want to put a snake in his car? You know, they're a competitive bunch, theses salesmen, and apparently Ray was the best, and it would appear someone has stolen his book of contacts. So, how would you like to go about this, Dr Blake? (Telephone dial whirrs) Danny? Yes. Listen, I might need your help with something. Ah, Jean, allow me. Now, are you ready? I think so. Danny, give us five minutes and then come up, yes? OK. I sold you that machine. We had a deal. Well, I think we can do better. You can't do better. I'm the region's top seller. Since Ray died. Care to give it a go, Mr Churchill? He already tried and he couldn't do it. Keen to have another go, Doctor. And just to add a little bit of a sweetener, Mattie here could use a small refrigerator. This is my sale. I'm sick to death of you scrimping on spending and then splashing out on whatever SHE wants! Oh, yes, that's right - pretend to be innocent. Ladies, ladies, I think we can find something that keeps you both happy. Same great machine, same price, two free bags and a year's warranty. I'll match it. And you've already got the machine. I've got one in my car. How do you like ice-cold juice, sweetheart? I've got all the latest fridges for you, cost price. And that's better than you'll ever be able to do. It's killing me, but for someone as pretty as yourself, 20% off cost, free delivery, and the Constellation as we agreed, and I've got the Constellation in my car, if we're done. I'll get my contact book. But that's... wrong. How can you get 20% off cost? Only Ray could go that low. Yes, that's interesting, Mr Churchill. The other day you couldn't beat Jim here on the price of a vacuum. Today you can, and also today you can offer tremendous discounts on fridges. I thought that was solely Ray's territory, and I'm guessing that's probably Ray's contact book, the one you stole after you murdered him. This is my contact... Mrs Connolly, do you have the key the young constable returned to you? Yes. Thank you. Identical. The missing spare key to the basement on your key ring, Mr Churchill. This is my con... Hey, stop! Stop there! Stop! Jean, see to Danny, please! I'm fine! Danny, are you alright? We need to get you back to the hospital. Anything for a sale, Mr Churchill. Told you not to go back to work. I was feeling better. You weren't ready. Two days bed rest, minimum. You're coming home with us and taking it easy. Oh, no, I might... go home. Danny! No, it'll be fine. Afternoon. Excuse me. All good, just not quite ready to exert himself. Would you be interested in sitting in on the interview? Churchill? Of course. Listen, you say g'day. I'll just be a moment. Mattie. You should go in and see him. I'm sure he's just fine without me. LAWSON: So, you and Frank Connolly were lovers, then Ray came on the scene. Frank didn't want to know me after that. What about the snakes? I knew where Frank kept the spare key. So you took it and then you stole the snake. Mmm. Do you think it's easy being like this? Do you think I want to? Mr Churchill... I never asked for this. You despise me, don't you? I... I disgust you, don't I? Mr Churchill, I spent some time in a prisoner of war camp, and there was a young man there, he was executed just before we were liberated. He tried to steal medical supplies to save his mates. I had to read some of his letters to get word back home, and it was only then that I realised the girlfriend he spoke of... ..wasn't a girl at all. And he was the bravest man I ever met. I loved Frank. But he loved someone else. (Knocking at door) Yes? Is it safe to come in? Perhaps. I just wanted to say thank you. I still don't know how you could afford to buy us a brand-new vacuum cleaner and a refrigerator. Well, believe it or not, I had a little win on the horses. Oh! Erm, happy birthday for tomorrow. I hadn't forgotten. Lucien! Well, go on, open it. Oh, thank you! It's beautiful. Was it hers? No. No, I, um... I bought it before the Japanese invaded, and I thought it might make a good present one day, and indeed it has. Happy birthday, Jean. Drop the gun! (Gunfire) JEAN: This is about Sean McBride, who murdered a policeman. Apparently. The bloke wanted to die. And you saw McBride kill that man? I was there. McBride confessed. He killed Cooper and took a shot at Parks and Hobart. (Men speak foreign language) There was a second wound caused by a blow to the back of the head inflicted before he was shot. What would you say if I told you I'd discovered certain links between Sean McBride and the police. Do you know who he passed information on to? The entire case against Sean McBride was circum-bloody-stantial! He confessed! It was a lie! Admissions? No! Did McBride recant? No Then you've got nothing! They want someone to hang!
