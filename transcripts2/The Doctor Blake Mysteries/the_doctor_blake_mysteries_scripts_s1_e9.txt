 Admit it, doc, you've got no hope. 28 to win, you've got two throws left. I don't want to put you off but I can't see it happening, eh? They call my Dr Dart, Danny. Ah, that would be 12. Double eight to win. Loser buys the last round. OK, I'll buy the drinks if you win because you've got no chance. Dr Blake! Thanks for that, Joe. I just wondered if you'd had any more thoughts about tomorrow night?

 No. Ten to six, gentlemen! Last drinks! You and the Consul both saw action on Malay Peninsula during the war. The board actually thought you'd like to introduce him. Please don't take this the wrong way, Joe. I'd rather have typhoid. Right that bell, you a shout at the bar. Righto. Drinks are on me. Hang on, hang on. Money upfront. Five quids should cover it. How about this instead? Where'd you get this from? Dug it out of the ground, where else? Hmh! Drinks are on Arthur! Hey, hey, hey, you still owe me a drink.

 Didn't you hear that? Drinks are on Arthur. Hello? Is anybody there? Show yourself, you coward! Ah! ♪ Theme music What were you doing down here this morning, Mr Vernick? Shooting. Oh, is this your property? Nope. You usually go out shooting on other people's properties, do ya? Nope. Danny. Doc. Need a hand? I'm sure I can manage, Bill, thank you. That you, Blake? Well, you took your time. Try not to slip. You might want to watch your step there. No wallet, no ID. His name's Arthur. Surname? I don't know. Came in at the pub last night telling everyone he'd struck gold. Well, that was smart. You right, there? Yes, I'm fine. You don't look it. He's changed his clothes. Got rid of the beard. Aftershave. Island Bay rum. I reckon it's dodgy. You mind if we talk about this somewhere else? Broken ladder rung. It was thrown on top of him. Someone threw him down here first and broke the ladder to make it look like an accident. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to get out of here. He was murdered. What's he doing now? Lawson! Tyre track. Made after Arthur's car arrived. By a motorcycle stopping about here. Margaret. Doctor. My appointment, I'm so sorry. It's been a terrible morning. Margaret, who's that? It's Dr Blake! Please don't say anything about my tests in front of Eric. Of course. Come in. Thank you. Well, your tests were fine. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to conceive a child. If there is a physiological problem... ..it's not yours. Now, I appreciate you've had something of a shock this morning... What do you mean, doctor? The police? I'm sorry, I thought... Margaret, what the devil are the police doing here? Doctor. Eric. Well? I don't know. Good morning. I understand a man named Arthur rents the bungalow at the back. Yes? Name's Arthur Pike. Why? Uh, Mr Pike died in his gold mine overnight. We don't know the cause of death at this time but we're treating it as suspicious. Just wondering if Constable Parks and I could come in and take a look at his living quarters. Certainly. Did you see him last night, Mr Reid? I was in the club all night. Haven't seen the fellow for weeks. OK, could you open the door and step aside for me, please? What the hell do you think you're doing? Two hours to tell these people, what took you so long? He's just their boarder and you're pre-empting the investigation. And why would I do that? I don't know. Because you're a pain in the arse? Leave. Now. I mean it. Go. Oh, it's gorgeous, isn't it? Are they sapphires? And a pearl in the middle. One of these days you'll be wearing a ring like this. I can't wait. Any patients? Two. You'd know that yourself if you'd come through the front door. Dr Blake, this is Eadie. Ah, the bride to be. Congratulations. Thank you. Eadie, you still looking for something borrowed? I thought you might like to wear this. Oh, it's lovely. You sure? No, never gets worn anymore. Your parents must be very excited. Oh, my mum is on the warpath. Oh, why? She doesn't want me to quit work after the wedding. Ah. We had such a fight. Can't blame her. Mattie! You don't want to stop working entirely, do you? Yes, I do. Some women are more than happy to just be wives and mothers, Mattie. Exactly. How was your dead body? Pretty quiet. Gold prospector, Arthur Pike. ..isn't it? So, are you going to stop nagging me about quitting my job? Or can we try on that dress? You going to the reception tonight? For the new British consul? No. Well, you'll be missing out. It'll be a lovely occasion. So I'm told. You know he was in Singapore? Like you were. You might find you have something in common. I doubt that. Oh... Now, tell me about these dizzy spells of yours. I get them every morning when I get out of bed. Lucien... Your hands. You know I always get nervous in your company. You're avoiding the question. This town would do well to see a whole lot more of you, Lucien. It's beautiful. Do you think? Mm-hm, yes. You'll be brilliant, I just know it. You alright? Yes. Right as rain. Knock, knock. Ah. Everybody. Baby. Wow, um, well, we should go. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye-bye! Bye! She could do so much better than him. Come on. Can I take this off now? Mm-hm. I have an idea. Let's save some time, then. Two cranial blunt force trauma injuries. The first, inflicted by something cylindrical. Pot? Exactly. But I think the second one killed him. Probably hit his head on the side of the mine shaft when he fell down. Great. Goodness, you sound surprised. Now, these burn marks. Gus, what do you make of them? Um, they're recent, second degree, distending to the reticular dermis. Looks like he was tortured. Oh, come on. What self-respecting torturer would focus all his attention on the forearms and leave the genitals untouched? Do you know a self-respecting torturer? Once upon a time I knew a whole squad of them. Now, look, there's some atrophy in this left leg. It looks like he's had some kind of surgery on that left ankle. Wouldn't you say? Why don't you just take my job? I could spend more time with patients who have a pulse. Oh, Gus. You have no idea how much I enjoy our little chats. Cranial blunt force, died after being thrown down the mine shaft. Why are you here? Parks! Sir? Get a witness statement from the doctor. Witness statement? That way. We're interviewing everyone who was in the pub last night. Ah. And who's going to be taking your statement, Danny? I am. Be careful you don't incriminate yourself. Who do you remember there? You, and I want a rematch. What time did you leave last night? 6.10. You find anything in Arthur's flat? No gold. Stolen? Someone broke into his flat after he died. Now, after you left the pub... Anything else? Um, in his room? Driver's licence. Had to tear the place apart to find it. Was in a book under his bed. In a book? Ah. And where do you keep your licence, Danny? In my wallet. Hmm. May I see it? This licence? Doc. Come on, Danny. Well done. Anything else with his name on it? No. Car registration? Yeah, the car was bought with cash. The rego wasn't transferred. Can you hurry up, please? What about Margaret Reid? Margaret Reid, did she tell you anything else about her board? He was a gold prospector, that's all she knew. Well, I'll tell you something. His hands were as soft as a baby's bum. Arthur Pike never lifted a shovel in his life. Oi! What are you doing here? Haven't made up my mind. What's down there? Nothing. Let's say I wanted to find out. You shoot many rabbits with that? All kinds of vermin. Well, happy hunting. There'll be dancing tonight, you know? Oh. Is it lunchtime already? No. No, I just thought you might be practicing for the reception. By myself? Well, you need all the practice you can get. I can... I can help you if you like. I'm not sure the consul appreciates barn dancing but thanks anyway. I can dance. Is that how you arrest people? You do know I'm supposed to lead? Is that what you're doing? I thought you just looked nervous. I've arrested much worse than you. Oh, I'm scared now. And you should be. You're undone. Got you. How are you, Rod? Listen, just wondering, that nugget that chap brought in last night, you still got it? Yeah, why? I'm a metallurgist. And I always thought you were a doctor. Ah, I'm always galvanising, brazing, plating, can't get enough of the stuff. Anyone ever tell you you're full of it? All the time. Ah. Caused a bit of a fuss last night. At least a half a dozen guys have gone out today with shovels. How many drinks did this thing buy last night? Less than it could have. I told the bloke he could have used it on tick. Said he didn't need tick. He was leaving town. Where was he going? Didn't say. Tell you what, I'll have it back to you within the hour. Make sure you do. I don't trust blow-ins. Have you given any more thought to making the speech tonight? None at all. What do you think, Joe? Well, it's good quality. Reasonable size too. Easy to sing. Would buy you a fair few drinks. Many people coming in with strikes these days? Oh, it's a gold rush town. Perhaps we can expect fist fights in the main street again, eh? Liven things up a bit. Had Arthur ever brought you gold before? He wouldn't come to me. There are bigger dealers. So what would you do, Joe? You're down in the mine, you're swinging your pick, you strike gold. Would you leave town? Probably. I can't stand mines. Tell me, what would you say that is? Uh, quartz? And here, this black stuff on the side? It looks like... I don't know. Some form of carbon. Coal. Coal in a gold seam, is that...? It's not usual. Look, can you please give some more thought to tonight? If you don't do it, I'll have to and I hate public speaking. Me too. Let's see what this thing's worth. Mattie! Just wondering, Mr Stirling rostered on this evening? I can check if you like, why? I want a second opinion. There's a scar on the body I examined. Where's the scar? Left ankle. Anterior or posterior? Anterior. Any atrophy in the leg? Yes. It could be tendon transfer surgery. Post-polio. Polio. Of course. Mattie, you're brilliant. Melbourne General was the only place that did work like that. Are you coming tonight? I'll be busy. Doing what? Haven't decided. Yes, the name was Pike. Arthur Pike. Well, um... I'm guessing the operation would have been some... ..30 odd years ago, yes. Any chance I could come and take a look at those records for myself? Oh, really? That would be tremendous. I'll get it! Thank you! Um, yes, thank you so much. Much appreciated. Eadie! Can we see the doctor? Of course. Don't fuss, I'm alright. No, it's not alright. I'm fine. No, no, no, come through. Come through. Eadie. Scratched it you said, huh? More like a splinter. What from? A fence. I think it's infected. When did this happen? Uh, yesterday. I tried to dig it out last night. Alright. Well, you'll have septicaemia if we don't get a wriggle on. So, hold still for me. And... Ah! There we are. How about that? Now, you're going to need some penicillin so just sit tight. Jean, would you draw me up a penicillin shot, please? Of course. And phone the police. Eadie, you work at the council land titles office, don't you? Yes. I imagine that would involve a lot of digging through records. Now, what was on the other side of that fence that was so important? Eh? You said you got the splinter jumping a fence. Just taking a shortcut home from work. Really? What time? About five. Oh. I saw you at the pub after that. Your hand was fine, you were playing darts. Maybe it was later, I can't remember too well. Oh, really. Ah! That splinter in your hand came from the ladder in Arthur Pike's mine. What? After you left the pub last night, you had Eadie go back and find the exact location of that mine and then you rode over there on your motorcycle. No, no, Russ, listen. You're going to have to concentrate on what you're going to tell the police. What? No, I didn't do it. It's alright. Call a solicitor from here, I'll find the number for you. There's no way Russ killed that man. Evening. Lucien. Alright, he may not have killed him. But he was there last night. And that makes him a killer? No, but it will make the police very curious. Well, Eadie's beside herself. She said YOU called the police. Actually, Jean called them. This isn't funny. Come on. I thought you didn't like him. Russ is an idiot. But he doesn't pretend to be anything else. I thought even you would be able to see that. I'm off to the reception. I won't expect you there. And that was the ABC Studio orchestra with King And Country which provides the perfect entree to my very special guest, the British Consul General, Sir Richard Lambeth, who arrived in Ballarat this afternoon. Welcome, Your Excellency. Thank you. Is this your first visit to Ballarat? It is and what a beautiful place. Beautiful. Wonderful architecture and such generous people. Everyone has been most hospitable. Hospitable. And there's your reception tonight of course. I'm looking forward to it enormously. Her Majesty speaks so warmly about the reception she received here in 1954. It'd be lovely to have one of my own. Lovely. And of course this coincides with the news that Singapore is about to become a fully self-governing colony. As you know, I was on the Malay Peninsula during the war and it simply... You told my wife she's barren because of me. Eric! If it's because of you, that'd mean she's not barren. You come into my house, you poison my marriage. Oh, please! The poisoning occurred long before I showed up on the scene. You're drunk. And you're a liar. Oh, look! The British Consul. Hoorah for Singapore. By the way, I thought you said you were here at the club last night. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, uh... ..on behalf of the British Australia Society... ..it's my pleasure to welcome the British Consul here to... to Ballarat. And... A-and isn't it great to have him here? Terrific work done... Thank you, Joe, thank you. And yes, it's an absolute delight to have the British Consul here. Truly a delight. Richard Lambeth, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him another round of applause, shall we? Thank you, Joe, thank you. You know, I was listening to Dick on the wireless. You don't mind if I call you Dick, do you? Of course not. I was listening to Dick on the wireless. He was talking about the terrific work the Poms are doing in Singapore since the war. Of course, that depends on how you define famine, neglect and revenge killing, really, but none of that, none of that, is Dick's fault. Of course, so let's give him another round of applause! What do you say? Hear! Hear! Yes! Don't call me Dick. Oh, I'm sorry. You should have mentioned. Turns out the Consul doesn't like Dick. Anyway, I was thinking, we love it when the Empire sends one of its own to tell us how splendidly we're all doing. Jolly good. Wonderful, eh? Chin up! Stiff upper lip! Yes, we might have abandoned you lot to die when the Japs attacked. But Dick's here to tell us that everything is just... lovely now. Of course, Singapore is just one in a long line of complete stuff-ups. I mean, how could we forget the sewers, hmm? Or the Song. What about the complete bloody balls-up at Gallipoli? Look, I think it's about time you left. Now. No! You're the one to leave. I lost my wife and my child in Singapore when you lot buggered off. If your lot hadn't been such cowards... Oh, how dare you! Blake! Do you think he'll be alright? Nothing that a night behind bars won't fix. I'm going to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight. Night, Mattie. Goodnight. So much for dancing. Yeah. Thanks to the doc. Well, it w as pretty interesting. Yeah, yes, it was. Goodnight. Goodnight. Punched a cop in the face? Apparently. Why? Because it was there. Proud of yourself? Have you been charged? Detectives are coming up from Melbourne in the morning. I came to you for help. Tell me about how you came to have that piece of ladder in your hand. Why should I? The bloke in the pub said he'd struck gold. I thought I should go take a look. You thought you'd steal it from him? Well, I was going to dig some more up. At night? I'm getting married in a week. I just... I just wanted to give Eadie a honeymoon. Keep talking to me. Tell me about that ladder. It was rotten. As soon as I got on it, the rungs broke under me. Bloody nearly fell in. You must have seen Arthur's car. But there was no light on. Look, I even sang out down the hole. What's wrong with you? I'm just a little bit anxious. All you did was punch someone. They reckon I killed a bloke. A few years ago I was... ..put in a very... confined space for... ..stealing a can of pineapple. How long? 40 days. For a tin of fruit?! Do me a favour, just... Just keep talking, would you? I... Anything. I don't care what it's about. My dad's a dentist. A dentist! Dentistry, I love that, come on. Talk to me about that, tell me all about that. He reckons that putting fluoride in the water's dangerous because nobody knows what it'll do. He reckons if kids ate walnuts, you know, that'll fix everything. Nuts. You know? Fluoride comes from smelting. I mean, do you really want to drink that stuff? ..God, it's like, why would you pay ten shillings for a jumper that your mum can knit you for nothing? I mean, it doesn't make sense. And besides, she loves me. ♪ Well, I'm just starting school ♪ Like a real, real cool ♪ Gonna shake, gonna jive ♪ Get the message that I gotta be alive ♪ I'm a wild boy Ooh, yeah! ♪ I'm a wild boy... ♪ You know anything else? We can place him at the scene but that's all we've got. I've held him on a lesser charge. You were stationed at St Kilda for a while, weren't you? Yeah, a few years ago. Hmm. Really landed on your feet here, haven't you? Yeah, I spoke to the prisoner. He's... Got any tea? Pardon? Tea in a pot. Got any? In the kitchen. One white, one black, no sugar. Where's your interview room? Up the stairs. Bring the prisoner up, can you? Make some tea. Bill. Russ, time to get up. Didn't know your middle name was Radcliffe. After my grandfather. I'm sure he's very proud. Before you charge that boy, you should talk to Eric Reid. Why would I do that? I don't think Russ is capable of killing anyone. It's out of my hands. Homicide are on to him. I... I am truly sorry, Matthew. People have been very patient with me and... ..I certainly wouldn't blame them if they decided they'd had quite enough. Is this a confession? Are you a priest? So you ever bloody stop? Arthur Pike's not the bloke's real name. His driver's licence was forged. No record of him anywhere. I thought you said this was out of your hands. The body has a scar from tendon replacement surgery. Melbourne General was the only hospital doing that kind of work. Anything else I should know? You really should talk to Eric Reid. He said he was at the club when Arthur was killed but he didn't sign in. And why would Eric Reid kill him? Oh, I don't know. You do realise that given your arrest last night, I'm required by law to sack you? Yes. But I'd rather you didn't. You made a splash. I'm afraid I don't remember it too well. Wish I could say the same. I thought I might take a drive down to Melbourne later on if the afternoon's free. Who do you think you are, Lucien? I embarrassed you. Oh, I don't care about the embarrassment. It's the lecturing I don't like. And the fact that you think you're the only one who matters. Everyone in that room lost someone or something. You're not the only one. You embarrassed yourself. But you insulted the rest of us. Just through the back, thanks. Ah, Mr Springer. Is the doctor in? No, he's in Melbourne. But I can make an appointment, if you like. No, I don't want an appointment. I want an apology. And then I never want to see him again. Right. Well, I'll pass that on. Do that. You tell him from me he's an arrogant fool. Sorry, I won't be telling him that. No, no, that'll be right. You work for him, don't you? I have my own mind, Mr Springer. You know what people say about the two of you. I will let him know that you called! God, I hate polio. You have a patient. Mrs Reid? Thank you, Jean. Margaret. What a surprise. I thought after last night you'd be changing doctors. Actually, I agree with everything you said. Not that I'd tell Eric. Well, you did tell Eric about your test results. I thought you didn't want him to know. He wondered you came to our house. I'm sorry, he can be... Persuasive? He can be a bully. Ah. Doctor, I think I might be pregnant. Does Eric know? No. And you believe Arthur Pike is the father? Your reaction to his death was not the reaction of a landlady. There was an unopened bottle of champagne in his room. And I think he was planning a celebration with female company and of course, Eric is unable to have children. You know of course Arthur Pike is not his real name? Yes. It was John Strickland. Who was he? I don't know what he'd done. But he was kind. He should never have told people he'd found the gold. So why did he? Really, why? Especially given the fact that he didn't actually find any. But he did. I saw it. Where did he keep it? I don't know. Doctor... I was going to leave Eric. John was overjoyed about the baby. What can I do? Brian? What's happened here? Brawly last night. Five blokes injured. Ah. Blow-ins? I'd love a beer. Yeah, mate. Russ Barlow's been charged with the murder of Arthur Pike. Actually, his name was John Strickland. You learned that down in Melbourne? No, Margaret told me. Who was he? Absolutely no idea. But he had an affair with Margaret. What? Well, we can rule Eric Reid out. Thank you, Brian. He was busy on the night of the murder. Doing what? I would have thought a bloke like you would at least have a stab at it. No! Eric... Bloody hell! Woman swears he was with her. Apparently their usual Wednesday night. Happy family there. Anyhow, Margaret said she saw the gold. Where is it now? I thought I told you to piss off! There's no gold here. Maybe we're just not looking hard enough. I know because I bloody looked for it. This used to be my claim. It must have made you pretty angry when you found out he'd struck gold. You know, I'm still curious. What is down there? Nothing. Really? Maybe I'll just take a little look. You want to shoot me? Hmm? You want to kill me? And then what? You thought about that? Look, I worked this mine for ten years. There was nothing and then this bastard strikes it rich. It would have driven me mad too. But you've got a decision to make. You either shoot me in the back. Or you get the hell out of here right now. What?! Did you report it? No. He took a shot at you. Yes. Well, I imagine people are lining up for the chance. I'm sure you're probably right. Um, Jean... If you were running away from town with your adulterous lover... ..what would you do? And this is something I don't want anyone to know about? You most certainly do not. Well, I'd make appointments for the following day knowing I'd never make them. I'd be sure of where I was going to. And then I'd pack the car. Apparently, John Strickland was interviewed about a gold theft two years ago. They couldn't find anything on him. How much was stolen? £20,000. Taken from a dealer in Melbourne. Hmm, listen, do me a favour. Charge Jan Vernick with gross stupidity and confiscate his rifle, would you? Sir, we've got it! Oh! Ah... Old ingots are stamped. He must have molten them down. You see a foundry out there anywhere? No. That would be how he got the blue marks on the arm. Whoever killed him came back and ransacked his room. And they're probably still looking. You think Vernick had something to do with it? I don't know. What kind of car does he drive? Well, Jan doesn't drive a car. Oh, my head hurts. There's some Bex in the bathroom cupboard. Crazy old Jan Vernick's at the mine. And there's a car there. Thing is, Jan Vernick doesn't own a car. Stolen? The gold was stolen, not the car. By the way, Joe Springer dropped in earlier to see you. Yeah? Is he armed as well? I think he'd appreciate an apology. Yes, I... I probably should do that. You do have something in common. He took over the family business too. It's a tragic story, really. They were gold merchants in Melbourne until his father got robbed and he lost everything. £20,000. His father died soon after that and Joe moved the business here with his mother to start afresh. Jean, I'm a bloody fool. Well, I wouldn't go that far. No, no, no, the car. It's his car. He's still looking for the gold. Hello? Are you here? Over here. Where are you? Here. Oh, Joe. Are you hurt? I don't think so but I can't move. The wall caved in. I was just having a look around. That's alright, Joe, I know why you're here. £20,000 worth of gold stolen from your father's safe. And John Strickland was his accounts clerk. Who? Joe, come on. You know, that chap you recognised who walked into the pub. Hang on, hang on. My dad saved for his retirement his whole life. And it was gone in one night. Ruined him. He was already sick. But after that, he just... ..stopped eating. Wasted away, did nothing. He was murdered. Just as if he'd been stabbed in the heart. Well... ..we found the gold. It was in Strickland's car the whole time. Ah, just leave me down here. I'm afraid I can't do that, Joe. Still don't understand why Strickland chose to announce it to the whole world. Imagine, £20,000 worth of gold to explain away. What are you going to do? Buy a mine and announce you struck gold. He just chose the wrong pub to do it in. Sir, bloke in the cell just had a bit of an accident. Go on. I need to talk to you about this business. Hello, lads. Good to see you again. Bring Barlow along, we're taking him into remand. Uh, you just missed him. Missed him? Yeah. I let him go. What, you haven't heard? you charged the wrong bloke. It's easy to do when you're still learning. Did it myself once. The real culprit's downstairs. Here's his confession. Get you some tea? First of all, Eric, let me just say, thank you for coming in, I know you didn't want to. I owe you two apologies. Firstly, I apologise for insulting you and indeed the entire town at the reception. I have no excuses. The Brits have always done the right thing by us. Yes. And apology number two. There was a mistake with Margaret's tests. The results got mixed up with someone else's and I... ..I jumped to conclusions. The lab sent their profuse apologies as do I, of course. But the good news is, there's absolutely no reason why you can't have children. That is good news, isn't it, darling? I always knew it wasn't my fault. Yeah, well, it was never anyone's fault, Eric. Now, you have a very special wife. And if you want to have kids... ..you're going to have to be very kind to her. It's not that bad, you know. Jean's a goddess with a needle. It's the model I take issue with. You look amazing. When I take it off, you can have it. Not sure it'll fit. Well, it's the only way you'll ever get into my dress. Eric? Thank you. Ah, no more patients? I told you, you'd offended people. I certainly never meant to insult you. And you're right. I was only thinking of myself. And I know I'm not the only person who lost someone. How dare you? You did to her what you did to me. You are going to pay for what you've done. Hazel died before she was hanged. Don't you open your mail these days? Your wife and child were last seen there, weren't they? Yes. Their search continues. Patient died on your watch two years ago, a Mrs Ferguson who left you her estate. You're a loose cannon, Blake. Get out of here before you do any more damage. You have my resignation. Effective immediately. Piece by piece, you've unravelled everything your father has built.
