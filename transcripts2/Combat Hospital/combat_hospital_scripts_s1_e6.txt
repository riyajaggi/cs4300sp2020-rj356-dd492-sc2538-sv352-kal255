 There you go. Well, one thing you can say about the royal marines-- they throw a mean beach party. Too bad there's no beach. Or ocean. God, is that pool water even safe? You mean the dust? Yeah. If it hasn't killed you by now, I wouldn't worry. Here. Thanks. Any of these make your mouth water? Not hungry. My ex-husband spoiled my appetite.

 Besides, you know what the military says about fraternization. Mm-hmm. Yes, it's against regulations. Why do they call it "fraternization"? Why don't they just call it "sororitization"? What's your type? Uh, there. Ladies. Hello. How are the virgin margaritas? Nothing virgin about this drink. Want a sip? Against regulations. Cheers. Against regulations? Well, all good things in life are. So where's Dr. puppy dog? Who? You know, Dr. Bobby, with the tats and the big brown eyes?

 Oh. Bobby is doing research-- the whole needle decompression-- to "prove his theory," and frankly, uh, I think he's getting kind of full of himself. Well, if he's right, he'll be saving lives. I save lives, and you don't see me always talking about it. Competitive much? No, I'm not competitive-- Dr. Hill, call for you. He says it's your-- Yeah, I know who it is. Tell him I'm in surgery. If you'll excuse me. He does have a great ass for a selfish, arrogant neurosurgeon. Mm-hmm. You know what? I am not the least bit competitive. No. No. Shut up. I'm eating my burger. Oh, shoot. All right. Keep the dust off that for me, please. Captioned by closed captioning services, inc. Oh! B.P. 100 over 60. Please. It hurts. Pulse 123. Where's Flacks? Let's get another I.V. In him. Uh, hold on, buddy. Just a few more seconds, okay? Sarge said he'd bring him. I need Flacks. I need him. Just take it easy, okay? We're gonna need to roll him. Suzy, can I get you back on this side to control the head? And we're gonna do this on three. Okay? One, two, three. We're low on fluids. Okay, he's losing volume. Let's patch him up straight away. O.R. 1 is ready. All right, come on, guys. Let's go. Go. Keep pressure on it. We're opening bay 4. Make a hole. Coming through! Take him to bay 2. Max. Rebecca. Possible shrapnel wound to the belly, lower right quadrant to left lower flank. F.A.S.T. Shows intra-abdominal fluid. He's bleeding from somewhere. All right, let's get him in. If the bowel is perfed, he's gonna get septic fast. Is there an O.R. open? 2's good to go. Where's Flacks? Sarge said he was coming. Was your friend injured? Was he hurt? No, he was on the other truck. O.R. 3's ready. O.R. let's prep. Come on. Next! Wait! Wait! Did you see Flacks? No, man. He said he'd be here. Hey, guys, I got him. Wait. Don't bring me in there yet. H-hold on, Rebecca. Sarge! We got here as fast as we could. Give me some of your luck, man. You're gonna be fine, buddy. I promise. Can we go now? Hey, doc. Thanks for coming. Got some boys here who need to talk it out. You think maybe you could do a group session? How's, um, 1400 hours? Sounds good. What's going on over there? That is the unit's lucky charm. Yeah. They insisted that we fly him in with the wounded. Excuse me. Dr. Pedersen? Ariel Garamond, out of Kabul. One of the p.A.S. Oh, of course, Ariel. I remember you. It's been a while since you've been here. You fly in with these soldiers? Yeah. I-I, uh, overheard you, that you're having a s-session later? Yeah. Would it be all right if I joined in? I look forward to seeing you there. Suction. I need a clear field here. So what's up with Simon and those calls to England? I heard he got a girl pregnant, and she's after him for paternity. He's too smart for that. It's a gambling debt. He's lost almost $1 million. All right. Let's find the next bleed. If he lost that much money, how'd he afford to buy all those rugs? Son of a bitch. The bullet entered here, just nicked the bowel, missed the bladder, passed just underneath the bifurcation of the aorta, missed the iliac veins, and then shot by the sacrum. That lucky charm kid they brought in must be the real deal. The soldier rubbed his head bullet hardly did any damage. Yes, the head rubbing and the most definitely healed any wounds this guy had prior to said head rubbing. Let's run the bowel just in case. We shouldn't have to make choices between running over a child and running our trucks over I.E.D.S. The human nervous system isn't cut out for that. Everything you're feeling is--is valid. There was no right decision to be made. Ariel? You want to share? S-s-sometimes... When we land the choppers and I know there are men out there... Wounded... My whole body freezes. You know, like I'm afraid to move. What do you think that's about? It's obvious. People are shooting. Understood. I mean, I... I get over it quickly and everything, but... Do you? Shoot. I gotta take this. I'm sorry, guys. Hello, Max. Damnedest thing. That open compound fracture? No neurovascular injury at all, very little soft tissue damage, no contamination. It reduced perfectly in the O.R. That's one lucky soldier. Not a big fan of luck. You're in a mood. Your patient didn't make it? No, he's okay, but not because of the intervention of some divine force. Hey, colonel. Careful, Rebecca. You speak ill of Fortuna, she'll turn her back on you. The Roman goddess of fortune and luck? Please don't tell me you think she's real, sir. Oh, she is, Rebecca. I give her her due respect, she favors me, but you gotta have faith. Well, then what does that make, uh, what's his name-- Flacks? Who knows why she favors some and not others? I believe we make our own luck, sir. Well, all I can say is, with Flacks around, I'm feeling mighty fortunate today, you know? Sir, new scanner just arrived, for real this time. Boys are bringing it in. B-met tech is gonna calibrate it. I think it's gonna be ready to go tout de suite. Bravo, Graham! Bravo to you, sir. Lady luck. Hi. Sorry about that, doc. I had to file a report. Oh, no worries. By any chance, are you free for dinner tonight? I was hoping we could talk. Uh, well, it--it's not my usual business hours. Right. But I can make an exception. Well, how's 1900 at the d-fac? Okay. Thanks. Flacks, what have I told you? It's cool, sergeant. He can touch it. Beg your pardon, sir, but if you don't watch him, he'll muck things up. You know what ultrasound is used for, private? Well, in "the surveyor," issue 78, page 3, evil Dr. Richmond tried to use a-a hyper ultrasound transducer to try and remove kid cost's biosuit, but when he-- Enough, Flacks. Uh, I thought he was your lucky charm. He is, ma'am, but he's a bit of a freak. Whoa. That's a harsh word, sergeant. Everyone calls me that. When I was 3, my, uh, mom, dad, brothers, and I were in a car crash. They all died, but I flew through the windshield and landed in a bush. They say it was a freak of luck, but my parents, they weren't so lucky. I'm sorry to hear of your loss. Okay, as your senior officer, I command you guys to go get some grub. Yes, sir. Come on, you two. Hey. So, uh, you want to go check out the barbecue on the boardwalk, see if it's any good? Colonel Marks. Yeah. Sir, you asked me to tell you when I had finished my study about routine needle decompression in the field. Oh, right. Anyways, I finished all my prelim work. I'm just looking to get some help organizing things. Suzy Chao has got her master's in public health, right? Yeah, that's right. How long do you need her for? Two hours. Three at the most. All right. Okay. I'll let her know. What's so wrong with being competitive? I mean, it's not like it's some big character flaw. So I rise to the top of my class and I become a great surgeon. I just-- I want to do my best. Do you want to do your best or do you want to be the best? I want to do my best. Of course, I can't help it if my best just happens to be better than everyone else's. I can't. Come on in, corporal. We're just, uh, finishing up here. Dinner later? Rain check? I've got a session. You know, you never have time for me anymore. Out. I thought you were gonna get some food with your sergeant. Don't tell sarge. He'll get mad. Private... Are they treating you all right-- the sarge and everyone? 'Cause if they're not, you know, I-I can talk to them-- No, no, don't be angry with him. Sarge is a-- he's a good guy. He takes care of me, makes sure I don't screw up. Please just... Don't say I complained. I'll do better. I promise. It's--it's not about doing better. Sarge and the guys are the only family I got. So please, doc. I just-- Okay, okay. Flacks, don't worry. I won't say a word. He's ready. In issue one of the "snow brigade," they hooked Sam snow up just like this after he gets hit by a nuclear radiation blast from a falling asteroid. They took out all his organs, and they gave 'em to other people. Each one wakes up with a different superpower, and they become the snow brigade. If he dies, are you gonna take out his organs? We don't do that kind of thing. Maybe you should get some food. I'm not really hungry, ma'am. It's--my stomach kinda-- it-- Whoa! Okay. Damn it. I need some help! Okay. All right, easy. Take it easy, soldier. B.P. Is 92 over 59. Pulse 110 and thready. You're clammy. You say your stomach's hurting? Yeah, my stomach, side. It's kinda into the back. I'll page Bobby. Nurse. So these are all the cases that I've compiled from the last three years. I'm glad someone's finally looking at this. You know, the nurses have suspected this for a while now. What? Nothing. Go on. So I'm not really good at statistics, but I was just thinking that if you could just show me a program that I could plug in all the information, like who received needle decompression in the field, did they really need them, um, where there any complications. You got another idea? Ah, nuts. Okay. I gotta take this. Uh, everything's in the spreadsheet, all right? I'll, uh, I'll be right back. What's up? Syncope, pain in the abdomen, radiating to left flank and back. The f.A.S.T. Is clear. Guarding. Did he sustain any injuries in the blast? No, sir. My-- my truck wasn't hit. All right, what did he do this time? Sergeant, your man is very ill. So I suggest that you stand down. Clear? Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. I just-- Let's get him in the scanner. C.T. scan shows he's got a ruptured diaphragm. It's a like a hole. He probably injured it when he was thrown from the car as a child. If he's had it that long, why is it dangerous now? Here, watch your back. Here. We can take that. Thank you, guys. Well, sometimes the stomach can balloon through the hole. The diaphragm snaps, then the stomach gets trapped, strangulated. It's very serious. Mary Mayhew in-- in the "snow brigade," issue 2, page 14, she got shot in the stomach, and they gave her Sam snow's stomach and intestines. She became peptilla. Sir, how long before he recovers? My men, they want to know. Assure your men that private Flacks will be all right, but his days in Afghanistan are over. But he's our luck, sir. Now a good leader cares about his men. He doesn't just think of them as objects. Their welfare should always be utmost in his mind. Understand? Yes, sir. Good. This is going to make you sleepy. Wait. Just a sec. Doc. What can I do for you, son? Listen. Mm-hmm. In case I don't make it-- Son, if you don't make it, I'm gonna have the anger of the whole U.S. army raining down on my head. I know. Mm-hmm. But just in case, I'm an organ donor. Son, you don't have to worry. I know, but Sam snow would've died, but since they took his organs, he achieved immortality. It's like... Living beyond your death. He still became the hero. We don't have provisions for soldiers who are organ donors here in this hospital, so you're gonna have to make it through this surgery in one piece, and I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that's exactly what happens. Deal? All right. This is a little more private than the d-fac. What's on your mind? Well, I wanted to ask you... Are you gay? Why do you ask? Because I, uh... I find you really attractive. And I think you feel the same way about me. You've been under a lot of stress and-- It's just that every time I-I see you, you always have this special smile, you know, just for me. I thought you were just being nice, but I'm always so glad to see you. And then in session today, I... felt a connection. There's a, uh, a concept in therapy called, uh, transference. So you're not gay? This is not about me. This is about you. So you are. Maybe you're confusing your feelings... Because-- I'm pretty sure I know my feelings. And I think I know what yours are. If I've misled you in any way, I'm sorry, but I'm your doctor, and this is e-extremely inappropriate. I need you to leave. If you'd like, we can discuss this tomorrow, during my office hours. Well, think about it. I'm a great catch. So much for Flacks' luck. Well, if Flacks had been anywhere else in Kandahar, he would've been in a lot of trouble. He would've lost part or all of his stomach. But he happened to be in a hospital that happens to have gotten a new C. T. scanner that was able to pick up on a diaphragm rupture. Can you cut that, please? Thank you. Plus, he has a couple of brilliant surgeons to repair it. You know, whenever I've encountered people who aren't believers, I've found out that it's because fortune has turned their back on them at some point or another. Is that true with you, Rebecca? I think I may have gotten some sunburn this morning. Something wrong? My daughter... We loved to surf. There. Yes, I-I... I think you did get a little sunburn. Your arms are a bit pink. You know if you ever want to talk... Oh, I'm all right, Rebecca. Thank you. Whenever you need, I am here. Good night. Oh, good night. Oh, crap. He came out of anesthesia. Colonel Marks said to take him off the ventilator. That's when he developed dyspnea. He is in pain. Do something! Okay, he's systolic. C. 80. All right, this guy just threw a p.E. Let's get him to a scanner now. You require my presence? He has a possible blood clot in his lung. I thought about taking him in for surgery, but surgical outcomes in p. E.S are never good, and besides, I think he's too weak. Okay. Never saw you as a team player. Why don't you give him TPA and put him on anticoagulants? You don't need me to figure this out. Why didn't you call, um... ah. You don't want to call Bobby because you're jealous of him. Simon, I called you in here because, if I put him on blood thinners to dissolve a clot and he has a brain bleed-- Yes. Yes, you want me on board even though I'm a selfish, arrogant neurosurgeon with a great ass. And apparently, great hearing. This one is an odd duck. Do you know that he wanted to donate his organs because of a comic book? Really? Well, I'm all for organ donation. It's the highest form of recycling. I like your tats. I got 'em in prison. Um... you know, if you don't want to talk about it... They're kind of personal. Okay. This is an I-ching trigram. So distal to proximal, it reads, "wind," and proximal to distal, it reads "lake." Well, what's it mean? If you put wind over lake, it signifies inner truth, and lake over wind signifies contentment and success. So I like to think that, if you're true to yourself, you'll always have success. How's his pt/ptt? Almost in normal limits. You believe in luck, will? I believe we make our own. Thank you. With the good lord's help. Hey, question. Why can't we deal with organ donations here? Well, if a soldier's brain dead, we harvest the organs, we put it in a cooler, and it takes about 18 hours to get to a hospital that does transplants. By that time, the organs would be of no use, so, no, there is no protocol because it would be useless. So you think this guy won't make it? Oh, well, according to colonel Marks, this guy is the luckiest man on earth. Hmm. Grace. Ariel here was telling me how she worked on the transnational bike racac yeah, I was one of the, uh, volunteer medics, so I got to lance a lot of blisters, most of them not on feet. Well, uh, you'll have to excuse me. Pam and I are heading up to the, uh, the women's clinic. Pam is assisting me with an appendectomy. But Ariel here has volunteered to stand in. Oh. It's just--I've heard so much about your clinic, and I think what you're doing is wonderful. I-I'd love to help. Well, thank you. All right. So I'll let you two get to work. Thank you for getting me that bike chain. No problem. I mean, this woman is incredibly resourceful. Yes, yes. Yes, she is. Good. Sergeant. I heard Flacks had something happen with his lungs last night. Yeah, it was a complication with the surgery. He developed a clot, and it went to his lung, which interfered with his breathing, but, uh, we're keeping an eye on him. Major, I'm not a mean person. It's just-- Basically, Flacks can be a pain in the ass. He's always getting into trouble, going on about those comic books. Okay. Well, you don't have to explain to me, okay? The way I treat him-- I feel bad. It's just--I'm trying to keep him out of trouble and all. The little... he can be a handful. Is he gonna make it? I hope so, sergeant. I hope so. Your patient Flacks is vomiting, left pupil dilated. Damn it. Why didn't they call me? That's why you got me on board. But I've given him mannitol, protamine, vitamin k-- everything--uh, but his brain shift is too great. So we need to evacuate the blood. They're prepping now. Do you want to assist? Can he survive the surgery? Uh, well, yeah, as long as his luck's holding up. Salaam alaikum. Hey. Salaam alaikum. Karim, hey, my little man. Grace. We have a full house. I see. Ariel. Salaam alaikum. Walaikum salaam. Shall we set up? Great. Come on, sweetheart. How's my little lamb been, huh? Are you okay? All right. Let's flush this, please. Dr. Hill... There's an urgent call. You have got to be kidding me. They said if you knew who was calling-- Yeah, I know who's calling! Okay? Just tell him I'm in Jamaica. I can't be reached. Look, I am up to my elbows in private Flacks' brains. Do you want to argue with me? Do you want to explain that? I wish these patients would just... behave. Oh, my God. I was right. Yes, you were. No, no, I mean, like, really right. Like statistically, significantly right. Do you know what this means? I mean, my work--research I did--is gonna have an impact on how we deal with pneumothoraces in the field. Lives are gonna be saved. I mean, I-I get to publish a paper with my name on it. Tell her she's healing nicely. She needs to keep it clean and dry and put the ointment on once a day. Very good. We're not here to treat farm animals. I think there's something you need to see over here, Dr. Pedersen. We can't have a goat in here. The goat is injured. Her husband will punish her for not taking care of it. I said I'd fix the goat if she'd let you take a look at her. Here. Come with me. It's okay. It's okay. Go. There you are. Hasti? Hmm? Can you--can you ask her to take off the burka? It's all right. You're very brave. Good girl. Very good. You'll be all right. I'm famished. Want to share a plate of food? You know... seriously, Simon, you're a jerk and everything, but if there's something wrong-- I mean, those phone calls-- Oh, that's not a problem. That's just, uh... It's just a nuisance. Shall we? Well... There's no broken bones, but there's Marks and scars all over her body. What a a her options? If she leaves her husband and goes back to her parents, they'll be disgraced. They'll beat her and send her back to her husband. Badri's sister has a job in Kabul. She'd be safe there. I can get her to a safe house, but how to get her to Kabul... I have a pilot friend that owes me a favor. How fast can you write up that section? We're on duty in another two hours. Right. Work. What a concept. Here you go. Thanks, man. Um, I'll be right back. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hey, guys. How's Flacks? Uh, stable. Yeah, barely. Simon is being Mr. optimist today. Did I tell you guys what I found out? Uh, can I get one Italian, no tomatoes, no onions? Coming right up, major. Turns out I was right about the needle decompression. There's a significant statistical increase in complications that outweigh the benefits of doing the procedure. There you go. Um, that's great... Bobby. Yeah. That's good. Hey, can I have roast beef with, uh, you know, all the trimmings? Yes, sirree, Dr. Hill. So are you, uh, you tapping that? No, I'm not tapping that. We're colleagues. Plus, I respect women. It's not all about sex. Tell Suzy that. Hey, saved you a spot. Hey. And I was thinking, when we write up the analysis, we could do it within the context of previous usages. Great. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That sounds good. Yeah, absolutely. How's your pizza? Why are these buns always soggy? We're in the middle of a bloody desert! Why is there always something with you? What? Noise. Flacks! Is he okay, doc? He went into a tonic-clonic seizure. Pupils fixed and dilated bilaterally. He's brain dead. All right, should I call it? Wait. Flacks wanted to be an organ donor. I told you, there's no protocol. No, we don't put his organs in a freezer. We keep his organs in his body, keep Flacks on the respirator, and ship his body out to Landstuhl. I don't know about that. I j-- No, look, if I can create a precedent, then I can create a protocol. Oh, I see what you're trying to do. You're trying to up Dr. Puppy Dog, publish before he does, and then you can win colonel Marks' approval. Oh, Simon. Shut up. Look, not everyone is like you, okay? Okay, look, we send men who are brain dead to Landstuhl on respirators so that their families can come say their last good-byes. Yes, but Flacks has no family. Just let me go talk to colonel Marks about it. I need 30 minutes at most. You're the doctor. What you're suggesting is tricky. It'll take a lot of coordination between the German organ donor bank, a harvesting team, Landstuhl. No, I know, sir, but I can create a precedent, rewrite the protocol. Look, there are people who are waiting for lungs, hearts, corneas, and Flacks' gift can make a difference in their lives. And if I can help with that, then... The organ bank for Germany is called Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation. I'll have, uh, Kelly get you the number. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. All right, I'm gonna go tell will to wait on taking Flacks off the ventilator. Okay, well, tell him I'm in friggin' Afghanistan. I can't be on hold. Yes. Yes, I got your messages. Well, that's why I'm calling you now. No, listen. Listen to me. Just transfer the money, okay? Yeah, just transfer it. I know. I know what the consequences are. Okay. Thank you. What are you trying to prove? I'm not trying to prove anything. Yes, you are. You're trying to prove that I've got feelings for you. So let me make it easier for you and just be upfront. All right? I do. You are an attractive, intelligent woman, and I-I enjoy your company. But it's not about sexuality. Well, then is this about the military's restrictions on sexual relationships? It's not about that. We--we could just be friends and see where it goes. I'm just not available. I'm sorry. No, I know that he doesn't have a family, but that doesn't mean that his... No, sir. Right, but the organ bank in Germany has already agreed, so... No, sir. Yes, sir, but w-- Oh. Will, do you ever consider where the state of medical technology will be five, ten years from now? I've been waiting for one of those, I don't know, medical scanners from "star trek." I would kill for a lightsaber scalpel. Those things would come in handy with the doctors, wouldn't they? And the Vickerdale guy. Hey. Good news, Rebecca? The German organ bank is on board with it, but they won't allow us to do anything until Landstuhl agrees. Now Landstuhl refuses to receive Flacks on a ventilator unless there is a medical or a family reason. And they won't allow us to fly him to another hospital in Germany because he is a soldier. And can I just say, for the record, sir, that this whole thing just really sucks? It really sucks and it pisses me off. Well noted, major. Get his buddies. Let 'em say their last good-byes. You tried. It was a good idea, sir. Excuse me. Um, I am so sorry to say that private Flacks didn't make it. Were you able to do the organ donation? I mean, it was crazy, but it was something he wanted. I, um... I'm sorry. I'll--I'll give you guys 30 minutes. I hate protocols, I hate rules and regulations, and I especially hate the people who follow them blindly. Hey. What's going on? Private Flacks is brain dead, and I tried to fulfill his dying wish, I did. And I could not sway the higher ups. And Simon-- Simon says that-- that I was doing it to compete against Bobby and--and--and to get colonel Marks' approval, which is... Were you? No. That is not why I was doing this. Look... he was just a kid. Okay? Yeah, he was a little off, but he shouldn't have had to die alone in a hospital in Kandahar. This whole thing just seems... meaningless. He... he is dead, and he doesn't have a family to remember him by. He'll just be forgotten. Will you forget him? So I told will that I'd have you back in three hours, and it's been, what, like-- almost 24. Time flies when you're having fun. I'm gonna get some sleep. Later? Later. Heard you tried to help out Flacks. Yeah. Didn't work. And there goes the plane to Landstuhl. I gotta go take Flacks off the ventilator. Want me to come with? Why do you do that? What? Well, you're just-- you're just so damn nice. You're so good, and here I am, jealous, hating you because you're so... You're so frickin' zen, dude. You're--you're so Mr. "I'm such a good guy," and you found something that, like, you're really excited about, and it's all you talk about, and then you still-- you come up to me and ask me if I want you to come with. I mean, what kind of guy does that? You hate me? No. No, I don't hate you. You're just so damn nice, and you care so much about your patients-- Hey, y-yeah, but mostly... I want people to like me. It's not always the case, but... I try. What? Look, I figure, if I could help people out, maybe they'd like me. What? It's not funny. It's... it's not funny. Wow. Come here. Oh. Are you okay? I'm good. I am really proud of the research that you're doing. I am. It's good work, Bobby. Doctor. A moment. I'm just going to remove Flacks from the ventilator, sir. Well, that'll be difficult, 'cause he's on a plane to Landstuhl-- On the plane, on a ventilator. Turns out that Kelly here was resourceful and found one of Flacks' relatives. Chief warrant officer Jasper Wong of the U.S. army. Quite a coincidence, really. He's stationed in Germany. Long-lost cousin. On his, uh, father's side. Thank you, sir. You lied? You have been busting my proverbial balls about following the rules, following regulations, toeing the line, and you lied? I would call it more of a clerical miscommunication than a lie, ma'am. Right. Okay. Oh. So act first and ask forgiveness later. Easy for colonel. Not so easy for a major. Now you're learning. We got our precedent. Now I want you to write a report on ways to create this new protocol. Clear? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Sir, uh, there's another-- Wong? It was the first thing I could come up with. Looks good. Sirs. Sirs. Yeah. We finished our report. Have a look. Okay. All right. Well done. Excuse me. Thank you, sir. All right. Doctor. Yeah. I thought you should know, at 1922 hours, private Flacks officially died. Thank you, sir. And thanks to you, a 16-year-old girl has got a new kidney, a young boy can now see because of new corneas, a young mother has a new lung, and a gunnery sergeant received a new heart. Well, you made the call, sir. You made it happen. I didn't. Rebecca, it was your idea. I just made the luck. Well done. Thank you, sir. Well done. All right, then. Back to work. See you. Good night.
