 Combat Hospital (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 7 - Reckless - full transcript 
 It's "Kebob's your Uncle Eating Contest" at Kandahar Air force Base. On her way to the festivities Major Rebecca Gordon runs into PJ's Ford and Mehra as they embark on a long flight. Their pilot, USAF Lieutenant Ray Ludford asks her for stimulants before the trip, but Rebecca refuses on personal and professional grounds. A fun day is turned into a nightmare as dozens of military personnel and contestants fall ill due to tainted kebob meat. During the chaos, a call comes in -- a helicopter went down and a severely injured Pilot Ray, Mehra and Ford are brought in on stretchers. As the Flight Surgeon and Colonel Marks fight to save Pilot Ray's life, Rebecca is faced with answering to an investigative committee who threaten to lay the responsibility for the accident at her feet. Meanwhile things heat up with Captain Bobby Trang and Major Suzy Chao. Dr. Simon Hill has to deal with a dispute between his farm tenants and Rebecca's Special Forces Officer comes to see Bobby with a mysterious illness.

 - We eat that for a snack, man. - That's right. We would've won. Hey, you guys, where are you going? Wrong direction. - Party's that way. - Uh, we just got beeped. We gotta be in Hutal by nightfall. Hey, have you seen Bobby? 'Cause I bet him a week's worth of coffee that the Canadians were gonna beat the Americans under the table. The way our team's chowing down, you're gonna lose that money. Okay, the U.S. may have a higher obesity rate than Canada, but we know how to eat kebabs. Douche bags. - What's up, man? - Hey, Ray. How's it going? The beautiful Dr. Rebecca Gordon.

 Mm. Marry me. I will take you away from all of this. We'll settle in Florida, have a whole lot of babies. Hmm. I think that I'll stick with trauma surgery in Kandahar. Well... - Burn! - Burn! Dr. Rebecca, I'm in a bit of a bind here. Hmm. Uh, long story short, we have a hell of a stretch to Hutal, and I need me some go. "Go"? As in pill-poppin', "need for speed" kind of go? Mm. That is for your flight surgeon to deal with. Yeah, he's all the way across base, but you are right here, and the pharmacy is just inches away. I'm sorry. Ray, I don't feel comfortable handing out a heavy-duty stimulant like candy. Are you serious? This is standard stuff, plus, we are practically engaged here. No, we are nowhere near engaged, and the answer is still no. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, look, if... If you need some downtime... You know what? Just forget I asked. Enjoy your kebabs. Yes, can you believe how fast these contestants are slamming those little pieces of piggy down their throat? And the first person is France to slow down, and she is out! Deutschland has had too much. Australia is still in, and the Canadian is still going strong, and America is out! Yeah! And the Netherlands drops out! Deutschland and Hungary not so hungry anymore, but Romania and Canada still going strong. Romania... Romania looks... and no, he is over. He is out! We have a winner... The Canadian from the Kabul base! Oh! Whoo! I say, to hell with country and base battles, 'cause I... am repping the estrogen empire! Whoo! What do I win, sir? You have won this fetching blue ribbon. May I pin it on you? Wow. Thanks. Wait, wait. What about the guy in the tower? Are we doing this, or are we doing this? Really? Yeah. Let's go. Get up here now. Come on! Ohh. Come here. Come here. Mm. Mm. Wait, wait, wait. Shh. Ohh. I think I heard someone. No, you didn't. You didn't hear Marks or Will or anyone else, so... Ooh. Hey, hey. Yeah. Ooh, yeah. Thank you. No, thank you. Ohh. Why is it that you're everywhere work isn't? Oh, come now, Rebecca. A man who spends all day on the rumor mill... He deserves some sort of respite, doesn't he? God, you are just all walls and wisecracks, aren't you? Yeah. Well... I'm not exactly alone behind the great wall now, am I? You spend all hours of the night jogging around the base like you're being chased. Why exactly? Mm. That's gonna be a problem. Yeah, more than you know. That's the chef. Mm. Mm. The whole "no sex on base" rule... Marks doesn't take it seriously, right? No, he takes everything seriously. We could get kicked off base for this? We could roll over an I.E.D. and get shipped home in a coffin. That's comforting. Mm. Ohh. It's Kandahar, Bobby. Every day is a risk. So the question is, you want to take this risk with me? Ohh. Oh, no. Gotta go. Gotta go. - Mm. - Where's my shirt? - Here. Swap. - Here. Is that mine or yours? That's yours. No, that's yours. Just wait there. I'm gonna get to you. Shrapnel rips through walls... Everyone's fine. One cook with gastro grills meat... Role 3 task force, Kandahar South. Corday speaking. I lose half the base. A 9-liner? Thank you. Downed chopper? Is it one of ours? Make up as many bottles of oral rehydration solution as possible. Okay, so it's, uh, bacterial, not viral? Most likely. Symptoms came on two hours after exposure. We're still waiting on the cultures. Okay. Did we page everyone? Yeah, if they're not puking their guts out, they're on their feet helping out, except for Bobby, Suzy, and Simon. Yeah, well... Colonel. Have an incoming 9-liner. Downed chopper 91. Three injured. No other information. Did they say who? All I know is, Ray's bringing it in. Uh, TOC's still trying to decipher the details. E.T.A.'s about 30 minutes. Which means the investigative team will be here in 31 minutes. Listen, I want everyone to cooperate. They're gonna be asking a lot of questions. Some of it may seem invasive, but remember, these men are just trying to do their job. Cockroaches. We'll get the ready room prepped for our ailing kebab friends. We're gonna want to bring in the flight surgeon for this 9-liner. Call Ben-Meir. Et tu, Graham? Oh. I'm sorry, sir. Ohh. I'm gonna be fine, sir. No, you're not fine. You're off duty as of now. No, no, no. Sir, please. Oh, I haven't missed a day's work in my life. You've gotta give me something to do. All right. There's a patient in Major Pedersen's office she got the worst of it, and I want to make sure that she keeps hydrated. Think you can handle that? Yes, sir. I can handle that. All right. Go. Something wrong with your pager there, doctor? No, sir. I'm sorry, sir. All right. Just help with the solutions. Yes, sir. All right. Where the hell is Dr. Hill?! I'll, uh, I'll get that. We're missing Dr. Hill! Oh, Rebecca, can you pass me a bottle of lytes? Uh, yeah. Sure thing. Let me hold it. You go. Uh, Suzy? Mm-hmm. You got a little... Oh. That explains the whistles. Oh. All right. Hello? Dr. Hill? He's not home. ♪ but in anger, not in fear ♪ ♪ for when your day is done ♪ ♪ oh ♪ Did I say, "come in"? Colonel Marks is looking for you. Yelling for you, actually. Are those what I think they are? Yes. Adorare italia. Vive les Francaises. And on that note, au revoir. But everyone is vomiting. They need help with cleanup. Look, it's below my pay grade, okay? So tell Colonel Marks I send my regrets, and I also have this bug that's buzzing around. And in the meantime, you can be my agent in absentia. Your what? I authorize you to speak on my behalf. I give you my power of attorney, so go. Good-bye. Good luck. Excuse me. Colonel Marks asked me to look in on you for a little while. Ohh. Ohh. Oh, it's you. Hey, you... you don't have to, if you don't... No, no, no. It's okay. I think I just threw up a French fry from 1988. Ohh. You got it, too? You know me and kebabs. Ohh. Ohh. Yeah. No, no, no. Don't. Don't do that. - Don't vomit. If you vomit, I will vomit. - Ohh. I'm good. Ohh. Are you gonna be okay with this? Sure. Come on. Not every day I get to spend puking... with my ex-husband. All right. Any other symptoms other than your stomach? I have a bad, bad headache. Uh, well, you know, bad headaches are not uncommon. You know what? How about... here we go. Can I get one of those, nurse? Drink one of these, uh, get some good rest, and you'll be great in about a day or two. - You're good. Come on. - What are you doing here? There we go. Oh, man. Just feeling a little out of sorts. Okay. Well, if your insides aren't flying out, then consider yourself a lucky man. I'm getting luckier by the second. Bobby, I can finish up here. All right, listen up! Choppers have landed. One bravo, two alphas. Which T.T.L.s are free? Uh, we're done here. All right. - I'll get bay 2 ready, sir. - Okay, good. - We'll take the bravo over there. - Yes, sir. All right? The alphas will have to wait, if need be. No solids for the next 24 hours, all right? - Yeah. - You'll be fine. - Ohh. - Hey. - Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Oh! Hey! Bobby, take him to I.C.U. Figure out what's wrong with him. Okay. All right. You've had T.T.L. experience, right? - Yes, sir. - Take bay 1. Colonel, thank you for calling me. You're the flight surgeon. We got a pilot coming in. Take bay 2. Yes, sir. All right. All right. I need five med techs. Come this way. Hang in there, son. Bravo. Bay 2! Okay, people, they're here! B.P. 70 over palp. Pulse 140.

Any history of anemia, dizzy spells, low blood pressure? No. It's like being sidelined in the play-offs, isn't it? What? Oh. No. No, man. Every, uh, every patient's a priority. Okay, any history of anemia, dizzy spells, low blood pressure? Ohh. Whoa. What are you doing? Where are you going? Your friends need you. Don't tie yourself up with a little indigestion. Indigestion's one thing, but fever and fainting... No, man. Just get back in bed. What? I'm fine. I'm... I feel better already. Look, I'm the diagnostician. I diagnose... which means I tell you when it's fine. You don't tell me, all right? Now get back in bed. Please? All right. That's right, man. I thought agony was strictly a defeat thing. Yeah, well, live and learn. (Exhales deeply You know, I think you might be a little more comfortable. If you took this uniform top off. I'm on duty. Ohh. You're not trying to get me naked, are you? Yes. You got me all figured out. Come here. Thanks. Yeah. What happened to, uh, Dr. Pedersen? I came looking for her earlier. Oh, she's at FOB Ireland doing psych evals. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, you got the hots for Dr. Pedersen, do you? What does Helen think about that? Don't go there, Graham. Anyway... We broke up two months ago. You broke up with her? And you didn't think to tell me? Why would I tell you? I think I'd want to know about you breaking up with the woman that you left me for. Why, so you could gloat? Hey. I just heard what happened. I was just talking to Ray. I mean, he was asking me about... Oh, my God. I think I did something wrong. Major Gordon. This is Colonel Axelquist. U.S. Air Force Board of Investigations. The colonel is setting up interviews with anyone who had any contact with Ray or his crew. Do you have a few minutes? This is a standard investigative procedure, major. We're just trying to get as complete a picture as possible on the events leading up to the crash. We have a few preliminary questions. Is this about the go pills? Uh, Ray... Excuse me... Uh, Captain Ludford, uh, caught me on the fly as he was leaving. He asked me for some stimulants, and I said no. Well, let me get this straight. Captain Ludford was fatigued, and he asked you for go pills, and you refused? May I remind you, colonel, that it's not Canadian policy to give fatigued pilots stimulants? Thank you, colonel. So Captain Ludford came to you exhausted? No, I didn't say he was exhausted. He was just kidding around, and I told him that if he really needed the pills, he needed to go to his flight surgeon. Did you follow up with the flight surgeon? No, I didn't. And did you report this to Colonel Marks? No. It was no big thing. Well, doctor, we have a dead pilot and a dead copilot and two injured parajumpers. I would say it was a big thing, wouldn't you? Colonel, may we have a moment? We'll resume this later. I'm not sure Major Gordon understands the situation, colonel. Maybe you can help her. Come on. What the hell was that about? He was just trying to do his job. Now the most common reason for a chopper to go down is pilot error, and what Axelquist is doing is asking you to try to help him figure out if that's the case. Now if you're unwilling to cooperate, there will be consequences for you, either for not reporting Ray to the flight surgeon and preventing him from flying. Or not giving him go pills. You're not this sick. Why aren't you this sick? Because I had one kebab. You had 23. Ooh. The dimenhydrinate should be kicking in right now. Okay. You okay? You hate me, don't you... for leaving you? You always get emotional when you're sick. Um... Tell me a... a story. One with a happy ending. Okay. Well... Well, once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess... and she was smart, athletic, great in bed. She was the fairest in the land... and she was loved by a young boy from the wrong side of the tracks. Don't tell me this story. This is a sad story. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful, big blue platypus. It was smart, athletic... fantastic in bed. Better than the princess. Mm. Princesses. Ohh. We were happy together, weren't we, until you started working all the time? What I mean... and it had nothing to do with the fact that you fell in love with someone else. Ohh. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Just got up a bit fast. Think I'm dehydrated. I'm sorry. I can see you're not a fan of sleep, but, uh, soap and water is everyone's friend. Forgive me for putting your health above my hygiene. Yes, take a shower. How's he doing? He's good. Hey, hey. It's okay. Ray? I'm sorry, T. Can I help you? Dr. Hill? Are they okay? Yeah, they will be. Yeah. Why, do you want to see them? Yes, but, Dr. Hill, there are two Afghan men waiting for you at the gate. They need to speak with you urgently something about your farm. My farm? What do you mean? I don't know, but they're angry. Uh, okay. Well, just find out what you can, all right? I'm sure your agent skills will come in handy. Okay. I'll be right back. Can you tell us what happened? He came in in a bad way. He had 50% burns on his body, and, uh, internal injuries. - Your friends lost someone, huh? - Yeah. Captain Ray Ludford. He was a friend of mine as well. Kind of. I-I didn't know him very long, but... You don't have to know someone long in this place. You know, sometimes a day... it's enough to form a deep, lasting bond. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry you're not feeling well. Well, so am I. I mean, you, me, and a bed? It's kind of a waste. You know, don't get me wrong. I'm glad I have an excuse to see you again. Just wish it was under better circumstances. Me, too. Graham. Graham. Graham. Yeah. You're snoring. Sorry. You need anything? Mm... Oh, I haven't felt like throwing up in over an hour. That's improvement. You're out of uniform. Off duty. Oh. You don't have to stay. Hey. Where are you going? I gotta pee. Ooh. Hang on. Hang on. Mm. Ohh. Mm. Mm. I... cannot be your rebound person. Graham, I don't... Let's get you to the bathroom. Okay. You're okay. I need to speak with Major Gordon. Dr. Gordon. Excuse me. I wanted to give our young men some time to rest before we chatted, but it appears they're awake. I just have a few questions. Okay. Gentlemen. How you holding up? Good. Did the captain seem incoherent or fatigued in any way? No. Not at all, sir. The engine. Yeah. The, uh... The engine felt off, sir. Uh, the flight safety team has yet to find any signs of mechanical failure. I know my copters and I know Ray. The engine was off. He wasn't. Well, come now, sergeant we both know human error r... Yeah, but you weren't there, okay? - You don't know what happened! - Hey! Hey, hey! Hey! Deep breaths. Deep breaths. Get out! Major, I can hardly be held responsible... That wasn't a request, colonel. There are a lot of eyes on this investigation, colonel, and they have a lot of questions, such as why Major Gordon failed to treat a clearly fatigued pilot according to protocol, for instance. I'll let you get back to work. Major Gordon... We'll speak again soon. Colonel. Uh, okay, okay. Okay, okay. What's going on? They say they care for the crops on your farm, but it seems they have come to a situation of disagreement. Listen, I-I haven't got time for this. I need you to sort this out. You mean be your agent? Yeah, like, uh... Yeah, like Jerry Maguire. I've seen the "Jerry Maguire" DVD. Three times. He makes money to be an agent... So much money, they show it to him. Okay, fine. Fine. Uh, just... Just name your price, okay? Hey. Hey. Hi. How are you doing? I'm gonna need those labs A.S.A.P., major. Yes, captain. Done. I'm back in five. Thank you. She likes you. Do you like her? You know, my dad told me once. That if you like a woman, you should tell her, and if you don't, well, you should tell her that, too. It's simple. Unless... You like another woman more. - There's no other woman. - No? No. I mean, who else? No. There's no one. Dr. Gordon? Rebecca? No, we're just friends, man. Well, if you say so. You haven't figured anything out yet, have you? Look, I'm telling you, we're just friends, all right? Just drop it. You haven't figured out what's wrong with me. Right. No. Not yet, but I will. You've been bested by a bug, doctor. It happens. Hmm. Thanks. Sip it slow. There's a bucket there, should the need arise. Where did you get a rose on base? I mean, in Kandahar? You know me. Yeah, I do. No urge to hurl. I think the worst has passed. Yep. You're back in uniform. Yep. I'm on duty in, um... three and a half minutes. Graham. Thank you. It wasn't so bad, was it... when we were married? No. We were good together. I still love you. Uh... I gotta go. Just a few more minutes. I... I can check back with you in an hour. Graham, wait. Ohh. Okay, go. See ya later. Hey, any news yet? Just waiting for the C.T. scan. Just, uh, checking in. So... Rebecca. Yes. Rebecca. Right. You two are kinda... We're just friends. Friends. Right. Ahem. No, man, I mean, you... you consumed a substantial amount of food this week maybe it is dietary after all. We've got dolma, mantu, kufta, shami, rice, rice, and more rice, maushuwa... That wasn't a week. That was a Friday. What can I say? I'm not a salad guy. Yeah, but even so, man, I mean, if you're eating like a linebacker and fainting like a debutante, nutrients are clearly not being absorbed. I don't think a scan is actually gonna tell us very much. You're gonna have to give me a sample, my friend. Not the kind that goes tinkle. All right, sergeant. If anything else occurs in the next few days, don't hesitate. - If you could, uh... - Yes? Tell me why I'm being asked to comment on this. Dismissed. Thank you for your time. "'Flying high in the skies, '. By Warren Wilder of 'The National Insight.'" Thanks, but I prefer "The Times." "While there can be no denying the overall effectiveness of Kandahar's role 3 hospital..." "Conflicting national policies on medical treatment of fatigued pilots can produce decidedly deadly results." Well, Mr. Wilder certainly has a particular perspececve. I wonder how he came to that. If you're making an accusation, colonel, let's make it quickly and clearly. When it comes to care in this hospital, it's not personal. It sure as hell isn't political. It's not about laying blame. It's about finding responsibility. Now can you have Major Gordon meet me here in 30 minutes? Hi. Hey. Well, congratulations. You are the proud father of a tapeworm. Well, at least it's the lesser of the possible medical evils. No, you don't understand. I-I don't even fish with worms, and I have one inside of me? I... I don't feel so g... Tough guy has a squeamish spot, huh? Oh, and the tough girl doesn't? Uh, look, it's okay. I understand if this all makes you uneasy. Mm. No, no. It's not... It's not you. It's just, um... I have a lot on my plate right now. With that colonel, that investigator? Listen, I've seen so many men like him. You know, they're just all full of bluster. It's not him I'm worried about. What if I made the wrong decision? If Ray was fatigued, maybe I should've given him the pills. Even the very best of us can only do our best, Rebecca. The only question you have to answer is, did you? You don't have to write it down. You can just tell me. You've gotta be kidding. Look, you are mediating a small dispute, okay? It's not world peace. I think that's a very fair fee. Fair to you, maybe. Okay. Okay. This is so stupid. Ohh. Okay. What do you want? I've always wanted a pair of Italian shoes. The pint-sized hustler's got me over a barrel with the whole "I can't speak Farsi" thing. I'm trying not to worm out of this man. Please don't use the "w" word. So the Suzy thing... Is it bad sex, good sex? Suzy? It might not just be Suzy. I'm glad to see you guys find my life so amusing. What? Look, I like Suzy, but I can't have her thinking that, uh, this is going somewhere that it's not. Ohh. You know, if Suzy thinks she's gonna find the fairy tale here, then she's deluding herself. Man, you gotta be honest with her, man. You can't string her along. It's cruel. Oh, we're all bastards on the inside. Although in your case, you're like a worm factory. You know, if the thought of that didn't make me nauauous, I'd kill you with this bowl. En guarde. I'd like to see that, actually. Okay, I'm gonna get you to roll up on your side and open your mouth, all right? Ohh. Wait a second. How does this work? Oh, it's actually pretty simple. You just lay in this position - and the tapeworm, attracted to the smell... - Oh, God. - and the warmth of the curdled milk... - Oh! will crawl up and out your open mouth. Then once it's in sight... Uh, what? It's gonna come up through... through... Whoa. I didn't expect him to pass out like that. Yeah, I thought he'd puke. - Nice. - Yeah. We'll start him on a run of praziquantel, and, uh, the worm should be dead in a day or two. We'll watch him until he's clear. I'm impressed, Dr. Trang. You know, letting your inner bastard shine. You here? I got a few minutes. We're back on the record. So are you familiar with studies on the safety and effectiveness of stimulant use. in extended flight operations? Only with those that you sent me this morning. And when you declined to give Captain Ludford the medication he requested, you were not familiar with these studies at the time, correct? Correct. Knowing what you know now, would your decision have been different? No. Even though these studies show that stimulant use under medical supervision is both safe and effective, and even though stimulants are routinely used to treat narcolepsy and A.D.H.D., even in children? Captain Ludford showed no signs of A.D.H.D. or narcolepsy. or of excessive fatigue, either, for that matter. Are, uh, stimulant drugs ever given to Canadian forces in flight operations? No. Not that I know of. Well, forgive me, major, I've been accused of playing politics in this investigation, but isn't it the worst kind of politics to deny our men and women whatever help they need to do their duty? I do not and will not prescribe such a serious psychostimulant with reckless abandon... without a physical, without a history, and without a damn good reason. Now if I had any reason to believe at all That Captain Ludford really needed such a drug, I would have done everything in my power to stop him from flying. And if you're wrong, major? If... If it proves that pilot fatigue played a role in the crash, then yes, that will be on my conscience. All I can say to you is that in my brief encounter with Captain Ludford, he showed no evidence of impairment, and my decision would be exactly the same. Thank you. The unused piece of land at the back of your farm... you know the one you promised to them both? Well, surprise, surprise. They both want it. Right. Explain to them that I made a mistake. I did. So... So? Look, you're wearing your payday. Go to it, Mr. Maguire. Dr. Hill... Consortium? (Speaks middle eastern dialect) Concert? Concert? Ohh. Okay? (Speaks middle eastern dialect) Mister. All right. Very good. Okay. Thanks, doctor. Bless you, doctor. What did you say to them? Neither will use the land themselves instead they'll rent it out and split the profits. Everybody's happy. So it's... it's done, yeah? Not quite. Now it's done. Hey. Look, uh... I just wanted to say I'm sorry I've been weird. You know, I had an amazing time the other day. I got a million things on my plate right now, you know, and... and maybe in a different place, a different time, it would be a different story, but right now, here, it just... I don't... I don't think this can go anywhere. You thought I wanted this to go somewhere? ( I'm fine with the fling thing. In fact, I'm feeling a little flingy right now. Oh. Mmm. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? That's nasty. What? - Hi, guys. - Hey. Hey. - How are you doing? - Good. Good. Hey, look, Suzy told us what you did back there. Thank you. No, I didn't do anything, T. They've cleared Captain Ray. Colonel, uh, sorry, but what does that mean? Was it human error, mechanical, medical, what? The pilot was cleared. That's all the man from Washington would say. That's not much of an apology. You take what you can get, Rebecca. ♪ Doctor... No, I know. I should've come to you about Ray. I know. All right. Oh, and for the record, I'm very proud of the way you handled yourself in there today, major.
