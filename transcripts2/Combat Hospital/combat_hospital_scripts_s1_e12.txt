 Combat Hospital (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 12 - Triage - full transcript 
 A deserted Russian bunker - Col. Marks and Structural Engineer Captain Fitzharold (Fitz) survey the site for a potential new clinic. But the clinic is not as safe as originally thought and they accidentally trigger an unexploded ordinance. Col. Marks finds himself with minor injuries, but Fitz has been impaled on a piece of rebar. Fitz and Col. Marks are rushed to the Role 3 where Major Rebecca Gordon has been in charge of triage in Col. Marks' absence. Because of a previous group of injured, their supplies are low, and the operation to save Fitz will use their last resources. It seems possible, until an ambushed Afghan family is brought to their Trauma Bay. Following the rules of combat triage, Rebecca has to choose - the family or Fitz -- who is to go to the O.R. and live and who has to wait, which means certain death. Bobby starts anger management treatment with Pedersen, even though he denies he has a problem. But babysitting Aref threatens Bobby's cool and he's forced to face a nasty truth.

How are we on blood? We're okay for right now... but he's a transient bleeder, So he's losing two to three units of blood an hour. He will need a blood infusion. He will also need a long surgical O.R. Time With an extensive medical team-- I'm really fine. What's going on down there? Rebecca's going over the game plan For Captain Fitzharold's surgery. Why didn't anybody tell me? Colonel. Sir. Sir, we're not finished. And due to the organ damage and sepsis, He probably has a 40% chance of surviving... such a lengthy O.R. We're not gonna let that stop us. And we're gonna do everything that we can... To keep him alive. Colonel. Colonel? We tried contacting r.C. South to see if we could transfer him, But because of the heavy ops going on, All the nato facilities are full from Major offensives On all fronts. Not to mention that he is probably too weak, And we don't have the blood supply. Look, Sir, we could have all surgeons on hand, okay? But his bowels, his liver, his- They're in a bad way. His metabolic state is very poor. Okay? So we're gonna Have to throw everything we have at him and some. That's exactly what we're gonna do. All hands on deck, folks. M-Max, Rebecca, Simon...
