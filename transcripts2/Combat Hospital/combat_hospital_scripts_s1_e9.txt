 Combat Hospital (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 9 - Shifting Sands - full transcript 
 The hospital is on alert when the injured detainee (Kamaal) accused of triggering an IED is brought in and Vans recognizes him as an old friend. Although Colonel Xavier Marks orders Vans from interacting with Kamaal, Vans seeks to learn the truth and is shocked when he finds out that the ANA soldier that shot Kamaal was another old friend of Vans, Salman. Vans is torn between loyalties. Kamaal says he's innocent, yet Salman says Kamaal is guilty. Who does he believe? When Kamaal escapes during a rocket attack, Vans himself is brought under suspicion by the Military Police, and there is little Colonel Marks can do to protect Vans. As the MPs search for the missing Kamaal, Dr. Simon Hill is called on to bring his unique talents to treat a curmudgeonly General who can't seem to stop crying.

Warrant officer marcus Xinico, military police. A suspected insurgent was transported here. I'd like to talk to him. Why don't you let us do our jobs here first?

Never... and I mean never... do that again. But I know him. He's a friend. That's my friend Bashier! We used to play together when we were kids. Look, I don't care if he's your long-lost cousin. You do not let a suspected insurgent see your face. Is that clear? Okakay. Ow go to bay 3. You're needed there. We got 'em all. Okay, we're good. Your interpreter knows the suspect, sir. I need to talk to him, pronto. What are you talking about? What are you doing to me? Guy in bay 2... he saw Vans' face. Bashier! They had a conversation. What are you doing? What are you doing to me? Be calm. Relax. Just relax. He is gonna have one sore ass tomorrow. All right, there's no structural damage, But we'll need to do exploratory surgery To excise the bullet before he gets an infection. Let's r.S.I. And prep him for O.R. Etomidate, fentanyl, sux. Did he see Vans? I had to remove his blindfold. He had a laceration. Vans poked his head in. He said he knew who he was. When you're out of surgery, I want to talk to both of you. Yes, sir. It's not your fault. Why do I feel like it is? It's not your fault. You know Kamaal? Yes, he's my friend, but I haven't seen him in a long time. Kamaal's not Taliban. No way. When was the last time you saw him? Two years. Is he going to be okay? You know anything about the company he keeps? Hangs out at madrassas, owns a lot of cell phones. I don't know. You don't know. What'd he say to you in there? He said my name... Bashier. He asked for my help. What kind of help? Just help. Help to escape? Help to get a message to someone maybe? Look, the kid was scared, he saw a friendly face. He may be a kid, colonel. That doesn't mean he's not a veteran. Look, I need Vans in there right now. He's got a job to do. Come on. Of course, colonel. Why is he asking me all this? You stay away from your friend. You got it? I will be liaising with major Samizay and the A.N.A. About this matter. Status? One AK-47 round officially removed from Taliban ted's ass. Major. He tolerated the surgery well, And we are keeping an eye on him, sir. Good. He'll be in the isolation room. I'll be posting my men there. Sir. Walking wounded from the I.E.D. Attack Just reached the front gate. All right. We'll be right there. Colonel. About Vans, I should have made sure He cleared the area before I removed the blindfold. Forget it. It wasn't your fault. So now, Vans talked to this guy? No, it was just a few words. Did he tell him anything? You're not thinking that he would help out a detainee? I'm not, but others might. So? No. No. As far as I could tell, theyeyere just saying hi. Yeah. Why? Do you think this guy's Taliban? Wouldn't bet against it. But in here, he's a patient first. All right? Back to work. Yes, sir. Got it. All right. Can I just get you to sign that? How many do you want me to sign? We'll need to debride this. Okay. Yeah, give him a tetanus I.S.G. And a booster. Yes, sir. All right. What was that about? He was afraid of the shot. I told him you'd be gentle, Just like his mother. What happened here? I hit dash when we went into ditch. Yeah. Were you unconscious at any point? For a few seconds, sir, yes. All right. Observation 48 hours. We can rule out a concussion. You'll need a couple stitches for that wound. All right? Yes, sir. Bashier. Salman? You're bleeding. Did you get shot? I toto bullet in the head, but hit nothing important. Colonel Marks, This is my good friend Salman. We're like brothers. I'm the good-looking one. Seems you've got a lot of friends coming in today. Why don't you take your friend inside? See that someone stitches up that wound. When did you join the afghan army? Uh, six month ago. What was that? He said you are pretty. N-no, I-I did not. I-I would not say that. So you're saying that I'm not, then? N-no, no, I... I-I-I mean, yes. Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay! Ach! Well, you are gonna have a nice, sexy scar for the ladies. There you go. All right, why don't you get some rest, okay? You hear that? A sexy scar. And a medal. I shot the guy who triggered the I.E.D. You did? Yes. If he lives, he will remember me every time he sits down. They took him here by helicopter. The guy you shot is Kamaal Sodaba. Kamaal? You must have made a mistake. But... but I saw him right after the explosion. He came out from behind so rocks near the side of the road. He... he was running, so I-I fired. Are you sure it's Kamaal? Yes, with a bullet wound in his butt. I swear, the guy I shot set off the I.E.D. Attention! Relax. You see? I told you they'd be busy, And they're busy. Let's get the hell out of here. We can wait, sir. Maybe you can, but I got places to go, people to see. With all due respect, sir, no, you don't. Are you giving me orders, sergeant major? Begging the general's pardon, but somebody has to. Can I help you, general? Thank you, colonel, but I can see you're busy. Oh, these are just the walking wounded. Everything's under control. How can we help you? My sergeant major has this idea I need to see a doctor, But I'm perfectly fine. Is something upsetting you, general? No, damn it. He's crying all the time, sir. I'm not crying. Then what's that? Should I fetch Dr. Pedersen, sir? No, let me... let me check it out first. Is something on yoyo mind? Something upsetting you... Do I look upset to you? I'll tell you who's upset, sir. Our men are upset. Okay. I admit my eyes water a little. Hold... ah! I just need to feel your eyelid. Just... Hold still. I don't like anything near my eyes. All right. Call Simon. Yes, sir. Hmm. Look, this really isn't a big deal. I'll tell you what is a big deal. In two days, We chopper into Helmand province to begin an offensive, And the guy giving orders has tears dripping down his cheeks. It lowers morale, and low morale costs lives. Hmm. Having a cell phone doesn't mean The boy's working with the Talibans. On its own, no. He also had an american $10 bill. $10? That's the going rate for planting I.E.D.s. We're running a check on the numbers Stored in his cell phone. We'll see what comes up. Ma'am. Private Salman Zawab, as you requested. Sir. We just have a few questions. Your commanding officer tells me you shot the suspect. Is that right? Yes. Can you tell me what you saw? Right after explosion, I was... I-I black out for a moment. Then I get out of the truck, I see him running away, and I fire. Why? Why would he run away if he did not do it? I understand you know the suspect, That you were friends. I didn't know it was Kamaal when I fired. Had you known, would you have fired? Do you have reason to believe he may be Taliban? I don't know. He seemed... Guilty. Sir. Thank you, soldier. You can go. You're still under observation for that head wound. All right? So get some bed rest. Thank you, sir. An I.E.D. Explosion can often precede a Taliban ambush. It's not surprising that anyone in the area would flee. I am aware of Taliban tactics, ma'am. Colonel Marks, I recommend that, given your terp's relationship To the suspect, he be relieved for the time being. I trust my staff, including Vans. Okay. You know your men. Aah! Excuse me. Aah! Aah-aah! Aah-aah! Aah! Aah! The eyedrops won't do any good if you keep closing your eyes. I know that. I'm not stupid. It's... it's... What is it called? Involuntary. Exactly. By your leave, sir? You have an idea that'll help? With the general's permission. Go ahead. Quick, doc. Aah-aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Come on. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Begging the general's pardon. Not at all, sergeant major. You did what needed to be done. What's going on? Sorry about the ruckus, colonel. I couldn't help myself. Don't worry, sir. Most people are very sensitive About anything around their eyes. All right. I'll leave you to it, then. General. Right, now listen to me. I'm going to have to Examine your eyes one way or another, okay? Don't pay any attention to me. Just do what you have to do. All right. Come on. Here we go. Stay very still. All right. Just admit it. You made a mistake. No. You were confused, okay? You fired. You do not know what I saw! I know it's Kamaal, our friend. You think just because we were friends when we were children, It does not mean he could have been tempted... He taught you how to swim! You don't think I know that? What is it? My head hurts. I need rest. General, you have, uh, two sets of tear ducts. Now one set produces tears to lubricate the eye. Uh, now yours are fine. Then you have the ducts which drain the tears Into the inside corner of the eye into the nasal cavity. Now those are blocked. All right? It's very common. I don't care how common it is. How do you fix it? It's a very delicate procedure, wherein a very thin Surgical probe is inserted into the corner of your eye, And then that carefully follows the twists and turns Of the tear duct until it finds the obstruction, and then... You okay? Go on. Right. Well, then the probe will... Push through. Now it's painful... it's very painful, actually... But the good news is, there's absolutely no need To do this now. Next time you're on leave, Or, you know, at your convenience... It's convenient right now. We don't have an ophthalmologist here, sir. It's pretty specialized stuff. You could get it done at Landstuhl. Colonel, could I talk to you privately for a moment? Ah, big brass talk. Okay, I'll be outside. All right. I didn't want to come here. My sergeant major dragged me, but he's right. I can't command people like this. Your people respect you. I can see that. You can always tell those who have earned the respect Of the people they command. My people make me look good. Then you'll understand what it's like to lose that... That hard-earned respect. Simon. Can you handle this? I'm a neurosurgeon. Yes, in theory, I can handle anything. Just do what you have to do And get me the hell back to work. He's gonna be okay. Just needs some rest. He'll be up soon. I need to check on the detainee. Is there a terp on duty? I can do it. No, you can't. He's already seen me. It doesn't matter now. You have to take it up with colonel Marks. He said it was okay, really. All right. Get the door. Corporal. Tell him it's okay, I'm a doctor. Bashier... Ask him how he's feeling. What did he say? It's a little sore. Where? That sounds like a lot of places to be sore. No, they don't. What's going on here? I told you to stay away from him. You know what this looks like? I had to know. Get out. Colonel, I just wanted to ask him. Out. Out. What the hell is taking so long? Since we don't have an ophthalmologist, general, We don't have the right tools. It needs to be thin, long, smooth stainless steel... which is why we thought of a cardiac needle. What's that? We blunted the tip. Just something to help you relax. I don't want it. Yeah, but what is that? An.18 gauge? It's a tear duct, for god's sake... No. It's too wide to penetrate the puncta. Not an open heart surgery. "it's too wide, it's too wide." it's too wide. Okay. All right, let me try it for size. Are you sure you don't want sedative general? I did tell you it's gonna be very painful. 100%. Let's get it done. All right. Here we go, then. Aah! Why'd you stop? Because you started yelling, general, And he didn't even touch you. Whatever I say or do, don't stop, you understand? You know, I think you're gonna be Much more comfortable in Landstuhl. I'm not leaving afghanistan for this. I'm here now. My head is in a damn vice. Let's do it. Okay. All right, here we go. Aah! I need you to open your eye. I'm trying. Open your eye. By your leave, sir. Right, good, good, good. Aah! Thank you. Aah! No. No, it's no good. Rebecca's right. It's not thin enough. Uh, well, uh, well, what about this one, guys? So now what do we do? Guide wire for a subclavian catheter. Yeah. Okay. Let's try that. Won't be long now, general. Or not. Seems the Taliban wants to delay your procedure, general. All right. Evacuate. Patients and nonessential personnel... Bunkers! I'm on it! What do we d do with the prisoner? He's well enough to move. Take him to the bunker. Uh, Jacob, help the M.P. All right, let's move! This way. I need you this way. Where you take me? I've done nothing. Where you take me? Go, quick. Let's go! All right, come on, I need him going this way. Take him out this side. Just lay back. All clear. Attack is over. Repeat... all clear. Attack is over. Repeat... all clear. I'm sorry, sir. Attack is over. I must have just been out for a few seconds, But when I came to, he was gone. Not your fault, soldier. Colonel. Yes, sir. I need to interview your staff, see if anybody saw anything. They'd report it if they did. Suspect wouldn't last two seconds here Without being spotted, unless he had help. I think it's time for us to be extra cautious. We need to alert the base. We need to round up Anybody who knows or may be friendly with the suspect, Including your interpreter. I can handle it. No exceptions, sir. I said I can handle it. Sir. ♪ What's it like in the army? Just like this, only we don't have ice cream and pizza. You have it good here, Bashier. I know. They treat me like I'm one of them. But you're not. They're them, and we're us. It's good to remember that. ♪ This is my favorite spot on the base. Really? This pole? Someday I'll visit all these places. You come, too. We can go backpacking. Backpacking? It's the way people travel in the west. We can backpack all over the world. Not me. I get enough backpacking in the army. No, when I get out of here, I'm going straight to the London school of economics. Then I'll come back here and start my own company. What kind of company? I don't know yet, but it will be big. What about you? ♪ I want to go to a rave In Manchester, England, where it all started. I want to see the pyramids at Giza And go to carnival in Rio. I want to go to the winter olympics in Vancouver.

All base employees have to report to d-fac. I.D. Alert seven charlie. What's going on? Detainee has escaped. You should get your ass down there. You got some place to be, be there. Now! Vans? R.S.M. Kelly. They say I have to go to the d-fac. Oh, no, no, no, no. Gotta report to colonel Marks right away. Let's go. You can't hold Vans for nothing, for saying hello. Well, a warrant officer can and will. Does he know this? Not yet. Graham's out looking for him right now. I have to go talk to my nephew. Xinico considers him a security risk. Wouldn't look good for either of you. Listst, I know this is hard, especially for you. No, for Vans especially. Up high. I'll need the inventory report by 1800 hours. Down low. I've already tried that. Now can we just get back to work? Mm. We'll get it done. You are killing me. Okay? You're killing me. Commander. Wanted to let you know We may have a possible lead on Aref's uncle. Oh, that's fantastic. As soon as we locate him, we'll bring him in. Uh, thank you. Thank you very much, major. No. No, no, no, no. Vans, come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Hey. Hear that? Your uncle's coming to pick you up. Huh? See, I got a little smiley face going on here. People do this, yoyoknow, to make them... Well, to make other people think that they're happy. Right? That they're okay. Let me show you here. Okay. Smile, brown eyes, And there. See? Little happy face here. You wanted to see me, colonel? Kamaal's escaped. Warrant officer Xinico thinks he might have had help. From who? From me? I didn't help him. I wouldn't do that. That's not what I'm saying. You don't trust me. While Kamaal's still at large, you are to be detained. Detained? Like Kamaal. You've put me in a difficult position. I said stay away from him. It wasn't just a suggestion. I'm gonna need your I.D. Badge. Vans. Now you go with him, and I'll do all that I can. Don't bother, sir. What's going on? Vans. Vans. ♪ Trust me, I feel much better. Thanks for the info, But I'm still gonna do my doctor routine. Where is Bashier... Hands like that. I mean Vans. Can't say. What do you mean? What has happened to him? They're suspicious of him, aren't they? Because he is friends with Kamaal. Let's give it overnight, all right? If your numbers are still good in the morning, I'm gonna declare you fit to rejoin your unit. They'll arrange for transport for you to get back. You been here all night? While the detainee is still loose, I don't think I can really sleep. That's a, uh, a 2-player game. Well, this way, half of me always wins. And half of you always loses. You want to talk about Vans? I don't, actually. Ah, you're having a party, nice. What is it? A menage needs a trois. You know that. What is it? You locked up Vans... Mm-hmm. Which I think is ridiculous, so I'm here to tell you That I think he's a bloody great chap, And you've made a bloody great error. Please, be more candid, Simon. Colonel. Are you in a meeting? No, it's no... It's a menage. Well, it was. May I speak freely, sir? By all means. You can't hold Vans like that, like he's the enemy. I mean, it's Vans we're talking about... Vans put himself in that position, And I'm dealing with the situation the best I can. Wow. I'd hate to see your worst. What's going on? Well, I'm trying to play backgammon, is what's going on. Colonel, I just wanted to say... No, hold on, let me guess. Vans is being treated Inhumanely, and how could I be doing that to Vans, right? Kind of. One of the privileges of rank is that You never have to justify your orders to those below you. And I am not gonna start now. Grace, you're welcome to stay. The rest of you are dismissed. Yes, sir. Don't forget your flak jacket, Simon. "don't forget your flak jacket, Simon." Thank you, colonel. I believe it is your move. All right, try to relax, general. How can I relax with this thing in my eye? Okay, I'm well into the canaliculus. And into the lacrimal sac? Mm-hmm. Okay. Now we need to bend 90 degrees. Okay, nearly there... Nearly there... d dn it. What? It's no good. Look, it's... Thin enough, it's long enough, but it's too stretchy. It won't make the bend down into the lacrimal sac. I don't know how much more of this I can take. The men are counting on you, sir. Too short. Too sharp. Too flimsy. A pen... seriously? We need something thin, stiff, smooth, with a blunt tip. Don't get any ideas, rebecca. How hard can this be? Apparently, impossible. I wish the old bastard had gone to Landstuhl. The old bastard is still here. Oh, I'm sorry, general. Sorry. There's got to be something. Excuse me, sir. I need your signature. And the A.N.A.'s here to collect Salman. All right. How about this? Yeah, this is good. Can you file the end so it's rounded? Yeah. I'll file and sterilize that in a minute and a half. Excuse me. You're gonna do a procedure on my eyes with a paper clip? Yes, sir, that's the idea. Okay. Just checking. Carry on. Excuse me, general. I'll be right back. Don't worry about Vans. We'll do everything we can. Thank you, sir. All right. Aah! It's okay. Aah! Aah! Aah! Nothing to worry about. Aah! Good luck, son. Thank you, sir. Salman. Do you think Kamaal triggered the I.E.D.? We got him, colonel. We found him in a shipping container. Somebody heard him moaning. Seems he's got some bad pain. Alert is canceled. Threat level zero. I repeat... alert is canceled. Okay. Get an o-2 and an I.V. Started immediately. Take him to trauma bay 2. Let me take a look at these wounds. He's lost a lot of blood. His wounds are infected. B.P.'s low... 90 over 50. Temp's 38 degrees. Gave two units o negeg. Getting a c.B.C., culture, and chem panel. All right. Clean, debride, and resuture. Yes, sir. O.R. 3! Copy that. Aah! Everything okay in here, Simon? One eye done, one to go. Good work. Colonel Marks. I want to take the detainee out of here as soon as he's stable. That's your prerogative. I want to question your interpreter again. I want You present. I think it'll intimidate him into the truth. He told you the truth. I have more questions. The insurgent's cell phone turn up anything? It was clean. So you're trying to link my interpreter to an already weak Case against your suspect. Now it doesn't make me happy That you probably have to release him, but I would ask At this point, you leave my interpreter out of it. Excuse me, colonel. It is now conclusive. The attack was on an A.N.A. Convoy. We have questions for the suspect as well. He's just taking up a bed here, colonel. I request, when he's medically stable, Transfer him to Kandahar general, And that warrant officer Xinico release him into our custody. That's fine with me, major. Warrant officer? You can send one of your men to interview him. All right, colonel, but in my report, I'll have to suggest you could have been more cooperative. Well, you report whatever you need to. All right. Let's get Vans back in here. We need him. Thank you, colonel. All right. We're gonna need the conference room On thursdays from 0800 to 1800, for... R.N. Traininin are you listening to me? 0800 t01800 for r.N. Training in the conference room. I'm booking it right now. You know, I think if you were duty nurse, A lot more would get done around here.

How could he do it? I'm sorry, Bashier. It's a war. They did what they had to do. Vans. Vans, stop. I know you're angry with me, son. I'm not your son. I did what I thought was the best thing. Now I know it didn't feel right, didn't feel good... You don't have to explain to me. You are my boss. You are With the coalition, and I'm just the afghan interpreter. Vans, that's not what I meant. Is that all, sir? Here you go. At least he's not our problem. Kandahar general can take it from here. Yeah. Hey. What are you doing here? I'm on duty. Good luck. So remember to use the decongestant For the next few weeks. It'll help keep the sinuses clear. Don't worry. I'll see that he does, Even if I have to do it myself. Thanks, doc. Your skill with a paper clip puts macgyver to shame. Colonel, your outfit reminds me of my own. You do a lot with a little. Glad to be of service, sir. I'm still gonna be able to turn on the waterworks And let loose when need be, right? Of course, general. Good, 'cause if there's anything I'd hate to lose during This war, that would be it. Sometimes all you can do is cry. Don't you quote me on that. So where's Aref? His uncle came to get him. You didn't think to come get me? No. Sorry. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just, uh...
