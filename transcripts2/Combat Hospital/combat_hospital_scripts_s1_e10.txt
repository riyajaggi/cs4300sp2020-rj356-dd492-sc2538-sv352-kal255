 Combat Hospital (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 10 - Reason to Believe - full transcript 
 When both Dr. Simon Hill and Chaplain Marjorie Plottel are called in to treat and comfort Sgt. Geoffry Daums, a severely injured patient, their worlds threaten to collapse. Simon is on the verge from dealing with guilt and anger over the past that haunts him. And Plottel has lost her faith. Daums, who has suffered a major spinal trauma and may be left quadriplegic, calls on Chaplain Plottel to help him grapple with his own faith. Simon, trying to redeem himself in his own eyes, petitions Col. Marks to allow him to do a risky surgery to help Daums regain use of his arms. Because she promised Daums she wouldn't leave him, Plottel finds herself in the O.R. as Simon tries to work his magic. A friendly repartee turns into deadly barbs as the surgeon and the Padre go toe to toe. As things heat up in the O.R., Majors Rebecca Gordon and Grace Pedersen have to respond quickly at the Women's Clinic when a young Afghan teacher brings in her young charges who have been poisoned and are near death.

 And God said to Abraham, "take your son, your only son. "Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains." God never asks for that which means little to us. Why does he do this? For what purpose? We ask this... Why us? Why this? And the answer is...

 and the answer is faith. It is a belief that God's plan... That his... We believe... I believe... We are reminded to have faith in our creator, to hold steadfast to our faith... Faith in him, faith in those around us, and f-faith... Faith in our lord, our God. Amen.

 There you are. Here I am. How'd the surgery go? As expected. Another Lord Hill masterpiece. Spinal injury inbound. E.T.A. now. You take this one. Sergeant Geoffrey Daums, sir. 27-year-old American soldier. He's an E.O.D. with the OMLT. Attempting to deactivate an I.E.D. When he was thrown by the explosive, sir. He's semialert and responsive. Neuro damage to the upper and lower limbs. I gotta go back. I have to go back. You're okay. You're okay, sergeant. This is where you want to be, okay? Possible concussion. Shrapnel to the face, lower limbs, and hands. Severe spinal injury. What's your name? Please. I left my... What's your name? He can't hear you. What's your name?! I gotta... my... my legs. I gotta... I gotta get my legs. I can't feel... Oh, jude... Please don't... oh, God. You're in one piece son. The chaplain get him inside. Why is this happening to me? Ready, team 4! Find the chaplain. Yes, sir. Trauma bay 2. B.P. is 140 over 90. Pulse is 130. Got one I.V. Ringers on board. G.C.S. is 9. Eyes 4, verbal 4, motor is 1. Okay, let's manage his airway. - Start him on 30 milligrams per kilogram... - My legs. of methylprednisolone, 100% O-2. I need a C.T. scan as well. X-rays, please... C-spine, A.P., and lateral. I want to rule out blast lung. The sergeant wants to talk to the chaplain. - Yes, sir. - Simon, you can start your neuro. Thought you'd never ask. Right. I want another set of vitals on him, please. Chaplain. Chaplain? Even better. I'm a neurosurgeon. The chaplain's on her way, son. Hang tight. Okay. B.P. 90 over 50. Pulse 50. Respirations 10. Right. Do you feel this? My legs. My legs. Soldier, do you feel this? No. No. All right. And this? Sergeant, , fe that? My legs. No response. Okay. All right. I want you to squeeze my hands. Squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. I-I am. He is. Okay. Loss of sympathetic tone. Going into spinal shock. You can fix me. You can fix me. You can fix me. Name is Sergeant Geoffrey Daums. He's in pretty bad shape. It was a a complete transection of the lumbar spine. We can stabilize that, but he won't have the use of his legs. Geoffrey. I'm chaplain Plottel. ...C-6 and 7 are crushed. Right. You think he's gonna be a quadriplegic? I know how difficult this is for you, how frightened you are. The X-ray itself, it won't show the damage to the spinal cord, so... Right. We need the C.T. Don't leave me. I am with you. I will be here as long as you need me. My... my wife... My baby... Okay, so you're saying he might have use of his upper limbs? Yeah, exactly. I mean, you know, I won't be easy, but I might be able to go in and decompress the spine... The doctors are doing everything they can. Why? Why me? God, please help me. "Have you not known? Have you not heard? "The Lord is the everlasting God, "the creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary." All right. We're gonna need that C.T. to assess. "To he who has no might, he gives strength." "Even youths will faint and strengthens the purpose"... - Doctors! - "Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted... " ...Not working. - "Those who wait for the lord..." - Intubate? - "Shall renew their strength..." - Yes. All right. "And shall mount up with wings like eagles." Etomidate, 20 milligrams per kilo, I.V. Over 30 to 60 seconds for compression, then followed by rocuronium. Geoffrey, I am right here with you. We're trying to save this kid's life, padre. His soul will have to wait. Thank you. Okay, move it. Move it. Okay, intubate. Okay, hold him. Hold him. Yeah. The spinal cord itself doesn't seem to be severed, which is good news, but it's being compressed by these bone fragments. You rang? Whew. This guy looks like he's in bad shape. Yeah. Tell me about it. Right. This is what we're gonna do. You see these annoying pieces of broken vertebrae pressing against his spinal cord? I want to remove them. Okay? I want to stabilize the spine and do a spine fusion. - A discectomy and bone graft? - Yeah. We've never done that kind of spinal surgery here. So we have to send him to Landstuhl. No. Look, by the time we've flown him to Germany, okay, there'll be too much damage to his spinal cord. He'll never be able to breathe... Mm-hmm. Without the use of a ventilator or use his hands again. It's too big a risk. This hospital's not equipped to handle a surgery that complex. I am. You've done this procedure before? He's right, sir. This can't wait till this guy gets to Germany. A delay guarantees he ends up a quadriplegic. Look, I can do this, okay? Just trust me. All right. I'm gonna get 'em to prep the O.R. It's a long one. You start in an hour. You will not regret this. Did you tell Simon about us? No. Why? You think he knows? If he knows, everyone does. There's something I wanted to run by you. I was, um, thinking of going back to school... Everyone here knows, don't they? I'm gonna get kicked outta here 'cause I let myself get distracted. - Distracted? - What? I swear, I don't think I have one button left you haven't pushed. You... can you just keep it down a little bit? Oh, my God! - That's not keeping it d... - Are you serious? You're afraid to be caught using a-a metaphor. - Dr. Trang. - Yo. Hey. Any chance I could talk to you? - Yes. - Yes, you certainly can. Give the matter some consideration, Dr. Trang. I'd be really interested in hearing what you're going to do next. What's going on, man? Um, well... You're in fantastic shape. Uh, it's hard not to notice. Thank you? Yeah, well, not that my girlfriend w-would like twice at you, you know. She prefers a heftier build. Just not this hefty. I've kind of put on a few pounds since I've been out here. What's a few pounds, buddy? 30... 5. 57. Nice. I-I know it's a lot to ask, a-and I don't want to take any time away from your lady friend... That's not an issue. Uh, so is that a yes, then? Hell, yeah, man. What kind of doctor would I be if I turned my back on a potential heart attack- stroke-diabetes victim? What? I'm not gonna lie. It's not gonna be easy. But nothing worthwhile ever is. So, okay. This is what we'll do. We'll start monitoring your caloric intake. We'll get you on a program and... Barrett. Barrett! Coming? Look, could we get on with this, please? Some of us have important phone calls to make... You know, doctor stuff, life and death, that kind of... Hold on a minute, honey. My little girl, who I haven't seen in 16 months, likes to have her daddy tell her what he had for lunch. You want to explain to me why this isn't an important call? That's what I thought. Ow! Oh, that's nice. Sorry. That's real nice. Ow! Go ahead. Laugh at my pain. That is really, really the kind of sensitivity you want to see from a shrink. Oh, what can I say? I'm not immune. Whew. You ever worn a burka? Uh, nope. Oddly enough, the occasion never arose. Oh, well, I have. I wanted to see what it was like. I must say, I didn't mind not being stared at for a day. Ah, the burden of being an attractive woman. Right. I gotta be honest. I'd rather be stared at than erased altogether. They're not being erased. They're busy... Raising families, teaching in schools, building their country, at great... at a great risk, I might add. Really? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry. So you're saying that she feels... liberated because she's not being seen as a sex symbol? I don't know. And... and answer me this... Why is it a woman's responsibility to control what goes through men's minds when they look at them? Okay. Are you even listening to me? Where these instruments are not sufficient, intervene by your holy spirit to prevent pain and hasten recovery. We ask this in the name of the Lord, the great physician. Amen. You're in God's hands now, Geoffrey. Actually, he's in my hands, which is lucky for him, but if you want to pray for the great physician... then here I am, Bible woman. And, Dr. Prakash, you're pretty good, too, aren't you? Thank you. It's an honor just to be nominated. As you know, my humble neurosurgeon isn't a believer. Oh, no. You're wrong, colonel. I'm very much a believer. I believe in one thing and one thing only, and that's myself, so if you'll excuse me, I need to get ready to perform a miracle. Mm-hmm. He's under more pressure than usual with this one. You up to staying in the O.R.? It'll be grueling... Eight, ten hours. I know. Mm. All right. ♪ ♪ ♪ tell her her daughter's doing well... but she needs to come back in about a week so that we can check her progress. It's not normal. What? The way you don't sweat. You know, that could be anhidrosis. You should get that checked out, really. I feel the heat just as much as you do. Really? Then why the hell don't you show it? (Woman) Help! Help us! Please! Help us! Please help us! We are dying! Come on, darling. When did this happen? 30, m-maybe 40 minutes ago. These girls are students in my school. Samira was first. She began to vomit, and soon, the others couldn't breathe. Let's get them inside. Okay. Okay, come here. Oh, my God. You're okay. I think they've been poisoned. We all ate the same thing, but before she got sick, Samira said she smelled something sweet. Organophosphates? Wait. Were... were they all vomiting? - Yes. - Okay, then you're right. It must be organophosphate poisoning. Step away from the girls. They're toxic. Okay, it penetrates through latex, so wash your hands now. The poison is in their clothes and it's seeping into their skin, so we need to wash them down very carefully so that we don't contaminate ourselves, and I want you to radio the hospital. Tell them that we're bringing in four patients who have been exposed to organophosphate. Okay. You're not in surgery? You want to tell me what's going on? You know, I don't think I need to explain to you that... confession is good for the soul. When I first came here, I was... so sure of my purpose... So... I mean, you think Simon's arrogant? I was like, "valley of the shadow of death? Bring it on." I thought I had all the answers. But then I've seen people go through things, day after day... Horrific, unimaginable things. And they come to me for comfort, and what do I tell them? Have faith in God's plan. I don't. I can't do this anymore. The words mean nothing to me. So... So I just wanted to give you a heads-up that... That's it, Xavier. I'm done. I see. All right, then. Marjorie. There's a young man in the O.R., and I believe you made a promise to him. I can't. I told you, I can't. No, it's not an order. It's a request... That you do at the very least what I would expect of my chaplain, and that is get yourself back into that O.R. And you be there... For Daums until he gets on the plane for Germany. Okay, so you'll all have a bad headache for about a day or so, but hopefully, with no complications. Are you feeling okay, Leila? Mm-hmm. You know how this happened? The Taliban. First, our library... And now this. You're looking really pale. Wanna come with me? They've been poisoning girls schools across the country, trying to scare off parents who are terrified that giving their daughters an education will put them in danger. The girls and I... we will survive, but... it took years to collect those books. Padre, there you are. I was wondering where you were. I thought you had decided to stand me up. Of course, I should've known better. Hemostat. Women do tend to find me irresistible. Isn't that right, Pam? Absolutely, doctor. Trembles at the very sight of me, this one. Mm. You, however, are the rare type of women who appear to enjoy me solely for my mind. Come on. Come and take a closer look. It's your chance to finally see an honest to goodness miracle. Isn't that why you're here? I'm here because I made a promise to Sergeant Daubs. Ah. So you're here out of obligation and guilt, unlike me, who does this for love. Well, and lots and lots of money. Simon. It's all right, Dr. Prakash Dr. Hill's antipathy toward my role here is nothing new. Yeah, and if you don't join me in a vigorous game of faith versus reason, I'll begin to think you share it. I'm really not in the mood for a debate, Dr. Hill. Oh, is that so? Or have you finally begun to realize the futility in believing what you know isn't true? All right. I'll start. Kierkegaard? Or a little bit of Nietzsche? How about "a casual walk "through the lunatic asylum will show you that faith does not prove anything"? What wisdom can we draw from a man who declared God dead and then went insane? Ah, so you do want to play. What I want is for you to treat Sergeant Daums with the dignity he deserves. Is that some sort of joke? That's something you couldn't possibly comprehend, doctor. Not everything is. You know, padre, I don't think I want you in here anymore. - And I don’t answer to you, doctor. - Oh, you want a higher authority? Well, in this room, I'm as good as it gets, so get the hell out... Vitals are 90 over 60. Pulse 50. He's deteriorating. Did he rupture a blood vessel? I don't know. Let's get some suction. Blood pressure's still dropping. Could you have punctured the dura? No, let's get him some vasopressors. You've gotta hold on, Geoffrey. You know that God is with you, strengthening you. Let your faith in him see you through this. Wow. Is that really the best you can do, padre? - Can I have a clamp, please? - He's going South. No, he's not. There's no excessive bleeding. He's just hypotensive. Get another unit of blood. All is well, children. All is well. It was some, uh, vasodilation. Pressors sorted it out, and everything is right as rain. That was close. As always, I had everything completely under control, ladies and gentlemen. "What a piece of work is man. How noble in reason." Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. We made a deal, man. You start quoting Shakespeare... I get to, you know, sing a song from my homeland. Well, don't get too excited, everyone. He's from Indianapolis. Allow me to be the first to contribute. Thanks, Graham. Whoa. "Moreta, Dragonlady of Pern"? I believe the expression is "don't knock it till you've tried it." Great idea. Hey, thanks. Bobby, you want to grab some lunch? Can't. I'm, uh, meeting up with Barrett. Who? The Vickerdale guy. I'm helping him get in shape for his wedding. So you want me to walk out of here thinking you'd rather spend time with the Vickerdale guy than me. That's not really in my control. You don't break up with girls, do you? You get them to do your dirty work for you. I'm right, aren't I? You make yourself so frustrating to be with that they have no choice but to dump you, regardless of how damn hot you are. All right, fine. Consider yourself dumped, whether you want to be or not. Suzy. Suzy. It's been fun. Like, seriously mind-blowing fun. It's just not worth the risk. Tell me that six months from now. - Sir. - Yo. I just got off the phone with a man claiming to be Dr. Hill's brother. Ah. Simon has a family. And here I thought he'd sprung from the head of Zeus. I think you're referring to the goddess Athena, sir. Yes, and I believe that was my attempt at a bit of humor. If you say so, sir. Anyway, this gentleman's called many times before, and his manner has always been the same. He's extremely agitated, he's ranting, uh, very difficult to understand. And Dr. Hill has always responded with a marked lack of interest. Well, that's his prerogative. Yes, sir, but this time it's different. This gentleman has threatened to hurt himself if Dr. hill doesn't return the call. All right. Thanks. You were right. These bone grafts are making me weep at their beauty. This is amazing. Yes, I am. For a change, I'm gonna have to agree with you. Padre, are you willing to risk hearing Dr. Prakash sing? I'd love to hear some Shakespeare. How about... "I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth." Sorry to interrupt, doctors. That's all right, colonel. As I predicted, things have gone extremely well. TOC got an urgent call for you a while ago. Did she have a sexy Swedish accent? Actually, the person claimed to be your brother. Colonel, um... You've been the victim of a prank. I have a medical school friend. He... He's notorious for this kind of thing, so it's nothing to worry about. I apologize on his behalf. Now you tell your friend to prank someone else, 'cause my people have better things to do with their time than to sit and listen to someone joke about suicide. Is that clear? Yes. Understood, colonel. Hey. How are you feeling? - Better. - Good. I want you to come check in the clinic tomorrow so we can run another blood test, but you're gonna be just fine. Thank you. That's not all. Hold on. This is the beginning of your new library. Dr. Gordon, th... It's too much. No. No. It's the least we can do. A-and it's just the beginning. ) Padre. Look, if, um... I was a bit tough on you in there... What you did for Sergeant Daums was beyond extraordinary. You hold such power in those hands. You really do make a difference. I hope you never forget how fortunate you are. Yeah, well, if I do, you can remind me next time we're in surgery. There's not gonna be a next time. I understand the surgery was a great success. Dr. Hill was inspiring. His belief in himself... It's a gift. You don't seriously believe it's that simple, do you? Protocol requires you write a letter stating we've spoken and you agree with my decision. But I don't. I'm buried in paperwork. Give me till morning. Fine. I'll see you then. Hey. You're probably wondering where I am. But I can't tell you that. I can't tell anyone. They were bugging my room, so I had to leave. You should've visited me when you could. Now you can't. And now I'm not even getting the checks you send. All that money... I bet that makes you really mad. But will it make you call me? Maybe I'll call you. No. No, they're probably listening in on the phone, so, no, maybe I won't. That's why you won't call me, right? You don't want 'em hearing us. Yeah. That's clever, very, very, clever. But I want to talk to you, Simon. I want you to come home. ♪ Come on, Barrett. You're doing great, man. Let's go. I can't do it. I don't speak failure, buddy. Let's go. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Oh. You're the doctor of evil. Less talk, less talk. More walk. More run. Let's go... The Psychiatric Department, please. Lift those knees! Come on, Barrett. Let's go. We just started, pal. Dr. Alicia Blake. What do you... what do you mean, she's on leave? Since when? Well, what about her patients? Uh, Edward. Edward Hill. Edward Hill. Yeah. What? Well, who... who signed the release form? No, if he was competent, he wouldn't be there in the first place. Right. Do... do you at least have a forwarding address? No, I'm s... Yeah, I'm still here. Hold on. Um... Okay, if he calls by, okay... No, I said if he... Yeah, well, for the record, he does have a next of kin. Yes, he does. Right. N... Yes, I kn... no. Listen to me. No, listen to me, okay? If anything happens to him, okay... If... if... if he hurts himself in any way, then it's on you. Yeah, it's on you. Do you understand? You wanted to see me, sir? This is Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Winacott... field operations with the symic team. Now he works directly with the Afghans. Wants to have a chat with you. Of course. Thank you, colonel. Do you realize what you've done? What? You donated this to that school I irawanay, along with other books. No, I did, but that's... It... Do you have any idea how many cups of tea I have had to drink with the elders in this area to get them to trust us, to cooperate with our patrols, to report suspicious activities? And then you pull something like this. Obviously, I was... I was just trying to help. - I didn't... - You were trying to help? By supporting Taliban propaganda that we're here to corrupt their women, wipe out their culture, impose our will? It will take months and more money, more tea than it is humanly possible to drink to get their trust back. I'm sorry, but I was just trying to do something for those girls. Next time, you make damn sure before you involve yourself in something like that. You go through the proper channels. Or better yet, don't let there be a next time. Colonel. Oh, and by the way, major... They officially closed the school. Colonel. You're gonna be all right. I just feel sorry for the elders that have to have tea with him again. Good morning, sergeant. Well, I'm pleased to tell you that the operation went very well. And with the right... Rehabilitation and time, of course... I'm confident that you'll have the use of your arms. Why didn't you let me die, doctor? What's that? Why didn't you let me die? Look, I-I don't think you understand. Given the extent of your injuries, maintaining the use of your arms, that's... I mean, it's remarkable. I've got a baby girl that... I haven't seen yet. Look, you're gonna be able to hold her in your arms, okay? That... that's something, right? And what else am I gonna be able to do for her, doctor? Huh? What else am I going to be able to do for my wife? Well, look, I, um... Okay. All right, um, I can... see that this is a lot to take on board so when you're ready, we can talk again. Okay? You should've let me die. Colonel. Before you ask, Marjorie, I'm afraid I haven't gotten to your letter yet. - As soon as you can, please. - Right. Have you seen Sergeant Daums? He's in bad shape. Not yet, but I will. Sooner rather than later, I hope. How's Sergeant Daums doing? His spine is stable and his vitals are improving. He's not exactly thrilled about it, though. You know, I gave him the chance to hold his daughter, and... The ungrateful bastard tells me I should've let him die. So do you care? I thought you just did this for yourself. Yeah, maybe I do. At least I fix people, don't I? I mean, what do you do... except pretend to listen to people's pathetic personal dramas? I don't pretend to listen, Simon. When I'm called upon to listen, I'm there. Really? When people are frightened, when they're confused, when the last thing in the world they want is to be alone... I'm there. And you really believe that, do you? - Yes, I do. - And- and that's your... That's your big contribution is it, being there? Yes. Well, try being there for my suicidal brother. Tell me what you're gonna do about that... That your presence will help more than my money, because you know what? If that's what's gonna cure him, if that's what's... gonna get him out of my life, then I'm all for it. I'm sorry for you, Simon. You're hurting and you need help. Spare me. Do you know what? How dare you pity me? No, you have no right to pity me. I pity you for your utter uselessness. Major. Major! Hey! Can you take those off? Major, can you take 'em off? Thank you. We're leaving for the women's clinic. You have patients to see. Leila's expecting you. Can't you get someone else to do it? Really? So that's how you're gonna handle this? Just not show up? Sweet. Great. I'll be in the truck. We're leaving in five. ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey. Hey. You gotta be kidding me. What are you doing? Hey. Sorry, doc. I just couldn't do it. What about your girlfriend? Well, I figured that she said yes to me, and I look like this, so why change what ain't broke, right? It's not funny. It's not. Look, doc, I was miserable. I-I'd rather die happy, with a full stomach than die miserable and hungry. But, Barrett, we can do this, man. I know we can do this. Come on. Work with me here. It's pretty important to you, huh? Yes, it is. Well, maybe it's a little too important. Like, if there's one thing I've learned living in this hellhole, it's that life is short. Sometimes you just gotta stop and smell the pizza. Yeah, well, that's the problem. You're not just smelling it. You're eating the whole thing with the rest of the buffet. Come on, man. Think about this. I'm not letting this go. I'm watching y y. I don't care what you think. I'm gonna be the most annoying guy on base for you. How are you feeling, Geoffrey? I've been told you stand an excellent chance of regaining the use of your arms. That's wonderful news. Would you like me to read from the Bible? Forget the Bible. (Engines rumbling You know, there are really only two prayers we can offer to God. One is "thank you," the other is "help." Honestly, Geoffrey... I don't know why you got hurt... Why there is suffering, doubt. I wish I did. I've been trained to trust in God, that he has a plan or a reason. But I can find no reason for this. If there's no reason, what are we supposed to do? Jesus had his doubts... Mother Teresa and King David. It was a part of their spiritual path. They felt stripped of their connection to God, and you know what they did? They chose to believe. Would you do that with me, Geoffrey? Just choose to believe. What if it doesn't work? Then what? I don't know. But I won't leave you until you're ready. Thank you. ♪ so there's no headaches, vomiting? A bracelet? One last breath. Good. A beautiful gift. I am so sorry for what I did. You offered d books, and I took them. Well, and now, the school? In time, we will reopen the school. The fear will pass, and the parents will want their girls to learn because they wanted them to have a better future. This is for you. It's Sufi poetry by Rumi. He was born in this country a very long time ago. These poems are very beautiful, but... - They are in Pashto... - Oh. so you will have to study. Thank you. I understand nothing. Now you're getting the hang of it. "The wound is a place where the light enters you." Read it. All right. Who's next? Aah! There's still time to change your mind. Thank you, colonel.
