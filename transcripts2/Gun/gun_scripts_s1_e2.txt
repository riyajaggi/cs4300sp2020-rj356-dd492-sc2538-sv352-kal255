 Every day you do this here. Give me the eggs. No, no, no. You take them back he's liable to do something worse. That's ridiculous. I'll eat the eggs for God's sake. What are you doing here, Virge? What do you mean? What are you doing here? You hate his eggs. Go home. Come on, Ginny. It's a lousy driveby. Hell, it wasn't even a driveby.

 Some drunk shooting his gun in the air on New Year's Eve and the slug came down and beaned somebody on top of the head. You know I want to get married, but you can't expect me to go out on something like that. You don't want to go out at all, and I don't want you to go out in a body bag. Just one more case. Just one more. What's going to happen to me? Nothing is going to happen to me. All right, honey. No more cases. I'll tell them I'm through when I go in this morning, all right? I'll ride out the rest of the month behind the desk. You have my word. Okay? I'm afraid I have to go. I'm sorry, love. No, I got it. But this is for you, okay? I love you kid. I'll call you later. You're a great sport. Hey, Norm, what have we got? Homicide, Asian male, 40's, single head wound close range residue on right sleeve. Looks like he saw it coming, huh? Possibly, yeah. Tried to deflect the shot. Did you find a weapon? No, but we found a casing over here, a .45 semi. Who found the body? Officer. Officer. Yes, the witness was a jogger. He running by here. He runs by here every morning. Any ID? No. No wallet. No change No jewelry. No watch. Tan lines on his wrist and left ring finger. Probably married. Can I talk to you a second? Yeah. Sounds like robbery. What's the matter? He was facing the ocean. It's a nice view. So what? So if he was robbed, the shooter would have had to come from the front and turn him around. He wouldn't have been facing the ocean. The entrance wound's in the front, right? It doesn't make any sense, and where the hell would the shooter stand anyway? There's not enough room back there. Nah, this was an execution. An executioner wouldn't leave a casing. Would he leave a cigarette butt? Virgil, what do you want to make this so difficult for? It's just a robbery. Let's just call it that and go home. You can go out on an easy one. I had an easy one. What you had was a stupid one, okay? Look, you do not want to go out on an unsolved. That's going to be even worse. Guys, look what we found a couple blocks way. No credit cards, no cash. Left the license. Ichiho. Japanese. Yeah, we also found a picture. Oh, young, pretty Caucasian. That's a wife. Mistress. Thanks. Oh, Virge. You're going to torch me on this one aren't you? Spread out across this town with a series of numbers each and every possible combination. We buy them all, every combination. Thousand dollars a venue. Twenty thousand a man. Compute it. Tabulate it. Worked it over with a fine tooth comb gentlemen. The best computer minds I know, and each time you know what happens? It comes up a winner. You may ask why has no one ever thought of this before? It's a valid question. But this is an idea worthy of a Milken or a Boesky. So why has no one ever tried it? My response no one ever tried flight before the Wright Brothers, radio before DeForest and Armstrong, pc's before Wozniak and Jobs. This is our Kitty Hawk, our superheterdyne, our Macintosh, our unforgiving minute that we must fill with 60 seconds worth of distance run. Then ours is the world and everything that's on it. Carpe Diem, gentlemen. Seize the day or in our case the California Lottery. Thank you very much. Hey, what do you want kids? So it's kids now, huh? I'm not looking for trouble or nothing. How much money did you make today? You know a couple dollars. We work for the IRS. We need to take a look. Okay. Sure. Help yourself. Come on. Yeah. Crazy son of a bitch. Let's get out of here. Psycho. Hello. Can I help you? Yes, I'm Detective Guinness. My partner, Detective Vasso, LAPD. Is this the home of Mr. Tetsuo Ichiho? Yes, it is. And you are? I am his wife. Is something wrong? Do you mind if we come in for a minute? I need to get that. Sure. Hello. Wait, no, no, no. That's exciting. That is exciting. It's wonderful news, but there are two policemen here right now. Uh huh. No, I don't know why. I can't right now. Right. Right. All right. So is this something about Tetsuo? I'm afraid so ma'am. Your husband's body was found this morning in the Palisades. Oh, God. I'm very sorry. Oh, my God. It seems to have been a robbery. I just spoke to him last night. He was so happy. Are you sure? Are you sure it was him? Yes, ma'am. We need you to make a positive ID. Oh! Oh! How did it happen? Just not quite sure how it happened yet, ma'am. Oh. Could you tell me if you were separated from your husband? No. No. And when was the last time you saw him, ma'am? Am I not allowed to grieve for God sakes? We ask you Lord to bless this grave. Give our brother peace and rest, and on the day of judgement raise him up to eternal life until mighty God has called our brother from this life to himself we commit his body to the earth in which it was made. Lord receive you into paradise and take you to himself and give you peace for all eternity. Mrs. Ichiho, excuse me. I'm sorry to finally meet you like this. I'm Clayton Lutz. Your husband's business attorney. Tetsuo was a fine man. He'll be missed by everyone. Well thank you. It's good of you to come. Is it usual for the cop to come to something like this? A friend of mine is here. Oh, really? What's he do? She doesn't do anything anymore. I guess it's inevitable. We all end up the same way. Just a matter of time. So Detective, any luck finding who killed my husband? We're talking to some people anyone who might have seen something or heard the shot. And? Nothing so far but don't worry. We won't give up until we find him or her. But you said it was a robbery. I never said that. But... My partner said that. He's young. He'll learn. They might have done it. They've hated him ever since he left that bitch for me. They don't take too kindly to one of their boys marrying an outsider, gaijin, they call us. You know your husband was out for a walk at six o'clock in the morning. Does that sound right to you? What do you mean? I mean is that the kind of guy he was just go for a walk on the beach at sunrise? Who knows? Tetsuo was a very hard worker. I think he was too busy for sunrises. Maybe there's a lesson in that Detective. So what's the old Guinness itch tell you? She do it? You know the stages of grief you're supposed to go through? Anger, denial, bargaining. Yeah. Depression and acceptance. Yeah. Well, I think she took the express train to acceptance. Wooh. I'll call you back. Oh, what a nice surprise. Ooh, I love the bite of Dijon in the morning. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. I guess this answers the appropriately grave question as to whether or not you're all right? Uh, yes. I'm okay. How long are you supposed to grieve for any way? Anything less than 48 hours is generally considered callous. From 48 hours to 30 days is just tasteless. Thirty days! What about in New Orleans or India? I've seen where they have marching bands and they dress in white. Well, they're actually celebrating something quite different from what you are, Diane. Clay, this isn't going to affect the lottery is it? I hope not although it couldn't have possibly come at a worse time for me. What do you mean? I was going through your husband's estate and I found a recent addition to his insurance. A policy on his life for a million dollars. What? Or in the case of accidental death which this is, two million dollars. Oh, my God. Where does it say that? Let me see. Where does it say that? There. There it is. Two, two million. Aah! Aah! Clay. What honey? What? What? It was you. Me? Diane. No. You're the one who said you wish he'd just drop dead. Oh, no, Clay. That was just a figure of speech. I didn't mean you should actually do it. Diane, it was you. Me? Knowing how money is so much more important to you than sex. Oh, well that all depends on who you're making it with Clay. And Clay... ...I want to make it with you. Okay, I'm just trying to survive. Hey, hold on man. Don't shoot. You've been following me for the last 4 blocks. Don't you remember me? No, I don't remember you. It's Pete, baby, and Chester. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So what do you want? I want to show you something. Whatever you got I don't need. You was always looking for guns. Not anymore. Cheap. Hundred bucks. Found it. Yeah, and Ogee's a priest. No, I swear to God. Hey, I'm no thief. Found her in some bushes along PCH. I'm no lying either. You're a boy scout. I'll give you fifty bucks for it. Fifty bucks? It's a hot gun. You don't know that. I'm not going to pay anybody more than 50 bucks for a hot gun right? All right. No dogs allowed here. This is a great idea. I could just leave her a note and then call her up after work. Virgil, you can't leave her a note. Here she comes. What's he doing here? Look I'm really sorry honey. It just came my way before I could tell them I was through. It's true. I was there. Shut up. And you can't refuse it you understand because there's something about cracking your last case or it stays with you for the rest of your life. Yeah, you walk away from that and it's really bad luck. Which is precisely why I got to see it through. You understand that? You know, so that when you and I get married I'll be really free and clear. You know Venatter and Lang? You think those guys are enjoying their retirement? Get real. They were miserable. You don't think they replay that last case over and over again Yeah, night and day. We shoulda, woulda, coulda, if only, what if, etc., etc., etc.. Not pretty. No. You're a damn liar, Virge. Okay. That's okay. I don't think your sister believed me. You know, after studying the human mind for almost 30 years there was one question that Freud left unanswered. Yeah, what's that? What the hell does a woman want? I'm very sorry for your trouble. Appreciate your coming down. Afraid I have an ulcer. Your ex-husband had an ulcer. Did you know that? Is there any bad blood between the two of them? My mother says that if you looked at American wife, you'll find who killed the Japanese husband. Why did she say that? All she ever wanted from him was money. Then his money ran out. When did the money run out? After she spent it. Was he still paying alimony? Sounds like a lot of people were spending it. You know? Unfortunately, older men leave their wives for younger women in our culture. It happens a lot. Maybe your mother didn't like the new wife because your father did. Thank you. She says she see you do not believe her. We're going now to talk to his attorney. I'm terribly sorry, ma'am. I meant no offense. Sayonara. That looks like it went well. Yes, we need the money and the people by Tuesday. Put it into operation on Wednesday. You got that? Good. I got to go so just get it taken care of, Martin. All right? Sorry. I can't hear you. Just get a rundown and map of every venue we plan to hit. Bye. When are we going to get back into your office? As soon as I start doing legal work that's legal again. Well, sweetheart, I talked to the insurance company and I won't be able to get the money for at least four weeks. That's that 30 days I was telling you about. Yeah, I don't want to wait 30 days. I want in on the lottery. Diane, it's in two days so you'll never get the policy to pay off that soon. You could get it for me couldn't you? No bank works that fast. I'm not talking about a bank. I'm talking about your connections. Are you crazy? You know they charge 20 percent interest a month. Do you know how much money that is? No, no, no sweetheart. Hey. Hey. No, no, no. It wouldn't take a month. We win the lottery on Wednesday. Okay? I borrow from the bank against the proceeds to pay your people off. Takes about a week, 5 percent. Then I buy a third of the numbers and I'm in for $13 million dollars. Please. Oh, please, please please, baby. Come on. Please do it for me. Please, Clay? I didn't know you were so facile with numbers. Oh, baby. It's what attracted me to you in the first place. You are a planner, dreamer, a winner. You are the biggest winner I know. You're such a big, big winner. Oh, baby. I want to drown in your winnings. Oh, baby. Come on. Do it for me. Do it for me. Do it. Do it. Do it. Please. $52 million dollars, gentlemen. 36 hours away. Everything is progressing like clockwork. Now I want to go through the logistics again so that everyone is comfortable. Tomorrow at 10 AM you will come back here with the cash you have pledged. You will be assigned a buyer who will be responsible for allotment of tickets. If you wish to accompany your buyer... You may. After that, the only thing left to do is to go home and plan what you're going to do with your winnings. Any questions? What's he doing out here at six o'clock in the morning? There's got to be a reason. Uh, no cable TV? What's out there? The guy dumps his wife for a looker. At six o'clock in the morning when he should be home with the looker, he's out here looking out there. What's out there? Japan. Japan. David five Adam, are you by? This is SRC for David five Adam. Go ahead. Yeah, we ran a check with ATS and found a .45 semiautomatic registered to one Diane Ichiho, 45 Holyoak Terrace, Pacific Palisades. Copy that. A .45 semiautomatic registered to one Diane Ichiho. Unbelievable. Don't even start. Yeah. Yeah, I know it's a lot of money to move. That's why I called you. I figure if anybody could swing it it's got to be you, right? 20 percent, yeah. That's what I figured. Right. Okay. I'll bring the policy by in 30 minutes. Right. All right. Thank you my friend. Ah. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. I haven't felt this alive since... I can't remember when. You don't know how happy you've made me. I think I'm just about to find out. Yes. Yes. Yes. Who is it? Hello. Ah, Detectives what do I owe for the nice surprise? Sorry to bother you again. Do you mind if we come in? Sure. Sure. Of course, sir. Detectives, would you like some coffee, drinks? No ma'am just a few... We've just got a few questions and we'll be on our way. Detectives, this is Clatyon Lutz, my husband's attorney, family attorney really. Hello. Hi. Clayton was just going through some of my husband's things. Of course. Well, I guess I'll be going. I've got all the papers I need, Diane, and I'll be reading through them tonight. Just a minute, Mr. Lutz. I never thought I'd hear myself say this to a lawyer, but you're welcome to stay if you like. Oh, I'm not a criminal lawyer, Detective. That is I'm not saying I'm not a criminal who's a lawyer. What I'm saying is I just don't see how I can, my practice is in estate and corporate law. I'm the Ichiho's estate handler and I handle all of their business for the family so I guess I'll just let myself out. Excuse me. Bye Bye, Mr. Lutz. Bye Bye, and Diane? Yes. Bye Bye. So Detectives look. Is something wrong? Am I a suspect? Afraid we're all suspects until we find the killer. Isn't that right, Detective Vasso? That's what they say. Even I'm a suspect except I have no motive and my service revolver doesn't match the murder weapon. Oh, so you found the murder weapon? We've identified the type of weapon it was from the slug that killed your husband. It was a .45 semiautomatic 15 round officer's model. Perhaps you'd like to have a look at these pictures, ma'am. Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmmm. Oh. You recognize that model? Well, yes. He gave it to me after the wedding for protection. Any idea where he kept it ma'am? Nowhere in the house. I hated it. But maybe in his office or in a safe deposit box. Diane, where were you at 6 AM on the morning of the 3rd? Detective, I was asleep. I know that's not much of an alibi, but that's where most people are at 6 AM. She's doing him. Check him out tomorrow. You want to place your bet on the shooter? 3 to 1 on the lawyer. I thought he was going to hyperventilate before he hit the door. Yeah, well, except in your scenario which I'm not saying I do, if I had to pick one of them, I'd pick her. You don't exactly go for a sunrise walk in the park with your lawyer. Wish we had that damn gun. That's pretty. It's nice. Pretty little thing, huh? Is it hot? Cold as ice. I'll tune it. I'll give you a hundred dollars for it. I've got a dealer who's going to give me $400 for it right now. Yeah? Go do that then. All right. All right. All right. Give me a hundred bucks. Hold on a second will you? Yeah, yeah yeah, Lakers by ten. I'm going to put you down for a hundred then. Listen, on Tuesday at five o'clock all right? Aaah. Let's get out of here man. Did you tell them we were sleeping together? No, they don't know anything Clay. Know anything? We didn't do anything. Not illegal. Well, not yet, but do you know how bad this looks? Your gun, your lover, his attorney, his insurance policy, $2 million dollars and no alibi. Wait, wait wait. You're my alibi. Look. No see. That's not an alibi. That's a conspiracy. Okay. All right. It's not a conspiracy because I didn't do anything. Wait, I didn't do anything either, Clay. Okay. All right. That's all right. Just got to keep our eyes on the prize, the lottery. Got to keep them off the lottery. I'm going to get an ulcer. Thank you, Jesus. Since when did you get religion? I didn't. That was Jesus Perez at SPRS. Ichiho had a $1 million dollar life insurance policy. So what Lutz is doing her. That doesn't mean that they tapped him. I mean there's nothing suspicious here. There's no illegal activity. You know all of his clients are Asian. They're either Japanese, Chinese. His father was like a commodities broker from the Far East. So? So there's nothing suspicious here. All right. Never mind. Guinness here. You paged? Yo, what's up? All right. Thanks kid. We're on our way. Shooting last night in Venice. Ballistics match our murder weapon. Thank you Jesus. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Ladies and gentlemen, D-day has arrived. Could you? Thank you. Our operation in San Francisco is in full swing as we speak. Drivers, the phone in your van has a number on the handset that's specific to you. From now on you will be referred to by that number. Excuse me. Because you are the financiers and they are the captains of their ships. Tonight we will be three times as wealthy as we are right now. Excuse me. Diane, what's going on? I just want to make sure I get my favorite number. There are six numbers on a ticket and there are 14 million numbers. Oh, Clay look. Don't talk to me like that. I put $2 million dollars into this thing. I am your biggest investor times five. I think I deserve just one little number. It's okay, Mr. Lutz. I have the series that she's looking for. Oh. Fine. What is this almighty lucky number? It's 5,10, 15, 20, 25 and 30. That's ridiculous. A lottery number doesn't sound like that. Well, what does it sound like? Well, they end in ones and sixes and threes. Numbers like that never in multiples of five. Clay. Actually Mr. Lutz, this debate as possible as any of the others. Well, that's great. That's super. Take the number and lots of luck, and let's go. Time to go everybody. Go. Okay drivers this is it. Remember to obey all traffic laws. Any citations you receive will be your responsibility. Let's go guys. Let's go. We're on a schedule here. Let's move it. All right gentlemen, pitch and toss. All right, buyers, you will be identified by your phone number. Even numbered phones check in every hour on the half. Let's move. Let's move. Odd number phones check in every hour on the hour. Let's go. Let's go. Move it guys. Move it. I'm the luckiest man alive. The guy was standing right a couple of feet from me. He shoots me point blank. Goes right through my shoulders. What was it about, Red? What's it ever about? Well, it's usually about women, but that's unlikely in your case. Hey, hey, hey, that's funny man, but do you know I'm kind of good with the ladies. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I'm sure you are. Now why did this guy shoot you, Red? It was a hold-up. What do you think? I think I'm looking at a guy who's three weeks late on checking in with his probation officer and where we found traces of cocaine in his drawer where he works. I also think I'm looking at a guy who's going to be going back to Chino if he doesn't give us something good and quick. Listen, I told you I don't know anything. I was minding my own business. Now listen, fella, the gun that was used to shoot you was used to kill a guy in the Palisades the other day. No kidding? No kidding. Now wait a minute now because I think things are coming to me now. Oh, I'm sure they are. Let's have them. I want my probation lifted. I want a clean parole. You're going to have to give up a murderer for that Red. I could do that. Say again. You heard me. I could do that. Let's hear it. Homeless guy with a little white dog. That is some description. Beats a homeless guy without a little white dog. Let's talk to this guy. Excuse me, sir. LAPD. Listen to me. Don't be frightened. We're looking for a homeless man with a receding hairline and a little white dog. Can you help us out? Oh, forget it. Let's go down here. Hold on. Yeah. That's right. See you. Mr. Lutz? Yes. We haven't received any tickets yet from the 30 series. The 30 series? Yeah, I believe that's car number 20. 30 series? Who's on it? That's the van Mrs. Ichiho is in. Oh, God. Oh, God, Diane. It's going to his estate. Hello. Diane, where are you? Oh, sweetheart, sweetheart, I made a little detour. Detour? Are you out of you mind? The whole deal could hinge on your numbers. What are you doing? I did something a little wild. I bought a car just like yours. Diane, you've got to buy those tickets. Buy the car tomorrow. No, no, no, no, no. I already did. I already did. I'm driving it, but sweetheart we've got time. I divided the money and the tickets with Wayne. Wayne? Who's Wayne? Wayne, the driver. The CPA you sent me with. Diane, if you screw this up, I will personally kill you. Okay. Okay. Okay. I thought you'd be happy. I'll do it right now. God you are giving me the biggest headache. Me? This guy's dangerous. I don't know why people won't cooperate. Well, he probably spread all his wealth amongst his friends. Yeah, a regular Robin Hood, huh? Do you want something? Uh, yeah. How you want it? Sugar and cream? Actually, you know, no I don't I drink any more java I'm going to be running like Carl Lewis. You sure? I'm positive. Because you ain't getting any of mine all right? Yeah. Let's get out of here. What? Just be cool. Do you see what I see? I do. I think it's our man. Follow me. Hey, wait a second. Hey! Police. Now wait a second fella. Come back here. Police. Police. Stop. Police. Holy Mother. Don't move. Don't hurt me. You're under arrest for suspicion of murder. I didn't do nothing. What are you running from? Don't hurt the dog. Turn around, put the dog down and put your hands in the air. Turn around. I didn't think it was illegal or nothing, man. You didn't think withholding evidence of a murder from the police was illegal? Who are you kidding? I'm just trying to score a few extra bucks. You know how it is. Just trying to survive, man. Yeah, right there see? That string. It was tied right around, what's the part of a gun where you twirl it around your fingers? The trigger guard? That's it. I'd prefer it if you didn't call me man. Crap, bro. Like I say, I'm just trying to score a few extra bucks to feed the dog. Son of a bitch. Aah, ooh, I love it. Start the car. Come on. Get going man. It won't start man. What's wrong man? Come on, dude. Give me your gun. What? Are you going to shoot somebody? I'll shoot you if you don't give it to me. Hammer. Give me the brick. Now hold this right there just like that. Like that. Don't move. That's good. Forget it. Just leave it. No, no. Get away. No, no don't. Oh, no. My money. Aah, oh. No my numbers. No. No. Oh, no. My numbers. My numbers. No! Aaah! Bang. I think our homicide is a suicide. I'll be. That's why he was facing the ocean. It was the only sure way to get rid of the gun. Why did he fake a robbery? Money. He wanted it for his wife. But suicide nullifies an insurance policy. You shoot yourself there's no payoff. Poor guy. He thought he was doing something honorable. Now nobody gets a nickel. What a waste. Wow, the things some guys will do for their women. Yeah, tell me about it. I got one more question for you though. Who's going to get my gun? Now here are tonight's super lotto numbers for a whopping $56 million dollars, and that will make some lucky winner a very happy person, and these numbers are weird tonight; 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Again, tonight's jackpot $56 million dollars. Noooo! Yeehaw!
