It's a homicide, homicide, homicide-- Have you ever been in trouble with the cops before? My hands! I need, I just, I need to wash... I need to wash my hands. You ever been here before, in this police station? No. You sure about that? I stole some money, okay? That's-that's as, that's as far as my crime life... goes. Who'd you steal from? My parents, okay? It's why they made the house, you know, crime-proof. Hey. When was the last time you used drugs? What day is it? Thursday. It... It's Thursday. Tuesday. Tuesday, I took a couple of hits off-off a joint. I did. And since then, no speed, no smack, PCP...? No, I told you, I told you, okay? I told you I went to rehab and I fixed that. But... I've listened to everything you've said to me. And I'm gonna be completely honest with you, Eric. You're full of shit. Hey! Hey, Officer? Says he saw her through the living room window. Didn't have a key, so he pulled it and climbed in. You cleared the house? Yeah. After the paramedics, he went after us hard. We had to restrain him. Partner says he's been mumbling about some group of strung-out hippies. What, like some kind of Manson thing? The kid's dusted, maybe coked up. Walk me through the scene. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, let me out! Let me out, I'm-I'm calm now. I'm calm now! I'm calm! I'm very fucking calm now! Show me where you walked, and anything you touched. Body was here-- feet and head. Kid said he pulled the knives out himself to help her breathe. You didn't step in any blood? No. Nothing broken? Nothing tossed, no signs of ransacking? Just the purse? That's right. We got this over here. Locked when you cleared the house? Yes, sir. Somebody really likes peacocks. Put some light on that? Only forced entry. Everything else, untouched. Just the open front door. Other doors are locked. And one set of footprints. His. The neighbor said the mom and the kid fought like cats and dogs. I told her you'd need a full statement. So, what's it look like at the hospital, partner? Doc says she's not gonna make it. Dying declaration?Possibly. If she regains consciousness. Blunt force trauma. Probable C.O.D. This is a self-solver-- screwed-up kid, drugs. Her car keys are in his bedroom. Knock-down drag-outs, she said, until she kicked him out. Murder weapon? Take your pick. It's... Baseball trophy-- his-- kitchen knives, his fucking workout bar. Lots of firepower. Maybe he had help. Rage. It's a crime of passion, it's personal. I had a felony battery with him a couple months ago. And he got off on a he said/she said VRP. The reject. I'm gonna put him in the box. You're taking lead? Have ourselves a frank, man-to-piece-of-shit discussion about exactly what he did to her. That sounds like a yes. You're gonna get the cop-out? Yeah, before fucking dinner. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.Am I under arrest? Well, you should be. You understand these rights? Yes.And you choose to give up these rights? Yeah, well, if I don't, you're gonna f-fucking lock me up! Just tell the truth. Be that much closer to soap and water. Okay, you want to talk? You want to talk? Okay, go. Go! Is that a yes? Yes. Ask your fucking questions! What kind of burglar breaks into a house to steal 150 bucks, and then bothers to lock the doors? How can I fucking know that? If I looked through that window and I saw my mother lying on the floor, I'd get in there pretty damn fast. And that's what I did. No. No. You pulled the louvers from the window, and you stacked them neatly. You don't know my mother, okay? She can get real angry. And the pliers. You ran back to get them from your car? Yes. Yes. I needed them to pull the fucking louvers. But the only footprints I found were headed in? I don't know! Look harder, man! I did, I ran out! Then why weren't there any footprints headed back out the other way?I don't know! Jesus, man! What, do you really think I would do that? Like, kill my own mother? She took care of me. Yeah. She gave me money. She gave me groceries. Why weren't you living with her? My parents thought it would be better if I had my own place for a while. You had a room. A nice room at your parents'. So, let's talk about that room. Why didn't you search it? Because my mom never goes in there. You were looking for an intruder. Why didn't you look there? I don't know, man! I just, I didn't! So why do you say your mom never goes in there? Because it's myroom. Then how did her car keys end up on your desk? They didn't. What are you talking about? No, they didn't-- you're lying! How did they get there?They're not. They can't be. Why don't we trade places for a minute here? So if you were me, how would you handle this? I would, I would feel, I would feel bad for you. And I would, I would show it. Yeah, you're right, just somebody telling you nothing but bullshit over and over and over? I'd be a lot fucking nicer than you. Okay? I wouldn't try to trick you. I wouldn't try to force you into saying that you killed your own fucking mother. Okay, then how the fuck did her car keys end up in your room? Look at me! For your own sake, just tell me what happened. I swear to God, I'll help you out. Come on, what the fuck, James? He was there. His father's here, wants to see him. He's a juvenile. We got to let him know his father's here. I'll talk to him. The father. What's that gonna get you?Insurance. If I don't get the cop-out now, the dad gives me another bite at the apple. Polygraph. Yeah, but we can't ask him. He's got to volunteer. His daddy's gonna think it's a good idea. If he hasn't given it up yet, he's not gonna. 'Cause you don't think he did it? Everyone thinks he did it. Here we go.But that's not the job. If you don't get the cop-out, it's circumstantial. We got to put a case together, do the work. I know that he killed her. And he knows that he killed her. Then let him sweat it. Soak in it, come back out with me, help me work the scene. He needs to get this off his chest now. I can feel it. All right, you got a cigarette? No, I do not. 'Cause you quit? You don't got one on you? Go fuck yourself. How did I know that? It's 'cause I could feel it. Sure I can't get you anything-- cup of coffee, Coke, water? Wh-Where's my son, Detective? The thing is, I've been talking to Eric for, for a while now. Yeah, well, I need to see him. There are some serious conflicts in his story. What, you think he had something to do with this? Well, my partner, Connor, he's the senior guy. So, he's settled on Eric as the primary. Well, he's wrong! Your partner's wrong. Then I need to give him reason to know that. Sooner we clear Eric, the sooner we'll be able to start looking someplace else, all right? You could use some help with that, help me help your son. I need to verify a couple things he told me. If he tells the truth, even a piece of it, we can prove it... He's in here? I'm a father. I got a son. I hate to think a boy could do something like that, so... So, we clear him, I'm gonna sleep a lot better tonight. Mr. Fisher? What? We can't ask Eric to take the poly. It's got to be his idea. You understand? Can I? Yep. I'm done with you, asshole. Eric? Dad? My God, Dad. How is, how is, how is she? No. No, no, no! No, no, no, no! How does this even happen? I don't... How does this happen? How does this even fucking happen?! How does this fucking happen? And I'm here and I'm stuck in this fucking room! This cop! And the things he's been saying to me? You got, you got, you got to help, you got to help me. I will, I will. Of course, I'm gonna help you, Eric. But y-you've, you've got to help yourself, too, son. I know, I know I... I disappointed both of you, okay? But you got to know I would never... I would never fucking do this, I wouldn't do...Well, then... y- you tell him. Okay? You-you tell him what happened. Just tell him everything you remember. Just tell him the truth.That's what I've been doing! He doesn't fucking believe me. He treats me like some piece of shit that killed his mother for fucking grocery money! He doesn't fucking listen to me. Well, then... then you're gonna have to make him listen.Well, how the... If I killed her for the money, if I killed her for the money, then where is it? Where is it? Where's the fucking money? Where's the fucking money! Where is it!? Well, then you're gonna have to ask him that. Ask what? Okay? He won't even let me wash my hands. God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I know, I know, it's just... Eric, sit down. Sit, just sit down, okay? Just listen, listen. Breathe. Breathe. Listen, I-I... He knows you're upset, okay? I mean, you... you've seen a terrible thing. This... this... You've seen the worst thing possible. And you're probably not thinking straight right now. Right? Um... Eric, I think, um... I- I think the best thing is that you, you ask him for a polygraph test. Fucking... lie detector test? Yeah.That's crazy. Well... My God. You don't believe me. A fucking lie detector? Dad, that's... that's... that's... that's for you. It's not for me, Eric. It's-it's for you. It's fucking for you!It's... it's so you can prove... No! It's for you. You fucking... You think I fucking did this. You think I crushed her skull...Just stop. you think I tied a cord around her neck...Stop it. Eric. and you think I choked her. Just stop it. I would never...Stop it! I would never hurt her! I would never! Why don't you know that? Don't. He's good. Yeah, I'm better. Time's up, Lieutenant. I'm gonna finish him. Sorry I yelled. It's okay. Let me tell you what I think happened out there. I think you would yell, too, if somebody accused you. - Your mother... ...went out shopping this morning. That's warm. Then don't drink it. So you get there before she gets home, break in through the kitchen window. Maybe you're gonna steal some cash... No, I wasn't. Okay? I found her. I tried to save her. You done? So you two don't get along, and you're not supposed to be there, You don't know.but you are. You don't. And when she comes home and finds you in your room, I think she gets pretty fuckin' pissed off.Just... relax... man, okay? You're talking about my mom. That's right, the woman who changed the locks and nailed the windows shut because she doesn't trust you. Christ, she doesn't want you in her home. You don't know.I think that she starts the fight. She puts down her keys, and she says some fucked-up shit to you. Eric, Eric...Stop. Just pl... Stop.I don't blame you Just stop. Just stop.If she's attacking you, you've got to defend yourself. But with what? The trophy, it's right there sitting on your shelf. Right there on your shelf. Yeah. Now, you don't want to hurt her. You just want her to stop, but she...That's not true! but she keeps coming. That's not true.So you grab the... the workout bar, and you smack her in the head with it. No! That's not true! Right? No! No, I didn't!Hey, sit down. Sit the fuck down! Now she's running for the kitchen, the knives, and you're scared she's gonna get there first, but she doesn't-- you do. And you grab a couple, and you tell her to back off. It didn't happen. Now, you're just defending yourself. And now she's down. You don't know what to do. So you make it look like a robbery. You take the money and you call it in. How's that sound to you so far? It sounds pretty, pretty fucked up. So where'd you hide it? That is a lie. That is a lie.Hey. Hey. Hey, look at me. The 150 bucks, where'd you hide it? Eric? You tell the truth, and you got a shot at no jail time.I am telling you the truth, okay? I'm being extremely fucking truthful. How do I know that? Okay. Um, um, um... I'm done. Just one true thing. One checkable fact. Come on, kid. Hey. Just a piece of the truth, that's all I need. And all I need is a fucking lawyer. Either book me... or let me go. All right, stand up. Stand up. You fuckin'... Put your hands in your front pockets and keep them there. I need my dad. Where's my dad? All right. Same as the others?It's hard to say. Got to look at the pictures. If you're looking for Henry or Mary Fisher, leave a message and we'll call you back. If you're looking for Eric, this machine no longer accepts messages on his behalf. No answer? It makes no sense. I kill her... and then I call for help? Hey. I'm 17! You can't keep me here! I told the truth! Hey! Look, I can... I can prove it! Fuckin' test me, man! Wire me up! Ask me whatever you want! A polygraph! I want one! I'll make the call. Set it up. They booked him, right? He's a juvenile, Hank. They had to. It's the only way to hold him. Aw, shit. They haven't filed charges yet. Hank, we need to get you out of here. Come on. God, at the hospital... Just the way she looked. Eric couldn't have done that to her. Well, a polygraph will prove it. I mean, come on, what kid kills his mother for $150? I don't know.And I give him money whenever he asks. And-and besides, Eric didn't have the money on him. So where is it? That's good. You know, whoever did this took that money. If Eric doesn't have it, and it's not at the house... well, that... that clears him. When's the last time you ate? Let me get some food in you. No, I-I'm gonna go home. No, don't. Not tonight. You could stay at our place. No, no, that's... that's all right. Hank, come on. I'll catch you later. Mr. Fisher? I need you to look at the wall. So, pick a spot, and just keep your eyes right there. Mr. Fisher, did you hit your mother with that trophy? No. Did you stab your mother? No. Did you kill your mother? No. Did you hit your mother with that exercise bar? No. Are you lying to me now regarding what happened to your mother? No. Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Is it... Wait, how... How'd I do? Failed five out of five. It's the highest level of deception I've ever seen. How do you want to play it? You take him first. Go hard. No answer? I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so, so sorry. I don't think the team's prospects for this upcoming season... I told the truth, man, okay? I did. I swear to God. No, you didn't. The guy didn't have to hit me. ...that a World Series winner didn't make it to the playoffs. You rigged the test! All right? You rigged it! ...a real good team, and Tommy Lasorda knows what he's doing. You're gonna like this place. It's full of liars. You'll be their king. Fisher, Eric Henry. Juvenile 187.
