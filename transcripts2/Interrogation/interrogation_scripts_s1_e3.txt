He bought me this one on Eric's first birthday. But that... is worth more than all of them put together. 30 days sober.

 That's hard work. You changed your life, and you helped Eric change his. You need to try this one on. No. No, I'm still wet. I'll wreck it.Don't be silly. Minks live in water. Okay. Wearing one makes you feel like you should be wearing one.- If I were a nicer person, I'd give you that. So... things are good? With Eric? Kim, honey. I'm not asking you to give up state secrets. It's just... ...he said he's been sober before. We all have, Mrs. Fisher. Lying's part of the disease. You're right. I'm sorry to put you on the spot. I guess I'm just... used to worrying about him. He's doing great. He's doing more than great. And for the record, he's real fuckin' sober. Look, we have to get back in an hour. I'll be in my room. She's not as bad as you said. Sports hero. Not just sports. Stop. She's right down the hall.Who cares? Who cares? You like the way I kiss? I love... ...the way you kiss. What else? You know what else. What else? I need you. I do. But right now, babe... we got to go. But you didn't have any real lunch. Sobriety first, Mary. Thank you, Mrs. Fisher. We had a really great time. I'd like to report an assault. Did you hear me? McFeeble in personnel, please. Yes, I will hold... Hey, I got some Adam Henry busting my balls. A kid, some assault beef...I gotta go door-knock a subpoena. I got this one. Put him in Interview 1. Thanks, Russ. Decker. Kimberly Decker. D- E-C- K- E-R. Um... Black hair. She's 16, I think. Shorter than me. Thick glasses. Time of the assault? Thursday... 9:15, she pushes through my door with her brother Kevin. Took you a while to come in. Yeah. They cracked my rib. So... Her brother's got brown hair, um, s... Six-foot, built, Marine. You know, he-he came at me, like, hard. And while I was defending myself, Kim comes up behind me, she smashes me over the head with a fucking beer bottle, knocks me out cold. I mean, you can feel it. I'll take your word for it. Anyway, I come to, and there's nobody there. Any witnesses? No. And this attack came out of nowhere? Look, I barely know her, man. Okay. I have everything I need. Check this out. What is he looking at? So, if you barely knew her... Hey. How did you know it was her older brother Kevin? Um, I met him once. Thanks, E. Yeah? Where? Pacific Tides House. He would... he would, pick her up sometimes. It's a drug rehab in, Santa Monica. Looks like her brother was motivated. Yeah. He's her... he's her brother, man. A Marine. So, in my experience, they generally need a good reason. Come on. They're fucking order takers. I served in the Marines. Cool, man. I... You know, no disrespect. So did... so did... so did my dad. I just... I just mean, you know, you guys have, like, a... you know, Marines have, like, a... sense of duty. And first-class bullshit detectors. So, this attack... Hey. It didn't happen out of nowhere. Fine. Um, I saw her freebasing a couple weeks ago, and I told her counselor. I didn't want to narc her out. I was just... I was just trying to help her. They kicked her out of the program, and... her dad came down really hard on her. Okay. I'll look into it. Move. What'd you tell him?Just... Come on. Move. Relax. I kept you out of it. It's payback time, Chris. They're gonna lock up Kim and her asshole brother. Afternoon. Detective Dave Russell, Van Nuys Police Department. I'd like to ask you a few questions with regard to an assault on Eric Fisher. Unbelievable. I- I've never freebased cocaine in my life. Knocking people out with a beer bottle is aggravated assault. A beer bottle? He grabbed me, wouldn't let go. I hit him with his own fucking bong, and... ...and I didn't knock him out. He ran away. That's when Chris jumped into it. Chris. I thought your brother's name was Kevin. Chris is Eric's roommate. I don't know his last name. Kevin and I split when Chris started swinging a wrench. I'm gonna need to talk to Kevin. Good luck. He's, on his way back to Grenada to guard fucking sheep. I just... went there to get my stuff back. So, you two were together-- you and Fisher. Sounds like a rough breakup. And you brought your brother with you to get your stuff, your Marine brother. It's okay. If something happened between the two of you before... It's... My parents are gonna be... home any second. So you two met at rehab? Pacific Tides House? It's the one true thing he told you. I don't want to. Look at your dad and say it. I... I can't. It's easy, Kim-- six words. "When I see you, I feel..." When I see you, I feel like dying! You okay? They send you to get me? Nope. I sent myself. To give you a nice... friendly Eric hug. Here. And to say that when I see you, I think that your dad must be a real dick. Want to get out of here? I can't. My dad will freak. So will mine. I love this car. It's a '66? Really? 1966. That's the year I was born. Really?- Well, that's a sign. So I get it. He had a car. No. He got me. Um... He understood. You're not crazy. Your dad doesn't know what he's talking about. It's not his fault, though. I mean, when I was younger, I saw things. Things that weren't real. How do you know? Because they just... because they couldn't be. You feel like you live... in a different world, and that nobody... sees things the way that you do. You got to trust yourself to know what's real... for you. That is not how my dad sees it. Yeah, well, that's his problem. And you know that. I got to deal with this assault complaint. I need a... a little help here. He picked me up from school every day, and then... it was back to his apartment. Every day. School, his apartment. Yeah, I should have seen the signs. In the end, I couldn't stand how he looked, how he smelled. Kim? Kim? Kim? I got a problem here. If you don't tell me what happened, No, that can't happen.I have no choice. It only happened once. A couple of months ago. My parents can't know I told you. No. Okay. You got something to tell me? How do you like your steak? Are you cheating on me? What? What? Kim, no. Come on. Then how the fuck did I get herpes? It's a... That's a good question. How did you get herpes? Who the fuck have you been with? Nice try. You think I don't know about you and Melanie? Chris's girlfriend? Fucking please. We're finished. Wait.Don't... touch me. Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.Don't motherfucking touch me! I said I'm fucking sorry! Open the door! Open the fucking door! I hate you. Shut up! I'm sorry. I know you didn't cheat on me. I- I do. Thank you. That means a lot to me. What the hell's going on here? Detective Dave Russell, LAPD. You can't talk to her alone. She's 16 years old. Come with me, honey. It's all right. It's all right. We're fine. Well, I'm checking on an assault complaint for an Eric Fisher. She has nothing to do with that punk. You want to press charges? It's been handled, Detective. The Fisher kid's father and I-- we worked it out. You worked it out?GINA: Kim, honey? My daughter has serious problems.KIM: Leave me alone! Sounds to me like the Fisher kid assaulted your daughter. And what-- you let his dad pay you off?GINA: Kim? My daughter's delusional, Detective. She sees and hears things that never happened. Thanks for coming by, Detective. He did it again. There should be 30 more dollars in here. That was me. I- I was short on cash this morning. Did you climb through the window to get it? Next time, clean up your dirt. Your son is stealing from us again. He's back on drugs. Mary, I told you, I took it. Eric is fine. My God, you believe that? And I got some cash today, so I can pay you back. Kim Decker? We didn't kick her out. Her parents transferred her to Northridge. It's an inpatient program, specializes in dual diagnosis. When? A couple months ago. And God knows where after that. Program junkies. And yeah. When she was here, the Fisher kid was all over her. He was a bad influence? A couple weeks after Kim left, we caught him freebasing in the parking lot. And you kicked him out. There's no freebasing on campus. It's one of our big rules. Did he do something to Kim? You should talk with her parents. The mom. She and Kim, they're pretty tight. Hey, there. Hey. You worked today? Ellen asked me to cover her shift. Mommy, my hair! You finish her, I'll finish dinner. - This one's name is Leafy. - This one's name is B.B. This one's name is Lucky. And this one's name is B.B. B.B.? I am the hair-drying monster. I'm the hair-drying monster! Go away, monster. Monster dry.Go away, monster. Monster dry. That's 32 extra horses right there, man. You're a fucking wizard, man. Hit it, Chris. About fucking time. Yeah. Kill it. Kill it! Shit. Fuck.Yo, you almost burned his fucking face off.I-I know, Trey. Fuck!Are you okay? We can't do this shit with no money, man. So let's get some. My man Romer's got some sweet new producto. Romer's Hells Angels.Peruvian flake. Real money, real quick. Great. Then-then you deal it. "E.T. Performance Auto." Eric and Trey. No more stupid fucking bullshit dumpster diving. A real business, all right? A neon sign so big, you can see that shit from fucking Mulholland Drive, man. It's time to man up. Henry said that he took the money? That's just perfect. Sounds just like him. You should really think about inpatient care again. Henry won't pay for another rehab. Well, if Eric had cancer, would he pay for chemo? Addiction is a disease. You have to treat it. And he has to want to get better. You know, taking him groceries, paying for that apartment... it's not helping, honey. He's just getting worse. We have to help him. Really help him. Or he's gonna die. Mare? Do you want me to get the door? Afternoon. I'm looking for Henry Fisher. Is he home? May I ask what this is about? Kim helped him. And you, what, paid her parents off so she wouldn't file charges?Honey, calm down. He attacked that girl. We don't know that. No more. The apartment, the money. It stops now. Mary, he's our son. That's right, and you're his father. Yes, right, and it's all my fault? I booked a bed for him at the New Ellis Clinic. I wrote a check for $2,500. What, without asking me? Make sure it clears. He's checking in Friday morning, 10:00 a.m. sharp. Make sure your son shows up. This girl... she's telling the truth. It's-it's these fucking parents. Pay attention here. DDA Shapiro, please. Rod. James Connor, Van Nuys. Look, Dave Russell's coming in with an assault. He said, she said, fucked-up teens. Feels like a reject to me. I'd appreciate that. Walk over, get your blue slip, and move on. It's my fucking case. Not much of one. You can thank me later. You've really got your mom worked up about this. Yeah. Well, she's... she's serious about this rehab thing. And-and so am I. I- I think it's a good idea. I know, and you're right. I have to go. And I will. I will. I just... I'm in trouble. Right now I... I owe money, and I have to pay. Drug money. Yeah. All right. Then... then think of it this way. The... this New Ellis Clinic thing? It's... it's salvation and escape. Are you fucking kidding me? Dad, you can't hide from these people. They will find me. How much do you owe? A lot. Okay, here's the plan. If I give you the money now and we go and pay these people off, you're at the house first thing Friday morning... Yes...ready to check in. Yes.
