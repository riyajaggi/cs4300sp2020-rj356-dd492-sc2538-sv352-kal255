 of murder in the second degree. You don't belong here. I'm leaving you money. New lawyers, new investigators. Chris Keller didn't put you here. We got to focus on what did. The cops, the judge, the evidence. Russell falsified tons of evidence. He fucked me every way he could. You have any proof? I got all kinds of proof. I just fucking love prison. Lieutenant Russell straight-up lied to my parole board in writing. LAPD Internal Affairs has to go after Russell. Sergeant Ian Lynch. Lynch, Internal Affairs. Eric Fisher, the shithead who killed his mother? Who I put in prison? Who deserves to die there? That guy? This Lynch asshole, he's not gonna stop. You think I'm that kind of cop?No. Get this piece of shit out of here. He smells.It's me. It's Dave. Word around the office is the captain's pissed. You're taking too long, Ian. It's not your shoe print. Someone else was in the house, and I'm thinking it was Chris Keller. Get in the car.What's going on? Get in the car. You drive. Trey? Okay, okay, let's go.Shit. I knew, I knew... Did you tell anyone? No. Trey would've killed me, like, he would've killed me. I need an ambulance. Hurry. My mom-- she's fucking dying, okay? Just get over here. Easy. Why do you want to talk to them? You hate cops. Did you do something really bad? I did. I did. You want me to send you to Texas? Credible witness. Claims that Chris Keller's the killer. It's not my job, or yours. Well, i-if Eric Fisher didn't kill his mother, you're not interested in who did? You want to work homicide, take the fucking detective test. Your report. On the letter only, on my desk today. Captain, he-he's got full-blown AIDS. The witness in Texas, Trey Carano. I.A. time limits are not gonna mean shit when Eric Fisher files a civil suit in this case. You know, his P.I., Charlie Shannon, he's got reporters on speed dial. Carano is a potential exculpatory witness. If we don't talk to him and he dies, how's that gonna look? Look, I'll go to Texas, I'll knock it right out. I'll have my report on your desk by Monday. Fine. Thank you, Captain. Yeah, get me Curtis at RHD. Hi, Harry, it's me, Alex. Yeah, I've got a situation here. You got a detective who can travel to Texas? - Friedman's pissed. - You pushed her into this trip. If that happens, all you've got is the parole board letter. Dave Russell skates with his "Not Resolved."No, Louise, that's what happens if I don't go. Look, Amy Harlow, right, she says that Eric Fisher wasn't there. If I don't get that backed up from Carano... You want to be the hero. Solve the case. Yes. I want this freaking asshole gone for everything, for all of it. I know Lynch. He wants to be fucking Jim Rockford. He's gonna talk to Carano. No, he's not. Yeah, he is. Yeah, he is. God, he fucking is, man. And what's-what's-what's Carano gonna say? "Yeah, no, I was at the crime scene, but I waited in the car while fucking Chris Keller fucking murdered her"? Carano's a fucking snake, man. You know, he got my dad to give him my car so he could go track down Chris Keller in San Francisco. Guy smoked dope for a week, told my dad he was this fucking close. You got to call Lynch, but you got to talk to him, you got to stop him. I mean, Carano will undermine Lynch's entire report. No, he won't.Yes, he will, man. I told him Carano was a dead end when I handed him the Harlow tape. Look, Lynch filed his report yesterday. Now, just relax. Okay? This is happening. That's a lot of questions. I like to be prepared. you know? Just remember, you want checkable facts. Why does Carano want to talk to you? Does he need to get something off his chest? Or is he using you, setting you up for a lie he wants you to believe? Only way to know is through checkable facts, and you get those by letting him talk, having a conversation, not through a bunch of pre-determined questions. Thank you. I'll let you know if I need anything else. There it is. Get that. Put it on the chair. I got it. I- I got it. Easy. Slower. I told him 15 minutes, no more. You can't touch him. One more infection and he'll die. Excuse her. My sister's a very cautious person. Okay. So this is a recording of Internal Affairs interview on complaint file 03014A96. So I want to take you back to early 1983, around the time of...He didn't do it. ...murder of Mary Fisher. Who? My boy. Eric. He didn't... didn't do it. So I'm going to ask you a few questions. Back then, did you know an Amy Harlow? She recalls an incident.How is she? It was near the time of the murder, um, she-she says that you picked her up from work. Well, I would... I picked her up every day. Well-well, this day, Chris Keller was in the car with you, and the three of you, you drove-- Well, she thought that she was going to Disneyland, but you parked a couple of blocks from the Fisher house.She said that? You and Amy waited in the car. Keller went to the Fisher house to get money from Mr. Fisher, and when he returned, he wasn't wearing his leather jacket. Amy said he was, he was very upset. You, too. And that she thinks that something happened in the house. Well... You want me to stay? Yeah. I'll be here right behind you. Amy thought that something happened in the house. See... First of all, I would never have had Chris Keller in the car to pick Amy up. You're saying that Amy's lying? I don't know. Maybe she thinks that this ha-happened. She always thought that Chris Keller was involved, but all of this... parking far away and jackets disappearing, sounds like she's tripping. So... I mean, that's the thing about the hot bitches, you know? They're so fucking crazy. I broke up with her... ...six times. Six times. She just wouldn't leave. You can ask my sister. This is the girl that wanted to marry me. So, Chris Keller, then. Why did Amy think that he was involved? Fucking everybody thought that Chris Keller was involved. He was violent. He loved knives. But that cop, you know. That cop had it in for Eric. So you're saying Eric didn't kill his mother. I'd swear it with my last breath. Then who did? The devil. Man... you're a thousand short. Hey, man, I told you. I told you. You said it was cool. I lied. Come on, man... You got a problem with that? But thanks for dropping by. All right, hold on. We can work this out here. Hold him! No, no, no. No, no, no, wait a minute. Let me-- I can fix this. Yeah? How you gonna fix it? Front me another quarter. Okay, I'll gram it out, I'll pay you back. I'll pay you back all the money, I swear to God. I just need a couple days. That sounds like a plan. If you give me a kiss. 'Cause I like to get kissed while I'm getting fucked! Okay. Okay! Okay. I want my money. Okay, just wait. Look, my parents are rich, man. They're rich, okay? My dad's got a stamp collection that's worth, like, a fucking hundred grand.100,000. That's bullshit! No, it's not! It's not bullshit. I swear to God, I'll sell a couple. I'll sell a couple, I'll come back, I'll give you the money. I'll give you the whole fucking grand, man, I swear to God. Trey, is he telling the truth? You do that. Bring it to the club tonight. Fucking watch yourself. Tonight? Tonight. You got a problem with that? Eric was in deep shit. Really fucking deep. He didn't even know how fucking deep. Fuck, man! Shit. Where we going?Where the fuck do you think I'm going? My mom's home. Fucking stamp shop closes at 6:00. I don't get it, man. You think this is about a thousand bucks? I am gonna pay him back. You just told Romer that your dad has 100,000. What do you think he's gonna do? He's gonna rob your fucking house. He and Ray are gonna take the safe and anything else that he can get his hands on after you've paid him the thousand. You get that, right? Just pull over.I can't breathe. I can't breathe, I can't breathe.Just calm down. Pull over, man. Fucking pull over! Fuck. Fuck, man. They're gonna fucking kill 'em, man. Fucking Romer's Hells Angels. And Ray Pine fucking shot a guy six times and threw him out a fucking window! Your parents are gonna be fine. How the fuck can you even say that? Because they're not gonna be there. Your mom brings you groceries every Thursday, right? So Thursday morning she's at Gelson's, right? Your dad's at the office. The house is empty, right?Yeah. Tonight, we go to the club. You keep your mouth fucking shut. I'll tell Romer you know the combination. You know how to get into the house. We hit the house, but it's got to be Thursday, I can't. I can't. I can't, man. You got to. You got to. It's the only way.I can't do that, I can't. You want to protect your parents, this is the only way! Look... I'm your friend, man. I know. I know. I'm trying to help you out here. Okay? I know, man. I know, I know. I know. Thank you, man. You just... you got to stop being such a fucking pussy. Okay? Okay? Dude, do these, and then we'll go. Come on, come on, come on. It's gonna be okay. Come on. Eric? It's just me, Chris. Hey. Hey. My dad... kicked me out. Can I-- Can I crash? Hey, come on, come on, come on! Launch time, baby. Your rocket ship awaits. We got shit to do. Okay. What's wrong?You gotta help me, man. What's going on? Just come in. You gotta-- You gotta help me. Hey, what's up? Yeah, you won't do it in the bathroom, though. Look at this. Kermit the fucking Frog in olive oil. Put it right here and then give me that shit, man. What the fuck? Did I tell you to bring your girlfriend there? We gotta talk. No, talk's over. You got my money? We both know it's not about the money that I owe you, okay? You're gonna rob my parents' house, we're gonna fucking help you. You want to do it without the combination to the safe, without knowing how to get in, or-or when it's gonna be empty, just be my fucking guest. And when this is done, you guys are even. Just leave my fucking friend alone. You're spunky, man. Your girlfriend's spunky. All right, big man. Come on in, brother. Come on, I got some fine folks here I want you to meet. Hey, everybody. Say hello to Eric. So, Thursday? Yeah, man. Thursday. Morning. He's not up for this. Look at him. Come on, he's a fucking kid, man. Their fucking kid. It's his parents, man. Yeah. Who fucking kicked him out. That's the guy with the combination to the safe. You don't have it? Said he'd tell me when we're there. Anything we take, we split. Even. Equal shares. Everybody gets... the same. Equal shares, equal weight. So if this thing goes south... ...if he fucks up... I mean, if he talks, if he even whispers my fucking name... ...it's on you. There is no place I can't get to you. You know that, don't you, Trey? Good, man. Just, um, make sure he knows it, too. All right? Correct me if I'm wrong. You told Eric that Romer planned on robbing the house? But Romer never said so himself? He didn't have to. So, before you told Eric that, Eric ever plan to rob his parents? I'm just telling you what fucking happened. Right. I-I'm saying it sounds like you planned it. Like I planned it? Let me tell you something. There was no fucking plan. This was a bunch of meth addicts robbing a house. Chris Keller opens it up, we go inside, Eric stays outside. Eric was gonna be the... lookout. That was the big fucking plan. Really? An ice cream truck? He was a drug dealer. No one stops an ice cream truck. Romer used to drive out to the desert and he'd come back and this truck would be... filled with meth. So, on the tenth, March 10, what happened? Plan was fix up, head over to the house together. But... Yeah. That's not how it happened. Well, how didit happen, exactly? Exactly? I don't know. I wasn't there. Show me your hands!Hands, hands, hands! That morning, Feds busted into my place. Put me on a plane to Miami to testify at this murder trial. This guy I'd done quaaludes with in Lauderdale started... telling me about all the... people he killed. S- So, the Feds took you away on March 10, the morning of the murder? Jesus. All right, well, that's... I wanted to be there.Yeah. I wanted to protect him.But i-if you-- if you weren't there and you don't know what happened, then what in the hell am I sitting here for? 'Cause Romer told me. Right when I got back. He told me something, and I have had it in here... ...for 20 years. Man. I just got back from fucking Florida, man. Had to help my sister out with this bullshit. I was just hanging out here, gonna get a couple of burgers from your girlfriend, but she's not here. Might have to come back. You think he did it? What's up? Come on, man. Your little gram man killed his mom. Do you think he did it? What? It was like a... test. He wanted to see what I would say. Yeah, he did it.Fucking A he did it. Smacked out of his mind. He killed her... killed her high. I shot him up myself that morning. And he still owes me 15 bucks, man. You tell him that... ...if he ever gets out. That's how he told me. That's how I know what happened that day. He got rid of him. Man, Trey said he'd fucking be here!ROMER: Yeah, well, Come on, man, l-let's just...No, no, no, no, no! You don't understand, okay? He's supposed to be here. We're supposed to get high. Something must've happened. He... We got to fucking cancel, man. Cancel, my ass. Let's go now.- No!Or I'm gonna have Ray come up here and rip your fucking eyes out!I don't fucking care! Fucking do it, man! Fucking kill me! I don't give a shit. I'm not doing it without Trey. Chris, I can't, man, I fucking can't.He can't, okay? Not-not like this. Okay. I'll fix you. All right?CARANO: See, Eric never, ever did smack, and he never used a needle, not for anything. Come on. 15 bucks, man-- that is, like, a Romer-sized shot of pure heroin. No, no, no, not-not that. I don't-I don't want that. Yeah, you do. Got a real gentle touch, come on. I- I-I can't...Don't-don't do it. I can't pay you.That's cool, man. Don't worry about it. You can pay me later. Come on, man, he's-he's scared of needles. Just... We'll do... We'll-we'll-we'll-we'll do this another time, you know, when-when-when-when Trey's back? We can do this, like, next-next week, right? Yeah, next week, man. Makes sense.Okay. All right.- You'll be fine. Shit. What the fuck?Let's go. What did you give him?I said let's go! We might have to get a diamond drill, to take the whole fucking safe with us. What the fuck did you give him? Yeah, Einstein, do you know how much those fuckers even weigh? I don't give a fuck. Shit! Shit. Shit, man, she fucking saw us. I'm sorry. Get out. I'm calling the cops. I- I didn't think you'd be here. I- I'm just... My mom kicked me out. Get out.Okay. I'm-I'm leaving. Please just... don't call the cops.I have to. You broke into my home. I can't go to jail. Look at me, I'll-I'll fucking die. Well, that's your problem. You fucking bitch. So... who did it? Who killed her? Can't say. 'Cause you weren't there.'Cause he didn't tell me. Who do you think had it in them? I don't know. All of 'em. Any one of them that didn't have it in them? Yeah. Not Eric. Not my boy. Fuck. Fuck. Mom, you got to breathe, you got to breathe, Mom! I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. Yeah. Well... neither do I. Th-Thank you. Have you talked to Chris? Does he know? I don't know. I don't know. Just get you home. She was stabbed, Trey, and Chris, he's fucking missing. We have to go to the police. We have to tell them about Chris. I know. You think they're gonna listen? So what? Eric's your friend. Something you're not telling me. What the fuck's going on, Trey?Nothing. I don't want to fucking go to the cops. You're right, okay, baby? Hey. I'll go to them. I promise. Did you tell them? Cops. Come on. Thank you. All those years, you knew. Your friend was in prison, you didn't help him. He would have killed me. You've done a lot of bad things, Trey. A lot. This one you did good. You really did. - Hey, I really appreciate this. - I'll call you when I get back to L.A. Feds served the warrant at 0700 on March 10, took him straight to Florida to testify. Sent him back on the 12th. So that part was true. But even in Carano's version, Fisher had some part of it. All right? When to hit the house, how to get in, that all came from him. He was in on the plan. Maybe Carano's trying to beef up Eric's involvement so he doesn't come across as the mastermind, you know, so to speak. That's a big maybe. 'Cause everything we just heard? Hearsay, from a drug addict who wasn't there. Why I need to talk to Romer. Sergeant Lynch, Captain wants to talk to you. So RHD's gonna re-investigate Fisher. Gonna... Chen and-and Young-- they're-they're gonna handle it. You know how many months I've been working on this case? I know. I know exactly how many hours you've put in, and now you can't see straight.Okay. Okay. All right, well, the drug dealer-- Ken Romer-- we need to put a tap on his phone, we need to stimulate the wire. RHD's already talked to him. The Pines, too. Ruled them all out. What, so that's it? David Russell wins? Case closed? No. Case re-opened. Just not by you. Meanwhile, you can hand me your report, finished or not. And then pack up. I'm transferring you to the Davis Recruit Training Center. You'll catch some heat for this. Make it worth it. Chris Keller opens it up, we go inside, Eric stays outside. Eric was gonna be the lookout. That was the big fucking plan. Lieutenant Russell locked in on Eric the second he saw him. He framed an innocent 17-year-old boy just because he could. You read the Harlow interview. Do you have any reason to believe that she's lying? Any indication at all that she's not a reliable witness? Mr. Fisher. Theresa Adler. Los Angeles Herald Examiner. Let's start with Detective Dave Russell. Nothing about Carano. All about Russell. She's gonna fire you for this. Yeah. Um... yeah. Thank you. Hope you packed your toothbrush. He won't need that suit in prison. Cameron's not gonna let him walk. No way. All rise. She won't let it happen. Regrettably, we move to dismiss this case. Mr. Fisher, you're free to go. Good work. Yes! Yeah. Just give me one... second. Just give me a second. I just need to wash my hands. That okay with you? You know there's a lot of press outside. You may want to go out the back. Doesn't matter what anybody else thinks. We both know the truth. Yeah. We do. Just in time. They were just about to dump it. He seemed like a good guy. Yeah, that'd be nice. You know what? Actually, I'll just catch up with you in a minute. You want to go fishing? That'd be nice, yeah. When, Dad?You tell me. You're the one with the schedule. Yeah, and you're the one who's gonna get sued. You fought like hell to catch that fish. Remember that? And you cut your thumb on the line. But you just... you kept on fighting. How do you know? That's when I knew you were gonna turn out okay. Nice story, Dad, but you weren't there. 'Course I was. I remember. We... It was a great day. Sure. Okay. Look. I've got to go. I have trial prep, and I promised Nate dinner, so... You know Fisher's lawyer is gonna use this case to franchise himself, just like Johnnie Cochran? Hey, if I wasn't there, then who took this? It wasn't your mother. She gets seasick at the beach. No, you're right. It wasn't Mom. I took this. I was there. Who else? Right? I don't know, Dad. You're the detective. Frankly, I think Kershaw's gonna be a real star. You got to remember, he is 21 years old, the youngest Dodger pitcher since Sandy Koufax to strike out 13 or more batters in a game, and that was last April. Yeah, but what about the postseason? What about it? He pitched great against the Cardinals-- an extremely strong outing. And choked against the Phillies. They should have won that game, and he fell apart. I wouldn't say he fell apart. Please. You could see it in his eyes. He didn't have the guts. Now, that's kind of harsh, Frankie. You're talking about a 21-year-old... On March 10, 1983, Chris Keller, a drug addict who came to see my parents as a source of income... ...stabbed and murdered my mom.And you found her like that? She was still breathing. Yeah. I called the ambulance. I... I tried to save her.But then you were arrested? I mean, I was high. I had long hair. At the time, so did half the 17-year-old boys in California. No, yeah, I mean, and when you think about it, all it takes is one corrupt detective, and-and you're done. For life. I mean, it happens every day. You know, it happens to... to people, you know, people a lot less privileged than me. But it didn't stop there. That detective... Dave Russell. He lied. He faked evidence. A- And the letter. He wrote the parole board years later. He really had it in for you. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Why? Why did he go to such great lengths to keep you in prison? It's... it's a tough one, you know? I mean, I've had... 27 years to think about it. You know? I mean, that... that letter, I mean, I... it was... it was my first parole hearing. You know, nobody gets paroled their first time, and-and he knew that, so... Why? Right? Why'd he write it? I still don't get it. Rock on! Can I have your autograph? Can I help you? Yeah. Sorry. Um... I, I used to live here. I like what you've done with it. It's, um... it's nice. My husband's coming home any second, and we're going out... Sure. No, I'm-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. I was just... taking a look. Thanks. Hey, pal. Hey, buddy. What? What? I got you. I got you. Here. Just-just hold him right there. I think it's time for his nap. No, no. Eric. Eric? Okay, Mary, look over here. Mary. Mary, look at the camera. Come on, dear. Look at the camera. Aren't you happy? Aren't you happy, Mary?
