 What the fuck is wrong with you? Fuck off. Amy Harlow. Same social, same D.O.B. She moved around a lot the last 20 years, like she's running from something or someone. But you can't run from Charlie Shannon. All right, so let me get this straight. You want to go talk to her in Mexico? Yeah, she was your friend. Helped your father after. Stayed in touch. Until she didn't. This girl believed in you. Knew you were innocent.

 Maybe she's got a good reason for that. And what, she doesn't have a phone? No. No. No phone, no place. My guy says she's house-sitting for some bohunk photographer. Eric, she knew Chris Keller, lived with Trey Carano in your building. We need to find out what she knows. I don't know, I mean, what the hell happened to Internal Affairs doing this work for free? Lynch found the second shoe print. If he keeps doing his job... I.A.'s job is to put down shit cops like Dave Russell. My job is to do what he should have done in the first place besides getting locked in on you, which is to investigate. When we get a new trial, we gotta be prepared. That one bloody shoe print isn't gonna cut it. How much? It's Baja, not Barcelona. Get a cheap ticket, or take the fucking bus. Baby, let me drop you off at the hotel first, before. I'm just used to doing this alone, you know. I know girls like this, Charlie. You might need help. Yeah? What happened to let go and let God? I love you, too, babe. He's real bad, and he's getting worse. Hearing voices and screaming crazy shit. Like what? About killing you. Breaking your neck this time as soon as he gets out. You don't fix it now, he ain't gonna stop. Yes or no? You gonna do this? No, I can't do that. No, no. Shut up. Forget about it. Are you fucking insane? Go. Shut the fuck up! I can't do that. You hear me? No, God! I told you! No. No! Get the fuck out! Benny. It's me. Who is Eric fucking Fisher? Why are you here? The real... reason. Okay. Benny, shut up! Yes. "Swerve me? "My fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, "whereupon my soul is grooved to run. Swerve me?" Thank you. Get the fuck off! Up against the wall now!BENNY: Eric! We're not finished! What in the hell were you thinking? I was just checking on him, sir. And delivering contraband. I'll deal with you next, Officer. Look, with all due respect, sir, whatever you're giving him is not working. He needs something-- Our doctors have his meds under control. Benny is sick, sir! I see. Go! Move! Good news, Fisher. You just earned him more SHU time. Ms. Harlow. It's, Charlie Shannon. I've been trying to reach you. She's not here! It's about Eric Fisher. Look, I-I just need a few minutes. Go away.It's like I said, if you can just give me a few minutes of your time, please. I told you she's not here, so... Look, Ms. Harlow, I know it's you. All right, and it's about Eric Fisher. Did you, did you not hear me? Do you want me to call the cops?No, I... - Goddamn it, Charlie! - I'm so sorry, honey. I- I told him to call first. Baby, you can't just show up at people's homes. It's rude. New husband. Haven't trained him yet. Sandy Shannon. Could I use your bathroom? Please. Just... use it fast. Thank you. It was a long time ago. Just trying to move forward here. So is your friend Eric. He needs some truth for that. Anything you remember. Look, if you think there's even a chance Eric killed his mother, then... He didn't. I know he didn't. He couldn't. Well, that's good. That's what he believes, too. He said you'd remember. Yeah, baby. That was Joan Jett and the Blackhearts... No, you keep it. Hall & Oates right before here on Music 91... Here. For me? Yeah. Really? Yeah, I think she kind of looks like you. Or her-her spirit. You know? I-- it's-it's her last, it's her last album. Yeah. Came out after she died. You know, I saw it, and I-I thought... What? What?Just... What? What were you thinking?I just thought... Stop. Okay. You just gonna watch? I'm not a great dancer. Sure you are. Because I am. Just follow me. Feel it. Feel it in your hips. Calmer. Yeah, just like me. Good. Keep spinning. Did you two, ever go out? Are you kidding? I was 20. He was just a kid. You were living with a friend of his. Trey something, an-an Italian name. Right. That's it. Time to go. 20 years. Eric Fisher has been locked up for 20 years for something that he didn't do. And you know it.Okay. Think about that. If you could help him, if you know anything... Hey. It's okay. I mean, really, we're on your side. Slow and smoothly. Right? Yeah! Don't turn it off. You guys look, I mean, great together. It's Janis Joplin, man. She got amazing pipes. Amazing what? I've got some stuff to do. You should leave. She got some stuff to do, I guess. You should leave. How long were you with him? Six years. When last did you speak to him? Day I left. Check this out. - Yeah, man. - Try that again. Dude, you're making a fucking mess. See what happens. Look what I fucking found. Check this out, bro.Is that a fucking nest right here? No. If you touch the eggs, the mother won't come back for them. No, she doesn't need to. I'm gonna teach them how to fly. All right, ready? Spread your wings. You can't fly? Come on. I know you can do it. You got to leave the nest sometime. Yeah! Where's the, fucking opener, pumpkin? Only man I know who can't open a beer with his hands. Babe... Trey...You make me fucking sick. Trey, stop it! Get the fuck off of me! Yeah. Okay.Stop it! Okay.Stop. The next day, he goes out to score some dope. And he comes back. Surprise. Amy's gone. I did it. Even his sister helped me. Carano. He had something to do with Mary Fisher's murder. Okay. What about Chris Keller? I... Hey. I didn't have to do that. Look, if Eric didn't do it, you need to tell us who did.Get the fuck out! You know what? She's serious, right? Just get the fuck out.You knew he was innocent. No, we're not leaving. She knows something. She's gonna tell us what happened. I knew it. I should've done this alone. Really? Yeah. Eighth Amendment issue? Well, Benny was diagnosed here on intake. Throwing him in the SHU, not being on top of his meds... Cruel and unusual punishment. Yep. So, if Benny's not taking his meds on his own, he's got a right to proper involuntary medication. All right. Fuck. Institutional protection.Boom. Well done, grasshopper. Señora. Señora, para. Señora, para. Señora, para. Deténgase. Señora. Get your hands off me! See that? See what you did? Calmese. Calmese, señora. Calmese. Ahora tengo que llamar la policía, señora. Calma. Calmese. Fuck you! If you tell us the rest, we'll get you out of here. No charges, fresh start. If you don't, we walk. We want to help. I know a good rehab a few hours away. We could get you set up there. What do you say? You ready to walk out of here? Is that a yes? Okay. Okay. Come on. Charlie. Charlie! Shit. You know, she don't look so vicious passed out. She's not passed out, shithead. I hope you're ready to hear this. Something I heard at my first meeting. "We're only as sick as our secrets." You keep that shit inside, it kills you. Eric didn't do it. He wasn't even there. Yeah, how do you know that? Because I was. Trey used to pick me up from work. He had my car. He was always late, except that day he was early. Time to go. I'm not done with my shift yet. But if we don't leave now, we're gonna be late for the parade. Happiest place on earth. Disneyland? We're going? Look out for that hippo! What? Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Okay. Go. Go. I got this.Thanks, Melanie. 'Bout fucking time. And you're sure Chris Keller was there? Which was weird because Trey didn't even know Chris that well. We're gonna make a quick stop. Eric's dad said he would give us some money for tickets. Where is Eric? Right here's good. We parked the car a couple of blocks away. That's when Chris got out. It's Thursday. Isn't Mr. Fisher at his office? Will you just shut the fuck up for a change? We're not going to Disneyland. What the fuck is taking this guy so long? Come on, man. Get in the car.What's going on? Get in the car. You drive. Hey.Trey? What happened? Trey? We got to get the fuck out of here.TREY: Okay. Okay, okay, let's go. Let's go. Shit. Drive. That fucking jacket. He looked so lost without it. Just fucking drive the car! And this was March 10? You're sure? Amy. It was March 10, day of the murder. Eric's dad called the next day-- he was, like... He called me at work, and, he said he needed help cleaning up. : It was a mess. He said that Eric, that he, that he was in jail, and I just, I knew, I- I-I knew. Did you tell anyone? I mean, any of it? Trey, he would've killed me, like, he would've killed me. Amy, he can't hurt you now. He can't. I mean, I know this was difficult for you, but you did... you did great. You did so good.Okay. I packed you a bag. What? I mean, I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, you are. You're gonna get sober. And a month from now, you are gonna be a whole new person. You're-you're gonna be stronger. Strong enough to testify. What are you talking about? I'm not testifying to shit. Okay.Because I didn't tell you anything. Give me that back. That's-that's mine! That's my voice! Come on, let's go. Let's go.SANDY: Honey, just wait a second. One... God. Listen, anytime, day or night, you call me, okay?I won't call you. Fuck you. I'll fucking sue you! And this was March 10? You're sure? Amy. It was March 10, day of the murder. Now, as far as we know, Russell never even questioned her or even tried to. Trey Carano. Henry Fisher, he gave Eric's car to Carano. Forget Carano. We got everything we need. You add this to the parole board letter, the-the glare bullshit, Chris Keller's shoe print, you file your report now, while Eric's still got some life ahead of him. That's the only way Eric's case gets reopened. The original. I have a copy. I remember this. That was your chance to play big-time P.I. on TV. Looked like fun. Yeah, that's right. I'm only in it for the money? Inadequate protection of an inmate in the SHU? I got in there. Come on, look, because the inmate's severe mental illness was initially diagnosed here, this institution is legally required to transfer him to another place where that illness can be treated. Makes sense. Because there are so many fine psych facilities in the California prison system. I'm just giving you a heads-up, sir, before I file that with the warden. No need. I just talked to him. Since the new meds are working and there's no other place to put him, Benny stays right here. For your protection, in a different block. Sir, he tried to kill me. I mean, I'm still gonna see him. I'll see him on the yard. I'm gonna see him at chow...Have you seen him? I released him this morning. He's in D block. There you go. You're welcome. So you're saying Carano threatened to bite this guy. Yeah, can you just fax me a copy of the arrest report? The arrest report. You want me to send you to Texas? Credible witness claims that Chris Keller's the killer. An unverified report from Fisher's P.I. in Mexico. That's why I got to go. I got to corroborate with Trey Carano. Not my job or yours. If Eric Fisher didn't kill his mother, you're not interested in who did? There are time limits. Dave Russell's captain's been calling me, asking me where we are on this thing. You want to work homicide? Take the fucking detective test. Your report, on the letter only, on my desk today. Captain. It's not the end of the world, but it's not great news. Internal Affairs shut Lynch down. Forced him to limit his report to Russell's letter to the parole board, nothing else. And they transferred him to another department. It's okay. I mean, we've still got a couple of moves left. RHD is going to reinvestigate your case. Two cold case coppers. Fucking RHD. Yeah, it's like the fox guarding the fucking henhouse. Okay, now, listen. Ian Lynch gave me his real report. The big one. The one he didn't file. I talked to a couple of reporters, and they're real interested. What, like Lynch was interested? How much of my dad's money did you give him? I get it. You're upset.Yeah, what was it? Was it enough to string him along while he worked the complaint? Gives you enough time to drain my fucking bank account. Look, we got a great case. Everything Lynch did, everything I've done, Okay.we've got that. Yeah, okay. You know what? Actually, you know what? I- I feel... I feel pretty good. I feel pretty good, Charlie. You know, I feel like... I feel like a big weight has just fallen from my shoulders, you know? A big, greedy, blood-sucking leech. Guard.Eric... Look, do you want to fire me? I just fucking did. Okay, look, you add these names to your visitors list, okay, 'cause I'm not giving up. Russell never talked to Amy Harlow? Not as far as we know. He never even tried. Lieutenant Russell locked in on Eric the second he saw him. He framed an innocent 17-year-old boy just because he could. We pulled the old clips. The arrest, the trial coverage. There is a lot of evidence against him, Mr. Shannon. I mean, maybe Russell helped that evidence a little... No, no, no, no. He helped a lot. And when he needed to, he made shit up. Do you think the LAPD really cleaned up after Rampart, after Rodney King? What about the cops who were here before, who stayed through? You think they changed, because, what, the Christopher Commission or the Feds told them they had to? You read the Harlow interview. Do you have any reason to believe that she's lying? Any indication at all that she's not a reliable witness? Look, like we said... we'll look into it. If there is something here, we will get back to you.Yeah, you know... Save it. It was my mistake. I thought you were real reporters. "I thought you were real reporters." Yard time is over. Inmates, stand by for count. Yard time is over. Inmates, stand by for count. "For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." - Get him, Benny! - Fucking kill him! All cell block D and C guards to the yard. All cell block D and C guards to the yard. Kiss the ground! Everybody, get down!Face down! Hands down! We have a Code 3. Hostage situation. An inmate has a weapon to C.O. Murphy's throat. Back the fuck up!Calm down. Recall and lock it up. Yard detail is now on lockdown. Yard detail is now on lockdown. I don't have a clear shot. It's okay. No! Shot fired. Shot fired. Man down. I got to check. You all right? Yeah. Roll over. Hands behind your back. Do not move! All right, let's get 'em down. Let's get 'em down. Let's clear them out. What are you looking at? Hands down! Facilities are on lockdown. All inmates, return to your cells and don't move. Wait for the count. They teach you how to do that at law school? No. Now I just got to eat it. This is-is the orange monster. Orange monster say gimme... gimme. Orange monster say go. S- Stand the fuck down! Hey, Dad. Nice hat. Hey, honey. Hey. Monster voice. It's just like yours. Get this piece of shit out of here. He smells! It's me. It's Dave. Dave.Yeah. That was my son's name. Yeah, that's right, Grandpa. Must be a slow news day. We got a tip. Got to follow up. From Charlie Shannon? Eric Fisher's P.I.? Now, the word on him is he got canned for falsifying arrest reports, this guy. Back to Eric Fisher. Whose bloody footprints were all over his mother's house, who hated her, who was a spoiled, entitled junkie, a violent meth head who laughed at her when she gave him money and stole from her when she stopped. She kicked him out at 15, nailed all the windows shut, because she was that scared of him. Eric Fisher... who confessed... in detail. The Manning confession. I understand there were some questions about, um, Paul Manning's credibility. Not from me. And not from the D.A. and not from the jury. 'Cause I had too much real evidence to risk that case with even a whiff of a false confession. So listen, Manning said that Fisher crushed his mother's head with a workout bar, okay? He called it the QuadroBow. Well, there were lots of details in your follow-up report... Yes. Yes. But the QuadroBow wasn't one of them. So Manning got that straight from Eric Fisher. And if you want more, you can check out Eric Fisher's four or five other confessions. And if you still have questions after that, you can call me. Maybe I could... sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. I mean, I could use the money for my retirement. Eric Fisher is exactly where he belongs. What the fuck do you want? Nice seeing you, too. Follow me. Mr. Fisher. Theresa Adler-- Los Angeles Herald Examiner. Arun Vemuri. Thanks for, um, putting us on your list. Sit down. For some reason, California prisons aren't big on inmate visits with working press. How does this work? Well... let's start with, Detective Dave Russell. Why don't you tell us about him.
