Trust me. Otherwise, you'd be like them. - I don't understand. What am I supposed to do'? - Beats me. Just don't fall asleep. . Okay" Okay. Okay. ♪ ? ♪ ? ♪ ? This quiet. I don't think \'ll ever gel used to it. Like being stuck in fucking outer space. - Now you're just stalling. Come on, this was your idea. Now you've got to pay the price. Don't be a pussy. - It's just that I don't really like needles. You know thai, come on, don't. Oh, fuck! You said you'd count to three! - I would have done that, you, fuck! - See, it hurts, doesn't it, you little bastard. - Come on, let's go, we're both just wasting time. Let's go, g0, 90v go, go, gm so, so! ♪ ? - Few things are worth being stabbed in the heart for, Sam. This was one of them. The other was Randy Conroy in the eighth grade. She liked to stab in the back. Bitch. I'm sure she had her reasons. Lily, what are you doing in the hot tub'? - What'! We can't relax too'? - Get out! - What are you yelling for'? You guys are in the pool. - Your body temperature's gonna raise and when it drops back down, it won'! be good. It'll be bad. Understand? Get out. Get out! - Come on, guys, we're getting out too. - Fine. - What was that about not raising your body temperature? - They were naked. - Yeah, you noticed that too, huh? Come on' let's go, I can already feel the crash coming on. Helm? Earth to pervy 13-year-old. - Every 13-year-old is pervy. It's kind of our thing. Ah. - Ah. Oh. So, uh, you like Rachel? - Eh. She's the best of the, uh, non-dead girls we know, I guess. - Cool, uh, don't have sex with her. - Are you calling dibs'? - Orgasms release melatonin. It's a hormone, and a sedative. Where do you come up with all this shit? - I'm a pervy 13-year-old with ADHD and internet. - Well, you don't have to worry. I happen to hold the world record for falling asleep after sex so you can relax. - Just looking out for you. - It goes both ways. Don'! go jerking off in a corner and getting yourself killed. - I was always worried about the dangers of masturbation. - You and me both, kid. Hey, Jake? . Yeah? - You think I'll ever live long enough to have sex'? - That is the best life goal thai I have ever heard And lam going to ensure that you see it through. Or die trying. - So, uh, what about you'? - Like I said, I've already had plenty of bad sex. - No. Why are you still awake? - I don't know. Just seems better than the alternative. Sam, I'm not sure I ever told you, but I'm glad you came into my life, you and your friend, Ritalin. To think I wasted aH those years on crystal when this shit was legal. Now, who's hungry? I wonder how many people are left in China. - More than here. They were awake when it started, right? 3:00 a.m. here is, what, five or six in the evening there? We didn't even have a chance. Here they just wiped us out, like fucking ninjas. - Not all of us. You know, you still haven't told me how you actually survived it. - You know who had it really good? Europe. It was morning there. You'd be coming off a full night's s\eep, nice, nice head start. - Except those lazy bastards who hit the snooze button. No, it is, it is, it is weird, and I know. - Are they fighting? - No, it's Lily again. - Okay? What'! It's very weird. No, you should know that. No! N0, H0, no! What' what do you want me to do? And the fucking, goddamn filth is driving me nuts. Just stop. - I'll take care of her. Hey' hey. - I'm gonna go take a leak. I peed in the pool. It's probably half piss by new, to be honest. - I pissed in too. I just wish I didn't feel like being stabbed in the bladder every time I take a piss. These diuretics are killing me. - You don'! even know what that word means. - It means things that make you piss, piss like a diabetic camel. - I used to have this girl down in Panama City when I was younger. This guy is still at it. They call it siesta, siesta. - Well, We got a new theory. . Yeah? Shoot. - Radioactive space probe. Passes by before anyone sees it, affects the atmosphere of the entire planet, we breathe it in, poof. Simultaneous altered brain states. - That is the plot of Night of the Living Dead. It's also incredibly dumb, especially for someone who uses words like diuretics. - It's a good movie. - It's a classic. Look' who gives a shit what this is? It just is. We've just got to survive it. That's what we've got to do. - We become sharks. - What'! Sharks. They don't weep' you know. - Yeah, exactly. We're an adaptable species. We survived the comet that killed the dinosaur, the fucking dinosaurs, T-Rex's brother, whoever. Think on that. - That's not entirely true, but I kind of see your point. Sex kills and the seas are full of sharks. This world fucking sucks. - Not if you're a shark. - To becoming sharks, then. - To becoming sharks. Probably should have washed our hands before we did all that. No, oh, my God, no! She's at it again. - No, that was Rachel. Rachel? " No! No, this cannot. What, what happened'? - We were playing games and I left. She iust, she's just. Wake up. Wake up. - Jake, get the adrenalin. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Come on, Lily, come on, come on. Come on, Lily. Come on, Jake! I'm sorry. - I don't wanna die, ldon'twanna die. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die. What's happening to my fucking fife? First it was 15 and then 11 and then seven and then four, now three. - Rachel, you need to calm down. - Stop giving orders like you know shit! You're just a fucking kid and now Lily's fucking dead! What, how much time was left? How much time was left'? . UN - - How much goddamn time was left? Great. The drugs aren't even working anymore. First it was sugar and then caffeine and then cigarettes and now the hard fucking drugs aren't even fucking working. - We don't know that, Rachel. - Yes, we do. Tell me you can't feel it. Tell me it's not getting worse. We've just got to up the dose. We've got to get more and we cannot run out. She sat behind me in ninth grade. Can you guys just. Yeah. - Please'? - Yeah, we'll take care of it. Just, it'll take a minute or. Yeah, thanks. This is a waste of time. - Well, what else are we doing right now? Should we say something? Right hand, red. - Maybe a moment of silence would be best. Well, on the bright side, we don't have to worry about having sex anymore. - Says who? Come on' I'm just fucking with you, man. - The backpack, it's gone! - You fucking bitch, that was all we had left! - Come on, Jake, we're never gonna catch her! We've gotta go to a pharmacy. - Before the house we were in a fucking car. What were we doing? - Who gives a shit? I can barely remember an hour ago. - An hour ago you were starting at tits! Fucking think! - AH right, all right. Um' before the house there was, uh, uh, fireworks, before the house fireworks on Glen Peak. - I was driving. - Yeah, I think you were. - Hold on. - You want to tell me where we're going? - A man's got to know his limitaiions You know who said that'? Dirty fuckin' Harry. - What does that even mean'? - I never fill the gas tank and I sure as fuck didn't fill it before Glen Peak. So the only working gas station in town. Ha ha ha, bitch! - I'm not gonna question it, but you need to go faster. Oh, man, no, stay awake, Jake, come on. Come on, stay awake! Stay awake! - Stay awake, Jake. - Come on' come on! Come on, Jake, stay awake! - Man, you've got to stop yelling. That hurts my ears and my feelings. - Shit. - Yo, what time? - All right, okay. AH right. Come on, Jake, hurry. Okay, okay, you got this, you got this. Cars are simple, just like for-za. Don't be a pussy. Fuck. Shit! Oh, no, no. Come on' Jake, come on. Tell me you've got a stash. Come on, Jake! Come on, come on. No, stay UP! Come on, Jake. Tell me you got something. Something! Sorry about this, Jake. Three! Fuck! - Now stay the fuck awake. - You couldn't tell me to stay away. You can't even stay away from me, Meg. - I'm not your sister. - What a mean thing to say. Hey, Meg. - Still not Meg. - Well, whoever the fuck you are, there's something falling from the sky. If it's a dinosaur comet, you should really be iust fine. Oh, the dinosaur comet kind of looks like an airplane. - I'm trying to focus here so if you could shut the heH up that would be great. . Okay" - We'll try to ram her off the road. Jake! - Was ljust haHucinating a second ago? - Yeah. - Am I hallucinating now'? - I don't know. - Did you just stab me with a screwdriver before a plane hit our car'? - Yeah, I think that part was real, yeah. . Okay" Ow! Helm'? Are you all right'? - Son oi a Mich. Well, congratulations, you grounded her. - I'm fairly certain we had the right of way. - Oh, that's real funny. Thafs topnotch. - Look, we're sorry. We're both crashing pretty hard so if you have any spare drugs or anything, thafd be great, you know, just short-term. - I've been to eight cities in three days. I haven't seen anyone your age since the first. I guess that's worth something. It's not gonna buy you much time, kid. - It'll buy us enough, thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Thanks for the patches. You just saved our lives. - Well, you probably just doomed everyone else's. - That's a bit dramatic. So, uh, listen. I don't suppose you, uh, I don't suppose you saw any pharmacies while you were up there, huh? - What'! - Come on, we're good guys. We just, somebody stole our drugs. Looks like your car still works. Yeah, seems that way. - There's a hospital on this map, but there's not a hospital where the map says. - Makes sense. - How you figure? - You see, this used to be Si. Sebastian's but it closed like a year ago. I mean ii was replaced by the medical center near downtown. - You can get us there? - Oh, yeah, I've definitely been dumped there many times in my day. Hey! If we take you there, you have to help us find a pharmacy' That's the deal. - It won't be necessary. - And why the heH not? - Because hospitals have pharmacies. - Dumb ass. - Is that your dad? - Are you serious? - You sure you should be with him' kid? I think he's an addict-. - Look, I'm pretty sure we're all addicts now. My name's Sam, by the way. - Ellis. Captain on occasion. - I think it's more of the occasion for Ellis. - You're right. - Hey, you said there weren't any other kids in any other cities. - Not since Newark, no. That doesn't mean they're not out ihere. It just means I haven'! seen them. I've seen plenty of people, though. They're still kicking. - Holy shit, I think ljusi pissed out my entire liver. I can't wait to do it again in five minutes. Whew. - You should see the back of my plane. Musl have filled four milk jugs on the flight over. Let me tell you, some scavenger will get a real rude awakening if he's thirsting for lemonade. - Is ironic the word'? - Word for what'? - Like the fact that mankind is literally pissing away his last days. - That would be the word. But we don't have to piss it away. Somewhere out there, there's an answer for this. We just have to find it. - While continuing to piss all the time'? It's not mutually exclusive. - Pissing is somewhat unavoidable in the short term. You guys go find your pharmacy. L'H be in the ICU if it strikes you. - Long day- - Yeah, it's just getting started. ♪ ? - Yeah. - Good morning. - Yeah, some assholes already raided the pharmacy. - I'm your asshole. - I'm sorry, what? - I am the asshole that raided the pharmacy. Singular. - I'm also a single asshole. - Uh, I'm Ally. You want me to take a wok at that? - Uh, sure, that would be great, doc. And any, uh, pick-me-ups would be greatly appreciated. - We've got just the thing. Come on. Follow me. It's adrenalin. Well, saline too, and a bunch of other stuff we probably shouldn't mix but more bang for your buck than anything you can inject or snort. Don't touch it. 38 times the legal dose. Anything more and your heart is gonna pop like a balloon. - Noted, thanks. Hey, how's yours holding up over there? He's your son? - Don't know. I was too cheap to get the test results. Kidding. No. What are you to me, Sam? - Uh, indispensable. - There it is. Look, I know this is probably a dumb question but you're not actually an operating hospital, right? I mean, not anymore? - No. Now what you see is what remains of the last night shift ever to work here. Well, those of us who decided to stay, at least. Now I thought we could just put our heads together and try and figure this thing out. - What have you got so far? - Jack and, uh, shit. But we're alive, right? All right, let's get you back to your friend. - You made it. - Okay, here's the rest. Hi, I'm Sarah. You guys mind telling me what you're up to with all of this? - Hi, Jake, good question. What are we up to with aH of this? - These four are missing times of death. - ALLY' They're the same as all the rest. - You sure'? Down to the minute'? - Yes, I'm sure. I wrote them. And past a certain point, it really wasn't worth writing anymore. - So Christopher Manning, Alicia Townsend, Matthew Olmert. - And Rich. - Thank you. - Thank you for reading their names aloud. I was really hoping to see the faces of my dead patients again. . Okay" Look. I was piloting the red eye from LA to Newark. Big sleep hii somewhere. Somewhere over Colorado. I can't be exactly sure where, but Boulder maybe. We had a doctor in first class, good man. Tried his best. But he couldn't save them, as you know. Couldn't save my copilot either. We make an emergency landing in Denver, along with a few others. Onboard doctor records time of death, as they do. Instantaneous, he says, 3:04 a.m., adjusted for time zone. Now Denver's a shit storm, hospitals overrun, networks shutdown, mass hysteria. So we decided to press onto Newark. And when we get home, so do my passengers. But Newark's not any better. But it's good enough that I can get a coroner to take a look at the bodies. So I hand them over, sign a few forms and I'm on my way. Social media, 24-hour news, they're sounding the alarm. Only good thing come out of that, if you ask me. And they're all talking about people dying in their beds. And what time do they say it all started? - 3:00 a.m. or around 3:00 a.m. at least. - Same here. - See, and in that one little word they missed everything... because it wasn't around something or about someihing. It was exactly 3:04. But it wasn't that either, because I remember the time that the coroner reported for the victims in Newark. And what time was that'? 3206. - So people died at slightly different times. So what'? - So I decided to fly back towards Denver' short flights, just to test the theory, land, check the times of death in the hospital. And in every city it's just the slightest difference, just a small little dip in the time' D.C., 3:05. Nashville, 3:04. 3203. 3:02. Now here, 3:01. So somewhere in-between here and Denver. - Is the point of origin. - Exactly. The earliest time that we can come up with is in-between here and Denver. So this death pulse, or whatever it is, is leading me right to it. - Okay, but what is it? I mean, what exactly are you expecting to find between here and Denver'? Sleep became lethal at a global scale in a matter of seconds. And nobody, not doctors, not scientists, not anyone has a fucking due why. What' what do you think' uh, it's' uh, some kind of glitch in our evolutionary trajectory? Biological terrorism? Alien warfare? Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if we arrived at your point of origin and we found the foot of God just stomping out his creation, because that is the only explanation left. - I don't have an answer, but I do have a direction. And that direction is west. Anyway, I've wasted enough time here. I'm on the road. - Wait. We wanna come with you. Look, I've traveled alt throughout the southwest, Texas, Oklahoma, you name it. Loan get you around. - Both of you? - Yep, always. We come in pairs. Safer that way. - Fine. - All right. - Okay, I'm gonna go grab supplies and tell Jeanette we're leaving. - Yeah, hey, don't tell her why, okay. We'l\ radio them if we find anything. - Hurry UP- We still have to get actual transportation. The plane is busted. - Hey, wait. - Speak of the devil. - We're going. - No, we're fucking not. - Jake, shut up. We're going. - What is the fucking point? We almost died today. No, we've got to be safer, smarter' all right. We iust need to adapt. Just a couple more days. Like sharks, remember? Our bodies will sort out the rest. - In a few days, your body is going to die. - How the shit do you know? - Medical school. Look, the body cannot survive without sleep. Right now, you have an expiration date. We all have an expiration date' 10, 11 days max. After that, you can pop every pill on the planet but your body is going to shut down. - You don't know that. - Yes, I do. - Come on, Jake. A man's got to know his limitations. Do you know who said that? - Of course I do. ' Who? - Dirty Harry. - Dirty fucking Harry. - Yeah, okay. - All right. - All I know is sumeonsfs gotta do something or else this blueberry muffin is gonna ouflast the entire human race. - We're not gonna let that happen. Hey, Jake. Yeah. I'm scared again. - That's just 'cause you're starting to think you might actually live through this. But I'm scared too. So much for becoming sharks, right? - It's fine. I think I'd like to go back to being a person anyway. - Yep, me too. All right, you little bastard. Let's go find an answer. ♪ ?
