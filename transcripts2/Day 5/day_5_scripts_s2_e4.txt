 It's about time. Sorry, this mom brought her eight year old son in right as I was leaving. The kid had not one, not three... but two crayons lodged up his upper sinus cavity. I mean, his nose was literally running purple. And why would he do that? I don't know. I hear that magenta gets you pretty high. Anyway, come here. I got you something. I got us something. A goldfish? Alright the kid conversation is on hold.

 You don't want a dog, I do not want a cat so... A compromise fish. I thought it might make us feel more like a little family. You know? You... Me... Our weird looking baby. He's cute. It's a she. How can you tell? I can't. But I already named her so... This is Diana. Princess of Wales? Nyad. Much better swimmer. Perfect. - Babe, no not in front of the kid. - Oh, she can handle it. No seriously, though, she needs fresh water or she'll die. Right.

 Hey. Aw. Aw. Does she make you happy? - Yeah. - You liked it? Hey, Diana. Hey girl. Mmm, Oh my God. Shit! I'm right here. I can explain. It's not what it looks like. You were gonna replace her and not tell me? It is what it looks like. It's okay. You know what? It's fine. I forgive you. But only because I did the exact same thing last month. Yeah. When you went to Mary's play. And it happened last Friday too. It's a double homicide. This is my fourth. - What? - Yeah. Six fish?! Oh my god! Oh no, it's a killing spree. And you want to have a kid? No, no, no, we would be so much better with actual children. Yeah, I think we would only kill three off before we got the hang of it. But you know those three would be the lucky ones. Look, come here. I don't care how many fish we kill off or how many kids we kill off. As long as we're together. As far as I'm concerned... We're already a family. - Peanuts, pretzels? - I'm fine. You sure? I made them myself. Doesn't help your case. And for you, young lady, what can I get for you? What do you have from first class? You need to tell me what happened at the facility. About what happened to Lex. The glass shattered under my skin. Still got some pieces in me. - Abrams! - Didn't you two break up? Answer the fucking question. Jalapeno chips. Then I'll talk. Stewardess, can I get some jalapeño chips for the shiny asshole on row 9? I'm on It. We pride ourselves with service. Alright, look. After the first attack... the one that so abruptly ended our friendship, we got hit again. I guess having kids as lab rats makes you a few enemies. Whiny parents I can deal with. I've been dealing with them my entire professional life. This was something different. They were targeting the research. Autopilot is up, so... What'd I miss? The sacking of Rome. They wiped us out. Very precise. Computers, lab results, everything... all gone. And the personnel? They took out the guards first. Then they flooded the building with some kind of aerosol incapacitant. Knock-out gas. Kolokel, maybe, I dunno. The Russians have a hard-on to that shit. The ones who avoided the gas were herded towards the exits, where they were promptly shot down. It was very strategic. Surgical, even. Look, I don't know what happened to Lex, okay? Maybe she got out. But I doubt it. Eventually I had to worry about my own ass. At what point was that? Birth? Look, this may come as a shock... but you and I have the same goal. It's just one of us understands how much it's going to cost. Who were they? I don't know. Only saw one of them. Some Rambo bitch. Had a gas mask on, I only got glimpses. Blonde. Tattooed. Angry. Kind of chick Jake would bang. Who was she? Was it a boat tattoo? How did you know that? There was this woman with us. Said she was a marine sniper, went by Meredith. Except, she died... didn't she? No, she was laying right next to me. Or maybe not. She wasn't there. Your recording said three companions, but there were only two bodies. What does all this mean? If I had to guess... I'd say we've officially met the opposition. Turbulence. You said it. Hey, hey. Good morning. Wake up! Where are we? We're safe. I didn't think we'd wake up. Yes, this is Dinky-di. It's bad Australian. Just means it's the real deal. Hey. I can't believe this is real. Thanks for getting us inside. Happy to help. Besides, a few days ago, I was just like you. Exhausted. Alone. Friends and family dead with nowhere to go. Then, I just felt this power calling me to the desert. Went out and started walking. I walked miles and miles through the blazing sun. And I found nothing but sand. I couldn't take it. I collapsed. And that is when I heard it, the black spirit just whispering in my ear, "Go to sleep... just go to sleep," he said. So I laid my head down, ready... when suddenly a white chariot emerged from the sky so bright I was blinded by it. And from that chariot, a figure emerged. Was this God? An angel? I didn't know. But he looked down on me. Touched my shoulder and said, "You can sleep now." And so I did. Certain I would never wake up. But I awoke. I was safe. The Sandman saved me. Gave me his protection. I'm just glad I was able to protect you, too. Enjoying the show? Not exactly. You've got a voyeur. You, again. Look I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. I was just walking by and I heard you telling your story. It's pretty incredible. Yeah, I know. I've traveled the world the last few days. I've Seen a lot of bullshit. This is nothing like that. You're actually saving people. Yeah, well, I'm just the messenger. I know. I actually have a message. Okay. I can help you guys. Rations, necessities. I can help you source them. I can help you set up the supply lines. Get you stocked up and organized. I've worked for refugee camps for a number of years. And I can really be useful to you guys. Alright, meet me outside his tent. Thirty minutes. - Thank you. - You know what? Better make it forty-five. Where'd you learn that? Let me guess, Afghanistan or some shit. Grad school. Another place I have yet to visit. Yeah, well, you didn't miss much. In either place. Well, c'mon I'm sure you learned something useful while you were there. Yeah. How to drink. You know I'm slowly coming around to the uppers. You got the good addiction. Aw, thanks. It's not like I'm a real addict. It's more of a seasonal hobby. Oh yeah, a hobby? Well, what'd you do professionally then? I just delivered mail, packages and shit. Wait, you were a mailman? No, no, like UPS. And part time not full time. Wait, you were a part-time mailman? Did you where the little brown shorts too? Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm not some super successful yuppy journalist. Can we just appreciate the fact that we're both part of dying art forms? I can appreciate that. You know, War Correspondent is basically just Ivy League code for "functioning type A alcoholic." Move. Wakey wakey Ellis. Don't want to slip into Slumberland. Let's you and me take a ride on a roller coaster. That'd be fun. Don't be afraid. The air is always much smoother when you go down. Jim, no. No, Jim, no! - Everything okay? - Yeah. I think we're through the turbulence. I gotta take my Abrams time in doses. All assholes in moderation. Sounds like good doctorly advice. Your arm is looking pretty bad. Do you want me to change that bandage for you? No, I'm alright. Okay. A big part of me wants to turn this plane around and find Meredith. Track her down. I know the feeling. Too many trails. Gotta choose the one we're willing to die chasing. Yeah. - Here we are. - What's this? You said you wanted to be useful. Right? - Yeah. - That's what we need. Japanese Whiskey. Bottles of premium sparkling water. Buckwheat pillow. Gummy worms. It's wonderful that you can read. You'll need that. This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said "helping." Maybe if I could just talk to him and explain him... He doesn't take visitors, alright? And you'll be delivering the supplies there. What is this? Some kind of outpost or something? All will be revealed as he chooses. You can take one of the smaller perimeter trucks. There's a store about thirty minutes east. It'll have what you need. Good luck. Just going to get my shirt. At least someone has good taste in booze. I'm saving this for when I can drink again. Hmmm. May I? Not gonna lie, kind of turning me on. And here I thought I was kind of turning you on. Long flight. Still a ways to go. Gotta pass the time. Better not fall asleep. - We can't cum. - I know. Good. Cause it releases pheromones that'll put you to sleep. Yeah, actually pheromones are... never mind. - I think you're very special. - Thanks. - Harder. - Okay. - Seriously, you can't cum. - I won't. Like you can't or you don't... This isn't doing it for me. - Is there something... - No. Stop talking and fuck me. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Aww, sweet. Aww... Fuck. Oh, hell yeah. You okay? I need to get in here. Occupied. I think I'm going to be sick. Roommates. Hey, something's wrong with him! Sam? Oh, Jesus! Were you guys having sex? - No. - I got you buddy just... - Ally? - I'm sorry. I just... Something's wrong... What's happening? Oh fuck. I know exactly what's fucking happening. We're having fucking withdrawals! Ding ding! We have a winner! - Your drug. - Wasn't me. No, it's everything we stopped taking. Adderal, adrenaline, crystal, coke. Fuck we've only been here for fucking days. And my drug took you off of it. - Wait, you gave the kid coke? - Just a little. Badass. - I'm not a kid. - Sorry. Alright, what do you have left? Nothing hard. We've been taking the sleep drug the last few days. God, I can't believe I didn't think of this! This is the junkie 101. Fuck! Ally, should we take another sleep dose? They'll just have to push through it. I'm going to go talk to the pilot. - Oh, Jesus. - Alright guys, hang tight. Fucking withdrawals. I take it this is your first time smoking? Nah, but I'm trying to quit. Down to a pack a day. Does this make me look cool? Veritable James Dean. Alright, gonna be some pricks. A little makeshift acupuncture always helps with the shakes. Hurts just right. Pre-emptive strike. Isn't sharing needles bad? Banking on the kid not having aids. No, no, I'm good, thanks. It's kind of nice to not be the doctor for once. Fuck the TSA. What the hell? Good luck on the other side doll. Hey boys. Staying awake with rabies, huh? Stay, yes, stay. Okay. We can do a dose of sleep. I'll do it. You're the patient now, remember? You sure you're feeling up for it? There you go. Yeah. I'm good. - Okay. - Alright. You know, if we get through this... I may make for a good drug addict. Or a good doctor. Doctor Samuel. Say, do you trust me? You're smart enough to know that I'm more valuable alive than dead. Also, I'd haunt the fuck out of you. Do you believe in ghosts? No, but in this case, I'd make an exception. Well, I don't believe in ghosts either. It's a collaboration. One I'm going to win. - Your turn. - Oh, I'll do it. That right. You guys don't eat. Do you? You know rabies used to be called Hydrophobia? Yeah that's right boys. Even the sight of water... can induce panic. Or so we hope. Fuck you puppies. Okay. Hey. Hey. God... I keep hoping that stuff is going to get better. Makes sense he'd create a drug that somehow made this reality seem pleasant. - Should we wake him? - Right. What kind of nightmares do you think a sociopath has? Pleasant dreams? Always. Your turn buddy. Nope. Jake already got me when you all were out. Great. You need to rest. Told you, I already did. Right. Where'd you get that? I found it in the back. Still able to access the on-board movie catalogue. It's mostly old stuff. I hate airplane movies. All this "edited for content" bullshit. Cuts out all the fun stuff. Hey? Do they have the Dirty Harry movies on there? They never have the fifth one. Not even on DVD, they always leave out. The Dead Pool. Oh my god they do have it. You've seen it right? No. Dude, it's fucking awesome. Liam Neeson and Jim Carrey and one of the best car chase scenes I've ever seen in my entire life. So... Dirty Harry is being chased through the hills of San Francisco by a remote controlled toy car. Except the car has a bomb on it and it is buzzing right on his feet and right before he's about to get to... You're being a complete fucking dumb-ass, you know that? You want to survive this, right? At least I thought you did. You're being distracted and taking stupid-ass risks. When we're this close. This close to what? No one even knows if we're going to find this place. And if we don't, at least, shit we had some fun before we failed. You had some fun. Is this about you getting laid? Is that what you think this is about? Maybe? You're right, there's a good chance we don't make it. But if we don't, I'd rather spend my time with a friend. You know why Dirty Harry sucks at his job? He gets his partners killed. Goddammit. Guys look, I'm going to set it to you straight. I was hoping for flat desert, but that's not what we got. The closest road to land on is about twenty miles away. So with the fuel we got left, we got two options. Option one, land the plane safely on the road, find transportation... and spend the next few hours trying to navigate our way back. And option number two? Option two, I crash in the desert. If we survive... We'll be a fifteen minute walk from the safe sleep zone. Are you a good pilot? Doesn't matter if I'm a good pilot, crash landing is risky. But I am a good pilot. We're in day six without proper sleep. We don't have time to be navigating throughout the desert. I'm for crashing. So let me get this straight... you're considering crashing for a place that might not even exist. We'll be stranded. Sounds like we'll be fucked either way. This way we'll know sooner. I got five minutes and I got to start landing. So who's in for a hard landing? - Jake! - What? It's a vote. It's 50-50 either way. That's better odds than you gave before. It's a good point. Okay. Alright. Buckle up! Put your belt on. Have you ever been in a plane crash before? - Nope. - Cool. Always nice to experience something new together. Gets out of a first date. Okay folks, we are now making our final descent to The Sandman. I estimate arrival in five minutes and it's going to be bumpy so protect your fucking head. Unconscious is the new dead. Okay. Easy does it. We'll be fine. Ellis knows what he's doing. I guess a plane crash is a cool way to go. Yeah. Pull up! Ellis? 80 you did wanna ride the roller-coaster with me. Shut your goddamn mouth Ponoco! Aw. Don't be like that. This is the fun part. - Did we land? - Yeah. Thank you for flying Ellis Airlines. Please feel free to get the fuck off this airplane. Oh my god. Sam c'mon. Go. C'mon. We getting close? Should be. Just in time for a nice long nap. Yeah, if it's there. Don't worry, I've got a good feeling about it. Doctor, I was wondering, do you know why you hate me? I don't know. Because you murdered children? Because you tried to kill Sam? Because you're a sociopath? That's what you dislike me. I asked why you hate me. Yeah? Please enlighten me. Because blaming me for abandoning Lex is a lot easier than blaming yourself. Should be just over that ridge. What... what is it? The end. The camp moves. Hi. You made it. Yeah, well... I was in the neighborhood. Hello. Seems light. Yeah, well I ran into trouble. Like the last one you sent. What's this? It's a little something extra. Wait. The Sandman wants to see you. Well, I'm honored. Yeah, I'm sure you are. Come with me.
