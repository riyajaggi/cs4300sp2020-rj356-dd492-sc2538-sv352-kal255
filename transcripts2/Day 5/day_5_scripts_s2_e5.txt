 Just put it on your tongue and it should dissolve in a couple of minutes. Well, how long does it last? Six hours, ten, it just depends. But vision quests... Right, I mean they are supposed to last a couple of days, so... That's why there's this. You have to keep doubling your dose after it wears off so two, four, eight, blah, blah. It's a weird acid quirk. You know, Jobs, he said that doing this was one of the most important moments of his life. He said he saw his deity. His darshana.

 Yeah, well if you see Jobs' ghost out there... tell him to put the headphone jack back into my goddamn iPhone. Oh, wow! Fuck it. Holy shit. Fuck! Oh my god. Oh my god. Do not fall asleep. Do not fall asleep. This message will repeat. Come on. What the fuck? Do not fall asleep. What does that mean?! What the fuck! Help! Help! Help me please.

 Help! Help! Help me! Do not fall asleep. This message will repeat. Don't fall asleep? Fuck. Shit! Reports are coming in from around the globe... that this is an international epidemic. We've compiled a list of prescription drugs that may be abused... Modafinil, Adderall, Ritalin... Dexedrine, Digoxin. Legally, we can't recommend the use of prescription drugs without a prescription but, do what you have to do. Do not fall asleep. I repeat, this is an international pandemic. I can't sleep, I'm not supposed to sleep. It's alright, you can sleep here. Hey. You have to wake up now. Everyone who sleeps, is dead? Yup. But I'm alive. I think so. This thing is... is it everywhere? Everywhere. Listen, don't go to sleep again unless I say to alright? You won't wake up. It's you. It's you, isn't it? You are the reason I was sent out here. You are my purpose. I wasn't meant to design stupid phone apps or give some forgotten Ted Talk. No, there is only one product that matters now... life! Yeah, I guess. People need to know that you can save them. And you, you need a marketing, a PR rep... fuck, Jesus had twelve of them. But you'll only need me. Listen your followers have an expiration date okay, we have to hurry. - Hey, wait. What are you doing? - Listen, I'll be right back. - Hey, no, no, come on. - To a future in your image. Okay? Come on! Hey! Shit. Son of a bitch. I doubted too at first, But then he showed me. Showed me his power. Make no mistake, this is fertile soil and from here we will sow the seeds of our new society. It is he. The giver of sleep. The messiah of the desert. The Sandman. Is it true? May we sleep? It's true. You may sleep. To the new world. What is it? The oasis moves. How could it move? Maybe they were ambushed. The move out's to neat for that, there's no sign of panic here. That doesn't mean they weren't being chased by someone. If it migrates, then it can't be centered around a place. It could be centered around one person... Or whatever he was carrying. Well the only way to find out... follow the trail and see if we can catch up with this royal sandiness. On foot? It's not like we have any other options. Well we did have other options before y'all decided to crash land our plane in the middle of nowhere. It's not that walking ever killed anybody. There's no telling how far ahead they are. That is not entirely true. You got some kind of timer? Yeah, about 200 of them. Okay, how long? Seems to be a variance in the times of deaths, we just have to find the most recent ones. Like this guy. Rigor mortis is setting in but... it's hot which makes it difficult to estimate the times of death. What the fuck are you doing? Three hours after death the high buildup of lactic acid in the male corpse results in an irreversible priapism. Death boner. He's right. I would say judging by this sea of whiskey dicks... that the herd has about a two, two and a half hour head start on us. Although I should probably get a bigger sample. Uh, doctor if you'd be so kind as to check that pile of cocks over there. Oh, fuck yourself, Abrams. Give it another hour or so and you won't have to. Two and a half hours in cars, on this terrain... that's about a day's walk. Alright, let's try to find some clues. We are out of here in ten minutes. Ellis, we don't have a day... we better hope they stopped somewhere. This expired two years ago. How does it feel to die a loser? Wait, nope, don't answer that, hate to spoil it. Hey, find anything good? Yeah, some Adderall and a shit ton of coke. Nice. You do that really well. Do what? Search the bodies. Aw, how sweet. Yeah, I read somewhere once that you should never compliment a girl on her looks or anything she's born with. You have to compliment her on the effort she puts in and the choices she made like the kind of shoes she wears, the color she paints her kitchen, the way she clears dead bodies in an apocalypse. Well I have cleared a few dead bodies in my day, when the patrols were short-handed... just one of the perks of the job I guess. I got half off on two-day shipping, it was domestic though. What, it was still a good deal. Shit. Is that your friend from the video? Why would someone kill him? What are you doing? - What? Consoling you. - Yeah, that's what I thought. The safe sleep zone isn't looking so safe. It's got a fourteen inch aperture... And a focal ratio of F10. Which means absolutely nothing to me, but... I hope it's a ripper. Gives you something better to look at than this God forsaken place. We're all in the gutter... some of us are looking at the stars. Oscar Wilde. Yes... absolutely is. Bob. - Bob? - It's my name. It's short for Robert. Right. I'm Aiden. It's short for nothing. Great. Well thanks for all your work Aiden... alright, we know where to find you if we need anything else. Yeah well enjoy the scope, Bob, and... If you need me, you know where to find me. Yeah. You know the real purpose for a telescope don't you? It's for looking into the past. You see. Everything you see up there... it's already done. And it's been done for thousands, millions of years billions for some of the furthest stars. Crazy huh? You know what's crazy? You can use it to see the future. How's that? Margot Brown. I used to peep at her with one of those through a second story window. Two years older than the girls in my class. And damn, the future looked good. I'm not sure Einstein would agree with your assessment of space time. Well, Einstein didn't know Margot Brown. Hey look. I mean you didn't ask. But... I can help you fix this place up. By what, ogling all the women? By looking to the future. Tripp, would you boil us some water please? Yeah, of course. Hallelujah. Looks like your friend really pissed somebody off. Alright! - Nice! - Way to go Sam! Found it over the hill... don't think the previous owner's will mind. Shotgun. Nice work! What happened to that guy? We don't know. - Maybe the camp was being chased. - Maybe... We better hope they don't find us before we get there. It doesn't really matter. If something is chasing the Sandman we'll get an introduction sooner or later. You know the interesting thing about loyalty? It exists on this spectrum, right? On one end you have the fiercely loyal, the Joseph Goebbels', the HR. Haldeman's, and they will follow the boss to the very end, no matter what, even to death. On the other end, you have the traitors... the Judas', Benedict Arnolds'... your new boss... you. Both ends, they're capable of great destruction. The loyal, they're so afraid of disappointing their boss that they will hide the truth from them. And the traitors, well... the traitors will send out broadcast signals warning the public. It's alright. I know it was her idea. What I don't know is whether she has anything to do with this Sandman. She never told me. What did she tell you? Nothing. I swear. You care about what we're doing here, right? Really care? Yes. Then why? Why would you follow her? I was afraid. My mom, I hadn't seen her in years. Then I thought of her. I'm sorry. Don't be. Even traitors are necessary to the cause. What? Without you... the importance of loyalty is lost, there is no spectrum. Your death will not be in vain. I promise you that. It's gonna strengthen the resolve of every single one of us. You understand? Thank you. Sir, would you like me to locate this Oasis? It'd be my pleasure. No. I've given that task to another. What the fuck? Damn it. Good night boys. Okay, time to go. Shit. Hey, you. Cease fire, stop! Stop shooting! Stop, stop. Hey, lady. Lady? Are you there? No. We're not going to fall for that again. So. I don't want to kill you. I want to save you. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Because the first time that I saw you... I knew I loved you. You make me... so horny. And you remind me of my mom. And I like my mom. So, would you be my girlfriend? No, I'm good. You sure? Guys, I don't think she heard me. Okay. We're gonna have to go in as a group. Like the Caval-trees. We don't have horses. All I wanted is for you to be my girlfriend. I wanted to save you. All I wanted to do is to make you live mom. You sure know how to make friends. Yeah. The Three Stooges. Why the Three Stooges? It was either that or Boogie Nights. So... Probably the right choice. Yeah. It was nice. You know when we were at the bakery... she made something extra. Thought I might be able to give to Ellis in person. Yeah. He would've liked that. He just... He just missed out on a damn good blueberry muffin. It's really good. Anyway uh, Good luck Meredith. - Hey Bill? - Yup. Can you fly a plane? Sure. Why? So we're talking about basic resource management. Food and water supply lines... protection from sun for those outside the camp perimeter. Yeah, we should carve out a medical space that would allow for safe sedation of those in more extreme cases. And I suggest a place for couples to copulate. - You can't be serious. - No, it's a hygienic concern. If the sleep and the sun stroke don't wipe you out, then the sickness will. You, right now, don't even have enough water to go around. Wait until half the camp has the trots. The trots? Dysentery. And the individual sleep shifts should be shorter. Cut them in half. Pack the people in. There's a line of desperate people outside that need sleep and an hour could save them. I mean or you could extend the sleep periods all together. I can't do that. Alright, maybe we could relocate near a major city. Right now we're going in the opposite direction, there are places in Vegas that we could go and occupy. That's not gonna happen either. Are we headed somewhere Bob? Cause we can always... Listen, we go where The Sandman says we go. When he says. That's it. Well I was asking The Sandman. We're not stopping. You wanna stay here, you wanna sleep? You follow the rules. Where I say, when I say, or you don't wake up. Alright. Sorry I didn't mean to overstep... I was just trying to help. Yeah, well maybe it's time you help yourself out the door. Thanks for the telescope. It was nice to meet you Bob. Hey, sorry I suck at consoling. It's alright. I suck at mourning. I guess that's the downside of being a crazy smart... superwoman who's been to countries like Yugoslavia and shit. So before I say anything else stupid... I just wanted you to know that I'm here for you whatever that's worth. Yugoslavia is not a country. But it was. Yeah, it was. Are we there yet? I need you to talk to me. Small talk is not really my thing. What is your thing? Something? Anything. I have a cat. I did not take you for an animal person. Oh I'm not. He's a stray, crashed my back patio one night and decided to move in. Well that's a cat for you. I had one when I was a kid. Blue Bell, she was great. Not this fucker. I mean he's smart but he's a real dick. Shreds my furniture, pisses on my clothes... and his favorite thing to do is jump up on the counter... wait for me to look, and when I do... knock all my shit on the floor just to see my reaction. Well why did you keep him? I'd rather have an enemy than a friend. Friends are boring. Well, what was his name? Matthew. His name is Matthew. His name is Matthew? Do you think he's still alive? Yeah. He's alive. As long as I don't go home. What's that? Why is it beeping? That's the air pressure thing. I think. How many flight hours did you say that you had? Thirty. I'm a fast learner. You know, you asked me to take you. It's not like I need a sleep Oasis. Sorry. I just uh, God. I used to hate being around people. Oh. Yeah? You know I was really good at hiding it too, you know? Except for maybe relationships. They always know when you're pretending. Yeah. I did everything in the world to try and change who I am and it just takes a fatal disease and the end of the world to finally push you over the edge. You know like whenever you're in a foreign country and you're trying to talk to people but you can't speak the language... it's kind of like that with me all the time. I, don't really connect with people. Maybe not enough hugs when you were a kid? I wish. I don't get it. I didn't see any machines in there. No magical artifacts, just a just a bloke in a tent. Didn't seem like a god to me. Not that I have a point of reference. Well, whatever he is... The Sandman, Jesus Christ, the Wizard of Oz... he's keeping us safe. Maybe that's enough for now. He's hiding something. - No shit. - You aren't curious? - Of course. - Well then... Because he's keeping us safe. Right. Maybe I'll keep my loud mouth ideas to myself then. Stay here. Well... Looks like he liked your loud-mouth ideas after all. Yeah. What's that heart for? I'll let you guess. You know this place might survive after all. Yeah, I think so. - Let's check It out. - Yes. Hey. Come here. How may I serve, Tripp? There's another complication I need your help with. He needs your help with. Whatever I can do to keep things smooth. Look you guys, I think we're getting close. We're not close. We're just joining the other dipshits who don't know how to drive in the desert. What, was I supposed to avoid the mountain? We're not going any further in this thing. Looks like we're walking after all. Let's pack up. You have any theories on this sleep Oasis thing? Let's just say that this apocalypse is man-made. Okay. What if the people who caused it need a place to sleep too? Yeah I guess they would. You know, if you're right... we're kind of headed right into the hornet nest. Yes. I... doubt the hornets are going to be very friendly to strangers. No. Probably not. It might get a little messy. Considering how we met, I have no doubt. But technically, you're my best friend. If I die in this plane, this friendship is over. It's okay, calm down. We're just... We're almost there, I just need to find... And there it is, that's the landing gear. See? It's just like the simulator. Yeah. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Two roads diverged in a desert. Which way? Gabbi? Fuck if I know. Sam? Sam! - Where exactly are we? - Right here. Right over that ridge. Well? There is some fucked up shit down there. Define fucked up. There is a body riddled with arrows... and what I think is supposed to be a saw-you-in-half magic trick really delivered. - Are you sure you're not hallucinating? - Pretty fucking sure. Do you guys hear that? Screw the paths... I bet that plane is making a straight line to the camp. I'd bet against it. What? - We've been following the cloud. - What? In the desert there's typically not enough moisture for clouds in the day time. That is unless there's some other source of atmospheric moisture or a mass encampment of sweaty bodies. This path, leads to the cloud. - Or they're just fucking clouds. - I'm with Gabbi. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but... I'm with Doctor Evil on this one. Cloud thing, it makes sense. Well, I'm going that way. - Toward the dead bodies? - Yeah, well... if there are dead bodies, there's someone making them. He's not wrong. Are you guys seriously thinking about splitting up? That's crazy. Yes, but only temporarily. I got these out the cabin of the plane. Whoever finds the safe sleep zone first... lights up the skies. - What if they get too far away? - Don't. - That's a good plan kid. - I know. Sam! I'll keep an eye on him. Okay. Come on! We're wasting time now. Somebody's gotta go with him. Safer in pairs right? I know this whole splitting up thing is supposed to be a good idea, but I don't like it one bit. Don't worry, they'll figure out they're wrong soon enough. Come on, they'll be fine. It's a trap. What? Little lonely boy wants to see death. Your death. Shut up. And there is just one way to stop it. You've got to decide. You or him. Hey Ellis! Come on!
