 Sorry, Opie. Don't you fucking move. Not one goddamn inch. I have a different task that requires your attention. Yeah. What do you want?! We don't have anything, you fucking dicks! Fuck. - What were those? - Executions. Dammit! What the hell is going on? - What are we waiting for? - Permission.

 - Permission? - It's the rules. But... if you follow them, they'll save you. So you've slept? You won't believe me until you try it yourself first. I know I didn't. It's almost time, little guy. Just hang in there. So, they bring around a drug or medicine or... No. It's nothing like that. So, what's it like then? I couldn't begin to understand how he works. - He? - Sandman. He chooses the times. And if you obey him, you are rewarded with sleep. Where are you going? To introduce myself. You wanna come?

 I can watch him if you want. This spot is yours, you're safe here. Angel, you wait for me. Stay awake until I come back. Hey! - You got nice hair. - Thanks? Carl. Alright. So... Why'd you come to see me? We didn't come to see you? You're guys drug us in here. Oh, yeah... yeah, right. And you're all lucky we did that. We're going to save you. Like you saved the people in the other room? What people? What other room? - The ones with their heads blown out. - Oh. Yeah. No, those people weren't cured. Those people were dead. You didn't noticed they were dead? Yes. - You didn't see the blood everywhere? - Carl. Look we don't mean any harm. Whatever happened here before we got here, that's your guys business. We were just looking for an airplane on our way to the sleep zone. - Sleep zone? - Yeah. Look, I'll make you an offer: You let us go and I swear on my heart, I will give you the coordinates. I'll even fly you guys over there. And we can sleep? WOW! That's a sweet offer. But my men and I are cured. We don't need sleep anymore. What? Yeah. You see, there was this guy, Paul, Paul, and he was in the big war that everybody fought in? World War Two. No, the one before that. - World War I? - Yes! And Paul, he was there... and a bullet went right through his head and scrambled all the stuff up. And then he went home and he never slept again. Forever. You're lobotomizing people. Yes, yes, yes, that's it and sometimes it's really hard. And sometimes a gun is really messy. So we got this new guy and he is gonna help us. So when we do yours it will be way better. Carl, you don't need to do this, man. No, no, no, no. Don't worry, because even if we mess up just a little bit... It's okay, you'll still be fine, you will, just like us. Look at them, see? A-okay, USA. So, you are going to help us. We are going to make it into the books... the history books. Paul. Okay, bye. What the fuck was that? It's an incredible effort when it's actually doing what they say... - Come on, man. - I'm really sorry, mate. It's alright. You shouldn't be walking around though. The sleep is coming soon. You want to get back to your spot, so you can soak up every second. Oh, well, yeah, we're just stretching our legs until then. If you want a little something, you can sit down on our table and join in on the game. Low bid is a Red Bull. 80 you run out of adrenaline. It's a nice table. Better be, we jacked it from the Golden Nugget in Vegas. We had at a bachelor party 'cause a buddy of ours got engaged... We were there gambling and boozing when all this shit happens. So you just stayed in this casino? Yeah, everybody did when we couldn't get home. Besides, I don't know, this place had this kickass buffet... all-you-can-eat snow crab... funny company. I never saw Vegas so harmonious. We were on it together, just living for the moment. Kind of like the Summer of Love. So, yeah, we thought we'd wait the apocalypse out and see if it got any better. But, you know, it didn't and... we just kind of gave up, I guess. Decided that the Desert is a more poetic way to die than in the casino, and um... as soon as we got to this fucking awesome rock to take the big nap on... that's when we met the... you know... The Big Man. Where you from, New York? Yes, something like that. This is wild. Soon the whole world's gonna know. Yeah, sorry for interrupt. We should go. Here we go, here's to us fellows. First Disciples. I don't know, I'm thinking... maybe we distract a couple of 'em with conversation. With Jake and Gabbi to get the drop on 'em. Use their guns to get the rest. Yeah... I don't think you're gonna get much chit-chat out of these guys. I can be charming when I want to be. Ever charmed someone who was missing their frontal lobe? They've got the cognitive reasoning of a toddler. And the trigger discipline the match. Can't seem to stay out of prison... You know, you'll probably be okay. Women's brains are smaller, probably operate on you last. Kidding. Little lobotomy-prison humor for you. I was at an Iranian prison once. Guy hung himself in the cell across from me. His eyes were bugging out, just staring at me. Took 'em five days to cut him down. Just kidding. It was two days. Who's ready for a field trip? Alright you, you guys pay close attention that way you know what to do when it's your turn. I used to do all the surgeries myself. I have my own special surgical gear. Simple. I have an assistant now. I found someone to help and is real smart Einstein, come here! He's the smartest. No fucking way. Huh, I guess you guys are just stalking me now. Oh, you know them, Einstein? Know them? We're practically family. Oh, yeah, you don't look alike. What're you doing here? Yeah, you get tired of experimenting on little kids? As for the second question... no. And as for the first one... I guess I... needed a change of scenery. - Is Lex here with you? - I'm afraid not. Is she still at the facility? What did you do to her? Hey, enough talking! Einstein, start helping Burt. Show time. Woo! What I'm going to show you is a... Transorbital Lobotomy. Where the frontal lobe is penetrated via the eye socket. Enough with boring stuff. Get to the taters. - Right, the taters of brain surgery. - Yeah! Alright. How are you doing, Burt? - I'm okay. - That's good. We are going to get you fixed up in a jiffy. Now, so do I don't go probing anywhere that I shouldn't. I need you to keep talking or maybe sing a little bit. - Can you sing? - Yeah. Maybe sing the National Anthem. Can you sing the National Anthem? Sure. Alright, let's go ahead, start singing, okay? J“ 0' say can you see... J“ By the dawn's early light. J“ What so proudly we hailed. Alright, you're doing great. We're going to be done in just a sec... You're taking too long! I'll show you how to do it. Nono-no! Oh, God. There. Get up Burt. Go get us some food. I'm hungry. Holy shit. - You killed Burt. - What? You said you could do this. I can. I'm just not used to having a water-headed assistant grabbing my instruments out of my... Listen, Einstein... If you Burt anyone else... I'm taking over and I'm doing it my way. Starting with you. You're so little. You like race cars? Yeah, I guess. - Take him to office. - No. - Keep your fucking hands off of him! - Sam! Are you guys friends? Einstein, clean up the Burt. - Test him. - What? Looking for something? Ah, yeah. My wife and I got a little turned around. We're just looking for our spot. I see. Well, you better find it soon. We could be getting the blessed word to sleep any moment. He's in there? Working his magic. You have quite an oasis here. I'm Tripp. And yes, we are very proud. In time, this will be our city upon a hill. And we will be the light of the world. - Gospel of Matthew. - Somebody went to church. Strict, Catholic upbringing. Nuns and such. Yeah, I just left my bible at home in the bog actually. So, does that make you Jesus? Oh... no, no, no. No, I have way more sway than Jesus. Enjoy your stay. Shit! I'm not going to be another journalist chopped up by wackos. I'd rather die trying to escape. So, that's where I'm at. Yeah. Me too. - I'm with you. - Okay, cool. I don't actually have a plan or anything. It seems like every few minutes a couple of these guards go outside. We'll still have to take three of them, but... It's the only option. That's my car. Carl car. Cool, man. Hey, hey, don't touch that. Put that down. I just wanted to show you. Thanks, but uh... Why? 'Cause I have a preposition for you. - A preposition? - Yes. I want you... to be the general of my army. The commander of the battlefield. The tank driver extraordinaire. Oh. Get the fuck off me, you zombie fucking shitheads! - Hello, Jake. - Dr. Evil. Hard to believe... just yesterday you were threatening me with a fire extinguisher. And now here I am, preparing to scramble your brains. Life comes at you fast. Yeah, it's a real kicker. That thing Carl said... about the soldier who couldn't sleep wasn't real, right? Oh no, it was. Happened to a Hungarian solider in World War I named Paul Kern. Bullet tore through his anterior hypothalamus. Pow! Couldn't sleep for forty years. And you're gonna perfect the method? No. What happened to Carl and his band of cretins was dumb luck. Literally. They probably won't survive the week. Dude, I'm sure you hear this all the time... but you fucking suck. Holy shit! This is awesome. How does it do that? What? Show us. Nope. Sorry. Show us! Show us now. Guys, this is too good to show. Show us. We want to see too. Once I'm sworn in and I take my oath... then... I will give you... the keys. - So I can open up the Pentagon? - Yes! Shouldn't you get one of your men to be a general? No! My men are old. They just think with their nuggets. And you're young and you'll only blow up what I want you to blow up. Like Florida. Plus, you and me could be friends. Uh, Carl... You don't like that? It's a kind of hard to agree with you when you have my friend on a chopping block. It's not chopping block. It's poking. - It's murder. - Nobody's murdering. He's going to live, like us. And you are, too. Look, man, get this through whatever brain you have left... I don't want to be a part of your dumb-ass presidency, And I sure as hell don't want to be your friend... So let me go. You should've said yes. Jake, I'm going to need you to sing the national anthem. Fuck.You. If you don't want me to go too far. You sing. - I pledge allegiance, to the flag... - Funny guy. Oh, my God please don't do this. Please don't do this. Hey, If you pay attention, I'll let you do the other eye. What!? You need to take it slow. No rushing this thing. J“ Oh say can you see... Now, when you are about five centimeters in, J“ By the dawn's early light. You start to feel the frontal lobe resist a little bit. Please, please don't do this! Please! If you look in there, you can see his the brain. Why? I may suck... but I know an opportunity when it presents itself. We'll see if you make it. I'm going after Sam. I suppose I'll get the others. Stop moving... You're making my brain hurt. No way, psycho. I'm not a psycho. I just wanna stab you. Just one time. And you can even pick where. - Come closer and I break it. - No, you won't. Oh! Oh! Hey! You son of a... No, no, not my picture. That's my car. Put the knife down. Okay. - Sam! Get the fuck away from him. - Who are you? I'm the guy you just sent to get his brain mashed up. Why'd I do that? Because your fucking crazy you dickhead. I'm not crazy! Son of a...! They need to come with me. I'm finished with their friend. - What? - Yeah! The last procedure was a big success. We're all are going to live forever. Yay! Starting with you. Let me explain! Stop playing with Einstein! Wait! I'm trying to get us out of here! You lovebirds done? C'mon, let's go. Won't take them long to investigate. Hey, Jake! How's your brain? No new damage. Are you okay? - Fine for now. - Alright, I got point. So much for this way. Sam and I looked everywhere, it's all blocked. You think these guys got bad memory, too? In theory, yeah. No, no, he's right. That Carl dude didn't even recognize me the second time I saw him. So you got a forgettable face. Ah? Stop! You're not going! Carl, you don't want to do this, man. Oh, yes I do. You guys suck. I know, I get it. We suck and you wanna blow us all to space. But I'm tellin' you, you don't wanna do this man. Why? 'Cause that's a EMF-40 “m your hand. The rocket inside needs to travel at least 100 yards before it arms. That's why you gonna to get yourself some distance. How do I do that? Do you see that light pole out there? Now, you run out there to that, and then you turn and fire on us. Then It'll blow up, just like you like. Alright. You stay here, stay here. Over there. I guess we owe you a thanks... for saving us. Saving you is incidental. You didn't go there on purpose? No, I didn't join a gang of lobotomized psychotics on purpose. I was looking for a lab to work in when they caught me. What happened to the one in Austin? - It's gone. - What do you mean gone? Destroyed. Sayonara. I need your help Ally. It's gonna take another sharp eye to help me do the checklist for this bird. Yeah, I'm with you. On behalf of Ellis Airlines... this is your captain Ellis speaking... I'd like to welcome you all aboard the direct flight... to the Sandman's Oasis. Flight time... is roughly three hours, But I'm not gonna adhere to FAA rules, so... I'm gonna try to shave at least thirty minutes off. 80 seat back, relax... put your tray tables down, if you so you desire. And light them up if you got them. Einstein! What's wrong? Cuando la limosna es grande hasta el santo desconfía. Yeah, what does that mean? It means when someone gives too much charity... even the saint is suspicious. You think this is too good to be true. Yeah. Hello, hello, everyone! It is now safe to sleep. The sweetest dreams to you and yours. - I love you. - I love you mommy. You are going to lay down here. You are going to close your eyes. Close your eyes. Goodnight, Aidan. Goodnight, Paula.
