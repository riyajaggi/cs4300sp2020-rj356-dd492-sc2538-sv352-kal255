 And the little boy looked everywhere for the trail, but he was lost. - Then he heard a sound. - Maaaaaroof! - El Cadejo! - Si. And the boy turned around and there he was... part goat, part dog, and shining bright like the moon. And El Cadejo led the boy home, and his mama made him dinner. It's Ok. Remember the nighttime rules? Don't go near the windows and don't open the door for anybody. That's right.

 Can you sleep now? I love you. Bed time. Lay down. Get comfy. Let's get comfy. I love you. [Speaks Spanish] Go to sleep. - Hey! - Thank goodness! We had such good tummy time earlier but now he just won't go down. - He's on his back? - Yes. - He was breathing OK? - Yes. I don't know how you do it. I think sometimes that he waits for you to come to fall asleep. No. He just wants to fall asleep on his own. - He would get more rest... - No, I wish it were that simple.

 Any little thing can go wrong. We did everything right with Oliver... All the books, the special yoga classes. He hit every milestone... and still... To find your own son blue in his crib. Lifeless. You can't imagine what that's like. 80... Your son is at home with your husband? Yes. That must be nice. Jack practically lives in Beijing these days. I promised I wouldn't check that after bedtime. Oh no. No. No. No. It's Ok. Paula, put on that 'Baby Beluga' video. Maybe that will help. This is a National Emergency. Important details will follow. Do not fall asleep. Do not fall asleep. What is this? This message will repeat. - I gotta go! - No, where... Where are you going? Don't leave! Paula! This is a National Emergency. Important details will follow. You didn't listen to me. Thank you... Thank you baby. Thank you. Easy! We need drugs... whatever you have... I'll shoot. Keep your hands up. Look it's... It's special mix. It's probably not the best for... Yeah, kids. You're well-traveled, aren't you? Maybe not as far as me, but far. Not many bullets left either. It's been a busy week. Look, I have something that'll be good for him. I'm going to get it now. Ok? Buzz Fuzz Sour Sherbet. One of my favorites when I was your age. Of course it didn't have cocaine back then. I mean... If we have to stay awake, it might as well taste good. Right? Is that the Oasis? I think it is. Yeah. How did you hear about it? My cousin. She lives a few hours east of here. She waited for us to go together. - Is she with you? - No. At least you still have family. It's more than most of us can say. Shall we? Here, I'll take that, thank you. Wait here. It's been 20 minutes, you gotta drive faster, Ally. Come on! Drive faster where, Jake? God, I'm getting so fucking tired of chasing people down. Yes, that's a dig at you, Ellis. Noted. - You alright? - I've Seen better days! I'm a super attractive war reporter chick. Where do I catch a nap? Jake... I feel like we are starting to waste our time. If we can just get to the airfield. I'm sure I can crack it. Well, I'm not sure, alright, Sam?! - Right here! Right here! Right here! - Ok. Ok. Nope. Okay, onward ho. Jake, I think Sam's right. We don't know what car she's in or what direction she went. We could've just gone miles in the wrong direction for all we know. Not to mention she stole our drugs. I think it might be time to cut our losses. Can you just, pull up a little bit please? I just don't want to have a serious talk with a rotting corpse in my face, if you don't mind, thanks. - Better? - Better. Look... We're already gonna lose another 15 minutes going all the way back across town to the base. What if we're chasing someone who never ran? If you're crashing, need a fix. You are not gonna hop in a car and risk falling asleep behind the wheel, you're gonna find somewhere to hunker down, somewhere safe, somewhere nearby. You don't find a comfy bed in the middle of a war zone, right? You drop off to the side to regenerate your shield. Like in Call of Duty. Yes! Exactly. She's regenerating her shield. What the fuck does any of that mean? Look, we're going back across town anyway, just... Let's go back to the site and I'll shut up. Ok! Ok. By the way, regenerating shields are bullshit. Back in my day, we had health packs. Like men. Blow me. Wait! Angel has to pee. Ok! Don't tell anyone about this. Ok? - Success? - Yeah. No one is sleeping. Maybe inside. Stamps? We're looking for the Sandman's Oasis. You and everyone else. Do you have your stamps or not? - No. - We just need to sleep. You need a stamp then maybe you can get some sleep. Alright, but it's true then... you can sleep here? Just get in line. We're not gonna find her! Found her! Ok, I guess you do go find a bed in the middle of a war zone. Yep. - Cutting it close. - I've got this. Isn't she supposed to? Holy fuck! Good morning. This your ride? We helped ourselves. Didn't think you'd mind. You remember when you almost murdered me? Hey, remember when you stole our shit? Sorry, kid. I just... tend to work better alone. Only-Child Syndrome. I do like dogs, though. What kind of dogs? I don't really like dogs. Ok? I'm just trying to sound more personable. Well, be grateful we found you. Thirty more seconds and you weren't coming back. - Then I owe you a thanks. - Thank Jake. Anytime. Look, I do appreciate not being dead but, honestly guys, this magic place you're looking for... it isn't real. None of them have been real. Well. It's the only place we've got. Right new. And you have to take us there. - Is that right? - Yep. You owe us a Wookie life debt. A what? You're Chewbacca and we're Han Solo. We just saved your life, outside the movies. So now you have to help us get to the far reaches of the galaxy. Well... when you put It that way... Let's go find a rocket ship. I'll try and patch in as soon as we're in range. - Nice stick. - What? Sleep drug. You hit a solid vein. You weren't too bad yourself. It's almost like you had some practice. What do you call your little drug? It doesn't really have a name. It must've taken some work, yeah? The world's lucky to have people like you left to develop this kind of shit. Yeah. Real lucky. Ally, left! Ally! Left! Sorry. - You want me to drive? - I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm just... yeah. Yeah. - These people need aid. - What? I used to work for the UN a while back. Crisis management. Camps like this, they're a delicate thing. You need good site management, hygiene. Without a good local host or a proper supply line, you get this. So? So the people inside are dealing with a crisis they don't know how to handle. People keep showing up anyway. This means we need to be cautious. Which you already knew, so... I guess, I just wasted a minute of your life. Did your "crisis management" work for this at home? No. Too many people awake. Not enough supplies. Saw downtown Sydney teared itself apart at zero hour. In 24 hours, the drug lords were more powerful than the prime minister. It was something else. You obviously haven't been to Honduras. Yeah. Obviously not. Anything? I'm getting nothing. We'll have to hardline in. Let me swap the battery. That fucking drug, man... It's... Intense, huh? What was yours about? Nobody actually likes hearing about other people's dreams. Even when they're trying to hit on someone. I mean... sometimes you can have both. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. You do know how out of your league I am, right? I am so immensely aware. Alright. I was... in a city. Somewhere hot. Chaotic. Khartoum, maybe. Khartoum. Yep. There was this... tiger... stalking me through the city. Yeah. Khartoum has a real tiger problem, for sure. I finally turned and confronted it. I had this sword and I was just hacking at this thing, but it was all claws and teeth. I finally killed it though. It was brutal. It was covered in blood and so was I. Whoa. But when I finally went to look at the body, I realized it was a girl. And she was pregnant. And I reached down to feel her belly. I could still feel the cub kicking inside. Well, I'm glad you're alive. I am sorry I stole your drugs. That was stupid. It's usually someone else who almost gets me killed. Six days, no sleep. Nobody's perfect, trust me I know. And I'm sorry I scared you when you woke up. I'd already forgotten that. I hadn't. Well... then I guess we're even? Minus your Wookie life debt, yeah. Obviously. Hey, come on! People were here when 3 AM hit. Yeah, there's always someone manning CO or something. Or maybe they were out in the field training. Better safe than dead. Let's make this quick. Hey! Bingo. I can't do this with ya'll watching. That was supposed to be a joke guys. It's gonna take a second. Nice girlfriend, idiot. You think it's too early to ask her to marry me? Should I ask her dad? He's probably dead. - Do you think Carmen is still alive? - Yeah, I bet she is. - Do you think I'll ever see her again? - Yes, of course you will. Don't start doing that. Don't start treating me like a kid. Alright. Alright... It's hard to know if you'll see her again. There are plenty of other fish in the sea. - Not really. - Well, yeah, sure there are. Like earlier today, when met Gabbi, even though she had that gun at me I just knew it was going to be Ok. You know what I mean? Well, either way, we're headed to the sleep zone there'll be lots of hotties for a guy like you. Whatever. Alright. I guess I'll just go guard the end of the hallway. Do you mind if I...? Yes, sure. Thanks. I'm melting out here. How long have you been waiting for? Two days, total. I've done this line four times and haven't gotten in once. You haven't gotten in? It's hard to get in. Used to be easier, I hear, but... Now they just tell you, come back in a few hours, come back in a few hours... Do you know what it was that they found in there? You just have to be inside. And it will protect you. That's cute kid you got there. I had one of those. - I'm sorry... - Don't worry. She wasn't mine. She was my sister's kid. Man... she was a good sister, let me tell you. Why don't you settle down like your sister Janis? Have a couple kids. Give up the Four Lokos for a nice Chardonnay after dinner? Get your real estate license like your sister. Anyway, guess who was up playing online poker at 3 AM and guess who was safe at home, in bed with her Church-Praise-Band-Leading husband? But the kid was a little shitbird. Just like her aunt. Up causing trouble. She was seventeen. Too old to get us inside here, but... you know. Some people thought that if you sleep close enough to the camp, that you'd be fine. That you'll absorb it's power somehow. But it knows if you do that. And it will not protect you. If you sleep outside, you die. Looks like I'm next! Stay awake little man, stay awake. 115.42... Mike? Okay. I think I've got something! I'm Michael White reporting here, live from... behind me there's a camp site. At... 115.428° West. These people behind me are sleeping. I know you can't quite hear it. These people are breathing. They have a pulse. I think she might be waking up. Holy shit. It's real. I'm gonna try to get some rest. Check in again, when I wake up... White... Signing off. You know him. Michael. Yeah. I know him. Better than his wife does, for sure. Well, maybe is just a hoax. This guy didn't have weak hunches. If he says it's there, then it's there. That's the last one he sent. Less than 24 hours ago. Well... looks like I'm eating crow. You guys were right. Those were some sleeping people, all right. Now I just need to... What the fuck...? Something must have went wrong with the upload. There's no location signature. Go back to the video, again. Stop. 115.428° West. That's half of it. What direction was he going in? - Right. - His last report was in Idaho. Twin Falls then Sun Valley. So he's heading south. So, if we just follow his longitude South. Then, we just need to know where he stopped. 115.428° West These people behind me are sleeping. Come on, Mike. I think I'm going to try to get some rest. I'll checking again when I wake up. Where are you? Good afternoon, Ma'am. Will you be joining our great experiment of community? I've been here two days. Ya'll told me to try again today. - Any family? - Just Janice. Alright. Single Adult. You're in luck. We've got a shift for you in just 34 hours. You're doing shifts now?! In 34 hours I'm gonna be dead! You will be in moon group. Next, please. We need to sleep. Now. Right now, it's approximately 24-34 hours on our wait list. But I can get you a nice couples tent when your shift comes up. No, no, no. That's not good enough. The kid... He needs to sleep now. I'm sorry, Why didn't you mention you had a child? All children are welcome here. We are building the future after all! I'll get you a nice family tent right away... Family of three. Yes, of course. All set. You can come and go as you wish. This last part is very important. Do not go to sleep until you hear the signal. Before that... We can't guarantee the quality of your experience here. Hold on. There are no guns here. As you can see this is a powerful place, but it's also a place of rest, renewal, rejuvenation. Re-imagination. May I? He's scared. I understand. Simply just a precaution. - All good. - Perfect. Family Tents are on the East Side. You'll be in tent number 82. - What the fuck? This is bullshit. - Yeah! Relax! - Now we have to wait. - We'll wait. Just a little longer. Come here. Sit down. Stay awake. Ok? We came from Honduras three years ago. Just me and Angel. He was so little then. Five days on the top of La Bestia. It's a train from Honduras through Mexico. Some people got off along the way. There were some women who gave us some water, some Mesa, So many people were robbed. Or worse. I saw a woman my age fall asleep. She slipped right off. Fell right under the wheels. We didn't stop. It was just like now: You sleep, you die. Yeah. These people... They don't know how to survive. Someone needs to teach them. Quick, play that video one more time. I know if you can quite tell here, but... These people are breathing... They have a pulse. I think she might be waking up. That's pretty much everything south of Idaho. I know where that is. Where? Well, I don't know exactly where it is. My dad took me there once, in the summer. We drove. We couldn't afford to fly. I think it was his excuse to go to Vegas. He'd plop me at one of those fancy buffets while he'd go play Texas Hold'em. And he was good. Sometimes he'd even split the winnings with me. And he did really well that summer. 80 then... the trip continued. It's somewhere West. Like a Canyon or something. - Not the Grand Canyon... - It's Leelan Canyon. - Yeah, that's it. - How did you know that? It's... in the behind the scenes DVD for Jurassic Park. Let's hope their park security doesn't have a glitch in their system. Leelan canyon is a match. Now we just need a ride. I'm on that. - You gonna take one of these? - No. This hangar is some kind of museum. These are old warbirds. We could take one but we'd be slow. Stylish... but slow. You ok? That's a P-51 Mustang. Not many of these left. 1942... Helped defeat Germany's Luftwaffe. Win the war. Flew higher and further than any other combat aircraft. They called it "the plane that could go all the way." - Glad you're back to us. - That's because you need a pilot. It's because I like having you around. Can never have too many smart people with your back. These last few days, we had... We had leads, but not a lot of hope. Somehow... this feels different. Yeah, it does. Maybe we reached a turning point. Alright. Let's go find a real plane. All planes is mine! I'm not kidding, they don't call me "Jake the snake" for nothing. No one called you that. - What the hell was that? - Shit! - Sam? - Shit! Sam? Hey! Hey!
