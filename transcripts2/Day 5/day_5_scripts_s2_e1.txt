 Good morning! We've been waiting for you several days now. We... thought something awful might have happened... You don't have to worry about me, Terence. Oh! But you are one of the Seven. I mean, we”... What future do we have without you? By that math? A future with just Six, I guess. Hi! What's it like out there? We were told they'd be cleansed after the fifth day, but we're still seeing them. People don't like confronting death...

 They get a little rambunctious. Wait you're, seeing them? Is everyone still inside? Yes, of course. I only meant outside the windows. Okay. 80... Have we done well? Have we earned our place in the Ark? You have done so well. But I'm afraid that ship has sailed. Always rambunctious. Perfect! Do you know how hard it is to find a good pilot these days? I can't hear you! Do you how hard it is to find a good pilot these days? I suppose it would be tough to find any pilot.

 Exactly! - What are you doing? - I've found another one. Do we need another one? It can't hurt. You know planes have two pilots, right? In case one dies. Move! Sorry for this but... you guys are the difference between two hours to Jacksonville and 20. What's in Jacksonville? Wife? Kids? Favorite uncle? - Our sister. - Shut up, Ez! Just get us in the goddamn air! Look, if you really wanted to help her, you'll let us go. There are bigger things at stake here. What if he's right, Vinny? What if... What if I grow feathers and I start shitting eggs? Just shut up and let me handle this, alright? Jesus! Alright, Come on! Let's keep it moving! Come on! Don't! By the smell of you, you'll burn us all up. Don't worry, I've muted the mic. Aidan. Ellis. How's it feel to be a commodity? Isn't that why we learned how to fly? To feel special? Oh wait, no, I know, it was... It was for the women. Definitely the women. No matter what happens we've got to get this plane headed west. That's where all the answers are. They're not going to know the difference until we hit the ground. Yeah, and when they do... Pretty sure the little angry one will shoot us out of spite. There's another way, my friend. Another way? Bracing ourselves. Statistically speaking... the cockpit is the worst place to be in a plane crash. Oh, my God! Oh, Fuck! Hey! Anybody awake? I'll take that... You know, a couple of days ago... they would have just been unconscious. But... Unconscious is... the new dead. They were just trying to see their family... I'll put 'em on my tab. Well, we can't stand around here crying. We gotta find new rides. Come on. So you're following the bodies west, eh? Made it out west myself. Out to the Frontier, like... like cowboys. If we're both going west, why don't we... carpool or plane-pool or whatever the shit you call it. Well... We're headed the same direction but not looking for the same thing. I'm looking for a nice quiet place to sleep. You gotta be kidding me, right? I don't suppose you have not heard of the. "Sandman's Oasis". It's the newest of them. Rumors of a... Safe Sleep Zone. - Rumors? - Well, reports, technically. On the AP wire. A little inconsistent, save for the one detail that they say, you can sleep there. Anyway, those rumors, they... They got me out of Sydney. Sixteen hours later, I touched down in Madagascar. This little town called Toamasina. But all I found there... were bodies. As far as you could see. Rows of corpses just lying there, on the sidewalks, on the streets, Even on the beach. Right down to the water. And everything... was dead. Except the sharks. Hammerheads... they'd come in at high tide for a surprise feast. They really believed someone would save them. Why? Maybe they were just desperate. Yeah. Maybe. You know, it just... it just felt like there was something there. I'm gonna just stick with science. Well, your loss. I'm gonna be snoozing at the Oasis before you know it. Well there's always an open invite if you get bored... or if you just decide a myth's just more fun. Stay awake, Aidan. You too. Stay awake, Ellis. I did hear one interesting rumor though... Some place that was somehow unaffected... Safe sleep zone... Rumors about a safe sleep zone... They really believe... Someone would save them. Why? Stay awake Ellis... Seemed like there was something to it. Stay awake Ellis. Really believed that I could fix this. Sun will be out soon. Least I got three companions to share it with. Goodnight, guys. What are you doing? Looking for Ellis. Why would he be under the bed? You wouldn't believe the shit I've found under my bed. Doesn't make any sense. Unless he found something. Right? I mean, you just take the time... to record a suicide note and then up and leave, unless you find something. It's pretty rude. Well, he could have all the answers on the planet, but... he's not here. Come on! Get up! Get up Jake! That came on quick. Yeah, get some air, huh? Alright? - We got sleep, right? - Yeah, yeah. We got 10 minutes of awful sleep. And it's too early for another dose of the drug. Even without that, we should be able to go another four or five days, right? In controlled, clinical settings, yes. But running around, slamming drugs, dodging psychos... It's pretty safe to say we're working on a different spectrum here. How long of a spectrum are we talking? As long as we can. But we need to be extra careful how we exert ourselves going forward. Well, I already feel like shit, and Sam looks like he's aged a year in the last hour. We should eat. Regain some strength. Then we'll figure out how to find him. These stayed fresh! We missed CatCon. I did not realize... there was a demand for cat conventions. Eight years' worth. And that's just the Southwest edition. We were just begging for an apocalypse, weren't we? Oh Cool. This cat can meow like Bob Dylan... Call me when one can do a decent Axl Rose. I can smell the guests. Hey, what do you think smells worse, the people or the cats? There's a pussy joke in there somewhere, I know it. Hey! Hey! You alright? As alright as I'm gonna be. I think. No, I mean... Look, I hate to be the one to say it, but... You think it's time to consider going back to Dr. Evil's lair? If we can't find Ellis, at least there we stand a chance. Maybe with all the creepy bald dudes and the gun fire, and the experimenting on children, your girlfriend pulling a gun on us, it might not seem an ideal place, but... Nope. Never mind, I just talked myself out of it. We'll go back. When we find something better. For now... let's just find Ellis. Relationships are tough. It's just a joke. Blood. Fuck! No, this isn't where the trail... ends, this is where it begins. Oh shit! It's one of those things, isn't it? What did the Padre call them? Introverts? Incubus. A sleep demon. A male one at least. A female would be called a Succubus. I dated one of those once. Sucked my bank account dry. You had money once? No. Come to think of it, She wasn't a very good succubus. Is it still inside the building? I don't think so. We better find out before something else does. It's time, Captain. I'm sorry? It's time to prepare for your landing. I'll take that for you. Come on... Come on, Ellis... Come on... You see? You didn't have to be worried about me, or not in the sense that you were saying that you were... - Please! - It's... They said we would be taken! I did everything they told us to do! I know... l know... Don't take it personally. It's... Sweet dreams. What are you doing? I was just dismantling the place. I gave you that order three days ago. I know. I was investigating. You know that Emergency Broadcast signal. How did it go out so quickly after everything started? It was the traitor! She knew that she couldn't stop it so she did the next best thing, and she tried to warn everybody. I even got her name and... You already know. I gave you a simple task. And yet, here we are. Three days later? What were you doing instead? Hunting. Do I not provide for your passion? You do. Then why isn't that enough? Why is this task outstanding? You know... I've always enjoyed your spark. But when you disobey, what choice do you give me? No! Please! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please! Please! Please! I forgive you. I'm gonna make it up to you. I'm gonna wipe this place out, and then I'm gonna find that sabotaging bitch for you... You will do none of those things. I have a different task that requires your attention. Go! Thank you! Thank you master! I know I am stained. I know that I deserve to die. But... Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This is an international epidemic. Do not fall asleep. Hey! "Seatbelt" sign is on. Ellis! Ellis! Ellis! Ellis! Ellis! Jim? Jim! Where to, boss? You know where... The Sandman's oasis. Oh, that's... not on today's flight path. Why didn't you check the reports? You could've done it at the news station before you shut it down. Why didn't you? Fuck! I was so focused on that fucking signal. I can't keep anything straight. Yeah, I guess we're all allowed to be fucking idiots every now and again. You have to get us there. Who says I'm not already there? I'm sure as fuck not here, am I? Look, why don't you take a load off? Mm? I'm at the helm. You're bleeding all over first class. Just nod off. I have to stay awake. I have too. Yeah. It's understandable. - What's that? - Come on! You know what... If you're going to survive this, you're gonna have to head into the storm. What the fuck? Shit! Come on! Every asshole will be here in a minute. Oh! Fuck! You just wait her out, big guy. Fuck off, Ponoko. All you little moths, coming to the big fire. That a boy! Kill the bitch! Put her out of her misery! Kill the bitch! Kill her! Kill her before she can seduce you. Get the fuck off me! Don't you listen to her! That's her siren's song. You didn't kill her! Well... No prize for second place. Holy shit! Found Ellis. Are you alright? Sorry about him. I'm Jake. Are you serious? - Let me... - Hey! Back! Back! Back! Back! Fuck! Just leave me the fuck alone. Oh, shit! There won't be anything left! Fuck! Real smooth. Hey! Get over here, he's bleeding out. Welcome back to the land of the living. Is that what this is? - Hey! - Hey! Hey! You guys made it. Yeah. I'm guessing... You just saved my life. It's a good guess. Come on. So, you saved the world, yet? No. Not yet. Sorry. You find your cure yet? Not yet. Sorry. There... was a woman. Did... did... did I? No, no. She's fine. She's totally fine. They fucking poured acid on their drives! I think she's having a bad day or something. Goddamn it! Fuck you! Fuck you, motherfuckers! - Goddamn it! - Oh, Goddamn it! Goddamn it! This was it. This was it. - This was What? - Shit! Double fuck you! God... Hey! Take another step, psycho, and you're gonna eat a bullet. Look... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I'm sorry! I didn't know... This is the point of origin, right? What did I say? Hey! It's me again. I'm Jake. In case you forgot. Right, okay. We're all friends here. No need for a gun. Thank you. - I'm Gabbi. - This is Ellis. He's not a psychopath, normally. That's what the neighbors say when they find a dozen dead bodies next door. - What? - Serial killers. John Wayne Gacy. I love John Wayne. "Young fella, if you're looking for trouble, I can surely accommodate ya." It's from "True Grit." Jesus Christ! Hey! Please! - I have to know. - Yes. Yes, you're standing in Ground Zero of the Sleep Apocalypse. You happy? Alright... Look, you guys actually want to help? - Yeah. - Look for a back-up. Any back-up! A working drive, a cell phone, a fucking sticky note at this point. Five fucking minutes. Five minutes and it could've told me everything. Might have been able to recover something from the fire too if I wasn't, you know, being strangled. I am sorry. But it looks like, this was all destroyed before the detonation. Yeah. Actually, I think you're right. But It doesn't mean I'm not placed. Psycho. You knew it was this building? I knew it was these coordinates. I'd traced it back from times of death. How? I had nine but it only got me as far as Dallas. Hmm, that's cute. I cross-referenced 137 reports across the globe. You some kind of reporter? Sort of. I was a war whore. - I'm sorry, a what? - An imbedded war journalist. Six days ago... I was getting shelled at in Syria. Now, I am here. Lucky me. Jesus! Thorough little bastards, weren't they? I don't understand. Why murder these people? Why not just let sleep kill them like everyone else? What if sleep couldn't kill them. I mean, What if they're immune? What? Five minutes ago and maybe I could've told you, an act of God, a magic serum... But now I can't tell you shit. Except for what you already know. Which is that we're probably all about to die. So, when did you get here? This morning. I got here last night. So you're five minutes, was 12 hours for me. I was six blocks away. I couldn't find it. People die for six fucking blocks... Don't sweat it. People have gotten really good at dying lately. Way better than they used to be. And trust me, they used to be really good at it, so... I wish I could have seen those reports. Yeah well, there's no way you would have... they were unpublished. I got them off the AP Wire. You got them off the AP Wire? Yeah. They were just half-drafts though. Nothing broadcasted. Did you hear anything about a "Sandman"? Not that I recall. Fuck it, here. - What is it? - I don't know. Looks familiar. I can't place it. Maybe it's from the future. Like when they find that chip in The Terminator. Does that make you John Conner? Yes, but only from the James Cameron ones. When we wasn't a giant pussy. Fair enough. Alright, what is it that you know about this Mr. "Sandman"? Or is it Mrs.? Not much. I don't even know If It's a person. Just heard... it's a place you could possibly sleep. Yeah. Plenty of that bullshit going around. What are all these dots? The colored ones? The bullshit. Reports of Safe Sleep Zones... - What do these reports say? - All sorts of shit. This one is potato farmer in Idaho who fell off a tractor on day one and woke up with a headache on day three. This little blip in Utah is a polygamist ranch where the prophet claims his entire family was sleeping safely through the power of prayer. All dead now, of course. - And Madagascar? - Oh, yep, yep. That was an early one. Also bullshit. Well... sorry. No "Sandman". Could be a newer one, but without a secure connection, I can't look up shit. This place is a dead end. What do you say to chasing a desperate myth instead? Yeah. Desperate can be fun, I guess. And I wouldn't mind trying out whatever your friends have in those syringes either. What do you propose, psycho? There's an air force base on the outskirts of town. I'm sure it still has working generators. Think you can connect to AP Wire from there? Probably. Then that's what we'll do. Something is missing here. I got that gnawing feeling like it's right in front of us. One more sweep. Then I'll give you my answer. Yes. Snacks. Raisins. This is the apocalypse. Hey! You guys don't have to come with me. You know that. I know. But we are coming with you anyway. But if we are gonna go, we should actually go, because. This place is toast and I don't even know what we're looking for. Must have forgotten to zip this I guess... I had more of these when we left the hotel. Shit! Where's Gabbi? She must have swiped when we were inside. Shit! I'd just like to point out, it's not like she took all the drugs, which I think is somewhat respectful. We got enough to go on? Yeah, we'll be okay, but... shit. Would you stop saying shit and tell us what's wrong? She stole the sleep serum but not the wake up syringes. Not that she could self-administer anyways but, If she takes the drug. She's not waking up. Shit! We gotta go find her. Can't we just get to this base and find the Wire on our own? - Who knows how to do that? You? - I can figure out. Come on, Jake! She already stole from us. Spoiler alert Sam. People have stolen drugs from me my entire life. Come on! Look, all I'm saying is, if it comes down to it, I can figure out the system. If we're gonna find this place, we're gonna need her. If this "Sandman" place exists, we gotta be smart. Use all the resources we have. We've got ten minutes once she takes the drug. That's it. We find her, we find the safe zone. We get to sleep. If it exists. If it exists. It does. It has to...
