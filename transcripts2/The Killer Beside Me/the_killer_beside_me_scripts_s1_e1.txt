 MORNING. ♪♪ Jim: IN THE SUMMER OF 2015, CAROLINE WAS 24 YEARS OLD. SHE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FOR A LOCAL GROCERY-STORE CHAIN. - HI. - HI. SHE WORKED IN THE PRODUCE SECTION. SHE WAS THE ASSISTANT PRODUCE MANAGER. SHE WAS VERY GOOD AT HER JOB. YOU'RE WELCOME. HAVE A NICE DAY. CAROLINE REALLY LIKED THE CAMARADERIE OF PEOPLE SHE WORKED WITH, AND SHE MADE NEW FRIENDS. HEY. IN THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER OF 2015, I STARTED AT THE GROCERY STORE, AND THAT'S WHERE I MET CAROLINE. OH! I FINALLY STARTED THAT BOOK YOU LENT ME. AH! AND? CAROLINE WAS JUST -- [CHUCKLES] SHE WAS REALLY BUBBLY AND REALLY FRIENDLY, JUST SOMEBODY THAT I INSTANTLY WANTED TO GET TO KNOW MORE. ♪♪ SHE WAS VERY WELCOMING. AS PEOPLE WOULD ENTER THE STORE AS EMPLOYEES, NEW HIRES, SHE WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL AS THOUGH THEY BELONGED A PART OF THE GROUP, WHICH IS WHAT SHE DID WITH ME. SHE CARED FOR EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU WERE. ANYWAY, I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE. OKAY. OH! NEW GUY. ♪♪ Jim: NOT LONG AFTER STARTING AT THE GROCERY STORE, CAROLINE MET A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF CHRISTOPHER O'KROLEY. ♪♪ I'M CAROLINE. HI. UM, CHRIS. ♪♪ Brooks: CHRIS GAVE OFF A SORT OF VIBE THAT TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO REALLY SEE INSIDE OF HIS HEAD. HE WAS VERY QUIET, SOMEWHAT SECLUDED, FRIENDLY ENOUGH, BUT REALLY JUST TO HIMSELF MOST OF THE TIME. UH, I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE? RIGHT. ♪♪ THE STORE WAS A REALLY VERY SOCIAL PLACE. I WORKED IN THE SMOOTHIE BAR, WHICH WAS PART OF THE PRODUCE DEPARTMENT WHERE CAROLINE WORKED, AND THEN CHRIS WORKED IN THE MEAT DEPARTMENT. YEAH, IF YOU GO OUT THERE AND TURN RIGHT, IT'S OUT THE DOOR ON YOUR LEFT. EVERYBODY REALLY GOT ALONG AND BEFORE TOO LONG, WE STARTED GETTING TOGETHER OUTSIDE OF WORK FOR DRINKS, AND WE CALLED THEM OUR FUN NIGHTS. ...LIKE IT. IT WAS SO RIDICULOUS. IT WAS INSANE. CAROLINE WAS CERTAINLY THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO, IN AN OUTING, IF SOMEBODY DID SEEM TO FEEL LEFT OUT, SHE WOULD TALK TO THEM. HEY, CHRIS. LOOK, COME AND SIT HERE. IT WAS REALLY JUST HER NATURE TO REACH IN AND TRY TO PULL SOMEBODY OUT OF THEIR SHELL, AND CHRIS WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS VERY QUIET AND TO HIMSELF. TO CHRIS.All: TO CHRIS. CHRIS, CAROLINE, AND I BECAME CLOSE PRETTY QUICKLY. ♪♪ Jane: THIS IS A PICTURE OF CAROLINE ON HER 21st BIRTHDAY. CAROLINE WAS BORN ON MY 33rd BIRTHDAY, SO WE SHARED MAY 1st. BEST PRESENT I EVER GOT. ♪♪ CAROLINE KNEW A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE, BUT SHE WOULD NOT CHANGE HERSELF TO BECOME PART OF THE CROWD. SHE WAS ALWAYS AN INDIVIDUAL, AND SHE WAS ASSERTIVE. AND SHE WAS VERY TENDER-HEARTED AT THE SAME TIME. SHE HAD GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AND WENT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR A YEAR OR TWO, AND SHE DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR IT, AND SHE SAYS, "I WANT TO START OUT ON MY OWN. I WANT TO GET A JOB." ♪♪ I WASN'T WORRIED THAT CAROLINE WASN'T FULFILLING HER POTENTIAL BY WORKING AT THE GROCERY STORE. I WANTED HER TO HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN HER LIFE AND WORKING FOR A LIVING WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG IS A GOOD EXPERIENCE. WELL, CAROLINE, SHE CAME HOME ONE TIME AND SHE SAID, "DAD, I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT MOVING ME UP WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE." EVENTUALLY, I FOUND OUT SHE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN AND WOULD HOPEFULLY BE STARTING CLASSES THE FALL OF 2016, BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME. SHE HAD TOLD MY WIFE AND HAD TOLD HER OLDER SISTER. THEY WANTED TO KEEP THAT AS A SURPRISE FOR ME. ♪♪ ♪♪ THIS IS YOU? UGH, I LOOK GROSS. NO, IT'S COOL. WHATEVER. [ DOOR OPENS ]OH, MY MOM. I'D LOVED IT WHEN CAROLINE WOULD JUST POP IN AS A SURPRISE, AND SHE WOULD HAVE A DAY OFF DURING THE WEEK SOMETIMES. SHE ALWAYS HAD WORKED EVERY WEEKEND. SO SHE WOULD NEVER CALL FIRST. SHE'D JUST -- SURPRISE AND SHE WAS THERE. - HEY! - HEY! WHEN I FIRST MET CHRIS... ...SHE INTRODUCED US. I SHOOK HIS HAND HELLO. ♪♪ HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING AT HER, NOT ME. ♪♪ AND THEY STAYED JUST A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WERE ON THEIR WAY. ALL DONE. PERHAPS HE WAS A BIT SHY. YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU GET TO KNOW SOMEONE BETTER. HE DIDN'T ENGAGE WITH ME AT ALL. I DON'T EVEN THINK HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE. HE DIDN'T SAY MUCH OTHER THAN HELLO. THAT WAS ABOUT IT. ♪♪ Richard: CAROLINE WAS ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS. I MET HER AROUND 2013, AND WE USED TO WORK TOGETHER, AND WE JUST CLICKED RIGHT AWAY. AND EVEN AFTER WE STOPPED WORKING TOGETHER, CAROLINE AND I WOULD MEET FOR COFFEE. SO, YOU HAVE TO MEET CHRIS... THE FIRST TIME CAROLINE MENTIONED CHRIS, SHE SAID THAT HE WAS PART OF HER NEW WORK CREW, AND SHE WAS REALLY DRAWN TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAD SOME, LIKE, TRAGIC BACKSTORY I WAS LEAD TO BELIEVE. ♪♪ HEY, YOU WANT TO COME PLAY VIDEO GAMES SOME TIME? UH, SURE. THAT SOUNDS FUN. HOW ABOUT TOMORROW? I CAN'T TOMORROW. MY SISTER'S IN TOWN. MOM'S GOT ME DOWN TO COOK. SHE'S NICE, YOUR MOM. MY LIFE'S A MESS. [ CHUCKLES ] ♪♪ CAROLINE WAS REALLY CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE A SUPPORT NETWORK. HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN HOMELESS FOR A TIME SHE HAD MENTIONED. HE HAD RECENTLY GONE THROUGH A BREAKUP AND HAD A SMALL CHILD AT HOME THAT HE DIDN'T SEE. WOW, UH, THAT SOUNDS INTENSE. ♪♪ IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW I'M HERE FOR YOU. ♪♪ I BELIEVE CAROLINE THOUGHT HE NEEDED A FRIEND. SHE THOUGHT THAT, "WELL, IF I CAN BRING SOME FRIENDSHIP TO HIM OR I CAN GIVE HIM AN EAR TO, YOU KNOW, VENT TO, THEN THAT COULD HELP," AND I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HER 100% ON THAT. LOOK, I'VE GOT TO GO, BUT WE'LL DO SOMETHING THIS WEEKEND. COOL. OKAY, UH, SEE YOU. ♪♪ Brooks: CAROLINE AND CHRIS, THEY STARTED HANGING OUT MORE OFTEN OUTSIDE OF WORK. THEY WERE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER, AND THEY WERE ABLE TO TALK FREELY. I BELIEVE THAT CHRIS GOT ALONG WITH CAROLINE AS WELL AS HE DID BECAUSE CAROLINE WAS AN ADMIRABLE WOMAN WHO WAS VERY CARING, SWEET, AND JUST GENUINELY WANTED WHAT WAS ACTUALLY BEST FOR THE PEOPLE IN HER LIFE. IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT MAYBE THERE WAS ANYTHING MORE TO IT THAN THAT. ♪♪ BUT A FEW WEEKS AFTER I STARTED AT THE STORE, WE HAD STARTED TO NOTICE SOMETHING MAYBE A LITTLE OFF ABOUT CHRIS. ♪♪ - HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD? - WHAT? ABOUT CHRIS. ABOUT WHAT HE DID. NO? THAT WAS THE POINT WHEN I HAD REALIZED THAT THINGS WERE NOT QUITE AS THEY SEEMED. ♪♪ ♪♪ I WAS GONNA STOP BY THE MALL TOMORROW AFTER SHIFT. WANT TO COME? ♪♪ TO THE MALL? WITH YOU? ♪♪ WHAT I HAD COME TO FIND OUT WAS THAT CHRIS HAD BEEN HITTING ON MY FRIEND'S LITTLE SISTER, AND SHE WAS ONLY 16. HONESTLY, I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO BELIEVE WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS TRUE. THAT'S SO WEIRD. I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM DOING THAT. ARE YOU SURE? THE STORE WAS ALMOST SORT OF LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL IN REGARDS TO DRAMA AND GOSSIP. THERE WAS REALLY NO STOPPING IT. IT WAS EVERYWHERE, WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR BAD. SEE YOU LATER. WE CERTAINLY GAVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND ASSUMED THAT HE WAS JUST A VERY QUIET PERSON AND MAYBE HIS SOCIAL SKILLS WEREN'T UP TO SNUFF. ♪♪ Richard: CAROLINE HAD GONE OUT TO THE BAR WITH HER BIG GROUP OF FRIENDS. [ LAUGHS ] CHEERS! LATER THAT NIGHT, SHE FELT LIKE SHE HAD HAD TOO MUCH DRINK AND SO SHE ASKED TO BE TAKEN HOME. ♪♪ INSTEAD, SINCE CHRISTOPHER WASN'T SURE WHERE SHE LIVED, HE TOOK HER TO HIS PLACE. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ SHE WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY NOT FEELING RIGHT, NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE AND THINKING THAT MAYBE THAT HE GOTTEN A LITTLE TOO FRIENDLY WITH HER WHILE SHE WAS NOT IN THE RIGHT STATE. ♪♪ BREAKFAST. ♪♪ CAROLINE NEVER HAD ROMANTIC INTEREST IN CHRISTOPHER... ♪♪ ...BUT SHE'D MENTIONED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRINKING, AS WELL, AND HE WAS STARTING TO MAKE HER UNCOMFORTABLE. YOU WERE SO DRUNK. Caroline: YEAH. BEING ONE HER CLOSER FRIENDS, I KNEW THAT HE WASN'T HER TYPE. IT WAS JUST I DON'T THINK HE WAS USED TO PEOPLE TREATING HIM WITH KINDNESS, AND SO I FEEL LIKE HE MISCONSTRUED HER COMPASSION AND HER INTENTION FOR SOMETHING THAT WASN'T THERE. EAT UP. UM... I'M NOT HUNGRY. THANKS. ♪♪ ♪♪ AND AT THE POINT SHE KIND OF REALIZED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FRIENDSHIP THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD. ♪♪ ♪♪ Brooks: AROUND THIS TIME, CHRIS STARTED TO RANDOMLY TEXT HER, ASK HER WHAT WAS UP, ASK HER IF SHE WANTED TO PLAY A COMPUTER GAME, OR ASK HER TO HANG OUT. [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] CAROLINE STARTED TO GET A LITTLE STRESSED OUT WITH THE CONSTANT TEXTING AND MESSAGING, AND IT WAS STARTING TO MAKE HER UNCOMFORTABLE. HE WOULD CONSTANTLY FOLLOW HER AROUND HER WORK, CONTINUE TO TRY TO SIT WITH HER AT LUNCH AND ON BREAKS, CONTINUE TO TRY TO TALK TO HER, AND THINGS LIKE THAT. HE JUST BECAME OBSESSIVE. HONESTLY, I FELT BADLY FOR HIM, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I WAS GETTING NERVOUS AROUND HIM, AND I WAS STARTING TO DOUBT WHETHER I KNEW HIM OR NOT AT ALL. ♪♪ ♪♪ HEY. YOU WANT TO COME PLAY VIDEO GAMES TONIGHT? ♪♪ I- I CAN'T. I HAVE STUFF TO DO. ♪♪ I HAVE A LIFE. ♪♪ CAROLINE ACTUALLY BEGAN TO AVOID HIM MORE AT WORK. SHE WOULD DODGE PAST HIS DEPARTMENT, SORT OF GO TO THE BACK ROOM A DIFFERENT ROUTE. WALK OVER MAYBE TOWARDS ME IN THE SMOOTHIE BAR OR WALK SOMEWHERE ELSE WHEN HE WOULD COME INTO THE PRODUCE DEPARTMENT TO GET THINGS FOR THE MEAT DEPARTMENT, AND HE REALLY DID NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] ♪♪ Caroline's voice: HEY, THIS IS CAROLINE. LEAVE A MESSAGE. CAROLINE STOPPED RESPONDING TO TEXT MESSAGES. SHE STOPPED INVITING HIM TO HAVE LUNCH. SHE STOPPED BEING FRIENDLY WHICH WAS HARD FOR HER BECAUSE SHE WAS A NATURALLY GIVING AND FRIENDLY PERSON. SHE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED RESPONDING TO ANY OF HIS, YOU KNOW, ADVANCEMENTS OR CONVERSATION. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] HEY, THIS IS CAROLINE. LEAVE A MESSAGE. CHRISTOPHER DIDN'T ACCEPT THAT. HE CONTINUED TO TEXT AND TALK... HEY, THIS IS CAROLINE. LEAVE A MESSAGE. ...AND SHE WAS KIND OF OVER IT AT THAT POINT. ♪♪ CAROLINE STARTED TO GET INCREASINGLY IRRITATED WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE SPACE, AND SHE STARTED TO GET MORE VOCAL ABOUT NOT WANTING TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE CLOSE CONTACT WITH CHRISTOPHER. ♪♪ WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME? PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS. I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT CAROLINE, AND I WAS, QUITE FRANKLY, ANXIOUS ABOUT CHRIS, THAT HE WAS BECOMING THREATENING. ♪♪ I JUST HAD A BAD FEELING. ♪♪ ♪♪ I HAVE A LIFE. ♪♪ CHRIS HAD BECOME, OVER THESE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, INCREASINGLY MORE AGGRESSIVE. WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME? ♪♪ LEAVE ME ALONE. ♪♪ I THINK CAROLINE WAS SCARED OF HIM, YEAH. ♪♪ ♪♪ DURING THIS TIME, CAROLINE DID SEEM TO BE MORE DISTANT. TO ME, IT SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS WRESTLING WITH AN ISSUE. YEAH, I COULD SENSE THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON. ♪♪ I TOTALLY AGREED WITH CAROLINE'S DECISION NOT TO BE A FRIEND OF CHRIS'S ANYMORE, AND I TOLD HER THAT SHE NEEDED TO BE POLITE WHEN THEY WERE AT WORK, BUT NOT TO GET INVOLVED AND KEEP HER DISTANCE. ♪♪ I WAS ALWAYS WARY OF A MAN HURTING ONE OF MY GIRLS. ♪♪ I JUST WANTED CAROLINE TO BE SAFE. ♪♪ Brooks: AROUND THIS TIME, CHRIS STARTED HARASSING OTHER MEMBERS OF THE STAFF... ♪♪ ...FROM FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY AND TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE ATTRACTIVE TO REQUESTING... EXPLICIT FAVORS. PERSONALLY FOR CAROLINE AND I AND OUR EXPERIENCE WITH HIM, THIS WAS A NEW LOW. ♪♪ O'Kroley: HAVE FUN. WE WERE UNCOVERING A DARKER, STARTLING SIDE OF HIM THAT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED. I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO MY FRIEND WAS ANYMORE. ♪♪ ESSENTIALLY, I JUST WANTED EVERYTHING TO STOP. I WANTED MY FRIENDS BACK. I WANTED EVERYTHING TO BE NORMAL. ♪♪ ♪♪ THAT YEAR FOR THE CHRISTMAS PARTY, WE WENT TO THE PUB THAT WE USUALLY WENT TO FOR OUR FUN NIGHTS. OKAY, EVERYONE, EVERYONE! GET TOGETHER, OKAY, GUYS? THIS IS A PHOTO FROM THE UGLY SWEATER CHRISTMAS PARTY IN 2015. HERE WE HAVE CAROLINE, SMILING AS USUAL, AND HERE WE'VE GOT CHRIS. ♪♪ I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED HE HAD COME AT ALL, REALLY. ♪♪ HEY. I GOT YOU A BEER. UH, NO THANKS. ♪♪ [ CHUCKLES ] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. CHRIS HAD STARTED SHOWING EXPLICIT PHOTOS OF THIS GIRL TO CAROLINE. WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? ARE YOU JEALOUS? WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU KNOW WHAT, CHRIS? I'M SO SICK OF THIS. SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL WHO WORKED IN THE BAKERY DEPARTMENT PART-TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL. I THINK SHE WAS 16. CAROLINE'S REACTION WAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY DISGUSTED, AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD ME, I WAS MORTIFIED MYSELF. I WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS NICE TO YOU, OKAY? I TRY AND GIVE YOU ADVICE, I TRY AND HELP YOU OUT, AND THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT ME? Richard: CAROLINE HAD OFFICIALLY LOST HER PATIENCE WITH CHRISTOPHER, AND SHE KIND OF PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE AND SHE CALLED HIM A DISGRACE. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP! YOU'RE DISTURBED, CHRIS. YOU NEED HELP. AND SHE GOT VERY BLUNT AND VERY AGGRESSIVE AND UP-FRONT WITH HIM. I WAS VERY PROUD OF HER AT THAT POINT FOR PUTTING HER FOOT DOWN AND STANDING HER GROUND. SO STAY AWAY FROM ME. ♪♪ THAT CHRISTMAS PARTY WAS THE VERY LAST TIME THAT THE THREE OF US WERE TOGETHER OUTSIDE OF WORK. ♪♪ Jane: CAROLINE WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS YOUNG GIRL. SO, SHE SAID TO ME, "I NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS." WHEN SHE SAID THAT TO ME, I FELT LIKE SOMEBODY PUT... ...AN ICICLE, A LARGE ICICLE, LIKE RIGHT THROUGH MY CHEST AND I SAID, "STAY OUT OF IT!" AND SHE LOOKED AT ME, SHE SMILED, AND SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT HOW WE ROLL. NOW, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?" ♪♪ CAROLINE AND I WOULD TALK AND MESSAGE EACH OTHER QUITE OFTEN ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION. ♪♪ SHE SAID, "I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO TALK TO MANAGEMENT WHEN THEY WORK NEXT." I SAID, "I VOTE COPS. NO POINT I GOING TO MANAGEMENT." I ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO GO TO THE POLICE AT THAT POINT IN TIME, AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE POLICE AT THAT MOMENT BECAUSE SHE DID NOT FEEL IN DANGER. SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD HANDLE IT. SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE COULD HANDLE IT. ♪♪ BY THE TIME THE HOLIDAYS WERE OVER, CHRIS WAS ACTING REALLY VERY STRANGELY. HE WAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON THAN THE PERSON I HAD MET WHEN HE HAD STARTED. ♪♪ WE DIDN'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND HIM ANYMORE. ♪♪ ONE DAY IN EARLY JANUARY, I WAS WORKING AN OPENING SHIFT AT THE STORE. THINGS WERE TYPICALLY QUIET THAT TIME OF DAY. ♪♪ OFTEN TIMES, POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS WOULD COME IN TO BUY FOOD FOR THE DAYS COMING, BUT THIS TIME WHEN THE POLICE CAME IN, THEY WEREN'T THERE FOR FOOD. THEY HAD GONE TO THE MEAT DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ THEN, I SAW THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS COMING BACK OUT WITH CHRIS IN HANDCUFFS. ♪♪ ♪♪ DID YOU HEAR WHAT THEY SAID? ♪♪ CHRIS AND THIS GIRL HAD GONE BACK TO HIS PLACE ON CHRISTMAS AND HAD SMOKED AND HAD DRANK. ♪♪ THE GIRL HAD HAD ONE SIP OF A MIXED DRINK, LOST CONSCIOUSNESS, AND WOKE UP WITH HER CLOTHES REMOVED. WE HAD THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD EITHER BE GOING TO JAIL OR HE WOULD BE FIRED AT THAT POINT. I THOUGHT HE WAS GONE FOR GOOD, AND I FELT SAFER. ♪♪ Richard: CAROLINE SEEMED MORE LIKE HER OLD SELF ONCE CHRISTOPHER WAS OUT OF THE STORE. SHE FELT SAFER. SHE FELT BETTER. SHE HAD MORE ENERGY. WE WERE MAKING PLANS AGAIN, AND SHE DIDN'T SEEM AS WEIGHED DOWN LIKE SHE HAD BEEN IN THE PREVIOUS MONTHS. ♪♪ Brooks: WITH CHRIS GONE, WE WERE KIND OF ABLE TO JUST LET GO AGAIN AND FOCUS ON OUR JOBS. ♪♪ EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STORE, EVERYTHING ELSE, JUST GET BACK TO NORMAL LIFE. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ WE HAD THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD EITHER BE GOING TO JAIL OR HE WOULD BE FIRED AT THAT POINT. ♪♪ ♪♪ YOU'RE BACK. I THINK CAROLINE'S EXACT WORDS WERE THAT MANAGEMENT WAS NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING UNTIL THE POLICE CONCLUDED THEIR INVESTIGATION, AND SO THEY HAD NO REAL REASON TO LET HIM GO. SHE'S A LIAR. SHE JUST WANTED SOME ATTENTION. I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD JUST LET HIM COME BACK AND WORK IN THE SAME DEPARTMENTS, ON THE SAME SCHEDULE, ON THE SAME SHIFTS. PUT HIM ON OVERNIGHT, PUT HIM ON WEEKENDS, BUT DON'T PUT HIM BACK IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AND THINK IT'S ALL GONNA BE FINE. ♪♪ I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE. ♪♪ Brooks: THE NERVES JUST STARTED CREEPING BACK UP. ♪♪ CAROLINE MUST HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED. ♪♪ CAROLINE AND I ESTABLISHED A BUDDY SYSTEM. ♪♪ I WOULD WALK HER TO HER CAR AND THEN SHE WOULD DRIVE ME HOME. ♪♪ AT THAT POINT, SO MANY THINGS HAD HAPPENED. ♪♪ I WAS VERY CONCERNED. ♪♪ I HAD NO IDEA WHO CHRIS HAD HIS EYES ON. ♪♪ [ ENGINE STARTS ] I TRIED TO... PUT ON A BRAVE FACE FOR CAROLINE, WHO WAS PUTTING ON A BRAVE FACE FOR ME. ♪♪ [ TELEVISION PLAYS INDISTINCTLY IN BACKGROUND ] Jim: IT'S VERY HARD WHEN YOU SEE ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING. ♪♪ AND, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD -- WITH CAROLINE, WE WOULD OFTEN ASK AND SHE'D SAY, "WELL, IT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL. I'M DEALING WITH IT." [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] CHRISTOPHER O'KROLEY BECAME MORE AND MORE DISTURBING. ♪♪ ♪♪ I HAVE THE TEXTS THAT CAROLINE WAS SENT BY CHRISTOPHER O'KROLEY, AS WELL AS HER RESPONSES. [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] AT 10:19, SHE RECEIVED A TEXT SAYING, "I WONDER WHAT TIME YOU WORK TOMORROW?" ♪♪ [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] ♪♪ [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] LATER, CAROLINE RECEIVED A TEXT STATING, "WHY ARE YOU SUCH A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING?" [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] ♪♪ CAROLINE'S RESPONSE WAS A TEXT SAYING, "CHRIS, ARE YOU DRUNK? WHY THE HELL ARE YOU TEXTING ME?" ♪♪ RIGHT AFTER THAT... [ CELLPHONE CHIMES ] ...IT WAS A TEXT MESSAGE FROM CHRIS SAYING, "WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET MORE **** SHOVED DOWN YOUR THROAT." ♪♪ CAROLINE'S FINAL RESPONSE TO CHRIS WAS, "CHRIS, PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE." ♪♪ WE TOLD HER THAT WE FELT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO GO TO THE STORE MANAGEMENT. SHE AGREED WITH US, AND AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE NEXT DAY, WENT TO STORE MANAGEMENT WITH THIS EVIDENCE. I WANTED THE SITUATION TO BE DONE. I WANTED IT TO BE HANDLED AND BE DONE. AND HE WOULD NOT BE NEAR HER ANYMORE. ♪♪ ♪♪ Brooks: THE NEXT DAY, SHE HAD LET ME KNOW THAT SHE WAS GONNA GO SIT IN A MEETING WITH THE MANAGERS. ♪♪ Jim: SINCE CAROLINE HAD SAVED THE TEXT MESSAGES THAT THEY COULD NOT IN ANY WAY DENY WHAT WAS HAPPENING, IT FORCED THEM TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME TYPE OF DECISION. ♪♪ THEY INVESTIGATED FURTHER AND SUSPENDED CHRIS DURING THE INVESTIGATION. ♪♪ Jane: CAROLINE THOUGHT SHE WAS IN CONTROL AND COULD HANDLE IT. SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS SAFE. ♪♪ Caroline: HEY. WHAT? THEY FIRED HIM. WHAT? [ SIGHS ] THEY JUST TOLD ME. THEY FIRED HIM. REALLY? ♪♪ SHE SEEMED VERY CONFIDENT AND VERY ACCOMPLISHED, AND SHE TOLD ME, WITH ALMOST A JOYOUS RINGING IN HER VOICE, THAT HE WASN'T COMING BACK TO THE STORE. ♪♪ DOES HE KNOW YOU COMPLAINED? I DON'T KNOW. DOES IT MATTER? THINK ABOUT IT. ♪♪ WE BOTH KNEW THAT CHRIS WOULD BE BLAMING CAROLINE FOR THIS, AND QUITE HONESTLY, I WAS TERRIFIED. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Brooks: CAROLINE WORKED THE NOON TO 8:00 SHIFT THAT DAY. SHE SEEMED, QUITE DISTRACTED AND PREOCCUPIED. ♪♪ I WAS CERTAINLY WORRIED ABOUT CAROLINE BECAUSE I WANTED HER TO BE OKAY. I WAS ONLY SCHEDULED UNTIL 2:00 P.M. THAT DAY, AND SO WHEN MY SHIFT WAS OVER, I LEFT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO STAY UNTIL CLOSE AND WALK HER OUT, AS WELL. WE HAD PLANS TO MEET UP LATER THAT EVENING. ♪♪ I DIDN'T STILL FULLY REALIZE, WHAT DANGER CHRIS WAS CAPABLE OF, BUT I KNEW THAT SOMETHING COULD POTENTIALLY GO WRONG. ♪♪ CHRIS!
