 SHE WAS ECSTATIC. MELINDA WAS REALLY HAPPY. SO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY? IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY EASIER. STEPHANIE DIDN'T DO ONE SINGLE THING THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. YOU JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HOW FRUSTRATING THIS ALL IS. WHEN I FIRST MET MELINDA, SHE WAS ASSISTANT TO A PROPERTY MANAGER. SHE WAS REALLY GOOD AT HER JOB, SO THEY PROMOTED HER TO THE MANAGER. THEY GAVE MELINDA THIS POSITION IN HOPES OF TURNING THIS COMMUNITY AROUND, OR STABILIZING IT. I WASN'T SURPRISED WHEN MELINDA GOT PROMOTED. I KNEW SHE WOULD, 'CAUSE MELINDA WAS THAT KIND OF GIRL. SHE LIKED TO TALK TO PEOPLE, AND SHE MADE THE PEOPLE FEEL SPECIAL. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] HEY, DAD. WE WERE ALWAYS IN CONTACT. WE WERE STILL CLOSE-KNIT, EVEN THOUGH WE WERE 3,000 MILES AWAY. THERE WAS A COUPLE TIMES MELINDA TOLD ME STRAIGHT UP, SHE SAID "DAD, I WANT TO QUIT." BUT I TOLD HER "LOOK, MELINDA, YOU DON'T EVER LET NOBODY -- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T EVER RUN AWAY FROM SOMETHING. YOU FIX IT." AND I WAS TELLING HER TO DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. PUSH -- ALL THOSE PROBLEMS -- DOCUMENT THEM AND PUSH THEM UPSTAIRS. MELINDA HAD TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY FACET OF THAT WHOLE PROPERTY -- MARKETING, KEEPING TRACK OF THE MAINTENANCE GUY OR GUYS, DEALING WITH EVERYBODY'S -- I MEAN, WITH A PROPERTY THAT SIZE, EVERYBODY'S PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS. SHE HAD A LOT ON HER PLATE. OKAY, MS. LOWREY, YOUR A/C SHOULD BE WORKING NOW. JUST REMEMBER, THE RED LINE IS THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE. SHE WENT OUT OF HER WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WERE TAKEN CARE OF. IF THEY HAD ISSUES, THEY WERE ADDRESSED AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. IF THERE WAS ANY SAFETY CONCERNS, THEY WERE TAKEN CARE OF AND ADDRESSED. RASHAAN WILL STOP BY LATER TO INSTALL THE HAND RAIL ON YOUR SHOWER. THERE WASN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAD ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT MELINDA. PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY LIKED OR LOVED HER. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ DOOR OPENS ] WHERE WERE YOU? I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL MORNING. YEAH, YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO, WHAT'S TO DEAL WITH TODAY? Mike: RASHAAN WAS THE MAINTENANCE MAN THAT SHE HAD. ANYTHING THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE WITH THE COMPLEX, HE WOULD GO DO. THERE'S A NEW MOVE-IN -- UNIT 28. I NEED YOU TO SET UP A HAND RAIL FOR MS LOWREY. AND THEN, WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT, I NEED YOU TO HAND OUT THESE FLIERS. Schaefer: RASHAAN LIVED IN THE COMMUNITY WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN, WITH A EXTREMELY DISCOUNTED RENTAL RATE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD BRING YOUR KIDS. SOMEONE MIGHT BE SELLING A TOY THEY LIKE. YEAH, MAYBE. Mike: MELINDA WANTED, FIRST, TO CREATE MORE OF A SENSE OF COMMUNITY THERE. INSTEAD OF HAVING SO MANY HOUSES ALL SEPARATE, BUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY BY HAVING HER OWN WEBSITE FOR THE COMMUNITY THERE, AND THEN, HAVING THINGS LIKE GARAGE SALES FOR THE COMMUNITY. SHE WAS SLOWLY TURNING IT AROUND TO A COMMUNITY, FRIENDLY PLACE. THERE'S A LOT TO DO TODAY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE BACK LATER. Schaefer: WHEN SHE TOOK A JOB, SHE KIND OF DEEMED IT AS, LIKE, I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT HER "BABY." SO, SHE WANTED TO DO A GOOD JOB AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. SO, ANYTHING THAT OCCURRED THERE, IT WAS LIKE HER HOME. ♪♪ SHE WANTED TO DO GOOD IN HER JOB, BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO IT AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE PEOPLE TO HELP HER DO IT, AND SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS, BASICALLY, DOING EVERYTHING ON HER OWN. WHAT'S THIS? WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNEW YOU OWED THIS, RIGHT? Mike: ONE TIME MELINDA SAID THAT A BIG GUY CAME IN AND LEANED ON HER DESK AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HE WAS LATE WITH THE RENT AND STUFF LIKE THAT. $800? Schaefer: SHE SAID SHE FELT INTIMIDATED JUST BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED THERE, THEY, JUST, WERE EITHER BIGGER MEN, OR JUST, ANYBODY COULD BE INTIMIDATED BY HAVING TO EVICT SOMEBODY. ♪♪ ♪♪ MORNING, MYRA. MYRA IS THE CLEANING LADY FROM THE PROPERTIES. WHENEVER THERE WOULD BE A VACANT, OR A MOVE OUT, OR AN EVICTION, MYRA TYPICALLY WAS THE LADY THAT WOULD COME IN AND WOULD CLEAN THE RESIDENCE FOR THE FLIP OR THE TURN. MYRA, DID YOU SEE STEPHANIE THIS WEEKEND? OKAY. THANKS. STEPHANIE WAS HIRED BECAUSE SOMEBODY CANNOT WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. SO, SHE WOULD FILL IN FOR MELINDA ON THE WEEKENDS, IF THEY WANTED TO KEEP THE OFFICE OPEN TO BRING IN TRAFFIC. OR IF MELINDA HAD TO TAKE OFF FOR A CERTAIN DAY, SHE WOULD FILL IN FOR HER. [ PHONE BEEPS ] Cathy: HEY, IT'S CATHY. I'VE CALLED FIVE TIMES, AND CAN'T GET THROUGH. MY TOILET IS STILL BROKEN. I NEED SOMEONE TO CALL ME BACK RIGHT AWAY. Schaefer: WHEN STEPHANIE WAS WORKING, THERE SEEMED TO ALWAYS BE COMPLAINTS. THE OFFICE NOT BEING OPEN NORMAL WORKING HOURS OR PHONES NOT BEING ANSWERED AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. [ PHONE BEEPS ] Matt: HEY, THIS IS MATT IN UNIT 11. I'M CALLING BECAUSE MY GARAGE DOOR IS STILL BROKEN. I WAITED ALL WEEKEND FOR IT TO BE FIXED. I CAN'T GET IN, I CAN'T GET OUT, AND I CAN'T PARK. SO, WHEN STEPHANIE WAS FILLING IN FOR MELINDA, IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] HEY, DAVID. DAVID WAS MELINDA'S DISTRICT MANAGER. SO, THAT WAS HER DIRECT REPORT. DAVID WAS THE KIND OF BOSS THAT WOULD BE LOOKING FOR FAULTS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HELP. I'M SORRY. I JUST RAN TO MY CAR. I KNOW. IT'S BEEN CRAZY. I'M SORRY. STEPHANIE DIDN'T... WHEN MELINDA WOULD VOICE HER PROBLEMS WITH STEPHANIE, IT KIND OF WAS PUT TO THE BACK BURNER. GOT IT. SORRY, DAVID. IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. OKAY. [ MELINDA DIALING ] HI, DAD. STEPHANIE'S GONE. Mike: STEPHANIE HAD BEEN LET GO BECAUSE OF ALL THE ABSENTEEISM OR TARDINESS AND JUST NOT FOCUSING ON HER JOB BY BEING SOMEWHERE ELSE WHEN SHE SHOULD BE IN THEIR OFFICE, THERE. I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. I USED TO TELL HER, "HEY, LOOK, THE PEOPLE THAT GET TERMINATED HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR THEMSELVES AND SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING THAT CAUSED THEM TO LOSE THEIR JOB." ANYWAY, I'VE GO TO GO. I'VE GOT TO CALL MIKE AND TELL HIM THAT I'M GONNA BE LATE. OKAY. I LOVE YOU. BYE. THAT MORNING I WOKE HER UP, TOLD HER I LOVED HER, AND KISSED HER GOODBYE, AND WENT TO WORK. IT WAS NOTHING OUT OF THE NORMAL. AND WE WERE PLANNING ON GOING ON A VACATION, I GUESS TO CELEBRATE, AS OUR HONEYMOON. BUT WE NEVER GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. [ PHONE RINGING ] [ PHONE DIALING ] [ PHONE RINGING ] POLICE SAY A CUSTODIAN FOUND THE WOMAN'S BODY THIS MORNING IN THE LEASING OFFICE AND CALLED 911. WHILE DETECTIVES HAVE YET TO RELEASE HER NAME, MANY WHO LIVE THERE KNEW HER FACE. A FRIEND CALLED ME AT WORK AND SHE SAID THAT THE CLEANING LADY CALLED HER AND SAID THAT SHE FOUND MELINDA, AND SHE WAS COVERED IN BLOOD. I WAS IN SHOCK, AND I STARTED CALLING MELINDA OVER AND OVER AND OVER. [ PHONE RINGING ] MY MAIN GOAL WAS TO GET OFF THE PHONE, GET IN MY CAR, AND GET TO HER AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. THAT WAS IT. [ SIRENS WAILING] Reporter: YELLOW TAPE CRISS-CROSSES THROUGH THE TREES SURROUNDING THE LEASING OFFICE. DETECTIVES IN PROTECTIVE BOOTIES WALK IN AND OUT OF THE OFFICE PROCESSING A CRIME SCENE WHERE THEY SAY A WOMAN WAS MURDERED. HOW, THEY WON'T SAY. BY WHOM STILL REMAINS A QUESTION TOO. [ SIRENS WAILING ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] AFTER THE 911 CALL WAS PLACED, THERE WAS A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE AT THE PROPERTY. WITHIN MINUTES, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT GOING FROM FIRST RESPONDERS BEING ON SCENE TO THERE BEING A TEAM OF DETECTIVES. TOM, TAKE A LOOK AROUND. MELINDA SCHAEFER, 29, EMPLOYED AS THE COMPLEX PROPERTY MANAGER. THE OFFICERS DESCRIBED THE SCENE AS PRETTY GORY. THERE WAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE IN THE RENTAL OFFICE. I'M LOOKING AT ONE OF THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS. THE PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS BLOOD ON THE BLINDS, ON THE WINDOW SILL. I SEE THE TRASH CAN KNOCKED OVER. I SEE THE OFFICE CHAIR THAT WOULD HAVE BELONGED TO MELINDA ON THE FLOOR ON IT'S SIDE. IT JUST MAKES ME THINK OF WHAT MELINDA'S LAST MOMENTS WERE LIKE -- HER FIGHTING TO THE DEATH. I JUST, I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR HER THAT MORNING. I CANNOT IMAGINE. ONE THING THAT WAS NOTICEABLE ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE WAS THAT THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF CLEAN-UP -- AND BY CLEAN-UP I MEAN, THERE WERE NOTICEABLE WIPE MARKS ON THE FLOOR. WE TRIED TO GET DNA FROM DIFFERENT ITEMS IN THE OFFICE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE DNA WAS REALLY INCONCLUSIVE FOR US IN THIS CASE. WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE DIRECT EVIDENCE IN THE DNA OR OTHER FORENSIC EVIDENCE, YOU HAVE TO START LOOKING INTO OTHER THINGS -- MOTIVE AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE MURDER. ♪♪ ♪♪ I PULLED UP TO THE COMMUNITY... MELINDA! ...AND THE WHOLE CORNER WHERE MELINDA'S ENTRANCE TO HER OFFICE WAS, WAS YELLOW TAPED. THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE STANDING AROUND, THERE WAS -- NEWS PEOPLE WERE THERE ALREADY. AND YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO RUN IN THE BUILDING, BUT I KNOW THAT I COULDN'T. ♪♪ SO, THEN, THEY CAME BACK OUT AND TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD PASSED AWAY. I GUESS I WAS IN A HUGE STATE OF SHOCK... ...KIND OF LIKE A NUMB SHOCK. I GUESS THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. LIKE THE BIGGEST, STRONGEST PERSON YOU KNOW PUNCHING YOU IN THE STOMACH. WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR WIFE? THIS MORNING. I GUESS, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IN A LOT OF CASES, THAT'S -- THE HUSBAND IS THE FIRST SUSPECT THAT THEY LOOK INTO. THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE OFFICE, WHAT TIME I HAD CONTACT WITH HER. I SHOWED THEM THE TEXT MESSAGES. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I SPOKE WITH HER. AROUND 9:15, 9:20, SHE SENT ME A TEXT MESSAGE BECAUSE I WAS GRUMPY THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND JUST KIND OF PLAYING BACK AND FORTH WITH THAT. MELINDA TEXTED ME "HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY." AND I SAID "YOU, TOO." SHE SENT BACK AND EMOJI WITH HER TONGUE STICKING OUT. AND THAT WAS THE LAST MESSAGE THAT I RECEIVED FROM HER. OKAY. HANG IN THERE. TOM. ♪♪ WHEN DAVID ARRIVED TO THE PROPERTY FOR HIS MEETING, HE STUMBLED UPON THE VERY HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE. I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE WAS A BIT OF SHOCK OR DISBELIEF ON DAVID'S PART, AND ARRIVING AND JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. WE NEED TO ACCESS YOURS AND MELINDA'S FILES. ALSO, WE NEED MELINDA'S WORK PHONE. YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT FOR ME? A LOT OF WHAT DAVID DID THAT ASSISTED WITH THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE LEASING OFFICE. THAT BECAME IMPORTANT FOR THE INVESTIGATION. ♪♪ EARLY ON, THERE WERE NO SUSPECTS IN THIS CASE. AND SO, POLICE ESSENTIALLY LOOKED AT EVERYONE. THE OFFICERS WHO ARE ON SCENE CONDUCT WHAT WE CALL A "NEIGHBORHOOD CANVAS," SO, ESSENTIALLY, KNOCKING ON RESIDENTS' DOORS TO INQUIRE IF ANYONE HEARD ANYTHING OR SAW ANYTHING THAT MORNING. AS POLICE ARE INTERVIEWING DIFFERENT WITNESSES, PEOPLE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING OF THINGS, AND THIS IS WHY IT BECOMES IMPORTANT FOR THE POLICE TO TRY TO CONFIRM THE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE GIVEN. BUT NOTHING CAME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD CANVAS. ♪♪ POLICE WANTED TO TALK TO EMPLOYEES THAT WORK WITH HER IN THAT OFFICE. MYRA AND RASHAAN WERE NOT SUSPECTS TO THE CASE, THEY WERE JUST IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT THE DETECTIVES WANTED TO SPEAK TO BECAUSE THEY HAD LAST HAD CONTACT WITH MELINDA. YOU LIVE ON THE PROPERTY? YEAH, IN A UNIT OVER THERE, WITH MY WIFE AND KIDS. AND YOU BOTH SAW MELINDA THIS MORNING? COME THIS WAY, PLEASE. ON A CASE LIKE THIS, IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH A TIMELINE OF EVENTS. MYRA SAID SHE WENT TO HAVE COFFEE THAT MORNING. POLICE WENT TO THE COFFEE STORE, PULLED UP VIDEO SURVEILLANCE, AND WERE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT SHE WAS THERE AND MADE A PURCHASE. Detective: DID YOU HAVE ANY INTERACTION WITH MELINDA THAT MORNING? YEAH, I CHECKED IN WITH HER. THEN, SHE SAID SHE NEEDED SOME BATTERIES SO I WENT TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE AND CAME BACK. OKAY. AROUND WHAT TIME WAS THAT? AROUND 9:20.9:20 IN RASHAAN'S INTERVIEW, THERE WAS NOTHING IN PARTICULAR THAT JUMPED OUT TO ME ABOUT HIS DEMEANOR. AND DID YOU STICK AROUND? Rashaan: NO. NO. WE NEEDED SOME SUPPLIES SO I LEFT FOR THE HARDWARE STORE, I THINK IT WAS AROUND 9:30. 9:30 HE CAME ACROSS AS VERY CALM, COOL, COLLECTED. SO, IN THAT SENSE, HIS DEMEANOR ITSELF WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT RAISED ANY LEVEL OF SUSPICION FOR ME. IS THERE ANY REASON WHY ANYONE AT WORK, OR ON THE COMPLEX WOULD WANT TO HURT MELINDA? NAH. NAH. SHE WAS A PEACEFUL LADY. YEAH, PEACEFUL LADY. POLICE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM THE FIRST STORE THAT RASHAAN FREQUENTED ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER TO PURCHASE BATTERIES. AFTER REVIEWING THAT VIDEO, IT DID CORROBORATE RASHAAN'S STORY THAT HE DID, IN FACT, MAKE THE TRIP TO THE STORE THAT MORNING. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ THE DETECTIVES CAST A WIDE NET, AND THEY LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF PEOPLE. AND FROM THERE, TRY TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE ABOUT MELINDA TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THIS TO HER. THANKS. ♪♪ ♪♪ THE AUTOPSY FOR MELINDA REVEALED THAT SHE SUFFERED FROM 69 STAB WOUNDS. WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL DID THIS? Richardson: CERTAINLY, WITH 69 STAB WOUNDS, IT DEFINITELY LOOKED LIKE THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PERSONAL. Mike: WHEN I CAME TO BALTIMORE THAT NIGHT, THE DETECTIVES CAME TO THE HOUSE AND ASKED US IF WE KNEW ANYBODY THAT WOULD WANT TO HURT MELINDA AND I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW. I REALLY COULDN'T THINK OF ANYONE THAT WOULD WANT TO HURT MELINDA. THEY BROUGHT HER PURSE. IN HER PURSE, THERE WAS A CHECK THAT WAS SIGNED BY HER THAT WASN'T TAKEN. AFTER THAT, AND A FEW DAYS LATER, THEY RULED OUT THAT THERE WAS ANY SUSPICION OF ROBBERY, 'CAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING TAKEN AT ALL OF ANY VALUE FROM THE OFFICE OR FROM HER PERSONAL SELF. EVERYTHING WAS STILL THERE -- ALL THE JEWELRY, ALL THE MONEY, THE CHECK, EVERYTHING. THE POLICE ASKED FOR HER COMPUTER. THEY COULD COME AND TAKE ANYTHING THEY WANTED OUT OF THE HOUSE. WHATEVER THEY NEEDED TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT, THEY COULD TAKE. ONLY THING ON ANYONE'S MIND WAS, YOU KNOW, I'LL ANSWER WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BECAUSE I HOPE YOU FIND HIM BEFORE I FIND HIM. SO... ...SCHAEFER GETS A TEXT FROM HIS WIFE AT 9:24 A.M. THERE'S A MISSED CALL TO MELINDA'S OFFICE AT 9:51 A.M. THAT'S A HALF-HOUR WINDOW IN WHICH THE MURDER COULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE. AND A RESIDENT CALLS 911 AT 11:00 A.M. WHAT ELSE WE MISSING? WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT STEPHANIE. Mike: STEPHANIE WAS THE WEEKEND HELP THAT WOULD COME ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAYS TO DO THE WORK THAT MELINDA WAS DOING DURING THE WEEKDAYS. CERTAINLY, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEONE BEING TERMINATED TWO DAYS BEFORE, IT DOES BRING TO MIND QUESTIONS OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH, AND COULD SHE HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS? STEPHANIE WAS AWARE THAT MELINDA HAD BEEN MURDERED. SHE EXPLAINED TO POLICE THAT SHE HAD ACTUALLY SAW IT ON THE NEWS. SHE ADVISED THAT SHE WAS NOT IN BALTIMORE COUNTY AT THE TIME. POLICE, OBVIOUSLY, JUST LOOKED AND MADE SURE THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INJURIES ABOUT HER THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL STEPHANIE'S PHONE RECORDS, WHICH CONFIRMED THAT SHE WAS IN ANOTHER COUNTY AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER. AND AT THAT POINT, STEPHANIE WAS RULED OUT AS A SUSPECT. Schaefer: MELINDA EXPRESSED, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THAT SHE FELT UNSAFE IN HER OFFICE. MELINDA WAS IN A CORNER ROOM WITH NO SECURITY. THERE WAS NO PANIC BUTTON. THERE WAS NO ALARM TO PULL. SHE WAS PRETTY MUCH IN THAT OFFICE BY HERSELF. HI, DAD. SHE ASKED ME, "DAD, CAN YOU COME OUT HERE AND PUT SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN MY OFFICE?" AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "WHY?" IT DIDN'T DAWN ON ME. I SAID, "WHY?" I JUST...I'D FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT. AND I SAID, "MELINDA I'M NOT GONNA FLY 3,000 MILES TO COME OUT THERE AND PUT CAMERAS UP FOR YOU. AND I SAID, "BETTER YET, TELL DAVID TO DO IT. HE'S THE BOSS. AND TELL HIM TO PUT SOMETHING IN THERE FOR YOU." [ UNEXPLAINED CLANGING ] HOLD ON. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] HI, DAD, SORRY. I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING. ANYWAY, I'VE GOT TO GO. I'VE GOT TO CALL MIKE AND TELL HIM I'M GONNA BE LATE. OKAY. I LOVE YOU. OKAY. Richardson: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DETECTIVES REQUESTED WAS ACCESS TO MELINDA'S PERSONAL COMPUTER AT HOME. THOSE ITEMS WERE SUBMITTED FOR FORENSIC EXTRACTION, AND WHAT IT ULTIMATELY REVEALED WAS THAT, THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MURDER, MELINDA ACCESSED A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS. YOU'VE BEEN LATE EVERY DAY THIS WEEK. AND ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, IN PARTICULAR, WAS A PERSONNEL ACTION FORM. SOMEONE ELSE AT THE OFFICE WAS GETTING FIRED. Detective: HEY, BOSS, I'VE GOT SOMETHING. ♪♪ ♪♪ RASHAAN WILLIAMS. Richardson: DETECTIVES FOUND A TEXT MESSAGE FROM RASHAAN, WHO WAS THE MAINTENANCE MAN FOR THE PROPERTY, WHERE HE WAS ASKING MELINDA, WAS HE GETTING FIRED. IT HAD TO DO WITH HIM NOT COMPLETING SOMETHING ON THE PROPERTY IN A TIMELY FASHION. AND MELINDA WAS EXPLAINING TO HIM THAT THEY HAD CALLED SOMEONE ELSE, THAT THE SITUATION WOULD BE RESOLVED. AND RASHAAN'S COMMENT WAS, "AM I GETTING FIRED OVER THIS?" Mike: MELINDA WAS TELLING ME THAT SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE MAINTENANCE WORKER. SHE WAS SAYING THAT THINGS WEREN'T GETTING DONE, THAT SOMETIMES SHE COULDN'T FIND HIM. YOU'VE BEEN LATE EVERY DAY THIS WEEK. AND I'M MISSING RECEIPTS AND PETTY CASH. HAVE YOU TOLD DAVID ABOUT THIS? RASHAAN WAS FORMALLY PLACED ON PROBATION ON APRIL 26, 2013. HE WAS PLACED ON PROBATION BY DAVID. YEAH. I HAD TO. ♪♪ ♪♪ HE WANTS YOU TO SIGN THESE. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ DOOR SLAMS ] LOOK, I KNOW I'M LATE, BUT... IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG DEAL FOR RASHAAN IF HE HAD BEEN TERMINATED. NOT ONLY DID RASHAAN STAND TO LOSE HIS JOB, HE ALSO STOOD TO LOSE HIS HOME. I GOT LIKE MORE OUTSIDE THE JOB. I GOT 10 UNITS. Schaefer: DAVID HAD BASICALLY TOLD RASHAAN THAT HE IS ON HIS LAST STRIKE, OR HIS LAST LEG WITH THE COMPANY, AND THAT HE WILL BE LET GO AT HIS NEXT INFRACTION THAT OCCURS, NO MATTER HOW MINOR OR MAJOR. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ OKAY. WHAT TIME WAS THAT? AROUND 9:20.9:20? RASHAAN EXPLAINED THAT HE MADE TWO DIFFERENT TRIPS THAT MORNING. HE WENT TO ONE STORE TO PURCHASE BATTERIES AND ANOTHER STORE TO PURCHASE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. RASHAAN INITIALLY ADVISED THAT HE LEFT THE PROPERTY ABOUT 9:30 OR SO TO MAKE A TRIP TO THE HARDWARE STORE. BUT WHEN POLICE PULLED THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, IT ACTUALLY SHOWED THAT RASHAAN ARRIVED TO THE HARDWARE STORE ABOUT 10:39 A.M. SO, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL OVER AN HOUR OF MISSING TIME. LOOK AT HIS TWO CLOTHES. IN THE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FROM THE STORE THAT RASHAAN VISITED ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER TO PURCHASE BATTERIES, HE WAS OBSERVED WEARING A ZIP-UP JACKET, AS WELL AS KHAKI-COLORED CARGO PANTS. IN THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM THE HARDWARE STORE THAT RASHAAN VISITED, RASHAAN WAS NOTED TO WEAR A SHORT SLEEVE POLO-STYLE SHIRT AND STRAIGHT-LEG, KHAKI PANTS. ♪♪ HE CHANGED HIS CLOTHES. LET'S GO GET HIM. ♪♪ THERE WAS DEFINITELY A RED FLAG WHEN POLICE SAW THAT THERE WAS THIS NOTICEABLE CHANGE OF CLOTHING. POLICE QUESTIONED RASHAAN ABOUT THE CLOTHING, AND IN PARTICULAR, THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF HE HAD IN HIS POSSESSION THE JACKET THAT HE WAS SEEN WEARING EARLIER THAT MORNING. HE WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE THE JACKET, AND IN FACT, HE NEVER PRODUCED THE JACKET. CAN YOU TURN OVER YOUR WORK PHONE? OH, UM... I LOST IT. AT THIS POINT, THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE LEADING YOU BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF RASHAAN, AND THINGS THAT JUST COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED -- THE MISSING JACKET, AND NOW, THIS MISSING CELL PHONE. POLICE OBTAINED CELLPHONE RECORDS FOR THE MAINTENANCE CELLPHONE THAT WENT MISSING ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER. RASHAAN SAYS HE LOST HIS PHONE AROUND 9:20, BUT LOOK AT THIS. HIS PHONE WAS ACTIVE OVER AN HOUR LATER, CLOSE TO THE HARDWARE STORE. THERE WERE TWO SIGNIFICANT EVENTS TO SEE FROM THE CELLPHONE RECORDS -- AT 10:28, THERE WAS A MISSED CALL, AND AT 10:31, THERE WAS SOME SORT OF DATA COMMUNICATION, MAYBE ALONG THE LINES OF YOUR CELLPHONE UPDATING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT MEANS HIS PHONE WAS STILL IN HIS POSSESSION AT 10:40. THOSE TWO EVENTS KIND OF SHOW THAT THE PHONE WAS HOVERING IN THE AREA OFF OF LIBERTY ROAD. THIS AREA WHERE THE PHONE WAS CLOSE TO, THERE WERE A LOT OF APARTMENT COMPLEXES. AND SO, THE ACCESS TO DUMPSTERS AND SO FORTH CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO RASHAAN. RASHAAN WILLAIMS. [ SIGHS ] HE HAD MOTIVE. HE HAD OPPORTUNITY. BUT CAN WE CONVICT? THIS WAS NOT A DIRECT-EVIDENCE CASE. THERE WAS NOT AN EYEWITNESS, NO FORENSIC EVIDENCE TYING RASHAAN TO THE CRIME SCENE. RASHAAN MAY GET AWAY WITH MURDER. ♪♪ Reporter: POLICE NOW SAY THE LAST PERSON TO SEE HER ALIVE WAS THIS MAN -- 27-YEAR-OLD RASHAAN WILLIAMS. INVESTIGATORS TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY TUESDAY NIGHT. I FELT HELPLESS. I FELT LIKE, "WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE? WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT?" IT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW, WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE? YOU'RE THE DAD. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOUR KID. Richardson: IT WAS A FIVE-DAY TRIAL. THE STATE CALLED OVER 30 WITNESSES. THE DEFENSE CALLED THREE WITNESSES IN THEIR CASE. AND I JUST THINK IT WAS A TENSE COURTROOM. IN PARTICULAR, I REMEMBER JUDGE GIVING EVERYONE THAT WAS SITTING IN THE GALLERY AN INSTRUCTION ABOUT NOT HAVING ANY OUTBURSTS. THAT'S HOW TENSE IT WAS. I WAS AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHEN THE TRIAL WAS HERE, I WAS HERE. IT WAS A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. THERE WAS NO MURDER WEAPON. THERE WAS NO VIDEOTAPE OF HIM DOING THE CRIME. SO, IF I HAD TO TAKE A GUESS AT WHAT TRANSPIRED THAT MORNING BETWEEN RASHAAN AND MELINDA, I DO THINK THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME SORT OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. MORNING. IT SHOULD BE A BUSY DAY. YOUR TICKET AND KEYS ARE IN THE LOCK BOX. ♪♪ ♪♪ WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO GO AND BUY ME SOME BATTERIES FIRST? Schaefer: I THINK SHE ALMOST FELT THAT THERE WAS NO CHOICE. SHE'D KIND OF GIVEN HIM CHANCE AFTER CHANCE TO DO HIS JOB, AND YOU KNOW, HE DID HAVE TWO CHILDREN. HE DID HAVE A WIFE. SO, I THINK IT PROBABLY WEIGHED ON HER. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Richardson: THERE WAS A LEDGER ON MELINDA'S DESK, AND IN THAT LEDGER WERE ALL OF THE E-MAILS DOCUMENTING RASHAAN'S POOR WORK PERFORMANCE. ALL OF THOSE E-MAILS AND THINGS WERE CONTAINED IN THAT LEDGER. I CERTAINLY COULD SEE HOW, IN THAT MOMENT RASHAAN, COULD HAVE SNAPPED. I DO THINK RASHAAN WAS STEWING OVER THIS. HE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN HOT WATER AT WORK. HE HAD JUST COMPLETED A PROBATION FAIRLY RECENTLY. AND IN ADDITION, WHEN STEPHANIE WAS TERMINATED TWO DAYS BEFORE, I THINK HE KNEW THE WRITING WAS ON THE WALL FOR HIM. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ RASHAAN BREATHING HEAVILY ] AFTER RASHAAN MURDERED MELINDA, HE TOOK SOME TIME TO WIPE UP. I ALSO WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE REMOVED THE JACKET THAT HE WAS WEARING. IT WAS PROBABLY PRETTY BLOODY. ♪♪ ♪♪ RASHAAN FELT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR ENOUGH FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS EXIT, AND HE DID. [ BELT BUCKLES CLICKING ] [ CLOTHES RUSTLING ] ♪♪ ♪♪ I REALLY BELIEVE THAT RASHAAN ONLY CAME TO THE HARDWARE STORE IN AN ATTEMPT TO HAVE AN ALIBI IN THIS CASE. I DON'T BELIEVE HE WAS THERE TO PURCHASE ANY TYPE OF MATERIALS FOR THE PROPERTY. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] RASHAAN CERTAINLY HAD MOTIVE IN THIS CASE, HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS, AND IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT RASHAAN WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID THIS. ♪♪ WHEN YOU GET WORD THAT THERE'S A VERDICT, I ALWAYS -- SOME GET THAT SINKING FEELING. SOMETIMES, YOU GET BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR STOMACH. AND JUST FOR A CASE LIKE THIS, WHERE YOU KNEW RASHAAN DID IT, YOU WANT TO BRING THIS CONVICTION HOME FOR THIS FAMILY. YOU WANT TO, HOPEFULLY, BRING SOME SORT OF CLOSURE TO THEM FOR THIS HORRIFIC EVENT. AND I FELT THE WEIGHT OF THAT IN THAT MOMENT THAT YOU'RE WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THE VERDICT. THEY ASKED THE JURY, "ON THE VERDICT OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, HOW DO YOU FIND?" AND THEY SAID, "NOT GUILTY." ♪♪ SO, I PUT MY HEAD DOWN. AND THEN, THEY SAID, "BUT ON THIS CHARGE OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER, HOW DO YOU FIND?" AND THEY SAID, "GUILTY." MELINDA'S FATHER, HE CAME AND HUGGED ME. AND HE WAS JUST SOBBING, AND I JUST WILL NEVER FORGET HOW THAT FELT, YOU KNOW? THAT WAS HIS WAY OF SAYING "THANK YOU." IT WAS SO MOVING, AND SO TOUCHING. I'VE JUST NEVER FORGOTTEN HOW THAT FELT, THAT EMBRACE, BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THAT'S LIKE, TO LOSE A LOVED ONE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. I CAN'T IMAGINE. AND JUST, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, MELINDA WAS SO SWEET, AND SO HARD-WORKING, JUST A GOOD FRIEND, A GOOD WIFE, A GOOD DAUGHTER. [ QUIET MUSIC PLAYS ] MELINDA WAS 29 YEARS OLD, DOING NOTHING BUT HER JOB. Mike: NO. IT'S NOT JUSTICE FOR MELINDA. I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF US AND WHAT WE DID, AND I KNOW YOU'RE REJOICING IN HEAVEN. [ SOMBER MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES ] Schaefer: I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EVER ENVISIONS SOMEBODY THAT THEY LOVE BEING STABBED TO DEATH 60-SOME ODD TIMES AT WORK ON A FRIDAY MORNING. WHAT WOULD I SAY TO MELINDA RIGHT NOW? I'D TELL HER THAT I LOVED HER, AND THAT I WAS SORRY I WASN'T THERE WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY... ...TO AT LEAST HOLD HER HAND. MELINDA LOVED LIFE, AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT SHE WOULD WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO LEARN FROM THIS, AND NOT BE PUT IN A SITUATION WHERE THIS COULD HAPPEN. [ SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES ]
