 ♪♪ [ CHATTER ] I STARTED WORKING AT THE MUSEUM MARCH OF 2014. LOOK AT THAT. ANDREA STARTED WORKING AT THE MUSEUM IN NOVEMBER OF 2014. I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH HIS HAT AND HIS BEARD. MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF ANDREA WAS HER AMAZING POSITIVITY. NICE, VERY NICE. SHE WAS CALLED A "PLAYOLOGIST," IS WHAT IT'S CALLED. SHE COULD GO AND PLAY WITH THE KIDS IN THE DIFFERENT CENTERS. SHE LOVED WORKING WITH THE KIDS. NOW, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A STORY. [ CHEERING ] Fridrich: KIDS WERE JUST DRAWN TO HER,

 WITH THAT WONDERFUL PERSONALITY, BEING NICE TO EVERYONE, BEING WILLING TO JUST START A GAME WITH SOMEONE OR PUT ON A PLAY. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING. Farrington: ANDREA'S PERSONALITY WAS VERY BUBBLY. SHE WAS FRIENDLY, ALWAYS HAD A SMILE ON HER FACE, LAUGHED. NOW, THE SHOW IS OVER FOR TODAY, FOLKS, BUT TOMORROW, WE GET TO DRESS AS PIRATES. [ CHEERING ] Fridrich: THE MUSEUM OWNED THE GUEST-WELCOME CENTER, AND THAT WAS LOCATED KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MALL NEAR THE FOOD COURT. IT WAS KIND OF AN AREA JUST TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MALL AND THE TOWN. YOU CAN FIND THE FOOD COURT RIGHT OVER THERE. ANDREA WORKED QUITE FREQUENTLY AT THE GUEST-WELCOME CENTER, EVEN MORE SO THAN INSIDE THE MUSEUM. THE BATHROOM? UP THAT ESCALATOR TO THE RIGHT. YOU CAN'T MISS IT. A TYPICAL DAY AT THE GUEST-WELCOME CENTER WOULD BE RENTING OUT WHEELCHAIRS, KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH MALL SECURITY, AND THEN, ALSO, GIVING CUSTOMERS TIPS ON, LIKE, WHERE TO EAT OR WHERE TO GO. ♪♪ [ SOFT, ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Readshaw: WHEN ANDREA WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, SHE HAD AN OVERBITE AND AN ELONGATED JAW. A LOT OF PEOPLE MADE FUN OF HER FOR THAT. SHE WAS TEASED ALL THE TIME. WE LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN, SO EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY, AND THEY WOULD CALL HER NAMES. "WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THAT? YOU'RE UGLY." SHE WORKED AT A CONVENIENCE STORE IN OUR TOWN, AND AN OLDER GENTLEMAN HAD COME IN THERE, AND HE GOES, "WHY IS YOUR FACE LIKE THAT?" THIS IMAGE IS ANDREA'S BEFORE-AND-AFTER SURGERY PICTURES. IT CHANGED HER LIFE. IT CHANGED SO MANY THINGS ABOUT HER LIFE, AND IT GAVE HER SUCH CONFIDENCE. SHE FELT MORE SECURE IN THE FACT THAT SHE COULD SPEAK HER OPINION, AND IT ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE NEEDED TO LISTEN TO. CINEMA COMPLEX IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MALL. WALK STRAIGHT THAT WAY. Readhsaw: AFTER HER JAW SURGERY, THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION SHE GOT FROM OTHER PEOPLE DEFINITELY INCREASED, NOT ONLY JUST PEOPLE FROM AROUND HOME AND PEOPLE THAT HAD KNOWN HER PRIOR TO THE SURGERY, BUT ALSO FROM GUYS, AS WELL. HEY. YOU NEW? I'M ALEX. ALEX WAS A SECURITY OFFICER AT THE MALL. HE WOULD WALK KIND OF AROUND EVERYWHERE, AND HE ALWAYS STOPPED BY TO SOCIALIZE WITH ANDREA. HI. I'M ANDREA. YEAH. YEP. I'M NEW -- STARTED LAST WEEK AT THE MUSEUM. MY INITIAL THOUGHTS ABOUT ALEX WERE THAT, IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL. I HAVE LOTS OF GUY FRIENDS MYSELF, SO I JUST THOUGHT, AT FIRST, THAT HE WAS JUST ANOTHER FRIEND OF ANDREA'S, SOMEONE THAT HELPED HER GET THROUGH THE WORKDAY. LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER, YOU KNOW, FOR SECURITY REASONS. IT HELPS IF YOU CAN CALL AND REPORT ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS. OH. SURE. OKAY. WELL, I'LL ABSOLUTELY CALL IF I SEE ANYTHING. SEEING YOU'RE NEW AND ALL, COULD I GET YOUR NUMBER... FOR WHEN WE NEED YOUR HELP? IT WAS PRETTY COMMON FOR A PLAYOLOGIST TO GIVE OUT THEIR NUMBER TO A SECURITY GUARD, AND THEN, THEY CAN HELP THEM WITH ANYTHING THAT MAY BE GOING ON. SO, THAT WASN'T STRANGE TO ME. YEAH. SURE. I -- I TOTALLY GET IT. IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE. HERE. I GOT TO BE GOING. I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, ANDREA. SEE YOU, ALEX. ♪♪ ♪♪ - HEY. - HEY. ♪♪ ROB AND ANDREA WENT TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL, AND THEN, THEY STARTED DATING, AND THEN, THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER VERY QUICKLY AFTER THAT. BEFORE THE SURGERY, ANDREA AND ROB'S RELATIONSHIP WAS REALLY GREAT. THEY BOTH SEEMED VERY HAPPY TOGETHER. AFTER THE SURGERY, SHE WAS GETTING ALL THIS NEW ATTENTION THAT SHE HADN'T HAD BEFORE, AND I THINK THAT KIND OF MADE ROB INSECURE, A LITTLE BIT, ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. I THINK THAT STARTED TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM. HE KIND OF BECAME A LITTLE MORE WORRIED ABOUT WHO SHE WAS SPENDING HER TIME WITH AND WHERE SHE WAS. [ PHONE CHIMES ] A LOT OF THE TEXT MESSAGES THAT ALEX SENT TO HER, HE WOULD TELL HER THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL, THAT SHE WAS PRETTY, JUST A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS. SO, KIND OF GIVING HER THAT ATTENTION. HE WOULD CALL HER PET NAMES LIKE "BABE" AND "BABY." [ TEXT MESSAGE SENDS ] WHO ARE YOU TEXTING? NO ONE SPECIAL. I THINK HEARING THOSE COMPLIMENTS AFTER HER SURGERY REALLY MADE HER FEEL LIKE SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ WHO IS IT? IT'S JUST A FRIEND, OKAY? [ LAUGHS ] ♪♪ HOW ABOUT WE PAINT SOME TREES IN THE BACKGROUND? YEAH? WHAT COLOR ARE YOU GONNA PAINT THEM? [ PHONE CHIMES ] I DON'T THINK THAT THE TEXTING BETWEEN ANDREA AND ALEX WAS MEANT TO BE HARMFUL. SHE LIKED THE ATTENTION. SHE WAS JUST A FLIRTATIOUS PERSON. [ PHONE CHIMES ] BUT THAT WAS THE DAY THAT EVERYTHING CHANGED. [ PHONE CHIMES ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] [ DISTANTLY ] ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. I'M GONNA GO HOME, FINISH UP IN THE MORNING, OKAY? [ NORMAL VOLUME ] OKAY. Fridrich: ANDREA AND I WOULD TALK ABOUT JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING -- GUY PROBLEMS, IF I WAS HAVING A ROUGH DAY. KNOWING ANDREA, I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO BREAK UP ANY MARRIAGE. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE MARRIED. HEY, ANDREA.YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID. Readshaw: I DID FEEL UPSET FOR HER BECAUSE HE WAS ESSENTIALLY LEADING HER ON, AND YOU KNOW, MAKING HER FEEL WANTED, GIVING HER THAT POSITIVE ATTENTION, AND THEN, HITTING HER WITH THAT BOMBSHELL THAT HE IS MARRIED AND HE ALREADY HAS THAT COMMITMENT TO ANOTHER WOMAN. ANDREA, LOOK. I CAN..."HEY, BABE. HEY, BEAUTIFUL." WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU? I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU. I WAS SO HAPPY WITH HOW GOOD THIS IS, I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN THINGS. SHE WAS ANGRY ABOUT THE SITUATION. HE BUILT HER CONFIDENCE UP ONLY TO, KIND OF, TEAR IT DOWN. I THINK SHE WAS TOO NON-CONFRONTATIONAL TO TELL HIM THAT SHE WAS ANGRY THAT HE DID THAT. I'VE GOT TO GO. ANDREA WAS, MAYBE, HOPING THAT THEY WEREN'T MARRIED OR THEY WEREN'T STILL TOGETHER. BY LOOKING AT HIS SOCIAL MEDIA, SHE WAS HOPING TO UNCOVER WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS OR WASN'T MARRIED. - HE LOOKS PRETTY MARRIED. - UGH. WHEN ME AND ANDREA WERE LOOKING AT ALEX'S PAGE, WE WERE KIND OF SURPRISED AT WHAT WE SAW. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES ] HE SHARED A LOT OF ARTICLES AND STUFF ABOUT GUNS AND WEAPONS, AND HAD A LOT OF PHOTOS OF GUNS AND WEAPONS THAT HE OWNED, AS WELL. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THAT HE WAS PROBABLY A GOOD GUY TO BE HANGING AROUND, ESPECIALLY THAT HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS INTERESTED IN PURSUING SOMETHING ROMANTIC WITH HER. [ PHONE CHIMES ] YEAH, SO'S MINE. HOW ABOUT WE WATCH SOME TV? THE MORE THAT ANDREA FOUND OUT ABOUT ALEX, THE MORE UNCOMFORTABLE SHE BECAME WITH HIM AND THE IDEA OF EVEN BEING FRIENDS WITH HIM. Alex: HEY. I'VE BEEN MARRIED 4 MONTHS. IT'S NOT WORKING OUT. I LIKE YOU. WE HAVE FUN. I WAS THINKING MAYBE, YOU KNOW, SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE, YOU AND ME... YOU AND ME COULD BE MORE THAN FRIENDS. ANDREA HAD TOLD ME THAT ALEX HAD TALKED TO HER ABOUT HIS WIFE, AND THAT HE WAS NOT IN A HAPPY MARRIAGE, AND THAT HE HAD TALKED ABOUT LEAVING HIS WIFE SEVERAL TIMES. LOOK. LET'S RESET. YOU'RE MARRIED. I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP, TOO. LET'S JUST MOVE ON, OKAY? ANDREA DIDN'T WANT TO BE THAT PERSON. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN AS THE PERSON THAT BROKE UP THEIR MARRIAGE. SURE. YOU'RE RIGHT. FRIENDS? SHE WAS VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THAT, THAT... "DON'T PUT ME IN THIS POSITION," BASICALLY, IS HOW I FEEL SHE WOULD HAVE FELT. FRIENDS. UGH. HEY. CUT IT OUT. SEE YOU AROUND, BABE. ♪♪ [ CHATTER ] ♪♪ - DELIVERY. - OOH. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] ON VALENTINE'S DAY, ALEX HAD BOUGHT ANDREA FLOWERS. SHE WAS KIND OF FEARFUL ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND THAT HE WASN'T REALLY GETTING THE HINT THAT SHE WASN'T INTERESTED. AT THAT POINT, ANDREA WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SITUATION AND DEFINITELY WANTED ALEX TO BACK OFF. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE FOR ALEX TO HAVE BROUGHT ANDREA FLOWERS AT WORK. YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA. HE'S MARRIED. I SAID, "THROW THEM AWAY. DO NOT TAKE THEM HOME. DON'T TAKE THEM HOME, BECAUSE THAT'S JUST RUDE FOR ROB TO SEE FLOWERS THAT ANOTHER GUY GAVE TO HIS GIRLFRIEND." [ CHATTER ] HEY. HEY. BUT SHE DID TAKE THEM HOME BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO THROW THEM AWAY AT THE WELCOME CENTER BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT ALEX TO SEE THAT SHE HAD THROWN THEM AWAY. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] ♪♪ WHO'S ALEX? HE'S JUST SOME GUY I WORK WITH. I KNOW THAT ROB WAS UPSET. ANY MAN WOULD KIND OF BE UPSET IF ANOTHER MAN GAVE THEIR GIRLFRIEND OR WIFE OR WHATEVER FLOWERS. LOOK. THEY'RE JUST FLOWERS. IT'S NOTHING. THEY'RE... I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT THEM HOME. HE'S JUST SOME GUY. DO YOU LOVE ME? OF COURSE I DO. ROB AND ANDREA, THEY WERE KIND OF IN A RUT. IT WAS A ROCKY TIME AT THAT POINT. ♪♪ ♪♪ - OH, CASSIE. - HEY, ANDY. ANDREA'S SISTER LIKED TO VISIT ANDREA AT THE MALL A LOT, AND LIKE ME, SHE LIKED TO SURPRISE HER. "HEY. I'M IN TOWN. CAN WE HANG OUT? CAN WE TALK?" YOU OKAY? YEAH. YEAH. CASSIE COULD TELL ANDREA NEEDED A CONFIDENCE BOOSTER, AND I THINK SHE SUGGESTED TO ANDREA THAT, MAYBE, SHE SHOULD JUST GO TO A SALON AND HAVE SOMETHING DONE -- SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I'M BACK ON AT 2:30. THERE'S A PLACE RIGHT AROUND HERE. LET'S GO. - FABULOUS. HEY, I'M GONNA TRY THAT OUT FOR A BIT. Farrington: ANDREA WENT INTO THE SALON, AND RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THERE WERE MASSAGE CHAIRS. SO, I WAS THINKING, LIKE, UM, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE? [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES ] Andrea [DISTANTLY]: CASSIE? I'M BACK ON AT 2:30. THERE'S A PLACE RIGHT AROUND HERE. LET'S GO. - FABULOUS. NICE, THANK YOU. SEE YOU. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Cassie [DISTANTLY]: HEY, ANDREA. ♪♪ ♪♪ HE WAS...SPECIFIC. HE PAID ATTENTION TO WHAT CASSIE WAS WEARING, AND THAT'S JUST CREEPY. HE HAD BEEN WATCHING ALL THIS TIME. [ PHONE CHIMES ] Readshaw: AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH HIM FOLLOWING CASSIE, I DEFINITELY THING THAT ANDREA WAS STARTING TO THINK THAT HE WAS CREEPY. ANDREA WANTED TO BACK AWAY FROM ALEX. I MEAN, ONCE YOU KNOW HE'S WATCHING YOU, IT'S LIKE, YOU ALMOST FEEL IT ALL THE TIME. [ PHONE CHIMES ] SHE WAS TRYING TO BACK AWAY FROM HIM AT THAT POINT, AND HE DID NOT LISTEN. [ PHONE CHIMES ] HE'S SCARING ME. HE WON'T BACK OFF. ANDREA TALKED TO ANOTHER CO-WORKER OF ALEX'S ABOUT HIM COMING UP AND BOTHERING HER AT THE WELCOME CENTER. THANK YOU. I JUST NEED HIM TO STOP. AND SO, THIS CO-WORKER OF ALEX'S TOLD ALEX AND ANDREA THAT THEY NEEDED TO STOP TALKING TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS AFFECTING THEIR JOBS, AND IT NEEDED TO STOP. ALEX GOT SPOKEN TO TWICE, AT LEAST, TO LEAVE ANDREA ALONE. ANDREA WAS RELIEVED WHEN THEY TOLD HIM TO NOT COME AROUND THERE. IT DOESN'T MEAN HE DIDN'T, BECAUSE HE DID. HEY, BEAUTIFUL. ALEX, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PESTER ME AT WORK. YOUR SUPERVISOR IS WATCHING. ON ONE DAY, ALEX WENT TO THE WELCOME CENTER AND TALKED TO ANDREA BRIEFLY. IT'S TOO BAD. HEY, I'VE BEEN THINKING. YOU GOT ANY NUDES ON YOUR PHONE? IF SHE DID, HE WANTED HER TO SEND THEM TO HIM. AND IF SHE DIDN'T, HE WANTED HER TO TAKE SOME AND SEND THEM TO HIM. YOU'RE SICK. HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT ANSWER. THAT'S A CRYING SHAME. SHOW ME THE NUDES, OR I'LL BLOW UP YOUR CAR. HE SAID IT LIKE HE WAS JOKING, BUT SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A JOKE, AND SHE DIDN'T FIND IT FUNNY. [ LAUGHS ] I GOT YOU THERE, DIDN'T I? NO. I WOULDN'T DO A THING LIKE THAT, NOW, WOULD I, BABE? I THINK SHE WAS STARTING TO BECOME FRIGHTENED AT THAT POINT IN TIME. ♪♪ ♪♪ Officer: OKAY. ♪♪ ♪♪ Readshaw: I WOULD INVITE ANDREA AND ROB TO GO TO SOME COLLEGE PARTIES WITH ME OR TO HANG OUT WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS. ROB NEVER REALLY WANTED TO GO. I THINK THAT IT KIND OF UPSET HER THAT ROB DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT WITH US JUST 'CAUSE SHE WANTED HIM TO EXPLORE AND MEET NEW PEOPLE, AND THAT SORT OF THING. SHE WAS FINDING A LITTLE BIT OF INDEPENDENCE BEING ABLE TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS, AND I THINK THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF HER WANTING TO BE AWAY FROM ROB, TO SEE IF SHE COULD DO IT. SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT SHE REALLY LOVED ROB AS A PERSON, BUT SHE WASN'T IN LOVE WITH HIM ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ENDED UP BACK TOGETHER. THAT'S MY FEELING. ♪♪ NO WAY. HE'S PLAYING KANSAS CITY? WE'VE GOT TO GO. ANDREA AND CASSIE WERE TALKING ABOUT, POSSIBLY, GOING TO THE JASON ALDEAN CONCERT IN KANSAS CITY. WHOA. THAT'STHE CHEAPEST TICKET? THERE IS NO WAY I'VE GOT THAT. IF SHE HAD THE MONEY, SHE WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH JUST TO GO WATCH HIM IN CONCERT. THAT'S...SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM, YOU KNOW? MAYBE NEXT TIME HE'S PLAYING, I WON'T BE SO BROKE. BUT IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THEY JUST COULDN'T AFFORD IT. SO, I KNOW THAT ANDREA WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT SHE COULDN'T GO 'CAUSE SHE LOVED JASON. HEY. WE'D BETTER GO. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES ] ANDREA WAS FINISHING HER SHIFT UP, AND HEADED OUT TO HER CAR. [ OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS ] [ OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES ] ALEX? SHE FOUND A NOTE FROM ALEX, AND SHE WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT. SHE WAS SCARED. IT WAS A NOTE THAT ALEX HAD LEFT ON HER CAR OFFERING TO TAKE HER TO THE JASON ALDEAN CONCERT. SHE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO BE TERRIFIED, AT THAT POINT, BECAUSE THAT OBVIOUSLY MEANT THAT HE KNEW WHICH CAR SHE DROVE. [ ENGINE STARTS ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ANDREA HAD TEXT ME AND ASKED ME TO COME OVER AFTER WORK. SHE SAID, "ARE YOU BUSY TONIGHT? WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO COME OVER AND TALK?" I SAID, "I'M NOT TOO BUSY, NO. YEAH. I COULD." I THOUGHT THAT WAS ODD. THE DOOR WAS ALWAYS UNLOCKED WHEN I CAME OVER. [ KNOCKING ] SIERRA, THANK GOD. I'M SO SCARED. WHEN I ARRIVED AT ANDREA'S APARTMENT, SHE SEEMED FRANTIC, AND I COULD JUST TELL BY THE LOOK ON HER FACE THAT SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SOMETHING. LOOK. HE WON'T STOP, SIERRA. HE WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE. HE COULD BE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. SHE WAS VERY AFRAID BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW HE HAD KNOWN WHAT CAR SHE DROVE TO PUT THE NOTE ON HER CAR, AND THAT SHE HAD ASKED ME TO COME OVER BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID THAT, IF HE KNEW WHAT HER CAR LOOKED LIKE, THAT MAYBE HE HAD FOLLOWED HER HOME, ALSO. ♪♪ I WAS VERY AFRAID. I KEPT, KIND OF, PEEKING OUT THE BLINDS, MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS NOBODY, YOU KNOW, NO VEHICLES THERE THAT WEREN'T NORMALLY THERE. THERE WAS DEFINITELY A LOT OF PARANOIA, WITH HIM KNOWING WHAT HER CAR LOOKED LIKE, IF HE POTENTIALLY KNEW WHERE SHE LIVED, AS WELL. ♪♪ THAT NIGHT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST FRIGHTENED AND UPSET I HAVE EVER SEEN HER. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] ♪♪ CARLY, THIS GUY WAS INTENSE. I MEAN, HE'S MARRIED, BUT HE'S BUGGING ME, LIKE, EVERY DAY. ANDREA HAD MENTIONED THAT SHE INITIALLY KIND OF LIKED ALEX, BUT HE STARTED BECOMING PRETTY CREEPY, AND LEAVING NOTES ON HER CAR, AND JUST KIND OF BEING, LIKE, A STALKER. SO, SHE DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM AT THAT POINT IN TIME. ANYWAY, ENOUGH ABOUT ME. WE'RE STILL GOING SHOPPING LATER, RIGHT? I WAS SUPER EXCITED FOR MY SHIFT AT THE MUSEUM ON FRIDAY TO BE OVER BECAUSE I HAD PLANS TO HANG OUT WITH ANDREA. OH, WE'D BETTER GET TO WORK. WELCOME CENTER, 5:30? SEE YOU. HEY, BEAUTIFUL. WHAT'S NEW? ALEX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEAR ME? DON'T BE LIKE THAT WITH ME, BABE. YOU AND ME, WE'VE GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL. DON'T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN. Fridrich: I GOT TO THE GUEST-WELCOME CENTER TO KEEP ANDREA COMPANY. I ACTUALLY SWITCHED PLACES WITH HER, AND SHE WAS JUST SHOWING ME SOME POINTERS, SINCE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING OUT THERE LATER THAT WEEK. [ BOTH LAUGH ] OUR PLANS WERE NOT SET IN STONE THAT EVENING, BUT WE WERE DEFINITELY GONNA FIND TIME TO SEE EACH OTHER AFTER SHE WAS DONE HANGING OUT WITH HER DATE. ANYWAY, GOODBYE ALEX AND HELLO SHAWN, MY DATE FOR TONIGHT. THE GUY THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO SEE LATER THAT NIGHT WAS A MUTUAL FRIEND OF OURS, SO THAT MADE IT THAT MUCH MORE FUN TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT 'CAUSE I KNEW HIM, TOO. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] WHEN I WAS OUT AT THE MALL WITH ANDREA THAT NIGHT, NOTHING SEEMED OUT OF PLACE. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] I COULD HAVE NEVER PREDICTED THAT THAT DAY COULD END IN SUCH TRAGEDY. [ GUNSHOT ] Officer: SUSPECT IS GOING WEST THROUGH THE MALL. - GUNSHOTS. - WE HAVE A 9 MILLIMETER. [ GUNSHOT ] HEY, BEAUTIFUL. WHAT'S NEW? DON'T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] THE EVENING WAS, I MEAN, A TYPICAL FRIDAY NIGHT -- BUSY WITH PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, IN THE MALL SHOPPING, PEOPLE IN THE FOOD COURT EATING, PRETTY PACKED BECAUSE OF THE WEEKEND STARTING. DO YOU THINK HE LIKES PASTA? I REALLY WANT TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION. ANDREA AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HER UPCOMING DATE, AND JUST, HOW EXCITED SHE WAS, AND HOW EXCITED I WAS THAT EVENING TO GET TO HANG OUT WITH HER, TOO. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES ] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEAR THIS POP. [ GUNSHOT ] IMMEDIATELY AFTER I HEARD THE SOUNDS, I JUST SAW HER FALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES ] I SAW ALEX JUST TAKE OFF RUNNING. [ SCREAMING ] THE MALL WAS CHAOTIC. WHEN THE SHOTS WERE FIRED, EVERYONE WAS JUST RUNNING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THERE WERE PEOPLE RUNNING TO A STORE ON THE RIGHT SIDE, A STORE ON THE LEFT, JUST EVERY DIRECTION POSSIBLE -- OUTSIDE -- JUST AWAY FROM HIM. [ VOICE BREAKING ] I WAS SCARED, SO I NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THERE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE, AND I JUST LEFT. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] DON'T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN. Readshaw: ALEX DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE WARNINGS THAT HE WAS GIVEN. HE WAS STILL VERY PERSISTENT. [ PHONE CHIMES ] [ PHONE CHIMES ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ PHONE CHIMES ] SHE HAD WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM, AND YOU KNOW, ASKED HIM IF HE WAS MAD BY THAT, AND HE DEFINITELY WAS, BECAUSE HE SAID, "WELL, WHAT DO YOU MOTHER-EFFING THINK?" WE HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET, THAT HE WAS WANTING TO HURT HER. LIKE, I WAS IN COMPLETE SHOCK FROM THAT. I DO THINK THAT SHE HAD FELT LIKE SHE HAD FINALLY MADE THE POINT CLEAR, CUT, AND DRY. THAT WAS IT. THEY WEREN'T GONNA BE ANYTHING MORE. I FEEL LIKE SHE DID FINALLY PUT HER FOOT DOWN WITH ALEX, AND THEN, THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING ESCALATED. Officer: WHAT'S GOING ON? - GUNSHOTS. - WE HAVE A 9 MILLIMETER. SUSPECT IS GOING WEST THROUGH THE MALL, BY THE CAROUSEL. SUBJECT HAS GOT A BALL CAP ON, SOME KIND OF VEST. LAST INFORMATION, JUST NOW, IS THAT HE RAN OUT OF A RESTROOM EXIT. [ SIRENS WAILING ] UNITS ARRIVING, JUST BE ADVISED THAT I DON'T -- WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S AT RIGHT NOW. HE'S STILL LARGE UP HERE SOMEWHERE, POSSIBLY LEFT, MAYBE NOT. [ CHATTER ] [ SOMBER MUSIC PLAYS ] [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] WHEN I TRIED TO CALL AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER BOTH THE TIMES THAT I CALLED, I WAS KIND OF IN A PANIC, BECAUSE I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THAT WASN'T REALLY LIKE HER, TO NOT ANSWER HER PHONE. THIS WAS THE VOICEMAIL I LEFT MY MOM THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING, RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED. WHEN I LISTEN TO THE VOICEMAIL, IT TAKES ME RIGHT BACK TO THAT NIGHT, JUST ABSOLUTE HEARTBREAK, JUST GUT-WRENCHING FEELING, AND JUST THE WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD, THAT YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. YOU CAN'T BRING HER BACK. AND IT'S NOT FAIR THAT HE TOOK HER FROM ALL OF US. [ PHONE RINGING ] Farrington: ROB CALLED ME, AND ROB SAYS, "I NEED YOU TO COME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA HOSPITAL." "WHY? WHAT FOR?" HE SAYS, "ANDREA'S BEEN SHOT." AND OF COURSE, I SAY, "WHAT?" "ANDREA'S BEEN SHOT AT THE MALL." THIS TIME PERIOD, RIGHT HERE, I DON'T KNOW, REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. I KNOW I SCREAMED. I YELLED. WHAT, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T REMEMBER. I SAID... ..."CAN I SEE HER?" HER RIGHT HAND WAS OUT BESIDE HER, SO I GRABBED THAT. AND SHE WAS LAYING THERE. [ VOICE BREAKING ] SHE HAD BLOOD... SHE HAD BLOOD ON HER FACE. AND I COULDN'T GIVE HER A HUG. I JUST WANTED TO SCOOP HER UP AND HUG HER, AND I COULDN'T. Man: WE, THE JURY, FIND THE DEFENDANT, ALEXANDER MATTHEW KOZAK, GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE. Readshaw: IT'S HARD THAT ANDREA IS NO LONGER HERE. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF THINGS THAT I PICTURED US DOING TOGETHER, AND GROWING IN OUR FRIENDSHIP, AND IN LIFE. AND HER LIFE WAS DEFINITELY CUT WAY TOO SHORT. Farrington: I REPLAY JUNE 12TH IN MY MIND EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, I THINK ABOUT MY TWO DAUGHTERS. THANK GOD I STILL HAVE CASSIE. I SHOULD HAVE CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT. "LEAVE HER ALONE." TELL SOMEBODY HIGHER UP AT THE MALL, IN THE SECURITY DEPARTMENT, AND IF YOU HAVE TO, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. DO SOMETHING. DO SOMETHING. IF YOU HAVE ANY LITTLE BIT OF QUESTION ABOUT THE SAFETY, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. TALK ABOUT IT. DON'T JUST SHRUG IT OFF, BECAUSE THERE ARE BAD PEOPLE THAT DO BAD THINGS.
