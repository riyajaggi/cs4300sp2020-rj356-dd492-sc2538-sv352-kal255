 SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HER LIFE WAS IN DANGER. SHE'D TELL ME IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT WAS REALLY WRONG. WE FOUND 1,000 HOURS OF FOOTAGE. IT REVEALED THEM IN THE MOST INTIMATE OF SITUATIONS. FIRST THING I SAID TO THEM WAS, "HE KILLED HER." AND THEN HE WAS LIKE, "HOW DID YOU KNOW?" EMPLOYEES TRIED TO COMFORT EACH OTHER FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF A FELLOW WORKER, 31-YEAR-OLD KERRI HARRIS. SPLOTCHES OF THE BLACK POWDER USED TO LIFT FINGERPRINTS COULD BE SEEN ON THE DOORWAY INSIDE HER OFFICE.

 KERRI WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW JOB AT THE PROCESSING PLANT BECAUSE THIS JOB WAS THE PERFECT JOB FOR HER... HEY, EXCUSE ME, MISS. ...ONE, BECAUSE IT FIT HER CAREER FIELD, TWO, BECAUSE SHE WAS CLOSER TO HER FAMILY, AND THREE, SHE WAS CLOSER TO ME. CAN YOU SIGN IN? SURE. SHE WAS THE PROFESSIONAL, BUT I ALWAYS PICKED WITH HER BECAUSE I SAID SHE WAS, LIKE, THIS FOOD SCIENTIST-CHEMIST, LIKE, THE MAD SCIENTIST. I GOT THAT. SHE SAID THAT IT WAS JUST A NORMAL FIRST DAY MEETING NEW PEOPLE, FINDING OUT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO SIT,

 THOSE KIND OF THINGS. HI, KERRI? HI, WARREN. - HI. - GOOD TO SEE YOU. THIS IS THE E-MAIL THAT THE PROCESSING PLANT SENT OUT TO ALL THE EMPLOYEES WELCOMING KERRI AS THEIR NEWEST EMPLOYEE. IT, LIKE, HAD HER PICTURE ON THE FRONT OF IT, AND IT ALSO HAD, LIKE, A LITTLE MINIBIO ABOUT HER THAT WAS, LIKE, IN THERE FOR DESCRIBING WHAT SHE DID AND WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO WORK AT TO THE WHOLE COMPANY. SHE DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR THEM EVEN SENDING IT OUT THE WAY THEY DID. SHE DIDN'T NEED TO BE IN THE FOREFRONT. SHE WAS MORE OF A PERSON THAT WOULD PREFERRED TO HAVE WENT A DIFFERENT WAY, LIKE, GONE AROUND AND MET EVERYONE FIRST AND THEN KIND OF LIKE, "HERE, FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW, THIS IS KERRI." KERRI WAS NOT THE TYPE TO MIX BUSINESS WITH PERSONAL LIFE OR BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE. SHE WAS NOT THAT TYPE OF PERSON. SHE KEPT HER PERSONAL LIFE TO HERSELF. SHE KEPT FAMILY TO HERSELF. SHE KEPT HER FRIENDS TO HERSELF. IT WAS REALLY NO CROSSING. WHEN IT CAME TO STARTING NEW CHALLENGES FOR KERRI, IT WAS... THE NERVOUSNESS, I THINK, WAS THERE, BUT HER CONFIDENCE OVERSHONE HER NERVOUSNESS, ESPECIALLY TO OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WOULD SEE NOTHING BUT THIS SUPER STRONG WOMAN, AND I WOULD SEE BOTH SIDES. YEAH? COME IN. KERRI? YEAH? HI, I'M KERRI, AND YOU ARE? CRAIG. I SAW THE BOSS' E-MAIL, AND I JUST WANTED TO COME BY, INTRODUCE MYSELF. THERE WAS THIS GUY TO WELCOME HER TO HER NEW JOB. CAN I DO SOMETHING FOR YOU, CRAIG? WELL, YEAH. I MADE YOU THIS. WOW. YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO ALL THAT EFFORT. WHEN CRAIG BAKED THE CAKE FOR KERRI, I THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE GESTURE, A WELCOMING GESTURE. THANK YOU. CRAIG WAS A REALLY NICE GUY. HE WAS EASY TO TALK TO. HE SEEMED TO BE CARING OF OTHER PEOPLE, BUT KERRI DID NOT WANT TO EAT THE CAKE BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE FOOD SHE ATE FROM PEOPLE'S HOMES BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY KEPT THEIR KITCHEN, IF IT WAS CLEAN OR NOT. PLEASE, HELP YOURSELVES. WHEN KERRI FIRST STARTED AT THE JOB, SHE WOULD COME BACK AND FIND THINGS MOVED IN HER OFFICE. I WOULDN'T QUITE CALL IT AN OCD, BUT I WOULD SAY SHE WAS METICULOUS. WHEN IT CAME TO PROFESSIONAL THINGS, EVERYTHING WAS IN PLACE. THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE THING THAT COULD EVER BE OUT OF PLACE. SHE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHO WAS DIRECTLY DOING IT, BUT SHE DIDN'T LEAVE ANYTHING IMPORTANT AT WORK. SORRY, WARREN. YOU SCARED ME. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH, ALL GOOD. THANKS, WARREN. MYSELF AND KERRI, WE TALKED ON THE PHONE ALMOST EVERY DAY ON THERE FOR WHETHER IT WAS HER CALLING ME AT HER LUNCHTIME THAT SHE HAD A BREAK FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES BECAUSE SHE WOULD SAY, WELL... I SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" SHE WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING OUT TO MY CAR TO HAVE MY LUNCH," OR, "I'M GOING DOWN TO THE LOCAL PLACE," OR SHE'D GO TO A PARK. ONE EVENING, SHE HAD SOME FRIENDS SHE WAS GOING TO BE GOING OUT WITH AND HAVING A GOOD TIME, AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT AT WORK. I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HER, AND SHE WAS GOING HOME. HEY, JASON. YOU WORKING LATE AGAIN? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU WORK TOO HARD. NO. YOU KNOW YOU DO. NO. IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT CONVERSATION, SHE'S DRIVING, AND IT KIND OF, LIKE... SHE JUST KIND OF PAUSES. UM... OKAY. I'M LIKE, "HEY. YOU STILL THERE?" SHE'S LIKE, "YEAH. I'M STILL HERE," AND I'M LIKE, "WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" SHE'S LIKE, "I THINK A CAR IS FOLLOWING ME." SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS BEING FOLLOWED SEVERAL TIMES WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING WORK. I SAID, YOU KNOW, "IS IT SOMEBODY YOU KNOW?" SHE WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T REALLY MAKE IT OUT, BUT IT'S GETTING CLOSE, AND EVERY PLACE I'M TURNING IT'S TURNING," AND I'M LIKE, "WELL, A LOT OF TIMES, PEOPLE HAVE WHERE THEY'RE JUST NOT REALLY FOLLOWING YOU, BUT THEY'VE GOT TO WEAVE THEIR WAY OUT THE SAME WAY YOU DO." LOOK, I KEEP TURNING. I'VE TAKEN A COUPLE OF SIDE ROADS. THEY'RE STILL THERE. I SAID, "DRIVE YOURSELF AROUND. BE SURE YOU STAY ON A WELL-LIT ROAD, AND TAKE YOURSELF TO THE NEAREST POLICE STATION, AND PULL IN THERE AND SEE IF THEY FOLLOW YOU." AND THEN, RIGHT AS SHE WAS GETTING NEAR THE POLICE STATION, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HER TURNED OFF. IS EVERYTHING OKAY, MA'AM? YEAH, YEAH. SORRY, OFFICER. IT'S A STRESSFUL DAY. OKAY. DRIVE SAFE NOW, KERRI WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET. I MEAN, THE GIRL STARTED READING AT THE AGE OF 3. AND THEN, BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE AGE OF 5, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS HAVING THESE 300-PAGE BOOKS THAT SHE WAS GETTING 10 AT A TIME FROM THE LOCAL LIBRARY AND TAKING THEM HOME AND READING THEM IN A FEW DAYS AND TAKING THEM BACK. IT WAS AMAZING. I MET KERRI IN COLLEGE, AND WE WERE STAYING IN THE SAME DORM TOGETHER. WE JUST CLICKED. IT WAS EFFORTLESS. WE FOUND A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON, TRAVEL, BASICALLY TALK ABOUT HOW WE WANTED TO TRAVEL AFTER WE GRADUATED. THIS PICTURE MEANS A LOT TO ME. THIS IS ONE OF THE VACATIONS THAT KERRI AND I TOOK TO THE BEACH. IT WAS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE PLACES. WE LOVED THE WATER. WE LOVED THE SUN. SHE WAS MY TRAVEL PARTNER. SHE WAS THE ONE THAT I DID EVERYTHING WITH. AS A QUALITY-CONTROL MANAGER, IT WAS KERRI'S JOB AT THE PROCESSING PLANT WHERE THEY MADE A FOOD ADDITIVE TO TEST ALL ASPECTS OF IT AND ENSURE IT WAS SHIPPED OUT PROPERLY. SHE TOUCHED EVERY ASPECT OF THE OPERATION. KERRI WAS A VERY METICULOUS PERSON THAT STRIVED FOR PERFECTION IN EVERYTHING THAT SHE DID AND EVERYTHING THAT HAD HER STAMP APPROVAL TO IT. IF IT DIDN'T GO OUT WITH HER LEVEL OF QUALITY TO IT, THEN IT WOULDN'T LEAVE. WHEN KERRI FIRST STARTED HAVING CAR PROBLEMS, SHE SAID, "JAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY CAR, YOU KNOW. I'M STARTING TO HAVE ALL THESE WEIRD LITTLE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS." IT WAS VERY ODD. SHE HAD ONE INSTANCE WHERE THE CAR ITSELF WOULDN'T START AT WORK. CRAIG CAME OUT AND THEN LOOKED UNDERNEATH THE HOOD AND HELPED HER WITH IT, AND IT STARTED UP. YOU KNOW, SHE HAD ALREADY HAD AAA, SO SHE HAD SOMEONE COME OUT, BUT SHE WAS THANKFUL BECAUSE HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT. SORRY. WHAT'S ALL THIS? CRAIG BOUGHT KERRI SOME FLOWERS, AND HE SEEMED TO BE VERY INTERESTED IN HER. WELL, I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO OUT FOR A DRINK SOMETIME. SHE WASN'T INTERESTED IN CRAIG BUT DID NOT LIKE TO HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS. THAT'S SWEET, AND THE FLOWERS ARE NICE, BUT I DON'T DATE COWORKERS. WHEN CRAIG GAVE HER FLOWERS AND SHE TOLD THEM THAT THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, NOT A GESTURE THAT SHE WAS ACCEPTING OF, HE WAS NOT HAPPY. AW, COME ON. LOOK, I'VE GOT A MEETING TO GET TO IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES. ALL RIGHT? KERRI SAID, "HE POUTED AWAY LIKE A LITTLE CHILD." I TOLD HER IT WAS ODD. THANKS. FINE. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT, IF IT WASN'T IN A PROFESSIONAL SETTING, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING WITH HIM. "THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE GESTURE, BUT IT'S NOTHING THAT I'M LOOKING FOR." CRAIG WANTED KERRI TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN HIM THAN SHE WAS, AND SO HE WOULD PURSUE HER. YOU KNOW, HE WOULD TRY TO TAKE HER OUT ON DATES. HE WANTED A RELATIONSHIP. SHE DID NOT RETURN THOSE FEELINGS, AND SHE WISHED HE WOULD STOP PURSUING HER. THERE WAS A PARTICULAR INCIDENT WHERE MY MOTHER HAD WENT OUT AND ACTUALLY BOUGHT HER A SET OF DIAMOND EARRINGS. IT WAS FOR HER BIRTHDAY. NICE EARRINGS. YEAH, YOU KNOW, GIFT. AND THEY WERE CUTE, A LITTLE NICE SET, YOU KNOW, A NICE MOTHER-TO-DAUGHTER GIFT. HEY. SORRY. I JUST WANTED TO SAY, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY." CRAIG WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A BIGGER, BETTER SET OF EARRINGS. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY WERE DIAMOND OR NOT, BUT KERRI FLAT-OUT REFUSED. I'M SORRY. NO, I CAN'T ACCEPT THEM. HE JUST DID WANT TO STEP BACK FROM HER. IN ESSENCE, SHE WAS JUST SAYING THAT, "I DON'T WANT TO DATE YOU." I'LL LEAVE THEM IN MY OFFICE FOR WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND. I CAME BACK TO KERRI. IT SOUNDED LIKE, YOU KNOW, SHE NEEDED ME TO COME DOWN THERE AND HAVE A TALK WITH SOMEBODY, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "NO, JAY. DON'T DO IT. THERE'S NO NEED. I'VE GOT THIS HANDLED." KERRI WENT TO HR TO INFORM THEM OF CRAIG'S INFATUATION. UM, HI. IT WAS STARTING TO GET OUT OF HAND. SHE FELT LIKE THAT WOULD SOLVE HER PROBLEMS WITH CRAIG. SHE FELT THAT THEY COULD GIVE HER GUIDANCE ON HOW TO HANDLE THE SITUATION. THEY GAVE CRAIG DIRECTION AS WELL AS A WRITE-UP IN HIS PERSONNEL FILE, AND THE DIRECTION THAT THEY GAVE HIM WAS, UNLESS IT WAS WITH DIRECTLY OFFICIAL BUSINESS, THAT THERE WAS NO INTERACTION THAT HE'D REALLY NEED TO HAVE WITH KERRI. SHE KNEW THEY HAD TALKED TO HIM BECAUSE THEY TOLD HER THAT HE WAS GOING TO GO, YOU KNOW, LICK HIS WOUNDS AND MOVE OFF ON HIS OWN WAY. KERRI WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN RESOLVED. HEY. I'M SORRY I'M LATE. THANKS. SO, THANKS FOR THIS. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I NEEDED A DRINK. SHE CONFIDED IN HER THAT SHE WAS AWARE THAT CRAIG WAS INFATUATED WITH HER, AND SHE HAD FOUND OUT SOME HORRIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT CRAIG THAT SHE HAD TO SHARE WITH KERRI. WHAT? WHAT IS IT? I THINK THE COWORKER WAS SCARED FOR KERRI BECAUSE SHE KNEW THIS WAS TRUE. KERRI CALLED ME THAT EVENING AND TOLD ME THAT HER COWORKER HAD JUST TOLD HER THAT CRAIG HAD SPENT TIME IN PRISON FOR MANSLAUGHTER OF A GIRL. I WAS SHOCKED. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS, LIKE, I NEEDED TO VERIFY, SO I DID SOME RESEARCH AND LOOKED UP HIS NAME, LOOKED UP NEW JERSEY, LOOKED UP THE GIRL'S NAME THAT SHE GAVE AND FOUND OUT IT WAS TRUE. HE HAD COMMITTED THIS HORRENDOUS CRIME. CRAIG WAS ABLE TO KEEP HIS CRIMINAL PAST A SECRET FROM THOSE AROUND HIM. HE HAD COMPLETED HIS SENTENCE. HE WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. HE WAS NO LONGER IN JEOPARDY. HIS COWORKERS DESCRIBED HIM AS A NICE GUY. IT WAS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING. YOU HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF MIXED EMOTIONS BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEND WHO YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO IS NOW WORKING WITH A KILLER. I WANTED HER TO FIND ANOTHER JOB. I WANTED HER TO TRANSFER. I DIDN'T CARE WHERE SHE WENT. SO WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT KERRI GOT HER MASTER'S DEGREE, I WAS OVER THE MOON. IT JUST WAS A SOLIDIFICATION FOR HER AS AN ACHIEVEMENT IN HER INDUSTRY. THIS IS KERRI ON HER GRADUATION DAY. I KNOW SHE WAS FULL OF PRIDE, AND I WAS FULL OF PRIDE FOR HER THAT THIS IS SOMETHING SHE HAD FINALLY WORKED SO HARD FOR, STRUGGLED HERSELF THROUGH AND MADE HAPPEN. HEY! HI. SO HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND? DO ANYTHING FUN? NO, I MEAN, NOTHING EXCITING. GROWING UP WITH ME AND KERRI, THERE WAS ALWAYS A DIRECT SORT OF COMPETITION THAT WE HAD ON CERTAIN THINGS, THAT BANTER BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN US ON THAT FOR BEING WHICH ONE WAS GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO MAKE SOME MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT IN OUR LIFE AND THAT NEW MILESTONE, AND HONESTLY, I HAVE TO SAY MY LITTLE SISTER BEAT ME. KERRI, CAN I BORROW YOU FOR A SECOND? YEAH, SURE. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. WHEN KERRI WAS FINISHING OFF HER MASTER'S DEGREE. BEING THE PERSON THAT SHE WAS, SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW. YOU KNOW, SHE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE ON HER OWN TIME, HER OWN SPACE. WHAT'S ALL THIS? CONGRATULATIONS. HER BOSS SAYS, "HEY, EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE. LET'S ALL CONGRATULATE KERRI. SHE JUST FINISHED OFF HER MASTER'S DEGREE." SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE DID THAT TO HER. THANK YOU. HEY, KERRI. CONGRATULATIONS. WHEN CRAIG FOUND OUT ABOUT KERRI GETTING HER MASTER'S DEGREE, HE WENT OUT IN TRUE FASHION AND WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND ABSURD, AND HE BOUGHT HER A GIFT. FOR KERRI'S GRADUATION GIFT, CRAIG PURCHASED A DIGITAL ORGANIZER FOR HER. IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE GIFT. WOW, YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE. KERRI WAS WORRIED ABOUT UPSETTING CRAIG AFTER HEARING ABOUT HIS CRIMINAL PAST. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET HIM IN ANY WAY. SHE DID WANT TO GIVE IT BACK TO HIM, BUT SHE ALSO WANTED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DIDN'T TICK HIM OFF. LOOK, I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS. IT'S TOO MUCH. YOU CAN AND YOU WILL. I'M NOT TAKING IT BACK THIS TIME. EXCUSE ME. I'VE GOT A MEETING. THANK YOU AGAIN. EXCUSE ME. WHEN KERRI TOLD ME ABOUT THIS, I WAS LIVID. I SAID, "THAT IS NOT A GIFT FOR SOMEBODY TO GIVE YOU FROM WORK AT ALL." WELL, NOW I SAYS, "WHO IS THIS GUY?" I SAID, "NO, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM," AND I SAID, "YOU NEED TO WATCH YOURSELF." I SAID, "YOU"... SHE SAID, "JAY, I AM. I'M WATCHING OUT FOR MYSELF." I SAID, "NO. NO." I SAID, "YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THIS. YOU DON'T JUST HAVE TO WATCH YOURSELF FROM THE FRONT. YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOURSELF FROM THE SIDES AND FROM THE BACK, YOU KNOW, WITH SOMEBODY LIKE THIS BECAUSE THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH OF A GIFT." I TRULY BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS HEAVILY CONCERNED AND SCARED, BUT I PUT IT TO THE SIDE. I SAID, "NO, SHE'D TELL ME IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT WAS REALLY WRONG," AND THAT WAS THAT, THINKING THAT WE WERE GOING TO TALK AGAIN. KERRI, ARE YOU OKAY? THAT CONVERSATION NEVER CAME. KERRI, ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M FINE. IT'S JUST I'M JUST A LITTLE OVERWHELMED. A FEMALE COWORKER OF KERRI'S HAD WENT TO THE RESTROOM. WELL, WHILE IN THE RESTROOM, SHE NOTICED SOMETHING ON A SHELF, AND IT CAUGHT HER CURIOSITY. WHAT IS... IT WAS A FLASHING RED LIGHT. IT WAS COMING FROM A MAKEUP BAG. IS THAT A CAMERA? THE CAMERA WAS IN A COMPACT BAG, SANITARY NAPKINS ON TOP OF IT SO THAT THERE WAS A DIRECT IMAGE OF THE LADIES AS THEY WENT TO THE RESTROOM. IT REVEALED THEM IN THE MOST INTIMATE OF SITUATIONS. KERRI WAS HORRIFIED. SHE FELT VIOLATED, AND IT WAS AN INVASION OF HER PRIVACY. SHE SAID, "WHAT KIND OF PSYCHOTIC, CREEPY PERSON WOULD ACTUALLY PUT A CAMERA IN THE LADIES' RESTROOM?" YOU KNOW, RESTROOMS FOR WOMEN ARE BONDING PLACES. WE GO TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, WE PUT OUR MAKEUP ON IN THERE. WE GET CHANGED IN RESTROOMS. WE DO EVERYTHING IN THE RESTROOM, AND TO FIND OUT THAT ONE OF MY COWORKERS HAD PLACED A CAMERA IN THERE WHERE I'M AT MY MOST VULNERABLE, THE LEVEL OF INVASION... I ACTUALLY -- I REALLY -- I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THAT. SHE DIDN'T TELL ME. IF I WAS TOLD THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN SETTING UP A CAMERA IN THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM AND WATCHING HER, I'D HAVE BEEN ON THE ROAD, DRIVING DOWN THERE, TRYING TO YANK HER UP AND MOVE HER HOME. KERRI AND THE ASSOCIATE THAT FOUND THE CAMERA WENT TO HR HIGHER-UP, AND AT THE TIME, NO ONE WAS PRESENT, SO KERRI SECURED THE CAMERA, AND THE NEXT MORNING, SHE AND THE COWORKER REPORTED TO HR. ON THAT FRIDAY MORNING, KERRI WAS WALKING OVER TO HR'S OFFICE WITH THE CAMERA. CRAIG ACTUALLY WAS WALKING PAST HER, GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, HEADING TOWARD HER BUILDING. SHE AND THE COWORKER REPORTED TO HR. HR CONTACTED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THE POLICE WERE IMMEDIATELY ON THE SCENE. THEY WERE HORRIFIED ONCE THEY REALIZED THAT THIS CAMERA HAD BEEN THERE. NO ONE KNEW HOW LONG. AFTER KERRI AND HER COWORKER TURNED OVER THE CAMERA TO HR, KERRI SIMPLY WENT BACK TO WORK. SHE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE, BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE THAT WE INVESTIGATED, THAT WE DISCOVERED, THAT HER LIFE WAS IN DANGER, SO SHE WENT TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY PAID HER TO DO. THE ABSOLUTELY UNFORTUNATE THING FOR KERRI IS THAT, AT THE TIME, SHE HAD NO CLUE WHO HAD PUT THE CAMERA IN THE STALL. CRAIG HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE THAT DAY. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, CRAIG? HEY, BOSS. I'M NOT FEELING SO WELL, AND I THINK I'M GOING TO HEAD OFF HOME. OKAY. NO PROBLEM. YOU KNOW, HE'D SEEN THE POLICE COME AND LEAVE. "THEY'RE GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE CAMERA. THEY'RE GOING TO DUST IT FOR PRINTS. THEY'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IT WAS ME." WE FOUND HE HAD COMPILED A COMPACT DISC, THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF FOOTAGE, WHICH BASICALLY COVERED EVERY DAY THAT THAT CAMERA WAS IN THE RESTROOM. CRAIG HAD TAKEN THE IDENTIFICATION PICTURES OF HIS COWORKERS, PLACED THEM ON THE COVER OF COMPACT DISC CASES AND GIVEN EACH OF HIS COWORKERS THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL FILES WHERE HE DOWNLOADED ALL OF THE PICTURES FROM THE CAMERA. EMPLOYEES TRIED TO COMFORT EACH OTHER FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF A FELLOW WORKER. 31-YEAR-OLD KERRI HARRIS WAS INSIDE HER OFFICE WHEN ANOTHER EMPLOYEE, CRAIG ARMSTEAD, ALLEGEDLY ATTACKED HER WITH A KNIFE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, GETTING CALLED TO A WORKPLACE TO INVESTIGATE A WORKPLACE MURDER IS NOT AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE, AND THE POLICE WERE IMMEDIATELY ON THE SCENE. THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY PUT OUT WHAT WE CALL A BOLO, A BE-ON-THE-LOOKOUT, FOR CRAIG ARMSTEAD, AND THEY WERE ABLE TO APPREHEND HIM IN SHORT ORDER. I JUST FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG. LIKE, I COULDN'T BREATHE. I LOST... I LOST MYSELF. I ACTUALLY GOT UP OUT OF THE MEETING THAT I WAS IN. JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN, EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT ME LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING... AND I HAD TO WALK OUTSIDE, AND IT WAS RAINING OUTSIDE, AND I WALKED OUTSIDE, AND RIGHT AS I GOT OUTSIDE, THE RAIN WAS COMING DOWN. IT JUST KIND OF STOPPED. AT THAT POINT, I COLLAPSED. AT THAT MOMENT, I TOLD THEM MY NAME, AND HE TOLD ME AT THAT MOMENT, HE SAYS, "I'M SORRY, MR. HARRIS, TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SISTER, KERRI, WAS MURDERED TODAY." I SAID, "DO YOU HAVE HIM?" HE SAID, "YES," YOU KNOW, "WE CAUGHT HIM." WE BELIEVE THAT CRAIG SAW KERRI WALKING TO HR, AND WHEN HE SAW THEM WALKING TO HR, HE PANICKED. HE KNEW THAT HIS GIG WAS UP, AND IT IS THEN THAT HE BEGAN TO PLOT THE MURDER OF KERRI. CRAIG MURDERED KERRI WITH A WEAPON THAT HE FOUND AT THE JOB, A BUTCHER KNIFE. THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS LIKELY THAT SHE NEVER SAW IT COMING, AND HE LEFT HER IN HER OFFICE. HE LEFT HER ALONE. HER COWORKERS WERE ONLY FEET AWAY, JUST A FEW FEET AWAY. THEY WERE HAVING A LUNCH MEETING. CRAIG DID NOT CARE. THEY HEARD HER SCREAMS. THEY HEARD THE COMMOTION. AFTER THEY HEARD HER SCREAMS, THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEY SAW CRAIG FLEEING. COWORKERS WENT INTO KERRI'S OFFICE, AND SHE WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR, KNIFE STUCK THROUGH HER NECK, NO LONGER BREATHING. CRAIG HAD KILLED HER. KERRI'S FAMILY CALLED ME, AND THE FIRST THING I SAID TO THEM WAS, "HE KILLED HER," AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE KILLED HER?" AND I WAS LIKE, "HE KILLED HER. CRAIG KILLED HER," AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE, "HOW DID YOU KNOW?" IN 1992, HE PLEADED GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY TO THE MURDER OF HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND IN NEW JERSEY. HE SERVED 5 YEARS OF A 10-YEAR MANSLAUGHTER SENTENCE. HE WAS A SICK INDIVIDUAL. SHE WAS ANOTHER PERSON THAT WAS ON THE TOP OF HER WORLD AND MOVING FORWARD WITH HER LIFE, READY TO SET THE WORLD ON FIRE, JUST LIKE MY SISTER, AND HE TOOK HER AWAY, TOO. ARMSTEAD'S RECORD ALSO SHOWS A FELONY PEEPING TOM CONVICTION IN CLAYTON COUNTY IN 1999. I WAS THERE WHEN THE TRIAL HAPPENED FOR CRAIG ARMSTEAD. I WAS THERE EVERY DAY. CRAIG HAS NEVER SHOWN AN OUNCE OF REMORSE, REGRET, OR SORROW THAT HE DID WHAT HE'S DONE. CRAIG'S DEFENSE WAS ONE OF LEGAL INSANITY. LUCKILY FOR KERRI AND HER FAMILY, THAT DID NOT WORK, AND THE JURORS SAW THROUGH THAT, CONVICTING HIM ON ALL ACCOUNTS. ONCE CRAIG REALIZED THAT THE CAMERA HAD BEEN FOUND, HE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF KERRI KNOWING THAT IT WAS HIM. HE WAS ATTRACTED TO KERRI. HE WANTED TO DATE KERRI. HE WANTED TO BE KERRI'S BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS NOT ATTRACTED TO HIM, SO ONCE THE DISCOVERY WAS MADE, CRAIG DECIDED HE HAD TO KILL HER INSTEAD OF HER KNOWING THAT IT WAS HE THAT PUT THE CAMERA IN THE STALL. I FEEL THAT ANY COMPANY THAT WANTS TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT IS LIKE THAT WORK FOR THEM, THEY SHOULD INFORM THE PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM THE CHOICE OF WHAT THEY WANT TO WORK NEXT TO AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE WITH. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T JUST TAKE AND HAVE SOMEONE HANGING OUT IN THIS WORLD NEXT TO YOU THAT IS A THREAT. SHE HAD SO MUCH TO OFFER. SHE WAS... WE HAD SO MANY PLANS TO TRAVEL, TO DO THINGS, AND HE TOOK HER AWAY FROM US. THERE'S JUST AN EMPTINESS, A VOID THAT CAN'T BE FILLED BY ANYONE ELSE. MY SISTER WAS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON. WHEN IT CAME TO KNOWING SOMEONE AND WANTING TO SAY THAT I HAD SOMEBODY IN MY LIFE THAT WAS A TRUE FRIEND, A TRUE PERSON, A GOOD PERSON, THAT WAS MY SISTER, KERRI. SHE WAS A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. THE ONE THING THAT I'M THANKFUL FOR IS THAT MY SISTER, KERRI, AND I, WE ENDED EVERY CONVERSATION THAT WE EVER HAD WITH THE WORDS, "I LOVE YOU," AND IF THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING THAT I COULD TELL KERRI RIGHT NOW AND SAY TO HER IS THAT, "I MISS YOU. I WISH I COULD HAVE SAVED YOU FROM THIS. I HOPE THAT YOUR SOUL IS AT PEACE AND THAT, WHEREVER YOU ARE, THAT YOU KNOW, AS ALWAYS, THAT I LOVE YOU."
