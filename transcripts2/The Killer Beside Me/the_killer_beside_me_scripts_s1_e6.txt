 TO TELL ME ABOUT GENE. SHE JUST SAID THAT GENE HAD BEEN TAKEN. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS. SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED FOR SURE, AS FAR AS IF HE WAS OKAY OR NOT. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] OKAY, THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD, BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY COULD STILL BE OKAY. GENE COULD STILL BE OKAY. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] IF WE COULD GET TO HIM, YOU KNOW, COULD HE BE SAVED?

[ CRYING ] BUT YOU STILL HAVE THIS MINUTE HOPE THAT EVERYTHING'S OKAY. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ GENE'S WIFE -- SHE ACTUALLY ENDED UP LEAVING GENE AND GOING BACK TO HER EX. IT HURT GENE A LOT, BECAUSE AT THE TIME, SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM A TERMINAL ILLNESS.

HE HAD COME FROM THE AIR FORCE AND HAD BEEN A CONTROLLER WITH THEM. SYSTEM -- NOVEMBER, ALFA, TANGO, 6. WE SHOW YOU 90 KNOTS -- NINE-ZERO KNOTS -- ACROSS THE GROUND. THIS WAS GENE WHEN WAS IN THE AIR FORCE. HE WAS ACTUALLY EXCITED WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE AIR FORCE JUST TO START OUT AND SEE WHAT HE COULD DO WITH HIS TRAINING. GENE THRIVED ON THE PRESSURE. HE LIKED IT A LOT. Adams: HIS FATHER HAD BEEN MY TRAINER MANY YEARS BEFORE, SO I FELT I HAD A KINSHIP THERE. GENE DROPPED THE ODD COMMENT NOW AND THEN THAT HIS MARRIED LIFE WASN'T AS HE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. BUT GENE ALWAYS KEPT HIS JOB AND HIS FAMILY LIFE SEPARATED, AND YOU NEVER REALLY KNEW ANYTHING WAS WRONG AT HOME. [ ENGINE ROARING ] ♪♪ ♪♪ HEY, GUYS. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE. THEY'RE ONLY A COUPLE MONTHS OLD. OH, HEY. BOB. TAKE A LOOK. Adams: BOB PETERSON WAS A DOG LOVER. [ Chuckling ] OH, WOW. SO CUTE. OH, YEAH. HERE'S A PICTURE OF GENE WITH HIS PUPPIES. SOMETIMES HE'D BRING THEM INTO THE FLIGHT-SERVICE STATION, HIDE A BALL, AND THEY'D GO FIND IT. WE ENJOYED WATCHING THEM. BEAUTIFUL, HUH? CAN I BUY ONE? WOULD YOU SELL ONE? TO ME. UM...SURE. UH, I CAN'T LOOK AFTER ALL OF THEM. THEY WORKED OUT A DEAL WHERE BOB GOT A PUPPY FROM GENE, AND FROM THEN ON, THEY KIND OF STRUCK UP A FRIENDSHIP. IT WASN'T CLOSE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEY DIDN'T GO OUT AND SOCIALIZE. THEY JUST WERE FRIENDS BECAUSE OF THE PUPPIES. THANKS, BOB. ACTUALLY, OUTSIDE OF WORK, WE NEVER SAW BOB. WE JUST SORT OF FIGURED THAT HE'S A LONER AT WORK AND THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO BE. ♪♪ [ ENGINE ROARS ] ♪♪ AFTER FOUR YEARS OF BEING IN NEBRASKA, GENE FINALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO FLORIDA. IT WAS HIS CHANCE FINALLY TO GET AWAY AND START ANEW. Adams: THE AIR AROUND HIM WAS A LITTLE TENSE, AND I SAID, "HEY, WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT AND HAVE A HAMBURGER AND A CUP OF COFFEE WITH US?" LARRY, I NEED TO BREAK SOME NEWS TO YOU. YOU NEED TO KNOW I'M TRANSFERRING TO ST. PETE'S NEXT YEAR. MY OTHER BROTHER, MY SISTER, AND MYSELF HAD ALL BEEN IN FLORIDA NOW. MY PARENTS FINALLY BOUGHT A HOUSE IN FLORIDA. DAD WAS RETIRING AND FINALLY MOVING DOWN TO FLORIDA. AND THEN GENE WAS THE LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE, GETTING HIM DOWN. HE THOUGHT THAT, BY GETTING A NEW SURROUNDING, THAT, POSSIBLY, THINGS WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM. I'M SORRY, LARRY. Adams: WE DISCUSSED IT A COUPLE TIMES, AND HE SAYS, "IT'S GONNA BE GREAT. I'M NOT GONNA HAVE TO PUT UP WITH ANY WINTER." WE WERE ALL GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE WAS GONNA MAKE A NEW LIFE FOR HIMSELF. ♪♪ Woman: ...CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF...

AND MY OLDEST DAUGHTER -- SHE WAS PROBABLY ABOUT 17. IT WAS LIKE I WAS READY TO DATE. I WANTED TO BE WITH SOMEBODY. SO, AGAIN, I KIND OF LIKE SAT BACK AT WORK AND KIND OF ASSESSED MY SELECTIONS. [ LAUGHS ] AND I LOOKED AT GENE AGAIN, AND I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS MAN HAS TREMENDOUS CHARACTER. IT WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I'LL JUST ASK HIM OUT FOR COFFEE OR TEA. HOW BAD CAN THAT GO?" AND NEARBY WORK, THERE WAS, LIKE, A 24-HOUR BREAKFAST PLACE THAT WOULD STAY OPEN, SO I JUST HAPPENED TO GET THE COURAGE UP AND ASK HIM. AND HE SAID YES, WHICH WAS, LIKE, WAY COOL. ♪♪ MY CHILDREN WERE VERY HAPPY FOR ME. THE LITTLE BIT THAT THEY GOT TO KNOW GENE, THAT HE WAS A REALLY GOOD PERSON. THAT WAS HEARTWARMING -- TO SEE A VERY GOOD MALE INFLUENCE ON MY BOYS. ♪♪ IT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO THEN -- TO GO FROM BEING CO-WORKERS TO START DATING.

HEY. ♪♪ [ CHUCKLES ] YOU KNOW, WORKPLACE ROMANCES AND STUFF LIKE THAT, AND IT'S GREAT WHEN THINGS ARE GOING REALLY GOOD WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP AND EVERYBODY AT WORK KNOWS ABOUT IT, BUT IT REALLY -- PARDON THE EXPRESSION -- SUCKS WHEN IT DOESN'T, BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS WHEN IT'S NOT GOING GOOD, TOO. ♪♪ GENE AND I -- WE HAD SIMILAR SCHEDULES. WE WORKED -- I DON'T KNOW -- PROBABLY 60%, 70% OF OUR WORK HOURS WE WORKED TOGETHER. HEY, DO YOU WANT A HAND? EVERY TWO MONTHS OR SO, WE'D HAVE TO REPLACE THE CHARTS. OH, DEAR.

GENE WOULD'VE FELT THAT THIS GUY HAD, YOU KNOW, NO SELF-ESTEEM, HAD NO FRIENDS, HAD NO, YOU KNOW, CLOSE FAMILY AROUND OR ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, ANYBODY TO REALLY BE THERE FOR HIM, TO GUIDE HIM. BUT GENE BEING ONE OF THE FEW ONLY ONES THAT WAS ACTUALLY NICE TO HIM, I'M SURE HE THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS HIS BEST CHANCE OF HAVING A FRIEND. I THINK HE WANTED TO BE LIKE GENE.

WE WERE BUILDING A NEW HOUSE. GENE WAS THEN GONNA NEED TO PREPARE HIS CURRENT HOUSE AND SELL THAT. WE WERE EXTREMELY BUSY. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] SWEETIE, CAN YOU GET IT? Gene: SORRY. [ CHUCKLES ] IT WAS ABOUT THE END OF SUMMER. GENE'S HOUSE WAS ALL READY TO BE PUT UP ON THE MARKET, AND IT WAS KNOWN AT WORK THAT GENE WAS SELLING HIS HOME AND OUR PLANS OF BUILDING ONE TOGETHER. OH.

FOR A SPLIT SECOND, IT SEEMED ODD. HOWEVER... YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS A GORGEOUS HOME. I GO, "ANYBODY WOULD BE BLESSED TO HAVE IT. I MEAN, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, YOU KNOW? WHY WOULD THAT BE ODD, BOB?" WOULD YOU SELL IT AS IS? THE FURNITURE... THE LINEN... YOU WANT TO BUY THE LINEN, TOO? IT JUST SEEMED LIKE SUCH AN ODD QUESTION. I COULDN'T POSSIBLY THINK HOW ANYBODY WOULD ASK THAT, OR, WHAT HE SERIOUS? I MEAN... BUT HE WAS. I WAS LIKE, OH, MY. YEAH. WELL, I'M SURE WE CAN COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ MAILBOX DOOR CREAKS ] Jim: GENE WAS VERY FAMILY-ORIENTED, AND HE HAD WANTED CHILDREN FROM THE BEGINNING, BUT HIS FIRST WIFE COULDN'T CONCEIVE WITH HER ILLNESS. I DID SOME RESEARCH ON, WHAT WOULD BE THE POSSIBILITY OF ME HAVING CHILDREN? I MEAN, I ALREADY HAD CHILDREN, BUT I JUST FELT LIKE THIS MAN, OH, HE IS SO INCREDIBLE. HE DESERVED TO HAVE CHILDREN. HOW AWESOME. AND WHAT AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER HE WOULD BE TO HELP RAISE CHILDREN. JAYE JAYE? TO DO THAT ON MY OWN -- IT WASN'T GONNA BE POSSIBLE, SO I FOUND OUT THAT WE COULD, IN FACT, HAVE AN EGG DONOR TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WE GOT WORD THAT THE EGG DONOR WAS SELECTED. THEY ALREADY STARTED THE PROCEDURES ON HER TO GET HER READY TO EXTRACT EGGS. [ BOTH LAUGH ] I LOVE YOU! [ LAUGHS ] WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT HAVING CHILDREN WITH THE TWO OF US COULD BE POSSIBLE, GENE WAS PINCHING HIMSELF.
