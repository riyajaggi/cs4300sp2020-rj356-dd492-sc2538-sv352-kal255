I DON'T THINK I WAS THINKING ABOUT KILLING HER RIGHT AWAY. I THINK THAT WAS MORE TOWARDS THE END. I DIDN'T SEE HIM SHOW ANY REMORSE IN THE CONFESSION TAPES. ALMOST SICK, SICK TO HEAR IT. I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS HAD HAPPENED TO ALISHA. [sobbing] I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT HOW MUCH SHE MUST'VE SUFFERED [sniffle] AND HOW SCARED SHE MUST'VE BEEN. [ SNIFFLE ] ♪♪ AFTER SHE DIED, UM... YOU TOOK OFF HER CLOTHES? [crying] AND THEN, AFTER HE KILLED HER, HE UNDRESSED HER [sniffle] AND, INSTEAD OF CALLING 911 TO SAVE THE BABY'S LIFE, HE RAPED MY DAUGHTER, AFTER SHE WAS ALREADY PASSED. [ SINISTER MUSIC CLIMBS ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ MELANCHOLY TUNE PLAYS ] Watts: ALISHA WAS THE TYPE OF FRIEND YOU COULD CONFIDE IN. IT'S HARD TO FIND FRIENDS LIKE THAT. ♪♪ SHE, UM, WAS ALWAYS LAUGHING AND SMILING, EVEN WHEN THINGS GOT TOUGH. AND I MISS THAT POSITIVE OUTLOOK. I FEEL LIKE I LOST A PART OF ME. IT'S JUST GONE. [crying] HE TOOK TWO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE FROM US AND WE'LL NEVER GET IT BACK. I JUST -- THERE'S NO WORDS FOR THE PAIN THAT YOU FEEL FROM LOSING SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE. ♪♪ WE CALLED IT THE PURPLE PROJECT AND WE HELP YOUNG, PREGNANT MOTHERS, LIKE ALISHA, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY WHO IS AMBITIOUS, WHO WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE, WHO IS A SINGLE PARENT. SO WE HELP THEM WITH THEIR APARTMENT, WITH THEIR MONEY, WITH FOOD. IF THEY ARE GOING TO COLLEGE, WE'LL HELP THEM PAY FOR THEIR COLLEGE. ♪♪ I WANT ALISHA TO BE REMEMBERED NOT BY HOW SHE DIED. I WANT HER TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE FUN-LOVING, COMPASSIONATE PERSON THAT SHE WAS, A PERSON WITH PURPOSE AND DRIVE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO CONTINUE AS, YOU KNOW, ALISHA'S LIFE AND LEGACY, AND JUST TO BE REMEMBERED AS A LOVING PERSON THAT SHE WAS. ♪♪ [ OUTRO PLAYS ]
