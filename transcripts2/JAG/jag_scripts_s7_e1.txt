  ♪ ♪  HAWKES:   I don't understand, Boss.  Commander Rabb should have been  within a quarter-mile of me.  Lieutenant, what was your   heading at ejection?  Um, roughly north  by northwest.  We were at 275 knots.  In this storm,   set-and-drift   are seven knots  and one-three-five degrees true,  Skipper.  That would put   Commander Rabb  anywhere in this area.  That's 1,800 square miles, sir.

 Tiner, give me ZNN  on number two  and the Navy and Marine Corps  News on number three.  Yes, sir.  Gunny, I need the charts  for the Western Atlantic.  I'm on it,   Lieutenant.  And the rolling bulletin board.  Aye, sir.  Mm, thank you.  Tables, chairs and linens  arrived at the hall  45 minutes ago.  They're unloading  the flowers as we speak.  Why don't we wait  and see what happens  before we postpone  the wedding, Sarah?  If they find him  in the next few hours...

 They'll take him to sick bay  and we'll be waiting for   a report on his condition.  I have to make  some phone calls.  I'll do it.  No, I'll do it.  You stay on top of it.  I'll warm your dinner.  The storm's easing  and the captain has resumed   the search in a Viking.  If they find  the commander  they got a Seahawk  standing by.  "If," sir? Ceiling's low,  visibility's poor, Lieutenant.  REPORTER:   ...24 hours.  Inland, rain...  (thunder crashing)  MAN:   We're not picking up  his emergency beacon, sir.  We'd have to pass within   50 meters to find him.  What about your radar,   Commander?  Closed out, sir.  Sea state's too high.  We're just picking up spray.  REPORTER:  We will, of course, have updates  on this storm  throughout its duration.  Turning to weather news   around the rest...  (loud bang)  Gunny, I'm trying to get  Harm's mother's phone number  off the computer  and the cursor froze.  Could you help me, please?  Are you planning on   calling her, Renee?  Yeah.  I think we should wait   until we have news.  We have news.  That's incomplete.  She has a right to know.   What his  condition is? We don't have   that information yet.  She might want to fly out, Bud.  How would that help   the commander?  ( screams )  Any luck yet?  Hey, um... close the door.  I've been ignoring you.   I'm sorry.  (thunder rumbling)  You okay?  No.  Well, Mac, it's Harm.  Isn't he, like,  invincible?  Chloe, it doesn't   look good.  What?  You don't talk like that.  I'm just being realistic.  I don't  understand you.  I thought you'd already  be trying to find him.  He's in the middle   of the ocean.  No, like you found me.  When I was thrown  by my horse in the woods.  MACKENZIE:  Okay, Chloe, I'll try.  I was thinking of you.  And I was  on a plane... I was dreaming...  I saw lightning   hitting a tree.  I-I can't   do this, Chloe.  Keep trying.  I need your help.  Well, the latest reports   have the Viking moving south.  Any particular   reason?  Not that I can tell.  Unless they're following  the currents south, but...  Look here. CHEGWIDDEN:   She has identified a position  on the ocean chart.  INGLES:   Uh, sir, with all due respect  I'm trying to get the best use   out of my search assets.  (sighs)  Hold on. Colonel, I know you've done this  once before, but...  If the skipper  has a better plan, sir...  Captain, the colonel has a   history of success with this.  Believe me,   if it was anyone else  hell, I'd be skeptical, too.  The coordinates, sir?  35 degrees, 15 minutes   north latitude.  73 degrees, 28 minutes   west longitude.  I'll put the suggestion   into the mix, Admiral.  Thank you, Captain.  His call.  Thanks for trying, sir.  Boss, where's the Viking?  AIR BOSS:   Here, sir.  Viking, this is the captain.  I've got some coordinates   for you.  LOFTNESS (over radio):   Aye, sir.  Going down below cloud deck.  I'm at 100 feet.  Visibility low.  Commencing search.  Nothing.  Got something!  Drop the SAR buoys.  INGLES:   Viking, what do you have?  Stand by, sir.  Viking, do you read?  Aye, sir.  It's an empty raft, sir,  and there's no one   in the water.  Come back!  Help!  We'll continue the search  but I don't think   I have to explain what a...  an abandoned raft indicates.  Well, thanks for sticking   with it, Skipper.  Aye, sir.  Colonel MacKenzie?  Yes, sir.  I don't know what it is   you have working  but it's one hell   of a gift.  It failed, Captain.  Blame it on timing?  That's one area of my life   I never question, sir.  Yes, well, uh, I'm sorry.  We'll keep you abreast.  Thank you, Captain.  (knocking)  Hey, I've been looking   for you.  We thought we  had Harm  but it was  only his raft.  Well, then   he must be close.  I'm going to lie  down, sir.  BRUMBY:  I have your dinner.  I'm not hungry.  Do you want  some tea?  Okay.  I don't know what to tell   you, Mic.  She's dealing with it   in her own way.  That's the problem, sir.  Hi.  Hi.  Where's your son?  He's at your feet.  Oh.  Hi.  Stealthy.  Listen, Bud feels badly   about what happened.  I'm okay.  Thanks.  Let's go, sweetie.  Look who's here. Mommy.  How are things in here?  No less depressing.  Is there anything  I can do for you, Mic?  I'm all right.  Why aren't you with Mac?  That's a question   you'd have to ask her.  Oh.  Have a seat, Mic.  You all right?  How do I look?  Left out.  Get used to it, Renee.  We're members of this family   by acquaintance only.  Mayday. Are you there?  Do you read me?  Help! Help!  Commander!  Help!  I've got something.  Do you read me?  What are you  doing out here?  Eating ziti.  Is it any good?  Microwave sucked   the life out of it.  I wish I knew how   to make it better for you.  That helped.  You kissed me.  See, it's easy.  All you have  to do is sit there.  I need you.  ROBERTS:  Colonel, the Admiral  needs to see you ASAP.  CHEGWIDDEN:  We have everyone?  Yes, sir.  I just got off the phone  with Captain Ingles.  It appears their S-Three  picked up   Commander Rabb's voice.  He was transmitting   over a SAR buoy.  What's that?  It's a search-   and-rescue buoy  with a radio  transmitter. Well, does that mean   they know where he is?  They can home in  on his signal.  The Viking and SAR helo   are on their way.  Any calculations   as to how long  he's been in the water?  Over three hours.  What's the survival time   under present conditions?  CHEGWIDDEN:  According to the skipper,  about that long.  But he is conscious, sir?  When he made that transmission,   Colonel, yes, he was.  He's no longer   transmitting, Angel. Viking, this is Angel.  We're not finding him.  The sea state is too great.  LOFTNESS:   Can you get lower?  I'm already below   the minimums, Viking,  but I'm taking her down.  (yelling)  Still no sign of him.  Initiating 1,000-meter circle.  I see muzzle flashes.  Someone's down there.   I'm turning back.  There he is.  AIR BOSS ( over radio ):  What are the conditions, Angel?  Estimate 20-foot swells.  Can you get him?  We're going to put   a swimmer in the water.  Take me down!  Swimmer's going down!  Bring us right!   Bring us right!  Bring us left! Hold her steady here!  Stand by, we're going up!  He's hooked!  PILOT:   Good. Haul his ass up.  Okay. Pulling them up!  They're clear.  Coming up.  Keep it steady.  Come on, sir, you're   almost in.  Keep coming.  Got it.  Give me some slack.  He's off the cable.   Let him down, easy.  We got him, Skipper.  Bravo Zulu to all hands.  Gangway!  Clear the corridor!  Wrap the thermal angel.  He's ice cold.  The man's severely hypothermic.  Get him out of these clothes.  Body temperature is   30 degrees Celsius.  Put him on  a heart cardiac monitor.  Get me two   18 gauge I.V.s. Get him some   warm blankets and a heated liter  of normal saline.  What's the rhythm?   It's junctional at 45. Throwing PVCs.  Give him one milligram  of atropine I.V.  Is the saline ready? Ready.  Go. Respiration's falling fast.  Commander... Commander!  Come on, stay with me.  I'm not getting through to him.  Through what can only be   described as the grace of God  Commander Rabb's been rescued.  However,  I've been told  that he is in the fourth stage   of hypothermia.  How bad is that, sir?  Serious.  Will he make it? RENEE:  He better.  We have Springsteen tickets. DOCTOR:  We got a diminishing pulse here. Commander! Come on!  Stay with me.  Respiration is falling fast.   We're out of options. HAWKES:   Can I try, doctor?  He knows me. Get him talking.  Harm...  Harm...  Harm...  Harm, it's cold down here   and I need you.  I can't do it  by myself.  Help me, Harm.  Come on.  You promised.  You promised  you'd be there  and I'm holding you to that.  Now, I don't  swim well.  Temperature's still dropping.  Commander, can you hear me?!  (monitor beeping)   He's bradycardic.  Take that thing off.  Take it off.  Save me.  (faintly):   I'm...  ...trying.  Pulse rate's up.  Don't let go.  Don't let go.  (faintly):   Hi.  Hi, yourself.  Keep talking to me.  I.. can't... breathe.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Have we dated?  (laughs)  Oxygen.  (whispering):  You're going to be okay.  (knocking)  Got your message.  Hi. I assumed   you'd call.  I didn't mean   for you to come   all the way up here. Come in. Well, you said  you needed to talk.  Sounded like something  we should do in person.  Um, it's about Harm. He's being   transferred today  from the carrier  to Bethesda.  I thought you   should be prepared.  I'm told he's   pretty beat up.  And you don't think   I can handle it?  What I mean is...  I have visited people   in the hospital before, Mac.  I just wouldn't let him   know what you're feeling.  You mean my love for him?  I mean you should   be careful  of indicating distress   at his physical condition.  Okay.  He'll be there around 11:00.  Then so will I.  The rest of us won't get there   until this afternoon.  I've got a FNAEB,   Bud's at BUPERS  and the Admiral   is working with the   SECNAV on the PRECEPT.  I have no idea  what you're talking about  but I'm sure all of you  could've found a way  of visiting Harm  this morning  and you're giving me   the first opportunity.  I appreciate that.  Good morning.  Morning.  Hey.  (raspy):  Hi.  (chuckles)  Wow.  How long's it been...  since we worked  together?  You mean on that   recruiting commercial?  Yeah. What, about a year?  Yeah, about that.  Well, what a surprise.  I appreciate you coming out.  You didn't think  I'd bother?  No. I mean,  I'm glad you did.  I called your mother.  She is taking   an evening flight.  She'll be here   sometime tomorrow.  You know my mother?  DOCTOR:   The CAT scan revealed  minor swelling on the  Commander's right frontal lobe.  As a result, he's suffering  from a pre-incident   neurological deficit.  CHEGWIDDEN:   Translate, please?  It's retrograde amnesia.  It's a loss of memory   prior to the trauma.  Is that normal?  In 30% of the cases, yes.  Will he know us? That's hard to predict,  Lieutenant.  He seems to be able  to recall the distant past.  And the recent past?  I'd say is shaky.  We think  it's temporary  but we'll know for sure  when the swelling subsides.  Doctor.  I'm sorry. I have to  continue with my rounds.  If you have  any questions  the nurse can reach me.   His room's right there.  Good luck.  Thanks, Doctor.  I hope he won't remember   the time I hid  on top of the JAG elevator.  I was so immature then.  It's nice  to see you, Admiral.  Same here, Commander.  Bud, sir.  You think   I don't remember you, Bud?  I was looking   at the lieutenant's bars.  Congratulations.  Thank you, sir.  Hi, Harriet.  How are the kids?  How are you, sir?  Well, apparently  very involved  with this woman  (chuckles)  so I'm told.  Uh, Brumby, of course  I could never forget you.  I'll take that as a compliment.  Mac...  I'm sorry I missed the wedding.  You didn't.  Really?  Now I'm really sorry.  Have you set another date?  Don't worry about it.  It's the least of our concerns.  I'm told that you were   very instrumental  in helping find me.  Not really.  Really. She led them  to the raft.  You weren't far off. Hi. I'm going to have  to ask you   to give us 20 minutes.  Okay.  We'll be back.  I look forward to it, sir.  Okay.  Mac...  Thank you.  So, about the new date?  Mic, I really haven't   thought about it.  Well, I have.  The hall's  available Saturday  and everything's  still there.  Can we get it together   that fast?  We canceled it  that fast.  Shouldn't be hard.  Yeah, but it's   in three days.  So you want to wait.  Um, Chloe's going   back home today...  Call her grandmother.  Ask her to stay  through the weekend.  I don't know if I can get   my head into it, Mic.  Let me think about it.  CHLOE:   Did you get my bear claw?  Is he, like, the best guy ever?  May I join you?  Sure.  Where is everyone?  Here and there.  Harriet's with   the Admiral.  He's giving her   a recipe for   lemon risotto.  You guys are all  so... chummy.  Listen, Renee,  about what happened   at JAG...  Oh, I'm over it, Bud.  Okay. How are you?  Well, my boyfriend's forgotten  our last year together,  but he seems to have  all of his Mac memories  organized and catalogued.  Renee, that's just   physiological.  He'll come out of this  and you two will  be back together and right where   you left off.  You make that sound  like a good thing.  MACKENZIE:   I'm sorry.  CHLOE:  Don't be.  It's an excuse to come back.  Besides, Mic has already  promised to take me  to an Ethiopian restaurant.  Well, okay.  Anyway, I'm going home   with the coolest story.  I'll call you   when we reschedule.  Okay.  I love you.  I love you, too.  (both laugh)  See you, tiger.  Bye.  (both chuckle)  You guys are so good together.  WOMAN (over P.A.):   Flight 427  to Lake Champlain,   gate four...  How'd you turn her   around so fast?  Surprise you?  No. Why would   you say that?  I don't think   this weekend's   going to work out.  Yeah, no worries.  We can do it  next month.  Why don't we shelve it  for awhile?  What do you mean?  Let's postpone it  indefinitely.  Mic, that's not funny.  You're right,  it's not.  I don't want  to reschedule, Sarah.  Then what do   you want to do?  Let me think about it.  Commander!  Hey, wow,   you're looking good, Skates.  Back at you, sir.  Commander Loftness.  Rabb.  Well, Commander,   I understand that  you personally violated  every safety minimum in the book while you were searching for us. Love flying  in zero-zero.  Well, we owe you our lives.  Turns out the aircraft   we gave you  had a hard-deck landing.  Subsequent inspection  uncovered no damage.  Looks like she  was hiding her  secrets from us.  You ever want to come  back for a visit  I'll find you a Tomcat   that works.  How about today?  I'm checking out of here   in two hours.  We're in port.  Damn.  Good luck.  That's it?  Yep.  So, I understand you jumped   my bones in sick bay.  Rumor.  Oh, yeah?  Well, that was a hell   of a ride we took, huh? At least you went  out with a bang.  I'm returning  to the fleet, Harm.  What happened to   the idea of shore duty? The experience actually  reawakened my love  for shipboard flying.  Made me realize the danger  is one of the reasons I do it.  Really? What's your fiancé   have to say about this? He supports me.  I guess that why   he's my fiancé.  What about you?  Well, I'm almost back to normal. Hmm, think so?  Well, I certainly   have recovered--  or at least to the satisfaction   of the doctors.  Life doesn't feel  any different to you?  What do you mean? Well, you've been  given a chance  to take another  look at things--  to grab hold of what's  really important to you.  You don't think I haven't  already done that?  I hadn't.  Excuse me, Colonel.  I'm sorry for  the boldness of  this question  but I've been fielding   half-a-dozen calls  about your wedding.  You set a new date yet?  Um, close the door.  Um, Mic and I   are having problems.  During the crisis  with Harm  I hurt his feelings. Does he understand  what you're going through?  On one level,   and on another, he doesn't.  Are you talking?  Not as much as I'd like  but we seem   to be making progress.  So I tell people what?  That, um, we're working out   the logistics.  Yes, ma'am.  Don't worry about us, Harriet.  We'll get past this.  We have to.  Oh, you all right? Yeah, I'm fine,  I'm fine.  You okay?  Yep.  Just kept telling myself  better your suitcase  than your casket.  You want something?  Tea, a sandwich?  No, no, I'm good.  How about some music? No, thanks,  I'm fine.  Just relax. Harm.  When you couldn't remember   our relationship  were you wondering   if I could ever be  someone that you could be with?  Renee...  I know.  God, I know.  I hate myself  when I talk like this.  Then why are   you doing it? Because I'm afraid.  I'm afraid not to.  Is this about Mac again?  Why do we always   got to come back to this?  You're right.  You're right.  You need to rest.  You do.  So, look, um...  I'm going to call you  later, okay?  Renee, I'm not mad.  I just...  I know.  I don't want to talk about this   right now.  It's okay. It is.  It's okay.  (door closes)  (sighs)  (heavy sigh)  Mic?  In here.  Hey, what are  you doing?  Where's your stuff?  In storage.  I sublet a place uptown. Why?  I need space   to think, Sarah and I can't do it here. I don't understand.  Why are you moving out?  Because if we end it,  I don't want to have  to come back here  after the fact.  Why would we end it?  Stop walking away from me!  We never talked about  you moving out.  You can't just make  some unilateral decision   without me, okay?  We're a couple, right?  And couples make decisions   together.  That's what they do!  Who made the decision   to cancel the wedding? We did.  You did, with my blessing. Who made the decision not to reschedule for   the following weekend? I wasn't ready.  And I wasn't   allowed a vote. You're right.   I'm sorry.  Don't be sorry. Be honest. Why are you   marrying me, Sarah? Because I love you.  Then why, in a crisis am I always the last  one you look to?  I don't know.  You need to find out,  and when you do  we can have   a conversation that will make sense  to both of us.  Please don't leave.  Let me tell you why  you're pleading with me to stay. Not because I'm going  to break your heart  and not because you love me  too much to let me go.  It's 'cause you  don't want to be alone.  It's not a good enough reason.  (door closes)  (sighs)  (knocking)  Hi. Welcome back.  Wow. You look miserable.  Come on in.  Maybe not.  Mac, come on in.  He moved out. He did? Why?  I don't think   he believes I love him.  Do you?  Yes.  Well, tell him.  It's complicated.  Talk to me.  This is a mistake.  I don't know why I'm here.  (phone ringing)  Hang on.   Hang on, all right?  Hello.  Just-just a minute.  It's for you.  Hello.  I was sitting here wondering   who you'd go to first.  Mic.  I have my answer.  Mic, give me your address.  I'll be right there.  No, I'm leaving.  Closed up the office.  Catching the first plane   back to Australia.  What, you need to be  on the other side of the world   to think?  I'm done thinking.  'Bye, beautiful.  Mic.  (dial tone)  He's leaving the country. Why?  I got to stop him.  Is it because  you came here?  (door opens)  He just can't get past   this thing with us.  Maybe that's because   we can't get past it.  (door closes)  (phone ringing)  Hello.  What?  But...  When did he go?  Mic!  (phone ringing)  Hello.  (crying):   He's gone.  He wouldn't even speak to me.  Hey, hey.  Don't blame yourself for this.  Brumby has always   acted impulsively.  It was just a matter of time.  What are you saying?  Look, this isn't going   to make it hurt any less,  but it's better now than   six months into the marriage.  Okay, I'm hanging up now.  Mac.  Where are you going?  I don't know.  Come to me.  Why?  So we can talk.  (sighs)  We already talked.  Don't argue with me.  I need a better reason.  You know the reason.  Mac.  I'm here.  I'm waiting.  (sighs)  (sobbing)  (quietly):  Mac, Renee's father died.  Suddenly--  heart failure.  She just got here.  We can't do this now.  I told her  I'd fly back with her.  I should be gone  a couple of days.  I'm sorry.  No, you have to go.  I'll call you when we land.  Don't do that to her.  She needs you.  Give her your   full attention. What about you?  I'll be okay...  when you get back.  (Renee moaning)  (thunder rumbling)  ♪ ♪
