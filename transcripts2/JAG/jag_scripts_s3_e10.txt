  Did you bring the money? $20,000, like we agreed.  You bring the documents?  The money, please.  Trust, but verify, yes?  Garbage One to Control.  Subject has entered warehouse  at Fulton and 12th.  (over radio):  Control to Garbage One. Proceed. 10-4, Control.  We're going in.  These the originals?

 Of course.  Photocopies would do you no good  as evidence.  Do you read Russian?  No.  No matter;  you can get it translated.  RUSSIAN: The money,  please, Commander Rabb.  First, I get it   translated,  then you get the money.  This is not acceptable.  But reasonable, Tovarish.  You made  my heart stop, Mischa.  Unfortunately,   it started up again.  What the hell's  going on here?  Who's he?

 I went to great risk and expense to get this material, Colonel.  That's why   I'm here.  Please.  I don't think so.  I have no order to kill you   today, Commander Rabb,  only to retrieve  the dossier.  (cans rattling)  (gunshot)  FBI, don't move!  Drop the weapon.  Now.  Following in   his father's footsteps  as a naval aviator,  Lieutenant Commander   Harmon Rabb, Jr.,  suffered a crash   while landing his Tomcat  on a storm-tossed carrier   at sea.  Diagnosed with night blindness  Harm transferred to the Navy's   Judge Advocate General Corps  which investigates, defends  and prosecutes   the law of the sea.  There, with fellow JAG lawyer   Major Sarah MacKenzie,  he now fights in and out   of the courtroom  with the same daring   and tenacity  that made him a top gun   in the air.  AGENT: This whole thing smells   like yesterday's fish.  You're a JAG officer,  but you're not working  for JAG?  Not tonight. You go to a deserted warehouse in the middle of the night   for a meeting.  Why, if you're not on the job?  RABB: It was  personal business.  With a Russian criminal? You know, guys, I really  didn't check his background.  Stepan Gregorovitch Konaplanik,  Russian mafia,  thief, smuggler, killer.  He's on  the FBI Alert list.  We've been   tracking him since he entered the   country a week ago. You know   who he contacted?  You.  These documents,  they mention your name.  That's not my name.  That's my father.  1969, my father  was shot down  over Vietnam.  I found out he was shipped  to the Soviet Union   as a P.O.W.  What's this got to do  with Konaplanik?  Konaplanik contacted me   three weeks ago.  Said he had proof  my father was still alive.  And he offered to sell  you this proof?  That's right.  We set up a meeting.  We were about   to make the exchange  and the other guy showed up.  Right, right.  The other guy.  Mischa.  I don't like one of my officers  being treated like a criminal.  Then he should stop acting  like one and cooperate. He is cooperating.  Why is he involved   with the Russian mafia?  You know what I think happened?  You made a deal, like you said.  You showed up with the money;   he asked for more...  And you whacked him.  There was another guy there.  He was the shooter.  So he shoots Konaplanik?  He puts the gun  in your hand  and then he disappears?  That's right,  except he didn't put the gun   in my hand!  There was no one else there.  You had the money,   you had the documents,  you had the gun. No one went   out the front.  All the other doors and windows   were stuck shut.  There was no one else.  If Rabb says there was,  then there was.  I assume you checked  the weapon for prints.  The weapon has a   checkered, rubber grip no prints.  The gunfire   residue test shows  your man fired   a handgun.  They pulled this   out of Konaplanik.  It's a hundred-grain,   truncated hollow-point.  Israeli-made.  Recognize it?  I use a 115-grain   full metal jacket. Sorry.  Come on, Commander.  The vic's a killer. Scum.  Nobody's going to miss him.  Hell, you'll  probably get a medal for   shooting him.  Admit you did it and we can   all go home. (chuckling)  I say something funny?  Yeah. The technique   you're using--  I used it on a suspect   last week.  Did he confess?  Uh-uh.  Turns out he was innocent.  Lieutenant, what I'm about  to tell you is confidential. Yes, sir. My loose lips  will sink no ships.  Commander Rabb is involved in   an FBI murder investigation.  Who was murdered, sir?  Um, Russian mafioso  or mafia-nik, or whatever   the hell they're called.  Any suspects, sir?  Yeah. Commander Rabb. I'm-I'm sorry, sir.  I thought   you said Commander Rabb.  The FBI   is interrogating him now.  I want him out.  Yes, sir.  (sighs)  How, sir?  Lieutenant,   shake the cobwebs loose.  Find me Clayton Webb.  Sir, it's 0245.  I...  Aye, sir.  Yes, sir. Right away.  AGENT:   Gentlemen...  there's been   a development.  I'm Clayton Webb.  I'm taking custody   of Commander Rabb.  Like hell you are.  This is an   FBI case.  Not anymore.  It comes from   the Deputy Director.  Who are you with,  Webb, the Agency?  State Department.  Yeah, and I'm  a Peace Corps volunteer.  Gentlemen, it's been a blast.  I'll see you again.  Well, I'll look forward to that. (documents rustle)  Why don't you cut  the "State Department" crap?  Webb, everybody knows  you're CIA.  Stepan Konaplanik   was a stone killer.  Whoever took him out   must've been very good.  Thanks, but it wasn't me.  It wasn't me.  Tell me   about this other player--  the Colonel.  Six-foot-one, -two; 50s.  Konaplanik knew him.  He called him "Mischa."  "Mischa"?  That's short for Mikhail.  Colonel Mikhail somebody.  I want you to look   at some pictures.  So you believe me?  Of course.  I'll call you in the morning.  Clay.  The dossier  has information about my father. I need it.  I got you out, Rabb.  Don't push your luck.  Uh, good morning, sir.  The Admiral  wants to see you.  I'm on my way.  Uh...  Something else,   Lieutenant?  No, sir.  Just...  welcome back.  Where have I been?  I-I can't really say  but I'm really glad  you're not there anymore, sir.  Sir? I just wanted  you to know  that if you need anything,  you can count on me.  I'll keep that in mind, Bud.  I have a meeting  at the Pentagon.  Walk with me.  You were buying stolen documents from a Russian thug.  Just what in the hell  were you thinking?  Sir, that dossier  confirms  North Vietnam sent American  P.O.W.s to the Soviet Union. Even if that was the case,  wh-what was that,  30 years ago?  Harm, I know  you want to believe  that your father's  still alive,  but what are the odds?  I don't know, sir, but if my father is alive,   others might be, too.  Maybe they'd like   to come home.  Sir, I need   that dossier.  It's not going  to do you any good  if you're in prison  for murder.  Admiral, I have   some leave coming... Negative, Commander.  No leave.  Sir...  However...  until this matter  is cleared up,  you're temporarily relieved  of your duties.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Admiral,   I didn't kill Konaplanik.  Rabb, I already lost   one good lawyer  when Major McKenzie resigned.  I don't want to lose another.  Commander Rabb,  come on in.  Novack, what the   hell are you doing?  Conducting a lawful search.  You got a warrant? "Phone records, computer disks,  firearms, ammunition... "  We're helping   local law enforcement investigate  a homicide.  Marvin?  Yeah.  In here.  What's up?  Israeli-made ammo.  What do you want to bet   it's nine-millimeter,  hundred-grain,  truncated hollow-points.  It's not mine.  You have the right  to remain silent.  If you give up that right  to remain silent...  NAVY SECRETARY:   You're off course here,   Admiral.  If they want to try Rabb   in a civilian court, let them.  He's a naval officer,   Mr. Secretary.  He's subject  to a military court-martial.  Why, you want to convict one   of your own people of murder?  If he's guilty.  And exonerate him if he's not.  Admiral,   let me clarify the situation.  Our relationship with Russia is  currently in a state of, uh...  optimistic convalescence.  I understand that.  Good.  Now, a naval officer buying   secrets stolen from Moscow  is not the act of an ally.  Secrets about American POWs  who ended up   in a Soviet prison camp?  We've confronted them   on this before.  We'll confront them again.  But we don't want to give   the impression  that we are sanctioning  covert operations   against Russia.  It seems to me, Mr. Secretary,  that a military court could put   the proper spin on this case  better than a civilian one.  Well, that, uh, that spin being? That Rabb  acted on his own   with no military involvement.  Can you assure me   that this will come out  in the preliminary hearing?  It will in an Article 32   hearing, yes, sir.  I'll talk   to the Attorney General.  What?  You don't remember me,   do you, sir?  Staff Sergeant...?  Teddy Ramirez.  Four years ago,   Parris Island.  I was a Lance Corporal then.  Dereliction of duty.  Right!  You got me off.  You used the ignorance defense.  Sure.  How are you, Teddy?  All right, sir.  Look, I'm sorry about this.  I'll pass the word   to the other guards  you're okay. If you need anything, sir,   you just let me know.  Well, what I need, Teddy,   is to get out of here.  What are you doing?  Oh, no. It's not  what you think.  You got visitors.  Thank you,  Staff Sergeant.  Hello, Harm.  You look surprised.  I, uh... Carolyn Imes.  I thought you were   on assignment in Spain.  I was, and enjoying it.  I figured   I'd get Mattoni.  You did get Mattoni.  He's prosecuting.  But murder cases  are my specialty, remember?  That's why the Admiral  called me back.  Any objections?  No. No.  I'll be   assisting, sir.  Of course you will, Bud.  Well, let's get started.  RABB:   I heard a noise. It was probably one   of the FBI Agents  tripping   over his shoelace.  I grabbed  for the Colonel's weapon.  He fired, and he took off.  Before I could do anything,   the FBI were on me.  And the Colonel disappeared   without a trace,  leaving the dossier behind.  He probably forgot it   in all the confusion.  After flying 5,000 miles   for it?  RABB:  Have you talked  to the FBI, yet,  about getting   a copy of the dossier?  It's not going to happen.  It's classified.  That's ridiculous.   If they're going to use it  as evidence, Carolyn,   we have a right to it.  They're not. Apparently, Mattoni feels   the eyewitnesses are enough  not to mention   the ammunition in your toilet.  Yeah, well, I always keep  my ammunition in the toilet.  It was planted there  obviously.  Well, that's going   to be difficult to prove.  Carolyn, I need  to get out of here.  I can probably get you   involuntary manslaughter.  No.  No, no, no, no.  No plea bargaining.  I didn't think so.  We'll go   with self-defense, then--  justifiable  homicide.  You're basing your strategy  on the theory that I killed him. I'm basing my strategy  on what will keep you   out of Leavenworth.  You think I killed him?  What I think is irrelevant.  Not to me, it isn't!  If Harm said   he didn't do it, he didn't do it. IMES: How well  do you know him?  Well, we worked together--  sometimes on the same side,   sometimes as adversaries.  Are you close?  That depends   on what you mean by "close."  (knocking at door)  Sarah... Oh, excuse me.  Um, I need those  Palomar interrogatories.  Uh, yeah, I'll get to them   as soon as I finish  the requests for production   you asked for.  All right, thanks.   Uh, sorry to interrupt.  Dalton Lowne, Lieutenant  Commander Carolyn Imes. You're not here to steal  Major MacKenzie back, are you?  No, but, um, if you have   any other openings...  All right, we'll talk.  Um, nice to meet you.  I'll be in court  the rest of the day, so...  Fine. Yeah,   I'll be here, writing.  Which is what I've been doing   for four weeks.  Do you think Harm   is capable of murder?  Under the right circumstances,  we're all capable   of murder.  Really?  You know, Harm has   always been troubled  by his father's disappearance,  but, lately,   he seems consumed by it.  Ever since we had   that murder investigation  on the Hornet.  During the investigation,   Harm discovered a book  hidden in one   of the staterooms.  It listed the names   of American airmen  shot down over Vietnam.  He found his father's name.  According to the book,  he was shipped   to the Soviet Union.  What happened to the book?  It was stolen back  by a Russian agent impersonating a detective.  This the man  who stole the book?  No. Who is he?  The man Harm shot.  Allegedly shot.  Harm never forgave himself  for letting that book slip away, which is why   he's so consumed by it.  Which goes to motive.  I was thinking  of using you  as a character witness.  Yeah, I'd be happy to.  After what you just told me,  lady, I don't want you anywhere   near that witness stand.  MATTONI:   And then what did you   and your partner do?  NOVACK:   We followed Konaplanik   into the warehouse.  What happened then?  We heard  a firearm discharge.  We approached and   found the defendant, pistol in hand,  running away from  the deceased.  Is this the pistol?  NOVACK:   Yes, sir.  MATTONI:  Did you perform  a ballistics test on it?  Yes, sir. It proved this  was the murder weapon.  Did you see  or hear anyone else  in the vicinity?  We did not.  IMES:   Agent Grenin,  did you search Commander Rabb   when you apprehended him?  We did.  And what did you find,  besides the gun   and the dossier?  (whispering):  She's opening a can of worms.  ...an envelope,   containing $20,000.  Now, doesn't that   indicate to you  that Commander Rabb  was there to buy, not to kill?  Objection. Speculation.  IMES:  Goes to premeditation.  As this is only a hearing,   I'll allow it.  Go ahead, please.  It could be   that he was there to buy.  Thank you.  $20,000.  A lot of money.  That information  must be pretty valuable  to Commander Rabb.  Objection.   Leading the witness. JUDGE:   Overruled.  And in the future, let your   attorney do the objecting,  Commander. Proceed. I'd say that information   was very valuable to him.  Maybe even valuable enough   to kill for?  Maybe.  MATTONI:  Thank you, Agent Grenin.  No further questions.  RABB:  That's him.  It's the Colonel.  Colonel Mikhail Parlovsky.  Formerly with KGB,   First Chief Directorate. Now with external   intelligence.  One of the few who made it   through Yeltsin's purge.  A master spook.  Parlovsky's a patriot   without political ambitions,  which makes him dangerous.  To us or them?  To anyone   who threatens Mother Russia.  I'd love to get  him in a room  for a couple  of days.  So would I,  if I could find him.  You won't have to.  Once we put out word  you have the dossier, he'll find you.  But I don't have the dossier.  You want to clear  your name. He wants these documents. Mutual need--  the basis   for a beautiful friendship.  Well, what do you expect,  for him to break   into the brig?  No.  I expect you to break out.  Here.  And for God's sake,   don't shoot anybody.  I'm not going to do it.  I won't give these up.  You can have it back   after we catch him.  All right.  No tails...  no wires.  Agreed.  Call this number   once he makes contact. Guard!  Good night, Commander.  Is that real, sir?  Afraid so.  Let's go, Teddy. I'm going to need  the uniform.  I understand, Commander.  You got to do  what you got to do.  I just hope  they don't charge me  with dereliction  of duty again.  Well, if they do,   I'll defend you.  If you're still alive, sir.  CHEGWIDDEN:   What in the hell   was Rabb thinking?!  An armed escape,   for God's sake!  Bud, where'd   he get the gun?  I don't know, sir.  The last person to contact him  was Clayton Webb, sir.  I might have known.  Get me Clayton Webb at State.  Yes, sir.  I take it, uh, neither   of you has heard from him.  BOTH:  No, sir!  But if we do,   we will...  If you do, you tell him   to run, don't walk  to the nearest brig, police station   fire station, uh... Boy Scout troop--   I don't care.  If he doesn't   turn himself in, I will personally   see to it  that he spends the   rest of his life  making big rocks  into small ones. You tell him that.  BOTH:  Yes, sir.  (knocking at door)  You never call.   You never write.  If you let me in,  you'll be harboring a fugitive.  Did you do it?  No.  How's your Russian?  Ni plochah.  (sighing)  (moaning)  (sighing)  All right.  Oh...  Oh, that feels good. Yeah? How about  right there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?   Don't stop.  (phone rings)  MacKENZIE (on machine):   Hi. Leave a message.  I'll get back to you   as soon as possible.  Major,   this is Admiral Chegwidden.  Pick up if you're there, please. Call me ASAP,  especially if you hear   from Commander Rabb.  That is an order, Major.  (sighing)  (electronic voice):   Message Deleted.  (sighing)  You ignoring  a direct order?  I'm not in the Corps anymore,   remember?  I don't have to obey orders.  All right, now, as   near as I can tell,  your father arrived in  Prague in April 1970. From there,   he was sent to Moscow.  Now, according   to these manifests,  he then went by   trans-Siberian railroad  to a place called Cherlisk,   near Lake Boshna.  Cherlisk.  Okay.  What then?  The trail ends.  I'm sorry.  Where are you going?  I'm going to find   Mikhail Parlovsky.  Yeah, but you said he'd   only confess to the murder  if you turn   these papers over to him.  I'm not looking for him   for a confession.  I need him to find my father.  (sighing)  Rabb!  GRENIN:   Hold it   right there! (tires squealing)  (door opening)  Sarah...  are you all right?  What? Yeah,   I'm fine. Why?  I called you last night.  Didn't you get my message?  Uh, I'm sorry, Dalton.   I had a migraine.  Oh. Oh, you should've  called me.  I would've come over  and taken care of you.  That's sweet.   Um... next time. All right.  Uh, Coburn's here  for his deposition.  I've been covering  for you.  Coburn... Coburn v. Pitman,   the product liability suit?  Uh... yeah, right.   I'm sorry, Dalton.  Let me... grab my files. I'll be right there. All right.  Don't take too long.  Don't be alarmed,   Major MacKenzie.  (speaking Russian)  You know who I am.  Colonel Mikhail Parlovsky.  It's such a pleasure dealing  with intelligent people...  and do you know  why I'm here?  I don't have the documents.  Of course not.  Commander Rabb has them. If you think that,   then why are you here?  I lost the Commander  after he left your building.  He's, uh, quite a...  an enthusiastic young man,  your Harmon Rabb.  Those papers   are very important to him.  No doubt.  Here's my offer:  Rabb returns  the dossier to me...  all copies are destroyed...  and I will swear,  I killed Konaplanik.  And you won't get prosecuted because you have   diplomatic immunity.  Exactly.  I will simply   leave the country.  Did you... kill Konaplanik?  (chuckling)  I neither confirm... nor deny.  What if Rabb doesn't turn  over the documents to you? Oh. Then he will be dead   within a week.  Sar--  Excuse me.  Uh, we're waiting.  PARLOVSKY:  I'm going.  Thank you  for listening to me. With your   permission,  I will call you   this afternoon.  Good day, sir.  Uh, I'm sorry, Dalton.  Uh...  Uh...  What case was that?  Bud.  Oh, geez, sir,  don't you believe in footsteps?  What are you doing here? Major MacKenzie sent me.  This is, uh, some boat.  What is it,   like, a, uh... a ferry?  Used to be.  It hasn't been   in operation for years.  Sent you for what?  Parlovsky contacted her.  Well, it didn't take him long.  He wants to meet you, sir.  Okay.  Good.  Anything else?  Yeah. I got you a bag  with some food, clothes,  cell phone and some cigars.  Thanks, Bud.  You bet.  What do you want me to do, sir?  Go home.  Forget you saw me.  No. Seriously,   what can I do to help?  I'm being serious, Bud.  If Admiral Chegwidden   found out you were here, you'd be shoveling   snow in Yakutsk  for three years. Go on.  Wait, wait!  Don't-don't do this!  What?  A guy believes   in you, trusts you  offers you help,   and you diss him?  You can't do that.  Take it easy, Bud.  I'm your friend,   and right now you can use  all the friends   that you can get,  so don't tell me   to "take it easy, Bud"... sir.  Bud, it's because   you're my friend  that I don't want you to be   involved in this.  Sir, I've already   aided and abetted.  I don't know how much more   involved I can get.  All right.  (sighing)  You know the aviation museum   in Alexandria?  Stearman made  beautiful machines.  I know. I own one.  It belonged   to my father.  You fly?  In my youth. A little.  It's nice to see you  again, Commander.  Well, it's nice to see   you again, too, Colonel. So, you have   something of mine?  Why are these documents  so important   to you, Colonel? They're an embarrassment.  Russia must regain  its rightful status  as a world power.  To do so, we must  present a government  free of dishonesty  and free of corruption.  We must clean up  our act, as you say.  Releasing   American POWs  would be a good   place to start.  We have  no American POWs.  Colonel, the documents   say different.  Which is why   I must have them back.  Say I give you   these documents.  What's the quid pro quo? I clear you  of the murder charge.  And help me   find my father.  Impossible.  Think of the goodwill,   Colonel.  POWs taken by former  regime sent home.  Hell, you might  even get  into the World Trade  Organization.  If I agree to help you,  there's no guarantee  we will find him.  I'm willing   to take that chance.  Gentlemen. Hold it  right there, please.  Webb, what the hell   are you doing here?  Colonel Mikhail Parlovsky,   I'm Clayton Webb, CIA.  I know who you are, Mr. Webb.  WEBB:   Please keep   your hands  where I can  see them, Colonel.  Take it easy, Rabb.  You're still a fugitive,   remember?  I said no wires. Get in the van!  Yeah!  No!  You might hit Rabb.  (panting)  The Israeli ammo  in the toilet  was a nice touch,  Colonel.  You shouldn't   leave your key  in such an   obvious place.  Excellent safe house.  (sighing)  (dry chuckle)  (speaking Russian)  Podlyetz!  If he was not dead,   I would have killed him again.  What are you talking about?  These are fake.  You're lying.  No, no, no.  You were buying   worthless fiction.  No!  Stay where you are.  (cocks gun) This is a counterfeit,   Commander.  All made up. There's no such a place   as Cherlisk or Lake Boshna.  You were duped, Commander.  So was I.  Konaplanik made all this up,  and to think   I regretted killing him.  You said you'd help me.  Bury the dead, Commander.  That's my   help to you. I'm going home.  Colonel...  are you telling me the truth?  I'm sorry.  I truly am.  CHEGWIDDEN:   And where is Parlovsky now?  On his way back to Russia, sir,  as far as I know.  And the dossier? It never existed, sir.  It's over.  (sighing)  Not quite.  Yeoman.   Yes, sir. As Lieutenant Roberts  is no doubt hovering outside  my door, would you please ask   him to come in?  Aye, aye, sir. Admiral?  Lieutenant.  Would you kindly escort   Commander Rabb  back to the bench?  Good news.  JAG will defer charges  for the brig break  pending the outcome  of the court-martial.  Good. Listen,   Carolyn...  No, you listen.  I'm going for  justifiable homicide.  It's our only chance.  Carolyn...  You're gambling  with your life here, Harm.  I won't have any part of it.  It's justifiable homicide  or get yourself  a new lawyer.  I already have.  You're entitled  to civilian counsel,  but I think you're making  a big mistake.  Thank you for everything.  Good luck, then...  both of you.   Thanks.  Let's get to work.  Mr. Sahaj, you performed   a gunshot residue analysis  on Commander Rabb, correct?  Oh, yes.  What was the result?  We found traces   of barium  and antimony on his hand.  Indicating?  Commander Rabb fired a handgun.  Mr. Sahaj, when a person  fires a handgun, what happens?  Material comes out of   the bell like a cloud  and wraps itself  back around the shooter's hand.  Could this cloud  settle anywhere else?  Oh, yes.  On the target, uh... people in the   line of fire...  people near   the shooter...  the gun itself...  How about a person  who picks up the gun  immediately  after it's fired?  Yes. We'd find   residue on his palm  and on his web. So, if the shooter   were to aim the gun...  and I attempted   to stop him...  Sir, is this  exhibition necessary?  I don't know, but it is interesting.  Continue, Ms. MacKenzie. When the gun fires,  the residue cloud   would float back  and cover my hand.  Then if I were to wrestle   the gun from him,  I'd get residue   on my palm as well,  wouldn't I?  Thank you,   Lieutenant.  SAHAJ:   Yes, you   probably would.  So your reside analysis   does not prove conclusively  that Commander Rabb   fired the gun, does it?  He might   have been grabbing for it  when someone else fired it.  Objection.  Calls for  a conclusion.  JUDGE:   The man is an FBI   firearms expert.  We want to hear   his conclusions. JUDGE:  Please answer  the question.  Yes, it's possible.  In fact, your analysis  might prove Commander Rabb  was trying to prevent  the shooting.  I-I suppose so.  MacKENZIE:   Thank you,   Mr. Sahaj.  Special Agent Novack...  have you ever seen  this piece  of cloth before?  Oh, no, ma'am.  I can't say that I have. Would you be surprised  to learn  that I found it  at the murder scene  in a trapdoor leading  to the roof of the warehouse?  Nothing surprises me.  You surprised to learn  that there even was a trapdoor  leading to the roof?  I didn't see one.  Because you didn't look for one. Objection. Where is this going?  Sir, the hair  and fiber report  of this cloth sample  indicates   the material is karakul lamb,  grown primarily in Central Asia. So?  So, it goes to reasonable doubt. Someone else  was at the scene.  Someone who   wore a coat  manufactured   in Russia,  and that   person escaped through the trapdoor,  onto the roof.  This is ludicrous.   You could have found  that piece of rag on the street   for all we know.  But I didn't.  I found it at the scene   yesterday.  And if the FBI had done  a thorough  investigation,  they would have  found it first.  Mikhail Parlovsky   is one of Russia's  top intelligence operatives.  Was he involved  in the murder?  If you call pulling   the trigger involved.  According to your files  on Colonel Parlovsky,  what is his weapon  of choice?  The nine-millimeter   SIG Sauer.  Like this one?  Like that one.  Put me on the stand.  No.  Mac, "reasonable doubt"  isn't going to cut it.  Well, I think   it will.  Mac, put me on the stand.  No.  I can handle  Mattoni.  Not a day goes by  you don't think   about your father.  You'd do anything   to find him  and God help the person   who gets in your way.  You're obsessed! You're a time bomb!  All right, okay.  I get the idea.  Will we trust me  with your defense or not?  What if you're wrong?  There's always  the court-martial.  But I'm not wrong.  (sighing)  You're a hell of a lawyer,   Sarah.  Dalton, I, um...  Uh... you could  have come to me  before taking the case,  I would have understood.  It won't happen again.  You have a responsibility  to this firm...  and to me.  I know my responsibilities,   Dalton.  I spent a lot of time   and trouble  getting you this job.  Not to mention getting me   into bed.  Don't go there.  This isn't about that.  Oh, we're already there. We both know why   you got me this job,  and it has nothing to do   with my lawyering skills.  You're wrong...  and you do us both  a disservice.  I think it'd be best...  if I left the firm.  You can't.  Excuse me?  You can't leave  someplace  you've never been to...  and you were never here.  I mean, not really, Sarah.  You seduced me, Dalton...  not just into bed--  I don't mind that.  You seduced me   into your world: The money,  the prestige,   the gold name on the door...  And what's wrong with that?  It's not me. I need to be   in a courtroom,  not behind a desk   writing briefs.  (sighing)  You're right.  I never was here because I don't   belong here.  I am sorry if I misled you,  but I can't be   your briefcase carrier.  (sighing)  Say something.  I'm very...  angry with you...  and very...  disappointed  and... very...  very...  Did you hear what   I have to say?  I-I can't work   here anymore.  I don't care  where you work...  as long as  you come home to me.  Is there any other evidence   to be presented?  No, sir.  No further evidence,  sir.  JUDGE:   Very well.  It is the finding  of this inquiry that there is... insufficient evidence   to warrant a court-martial.  I shall recommend to   the convening authority  that the charges against  Lieutenant Commander Rabb be dismissed.  I suppose you think  I owe you now.  Oh, you bet.  MATTONI:  Nice play, Mac.  No hard feelings,  I hope, Rabb.  Absolutely not.  See you around, Mattoni. Hey, Rabb...  Congratulations.  Webb, I don't know   whether to thank you or ram your teeth   down your throat.  Parlovsky's back   in Moscow.  It's a pity.  We could have learned  a lot from him.  Oh, well, our paths   will cross again.  Hey, Commander...  The Navy takes care   of its own, doesn't it?  It's over, Novack.  Let it go.  The Navy may think  it's over.  The U.S. Attorney   disagrees.  The Director had a talk  with the Attorney General.  The theme was:  "Are military officers   above civilian law?"  Guess what the answer was?  Don't leave town,  Commander.  Don't let them  spoil your day.  I won't.  Well...  I guess this   is "good-bye" again.  Well, actually...  could I talk to you  about something?  I realize my leaving was abrupt  but I never meant you or JAG  any disrespect, sir.  It's just...  I felt I had to take advantage  of the opportunity.  It was a mistake, sir.  I think  I still have something  to offer.  So, with permission, sir,   I'd like to resume my duties.  Admiral, what Mac is trying   to say, sir,  is that returning to JAG   is not a fallback position.  What about your  long-term career goals?  How do I know you won't   feel like, uh...  spreading your wings  again next week? Well, sir, I could offer  a lengthy argument  as to why   you should take me back.  I could talk  about serving  my profession  or my country.  The simple fact is,   JAG is where I belong.  Admiral, if she   leaves again  I will personally keel-haul...  Commander,   if I were you,  I would stop helping.  If it wasn't for   top-level intervention, you would be in your cell   facing charges for brig break!  Yes, sir.  My request for resignation?  I got too busy to process it.  Thank you, sir.  It's good to be back.  That remains to be seen, Major.  Dismissed.  Aye, aye, sir.  "Spreading your wings"?  Never mind.  Hey, Harm... thanks for trying.  Does this mean  we're even?  Not even close.  Sir, this package   came for you.  Does this mean that   you're coming back?  Looks that way, Bud.  (both laughing)  BUD:  Welcome back, then.  We all missed you.  MacKENZIE:  Thank you, Bud.  What is that?  "This one is real."  Parlovsky?  Who is this, Harm?  RABB:   My father.  It was taken in 1980.
