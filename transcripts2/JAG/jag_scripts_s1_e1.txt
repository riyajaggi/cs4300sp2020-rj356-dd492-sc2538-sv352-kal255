 JAG (1995–2005): Season 1, Episode 1 - A New Life - full transcript 
 A woman radar-intercept officer (RIO) disappears at night from an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea. Two lawyers in the JAG Corps of the US Navy, Lt. Harm Rabb and Lt. Caitlin "Kate" Pike, investigate. Two Italian fishermen discover the body of the missing person. Despite resentment and resistance from several sources, Harm and Kate sort through the evidence, and they find the answers. Harm, a former Naval aviator, gets a ride in the back seat in combat aboard an F-14 Tomcat, of the type which he previously flew; while doing so, after the bird sustains damage, and the pilot loses consciousness, Harm flies back to the carrier and makes a successful landing at night.

 0-8. We're on our way. Two targets, CAG. 70 miles. Closed rate 1,200 knots. Looks like MIG 21s. Do you have them on video? Negative. How do you know they're Fishbeds? Educated guess, CAG. Target size is small, and previous Serb No-Fly violators have been Fishbeds. We don't guess in this man's Navy, Lieutenant Arutti. No, sir! 50 miles. Phoenix are fire-and-forget. You can shoot them anytime, CAG. Did I request a Phoenix?

 No, sir. Stand it down. But, sir! Does your intercom malfunctioning, Lieutenant? No, sir. Phoenix standing down. We're being painted! I have ears. 20 miles! Picking them up on video. Two Fishbeds over the atolls, sir. Combat spread. I'll take them both. Cover my six. Roger that. We're taking them on alone? You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? Nine miles! They've locked on! You ever been in a knife fight, Arutti? Missile inbound! Where's the other bogie? I- I lost him. Bogie on your six, CAG. How we doing, Lieutenant? Lieutenant, are you with me? To hell and back, sir. To hell and back. Gear down and locked. Hook down. 1-3-5 on the glide path. 5-1-1, Tomcat and Ball. Roger. Ball. Tomcat! 1-1-2, You're a mile and a quarter. Tow the Ball! 1-3-5 on glide path. Tomcat, 1-1-2. Ball, 3.6. JAG Congratulations, sir! I take it the word is out? You bet! Chief, if I bagged a Klingon, I believe you'd know what flag to paint on her. Klingons are easy, sir. Now, a Romulan warship, that might be a problem. They're invisible. (Flight deck crew cheering) Yeah! Tomcat! Congratulations on busting your cherry. I'm sorry, ma'am. It's just a term we use when you get your first kill. I'm familiar with the term, Chief. and I suggest you come up with something, more appropriate for today's Navy. Yes, ma'am. Sir! Sir, may I have a word with you before debriefing? Do you want to know why I didn't use the Phoenix? Ye- Yes, sir. What's a Phoenix missile cost, Lieutenant? A million dollars, sir. You think a couple of camel jockeys are worth that kind of money? Serbs don't ride camels, sir. Well, they fly like they do. Sir, that doesn't explain why we took them on alone. I wanted to see if you had the guts for a knife fight. And you don't. That's not fair, sir. Well hell, I don't have to be fair, Lieutenant. I'm the CAG. Buster to Bravo. Working party in the post office. Way to smoke them, girl! Up close and personal! P-POW! I didn't smoke them, Painter. CAG did. Don't be giving the chauffeur credit! Why not? He deserves it. Hey, hey Angela. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be? You certainly don't seem like the person, who just made the cover of Time magazine. Time? I thought it was Playboy. Mace, you're such a jerk. See? That's more like it! You know what, pard? I think the lady wet her panties up there. Angela? No way, man. She's I ce. Yeah, well Ice melts when it gets hot. 50 miles. Phoenix are fire-and-forget. You can shoot them anytime, CAG. Did I request a Phoenix? Stand it down. But, sir! Is your intercom malfunctioning, Lieutenant? No, sir. Phoenix standing down. We're being painted! I have ears. 20 miles! Picking them up on video. Two Fishbeds over the atolls, sir. Combat spread. I'll take them both. Cover my six. We're taking them on alone? You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? Nine miles! You ever been in a knife fight, Arutti? Missile inbound! ♫ Hip-Hop Music ♫ You've got it! You can do it! Com'on. Let's go! Com'on! Jesus! Let's go. You've got it. Come on, buddy! Come on! Come on! You've got it! (Crowd cheering) Your turn, Ripper. Come on, Rip. Com'on, let's go. Come on, Rip. Come on, man. Com'on! Ready? That's it, guy! Come on, buddy! Press them, Rip! Let's go! Com'on, com'on! Push it. Com'on. Try, man. Don't let her beat you! Don't let her! Push! Come on, man! Com'on Rip, do it! Try! Try! I can't! Take it! Take it! Com'on... (Crowd disappointed) You disappoint me, pal! That's the third bottle of Jack you owe me this cruise. Oh.. boy! How many is that, Rip? When are you gonna give up? Never. Cassie may be ripped, but she still squats, and no squatter's gonna out-press me. Well, this one did. It's gotta be a trick. Maybe she wanted it more than you did, Rip. She's on 'roids, Keeter. No way! They'd show up in her flight physical. That's right. So, you're saying the flight surgeon's looking the other way. The Navy'd do anything to make these squatters look good. There are limits, Rip. No. There's not. Hey... Hey. I just took Ripper for another bottle of Jack. Why do you do it? You know he's only going to get you more wave-offs. The scuttlebutt says a TV reporter's coming, on the morning COD to interview you. I don't want to be interviewed. Everybody in Wheeling, West Virginia's gonna see you on the tube including that jerk of an ex-boyfriend. I don't care about him. My folks worry enough about me. Let them interview CAG. The press doesn't want to talk to the Ancient Mariner. They want the female warrior who smoked two MIGs. I didn't smoke them. The Ancient Mariner did. Damn it, Angela! I can't take credit for something I didn't do. You didn't screw the pooch up there, did you? No. What's the problem? I don't... I don't want to be a... blurb on the evening news. Until today, the only female aviators the press were talking to, were getting their sixes grabbed at Tailhook. We need blurbs like you. I wouldn't know what to say. Oh, hell. That's easy. So what's it like being a woman in combat? It's the same as being a man in combat. Weren't you frightened? I didn't have time to be frightened, sir. Damn! I near wet my pants. Wouldn't say that. It's the truth. I was so scared up there, Cassie. So? Every time I make a night trap, my heart's in my throat. Fear can be useful. It sharpens the senses. It can give you an edge. It gives me doubts. Where are you going? I gotta get some air. Just air? Damn it, Angela! (Launch cycle operations) 3-2-0. on deck. Coming up on the starboard side! 3-4 Heavy weather Now all over, all hatches, go to cover. Ahh... Oh, God! I need you tonight. Fuel spill on deck. 9-2-2 is clear. Move 24 to the 25, tie down, and clean it up. Move 24 to the 25, tie down, and clean it up. I'm gonna get her tomorrow, Keeter. You're just gonna lose another bottle of Jack. Hey! You wanna bet? What? Nothing. (F-14B ramping up) NOOOO! From the NBC Studios in Burbank, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno! Featuring Kevin Eubanks and The Tonight Show band. And now,  Jayyyyyyy.... Leno! Ah, this just in, one of the Navy F-14 Tomcat, shot down a couple of Serbian MIGs over Bosnia this afternoon. Listen to this, the radar, intercept officer in the Tomcat was a woman! Boy! You thought getting shot down by a woman in a bar was bad?! Oh my God! You watching this, Teddy? Oh yes, sir. If admiral Drake were smart, he'd make this RIO more famous than Amelia Earhart. She's missing, sir. Did anybody tell FDR? Sir? That Amelia Earhart was missing? Oh... No, sir. She's not missing. I guess she is missing, sir, but that's not who I'm referring to. I meant Lieutenant Arutti. Who's Lieutenant Arutti? The female RIO that Jay Leno's talking about, sir. She disappeared at sea last night. Think we can lay this off on NIS? Not after reading this, sir. It just came in from CINC-Med. Damn! Who's available? Captain Morton is our senior officer in Naples, sir. He can be on the Seahawk within the hour. Yeah, and in a spitting contest with the ship's captain 10 minutes later. No, I want a junior officer, so that the Seahawk's skipper isn't intimidated by the investigation. You're sure you want to trust this to a junior officer, sir? You wanna take it, Teddy? I think my current duties would preclude an immediate departure, sir. You have the survival instincts of a politician, Teddy. Where's Lieutenant Rabb? Ahh... Probably at the French Embassy, sir. It's Bastille Day. Most of our people attend that party. Well, I want him on a jet to Naples in 30 minutes. Aye, aye, sir. Make that 20 minutes. Yes, sir! And, Teddy? Sir? Send a female JG with him. A female, sir? Yes. I want a woman on the team in case we have to face the press. And, Teddy? Sir? Make sure she's easy on the eyes, ah? Yes, sir. Another thing about that female aviator, now, this has got to be very embarrassing, to Bill Clinton and Dan Quayle. Now women their daughters' age, have more combat experience than they do. He he. (Audience laughing) He he he. There she is! Ha ha ha ha. My first time on a carrier! You, too? The men of the Tie offer a big welcome aboard, to their family and friends on this 4th of July! Here you go, Harm! Yeah! Some day, son, a stick and throttle like that'll take you to the moon. Watch your step, ma'am. Thank you. Ohh. Welcome to the carrier, ma'am. Thank you. Lieutenant Rabb! Ensign Bud Roberts, Public Affairs Officer. Skipper assigned me to be your escort onboard the Seahawk, sir. Something wrong, Ensign? No, sir! Skipper's requested that you report immediately to the navigations bridge. So if you could stick to my six... That's what pilots call their tail, I'll lead the way. You a pilot, Ensign? No, ma'am. It's just that everybody uses pilot jargon on a carrier. Bolter! (Aircraft fails to catch an arrestor cable) What happened?! He didn't trap, touched down long, missed all four wires. I didn't know Lieutenant Rabb served on a carrier, ma'am. Neither did I. That bolter's Lieutenant Arutti's roommate, CAG. Are you sure she should be flying today? If Puller was a man, would you give him a day off to get it together? Yes, sir. One moment. CAG, skipper's on the horn for you, sir. How many is that? 3 miles. Skipper? Damn, CAG. He looks like Hammer. Yeah? Too bad he couldn't fly like him. I thought it was a night vision problem. So they say, Skipper. Excuse me, sir. Since you know your way around, I'll be waiting for you in the officer's wardroom. I also have to baby-sit the press today. Not that I was saying that I was baby-sitting you, sir. There's a reporter onboard? Yes, sir. And a cameraman. They came to interview Lieutenant Arutti, before we knew she was missing. Skipper ordered me to sit on them until he decides what to do. When did they arrive? On the morning COD. Excuse me, sir, the skipper wants you on the bridge! Ma'am? Oh... Attention! GFG one narrow, report to the command master chief. Hey Borini! Borini! Wake up! The Good Humour Man is here. And he's got a good humour lady with him. Ah? Excuse me, sir. Do you have any chocolate chip? Or rocky road. Ensign, you think you could rustle up some ice cream? Sir. Yes, sir. Did you check out their insignias, Borini? I haven't gotten that high. They're JAG officers. Now what would a pair of naval lawyers in dress whites, be doing on a carrier in the middle of the Med? Whatever it is, I'll tape it. Don't I know you? We met about 15 years ago in Bangkok, sir. Ah! You... God! Harm, right? Harmon Rabb, Jr. Go-lly! His old man is an MIA. At 16, he sneaked into North Vietnam to look for him. That was a very gutsy move. A very futile one, sir. That doesn't make it any less gutsy. We only have strawberry, sir. Ensign. Why don't you and Lieutenant Pike, escort Mr Borini to the flight deck? I'm sure he'd love to shoot some b-roll. Yes, sir. I'll pick you up on the way to report. Attention, attention. Re-enlistment ceremony for HMC Caleb, will be held on the fantail at 1600 hours. You grew up. It happens. I thought you'd be wearing wings like your old man. Want some of this? No, thanks. So they hustle you out here from Naples? From Washington. Without a chance to change uniforms? The Navy must have a big problem here. Why do I feel like we're about to negotiate something? Ha ha ha. We need you to sit on a story for a while. I knew it! Admiral Drake. He's so hard up for good press, he jumped the gun, right? That female RIO didn't bag those MIGs, did she? I don't know. Come on, Harm. You know, I'm ex-special forces. I like the military. I'm not gonna cover it like The Navy Times, but I'll put a fair slant on it. She's missing. Did her plane go down? No. She disappeared sometime last night. Ahh eh. I can't. I can't sit on that. I'll give you an exclusive. Hey, I'm the only reporter out here, pal. I already got an exclusive. All you have is that she's missing. You flash that to the world, and the press that doesn't share your affection for the military, will have a field day speculating why. I need time. Time to cover up what happened? Time to find out what happened. (Sigh) I- I'll tell you what. You get me a ride, over Bosnia, and I won't file for 12 Hours. Twenty-four. Ah! Well, see, now, that's gonna cost you two rides, and an exclusive. I thought you had an exclusive. He he he he he. You... Ahh! Uhm. Lieutenant Richardson, your presence is requested to CIC. Hey, brother. You want some ice cream? It's good. Yumm mm mm. No? Sorry. 1-6-6 Tomcat. Ball. 3. 1. Roger. Ball! Let's see if she traps this time. Lieutenants Rabb and Pike reporting as ordered, sir. Evidently, Lieutenant Rabb, you believe, eating ice cream has priority, over reporting to the commanding officer. No, sir! Then you better explain your actions, mister. I was on my way to report, when I learned a news crew was onboard, and being held incommunicado. By my orders. Until I know why Lieutenant Arutti's missing, no damn reporter's going to speculate about it on TV. I concur, sir. That's why I was having ice cream with Mr DePalma. He's agreed to sit on the story for 24 hours. It must have been great ice cream. It was, sir. But he wouldn't agree to anything, until I promised him a pair of rides over Bosnia. On my six, mister. If you'll excuse us, gentlemen. Aye, aye, sir. Aye, aye, sir. Now, you promised what? Sir, if Mr DePalma doesn't contact his bureau desk soon, they'll want to know why. We can't deny he's onboard, sir. I can deny any damn thing I want. Yes, sir! Damn captain's privilege. Yes, sir. At ease. CAG? My boys aren't here to fly tourists, Skipper. Well, I guess you made a promise you can't keep, Lieutenant. It's in the Navy's interest to keep it, sir. That may be, but I'm not going to overrule the CAG, especially when I agree with him. With all due respect, sir, I'm in charge of a possible murder investigation, which gives me the latitude to authorise those rides. Those are my men and my machines, Lieutenant, and no damn JAG lawyer's gonna tell me what to do with them. Understood? Yes, sir. And I respectfully disagree. That's enough. We'll discuss the parameters of your authority in a minute. You mentioned a murder investigation. You know something I don't, Lieutenant? CINC-Med in Naples received an encrypted message, from the Seahawk at 0500 this morning. It contained just three words. "She was murdered." You have whoever sent that message to CINC-Med, on my quarterdeck by sunset, Mr Lubin, or you'll spend the rest of your tour, sending semaphore to Eskimos. That message could have been sent from crypto, a STU-lll or one of the aircraft. It won't be traceable, sir. "Won't" isn't in my language, Lieutenant. If Lieutenant Arutti was murdered, I'll catapult whoever did it off the deck at high noon, in front of the ship's company. Yes, sir. Your investigation will be given full cooperation. but let me warn the two of you. This is a ship of war, engaged in an action, that will most certainly grow in intensity. I will not have you interfere with the ability, of this ship and its crew to carry out that mission. Understood, sir. Dismissed. Aye, aye, sir! Lieutenant Rabb? Yes, sir. How's your mother? She's fine, sir. She opened an art gallery in La Jolla a few years ago. She still married to the used car salesman? Yes, sir. You give her my regards the next time you speak to her. I'll do that, Skipper. Thank you. I thought you said that your stepfather was a senior V.P. At Chrysler. He is. Still think Lieutenant Arutti committed suicide? Yes, sir. Either way, Washington's going to be on my six. But it's not your fault, Skipper. And maybe this will force Washington to realise, that a battle carrier's no place for women. CAG, for the sake of your career, keep those opinions to yourself. We didn't have a chance to grab a toothbrush. Do you think you could scare us up a change of uniform? I'll be able to find something for you, sir. I'm not so sure about Lieutenant Pike. Lieutenant Arutti was about your size, ma'am. You're not suggesting I wear a dead officer's uniform? No. No, no. Of course not. But hers are the only ones that would fit, ma'am. Look elsewhere. Yes, ma'am. Where's female officer country? 03 level, after the wardroom. So, Lieutenant Arutti was amply endowed? Yes, sir. Very. She turned a few heads, then, did she? They all do, sir. She turn anyone's head in particular? Navy regs do not permit fraternisation, ma'am. Men and women at sea together for six months, and the regs don't get bent a little? Not that I'm aware of, sir. Excuse me. (Announcing presence) Male personnel on deck! You have to loudly announce yourself, and then wait, 30 seconds before entering. Does that include me? Alpha, B-21, Alpha. Lieutenant Puller's flying, but I like to knock anyway. I guess they bunk the RIO's together. No, no, no. Lieutenant Puller's a pilot. She flies Tomcats. Computer. Yep. Ensign, why don't you go see about those uniforms? Ah, yes, sir. Sir, you know, I could... Anything? Windows 95. Most of the more sophisticated bells and whistles. Here we go. There's two personal codes. She must share the computer with her roommate. I wonder which one of these is Lieutenant Arutti's? Mom, dad, and little sister. How do you know? I just do. Can you get in? Of course. Can you? (Typing on the keyboard) She sleeps on the bottom. Top. Wanna bet on who gets in first? But you've got a head start. What a man! Thank you, but you still have a head start. You wanna bet or whine? Bet. (Typing on the keyboard) I'm in! What the hell is this? JAG investigation into your shipmate's disappearance. I'm Lieutenant Rabb. This is Lieutenant Pike. That gives you the right to break into my lockbox? Sorry, Lieutenant. I thought it was Lieutenant Arutti's. What did you do? Flip a coin or did you go "Eenie meenie miney moe"? Is that my programme? No. It's Lieutenant Arutti's. How'd you get her password? I didn't. I just came off a long mission. I need to go and work out. I'll wait outside. Why? Never seen a naked sailor before? Birth control pills. They regulated her period. That's what Angela said they were for, and I believed her. Tape recorder. Yeah. She taped her mission, and she studied it later. She was very dedicated. There's nothing on this. Well, I guess she erased it when she was done. Look, I got a CAP to fly at 0400. When I get back, I want you two gone. I gotta get some rack time. I'm gonna need to interview you at some point. Angela was a good RIO. A good shipmate. That's all I know. You know she taped her missions. You know she took birth control pills to regulate her period. I'm sure there's a few other things you know, too. Stay out of my lockbox. Stay out of my programme. Ahh... Did you see the muscles on her? I wasn't looking at her muscles. Anything? Hmm... Educational and flight programs, a few games, and... one letter to mom, dad, and little sister. You don't see anything odd? No. That's the first letter home from a sailor on a six-month cruise that doesn't mention being lonely. Women don't get as lonely as men. Gee... I wonder why. Not all women in the Navy feel the way you do about having a lover. Thank God! Okay. It's possible Lieutenant Arutti had a lover. Or two. Now she's a slut? No! But with 5,000 men and only a handful of women on this ship, a love triangle wouldn't surprise me. A love quadrangle wouldn't surprise you. Why are you so adversarial, Kate? We're supposed to be on the same team. (Clearing throat) Sorry. I've just worked more cases against you than with you. Believe me, it's more fun to be on the winning side. We're on the same case! Sir? Ma'am? I've arranged quarters for you. Great. What about uniforms? I'm still working on that. But I can take your covers and purse. Thank you, Ensign. Thank you. I'll put these in your quarters. Oh, God. You here for a cocktail party, Harm? Lieutenant Pike, Lieutenant Mace. My RIO, Painter. So, you're a JAG lawyer now. That's right. Here to investigate Lieutenant Arutti's disappearance? Right again. Ah. That's one way to a... serve on a carrier. You two a team? Not usually. But CINC-Med needed a couple of JAG officers out here FAST. They stuck us together. Is it a match made in heaven? We're working on it. Any idea who murdered Angela? Who said she was murdered? Scuttlebutt. She couldn't have fallen overboard or committed suicide? Angela wouldn't do that. Fall overboard or commit suicide? She wasn't accident-prone, all right? And she wasn't depressed. If she went over the side, she was pushed. We have a briefing. Ohh... Was he in love with her? Well, she and Painter were, pretty tight in RIO School. But she's been an, Ice queen to everyone on this cruise. Even me. (Sigh) I take it that's unusual. Very. Any idea who started this murder scuttlebutt? Don't ask me, Harm. You're the JAG investigator. Hell, I'm just a guy with gold wings and an F-14 to play with. Listen, hmm... why don't you, ah... come up to the flight deck in about an hour and I'll show you how night traps are supposed to be done? He doesn't like you! We're not here to be liked, Kate. Oh! He likes me. It's you he's got a problem with. Where do you know him from? We served together a while back. Harm, were you a pilot? I think Lieutenant Painter sent that message to CINC-Med. You didn't answer my question. That's because it's none of your business, Kate. Okay, Harm. It's pizza night and my stomach's growling. What say we trap this time? I kind of like going around in the moonlight. What moonlight? It's blacker than the inside of a coal miner's nose out here. Tomcat, 1-7-3. You're at a mile and a quarter. Call the Ball. 1-7-3, Tomcat, Clara, 3.8. Bend left, Harm. 1-7-3, Tomcat, Ball! 3.7. Roger. Ball. Below the glide path, Harm. I'm on the glide path. You're a little low. You're a little low! Power! Power! Power! What is it, Teddy? You're wanted at the White House, sir. The White House? They say why? No, sir. But a flash just came through. that the Serbs downed one of our C-130s over Sarajevo. What's the President want me to do? Sue them? It's that Seahawk incident. If that missing RIO was a male, it wouldn't have gotten beyond his group commander. But you lose a woman at sea, and they call me to the White House. Anything new from Lieutenant Rabb? Not much, sir. He still doesn't know whether it was an accident, murder, or suicide. I don't want to hear suicide or murder. No, sir. Unless he has insurmountable proof to the contrary, I want a finding of accidental death. Lieutenant Rabb understands that, doesn't he? Yes, sir. I made it quite clear. Did the reporter break the story? Not yet, sir. I wonder what that cost us. I don't know, sir. But if you wish, I could contact the Lieutenant and ask him what he... No, no. What I don't know, I don't have to testify to on the hill. You think there'll be a Senate investigation, sir? Well, if the finding is suicide, the feminists are gonna want a hearing. And if it's murder, the anti-feminists are gonna want one. So, unless Lieutenant Arutti fell overboard accidentally, one of those is gonna wanna, attack the credibility of our investigation. Don't worry, Teddy. Junior officers get thrown to the sharks first. And Lieutenant Rabb is the one who's, sailing into harm's way. Yes, sir. Harm's way? Lieutenant Rabb's first name is Harm. Oh! Oh, Yes, sir. You need a sense of humour, Teddy. Otherwise people are gonna think you're a lawyer. I am a lawyer, sir. It was in the bottom of the safety net between the tower and the number three elevator, sir. Wouldn't you have to hang over the deck, to see into the bottom of that net, Chief? Yes, sir. See, I was checking the tie-downs on my bird, before hitting the rack, and, when I was done, I laid on the edge of the deck to watch the bow wave. That's how I spotted the cap in the bottom of the net. Thank you, Chief. That'll be all. Sir, I just want to add that... Lieutenant Arutti was a real nice girl, Skipper. And I'm gonna miss her. He's used to losing men in action, not a woman to suicide. How do you know it was suicide, sir? You don't stroll off a flight deck, Lieutenant. Even at night. Too many safety nets. You have to jump. Or be thrown off. No member of this crew threw a woman overboard, Lieutenant. With all due respect to your opinion, sir, there are over 5,000 men onboard. She committed suicide. Was she depressed, sir? I'm not a damn shrink, Lieutenant. She was your RIO. And an officer under your command, sir. Surely you must have an opinion as to her mental state. Whatever that is, Lieutenant, I do not intend to discuss it on an open bridge. Well then, where and when, sir? At my damn convenience and wherever I damn well please! Sir, we have to recommend to a board of inquiry what we feel... Lieutenant Pike... the CAG has said he will be interviewed at his convenience. Yes, sir. By your leave, sir. We have to talk. We do? You're damn right we do. "Sir." "Damn right we do, sir." I found some uniforms, but I can't vouch for the fit, ma'am. They're not Lieutenant Arutti's? No. Lieutenant Puller gave you one of hers. She did? Ah ah. Surprised me, too. She says her uniform will fit. I guess it's because of, how tall you are and how big her chest... Ah.. Ah.. If you just stick to my six, I'll lead you to your quarters. Not a word! Security patrol to Charlie here... Ah, so, you found her cap? How'd you know? I'm a reporter, remember? That's my job. Yeah. They found it in a net... Yeah, I know. Near the number three elevator. So, it looks like suicide, then. No. No? No. That's a very emphatic negative, Lieutenant Pike. Do you know something I don't know? I don't believe it was suicide. Oh! And you have anything to base that on? I mean, other than, gender identification? Ohh.. I'm being targeted. So, ah, I fly in the morning, right? Right. Because if I don't, my story will.
