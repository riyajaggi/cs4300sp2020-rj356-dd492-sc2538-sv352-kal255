 50 miles. Phoenix are fire-and-forget. You can shoot them anytime, CAG. Combat spread. I'll take them both. Cover my six. We're taking them on alone? You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? Oh, God! I need you tonight. JAG I am 27 years old, a Harvard Law School graduate, and a lieutenant in the same Navy as you! Don't treat me as anything less! The CAG was about to send a Sidewinder up your six.

 I can defend myself. Ticking him off is not gonna help our investigation. Oh... Is that strictly your prerogative? I know the guy, Kate. I know when to push and when to walk away. This was a time to walk away. How do you know the CAG? He was my dad's wingman the day he went down. You know, Kate, maybe DePalma's right. Your gender is blinding your objectivity. At this point in the investigation, the CAG's suicide theory is as plausible as murder.

 You'd realise that if Lieutenant Arutti wasn't female. And if she was male, would the CAG be talking suicide? He knows damn well that if the first female in combat commits suicide, the Navy will re-evaluate the entire programme. Okay, you're both pursuing theories based on gender bias. And you're not? No. I like the idea of going to sea with women. Those wings look good on you. Well, you know what they say about gold wings and dress whites. They'll get you in bed anywhere. Hehehe, Except here. July 16, 11:28 The White House, Washington, D.C I heard they dragged you over here. You didn't send for me, Admiral? Not me. I'm here to sell the President on the idea of an alpha strike, as payback for that C-130 the Serbs knocked down. An alpha strike? Who was on that bird? (Sigh) A "M.A.S.H" unit, on a humanitarian mission. We lost 50 medical people. Oh, my God! The UN's authorised us to hit their SAM missile sites. Now, Wayne's trying to weasel a special forces raid, and Freaky's over there begging for an Air Force strike. But the secretary, likes my idea of an all-Navy operation, from the sea. Great press for the Navy, admiral. Yeah. If that missing female officer aboard the Seahawk doesn't ruin it. My people are on that, sir. You know, Admiral, there's a news crew, on the Seahawk. that my investigating officer is sitting on. Now, if you should get the go on alpha strike, you might consider letting them cover it for you. It could... it could dilute any, any negatives that this missing female officer created. Gentlemen. the President will see you in the war room. Good idea, Al. Do it! Good luck, sir. You, too, Al. Who the hell sent for us? Admiral Brovo? Yes, ma'am. This way, sir. The first lady is anxious to hear about your Seahawk investigation. 1-6-6. Tomcat. Ball. 4.8. Roger. Ball. 1-6-6, you're below glide path. Below glide path. 1-6-6, do you still have the Ball? 1-6-6. Roger. Ball. You just had to out-press him, didn't you? He can't wave us off forever. That's true. We'll be out of fuel soon. Considering the conditions, she's doing pretty well! This bitch couldn't fly a weather balloon. 1-6-6, go around! Go around! Not this time, Ripper. The deck was rising and her approach was low. I had no other choice but to wave her off, sir. Keeter? She was a little low, sir. I made the trap, sir. You caught the number one wire which means your tail cleared the ramp by three feet. Sir, I was bingo fuel. I knew I could make it. Well, hell, Lieutenant, why have LSOs at all? We may as well save the Navy the money. Put these men back in the cockpit where they'd rather be anyway. Lieutenant, you have the worst trap record on this ship. I'm not sure you could land a Tomcat at Dulles without a wave-off. Yes, sir! If you ever ignore an LSO again, your next flight will be a one-way trip on the COD to Naples. Yes, sir. Dismissed. Ripper! (Sigh) You don't like female pilots, do you, son? No, sir. I do not. Neither do I. I don't believe they have the stomach for battle. You got that right, CAG. But if one of my LSO's, ever, intentionally waved a pilot off because she was a female, I'd keelhaul him. Do we understand each other, mister? Yes, sir. Dismissed. Sir, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Where'd you get the flight suit? Ensign Roberts. I'd like to talk to you about Lieutenant Arutti. I have a mission to fly. CAG. How did Lieutenant Arutti perform on that last mission? It's all in the debrief. I've read it. It describes the action. Doesn't tell me much about her performance. I have nothing to say beyond my report. First time in combat can be confusing. Now how would you know that, Lieutenant? My father told me. You were five years old when Hammer went down. He sent my mom 18 letter tapes home from Nam. I've listened to them 100 times. Your early reports, CAG. Lieutenant Arutti made tapes, too. Is that how you get your kicks, Lieutenant? Listening to her private tapes? They weren't letters home, sir. She taped her missions. You have a tape of our mission? No, sir. She erased it. Well, that's too bad. It could have saved me this inquisition. Attention on deck! Carry on, men. You sure you're up to this, Mr DePalma? Heh... No problem, Captain. The Air Force gave me a ride in an F-16. I did just fine. Lieutenant Mace, when Mr DePalma's ready, you take him topside and familiarise him, with the cockpit and ejection procedures. Aye, aye, sir. Mr DePalma, we will be flying a Tomcat that has been modified for recon, and training missions. There's a complete set of controls in your cockpit but if you touch anything other than your personal joystick, I'll eject you over the Adriatic and forget where I did it. Yes, sir. You want a ride, Harm? You don't seem too popular, Lieutenant. Your debrief says you took one MIG with a Sidewinder, and the other with 20 mike-mike. That's right. You had Phoenix missiles. Right again. Why risk a $35 million bird in a knife fight, if you don't have to? I didn't view it as a risk. Are we through, Lieutenant? No, sir. Just one last question. Were you testing her guts or yours? Because of your old man, I didn't hear that. But if you would care to repeat it... Lieutenant Rabb. Lieutenant Rabb. Your presence is requested in crypto on the 02 Level. Lieutenant Rabb to crypto. What's up? Proof. Proof of what? Lieutenant Rabb, Lieutenant Lubin. So you're Rabb? Hehe. Zane and I graduated from the Academy together. Yeah. I never would have made it through without her. CPO Williams, proceed to the mess hall. I helped him get through calculus. I got to run, I Sure hope I don't get my six keelhauled for this. Sure you know how to work this thing? Thanks, Zane. I'll collect later. Collect what? Listen. Two targets, CAG. 70 miles. This was erased. But not recorded over. Zane helped me restore it. Do you have them on video? ...No-Fly violators have been Fishbeds. We don't guess in this... Navy. Did I request a Phoenix? Stand it down. We're taking them on alone?! You have a problem with that, Lieutenant? I- lost him! Lieutenant, are you with me? To hell and back, sir. He was busting her butt, Harm. She was questioning his decisions, Kate. Maybe her questions were valid. Like the ones I ask you. That's okay in an investigation, not in combat. She was hesitant. Shaky. Scared. So? She was scared. It was her first time in combat. Why shouldn't she be scared? Hello? Are you receiving me? She probably wanted this since she was a kid. Put her entire life into becoming a Naval aviator. Then on her first combat mission, she finds she doesn't have the right stuff. According to the CAG. Well, who better to know? So a few harsh words and she commits suicide? People have done it for less. You mean women, don't you? Come on, Kate. I'm not a chauvinist. Yes, you are. You just don't know it. Ha ha ha. Harm. If you write this up, as a suicide, I'll submit a dissenting position. You can't. We're not a board of inquiry. We're a two-man team, and the senior member writes the finding. Two-man? Okay, Kate. So I'm a little chauvinistic. Yeah. I thought you'd find that charming. Not in an investigation. Look. I'm like a hung jury. I need something solid to swing me one way or the other. Okay. Zane believes that message to CINC-Med, was sent from one of the aircraft. I checked the logs and guess who was flying, when CINC-Pac received it? Mace and Painter. Right! That doesn't prove she was murdered. Lieutenant Painter was in love with her. He wouldn't want her death to look like suicide any more than Lieutenant Puller, who could have also sent that message from a STU-lll. Hmm.. Zane didn't think it originated from a STU-lll. When did Zane join our investigation? I'm looking for answers. Well, what else did Zane, who's going to collect later, tell you? He said he knew a secure area in the fantail, where he and I could do it. The altimeter reads, 30,000 feet. Not a foot above, or a foot below. This pilot, is very precise. Seahawk, Seahawk, CAG. Feet dry. The CAG has just called feet dry, meaning we've crossed the Dalmatian Coast and are entering the No-Fly zone. Mr DePalma, how are you doing? I'm Fine! Just fine. Is it hot in here? I mean, I'm a little hot, but other than that I'm just fine.. Thanks. I'm afraid you're in for a dull time. AWACS says it doesn't look like the Serbs wanna play today. Awww.... Gee... That's too bad. I... I was really looking forward to a dogfight. How about... If I simulate what happened last time? Oh... Yeah. That would be great! I mean, really! Combat spread. Cover my six. Roger that. Harness locked? Yes. Right. Locked. At five miles, we pick up their missile inbound. I release chaff and break hard right. Awwww... Ahhhhhh... To the left burner. 9 G turn. Right here, I'm... starting to red out. I'm on his six. Whoever breaks first goes straight to hell. Aghhhhh..... Now I'm on his six. I'm on his six. Now steady. Now steady. We got a lock. And missile away! Awwwww.... 100% oxygen usually works. (Throwing up) Ha ha ha ha. Always working. Antonio. Help here. Antonio?! Help me out! She had fresh abrasions on the tips of her fingers which would be consistent with slipping and hanging from the edge of a deck until she fell. An accidental death? I found nothing during the autopsy to indicate otherwise. Lieutenant Arutti suffered a... pelvic fracture and ruptured spleen, which are impact traumas consistent with high falls. And the cause of death was a wet drowning. There are dry drownings, sir? Occasionally. The victim suffers a sudden laryngospasm, (spasm of the vocal cords) caused by water in the throat. But this victim died by aspirating large volumes of sea water into her lungs. Spleen injury might have been fatal if not immediately treated. So it contributed to her death? In so far as it inhibited her ability to swim. She probably sank, held her breath as long as possible, then, fighting for air, swallowed sea water till her respiration stopped. You have her personal effects? One boot was missing. There were no rings, bracelets, or wallet. Just dog tags, panties, her flight suit and this jacket. Is there anything else you can tell me, Commander? Just that she suffered a slow, agonising death. It wasn't this windy below! We turn into the wind to launch, ma'am. Intruders? Yes, ma'am. Painter, what's Lieutenant Mace got against my partner? He thinks Lieutenant Rabb screwed the pooch on a night trap. Got his RIO killed. Did he screw the pooch? Board of inquiry didn't think so. They said he had an eye infection, impaired his night vision. RIO panicked. Punched them both out over the ramp. But, as Mace says, the RIO wasn't around to tell it any different. But Mace has prejudice. The RIO was his brother. You're a lawyer, right, Lieutenant? If I tell you something, will it stay between us? I'm not your lawyer. I'm the Navy's. If you have something to tell me about Lieutenant Arutti, it won't be privileged but... I'll do what I can to keep it confidential. Angela wrote a letter of resignation after her last mission. She felt she didn't have the guts for combat. She resigned her commission? No, ma'am. I talked her out of it. Hell, we all get scared up there at times. It's just that guys, they hide it. That's why I know she didn't commit suicide. Angela wasn't gonna quit. She was going back to her quarters to erase that letter from her computer. Back from where? From the COD. At night it's tied down after number three elevator. We used to go there to be alone. You were her lover? No, ma'am. I was her husband. Angela and Painter were married? The Navy would never allow them to serve on the same ship, so they kept their marriage secret. But there was no letter of resignation in her computer! Yes, there was. I missed it the first time, because she'd deleted it after talking to Painter. The first time? Well, deleting erases the files... Deleting erases the files so that it can't be accessed, but... the data stays in the memory bank until it's written over. It took me some time, but I dug it out. You are never going to use my computer again. Angela changed her mind about quitting. Now, you don't do that and then commit suicide. I agree. Here are the uniforms you wanted. You agree she didn't commit suicide? The autopsy revealed abrasions on her fingertips. Looks like she slipped, grabbed the edge of the deck as she went over. I think we've got an accidental death here, Kate. Unless she was pushed. By who? Whom. The CAG. Com'on Kate! Lieutenant Rabb? Sir? Just hear me out. He doesn't want women playing with his toys, right? So he sets Angela up to screw the pooch. Which she did. Whether she did or didn't, it still filled her with enough doubt to resign. But Painter changed her mind. She deleted that letter and decided to stick it out. When the CAG realised she wasn't going to resign, he threw her overboard, hoping it would look like suicide. No, wait a minute. When did Angela delete the letter? After she left Painter at the COD. She never made it back to her quarters. She went overboard. So who deleted the letter? Harm? Uffff.... Upffff.... Pfffff.... Pfffff.... Eighh... Ugh... (Coughing) Next time you wave me off for no reason, it'll be your last! Ugh... Agh.. Eiahh... (Coughing) Ugh... What was that about? Ripper's been giving me unnecessary wave-offs. He won't do it again. You're a tough lady, Lieutenant. Do just about anything to prove women belong out here. Yeah, just about. Maybe even toss one overboard to have a dead hero instead of a live quitter. Angela wasn't a quitter. We know she wrote a letter of resignation. I deleted it. I recovered it. (Sigh) And you think I threw her overboard? You're strong enough. If I was bent like that, there's a couple guys who would have went overboard a long time ago. I'm convening a board of inquiry in Naples at 1300 tomorrow. You'll have to be there. I didn't murder Angela, so I'm not afraid to face a board of inquiry. It's gonna have to wait. Scuttlebutt is there's a mission coming up. I can't delay an inquiry based on scuttlebutt. Damn it! And you were a pilot! You know what flying the real thing means to me! I'm sorry. Mace was right about you. Stand by, Refueling the long supported dock One of these days, somebody's gonna throw her overboard. So I heard they recovered Angela's body. Fisherman found it yesterday. It's a damn shame. She was a good kid. She wasn't a kid. You know, I saw Lieutenant Puller topside near the number three elevator the night that Angela went overboard. She was kind of hiding in the shadows. Hiding in the shadows or just getting a little air? It looked more like she was hiding to me. You aren't saying this to get her in trouble, are you? You're damn right, I am. That doesn't change her being there. And why would Lieutenant Puller wanna kill Angela? I don't know. Lovers' quarrel? (Sigh) What a... bastard. Doesn't mean he's lying. You suspect Lieutenant Arutti was murdered, but you don't have any proof? Yes, sir. If I ran the Seahawk the way you two run this investigation, I'd be skippering a submarine at Disneyland. Well, what do you JAG lawyers propose to do next? Convene a board of inquiry to question certain officers under oath, who may be able to shed light on Lieutenant Arutti's disappearance. Which officers? Lieutenant Puller, Painter, Carter, and the CAG. You think one of them threw her overboard. I don't know, sir. I do believe they'll be able to shed light on her disappearance. Well, your board of inquiry is going to have to wait, Lieutenant. The scuttlebutt is true, sir? It usually is. Gather round, gentlemen. It's on? It's on. I've just received orders from CINC-Med Naples. We're to launch an alpha strike at 1800. That will be all, Mr Rabb. Aye, sir. Our targets will be the 28 SAM sites around Sarajevo, and their command control centre at Foca. CAG, I'll need an ATARS run before you launch. I wanna know what's down there. Yes, sir. I'll do it myself. Very good, sir. What's an alpha strike? Everything that flies. So the Tomcats launch first. Establish a CAP and fly escort. Intruders go in low. Smother them with snake eyes. Hornets go high. Nail anything that lights up. This is the real thing, gentlemen, so good hunting. We.. we'd just finished an lmmelmann and then he did a snap, turn 9 G's to the right. Ah... Well, I lost it. I mean, I didn't know which way was up, which... I puked my guts out. Was your cockpit hot? Yeah. Yeah, it was. He turned your heat up. Little heat, couple of negative G's, and Captain Midnight would have puked in that back seat. Why is he so damn abusive? It's just his way of telling me that I don't belong up there. He doesn't think anyone belongs up there except his chosen few. He's right. He's not right. What gives him the right to decide who belongs up there and who doesn't? Twenty-five years and a thousand traps. Yeah, well, that's okay. Everything is fine because the good, Ensign Roberts here, has arranged for me to be filmed in the cockpit after the strike. On the deck, not in the air. No, on the deck. It's okay. Anywhere. With Borini's camera angles, I'll come off looking like Tom Cruise. Mr DePalma, are you ready for your second ride? I got an ATARS mission in 10 minutes. I'm gonna tell you the truth, CAG. I don't think I could ride an elevator without puking. I'll take it. Saddle up. You are just a passenger, mister. Understood. If you're gonna puke, make sure you do it with the intercom off so I don't have to hear you. Just don't turn the heat up in my cockpit, sir. Hello, CAG. Ready to go, chief? All ready, sir. What's an ATARS mission? That's where we go in to acquire our last-minute recon photo of the target. SAM-six is a mobile missile, and we just want to make sure those babies are still where intelligence says they are. You know, your old man's a legend in this squadron. I know. So's the CAG. Good luck to you, sir! Don't even think about it, mister. You ready, Lobo? Ready, CAG. CAG, are we on TAC-2? Why? I have to radio Lieutenant Pike. We're not on the beltway, mister. We're on a mission. We don't transmit till we're over the target. You know, your dad and I were on a photo recon when he went down. I know. I read the mission debrief. How the hell did you get that? Freedom of Information Act. Lawyers. One minute to target. Go tactical. Roger that. Activating ATARS. Here we go. You with me, Lieutenant? To hell and back, sir. Lobo. Go high. Radio Seahawk. SAM sites are ringed with Shilkas. Have them re-arm the Hornets with Rockeyes and let the intruders drop the heavy stuff. Roger that. Is that what it was like over Hanoi? When we go back through, they'll be ready for us. That'll be like Hanoi. Seahawk. Lobo. SAM sites protected by Shilkas. Re-arm the Hornets with Rockeyes. Keep the A-6s heavy. Repeat. Re-arm the Hornets with Rockeyes. CAG's making a second run. You got her. You got her, Hammer. Steady. Steady.  Holding steady. Oh... Right engine, right engine. On my right. Pull off. Circuit breaker's out. Left throttle full! Go out, go out. Come on, baby! Go out. Ahh... You painting them, Buster? Bearing 1-5-0 and heading this way. At your 11. Angels 10. CAG's hit. We've lost an engine. I'm coming up. It's like riding a jackhammer! I gotta slow down. Stick with me. Like a fly on pie. I can see the CAG. He's not moving! How do I transmit ATARS? You can't from the back seat. Seahawk says they are receiving ATARS! Harm, Lobo. The CAG's alive! He activated the ATARS transmitter. I can't tell anything from back here. He's not moving. 15 miles, Harm. You've got to get ready. You'd better run the checklist with me. It's a long time since I trapped. You can't trap. I'm not punching out. You've got to. Once is enough. Negative on the trap. Once all birds are launched, we'll have you eject near the ship. The CAG is unconscious. He'd never survive an ejection. How long since you've made a trap? Any trap? Five years and it was ramp strike. I'm due a good one. Well, the CAG'll have to take his chances in the water. I- I- My radio's... You're breaking up, Seahawk. And I can't read you! The skipper's on the horn, boss. Stand by, Harm. Yes, sir? Let him trap. Aye, aye, sir. Bring it home, Harm. Coming home. I figure the only chance you've got is to follow me in. I'll set you into the slot. No offence, Lobo, but you've got the worst trap record on the ship. It's better than yours. I've been searching the ship for you, ma'am! Lieutenant Lubin, wants you in crypto on the double! Why? I don't know. He just said on the double! I found her, sir. What's going on? I've got a call for you on the discreet channel. Press the green button. Lieutenant Pike. Kate? Harm, what's happening? No time to explain. Just listen. Cassie is Lobo. No, Angela was Lobo. No, Angela was wearing Cassie's jacket when she went over the side. In the rain and the dark, she was mistaken for Cassie. Ripper. Has to be. Kate, he's gotta know we're gonna put this together and the last thing I need tonight is a wave-off. You're flying? You really know how to build a guy's confidence, Kate. I'll handle it. I'm counting on that. Harm? Do you have a pistol? A pistol? What do you need a pistol for? Never mind. Just stick to my six. The last delta strike's away. Prepare deck for emergency landing. Lobo. Try to take the break. Gear down. Flaps down. Automatic throttle engaged. Hook down? Hook down. He hasn't made a trap in five years! With luck, he'll take her with him! Lieutenant Carter! You are relieved of duty and confined to quarters pending the convening of a board of inquiry into Lieutenant Arutti's death. By whose orders? Mine! Under Article 118 of the Uniform Code Of Military Justice. Get this bitch off my platform before I throw her off! Sergeant! And it's Lieutenant Pike, not bitch. Clear?! I'm throttling back. Looking for 150 knots. How's he doing, Buster? I wouldn't ride with him. And I ride with you. Looking good, Harm. 1-1-6. Tomcat. Ball. Roger. Ball. It's all yours, Harm. Good luck. You're a little low. A little low. You are below the glide path. Pick it up! Pick it up! Power! Power! Power! Haven't you people ever seen a night trap? He's breathing. That makes one of us. Wherever he is, your old man'd be proud of you, sir. Sir. Permission to enter, sir? Granted. How are you feeling, sir? How would you feel with a cracked head? Heh. (Sigh) (Clearing throat) Skipper said you wanted to see me. Look, before this gets embarrassing for both of us, you don't have to thank me. Thank you for what? You're a naval aviator. I damn well expected you to get us back. Yes, sir. I wanted to... tell you something about your dad's last mission. When Hammer went down... I called the sandies and flew CAP till I was bingo fuel. He was okay when I left, but... he was gone when the sandies got there five minutes later. You were bingo fuel, sir. You had to leave. He was my friend. I know, sir. I caught tailwind on the way back. I got to the Ti with 800 pounds of fuel in my tanks. I could have stayed over Hammer, another... three, four minutes. It might have made the difference. A lot of things might have made a difference, sir. He might have been luckier. Or he might have never been there at all. You have nothing to apologise for, CAG. I didn't say I was apologising. I made a judgement call. I've had to live with that. Your eyes, are not a judgement call, son. You have nothing to second-guess. Thank you, sir. Now get the hell out of here. Go sue someone. Aye, aye, sir. The most unlikely hero of last night's highly successful naval air strike was Lieutenant Harmon Rabb Jr, Yes. who saved Captain Thomas Boone's life, when he safely landed this damaged Tomcat, onto the deck of the Seahawk. What is so unusual is that Lieutenant Rabb, isn't even an active pilot in the Navy. He's a member of the Judge Advocate General Corps. He's a lawyer. Hahahaha. That was Chuck DePalma reporting... Did you'd ever think you'd see the day, when a lawyer was a hero in America, Teddy? No, sir. I think you should take a look at this, Admiral. It's from Lieutenant Rabb. So she was murdered? Yes, sir. That's too bad. Well, You can't have everything. Excuse me, sir, but aren't you concerned about a Senate hearing? I mean, you said it could discredit our JAG investigation and ruin Lieutenant Rabb's career. They wouldn't dare go after him now. He's a hero. Nope, if anybody goes from JAG, it'll be me. Or you, Teddy. he he he he he he. It's been an honour serving with you, sir, ma'am. Thank you, Ensign. Oh... You're quite welcome. Oh, God. Here we go. You're out of uniform, Harm. I've got a board of inquiry in Naples in an hour, Mace. That's not what I mean. Thanks, Mace. You sure you won't be needing me in Naples. Let's go, Kate. Right flap. Check. Left flap. Check. This is humiliating, Harm. Launching from the back seat. Look at it this way, Cassie. You'll land without a wave-off. Here. You know what they say about gold wings and a white uniform.
