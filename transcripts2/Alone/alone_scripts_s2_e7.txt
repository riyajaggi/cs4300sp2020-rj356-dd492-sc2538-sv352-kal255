 [dramatic music] * - Look at that. That's a gigantic  plastic container. I'm thinking of making a boat, you know, tying some outriggers  to it to help stabilize it. Holy moley. - What am I doing out here? I'm set up to be here  for a long time. You could have the best life  in the world, but if you're alone,  then what's the point?

 - I needed to go for broke, and find a good location,  and live out here. Oh, my God. I just need to hurry up  and set up a shelter. [bleep]. Just a inch too short. Damn it! - Who are you when everything's  been stripped away? [bleep]. - [yelping] - It's scary out here in these woods. - I have not had  a serious meal in a week. - If I can't get a fire, then I can't stay here. - It's always in the back  of your mind, "Well, I could tap out."

 - Putting up  with this filming [bleep]? - Running into a predator,  it's not an if. It's a when. Get the hell out of here. I see you. Get out of here! - I'm living  a hand-to-mouth existence. Yes! Ah! - $500,000  is a lot of money. - It's just gonna keep  getting harder. - It's not the world  that needs to change. It's me  that needs to change. - [moans] * * - [sighs] This is [bleep] ridiculous. * I just woke up to my sleeping bag being soaked through, and I was like, "Well, that doesn't make any sense," and this is all water right here where I was sleeping, and it looks like it's ground water. I guess it seeped through. * Luckily, my backpack didn't get soaked... * But... * Just to give you an indicator, that's my fire hole. It is 100% full of water. * I have no-- [sniffles] I have no idea how that even happens. I don't even know what I'm gonna do. Um... * I--I mean, there's no way that I can stay in here. * It's [bleep] ridiculous. * [exhales] * - [exhales] I'm not mic'd up yet. It's morning. You know, I figure, I might as well film this. This is me trying to get up... after not eating a bite of food in four days. I... this has been going on for about 20 minutes. [laughing] I'm just sitting here on the bed, you know? I've got one sock on. Got a sock on. That's--that's a-- that's progress. I found the socks. Got a sock on. Yep. Means I'm headed out the door. * Now I've gotta put the other sock on. * It is really hard to not allow the extreme hunger  to affect my emotional state. I am here cold, hungry,  and alone. I've got to get creatures that live out there into here. End of discussion. * I haven't been able to fish  these waters in close to a week or so. Where my fishing hole was,  I can see waves just bam, just crashing against it. There's no way  I can get anything to eat out of the ocean. It's just too rough. It would be really great if I could get a hook in the water and get some fish, but it-- they're not gonna be here. If I was a fish, I would not hang out in that washing machine, getting banged against rocks  and things. The ocean  just has to calm down more before I'll be able to fish. * Not very happy about it. If you have experience  in the bush, it makes you humble. You might swagger  into the bush, but you're gonna stagger  out of the bush, you know, and eventually you're gonna  get your head handed to you. Eventually,  you're gonna get beaten. Eventually,  you're gonna fail out there and have to leave because this is too much. * [tense music] * - So my sleeping bag's soaked. * Ugh, this just sucks. It really, really sucks. So it comes a point of, well, what am I doing? Am I staying out here  just to stay out here? [dramatic music] Am I accomplishing anything? What's the point? I'm at a low right now.  [sighs] * If there was a time that I wanted to hang I it up, it's right now. I mean, there's standing water... * In my shelter. * First problem is, uh, sleeping bag  is soaking wet, so we're gonna address that by laying in it... [sighs] in my cook camp and hopefully my body heat combined with the heat  from this, uh, fire will slowly  alleviate the problem. Yeah, this is, uh, this is not fun at all. * My brain has been trying  to convince me... * Of quitting, so... not only do I have  to fight the elements, and...the water table...  [scoffs] * On top of that, I gotta fight my own damn mind trying to tell me  that it's okay to quit. * [dramatic music] * - So... you know, what I thought about when I woke up this morning? * I didn't have to wake up at 4:00 in the morning * * I didn't have to wake up at 4:00 in the morning * * I could get up whenever I want * * I can get up whenever I want Hey. That's what I thought this morning. * Emotionally, I'm doing good. This new place  just has all the resources. It's got tidal wash, and it looks like it's got  some good fishing spots, and it's got open areas. I'm finding chantarelles  everywhere. * [chuckles] Look at the size of this one. Some of this is rotten, but I can scrape that off, and I can still see there's some white meat inside there. I mean, it's on it's last legs, but I can eat some of this for sure. That's a big one. * Look at this stream. Isn't this beautiful? Huh? It's awesome. It's all hard work, and I won't be happy until I start bringing in fish, but once I start bringing in some fish, man, this place is gonna be gold. * I've got my line set up,  so I'm gonna go down and check out what's going on  down by the seashore. This move is  a complete game changer so long as I can find food  from the ocean, but if I don't catch a fish  on those lines, I might not be able to  survive here in this location. * Well, I can basically see both of my sets right now, both of my fishing sets, and I'm really intrigued to see if I got anything. * I really hope to catch some fish here, man. * One's got a shell on it. Two of 'em are stripped clean. * Third one's stripped clean. Dang. No fish for me. * That really sucks. * I'm starting to get worried that there's no fish  in this area. So I got my mushrooms. I want to go harvest  some limpets; I'll set those aside  for dinner. * Well, I've got my  sparse little dinner cooking. I think it's getting close  to boiling. I tried out  this new fireplace here. * I made a hole through the top of this stump and I would think that it should draw through the top... * and I don't need a huge fire. * Too huge a one and I'll catch my stump on fire. * I gotta say,  I'm a little bit frustrated with the fishing here. The other place,  I think I caught fish on every set that I put out  just about. Oh, my gosh, this is, like, the smallest meal I've ever eaten in my life. It's certainly a lot more uplifting and nice here, but I don't know what I'm gonna  do about fishing. * [water splashing] * I can't believe that  I did that. I think I'm up  for dumbass of the year award. I woke up, and the whole side of my shelter was glowing red. and for a split second I thought, "That's a hell of a fire," and then another split second I thought, "There shouldn't be  a hell of a fire," and I turned around and looked, and my stump looked like  a damn Roman candle with sparks flying out. The whole thing  was basically engulfed. I had my fire, like, right here, and it traveled down-- made a huge hole, * and traveled all the way down inside there. This whole trunk has burned out. * Look at that son of a bitch still smoke. * Unbelievable. * If I keep  making these mistakes, I don't know  what's gonna happen. * - Hmm, so growing a gray beard. * Man, I'm starting to look like  an old fart. [chuckles] * Another day of boat building. Making some good progress. I can't wait to see her in the water. It'll still be a-- a little while, a few days, but I-I sure hope to be able to have her in the water soon an--an--and, uh, in time to... get to that salmon run, like I said before. Finished both gunwales. I'm hoping to start  putting in the ribs today. * The cedar branch, it has a natural curve to it. I have hopes for this material to be the ribs. Let's see what cedar can do. I'll just whittle it as fine as I think is safe to do. * I have to make every single piece that goes in there by hand. I'll refine it if it doesn't break, and then comes the real chore, which is bending the ribs. I'm gonna put a bit of water where the bends gonna be, especially the outside. * We'll see if I can steam bend it or basically hot-fire bend it. I'm gonna play around with that a little bit. * Here we go. One big honking splinter here, but it'll do. First rib. * Let's hope it fits into its place properly. Actually should have tried the fit before. [grunts] There goes one. * 12 more to go. * This one here, nice, but this one here was a complicated one, and it came out perfect. There's no visible splintering on the outside, and that's a full bend. Matter of fact, it's past full, so this is probably the strongest testimony to how well this method works. I'm making a huge investment  in time and energy. Taking a huge gamble to  build a boat to fish offshore. Fishing from a boat  out on the water, I think, is gonna be  much more productive. I hope.  It would suck if it didn't, but that's--that, you know,  that's the gamble right there. * Almost finished. Have to tie on those ribs now. What I learned was building  western Greenland kayaks, so I'm applying that technology  here as much as I can, but everything there is  lashed and pegged. There's no screws, no nails. They didn't have any.  They didn't need any. * So the ribs are fit in. [sniffles] Um, quite a bit of wonkiness here and there, but at least something that resembles a boat is under way. * * I've got a limpet. Limpets-- part of a complete breakfast. Actually, limpet--it's the only thing I have for breakfast. [dramatic music] * If I ever see these on a menu, I'm ordering two dozen of 'em just to have the luxury of eating that many of 'em in one sitting. * The only thing  that's bothering me right now is the starvation that just can't  get enough to eat. Don't get me wrong, there's  a lot of limpets out there, but there's not a lot of food  on a limpet. I need to get some big protein,  big fish. * I've got to finish my net. * It's looking like a net. None of the lines lay flat. It's all kind of disorganized,  a little bit, which is kind of what you need  for tangling a fish. You want the net  to be able to catch them, and you want 'em  to get in there and get stuck and try to turn around  and get out of it, and thrash about. I mean,  I like the way it looks. Oh, fog, fog, fog. Is that on the outside? [sniffles] No, you see that's internal, and that's-- I got one minute left anyway on the battery. Well, that's great. * That's the part that doesn't  get in the episodes. We see all the footage  that we're shooting and stuff, but the real burden  of being out here is this other full-time job  I have of being a cameraman. * I'm out here surviving  and trying to work, and do all the things  I need to do, and I'm a cameraman. * I'm gonna mount  my home made gill net as an extension on this gill net... * And we'll see how it goes. You know, I don't know if this'll work. It's much more visible than the other one, but the other one hasn't caught anything yet, so it can't work worse than that. Right? * Just trying to figure out  what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life  after this. I do--I don't know. You know,  it would be great if I had a career to go back to. [soft music] There's gotta be something  out there for me. * All right, that is a bottle of crushed mussels hanging on a gill net, and if that doesn't attract fish to the net, I don't know what else to do in this bay. Seriously... I'm kind of, like, at my wits end. If this idea doesn't work, I'm--I'm drawing a blank. [sighs] And it's gotta catch something. * [dramatic music] * - All right, I've decided to quit moping around like a little baby, and... * Get some stuff done. [exhales] I have to stay  because I feel like I need to set an example  for veterans to-- to just not give up, you know? To--to keep going,  you know, even though it sucks, and even though  you want the pain and everything else to go away, you know, just keep going. * All right, so the net is not catching fish anymore. It only caught one  weird looking fish that I think just  flew the wrong way. I have officially outworn my welcome sleeping on the ground. [soft music] Since my net isn't doing really anything as far as catching fish, we're gonna turn it back into a hammock. You constantly have to change  your approach to things, you know, 'cause just when you  think something is going good, it could change and go bad, and then you gotta figure out  something else to do. Stuff happens.  You're gonna have those things that just kick you  while you're down, and you gotta get up and say,  "Well, I got stuff to do." [dramatic music] Just really spent a lot of time  building that shelter, now it's flooded, but I don't have the energy to--to rebuild that thing somewhere else. Especially without food, the calories and all that. That's just not gonna work. You know, I barely have  the energy to split wood. All right, so it's still soaked in here. Smells like [bleep] seaweed... Bad. Like, really bad. If you allow yourself to adapt and you allow yourself  to--to change, then you're capable  of just amazing things. [soft music] That might just work. * Other than the foul stench of seaweed. [tense music] * - Well, good morning. Day 21. I'm thankful  for this beautiful place. I'm enjoying myself being here. It's--it's brought out the best in me. I've built a very beautiful camp. I have a comfortable home here. I can spend hours  in my shelter... * And I've got means and ways  for getting food... * And I've got things  to occupy my time and my mind. I cut dice. Two blocks. Kind of round off the corners, so they roll better for my football game. Sunday night football. We have our two opposing teams, the scallops and the stones. The dice determine yardage and distance. Yes, it's a pass. Greater than ten yards? No, all right, so, let's roll to see how many yards we get, and we just got two that time. All right, second down. The defense is holding. You know,  the projects keep me busy throughout the day, and so time just flies by  because of that. I did get the arapuca  live box trap made. Hopping along... then he is caught. The other day,  I found that black buoy. The perfect size  for a bowling ball. * Boom, and I got the top one, no problem. Like it when the--  the time flies, but... I'm beginning  to feel guilty of wasting time and space that could be used  in a better way, and I feel like my journey is becoming selfish  and self-serving. * I'm not growing more and I'm not discovering  new things about myself. * And after thinking about it, praying about it... I don't know  how much longer I can do this. * [dramatic music] * - I woke up, uh, craving... [rain pelting] Cinnamon sugar donuts and hot apple cider. Mmm. Fall. * Still missing home a lot today. * Over these last couple of days,  I wanted to go home. * I'm just having second thoughts  about it. You also have the expectations  of other people. My family's gonna be  watching this. You don't want  to let anybody down. So it's a tough one, you know? It's really hard being alone. I've never been alone  for this long before. * I have to figure out  how long I want to stay here. * So today I'm just gonna build a little sweat lodge. A sweat lodge is  one of those things, like, that feeds you  more spiritually. Just do a couple of rounds and, you know, have a dip in the ocean and get myself clean both physically and spiritually before making the decision. Biggest question I have is  just: What am I doing this for? * [axe thumping] I have all of these cedar branches, and then there's, like, a little circle you can kind of see. It's pretty small. I don't know what the diameter is. Maybe, like, six feet or something. It's just for me, so it doesn't need to be crazy big. * Think I got eight saplings, and then I just dug 'em  into the ground and folded 'em over, so that way they all  are connected at the top, and then you just  tie them together. * So after those rocks have been heated, those'll go into that pit... * And then pour water on top. * So now I'm gonna  put the tarp over it. * Super simple. * It looks good, actually. * I got all the rocks in there. I'll get the rocks, like, just super hot. * Put 'em into the lodge and then pour water on them, and then sweat it out. [soft music] Maybe this will  provide some insight. * Oh, yes. Mm. * Oh, uh-huh. * There's a certain level of content-ness and exhaustion that comes from doing a good hot sweat. It's like you are happy doing nothing. * [steam hisses] Mm. [steam hisses] [sighs] [steam hisses] [singing in foreign language] * [soft dramatic] A lot of things  to look forward to. Today's been a good day. I'm really grateful  to be here... * And to be in this place  that's so beautiful. It's seriously an incredible, powerful place. * * My head was kind of  out of it a bit this morning, and I feel, actually,  pretty good right now. I feel really grounded. * It's all a mental game,  you know? It's just about,  like, pushing on and--and adapting yourself  to the situation. A lot of staying calm  for me is just, like, looking around and being  grateful for what I have. * Every day I've been able  to walk outside and see something beautiful. * I've come to my decision. * [dramatic music] * - It's not about:  "How long can I last?" "How far  can you push yourself?" "How much can you  test your limits?" It's not really about that. - I'm in a quandary;  I don't know what to do, and I'm just gonna go ahead  and say it, I don't know if I can do this. - The last two days have been  mentally pretty rough. You know, just going  back and forth in my head if it would be okay to quit. I don't have to do this. * - There's not enough  caloric intake in the meals that  I can pull out of the ocean to keep me from  eventually starving to death. That's the endgame for me. * I know my goal all along was to stay out here  for the entire year, but I just miss Barbara  terribly. * Being away like this, so long, I'm afraid that  it'll mess me up so bad that I'll go home this thing  that Barbara doesn't know. * I have to admit that I did not foresee the heartache that I'm feeling. Love that camp. That's saying good-bye to a really good friend right there. * I do not like saying good-bye. * It feels like abandonment. * Man, oh, man, that is--that is something. It's even more beautiful from here. * * - Tomorrow, day 22, uh, I'm gonna climb up-- climb up this mountain behind me. Um... [soft dramatic music] In, uh--in remembrance of the 22 veterans a day that are committing suicide  in this country. So hopefully, you know, somebody sees it and is--is inspired to--to keep fighting, to keep going. Um, so that's my hope. That's my goal in what I'm doing tomorrow. * Today I have  a lot of prep work to do. Getting the camera gear ready  and food and you have to boil water, which is huge because that gives you  the ability to--to purify it enough so I can get to the top  of that mountain. * If I can climb this mountain  on day 22, then I can do whatever. * I think it's gonna  recharge my batteries. Gonna give me a little bit of--  of extra motivation... * To go a little bit further. * Water takes forever to boil here. It's been about an hour--  the last hour boiling this water. It's just such a--a pain  in the ass. * It's starting to rain... * A little bit, so I'm gonna pull this inside here. * [bleep] You gotta be kidding me. Oh, my God, man. [exhales] Wound up spilling a majority of my [bleep] water. [dramatic music] * It was right there. Right at a boil. * And now I don't even know if I'll have enough to fill up my water bottles. * Mother[bleep]. * - You know, I was, like, so at peace with my decision, but I don't know. Gone back and forth on it. [soft dramatic music] Before I came out here,  you know, I was in the process of--of choosing whether  or not I wanted to do this. I decided not to. * Called my dad up,  "What do you think?" And he had a really good  perspective, you know? Said this was a sort of, like, once in a lifetime opportunity to do something like this, and to just remember, like, how big this is. * I'm torn between living here  and going home. * If I leave, I'd be doing myself  an injustice. If I stay longer, I'm gonna be alone. * * * [satellite phone beeps] - Hey, Dan, this is Randy. * - Hey, man, uh, I, uh--I wanted to call because I'm ready to go. I'm--I'm tapping out. * * Physically, I felt capable  of staying out here a really long time, but we're not just  physical bodies, and so I wasn't  being fed mentally. I wasn't being fed emotionally because there's no interaction  with other people. I mean, don't get me wrong,  like, I love living this way. I want to live off the land. * That's the ideal life for me, but there's no way  I could do it alone. I am craving human companionship  like it's water. * I wanted to just come out here and just sort of, like,  connect with the land... * And I wanted it  to teach me things, and... you know, it really made me  appreciate my loved ones. My sort of,  like, community and tribe. I mean, it--  it really opened my eyes to how amazing  the people in my life are... but I'm really gonna  miss this place a lot. * I'm just craving my loved ones, and, you know, I just--I way underestimated that being the hardest part. * * - Hi, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [soft dramatic music] My name is Justin, and I'm reporting to you live from the scene of the set of the movie "Waterworld." Everything is under water. Holy [bleep]. There's about--oh, man, at least six inches under water. [sighs] I thought I had it bad earlier. This is nuts. I have no frickin' idea what I'm gonna do as far as shelter... [dramatic music] But you know what? Today, that doesn't matter... * Because today is day 22. I decided that on day 22 I was gonna climb a mountain. * Kind of-- kind of really at my--at the bottom of my rope right now, and, uh... so I need this. I need--I need to get to the top of that mountain. Um... * 'Cause when I come back down, I gotta start all over. * Um... * So... [exhales] This is it. * There's a lot  of ups and downs in life, and for every  one step you take, there's three things  that pull you back down. Over the course of time,  that can drain on you. Drain your soul. Drain a person down to where  they don't want to do anything. They don't want to-- to deal with life anymore. If one veteran that's hurting  sees this and says, "I can keep going," that, "It can get better," and, "That it will get better "if you keep putting one foot  in front of the other and you keep climbing," then it's worth the risk. * - I'm ready to put the skin  on the kayak. The tarp I have, one good scratch  on those barnacles, and it's done with. - I'm gonna climb  this damn mountain. This is extremely dangerous. One wrong move here, and I'm done. [grunts] - Rough surf came in, destroyed both of my gill nets. I'm wasting away in here. If I don't get some solid food out of that ocean,  I'm not gonna make it. - There is a bear behind me. It is at my net. What's it gonna do? [whispering] Oh, it's coming my way. Oh, my God. *
