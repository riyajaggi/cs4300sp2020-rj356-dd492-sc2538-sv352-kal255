 OCTOBER 1962. DURING WHAT WILL BECOME KNOWN AS THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, EVERYONE HOLDS THEIR BREATH. IT WAS THE MOST FRIGHTENING MOMENT OF THE ENTIRE 45 YEARS OF THE COLD WAR. TWO GLOBAL SUPERPOWERS APPEAR READY TO BRING THE WORLD TO THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR. BUT UNDER THE SEA SURFACE, A DIFFERENT NUCLEAR BATTLE IS BREWING. AND NO ONE REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHERE THE REAL THREAT COMES FROM.

 THROUGH THE 20th CENTURY, A SUBSEA WEAPON ALLOWS WARRIORS TO FIGHT FROM BENEATH THE WAVES. WITH CUNNING, FORCE, AND TENACITY, THEIR ENEMIES STRIKE BACK. REVOLUTIONARY, BUT STILL SOMETIMES PRIMITIVE, IT'S A DESPERATE BID... TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WAR. THEIR STORIES ARE LEGEND. OCTOBER 1962. A SOVIET SUBMARINE RACES TOWARDS CUBA ON A TOP-SECRET MISSION. B- 59 HAS JUST LEFT A RUSSIAN PORT NEAR MURMANSK, AND NOW CROSSES THE BARENTS SEA. RADIO AND RADAR TECHS SCAN FOR ENEMY SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT.

 THEY ARE APPROACHING THE NORDKAPP LINE. NAMED AFTER THE NORTHERNMOST POINT OF MAINLAND EUROPE, IT IS A NATO ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE BARRIER WHICH RUNS FROM BEAR ISLAND TO NORDKAPP, NORWAY. SOVIET CAPTAIN 2nd RANK VALENTIN SAVITSKY... MUST GET HIS CREW THROUGH THE LINE UNDETECTED. IF HE IS LOCATED, NATO WILL TRY TO TRACK B-59'S EVERY MOVE AND PUT THREE OTHER SUBMARINES, B-4, B-36 AND B-130, AT RISK. EVEN WORSE, IT COULD TIP OFF THE AMERICANS ABOUT OPERATION ANADYR- A MASSIVE SOVIET CAMPAIGN TO MOVE TROOPS, MILITARY EQUIPMENT, AND MISSILES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC TO CUBA. MONTHS OF SECRET MOBILIZATION THAT ULTIMATELY TRIGGERS THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS. IT WILL BRING THE WORLD THE CLOSEST IT HAS EVER COME TO GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR. BUT THE SITUATION IN CUBA IS COMPLICATED, AS THE ISLAND NATION'S CONFLICT WITH THE UNITED STATES HEATS UP. JUST THREE YEARS BEFORE, IN 1959, FIDEL CASTRO OVERTHROWS THE PREVIOUSLY U. S.- BACKED GOVERNMENT IN HAVANA. IN RESPONSE, PRESIDENT KENNEDY AUTHORIZES CIA-TRAINED EXILES FROM CUBA TO INVADE THEIR HOMELAND. CASTRO FIGHTS BACK VIGOROUSLY. THE BAY OF PIGS INVASION IS A DISASTER FOR THE AMERICANS. WHILE HE WINS THAT ROUND, CASTRO IS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER U. S. INVASION IS INEVITABLE. SUDDENLY KHRUSHCHEV, HEAD OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT, REALIZED HE HAD AN OPENING, AND HE WAS GOING TO EXPLOIT IT. CASTRO ENTERS SECRET TALKS WITH NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV, WHO PROPOSES A SERIES OF MISSILE SITES AS AN OFFER OF SOVIET PROTECTION FOR THEIR COMMUNIST ALLY. CUBA WILL BE HOME TO DOZENS OF NUCLEAR MISSILES EASILY WITHIN RANGE OF ALL OF THE U. S. MAINLAND... A DANGEROUS PROVOCATION IN THE CHESS GAME OF THE COLD WAR. FROM THE SOVIET PERSPECTIVE, WE SEE KHRUSHCHEV WANTING TO PUT MISSILES INTO CUBA THAT COMPENSATE FOR THE MISSILES THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS PLACED IN GREAT BRITAIN AND ITALY AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING INTO TURKEY, COUPLED WITH OUR BOMBER BASES AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH HAD NUCLEAR STRIKE AIRCRAFT ON THEM. CASTRO AGREES TO THE PLAN. AFTER APRIL 1962, THE SOVIETS START TO TRANSPORT SOME 40,000 TROOPS, ARTILLERY, AND MISSILES. THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES THE CREATION OF A SUBMARINE BASE. THE INITIAL PLAN WAS THAT THE SUBMARINES WOULD GO OPENLY TO CUBA AND THEY WOULD JOIN THE GROUP OF SOVIET FORCES, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BIGGEST GROUP OF SOVIET FORCES OUTSIDE OF THE SOVIET UNION. BUT THE PLANS CHANGE IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE SUBMARINES' DEPARTURE. ACCORDING TO HIS FINAL ORDERS, SAVITSKY MUST NOW GET B-59 THROUGH WITHOUT BEING DETECTED. EVEN WORSE, HE MUST DO SO IN RECORD TIME. THE ORDERS THAT WERE FINALLY GIVEN TO THE COMMANDERS ASSUMED THE SPEED OF THE TRAVEL AND THE SECRECY OF THE TRAVEL, WHICH WERE PRACTICALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER. TO MEET MOSCOW'S DEADLINE, SAVITSKY AND THE OTHER SUBMARINE CAPTAINS MUST TRAVEL OVER 10 KNOTS AT ALL TIMES. BUT THIS WILL STRAIN THEIR PROJECT 641 SUBMARINES- ALSO KNOWN BY THEIR NATO CLASSIFICATION, FOXTROT. THE SOVIET PROJECT 641 WAS A DIESEL ELECTRIC SUBMARINE MODELED IN PART ON THE GERMAN TYPE 21 OF WORLD WAR II. THESE SUBS USE DIESEL ENGINES WHILE RUNNING ON THE SURFACE AND BATTERY-POWERED MOTORS WHEN THEY SUBMERGE. THE BATTERIES LAST FOR ONLY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME BEFORE THEY NEED TO BE RECHARGED ON OR NEAR THE SURFACE. FOXTROTS INCORPORATE THE BEST OF EARLIER U-BOAT TECHNOLOGY- THE SNORKEL. WHEN THEIR BATTERIES, WHICH RAN THEM WHEN THEY WERE SUBMERGED, STARTED TO RUN LOW, YOU STUCK UP A BREATHING PIPE CALLED A SNORKEL, BROUGHT IN FRESH AIR FOR THE ENGINES. BUT TRAVELING SUBMERGED, EVEN WITH A SNORKEL, REDUCES SPEED. THAT LIMITS THE SPEED TO ABOUT 10 KNOTS- 12, 13 MILES AN HOUR. AND IT JUST TAKES A LONG TIME. THE SOVIET CAPTAINS BELIEVE THAT BRITISH AND NORWEGIAN FORCES HAVE DETECTED THE SUBMARINES. IF THEY PINPOINT THE SUBS' EXACT LOCATION, NATO CAN BLOW THEIR COVER AND REVEAL THEIR COURSE TO CUBA. FORCED TO TRAVEL CLOSE TO THE SURFACE TO USE THEIR SNORKEL, THERE IS NOWHERE FOR B-59 TO HIDE. BUT THEY MAY HAVE AN OPTION TO GIVE THEM THE EDGE- THEIR RADIO INTERCEPT GROUP. WITH STRONG ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS, THE RADIO INTERCEPT GROUP MONITORS ALL OPEN FREQUENCIES FOR RELEVANT INFORMATION. SAVITSKY WAS SKEPTICAL WHEN THE GROUP IS FIRST ASSIGNED TO THE SUBMARINE, JUST DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE. INITIALLY, THEY WERE GREETED WITH SUSPICION, PARTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SUBMARINERS. THEY WERE SEEN AS KGB, THEY WERE SEEN AS OUTSIDERS. THE SUBMARINERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY NEEDED THEM, BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT A STANDARD UNIT ON A SUB. IN THIS PERIOD, MUCH COMMUNICATION IS CARRIED ON OPEN SHORT WAVE FREQUENCIES. B- 59'S RADIO INTERCEPT GROUP WORKS FURIOUSLY TO MAP OUT NATO VESSELS IN THE AREA. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY LISTEN TO LEARN IF THE PRESENCE OF SOVIET SUBMARINES HAS BEEN DETECTED. B- 59 CLOSES IN ON THE NORDKAPP LINE. AS THEY REACH IT, THERE'S NO SIGN OF NATO FORCES. B- 59 HAS BEATEN THEM. THE SOVIET CAPTAINS BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE NATO FORCES EXPECTED FOXTROT SUBMARINES TO TRAVEL AT THEIR USUAL, SLOWER SPEED, UNAWARE OF MOSCOW'S AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE. ALL FOUR SOVIET SUBMARINES CROSS THE NORDKAPP LINE INTO THE NORWEGIAN SEA. BUT THE NORDKAPP LINE IS ONLY THE FIRST CHALLENGE THEY FACE. EVEN AS THEY CROSS THIS ONE, THEY MUST BREAK THROUGH ANOTHER NATO ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE LINE TO GET TO CUBA. AND SAVITSKY HAS MORE THAN NATO TO WORRY ABOUT. HE IS BEING WATCHED FROM WITHIN HIS OWN SUBMARINE. B- 59 ALSO CARRIES CAPTAIN 2nd RANK VASILY ARKHIPOV. VASILY ARKHIPOV IS THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE BRIGADE, AND IN HIS RANK, HE IS THE SAME RANK AS THE COMMANDER OF THE SUBMARINE, SAVITSKY. THE INFORMAL RULES ON THE SUBS WERE THAT THE COMMANDER OF THE SUBMARINE IS IN CHARGE OF MAKING DECISIONS, NO MATTER WHO ELSE IS ON THE SUBMARINE, BUT CERTAINLY THE FACT THAT ARKHIPOV IS ON THE SUBMARINE MAKES THE PRACTICE OF COMMANDING THE SUBMARINE MORE COMPLICATED, BECAUSE SAVITSKY WILL HAVE TO CONSULT WITH ARKHIPOV ON ALL THE MAJOR DECISIONS THAT HE'S MAKING. THE CREW ALSO INCLUDES A POLITICAL OFFICER NAMED IVAN MASLENNIKOV. HIS JOB IS TO REPORT ANYTHING "UN-SOVIET" SAVITSKY DOES BACK TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN THE USSR. FEW SOVIET CAPTAINS HAVE EVER CROSSED THESE 5,000 MILES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC. BALANCING BOTH POLITICAL AND MILITARY CONCERNS, THIS MISSION TO CUBA WILL PROVE TO BE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE OF SAVITSKY'S CAREER. OCTOBER 1962. AS THE COLD WAR HEATS UP, B- 59 AND THREE OTHER RUSSIAN SUBMARINES TRAVEL AS PART OF OPERATION ANADYR- THE SECRET SOVIET MOBILIZATION ON THE ISLAND OF CUBA. THE MOVEMENT OF FOUR SOVIET SUBS INTO THE ATLANTIC COULD TIP OFF THE AMERICANS. THEY MUST REMAIN UNDETECTED. THEY HAVE JUST CROSSED THE FIRST OF TWO NATO ANTI-SUBMARINE LINES. LIKE THE OTHER CAPTAINS, VALENTIN SAVITSKY IS UNDER PRESSURE TO COMPLETE THE JOURNEY IN RECORD TIME. NOW SAVITSKY APPROACHES THE SECOND NATO ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE LINE- THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-UK GAP. HIS ORDERS ARE CLEAR. THEY KNEW THEY HAD STRICT ORDERS NOT TO BE DISCOVERED, NOT TO BE SURFACED. IF A SUBMARINE IS DETECTED HERE, NATO CAN LAUNCH PATROL AIRCRAFT FROM BASES IN ICELAND AND SCOTLAND TO TRACK IT. THIS INCREASES THE RISK THE OTHER SUBS WILL BE PICKED UP, EXPOSING THE SCALE OF THE OPERATION AND ENDANGERING THE SOVIET PLANS FOR A NUCLEAR BASE IN CUBA. SAVITSKY WILL GO THROUGH THE ICELAND-FAEROES GAP TO THE EAST. DESPITE THE FISHING BOATS THAT FILL THE PASSAGE, HE SETS COURSE ON THE SURFACE TO MAKE BETTER TIME. SAVITSKY GIVES THE ORDER, AND B-59 SPEEDS UP TO 15 KNOTS. THE SUBMARINE DARTS ALONG AT HIGH SPEED, WEAVING IN AND OUT OF THE FISHING BOATS AS DISCRETELY AS IT CAN. MEANWHILE, THE RADIO INTERCEPT GROUP KEEPS TRACK OF AERIAL ACTIVITY OVERHEAD. THOSE COMMUNICATIONS WERE BOTH ON THE OPEN FREQUENCIES, AND THEY ALSO WERE ON... THEY WERE CODED COMMUNICATIONS THAT THEY COULD PICK UP BECAUSE OF THEIR EQUIPMENT. THEY EVEN LISTEN IN ON THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE FISHERMEN TO MAKE SURE NO ONE HAS SEEN THEM. THEY PASS THE SECOND NATO LINE UNDETECTED. ONCE INTO THE ATLANTIC, THE SOVIET SUBMARINES FIND THEMSELVES IN A RADIO COMMUNICATIONS VACUUM FROM MOSCOW. INTERFERENCE BLOCKS OUT NORTHERN FLEET RADIO STATIONS. FOR TWO DAYS, CREWS SEEK THE CLEAREST FREQUENCIES. FINALLY, THEY'RE ABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES THROUGH OCCASIONAL WINDOWS. BUT AS THEY GET FARTHER FROM HOME, THE WORSE THEIR RECEPTION IS GOING TO BE. THAT'S LIKELY TO BE A PROBLEM. THE AMERICANS HAVE JUST MADE THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF THE SOVIET BUILD-UP IN CUBA, AND IT'S SHOCKING. TOP-SECRET RECONNAISSANCE BY U-2 SPY PLANES HAS BROUGHT BACK DAMNING PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE. THEY CLEARLY SHOW LAUNCH SITES FOR MEDIUM-RANGE BALLISTIC NUCLEAR MISSILES UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THE CIA HAD A MONOPOLY ON THE U-2 PHOTOS. AND I SUSPECT THAT WAS THE BEST STUFF THEY EVER HAD. THE AMERICANS ARE STUNNED, AND THEIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE. UNKNOWN TO THE UNITED STATES, THE SOVIETS HAD LANDED 134 NUCLEAR WARHEADS AND BOMBS IN CUBA. A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE WERE FOR THE BALLISTIC MISSILES THAT COULD REACH THE UNITED STATES. TENSIONS RISE IN WASHINGTON, D. C., AS EVERYONE SCRAMBLES FOR MORE INFORMATION. B- 59 IS JUST ONE OF FOUR SOVIET SUBMARINES CARRYING MEN AND MATERIALS TO CUBA. AFTER EACH SOVIET SUB CROSSES THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-UK LINE AND APPROACHES NORTH AMERICA, THE RISK OF BEING DISCOVERED INCREASES. THEY CAN HIDE WITH SOME HELP FROM MOTHER NATURE, BUT IT COMES AT A COST. THEY WERE KIND OF HELPED BY A MAJOR STORM IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC. THE ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE UNITS ARE NOT AS ACTIVE. THEY SIMPLY CAN'T FLY IN THAT STORM. AS A RESULT, THEY WERE ABLE TO GET TO THE SPEED. SINCE THEY ARE PRETTY SURE THEY WON'T BE DISCOVERED, THE SUBMARINES TRAVEL ON THE SURFACE AND CAN MAKE BETTER TIME THAN WHEN USING THE SNORKEL. THEY WOULD GO UP 40-METER WAVES AND THEN ESSENTIALLY DIVE DOWN, AND SOMETIMES THE ANGLE OF THE SUBMARINE WOULD BE 40, 50 DEGREES, WHICH WAS VERY DANGEROUS. AND THEY SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW, YES, THE SUBMARINES COULD HAVE MALFUNCTION," BUT THEY DIDN'T, THEY WITHSTOOD THE STORM. THE SOVIET UNION DID HAVE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES THAT COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE STORM BY TRAVELING SUBMERGED, POWERED BY NUCLEAR REACTOR. BUT THERE WERE ISSUES. AT ONE POINT, THE SOVIET REGIME PLANNED TO SEND NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBMARINES TO CUBAN WATERS AND ACTUALLY BASE SOME OF THEM IN CUBA. HOWEVER, IN 1962, THEY WERE HAVING MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FIRST-GENERATION NUCLEAR SUBMARINES. CAPTAIN 2nd RANK VASILY ARKHIPOV, THE BRIGADE CHIEF OF STAFF ON BOARD B-59, HAD FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROBLEMS. HE SERVED ON SUBMARINE K-19 WHEN IT DEVELOPED A NUCLEAR REACTOR COOLANT LEAK. THE RADIOACTIVE CORE'S TEMPERATURE ROSE QUICKLY. THE CREW NEEDED TO REPAIR THE COOLING SYSTEM, OR THE CORE WOULD MELT THROUGH THE REACTOR AND SINK THE SUB. WITHOUT PROPER RADIATION EQUIPMENT, THEY USE WHAT THEY HAVE- GAS MASKS AND RAINCOATS. WHEN THE FIRST TEAM COMES OUT, THEY BEGIN TO VOMIT. THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO HIGH LEVELS OF RADIATION. THE SECOND GROUP KNOWS THEIR LIKELY FATE. EVEN SO, THEY CONTINUE THE REPAIRS. THE CREW JERRY-RIGS A COOLING SYSTEM WITH THE DRINKING WATER ON BOARD TO SAVE THE SUBMARINE. BUT EIGHT MEN DIE, AND EVERYONE ELSE GETS CONTAMINATED. IT IS SOMETHING VASILY ARKHIPOV WILL NEVER FORGET. NOW, IN OCTOBER 1962, ADDITIONAL RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHTS OVER CUBA HAVE REVEALED MORE MISSILE SITES. IN WASHINGTON, THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF PUSH FOR AN AIR STRIKE AGAINST CUBA. PRESIDENT KENNEDY DISAGREES. AN AIR STRIKE WOULD ESCALATE THE CONFLICT AND RISKS A NUCLEAR CONFRONTATION. JFK BASES HIS VIEWS ON HIS EXPERIENCE AS A WORLD WAR II OFFICER. HE DOESN'T VIEW NUCLEAR WAR AS A WAR THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE WON. AND HE REALLY VIEWS THIS AS A POLITICAL PROBLEM TO SOLVE. BUT HE ALSO WORRIES AMERICAN INACTION WILL ONLY EMBOLDEN KHRUSHCHEV. PRESIDENT KENNEDY WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE HIS NEXT STEPS VERY CAREFULLY. OCTOBER 1962. FOUR SOVIET SUBMARINE CREWS ARE EXHAUSTED. WHILE TRAVELING TO SET UP A SUBMARINE BASE IN CUBA, THEY'VE ENCOUNTERED THE REMNANTS OF A HURRICANE. SURVIVING THE STORM TAKES ITS TOLL AS THEY TRAVEL ON THE SURFACE TO MAKE BETTER TIME. CAPTAIN 2nd RANK VALENTIN SAVITSKY KNOWS THAT HIS JOB IS ABOUT TO GET EVEN TOUGHER. AS THEY SAIL, THEY BRING B-59 WITHIN RANGE OF AMERICAN SHORE-BASED FACILITIES AND LONG-RANGE PATROL AIRCRAFT. IN WASHINGTON, D. C., KENNEDY'S TEAM DEBATES THEIR OPTIONS. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW EMOTIONALLY CHARGED THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IS, MEETING WITH JFK IN HIS CABINET ROOM. THE PRIMARY ADVISOR IS HIS BROTHER, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. YOU'VE ALSO GOT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McNAMARA, YOU'VE GOT THE SECRETARY OF STATE, YOU'VE GOT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, ALL DEBATING AND ARGUING HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS. THE PRESIDENT'S BROTHER, ROBERT KENNEDY, IS BLUNT IN HIS ASSESSMENT. MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE THE FIFTH ONE, REALLY, WHICH IS THE INVASION. I WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE DROPPING BOMBS ALL OVER CUBA IF YOU DO THE SECOND, THE AIRPORTS, KNOCKING OUT THEIR PLANES, DROPPING IT ON ALL THEIR MISSILES, YOU'RE COVERING MOST OF CUBA. YOU'RE GOING TO KILL AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE, AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AN AWFUL LOT OF HEAT ON IT. IT BOILS DOWN TO TWO RISKY OPTIONS. JFK COULD EITHER INITIATE AN AIR STRIKE OR A BLOCKADE. IF HE EXECUTES AN AIR STRIKE, SURELY THE RUSSIANS WOULD RESPOND TO THAT. BUT EVEN A BLOCKADE IS STILL AN ACT OF WAR. BOTH OPTIONS COULD TRIGGER A LARGER CONFRONTATION. FOR THE KREMLIN, THE MISSILES IN CUBA ARE AN ACT OF SELF-DEFENSE. KHRUSHCHEV DOESN'T BELIEVE HE'S STARTING A NUCLEAR WAR. HE LOOKS AT JFK AS A RATIONAL INDIVIDUAL, AND THAT THIS IS A RATIONAL RESPONSE TO POSITIONING THE JUPITER MISSILES IN TURKEY. ON OCTOBER 22nd, PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY MAKES HIS FAMOUS ADDRESS TO THE NATION AND BEGINS WITH THE REVELATION OF THE MISSILE SITES. THE PURPOSE OF THESE BASES CAN BE NONE OTHER THAN TO PROVIDE A NUCLEAR STRIKE CAPABILITY AGAINST THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SEVERAL OF THEM INCLUDE MEDIUM-RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES, CAPABLE OF CARRYING A NUCLEAR WARHEAD FOR A DISTANCE OF MORE THAN 1,000 NAUTICAL MILES. EACH OF THESE MISSILES, IN SHORT, IS CAPABLE OF STRIKING WASHINGTON, D. C., THE PANAMA CANAL, CAPE CANAVERAL, MEXICO CITY, OR ANY OTHER CITY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES. IN THE SPEECH, HE LAYS BARE THE NORMS THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE CROSSED AND PROVIDES ENOUGH DETAIL TO PROVIDE A CALL OF ACTION FOR THE AMERICANS. I HAVE DIRECTED THAT THE FOLLOWING INITIAL STEPS BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY. KENNEDY THEN PROPOSES A QUARANTINE LINE, INSTEAD OF AN OUTRIGHT BLOCKADE, TO COME INTO EFFECT ON OCTOBER 24th. ALL SHIPS OF ANY KIND BOUND FOR CUBA, FROM WHATEVER NATION OR PORT, WILL, IF FOUND TO CONTAIN CARGOES OF OFFENSIVE WEAPONS, BE TURNED BACK. BY CALLING IT A QUARANTINE INSTEAD OF A BLOCKADE, JFK HAS SHIFTED THE FOCUS AWAY FROM THE MILITARY AND TOWARDS A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION. HE'S ALSO TRYING TO PROVIDE THE RUSSIANS A DE-ESCALATION OPPORTUNITY. BUT IN THE EVENT THAT FAILS, JFK ORDERS THE GREATEST EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION OF U. S. TROOPS SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR, TO PREPARE FOR A POSSIBLE INVASION OF CUBA. THE BRITISH CONSUL IN MIAMI DESCRIBES IT LIKE BEING IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND RIGHT BEFORE D-DAY. SOME 200 AMERICAN SHIPS TRAVEL TO POSITIONS ON THE QUARANTINE LINE- AN ARC STRETCHING OUT 500 MILES FROM CUBA. MEANWHILE, FOUR SOVIET FOXTROT SUBMARINES MAKE IT INTO THE WATERS OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES. THUS FAR, U. S. ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE, OR A. S. W. UNITS, HAVE NOT MOVED TO INTERCEPT THEM. BUT IT QUICKLY BECOMES APPARENT THEY MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT SUBMARINE FOR THE JOB. THE FOXTROTS, FIRST BUILT IN THE LATE '50s- EXCELLENT SUBMARINES. BUT THE PROBLEM- THESE SUBMARINES DESIGNED FOR ARCTIC WATERS. AND EVEN WITH THE SNORKEL BRINGING IN FRESH AIR, WHEN THEY RAN THEIR DIESEL ENGINES, GENERATING HEAT, PLUS THE INSULATION OF THESE SUBMARINES DESIGNED TO OPERATE IN ARCTIC WATERS... MISERABLE LIVING CONDITIONS. MISERABLE. THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH FRESH WATER, OF COURSE, BECAUSE THEIR MISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TO GO TO MARIEL AND DOCK THERE. SO THE TEMPERATURE IS RISING. IT REACHED UP TO 140 FAHRENHEIT IN THE DIESEL COMPARTMENTS. PEOPLE WERE FAINTING. THEY PRACTICALLY WALKED AROUND NAKED. IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT AMERICAN FORCES FINALLY DETECT AND RESPOND TO THE SOVIET SUBMARINES SO CLOSE TO THEIR COAST. THE DAY AFTER KENNEDY'S SPEECH, A SECRET SOUND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, CALLED SOSUS, BEGINS TO PICK UP A LOT OF TARGETS. SUBMARINES MAKE SOUNDS THAT YOU CAN PICK UP AT ENORMOUS DISTANCES. THEY DON'T GET DISTORTED BY THE SEA. THEY FIND THAT THEY CAN PUT THESE ARRAYS OF LISTENING DEVICES IN THE OCEAN, AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR SUBMARINES HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY, WHICH IS AMAZING. IN THEORY, ENEMY SUBMARINES CAN BE DETECTED UP TO 600 MILES OUT FROM THE U. S. COAST. IF THEY GET PICKED UP, YOU CAN THEN SEND OUT AN AIRPLANE TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE, YOU CAN START TRACKING THEM. BEGINNING ON OCTOBER 23rd, WHEN SOSUS DETECTS THE TARGETS, AIRCRAFT ARE DISPATCHED FOR CONFIRMATION. THE AIRCRAFT ESTABLISH VISUAL CONTACT WITH SNORKELS AND PERISCOPES OF THE SOVIET SUBS. IN OCTOBER 1962, AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE KNOWS THE SOVIET SUBMARINES POSE A REAL THREAT. THE FOUR FOXTROT SUBMARINES EACH HAD 21 CONVENTIONAL TORPEDOES, HIGH EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS DESIGNED TO SINK SURFACE SHIPS OR SUBMARINES. BUT THERE IS ONE CRITICAL FACT THE AMERICANS DO NOT KNOW. JUST BEFORE THEY LEFT PORT, A SPECIAL WEAPON WAS ADDED TO THE ARSENAL OF THE SOVIET SUBMARINES. IN ADDITION, EACH OF THE FOUR SUBMARINES HAD ONE NUCLEAR TORPEDO. WITH TEN KILOTONS OF EXPLOSIVE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LARGER THAN HALF THE EXPLOSIVE POWER USED AGAINST HIROSHIMA OR NAGASAKI. THE ORDERS OF HOW AND WHEN TO USE THESE WEAPONS IS MURKY. THE CAPTAINS LATER REPORT THEY WERE GIVEN A VERBAL BRIEFING BEFORE LEAVING THE USSR. THEY SAID THAT THE ORAL INSTRUCTIONS WERE THAT YOU USE IT IN THREE SITUATIONS. FIRST, YOU USE IT IF YOU ARE ATTACKED AND YOU HAVE HOLE IN THE HULL ABOVE THE WATER. IF YOU ARE ATTACKED UNDER THE WATER AND YOU HAVE A HOLE IN YOUR HULL, AND THE THIRD ONE, IF YOU GET DIRECT ORDERS FROM MOSCOW. APPARENTLY ADMIRAL FORKEN SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT, WELL, IF THEY SLAP YOU ON THE RIGHT HAND, DON'T LET THEM TO SLAP YOU ON THE LEFT. USE YOUR WEAPONS. DO NOT BECOME THE SHAME OF THE FLEET. THE USE OF A NUCLEAR TORPEDO DURING A NAVAL BATTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNPRECEDENTED. IF ONE FIRES A CONVENTIONAL TORPEDO AT AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER, IT WOULD CAUSE MAJOR DAMAGE. TO SINK A CARRIER OF THAT SIZE, YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEED TWO, THREE TORPEDO HITS. A NUCLEAR TORPEDO... EVEN EXPLODING NEAR A CARRIER, WOULD DESTROY THE CARRIER AND ANY SHIPS WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THE CARRIER. AND IF IT DIDN'T SINK THEM, THEY WOULD BE SO WRECKED THAT THEY'D BE FLOATING HULKS. THE SCALE OF THIS POTENTIAL DEVASTATION WAS CONFIRMED BY AMERICAN TESTS AT BIKINI ATOLL IN 1946. AFTER KENNEDY ANNOUNCES HIS PLAN FOR A QUARANTINE LINE, MOSCOW ORDERS THE SOVIET SUBS TO WITHDRAW TO AN AREA CALLED THE SARGASSO SEA AND AWAIT FURTHER ORDERS. THE CAPTAINS RECEIVE LITTLE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE KREMLIN. ONCE MORE, THE SUB'S RADIO INTERCEPT GROUP PROVES ITS VALUE. THEY GATHER INFORMATION FROM OPEN BROADCASTS, THEY LISTEN TO U. S. RADIO AND TV. THE SOVIET SUBMARINE CREWS HAVE BEEN KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE BUILD-UP IN CUBA. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY LEARN WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD KNOWS. IT'S FROM THIS UNIT THAT THE COMMANDERS LEARNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE SOVIET UNION INSTALLED NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON CUBA. THEY HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THAT. THE CREW ALSO LEARNS OF KENNEDY'S THREAT TO STOP AND SEARCH ANY SHIP APPROACHING THE QUARANTINE LINE. BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE SOVIET UNION PLANS TO RESPOND. ON OCTOBER 24th, THE WHITE HOUSE MONITORS TWO SOVIET SHIPS REPORTED TO BE CLOSE TO THE QUARANTINE LINE. AS THE ADMINISTRATION WAITS, INTELLIGENCE SOURCES REVEAL THE PRESENCE OF SOVIET SUBMARINES IN THE REGION. INTO THE 1960s, THE THREAT POSED BY ENEMY SUBMARINES WERE THE SAME AS DURING WORLD WAR II. THE MAIN ISSUE WITH SUBMARINES IS THEY'LL ATTACK YOUR SHIPS. WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE LEARNS THAT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE OR MAYBE TWO SUBMARINES NEAR THE QUARANTINE LINE, DISCUSSIONS HEAT UP. PRESIDENT KENNEDY IMAGINES A WORST-CASE SCENARIO. IF THIS SUBMARINE SHOULD SINK OUR DESTROYER, THEN WHAT IS OUR PROPOSED REPLY? EVERYONE WORRIES THAT ANY MILITARY ACTION COULD ESCALATE TO A NUCLEAR CONFLICT. TO AVOID AN INCIDENT, DEFENSE SECRETARY McNAMARA PROPOSES A PROTOCOL TO BRING THE SOVIET SUBMARINES TO THE SURFACE. WE HAVE DEPTH CHARGES THAT HAVE SUCH A SMALL CHARGE THAT THEY CAN BE DROPPED AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY HIT THE SUBMARINE WITHOUT DAMAGING THE SUBMARINE. KENNEDY REMAINS SKEPTICAL. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE FIRST THING WE ATTACK IS THE SOVIET SUBMARINE. McNAMARA BELIEVES THE THREAT TO AMERICAN SHIPS CAN BE REDUCED IF THE SOVIET SUBS CAN BE BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE AND ESCORTED OUT OF HARM'S WAY. HE INTENDS TO ASK MOSCOW TO INFORM THE SUBMARINE CAPTAINS OF THE PLAN. CRITICALLY, THE AMERICANS REMAIN UNAWARE OF THE WEAPONS ON BOARD THE SOVIET SUBMARINES. McNAMARA DOES NOT KNOW THAT THE GREATEST THREAT FOR A NUCLEAR ATTACK MAY COME FROM THE VERY SUBMARINES HE IS TRYING TO FORCE TO THE SURFACE. IN OCTOBER OF 1962, PRESIDENT KENNEDY IMPOSES A QUARANTINE LINE AROUND CUBA TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER BUILD-UP OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THE ISLAND. NEARLY 200 U. S. NAVY SHIPS HAVE BEEN MOBILIZED AND PREPARE TO STOP ANY SHIPS APPROACHING CUBA. THE NAVY MONITORS TWO VESSELS IN PARTICULAR- THE YURI GAGARIN AND KIMOVSK. EVERYONE WORRIES THAT IF THE SOVIET SHIPS REFUSE TO STOP AND BE SEARCHED AT THE QUARANTINE LINE, WAR WILL BE INEVITABLE. ON OCTOBER 24th, AFTER DAYS OF TENSION, THE WHITE HOUSE LEARNS THAT THE YURI GAGARIN AND KIMOVSK HAVE REVERSED COURSE TO THE SOVIET UNION. THEIR RELIEF IS IMMEDIATE. BUT THERE IS STILL A PROBLEM. EVEN THOUGH KHRUSHCHEV ORDERED THE SOVIET SHIPS TO TURN AROUND, THE SUBMARINES ARE STILL IN THE AREA AND CONSIDERED A THREAT. THE FOUR SOVIET SUBMARINES START TO WITHDRAW INTO AN AREA CALLED THE SARGASSO SEA AND AWAIT ORDERS FROM MOSCOW. MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT EVEN AFTER THE SOVIET SHIPS TURNED AROUND, WE WERE STILL APPROACHING THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR. IN THE SARGASSO SEA, JUST OFF THE U. S. COAST, AN AMERICAN HUNTER-KILLER GROUP LED BY THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS RANDOLPH TRACKS SOVIET SUB B-59. WITH ASSISTANCE FROM FIVE DESTROYERS AND AIRCRAFT, THEY PURSUE THE SUB USING UNDERWATER SOUND SURVEILLANCE, OR SOSUS DETECTIONS. IN A CLASSIC CAT- AND-MOUSE GAME, FOR TWO DAYS, SOVIET CAPTAIN SAVITSKY HAS FOUGHT TO KEEP HIS SUBMARINE CONCEALED. BUT SAVITSKY IS WORRIED. THE CREW CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM EXTREME HEAT. AND HIS BATTERIES BEGIN TO DIE. IF HE GETS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE SURFACE TO USE HIS SNORKEL TO RUN HIS ENGINES AND CHARGE HIS BATTERIES, HE WILL BE SPOTTED IMMEDIATELY. EVEN SO, SAVITSKY DECIDES HE HAS NO CHOICE. HE MUST SURFACE. BUT B-59 HAS MANAGED TO TRIGGER AN AMERICAN DETECTION DEVICE KNOWN AS A SONOBUOY. SONOBUOY IS A WORD MADE OUT OF SONAR PLUS BUOY. BUOY MEANS IT'S SITTING IN THE WATER. THE SONAR IS SOMETHING UNDERNEATH. THE WHOLE POINT OF A SONOBUOY IS IT'S SOMETHING THE AIRPLANE CAN DROP THAT GOES INTO THE WATER. IF MOST OF DETECTING SUBS IS LISTENING FOR THEIR SOUND, THE AIRPLANE HAS TO HAVE SOME EAR THAT CAN STICK INTO THE WATER. WHEN THE SONOBUOYS DETECT SUBMARINES, THEY TRANSMIT INFORMATION TO HELP PLANES HONE IN ON THE TARGET. THE NEAREST TRACKER PLANE CLOSES IN. THEY KNOW THEY'VE LOCATED A FOXTROT SUBMARINE. AIRCRAFT FROM AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS RANDOLPH CALL IN ASSISTANCE FROM A SURFACE UNIT OF DESTROYERS. ALL CONVERGE ON B-59. AS PER HIS ORDERS, SAVITSKY CANNOT ALLOW THE AMERICAN VESSELS TO INTERCEPT HIS SUBMARINE. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIS SPEED ON THE SURFACE, HE HEADS NORTH, TO HIDE WITHIN A RAIN SQUALL. BUT BEFORE HE GETS THERE, HE'S SPOTTED BY A TRACKER PLANE. SAVITSKY ORDERS A CRASH DIVE. THE DESTROYERS CONTINUE TO CLOSE IN, USING THEIR ACTIVE SONAR TO LOCATE THE SUB WITH PINGS. AS PER DEFENSE SECRETARY McNAMARA'S PLAN, THE SHIPS BEGIN TO DROP PRACTICE DEPTH CHARGES TO SIGNAL THE SUBMARINE TO COME TO THE SURFACE. BUT PRACTICE DEPTH CHARGES ARE INTENDED TO ALERT, NOT DAMAGE THE SUB. McNAMARA HAD NOTIFIED THE SOVIETS OF HIS SURFACING PLAN THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS, BUT WORD HAD NOT MADE IT TO THE SUBMARINE CAPTAINS. DEEP BELOW, SAVITSKY KNOWS THERE ARE MANY AMERICAN CRAFT OVERHEAD. AND B-59 HAS NOT HAD ENOUGH TIME TO CHARGE ITS BATTERIES, AND THEY ARE DYING. SAVITSKY RACKS HIS BRAIN IN THE AWFUL HEAT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT, WHEN EXPLOSIONS START GOING OFF. IT SOUNDED TO THEM, IT FELT TO THEM THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ATTACKED BY THESE DEPTH GRENADES. ONE OR TWO OF THEM EXPLODED RIGHT ON THE HULL, AND AS THEY DESCRIBED IT, IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE SITTING IN A METAL BARREL AND SOMEBODY IS HITTING IT WITH A HAMMER REPEATEDLY. THE COMBINATION OF SONAR PINGS AND EXPLOSIONS WOULD BE A SUBMARINE CAPTAIN'S WORST FEAR. THE IRONY WITH THIS PLAN IS THAT THESE ARE THE EXACT SAME SYSTEMS USED TO ATTACK A SUBMARINE. SAVITSKY IS CONVINCED THAT WAR HAS BROKEN OUT AND A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE MAY BE IMMINENT. HE MUST BE READY TO COUNTER ATTACK WITH HIS TORPEDOES. HE ORDERS THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THE NUCLEAR TORPEDO TO READY THE SPECIAL WEAPON. YOU WERE IN THIS INCREDIBLE HEAT, HAVE NO COMMUNICATIONS WITH MOSCOW BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SURFACE FOR THE COMMUNICATION, AND YOU HAVE NO INFORMATION FROM RADIO INTERCEPT, AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'RE BEING HAMMERED. WITH HIS BATTERIES NEARLY DEAD, SAVITSKY ONCE AGAIN HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO COME TO THE SURFACE OR LOSE THE SUBMARINE. BELIEVING HE IS UNDER ATTACK, TO EVEN THE ODDS, HE COULD FIRE HIS NUCLEAR TORPEDO, AND IN SO DOING, TRIGGER THE WORLD'S FIRST NUCLEAR WAR. OCTOBER 27, 1962. SOVIET SUBMARINE B-59 HAS JUST BEEN FORCED TO THE SURFACE BY AMERICAN DESTROYERS AND THE CARRIER USS RANDOLPH. WHAT MADE THE SITUATION EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING IS THAT, UNKNOWN TO THE UNITED STATES, EACH OF THOSE FOXTROT SUBMARINES HAD A NUCLEAR TORPEDO ON BOARD, AND WE KNOW THE SUBMARINE COMMANDING OFFICER WAS BECOMING SO FRUSTRATED WITH OUR ANTI-SUBMARINE FORCES AND THE LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE SUBMARINE, THE LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH MOSCOW, THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING USING A NUCLEAR TORPEDO AGAINST U. S. SHIPS. IN MANY RESPECTS, IT WAS THE MOST FRIGHTENING MOMENT OF THE ENTIRE 45 YEARS OF THE COLD WAR. THE SUBMARINE'S CAPTAIN, VALENTIN SAVITSKY, THE POLITICAL OFFICER ON BOARD, AND BRIGADE CHIEF OF STAFF VASILY ARKHIPOV MUST ALL AGREE TO FIRE THE WEAPON. THE POLITICAL OFFICER CONSENTS, BUT ARKHIPOV HESITATES. SAVITSKY WAS THE MORE EMOTIONAL ONE OF THE TWO, AND HE WAS JUST KIND OF REALLY BURSTING WITH EMOTION, ANGER, HUMILIATION AT BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS PURSUIT. DESPITE THE CLAMOR, ARKHIPOV SEEMS TO RECOGNIZE THEY ARE NOT BEING ATTACKED. THEIR SUBMARINE HAS NOT BEEN DAMAGED. HIS PRESENCE PROVES CRITICAL. HE CALMS SAVITSKY DOWN. I THINK HAVING HIM NEXT TO SAVITSKY AT THAT MOMENT REALLY HELPS, BECAUSE SAVITSKY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION ONCE HE, YOU KNOW, LOOKS AROUND, BUT WHO KNOWS? THE SUBMARINE IS SURROUNDED BY SHIPS. SEARCHLIGHTS ILLUMINATE IT IN THE DARK. ON THE SURFACE, SAVITSKY SEES THE AMERICAN SHIP SIGNALING. HE HAS HIS SIGNALING OFFICER REPLY, IDENTIFYING HIS SOVIET SUBMARINE AND ASKING THE U. S. FORCES TO STOP THEIR PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS. WITH THE REALIZATION THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE THREAT, SAVITSKY USES THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECHARGE HIS BATTERIES. WHEN THEY ARE FULLY CHARGED, SAVITSKY SUBMERGES AND BREAKS AWAY FROM THE DESTROYERS. BUT THE OTHER THREE SUBMARINES ARE STILL AT LARGE. PURSUED BY THE CARRIER USS ESSEX, B- 130'S THREE ENGINES BREAK DOWN. THEY LIMP AS FAR AS THE AZORES ON ONE REBUILT ENGINE BEFORE IT ALSO GIVES OUT. WE HAVE A HIT. 1,000 YARDS. BEARING 2-1-5. A U. S. DESTROYER SPOTS AND BEGINS TO ESCORT B-36 OUT OF THE AREA. B- 36 MANAGES TO ESCAPE WITH A DEEP DIVE. SOVIET SUBMARINE B-4 MAY HAVE BEEN DETECTED, BUT IS NEVER LOCATED AND FORCED TO SURFACE. IN THE END, THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS IS RESOLVED BY COMPROMISE. KHRUSHCHEV AGREES TO REMOVE THE OFFENDING MISSILES FROM CUBA. BUT JFK'S TOUGH TALK HIDES HIS CONCESSIONS. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE WIN BECAUSE WE CONCEAL THE FACT THAT THERE'S REALLY A DEAL. THE REAL DEAL IS THAT WE REMOVE THE MISSILES IN ITALY AND TURKEY. ONCE THAT'S THE CASE, KHRUSHCHEV HAS ELIMINATED THE IMMEDIATE THREAT THAT BOTHERS HIM. AT THE TIME, THE AMERICANS DID NOT KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY CAME TO A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE. IT TAKES DECADES BEFORE THE U. S. LEARNS ABOUT THE TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS ABOARD THE SOVIET SUBMARINES. IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS. IT WAS MORE DANGEROUS THAN WE THOUGHT- NOT BECAUSE KENNEDY AND KHRUSHCHEV AND CASTRO WERE LUNATICS, BUT BECAUSE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS THAT THEY COULD NOT CONTROL. IN THE MOMENTS OF TENSION, MALFUNCTIONING EQUIPMENT, LACK OF INFORMATION, PEOPLE COULD ACT RATIONALLY FOR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES, LEADING TO COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL, TRAGIC OUTCOMES. ALL THE SOVIET SUBMARINES RETURN TO THE USSR BY DECEMBER. THEIR MISSION WAS REGARDED AS A FAILURE. INSTEAD OF HEROES WHO AVOIDED A NUCLEAR WAR, SOME FELT THE CAPTAINS SHOULD HAVE USED THEIR NUCLEAR TORPEDOES. ACCORDING TO ALL THE COMMANDERS THAT I TALKED TO, WHAT MATTERS IS THAT THEY VIOLATED THEIR ORDERS. SO THEY'RE COMING BACK, AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING, YOU KNOW, "HOW... HOW EMBARRASSING. YOU VIOLATED YOUR ORDERS. YOU HUMILIATED THE FLEET." THE RECEPTION WAS VERY UNFRIENDLY. THE SOVIET SUBMARINES CONFIRM THE REAL RISKS POSED BY JUST THE PRESENCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS... THE THREAT FROM INDIVIDUAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS, OR EVEN MISTAKES. THE STORY OF B-59 REVEALS THE HUMAN VULNERABILITIES THAT COULD ULTIMATELY BRING US ALL TO THE BRINK OF WAR.
