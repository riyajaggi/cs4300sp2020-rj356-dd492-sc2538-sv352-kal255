 Narrator: IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, ONE OF HITLER'S MOST SUCCESSFUL U-BOAT ACES, OTTO KRETSCHMER, SINKS DOZENS OF ALLIED SHIPS. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: FIRST ALONE, THEN AS PART OF THE LETHAL WOLFPACKS... [BOOM] UNTIL A FATEFUL MISTAKE... [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: ...THREATENS EVERYTHING. [EXPLOSIONS]

 IN WORLD WAR II, A SUBSEA WEAPON ALLOWS WARRIORS TO FIGHT FROM BENEATH THE WAVES. WITH CUNNING, FORCE AND TENACITY, THEIR ENEMIES STRIKE BACK. [EXPLOSIONS] REVOLUTIONARY BUT STILL SOMETIMES PRIMITIVE, IT'S A DESPERATE BID TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WAR. THEIR STORIES ARE LEGEND. ♪ JULY 8, 1940. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: NAZI U-BOAT U-99 HAS SUNK AN ALLIED MERCHANT SHIP JUST SOUTH OF IRELAND. [SPEAKING GERMAN]

 Narrator: NOW A BRITISH ESCORT TURNS IN PURSUIT. Christian Jentzsch: WHEN YOU ATTACK THE ENEMY, YOU ARE THE HUNTER. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Jentzsch: AND AS SOON AS YOU GET ATTACKED BY THE ESCORTS, YOU ARE THE PREY. Narrator: THE CREW OF U-99 PERFORMS A DIVE TO ESCAPE. [BELL RINGING] ♪ Narrator: U-BOAT COMMANDER OTTO KRETSCHMER HAS SERVED HITLER'S UNDERWATER SERVICE SINCE THE START OF WORLD WAR II. HE'S JUST SUNK HIS 12th SHIP IN 10 MONTHS... [SONAR PING] AND EARNED A REPUTATION AS THE BEST TORPEDO SHOT IN THE GERMAN NAVY. [PING] HE PROVES RUTHLESSLY EFFICIENT. HIS MOTTO IS "ONE TORPEDO, ONE SHIP." [EXPLOSION] Marc Milner: OTTO KRETSCHMER WAS NOT ONE OF THE ORDINARY SUBMARINE COMMANDERS, RIGHT. HE'S OF A... PART OF AN ELITE GROUP WHO REALLY DO MOST OF THE DAMAGE. NOT ONLY IS HE PLEASANT AND SKILLED, BUT HE'S COLD AS A CUCUMBER. Narrator: IT'S ONLY KRETSCHMER'S SECOND PATROL ABOARD THE RECENTLY COMMISSIONED U-99. [PING] HE AND HIS UNTRIED CREW FACE AN EXPLOSIVE INITIATION. Jentzsch: IT'S THE FIRST TIME WHEN THE COOL AND CALM CHARACTER OF KRETSCHMER IS VIRTUALLY FORGED IN FLAMES, BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST TIME WHEN HE'S ATTACKED BY ALLIED ESCORTS. ♪ [PING] ♪ Narrator: THE WARSHIP THAT HUNTS KRETSCHMER IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S NEW FLOWER-CLASS CORVETTES. 205 FEET LONG WITH A DISPLACEMENT OF 940 TONS... IT'S BEEN ADAPTED FROM COMMERCIAL WHALERS TO HUNT SUBMARINES. [BOOM] [EXPLOSION] Milner: SO WHEN THE WAR STARTS, THE ATTACK THAT THE GERMANS LAUNCH ON BRITISH TRADE IS UNANTICIPATED. AND THE BRITISH ARE SIMPLY NOT MATERIALLY PREPARED FOR IT, NOR ARE THEY PSYCHOLOGICALLY PREPARED FOR IT. AND THE BRITS HAVE TO ADAPT THEIR, THEIR MARITIME PREPARATIONS TO DEAL WITH WARFARE THAT THEY JUST ARE NOT READY FOR. [PING] Narrator: JUST AFTER 8 A. M... [PING] [PING] THE FLOWER-CLASS CORVETTE LAUNCHES UNDERWATER BOMBS CALLED DEPTH CHARGES... IN A BID TO SINK KRETSCHMER'S SUBMARINE. THEY WEIGH ABOUT 400 POUNDS AND DETONATE WHEN THEY SINK TO A PRE-SET DEPTH BETWEEN 50 AND 500 FEET. Jentzsch: ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WILL BE THE EXPLOSIONS. [BOOM] [BOOM] THE SUBMARINE IS THROWN AROUND UNDERWATER. KRETSCHMER DESCRIBED IT LIKE A THOUSAND HAMMERS KNOCKING ON THE SUBMARINE. [EXPLOSIONS] AND WHEN THE DEPTH CHARGE EXPLODED ONE AFTER THE OTHER, THEY LOOK AROUND IN THE SUBMARINE- IS THERE SOMETHING BROKEN? IS THE HULL STILL FULLY INTACT? THEY DO NOT ONLY DROP ONE SALVO, TWO SALVO, OR THREE SALVOS, THEY START ATTACKING FOR HOURS AND HOURS. Narrator: U-99 IS A TYPE VII U-BOAT. FIRST COMMISSIONED IN 1936, THEY ARE 218 FEET LONG AND 20 FEET WIDE. TYPE VIIs NORMALLY CARRY 14 TORPEDOES AND A CREW OF 45 MEN. [BELL RINGING] GERMANY PRODUCES MORE OF THEM THAN ANY OTHER SUBMARINE. Eric Grove: THE TYPE VII U-BOAT IS ACTUALLY A BIT ON THE SMALL SIDE. IT'S DEVELOPED FROM THE SO-CALLED UB SUBMARINE, ONE OF THE SMALLER SUBMARINES OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR. IT DID HAVE SIGNIFICANT SEAGOING CAPACITY. Narrator: MORE THAN 700 WERE BUILT BASED ON ITS RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE DESIGN. THE MAN WHO DEPLOYS THE U-BOATS IS KARL DÖNITZ- HITLER'S MASTERMIND OF SUBMARINES. Milner: I THINK THE BEST WAY TO UNDERSTAND KARL DÖNITZ IS HE'S A CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL SUBMARINER. HE LIVED, BREATHED, AND THOUGHT SUBMARINES ALL THE TIME. Narrator: DÖNITZ LAUNCHES HIS U-BOATS TO KEY SHIPPING ROUTES IN A BID TO STRANGLE THE BRITISH ISLES. Jann Witt: THIS BECAME THE CORE STRATEGY OF THE GERMAN NAVAL COMMAND, TO CUT THOSE LIFELINES, THOSE MARITIME LIFELINES, FIGHTING THE CONVOYS, STARVING BRITAIN INTO DEFEAT. Milner: THE WHOLE THING TURNS INTO QUITE LITERALLY, AS IT'S OFTEN BEEN SAID, A CHESS MATCH, BECAUSE YOU'RE MATCHING WITS WITH THE OTHER GUY. WHERE IS HE NOW AND WHERE WILL HE BE? YOU'VE GOT TO BE THINKING SEVERAL MOVES AHEAD. Narrator: DÖNITZ USES NAVAL INTELLIGENCE TO ASSIGN THE FEW SUBMARINES HE HAS TO LOCATE SHIPS. Grove: THERE ARE NOT MANY U-BOATS AT SEA AT THIS STAGE OF THE WAR. THE GERMANS HAVE HAD TO MAKE CHOICES IN THEIR WAR PRODUCTION, AND U-BOATS WERE NOT ONE OF THOSE CHOICES BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY WERE PLANNING TO FIGHT ON LAND, FIRST IN THE WEST AND THEN IN THE EAST. Jentzsch: SO HE HAD TO USE THESE SMALL NUMBERS, AND THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO IS TO SPREAD THEM OVER THE OCEAN LIKE BUTTER ON A VERY BIG SHEET OF BREAD. THEREFORE, IN THE FIRST STAGES OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THEY WERE STILL FIGHTING LIKE IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR, ONE SUBMARINE ON ONE PATROL ON ITS OWN. [BOOM] Narrator: EARLY ON JULY 8, DÖNITZ'S U-99 ATTACKED THE ENEMY ALONE AND HAS BEEN UNDER SIEGE FOR HOURS. [PING] [EXPLOSION] Jentzsch: EVERYBODY IS UNDER STRESS. SO THE SWEAT IS COMING ON THEIR FACE, DROPPING DOWN. AND IF YOU ARE UNDER STRESS, YOU BREATHE A LOT. [EXPLOSION] Narrator: UNCERTAIN OF HOW LONG THE ATTACK WILL LAST, KRETSCHMER TAKES ACTION TO PRESERVE THE SUBMARINE'S LIMITED SUPPLY OF AIR. Jentzsch: THE COMMANDING OFFICER NEEDS TO CONSERVE THE OXYGEN. AND SO THE PEOPLE GET THE ORDER TO LIE DOWN, TO SLEEP. [PING] [COUGHING] THEY GET BISCUITS AND THEY GET CHOCOLATE TO GET OVER THE SITUATION. AFTER HOURS THEY ARE PROBABLY VERY FATIGUED. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Narrator: SOME OF THE CREW DON MASKS THAT ABSORB CARBON DIOXIDE IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE THE U-BOAT'S ATMOSPHERE LAST. [BREATHING] Witt: IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE WHAT THESE PEOPLE FELT IN THIS VERY MOMENT. IT MUST BE, MUST HAVE BEEN HORRENDOUS. Narrator: BUT AS ANOTHER SALVO HITS, THE MAN WHO COMMANDS THE U-BOAT APPEARS UNFAZED. Jentzsch: KRETSCHMER WAS SITTING VERY CALM AND READING A NOVEL, A CRIMINAL NOVEL. AND THE GUY ON THE HYDROACOUSTICS, KASSEL, WAS LOOKING AT HIM, AND HE THOUGHT, OH, THAT'S A GREAT GUY. WE ARE UNDER THE PRESSURE, HE'S JUST SITTING AROUND READING HIS NOVEL. [EXPLOSIONS] AFTER SOME MINUTES, KASSEL AGAIN IS LOOKING AT HIM, AND HE REALIZED THE BOOK IS UPSIDE DOWN, SO HE CAN'T READ, AND ALL THE TIME HE DID NOT FLIP ANY PAGE. SO KRETSCHMER IN THIS CASE WAS A BRILLIANT MILITARY LEADER. "I CAN TAKE THE TIME TO JUST READ A NOVEL, SO YOU COULD KEEP CALM, TOO." [EXPLOSIONS] [EXPLOSIONS] WHEN THE ATTACKS ARE GOING ON FOR HOURS, KRETSCHMER HAD TO KEEP IN MIND A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. THE FIRST THING IS TO KEEP THE SUBMARINE IN A DEPTH WHERE IT DOESN'T GET DESTROYED BY THE PRESSURE OF THE WATER. AND THEREFORE HE NEEDS PROPULSION. AND TO PRODUCE PROPULSION, HE NEEDS TO USE BATTERY ENERGY. Narrator: SUBMERGED, 124 BATTERY CELLS POWER U-99'S PROPELLERS AND ALL ITS SYSTEMS. THEY CAN ONLY BE RECHARGED ON THE SURFACE. ♪ TWELVE HOURS AFTER THE DEPTH CHARGE ATTACK BEGINS, KRETSCHMER AND HIS CREW REMAIN PINNED DOWN. ♪ [PING] ♪ Jentzsch: KRETSCHMER IS TOLD BY HIS ENGINEER THAT HE'S RUNNING LOW OF BATTERY FUEL. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: KRETSCHMER MUST MAKE A MOVE, OR U-99 WILL BE LOST TO THE SEA. Jentzsch: TO WAIT UNTIL THE BATTERY IS TOTALLY DOWN, THEN THERE'S NO CHANCE OF SURVIVING. ♪ [BOOM] Narrator: DURING 12 HOURS OF DEPTH CHARGE ATTACK... [EXPLOSIONS] U- 99 HAS BEEN CRUISING JUST FAST ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT DEPTH, TO CONSERVE POWER. Jentzsch: TO KEEP HIS SUBMARINE MOVING, HE NEEDS THE PROPULSION, AND THEREFORE HE HAD TO USE THE BATTERY FUEL IN AN EFFICIENT WAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE BOAT ON MOVING FOR PROPULSION OR FOR OPERATIONS. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: AS HIS BATTERIES DIE, KRETSCHMER RISKS THE LAST OF HIS POWER ON A COURSE CHANGE, IN A FINAL BID TO ESCAPE. Witt: KRETSCHMER AND HIS CREW TRY TO EVADE BY ZIGZAGGING, CHANGING DEPTH, AND THE LIKES. Narrator: MORE THAN 14 HOURS AFTER THE ATTACK BEGAN... THE SOUND OF ENEMY PROPELLERS FADES. Jentzsch: AND THEN THEY HAD THE INFORMATION THAT THE ESCORTS WERE MOVING AWAY. ♪ Narrator: U-99 SURVIVES 127 DEPTH CHARGES. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Jentzsch: BATTERY FUEL WAS EXTREMELY LOW AND OXYGEN WAS NEARLY DISPOSED, AND THEREFORE HE HAD TO GET UP. ♪ Narrator: WHEN THEY SURFACE, THE ESCORTS HAVE MOVED OUT OF SIGHT. ♪ Jentzsch: IT IS SAID THAT THE AIR IS YELLOW GREENISH. AND THE AUTHOR OF ONE FAMOUS NOVEL ABOUT KRETSCHMER, HE EXPLAINS, LOOKING LIKE THE DEATH LEAVING THE SUBMARINE. [CREW LAUGHING] HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GERMAN COMMANDING SUBMARINE OFFICERS TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF A LONG-LASTING DEPTH CHARGE. HE WAS LUCKY, SO THE ESCORTS REALLY DISAPPEARED. [TALKING AND LAUGHING] ♪ Narrator: TO THE EAST, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF GERMANY'S U-BOATS GAINS A CRITICAL WIN. HITLER'S TROOPS HAVE INVADED FRANCE. DÖNITZ CAN USE ITS ATLANTIC PORTS TO LAUNCH HIS SUBMARINES. Witt: AFTER THE FALL OF FRANCE IN 1940, THE GERMANS SUDDENLY POSSESSED NEW BASES IDEALLY SUITED FOR ATTACKS ON THE BRITISH CONVOYS IN THE ATLANTIC. BEFORE THAT, THEY HAD TO, TO SEND OUT THEIR BOATS FROM, FROM THEIR BASES IN GERMANY, WHICH MEANT THEY WOULD SPEND A LOT OF FUEL FOR TRAVELING TO AND FRO THOSE OPERATIONAL AREAS. AND SO NOW IN FRANCE THE BOATS HAD CONSIDERABLY MORE TIME FOR ACTUALLY HUNTING AND FIGHTING THE ALLIED CONVOYS. ♪ Narrator: ON OCTOBER 13, 1940, DÖNITZ DEPLOYS U-99 FROM LORIENT, FRANCE. INTELLIGENCE HAS LEARNED 34 ENEMY SHIPS TRANSPORT TIMBER, STEEL AND OTHER WAR MATERIALS IN A CONVOY FROM CANADA TO BRITAIN. Grove: A CONVOY IS A GROUPING OF SHIPS, A NUMBER OF SHIPS TOGETHER ESCORTED BY A NUMBER OF WARSHIPS. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT PUTTING A LOT OF SHIPS TOGETHER IS A LOT OF EGGS IN ONE BASKET, BUT ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THE SEA IS SUCH A BIG PLACE, IF YOU CONCENTRATE SHIPPING, THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE ENEMY TO EVEN FIND THEM. AND WHEN THEY FIND THEM, THEY FIND THEM ESCORTED WITH WARSHIPS, AND IT'S A HARD JOB TO ATTACK THEM. Narrator: KRETSCHMER AND HIS CREW RACE NORTHWEST IN SEARCH OF CONVOY SC 7. Grove: ALL CONVOY ROUTES HAVE THEIR OWN DESIGNATION. HX, HALIFAX; SC, SLOW CONVOY FOR SLOW SHIPS, WHEN THEY START CONVOYS FOR SLOW SHIPS. SO IT NORMALLY MEANS SOMETHING, AND IT HELPS DIVIDE CONVOYS UP. ♪ Narrator: DÖNITZ ASSIGNS MORE U-BOATS TO JOIN KRETSCHMER IN LOCATING THE CONVOY. IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST MOBILIZATIONS OF A WOLFPACK- A TACTIC THAT HITLER'S SUBMARINES WOULD MAKE FAMOUS. Grove: THE ESSENCE OF THE RUDELTAKTIK, THE WOLF TACTIC, WAS TO BRING SEVERAL SUBMARINES TO BEAR AGAINST THE CONVOY. Milner: THE CONTROL OF THE WOLFPACK IS DONE ASHORE, AT DÖNITZ'S HEADQUARTERS. IT'S ON THE BIG BOARD, YOU KNOW, BIG PLOT, LITTLE PINS AND MOVE SUBMARINES AROUND. THINK OF IT AS A KIND OF VAST DRIFTNET OF SUBMARINES AT ABOUT TWICE THE VISIBILITY DISTANCE APART, ONE FROM THE OTHER, DEPLOYED PERPENDICULAR TO THE LINE OF ADVANCE THAT YOU'D EXPECT CONVOYS TO FOLLOW. AND THE IDEA IS SIMPLY TO USE IT AS A KIND OF TRIPWIRE SYSTEM SO YOU CAN SNARE THEM. ♪ Narrator: ANOTHER SUBMARINE TO JOIN THE HUNT IS U-100. THE U-BOAT IS COMMANDED BY JOACHIM SCHEPKE: FRIEND AND RIVAL TO KRETSCHMER AND U-99. SCHEPKE AND KRETSCHMER WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO COMPLETE DÖNITZ'S ELITE SUBMARINE TRAINING. THIRTEEN MONTHS INTO THE WAR, THEY RANK AMONG HITLER'S U-BOAT ACES... CUNNING MEN DRIVEN TO SINK BRITAIN'S SHIPS. Milner: THE NUMBER OF ACES IN THE U-BOAT FLEET IS NEVER VERY BIG, AND THEY DO MOST OF THE HEAVY LIFTING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUCCESS RATE FOR GERMAN SUBMARINERS, ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE TONNAGE IS SUNK BY LIKE 20 PERCENT OF THE, OF THE CAPTAINS, BECAUSE THEY'RE PREPARED TO TAKE THINGS RIGHT TO THE EDGE. Narrator: BUT CAN THESE LONE WOLVES HUNT AS A PACK? ♪ BY FALL OF 1940, A NEW ERA OF SUBMARINE WARFARE HAS BEGUN. ADMIRAL KARL DÖNITZ COUNTS ON ACES KRETSCHMER AND SCHEPKE TO DELIVER ON HIS NEW WOLFPACK TACTIC. GERMANY HAS ONLY 27 OPERATIONAL SUBMARINES- NEARLY A THIRD OF DÖNITZ'S ACTIVE FLEET IS AT STAKE. Milner: HIS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IS TONNAGE SUNK PER U-BOAT DAY AT SEA. IT'S ALSO A LOGICAL STRATEGY. IT'S JUST ABOUT THE ONLY ONE THEY'VE GOT. BUT IT MEANS YOU DO HAVE TO SINK SHIPS. YOU HAVE TO DESTROY THEIR CARRYING CAPACITY. ♪ Narrator: ATTACKING A CONVOY PRESENTS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY. THE 34 MERCHANT SHIPS OF SLOW CONVOY 7 ARE PROTECTED BY ONLY FOUR ESCORTS. THEIR MAIN WEAPON FOR DETECTING U-BOATS IS SONAR... [PING] AN ACTIVE PINGING SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS ASDIC. Operator: ECHO BEARING GREEN TWO ZERO, DRAWING RIGHT. Narrator: ASDIC WAS INVENTED TOWARDS THE END OF WORLD WAR I. IT USES SOUND PULSES CALLED PINGS TO SEARCH THE OCEAN FOR SUBMARINES. [PING] Milner: THE BIG INNOVATION IN THE FALL OF 1918 WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ACTIVE ACOUSTIC LOCATION SYSTEM, DEVELOPED PRIMARILY BY THE FRENCH AND THEN SHARED WITH THE BRITISH. SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS THAT STUFF YOU SEE IN, IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES WHERE A SOUND GOES OUT, IT HITS SOMETHING, AND IT COMES BACK. AND YOU MEASURE THE DISTANCE, AND THAT GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF HOW FAR AWAY THE OBJECT IS. [PING] Grove: IT WAS THE KEY TO THE EXISTING ANTI-SUBMARINE TACTICS OF THE ROYAL NAVY. A SUBMERGED SUBMARINE IN FACT WAS VULNERABLE. BUT THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS THAT IT DOESN'T WORK AGAINST SURFACE VESSELS. AND WHEN A SUBMARINE BECOMES A LOW, HARD-TO-DETECT SURFACE VESSEL AT NIGHT, IT SOON PROVES TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS ENEMY INDEED. Narrator: AFTER CONVOY SC 7 IS INTERCEPTED, KRETSCHMER AND THE REST OF THE WOLFPACK CLOSE IN. Milner: AND THEN THE ORDER WOULD BE GIVEN THAT AT THE RIGHT MOMENT IN THE DARK OF NIGHT, YOU'RE FREE TO ATTACK. AND THEN THE PACK WOULD COME IN. THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE, NOT SIMPLY IN SINKING THE SHIPS BUT IN CREATING THAT SHOCK EFFECT AND DEMONSTRATING TO THE BRITISH THAT THEY CAN SINK THEIR SHIPPING AT WILL. Narrator: SCHEPKE AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS PREPARE TO FIRE FROM OUTSIDE THE CONVOY. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: BUT KRETSCHMER HAS HIS OWN PLAN. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: AT 10 P.M., U-99 SLINKS PAST THE ESCORTS TO AMBUSH THE ENEMY FROM WHERE THEY LEAST EXPECT IT. Witt: KRETSCHMER HAS THIS, THIS KILLER INSTINCT. HE IS A PERFECTIONIST. SO HE FINDS A WAY OF SNEAKING IN ON THE SURFACE INTO THE CONVOY. HE MANAGED COLD-BLOODED TO SAIL INSIDE THE CONVOY AND THEN STARTS TO TORPEDO THE MERCHANT VESSELS. ♪ [SPEAKING GERMAN] ♪ [SPEAKING GERMAN] ♪ [EXPLOSIONS] ♪ Milner: THE FIRST KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE THAT THERE'S AN ATTACK TAKING PLACE IS WHEN AN EXPLOSION STRIKES A SHIP AND THE FLARES START TO GO UP. THEN THE ESCORT HAS TO REACT. Narrator: THE ALLIES TARGET THE CONVOY'S PERIMETER WHERE THE U-BOATS USUALLY PROWL. [GUNFIRE] OTHERS IN THE WOLFPACK ARE FORCED TO DIVE. ♪ [PING] ♪ [PING] ♪ BUT INSIDE THE CONVOY... KRETSCHMER STAYS ON THE ATTACK. [SPEAKING GERMAN] ♪ [BOOM] Milner: IT TURNED INTO A PYROTECHNIC NIGHTMARE. THEY'RE JUST SINKING SHIPS. TERRIFYING FOR THE MEN IN THE CONVOY, JUST TERRIFYING. NO ONE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GET INSIDE THE CONVOY IN THE DARK OF NIGHT AND SPIT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OUT BOTH ENDS AT A HIGH SPEED. [EXPLOSIONS] Narrator: IN THE EARLY HOURS OF OCTOBER 19th, U- 99 FIRES THE LAST OF ITS 14 TORPEDOES. ♪ [EXPLOSION] THE CONVOY LOSES 20 SHIPS WHILE IN TRANSIT. 80,000 TONS OF SHIPPING IS LOST TO THE WAR EFFORT. SCHEPKE CLAIMS THREE SHIPS, KRETSCHMER SEVEN... MANY MORE THAN ANY OTHER ACE, IN ONE OF GERMANY'S FIRST WOLFPACK OFFENSIVES. Milner: IT'S A RADICALLY NEW KIND OF USE OF SUBMARINES THAT THE BRITS SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE DEFENSES FOR. ONCE THE WOLFPACK SNARES A CONVOY, IT'S CHAOS FOR THE ALLIES. [SPEAKING GERMAN] ♪ Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER U-99 DOCKS TO A CHEERING CROWD. KRETSCHMER AND HIS FELLOW COMMANDERS ARE CELEBRATED AS IDOLS. Witt: THE GERMAN U-BOAT ACES WERE USED BY THE, BY THE GERMAN WAR PROPAGANDA, OF COURSE, AS PROPAGANDA HEROES. YOU CAN ALMOST LIKE THEM TO THE POP STARS OF THEIR DAYS. IN ANY WAR IT'S VERY MUCH THE SAME-YOU NEED HEROES. YOU NEED SUCCESSES TO RAISE THE SPIRIT OF YOUR OWN FOLK. ♪ Narrator: IN BRITAIN, WAR STRATEGISTS RACE TO THWART GERMANY'S NEW U-BOAT TACTICS. Grove: THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S A MARITIME EMPIRE, AND IT RELIES ON SHIPPING. NOW, THAT'S A STRENGTH BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THE BRITISH CAN ACCESS THE WORLD AS FAR AS SUPPLIES ARE CONCERNED. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT MEANS BRITAIN MUST CONTROL THE SEA. Narrator: THE ROYAL NAVY REASSIGNS WARSHIPS GUARDING THE BRITISH COAST TO THE ATLANTIC TO PROTECT CONVOYS. Grove: IT MUST NOT ALLOW THE ENEMY TO DENY IT THE USE OF THE SEA. Narrator: EFFORTS ARE ALSO UNDER WAY TO APPLY A NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED RADAR, RADIO WAVES USED TO DETECT ENEMY AIRPLANES, TO THE SEAS. Milner: IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING TO MAKE THIS ADJUSTMENT, BRITAIN IS BEING BOMBED. ITS PORTS ARE BEING DESTROYED FROM THE AIR. THE BLITZ IS BEING LAUNCHED. [AIR RAID SIREN] IT'S A VERY TRYING PERIOD FOR BRITAIN. ♪ Narrator: MARCH 1941. NAZI WOLFPACKS HAVE DOMINATED THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC FOR FIVE MONTHS. NOW CONVOY HX 112 STEAMS IN TRANSIT FROM HALIFAX TO BRITAIN. Grove: HX, HALIFAX; HX 112 WAS THE 112th FAST INWARD-BOUND CONVOY. IT WAS COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SHIPS, TANKERS, CARGO SHIPS, ET CETERA. AND ONE OF THE FEATURES WHICH MAKES THIS CONVOY INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT IS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE U-BOATS ARE FACING A WELL-TRAINED ESCORT GROUP. Narrator: OVERSEEING THE SEVEN ESCORTS THAT GUARD THE 41-SHIP CONVOY IS COMMANDER DONALD MACINTYRE. MACINTYRE HAS PROVED A SHREWD HUNTER SINCE HE CAPTAINED HIS FIRST BRITISH PATROL VESSEL IN 1935. Milner: MACINTYRE WAS FOCUSED ON U-BOAT KILLING. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED TO DO. HE WANTED TO SINK SUBMARINES. Narrator: MACINTYRE TOOK COMMAND OF HMS WALKER A FEW WEEKS BEFORE- THE LEAD DESTROYER IN ONE OF BRITAIN'S FIRST DEDICATED CONVOY PROTECTION FLEETS, ESCORT GROUP 5. Sailor: HEAVE! Witt: IT WAS A VERY RISKY BUSINESS NOT ONLY TO SERVE ON A WARSHIP OR A MERCHANT VESSEL BUT ALSO TO TRAVEL THE ATLANTIC. THERE WAS ALSO THIS CONSTANT THREAT OF BEING ATTACKED BY A U-BOAT AND FACING, FACING A GRUESOME DEATH. [DIAL CLICKING] ♪ Narrator: 150 MILES SOUTH OF ICELAND... [EXPLOSION] MACINTYRE FACES THE FIRST ASSAULT AGAINST CONVOY HX 112. A U-BOAT CRIPPLES ONE OF THE CONVOY'S PRIZED OIL TANKERS. CRITICAL FUEL FOR BRITAIN'S WAR EFFORT BURNS. Grove: TANKERS ARE ALWAYS SPECTACULAR TARGETS. THEY GO UP IN HUGE BOUTS OF FLAME, AND THIS TANKER WAS NO EXCEPTION. IT MADE A GREAT IMPACT ON MACINTYRE, WHO SAID, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, IT WAS RATHER A DEPRESSING SIGHT TO SEE THIS HUGE EXPLOSION TAKING PLACE, AND IT SHOWED THAT THE U-BOATS WERE MOUNTING EFFECTIVE ATTACKS. ♪ [EXPLOSION] Narrator: IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC A U-BOAT HAS DOWNED A TANKER CARRYING FUEL GUARDED BY BRITAIN'S ESCORT GROUP 5, COMMANDED BY DONALD MACINTYRE. THE SUBMARINE THAT HAS AMBUSHED THE CONVOY IS U-110. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: AND IT TAKES IMMEDIATE EVASIVE ACTION. [SPEAKING GERMAN] ♪ Narrator: THE DIVE IS ORDERED... [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: ...BY FRITZ-JULIUS LEMP. LIKE KRETSCHMER AND SCHEPKE, LEMP IS ONE OF HITLER'S ELITE U-BOAT ACES. HE'S BEST KNOWN FOR SINKING THE PASSENGER LINER ATHENIA ON THE FIRST DAY OF WORLD WAR II. THE ATTACK ON THE CIVILIAN VESSEL SENDS THE STARK MESSAGE THAT EVERY BRITISH SHIP IS AT RISK. Grove: AT THE START OF THE WAR, THE ADMIRALTY ISN'T SURE THAT THE GERMANS ARE GOING TO START UNRESTRICTED SUBMARINE WARFARE. BUT WHEN THE ATHENIA IS SUNK, THEN THE ADMIRALTY DECIDES YES, IT IS UNRESTRICTED SUBMARINE WARFARE, AND SO A CONVOY SYSTEM IS INTRODUCED. Narrator: BEFORE DIVING, LEMP TRANSMITS THE COORDINATES OF CONVOY HX 112 TO U-BOAT HEADQUARTERS. DÖNITZ DEPLOYS KRETSCHMER AND SCHEPKE IN A WOLFPACK TO INTERCEPT. Milner: ALL THE, THE FIRST ROUND DRAFT PICKS, ALL THE KEY CHARACTERS ARE IN THIS CONVOY BATTLE. ♪ Narrator: BUT ONE OF THE CONVOY'S ESCORTS ALSO CARRIES A NEW WEAPON RIGGED TO FOIL U-BOAT TACTICS. MACINTYRE'S WARSHIP FLEET INCLUDES THE HMS VANOC, RECENTLY FITTED WITH RADAR, A TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS SHIPS TO LOCATE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE. Witt: VANOC WAS ONE OF THE FIRST DESTROYERS TO BE EQUIPPED WITH A RADAR SYSTEM, AND THIS WAS ENTIRELY NEW AND A NEW THREAT TO THE U-BOATS. NOW THEY COULD BE DETECTED AT NIGHT, AT THE SURFACE. Narrator: UNAWARE OF THIS CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT, GERMANY'S TOP SUBMARINE COMMANDERS PREPARE TO ATTACK. Grove: THEY HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESSES AGAINST POORLY ESCORTED CONVOYS. NOW THE TIDE IS BEGINNING TO TURN, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT YET. ♪ Narrator: MARCH 16, 1941. HAVING LOCATED THE CONVOY, KRETSCHMER PLOTS HIS CREEP INTO HX 112. U- 99'S COMMANDER SCANS THE FOG WITH PRIZED BINOCULARS MADE FOR AN ACE. Grove: AS AN ACE SUBMARINE COMMANDER, KRETSCHMER HAS BEEN PRESENTED WITH A RATHER HIGHER STANDARD OF BINOCULARS THAN OTHER CAPTAINS. AND THEY'RE PART OF HIS ABILITY, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT, TO SEE TARGETS ON THE SURFACE. AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF KRETSCHMER'S SELF-IMAGE THAT HE HAS THEM. Narrator: KRETSCHMER MUST USE HIS SHARP EYES TO AVOID AN ACCIDENTAL CRASH WITH AN ENEMY SHIP. Grove: THE NORTH ATLANTIC IN MARCH IS NOT A VERY HOSPITABLE PLACE, AND YOU GET MIST AND FOG AND SO ON, AND THEREFORE IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO ATTACK. BUT KRETSCHMER WAS A PERSON WHO LIKED TAKING RISK. HE WANTED TO GET INSIDE THE CONVOY. THAT WAS HIS TACTIC, GET INSIDE THE CONVOY, TARGET-RICH ENVIRONMENT, SINK EVERYTHING IN SIGHT. AND HE TRIES TO DO THIS DESPITE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS. Narrator: BY 10 P.M. U-99 NAVIGATES THE FOG TO LAND INSIDE ENEMY LINES, WHERE NONE OF THE CONVOY ESCORTS WOULD EXPECT TO FIND A NAZI SUBMARINE. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: AVOIDING UNDERWATER DETECTION AND CLOAKED IN DARKNESS, KRETSCHMER AND HIS CREW ARE READY TO STRIKE. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Grove: THEY ATTACK AT NIGHT ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE ASDIC DOESN'T WORK, THE SONAR DOESN'T WORK... [EXPLOSION] AND THEREFORE THEY CREATE CHAOS, THEY CREATE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SHOCK EFFECT, AND LARGE NUMBERS OF SHIPS THEN BLOW UP IN, IN QUICK SUCCESSION. [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [EXPLOSION] Narrator: ABOARD THE LEAD BRITISH ESCORT MACINTYRE SCANS THE PERIMETER FOR THE U-BOAT THAT'S RAVAGING HIS SHIPS. Milner: IF THE ESCORT GETS A SNIFF, IT CAN STRIKE AGAINST THE PACK. IT CAN PUSH IT OFF AND MAYBE GET THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH VERY FEW LOSSES. ♪ Narrator: BUT AT 1 A. M. ANOTHER SUBMARINE IS DETECTED. MACINTYRE SPOTS SCHEPKE IN THE CUSTOMARY POSITION OUTSIDE THE CONVOY. THE BRITISH DESTROYER STEAMS TOWARD ITS TARGET AT 34 KNOTS... [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: NEARLY TWICE AS FAST AS U-100 CAN SPEED. [SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SHOUTING] Narrator: NEARLY OVERTAKEN ON THE SURFACE, SHEPKE'S ONLY OPTION IS TO TRY AND HIDE BENEATH THE WAVES. ♪ Witt: IN SUCH A BATTLE SITUATION YOU CAN'T THINK FOR HOURS AND HOURS OVER, OVER WHAT TO DO NEXT, AND SO MADE THIS SPLIT-SECOND DECISION TO EVADE AN ATTACK BY THE DESTROYER BY DIVING. Sailor: LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO. Narrator: MACINTYRE SUMMONS HMS VANOC TO JOIN HIM IN A DEPTH CHARGE ATTACK. Sailor #1: COME ON, BOYS, LET'S GO. Sailor #2: SAILORS CLEAR! Grove: DEPTH CHARGES ARE VERY LARGE EXPLOSIONS. [BOOM] AND IF THEY OCCUR CLOSE TO THE SUBMARINE, THEN THEY DO A LOT OF DAMAGE. [EXPLOSIONS] Witt: WALLS BECOME UNTIED. WATER LEAKS IN. CONTROLS BURST, BULBS BURST. ALL KINDS OF DAMAGES ARE INFLICTED. [SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [EXPLOSIONS] Narrator: THE DAMAGE IS OVERWHELMING. Grove: IT LEAKS SO BADLY THAT IF IT DOESN'T COME UP, IT'S PROBABLY GONNA SINK. Narrator: ON MACINTYRE'S SHIP, HMS WALKER, THE SONAR OPERATOR STRUGGLES TO PING U-100 WITH THE ASDIC SYSTEM IN AN OCEAN DISTORTED BY EXPLOSIONS. Grove: THE SEA IS A VERY COMPLICATED ENVIRONMENT. AND OF COURSE IF YOU'RE DROPPING DEPTH CHARGES, IT'S- IT'S QUITE HARD TO ACTUALLY SEPARATE THE DEPTH CHARGES FROM THE SUBMARINE. ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS AN ASDIC FACED FORWARDS, AND YOUR WEAPONS WERE DROPPED OVER THE STERN, THE REAR OF THE SHIP. SO THIS MEANS THAT WHEN YOU'RE ATTACKING A SUBMARINE, THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN YOUR LOSING CONTACT AND THE DEPTH CHARGES ACTUALLY BEING DROPPED, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO REACQUIRE THE TARGET. Narrator: NEARBY, HMS VANOC USES ITS FIRST-GENERATION RADAR TO SCAN FOR U-100 IN CASE IT SURFACES. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY COULD DELIVER A TARGET, BUT ITS APPLICATION IS LIMITED. Milner: THE FIRST RADAR THEY PUT IN SERVICE IS THE TYPE 286, WHICH IS A 1.5-METER RADAR, FIXED TO THE MASTHEAD. THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WITH TYPE 286 RADAR IS THE TARGET HAD TO BE STRAIGHT AHEAD. YOU COULDN'T TURN THE ANTENNA, SO YOU HAD TO POINT THE SHIP. Narrator: JUST AFTER 3:00 A. M., SCHEPKE POPS UP A THOUSAND YARDS AWAY FROM THE ESCORTS, BETTING HE CAN REPAIR THE FLOODING AND LIMP AWAY TO SAFETY. IN AN INCREDIBLE TWIST... Controller: CONTACT DEAD AHEAD. Narrator: ...HE LANDS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE FIRST RADAR SYSTEM, ABLE TO DETECT HIM. Milner: IF THEY'D BEEN A LITTLE BIT LEFT OR RIGHT OR SOME OTHER PLACE, THE 286 ON THE MASTHEAD PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE PICKED IT UP. Narrator: VANOC RACES HEAD ON. Witt: THE COMMANDER DECIDES TO RAM THE U-BOAT. [SPEAKING GERMAN] ♪ Narrator: HAVING PICKED UP A SURFACED U-BOAT ON ITS NEWLY INSTALLED RADAR SYSTEM, THE BRITISH SHIP VANOC RESORTS TO A STANDARD FIRST WORLD WAR TACTIC AND CHARGES TO RAM THE DAMAGED SUBMARINE. ♪ [CRASH] Witt: THE DESTROYER HITS THE U-BOAT U-100 AMIDSHIPS AND SMASHES THE CONNING TOWER, AND SCHEPKE IS CRUSHED WITH HIS LEGS BETWEEN THE HULL AND THE PERISCOPE, IS THROWN INTO THE WATER AND IS KILLED, AND THE U-BOAT IS LOST. ♪ Narrator: ABOARD U-99, KRETSCHMER IS OBLIVIOUS TO THE FATE OF HIS FELLOW ACE. OUT OF TORPEDOES, U- 99'S CREW CLEARS THE CONVOY TO HEAD FOR HOME. Grove: THIS IS A CLASSIC KRETSCHMER ATTACK, FIVE SHIPS SUNK, SO HE SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL. BUT NOW THE TRAINING OF THE ESCORT FORCE COMES IN. THEY CARRY OUT WHAT THEY CAN OF A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH. Narrator: AS U-99 SLINKS AWAY, KRETSCHMER'S LOOKOUT SPOTS MACINTYRE'S DESTROYER. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: IN A PANIC THE CREWMAN IS CONVINCED THEY'VE BEEN DISCOVERED. [SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [BELL RINGS] Narrator: ON THE CREWMAN'S WARNING, THE SUBMARINE DIVES. Witt: WHEN HE SAW THIS DESTROYER EXTREMELY NEAR, HE SIMPLY EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED BY THE DESTROYER, AND SO MADE THIS SPLIT-SECOND DECISION TO EVADE AN ATTACK BY THE DESTROYER BY DIVING. Narrator: MACINTYRE'S LOOKOUTS WERE UNAWARE OF U-99. BUT AS THE SUBMARINE DESCENDS, THE DESTROYER'S SONAR COMES INTO PLAY. Milner: THEY'RE LISTENING ALL THE TIME, AND THEY'RE PLAYING THIS KIND OF DEADLY GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE. THE SUB'S DOWN HERE, AND HE'S LISTENING TO YOU PING OFF HIM. AND AT SOME POINT, BECAUSE THE SONAR BEAM IS FIXED, IT'S GONNA SWEEP OVER THE SUB. Operator: NEW CONTACT. RANGE, 400 YARDS. Grove: ONCE IT CAN BE PICKED UP ON ASDIC, IT CAN BE ATTACKED WITH DEPTH CHARGES. Narrator: MACINTYRE'S CREW LAUNCHES ITS UNDERWATER BOMBS... Sailor: LET'S GO, LET'S GO! Narrator: ...IN A BID TO SINK THE SUBMARINE. ♪ [BOOM] [EXPLOSIONS] Witt: THEY THREW THE DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY DETONATED NEAR THE U-BOAT, CAUSING EXTREME DAMAGE. [EXPLOSIONS] [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: WITH CONTROLS FAILING, THEIR EQUIPMENT AND GAUGES SHATTERED, KRETSCHMER AND HIS CREW PLUNGE TOWARDS THE SEAFLOOR IN A SEVERELY WOUNDED SUBMARINE. Milner: THEY HAD TWO OPTIONS AT THAT POINT. YOU CAN BLOW BALLAST AND GET OUT OR YOU BECOME A BOTTOM FEATURE. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: KRETSCHMER'S CREW ATTEMPTS TO BLOW OUT WATER TO RAISE THEIR PLUMMETING U-BOAT. Witt: THE ONLY WAY OF ESCAPING WAS RETURNING TO THE SURFACE, SO THIS WAS THE DECISION KRETSCHMER MADE SIMPLY TO SAVE THE LIFE OF HIS CREW. Narrator: BUT THE AIR VALVE IS JAMMED. Grove: HE'S FORCED DOWN. IN FACT, HE GOES DOWN VERY DEEP INDEED. IT LOOKS AS IF THE SUBMARINE IS GONNA BE CRUSHED. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: THE CREW MONITORS THEIR DESCENT. Narrator: TO THEIR HORROR, THEY DROP DEEPER AND DEEPER. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Narrator: TWENTY FEET BELOW CRUSH DEPTH... Narrator: ...THE VALVE FINALLY GIVES. Narrator: THE U-BOAT BEGINS TO CLIMB. Narrator: ON THE SURFACE, A DETERMINED MACINTYRE WAITS FOR THE SUBMARINE. ♪ Grove: AS SOON AS SHE SURFACES, SHE'S ENGAGED WITH GUNFIRE. [GUNFIRE] A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DAMAGE IS INFLICTED, AND IT SEEMS AS IF THE TIME HAS COME FOR U-99 TO BE ABANDONED. Narrator: BUT FROM THE SINKING SUBMARINE, HITLER'S TOP U-BOAT ACE ORDERS A FINAL TRANSMISSION. Witt: AFTER HIS LUCK HAS RUN OUT, KRETSCHMER STILL IS THIS PROFESSIONAL. HE SENDS A LAST MESSAGE TO DÖNITZ, VERY SHORT, SIMPLY SAYS DEPTH CHARGE, TWO DESTROYERS, 53,000 TONS, KRETSCHMER. Milner: THAT LAST MESSAGE HE SENDS FROM THE SUBMARINE, I'VE SUNK A NUMBER OF SHIPS, SOME ODD THOUSAND TONS, LEAVING THE SUB, KRETSCHMER. UM, THAT, THAT'S JUST AN INDICATION OF WHAT A COOL CUSTOMER HE ACTUALLY WAS. Narrator: MORE THAN FIVE HOURS AFTER U-99 LAUNCHED ITS ATTACK, KRETSCHMER ORDERS HIS CREW ON DECK TO PREPARE FOR SURRENDER. Grove: KRETSCHMER, I THINK TO CALM HIS CREW, LIGHTS A CIGAR, JUST TO SHOW THAT HE'S STILL IN, IN CHARGE. HE SIGNALS TO THE BRITISH TO TAKE OFF HIS CREW. AND THE BRITISH WILL DO THAT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T MUCH HATRED MAN, MAN TO MAN. ONCE THE SUBMARINE'S SUNK, THAT'S THE JOB DONE. Narrator: KRETSCHMER IS THE LAST ONE PULLED ABOARD THE BRITISH DESTROYER. MACINTYRE CLAIMS THE ACE'S BINOCULARS AS HIS PRIZE. Grove: KRETSCHMER IS TREATED VERY WELL ON BOARD HMS WALKER. HE PLAYS BRIDGE, HE'S PLIED WITH WHISKEY. THEY'RE VERY, UH, UH, PLEASED THAT THEY'VE CAPTURED SOMEBODY SO DISTINGUISHED. Narrator: KRETSCHMER SPENDS THE REST OF THE WAR AS AN ALLIED PRISONER. THE BATTLE AGAINST CONVOY HX 112 COST DÖNITZ TWO OF HIS TOP SUBMARINES. Milner: WHEN KRETSCHMER AND SCHEPKE GO DOWN IN MARCH OF '41, THAT'S A CATASTROPHIC DEVELOPMENT FOR GERMAN PUBLIC RELATIONS. YOU'VE TRUMPETED THE SUCCESS OF THESE HEROES, AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE GONE. AND THE FLIPSIDE OF THAT IS THAT THE BRITS ACTUALLY APPEAR TO BE GIANT KILLERS 'CAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN THEM OUT. IT'S TRAGIC THAT THEY LOSE THEM ALL IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. BUT YOU'VE STILL GOT LOTS OF YOUNG, VERY CAPABLE SUBMARINERS COMING ALONG. THE GERMAN SUBMARINE FLEET IS BY NO MEANS DONE. IT'S REALLY JUST GETTING STARTED. ♪
