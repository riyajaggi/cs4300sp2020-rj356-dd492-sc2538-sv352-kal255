 BRITISH SUBMARINES MUST HOLD THE LINE. STAND BY ALL TUBES. THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER. FIRE. IN WORLD WAR II, A SUBSEA WEAPON ALLOWS WARRIORS TO FIGHT FROM BENEATH THE WAVES. WITH CUNNING, FORCE AND TENACITY, THEIR ENEMIES STRIKE BACK. REVOLUTIONARY BUT STILL SOMETIMES PRIMITIVE, IT'S A DESPERATE BID TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WAR. THEIR STORIES ARE LEGEND. MAY 24, 1941. 11 MILES OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN ITALY. CREW OF BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS UPHOLDER

 SPOTS AN INDISTINCT SHAPE. THE DARKENING NIGHT AND STORMY SEAS MAKE PERISCOPE OBSERVATION DIFFICULT. CAPTAIN. THE SUBMARINE'S CAPTAIN, LIEUTENANT COMMANDER MALCOLM WANKLYN, TAKES A CLOSER LOOK. WANKLYN JOINED THE ROYAL NAVY AS A TEENAGER AND BEGAN TO SERVE ABOARD SUBMARINES IN 1933. WANKLYN IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE GREATEST SUBMARINE ACE IN THE ROYAL NAVY'S HISTORY. HE'S A VERY ABLE OFFICER. HE'S VERY THOUGHTFUL. AND HE CERTAINLY HAD THE TRUST OF HIS CREW AND THE TRUST OF HIS SUPERIORS. AND EVEN WHEN HE'S NOT DOING AS WELL AS HE MIGHT HOPE, NONETHELESS HE'S KEPT THERE, AND EVENTUALLY HE COMES GOOD. THIS MIGHT JUST BE HIS CHANCE. THE DARK SHAPE IS A LARGE CONVOY OF ITALIAN SHIPS, MAKING THEIR WAY TO NORTH AFRICA. AT LEAST FOUR DESTROYERS PROTECT FOUR TROOP LINERS. RANGE 2,200 YARDS! BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT; AFTER TEN DAYS ON PATROL, UPHOLDER HAS ONLY TWO TORPEDOES LEFT. EVEN WORSE, THE SUBMARINE HAS LOST USE OF IMPORTANT EQUIPMENT. SALT WATER HAS DAMAGED THEIR ASDIC, OR SONAR, SYSTEM. ACTIVE SONAR IS A WAY TO LOCATE OBJECTS UNDERWATER WITH PINGS. PASSIVE SONAR MEANS LISTENING FOR THE SOUNDS MADE BY OTHER SHIPS. BY USING ASDIC YOU GET TO HEAR THE ENEMY APPROACHING, NOW, THAT'S GOOD IN OFFENSIVE TERMS. YOU KNOW WHERE THE ENEMY IS AND CAN MOVE TOWARDS THEM. IT'S ALSO GOOD IN DEFENSIVE TERMS, YOU KNOW WHEN THE ENEMY IS COMING TOWARDS YOU. ONCE YOU'VE LOST ASDIC, THEN YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE EYE CONTACT. THIS REQUIRES FREQUENT CHECKS WITH THE PERISCOPE, WHICH MEANS THE SUBMARINE ITSELF CAN ALSO BE SEEN. WITH THE TORPEDO TUBES LOADED, WANKLYN PREPARES FOR AN ATTACK. DOWN PERISCOPE. IT'S QUITE A STRAIGHTFORWARD PLAN. HE'S GOT TO PENETRATE THE ESCORT. GET CLOSE, GET IN AND HIT HARD AND GET OUT AGAIN. WANKLYN'S FAILURE HERE COULD LEAD TO THE ALLIES' COLLAPSE IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THEATERS OF THE WAR: THE NORTH AFRICAN FRONT. THE WAR IN NORTH AFRICA BEGAN AS AN ITALIAN CAMPAIGN. THE GERMANS ARE DRAGGED IN BY ITALIAN DEFEAT IN AUTUMN AND WINTER 1940 AND '41. WITH THE SUCCESS OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH FORCES, CHURCHILL WAS SO CONFIDENT HE COULD DEFEAT THE ITALIANS THAT HE REDEPLOYED BRITISH SOLDIERS TO GREECE. HIS OVERCONFIDENCE PROVES COSTLY. AROUND THE SAME TIME IN FEBRUARY, HITLER DECIDES TO DEFEND NAZI GERMANY'S AXIS ALLIANCE WITH ITALY. HE SENDS WHAT WOULD BECOME THE INFAMOUS DEUTSCHES AFRIKA KORPS TO THE REGION. THE GERMAN OFFICER ASSUMES COMMAND: GENERALLEUTNANT ERWIN ROMMEL. ROMMEL AND HIS CORPS DRIVE RAPIDLY TO THE EAST, SEIZING BRITISH-HELD TERRITORY AND PUSHING ALLIED FORCES BACK TOWARD THEIR BASES IN EGYPT. IF ROMMEL TAKES EGYPT, THE NAZIS WOULD CONTROL THE SUEZ CANAL. IT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE ALLIES. BRITAIN WILL BE CUT OFF ITS VITAL SUPPLIES FROM THE CROWN COLONY OF INDIA AND FROM THE OIL RESERVES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. ON APRIL 10th, ROMMEL ATTACKS THE KEY PORT CITY OF TOBRUK, ABOUT 90 MILES FROM THE EGYPTIAN BORDER. THE ITALIANS AND THE GERMANS HAVE GOT THE PROBLEM IN NORTH AFRICA THAT THEIR SUPPLIES GO THROUGH TRIPOLIS, WHICH IS HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS TO THE WEST. SO TOBRUK WOULD BE VITAL TO GET THE REINFORCEMENTS AND THE SUPPLIES QUICKER TO THE FRONTLINE. ROMMEL TRIES TO TAKE TOBRUK WHILE HOPING TO PRESS FARTHER INTO BRITISH TERRITORY. HE SENDS IN HIS TROOPS PIECEMEAL AND IS NOT SUCCESSFUL. HE HAS TO LEAVE A SIEGING FORCE BEHIND, AND PARTS OF HIS FORCES ARE SENT TO THE EGYPTIAN BORDER. ROMMEL BELIEVES IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE CITY FALLS. AND IF TOBRUK FALLS, EGYPT WILL BE NEXT. TO STALL THE AXIS OFFENSIVE, THE ALLIES MUST CUT OFF SUPPLIES AND REINFORCEMENTS. THE ALLIES' BEST HOPE IS NOW A TINY ISLAND ALONG THE SHIPPING ROUTE BETWEEN ITALY AND NORTH AFRICA: MALTA. MALTA IS HOME TO A BRITISH SUBMARINE BASE, WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF U-CLASS SUBMARINES. THE TRADITION IN BRITISH FLOTILLA CRAFT, LIKE SUBMARINES, IS TO HAVE ALL SUBMARINES STARTING WITH THE SAME LETTER. SO WE HAVE UNDAUNTED, UNBEATEN, AND UPHOLDER. THE SMALL SIZE AND MANEUVERABILITY OF THE U-CLASS PROVE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN LARGE SUBMARINES IN THE CONFINED WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. BRITISH SUBMARINES NEED TO SINK ITALIAN MERCHANT SHIPPING CARRYING SUPPLIES, MEN AND ARMAMENTS TO ROMMEL'S ARMIES. BUT THE CREWS IN MALTA PROVE VULNERABLE. MALTA SUFFERS HEAVY AIR ATTACKS. ITS FIGHTER DEFENSES ARE NOT VERY GOOD. AND THEREFORE, GETTING SUPPLIES TO MALTA, LIVING AT MALTA, OPERATING SUBMARINES OUT OF MALTA OR ANY ASSET OUT OF MALTA CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. THE BRITISH SUBMARINE FORCE NEEDS TO SINK SHIPS AND HELP TURN THE TIDE OF WAR. UP PERISCOPE. WANKLYN APPROACHES THE DESTROYERS WHICH PROTECT THE TROOPSHIP CONVOY. TARGET BEARING 2-8-5, RANGE 2,200 YARDS. UPHOLDER MANEUVERS INTO POSITION. THEY'RE JUST OUTSIDE THE ITALIAN CONVOY'S SCREEN OF ESCORT SHIPS. AS HE'S LINING UP FOR AN ATTACK ON THE CONVOY, LO AND BEHOLD, 400 YARDS AHEAD OF HIM AN ITALIAN DESTROYER IS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM. DOWN PERISCOPE. WANKLYN'S IMMEDIATE REACTION IS TO CRASH DIVE AND GET DOWN TO 150 FEET. BECAUSE WHAT HE THINKS IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS HE'S GOING TO BE DEPTH-CHARGED. BUT THE DESTROYER'S ONLY ON A ROUTINE SWEEP... AND UNAWARE THAT AN ENEMY SUBMARINE HAS PENETRATED THEIR CONVOY. UP PERISCOPE. NOW INSIDE THE ESCORT SCREEN, UPHOLDER NEEDS TO ACT FAST. WANKLYN SETS UP A CLEAR SHOT ON A MASSIVE TROOPSHIP. STAND BY TUBES ONE AND FOUR. WITH HIS LAST TWO TORPEDOES READY, HE DOESN'T HESITATE. FIRE ONE! FIRE ONE! FIRE FOUR! FIRE FOUR! WANKLYN'S LAST TWO TORPEDOES HURTLE TOWARDS THE TARGET. THEIR DISTINCTIVE TRAIL IS SPOTTED ON THE SURFACE BY A LOOKOUT ON ONE OF THE SHIPS. WHEN THE ESCORT SIGHTS THE TORPEDOES, THE FIRST THING HE MUST DO IS FIRE A FLARE TO ALERT THE COMMANDER OF THE CONVOY. THIS ENABLES THE CONVOY COMMANDER TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BUT IT'S TOO LATE TO SAVE THE CONTE ROSSO. BOTH TORPEDOES HIT THE 17,800-TON TROOPSHIP. SHE QUICKLY STARTS TO SINK AND TAKES NEARLY HALF OF THE 3,000 SOLDIERS AND CREW DOWN WITH HER. THE DESTROYERS BEGIN A SEARCH FOR THE SUBMARINE. DOWN PERISCOPE. THEY FOLLOW THE TORPEDOES' TRACK TO THE SUBMARINE'S POSITION. THE CONVOY'S ESCORTS NOW CLOSE IN ON HMS UPHOLDER AND PREPARE A COUNTER ATTACK. MAY 1941. BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS UPHOLDER HAS JUST SUNK THE ITALIAN TROOPSHIP CONTE ROSSO. THE SUB'S CAPTAIN, LIEUTENANT COMMANDER MALCOLM WANKLYN, FIRED HIS LAST TWO TORPEDOES INTO THE LINER. THEIR TRAIL IN THE WATER LEADS THE DESTROYERS PROTECTING THE CONVOY DIRECTLY TO THEIR POSITION. THE DESTROYERS TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO FIND AND SINK UPHOLDER. WITH NO REMAINING TORPEDOES, UPHOLDER CANNOT DEFEND ITSELF. ITS DAMAGED ASDIC, OR SONAR, MEANS THE CREW HAS LOST ITS ABILITY TO LISTEN AND LOCATE THE ENEMY. WANKLYN MUST RELY ON HIS INSTINCT TO OUTMANEUVER THE DESTROYERS NOW HUNTING FOR HIM. KEEP 150 FEET! WANKLYN'S BEST CHANCE IS TO ESCAPE. BUT HE'S LIMITED BY HIS SUBMARINE. SUBMARINES OF THIS PERIOD ARE VERY SLOW UNDERWATER. AND THE U-CLASS WERE SLOW EVEN BY CONTEMPORARY SUBMARINE STANDARDS. THIS IS WHY IT'S VERY USEFUL IF YOU'RE BEING ATTACKED TO KNOW WHERE THE ENEMY IS, SO YOU CAN TAKE AVOIDING ACTION, USING WHAT LIMITED MOBILITY YOU'VE GOT. THE SOUND OF THE DESTROYERS' PROPELLERS GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER... UNTIL THEY'RE RIGHT OVERHEAD. ALL UPHOLDER'S CREW CAN DO IS WAIT FOR THE ATTACK. DEPTH CHARGES BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN AROUND THE SUBMARINE. SITTING ON A SUBMARINE UNDER ATTACK IS PROBABLY THE MOST TERRIFYING THING YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE. UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL EXCEPT SIT. ATTACK FOLLOWS ATTACK... STARBOARD 30. WANKLYN CONTINUES TO ORDER COURSE AND SPEED CHANGES. KEEP 70 FEET. BEING UNPREDICTABLE MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE DESTROYERS TO TRACK THE SUBMARINE. ANOTHER TURN. VERY LITTLE SEPARATES THE CREW FROM THE EXPLOSIONS OUTSIDE. WHEN YOU'RE IN A TUBE, WHICH IS NO BIGGER THAN SAY A LONDON TUBE TRAIN, AND THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS GOING ON AROUND, THE EXPLOSIONS HAVE THE EFFECT OF INFLICTING DAMAGE ON THE INSIDES OF THE SUBMARINE. IT IS A VERY NERVE-RACKING EXPERIENCE INDEED. AS THE TENSION BUILDS, ONE YOUNG SUBMARINER STARTS TO LOSE CONTROL OF HIS FEAR. THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE, SADLY, NO FAULT OF THEIRS, WHO CRACK UNDER THE STRAIN. THE CREWMEMBER IS DESPERATE TO ESCAPE THE CONFINES OF THE SUBMARINE AND THE NOISE. HE TRIES TO CLIMB UP THE LADDER TO GET AWAY. THE DANGER IS NOT THAT HE CAN OPEN THE HATCH; THE WATER PRESSURE AT THIS DEPTH IS ENORMOUS. BUT HIS FEAR THREATENS THE SUBMARINE AND ITS CREW. IF SOMEONE CRACKS IN THE SUBMARINE, PARTICULARLY A SMALL SUBMARINE, IT CAN GET VERY CONTAGIOUS. IT CAN ACTUALLY SPREAD. AND THEREFORE IF SOMEBODY PANICS, IT CAN HAVE VERY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON MORALE. EVEN WORSE, IT COULD UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN THE CAPTAIN AND HIS ORDERS. THE PANICKED SAILOR IS REMOVED FROM HARM'S WAY. HE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PHYSICALLY SUBDUED. AND IT WAS UP TO SIMPSON, THE COMMANDER OF THE SUBMARINE FORCE, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. WANKLYN SEEMS TO HAVE RECOMMENDED HE BE TAKEN OFF SUBMARINES, AND HE WAS TAKEN OFF SUBMARINES AND RETURNED TO GENERAL SERVICE. SLOW AHEAD BOTH. WANKLYN CONTINUES TO GIVE COURSE ALTERATIONS TO ESCAPE THE ITALIAN DESTROYERS OVERHEAD. KEEP 100 FEET, FULL AHEAD BOTH. BUT ONE DEPTH CHARGE COMES TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. THEN ANOTHER. WHEN IT IS INCREDIBLY CLOSE, IT CAN BE SHATTERING GLASS, IT CAN BE SHATTERING GAUGES, IT CAN BE ALL KINDS OF THINGS. KEEP 150 FEET! ONE MORE DEPTH CHARGE EXPLODES... BUT THEN... THE EXPLOSIONS STOP. THE CREW LATER REPORTS AN AWFUL CREAKING NOISE, LIKE THE SCRAPING OF WIRE ALONG THE HULL. AS THEY FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY, WANKLYN TAKES TIME TO ASSURE HIS CREW. ONE OF THE THINGS HE DOES IS GIVE A RUNNING COMMENTARY OF THE NOISES THAT ARE GOING ON OUTSIDE. SO HE'S GIVING THE CREW CONFIDENCE. IT IS THE FATE OF THE CONTE ROSSO THAT THEY CAN HEAR, NOT A COMING FATE FOR THEM. TWO HOURS LATER, UPHOLDER FINALLY BREAKS THE SURFACE. THE DESTROYERS ARE GONE. WANKLYN'S RISK PAYS OFF BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO THEY SINK THE CONTE ROSSO AND THE TROOPS IT'S CARRYING, BUT ALSO DELAY THE ARRIVAL OF FURTHER REINFORCEMENTS TO ROMMEL IN NORTH AFRICA. THE CONTE ROSSO SINKING IS A MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE MALTA SUBMARINES. IT'S THE MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT. IT'S THE BIGGEST SHIP SUNK. AND THE FACT THAT HE DOES IT WITHOUT ALL HIS EQUIPMENT, THE FACT THAT HE IS WILLING TO TAKE SUCH RISKS, MEANS THAT HE HAS BECOME YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY THE BEST SYMBOL OF THE MALTA SUBMARINE. TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS ACHIEVEMENT, WANKLYN IS LATER AWARDED THE VICTORIA CROSS FOR GALLANTRY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ENEMY. IT'S THE HIGHEST AWARD POSSIBLE FOR A MEMBER OF THE BRITISH ARMED FORCES. IN MAY 1941, OUT OF TORPEDOES AND IN NEED OF REPAIRS, BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS UPHOLDER RETURNS TO MALTA. BUT EVEN IN PORT, THERE IS LITTLE REST FOR THE CREW. SO CLOSE TO ITALY, THE ISLAND IS AN EASY TARGET FOR GERMAN BOMBERS. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT EVEN WHEN YOU COME BACK TO BASE, YOU'RE UNDER ATTACK. YOU MIGHT IN FACT HAVE TO SUBMERGE YOUR SUBMARINE SO IT WILL NOT BE SUNK. THEREFORE YOU COME BACK TO HARBOR AND YOU STAY IN THE SUBMARINE. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERYWHERE. IN FACT, IT ONLY HAPPENS IN MALTA. SO THE STRESSES ARE SO MUCH GREATER. THERE'S NO SAFETY IN HARBOR. IT'S AS DANGEROUS IN HARBOR AS IT IS AT SEA. MALTA REMAINS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO PROTECT BRITISH INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA. MALTA IS AN ISLAND, AND MALTA CAN ALSO BE CONSIDERED AS AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER. THEY CAN USE IT FOR THEIR AIRCRAFT TO SINK THE AXIS SHIPS FROM THE AIR, OR ALSO TO USE IT AS A SUBMARINE OR AS NAVAL BASES. MALTA IS VERY CLOSE TO ITALY. SO MUCH SO IN FACT THAT IT'S THOUGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR THAT MALTA IS UNSUSTAINABLE. SUPPLYING IT IS VERY DIFFICULT, BOTH FROM WEST AND EAST. LONG MARITIME SUPPLY LINES, LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHIPS TO BE SUNK. AND IN FACT, ONE REASON THE GERMANS DON'T TAKE MALTA IS BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT SUPPLYING IT THEMSELVES. BUT DURING THE SUMMER OF 1941, THE SITUATION CHANGES AS HITLER INVADES THE SOVIET UNION. THE FIRST AIR SIEGE, SO CALLED, COMES TO AN END IN THE SUMMER OF 1941 BECAUSE THE GERMAN AIRCRAFT ARE CALLED AWAY TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN IN RUSSIA. AND THIS MEANS THAT THE SECOND HALF OF 1941 IS RELATIVELY QUIET IN MALTA. AND THIS ALLOWS NOT JUST THE SUBMARINES TO OPERATE MORE EASILY BUT EVEN ALLOWS THE OPERATION OF SURFACE FORCES. THE MALTA-BASED ALLIES SOON GAIN ANOTHER ADVANTAGE. IN JUNE 1941, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE BREAKS THE ITALIAN NAVAL CODE. NOW THE BRITISH KNOW WHEN THE ITALIAN SHIPS WILL SAIL. ROMMEL, THOUGH, REMAINS DEFIANT. IN SUMMER 1941, ROMMEL HAS ALREADY BEATEN BACK TWO BRITISH COUNTERATTACKS TO RELIEVE THE SIEGE OF TOBRUK. AND ROMMEL SHOWS THAT HE IS QUITE CAPABLE. AND THIS MEANS HE'S STILL A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. THE BRITISH SUBMARINES NEED TO PRESS HOME THEIR ADVANTAGE AND CUT OFF ROMMEL'S SUPPLY LINES ONCE AND FOR ALL. IN AUGUST 1941, THE TENTH FLOTILLA RECEIVES INTELLIGENCE THAT AN IMPORTANT SHIPMENT OF TROOPS IS ABOUT TO LEAVE MESSINA FOR TRIPOLI. HMS UPHOLDER DEPARTS MALTA IN PURSUIT, FOR HER 13th WAR PATROL IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. AFTER TWO DAYS, WANKLYN SPOTS NINE SHIPS. SIX DESTROYERS PROTECT THREE ITALIAN TROOP TRANSPORTS: NEPTUNIA, OCEANIA AND MARCO POLO. BUT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN UPHOLDER AND THE CONVOY IS GREAT. WANKLYN WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THE GAP- BUT TROOPSHIPS HAVE A TOP SPEED OF 19.5 KNOTS. THE SUBMARINE CANNOT KEEP UP. IT CAN ONLY DO ABOUT 12.5 KNOTS ON THE SURFACE, WHICH ISN'T FAST BY SUBMARINE STANDARDS, EVEN AT THAT TIME. THE CONVOY REPEATEDLY CHANGES COURSE AND ZIGZAGS FARTHER AWAY. COME ON, LET'S GO. WITH HIS TORPEDOES LOADED AND READY, WANKLYN MAKES THE QUICK DECISION TO FIRE. THEY ESTIMATE THE SHIPS TO BE 6,000 TO 7,000 YARDS AWAY. IT WILL BE A LONG SHOT, BUT HE'S GOT NOTHING TO LOSE. WANKLYN MUST FIRE BEFORE THE CONVOY GETS COMPLETELY OUT OF RANGE. STAND BY ALL TUBES. FIRE! WANKLYN FIRES FOUR TORPEDOES AT THE DISTANT CONVOY. BUT NOT ONE FINDS ITS TARGET. WHEN WANKLYN HAD FIRED HIS FOUR TORPEDOES AT THE CONVOY, HE'S VERY MUCH EXPOSED. THE SEA IS VERY CALM, IT'S DAYLIGHT. VERY QUICKLY THEN THE ITALIAN ESCORTS ARE ABLE TO FOCUS IN ON WHERE THOSE TORPEDOES CAME FROM. TWO ESCORTS GIVE CHASE; UPHOLDER HAS GONE FROM PREDATOR TO PREY. DOWN PERISCOPE. AUGUST 1941. IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, THE BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS UPHOLDER IS UNDER ATTACK FROM ITALIAN CONVOY ESCORTS. BUT THIS TIME, WANKLYN HAS THE HELP OF THE ROYAL NAVY'S VERSION OF SONAR, CALLED ASDIC. THE CREW CAN USE PASSIVE SONAR TO LISTEN TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE ESCORTS, THEN DODGE THE DEPTH CHARGES. UPHOLDER ENDURES 25 DEPTH CHARGES FOR 14 MINUTES. THREE UP, KEEP 70 FEET. BUT WANKLYN AVOIDS EVERY ONE. AND IN THE CONFUSION, UPHOLDER MANAGES TO ESCAPE. UNHINDERED, THE OTHER ENEMY SHIPS CONTINUE THEIR SWIFT VOYAGE TO NORTH AFRICA. EARLY SEPTEMBER 1941. FOR NEARLY FIVE MONTHS, ALLIED TROOPS IN TOBRUK HAVE CONTINUED TO HOLD OUT AGAINST ROMMEL'S FORCES. BUT WITH NEW AXIS REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVING, ROMMEL PUSHES THE ALLIES TO THE BREAKING POINT. SO WHEN ROMMEL WANTS TO TAKE TOBRUK BY STORM, HE THROWS IN EVERYTHING HE HAS. SO HE THROWS IN HIS TANKS, HIS ASSAULT GUNS, AND STUKAS DIVE BOMBERS. SO FOR THE ALLIED SOLDIERS IN TOBRUK IN 1941, IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE. HITLER ORDERS SIX U-BOATS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN TO CUT OFF SUPPLIES TO ALLIED FORCES. THE BRITISH FEAR THEIR WAR IN NORTH AFRICA WILL SOON BE OVER, AND THEIR SUPPLY OF MIDDLE EASTERN OIL WILL BE LOST TO THE GERMANS. THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE IS THE MALTA SUBMARINE FLEET. SEPTEMBER 1941. THE COMMANDER OF MALTA'S SUBMARINE FLOTILLA, CAPTAIN GEORGE SIMPSON, GETS A HIGHLY CLASSIFIED MESSAGE, BASED ON ULTRA DECRYPTS. A FAST CONVOY OF THREE OF THE ENEMY'S LARGEST LINERS- NEPTUNIA, OCEANIA, AND VULCANIA- ARE ONCE AGAIN ON THEIR WAY FROM ITALY TO TRIPOLI. SIMPSON HAS TO ACT NOW. IT'S A FAST-MOVING CONVOY, AND IF HE HESITATES, THE SHIPS WILL GET PAST THEM. HE COMES UP WITH A DARING PLAN. THE SIMPSON PLAN IS REMINISCENT OF WHAT THE GERMANS DO IN THE ATLANTIC, AND IT'S TO FORM A PATROL LINE OF BOATS ABOUT A DOZEN MILES APART TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOY. AND THEN WHEN THE CONVOY IS SIGHTED, THE BOATS CAN CONCENTRATE AGAINST IT. BUT AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE, HE NEEDS VOLUNTEERS. WHEN CAPTAIN SIMPSON CALLED THE MEETING, ALL SUBMARINE CREWS ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL THE STRESS. AND AT THAT TIME, ONE OF THE COMMANDERS THINKS THAT SIMPSON'S PLAN IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS IT SHOULD BE. WANKLYN, ON THE OTHER HAND, UNDERSTANDS THE POSITION, AND HE MAKES SURE THAT HIS CREW UNDERSTANDS THE POSITION. THEY MAY BE BECOMING TIRED, BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY INTERCEPT THESE CONVOYS. MEN, WE ARE OFF ON A PATROL. DESPITE THE DEMANDS OF NEAR CONSTANT PATROLS, WANKLYN AGREES TO MAKE THE RUN. SIMPSON GETS THREE MORE CREWS, AND SOON AFTER, FOUR BRITISH SUBMARINES- UPHOLDER, UPRIGHT, URSULA AND UNBEATEN- DEPART MALTA. BY MIDNIGHT, SEPTEMBER 17th, EACH OF THE SUBMARINES HAVE MOVED INTO PLACE. THE WEATHER DOESN'T HELP. THE SEAS ARE WILD; UPHOLDER LURCHES AND ROLLS IN THE SWELLS. HEY, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. EVEN WORSE, THE SUBMARINE'S GYROCOMPASS IS NOT WORKING. THIS MEANS THEIR NAVIGATION DEPENDS ON THE MAGNETIC COMPASS, WHICH ORIENTS TO MAGNETIC, NOT TRUE NORTH. A GYROCOMPASS IS ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN COMPASS THAT DOESN'T HAVE SO MUCH IMPACT IN TERMS OF THE METALLIC FIELD AROUND IT. SURROUNDED BY THE STEEL OF THE SUBMARINE'S HULL, THE MAGNETIC COMPASS WILL BE MUCH LESS ACCURATE. SO WANKLYN'S IN SERIOUS TROUBLE ONCE HE'S HAVING TO RELY ON THAT UNDER WATER. AND EVEN ON THE SURFACE THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM, AS WELL. THE HELMSMAN WORKS HARD TO MAINTAIN COURSE USING THE FLICKERING NEEDLE OF THE MAGNETIC COMPASS. AFTER THREE HOURS OF STRUGGLING AGAINST THE ELEMENTS, HMS UNBEATEN, CAPTAINED BY LIEUTENANT COMMANDER EDWARD WOODWARD, SPOTS SHAPES ABOUT EIGHT MILES AWAY. WHEN ONE OF UPHOLDER'S SISTERS, UNBEATEN, SPOTS THE CONVOY, IT FOLLOWS IT, AS FAST AS IT CAN, WHICH ISN'T PERHAPS FAST ENOUGH. EVEN IF CANNOT KEEP PACE, UNBEATEN CAN WARN THE OTHERS- THE CONVOY IS HEADED RIGHT TOWARDS UPHOLDER. BUT UPHOLDER'S SUBSONIC TRANSMISSION- ITS MEANS OF RAPID COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER SUBMARINES- ISN'T WORKING. MESSAGES FROM UNBEATEN ARE NOT GETTING THROUGH. UPKEEP AND REPAIRS ARE A CONSTANT STRUGGLE AT THIS STAGE OF THE WAR. SUBMARINES ARE VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE ASSETS. THEY NEED A LOT OF ATTENTION. THEY NEED A LOT OF SUPPORT AND SPARE PARTS. AND SOMETIMES THE SPARE PART SITUATION WAS SO DIRE IN MALTA THAT BITS WILL BE TAKEN OFF ONE SUBMARINE TO BE PUT ON THE OTHER. AND THEN THAT WILL BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER SUBMARINE COMING IN, UNTIL I THINK ON ONE OCCASION, ONE SUBMARINE HAD TO GO TO SEA NOT WORKING PROPERLY BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN AT THE END OF THE LINE. SO IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT, IT'S VERY, VERY CHALLENGING. UNBEATEN ALSO ROUTES ITS MESSAGE THROUGH MALTA, BUT THIS WILL TAKE LONGER. MEANWHILE, UPHOLDER BATTLES TO MAINTAIN POSITION IN HEAVY SEAS, UNAWARE OF THE CONVOY THAT BEARS DOWN ON THEM. ABOUT 30 MINUTES LATER, UPHOLDER RECEIVES THE MESSAGE FROM MALTA. WANKLYN IMMEDIATELY JOINS HIS FIRST LIEUTENANT ON THE BRIDGE. THREE LARGE TROOP LINERS AND SIX DESTROYERS LOOM IN THE DARKNESS. THE MESSAGE HAD ARRIVED JUST IN TIME. THEY STRAIN THROUGH THE NIGHT GLASSES TO ESTIMATE THE COURSE, RANGE AND SPEED OF THE PASSING TRANSPORTS. THE SHIPS PRESS AT NEARLY TWICE THE SPEED OF UPHOLDER. WANKLYN IS UNDER INCREDIBLE PRESSURE TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING. HE'S, AFTER ALL, COMMANDING THE OVERALL OPERATION AT SEA. ONCE HE HAS THE MESSAGE THAT THE CONVOY IS THERE, HE REALIZES HE HAS NO CHANCE OF CATCHING UP WITH THE CONVOY. HE'S UNDER PRESSURE TO CREATE SOME KIND OF VICTORY. WITH THE BRITISH HOLD ON NORTH AFRICA IN THE BALANCE, THIS TIME, WANKLYN CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS. SEPTEMBER 18, 1941. AN ENEMY ITALIAN CONVOY STEAMS THROUGH ROUGH SEAS. A STALKING BRITISH SUBMARINE, HMS UPHOLDER, IS AT A GRAVE DISADVANTAGE. AS WITH UPHOLDER'S 13th PATROL, THE SUB'S CAPTAIN, LIEUTENANT COMMANDER MALCOLM WANKLYN, MUST FIRE ON A CONVOY THAT'S MOVING FAR TOO FAST FOR HIM FROM OVER THREE MILES AWAY. IN AN ODD TWIST OF FATE, THE CONVOY EVEN HAS TWO OF THE SAME ITALIAN TROOP LINERS, NEPTUNIA AND OCEANIA. SIX DESTROYERS PROTECT THE CONVOY, WEAVING IN AND OUT. ALTHOUGH WANKLYN'S AT LONG DISTANCE, HE'S IN A POSITION WHICH THE LINES OF THE CONVOY APPEAR TO OVERLAP. THAT GIVES HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A BIGGER TARGET WITH THE SPREAD OF THE TORPEDO. BUT THEY'VE GOT ANOTHER PROBLEM. WITHOUT THE GYROCOMPASS, THE SUBMARINE IS BEING NAVIGATED BY THE HELMSMAN USING MAGNETIC COMPASS, AND WITH MOVEMENT OF THE SEA, THE BOAT IS BEGINNING TO YAW FROM SIDE TO SIDE. WANKLYN MUST LINE UP HIS SHOT WITHOUT THE HELP OF BASIC INSTRUMENTS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MOVEMENT OF HIS SHIP, THE DISTANCE, AND THE SPEED OF THE CONVOY. COME ON, LET'S GO, LET'S GO! WITH TORPEDOES LOADED AND READY, HE TIMES HIS SHOTS CAREFULLY. - FIRE ONE! - FIRE ONE! WANKLYN IS USING THE YAW OF THE BOAT. SO THE FIRST TORPEDO IS RELEASED AT ONE EXTREME MOVEMENT OF THE YAW, ALLOWS THE BOAT TO SWING TO THE NEXT AREA. FIRES THE SECOND TORPEDO. - FIRE THREE! - FIRE THREE! - FIRE FOUR! - FIRE! FIRES THE THIRD AND FOURTH, AS THE BOAT YAWS BACK. ONCE THE TORPEDOES HAVE BEEN FIRED, IT'S A LONG TIME FOR ANYBODY WAITING FOR THOSE EXPLOSIONS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ALTHOUGH IT WAS PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, IT MUST HAVE SEEMED LIKE HOURS. BUT SUCCESS MEANS THEY WILL STOP FURTHER REINFORCEMENTS FROM REACHING ROMMEL IN NORTH AFRICA. AFTER A LONG WAIT, THEY HEAR AN EXPLOSION... AND THEN ANOTHER. ONE OF WANKLYN'S TORPEDOES HITS THE TROOP LINER NEPTUNIA, AND IT QUICKLY BEGINS TO SINK. CLEAR THE BRIDGE! EXPECTING RETALIATION, THE LOOKOUTS AND FIRST LIEUTENANT SCRAMBLE DOWN. WANKLYN PULLS THE HATCH SHUT OVERHEAD AS THE RUSH OF WATER COVERS THE CONNING TOWER AND THE SUBMARINE DIVES TO CONCEAL THEIR POSITION. BUT UPHOLDER HAS NOT FINISHED WITH THE CONVOY. THE CREW CONTINUES SOUTH AND DESCENDS TO 60 FEET TO RELOAD THE TORPEDO TUBES. WANKLYN RETURNS TO THE LOCATION OF HIS EARLIER SUCCESS. UP PERISCOPE. DAWN BREAKS, AND ITS LIGHT REVEALS THE AFTERMATH OF UPHOLDER'S ATTACK. ONE TROOPSHIP, VULCANIA, SAILS AWAY ESCORTED BY A DESTROYER. THE SECOND, NEPTUNIA, HAS DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES. THE THIRD, OCEANIA, HAS STOPPED DEAD IN THE WATER. TWO DESTROYERS HOVER CLOSE BY TO RESCUE SURVIVORS FROM THE WATER. SLOW AHEAD TOGETHER. UPHOLDER SLIPS BACK INSIDE THE DESTROYERS' SCREEN. AS HE MOVES TO PERISCOPE, READY TO MAKE THIS ATTACK, SUDDENLY HE SEES IN FRONT OF HIM A DESTROYER MOVING FAST TOWARDS HIM. DOWN PERISCOPE! KEEP 45 FEET! HE HAS TO DIVE IMMEDIATELY TO AVOID A COLLISION. THE DESTROYER PASSES OVERHEAD. THE CREW BRACES FOR A DEPTH CHARGE ATTACK. BUT THEY ARE LUCKY. THE DESTROYER DOES NOT KNOW THEY ARE THERE. UP PERISCOPE. BUT THEY'RE NOT SAFE YET. IN THE CONFUSION, WANKLYN NOW FINDS HIMSELF ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH HIS TARGET: THE TROOPSHIP OCEANIA. DOWN PERISCOPE. SEPTEMBER 18, 1941. IN CLOSE QUARTERS WITH ENEMY SHIPS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN... DOWN PERISCOPE! KEEP 45 FEET! BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS UPHOLDER TRIES TO MANEUVER INTO POSITION FOR AN ATTACK. BUT BY THAT POINT, HE'S MOVED FAR TOO CLOSE TO THE OCEANIA FOR THE ATTACK TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND THERE'S DANGER OF EVEN COLLIDING WITH THE VESSEL. SO HE IMMEDIATELY ORDERS ANOTHER DIVE TO GO UNDER THE SHIP. DOWN PERISCOPE, KEEP 250 FEET! WANKLYN MUST DIVE DEEP ENOUGH TO SLIP UNDER OCEANIA TO AVOID BEING RAMMED. A COLLISION WITH A TROOPSHIP WOULD SINK UPHOLDER. IT WORKS. UPHOLDER SLIDES BENEATH THE TROOPSHIP. 2,000 YARDS PAST, WANKLYN SWINGS THE SUBMARINE AROUND. THEN HE PREPARES TO FINISH OFF OCEANIA. WANKLYN ORDERS UPHOLDER TO PERISCOPE DEPTH. THEY ARE IN A PERFECT POSITION FOR A FINAL ATTACK ON THE DAMAGED TROOPSHIP. STAND BY TUBES ONE AND TWO! BUT UPHOLDER'S SUBSONIC TRANSMITTER REMAINS DAMAGED. WITHOUT IT, THEY ARE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE OTHER SUBMARINES NEARBY. WANKLYN HAS NO IDEA WHERE THE OTHER BRITISH SUBS ARE. WHAT HE DIDN'T REALIZED IS THAT UNBEATEN, WHICH HAD BEEN THE VESSEL THAT HAD ORIGINALLY SIGNALED THE CONVOY, HAD BEEN FOLLOWING IN THE CONVOY'S WAKE ALL NIGHT AND ITSELF WAS TAKING UP POSITION. LIEUTENANT COMMANDER EDWARD WOODWARD ABOARD HMS UNBEATEN READIES FOR HIS OWN ATTACK ON OCEANIA. STAND BY TUBES ONE AND TWO! ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF ALLOWING SUBMARINERS TO DO THEIR OWN THING, EVEN IN GROUP TACTICS, IS THAT YOU'RE LIABLE TO HAVE WHAT THEY CALL A BLUE ON BLUE. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY MIGHT ATTACK EACH OTHER. WOODWARD ALSO DOES NOT KNOW THAT UPHOLDER IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TROOPSHIP. IF EITHER SUBMARINE MISSES THE TARGET, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THEY WILL HIT THE OTHER. AT SUCH CLOSE RANGE IT WOULD SINK, KILLING EVERYONE ON BOARD. FIRE ONE. FIRE TWO. THE TORPEDOES RUSH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ENEMY SHIP AND HMS UNBEATEN. ON THE OTHER SIDE, WOODWARD ALSO READIES HIS SHOT. CHECK FIRING BEARING. BUT HE IS NOT FAST ENOUGH. BOTH OF WANKLYN'S TORPEDOES CRASH INTO THE SIDE OF THE 20,000-TON TROOPSHIP OCEANIA. IT MUST BE THE ULTIMATE FRUSTRATION FOR A SUBMARINE COMMANDER TO LINE UP YOUR TARGET AND ABOUT TO FIRE, AND SUDDENLY YOUR TARGET IS TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU BY YOUR COLLEAGUE. LUCK PLAYS A BIG PART IN SUBMARINE WARFARE. WANKLYN WAS NOT VERY LUCKY TO START WITH, BUT SUDDENLY THE GODS BEGAN TO SMILE ON HIM, AND THEY WERE VERY LUCKY INDEED. IT ONLY TAKES EIGHT MINUTES FOR OCEANIA TO SINK. DOWN PERISCOPE. WANKLYN'S PERFORMANCE ON THIS OCCASION WAS NOTHING SHORT OF EXCEPTIONAL. THE ABILITY AT THAT DISTANCE, USING THE EYE FOR THE MOST PART, USING THE BOAT AS A MEANS OF CREATING THE SALVO IN THAT WAY, WAS A STUNNING PIECE OF SUBMARINE WORK. HMS UPHOLDER ENTERS MALTA HARBOR ON SEPTEMBER 20, 1941. PRIOR TO GOING OUT ON THE SEPTEMBER PATROL, THE CREW HAD BEEN CALLED BACK FROM REST, AND WANKLYN HAD MADE IT CLEAR IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY WENT TO SEA AND THEY CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK. WHEN THEY CAME BACK, THEY DID GET A REST, BUT IT WAS A SHORT REST. AND BACK THEY WERE AT SEA TO PATROL OFF SICILY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS. AFTER 25 PATROLS, HMS UPHOLDER IS CONSIDERED A TONNAGE LEADER OF THE ROYAL NAVY. THEIR TALLY INCLUDES 119,000 TONS OF ENEMY SHIPPING, INCLUDING THREE U-BOATS AND THE LINER SHIPS CONVEYING TROOPS AND SUPPLIES TO THE BATTLEFRONT IN NORTH AFRICA. WANKLYN IS REGARDED AS PERHAPS THE FINEST SUBMARINE COMMANDER IN THE LONG HISTORY OF THE ROYAL NAVY SUBMARINE SERVICE. WHEN THE ROYAL NAVY WENT BACK TO OPERATING CONVENTIONALLY POWERED SUBMARINES FOR A WHILE, THE FIRST OF THE CLASS WAS CALLED UPHOLDER. ON NOVEMBER 18th, THE BRITISH LAUNCH OPERATION CRUSADER. HUGELY SUCCESSFUL, THEY THROW BACK THE AXIS FORCES. ROMMEL AND HIS MEN RETREAT 500 MILES IN ONLY SIX WEEKS, DENIED THE SUPPLIES THEY NEED TO FIGHT. YOU CAN ATTRIBUTE THE PROBLEMS ROMMEL IS IN IN AUTUMN 1941 TO THE SINGLE FACT THAT MALTA IS STILL IN BRITISH HANDS. THE BRITISH PUSH BACK THE ITALIAN AND GERMAN FORCES BACK OVER THE CYRENAICA, AND ROMMEL FINDS HIMSELF WHERE HE HAD STARTED THE WAR A COUPLE OF MONTHS EARLIER. THE 240-DAY SIEGE OF TOBRUK IS LIFTED, AND THE EXHAUSTED DEFENDERS ARE ABLE TO MARCH OUT IN TRIUMPH. UPHOLDER'S STORY WOULD END DIFFERENTLY. WANKLYN AND UPHOLDER DISAPPEAR ON APRIL 14, 1942. WE STILL DON'T PRECISELY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. AND IT'S RATHER TYPICAL OF THE SUBMARINE SERVICE, ACTUALLY, AND THE COVERTNESS OF THE OPERATION AND THE STEALTH OF THE OPERATION THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED CERTAINLY TO ONE OF THE GREATEST SUBMARINE OFFICERS IN HISTORY. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE BRITISH SUBMARINE FORCE REMAIN OVERLOOKED. THE SUBMARINE SERVICE IN THE ROYAL NAVY HAS NEVER REALLY RECEIVED AS MUCH PUBLICITY AS THE ANTI-SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN, SAY, IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC OR THE U. S. SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN IN THE PACIFIC. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUBMARINE WARFARE IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, WE OFTEN CONNECT IT TO THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC, WITH THE GERMANS BEING THE SUBMARINE HUNTERS AND THE ALLIES BEING THE HUNTED. IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, IT WAS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. THE ALLIES WERE THE HUNTERS AND THE GERMANS AND THE ITALIANS WERE THE HUNTED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LOSSES THE AXIS SUSTAINED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, ALMOST HALF OF THEM ARE ATTRIBUTED TO SUBMARINE WARFARE, THE REST TO SHIPS AND TO AIRCRAFT. BUT THE SUBMARINES ARE THE GREATEST DANGER FOR AXIS CONVOYS OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN, FROM ITALY TO NORTH AFRICA. IT IS A CRITICAL WIN FOR THE ALLIES. THE LOSS OF NORTH AFRICA BEFORE THE END OF 1941 COULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS FOR BRITAIN, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE MANPOWER AND RAW MATERIALS. SECURING THE SUEZ CANAL, SHIPMENTS FROM THE COLONY OF INDIA AND CRITICAL OIL SUPPLIES FROM THE MIDDLE EAST ENSURED BRITAIN WOULD SURVIVE AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT.
