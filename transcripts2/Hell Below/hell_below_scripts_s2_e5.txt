 EARLY 1945. IN THE WATERS OFF NORWAY, A BRITISH SUBMARINE TRACKS A GERMAN U-BOAT. WITH NEITHER VESSEL ON THE SURFACE, A RARE SITUATION DEVELOPS. UP PERISCOPE. NO SUBMARINE HAS SUCCESSFULLY ATTACKED ANOTHER WHILE BOTH WERE SUBMERGED. THE BRITISH CAPTAIN FACES A UNIQUE CHALLENGE. THIS IS A NEW PROBLEM. HIS MECHANICAL INSTRUMENTS CAN'T HELP HIM THAT MUCH, IF AT ALL.

 HE HAS TO DO IT ALL IN HIS HEAD. FIRE. THEY WILL NEED A NEW BATTLE PLAN... HARD STARBOARD! TO CREATE A DIFFERENT KIND OF SUBMARINE WARFARE. IN WORLD WAR II, A SUBSEA WEAPON ALLOWS WARRIORS TO FIGHT FROM BENEATH THE WAVES. WITH CUNNING, FORCE, AND TENACITY, THEIR ENEMIES STRIKE BACK. REVOLUTIONARY BUT STILL SOMETIMES PRIMITIVE, IT'S A DESPERATE BID... TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WAR. THEIR STORIES ARE LEGEND. NOVEMBER 11, 1944.

 BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS VENTURER HAS WEATHERED THE ROUGH NORWEGIAN SEA ON ITS EIGHTH WAR PATROL. THEIR TOP SECRET MISSION IS TO DELIVER SUPPLIES TO RESISTANCE FIGHTERS IN OCCUPIED NORWAY. THE GERMANS, DURING THIS PERIOD, POURED IN SOME 400,000 SOLDIERS IN THIS TINY COUNTRY. ON THE NAVAL SIDE, A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE GERMAN KRIEGSMARINE WAS SITUATED IN NORWEGIAN WATERS FOR THE WHOLE PERIOD. IN DEFIANCE, SOME NORWEGIANS WORK WITH THE ALLIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR NAZI OCCUPIERS. IN EXCHANGE, THE BRITISH PROVIDE SUPPORT, SUPPLIES, AND MONEY, OFTEN DELIVERED BY SUBMARINE. THIS TIME, THE RENDEZVOUS POINT IS NEAR NARVIK, IN NORTHERN NORWAY. AS HMS VENTURER TRAVELS NORTH, A CREW MEMBER SPOTS A SHAPE THROUGH THE SEARCH PERISCOPE. THROUGH THE DARK AND ROUGH SEAS, HE MAKES OUT THE CONNING TOWER OF ANOTHER SUBMARINE. HE DOESN'T KNOW IT, BUT HE HAS FOUND GERMAN U-BOAT U-771. GET THE CAPTAIN. THE U-BOAT TRAVELS QUICKLY ON THE SURFACE. U- 771 SPENT WEEKS BATTLING AGAINST TWO HEAVILY DEFENDED ALLIED CONVOYS HEADING TO THE SOVIET UNION. THE CREW WERE LUCKY TO ESCAPE ALIVE. THE BRITISH SUB REMAINS UNDETECTED AND ONLY A FEW THOUSAND YARDS AWAY. IT CONTINUES TO TRAVEL BENEATH THE SURFACE. THE SUBMARINE'S CAPTAIN IS LIEUTENANT JAMES LAUNDERS. ONLY 25 YEARS OLD, LAUNDERS JOINED THE ROYAL NAVY AS A CADET IN 1938, BEFORE BRITAIN DECLARED WAR. HE'S COMMANDED HMS VENTURER FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. LAUNDERS MUST ACT QUICKLY BEFORE THE U-BOAT SPOTS HIM. IF HE SPOTS YOUR PERISCOPE, NOBODY CAN TAKE COUNTERACTION BETTER THAN ANOTHER SUBMARINE COMMANDER. SO THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS VERY HOT INDEED. LAUNDERS SNEAKS A LOOK THROUGH THE PERISCOPE, THEN ASKS FOR THE TARGET'S SPEED, RANGE, AND BEARING. SPEED AND RANGE. ESTIMATED SPEED, 13 KNOTS. THEY ESTIMATE THE U-BOAT IS MAKING 13 KNOTS. FULL AHEAD TOGETHER. DOWN PERISCOPE. HE ORDERS VENTURER TO CLOSE IN ON THE U-BOAT, WHILE HE WORKS OUT HIS CALCULATIONS AND THE TORPEDOES ARE READIED. HE WON'T GET ANOTHER CHANCE. HE MUST GET IT RIGHT. HE WORKS OUT IN HIS MIND WHAT THE BEST CHANCE OF HITTING THE TARGET IS. THIS WILL MEAN FIRING ALL FOUR IN HIS TUBES. HE WILL STILL HAVE FOUR MORE TORPEDOES LEFT, BUT NOT ENOUGH TIME TO RELOAD THEM BEFORE THE U-BOAT COULD COUNTER-ATTACK. SO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE HE GETS THE TARGET. VENTURER CLOSES IN. LAUNDERS TAKES A FINAL LOOK. SPEED AND RANGE. THE U-BOAT IS IN VENTURER'S CROSSHAIRS. 2,000 YARDS. THE TORPEDO CREW IS READY AND WAITS FOR LAUNDERS' COMMAND. LAUNDERS ORDERS THE SPREAD OF FOUR TORPEDOES. FIRE. THE MARK VIII TORPEDOES SPEED TOWARD THE GERMAN U-BOAT AT OVER 50 MILES PER HOUR. EACH CONTAINS 805 POUNDS OF THE EXPLOSIVE TORPEX. VENTURER'S CREW HEARS THE EXPLOSION THROUGH THE HULL. THE HYDROPHONE OPERATOR LOSES THE SOUND OF THE U-BOAT'S PROPELLER. THERE IS NOTHING MORE FROM U-771'S POSITION. SUBMARINERS ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE PEOPLE. THEY HAVE TO BE. THEY WILL PUT ALL THEIR EFFORTS INTO SINKING THE ENEMY SUBMARINE AND TEND NOT TO THINK PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE SUBMARINE OVER THERE COULD HAPPEN TO THEM, TOO. VENTURER BECOMES ONE OF THE FEW BRITISH SUBS TO SINK ANOTHER SUBMARINE. LAUNDERS IS LATER AWARDED THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE ORDER FOR SINKING U-771. REMARKABLY, THE WHOLE ATTACK TAKES PLACE IN JUST SIX MINUTES. HIS GREAT VIRTUE AS A SUBMARINE COMMANDER IS HIS ABILITY TO SUM THINGS UP VERY, VERY QUICKLY IN HIS OWN MIND AND CARRY OUT AN ATTACK RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY. AND HE'S VERY GOOD AT THAT. AFTER THE SURPRISE ATTACK, VENTURER RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL MISSION, PUTTING SUPPLIES ASHORE IN NORWAY. THE SINKING OF U-771 IS PART OF GROWING PRESSURE BY THE ALLIES SINCE D-DAY. AMERICANS, BRITISH, AND CANADIANS LEAD ADVANCES ACROSS WESTERN EUROPE. THE RED ARMY DRIVES ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE AND PREPARES TO TAKE EAST PRUSSIA. TO STEM THE TIDE, HITLER TURNS TO GROSSADMIRAL KARL DÖNITZ AND HIS U-BOATS. NAZI GERMANY WANTS TO SHARE EXPERIMENTAL MILITARY TECHNOLOGY WITH JAPAN, THE REMAINING AXIS POWER. THEY HAVE WEAPONS CALLED WUNDERWAFFEN. WUNDERWAFFEN, IT MEANS WONDER WEAPON, MIRACLE WEAPON. THE LONGER THE WAR GOES, IT BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THE GERMAN PROPAGANDA, FOR GOEBBELS. WUNDERWAFFEN WEAPONS, LIKE THE V-1 BOMBS AND V-2 ROCKETS, WERE UNLEASHED AGAINST THE BRITISH, PARTICULARLY AFTER D-DAY... CAUSING MORE THAN 30,000 CASUALTIES. THE GERMANS ARE VERY INNOVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, BUT THE PROBLEM FOR THEM IS THEY CAN'T PRODUCE THESE THINGS EN MASSE, IN CONTRAST TO THE ALLIES. AND THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. THESE ARE TWO COUNTRIES, RELATIVELY SMALL. AND THEY ARE DIVIDED BY THE ALLIED SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OR SPHERE OF POWER, BE IT BY THE BRITISH, BE IT BY THE AMERICANS, BE IT BY THE SOVIETS. SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO EXCHANGE IDEAS, TO EXCHANGE PLANS, AND ALSO TO EXCHANGE TECHNOLOGY. WHEN SURFACE SHIPS CARRYING WAR MATERIALS TO JAPAN ARE REPEATEDLY SUNK, THE ONLY REMAINING OPTION IS TO USE SUBMARINES. GERMAN U-BOAT U-864 WILL TRANSPORT WUNDERWAFFEN TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING PARTS AND PLANS FOR THE MESSERSCHMITT ME 163 KOMET, AN EXPERIMENTAL ROCKET-POWERED INTERCEPTOR AIRCRAFT, AND THE MESSERSCHMITT ME 262 SWALLOW, THE FIRST JET FIGHTER TO SEE AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT. IN A MISSION CODE-NAMED OPERATION CAESAR, THE TRANSPORT ALSO INCLUDES LEADING-EDGE SCIENTISTS AND TWO JAPANESE EXPERTS RETURNING TO JAPAN BY SUBMARINE. THEIR FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE WILL BE VITAL FOR MASS PRODUCTION OF WUNDERWAFFEN. THEY HOPE THE COMBINATION OF JAPANESE MANPOWER WITH GERMAN SCIENCE WILL TILT THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC IN JAPAN'S FAVOR AND FORCE THE ALLIES TO DIVERT MORE TROOPS TO THE FAR EAST, PULLING THEM OUT OF EUROPE TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR A NAZI RESURGENCE. U- 864 IS A BRAND-NEW U-BOAT. U- BOAT COMMANDER RALF-REIMAR WOLFRAM STARTS DRILLS AND SEA TRIALS IN OCTOBER. WITH ONLY THREE PREVIOUS PATROLS, WOLFRAM IS CONSIDERED A SEASONED OFFICER. AFTER 1943, MANY OF THE EXPERIENCED OFFICERS WERE KILLED DURING THE WAR, AND MANY OF THE YOUNGER U-BOAT COMMANDERS DIDN'T LIVE ENOUGH, LONG ENOUGH, TO GAIN THE NECESSARY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE MANY OF THE U-BOATS WERE SUNK ON THEIR FIRST PATROLS. SO WOLFRAM, AS AN EXPERIENCED OFFICER, WAS QUITE UNIQUE BECAUSE HE WAS ONE OF THE OLD GUYS, HE WAS ONE OF THE EXPERIENCED GUYS. THEY LEAVE KIEL, GERMANY, IN DECEMBER. THE BOAT AND ALSO THE CREW AS A TEAM WERE UNEXPERIENCED, SO IT WAS THE FIRST PATROL AND ALSO THE FIRST REAL CHALLENGE. THE U-BOAT LIKELY CARRIES A FULL COMPLEMENT OF 27 TORPEDOES AND OTHER WEAPONS TO DEFEND ITSELF. THEIR SIX-MONTH JOURNEY WILL TAKE THEM NORTH OF THE BRITISH ISLES, AROUND THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE AFRICAN CONTINENT, ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN, AND TO A U-BOAT BASE IN MALAYSIA. THEY STOP IN OCCUPIED NORWAY TO REFUEL AND PICK UP ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES. ALLIED SUBMARINE AND AIRCRAFT PATROL THE WATERS BETWEEN THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THEY WILL HAVE TO SNEAK ACROSS BEFORE MAKING A BREAK FOR THE ATLANTIC. U- 864 HAS SOME OF THE LATEST IN U-BOAT TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING A NEW DEVICE CALLED THE SNORKEL. IN WORLD WAR II, ALL SUBMARINES HAD TO SURFACE TO RECHARGE THEIR BATTERIES, WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO DIVE AND STAY UNDERWATER. BUT TRAVELING ON THE SURFACE IS DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE DAY. WHEN THE SNORKEL IS RAISED, ONLY A SMALL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT STICKS UP OUT OF THE WATER, ALLOWING MOST OF THE U-BOAT TO REMAIN HIDDEN. SO A U-BOAT COULD DIVE, USE THE DIESEL ENGINE TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY BY GETTING IN THE NECESSARY AIR THROUGH THE SNORKEL AND ALSO THE AIR FOR THE CREW TO BREATHE. BUT U-864 DOES NOT GET VERY FAR. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SNORKEL. WHEN WOLFRAM REPORTS THE PROBLEM, U- BOAT COMMAND DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. THEY ORDER U-864 TO A NEARBY PORT FOR INSPECTION. JUST AS THE U-BOAT TURNS, IT COMES TO AN ABRUPT HALT. THE SUBMARINE RUNS AGROUND IN THE SHALLOW WATERS. WOLFRAM'S PROBLEMS HAVE GONE FROM BAD TO WORSE. THE JAGGED STONE OF THE NORWEGIAN FJORDS COULD EASILY DAMAGE HIS HULL. THE OUTCOME OF OPERATION CAESAR AND HIS U-BOAT HANG IN THE BALANCE. DECEMBER 1944. NAZI U-BOAT U-864 HAS ENCOUNTERED TROUBLE OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY. EN ROUTE TO JAPAN WITH PLANS AND PARTS FOR SECRET WEAPONS, THE U-BOAT HAS RUN AGROUND. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE IN A NORWEGIAN FJORD BECAUSE IT'S VERY NARROW, THERE ARE SHALLOWS, THERE ARE PROBABLY UNCHARTED ROCKS AND REEFS. UNTIL THIS VERY DAY, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO, UM, TO NAVIGATE. WOLFRAM IMMEDIATELY SENDS THE CREW TO CONDUCT A CHECK OF THE SUBMARINE'S CONDITION. THEY CONFIRM THAT THE INTERIOR OF THE HULL HAS NOT BEEN DAMAGED. U- BOAT COMMANDER WOLFRAM IS LUCKY. U- 864 CARRIES A DANGEROUS CARGO HIDDEN IN ITS KEEL- 67 TONS OF MERCURY. MERCURY IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN WEAPONS PRODUCTION, OFTEN USED AS A DETONATOR TO SET OFF EXPLOSIVES. VERY DENSE, EACH OF THE 1,857 FLASKS ON BOARD HOLDS ABOUT 2.5 QUARTS OF LIQUID MERCURY AND WEIGHS AROUND 70 POUNDS. THE FLASKS REPLACE MUCH OF THE LEAD BALLAST SUBMARINES USUALLY CARRY IN THEIR KEEL. FORTUNATELY FOR THE CREW, THEIR LETHAL CARGO REMAINS INTACT. WOLFRAM CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER MISTAKE. HE REQUESTS A HARBOR PILOT- A LOCAL SHIP'S CAPTAIN- TO GUIDE THEM INTO PORT. FOR A SUBMARINE ON A SECRET MISSION, THEY'RE STARTING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE HAS ALREADY GLEANED INFORMATION FROM DECODED GERMAN INTERCEPTS AND LEARNED THAT GERMANY IS SENDING WUNDERWAFFEN TO JAPAN. THEY KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT CAN BE DONE IS BY SUBMARINE. THE QUESTION IS, WHICH SUBMARINE? BREAKING CODES DOES NOT ALWAYS PROVIDE TIMELY INFORMATION ABOUT GERMANY'S INDIVIDUAL NAVAL UNITS. THE OCEAN IS VAST. EVEN WITH GOOD INTELLIGENCE, FINDING SOMETHING OUT THERE IS REALLY VERY DIFFICULT. SHIPS AND SUBMARINES CAN GO WHERE THE CAPTAIN LIKES, AND SOMETIMES THE CAPTAINS MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR MISSION SAFELY. AFTER GERMAN KRIEGSMARINE CREWS CONFIRM THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE U-864'S HULL... THE U-BOAT THEN HEADS TO BERGEN, ALSO IN NORWAY, TO REPAIR THE SNORKEL. EACH OF THEIR STOPS INCREASES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CONTACT WITH THE U-BOAT. THIS KIND OF INFORMATION HAS PROVED CRITICAL TO THE ALLIES. IT IS SECRETLY SHARED BY A STRONG RESISTANCE MOVEMENT THAT HAS OPERATED IN NORWAY SINCE EARLY IN THE WAR. WHEN WAR BROKE OUT IN APRIL 1940 IN NORWAY- THE NAZI INVASION- THERE WERE TWO MONTHS OF FIGHTING. BY JUNE, RATHER THAN SURRENDER, THE KING OF NORWAY AND KEY MINISTERS FLEE TO ENGLAND AND SET UP A GOVERNMENT IN EXILE. THAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE COOPERATION WITH THE BRITISH ON BRITISH SOIL. THEY BRING WHAT'S LEFT OF THEIR NAVY AND FIGHTING FORCES AND PROVIDE A LINK TO THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT LEFT IN NORWAY, WHO SPY AND PASS ON THE INFORMATION. MORE TYPICAL INFORMATION WOULD BE THAT THIS- AND-THAT SUBMARINE WITH PENNANT SO- AND-SO WERE SPOTTED IN SOME PORT OR IN THE U-BOAT PENS. BUT THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO REPORT ON ANY NAVAL MOVEMENTS, BEING UPDATED ON WHERE THE VESSELS WERE ACTUALLY SITUATED AT THE VERY MOMENT. THAT WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE, OF COURSE. IN RETURN, BRITISH INTELLIGENCE PROVIDES FUNDING, TRAINING, AND EQUIPMENT. WHEN U-864 RAN AGROUND, TWO JAPANESE MEN IN NORWAY WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN NOTICED AND REPORTED. THE CANDID REPORTS ON MOVEMENTS- IN THIS CASE, SUBMARINES AND SO ON- COULD BE TRANSMITTED FAIRLY RAPIDLY. A TIP-OFF THAT U-864 IS IN BERGEN COULD BE A GAME-CHANGER. IT'S EARLY 1945. THE ALLIED ARMIES HAVE RETAKEN FRANCE. BERGEN IS WHERE THE U-BOATS ARE GOING TO BE CONCENTRATED. INFORMATION FROM THE NORWEGIAN RESISTANCE MAY PROVIDE THE ALLIES AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP TECHNICAL EXPERTS WITH WEAPON PLANS AND PARTS FROM BEING SHIPPED TO JAPAN. AND THE RAF STRATEGIC BOMBING COMMAND IS GOING TO GO AFTER THE U-BOAT PEN AT BERGEN. ON JANUARY 12th, 32 AVRO LANCASTER BOMBERS MAKE THEIR WAY TO NORWAY. THE LANCASTERS CARRY TALLBOY BOMBS- 21 FEET LONG, CONTAINING 5,200 POUNDS OF THE EXPLOSIVE TORPEX. TALLBOYS DETONATE AFTER BURYING THEMSELVES INSIDE ARMOR, TUNNELS, AND EVEN CONCRETE. THEY ARE PERFECT FOR ATTACKING STRUCTURES LIKE HEAVILY REINFORCED U-BOAT PENS. IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEATED FIGHT WITH GERMAN LUFTWAFFE, A LANCASTER DROPS A TALLBOY NEAR THEIR TARGET. IT TAKES DAYS TO FIND OUT IF THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL. REPORTS COME IN FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. ALLIED INTELLIGENCE MUST PIECE THEM TOGETHER. THE BRITISH WOULD HAVE LEARNED THAT THE ATTACK WAS A SUCCESS THROUGH INTELLIGENCE, THE INTERCEPTION OF GERMAN MESSAGES, BUT ALSO HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, AGENTS FROM THE NORWEGIAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENT. THE NEWS IS BAD. THE ALLIES LEARNED THAT THEY HAD A DIRECT HIT ON THE U-BOAT PENS, BUT IT DID VERY LITTLE DAMAGE. BUT IT IS ENOUGH TO DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF U-864 A LITTLE LONGER. ONE CAN'T HELP FEELING A LITTLE SORRY FOR THE JAPANESE PEOPLE ON BOARD THE U-BOAT BECAUSE THEY ARE LEAVING ONE DEFEATED POWER AND GOING BACK HOME TO A POWER THAT'S ABOUT PERHAPS TO BE DEFEATED ITSELF. BUT PERHAPS IF IT GETS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S IN THE SUBMARINE, THEN JAPAN MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT. DESPITE THE SETBACK, THE ALLIES STILL BELIEVE THEY KNOW ENOUGH TO STOP THE TRANSPORT OF GERMAN TECHNOLOGY TO THE PACIFIC FRONT. WITH THE WAR NEARING THE END, YOU NEEDED TO STOP THE TRADE AND TECHNOLOGY BETWEEN GERMANY AND JAPAN, BECAUSE YOU JUST COULDN'T TAKE THE CHANCE OF THEM USING NEW WEAPONS TO EXTEND THE WAR. RATHER THAN TARGET THE REINFORCED U-BOAT PENS AGAIN, THEY WILL TRY WHEN U-864 IS MORE EXPOSED... AND USE A SUBMARINE TO ATTACK THE U-BOAT. BRITAIN'S 9th SUBMARINE FLOTILLA IS BASED AT HMS AMBROSE, IN SCOTLAND. SUBMARINES FROM THE 9th FLOTILLA HAVE HARASSED GERMAN SHIPS IN THE NORTH SEA SINCE 1940. ON FEBRUARY 2, 1945, HMS VENTURER LEAVES LERWICK, IN THE SHETLAND ISLANDS, ON ITS 11th WAR PATROL. VENTURER IS A BRITISH V, OR VAMPIRE CLASS, SUBMARINE. ONE OF THE EARLY ONES WAS CALLED VAMPIRE, AND IT SEEMED QUITE USEFUL, A GOOD NAME FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DRAWING THE ENEMY'S BLOOD. THE V CLASS ARE NOT THE FASTEST SUBMARINES, MAKING ONLY 11 KNOTS ON THE SURFACE. HOWEVER, JUST 204 FEET IN LENGTH, THEIR COMPACT SIZE MAKES THEM IDEAL FOR REGULAR PATROLS IN NORWEGIAN FJORDS. VENTURER STILL SAILS UNDER THE COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT JAMES LAUNDERS. JIMMY LAUNDERS HAS A VERY HIGH REPUTATION IN THE SUBMARINE SERVICE. HE'S VERY INTELLIGENT, HE'S VERY EFFECTIVE, AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, HE HAS THE COMPLETE TRUST OF HIS SHIP'S COMPANY. THEIR PLANNED OPERATING AREA IS AT THE SOUTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE CITY OF BERGEN. PATROLLING HERE MEANS THAT LAUNDERS CAN INTERCEPT GERMAN VESSELS AS THEY COME BACK TO BASE. TIRED U-BOAT CREWS RETURNING FROM LONG PATROLS MAY LET DOWN THEIR GUARD WITH THE LURE OF CLEAN CLOTHES, FRESH FOOD, AND COMFORTABLE BEDS THEY WILL FIND IN PORT. LAUNDERS IS SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT WHEN SUBMARINES ARE COMING BACK OFF OF PATROL, THEY'RE MOST VULNERABLE. THEREFORE THEY BECOME EASIER TARGETS. BUT WHEN VENTURER REACHES THE PATROL AREA, THEY RECEIVE A CODED MESSAGE FROM HEADQUARTERS. THE ORDERS REDIRECT LAUNDERS TO PATROL OFF THE COAST OF FEDJE INSTEAD. THIS MEANS THAT VENTURER WILL TRY TO INTERCEPT U-BOATS WITH FAR MORE ALERT CREWS EXITING BERGEN INTO THE NORTH SEA AND BEYOND. WHEN LAUNDERS RECEIVES THE ORDER TO DIVERT TO FEDJE, THAT PUTS HIM RIGHT IN THE PATH OF U-864. FEBRUARY 8, 1945. GERMAN U-BOAT U-864 LEAVES THE U-BOAT PENS AT BERGEN, NORWAY, FOLLOWING A SERIES OF REPAIRS. IT HEADS NORTHWEST TO A DEEP-WATER CHANNEL THAT LEADS TO THE OCEAN. FROM THERE IT WILL CONTINUE ITS MISSION TO BRING TOP-SECRET GERMAN TECHNOLOGY TO JAPAN. U- BOAT COMMANDER RALF-REIMAR WOLFRAM IS UNAWARE THAT BRITISH SUBMARINE VENTURER HAS BEEN ORDERED TO PATROL THE AREA. BUT THE ROYAL NAVY'S LIEUTENANT JAMES LAUNDERS DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR, EITHER. HIS ORDERS MAKE NO MENTION OF U-864. THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE PICTURE SEEMS TO HAVE INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A SUBMARINE DOING SOMETHING. SUBMARINERS ARE MEANT TO SHOW CONSIDERABLE INITIATIVE. YOU PUT THEM IN THE RIGHT AREA, AND THEY ARE EXPECTED TO FIND TARGETS. AFTER THE U-BOAT'S ESCORT RETURNS TO PORT, WOLFRAM RUNS READINESS DRILLS WITH HIS CREW. THEIR JOURNEY HAS JUST BEGUN, BUT THEY MUST BE ON THEIR GUARD. HE KNOWS THAT THE AREA IS REGULARLY INFILTRATED BY RAF PLANES AND BRITISH NAVAL SHIPS. SATISFIED EVERYONE IS READY, HE ORDERS U-864 TO SUBMERGE. HE SETS COURSE TOWARD THE SHETLAND ISLANDS- 100 MILES NORTH OF THE SCOTTISH MAINLAND. BUT BEFORE LONG, HE HAS ANOTHER PROBLEM. ONE OF U-864'S DIESEL ENGINES IS MISFIRING. FOR WOLFRAM, IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ALMOST INCREDIBLE STREAK OF BAD LUCK. HE HAD FINALLY PUT TO SEA AGAIN, HE AGAIN RUNS INTO TECHNICAL TROUBLE WITH ONE OF THE ENGINES MAKING STRANGE NOISES. IT WAS PROBABLY A BROKEN PISTON, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE BANGING IS SO LOUD THAT IT COULD BE PICKED UP BY ENEMY VESSELS FOR MILES AROUND. FOR A U-BOAT TRYING TO SNEAKING THROUGH ENEMY-INFESTED WATERS, SILENCE WAS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE U-BOAT CREW TO LISTEN FOR SOUNDS OF OTHER SHIPS NEARBY. WOLFRAM SURFACES TO CONTACT U-BOAT HEADQUARTERS. BUT HE CAN GUESS WHAT'S COMING. THEY ORDER U-864 BACK TO BERGEN. HOWEVER, WITH ALLIED AIR AND SEA VESSELS PATROLLING THE AREA, THEY DON'T WANT HIM TO RETURN ALONE. THEY WILL SEND AN ESCORT TO MEET HIM. A DISAPPOINTED WOLFRAM ORDERS THEM TO PERISCOPE DEPTH TO WAIT. FOR THE U-BOAT, THE ENGINE MALFUNCTION IS A MAJOR PROBLEM, BUT FOR BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS VENTURER, IT ALSO CHANGES THE GAME. IF AN ESCORT ARRIVES, THE RISKS TO LAUNDERS GREATLY INCREASE. THE CHANCE OF HIS PERISCOPE BEING SPOTTED GREATLY INCREASE. HE MIGHT WELL LOSE THE TARGET AND LOSE HIS OPPORTUNITY. HE MIGHT EVEN BE ATTACKED HIMSELF. HE MIGHT EVEN BE SUNK. IF VENTURER MISSES THIS CHANCE, THE ALLIES WILL HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. THEY MAY NOT GET A TIPOFF ABOUT THE U-BOAT'S DEPARTURE NEXT TIME. THEY CONTINUE WITH A THOROUGH SEARCH PATTERN. FINALLY, ON THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY 9th, VENTURER'S HYDROPHONE OPERATOR DETECTS A FAINT SOUND. THE SOUND PICKED UP COULD WELL BE A FISHING BOAT. IT'S A NOISY DIESEL. AND THEREFORE YOU SEE IS IT A FISHING BOAT? IT COULD ACTUALLY BE A GERMAN ARMED TRAWLER, FOR EXAMPLE. SO YOU TRY TO FIND IT. OFFICER OF THE WATCH LIEUTENANT CHALMERS BEGINS A METHODICAL SEARCH FOR THE SOURCE. HE'S CAREFUL TO HAVE THE PERISCOPE UP FOR ONLY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. WHEN YOUR PERISCOPE'S UP, YOU ARE GIVING YOUR POSITION AWAY. YOU HAVE IT UP FOR THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF TIME. YOU RAISE IT THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF DISTANCE ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SEA. DOWN PERISCOPE. IT IS YOUR GREATEST HELP, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE YOUR GREATEST ENEMY. MORE THAN AN HOUR LATER, CHALMERS SPOTS SOMETHING TO THE NORTH. GET THE CAPTAIN. LOOKING THROUGH THE TINY LENS, HE MANAGES TO MAKE OUT A THIN MAST, NEARLY THREE MILES AWAY, AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF MOVING OCEAN. CHALMERS UPDATES LAUNDERS, WHO ORDERS THE CREW TO ACTION STATIONS. ACTION STATIONS, ACTION STATIONS. ALL COMPARTMENTS REPORT. LIKE THEIR CONTACT WITH U-771, VENTURER HAS SPOTTED THE ENEMY U-BOAT FIRST. BUT THIS ENCOUNTER WILL BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. THE EARLIER ATTACK THAT LAUNDERS HAS CARRIED OUT IS A CLASSIC SUBMERGED SUBMARINE VERSUS SURFACE SUBMARINE ATTACK. THEY GO BACK TO THE FIRST WORLD WAR. THIS IS SOMETHING NEW. VENTURER AND U-864 ARE BOTH SUBMERGED AND VIRTUALLY BLIND TO EACH OTHER. BECAUSE LAUNDERS CANNOT SEE THE SUBMARINE- HE CAN ONLY SEE ITS PERISCOPE- HE ONLY HAS INDICATIONS, REALLY, OF WHERE IT IS. THE PERISCOPE IS THEIR ONLY POINT OF VISUAL REFERENCE. IT IS A TINY TARGET. AT FIRST THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THE SUBMARINE IS ORIENTED AROUND IT. NORMALLY, IN AN ATTACK ON A SURFACE SUBMARINE, IT'S MUCH EASIER. THIS IS MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED. THIS IS LATE 20th CENTURY NAVAL WARFARE. UP PERISCOPE. IN THE CONTROL ROOM, LAUNDERS LOOKS THROUGH THE PERISCOPE AND REQUESTS A REPORT. THEY INFORM HIM THAT THE U-BOAT'S SPEED IS UNKNOWN, IT'S RANGE UNCERTAIN. BUT THEY LATER ESTIMATE ABOUT THREE MILES. LAUNDERS DECIDES AGAINST THE SNAP ATTACK HE USED FOR U-771. HE NEEDS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE U-BOAT'S SPEED AND COURSE. HE RULES OUT USING ACTIVE SONAR. THIS REQUIRES SENDING OUT AUDIBLE PINGS TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION AND DISTANCE OF THE U-BOAT. DOWN PERISCOPE. ACTIVE SONAR GIVES YOU A GOOD FIX ON THE ENEMY. BUT IT ALSO MEANS THE ENEMY KNOWS YOU'RE THERE. THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR SONAR PASSIVELY. YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR HYDROPHONES, AS THEY'RE SOMETIMES CALLED, TO LISTEN FOR THE ENEMY. LAUNDERS THEN ORDERS VENTURER INTO POSITION BEHIND AND ON A PARALLEL COURSE TO THE U-BOAT, AT A CONSTANT SPEED OF 4 MILES AN HOUR. KNOWING THEIR OWN SPEED, AS THE CREW RECORDS THEIR PATH, THEY ALSO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE U-BOAT. IF HE ISN'T CHANGING COURSE AND IF HE'S GOING AT A CONSTANT SPEED, THEN THAT IS NOT A VARIABLE. LAUNDERS RISKS ANOTHER PEEK THROUGH THE PERISCOPE. HE'S SHOCKED TO SEE THAT THE U-BOAT STILL HAS ITS PERISCOPE UP. IN FACT, TO LAUNDERS, THE U-BOAT APPEARS TO BE USING BOTH THE ATTACK AND SEARCH PERISCOPES. LAUNDERS CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE HIS LUCK, BECAUSE HERE IS A GERMAN SUBMARINE SAYING, HELLO, I'M HERE. ONE WONDERS WHAT CONDITIONS WERE. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE HAD A VERY, VERY WORRIED GERMAN SUBMARINE COMMANDER WHO WAS HOPING TO GET SOME SUPPORT AND HOPING TO FIND IT. FOR A U-BOAT, THE STANDARD PROCEDURE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STAY SUBMERGED, SIMPLY TO EVADE DETECTION, HAVING A LOOK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH THE PERISCOPE IF THE ESCORT ARRIVES, THEN MAKING CONTACT AND GOING BACK TO PORT. HMS VENTURER CONTINUES TO TRAVEL AT 4 MILES PER HOUR. THE BRITISH SUBMARINE CLOSES IN ON THE U-BOAT. IT'S NOW ONLY ABOUT 2,000 YARDS AWAY. BUT AS LAUNDERS WATCHES, THE U-BOAT SUDDENLY TURNS WEST. LAUNDERS MUST ASSUME THE CREW OF U-864 HAS PICKED UP THE PRESENCE OF THE BRITISH SUB AND MAY BE PREPARING ITS OWN ATTACK. IT WAS QUITE A UNIQUE SITUATION. BOTH ARE SUBMERGED. AND NOW THIS GAME OF HUNTING STARTS. AND I THINK FOR BOTH COMMANDERS IT WAS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION, SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW. FEBRUARY 9, 1945. BRITISH SUBMARINE HMS VENTURER PURSUES GERMAN U-BOAT U-864 IN WATERS OFF NORWAY. THE U-BOAT'S NOISY ENGINE PROVES DOUBLY DANGEROUS. IT'S NOT ONLY THAT HE CAN BE HEARD VERY EASILY BY ENEMY CRAFT, BUT ALSO IT DIMINISHED YOUR ABILITY TO DETECT OTHER VESSELS, BECAUSE ALSO YOUR HYDROPHONES ARE BLOCKED BY THE NOISE OF THE ENGINE. DESPITE ENGINE NOISE ON BOARD, U- 864'S HYDROPHONES SEEM TO FINALLY PICK SOMETHING UP. HMS VENTURER CLOSES IN. U- BOAT COMMANDER WOLFRAM APPEARS TO REALIZE HE'S BEING PURSUED BY AN ENEMY SUBMARINE. SO HE APPLIES THE STANDARD METHOD FOR EVADING A TORPEDO ATTACK, WHICH IS ALSO USED BY ANY SURFACE VESSEL. HE STARTS TO ZIGZAG, TO CHANGE HIS COURSE FROM TIME TO TIME JUST TO PREVENT A TORPEDO ATTACK. THE ZIGZAG WORKS. THE PATTERN COMPLICATES THE TORPEDO FIRING SOLUTION FOR THE BRITISH SUBMARINE. WITH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF TORPEDOES, LAUNDERS CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE THAT HE WILL MISS. TO GET A SHOT AT THE U-BOAT, LAUNDERS MUST PREDICT THE PATTERN OF THE ZIGZAG. DOWN PERISCOPE. IT IS RISKY TO WAIT. LAUNDERS KNOWS THE U-BOAT'S STERN TORPEDOES ARE AIMED IN HIS DIRECTION. EVERY TIME IT TURNS, VENTURER IS DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH. BUT VENTURER CONTINUES TO TRACK THE U-BOAT, HOPING IT WILL SURFACE AND THEY CAN GET A CLEAR SHOT. BUT IT NEVER DOES. LAUNDERS PROBABLY HAS A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES OF THE GERMANS ARE IN THAT AREA. HE ALSO KNOWS THAT THE GERMAN MAY BE GIVING HIMSELF A CHANCE OF GETTING AWAY. THEREFORE, THERE IS SOME URGENCY IN CARRYING OUT THE ENGAGEMENT. LAUNDERS HAS TO ACT. THERE IS A CHANNEL NEARBY. IF THE U-BOAT REACHES THERE, IT WILL BE TOO EASY TO LOSE. LAUNDERS MUST FIRE ON THE U-BOAT WITHOUT VISUAL CONTACT. IT IS SOMETHING HE'S NEVER DONE BEFORE. THE GREAT PROBLEM FOR ANY SUBMARINE COMMANDER AGAINST ANY TARGET IS WORKING OUT WHERE THE TARGET IS GOING TO BE WHEN THE TORPEDOES ARRIVE. AND THAT CAN BE SOME TIME AFTER THE TORPEDOES ARE FIRED. LAUNDERS KNOWS THAT HUNTING A SUBMARINE IS MORE COMPLEX THAN HIS USUAL TARGETS. WHEN SHIPS ARE ON THE SURFACE, THEY MOVE FORWARDS OR BACK, LEFT OR RIGHT. THEY MOVE ONLY IN TWO DIMENSIONS. A SUBMERGED SUBMARINE ADDS A THIRD DIMENSION OF DEPTH TO THE CALCULATIONS. THIS IS A TARGET MOVING IN THREE DIMENSIONS. THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE DEPTHS AT WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO FIRE YOUR WEAPONS, AS WELL AS THE DIRECTION. IT'S PRETTY CHANCY. THE ODDS ARE AGAINST LAUNDERS. HE REALIZES THAT THE BRITISH MARK VIII TORPEDOES ARE VERY LOUD UNDERWATER ONCE THEY'VE BEEN FIRED. IF THE CREW ON BOARD THE U-BOAT HEARS THEM, THEY'LL HAVE TIME TO TURN AWAY, OR DIVE DEEP TO DODGE THE INCOMING WARHEADS. LAUNDERS HAS AN IDEA. IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT IT'S ALL HE'S GOT. MINUTES LATER, U-864 TURNS TO STARBOARD. IT'S TIME FOR LAUNDERS' PLAN TO GO INTO ACTION. UP PERISCOPE. PORT 15. HIS SUCCESS AND SURVIVAL DEPEND ON WHETHER HIS PREDICTIONS OF THE GERMAN U-BOAT'S BEHAVIOR ARE CORRECT. FIRE. FEBRUARY 9, 1945. IN THE NORTH SEA, ABOUT 2 MILES WEST OF THE NORWEGIAN ISLAND OF FEDJE, TWO SUBMARINES READY FOR WHAT COULD BE THE WORLD'S FIRST UNDERWATER SUBMARINE DOGFIGHT. ABOARD GERMAN U-BOAT U-864, RALF-REINER WOLFRAM ORDERS A SERIES OF TURNS TO THWART A TORPEDO ATTACK. BRITISH SUBMARINE COMMANDER LIEUTENANT JAMES LAUNDERS CALCULATES HOW TO SINK A SUBMERGED U-BOAT. IF HE CAN WORK OUT WHEN THE U-BOAT WILL TURN NEXT, HE CAN PLOT A TORPEDO-FIRING PATTERN THAT WILL INTERSECT WITH WHERE HE ANTICIPATES THE U-BOAT WILL BE. LAUNDERS THINKS, WITH HIS SUBMARINER'S INSTINCT, THAT ANY SUBMARINE COMMANDER, IF HE HEARS TORPEDOES IN THE WATER, IS GOING TO DIVE. THEREFORE HE WILL PUT AT LEAST ONE OF HIS TORPEDOES, IF NOT MORE, BELOW WHERE HE THINKS THE SUBMARINE IS ALREADY, BECAUSE THEN THE SUBMARINE WILL DIVE INTO THE TORPEDO. WHEN THE U-BOAT TURNS TO STARBOARD, LAUNDERS STARTS A TWO-MINUTE COUNTDOWN. UP PERISCOPE. HE HAD HIS MEN READY A SPREAD OF FOUR TORPEDOES. LAUNDERS HAS CREATED HIS PLAN TO WORK AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS TO CREATE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIRING PATTERN. HE GIVES THE ORDER. FIRE. THE FIRST TORPEDO ERUPTS FROM THE SUBMARINE. HARD STARBOARD! WOLFRAM GIVES THE ORDER TO EVADE- HARD TO STARBOARD AND DOWN. FIRE. THE SECOND AND THIRD TORPEDOES DART TOWARD THE U-BOAT. THERE'S ONLY ONE TORPEDO LEFT. FIRE. AND WOLFRAM HAS ALREADY GONE DEEP. THE FINAL TORPEDO STREAKS THROUGH THE WATER... AND SLAMS INTO THE U-BOAT'S SIDE. THE INRUSH OF WATER INTO THE SUBMARINE IS SO RAPID... THE U-BOAT'S FLOODED MIDSECTION IMMEDIATELY BECOMES HEAVIER THAN THE BOW AND STERN. THE U-BOAT SNAPS AND FALLS TO THE SEA FLOOR. ON BOARD VENTURER, LAUNDERS CAN'T TELL MUCH ABOUT THE HIT. HE KNOWS HE SUNK A PRETTY BIG TARGET. IT DOES SEEM TO BE CARRYING A LOT OF STUFF, WHICH COMES FLOATING TO THE SURFACE. THEREFORE IT COULD WELL BE A MILK COW, AS THEY CALLED THE SUPPLY SUBMARINES. THE MEN ABOARD VENTURER HAVE NO IDEA HOW IMPORTANT THEIR MISSION WAS. IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE ATTACK THAT THE BRITISH LEARNED THAT THEY HAD SUNK U-864 WITH ITS SECRET CARGO. INCLUDING THE CANISTERS OF MERCURY, WORTH ABOUT $5 MILLION, SETTLING ACROSS THE SILT. THE SINKING OF U-864 DOES NOT STOP THE AXIS EFFORT. IN MARCH 1945, GERMANY TRIES TO SEND ANOTHER U-BOAT CARRYING WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY TO JAPAN. BUT DURING ITS JOURNEY, EVENTS CHANGE RAPIDLY. THE SOVIETS LAUNCH A FINAL OFFENSIVE TO TAKE BERLIN. HITLER COMMITS SUICIDE. IN MAY, THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE GERMAN HIGH COMMAND SURRENDERS UNCONDITIONALLY TO THE ALLIES. TWO DAYS LATER, U- 234 RECEIVES A FINAL MESSAGE FROM GROSSADMIRAL DÖNITZ, TELLING HIS BELOVED U-BOAT ARM THE WAR IS LOST. THE CARGO OF U-234 WAS MORE SINISTER. A HALF-TON OF URANIUM OXIDE WOULD BE DISCOVERED ON BOARD WHEN IT SURRENDERS. THE WUNDERWAFFEN, OR WONDER WEAPONS, DON'T MAKE IT. JAPAN WILL CONTINUE TO FACE THE ALLIES ALONE IN THE PACIFIC. IN 2003, THE WRECKAGE FROM U-864 WAS LOCATED LESS THAN 2.5 MILES OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY, IN AROUND 500 FEET OF WATER. ITS CARGO ALREADY CONTAMINATED THE SEABED. THE DANGEROUS COMBINATION OF MERCURY AND THE EXPLOSIVES OF THE WEAPONS ON BOARD MAKE SALVAGE RISKY. THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO WORK TO MANAGE THE RISKS. THE SINKING OF U-864 IS THE ONLY ACKNOWLEDGED SUBMARINE-TO-SUBMARINE SUBMERGED KILL OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR. IN THE ROYAL NAVY, IN THE YEARS AFTER THE WAR, LAUNDERS WAS A LEGEND FOR HAVING PULLED OFF A REMARKABLE KILL. THE SINKING OF U-864 IS A MAJOR LANDMARK IN SUBMARINE WARFARE. IT IS THE COMING OF AGE OF THE SUBMARINE AS AN ANTISUBMARINE SYSTEM. AFTER THE WAR, ANTISUBMARINE OPERATIONS ARE GOING TO BECOME THE MOST IMPORTANT OPERATIONS OF THE BRITISH SUBMARINE FORCE AND MOST OTHER PEOPLE'S SUBMARINE FORCES. IT'S VERY MUCH A PIONEERING OPERATION. BY SHOWING IT CAN BE DONE, HMS VENTURER OPENS UP A WHOLE NEW CHAPTER, NOT JUST IN SUBMARINE WARFARE, BUT IN NAVAL WARFARE AS WELL.
