 Carnivàle (2003–2005): Season 1, Episode 3 - Tipton - full transcript 
 When the authorities of the cash-poor Oklahoma town of Tipton refuses to let the carnival set up show, Samson takes Jones' advice and temporally reinvents the troupe as a religious-revival show with Ben as the center act of a healer. In Mintern, Brother Justin's promise to the migrants of their new church upsets his regular congregation who despise the seedy people. Meanwhile, Ben and Sofie team up to continue to search for clues about his mysterious past when they meet with an ailing old woman outside Tipton who knew Henry Scudder, Ben's father.

 Beans, lard, flour. Milk and sugar, if they've got it. - Hey, boss. - Hawkins! Go with Jonesy. Pull her up a little tighter! Little more! This is a good town? Tipton? Never worked it. Don't y'all have a regular, you know, like.... - Circuit? - Yeah. Used to.

 Now it's just town by town, catch as catch can. That ain't hardly nothing. Since when? Since you showed up. That's right. Stake it down tight. We could be in for another blow. Jumping the gun a bit, ain't you? Lyle. What brings you out to these parts? Thought you was in Troy. Ma took sick. Come down to keep an eye on her. Got myself elected two years back. - l'll be damned. - l was the only fellow in the valley. Last fellow lit out with the contingency fund, four Colts, and a Thompson gun. - Did you catch him? - l will. - l sure would like that Thompson gun. - l'll bet you would. l guess you know l didn't come out here to jaw.

 l expect not. l tell you what, though. We're kind of skinny right now. Best we can do is 10 now, 10 on the gate. There ain't gonna be no gate. - OK, 20. - Not 10, not 20, not 30. l can't let you set up. That's just the way it is. l got to look after my people. Your people? What the hell you talking about, Lyle? These folks barely got a pocket to turn out. l'm not gonna let them get shook down. Shook down? We run a clean operation here and you know it. l know what kind of operation you run. Maybe next year. - How are you doing? - Howdy. - Got any milk? - No. No water. Cows are dehydrated. - How much for this corn? - What do you got? This ain't real corn. l'll give you a buck. There you go. Load it up back there. That's him, Grammy. - You're sure, baby? - Yes, ma'am. Glory be praised. He is the one. Saved my little Maddy. She was lame and he touched her and made her walk. - Oh, bless you, sir. - Now, come on. She's walking now because you touched her with your hands. - Jesus Christ, lady. - Hawkins, get in the truck. Hawkins, get in the truck. Come on, God damn it! Get in the truck. Don't go, now. Praise Jesus, brothers and sisters. Come hear the word of the Lord through His servant Brother Justin. Welcome! Praise the Lord! Welcome. Yes. That old-time religion, brothers and sisters, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of sin and degradation. Where there was once a den of flesh and debasement, there is now a glorious, shining temple dedicated to the Lord God Almighty. Amen. Now, there were those who laughed when we started our great mission. Men of the cloth, respectable learned men who said that the migrants had lost their faith. He said that the migrants believe that God has abandoned them. - So they in turn have abandoned God. - No. To them l say: who has more faith in God than those who have borne witness to His fury? - Amen, brother. - Who has more faith in God than the brother who has seen his land blow away in a tempest? - Praise the Lord! - Who has more faith than the sister who has buried her children in the hardscrabble left behind? Who has more faith than the families that wander in search of the promised land, from Kansas to Colorado, from New Mexico to Oklahoma? Well, thank you for coming. God bless. - lt's a miracle. lt is. - Not a miracle. Just a lot of hard work. Brother Justin? - Munson. Ned Munson. - Mr Munson. This is quite an operation you have here. - Very impressive. - Thank you. There is a lot of talk about this down at City Hall. People would like to meet you. Maybe you could give myself and the other councilman here the old nickel tour. - l suppose it would be an honour, sir. - lt would be our honour, Reverend. So we'll see you tomorrow? Ma'am. Well, well. Thank you for coming. Hawkins, grab that crate. Hey, boss, there's something funny about that rube. You should've seen it. People were coming up to him, calling him Jesus. Well, l don't really care about that right now. - What's going on? - Remember Lyle Donovan? - The cop. Yeah, he was a sport. - He's a son of a bitch now. Says he doesn't want us shaking down his people. His people, like he owns them. Hey, careful with that. What did the cop say? - He said we had to clear out. - No, before that. - He said we couldn't set it up. - The carnival, right? - The carnival. - Well, yeah. What, am l speaking Swahili? - A revival? - Yes, sir, Reverend. Sheriff Donovan's got us all wrong. We ain't been in the carny trade for a dog's age. You don't say. We all come to the Lord when a young stranger wandered into our midst. A powerful young healer named Benjamin St John. Perhaps you heard of him? He was in town earlier today. l understand he caused quite a stir. What we do, Reverend Goyer, is travel from town to town, preaching the Word, bringing hope where there is none, healing the lame, the sick, and the poor in spirit. For a small donation, of course. Of which a full 50% is contributed to the local churches. This is the only church in town, is it not? There's St Andrews just down the road. What say we let the Catholics take care of the Catholics? Step right up, step right up and witness the amazing Benjamin St John! Fresh from a triumphant tour of Bethlehem, Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Experience the Lord's healing touch through this latter-day prophet. Right this way. There's plenty of room for everybody. - God bless you, ma'am. - Thank you. - Hello, Lyle. - l told you to leave. You told me we couldn't set up a carnival show. This here's a revival. l don't give a tinker's damn what you call it. lt's a clip joint. Shut it down or l'm gonna shut it down for you. l wish l could, but if l did, we'd both have to answer to a higher authority. - The Lord? - No. The Bill of Rights. Freedom of religion. Don't you quote rights. You listen up, you shyster. Hello, Reverend Goyer. l'm so pleased that you could make it by. l wouldn't miss it for the world. - Hello, Lyle. - Tom. Fine night for a good old-fashioned revival. Just what the folks need. Little old-time evangelism, shake out the cobwebs, stir up the spirit. Right, Sheriff? Enjoy, Reverend. l'm telling you, this operation is 100% legit. l've never heard an honest man use the word " legit" . Hold still. - Let me see myself. - Not yet. Dear Lord. - This is dumb, forget it. - Easy, handsome. You're gonna be fine. Damn straw house. Got to hand it to Jonesy. Holy cow. - lt's like seeing a ghost. - Ain't it time you got ready? Who picked out this getup? - Something wrong with it? - lt was Lodz, wasn't it? - You're gonna knock them dead, kid. - l wanna see myself. - l ain't doing it. - Those are just butterflies. lt's only natural to be nervous. - l look like a damn fool. - You look like Valentino. - Doesn't he? - Spitting image. Forget it. That ain't an option. Welcome to the travelling St John Crusade and Revival. My name is brother Lazarus Dubois. l stand before you tonight as living testimony to the power, to the glory, and to the almighty love of Jesus Christ. Praise Jesus! Four years ago l was a salesman. A sinful man, full of lust and cheap hooch. Selling lightning rods door-to-door. Cheating good, honest farmers out of their hard-earned pay. Seducing their wives, seducing their daughters. l was a drunkard, l was a thief and l was an adulterer. l was a profane man ruled by profane desires with a one-way ticket to eternal damnation. When ironically l was struck down by a bolt of God's own blue fire from the sky. You said if l didn't feel 100% comfortable, you'd have Schmidt do it. lt's too late now. l don't even feel 50% comfortable. Listen up, boy. We've got the whole nut riding on this deal. - What if l foul up? - You ain't gonna foul up. All you gotta do is sit there looking cryptic. lt's automatic. When the man that you came to see here tonight laid his hands upon me and brought me back from the veritable edge of the abyss! Brothers and sisters, l give you the Right Reverend Benjamin... St John! Follow my lead, boy, you'll be all right. Reverend St John. Hallelujah! That was some cute trick. The tuxedo? ls he wearing it? You know goddamn well he is. lt is important, vitally important that you understand that unlike our Lord, Sir Reverend St John here is but a mortal man of flesh and blood. His constitution is such that he cannot lay his hands on but one poor soul a day. To do so otherwise could prove fatal. Brothers and sisters, is there anyone amongst you faithful who is in special need of Christ's healing power? Who is he? Who has a need? Where are you? We need one. Who? Wait a second. The woman in the wheelchair. The woman in the wheelchair in the back. Bring her up, boy. Give her a hand, young man, so that we may commence the healing. That's it, gentle, gentle with her, boys. Careful. Praise Jesus. This woman is injured. What is your name, sister? Gertrude. And what's ailing you, sister? l got stomach cancer. She's got stomach cancer. Doctor said it ate my backbone. So my legs don't work no more. lt's eating her backbone. Her backbone's gone. She cannot walk. Her legs, they are useless. Are you ready to be healed tonight, sister? - l sure do hope so. - Hallelujah. We need to put our hands together now. Repeat with me - " Jesus" . Jesus! Jesus! Lay your hands on her, boy. By the power of the Almighty God, by the power of the Son and the Holy Ghost, we command you, Satan's black cancer, to leave this woman and to make her healed! Gertrude, dear sister, l want you to walk to me now. Walk to me, Gertrude. l want you to stand out of that chair and walk to me. Walk, sister! Stand up and walk, sister! Stand up and walk to me! Come to me. Come on. Lord God, l'm healed! Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Turn that thing off, will you? - Ready, boss? - Let's go. Children! Children! Gather round. l have an announcement to make. Due to the unprecedented success of our new endeavour, no small thanks going to Master Hawkins, l'm pleased to announce Possum and Bobby, armed with ample greenbacks, have braved the 40-plus miles to Jefferson City and have procured fresh eggs. Bacon! And orange juice! Come and get it! Come on! - Good work, Hawkins. - Good job. Are the bugs extra? Hawkins, get the boys some more juice. - Congratulations. - l didn't do nothing. How's your ma? Better. Not great, but at least she's talking. That's good. - How's my boy? - Good. We got a morning show at 1 1 sharp. Morning service, l mean. You ready to knock 'em dead like last time? Hey, boss. l got something needs taking care of in town. Take the Chevy. Be back by 10, though. 10:30 at the latest. You're my goldmine, boy. Can't help you. What about Big Sky Farms? You know where that is? Can't say as l do. Thank you. You might wanna talk to Mrs Donovan. Used to be her truck. Pretty sure that fellow you saw bought it at the auction. Auction? Sad thing about the Donovans. Used to own half this here town. The only thing that she's got left now is that big old house and a shovelful of dust in her lungs. Where does she live? About 30 minutes south on Morrow. You can't miss it. You got the time on you? Quarter past 10. What the hell happened here? ls there a wreck? No. There's a healer up there. Healed an old lady with cancer last night, l heard. Look! That's him! That's the miracle man. That's Benjamin St John. Leave me alone. - Back off. - Please! Back off! And this is our main hall. At this point, we can seat almost 100. But once we get the pews finished, we'll be able to accommodate double. Double? This is our children's shelter. We should have room for about a dozen boys. The girls' dormitory across the hall is already complete. lris? This is City Councilmen Munson and Templeton. - My sister lris. - Hello. - Mr Templeton, was Carroll your cousin? - My nephew. You have our deepest sympathy. Without Carroll, none of this would've been possible. That's a real comfort. l'm amazed how much work you've put into the place. l just wish you'd come to us before. We'd appreciate the support you can lend in the future. We need all the help we can get. That's not exactly what l meant. Ned? l think what Val is trying to say is this whole block is slated for demolition. - Demolition? When? - Well, that's the old rub. City planner originally had it down for the Spring of '31 - but that was before the crash. - We took a real beating. - But we bounced back. Didn't l tell you... - Gentlemen. When? Middle of next month. - That is unacceptable. - Of course it is, Padre. You didn't think we were just gonna throw you out, did you? There is a big, old, empty roadhouse about five miles outside of town. lt's a nice piece of land. - lt's owned by Water and Power but... - No. - Don't be so hasty. - l'm not a fool, sir. l know this has nothing to do with city planning. lt's all about the migrants. The Okies. The Ginks. The Roadites. lt's fine while they're outside town but don't let them in. They might get a mind to stay, make it home. - Reverend, l think you've got us all wrong. - Shut up, Ned. Now, you listen to me, Reverend. We're offering you a nice piece of property in exchange for this cracker box. Or we can exercise eminent domain for fair market value, which l'd say, looking at this place, is about, l don't know, 50 bucks and a dead cow's fart? So what's it gonna be? Excuse me. Justin, wait! l know this place. Maybe we should... No. The Lord was clear. He spoke to me. He chose this place. No other. - But Justin... - No! - Val, you OK? - l can't breathe. Get a doctor! Let's take him outside. Easy. Watch his head. No. Don't ! Val? Sorry. Yeah, they're done. Who needs help? What kind of help? So now l'm his chauffeur? Come in. - l was wondering... - Yeah. Meet me in the Chevy. Hunker down under this. l'll get the keys. So, what's so important about this Mrs Donovan? lt's personal. What do you mean, personal? lt's family business. - Yes? - l'd like to see Mrs Donovan. l'm sorry, son, but Mrs Donovan is indisposed. lt's important. Well, l'll be. You're the miracle man. Come on in. We ain't got time to fritter. She's been waiting for you. Come along. Mrs Donovan, your man is here. l knew you'd come. Come and sit close, where l can see you. You got his eyes, boy. Walter. Why don't you show that young lady to the kitchen for a spot of lemonade? Yes, ma'am. Crazy old bird. When was the last time you seen him? A long time ago. Fifteen years or more. Old Hack Scudder and me. We got thick as thieves, we did. You know this woman? Of course l do. That's Flora. He showed me this picture. Told me about her. Good things. You heard from him since? Just dreams. You know that. Sent you one about me, Ben Hawkins. You got the gift. Just like him. You might not see it as a gift. You probably think it's more of a curse. The fact is, it's both. There's rules, boy. To give life, you gotta take it from something else. lt could be an acre of wheat. lt could be Walter's old bird dog, Jim. lt could be that little girl you brought in here. What the hell are you doing here? Get out of my house! - But... - l know what you're selling. l ain't buying. Yeah, that's right. Get! l don't suppose you're gonna tell me what that was all about? Family business? Yeah. So who was she? Aunt? Long-lost cousin? - Grandma? - Yeah, she was my grandma. You never saw that woman before in your life. She said you had " his eyes" . Whose eyes? Get out. - What? - You heard me. - What do you want from me? - l want to know who the hell you are. What you did to my mother. - l told you, l didn't do... - You're a liar! Crazy damn bitch! What did you call me? l called you a crazy damn bitch. - Get in. - Go to hell. Are you sure he ain't around someplace? Nobody's seen hide nor hair of him since the last show. Damn it. God damn it! Lila, get Schmidt ready for the show. Do you think they'll buy it? These birds? They'll buy anything. Can l have a cigarette? Can l drive? ls there any of you fine folks here tonight in special need of Christ's healing power? Pick me! You there. You, sister, on the end. Why don't you help her up, boy? Help up our little sister. Praise Jesus! - Let me help you up. - You up. - And what is your name, little sister? - Verna. Oh, my God! What misfortune has befell you, sister Verna? l got runned over by a thrasher. Gracious! Lord, girl! You are lucky to be alive. l thank the Lord Jesus Christ every day. - Praise the Lord! - Do you hear that, folks? This poor little crippled girl thanks Jesus just for sparing her life. Now, isn't that inspirational? Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord! Sweet sister Verna, are you ready to be healed tonight? No! By Jesus, you're gonna heal my ma, you son of a bitch. Sorry, Sheriff. We've chosen this young lady here to be healed. - You can bring her tomorrow. - She ain't got till tomorrow. - Heal the girl tomorrow. - Heal Becca! You ain't him. - That ain't him. - No! Where's the healer? - Where is he, goddamn it? - l'm here. Set her down. Don't die. l need to know them rules. l don't wanna have to hurt nobody. Stand back. You gotta get back. No. Don't touch me. You all saw? She don't want to be healed. She doesn't want it! Henry Scudder. When he left you, where did he go? Babylon. Mom? What if she hadn't stopped you? What? You was making like to lay hands on that woman. So my question to you is, what if she hadn't stopped you? What was you fixing to do? That's what l thought. You're shovelling shit. lt's latrine duty. No more headlining. l didn't ask for it. You ain't gonna get it, not till you earned it. Maybe not even then. OK, children, start 'em up. We got dust to shake. Where are we headed? Stay on 54. Pick up Route 66 to 27 south. Through Texas? That's gonna take us awful close to Babylon. No, it's gonna take us to Babylon. Jesus Christ. Yeah. On a bicycle. English
