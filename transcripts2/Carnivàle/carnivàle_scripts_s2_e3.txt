 Carnivàle (2003–2005): Season 2, Episode 3 - Ingram, TX - full transcript 
 When Carnivale sets up show in Ingram, Texas, Ben sets out to find some people who knew Scudder and stumbles into a bizarre moonshiners' camp, which proves both painful and revealing. Meanwhile, Stroud continues his quest to find Scudder by investigating the mining accident in the ghost town of Babylon. At Carnivale, Sofie still refuses to read Ben's future through the tarot cards, but the cards soon reveal something without Sofie's assistance. Ruthie's luck with her snake charming skills seem to be turning against her. Stumpy pitches Rita Sue and Libby to an underage audience, and he later gets a visit from a menacing bookie looking to collect. In Mintern, Tommy Dolan continues his investigation into the arson incident. Brother Justin takes the catatonic Reverend Balthus under his wing, as well as takes advantage of his young and naive new housekeeper, Celeste.

 We already went over this, Mr. Dolan. I went over it with you, now with your brother. - Justin? - Not a single soul will be turned away. For Pete's sake, Justin, you know the only reason a lot of them are here is for a hot meal. Then they will be fed. It's not just the food. A lot of these people might be criminals. There's a lot of money pouring in. "Maybe they're looking for an angle--" Damn it! They're not all here to be saved, brother Justin. They've come because they were called, Mr. Dolan. I need them all.

 "Everything seems worse when I'm trying to sleep." I smelled smoke. It wasn't a dream. It wasn't. Sometimes I wonder if all this ain't the dream. If it is, I want to wake up. You should do that more. I was wondering... If you wanna do one of those readings with the cards. It doesn't work without mama. We could give it a shot. I don't do that anymore. Do me a favor, get the cards. Burn them. Take them out of my place and burn them. I don't ever want to see 'em again. I take it you'll be needing a truck. Yeah. Been in Ingram a week. A shit burg like this... It ain't worth a day. What're you sayin'? If we stick around much longer, they're gonna start grousing. - You tell him I'm doing the best I can. - He knows that. Then why you crawling up my hoop about it? I've been all over this place. I ain't found nothing. It's not like Kerrigan gave me a road map. All right, I'm just asking. There's some ranch roads in the hills. I'm gonna run them out, see what's what. I'll tell him. Kid... Watch your back. Is that coming from you or him? It's both of us. Turn off that damned Squawk-O-Dyne. "Drink Moxie, the only soft drink "with the genuine Moxie taste." Moxie, the only soft drink you'll ever crave. And now, ladies and gentleman, Lend a kind ear, as we bring you Brother Justin's Saturday morning "Church of the Air"! Good morning, brothers and sisters. I was just making some notes a few moments ago. "And you'll never believe what I was thinking about. "I was thinking about... Salt." In many ways, salt might appear to be a curse from above. The salt from the sweat of our back-breacking labors. "The salt from the tears of a child gone hungry. "The salt rubbed unmercifully into the lash marks left by the whip." The oceans themselves, great bodies of water, that might irrigate this withered land, but cannot. And why? Because they are poisoned with salt. "And yet... We know "that it is not a curse; "It is a blessing. "A mere pinch kills the writhing slug "that ravishes our garden, "the leech that sucks our lifeblood. "And let us not forget, brothers and sisters, "the salt upon our tables," pure and white, that increases our enjoyment of God's simple bounty. "You mind?" - What happened? - They've been skittish. One of them must've bit the others... Or they got sick. Who knows why some things die? Why you been ducking me, Ben? I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah? Then why won't you even look at me? If I did something to you, or said something, you stand up like a man, Ben Hawkins, and you tell me. Don't you hide from me like you hide from everything else. I ain't hiding from you. Well, you're doing a pretty good impersonation. Okay, I don't want to be around you. Satisfied? You're scared of something. The only thing scares me is folks using other folks to use me. You think I want to use you? For what? Forget it, God damn it. It ain't even about you! Just forget everything. You said it-- Some things die; Some things don't. I can't keep up this pace, Felix. Oh hell, this ain't nothing. You got us putting out from noon till sunday. Well, this one here's a special fellow. Truth be told, he's an alderman, could be mayor of Ingram some day. I thought it would make... Make pretty good sense for the future, is what I thought. You're full of shit, as usual. Okay, then. I'll send him on his way. No matter. You say the word. I'm all... Messed up down there. Just get out of here. Get! Hey, Sofie! Did you do like I asked? Yeah, I burned them. Except this one. What's it mean? Never seen it before. It was in there with the others. Well, I've seen every one a thousand times. It's not one of mine. It was in there with the others! Then burn it! Welcome home, Norman. Hey, Jones. Libby. - Here, I got it. - No, don't. No, no. It's all right. Put her there. There you go. "Hey, Jonesy." How you doing there, buttercup? - How come you ain't inside? - Commerce. "Since when'd your mama ply her trade before the crack of noon?" Ask her squealing johnnie. I could use an extra pair of hands on colossus. Hell, you got four guys on there now. Three guys. "She seems to be holding her own. "It ain't her. It's the rest of them." They don't like it. - Since when does that cut ice? - Plus she don't know jack. So? Osgood don't know how to find his pecker if the light isn't on. He manages. Look, if you're angling to get her ass canned, You're hunting with the wrong dog. I like her. Hell, Samson! It's your show-- And it's your crew! You wanna can her, don't even talk to me. You handle it! Watch it up there! Sorry. Little late in the day for breakfast. Honey pie, I could eat breakfast three times a day. Give a holler if there's anything else. One thing-- The night of the fire at the mission, you saw the car. Damned vulture. You want a story, talk to the cops. It's over. Why don't you give it a rest? You know, a young lady came to me the other day, No older than you, I'm sure. "She was a good christian who had been in a bad way." An unwed mother, had to give her baby up a few years back. She'd gotten her life back on track and told me I could interview her If I could just find out if her baby aas among those who perished in the Mintern fire. I had to tell her he was. Me, not the cops. Now, what I couldn't tell her was that the flesh of those children roasted so black, it fell raight away from their little bones when they tried to move them. "Let it rest" ? "How do you suppose she rests?" How do you suppose those kids are resting? He was slumped down. Slumped down, or not very tall? I couldn't see him. You're sure it was a him? "Could it have been a woman?" Yeah. Yeah, it might have been. Just one more thing-- Toast. I asked for wheat toast. Dry. Yeah. Howdy, friend. You know somebody around these parts called the Crone? "Take this road for a couple of miles," and right up yonder, the road splits. "You bear right," Then you will be on Old Cherry Blossom road. You go till you see a house. How do I know the house? Ain't but one. Hey, hey, hold up a mite, friend. Here. Come on out. I need to show you something. - What? - Well, come on out. I won't hurt you. Go on. Show him. What the hell you do that for? She's abnormal. A retard. "But she don't complain." Won't tell nobody. Back of your truck for $2. She's tight. I'm sorry. Don't do that no more. No, I won't. Ever again. /* Just me and my shadow */ /* All alone and feelin' blue... */ Henry Scudder. Look at you. /* And when it's 12:00 */ /* We climb the stairs. */ /* We never knock */ /* 'Cause nobody's there. */ /* And when it's 12:00 */ /* And we climb the stairs. */ /* We never knock */ /* For there's nobody-- */ Whoop! There. You know, I can remember... Sitting at your knee at the pergola in the cool spring evenings while you read your Bible. Open. Good. I remember trying to lift it. It seemed too heavy for one person to hold. You know the first word I could read in english-- Open. --was from your Bible. It was "Garden." Remember? "Oh, it's going to listen, Norman. "The radio tower alone will be over 200 feet tall." Did I tell you what Tommy Dolan said? He said, In a single coast-to-caost broadcast... I will speak to more souls than our Lord did in his entire lifetime. It's going to be breathtaking. That's right, gentlemen, step right up in close to witness the plush, rich texture of womanhood seldom seen. Plenty of room, boys. Step on in. You ain't gonna like this, mama. C'mon boys.

"Fret not, gentlemen," where your imagination will take you. It takes you to a land where only pleasure resides. - You been swigging wood alcohol again? - What?
