 2x07 - Damascus, NE. Inseam-- 31. 32 and a half. You did it incorrectly. 31. 32 and a half. There's been a mistake. The whole back of the suit is split open. That's how we dress a corpse. It's a funeral suit. Are you sure I can't get you the mercurochrome? - I will only take a moment. - It's nothing, ma'am. I'll get it looked at after we drop her off.

 Is everything all right, Iris? Is it Norman? Our new maid-- bad case of nerves. This is a pleasant surprise. Will you be joining us for breakfast? Do I smell bacon? Hey! You like pork? Your hog's utensil is shaped like his tail, Like a... corkscrew. Henry Scudder. Hey, Jonesy. Take whatever you want. The girl hardly had anything anyway. Everyone I talked to said they thought it was a long time coming.

 It's a miracle she stayed around as long as she did. After she lost her mama. I thought you would be happy for her. I am. Some people are meant for this life, and some ain't. Look at you. You were born in the carnival. Come on. Let's go work on those steps. Light me a cigarette. The boy will be back soon. Then what? Leave me. Goodbye, Samson. You know where to find me. Is he still under that thing's thumb? You ever seen him? Management? And he's still playing that Punch and Judy act? Always behind a curtain, always running off the goddamn circuit. What makes me sick-- when we set up in a burg like this, where you know nobody's got two nickels to rub together. It was the same back then. We all go back a long way. What was it like with Samson? He was always so picky about his suits. Never let me touch him when he was sleeping, That was a rule. Never kissed me in front of people. We used to fuck like rabbits. When I feel like I'm gonna nod off with Bert flopping around on top of me, I think of him sometimes. Not everything on him is small. Five, six, seven, eight. And back, step, Turn, and back. No! No. Do everything I do, like a mirror! It don't work if you don't do what I do. Then it ain't a mirror, is it? It ain't a mirror. It's just shit! Well, it's hard looking at you and imagining I'm looking in a mirror, mama. Well, you are. Felix, what the hell are you doing back there? Hey, how about some more of that liquid sunshine there, doc? What the hell is this? - Who is this quack? - He's not a quack! This is the renowned traveling Weimar oralist. Dr. Delichter, from Oesterreich. He's gluing back in that crown Jonesy popped loose with that lucky punch of his. Guten morgen, frau Dreifuss. He says "Guten morgen." Jonesy knocked loose more than a crown. We barely have a pot to piss in because of you. And now you're wasting money on your goddamn tooth? We'll work something out. Ah, delicious. Yes. Good food, good company. But surely there must be another reason for your visit besides the temptation of my sister's bacon. It's the supervisory, Justin. Members are disturbed by some of the theology you've been expounding. Now I am your greatest champion, but even I have found some of your more recent speeches to be... divisive, - Confrontational. - Confrontational? That was never my intention. Just tell me what I need to do to make you and the supervisory more at ease. Well, we'd like you to submit your radio sermons to us for approval before broadcast. That way we can make suggestions. You may even benefit from our collaboration. I think that's a splendid idea. Such attention would be an honor. Well, thank you again, Iris. That was delicious. Yes, thank you. Delicious. It's Norman! Don't worry. I'll take care of it. How is Norman? Is there any improvement? Sadly, no. If we are to believe Dante, the ninth circle of Hell, being frozen in ice for eternity is reserved for those who betray their benefactors. If that's the worst that hell has to offer, then there must be as special a place in Heaven, reserved for you and your sister, The way you've treated that man. He saved us both. It's the least we could do. I just can't see him like this. - I know. - Give him my regards? Of course. Does he understand when you speak? I pray he does. I'll have tonight's radio address right sent over. Good. Goodness, what happened here? If your spasms are going to be throwing you out of bed, we just might have to put up some rails. There's a proverb in Russia that our mother taught us. "It's better to be a wounded lion than an impeccable flea." Justin has been under so much pressure lately. He has so much to worry about that he can't really worry about us anymore. His stride is so long. If we can't keep up with him, we'll look up one day, and, poof, he'll be gone. Now I intend to do everything it takes not to be left behind. I am not a flea. Time for a change. I'm looking for a man named Scudder. Henry. Hank. Hack. That bastard? If you're a friend of his, you pay in advance. He live here? For about a year. He snuck out on Christmas eve owing eight weeks' rent. Lord. You know where he went to? If he's smart, he's a thousand miles away. He was a freak, nothing but a freak. Can I see his room? Been rented-- to paying tenants. He didn't leave anything behind. Around the stairs to the left. Room two. The door is always open. Buying or looking? You ever hear of a fella named Scudder? Nope. Who are you? I'm your mother. Yeah, I'm your aunt Claudine. Hey, if you're gonna puke, you take it outside. I know you. God damn! You got to pay for that. This is the hotel Astoria. I was wondering if you could send a car to-- Hey, what are you doing? You can't come back here! This isn't the farm, you little shit. That behavior doesn't fly here. This is Damascus! Operator, get me the police. Yes. Hello? Henry Scudder? Who? You're him. You're gonna have to pay for that too. You know why I'm here. I'm taking you back to Belyakov. You can't come back here! Leave that man alone. Don't touch him, you son of a bitch! You're wrong. I don't know who you are. And I don't know who you're looking for. You know who I am. I'm your son! - Where did he go? - Are you the police? Yeah, I'm the police. He's back there. He locked the door. Well, we'll see what we can do about that! I have a key! No! What are you doing? What are you--? It is. So it is. Justin, are you all right? What a day to lose the maid. I've spent years... wondering where you was, what you was like. Here you are, a shriveled up old coward. Why did you leave us? I had no choice. Belyakov was getting close, Lodz was in town asking questions. So the you just-- you turn tail, you leave us there with nothing? The russian wouldn't have hesitated killing you and your mother to get to me. That's a load of crap. He ain't that way. I don't have to justify myself to you or anybody else. I just did what I had to do. You left me there, alone with a goddamned crazy woman! I never wanted to be a part of this madness. I-- I just wanted peace and a family, but you can't just up and quit. You can't run away from who you are. But then-- you know that. Yeah. I wish to hell that you didn't have to be part of this, that I could just make it all stop, but I can't. No one can. Belyakov means to kill me. He's a broken down, half-dead old man. Until his last breath, he is extremely dangerous. He ain't gonna hurt you, I promise. What if you're wrong? I ain't wrong. If you're wrong, will you protect me? Yeah, I will. Come in. I brought you some chowder. Oh, you shouldn't have. So... You remember anything? Anything at all? I must have been sleepwalking is all I can think. Yeah. What did I say to you? Oh-- Just talking about the boy. But, it wasn't so much what you said, It was your expression or-- What do you call it? The way someone holds themself? Bearing? Bearing. It was your bearing. I must have been the one who was dreaming. So are you finally happy now? About what? You don't have to worry about Sofie working for you no more. I guess that's what you wanted, right? What are you getting at? She was a sweetheart, for Christ's sake. She was family. She was our family, Simpoleon. Tell me how to get her back, I'll go do it. This was her whole world. What the hell's she gonna do out there? A girl like that is pure prey. She can take care of herself! I only wanted what's best for her. Yeah, sure you do. - Glenn, you run it. - All right, Jonesy. Go ahead, take it off! Don't stop now. Hey, hey, gentlemen! Where you going now? The best is still to come. Gentlemen, here. Please. It's like watching nature unfold. That's it. That's it, gentlemen. Yeah. There she is. Good evening, brothers and sisters. "In the garden of Gethsemane "the Lord struggled with His own doubts "about His destiny." I approved it this afternoon, after I called Justin with some changes. In the future, we'll be receiving the text a week in advance of air-time, so that we can all make revisions. "... but He wasn't alone. "Likewise, we are never alone..." In the garden. "That was the sound of the sermon "other men would have me deliver. "Brothers and sisters, I realize now "that you are not here to listen to the words of other men. "You are here for me "so that I am not alone in the garden." This is the sound of outrage. Outrage at deluded men who would presume with all the arrogance of the papacy to tell you, to dictate to you how you should worship, what you should think! But have pity on these men, because they were not always what they have become. Before these modern day pharisees became the fat filthy pawns of a godless merchant regime, they were all righteous and holy men. "But what is the devil himself if not a fallen angel?" This is the sound of indignation at men who would betray you, men plotting against you, men trying to tear down what we are building here, turning their backs as the roman centurions forced their way into our garden-- Deaf to the clatter of their spears and their swords. But I am not alone in the garden! When Jesus had 12 at his side, I will have 12,000! Shit! And they will know that when they come-- And they will come! They will come, brothers and sisters. They will come. In this garden... You will never hear the words of other men. You will only hear the words of one man. One man inspiring you to live! And that is the sound that they will fear! - Wait. - What? - Put it back there. - What? Put it back there. Are you-- Are you gonna like that? I've never tried. I just don't want you going where the johnnies go. I want it to be special. - You seen Samson? - Nope. He told me to get him when the kid came back. Might be down there. I got to go-- No, you don't. You're still tight. You were never this wound up when we were together. - What about Bert? - Mm, sleeping. Nothing gets him up. - Nothing? - Hmm. You can't just stand here. Come on. I'm glad we had these hours, son. I know it doesn't make up for anything, but... There's plenty more time we're gonna have. He's just gonna talk to you... That's all. Come to me. Belyakov. Scudder. Here we are. I'm not a part of this. I never was. I took myself out a long time ago. I just want to live my life in peace. Why couldn't you stop too? You know what we need to know. Give us the name of Ben's enemy. - No. - Give it to me! What's going on? - Open your mind, Scudder. - Stop it! Open your mind or I'll tear it apart. Stop it, god damn it! Ah--Alexsei! Alexsei. Alexsei Belyakov. Your son. You lie. My son is dead. He died in a train derailment. No. He's the boy's opposite. He has a man looking for me, and he's not dead. - No! - Let him go! - Help me! - Let him go! Stop, god damn it! Stop! - Son! - You're killing him. What are you doing? He didn't want you to interfere. He wanted to protect you. He? Who's he? It's Management! It's Management, isn't it? What have you done? Subtitles: Lama & Raceman - www.forom.com -
