 [Suspenseful music] [speaking in Mandarin] [man] "If you grow good garlic, people will love you for it. In fact, you can grow even fair garlic or even rather cosmetically-inferior garlic, and people will still compliment you for your pains." [narrator] Every year, humans consume nearly 50 billion pounds of garlic. [man] Because garlic has gone to something that's essential to cuisines, it's gotten sexy. [narrator] The spicy bulb generates some $40 billion of global revenue a year.

 It's like winning a lottery. [narrator] And most of it comes from one country: China. [in Mandarin] In today's market, you can make a lot of money. [narrator] Today, this global trade is the backdrop for a pitched battle over garlic profits. Allegations of forced prison labor... [man] Almost all this stuff goes to America. It's amazing. It's unbelievable. [narrator] ...accusations that a Chinese garlic juggernaut is scheming with an American ally... They're big and they fight mean.

 [narrator] ...and two small-time farmers in New Mexico who dared to take on big garlic. [woman] If we had known what we know now, we would never have gotten involved to start with. [tense orchestral music] [insects chirping] [birds tweeting] [engine chugging] [man] I consider growing your own food almost a revolutionary act. You're free of the very complex social and industrial and commercial systems that, now, really enwrap our lives. My name is Stanley Crawford and I'm a farmer and writer in Dixon, New Mexico, northern New Mexico. Our current operation is quite small. We're an acre and a half in garlic and shallots. We sell almost exclusively at the farmers' market. Come on. -[Stanley] Rosemary? -[Rosemary] Yeah. [narrator] Stanley Crawford and his wife Rosemary settled near Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1968. [dog barking] [Rosemary] Is it really wet out there, Stan? No. It's just dripping. We grew a garden, which was the most physical work I'd ever done. And it kept getting bigger and bigger. By the end of the '70s, we were farming full-time. When we started growing garlic in the late '70s, garlic was coming into fashion in a wider sense. [to "Money" from Cabaret] ♪ Garlic is the spice of life ♪ ♪ The spice of life The spice of life ♪ [Stanley] When Les Blank's film came out, I think that was a good marker for the expansion of garlic into other culinary types. You know, I don't want to have just... pesto. I mean, I want garlic. I mean, you know, garlic. [narrator] In the 1990s, as The Food Network's influence grew, more home chefs than ever before began cooking with garlic. Happy, happy, happy. Garlic, garlic and more garlic. [narrator] That's when Crawford published a memoir of his adventures in garlic: A Garlic Testament. [woman]  Way back when I was a freshman in college, I read this book called A Garlic Testament by Stanley Crawford, and I became really enchanted with the way of life described in that book. And we actually drove up to the Santa Fe Farmers' Market one year, just to see Stanley Crawford, and just to buy his garlic. What do you think, Kristen? Look at all the worms. One thing with healthy soil is, if you have worms... You see, this is full of worms. Worms are a good thing. [man] We're a small organic farm, with garlic always having been our main crop. [Kristen Davenport] Garlic brought us together in a lot of ways. I mean, we knew each other before garlic, but garlic was what cinched it, really. -You grew garlic. -I grew garlic. That was cool. Yeah! [narrator] It was garlic that these two farming families had in common. And it was garlic that would ultimately drive them apart. [Stanley] "In an age that has littered the planet with permanent garbage and toxic waste, there is much to be said for basing a living on crops, which by definition submit readily to the forces of decay and whose immortality is of another kind, lying rather in the endless passage through cycles of life and death." [narrator] For years, those cycles repeated on both New Mexico farms. Then, in 2014, Stanley Crawford got a surprise visit from an out-of-town attorney and his wife. [man] We do this on Sunday mornings. Every Sunday morning, we have pancakes. My name is Ted Hume. For the last 40 years or more, I've been practicing international trade law. [narrator] Part of Hume's business was helping Chinese garlic companies navigate US trade law. He told Crawford that two of the most powerful garlic companies in the world were on the verge of taking over the whole industry, and he wanted to stop them. To do that, he would need an American garlic grower to sign on to his cause. [Ted] My first meeting with Stanley was quite marvelous. Little did I expect that he would understand things so quickly. [Stanley] The moment they walked in, I thought, "I like these people." And I also, in a short while, said to myself, "I trust them." [narrator] As Hume explained to Stanley, the soaring demand for garlic in the US had opened the door to the world's garlic powerhouse: China. [Ted] China is the largest producer, by far, of garlic, and hence, the lowest cost producer in the world. [driving orchestral music] [narrator] In fact, China grows around 90% of all the garlic consumed in the entire world. [in Mandarin] These products in a can are the domestic main sales. Black garlic in a jumbo pack, 500 grams. Here is a product we just introduced to the market... black garlic drink. It has very nice packaging. These are two packages of garlic for export. They are designed especially for the American market. [narrator] Most Chinese garlic is grown here, in Shandong Province. Shandong is one of the major agricultural production provinces in China. In Shandong, you can see the good quality of the fresh garlic. [interviewer] Why do you pull the garlic stems? [in Mandarin] After pulling the stems, the garlic heads start to grow bigger... Now the garlic leaves are grown and ready to sell. [Ruopeng Wang] The garlic growers, the farmers, earn their money steadily. They have a relatively stabilized percentage of income of the profit, through growing, harvesting. [in Mandarin] Buyers come to our house to purchase the garlic. [interviewer] Do you know where the garlic buyers are selling to? [in Mandarin] The good ones are exported, to be processed and exported. [man in Mandarin] he Communist party negotiates with foreign countries. Now the president of the party is friendly with foreign countries. The garlic sells well. When the garlic sells well, the price is high. I have been through hard times, and now, as an old man, I am enjoying life. [narrator] Between 1995 and 2009, to feed the growing demand, the amount of garlic imported from China to the US skyrocketed. [man] You see, the garlic skin is purple. And this garlic is spicy. Spicier than pure white garlic. [narrator] By 2010, Chinese garlic accounted for a whopping 41% of all garlic consumed in the US. [Du Jiayi] You see this garlic is a big size. It's good. And we can export. [narrator] But this cheap Chinese garlic raised the specter of "dumping": selling a foreign product in the US at an unfairly low price, undercutting the domestic industry. Every year, the Department of Commerce conducts a review of Chinese garlic exporters. The companies found to be dumping are saddled with a steep tax: an "anti-dumping duty." [tense music] [narrator] Over time, one garlic company caught Ted Hume's attention: Harmoni International Spice, Inc. Harmoni had offices in China and California, allowing them to act as both exporter and importer of Chinese garlic. [Ted] Harmoni is bringing in something like $8.5 million dollars every month, on average, so they're running roughly $100 million of garlic every year. They're the largest Chinese exporters, by far, now. [narrator] According to Ted, the reason for their success was troubling. [Ted] You're finding that they are the only company that avoids being subject to dumping duties while every other Chinese garlic exporter is subject to substantial duties. From my perspective, the playing field wasn't level. [narrator] Ruopeng Wang is a trade consultant in China who specializes in anti-dumping cases. He agreed to help Ted look more closely at Harmoni's business. [speaking Mandarin] [narrator] Ted and Ruopeng concluded that Harmoni was not acting alone. We need some garlic. Talking about Harmoni's export activities within these several years, a dozen years, without paying any anti-dumping duty, we've got to talk about the Fresh Garlic Producers Association. [narrator] The Fresh Garlic Producers Association, or FGPA, was formed to stand up for the interests of American garlic companies against increasing imports from China. It was a powerful voice for the US garlic industry. The biggest member of the group is a company called Christopher Ranch. [advertising jingle music] [Ted] Christopher Ranch is the largest distributor, wholesaler, marketer of garlic in the United States. It's the Walmart of the business. [crowd] Three, two, one... [cheering] [narrator] One of the founders of the Gilroy Garlic Festival in 1979, Christopher Ranch had become the friendly face of the American garlic business. OK, come on, Luce. Luce! Come on. [Ted] What we found out is, the Fresh Garlic Producers Association is Christopher Ranch. They reflect whatever Christopher Ranch wants them to do. [narrator] Ted also believed that Christopher Ranch was using the FGPA to exploit a gaping loophole in the system. It's the Department of Commerce that reviews foreign companies for dumping. But Commerce allows members of the US garlic industry to decide which exporters get reviewed. And for many years, the Fresh Garlic Producers Association repeatedly took one company's name off of the review list: Harmoni. Under the law, companies can pick and choose who's going to be reviewed. It's essentially a self-regulating system. [narrator] And according to Ted, the Fresh Garlic Producers Association didn't want Harmoni reviewed for dumping, because their most powerful member, Christopher Ranch, was one of the biggest buyers of Harmoni's garlic. Ted claims the arrangement guaranteed Christopher Ranch a reliable flow of cheap Chinese garlic, that they could then sell all across the United States. [Ted] They were making millions and millions of dollars bringing in the Harmoni garlic and never paid any dumping duties either. That's the concern. That's gaming the system. It's not that what they're doing is illegal, but they've avoided being in a review, and we think that their affiliation with the FGPA is essentially a cartel, and it costs American jobs. That has been our argument from day one. [narrator] Ted and Ruopeng say it also hurt the bottom line of other Chinese garlic companies, who were stuck paying enormous anti-dumping duties. Some of them were Ted and Ruopeng's clients. [Ruopeng] So year after year, all the other Chinese exporters will have to participate in the normal review. Well, Harmoni did not. Because all the US markets of the garlic from China were dominated by Harmoni and Christopher Ranch. And the other Chinese exporters and producers, they have no way to ship their merchandise into the US. This is their problem. [narrator] To Ruopeng and Ted, the garlic industry seemed on the brink of a takeover by two of its biggest players: Harmoni and Christopher Ranch. [Ruopeng] It's better for consumers to have more options. They can choose to buy garlic from whatever they would like to buy. And of course, the competition involves not only the price, but also the quality of the product. Competitive prices are favorite to the consumers. [narrator] So Ted and Ruopeng decided they would file their own request with the Department of Commerce to review Harmoni's practices, with the hope of forcing them to pay anti-dumping duties. The only option that I saw, if we were going to address Harmoni, would be to find somebody in the US as a domestic interested party, a company, a farmer or producer, who would be willing to file an administrative review request. [narrator] But when Ted looked in California, where 89% of all US garlic is grown, he found no takers. [Ted] Virtually everybody in California is connected with a member of the FGPA, of which the principal player was Christopher Ranch. You really don't want to get involved. I mean, these guys are very big. They're major players in this market and Harmoni is a major, major supplier for them. [narrator] And that's what ultimately brought Ted Hume to New Mexico. [Stanley] He said he was looking for a domestic producer of garlic to file a request for review. And he said, "No risks and no costs." We are all involved in international trade, the moment we walk into Walmart, the moment we walk into Dollar General. So this is something that we should understand. And this garlic anti-dumping thing was a pathway into understanding that world. So, I said, "Sure, sure. I'll do that." [narrator] As it turned out, Stanley's participation would also involve a small token of appreciation from Ted, in the form of a check for $50,000. [Ted] We appreciated how much time and effort Stan had put into this, so it was more or less just a kind gesture for his participation. [Stanley]  Even without this, I would have continued, because I think the process is both important and interesting. ♪ I am a man ♪ ♪ Of constant sorrow ♪ The big question is what you might call "economic justice." Because this one company is able to import garlic and pay no anti-dumping duty, they can undercut everybody in this country. [narrator] To give their side a little more muscle, Ted and Stanley decided to get one more American garlic-grower on board. Fortunately, there was one right up the road. [Avrum Katz] We have a friend who brings us garlics from different parts of the world. This one is called Music. It's garlic which originated in the Caucasus Mountains, which is where all garlic originated. [Kristen] Ted Hume told us that if this review went through, and if Avrum Katz and Stanley Crawford were found to have standing, to be producers of a like product, that Harmoni would be reviewed and then be assessed a tariff. And this would level the playing field for all growers. Actually there are varieties that originated in China. Like, here's one that's called Lotus, but it's really good, really tasty. I knew them, and mainly Avrum, as a fellow competitor at the farmer's market. Our stands were 50 feet apart, and so we would always kind of eye each other's goods and wonder what we were charging. But you know, it was a cordial relationship. I think that I started out very much trusting Stan Crawford, because I trusted his writing. So, how do you want this? [Avrum] Part of the story was that this company Harmoni, the big, evil, corporate giant, was gaming the system with the FGPA. [Kristen] Come on, guys. Come on out. Don't lose your buddies. [Kristen] We definitely, in our politics and personal belief systems, are always on the side of the little guy. You could characterize us as liberals, as Bernie Sanders people. [whooping] [Kristen] And so we probably fell into this a little more easily than some other people would, because of that underlying belief system. One of the things I thought is that we could be helping farmers in China, too. If you took us and the farmers in China, we would have the most in common, through this whole thing, of any of the multiple parties who are involved in this. [narrator] But the moral high ground wasn't the only thing that appealed to Avrum and Kristen. Like small farmers everywhere, they were strapped for cash. Even in small organic farming, you have to have money to make money! If we had been able to really invest in our farm up-front, we could grow a lot faster. -We could make a living. -But just barely. [Stanley] For a cold winter day, it's not too bad. It looks like, maybe, 250... 275. [narrator] And according to them, there was, in Stanley's pitch, an implicit promise of a cash windfall. In March of that year, he told us he had received $50,000 for his participation, and he had received a promise of some garlic harvesting equipment, the very stuff that we really needed to boost our production. -Are you guys ready to load it? -Oh, yeah. Oh, damn. [narrator] Their hope was that Ted's Chinese clients would be so grateful to finally have an even playing field, they might offer the New Mexico farmers a big payout when all was said and done. [Ted] I think we said on several occasions that if there would be some payout at the end, that they would benefit, that we would share whatever came, along with whatever Stan would get. -Getting cold again. -Right. [Kristen] We felt like Stan understood the situation enough that we trusted him, and that we were doing something good in the world, and we were going to get some money for the infrastructure for our farm. So, it was through those conversations that we decided to join. [narrator] In November of 2015, Ted's office filed the official request that the Department of Commerce review Harmoni's practices. All that was left to do was wait. [Stanley] "See garlic as a pretext for waiting. It has no other way but the long wash of time to extract the sulfur compounds from the soil and to distill them into its distinctive potion. All garlic questions ultimately may have to do with the passage of time, and therefore with mortality, and therefore with vampires, whatever they may be." [interviewer] So what was Harmoni's response to the DOC review request? Well, it was extreme. It's unprecedented. I remember that night, there was two feet of new snow on the ground, when that lawsuit landed in our driveway. [Stanley] We were served on a Sunday with a 75-page summons. And I read through this and thought, "This is crazy." [narrator] Harmoni had launched its counter-attack. It was a RICO lawsuit, as in, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations. [Kristen] It was scary. It was really scary. I mean, here we are, we make this much income, and we're these little farmers living in this little town, and suddenly, we're being accused of racketeering. We were blown away. We thought, "What did we get into?" A RICO statute brings to mind the Mafia, you know, something that's an illegal process. Having practiced trade law for 40 years, I have never seen a dumping case that was parallel with a RICO case filed in federal court. [narrator] Harmoni claimed that 14 individuals and eight corporations were all conspiring together to bring Harmoni down. Crawford, Katz, and Hume were on the list. But so was one person that the New Mexico farmers had never heard of: Mingju Xu. And it turned out he had his own story to tell about Harmoni and Christopher Ranch. [Mingju] My name is Mingju Xu. I'm a garlic importer, processor and wholesaler. My hometown is Jinxiang County in Shandong Province, China. Garlic growing everywhere, and many people depend on garlic for their living. For the garlic industry, the number one product is peeled garlic. Not fresh garlic. Not the garlic bulbs. We tried to set up a facility to peel the garlic in America. You know, we can buy the garlic from every corner of the world. And peel it here, so we can keep it fresh. You see, very nice garlic. We work seven days a week. At least 12 hours per day. Our product is good. We should make pretty good money. But actually, not. The reason is the cost. We cannot compete with the Chinese peeled garlic. [narrator] In 2015, Ming's friends in China explained why the Chinese peeled garlic was so much cheaper than what he could offer. The reason is some guy uses prisoners to peel the garlic. I have talked with some law professors in China. They told me it's illegal in China to export the prison peeled garlic. [narrator] In the US, it's perfectly legal to produce goods using American prison labor. But as of 2016, it's illegal to import anything made with forced prison labor abroad. [Mingju] But the garlic, it's exported to America! It's amazing. It's unbelievable. When I heard that story, we just wanted to make sure. [narrator] On his next trip to China, Mingju did just that. [suspenseful music] [Mingju Xu] I go to a special store. Bought a camera. And I went to the jail to take a look of it. If the officer found that camera, definitely I would have huge trouble. [narrator] Posing as a garlic buyer, he found a truck driver willing to take him into a prison and walk him through the prison garlic supply chain. From the monitor, we can see those people sitting on the big bed. And they sit on the bed and they peel the garlic. They peel around 14, 15, 16 hours. [narrator] To Mingju's eyes, peeling garlic was clearly not a choice. This was forced labor. [Mingju] All the prisoners must finish the peeling of 20 kilos of garlic. If you cannot finish the job, one choice is working longer time. But you must finish it. It's a very tough job, to peel so much. I have seen a guy put the garlic to his mouth. I asked the officer, "Why is that guy eating the garlic?" The officer told me he didn't eat the garlic. When they peel the garlic, they put the garlic in water. And so when they use their nail to cut the root, their nails get soft, so easy to wear out. After peeling the garlic for such a long time, he lost his nails. So he used his teeth to cut off the garlic roots, the garlic roots, like this. [muffled voices in Mandarin] We see lots of guys use their teeth to cut off the root. When we talked with local garlic guys, they said there are many jails do the same thing. The jails in Shandong province, Hunan, and Jiangsu, all the neighboring area. Almost all this stuff goes to America. Only America wants freshly peeled garlic. [narrator] In fact, around 60% of all the Chinese garlic Americans consume is pre-peeled. Before it gets shipped to the US it has to be packed at a processing house. And that's where Mingju's guide took him next. [Mingju] Outside, they store some of their boxes. We all saw the boxes they use. In the corner of the box, there was printed the words "HOI." Harmoni Organic International. [narrator] Harmoni wasn't the only company whose name appeared to be on the boxes. [Mingju] We see the trademark. The golden lion. We knew the golden lion is a trademark of Christopher Ranch. It's amazing. [narrator] Mingju was convinced that Christopher Ranch, the biggest garlic company in America, had been selling prison-peeled garlic to American consumers for years. [Mingju] In Jinxiang, this is a public story. Everyone knows the prisoners peel the garlic. [voices talking in Mandarin] [interviewer] Is that garlic peeled by hand? [in Mandarin] Usually people in prison peel them. [in Mandarin] This garlic is peeled at prisons in Jinxiang. [narrator] If Mingju is right, that's how these cloves have been making their way into American restaurants, food products, and grocery stores. We cannot compete with Christopher. We could not compete with the Harmoni guy. So we lost all the business. [narrator] After Mingju returned home to the US, his lawyer sent a letter to Harmoni demanding nearly $32 million in lost profits. Mingju also alerted US Customs and Border Patrol to what he had seen in prison. If Customs found Mingju's evidence credible, they could shut down all imports of Harmoni garlic immediately. Suddenly, Harmoni was under attack on multiple fronts. To defend themselves, they filed the RICO lawsuit, declaring that all of the defendants were conspiring against them. Four American guys, New Mexico farmers and Mr. Hume, a lawyer, we had never seen them, never met them. Never talked to them on the phone. I don't know why he put all of us together. I felt very angry, and frustrated. I thought all this was nonsense. They are trying to use all their forces to defend themselves, to avoid being reviewed. That's the only excuse. I'll just start the pasta. I have to get it boiling. -Go ahead. The tomatoes are really good. -Yeah, they are. -[Avrum] You need some garlic? -[Kristen] Yes, I do need garlic. [narrator] Over the next few months, as everyone waited for the RICO case to make its way through the courts, Avrum and Kristen were getting nervous. We went online and we started doing a lot of research about Ted, and Ted's clients, and Harmoni, and we learned a lot of things that made us really uncomfortable. [narrator] Ted's clients weren't just any companies. Avrum and Kristen realized they also happened to be Harmoni's direct competitors. [Kristen] We knew that Ted had been representing some Chinese companies for a number of years, and we definitely were aware that... what we were doing would be of benefit to them also. [narrator] According to Harmoni's RICO case, it was Ted's Chinese clients who were doing the dumping. Harmoni claimed that one of them, a shadowy garlic businessman from Qingdao, had orchestrated everything from the beginning. That he had funded the payment to Stanley as part of a $1.6 million war chest set up to destroy Harmoni. [Avrum] It made us realize, "Wow, who are these people Ted is working for? What is going on?" [narrator] The Qingdao businessman was Jack Bai. [in Mandarin] My name is Jack Bai. I import and export agricultural products. [speaking in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] Harmoni sued me in court, for using $1.6 million to bribe the New Mexico farmers. I am saying seriously here that I never paid this money. I never did this thing. [narrator] A few years ago, Bai's company sold a steady stream of garlic to the US. But ever since Harmoni took over the market, Bai says companies like his simply couldn't compete. [in Mandarin] My tax rate was much too high. There was no profit for me. So I quit the business. Other companies are afraid of Harmoni. They are afraid of its power, or the huge alliance of its processing plants. They are afraid of it very much. [narrator] The great irony of it all, to Jack Bai, is the role of the Fresh Garlic Producers Association. [Jack, in Mandarin] In fact, it was FGPA who initiated the anti-dumping duty on garlic in the first place. In the meantime, FGPA is the biggest seller of Chinese garlic. Our real competitor is not Harmoni. It is FGPA who is behind all of this and controls everything. [narrator] As for the charge that he paid off Stanley Crawford and Avrum Katz, Bai flatly denies it. [in Mandarin] One of the farmers' names is Stan. And I had dinner with him once. That was all. We never contacted each other afterwards. So I never did the "support" you were talking about. Nobody of our company, nobody of our clients paid anything to the New Mexico people to support them to file anything against Harmoni. No. Absolutely no. That's bullshit. [interviewer] Did you pay Stanley or Avrum to join the case? No, and I think we made it very clear that this was a case, you know, that we were getting involved with that, from my perspective, was really to deal with the gaming part of the system. And I think that was made clear to Stan. I had thought it was made clear to Avrum as well. Keane, you could cut some of these along here. Why don't you just cut these? [narrator] But to Avrum and Kristen, something about Harmoni's allegations rang true. They say it was always a pay-to-play scenario. [Kristen] When we got involved we thought, "Oh, we'll sign on for this administrative review, and then, boom, we'll get a check for $50,000." -Like Stan did. -Like Stan did. And it didn't work out that way, obviously. [Avrum] We have a weed whacker. This stuff is for the goats. Kristen's goats need... Goats love stuff like that, believe it or not. Early on I kept saying, "OK, so we're going to get paid. Can we put it in writing, can we make it legal?" [narrator] Meanwhile, they say the promised windfall only got bigger. [Kristen] In October of that same year, Ted Hume had begun talking to us about all the money that Jack Bai and Wang Ruopeng were going to send to us soon. The number kept getting bigger. We were going to get $2 million-- -2.7. -$2.7 million. "They have all the money..." He would say, "They have so much money. Don't worry. They want to invest in American farms and farmers." [Stanley] Avrum and Kristen were expecting some kind of payoff. That was not an unreasonable expectation, but there was no promise ever made that they would be paid. What happened is that their expectations, in a sense, got the best of them. [narrator] By June of 2016, Avrum and Kristen were feeling desperate. [Ted] They were expressing great concern about, they had hardships and financial issues. And my wife and I, you know, accepted this, and understood that, you know, farmers have problems and it was not unique, so we gave them a $5,000 check. It was a gift. That was very, very... that was great. So we said, "We'll stick with it for a while." [narrator] That payment to Avrum, and the original $50,000 check to Stanley would come back to haunt them. [Stanley] "Numbers are forgotten. The financial statement must finally give way to the narrative. With all its exceptions, special cases, imponderables, it must finally give way to the story, which is perhaps the way we arm ourselves against the next, and always unpredictable, turn of the cycle, in the quixotic dare that is life." [interviewer] What are we going to get? To get the green garlic. Uh, you know, with some sunshine, it will be green. Without any sunshine, it will be yellow. [narrator] By September of 2016, Harmoni was on the defensive. Thanks to the letter that Mingju and his attorney sent to US Customs, one after another, Harmoni's garlic shipments were being detained at US ports over concerns about forced prison labor. We believe the use of prisoners is immoral. So, we just told the story. And let society know. To stop the prison labor is good. Protect the American market. So good for American garlic growers. For American people. It's also good for Chinese society. [narrator] And there was even more bad news for Harmoni. The Federal District Court dismissed the RICO suit. Harmoni was forced to pay a portion of Mingju's attorney's fees. The judge threw away their case, so we win. And Harmoni paid us $36,000. [narrator] To Mingju, it felt like the beginning of the end for Harmoni and their customer, Christopher Ranch. This is an automatic garlic planter, and it's fast. [narrator] Later that year, Avrum and Kristen heard about some disquieting new developments on Stanley's farm. [Kristen] Some new equipment appeared at Stan Crawford's farm in the summer of 2016, which as we mentioned, we really, really could use some garlic harvesting equipment. [narrator] Some of the equipment was paid for by Stanley, and some of it came as a gift from friends in China. This is a garlic separator that Ruopeng sent us. The garlic bulbs get dropped in here and are broken apart into cloves so we can plant. This is a peeler, but we're not certain how it works. This was where we started to feel like we were being done wrong, in that when Avrum and Stanley had talked about it, there was an agreement that everything would be shared. And if there were some things coming from China, they weren't being shared. We felt very betrayed by what happened. [narrator] So, Avrum and Kristen made one last effort to collect the money they felt they had been promised. [Ted] They said by the end of the year they needed $25,000. My wife and I said that that was going to be difficult, and we did give them, you know, a check for $10,000. And they said we would get the other $15,000 as a loan on December 15th. December 15th came around and all of a sudden, "No, we can't afford it. We can't do that. This is just... We can't possibly do that." [narrator] To Avrum and Kristen, things were suddenly perfectly clear. This had never been about helping them. It was always about Ted's Chinese clients, the direct competitors to Harmoni. [Kristen] They were really the only ones who were going to benefit. We were not trying to level the playing field for domestic garlic growers. We were trying to level the playing field for Ted's clients. We weren't trying to level the field, but trying to level their competitors. [narrator] Feeling caught in the crossfire between Harmoni and Ted's Chinese clients, Avrum and Kristen pulled out of Ted's coalition altogether. [Kristen] We believed that we were sort of pawns, being used by these two giant corporations, who are jockeying for position, and they are fighting over their piece of the American market, of the American pie. And we had been used in that battle and that's sort of how we saw it. [narrator] That's when they got a phone call. And on the other end of the line... was someone from Harmoni. Over the phone, Harmoni made their case, that in fact, they were the victims all along, that Ted Hume, and Ruopeng, and Jack Bai, and Ted's other clients in China, were the true villains, out to destroy Harmoni for their own gain. [Kristen]  For me, that was when I understood we had done something wrong that we needed to correct. We needed to do something about it. [narrator] So Avrum and Kristen sent a scathing letter to the Department of Commerce, laying out all the sordid details of the pay-for-play scheme as they saw it. [soft piano and violin playing] [narrator] Avrum and Kristen had switched sides. [Ted] I was very surprised that he would submit such a letter. You know, I was disappointed. [Ted] You can come up here, especially at night, and see the stars. It's a really pretty spectacular place to just sit. [Stanley] Avrum was accusing Ted and I of engineering a fraudulent scheme, and deceiving him into believing that he was participating in this worthy cause and that he would be royally compensated. Nobody promised anything to anybody about making money in the future if you're doing this and that. This is not... this is not the truth. [narrator] According to Stanley and Ted, it was Avrum and Kristen who had been corrupted by cash. [interviewer] Do you think that they were, in essence, paid off by Harmoni to remove themselves from... I do. We don't know the rate of compensation, but I assume it's handsome. I don't know quite how to describe our relationship with Harmoni. We are not working for Harmoni. We view what we are doing as working for ourselves. The money is on public record, though, so just tell them how that happened. We wanted to go to the Department of Commerce and set the record straight. We didn't know how. We didn't have the resources, really, to spend any time on this. When Harmoni came to us and talked to us, they said, "We cannot pay you for your testimony. We can pay you an hourly rate for the actual hours you spend reviewing documents, and doing the work necessary that you want and need to do. We know from the record that was filed that Harmoni's lawyers have admitted that they paid both Avrum and his wife. I don't know... They have not stated what the details were, but they admitted on the public record that they were being paid. What they have done is shocking. They have allied themselves with the largest importer of garlic that is paying virtually nothing for the garlic and selling it at a very low price, which is not to my benefit, certainly, and to theirs, even, or other garlic producers. So why they would do this other than the money... and even the money, to me... Is it worth it? [soft guitar music] [interviewer] Are anybody's hands clean in this whole thing? -[Avrum] No. -[Kristen] Nobody's hands are clean. Our hands are not clean. Stan Crawford's hands are not clean. Ted Hume's hands are not clean. Harmoni's hands are not clean. [narrator] Finally, in June 2017, the Department of Commerce announced its final ruling. And they ruled in favor of Harmoni. In my reading of this decision, they accepted virtually every argument that Harmoni made and no arguments that we made. It was clearly a one-sided, very biased decision. [narrator] The Department found that payments to Stanley and Avrum could in fact be linked to Jack Bai, that Ted's Chinese clients were the ones guilty of dumping, and that Ted's team had no credibility. And even if there were wrongdoing by Harmoni and Christopher Ranch, Commerce said that wasn't their department. "The Department does not have the authority to enforce the criminal laws of the United States. Thus, we can offer no opinion on this." [narrator] Ted Hume, Ruopeng Wang and Stanley Crawford had lost their bid to even the playing field. Hume is appealing that decision. A federal judge ruled that Mingju's video tapes were not sufficient evidence to block the import of the garlic, that, he had argued, was peeled by prisoners. The shipments continue. Mingju Xu may never be able to return to China because of the work he did exposing prison-peeled garlic. I believe I have done nothing wrong. What I have done is good for everyone. But if I had another choice, if life kind of repeated, probably I would think it over. Maybe I would not try it again. [narrator] Harmoni asserts that Mingju's allegations about prison-peeled garlic are false, and they insist that their garlic is sourced from factories that comply with China's labor and safety laws. They also deny that they colluded with Christopher Ranch to "game the system." Christopher Ranch declined to answer any questions for this documentary. The Fresh Garlic Producers Association did not answer a request for information on its trade relationship with Harmoni. [Ted]  I think that there is a very real need, that if you're going to have statutes like the dumping law, the purpose of which is to protect American jobs, that we eliminate these possibilities of gaming, which benefit the few at the expense of the many. And, you know, garlic growers here in New Mexico are a good example. [Kristen] I think that it's really unfortunate in the way this played out, because I believe that Stanley Crawford believes in his cause, and I know that we believe in our cause. And I think... I hope that we can all get beyond this at some point. [Kristen] Ultimately, all of us are working for the same thing. It's really for the small growers. It's really about the small farmers in the United States and in China, and it's not really about these businessmen who are making all the money off of our backs. [speaking in Mandarin] [soft piano music] [Stanley] "I feel the days ahead stirring in my body. They are connected, these fields, these high, sunny days, and warm nights. And this creature that plies them endlessly through the days. I'm awake again. It all makes sense again. I know I can go on."
