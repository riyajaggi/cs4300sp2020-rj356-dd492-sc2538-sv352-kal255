[ROB] Three... two... one. [WATER SPLASHES] [MIA] Um, it's an honor to be speaking here today amongst such impressive company. Uh, I'm thrilled to have been shared... I'm thrilled to have been asked to share my vision of the future, such as it is. Looking around at a world of injustice, intolerance and huge environmental challenges, it's hard to imagine a bright future, but we can and we must. It's the only way that we can build a better tomorrow. [MIA] Um...  So I'll start with a funny story. [COMPUTER MOUSE CLICKS] [KEYS JANGLING] - [SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] - [MIA] Right. I'm off. Bye-bye. [KISSES] [MAN WHISTLING] - See you later on. - [MIA] See you tomorrow. OK. - [MIA] Have a nice day. - You too. - Bye, Mom! - There we go. [PHONE BLEEPS] [CAR BLINKER TICKING] [DOG BARKING] - [CHAIN RATTLES] - Hiya, puppy. [BARKING CONTINUES] One moment. - Coming! - [SNIFFS] Just a second! - Mrs. Carmichael? - Yes? I'm here on behalf of Realm Insurance. Just need to log your recollections about the accident. - Am I all right to come in? - Uh, OK then. [DOOR CLOSES] [MAN] Someone who has risen to become one of the most innovative architects of her generation. Not just an architect of buildings, but communities. But enough of me telling you about her. Please welcome Mia Nolan. [APPLAUSE] Thank you, Martin. Thanks. It's an honor to be speaking here amongst such impressive company. [PIZZA VAN BEEPS] [AUTOMATED VOICE] Good evening, welcome to Fences Pizza. Your pizza is ready for collection. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [MIA] Hello? - [ROB] It's me. - Hey. Hey. - Did your chin catch Dutch fur disease? - [ROB] Yeah, fuck you. [LAUGHS] I didn't say I didn't like it. Come in. What's it been? It's been like two years now, hasn't it? Uh, three. Dropping in on my hotel room, it must be important. - Shall we find somewhere to eat? - Yeah, well, I... I got in touch 'cause I saw that you were in town for what is it, some, some architecture thing? It's a forum, they call it. People actually pay to come and listen to me talk. [SCOFFS] Imagine that. Almost does my head in. [LAUGHS] And you're looking good. Is that the gym? Well, you look... I look like dog shit, Mia. I'll save you the bother. Dried-up dog shit. - [MIA] Do you want a drink? - I knocked it on the head. What, you quit, like fully quit? [ROB] Nine months, three weeks, two days. Well done. Well, that's great. You go ahead. - Really, go on. - You sure? - Absolutely. - OK. [MIA] You picked a terrible place to come see me 'cause it reeks of hops all the way down the street outside here. - Did you notice that? - [ROB] No. - [MIA] It's like a full-on beer smell. - [BOTTLE OPENING, FIZZING] Can't help your sobriety, that. But I probably shouldn't be talking about booze, should I? [SIGHS] Rob, I hope you're not here to talk about what I... It's about that, yeah. I've been thinking about it again, that night. - [MIA] Rob. - I can't not think about it. We said that we'd put it out of our minds. Weren't we just gonna try and keep it out? [ROB] I can't. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. Well, in here, it's now. Yeah, I know. Why today? Why is it preying on your mind today? - [ROB] There's a news story. - A news story? [PAPER RUSTLES] Uh, a featured article. Well, whatever you call it. [STAMMERS] I printed it for you. Mia? That... That's her. It's his wife. - You don't know that's his wife. - There is a photo of him at the bottom. It's him. And the poor cunt, they never found him. So she never remarried. She never fucking moved house. She stayed where she is in case he came back. All this time, Mia, she's still waiting for him. That's dreadful. But what can we do? I'm gonna write her a letter. - No. - Anonymous. - I am not gonna mention you. - Rob, no. You'll open up God knows what, you'll just rake it all up. - [STAMMERS] I can't live with it, Mia. - There's things they can do. 'Cause they can trace it back. They can trace it. They'll find the body, they'll find us. - They won't find us. - Yes, they will, then we're fucked. Look, when I quit alcohol, they told me to make amends with anyone I've ever hurt. Who have I hurt more than her? Also say you're not supposed to hurt anyone else. What about me? - What about her? - No, no, no. No. No! Fuck! [EXHALES, WHIMPERS] It was your idea. It was your fucking idea! - [ROB] I know. I know, and I'm sorry. - [SOBS] Fifteen years, 15 years, the fucking shame, the fucking guilt! I've got somewhere. I've got a life. You don't know, don't understand. [ROB] That's not the point, though. - You don't understand. - [SCOFFS] You're not married. I've got a son. He's nine years old. You've seen photos of him. Think of him, please. I'm sorry. [ROB SIGHS] I sat on this for you. - I fucking sat on this for you! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, look at me. [SNIFFLES] [SIGHS] Look at me. I've made up my mind, and that's how it is. Please, please, please. Please, please, please, Rob. Hey, listen, I understand. I understand. Do you? Yeah. Come on, let's talk about this. No, no, I can't stay here. - [MIA] No, no, no, no. - What are you doing? Let go! Mia, I'm fucking leaving. [ROB] What are you doing? Mia, let the... Mia, let the fuck... Let the fuck... go! - [CRASHING] - [ROB] Fuck... - [MIA SOBS] - Ah! [HEAD CRACKS] [MIA GASPS] [ROB GROANS] - [MIA GRUNTS] - [CHOKING] [CHOKING CONTINUES] - [MIA STRAINS] - [GROANS] [MIA GASPING] [CHOKING STOPS] [BREATH QUAVERING] [MIA PANTING] [EXHALES] ["ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT LOVE IS" PLAYING] [PIZZA VAN WHIRS] [WHIRRING, CRASHING] [MAN SCREAMS IN PAIN] [PIZZA VAN ALARM BLEEPS] [MAN GROANS] - [WOMAN] Huh? - [EXHALES] [MAN] Codger. That's his name, Codger. [LAUGHS] - What? - [GUINEA PIG SQUEAKS] - Ah, you don't like him. - Oh, it's not that. - It's so hard to get presents for you. - No, I like him. He's... fluffy. [LAUGHS] Exactly. No, Ali's gonna love him. It's just we've got a lot going on, what with Ali and... I'll take him back. The pet shop guy was OK. It won't be a problem. No, no, no, no, you're right. It'll be good for Ali. Codger stays. - He's... Codger the lodger. - [LAUGHS] [BABY CRYING] Changing time. Uh... - Happy birthday. - Thanks. - [BABY CONTINUES CRYING] - [LAUGHS] [SQUEAKS] [CLICKS, BLEEPING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - [MAN] Room service. [CLEARS THROAT] - [CARD BLEEPING] - [MAN] Lovely, thank you. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SEXUAL MOANING] - [MIA GRUNTS] - [MOANING CONTINUES] [SEXUAL MOANING IN BACKGROUND] [EXHALES] [CART RATTLES] [PHONE VIBRATING] [VIBRATION CONTINUES] Hi. Hiya, love. Yeah, it was... No, the speech went great. Yeah, I'm back in the morning. I'm just tired, that's all. Um... Did he? Oh, that's great. No, don't put him on. [SIGHS] Hi, hey. Hey, Dad said you were great in your rehearsal for your play. You had a good rehearsal? Yeah, I'm proud of you. Yeah. I love you. - [CLANGING] - [CHATTERING] [CHAINS JANGLE] [EXHALING, GRUNTING] [SIZZLING] [BODY CRASHING, SIZZLING] [TYPING] So that's one night. You had room service and a ã9.99 charge for the movie. For a movie? You... you watched a film last night, no? Yeah. I was in last night, yeah. [CARD READER BLEEPS] Thanks. - Thank you. - [ELEVATOR DINGS] [ALARM BLARES IN DISTANCE] [KNOCKING] I'm from Realm Insurance, about the pizza van accident. [MAN] Oh, come in. [WOMAN] I mean, it'll cover you for up to four months, but that is quite a substantial claim. Well, I was heading off on tour with the Philharmonic next week. Europe, Middle East, Australia. - Not now. - Mm. As I'm sure you appreciate, with a payout of this size, - we will need to investigate the accident. - Yeah, of course. Now, that stretch of the street has a security camera, vandalized, by some kids, I'm guessing, paintballed right in the wrong place. But the, um... delivery van thing must've had a camera. - Not working. - Oh, for God's sake. No, that's actually good for your claim. Fences Pizza's a big company. They've been claiming their driverless fleet has a good record. [MAN SCOFFS] The malfunctioning camera, that's a step toward negligence. So if we can prove full liability, you could also consider filing a substantial civil case under our litigation wing? Could be a lot of money. Yeah, OK, I'm sold. Great. [CHUCKLES] Now, I'll just hook you up - to the recaller here. - [WHIRRING] - [MAN] It's one of those memory dredgers? - [BLEEPS] [WOMAN LAUGHS] We prefer "corroborators." - [MAN] Police things, aren't they? - Mm... Not since last year. We all have them now. Right. - May I? - Yeah. - [MAN] I feel like a specimen. - [LAUGHS] [SUCTIONS, BLEEPS] [WOMAN] So, this accesses engrams, your memories of what happened. Now, they're subjective. They may not be totally accurate, and they're often emotional, but by collecting a range of recollections from yourself and any witnesses, we can help build a corroborative picture of the whole. [MAN] I don't remember anything. It's a total blank. Oh, I've got something that might help. [MAN] What, getting drunk? The accident happened a few hundred meters from the Castle Port Brewery. [BOTTLE FIZZES] The whole area smells like a pub. No sipping, just take a sniff. Aroma's a great memory boost, helps anchor you - to where you were. - [SNIFFS] Oh... that's familiar. OK. Now, hold that smell in your mind, close your eyes and picture the street. [MAN EXHALES] [BLEEPING, WHIRRING] [WOMAN] Getting something now. - Yeah. I went to a sort of comic shop... - [STATIC WHIRRING] [MAN] Culty stuff. Um... I think it started snowing when I came out. Heavy snow, um... There was music from a car. - [BLEEPING] - ["ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT LOVE IS" PLAYING] I like that song. [MAN] There was a woman in a yellow coat coming towards me. [WOMAN] Good recall on her face. She had this weird lipstick on. It stood out. And she's pretty. - [MUSIC CONTINUES] - Um, yeah, yeah, and that, too. Well, the more emotional your response, the more vivid your memory of it is. So there was the music and a girl, and then what happened? [MAN] Well, I went to cross the road, wasn't really thinking about anything, - and, uh... - [CAR SCREECHING] And that's just when it just goes. Um... That's OK. What you've given me is already useful. - [MAN] Really? - [VIDEO REWINDS] [WOMAN] Well, I've got someone to look for, Little Miss Yellow Coat. - Hey. - [MAN] Ah, the wanderer returns. - Yeah. - You don't know how to fix this, do you? Um, yeah, I'll have a look at it later. - [BOY] Hi, Mom. - [MIA] Hi, you. [VIDEO GAME BEEPING] Tonight's the big night. ♪ We coulda been anything ♪ ♪ That we wanted to be ♪ [BOY] Dad! - School musical, Bugsy Malone. - [CLEARS THROAT] You all right? Yeah. Yeah. They've got this, um, sound system for the backing tracks that they can't work out and I said I'd help them out. So... I'm gonna be there all day. You're gonna die of loneliness here, are you? [MIA] Yeah, I'll be fine. [MAN] Well, we'll see you later, 7:30. - [MIA] Mm-hmm. - Don't forget. I won't. - [MAN] See ya. - [BOY] See you later. [MIA] Bye. [DISTANT SIRENS] [PHONE BLEEPS] [PHONE CLUNKS] [ENGINE MOANING] [ENGINE FIRES UP, BEEPING] [CANDY BAG RUSTLES] [WOMAN] It was only yesterday. You're efficient. The fresher the memory, the stronger it is, and the stronger the memory, the stronger the case. I'll also just get you to take a sniff of this. - [BOTTLE FIZZES] - [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] God knows what they think we're doing in here. [LAUGHS] If you close your eyes, I'm also gonna play a piece of music. ["ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT LOVE IS" PLAYING] God, yeah, yeah, that, that was on. How weird. Hold those things in your mind and picture what you saw. - [MUSIC CONTINUES] - [SNIFFING] I was on Stanhope Road, near the hotel place, looking at flats and stuff, you know, window shopping. I saw this guy walking towards me. I remember thinking he looked sort of sweet. The music was coming from the car, which pulled off. Actually that was when the delivery thing drove past. [STATIC BUZZING] Fences Pizza? What sort of speed was it going? You mean, was it going too fast? Um... - Try and focus on the vehicle. - Maybe. - [WOMAN] Um... - [BLEEPING] [SIGHS] Um... I don't know. I couldn't really say. What about the impact itself? Well, I didn't really see it. I just saw the aftermath, really. [CRASHING, MAN SCREAMING] - [VIDEO BLEEPS] - [CONTROLLER CLICKS] [SCREAMING REPLAYS] [VIDEO BLEEPS] A moment earlier you saw a bright light? Yeah. Like a camera flash just before. Just outside the dentist place. - [RECALLER BEEPS] - Hmm. [SCRUBBING] [DOORBELL BUZZES] [WOMAN] And I'm assuming your window glazing's soundproof. - [DENTIST] Yes, we get the odd screamer. - I won't bother with the music then. Look, to be honest, the memory's a bit embarrassing... - Don't worry, I've seen it all. - Do you have to use that thing? Look, your memories will be sealed and private. Unless they indicate you're harming yourself or another person. Go on then. [SUCTIONS, BLEEPING] [SIGHS] [RECALLER BLEEPING] [CRUNCHES ON CANDY] [STATIC BLEEP] [DENTIST] I'd had a patient. Hmm, so I see. [DENTIST] She left around six, I think. I stayed to clear up. You saw something from the window? [DENTIST SIGHS] There was a guy in the hotel window. Well, what can I say? [DENTIST] He was picturesque. [CONTROLLER CLICKING] [WOMAN] Did you take a photo? - [CANDY CRUNCHING] - [DENTIST] Well, I tried to. I left the flash on by mistake, so all I got was the reflection. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - [WOMAN] And then? - I was going to take another one. I saw some woman staring at something. So I looked down, it was just a load of commotion. [DENTIST] There was a woman in a sort of lime coat. [CRUNCHING] Hmm, yellow actually. - [DENTIST] Well, I knew it was vivid. - Well, memories can be subjective. What we do is build up an overall average, a crowd-sourced picture of reality. [RECALLER BLEEPS] Did you see the vehicle that hit the pedestrian? Any sense of its speed? I didn't see the actual crash, sorry. [BEEPING, WHIRRING] OK. [EXHALES] - You won't tell anyone about the photo? - [RECALLER BLEEPS] Don't need to put that in my report. It's safe with me. [HOTEL CLERK] That'd be room 304. Can you tell me who stayed there? - You're not the police? - No, but... Then you'd have to lodge for an information request for that. But that could take up to a week to process. Sorry, management's an ass about it ever since that thing with what's-his-name, the judge of Hot Shots? Anyway, he got caught with a rent boy and, um, a tabloid got his name by hacking our booking system, and yeah, they're tight as anything about the rule now. Oh, the woman I'm after hasn't done anything. I just think she might have seen something outside yesterday evening about 6:30. Oh, I can... I can tell you that she wasn't outside... and I know what she was looking at. [GENTLE SCOFF] How so? I can't tell you who she is but, um, she's into interesting films. We log the in-house movies that people watch and, um... her choice stood out. Oh. [LAUGHS] - How nice for her. Thanks. - [LAUGHS] [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING OUTSIDE] [COMPUTER BLEEPS] Oh, bless you. [MAN] How's the pizza accident going? [WOMAN] Hmm. A pain in the ass. Can't pinpoint liability 'cause no one agrees on the speed of the bloody thing and I can't find anyone who actually saw the impact. Well, not yet. [SIGHS] Except maybe smudge face here, whoever she is. - [COMPUTER BLEEPS] - [WOMAN] Oh, bingo. Mia Nolan. You might be the one, if you'll talk. What, if she'll talk? She was doing something embarrassing in the hotel room, watching a porn film. She might not want me poking around in her head. [MAN CHUCKLES] She's, like, 50 miles out of town. Do you mind if I head there now? It's a bit late. Oh, if I sew this up in 24 hours, I get two times bonus. Well... Go. Go.

I'm from Realm Insurance. - I've already got insurance, thanks. - [SHAZIA] I'm not selling anything. I'm following up on an incident you might've seen, a road accident. I don't know anything about an accident. [SHAZIA] This was only yesterday. - [MIA] An accident? - On Stanhope Road. Medina Plaza Hotel, a pedestrian was hit by a delivery vehicle, Fences Pizza, driverless. Um... [LAUGHS] Right, yeah. I'm sorry, actually I did. When you first mentioned it, I just didn't think of it, but um... yeah, I did. So you saw what happened? [MIA] Uh, yeah, there was a guy crossing the street and this little van thing sort of just clipped him, it was quick. [SHAZIA] Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about it? It won't take long. I'm sorry, I'm really busy. I've got... [SHAZIA] I don't wanna sound heavy but it's a legal requirement since last year. It's a legal requirement? Well, if you've witnessed an incident, yes. I have to notify the police when people refuse, and when they get involved, it just drags everything out, so... [MIA CLEARS THROAT] - Come in. - [SIGHS] Thank you. Yeah, just that way. [RECALLER FIRING UP] [BEEPING] [SHAZIA] OK. - What does that do? - [SHAZIA] The recaller? Just helps me get a record of what happened. May I? Well, I can just tell you what happened. I can remember. The van hit the guy, and he fell over, and then people came to help. [SHAZIA] How fast was it going though, the delivery vehicle? Um... [SHAZIA] See, I just need a sense of that. It's sometimes hard to articulate what your mind's eye's seen, but capturing your impression of what you saw is really useful. - OK, but I've got... - And that's all I'm interested in. You can read the terms here if you like. All the legal stuff is in there. Look, I don't care what you might've been doing in the hotel room in your own time. I'm not gonna ask you anything about that. Won't go there. - OK. - [SHAZIA] Private stuff is private stuff. - So it's just the accident? - Just that. [MIA] It's a bit of a long read, isn't it? [SHAZIA LAUGHS] - Do you want a tea or a coffee? - Oh, a coffee would be great. - Yeah, OK. Espresso? - Perfect. [COFFEE MACHINE WHIRS] Do you mind if I just go and have a pee if I'm gonna be sat down a while? - [SHAZIA] Yeah, sure. - OK. I ate hotel food, I had room service. I ate room service. I was in the hotel room on my own. Watched porn. Watched porn. Saw the accident. Come on, focus. [BREATHES HEAVILY] I was on my own. I was on my own. I was on my own. [SUCTIONS, BLEEPS] [BOTTLE FIZZES OPEN] There you go. Take a sniff. - What's that for? - It'll just help your recall. [BLEEPING] - [SETS DOWN BOTTLE] - That's it.

[MIA] Sorry about being short, it's been a long day. - No, it's fine. - Got a lot of work on. Did you... - So you've got everything you needed? - [SHAZIA] Yeah, yeah, got it all. - Don't worry, thank you so much. - I know this sounds silly, but, um, you know, sometimes I just think mad things, and it doesn't mean anything, do you know what I mean?

[SHAZIA SOBBING] No. If I take that off your mouth, will you promise not to scream? - Do you promise? - [WHIMPERS] Forget the report. I'll delete... [SNIFFS] I'll delete it, it won't go anywhere. I don't know. I tried to delete it, and I couldn't figure it out. I won't say anything to anyone, I promise. I'll forget the whole thing. [CRYING] No one will know. I won't say anything. I wish I believed you. I mean it. I mean it. I've seen things. I've seen things on the recaller. Secrets, personal things, I've never spilled any of it. I'm not allowed to, it's the law. It's like confession, it's like Catholic confession. It'll be illegal for me to say anything. Totally illegal, even if I wanted to! None of that's true, is it? - It is, I swear. - [MIA] It's not. It is. Did you tell anyone that you were coming here today? No. - You're lying. - I'm not. I swear I'm not lying. [SHAZIA SOBS] No, I swear. [MUFFLED] I swear. No! [GASPS, SCREAMING] No! No!
