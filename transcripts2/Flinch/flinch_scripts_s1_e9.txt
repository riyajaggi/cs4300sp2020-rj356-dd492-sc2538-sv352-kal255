 When St. Patrick blessed these ancient Irish hills, its silver streams, its friendly folk, ONE PLACE WAS OVERLOOKED: A remote farm. It is here, yet more brave souls want to test if they have what it takes. No way! Three unspeakable games... You have tested this out? With only one rule...

 What the...? Do... not... flinch! So flinching equals pain and humiliation. That is hot! Just don't do it. Competing in this episode, a tattoo cleaner. A fashion blogger. I don't normally do it like this. A smooth-talking recruiter. Bit of a ladies man, as well. An engineer who can't stop grinning. At least for now. A goat-loving shop manager.

 A fired-up beauty queen. A hairy beary social worker. And last but not least, a cosplayer with a thing for exotic animals. Absolutely adore pandas. AND HERE ARE YOUR HOSTS: Desiree, an American winner... Lloyd, an Englishman who hates losing... And Seann... Well, you decide. Let the games begin. Welcome to Flinch. You eight players are about to have your bravery pushed to the max, through a series of high-tension, adrenaline-fuelled challenges, designed specifically to make you flinch. The person who flinches the least across all three games will be crowned the winner. FLINCHES HAVE CONSEQUENCES: Pain for you and points for us. Stick with me. It's kind of complicated. Each of you are holding a spoon, and you're probably wondering why. You're going to put your spoon into that jug. We're each gonna pick one of you to represent us in the games. Every time you flinch we score a point. The one of us with the most points at the end has to face a horrible Flinch forfeit. Right, our fate is in your hands. I'm gonna go for... this person. Hello, my pal. Hi, I'm Zoe. I am actually Miss Manchester. Believe it or not. That was so cringe. And what is the biggest fear you've ever faced? Eating a tomato. - Did she just say "eating a tomato"? - Eating a tomato! Yeah. I'm happy with you. You're bizarre, - but I like you. - I'm bizarre! I've got... this man. Quite an unusual wave you've got there. - Hello. - Hello. What's your name? - I'm Ian. - What do you do, Ian? I study engineering. I'm Ian. I'm from Malaysia. I'm from the east side. So excited for this show, because I heard there's free food. Do you have any fears? Studying engineering. "Studying engineering"? - Okay. - He's facing his biggest fear. Okay, Ian, bye. Bye. - Hello. - That's me. Right, hello there. My name is Michael. I'm Mr. Confident, Mr. Spontaneous. Mr. Up-for-anything. Do you have any special talents? - Yeah, I do actually. - Yeah? Are you gonna tell me? Yeah, I will. Attracting ladies. Alright, this gonna be great. - Thank you so much. - No worries at all. Right guys, go on, off you go. Yep, you can do it. So it's off to the other side of the farm for these eight brave souls. WHAT AWAITS THEM CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS: Disturbing! - Let's see what it is. - Yeah. Splash. Oh, my God, what on Earth is this? - Zoe, my girl. - Yeah. Oh my God, I do not like this. In a skip. Classic night out in Manchester. She's probably used to it. That water doesn't look very inviting. - Are you gonna dunk me in that? - I think so. Yeah. Danger! Oh, highly explosive. That's not comforting. It looks like it's aimed right at her head. I reckon that barrel will fly towards them. If they flinch... Bash! Into the freezing skip. Face first? Might hit me, might not. Rocket science, mate. Zoe, are you ready? - No, no I'm not ready. - Brilliant. I'm not ready. Ready for what, exactly? It's fine. I've made my peace. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a flinch. He flinched well before there was danger. Yep, you're going down, cutie. What the... This is brutal. This is what we call advanced interrogation methods. That is the mother of all flinches. Thanks, Michael. No, don't freak out yet. Come on. I don't think at any point your guy is gonna get any braver. That's true, but he looks like he's loving it either way. Stinks! Okay Ian, just keep it cool and calm, mate. Oh, the suspense is killing. That is not cool or calm. He looks like a forty-year-old man going through a divorce. Actually, is he alright? No. No, he's not. Look, he's so scared. Come on Zoe, keep it together. - Flinch. - Great screamer. Look at the state of Zoe. It wasn't even enough to get her really wet. That is disgusting! So close! That's a flinch, kid. There you go. Take a nice little bath. No, no. He's got the hang of it now. - What, Laura? - Wow. Oh, my gosh. - Why couldn't we have got these people? - Yeah, see? Smashing it. Oh, no. You're gonna flinch. I mean, it really shifts, doesn't it? Oh, my God. I dunno what she thought she signed up for. - Oh, no. - Definitely flinching. That cute face straight in the skip. - Yeah. - That was refreshing. Bloke with tattoos, he seems relaxed. Oh, but still a flincher. He's like trying to channel something. What's he saying? He's terrible. He's trying to talk his way out. That is the most scared I've seen anyone. To be honest, I think that's his resting-flinch-face. Ah, that's a great... Oh! Oh! Do you have a best face award, though? 'Cause honestly, look at him. Honorable mention for that. Oh, yes. Look at him. - Oh, that line of drool. - Is that dribble? Yep. Well, that was the first game done. Should we have a look at the scores? Let's do it. Zoe is the worst flincher with six. - Horrible. - Followed by Ian, Michael and Lois. Dominique and Craig fair better. But it's James and Laura who win the game on three. So how does that affect the hosts? Zoe gives Lloyd six. Ian and Michael hand Desiree and Seann five each. So Lloyd's in line for the forfeit. - Alright. - I'll take that. That's fine. For now. - Shall we have another pick? - Yeah. Who's this? Hey, my name is Dominique. Is that alright? Hello. Uh oh. Dominique. Fear? "Fear"? I'm afraid of confined spaces. Small confined spaces. Anything else I should know about? - No, that's it. - That's it? Right, sounds great. Thank you, Dominique. Hello, sir. - Hello my friend. - Hello. Hi, my name is James, I've come here to test myself. Watch the chins, yeah? There ain't nothing here that's gonna phase me at all! Do you have any special talents you think are gonna help you in these challenges? I'm much older than these guys, so I've got life experience on my side, as well. You're grown, you have more to lose because you're highly more breakable, alright? We're good. Cheers, man. Thank you. I've got this young chap. Looks like he doesn't want to be here. Hi, my name's Craig. I'm a massive gamer. Good horror fan, so you can't scare me. What do you do for a living, Craig? I'm actually a cleaner, so not as exciting as these guys. You got any fears? Anything that scares you? - Anything that keeps you awake at night? - I don't like water. I don't like heights, and I don't like the dark. I'm a bit of a gamer, so you know nothing really scares me at the same time... Sorry, I'm gonna stop you there. You don't leave the house. Craig, thank you, mate. - Peace out. - Alright, get up there and don't flinch. Bring it on! What is this next game? Brass Band. Okay, there's my boy, Craig. And that is the walk of an unconfident man. - Smells a bit "farmy." - 'Cause you're on a farm, mate. - Your guy? - Yes. Oh, it's gonna be so bad, isn't it? This is Ian. And he's already flinching. Those jumper cables are never a good sign. Are they gonna conduct an electric current through them? What's happening? He's holding on to metal rods, which are attached to car batteries. So complete the circuit and hey presto, you get electric shock. Hang on, Lloyd, Desiree, is that a brass band? - Yeah. - Think he's gonna scream like a baby again. Does he know they're behind? No. He just thinks - he's meant to balance those things. - Amazing. Okay, Ian, are you ready? I'm ready. Ian is not ready. That is a flinch. Crashing cymbals behind the head, classic. Tell you what, that cymbal guy loves his job. Look at him. Flinch. That was a flinch. Ian's such a baby. Come on, Dominique. The face of dread. I was wrong, could never be more wrong. It's coming again. Oh, God... So she doesn't like music? I think she's got the fear of cymbals. Oh, leave it out. What are you doing? Okay, here's Michael. - Seems pretty cool. - But he always does, and then... That is a flinch. He got it anyway. - Yes, Craig! - What? Yes, Craig. Am I supposed to be electrocuted, right now? This is great. I'm gonna wee myself. Flinch. To be fair, she is being electrocuted. Yeah. We all saw that coming. Laura's dressed like Super Mario. It's the worst concert I've been to. Ow! Right, my guy, James. Will he trump Craig? Oh, no! Ah, come on. He's just electrocuted himself by making himself laugh. Yeah. Oh man. He's loving it. James. Finally. Terrified. Come on, Dominique. What are you doing? Nothing happened that time. She's doing the chicken limbo. Oh, thank... Stop. Seriously. Can I put these down? That was great. - I mean, for me that was amazing. - Yeah. - Against all odds. - Yeah. The man that hasn't left the house. Yeah, I feel like behind his eyeballs, he's playing a game right now. Like he's not even present. That's why he did that so well. I'm absolutely over the moon with that. Shall we look at the scores? Yeah. Dominique cymballed-out as the worst flincher with fourteen. The not knowing when it's gonna happen. I'm really flexible, apparently. Michael, Zoe and James also trumpeted out. Ian, Lois and Laura do better. But it's Craig that wins the game with eight. Every time I was calm. Trying to calm down. And this is the most surreal thing I've ever done. Let's see what that does to the loser board. Craig moves Lloyd to 14. James increases Desiree to 17. And Dominique pushes Sean to 19. So Seann goes into the last game in pole forfeit position. I am so happy. For now. One more challenge. Grab a spoon. Yes. Oh, my goodness. Yes. Oh, my God. Alright. - James? - Yeah, James. Yes. Well, hello. Zoe. Amazing. You guys, go do the challenge, right? Yeah, go and do the challenge, guys. We got nothing to say to you. Just go. You're losing, you're losing! - Alright. - Sorry. Don't say sorry as you leave. I am so far behind you, I'm gonna overtake in the worst possible way ever. Our people have to do nothing for him to catch up. Desiree, it's Ian. Alright, let's see what this one is. Brilliant. Here we go. Is that a nappy? I think they might put a real weasel in there. I think if they do release weasels, which I think is what's going to happen, and then they flinch, they'll get slapped on the hands. Yeah. I think you're right. Okay. James looks like a gigantic baby... - Oh nice! - With a beard. Full beard! And a mortgage. Hello. Are you brothers? Why am I so nervous? I never get nervous. Please take this off. Oh, you scared me then. She jumped when the blindfold came off, I'm not confident about this. Laura. Stuck in... the wrong trousers, it seems. Are you gonna do something? Just stand there. So you gonna be slapping my hands? They look like rat shoots or something. Or hamsters. I hope hamsters. They're nicer. Ian, you mad lunatic, are you ready? I am ready. Maybe not. This is going to be amazing. Can we just have a minute of silence for Ian, please? Is that alright? Oh, no. Yes. Yes. You got a new friend. Like a ferret or something. Oh my... No. Does it bite? Hello, buddy. Lovely. He likes them. - James likes the weasel. - I mean... Yes. It's licking me. It's like moisturiser. Flinch. Yep. Understated Michael reaction as always. That's a flinch. He really is a big baby. Look at him. The weasel hasn't even touched him yet. Rest in peace, Lloyd. Blatant flinch. Oh, man. Look at Lloyd's face. Look at it. Ow! It's tickling me. So glad I'm not them. - He likes it. - Look at James. There's another one. More weasels. I wanna give it a cuddle. What is he doing? No... It's like the weirdest high-five I've ever had. No. No. No. No. No. Two weasels. Where are those weasels trying to go exactly? Oh, kitten. It's gonna be over soon. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's amazing. Lloyd, I'm pretty hopeful that you're going to be top of the loser board. Yeah, I'm super hopeful. Ian made a real weasel of himself by flinching 15 times. The ferrets were really ticklish, in that general region. Dominique, Zoe and Michael also did badly. Lois, Laura and James only did minorly better. But it's Craig who held it together with a fantastic score of five. Before you can work it out, - let's look at the loser board. - Yes! Yes! This is how it affects the hosts. Seann is definitely safe with a final score of 26. Zoe helps Desiree score 28. And lan's screamer means Lloyd finishes on 29, and is doing the Flinch Forfeit. Yes! Yes! So close. Loser! Loser! - Come on. Get up. - Come on. Flinch. Flinch. Flinch. Oh Lloyd, look there's a bull. Say hello to the bull, Lloyd. So while Lloyd prepares himself for the forfeit, time to reveal which of the eight players flinched the least overall. And it's tattoo cleaner Craig, who is crowned Flinch Champion. He was a barrel of laughs in Splash. I need this on my bed. He didn't crash out during the Brass Band. Am I supposed to be electrocuted, right now? And he clearly loves - small furry animals. - You seen how pink that is? He is immortalized in the Flinch hall of fame for eternity. - Just turn to your right. - This is amazing. Give me your hand here. - There we go. - Surprise. Happy birthday. - Look at that. - Right. Make sure that you hold those not touching the metal ring, Alright. Don't get tired. Don't worry, this will go pretty quickly, actually. Hey guys, what are the rules? - If you flinch, you get zapped. - Yep. Oh, my God. This is so much fun. I can feel it, mate! Now it's personal. Okay, stop. No, seriously, stop shooting. Stop it guys, stop shooting!
