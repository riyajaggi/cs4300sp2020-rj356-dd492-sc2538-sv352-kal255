 Do... not... flinch. So flinching equals consequences. Just don't do it. Competing in this episode, a bodybuilding grandmother, - a YouTuber... - Boom! A fearless marketing manager, a double-jointed barista, a keen teaching assistant, a student with time on his hands, a small but mighty secretary... Do you think I'm cute? And an out-of-work actor...

 Slightly over-acting there. PLEASE WELCOME YOUR HOSTS: Desiree, a warm-hearted American, Lloyd, a sharp-tongued Englishman, and Seann, who's behind them all the way. Let the games begin. Welcome to Flinch. You eight are about to be put through a series of nerve-wracking and anxiety-inducing challenges, To make you flinch. The person who flinches the least in all three games will be crowned the winner. Simple. If you are wondering why you have a spoon in your hand, wonder no more. Place your spoon into that bucket. We're each gonna pick one of you to play for us in the games. Every time you flinch, we score a point. The one of us with the most points at the end will face our very own Flinch forfeit. Here goes. I have got this person. My fate is in your hands. Hi, I'm Lewis. I'm 20 years old. I'm from London, England. Boom! - Are you scared of anything? - The parking attendant man. - Traffic warden? - Traffic warden, yeah. Scared of any creepy crawlies? Yeah, spiders. So traffic wardens and spiders. I mean, that is niche, isn't it? The next spoon. Who is this? - Oh no. - It's me. Why do you already look scared? No reason. Hi, I'm Kate. I'm... oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Kate. I'm... what... uh! What sort of things are you normally scared of? Quite a lot of things probably. It's not a great start, but it was nice to meet you, at least. Hello. - Hello. - Hi. My name is Tanjiana. Come on. Tanjiana, where you from? - I'm from London. Whoop, whoop. - Alright. Born and bred. Okay, excellent. Sorry, you do know it's just called London, don't you? "London. Whoop, whoop." As long as you are not as freaked out as Kate is, I'm gonna be okay. Think you can beat your friend here? Yes. Alright, that's all I need to hear. I think I'm gonna be alright. Guys, let's crack on. So the intrepid eight make their way to the first challenge, on the other side of the farm. And one thing's for sure, it's not going to be cute, fluffy or adorable. Let's see what it is. Slap Head. Alright, this is my girl. Just keep walking. Now, stop here. Oh... What do you think the game is? I'm guessing those small boxes have a surprise, and if they flinch they're gonna slap themselves in the head. Boxes. Pie. Okay, that's a lot of boxes. Glad I'm not doing this. What is that face? She knows what's coming. Why is my stomach rumbling as well? - You want the cake, Lloyd? - That is exactly why, yeah. - There's Kate. - She's already scared. What the...? - What is this? - You're about to find out, kitten. - Kitten. - He looks cheerful. Right, there's my Lewis. - I need to put on my face now? - Here we go. Alright Tanjiana, you ready? More than anything. - What was that wink for? - Yes. Wow, that was confident. Stay focused, Kate, - on those cream pies. - Am I gonna pie myself in the face? I think so, yeah. I think that's exactly what you're doing. Flinch! Oh no, please. No. That's way overboard. So Desiree, Tanjiana scored you your first flinch. Her recovery is great, but... Tries to dodge it as well. I'll have to eat my way free. That was a flinch. - Oh, Lewis. - To be fair, the air horn. Took that judgmental teenage look off his face. Oh, he's done it again. Come on, Lewis. - She closed her eyes. That counts. - Oh, yeah. Did not let her get away with it. Oh, my God. I love the way they try and pretend they haven't flinched. Look at her arms. Do you think big arms makes the game harder? I think flinching makes the game harder. Dan is... Playing the perfect game. Wow. Wait for it. Look at the state of her. Just washed my hair. I'm ready for this one. No you're not, Lewis. No, that was a flinch, kid. Yeah. This is brutal. Oh no. Get that cream in your face. Hopefully done with the cream. - Tissue anyone? - Delicious. I think this might be quite equal. I would like to see the scores, if that's okay? The worst flincher is Lewis with eight. Jack-in-the-boxes, I hate Jack-in-the-boxes. Tanjiana, Dang and Kate are not much better. Luka, Henrietta and Sharon scored fewer. But the winner is Dan, who didn't flinch at all. My mind was set. I started singing a song in my head. You might've noticed me going like this in between, 'cause I was like, yep, just keep singing. What do I have? Let's look at the loser board. Well, Kate scored Seann six. Tanjiana hands Desiree seven. And Lewis puts Lloyd in the running for that forfeit with that score of eight. Shame none of them picked Dan. - Still on an equal playing field. - Still a bit angry with Lewis, - but not a problem. - No, no, we're good. So let's get the spoons in and pick our next players. Tanjiana! Yeah. Sharon. Hi, guys. My name's Sharon. Three children. Two granddaughters. And nobody but nobody can break me. - Hello, Sharon. - Hiya. Hey, if you do well in this challenge, I'll make you a protein shake. How does that sound? - Protein shake's rubbish. - She's heard that pick-up line before. Right, who's this? I haven't met you yet, Henrietta. Hello, I'm Henrietta. I'm from Hungary, but live in London. People think I'm very cute, but I'm very strong. Do you think I'm cute? Yes. I'm small but strong. You're small but strong. Strong things come in small packages, so I believe that, yes. - Thank you. - Yep. Shall we just get them on with it? - Yes. Come on. - Go on. Tip The Skip. - I reckon there's a skip involved. - Yeah, and it's gonna get dirty. That's a washing machine. At least you get to wash your clothes. Oh, it's Lewis. I mean, he'll definitely need to clean his pants after this. Like a lamb to the slaughter. Or the laundrette. That is a washing machine coming towards your head. It's like going in the electric chair. - That is awful. - That is really bad. Big-hearted, big-armed Sharon. She looks like she could be in WWE. Yeah. Doesn't seem happy. - I think we might have a flincher here. - You think? - Yeah. - You're not gonna kill me, are you? Didn't you read the small print? You pull those handles and get tipped into what looks like British haute cuisine? She's a pretty girl. She isn't gonna wanna go in that water. I'd be terrified by this. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. You have tested this out, how many times? We have not tested it. Sharon, are you ready? I'm ready. Hit me. I'm ready. I think. There's the fear. There is the fear. She's doing complex maths in her head. Lordy, Lordy. Oh, my God. When's it going to happen? God's got me. How is she so confident? - What is that face? - She fully did Edvard Munch's The Scream. - Like... - What is that face? No, don't flinch. What the...? Sharon, all that muscle and you wimped out on me. Bring it on. What do you mean, "bring it on"? You're flinching. - Is that it? - I'm scared now. I'm nervous. We haven't even started. Oh, yes. - Go on, Sharon. - She figured it out. - Round Two. - Amazing. Yes. - She's learning. - Yep. So cool. Yeah. See, we never get Dan. - Flinch. - See ya. Pathetic. Ugh... He's just getting the swill out of his mouth, I think. Lloyd, those things in the skip, they're called vegetables. At least they're getting one of their three-a-day. - Five-a-day. - Five-a-day. - One of their five-a-day. - Yeah, that does make sense, yeah. She's just tapping out every... Stop doing that! Put your hands down. It's not even coming at you any more. Drenched. That was bad. But hey, everyone's been bad. Bring it on. Wow. So I suppose that means we're gonna need to look at the scores. Thanks, Henrietta. Henrietta is the worst flincher with nine. I had that feeling. "Oh, my God, I'll maybe die." Next are Tanjiana, Dang and Lewis. Kate and Luka share four. But Dan and Sharon win the game with three flinches each. It was brilliant. I loved it. I wanna do it again. What does that do to the loser board? Well, Sharon's three flinches move Seann on to nine. Desiree jumps to sixteen. As does Lloyd following Tanjiana's antics. So they're now both in the line of fire for the forfeit. - Okay. - It's neck and neck. Yeah, I know. - For you two. - Yeah, exactly. You're sitting pretty. - You're not, like, out of it completely. - Yeah. No, I know, but you two are equal. - Well, listen, we've got one more to go. - Yeah. Shall we get the spoons for one last time? - Oh, no. - Kate. - Get in. - She's already... - She's already like this. - That is a result for us. Yes. Alright, Kate, I believe in you, alright? Oh my days. Look, who I have got. - Hello, mate. What is your name? - I'm Luka. Whatever you do, just be natural, okay? - Do you have a job? - I'm a student. Psychology and Linguistics. What are you doing here, mate? I don't know. I just fancied a bit of adventure, bit of fun. Are you scared of anything? I have a weird phobia with, like, birds, chickens. Are you aware of what's around you? I know, I've been kind of in my Zen moment. Luka, you've just changed the game. You've been facing your fears all day. - I'll take that. - Okay. Lewis. Please do me a favour, 'cause it's very tight, and I do not want to do a challenge. - At all. - I got you. Good luck, Lewis. Come on. Go on, my son. - Go on, my son. - Alright. Right, for the final time, stand up - and get on with it, guys. - Get on with it. You might as well go and get changed for the challenge. Yeah, that's fine. You know, I did my hair and everything today, I don't wanna get all... - It does look really nice. - Thank you so much. It's gonna be covered in swill by the time we're done with the day. - Touch wood. - Yeah. Electric Feed. - They're getting electrocuted somehow. - Yes. Just take a turn to your left for me. Okay, this is Dang walking in. Those jumper cables are never a good sign. There's Dan, he's the real contender to be overall Flinch Champion. Why's everyone doing the zombie walk? - I just heard a scary noise. - Okay, just round you go. Here's Kate. All my hopes of not doing a forfeit, in her hands. Ohh. Oh my God. What is that noise? It sounds like a lion. Sharon is getting better at not flinching. I reckon it's between her and Dan to become champion. Lewis looks tense in his shoulders. Yeah, no. He's... yeah. Right, Luka, please, just do what you can do. Oh, my God. No. - What is that? - Protective headgear. Oh my God. Is that an emu? - Oh, my God. - I don't know what they are. - I think they're... - Emus. - Yeah. - Emus. - Ostriches? - No. They make that noise when they're angry, Lewis. I know they're not peacocks. - Peacocks? - Why does it sound like there's a lion? Luka's scared of birds. Brilliant. One thing I didn't want is animals. Yeah. No! Luka. An unequal playing field here. Luka. Just when they thought they were close enough, they get wheeled closer. I really don't like them. They always spoke well of you. Oh, my God, he's in an electrified trolley. Lewis, are you ready? I'm ready. He's not ready. Oh, my God, don't do that. - None are. - Don't open the gate. He's gonna emu me. No way. Really? They've been turned into human bird buffets. So far, everyone's holding their own. And more importantly, so is Lewis. - Kissing, that's a good sign for me. - That's promising. Is that nice? - She's flirting. - She's like mama emu. Flinch. Yep. No. First flinch to Lewis. And another point for me. Great. Exhilarating. That's a flinch. Luka. Flinch. Are you trying to ruin my life? Please can I get out now? Go on, ruin her life. Come on. Their beaks are so hard. You're hungry. Wow, Sharon's relaxed. What about her big rival, Dan? Eyes. Sorry Dan, closed eyes count as flinching. - Do not close your eyes, Kate. - Yes. Come on. Where's your friend gone? Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. Yeah, Lewis was dreadful, but apart from Sharon, I think everyone else was too. Right, well, you know what that means, don't you? - Yeah. - Oh, come on, please. Kate's the worst flincher with nine. I feel like they have red eyes. I might be making it up in, like, a post-trauma. Followed by Lewis, Tanjiana and Dang. Dan and Luka do better. Henrietta only scores one flinch. But it's Sharon who wins with a faultless zero. - What? - Yes. What does that do to the loser board? What is the loser board? Oh, I think I'm absolutely safe. Seann is definitely safe, with a score of seventeen. Desiree finishes with twenty-five. And Lloyd moves to twenty. So Desiree is the loser. Yes! Yes! Oh, yes! Get up. Flinch, flinch, flinch! So while Desiree is led to her forfeit, time to reveal which of the eight players flinched least overall. And it's grandmother and bodybuilder Sharon who is crowned Flinch Champion. She out-jacked the Jack-in-the-boxes. Hiya. Stared off the flying washing machines. And henpecked the hungry emus. I'm so not as bad as these lot. She enters the hallowed halls of Flinch fame for eternity. Come on. You can do this. The rules of this are simple. A train is gonna come out this way. It's gonna have lots of smelly things on it. It's gonna come round. If you flinch or if you breathe through your mouth, you're gonna get zapped by Lloyd. Hiya. Here we go. - Oh, God. - Oh, gross. Oh, baby. - You ready? - No. Maggots. - Stay relaxed. - Oh, my God. Don't wave it on to me, Seann. You flinched. This is some kind of hell. Oh man. I think I'm gonna vomit. Oh, my God, maggots. - Durian fruit. - Oh gross. I'm... okay. I can taste it. Remember, no breathing through your mouth. No breathing... that's a flinch. Oh God. That's horrible! You keep flinching. Don't back it up. What's wrong with you people? Surstromming. Fermented Swedish fish. Look at that face. Sorry. That takes the cake, right there.
