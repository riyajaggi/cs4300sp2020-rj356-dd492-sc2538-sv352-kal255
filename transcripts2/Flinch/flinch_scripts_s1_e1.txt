 [BANJO MUSIC PLAYS] [NARRATOR] In the hills of Ireland is a remote farm where these eight contestants will face three fiendish games designed to make them flinch. Our three hosts each choose a contestant. Every time their contestant flinches, the host gets points. Whichever host ends up with the most points, has to face their own flinch forfeit.

 and Seann... Well, he's already had enough. Let the games begin. Welcome to Flinch. You eight are about to be taken out of your comfort zone, and put to the test via a barrage of unnerving, often agonizing challenges. ALL DESIGNED WITH JUST ONE THING IN MIND: To make you flinch. And each time you flinch, TWO THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN: You'll get pain and we'll get points. The one of us with the most points at the end will face our very own flinch. You will each have a spoon with your face on it. - Yeah. - You're going to place that spoon into this bucket. And we'll pick one of you to play for us in the games. [LLOYD] And remember, the more you flinch, the more points we get. So please don't flinch. I think I'm going first. Yes. Hello. Alright, okay, now you're giving me fever. What's your name? Hi, I'm Callum, I'm 28. I'm a brick layer. I'm from Newcastle in the UK. I got a whole dossier. - Alright, cool. - Do you want my CV as well? [SINGING IN HIGH FALSETTO] What are your fears, though? I'm really, really, really scared of pigeons. - I'm sorry. - Alright. - I'm still counting on you though. - I've got you. Alright. Let's go, I have... - Hello. - Hi. - What's your name? - Emily. Hi, I'm Emily. I'm a really competitive netball player, I have never been beaten on the courts, and I will not be beaten here today. What are your fears? My main fear is being buried alive. So all I've got to do is hope that you don't get buried alive? Pretty much. I'm very happy, thank you. - No worries. - Great. [CHUCKLES] - What's your name, mate? - My name is Dimeji. - Dimeji. Nice to meet you Dimeji. - Nice to meet you too. What do you do for a living? - I'm an actor. - You're an actor. So you're acting like you're enjoying this now? I'm 24. I'm from Essex. And I'm a cool cat. - Scared of anything? - I'm scared of spiders, heights, deep water. Brilliant, okay, loads. - [LLOYD] Shall we? - Yeah. Let's get on with the show. Good luck guys, go on. So the fateful eight make their way to the first challenge on the other side of the farm. Let's find out what the first challenge is. Wet Your Whistle. Wow, look at this. Here's my boy. [DESIREE] Is that a steam whistle? [LLOYD] And a tank full of water. Oh, my God, he's actually shaking. [DESIREE] Oh wow. That's not good. Oh no, man. Why am I on this show? Why are you already freaking out? Ah, man. If those whistles go off and they flinch, they get wet, your whistle's spun around. Callum, baby, are you ready? No, not ready. [SCREAMING] - [LLOYD] Flinch. - [SEANN] Flinch. [LLOYD] He's not singing now, is he? He looks soaked. So attractive. It's up me nose. Come on, Callum. Learn from the previous time. [SEANN] And back down you go. Look at him go. [DESIREE] Another flinch, another point. That is insane. [SEANN] There's my girl. Come on, Emily, get me off to a good start. So, I feel like I'm at a theme park ride, that I don't want to now go on. But, I'm stuck so I don't get a choice. Her fear's being buried alive, I don't think she's gonna be buried. I'm gonna be fine. Oh, my God. She's enjoying that, that's the main thing. [GIGGLING] She's gone insane, she's lost her mind. [LLOYD] Come on, Emily, settle down. Nailed it. Thanks, Emily. [LLOYD] Here's my guy. You know, it's the height, like... Yeah, I'm pretty high up. - He's scared of heights and water. - Yes. [SEANN] He ain't gonna make it. - Oh, brilliant. - Flinch. Ah, brain freeze. He's not happy. He's not happy. - [STEAM BLOWING] - Oh, my God! [LLOYD] And down you go. [SCREAMING] [STEAM BLOWING] [LLOYD] Bye, Danielle. Have some water. Whoa! Yeah, don't try and talk. [SEANN] Right, let's see what Shattner is like. [LLOYD] Like stone. - [DESIREE] Can I swap Callum for Shattner? - [LLOYD] Nope. [LLOYD] Right, fresh meat, let's see who takes a dip. - Let's do it. - Ready. Is it too late to say that I can't swim? - Look at the scores? - Yeah. [NARRATOR] The biggest flincher was Callum, with ten. Followed by Dimeji, Karl and Dominique. Aaron and Danielle share three. Emily flinched twice. But it's Shattner who wins the game with a single flinch. [SHATNER] I'm a daredevil, I'm gonna absolutely destroy the next few games, you know. [NARRATOR] But how does that affect the hosts? Emily hands Seann two. Dimeji gives Lloyd six. And Callum gives ten points to Desiree. Thank you, Emily. Well, I kind of want to find out who we get for the next challenge. Bring on the spoons. Hello Dominique, what do you do? I am a beautician. I'm 27. I'm a glamour queen. Always spread a little sparkle wherever you go. What are your fears? - Heights. - Okay. - Very common. - And clowns. - Clowns! - Also, still pretty common. Lloyd, you can go! - Sorry. - [DESIREE] Alright, me next? Hello. - Hello, lovely. - Hi. She's like, I'm gonna get my frame up right, for sure. [DEE DEE] Hi, I'm Dee Dee AKA Danielle Smith, and I'm from London in the UK. [DESIREE] Think you've got a handle on this challenge for me? Um, I don't know. Oh, come on. Confidence has gone. I'm hoping. You know, don't hope, just do. Alright, toughen up, Danielle. I've got... the most terrified man in the world. - How you doing? - Hello, my name is Karl. I'm 23 years old. I'm from the Philippines. FIRST THING I NOTICED: A lot of tattoos. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I wasn't complimenting them. Do you have a job? I'm a chef, breakfast chef in a cafe. So you're cooking breakfast every day? Yeah, basically. I wanna be your best mate. - You are my best mate now, Lloyd. - Good luck. - Thank you, Lloyd. - Take care, see you. Guys, good luck. Get the heck out of there and don't flinch. Stand up and get out of there. - [LLOYD] Body Pops. - [DESIREE] Body Pops. Then we're just gonna walk sideways. [SEANN] What is that? A balloon suit? [LLOYD] It's just like something from Up. Dominique, she's small but tough. She'll be alright. She's wrapped up in a carpet. [SEANN] I think that's from my gran's house. [DESIREE] Danielle's tough. She might win this for me. [LLOYD] My little breakfast buddy. [SEANN] Lloyd, he looks confused. [LLOYD] Yeah, he always looks like that though. [SEANN] That's a car battery. [DESIREE] Which means electricity is involved. Don't touch the hoop or you will get a shock. Oh! - Oh, great. - Oh. She is really wishing she'd read the contracts. [SEANN] So, Dominique, even though there is a man holding a gun pointing towards you, are you ready? I'm ready. Yeah mate, "I'm ready." Yeah! - Is this guy gonna shoot me? - I think he is, yeah. Or am I gonna get electrocuted every time I touch this? He's worked it out. [ALARM WAILS] Whoa! [ELECTRICITY CACKLES] [LLOYD] Flinch. Oh my... To be fair, everyone's gonna be scared of this thing. [LLOYD] This can't be legal. [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] - [YELLS] - It's a cute flinch. - Come on. Okay. - I'm ready. - Are you? - [SHRIEKING] - [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] I wasn't even ready. [DESIREE] Hold it together, babe. Flinch. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] - [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] - Ouch. Yep, that's a flinch. - [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] - [YELPING] - [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] - [SCREAMING] Yes. Zen Master Dominique. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] Spoke too soon. [SCREECHING] My goodness. [YODELING MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, my God, that was right at me. - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] - [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] Is it done? [KARL] Nope, doesn't hurt. [GASPING] Try harder. - What? - Yes. I got this. I'm not even gonna flinch. - Wow. - [LLOYD] This guy's great. I love him. [KARL] Harder. Harder. Oh my days. - You're missing shots. - He's invincible. You can't even aim. No. That was insane. [DESIREE] That was... unbelievable. - Nothing. - Yeah. Know what I'd like to do? I would like to see the scores. [NARRATOR] The biggest flincher again was Callum with nine. Followed by Emily, Dominique and Dimeji. Shattner, Danielle and Aaron do better. But the winner is Karl with three flinches. I think I know what the loser board might look like, but can we see? [NARRATOR] Dominique's seven gives Seann a total of nine. Karl also scores Lloyd a nine. And Danielle's five means Desiree's facing the forfeit with fifteen. I'm getting the I off my head soon. Top of the loser board. Man. At least I'm winning something. - That's not how it works. - I'm too good at losing, guys. - Shall we go again? - Yeah. Look who I've got. Dimeji, my friend and pal. Oh, God. Oh yes, come on. Who've you got? Yes! [LLOYD] Callum. Hello... Dominique. I'm gonna smash it. Thank you. Guys, get on with the challenge. Okay. Shall we see that final challenge? - See how we're gonna do. - Final challenge, please. [HOSTS] Electric dining. [LLOYD] Is that a clothes peg on his nose? [DESIREE] And we have a train track. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] Smell the freshness. [SEANN] I wish I had one of those pegs after dinner with you, Lloyd. Oh, my God. What is that? Callum is not gonna enjoy this. If anyone throws up, it's this one. I can see some hands. Just moving. Mysteriously. [DESIREE] Oh, gross. [SEANN] Rotten meat. [LLOYD] Oh, maggots. I feel like something with a really strong smell is gonna come through. Something's gonna go round the track, he's got to breathe normally. If not, he gets a shock. Dimeji, are you ready? Let's do this. Yeah, seems pretty confident. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [DESIREE] It all rides on this game, boys. Here we go, come on. All right, relax. Come on, mate. Oh, my gosh. Oh no. Look at him. [DESIREE] Oh, babe. Look, he looks like he's gonna cry. This is disgusting. - [GAGGING] - [LLOYD] Flinch! - [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] - [YELPING] Stop holding your breath. I'm not holding my breath, man. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [SEANN] Ah, he's got maggots on his lap. That's the worst part. I'm just waiting for it and as soon as it comes, and I know what's happening. - She looks like she's panicking. - Yeah. Just need to breathe normal, yeah. [DESIREE] That's right, girl, just relax. Come on, I need this one, Dominique. - [LLOYD] I'd be panicking. - [SEANN] Yep. Yes, ice queen. Yes. Oh, my God. Look at his face. - He's gonna puke already. - His stupid, stupid face. [GAGGING] [SEANN] Hold it together, Callum. He's gonna puke. [DRY HEAVING] - [ZAPPING] - [YELLS] Yes, girl. You are my saviour. [LLOYD] Her nose mustn't work, that's what's happening. Stinking Bishop, it's a cheese. I think it's actually alright. Is that weird? [SEANN] What? Lovely. That one's fine. Come on, faster, fan boy. - [SEANN] Between me & you. - [LLOYD] Yep. Musky. I like it, keep wafting, waft harder. Ah, he's into it. - What is... - Maddening. [SEANN] That's it, Callum. - [GAGGING] - [ZAPPING] Don't breathe so deep, Callum. - ["MEXICAN HAT DANCE" PLAYING] - [ZAPPING] - [ZAPPING] - [YELLING] [LLOYD] Oh, Dimeji, you've stitched me right up. You can relax. [SINGING] What is he doing? What is he doing? - [COUGHING] - [ZAPPING] What even is that? Oh, it's the... Oh, it's the... No! This is a great challenge. Oh, no! So wrong. - Do you wanna see the scores? - No. [NARRATOR] The player with the weakest stomach is Dimieji with thirteen. Not much better is Callum, Karl, then Aaron. Emily and Shattner both flinched six times. Danielle five. But it's Dominique who plays the perfect game, with no flinches at all. Yes. Yes! Yes, girl. Yes. Amazing. - Go to the loser board? - Yes. - Oh, that is me. - Is that you? Yeah, I think that is me. [NARRATOR] So which host faces the forfeit? Callum brings Seann to 21. Dimeji finishes Lloyd on a whopping 22. While Dominique saves the day for Desiree with 15. Lloyd is the loser. So close! So close! - [CHEERING] - [DESIREE] Yes! Come on, baby. Let's get you dressed and ready. [CROWD CHANTING] Flinch. Flinch. Flinch. [CHANTING] Flinch. Flinch. Flinch. [DESIREE] Yes! [NARRATOR] So, while Lloyd is led to his forfeit, time to reveal which of the eight is Flinch Champion. And, it's the small but mighty, Dominique. She took a dip on Wet Your Whistle, was shocked silly in Body Pop, But when it came to planet Earth's smelliest foods, she was in a world of her own. She arrived as a mere mortal, but now lives in the hallowed halls of Flinch fame for eternity. Bye. [ROOSTER CROWING] [DESIREE] There we go. Hey. [MOANING] Now, I'm getting back here, because you know it's safe here. - What's going on? - I'm gonna be the maniac over here at the controls. - Doing what? - Lighting these guys up, that are next to you. There's gonna be big, huge shooting flames like a Kiss concert going off. Alright? You are definitely gonna flinch at some point. And when you definitely flinch, I'm gonna press this. - And then we're gonna put you out. - [DESIREE] Yes. I don't wanna do this. Let's go. - [DESIREE] Yep. - Flinch. [SCREAMING] [DESIREE] You're safe! I didn't flinch. I'm sorry, baby. You're giving us such a good show though. [SEANN] Flinch. [ALL LAUGHING] Ah, look at my trainers. Alright. Alright. Flinch. That tastes disgusting. That was at the same time. This is what Lloyd looks like when he's been to the gym for 5 minutes. [BEETHOVEN'S 9TH SYMPHONY PLAYING] [SEANN] Flinch. Yes. Bye, Lloyd. See you, Lloyd. - Can you unstrap... - You'll dry out soon. - Goodbye. - Can you come unstrap me? Desiree, come back and undo me. Who's doing that? No, absolutely not. Absolutely not!
