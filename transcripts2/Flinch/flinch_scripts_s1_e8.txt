 So flinching equals a whole heap of punishment. Are you with me? That is hot! Just don't do it. - [GROANING] - [SCREAMING] [ROOSTER CROWING] [NARRATOR] Competing in this episode, a personal trainer who packs a punch. I can crush this. An all-American engineer. A flexible festival worker. I'm so nervous. A horror movie buff. I am not that tough. Cheeky fish-and-chip shop server.

 A grandfather who's really happy to be here. A party-loving beauty queen. Hi! [LAUGHS] A sales assistant, who wants to make a big impact. Bring it on. AND HERE ARE YOUR HOSTS: Desiree, who walks it like she talks it. Lloyd, who has a spring in his step. And Seann, who's just putting one foot in front of the other. Buckle up, the ride's about to begin. Welcome to Flinch. You eights players are about to show us what you're made of via a barrage of tense, terrifying, often excruciating challenges designed to make you flinch. It's simple. If you flinch, even an inch, it matters, it matters a lot. [SEANN] The person who flinches the least across all three games will be crowned the winner. [DESIREE] Right, listen up. It gets complicated. You guys are all holding spoons with your faces on them. Put those spoons into this bucket. [SEANN] We're each gonna pick one of you to represent us in the games. Every time you flinch, we score a point. [DESIREE] The one of us with the most at the end is going to have to face our own Flinch forfeit. I have got... you, my pal. Hello, I'm Dan, and I'm twenty years of age. Gotta beat the best... Gotta beat the rest to be the best. You know what I mean? What is the scariest thing you've ever done? I was at kids party, with kids popping balloons, and I hate balloons. Do you know what this thing is, mate? Don't laugh. It's a serious thing. Anything else, mate? Fill me with more confidence. - Vans! - Vans? Yeah. Right, I think I'm gonna... - Lose this one. - Lose this one, yeah. Let me grab a spoon. - Hello. - I'm Ashraf. My wife got me into this. I'm sure she's in on it with these guys. - First challenge, welcome your wife. - Yeah. Oh. You actually flinched then as well. - Good luck, Seann. - Yeah. No. Thank you. [DESIREE] It's my turn. You. Hello! - Is that you? - Gosh, it's me. I'm Zoe, I'm a personal trainer from London. I can crush watermelons between my thighs. Hello curly-haired sister friend. Okay. So how much can you squat? 140 kg. - Oh, snap! - Same. Think I'm whipping both of you. Okay, right. That's enough talking. Let's do this. Good luck, Zoe. [NARRATOR] So the fearless eight trot off to the other side of the farm. What awaits them there can only be described as, well, indescribable. [LLOYD] Bootiful Pork. [ROOSTER CROWING] [DESIREE] Oh my... that's a big foot. - Big foot! - Yeah, big foot. It's "bootiful." - Where am I? - [DESIREE] Alright. That's my girl. Come on, Zoey kitten. [SEANN] Is she pretending to be an animal? Petrified... What is this? [DESIREE] That boot's aimed right at her rear. If she moves her head, - I think that boot hits her. - Hits her in the butt, yeah. Right, come at me then. Come on. Oh my... [LLOYD] There he is, my Dan. And he looks terrified. [HOSTS LAUGHING] - Mate. - Just... [DESIREE] Freaked at the concept. He's petrified. Oh, you got to be kidding me? [SEANN] Ashraf, you can beat this. - Come on. - [LLOYD] I mean, he doesn't seem too happy there, Seann. His wife's gonna love watching this happen. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [SEANN] Don't listen to them, Ashraf. [ASHRAF] Is that for me to be sick? Oh no, it's chickens. - Oh no, please no. - [LLOYD] Chickens! What kind of over-fed, obese chickens would make... [SNORTS] [RUMBLING] What the hell was that? Is that a bull, are you kidding me? - What is that? - [DESIREE] It's not a chicken. Oh, my days. - [SNORTING] - [HOSTS LAUGHING] [SEANN] That's a flinch. Yes! [LLOYD] If he gets booted, it's hello pig and hello points for me. - Oh, you're rubbish, Dan. - Stinks. - [LLOYD] Yeah, you stink. - [GRUNTING] Thank you, sir. May I have another? [SEANN] That's a flinch. [GRUNTING] - No. - [SEANN] Flinch. [GROANING, LAUGHING] [SEANN] Ashraf's wife is gonna love this. I'm not. [LLOYD] Nothing like a romantic dinner for two, hey? [SEANN] Suzie's got the hang of it. And Cade, too. I grew up on a farm, so I'm extremely comfortable right now. [DESIREE] I knew it, Cade's a farmer's boy. [SHRIEKING] Oh, this is awful. No one really kind of shot out from the rest, - did they? - Our three were the worst. Yeah, they were the absolute worst. We got that kind of luck. And let's have a look at the scores. [NARRATOR] So Dan made a pig of himself with seven flinches. [GROANING, SIGHING] Ashraf, Talia and Zoe do slightly better. Jimmy and Jai-Jai did well. But it's Cade and Suzie who saved their bacon by both scoring a perfect zero. And this is how it affects the hosts. Zoe hands Desiree four. Ashraf gives Seann six. And Dan lands Lloyd seven, and front line for the forfeit. Yes, Zoe. Yes. That's about right. From the off, I wasn't really confident with Dan, and he's followed through. Living up to expectation. - Another go? - [BOTH] Yeah. [SEANN] Let's do the spoons and get our players. Hello, Ash. Now, what I don't feel confident about is that if you're on my team, I feel like that puts me on your wife's bad list. No, you don't wanna do... I know, right? I have got this person. Oh, hi there. What's your name? Suzie. I'm 21. I'm from Crawley in England. I'm a bit of a nutter. You dunno what you're in for. Hoping you're gonna make me feel better after that round. - What do you do for a living? - I work in a chippy. Yeah. Well, could you get freebies at the end of the night? - Yeah. - Woo-hoo! Oh, my God. - That is on. - She's great. See you at the end of the challenge. - [LLOYD] Look at that. - [DESIREE] Yeah, electric. [SEANN] Who have I got? - Oh... - [HOSTS LAUGHING] - Hi, Dan. - Yes. [SEANN] Look at the way he stands. Is there anything you can tell me to make me feel confident about you, going into the next challenge? Look, I'll try my best. Can you try someone else's best? Yeah. - Cade. I'll try to be Cade. - Alright. Great, that's, well... Get ready for your challenge. Get out there guys, and get on with it. - [HOSTS] Rubber Bandits. - [ROOSTER CROWING] [LLOYD] Ah, this is brutal. [SEANN] Okay, so lots of huge elastic bands and some over-sized fireworks. Oh, stop it. [SEANN] The fireworks go off, she flinches. And she gets snapped. [GASPING] Stop it. I can't handle it. I can't... I'm gonna cry. You should run in there and rescue her. Yeah, as if. Are you serious? Don't... ah, this is like my worst nightmare, this one. Come on, hold it together. [SEANN] Don't let me down, Dan. Whole bunch of rubber bands, ah. I'm actually petrified. [GASPING] Ash, come on. Do it for your wife. No, please don't. Don't! - Come on, brave face. - Oh, God, no. Ready when you guys are. I'm cool, calm and collected. I got this. - [SHRIEKING] - [DESIREE] That's a flinch. [LLOYD] Ah, thanks for that, Suzie. The mother of all finches. And more points for me. - I'm fine. I'm not scared. - That's it, go on. That's already a flinch. She's pre-flinching. [YELLING, LAUGHING] [SEANN] That's a flinch. [HOWLING] - He is useless. - Yeah, seriously. On the knee cap. [SHUDDERING] [DESIREE] And Cade is flinch-free again. Or maybe not. [SHUDDERING] [DESIREE] That's a flinch. - [YELPING] - Oh! [SEANN] That's a flinch. Oh, it's stinging. [GRUNTING] I wish I could cry now. - That one's gonna be hard. - Yeah. Let's see what it did to the scores. [NARRATOR] Ashraf's the biggest flincher with seven. - [EXPLOSION] - [HOWLING] Are you having a laugh? Dan and Jimmy and Talia are close behind. Zoe and Suzie share four. Jai-Jai did better. But it's farmer's boy, Cade, who wins with a single flinch. Okay, so then what about the loser board? Suzie's four takes Lloyd to eleven. Ashraf's seven also takes Desiree to eleven. While Dan's six brings Seann up to twelve, and now he faces the forfeit. Overtaken me, boy. - Yeah. - Yeah, I think basically whoever gets Dan. - Yeah. - That's the way this is gonna go today. Yeah. We have a final game to play. Yeah, let's do it. - Oh, flip. - [HOSTS LAUGHING] Hi, Dan. This is hopeless. - Try not to die. - Yeah, exactly. [DESIREE] Alright. Hey. I think that's Suzie right there. ♪ I got yo' girlfriend and you can't have her ♪ And I have got... This young chirpy fella. [ALL] Jimmy! A man who looks like he doesn't know what is going on. Hi, I'm Jimmy, and I'm from Malaysia. Jimmy, do you have a job? I am a student. - [LLOYD] What do you study? - Law. Law, okay. So I mean, you're suing if this goes wrong. Aren't you? Are you scared of anything? The way we're talking, you're not flustered, but I've seen you flinch quite a lot. What scares you? I'm scared of a lot of things to be honest. - Well, thanks for playing. - Yeah. Off you go. Let's see what we got for the next challenge. - [DESIREE] Hot Under The Collar. - [ROOSTER CROWING] [EXHALING] Oh, no. [LLOYD] He's got to stand... [DESIREE] And get hit by a bunch of fire extinguishers, or... - Wow. - Yeah. Could do with a chair. - [SEANN GROANING] - [DESIREE LAUGHING] Hold it together. [EXHALING QUICKLY] I feel like I'm going to wee myself. [DESIREE] Oh, come on, Suzie kitten. [LLOYD] So this is my boy, Jimmy. Jimmy, you look absolutely petrified. - Are you ready? - Yes, I'm ready. [GROANING] - [DESIREE] No. - [LLOYD] No. That's a distinct "no." What is going to happen? These fire extinguishers look like they're gonna hit me with something. Are they? When is it gonna come? [SEANN] Flinch. [LLOYD] I mean, that is terrifying, no wonder Jimmy's lost it. [YELLING] [DESIREE] That's a flinch. [YELLING] [HOSTS LAUGHING] Impressive. That's terrifying. [DESIREE] Not that impressive, that's a flinch. So that happened. [DESIREE] Yeah. - Whoa! - [DESIREE] That's a flinch. Look at his hair. Oh, my God. I'm swallowing it. Just shut your mouth, Dan. I hope that's water. [LLOYD] Cade is looking confident. [DESIREE] Yep, there's a new sheriff in town. Unflinchable. - Yeah. - I want him. - Mm... - [DESIREE LAUGHING] [YELLING] [GIGGLING] I feel like I've wet myself. And I can't tell you if I have or haven't. Let's have a look at the scores. I don't want to. [NARRATOR] For the second time, Dan is the worst player with seven. I'm really rubbish at not flinching. Closely followed by Suzie, Ashraf and Jimmy. Talia and Zoe flinched twice. But it's Jai-Jai and for the second time Cade who win with perfect zeroes. What does the loser board look like? [NARRATOR] Jimmy takes Lloyd to a score of sixteen. Suzie leaves Desiree on seventeen. And Dan's fear of fireballs mean Seann finishes on nineteen. Unlucky Seann, the forfeit is all yours. [LLOYD] It's Seann! lt's Seann! [CHANTING] Flinch. Flinch. Flinch. [DESIREE] Yes! [NARRATOR] So while Seann gets ready for the forfeit, time to reveal which player is crowned. Flinch Champion. And it's American engineer Cade. He avoided the boot in Bootiful Pork. He didn't snap in Rubber Bandits. And he very much kept his cool in Hot Under The Collar. He now joins the elite few in the Flinch hall of fame for eternity. Ta-da! [DESIREE] Yay! This is feed. You can have a bit if you want. - Thanks, Lloyd. - No worries, mate. Thank you very much. It stinks. Not sure that's the feed, mate. Kenny, can I have one of your little pals? - This is a chicken. - Yep. The chicken's gonna go on a little adventure. - You've got food. - It's looking at me. Yes. - No, genuinely. - [DESIREE] You smell like food. ALSO, LITTLE FACT: These chickens haven't eaten for a day. - Are you ready? - No. You flinch, you get zapped. [CONTESTANT] Oh, my gosh. - You'll be fine. - Good luck, Seann. Yeah. I can't get my head any further back. [DESIREE] No, you cannot. Yeah, no. - Oh no. Oh, oh no. - [WHIMPERING] [DESIREE] That's definitely a flinch, is it not? Yeah. It's a flinch. [SQUEALING] I mean, this is not looking good. That's all flinching. Yep. - [ZAPPING] - [SCREAMING] [DESIREE LAUGHING] Flinch! - I think I'm doing alright. - Sure, yeah. You're doing great. Don't look up. [CONTESTANT] It's eating your head. No, no, no. [SCREAMS] - [DESIREE] She is hungry. She wants you. - Don't want this guy feeling left out. What? Oh, my God. This is terrifying. It's eating my shoulder. - [CONTESTANT] He flinched. - [SCREAMING] [FOLK MUSIC PLAYING]
