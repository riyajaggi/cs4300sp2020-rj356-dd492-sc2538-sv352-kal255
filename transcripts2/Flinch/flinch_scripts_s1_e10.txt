 Lloyd, he didn't come here to lose; And Seann, who nearly didn't come here at all. Let the games begin. [APPLAUSE] Welcome to Flinch. You eight players are about to be pushed to the limit, via a series of extremely excruciating challenges designed to test you and ultimately to make you flinch. [LLOYD] It's really simple. FLINCHES MEAN TWO THINGS: Pain for you and points for us. And the one of us with the most points at the end of the show is going to have to face our very own Flinch. [ALL] Ooh! [DESIREE] You should be holding a spoon with a picture of your face on it. You're gonna put those spoons in that bucket. [DESIREE] And we'll each pick one of you to play for us in the games. [LLOYD] See, I told you it was simple. But remember, the more you flinch, the more points we get, so please don't flinch. Right, me first. The person I have got is... Hello! [ALL EXCLAIMING] Ha! Hi, my name's Holly, and I'm so competitive. Ha! - Already you seem very, very nervous. - I am. Do have any fears? - Dolls. - [LAUGHTER] That hasn't instilled me with any confidence whatsoever. [DESIREE] I think I should go ahead and pick. Hello, gorgeous. [SCREAMS] I see you're already famous in your own group. What's your name? - My name's Bobby. - Hi, Bobby. I'm Bobby. I'm worried that I'm gonna ruin my face. I need to look good. What do you do for a living? I'm an aesthetics practitioner. So basically I just put fillers in people's faces. I make lips bigger. - Cheeks. Jawline. - So if you had to fix. - Seann's face, what would you do? - What? What? I haven't got enough filler but we'll try. - I'm joking. - I can't believe this. - Bobby said it, not me. - Unbelievable. I'm evil and I love you. Alright, I think I might have picked a winner, I hope. Alright, Bobby. It's you and me. [SEANN] Grab one as well. Who is this? - Hello. - Hello. Hi, I'm Matt. I don't need protecting today, 'cause I'm hard as nails. - What do you do? - I'm a lifeguard. - Oh, a lifeguard. Nice. - Yep. - Brave. - Yeah. That's good. I'm very happy with Matt. - Great. - Yeah. Okay, let's crack on. Get out of here. [MALE NARRATOR] So our valiant contestants head off to meet their first challenge. In the games barn. Eight will enter but how many will leave? Right, let's have a look at the first challenge. [HOSTS] Feeding Bed. - [LLOYD] Is that some kind of trough? - [SEANN] Cattle prod. [LLOYD] Here she is, my Holly. Taking it all in. Oh my, she is not sure. Matt, my lifesaver. Oh, terrified. Getting in it, yeah? [LAUGHTER] Shut up, I'm scared. [DESIREE] Ah, there's my boy. - [SEANN] He's so well-groomed. - [DESIREE] Yeah. - Ugh. - [SEANN] Why the trough? - My feet are so smelly. - [LLOYD] Spa. Oh, mate. [LAUGHS] But he does look fetching, that is most important. Oh, cattle prod. Doesn't bode well, does it? [LLOYD] On the toes? Oh, man, that's cruel. [SEANN] Matt looks right at home. Oh, that stinks. Matt, I think you can do this. Are you ready? Bring it on. [GEARS GRINDING] What eats that? Something is going to eat them. [CLOPPING] [LOUD HUFFING] Lion? Yeah, farm lion. [LLOYD] Oh, no. Oh, God. [MATT] It"s beautiful. Aww. [SEANN] Flinch. Flinch. Straight away. [HORSE NEIGHS] [SMACKING LIPS] - That looks fun. - He actually enjoyed that. Yeah. - [ELECTRIC BUZZ] - Ah! [SEANN] Matt's not the man of steel I hoped for. That tickled. [SHUDDERING] Ah! - Look at him. - [SQUEALS] [LAUGHTER] - [ELECTRIC BUZZ] - [SQUEALS] [LLOYD] You're giving me points, Holly. [LAUGHTER] Not as many as Bobby's giving me. [LAUGHING] - [LLOYD] What is going on? - [SEANN] I don't know. [DESIREE] That is a friendly horse. Oh, my God. Totally normal. Happens to her all the time. Yes. [ELECTRIC BUZZ] Oh my, she is not sure. [SEANN] There's two of them. [LAUGHS] With that face, looks like he's enjoying it. Yeah, but I think that face always looks like he's enjoying it. You two look like you're having a lovely time. Please don't slobber on me. [WHINES] - [ELECTRIC BUZZ] - Ouah! It's all a dream. lt's all a dream. [LAUGHS] You alright, buddy? - Scores? - Yeah. Let's find out. [NARRATOR] Holly horsed around, and is saddled with ten flinches. Shinyoung, Bobby and Danielle managed to rein it in. Matt flinched seven times. Followed by Callum and Toby. But it's Charley who remained stable with just two flinches. [CHARLEY] This does not compare with anything I have done before. Not often do I sit in a hay coffin, and get eaten off by an animal. So random. So what does that do to the loser board? I think I know what it does, mate. Matt hands Seann seven. Bobby gives Desiree eight. But Holly's ten means Lloyd is galloping towards the forfeit. That's not great for me, is it? We knew that was gonna be the case. Yeah, we knew that was the case when we met Holly. [LAUGHTER] - Shall we go again? - Yeah. Let's have the spoons. Oh, hello gorgeous. Hey, Charley. Hi, I'm Charley, and I am cat-obsessed. Meow. Forgot to say I was from Essex. [LAUGHS] What do you do? I'm a receptionist and makeup artist, but like not together, so that's two jobs. Yes. So by day receptionist, by night makeup artist, or in the reverse? - Yeah, something like that. - Alright. I am counting on you. Be brave for me, alright? - I will do, babes. You can count on me. - Alright. - [CHEERING] - I have got this young man. Whoo! - Toby, how are you? - Nervous. I'm Toby. I'm from Surrey in the UK, and I put the 'stud' in student. [DING] - [PRODUCER] One more, but more conviction. - Yeah. - I don't believe you. - Okay. There anywhere you go that's like a happy place? If I sort of close my eyes and imagine I'm at the pub with the boys, having like, you know, buy-one-get-one-half-price drinks. I think I'll be at ease. "The boys" sound like the poshest group of lads ever. "Yeah, I was just down the pub with the boys, Toby and Rupert." I think you're the poshest man I think I've ever met. I'm rooting for you. Let's go for those half-price beers. - Absolutely. - Okay. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Don't be Holly. Don't be Holly. Don't be Holly. Bobby! Bobby, I'll make you a deal. If you get low on flinches... - Okay. - I'll take you out shopping. Okay, that's a deal, babe. I won't flinch. I won't flinch for you, I promise. That's the spirit, Bobby. Brilliant, go sit down. You're gonna do great. Shall we see what the next challenge is? Yeah. - [SEANN] Door Stopper. - A bunch of slamming doors, I bet. [LLOYD] Toby. Posh Tobes. Up he gets. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. It's the poshest cuss ever. "Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear." [METAL RATTLING] [TOBY] This is cozy. He sounds like an estate agent. "This is cozy." [HYSTERICAL LAUGH] Look at him. - He's got his jacket on. - Yeah, he does. This can't fall down, can it? That would be my first question as well. You lot are loving this. Yes, that's very much the case. [LAUGHTER] [LLOYD] Toby, no flinching, okay? In your most courageous voice, are you ready? [IN DEEP VOICE] I'm ready. - [HEART THROBBING] - [EXHALES DEEPLY] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Oh, that's switch doesn't look good. I hate these awkward silences. [CHAINSAW REVVING] [LLOYD] Is that a chainsaw? [ALL] Wow! Why did we need to add a chainsaw to this? [BUZZING] [SEANN] Flinch. Oh, dear. [CHARLEY] Oh, my gosh! [LLOYD] Yeah! [DESIREE] Yeah but it's points for me. Oh, come on. Not funny. Oh, man. Bobby, no. [SEANN] No, I don't want those points. [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] There you go. - [LLOYD] On his jacket. - Bring in the makeup. This ain't cute is it, this? Look at him. [SEANN] Yep, that's a lot of face powder, Bobby. - Oh. - Oh. Oh, okay. This one's never seen a power tool up close. Oh, sure. Why not? [SPLUTTERING] Oh, I should not have been talking at that exact moment. I've taken one with me, guys. [SEANN] Come on, Bobby. - Look at him. - It's so close though. [SCREAMS] Come on! Oh! It's not Halloween! [WHINES] [LLOYD] It's the Irish Chainsaw Massacre, this. It's good! [HIGH-PITCHED WAIL] - [CHAINSAW REVS] - [WAILING] Oh! Oh, my God! These are my favorite jeans. Chainsaws came out. - Even watching that I feel tense. - [LAUGHTER] - Ah, Charley. I'm disappointed. - Shall we have a look at the scores? - Yeah. - Yeah, let's do it. Shinyoung and Matt link up with eight flinches apiece. Then Charley and Holly on seven. Toby flinched six times. Bobby and Callum came close. But it was Danielle who cuts to the top with a perfect zero. [DANIELLE] Before I went into the game, I did really pray. I didn't even flinch for nobody. [SNAPS FINGERS] Hmm. What does that do to the loser board? Bobby's four takes Seann to eleven. Charley's seven gives Desiree fifteen. But Toby's six means Lloyd moves one notch closer to that forfeit. Yes. [SEANN] Okay, right, yeah. I can take that for now. One more challenge. Let's go for a pick. - [METAL CAN CLANGS] - Oh! - Ah, ha-ha! Yes. - Oh, no. I've got Charley. Oh... Charley, I'm currently top of the loser board. Oh, do you know what, babes? I'm gonna try my hardest. Okay, I believe you. [VOCALIZES] - Hello. - [SEANN] Okay, Shin. Well, you look very happy. Very bright. Very colorful. [LAUGHS] Yeah. Hello! My name is Shinyoung Park. I'm from Republic of Korea. I don't know why I'm here. [LAUGHS] Think you're brave? I think so because I went to Congo all by myself six months ago. Yeah, it was crazy. Do you think that I've selected a good spoon? Great. That's fine. Uh, hello, Toby. [ALL EXCLAIM] I don't know what you are about to face, but for me can you please go in there and just put a brave face on, don't flinch this time? Listen, I can't make any promises right now. I don't know if you should ever make any promises. So guys, off to do the challenge. Oh, my God, they've checked a cat in there. - Let's see what that challenge is. - Yeah, what are you? [HOSTS] Whipped Cream. [LLOYD] I hope Charley's the cat that gets the cream. Pretty calm about the thing. You gonna tie me up again? So, what's happening? Well, it's a pulley system. [DESIREE] And it's connected to that bucket. [NERVOUS LAUGH] [TOBY] God, it stinks in here. [DESIREE] Keep an eye on that bucket, Toby. That might just be my armpit to be honest. [LAUGHTER] What's in here? Holding on to something that looks like a toilet flusher. Ah, I'm screwed. Well, I'm looking at that, and that looks like it's going to spray into my face. [SNIFFS] Right Shin, are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Very confident. - She's having no problems. - Yeah, great. Who is that guy? [WHIP CRACKS] Someone's getting whipped. Aye aye. Yeah... Yeah, he's already lost. Hi. [SEANN] Ah, he's going to whip the metal jugs, not the people. Shame. Hold it together, Shinyoung. [SIREN CHIRPS] [SEANN] No, I've lost it. [DESIREE] That's another flinch. You're going down, Seann. Well, she's very sweet. [DESIREE] Come on, Toby. Get a grip, I need this. [TOBY] I think I know what you're about to do. Oh, dear. [WHIP CRACKS] [LLOYD] She flinched! Yes. [WHIP CRACKING IN A QUICK SUCCESSION] I'm lactose intolerant. Oh, my God. [LLOYD] Yes! Embrace it, Charley. [WHIP CRACKING, CAN CLANGING] - What? - See. [LLOYD] She is rock solid. I am winning this one. Yes, Charley. Not flinching at all. [SEANN] What is going on? - I love you, Charley. - She has her eyes on the prize. No. What's the point of wearing wellies, if they're just funnels? Unbelievable. So you, somehow, might have gotten out of this. [SEANN] I, somehow, might have been dragged into this. Yeah, and I think that I'm the one - who's most in danger right now. - We'll see. Let's look at the scores quickly. So Bobby got creamed with seven flinches. Toby and Holly, six each. Shinyoung and Matt on five. Followed by Callum and Danielle. While Charley whips it real good with zero flinches. Oh, that is amazing. Let's have a look at the loser board. Shinyoung keep Seann safe with sixteen points. Toby hands Desiree a grand total of twenty-one. Charley's performance saves the day for Lloyd, also with sixteen. Get ready Desiree. Oh, no! Get this on. [CHANTING] Flinch. Flinch. Flinch. [APPLAUSE] As Desiree is led to her forfeit, it's time to reveal our Flinch Champion. It's cat-loving Charley. She didn't fret while the horses act. Kept her cool while the chainsaw was through. And took a creamy whipping without once flipping. Come on, be nice to me. And now she lives in Flinch folklore forever! Meow! [ROOSTER SINGS] [LLOYD] Once we've connected these, they need to stay in the middle. If they don't, you're gonna know all about it. [DESIREE] This is your fault. [LAUGHTER] [LLOYD] If I were you, just face forward and just relax. - What the heck is happening behind me? - Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself. There's absolutely nothing to... [DESIREE] Such a party, Where you just balance two sticks in the middle of holes. - You ready, Seann? - Oh, yeah. [SEANN] A-one, two, three, four. Oh, son of a... [LAUGHS] [ELECTRIC BUZZ] [GROANS] [GROANS] I hate music. [GROANS] - [CYMBALS CRASH] - [DESIREE] No! [LLOYD CACKLING]
