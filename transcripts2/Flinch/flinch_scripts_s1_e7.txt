 Let's have it. Please welcome your hosts, Desiree, an iron fist in a velvet glove. Lloyd, an iron fist in a iron glove. And Seann, who's just really velvety. Come on in and let's have some fun. Welcome to Flinch. You eight are about to face a series of terrifying, often painful challenges, designed to make you flinch. The person who flinches the least in all three games will be crowned the winner. If you're wondering why you're holding a spoon with your face on it, then wonder no more. Each of you is going to put your spoon into this bucket. We're gonna pick one of you to represent us in the games. It's simple, you flinch, we get a point and one of us at the end will face a flinch forfeit. Right, me first. I have got this person. Hello, I'm Avishek. I have only one mantra: Do not flinch. Do not flinch. Do not flinch. Hello, my pal. What you do for a living? Design bridges and buildings for a living. And are you good at your job? Excellent. Very arrogant, early on. Really arrogant. - I'm quite happy with you, mate. - I'll pick a spoon. Who is this? - It's you. - It's me. Hi, I'm Katy. Uh, we're in a farm, and I love animals, so I think I've got this. - Katie, what do you do? - I'm a barmaid. So you deal with drunks? - Yes. - People going, - "Hey!" - Yep, that's right. So you deal with these guys on a regular basis? Pretty much, yeah. - Should I be confident with you? - Yes, definitely. - Good, I'm happy. Thank you. - Alright, I want one, let me see. You. Hi. Hi, my name's Collette. Yeah, let's do this. Woo! - Hi Collette. Are you tough? - Damn right. Are you lying to my face right now? - Maybe. - Okay. So this is not inspiring confidence in me. I think we should just go ahead and start playing the game. Get out of here, go. You're gonna need all the luck in the world. So the brave but foolish eight make their way to the first challenge on the other side of the farm. Hey, put that chicken down! Let's have a look what the first game is. Great Balls of Power. Okay, here's my girl. I can see what you have hovering above my head. Right, it looks like some sort of unlicensed hardware store. Why is there a power-saw? - What... - Gonna cut her in half. They're not real, are they? This is like a rural version of James Bond. Do you know what I mean? Like machinery coming down. I'm gonna be sick. What am I doing to myself? This does look terrifying. Shat happens if I nod my head and pull the string? Something is getting shot out of there. Okay, it's going to be interesting. She looks like she might punch whatever comes out. - Katy looks terrified. - Yeah. My man, Avishek. Okay, enjoy. Thank you. Avishek looks worried. Don't flinch. Do not flinch. Psych himself up there. Cannot hide the panic. Collette, are you ready? I don't think I'll ever be ready. Oh, my God. Absolutely ready. Do not flinch. Come on, Katy. Scared now. Ah, man. She does look good in that hat though. That's a chainsaw. Oh, no. - Flinch. - Massive flinch from Katy. And that is a point for you. Of course she flinched, it's a saw. Oh, my God, there's more. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God. Okay, that's not funny anymore. Do not flinch. Do not flinch. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! What is this? Yup. Mind my teeth. - No! - Do not flinch. Ouch. - No way. - What? What are the... She didn't move at all. - Strong. - Yeah, she's holding it in. Yes, big Nathan. No. Why's he not flinching? What? It's a saw, - coming at your head. - Are they in a happy place? Nathan's in his happy place. But Ying's even cooler. But only one of them can win. Come on, Avishek. Do not flinch. Do not flinch, Avishek. - That was a flinch. - Yeah. Come on, that's what you get. Oh, I flinched again. Do not flinch. Do not flinch. Definitely gonna have bruises after this. Why doesn't Katy try "do not flinch"? The thing is, I can't blame her. - Ow! - Yeah, you're telling us. He looks so happy. Okay, well, I think I lost that challenge. Yeah, I think we all lost that challenge, that was impossible. - I mean... - Just apologies all around, I think. So not following his own advice, Avishek did flinch eleven times. It was physical, and it hurt. He's joined by Katy, Ella and Collette. Tom, Malik and Ying do better. But it's Nathan who wins with a perfect zero. Could do it all day, walk in the park. "A walk in the park," dodging power tools no less. And this is how it affects the hosts. Collette scores Desiree nine. While Katy gives Seann ten. And Avishek propels Lloyd to the Flinch Forfeit with eleven. But there's still plenty to play for. Everyone we chose was kind of equally bad at that, which we understand, but let's move on to another game. Who you got? Hello Malik. Hey, my name's Malik and I'm a former athlete so... I got this. Come on, man. Are you a brave man? Always. All the time. "All the time"? Right now you're just being brave? I just did the chainsaw thing. I mean, I did my best. You squealed. What do you do? Right there. - A little bit like that, mate. - We've got a similar laugh. Go and get them. Cheers, Malik. Hello. - Alright, Nathan. - I'm Nathan. Mate, I'll take on whatever you're gonna throw at me. Let's do it. Is that it? Oh, so far I like everything about you. - Happy days. - Alright, you seem tough. You did not flinch at a chainsaw, which is amazing. What's the toughest thing you've ever done? Oh, mate, I'll do anything. "Oh, mate, I'll do anything." Oh, my God, the way you just said that, we'll talk after the show, alright. This is great. I believe in you, Nathan. I do not know what's coming at you. I won't let you down, alright. Ah, man. Just... you got to stop talking, but I don't want you to. Alright, go sit down. I have got... Collette. Yeah. Hi Collette. How are you, mate? Nervous. Which doesn't make me feel good. But it's a really bad chemistry you guys have got. It's your fault. Collette, you are the strongest person I have seen... Thank you. Called Collette. I won't let you down. Okay, thank you very much. Okay. Let's see what the next challenge is. In A Spin. In A Spin. Nathan, my dude. Alright, a wheel. This almost looks like fun. So there's balloons. Hello. Those balloons ain't gonna scare him any. On the platform, with both feet. Bring it on. It looks like some sort of unlicensed fun fair. Strapped up to a frame. Does he seems scared? Always got that look about him, hasn't he? Is there gonna be somebody - throwing knives at me? - She's hopeful - they're gonna throw knives at her. - Okay. I'm guessing I'm gonna be spun around a little bit, because of this lovely sexy harness. - Yeah. - Oh, what are they doing? Here's my girl. Come on, Collette. Oh, I can feel the tears coming again. Oh, God. Oh, this is so humiliating to my life. Why'd I do this? I can't even stroke my face. Brilliant, hasn't started and she's freaking out. I need a safe-word. She wants a safe-word. Can it be "pineapple"? "Pineapple"? Well, it's a common safe-word. I'll take your word for that, Desiree. Here's Ella. This can't be worse than the first challenge. I think it might be. You gonna be spinning me around? Same on the other side. My pick now, Malik the brave. - Seems alright. - Is this gonna spin? - It's probably gonna spin, Malik. - Fantastic. Yeah. But what are the balloons doing there? Oh, come on. Come on. Don't get me, why you aiming at me? Get the balloon. I think they're gonna shoot, if he flinches I think that's gonna spin. - Okay. Alright. Guess we gonna find out. - Let's see. - Malik, are you ready? - No! Get the gun away. Yep. I'm ready. Bring it on. This is tense. This is so tense. Don't do this... - Flinch. - Yeah, that was a flinch. No. Stop. Pineapple. That was a flinch. Oh wow. That was definitely a flinch though. Okay Collette, second chance. Oh, my God. You guys are hitting all my fears. Stop! Stop! Pineapple. What was that safe-word again? Melon? Orange? That's going real fast. It's faster than my washing machine. Come on, Nathan. I need you to not flinch. I don't know if he's actually alive. - What is wrong with him? - Oh, no. - He's dead inside. - Yes. That means he's not flinching. You got good aim. Ah, Malik. Malik, come on, man. Seems like it was fun though. - I think he's enjoying it. - Yeah. Whoo! Whoo! Okay, yeah. That was quite close. Oh, don't do that. Just stop flinching. You alright, Seann? How cool is your bruiser? - He looks like it's been shot at before. - Ah, man. Thought you could do better than this. Can Ying keep her composure? Yeah. Yes she can. This is insane. Health and safety is of paramount importance. Do not flinch. Good shot. Avishek, as strong as one of his bridges. Think you can bottle that braveness and feed it to Collette? - Poor Collette. - Again! Ah, brilliant. And there she goes. If she's sick, it's just gonna go back in her face with that visor on. Pineapple. Pineapple! Say the safe-word. Pineapple. This is very embarrassing. - Points, look at the scores? - Yeah, time for the scores. So Mr. Brave himself, Malik, scores eight. Worst part was the friggin' gun. Close behind is Thom, Collette and Katy. Ella, Avishek and Ying do better. But for the second game in a row the winner is Nathan with just two flinches. That was brilliant, I loved it. Can't wait to see what you got next. Those are the scores, - but let's look what that does... - Yeah, the loser board. Loser board! So Nathan keeps Desiree safe for now on eleven. Malik gives Seann eighteen. And Collette puts Lloyd on eighteen. With one challenge left it's all to play for. We still have another game. Come on, it's not over yet. Let's pick the spoons. I have... Katy. Katy. I'm top of the loser board, aren't I? - Yep. - It's gonna be tight. This person really needs to do well for me. - Yeah. - Who have I got? Collette. Alright. Hello, Avi. I can't call it. What do you mean? I've got Collette. - It might be just the... - Thanks for your support, Seann. Just do your best. I mean, it's gonna be tight. It's gonna... yeah, exactly. I reckon we just crack straight on to it. - Let's do it. - Let's get into it. What is this game? Chicken! Let's have a look. Mildly threatening-looking table and chairs. What is that? Feel like I'm gonna fall in a ditch. I don't know if it's better or worse than a ditch for her. - I wanna see how nervous she looks. - I don't wanna open my eyes. Shall I open my eyes? Open them. What on Earth? What is that? Is that a little train? I literally have no idea what is going on. He's losing it already. Go on, Malik. He's giddy. The most terrified woman I've ever seen. What the...? - Oh, yeah. - Cattle prod. - No. - Yes. No. Yes. No. It's not a good start. Is it chicken feed? Oh no, I'm not ready. He's freaking out at the feed. I hope they take it off soon. Katy, are you ready? Yeah, I think so. Oh, she ain't ready. I'm ready. I'm so not ready. What is that noise? That is a deep look of terror. That a chicken? It's a man, holding a chicken. Oh, I'm gonna cry. She's gonna cry? That's great. No, but Avishek's eyes are gonna pop out of his head. Do not bite. They don't have teeth. He's coming. - He looks quite calm. - Come on. - No he doesn't. - No he does not. I don't know if he knows what chickens do. Be good to me, do not bite. Do not bite. Do not bite. Do not bite. - Gonna rip your face off, Avi. - Do not bite. - Do not bite. - Flinch. - That was a strange noise. - No. Do not bite. Stay there. Here we go. Collette, I do not want to do the forfeit. Oh, my God, he's too close. Come on, be strong. Oh, my God, this is... Oh.. I give up. I give up. You've got possibly the worst, Seann. Oh, hello. More visitors. My money's on Nathan to win this one too. Maybe, but Ying isn't flinching either. Oh, my God. They're making it look so easy. She looks like a Buddhist monk in comparison. Oh my God, what is that? Katy, however... Katy, it's fine. Yep, that's flinching all over the place. Leave her alone, you animal. There's a chicken feeding frenzy going on. Avishek looks absolutely petrified. It's getting aggressive. He's touching my ear. - Stop it. - What are you doing? - Not another one. - I feel sorry for Collette. Oh, Thom. Look at him. He's got T-rex hands. Oh, no. I'm dead. I am dead. Ah no, I give up. Okay, I've officially lost this whole game. He's a scream machine. - I can't have more. - Trying to tap out. He looks like a chicken right now. Oh, my God. Right, so I think we should have a look at the scores. I don't want to. Let's have a look. Avishek flinches a massive seventeen times. They were coming for my neck. That scared me a lot. Katy, Thom and Collette are better. Ella and Malik do well. And Nathan's four means he finally loses out to Ying with a perfect zero. I didn't get the electric shock. We need to go to the loser board. I got the worst. Avishek's final freakout lands Desiree with a score of twenty-eight. Collette gives Seann twenty-six. Katie's nine brings Lloyd up to a final score of twenty-seven. Which means Desiree tops the loser board. - Yes! - No! Get in there. Avi, I will kill you. Flinch. Flinch. Flinch. So while Desiree is led to her forfeit, time to reveal which of the eight players flinched the least. And it's Man Mountain Nathan. He kept his cool when the power tools flew. I took it like a man. He didn't get in a spin when the sharpshooter shot. Thought you could do better than this. And was unflustered when chickens came to roost. It's all good. He enters the halls of Flinch stardom, until the end of time. You're approaching a chair. Ah, I hate the chair. - Your hands. - Put your hands here. - Okay. - It's so simple. Ready? Three, two, one. Ta-da! Right, basically there are Jack-in-the-boxes, you are not allowed to flinch when the Jack-in-the-boxes come out. - If you do, Seann, my boy here will... - Hello. Pop a pie right in your chops, love. Okay? Are you ready? - No, clearly not. - The main thing here... Don't flinch. Three... two... - She flinched. - No, I didn't. I hate all of you. She flinched! - That is a shame. - Two? I didn't flinch twice. You definitely flinched twice, mate. I had plans to go out tonight. No, cancel those plans. Cancel those plans, mate. - She flinched. - No! - She flinched! - Shut up! You look like you're in despair. Like, "What have I done?" "Who am I?"
