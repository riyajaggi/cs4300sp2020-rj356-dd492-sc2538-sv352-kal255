 And a retired parking attendant. Let's meet our hosts. Desiree, she's a little salty. Lloyd, he's kind of sweet. And Seann, well, he's just right. Let the pain, I mean, games begin. Hello and welcome to Flinch. You eight are about to face a series of terrifying and torturous challenges designed to make you flinch. The person who flinches the least across all games will be crowned the winner. But pay attention, this is complicated. You're each holding a spoon. Pop it in that jug. We're going to select a spoon at random, and pick one of you to represent us in the games. Every time you flinch, we score a point. And at the end, the one of us with the most points has to face the ultimate Flinch challenge. Ooh! Oh, no! Oh, no? That's not a good start. "Oh no!" Hiya, my name is Sinead. I'm a Welsh dragon and I'm doing this for my country. What are you most afraid of? Chickens, snakes... - Chickens? - Yeah. There's chickens everywhere, we're in a barn. Okay, I have got... this guy! Yes! Sorry? My name is Pinakin Barood, but people call me Pinakin, I love that. - Do you have a job? - No, I'm a retired person. So what did you do? - I was traffic warden. - You were a traffic warden? Know what you should do? Just pretend that he's just given you a ticket. - Yeah. - And see if he flinches. What you doing, mate? I was just in the shop for five minutes. He's so good... even straightaway. Off the bat, there was nothing there. - Good one, got a good one. - Really good. Alright, this is going well so far. I'm feeling lucky. Hey. Alright, this guy. What's your name? - I'm Dan. How you doin'? - Hey, Dan. Hey, Dan the man. - Alright, what do you do? - I drive forklifts. - You drive forklifts? - Yeah, whizzing round on little trucks. We're gonna have to translate everything he says. I sound normal, surely? Bring it at me. I'm going to smash this. Ow... Alright, off you go. So these fateful eight are off to the other side of the farm to face their first game. They're all smiles, for now. Tip The Skip. I'm never happy to see a washing machine anywhere. What is that? Brussel sprouts? Oh, it's wet. Oh, my God, you're proper strapping me in, aren't you? She's smiling. Seriously. Oh, here's my Dan. Come on, win this for me, baby. I'm not gonna get dumped in, am I? You're definitely getting dumped in there, bro. This is 'cause I'm vegetarian now, right? Bit worried now. Come on, Dan. Hard man. Strong man. Be my stunt man. Do not be her stunt man. Are you ready? I'm ready. Bring it on. Bring it on. Yep. It's gonna be brought, - and it's gonna be all on you in a moment. - Here we go. Looks like we've got ourselves a squealer. Oh, my God. What are you doing, Daniel? If you pull the handle up, you go down. That scream. - He is not as manly as we first thought. - No, not at all. Still very scared. Screamed like he was at the top of a rollercoaster. What? Who does that when they're scared? Does a fart noise out of their mouth. Does she know what she signed up for? I don't think she does. I don't think the washing machine does either. Focus, Sinead. Don't move a muscle. Oh dear. Oh no. - Honestly, she needs the vitamins. - Yeah. Oh, my God, I'm soaking wet. Absolutely hate vegetables, as well. I love being dunked in swill, but I can't stand vegetables. Okay, let's see Pinakin. He looks like he's angry that we've got him out of bed. - Not phased by anything, whatsoever. - No, no. Look at that. - Just have a smile. - A smile. He looks happy. - This is fun. - He got to sit down. Yes. - Go on, Pinakin. - Tense. It is tense. Not a thing. - Brilliant. - Wow. Looks like he's gonna give the washing machine a parking ticket. Yep. Uh-huh. Oh, my God. This is the most vegetables she'll have in her life. Dan, you are scoring me points right now. Why's he keep doing that? Why do I always get the screamers? The hardest man in Bristol... Squealed like a girl from Bristol. Yeah! No problem. I'm pretty relaxed about this, but... - let's look at the Flinch scores. - Yeah. So Dan is the worst flincher with seven. I'm a screamer. Jelena, Rosalind and Sinead have not done well. Laura and Mathieu did a little better. Charlie flinched twice. But the winner of this first game is Pinakin who didn't flinch at all. I think it's time to look at the scores. Pinakin's perfect zero scores Lloyd zero. Sinead hands Seann five. But Dan's screaming-fit gives Desiree seven. Pinakin, how did you stay so calm when there was a washing machine coming towards your head? This is game. I have to play the game. Okay. Alright. Thanks for clarifying. He's got really hypnotic eyes. Look, if you just stare at him. I did not have him down as a hero when he walked in. Absolutely. I reckon we crack on to the next round. Spoons please. Hey... Oh, my God, I'm so orange. Hi, I'm Laura. I'm twenty-two. I may be small but I'm not afraid of anything, so bring it on. What sort of things are you scared of? I'm not scared of anything. I'm a tough cookie even though I'm little. - I think I've smashed it. - Very confident. Okay, thank you. Your go, Desiree. Hello. Hiya, I'm Jelena. And I'm Lithuanian. And strong. And I'm ready guys, hit me. Hi. Okay. When are you at your toughest? I guess in my gymnastics. You got to be tough, you know. You've done gymnastics? Yeah. People who do gymnastics, like... You have to be really strong and compact. Alright, awesome. I feel great about you. Sinead. Unlucky. Yes! She's a flincher, you're toast. This is from the sublime to the ridculous. Sinead, what is the worst thing you have done ever? What? Like, what do you mean? - Killed someone? - No. Nothing like that. - Oh no, never mind. - What? This is unbeli... You've got a killer. Sinead's like, "I've never killed anyone, except that one time." Right, get off the hay bales and get in there. - Go, Jelena! - Okay, what's next? By The Seat of Your Pants. What's this? It doesn't look good, whatever it is. My Jelena is in some cute undergarments. Lloyd, it's kind of you to lend them your underwear. - Yeah, it's fine. - Oh, so she's gonna get yoinked up in that diaper. What's the game, do you reckon? Well, it involves power. Are they electrocuting? She's already getting a massive wedge, why do we need to electrocute her? Oh... What the...? They're so disgusting. Yeah. They're embarrassing. - Is this a nappy? - Yeah. Oh my God, can I keep these? Keep them? Those pants do not go with that face. Oh, here we go. Got the little baby Pampers there. Here we go. Jelena, that looks so scary, are you ready? Go on, hit me, baby. "Hit me, baby"? I'm ready. Probably not. What happens if I take my finger off the button? Oh no! Oh! Flincher! Oh, that'd be some serious wedgieing. She's a gymnast, she loves this. Whoa! Styled it out. Whoa! - What is going on? - Dan the screamer. Come on, Sinead. - Yeah, there you go. - Oh, no... Sinead! Okay Laura, my destiny is in your hands. She has no idea what to do. Is this like a staring competition? Yes, Laura. Well done. Why can't I have him? Wow. Really concentrate. Oh Sinead, that's more points for me, come on. - Gutted. - I flinched, didn't I? Yes. Yes, you really... See ya. - There she goes. - Oh Sinead, come on, mate. - I'm not very good at not flinching, am I? - Awful. You can't put your finger back on the button. It's Pinakin, wish I had Pinakin. He is a man of steel. He's not going to move, and like all true superheroes he's wearing his underpants on the outside. I love to play a game. - Good on you, pal. - Whatever it may be. - Pinakin. - It's a game, I'm just playing the game. You never know, he may be superhuman after all. Superhuman or not, a balloon might be his arch-nemesis. - Oh... - Wow. Oh, my... Nope. Nothing. Nada. He's SAS. He's got to be SAS or something. Oh, my days. Well, um, why don't we go ahead and take a peak at those scores? Yeah. The worst flinchers are Sinead and Rosalind. So I've realized I am quite a baby. Followed by Dan and Jelena. Charlie, Laura and Mathieu do better. But for the second game in a row the winner is Pinakin, - another perfect zero. - Boom! I have seen a lot of fireworks on a day of New Year, so I'm never scared about that. Let's see what that does to the loser board. Laura's tiny two moves Seann to seven. Sinead pushes Lloyd to six. And Jelena flies Desiree up to eleven, and in front position for the forfeit. Yes. You are... currently... the loser. Alright, you're catching up quick, if you get Sinead one more time. - I don't wanna think about. - I wanna just jump in - and pick our last round of players. - Go on then. I have got Dan the squealer. Yes. - Ha! - Pinakin. Yes. Pinakin, I've got absolutely nothing to worry about, thank you. Hey. Laura. Right, take the rest of them, and go and do the challenge. What's the last challenge? Cheesy Lover. Doesn't sound that bad, sounds quite nice. Here he is. Absolutely fine, looks like he's done it every day for the last forty years. Fine. A medieval torture device. Classic. What is... Oh my... This is psychotic. Mouse traps. Your fingers are put in mouse traps. They can take your fingers off. Luckily though, this is Pinakin. - Hasn't he got any fingers? - This is a bit of a weird device, - isn't it? - Yes. This looks a little bit scary. Oh, I mean, start the screaming. Oh my God, is there hamsters? What is that? No thanks. - There's the cheese. - Oh no, what is gonna come out? I would immediately eat that cheese. - Don't lick it. - Exactly, that's my girl. Not taking the bait. Pinakin, okay. Of course he is, but I'll ask anyway, Pinakin, are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. They're rats. They are rats. Yeah, that is a rat. - I can't do this. - Oh, hey, Laura. She looked that rat dead in the face and was like, "What's up?" - "You're late." - Never met a rat before, I don't think. This is like a mix between Ratatouille and Saw. This is my worst nightmare. - She's flinching some. - They've gone round back. Oh, no. That rat is bigger than his head. - Dan, just stony silence please. - Scream your face off. - Listen to Desiree. - Come on, do it. Yes, well done. Okay, that's what I'm expecting. - That's a flinch to you, Lloyd. - Big one. Um... I mean, just that coming down the barrel. Oh, God. Don't know how they're doing this. No, he's not coming into my... - Keep your mouth closed. - I think I'm going to cry. That's awful. Ow! Oh, not so cool now, Mathieu. Yeah. That tail was in her mouth. That's the grossest bit. Like he's got a beard. Oh, I can taste him. There's another one. Right, let's watch the master at work. He's trying to hypnotize us again. Look at that. I'm sorted. You two have scored loads. I'm sitting pretty. Oh my... Yes. - Oh my. - Seann, you okay, mate? Yes. Seann. Oh, there's more. Oh no. Oh yes, he's flinched. Oh, my God. Stop, Pinakin. What is that noise? Oh, no! - There's more. - This is it. Laughing and terrified at the same time. - Pinakin. - That's your man right there. He's got an entire opera about rats going on right now. Seann, this is karma. Let's look at the scores. How the mighty fall. It's more Pina-can't with fifteen. I'm scared only if they bite me. I'm ready to accept any challenge. Yeah, whatever you say, Pinakin. Mathieu, Charlie, Dan, equally bad. Rosalind, Sinead and Jelena do better. But it's Laura who does best with a magnificient three. - Yes, yes! - Which means that this is the loser board. Well, Laura's great score means Desiree finishes on fourteen. Dan pushes Lloyd to thirteen. But Pinakin's meltdown means Seann finishes oh a whopping twenty-two, and faces the Flinch Forfeit. Yeah. It's Seann! Yes! Flinch, flinch, flinch! Yes, Seann. Seann heads off for his forfeit. Now, let's reveal which contestant flinched the least. And it's Laura. I feel like a queen. She enters the Flinch hall of fame forever! Yay me! Ta-da! - Balloons. Balloons. - Yeah. Yeah. - I don't know what's gonna happen. - Seann. - Seann. - Oh, no, you're above me. Hiya, mate. So, you got these balloons around you. They're gonna get big. They're gonna pop. If you flinch, you're gonna get potatoes all over your head. Pinakin, this is all your fault. That freaked me out... already, it's just blowing up. - Come on. - It's the anticipation. Oh... Mother monkey boy. What are you doing? What are you doing? It's like it's alive. Vegetables are bad for you. I have a headache. This is all the food that Lloyd has left over. Hello. I nearly didn't... Pinakin, this is all your fault.
