 And that's it. A delivery driver who loves a laugh. A bubbly mum. And a shop assistant. And here are your hosts. Desiree, she's enjoying the Irish summer. Lloyd, he's enjoying the Irish fire water. And Shawn, he's enjoying the pain, of course. Let's have some fun. Welcome to Flinch. You eight players are going to be pushed to your limits through a series of gruelling, flinch-inducing challenges. And each time you flinch two things are gonna happen, you'll get pain and we'll get points. It's that easy. We're trying to pick the person who flinches least, because at the end of all of this, the one of us with the most points has to do a Flinch of their own. Alright guys, get your spoons in that bucket. [LLOYD] And remember, it's simple, the more you flinch, the more points we get, so don't flinch. - Right. - Alright. - Here we go. - I'm gonna do this first. Alright, come on. Who's this? Hey, my name is Jorge. Jorge, are you even old enough to be outside without a chaperone? What's going on? Chaperone! What's the scariest thing that you've had to face in your life so far? - Exams. - Yeah. Right, here we go. [ALL] Ooh! Who is that? My name is Sandeep. I'm hard like a rock. What is the worst thing you've done? Marriage. Marriage? So he's ready for anything at this point. - Grab a spoon? - Yeah. Okay, straight away. This guy. What is your name, sir? I'm Rustam. What's happening? I don't know what I'm about to do, but it should be fun. I'm looking forward to it. Bye. Are you a brave man? Eh... Oh well, that's filled me with no confidence whatsoever. [SEANN] I've had it. - [LLOYD] Let's crack on. - [DANIELLE] Yeah. No flinching, Rus. [AUDIENCE CHANTING] Rustam... Zen. [SEANN] Zen. [WHINNIES] [NARRATOR] Off the eight players go, to the other side of the farm, like lambs to the slaughter. What's game one all about? [DESIREE] Potato Head. [SEANN] Oh, brilliant. - Jorge is first, your guy. - Yes, my guy. Very confident, wasn't he? [LLOYD] What's that? That's a giant hopper, but what's in it? [DESIREE] Lunch? [LLOYD] I see rubber, is that a balloon? Right here's a balloon, and there's another one. He's pretty intelligent though, he can identify... - Ballons. - [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That's another one. Yes. Why's he so happy? Yes, Sandeep. [DESIREE] Just two large men, hanging out in a barn. - [SEANN] With a bunch of rubber. - [LAUGHTER] [SEANN] Yeah. [LLOYD] Kimberley. They're all just taking it in. Oh, no. - He almost... he almost flinched already. - That does not look good. You ready, Jorge? Of course I'm ready. - He suits dungarees. - He does, yeah. Well, he was only wearing them two years ago. [CHUCKLING] [LLOYD] Here comes the air. [AIR FIZZLING] Oh, my God. Jesus... Jesus... [DESIREE] It's only a balloon, Jorge. Nothing's happened yet. [JORGE SQUEALING] Ah... Oh no, this is not gonna be good. - [SCREAMING] - [ALARM BLARING] - [LLOYD] Flinch. - [SEANN] Flinch! Dinner is served. [SLOW-MOTION SCREAMING] [SEANN] Come on, Rustam. It's just a balloon. [BALLOON POPPING] - [DESIREE] There you go. - Flinch. [LLOYD] Come on, Sandeep, don't let me down. - [BALLOON POPPING] - What? He didn't even flinch. - [AUDIENCE CHEERING] - Yes, Sandeep. - [LLOYD] He's my hero. - [SEANN] Nothing. That can get pretty big. [YELLING] Ow. [YELLING] [DESIREE] Oh, come on, Jorge. Look, he's terrified. [SQUEALING] Oh, my God! - [BALLOON POPPING] - Oh, my... ouch. Ow! It's only balloons, Rustam. Come on. Man up! - Is this thing even gonna... - [BALLOON POPPING] - [SEANN] Get your five-a-day, Rustam. - [LAUGHTER] Stop! Flinch, straight flinch. Alright. No, this is too big. Oh, my God. Look at him. Come on. - What is he... - Yes, Sandeep. [CHUCKLES] - What? - Yes. How is that even possible? [YELPING] [SCREAMING] Shh... What...? Ow. - [HOSTS GROANING] - I don't want it to be another big one. [SCREAMING] [YELLING] Why? Why, why, why? Why is it that big, though? No, no, no! [SCREAMS] - He can't get that scared. - He's pathetic. - Yeah, this is so bad. - You've lost this. [SEANN] Why is he holding his crotch? That's not right. It's just too big. [SCREAMING] [DESIREE] Why is he screaming like a baby? Big one. [CHUCKLING] - Oh, Sandeep. - Something's happening. - Look, he's bored. - Nothing. Come on. This is nasty. [SHRIEKING] [DESIREE] Woo, that one flew. [LAUGHTER] [YELPING] [LAUGHTER] [SHRIEKING] - Oh, my days. - That is unbelievable. [LLOYD] I love this man. I hope his wife forgives him. Oh, that is amazing. So let's have a look at the flinch scores. [NARRATOR] So Jorge is terrified of balloons. Who knew? Eight flinches. Rhianna, Kimberly and Terri were just as bad. Rustam flinched seven times. Then Emily and Matt. But the winner is Sandeep, who played the perfect game. No flinches. [SANDEEP] I see the big balloons, different colours. I love balloon more now. Ready for next round. Yeah. So that means Jorge hands Desiree eight. Rustam puts Seann with seven. Meaning Lloyd is sitting pretty with the score of zero. Sandeep, thank you very much. You are my hero. Let's go again. Can we get the spoons in? Yeah. Hey. Rhianna. Alright, Rhianna. Hi, my name's Rhianna. I'm really excited and I can't wait, so bring it on. What are you scared of? Anything with water. Sorry, Rhianna, how the hell do you wash? - Sponge. - She might stink. Delicately sponge. Sandeep, Sandeep, Sandeep. Hey. Hi, my name's Matt, and I'm here 'cause my mom said I needed to get a hobby. Matt. Big, manly Matt. What are you scared of? Apart from the sun. - Probably girls. - Girls? Do me and Matt look related? Are you my dad? Yes. Dad! What? Nice one, Matt. Nice one. - [DESIREE] Where have you been? - I don't feel confident at all. Thanks, Matt. Oh, no. [SEANN] It's Jorge. - It's levelled itself out. - Yeah. Right, it's now time for your next challenge, so guys... off you pop. [CHEERING] Let's have a look at the next game. What is it called? - [DESIREE] Wheely Close. - [ROOSTER CROWING] [LLOYD] Oh, look at those. - [DESIREE] What the hell is that? - [SEANN] A giant toaster? [BANJO MUSIC PLAYING] [DESIREE] What's happening? [ZAPPING] What's the... Oh, my God. That's like a bed wired up to a battery. What! [SEANN] Ah, the apple of my eye. Okay. What is this? Come on, Matt. Is that a battery? [SEANN] Think it is, mate, yeah. [LLOYD] Emily. There's tires in front of me. [DESIREE] Oh, how's that work then? - So the wheel's gonna come in. - Yeah, so the... He's gonna get scared. He's gonna go back. He's gonna get electrocuted. So I've got a choice between a smushed face or electrocution? I could go either way. Matt, are you ready? I'm ready. My legs are even shaking. If that drops... [DESIREE] Oh, you've not prepared your son for this, Seann. Terrified. - Come on, yeah. - [LLOYD] Yes, Sandeep. - Come on. - [LLOYD] This doesn't look good for me. Breathe. Do it. [LLOYD] His hair's gonna go on fire. [SCREAMING] What! Oh, it does not feel good. - [SEANN] Fireworks time. - [ZAPPING] I'm actually scared now. - Rhianna. - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - I wouldn't be cool with it either, girl. [SHRIEKING] I mean, I can't say I blame her. Oh my God. What the...? - [SHRIEKING] - No, no, don't. That's not flinching. - [GASPS, SCREAMS] - [LAUGHING] Ah... whoa! [SEANN] Rustam. - [LLOYD] He looked like he enjoyed it. - [SHRIEKING] - [BLOWING RASPBERRY] - [LAUGHTER] Flippin' hell. - This is gonna be pathetic. - Jorge, just chill. Yeah, see? I told you. Damn it. He's amazing. That scraped my head, just. Didn't flinch again. - Brave face. - Nothing. Oh... [GRUNTING] [LLOYD] Matt can't stop. No, thank you. You know what, if this tire gives me a good haircut, I'll be very impressed. Ooh. - [GASPING] - I don't believe this. If that was a balloon... [SHRIEKING] [SHRIEKING] Ooh! Oh, God. I need you to focus, son. Look at the size of this one though. It's not a girl. I've got a body like a twiglet. Like, that tractor tire's gonna crush me. That will squeeze me and turn me into... a flat Asian pancake. Oh, here we go. - [GROANING] - [SEANN] And again. No, what are you doing? Oh, my God. Oh my God. Come on! Yes! [LLOYD] He's gone from cry-baby to a mini-Sandeep. That's what I thought, tire. [SEANN] He's talking to a tire. No! [SHRIEKING] [DESIREE] Rhianna. Right, let's have a look at the flinch score. Rhianna "wheely" didn't like this one. Eight flinches. Closely followed by Terri, Rustam and Kimberley. Then Matt and Emily. Jorge flipped the script. While Sandeep again refused to move a muscle. Zero flinches. [SANDEEP] Nothing has scared me so far and no one can stop me. Yeah! Let's look at the loser board. [NARRATOR] Jorge's one means Lloyd is only on one. Matt's six hands Seann thirteen. But Rhianna's eight takes Desiree up to sixteen. This next round... - I'm so nervous. - Just one more. The gap isn't big enough, that we're all still in it. - Yeah, that's true. - That's what's scary. - I'm not safe yet? - No, I mean like, if you get like Rhianna, and it's all about water, you're going down, bro. Yeah, let's bring on the spoons. Okay. - Kimberley. - Kimberley. Yeah. [SEANN] No idea what to expect. Hi, my name's Kim. I am so ready for this. Watch this space. - Hello, Kimberley. - Hello. Hello, what do you do for a living? What's your job? I actually work in a chemical factory, and the impressive bit about it is I drive a forklift. When I saw you I thought, "Of course, forklift driver." - Yeah, right. - Obviously. - We all thought. - Typical forklift driver here. Right, okay. Be brave. I have... Rhianna. Matt. Yes. Seann's son, AKA "The Disappointment." Alright, it's time. Out you get, you guys. Right, time to find out what the next game is. - [DESIREE] Chicken. - [SEANN] Chicken. [ROOSTER CROWING] Okay Kimberely, you said you were ready. Let's go. What's that? [SEANN] Some sort of medieval contraption. Oh, my God, I can smell animals. [HOSTS, AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Okay, what's happening here? - Oh, come on, man. - I'm scared. [DESIREE] Nobody likes wearing the cone. Oh, she's scared already. Are there chickens over there? [LLOYD] That is the correct answer. Chickens are calm, at least the chickens are calm. What are you gonna do with that? So... if they flinch they get cattle prodded? - Yes. - Kimberley, are you ready? I'm ready. [HOSTS LAUGHING] Like, actually, not cool guys. Are you kidding me? - What is going on? - What is going on? This has turned into a horror film. Is this chicken feed? Oh, my God, it stinks. Think I'm gonna make some friends. [LLOYD] Ah, your son's making friends. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [SEANN] Lloyd, I imagine you've got one, and that's how you eat. - [LLOYD] Yeah, pretty much. - [DESIREE LAUGHING] Bring on the chicken. - I like a redhead. - He's beyond ready for this. Like he might like this. Oh... [LLOYD] Oh, come on. Look how scared she is. Oh, babe. [LLOYD] Oh, she's gonna absolutely lose it. I'm going from third to first here. Kimberley's smiling. [YELPING] - [DESIREE] Flinch. - [YELLING] Oh, my God! - [KIMBERLEY YELLING] - [LLOYD] That's a flinch. Wow. - Yes. - Flinch. [SHRIEKING] [YELPING] Oh, that's fine. - That is fine, see. - Yes! [DESIREE] He's afraid of chicks, not chicken. I'm sorry, this is very cute. [LLOYD] Rustam loves it. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [SHRIEKING] [LLOYD] Look at her cheeks, bless her. [YELPING] [LLOYD] Her hair was in there. - Taste nice? - [DESIREE] Aw... How is that possible? [SANDEEP CLUCKING] Why is he enjoying it? Oh, my God. [SHRIEKING] Kimberley. Wait, can you just wait? - [CHICKENS CLUCKING] - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [YELPING] Yeah, I am quite nervous now. Are they bringing a second chicken for him? Oh, hello. Sorry, ladies. These are the only ladies he can handle. I love it. Oh, and I think this is number three. - [LLOYD] Three chickens. - Hello. Living the dream, baby. Living the dream. [WHIMPERING] It's touching me. - [ZAPPING] - [SHRIEKING, LAUGHING] What is going on? [SEANN] Looks like those chickens haven't eaten for a week. [LLOYD] They're having a great time. The chickens are loving it. [LLOYD] You've cost me big time, Rhi-Rhi. [MATT] Later, girls. [SEANN] My son is alarmingly calm around chickens. [LAUGHTER] I have got absolutely no idea who won or lost that. Let's have a look at the final flinch scores. [NARRATOR] Rhianna tops the charts again with a massive nineteen. Then Terri and Emily. Kimberley flinched six times. Rustam and Jorge played good games. Matt only flinched three times. Whilst Sandeep proves he may not be mortal after all, with his third perfect game in a row. Oh, wait, let's see the loser board. What's the loser board? [NARRATOR] Okay, so Kimberley's six means Seann is safe with nineteen. Rhianna's nineteen hands Lloyd twenty. While Matt's little old three give Desiree a total of nineteen. Unlucky, Lloyd, you lose. - [LLOYD] No. No. No. - [HOSTS, AUDIENCE WHOOPING] [AUDIENCE CHANTING] Flinch, flinch, flinch... It's gonna be okay. Oh, my God. [NARRATOR] So, while Seann and Desiree escort Lloyd for his forfeit, it's time to reveal which of the eight players is Flinch Champion. Of course, it's Sandeep. He wasn't terrified of balloons in Potato Head. He refused to duck under the tractor tyres in Wheely Close. Enjoying the show? And he quite enjoyed the company of three lovely chickens. He beat the game and will live on in Flinch folklore forever. Number one. [ROOSTER CROWING] Ta-da! [LAUGHTER] [DESIREE] I love this. Just the look on your face - is so priceless. - Oh, you lot are here, are you? Oh God. What is going on? - They're gonna go bang. - What? - Yep. - You're gonna flinch. And then you're gonna get whipped by these. [DESIREE] So hard. So hard. - Yeah. - Okay. - No. - We're doing this 'cause we love you. [YELPING] - He flinched. - Seann, do not do that. [YELLING] - Yep. - Mean. Look at the tension. [EXCLAIMS] No, that was not a flinch. - That was so a flinch. - [LLOYD] A scream! - That's a flinch. - You are gonna get it. Flinch. It was very calm. - I did not flinch. - Very calm, but you still flinched. Not a move. [GROANING] It's really impossible not to flinch. - He's doing really well. - Yeah. - I mean, even I flinched. - Wait, was that...? It was not a flinch. [DESIREE] Are we sure? They... The... Yeah, survey says "yes," I'm sorry. - [SEANN] I didn't think you did, but... - You can go... they think you did. [YELLING] Last one, Lloyd. - Yep. - Last one. - Fine. - We're done. - I'm not gonna. - Just getting ready. - I might not flinch. - Just in case. - No. No! - [DESIREE] What did you guys see? - What are you doing? - I love you, I just... [LLOYD] That's not fair. - [LLOYD] No. No. No. - [SEANN] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Stop it. - [DESIREE] One, two, three, go. [SCREAMING FADES AWAY]
