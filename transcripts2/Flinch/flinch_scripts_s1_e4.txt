 You seven are about to be thrown into a series of frightening, thrilling, fear-inducing challenges, all designed to make you flinch. It's really simple. We are randomly gonna choose one of you to represent us in the games. Each time you flinch, you'll be punished with pain, we'll be punished - with points. - And whichever one of us winds up with the most points at the end is going to face our own shame and pain-inducing challenge. See, not complicated at all. The person who flinches the least across all three games will be crowned the winner. Now you all have a spoon with your face on it. And we want you to put those spoons in a bucket. We'll pick one of you to play for us in the games. I'm going first. Nice. Thank you so much. And it is... You. Who is this? Hello. Hi, what is your name? - Fiona. - Hi, Fiona. Where are you from? Kilkenny in Ireland. I'm the public speaking Regional Champion. Um... um... uh... I don't know what else. You've got to be afraid of something, what is it? I don't like vomit. What do you do on St. Patrick's Day? - Stays at home. - Stays indoors, yep. I stay home. Looking forward to seeing what you got, Fiona. Okay, well let's see who's going to be representing me. Who've we got? It's the big man. You should really go to the gym. Hi, I'm Mohamed. I'm a sous-chef and a bodybuilder. - Do you get frightened easily? - Nope. - Is there anything you're afraid of? - Nothing, apart from God. "Nothing apart from..." We got deep. That's serious. If you fail one, it's fine, there won't be a giant flood, you're okay. Can I have my go at a spoon, if that's alright? Always so cheery, aren't you? I have got... this guy! What is your name? My name's Paul. Tell me when to go. - Is that okay? - Yeah, lovely. What do you do for a living? I'm an admin officer and I just like to sing as well. In the office? - Everywhere. - Everywhere? Would you like to sing now? - Yeah, let's go for it. - Nah, we're fine. Lloyd, why don't you get him to sing - one of his answers. - That's pretty good. What are you scared of the most in life? Go! Oh, really. Go and do the challenge. Yes. Good luck to you all. Be brave. No flinching. Fiona, do it. So our magnificent seven head to the other side of the farm for the first challenge. Alright, let's see what we got. - Hot Wax. - Hot wax. - There's a chair. - And some candles. This could get romantic. - Is that my boy? - Yeah. What's his name? - Paul, right? Paul. - Paul, sorry. That is awful, sorry, Paul. What is behind those gates? I've got no idea. Starting to remind me of a date I once had. He's strapped in. If he flinches his legs, he pulls the string. That hot wax is going all over him. It's not gonna be the first time. This is devilish. Alright, this is my girl. The wax is gonna pour out on my legs. You sick people. I do like her. Oh... Are you ready, Paul? Yes. He doesn't seem ready, does he? Hi. Is that feed? Hi. What are you doing? - That is really rude. - Feed on feet. - When your guests come forward... - Guests! And if they do bite... What? What? I didn't even understand his accent. What did you say? It's better that way. No, don't freak out yet. Flinch! That is hot. People. - It's candle wax. - I do declare. - There's my boy. Gonna lose it. - Doing it. He's gonna lose it. No, I can't do this. Take me out, please. Take me out. There's my big beefcake. Why's he scared of a flowerbed? Anything but my feet. I beg you, please. Why, what's wrong with your feet? I'm going to be sick. Flinch. Hello, little boys. He likes it. - He's smiling. - Mohamed is embracing it. - Oh, he's flinching. - Yes, go on, Mohamed. Whether in pleasure or pain, he's flinching. Oh, Seann. It's not great for you, mate. That is such a strange way to react. Stop it, Mohamed. Oh, my gosh. Hello. Is that meant to... "Is that meant to happen"? What the hell is going on? Fire... dangerous. - Yeah. - Yes. Oh, gross. Look at the focus. Ice queen. - I want her. - Oh, yeah. Hello, Mr. Alpaca. Alpaca? Oh, are you wanting my... Ow! Oh, my God, that is a big alpaca. It's not an alpaca. It's famously a goat. Ooh... These are gonna break. Get them away. Goat fight. Ooh! I don't know what the goat was doing to him, but... I think he liked it. On that fragile Irish skin. Yeah. What is he doing? He's a sick man. What animals are they? Oh, my God, it's not an alpaca, is it? No. Oh, it's a goat. No, it's not a goat. What is it? Whoa! Seriously. What is it? A goat? Mm-hmm. I feel stupid. Wow, that was kinky. Yeah. Yeah. - Shall we look at the scores? - Yeah, let's check 'em out. So Mohamed enjoyed that fourteen times. What a man. Paul and Emma did slightly better. Fiona's alpaca made her flinch six times. Jason and Sonia did well. But Kendra kept her cool all the way with a perfect zero. I did maintain a face of steel throughout. Easy. Piece of cake. But how does that affect the hosts? Fiona gives Desiree six flinches. Paul hands Lloyd eleven. And Mohamed's fourteen gets Seann off to the worst start. Yes. - I'm losing. - Yeah. Mohamed let you down? He flinched the most, but he also enjoyed it the most, which was annoying. We need to pick our spoons. And let's see who we've got. Okay, Emma. - Hello. - Hello. Hi, I'm Emma and I'm ready for anything you're gonna throw at me. Just don't ruin my make-up. Anything that makes you flinch? I'm scared of dragonflies. That's about it. I'm confident there are gonna be - no dragonflies in this round. - You never know with this show. - Are you ready for this? - Oh yeah, I'm gonna win it. Brilliant. I trust her. Think I've got a good one. - Yeah. - Thank you. Thank you! I know you, Paul. So, I find you adorable, but you are a screamer. Not just in the bedroom. Yeah, no, not just in the bedroom. So, wherever you have to go to, go to your tough place, alright. - Love you. - Love you too, Paul. Don't fail me. I have got... Sonia. Hi, Sonia. How are you? I'm alright. I'm so ready for this. Let's get it on. I love the way you're smiling so much. 'Cause I'm ready for this. Whatever you're throwing, I'm ready for it. Well, this is great. Sonia, what do you do? - I'm in retail. - What do you sell? Fancy dress. So you work in shops with balloons around? All that, yeah. Everything going on, yeah. - If they go off, do you flinch? - No. I don't do no flinching. No, absolutely not. Guys, go on to your next challenge and don't let us down. Do Not Hurl! Sounds sick. So Irish hurling balls and sticks. What is hurling? Is it like baseball? Do you know hockey? - Yes. - Like drunk hockey. That's already hockey. No, you've seen nothing. Oh, there are rat traps on the bed. Come on, Emma. There's no dragonflies, that's good. Platform. Let your feet hang off the edge of that. - She looks good in carpet. - Yeah. Like this? They're literally walking the plank. What a helmet. And I'm gonna help you up the steps. You're okay. What is this? Come on, Paul, you know. - Are those mouse traps? - Yes, they are. Oh my goodness. Emma, you look ready. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. She ain't ready. Oh no. I hope these guys are accurate. Oh, my God, what you gonna do? You're not gonna hit me, are you? She said she was not gonna fail me. Oh, my God. You're actually kidding me. What? I'm wearing carpet, not armour. Is this safe? I'd have asked that before we'd signed any papers. Why are they holding a flush? I think if they pull that, they go down. I reckon it's in case they poop poop themselves. Ooh! Flinch! Who's not gonna flinch at that? I've pooped myself. Timber! That is awful, mate. Oh, no! Oh, my God. It's gonna freak me out. I am gonna fall. No, she's not. She's a lovely woman. Flinch! Have I got to do that again? Yep, get up and walk the plank again. Steady, Emma, steady. Be brave. Nope. Yes! Got her. Unbelievable. Oh my God, it got me on the bum. Come on, Paul. I'm a heavy breather, so it might look like I'm flinching, but I'm not. - Wow. - Yeah. My little soldier. This round does not go with those shoes. Alright, taking it in. Oh, no. They're not...? I don't wanna get hit. It's gonna happen. Play nice, boys. Don't, don't! How do you sleep at night? "How do you sleep at night?" Nice. He's gone back... and then forward. I didn't flinch that time. I did not flinch. I did good. - You've done well there. - We should probably... Look at the scores and find out how they did. Mohamed loses again with seven flinches. Followed by Fiona, Emma, Jason. Then Sonia and Kendra. Making Paul the unlikely winner of this game with three flinches. I was good at that challenge. I was good. Bit shaken up, but I'll be alright. Paul brings Desiree to nine. Sonia takes Lloyd to fifteen. While Emma raises Seann to nineteen, and he faces the forfeit. Yes! Yes. Seann! That is amazing. I don't wanna have to do... We still have another game, anything could happen. Shall we get the spoons in for one last time? Yeah. Hello, Jason. Hello. I'm Jason John Keller, and I'm just out here killing it. Which side is my better side? I think it's this one. Or this one? I like this one. Tell me something about you. Like, do have any special skills? I've got nice eyebrows. - True. - Good smile. That's a good skill. I've got good fashion. So basically you look great, but are you afraid of anything? Honey, I'm not afraid... well, actually I am, I lie. Everyone in the background's nodding. Stay beautiful. - Don't go down. - Honey, I've got this. - I've got this for you. - Alright, I believe in you. Look who I've got. - Paul. - You are working it today, Paul. You did okay last time. But you're playing for me now, Paul. Don't flinch. I'm gonna defend you. I'm in for the win. And I'm ready. Can you say it with a bit less enthusiasm, is that alright? I'm in for the win. Cheers, buddy. Sit down. - Sonia. - Sonia! Ask and you shall receive. This is a fix. Happy Sonia. I'm your girl, you know. I'm your girl. You are my girl. Yes, look at the dancing. Just keep that positivity. Keep going. Go and do the final challenge. Good luck to all of you. I think you might be in a bit of luck, and I might not be. But I'm down by quite a bit. - Yeah but... - I don't wanna do a challenge. Electric Dining. Train track. That creepy chair again. Ginger men. - Two ginger men. - Pegs on their nose. - Lloyd, have you let one off? - No. The guys that look after the challenges are animals. If they've got pegs on their noses, you know that this is not ideal. Just bubbly, bubbly Sonia. Come on, bubbly Sonia. There's a clothes peg on my nose, but I can still smell something really bad. Paul, come on, mate. I'm actually really nervous about this. There's a cattle prod. - There's electricity. - A cattle prod. It smells quite bad. He's going to be shocked and appalled. Come on, Paul, hold it together. - He's gagging. - He's already hurling. - Nothing's happened. - Oh, no. That is so foul. There are maggots in it. - Oh, no. - Okay. I mean, she's not, but Sonia are you ready? I'm ready. Yeah. Here we go. It's between me and you, Lloyd, - 'cause I think Desiree has this. - Yeah. Oh, look at that. A little choo-choo train. "A choo-choo train." Oh God, he's gonna puke. Oh no, it's coming. I'm doing a challenge. Unlucky, Lloyd. This is a fix. Oh no, there's something crawling on the meat. This is disgusting. So that's a flinch. Oh no! No. No, Paul. Ah, it stinks. - Jason, don't let me down. - That is sick. Uh, one fell on me. One fell on me. I knew it. I knew it. Sonia's flinching. Come on, Sonia. Wafting it in my face. Nasty. Lloyd, look at your guy. Yes, is that cheese? 'Cause that doesn't seem so bad. Yeah, but one of the world's smelliest. Oh, I'm gonna get a double waft, aren't I? - Yeah. - Oh God. Oh, man. Mohamed is a chef and even he can't stand it. That's nasty. - Guess he's not a maggots chef. - Maggots chef! Oh, it's brain. - Is it brain? - It's Stinking Bishop. Looks like cheese shoved with brain. Why would she go to brain first? What is that? It's that, like, Asian fruit that smells like vomit. Come on, mate. Don't be cheating, holding your breath. You're enjoying this too much. You don't electrocute someone who's throwing up. What is wrong with this world? Lloyd, is there even a bit of you enjoying this? No. That's the worst one. Yeah that's alright, that's alright. Sonia's smashed it. You can't put more carriages on there. Surely. Surstromming. Oh, my God. Oh, I don't know... is that a dead bird? No, Emma. It's fermented Swedish fish. Oh, what is that... Oh, my God. Sit up straight for us, Paul. I can't, that's disgusting. Get a good whiff. You can't electrocute him. - He's being sick. - This is the worst. You're an animal, mate. - I love her. - Yeah. She's joyous. Nothing will make her unhappy. Nothing. - Bye bye, Lloyd. - Bye bye, Lloyd. Think I've a weak stomach. Okay, let's take a look at the scores. What is the point? So Paul's retching makes him the worst flincher on fifteen. Mohamed flinched ten times. Emma and Kendra are not far behind. Jason and Fiona do better. Which means the mighty Sonia wins with just five flinches. - Whoa! - Whoa! What does that mean? What did I have? - Oh come on, please. - It's me, isn't it? Jason gives Desiree a grand total of seventeen. Sonia's great work means Seann's total is twenty-four. And Paul's fifteen means Lloyd finishes on thirty, and will face the Flinch Forfeit. Yes! - Flinch, flinch, flinch! - Yes! Yes! So while Lloyd is led to his forfeit, time to reveal which of the seven players is Flinch Champion. And it's everybody's favorite fancy dress queen, Sonia. She was cool as ice on Hot Wax. Feels quite nice, actually. Laughed in the face of flying balls in Do Not Hurl. And in Electric Dining, sniffed her way to victory, and immortality. No more. How you feeling, Lloyd? - Yeah, great. - You wanna see? I mean, you don't but... Come on. Here we go. - Oh, no! Oh, no! - Nice. - There we go. - What are my fingers on? What are my fingers on? Look at me. Lloyd, do you like cheese? - Love it. - You can have a bit of cheese if you want. There you go. For Lloydy boy. You know what, I don't know that the cheese thing works. I think that's only stuff for cartoons. Can you just itch my nose? Desiree, Lloyd wants his nose itching, could you help him out? - Got it. - No! Just help him out. - No. No. No. - I got your nose, it's okay! - There you go. - This is degrading. - Let's go and meet your friends. - Friends? Oh, no. Sweetums, baby. Oh, you can do mine. You can do mine. Alright, John, can you get the door? - There you go. - Okay. - Here you go. - Oh, my God. There you go, baby. There you go. There you go. There's one. - There we go. - Look at his hands. I'm more scared of this game than Lloyd is. - Look at his eyes. - Look at his face. Look how terrified he is. That's a flinch. Oh, that really hurts. Man up! - Good luck, bro. - Can you two get back here? Bye, Lloyd. Oh, I think one of the rats has peed on my head. Not even joking. Oh no, you... You can...
