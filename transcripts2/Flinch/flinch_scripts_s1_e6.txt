 Come on in. Let's have some fun. Welcome to Flinch. You eight players are about to be thrown into a variety of disturbing, dangerous and often shocking challenges designed specifically to make you flinch. Okay, pay attention. It gets complicated. The person who flinches the least over three unnerving games will be crowned the winner. Now, you're each holding a spoon with your face on it. And you're going to place them into this bucket. And we'll each pick one of you to play for us in the games. Right, pay attention. Each time you flinch, we'll instantly get points. Unfortunately for us, the one with the most points at the end of the show will face our own flinch forfeit. Go on, Seann. Ooh! I've found Wally. Hello, I'm Monty. I'm a student from Essex. And I'm here to have a bit of fun on the farm. Bring it on. What about fears? - Swans. - Wow. You're the poshest man I've ever met. - Good luck. - Thank you. Okay, my turn. Thank you. Hello. So what's your name? Hope. Hope, good. Should I have some? We could be hopeless, I don't know. I'm 21. I live in Norfolk. I wanna prove I'm not a chicken. I love her. I think this is gonna be great. Thank you so much, Hope. Hello, you alright? Hello, mate. My name's Michael, I'm here to have great time. - How often do you go to the gym? - Everyday. Everyday? I actually go more than that. - What do you do for a living? - Stuntman. - You're a stuntman? - Yeah. That is cheating. Well, I've won. Right, guys, let's get on with the show. Get out of here. - I believe, Hope. I believe. - Woo-hoo! So off frolic the eight, on their way to the other side of the farm toward the Shed of Pain, as it's now known. Shall we see the first game? Yes, please. Shock In A Box. - Step up. - Step up. My man, Michael. Don't be pulling any stunts on me, pal. Shouldn't he be, like, somersaulting into that? - He has to hold on to these. - Yeah. And they're electrified by car batteries. - He looks slightly worried now. - Yeah, he does. Which has me worried now. Monty, young chap. Don't be too worried. Oh no! No, no, no, no, no! Come on arms. We've got this. We can do it. My girl. What is in this box? Michael, are you ready? I am ready. And this is not good. - He's got company. - Oh, boy. Who or what is that? It's a little boy. Little but sinister. That kid is the scariest challenge I've ever seen. Hi. Oh, my God, you're so cute. But please don't hurt me. Why are you smiling? Go away. I hate Jack-in-the-boxes. Flinch! Yep, yep. No, it's not funny. Don't laugh. Michael, you're a stuntman, so stuntman up! - What is going on? - He's loving it. You absolute fool. Fu... He can't hear you swearing! But he can see you. Ow! Stop it. Don't you do it. Never seen someone squeal but smile at the same time. - It's not funny. - No, don't. Stop, you don't have to do it. - Are you enjoying this? - Yeah. Yeah? He looks like he's absolutely loving it. Oh, you got me that time. Oh! - First no-flinch of the game. - Damn. Ah! Woo, boys. Keep going. Faster. Monty, what you doing? Alex the barista's had far too many espressos. He loves it. It's taking a while. Don't laugh, it's not funny. What a wicked young man. - What a hero. - He's going back to his trailer now. - That was terrifying. - It was absolutely terrifying. - Didn't go as well for me as I thought. - No, no it didn't. Monty doesn't like swans, children or boxes, eight flinches. He's followed by Hope, Aqua and Michael. Alex and Lauren and Joe did better. But Meg didn't Jack-in-the-box at all, with the perfect zero. Michael hits Lloyd with five. Hope gives Desiree six. But Monty shocks Seann with eight. Oh! Not feeling too bad about it, actually. Let's get the jug in, and onto the next round. Hello. Hiya, darling. Hello. Hi, I'm Lauren I'm a child entertainer. Literally a princess. I love adventure. And I love challenges. Um... Do I have to keep going? So we've already learned a lot about the piercing sound of your scream. - Yeah. - It is intense, like window shattering. What is your happy place? My happy place is actually at home just with my mum and dad and no one else. That is what a princess would say, though. Well done. Just do it for me. - I'll do that. I will do that. - Thank you so much. Okay, my turn. Hello, sir. Yes. Oh my. He is so ready. Oh, my God. Hello, I'm Alex. I like a bit of a challenge. I'm ready for anything. Come on. What do you do, you nutter? I'm a barista. Okay, do you have any fears, apart from being alive? Nothing really. Nothing really scares me, anything like that. You're not scared of anything? Not that I'm aware of. That's great. I think you're actually gonna enjoy it. Go and enjoy yourself. What a legend. Yeah, right. He's great. I think you picked a good one. I have got... you, Meg. Hi, I'm Meg. I'm 23 years old, and I'm a Canadian artist living in London. I'm not too sure why I'm here, but I'm a bit of a badass. So I think I'll be alright. Do you have any fears or anything? Needles. What are those on your arm? Got a lot of tattoos there. Tattoos are quite painful. Kind of like the pain. - That's good. - That is good, yeah. That is good. Yeah, that's fine. I'm happy. Get out and get on with the challenge. - Shall we see what the game is? - Let's do it. - Flour Burst. - Flour Burst! Oh no. - She is not happy. - She is very angry. What are those? Are those like fireworks? I think they're pipes. I think those make, like, train whistle sounds. - Oh really? - Yeah. Well, that dude with the levers, he seems connected to them. Those are big bags of flour. Are they baking? I think have worked this one out. I might know what's gonna happen. I really hope that I don't go face first into this. You won't if you don't flinch, so don't flinch! Look at his face. - That was excited, not scared. - Brilliant. I'm freaking out a little bit. Meg, are you ready? No. Oh, God. Oh... Meg, hold your nerve, please. That's a face flinch. Definite grimace there, and it's a full body-slam onto the flour. Let's see. - Alex, turning around is flinching. - Flinch! Lauren's loving this. The flinching too, sorry to say. Oh no. She likes it too much. Flinch. Down you go, Monty boy. He's a cartoon. Oh now, Aqua's at it too. This is a tricky challenge. Michael's stunting it out. - Oh, brave now. - There he is. Subtle flinch, Joe. You're going down. Look at his face. That gets everywhere. That's not a flinch. Yes, Meg. Get in! That's it, Lauren. Take a dip for Desiree. That is just mean. At least it's muffling the scream. Michael, not a bit of flour on him. He has mastered it. Wow! Flinch. This is evil. Stop. Too much. - That was great. - Oh, my God. - Fantastic. - Might be one of my favorite games. - Yeah. - It's like the end of Scarface. Alright, I think we need to look at those scores. I don't wanna look at the scores. Alright, I'll just tell you you're losing. Alex, Lauren and Monty all top the charts with five flinches. Followed by Aqua, then it's Hope. Meg and Joe flinched twice. But it's Michael who finally shows his stunt credentials with zero flinches. My ear is still ringing. Oh, God. Not as terrible as it could have been, but obviously... I'll take that, I will absolutely take that. - Of couse you will. Of course. - Let's have a look at the loser board. Meg's little two brings Lloyd up to seven. Lauren's five gives Desiree eleven. And Alex's five means Seann moves closer to the forfeit with thirteen. Bee-boop! I am very worried. Shall we pick for the final? - Yeah. - Yes, let's do it. Hey! Mate, coffees all around. Right, my turn. Well, I've got Aqua. Hey, darling. Hello. How are you? I'm alright. Hi, my name's Aqua. I'm 21, from Northern Ireland. Don't think there's anything much that could scare me. Do you have any strategy going into the next challenge? I am going to think of my little baby Lily, you know, just staring at me and I'll be like... Yeah. Alright, so you have a reason to succeed. Do it for her and then I will reap the benefits. Exactly, yeah. Amazing. You are so dope, Aqua. Go in there and own this thing. - Thank you so much. - I will just for you. Thank you. Thank you. She might be your last. I really need you to focus here, and not flinch. - Try my hardest. I promise. - Thank you. - Oh, are you nervous? - I've got a bad feeling about this. Right, well, enough chatting, boys and girls, get on with it. So this won't be good clean fun then. There's your last hope, Seann. She wasn't great for me. This is so much trust. Come on, Hope, please. Standard skip-and-chair combo. What the...? What is this? Said every player ever. - This look like a bad one. - This looks awful. Oh my... What is that? What is that? - Are you gonna shoot stuff at me? - They're bird-scarers. Basically, a loud bang to keep the birds off the crops. Definitely a little bit exciting. Just gonna end up flying forward and getting wet, I think. He's worked it out. Oh, my God, my head's getting taped down. - Please keep smiling. - I don't like it. Hope... I'm very worried for you. This looks terrifying. - Are you ready? - No. What? Basically, they get dunked if they flinch. Into the dirty waterfall. Wow, Meg looks terrified this time. What is this about, man? I'm so worried. That is disgusting! Oh, my God. I got it in my mouth. I don't know why I'm laughing. Time to get wet, Alex. And it's points for you, Lloyd. Nothing like a dirty shower to wake you up. Bit cold, that. Oh... Oh, no, no, no, no, no. What is that stuff? It's awful. No. I mean, that looks freezing. What the...? All over. Thank you, mate. Rahtid! A stuntman should be used to this. No, that's not even funny. That's seriously not even funny. Ooh... I mean, is this even legal? Only in Ireland. It went in my mouth. Going again? Yes, mate. Oh, well that's... Oh, oh. Oh, she's gonna hurl! Quite fun, actually, this. Can I get out now? - I mean... - Look at your stupid smiling face. It's tight. It's gonna be tight. I'm feeling a bit confident. Oh, we best look at them scores. Aqua, Hope and Meg all flinched five times. Then it's Joe. Followed by Michael, Laura and Monty who flinched four times. But Alex finally comes good to win this challenge with just three flinches. So I think we know what that makes the loser board look like. So which one of our lovely hosts faces the forfeit? Alex keeps Lloyd safe with a total of ten. Aqua brings Desiree up to sixteen. And Hope hands Seann a total of eighteen. You lose, Seann. Get in! - Seann Walsh! - Yes! Yes. - Stand up, mate. Stand up. - Off you go! Flinch, flinch, flinch. Love them! You're about to get it, kid. So while Seann is led to his forfeit, time to reveal which player is crowned. Flinch Champion. And it's mighty Meg. She refused to be shocked by a Jack-in-the-box. She got a light dusting in Flour Burst. And got pretty wet in Dirty Waterfall. But it was still enough for her to go down in the annals of Flinch glory! Basically, these are emus... - Oh my God. - Which have not been fed for a few days. So we're just gonna feed them. Well, I say "we." You're gonna feed them. Look at the size of them. And, obviously if you do flinch... There are consequences. Got a couple of lorry batteries, and we'll electrocute the trolley. - You happy? - No! You'll be fine, don't flinch. Oh, my God. That's the... oh, God. Now, that's happening. Oh, my God, look at them. That definitely counts. That's a flinch. This is horrible. Never seen them go after dinner like this. That's a flinch. Oh, no. I think that one likes you. She really has a thing for you, Seann. I hate emus!
