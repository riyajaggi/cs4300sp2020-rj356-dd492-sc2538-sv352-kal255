 After burying their friend, Miles, Charlie and the others continue their quest to rescue Danny. They learn that Monroe now has a working train and Miles is certain Danny will be transported to Philadelphia. Nora contacts a fellow member of the militia and she decides to blow up the train, even if it puts Danny's life in danger. Danny meanwhile is having a hard time with Captain Tom Neville. In flashbacks, Neville's life at the time of the blackout is revealed. He is clearly prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect his wife and son. In Philadelphia, Rachel tells Monroe about the pendants.

 We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. Previously on Revolution: - I gotta go get Nora. - Who is this woman?

 She's really good at blowing stuff up. - Joined the rebels? - What rebels? - Bunch of bleeding heart... - Patriots. Captain Tom Neville. Know him? - He was here. - He have a prisoner with him? A boy. Nineteen. Blond hair. - And you saw him when? - Yesterday. Danny's close. We can maybe catch up by tomorrow. You're joking. - How long you been following us? - Long enough. Just noticed? - You must be getting old. - He's a spy. I'm sorry. But you're important, kid. More important than you even know. - How is she? - You saved me, Charlie. That's right. We're here to save you. Maggie, please don't go. Maggie...

 - Ugh! - Oh, nice. - How you feel? - Ugh. You got some more? Aw. Come on, who's next? Danny boy. You're up. - No... No, thanks. - Come on. These boot-licks are too afraid to hit hard. But I know how you feel about me. I'm not gonna fight you. You gotta toughen up, son. Attaboy. Attaboy. [BOTH GRUNTING AND MEN SHOUTING Can you explain that? - The Connolly family. Fire claim. - Uh-huh. - And the property damage? - That was... Well... How many times have we had a conversation like this? They're not covered for smoke damage, so we don't pay for smoke damage. You're fired. All right, come on. Just give them a minute. I just gave them 30. That's plenty. It's time to go. Miles, stop it. We've lost too much time already. We just buried Maggie, so please let us say goodbye. Good bye? To who? That's just a body in the ground, Charlie. But, Danny, he's still alive. And he's close. And if you want him back, you can't do this. You don't have the luxury. But hanging around here crying... ...it's not gonna help. Let's move. I'm sorry about Maggie. What was that? Oh, you gotta be kidding me. If Monroe has got a train, it's bad, Charlie. It could be real bad. - What do you mean, "a few snags"? - This should be in a museum, not on tracks. Tracks, by the way, they're working day and night to clear. Prying every busted car off between here and Philadelphia. The train is due to leave first thing tomorrow. Yes? So if I were you, quit making excuses and make my deadline. - Yes, sir. - See you bright and early. Yeah. All right, you heard the man. Let's move it! Your son is boarding the train... ...and he'll be here soon. Rachel, come on. This is good news. How is this good news? Well, you can be with your boy again, and you can be happy again. Bass... ...please. We used to be friends. If that means anything to you... ...let Danny go. You have me. I'll tell you everything. I know. I know you will. And you know how I know? Because I'm gonna have your son here with me. You're a son of a bitch. I gave you a lot of chances to cooperate. I'm sorry it's come to this. @ https://thepiratebay.se/user/Zen_Bud  What're you standing around for, lady? This train is leaving first thing in the morning. And Monroe, with a working train... ...makes him dangerous, Miles, even more so than usual. I know. We got other problems right now. - So? - Train leaves tomorrow. Let me guess, going to Philly, right? They're putting Danny on that train, I guarantee it. How about you, militia boy? You know about any of this? Yeah. Danny's here somewhere. If we don't find him by morning, he's gone. We should check if he's on the train. And outside that, they're probably holding him in a cell somewhere. That's what I'd do. So we check the old station house. Could be a walk-in freezer, meat locker. I don't know. Anything secure. No. No crossbows, no swords. We gotta keep a low profile. You, guard Nipples. He even tries to move, go ahead and shoot him. We split up, we canvass the town. You even catch a scent of Danny, walk away. Come find me. We only get one shot at this. You probably don't remember banks. It was strange. I used to work my fingers to the bone... ...for money. Ah. Never even saw what I made. - Yeah, I'll tell you something else. - Shut up already. What did you say to me? I'm sick of it. I'm sick of your weird speeches. Your mind games. Whatever you're trying to do, it's not working. I would be very... ...very careful, if I were you. Or what? Are you gonna hit me again? Does that make you feel tough, beating up an 18-year-old kid? What's that say about you? Hey, there, Rob. You think that maybe you could keep your music down at night? It keeps my son awake. - Daddy. - Hey. Hey, Optimus. How you guys doing? - Good, Daddy. - Good. - Hey. - Hey, how was work? Oh, good. You know, just fine. Hey, uh, have I got some time before dinner? Yeah, a little bit. Why? Hey, Jason. How long you been there? - You wanna take a swing? - Can I? Sure. Come on. Okay. Hands up. Now, just remember... ...we only hit the bag, we never hit people. Honey? Did the power go out? - Hi. - Hello. Can I help you with something? Yeah. A friend told me about this place. I'm looking for a biography of Joe Biden. I just need to be sure. Okay. Now show me yours. Nora Clayton. Hutch. Ken Hutchinson. So how many men you got around here, Hutch? Well, uh, you are looking at the entirety of Noblesville underground. - You're joking. - No. The militia wiped out our whole unit. My wife along with them. It's just me now. No, it's you and me. And we're gonna blow up that train. Excuse me, young lady. If you don't mind me asking, what are you doing? Because it looks like you're casing the joint. I'm spying. Um, it's my boyfriend. No, don't look. Here. I think he might be cheating on me. What's your name? Sara McGill. Captain Tom Neville. It's very nice to meet you, Captain Neville. Are you here for the train? How'd you guess that? Well... ...I mean, everyone's here for the train, right? I suppose so. You have a nice afternoon. And if I may... ...that boy's a fool if he's two-timing you. You take care now. Think I can't spot a tail? Especially one as clumsy as yours. Who are you? Okay, suit yourself. Unh! Get out of here! I should have guessed. Okay, then. So is this the sister? Quite the family resemblance. - She looks like Danny. - I said go! Miles. Tom. How's the wife? Julia's good. I haven't seen her in about a year of course. Yeah, I've been out looking for you. But we write. Her azaleas are in bloom. - How's my nephew? - Oh, he's a spirited young man. Where is he? Oh, like that's just what I'm gonna do, Miles. Spread my legs and show you everything. Okay, how about a trade? Danny, for one of your guys. - You got one of my guys? - Yeah. The one who's been tailing us... ...the, uh, short hair, shirt too tight. You can keep him. - I'll kill him, Tom. You know I will. - You do what you gotta do. I got new orders. I need Danny. Hell, maybe more than I need you. Look, while we're talking... ...I wanna ask you something. Why'd you leave? You wouldn't understand. Hey! - I gotta go, Tom. - But you just got here. Can I have that back? That's an ugly necklace, my man. Yeah. It was my wife's. Oh, God. Nora. Uh... Uh... Who is this? Hutch. - You two know each other? - He's resistance. Oh, so you have, like, what, a secret handshake or something? Nora. Nora, what is going on? Nora? Nor... Hutch, can you give us a minute? Aaron. You gotta warn Miles. I'm putting a bomb on that train. - Well, what about Danny? - This is more important. More important? There's gonna be dozens of officers on board. So I have to blow it up so a bunch of those bastards go down. And what if Danny is on board too? What happens then? Miles will find him first. Miles has to find him first. Hey. What did I tell you? What did I say? Did I say not get close? Do not get close. He bumped into me. You followed him. You were over your head. You have no idea how dangerous he is. Okay, I get it, I screwed up. But it's Neville. - He has Danny. I just... - You got emotional! And you panicked, and you blew it. Surprise was the only thing we had going, and you pissed it away. This was already hard. You just made it impossible. If we don't get Danny back, you got nobody to blame but yourself. Why are you...? You never used to be like this. How do you know? Because I remember you. It hit me the other day. I was about 4. And you came for a visit. And you took me for a ride in your car. You had one of those... One of those tape decks. And you were singing at the top of your lungs, and I remember laughing. What happened to that guy? He's dead. - Sir, it's all taken care of. - Good. Don't touch me. Where are we going? - A more secure location. - Sir, we gotta go. What happened out there? If I didn't know any better... ...I'd say that you look a little nervous. Do I need to repeat myself? I think we have to go. Just on foot? Just walk out of here? There are looters, people shooting each other for a bag of chips. It's dangerous. Well, what makes you think it's not too dangerous to stay? - No, baby, no... - No, no, no. You just stay here. Stay here. - Rob? - Walk away, Tom. This is my house. You're my neighbor. - Daddy? - Jason, go back to bed. You too, Tom, before I beat you in front of your son. Daddy. Torn! She's gonna blow up the train? What if Danny's on board? - She said she didn't have a choice. - We have to stop her. You won't be able to find her. What we need to do is find Danny, if we can. If you know anything about where they're keeping my brother, you have to tell me. This is my family. I'm asking, I'm begging you, please, tell me. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Well, then I can't help you either. Damn it. The Georgia Federation formed an alliance with the Plains Nation... ...amassing troops along our borders to the south and west. The skirmish has flared up here, just outside of St. Louis. We lost a few hundred men. So where did those sons of bitches get the stones all of a sudden? We assume they heard about our rebel problems. They think we can't keep our house in order. They see a chance to exploit weakness. - Sorry, sir, I didn't mean to imply... - Quit apologizing, John. Give me one Black Hawk chopper. Just one. What would they do then, huh? Throw stones at it? No. No, they'd kneel and bow, just like the Mayans before the Spanish. And I'll still cut their guts out. By the time we're done here, John, North America is ours. Sky is the limit. The problem with bombs these days is the ignition. Electric charges are impossible, fuses are unreliable. But this... ...the train is on the move, the log gets tossed into the furnace... ...and they ignite it for us. Bang. It couldn't have been easy setting up that first one. Knowing what it was gonna do. Doesn't get any easier. You just get better at swallowing it. My wife, she was the fighter. Me, I was happy burying myself in my books. But doing something like this... ...I think she'd be proud. Yeah, she'd be proud. Can't believe I didn't think of this before. A bank vault. The perfect place to keep Danny. It's just that 24 hours was a stretch. And you want us to leave now? I mean, who knows if she'll even make it. Then you'll push her into Philadelphia yourself. - Clear? - Clear. Captain. Matheson's gonna be here, so why are we running away? When did you say it was leaving? First thing tomorrow. That's Captain Neville. If Neville is on that train, then that kid has to be Danny. - Damn it. - What? What's wrong? - I can't do this. I gotta get that bomb off. - What? I made a promise. And this kid, if he dies... Hutch, this one, I can't swallow. Nora. You were right. We have to do this. I know I said I could. - But now I just... I can't do it. - I have to do it. I have to do it for my wife. She died for this. Hutch, get out of my... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop it. Nora? - Who did this to you? - Listen. The bomb is on the train. And so is your brother. The bomb is a hollowed-out log. It's in front of the tender car, Miles. I'm sorry. Charlie. I'll get the bomb, you go find Danny. Charlie. Danny! Come on. Let's go. No! Let me go! Let me go! You bring the girl to me. Bring her to me. I'm gonna shoot the bitch. That's an order. - Now. - Shield your head. I told you to bring me the girl. - You gonna be all right? - I'm doing better. Didn't hit anything too important. - Miles, if you hadn't gotten that bomb... - But I did. That uncle you knew when you were little... ...he's not dead. I just, um... I can't be him right now... ...because I'm gonna have to kill Monroe. I'm gonna have to walk to Philly and kill my best friend. I get it, Miles. But honestly, I don't wanna hear it. You were right. Sitting here moping... ...it won't help get us Danny back and it probably will get us killed. So, Philadelphia. Aaron, you coming? Yes, I'm coming. Nora, you in, or you gonna try to kill my brother again? I'm in. Good. Miles, you? All right, let's get going. We got a lot of ground to cover. Nice job, coach. Jason. Hello, Mother. It's good to be home. I'm gonna teach you how to use this. Gun too, when the time comes. Dad, I'm scared. I love you, Jason. But we have to toughen up. If we're scared, if we're weak, then we're dead. Do you understand me? He's hurt. What did they do to him? From now on, no one will touch him, Rachel. And you can see him any time you want. As long as I tell you whatever you want. Well, if I help you, then you help me. Rachel. For the last time... ...what was Ben working on? We were both working on it. We worked together. I don't have all the specs... ...but if you want to turn the power back on... ...it starts with these pendants. There are 12 of them.
