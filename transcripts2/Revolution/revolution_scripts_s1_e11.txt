 You wanna see him again, we're gonna go against Monroe and his men. I gotta go get Nora. You joined the rebels? Bring back the United States. You following us? Who knows what he told Monroe. He's a spy, Charlie. Your son, how do I know where his loyalties lie? You have my word. I'll keep him in line. Let Danny go. I'll tell you everything. If you wanna turn the power back on, it starts with these pendants. It's an amplifier. It slips on tanks, weapons. - You were in charge of the whole Militia? - Yeah. I trained them. - Come back, I'll let your family live. - I'm sorry I didn't kill you the first time. - Charlie? - Mom? We're gonna find a way out. We're gonna get your son.

 Danny? Go! In here. They're gonna look for the bodies. We gotta go. - Where? - As far away from Philly as we can get. Sir? They've searched everywhere. They didn't find any remains. Is it possible there weren't any remains to find? It's possible. But it's also Miles, so... Right. Miles. Who you let slip right past you back at the prison. And escape with all his friends. He took advantage of you, Tom. That is a troubling weakness. I'm sorry, sir. Don't worry yourself. Miles doesn't matter. We have light, power. We have everything. It's time to let everyone know. Starting with the rebels. You find me every rebel camp in the republic. Every one. We send in the choppers, wipe them from Earth. And once that irritation is done... ...it's on to Georgia. Then the Plains Nation. Then California. It's all gonna be the Monroe Republic, sea to shining sea. Yes, sir. And, Tom? If you do find Miles and he's alive? Kill him. - Cargo? - Coming from the city morgue. - Let's take a look. - Buddy, they're just corpses. We're on lockdown. Checking everything coming out of Philly. - Why? What's going on? - Escaped fugitives. We're looking for a couple of men. Some women too. Uh-huh. Look, we're just trying to do our job. Me too. Open them up. That one. Smell's killer, huh? So, Rachel, turns out you're not the mild mannered housewife I thought you were. We've been through a lot, Aaron. Not now, all right? I'm sorry, it's just that you're alive, which is, you know, newsworthy. You knew about the necklaces and the blackout. - Aaron. - Rachel. Ben gave me that necklace. It drove me nuts. it almost got us all killed. - I deserve an explanation. - We all do. I know. And I will explain everything, all right? It's complicated. Under the trees! Where are they going? West Chester's that way. There's a rebel camp in West Chester. Militia's moving rifles up here and here, along I-76. If we hit hard and fast-- Do you hear that? Oh, my-- @ https://thepiratebay.se/user/Zen_Bud  - Is anybody alive? - No. I've never seen anything like this. This is what war used to look like before the blackout. - Miles, I gotta go. - Go where? - Central Command. - What's Central Command? Rebel headquarters in Annapolis. I gotta tell them about this. - I'm coming with you. - Yeah. I am too. What? No. No way. They hit this, they hit the rest. We have to warn them. I hung in there, okay? Through some very bad times. But we did it, we found Danny. So, please, let's just go home. What home? Sooner or later, Monroe will find us. There's no home to go back to. - Then we leave the Monroe Republic. - It's all going to be the Monroe Republic. - Rachel-- - I gave Monroe the amplifier. He has the helicopters because of me. All of this is because of me. - If it's not up to me to stop him then who? - Hey. But it's too late. How's anybody gonna win this? With muskets and Crossbows? Then we get some bigger guns. Yeah. How? What if I was able to get the rebels missile launchers? Thermal-guided. Surface to air. Rachel, firepower like that takes imaging systems, tracking chips. It takes power. Monroe has power. Let's get some of our own. There's a guy I used to work with not far from here. He can help us. And this coworker of yours has electricity? Oh, I get it. You can't explain and it's complicated. You know I'm coming with you, right? Somebody's gotta keep you in one piece. And that's you? You're the one who's gonna make sure that nothing bad happens to me? Well, it's not a discussion, Rachel. You guys see the choppers coming, you run. You understand? Get out of sight. I'm proud of you. Both of you. I'll see you soon. Just come back this time, okay? I promise. It's okay. I'm gonna be here when you wake up. I'm not going anywhere, I promise. I love you, Danny. I love you to the moon and back. I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't do this. No one's ever done this procedure before, no one's even tested it. - He's not a science project. - You're right. He's our son. And nothing else has worked. This is what's left, okay? She'll be back. That was a slaughter. I prefer "decisive." - There were families in there, sir. - Which is a tragedy. But you tell me, what kind of enemy hides behind their women and children? So let's have a little chat... ...about where the closest rebel camp is. Um, Nora? I, uh, think we found your rebel base. I do not believe it. Nicholas. What are you doing here? Nora. You're a sight for sore eyes. - Charlie, right? - Yeah. - Meet Commander Ramsey. - It's an honor, sir. I don't know about that. I'm not commander of much anymore. Yeah, and I was with the unit in Rockville when they came and caught us by surprise. Never thought I'd see anything like that. - Saw them take out West Chester. - Taking us all out. It's a full-on extermination. - So, what's the plan? - Plan? This resistance, it's over for good. What if we can help? - And how are you gonna do that? - We won't, Miles Matheson will. Are we ever gonna talk about... ...you know... ...this? There's nothing to talk about. Rachel, I saw a body. It was you. You gotta know that I would never, ever have left... ...if I thought you were alive. All this time with Bass... ...he hurt you? Hey. Everything that happened... ...it's all my fault. All of it. And I will never be able to make it up to you. And I'm sorry. Step back. Please. Will you look at that? The Lord works in mysterious ways. Come on. Call in the air strike. Is there a problem? We can't do this. Excuse me? There are too many people in there. Is it really about the people? And not just one person in particular? That pert little bitch has got you soft as a kitten. Need I remind you... ...we are at war with these rebels. With those choppers, we're not fighting. We're butchering. I didn't sign on for this. You don't get to choose what you sign on for. You follow orders. Not this time. Dad? You are a shameful disappointment to me. Don't ever come home again. Rachel? Is that really you? Hey, John. It's been a long time. Yeah, yeah. Come in, come in. Where have you been? Philadelphia. Monroe's been keeping me a prisoner. Well, why? Why, what happened? It's a long story. Um, who's he? Who are you? I'm a friend. Yeah? Okay. I'm just really glad to see you. I thought for sure you were dead. - Have you spoken to anyone else? - No, nobody. It's been radio silence. Really? - What about Grace? - No. And she won't answer her computer. Nobody will. You know, it's like they all just vanished. - Why? - I don't know. Okay. John, we have other problems. Monroe has an amplifier. What? How did he get it? From me. - From you? - I made a mistake. I need to fix it. I need your help. Charlie. I'm not gonna hurt you. You mean you're not gonna throw me off a train again? Jason. - What? - It's my real name. Jason Neville. Neville? Like Major Neville? He's my father. He spotted you and your camp. And now he's riding back to give orders for an air-strike. How long do we have? Twelve hours. You should get out of here. I don't have anywhere to go. Charlie, I'm finished... ...With the Militia, With all of it. Look, I appreciate the warning... ...but you can't come with me. Wait. You-- Be careful with that. What is it? It's a sonic canon. It emits a directional high-pitched audio frequency. Knocks its targets out cold. And you just sit down here with your necklace and your electricity... ...just making stuff? It's a hobby. Yeah. I obviously have a lot of free time, so... Thank you. Oh! Sweet. Look at that. Yeah, we'll take one of these. You Okay? Uh, no, Rachel. No, I'm not. I, uh... I have a confession to make about Grace. I do know what happened to her. I know why she's not answering her computer. Why? Randall got to her. - Randall? - And the thing is, Rachel, he got to me too. - No. - I'm sorry. - John? - I'm sorry. How's it all going? There's water damage, circuits are fried and software's corrupted. - It's a rat's nest. - I have every confidence in you. Listen, something's come up. I've gotta take a little trip. But I leave you in Mr. Austin's capable hands. You're leaving me with him? He's an animal. That's what makes him such an effective and loyal associate... ...ever since the DOD days. Just get the elevators working, Grace. Get me down to Level 12. And if I can't? How much time before the choppers get here? He said 12 hours. And we're sure this guy's legit? I don't see why he'd lie. Okay. They're coming at us with the big guns. We're not gonna be able to evacuate all the wounded in time. So my vote... ...we make our stand. - It's a long shot. - Miles and Rachel will be here with missiles. - And if they're not? - Then we use the guns we do have. I say we send a message to Monroe that he can't do to us... ...what the Russians, Germans, or al Qaeda couldn't. And if we go down... ...then we go down as Americans. I need volunteers. People to go out front, be the first line of defense against the choppers. I'm sorry about this, Rachel. I really am. John... ...listen to me. - You gotta let us go. - No. No, I had to tell him you were here. He's been looking for you. - You mean Randall? - Yes, I mean Randall. He's coming, Rachel. He'll be here soon. - He has big plans for you. - John, my kids. - You can't do this. - I don't have a choice. You know how dangerous Randall is. You know how unbalanced he is. Which is exactly why I don't have a choice, Rachel. Randall got into the tower. No. No, John, that's... I don't wanna hurt anybody. He's making me help him... ...and you know what will happen to me if I don't. And if you don't help him... ...you know what will happen to you too. - Hurry. - Who the hell's Randall? Trust me, you don't wanna stay around to find out. Let's get the weapons and go. And this Intel's accurate? Uh, yes, sir. I, uh, saw the Matheson girl myself. Did you see Miles with her? No. But we have to assume he's there, don't we? I suppose so. - Order the strike. - Yes, sir. Thank you, Tom. You did good work out there. Are you all right? You seem a little rattled. It's my son. He's dead. I'm sorry. Stack them right here. Danny? Danny. Danny, Danny. It's gonna be okay, all right? You're just having an asthma attack. Calm down. It's gonna be okay. Breathe the way I'm breathing. Just breathe, okay? Just breathe. - Hey. - How you doing? Terrified. Well, don't worry. Miles and Mom will be here soon. Danny, I gotta ask you for something. When the choppers come... ...I need you to get inside. What? The medics are gonna need help with the wounded. - I'm not hiding inside. - Yes, you are. And you know why? Because you owe me. Because I walked over a thousand miles to get to you. And I will never play this card again, I'll never ask you for anything again... ...but I'm asking you for this. Please, sit this one out. Look, you're right, I could never repay you for what you've done, but, Charlie... ...it's not your job to look out for me anymore. Charlie, I've gotta do this for Dad and for Maggie... ...and I've gotta do it for myself. Positions! Get in positions! Go, go! Come on. All right, now! That's them on the left. I see them. All right, nobody fires! Nobody fires until I give the order! Fire! Incoming! Everyone down! Get him out of there! Regroup! Watch your side! Fire! Get down! I'm out. All right, everybody stay down. Aim for that one. Amplifiers gotta be on that one. Miles? Miles? Miles, wake up. Wake up. Wake up, Miles. Danny! We've lost power. We're going down. Breathe. Just breathe. What...? What was I thinking? I never should have let you come here, let you... ...fight. I had you back. I'm... I'm his mother. I never should have let him out of my sight. I---- The two of you, you're... You're... There's nothing you could have done. Danny was set on this. You couldn't stop him. So the only thing that matters now is to finish what he started. We're going after Monroe. We're gonna help the rebels. We're gonna do whatever it takes and we're gonna kill him. You and me. For Danny. Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt you. - There's a visitor. - I'm not seeing anyone. I think you'll wanna see this one. Why? Because he drove here, sir. In a Cutlass Ciera. - How can I help you, Mr...? - Flynn. Randall Flynn. And this banged-up gentleman here is John Sanborn. And the question, general, is how can we help you? I love you, Danny. I love you to the moon and back.
