 Revolution (2012â€“2014): Season 1, Episode 8 - Ties That Bind - full transcript 
 Miles, Charlie, Aaron and Nora arrive at Freeport, Pennsylvania some 290 miles from Philadelphia where a major bridge will let them cross the Allegheny river. They walk into a trap however where militia Sgt. Will Strausser and his men are waiting for them. Strausser has taken Nora's sister Mia prisoner and his price for freeing her is simple: the pendant and Miles Matheson. They free her, but still have to find a way to get across the river. In Philadelphia, Jason Neville is being harshly interrogated and there is little that his father can do - until he gets hold of some information about another militia officer. Flashbacks reveal how Nora and Mia survived after the blackout. Mia has found their long-lost and Nora must choose between reuniting with her family or keeping her promise to Miles and Charlie.

 We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. Previously on Revolution:

 I gotta go get Nora. She's really good at blowing stuff up. - Full-on rebel now. - Why is that so hard to understand? - Not like you to fight for a lost cause. - Fought for us, didn't I? Bring the girl to me. That's an order. Ah! Get Strausser. Give him last known whereabouts. - Sir? - Lieutenant, you've been dismissed. It's just that Strausser isn't known to leave survivors, sir. - Jason. - Hello, Mother. - It's good to be home. - Where did that come from? - Ben. - My brother gave that to you? The pendant can sometimes turn the power back on... ...and bring machines to life. This isn't gonna work.

 It'll work. Find another bridge. Maybe one that doesn't have militia crawling all over it. Closest bridge is in Morgantown. A hundred miles away. - There's gotta be one closer. - There isn't. Militia blew them all up. And boats are torched on sight. Anyway, we get across this bridge, it's a straight shot to Danny. When I say so, we're gonna turn around and run like hell. - What? - We're walking into a trap. Now. Fire! Let's go! Move, go, go, go! Up this way! Check the rooftops, every damn alley. Now. - Are you okay? Did you get hit? - No, I'm fine. I'm okay. - What the hell was that? - I've never seen guns like that. - From the armory in Philly. - How'd they find us? It's Strausser. Who's Strausser? Believe me, you don't wanna know, and you definitely don't want him to know you. So how do we get across the bridge? We don't, not with him here. We gotta get out of town. - Try the bridge at Morgantown? - Don't have another choice. That's a hundred miles, that's days out of the way. Charlie, I commanded that entire damn militia... ...and there was only one guy that ever scared me. He's out there right now. We're in trouble. We lost them, sir. Ah. Unh! Well, then... Bring out the girl. - Nora! - Nora Clayton! Nora! Nora Clayton! Why are they saying my name? Nora Clayton! We have Mia! - Mia? Who's Mia? - We have Mia. Nora, just hold on. Hold on. Wait. - Nora, wait. It's a trap. - We have Mia! Nora Clayton! We have Mia! Who is that? My sister. @ https://thepiratebay.se/user/Zen_Bud  I'm gonna go look. Wait here. - Nora. - Mia. I told you to stay. - Where's Mom? - She's... She's not here. She left a note, said we should go to Dad's. - Why would she go without us? - Mia, we just need to go. Okay? I'm scared. Don't be scared. Nora Clayton. Nora. I trust I have your attention. You should know that gravity is compressing your sister's organs. Her lungs can't fight it much longer. She's suffocating. It's a horrible way to die. Fortunately, it won't take much more than an hour. I only want two things: The necklace. You know the one I mean. And Miles Matheson... ...for his crimes against the republic. You bring me what I want in time, and she lives. It's simple, really. I don't understand. They know we have the necklace. They know Nora is with us. It's your boyfriend, Nate, whatever his name is. He saw everything. Must have told Monroe. But how did they find Nora's sister? Strausser. Lives for this kind of thing. - Give me the necklace. - What? - No. You're not gonna just give it up to them. - Give me the necklace. Give it to me, Aaron. Miles. What is this thing made out of? - Not a scratch? - What is your problem? We cannot let Monroe have that thing. It's too dangerous. We're not giving them the necklace or Miles, either. We're gonna get Mia and kill as many of those bastards as possible. But I need help. - Stop. - We have orders. Excuse me? Whose orders did you receive that are more important than mine? General Monroe's, sir. What did you do? What do you care? Sir. - Colonel Faber. - How are you, major? Tom, you need to hear this. "Martin's Ferry, Ohio. Multiple reports that a lighthouse beam turned on for four or five seconds." Well, that's fascinating stuff, sir. Could I have a word? Anything you want to say to me, you can say in front of Colonel Faber. Jason's punishment, under your orders, he... He bribed a stable hand, Tom, for information on Strausser's whereabouts. Now, you know how important... ...how high-priority Strausser's mission is to me, right? So why then does your boy want to know about it? The Matheson girl. My son has a weakness for a pretty face. He's worried about what Strausser will do to her. So worried that he would betray a commanding officer? Let me handle it. I'll keep him in line, believe me. I'm sure, Torn, but it's not necessary. The colonel here had an idea. John? There's a diplomatic expedition heading out for the California Commonwealth. We're gonna put Jason on it. - California? Sir. - Yes? - Speak freely. - It's 3000 miles across the mountains. Even if he did make it, those heathens have been known... ...to send our boys home in a box. I'm being generous here, Tom, and that is out of respect to you. So it's California... ...or he faces execution for treason. It's your choice. Sir. - Man down! - We need help over here! Ah! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Get down. Go, go! It's good to see you again, Mia. I mean, despite the circumstances. Really, Miles? We're gonna pretend we're pals after what you did to my sister? So, what's the plan? We cross the river at Morgantown. Are you insane? You'd be heading into Philly. That's the idea. We should go out west, out of the republic. We can't. My brother is in Philadelphia. Monroe has him. And if we wanna get him back, we've gotta get across that river. - This is what you're mixed up in? - Yeah. - And I can't talk you out of this? - No. Okay, then, if you wanna cross the river, you're going the wrong way. I know a coyote. He has a ferry about 10 miles north of here, just outside Ford City. - He'll get you across, but it won't be cheap. - Get down. Dad? Dad? Dad. Where's Dad? He's not here. What about Mom? How come she's not here? I... I don't know. - Well, where is she? Where's Mom? - Mia. Why won't you tell me, Nora? - What's going on? - She's dead. Mom is dead, okay? - Is Dad dead too? - No. He'll be back. We'll just... We'll wait here for him. Let's get a better look, see if Strausser is still out there. You think we lost him? No, I don't. If he's not behind us, he's probably ahead, waiting to ambush. We just gotta get across that river. Listen, we need to talk. What is it? I know I've been missing in action the past year or so. Yeah? I took a trip to Texas. Nora, I found Dad. - You what? - I'm a bounty hunter, right? Finding people is the gig. He's alive. Uh... I don't... How did Dad...? Remember when we went to Galveston to find him? He was heading into San Antonio to find us. He buried Mom, figured we were dead too, so he never went back. How is he? Well... ...he's gray now, and cranky. Heh. Come with me. Let's go see him. We should get out of the Monroe Republic. No one's hunting us in Texas. - I gotta go to Philly. I promised. - Promised Miles? - You think you owe Miles anything? - I promised Charlie. - After we get her brother, I'll go with you. - After? You go into Philly, you won't get out alive. There is no after. It's her family. I'm your family. Tell you what, come with us to Philly. We could use you. No, I'm sorry, that's a suicide mission. Listen, I guess I'll get you and your friends across the river... ...and then go to Texas on my own. Come on, we gotta go. Thanks. So much for your coyote. We're never getting across this river now. Strausser. It's gotta be. Tom? What can I do for you, dear? I think it's what can I do for us. Rose, if you would come in here, please. Go on. Tell him what you told me. Mrs. Neville, I don't want anybody to get in trouble. Rose, now. Well, you know I clean houses for a couple other officers too. Including John and Anita. Yes. Colonel Faber and his family. - And I wasn't eavesdropping, I swear. - But you overheard... Yes. Talking about their son Stephen. He's got himself mixed up in something. In the Resistance. He's a rebel. That is a serious accusation. It's the truth. I swear. All right, you can go back to the kitchen now. Thank you, Rose. Isn't that terrible? I mean, Colonel Faber is one of General Monroe's most senior aides. The three of you were together just last night, weren't you? And his son is a traitor. How long have you known about this? Rose let it slip a few days ago. But you know me... ...I'm thrifty. I like to save up for a rainy day. General Monroe is sending our son to California for what? For asking a stable hand one stupid question. Can you just imagine if Monroe found out about this? Oh, I think I can imagine. I love you. I know. What do you think? Morgantown? Only play we got. Sorry. Guess this wasn't such a hot idea. We'll manage. I'm gonna go. Head to Texas. Hopefully get there by January. I don't suppose I can change your mind? Get you to come along with me? I'm sorry. No. Nora, I... It's a long walk. I don't wanna do it alone. And who else will look out for me, right? Look, I wish I could. I do. Give me a few weeks to get her brother back and I swear... But you won't come back. I need you. Dad needs you. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? - You gotta go. - No, Charlie, it's all right. I made you a promise. Yeah, and I'm telling you, you don't have to keep it. Your sister's right, I'm not your family. Look, if my Dad was still alive... ...and I could spend just one more minute with him, I'd do anything. I would give anything. It'll be a lot tougher to get Danny back without... I'll see you around. I don't know. These days, I doubt it. Doubt we'll ever see each other again. That's what you said last time. Unh! And to think, I trusted John. His son had enough ordnance to blow me to kingdom come. Caught him... ...and seven of his rebels friends just outside the city. - Any of them alive for questioning? - No. We executed them on the spot... ...including John's son. John, here, John claims they'd been estranged for years. Now, how do I know? Hm? How do I know where his loyalties lie, Tom? With his family? I can't take the chance. How'd you find out about this, Tom? Well, sir... ...trade secret. I do have a few cards up my sleeve. Well, you did me a favor. A big one. And I owe you. Actually, I was wondering, sir, if... I'd reconsider your son's situation. I figured you'd ask. Don't worry, Torn. I'm not gonna send your son to California. - He'll remain posted here. - Thank you, sir. But, Tom... ...keep him in line. You have my word. You still thinking about Miles? What are you talking about? I'm not thinking about him. The hell you're not. So how long did you hold out this time? Before you started sleeping with him again. I didn't. Seriously. He's not much for conversation. What else is he good for? - Mia. - Nora, it's okay. I led Matheson and the others to the ferry landing like you asked. - Mia, what did you do? - You can pick them right up. Thank you, Miss Clayton. - And you'll hold up your end? - I'm a man of my word. You and your sister are free to go. - Mia, what did you do? - What did she do? She just saved your life. Hyah! How could you? You gotta understand, I did this for you. You being strung up, that was all an act? Okay, look, truth is, the past year I was bounty hunting for the militia. I take it you were hunting down rebels? Since I was working with them, they knew who I was, knew I was your sister. When Strausser found me, he made me do this. I didn't have a choice. Did you ever even go back to Texas? Did you find Dad? Strausser said he'd kill us both if I didn't help find that necklace, whatever it is. - You know Strausser, he'd never stop. - Did you find Dad? No. You lied to me. - You would've done the same. - I'd never lie to you like this. Oh, really? How about, "Mom's not dead. She'll meet us at Dad's house at the beach"? They're my friends. They risked their lives for you... ...trying to save you from Strausser. And now they're gonna die, because of you. Don't try to find me. Don't follow me. You're gonna choose them over me? Nora, we're sisters. Don't. Strausser will kill you. Nora. Nora! Stop, stop, stop. The pendant, it was in my pocket. - What did you do with it? - What did I do? - You took it. - You make me wish I had. Come on. Come on out, Miles. You've got nowhere to go. Hold your fire! Hold your fire. I'm coming out. Unh! Miles. Lose the swords. - Corporal. - I'm a sergeant now. Well, let's be honest. You're a sociopath is what you are. Before the Blackout, you'd have been locked in a rubber room. Did you ever consider that maybe society was sick, not me? No. I never considered that. I will agree, it is true that the militia has been a healthy outlet for me. Arms out front. Keep them out. Cuff him. - We got a shooter! - Open fire! I knew you couldn't stay away. Go get Charlie and Aaron. Push them! Push them to the river! Let's go. Come on! Move, move, move! - We gotta jump. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Look, I already know, and you don't have to say it. What do you think will happen if Monroe figures out that necklace? I don't know. He will turn the lights on and buy the world a Coke? Not funny, Aaron. He doesn't care about lights. All he cares about is weapons. So while the rest of us are running around with swords and muskets... ...he'll have jets and drones. People are gonna die by the boatload. All because you couldn't tell if a girl had her hand in your pants. I said I get it. Now, get the hell out of my face. I'm so sorry. - I shouldn't have trusted her. - You didn't know. A couple years ago, I'd have done the same thing... ...without blinking an eye. You wouldn't now. Nora. Are we gonna die? No. Why would you say that? Everybody is dying, all around. I saw a lady die on the beach today. I didn't know what to do. She's still there. Well... ...don't think about her. You're all right. And I'm all right. And the only thing that matters to me is watching out for you. You don't have to worry either. I'm gonna watch out for you too. I know you will. Sir. With my compliments, sir. Thank you for your loyalty. I'll make sure you're properly rewarded. Thank you, sir. So much fuss for such a little thing. He's going to sleep for days. I'm sure the general is gonna sleep well tonight too, thanks to you. Thanks to us. He trusts you. As much as he trusts anyone. More. How would you describe his emotional state? Julia... ...just say what's on your mind. All right. Sebastian is not what he was. Ever since General Matheson left... ...he has become more and more paranoid and erratic. I mean, just look what he did to our son. It's just a matter of time before he does something like that to you. He is not fit to lead. Never, never say that. Not to me, not to anyone. We need a real leader. Someone who is strong... ...who knows what needs to be done and isn't afraid to do it. And I am sure you have an idea of who that should be. You always underestimate yourself. There is no limit to how high you can go... ...and what you can achieve. Rachel. I've got something for you. Where did you get that? No, the point is I got it. So now you have everything you need. - Grace. - What do you want, Randall? You should come see this. This isn't a trick. I'm not gonna hurt you. But you need to see this. It has ramifications for all of us. See that? Ben's pendant, heading east from Wisconsin. In the last 72 hours, it took off to Philadelphia like a shot. - What happened? - My best guess... ...I bet General Monroe's got it right now. What are you gonna do about it? I'm not gonna do anything about it, Grace. You are.
