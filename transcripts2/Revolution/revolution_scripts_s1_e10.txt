 NARRATOR: We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. Previously on Revolution:

 CHARLlE: Dad! - Danny's gone. My brother Miles is in Chicago. He can get Danny. I gotta get Nora. She's really good at blowing stuff up. My brother's in Philadelphia. Monroe has him. MlLES: To get him back, we've gotta get across that river. STRAUSSER: Fire! AARON: How'd they find us? MlLES: It's Strausser. [BOTH GRUNTlNG] MlLES: I'll have to walk to Philly, kill my best friend. CHARLlE: Miles and Monroe, what were they like together? - Best friends. CHARLlE: So why'd Miles leave the militia? Probably because he tried to assassinate Monroe. I think Monroe's obsessed. He hasn't been the same since you left. What do you think will happen if Monroe figures out that necklace?

 - All he cares about is weapons. RACHEL: This pendant powers up anything... ...within its range. How would you like to head up intelligence and interrogations? Julia will be happy to have me home. - I love you. - I know. You remember Dr. Jaffe. Major Neville brought in a second opinion. BRADLEY: It's a bomb. - You are dead! - You need me. - Rachel, I don't need you. I have Dr. Jaffe. Now you need me. [GUNSHOTS] [SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] I'm out. - Did you hear we're running out of bullets? - What? Yeah, Kipling told me. We've been shooting so many rounds for so many years. All these bandits, all these militias... ...we're running low. We're gonna have to ration. Or start using swords. [MONROE LAUGHlNG] We'll be like pirates. Ha-ha-ha. [PANTlNG] Bass, you gotta go. - Forget it. - Look at me, man. - Someone's gotta lead the men. - I don't care about the men. Don't argue with me. [EXPLOSlON] All the years... ...all the times I was in trouble, you never left my side. You never ran. [EXPLOSlON] If you're dying, I'm dying with you. [EXPLOSlON] Come on. Your head's bleeding again. We gotta get off the streets. Go somewhere safe. Miles, we're in Philly. There's nowhere safe. [SlGHS] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] KlPLlNG: Yeah, what do you want? I got a gift for Major Kipling. Leave it at the door. But it's me. I'm the gift. Captain Baker sent me. You got me for the whole night, sweetie. [GRUNTS] How'd I know that was gonna work? Oh, hell, no. No, you can't be here. Kip... ...you're about the only friend I got left in town. I need your help. [POUNDlNG ON DOOR] Yeah? What is it? MONROE: And you're absolutely sure? TOM: Wheatley is one of our best agents. He sent a coded message saying he was bringing in Miles Matheson... - ... through the subway tunnels. - Yet you found Wheatley dead. So how good could he be? Against Miles? How good is anyone? So Miles is in town. Either coming for his nephew or me. Sir, maybe you should think about heading to the house in Boston. Just for a few days. Run away? Is that what you're telling me? In all your wisdom? I'm just trying to be cautious. I don't run. I am at a critical point with Rachel Matheson. And we are days away from an all-out border war with Georgia. Just find him, Tom. We clear? [CHARLlE GROANS] So why in the hell did you come back? Hard to explain. Things are different now. How? I don't know. Things are just different. So, what happens if you come face-to-face with Monroe, hmm? I'll probably have to kill him. So, what's the play? I gotta find out where they're keeping Danny. - You guys stay here. - You can't go out on the street. What if someone recognizes you? They're my streets. Nobody knows them better than I do. I'll be back in an hour. Hey. Be careful. Come on. It's me. MAN 1: Freeze! Get your hands in the air! MAN 2: Stay where you are! - Stay where you are! MAN 1: Get down! MAN 3: Secure the perimeter. Check for weapons. Check all of them. You told them we were here? He didn't. He should have. But he didn't. Miles doesn't have many friends left in town. Kip's the closest to the subway. Finding you here? It ain't exactly brain surgery. Yeah? Well, if you're so smart then where's Miles? I don't suppose you'll just tell me where he is? Get them all out of here. MAN 1: Get up. [GRUNTlNG] Stop. What are you doing? [CHARLlE GROANlNG] Where are my friends? RACHEL: Charlie? Is that you? Mom? It is you. I knew- I knew it was you. Heh. I'd know you anywhere. Look at you. You're beautiful. How did you get here? You're hurt. Sorry. This has gotta be hard to understand. So where's Charlie? What have you done to her? You know... ...I know you. I recognized you the minute I laid eyes. That's Aaron Pittman. The wizard of Google. You've been on the cover of Wired magazine... ...more times than I can count. I bet you were high and mighty when the lights were on. I bet you'd boss around those poor bastards in their tiny cubicles. I was one of those poor bastards myself. But now... ...look at you. And look at me. Now you need Miles... ...saving your fat, pock-marked ass. In fact... ...that's exactly what I'm counting on. We're bait. This is a trap. Anyway... ...I just want you to know... ...I was a big fan of your work. - I didn't mean for any of this to happen. - You have to slow down, give me a minute. I was trying to do the right thing. I was trying to kill Monroe... - ... and escape with Danny. - Where's Danny? I don't know. I don't know if he's still alive. This whole thing is my fault. - Please stop. - I never- I never should've left you. - Or your father- - You need to stop! I just wanna find Danny. So you are gonna stop this. We're gonna find a way out of here, and we're gonna go get your son. You've grown up. It's been a long trip. [DOOR SHUTS] Charlie? Were you with Dad when he died? Yeah. Did he say anything? He said that I reminded him of you. Oh. And then he told me to go get Uncle Miles. - Miles is here? - Yeah. - Did he hurt you? - No, of course not. Why would you ask me something like that? [KEYS JlNGLlNG] Someone's coming. May I say, seeing you two ladies together... ...you're both very lovely. I'm a little bit aroused. Where are you taking us? MlLES: Would you mind pouring me one? Julia? Come on, Tom. You think I wouldn't know this was a trap? So? Wanna make a deal? My friends... - ... for your wife. JULlA: Unh. Are you all right? Yeah. Unload your clip. [JULlA GRUNTS] You went to my home... ...laid your hands on my wife. - I want Charlie... JULlA: Unh. ...and Danny. Or I will slit her throat. - Tom. Don't say anything else. - I would shut your mouth, Julia. What, you think I'm some hysterical bitch? Sorry. - I'm not the "beg for your life" type. - Julia. - Stop. - He's bluffing. So you love this woman, right? I mean... ...she's about the only damn person in this world you care about. Why would I help you? You're just gonna slit our throats anyway. I won't hurt her. I just want my family back. Tom. Don't. I have no choice. Wait here. [DOOR OPENS] Danny? Charlie? Charlie. What happened to you? I'm okay. I'm okay. - You came. - Of course I came. You're my brother. It's my job to look out for you. Cuffs off. Now go get Charlie and Danny. - They're not here. - Where are they? Miles. Both the kids, they're at the power plant north of the city. Monroe is there. He asked for them personally. - No. - Move. Okay, Tom. In you go. I am gonna kill you one day for this. You know that, right? Rachel. It must be nice having both your children back. Hello, Charlotte. It's nice to finally meet you. - I'm General Monroe. - What did you do to my son? I am completely and utterly done playing games with you, Rachel. You know what that is, right? - Amplifier. MONROE: A real one. Your friend, Dr. Jaffe, was building me a backup. That is, until you... ...shoved a screwdriver into his chest. Mom? Oh, I'm sure there's a lot about your mom you don't know. You've seen one of these pendants before, right? Know what it can do? Well, that machine amplifies its range. It makes jets fly. Tanks roll. And your mother is gonna finish it for me. Mom, what is he talking about? She's gonna be a real patriot. Isn't that right, Rachel? Mom. Look at me. Whatever he's asking you to do, you can't do it. Is that so? No. No, no, no. Mrs. Matheson, I'm sorry. But you need to choose which one of your children I'm going to kill. You son of a bitch. - Listen to me. - Which one? The boy or the girl? CHARLlE: I've seen the militia kill dozens. And if you help him, they will kill hundreds if not thousands, Mom. The boy or the girl. Which is your favorite? Mom, don't. Some things are more important than family. - Choose now. - Pick me. All right. - Have it your way. - No. It's okay. Stop! Stop! I will finish your damn amplifier. Stop. See? It's like Miles always said. A good hostage works every time. Take them to the holding cell. And if she steps out of line... ...if she even breathes funny... ...kill both the kids. Oh, they have got some very serious guns. Yeah. - Monroe keeps the good stuff for himself. - You ever seen this place before? Bass likes to use it to experiment. Psychotropic drug interrogation. Weapons R and D. But why's he keeping Charlie and Danny here? Whatever it is, it can't be good. But more importantly... ...I have no idea how to get in. I do. I think I know how. Just try something, Mrs. Matheson. Try and sabotage that machine. I want you to. Because then the general will turn your kids over to me. And I like your girl. She's a peach. And I could eat peaches all day. Any word from Neville? Nothing. - Maybe Miles didn't take the bait. - Maybe. Or maybe Miles killed Neville. Maybe he's on his way here now. General, what are you gonna do if you see Miles? What do you mean? Well, it's just that standing orders have always been to bring him in alive. I'm just wondering why that is. Miles is Ben Matheson's brother. Rachel Matheson's brother-in-law. He probably knows something about the electricity. Hmm. It's just that Miles sucks at math... ...so what's he gonna know about hardcore electric engineering? Sir, may I speak freely? I think the way we handle this is you let me kill Miles. I can do this. You think I can't? MlLES: Been looking for you. What are you doing? Uh... I was just having a little... A little family dinner. Okay. Come on, Bass. Let's go. You know, I always thought I'd be dead by now. I mean, that's logical, right? High-risk gig, two tours in Iraq. But my folks... My little sisters... On the way to a frigging Harry Potter movie. One drunk driver later and they're scraping them off the ground. How do you square that? You don't. I mean, I- I don't know. Should've been me. Okay. Hey, come on, man. That's enough. [LAUGHS] I got nothing left. I got nothing. Well, you got me. [LAUGHlNG] I mean, what the hell would I be without you? We've been brothers our whole lives, since we were kids. Heh. Bass, give me the gun. Before you do something stupid. [GROANS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG] Someone's coming. Okay, come on. Hey! [GRUNTS] You know how to use that thing? Guess I'm gonna have to learn. Come on. Let's go get Mom. It's an intake pipe. Leads to the condensers. We should be able to follow it right into the plant. NORA: Aaron, you have to stay out here. - Why? - What am I supposed to do with this? - There's some pipe bombs inside. In case anything goes wrong, we'll need a quick exit. - Blow a hole through the gate. - How will I know if something goes wrong? Believe me, you'll know. [POWERS UP] [AMPLlFlER POWERS UP] Would you look at that? [GUNSHOTS] [MEN SHOUTlNG AND GUNSHOTS IN DlSTANCE] RACHEL: What's going on? STRAUSSER: Go see. Damn it. [GUNSHOTS IN DlSTANCE] Miles. - You're Uncle Miles? - You're the reason we're in so much trouble. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - We gotta go. - We can't, my mom's here. Rachel's...? She's alive? Yeah. Monroe's been keeping her here as a prisoner. Okay, you gotta get Danny out of here. [GUNSHOTS] - Go! - Come on. Don't worry, Mrs. Matheson. I'm sure everything is going to be fine. [BOTH GRUNTlNG] [SPlTS] Monroe wants me alive. So do I. It's much more fun that way. That's for what you did to me, you sick son of a bitch. [GRUNTlNG] [PANTlNG] Rachel? Miles? [DOOR OPENS] Miles, you are like a bad penny, man. - Run. - Miles. I'll hold him off. Go get your kids. YOUNG BASS: I'm gonna kill you, Miles. YOUNG MlLES: I'd like to see you try, Bass. Hey, Bass. Miles. It's for both our names. Monroe and Matheson. Rachel's alive. Kept her prisoner for... ...how long? If you care so much about Rachel, why'd you leave her? She's my family, Bass. - How could you do that? - We're family, Miles. I'm your family. More than Rachel, more than Ben. Those kids? No. It was you and me. Remember? It was always you and me. We're brothers. You're just gonna kill me? Aren't you gonna do the same? No. I'm not gonna hurt you, Miles. Put your gun down. What are you doing? I'm not gonna shoot you. I want you to come back. You want me to what? We look out for each other, that's what we do. Even when the other one screws up. I forgive you, okay? I forgive you. You come back, I'll let your family live. I'll give you whatever you want. It was better, it was simpler with you here. Please? Now, you tried to kill me once before... ...and you couldn't pull the trigger. I understand that now. I couldn't do it either if I were you. And I don't think you're gonna pull it now. I'm sorry. It's o- Heh. It's okay. No, I mean I'm sorry I didn't kill you the first time. You're not the same person. You're too far gone. I see it now. We are not family. Not anymore. I have a family. You... ...are nothing to me. [EXHALES] [SCOFFlNG] [BOTH GRUNTlNG] Fine. If that's the way you want it. [BOTH GRUNTlNG] Damn it. Aaron, where are you? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG] - Hey. CHARLlE: Hey. - Where's Miles? - He'll be here. How do we get out? - Aaron's on it. - Aaron? Aaron Pittman? [BOTH GRUNTlNG] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG] Kill him. - Come on. Come on. - Okay. - Rachel? - I know. - I'll explain later. - Huh. Come on. - Run, you idiot. - Ha-ha-ha. [PROPELLERS WHlRRlNG] [WHlRRlNG] [English - US - SDH]
