 NARRATOR: We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. WOMAN: Previously on Revolution: - Back off! TOM: I'm sorry you're mixed up in all this.

 - If I couldn't have your dad, I had to take you. - You're a murderer. - I'll meet you in two weeks. - You're leaving? "I went after Miles. Please don't worry. Charlie." - Why are you following me? NATE: Following your uncle, same as you. - Those are the orders. - So you're militia. Wanna know the reason why I keep this? Somewhere inside are the only pictures of my kids. First steps, their whole lives. It's getting harder to remember their faces. Fire! [GUNFIRE] - Miles. - How do you know him? This is Miles Matheson. Commanding general of the Monroe Militia. Damn founding father of the republic... ...second only to Sebastian Monroe himself.

 Miles? [PANTING] [GRUNTS] WHITAKER: Hand it over. I'm sorry. I was hungry. Hungry? I have to take you in. For what? A week's rations? Know what they'll do to you for this? - Could just let me go. - If I did, you know what they'd do to me? - Nice work. - Thanks. My name is Miles Matheson. - You're joking. - No. All the stories are true, by the way. So when I ask a question, you answer. Okay? Captain Tom Neville. You know him? Dark skin. Eyes that kind of look right through you? He'd have been passing through this way and you got the only way station for miles. [SIGHS] - He was here, all right. - He have a prisoner with him? A boy. Nineteen, maybe. Blond hair. MILES: Where was he going? Noblesville. And you saw him when? Yesterday. Yesterday? [GRUNTS] That wasn't so hard, was it? Okay. Let's go. What stories does that guy know about you? He looked like he was about to wet himself. Come on, I told you, it's none of your business. Look, normally, I'd agree. Except every person we meet wants to capture you, kill you... ...kill us for knowing you, or they're terrified of you. - Charlie... - We're so close to catching up to Danny... ...and I don't know who I'm walking with or what I'm walking into. Damn it, Charlie, shut up! Let it go. I don't owe you an explanation. I owe you nothing. All right? You want your brother back? Drop it. Or I swear to you, I'm out of here, and you can find him yourself. AARON: Don't worry. They'll come. Miles said two weeks. Yesterday was exactly two weeks. - They're late. - Yeah, well... ...Charlie is a tough kid. She will be fine. And they will be here. ELLIOT: Mommy? When are you coming home? Two sleeps. Speaking of, it's late. What are you guys doing up? Sorry, Ms. Foster. They refused to go to sleep until we called. It's okay, Sonia. I hope they're not burning down the house. SONIA: No, ma 'am. They're dears. Read us some of Wizard of Oz first. No, not tonight. I've got to go and you've got to go to sleep. Please, Mommy. Just one chapter. - I said no. - Please. Elliot? AARON: Maggie? Maggie. Sorry, what? You know... We can't tell them, right? Tell them about...? The, uh, pendant. What do you... You don't trust them? You don't trust Charlie? No... That's not my point. Look, a thing like that... ...people will kill for it. Ben died for it. - The fewer people know about it, the better. CHARLIE: Hello? Charlie? Wasn't sure I'd see you again, heh. I'm fine. A few tight scrapes, but... - How are you guys? - Fine. Fine. We're just happy to see you. This is Nora. And this is who's going up against the militia? Really? - Now you see what I mean? - Um, we're standing right here. And this is all charming, but come on. Grab your crap. Let's go. - Oh, now? - Yeah. Yeah, Danny's close. We can maybe catch up by tomorrow. - You're joking. - No. MAGGIE: Let's hurry, then. [GRUNTING AND CHEWING] What is that? [GRUNTING] [BARKING] Run! [DOGS BARKING] [AARON YELLS] MAGGIE: Aaron! [DOG WHIMPERS] My leg. [PANTING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] DANNY: Hey. - Captain. - What? - Hold them up. MAN: Hold them up. - A storm's coming. - You scared of a little thunder? You didn't feel the shift in the air? I am telling you that we should find shelter. JIMMY: Sir. - The boy says we need to stop. Says we have some weather coming. Sir, we keep going, we'll be in Noblesville by dawn. It's only an hour away. Good evening, Rachel. Can't sleep? I never do sleep very well here, I'm... I'm not sure why. What do you want, Bass? What do I want? Rachel, as if you don't know. As if you don't know what I've always wanted. Do we really have to play this game? You've asked me these questions a hundred times. And I'm gonna ask you again. What was Ben working on? Ben was an algebra teacher. [CHUCKLES] If Ben was an algebra teacher... ...why was he working for the Department of Defense? And why did he have full SAP clearance? Why, on the night of the blackout, did he call Miles... ...and tell him the power was going out five seconds before it did? If Ben knew why the lights went out... ...he'd know how to turn them back on. I don't know what you're talking about. Haven't I been a good host to you, Rachel? [SCOFFS] I mean... ...I haven't put you in a dungeon. I haven't killed you. That's out of respect to you. To our friendship. Sergeant Strausser. Mrs. Matheson. My apologies. In advance. [AARON GROANING] Think I got rabies? Probably not. Probably not. Oh, this is great. This is so great. Ohh. You know, Charlie didn't deserve that. You exploding at her today. I know. You should go easier on her. I'm gonna go a whole lot easier on her. I'm gonna... I'm gonna leave. Excuse me? It is better for everybody if I leave. Better for them? It's better for you. Got the entire militia gunning for me. You're the same selfish dick with the same crap excuses... ...and whenever you get close to anyone, you take off. This is not about us. Don't start talking like it is, okay? You're right. It's about Charlie. And you made her a promise. I don't... I don't need any of this. - She's your family. - Doesn't make her my responsibility. I have no idea... ...why I signed on for this in the first place. It's not my fault... ...that her dad's dead. Not my fault what happened to her mom. I don't even know Charlie. Family or not, I'm just not doing this anymore. I'm out. Why do you have to leave? She's going for supplies. It's important, Charlie. But you've never gone on a trip like this before. I'll be back in a couple of months. Months? That's such a long time. - Just please don't go. RACHEL: Hey. I need your help. You listen to your dad. Protect your brother. Promise? - I love you. CHARLIE: I love you too. Come here. Mom. Morn, please. Mom, don't go! Mom, please. Please! Don't go. - You all right? - Yeah, I think so, thank you. [DOGS BARKING] MILES: Let's go. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [HORSES NEIGHING] SOLDIER 1; Hyah! Hyah! SOLDIER 2: Get in there. SOLDIER 3: Get them inside. Let's get this gear tied down, gentlemen. Get that door secure. Put it over here. Put it over here. - Don't move. SOLDIER 4: Easy with that. AARON: The funny thing is I used to be a dog person. I loved them. - Had a King Charles Cavalier. NORA: A what? AARON: They called them the lapdog of kings. Its name was Zoey. Sometimes it wore a sweater. NORA: Wow. Be right back. [GRUNTING] CHARLIE: Stop! - Stop it! Stop! MAGGIE: Miles. - How long you been following us? - Long enough. You just noticed? - You must be getting old. - Oh, stop it, both of you! - He's militia. - Nate, right? - His name's not Nate. - How do you know? - I saw him near Pontiac. - You what? She cuffed me to a pole. Took me two days to get free. - Look, I thought I handled it. - Yes, clearly you handled it. - Look, we have bigger problems here. MILES: He's a spy, Charlie. Who knows what he told Neville. Or Monroe. So let's find out. He's part of Neville's unit. You said so yourself. Don't you think maybe he knows something about Neville? Or Danny? Besides, what the hell do you care? You're leaving. - She's got a point, Miles. - Oh, hey. It's all good with me. I just get to keep a closer eye. Where are you going? Oh, I'm going to get my sword, if that's okay with you. Go to hell. England? Lady, that's just not possible. No, but I spoke to a man in Montana, and he said... You walked here? From Montana? No, I walked here from Seattle. And he said that you could get to the Atlantic from just here. Well, you could, but nobody does anymore. No. You don't understand how long it took, what I've been through just to get here. Lady, trust me. You can't get to the... - But I have to get home. - You can't get to England either. There are no more tall ships. No more steam boats. They were destroyed in the wars, or ripped apart for lumber, or the militia's got them. Hell, getting to England is like trying to get to the moon. Maybe one day. You've been very kind. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [HORSES NEIGHING] NEVILLE: Anything that moves gotta get tied down. Storm's coming, fellas. Gotta get this stuff secure. Put it over here. Get your asses in gear. Come on, come on, move it. Let's go. Come on. SOLDIER 1: A horse is loose! SOLDIER 2: Get him. Come here, boy. [GRUNTING] Easy, Easy. Easy now. Easy now. [GRUNTING] Come on, come on! Go, go! So you're leaving, huh? It's for the best. You don't know who I am, Maggie. You don't know what I've done. I do actually. Charlie told me. That makes you a murderer, right? Maybe one of the great ones. Then you understand why she's better off without me. That's probably true. But what makes you think you're better off without her? The hell is that supposed to mean? I spent years trying to get back to my boys. Years. I walked across the country. And then up and down the East Coast. You'd think I could find one damn ship to take me home. But I never did. Until... I gave UP- Knew I'd never see my kids again. That they probably died. Scared. Alone. Crying for their mother. So... ...I wandered. Found myself in Wisconsin. Picked a nice spot. Poured myself a cup of poison. And then, of all people... ...your brother found me. Hey. Sorry, I don't mean any harm. I just need to fill these up. Could you do that somewhere else? I'd rather be on my own. This might be a flier, but my kids and I have a campfire nearby. We caught more food than we can eat. Are you hungry? I think he saw something desperate in my eyes. Yeah. That sounds like Ben. I met his kids. Followed them all back home. And then I came to love them. Ben and his kids, they gave me a reason to live. They saved my life, Miles. They... ...saved me. So if you give that girl half a chance, maybe she can do the same for you. [DOGS GROWLING AND BARKING] There's a diner right behind us. Count of three, we haul ass, okay? Three! - Where's Maggie? - She was right behind me. Help! Help! [GRUNTING] [GROANING] MILES: Hey! Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Maggie. What happened? MILES: There's a guy out there. - What guy? Who? Maggie, what did he say? He said I killed his dog. MILES: Oh, this is great. MAGGIE: Hey, listen. It's not just a pack of strays. They belong to that psycho. - They're his attack dogs. MAGGIE: Listen. He severed an artery. I'm bleeding out. [THUNDER RUMBLING] So, Danny boy. How'd you get out of those cuffs? Look. We're stuck here. You can glower at me like you're sucking on a lemon. Or we can be civil. I like you, Danny. You remind me of my own boy. - You have a son? - Yes, I do. Am I really such a monster? Am I really so different than your father? I just want a future for my child. Well, my dad didn't murder people. He didn't hurt people like it was nothing. You don't remember the days after the Blackout. No food. No water. Nothing but panic and death everywhere you turned. If your daddy could go through all that and hold onto that kind of mercy... ...then my hat is off to him. He was a better man than I. CHARLIE: Sit back. Sit back. Okay. MILES: All right. With those dogs out there, how the hell do we get out? Right. Just keep the doors locked. Nora. Let's go. - You're going out? They're outside. MILES: We'll get on the roof. Hopscotch a few buildings over. - Put some distance between us. - To do what? I'm gonna find this whack job. And he's gonna call off his mutts. Believe me. How can we help? Leave. You know you have to leave, right? Maggie. No way. Danny is 24 hours from here. You're wasting time. We'll get Danny back. All of us. Together. MAGGIE: If you lost him because of me, I'd never forgive myself. Charlie, please. Maggie, I know I haven't been easy. My mom was gone and then you were there and I didn't... - it's all right. I understand. CHARLIE: You were there. You were always there for me. Kind. Protective. Annoying- [BOTH CHUCKLE] The least I can do is give you a taste of your own medicine. We're staying. Amen! [GROANING] Listen. The tourniquet's not good enough. I'm losing too much blood. CHARLIE: What do we do? There's a sewing needle in my bag. Some clamps. They look like scissors. - Wait. What are you saying? - You need to stitch the artery. - You're talking about us doing surgery? - What's first? You need to sterilize everything. I think Miles has some whiskey. [CHARLIE SCREAMS] - Charlie! - Damn it, Charlie! Charlie. Charlie! [THUNDER RUMBLING] [DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE] - Couldn't find him. - Miles, he took Charlie. - He what? - Which door did he come in? Miles. Heavily armed. Multiple knives. Hauled it through the kitchen. Last look, she was alive. You're coming with me. AARON: Uh. - I need to operate. I need help. - I'll stay. I'll bring her back, Maggie. NEVILLE: Hey, Danny boy. [PANTING] [WHINING] Aren't I in a pickle? I don't suppose I could get a little help over here? You walk up those stairs, that's just like killing me. So I'm supposed to show you mercy now? Look. I know I don't have the right. If your father was the man you said he was... ...how do you think he'd feel? To see his son murder someone in cold blood? Tell me. What would your father do? Come on, boy. Come on, help me out. You son of a bitch. [GRUNTING] I'm sorry. But you're important, kid. More important than you even know. KINSEY: Don't be afraid. You're home. My home. You live here? What's wrong with here? Nothing. it's... Safe. It's practical. You can survive a long time down here. Can you please... Please, let me go? KINSEY: Let you go? You'd kill me if you had the chance. No. No, we don't wanna hurt you, that's not why we... No. No one wants to hurt anyone. You look hard enough, you can find the good in everyone. That's what Lila used to say. Who's Lila? Is that your wife? No. My daughter. Is she here? She's dead. I'm sorry. It was my job to protect her. What other job does a father have? We stored up food. Meds. Everything except a gun. That turned out to be a mistake. Looters came. I fought them off, but there was too many. Did they kill her? Not right away, but yes. A few weeks later, Lila stepped on a nail. Simple and stupid as that. She got tetanus. She couldn't even open her mouth. She just sat there, dying of thirst right in front of me. Nothing I could do. I could have saved her. Would have been easy, if I had the meds. If the looters hadn't taken everything. I'm so sorry. I am. But people just aren't like that anymore. They've always been like that. You know, you remind me of Lila. You know... ...you could stay. If you want. We wouldn't have to be lonely. You little bitch. Acting all nice. Just because you're scared. MILES: Charlie! Help! Help, Miles! KINSEY: You can't trust anyone. Charlie. [GRUNTING] Where is she? [CHARLIE MUFFLED SCREAMING] Charlie. MILES: Charlie. [CHARLIE CONTINUES MUFFLED SCREAMING] MILES: Charlie, where are you? NATE: Charlie, where are you? - Charlie! NATE: Charlie! Charlie! Charlie. Charlie. [CHARLIE MUFFLED SCREAMING] You okay? Look at me. Are you okay? [DOGS BARKING] [DOGS CEASE BARKING] [DOOR OPENS] NORA: What happened to the dogs? Gave them a time-out. - Charlie? - I'm fine. How is she? AARON: I'm, uh, almost done. You saved me, Charlie. That's right, we're gonna save you. Okay. MAGGIE: No. You saved me. Thank you. No, no, don't talk like that. You're gonna be okay. - I've lost too much blood. - No. I did just what you said. I'd like my phone. Maggie, please. [CHUCKLES] "Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms... ...and having said one last goodbye... ...she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times... ...saying, 'Take me home. Take me home to Aunt Em'." Please don't go, Maggie. Maggie, please don't go. Maggie. MAGGIE: Bye-b ye, Dorothy. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. CHARLIE: Please don't go, please. [CRYING] Please don't leave me. Maggie. Everybody leaves me. Please don't. I'm not going anywhere. Okay? I'm not gonna leave. Back for more questions? No, just one question, Rachel. What kind of a mother are you? Excuse me? Well, you abandoned your children. You left them alone with Ben. Did you even stop and hesitate? Did it hurt? Or are you just too cold of a bitch to feel anything? Don't answer that. Now, your son's gonna be here very soon. And you think you're tough. But let's see how tough you are... ...when we start ripping out his molars. Let's see if you start talking then. Or like I said. Maybe... ...you don't even care about your kids. I guess we'll find out soon enough, won't we? Mom.Mom. Please. Mom, don't go. Mom! Mom! Please. Please. I came. Like you asked. Miles, you promise me. Just promise I see my kids again.
