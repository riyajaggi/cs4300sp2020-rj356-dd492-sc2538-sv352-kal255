 Revolution (2012â€“2014): Season 1, Episode 2 - Chained Heat - full transcript 
 Miles, Charlie, Aaron and Maggie head to Pontiac, Illinois. Miles is hoping to find an old friend, Nora, whose expertise, he says, is absolutely required if they're to rescue Danny. He learns the hard way that General Monroe has put a hefty bounty on his head when a bounty hunter tries to capture him. Miles is prepared to execute him but Charlie convinces him not to, something they will later regret. When they do find Nora, she's working as a slave laborer but she has her own plans. On the way back to their encampment, Captain Neville shows what happens to people who break the law. Meanwhile, Monroe calls on one of his prisoners.

 We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. Previously on Revolution: I have to ask you to come with us...

 ...under the authority of the Monroe Republic. - Why? - You can't take him. - Put it down. - Stop. - Danny's gone. - Dad! My brother Miles is in Chicago. He can get Danny. - Why take Danny? - We'll know when we find him. You dad was my friend. I am going too. - I'm Nate. - Charlie. I'm telling you, you can't trust anyone. - We're looking for Miles Matheson. - His brother was murdered by militia. - Just you. Come with me. - No way, buddy. She's my niece. I don't know you. Militia, huh?

 Why did Monroe want my dad? Monroe thinks your dad knew something. And he thinks your dad told me. - What? - Why the lights went out. Maybe how to turn them on. My mom is dead. My dad is dead. God knows what they're doing to Danny. - So you are going to help me get him back. - Why's that? Because we're family. I wanna wear my ballet slippers. No, we're gonna be doing a lot of walking. It's like Dora. It's like a big adventure. We are gonna walk right out of the city. - Where? - To the country. There'll be a lot of food and water and room to play. Can you do something for Mommy? - What? - Do you remember... ...when we were in Target, your brother wandered off? And I was running up and down the aisles? Do you remember... - ...how scared I was? - Yes. I need you to be a big sister. Your job, Charlie, is to not let go of your brother's hand. To never let go of Danny's hand. Okay? Can you do that? Daddy, I smell smoke. There might be a fire nearby. I don't hear any sirens. There's no more fire trucks, sweetheart. Charlie? You all right? I'm fine, Maggie. Just thinking. - Do you hear that? - Hey, where's Miles? Careful now, Monroe wants me alive, doesn't he? That's true. But he never said how many limbs. Miles. Miles, stop. - What? - He's unconscious. He's a bounty hunter. Probably not alone either. Area's crawling with them. You're gonna murder him in cold blood? Yeah, Charlie. That's the idea. Miles, please don't. It's, like, one day into this trip, you're already a pain in the ass. - All right, come on, Chuckles. - What? Help me get him into a boxcar. We gotta lock him up. And that's why God caused the blackout, friends. Why he wiped away our cars and planes, batteries and spark plugs... ...computers and phones. We built ourselves an electric Tower of Babel. We had power, but no truth. - Followers, but no family. - Great, they're having a sale on heroin. What'd that man do? It's the militia, could be anything. Spoke up, looked at them sideways, who knows? Danny's riding with guys like that and we're... What are doing here? I told you. I need to talk to somebody. Miles, wait. My little brother's out there somewhere. He hasn't been more than 5 miles from home. - It's my job to look for him. - You wanna see him... ...we're gonna have to go up against Monroe himself and his men. I can't do that alone. I need help. And my help is here. - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? Uh, this little place called "shut up and stay here." Hey. I'm looking for somebody. Plays cards here. - Lot of people play cards here. - You'd remember this one. Nora Clayton. - What's your business with Nora? - I just need to know where she is, okay? - Who's asking? - Don't you know? This is Miles Matheson. Should've killed me when you had the chance. That's what I said. So how'd you get out? I think I broke every bone in my hand... ...trying to punch my way through the wood, but what can I say? You're worth it. I don't suppose we can call it a draw? - Tell me where Nora is. - With the price tag... ...Monroe's got tacked on your ass? I don't think so. Well, give it your best shot. We'll see what happens. Okay. Let's see what happens. Yeah, I don't know them. Really? They were walking around the train yard with you. So? Met them yesterday. Been trying to bang the British chick. Then you won't care if I slice them open. All right. Let them go. - Miles. - Not a word. Let's go. @ https://thepiratebay.se/user/Zen_Bud  Is Nora here or not? No. Where is she? She's probably dead by now. She got arrested for stealing militia gold. They put her in some work camp south of here. In Fort Chatsworth, I think. You hear that? What that sound like to you, Danny boy? Can I help you? You know, my wife Julia, she grills these venison steaks. I don't know what she does to them, but man, oh, man... ...like she smothers them with love. Sounds good. You'll get a lot of steaks out of this guy. Burly son of a bitch. How'd you bring him down? Crossbow. I suppose he got this buckshot from a bar fight? - Listen, I don't know what you think I... - Sir. Are you familiar with the Baltimore Act? "It shall be unlawful for any citizen of the Monroe Republic... ...to buy, sell, own or transport any firearm." Except loyal militia, of course. Now, the penalty for this is death. So I'm gonna only ask you once. Is there something you'd like to share? Thank you. Search the house. - Hey, that's all I got. - And you're just a beacon of trust. Easy, son. Easy, easy, easy. Just take it easy there. Let me see. Open up, open up. Sir. Burn it. Burn everything. - Aah! - Sergeant Strausser... ...what do you think you're doing? I was interrogating the suspect, sir. Not like this. We're not animals. Sir, you all right? I'm Sebastian Monroe... ...president of the republic and general of its militia. I know who you are. Look, I am sorry. It's okay. It's okay. But you do know why you're here. I need to know where the other rebels are. Now, you tell me, you'll be with your family inside a week. I guarantee you. Look, you rebels are bombing my camps, you're killing my men. You're terrorists. But hasn't there been enough violence? Don't people have the right to be safe, happy? People aren't happy. They're scared to death of you. But I'm not. No, no, no... You know, it was probably all my fault. Yeah. It was. I blame myself. We made it out okay. - Yeah, that went like clockwork. - Swiss Army Knife, please, Aaron? What's this? - Just... - What are you doing with an iPhone? Swiss Army. Please. Charlie, next time I tell you I wanna kill somebody... ...let me kill them. She's gonna get herself killed. Thanks. - What are you doing? - Learning my lesson. I'll meet you in two weeks. Main Street in Lowell, Indiana. - You got that? - No, wait, you're leaving? I gotta go get Nora. We need her. Who is this woman, anyway? She's good at blowing stuff up. We can't get Danny without her. - Miles, please. Let us come with you. - Hey, you dragged me out here. Lowell, Indiana. Two weeks. Miles, come on. Where's my pack? Oh, you've got to be joking. Damn it. Charlie? Charlie? "I went after Miles. I'm sorry. Please don't worry. Charlie." Charlie! You? - I better take a look at it. - I don't need your help, Nate. Stay away. Oh, that's good, Charlie. - Really. I'm impressed. - Don't be. You were stomping around like an elephant back there. - Why are you following me? - Following your uncle. Same as you. Those are the orders. Bring him back alive. So you're militia. You used me to flush him out. You're a son of a bitch. So you're just gonna leave me like this? Yeah. You're such a crack soldier, you can figure a way out. Is your name even Nate? No. I've got orders. But then Why'd you save me? Maggie, slow down. - We can still catch up. - We don't know where she went. - And we can't hunt, not like she can. - Aaron, please. She will find Miles, but we will never find her. Not without a GPS. So we just let her go off to some militia prison camp? I'm not happy about this either, but we'll see her again. How do you know that, Aaron? How do you know that? Just... You know, we will. Do you wanna know the reason why I keep this? Because somewhere inside are the only pictures of my kids. Birthdays, first steps, their whole lives. And I don't have a single photo to hold in my hands. I spend hours staring at this stupid thing. It's getting harder and harder to remember their faces. So I'm sorry. But there's no way of knowing who we'll see and who we won't see again. Not anymore. Hey, cap. I'm pretty messed up, huh? I'm afraid so, son. It's die quick or die painful. That's all you got left. You drink every drop. Then you'll sort of drift off, won't feel a thing. I'm scared. Don't be. Down the hatch, son. Where you're going, you'll be warm and rested and fed. You'll be with your family. And the best part... ...you'll bask in the brightest, most beautiful light. Mommy, why are we here? Daddy had to get some things from our work. He'll be right back. My ball. - You like basketball? - Yes. Me, I love the Bulls, but... - Probably played their last game, huh? - Charlie? Charlie, come over here. - She's beautiful. - Charlie, come here. Such a pretty face. I'd hate to have to smash it in. I'd like your food, please. All of it. You're killing me. What are you doing here? - I'm coming with you. - I told you I'd come find you. Not good enough. Let me come with you. I get it, you want your brother. You've been... No, you don't get it. You need to let me help, okay? - Why? - Because it's my fault, Miles. What are you talking about? I took care of Danny. After my mom died, it was me. He gets these asthma attacks. So I had to watch him. I wouldn't sleep for more than an hour at a stretch. Checking on him ten times every night just to make sure he was still breathing. I didn't let him out of my sight. Until the day that they took him. Because I was off pouting like some brat. And if I was there, maybe I could have stopped them. Maybe my dad would still be alive. Maybe Danny wouldn't be off scared and alone. And if he gets sick, they're not... Miles, I can't sleep. You gotta let me help. I can't just sit there and wait. Okay, so I have a confession to make. Ben gave me this. He said to keep it safe, and to bring it to a woman named Grace Beaumont... ...in Grant Park, Illinois. - Who is she? - I don't know. Why? Why her? Maggie, what if we could get the power back on? What if you could go home again? What if you could see your kids again? So we take this to this Grace woman and she does what with it? I don't know. Ben just said she knew something about the power. - This doesn't make any sense. - But that, that's the thing. - I think it actually might. - How? The blackout, that doesn't make any sense. Totally corn-holed the laws of nature. And it shouldn't be permanent. We should be able to fix this, but for some reason, we just can't. - But if it were man-made... - Man-made? Why would someone do something like that? If I'm right, then this is good news. This is the best news. - How? - Because if it's man-made... ...then maybe we can fix it. And surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. - Amen. - Amen. Go ahead. Spit it out. - I'm sorry, what? - Have some conviction. If you think something, then say it. You don't like that I killed that traitor back there. Even though he owned guns... ...and a rebel flag. Even though he shot one of my boys. Well, I'll tell you What I think. I think the Monroe Militia is the one thing between us and total anarchy. Maybe it's just a finger in a dam... ...but it's the only order we got left. You wanna know what I think? I think that you tell yourself that. I think the truth is you like to kill. Because you're a murderer and a psycho... I appreciate the honesty. - Move it. - Lift. Keep that rope taut! Lift. Lift. Let's go, move. You there, pick it up. Crazy son of a bitch must think he can get the power going. Who? General Monroe. And if he does... ...imagine what he can do with one of those. Get over this hill before sundown. What'd those prisoners do? Most probably didn't pay their taxes. That's Nora. Hey. - Get up. - Get up right now. They're gonna kill you, get up. Up, you lazy piece of crap. I'll tell you something, I might be good with a sword... ...but I got jack squat against a rifle like that. Buddy, I'd keep your hands off, if I... - Hi. - Miles? No, get out of here. - These aren't even locked. - Because I picked it. Now go. Hey man, she doesn't wanna go. Take me. - Shut up. - Shut up. Come on. Go, go, go. Hey, wake up. Wake up. Thank you so much. I didn't wanna be rescued. - I sure didn't need to be. - Could have fooled me. - You were on a chain gang. - On purpose. Yeah, but... Wait, what? I got arrested on purpose. Give me some credit. - I'm working a job. - What job? The sniper rifle. I'm stealing the sniper rifle. You went through all that trouble for a rifle? - Who the hell is this? - I'm his niece. - You have family? - Most people do. And, yes, the rifle's more than worth it. Militia controls all the guns... ...so a beauty like that on the black market, priceless. I was gonna sneak up, slit the warden's throat, take the gun. - But now sneaking's kind of out. - Well, how was I supposed to know that? You weren't. You were supposed to keep away from me, remember? - Things are different now. - Like how? - Like how, Miles? - Like me. - He's here because of me. - Meaning? The militia took my brother and he's gonna get him back. Seriously, what's your angle? No angle. This is for real, Nora. And I want you to come with us. You owe me. - For that amazing rescue? - You know what for. Okay. - But I'm getting that gun first. - You'll never get close. Not now. Not without him shooting you with it. You want my help? We're getting that gun. Not exactly a Colt .45... ...but it'll do the trick. You're gonna shoot the warden... ...With that? - Yeah, that's the idea. - That thing only works from a foot away. - How we gonna get close enough? - Just sneak up. In broad daylight? They know what you look like and they'll kill me on sight. So I'll do it. Some innocent girl, lost in the woods. I can get close. I like her. I like her a lot. Forget it. It's a good idea, Miles. She just takes out the warden. And you and I sweep up the rest. - You can't do it. - I appreciate the concern but I... No, no. I mean, you actually cannot do it. You will choke. - I won't. - You who bitched about me killing... ...somebody in cold blood, you're gonna shoot somebody... ...for a sniper rifle? It's not about the rifle. - It's not about you or her. - What's it about? The 30 innocent people down there who are working as slaves. It's insane to me that neither of you have mentioned it. What the hell is wrong with you? So, what do I have to do? Lift. Lift. Lift. You. Put it down right now. - I'm sorry, I was just hunting. - What the hell are you doing? I was hunting. I got lost. Hey. Take it easy. Bring her over here. I'll snap her neck, stay back. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Let her go. Are you sure you wanna do that? I mean, what if you hit your little girl? No. Come here, baby I'm just hungry. Stop. We need that food. I can't let you take it. I'll shoot. I don't think you will. I said stop. So you're lost, huh? I know the area pretty good. Where you from? Gun! Hey. Hey. Okay. Gotta hand it to you. You did good. Did good? Yeah. All these people are free. I killed two men today. Maybe that's not a big deal for you... ...maybe it's another Monday or whatever, but it is to me. We shouldn't have to do this. Things should be... I don't know. You are... ...very unusual. What's that supposed to mean? It's not an insult, Charlie. Oh, son of a bitch. What? When did you get that? Just relax. You're not selling that sniper rifle, are you? You'll give it away to the Resistance. Everyone changes, Miles. - You joined the Rebels? You? - What do you mean, Rebels? - A bunch of deluded, bleeding heart... - Patriots. Trying to bring back the U.S. - They will lynch you on the spot for this. - Maybe. Or maybe I'll take out General Monroe first. Hello, Grace. Come on. Rachel. They treating you well? I told them anything you want, wine, ice... Thank you, Bass. What more could I possibly ask for? It's always nice to see you, Rachel. It's always nice to see someone who knew me from the old days. You were a womanizing drunk, and I liked you a lot better then. Everyone did. Miles did. Hell, I think even I did. Why are you here? I have some bad news, Rachel. Ben's dead. You're lying. I wish I was. I take it you're the one who killed him. Understand me that it's the last thing that I ever wanted. I'm sorry. Are we finished here? No. There's something else. I have your son. No more games, Rachel. You wanna see your boy again, you're gonna talk... ...about Ben, about the power... ...about everything, you understand?
