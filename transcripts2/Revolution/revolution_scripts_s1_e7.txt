 Revolution (2012â€“2014): Season 1, Episode 7 - The Children's Crusade - full transcript 
 Still on their way to Philadelphia Miles, Charlie, Nora and Aaron come across a band of children who have been on their own since the death of their parents some years before. The eldest among them, Peter, has been forcibly recruited into the militia and taken away. Miles and Charlie agree that they can't set off and leave the children and so decide to try and rescue Peter. At Monroe's headquarters meanwhile, the General and his new intelligence chief Major Tom Neville are unhappy that the information Rachel gave them has yet to produce any of the pendants. In flashbacks, it's revealed that Rachel, her husband Ben, Grace Beaumont and another scientist, Brad were all working on a way to produce cheap electricity. What they found was something else completely.

 NARRATOR: We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. Previously on Revolution:

 CHARLlE: No. No. No. [GRUNTlNG] The thing about iron is... ...no matter how tough it is... ...you can beat the hell out of it, mold it into whatever you please. That's what we do here. You see, militia soldiers aren't just born. We make them. No, no. No. Please. Please. It's time for you... ...to become an official member of the Monroe Militia. No. No. No. No. Aah! [BRAND SlZZLlNG] SOLDlER: Hyah, hyah! Don't you move. MlLES: I know what you were thinking back there. Oh, yeah? What? That we should have saved that kid. It would've been too risky. You can't save everybody. So you gonna rescue some stranger or we gonna go get your brother? Oh, my God. MlLES: Charlie, hang on. - He's still breathing. - Charlie- This isn't our problem either? AARON: Son of a bitch! What the hell? Where did you take him? NORA: Who? We didn't take anyone. You're gonna poke your eye out, kid. Where are your parents? Where's Peter? What'd you do with him? - Calm down. Who's Peter? - Check their arms. They don't have burn marks, Michael. It's not them. CHARLlE: Does Peter have blond hair? Was he wearing a green shirt? MlCHAEL: You took him. No, the militia did, the guys with the burn marks. We saw him being carried away on a wagon. What's militia? Is Peter your friend? He's my brother. I'm sorry. Where the hell are your parents? We don't have any. [WHlSTLES] Yeah, no, this is not totally creepy at all. They're just children. Children of the Corn. What did they do with their parents, huh? I'm telling you kids skeeve me out. In your village, weren't you the teacher? Not a lot of employment opportunities post blackout. MlCHAEL: Davis, you're in charge while I'm gone. Slow down. - Which way did they take him? - Just stop. You tell us what happened to your parents or we're not talking. It was a long time ago. Those men came. The ones with the burn marks and wagons. - Why did they come? MlCHAEL: We don't know. We think it had something to do with that flag. We think they didn't like the colors. Our parents hid us in the basement. Said they were coming right back. Peter was oldest so he was in charge. But then... ...we heard screams. Shots. We were all crying. We waited and waited. But our parents never came back. Then we went outside. The first thing me and Peter saw was our mom. And then the others. All- All dead. Peter kept us alive. He brought us here. He still tells stories to the little ones about their parents... ...so they don't forget. I don't have time for this. I have to go. Michael, just wait. MlCHAEL: We'll need everything we have. You can't go after the militia. It's too dangerous. We can take care of ourselves. What if we do it? - What? - We'll get your brother back. We're gonna do what now? Why would you help me? Because the militia took my brother too. Did you get him back? Not yet. I'm trying. Charlie, can I talk to you for a second? AARON: This is a bad idea. Maybe. But we still have to do it. Look, I hate to say this, but that is not Danny on that wagon. Yeah, I know that, Aaron. If we don't go, those kids will. They'll attack the militia. We know what's gonna happen. They're children. At least we stand a chance. Miles, do you wanna weigh in on this? She's right. But you just said that we can't save everyone. Yeah, well we're saving this one. We'll track that wagon, get your brother back. But you stay here and stay out of trouble, okay? We're sitting in a cage. And you're acting like nothing's wrong. We have food. We have beds. It could get worse. - A lot worse. - Please. - We have to leave. - Shh. They'll hear you. [DOOR OPENS] Ma'am, General Monroe would like to speak with you, please. MONROE: Rachel. Thank you for coming. How's Danny? Is he settling in? You wanted to see me? Well, it's these pendants, Rachel. Now, you've told us about these seemingly magical pendants... ...that somehow turn on computers. And yet we've not been able to find one of them. I've told you everything that I know. No. No, you've sent us to a string of abandoned houses. Most of your colleagues are not where you said they'd be. Well, I haven't really kept in touch. I've been out of the loop for some reason. No, no, I said, most. Not all. We did manage to find one of your friends. A Dr. Bradley Jaffe. Brad. He's here? Yes. For three weeks now. Three weeks? TOM: He's been a tough one to crack. And we've been cracking hard. Bass. Whatever you're doing... ...please stop. As soon as he gives us his pendant. I'll talk to him. Just leave him alone. We were hoping that you'd say something like that, Mrs. Matheson. And may I say that your cooperation is warmly appreciated. [GRUNTlNG] Okay. [PHONE RlNGlNG] Okay. Show me what you got. What we've got, Mr. Flynn, is a mistake. My partners and I, we set out to invent a device... ...that generates clean, low-cost electricity. We failed completely. It doesn't work. In fact, it does exactly the opposite of what we intended. Instead of generating electricity, um... ...it inhibits it. Well, that's a failure, but it's a very, very interesting one. Brad, Grace, if you please. [KEYBOARD CLACKlNG] [ELECTRlClTY CRACKLlNG] [KEYPAD BEEPlNG] [DOOR BLEEPlNG] So can this be replicated? - Yes, sir. - On how large a scale? RACHEL: Ben. What's going on? Rachel, this is Assistant Secretary Flynn from the DOD. Nice to meet you. Ma'am, I am impressed. Now, I can't guarantee anything, of course... ...but I'm gonna recommend we offer you a full contract. - Really? - This little start-up of yours... ...is about to become a very large and important company. Ben, a word. How can you not tell me about this? I knew you'd react exactly the way you're reacting. - Don't get cute. - A government contract is not the worst. - With the Department of Defense? - Rachel, we are crashing and burning. Another month, we won't be able to keep the lights on. The DOD is a lifeline. What if they want to use it as a weapon? Have you thought about that? You- You have. See these? More than one wagon we're following. Dozens of treads here all going the same direction. - Meaning? - Nothing good. - What is up with Miles? - What do you mean? I mean, the guy has raised dickishness to an art form. And suddenly he's down to rescue some strange kid? That doesn't surprise you? - Not really. - Why not? Think about it. Those kids lost their parents, what, seven, eight years ago? When Miles was in charge of the militia. Those kids became orphans under his watch. [BUSH RUSTLlNG] MlCHAEL: Hey, let go of me. - Look what I found. - Michael, you have to go back. Pete is my brother. You can't stop me. It's irritating when a dumb kid tells you what to do, isn't it? Fine. Stay close. [WHlSTLES] I take it they're not gonna turn around either. No. Awesome. It's like a pack of hairless Ewoks. Welcome to your new home. Hey. I'm Nora. You thirsty? You want some water? It's okay. Hey, what are you d-? Give me that back. I don't like you. Feeling is so mutual, kid. MlLES: Hey, Aaron. - What's that? - Nothing. It's my necklace. Kid tried to steal it. You seem nervous. [SCOFFS] What makes you say that? You're sweating. I just ran. Miles, you gotta see this. What is that? MlLES: It's a conscription facility. A soldier factory. Kids go in... ...they're re-educated... ...soldiers come out. It's one thing snatching a kid off a wagon, Charlie, but this... You don't just storm a place like that. It's impossible. [GRUNTlNG] [GROANlNG] Please. Please. Please help. [MACHlNE BEEPlNG] DOCTOR: Okay, look at this. You see this line right here by the heart? Blood vessel? There are supposed to be two of them. One's missing. Baby's not getting enough circulation to the lungs and other organs. What does that mean? What do we do? We could induce and operate, but he'll be too weak. Chances of survival are low. Or you could carry the baby to term. The condition will get worse. It's unlikely he'd survive the stress of labor. I'm sorry. Ben. He said "he. " He's a boy. I can't breathe. [RACHEL CRYlNG] [DOOR OPENlNG] [MAN GRUNTlNG] [GRUNTS] [RACHEL COUGHlNG] Hello? Who's there? Bradley? Rachel? Brad? Is that you? It's me. It's so good to see you. We thought you were dead. Did you hide the pendant? Yeah. We have friends here. Some of the guards are with the rebels. If you tell me where it is, the rebels can go and get it. Before Monroe does. - They'll keep it safe. - No. No, it's too risky. It's better than Monroe finding it. He can't make you talk... ...if you really don't know where the pendant is. I gotta say... ...I've been wondering how Monroe knew about the pendants. I'm not telling anyone anything. - Bradley. - This conversation's over. Brad. - Uh-uh. Forget it, that's not happening. - I look the same age as those recruits. - I could get in, find Peter, get out. - Hey, I wanted to help, I did. Not if it means you going in there. - If I don't, Michael will. - I said no. Charlie. What happens on that boat? That's my fault. What happened to Peter and Michael and their parents... ...and what's happening to Danny... ...that is all because of yours truly. How do we even know we're gonna get Danny back? I'm serious. With our luck? Come on. I have my doubts. But we can help these kids. Then at least all the crap that we've been through will have meant- Will have meant something. All right. If you're gonna get Peter back... ...you're gonna need a master key. And that's gonna hurt. SOLDlER: Whoa. So... What's a pretty girl like you doing out here? All alone. I'm not alone. My family's hunting. They'll be right back. A whole family? And you got just that one little bag? I don't think so. [CHARLlE GRUNTS] So, what? You work for these people? For Monroe? No. I'm a prisoner here. Brad, they are going to kill you. There's worse things than dying. Like betraying all your friends. All the years I've been here... ...I never said a damn thing to Monroe. Until he showed up with my son. My son. If I don't cooperate, they will hurt him. They will torture him. So yes... ...there are worse things than dying. I'm sorry, Rachel, I am. But you hand Monroe the pendants, that kind of power... ...we're talking thousands, if not millions of lives... ...against the life of one boy. It's easy to be self-righteous... ...when it's not your child who's on the hook, Dr. Jaffe. You should've listened to Mrs. Matheson. But she was wrong about one thing. We're not gonna kill you. Daddy? BRADLEY: Eve. - Unh! You bitch! RACHEL: I didn't know. Don't worry. We'll keep your daughter safe for you. Please, don't do this. But you were the one who told us about the good doctor in the first place. After that, it was easy to dig up his daughter. - Take her. BRADLEY: No! EVE: No, please, no. BRADLEY: No! - I didn't know they were going after Eve. BRADLEY: How could you do this? Sorry. I'm sorry. [BRADLEY SHOUTlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] [SOBBlNG] My name is Lieutenant Slotnick. And I wanna welcome you. I know that some of you are feeling very scared right now. But let me tell you that this is going to be... ...the best thing that has ever happened to you. You get the chance to fight and die for something that truly matters. General Monroe has led us away... ...from the filth and the corruption of the United States. He's given us strength. And morality. And the Monroe Republic will be the greatest nation... ...that this world has ever seen. You all right there, son? Step out. Come on. Go on, you can speak freely. I just- I just want to go home. All right. Go on. You're free to leave. Anyone can. Go on. Really. [STlCK THUMPlNG AND BOY GRUNTlNG] Anyone else feeling homesick? SOLDlER: Your quarters are this way. 8288, over here. - Watch where you're going. - What's your problem? Maybe you, ever thought of that? - Crazy bitch. - What did you call me? Look, I'm not gonna hit a- Aw. That hurt? Unh! Look, Charlie's tough. She'll get your brother back. Trust me. Why should we? You're a grown-up. I'm one of the good ones. I haven't met any of the good ones. Now you have. You wait and see. [GROANlNG] Follow my finger. Good. This will help you relax. [GRUNTlNG] You know, I had a feeling you were trouble. MlLES: She's two hours late. Something's wrong. Let's go get them off that boat. CHARLlE: No, no. No, please. You see, militia soldiers aren't just born, we make them. And it's time for you to become an official member of the Monroe Militia. No. No. No, please. No. No! Aah! [BRAND SlZZLlNG] [BODY THUMPS] Where's Michael? He went to go get Peter. You're joking. [BELL RlNGlNG] Unh! [MlLlTlA MEN SHOUTlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] Hey. MlLES: Let's go. Charlie! - Charlie! - In here! Miles! I'm okay. Let's get Peter. Michael sent me. We're getting you out. [DOOR THUMPS] [SOLDlER SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] SOLDlER 1: Sure you heard something here? SOLDlER 2: Sure. Hello? [WHlSPERlNG] Come on. SLOTNlCK: Hold it. This kid mean anything to you? Michael. - Let him go. SLOTNlCK: Stay put. Or I cut his throat wide open. Weapons on the deck now. [FOOTSTEPS] [SOLDlER SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] [WHlSPERlNG] No, no, no. Not now. - It's like a firefly. - Shh. [ENGlNE SPUTTERlNG] [ENGlNE WHlRRlNG] What is that? SOLDlER 1: What the hell was that? I've sent riders to Dr. Jaffe's house. As soon as we have the pendant, he and his daughter can go home. You know... ...you never did tell me. Tell you what? How the lights went off in the first place. What was this invention of yours? What could possibly do that? What difference does it make... ...as long as I can turn the lights back on again? [CHUCKLES] FLYNN: Rachel, right? Yes, Mr...? Flynn. From the DOD? Yeah, I remember. I'm sorry if I'm overstepping... ...but I heard about the pregnancy. Your baby's condition. You are overstepping. Of course, and I'm sure you've looked into all the research. Yes. I have. Even the new fetoscopic trial at Columbia? It's full. What if I told you it wasn't? They're seeing some pretty incredible results. Solving the very problem you've got. I have a lot of friends in a lot of places. I'd be happy to make a call, get you in. Give your baby a fighting chance. And what do you expect in return, Mr. Flynn? Look, I'm not such a bad guy. I just want to help you out, that's all. At work and at home. I just want us to be friends. [ALL CHATTERlNG] KlDS: Peter! Hey. - How are you? - I'm good. Good, I missed you guys. You been doing okay? You guys. Oh, my God, I missed you so much. [PETER AND KlDS SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] What in the hell happened? - What do you mean? - I don't know, Aaron. Maybe I'm talking about when you were in the lighthouse and it went on. How did that happen? - What are you not telling me? - Fine. Okay. It was this. It can sometimes turn the power back on... ...and bring machines to life for just, like, a few seconds. And I don't know how and I don't know why. Where did that come from? Ben. My brother gave that to you? And you have had something like that... ...on you the whole time and you haven't said anything? Give it to me. - Why? Why? - So I can smash it. This could literally be the most important thing in the world. Which is exactly why we can't let Monroe get his hands on it. - Give it to me. - I'm not giving it. Aaron, I swear to God. I'm gonna beat you unconscious and take it. Give it to me. - Go ahead and try. - Hey. What the hell is going on? And what happened in that lighthouse? Someone start talking. I think... ...that they came for your dad because of this. Why? There's a woman named Grace Beaumont. And just before the militia came... ...your dad gave me this, and told me to keep it safe and bring it to her. FLYNN: Hello, Grace. Randall, this is crazy. Just let me go. FLYNN: You know I can't do that. It's too dangerous. And we both know why. What do you want, Randall? Grace. I just want us to be friends. [English - US - SDH]
