 NARRATOR: We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. MAN: Previously, on Revolution: I have to ask you to come with us.

 DANNY: You can't take him. - Kid, put it down. - Stop. Stop. - Back off. Danny's gone. My brother Miles is in Chicago. He can get Danny. Why did Monroe want my dad? Why does he want you? MlLES: Monroe thinks your dad knew something. He thinks your dad told me, so I must know it too. - What? - Why the lights went out. Maybe how to turn them back on. God knows what they're doing to Danny now. You are gonna help me get him back. - Meet you in two weeks. Lowell, Indiana. - You're leaving? - I gotta go get Nora. - Who is this woman, anyway? - We can't get Danny back without her. - Charlie?

 "I went after Miles. I'm sorry. Charlie. " MlLES: That's Nora. I got arrested on purpose. I'm stealing the sniper rifle. [GRUNTlNG] When did you get that? You're not selling that sniper rifle, are you? - You joined the rebels? - What do you mean, rebels? They're trying to bring back the United States. Ben gave me this. We take this to this Grace woman, and she does what with it? AARON: Ben just said she knew something about the power. MlLES: Nora, come on, be reasonable. - We've been over this, Miles. - It's just a gun like that? Hard to find these days. You should keep it. Use it to get her brother back. The rebels need it. More than we do. You're really serious about this, huh? Full-on rebel now. - Why is that so hard to understand? MlLES: Because I know you. It's not like you to fight for a lost cause. I fought for us, didn't I? Uh, is this a private conversation? - No. - Yes. I'm just... ...trying to look out for you. You think you and your rebel pals are gonna bring back the United States? Really? They're gonna butcher you. I wonder. If you really believe all that... ...or if you're just scared of going up against Monroe. MONROE: You've gone insane, Miles, you know that, right? MlLES: Rest of the world's gone insane. I'm just keeping up. Okay. Right. Well, one, you're going AWOL. And two... What, are you gonna walk to Chicago? - I gotta find my brother. - It's like a thousand miles away. I'm not gonna just sit here. Everybody's just sitting here. Waiting for orders that aren't gonna come. Okay. All right, let me pack. What? I'm coming with you. No, Bass, you're not. I'm not dragging you into this. My family. My problem. And you're my family. That makes it my problem. I'm not asking you. This is your rebel base? MAN 1: Hey. MAN 2: Don't move. Take it easy. NlCHOLAS: It's okay. - Nora. Thank God. - Nicholas. [BOTH CHUCKLE] You got the rifle, heh. Did you ever doubt it? Hey. I'm Stu Redman. This is Frannie. They're friends of mine. Listen. We're in trouble. It's bad. What do you mean? [PEOPLE COUGHlNG] Oh, my God. What the hell happened? NORA: Easy. Easy. WOMAN: Hey, you. A little help. Keep pressure right here. I can't, I can't... We went on a raid this morning. Militia supply dump out in Chatsworth. We were trying to score some guns, but... ...it was a trap. Soldiers came from everywhere. Are all your people accounted for? Twelve dead. - One missing. - Missing? Was he captured? - I don't know. - You don't know. What if he was? What if he's giving up your position? And who are you? NORA: Nick. We can't stay here. - We gotta patch these people up and go. - We're in no shape to travel. You don't have a choice, pal. - Militia could be coming right now. CHARLlE: Guys. That man's dead. This is what being a rebel gets you. Just tell me. Where's your rebel camp? [WHlMPERlNG] Okay. [GUN CLlCKS] You know how hard it is to find a bullet these days? I mean a proper bullet. Smokeless powder. Copper jacket. That kind of thing. You know, they can't even make them. Not in this medieval cesspool. Nope, we've gotta go scavenging for antiques. Where's your rebel camp? [GUN CLlCKS] [HOSTAGE WHlMPERlNG AND COUGHlNG] Yes, siree, bullets are about as rare and precious as diamonds. Which is why I only put one bullet in this gun. And why I would prefer not to use it. [GUN CLlCKlNG] We're gonna get there sooner or later until you tell me where your camp is. [STAMMERlNG] Five miles east down the road. The old restaurant. Thank you. Appreciate that. Get ready to move out. And tell the men, no survivors. [HORSE NElGHS] Here. Ah, damn, I'm sorry. - You got a problem? - What? No. What possible problem could I-? Oh, wait. You know, there was that one time in your little crap village... ...where you shot my best friend with a crossbow. So, yeah, I guess there's that. Your best friend murdered my father. Which, uh, let's be honest, was probably no big loss, right? Captain Neville. What? If you want me dead, just kill me. Otherwise... ...I'd like some water, please. You heard the boy. Give him some water. Yes, sir. I don't wanna break up your little, uh... Whatever this is. We need to talk. Take your hands off me. We did it, okay? We delivered your stupid rifle to your whiny-ass rebel buddies. - It's time to go. - Look around you. These people are hurt. You don't get it. What happened, that was a kill order. Militia's gonna be hunting for them. It is not safe. All the more reason to get them out. - We're looking for her brother. - Exactly. It's my brother, so this is my call. Excuse me? - How much time do you need? - Half hour, tops. - That's a promise? - Oh, you are joking. All you ever say is, "We gotta find Danny, we need to find Danny. " That clock's ticking. Now, you wanna hang around, play wet nurse? You said we needed her to get Danny back. Needed. Those were your exact words. Right? So she's staying, I'm staying. And you can do whatever you want. So the woman who can turn the power back on lives... ...here. It's a little low-key, I'll give you that. Hello. Grace Beaumont? Stop. Something's wrong. Grace? This is... [CHUCKLES] It's an eight-bit register. An ID connector. A CPU. Last time I saw one of these, I was happy and so, so rich. If I didn't know any better, and I am not sure that I do... ...I would say that Grace Beaumont built herself a computer. - That's- - Insane. Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Who would build a computer unless they had electricity? Aaron, we can't stay. Something bad happened here... ...happened to Grace. What if whoever did it comes back? We risk it. I gotta figure out what's going on here. Because if Grace really had power, and it sort of looks like she did... ...how is anything more important? CHARLlE: You'll be okay. I broke this one in three places. - Healed just fine. - How'd you do it? A boy from my village, he was a bully. A real dick, actually, heh. He's about five years older and 50 pounds bigger than me. But I still managed to knock his front teeth out. - Remind me not to pick a fight with you. - I will. Okay, I think I get it now. Get what? It's, uh, Shaq over there, isn't it? The honest love of a good man. It's why you're fighting with these amateurs? Wow. Can you boil everything down to getting laid? Yeah. You're acting like a jealous kid. Well, something happened to you. - I'm betting it's that guy. - He's a priest. Sorry? Nicholas. He's a Catholic priest. Oh, so you're not his type. - Hey, look, I'm just trying to understand. - You're right, okay? I'm here for a guy. And it's not Nicholas. And drop it. Five minutes. Then we're gone. Put as much distance between you and here as possible. We don't know each other, we don't talk to each other. Low profile. Two months from today, we'll rendezvous at Bloomington Base. [GUNSHOTS] CHARLlE: Get down! [WOMAN GROANS] Fire! SOLDlER 1: Prepare to fire! SOLDlER 2: Ready! - Fire! Fire! [PANTlNG] Fire! May Christ admit you into his heavenly kingdom. And enjoy the vision of God for... - Who's your best shot? - Trevor. [GUNSHOTS AND GLASS SHATTERlNG] Get up to the roof. Anyone comes within 10 yards, fire. Hurry, before they ram the doors in. Just buy us some time. [GUNSHOTS] Padre. NORA: Charlie. Charlie. [SlGHS] Sam was a sweet kid. But you can't lose it, not now. Now I need your help. [GUNSHOTS AND GLASS SHATTERlNG] SOLDlER 1: Advance! SOLDlER 2: On the door. SOLDlER 3: Someone on the roof! SOLDlER 4: Shooter! [GUNSHOTS] - Fall back! SOLDlER 5: Fall back, fall back! NlCHOLAS: What the hell are you doing? We don't have the proper equipment, shovels or anything. So we'll break the legs off chairs, use kitchen tools, whatever we got. Chair legs? To dig a tunnel? There's a lot of men out there, okay? Sooner or later, they're coming in... ...so we are gonna Shawshank our asses out of here. [SCOFFS] Come on. Go. [GUNSHOT] Sir, your orders? - Send in another man. - Sir, he's cutting us down. And do you know what he is cutting us down with, sergeant? A Marine Corps M40A. And that is the reason it is illegal for citizens to own firearms. Squeezing off five rounds... ...in the amount of time it takes us to load one. Seems to have, heh, a remarkable amount of ammo. But you and I know that bullets are rare. Which means sooner or later, he is going to run out. So let's just try to help him along a little, shall we? Send in another man. Yes, sir. [GUNSHOT] [SOLDlER GRUNTS] Terrific. Anyone trips that, the bleach hits the potassium chloride... ...and they'll end up with their junk in their hands. Literally. Nora, you think you'll be able to beat Monroe? I don't think we're getting out of here alive. You know what I mean. If you do. Probably not. We're too outmanned. But then, why are you here? Yeah, I was with your uncle for a while. But after that, there was Frank. He was sweet. Had no idea who I was, what I could do. One night though, we went for a walk... ...and these drunk militia dicks stopped us. They were getting cute. Frank thought he had to be macho... ...defend my honor or whatever. They were beating him up pretty bad. So I knocked them out cold. I took a few hard shots, but... What happened to Frank? [GUNSHOT IN DlSTANCE] He dumped me. I think he was a little bit scared of me. I don't understand. You told Miles that you joined the rebels over a guy. Yeah. But it wasn't Frank. It wasn't even a guy so much as it was... ...a little boy. I was five months pregnant that night. But the next morning, I wasn't. Oh, God, Nora, I'm so sorry. That's why I'm here, Charlie. Win or lose. Because I had to make it mean something. And if I have another baby... ...it'll be born in the United States. Up and at them, sunshine. You looking for Captain Neville? Sorry, he went into town. It's just you and me. Now, where were we? Oh, yeah. You killed my friend. Now, look, he, uh- - Templeton. - Okay. - Okay, Templeton- - Show him some respect. His name was Templeton. He had a wife. Carol. Huge girl, heh, heh, heh... ...but he loved her. So now I gotta go tell Big Carol what happened. And she's gonna look me in the eye and she's gonna say: "But you got payback, right?" And you know what I'm gonna tell her? "Yes, I did. Again and again. " - Just hold on. - And again. Captain Neville, he wants me alive. Oh, you'll be alive. Don't worry. You'll just wish you weren't. [GRUNTlNG] Miles, we can't do anything, let's just keep walking, okay? How many bodies have we come across? Just like this. I don't understand how things can fall apart so fast. Well, what do you expect, man? People are hungry. - Hungry people get desperate. - Yeah. But this? Ain't nobody coming to help. No one. [GUNSHOT] MlLES: How many rounds do you think he's got left? We'll get out of here. Well, must be nice to have faith. Must make you feel real confident. [GUNSHOT] Unh. Son of a bitch. All wired up. [WOOD CREAKlNG] [GRUNTlNG] NORA: Albert. NlCHOLAS: You got him? Do you got him? [GRUNTlNG] [MlLES PANTlNG] NlCHOLAS: You okay? So, what now? [GUNSHOT] I don't know. Dig it out again, I guess. [GUNSHOTS] [MAN SHOUTlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] And we're out of ammo. This is crazy. We don't have time to dig another tunnel. - What's your brilliant idea? - We fight them off. There's 50 men up there. You cannot stop them. That's what my dad used to say. Every time the soldiers came to our town... ...and they'd take our crops and our women. - I bet he said it when they came for him. - He was trying to protect you. He was being a coward. Don't ever, ever disrespect your dad. Are we clear? [EXPLOSlON] - Trip wire. They're coming in. - We still got men up there. Charlie, wait here. I mean it. [MAN YELLS] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTlNG] [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTlNG] Miles. [BOTH GRUNTlNG] Stay back. Or he's dead. NORA: Move, move, move. MAN: Hurry up, man. MlLES: Lock the door. Nora, rope. What's this about? He's their C.O. We can trade him, his life for ours. Miles. It really is you, isn't it? Who's Miles? You know this guy? Oh, you really don't know, do you? How do you know him? Well, they're gonna find out sooner or later. Go ahead. Tell them. This is Miles Matheson. Commanding general of the Monroe Militia. A damn founding father of the republic... ...second only to Sebastian Monroe himself. He taught me everything I know. Miles? - I ought to slit your throat. - Padre. - Thought you were all about forgiveness. - Christ forgives. I'm not Christ. - You knew this whole time. NlCHOLAS: Wait a minute. You brought Miles Matheson in here on purpose? This is so dramatic. - Do you remember One Life to Live? - Shut up. Look. Be pissed, hate me, do what you gotta do. But we got bigger fish, okay? We trade him, we get out of here. - Won't matter. - Yes, it will. Because like he said, I made the rules. Well, the rules of engagement have changed, kitten. Monroe's done negotiating with traitors. - You're a bad liar. JEREMY: I'm a bad liar? Look me in the eye and tell me I'm a liar. So let me go, don't. I've made peace with my Lord. When my men come in here and cut you up, you'll have to make peace- [GRUNTS] I just- I'm confused. So General Monroe, you know him? I am not talking about this right now. - Well, I think I deserve an explanation. - Really? Do you? Okay. Yeah. I know him. Very well. You were in charge of the whole militia? Been a few years, but, yep. You murdered people's fathers, dragged away their brothers. Yes, Charlie. I killed fathers and sons and husbands and- Is that what you wanna know? You happy? Do not talk to me that way. I am just trying to understand what's going on. Well... ...now you know. Now you know why the militia cannot be stopped... ...because they're mine. I trained them. And they are brutal and smart and vicious... ...because of me. That's why your dad was right. When you see them coming, you don't fight. You run. MAGGlE: Any progress? - No. Pretty much a sucking black hole of nothing. I found some supplies. Salt, curry. That's great. Oh, that's great. Oh, and curry...? Great. - You're frustrated. - Frustrated? "Frustrated" doesn't even scratch it. What is all of this crap? And what is this ugly-ass thing even for? - Why did Ben even give it to me? - Aaron. It's like Lucy yanking some enormous, cosmic football... ...just as Charlie Brown's about to kick it. I'll be downstairs. SOLDlER 1: Ready! SOLDlER 2: Watch it. [THUDDlNG] SOLDlER 3: Again! SOLDlER 4: Try something else! NlCHOLAS: Look, Nora. We just don't have a choice. - That's your plan? NlCHOLAS: Listen. We charge out that door, half of us won't make it. Half is better than none. - Now, if you have a better idea- - It's easy to have a better idea... ...because that idea is awful. - I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you. - Take it easy, your holiness. - I'm about to save your sorry asses. - Miles, how? We make a trade. So... You let these people go, I'll turn myself in. - What? - To you. Miles, no. That's a good deal, right? I bet you'd get a parade for this. Hmm. I want that rifle. The one you were taking potshots at us with. Done. What makes you think he'll keep his side? I've known this guy for much longer than I've known any of you. He'll keep his word. Yeah, and what about your word? Can't find Danny if you're dead. All right. Let's go. [MEN SHOUTlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] They're gonna kill him. He's a war criminal. And aren't you a priest? Doesn't change what he's done. Sorry. I can only pray that the Lord will have mercy on his soul. [COUGHlNG] Hey, man. So just you and me. What do you want to do? - Leave me alone. - You're not still upset about before? - I don't want any... - What? I can't hear you. - No, no, no. - Look, stop screwing around. I have asthma, I have asthma. I need... [DANNY WHEEZlNG AND COUGHlNG] Hey, hey, hey. Quit it. Hey, hey. Hey, Captain Neville-? [GRUNTlNG] You touch me again, and I'll kill you. I'll kill you! You understand me? [GASPlNG] Do you? [COUGHlNG] JEREMY: Miles. It's me. You can level with me. Is it true? Is what true? Well, the rumor is... ...Monroe wants you because you know something about flipping the lights on. It's crazy, right? - What do you think? - Oh, I think it's crazy. I think Monroe's obsessed. It's sort of worrisome. I'll tell you something else. He hasn't been the same since you left. - Yeah? - Yeah. He's angrier. Shorter fuse, you know? Not like the good old days. [NElGHlNG] [SOLDlERS SCREAMlNG AND GRUNTlNG] [GRUNTlNG] Come on. [MAN GRUNTlNG] Miles, no. Come on, man, let's just keep walking. You don't have to come. MlLES: Get away from him. This ain't none of your business. - I said get away from him. - Whoa, whoa, hey. Take it easy. Here. Look. - I would just get the hell out of here. - No. Do not move. Miles? Look, man, I'm sorry. We're just trying to find something to eat. That couple back up the road. In the orange tent. Yeah, that was you. Thought so. We can't call the cops. - Can't put them in jail. MONROE: Miles, Miles. This is over. [GUNSHOT] What did you just do? There's nobody else coming to help. It's just us out here. So you're gonna walk around wasting guys- Somebody's gotta do something. Or else there's gonna be nothing left. Hey. Mister, you all right? Thank you. You saved my life. [JEREMY GROANlNG] All right, let's hear it. Hear what? Tell me I'm a monster. That I'm garbage. Miles Matheson, general of the militia. - Come on, I wanna hear you say it. - I'm not gonna say it. MlLES: Why not? - Because I don't think it. Yes, you do. How can you not? - You don't understand, Charlie. - So tell me. I wanna understand. No, you really don't. Well, fact is, you still saved all those people back there. So obviously there's a part of you that still gives a crap. You're wrong. AARON: You wanna hear a joke? - Sorry? - You'll love it. All right, uh, there was this kid, Billy Underwood. Beat me up every day on the playground... ...in fifth grade. Wedgies, especially. Kid was, like, the Mozart of wedgies. And I swore that things would get better. And they did. I grew up... ...and, heh, I got 300 employees... ...and, heh, four homes and a wife... ...who didn't care about any of it, in the best possible way. And the punch line was the blackout. [SlGHS] When the world went back... ...to being one giant school yard. And the Billy Underwoods are in charge... ...and I am weak and afraid. [WHlRRlNG] What is that? - Aaron. - Oh, my God. [AARON CHUCKLES] [MARVlN GAYE'S "HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVlNE" PLAYS ON HEADPHONES] Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew 'Bout your plans to make me blue It's music. It's Marvin Gaye, heh. It took me by surprise, I must say When I found out yesterday Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine [CHUCKLES] Oh, I heard it through the- [MUSlC STOPS] [SlGHS] How? I don't know. [English - US - SDH]
