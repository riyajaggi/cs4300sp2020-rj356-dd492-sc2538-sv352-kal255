 Revolution (2012â€“2014): Season 1, Episode 9 - Kashmir - full transcript 
 Having reached the outskirts of Philadelphia, Miles manages to convince the rebels that he can deliver Monroe's head to them. They agree to work with him and are soon traveling through the city's subway system to get into town. They begin to hallucinate when their oxygen supply thins out. They also have to deal with a traitor in their midst. Charlie learns why Miles left the militia. Rachel has agreed to build an amplifier that will expand the power and range of the pendants. Major Neville begins to doubt her sincerity and has a way to test what she's doing.

 NARRATOR: We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. Previously, on Revolution:

 - Danny's gone. - You're gonna come with me. - I can't. - Please. This is Miles Matheson, commanding general of the militia. - General Monroe. You know him. - Yeah. Very well. MlLES: You joined the rebels? - To bring back the United States. AARON: I had a wife. I couldn't protect her. - Aaron! Philadelphia. You coming? We get across that bridge, straight shot to Danny. You wanna turn the power back on. It starts with these pendants. Most of your colleagues are not where you said. We did manage to find one, Doctor Bradley Jaffe. What will happen if Monroe figures out that necklace? - All he cares about is weapons. - With my compliments. So now you have everything you need.

 I told you. I'm a rebel from the St. Anne unit. Only thing I know is you got a flag tattoo and you walked in with Miles Matheson. To make you a deal. Just hear him out. [GRUNTlNG] [COUGHS] [CHUCKLlNG] I'm Colonel Starkey. This is Sergeant Wheatley. Colonel and sergeant. That's cute... ...how you rebel guys use military titles. [CHUCKLES] You got a pair of brass ones. I mean, the commanding general of the Monroe militia... ...walking in here? Retired commanding general. Tell me why I shouldn't execute you and all your friends right now. Because... ...I'm gonna hand you General Monroe's head on a plate. And just why would you do that? He's holding somebody prisoner in Philly. It's my nephew. And there's only a handful of places they could be keeping him. And every single one of them, impossible to break into. I need help. - Your rebel camp is the only help around. - Right. That's just what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna send my men with you. - No. - Sir? [WHEATLEY & STARKEY WHlSPERlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] Okay. Let's say we did this... ...go on a suicide raid for your nephew, and you give us Monroe in return. - How would you do it exactly? - Well... ...I know his office inside and out. I know what he eats, I know where he eats, I know the women he bangs. I can put you right in front of him, and you know I can. Why should we believe you? Let's just say for a second that I'm telling you the truth... ...and that I can get you a clean shot at Monroe. How do you pass that up? You look terrible. It's part of the charm. We're in. We go tomorrow night. [MlLES COUGHS] MlLES: Hey. CHARLlE: Hey. Maybe you should take it easy with that. Why would I do that? It's a big day tomorrow. [CHUCKLlNG] What? - Nothing. Forget it. - No. Just say it. Come on. Well, you gotta be realistic, Charlie. Odds are we're gonna die tomorrow. Yeah, well, you'll figure it out. You always do. What makes you so sure I know what I'm doing? What makes you so sure I ever did? What if Monroe's in our way? Huh? What if I gotta go face-to-face with him? What then? What do you mean? Uh... Never mind. Miles. Miles. [SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY] You got this? [GRUNTlNG] Yeah, I think so. This is the only way? MlLES: The walls around Philly are 30 feet high with machine-gun nests. We can't go over. We gotta go under. Lead the way, general. NORA: Just watch your step. The militia's got these tunnels rigged with traps. Hey. What? I know the colonel wanted to kill me... ...and I know you talked him into this, so thanks. You know, I used to be a gambler. Atlantic City, mostly. Indian casinos, online poker. I was a little sketchy, to tell you the truth. But gambling, it teaches you to always play the odds. I figure, best case, you give us Monroe. Worst case, this is a trap, but I still manage to put a bullet in your brain. Win-win. So you were with Miles when he was general, right? Yeah. What was he like? I mean, he and Monroe, what were they like together? Why would you ask that? Miles said something about Monroe last night, and I just need to know. They were best friends. Grew up together. Enlisted together. If they were so close then why'd Miles leave the militia? Probably because he tried to assassinate Monroe. That tends to drive a wedge between friends. What happened? Miles couldn't pull the trigger. Couldn't go through with it. Like I said, they were best friends. [CLlCKS] Don't move. Everybody freeze. Stop where you are. It's a mine. Charlie, listen to me. Don't move a muscle. [LED ZEPPELlN'S "SlNCE I'VE BEEN LOVlNG YOU" PLAYlNG ON STEREO] [WHlRRlNG] TOM: Mrs. Matheson. [TOM SlGHS] I never thought I'd hear music like that again. What can I do for you, major? I'd like to introduce you to Captain Burke. I was hoping that you'd explain to him what this machine you're building does. Major, I really don't have time to go through all of this again. The lives of Captain Burke and his men, boys as young as Danny... ...may depend on this gadget you're building. So I'm afraid I have to insist. - Captain. - Ma'am. This pendant powers up anything within its range. It's like a wireless battery. But the real problem is it has very limited range... ...only nine or 10 feet. Enough to power... [STEREO TURNS OFF] ...a CD player... [STEREO TURNS BACK ON] ...or a computer... [STEREO TURNS OFF] [STEREO TURNS BACK ON] ...but for vehicles, weapons... ...you need a booster. An amplifier. You plug the pendant into this port here. It amplifies the range to half a mile. Flips on tanks, jets, missiles, as long as they're within range. When will it be ready? You mean, when will you have the ability to murder thousands of people? Soon. I'd like to get back to work now. I've been trying Lord, let me tell Let me tell you I really did the best I could [SPRAY PAlNT CAN HlSSlNG] You said you knew where all the traps were. Militia must have put these in after I left. NORA: It's all clear ahead of this batch. Now get out of here before you blow yourselves up. You guys too. I'm not going anywhere. Me neither. - Get out of here, you're gonna get killed. NORA: Stop talking. If you're stupid enough to stay here, hold this. [PANTlNG] [EXHALES] - I think I got it. - Yeah? You sure? No. Sometimes there's another mine underneath. A trap under the trap. So you're gonna step off... ...and if we don't get blown to bits, we're gonna run like hell, okay? Good luck, everyone. Okay. Ready? Now! [CLlCKlNG] Aaron, by the way. - Ashley. - Nice to meet you. Despite the, you know... ...hellish circumstances. - Can I ask you something, Ashley? - Yeah. You're, uh, what, 19? And you're fighting for the United States? Yeah. Do you even remember the United States? No. But I remember what my dad told me. He was from Syria. He left because he didn't want his kids to grow up scared in their own country. I'm doing this for him. How come you're fighting Monroe? That's funny, I- Heh. Until right this second, it never occurred to me that I was... ...but you're right, I guess I am. Huh. - Miles? - What is it? Stay back. Stay back. Hold that. He went in there. I just- I saw him. Who? A militia scout. He went right in there. There's no one in there, Miles. Well, he couldn't have just vanished into thin air. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. Well, this is the only safe way through. Come on. [GASPS] [PANTlNG] [SHRlEKS] NORA: Help! My leg! - It bit my leg! It bit my leg! - Nora. Nora. - What bit your leg? - The alligator. Alligator? There's no alligator. Here. Nora. Look. Look at your leg. It's fine. That didn't happen? Oh, my God, this makes sense. - How does this make sense? - You saw an alligator that wasn't there. You saw a scout that wasn't there. You were hallucinating. - Why are we hallucinating? - Because we're running out of air. The torches are all burning low because they're not getting enough oxygen. When the tunnel collapsed, it sealed the air supply off. So we're suffocating? And I'm pretty sure that if we're suffocating... ...then hallucinations are the last things that are gonna happen before we die. How far to this exit of yours, Matheson? Uh... Girard Station. It's 10 minutes away. Let's go. Aaron, you seeing something? No. You sure? Yeah. I'm fine. There's nothing there. Come on. The stairs are up this way. Damn it. - Militia, they sealed off the exit. CHARLlE: When? A month ago. A year ago. Does it matter? What do we do now? I don't know, let me... Let me think. We gotta keep moving, find a way out. How far to the next exit? I don't know. This is the one they were supposed to keep open for access. - There's gotta be another. MlLES: There isn't. Well, we gotta try. She's right. We're dead if we just sit here. Let's go. CHARLlE: Miles? Hey. Hey. Come on. [LED ZEPPELlN'S "KASHMlR" PLAYlNG FAlNTLY ON STEREO] [MUSlC GROWS LOUDER] Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face Stars to fill my dream I am a traveler of both time and space To be where I have been Sit with elders of a gentle race This world has seldom seen They talk of days for which they sit and wait When all will be revealed Am I, uh...? - Am I hallucinating? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. You look like hell warmed over. And not just because you're suffocating. You have gone to seed, my friend. Yeah. Well... ...things haven't been so easy. You look tired, brother. I am tired, Bass. So was it worth it? Leaving the militia? Trying to kill me? - Why did you do it, Miles? - You went too far. It just got to be so much blood. Yet you still regret it. There's a part of you, big part... ...that wishes you could just take it all back. No, you're wrong. [CHUCKLES] Miles, you're forgetting. This is not real. I'm in your head. I know what you're thinking. I know your dirty little secret, the one you don't wanna tell Charlie or Nora. What secret is that? That if I'd take you back... ...you just might do it. You just might sell out your friends... ...fall straight back into line. Right beside me. You're scared, Miles. You're scared it's gonna happen. CHARLlE: Miles. Miles. Were you seeing things? What? No. Just fell behind. Let's go. You were talking to Monroe. I heard you. Okay, cut me some slack. Yeah, I'm seeing things. I'm also choking to death. - You can't do this. - What? Fall apart. We won't make it without you. We'll die down here and we'll never get to Danny. Look, I'm sorry. I know you didn't ask for this. But I'm counting on you. We all are. So pull it together. Let's go. Aaron? Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm fine. PRlSClLLA: Aaron? Why won't you talk to me? I'm your wife, I love you. You love me. Don't you? Please, just look at me. Why did you leave me? You left because you couldn't protect me. Because you're weak? A coward? But look at you. You've been strong for Charlie. On this whole trip, you've been strong. So why couldn't you be that strong for me? You broke my heart. But maybe you don't care. Maybe you never really loved me. That's not true. What? Nothing. PRlSClLLA: Aaron. Aaron, what am I supposed to do without you? Aaron. Wait, you see that? The torch is burning again. Means there's gotta be fresh air somewhere. Wait, that door. It could be a service tunnel to the outside, maybe. I thought all these doors were sealed off down here. Take this. MlLES: Let me try. [GRUNTlNG] [WlND WHlSTLlNG] - We're getting out of here. - Some of us are. Back. [GRUNTlNG] Uh-uh. Monroe's gonna want you alive. You're militia? That's right, general. And I'm taking you home. [GRUNTlNG] Up, please. Keep your hands where I can see them. You don't remember me, do you? Heh-heh. I was so afraid you were gonna make me. Two years of deep cover down the drain. The Trenton campaign. You pinned a medal on me. Hell, I was proud, I was damn proud. General Miles Matheson shook my hand. AARON: Here, here, here. - Aaron. You knew that service door was there the whole time. Also knew the Girard exit was sealed. I know these tunnels well. Better than you, obviously. It's how I report back to command. Once I saw your pretty face, I knew Monroe would want you more than anything. Figured it was worth blowing my cover for. Wasn't sure if I could pull it off, but, like I said, I'm a gambler. Always play the odds. All right, up this way. Keep moving. [CLANGlNG] [GROANS] [WATER DRlPPlNG] Dad? Hey. Nice of you to join us, Sleeping Beauty. What's wrong? This isn't real. I'm dreaming. Ow. Well, you look awake to me. Now do me a favor, tell Maggie and Danny dinner's ready. Dad... I thought you... What? Militia killed you. They took Danny and Maggie died. Was I dreaming? It felt so real. It's all over. You're home. And you don't ever have to leave again. - Dad, tell me you're not going anywhere. - No. Of course not. You okay? My head. Why don't you lie back? Come on. Just close your eyes, Charlie. MlLES: Just open your eyes. BEN: Just close your eyes. MlLES: Charlie. Open your eyes. Charlie. Hey. Wake up. Open your eyes. Come on, open them. Open your eyes. Come on, I need you to open- Open your eyes. I don't understand, the bullet just grazed her head. She cracked her head when she fell. Between that and the oxygen loss... MlLES: Charlie. Come on. Just- Hey. I am going to get Danny back. I promise. You can count on me, okay? But I need you... ...to open your- Just open your eyes. Okay? Damn it, Charlie, just open your eyes. Come on, open them! Open your eyes, Charlie. Come on. Open your eyes. Did you hear that? Hear what? I know that voice. MlLES: Charlie, come on. It's Uncle Miles. What made you think of Uncle Miles? You haven't seen him since you were a kid. That's not true. I went to Chicago. You sent me there. To get Miles so that I could get Danny back. That's what's real. I'm dreaming. All right, just sit down. You're tired. You need to rest. I want to. You have no idea how much I want to. But I gotta get Danny. [SlGHS] I love you, Dad. I want you to know how much I love you. I think about you every day. Please, Charlie, don't go. I'm sorry. I have to. MlLES: Come on. [EXHALES] Hey, kid. You okay? [EXHALES] How's your head? Well, if he aimed half an inch to the right, I think it'd be pretty bad. I'm fine. I think we should stay the night here, get you back on your feet. You've made me sit three hours already. I've spent enough time down here, believe me. You saved me. Not really. You got shot. I heard you calling for me. I was... I was somewhere else. And it was really hard to leave. If it wasn't for you, I probably would've stayed. So thank you. You have any idea what's on the other side of that door? Probably walking straight into a militia ambush. Well, that will be par for the course, at least. You ready to do this? Are you? Not really. But what the hell, huh? Evening, Rachel. Kind of busy here, Bass. Right. The machine, the amplifier. As you explained to Major Neville and Captain Burke. Yes. And this machine, it, uh... It amplifies the range of the pendant. What is this about, Bass? You know, Major Neville is an invaluable member of my team. His instincts, his little hunches about people. They are almost never wrong. He had a little hunch about what you're doing here, Rachel. So we brought in a second opinion. One of your old colleagues. You remember Dr. Jaffe? - He's graciously agreed to work with us. RACHEL: Brad. Brad. Dr. Jaffe, could you please take a look at this machine? Tell us what it can do. It's an amplifier. Brad. - It's a bomb. - You're lying. I'm sorry, Rachel, but I know what I'm looking at. Pretty sophisticated time bomb. The pendant acts like an electric trigger. I'd imagine she'd set it to go off when you were here but she wasn't. - No. - No? Listen to me. Listen to me. What did you think was gonna happen, Rachel? - Listen to me. - You were gonna kill me? Escape with Danny in the chaos? We had a deal. And I kept my end of the bargain, but now it's over. I will build you another amplifier. There is a lot about the necklace- - You are dead! - No! And Danny is dead. You need me. I need you? No, Rachel. I don't need you. I have Dr. Jaffe. I have his pendant. And he's been a hell of a lot more cooperative than you've ever been. - Bass. - No, Rachel. This is over. I don't need you anymore. Get her out of here. [BRADLEY GRUNTlNG] Bradley, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [PANTlNG] Now you need me. [English - US - SDH]
