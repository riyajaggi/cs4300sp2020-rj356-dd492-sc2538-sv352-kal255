 Revolution (2012â€“2014): Season 1, Episode 6 - Sex and Drugs - full transcript 
 Miles, Charlie and Aaron are en route to Philadelphia with an unconscious Nora whose knife wound from the train incident has festered and is in dire need of medical help. Miles decides to stop off at a former partner's armed compound to get Nora the help she needs. His friend Drexel is a heroin dealer who loves to play mind games. He provides Nora with the help that she needs but demands that Charlie kill a neighbor, O'Halloran, who has taken to burning his poppy crops. Charlie has become overly cynical and agrees to do the job despite Miles' objections. In Philadelphia meanwhile, Danny is safely delivered to Bass Monroe and Captain Tom Neville is appropriately rewarded for having delivered him safely. Rachel and a stunned Danny are reunited.

 MILES: We lived in an electric world. We relied on it for everything. And then the power went out. Everything stopped working. We weren't prepared. Fear and confusion led to panic. The lucky ones made it out of the cities. The government collapsed. Militias took over... ...controlling the food supply and stockpiling weapons. We still don't know why the power went out. But we're hopeful that someone will come and light the way. NARRATOR: Previously on Revolution: If you wanna turn the power back on, it starts with these pendants. There are 12 of them.

 I had 300 employees, four homes and a wife who didn't care about any of that. BEN: There is nothing worth seeing, not anymore. Hello, Mother. It's good to be home. And Monroe, with a working train, makes him dangerous. Hutch, it's you and me, we're gonna blow up that train. AARON: What if Danny is on board? - Damn it. Gotta get that bomb off. - What's wrong? Nora. [BOTH SCREAMlNG] TOM: Bring her to me. That's an order. Aah! - I have to do it. - Get out- Uhn! Hyah! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop!

 [HORSE NElGHlNG] [GROANlNG] - She was all right. It was just a little cut. - Cuts get infected. - How far away are we? - Five hours. Maybe six. - Five hours? Miles- - It's the closest help that I know, Aaron. [GROANlNG] AARON: Hey, Charlie. It's gonna be okay. - It's gonna be okay? Really? - Yeah. What? It's this insane lie that people tell each other to cope or something. - Charlie. CHARLlE: It's never okay. Look at Nora. Look at what happened to Daniel on the train. And what about Maggie? You couldn't save her, Aaron. - Say it was gonna be okay then? - That's enough. What the hell's gotten into you? [PRlSClLLA CHUCKLES] - Happy anniversary. - Hmm. - So where you taking me? - I'm sorry. That's privileged information. - What if I didn't pack the right clothes? - Then you won't wear clothes. [LAUGHlNG] You know, you don't have to do all this. It's too much. It's just a weekend trip. - On the company jet. - What can I say? It's just one of the countless perks of being married to me. [ELECTRlClTY POWERlNG DOWN] Hey, Ted, what's happening? [PRlSClLLA SCREAMS] MONROE: Danny Matheson. I knew your father. And I'm sorry about what happened. That is not how I wanted things to work out. Believe me. Captain Neville will be dealt with. I see your mother in you. You knew my mother? MONROE: Take him back to his room, please. And Danny. Just remember, you're my guest. Anything you want... ...food, women. Anything, just ask. Okay? Sir, I apologize for the mess with Ben Matheson. I didn't mean for the man to die. Drop the formalities, Tom. We've been friends too long for that. I'm promoting you to major. How would you like to head up Intelligence and Interrogations? You've been angling for that job for years. Now it's yours, if you want it. Julia will be happy to have me home. [HORSE NElGHlNG] [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER] MlLES: Whoa. This is private property. Turn around. Tell Drexel Miles Matheson needs to see him now. He's gonna be pissed if you don't. - Those are poppies. - Yep. Heroin in the raw. - Drexel supplies half the Republic. - So why are his fields extra crispy? - I don't know. - And this is a friend of yours? I said he could help Nora. Didn't said he was a friend. GUARD: Open the gate. Come on! Let's move. Move. Watch her. Watch her head. Easy. Easy. Miles Matheson, you son of a bitch. [GUNS COCKlNG] You have a lot of nerve, showing your face around here. Look, Drexel, my friend's sick. She needs a doctor. Turn around. On your knees. - Turn around. - All right. Okay. You're first. - What are you doing, buddy? - On the count of three. One... ...two... - Drexel! - ... three! - Drexel! - Three! [GUN CLlCKS] You should see the look on your face. [CHUCKLlNG] Get up. Come on. It's all fun and games. Can't you take a joke? Yeah. It's hilarious. Put your hands down. Put them down. Put them down. Everybody in the house. Oh, uh, your weapons. House rules. Okay, so the doc is down in the lab. I have rooms for you two upstairs. Wine? Hot baths? Oh. Well, we'd like to stick together, if it's all the same to you. Ooh. You're turning down my hospitality? Like I'm some kind of schmuck? No. He's not. He's grateful. - Aren't you, Aaron? - No- Yes! I am sorry. I'll go with Nora. You two, be grateful. Sure. I'm really glad you brought us here. DREXEL: So good. You'll have to excuse me. I'm gonna go bury myself in tail. [CHUCKLES] - Okay. Okay, okay. PRlSClLLA: Yeah. [PRlSClLLA GROANlNG] Aaron, I'm sick. AARON: Don't worry. We just need to get out of the city. - Okay? Careful, careful. - Let me lie down. AARON: Okay. Easy, easy. Oh, God. [GROANlNG] What is it? What can I do? What can I do? [GROANlNG] [CLATTERlNG] I'm not gonna hurt you. My name is Sean. What's wrong with her? It's her stomach. She can't hold anything down. She drank from the lake? Maybe. Yeah, I think so. Probably dysentery. Okay, okay, okay. SEAN: Sewage pumps stopped working. It all flowed into the lake. You gotta be more careful. What's this? It's penicillin. We grow it, homemade. You know your blood type? - O-negative. - Lucky for you, sweetheart. Universal donor. Lie down. Clock's ticking. Your girlfriend is in septic shock. What we need to do is freshen the pipes. [WATER FLOWlNG] RACHEL: I love you. Mom! Don't go! Please! Don't go. CHARLlE: I'm gonna come with... BEN: You're so strong. Like your mom. Please, don't go, Maggie. Maggie! RACHEL: Protect your brother. Protect your brother. [TRAlN HORN BLARlNG] JASON: General. Major. At ease. This is a fine report, lieutenant. Thank you, sir. I found it a little light myself. On the part where you were held by that group of traitors? - Especially the pretty Matheson girl. - The report's complete, sir. MONROE: Tom, go easy on the kid. You mentioned here a woman, Nora and Miles. Is she Latin? Yes, sir. Nora Clayton. I'll bet they make quite the pair. Just one more thing, lieutenant. Did you ever see something like this? It's a necklace or a pendant. We think the girl might have one. Not the girl. The fat guy has it. Thank you, lieutenant. Dismissed. Get Strausser. Give him last known whereabouts. Sir? Lieutenant, you've been dismissed. It's just that Strausser isn't really known to leave survivors, sir. Strausser's gonna bring us the necklace. And Miles. We don't need anyone else. Dismissed. Sir. STRAUSSER: Would you like to hear the best advice I ever got? You need the right tool for the right job. Learned that from my father. He was a butcher by trade. And he didn't use any fancy bolt guns or electric saws they had before the Blackout. No. He was an artist. He'd slice a carcass from stem to stern in one swing. And then, he'd go about carving through muscle and bone... ...like brushstrokes on a canvas. It was something to see. TOM: Sergeant Strausser. STRAUSSER: Sir. Got a little job for you. - How is she? - Doc says 50-50. What are you doing? Packing. We're gonna load her back on that wagon. Get going after Danny. I don't think we should stay here... ...a second longer than we have to. You've seen Drexel. See me do what? Oh, leaving so soon? Doc did a hell of a job. So thanks. I mean it, and I owe you one. You owe me one. Right. Did Miles ever tell you how we know each other? Hmm? It was back when he was general of the militia. And you should have seen him. He'd ordered men in front of a firing squad... ...the way you and I would've ordered a beer. And I loved him for it. He was my guy. He helped me eliminate my competition. And in return, I lined his war chest with so much gold you could dive in and swim. Of course, then he deserted. And because I was on Team Miles... ...I was unfairly tainted... ...as if I was a scumbag traitor too. So like you said... ...you owe me. For so many things. Come with me. [DREXEL SlGHS] DREXEL: Mm. You know how much these poppies were worth? Up in smoke. What, somebody torched them? Yeah. Drunk Irish family up the road. The O'Hallorans. Why? What'd you do to piss them off? Nothing. Honestly. They just have a problem with heroin. - Can you believe that? - Yeah, Drexel. I can believe that. So what's the big deal? Why don't you handle them yourself? Believe me, I have tried. But it is harder than you think. Potato-eating leprechaun bastards. Okay. I'll take care of them. But then, we are even. That is so kind of you. But no, thanks. I don't want you to do it. I want her. Her? No, no that's not happening. You won't be able to get in. But she will, easily. I said I'll kill them. That's it. That's all you get. You can't. She can. And if she doesn't, I'm gonna start by smothering Latina Barbie... ...then the rest of you, one by one. - I'd like to see you try, you son of a bitch. - Hey, hey, hey! I'll do it. This is my fault. I got you into this, but you are not walking out that door. How are we gonna get out of here? How are we gonna get Nora out? If I don't do this, you all die. So you're just gonna kill some random dude. So what? I've done it before. How are you talking like this? Who the hell are you? - Aaron- - This isn't some militia soldier. The only thing these people are doing is torching Drexel's heroin. We should be sending them a fruit basket. Not killing them. Charlie... ...they are innocent. This is murder. I don't have a choice! How many times do you want me to say that? You're the one always telling me to toughen up. And you're right. The world is not a bunch of pretty postcards. [DOOR OPENS] Ah. Good. Perfect. Huh? Ooh. Just the right amount of biscuit. So the head of the family, his name is Bill O'Halloran. Those guys are gonna search you, so put this in your hair. Get him alone. And then shove this in his eye. Now, my guys can get you close. Tell them that you are one of my regular girls and you've got the goods on me. Because I've been roughing you up all the time... ...and you're sick of it. Got it? - What do you mean roughing me up? - Oh... Oh, you're right. They'll never buy it. MlLES: Charlie! DREXEL: There. That's better. Huh? Now he'll take you in like a lost little kitten. Did you have something you wanna say to me, tough guy? [PANTS] [DOOR CLOSES] SEAN: Run. The bandits are coming. [MEN SHOUTlNG] MAN: Get everybody. Come on! SEAN: Come on, man. - Come on, Aaron. Hurry. Hurry! - I'm trying. I'm trying. Just go! - Just go. Just go! PRlSClLLA: Aah! Where you going, sweetheart? - Hey! PRlSClLLA: Aah! [ALL GRUNTlNG] PRlSClLLA: Aaron! Aaron! Aaron! [SCREAMS] [BONES CRACKlNG] [PANTlNG] You guys okay? PRlSClLLA: We're okay, Sean. AARON: I've known that girl since she was in pigtails. And she can be a pain in the ass. And stubborn. But she's- What do you want me to do? There's 30 guards here. And instead of Nora... - ... I got you. - Screw you, Miles. DREXEL: Here. Catch. - What's this? - For your trouble. And burial expenses for the girl. Excuse me? Well, yeah. If she kills O'Halloran, his family's gonna be just a little pissed. She's not getting out of there alive. Come on, Miles. It's just fun and games. Anyway, now we're square. AARON: Okay, okay. Okay, listen to me. If it's just you, then you can get out, and you can go after her- If I go, you and Nora are dead. If you don't go, then Charlie is dead. Look, I will do the best that I can here, which I realize isn't much. But you have to choose between us and Charlie. I am asking you to choose Charlie. She is your family. And she is pretty much my family too. It's not gonna be easy to get out of here alive, you know that. Um... Just take care of the guy at the door. I have an idea. [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER] What do you want? Bill O'Halloran. Can I see him? Uncle Bill? What for? I was one of Drexel's girls, okay? Tell your uncle I have something on Drexel. Something good. Yeah, sorry. Nobody sees him but family. Well, that's too bad. Make sure you tell your uncle you're the one who let me walk away. Stop. Search her. I need help! Come on, man. Something's wrong. You gotta come this way. [GRUNTS] This will take you straight down to the kitchen. - How do you know? - My house had three of them. Hey, whatever happens... Just try and take care of Nora. [GRUNTlNG] [KNOCKlNG ON DOOR] BlLL: Come in. Wait here. BlLL: There you go. Would you look at this? Look at this. [WOMAN CHUCKLES] Hey, Uncle Bill. We got one of Drexel's girls out there. Bring her in. Hey, you take the little man. Grandma is gonna take you. - I wanna talk to this girl, okay? - You think she knew Becca. We'll find out. Okay? [BABY BABBLlNG] BlLL: Sorry. Uh... Heh. Grandkids got me wrapped around their little fingers. Can I get you something to drink? Some tea? Something stronger? No, thank you. You were a policeman? Before the blackout, most of us were. Fathers, sons, cousins. What's your name? Sarah. What you planning on doing with that, Sarah? It's- It's just for my hair. Was that your wife in here? Yes. - She asked if I knew Becca? - Rebecca, our daughter. Uh... One day, she ran away over to Drexel's. She thought it was, I don't know, glamorous. Hell, heroin's legal these days. What did she know? Drexel put her in a dress just like that. Put a needle in her arm... ...and that was that. He was nice enough to send the body home. Well, don't worry. By the time I'm done with Drexel... ...he won't be hurting any more girls like you or Becca. [GRUNTS] I don't know... ...Miles left you holding the bag? What kind of friend is that? Look, if you wanna take this out on me, that's fine. But let Nora go. She doesn't have anything to do with this. Not yet. But she's about to. Leave her alone. Come on. She should join the party too. Give her her booster, doc. - What is that? - Pure adrenaline. [GASPlNG] Nora. Nora. Are you gonna shoot us? No, Chubs. You're gonna shoot each other. So... ...what do you wanna tell me about your boss? I think I'd like that tea now. Sure. [CRYlNG] I'm sorry. I don't have a choice. Please forgive me. We're leaving, Charlie. Now. NORA: Aaron, what the hell did Miles get us into? Kind of a long story. Forget it. We are not doing this. Come on. It's just fun and games. This game is about survival. Whoever shoots the other one first and kills them wins. And the winner stays alive. I promise. Or you could refuse to play... ...and I'll shoot you both. Your call. - Let me help. - I've got it. - Aaron. - I said I got it. I can do one damn thing by myself. I can make a fire. I'm sorry. Aaron, it's all right. It used to be I spent a good part of my day... ...trying to figure out how to give you everything. But now? Now I can't give you anything. I can't hunt for food. And I can't keep you safe. I can't even build a damn fire. None of that matters to me. It never did. You're the only thing that matters to me. What happened today... What if it happens again? Now, don't get any funny ideas about shooting me... ...because this baby is armored. Ready? On three. - One. - I'm not going to shoot you. Two. But I want you to shoot me. What? Three! Go ahead and shoot. - You're crazy. - Come on. Miles and Charlie need you. Nobody needs me. I can't help anyone. You can help get Danny. Please. Nora. Or he'll kill us both. Aaron. No. What are you doing? Aaron! [GUNSHOT] Aaron. [AARON GRUNTlNG] Does anybody know how many bullets this psycho put in this gun? Because I sure don't. Please. I just- I just want to get her... ...and my other friends... ...and get out of here alive. That's it. Please. Grab your crap and go. Now. CHARLlE: Hey. MlLES: What the hell happened? How did you get away? You okay? - What happened? - Aaron shot the son of a bitch. MlLES: Aaron? Shot Drexel? This Aaron? I think I broke a rib, but yeah. Ow. What about you, did you do it? No. Good. So everything turned out okay. Aaron. Aaron! [INDlSTlNCT CHATTER] I don't understand. I thought that Monroe wanted to see me? Orders are to bring you here. Danny. Mom? Look at you. [LAUGHS] [RACHEL CRYlNG] It's okay. [English - US - SDH]
