 They're often left with no accesses or information. What's this? Oh... Mitch! There are no more masks! We can't keep doing this! Oh hey, Mike. Need a mask? I made these. Thanks, Bobby, you're amazing. Ah! Stupid face shield! The airbag didn't deploy. Ah, it was probably in an accident, someone sold it to her cheap. Her head hit the steering wheel? Yeah, she wasn't wearing her seatbelt. There's blood around her nose. The steering wheel is bedazzled. There is bruising on her arm. Her name's "Roberta Almeda." At least we have an address. Pop the trunk for me. Yeah. I know you. All right. Yeah, yeah. All right, let me know. - What's that? - Brownie mix. She's got a trunk full of it. What are you looking for? Receipt. She paid for all this at 8:53 last night. So she's shopping so she can Covid-bake and then... What? Somebody attacks her and she tries to get away, and slams into a pole? Well, it could be carjacking. We didn't, we didn't find a purse. She had a... a debit card in her pocket. Never a carjacking when you want it to be. She was a frontline worker. She's got bruises on her nose and cheekbones. All right. Let me know what the autopsy says. Hey! Is your leg still bugging you? No. ♪ O mio babbino caro ♪ ♪ mi piace è bello, bello ♪ - Hey. - Hey. She was a healthcare worker. One of us. Does she look familiar to you? I mean, I feel like I've seen her before, I just, I can't, I can't place her. No. The mechanism of death is exsanguination. She bled out? - From her nose. Her skull is cracked. This is a terrible death for a young woman. She's got a bandaid on her forehead. She has bruising on her arms. There's a small deep cut. I mean, maybe it's domestic abuse. He followed her to the parking lot and attacked her there? - Hmm... - What? I'm not the most experienced bedazzler, but this looks like a real jewel. Oh... well... How did that get in there? I don't know, but I think our girl was a rare gem. Uh, yeah, I need to make an appointment about my foot. I busted it last year. McAvoy, yeah. Donovan. That's great. All right, thanks. Think fast! Found these in Bobby Almeda's apartment, along with a hamster wearing a homemade sweater. She was a PSW. Worked in six different nursing homes in the GTA. That's a no-no. Yeah, you can't be spreading your germs all over old people. Which one was she working at last? Uh, Linden tree long-term care. - Did she have a partner? - No. Single. Hi there. I'm detective McAvoy, this... Jenny Cooper. We've met. I'm here all the time because of his 21 elderly patients who have died of Covid in the last month. I see their faces when I sleep. Not that I've really slept since march. - She work here? - That's Bobby. - She died. - I know, I just heard. - Is Bobby here? - No, sweetheart, I'm sorry. Mr. Davis, let's go back to your room. Hey, can you hold this? So, you know anyone who might be angry with her? No, she was very well liked. Hi. I'm Jenny Cooper, I'm the coroner. Did you know Bobby Almeda? I just, I can't believe it about Bobby. I'm sorry. Um, can I... can I help? I'm... Yeah. That would, that would be great, thank you. Did Bobby die of Covid? No. No, I don't think so. She loved the elders. She would bake them treats that she would bring in. She even would sewed us masks when management wouldn't give them to us. But you have an N95s now, right? My brother works in construction, so I spray this thing with Lysol every night. Yeah. That's kind of beautiful. I mean, it's sad, but it's... beautiful. Yeah. Not everyone understands, you know, that you can't have visits. Actually, Bobby had a run-in here. With who? I don't know. Some guy. Ah, my ring always does this... Sorry. I didn't hear what was said, and then... She went up to him and then all of a sudden... Bam! I know how the gem got in her forehead. Are we talking the bedazzling on the steering wheel? - No, uh, jewelry! There was a... A small gem in the cut on her forehead. - Okay. - I just found out that Bobby got into a fight with one of the patient's relatives. - A physical fight? - Yeah! I mean, what if, what if he followed her to the parking lot and then just... did you get a name? No. Put your fist up. Wha...? He was wearing a ring. All right, so your theory is that someone's mysterious relative, wearing a bejeweled ring... Followed her to the big box parking lot. They got in a confrontation, and then he attacked her. - Why? - Don't know. Uh, maybe he couldn't see his parent or grandparent, and he was upset. I'll check their security footage. Did you get anything from the manager? Oh, he blamed her for working in multiple homes. Suggested not too subtly that she had brought the virus here. I knew I recognized her. I mean, I've been here so many times, Donovan. I just, I never even registered the PSWs. You're not a Saint, and everyone's wearing a mask. Yeah. Hey! Hey! Hey. We're having a little memorial for Bobby! I wrote down where.

You gotta keep your... - No, it's okay. You're a way over there, and I'm way the hell over here. Come on, take off your mask. Let's see that face. Please? There she is. 'Kay, what's in the letter? You know, it's been five months of nothing, - and now I get... - What, are you afraid of something? What're you afraid of? I know it's a goodbye. Oh. You still love him. So, what do you, what do you, what do you wanna do? I don't know, I just... I just, I can't... like I just, I can't face this right now. I just can't. I'm so ti... I'm so tired. Can you hold onto it for me? I just, I feel like I'll put it somewhere and I'll just lose it. - Sure. I can do that. - Thank you. I'll just remind you though I have dementia. Yeah. Ooh, I made you the soup that you like. Uh, the squashy one. Eat it up here with me and then we'll just disinfect later. Sorry, dad, I should um... I should, uh, I should eat it down in my lair. Uh, I can't find anything in this new house. - It's just a rental, dad. Bowls are there. In front of me. I'm really happy you live here. Me too. If I was in that nursing home, well, I'd probably be dead. Let me see my mother! Hey! Hey! - This is from yesterday. Bobby worked the 7-11 shift, and around 5 P.M., this goes down. It's hard to ID him off of this. Sir, I need you to calm down! Ooh! All right, go back. Back, back, back. - Right there. - Hm. Zoom in there. - Looky, looky. - What's that? He's wearing a ring. Huh. Hi! Hey. Oh sorry. You came! Have some. This is Bobby's last batch. Thank you. Thanks. Eat up, come on! Do you really think the guy with the ring is gonna show up? Guilt brings all the boys to the yard. - Pretty good. - Mm-hmm. Hmm. I'm gonna go circulate. At a distance.

Cheers! - Cheers. - To Bobby, guys! Get 'em up high. Cheers... - Cheers! - There you go. Hey... - Cheers! - To Bobby, guys! - Cheers! - To Bobby! Bobby would have loved this. Was she outgoing? She loved people. I raised her on our farm. Too quiet, I guess. She was very loved. I worried, you know, when the virus started because of her job, but it was her passion, um, helping people, and she was so hard-working. She's the granddaughter of a farmer, so you probably have a lot in common. And she said, "gung-gung, I'll be careful. These people need me." Yeah. But why? Why take her life? Oh, excuse me. I'm so sorry. - Malik? - Yeah. Yeah. I-yeah. I see the guy, but I can't find Mac. Uh... that's fine. I'll uh... I'll find him. Police! - Get down, down, down! - Ugh! - Ungh! - Detective Abed, homicide. I need to ask you some questions, sir. - I didn't do anything! Agh! Agh! Missing a gem, huh?

I ate the whole thing! - The ent... the entire... The entire thing. Oh my god... oh my god... - I'm so... I'm so... I don't know. Is this your ring? Yeah, it's my championship ring. High school rugby. It's missing a gem. It's from high school. Why am I here? We found this... Embedded in the forehead of Bobby Almeda. You were at her memorial. Maybe feeling a little guilty for punching her in the face? Aw man... Yeah, we have you on camera. I didn't mean to hit her, I swear! Did you follow her to the parking lot after that? What? No! Look, I barely remember, man. I'm at linden tree like every day, begging to see my mother! Begging! She's only 62, but she's got Parkinson's. So, Bobby comes out and you attack her. They don't pick up their landline! My mom doesn't have a phone or like a window I can see. How am I supposed to know she's even alive? - It made you mad. You blamed Bobby. I saw Bobby a couple hours after I hit her. I mean, she was fine. Except that she... Except? You slept in your car?! Just gimme a minute, okay? Okay. Ugh... Ugh... I can still feel the effects of our uh... - Yeah. - "Karaoke." "Karaoke." You know, it took me 3 hours to walk home last night. - Anyways... Take a look at this. Okay. What am I looking at? Security footage. We found the guy who hit Bobby. Few hours later, she brought his mom out the back door for a visit. - That's kind. Hardly a motive for murder. Keep watching. - Yeah. She's bleeding. - Yeah, I'm thinking, could that earlier punch have killed her? She kept bleeding, went to drive, smashed her car. Makes it manslaughter. Maybe. If she had a pre-existing condition. - Hey, uh... Hey, I gotta go. I have a place to be. Ugh. Well, this... Is for you. I quit coffee. Who quits coffee during a pandemic? Who has somewhere to be during a pandemic? Mr. Yee! Hi. Jenny Cooper! - "Th-thrombo, thromb..." - thrombocytopenia. No. Did she ever have frequent nosebleeds? No. Any conditions that would stop her blood - from clotting properly? - To be honest, I thought you were here about this. Bobby was growing it. Wow. This is a lot of weed. Found it about a month ago. At first, I thought strangers were growing on my land. "Guerrilla growers." Hm. So I sat up all one night, waiting, and it was Bobby. I was mad, but we talk, and she said it was to help people. Hmm. What kind of pesticides do you use? Uh... atrazine, but I never spray here. - Okay... ooh! Ooh! Shoot... - Mice. They, they get at the stalks if you use too much mulch. Do you use something for them? What are you looking for? "Brodifacoum." It's a blood thinner. But why would my Bobby eat poison? It's water-soluble. It, it... could've bled into the soil, absorbed into the plants. She baked with it. She ingested it. Maybe there was enough to accumulate in her system. I put that poison there, trying to help her, and now you're saying I killed my own granddaughter. - No! No, I'm not saying... - get out! Mr. Yee, I am just trying to figure out how Bobby died. But you are guessing! She was my granddaughter! Until you know how she died, get off my land! Mr. McAvoy? - That's me. - I'm Dr. Cheng. So you've got some leg pain. Is it a dull pain or shooting? Shooting. Kinda like Jordan playing in old shoes. Can you feel that? Yeah. And the pain, does it go up or down? Up and down, from my leg to my lower back. Hmm. Any numbness in your foot? Sometimes. Hey, maybe I need orthotics. I walk a lot for my job. Well, your MRI suggests we should run some tests. Tests? No poison in either one. But you were right; Bobby did have brodifacoum in her blood. But it wasn't in the plants? Or the brownies, according to my tests. Thanks, river. Hey, that was... oh. - You see? - It's not bad. Yeah, striped. Yeah, it's right there. Oh yeah. Shh... Wow... - Oh... - Oh no. Okay, well, at least we can tell mom we saw one. Premier Doug Ford spoke out today about the treatment of patients in long-term care facilities, calling for full transparency and even suggesting criminal charges. Which begs the question, will he follow through? Okay... My focus for the inquest - will be on infection control. - You mean use of PPE? Yeah, that's, uh, one facet. Linden tree didn't give their workers masks, even though they knew Covid was in the facility. As the crown attorney speaking for the coroner's office, I'm on your side, but can you prove that? Yeah. I sequestered their garbage back in April. No N95s, and no surgical masks. - Very nice. - Thanks. Found a whistleblower-type complaint in their email. That's my sequestered garbage. Okay. Uh... "I've been working for three years. You don't care about the staff or the elderly residents. People are dying every day of Covid. You say it's pneumonia. You say wearing masks will scare the residents. You're killing people. We need protection! Bobby Almeda." What? Um... Uh, nothing. Uh... she died. We just, uh, we never figured it out. Huh. Did anybody get back to her? It says that she was disciplined for giving the residents... Uh, the residents weed brownies. - They didn't fire her. - Uh, no. They, uh... she must've threatened to go public. Linden tree's parent company, care orchard, sent some video. Linden tree said they implemented strict protocols as soon as the outbreak started. Staggered start times for staff, hand sanitizer at all workstations... And entrances. Mm-Kay. There's Gloria. He's switching the bottle. That's Bobby. Wait. Um, show me the next day? 'Kay. He's switching the bottle again. Why is Bobby the only one who gets the small sanitizer? I thought it was ingestion over time. It's uh... it's absorption. Um, are there any uh... Code violations for linden tree? Yeah, yeah. There's a... There's a bunch. What're you looking for? Mice. You're back. No new cases today, happy to report! Step away from the counter, please. What's going on? I have a warrant to search these premises. Bingo. Swapped it out each time for her. - No. - No? Okay, here. Put out your hands. Use it. Come on. I-I just thought she'd get sick and go away. Well, she wasn't that kind of person. Mitch Gnatek, you're under arrest for the murder of Bobby Almeda. Lidocaine should be kicking in. Not as bad as the biopsy, right? Can you feel that? - No, don't feel a thing. - Great. I'm going to insert a needle between your vertebrae. 'Kay. You're doing great. Needle's in. Now I'm just trying to get a little fluid. How's it going back there, doc? Great. You're doing great. H-How long will it take before the results come back? Not long. Mm. I just... Wanna know if I have cancer. Grandpa! Grandpa! I've lost grandpa. What? What do you mean, you've lost grandpa? We were birdwatching and I just saw a hawk and... He's gone, okay?! Great. Just show me where you last were. I circled, and I retraced, and I backtracked. Um... I think we should get grandpa a tracker. I just... I... I don't know how much longer he's gonna be able to do things on his own, Ross. I just wanna... well, yeah, but I, I didn't mean like a leash, mom. I just meant like an app. Yeah. We can, we can look into that. It's his jacket! Dad?! Yeah, I'm over here! Yeah, dad, it's us! Just stay exactly where you are, okay? I'm fine. Oh, I was worried. Hey, it's okay. He's okay. All right? Okay. Ross, honey, I release you. From what? I release you from the responsibility of grandpa. Okay? He's resilient, and you... - You need to be 19. - Mm. Come on. Don't move, dad! - Do you see him? - Yeah. Oh gee. What're you doing? Oh, there's my coat! Oh, there's my dad! - Where have you been? - Sorry. Okay, maybe I got a little lost, but... Look what I found? Do you believe this? This is amazing! Look at this! - Yeah. - I may have, I may have wandered off the trail, but I found this place. Isn't it amazing? - This is really nice. - It's beautiful. I mean, who knew our new place would be adjacent to a spot like this? - Yeah. - This is sweet. You'd find it. Oh yeah. Listen, stay right here, take your time. We'll stick to the main path, huh? I'll try not to wander off. - Very funny. - Yeah. Hello. Clark. What're you doing at my house? I like your look. What? Oh, um... it's not a look, it's an at-home... look. Sorry, uh... Something wrong with the inquest? Yeah, kinda. Are you gonna tell me? I'm trying to decide if you're the kind of person who likes to know, or the kind of person who doesn't. Okay. Um... I don't appreciate you coming to my house, so you can... call me tomorrow or email me. I'm here as a professional courtesy. We got an anonymous tip about your sister's death. Saying what? It's about your dad. The way she fell is suspicious. Yeah, well, are you gonna open a case against my dad - because of this? - I'm not saying that, but... I have to look into it. And who, uh, who put in the tip? You know I can't disclose that. Let me guess. It's an inmate from a correctional facility named Kelly hart? I helped put her in jail, and this door is closed. I'm just the messenger. Oh, this means you have to recuse yourself from our inquest. - Uh, no. No, that's my inquest. - Rota fortuna, Jenny. Fortune's wheel. It was nice working with you.
