 Great. Everything is in the wrong box. Hey. Where do you think we should put this? Ross? Hey, Rossy?! - I'm visualizing. - Okay, well, help me visualize where we should put your Dad's ashes. - The mantlepiece? - No. - Is it calling you? - No. - Is that what we should do? - It's not calling me. - The mantlepiece? - No, no, you're being creepy. - Right here? - You are being creepy. Hey, be careful. I think we should put Dad in the closet until we know what to do with him.

 Okay... - Oh! - Whoa, whoa... Okay. Okay, I got it. This house is the worst. Ow! Shhhh... it. - See? This house hates us. - Mm-mm. Everything's falling apart. You know, we can't go upstairs. Okay, there's just a few leaks in the roof, but... I promise you, Ross, we are gonna feel good about living here, okay? It's work. Jenny Cooper. Where? 'Kay. Thanks. Oh, buddy, I'm sorry, you're gonna have to take the Go Train to school. But that's not part of my routine. - Ross... - I'm kidding. I've already got my bag packed... double suits, double caps, uh, playlist is insane. Because you don't win the race... You uh... you win the day. - Yes. - Got it. - Wisdom absorbed. - Mm-hmm? Oh, hey, uh... I'm gonna be at your practice. - You don't have to be. - But I'm gonna be. Thank you, Rog. - Hey! - Hey. So aside from being "rich", who was this Victor Stenton? - He's the cannabis king. - What? Vic Stenton, the dead man, he's a weed mogul. Huh. The one drug that doesn't kill you. - What's going on there? - Nothing. I just have a splinter. - Yeah? Let me see. - I'm good. You can't work with a piece of wood in your hand. I mean, what if it falls out, contaminates my scene? I come prepared. - All right. Ready? - Mm-hmm. - On three. One... - Ow! - Thanks. - You're welcome. You're gonna need this, and then we're going up to the penthouse. Looks like he came to the door to get help. Nobody answered and he came back. And the party's still going? - Shitty neighbours. - Not a crime. This way. Body's in the bathroom. 'Scuse me, can I please change my clothes? My son is downstairs, waiting for me. Yeah, it's 22 through 24. We'll be as quick as we can. - Geez. - It's a bloodbath. He was moved, after he died. Yeah, his wife found him and called the medics. - They tried to revive him. - Wow... That was optimistic. You okay? Huh? No, yeah, uh... Yeah, I just, I... sometimes I-I... see things in my peripheral vision and... uh... Well, this uh, this crime scene is contaminated to hell. Let's uh... let's get to work. All right. His body is covered in cuts. - Well, death by a thousand. - You'd think. It's actually this enormous hole in his neck that actually killed him. It's really deep. - Have you found the murder weapon yet? - Not yet. We're probably looking for a large knife. Glass. - Help me roll him? - Yeah. Hey, can you give us a hand? - Ready? On three. - Mm-hmm. One, two, three. Wow. That's a lot of wounds on his back. Thanks. - Ready? - Yeah, okay. It's definitely not self-inflicted. Maybe... fell backwards through a window or... No broken windows. Well, he definitely exsanguinated in this room, so if the broken glass didn't originate here or in the apartment... Car crash? Maybe he was thrown through the window... carjacked. Okay, so nude carjacking and then...? Carjacker brought him upstairs, stabbed him, and um... When you say it out loud, it's... - Yeah. - Yeah. He was definitely somewhere else before he died here. Malik. We're looking for a knife. Got it, Mac. There's a full set in the kitchen. I luminol-ed them... no trace of blood. Send some uniforms down to the garbage room. Does she have to be sitting there? She's not a suspect, is she? No, we alibi'd her. She was in New York with her kid, came home and found him. We need her clothes though; we're waiting on a female officer. Well, I can do it. It's not right to have her sitting there like that. Hi. I'm Jenny Cooper, I'm the coroner. Okay, um... let's uh... let's start with your coat. I should've changed my name. Pardon? Vic didn't care about things like that and now he's... and I don't even have his name. Vic was so strong. How could someone do that to him? And... and what... what... what do I tell Luke? What do I tell Vic's parents? Where... where are we gonna sleep tonight? I don't know what to do. - Okay. - I don't know what to do! Hey. You don't have to do anything, okay? Not right now. You are stronger than you know, and you need to remember that for your son. Thank you. I hope you never go through anything like this. Whoa... You know the saying, "a little dab'll do"? It goes for cologne too. It is burning my eyes. We're tired of being harassed with all these noise complaints. It's not harassment if the police come once, Mr...? I'm not giving you a name. I'm a lawyer, I know my rights. Your right to party, is that what you're fighting for? That's good. Is that what you're fighting for, because if not, we're here about a homicide. - What? - Murder. Hey. Uh... Was Vic Stenton at your party? - What happened to Vic? - You know Vic Stenton? - I should call a lawyer. - Oh, but you are a lawyer. Okay, this is a business gathering. It's, it's for professionals. It's like a networking event. There's very important people here, so please don't... oh... This is a sex party. Party's over, sex friends! Yup, come on, get up. Were you two with Vic last night? We were with a lot of people last night. Queer, straight. Black, white. Blonde hair, purple hair. Was there ever any jealousy? This isn't the '90s. We're social disrupters. Tech moguls, software engineers... These parties are an extension of our bold, unconventional lifestyles. We're living our brands. Are you a tech mogul? We own a chain of very successful gluten-free bakeries. It's not what you think. Where's your partner? I do pretty well on my own, Detective. Uh... did you see any broken glass anywhere? No. When was the last time you saw Vic? I signed an NDA. In the cuddle puddle, then he must've paired off. - With who? - I was busy and the music was loud, but if they paired off, it was probably in here. - Thank you. - Mm. So this was probably the last place anyone saw Vic. I mean, is it possible that he was attacked here first? We'll luminol the hell out of the place, see what we can find. Oh, uh... - hey, are you good? - Yeah. - Where you going? - Pool party. Pool party, sex party. Everyone's goin' to parties. You're rolling too soon. Yeah, 'cause my pull-through's too weak and my stroke-count's off. 'Cause you haven't been in the pool for three months. 'Cause I've been in Bellwoods with you, eating charcoal ice cream and Kayla's edibles. Couple more practices, you'll be gold medal again. I don't know about that. Okay, how do I tell her that she doesn't have to come every practice? After your dad, I think you'd enjoy having a parent not yell at you for excessive rolling? But I was rolling too much. Dad noticed it. We fixed it. I got faster. Her new hair though. Is she like, traumatized? That's why women cut their hair. You should see our new house. I'm more worried about you. Oh, I'm-I'm great. Come on, we've got Favro for homeroom. Oh, in case you missed getting yelled at. Yeah. You have to chuck your cups, Dr. Cooper. Uh... I will, River, I will. Thank you. He's pretty muscular. What do you think? Steroids? Ah, the tox screen will tell all. But, if not, I am definitely following his trainer on Instagram. Does he have breast implants? Pec implants. That would be my reading of those luminous masses - on the scan. - Hmm. What's your reading of this? Oh, uh... I thought it was glare, but if the pec implant is obscuring something...? - Do you uh, do you have a rag? - Yeah. Uh, whoa! Don't do that... No, it already did all the damage it could on the way in. Somebody stabbed him so hard it just slipped in there. This was no accident. Man, rich people throw away crazy things. Painting of a dog, lamps, solid gold bracelet. Can I keep it? We luminoled that room... found blood traces galore. Okay... - Find any glass yet? - Nada. Look. ID! This matches the piece that I pulled out of Vic's body. Yeah, I would say it's the glass top of a coffee table. The woman who was flirting with you... Okay... She put her drink on the... floor. Yeah, there was nowhere else to put it. Vic liked glass furniture. It didn't spoil the "view". The view of what? You knew about Vic's activities? Uh, can you uh... let me back into my place? My son's blankie's missing. Malik. You should show her some kindness. I'm letting her back into a crime scene, which is against the rules. Please don't lecture me. I'm not lecturing. I'm sorry, do, do we have a problem? I like that you're dogged. It... - But...? - Hang on a sec. - Would you say that's...? - Purple. - Someone mentioned purple hair. - Yeah, everyone signed an NDA. We can go through the stack. She works at The Mother Tree, Vic's dispensary, as a budtender. She tried to sell the Uniforms some "Mr. Nice" when they picked her up. Lauren Foster? Look, what I do is perfectly legal. Hey, I support a marijuana amnesty. - Where were you last night? - At home. Watching TV. Now I know you're lying. Millennials don't watch TV. Is that blood? Mm-hmm. I'm not a cop, okay? I'm the coroner, and I am just trying to put a picture together of how your boss, Vic Stenton, how he died. May I see your hands, please? I'm a doctor... I was... so I understand how hard it is to work with sore hands. You have broken glass in your hands, Lauren. You were at Vic's cuddle puddle. I didn't kill him. Oh, Shanti must be so upset. What about you, Lauren? Your hands are all cut up. What happened to you? Vic was your boss. He invited you to the party. Mm-hmm. You had a few drinks? - Not a crime. - No, not what I meant. No one consents to being sexually assaulted, no matter what kind of party they're at. The party was mostly older guys and I wasn't into... any of the women, so I found an empty room to sleep off my drunk. And the next thing I knew, Vic was in his bathrobe and he was like... pressing himself against me, and he was so heavy I could barely breathe. So I pushed him, he pulled me, we fell, there was glass everywhere, and I fought him off. - Using what? - I don't know. It happened so fast. Could you have stabbed him, in the heat of trying to get him off you? Yeah, maybe. I was really drunk. A bunny saved me. - Excuse me? - Uh... There was this giant, human-sized rabbit. It... it led me from that room and took me downstairs and put me in a cab. No, I swear Vic was alive when I left with the bunny. I mean, maybe "third man syndrome"? Third bunny. Well, if she's making it up, why choose such an insane detail? - Go big or go home. - Mm. The wounds on her hands would've been much worse if she had pushed that piece of glass into Vic's body. I mean, the pressure needed to get it into his thoracic cavity, plus the, the angle of the entry wound. I mean, someone would have to be standing above him and slam that piece of glass into Vic's body. And look at her. I believe her. And I believe her about the bunny too. Hi, I'm, uh, Jenny Cooper. I'm the coroner, I'm investigating Vic Stenton's death. Did any dry cleaning come down from the penthouse? A bunny suit, in particular. - I can check. - Okay. - This is nuts, you know? - Well, it was a sex party. What if there was a furry there? - No-one mentioned it. - Well, we didn't ask. Maybe it was normal. Hmm. Thank you. I'll be damned. - How did you know? - In my experience, when you imagine animals, they don't help you out. Do you imagine animals a lot? No. Then I'd be crazy. If you were crazy, you wouldn't know it. Well, people can't self-diagnose. It's something you learn when you're a doctor. I would say people lie, even to themselves. That's what you learn as a police officer. It's funny. You're autopsying a bunny. No, I'm taking blood swabs to see if I can get a match to Vic Stenton so I don't have to wait forever for your forensics team to get it to me. Well, I guess whoever wore this just liked to watch. Remember how I said that Lauren would've cut through tendons in her hands? What if Vic's killer was wearing these? What's that smell? Blood. Okay, what're you doing? No, Alison, you can't do this. This is evidence in a homicide. Alison, you really can't be here right now. Aqua di Gio. My university boyfriend wore it. I know who was in the suit. Oh... Too bad. The dealer has four too. What're you gonna do? I don't know. I... Mm... Hit me. - You're kidding. - No. - Oh... - Come on, give it to me. Kind of predicted that. - You're always busting yourself. - I know, I know. You're never gonna win that way. God, you're worse than your father. What do you mean? Your father, what a brutal gambler. Oh my God. Of course, he had a, he had a gambling addiction, but he lost $250 grand and then he lost your house. He lost everything. I shouldn't laugh really. - What? - Yeah. It's almost dinnertime, Gordon. - Oh, brilliant! What is it? - Roast beef. Roast beef. Want some roast beef? No? Are you okay? Put that in your pocket. Thanks for the jail break, kid. Hey, give me a shout later. You were naked in some... not very sexy underwear when we met, Gus. Leads me to believe that wasn't your full party outfit. Okay, I wore the damn suit, but not because I'm a "furry". It's covered in blood. I don't give a shit what you like in bed. - He made me wear it. - Vic? Yeah. I wasn't attractive enough to be at the parties. You get to watch, but not participate. I was supposed to be his business partner. He cut me out of the dispensary; he cut me out of the online vaping business. He treated me like dirt! So is that why you killed him? I didn't kill him! That crazy bitch with the purple hair stabbed him. Did you see her do this? I came into the bedroom. The coffee table's broken, there's glass everywhere, Vic is all cut up, he's bleeding... Was he dead? He was walking around, yelling. He must've died after... I got... I got her a cab. Wait! Did she say I killed him? Sit down, Mr. Prisciac! He was gonna rape her! I was the good Samaritan! The blood on your paws... I am not going down for something I didn't do! Whoa! This is not a good look, Gus. Come on... Come on, man. - I didn't do anything! - Mm-hmm. Okay... - Okay... - Hi? Hey! Uh... hold on. Jesus. Your parents' home? - No. Sorry. - No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Uh... Liam Bouchard. I used to work for Mrs. Panych. So I do some landscaping for her. These are cookies. That's a nectarine tree. And here... pass this on, okay? Look, um... we-we don't... she, she probably... look, we can't afford anything right now. You see, with this place and the move... Uh, well, you see, my dad died, so... - Oh. - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry. - Thanks. Um, you know, my Mom's got this new job, so I'm pretty sure that any home repairs are just gonna be me and YouTube's "How the Hell Do You Fix This" channel, so... Okay, wait. Uh... - Is your Mom...? - The Coroner. Okay, yeah. She, she was here when Mrs. Panych died. Wha...? Mrs. Panych died inside the house?! Yeah. But, uh, not something you heard from me. - Which room?! - Wait. - What's your name? - Ross. Well, I live in a tree, Ross, and I drive that, so my only real expense is the burger and beer I consume every night. All paid for with the adequate cheque that I get monthly from the Canadian Armed Forces. I can help, all right? Just tell your Mom to call me. It's normal to feel anger and even rage towards David, and it's okay to keep some things from Ross. It's not lying. Well, it's not telling the truth. So I uh... I went to a cuddle puddle for work. - You know what that is? - Uh-huh. How did that make you feel? You know... Oh... I uh... I slept with someone. I didn't tell you that. - At the cuddle puddle? - No! No. God, no. No, uh, with a... with a man that I met. How was it? It was good. It was uh... it was great. Before David died uh... we were sleeping in separate bedrooms. You know, and Ross... Ross never noticed. I'd sleep in the guest bedroom and then I'd sneak back to our bedroom so that if Ross came down for breakfast, that he would see me there. I would just... I'd ball up tissues and I'd put them on the bedside table and... You know, so it, so it looked like it was... lived in. What're you thinking? That only one side of the bed was lived in. Hey! My name's Jenny Cooper. Is your Mom home? Yes. Come on in. Thank you. Do you happen to know where she is? In the bedroom. Okay. Thank you. Shanti? Yeah! Come on! Hey... - Where're you going? - Back to New York. I thought we could stay uptown with friends, but it's still too close. Oh... Come on! When uh... when my husband died, I sold our house in Toronto, I packed up my son and I, and moved us out to the country. You're a widow, and a mother? Yeah, and uh... currently struggling with both. I don't want to pull Luke away from his friends - and his home... - But you wanna run away. As fast as I can, as far as I can. I'm tired. The uh... the police have someone in, in custody. - Who? - Gus Prisciac. Gus killed Vic? Why? Detective McAvoy's looking into that. I'm, I'm sure he'll be in touch. Hey, did you uh... did you and Vic sleep in separate rooms? - Shhh... - What's wrong? I-I don't hear anything. Luke? Luke! Luke? Where's my son? I don't see him! Luke?! Luke, honey! Luke?! Luke?! Luke? Hey... Won't he come here? Hey! He's here! - Hey, love. - Hi. Hi! Your uh... your Mom's looking for you. I wanna say goodbye to the bunny. The bunny. - You know the bunny? - Daddy visited him. When? When was the last time you saw him? With the purple-haired lady. Oh, sweetie! Oh, sweetie. Don't ever scare Mommy like that again, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Come on. Let's go finish packing. Thank you. Come on. Come on... pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up... - This is Donovan McAvoy. - Dammit. Send a text or leave a message. Detective, it's Jenny Cooper. The wife, she's lying. Shanti?! Hey. Are you uh... are you headed to the airport? - Yes, but... - Can I get a ride? I can just... I can take a cab to Dundas from there. I... My car broke down. Uh... sure. 'Kay. I can take that. Come on. So, uh, did you uh... did you ever go to any of the parties? It's how Vic and I met. We stopped when we got pregnant. Wow. But he went back? He was just getting his business off the ground and he figured he could use them to network. But you... never wanted to go back? I changed. Luke was enough. Well, you had to have had a... like an arrangement. We did. He started coming home with scratches on his back, on his neck. Places where Luke could see them. And how did he explain that? Oh... Once he got his brand, he stopped caring about being discreet. I'm the one who had to lie to our son. Yeah. I know what that's like. How did your husband die? Uh... of an aneurysm. You're lucky. I'm sorry, but... you are. Yeah, well, I'm an ER doctor that couldn't save him, so. He lied to me too. It wasn't the lies. I saw her... with her hands cut and I... I knew... Lauren? Mama! Mama! A bunny! Oh yeah. Mama... Mama... A bunny. I took Luke downstairs... and when I came back up... he was still alive. Oh, Vic... baby, let me help you. That must hurt. Yeah, yeah, let me help you get it out. Hey. You were at a party, huh? With Lauren? Ahhhhh! He attacked her. I knew it. Unngghh! How long before Luke saw something I couldn't explain away? Okay, you need to take your foot off... off the gas! I couldn't keep hiding what he was doing! Shanti, Luke is in the car! You need to slow down! You wanted to save your husband! I had to protect my son! Shanti, pull over the car! Shanti, pull over! Shit! Shanti, pull over! Mom! Mom! Oh my God. - Hey. Wha...? - Shhh. Hey, he's sleeping. Were you trying to get yourself killed? Just give her... give her a second, okay? She's making arrangements for her parents to fly out to take care of him. So... you do live in a treehouse? Pretending you're a pirate? Uh, yeah. I like being off the grid. My son said you came by. - Oh, okay. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, I... I didn't realize, w-when I came by. I... Look, I'm not um... I'm not ready. Just my life is a crazy, chaotic mess and... Wait. I don't wanna make your life worse. - Okay? - Yeah. Just... yeah. Okay, um... Can I have your card back? I um, I'll put it on my fridge, - just in case I need to call. - Oh yeah, sure. Sure. Mmm... I'm here with my son. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's just, it's uh... - It's too early. - I got it. Yeah. Yeah. But we can still... We can still be friends. With benefits. If the, if the benefits are you... Maybe fixing your busted roof? Yeah. I mean, no, I can't afford that yet. Hmm. Actually... can you fix the bridge over the stream by my house? - Sure. - Mm-hmm? I can do anything. Morning. What's that crescent? That's the moon. - Those little splotches? - Mmm. They're impact craters. Meteorites that hit the moon. If we weren't protected by the atmosphere, they'd hit us too. But they don't. Only the moon has to fight the good fight. Finding you here last night... was a nice surprise. I tried to get you to come to one of those parties, remember? I still love the way you smell. I think about you too. Straight up? I'm just here for sex. Nothing else. Ross? Wha...? Hey... Hey. Grandpa told me about Dad and his gambling. It's okay to be mad at him. - Well, he's dead. - What good does it do? At least when you two were fighting he was alive to fight back. You knew about that? Ross... We were trying to make it work. Okay? There was a lot of love there... It doesn't matter. He's dead. But he loved you more... - He loved you... - Stop! - Take a step... - Just-just... stop! Please. Hey... Hey! I don't wanna go back. I only went in yesterday because I owed it to him, but to do it *** It just feels, like someone else's life. I know. We'll get through this together. okay.
