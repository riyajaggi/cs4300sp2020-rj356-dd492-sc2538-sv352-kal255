Man, don't make racist comments like that. Don't go all PC on me, bruh! Wait, Ross khalighi? That's Jenny Cooper's son. Well, there's always a bad apple. - No other suspects? - No, he's with duty counsel now. For all the good that's gonna do him. I'll take over now. You go write up the warrants, bruh! Looks like you got caught with blood on your hands. In both senses of the word. But? But I can, I can get bail, right? You've been charged with murder. You're not getting released on a promise to appear. You're gonna have to spend the night in lockup. Uh, we're outta time. So, look, I... I can't stay overnight in jail. We'll strategize a plea bargain later. - I've got a bail hearing. - But I didn't do anything! Right now, doesn't matter what you did. Look, eat something. And don't talk. Nice to meet you, Mr. Khalighi. - Ross? - Hmm. - I'm detective mcavoy. - I know, I know. Look... There's been a really big misunderstanding. Okay, but you know me, right? I'm... I'm not a murderer. I know your mom. Okay. Well... No one has been listening to me. Even my own duty counsel Is trying to tell me it doesn't matter what I did. But I didn't do anything. All right, I'm gonna record this If you're giving me a statement. Are you gonna help me? Are you asking to give me a statement Without a lawyer present? Yes. Yes. All right. All right, it's Friday, October 3, 9:00 A.M., Detective Donovan mcavoy interviewing Ross khalighi. All right, Ross, you have my undivided attention. Tell me what happened. I went into the room Because of the gunshots. There he was, he was right there. You went to the party to sell drugs. You got into a beef with the homeowner. And you stabbed him, with this. No. That's what the evidence tells me. So, why don't we try this again? What were you doing at the party? I was... I was just havin' fun. All right, what's the gap between having fun And guy with holes in him? Run! You didn't go there with anybody? You didn't talk to anybody? I don't remember. You told detective west, and I quote, "I meant to clean that off," about this. That's called an utterance, Ross, And it holds up in court. Why would you bring a screwdriver to a party anyways? I, it was, it was just in my pocket. I was fixing a car with my grandpa and I just... And then, after that, I'm at the party, with the dead guy. I don't know who you think you're protecting. But it's not you. Hi, ma'am? Uh, I'm here for my son, Ross khalighi. He's been detained. Sorry, you won't be able to see him. Why not? I can't disclose that information. No, sorry, I, I wanna see my son. - I have a right to see my son. - Sorry, ma'am, you can't, And you don't. Um, can you call detective mcavoy for me, please? I'm Jenny Cooper. I'm the Coroner.

What are you? - Hey, is Ross okay? - No, he's not. - Wha? - He's been charged with murder. What? I mean, Ross wouldn't hurt anybody. There is no way that you can be taking this seriously? I'm taking the evidence against him, seriously. What is the evidence against him? I can't tell you that! That would be compromising the investigation. Oh my... I mean, you're, you're helping him, right? Do you want me to be the one that's in there with him? Yes, of course. Yeah. Best thing you can do for Ross Is find him a defence attorney that has more than five minutes to spend with him. I gotta go. Hi. Uh, is Marie halcrow there? I, I need a lawyer for my son. She's in trial, okay. Hi, yes, uh, can I speak with Nicholas digba? I need a lawyer. My son has been falsely accused of murder and... Great. Mr. Digba is on vacation.

Let's do that thing we talked about. - Hmm? You wanna do that? - Yeah! I don't know where I got it. Okay. What about this? It looks like my dad's watch. It's, looks like his watch, if he was still here. - You sure? - Yeah. His is not as tacky as that one. But you were wearing this one. What? This was on your wrist when you were booked. That's not my watch. All right. I'm gonna show you something, okay? Look closely. What's Joshua Harris wearing in each of these pictures? He's, he's wearing the watch. He is. I have no idea how I got that, okay? None. His lawyer's here to see him. I thought she had bail hearings. Pausing interview. You came to the party to sell the drugs. You saw the watch, reminded you of your father. No! You were emotionally distraught. You stabbed Joshua Harris and you stole his watch. No, no, that, that is not what happened. Until you tell me different, That's what the evidence says. Uh, your conference call is up. - Oh, okay. Uh, thank you. - Alphonse, whatever you do, Do not let me go into the autopsy suite, okay? Oh, okay, I like this game, jc. - It's not a game. - Right. Okay. Hey, don't waste my time if you're not even there, lady. I'm here. My mom had to re-mortgage her house when legal aid ended. She doesn't want anymore false hope. No, you're absolutely right, Mr. Bennett. I'm sorry. Um... Can we go back to wyllanne's injuries? You said that you kept reliving the moment That the evidence was shown in court. Wyllanne's back broken, yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, I did that. I have a, I have a chest X-ray here. I mean, her spine looks fine. No, it's, it's broken. I'm sorry do to this, Mr. Bennett, But I need to show you wyllanne's x-rays. - Uh, come on, lady. No. - No, it's important. Can you, can you tell me what this is? - It's wyllanne's back. - Every single bone is broken. And can you show me where this is on your body? My back. Uh huh. Okay, so you admitted you were in the room. Murder weapon is in your pocket. And you're wearing the dead man's watch. You come from a dysfunctional home. I'm a friend of your mother's by the way. So what, you're, you're not my duty counsel, - But you're still my lawyer? - No, I'm not your lawyer, I'm, I'm a crown attorney. And they're doing you a favour by letting me talk to you. I, I'm here to prevent you from making things Worse for yourself. Okay. So, should, should I stop talking? No, you can't stop talking, you gotta keep talking. You can't stop now. You need to repaint the narrative. Okay, but... I told them everything I know, so... Okay. It's not like I can just, I can just do better, here. Listen, when, when you get entangled with the cops, You lose control. Okay, all your power is taken away from you. You're in the system. You just start to refute what they say, And boom, they got you. I'm here to give you back your power. Okay, how? Focus on the details that are important to you. Okay? They've dug you a hole; Now we build you a ladder. A colleague sent these over. - Jenny? - Sorry. - Your images. - From Boston university. A former football player donated his brain To their chronic traumatic encephalopathy centre. - Brain looks shrunken. - Look at the sulci. You can see the sulci through they gyri more easily Than you would on a normal brain. Happens a lot to these poor athletes. Football, rugby, boxing. - Hockey. - Definitely. Could be why he couldn't shake that bad mood. Thank you. This has uh, this has been really helpful. Oh, I'm about to finish the Joshua Harris autopsy. If you'd like to join? You get some good advice from your lawyer? Yeah, I did. Like, from the beginning, I've been treated different. I'm getting treated like a suspect because I'm brown, And I know that I'd get the benefit of the doubt - If I was white. - Welcome to reality. As a mixed kid, you have privilege, until you don't. You're trying to tell me what I was doing, But what I remember Is what I was feeling. All I want is the truth, Ross. Come on! What are you doing? We can hear you pacing over the bone saw. Just come in. I can't. Uh, have you been body snatched? You love autopsies. Well, not love, but... oh, what's wrong? Um, I'm sorry. Uh... Ross... My son, my son is being held on this case. They've charged him. I'm sorry. Oh, Jenny. That's horrible! Oh. I don't wanna compromise this case. I mean, and I wanna ask so many, so many questions. I just, I can't. I'm not supposed to be near here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Uh... Sorry, river. We found... There's water in the stomach. Oh, god. - Who are you calling? - I have to call Donovan. Use my phone. It was Matteo's idea. Going to the party? I've been really stressed out. - Let's open things up. - Just for tonight, okay? - Okay. - Okay. My family um, they can be a little overwhelming. I felt like I was just jumping out of my own skin. And then, I was feeling free. Felt like I was flying. I could feel the wind. And the air on my face. And then... I could just, just see it. It was so shiny. Are you talking about the watch, Ross? Yeah, I found it, in the yard. It was beside the hot tub. I picked it up. It felt heavy. And it, it was wet. The watch was wet. Yeah. Yeah, the watch, And the grass. I felt alive, you know. Then what? What are you feeling now? - Hi. - Hi. Um, I feel uh, I'm feeling friendly. I made a friend. Does this friend have a name? Ross? I like your name. I like your name. Shimmery shameer. No, I don't remember. We wanted to get into the bedroom. For some privacy. - Oh, through this door. - Oh, no. Locked. We couldn't. The door was locked. The door to the bedroom Where you found the body, was locked? - Yeah. - Yeah, but it was, It was weird, because... - I felt... - run! Come on. You felt? He, one minute, he was out cold. Come on. And the next, He was opening the door. Let me give you a hand. Who Ross? It was the guy. Guy with the neck tattoo. But I just... I just didn't notice it because I... Whoa, hey. Hey! No, no, hey. Okay. Come on! Come on! I just... That's it. That's it. Donovan mcavoy, pausing interview. What? Why? What's wrong? Hey! I, I'm not lying! Where are you... I'm not lying! Malik, our timeframe's wrong. The murder wasn't committed during the party, It was committed before the party. That's a wrinkle in time. And the pathologist found water in his stomach, Which means the guy bled out in water. Ross said he found the watch near the hot tub. - Aw, Mac, we checked it. - It was dry! Check it again. All right! Whatever you say, boss! One second, Mac. Okay, you there? Yeah, I'm still here. Uh, Huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, there's something in the drain. Huh. It's a barbecue skewer. The suspect killed Joshua Harris in the hot tub, Moved the body to the bedroom, locked the bedroom door, Let the party completely contaminate the crime scene. Yeah, then waited for a distraction to unlock the door. It's uh, it's a good plan. You almost have to admire it. Do you think you could ID the guy You saw unlock the door? - Yeah. - Am I, am I going to prison? No, Ross. You're free to go. - Cte. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, we should've seen this. - Well, nobody looked. I mean, this diagnosis doesn't exonerate oshae, But cte causes confusion, So his confession, you know, it might not be valid. Which means his lawyers have a good case for an appeal. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Sorry, this doesn't seem just like uh, Crossing I's and dotting t's. Doesn't seem like you wanted to win this one. I did wanna win. When I caught oshae's case, I was stalled on my career. Happens a lot to crowns of colour. But I went hard. And I got him convicted. He put me on the map. Well, yeah-sorry, you don't, I mean, you don't have to... You don't have to explain yourself. Yeah, I usually don't, but I... I don't want you to feel used. I don't. I will uh, Make sure that his defence lawyer gets these. Yeah. Don't tell anyone that you heard it from me. I won't. Um, Donovan? Yeah. Yeah, thank you. He's out? Yeah. Yeah, he's out. I'm glad your kid's okay. A guy named Doug downey has been arrested. He and Joshua Harris were partners In a counterfeiting gang. Until Joshua cut him out of the business. Real ballbuster. Yeah, understatement of the year. This sucks. This whole system just sucks. Like, let's just burn this whole thing to the ground. I mean, what are we doing? You know, what happened to you was wrong. It should never have happened. But it does. And worse. George Floyd. Chantel Moore. Breonna Taylor. Regis korchinski-paquet. How can you even work for the police? Who'd you rather? I hate that I'm mixed. And I hate that I even need to think about that right now. Don't even go there. Your racial identity's not a burden. That's when they win. Racism is born of fear. Fear that what's different could be equal, If not more powerful than them. So, for hundreds of years, They've created laws, rules, And belief systems to try and keep us down. You need to find the joy and power In your own identity. Yeah, I guess. - You might not feel it now... - But you will. Hey. He's had quite a day. It's not about you. Yeah. I know, I just... Hi. Smells good. You're making vaavishkaa. Dad used to make that when he had a rough day. I miss dad. I know. God, I wish he was here. You wanna talk about it? Eventually. But not right now. Yeah. I'll um, I'll call you when it's ready. - Shouldn't be long. - You're okay?
