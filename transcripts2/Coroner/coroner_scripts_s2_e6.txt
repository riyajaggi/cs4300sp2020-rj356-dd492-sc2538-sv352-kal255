 Drink this. I like your family. They seem to really like you too. If you ever wanna talk or hangout or... whatever. - Don't let your bucket fill up, brother. - Does the name Dyanne Tucci  ring a bell? I'm a social worker. It's quietly known  that I help women get away if they need to. Hi, my name is Dyanne Tucci.

 My husband, Shane, threatened  to kill me if I left him. Jenny! Those restless nights do they happen to include  sleepwalking? I will fix this.  I promise. - Dyanne Tucci was a devoted nurse. She worked long and hard hours. When she was not  at the hospital she loved to escape  to the rocks, as she used to say. She loved nature. Live from Devil's Path,  Ladies! Catskills! I made it!

 It is so beautiful! I made it! Woooo! Whatever trail or climb  she was taking on, she would post videos for her friends. By the time I met Dyanne,  she was an island. She cancelled plans, claiming she was sick. If people called to check in, she wouldn't answer the phone. - Emma, not her real name, is our guest. She's the one that Dyanne  went to for help. Emma helps other women escape abusive situations. Quite the dangerous trade. - I think of it more as a calling. When would you say  everything changed? - Early spring, 2017. Dyanne married Shane Tucci. And eventually,  Dyanne Tucci would vanish without a trace. - The police said there was not enough evidence of a crime committed. But deep down, I knew she was dead. You're awake! Don't get out of bed just yet,  Dr. Cooper. You can lie back down. You have a few exercises to do,  same as last night. Okay. So only moving your eyes,  look up... and now to your feet... now left... right. Point your toes down... and up. Take a deep breath... and hold. Okay. Keep holding. and exhale. Excellent, all done. Come in. - Hey. - Hey. - You don't have to say it. I know I know I look like a lab rat. - Nah, you look fine. Like a, Jenny marionette. You doing good otherwise? - Yeah, Dr. Sharma, my psychiatrist, says that this will help me. - Good. - Donovan I-- - Hey... if you happened to have a little down time today, take a look at a file for me. A friend of mine is helping out one of those, true crime podcasts? And they think they might have something new. - Where's the body? - That's the thing... there isn't one. - Okay. How do you-- - Then just have a look at it for me with those Jenny eyes. If anything jumps out at you, call me. - I will. Yeah. - Alright. - Hey... thank you. - Alright. Okay. There's a clear history of abuse. Are you  gonna help me find this missing puzzle piece  or what? - Dad, you do realize that I have not been home for the past two days, right? - Yeah. So what am I supposed to do now? I put all this work into this stupid thing, and now I walk away and leave a big divot right in the middle of it? - How you looked under the rug? In your pockets? Is it-is it in the vacuum? - Am I totally inept to you? (Theme music form "Fernandes" plays) - What are you watching? - It's that "Fernandes", that show about the coroner I keep telling you about. It's given me a whole new perspective on what you do for a living. - Did you call her? - Who? - I told you not to call her! Jenny, I told him not to bother you. - Yeah. It's okay. - How are you? Do you need anything? I can pop something over after I give your dad his meds and lunch. - No, I'm... I'm good. - Okay. Well, we should get going then. - Yeah, 'cause we're gonna go and paint the town red. - You wish. - Yeah. - Jenny, listen, okay? There is nothing wrong with you that a good night of sleep  won't fix. And don't let anyone  tell you otherwise. - Yeah, thanks, Kelly. I-- We really appreciate  contributions from law enforcement... especially those still active on the force. - Well, to be honest, I almost didn't show up after I saw what you named your podcast - "Slaughter into Wine?" - Would you like a t-shirt? - No. I'm good. Thanks. You made it? - You said these two had something I'd wanna see? - Glad you came. Since we posted part one  of the Dyanne Tucci story, we've received tons of support and messages. But... this email in particular caught our attention. This was sent by  an anonymous source. Claiming that they were with Shane Tucci the night that Dyanne disappeared. - Shane was at the track drinking with friends. Witnesses saw him, his credit card statements back it up. We know all this. The email says Shane's alibi is bogus. - Okay. Not to rain on your parade, but we get a hundred of these "tips" every case. Yes, so do we. But this one stood out... Fiery Ruckus. Dance Me Gently. Boosty. Scarlett Moonbeam. - All racehorses that ran the night Dyanne disappeared. - What if Shane wasn't at the track all night? What if he left long enough to kill Dyanne, and the person who sent this email saw him leave? The problem is we have no way of reaching whomever sent the email. - I do. - Hi Jenny. - Hey. - What's all this? - Donovan just um... he asked me to do him a- a favour? - Okay... it couldn't wait two days? - I mean, it was for a case, so what was I supposed to do say, say no? - Jenny, why are we here? - Um... - And no, I'm sleepwalking, is not the answer. - Because, if I don't fix this... someone might get hurt. - Okay. I'll make sure this is waiting for you in the control room once you're done here today. So. How are the new SSRIs? - Yeah, they're good. They're fine. - Well, I was reviewing the data from last night with the technician, and I was somewhat surprised to see that you've been having more REM sleep here then I understand you were at home. - I mean, isn't that a good thing? - It's a bit abnormal. For most people it's the opposite. - Are you saying... that my stress is coming from home? - Let's see what today yields before we draw any conclusions. Get through the multiple sleep latency test. Which is really a fancy way to say-- - A nap. Yeah. - I'm proud of you, Jenny. Stay with this. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Ha ha! Salut! - Hey! - Tiens toi! The chicken farm is only five kilometers away, so we thought, why not surprise our son. - You still came all this way just for chickens though? - A chicken. - No. Heirloom chickens. - Maybe, maybe you two could go with René to pick them up? - Y-yes please! - Yeah. - Yeah? - 100%. Yeah. - I know I don't look farmsy, but I feel like I had horses in another life. - Dad, you really bring this? - Ta da! Last time I've seen this, I must've been like ten years old? - We know your Jenny has a son, and we thought it'd be a nice gift for the little one. Yeah, um... I'm-I'm-I'm the, little one. - So sorry to bother you-- - Gordon. I'm just checking. I might have lost a piece of my puzzle. Everybody check under their shoe. No. no. Well, what the hell is this? Who dug this up? - Elodie! - Okay, what did they say? - He want to know if you want some tea? No merci. What kind of firewall are you guys using? Secured storage? Authentication measures? - Full disclosure, we just use whatever antivirus software came with it. - No problem. - I was surprised when you said you were doing this. Seems really public for you. - I owe it to Dyanne. And I saw what Flora and Tim were doing, and realized that podcasts can be a tool. - We looked for her, Noor. No stone left unturned. There just wasn't any evidence. - Her medical records weren't evidence enough? Her broken bones, bruises. - She never once said he hit her. Just that she'd had some sort of accident. I looked through those case files. - Dyanne and I took baby steps. We started forming a plan. Then stopped. When she felt ready, we started up again. Until all we had left was to figure out the right time for her to leave. - Just before she disappeared. They think they're stuck. They don't know that there's something else possible. - Until they meet you. - Got it! Got the original IP address. It's residential, East York. The home is registered to a Frederick Haslem? - Wait, I-I know that name... what does he have to do with the alibi? - That's Freddie Haslem... he was Shane's alibi. - Excuse me, Ma'am? I'm Detective Donovan McAvoy. I was hoping to speak with Freddie Haslem. Is he home? - I'm Bonnie, Freddie's partner. He isn't home. - You know where I might find him? Or are you expecting him back anytime soon? - We gotta go inside. It's me you wanna talk to, okay? I sent the email. - Sorry. Wrong room. - Wait, hey! Sorry. Come-come here. Hi. You're-you're a patient here - obviously. - I'm John. I'm serving two nights for insomnia. What are you in for? - Sleepwalking, um, unfortunately. - Don't be embarrassed. I used to sleepwalk in med school, woke up in a morgue one day I had no recollection how I got in there. - You're an MD? - Yeah. I am. Then you can't turn me down. - I'm sorry? Turn you down for what? Laura, why don't you go watch your cartoons. I knew someone would come, eventually. I'm no Bill Gates, I just Googled, how to send an anonymous email. - Why the podcast? - It's the first time I'd ever heard her last name... Dyanne Tucci. Like Sh-Shane Tucci. It's okay, take your time. Breathe. - It was our second date, me and Freddie. He wanted to go to the track which was fine by me, I got to dress up. But then we get there and... Shane's there. And I mean who invites their colleague out on a date with a girl they've just started seeing? - Colleague? - Freddie kept calling him a colleague. I thought that was weird, but whatever, the whole night was weird. - In what way? - Our first date was cheap night out at the movies, now he's throwing money around like it's nothing. - Shane or Freddie? - Both of them. Well, kinda only Shane actually. I'm getting you all messed up here. I don't think Freddie meant anything bad. - We don't have to rush, okay? - So you and Freddie go to the track and Shane's there... - Yeah, at the beginning. Then he left, but... he let Freddie keep his card. Told him to keep buying drinks. A few hours later, Shane's back, third-wheeling us. - Hey, Bonnie, you can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that you saw Shane leave the track that night? - I-- - Bob next door said there was police at the house. - I'm Detective Donovan McAvoy. Freddie, let's you and I step outside for a minute, please? - Sorry, Freddie. - It's okay. - Okay. Let's go. - This is like "Ocean's Eleven". - Yeah, something like that. - Yeah, I don't normally do "dares", but what the heck. - I mean, I didn't-I don't really "dare" you. I asked. - Kinda felt like a dare. - You'll look out for me? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Hey. - Yeah. - What kind of doctor did you say you were again? - The fun kind. Okay. John, what are you doing out here? - Hi, I need help with the AC. - Shit. - My room is freezing and I can't figure the darn thing out - so many buttons. Do you mind? - Sure. Sure, come with me. - Thanks. Okay. A... Cooper... Cooper... Cooper. Well, that should have been obvious. Okay. - Is it what you needed? - Yeah, it is. Thanks. There was just um, there is some things that I- I-I can't figure out. - Well, lay it on me. - As a physician, and your accomplice, I'm sworn to secrecy... also I am incredibly bored. Okay. Our decedent is female, thirties. She was in the process of leaving her husband when she disappeared and was never heard from again. - How do you know she's dead? - Well, we don't. But my friend has a hunch. Here. Trace amounts of high alkaline caustic soda were found in the driveway. - Lye? That's heavy duty stuff. He covered his tracks. - No, no, because it was trace amounts. Right? So if he had used it to clean we would have found more. - Maybe I'd start with tire tracks. Tire tracks seem nice. Simple. - John... you're a genius. - I am? - Yeah. - Okay. Ma... I don't even talk to Shane any more. Guy moved to Brunei, wherever the hell that is. - How did you and Shane become friends? I mean, Shane's got money, cool cars, cool clothes... and you're a security guard, Freddie? - I work in construction. - Yeah. But you were a security guard back then. I mean, no shame in that. My old man put food on our table working security. I'm just curious, how a guy like Shane ends up chillin' at the track with a rent-a-cop? - I answered all these questions back when Dyanne disappeared. Look, Bonnie was wasted. Spent most of the night puking in the bathroom. - There's another interesting detail. Drinks. Now according to his credit card statement, he bought a lot of drinks that night. Round after round. - That's what I'm saying. We were partying all night. - That's not the interesting part. Now all these drinks that Shane bought, were only ever for two drinks. That is until about 10:30, when it became three drinks. Now I know it was you and Bonnie, living it up on Shane's dime all night. Then after Shane killed his wife and got rid of the body, he joined you at the track for a few cold ones to celebrate. Is that about right? He used you, Freddie. You didn't know he was going to kill his wife. Did you? You didn't know, until it was too late. One sec. Tell me where the body is? Going once? - Hey. - Why would someone have industrial alkali in their home? - My guess is to clean up after a murder. - No. None of it was found inside. Right? I-I mean there would be  traces in the sink, in the garbage... somewhere. But do you remember the tire tacks that were in the driveway? - The-the lab determined that it belonged to a, a van... - Trying to find a "weight-bearing van" in a city this size, is like a needle in a haystack. - Yeah, but what if we can shrink that stack. - I'm listening. - The alkali was found in the driveway, right? But what if the weight-bearing van was a service vehicle. Used to, to transport corrosive material. - Cleaning supplies. - Yeah! If you narrow the list of companies selling products this strong-- - If we can find that van, maybe we'll find out where they took Dyanne's body - Yeah. Yeah. That's the idea. - And to think I almost didn't bother you today. - Jenny? - It's been a while so we may not find any trace of her. - Hello, sir. How are you today? - I'm fine, son. What can I do for you? - I'm Detective Donovan McAvoy, and I was hoping I could take a look inside this building. - Sorry, no-can-do. Not unless you got some official stuff? - No sir, I don't. Not yet. - Well, sorry, can't do it. - Well, thank you for your help. - Thank you. Have a good day. - Okay. I'll be back. - You two know each other? - No. He reminds me of my pops though. "Official stuff". Hey Jenny. - I mean, that was fast. Do you think it's the right place? - Might be. Freddie wasn't talking, but his girlfriend, Bonnie, remembered him doing deliveries for a company with a "C" logo. Easy find. Crestwall. And sure enough, they deliver industrial cleaning supplies. Freddie was moonlighting. - So that's why it didn't show up in the original investigation. - Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna need your help getting in here today though, security here is no joke. - Yeah. I will call in a coroner's warrant within the hour. - This is all I found in the janitor's closet. This one's pretty common, but these two... - Yeah. Yeah, these will do. - You do realize I keep coming out to Dundas just for the weirdness, right? And it never disappoints. - See, I was thinking that I was the reason that you kept coming back. My previous statement includes you. Yeah. - Okay. So I'm... I'm just like Mr. Wayward chicken here then? - Well, you are a little free-range. Said with love. - Okay. I'm going to give him five more seconds and then I... swarm. - Swarm? - Okay. Yeah. I-I got it. - If you swarm, just don't let him scratch you. - Hello. - They scratch. - He doesn't scratch. - Okay, just be careful. - Well, it's not scientist, scientific, you know. You were taking-- - They were scary! - They're not. You were scaring them. It was taking like an hour  before him. - You see this? Think that's scarring them?! - This guy. - Yeah. I know. I swarmed. Don't ever swarm. - But he-but he used to do what? - Name them. All of them. - The animals? - Yes. Liam thought that if the farm animals all had names, that we wouldn't eat them. - You're a regular Dian Fossey. - Did it work? - Um, mostly, no. But sometimes it felt more like we had pets than livestock. - You were very ahead of your time there, Liam. - There's nothing wrong with being sensitive. - But you toughened up? - You know, we-we had a vache, it's a cow. He named her Jacqueline. - Jacqueline. - And-and then there was a, there was a, a... Pierre, the pig. - Okay. - Then we had-we had two goats, they were both white. - Right. - Okay, he named them, Gertrude... Ger... I didn't expect this trail to be this hard. My legs are shot, my water's low. I'm moving on. - It's hard to let go. More so until they're found. Part of me doesn't want you to find her. Sometimes, I like to imagine that Dyanne did get away. That she's out there, somewhere, living her life. Some fantasy? - Hey Mac? Warrant came through. We're about ready to get at it. - Okay. I'll be there in a minute. I know you wanted to be here when we found her but-- - Actually, I changed my mind. I think I'd rather keep Dyanne alive just a little longer. - Alright. I'll... I'll have someone drive you back. Okay. - Jenny? - Mhmm. Wha-wh-what are you doing? - Are you out of you mind? Yeah. I get that question a lot? I just needed to make sure. - Sure of what? - I think I know what happened to Dyanne. - Over here. - Make sure Ident gets the okay to open these things safely. - Will do. How much you wanna bet one of these will match the drop found in the driveway? - You know I don't gamble. - Hey Jenny. We're about part way through. - He dissolved her, Donovan. - I'm sorry, what? - He didn't just use the supply van to get rid of her. He used the cleaning supplies as well. - But we haven't found any acids or anything like that. - No, acid, acid would be a lot quicker, but if you have a strong enough alkali, and you add water. I mean, it would just take a little bit longer. - Probably the same amount of time that Shane was missing from the track. Malik. - Hey, take a sample of that. - Jenny, if you went through the trouble to liquidate a body, what would you do with it? I know what I'd do. - I need Toronto Works to bring a jackhammer. Better get a cement cutter too. - So what's the process here? - Normally I'd outsource, but it turns out, our dear River here, holds a Journeyman's Plumbing license. - Yeah, well, scope and radar found matter in this section of the pipe. What's in there might be all that's left of Dyanne Tucci. - I'll be precise. Presto. - Congealed human fat, gallstones. And human teeth. Forensics can crack these open, extract DNA from the pulp. And you'll have more than enough for a positive ID. To think someone could reduce someone they supposedly love to this. Good work. Thanks, guys. - Sorry we missed Jenny, but we have a long drive home. - Yeah-yeah-yeah. It's okay. - We'll call first next time. - Sure. Sure. Oui. Hey farm boys, help me load the truck one last time?? - Watch out for the birds of prey. - Away, let's go. Allez. - Oui. - On s'appelle. - I reviewed the footage of you from today. - Okay. Look I... I know that I said I wouldn't work today, but I had to go and get that file. It helped me find a woman's body. - Is that so? - Yeah. Look... Okay. Just-- Please just promise me that you won't get John in trouble. I practically begged him to come with me. - John? - Yeah. - Who's that? - John. The other patient - goatee. - Please. There were no other patients at the clinic today. I mean, I was with John all day, and I saw other patients on the monitor so. - It's very common for subjects in this type of study to fall asleep for two to three hours without knowing. Sometimes they wake up in the middle, with a conscious and the subconscious overlapping. But to be clear, you never left your room. Come with me. I need to show you something. Come on. - No... - I know this isn't easy to watch, but I want you to try to remember what you were doing in this moment. - I'm sorry, I don't-I-I-don't... I don't know. - I think you do. - No. - Just try. Katie. No. - Reminds me of a poem. "One train may hide another." Sometimes, the thing you're looking at is blocking you from seeing the thing you need to see. But if you stay with it and look longer... the last piece of the puzzle... - Who are you, John? - Most people know me by one name... Fernandes. John Fernandes. - Hey, Jenny. I was just about to call you. Everything alright? - Yeah. Yeah. I... I have a, a question that I need to, to ask you and you promise me that you are not gonna ask me a question in return? - Okay. - Did we um... did we talk on the phone today? - Yeah, several times. - And did I, did I... did I help with the case? - Jenny, we couldn't have solved this case without you. Freddie cracked once we told  him what we found. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. - Hey, take care of yourself, alright? - Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. God! - I made it. It is so beautiful! Wooo! I'm Flora. - And I'm Tim. - This has been  "Slaughter into Wine". We dedicate this episode to Dyanne Tucci. - Salud, Dyanne. We remember you. - I get this terrible feeling that... I'm never gonna see you again. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - My parents visited today. - I'm sorry I missed them. - My mom she thinks that it was an accident, what happened with Mal. - I mean, she's gotta know that that's not the truth. Hey. Hey. I want you to talk to me. - Talk to me. - Everyone is upstairs. I'll be there in a minute, okay? Please. (Theme music from "Fernandes" plays) - Catch you on the flipside. - Hey-- - You're home. - Yeah. - Gordon. - Yeah. - Missing puzzle piece. - What? You're kidding! - Look at this! - I told you it'd show up. - Unbelievable. I'll take that 20 bucks. - That would have been a safe bet. Things are looking up for you, my friend. Things are looking up.
