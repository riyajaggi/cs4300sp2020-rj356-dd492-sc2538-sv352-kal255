Hunter ... She died? I think. It does not move. You killed the Beast. You are now the best fighter ... of London from below. The Warrior ... I do not feel my hands. Take me right hand. Can I still my gun in hand? Yes. Take it. It is yours. She always watched over me. But the washing of my blood. We must not let the rusty blade. A good hunter always takes care of its weapons.

Porte miss was a little ... uncompromising. I was asking Croup Vandemar and gentlemen ... ... of torture. But it does not feel a person who switches easily from view. Give us time. We break it. In any small pieces dripping. There is no time. However .. it gives me the impression someone ... to act to end the suffering of a friend. But it is wrong. Mal? He traveled so far of good and evil ... ... it would be unable to see the telescope by a beautiful clear night. Now Vandemar Mr, if you want to get the honor? You have the key, why do you need her? In condemning me to this place I was left the door of my prison. and took the key to the door ... ... and was placed here as well. An exquisite form of torture. The monks protected the black key against you. A key. A door. Someone to open the door. It was the three elements. A particularly fine joke. The idea is that when we decide I deserved clemency ... and freedom, on m'enverrait someone to m'ouvrir. I just decided to take management operations ... and go with a little advance. I first spoke with your father, Porte. He wanted to unify In London the Netherlands. I told him I help it helped me to turn. Then I confessed to him the nature of assistance I needed, ... I laughed in our face. He laughed ... ... me. You killed because he refused? I have not killed. I did killed. There was someone else there ... Mr Croup. I've already killed once. There are people who will never learn. You have said that he had died. This is the case. It was. I do not tolerate that I mente. How can you drive this? You're an angel. What I explained thee, Richard Mayhew? I told you that Lucifer was an angel. Lucifer? Lucifer was an idiot. He found himself lord and master of anything. While you, you'll lord and master ... two villains and a room full of candles. I was told that was my punishment for Atlantis. I told them it was an accident. There have been millions of deaths. They had won! These things happen. Chain it. My father told me that I could have confidence in you ... He told me to come here in his diary. It did not. It never did. We took the diary, we have improved ... ... You have made. "... m?fies up Islington ..." I thought my version you would come a little faster. Where will the door? Home. In heaven? And like that, you imagine nobody will see your return? They just say: "Oh, you've seen, there is an angel more !"... "Here, grab a harp and continue our Hosannas. "? It is not for me the suffering of adulation ... canticles, the aureoles and prayers research itself. I have my own goals. Well, now you have the key. And you're the one that opens. Without you, the key is useless. You should not do it! You killed his entire family. I would not harm any of you. Save me. It is sick. Oh, god ... Well, back to plan A. Cut him an ear. Today is your lucky day. Stop them! I'll open your door. Remember, I hold your friends. Give me the key. Door, do not! It never will. We do not. In fact, I count a lot. But I must approve. Do not do that. When I party ... ... kill them all the way you should. When I had my throne ... you have all the rewards ... that can design repugnant your small minds. And when the immensity of the creation m'appartiendra, and that all are gathered around my throne ... Hosannas to sing my glory ... ... I would reward the faithful and I chasten those that are abhorrent to me. This is not the sky! Dirty little crazy! What have you done? This was not the real key. It was a copy ... I made to market by Hammersmith. But it opened the door. No. I opened a door. So far and as hard as I could. I'll kill you! As you killed my family? I think you can never kill. Shut the door ... ... and I'll say where is your sister. She is still alive ... I killed your family. Not him! And now I'll finally finish the ... And where did you ship? I do not know. Very far.

And you are no longer in danger, right? Not anymore. And you? Have you got what you wanted? I think. Lady Porte owe me a favor very important. So ... What this happen to me? Who is going to bring me home? Who do you think it is? The Wizard of Oz? You can not go home. You are here with you now. There must be a solution! Where is the key? Door. I did not. I've furnished you in your back pocket during the last market. You mean that when I told Croup Vandemar and to that I had ... and they could if they wanted to search me ... I'd really? Oh, thin ... Guerrier, give me the key. You killed the beast. You are The Warrior. So after all this, I can not not always go home ... but as a consolation prize, I find myself ... on an archaic honorary list sub-soil? Look at all the good you have done. You have survived the ordeal. You have obtained the key. And what? You forged another ... I had not taken ... I could not make a copy without the original. You are all very foolish and you do not know anything. Richard is the master key. I did not need the key to heaven. This is the key to all the realities.
