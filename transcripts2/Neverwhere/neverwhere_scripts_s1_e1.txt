Good-bye - Bad news? - Yes!! Very bad. That's you, isn't it? The photograph's me. And you are... Doreen? I'm Door, Richardrichard-mayhewdick Milk and sugar? Richard... Just Richard. No sugar. Look, if this isn't a personal question... what happened to you? You don't want to know. Oh, well. I'm sorry. Richard. Honestly, you don't want to know. It wouldn't do you any good. You've done more than you should have already. Well. I mean. I couldn't just have left you there. You could have... You didn't. So where were you? Just now? I was here. Look, those two are still around. We need to get a message to... someone that can help. But, I don't dare leave here. Are they really your brothers? Please. Give me a break. Well, isn't there somewhere you could go? Someone that you could phone? My friends aren't on the phone. Breadcrumbs. Sorry? I don't see the point in this. I mean, it's not a homing pigeon. It's just a normal London pigeon, you know. The kind that craps on Lord Nelson. That's right. Okay Crrppllrr, you're looking for the marquis de Carabas. You got that? Attagirl. Now, this is important, you'd mustn't... Oh, I'm sorry. You know what you're doing, of course. Do you know, - ...it almost sounded like it understood you? - How about that. So, what are we waiting for? A reply. What kind of a reply? Listen, when those men came over... - Croup and Vandemar - Yeah They are not exactly men. Jesus! Richard! It's all right, it's okay, it's just a rat. Of course it was a rat. You scared it, poor thing. Hi! Are you okay. I'm sorry, he's an idiot. I'm not an idiot. It's a rat. Yes, it is. Are you going to apologize? What? Apologize. To a rat? I'm sorry, if I startled you. No, he really does mean it. He's not just saying it. Right. So what have you got for me? It's a message from de Carabas. Just follow this directions. Walk west of Oxford Street, turn left into Hanway Street left into Hanway Place then right again into Orme Lane. Stop at the second streetlight you come to This is the one. Then turn around thrice, widdershins. Widdershins is anticlockwise, Richard. Hello! Is anyone here? I'm Door's friend. Mine, I believe. De Carabas, at your service, and you are... You are Richard Mayhew, the young man who rescued our wounded Door. How is she now? She's fine. Her arm's still a bit... Her recovery time will undoubtedly astonish us all. Her family had remarkable recuperative powers. It's a wonder anyone managed to kill them at all, isn't it? Somebody killed Door's family? We're not going to get very far if... ...you keep... ...repeating everything I say, are we? Now then, sit down. She knows I don't come cheap. Why did she send for me? What's the deal. She said that she wants you to accompany her home... - wherever that is... - Yes ...and she wants you to fix her up with a bodyguard. And she's offering? Well. Nothing. She's offering me. Nothing. Well, she didn't say anything about money. She just said she'll have to owe you a favour. Exactly what kind of favour? A really big one. She said she'll have to owe you a really big favour. Did you leave her on her own? - Yes... With Croup and Vandemar out there? Well, what are you waiting for? Come on. I'll need to get her to the market. The next one's in, mm, two days' time, if I recall correctly, as of course I unfailingly do. I can hide her until then. Market? The Floating Market. But you don't want to know about that. - Why? - No more questions. There's a little something I need to organize first. Insurance. And when we get into daylight, don't look down. Why not? Somebody, wasn't listening, was he? I... I can't move. Of course you can move. Or, if you don't you can stay here until your legs freeze and tumble to a rather messy death. Bastard. Old Bailey. What a delightfully unexpected surprise running into you here. You're not wanted here, de Carabas. Get away. You're looking wonderfully healthy. And ain't that a new hubble or have you redecorated? Charming. You all right, laddie? I've got some bird cookin' back there. You want some? It's rook. No thank you. I don't recognize ye. What barony do you give fealty to? What's your name? Shut up. Don't say another word. People who put their noses where they aren't wanted sometimes lose them. Now. You've owed me a favour for twenty years, Old Bailey. A big favour. And I'm calling it in. - I was a fool. - Yeah. No fool like an old fool. Do you know what this is? I wish I didn't. Keep it safe for me. I don't want it. You don't have any choice. Right. We'd better get a move on, hadn't we? Can I ask a question? No. You don't ask any questions. You don't get any answers. You don't stray from the path. You don't even think about what's happening to you right now. Got it. Excuse me. I know that this is a personal question. but, are you clinically insane? That's very unlikely, why? Well. One of us must have be. Mind your head. Not at her best. Richard, you did it. Well, yes. My Lady. Oh, do get up, de Carabas. I'm pleased you came. My pleasure, madam. Your offer was quite acceptable. Later. Richard. Thanks. You're going? I'll be safe now. More or less. I hope. Where are you going now? I'm out of your life. And you've been wonderful. Wait! What if I need to get in touch with you--? You don't. Ever. I'm sorry, okay? No. Don't be sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about. It was... fun. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Come on! Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe what it was like getting here. It was a nightmare. - Over there. - So weard. What is going on? I'm sorry? The desk. Where are they taking my desk. Gary. Gary. What's going on? Is this some kind of joke or something? Gary, this is not funny. I don't know what everyone's playing at. If I've been fired then just tell me I've been fired, but all this pretending I'm not here... Hi. I'm Gary Perunu. Can I help you? No. I don't think so. Jess... Jessica. Thank God. I think I'm going mad or something. Look, I'm really sorry about the other night. but you wouldn't believe what's been happening to me. I'm sorry. You're going to think I'm absolutely awful, I know we've met before but I have a really dreadful memory for faces. Yes, Mrs. Simmons. Tomorrow we'll get the lady into clearing the previous tenants accoutrements We can pick up the keys from my office then. That's right. Excuse me. I live here. This is not happening. Hello? Mister Mayhew? Yes You can hear me. Oh thank God. Who is this? My partner and I met you on Saturday. We were making enquiries as to the whereabouts of a certain young lady. Do you remember? Oh, yes. It's you. Mister Mayhew. You said that Door wasn't with you. We have reason to believe that you were embroidering the truth more than perhaps a little. Well, you said you were her brother. All men are brothers, Mister Mayhew. She's not here anymore. And I don't know where she is. We know that. We are perfectly cognizant of both of those facts. And to be magnificently frank, Mister Mayhew-- And you want me to be frank, don't you? Were I you, I would no longer worry about the young lady. Her days are numbered, and the number in question isn't even in double digits. Look. Why are you calling me? Mister Mayhew, do you know what your own liver tastes like? I'm calling the police. You can't threaten me like this. Mister Mayhew. You may call anyone you wish. But I'd hate you to think we were making a threat. Neither myself nor Mister Vandemar make threats, do we Mister Vandemar? Oh, No? Then... what the hell are you doing? We're making you a promise. And we know where you live. You knew. Bastards. You knew this would happen. Oh, no! Can you spare any change? Here. Keep it. There's about fifteen hundred pounds in there, if you can get to it. Oh, Well. Thank you very much. That and sixty pence'll get me a nice cup of coffee. You can see me. There's nothing wrong with my eyes Listen, have you ever heard of a place called 'The Floating Market'? I need to get there. There's a girl called Door. Look, I really need help. Please? Okay, I'm sorry I troubled you. Hey, Come on, down here, Quickly. So, why can you see me... ...when no one else can. Is not that they can't see you. They see you... ...but they don't look at you. They don't notice you and by the time you turn the corner they've forgotten all about you. Happened the same to me. Where are you taking me. Down. Some people I think you ought to see. What? What is it? What is this? Who've you brought us, Iliaster? Talk. Talk. TALK! He's from Upworld. Asking questions about Floating Market. ...and Door. I brought him to you, Lord Rat-speaker. I figured you'd know what to do with him. Oh yes. Yes. I know exactly what to do with him.
