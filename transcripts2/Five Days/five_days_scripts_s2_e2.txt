 Five Days (2007–2010): Season 2, Episode 2 - Day 2 - full transcript 
 Laurie discovers that Michael's blood group is peculiarly Asian and,although it does not match the dead youth's, his finger-prints are found on the baby's buggy,which Colly and Didi discover,abandoned in the hospital grounds.It also contains a Muslim prayer for protection. Mal's son, who lives with his estranged wife, was playing by the railway lines, and took a photo showing that the dead youth was actually pushed,at which point Laurie's superior,Carpenter, takes over the case. D.C. Choudhury answers an appeal and names the corpse as an illegal Afghani immigrant and drug-pusher, probably killed in a gangland revenge. Whilst Laurie is surprised to find Jen has brought home Gerry, a man they met on the train, Nuss - hopeful to adopt Michael - discovers her brother Khalil agitated and blood-stained.

 You can't park that car here, miss. And you can't ride that bike here. So that makes us both villains. SCREAMING BRAKES SCREECH Where is your maman? Why did his mother leave him in the disabled toilet? Why not the ladies? Why not the gents? Nobody would leave a baby in the gents. Not even a caveman would leave a baby in the gents. The body under your train wasn't his mother. You don't know that. It wasn't anybody's mother. The driver was deceived by the clothes.

 Your train hit a man. There's you. There's that lady what jumped off. And there look, it's a person. There is a person on the bridge behind her. BABY CRIES Ow! I'm sorry. I was just looking for a kettle. I'm sure the nurses must have one here somewhere. Isn't he beautiful? Yeah, yeah, he is. Lovely. Can I pick him up? Why don't we just get you back to bed? Sweet. Oh! LAUGHTER FROM TV

 Bye, dad. Got owt to eat? No, we've got nowt. There's got to be toast. Every bugger's got toast. He always leaves me some money. Bastard! Pockets. No! No! Come on, Ross. My dad'll go mental. No, don't. Come on! Ross, Ross... Come on! After taking a first account from the driver without authorisation, this officer took it upon herself to lead a passenger evacuation of the train. No, the train evacuated itself, sir, quite forcibly. Besides, nobody died. Apart from the bloke in a burqa. I think you will find the correct term is jilbab, not burqa. If you're going to give me a bollocking, could you be the only person to remember it's my birthday? Come with me. BTP accept that yesterday's evacuation... I didn't evacuate the train! ..was conducted safely and without injury. But... Private enough for you? Yes, sir. Thank you sir. ..but this officer was responsible for a potential compromise to the Article Two rights. Open brackets... I breached whose human rights? ..open brackets, rights to life, closed brackets, in that she led those passengers from a train without due regard for their health and safety. Much to detain you in the Criminal Justice Admin Unit today? Take a job car. Get down to the Queen Mary's quick enough, you'll catch them in the morgue. Your new best friends have specially requested your input. Happy birthday, Laurie. ♪ Girls will be boys and boys will be girls ♪ It's a mixed up muddled up, shook up world ♪ I said Lola... ♪ Not many laughs in your job? ♪ L-O-L-A L-L-L-La-Lola... ♪ Doesn't give up, does he? Oh, the headlines. "Burqa Boy!" There won't be any headlines. There's no way he can compete for attention today. Hey, big boy, less of that. You're going to be in the paper today. Going to get your mummy to come and find you. She'll have a job! She'll not get through security. You're joking, aren't you? That old woman got in here this morning. Frightened the life out of me. Now who's being an old woman? That cleaner got in last night, too, the one that found him? I didn't see policemen then either. BABY GRIZZLES Oi, you haven't paid for that. Get back. What are you doing? Oi! Oi! I'll get bobbies on to you! Ha! Try it! I'm ringing them now! On telly there's bobbies everywhere. And ribbons round everything. "Crime scene. Do not pass". And sirens. And blue flashing lights. What if nobody knows except us? Just shut up about it, yeah? And no grassing. How's it grassing? My dad says never talk to no police. Never. It were that horrible kid off the estate again. But you did nothing about it last time. Come on. HORN BLOWS Come on, you loser! > If it's any comfort, it's easy enough to see how the confusion arose. He looks so young. Cheeks like a girl. Any clues on that? On his age? Difficult. I need to see some X-rays, check the fusion of his bony epiphysis. I don't know, mid-teens? We need to find the parents. Could be thousands of miles away. We need to ID this kid. I need to take a look at the scene. So, do we know who our little jumper was yet? Lola was an IC3 male, age to be determined. Pending toxicology, death was caused by over-familiarity with a train. Lola? You don't really think he were a trannie though? Trannies don't cover themselves up. It spoils the whole point. I wouldn't know. He could have been using it as a disguise. There were that reporter wangled his way into Baghdad wearing a burqa. Not sure how that's a good tactic for wangling your way into Leeds. But what do you think? I like to ask the right questions of the right people before I think anything. And what about the baby? The baby's not our job, is he? He is if Lola's his father. Can I remind you that when Lola was a girl, she couldn't have left the baby here due to the fact that she was being smashed by a train at the very same moment. Do you remember that? Now that Lola's a boy, that fact still remains. And if you don't mind, I've got to go and find him a new name. Burqa Boy! But this was a jilbab, not a burqa. PC Franklin, Burqa Boy and Buggy Baby are two different jobs. OK? One of them's mine and none of them are yours. So what exactly did you want from me for today? I wanted your service report for the incident yesterday. You didn't have to leave your desk. I keep thinking what if he pushed her. Just stop thinking about it. What if he pushed that lady right off that bridge? Oh, shut up about it! Hello, Ross. Run! Ross! Run! Ross! Come on, run! Run! Ross? Oi. So, who are you then? And where's your friend? You don't need to be scared. I'll take you home, if you like. Oh, Christ! Bastard... Bastard! Morning. Hey. Hey. Can't keep away, can you? When do you get to take him home? Soon as his 24-hour observations are done, I hope. There'll be people fighting to adopt him. Yes, but five quid says he's mixed race, or dual-heritage as we're supposed to call it these days. They'll be looking for one white parent and one Asian and they'll start fretting about whether the family should be Muslim, if the set up is Muslim enough... It's being so cheerful keeps you going. You like happy endings. I like putting my knives in the knife drawer and my spoons in the spoons drawer. Are these his notes? Does the idea of medical confidentiality mean anything to you, officer? Is it blood group AB? Yeah, you should have heard the racket he made when she took the sample. That's quite rare, isn't it? Yeah, I think so. Most people in England are blood group O. But AB's more common in Asia, apparently. What are you plotting? HORN BLOWS There's no evidence of a scuffle. There's no evidence anything happened here. No CCTV cameras, no buildings overlooking the track. No bus stop. PHONE RINGS We'll have to work hard for witnesses. DI Craig. 'It's Laurie Franklin.' Listen, the baby's AB. Yeah. Is that catching? Blood group AB. So, did you get a blood group for Lola? 'Would there be a point to that?' Given all the transfusions he'll need when they sew him up? He can't have left the baby at the hospital, but they could be related. 'It's a blood group, it costs nothing.' 'Tell you what,' do it to prove I'm wrong. Do it cos it's my birthday. Supercilious git! Oi! Come on, put it down. Yeah, right, thanks, Natalie, speak to you soon as. Just hold on, I'll put you through. Those two lads conductor saw? We just had a report about two lads thieving close to our scene. Could be the same kids. Good one. PHONE RINGS He looked more alive this morning. Thanks a bunch! Took me ages, that. DI Craig? OK, thanks a lot. They've SGM plussed him against the DNA database. No match. Lola's not a criminal, then. Or not one we've ever nicked, no. Mr Nobody. There's no evidence that a crime's been committed here at all. So all we're after is an ID to put a name to him, and a family to break the news to. And I don't want to make that harder we have to. I don't think we need to mention what he was wearing. It wouldn't do to start upsetting the Muslims now. Shut up, Don. RADIO PLAYS Thanks for taking me, Dad. I'm a poppet, and no mistake. Prove it. Find me an ice cream. Oh, I can find you better than that. His mother will come back for him. It's obvious. Not if she's dead, Nusrat! Not if that were her, what Danny ran over with his train! It doesn't work like that, you can't just... Walk in off the street and say "I'm Asian, I'll have him", why not? Why not just ask them? Look at him. What you don't ask for in this world, you don't get. Dad, please, not today! Oi! Oi! Out the way! Mascara all down my face. The adoption panel are going to love me. Oh, love. Can you imagine someone leaving her beautiful little baby? Imagine, someone throwing himself in front of a train. But it's easy, isn't it? Especially in the night. Arms up for me please. Thank you. All last night I had that poem going through my head. "To cease upon the midnight with no pain". Who wrote that? John Keats. We did him at school. So did we. Drop your arms, please. Thank you. Morning. What's up? I can feel sad if I like. Vale of tears, this is. My daughter was a beautiful baby, doctor. She's lying. I've seen the photographs. 37 years ago today and the sun was shining. Come on, you can take me home. Yes? Absolutely. It's dirty, this hospital. You could catch your death. I've seen it on the news and so have you. Terrorists pretending to be doctors. So, is he older than you or younger? Your brother, Michael. He died in the war. There's nothing else to say. No! Listen, Didi, I'm trying to put together a memory box for him. Everything I can find out about how Michael came to us. Photos and quotes and people to remember, for when he's old enough to ask questions. Imagine if he had no idea? Imagine that. No history, no family. Don't you want our baby to know something about the man he was named after? You may take my photograph. You're going to have to find a big smile from somewhere. Didi? What is it? Dr Haydar knows I didn't mean him. He hasn't got one of those beards, has he? We talked about poetry. What are those two doing hanging around your car? No! No! Leave it. Don't touch that! Get away from her car! Mum, shut up! No. You're ruining any fingerprints. Look. Leave it be. Don't touch it. What is it? Is it from his mother? I've no idea. What does it say? I'm guessing it says "please look after this bear." In Arabic. What if my dad's right? What if we don't ask, and someone else adopts him? Here are the questions the panel will be asking. Thanks. And don't worry. What are the main ways you think adoption will change your lives? Doh! We'll be parents. I really don't think it's a good idea to mention that baby in there today, Nuss. No. OK. Do it their way. Yeah? Mmm. God, he said he'd be five minutes. I'll get the bus. You can't get the bus. I know I'm a burden, but you could try a bit harder to hide it. Oh, he's here. Hello again, ladies. She's got something with her, just in case. Oh, you do fuss! I'll see you later, Mum. All aboard. I'll ice your cake, but I'm not up to cooking tonight. I'll bring a Chinese. We'll have cake for afters. Are you buckled up, love? Yes. Well, it seems to fit. That wheel's completely knackered. Found him. I wondered if you could help us with this, Dr Haydar. "I seek refuge in the Lord of day break." That a poem? These are verses from the Holy Qur'an. We write such words on a piece of paper and attach them around the neck of a newborn child to keep him from evil and harm. Nothing to help us identify Michael or his parents? I am sorry to disappoint you, but there is no personal message here. Proves this child is a Muslim. You don't know that. You don't know anything about him. SPEAKS IN ARABIC Can you just wait? The Adhan should be the first thing a newborn hears in his life. What harm can it do? Fine. RECITES PRAYER PHONE RINGING No, no grandchildren, I'm sorry to say. There was always plenty of boyfriends, none of them any use. There was even a husband once. She went off down south after him and we hardly saw her for years. Must be nice having her back home. Mmm. It's only cos she's decided I'm doolally and need looking after. Two women, one kitchen. This is the one. Ah. Right. Thank you. Bet she tells you loads they don't tell us in the papers. Nah. She never tells me anything. What about that girl then, what went under your train? Oh, can you keep a secret? To the grave. There was no girl. I thought maybe it was her that left that baby in the hospital, yesterday, you remember? You're as bad as my daughter! Of course I remember. I'm not senile! What I'm saying is, it wasn't a girl. It was a boy. Dressed in women's clothes. Your face! Thanks for the lift. Bye. PHONE RINGS All right, love? Put Danny on, he'll never guess what... SOBBING Don't cry, love, what...? What? Dad we got through. We're in. We're on the list. Dad, we're accepted! Thanks be to God, we're going to have a baby. 'Oh, love.' Oh, love. Oh! Hey, hey. That's Don Parker's desk and I don't think he'll be too happy. Social worker got her mitts on it, but I got prints. You think you're going to eat our biscuits? You've got biscuits? Where? Don't worry, I'll do your service report and then I'll slink back to the pen-pushing hell hole I came from, never to be seen again. Biscuits? I've got good news for you. This is my interested face. This is my very interested face. 10.05 yesterday morning. Four minutes before Lola jumped. Michael's mother? Yeah. See what you mean. Is this personage male, female, or other? Don's opened a book on that. So, what's the bad news. No, all good news today. I did your blood group test, and guess what? Lola is blood group O. And there's no way a man with blood group O can father a child with blood group AB. Lola is not Michael's dad. Fingerprints? Belt and braces? Belt and braces! They are not related in any way shape or form. So you're saying, don't give up the day job. I lied about those biscuits. We haven't got any. The pub across the road does a mean Thai fishcake, if you fancy it? You can buy me a pint, you know, for being right all along. I'm not much company when I'm losing. I'm going for a fag. See you outside. Hello. Where's your mate? Thought you two were joined at the hip? What are you doing standing out in the rain? You never said you're a bobby. You never asked. Are you coming in? Find that, did you, love? What are you doing here? Sorry, Dad. Dad? Come on, let's get you dry. Sodding rain now. That's all we need, eh? Tits up from the off, this job. Hope you didn't have plans for this weekend? Bindweed. In my mum's roses. It's a shame, but I guess it'll have to wait. My first murder north of Watford. That's for you to decide, is it? I'm not deciding, sir, I'm simply suggesting shyly, on the basis of mobile phone evidence showing someone pushing Lola off this very bridge. We don't know what it shows yet. But yes, I am treating this as a murder enquiry, for now. I'm going to send Don with you to interview this train driver. I don't need minders! Yes, you do. He will come out with a load of technical stuff you don't understand. All I want to know is if he saw more than one person on the bridge. How technical is that? Dad! Can we go home yet? Short of locking him up. Lot of fuss over a couple of lads nicking some sweets, in'it? DC Franklin, DI Craig. Can you spare me five minutes? Yeah, sure. Sorry, you are...? Mr Hassan. Of course. It's just a couple of routine questions. All right. OK. Shall we go inside? Yeah, come in. One day. That's all I needed, Luke, was for one day you to stay at home and behave yourself. Were you on the train track when the person jumped? No. You've been nicking out of this guy's shop though, haven't you? Luke? No. Did you kick that policewoman? Who were you with, mate? I wasn't with Ross, all right. I never seen him, not all week. That's four lies you've told me in less than a minute. I saw Ross on your mobile phone, didn't I?! Can we go for chips? I'm starving. Yep, come on. But get up here. I'm not a bloody taxi driver. Yeah, it were a funny noise, like... ..shoo. Shoo. Not like you'd immediately think, "Oh, there's a sound of a train doing an emergency stop. Apart from that you didn't hear or see anything? Never see nowt all day. Plenty of kids to man the shop till they all go off to bloody college. OK, thanks, Mr Hassan. Just before, though, right before, I were serving this customer. She came in for a couple of cans of pop. I heard a car screeching off in that direction. Left in a right hurry. Left some skid marks an'all. 90 miles an hour it sounded like. Someone you know? Never seen her before in my life. The point is you kicked a lady and you told me a whole lot of lies about where you were and who you were with. It's not on, mate. The truth is what I like, you know that. You'll never get into trouble for telling me the truth. So what were you doing there, eh? Even after I told you not to? There's wires that runs down the tracks. They're made out of copper. Christ Almighty, Luke! Is that what Ross' dad does for a living now, nicks copper wires? You stay away from that lad, do you understand me? God knows what your mum will say. You don't have to tell her. Yeah, I think I do. I'm going to tell her. I want to stay here with you. It's not up to me, is it? Only could we get some bread and milk and that a bit more often? I'll think about it. No, you're all right. There, do you see? Just there. That little flicker coming from behind? No, I mean... We can't be sure. Do you want crisps? No. Yeah, go on, then. Smokey bacon. I still can't work that out myself. Can you get me a cheese and pickle? No butter. Do you mind? I've only just got rid of that bloody baby buggy! You see, her arms are out like this, by the looks of it. But is she pushing? Pulling? Restraining? What makes you think it's a woman? Mr Hassan had a woman in his shop before Lola went off the bridge. Can't remember much about her. Her car left some pretty good skid marks though. So she was in a hurry. What are you doing on the PNC? Checking the number plate of that dodgy car that drove past us outside the shop. That's odd. Yeah. Oi! Headlines. IC3 male, about 15 years old. Why did we think it was suicide? The driver saw him jumping off the bridge. And now we think it's murder because...? MOBILE PHONE VIDEO PLAYS Person who took this. Just some kid. My kid. My son, he was playing around where he shouldn't be, you know? What ho, big city girl, never seen an SIO in a uniform before? Not entirely seeing one now, am I? My pride and joy, this uniform. Which is why it's going back in the locker till I sort your nice mess out. And while I'm pretending to be a detective, it's my ambition to look as smart as you lot. Shove them in that bag, and come with me. We've got a lovely new incident room to set up. With all due respect, sir, this is a British Transport Police job and I'm the senior investigating officer. Not any more. You can't cope. The lad died on Network Rail land. The bridge he went off belongs to the Highways Agency. Come on, Mal, transport police? Three men and a dog, and I lied about the dog. Right, what did our young witness actually see? Nothing. He was arsing around on his phone. He didn't even know what he had till after. ABE interview, child protection. Tick all the boxes, including the one that says you don't go near this. Am I to interview the driver now, sir? No, not you, I want it done properly, here. You're a level three interviewer, yes? This one, you do. From now on you work for me. He's a significant witness and I want him on video. Right, this is a county force job now and we're up and running. Let's get to work. I could murder a cup of tea. Hello, darling. Who's in charge around here? I'm Superintendent Carpenter. Can I help you? I'm Detective Constable Bilal Choudhry, and you've got something that belongs to me. Farid Sardar was an illegal immigrant from Afghanistan. Came over in the back of a truck about a year ago. Fetched up on our manor, dealing class A. Now he was starting to get really useful. Then a week ago... he stopped answering his phone. Gang thing, yeah? They found out he was informing. What about the women's clothes? That a gang thing as well? Mmm. Punish him. Humiliate him. Wipe him from the face of the earth. Is there anything we actually know about him? Not much. I don't even know if Farid Sardar is his real name. The Home Office pathologist said he was in his early teens. No. No, no, no, no. I thought you didn't know anything about him? Well, I know he's over 18. Definitely over 18. BABY CRIES Where's he gone? Home to the seaside. There you are, nice and clean again. Oh, here she is. Here's your big sister. Hello, darling. Thanks very much. See you soon. See you. Look at this. Look what we've got. Do you want to give him a kiss? Oh, he likes that. What's his name? Michael. Michael? Think it suits him? Yeah. He's vice, definitely vice. So that guy Bilal - it's got to be drug squad. This'll be cos he's a flash git in designer kecks, yeah? No I'm a trained observer, me! Yeah, right. CHIS handler is my guess. Running our Lola as an informant. He'll have seen our misper report somewhere, panicked, then got himself sent over here to clean up his mess. That's enough to get our case taken off us. Us? What's this "us"? You're from Criminal Justice, Admin. I must have been something really wicked in a previous life. What I want to know is how your DI stands it. Getting his sorry little arse kicked off his own jobs every time they get big enough to be interesting. Sir? I've got someone downstairs who particularly wants to talk you. Sir. Hiya, Pat. Hiya. Are you OK? Yeah. Thinking about the pitch of the bridge. You're going about what? At 35, and the light were on green. I were picking up speed. And just think. I'm sorry, I know this is difficult, but... ..did you see her before she jumped? I mean, did you see her before she moved? Or was she in movement the entire time? I remember her eyes. Really pretty eyes, she had. Not dark, not really dark. More sort of...green. Pat. Was she on her own? Sorry. My mind's just a fog. I'm sorry. It's OK. When we spoke on the train... I told you it were my first one. Yeah, I'm wondering why you did that. Well, that's why I wanted you here. I need to speak to that policewoman, I said. You know I need to explain to her. That girl, she launched herself at me, you know? She come right at me, I told you, and she was looking right at me. I remember. Yeah. And it was the same last time. This woman walked out in front of me, and she stood there. Last year this was. And she looked straight at me. And everyone said, "No, Pat, no, it's the train she were looking at, mate, it's the train, not you." But the train and me, we're the same, right? At that moment, to her, we were the same. And now I can't get it out of my head, there's got to be a third. They go in threes, right? Bad things go in threes. And I'll have the deaths of three women on my conscience. Look, listen mate. This is going to come out eventually so it's best you know now. It might be easier. The person who was killed wasn't a woman. It were. No. It was a young lad. It's all right. Thank God! Oh, thank God for that. 'I mean, he looked relieved.' Well, people never react the way you expect them to, do they? I know. But even so... Useless. Fruitcake, he was. We've got guests. How's the driver? Peculiar. In shock? Even more peculiar. He thought he could see the colour of her eyes. Who's that? That's your new Intel Cell. DC Kevin Cunliffe making himself at home. Hi! Can I have a word? I don't think I can work like this. Parker, do you know where that CCTV stuff is? Yeah. If this is about your son, I don't see a problem. It's all thoroughly disclosed. It's not. I'm saying I can't do this job blindfolded. It's on a need-to-know basis, I get it. But I need to know if we'll work together. We've got an Afghan boy, a suspicious death. Security threat level stuck on "severe". And now these two turning up claiming to be my Intel Cell. And maybe they are just ordinary 'tecs, but do you know what? His suits fit a bit too well. They're on secondment. Where from? The security services? From Leeds! Is this a terrorist job? Mal, you're worrying about the wrong thing. Pathologist just confirmed Lola was 16 max, probably younger. So, what, they've recruited a child as a covert human intelligence source then taken their eye off the ball and got him murdered? You know what? I hope that little bastard loses his job. If every CHIS handler obeyed every rule, we'd be waving a sad goodbye to useful intelligence. Bilal is a good officer. His boss will have his ears for carpet slippers for a bit, and we'll sweep up after him. Here. This might cheer you up. "Do it cos it's my birthday", you said. "Do it to prove me wrong." What? Fingerprints? Two eliminated sets. Yours and the social worker. One, unidentified. And one... Is Lola? Lola and the baby are not related in any way, shape or form. He's still not the father though. The blood group proved that. His sticky fingers are all over that baby's buggy. "Smug cow" is not such a good look for you. No? I think it suits me. Hello you. PHONE RINGS "This is Jenny Mason. "Please leave a message and I'll ring you back later." PHONE BEEPS 'Mum? Mum, are you there? 'Pick up, please. 'OK, never mind, I'm just calling to say I'm really sorry but I'm going to be late. 'And I've not forgotten - I'm bringing a Chinese. 'So get the candles on my cake lit! Love you.' Boss, if Lola had his fingerprints on Michael's buggy, and Lola was informing to the Drugs Squad... Come in, why don't you? How did you work that out? I ran that DC's car registration on the PNC. It came up blocked. All enquiries to a DI in Leeds. Tell me you didn't ring the DI. I didn't have a chance. You turned up and started taking your clothes off. Anyway, look, if Lola... Farid Sardar. If Farid Sardar was a drugs CHIS, means the baby had some dodgy people hanging round his cot, yeah? So maybe whoever left him at the hospital, maybe they were trying to do him a favour. Maybe they were trying to keep him out of trouble. OK, good. Maybe as long as you remember your job is to gather evidence and not make up stories. OK. Bet I'm right, though. Hey. Can't get rid of you. He's doing his interview. I already told it all to my dad. I told you that's not good enough. You don't get into trouble, you don't get interviewed, right? Come on, lad. This won't hurt. Sir. No, no, I just remember my mum once telling us a story about Sheikh Haamaad, may Allah have mercy on him, who was a really holy scholar, like, 500 years ago. And if Haamaad didn't want to sit next to some boring person, he'd go, "Ow! My tooth, my tooth", so the boring person would leave him alone, but he didn't have toothache at all. So a good Muslim doesn't always have to tell the truth? Right. Well...thanks everyone, until next week, I ask Allah, the most merciful, to give us a proper understanding of our religion, to guide and to protect us from the evils of our own selves. Mum? Mum? Sorry I'm so late... Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum, are you there? 'I can't take your call at the moment. Please leave a message. Thank you.' Mum? You dirty stopout, where are you? It's me. It's gone nine o'clock and I'm here with our birthday dinner and... Mum, could you give me a call? There's someone here. Ve are not alone! Oh, Laurie you're back. You know, it's years since I've been to the Coach and Horses. Next time we go, we must take you with us, Laurie. Wonderful wine list these days. Come on, love, I'll put kettle on. Mum, I've been worried sick! Why? How did you know where she lives? Well, you know. We swapped mobile numbers on the train. The way people do. Why? You got a problem with that? Should I have? Gerry? Are you coming? Your mother doesn't need a babysitter. She's not well. Come on. We'll go in the living room. Well, it looks like you'll have to be getting used to me, Laurie.
