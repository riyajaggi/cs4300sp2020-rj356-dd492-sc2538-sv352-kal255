 Five Days (2007–2010): Season 2, Episode 3 - Day 8 - full transcript 
 Michael takes ill in the hospital and the diagnosis is suspected methadone withdrawal. A week after the murder and there are no leads. A reconstruction is staged where Laurie is annoyed by Gerry's interference and stroppy Muslim passenger Jamal Matthews accuses her of inciting Islamophobia. An old lady alerts Laurie to the disappearance of her neighbours on the day of the incident - a man and two women. Farid's shoe is found in their car but was apparently also worn by someone else. Nuss disowns Khalil to the adoption officer and soon afterwards their father,Ibra, finds images of Khalil with a Taliban-type group on his computer following Khalil's visit to Pakistan,allegedly to study. At the same time Khalil is meeting Jamal Matthews.

 This programme contains some strong language. What are you doing? What the bloody hell does it look like? This is unlawful imprisonment. See that lad down there? Do you think he's a terrorist? I remember her eyes. Really pretty eyes she had. Sort of...green. Can you keep a secret? It was a boy dressed in women's clothes! Your face! Farid Sardar was an illegal immigrant from Afghanistan. There'll be people fighting to adopt him.

 No, no. 'Put him on, please.' 'That's Ross, isn't it?' BANGING ON DOOR Police, open up! Open this door now. Don't let them in, Ross! It's the Police. Open this door or we are coming in, do you understand? MUFFLED SHOUTING Ross! Dad! Dad! Come on! Come on! That's it. Hey, come on, we've got to go. Give us your hand. Come on. Well done! I warned you, didn't I? I kept up! Yes, you kept up really well. Can we do some more? Another time. Hey, look, you must be starving now. Yeah! Go on and get changed. I'll be with you in a minute. Putting me into care? It's just for today, Ross. Just while we're talking to your dad. Hey, look at me. Be one of the good guys today! Where is it?! I know it's here somewhere. Shall I ring it up for you? No, I swear it's got little invisible legs. There it is, bloody thing. OK. I'll see you later. What about your toast? Love you! Oh, that girl! Oh, and Mum... Yes, I know, put a sock in it, because walls have ears. Oh, and careless talk costs lives. Oh, I say! You're cheerful this morning. Shall I not expect you for your tea? Bye! Mmm! 'Jen! Pick up, love. Pick up! 'I'm still here. Come on, love! Jen! Jen!' Hello? Oh, Gerard, I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. Oh, I don't know which way's up this morning. 'Don't you worry about it, lass. 'Has she gone?' Yes. Those bosses of hers are slave drivers. So I've got a lot on today. I mean, more than usual. So I don't want any phone calls about you, all right? You're staying put, Yeah? OK. You know what will happen if you don't, don't you? Yeah, you'll tear me limb from limb. So you promise me, then. I promise. Go on, you better get off. I'll take that. Give us a kiss. You're joking?! Yeah, go on. Go on. Morning, Luke. How are you? Morning. Morning. You all right? Morning. You OK? You're late. Where's my DI? How should I know? So that wasn't you and him I saw getting into a taxi last night, then? Oh, don't get your hopes up, any of you. I never shag policemen. I'm a lesbian! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ♪ Lola L-O-L-A, Lola ♪ I said Lo... ♪ Half the Muslim community has already taken its bat home on this job, so you can all stop arsing around and start taking this reconstruction seriously. And for the last time, it can't be her, cos even in a burka, a woman doesn't walk the same. What, even if she's a lesbian? You want the job, Cunliffe? Boss, can I cover my face? For God's sake! Now tell me, there's no such thing as bad publicity. It's my job to get you into the papers, remember. This didn't come from the press office. Any idea how they got hold of it? I gave her a right mouthful. She did cry. How much do I care about that? Sorry. Am I having a senior moment here? While we were busy preparing our community impact statement and working out with great sensitivity exactly how and when to make the cross-dressing public... My mum told her taxi driver that Lola was a boy. He told everyone he knows. And he knows everyone. Great. Damage limitation time. Right. COMMENTARY ON RADIO All right, kids. In you get. Budge up. We've a long way to go this morning. ..Morning, love! Couple of hours you can see your dad. Town centre first. Then prison. There's the receipt. I think that's it. Is there anything else I can help you with? ..Thanks. Bye. I told you the answer's no. I'll pay you back next week. No. Get a job. You've changed, Nusrat. Go home, Khalil, and don't bother me at work. You used to be someone who always put your family first. You used to be a sister worthy of the name. What gives you the right to talk to me like that?! I'm your brother. I'm responsible for you. My brother. So the minute Mum gets ill, you run away to Pakistan to play at being a boot boy. I was studying. You should show more respect. Studying what? How to be an idiot? I should never have let you marry that Kafir. My husband is a better man than you'll ever be! Do you hear me, Khalil?! Dad? Don't you get involved. Dad! What are you doing? Are you OK? I tossed and turned a bit. But, yeah, still here. Didn't happen to me, did it? Not like it happened to my driver. Morning! Gerard. Don't mind me - I'm just here to help. Did my mother put you up to this? You know what you want to do, Laurie? You should try them new detention centres. You know, where they have the asylum seekers and the illegal immigrants and whatnot. You'll find we've done that. And asking round the Asian parts of town, cos, you know, I bet they're keeping shtoom about this. Yes, Gerard, we've done that too. We've not been completely asleep all week. Just a few ideas, like. Cos your mum tells me that you're getting absolutely nowhere yet. Sorry I'm late! Child care, you know. But I'll get off after them now. There's no shame in it, Mal, if you want to pull out of this job. I don't. No shame in it, not in your situation, not these days. It won't happen again. In your next life, find yourself a woman who likes stopping at home baking Eccles cakes. Yeah, when they start making them like that, I will. Who's playing the bloke in a burka? Hello? Hello? Can we have a name? Is he a volunteer? Did we nick him? Dug him out first thing. Going to charge him with the copper thefts later on today. What about Ross? Managed to get your son's dear little friend into care without losing the use of my other leg. He's fallen in with a bad crowd there, sir... if you don't mind me saying. WOMAN: Ross? Ross! WHISTLE BLOWS DC Laurie Franklin. Can I ask you a couple of routine questions? Do you travel on this service regularly? Excuse me. You and your mother were the only ones who got on at that station, though, weren't they? I'll just be a moment. Can I have a quick word with you? We're just finding witnesses who haven't already come forward, just jogging memories. Look, Gerard, it's procedure. It's what we do on the anniversary. Of a week, it's not a year anniversary, it's what we call it. Hmm. Desperate is what I call it. Hi. DC Franklin. You were on this train last week? Beasts are getting restless. They'll have to wait for the train like the rest of us. Get everyone back behind that tape, please, until we're ready! Right behind! Do you travel on this service regularly? Train takes me to college, innit. Day release, for my NVQ. So I'm always on this train. Do you remember the incident last week? I remember panicking about being late for college. I never saw nothing in the papers about it, and then, to be fair, I never read the papers. Nothing in them, is there? Laurie. Excuse me. Here we go. Feeding time at the zoo. Bit nowt nor blooming summat, that were. Not if it jogs someone's memory. Got any more questions for me, then? No, you're all right, love, thanks. All right - that's it, everybody. Thanks very much. So, see you tonight, then. My turn to cook. Oh, great. Bye! Thanks. Got you out of the office, anyway. You just learn to deal with it. Sometimes you only need a tiny thing, though, just one little detail. Hey, isn't that...? What?! She were on the train last week. Hey! Wait! Sorry. Sorry. Are you OK? Oh, God. Be careful running off like that - you'll break your bloody neck. What's it to you? Leave me alone! Why are you chasing me? Hang on. Why are you running away? Some mad woman came at me on a platform, that's why. Do you have receipts for all these...Kimberley? It's Rowan. Proof of purchase? Is it a regular thing, is it, shoplifting trip on a Thursday? Sometimes we go to the Trafford Centre instead. Where is she today, your friend? I don't see her. Not seen her since she met that bloke on the train. She's always been the same, the minute some bloke turns the corner, she's off - no time for her mates. Oh, and he's "the one" this time, she texted me, but she always says that, so... My mum says that's the end of her clubbing and alcopop days. What? Cos he's a Muslim, obviously. MOBILE BEEPS I checked the file. It said two years ago, Jamal Matthews walked away from a charge of malicious wounding, because all the witnesses all took flight. Gang thing? He's not a player, apparently - just a horrible little bastard who fancies himself. He still does. It's just my bad luck he was the only person on the train who actually saw owt. Thanks for meeting us, Mr Matthews, I expect you remember me from the train last week? What I remember is you behaving in a rude and disrespectful manner to me. OK, thanks for agreeing to see us anyway. And now you want to disrespect the whole community. An English policeman in a jilbab? What's that all about? Are you determined to offend us? As I told you on the phone... And as I told you, I didn't see nothing - it was just a flash. If we're going to have any chance of finding the family of this young Muslim boy... You're not interested in finding anyone's family - you're just trying to sniff around, harassing us, thinking the worst of us, looking for bombs in each and every corner. Yeah. I know about your agenda, And I know about "preventing violent extremism". As I said to you, I've got nothing to say. So can you get out of my way, please? I prefer helpful people. Come on, I'll introduce you to one. I can offer moderately strong support for the proposition that this shoe was worn by this foot. There's the beginning of a Hallux valgus there. That's a bunion to you, my darling. Although I'm sure your mother never let you wear those kind of shoes. This is my colleague, DC Franklin. Charming. This has an overlying fifth and other technical stuff. The shoe's a seven or a seven and a half. Obviously it came off with some force, because the laces are still tied. But that's not my area of expertise. We'll get a knot analysis done. One question for you, though. This dead boy of yours does have two feet? He did, yeah. I seem to have only one poor lonely trainer. When we find the other one, we'll let you have it, all right? So, how's the family? Oops. Have I said the wrong thing? No. Luke's fine. We're fine. All right? Thanks. Luke! Luke! Come out here now! Luke! I know you're in there. Luke! Luke! Come out here now! BABY CRIES Shh. His first name was easy - Michael, suits him. But the responsibility of choosing someone a surname... A family name for someone who hasn't got a family. Is he all right? Yeah, he's just a bit girny today. You did well, Colly, you know? Michael Summers is a great name. Makes him sound like some darling wee hippie. I've been asked more than once when we're going to get him circumcised. Oh, for God's sake. Shush, Nick! It's not going to happen. Not yet, anyway. He's just a little baby, and the one good thing about this whole situation is that he can decide who he wants to be, without any bloody mullahs...or priests or rabbis sticking their... Sorry. Not enough sleep. Can you hold the fort? Your current dad is a total dinosaur! We'll have to get you a better one, won't we? Yes, we will. Nick? Nick! Michael! What happened? He just... ..Ambulance. 'It's exactly a week since a young Muslim asylum seeker...' There she is! LAUGHTER AND WHISTLING 'Today a male police officer dressed like the victim in traditional female clothes...' He'll be doing panto at Christmas. Well, we're going to get every loony and his wife on the phone now, aren't we? PHONE RINGS Major Incident Room, PC Tait speaking. How can I help you? I'm not adopting any tone of voice as far as I'm aware, madam. '..which took a young life on a quiet day in a quiet street. 'Police officers have also been at stations and on trains today asking for help. 'Now they're hoping that today's publicity will encourage someone who knew Farid 'to come forward and fill in some of the missing parts to the puzzle.' 'It's really important that we eliminate people that day. 'This person is vital to our enquiries. 'We don't know why he was wearing women's clothing, but the important 'thing is we don't believe Farid came to the bridge alone. 'The smallest detail can help, and that's what we are appealing for today, really.' 'Police have interviewed the driver of the train, said to be...' No, I can't pass your condolences on to the family, I'm afraid, because we don't know who they are yet. That's the whole point of the appeal. 'Major Incident Room, PC Tait speaking.' (LAUGHING) 'How can I help you? 'Hello?' Hello? Shit! Five minutes and only cos he insisted. First off, I thought it were a brick. I thought, she's come back for me. She's come back for me and she's going to kill me with a brick. I thought I were a goner. I slammed the brakes on immediately. That were after I realised that she weren't going to jump this time. All this is in a split second. The amount of stuff that can go through your head all at the same time. Flowers! Amazing. Flowers. So, you had your third, Pat. See? Nobody died. Yeah. End of, now. Wind the clock back. End of. Did you see her face? Of course not. How could I? It were all too fast. He was fine yesterday. Didn't settle too well overnight, but that's nothing unusual, is it? You expect that of a baby this age. What has happened to him? I've no idea. He was...he... I've no idea. He's not a real Muslim. Danny's as Muslim as I am. And your sister loves him. Loved him since they were little kids. Playing on their little bikes together. You're too young to remember. But that lad converted right and proper and he married my daughter according to the law. And you'll respect that, Khalil, if you respect your father. Visiting time's over. I rang round that many people asking for help with the driving today - everybody made excuses. They're all cowards. Her husband is a hero. Not to me he's not. To me, he's just a murderer. Why you here, then? They're just babies. I hate everything he stands for, but it's not their fault, is it? None of it's their fault. You all right? Come on, in you get. Don't want to get wet. Long drive. Are you all right? Psst! Luke! Go away. Come here now. No, I promised me dad. I'll get my head kicked in. You'll get your head kicked in if you don't. Come on. Luke! Seen Carpenter anywhere? No, I've been keeping out of his way. 'More sort of...green.' 'More sort of...green. 'Sorry.' Boss? Look at this a minute. 'I remember her eyes. 'Really pretty eyes she had. Not dark, 'not really dark. More sort of...green.' So? So, he can't have seen Lola's eyes. That doesn't make sense. The train were going too fast. DI Craig's phone. He's so specific. Two seconds. Mal? He's describing someone he knows. Lola didn't have green eyes, though, did he? Hello. Maybe the other one did. The one that might have pushed him. He didn't see anybody's eyes cos he was going too fast. You said that yourself. I'll send someone down, OK? I want to bring him back in. Can I bring him back in? Sure. There's a sweet white-haired old lady downstairs who won't speak to a policeMAN, apparently. So if you could... Yep. Brilliant(!) Get us a coffee, will you? Hi. Mrs Gladwyn? Are you the police lady? Yeah, I do my best. Only the man on the phone, he were laughing. I thought, "I don't want him laughing at me." Cos they're my neighbours, you see, love. If they're noisy, you're best off going to the council. No, no. They're quiet as mice. OK... I mean, live and let live. That's my motto. Good for you. You see, they both went out together on the day that lad went under the train. It were weird, and I haven't heard a peep out of them since. This is me. And that's them. Now you're standing here, do you remember any names? No, love. It's not neighbourly round here like that, not any more. She did have a smile for you, like. The older one. She did a bit of cleaning up, too. I will say that for her. It was her who put these bits of flowers and whatnot in. Are you going to break in? No, I am not. Maybe they left a key. No, Mrs Gladwyn. Don't, love. What's the point of calling for the police if they won't bash the door down? I'll get in touch with the landlord and come back. Is this their car? Oh, aye. They've only had it a week. DC Franklin. Can you run me a PNC check? Tango, 8-0-8, Alpha, Yankee, Yankee. SIRENS No! What are you doing? Mrs Gladwyn, no. Step back. Back! I mean it. You stay out there. Go on. You wouldn't be in there at all if it weren't for me. You never told me there were a baby. Oh, aye. The girl were pregnant. But aren't they all? BABY SCREAMS Lot of vague autonomic symptoms here. Hyperactive reflexes. This hypotonia is worrying. He's soaking wet again and his respiratory rate is very high. I'm running a score of seven now. Oh, it makes me so angry. 'It's just...' We're on the list now and she's thinking, "Come on, why are we waiting?" It's only been a week. I know. We've got to be patient. I keep telling her that. But it's that baby. The one in paper. Michael. Nusrat can't get him out of her head. I'm not asking for her, Felicity, I know that's not on, but if I could just let her know that there's some hope. < Hello? Anyone in? Nusrat, love. I really want you to try not to get so hung up on any one particular child, OK? I were just asking her. It'll be months before a decision is made about whether anyone can adopt him. There's your lovely dad. How's he keeping? Well, thanks. Who's that with him? Not sure. Son of a friend of his, I think. Well, I'll be off. I'll give you a ring next week. I never came to see you, did I, after the funeral. No, you didn't. I'm sorry. I was angry when I should have been sad. Never got on when we were kids. Sisters, you know. Usual. But then we grew up, and then she got you and all she ever talked about was how bloody wonderful you were. Yeah? Me and her did agree on everything. I should have been there for you and Gemma. Well, you're here now. That's all that matters. He's settling now. Will he be all right? What do you think it is? I can't be 100% sure till we get some results back from the lab. But I'm fairly confident in a diagnosis of NAS. Neonatal abstinence syndrome. The baby is in withdrawal. Most likely from methadone. Have you got owt to eat? Got any money? A bit. And your mobile phone? Why? Cos I'm taxing you, you little grass, why do you think? You can't tax me. I thought we were mates. Think I'm your mate? You grassed my dad! You grassed my dad and I'm going to kill you! Kill you! OK. Two women, one maybe 40, one just a teenager, pregnant. Not known if they were related. Men, various, coming and going. She thinks maybe there were one young fella living here. No names as yet. Just trying to track down the landlord. DI Craig. This is definitely the second trainer, yeah? All right, slow down. Found in the back of the car. It's one job, boss, for definite. Lola and the baby. When was this? The disappearing detective. It's hard for him. It's hard for everyone. You don't bring it to work. Luke! Luke! Luke? DOOR OPENS Luke? A fortnight, that's all I asked for. A fortnight's holiday like any other normal person living a normal life, but it all falls apart. Jane, anything could have happened to him! All you want to do is attack me. He's coming home with me. We've got to find him first. He doesn't want you. He showed up at the swimming pool. Why would you let me think he was lost!? He was filthy, shivering, covered in bruises. You let him run wild. No, you leave him! He doesn't want you. He says his friend hates him now and it's all your fault. Luke! Don't make me say these things in front of him. Will you just stay there? Stay there! There's things I need to say to you and I don't want him hearing. I'm divorcing you, Mal. Yeah, I'm divorcing you and I'm taking my son home with me now. And whatever access your knob of a lawyer tries to get you, I'm going to oppose it. You always let us down. Luke. BABY CRIES Hiya. I was hoping to find Colly Trent. Is she here? What's happened? BABY WAILS He had a bad night, but I just thought it was colic. This...can kick in any time up to three weeks after birth, apparently. It's not your fault, Nick. That's not good enough. Not when there's a child involved. He might have... what they call developmental problems. Christ! I've only had him a week and I love him to bits. It's ridiculous. You on your way home? No, still got a bit more to do. Do you ever get any time off, Laurie? That would be nice. Would you like to go for a drink some time? Oh, sorry, I... I'm just not looking for anyone at the moment, and besides, professionally, you know... It was just a drink. PHONE RINGS Pat, DC Franklin. I hope you're feeling a bit better. I was wondering if we could have another word tomorrow. Maybe you could come in to see us? Give me a call back. Thanks. DOOR OPENS When you see Mal... I won't see him! Why would I see him? Tell him to switch his sodding phone on. God, you share one bloody taxi. PHONE RINGS Paul, can we do this tomorrow, mate? 'There was me complaining I had a boy with two feet, but only the one trainer.' Now I've got two trainers with two feet each. I only really saw it on the second shoe, the one that came in today. It's a wonderfully clear example, actually. I could use it when I'm teaching. Look, mate. It's late, and I don't know what you're talking about. This shoe has been worn by two different people. So, it's second-hand, yeah? Possibly, or just shared. Criminals do seem to share each other's shoes a lot. Odd, that. And one's rather smaller than the other. Like...a man and a woman? I can offer only limited support for that proposition. But when you get that knot analysed, see if they think he tied his own laces or whether somebody else tied them for him. Are you still there, Mal, or am I talking to myself? 'Hello! 'No, no thanks.' It's all part of the service(!) Regular as clockwork this, every night. Never fails. There's not much in life you can rely on like that. That's true enough, Jenny, love. That's true enough. Bit like fishing, sometimes, you know. Sit for hours and get nothing. Always rely on this, though. And here it comes. The Manchester bin line. Three trains a day to a landfill site in Scunthorpe. All these containers every day. Every night - and that's just one city. Oh, look. That's special, that is. That's just for you, that is. That's a Class 66, better than the 60. I knew there'd be numbers involved somewhere. You see them doing that, don't you, at the station. The trainspotters. Writing numbers down in those... What are they called? What are those things? Notebooks. Notebooks. Yeah. Women always find that a bit sad. Is that what your wife thought? More fool her. PHONE RINGS DC Franklin. 'It's Pat.' Pat, hi, thanks for getting back to me. 'I can meet you now, if you like. No, it's getting a bit late. So tomorrow would probably be better. 'I'm only round the corner. We could have a drink.' OK. How about 11 in the morning? 'How about right now? I know what you want.' I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks, Pat. Shit! I told you I was just round the corner. I'll buy you a drink. No, we have to do it properly. We need to talk in a proper manner and record a statement and that. We can't do that now. I'm not making a move on you, if that's what you think. Of course not. I will do if you want. Just get a grip, please, Mr Dowling. That's just it, I can't! I can't get a grip and I just can't keep it all in any more. I'm going out. Khalil's just fed up with himself for not having a job and having to crash on our sofa. Whose fault is that? A year tooling about in Pakistan reciting the Qur'an, that's a great way to raise your chances of employment. My dad couldn't get him into the mosque when we were kids. Look, Danny. I'm afraid of him, all right? I'm afraid of my little brother. I really don't think Khalil's a terrorist. I mean, he's useless. Who'd have him? I'm not saying that. He's just a spoilt little brat. I know, it's just that he seems to be so serious. I'm just worried about him - I don't know what is going on inside his head. I did a terrible thing today. When Felicity asked "Who's that," I thought, "Oh, God, he's going to come out with all his Sharia law nonsense - astaghfirullah. "And how adoption's all wrong. They'll take fright and that'll be the end of us adopting our baby." So... I denied him. God forgive me, I denied Khalil was my brother. Dad? Hey, brother. Hey. Soraya. I used to see her quite a lot. Once a week, if I had the overtime. You know, you hear the girls say, "Oh, he's really lovely, all he ever wants to do is talk to me." Well, it weren't like that for us. The sex was like nothing I'd ever had in my life, and I never got tired of her. This were the Asian girl? People think, "Oh, Asian babes," you know, "sweet and submissive." But she'd have argued the hind legs off a pit bull. And she had dark eyes. Not really dark, more sort of green. So, what happened to her? I don't know. One day she never showed up. Six months ago, it were. And that were that. It was like the waters just closed over her head. There's only one thing I'm interested in, Pat. Was Soraya pregnant? She were a bit old for that kind of caper. What? I thought she was a teenager? She were 40-odd. I mean, I've tried some of the younger girls, like, but... Did she do drugs? How would I know? Because we weren't friends, were we? If we'd have been friends, she wouldn't have disappeared on me. Left me hanging. But they never really let you in, the bitches. No matter how much money you give them or how well you treat them, they still never really like you. Do you really think you saw her up on the bridge, Pat? The worst thing is... I think I didn't brake immediately. I can't be sure, and it's doing me head in, but I think I went for her. And she'd have fucking deserved it. You won't believe the conversation I've just had. Mother of all verbals. Totally inadmissible, so it's a good bloody job I'm not investigating a murder, isn't it? Sod off, I'm a police officer. That was me being kerb-crawled. In me mack! Boss? You still there? Talk about all the buses coming at once. That Nick bloke tried to pull me tonight. What's all that about? You OK? What, now? I've never been much good at first times. Well, it's a good job there's always second times to look forward to. There's still a lot to look forward to, Jen, love. We're not dead yet. Would you like to come in? I'd like that very much. Hey. Are you OK? Oh, hiya. So, what's that called? What? That expression on your face. That's my sympathetic face. I can put it away just as fast. Listen... I suppose a fuck's out of the question? Well, you buy me a pint... ..then ask me that again. Do you have any idea what's really happening out there? There's no way they can find out about Khalil. It's still possible there's an innocent explanation. What's your real interest in Farid Sardar? I think this is a terrorist job, and no-one's telling me anything. I heard what she said to you this morning and I'm asking you the same question my daughter did. Terrible thing about your job. Makes you suspicious of everyone. We'll throw everything we can at it until we find whoever was on that bridge with him when he jumped. Or was pushed. Where's Pat this morning? Rang in sick. Never known him do that. Must be at death's door. How come you get to ask questions and I don't? What's your real name? Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling@bbc.co.uk
