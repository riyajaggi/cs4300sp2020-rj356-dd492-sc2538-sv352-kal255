Danny gives Jen and Laurie a lift to the hospital,where Jen fits and is admitted overnight. Here Laurie learns from social worker Colly and foster father Nick that a baby has been abandoned in a toilet and found by cleaner Didi,who swears to protect it and after whose brother Michael the baby is named. As Danny and his Muslim wife Nuss discuss adoption Laurie believes that the baby and the suicide are connected.

I don't mind. Bugger off, minger. I don't want to get in the way.

 I'm not the one with the appointment, am I? Mind that car! There'll be another one along in a minute. Another what, Mum? I know what you need, Laurie. A nice cup of coffee. I need more than 24 hours in a day. You can't park that car here, miss. And you can't ride that bike here, mister, so that makes us both villains. They have bastard clampers, don't they?  I'll clamp you if you don't watch it, potty mouth. Silly old cow. See, I blame the parents. So do I. WHOOPING Where are you going, Ross? Apple, penny, table. Apple, penny, table. OK. Now world backwards.

No, Mum, how many more times? You have to make it bigger. Stop going on at me. I'm not, I'm just saying... God, is this train ever going to leave? It's the new timetable. They've made a right mess of it. I were stuck for two hours last week cos of  blooming thieves stripping out the copper wire. Mum. It runs alongside the track. Ten to two. My daughter's been living down south. Poor lass! Where are you from? Wrong side of t'Pennines, me.  Can't you tell? Mum, concentrate, please., Just show ten to two. It's always ten to two... God.

Pat, just pick it up, for God's sake. PHONE BEEPS BABY CRIES Tu es tomb? du ciel, quoi? Mais o? es ta maman? Mais ou est ta maman? Tu l'as perdue, mon petit? Tu l'a cachee quelque part? Where is your maman? How am I supposed to know? Does she have to shout? I'm talking to my Mum! Mate can you open the doors? Excuse me! Excuse me! Of course he can't open the doors. There are trains out there! There is a station just round the corner. I could walk it from here. Catch a bus. I'll come with you. In those shoes? Keep your nose out. Stop bossing me about. Shh. Free teas coming. Run up and down, do a free issue, all right? What's going on? There's some tea back there. It's me, Danny. Let me in, mate. Let me in. I thought someone had managed to lock themselves in bloody loo again. I looked out of the window, but the warning light  weren't on so that weren't it  and that's when I saw 'em. Bloody kids. She looked straight at me. She had her arms out like this. Like this. It's all right, mate. I can't move. I'll do it. Hello? Hello? Control? Can you hear me? Yeah. I'm the conductor on 101275 and we've struck a member of the public. She chose me. She chose me. How long we going to be stuck here?  How am I supposed to know who? I reckon I can get compensation though,  I've got right bad whiplash in my neck. The rules say they've got 90 minutes to  get the train rolling again. Ninety minutes! I've got a job interview. I said free issue, you tosspot. GIRL TALKS ON PHONE I'd expect to see that signal on red by now. They've an emergency button in the driver's cab. I'm very sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Still not sure what's happened here. I don't think we'll be moving for a while yet. Oh, man. Can I just ask if we've got any "competent  person" here? Oh, my God. I just mean, someone who works for the railway? Yeah, I'm a police officer. Oh, it's her day off! Oh, honestly. We've had a person under our train. Right. What do you want me to do? Can you just give us a minute? GIRL: Where do you want me to put it? It's me. I'm sorry, I'm not going to make it. Oh, God, can you hear me? I'm really, really sorry, Nuss, something has  come up at work I can't get away...  Nuss, Nuss are you there? I'll get there as soon as I can. All right? BUZZER SOUNDS Yes, Pat. Ambulance, need to ring the ambulance... Control will sort it all out. It's so dark. It's so cold. Don't worry, mate. What is going on? Back in a minute. You're not going on the track? Signal's on red, it's quite safe. Yes, I know that, but... He's scared she's still alive out there. Laurie. Danny. You know you're going to get a jumper one day.  You train for it, but... I'll go and sit with him. No, you can't. Member of the public, you're not allowed in the cab... Yeah, OK. sorry. You put that old trainspotter in charge of keeping my mum happy. Danny... there's no need to go closer than you have to. Where do you think you're going? See? One law for him and another one  for the rest of us. KNOCK ON DOOR Danny sent me. I'm a police officer. Yeah, smoking kills. Here you are. I don't want to talk about it, all right. All right. Just don't tell my mother you caught me smoking. Supposed to be my day off. Yeah, mine too. Your first time? Yeah. KNOCKING ON DOOR Hello! Hello! Nobody's telling us anything out here! I miss this job because your train's late and  I'm going to sue. You want to tell him in there to get on to  his governors and get this train moving. You want to tell him in there to open the bloody doors. I don't want to do any of those things so please, you go and sit down, sir. There's people on here getting in a right panic. That old lady down there, she's claustrophobic. That old lady is my mother and she's  nothing of the sort. So go and sit down and stop winding the other passengers up. That's assault, that is. I want your number? Go on, give me your number. Sure, it's DC Laurie Franklin 100893. Complaints phone number is 0845 935276.  So you be my guest. -You all right? -Yeah, are you? I wish we could get off this train. The older you get, the less time you have left, the more of it you spend hanging around waiting for God knows what. Draw some more of your clocks. helps pass the time. What's up with your mate? I dunno - she's in a right mood. See that lad down there? What about him? Do you think he's a terrorist? Shhhh! I don't suppose the thought of you ever  crossed her mind, Pat. She just saw a train. Thought... escape. I was three miles out of Castlebury and had  just passed the signal on green... Pat, save this. British Transport Police will  be here soon. They're always bloody hours. I know, but you don't want to go through  all this twice. I was three miles out of Castlebury and had just passed the signal on green. I was taking power when I saw her looking down at me. She was stood on the bridge and then she looked into my cabin. All of a sudden she was jumped up on the bridge and on her way down. Arms out like this, like wings flapping. And her eyes were wide open. She fell right into the path of my train. Go on, get away! I thought, she's going to come right into the cab, she's going to smash right through the glass and land right on me... She were a looker, too, under all that bloody black sheeting they wear. BABY CRIES Maternity unit are checking now if any of their mothers and babies have parted company. Meantime... We've acquired a baby down here who has lost his mother, can you...? Thanks, yeah. Not that way. You hurt him. They are nurses. They do know what they're doing. When I was a few days old, my mother left me  outside the baker's shop. Half an hour before she realized. The lady who abandoned this baby did not make a mistake. She made sure to leave him somewhere he would be found by kind people. She did a terrible thing. For who will be his mother now? That'll be social services. Or to put it another way, me. Oh, don't look so worried! I'll get him a proper foster mother who  knows which end is up. What's your name, flower? Dieudonn? Mputu. The police are here. Babies, babies, everywhere. Why is she laughing at me? Well, Doody or whatever your name is... Dieudonne Mputu. You can call me Didi. OK, Didi. With abandoned babies, sometimes they  like to name him after the person who found him. And your name... well. Bit of a mouthful. My brother is called Michael. Michael. Nice. Didi has a brother called Michael. Hello, Michael. SIREN SOUNDS Oh, It's awfully hot in here. Do you think has he got a bottle of water on that trolley? I don't know. All I can see is two cans of lager. I really think I need to get out of this train. SHE VOMITS Right, that's it. I'm getting off this train. What you going to do, storm the doors? Cool! Sit down. Are you all right? He's coming back. Yes. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, no! What do you think you're doing? What does it bloody hell does it look like?  Unlawful imprisonment, this is. I'm coming with you! What happened to you? Pushed me out of bloody carriage. Come on! Mum? Mum, I'm going to have to get off  the train. It's like Armageddon out there. Well, don't be long. Come on, we'll get you off the train an'all. You follow me. Stop guys just stay on the train. It's for your own safety. Do you realise how many forms I'm going to have to fill in... I'm a police officer. Filling in forms is what I do. You lot stop now. Come back. OK jump, I'll catch you. You will not! I don't mind if he catches me. You're staying back on that train! You came out to go walking, didn't you? Go on! Go on. Mum, please. Mum get back on the train. Get those people back on the train! It seems they've all got better places to go, sarge. I'd rather be in Lanzarote myself but some of us have got a job to do. Since it's clearly a suicide... I don't think that's for you to judge, is it? Sorry, DC Laura Franklin. The driver says she threw herself off that bridge with her arms open. Those two lads I saw on the track must have seen summat. Good. OK, Miss Franklin, I should say that's  quite enough of you for now, so why don't you get your tanks off my lawn and think about what you'll say to your gaffer when you get a tug tomorrow for unauthorized evacuation of a train. Shove this numpty and her mates in a corner  and glower the buggery out of the lot of them. Right, where is my driver? Just railway bill. BABY CRIES If I get off now, I can get an appeal out by dinnertime... Asking her to come forward... She may be in need of medical attention. OK. Using our powers under the Children Act, yeah. Catch you later. ..Great, I'll try her first then. Fostering service have given me some numbers. Everyone on the ward does know, don't they, he is not to be released? Whoever turns up, even if she claims to be the mother, he's in our care and he's not going anywhere? It'll be like Fort Knox in here. It was just good luck for me. I turned my machine off, and I heard a little cry, and I pushed the door, and there he was. Colly! Can my friends go to see Michael? You can ask, but I don't think they're going to want tourists. I wonder what his real name is. His real name is Michael. After my brother. No, of course I understand. No worries. No. You are clearly in no position to take him. Hope you feel better soon. OK. Hi, it's Colly Trent. Listen, love, I've got an emergency come in just this morning, and the fostering services... Oh, no! I didn't know - sorry... nothing serious, I hope? Yeah, good luck now, OK. I'll have one of these as well. 0-3 months, thanks. Go on then. PHONE RINGS Nick? Colette. Long time since I heard your voice. You must be desperate. I've an abandoned baby and I have heard that you're still approved. Are you able to take him? Nick? I'm in Scarborough with Gemma. His name's Michael. 888 There are no medical concerns. I must be mad. Thanks, Nick. At least we're moving. We might still get there in time. You OK? Hold on to this. If we get our skates on we might make it before the clinic shuts. Excuse me! Is there any chance, my mum's got a hospital appointment. Sorry love I'm in a hurry. Mum's got an appointment, is there any chance we could jump the queue? Never mind, come on mum. What are we doing? We are going to have to get a bus. Danny! Danny! Danny! Do you know her? Are you going anywhere near Queen Mary's hospital? It's really kind of you. It's on our way, pretty much. It's just, if you're in a hurry... It's fine, really. You've got no chance anyway, now. Very nice having your own personal taxi driver. Except for the earache. Never stops talking, this one. Just sociable. Might as well be friendly as not, in't it? Where are you from then? Oh, sorry, she asks everybody that. No problem. I'm from Skipton. Her appointment was supposed to be 12 o'clock so... In a rush, yeah?! Look at this traffic - mad, in't it? Where they all going, all these people? We were on the train before. Train's rubbish. Taxi's better! Careful! A girl went under our train. Killed herself. On purpose. That's right, love. That's why Danny boy called us out. She was one of your girls. Mum... An Asian girl? You never said. You might know her. Mum, just cos she were Asian... No, your mum's right. If she were from round here, I probably do know her. I Know everybody, me. Sad world, in't it, love, sometimes. MOTHER GASPS It's against our religion, you know. Suicide? You could have fooled me. See the respect my son-in-law shows me. Everybody doing wishful thinking, in't it? We've got lads thinking all you got to do is grow a long beard and tie a bloody scarf round your bloody head and that makes you a Muslim. And we've got politicians thinking all they got to do is shout louder. You've set him off on one now! And what do you think? I think you can't just do what you like with the body God gave you. Are we nearly there? Are you going to be sick? No, I'm all right! Don't fuss. Mum, hang on. How much is that? Mum, will you wait! Don't even think about it. No, you have to let me pay. I'll be charging him to the train company anyway.  Give us your card, I might get you later. Want a free ride back and all? Thank you. Thanks. Something about seeing her like that. A Muslim girl, dead like that. Summat... Something a bit close to home. Just for one minute. Come on, get in. What's going on? Police. You are naughty! Oops! You could kill someone! Sorry! I'll give you sorry! What about this mess! Words! Apple penny table! Slow down! Oh, no. They've gone. No chance. They're facing the full might of the law! Hi. Can I help you? Mrs Mason. Jennifer Mason. She's come for the memory clinic. I know we're really late, but if you had any idea what journey we've just had. Oh, clinic's been cancelled. All the appointments rescheduled. We did write to you. I've come a really long way and I need my mother to see a doctor. As I say, we did write to you... You deal with these patients all the time and I imagine you have a good idea how well  they deal with random envelopes. Apple penny table. Have you been rehearsing her? I practise all the time, don't I? I want to get it right. If you don't want us to cheat, you could try  changing the bloody questions once in a while. It's not her fault, is it, if she has to keep on passing the same test to prove she's even worth bloody treating. You want me to beg? Have you got a mother, nurse? MOTHER GROANS Even on a normal day, I'd say turning  up hours late is grounds for divorce. On a day when we were supposed to be playing happy  families for our social worker... Was she angry? No, she was cool. She said they give you the questions in advance. How far in advance? Just like 15 minutes or whatever. Just while you're sitting outside waiting to go in. Are those for me or one of your other wives? For you. We're going to walk it. So, what sort of day you had, Tommy the Tank? Nothing special. You're about three weeks late... Two! And I got flowers. Come on. Come here. His mother will have had all on, concealing her pregnancy. We don't know that she concealed it. No, but usually... Listen to me, what's with the "usually".  I've never had one of these before! She'll come back for him, surely. I'm kind of hoping she doesn't! I'm all right, really I am, and I'd like to go home now if it's all the same to you. We'll just have a little look at you first,  if we may. Is that OK? Apple, penny, table... No need for that now, Mum. I just want to look at your eyes, Mrs Mason. This medication your mother has been taking... Maybe it was wrong to coach her, but if you had  seen the way she was before, the confusion, and tears... Perhaps nobody went through the reported  side-effects with you? Dizziness? Nausea? And fits, yes, I'm afraid so.  Only in a minority of patients, but... She can't be in the car more than ten minutes without feeling sick. That's why we had to get the stupid train. Will she have to come off this? Cos it's given her back to me, you know. Given her back to herself. We need to take a good look at her. I'd like to keep her in, find her a bed. Square one. Square bloody one. Give us a pint of best, please love. Could you do us a whisky chaser with that as well, please, love? It's supposed to be my day off. Another day, another dollar, another bloody jumper making a mess of my railway. Is that it then? Yeah, that's it. You can buy me a pint. I've never quite got my head round it, sarge. Well, you buy me a pint and I buy you one back then we're all square. No, I've never got my head round why, when someone kills themself, we automatically classify it as non-suspicious. She jumped in front of a train, Paul. The driver saw her do it. We're not even talking "cry for help" here, are we? She got what she wanted, and what I want is a pint. Is there no sign of that bed yet? I'm sorry. We're all counting the days till  they open the new wing. My mum will be on this trolley all night, won't she? Haven't got any change, have you? I must have spent about 20 quid in this filth today. COINS SCATTER God, it's been a bloody long day. Tell me about it. Thanks. No... there's not enough here for either of us. Sorry. Are you all right? I look after my mum. It's just so tiring, you know? Well, it's hard work being a carer. No, it's not full time. I... She's independent enough, physically. It's me. It's me. I'm just not very good at it. SHE SIGHS It was supposed to be temporary. I moved up here to look after her until she got herself on her feet. I live in London... I'm so sorry. I'm ranting at you. Don't worry about it. Are you here with somebody? Yeah. A little baby. I'm so sorry. Oh, no, wrong idea, I'm going to be fostering him. What's wrong with him? Nothing. Social services always want you to get in as  soon as possible so they have someone to bond with. No, there's nothing wrong apart from his mother abandoned him. Where? Left him in the disabled loo in here this morning. No name, nothing to identify him. You think, the lengths that some  people go to have children. He's not...? He's not Asian, is he, your baby? He's not been circumcised, so... Too young. Seven days is more normal. That's assuming he comes from a Muslim family. Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree. Now I'm looking at him, he does look pretty white. It's honestly quite hard to tell when they're so small. And he is a bit jaundiced, making skin colour even harder to interpret. You'll have to knock this idea on the head.  I've named him Michael, which is so not a Muslim name. Oh, come on, we don't even know if he's brown yet, never mind Muslim. Since when were all Muslims brown, as you so charmingly put it? I think Michael's a lovely name. The Archangel Michael is mentioned in the Holy Qu'ran, actually. HE RECITES A PRAYER IN ARABIC PRAYER CONTINUES In our tradition, Michael lives in the seventh heaven and has wings of emerald green. See, Colly, at least you got the green bit right. Michael is the angel of blessings. Tell that to his mother. This is Detective Constable Franklin. Colly Trent is the social worker. So is that his mother in the fridge downstairs? No idea, I'm afraid. And no way of finding out till after the weekend. You mean, I've dragged myself down here for nothing? Suicide's not a crime, is it? So the girl in the morgue's not urgent.  She's not even interesting. She'll be waiting her turn for a pathologist with all the other boring dead people. Up herself, or what? Wait! I was thinking... if there is any chance of a link between my baby and their body, maybe I should call the Transport Police back out? Rather you than me, love! Where is she? Where's my Mum? You're supposed to be looking after her! Oh, There you are! I've been looking for you to tell you. They found this little baby in the toilet. Really? Good Lord. Oh, I'll be glad to get home. No, they're looking for a bed for you. What? Remember? Oh, yes... How could I have forgotten that? I'm losing my marbles, aren't I? Your marbles were all present and correct last time I looked. There's no need to stop here with me, Laurie. I've got more pride than to turn my toes up in this horrible place. Don't even think about it, not unless your bra and pants match. It's supposed to be me looking after you! I can't remember now when it turned the other way round. There's a lot I can't remember. Well, it's all going to be all right. No, it's not. But we'll have some fun while we can, eh? Go home. You need your sleep. I'll just sit here with you for a while. You don't have to. I want to. There's me thinking it might upset her, but no, her eyes light up and she's off texting her mates for the gossip. You worry about her too much. Ibra, she's still not right. Well... DOOR OPENS All right, love. Hey, Dad. ..Hello. So what's the gossip, then? OK, so the party line is your dead girl can't be a Muslim, or if she is, she can't have killed herself on account of it being a sin. Actually, Amira thinks it's some sort of runaway bride thing, Shaista thinks Amira's been reading too many detective stories, and Rukhsana says... "If that dead girl's mother-in-law is like mine,  I don't blame her for jumping in front of a train!" Somebody knows her. She won't be local. No Asian girl could go missing from round  here without you'd know about it already. I'm telling you, somebody round here knows what's going off. WHISTLE BLOWS Bring your arm further round, bring it round, yes, you. MOBILE PHONE RINGS Hello? Mal. Mal! Lane two! Good effort, right, now, we're going to do  a set of ten 100s on 140. Go off the red top. OK. Things some people do to get out of training. Hello. Lower. What? Smile, me old love, this bit's fun. All right, it was unusual, you don't see too many jumpers wearing burkas, but unusual's not enough to justify suspicious, is it? So you balleds up, but we're on it now. Look, this is us on it. And then Natalie Cryer rings up about this bloody baby... Don, stop your worrying, eh? Easy for you to say. You didn't classify the death as non-suspicious. BABY CRIES Who the hell are you? I am Didi. Well, er, I don't think you're supposed  to be in here. There's supposed to be security. They said I can come and check up on  him whenever I like. I'm Didi. They must have told you about me. No. I found him. I saved him. He is named Michael after my brother. Are you a policeman? No, no. I'm his foster father. Where is your wife? Nobody here but us chickens, pal. But your wife is his foster mother? There's no wife, there's no mother, only me. But that's not natural. Where are you from, what did you say your name was? I am Dieudonn? Mputu. In my country, no mother ever abandoned a child. In my country, when there are children without mothers, it is because the mothers are dead in the war. If your country is so bloody marvellous,  why don't you just sod off back there? Since I came to England, nothing good has  happened to me except for this child. He was given to me and I will always watch over him. I warn you. Always. Dr Haydar? This is DI Craig. Sergeant Parker. One here described as half Turkish. Muslim? Doesn't say. They're looking for a one or two parent  adoptive family of similar mixed ethnicity, the usual, yadda yadda, "able to broadly reflect her ethnic origins." She's six years old, though. What about him? Six months old. He's got a lovely smile. Irish mother, Ghanaian father. Look, those two little sisters. They're Asian. Bangladeshi. Not going to give them to a Pakistani, are they? It's mad, this. I don't care if they're pink, blue or mustard coloured. All these kids needing parents. Don't come out with any of that nonsense tomorrow now, will you? I love you. Did I ever tell you that? Ten times a day for ten years. Boring! Oh, I bet I don't sleep a wink tonight. This cleaning log more or less rules out a link anyway, doesn't it? Yeah. Anyway, it makes no difference... To you deciding to reclassify it as a suspicious death? Safe side, yeah. I'll phone up the Home Office pathologist first  thing in the morning. In the meantime... Why did his mother leave him in the disabled  toilet? As opposed to? The ladies? Or the gents? Nobody would leave a baby in the gents.  Not even a caveman would. DC Franklin. And you are? This is my boss, DI Craig. What? You think they left the baby in the toilet and went all that way and jumped under your train? It's a hypothesis. The victim was hit by your train at 10:09. Do you know what time the baby  was found by the cleaner? 10:09? More or less. The toilets are cleaned every 20 minutes... No, that's right, if she'd left him here  herself, she'd have left him in the ladies, right. Even a friend or a sister helping would've done that.  A man wouldn't risk being caught in the ladies. No, listen... If Michael was abandoned by his father, that could still be his mother under our train. It wasn't his mother. You don't know that. The body under the train wasn't anybody's mother. It was a man. The driver was deceived by the clothes. Your train hit a man. Where are you? Looking for business? No, love, no. You're not who I'm looking for. Leave me alone. Where is she, eh? Looking for some business, darling? Will you just leave me alone?! You're not her! Where is she, eh? Where is she?! Show us again. There's no point. Go on. You keep saying you can't see owt anyway. I might this time. Behind you, look. Just look there. There's you, right. There's that lady what jumped off. And there, look, it's a person. There's a person on the bridge behind her. Luke, you can't tell no-one about this. We'll get into the worst trouble. No-one, Luke. Promise? What if nobody knows except us? My dad said never to talk to no police, never. Burka boy and buggy baby are two different jobs. One of them's mine and none are yours, so back off. This officer was responsible for a potential compromise to... Breach whose human rights? Run! Agh! The person who was killed wasn't a woman. You what? It was a young lad. Thank God. Thank God for that. WOMAN: Imagine someone leaving a beautiful little baby. I really don't think it's a good idea to mention that baby in there. What if we don't ask and someone else gets him? Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail: subtitling@bbc.co.uk
