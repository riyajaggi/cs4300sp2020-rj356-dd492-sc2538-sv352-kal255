 Five Days (2007â€“2010): Season 2, Episode 4 - Day 37 - full transcript 
 Nick takes Michael home and confesses to Colly, his dead wife's sister, that he wants to keep him but Didi tells Colly a child needs a mother and Nuss and Danny are in the frame for the adoption. Khalil freaks out at a royal visit and is briefly taken in by Laurie,which angers Ibra,who confronts his son with the computer photos,to be told they were from the past and that Khalil is changed. Pat meets old flame Maureen who tells him she lived next to the old lady with her friend's daughter Katie - now in Manchester and Michael's mother - and an Afghani boy. But he is not Farid as believed as the real Farid turns up to say he was his brother. Jen and Gerry get close as he goes with her to hospital,where her condition is re-diagnosed as physical degeneration and not Alzheimer's. Laurie and Mal also get close but,as Pat takes Maureen to the police to explain her innocence, Mal is hit by a car whilst pursuing Sohel, one of the train passengers.

 Farid Sardar was an illegal immigrant from Afghanistan. I remember her eyes. He's describing someone he knows. Where is she? Soraya. People think, oh, Asian babes, you know, sweet and submissive. Mrs Gladwyn, No! You never told me there was a baby. I wonder what his real name is. The baby is in withdrawal. Most likely, from methadone. I'm divorcing you, Mal. I'm taking my son home with me now. Would you like to come in? I'd like that very much. See that lad down there? Do you think he's a terrorist? Leave me alone. It doesn't matter what happens to me.

 Hey, brother. Hey. BELL TOLLS AND BABY CRIES HEAVY BREATHING SHE GASPS AND SIGHS What have you got to have nightmares about? I can always think of something. Don't tempt me. BABY CRIES BABY KEEPS CRYING He's not up yet. He had a late night. Whose fault is that? Sitting on that sofa till all hours watching telly. I wasn't hungry anyway. You want to set your alarm clock, Khalil. Make sure it wakes you up in time for your dinner. 14 hours till you're allowed to eat again.

 Allowed! What do you mean, allowed? Ramadan is not a punishment! Yeah, if I get my skates on, I can probably get away for lunchtime. For lunch? Not what I had in mind, no. You're insatiable, woman. CHEERING LAUGHTER Morning. Miss the last bus again, did you? Don't leave your car outside all night, Laurie. Come back and find the wheels taken. You're like a bunch of old women. Not me, I defend you. I tell 'em must have been a one night stand, cos there's no way that he is her type, that's what I say. I've told you, I'm lesbian! DC Lauren Franklin. Yeah, I'm still waiting for that tox report. Where's your number one? Give me a call when you get in? It's urgent. I said, where's your dress uniform? Hanging in my wardrobe at home. Off you pop then. No, boss! Boss! I've got a special reason for asking. I've got a job to do! Farid Sardar is still dead and he seems more of a priority to me. OK, Laurie, I've got a very special reason for telling you. They've not got a single woman in the cordon for this Royal Visit. And how's that going to look in the photographs? Window dressing! I think the Chief Constable would rather call it representing the modern police service. Right So me, HRH, and five fat white blokes? I'm sure he's working on the fat thing. 'DI Craig. Please leave a message.' Will you give me a call when you can. I think our lunch is off. By Royal Command. 'DI Craig. Please leave a message.' Where the hell are you, anyway? TEXT MESSAGE BEEPS Give me a kiss. I don't want my coat. PHONE RINGS I said, where the hell are you? Oh, sorry, it is, yes. Now? Really? Thanks. Have you not gone yet? Toxicology. Luke! Luke! Mum'll kill me if she sees you here! Yeah, I know, yeah. Well? I asked her about this weekend. What did she say? She cried. No, I think that were a good sign. I think you should ring her up, Dad. Ask her out, and that. No, I just want to get to see you. You understand that, don't you? Luke! I'll ask her again, but...you know. Right. Dad's got some friends coming round to have iftar after work tonight. OK, I'll clear up! I told you, you can use the cupboard in the hallway for your stuff. I said I'll do it. The normal dose is two to ten milligrams up to four times a day, which adds up to 30 to 40 milligrams. And according to your report, Farid had what... More than 400 milligrams? Which makes him about ten times more anxious than your everyday suicidal transvestite. Was it enough to kill him? Not under normal circumstances, no. My Mum was on this stuff, years ago. And all her mates. Mother's little helpers. Hello, stranger. Missed us? I have got a proper job, unlike some. So, find any Class A? No, just prescription medicines. Benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Enough to kill him? Not under normal circumstances, no. If there's anything else? Thanks, Prof. OK. This is great! It tells us nothing, does it? I mean, nothing important. Just that he was full of prescription drugs, which he could have got off the street. Yeah. He were on prescription drugs not prescribed to him. Look, Professor Askew proved someone else were wearing his shoes. The knot analysis proved someone else tied his shoelaces. And surely to God, someone else dressed him in a burka. So... Send for someone else! We'll throw everything at this until we find who was on the bridge when he jumped. Or... Or yes, was pushed. Thank you. I know. I'm going! I'm gone! Is she always so enthusiastic? Morning. Cup of tea? Hello, love. Did you forget something? Oh, don't ask. Ooh, I've been longing to get a look at you in your number one. Don't, I've never even had it on. Don't know if it still fits me. That shirt needs ironing. What's it all in aid of? Royal Visit. HRH opening some new children's wing at the hospital. Get you, Lady Muck. I'd better starch it. She went looking for you in the night. I'm old enough to make my own decisions about where I sleep, don't you, Gerard. I agree, but in the night that wasn't too clear to your mother. What are you looking for? Shoe polish. Utility room. What did you mean, it wasn't too clear to her? Half past three this morning, she went into your room to wake you up for school. She'd had a bit of a restless night and says she was just tired. "Can't a body be permitted a little bit of confusion when she's half asleep", says she. It's worse when they're tired. With my wife... Yeah, your wife. I keep asking myself, why on earth would he put himself through this twice? Your wife died of Alzheimer's and you take up with a woman who's going exactly the same way - downhill. Why would you do that, Gerard? Knowing what you know about what it's going to be like? Spit it out, girl. Nice bungalow this, isn't it? My Dad was a bastard but he left her well enough off. Terrible thing about your job. Makes you suspicious of everyone. Yeah. That's right. Makes it impossible for you to see the good in people. Well, I don't envy you. It'll be mayhem, I wouldn't go near that hospital today. You've got that appointment, remember? With the consultant. What appointment? I don't know about that. Well, to be fair, you've not been here, love, have you? It's all right, I'll take her. PHONE RINGS Has something happened? No! No, I just thought, maybe I could help you with the shopping for tonight. It's all done. Do you fancy a walk, or...? You know I'm working today, Khalil. Why don't you go to the library? Or the canal? Or... go and see who the Royal is at the hospital. You can tell me about it later while I'm cooking. Could eat your dinner off that floor! Fit for a Queen. Yes, well, this town ain't big enough for me and Royalty, so I'm running away to the seaside. Are you going to see Michael? I am. Can you ask the foster man to bring him back to see us? Look, Didi, Michael is going to be adopted soon. He's going to have a whole new life, new home, new parents. Will he have a mother? Hello? Is anybody here? So we're going to let go together? Yes? OK. On a count of three. One. Two. Three! Hello, Mummy. Hello, Mummy. He's a mucky pup. Can you go and get Daddy some wipes, darling? OK. Oh, Gemma, not so fast, love. I kept her off school. I needed the company, and I wasn't expecting you. You know what's weird? Every year, the same anniversary. Every year the same day, obviously. But for a couple of weeks beforehand, I always get really down in the dumps and I think, oh, "What's the matter with me?" And then I wake up on the the 4th of September and think, "Oh, right, "my sister died." Silly cow. Me, not her. Five years ago. God. Well, maybe you could come next year and we could make it a family tradition. Are you OK, Nick? In the end, you get used to it. You might meet someone... I meet so many women in my line of work! You meet loads of women! Yeah, OK, sorry, you're not looking for a mother. Nice and gentle, OK? OK. That's it. Ready for your close up, Master Summers? They think they've found him a family. Gets it over with. It's a Muslim couple. Really nice, apparently. Sleeping all day to avoid the fast, and then scoffing yourself silly at night. That's not what Ramadan is about, is it? I'm not sure he does eat at night. He never leaves the sitting room. That'll be the one we used to be able to sit in. Do you think maybe he's depressed? I tell you what, he depresses me. We can't have him still messing the place up when we bring our baby home, Nus. Inshallah! Inshallah, yes, but that social worker's got stars in her eyes when she looks at you. No, you! We can have that baby, Nuss. You know they think we're right for him. But... There's no way they can find out about Khalil. Who's going to tell them? You saw the photographs... It's still possible there's some innocent explanation. If you believed that, you would let me front him out and ask him what he was doing in Pakistan waving a gun around. I'm going to prayers. I can't talk to you when you're like this. If prayer alone could fix everything, we wouldn't have the world we're in, would we. Wouldn't be stood here surrounded by policemen and cameras and people looking at us sideways. I couldn't wait to get back to this country, but it's doing my head in. Mate. You've been going through a lot of changes, and that's hard. Some days, you know, I can't get off the sofa, and I get worked up, you know, for no reason... Go back to the doctors. He'll give you happy pills, sure, but you don't need to take them for long. Just give yourself a chance to get over this depression. What are you doing later? Want to open your fast at our house? My sister's making puris. Cool! Surprise! What you doing, Kimberley? Don't jump out on me like some psycho! Don't turn your phone off then! What you got planned for me today? You can watch me eat my dinner if you like! That's not funny! See you later. See you later, yeah? Puris! Yes! What? No! My boss told me it was all men! So did mine! Bastard! This way, ladies. Thank you, Sir. It's the standing around I can't be doing with. Does my back in. Does my head in! Will you stop pushing me? What is your problem? We've been here hours. Do you think he's on something? Move! Move! All right. You're on my foot! Get out of my way! Stand back, give us some air. Go! One on top of the other. All right calm down. Move it on! I can't breathe, I can't breathe! Listen we'll get you out of here. Just tell me your name. Calm down. Natalie, bring the car round. Bend your knees and up you get. I can't breathe, I can't breathe! Everybody standing there waving and grinning like these celebrities are so important, and you just think, do you watch the news, you people? Do you have any idea what's really happening out there? It looked a lot like a panic attack to me. I couldn't breathe, there was a pounding in my head. Everyone crowding in on me. I can't cope in crowds. I always think everyone's looking at me. Everything's falling apart. I've got some water, do you want some? No! It's Ramadan. Can we go another way, please. This is right close to where I live. Please, I don't want my family seeing me in a police car. Natalie, stop the car. Why? Just do it. OK, Khalil. Listen to me, this is important. You are not well, I can see that. I'm de-arresting you, OK? But if you're going back there to cause another breach of the peace... I won't. I'm sorry. You go home and you stay home. Talk to your family. Thank you. What are you on? Look at him, he's ill. He's harmless. Where's Pat this morning? Rang in sick. Never known him do that. What's up with him? He'd have to be at death's door. So, how's the terrorist mastermind? If you're talking about Khalil Akram, as you clearly already know, I de-arrested him and sent him home. Bold move. Hope you don't live to regret it. No. I got his address. If Special Branch need him, they won't have to tax their one and a half brain cells to find him. They've already been on the phone. For God's sake. PHONE RINGS That'll be them now. Major Incident Room, DC Laurie Franklin. Hey. Hey! OK. Boss! So why the interest in Laurie's arrest today? I'm an intel officer, I'm interested in preventing violent extremism. I was told you were seconded here from Leeds. But who do you really work for? Anti Terror? MI5? What's your real interest in Farid Sardar? I'm sorry, boss, I know it's frustrating. But I've never found a single piece of intelligence on this job I could classify better than D three four. Yeah, well I don't believe you. Your boss needs to talk to my boss. Or to put it another way, you're out of order. Sir. There is no way Cunliffe is just an intel officer. I asked him to put in an intelligence collection requirement. He told me he found nothing. And? There's always something, isn't there? I think this is a terrorist job and no-one is telling me anything. I think he probably sanitized it before it got to me. If there was any background hum around your case, they'd have cancelled this Royal Visit. I can get that up. Yeah. Yep. Thanks. No-one knew anything of her until she was arrested last week, drunk and disorderly in Newcastle. Laurie took a call from Fingerprints Bureau. Newcastle put her prints in the system, the bureau ran them, all routine, and there it was. A match. Katie Marshall. She's 16. Homeless. Was on a methadone programme. And her fingerprints were on the baby's buggy. I think we've found a mother for Michael. Katie Marshall. Teenage junkie, leaves a baby in a disabled toilet... Buggers off to Newcastle. Hopeless, man. Shame your lot didn't get any names. What is your problem? All right. Look, I want this girl. I want to find someone who knows her. What, family? Yeah. Who's that? Farid's mother? I thought she was in Kandahar. She might as well be! No, this was Farid's landlady, according to the next door neighbour. From the shopkeeper's description, she may also be the one we're looking for. The one who was on the bridge with him. Now I'm thinking, with no evidence at all, that she may be the mother of the pregnant girl. Since she's disappeared into thin air, we are currently unable to ask her. Your landlady looks a bit like my auntie. I'll give you her name if you want. Pat! Hey! Pat! HE BREATHES HEAVILY Well, if you've nowt to say to me, just try, "Hello, Soraya." I'm sorry, I'm, er... Soraya, you look so beautiful. I look like shite in daylight. I looked everywhere. I were frantic. I just, you know... I need me dinner. Very nice. These curtains will have to go. Wasn't there something about dinner? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, go on then. Come on, Michael! Flash those gummy gums! This'd be a lot easier if we waited till he can sit up. No, honey, you can't be in this one. Aww! It's a special film, lovey, to show Michael's new parents what a wee smasher he is. Why don't you come and sit beside me? Come on, Gemma. Pull the finger out, Colly, cos you know what they say about children and animals. Big smile! Come on, show us what you've got. Hey? Hey? I keep waiting for the right moment to say this, but there isn't a right time, there's never... a right time to say the really big things. I want to keep him. And I know I don't stand a chance without you supporting my application. So, will you help me adopt him? I think the Adoption Service are pretty confident they've found the right couple. That might change. I'm sorry. Come on, happy, happy, happy. It's all right, Mum. If ever I end up looking like her... I'll kill myself. SHE LAUGHS Mrs Mason? Gotcha! Please come this way. So it's not Alzheimer's then? Oh, well, that's good! Vascular dementia is a type of dementia caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain. We'll need to keep a very close eye on your blood pressure and your cholesterol from now on. So, no more cream cakes. What, so I still go doo-lally, and I still die? What am I going to tell... tell my daughter? I took myself off to hospital, that's all. What were it - an accident? Not that kind of hospital. I've had a lot of sadness in my life. Sometimes it gets the better of me. I came back, though, didn't I? I thought you were dead. Aw, love! I've got nine lives, me. You should have left me word. Why didn't you leave me word? Back off, love, all right? What?! Are we expecting royalty? How come you get to ask questions and I don't? All right. Where did we first meet? Under the arches at the train station. Um... How do I like my coffee? White, one sugar. Ooh! What's your real name? They got me in a couple of weeks since, and showed me this. They're investigating a murder. Oh, God. What did they want to know? It's all right. They wanted to know if I knew you. I said no. You must know now you can trust me. You wrote to me. You came here, to me. It's Maureen, me name, Maureen. Maureen? I quite like it. It suits you. God, it's a good name for a cleaner. You're not really Asian at all, are you? No. THEY LAUGH Not me you came back for, were it? No. Katie. My Katie. She's a wild one, I tell you. God-awful crowd she were running with. Older men, you know, drugs, hard drugs. Her boyfriend, he helped her to see she needed a mother, needed a family about her. That's what life's all about, in't it? Was that why you disappeared from the streets? Cos of your daughter's problems? I won't lie to you, Pat, I carried on like before. Still had bills to pay, didn't I? I carried on working till she came home pregnant. Fancy you being a grandmother, eh? Yeah, fancy. It was supposed to be like a new start. A new start for both of us. Me and Katie, together. I'm happy to go and bang on some doors for you, and ask if anyone's seen her, if that's what you want. Be no harm to ask. Jesus! Police! Drive, just drive! What? Is she dead then, this Katie? No, I hope not, no! Me too. I don't want you digging up my garden. Don't you worry about that, Mrs G. You do look cracking in that uniform. I really have got to get out of these clothes. I bet he likes it, don't you, lad? I do, yeah, I love it. Ooh, to be your age again! If it wasn't against our force-wide diversity initiative, I'd say you look dead sexy in that. Have you seen these shoes? They're a crime against fashion. Hey, it came back to me! I remembered her name. Maureen. No, love. Her name was Katie. No, the other one. The older one. The one who was always clearing up. I shouldn't have come back. If you haven't done anything wrong... I can't find my pills! What? Just tell me what to do, love. I'll do anything to help, you know that. I want my family back. Hey, hey, come on. We'll find them. We'll find them. Yeah, Maureen Harvey or Harding. Hardman, Hardy. That the best you could do? DI Craig. Who? No ideas about job, or...? No. Except maybe a cleaner. Scarborough? Mrs Gladwyn doesn't think they were mother and daughter. And Katie told Newcastle that her mother were dead. Say that again? Running round like blue-arsed flies all day, we don't know much more than we did yesterday. Yes, we do. Farid Sardar just came back from the dead. So if that's Farid Sardar... Hmm. Who's the dead guy in our fridge? L-O-L-A Lola... Don't say it. Don't even think about it. ..All right? No. What? I can't identify him from here, can I? He's walked and hitched 200 miles. It's Ramadan, so he's had nothing to eat or drink. You're going to have to wait here. This is good news for you, Bilal, surely? Oh yeah? How do you work that out? Well, on the down side, you made the mother of all cock-ups by mis-identifying your own CHIS. Be gentle with me, why not? On the up side, this one's not under age. I'll give you five minutes. Thanks. Hello. Hey, Farid. It's going to be a long night. Yeah, we're going to have to be back over here tomorrow, crack of dawn. Might as well stay here, then. Little bed and breakfast. No, no, no! Laurie! Just calm down. The e-fit. The picture of Lola! Here. Baro Dara Mannam. My brother. My brother! "Mistake anyone could have made", is that your line? On balance, I'd prefer a grovelling and heartfelt apology with a bit of sackcloth and ashes thrown in! To be fair to him, sir... What, they look very alike, and one of them had a run-in with a train? Meanwhile, I've had a tug from on high about you sticking your nose in where it's not bloody wanted! Oh, yeah? Anti terror? Or MI5? I told him, "Enayat, I will go to England, "I will find a new life, and then I will send for you." But my brother, he could not wait. At home, there was so much danger, worse every day. In six months, he followed me. Only...Enayat was changed. The journey... in the lorry, in the dark. He could not speak about it, even to me. He was so scared. Scared of shadows. But also scared of you, Bilal. Do you think he might have been so scared he tried to kill himself? No! He is a Muslim. It is a sin. I know someone killed him. So when did you last see Enayat? He was sleeping, and I went out. The Immigration came. I called my brother, but he didn't answer. So then I called Katie and she didn't answer. Is this Katie? Where is she, Farid? Is she here in Scarborough? I don't know and I don't care about Katie. I want my son. Here you are, love. Ta. She's the image of you. I got her into a methadone programme. What with that and the regular meals, she were really starting to look nice again. Who took the picture? Her boyfriend. Or his little brother. That house were like a bloody waifs and strays home. Were that one of the brothers who went under that train? I don't know, do I? I'm not a killer. Why are you doing this? Because I love you. If you loved me, you'd believe me. Because it were me that killed him. It were me, driving the train. I saw you, up on the bridge. I knew it were you. Soraya, it were the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my life. I thought it were you! I loved you and I thought I'd killed you. Sometimes I wish you had. Don't! Don't say that! How were I to know what he were planning? I saw him jump, Pat. I couldn't get to him in time. I see it still, every time I close my eyes. Soraya, listen to me. We're going to the police. Tell them what you just told me and it'll all be over. You can stop running. And we can get on with the big stuff. We can find your daughter. I love her like a daughter, but... Katie's mother was my mate. And when she died, there was this kid, fifteen going on nine. And I looked at her and I thought, God, that's me before it all went wrong. And she needed me, and that were a first for me, Pat. That was a first, and I'd give anything to feel that way again. Hey, hey. I'm here now, love. I'm here. First thing I'm asking Farid in the morning is how he knew the baby were in Scarborough. Hey, off duty. Now you sound just like my ex-husband. It's the job, isn't it? There's not many of us stay married. He's managed to stay married to his second wife, so far. OK, she's a civilian. I just don't think it's dignified to blame the job for everything. So what's your excuse? My piss-poor taste in men! What's yours? I'm a shit husband. Well, my ex-wife thinks I'm a shit husband, anyway. How ex is ex? Enough. Apart from not being able to see Luke, I don't even think about it any more. It doesn't make me... sad or anything like that. So this isn't just a dirty weekend in Scarborough with a married man? Yeah. I know you said you wanted Chicken Korma, but I always think in these places it's best to go a little off piste. Choose the things you've never heard of. Like as not, that'll be what they eat at home, because what they serve in restaurants is nothing like. I heard what she said to you this morning. I heard what Laurie said to you. And I'm asking you the same question my daughter did. If I was chasing women for their money, Jen, I'd have picked someone with a little bit more than you've got. But your wife died of Alzheimer's. Why would you want to put yourself through the same thing twice? Because I made a right cock-up of it last time, all right? Well, are you going to tell me about it? You can tell me anything. You know I'll have forgotten by tomorrow! Nus. They're coming up. See? I put the curtain up so the men can't see into the kitchen. Thanks, but I'll put my headscarf on just in case. Look, I'm sorry I haven't been much use round here... Salaam aleikum! Wa aleikum salaam wa rahmatullah! Now you must be Jamal? Welcome, brother, welcome. Half an hour till sunset. Khalil? Yeah? Make sure your father doesn't smoke himself silly tonight. I'll take your coat. Yeah, it's over there on the left. Straight through. Straight through. That's right. Good to see you. Help me move this table and get those prayer mats down. DISTANT PRAYER CHANTS PRAYER CHANTS Well, I came home one day and she looked at me and she said, "Oh, I'm glad you're here. That boiler's been making an awful racket." She thought I was from British Gas. You're waiting for it, you're always on the lookout, cos they always say it's the worst thing. "Oh, she don't know me no more." But you know, the day it happened to me, Jenny, I had this strange feeling. And I chased it round and round in my head. And then I realized. It was relief. After 30 years of marriage, I was free. Oh, God, that's going to be me. No, no, it's not. No, I promise. I love you. There, I've said it first. Well, I was working up to it! PHONE RINGS No, don't answer that, I'm in mid-flow here. ANSWER PHONE: This is Jenny Mason, please leave a message and I'll ring you back later. Mum? Look it's only me, I'm calling to check up on you. I'll call you in a bit, OK? Oh, you bastard! No, love, thanks a lot, that's brilliant. Great. All right, well, I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks. OK? Yeah, Jane's said I can have Luke for a sleepover tomorrow. That's great. He wants to come swimming with me in the morning. That'll be that five o'clock in the morning type of morning. Laurie, I'm sorry, I can't tonight, you know? Well, I'm too drunk to drive. So find me a train station, Railway Bill. There'll be other weekends, yeah? Yeah, Paris next time. Sometimes things just go wrong, don't they? Half the time you haven't got the faintest idea why, and you're going, "How did I end up here?" My Mum's not old. I don't think of her as old. I weren't having the best time in London, to be honest. Sometimes things just go right as well, don't they? Yeah. And half the time, you haven't the faintest idea why. Etcetera, etcetera. Sorry about tonight. You know, with Luke coming round and everything, it... No. It's priorities, I understand. It's fine. I'd like you to meet him. We're practically mates, me and him. Meet him properly. Get to know you, you know, with me. Isn't that too soon? No. THEY LAUGH AND COUGH So there we are, right, and my wife's auntie's pulled her best shot and the table's heaving with curry and chapatis, and she's spent a fortune. And he turns to me, Khalil, and he says, "Tomorrow, Dad, can we just go get a burger?" He's what, 12, 13. They've only just opened the first one in Pakistan. And it's in Lahore! 300 miles away on those roads. I'd have told him to get on his bike! The truth is, my Dad was as desperate as me! Was it worth it? Yeah. Yeah, it was! THEY LAUGH Do you ever think about going back? My wife wanted to. But the kids were born here, even I were born here. Take your home with you, man. Wherever you go in the world, make like the snail. Good night, chaps. I right enjoyed that, we should do it more often. I don't know why we don't get together more often. See you, Jamal. You know what surprises me most about becoming a Muslim? What? The amount we all eat during Ramadan. Sshhh! Take care, brother. Nice to see you. Take care. Look after yourself. Yeah, you too. Have a safe journey home, lads. Take care. Safe journey home. Thank you, brother. Any time. You come back any time. Khalil, don't forget what I told you, right? He's got a good head on his shoulders, that new friend of yours. He's very free with his advice. What he wants me to tell you is, I got arrested today. No, don't worry, I got de-arrested straight away. De-arrested? What kind of thing is de-arrested when it's at home? I don't know, do I? That's what they called it. I told him you'd just get angry. So now the authorities are going to find out all about you? Find out what? There's nothing to find out! I've seen the photos on your computer. We've all seen them. You and your mates. Up in the mountains with your beards and your guns. Acting the big men. It was wrong. I was an idiot. I was lost, Dad. You have to believe me, I'm not that person any more. You've done nothing wrong. You've got nothing to hide. Just tell them what you told me. Just tell the police everything, and we can get on with our lives. Look, I believe you. I do. And so will they. We'll sort it. We'll sort everything. Come on. I'm shitting myself. It's all going to be OK, love. I promise you. Come on. Hello, can I have a word with an officer, please? It's about... I'll go get us a cab. Mum? Sorry I didn't call you back. No, we're just on our way home now. Mum, can you hear me? Look where you're doing, you stupid bitch! I beg your pardon? Hang on a minute, Mum. Don't I know you? Sohel, right? You were on the train when that lad went over bridge. Sohel! Sohel! Everyone stand back! Mal! Keep back. Mal! Stop him! Everybody back! Keep back! Move back, move! Mal! Hey! Come here! Hey! I'm a police officer, stop! Come here! Mal! Police!. Mal! CAR SOUNDS HORN AND BRAKES GLASS SMASHES My brother's ruined my life, Danny. Because of him, we won't be adopting anyone. What you doing here, Laurie? Can I come back to work? I just couldn't ever think of the right words. Do you know what you've always needed, is to be the centre of attention. You're jealous, and it isn't pretty. All right, mate, that's enough. It's got nothing to do with you, man. My poor brother. I brought him to live with that woman. I never hurt him. You never saw me hurt him. If you're thinking of leaving me again, don't. Michael is a big boy. Nothing can hurt Michael now. Look. He's not making it up. He wants him. Everybody wants him. Where is Michael? Where is my son? What have you done? Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd Sync: Lalitavatie E-mail subtitling@bbc.co.uk
