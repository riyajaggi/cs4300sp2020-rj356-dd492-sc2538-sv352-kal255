 She's on the roof of city hall right now, unable to choose whether she's going to live or die. As the mayor of Shiniki, I would like to make an official request. I request that Alexander W. Wood, the President of the United States of America, talks to her. It can't be. The United States of America, the host country of the summit, is still deferring its decision regarding its policy towards the suicide law. I want them to use this opportunity to give us their answer in regards to what suicide is. Is this what he was after?

 He wants to draw out the president and make him try to convince someone not to commit suicide in public! We can't ignore him. If we tried to get out of talking to that girl who wants to commit suicide, then it would be as if the United States killed her, regardless of the truth. That's a girl, right? Is that girl Ai Magase? I don't have any conclusive evidence. However, it's highly possible that it is. If she really is Ai Magase, then would it be okay if I talked to her? It would be dangerous. As far as I know, everyone who talks to her ends up being controlled by some sort of power. - However-- - I see.

 I can't even talk to her in the first place. A Japanese interpreter would be talking to her directly... But would anyone do such a dangerous job? I'll-- I'll do it. I'm Samuel Hardy, an investigator from the Special Analysis department in the FBI. I've been working on the Magase case full-time. - I can speak Japanese too. - Hey! I didn't say anything because I was trying to be considerate, but I can't stand listening to your English. Start over from elementary school. Together with your son. And... Are you really sure about this? Yes, sir. Well, then. Let's begin. G7 SUMMIT SIMULTANEOUS INTERPRETATION BOOTH They've won. We couldn't escape. They're using human lives to negotiate. They're nothing but terrorists. Such barbaric acts will not be tolerated. Regardless of the truth, she wants to commit suicide, at least on the surface. I asked the media to refrain from broadcasting it, but it was useless. Itsuki is continuing to broadcast the footage through all methods. We must witness it. We must witness the world the suicide law creates. After this dialog, something about the future will have been decided. You. I thought you hated Alex. Yeah. I do hate him. Because he's an idiot. I can't believe what an idiot he is. But only a true idiot would be able to do something about this situation. Nice to meet you. I'm the President of the United States, Alexander W. Wood. So... Can you tell me your name? If you can't, you can use a pseudonym. My name is Kanae Kuyo. It's my real name. How old are you, Kanae? I'm 19. I see. By the way, why are you considering committing suicide? It's not that I want to commit suicide. But I don't really want to live either. I don't know what to do. Can you tell me about yourself? I never stood out much since I was a kid. I think I was just a normal child. When I was in high school, I went to a concert for a band I liked. I met a guy there. We became friends, and I slept with him. He was in high school. We were the same age. We decided to date. He was my first boyfriend. But after a while, I found out I was pregnant. I couldn't get ahold of him anymore after that. My parents told me to get an abortion. But I decided to give birth to my child. And then, I gave birth to a boy. What's his name? I named him Haru. Haru never gave me much trouble. He would drink a lot of formula. I thought, "I wouldn't mind even if he were a bit harder to handle." I would have stupid thoughts like that. And then? One morning, Haru wasn't moving anymore. They call it sudden infant death syndrome. I was sad. I cried my heart out. I was depressed. But after I went through being sad for a while, it got quiet. Quiet? Yes. It wasn't a strong feeling, like I wanted to die. It just got really quiet. President. What should I do? Do something! Alex! Hey, Kanae. Yes? What a coincidence. We've both been worrying about the same thing. The same thing? About what "good" is. See? You said it just now, right? You said, "What should I do?" Yes. I'm really sorry to tell you what I'm about to say. Actually, I don't know yet. I haven't found the answer. You don't know? Yeah. That's why I can't tell you what's "good" now. So can you wait a bit? Wait? Yeah. I've almost found the answer. So I want you to wait until then. Are you saying it's something I should stay alive to keep thinking about? No. I'm just saying that I want you to wait until I find the answer. If it turns out that the answer to what "good" means is to commit suicide, then I think you should feel free to go ahead and die. Actually... When that time comes, I'll die with you too. I told you! He's a real idiot! Is it okay if I die? If you know that that's what's "good," then why not? President. Can you tell me the answer right away once you find it? Of course. I promise. Then I'll wait. President. Thank you. - You did it! - President! - Well done! - That was amazing! Impressive. I'm so glad! I'm so glad! We got through this time. No. The G7 summit and that girl are both looking for the same answer. I felt that it was "good" to have her wait. Was it because it increased the amount of time she has until she dies? Is it better if that amount of time is longer? All living organisms go through a process of selection to ensure the survival of the species under the laws of natural selection and survival of the fittest. Those that disappear will disappear, and those that remain will remain for a long time. It's only natural. "Remain"? "Long"? I feel like there's a word that represents that. That's right. He said it. Justice means continuing to think about what's right. "Continue"? I see. That's right. Having organisms live. Having things continue to exist. It doesn't matter what it is. As long as it continues, then that's "good." "Good" means "continuing." We had given the name "good" to the concept of "continuing." Kanae... I have to tell her. Hardy. One more time. President. Hardy? Good job. President? Is he going back to the assembly hall? It looks like the summit has resumed. President! President! - Is that you, Seizaki? - Where's the president? He was heading for the assembly hall. All the interpreters are dead! It's Magase! Get the president! Hurry! This is a notice to all security staff! Capture the president immediately! The use of any means of wireless communication is forbidden as of now! Anyone who doesn't obey is going to end up dead! What are you doing? Has anyone seen the president? There's no trace of him passing through this way. Any info? - The wireless link is down. We can't communicate. - Continue to search for him by sight! Hey, Mr. Seizaki. Do you play games? Hurry up and find the president! If what Seizaki said is true, then we have to prepare ourselves for the worst. I've been called. Adam and Eve were seduced by an incarnation of Satan in the form of a serpent and ate the fruit of knowledge of good and evil. And then, humankind found out what evil was. No matter what anyone tells you, just don't eat the fruit. That's what's "best." But I'm going to eat it. Why? Because the fruit looks really delicious. Alex disappeared? No way. The communication links are down right now. We don't know what's going on outside. You can't leave this spot until we're sure it's safe. What's going on in there? Oh, my God! Evil. Evil is... Is contraception bad? Should we accept others who have different values? Is war bad? Do you play games? Even if no one understands. Even if no one helps. I'm evil. I'm sure you'll understand too. Who's wrong? God doesn't exist. President! Zen. President! Look at this. We're up above the venue of the summit. There's a man standing on the roof right now. It's dangerous. He could fall any minute. The man is the President of the United States, Alexander W. Wood! What's going on? Alex stopped a Japanese woman from committing suicide just now. For some reason, he's standing on the edge of the roof. I don't understand what's going on! If it turns out that the answer to what "good" means is to commit suicide, then when that time comes, I'll die with you too. This is terrible. Stop! Stop recording! We're in the air above the venue. There's another person up on the roof. It looks like he has a gun. He's in a black suit. It looks like an Asian man. - He has a gun! - Zen? He's heading towards the president! President. Zen. President! Sorry. It looks like I'm done for. I'm about to snap right now. Like the moment before a balloon bursts. Or the moment before a piece of popcorn pops. That's how I feel. If you cross it, it's going to overflow. It's the last wall. I can't last any longer. - President! - Listen to me! Zen! I understand now! Just now, I finally started to understand! What good and evil are. What good is. What evil is. It looks like we came to the same answer. I promised that once I found out what "good" is, I'd tell Kanae. But at this rate, I'd be telling her a lie. I'd be doing something that wasn't good. I'd be teaching something bad to Kanae and the whole world. The authorities said it was okay. That's wrong. Sorry, Zen-- And as for the gun I'm going to give you, I want you to use it to do the right thing. Sorry. I'm really sorry. Zen. You're a good person. The president-- The President of the United States, Alex Wood, has been shot dead! Alex! Mom? Mr. Seizaki. You're so bad. Magase! Mr. Seizaki. What is good? Good is... to continue. Mr. Seizaki. What is evil? Evil is... to end. Well then, I'm sorry, but... Bang! YAMANO-MAE Here. Good boy.
