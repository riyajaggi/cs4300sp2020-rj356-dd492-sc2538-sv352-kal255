This is the only chance I have to talk this through with him. I'm sorry.

 Taiyo, you don't have to apologize. But why? I'm the one who should apologize. I thought that you wouldn't be able to accept the truth yet. Sorry. Sorry for treating you like a kid. Why? Why are you going to die? One reason is that I'm worried about your heart. Your heart won't last much longer. But if you had your father's heart, you can survive. I knew it... No. Your heart is what made me start thinking. In fact, my suicide

 is not related to you. At first, I wanted to give you my heart. But currently, I'm not allowed to give my heart to you if I commit suicide. Not in Japan, or any other country. But I thought it would be better if it were possible. Everything I said just now will be broadcast on TV and become big news. Then many people will help you. Can you imagine it? Many people are going to help fix your heart. They'll write letters, and donate. But that's not enough. When I give my heart to you, I don't want this story to end there. It should be normal in the future. Not just organ transplants. There are many things that death can solve or improve. I think that humans can do a better job of dealing with death. Taiyo. When you want to be friends with someone, do you say bad things about them? No. I want to become friends with death. And... I want everyone else to be friends with it too. In order to do that, I have to show them myself that death isn't bad. I'm going to die in order to prove that. When that happens, my heart will be left over. What you do with it is for you to decide. Even if you're not going to use it, it's not related to my plans to die. But it'd be a waste. So use it, Taiyo. Yes. We've received many faxes and e-mails. We've also received a few messages saying... they'll let you use their own heart. I won't use them. Someone else's heart could save Taiyo's life, and then he and I could continue living together. That's one possibility for the future. But I won't choose that. I choose to die in place of someone else. The significance of the suicide law is that it makes it possible for anyone to make that decision, and for anyone to choose death. A stranger could say that they'll donate their heart. And you could refuse and choose death. What you've seen just now is just a glimpse of the future to come. This is the value system in the new era. A world in which Taiyo can live with my heart. That's the world that the suicide law will make possible. Is this what he was after? He overturned all the arguments that were prepared. The supporters for the suicide law may start to increase. No matter how it turns out, we're going to carry out our duties according to plan. The live broadcast is about to end. What do you want to do about Itsuki's wife and kid? They might go home all together. I know. Escort Team. Reassign two people from Itsuki to his wife and kid. Get them to leave separate from Itsuki. Say it's for safety. I'm addressing them as the Wife And Kid Team. Put Lieutenant Kujiin and one more person on it. Roger. Everyone, move! This is Route Guard 1. The Escort Team just passed by. Over. This is the commander. Roger. This is Route Guard 2. The escort just passed by. Over. This is the commander. Roger. This is the Escort Team. Please check. There's a commotion on the planned route. Over. Tell me the details. Over. At the north side of the hall. In the hallway near the studio. I heard something explode or burst. I don't know the details. Over. I'll contact you once I've confirmed. Proceed as planned. Over. This is the Escort Team. Roger. Thanks for waiting. We'll resume now. This is Route Guard 5. The Escort Team just passed by. Over. Commander here. Roger. What happened to the commotion by the studio? Commander to Route Guard 1. Report on your findings. Over. Route Guard 1. Over. Commander to Route Guard 2. Over. Route Guard 3. Over. Is it a communication failure? Route Guard 4. Over. Route Guard 5. Over. Route Guard 6. Over. This is Route Guard 6. Over. This is the commander. Report on your status. Over. The Escort Team hasn't passed by yet. Over. Understood. Commander to Escort Team. Over. This is the Escort Team. We're heading towards Route Guard 6. Over. Wait there until further instructions. This is the Escort Team. Roger. We'll wait. We lost contact with them after the escort team passed by. Commander to Wife And Child Team. Over. - Something's happening. - Prosecutor Seizaki. I'll go check. Okay. - Prioritize the route guards. - And the Wife And Child Team? Don't worry about it. Kujiin is on the Wife And Child Team. Roger. Sekuro to commander. Over. This is the commander. Over. I met the Escort Team right before Route Guard 6. I've confirmed Director Torao and his five men and Kaika Itsuki are here. There was nothing abnormal between the parking lot and here. Over. Commander here. Understood. Go check on Route Guards 5 through 1. Over. This is Sekuro. Roger. Hey! Mr. Seizaki! Kujiin! Kujiin! What happened? What happened? Were you shot? Damn. Mr. Seizaki... We have to get help. We have to deal with this first. Mr. Seizaki. I shot my own leg myself. It was spur of the moment. But I made a good decision. If I hadn't done it, I wouldn't have made it this far. No... It's impossible... I can't stop myself from going mad. Magase! Was that Magase? Probably. There's no one else it could have been. Kujiin! What did Magase do to you? Like this... She whispered softly in my ear. That's all she did. And she took me out. Mr. Seizaki! Don't stand up, Kujiin! I'm going to stand up! I came here because I had something to do. My radio was taken away from me. I had to tell you. I even shot my leg to come make it here. It's because you're one of my few dear friends. Run away. What? Cancel everything, and run away from this place as soon as you can. Don't try to catch her. Don't ever get involved with her ever again. She's not something that any human could handle. What are you talking about? Please understand, Mr. Seizaki. We're friends. I don't want to meet you on the other side. You idiot! You're not bleeding that heavily. You won't die from one bullet to your leg! Let's report to Director Torao. You understand too, right? You're a man, right? It's like that. It feels like sex. - What are you talking about? - You want to hold it in, you want to keep going longer, but at the same time, you want to let it out. It's like that. It's exactly like that. It feels good, right? Beyond there, there's a line. If you cross it, it's going to overflow. It's the last wall. But if you cross it, anyone would know. Even if it hasn't overflown yet. I can't take it anymore. You'd know it's going to spill. You definitely know that it's over. It's really just like that. Hey! Kujiin... Mr. Seizaki. I told you. Escort Team. Over. Route Guards! Is anyone there? Sekuro! No way... She whispers softly in your ear. Did she encourage the people she passed by to commit suicide? Did they do it just because of that? Where is she? Sekuro to commander. Sekuro! Where are you? Backstage at the NHC large hall. I'll be there in three minutes. Tell me what's going on! After I confirmed that the route guards were gone, I returned to where Director Torao was. But Mrs. Itsuki was there for some reason. They were acting weird, I'm taking cover right now. She's Magase! Be careful! She killed Kujiin! Are you able to join the Escort Team? No. I don't understand how the director is able to talk to her normally. What a sinister woman... Stay hidden there until I get there! No. She noticed me. Then run away! Right now! I'm going to work with the director and arrest Magase. Stop! It's an order! - I'm hanging up. - Sekuro! Sekuro! Sekuro! Director! Hey... Hey... You're kidding me... Director... Mr. Torao! Sekuro... Where's Sekuro? Sekuro! There was no sign of a physical struggle. And there were traces of gunpowder on the corpses. And the handwriting all matched their own on their wills. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING That wasn't a group suicide! That woman named Ai Magase killed them all! And then she kidnapped Assistant Officer Sekuro and disappeared! Prosecutor Seizaki. Get ahold of yourself. I know you're shocked, but in your testimony, you said you saw Kujiin commit suicide... CALL HISTORY ZEN Mom! Get ready! Okay! It's not... It's not over yet! If she was going to kill her, she would have made her commit suicide on the spot. Sekuro is still alive. 1 NEW MESSAGE HIASA SEKURO NO SUBJECT Like this? Viewing in progress? Mr. Seizaki! Magase! Mr. Seizaki. Can you hear me? Hey. Do you remember how I was talking about the hero? The hero who saves the world all by himself, even if the people don't help him or understand him. Sekuro. But you know, Mr. Seizaki. There's something even more wonderful. Do you know what that is? It's having the people understand the hero's dreams and feelings. Everyone understands, everyone helps, and everyone saves the world together. That's the most wonderful thing in the world, right? What are you doing? I want you to understand, Mr. Seizaki. Hey, Mr. Seizaki. We're not that different. What I'm trying to do right now is something really bad. So you'd probably tell me to stop, right? Because it's bad. What? I found this in Investigator Tsutsui's pocket. The good person in you would have told me to stop doing bad things. Hey. Magase. Stop. But I also know that it's wrong. Right? We're thinking the exact same thing. Stop! Hey! This is wrong. It's really wrong. It's really, really, wrong. There's only one difference between me and you, Mr. Seizaki. AX 5,800 YEN Magase! I'm an evil person. - Do you want to try? - Yeah! I think that's the only difference between you and me. Hey, Mr. Seizaki. Do you think it's impossible for people who like dogs and people who like cats to be compatible? Magase! Stop! I don't think so. If we understand each other, I'm sure we'll be able to understand the charm. We're the same. There are people who like good things, and people who like bad things. That's the only difference. The one and only difference. So, Mr. Seizaki. Magase! Magase! Think about it. I want you to think about why I'm doing things like this. And I want you to understand. Magase! I don't want you to think there's no meaning to it just because an evil person is doing it. I don't want you to think that a good person couldn't understand. There's a meaning to evil. Stop... But I know it's selfish of me to say I want you to understand that soon. It's because you've been raised in a good society surrounded by good things. You're a good person through and through, Mr. Seizaki. You've never thought about something bad, right? You have no idea what evil is, right? I beg you! So please try thinking about it today. Please try confronting evil for the first time in your life. I'll help you as much as I can. - Hey, Mr. Seizaki. Watch. - Magase... This is it. This is something bad. Why is it bad to kill someone? Why is it good to let people live? Why is it? Why? All right, Mr. Seizaki. Think about it. What is bad? Please stop... What is evil? I'll do it. I'll think about it. Just please, stop... You'll be okay. I'm sure you'll understand. There's nothing you wouldn't be able to understand. Because we're both human. Mr. Seizaki. I'm sure you'll understand too. I'm sure of it! You'll understand for sure.
