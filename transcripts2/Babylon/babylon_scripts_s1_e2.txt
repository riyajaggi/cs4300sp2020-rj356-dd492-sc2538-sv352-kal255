 What does... being a public prosecutor mean to you, Mr. Seizaki? Why are you asking me all of a sudden? Well... It's just... I didn't mean anything by it. I've just been wanting to hear your answer. Do you want to become a public prosecutor? What? Well... I... You're serious, right? If you are, then you should work to become the kind of public prosecutor you yourself want to be.

 Yes! So... what was your answer, Mr. Seizaki? That goes without saying. It means upholding justice and protecting people. They're going to conclude that it was a suicide based on the circumstances. So, Seizaki. Did Fumio commit suicide? That's impossible. He had no reason to. Fumio was... murdered. Do you think it's related to Shin Inaba's death? Definitely.

 Seizaki. You must get to the bottom of this. However, act even more cautiously than before. Never act alone. ATSUHIKO FUMIO Mr. Morinaga. Would it be all right if I borrowed this? Don't lose it. Yes, sir. Ms. Emiko Hiramatsu. I'll be asking you some questions. Some of these questions may be redundant. If that happens, then please answer the question with the same response one more time. Do you understand? Let's begin. Is Emiko Hiramatsu your real name? Mr. Zen Seizaki. Meaning... "just" and "good." Is there something wrong with my name? No. I just wondered what your parents were thinking about when they gave you that name. Please answer the question. Is Emiko Hiramatsu your real name? Yes. SEPTEMBER 22ND 13:06 It looks like a will. There were no traces of violence in the apartment, and no fingerprints other than Fumio's. There's no doubt that Fumio was the only person there that night. That idiot! He should have put himself in the investigator's shoes. That's asking too much of Fumio. He wasn't the type of guy who'd choose to die himself though. Let's find whoever did this... together. Yeah. Well then. Let's get to the point. I've put together the pieces Fumio left behind. I asked the company that manages the apartment where that girl Fumio followed lives and got some info on the tenants. - But... there's something peculiar about this too. - What is it? The apartment was under the name of a man called Yoshiyuki Fukuyama. He's a member of a political supporters' group. In other words, Nomaru's campaign team rented that apartment under the group's name for that girl to live in. - You'd think so, but it's not. - It's not? KAIKA ITSUKI This man is a member of Kaika Itsuki's supporters' group. Hold on! Itsuki is running against Nomaru in the mayoral election, right? Does that mean that the girl was living in an apartment rented by Itsuki's team, and that she was taken out by Ano from Nomaru's team? That's what it means. This isn't just a deal for securing votes. Buying votes with sex. Two suspicious deaths. The candidates are connected behind the scenes. This case is perfect for the Special Investigations Team. Yeah. But we can't follow this girl anymore. GIRL FROM THE RESTAURANT If Fumio really was killed by them, then they might also know about us. You're right. I'm sure she's not the only one. If Ano really is offering women to powerful men, then I'm sure just one wouldn't be enough. In fact, he brought another woman with him when he visited the university. You're right. I'm sure he has other women. - Let's start from here. - Yes. NEW WOMAN C By the way, Mr. Seizaki. I seized Professor Inaba's computer from the university. What's your relationship with Mr. Tomokazu Ano? - Our relationship? - Yes. Relationship? Well... He's an acquaintance of my grandmother. Have you known him for a long time? No, not that long. I met him for the first time when I moved to Tokyo. It was about two years ago. Have you been seeing him regularly since then? He showed me some apartments. Then he took me out to eat sometimes. And gave me clothes. They were all really expensive. I wasn't sure if I should accept. Do you know why Mr. Ano was so nice to you? - Why? - Yes. Why...? Maybe it's because I'm his friend's granddaughter. Let me ask a different question. Are you living in one of the apartments he showed you now? Yes. Mr. Ano owns the room. He said he doesn't need any rent. Why does he do so much for you? Yes. He is a really... nice person. Let me ask a different question. What were you doing on September 23? And where were you? SEPTEMBER 22ND EXTENSION Yeah. Mr. Mitoni, I sent the computer to the DF just now. Could you please analyze it? - I already turned it on. - Thanks for your help. It's a typical doctor's computer. There's a lot of data from experiments and clinical trials. INTELLIGENCE ANALYST BEN MITONI However, there's one data file that's been encrypted with strong encryption. What is it? I'm not sure. But a normal doctor wouldn't use this level of security. Can you crack it? It'll take some time. Two weeks. I see. There's only one week left until the Shiniki mayoral election. The candidates' political speeches are heating up. I will develop Shiniki into the second Tokyo. However, it would be pointless if Shiniki developed the same way as Tokyo did. Shiniki must realize that it is a new region, just as its name says. Shiniki should surpass Tokyo as a city... On the other hand, at Hashimoto Station... What the new region needs is the strength of the new generation! Our future rests on the shoulders of the new generation. ARIYOSHI HANTA - What's wrong? - Zen. We're making our move tomorrow. The future will be built by you, not by any political party! Mr. Ano took me to a hot spring yesterday. However, Mr. Ano left early. That's right. He said something came up at work, so he had to go back to Tokyo. Did you spend the night alone after that? No. I was with Mr. Ano's friends who had come to the same ryokan. - Regarding them... - Yes? How many were there? What were their names? Aren't you going to... type that in? How many were there? Yes. There were three old men. Let's see... Their names might have been Mr. Ota and I think... Mr. Kimura? SEPTEMBER 23RD 13:49 That's the members list for a golf tournament being held in Hakone today. It must have been hard to get this. I looked through the other supporter groups after the Tokyo Construction Contractors Federation. Look at the participants. The Japan Doctors League and the Tokyo Trade Union Confederation. It's weird, right? The Doctors League supports the Liberal Justice Party, and the Trade Union to the People's Life Party. They're playing golf together like friends. They picked a good location. We can't get close to them at a golf course. That's right. That's why we're focusing over here. The ryokan where they're going to stay. You didn't leak any info, right? Things would be easy if I could do that! Do you have any idea how much I had to beg my coworkers for this information? It doesn't make sense. You mean Fumio? Why did they kill him? They wanted to stop him from talking. But they were pretty rough. They killed one of us. I can't stand here doing nothing. You're right. There's no advantage. Yes. I see. We're probably heading to the same place. Yes. Thanks. What happened? It all makes sense now. HAKONE RYOKAN "GORAFUKUHANA" He got out of the car and is heading for the entrance with the woman. I'm going to wait here for a while. Okay. Thanks. Is that the woman Fumio was following? No. It's someone else. The only rooms back there are the ones the golfers are staying in. Now we're sure they're connected to Ano. Ano's leaving alone. Want me to follow him? No. Stay on the lookout here. - They came out. - Are they separate? - Kujiin. See anything around there? - It's clear. The woman's going to come out soon too. Zen. What are you going to do? No. This is the end. Hey! Zen! Excuse me. I have a few questions for you. Can you come with me to the Prosecutors Office? I'm from the Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office, Special Investigations. Do you remember the name of the third man? No. I had a bit to drink. Then please tell me what happened in the room. I listened to them talk while we ate. The three of them were friends. They had fun talking. When I refilled their glasses, they seemed so happy. I thought that was cute... as rude as that may sound. - Ms. Hiramatsu. - Yes? Did you have sexual relations with those three men? What's so funny? Nothing. Is that something that a public prosecutor would seriously ask about? But, well, that's right. This is only hypothetical. But even if I did have that kind of relationship with them, I... Love? - What? - It's love. Yes. If I was in love with them, and that was the reason I did that, then would it really be a bad thing? What are you talking about? Sometimes people fall in love at first sight. They're 40 years older than you! And even before that, there were three of them! Oh, three of them! You're right. What were their names again? Stop messing around! No one would believe that you fell in love with three old men and slept with them when you don't even know their names. People can fall in love even though they don't know their name. But... I know your name now. So I can't prove it. SEPTEMBER 24TH 14:03 What do you plan to do now that you've brought her here? Does the story make sense? I don't understand everything yet. Dr. Inaba and Fumio's mysterious deaths, and the connection between the parties. Those things are still mysteries. That's why I need that woman's testimony! If I can get her to confess that she was trying to fix the election, I can use that to get them! Mr. Morinaga! Let me take it to the Imperial Council. The Special Investigations Team has to do everything they can! The woman is still just a witness. We can't keep her for long. If we let her go, they'll know we're investigating. I'll crack her no matter what. The meeting is the day after tomorrow at 1 p.m. I'm going to send Okuda with you to witness it. - Make sure you get her testimony. - Yes. SEPTEMBER 24TH 14:12 SEPTEMBER 25TH 23:47 In other words, you want me to say that I slept with those men because Mr. Ano told me to, right? Do you want me to sign it? You want me to sign the record of confession, right? Then you'll have my testimony, right? That's right. But why are you cooperating all of a sudden? Because I feel sorry for you. - You feel sorry for me? - Yes. But in exchange, please tell me about yourself. - What? - I want to learn more about you. Yes. I want to learn about your childhood, about your family, and about your unusual name. - Why? - If you tell me, I'll sign it. Do you have a wife? - Yeah. - What about kids? - One kid. - Is it a boy? - Or a girl? - I have a son. Do you have any hobbies? Collecting fossils and minerals. What was your childhood dream? To be a prosecutor. Since you were a kid? I don't remember. And sexual intercourse. That's right. I want to ask you about sex. - What do you think about contraception? - What do you mean? Is it bad? It's not bad. If you have kids carelessly, it can be hard to raise them from a financial and environmental standpoint. Is it good to give birth to a child? Yeah. Having children and raising them should be praised. Then is it bad not to have them? That's not what I mean. We live in a time in which differences in values are respected. Should people accept others who have different values? Of course. Even values that are incompatible? We have to learn about each other's values, and coexist. If we don't accept each other, we'll end up with war. Is war bad? Of course it is. If there was a person who thinks war is bad, and a person who likes war, then should they accept each other's values and coexist? Well-- You said that having children is a good thing, and not having children isn't a bad thing either. Yeah. Then what about killing children? It's bad, of course! What's wrong with you? Are you saying that murder isn't bad? Of course not. Murder is very bad. It's the worst thing. Yes. It's terrible. The character "Sei," as in "justice." The character "Zen," as in "good deeds." Your name doesn't forgive bad deeds. Mr. Seizaki. What is justice? Hey! What happened to Hiramatsu? Hey! Okuda! She left. Damn it! Where's Okuda? He wouldn't calm down. I sent him home. I see. I'm sorry. Seizaki. Don't think too much. Just report on things the way they are. The people at the top will take care of it. Including me. Yes, sir. Thank you for your time. My report today is related to the mayoral election-- All right. Give your report, Public Prosecutor Seizaki. The story, characters, locations, and laws in this work are fictitious.
