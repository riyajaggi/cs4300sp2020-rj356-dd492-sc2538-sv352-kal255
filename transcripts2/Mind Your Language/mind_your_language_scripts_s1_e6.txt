Sure Allow me O, I'm in charge! Who wants the vino? Enter - You wanted to see me Miss Courtney? - Yes - I understand it's your birthday - That's correct! Another milestone Personally, I don't believe in celebrating birthdays I fail to see how the passing of years can be an occasion for rejoicing No of course! You're right I suppose Now Mr. Brown! When you commenced teaching here, I said I'd give you a month trial - Yes - That month is now up And I feel it's only fair to you to put an end to your worry about the future That's very kind of you Miss Courtney and I assure you, you won't regret it I know I won't Miss Hardacre will start on Wednesday - Miss Hardacre? - Yes She will be taking over your class You remember I did tell you I prefer women teachers You mean I've got the push? Let's just say we no longer require your services I feel that Miss Hardacre will be much more suitable Well in that case, I suggest you get Miss much suitable Hardacre to take over tonight Because I'm going home - You can't just walk out like that? - Oh yes I can I won't say it's been a pleasure because it hasn't All I can say is ''In lndia you'd be sacred'' 10 p.

You should be improving your mind You can improve my mind anytime! How about tonight? We have the meal, a couple of glass of vino, then back to my place to make love - That is not improving the mind - No, but it's very good for the body Teacher is coming! Would you all pay attention please! I have something rather important to tell you I'm afraid that Miss Courtney has terminated my engagement - That is very big surprise to me - Yes it was a bit of a shoc to me as well We are not knowing that you and Miss Courtney were engaged You don't understand I mean to coin a phrase I've been given the boot Si se?or, one right boot, one left boot No Juan, can't you understand! I've been fired - I've been given the bullet Santa Maria! She tried to shoot you? No, I've been dismissed - Dismissed? - Yes - You are reaving us? - I'm afraid so Mais c'est incroyable, c'est formidable enfin! - Why you leave? - Miss Courtney doesn't think I'm suitable We go speak to her I'm afraid that speaking to her won't do any good at all O.K. We twist her arms a little bit Yes, we tell here if she not let you stay, we work her over You'll do nothing of the sort! We don't have Mafia tactics in this country Vat is going to happen to us? Another teacher will be taking over the class! A Miss Hardacre - I'm already not liking her - It's not fair!

Quiet! It's really no concern of yours I'm sure you'll find Miss Hardacre more than efficient After all, a woman can do everything a man can do - Not everything - I'm speaking academically Excuse me Miss Courtney! There's a person out here who wants to see you - What sort of person? - I'm not sure - Miss Courtney? - Yes Hardacre! Oh, I thought they were sending me a woman I am a woman I do beg your pardon!

You cannot learn the English at home - Maybe I find a way - There is no way I'm thinking if we make new teacher go, perhaps Mr. Brown is coming back - How we make new teacher go? - Very easy That's not good! We get the blood all over the class Much better we push her out of the window It is looking like we are being stuck with her We must do something - It is duty to obey erected authorities - Not so - Raws are made to be obeyed - Not if laws is bad law - Principals action unjust - He's right But what do we do? There's nothing we can do - Hey, I got an idea - What idea? - We have a strike - Yeah, let's have the strike What is a strike? Does this mean we are going to be fighting? No, no, no! A strike! It's like a big onions - Vat onions? - The trade onions Excuse please! I am thinking your strike not going to be woring - What we are needing is to be revolting - And I'm thinking you are already revolting You are asking for kick up the Khyber!

You, your name? You, name? I see Well, I don't know how long you think you can keep this up But I assure you, you won't make any difference to me I'm just gonna sit here until somebody speaks You've squashed my apple strudel! I think I've got most of it off now - I'll be sending the bill of course - I thought you might If you don't mind, I'll have that cup of coffee now So sorry, I'm afraid I've drank it all! You'll find the tea room down the corridor Tea room! Tea room! You surely don't expect me to queue up with all the students! Oh no, no, no While I'm teaching here, I take my coffee in your office! Black, no sugar And while I'm here, I'll just look through your prospectus From the little I've seen, you could do a great deal of reorganisation - Who is it? - It's me Gladys with the coffee and biscuits Come in - You look a bit harrassed - I am harrassed - It's that new teacher, isn't it? - Yes The foreign students haven't spoken a word since Mr. Brown left As a result, Miss Hardacre is spending her time reorganizing the entire school She's already reduced two other teachers to tears And caused the caretaker to hand in his notice It's only a matter of time before she takes over my job Why don't you get rid of her and as Mr. Brown to come back? - I can't do that - Why not? Not after dismissing him! I have my pride Mind you if he asked to come back, I'd be only too happy to accept - As to come back? - We miss you Loo, when I got your message to call here - I thought it was something serious - But we are serious If you asked Miss Courtney she's gonna have you back No, I'm sorry! It's out of the question! If she wants me back, she'll have to ask me Now, if that's all, I'll say goodbye Mr. Brown please - I was just seeing somebody - I was just going to look in on your old class - I was wondering - I was wondering - Sorry - After you No, no, no after you! Well I was just wondering whether you'd consider coming back I was just going to ask if there was any chance of me coming back - That's settled then - I thought you preferred women teachers I do, but Miss Hardacre was more masculine than most men I've met - Well, you want the job back or don't you? - Yes Good, you've got it We win, we win! Mr. Brown is coming back If you'd all sit down! We've a lot of catching up to do I'm afraid Excuse please! Before we are doing that we are all changing your birthday pens And buying you other gift from Arrods - The Camden Arrods you mean? - Oh yes indeed - Here you are - Thank you! A wallet A wallet?
