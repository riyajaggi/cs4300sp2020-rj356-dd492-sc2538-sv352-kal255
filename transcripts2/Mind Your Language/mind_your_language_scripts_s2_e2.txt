We've had some news from the Palace - Victoria or Crystal? - Buckingham I'm here in connection with the Royal visit to the borough next week As the Duke himself laid the foundation stone of this building It has been suggested that their Royal Highnesses pay a brief visit to your school The Queen, and Prince Philip are coming here? - Next Tuesday - Did you hear that Mr. Brown? They're coming here, the two of them together, in person! Him and her Calm down Miss Courtney - Don't over-excite yourself - Who's getting overexcited? I'm perfectly calm about the whole thing I've seen some strange things on toilet doors Boys and girls, lads and lasses, pointers and setters But I've never seen Dukes and Queens - It's not for them to use - What is it for then? It's Miss Courtney's idea She didn't wanna offend the Royal family by letting them see toilet doors So I've done the best thing I've disguised them - Very diplomatic - No, just a waste of time Mr. Brown They must have loos in Buckingham Palace Absolutely! Is the old battleaxe in yet? The old battleaxe is here I wasn't meaning you Miss Courtney - I trust you were not referring to her Majesty - Oh no I was referring to Gladys, the tea lady - Here - What's this for? Well it's not for sticking in your buttonhole! It's to wave at the Royal Couple - Are you going to change? - Into what? You surely don't intend to greet out distinguished guests in thatjacket Haven't you anything a little more formal? I've got a black tie I wear for funerals Here - That's better - I feel as if I'm going to a cup final Sidney, go and sweep the schoolyard - I've swept it once - Well sweep it again You wouldn't want me to go down on my hands and knees and scrub it, would you? Don't be ridiculous! It wouldn't dry before they arrived I think I'll go and polish the silver What silver? I brought my silver tea set in case they wanted a drink Perhaps the Duke prefer a trot of rum, being an ex-naval man I never thought of that He'll have to make do with sherry Shall I ask Gladys to make up a few ham rolls In case they're a bit peckish Ham rolls? You can't give royalty Ham rolls This is a very special occasion! Tell her to open a tin of salmon This is a very special occasion! Tell her to open a tin of salmon - They won't want anything to eat - Better to be prepared I wonder if we should have got a red carpet Why don't you go the whole hog And ask the music class to play the National Anthem as they enter! This is supposed to be an informal visit I don't think you're approaching this special occasion with the proper attitude - And I think you're being carried away - Nonsense This is an opportunity for all the staff and students To show their loyalty and devotion to our sovereign It's up to the entire school to make a good impression One never knows where it may lead The New Year's Honours list isn't far away - Honour's list? - Yes - A knighthood could be within your grasp - A knighthood Mr. Jeremy Brown Arise Sir Jeremy - Mr. Brown - Yes your Majesty? - I beg your pardon - Sorry, I thought you were the Queen - Have you been drinking? - No, just day dreaming Well you'd better wake up They are due to arrive in half an hour - Now where are your students? - In the cloakroom changing - Changing? - Yes I insisted on wearing the natural costumes Gladys! Gladlys, are you there? What? Blood and thunder! It's Rule Brittania - Don't you like it? - What? - Don't you like it? - Very patriotic I don't know whether to salute you or run you up a flagpole - I've got a surprise for you - Yeah - Look - Oh my God That should surprise the Duke Surprise him! Lt'll paralyse him You're supposed to courtesy not flash him your underwear Any of my students... Good heavens Don't say anything otherwise she'll show you her knickers They will come up here , won't they? - Yes, I expect so Gladys - I do hope so I think Prince Philips's lovely and I've always been fond of sailors Don't forget, he belongs to the Queen Have you seen any of my students? They're still changing - Go and tell them to hurry up Sid - All right I'd better get tidied up too! The duke might want to inspect my utensils Ready for your inspection Sir Carry on Sid Miss China Is that your National Costume? This is uniform of People's army of Ribelation as plesclibed by Chairman Mao You dont rike it? I feel it lacks a certain finish A belt of ammunition and a couple of hand grenades Miss India Very nice Jamila It is Jamila, isn't it? Miss Germany - What you think? - Very teutonic Miss Sweden - Beautiful yes? - Beautiful very - And the clothes too? - I was referring to the clothes Miss France What do you think? - Tre's belle - Merci che'ri Miss Greece - Don't take the mickey - Sorry! Mr. Greece - Are you comfortable in that Max? - It's a bit cold boss Mr. Pakistani God Bless Queen Elizabeth not forgetting the Duke of Edinberg - The Duke of Edingburgh - Him also Italy Are you representing Italy or the Mafia? I represent Sicile! Mr. Punjab - Most endearing Ranjeet - Thank you very much Mr. Hungary - Very good Zoltan - Thank you Mr. Japan - Nankipoo I presume - Ah so And last but not least Mr. Spain - Professori, there still nobody coming - Any minute now Come on in your places everyone Where's Zoltan? - He's gone to try and find the toilet - That may take him a while I'd like to stress that this visit is informal So her majesty may not necessarily come into this classroom You mustn't be too disappointed if she doesn't But if she does, I want you all to behave just as if she weren't here, understand? In view of the occasion, it would seem appropriate To tell you a little of the history of our British Kings and Queens It all started with the Norman Conquests I have seen that on the television! Very funny English play I'm referring to the actual invasion of England by William of Normandy - It was 1066 - Wrong I beg your pardon 1066... Maybe 1056 - It was 1066 - No, cannot be 1066 Sixty minutes in one hour 1066 is six minutes past eleven - 1066 was the year - It's all right William of Normandy, by the way does anybody know... What other name he was known by? William the... - Concurer - Conqueror Hokay He was succeeded by his third son William Rufus the Red King Oh blimey, you are having a Communist King No, he was called the Red King because of his red hair Jolly good William Rufus died in 1100 after being struck by an arrow in the woods Maybe it was Robin the Hood Robin the hood Robin Hood wasn't born then! He was in the Middle ages How can he be middle ages if he is not yet being born? Never mind about Robin Hood, alright? Oh yes, very colourful Sorry to interrupt Mr. Brown but they will here in any moment now And I thought it would be rather nice if one of your students present this to her Majesty I'll do that It is usual for the bouquet to be presented by a lady With that skirt, who's gonna know the difference? Come outside and I'll show you Sit down, who do you suggest Miss Courtney? How about Jamila? Jamila darling, would you come here? Anf for goodness sake girl, get rid of that knitting Now Jamila! I want you to wait with me in the hall until her Majesties arrive And then you can present this to the queen You courtesy first and then you give it to her Now let's try it I'm the Queen You are Miss Courtney No, no, no, Jamila! Come on, she's just pretending I am understand Here you are Queenie! You don't speak until you're spoken to and then you address her as Ma'am! Now let's try again Ah, there you are Superintendant, how soon the Royal Couple are here? - They are not coming - What? We've had to rearrange the schedule They're going straight from the hospital to the Town Hall We're cutting out their visit to the school - I'd better tell Miss Courtney! - There is no time! You must come with me now!
