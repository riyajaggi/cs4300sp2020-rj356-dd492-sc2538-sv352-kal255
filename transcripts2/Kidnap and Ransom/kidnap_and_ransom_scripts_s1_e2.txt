 Kidnap and Ransom (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 Having shot and killed the original kidnappers interlopers take Naomi to a new hideout where she meets urbane, sinister Alexander Willard. King and his assistant Carrie meet local police inspector Lanning, who tells them that one of the dead men was a security guard at Naomi's firm, which is presumably how she was targeted. King negotiates with Willard and Naomi is released safely for four hundred thousand pounds, though King is surprised that a professional abductor agreed to such a comparatively low sum. His suspicions are confirmed when Naomi's little girl Sally is taken from her home in London by Willard.

 Benjamin! (MUFFLED SHOUTING) 'We've got your wife.' He said, "Don't go to the police. Get your money ready." You don't count as the police. No, certainly not. Philip, there are two of them. You don't have to do this any more. How long has Tess been wearing that cross? Are you listening to me? I can get you $50,000. MIKEY: I'll kill her first! We've got a lot of questions about a missing woman. I wish I could help you, Inspector Lanning.

 Come to me! Come to my voice! (MAN SCREAMING) (DIETER SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) Pass me the Medi Kit. Come on, come on. (MUFFLED CRY) It's just a flesh wound. (PHONE RINGS) It's Dominic. Angela, I lost my hostage. The handover was ambushed. The kidnappers were taken out. Naomi snatched. What about the money? And the money. (SIRENS WAIL) The police are coming. Dominic, get out of there right now. No. I've got to stay or it will cause more problems. Dominic, we do not want a mess with the police!

 Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've got a name for you. Samuel Mfana. Mike, Foxtrot, Alpha, November, Alpha. He's one of the original kidnappers. Naomi got hit. Do you hear me? She got hit. Whoever took her might use a hospital. All right, check the hospitals. I gotta go. Drop the gun! Drop the gun! On your knees! OK, I'm going down. Slowly. (RINGS) Hello, Angela. What happened? What is it? Let's go, sweetheart. That's it. He's dead, you let him die. His family don't want a dead man. Just business. Naomi, come to me! Come to my voice! I lost my hostage. How could this happen twice? Mr Shaffer... How did these other kidnappers even know about Naomi? That's what we're trying to establish. How the hell did he get it so wrong? Sometimes hostage victims are passed up the kidnap chain. They... You have no idea who's got her. The new kidnappers seem to be professionals, which will make negotiating with them much more straightforward. Naomi's a valuable commodity to them, they'll want to protect that. They've got Naomi and the money? Yes. Will our insurance still cover this? We'll deal directly with Lloyds about the second payout. Your negotiator stood by while my wife was shot. Mr King is doing everything possible to resolve the situation. I gave you friendly advice, Mr King. Good advice. "Keep me informed. Don't ride roughshod over my authority." Clearly the message didn't get through. I'm going to have to try a different approach. Why were you there, Inspector Lanning? What? The middle of nowhere - you got there quickly. Someone heard gunshots, gave us a call. 12 men, four cars, arrived in three minutes. That's remarkable. I must have been tipped off by the kidnappers? I...must be corrupt? I don't know. Are you? I tracked your rental car from your hotel. But we lost the signal for about 20 minutes. Pity. I could've had the kidnappers and Naomi Shaffer. Do you know how most kidnap victims get killed? Tell me. Police rescue attempts. (LAUGHS) That's funny, cos... I can't imagine anyone doing a worse job than you did. You were found with a dead body. With a gun. I could hold you here...for a very long time. Who took Naomi? I don't know. But you know something. One of the men had a tattoo on the inside of his wrist. White man, white wrist. It's a dagger in a flame. That's military. Interesting. I'm gonna let you go...on one condition. You keep me informed. This new lot calls you, you call me. Will you do that? No. Give him his stuff, let him go. Er... Just one thing. This. Samuel Mfana, I'll check it out. (PHONE RINGS) Dom, are you all right? Don't worry, it's OK, I'm out now. I'm going to stay in Cape Town and wait for the call. So can you get Carrie out here? Sure. I'll get her on a flight. When you can, all right. Bye. (MAN SCREAMING) DIETER: You had to go and get greedy... Aaargh! You little greedy fuck! Aaargh! Please, please don't hurt me! I went along with Mikey. But I called you in the end! I know that, Sammy. But you still haven't told me what the moneyman told you! Aargh! Tell me now! You want to see what pain is? (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (GUNSHOT) (WHIMPERS) Sit. Sorry about the noise, and the stench. So where did your interest in plants come from? Grow your own at college? I tried that once. Bought the lamps and everything. Total disaster. So what was it? Window boxes. Me and Mum had a top floor flat. That's crafty, Naomi. Very crafty. Did you go on one of those courses? Kidnap and Ransom: What To Do In The Event Of. "Remind your kidnapper you're not just a price tag, you're a human being." I didn't mean anything by it. Too late. I'm hooked, totally hooked. Where was Dad in this top floor flat? He was dead. Good answer. And a true one, to boot. I'm sure he'd be proud of you. (GAGS) (CRIES OUT) (GUNSHOTS) Up now! Come on! Is that the girl? Yes, yes! Is that the girl? Yes! You're gonna be sorry, Sammy! (SCREAMS) We trusted you! Angela, did you get anything back on Samuel Mfana? Yes, he was a security guard for a firm called Citadel. I think he knew the gang who've taken Naomi. (SHOUTING) I just assumed word had got round. White woman hostage... I'll do it. Thank you. ..time and place of handover. But you now think they knew each other. Yeah, I do. (FOOTSTEPS) I want a bathroom. I want a bathroom. I'm looking for Inspector Lanning. All right. Thanks. Inspector? (SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE) DOMINIC: Thank you. How did you find me? I bribed your desk sergeant. This is Carrie Heath, she works with me. Inspector Lanning. Hi. Samuel Mfana, the name you gave me... Yeah. He was murdered. They dumped his body outside his house, yesterday. Did you know that? No, I didn't know that. Would you have told me if I hadn't found you here? No. Now I've got three homicides and a missing person. Nice work, Mr King. Anyway, this place belongs to Samuel's friend, Mikey Snyders. Gang boy, small fry. I wonder...what made him interested in Mrs Shaffer? Shall I show you where they held her? What are you doing here? I want to help. Samuel Mfana, he worked for Citadel Security? What's your point? The guys with the tattoos they were with... White Plains Regiment. I followed up on that. Ex-military, most go into security. Couldn't they have worked for Citadel Security as well? See, my point...is that I think Samuel and his friend, they knew these people. You think or you know? Well...I think. Well, if you'd seen what they did to his body you'd certainly say they had a score to settle. Kidnap to order, they didn't deliver so they thought they'd keep the money. And Samuel, he was the one who got punished. I've got a few phone calls to make. Don't go anywhere. Thank you. (FLIES BUZZING) Oh, God! Well, listen to this. Samuel Mfana worked with an ex-marine called Dieter DeVries, ex-White Plains Regiment, on a security job for Citadel last summer. What was the job? ConradVictra Pharmaceuticals. Interesting, eh? Do you think that that's maybe how they found out about Mrs Shaffer? They're in the same world. Pharmaceuticals. We're going to go to the DeVries residence now. It's not my place here, Inspector, but that's not a good idea. You don't want to destroy the only link we have to Naomi. Don't worry, if she's not there, we'll make sure he tells us where she is. But what worries me is if she is there. You're welcome to join us, Mr King. Police rescue attempts. Yeah, yeah, I heard you the first time. Make the call now. (RINGING TONE) (PHONE RINGS) Jane Wickham. Can you talk, Jane? Are you alone? Who is this? Someone with an interest in the welfare of Naomi Shaffer. Who are you? A businessman. Do you have Naomi? What I want to know, Jane, is what Naomi is worth to your company? What's in her head? Is it gold? I can't talk to you. Just tell me what's she worth to your company. I thought she was going to build you a factory, make you lots of money. I can't talk to you about this. I'll give you the number of our response specialists. I don't wanna talk to any bloody response specialists, I wanna talk to... It's a London number. 0207... 946... 0233. Jane... Get up! (SHOUTING) It's not them. WOMAN: What have I done? I haven't done... DeVries' wife. Says she hasn't seen him in months or heard from him. Same story at Citadel Security. That's a bit of luck for you. What do you mean? If they had been holding her there, she'd be dead by now. (PHONE RINGS) It's Angela. Hello. The kidnappers made contact with Jane Wickham. I'm sending you the recording now. Good. Send it. That means she's alive. Wickham gave them your crash number, expect their call. (PHONE RINGS) Hello. Dominic King. Yes. Can I ask you what your name is? We might be talking quite a lot, so what would you like me to call you? Don't call me anything. Are you there? Yes, I'm here. You're the "response specialist", so respond. First I need to know that you have Naomi and that she's in good health. I have Naomi and she's in good health. She was shot. The wound's been seen to. I need to speak to her. You need to go back to the insurance company and find out... No, until I hear from Naomi, I cannot negotiate on her behalf. Talk. Hello? Naomi. I'm the negotiator. Dominic King. Please, get me out of here. Keep calm. Naomi, I want you to tell me where you and your husband were married? What are you talking about? In what church were you and your husband married? We weren't married in a church. Please... That's enough. Please tell Sally I love her. Sssh! Take her back. (CRACKLING) Are you on a radio? So? Taking all the precautions. Using a radio strap. I sense a military brain. Here's the deal. I know she has kidnap insurance. Anything less than the max and she's dead. Do you understand? I don't know the max. Well, I'll call you again. (SIGHS) (RUNNING WATER) Don't worry, it'll heal. You're still pretty. Can I have a cigarette? I didn't know you smoked. There you go. (COUGHS) God. It's strong. Don't breathe in so deep, you'll be sick. Aaargh! (SHOUTING) She's out! (CRIES OUT) NAOMI: I'm sorry. Argh! Fook...fookin' get away with it! NAOMI: (SOBS) I'm sorry. Sorry. (BRIN CRIES OUT IN PAIN) Best thing about breaking up is making up. I'm sorry, no. No! (CLOTHES TEAR) (NAOMI SCREAMS) I'll make you some dinner in a minute. I don't want dinner, thank you. Fine, then don't eat. Bought all this food for nothing. (PHONE RINGS) (STOPS RINGING) Oh! Hi, it's me. I've been trying to get hold of you guys. Hope you're OK. I'm fine. Everything's going... slow here, as always. Anyway... Call me. I miss you both. Lots of love. Now don't your nails look nice? Colour looks great. Sharon...have you ever known families where the mother didn't come home? Sal, I've got to get to work now. You all right? I'll see you tonight. Everything's going to be fine. Bye. OK. Bye. OK. Have you got your inhaler? Two million dollars, that's what I want. That sort of money doesn't exist. Well, then, goodbye. No. We can talk about this. Talk all you want, she's dead. You...you go down that road, nobody wins. Two million dollars. King? Hello? Are you there? (SPLASHING) What's that noise? It's me. I'm having a pee. You have to drink a lot of water in the heat. Well, go right ahead. I should apologise. What? Calling you Mr King. Should be Colonel. (TOILET FLUSHES) I said it should be Colonel. The 9th/12th Dragoons, no less. (TOILET LID CLATTERS) Hello? Hang on a minute. Sorry, I can't hear you. (RUNNING WATER) What? Are you...? King? Are you there? Sorry? (CRACKLING) You finished now? So you looked me up. Well done. Are you alone, King? In what sense? In the sense is anyone else listening? Yes. Good. You could've lied. Never promise, never lie. What's that, words of wisdom for the negotiating professional? OK, Colonel, if you're a man of your word, then you tell me what she's worth. You want me to give you a figure? I want you to give me a figure. 400,000. You've already got 100,000. Half a million dollars. (HANGS UP) What do you think? I think he's going to settle. Two million to 400,000, in one conversation. That's impressive. I just didn't expect it all to happen...so quickly. Naomi, come to me! Come to my voice! I lost my hostage. He's dead, you let him die. His family don't want a dead man. Just business. AMANDA: Where did you go after the handover? We couldn't reach you. I've never lost a hostage, took a bit of processing. (PHONE RINGS) Yeah, we have a deal. (DOOR UNLOCKED) Naomi... I've agreed a price. I'm sending you home. You remember what that means? You'd better. Are you getting me? Say something. Ba bom bom. Yeah. Good. (MESSAGE ALERT) Bank account information's come through. Got it. Yeah. (PHONE RINGS) I'm here. I know. Two of you. You're showing your age, Colonel. I am my age. Do you have Naomi? I do. Money first. It doesn't work like that. No money until I see Mrs Shaffer. You're a very obstinate man. Man with a wheelchair. Quarter to 12. Quarter to 12, in a wheelchair. See her yet? Do you see her? I see her. You make a move and she dies. Is she all right? She's fine. She's sleeping. Just send the money. I'm telling you, Colonel, go anywhere near her, you die. OK, that's enough. Just send the money now or you both get a bullet. You want me to take that shot, boss? Last chance. Naomi, it's Dominic. Sorry. You're OK now. You're going home. Send the money or you're both dead. Do it, Carrie. Done. (PHONE RINGS) Yeah? Funds are cleared. Gone through? Yes, sir, transaction complete. Pleasure doing business with you, Colonel. I'm sorry. All right? Sorry... All right. Your mum's coming home, Sal. She's coming home. (SOUNDTRACK OVER SPEECH) Goodbye. Thank you, Mr King. Hi. All right? Take care. How is she? Physically OK. They fixed her up in Cape Town, ran all the standard tests, virals, HIV. Was she raped? She's not saying much. But she's going to need to talk to somebody. She didn't want to go to the hospital here? No, she wanted to go straight home. So do I. (PHONE RINGS) OK... Dominic King. Mr King, it's Lanning. How can I help you, Inspector Lanning? Can you help me? (MOURNFUL SINGING) Cos I suspect even if you could, you wouldn't. You're home safe, Naomi Shaffer with you. Yeah, we got lucky. Naomi was released. Luck had nothing to do with it, just money. Do you know where I am? I'm watching Benjamin Sisulu get buried. The murdered taxi driver, remember him? His wife and kids dressed smart. Sad, you know. Cos the son of a bitch who caused his death is probably a million dollars richer. Are you proud of yourself, Mr King? Is that what you're calling about, Inspector? Yeah, I guess it is. Hello? Tess? Tess? Hi. You OK? Sorry, I didn't think you were coming home. Sorry. Do you mind, I'm... It kept me safe. Does it feel good to be home, Mummy? It feels wonderful, my love. It's what kept me going, thinking of you. I cried every single night. I'm so sorry. I've taken tomorrow off. And I can take the rest of the week off too. No, It's all right. I don't need you to, I'm fine. No, darling, I'd like to. Maybe we should let Mum get some rest. (PHONE RINGS) It's all right, darling, I'll get it. Dom, I'm taking the mirror system off the Shaffer phones, right? No, leave it on, please. Another 48 hours. No, it comes off. She's been back a few days. Well, go on then. Out with it. Just wouldn't hurt to keep an eye on her a little longer. It's illegal. Why would you want to? Because I don't think we've got the full story. From Naomi? What about? About any of it, really. About why they released her, for instance. We won this one. Enjoy it, move on. Thank you for bringing me home. I'm so grateful. Well, if I hadn't, I was going to pack it in, what I do. Sorry, I have absolutely no idea why I told you that. Why would you stop? My last situation, a...hostage died. And? Isn't that like a doctor saying, "I lost a patient so I'm going to hang up my..." What is it doctors hang up? Stethoscopes? Stethoscope. I still really have no idea why they released you. The insurance payment? They were professionals. No negotiator in the world can make 400,000 look good to someone who wants two million. Well, I'm free. Does it matter why? I hope not. Thank you. I'm just pleased to be home. How is everything with your husband? Forgive me, it's just sometimes... it can be difficult. to explain exactly what you went through. No, Philip's been great. He really has. Top myself up. I'm fine. (CAR ALARM DISABLED) You sat on their heads? (LAUGHTER) You go to sleep, OK? Night-night. Now snuggle down. Night-night, my love. Night, Mum. I'm glad that you're home. (DIALS NUMBER) (PHONE RINGS) Hi. Hi, darling. Are you OK? (SOBS) I mean, I know you're not OK, but... When are you coming home? An hour or two. What is it, Naomi? What is it? Please tell me. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Talk to me, honey, please. Naomi. Oh, it's all right. Erm... I'm going to bed now. OK. I won't be long. (PHONE RINGS) Philip? No, it's not Philip. I'm disappointed. Why have you been talking to Dominic King? He asked to see me. How do I know that? I didn't say anything. I thought we had a deal. I promise you. I don't think I can rely on you, Naomi. (LINE GOES DEAD) Hello? Hello? (MUFFLED SCREAM) Hello, pretty. Don't move. No police. (PHONE RINGS) We made a deal and a deal has to be honoured. I know she's alive. You do this and we're finished. This isn't a war. Well, that's what you tell yourself. I'm just asking you to use your relationship with the kidnappers. It's an unacceptable risk, you're not playing a game. Promise me you'll get her back. (GUNSHOTS) Do we have a deal or not? itfc subtitles / Sync by GeirDM for www.addic7ed.com Warning: fopen(srtcache/Kidnap and Ransom/Kidnap and Ransom - 01x02 - Episode 2.HDTV/FOV.English.HI.orig.Addic7ed.com.srt) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/admin/domains/addic7ed.com/public_html/downloadoriginal.php on line 130
