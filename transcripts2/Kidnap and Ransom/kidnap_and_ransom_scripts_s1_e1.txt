 Kidnap and Ransom (2011–…): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 After his first failure to secure the release of a live hostage, kidnap negotiator Dominic King returns from South America to England and is surprised to find his teen-aged daughter has found religion. His business partner Angela sends him to Cape Town where Naomi Shaffer, a botanist working for a pharmaceuticals firm, has been snatched by two local men. King assumes that they are opportunistic amateurs, working alone and is successful in halving their ransom request to a million dollars. A hand-over goes ahead but is ambushed by a group of masked men who escape with Naomi and the ransom money.

 Are you getting me? Yeah. OK. Didn't we come up this way a couple of years ago? You're thinking of Columbia. Same mountain ranges. Different country. Here they come. (SPEAKS SPANISH) OK. Dominic. Que pasa, ese? You have the money? What we agreed - $150,000. Should be more, no? Come on, Ramon. It's been ten months.

 Let's just...do this and then we can go home. (SPEAKS SPANISH) What's this? What happened to him? He would not eat. He got sick. Like I said, he is sick. Needs a doctor, no? He's dead. You let him die. You took too long. You, with all your talk, talk, talk, talk, talk... We're giving him back to you. His family don't want a dead man. What good is a dead man to them? You just give us the money, OK? You don't, I take it anyway. Maybe I kill you, too. 'Are you threatening me, Barbosa?' Just so I'm clear.

 No. I don't threaten you. Just business. (SPEAKS SPANISH) A gun? Dominic... Gracias. Vamanos! Vamanos! Rapido. I just... I just thought it might come in handy. I missed the part where it came in handy. Look, Dom - Don't do guns, Frank, ever. No exceptions. Barbosa's got a point. All of this talk and... Give me the gun, Frank. (SIGHS) (ENGINE STARTING) No! Dominic, wait! You can't do this! Dominic! Just business. The negotiation was sound. Well, apart from you leaving Frank in the Andes. Now he knows how I feel about guns. That he does. Anyway, where did you go after the hand over? We couldn't reach you. I've never lost a hostage. It took a bit of processing. 150 grand for a corpse. If that's business as usual, business is going to dry out fast. They didn't mean to kill Mark Turner. You try telling that to his wife. I did, this morning. Look, I'm sorry, Dom, but next time they bring us a corpse, we bring them an empty briefcase. If that means hiring local muscle, so be it. You know, Angela, we bring guns, we're picking a fight we can't win. Ladies and gentlemen, I am Angela Beddoes from Beddoes King Associates. We are the leading hostage release negotiators working in the corporate field today. You all work for companies that send you abroad, often to the world's trouble spots. You're important people, valuable people, which is why your companies have taken out ransom policies on you. (TRAIN BRAKES SCREECHING) Thank you very much. (SEAGULLS CALLING) MAN: As well as the general eyesore created by the caravans, there's the hygiene issue. Excuse me. Hi, Daddy. Hi, darling. MAN: I for one don't want gangs of... How was your trip? Fine. That's nice. WOMAN: I've been in their caravans. They're spotless. And travellers have camped on that field since before my grandfather's time. It's not illegal in terms of use... Dom. You didn't have to. I certainly did, seeing as how you plan to flood my back yard with pikeys. RUFUS: Colonel King. Rufus. We wanted a few minutes. I hope you're not stealing her. I am actually. Well, we are. Oh. Well, no problem. It won't be as easy once Westminster gets its claws into her. Goodbye, Sophie. Bye. What's this about Westminster? Oh, Rufus is always plotting. Look, I need to go. I said I'd see Marion at the centre. Aren't you gonna eat with us? I've made dinner. See you later. Well done, by the way. Thanks. Is she all right? I don't know, Dom. What's this centre? Nice doing business. Good to see you. Good to see you. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Take care. I'll see you. Bye. To the airport? Oh, please. OK. Very beautiful, Mrs Shaffer. Coleonema album - Breath of Heaven. It's amazing what this little flower can do. Are you ready to go home? Oh, yes. Then let's go. So, you're looking forward to seeing your daughter? Oh, yes. It's been far too long again. But you'll see your family later, won't you? What's going on? Stay in the car. Benjamin! Get off me! Help me! Benjamin! (SCREAMS IN AFRIKAANS) Benjamin! I'm so sorry, Dom. His poor family. Children? Their nine-year-old, Katie, stopped talking three months ago and they still haven't told her that her father's dead. Look, you know, you don't have to do this anymore - be out in the field and everything. Say something, please. Is that what you'd like? Of course I would. I know it's selfish. I know what you do is important. But? But it's my turn now, my chance. What? Oh. Westminster, of course. Well, maybe, one day. Who knows? But I want you to be there with me. I've been there for you. If-if-if I'd brought Mark Turner... ..back home alive and returned him to his family, would you still be asking me to stop? That is an unfair question to ask me and you know it. How long has Tess been... wearing that cross? Are you listening to me at all? (SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) (SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) All right. (DOGS BARKING) Have a problem, Sammy? You have a problem, Sammy, huh? Yeah. So do you. We're taking all the risk and we're taking all the money. OK, Sammy? OK? (COUGHS) Blue or red for the M? I think you're changing the subject. Bed, now. Red it is, then. And then straight in, all right? (PHONE RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) Hello. We've got your wife! Sorry? 'We've got your wife.' And she's not coming home. I can't understand you. Who are you? Get your money ready. And don't go to the cops! So, where is she? Who are you? Dad, look. I finished it. Dad? OK, Carrie, brief me. Thank you. Naomi Shaffer, Helding Pharmaceuticals. Cape Town, South Africa, yesterday PM. One call to the home. Unidentified African male demanding money, no police. Person to call at Helding is CEO Jane Wickham. I've send you the the email. Yeah. Anything on the call? No. Blocked. Nothing there. Thanks, Carrie. (SIRENS) WOMAN: What did you see? (CHILDREN SCREAMING) Get these kids out of here. Kill the black man, take the white woman. Why not, eh? (PHONE RINGING) Carrie. I've got the British Consulate from Cape Town. No. I don't want to speak to them. 'Tell them to keep the media out.' OK. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Are you here because of my mum? I know something's happened to her. I'd like to talk to your father for a few minutes, if that's OK? We can have a chat later if you want. He said, 'Don't go to the police, get your money ready.' You don't count as the police, do you? No, most certainly not. Their main concern is catching the kidnappers. My sole concern is bringing your wife back home. OK. How much will they want? Will her insurance cover it? Don't worry about that. That's all in place. With permission, I'd like to bring a family liaison officer, Sharon Fenerty, to live in your home. Why? What for? To support you and your daughter. Right? Yes, of course. Frank here's setting up an echo system on your computers and phones. So all the phone calls will come directly through to us, at Beddoes King, first. OK. So, this is what you do - negotiate with criminals, reward them for committing their crimes? Well, I like to think of my job as returning people to their families. And when was the last time you didn't bring someone home alive? (PHONE RINGING) Do you want me to answer that? Erm...all right. Do you authorise me to speak on your behalf? Yes. I need to hear you say it. I authorise you to speak, yes. Frank? Witnessed. Good. (RINGING CONTINUES) Hello. Who's this? My name is Dominic King. I want to speak to the Philip man. Philip, I need some information. I need to know which church you and Naomi were married in. What? This is very important. This is proof of life. We weren't married in a church. If you're the police, I'll kill her! I assure you I'm not the police. I work for Philip Shaffer and his family. But I need to speak to Naomi. If we're to start negotiating, I need to know that she is all right. She's fine. She's very happy. Her family is very, very frightened for her. Please...let me talk to her. Please. No! You can see her on the screen like you always do! What the hell was that? Excuse me, what did he say? What's going on? How do you normally communicate with your wife when she's away? Skype. OK. I think we should do this, Mr Shaffer. No. I need to be here. We don't know what we're going to see, Mr Shaffer. This is my wife! I need to see this! Let me see her. Wake up! Make a call to your husband! Use the computer! Call him! OK, I am. I am! Hurry up! I'm doing it, I'm doing it! (RINGING) She's gonna talk now! Talk to them. Talk to them. Look, Philip, can you hear me? Yes, darling, I can hear you. Philip, these people want $2m. Philip, please just get the money. Just talk to Jane. Get the money or they're gonna kill me! We'll get the money. Say the words. Say it - about the police! Philip - Say it! There are two of them. No! No! (GUNSHOT) Mr Shaffer, I - Dad, I thought I heard mum's voice. What's happening? Let's er... Let's go and have our chat. What were you thinking of - letting the husband see the Skype? He er...  He asked to see it. For God's sake, Tom, they're your procedures. You say no. You say, 'Absolutely blood not.' Angela, you can't just say no. It's his wife. Well, then, why didn't you secure the child? Sharon hadn't arrived, we were shorthanded. It's not ideal, I admit that. No, it wasn't. It was a disaster. Not to mention the very real possibility our hostage is dead. She's not dead. She's not. Dominic, you have absolutely no idea if she's alive or not. These men are young, they're desperate and unprofessional. But they're not without motive. They want to be rewarded. Unless you panicked them, unless they decided to quit while ahead. OK. Naomi Shaffer is alive. The kidnappers will call back. Trust me. Please. What is that? It's a molecular structure. It's my dad's. Sharon, do you often do this - move into other people's houses? Yeah, when I have to. But before, you were a policeman. Police WOMAN. Why did you leave? Because of the glass ceiling? How do you know about that? My mum told me. But I think it was just a lie to get me to work harder at school. Good for your mummy. Hello. You have reached Sally Shaffer. How may I help you? (GIGGLES) Naomi's routine might have made her a target. The hotel says she took the same route in the same taxi every day for five days every month. Philip Shaffer? Also a research scientist at Mellor Biotech. Second husband. First husband died in a car crash. So Sally is... Philip's step daughter. The company Naomi works for, Helding Pharmaceuticals, are mid-ranking, turnover down 45%. Jane Wickham's been complaining about insurance renewal, so... Conrad Victor, a German chemical company, made a move for Helding two months ago. Fended off. There's an inhaler in this video. Do we have any idea whether it's...? No mention of it in Naomi's medical records. Good. Mr King. Jane Wickham. Hello. Please come with me. Thank you. Is it not possible to trace these calls? No. Not without the number or the carrier. Anyway, they will have trashed the phone the minute the made the call. What exactly was Naomi doing in South Africa? Erm...we are building a new factory out there. Our first. It'll specialise in plants in prescription medicines. Like Aspirin? Exactly. Pharmacognosy, which is Naomi's passion. So could the kidnap be related to this work? She's a botanist. How are you gonna get her back? There's a process that... The kidnappers will call again. I would actually like to monitor your phone system. You think they might call me? Unlikely. But you're her employer, so it's certainly possible. And what would I say if they call? You refer them to me - I'll give you my number - and you just activate the recording device the minute they call. Do whatever you have to do. I've known Naomi for ten years. She's... She's become a friend now. Most kidnaps are simple transactions. You give them what they want, within reason, and they should release Naomi. (PHONE RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Mr Dominic! Yes. So did you see that on the screen? I did see it. How is Mrs Shaffer? She wasn't hurt. A bruise maybe. I'd like to speak to her, please, so that I know for sure. She's fine. She's very happy. When are you gonna pay me my money? If you want me to get you what you want, I have to know that she is alive. No! 'Hello?' 'Are you there?' Yes. I'm here. But why would I continue to negotiate with you... ..if she's dead? 'I want $2m.' For a dead body? She's not dead! Prove it. Say something. (GASPS) Say something! 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry.' Good. $2m - that's all I care about! There's no way they can get that kind of money. Don't lie to me. We've seen the pictures. Big house, she's rich. Have you ever been to London? No. How do you know how much the house is worth? White folks, big houses. If you force the family to sell the house to get you the money, that's going to take months and months and months and months. Can you wait that long? We can wait forever! OK. What are you doing? Waiting. Don't mess with me, man. I can get you $50,000. What did you say? $50,000. I can get it to you very quickly. You can have it straight away. 50,000? I'll kill her first! (GUN COCKING) No, wait. You listen to me. You stay very calm. Calm? You insult me. Why don't I kill her and you keep your 50, huh? Do you know what a New Year's resolution is? Of course I do. Good. Well, mine this year was no more amateurs. What are you calling me? No more deals with slum kids. No more grey hairs expended on losers who can't even spell the word 'deal'. I'm not talking about a back door crack deal. I'm a professional. I only deal... ..with professionals. What are you saying to me? I'm saying life's too short. I don't get paid enough. I'm going to bed. What the fuck?! (GASPS) (PHONE RINGING) Hi, Carrie. You can go home now. What was that all about? It's late, I've had a few whiskeys. What? Are you kidding? (LAUGHS) Yeah, I'm joking. He's gonna call back, but not tonight, so... ..I'll talk to you later. When? Er...tomorrow, the day after. Oh, Dom, you've only just got home. What's this stuff Tess is reading? How long? Er...I dunno. Quick. They're amateurs. A couple of days, a week. Have you spoken to her about this? If you're worried, you say something. You're her father. (DOOR SMASHING OPEN) (SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) (SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) Huh? (SHOUTS IN AFRIKAANS) She has seen our faces. She has seen us. (SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) Hi. Hi. You're up early. Mm-hm. Are you OK, Tess? Yeah, I'm fine. Never better. Do you really believe in all that...stuff? All this stuff? Yeah. You've got to have faith, Dad. You know, I'm erm...going. I know. Good luck. It's for your face. I'm sorry. I've got a daughter. She needs me. (SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) (SPEAKS AFRIKAANS) Get out of here. Get out of here. Go! Feel better? Like a whole new woman. What do you want? The South African police are getting antsy about the murdered taxi driver. The British Consulate have been on to me. Keep them out of it. You give them the Skype footage and they'll give it to the police. You've already sent it to them. We only function with their blessing. That's debatable. You were right about Naomi - she is alive. But you're not right about everything. Get out to Cape Town, close the deal. For your sake, too. I can't close the deal if they don't call me. They'll call. Otherwise you wouldn't have risked the 50,000. (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) Good morning, Mr King. That's more like it. That's very polite. Very...professional. Yeah, well, I'm not taking $50,000. What can you offer me now? As it happens, I can double what I offered. I can get you $100,000. '$100,000?' Don't make me angry. Let's change the subject, then. Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about the taxi driver. Yeah, well, that...was an accident. Well, the police are very angry. I told you not to speak to the police! You know, I am here. I'm in Cape Town. What? I've come to see you. I'm ready to give you your money. I can get you $100,000. You have have your money, Mrs Shaffer can return to her family. We all get what we want. 100,000 cash dollars. Tomorrow. You call me with the time and place. Good morning, sir. Morning. Thanks. She worries me, too. Don't get me wrong. We need to talk about this properly. Easy to say when you're on the other side of the world. I know, but... I'll be home... in a few days. (KNOCKING) Hang on a minute. 'Who is it?' 'The police.' 'I've got to go, love.' Dominic King? Inspector Lanning. Right. I'm sure you were about to call me but I thought I'd save you the trouble. How did you know where I...? Yeah. Brisith Consulate - never piss them off. May I? This is nice. A few days ago, we got a lot of questions about a missing woman. A Mrs Shaffer. We looked for her, spent a lot of time, a lot of man hours. We didn't find her. But we did find her taxi driver. Dead. And then the questions stopped. Everything just went quiet. Shall I tell you who didn't go quiet? The taxi driver's wife and his four children. I wish I could help you, Inspector Lanning. Erm...I'm sure you do. (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) Enjoy South Africa, Mr King. This is nice, really. (SALLY CRYING) Oh, Sally! Come here, Sal. It's all right. Mr King. How are you? I'm good, thanks, sir. A package for me? Carrie? (PHONE RINGING) Sit up! Stay still! OK? Open up! 'And when was the last time you didn't bring someone home alive?' Dom! Wait! You can't do this! 'He's dead. You let him die.' 'You took too long with all your talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.' 'Just business.' (SIGHS) Mr King! You got the money?! Yes, I have the money. But I need to see her face...first, please. Thank you. Now give me the money! I'm gonna step back so that you can count the money now, but not until you bring Mrs Shaffer closer towards me, please. Naomi, we're nearly through. (SCREAMS) Naomi! Naomi, come to me! Come to my voice! (GUNSHOTS) Is that the girl? Yes! Is that the girl?! Yes! You're gonna be sorry, sonny! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) You have no idea who's got her. What I want to know, Jane, is what Naomi is worth to your company. You were found with a dead body. Talk all you want. She's dead. You go down that road, nobody wins. PHILIP: Your negotiator stood by while my wife was shot. itfc subtitles
