 Inside No. 9 (2014–…): Season 2, Episode 5 - Nana's Party - full transcript 
 Fastidious Angela prepares for her mother's seventy-ninth birthday party, at which Angela's alcoholic sister Carol will be present, along with Angela's prankster husband Jim and Carol's equally childish other half Pat. Jim has devised a stunt by which he wants Angela to hide under a false cake to surprise Pat but is then surprised himself when it seems as if Angela has overheard Carol's drunken overtures to him and things do not end well for him. Nana, on the other hand, has a lovely day, complete with male stripper.

 I'm just pulling in now. What number was it? Who called it in? Oh, God. Doesn't sound too good, does it? Hope I'm not too late. DOORBELL CHIMES Hello there. Through here, is it? Please! We need help! Please! VACUUM CLEANER WHINES Jim! Jim, have you sorted out the music like I asked you to?

 Something appropriate this time, not the soundtrack to The Mission. I want it to be like a party, not an advert for British Airways. Jim! Useless. Oh, my God! Katie, what HAVE you been doing? What? This mess! It's like a bomb site! Well, it's... it's just a book. You've... you've knocked over all the tassels, are you trying to drive me mad? I've only just tidied up in here. Well, it is tidy! I'm just doing my homework. Well, you'll have to do it upstairs. I can't have it looking like Vietnam! You know it's your nana's party today.

 Where's your father? Is he upstairs? Dunno. What time are they coming? ~ Any minute! ~ SHE SLAMS DRAWER If he's in that deckhouse watching his Countdown videos, I'll kill him. Have you signed your nana's card? No. I made her one with loads of glue and glitter... What?! KATIE LAUGHS Katie, it's not funny. Are you trying to give me a stroke? Oh, 79. I just wish it was the 80th, then we could have it all done. ~ That's nice! ~ Well, you know what I mean. It's a lot of work. Can you go and see if he's in the deckhouse, please, Katie? Do you mean "the shed"? And can you bring me in some of those sausage rolls from the freezer. I DON'T want to be caught short. Right. The plates, napkins, crisps for Carol... No, that's not right. ~ Boo! ~ Oh! Heh-heh! That got you, didn't it?! What the bloody hell are you doing? You'd better not have cut a hole in that table! No, the middle leaf slides out. So! Ah! what do you think? About what? I'm going to be under there when Pat arrives with your mother. You get him to move the cake, he'll get the shock of his life! Why? Oh, come on, Angela. You know what he's like. You were furious when he put clingfilm over the downstairs toilet. Yeah, and what about the time he put wallpaper paste in the birdbath? Oh, don't. I still see that one-legged tit. Exactly. He needs a taste of his own medicine. But not on my mother's birthday! You can do it in your own time. And what are we going to do for a cake, now? Oh! He thinks I haven't got a sense of humour. He's unable to engage with me on an intellectual level, so he has to resort to puerile practical jokes. Well, you've just cut a hole in my second-best table cloth, so I think the joke's on me. What time are they arriving? Any minute. Can you just please... straighten those tassels? They are literally driving me mad. I'm not happy about this, Jim. Pat's got enough on his plate without you turning into Justin Bieber! Who? You know, the little man with the beard, plays tricks on people. Jeremy Beadle? Well, whoever it was... Pat's got the "Carol situation" to think about. What's happening with that now? Is it still bad? It's worse. According to Pat, it's white wine in a coffee mug at 9.30 in the morning, apparently. Mind you, if I were married to Pat, I think I'd be driven to drink... Now, it's important you don't light the candles, Ange. The exterior is all sugar-paste icing, but it's just cardboard underneath. I don't want to end up as Joan of Arc. Don't tell me. I'm not getting involved. Oh, come on, Angela! You're always saying I'm boring, I've got no sense of humour... Oh, do you have to? I'm going to my room. Could you just... try and be nice? Just for my mother's sake? I'm always nice. I just want my revenge. CAR HORN HONKS My God, they're here. I've got one marigold inside out! What am I supposed to do again? Just get Pat to move the cake. And don't let him plug in his mobile phone. All he ever wants to do is steal our electricity. Hello! Happy birthday, Mum. Come in. I need to spend a penny first. Is it this one? Yeah... And you've no need to lock it this time, Mum. LOCK CLICKS We'll never get her out now. Hiya, Carol. Hiya, love. You all right? Well, this is nice. Oh, catalogue. Don't tell Pat. ~ I heard that, pardon. ~ Hiya, Pat. I used to be a werewolf, but I'm all right nooooowwww! Do you need a hand with anything? No, I've only got the one bag, you've met my wife Carol. Take that mask off, you daft sod. You take yours off first. ~ Thanking you. ~ Thank you! ~ Right, please go through. ~ Ooh! Heh. ~ Aw, you've got it lovely, Ange. ~ Ooh! Ha-ha! ~ Take your shoes off! ~ Why? Do you remember last time, when you shuffled all that muck in? She went mad. Well, it's their own fault. Who has a white carpet now, except for Elton John? Right, make yourselves at home. Sorry, I've told him to take his shoes off. Oh, there's no need. Although I might just, er, straighten the... There... Right, what can I get you to drink? Er, she'll have a tea, won't you? I can answer for myself! Yeah, I'll have tea. And you've got your own, Pat? Yes, I'll pop them in the fridge, if I may? Ooh! Where's Jimbo? Oh, he's around somewhere. Deckhouse, probably. Oh! Countdown omnibus? ~ Who knows? ~ SHE FILLS KETTLE Right, well, we'll just wait for Mother to come out of the loo and then we'll do the cake, all right? Oh, well, let her get settled first, eh? Is Katie not here? No, no, she's up in her room doing her homework. We hardly see her since we got her that tablet. Oh, did you hear that, Pat? They got her a tablet. Mmm. Bit young to be on the pill, isn't she? It's a computer device. No, he... He knows what it is. Right! It's not flushed. I can't make it flush. Well, you push it. I showed you last time. I did push it, nothing happened. It's all right, Mum, I'll do it. Here, take this. Oh! Don't be horrible! At least you didn't put that tinfoil over it again! Clingfilm! Did your pedestal mat come out all right, Angela? We disposed of it, it's fine. Come through, Mother. SHE TAKES DEEP BREATHS You still on that diet, Pat? Yes, I'm on a seafood diet. ~ If I see food, I eat it! ~ HE LAUGHS Well, there's plenty of salady stuff, anyway. Oh, Angela, read this card that he got for me, it's a scream! You mind if I charge my phone for an hour, Ange? ~ Running a bit low. ~ No, of course not. Down here, is it? Oh, no, no, just a minute. I'll put it in up here, Pat. "Forget about the past, you can't change it. "Forget about the future, you can't predict it. "Forget about the present, I didn't get you one." SHE LAUGHS Isn't that a scream? Courtesy of Mr H Allmark! Did you hear it, Angela? Yes, Mother, it's... very funny. Well, shall we move this cake and make some room, Pat? Could you? Wait a minute, I want to take a picture of the spread. I told your cousin Ann I'd show it to her. Now, where's me camera? Pat, have you seen my camera? It's in the car, Maggie, I'll be back in two shakes. Don't be long! Whoo! Ahh. You used too much paper, Mum. It's all right, it's gone now. Oh, thanks Carol, love. Come and have a look at our Angela's spread. She's done a prawn ring. Aw, yeah. You can get them quite cheap now, can't you? It's all Marks's, actually. Apart from the ham, which I got from the local batchers. From the what? From the batchers. The "batchers"? What's the "batchers"? Leave her alone. I like her talking posh. It's not posh, Mother, it's proper! Oh, heh! We're not "proper", Mum! I wanted BOTH my girls to talk nice! That's why I sent you for electrocution lessons. You should say "batcher", Carol. That's how you get on! Oh, right. So what are we having for afters, "sammer padding"? Well, I did make a trifle, but it's got quite a bit of sherry in it, so... ~ KETTLE CLICKS ~ Kettle's boiled. (Go on!) I'll give you a hand. Marks's is dear, though, isn't it, Angela? They sell carrots peeled. FARTING SOUND Get down! ~ Ahem! ~ JIM: Oh, Jesus Christ! PAT SIGHS Here we go, Maggie May. You ready for your close-up? Oh, yeah, go on. Get the spread in! Oof, that meat's off. No, it's fresh from the "batchers". Right, hang on a minute, Mam, let me get them candles lit. ~ No! ~ Eh? No, don't... don't do it yet. Jim'll want to see it. Oh, he won't mind. You can always light them again. Mm, there's a special setting on here for candles. Come on, then, everyone bunch in! I want both my daughters. Three generations. Ooh, where's your Katie? She's upstairs doing her homework. Just take it, Pat. They've got her a tablet. ~ A what? ~ A computer. She's 14. Oh, Angela, they don't need computers at 14! They do if they want to get into St Catherine's. Just take it, Pat. Right, then, say, "Cheesy Wotsits!" Cheesy Wotsits! Hi, Nana! Happy birthday! Aw! Katie, you're here! Just get in this and then I'll have all my girls. ~ Hiya, darling! ~ Hi, Auntie Carol. Hi, Uncle Pat. Bloody hell, who's this? You've shot up, haven't you? Proper little madam. Come on, then! Let's get this photo taken. Three generations. Just let me refocus... Oh... Come on, David Bailey, hurry up! One, two, three... ~ Wait! ~ What? I didn't show Katie the card. Oh, show her after, Mum! No, I want to show her now. Listen to this, Katie. "Forget about the past, you can't change it." Can we just... "Forget about the future, you can't predict it." Mother, you can do that in a minute! "Forget about the present, I didn't get you one." NAN LAUGHS CAROL: Tickled you that, hasn't it? Oh, it has! And I don't know where he gets them from. ~ Mr H Allmark. ~ Well, it's funny, Nana. Can you just blow the bloody candles out?! Oh, hang on! I have to make my wish. ~ Hey! ~ Mum! It's Nana's cake! She took my wish! Pat, could you move the cake now, please? ~ CAMERA BLEEPS ~ Ah, no, battery's ran out. I'll just nip and get the charger from the car. You don't mind, do you, Ange? ~ No, you can plug it in next to your mobile. ~ Thanking you! Well, erm, I've got to get on with my homework now, Nana, so... Right, well, er, I'll just nip to the loo, top myself up. Where's my bag? La-la-la... Katie, tell me about this tablet. Is it a computer? I have 23 tablets a day, imagine that! Well, that went well, didn't it? Is this all of it? Mm, it's thin. Is it magnetic? You know, I bought your mum one of these. You had to drag iron filings onto a man's face and make little beards and funny hair. Can yours do that? ~ I don't know. ~ Hers did. There's nothing new. Heh, well, you can play games on it as well, Nana, look. Oh, lovely colours! Hello, is this the Princess Palace? Oh, no! You've taken them all down! Oh, you used to have all the princesses, didn't you?! Oh, Snow White, Cinderella, the Chinese one, what was she called now, not Chinkerbell... Auntie Carol! You can't say that. Yeah, I know, cos she wasn't a proper princess, she was a fairy! I've always thought it. They try and bundle them all together. It's a rip-off. ~ So... Party in your room, is it? ~ Yeah, well, erm... ~ Eh? Heh-heh! ..I've got to get on with my homework. Eh? Oh, there's time for work, Katie. It's your nana's birthday! I'm building a path on my island. I don't know why! You know your problem? You're like your dad. Too much in your head. Oh, there's a whole world out there, Katie! Just...just have fun, because it goes by so fast. Will you let me do your nails, please? I've just got to get on with my maths. Oh, I'll tell you "maths", shall I? One takes away from one, and you're left with nothing. Do you think I'd make a good mum, Katie? Be honest. Yeah. Correct! Mmmm. CAROL SIGHS DRUNKENLY Right, I'm going toilet. SHE GROANS Ah. Hey, have I shown you this? This is my block. "Apply liberally for 24-hour protection." SHE SNIGGERS You won't get that. I do. Just have fun. SHE SIGHS Now, how do I get back to main menu, Katie? I want to attack that village! I think just leave it now, Jim. It didn't work. It's too late. It's not too late. You get under there and I'll get him to move the cake. ~ I'm not doing it! ~ Come on, he'll be back soon. ~ Oh, Jim, is it worth it? ~ Yes! It's just a laugh, OK? Now, get under the table. Make it quick! I've got 24 sausage rolls to warm through. HE CHUCKLES Here he is, the man himself! How are you, Jimbo? I'm all right, thanks, Pat. Angela's just nipped out to get some more candles. I didn't see her. She didn't come past me. No, she went out the back and through the gardens. It's slightly quicker. How is Angela these days? I thought she looked a bit tired. You know, a little bit puffy-eyed and pale. She's all right. You know what she's like. She's always got some project on the go. Yes. I just wish Carol was like that. Mm. How is Carol these days? Fine, fine. Just need to get her a little job. ~ She's ready now. ~ Good. Good. Do you want to give me a hand moving this cake, Pat? ~ I just want to make some more room. ~ Righty-ho. Oh, before I forget, I've got that Countdown video you lent me. ~ Don't worry about it. ~ No, no, I'm sure you'll want it back. I'll just pop and get it. Jim? What's going on? Nothing, he's just... He'll be back soon. Where's he going? I'm starting to get a stiff neck! All right. Well, maybe we should leave it, then. Do you want to...? Here we go. Yes, quite a decent episode, I thought. ~ A lot happens. ~ I can't remember, to be honest. Well, there are three scenarios. The first one involves a blonde lady taking, shall we say, ~ two from the top and one in the bottom... ~ Pat! Let me get you a drink. You must be thirsty after that long drive. Have they still got those roadworks up at Long Croft? No, they've moved onto Ash Lane now. There's temporary traffic lights, but unless you're doing the school run, it's not too bad. Mm. So did you forgo the pleasures of the A352? Yes, I tend to take that cut-through on Meadowbank now. ~ It's always quieter. ~ Ah, good. Good. So, about this cake... If you could give me a hand, it is quite heavy. Don't be leaving this lying around, Jim. Wouldn't want Katie putting it on by accident. No, I'll, er... I'll just put it somewhere safe. You see, I'm like you, Jim - I can't watch hard-core pornography on a computer. Give me an old-fashioned video cassette any day of the week. Oh. Well, good for you. Yeah, I particularly enjoyed this week's conundrum. I might be returning to have another go at that one, if you don't mind. Don't know what you mean. Charlie's Anals, starring Farrah Forced-It, Katy Jacked-Off and Jaclyn Clit. ~ Where do they come up with these names, I ask you?! ~ Well, I, er... Oh, God. What are you two talking about? Is he boring you, Jim? No, we were just, er, discussing an episode of Countdown. Oh, weary. Oh, let's get some music on, get some life into this house! ~ Where's our Angela? ~ Oh, she just nipped out to get some more candles. It's a bit cold outside for sun cream, isn't it, Carol? Let me get you a nice refreshing glass of Adam's Ale. Piss off and leave me alone, you fat pig. As you wish. Oh, God, what the hell is this terrible music? It's Ennio Morricone, Carol. The Mission. Ooh, my favourite position. Mmmm. Your Katie's got a nice room, hasn't she? Yes, she picked it all out herself. She knows her own taste. She's got a better bedroom than me. That's ironical, isn't it? Who sang that? ♪ It's ironical... ♪ I don't know. She's got a lovely big bed. Maybe we could christen it one afternoon? That'd be nice, wouldn't it? Come on, my angel, have a few sips on this. ~ Come on, Jim, dance with me! ~ No! No, I think perhaps I should go and put the sausage rolls in the oven. Yeah, I wish you would. ~ Come on, Carol. ~ SHE SIGHS Drop dead. I'll just, erm... go and fetch a towel. ~ I want to tell him, Jim. ~ What?! I want to tell Pat and whatsit... Angela. Carol, shush! Why are you saying all this? Because you've made promises to me over the years! ~ Years? What are you talking...?! ~ No, I want them told today. It's humiliating for me to have to come round here and see all what she's got. Why are you still with her, Jim? You told me you couldn't stand the sight of her. ~ No, that's not true, Ange. ~ Oh, I want this to be my house. I want this spread to be my spread. I want you to put your sausage rolls in my oven - fan assisted. Please discard all packaging, turn over after 15 minutes when the juices run clear... or is that a chicken? Stop it! I waited for you, Jim. ~ You promised me a baby. ~ Carol, stop it! Katie, do you want to know what your sister's name was going to be? Don't listen to her, she's drunk! I love you. Oh, you'll have to get one of these for my 80th! ~ Hello, Jim, love. Are you all right? ~ Yes. Happy birthday, Maggie. Hello, Katie. ~ Aw, here she is. Katie, come and dance with me. ~ MUSIC PLAYS Where's Angela? I want to show her that I built a settlement. Oh, she won't be long. She's just running an errand. It's got pigs and everything. I think I'd like a drink now, Jim. ~ Can I have a gin and tonic, please? ~ Yes, right. Do you want ice? ~ Yes, but don't be putting willies in it. ~ What? Pat has these ice cubes at his house in the shape of willies. You fill the tray with water, put it in the freezer, and out comes 24 little ice willies. It's comical. Isn't it, Carol? I'm just telling Jim about Pat's willies. I wouldn't know, I haven't seen it in years. He keeps it hid. I'll have a Jim and tonic if you're making one, Gin. ~ Do you want one, Katie? ~ Erm... ~ No, I've got to finish my maths. ~ Oh, Katie, live! Live while you're still young! Don't let it pass you by. MUSIC STOPS Here you go, Maggie. Thank you. ~ Come on, Carol - I think you should go and have a lie down. ~ Aw! ~ SHE GIGGLES ~ Did you hear that, Katie? Your dad's trying to get me into bed. What do you think about that? ~ Right, that's enough! ~ Don't you touch me! ~ I'm bonding with Katie. If I'm going to be her stepmum... ~ What?! For God's sake, Carol, shut your mouth! Don't talk to her like that, Jim. Come on, Carol, love. Oh, you've ruined my make-up now. SHE SOBS I don't know why I bothered! I don't know what's got into her. It's all right, Jim, it's all under control. ~ She just started ranting and raving... ~ Jim. I know. All right? I know. Know what? What's he talking about? Where's Mum? ~ She just... ~ Right, everyone, I am making my wish. ~ No! ~ I want a tablet! Angela! What? I nip out for five minutes, all hell breaks loose. Oh, thank God. I'm sorry I spoilt your trick, Jim, I just couldn't stay under there any longer. My knees were killing me. Oh, it's all right. It was a stupid idea anyway. I went and got Mum a proper cake. I nipped out when you and Pat were in the kitchen. Ah, so you missed all the drama, then? ~ Why, what's been happening? ~ Oh, nothing. Just your sister acting up again. ~ Mum? ~ Mm? ~ I really need to speak to you. Why, what's going on? ~ COUGHING ~ Nana? ~ She's choking! ~ Mother, what...? What have you given her?! Gin and tonic! ~ SHE COUGHS AND CHOKES ~ It's the ice! If she's choking on one of your willies...! Come on, Mother. It's spiders. I put spiders in them, look! Bloody idiot! Call an ambulance! ~ Nana? ~ Katie, your Auntie Carol's a little bit drunk. ~ Don't pay her any mind. ~ What? ~ Where's my phone? Where's my phone?! ~ Patrick! What have you done with this bloody soap? ~ SHE SHRIEKS ~ Oh! Please, Katie, your mother wouldn't understand. Come on, Mother, cough it up! ~ DOORBELL RINGS ~ That'll be the ambulance. ~ Go on, Katie, let them in. ~ We didn't call an ambulance... You all right? Don't leave me. Don't you leave me. Please! We need help! Please! Right, which one of you's Maggie? ~ Here. ~ SHE COUGHS Right, stand back, everyone. MUSIC: Casualty theme tune Pat! Is this you? Happy birthday, Maggie. Oh, well, what a day. I don't know what you're going to do for my 80th! Yes. We'll have to see. I'm going to keep this spider. My lucky charm. Where did our Angela get to? She's upstairs with Katie. I don't know what they're talking about. Do you think Pat'll be all right? Yeah. He's got Carol to look after him. Yeah. They're a grand couple, aren't they? Nice of him to have booked that lad for me. He said he wasn't going to get me a present. Oh, that reminds me. I didn't read his card to you, did I? Listen to this. "Forget about the past, you can't change it. "Forget about the future, you can't predict it. "Forget about the present, "I didn't get you one." Isn't that a scream?
