 FROM THE LEGENDARY  SNAKE ISLAND... [ SNAKES HISSING ] ...INTO ONE OF THE MOST  DANGEROUS JUNGLES IN THE WORLD TO TRACK DOWN THE MASSIVE  TREASURE OF THE TRINITY. PREVIOUSLY  ON "TREASURE QUEST"... Emilio:  WELCOME TO SANTA ANA, EH? Brett:  YEAH, THIS IS AWESOME. Cork: I SAW A BAR  BACK AT THE BLACK MARKET. THIS IS WHERE  THEY GOT IT FROM. AS FAR AS WE KNOW,  WE COULD BE STANDING ON A PILE. SANTA ANA, GIVE UP  YOUR SECRETS, MAN. Emilio: GUYS, GUYS,  LOOK AT THIS. Jeremy: WHAT DO YOU GOT? Brett: A STONE WALL  OF SOME KIND. THERE IS NOTHING  SUPPOSED TO BE OUT HERE. THIS WAS A CHAMBER. Mehgan:  BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD HUNDREDS  OF MILLIONS WORTH IN INGOTS. MEHGAN, LOOK.  WHOA. Cork:  THAT'S A REAL MARKING. THAT'S A JESUIT  TREASURE MAP, MAN. THEY WOULD ONLY  LEAVE THE CARVING IF THEY MOVED  THE TREASURE. Mehgan:  WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT  DIRECTION IT'S POINTING US IN. Brett: WE HAVE TO LOOK  FOR A CAVE OR CAVERN. IT WAS SUPPOSED  TO BE AROUND HERE. BIG DROP-OFF. Jeremy:  THAT'S A WATERFALL, ALL RIGHT.  WE'RE ON THE WRONG END OF IT. Cork:  WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RAPPEL. Brett: ALL RIGHT.  ROCK AND ROLL. Mehgan: CAREFUL. Jeremy:  HE'S OFF THE LINE. BRETT, BRETT,  BRETT, COME IN. BRETT, COME IN. BRETT, BRETT, BRETT,  CAN YOU READ ME? BRETT, BRETT,  BRETT, COME IN. Mehgan: I DON'T SEE HIM. Jeremy: CAN YOU READ ME? [ RADIO STATIC ] OH, MAN. [ ALL SIGH ] Jeremy: TREASURE HUNTING  IS DANGEROUS. YOU RISK YOUR LIFE,  BUT THAT'S PART OF THE GAME. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE NEED TO RAPPEL  DOWN THIS WATERFALL BECAUSE THE JESUIT MARKER  WE FOUND HAD DIRECTIONS TO A CAVE THAT WE THINK  IS HOLDING THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY. Narrator: THE TREASURE HUNTERS  ARE FOLLOWING THE CRYPTIC DIRECTIONS  CARVED ON THE JESUIT MARKER THAT THEY FOUND  IN THE JUNGLES SURROUNDING THE SANTA ANA MISSION  IN ARGENTINA. ACCORDING  TO THE TEAM'S CALCULATIONS, THE MARKER POINTS TO A CAVE LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM  OF THIS WATERFALL. THAT MIGHT BE THE RESTING PLACE OF THE LEGENDARY TREASURE OF THE TRINITY. Mehgan: THAT'S SO COOL! Brett: [ Laughing ] YEAH! Jeremy:  IT'S BEEN A LONG DRY SPELL  SINCE WE TRACKED DOWN THAT SILVA BAR IN TRINIDAD. SO I CAN'T WAIT  TO GET DOWN THERE AND GET MY HANDS ON SOME GOLD. Mehgan: LOOK AT THAT! EMILIO! ALL RIGHT, AMIGO.  YOU CAN DO IT. ALL RIGHT, LET A LITTLE BIT OUT  ON YOUR RIGHT HAND. THERE YOU GO. FIRST TIME I'M DOING THIS,  AND I'M -- YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD VERTIGO  SINCE I CAN REMEMBER. I DON'T KNOW. AT THAT POINT, I SAID,  "OKAY, EMILIO, LET ME JUST TIE A LINE ON YOU AND I WILL LOWER YOU DOWN  RIGHT NOW." I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING?  NOTHING. OKAY. I'VE HAD A LOT OF SITUATIONS  WHERE I'M RIGHT ON THE EDGE. I RESPECT FEAR.  FEAR KEEPS US ALIVE. SO, IT WAS UP TO ME,  AT THIS POINT, TO TRY TO MAKE HIM  GET PAST THESE FEARS WHERE HE CAN GET HIM  ON THE BOTTOM. EMILIO! COME ON DOWN! PUT YOUR FEET OUT  IN FRONT OF YOU! Emilio: YEAH, YEAH. LEAN BACK. YOU'RE DOING  GOOD, BUD. LEAN BACK, BUDDY. LEAN BACK. YOU GOT IT, MAN!  YOU GOT IT, BUDDY! Mehgan: ALL RIGHT,  YOU'RE ALMOST THERE. Brett: YOU'RE GOOD.  YOU'RE GOOD TO STAND. HIGH FIVE, MAN. YOU ALL RIGHT?  YOU GOOD? [ LAUGHTER ] Mehgan: ALL RIGHT, CAP. CAPPY, I WANT TO BE YOU  WHEN I GROW UP. [ LAUGHTER ] GET OVER HERE.  GET OVER HERE. Mehgan:  WHAT DO YOU GOT? Jeremy: IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S  A WHOLE NETWORK OF CAVES GOING BACK IN THERE. LOOK AT THIS, MAN. PROBABLY RUNS ALL THE WAY  INTO THE MOUNTAIN, DUDE. IT'S ALL SPELUNKING, MAN. YOU KNOW,  THIS COULD BE IT. Narrator:  JEREMY HAS FOUND A CAVE  THAT MATCHES THE DESTINATION DEPICTED ON THE MARKER FOUND  ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE SANTA ANA MISSION. AS HINTED BY THAT MARKER, THIS CAVE LIES  TWO AND A HALF MILES FROM THE OROLIO SANTA ANA,  IN A LOCATION SO REMOTE, IT WOULD'VE BEEN  A LOGICAL PLACE TO HIDE AN ANCIENT HOARD  OF SILVER AND GOLD WORTH AROUND $400 MILLION. THE RESEARCH AND THE DRAWINGS, IT ALL COMES TOGETHER. LET'S GET  TO WORK, MAN. I'LL GO IN AS FAR  AS I THINK'S SAFE AND KIND OF SEE  WHERE IT GOES. ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT CAVES  THAT'S PROBABLY MOST DANGEROUS IS CAVE-INS. LOOSE ROCK UP ON THE CEILING,  YOU KNOW, MIGHT JUST BE WAITING JUST FOR THAT ONE  PERFECT LITTLE VIBRATION. PICK YOUR POISON --  THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG. Cork:  I'M JUST GOING SLOW, MAN. [ GRUNTING ] THERE'S SPIDERS  AND BATS AND FROGS. ACTUALLY, THERE'S  A BUNCH OF TOADS STUCK UP  ON THE WALL IN HERE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YEAH. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD -- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD  AND CRAWL UP INTO THE SYSTEM AND SEE WHERE IT GOES. [ WINGS FLAPPING ]  BAT! [BLEEP] ANOTHER [BLEEP]ING BAT.  OHH! WE GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS.  AAH! OH, [BLEEP]  THERE'S A BAT. AAH! AAH! Mehgan: HIT ME  RIGHT IN THE HEAD. IT IS, LIKE, YOU KNOW,  PART OF THE JOB. THOSE ARE HUGE. Emilio: VAMPIRE BAT --  THEY COULD GIVE YOU RABIES. WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL  ABOUT THIS PLACE. HEY, I'M GONNA GO ALL THE WAY  TO THE BACK OF THE CAVE AND THEN DETECT  MY WAY OUT. BE CAREFUL. WE DON'T WANT NO CAVE-INS, DUDE. I GOT A HIT, MAN.  I GOT A HIT, CAPPY. Keith: OH, YOU DID?  YEP. YEP, HERE IT IS. WE GOT TWO BRONZE NAILS  BACK HERE. SOMEBODY WAS BACK HERE. YEAH. DEFINITELY. HEY, CAP?  YEAH? I GOT A COUPLE BOARDS  DOWN HERE, MAN. THEY LOOK PRETTY OLD. LOOK AT IT. THAT'S PART OF A BARREL.  SEE THE CURVE ON IT? HEY, I GOT ANOTHER PIECE  RIGHT HERE, DUDE. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE  ALL THIS STUFF OUT OF HERE? I'M GONNA SEARCH ALL THE WAY UP  TO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE, SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND. OHH. IT'S ALMOST LIKE  A MAZE IN HERE. WHOA! MORE BATS. I DON'T SEE ANY CARVINGS  OR ANYTHING. [ DETECTOR BEEPING ] GOT A HIT.  YOU'RE A HIT. [ BEEPING CONTINUES ] DUDE. THESE GUYS ARE NOT  GONNA BELIEVE THIS. JEREMY? Jeremy: HEY, YOU GUYS.  THERE HE IS. HEY. HERE,  HAND ME THE CAMERA. YOU ALL RIGHT?  YEAH, I'M FINE. GOT IT. HEY, CORK? PUT YOUR HAND OUT. A COIN? OH, WOW. MAN, THIS IS AWESOME. IS IT A MODERN COIN  OR AN OLD COIN? IT'S 18-SOMETHING. I CAN'T READ THE LAST NUMBER 'CAUSE I DON'T  HAVE MY GLASSES. 1870. '70 -- THAT WAS THE END  OF THE WAR. Cork: THIS IS  THE WAR OF THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE. PARAGUAY.  PARAGUAY. WE'RE IN ARGENTINA.  THIS WAS PARAGUAY. BUT AFTER THE END OF THAT WAR,  IT WAS ARGENTINA. THERE WERE A LOT  OF PEOPLE WHO DIED. I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING THAT PARAGUAY'S STILL A COUNTRY. Narrator:  THE WAR OF THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE  WAS THE BLOODIEST CONFLICT IN LATIN-AMERICAN HISTORY. BETWEEN 1864 AND 1870, PARAGUAY CLASHED  WITH THE ALLIANCE OF URUGUAY, BRAZIL,  AND ARGENTINA. IT EVENTUALLY SUFFERED  A DEVASTATING DEFEAT, LOSING 70%  OF ITS MALE POPULATION AND ALMOST A QUARTER  OF ITS TERRITORY. YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY BAFFLES ME IS THE FACT THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE  OF NOWHERE. YEAH. BUT IF YOU'RE TRYING  TO HIDE OUT FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING  TO KILL YOU... THAT MAKES SENSE. THE COIN -- IT'S NOT TIED  TO THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY, BUT JUST TO HAVE CONNECTED  WITH A PART OF THIS HISTORY IN THIS AREA IS REALLY COOL. AND THERE'S STILL MORE CAVERNS  TO BE EXPLORED IN THERE. WELL, IT'S STARTING  TO GET LATE, YEAH. STARTING TO GET DARK, HERE. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? Mehgan: WE GOT TO SET UP CAMP, MAN. ALL RIGHT.  LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT. I'LL HIT IT FIRST THING. Mehgan: MAN, ALL MY STUFF GOT  WET GOING OVER THAT WATERFALL. OH, REALLY?  YEAH. Brett: I WAS WALKING ON THOSE  ROCKS AND SLIPPED, AND I CUT MYSELF  WITH A MACHETE A LITTLE BIT. IF YOU DON'T STAY  ON TOP OF THESE CUTS, THERE'S SO MUCH BACTERIA. THINGS GET INFECTED LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'D EXTRACT  SOMEBODY RIGHT HERE. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY. WE'RE SO DEEP INTO THE JUNGLE AND EVERYBODY'S  KIND OF EXHAUSTED. WE'RE READY TO FIND SOMETHING,  YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TANGIBLE. 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,  IT'S ALL THEORIES, IT'S ALL... MAYBES. LET'S GET TEAMS GOING  SO WE CAN GET OUT IN THE FIELD. JEREMY, YOU AND I  AND CAPPY'LL LOOK AT THAT CAVE, AND BRETT AND EMILIO AND MEHGAN WILL GO FURTHER INTO THE JUNGLE. THERE'S POSSIBILITY,  WITH THIS CAVE SYSTEM HERE, THERE COULD BE OTHER ONES  FURTHER DOWN A LITTLE BIT, TOO. YEAH, DEFINITELY BRING  METAL DETECTORS. ALL RIGHT,  LET'S GET TO WORK. Jeremy: SO, I'M GONNA  START SPELUNKING. THERE'S SOME LITTLE ROOMS,  CAVERNS, AND STUFF INSIDE THERE I WANT TO DETECT. YOU GUYS WANT TO CHECK OUT  ALL THE HOLES UP ON THE RIDGE? THERE'S, LIKE,  TWO RIDGES RIGHT THERE WITH A BUNCH OF POCKETS. OKAY. BE CAREFUL  WITH THOSE BATS. OHH, THERE HE IS.  I CAN FEEL THEM IN HERE. [BLEEP] IT. I LOVE CAVES. [ DETECTOR BEEPING ] Cork:  BE CAREFUL UP THERE. THAT'S  PRETTY HAIRY, RIGHT THERE. YOU GOT A GOOD HOLD? NOPE. [ GRUNTS ] WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? ALMOST LIKE AN ANIMAL'S  BEEN UP IN HERE. CAN YOU TELL  WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL? I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT. BUT I CAN SMELL  THERE'S SOMETHING HERE. [ MONKEYS HOWLING ] Mehgan: LET'S SPREAD OUT  RIGHT HERE, Y'ALL. Emilio: OKAY. THESE JUNGLES, EVERY METER YOU WALK, IT JUST LOOKS THE SAME AS THE METER THAT YOU HAVE  JUST WALKED BEFORE. IT CAN MAKE YOU CRAZY,  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT DOES.  IT'S SO THICK -- WHICH WAY'S LEFT AND RIGHT  AND UP AND DOWN? Mehgan:  OH. HEY, EMILIO, BRETT. YEAH?  WE GOT A KILL OVER HERE. IT'S STILL WARM. OH, MAN. WHAT KILLED THIS?  CAN YOU TELL? SEE THAT?  THE BASE OF THE SKULL THERE. YEAH.  THE SKULL, CLAWS HERE. YEAH.  FANGS GO THROUGH. IT WAS A BIG CAT,  FOR SURE. Emilio:  THE WAY IT JUST STARTED TO FEED  ON THIS FROM THE CHEST -- GOING BACKWARDS, MOVING OUT,  YOU KNOW, THEN DISTENDS  FROM THE STOMACHS. IT'S DEFINITELY A JAGUAR.  IT'S GOT TO BE NEARBY. NOTHING. WE NEED TO LEAVE  THIS PLACE RIGHT AWAY. THIS WAY. THERE'S GOT TO BE  SOMETHING IN HERE. MAN, THERE'S HUGE POCKETS  OF CRYSTALS IN THIS CAVE. I GOT AMETHYST AND QUARTZ -- NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR,  BUT KIND OF COOL. [ DETECTOR BEEPING ] YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING  THAT SCREAMS "JESUIT" TO ME. GEEZ! NOTHING ELSE, MAN. THIS IS THE CAVE  NEXT TO A WATERFALL, BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I THINK WE'RE  IN THE WRONG SPOT. Jeremy: THIS PILL IS BECOMING  INCREASINGLY HARD TO SWALLOW. IT'S LIKE SNAKE ISLAND  ALL OVER AGAIN. WE FOUND THE REMNANTS  OF A LOCKBOX IN A CAVE THERE. CORK, IT'S FRICKING GONE, MAN. THE MOTHER LODE  ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE JUST OUT OF OUR GRASP. OUR BEST HOPE NOW IS,  IRONICALLY, WE'VE MISINTERPRETED  THE JESUIT MARKER FOUND OUTSIDE SANTA ANA. MAYBE THE END POINT  WASN'T MEANT TO BE A CAVE, BUT SOME OTHER LANDMARK. SO NOW WE HAVE TO COMB  THIS JUNGLE FOR A DIFFERENT, DISTINCTIVE LAND FEATURE. LET'S GO MEET UP WITH BRETT  AND MEHGAN AND EMILIO. LET'S GET THE HELL  OUT OF HERE. [ ANIMAL GROWLING ] SHH! Mehgan: OH, MY. OHH. OH, MY GOD. WHAT IS THAT? [ GROWLING CONTINUES ] BACK, BACK, BACK, BACK! [ JAGUAR GROWLS ] WHAT?! Emilio: THE JAGUAR, THE JAGUAR, I SAW IT. I THINK IT'S MOVING.  IT'S MOVING. THIS THING COMES CHARGING UP,  WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT,  WE GOT ONE SHOT LEFT. Mehgan:  COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. JUST PRAY THIS THING WORKS. AAH!  WHOA! WOW.  THAT HAD TO SCARE IT OFF. YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.  DEFINITELY. THEY DON'T LIKE BIG NOISES,  STRONG NOISES. Mehgan: HE WOULDN'T, LIKE,  COME BACK AROUND AND, LIKE, TRACK US  FROM BEHIND, RIGHT? NO. NO. NO, THAT BANG  SHOULD'VE SCARED HIM OFF. DID YOU SEE  WHICH WAY IT WENT? I THINK IT WENT OFF THAT WAY. SO, WHEN WE WALK,  IT MAY NOT BE A BAD IDEA TO MAKE  A LITTLE BIT MORE NOISE. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT, ALL RIGHT? DEFINITELY. WE'LL HEAD STRAIGHT EAST,  ALL RIGHT? SOUNDS GOOD. YEAH. WHAT IS THAT? A ROCK WALL RIGHT HERE, GUYS.  SEE THAT? WOW. EMILIO, WHAT IS THIS? I HAVE NO IDEA, MAN. HERE, WE GOT TO RADIO THOSE GUYS. HEY. WE JUST STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE OUT HERE. YOU GOT TO GET OVER TO OUR POSITION STRAIGHTAWAY. Emilio: IT'S JUST AMAZING. Brett: A ROCK WALL  RIGHT HERE, GUYS. WHOA. WHAT IS THIS?  I HAVE NO IDEA. LOOK, IT GOES ON AND ON! Brett: OH, MY GOD. HEY. WE JUST STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE OUT HERE. YOU GOT TO GET OVER TO OUR POSITION STRAIGHTAWAY. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS, GUYS,  I MEAN, THIS IS... IT'S THE EXACT STONE THAT WAS  AT THE SANTA ANA MISSION. LIKE,  THE EXACT SAME STONE. THERE'S NOTHING ON THE MAP IN THIS AREA THAT YOU KNOW OF? Emilio: NO. CAN YOU GUYS HELP ME CLEAN IT OFF A LITTLE BIT? Man: MEHGAN! OVER HERE! Emilio: GUYS. LOOK -- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,  ON, ON, ON. Brett: WE HAVEN'T EVEN  SEEN HOW MANY. LIKE, IT JUST KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND GOING. WE SAW A JAGUAR. Jeremy: REALLY?  ARE YOU SERIOUS? YEAH. AND THEN, WE WERE WALKING UP,  JUST TO MAKE SURE IT WAS GONE, AND WE SAW THIS. Mehgan: WHAT IS THIS PLACE? ARE THERE ANY KNOWN  OUTPOSTS OR REDUCTIONS OR ANYTHING BUILT  BY THE JESUITS IN THIS AREA? Jeremy: WE GOT NO INFORMATION  ON THIS SITE. THERE'S NOTHING. IT'S LIKE AN OLD COMPOUND  OR SOMETHING. Keith: IF IT'S JESUIT  AND IT'S NOT ON ANY MAPS, WE'RE REWRITING HISTORY  RIGHT NOW. Brett: HEY, CORK. Cork: UH-HUH? DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE  THAT THE MARKER THAT WE FOUND AT SANTA ANA  WAS ACTUALLY LEADING US HERE INSTEAD OF THE CAVE? WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE. THE JESUIT SYMBOLS ARE JUST SO HARD TO DECIPHER. BIG MARGIN OF ERROR.  THOSE BARS MEAN DISTANCE. SO THERE'S A BIT  OF A MARGIN OF ERROR. WE'RE IN THE GENERAL AREA  OF THE MARKER, RIGHT? IT'S PRETTY  SPREAD OUT, SO... YEAH, THAT'S A LARGE AREA. Jeremy: SMACK-DAB IN THE MIDDLE  OF THIS UNCHARTED JUNGLE IS A SERIES OF ROCK WALLS THAT FORM THE BOUNDARY  OF A COMPOUND, PROBABLY ABOUT 15 ACRES IN ALL. NO MENTION OF THIS SITE  IN ANY HISTORICAL RECORDS. I MEAN, THIS IS A REAL PUZZLE. INSTEAD OF THE CAVE, COULD THIS SITE REPRESENT  THE LARGE CIRCLE THAT WAS ENGRAVED  IN THE VARAS MARKER FOUND OUTSIDE OF SANTA ANA? LET'S START SETTING UP  THE SITE GRID AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND HERE. LET'S DO 'ER. Brett: JUST WALL AFTER WALL. DO YOU WANT TO START  RIGHT HERE? Narrator: THE TEAM WILL FIRST  MAP OUT THE BOUNDARIES OF THE MYSTERIOUS COMPOUND AND GRID THE AREA  INTO SECTIONS. Keith:  WE'LL DO A SIX-METER GRID.  WE'LL EXPAND OUT FROM THERE. Narrator:  THEY'LL INVESTIGATE EACH ONE  WITH GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR AND METAL DETECTORS AND ALSO SCOUR  THE CRUMBLING STRUCTURES FOR TREASURE OR JESUIT MARKERS. Keith:  HEY, MEG, LOOK AT THESE. Mehgan:  WHAT DO YOU GOT? COULD THIS BE  SOME KIND OF CARVING? INTERESTING. THIS IS NOT MAN-MADE. SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS BEEN CREATED BY NATURE, LIKE WATER OR WIND OR SOMETHING REPETITIVE OVER TIME ON THE ROCK'S SURFACE. ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S GET BACK TO IT, MAN. WE GOT A LOT TO DO.  I HAVE A LOT TO DO. NOT A LOT OF SUNLIGHT,  SO... Jeremy: HEY, YOU GUYS,  I'M GONNA SET UP A TRIP WIRE AROUND  THIS WHOLE PARAMETER, A YELLOW LINE ALL THE WAY  AROUND OUR CAMP. IF ANYBODY TOUCHES IT --  JAGUAR, WHATEVER -- IT'S GONNA POP OFF A FLARE.  OKAY. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPEND  A NIGHT IN A JUNGLE THAT'S SO DEADLY,  SO FULL OF PREDATORS, THAT ALMOST NO ONE  HAS EVER BEEN THROUGH HERE. AND GOING BY OUR TRACK RECORD  ON THIS EXPEDITION -- FROM PIRANHA INVASION  TO CAIMAN ATTACK, A JAGUAR STALKING US -- I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER  IF THERE'S SOME SUBSTANCE TO CAPPY'S SUPERSTITION. IS THIS TREASURE CURSED? I'M NOT GONNA TAKE  ANY CHANCES TONIGHT. THIS TRIP WIRE --  HOPEFULLY, IT'LL ACT AS OUR SECURITY SYSTEM  IN THIS WILDERNESS. OKAY, PULL IT TIGHT. RUN A STRING  FROM THERE TO HERE. I'M GONNA RUN IT ALL THE WAY  ALONG THE BORDER, THERE. HEY, BRETT,  YOU WANT TO TIE IT -- JUST TIE IT TO THAT TREE. I'M GONNA SET THIS UP  WITH A FLARE. I'M GONNA TIE IT RIGHT HERE,  I'M GONNA HAVE IT HELD BACK BY A STICK RIGHT HERE,  AND THEN A LITTLE LEVER. AND SO ANYBODY PULLS IT  ANY WHICH WAY, IT'S GONNA POP  AND GO "BOOM!" YOU'RE A MANIAC. YOU BETTER GET  THIS FIRE GOING. I'M GLAD JEREMY SET UP  THE TRIP WIRE, BUT IT DIDN'T DO  MY SLEEP ANY GOOD. I COULDN'T STOP THINKING  ABOUT THE JAGUAR. I'M JUST GLAD  IT DIDN'T COME BACK. I HOPE WE NEVER SEE THAT DAMN THING AGAIN. Cork: WELL, I'M NOT GETTING  ANY HITS AT ALL, GUYS. Brett: NONE? I KNOW ONE THING --  THIS IS WEARING ME DOWN, MAN. WE'VE BEEN SEARCHING  AND COME FROM ONE CLUE TO THE NEXT CLUE  TO THE NEXT CLUE. IF THESE BUGS WILL LEAVE ME  ALONE, I'LL BE HAPPY. I'M THE OLDEST GUY  ON THE CREW, HERE. IT'S LIKE,  IT'S TAKING A TOLL ON ME. YOU KNOW, IT DEFINITELY IS.  IT'S AN EXHAUSTING PROCESS. Keith: HEY, GUYS, THERE'S ANOTHER STONE OVER HERE. Mehgan: YEAH? YOU THINK ANOTHER WALL?  WHAT DO YOU THINK, JEREMY? THAT'S ABOUT AS MUCH  AS I GOT, TOO. Mehgan: STILL NOT LOOKING LIKE  ANY KIND OF STRUCTURE TO ME, THOUGH, YOU KNOW? Jeremy:  WE CAME UPON STACKS OF ROCKS AND BIG, THICK WALLS, BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING SQUARE  OR RECTANGULAR ROCK FORMATIONS. YOU KNOW, LIKE SOME TYPE OF  A SMALL FORTIFICATION OR BUNKER --  SOMETHING LIKE THAT. Megan: NOTHING HERE. Jeremy:  BECAUSE IF THEY HAD A BUILDING, THEY HAVE A PLACE  TO HIDE SOMETHING. THIS IS A BIG AREA  TO COVER, MAN. WE OUGHT TO BREAK OUT  THAT DRONE WITH THAT THERMAL. ONCE WE FIND SOMETHING  WE THINK'S A TARGET, WE COME BACK WITH GPR. Mehgan: YEP.  Brett: ALL RIGHT. Cork: LET'S GRAB THE DRONE.  Brett: SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. Cork: NOW LET'S GET A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THIS PLACE. LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. Jeremy: OH, WOW. OH, WOW. THERE'S ACTUALLY -- THERE'S A CLEARING RIGHT THERE. YOU SEE, RIGHT THERE? Cork: YEP.  LET'S GET DOWN IN THERE. Jeremy: HOLD ON A SEC. IS THAT --  THINK THAT'S SOMETHING? Keith: YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE  A COUPLE MOUNDS OF SOMETHING. Cork: YEAH, BUT IT'S A LINE.  YOU CAN SEE AN ACTUAL LINE. Jeremy: OH, MAYBE.  IT'S HARD TO TELL. I'M GONNA SWITCH OVER  TO THERMAL. Keith: OH, THERE.  LOOK AT THAT. Jeremy: OH, YEAH, NO, THAT IS.  CHECK THAT OUT. LOOK AT THAT,  CAPPY, RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT THERE. Keith: MM-HMM. Jeremy: IT'S U-SHAPED,  ELEVATED STRUCTURE. IT'S EASIER TO SEE BECAUSE  THE SUN IS HITTING IT FIRST, AND SO IT'S WARMING IT UP IN RELATION  TO THE REST OF THE GROUND. YEAH, WE GOT SOMETHING. IT'S A RECTANGLE --  NOT VERY BIG. THAT COULD BE  A VAULT, A CHAMBER. HERE, GET THIS GPS POSITION. CALL THE OTHERS, MAN.  LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT. IT'S JUST OVER HERE. STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. JUST KEEP ON GOING  THAT DIRECTION. THERE IT IS. Keith: THAT'S -- WOW. THAT'S AWESOME. Jeremy:  THAT'S THAT THERMAL HOT SPOT. YEP, THAT'S THE HOT SPOT. Cork: YEAH, IT'S A BUILDING,  DEFINITELY A BUILDING. THIS WAS WAY OFF. I MEAN, THIS IS FAR AWAY  THE WALLS WE WERE FINDING -- WAY THE HECK OFF. Brett: OH, COOL. Mehgan: OH, NICE! Jeremy: YEAH, LET'S START  DIGGITY-DOGGING, MAN, WE GOT TO SEE WHAT  WE CAN FIND AROUND HERE. I SHALL CLEAR THE WALLS. Keith:  THAT THING'S BEEN GROWING OVER FOR WHO KNOWS HOW MANY  HUNDREDS OF YEARS. Cork: THIS IS ALL READY  TO FALL OVER. Brett:  LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST PISSED OFF  SOME ANTS, CAPPY. Keith: YEAH, NO KIDDING. OH, MY GOD. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. RIGHT HERE --  BIG NEST OF THEM. I'M BACKING OUT.  NOT GOOD. NO, NOT GOOD AT ALL. Mehgan:  LET'S JUST WORK A LITTLE BIT  MORE OF THE MOSS OFF. JUST USE YOUR HANDS. Keith: ALL RIGHT. Jeremy: WHAT IS THAT? HEY, CAPPY, COME HERE. Keith: HOLY SMOKES. CORK, COME HERE. WHAT DO YOU GOT? DUDE,  THAT'S A CARVING. Jeremy:  HEY, CAPPY. CORK, COME HERE. Cork: WHAT DO YOU GOT? DUDE, THAT'S A CARVING. LOOKS LIKE NO OTHER SYMBOLS  WE'VE SEEN SO FAR. Jeremy: NO, THIS IS  TOTALLY UNIQUE. Keith: WHAT'S IT MEAN? Jeremy: I DON'T KNOW. MEHGAN, COME HERE. WE GOT A CARVING HERE, MAN. Mehgan:  [ Laughing ] LOOK AT THAT. Jeremy:  WHAT DO YOU THINK, MEG? THAT ONE'S REALLY PERPLEXING.  I'M NOT SURE. IT DOESN'T RING TO ME JESUIT  AT ALL. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE  THAT BEING JESUIT. Mehgan:  DOES THAT LOOK GUARANí TO YOU? I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE.  PROBABLY YEAH. Jeremy: THEY CARVE ALL KINDS  OF STUFF, RIGHT? ANIMALS, FIGURINES, RIGHT? YEAH. Narrator: HUNDREDS OF GUARANí  ROCK CARVINGS, DATING BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS, HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED  IN ARGENTINA, PARAGUAY, AND BRAZIL. THESE ETCHINGS OFTEN  FEATURE ANIMAL FOOTPRINTS AND SIMPLE PICTURES OF CREATURES  LINKED TO GUARANí LEGENDS. YEAH, IT'S UNUSUAL. IT ALMOST LOOKS  LIKE IT HAS, LIKE, A DRAGON, OR IT COULD EVEN BE, LIKE, A JAGUAR. Emilio: DOG OR SOMETHING. Cork: I SPENT YEARS STUDYING  JESUIT SYMBOLISM, BUT, TO ME, IT DEFINITELY  DOESN'T LOOK JESUIT AT ALL. IT'S CLEARLY GUARANí, AND I JUST DON'T KNOW  HOW TO INTERPRET IT. Jeremy: THIS IS A MAJOR TWIST  IN THE TALE. TILL NOW, EVERY CLUE  WE'VE FOUND -- ON SNAKE ISLAND LAST YEAR AND THE JUNGLE  THE PAST THREE MONTHS -- HAVE BEEN JESUIT. BUT THIS ONE'S GUARANí. THAT TELLS ME EITHER THE GUARANí  HAVE TAKEN OVER THE TREASURE OR THE JESUITS  HAVE RELIED HEAVILY ON THE GUARANí TO HIDE IT. THE TREASURE SEEMS TO BE  CONSISTENTLY MOVING NORTHWARD, BUT THERE ARE NO JESUIT  MISSIONS NORTH OF HERE. SO THIS MARKER MIGHT BE  HINTING THAT THE LOOT IS NOW HOARDED DEEP  IN GUARANí TERRITORY. IT'S EVEN MORE OFF  THE BEATEN PATH, AND THAT MEANS OUR JOB  HAS JUST BECOME A LOT HARDER. Brett: SO, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT  WE'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THIS  IN A LONG TIME. Jeremy: THAT'S GOOD NEWS. I MEAN,  THAT'S REAL GOOD NEWS. SO, I WANT TO DOCUMENT IT,  THEN I WANT TO CHECK OUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE  RIGHT AROUND HERE. Emilio: LET'S DO IT. [ ALL AGREEING ] Keith: GET 'ER DONE. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] Jeremy: STRUCTURE'S CLEAR.  NOTHING INSIDE. KEEP SEARCHING THE PARAMETER. KEEP SEARCHING NEAR  THE CONSTRUCTION. YOU GUYS, WATCH OUT FOR THOSE SPIDERS, MAN. YEAH, NO KIDDING. Mehgan: THERE'S SURE NO SHORTAGE  OF BUGS IN THIS AREA. LOTS OF INSECTS. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] WE'VE GOT COMPANY. WE HAD PRETTY MUCH DISPERSED  TO REALLY WORK THE AREA. I WAS BY MYSELF, AND THESE GUYS  CAME UP OUT OF THE FOREST. THE GUARANí, THEY CAME IN, AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW  OUR INTENTIONS -- WHY WE'RE THERE,  WHAT WE'RE DOING. [ MAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Brett:  HEY, MEHGAN, COME OVER HERE. HE IS ASKING ME  WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE. WE ARE DOING RESEARCH. Mehgan: ONCE EMILIO WAS  EXPLAINING OUR PURPOSE, YOU COULD FEEL THE TENSION  AND THE TONE JUST CHANGE. AND THEY ARE IN CHARGE  OF THE CARE OF ALL THIS AREA. LIKE A TRIBAL SECURITY? YEAH. JUST DEFENDING  THEIR HERITAGE. Mehgan: CAN YOU ASK THEM  IF THEY KNOW WHAT THIS PLACE HAS BEEN USED FOR  IN THE PAST? Emilio:  THEY KNOW THEIR ANCESTORS WERE LIVING HERE  WITH THE JESUITS -- NO MORE THAN THAT. HE SAID HE'D BE HAPPY  TO INVITE US TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND HAVE THE PROPER CONVERSATION  WITH THEIR CHIEFS. Mehgan: WE HAVE  A GUARANí CARVING ON A STONE THAT WE NEED DECIPHERED. THAT'D BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE IT TRANSLATED FOR US. I MEAN, THE ELDERS SHOULD KNOW. SO LET'S JUST GO  WITH THEM AND TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT THEIR ELDERS KNOW ABOUT THIS, 'CAUSE THEY MIGHT BE  ABLE TO HELP US. [ MAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ] Brett: THESE GUARANí GUYS  ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO COULD POSSIBLY  HELP US FIGURE OUT WHAT THESE STONE MARKERS MEAN AND WHAT THIS WEIRD  PLACE IS ABOUT. AT THE SAME TIME, WE'RE GETTING INTO SOME  OF THE DEEPEST, DARKEST, MOST RECESSED JUNGLE  OF SOUTH AMERICA. AND IF SOMETHING  GOES WRONG OUT HERE, THAT'S "GAME OVER." WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO  WHAT WE GOT TO DO. BUT WE'RE GONNA KEEP OUR EYES  ON THE BACK OF OUR HEAD. Cork: I'M GOING TO TAKE A BREAK,  HIT THE FALLS. I'M TAKING AR. Mehgan: SHOWER? CORK, ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING IN THAT COLD WATER? BRR, MAN. [ LAUGHS ]  THAT'S REALLY COLD WATER. Brett: IS HE GONNA GET NAKED? Jeremy: GEEZ, I HOPE NOT. DOES HE HAVE,  LIKE, A CURTAIN? [ WOLF WHISTLE ] Jeremy: CORK DECIDED TO GO DOWN  IN THE WATERFALL AND TAKE A SHOWER,  WHICH IS COOL, BECAUSE I WAS HAVING  TO HIKE BEHIND HIM. Keith: AT LEAST HE'S  GOT HIS BOOTS ON. Brett:  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? Cork: THIS WATER'S COLD! Keith: WOULD YOU DO THAT?  NO. I WOULDN'T DO IT, EITHER,  MAN. LOOK AT HIM. HE'S GONNA HAVE PNEUMONIA. MAKING ME COLD  THINKING ABOUT IT. WHOO! AW, THAT'S TOUGH  TO LOOK AT. Cork: OH, COLD WATER! AT THE SAME TIME,  I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO TO THERAPY TO GET THAT IMAGE  OUT OF MY MIND. Emilio: HE'S CRAZY. Cork: WHOO! THIS WATER'S COLD! [ LAUGHS ] CRAZY. Jeremy: WE'RE FOLLOWING TWO GUYS  FURTHER INTO THE JUNGLE. IS THIS WORTH THE RISK? Mehgan: THERE'S NO ROAD MAP  TO THIS TREASURE. WE'RE TRYING TO PIECE  THIS TOGETHER EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT  THAT CARVING ON THE ROCK MEANS. WHAT IS IT TIED TO?  WHERE DOES IT LEAD US NEXT? DON'T REALLY SEE  ANY OTHER OPTION OTHER THAN WHAT  WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT AN EASY DEAL. [ GRUNTS ] OH, MAN. Jeremy: HEY, CAPPY? YEAH? YOU OKAY? MAN, I'M GETTING TIRED. I'LL TAKE OVER.
