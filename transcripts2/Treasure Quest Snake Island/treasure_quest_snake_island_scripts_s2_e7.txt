LOOK AT THAT, SEE THAT  STRAIGHT LINE RIGHT THERE? -THAT'S THE --  -OH, LOOK AT THAT. -WHAT IS THAT?  -HOLD ON, HOLD ON. -HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.  -THERE'S MORE. OH!

 HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS WORTH OF GOLD. FOR CENTURIES,  MANY HAVE SEARCHED, FOUGHT, AND DIED FOR  THIS ELUSIVE BOUNTY, BUT ALL HAVE FAILED  TO HOLD ON TO IT. NOW AN ELITE TEAM  OF TREASURE HUNTERS IS FOLLOWING A TRAIL  FROM THE LEGENDARY SNAKE ISLAND INTO ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS  JUNGLES IN THE WORLD TO TRACK DOWN THE MASSIVE  TREASURE OF THE TRINITY. [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] PREVIOUSLY ON  "TREASURE QUEST"... OVER THE PAST YEAR,  THE DARING EXPEDITION TO TRACK DOWN THE LEGENDARY  TREASURE OF THE TRINITY HAS TAKEN THE VETERAN  TREASURE HUNTERS FROM BRAZIL'S SNAKE ISLAND

 INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE DEADLY  JUNGLES OF SOUTH AMERICA. ON SNAKE ISLAND,  IT WAS JUST VIPERS. WHERE WE'RE AT NOW,  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A THOUSAND WAYS TO DIE. [BLEEP] JEREMY! [ GROWLING ] HE'S FOLLOWING US. Narrator: THE TEAM HAS PUT  THEIR LIVES IN JEOPARDY... BRETT! ...TO UNEARTH HISTORIC ARTIFACTS THAT MAKE UP  THE ENORMOUS FORTUNE. Mehgan: THAT LOOKS LIKE  A NOSE PLATE. DEFINITELY INCA. WE'RE TALKING 500-PLUS YEARS OLD.  -REALLY? Cork: THIS IS REAL, DUDE.  JESUIT. Narrator: BUT AS THEY RETRACE  THE BLOODY TRAIL OF THE JESUITS  AND GUARANí INDIANS WHO ONCE GUARDED THE TREASURE... Cork:  IT'S A JESUIT TREASURE MAP. Narrator: ...THEY'VE HEADED  DEEPER INTO TERRITORY WHERE FEW HAVE DARED TO GO. THE EXPLORERS HAVE UNCOVERED  A CRITICAL CLUE THAT MIGHT LEAD THEM TO  THE TREASURE'S RESTING PLACE. Brett:  THAT'S GOT TO BE THE STONE. Narrator: BUT A SINGLE MISSTEP  IN THIS UNCHARTED WILDERNESS... [ ROCKS TUMBLING ]  Brett: OH [BLEEP] Narrator: ...MIGHT ALSO  SEAL THEIR FATE. -BRETT!  -ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? IT'S NOW ALL ON THE LINE FOR  THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY. HEY, GUYS, I THINK  I HAVE SOMETHING! WHAT IS IT? IT LOOKS LIKE AN EGG ALMOST,  LIKE A HUGE EGG! CAN YOU GET IT OUT? HOLD ON, IT'S COVERED IN MUD.  HOLD ON ONE SEC. [ GRUNTS ] WHAT IS THAT? IT LOOKS LIKE A ROCK,  BUT IT'S SMOOTH. IT'S GOT A... [ PANTING ] IT'S GOT AN ENGRAVING ON IT! [ LAUGHS ] BRING THAT THING  DOWN HERE, MAN. OOH! ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING DOWN! [ GRUNTS ] -YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?  -CHECK IT OUT. -WHAT IS THAT?  -IT'S CRAZY, HUH? YOU CAN'T TELL ME  THAT'S NATURAL. NO. IS THAT WHAT THE GUARANí  WERE TALKING ABOUT? IT'S GOT TO BE THE STONE. IT'S DEFINITELY  OUT OF PLACE. YEAH. Narrator: THE TREASURE HUNTERS  HAVE BEEN COMBING THE SHORES AND CLIFFS OF THE NACUNDAY FALLS  IN SEARCH OF A UNIQUE STONE. THE ELDERS OF  A GUARANí VILLAGE ASSERTED THIS STONE WOULD STICK OUT  FROM ITS ENVIRONMENTS AND BE MARKED WITH A CLUE  THAT POINTS TO THE LOCATION OF A LEGENDARY FORTUNE  HIDDEN BY THEIR ANCESTORS AND A BAND OF JESUITS  2 1/2 CENTURIES AGO. THIS IS WILD. I DIDN'T EVER SEE  ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN ANY OF THE JESUIT CARVINGS  THAT WE FOUND SO FAR. HAVE YOU, CORK?  -NO, NOT A TRIANGLE LIKE THAT. HEY, MEHGAN, MEHGAN, WE FOUND  SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  DO YOU GUYS KNOW? THE CIRCLE, I MEAN, THAT COULD  BE A CERTAIN CAVE SYSTEM. BUT WITH THE PYRAMID  OR WHATEVER IT IS? I DON'T KNOW  WHAT THAT MEANS. WHEN I FIRST SEE THIS ROCK,  I GOT REAL EXCITED TO SEE IT BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT THIS  IS WHAT THE GUARANí ELDERS WERE TALKING ABOUT. BUT THE TRIANGLE  WITH THE CIRCLE IN IT, THAT'S JUST A MIND BLOWER. THE MIX OF THE TWO DIFFERENT  SYMBOLS TOGETHER IS NOT SOMETHING I RECOGNIZE. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE  SOME KIND OF -- I HATE TO SAY IT,  BUT WITCHCRAFT DEAL HERE. WHEN BRETT FIRST  SHOWED THAT ROCK, I GOT A BAD FEELING  RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M  JUST MORE KEEN TO IT THAN OTHER PEOPLE OR NOT, BUT  I CAN SURE FEEL THESE THINGS, AND, MAN, IT FELT LIKE  A DARKNESS HAD COME OVER ME. Brett:  WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE. YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT ALL? WHAT COULD IT BE?  I MEAN. Mehgan: HEY! OVER HERE! -LOOK AT THIS.  -WHAT'D YOU GUYS FIND? YEAH. IT'S GOT A CARVING ON IT. -WHERE'D YOU GUYS FIND THIS?  -IT WAS UP TOP. -BRETT.  -UP THERE? BRETT CLIMBED OVER THE BACK SIDE OF THIS THING. THAT'S A REALLY WEIRD  ROCK FORMATION. Brett: BUT IT'S A UNIQUE MARKER BECAUSE YOU CAN FIRST FIND THIS FROM A DISTANCE. -IT'S LIKE A JUNGLE LIGHTHOUSE.  -YEAH. PUTTING IT BACK HIGH,  TUCKING IT AWAY PROTECTS IT ENOUGH  FROM THE ELEMENTS SO THAT OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS,  POSSIBLY, IT'S GONNA BE THERE. Jeremy: MAKES SENSE. IT'S A GOOD FIND, BRETT. I THOUGHT IT WAS  AN EGG. I THOUGHT SOME PTERODACTYL WAS GONNA COME AND, YOU KNOW, ATTACK ME FOR GRABBING ITS BABY. Mehgan: NOT LIKELY, BUT... IT LOOKS LIKE A RIVER ROCK, BUT WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT DOWN AT THE WATERFALL. MY GUESS IS THAT  THIS STONE'S NOT FROM HERE. THAT ROCK IS THE KIND  OF ROCK THAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND AT THE BOTTOM OF JUST  A FEW RIVERS OR STREAMS WITH, YOU KNOW,  QUITE STRONG CURRENT. PROBABLY QUITE A LOT  OF IRON IN IT, YOU KNOW. AS THEY'RE ROLLING AND WEARING DOWN IN THE RIVER, IT'S GONNA DEPOSIT A LOT OF IRON AND MAKES IT HEAVIER. YEAH, IT'S VERY HEAVY. THE BLACK AND RED  IS INDICATIVE OF IRON. YEAH, BUT THERE ARE  NO STREAMS OR CREEKS AROUND. I KNOW A FEW PLACES  WHERE YOU CAN FIND THOSE KIND OF ROCKS, BUT  WHO KNOWS WHICH SPECIFIC PLACE. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, AND THIS CARVING'S OUR OWN LEAD. Brett: WELL, JEREMY,  LET'S HIT THE BOOKS AND FIND OUT WHAT IT MEANS. Narrator: THE TREASURE HUNTERS  ARE NOW HOPING THAT THE SYMBOLS CARVED  IN THE STONE WILL GIVE THEM A DIRECT PATH TO  THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY. I'VE GOT PRETTY MUCH EVERY  JESUIT SYMBOL THAT EXISTS. PROBLEM IS,  WHEN YOU COMBINE SYMBOLS, YOU CHANGE THEIR MEANINGS. SO, I WANT TO SEE  WHAT THE COMBINATION, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY MEANS. THE CIRCLE BY ITSELF IS A CAVE.  I ALREADY KNOW THAT. I CAN'T FIND THE --  I DON'T HAVE THE SYMBOL. I GOT SOMETHING. I HAVE A REFERENCE  TO ALCHEMY. AND WITHIN  THE JESUIT RELIGION, THERE WAS ACTUALLY A GROUP  THAT USED TO PRACTICE ALCHEMY. Narrator: ALCHEMY WAS  A PRIMITIVE FORM OF CHEMISTRY THAT BLENDED MEDIEVAL SCIENCE  WITH SPIRITUALITY. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH CONSIDERED  IT TO BE AN OCCULT DISCIPLINE AND BANNED ITS PRACTICE. HOWEVER, SOME JESUIT GROUPS  AROUND THE GLOBE SECRETLY STUDIED ALCHEMY,  ESPECIALLY ITS COMPLEX USE OF SYMBOLS THAT REPRESENTED  METALS AND NATURAL ELEMENTS. SOME JESUITS, I MEAN,  THEY WERE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST  INTERESTED IN KNOWLEDGE. THEY WERE NOT INTIMIDATED  BY THE CHURCH. FINDING A TIE BETWEEN  THE ALCHEMISTS AND THE JESUITS IS A MONUMENTAL FIND FOR US  BECAUSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE'S A ROGUE ELEMENT  THAT'S INVOLVED WITH THE TREASURE  OF THE TRINITY. THIS GROUP OF JESUITS  THAT MIGHT HAVE KEPT SECRETS ABOUT ALCHEMY WOULD  ALSO BE ABLE TO KEEP SECRETS FROM THE REST OF THE CHURCH ABOUT THE TREASURE  OF THE TRINITY. ALCHEMISTS, THEY WOULD USE  THE SYMBOL OF THE TRIANGLE TO REPRESENT  FIRE AND WATER, DEPENDING ON  WHICH WAY IT POINTS. SO IT POINTS UP, IT'S FIRE, AND IF IT POINTS DOWN,  IT'S WATER. CAN WE RULE OUT ANY KIND OF FIRE CAVE? THERE'S NO VOLCANOS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THIS AREA? NO, NO, NO. THAT'S WATER. SO, WATER CAVE. I KNOW ONLY ONE PLACE  WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FIND ROCKS, STONES LIKE THIS ONE WHERE YOU  GOT A LOT OF UNDERWATER CAVES. REALLY? THE PLACE I'M THINKING  IS THE URUGUA-I. URUGUA-I FALLS. IT HAS CAVES AROUND THE WATERFALL, OR -- UNDERWATER? HOW FAR FROM HERE? SIX, SEVEN,  OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. -MILES?  -YEAH. IT'S QUITE A LONG WAY. ALL RIGHT. BURNING DAYLIGHT.  LET'S GET GOING. Jeremy: I AM ABSOLUTELY  STAGGERED TO FIND A CLUE THAT'S BEEN HIDDEN AWAY  IN THE WILDERNESS FOR 2 1/2 CENTURIES. IT'S A MIRACLE BY ITSELF. TO HAVE POSSIBLY CRACKED  THIS CLUE IS MIND-BLOWING. IF EMILIO'S RIGHT ABOUT  THE ORIGINS OF THIS STONE, THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY  COULD BE SITTING IN AN UNDERWATER CAVE  AT SALTO URUGUA-I. NOW WE JUST HAVE TO CUT THROUGH  MILES AND MILES OF HARSH LANDSCAPE  TO GET OUR HANDS ON IT. Emilio: IT'S GONNA BE  A REALLY TOUGH HIKE. Brett: GUYS, YOU REALLY THINK WE SHOULD HIKE AT NIGHT? WE'LL TRY IT,  SEE HOW FAR WE GET. IF WE GOT TO STOP,  WE'LL STOP AND CAMP. Narrator:  FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS, THE TEAM HAS SCOURED  THE REMOTE JUNGLES AND HISTORIC RUINS  OF PARAGUAY AND ARGENTINA IN SEARCH OF A MASSIVE TROVE  OF GOLD AND SILVER WORTH AROUND $400 MILLION. THEY WILL NOW MAKE  ONE MORE PUSH TO TRACK DOWN THE TREASURE  AT THE LOCATION INDICATED BY THE RIVER ROCK MARKER. Emilio: IN 50 YEARS I BEEN  WORKING IN THIS REGION AS A NATURALIST, YOU KNOW,  I NEVER BEEN THIS DEEP INTO THE JUNGLE THAT WE ARE NOW. [ BIRD KEENING ] Jeremy: I MEAN, THIS IS A LOT  OF BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS THAT WE'RE PAYING OUT. BUT I DON'T MIND THE GRIND, AS LONG AS IT'S  A GRIND WITH A PAYDAY. Keith: HOW DO WE KNOW WE'RE NOT  ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE? A JESUIT WILD GOOD CHASE? I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW. Emilio: SHH.  GUYS, GUYS, SHH, SHH. COME ON, SILENCE. SHH. [ SNAKE RATTLING ] CAN YOU HEAR IT?  -YEAH, I HEAR IT. -RATTLESNAKE?  -YEAH. -[BLEEP]  -SHH, SHH. -WHERE?  -I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T SEE IT. -WHERE?  -HEY, STAY CALM. YOU GUYS, DON'T MOVE, DON'T MOVE. Mehgan: THAT RATTLE,  THAT'S A WARNING. NOBODY MOVE, MAN. SOMEBODY'S TOO CLOSE. GOD, I HATE  THESE THINGS, MAN. WHERE IS IT? TRYING TO SPOT IT. IT'S RIGHT THERE! JEREMY, IT'S RIGHT  BY YOU, DON'T MOVE. WHERE?  RIGHT THERE! Jeremy: GEEZ!  [ SCREAMS ] [ SNAKE RATTLING ] AAH! I HEAR IT.  WHERE IS IT? [ SNAKE RATTLING ] Mehgan:  IT'S RIGHT THERE! JEREMY, IT'S RIGHT  BY YOU, DON'T MOVE. -WHERE?  -RIGHT THERE! Jeremy: GEEZ!  [ SCREAMS ] [ SNAKE HISSING ] AAH! -WATCH OUT.  -GO, GO, GO! GET IT DOWN! I GOT IT, I GOT IT, I GOT IT.  IT'S RIGHT HERE. GOT HIM DOWN. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] I DON'T THINK I'M HIT. I DON'T THINK --  I THINK I'M ALL RIGHT. -FEEL ANY PAIN ANYWHERE?  -NO, I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK I -- I MEAN, I FELT IT.  I FELT IT HIT ME, BUT I DON'T THINK I'M --  I DON'T THINK I'M STRUCK. [ SNAKE HISSING ] Keith: HOLD THAT SUCKER DOWN, CORK. HEY, JEREMY. YEAH. TWO HOLES RIGHT HERE. THE FANGS DIDN'T GO  ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE GATORS. SMART YOU HAD THOSE ON. Emilio: YEAH, TROPICAL  RATTLESNAKE TAKES MORE LIVES THAN ANY OTHER SNAKE  IN SOUTH OR NORTH AMERICA. IF YOU'D GOT BITTEN BY  THAT SNAKE HERE WHERE WE ARE -- YEAH, I KNOW, EMILIO. ANTIVENOM'S POINTLESS WHEN  YOU'RE TWO DAYS AWAY FROM IT. YEAH. GET THAT DANG SNAKE  OUT OF HERE. Cork: YEAH,  I'LL GET IT OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO FIND A CAMPING SPOT. I DON'T WANT  TO WALK IN THE NIGHT AGAIN, GETTING STRUCK BY ANOTHER SNAKE. [ WIND WHISTLING ] Keith: WHY IN THE HELL  AM I IN THIS JUNGLE WITH ALL THESE DANGEROUS  CRITTERS LOOKING FOR TREASURE? YOU KNOW, I COULD BE SITTING  AT HOME WITH MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE. I JUST HOPE THAT  WE'RE REALLY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IF I GO HOME  EMPTY-HANDED, I THINK IT'S GONNA BE  PRETTY TOUGH TO EXPLAIN, YOU KNOW, WHY. [ WIND WHISTLING ] Emilio: HEY, GUYS, I THINK  WE ARE GETTING CLOSE NOW. LOOK! Mehgan:  THAT'S GORGEOUS. AFTER ALL WE HAVE  BEEN THROUGH, HERE IT IS. WOW, LOOK AT  ALL THE CAVES. THERE'S ONE, THERE'S ONE. ACTUALLY, LOOK STRAIGHT  ACROSS THERE. CAVE ENTRANCE RIGHT THERE. NEVER SEEN ANYTHING  LIKE SALTO URUGUA-I. I MEAN, THE THING'S  LIKE SWISS CHEESE. IT'S GOT HOLES AND WATERFALLS  AND ALL THESE CRACKS AND CAVES. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A MILLION  PLACES TO HIDE THINGS. IT'S A NATURAL LABYRINTH. WELL, IF I HAD  TO HIDE A TREASURE, MAN, THIS WOULD BE  THE PLACE TO DO IT. EACH ONE OF THESE CAVES,  HOLES, IS BIG ENOUGH TO HIDE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  WORTH OF GOLD AND SILVER. Emilio: THIS WAY. HOPEFULLY, THIS IS  THE CAVE SYSTEM THAT WILL HAVE THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY  THAT WAS INDICATED BY THE ALCHEMIST'S ROCK. AND AS WE GET READY TO EXPLORE,  I HAVE HIGH HOPES. Jeremy: LOOK AT THIS PLACE. I MEAN, IT'S NOOKS AND CRANNIES  AND HOLES EVERYWHERE. Emilio: THERE ARE A LOT OF POOLS, AND AT THE BOTTOM  OF THESE POOLS, I THINK IS WHERE YOU CAN FIND  THAT SORT OF ROCK. THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE  THEY COME FROM? YEAH, AS FAR  AS I KNOW, YEAH. THERE'S A LOT OF POOLS UP HERE,  TOO, THAT WE CAN START IN. Brett: CORK, EMILIO,  WHY DON'T WE STAY UP HERE  AND METAL DETECT? WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO DOWN  AND SEARCH THOSE POOLS? Jeremy: THE UNDERWATER CAVES,  THOSE ARE PROBABLY WHAT CONCERN ME MOST 'CAUSE IF YOU GET INTO ONE OF THOSE CAVES, AND IT TIGHTENS UP ON YOU,  WITH THAT WATER RUSHING BY YOU, YOU'RE GONNA GET TRAPPED  UNDERNEATH THERE, AND THAT WOULDN'T BE  A NICE WAY TO DIE. DANGEROUS AS HELL, MAN. HOPEFULLY, IT'S WORTH IT. SO, WATER DOGS TO THE WATER? YEP.  LAND DOGS TO THE LAND. LET'S GET TO WORK. Narrator: SALTO URUGUA-I IS  THE ULTIMATE HIDING SPOT -- RIDDLED WITH SEEMINGLY  ENDLESS CAVES, POOLS, AND NATURAL TUNNELS. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE  NATURAL FORMATIONS ARE NOT CLEARLY VISIBLE,  SO THE TEAM HAS A VERY DIFFICULT AND HAZARDOUS  SEARCH AHEAD OF THEM. ALL RIGHT, GUYS,  LET'S START AT THE BACK AND THEN JUST MAYBE  WORK OUR WAY THAT WAY? THE LAND TEAM WILL SCOUR  THE CAVES IN THE ROCK FACE AND THE SMALL POOLS  ON TOP OF THE WATERFALL. -START UP HERE?  -YEAH. WE CAN GET  THE R.O.V. GOING, TOO. Narrator: WHILE THE WATER TEAM  WILL DEPLOY AN UNDERWATER ROVER AND FREE-DIVE THE MANY POOLS  AND SECRET PASSAGES AT THE BASE OF THE FALLS. Keith: I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, MEHGAN, THAT WATER'S GONNA  BE REALLY COLD. THERE SHE IS. AWESOME. TAKE A LOOK, DUDE. IT'S GOT THE SAME COLOR, SAME WEIGHT DENSITY, AND YOU CAN SEE THE IRON. THAT'S EXACTLY LIKE THAT OTHER ROCK, MAN. I'D SAY WE'RE IN THE RIGHT  PLACE, YOU KNOW? Mehgan: FIRST POOL, FEELING  REALLY LUCKY RIGHT NOW. THIS IS IDENTICAL,  MINUS THE CARVING, TO THE ROCK THAT BRETT FOUND  UP ON TOP OF THAT PINNACLE. WE'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT,  THAT'S WHAT THIS IS TELLING US. I'M NOT LEAVING THIS PLACE UNTIL WE FIND SOMETHING. WE FOUND EVIDENCE  THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING. ALL THE CLUES  SEEM TO BE LINING UP. THE JESUIT MARKER OUTSIDE  THE SANTA ANA MISSION BROUGHT US TO  THE UNMAPPED RUINS, WHERE WE FOUND  THE GUARANí MARKER. THAT LED US TO  THE SPECIAL STONE IN NACUNDAY. AND THAT POINTED US HERE,  THE SALTO URUGUA-I. THESE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM  OF THE POOL ARE TELLING US THAT WE'RE AT THE RIGHT PLACE. THIS IS CONNECTING THE DOTS. GO TO THE NEXT POOL? Mehgan: WE'VE GOT  A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER. IT MIGHT TAKE DAYS OR WEEKS,  BUT WE KNOW WE'VE GOT THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY  IN OUR CROSS HAIRS. REAL STRONG CURRENTS  IN THIS PLACE. LET'S SEND THE ROVER DOWN FIRST TO SEE IF IT'S SAFE TO DIVE. Keith:  TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE READY. ALL RIGHT, MAN, GO AHEAD AND LAUNCH HER. [ BEEPING ] IT'S PRETTY DEEP. IT'S A LOT DEEPER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS. [ BEEPING ] IT'S 35 FEET RIGHT THERE. IT'S GETTING PULLED HARD. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF LITTLE CRACKS AND CREVICES IN THERE. [ BEEPING ] LOOK AT THAT. SEE THAT STRAIGHT LINE RIGHT THERE? THERE'S A STRAIGHT LINE, SOMETHING STRAIGHT RIGHT THERE. LOOKS LIKE IT,  DOESN'T IT? THAT'S PROBABLY JUST A STICK, THOUGH. I MEAN, THERE'S SOME OTHER LITTLE THINGS AROUND IT AND STUFF,  YOU KNOW? -NO, NO, THAT'S NO STICK.  -WHAT IS THAT? -THAT'S NO STICK.  -WHAT IS IT, WHAT IS THAT? HOLD ON, HOLD ON. -WHOA, WHOA!  -NO, THAT'S SOMETHING. Keith:  OH, LOOK AT THAT. DUDE, WE GOT SOMETHING. -WHAT?  -DUDE, LOOK AT THAT. HEY, ROUND EVERYBODY UP, MAN. COME DOWN HERE.  WE GOT SOMETHING. -WHAT IS THAT?  -WHAT IS THAT? Jeremy:  HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON. DUDE, WE GOT SOMETHING. -WHAT?  -DUDE, LOOK AT THAT. I'M GONNA SUIT UP. THERE'S SOME STRONG SUCTION. AND SO, WORST CASE SCENARIO  WOULD BE YOU DIVE, THIS THING GET SUCKED INTO  ONE OF THOSE HOLES, AND THEN IT STARTS  SQUEEZING ON YOU. THERE'S A LOT OF CURRENTS  IN THIS WATERFALL SYSTEM. IT'S DANGEROUS AS HELL,  AND THERE'S A LOT OF LITTLE TUNNELS AND STUFF  WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. THIS IS ALL VIRGIN TERRITORY, BUT MEHGAN'S  A WORLD CHAMPION FREE DIVER, SO IF ANYBODY WAS  TO STAY SAFE DOWN THERE, IT WOULD BE HER. GO FOR IT. WHAT DO YOU GOT? I DON'T KNOW,  BUT IT'S MAN-MADE. I MEAN, LOOK AT IT.  -DEFINITELY. -OH, WOW.  -[ LAUGHS ] -OH, YEAH.  -SO COOL. WHAT DO YOU GOT, MEG? MAN, IT'S WEDGED IN THAT CRACK,  LIKE, REALLY SOLID. I'M GONNA NEED THE NEMO  SO I CAN DRILL AROUND IT. WHAT IS IT? THAT'S AWESOME. [ DRILL WHIRRING ] [ HAMMERING ] COME ON, MEHGAN. Mehgan:  WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS! -CHECK THAT OUT.  -[ LAUGHS ] -WOW.  -YEAH! -MEHGAN, YOU DID IT, EH?  -WHOO! THAT'S COOL. HAVING FOUND AN INCAN TUMI, I MEAN, WE ARE BACK  ON THE TRAIL AGAIN. WE'RE BACK ON THE HOT TRAIL  OF THE INCAN LOOT. Jeremy: AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,  THIS IS FLAT-OUT STATING THAT THE TREASURE  OF THE TRINITY IS HERE. THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE.  THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE. WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. I'M NOT RISKING  MY LIFE FOR NOTHING. THIS IS IT, MAN. OH, YEAH. [ FIRE CRACKLING ] I TELL YOU, I GOT A REALLY  GOOD FEELING RIGHT NOW. AND HE NEVER  HAS A GOOD FEELING. Mehgan: I KNOW, WE DON'T USUALLY  HEAR THAT FROM THIS GUY, SO. Keith: I GOT A LITTLE  SURPRISE HERE, MEN. -REALLY?  -OH! WHERE DID YOU FIND  MARSHMALLOWS? WHERE DID YOU GET  MARSHMALLOWS?! WHERE DID YOU FIND THESE? YOU CAN'T FIND THOSE  IN THIS COUNTRY. WHILE YOU GUYS WERE  FINDING SILVER BARS IN THE ANTIQUE BLACK MARKET  IN ENCARNACIóN, I WAS IN ANOTHER BLACK MARKET  TRACKING DOWN RUM AND DESSERT. Jeremy: CAPPY, YOU DOG! WE'RE GONNA MAKE, LIKE,  FULL-ON S'MORES, MAN. -WHAT'S THE NAME AGAIN?  -YOU'VE NEVER HAD A S'MORE! -NO.  -OH, MY GOODNESS. Mehgan: YOU HAVE NOT  LIVED YET, MY FRIEND. PUT THE 'MALLOW  ON THE STICK. YOU ROAST IT. CHOCOLATE ON TOP OF THE MARSHMALLOW ON THE CRACKER. THERE YOU GO, OKAY. THIS IS REALLY GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]  I MEAN... [ LAUGHTER ]  I LIKE IT. HERE'S TO THE SIX OF US --  S'MORES-ATEERS. -CHEERS.  -CHEERS. TOMORROW'S GONNA BE  A GOOD DAY, I JUST KNOW IT. [ BIRD CHIRPING ] MAKE US PROUD! THIS IS IT, MAN.  THIS IS IT. NO? GONNA BE A WHILE,  I THINK. [ CLICKING ] Emilio:  YOU FIND SOMETHING? Brett: YOU GUYS WANT TO WARM UP,  CALL IT A DAY? [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] Narrator: WHILE MEHGAN  AND JEREMY RETURN TO DIVING THE POOLS,  THE LAND TEAM CONTINUES METAL-DETECTING THE CAVES  AND PLATEAU AT THE TOP OF THE WATERFALL. YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH, I'M GETTING TIRED OF SWINGING THIS DETECTOR. NO KIDDING, MAN. IN VIETNAM EVERY MORNING, I USED TO CLEAR ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES AND ANTI-TANK MINES. REALLY? THAT'S WHY I FEEL BETTER WITH  YOU GOING FIRST ALL THE TIME. YEAH, WE WERE GETTING SHOT AT ALL THE TIME DOING THAT, TOO. GETTING SHOT AT  WHILE CLEARING MINES. YOU'RE A BAD  SON OF A BITCH, CAP. [ BEEPING ] WAIT A MINUTE. I MAY HAVE GOT SOMETHING HERE, GUYS. IT'S NOT GOLD, BUT -- YEAH, IT'S ROUND, AND IT'S HEAVY. -WHAT IS IT?  -IT'S A MUSKET BALL, MAN. -WHAT?  -IT'S A MUSKET BALL. OH, MY GOD. IT'S PROBABLY  A SPANISH WEAPON. I WOULD ASSUME  PROBABLY AROUND 1700. IT'S KIND OF DISTORTED. YEAH, IT'S NOT VERY ROUND. SO THAT MEANS IT SUFFERED  A LOT OF HEAT. SO THEY DEFINITELY  HAVE BEEN FIRED. YEAH. LET'S LOOK AROUND A LITTLE MORE  AND SEE WHAT WE GOT. [ BEEPING ] OH, I GOT SOMETHING HERE, CAPPY. DANG, DUDE. SAME THING, MAN.  HEY, CAPPY! YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY  TREASURE HUNTER HERE? ABOUT TIME! DEFINITELY STARTING  TO LOOK LIKE WE'VE HAD A FEW PEOPLE  SHOT AT HERE, MAN. YEAH. IF I WAS GETTING SHOT AT, I'D BE GETTING BEHIND THESE ROCKS FOR SURE, MAN. WE NEED TO  ANALYZE THESE CLUES AND SEE IF ANYBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS. Jeremy: MUSKET BALLS.  THIS S A PUZZLE. YEAH, THE WAY WE FOUND THEM,  IT APPEARED THAT THERE AS LIKE A SHOOT OUT, AND THE MUSKET BALLS WERE FLYING BY THEM. I THINK IT'S MORE QUESTIONS THAN  ANSWERS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? Mehgan: WE'RE NOT FINDING  ANYMORE ARTIFACTS, SO I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IS THIS MAYBE  WHERE THE JESUITS LOST CONTROL  OF THE TREASURE? DID SOMEONE RAID THIS PLACE AND LOOT THE TREASURE FROM THE JESUITS  AND THE GUARANí? THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BATTLE HERE, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO WON. YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WAS  JUST IN-FIGHTING. -YEAH.  -MAYBE THE JESUITS AND GUARANí BEAT THE INTRUDERS. THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT,  BANDITS, WHOEVER. AND THAT MEANS THE TREASURE  COULD STILL BE HERE. Emilio: YEAH. I MEAN, LET'S NOT FIXATE  ON JUST NEGATIVE SCENARIOS. WE'VE COME ALL THIS WAY. LET'S JUST GIVE IT  ONE MORE PUSH TOMORROW. YOU KNOW, I'VE STILL  GOT HOPE, GUYS. -YEAH.  -YEAH. YOU KNOW, I HOPE  THESE MUSKET BALLS HAVEN'T BLOWN UP  THE WHOLE EXPEDITION. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GONE  TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO FIND THIS TREASURE,  GAVE UP SO MUCH TO BE HERE, I MEAN, EMOTIONALLY  AND FINANCIALLY, BEING AWAY FROM MY FAMILY. ALL THIS CAN'T BE FOR NAUGHT. THERE'S NO WAY. I'M NOT RAISING  THE WHITE FLAG YET. WE'RE GONNA COMB  EVERY INCH OF THIS PLACE BECAUSE THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE. THERE JUST HAS TO BE. HOPEFULLY THIS IS A GOOD ONE! Narrator: MEHGAN HAS COMBED THROUGH THE TWO LARGE RESERVOIRS AT SALTO URUGUA-I. AND WILL NOW FREE DIVE  THE THREE SMALLER POOLS AT THE BASE OF THE WATERFALL. Keith:  I SEE HER LIGHT. WHOO! Jeremy: HEY, YOU BETTER CHECK  HER EARS FOR GILLS, CAPPY. THIS THING GOES  ON AND ON AND ON. DOES IT, REALLY? Mehgan: THE SMALL POOL OPENS UP  INTO THESE TALL SHAFTS OF ROCK THAT LOOK LIKE THEY LEAD ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP  OF THE WATERFALL. IT'S RIDDLED WITH HOLES  AND TUBES AND CAVERNS. AND SO WE ALL NEED  TO GET UP TO THE TOP OF THE WATERFALL  AND CHECK THESE TUNNELS OUT. ALL RIGHT, GET IN THOSE HOLES, MAN. Narrator: THE EASIEST WAY  TO ACCESS THESE SHAFTS IS FROM THE TOP  OF THE WATERFALL, SO JEREMY WILL RAPPEL  DOWN THESE VERTICAL TUNNELS TO METAL DETECT  THE MANY CREVICES AND WATER-FILLED HOLES. WHOA. THIS IS SLIPPERY, MAN. ALL RIGHT, GO SLOW! Brett: I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE, SO -- YEAH. OOH, THESE ARE DEEP, MAN. THESE ARE REAL DEEP. FIND US SOME GOLD,  HOMIE. WHOA. GET ANY HITS? NO. DON'T WORRY,  YOU'LL KNOW WHEN I DO. ANYTHING?! NAH, NOTHING. YOU SURE IT'S WORKING? YEAH, THAT'S WORKING. I'M GETTING TIRED OF FINDING  NOTHING, THOUGH, MAN. YEAH, DON'T WORRY, WE'LL FIND SOMETHING, MAN. NOTHING. Keith: IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT  TO FIND SOMETHING AND GET REALLY JAZZED ABOUT,  YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING, AND, WOW, YOU KNOW,  WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRAIL, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,  BAM, THE TRAIL GOES COLD. THEN YOU START TO SECOND-GUESS  YOURSELF AND WONDER, ARE WE REALLY  IN THE RIGHT PLACE? I JUST KIND OF WANT  TO EXPLORE THAT EDGE RIGHT UNDER THE WATERFALL. HOW YOU DOING? -THESE GUYS ARE EXHAUSTED.  -THEY'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN, THREE AND FOUR MINUTES EVERY TIME, YOU KNOW? MAN, LOOK AT ALL THESE  SPIDER WEBS IN HERE. I'M NOT SURE, CORK,  BUT THIS IS A VERY OLD ORANGE OR LEMON TREE. OH, NO KIDDING?  HUH. YOU KNOW LEMONS ARE NOT NATIVE FROM THIS JUNGLE. IF YOU FIND ORANGE  OR LEMON TREE, IT'S BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE  FROM EUROPE PLANTED, YOU KNOW. IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN  BROUGHT HERE. SO MAYBE, THIS IS JESUIT. I MEAN, THE JESUITS PLANTED  THESE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THIS MIGHT BE A SIGN. THAT'S A SIGN THAT  THEY CAME THIS WAY. Emilio: YEAH. OH, MAN, THAT IS A --  AAH. THAT'S A LEMON. LOOKS LIKE AN ORANGE, BUT IT'S A LEMON. YEAH, IT'S A LEMON. [ LAUGHS ] Brett: COME ON, MEG! [ GASPS ] HEY! WHAT DO YOU GOT? LOOK AT THIS! OH, MY GOD! -WHOO!  -WHAT IS THAT? THAT LOOKS LIKE  GOLD, MAN. -THAT'S GOLD!  -WHOO! LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S INCAN. -MAN, LOOK AT THAT.  -WHOO. THERE'S LIKE  A WHOLE CAVERN BACK THERE. IT WAS JUST SITTING IN THERE,  AND IT, LIKE, SPARKLED. WELL, IS THERE ANY MORE? IS THERE ANY MORE  STUFF IN THERE? YOU KNOW, I THINK  THERE'S MORE BACK THERE. THERE'S MORE. THIS IS JUST A PIECE. THAT'S JUST ONE OF SOMETHING. I GOT NO DOUBT IN MY MIND,  IT'S GOLD. -YEAH.  -THAT'S GOLD, MAN! Jeremy: IT'S UNTARNISHED. YOU KNOW, AND THE ONLY METAL  THAT DOESN'T TARNISH IS GOLD. YOU KNOW, IT'S INERT. AND SO YOU CAN FIND SOME  1,000 YEARS OLD, IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE  IT WAS MADE YESTERDAY. THIS IS A GOLD MASK,  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT DURING  INCAN CEREMONIES AND EXTREMELY SYMBOLIC. Narrator: CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY IS MADE UP OF PRICELESS  ANCIENT GOLD AND SILVER. THE MASK IS A REPRESENTATION  OF THE INCAN SUN GOD INTI. INCA KINGS ORDERED  THAT ALL ARTWORK DEPICTING THE SUN GOD BE MADE  ONLY OF GOLD BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED  THE PRECIOUS METAL TO BE THE SWEAT OF THE SUN. DEPENDING ON THE WEIGHT  AND QUALITY OF THE GOLD, THIS EXTREMELY RARE ARTIFACT  COULD FETCH AS MUCH AS A QUARTER OF A MILLION  DOLLARS AT AUCTION. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE,  BEAUTIFUL ARTIFACT. WOW. Cork: YOU KNOW, ON A PERSONAL  LEVEL, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE FACE OF INTI EVER SINCE  I WAS A CHILD IN MY OWN HOME. WE USED TO HAVE INTI HANGING  ON MY WALL AT MY HOUSE 'CAUSE EVERYBODY  WHO'S AN ECUADORIAN HAS ONE OF THESE IN THEIR HOME. FOR US TO FIND SOMETHING  LIKE THIS OF INTI IN THIS PLACE IN ARGENTINA, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST  IMPORTANT, SIGNIFICANT FINDS OF INCAN TREASURE  IN THE LAST 500 YEARS. THIS VALIDATES  EVERYTHING. I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND  ANYTHING ON THIS TRIP. I DIDN'T COME HERE THINKING THAT  WE WERE GONNA FIND TREASURE. AND WHEN MEHGAN  CAME OUT WITH THE GOLD, IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT. AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE  GETTING EXPERIENCE HISTORY WITH YOUR HANDS  AND NOT IN A BOOK IS JUST A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME  OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE GONNA FIND THE REST OF THIS TREASURE 'CAUSE IT'S HERE! THIS IS JUST A BIT OF IT. THERE'S A LOT MORE HERE WE'RE GONNA GO AFTER. Jeremy: THIS SUN MASK IS JUST  THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, AND THERE'S SO MANY  CREVICES AND CRACKS. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,  THERE'S MORE. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF US GETTING IN THERE AND KEEP WORKING AT IT. -HEY!  -FOUND SOME MORE. -WHAT IS THAT?  -LOOK AT THIS! [ LAUGHS ] LOOK AT THAT! WE FOUND THE TUMI  AND THREE MORE PIECES, IT'S LIKE -- Cork: THOSE ARE LLAMAS. THAT'S FROM THE ANDES. THAT'S INCA COUNTRY. THERE'S SO MANY HOLES,  SO MANY POCKETS, SO MANY BOULDERS DOWN THERE. I MEAN, IT'S -- THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH  HELL AND BACK, SNAKE ISLAND TO HERE, YOU KNOW. IT'S BEEN A LONG TRAIL. HERE'S TO ALL THAT HARD WORK  PAYING OFF, HUH, GUYS? -DEFINITELY.  -WHOO! Mehgan:  MY ADRENALINE IS STILL PUMPING. EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING,  THE BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS, AND THIS JUST  VALIDATES ALL OF IT. IT VALIDATES ALL OF IT. -WHOO, MEHGAN!  -WE DID IT. -WE DID IT.  -HELL, YEAH. -WHOO!  -[ LAUGHS ] [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Jeremy: WE COULD FINALLY SAY  WE TRACKED DOWN THE TREASURE OF THE TRINITY. WE'VE ALREADY FOUND MORE HERE THAN WE DID IN ALL OUR PREVIOUS  SEARCH AREAS COMBINED. FROM SNAKE ISLAND  TO SANTA ANA MISSION, BUT TO LOCATE AND RETRIEVE  MASSIVE, MASSIVE HOARD OF GOLD AND SILVER  ARTIFACTS IN A PLACE LIKE THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LONG WHILE --  MONTHS, EVEN. AND SO I THINK IT'S  JUST A MATTER OF TIME. WE BRING IN THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT,  MORE MANPOWER, AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA  FIND THE MOTHER LODE. WE'RE GONNA FIND  THE WHOLE THING. WHOO-HOO! WE'RE GONNA  BE HERE FOR A WHILE. [ LAUGHTER ]
