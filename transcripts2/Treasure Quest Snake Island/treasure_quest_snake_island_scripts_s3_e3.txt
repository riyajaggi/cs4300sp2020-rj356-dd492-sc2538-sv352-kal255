 [ HEAVY BREATHING ] [ GRUNTING ] JACK!  I THINK I'M STUCK. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY  DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪♪ Narrator:  A COLOSSAL HORDE OF GOLD IS RUMORED TO BE HIDDEN IN A REMOTE VALLEY  IN WESTERN BOLIVIA. ♪♪ OVER THE LAST THREE CENTURIES, HUNDREDS HAVE DIED  FOR THIS LEGENDARY TREASURE THAT COULD BE WORTH  OVER $2 BILLION. ♪♪ NOW, A BRAVE GROUP  OF TREASURE HUNTERS, THIS IS THE SPOT. ARMED WITH A NEW LEAD... TREASURE IS DOWN,  UNDERNEATH THE MONASTERY. ...AND INTEL FROM  A CENTURY OF PAST ATTEMPTS, WILL USE CUTTING-EDGE  TECHNOLOGY... Jeremy: THAT'S A VOID. ...AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO TAKE THE VALLEY'S  DANGERS HEAD ON. [ BELL TOLLS ] GET DOWN!  [ BATS SCREECHING ] AND IF THEY CAN SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE SACAMBAYA, THEY CAN FIND THE TRAIL  TO THE TREASURE. THIS IS JESUIT GOLD. -JEREMY!  -HOLD TIGHT! Shawn: THREE! TWO! ONE! INCOMING! ♪♪ ♪♪ PREVIOUSLY ON  "TREASURE QUEST"... THIS BRUSH IS  INCREDIBLE. YEAH, NO ONE'S BEEN HERE  FOR A LONG TIME. THE TEAM HAS MADE  A SUCCESSFUL START IN THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY... THIS CHALICE?  WHAT AN AMAZING FIND. ...AND SPLITS UP  TO COVER MORE GROUND. ♪♪ AS SHAWN CARRIES OUT  A PRECAUTIONARY SEARCH OF A HILL THAT WAS THE FOCUS  OF ALL PAST EXPEDITIONS, [ GRUNTS ] I BET YOU THIS WAS FROM PRADER'S EXPEDITION, MAYBE EVEN SANDERS'. HIS TEAMMATES HAVE DETECTED  AN UNDERGROUND VOID NEAR THE RUINS  OF A JESUIT MONASTERY. THAT'S A MAJOR  ABERRATION. WE'VE GOT  SOMETHING HUGE. WHICH LEADS TO  A MONUMENTAL DISCOVERY. -WHOA!  -THAT'S A BIG HOLE. -WE'VE GOT OUR CAVE, JACK.  -WOO-HOO! ♪♪ Jeremy: LOOK AT THIS THING. THIS TUNNEL HAS BEEN BURIED  FOR 300 YEARS, AND WE JUST UNCOVERED IT. THIS COULD BE THE KEY. ♪♪ [ FIRE CRACKLING ] ♪♪ [ HEAVY BREATHING ]  WHAT DID WE FIND? ♪♪ ALL THE EXPEDITIONS  FOR THE SACAMBAYA TREASURE, WE'RE PROBABLY THE FIRST ONES  TO ACTUALLY FIND THIS. Narrator: DEEP IN  THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY, JEREMY AND JACK HAVE UNCOVERED  A CENTURIES-OLD TUNNEL, 15 FEET BELOW GROUND NEAR LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY. THIS DISCOVERY COULD BE  A MAJOR TURNING POINT FOR THE EXPEDITION BECAUSE THE TUNNEL  MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUILT TO TRANSPORT OR STASH  A $2 BILLION HORDE OF GOLD KNOWN AS THE SACAMBAYA TREASURE. ♪♪ AND FROM ALL INDICATIONS, IT HAS NEVER BEEN  SEARCHED BEFORE. MAJOR UNDERTAKING  TO CUT A TUNNEL LIKE THIS. CHISELED OUT BY HAND. ISOLATED AS HELL. NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN  HOW MUCH THEY HAD AND WHERE THEY HAD IT, AND WHEN THEY TRANSPORTED IT. YOU KNOW, THE JESUITS BUILT TUNNELS, YOU KNOW, FROM,  YOU KNOW, ARGENTINA ALL THE WAY  TO THE AMERICAS, AND THEY'RE ALWAYS, ALWAYS FOR SOMETHING SECRETIVE. ♪♪ Narrator:  OVER THE PAST CENTURY, ARCHEOLOGISTS HAVE UNEARTHED MORE THAN 100 JESUIT  TUNNELS AND VAULTS IN FIVE CONTINENTS  AROUND THE GLOBE. BUILT MAINLY  IN THE 1600 AND 1700s, THEIR CONSTRUCTION  VARIES GREATLY. SOME, LIKE THE NETWORK  OF UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES FOUND IN THE HEART OF  MAASTRICHT, NETHERLANDS AND BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA, ARE VERY ELABORATE  AND STRETCH FOR MILES, WHILE OTHERS, LIKE  THE PASSAGEWAYS FOUND IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, ARIZONA,  OR PASCO, PERU, ARE CRUDE CONSTRUCTIONS,  SHORTER THAN 100 YARDS. HOWEVER, HISTORIANS BELIEVE THAT NEARLY ALL  OF THESE SECRET TUNNELS WERE USED AS EITHER ESCAPE ROUTES DURING EMERGENCIES OR AS STASH POINTS  FOR HIDING VALUABLES. ♪♪ [ BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY ] SO I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY, THIS IS A JESUIT TUNNEL THAT'S BUILT PRETTY CLOSE  TO LA PLAZUELA, AND YOU KNOW, GOES FROM LA PLAZUELA  TO WHO KNOWS WHERE. [ CHUCKLES ] HOPEFULLY TO $2 BILLION. Jeremy: YOU KNOW,  THE JESUITS WERE PRETTY CRAFTY. THEY WERE SUPER MECHANICAL. THEY BUILT TRANSPORT  SYSTEMS, TUNNELS, BETWEEN CHURCHES,  GOING TO DIFFERENT STOREHOUSES, LIVING QUARTERS. SOME OF THE TUNNELS CAN  BE 8 OR 9 MILES LONG. THE FACT THAT THIS TUNNEL  IS NEAR LA PLAZUELA, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THIS IS WHERE THEY'RE GONNA  HIDE THE TREASURE. ♪♪ KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR ANY JESUIT MARKINGS. THEY USED ALL KINDS OF SYMBOLS. I MEAN, ALCHEMY SYMBOLS,  GREEK SYMBOLS. THERE'S PROBABLY 200 DIFFERENT SYMBOLS THAT THEY USED. YEAH. THE TUNNEL WALLS. IT'S DEFINITELY  HAND CUT. I KNOW. THERE'S NO SUPPORTS. NO SHORING, NOTHING HOLDING THIS ROOF UP EXCEPT HARD ROCK. IT DOESN'T LOOK SAFE.  I MEAN, LOOK. I MEAN, IT'S JUST HANGING ON. YEAH.  IT'S LAYERED STRATUM. I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO EVEN TALK  AT A REGULAR TONE. WHOLE THING  COULD COME DOWN. ♪♪ Narrator: 3 MILES FROM  THE NEWLY-DISCOVERED TUNNEL, EXPEDITION LEADER SHAWN COWLES HAS DEPLOYED  A GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR TO DO AN IN-DEPTH SEARCH  CABALLO CUNCO HILL. ALL PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS  HAD TARGETED THIS HILL, BUT FOUND NO SIGNS  OF THE TREASURE OR ANY UNDERGROUND  HIDING SPOTS. NOW SHAWN HAS USED  STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT TO COMB THROUGH THE ENTIRE HILL, INCLUDING THE SOUTHERN END THAT HAD NEVER BEEN  SEARCHED BEFORE. BUT HIS TWO-DAY INVESTIGATION HAS REACHED  A SIMILAR CONCLUSION. ♪♪ HEY, JAVI!  GETTING ANY HITS? YOU KNOW, I SEARCHED  THROUGH THE WHOLE AREA, AND NOTHING. OH, GOD. THERE'S NOTHING HERE. THERE'S NO VOIDS HERE. THERE'S NO MAJOR  TUNNELS HERE. YEAH, WE CAN  CROSS THAT OUT. I'M CONFIDENT THE JESUITS WERE  TRULY TRYING TO DIVERT PEOPLE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. GET PEOPLE OFF THE SCENT. THE JESUITS PROBABLY PUT THAT INFORMATION IN THAT SAN RAMON DOCUMENT JUST TO GET EVERYBODY  TO COME HERE AND NOT FOCUS  ON THE MONASTERY. BUT, YOU KNOW, NONE OF THE HISTORIC RECORDS ACTUALLY SAID  "CABALLO CUNCO." THE SAN RAMON DOCUMENT  WAS A LITTLE VAGUE. IT DIDN'T SAY ABSOLUTELY  CABALLO CUNCO, YOU KNOW. IT JUST SAID A MOUND, PLATEAU,  EGG-SHAPED ROCK. YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE  THAT THEY WERE POINTING US IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  DIRECTION, YOU KNOW, TO ANOTHER MOUND  WITH A PLATEAU ON IT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, LA PLAZUELA IS A PLATEAU  IN THE VALLEY, SO I THINK  WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. [ BRANCHES RUSTLING ] LET'S GET BACK  TO BUSINESS. BACK TO PLAZUELA. ♪♪ Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE KATU RIVER, JEREMY AND JACK ARE CAUTIOUSLY MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH  THE PRECARIOUS JESUIT TUNNEL THAT IS SHOWING SIGNS  OF CRUMBLING IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES.

JEREMY, RIGHT HERE. SEE THIS MARK? YEAH. THESE ARE DRILL MARKS  WHERE THEY WERE CUT BY HAND WITH STEEL  AND A HAMMER. Jeremy: WOW. THEY'D HAVE A SINGLE, OR WHAT THEY CALL DOUBLE-JACK DRILL SYSTEM, WHERE THEY HAVE  DRILL STEEL, AND SOMEONE HITTING IT  WITH A HAMMER. A DOUBLE IS WHERE SOMEONE WAS HOLDING THE STEEL  AND TURNING IT WHILE SOMEONE ELSE  WAS HITTING IT. [ SIGHS ] BRUTAL WORK.  YEAH, BRUTAL. ♪♪ MY GUESS IS, THEY'RE CHASING GOLD THAT WAS IN THESE SEAMS. SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU'RE SAYING THIS WAS MORE  THAN JUST A TUNNEL TO TRANSPORT TREASURE? WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY, I MEAN, IT'S DEFINITELY A SECRET-LOOKING TUNNEL, BUT IT'S ALSO PROBABLY A FUNCTIONING MINE,  AT SOME POINT. ♪♪ Jeremy:  THIS IS AN OLD TUNNEL. THERE'S CHISEL MARKS, YOU CAN SEE THEIR BORE MARKS, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO SHORING. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT  WAS DONE, YOU KNOW, IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS OR SO. I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT  THIS IS CONSTRUCTION FROM THE 17th, 16th CENTURY. [ WATER DROPPING ] ♪♪ Jack: WELL,  THE TUNNEL'S DEEP. Jeremy: THIS IS  JUST A PIECE. THIS THING GOES  ON AND ON.

Jack: DUE TO THE EXTREME  WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE GEOLOGICAL MAKEUP  OF SOME OF THE ROCKS IN THIS PART OF BOLIVIA, CAVE-INS ARE PRETTY COMMON. IN THIS CASE,  I SAW THE LOOSE SHALE THAT HAD FALLEN DOWN  FROM THE CEILING. IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING THAT WAS BOOBY TRAPPED  BY THE JESUITS. IT JUST HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THERE OR NOT, BUT WE GOTTA FIGURE  SOMETHING OUT. I'M GONNA CLIMB UP  TO THE TOP OF IT AND SEE WHAT  I CAN SEE. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE  A HARD HAT ON. TAKE MINE.

IF YOU START DISLODGING ROCKS  FROM THE CAVE-IN, MORE WILL JUST KEEP  COLLAPSING DOWN. I MEAN, THAT'S HOW  UNSTABLE IT IS. [ GROANS ] THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE  WE COULD TRY. THAT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR, THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY  A CAVE-IN IN THE JESUIT TUNNEL. IT WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED. I MEAN, NOW I GOTTA COME  UP WITH ANOTHER PLAN. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY  TO WORK AROUND THIS. THE THING IS.... HOW LONG IS THE BLOCKADE? Jeremy: RIGHT.  WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. YEAH. Shawn: JEREMY, LET'S USE THE G.P.R. YEAH, I MEAN, YEAH.  WE'LL MAKE SHORT WORK OF IT. SOUNDS GOOD. Shawn: I MEAN, I THINK USING  THE GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR IS OUR BEST CHANCE TO FIND  ANOTHER WAY IN TO THE TUNNEL, TO GET BEYOND THE BLOCKAGE. ♪♪ Narrator: SHAWN'S PLAN  IS TO USE THE G.P.R.

WE COULD A RETRO EXCAVATOR. THE THING IS  GETTING IT HERE. BUT IF THERE IS A ROAD  DOWN TO SACAMBAYA, MY FRIENDS SHOULD KNOW. LET'S PUT THAT PLAN  TOGETHER. Shawn: WE HAD ALWAYS PLANNED  ON SCALING UP THIS EXPEDITION ONCE WE FOUND SOMETHING  SIGNIFICANT, AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, THERE'S NOTHING MORE SIGNIFICANT  THAN FINDING A HIDDEN TUNNEL RIGHT HERE AT LA PLAZUELA. I MEAN, IT'S TIME  TO GET THE BIG GUNS OUT. WE CAN GET SOME HEAVY EQUIPMENT, SOME DEMOLITION GEAR, AT A LOCAL MINING TOWN  CALLED "QUIME." BUT COMING FROM HERE,  IN THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY, IT'S GONNA BE A LONG,  SLOW HIKE TO GET THERE. OF COURSE, IT'LL BE  A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO BRING ALL THAT DOWN  TO THE VALLEY.

[ JAVI LAUGHS ] Narrator: BACK IN  THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY, JEREMY COMES UP WITH A PLAN  TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THE OBJECT HE'S SPOTTED BEYOND THE CAVED-IN PORTION  OF THE ANCIENT TUNNEL. Jeremy: I'M CERTAIN I SAW A PRETTY SIZABLE MAN-MADE OBJECT ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THAT CAVE-IN. YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T  MAKE OUT WHAT IT IS, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY  WORTH INVESTIGATING. THIS THING IS BIG. I DON'T KNOW WHERE  I'M GONNA MOUNT IT. MY IDEA IS TO BORROW ONE OF THE PRODUCTION CREW'S DRONES, DECONSTRUCT IT, AND REINVENT IT AS A REMOTE-CONTROLLED  CRAWLER CAM, AND GIVE US A PEEK INTO WHATEVER LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE. I'M GONNA PUT A CAMERA  UP HERE ON FRONT. SO I'M GONNA ATTACH  ONE OF THE DRONE'S CAMERAS TO ONE OF THE CREW'S  PRE-ASSEMBLED TRACKING RIGS, WHICH IS, BASICALLY, A METAL PLATE WITH WHEELS ON IT. THE CAMERA'S  BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WILL BE ABLE  TO WIRELESSLY TRANSMIT THE CAMERA'S RECORDING  IN REALTIME. THEN, THE TRICKY PART. THE ELECTRONICS OF THE DRONE WILL HAVE TO BE  COMPLETELY REWIRED SO ITS REMOTE CONTROLLER  IS ABLE TO MANEUVER IT WHEN IT CRAWLS INSTEAD OF FLIES. SO, BASICALLY,  WHAT I'M MAKING IS, LIKE, ONE OF THOSE  CRASH AND FLIP CARS, LIKE MY KIDS HAVE, EXCEPT THIS ONE'S  ON STEROIDS -- FULL SUSPENSION, FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE, ONLY THING I'M MISSING,  COUPLE OF LIGHTS RIGHT HERE. ♪♪ [ GRUNTS ] ALL RIGHT.

ALL RIGHT. AS TREASURE HUNTERS, WE'RE IN THE NEEDLE-  IN-A-HAYSTACK BUSINESS, SO IT'S KEY THAT OUR SEARCHES  ARE METHODICAL AND ORGANIZED. THERE'S 10 FEET  RIGHT THERE. AND THAT'S WHAT THESE GRIDS  AND FLAGS HELP US DO. THE SYSTEM MAKES SURE THAT WE DON'T COVER  THE SAME GROUND TWICE, AND THAT ALL POTENTIAL TARGETS ARE CLEARLY MARKED AND RECORDED. I USE WHITE FLAGS  TO MARK OUT THE GRID. [ DEVICE BEEPS ]  OH. IF WE GET ANOMALIES OR HITS  WITHIN THAT AREA, THEN WE USE PINK FLAGS  TO MARK THAT. DIG THAT OUT.  I'LL KEEP GOING. SURE. OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM  WITH TREASURE HUNTING IS THAT NO MATTER HOW  ORGANIZED YOU ARE, 9 TIMES OUT OF 10, YOU'RE GONNA FIND  A PIECE OF CRAP INSTEAD OF A PIECE OF GOLD. I THINK I GOT  SOMETHING HERE. EH, JACK, IT'S JUST  A TINY PIECE OF IRON, MAN. BOYS, MARK THIS CORNER, AND WE'LL JUST KEEP HEADING OUT. THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

I DON'T KNOW --  WE COULD TRY TO GET SOME OF THESE LOGS OR SOMETHING,  PUT 'EM ACROSS. EUCALYPTUS LOGS...  MAKE A BRIDGE? IN BOLIVIA, EUCALYPTUS LOGS ARE VERY COMMON. WE USE THEM A LOT  FOR CONSTRUCTION, SUPPORT THE CEILINGS, THEY ARE VERY  STRONG AND FLEXIBLE. YOU WOULDN'T THINK THEY SUSTAIN  THE WEIGHT THAT THEY DO.

Shawn: LET'S START  GETTING THESE TOGETHER, I THINK IF THEY WERE  ALL INDIVIDUAL, THEY MIGHT REALLY SLIP,  YOU KNOW? SO WHY I'M THINKING,  JAVI, IF WE WERE TO BOLT  TWO OF THEM TOGETHER HERE AND RIGHT HERE, WE COULD DO THEM  IN SECTIONS OF TWO, AND THEN LASH THEM,  SO IT DOESN'T SLIP OUT. Javi: PERFECT. Shawn: MY CONCERN WAS  THAT IF HE JUST ROLLED OVER INDIVIDUAL LOGS, IT'S JUST GONNA START,  KICKING THEM OUT. THAT LOOKS GOOD, SEAN. SO MY THOUGHT WAS,  LET'S BRING SOME LAG BOLTS INTO THE PICTURE HERE, SHORE A FEW OF THESE  TOGETHER. Shawn: TEST THE INTEGRITY OF THEM. I JUST HOPE  THEY CAN HOLD UP. SEE, THAT'S GOOD.  THAT'S TIGHT. SO IF WE CAN DO THAT,  THEN LASH THEM TOGETHER, I THINK IT'LL BE  MUCH STRONGER.
