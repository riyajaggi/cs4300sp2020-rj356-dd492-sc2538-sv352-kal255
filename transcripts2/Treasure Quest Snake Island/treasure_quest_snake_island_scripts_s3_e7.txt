 Narrator:  A COLOSSAL HOARD OF GOLD  IS RUMORED TO BE HIDDEN IN A REMOTE VALLEY  IN WESTERN BOLIVIA. OVER THE LAST THREE CENTURIES, HUNDREDS HAVE DIED  FOR THIS LEGENDARY TREASURE THAT COULD BE WORTH  OVER $2 BILLION. ♪♪ NOW A BRAVE GROUP  OF TREASURE HUNTERS... THIS IS THE SPOT. ...ARMED WITH A NEW LEAD... THE TREASURE IS DOWN  UNDERNEATH THE MONASTERY. ...AND INTEL FROM A CENTURY  OF PAST ATTEMPTS WILL USE CUTTING-EDGE  TECHNOLOGY... ...AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO TAKE THE VALLEY'S DANGERS  HEAD-ON. [ BELL RINGS ] GET DOWN! AND IF THEY CAN SOLVE  THE MYSTERY OF THE SACAMBAYA, THEY CAN FIND A TRAIL  TO THE TREASURE. -JEREMY!  -HOLD TIGHT. Jack:  THREE, TWO, ONE! [ EXPLOSION ]  Jack: INCOMING! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY  DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪♪ PREVIOUSLY ON  "TREASURE QUEST"... YOU HOOKED UP?  -Jack: YEAH. Narrator: THE TEAM DETECTED AN UNDERGROUND VOID AT AN ARROYO LOCATED NORTHEAST  OF LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY. Jeremy: THERE'S DEFINITELY  AN ANOMALY THERE. Jack: THAT'S OUR VOID! LET'S GET DIGGING. Narrator:  BUT GAINING ACCESS TO THE VOID PROVED TO BE  A MAJOR HURDLE. WHOA!  SOMETHING JUST BROKE. Jeremy:  THAT IS CLEAN CRACKED. WE ALMOST LOST A BUCKET. WHY DON'T I PUT  AN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE DOWN INTO THE HOLE? Jack:  THREE, TWO, ONE! [ EXPLOSION ] INCOMING! Narrator: AND WHEN THEY FINALLY  ENTERED THE CAVITY... Jeremy: THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE  THE OTHER TUNNEL. ...THINGS TURNED  EVEN MORE HAZARDOUS. [ ALARM BEEPING ] Jeremy: WE CAN'T STAY DOWN HERE.  IT'S TOXIC. -GET OUT.  -LET'S GO! Jack: [ COUGHS ]  GET OUT, GUYS. ♪♪ Narrator: BUT AT THE BASE  OF THE DRIED-OUT RIVER BED, SHAWN AND JAVIER  UNEARTHED CONCRETE EVIDENCE... Shawn:  LOOK AT THAT, JAVIER. ... THAT VALUABLE  JESUIT ARTIFACTS HAD COME THROUGH  THIS LOCATION. [ BELL RINGS ] COULD THAT BE  THE JESUIT BELL? FROM PLAZUELA. UNBELIEVABLE.  THE STORY THAT COULD TELL. [ BELL RINGING ] ♪♪ [ BELL RINGING ] Shawn: JUST THINK, THAT'S BEEN BURIED  FOR ALMOST 300 YEARS HERE. RIGHT HERE. ♪♪ YOU KNOW, if THIS IS THE BELL. Jeremy: JAVI AND SHAWN. Jack: GUYS. CHECK IT OUT. WHAT THE HELL? YOU GUYS FOUND A BELL. Shawn:  ISN'T THAT AMAZING? THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE,  ISN'T IT? Shawn: IT'S BEAUTIFUL. ♪♪ LOOK AT THIS. THERE'S SOME LETTERS HERE. Jack: CAN YOU READ IT? "MARIA ORA". THIS IS ALL LATIN, RIGHT? -THIS IS LATIN.  -LATIN. Shawn: "PRO..." -"NOBIS."  -"...NOBIS." MOTHER MARY.  PRAY FOR US. DEFINITELY JESUIT. IT WILL BE INTERESTING SEEING WHAT THE MAKEUP IS. I MEAN, IT STOOD  THE TEST OF TIME. SO, LET'S PUT  AN ALLOY TESTER ON IT. Narrator:  AN ALLOY TESTER IS A DEVICE  THAT USES LOW-LEVEL X-RAYS TO QUICKLY ANALYZE AND IDENTIFY THE COMPOSITION  OF ANY METAL OBJECT, MAKING IT THE EQUIVALENT  OF A PERSONAL METAL APPRAISER FOR A TREASURE HUNTER. IT'S MOSTLY COPPER,  TIN. BRONZE  IS TIN AND COPPER. YEAH.  SMALL PERCENTAGE OF GOLD. REALLY GOOD JOB, GUYS. WHEN I SAW WITH JOHN  AND WE TALKED ABOUT SACAMBAYA, HE WAS REALLY SPECIFIC  ABOUT A BELL MADE OF BRONZE. ♪♪ Narrator:  THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE START  OF THIS MISSION, SHAWN COWLES HAD MET  WITH JOHNNY IRWIN... -JOHNNY!  -HELLO. HEY, HEY. Narrator: ...A MEMBER  OF THE 1990 EXPEDITION WHO HAD UNEARTHED  SEVERAL JESUIT ARTIFACTS FROM THIS ARROYO. BRONZE WAS A VALUABLE COMMODITY  BACK THEN. YES. IN FRONT OF  THE LA PLAZUELA, I FOUND MASSES OF BRONZE  THAT HAD MELTED. RIGHT. ALSO, I FOUND SEVERAL PIECES  OF CUT BRONZE PLATE IN THE ARROYO AND BRONZE RIVETS. THERE WAS SOME MAJOR  SMELTING GOING ON THERE. RIGHT. LEGEND SAID AN INCAN KING  HAD A HOUSE OF BRONZE. HIS HOUSE WAS DISMANTLED  BY THE JESUITS. IT WAS BROUGHT TO A SPOT  IN CENTRAL BOLIVIA AND MELTED DOWN  TO MAKE A BELL. Shawn: COULD THIS BE WHAT JOHNNY  WAS TALKING ABOUT? I MEAN, IS IS POSSIBLE? Jack:  VERY WELL COULD BE. JOHNNY WOULD BE FLOORED  IF HE WAS THERE TO SEE THAT. WE FOUND THIS BELL THAT HE SUSPECTED  WAS MADE OF BRONZE SMELTERED DOWN FROM  THE LAST INCAN CHIEF'S HOUSE, AND IT'S POSSIBLE, ACTUALLY, THAT THIS IS THE BELL  OF LA PLAZUELA. AND IT MEANT A LOT  TO THE PRIESTS. THE BELL  IS A VERY SYMBOLIC THING TO THE CHURCH  AND JESUITS, OBVIOUSLY. THE DOME REPRESENTS HEAVEN,  RIGHT, AND THEN THE LIP  REPRESENTS EARTH. AND WHENEVER IT'S BEING RUNG, IT'S LIKE THE VOICE OF GOD  CALLING EVERYONE TO PRAYER. FOR US, WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT  IS THAT IT'S SAYING THAT THE JESUITS  WERE MOVING THEIR HORDE RIGHT THROUGH THIS ARROYO. SO, WE NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN. WE NEED TO COVER EVERY INCH  OF THIS ARROYO. Jeremy: IT'S VERY POSSIBLE  THAT YOU GUYS FOUND THE PLAZUELA BELL, WHICH IS --  I MEAN, THAT'S INCREDIBLE. NOW WE'VE GOT TO RESUME  THE SEARCH OF THE CAVERN THAT YOU GUYS FOUND. TAKING A LINE  FROM OUR FIRST MARKERS, WHERE WE FOUND THE CHAINS, TO HERE, RIGHT AROUND  WHERE THIS BELL IS FOUND, THAT VERY CLEAR TRAJECTORY THAT'S GOING IN  A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION RIGHT TOWARDS THE VOID. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT  EVERYTHING'S LEADING TO THAT, SO WE'VE GOT TO GO  AND REALLY INVESTIGATE THAT. Jack: RIGHT, BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S JUST NOT AN OPTION RIGHT NOW. IT'S FULL OF BAT GUANO. IT'S BAD. YOU TASTE IT GOING IN,  YOU TASTE IT GOING OUT. YOU CAN HARDLY BREATHE  IN THERE. WE GOT TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SOLUTION. WE NEED TO FIGURE  SOMETHING OUT. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S NO WAY  WE COULD EXPLORE THAT CAVE OR WORK IN IT  WITH ALL THIS GUANO IN THERE, SO I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY  TO MAYBE VENTILATE IT OR OPEN IT UP FARTHER. THERE'S ALWAYS WIND  BLOWING THROUGH HERE. SO, MAYBE THERE'S SOME WAY  WE COULD CAPTURE IT OR GET IT TO ACTUALLY POSITIVELY PRESSURE THIS TUNNEL. I'VE GOT TO SLEEP ON IT. I THINK WE ALL GOT TO SLEEP  ON THIS ONE. ♪♪ ♪♪ Jeremy: WE NEED TO MOVE THAT AIR  IN THE CAVE, OTHERWISE WE CAN'T WORK DOWN THERE. BAT GUANO IS SO TOXIC,  ONE BREATH CAN TAKE YOU OUT. Jack: THE REAL DANGER'S  IN A CONDITION CALLED HISTOPLASMOSIS,  OR CAVE DISEASE. BEST CASE SCENARIO --  BAD COUGH. WORSE CASE -- PNEUMONIA,  RESPIRATORY FAILURE, EVEN SOMETHING  CALLED HEMORRHAGIC FEVER, WHERE ESSENTIALLY, YOU BLEED OUT OF YOUR NOSE AND YOUR MOUTH. IF WE GET HURT OR ILL OUT HERE,  THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE  EVERY PRECAUTION WE CAN TO CLEAR THAT TOXIC AIR. LOOK, I MEAN, WE SHOULD BE WEARING SPECIAL GAS MASKS TO GO DOWN THERE.  RIGHT. IF WE HEAD TO THE CITY  TO BUY THEM, THEN WE'LL LOSE TWO  TO THREE DAYS, AND WITH THE RAINS JUST AROUND THE CORNER, THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT. SO, MY IDEA IS TO MAKE  A BIG WIND SUCK. ACTUALLY TAKE THE AIR  UP HIGH AND FUNNEL IT  DOWN IN THERE. WE KNOW THERE'S A SMALL ENTRANCE SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THE BATS HAVE BEEN COMING IN AND OUT, AND IF WE CAN POSITIVE PRESSURE IT, WE CAN ACTUALLY GET IT TO VENTILATE. SO, TO SET UP  THE VENTILATION SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY VENTILATE  THIS TUNNEL, UNFORTUNATELY, WE'LL HAVE  TO DESTROY ONE OF OUR TENTS. WE'LL CUT THE BASE  AND THE TOP OFF THE TENT, FLIP THE TENT OVER, WE'LL TIE IT HIGH UP  TO THAT TREE. THE TENT IS GONNA ACT  LIKE A SAIL. IT'S GONNA CAPTURE THE WIND,  FUNNEL IT DOWN INTO THE TUNNEL, AND POSITIVELY PRESSURE IT. NOW THERE'S AN EXCESS OF AIR  BEING FORCED INTO THE CAVE, AND AIR IS HEAVIER THAN AMMONIA. AMMONIA IS THE MAIN GAS  THAT THIS GUANO'S GIVING OFF THAT'S MAKING US CHOKE UP. WHAT IT'S GONNA DO  IS FILL THE CAVE UP WITH THIS HEAVY AIR, AND THAT'S GONNA FORCE  THE AMMONIA, WHICH IS LIGHTER, UP AND OUT THE ENTRANCE. I'VE GOT ALMOST 100 FEET  OF PLASTIC GARBAGE BAGS. I MEAN, THAT'S 100 FEET  RIGHT THERE. SO, WE MAKE A FUNNEL, AND THE HIGHER WE GET IT,  THE MORE WIND WE CATCH. Shawn: IF YOU CAN GET IT UP  ABOVE THE CANOPY, MAYBE. Jack: LOOK AT THE TREES MOVE. THERE'S SOME WIND UP THERE. WELL... Shawn: ALL RIGHT,  LET'S DO IT, MAN. ♪♪ DUDE, IF THIS WORKS,  WE'LL PATENT IT. WELL, IF NOTHING ELSE, WE CAN USE IT  FOR A WATER SLIDE, RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, HOW WE LOOKING? Shawn: YOU KNOW, JEREMY  AND HIS HAREBRAINED IDEAS. THE CRAZY THING IS,  90% OF THEM WORK. READY TO PULL  THIS THING UP? ♪♪ Javier: READY TO PASS ME THE ROPE? ♪♪ Jeremy: YOU GUYS READY? Javier: OKAY, JEREMY. Shawn: LET'S GO UP.  WE'RE GOOD. ♪♪ -IT'S GOING.  -LOOK AT OUR AIR LINE. Jack: IT'S WORKING, BROTHER,  IT'S WORKING. -WHOO!  -HA-HA-HA! ♪♪ NICE JOB, MAN. Jeremy: OF COURSE  WE'LL ONLY COME TO KNOW IF THE PLAN REALLY WORKS  WHEN WE GO DOWN THERE. LET'S LET IT PUMP IN CLEAR AIR  ALL NIGHT AND COME BACK  IN THE MORNING. -GOOD JOB, GUYS.  -NICELY DONE. ♪♪ ♪♪ Jeremy: HOW DID WE GET THE [BLEEP] DUTY? Jack:  YEAH, I'M NOT SURE. THEY GET TO FIND  HISTORIC ARTIFACTS, AND WE GET BAT GUANO. Jeremy: THE VENTILATION SYSTEM  IS WORKING GREAT. I MEAN, IT'S BLOWING  THE AIR DOWN THERE. SO, NOW IT'S TIME  FOR US TO GO DOWN. FIRST THING AS WE GO DOWN,  RUN THE SNIFFER. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AIR  IS BREATHABLE. ♪♪ Jeremy: CAN YOU RUN THE SNIFFER? I CAN FEEL THE AIR  GOING PAST ME, WHICH MEANS THERE'S GOT TO BE AN OPENING DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE,  YOU KNOW? Jack:  IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER. I THINK WE'RE OKAY. I CAN STILL  SMELL THE GUANO, BUT IT'S NOT BAD.  YEAH. IT STILL STINKS,  BUT AT LEAST IT'S BREATHABLE. I CAN DEAL WITH THIS. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM. ♪♪ LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT. THAT IS A LOT OF GUANO. TEST THE AIR AS YOU'RE GOING BACK. OKAY. SO FAR SO GOOD. CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MANY BATS IT TOOK TO MAKE ALL THIS CRAP? THERE'S NO FRUIT BATS ANYWHERE AROUND HERE. IT'S ALL VAMPIRE BATS. SO, THIS IS BASICALLY,  JUST -- I MEAN, IT'S THEM  DRINKING BLOOD, DIGESTING BLOOD,  AND THEN -- CRAPPING IT OUT.  YUCK. UGH. HOW MANY GALLONS OF BLOOD DO YOU THINK IT TOOK TO MAKE ALL THIS? THAT NASTY TOXIC [BLEEP].  LITERALLY. [ WINGS FLAPPING ] GET DOWN! BATS. DAMN IT. -UGH!  -DUDE, TURN YOUR LIGHT DOWN. TURN YOUR LIGHT DOWN.  OKAY. ♪♪ Jeremy: YOU GUYS READY? Shawn: LET'S GO UP.  WE'RE GOOD. Narrator: THE TEAM SETS UP  A MASSIVE IMPROVISED WIND SOCK TO VENTILATE  THE TOXIC GUANO-FILLED CAVERN BENEATH THE ARROYO. -IT'S GOING.  -LOOK AT OUR AIR LINE. Jack: IT'S WORKING, BROTHER,  IT'S WORKING. Narrator:  BUT WHEN JEREMY AND JACK  REENTER THE CAVERN, THEY QUICKLY REALIZE THAT THOUGH  THE AIR QUALITY HAS IMPROVED, THE DANGER THAT PRODUCED THE GUANO IS STILL VERY PRESENT. Jeremy: GET DOWN! BATS. YOU HEAR THEM?  Jack: YES. THERE'S A [BLEEP]-LOAD OF BATS  IN HERE. -UGH!  -DUDE, TURN YOUR LIGHT DOWN. TURN YOUR LIGHT DOWN.  OKAY. I THINK WE GOT THEM OFF. VAMPIRE BATS ARE BAD NEWS. Narrator:  AS THEIR NAME SUGGESTS, VAMPIRE BATS  FEED ONLY ON BLOOD. LIKE SNAKES, THEY HAVE INFRARED SENSORS  ON THEIR SNOUTS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HONE IN ON BLOOD HOTSPOTS ON THEIR PREY. WHEN THEY BITE DOWN WITH THEIR  OVERSIZED RAZOR-LIKE TEETH, THEY CAN CONSUME AS MUCH AS HALF  THEIR OWN WEIGHT IN BLOOD IN ONE FEEDING SESSION. DON'T GET BIT. DUDE, THIS WHOLE VALLEY, I MEAN, THERE'S VAMPIRE BATS  IN THIS REGION. I MEAN, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. I THINK WE LIT UP  A POCKET OF THEM. AND WHEN YOU LIGHT THEM UP, THEY'LL FLY RIGHT AT YOUR FACE. DO WE KILL OUR LIGHTS,  OR WHAT? NO, JUST KEEP THEM LOW. IF YOU DON'T PUT THE SPOTLIGHT  RIGHT ON THEM, THEY WON'T FLY. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] COME ON.  LET'S FINISH THIS. KEEP YOUR EYE ON ANYTHING,  JACK. I MEAN, ANYTHING YOU SEE AT ALL. I MEAN, LITTLE NICHES.  ALL RIGHT. ♪♪ ♪♪ TEST THE AIR FOR ME,  JACK. IT'S BETTER  THAN LAST TIME. I THINK  WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY. Jeremy: I DON'T SEE ANYTHING  THAT INDICATES JESUITS OR ANY HUMAN WAS IN HERE. Jack: I AGREE. Jeremy: IT'S POSSIBLE  THAT THE JESUITS -- IF THEY MOVED THE TREASURE OVER  THE TOP OF US IN THE ARROYO, THEN MAYBE THEY DIDN'T KNOW  ABOUT THE VOID. Jack: MAN, YOU THINK THERE'D BE SOMETHING DOWN HERE. IT'S SUCH A GOOD PLACE  TO HIDE SOMETHING. Jeremy: REALLY SEARCH THE [BLEEP] OUT OF IT. DON'T PASS ANYTHING UP. ♪♪ ♪♪ JACK. THAT'S IT. ANOTHER WALL. IT LOOKS JUST ROCK. UGH. [BLEEP]. LOOKS LIKE WE SEARCHED  IT GOOD, BUT... THIS IS NATURAL. I THINK IT WAS CUT BY WATER RUNNING UNDERNEATH  THE ARROYO. JUST BATS AND GUANO  DOWN HERE. ♪♪ Jeremy:  THERE IS NO CHISEL MARKS, NO DRILL MARKS,  FALSE WALLS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE BASICALLY  AT A DEAD END WITH THIS PLACE. FRUSTRATING. BUT YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO  WHEN YOU'RE DOWN HERE AND I GUESS JUST BE  AS TENACIOUS AS HELL. YOU KNOW, KEEP SEARCHING. ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: THE TEAM CROSSES OUT  THE NATURAL CAVERN AND HONES IN  ON THE REMAINDER OF THE ARROYO. GRIDDING THE ENTIRE AREA INTO  SECTIONS OF 10 SQUARE FEET, THEY DEPLOY  THE GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR, MAGNETOMETER,  AND METAL DETECTORS TO SEARCH THE DRIED UP RIVERBED  FROM END TO END. -ANY HITS YET?  -NO. Narrator:  BUT THEIR TWO-DAY HUNT LEADS TO NO FURTHER  DISCOVERIES. Shawn: OH, I THINK  WE'RE BATTING ZERO. THERE'S NOTHING HERE.  UGH. ♪♪ I MEAN, WE'VE COVERED EVERY INCH  OF THIS ARROYO. WE'RE DEAD HERE. Jeremy:  WE SEARCHED IT OUT. I MEAN, WE HAD  A DEFINITIVE LINE FOR A WHILE THERE, AND THEN IT JUST ENDED. THE TREASURE OBVIOUSLY  MOVED THROUGH HERE. IT JUST DIDN'T STAY HERE. AND IF IT'S NOT HERE, THEN WHERE THE HELL  DID THEY TAKE IT? I MEAN, WHAT DO WE KNOW SO FAR? WE KNOW THE TREASURE  IS MOVING IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION,  RIGHT? -RIGHT.  -FROM LA PLAZUELA TO THE TUNNEL TO THE ARROYO TO SOMEWHERE OUT THERE. SO, WHAT LANDMARKS OUT THERE WOULD MAKE THE PERFECT HIDING SPOT IN THIS AREA? ANYTHING THAT STICKS OUT  NORTHEAST OF HERE. TOMORROW, JEREMY, WHY DON'T YOU FIRE UP THE DRONE? I WANT TO SEE WHAT LIES A FEW MILES UP AHEAD. WELL, HOPE WE'RE NOT PISSING IN THE WIND. Shawn:  WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY LANDMARK  THAT'S EITHER VERY SECLUDED AND CUT OFF FROM  THE REST OF THE LANDSCAPE OR BEARING A VERY  DISTINCTIVE FEATURE THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASILY  IDENTIFIABLE FROM AFAR. OF COURSE,  THIS IS A MASSIVE AREA, SO THE DRONE -- IT'LL GIVE US A BIRD'S-EYE  VIEW OF THE LANDSCAPE SO YOU CAN COVER MORE AREA  IN A LESSER AMOUNT OF TIME. AND, OF COURSE, THE DRONE AND ALL THE OTHER  HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT WE HAVE -- WE HAVE TO PUT  ALL OF THESE TOOLS TO USE IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE  A SHOT AT SUCCEEDING WHERE ALL THE OTHERS FAILED. ♪♪ Shawn:  THIS IS REALLY MY FIRST TIME  LEADING A MAJOR EXPEDITION. GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE  COUNTING ON ME. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY. RUNNING OUT OF PROVISIONS. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. IF I GO HOME EMPTY-HANDED... [ SIGHS ] ...I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. EVERYBODY SACRIFICED  A LOT TO BE HERE. IF THIS DRONE SEARCH DOESN'T  LEAD TO A VIABLE LOCATION, WE'RE GONNA SLAM  RIGHT INTO A DEAD END. SO, OBVIOUSLY, A LOT'S  RIDING ON TOMORROW. ♪♪ ♪♪ -BOY, THAT WIND IS ROCKING.  -PRETTY WINDY. [ WIND WHISTLING ] -YOU GUYS READY?  -READY. Jack: [ CHUCKLES ] ♪♪ Jeremy: I NEED TO SPOT  ANY INTRIGUING LANDMARKS NORTHEAST OF HERE. IT WOULD BE VERY DISTINCT  FROM ITS SURROUNDINGS -- YOU KNOW,  STEEP HILL, CAVE -- WHATEVER WE CAN SEE AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO UP  A LITTLE BIT HIGHER SO WE CAN SEE -- WE CAN SEE  A LITTLE BIT MORE. ALL RIGHT. RIGHT THERE -- A RIVER COMING UP  ON THE RIGHT. WHAT IS THAT?  [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Javier: THAT'S, UH,  [SPEAKING SPANISH] Shawn: BOY, IT'S THICK. I'M GONNA GO FORWARD  A LITTLE BIT. ♪♪ I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. I DON'T SEE ANOTHER ARROYO,  NO CAVE OR CAVERN, AND NO LANDMARK THAT'LL GRAB  YOUR ATTENTION FROM FAR. LET ME GO UP HIGHER.  -YEAH. Shawn: STAY FAR AWAY  FROM THOSE TREES. Jeremy: WAIT. WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.  HANG ON. DO YOU SEE THAT, SHAWN? THERE'S THREE RIVERS  RIGHT THERE. ♪♪ Shawn: THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE  THIS DELTA HERE. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A MIRROR IMAGE OF THIS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. Jack: YEAH. GET A WAYPOINT. Jeremy: YEAH, MAKE SURE  WE MARK THAT, FOR SURE. Shawn: ANOTHER THREE RIVERS -- WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT? ♪♪ WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.  GO BACK. DO YOU SEE THAT?

Jeremy: A FLAT-TOPPED HILL  NEXT TO THREE RIVERS -- I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT ALL THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS POINTED TO. -THAT'S IT!  -YES! Jeremy: PLATEAU. ♪♪ [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] -YOU GUYS READY?  -READY. Narrator: WHEN THE TEAM  DEPLOYS A DRONE TO SEARCH  FOR LIKELY HIDING SPOTS NORTHEAST  OF THE ARROYO... Shawn: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.  GO BACK. DID YOU SEE THAT? ...THEY SPOT A FLAT-TOPPED HILL THAT MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION MENTIONED  IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE TREASURE'S  RESTING PLACE. Jeremy: THERE IT IS.  THERE'S A PLATEAU. FLAT SPOT, YEP. BIG FLAT SPOT  RIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE HILL. Javier: RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT THERE. Shawn:  WELL, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT? THERE'S A CONFLUENCE  OF THREE RIVERS AND WE FOUND ANOTHER MOUNTAIN  WITH A PLATEAU ON IT. I MEAN, THAT'S EXACTLY  WHAT THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT WAS TALKING ABOUT. Narrator: THE LEGEND  OF THE SACAMBAYA TREASURE IS BASED ON A DOCUMENT WRITTEN BY A JESUIT PRIEST  OF LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY KNOWN AS  THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT. IT STATES THAT NEAR  THE CONFLUENCE OF THREE RIVERS FLOWING THROUGH  THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY, THERE LIES A FLAT-TOPPED HILL. ON TOP OF THIS HILL  SITS A HUGE EGG-SHAPED ROCK. AND SOMEWHERE BELOW THIS ROCK  IS AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER THAT CONTAINS A MASSIVE HOARD  OF GOLD AND SILVER ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH  $2 BILLION. ALL PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS  HAD ASSUMED THE DOCUMENT WAS REFERRING TO CABALLO CUNCA,  A FLAT-TOPPED HILL LOCATED A FEW MILES  FROM LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY. BUT SHAWN'S EXPEDITION HAS DISCOVERED  ANOTHER FLAT-TOPPED HILL NEXT TO A NEW CONFLUENCE  OF THREE RIVERS THAT LIES SEVERAL MILES NORTHEAST OF LA PLAZUELA  MONASTERY. Jeremy: THAT COULD BE IT.  I MEAN, IT'S -- THERE'S A THREE-RIVER JUNCTION,  PLATEAU, WE JUST GOT TO FIND  THE EGG-SHAPED ROCK. ♪♪ Shawn: DO YOU SEE THE ROCK? I DON'T KNOW YET. I DON'T SEE IT. MAYBE WE'RE TOO FAR AWAY. CAN YOU GET  IN A LITTLE CLOSER? MNH-MNH. MY BATTERIES  ARE GETTING LOW, I GOT TO BRING IT BACK. WE'RE JUST MISSING  ONE THING. Shawn:  BUT WE STILL HAVE THREE RIVERS MEETING UP RIGHT NEXT  TO A FLAT-TOPPED HILL, THAT'S TOO MUCH  OF A COINCIDENCE. DEFINITELY WORTH  INVESTIGATING MORE. Jeremy: YEAH. ♪♪ THAT EGG-SHAPED ROCK,  DIDN'T FIND IT ON THE DRONE, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT --  TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD. AND WHAT'S REALLY GOT ME ABUZZ IS THAT THE BALLASEYA MARKINGS SAID THAT THE SYMBOLS  FOR THE ORIGIN AND THE DESTINATION  OF THE PACKAGE WERE THE SAME. ALL THIS TIME WE THOUGHT  THAT THAT MEANT THE PACKAGE WAS SHIPPED  FROM LA PLAZUELA TO A PLACE VERY CLOSE TO IT,  LIKE THE ARROYO. BUT WHAT WE'VE JUST SEEN  ON THE DRONE COULD MEAN THAT THE PACKAGE  WAS SHIPPED FROM ONE THREE RIVERS LOCATION TO ANOTHER  NEARLY IDENTICAL LOCATION. AND THAT IF WE FIND  THAT EGG-SHAPED ROCK, IT COULD BE  A SERIOUS GAME-CHANGER. ALL RIGHT, GUYS.  WE GOT TO GO IN THERE AND SEE IF THERE'S ACTUALLY  AN EGG-SHAPED ROCK THERE. NO HALF STEPPING.  LET'S GET UP AND GO. Jack:  WE GOT A HELL OF A HIKE. [ THUNDER RUMBLES,  RAIN FALLING ] ♪♪ Shawn: FINAL PUSH. ♪♪ IN JUST A MATTER OF TIME, ALL OF THESE HILLS  WILL BE FULL OF WATERFALLS AND THIS VALLEY  WILL BE FILLING WITH WATER. Javier:  ONCE IT STARTS RAINING,  IT FLOODS. Jeremy: SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FLASH-FLOOD SCENARIO? FLASH FLOOD.  [BLEEP] Shawn:  GUYS, CHECK IT OUT. DOES THAT LOOK LIKE A WALL  TO YOU? ♪♪ Jack: LOOKS LIKE NATURAL EROSION, BUT IT WOULD TAKE  ONE HELL OF A FLOOD TO CUT A WALL LIKE THIS. YOU THINK THE WATER IS GONNA GO UP 20 FEET LIKE THIS? -YES.  -WE'D BE TRAPPED. ♪♪ Javier:  THE RAINY SEASON'S COMING UP AND THE RIVER IS GETTING  MORE AND MORE WATER EVERY DAY. IT'LL BE CRAZY FAST. WE'RE REALLY WORRIED BECAUSE ALL  THE PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN  FOR THAT SAME REASON, FOR THE RAIN. SO THIS NEW LOCATION  BETTER BE THE RIGHT ONE. WE NEED TO RETRIEVE  THIS TREASURE QUICKLY AND GET THE HELL OUT  REALLY FAST. ♪♪ [ WATER SPLASHING ] Javier:  IF WE THOUGHT THE SACAMBAYA WAS IN THE MIDDLE  OF NOWHERE, THIS IS LIKE -- I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A PLACE  LIKE THIS. THERE'S NOTHING AROUND,  MAN. NO ROADS, NOTHING. PHEW. GUYS... THAT WAYPOINT YOU TOOK  WITH THE DRONE? WE'RE REALLY CLOSE. SEE THAT VALLEY RIGHT THERE  BETWEEN THE TWO MOUNTAINS? THAT'S THE THIRD RIVER. ♪♪ Shawn: YEAH. IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT'S OUR HILL RIGHT THERE,  THAT'S OUR TWIN. Narrator:  AFTER A SEVEN-HOUR HIKE, THE TEAM FINALLY ARRIVES AT ITS NORTHEASTERLY  DESTINATION -- A NEW FLAT-TOPPED HILL NEAR ANOTHER CONFLUENCE  OF THREE RIVERS. ♪♪ Jeremy:  DAMN, THAT'S STEEP. Shawn: ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES, BOYS, WE'RE HEADING UP THE HILL. Jack:  ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT. READY? ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE. Shawn:  THIS IS A BRAND-NEW AREA. IT'S AN AREA THAT NOBODY ELSE  HAS LOOKED AT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT  WHEN WE GET UP THERE. COULD THIS BE  THE FLAT-TOPPED HILL WITH THE EGG-SHAPED ROCK MENTIONED  IN THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT? OR COULD THIS BE JUST  ANOTHER PLATEAU IN THE VALLEY? THIS CLIMB HAS A LOT AT STAKE. Jeremy: THERE YOU GO. COME ON. ♪♪ THIS IS VIRGIN TURF, MAN.

Shawn: VERY STRATEGIC. YOU COULD SEE ANYBODY  FOR MILES COMING IN HERE. LOOKS THE SAME,  IT'S JUST HARDER TO GET TO. THERE'S ONLY  ONE THING MISSING COMPARED TO  THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT. THE EGG-SHAPED ROCK. LIKE A GIANT EASTER EGG HUNT, HUH? LET'S SPREAD OUT, PUT OUR EYES  ALL OVER THIS HILL, FIND THAT ROCK. -ALL RIGHT.  -LET'S DO IT. ♪♪ ♪♪ Shawn: NOTHING HERE. ANY LUCK? Jeremy: THERE'S NOTHING. Javier: LET'S GO AROUND THERE. Shawn: GUYS!  Jeremy: HUH? GUYS, COME HERE! WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? YOU SEE WHAT I SEE? ♪♪ LOOK AT THAT. BIG ROCK. LITTLE PIECES OF ROCK. IT'S BEEN SHATTERED. ♪♪ COULD THAT BE THE ROCK  WE'RE LOOKING FOR? ♪♪ -TOP OF THE WORLD, MAN.  -THE PLATEAU. Shawn: THERE IT IS, GUYS. OH, YEAH,  THAT'S A FLAT TOP. Narrator:  HAVING REACHED THE NEWLY  DISCOVERED FLAT-TOPPED HILL, THE TEAM SEARCHES THE PLATEAU  FOR AN EGG-SHAPED ROCK, THE FINAL GEOGRAPHICAL LANDMARK MENTIONED IN  THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT TO DESCRIBE  THE TREASURE'S RESTING PLACE. Shawn: LOOK AT THAT. COULD THAT BE THE ROCK  WE'RE LOOKING FOR? ♪♪ Jeremy: WELL, LET'S GET AT IT, MAN. Shawn: THIS MASSIVE ROCK,  IT'S COMPLETELY BALD. THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY REAL SCRUB  OR LITTLE TREES AROUND. IT WAS JUST A BIG, FLAT TOP -- THIS HUGE FORMATION  IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PLATEAU. IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE  IN THIS AREA. LOOK AT THE PIECES  AROUND IT. I MEAN, IT SEEMS TO ME THIS COULD HAVE EASILY  COME APART NATURALLY. YEAH. IT FREEZES AND THAWS AND FREEZES AND THAWS  UP HERE. WATER, TEMPERATURE,  PRESSURE. Jack: CRACKS. THERE'S A BIG FISSURE  RIGHT HERE. YEAH. YOU LOOK AT THE ROCKS AROUND IT, I BET WE COULD PUT IT BACK TOGETHER LIKE A JIGSAW PUZZLE. LOOK AT THAT. I MEAN, THAT -- THAT JUST  PROBABLY RECENTLY FELL OFF. YEP. I MEAN, IF THESE PIECES  WERE ALL ONCE ATTACHED TO THIS, YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE  THIS WAS ONE MASSIVE ROCK. YEAH. Jeremy:  IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, TOO, IT'S ALL BACKLIT  WITH GREEN. YOU KNOW, IT STANDS OUT  LIKE A SORE THUMB. I MEAN,  THIS IS A LANDMARK THAT WOULD STAND  THE TEST OF TIME. WE'RE TALKING  THOUSANDS OF YEARS, THEY ALWAYS USED BIG STONES. Narrator: THE DISCOVERY  OF THIS MASSIVE ROCK CHECKS OFF THE FINAL LANDMARK LISTED ON THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT TO DESCRIBE THE TREASURE'S  FINAL LOCATION. NOW THE TEAM NEEDS TO CONFIRM IF THE REST  OF THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS ABOUT A MASSIVE FORTUNE  HIDDEN BENEATH THIS ROCK IS ALSO ACCURATE. Shawn:  THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT SAYS WHAT WE SHOULD BE FINDING  UNDER THIS EGG-SHAPED ROCK IS A CEILING AND THEN AN ENTRANCE  INTO A BIG CAVERN UNDERNEATH, WHICH IS WHERE $2 BILLION WORTH  OF TREASURE'S GONNA BE STORED. AND LUCKILY, WITH OUR EQUIPMENT,  WE CAN QUICKLY DETERMINE VOIDS. SO HOPEFULLY,  WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY FROM FINDING THIS LABYRINTH  UNDERNEATH THIS MASSIVE ROCK. JEREMY, I THINK YOU AND I  SHOULD DO THE RESISTIVITY, AND I WANT TO START  RIGHT HERE. YEAH. AND IF YOU GUY WILL DO  THE GROUND PENETRATING RADAR, MAYBE START UP AT THE OTHER END  OF THE PLATEAU AND WORK TOWARDS US, AND LET'S SEE  IF WE CAN FIND A VOID. ♪♪ OKAY, WE'RE CONNECTED AT ONE. ALL RIGHT, FIRING. Jeremy: SO IF THERE'S NOTHING  UNDERNEATH US, WE SHOULD GET  CONSISTENT NUMBERS. 59.76. Shawn:  THAT'S OUR BASELINE. WE'RE LOOKING  FOR BIG NUMBERS. OKAY, I'M MOVING UP  TO NUMBER TWO. ALL RIGHT, FIRING. 59.66.  OKAY. WELL,  THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT. WE WERE READING DOWN  PROBABLY 20, 30 FEET AND WE GOT NOTHING. JEREMY, DID YOU HEAR  THAT THUNDER? YEAH. I HOPE IT FRICKIN' HITS  ON THIS ONE. 66.95. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] MAN. THERE'S NO TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THIS ROCK. Shawn:  EVERYTHING WE'RE FINDING HERE IS JUST ALL THE MISSING  PIECES TO THE PUZZLE, BUT WE HAVEN'T FOUND  THE TUNNEL BELOW THE ROCK LIKE THE DOCUMENT SAID, BUT MAYBE THE DOCUMENT  DIDN'T MEAN DIRECTLY BELOW  THE EGG-SHAPED ROCK. MAYBE IT MEANT JUST  SOMEWHERE BELOW THE PLATEAU IN GENERAL, YOU KNOW? OF COURSE THAT MEANS WE HAVE  A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER AND THAT OUR JOB  HAS JUST BECOME A LOT HARDER. LET'S JUST START AT THE EDGE  OF THE PLATEAU AND WORK BACK THIS WAY  AND JUST KEEP RUNNING LINES. LET'S DO IT. IT'S GOT TO BE HERE. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ]  FRICKIN' RAIN, THOUGH. Narrator: AFTER FIVE HOURS, THE TEAM HAS COMPLETED  THE UNDERGROUND INVESTIGATION OF THE SOUTHERN  AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE PLATEAU... -ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING?  -UH. NOTHING YET. Javier: NOT ONE SINGLE HIT, MAN.  NOTHING. Narrator:  ...AND WILL NOW PROBE THE NORTHERN-MOST TIP  OF THE HILL. ♪♪ Shawn:  THIS IS THE HIGHEST POINT. NOW WE'RE AT THE TIP-TOP  OF THIS PLATEAU. THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. Jeremy:  CENTER PIN RIGHT HERE. IT'S GETTING VERY LATE  IN THE DAY, SO I'M GETTING  MORE AND MORE ANXIOUS. WE HAVE GOT TO GET  SOME GOOD LINES ON THIS RESISTIVITY AND FIND SOMETHING SOON. ALL RIGHT. FIRING UP. ♪♪ 86.95. COPY. ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE  GONNA MOVE 'EM OUT. -LOCK IS IN.  -CLEAR. ALL RIGHT, FIRING. ♪♪ 109, JACK.  OKAY. MOVE IT BACK OUT  2 1/2 MORE. ♪♪ LOCK IS CONNECTED  AND CLEAR. Jack: CLEAR HERE. ALL RIGHT, FIRING. ♪♪ 237.4,  WE GOT OUR TUNNEL! [BLEEP] YAY. -237.4.  -YES! Shawn: THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE. GOOD JOB.  GOOD JOB. -WHOO!  -NICELY DONE. SO WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS. NOW WE NEED  VISUAL CONFIRMATION. I NEED TO CONFIRM  ON THE 3-D RECEIVER THAT THIS IS  A GENUINE VOID OR TUNNEL AND NOT JUST SOME SORT  OF ACCIDENTAL ABERRATION THAT THE RESISTIVITY METER  DETECTED. THREE, TWO, ONE. [BLEEP]  AH, THERE IT IS. MAN... LOOK AT THAT! THAT IS A BIG TUNNEL. THAT IS HUGE, MAN. ♪♪ YOU CAN FIT $2 BILLION  IN A TUNNEL THAT SIZE. ♪♪ Jeremy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hawn: YOU CAN FIT $2 BILLION  IN A TUNNEL THAT SIZE. Jack: WOW! THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN AFTER  FOR MONTHS. ♪♪ Shawn: WE GOT A VOID. UM, CONSIDERABLY DEEPER  THAN WE HAD EXPECTED, BUT WE GOT A VOID. THE PROBLEM IS, WE DON'T HAVE  A LOT OF TIME LEFT HERE. I MEAN, IT'S BEEN RAINING  THE WHOLE TIME. I KNOW WE'RE PUSHING OUR LUCK. IT'S RAINING RIGHT NOW.  I MEAN -- THERE YOU GO. WE'RE ABOUT TO GET  RAINED OUT HERE. SO WE NEED TO GET  INTO THIS TUNNEL, CONFIRM THAT WE HAVE  WHAT WE CAME LOOKING FOR, AND GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE  WE'RE TRAPPED BY THE RAIN. Jeremy: THAT'S 36 FEET DEEP. IF WE HAD SUCH A BIG SIGNATURE,  AND IT'S THIS DEEP, THERE'S NO WAY  WE'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS WITH SHOVELS AND PICKS. WE GOT TO BRING IN SOME HEAVY EQUIPMENT UP HERE. YOU THINK WE CAN GET  AN EXCAVATOR UP HERE? Jack: WE'RE GONNA NEED TO. I MEAN, IT'S ALL FLAT  RIGHT HERE. ♪♪ SO, I WAS THINKING,  "HOW THE HELL ARE WE GONNA GET SOME EQUIPMENT IN HERE  TO BE ABLE TO DIG THIS OUT?" FORTUNATELY, IT LOOKS  LIKE FURTHER NORTH HERE, THE SLOPE'S PRETTY GENTLE, BUT MY GUESS IS  THAT THIS IS THE PATH THAT THE JESUITS AND HUNDREDS  OF INDIGENOUS WORKERS WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO HAUL UP  ALL THOSE DIGGING TOOLS AND, OF COURSE,  A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF TREASURE. ♪♪ JAVI, JACK,  WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO OUT, SEE IF YOU CAN  FIGURE OUT A PLAN TO GET THE EXCAVATOR  UP HERE. WE NEED TO GO BACK DOWN, JEREMY,  BREAK DOWN OUR CAMP. TOMORROW,  GET EVERYTHING UP HERE, SET UP A NEW BASE CAMP  RIGHT HERE. GROUND ZERO. WE GOT TO MOVE, TOO,  WE GOT CLOUDS MOVING IN. -YEAH.  -I CAN FEEL IT. ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: AT FIRST LIGHT, JAVIER AND JACK  TAKE UP THE CHALLENGE OF NAVIGATING THE EXCAVATOR THROUGH SEVERAL MILES  OF HARSH TERRAIN FROM THEIR BASE CAMP  NEAR LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY TO THE NEW FLAT-TOPPED HILL WHERE THE TEAM HAS DETECTED  A HUGE TUNNEL. ONCE THEY REACH THIS LOCATION, THEY WILL ATTEMPT  DESCENDING THE HILL FROM THE NORTHERN SIDE, WHICH HAS A MORE GRADUAL  AND ACCESSIBLE INCLINE. ♪♪ Jack: JUST BRING IT  RIGHT THROUGH HERE. Jack: YOU KNOW,  IT'S EASY TO SAY, WELL, WE'RE GONNA BRING UP  A BIG EXCAVATOR AND DIG A 30-FOOT HOLE," BUT THE DEVIL'S  IN THE DETAILS, RIGHT? THE TRACKS ARE ABOUT  18 FEET WIDE, THIS PATH  IS BARELY THAT WIDE. IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY. Narrator: AS JACK AND JAVIER SLOWLY MAKE THEIR WAY  THROUGH THE RUGGED LANDSCAPE, SHAWN AND JEREMY SET UP CAMP  AT THEIR DIG SITE. Jeremy:  I MEAN, FIRST TIME I READ ABOUT  THE TREASURE OF SACAMBAYA I WAS 16,  AND HERE WE ARE, YOU KNOW? I GOT TO PINCH MYSELF  EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. Shawn: A LOT OF THESE  LOST TREASURES, PEOPLE CAN'T REALLY GRASP  THAT THEY COULD BE REAL, IT'S ALMOST TOO BIG  OF A FANTASY. Jeremy: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE  FOR MY MENTOR, MEL FISHER. I'M PROUD TO HAVE BEEN  A KEY MEMBER FOR MEL FISHER, ONE OF THE GREATEST  TREASURE HUNTERS IN THE WORLD. I MEAN,  HE LOOKED FOR 16 YEARS FOR THE MOTHER LODE  OF THE ATOCHA. THROUGH THAT WHOLE TIME, HE WOULD NEVER  LET IT GET HIM DOWN THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT  HE WAS FULL OF IT. IN FACT, HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY,  "TODAY'S THE DAY," YOU KNOW. AND IT PAID OFF. THE ATOCHA IS, STILL TODAY, CONSIDERED TO BE THE WORLD'S  GREATEST UNDERWATER TREASURE, RIGHT AT $450 MILLION. WELL, I JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T TAKE 16 YEARS, SHAWN. [ LAUGHS ] I HAVE A FEELING  IT'S GONNA BE A... [ HORN BLOWS IN DISTANCE ] YOU HEAR THAT?  YEAH. [ HORN BLOWS IN DISTANCE ] YES. ♪♪ -YOU MADE IT.  -YOU GUYS. Jack: CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT  AN EXCAVATOR UP HERE. JUST INCREDIBLE. IT'S GONNA REACH,  RIGHT, GUYS? THE REACH IS GONNA BE CLOSE,  BUT IT SHOULD WORK. WE DON'T KNOW THE MAKEUP OF THIS MOUNTAIN ENTIRELY, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S GONNA BE SIMILAR TO THE OTHER HILLS WE WORKED AROUND LA PLAZUELA -- A LAYER OF TOPSOIL FOR THE FIRST 10 FEET OR SO AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HIT BEDROCK. WE CAN USE THE BUCKET  WHERE WE CAN AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT THE JACKHAMMER ON AND BREAK THROUGH THE ROCK UNTIL WE GET DEEP ENOUGH  TO HIT THAT TUNNEL. JACK, DO YOU WANT TO MARK  THE "X"? GROUND ZERO RIGHT HERE. Javier:  LET'S START DIGGING. ♪♪ Shawn:  NOW LET'S HOPE IT'S MOSTLY DIRT UNTIL WE GET TO OUR CEILING. ♪♪ THAT WIND'S BLOWING  EVERY WHICH DIRECTION. Jeremy: HOT DIGGITY DOG. Jeremy: NOW, WE GOT  A FRONT COMING IN. IT'S NOT GOOD. Shawn:  THAT'S A BIG CHUNK OF ROCK. Jeremy: YEAH, IT IS.  IT'S GETTING ROCKY. BIGGER ROCKS NOW. Jack:  YOU HEAR THAT SCRAPING? WE'RE ON A SHEET OF BEDROCK. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TIME  TO GET THAT HAMMER OUT AND BUST THROUGH. Jack: ON THE EXCAVATOR, IT HAS THAT LONG FRONT ARM  WITH A BUCKET, AND IT'S KIND OF  A DUAL-PURPOSE RIG. WE CAN PULL THAT BUCKET OFF AND ACTUALLY ATTACH  THE HYDRAULIC HAMMER DRILL ONTO THE EXCAVATOR. THERE WE GO. LET'S GET TO WORK,  GUYS. [ RATTLING ] Jeremy:  SLOW AND EASY, JAV. [ RATTLING ] Shawn: HOW'S IT LOOKING  OVER THERE, JACK? SO FAR SO GOOD. [ RATTLING ] -WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!  -IS THAT A HOLE? Jeremy: WE GOT A HOLE. JAV, WE GOT A HOLE!  PULL OUT! Jack: LOOK AT THAT! Shawn:  BEFORE WE JUST JUMP DOWN, WE MIGHT HAVE SOME GASES  TO DEAL WITH HERE. SO WE GOT TO TAKE THIS  SLOW AND EASY. JACK,  GET THAT SNIFFER READY. ALL RIGHT, JEREMY.  YOU READY FOR THIS? Jeremy: I'VE BEEN READY FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS, MAN. -GOOD TO GO, MAN.  -ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS. GOT ME, JACK?  Jack: I GOT YOU. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT.  GIVE ME THE LINE.
