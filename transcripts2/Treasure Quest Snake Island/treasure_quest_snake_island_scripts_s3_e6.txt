 [ COUGHS, GROANS ] [ BEEPING CONTINUES ] ♪♪ Narrator: A COLOSSAL HOARD  OF GOLD IS RUMORED TO BE HIDDEN IN A REMOTE VALLEY  IN WESTERN BOLIVIA. OVER THE LAST THREE CENTURIES, HUNDREDS HAVE DIED  FOR THIS LEGENDARY TREASURE THAT COULD BE WORTH  OVER $2 BILLION. ♪♪ NOW A BRAVE GROUP  OF TREASURE HUNTERS... -THIS IS THE SPOT.  -...ARMED WITH A NEW LEAD...

[ BEEPS ] ...AFTER FINDING VALUABLE  JESUIT ARTIFACTS IN AND AROUND THE ANCIENT TUNNEL NEAR LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY... THAT IS DEFINITELY SILVER. THIS GOLD CLOTH, IT'S ACTUALLY  MADE FROM GOLD BULLION. Narrator: ...THE TEAM'S  UNDERGROUND SEARCH CAME TO A SUDDEN STANDSTILL. END OF THE LINE. MAYBE THESE TUNNELS WERE BEING  DUG TO BRING IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. Narrator:  FOLLOWING THE CLUES THAT THEY COLLECTED  INSIDE THE TUNNEL... THE BALE SEAL TELLS ME  THESE PACKAGES, THEY WERE MEANT TO BE TRANSPORTED  SOMEWHERE FURTHER AWAY. ...AND HEEDING THE ADVICE OF VETERAN TREASURE HUNTER  JOHNNY ERWIN... I think something's  buried there. Narrator: ...THEY REALIGN THEIR  SEARCH TO AN ISOLATED ARROYO, NORTHEAST OF THE MONASTERY... THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME CHAIN  JOHNNY FOUND. WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH. ...AND SHAWN AND JAVIER  TRAVEL TO LA PAZ TO MEET AN ARCHAEOLOGIST  WHO MIGHT HELP DECIPHER THE CRYPTIC SHIPPING INFORMATION  IMPRINTED ON THE BALE SEAL. YOU SEE THERE ARE  SOME LINES HERE. ONE IS "ORIGIN." THE OTHER ONE IS "DESTINATION." ♪♪ ♪♪ SO A BALE SEAL IS TELLING US  THESE THREE SQUIGGLY LINES WITH A LINE THROUGH IT IS COMING  TOGETHER AT THREE RIVERS? -YES.  -HMM. Shawn: WHEN GONZALO SUGGESTED  THAT THE THREE SQUIGGLY LINES COULD BE THE MEETING  OF THREE RIVERS, IT TOLD ME, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THIS IS A JESUIT PIECE  CONNECTED TO LA PLAZUELA. AND JUST GOING BY  THE ROMAN NUMERALS ON THE OBVERSE SIDE  OF THIS BALE SEAL, IT REPRESENTS  A MASSIVE SHIPMENT. DO YOU THINK THAT  THE RIVERS REPRESENT THE POINT OF ORIGIN  OR WHERE IT'S GOING? WELL... ...AND THAT'S  INTRIGUING ME, TOO, 'CAUSE IF IT'S A SHIPMENT, THEY WILL HAVE TWO SYMBOLS -- ONE OF THE ORIGIN AND ONE OF THE DESTINATION, BUT THAT IS CONFUSING ME 'CAUSE IT'S THE SAME SYMBOL FOR ORIGIN AND DESTINATION. IT'S DUPLICATE SYMBOLS. THE SAME ORIGIN,  SAME DESTINATION. IT MAKES NO LOGIC. UNLESS THESE PACKAGES  WERE GOING TO STAY THERE. THAT COULD BE THE LOGIC,  OR I'M SPECULATING, BUT MAYBE THE DESTINATION  OF THE SHIPMENT? IT WAS CLOSE TO THE ORIGIN. Shawn: HMM.  ANOTHER AREA, MAYBE? NEAR THE CONFLUENCE  OF THREE RIVERS? RIGHT. THE ARCHAEOLOGIST'S IMPRESSION  OF THE DIFFERENT MARKINGS ON THE BALE SEAL  IS THAT THE POINT OF ORIGIN AND THE POINT OF DESTINATION,  IF YOU WILL, WERE MIRRORED. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE GOLD  WAS ACTUALLY MOVED FROM A LOCATION NEAR THREE RIVERS,  WHICH IS THE TUNNEL, TO ANOTHER LOCATION  NEAR THREE RIVERS. SO IN SOME WAYS, I'M EVEN MORE INTRIGUED ABOUT THE ARROYO. AN OLD RIVER BED THAT WAS  NOT TOO FAR FROM LA PLAZUELA, THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE  GOING TO BRING IT. MAYBE THE ARROYO IS IT.  I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS WE JUST, WE GOTTA  GO TO KNOW, YOU KNOW? BUT THE THING THAT'S STILL  PUZZLING IS, YOU KNOW,  HAVING DUPLICATE SYMBOLS ON ANY EMBLEM BY THE JESUITS, IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. THEY DON'T DO THAT. WE'LL HAVE TO JUST KEEP DIGGING AND FIGURING OUT WHAT  THIS MEANS. BUT FOR NOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  THE ARROYO BEING OUR BEST BET. PROFESSOR,  THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY TIME. -GRACIAS!  -HASTA LUEGO! ♪♪ Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE BOLIVIAN ANDES, DEEP IN THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY, JEREMY AND JACK CONTINUE  SCOURING THE ARROYO WHERE THEY FOUND OXEN CHAINS  FROM THE 1700s. THE PRESENCE OF THE CHAINS  SUGGESTS THAT THE JESUITS WERE HAULING SOMETHING HEAVY  THROUGH THIS LOCATION. Jeremy: WHY DON'T WE START AT THE TOP, WORK UP AND DOWN, SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND? WHEN IT FLOODS, THE WATER MUST  REALLY RAGE THROUGH HERE. YEAH. ♪♪ AT THE ARROYO,  WE FOUND CHAIN LINKS. I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT  OF A BREAD TRAIL, OR MAYBE A COUPLE MORE PIECES  TO CONFIRM THAT THIS WAS A PATH THEY TOOK. WE'RE GOING TO SET UP  RESISTIVITY AND SEE WHAT'S IN THIS ARROYO,  THIS RAVINE. ALL RIGHT. YOU READY FOR 600 VOLTS? Jack: YEAH. WHAT RESISTIVITY DOES IS,  IT SENDS A CURRENT FROM ONE POINT,  POINT A TO POINT B, UNDERGROUND. WHEN IT ENCOUNTERS ANY TYPE  OF OBSTRUCTION OR EMPTY SPACE, IT HAS TO TAKE A LONGER PATH. AND SO, IN SIMPLISTIC TERMS,  YOU GET MORE RESISTANCE. IF THERE'S ANYTHING UNDERNEATH,  WE'LL FIND IT. [ DEVICE BEEPS ]  FIRST READING IS 50.81. ALL RIGHT.  LET'S MOVE IT. NEXT PIN. READY.

IT APPEARS TO BE 10 FEET,  SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE. SO OUR NEXT STEP, OBVIOUSLY,  IS TO EXCAVATE. QUESTION IS, IS IT NATURAL  OR MAN-MADE? LET'S GET DIGGING. [ GRUNTS ] IT'S FRICKING ROCKS. GREAT. [ GRUNTS ] DUDE, THAT'S ALL SOLID ROCK. IT FEELS LIKE IT. THERE'S, LIKE, A BIG ROCK RIGHT THERE. SEE IT?

BUT ONCE YOU GET THROUGH  ALL THAT, THERE'S A HARD LAYER OF BEDROCK, AND THAT IS AN INGENIOUS ROCK, MEANING IT WAS CREATED BY FIRE THAT HAS COOLED AND FORMED  THIS HARD ROCK. NOW WE MEASURE  THE DENSITY OF ROCK IN GRAMS PER CUBIC CENTIMETERS. AND WHEN WE GET INTO ROCK  THAT'S MORE DENSE THAN 2.5, LIKE IN THIS CASE, IT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT  TO BREAK IT AND MOVE IT. CAN WE GET AROUND IT? THEY'RE PACKED IN THERE  PRETTY DAMN TIGHT. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM OUT BY HAND.  [ SIGHS ] WE NEED TO BRING SOME HEAVY EQUIPMENT UP HERE. WHY DON'T WE SEE IF WE CAN BRING UP THE LITTLE BACKHOE? YEAH, ITS TIRES MIGHT  MAKE IT EASIER TO BRING OUT,  A LITTLE BIT SMALLER. YEP, 'CAUSE THERE'S  NO WAY IN HELL WE'RE GONNA DIG THIS UP BY HAND. Jack: SURE ENOUGH,  WE HIT SOME HARD ROCK, SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  TO HAVE HEAVY EQUIPMENT. WE HIKED A MILE INTO THIS AREA,  AND WE HAD TO CROSS A RIVER, HIKE UP A CLIFF,  GO THROUGH A JUNGLE, AND THEN WORK OUR WAY UP  THIS BOULDER-STREWN PATH. IT'S NOT GONNA BE AN EASY  OR QUICK TRIP. I JUST HOPE IT WORKS. EVERY TIME SOMETHING'S WORKING, I'M JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO BREAK. IT'S A GIVEN. I THINK THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT COULD HAPPEN WOULD BE, LIKE, A COMET COME DOWN  AND STRIKE US DEAD. ♪♪ HEY, GIVE ME SOME ROOM, MAN. THIS AIN'T GOING TO BE PRETTY. Narrator: IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT THE BACKHOE FROM THEIR BASE CAMP NEAR LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY  TO THE ARROYO, THE TEAM WILL HAVE TO NAVIGATE A MILE AND A HALF  OF UNINHABITABLE LANDSCAPE. NEGOTIATING ROCKY,  UNEVEN TERRAIN AND DENSE VEGETATION  AT EVERY TURN. RIGHT THROUGH HERE.  THREAD THAT NEEDLE. Jack:  THE ARROYO IS VERY REMOTE. THIS IS THE MOST BRUTAL GROUND  I'VE EVER BEEN ON. SO ESSENTIALLY, TO BRING  A BACKHOE UP HERE, WE'VE GOT TO CLEAR A PATH. WE'VE GOT TO, ESSENTIALLY,  CUT THROUGH SOME DITCHES AND KIND OF A SWAMPY  JUNGLE AREA. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT EASY. ♪♪ THE BEST PATH MIGHT BE  RIGHT THROUGH HERE, TO THE DIG SITE,  THROUGH THERE. ♪♪ YOU'RE MAKING A 2-LANE HIGHWAY  OUT OF THIS THING. YEAH, YOU BETTER  STAY OUT OF THE WAY. STUFF'S GONNA GO FLYING. ♪♪ NOW YOU'RE JUST SHOWING OFF. ♪♪ Jeremy: HOW MUCH FARTHER  WE GOTTA GO? THIS IS OUR TARGET SPOT,  RIGHT HERE. ♪♪ Narrator: HAVING SUCCEEDED IN TRANSPORTING THE BACKHOE  TO THE ARROYO, JEREMY AND JACK WILL NOW  HAVE TO PENETRATE 10 FEET OF DENSELY PACKED ROCK TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE VOID  DETECTED AT THE SITE.

Narrator: JEREMY AND JACK  SUCCEED IN BRINGING THE BACKHOE TO THE ARROYO TO BREAK THROUGH  THE UNDERGROUND VOID. BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DIG, THE BUCKET OF THE BACKHOE  SUSTAINS MAJOR DAMAGE. [ CLANK ]  -WHOA! WHOA, WHOA! SOMETHING JUST POPPED!  SOMETHING JUST BROKE! [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] THAT LOOKS BAD. THAT IS CLEAN CRACKED.  I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE. THE HAIRLINE THROUGH THERE. THAT JUST ABOUT SHEARED OFF  THIS WHOLE PLATE. I MEAN,  WE ALMOST LOST THE BUCKET. THIS IS AN OLD PIECE  OF EQUIPMENT. IT'S ALREADY BEEN REPAIRED.  I MEAN, IT'S BEEN WELL-USED. SO ONCE WE GOT TO DIGGING, WE NOTICED THAT ACTUALLY  ONE OF THE WELDS IS BROKEN, WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE  TO HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE WE GOT IT UP HERE, BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANOTHER  PROBLEM THAT EATS UP OUR TIME. WE NEED TO DIG INTO THAT  SOMEHOW. IF IT'S 3 METERS DOWN, I BET IT'S JUST SOLID. SOLID ROCK. WHY DON'T I GET  MY MATERIALS OUT AND WE PUT AN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE  DOWN INTO THE HOLE? KNOCK OUT ABOUT 5 FEET  OF DIRT AND ROCK SO IT DOESN'T  BUST THROUGH THE TUNNEL, BUT WE'RE REALLY CLOSE. HMM. I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I MEAN, IF WE CAVE  THE WHOLE THING IN, IT'S JUST GOING TO CREATE MORE PROBLEMS THAN SOLVE THEM. I CAN CLEAR OUT A LOT OF THAT  WITHOUT BREAKING THROUGH. NO, FIRST WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REPAIR THE BACKHOE, 'CAUSE EVEN IF YOUR EXPLOSION  WORKS PERFECTLY, IT'LL ONLY GET HALF  THE JOB DONE. I MEAN, TO GET TO THE TUNNEL,  10 FEET DOWN, WE NEED TO FIX THAT BUCKET. HOW WE GONNA FIX THAT  OUT HERE? METAL'S THAT THICK. IT'S GOTTA BE RE-WELDED. I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO BUT WELD IT. I MEAN, IF YOU KEEP OPERATING  LIKE THIS, THE BUCKET IS JUST  GONNA DROP OFF. [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] I MEAN, JAVI AND SHAWN MIGHT STILL BE IN LA PAZ. WE COULD HAVE THEM  BRING US A WELDER. I MEAN, IT'S THE ONLY THING  WE CAN DO. ♪♪ MAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO GO OVER THESE ROADS TO GET USED TO THEM, BUT I'M NOT THERE YET.

[ SPEAKING SPANISH ] ♪♪ [ BLEEP ] DON'T MAKE ME CLIMB THIS TREE. ALL RIGHT. I GOT THEM. Jack: OH, GOOD.  [ CHUCKLES ] HOPEFULLY,  THEY HAVEN'T LEFT YET. ♪♪ [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] HEY, MAN.  CAN YOU HEAR ME? Jeremy: Yeah, I can hear you.  How you doin'? GOOD, MAN. GOOD. We had a good meeting. I WOULDN'T SAY EVERYTHING IS CONCLUSIVE AND DEFINITIVE YET, BUT, UM... It's likely, could be the arroyo. That's great. Hey, uh, HEY, WE FOUND A VOID UNDERNEATH THE ARROYO. THAT'S AWESOME, MAN. Just one thing. Um... WE CAN'T DIG IT. WE'VE GOT A BROKEN WELD ON THE END OF THE BUCKET And that thing might snap right off if we dig anymore. [ BLEEP ]  You still in La Paz? I NEED A WELDING MACHINE. PREFERABLY, A STICK WELDER, BUT I'LL TAKE ANYTHING. WELL, WE'RE FAR OUT OF LA PAZ. You know, we can head  to the nearest village, BUT I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT WE'RE  GOING TO FIND THERE, THOUGH. IT'S JEREMY. WE GOTTA TURN AROUND. LET'S HEAD TO  THE CLOSEST MARKET, SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND  SOME ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES. [ ENGINE STARTS ]  -Thanks.  -ALL RIGHT, MAN. Jack: WE'VE GOT A DAY TO WAIT  FOR YOUR WELDING SUPPLIES. I'M NOT REAL CRAZY ABOUT GETTING  OUT THE PICK AND SHOVEL AGAIN. THERE'S NO WAY. I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN  BY HAND. I CAN BLOW A LOT OF  THAT DEBRIS OUT OF THERE, PROBABLY WITHOUT BREAKING  THROUGH TO THAT TUNNEL. DUDE, EXPLOSIVES IS NOT  PLASTIC SURGERY. -IT IS WHEN I DO IT.  -HMM. PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT I CAN DO  A SURGICAL SHOT IN THERE AND... HOW CONFIDENT? -I WOULD SAY 8 1/2 OUT OF 10.  -ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT YOU MOVE THIS THING  BACK OUT OF THE WAY? I'LL GO MAKE A SPECIAL CHARGE.  -ALL RIGHT. DO NOT CAVE IN  MY TUNNEL, JACK. COPY. Jack: USING EXPLOSIVES,  THE THING IS, THERE'S ALWAYS THIS SENSE  OF DANGER AND MYSTERY AND, YOU KNOW, REALLY,  IT'S JUST A TOOL IN THE TOOL BOX  LIKE ANYTHING ELSE. ONCE YOU KIND OF KNOW HOW TO  DIRECT THAT EXPLOSIVE ENERGY, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN  BREAK UP ROCK AND SO FORTH WITHOUT REALLY CAUSING  A BIG MESS, IF YOU DO IT RIGHT. FROM THE RESISTIVITY DATA, WE COULD SEE THAT  THE OPENING UNDERGROUND WAS ABOUT 10 FEET DEEP. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS BASICALLY  BLOW, YOU KNOW, 3 OR 4 FEET AT LEAST, OF LOOSE DIRT  AND TOPSOIL OUT OF THE WAY. THAT'LL MAKE IT SO MUCH EASIER  FOR THE BACKHOE WHEN IT'S UP AND RUNNING AGAIN. YOU'LL HAVE HALF THE DEPTH  TO EXCAVATE AND THAT HARD LAYER  OF BEDROCK BELOW THAT WILL BE FRACTURED UP NICE  FROM THE DETONATION. [ EXPLOSION ] DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SMALL CHARGE TO ME. YEAH, IT ACTUALLY IS, CONSIDERING THE SIZE  OF THE HOLE WE GOT THERE. THAT'S 8 POUNDS OF  AMMONIUM NITRATE AND FUEL OIL, ANFO. THIS IS 12 LITTLE STICKS  OF DYNAMITE. LESS THAN HALF-POUNDERS. PUT SOME TAPE AROUND THERE,  PLEASE. THE AMMONIUM NITRATE IS WHAT  THEY CALL A BLASTING AGENT. IT NEEDS ANOTHER HIGH EXPLOSIVE  TO BOOST IT, OR TO INITIATE IT. SO OUR DYNAMITE IS GOING  TO SET IT OFF. Jack: I'VE GOT A CHARGE HERE  THAT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SOCCER BALL. IT'S A ROUND CHARGE. BY HAVING IT THIS SHAPE,  WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO IS, INSTEAD OF PUTTING MORE PRESSURE  STRAIGHT DOWN, THE ENERGY GOES IN  ALL DIRECTIONS IN 360 DEGREES, WHICH SHOULD BE A REALLY  GOOD WAY TO BREAK UP THE BEDROCK DOWN BELOW  WITHOUT CAVING IN THE TUNNEL. OKAY. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS,  WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT IT FROM A SAFE SPOT  UP THROUGH THAT DRIED RIVERBED. HOW ABOUT I RUN THE WIRE  FROM HERE TO THERE? THAT'D BE GREAT. ♪♪ WIRES LOOK GOOD.  CAPS LOOK GOOD. WE HAVE  AN ACTIVE BLAST ZONE. LET'S BUG OUT. ♪♪ SO HERE'S THE DEAL.  THIS IS PERFECT. WE CAN SEE IT  RIGHT THROUGH HERE. WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT IT.

LOOKS LIKE WE SHOOK THE TREES DOWN A BIT. THAT WAS A HUGE EXPLOSION. NO, NO, IT'S ALL --  WE'RE GOOD. THAT BLAST LOOSENED UP ALL THAT DIRT AND ROCK. WE CAN EASILY DIG THAT  RIGHT DOWN TO THE HARD ROCK THAT'S GOING TO BE  OVER THE TOP OF THE TUNNEL. IT'LL SCOOP RIGHT OUT ONCE  THE EQUIPMENT IS WORKING AGAIN. WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE BOYS TO GET BACK WITH MY WELDER. ♪♪ Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE BOLIVIAN ANDES, 5 HOURS AWAY FROM  THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY, SHAWN AND JAVIER HEAD TO  A MARKET IN THE TOWN OF EL ALTO IN SEARCH OF A WELDING MACHINE THAT'S NEEDED TO REPAIR  THE TEAM'S BACKHOE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TO FIND THE STUFF JEREMY NEEDS. WE'VE HAD TO DOUBLE BACK. WE'VE COME BACK HERE  TO GET A WELDING MACHINE. WE'RE GOING TO WASTE A LOT  OF TIME AND MONEY, BUT THAT'S WHAT TREASURE HUNTING  IS ALL ABOUT. WE ARE SO FAR FROM CIVILIZATION THAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO BREAK, OR IF WE NEEDED  A DIFFERENT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, WE'RE GOING TO NEED  TO HAVE TO IMPROVISE AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, OR WE HAVE TO GO WAY OUT OF  THE WAY TO FIND WHAT WE NEED. Javier: ONE SECTION IS, LIKE, USED CLOTHES. OTHER SECTION IS SHOES. YOU HAVE TOYS, CAR PARTS. SO ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE  TO FIND A SECTION THAT HAS, LIKE,  WELDING STUFF? AH, I THINK I SAW  SOMETHING HERE. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] ANY WELDING STUFF? NO, HE SAYS  THEY'RE FURTHER DOWN. ALL RIGHT. Man:  NO, SEÑOR, NO PARA SOLDAR. -GRACIAS.  -BUENOS TARDES... NO HAY. HEY, HEY, HEY. AH. NO WELDER, BUT SHE HAS  WELDING RODS. WELDING RODS. IS THAT THE BEST SHE'S GOT? -SON ESTOS?  -Woman: Sí. Narrator:  A WELDING ROD IS A STICK MADE OF THICK WIRE,  THROUGH WHICH A CURRENT IS TRANSMITTED THAT GENERATES  THE HEAT NEEDED TO FUSE TWO PIECES OF METAL. BUT THE MAIN COMPONENT  OF THE WELDING MACHINE THAT PRODUCES THE CURRENT  IS UNAVAILABLE AT THIS MARKET. I GUESS SOMETHING IS BETTER  THAN NOTHING, YEAH? MAYBE JEREMY CAN RIG SOMETHING UP WITH THIS.

YOU KNOW, I'M WELL AWARE  THAT EVERY PRIOR EXPEDITION WAS SHUT DOWN  BECAUSE OF THE RAINY SEASON. THEY ALL GOT WASHED OUT. I DON'T WANT TO END UP LIKE  ALL THOSE OTHER EXPEDITIONS.

JUST ONE THING WE GOTTA DO,  AND THAT'S GET THAT BACKHOE BACK INTO ACTION.  -OH. 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT  DIGGING THIS UP BY HAND. YOU SEE IT?  JUST ABOUT SHEARED OFF. IF WE WOULD'VE  SHEARED IT OFF, I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T  JUST WELD IT BACK UP. YOU'D HAVE TO REPLACE  EVERYTHING. BUT I CAN WELD  THAT BACK TOGETHER. SORRY, MAN. NOT A SINGLE WELDING MACHINE  IN THE VILLAGE. ALL THEY HAD WAS WELDING RODS. COULD YOU RIG  SOMETHING UP WITH THAT? Jeremy: SERIOUSLY? [ GROANS ]  WELL... ♪♪ I SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIG  SOMETHING UP. PULL THE BATTERIES  OUT OF THE MACHINE. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? Jeremy: I'VE WELDED  WITH BATTERIES BEFORE. GIVE ME YOUR SUNGLASSES.  I'LL FIX IT. SO TO WELD THE BUCKET, I NEED TO HAVE  AN ELECTRICAL SOURCE. LOW VOLTAGE, HIGH AMPERAGE. THE ONLY THING I HAVE ARE  THE STARTING BATTERIES FROM THE BACKHOE. I'VE WELDED WITH BATTERIES  BEFORE. THERE'S A LOT OF POWER THERE,  AND SO, HOPEFULLY, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO GET DONE  WHAT I NEED TO GET DONE. I'M GOING TO HOOK THE BATTERIES  UP WITH THE JUMPER CABLES FROM THE VEHICLE THAT SHAWN  AND JAVIER DROVE BACK IN. WE'RE GOING TO HOOK UP THE BACKHOE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE AND MY WELDING ROD  TO THE POSITIVE SIDE. BETWEEN THE TWO,  IT'LL CREATE AN ARC POWER AND A WELD  FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S GOING TO DEPLETE  THE BATTERIES VERY QUICKLY, SO I'VE GOT TO MOVE FAST. I'M GOING TO GET ONE CHANCE  AT THIS AND, HOPEFULLY, WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH JUICE TO START  THE BACKHOE UP WHEN I'M DONE.

IT ISN'T ABLE TO IDENTIFY  WHETHER THE METAL IS FERROUS OR NONFERROUS,  LIKE GOLD, SILVER OR BRONZE, WHICH IS WHY JAVI IS SWEEPING  THE AREA BEHIND ME WITH, YOU KNOW, THE TOP-OF-THE-LINE  METAL DETECTOR THAT WE HAVE. SO HAVING BOTH OF THOSE  TECHNOLOGIES TOGETHER? PERFECT. YOU KNOW, WITH THE CHAINS  JUST SOUTH OF US, THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE ALONG THIS TRAIL. DID YOU GO ALL THE WAY UP? I DID, BUT GO AHEAD. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, AS I SAID, YOU MIGHT GET  SOMETHING SMALLER. IT COULD COME UP A LOT EASIER  ON YOUR DETECTOR THAN ON MY DETECTOR. THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE CHAINS OR SOMETHING AROUND HERE. -WE ALREADY SHOWED THAT...  [ DETECTOR CHIRPS ] -DID YOU HEAR THAT?  -GOT SOMETHING? [ DETECTOR CHIRPING ] ♪♪ GOT SOMETHING HERE. FERROUS OR NONFERROUS? I DON'T KNOW, JAVI. IT'S A BIG  HIT, BUT LOOK AT THAT. IT'S PINGING ON 10. [ DETECTOR CHIRPS ] SO YOU THINK  IT MIGHT BE GOLD? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT, MY FRIEND. [ DETECTOR CHIRPING ] OOH, THERE YOU GO. IT'S SUPER CONDUCTIVE. IT'S NONFERROUS. Shawn: IT'S NOT IRON.  THIS IS SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT. -WE MIGHT HAVE GOLD.  [ DETECTOR CHIRPS ] ALL RIGHT. WELL, HOLD THAT SPOT. I'M GONNA GO GRAB A SHOVEL.  -OKAY, OKAY. ♪♪ Jeremy: IT SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING DIED DOWN HERE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S BEEN  IN HERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. I'M NOT SURE HOW GOOD  THE AIR IS DOWN HERE. [ EXHALES SHARPLY, GASPS ] [ COUGHS, SNIFFLES ] OH, MY EYES ARE WATERING. -OH.  -GOD DANG. THAT'S SICKENING. IT'S GETTING WORSE. LET ME GO AHEAD  WITH THE SNIFFER. JUST STAY HERE.  -OKAY. [ EXHALES SHARPLY, GASPS ] ♪♪ ♪♪ -I MEAN, THAT WAS A BIG --  -Javier: HEY, LOOK AT THIS. WHAT IS THIS? I DON'T KNOW. IS IT METAL? HANG ON. THIS IS SOMETHING. [ DEVICE BEEPS ] LOOK. IT'S NOT RINGING  ON THE PINPOINTER. BE CAREFUL. -LOOK AT THIS.  -HUH. WOW. IT'S LIKE, UH,  POTTERY, YOU KNOW? THIS HAS TO BE INCA. YOU KNOW, THEY HAD  THESE LITTLE JARS. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, JAVI. A DRINKING CUP, MAYBE? OR SOMETHING TO HOLD  GRAINS IN OR SPICE? WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT  WHAT WAS RINGING ON THE METAL DETECTOR.

NO, I DON'T THINK SO, JAVI. IF IT WAS A CANNON, IT WOULDN'T HAVE A HANDLE LIKE THIS. THE HANDLES ON A CANNON  WOULD BE ON THIS PART. AND ON THIS PART WOULD BE  JUST A BALL. OH, LOOK AT THIS! IS THAT A CROSS? THIS LOOKS FREAKING OLD. IT'S NONFERROUS AND IT'S RIGHT ON THE TRAIL. THIS IS A HUGE FIND. ♪♪ Jeremy: SO WE'LL START 1 METER AWAY FROM THAT TREE. THAT'LL BE OUR CENTER.  -Jack: OKAY. AND SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE. ONE OF THE TOOLS  THAT WE HAVE IS RESISTIVITY, WHICH IS THE MOST THOROUGH  AND, LITERALLY, THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL  IN A TREASURE HUNTER'S TOOLKIT. CLEAR?  -CLEAR. Jeremy: RESISTIVITY  IS THE PROCESS OF INSERTING ELECTRO PINS INTO THE GROUND, AND THEN SHOOTING 500 VOLTS  OF ELECTRICITY DOWN BELOW. ALL RIGHT. FIRING UP. IF THERE'S A VOID  OR VACUUM UNDERGROUND, THE CURRENT WILL FACE RESISTANCE AND SENDS A HIGHER THAN NORMAL  RESISTANCE READING ABOVE. YEAH, WE'VE GOT A VOID. THE ADVANTAGE TO RESISTIVITY  IS WE CAN SCAN HUGE PLOTS IN, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE HOURS. PROBLEM IS, IT'S A SOMEWHAT SLOW  AND COMPLEX OPERATION, AND BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING  WITH ELECTRICITY, YOU KNOW, IT CAN ALSO  BE DANGEROUS, SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO  STAY ALERT AT ALL TIMES. [ ELECTRICITY ZAPS ]  -Jack: AAH! -YOU ALL RIGHT?  -GREAT. YOU GOTTA WATCH WHAT I'M DOING UP ON THIS END. ALL RIGHT, MOVE IT OVER 1 METER. ♪♪ -Javier: THIS IS BIG.  -Shawn: WHOA.

COME ON. ♪♪ Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE ARROYO, JEREMY AND JACK CONTINUE  THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE FOUL-SMELLING TUNNEL. [ COUGHS ] YOU THINK THIS IS NATURAL? I MEAN, IF WE'RE UNDER  THE ARROYO, WHICH IS JUST A DRIED RIVERBED,  THIS COULD BE, LIKE, A LAVA TUBE  OR SOMETHING, WHERE WATER FLOWS  THROUGH HERE WHEN IT FLOODS. -CUT BY WATER?  -YEAH.
