ARMED WITH A TOP HAMMER  DRILL EXCAVATOR, AS WELL AS A BACKHOE, THE TEAM HOPES TO FINALLY  PENETRATE THE BEDROCK THAT'S BLOCKING THE REENTRY  INTO THE JESUIT TUNNEL. Shawn:  THIS EQUIPMENT'S  SERIOUSLY POWERFUL AND WE KNOW THAT NONE  OF THE PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS BROUGHT ANY TOOL BIGGER  THAN A STEAM DRILL DOWN HERE, SO WE'RE TRULY  IN UNCHARTERED TERRITORY HERE.

AND THE SECOND CEREMONY  WILL BE BELOW GROUND, YOU KNOW, AT THE ENTRANCE  OF THE TUNNEL. ANYTIME ANY WORK IS DONE  UNDERGROUND IN BOLIVIA, THEY SEEK PERMISSION FROM  EL TíO, LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD, WHICH MAY ALSO BE CONSIDERED  AS THE DEVIL. DOING THIS CEREMONY ON HIS TURF IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP US SAFE  AND, HOPEFULLY, PROSPEROUS. ONCE YOU ENTER THE MINE, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE  IN EL TíO'S TURF, SO YOU GOTTA  FEED HIM RIGHT. HE'LL GIVE YOU...

BY THEN, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERCEPT  THAT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL. LET'S BRING THE HAMMER IN RIGHT  HERE AND TAKE THE ROCK OUT.

IT'S SUCH A HEAVY HAMMER  THAT IT JUST POUNDS ROCK AND BREAKS IT INTO PIECES  PRETTY EASILY.

[ SUSPENSEFUL CHORD STRIKES ] BACKHOE!  BRING IT IN. Narrator:  SHAWN'S TEAM IS  THE FIRST ONE, EVER, TO BRING HEAVY EQUIPMENT  DOWN TO THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY.

THE WHOLE GROUND WAS SHAKING  AND, SURE ENOUGH, IT DISLODGED A BUNCH OF BOULDERS  AND IT CAME TUMBLIN' DOWN. THIS BOULDER RIGHT HERE,  YOU SEE THAT? THERE'S A BUNCH OF 'EM UP THERE, JUST HANGING. I THINK, IF WE CONTINUE,  THAT WHOLE THING'S COMING DOWN. YEAH, THIS IS, UH,  THIS IS A SERIOUS BLOW. WE CAN'T REPOSITION THE HOLE 'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE  THE TUNNEL IS. I MEAN, IT'S INCREDIBLY  FRUSTRATING THAT WE HAVE TO STOP, BUT,  RUNNING THE EQUIPMENT HERE CERTAINLY IS NOT WORTH CAUSING  SERIOUS INJURY TO SOMEBODY. BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW,  THE DENSITY OF THE BEDROCK HERE IS REALLY CONSIDERABLE  AND IT'S GRANITE ROCK AND IT'S ABOUT 2.7 GRAMS  PER CUBIC CENTIMETER, SO WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT USING  THIS MASSIVE HAMMER DRILL. ♪♪ WE GOTTA COME UP  WITH A BETTER PLAN. SINCE WE CAN'T CHANGE THE LOCATION OF THE DIG, I MEAN, REALISTICALLY,  WE COULD TRY TO DO SOME SCALING. SCALING IS A TERM USED  FOR KNOCKING DOWN LOOSE ROCK BEFORE IT FALLS ON ITS OWN  AND ROAD CREWS, AND SO FORTH, USE THESE TECHNIQUES  ALONG ROADWAYS WHERE THEY'RE AGAINST A CLIFF  WITH A LOT OF LOOSE ROCKS AND, IN OUR CASE, THEY'RE FALLING RIGHT INTO OUR JOB SITE. I'M GONNA HAVE TO ACTUALLY CLIMB UP THAT MOUNTAIN AND SET EXPLOSIVE CHARGES  ALONG THE RIDGE AND SHOOT THE LOOSE  ROCKS DOWN BEFORE THEY FALL ON US. MY CONCERN IS YOU'RE  GONNA KNOCK ALL THOSE BOULDERS RIGHT DOWN  WHERE WE'RE DIGGIN'. WE'RE GONNA HAVE  TO MOVE 'EM AGAIN. WELL, I CAN MAKE DIRECTIONAL EXPLOSIVES THAT PUNCH THE BOULDERS AWAY FROM OUR DIG SITE,  HOPEFULLY. I MEAN, IT'S NOT EASY  TO DO, THOUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE  MUCH OF A CHOICE. ALL RIGHT.  BE REALLY CAREFUL. WE'RE GONNA MOVE  EVERYTHING OUTTA HERE AND WE'RE GETTING WAY  THE HELL BACK. LET'S GET TO IT BEFORE  THAT FRICKIN' THING STARTS TO COME DOWN  ON ITS OWN.

SO THE MISSION IS: WE SET  A SERIES OF EXPLOSIVE CHARGES ALONG THIS RIDGELINE  THAT HAS ALL THIS LOOSE ROCK AND TRY TO MAKE THEM  DIRECTIONAL, SO IT SENDS THE BOULDERS  OFF THE CLIFF. WHAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE CREATED  SPECIAL, SHAPED CHARGES THAT ESSENTIALLY PUNCH  THE BOULDERS HARD, BREAK 'EM APART, AND MOVE THEM  OUT OF THE WAY, INTO PIECES, AWAY FROM OUR DIG SITE. IT'S A TRICKY JOB. [ WIND WHIPPING ] THIS IS DET CORD,  EXPLODING FUSE. IT'S GOOD FOR CONNECTING  CHARGES TOGETHER. WE HOOK THE BLASTING CAP  UP, FIRST. IN CASE THERE'S ANY STATIC  ELECTRICITY IN THE LINE, IT DOESN'T BLOW THE CHARGE  UP IN OUR LAP. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT.  THIS IS GOOD. LET'S KEEP MOVIN' DOWN THE LINE. I'M GONNA CAREFULLY BACK  OUTTA HERE WITHOUT TRIPPING OVER THE WIRE. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A HUGE ELEMENT  OF DANGER TO THIS. THERE'S ALSO A HUGE ELEMENT  OF RESPONSIBILITY, ON MY PART. WE'RE HITTIN' THESE  BOULDERS PRETTY HARD, SO, WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY,  MY MAIN CONCERN IS I'M NOT SHOWERING  ANYBODY DOWN BELOW WHEN THAT ROCK'S FLYING  THROUGH THE AIR. ♪♪ OKAY.  WE HAVE A LIVE BLAST ZONE. LET'S BUG OUT. ♪♪ WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME NOISE. ♪♪ THERE'S A BIG RAIN CLOUD  MOVIN' IN. [ THUNDER RUMBLING,  BIRDS CHIRPING ] JACK, HOW YOU DOING  UP THERE, BUDDY?

IN THE MORNING,  WE'LL SEE. ♪♪ [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] Narrator:  NEXT MORNING, THE TEAM  RETURNS TO THE DIG SITE TO TEST IF JACK'S EXPLOSIONS  HAVE ELIMINATED THE DANGER OF LOOSE ROCK  FROM THE NEARBY HILLSIDE. JACK, YOU FEELING PRETTY  GOOD ABOUT THE RIDGE AND ALL THE ROCKS UP THERE?  -YEAH. WE'RE GOOD. HAVING A LOOK AT THE CLIFF, I WAS HAPPY TO SEE  THOSE BOULDERS WERE HIT PRETTY HARD  AND KNOCKED OVER THE EDGE, SO IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE  IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL MISSION. JACK'S VERY CONFIDENT  WE'LL BE SAFE TO DIG AND, IN LOOKING UP, IT SEEMS  GOOD, FROM WHAT I CAN SEE, BUT, I REALLY HOPE WE DON'T  START ANOTHER LANDSLIDE. LET'S GET THIS HOLE DUG. TURN 'ER OVER, EDGAR. [ ENGINE STUTTERS, STARTS ] ♪♪ SLOW AND STEADY. [ CLACKING ] ♪♪ THAT SOUNDS  PRETTY SOLID. OH, THAT'S SOLID,  ALL RIGHT. LOOK AT THAT MONSTER. [laughing] IT KICKED IT RIGHT OUT. ♪♪ ALTHOUGH WE HAVE  HEAVY EQUIPMENT NOW, WE GO IN THERE,  JUST ALL GUNS BLAZIN', AND WE COULD CAVE  THE WHOLE THING IN. YOU HAVE TO WORK IN A VERY  SLOW AND METHODICAL WAY. WE STARTED THE PROCESS  BY JACKHAMMERING THROUGH THE CAPROCK  AND THEN USING THE BACKHOE TO SCOOP ROCK  AND DIRT OUT OF THE GROUND. ♪♪ IT'S ALMOST LIKE OPENING  A CHRISTMAS PRESENT WITH A BIG, BIG BACKHOE.  [laughs] WHOA, WHOA, HOLD ON.  STOP, STOP! LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. THERE'S A HOLE. FRANZ, APáGALO. WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO,  SHAWN? WHAT ARE YOU THINKIN'? CAN'T RISK ANOTHER CAVE-IN, SO I'M GONNA OPEN UP THIS  CAREFULLY BY HAND. JAVI, HELP ME WITH THIS. ONCE WE OPENED UP A HOLE, I DIDN'T WANNA BRING  THE BUCKET IN THERE ANY FURTHER 'CAUSE THAT COULD'VE CAVED  THE WHOLE THING IN AND WE WOULD'VE  HAD A MUCH WORSE SITUATION THAN WE HAD STARTED WITH. CAN WE SPAN THIS ACROSS,  YOU THINK? SO, AT THIS POINT,  I WANNA OPEN THIS UP BY HAND. ♪♪ JEREMY, LET'S TIE A LINE. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT.  -ALL RIGHT.

THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY HELPED  KEEP IT AS GOOD AS IT IS. YEAH. THIS ISN'T JUST EMBROIDERY  OR A PIECE OF CLOTH. THIS IS THE FIRST ACTUAL JESUIT  GOLD WE'VE LAID OUR HANDS ON. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ] IT'S A GOLD CLOTH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THEY CALL IT  "REAL CLOTH OF GOLD" BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY MADE  FROM GOLD BULLION. WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THEY'D ACTUALLY TAKE A SMALL, GOLD BAR, POUND IT OUT,  AND MAKE A GOLD THREAD AND THEN, THEY'D WEAVE  THIS PURE, GOLD THREAD THROUGH THE REST OF THE CLOTH. CLOTH OF GOLD WAS USED  TO CREATE THESE INCREDIBLY ORNATE  AND VERY EXPENSIVE VESTMENTS THAT WERE WORN EITHER  BY VERY AFFLUENT PEOPLE OR, MORE LIKELY,  VERY HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. I'VE ONLY SEEN THEM  IN ILLUSTRATIONS. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. YOU WOULD NEVER SEE ANYTHING  LIKE THIS TODAY. THEY HAVEN'T DONE THIS  IN HUNDREDS OF YEARS. IT'S WAY TOO  COST-PROHIBITIVE.

EXACTLY. I GUESS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS I'VE GOT IS: WHY THE HELL IS THERE JUST  ONE LITTLE PIECE OF IT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I WANNA  FIND THE REST OF IT. LET'S BAG THIS UP,  AND THEN WE'RE GONNA SCOUR THE WHOLE AREA,  UNTIL WE FIND MORE. UP UNTIL NOW, WE'RE ALL  HOPING THAT WE'RE RIGHT, THAT THE TREASURE IS HERE,  IN SACAMBAYA, BUT, UNTIL YOU CAN ACTUALLY  PLACE YOUR HANDS ON AN ARTIFACT  THAT IS GENUINE JESUIT, YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW. I MEAN, FINDING THIS GOLD CLOTH  GIVES ME A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE  THAT THE TREASURE EXISTS AND, HOPEFULLY,  IT'S RIGHT HERE IN THIS TUNNEL, BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE  WE COVER EVERYTHING, EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY.

LET'S SEE IF IT IS  WHAT WE THINK IT IS. LET'S TEST IT. IN TREASURE HUNTING,  AFTER YOU UNEARTH AN ARTIFACT, THE FIRST QUESTIONS  THAT ALWAYS POP UP ARE: "WHAT EXACTLY IS IT MADE OF?"  AND "HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH?" BACK IN THE OLD DAYS,  WE'D HAVE TO BRING ALONG VARIOUS ACIDS, CHEMICALS, TO HELP IDENTIFY THE METALLIC  COMPOSITION OF THE RELIC. IT WAS A SOMEWHAT IMPRECISE  AND DANGEROUS PROCESS, BUT, NOW, WE HAVE  SOPHISTICATED ALLOY TESTERS. BASICALLY, THE DEVICE SERVES AS OUR PERSONAL METAL APPRAISER, OUR PORTABLE PAWN SHOP,  YOU KNOW. IT'LL INSTANTANEOUSLY ZERO IN ON THE EXACT METAL OR METALS  THAT MAKE UP THE OBJECT AND, IN THE CASE OF GOLD,  IT'LL EVEN REVEAL ITS PURITY, DOWN TO THE EXACT KARAT,  IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. -WHOA.  -I MEAN, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THAT'S GOLD.  -THAT'S IT. THAT'S WHY, DURING  A GRUELING TREASURE HUNT, THE ALLOY TESTER COMES IN REAL HANDY IN KEEPING THE SPIRITS UP. Shawn:  THIS IS GONNA LEAD US TO MORE. I AM PUMPED.  [ SUSPENSEFUL FLOURISH PLAYS ] -YOU SEE IT?  -IT'S A SCORPION. DON'T MOVE. [BLEEP] MAN. THAT'S  THE BOLIVIAN BROWN. DO NOT MOVE. YOU GOTTA RELAX.  -I'M TRYING. -REALLY CAREFUL.  -[BLEEP] OH!

I GOT 'IM. I GOT 'IM. I GOT 'IM. -OHH!  -I GOT 'IM. [ CREATURES CHIRPING ] AHH! ♪♪ THERE HE IS. THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL. Shawn:  DID YOU LEAVE THIS TENT  OPEN, AT SOME POINT? I THINK I JUST  FELL ASLEEP. I'M SO TIRED,  I JUST FELL ASLEEP. THAT'S COMPLACENCY,  MY FRIEND. YOU GOTTA WATCH IT.  YOU GOTTA KEEP THIS TENT ZIPPED UP AT ALL TIMES. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. NEVER A DULL MOMENT. Jeremy:  ZIP UP YOUR TENT, BOYS. [ SUSPENSEFUL CHORD STRIKES ] ♪♪ [ INSECTS RATTLING ] IT'S A LITTLE SKETCHY,  GOING DOWN, SO BE CAREFUL.

JEREMY AND JACK, I WOULD LIKE  FOR YOU GUYS TO WORK WITH THE METAL DETECTORS. JEREMY, WHERE YOU FOUND  THE SKELETON. -RIGHT.  -YEP. JAVIER, YOU WILL METAL-DETECT  AROUND WHERE WE FOUND THE CLOTH AND THE MINER'S CART.  -RIGHT. I THINK SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT  HAPPENED THERE AND I REALLY WANNA  THOROUGHLY WORK THAT. AND I'M GONNA GO WORK  THE CAVERN THAT WAS CLOSE TO THAT AREA. -PERFECT.  -THIS IS A DANGEROUS PLACE. YOU CAN GET TURNED AROUND  IN HERE SO EASY. WE REALLY GOT TO USE  A LOT OF CAUTION. OKAY?  -Javier: OKAY. Jack: YEAH.  -LET'S DO IT. Narrator:  SHAWN AND JAVIER WILL SEARCH  THE TWO RECESSES LOCATED NEAR  THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE; WHILE JEREMY AND JACK  WILL HEAD DEEPER IN, COMBING THROUGH THE MAIN SHAFT  OF THE PASSAGEWAY. JACK, MOVE SLOW, MAN. ALL THIS LOOSE STUFF COULD BE COVERIN' UP  ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. I KNOW. YOU COULD BE STEPPIN', AND YOU MIGHT FALL  RIGHT THROUGH A HOLE. WELL,  THAT CHEERS ME UP.

YEAH, THAT'S REALLY HEAVY. WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? IT WAS RIGHT HERE. [ DEBRIS CASCADES ]  WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK  IT'S MADE OUT OF? DO YOU THINK  IT'S SILVER? I MEAN, IF THIS WAS SILVER, IT WOULD'VE OXIDIZED MORE,  TURNED BLACK. ALSO, ITS WEIGHT. THIS ISN'T SILVER. THIS IS LEAD. BOY, I TELL YA,  THAT'S DEFINITELY A CROSS. IT'S JESUIT. I JUST CAN'T QUITE MAKE OUT  WHAT THESE MARKS ARE HERE. THERE'S A DATE  IN THE BACK. THE ROMAN NUMERALS HERE?  136. THIS ISN'T A DATE. THIS IS PROBABLY AN INVENTORY  NUMBER OR A VOLUME NUMBER. YOU KNOW  WHAT I THINK THIS IS? I THINK THIS IS A BALE SEAL. A BALE SEAL  IS A REALLY INTERESTING PRE-COLOMBIAN ARTIFACT  AND IT'S FULL OF INFORMATION. THE FIRST THING, IT'S SORT OF  A TAMPER-RESISTANT ON A PACKAGE  THAT'S BEING SHIPPED, ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE  OF THE CONTAINER, SO, IF THE RECEIVER WAS  TO GET THIS PACKAGE AND THE BALE SEAL WAS BROKEN, THEY'D KNOW THAT SOMEBODY'S  BEEN INTO THE PACKAGE. AND, SECONDLY,  A BALE SEAL WILL HAVE A LOT OF SYMBOLISM AND MARKINGS. THOSE MARKINGS GIVE YOU  GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE IT'S COMING FROM AND WHAT NUMBER THIS MIGHT BE  IN A WHOLE ARRAY OF PACKAGES. ♪♪ LOOKING AT THE SYMBOLS  ON THIS BALE SEAL, THE CROSS, THE ROMAN NUMERALS, WHATEVER WAS ATTACHED TO THIS  BALE SEAL WAS FROM THE JESUITS, AND IT WAS ONE OF MANY PACKAGES. [ SUSPENSEFUL CHORD STRIKES ] 136.  THESE ARE BIG NUMBERS. THIS REPRESENTS  A MASSIVE SHIPMENT. SO, IT'S POSSIBLE  THAT 136 PACKAGES ROLLED THROUGH HERE, ALONG WITH THIS ONE? YEAH, AND THERE'S NO DOUBT  IN MY MIND THERE'S MORE TO BE FOUND. BUT WHAT DO THESE  MARKINGS MEAN? IT MIGHT BE  A MAJOR CLUE. RIGHT. IF WE CAN DECIPHER  THESE MARKINGS, I THINK WE'LL LEARN  A LOT MORE ABOUT THE HOARD THAT I FIRMLY BELIEVE WAS  BROUGHT UP THROUGH THIS TUNNEL.
