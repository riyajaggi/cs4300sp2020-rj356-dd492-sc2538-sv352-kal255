SHAWN, YOU SEEING -- YOU GUYS SEEING WHAT I'M SEEING? OH,  IS THAT A WATERMARK? THAT'S A PERMANENT WATERMARK. THIS MUD  LOOKS FRESH, TOO. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME  THE MOST. THIS IS RECENT --  MAYBE ONE WEEK AGO. AND IT WENT ALL THE WAY UP  TO THIS MARK RIGHT HERE. I BET YOU  WHEN A REAL STORM COMES, THE WATER GOES ALL THE WAY UP  TO THE CEILING. I MEAN, AS WE GO DEEPER AND YOU GUYS NOTICE THIS LINE GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER  AS WE GO DEEPER... YEAH,  IT'S GETTING HIGHER. THIS IS  A LOT WETTER. THIS IS NOT  A GOOD SIGN.

BUT THEIR TIME'S  FAST RUNNING OUT BECAUSE THE SEASONAL RAINS  HAVE ARRIVED, AND THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY IS QUICKLY FILLING UP  WITH WATER. WE GET A FLASH FLOOD IN HERE,  WE'RE SCREWED. Shawn: YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?  LET'S STEP IT UP. Jeremy: NO,  WE GOT TO DO THIS FAST. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] GUYS,  WATCH YOUR HEAD HERE. MAN, THIS IS TIGHT. Jeremy: WOW.  REALLY LOW.

THAT'S THE CHAMBER. IF THIS IS A VAULT,  WE GOT TO CONSIDER GAS, POISONS. ARSENIC LASTS FOREVER. IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH WIND, IT BASICALLY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR. YOU GOT YOUR SNIFFER? YEAH. ♪♪ IT'S CLEAN ON HERE,  MAN. Jack: SO IT'S SEALED. I MEAN, THEY SEALED IT  FOR A REASON. Shawn:  THIS FALSE WALL -- THERE'S SOMETHING  SIGNIFICANT BEHIND IT THAT SOMEBODY WAS OBVIOUSLY  TRYING TO PROTECT. SO THAT MEANS  GOING BY THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT AND ALL THE OTHER  HISTORICAL RECORDS, IT'S PROBABLY BOOBY TRAPPED, SO I DON'T WANT  TO JUST RUSH INTO THIS AND RIP DOWN THIS WALL. I WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY  THAT'S SAFE FOR ALL OF US. AT THE SAME TIME,  WE GOT TO DO IT NOW. Jack: WHY DON'T WE JUST PULL IT DOWN? JUST GRAB SOME 'PICKS  AND SHOVELS, MAN. PULL IT DOWN. I JUST DON'T THINK WE WANT TO BE  HERE WHEN THIS WALL COMES DOWN. I HAVE TO AGREE. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE  AND OPEN THIS UP IF A FREAKING DEADFALL COMES OR WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND  OF BOOBY TRAP COULD BE BEHIND THERE. WE GOT TO THINK  OF A BETTER PLAN. YOU KNOW MY SOLUTION -- PUT A SMALL CHARGE  UP THERE AND PUNCH THROUGH THE TOP AND SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE  ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THAT WAY, IF THERE  IS ANY GAS OR BOULDERS OR ANYTHING  WAITING FOR US, WE'RE NOT AROUND  WHEN IT COMES DOWN. JACK, IF YOU SET SOME  EXPLOSIVES IN HERE AND YOU CAVE THIS WHOLE THING IN, OUR CHANCES OF GETTING TO WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS ARE DONE. NO, I CAN DO IT. I MEAN, WE'RE WAY,  WAY DEEP IN THIS TUNNEL. SOMETHING GOES WRONG  WITH YOUR EXPLOSION... -I KNOW.  -...WE'RE [BLEEP] YES. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE EXPLOSION, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. THE CEILING, THESE WALLS --  IT'S SOLID ROCK. IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS  FOR 300 YEARS. LISTEN. HEY. [ THUNDER RUMBLES IN DISTANCE ] -IS THAT THUNDER?  -TOP-SIDE. Shawn: [BLEEP] YEAH, WE GOT  TO DO THIS FAST, MAN. JACK, LET'S GO BACK  TO THAT CLEARING, AND LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE JUST USING  THREE STICKS. THEY'RE PRETTY SMALL -- THEY'RE LESS  THAN A HALF A POUND EACH. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE  A MESS OF THINGS. WE'VE RUN INTO A MANMADE WALL. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THICK IT IS, WE DON'T KNOW  WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS, I WANT TO ESSENTIALLY CRACK  THIS EGG OPEN, RIGHT? I DON'T WANT TO DO  A CHARGE THAT'S TOO BIG. IN FACT, ONLY THREE STICKS  OF DYNAMITE -- A STICK AND A HALF  ON THE TOP ON EACH SIDE -- JUST TO KIND OF CRACK  THIS WALL OPEN TO GIVE US SOME IDEA  OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT. THEN WHEN THOSE STONES  COME DOWN, WE'RE NOT THERE IN CASE THERE'S  ANY DANGER ON THE OTHER SIDE. I'M DOING TWO FUSES  FOR REDUNDANCY, FOR SAFETY. IF ONLY ONE GOES OFF, IT SHOULD  STILL SET OFF THE OTHER CHARGE. SO YOU'RE GOING TO LIGHT BOTH THESE FUSES AT THE SAME TIME? YES. SO I'M PUTTING MATCH HEADS  INTO THE SAFETY FUSE. THERE'S GUNPOWDER IN THE CENTER  OF THE SAFETY FUSE. I'M GOING TO LIGHT THESE  WITH A LIGHTER, AND THEN IT'S GOING TO  IGNITE THE SAFETY FUSE. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO DESTROY WHAT'S ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF IT. NO, IT'S ALL GOOD. Shawn:  KNOWING JACK AND HIS SKILL SET, I KNOW  THAT HE CAN PROBABLY DO IT WITH SOME SURGICAL ABILITY. JAVI, I NEED YOU TO HOLD  THOSE CAPS FOR ME POINTING TOWARDS THE BACK WALL  THERE AWAY FROM US. Shawn: ON THE OTHER HAND,  THERE'S ALWAYS RISK WHEN USING EXPLOSIVES, EVEN MORE SO USING EXPLOSIVES  DEEP UNDERGROUND IN A TUNNEL. THE RISKS INCLUDE THAT WE COULD  CAVE THIS THING IN, WE COULD CAVE  OUR EXIT OUT OF HERE IN. ANOTHER ONE IS SIMPLY THE GASES THAT ARE GOING  TO BE PRODUCED BY THE TNT AND WHATEVER HE MAY EXPOSE  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS WALL. YEAH, THERE'S SOME SERIOUS  RISK HERE, BUT IT'S A RISK  WE HAVE TO TAKE. SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO,  GUYS, IS GET  TO THE AIR-VENTILATION SHAFT BECAUSE WE KNOW WE GOT FRESH AIR  COMING THROUGH THERE, RIGHT? -RIGHT.  -I THINK THAT'S THE SAFEST SPOT BECAUSE REGARDLESS  OF WHAT COMES OVER THAT WALL, AT LEAST WE'VE GOT  SOME AIR FLOWING WHERE WE DROPPED DOWN  INITIALLY. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. WE'VE GOT ABOUT, EH,  A COUPLE MINUTES, PROBABLY. -OKAY.  -IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE. -IS IT OKAY IF I DO IT?  -DO IT. -THERE IT GOES.  -THERE IT GOES. -LET'S GET THE HELL OUT.  -LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. FOLLOW US, GUYS. FOLLOW US. FOLLOW US. Jack:  LET'S JUST KEEP MOVING. Jeremy: HOW MUCH TIME  DO WE HAVE, JACK? [ CLEARS THROAT ]  WELL, A MINUTE, PROBABLY. Shawn: GO. GO. GO. WHOA!  WHOA. -AAH.  -YOU ALL RIGHT? -DUDE. UGH!  -DAMN! [ MEN COUGH ] Jack: THAT WAS A LITTLE CLOSER  THAN I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE. Shawn: JAVI, YOU ALL RIGHT? Javier: I'M OKAY, MAN.  EVERYBODY GOOD? UGH. GIVE IT A MINUTE  TO SETTLE OUT. [ MEN COUGH ] CAN'T GET THE TREASURE IF YOU DROP DEAD ON THE WAY THERE. -[ GRUNTS ]  -IT'S CLEARING OUT. CAN'T WE JUST GO NOW?  -YEAH, LET'S GO. Jeremy:  GIVE US THE SNIFFER. HERE, SHAWN. IT'S YOU. YOU'RE ON POINT.  LET'S DO THIS. Jeremy: [ COUGHS ] SHAWN, HOW DOES IT LOOK? LET ME JUST TEST IT  WITH THE SNIFFER FIRST. ♪♪ SHAWN, TALK TO ME, MAN. THE AIR'S OKAY. OH [BLEEP] WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? I THINK THEY BURIED THEIR HORDE  UNDERNEATH A BIG LAKE. ♪♪ ♪♪ Shawn: WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.  WE'RE OUT OF TUNNEL, GUYS. Narrator:  THE EXPEDITION'S PROGRESS  DEEPER INTO THE TUNNEL IS BLOCKED BY A FALSE WALL. Shawn: THIS IS HOLLOW.  YEAH. THAT'S OUR CHAMBER, MAN. Narrator: SO JACK SETS UP  A PRECISION CHARGE TO CAREFULLY BREAK THROUGH IT. -THERE IT GOES.  -THERE IT GOES. -GO. GO. GO. GO.  -WHOA! Jeremy: SHAWN, HOW'S IT LOOK? Shawn: OH [BLEEP] WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? I THINK THEY BURIED THEIR HORDE  UNDERNEATH A BIG LAKE. OH, GEEZ. Shawn: IT'S WATER  AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. Jeremy: LOOK AT [BLEEP] I DON'T GET IT, MAN. THAT'S NOT WHAT  I EXPECTED TO SEE. MY HEART JUST DROPPED. THERE'S THIS HUGE LAKE  ON THE OTHER SIDE -- A LAKE IN THE MIDDLE  OF A MOUNTAIN. IF IT'S SOMETHING  THAT HAPPENED OVER TIME JUST BY NATURE --  ANOTHER ISSUE. BUT IT'S OBVIOUS  THE JESUITS KNEW ABOUT IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY  THEY BUILT THE WALL AND HOW WATERTIGHT THEY MADE IT,  YOU KNOW, LOGICALLY, THIS WAS SOMETHING  THAT JESUITS DID PURPOSELY. I MEAN, IT'S THE BEST WAY  TO HIDE SOMETHING. SO IT'S A WHOLE, WHOLE NOTHER  SET OF PROBLEMS, BUT, YOU KNOW,  WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. CLOCK'S TICKING RIGHT NOW. WE GOT WATER COMING  THROUGH THE ROOF. WE NEED TO DIVE THIS THING. YOU MIGHT BE WALKING  RIGHT ON TOP OF GOLD BARS. YOU DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT MIGHT BE RIGHT  UNDERNEATH THAT WATER. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S  IN THAT WATER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUMP  INTO THE WATER HERE WITHOUT TAKING  A LOT OF PRECAUTION. WE SHOULD GET  THE UNDERWATER METAL DETECTOR AND DETECT  AROUND THE EDGES. JUST TAKE IT SLOW. TEST AROUND THE EDGE, ALL RIGHT? Shawn: THIS WATER,  IT LOOKS LIKE A CESSPOOL. IT'S BEEN STAGNANT  FOR 300 YEARS. IT'S FULL OF NASTY BACTERIA, SOME OF THAT MIGHT BE  FLESH-EATING BACTERIA. 300 YEARS OF BAT GUANO,  IT'S ALL IN THAT WATER. BUT YOU CAN'T DENY THAT  THE TREASURE MIGHT BE THERE, SO WE WILL USE OUR  UNDERWATER METAL DETECTOR TO DO WHAT WE CAN  AROUND THE PERIMETER WITHOUT SUBMERGING OURSELVES, AND IF WE FIND  SOMETHING WORTHWHILE, THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST PATH FOR IT. I'M GOING TO MAKE MYSELF AN EXTENSION SO I CAN GO DEEPER. Narrator: JEREMY FASTENS  THE UNDERWATER METAL DETECTOR TO A BAMBOO STEM  TO EXTEND ITS REACH. AS THE CORD FOR THE HEADPHONES  NEEDED TO DETECT UNDERWATER IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO WEAR, JEREMY RESTS THE HEADPHONES  ON THE BAMBOO POLE AND TURNS UP ITS VOLUME  TO THE MAX. Jack: OH, THERE YOU GO. GET THAT UP THERE  WHERE YOU CAN HEAR IT. GUYS, THERE'S A LOT MORE WATER  COMING IN THROUGH THIS CEILING. YOU NOTICE THAT'S FILLING UP  DOWN BY YOUR FEET, JACK? YEAH, I KNOW. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  TO SPEED THIS UP. OKAY. I'M GOING. I'M GOING.  I'M GOING. IT MIGHT LOOK RIDICULOUS, BUT AS LONG AS IT WORKS... I THINK IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.  LET'S GET IT IN THE WATER. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] WHOA. ARE YOU GETTING SOMETHING? MAN,  THAT WATER'S NASTY. -IT IS.  -UGH. [ METAL DETECTOR WHINES ] -DID YOU HEAR THAT, JAV?  -YEAH, I HEARD IT. -GUYS, I GOT A HIT.  -YOU GOT A HIT? WE GOT A HIT! Shawn: HOW ARE WE GOING  TO GET IT OUT? MAYBE WE COULD RIG  SOMETHING UP. WE GOT THOSE BIG SOUP CANS --  TURN THAT INTO A SCOOP. DO IT.  JUST PUNCH HOLES IN IT, AND GET SOMETHING TO STICK  ON THE END OF IT. I GET A HIT ALMOST  RIGHT OFF THE BAT -- CENTER OF THE HOLE,  ABOUT FOUR FEET DOWN. I WANT TO GET INTO THIS LAKE  AND SEARCH AS MUCH AS I CAN BECAUSE I THINK  WE'RE CLOSING IN ON THIS HUNT. I GOT A SCOOP.  HERE. THAT'LL WORK. CAN YOU MAKE ANOTHER BIG HOLE  ON THIS SIDE? YEP. [ METAL RATTLES ] PERFECT. ALL RIGHT, LITTLE PARACORD. PERFECT.  Shawn: THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. ♪♪ COME ON. HOW DEEP IS IT RIGHT THERE  DO YOU THINK? FOUR FEET, MAYBE.  MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE. PUT YOUR HAND, JAV. [ WATER TRICKLES ] NOTHING. THAT WATER'S FREEZING. -IS IT?  -YEAH. THAT'S NOT GOOD. OH, I THINK  I GOT SOMETHING NOW. I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.  [ GRUNTS ] THERE'S SOMETHING HERE. WHAT IS IT? ALL RIGHT. CAN ALWAYS TURN  THE METAL DETECTOR BACK AROUND, TOO, JEREMY.  YOU KNOW? SEE?  LOOK AT THIS. DID YOU GET SOMETHING? HA HA! COIN, GUYS!  LOOK AT THIS! COIN!  WE GOT A COIN! WE GOT A COIN RIGHT THERE! LET ME SEE.  LET ME SEE. HEY, HEY, JEREMY,  CHECK THAT OUT. OH, WE GOT MORE COINS, GUYS. THERE'S TWO RIGHT THERE.  I SEE TWO. BRING THEM OVER HERE. BRING THEM OVER HERE. -WHAT IS IT?  -IT'S A PIECE OF EIGHT. IT IS. IT'S A PIECE OF EIGHT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THIS WAS THEIR MONEY  BACK THEN. PIECES OF IT WOULD BUY YOU THINGS, SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ALL VERY ROUGH AND CRUDE, RIGHT? Shawn: JAVIER JUST FOUND  A PIECE OF EIGHT, WHICH IS THE CURRENCY  OF THE SPANISH EMPIRE BOTH IN EUROPE  AND IN SOUTH AMERICA AS EARLY AS THE 1300s. THIS PIECE HAS SIGNIFICANT  MARKINGS ON IT. THERE'S THE CROSS REPRESENTING  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, AND THERE ARE ALSO  CASTLES AND LIONS, WHICH REPRESENT CASTILE  AND LEON, THE TWO MOST PROMINENT  SPANISH PROVINCES THAT UNITED TO FORM THE MOST POWERFUL GOVERNMENT  IN THE WORLD. AND THERE'S ALSO  A DEPICTION OF A PILLAR. THEY REPRESENT  THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR, CONSIDERED TO BE THE GATEWAY  BETWEEN THE OLD WORLD -- EUROPE -- AND THE NEW WORLD --  THE AMERICAS. THIS SYMBOL  WAS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO HEAD OUT TO THE NEW WORLD  IN SEARCH OF TREASURE. ALL THESE MARKINGS  UNDOUBTEDLY CONFIRM THAT WE HAVE  SPANISH COINS HERE. ♪♪ Shawn: THEY WOULD HAVE PUT THE DATE, AND THEY WOULD ONLY USE  THREE NUMBERS. THE ONE WAS OBVIOUS. I THINK I SEE A SIX, A NINE,  AND A FOUR. 1694. -THAT MAKES SENSE.  -MAKES SENSE. IT'S BEFORE THE JESUITS WERE EXPELLED. Shawn: I'M RUBBING OFF THESE COINS -- I CAN CLEARLY SEE THESE COINS ARE ALL PRIOR TO THE JESUITS LEAVING  THIS AREA. THESE ARE THE RIGHT COINS  OF THE RIGHT ERA OF THE TREASURE  WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IT MAKES ME  MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT THAT THESE COINS  ARE A PART OF THE TREASURE AND THAT WE'RE MOMENTS AWAY FROM FINDING SOMETHING  SIGNIFICANT UNDER THIS LAKE. I'M TELLING YOU, OUR TREASURE IS RIGHT BEYOND THAT WALL. IT'S HERE. ♪♪ Narrator: WHILE INVESTIGATING  THE SHALLOW EDGE OF THE RESERVOIR HIDDEN  DEEP INSIDE THE HILL... Jeremy:  GUYS, I GOT A HIT. -YOU GOT A HIT?  -WE GOT A COIN RIGHT THERE! LET ME SEE.  LET ME SEE. Narrator: ...THE TEAM  FINDS SPANISH SILVER COINS FROM THE 1600s... -WE GOT MORE COINS, GUYS.  -IT'S A PIECE OF EIGHT. Narrator:  ...THE STRONGEST INDICATOR YET THAT THE TREASURE MIGHT  BE LYING SUBMERGED BELOW. SO WE'RE HOLDING PART  OF THE TREASURE RIGHT NOW. Jeremy:  I HAVE NO DOUBT, MAN. IT'S THE SAME TIME PERIOD. I MEAN, THAT THING  IS IN GOOD CONDITION. I MEAN, THIS WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN IN THIS GOOD OF SHAPE IF THIS WAS BURIED AT SEA -- SALTWATER WOULD HAVE EATEN  THIS THING UP. THAT MAKES OUR TREASURE  WORTH A LOT MORE THAN IF IT WAS LOST  AT SEA. Jack:  WE'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT, GUYS. -LET'S KEEP LOOKING.  -YEAH, MAN. THERE COULD BE MORE THERE. Jeremy: LET ME JUST HOP IN  AND FIND WHAT I CAN FIND. WAIT A MINUTE, I DON'T WANT YOU GOING IN THE WATER, MAN. I DON'T WANT TO JUST GO IN THERE BLIND AND RUN INTO SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS. SEE, I DON'T CARE ABOUT  RUNNING IN THERE BLIND. I MEAN, I CAN CLOSE MY EYES,  DIVE DOWN, FEEL AROUND, DETECT,  DO THE WHOLE THING. WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL. I'M RUNNING THIS EXPEDITION, I'M ALSO THE SENIOR DIVE OFFICER HERE. I HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE. I'VE HAD PEOPLE GET KILLED  ON MY EXPEDITIONS. YOU'RE NOT GOING  TO BE THE NEXT ONE. RIGHT NOW, I JUST WANT TO DO A GOOD RECONNAISSANCE AND MAKE SURE  THAT WE'RE SAFE. Shawn: WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE  OF NOWHERE, DEEP IN A TUNNEL  UNDERNEATH A MOUNTAIN, AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  FREE-DIVING IN A LAKE IN THIS SITUATION  THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE BACTERIA'S LIKE,  HOW TOXIC IT MIGHT BE. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY  NO VISIBILITY. JEREMY'S A GREAT FREE-DIVER,  BUT ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS, HE DIVES DOWN, HE GETS  SNAGGED ON SOMETHING, HE'S DONE. THAT'S NOT EVEN  TO BRING UP THE FACT THAT WE'RE AT LIKE  10,000 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL. THE LEVEL OF OXYGEN HERE IS A LOT LESS  THAN IT IS AT SEA LEVEL. HE THINKS HE WANTS TO GO  FREE-DIVING IN THERE? NO FRICKING WAY. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT ABOUT THIS --  I MEAN, IF I POP IN, I CAN METAL DETECT  THE SHALLOW AREAS. I CAN ALSO TAKE THAT BOOM POLE. AND WHAT IF I PUT  A CAMERA AND A LIGHT AND POKE DOWN,  LIKE, INTO THE HOLE? I MEAN, IT MIGHT CLEAR UP. IT MIGHT JUST BE DIRTY WATER  ON TOP AND CLEAR BELOW. WE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET A SHOT  OF SOMETHING. YOU DON'T KNOW. WAIT A MINUTE.  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOPPING IN AND CONTINUING TO METAL DETECT  AROUND THE FOUR FOOT RANGE. YEAH. AS MUCH AS I CAN, YEAH. YOU CAN'T GO  ABOVE YOUR WAIST. WE CAN'T ALLOW YOU  TO GET YOUR LACERATION WET. WE DON'T KNOW  WHAT'S IN THIS WATER, AND THAT BACTERIA  GETS IN THAT CUT, WE'RE IN A WORLD  OF HELL. -I WON'T PUSH IT.  -ALL RIGHT. SO THE COMPROMISE WAS, JEREMY, YOU CAN GO IN  NO DEEPER THAN YOUR WAIST. SO WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN  WITHOUT SUBMERGING OURSELVES. -ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT, MAN.  -LET'S DO THIS. WHAT DO YOU NEED HERE  TO RIG THIS UP? GOPRO, LIGHT, AND I LIKE THE DETECTOR JUST THE WAY IT IS. THE FACT THAT THERE'S COINS  SITTING THERE TELLS ME THAT  THERE'S MORE STUFF HERE. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS, I'M GOING TO ATTACH A SMALL  CAMERA TO THE METAL DETECTOR -- JUST KIND OF TURN AROUND  AND JUST SEE AS FAR AS I CAN. YOU KNOW, SEE IF THERE'S ANY NICHES OR ANYTHING AROUND THERE. OH, MY GOD!  THAT'S FREEZING! OHH.  OHH. OH, MY GOD.  THAT'S FREEZING. WHOO!  HERE. HERE. WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO. WHOO.  PHEW. HERE.

Narrator: HYPOTHERMIA  IS A SUDDEN AND DANGEROUS DROP IN BODY TEMPERATURE CAUSED BY EXPOSURE  TO EXTREMELY COLD WATER OR AIR. THE WATER IN THIS LAKE IS BETWEEN 40 AND 50 DEGREES  FAHRENHEIT. IT CAN TURN JEREMY HYPOTHERMIC  IN UNDER AN HOUR. IF LEFT UNTREATED, HE WOULD LOSE  BLOOD PRESSURE, MOTOR CONTROL, AND POSSIBLY DIE  IN UNDER 90 MINUTES. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.  THAT'S ENOUGH. HERE, SOMEBODY GRAB THIS. JACK, GRAB THE POLE.  -OKAY. OKAY. OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T FEEL  MY BOTTOM EXTREMITIES AT ALL. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET  JEREMY OUT FIRST. WE GOT TO GET  JEREMY OUT. OHH. OHH. YOU ALL RIGHT?  PHEW. GO GET DRY. THE WATER IS  ABSOLUTELY FREEZING. I MEAN, IF YOU DUCK YOUR HEAD  INTO THAT WATER -- INSTANT HEADACHE. AND WHAT KIND OF MADE IT WORSE IS THAT YOU GET ABOUT  FOUR FEET ON THE EDGE, THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,  IT'S LIKE IT'S A HOLE. I MEAN, IT SEEMS TO BE A MUCH  DEEPER, BIGGER CAVITY BELOW, AND IF SO, YOU CAN'T GET  A MORE SECURE, SECRETIVE CHAMBER THAN A MASSIVE  UNDERWATER CAVERN. SO IT REALLY MAKES ME CURIOUS  ABOUT THE REST OF THE LAKE. WE'LL SEE  WHAT KIND OF FOOTAGE WE'VE GOT. -HEY, MAN, YOU GOOD AND DRY?  -YEAH. ALL RIGHT, LET'S LOOK  AT THIS FOOTAGE. MAN, IT'S SO MURKY. YOU CAN'T SEE NOTHING. I MEAN, THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL. Jeremy: PULLED THE GOPRO OUT,  LOOKED AT SOME OF THE FOOTAGE. THE CASE IS KIND OF FOGGED UP. I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY  WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANY DETAIL, REALLY, ON THIS. YEAH, THIS SCREEN'S  WAY TOO SMALL. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL JUST HAVE  TO CHECK IT OUT ON A BIGGER SCREEN LATER. STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT  WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. WE CAN'T MAKE A MOVE  BEFORE WE WORK OUT THE AREA, AND WE NEED TO EXPLORE. ALL RIGHT.  LET'S DO THIS -- LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY  TO MEASURE THE DEPTH. ALL RIGHT.  GIVE ME LINE. PARACORD.  PARACORD WILL WORK. WE NEED SOMETHING LONGER,  THOUGH. I WANT SOMETHING  LONGER THAN THIS. I WANT TO REACH  WAY OUT THERE. YOU MEAN LIKE A POLE? BOOM POLE. CAN I BORROW  YOUR BOOM POLE? THAT'LL WORK. OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T HAVE  A DEPTH SOUNDER, ANY GEAR LIKE THAT  BECAUSE WE WEREN'T EXPECTING -- WE'RE NOT PREPARED FOR WATER. SO TO FIGURE OUT THE DEPTH, WE'RE USING WHAT THEY CALL  A LEAD LINE. THE LEAD LINE, IN THIS CASE,  I'M USING A ROCK AS WEIGHT, WE'VE GOT IT TIED TO A LINE,  THE LINE HAS MARKS ON IT. EACH ONE OF THOSE MARKS  REPRESENTS A FATHOM, OR SIX FEET, AND I'M USING A BOOM POLE  TO MOVE IT OUT. PRETTY MUCH LIKE IF YOU CAN  IMAGINE A FISHING POLE WITH A WEIGHT ON IT. AND SO WE JUST TAKE  THE BOOM POLE OUT THERE, FEED THE LINE OUT  TILL IT HITS THE BOTTOM. LINE GOES SLACK,  THAT'S HOW DEEP IT IS. IS THAT GOING TO WORK? YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.  THAT LOOKS GREAT, MAN. ALL RIGHT.  GIVE ME MY POLE. I THINK IF YOU COULD GET THIS  ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE MIDDLE, THAT WOULD BE  OUR BEST MEASUREMENT. ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,  HERE YOU GO. I GOT YOU. -YOU SEE THAT MARK RIGHT THERE?  -YEAH, YEAH. SIDE'S ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET.  THAT'S NOT BAD. I'M GOING TO GO A LITTLE BIT PAST WHERE THE DETECTOR WAS. ♪♪ I GOT 12 FEET RIGHT HERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, I'M ALL THE WAY OUT ABOUT AS FAR AS I CAN GO. -YOU'RE OUT IN THE MIDDLE?  -YEAH. Javier:  BUT IT'S STILL GOING. I'M AT 18. YOU WATCH THE MARKS, JAV. YEAH, IT'S STILL GOING.  [BLEEP] IT'S DROPPING QUICK. 24. ♪♪ STILL GOING, BRO. WE'RE GETTING DOWN  TO THE WIRE HERE. THERE'S NOT A LOT  OF LINE LEFT. 60 FEET.  70 FEET. 70 FEET? DUDE,  YOU GOT ONE METER LEFT. UGH. THAT'S THE BITTER END.  DON'T LET THAT GO. I'M AT THE BOTTOM  RIGHT HERE. HOLY [BLEEP] THAT'S ALMOST 100 FEET. Javier:  THIS IS AN UNDERWATER CAVE. Shawn: HOW IN HELL ARE WE GOING  TO DIVE A 100 FOOT LAKE? ♪♪ Shawn: WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH  THIS FALSE WALL. YOU KNOW MY SOLUTION -- PUT A SMALL CHARGE  UP THERE AND PUNCH THROUGH  THE TOP. Jack:  IT MAY NOT SEEM OBVIOUS, BUT EXPLOSIVES  AND DEMOLITION GEAR CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR MAJOR  TREASURE-HUNTING EXPEDITION. MOST TREASURE HUNTS  AROUND THE WORLD TAKE PLACE IN VERY REMOTE,  INACCESSIBLE AREAS. IT'S ACTUALLY DANGEROUS  TO DIG UNDERGROUND IN THESE CAVED-IN AREAS. THE BEST AND SAFEST WAY  OF DOING THAT IS ACTUALLY USING EXPLOSIVES. WE'RE DEALING  WITH ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES THAT ARE HIDING ARTIFACTS  OF GREAT VALUE. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS SET UP  SURGICALLY PRECISE CHARGES OF VARIOUS STRENGTHS  AND DIRECTION SO WE CAN CLEAR OUR PATH BUT NOT  DAMAGE ANY POTENTIAL ARTIFACTS. AND I HAVE TO ADMIT, TOO,  IT NEVER GETS OLD. THERE IT GOES.  LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ EXHALES SHARPLY ]  OH! GEEZ LOUISE. Narrator: WHILE INVESTIGATING  THE SHALLOW EDGE OF THE RESERVOIR HIDDEN  DEEP INSIDE THE HILL... [ METAL DETECTOR WHINES ]  Jeremy: I GOT A HIT. Javier:  HEY, WE GOT SOMETHING. Narrator: ...THE TEAM FINDS  SPANISH SILVER COINS FROM THE 1600s... -RIGHT HERE.  -LIKE TWO ROYALS. I GOT YOU. Narrator: ...BUT WHEN THEY MEASURE THE DEPTH OF THE POOL... IT'S DROPPING QUICK. ...THEY REALIZE THEY'RE DEALING  WITH A MASSIVE UNDERWATER CAVE. I'M AT THE BOTTOM  RIGHT HERE. IT IS AT LEAST 100 FEET DEEP. Shawn: HOW IN HELL ARE WE GOING  TO DIVE A 100 FOOT LAKE? ♪♪ -100 FEET.  -OKAY. [ SIGHS ] THAT'S A WHOLE  'NOTHER SET OF PROBLEMS. I MEAN, THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A MASSIVE DIVING OPERATION WHETHER IT'D BE  DREDGING OR DIVING. EITHER WAY, IT'S GOING TO TAKE  A MAJOR EXPEDITION, AND THAT'S SOMETHING  WE'RE NOT READY FOR. I'VE SPENT ALL MY ADULT LIFE WORKING  AS A PROFESSIONAL DIVER -- PURSUING SHIPWRECKS AT DEPTHS OF GREATER THAN 350 FEET. BUT I'M TELLING YOU,  MAKING A DEEP DIVE IN AN UNDERWATER CAVE  IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS. WHAT'S WORSE -- THIS EXPEDITION  ISN'T OUTFITTED TO DO A MAJOR  UNDERWATER EXPLORATION. WE'RE NOT EVEN EQUIPPED  WITH BASIC SCUBA GEAR, AND WHAT WE WOULD NEED HERE IS A LOT MORE  THAN BASIC SCUBA GEAR. YOU GOT TO REMEMBER,  WE'RE IN THE ANDES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  HIGH-ALTITUDE DIVING, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WATER  THAT'S EXTREMELY COLD. I'M SURE IT'S FULL  OF 300 YEARS OF BAT GUANO, AND IT COULD VERY WELL LEAD  TO A BACTERIAL INFECTION THAT'LL SHUT DOWN  YOUR LUNGS AND KIDNEYS IN A VERY SHORT  AMOUNT OF TIME. SO AS EAGER AS EVERYBODY IS, I DON'T WANT ANYBODY  GOING IN THIS WATER. GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK,  REGROUP, RE-OUTFIT, AND PLAN FOR TREASURE DIVING. THAT'S LIKE REBREATHER, TANKS,  COMPRESSORS, HYPERBARIC. Shawn: SCUBA EQUIPMENT, CLOSED-CIRCUIT,  REBREATHERS, DRY SUITS, BRING IN A WHOLE TYPE  OF DREDGE SYSTEM. Narrator: BOLIVIA IS A LAND-LOCKED COUNTRY WITH ALMOST  NO DIVING INFRASTRUCTURE, SO THE TEAM WILL NEED  TO FLY TO BRAZIL OR EVEN BACK TO THE STATES  TO ACQUIRE ALL THE DIVE AND SAFETY GEAR  THEY NEED -- A PROCESS THAT WOULD BE  VERY TIME AND MONEY INTENSIVE. Shawn:  SECURING ALL THAT EQUIPMENT, PLANNING  THIS VERY TECHNICAL DIVE, THAT'S GOING TO TAKE MANY WEEKS,  IF NOT MONTHS. WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS  BEFORE EVERY EXIT AND ENTRY POINT  INTO THIS VALLEY IS GOING TO BE  COMPLETELY UNDERWATER. UNFORTUNATELY,  THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY. Jeremy: I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY  WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT 100-FOOT DROP-OFF. THAT'S OUT OF OUR REACH  FOR NOW. Javier:  JUST LEAVE LIKE THAT? NO, COME ON.  LET'S THINK. Shawn: JAVI, DIVING A 100-FOOT  CAVE WITHOUT PROPER GEAR? WE'D BE PUTTING OURSELVES  AT AN EXTREME RISK. THERE'S JUST NO WAY  WE'D EVEN REACH THE BOTTOM. IT DOESN'T MAKE  ANY SENSE. WE GOT TO GO. WE'RE RISKING OUR LIVES  RIGHT NOW. WE'RE OUT OF TIME. WE JUST HAVE TO REGROUP  AND COME BACK AND DO IT RIGHT. THE TREASURE'S THERE.  WE'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN. LET'S PACK IT UP. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE  BEFORE WE'RE STUCK HERE. WRAP IT UP.  WRAP IT UP. LET'S DO THIS. Jack: I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT IT'S JUST FREAKING PAINFUL,  YOU KNOW? Jeremy: THIS IS BEYOND  OUR TECHNICAL ABILITIES WITH THE TOOLS  WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IT'S RIGHT OUT OF YOUR REACH,  AND YOU KNOW IF YOU GO FOR IT, THAT COULD BE THE END OF YOU, SO WE'VE COME TO AN IMPASSE. I DON'T LIKE LEAVING RIGHT NOW,  BUT I WON'T BE GONE LONG. IT'S NOT THE END CHAPTER. YOU KNOW,  THAT'S YET TO BE WRITTEN. LET'S GO. ♪♪ [ WIND BLOWING ] Jack: WHOA!  THERE'S A STORM COMING IN. I MEAN, WHEN IT HITS HERE,  IT HITS FAST AND HARD. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] THE DRIVING EMOTION  IS THAT WE GOT TO GO, AND, YOU KNOW,  I GUESS I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WE'VE COME SO CLOSE. YOU KNOW,  TO PACK UP AND LEAVE ADDS AN ELEMENT OF FRUSTRATION  I CAN'T EXPLAIN TO YOU. IT'S GETTING CLOSER,  GUYS. YOU'RE THAT LINE. ♪♪ Shawn:  WE'VE COME A LONG WAY. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF UPS,  A LOT OF DOWNS. WE WERE ON A BIG "UP" HERE. WE THOUGHT WE WERE MOMENTS AWAY  FROM MAKING HISTORY AND FINDING  THE WORLD'S LARGEST TREASURE. SO IT'S TOUGH UNDERSTANDING  THAT WE CAN DO NO MORE AND WE ARE OUT OF TIME. BUT AT THE SAME TIME,  IT'S NOT OVER. IT'S JUST OVER FOR NOW. WE'RE COMING BACK,  AND WE'RE GOING TO GET IT  ALL IN ONE SWOOP. WE'RE COMING BACK  STRONGER THAN EVER.
