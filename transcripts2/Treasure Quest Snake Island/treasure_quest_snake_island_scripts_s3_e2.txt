 THE TREASURE IS DOWN  UNDERNEATH THE MONASTERY. Narrator: ...AND INTEL FROM  THE CENTURY OF PAST ATTEMPTS, WILL USE CUTTING-EDGE  TECHNOLOGY... ...AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT, TO TAKE THE VALLEY'S  DANGERS HEAD ON. [ BELL RINGS ]  GET DOWN! AND IF THEY CAN SOLVE THE  MYSTERY OF THE SACAMBAYA, THEY CAN FIND THE TRAIL  TO THE TREASURE. -JEREMY!  -HOLD TIGHT! THREE, TWO, ONE. INCOMING!

LIFELONG TREASURE HUNTER  SHAWN COWLES AND HIS TEAM VENTURED INTO BOLIVIA'S  SACAMBAYA VALLEY... -IS THAT AN AVALANCHE?  -RUN, RUN, RUN! ...TO TRACK DOWN A  MASSIVE JESUIT FORTUNE... Shawn: THIS WOULD BE THE  WORLD'S BIGGEST LAND FIND TREASURE IN HISTORY. Narrator: ...EQUIPPED WITH  CRITICAL INFORMATION PASSED ON TO THEM BY  THE LAST LIVING MEMBER OF A MAJOR EXPEDITION TO HAVE SEARCHED FOR  THE SACAMBAYA GOLD. I WAS HAVING REMARKABLE  HITS AROUND LA PLAZUELA. THEY HONED IN ON THE  RUINS OF A MONASTERY, THAT THEY BELIEVE LIES  NEAR THE UNDERGROUND VAULTS HOLDING THE TREASURE. [ DETECTOR BEEPING ] Shawn: THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD HIT. -THERE'S SOMETHIN' IN HERE.  -THAT IS DEFINITELY SILVER. Shawn:  THIS WAS A CEREMONIAL CHALICE. AND THIS COULD BE PART OF  THE TREASURE SACAMBAYA. ♪♪ ♪♪ WHAT AN AMAZING FIND. VERY LIKELY THIS WAS  USED FOR COMMUNION. I WONDER IF THEY SMELTED IT DOWN  FROM ALL THE SILVER AND GOLD THAT THEY WERE RUNNING  THROUGH LA PLAZUELA. YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE  THEY COULD'VE CAST IT. LA PLAZUELA WAS A REPOSITORY FOR  12 MAJOR MINES IN THIS AREA. HOARDS AND HOARDS  OF SILVER AND GOLD ARE BEING FUNNELED RIGHT  DOWN HERE TO THIS DEPOSITORY. BUT THERE'S NO  RECORDS OF THE SPANISH EVER GETTING IT OUT OF HERE. AND THERE'S ALSO NO  RECORDS OF THE JESUITS EVER PULLING ANY  TREASURE OUT OF HERE. SO FINDING THIS CHALICE AND  SEEING SO MUCH OVERGROWTH, GIVES ME HUGE AMOUNT  OF HOPE AND CONFIDENCE. IT TELLS ME THAT NOBODY'S  BEEN DIGGING HERE. AND WHATEVER WAS BURIED  HERE IN LA PLAZUELA, WERE 300 YEARS AGO,  IT'S STILL HERE. I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT  LA PLAZUELA IS THE RIGHT SPOT. AND IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE  THAT WE CONCENTRATE RIGHT HERE. THOSE JESUITS, THEY  WERE PRETTY TRICKY. RIGHT.  WHEN THE SPANISH ARMIES WERE COMIN' UP IN 1767, THE JESUITS, YOU KNOW  THEY HAD THIS WINDOW AND WHAT'S THE BEST  THING THEY COULD DO? DIG A HOLE AND HIDE IT. Narrator:  IN 1767, THE KING OF SPAIN GROWS ENVIOUS OF THE  WEALTH ACCUMULATED BY SPANISH JESUIT  MISSIONARIES IN SOUTH AMERICA. AND ACCORDING TO LEGEND,  WHEN HE ORDERS THEM TO RETURN TO EUROPE, A GROUP  OF JESUITS FROM LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY IN THE SACAMBAYA  VALLEY GOES ROGUE. AND HIDES THEIR MASSIVE  STOCKPILE OF GOLD IN AN UNDERGROUND VAULT. THEY ALSO LEAVE  BEHIND A LETTER KNOWN AS THE THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT, WHICH CLAIMS THAT THE VAULT  IS BURIED IN A FLAT-TOP HILL NEAR THE CONFLUENCE OF  THREE RIVERS IN THE VALLEY. OVER THE NEXT THREE CENTURIES,  SIX MAJOR EXPEDITIONS SEARCHED FOR THE GOLD. BUT NONE LOOKED IN THE  AREA THAT IS THE FOCUS OF SHAWN'S EXPEDITION. SO IF IT NEVER  MOVED OUT OF HERE, THEN THE LOGICAL  ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT HAS TO STILL BE HERE  AT THE REPOSITORY. IT'S JUST A MATTER  OF US FIGURIN' OUT WHERE THE HELL IT IS. HAVING FOUND A CHALICE IN  THE MONASTERY COMPOUND, I WANT TO CONTINUE  SWEEPING THE WHOLE AREA WITH METAL DETECTORS. I WANT TO SEE WHAT  ELSE WE CAN FIND. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SPLIT UP. JEREMY AND JAVIER, THEY'RE  GONNA FINE-TOOTH COMB THE AREA WHERE WE FOUND THE  CHALICE AND THEN MOVE OUTWARDS TOWARDS THE PERIMETER  WALLS OF THE COMPOUND. AND JACK AND I, WE'RE  GONNA SWEEP THROUGH THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COMPLEX. NOT ONLY METAL DETECTING,  BUT ALSO LOOKING OUT FOR ANY UNDERGROUND PASSAGES, OR ANY CLUES AMONG  THE RUINS THAT MIGHT PUT US ON THE RIGHT TRAIL. -OKAY.  -SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. ♪♪ WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE IN THERE. SO WE JUST DIG IT UP AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND. [ DETECTOR BEEPING ] WE GOT SOMETHIN', JAV. LOOK. ♪♪ IT'S JUST A ROCK,  IT'S QUARTZ. LET ME SEE.  [ DETECTOR BEEPING ] IT'S THE OXIDE FROM  THE IRON, QUARTZ. THERE'S MINERALS  IN THE ROCKS. METAL DETECTING HERE,  IT'S OBSTACLES. THIS IS A MINING AREA,  AND SO IT'S MINERAL RICH. AND WE COULD GET  A FALSE READING. AND SO THAT COMPLICATES  FINDING ARTIFACTS. IT SLOWS EVERYTHING DOWN. SO A BIT FRUSTRATING. WELL, I SEE  THIS HOLE'S DEAD. LET'S KEEP  METAL DETECTING. LET'S GO UP TO THE TOP  AND WORK OUR WAY DOWN. OKAY. ♪♪ MAN, THIS BRUSH IS INCREDIBLE. IN SOME WAYS, IT MAKES  ME MORE CONFIDENT. IT SHOWS THAT NOBODY'S BEEN HERE  IN A LONG TIME. YEAH, NOBODY'S BEEN HERE  FOR A LONG TIME. CAN YOU GET IN THERE?  YEAH. HANG ON. THERE'S A PATH  RIGHT HERE. [ GROANING ] [ DETECTOR BEEPING ] I GOT A PRETTY GOOD  HIT RIGHT HERE. GOT A HIT? RIGHT THERE, OR LIKE  THE BASE OF THAT ROCK. ♪♪ THAT'S WHAT WE WERE HITTING ON RIGHT THERE. IRON. IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF  STRAPPING OR SOMETHING. MAYBE PART OF A  HINGE-THROUGH DOOR. IT COULD'VE BEEN A DOOR -- LOOK AT THIS. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING, JACK? I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING. NO, WAIT, THERE IT IS. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? IT'S FAINT.  WOW, WAIT A MINUTE. IT'S OLD, MAYBE. OH, THERE YOU GO. [ BLEEP ] MAN. ♪♪ THAT'S MAN-MADE. THERE'S NO WAY THIS  IS A RANDOM ENGRAVING. I MEAN IT'S CARVED RIGHT  NEXT TO THE MONASTERY. THIS IS A MARKER. Shawn: THE JESUITS ARE FAMOUS  FOR STONE MAPS AND MARKINGS. THEY USED A LOT OF SYMBOLOGY. AND THAT'S BEEN GOIN' ON  FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. THEY'D LEAVE THESE  CRYPTIC MESSAGES TO POINT THEIR FELLOW PRIESTS  IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT FOR ALL OTHERS IT MIGHT  BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OR  WHERE THEY WERE POINTING TO. IT'S SO FAMILIAR. BUT WHAT? JEREMY, JAVIER. Jeremy: GO AHEAD, SHAWN. WE GOT A MARKING HERE. YOU GOT TO COME  CHECK THIS OUT. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD GIVE US A BETTER CLUE OR ANYTHING. I THINK  I KNOW WHAT IT IS. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? SEE THIS PYRAMID?  AH. AND A CIRCLE?  CIRCLE? COULD THIS BE THE EYE  OF THE PROVIDENCE? THE ALL-SEEING EYE  OVER THE PYRAMID? YEP, GOD LOOKING  OVER THE PEOPLE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT  IT, THE ILLUMINATI, THE FREEMASONS,  THE JESUITS. THEY ALL REFER TO THE  EYE OF THE PROVIDENCE. HERE. ♪♪ IT'S THE GREAT SEAL  OF THE U.S. YOU SEE IT?  YEAH. THE PYRAMID. ♪♪ SO WHY IS A SYMBOL, HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD IN BOLIVIA, MATCHING WHAT'S ON OUR CURRENT U.S. $1 BILL? THE SYMBOL, IT'S MUCH  OLDER THAN THE U.S. THAT SYMBOL HAS BEEN USED FOR  THOUSANDS OF YEARS REALLY. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, THERE'S  NO EYE INSIDE THE OVAL PART. YEAH, IT'S EYE SHAPED, BUT THERE'S NO PUPIL, YOU MEAN. RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW, MAN. Shawn: THIS COULD BE NOTHING  OR IT COULD BE A MAJOR CLUE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. ♪♪ Shawn: MAN, THIS BRUSH  IS INCREDIBLE. Narrator: SHAWN AND JACK  ARE COMBING THROUGH THE MONASTERY OF LA PLAZUELA  IN SEARCH OF NOT ONLY MORE JESUIT ARTIFACTS, BUT ALSO  UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAYS THAT MAY LIE CONCEALED  AMONG THE RUINS. Jack: LOOK AT THIS. WHEN THEY COME ACROSS  A MYSTERIOUS STONE ENGRAVING. Shawn:  THIS IS A MARKER. THIS COULD BE NOTHING, OR  IT COULD BE A MAJOR CLUE. WE NEED TO KNOW  WHAT THIS MEANS. Jeremy:  SHAWN, GUIDE US OUT. HEY, GUYS!  KEEP COMIN' STRAIGHT DOWN GUYS. CHECK THIS OUT. YOU GOT TO SEE THIS. Shawn:  DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS? I MEAN.  [ SIGHING ] IF IT'S RELIGIOUS,  A TRIANGLE CAN MEAN THE FATHER, THE SON  AND THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THIS IS NOT A TRIANGLE. YOU KNOW,  THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. JAVIER,  DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY? YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO REALLY  KNOWS THE HISTORY IN THIS AREA. YOU KNOW WHAT? A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, HE LIVES OVER  THE NEXT VALLEY. MAYBE, YOU KNOW, FOUR OR FIVE HOURS' HIKE. AND HIS FAMILY HAS A LOT OF HISTORY IN THIS AREA. AND HE KNOWS A LOT  ABOUT THE TREASURE. WE GO WITH A PICTURE OF THIS AND SEE WHAT HE HAS TO THINK ABOUT IT. AND HE'S A CLOSE FRIEND  OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY'S? YEAH, VERY CLOSE. I'M SURE WE  CAN TRUST HIM. I MEAN, IF YOU THINK  HE CAN REALLY HELP, I THINK THAT'S A  HIKE WORTH TAKIN'. YEAH. OKAY, LET ME CALL HIM. LET'S GO GRAB  A CELLPHONE. YEAH, WE GOT TO DOCUMENT THIS. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] Narrator: THE TEAM SETS OFF  ON A SIX-MILE TREK TO THE ADJACENT  VALLEY OF BOCA TOMA TO MEET UP WITH A  FRIEND OF JAVIER'S, TO SEE IF THE STONE  MARKER CARRIES ANY USEFUL INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BRING  THEM CLOSER TO THE TREASURE. ♪♪ THIS IS LIKE SOMETHIN'  OUT OF THE OLD WEST. THIS IS DAVID'S HOUSE. [ METALLIC KNOCKING ] David: JAVIER! [ CONVERSING IN SPANISH ] JEREMY. SHAWN. [ SPEAKING IN SPANISH ] Shawn:  DAVID, WE WERE INVESTIGATING  THE RUINS OF LA PLAZUELA, AND WE CAME ACROSS A VERY  STRANGE STONE CARVING. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? OH. ♪♪ Javier: HE'S GONNA SHOW US SOMETHING. THAT'S THE YEAR THAT  JESUIT'S WERE EXPELLED. SILVER PESOS. IT'S AN INVENTORY. IT'S A BIG INVENTORY. OF WHAT HE HELPED HIDE AND WHERE IT WAS LOCATED. CABALLO CUNCA, RIGHT? IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH  THIS PARALLELS THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT. Shawn: DAVID FERNANDEZ  POSSESSES A LETTER. IT SEEMS TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO  THE FAMOUS SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT, WHICH FIRST SPOKE OF  THE SACAMBAYA TREASURE. SO NOW WE HAVE TWO DOCUMENTS, AND, OF COURSE, THE MARKING  THAT WE JUST FOUND. SEEMED TO POINT  TO CABALLO CUNCA. THE SMALL HILL THAT'S  BEEN THE FOCUS OF SO MANY PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS. THE PROBLEM IS, YOU KNOW I  HAVE RULED OUT CABALLO CUNCA. I MEAN, MY RESEARCH POINTED  US TOWARDS LA PLAZUELA. SO I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO  MAKE OF THIS NEW INFORMATION. YEAH. DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR SHARING THAT WITH US. I HATE TO LEAVE SO EARLY,  BUT WE NEED TO GET BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ♪♪ I WASN'T EXPECTING TO  SEE A DOCUMENT LIKE THAT. BUT I'LL TELL YA THIS,  WE CAN COVER THAT AREA PRETTY QUICK WITH G.P.R. WE DEFINITELY NEED TO GIVE IT  A ONCE-OVER TO CHECK IT OUT. CABALLO CUNCA GOES AGAINST MY  RESEARCH AND JOHNNY'S THEORY. AND YOU KNOW, IN DAVID'S LETTER,  IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER RUSE. BUT TO COME ALL THE WAY  DOWN HERE TO BOLIVIA, AND NOT GO CHECK  OUT CABALLO CUNCA, WOULD BE INCREDIBLY  NEGLIGENT OF ME. THE MONASTERY WILL REMAIN THE  MAIN FOCUS OF THIS EXPEDITION. BUT TO COVER MY BASES,  I'M GONNA ROLL THE DICE. WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN AND  WE'RE GONNA DO A QUICK RECON AT CABALLO CUNCA. BUT UNLIKE PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS, WE'RE GONNA COMB THROUGH  EVERY INCH OF THAT HILL, INCLUDING THE SOUTHERN PORTION. WHICH WAS THE AREA THAT  WAS NEVER SEARCHED. WITH OUR HIGH-TECH GEAR,  GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR AND METAL DETECTORS, WE'LL  BE ABLE TO COVER THAT AREA IN A DAY, MAYBE TWO AT THE MOST. WE'LL JUST DIVIDE AND CONQUER. YOU AND JACK, WORK LA PLAZUELA, JAVIER AND I, WE'RE  GONNA HEAD UP THE HILL. CABALLO CUNCA, HERE WE COME. ♪♪ Narrator: AT SUN UP,  SHAWN AND JAVIER SET OFF FOR THEIR INVESTIGATION  OF CABALLO CUNCA HILL. WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE CONTU RIVER, JEREMY AND JACK DEPLOY A  POWERFUL PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY TO SEARCH FOR ANY  VOIDS OR TUNNELS. NEAR THE WESTERN  SIDE OF THE TEAM'S MAIN HUNTING GROUND  OF LA PLAZUELA. Jeremy: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE OF THESE? IT'S A RESISTIVITY MACHINE. WHAT IT DOES IS, WE'RE GONNA SEND 600 VOLTS TO THE GROUND. ONE PULSE. AND WE CAN SEE IF THERE'S VOIDS. WE CAN SEE IF THERE'S  LARGE METAL CACHES. IT'S ALMOST LIKE HAVING X-RAY VISION. THE RESISTIVITY MACHINE  IS A VOID-DETECTION TOOL. THAT CAN SURVEY 165  FEET BELOW GROUND AND GENERATE A DETAILED 3D  IMAGE OF THE SUBSURFACE. USING ELECTRODE PINS, IT  SHOOTS A 600 VOLT CURRENT INTO THE TURF, WHICH  WILL MEASURE THE FLOW AND INTERRUPTION OF ELECTRICITY  AT DIFFERENT POINTS. AS ELECTRIC CURRENT  CANNOT FLOW THROUGH AIR, IT WILL FACE GREATER  RESISTANCE WHEN IT COMES UP AGAINST A VACUUM. SO A HIGHER THAN NORMAL NUMBER  ON THE RESISTANCE METER COULD INDICATE THE  PRESENCE OF A VOID. ONE THING'S FOR SURE,  THE OTHER EXPEDITION'S NEVER HAD ANYTHING  LIKE THIS. WE COULD START AND  GO ALL THE WAY FROM THE WESTERN EDGE  OF THE MONASTERY STRAIGHT DOWN  A 20 METER PATH. LET'S PUT PINS  DOWN IN INCREMENTS. PUT THE FIRST PIN  LIKE RIGHT HERE. AND THEN PACE OFF  ABOUT EIGHT METERS. ONCE WE'VE COVERED  THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THIS SIDE OF THE MONASTERY, WE CAN MOVE OUTWARDS. THIS IS GONNA BE A HELL OF A LOT FASTER THAN DIGGIN'. OKAY, CLEAR ON THIS END. [ MACHINE BEEPING ] FIRST READING IS 44,260  OHMS OF RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE PINS.  OKAY. IF THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE, WE SHOULD HAVE ABOUT THE SAME READING ALL THE WAY ACROSS. MOVE THE PIN ONE METER AND WE'LL SHOOT IT AGAIN. AS THE RESISTIVITY  DEVICE PROBES THE AREA IN AND AROUND LA PLAZUELA,  SHAWN AND JAVIER MAKE THEIR FINAL APPROACH  TOWARDS CABALLO CUNCA, THE SMALL HILL  THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF ALL PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS. Javier: THE THING ABOUT CABALLO CUNCA IS THAT, PEOPLE SAY THAT IT'S  CURSED, HAUNTED. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DIDN'T WEIGH THE  TREASURE, YOU KNOW? THERE IS THIS HILL  RIGHT BEHIND THIS ONE. IT'S CALLED MAYO MUERTO. AND THEY FOUND HUNDREDS  OF INDIANS BURIED THERE. SOME OF THEM, THEY SAY  EVEN, WERE BURIED ALIVE. ♪♪ ACCORDING TO THE  SAN ROMAN DOCUMENTS, THE CONSTRUCTION OF  THE UNDERGROUND VAULT THAT HID THE GOLD WAS NOT  ONLY A MONUMENTAL TASK, BUT A VERY DEADLY ONE. THE JESUITS HIRED 500  INDIGENOUS LABORERS. 288 DIED FROM YELLOW FEVER. AND ACCORDING TO LEGEND,  THE REST WERE BURIED ALIVE, SO THAT THEY COULD NEVER  REVEAL THE TREASURE'S LOCATION. LOCALS BELIEVE THAT ANYONE  WHO SEARCHES FOR THESE RICHES, WILL FOREVER BE CURSED BY THE  SPIRITS OF THOSE WHO DIED. ♪♪ THERE IT IS! CABALLO CUNCA. THE PLACE THAT LAUNCHED A THOUSAND EXPEDITIONS. LET'S GET UP THERE. ♪♪ Jeremy: UGH, THERE'S A LOT  OF BUGS AROUND HERE. [ COUGHING ]  I JUST SWALLOWED THREE OF 'EM. YOU GOOD?  CLEAR. [ BEEPING ] 47.86, JACK.  SO NOTHIN'. ♪♪ YOU READY, JACK?  CLEAR. ♪♪ HOLY [BLEEP]  WHOA. 237,400. THAT'S A HUGE JUMP. THAT'S A HUGE JUMP. WE HAVE A HOLE. ♪♪ -YOU READY JACK?  -CLEAR. Narrator: JEREMY AND JACK ARE  USING THE RESISTIVITY MACHINE TO DETECT ANY UNDERGROUND VOIDS  OR TUNNELS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF  LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY... -HOLY [BLEEP]  -WHOA! Jeremy: 237,400. ...WHEN THE DEVICE IDENTIFIES A MAJOR ABNORMALITY  IN THE SUBSURFACE. -THAT'S A HUGE JUMP.  -THAT'S A HUGE JUMP! WE HAVE A HOLE. SEE THE SHAFT RIGHT HERE? WATCH I'LL  SPIN IT AROUND. THAT'S A 3D VISUAL  OF THE SUBSURFACE. THAT'S AMAZING. YOU SEE THE DIP?  THAT'S A MAJOR ABERRATION. AND IT'S OUT  ABOUT 16 FEET. LOOK AT HOW STRAIGHT  THAT IS RIGHT? RIGHT ACROSS THERE. WE'VE GOT SOMETHIN' HUGE. THE RESISTIVITY, WE  PICKED UP EITHER A SHAFT OR THERE'S A VOID  RIGHT BELOW US. WHICH MEAN THAT  THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY  TUNNELS THAT THE JESUITS HAVE DUG NEAR LA PLAZUELA. I THINK THE TREASURE GODS ARE  FINALLY SMILIN' DOWN ON US. NOT TO BE TOO OPTIMISTIC,  BUT WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT MAYBE A TUNNEL RIGHT NEXT  TO A JESUIT CHURCH. IT'S VERY PROMISING. YEAH. YOU THINK THAT'S MAN MADE, OR COULD IT BE NATURAL? THERE'S ONLY ONE  WAY TO FIND OUT. LET'S GO LOW TECH AND GET  OUR SHOVELS AND PICKS. I'M READY TO DIG A HOLE. THERE'S A BIG ROCK  RIGHT THERE. THERE'S A MONSTER. [ GRUNTING ] TWO BILLION BUCKS. TWO BILLION. TWO BILLION BUCKS. Narrator: AS THE DIG GETS  UNDER WAY AT LA PLAZUELA, SHAWN AND JAVIER GET  READY TO INVESTIGATE CABALLO CUNCA HILL. KNOWING THAT DAVID FERNANDEZ'S  LETTER AND THE STONE MARKER FOUND NEAR LA PLAZUELA MIGHT BE  POINTING TO CABALLO CUNCA, SHAWN HAS DECIDED TO DO  A PRECAUTIONARY SEARCH OF THE ENTIRE HILL. STARTING WITH ITS  FLAT-TOPPED PEAK AND ENDING WITH  ITS SOUTHERN SLOPES THAT HAD NEVER BEEN  SEARCHED BEFORE. THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE TOP.  LOOK AT THAT VIEW. ♪♪ HERE'S THE PLAN. I WANT TO START  THE SURVEY HERE WITH A G.P.R. I WANT TO WORK ALL  THE WAY BACK DOWN. AND THEN BEHIND ME,  YOU CAN METAL DETECT. SO TO HAVE A LITTLE  MOBILE UNIT LIKE THIS, IS REALLY A BIG ADVANTAGE. Narrator: THE G.P.R.  OR GROUND PENETRATING RADAR, SENDS HIGH FREQUENCY RADIO  WAVES 65 FEET INTO THE GROUND THAT BOUNCE OF SOIL LAYERS  AND ANY OBJECTS BURIED BELOW. THESE PULSES ARE TRANSMITTED  BACK TO A RECEIVER THAT MAPS OUT VARIATIONS  AND ABNORMALITIES. THIS CREATES A VIVID  IMAGE OF THE SUBSURFACE, ENABLING SHAWN AND  JAVIER TO QUICKLY DETECT ANY VOIDS OR BURIED ARTIFACTS  HIDDEN IN CABALLO CUNCA. THIS CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY  WILL BE USED ON THIS HILL FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. HERE'S THE BIG ISSUE,  THESE TWO TECHNOLOGIES, A G.P.R. AND A METAL DETECTOR  AND GONNA SET EACH OTHER OFF. JUST BE COGNIZANT  IN WHERE I AM AND KEEP YOUR DISTANCE  FROM ME. OKAY, PERFECT.  LET'S DO THIS. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] [ THUNDER RUMBLING IN DISTANCE ] [ WIND WHISTLING ] [ RUMBLING CONTINUES ] [ DEVICE BEEPING ] WHOA. OH, YEAH. THERE'S A LITTLE VOID THERE, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING  IN THAT VOID.

Jack: WHAT DO YOU GOT? I MEAN, IT'S GETTIN'  ROCKY AS HELL. THIS IS ALMOST SOLID ROCK BELOW ME. WE GOT TO BE  GETTIN' CLOSE. YEAH, YEAH. Jeremy: THE RESISTIVITY  SAID 16 FEET. I THINK IT'S DEEP. THIS IS GONNA TAKE US  A WHILE. I DON'T KNOW  ABOUT YOU, JACK. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT  OPENING UP A GREAT BIG CAVITY. WELL, WE GOT TO LET IT BREATHE OUT, AND WHEN WE GO IN, WE GOT TO WATCH  FOR TRIP WIRES, PRESSURE PLATES, ANYTHING THAT'S GONNA DROP OR KICK POISON ON US. BUT WE DON'T REALLY  EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS A NATURALLY FORMED  CAVITY, OR A MANMADE ONE. WELL, EITHER WAY,  IF IT'S MANMADE, WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA DEAL WITH POISONOUS GAS. IF IT'S A NATURAL TUNNEL, WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH WHATEVER NATURAL TOXIC AIR THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP. SO TAKE YOUR PICK. ACCORDING TO  THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT, THE JESUITS, I MEAN THEY  BOOBY-TRAPPED EVERYTHING -- THE TUNNELS, THE DOORS,  WITH ENOUGH POISON TO KILL A REGIMENT. CECIL PRODGERS WAS  THE FIRST WESTERNER TO HUNT FOR THE TREASURE  OF SACAMBAYA IN 1910. HE MADE THREE ATTEMPTS AND  NEARLY LOST HIS LIFE DOING SO. HE WAS FOLLOWED BY A SWISS  EXPLORER, EDGAR SANDERS. IN 1928, SANDERS PUT TOGETHER  THE LARGEST MISSION IN TERMS OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT  AND DEMOLITION GEAR. BUT AGAIN, ALL FOR NOTHIN'. AND HIS TEAM SUFFERED  BRUTAL LOSSES. Narrator: MANY WHO HAVE SEARCHED  FOR THE SACAMBAYA TREASURE HAVE MET A GRIM FATE. IN 1910, BRITISH MINING  ENGINEER CECIL PRODGERS, NEARLY DIED AFTER INHALING  POISONOUS GASES WHILE TUNNELING  THROUGH CABALLO CUNCA. TWO DECADES LATER, TWO MEMBERS  OF EDGAR SANDERS' EXPEDITION WENT MISSING, WHILE ANOTHER  FELL INTO A COMA. AND A MEMBER OF JOHNNY IRWIN'S  EXPEDITION LATER LOST HIS LIFE WHEN HE FELL  FROM THE INFAMOUS DEATH ROAD. ♪♪ Jeremy: ONCE WE GET TO  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROCK, WE'RE GONNA BE OPENING UP  A CAN OF WORMS. BUT FIND THE POISON,  FIND THE TREASURE. RIGHT NOW MY BIGGEST FEAR  IS ACTUALLY THIS WHOLE THING CAVING IN AND ME DROPPIN'  INTO A GREAT BIG CAVITY. I'LL CATCH YA. THANKS, JACK. ALL RIGHT. ♪♪ Narrator: A FEW MILES AWAY  ON THE TOP OF CABALLO CUNCA, THE GROUND PENETRATING RADAR  HAS ZEROED IN ON A SMALL VOID A FOOT BELOW THE  SURFACE OF THE HILL. IT'S ABOUT 12 INCHES DOWN.

[GROANING] OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,  LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. STRAIGHT LINES,  IT'S A SQUARE. THAT LOOKS LIKE A CHEST OR A BOX OR SOMETHING. [ GRUNTS ] THERE'S SOMETHING  BURIED THERE.

I MEAN THE JESUITS  ARE FAMOUS FOR BURYING PRECIOUS METALS AND  WOODEN OR METAL CRATES. BUT WE OPEN IT UP,  AND YOU KNOW, BIG SURPRISE. IT'S A PLUNGER. PUT THAT DOWN. THEY USED TO USE THIS IN  THE OLD MINES FOR DYNAMITE. I BET YOU THIS WAS FROM PRODGERS' EXPEDITION, MAYBE EVEN SANDERS'. I MEAN, BOTH PRODGERS AND SANDERS CAME HERE AND USED A LOT OF DYNAMITE. PRODGERS SUPPOSEDLY SAW THIS EGG-SHAPED ROCK ON TOP OF CABALLO CUNCA AND THEN BLEW IT UP. MAYBE THEY USED THIS. THIS IS AT LEAST  100 YEARS OLD, IF IT'S FROM ONE OF  THOSE EXPEDITIONS. IT'S A DYNAMITE PLUNGER. I MEAN, IT DEFINITELY  WASN'T JESUIT OR ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR  WE WERE LOOKING FOR, BUT IT DEFINITELY CONFIRMS  THAT THIS IS WHERE PRODGERS AND OR SANDERS WAS LOOKING. BUT IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING. OBVIOUSLY, MY HOPE IS THAT  WE HAVE MUCH BETTER LUCK THAN ALL THE PREVIOUS EXPLORERS  AND ADVENTURERS. ALRIGHT, LET'S PACK  ALL THIS STUFF UP.

IT SEEMS PRETTY CONTEMPORARY. THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE JESUIT,  BUT IT'S A NICE FIND. Jack: SOMETHING'S SCARING THE DONKEYS. Shawn:  JUST PULL THEM UP. I'LL UNTIE THEM,  YOU JUST GET THEM OUT. [ SNAKE HISSING ]  SNAKE! -SNAKE? SNAKES?  -YEP, SNAKE. MOVE THE GIRLS. MOVE THEM AWAY. I GOT IT, I GOT IT,  I GOT IT, I GOT IT. -WE'RE GOING TO GO.  -GO, GO. JAVI,  KEEP THESE GUYS BACK. DUDE, HE IS MOVING. SOMEBODY COME OVER HERE  AND LIGHT HIM UP. I GOT HIM. I GOT HIM. WHOA, THAT'S A BIG ONE. THAT'S A VIPER, GUYS. Narrator:  THE COCHABAMBA LANCEHEAD. ONE OF THE MOST VENOMOUS  SNAKES IN SOUTH AMERICA. NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS. MAKE SURE THOSE BURROS ARE GOOD. A SINGLE BITE FROM  THIS PIT VIPER CAN LEAD TO SEVERE  BLOOD POISONING THAT CAN PROVE FATAL  IN A MATTER OF HOURS. WHAT'S THE PLAN, JEREMY? JUST KEEP YOUR LIGHT  STRAIGHT ON HIM. SLOW MAN. IT'S GETTING PISSED OFF.  HE'S GETTING PISSED. WATCH OUT. ALRIGHT, BACK OFF A LITTLE. HE'S MOVING AGAIN,  HE'S MOVING AGAIN. WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT,  WATCH OUT! KEEP THOSE BURROS BACK. -WATCH OUT.  -TAKE IT SLOW. ♪♪ I GOT HIM. I'M GOING TO MOVE HIM OUT. ALRIGHT, I'LL KEEP  A LIGHT ON HIM. SLOW AND EASY. GO, GO, GO. [ WATER SPLASHES ] DID YOU GET HIM? DID YOU GET IT? YEAH, HE'S GONE. ♪♪ ♪♪ HOW ARE THESE GUYS, JAVIER?  ARE THEY ALRIGHT? SHAKEN UP A LITTLE BIT. [ SIGHS ] I MEAN, IF THAT THING  WOULD HAVE BIT YOU, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IT. WELL, BOYS, WELCOME TO SACAMBAYA. ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: AFTER A DISTURBED  NIGHT, THE TEAM SPLITS UP, WITH ONE GROUP RESUMING THEIR  DIG TOWARDS THE MYSTERIOUS VOID FOUND NEAR LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY AND THE OTHER CONTINUING  THEIR PRECAUTIONARY SURVEY OF CABALLO CUNCA HILL. -HEY, HEY, JAVI.  -THERE'S A LOT OF RUBBLE. YEAH, I MEAN THIS  LOOKS LIKE BLAST ROCK. THIS IS ALL BUSTED UP. IT'S ALL LITTLE  BITS AND PIECES. DO YOU THINK THE BIG, EGG-SHAPED ROCK WAS HERE? THIS COULD BE IT. I MEAN, PRODGERS BLEW IT  UP WITH TNT, YOU KNOW? THIS COULD BE THE SPOT. Shawn: CECIL PRODGERS  WROTE IN HIS MEMOIR THAT WHEN HE WENT  TO CABALLO CUNCA, HE ACTUALLY FOUND  THE EGG-SHAPED ROCK MENTIONED IN  THE SAN ROMAN DOCUMENT, AND HE DECIDED TO BLOW IT UP TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY  UNDERGROUND PASSAGES BELOW IT. AND SURE ENOUGH, RIGHT THERE,  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, FIRST THING I SEE,  IS THIS HUGE CRATER, AND A BUNCH OF STONE AROUND IT. AS SOON AS I SAW THAT,  I SAID, "I'M HERE." ALRIGHT, LET'S WORK OUR WAY BACK DOWN HERE, TO THE SOUTHERN  PART OF THE HILL. NOBODY'S SEARCHED THAT AREA IN THE PAST. ♪♪ [ SHOVEL SCRAPING ] ♪♪ READY FOR SOME  BIG ROCKS, JACK? YEAH. WHOA. HERE, STANDBY. DON'T THROW IT YET. THAT'S ALRIGHT. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] [ PICK CLINKING ] [ ROCKS CLATTER ] WHOA, WHOA. THAT'S A BIG HOLE. WE'VE GOT OUR CAVE,  JACK. WHOO-HOO! OH, MAN. SEE HOW DEEP IT IS. HOLD ON, LET'S GET  YOU OUT OF THERE, AND LET THAT VENTILATE OUT. ALRIGHT. I GOT AN AIR SNIFFER THAT CAN ANALYZE THAT AIR. WHEN YOU'RE WORKING  UNDERGROUND, IF THERE'S NO PROPER VENTILATION OR NO HOLES IN THE TUNNEL, THE AIR'S COMMONLY TOXIC. THERE'S OFTEN STANDING  WATER OR OLD TIMBERS. THESE WILL PUT OFF  TOXIC GAS OVER TIME. SO I BROUGHT A COUPLE  DEVICES WITH ME THAT ARE HIGH-TECH  AIR SNIFFING DEVICES. WHAT THIS DEVICE DOES IS  IT GIVES YOU A WARNING IF YOU'RE GETTING INTO SOME  SORT OF POISONOUS FUMES. THEY WILL SENSE ABOUT 400  DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOXINS BECAUSE IF YOU GET INTO THAT  TOXIC GAS, IT'LL DROP YOU DEAD. I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING,  BUT LIKE YOU SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO  SMELL ANYTHING. CARBON MONOXIDE  DOESN'T SMELL. ALRIGHT. KEEP FEEDING ME,  KEEP FEEDING ME. GOT IT. THAT THING IS DEEP. I THINK WE'RE HITTING BOTTOM RIGHT THERE, JACK. OKAY. THAT'S PROBABLY  ABOUT 10 FEET. LET'S TAKE A LOOK  AT THE READINGS. 20.2. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THE  AIR'S OKAY FROM HERE. I JUST DON'T TRUST  ELECTRONICS. I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO RISK MY LIFE ON THIS LITTLE APPARATUS. WELL JUST TO BE SURE,  WE'RE GOING TO PACK DOWN THE SELF-RESCUER. THIS DOESN'T GIVE US  ANY NEW OXYGEN, BUT IT ALLOWS US TO  BREATHE FILTERED AIR LONG ENOUGH TO GET OUT. IF YOU CAN GET OUT. I USED TO EXPLORE MINES  WITH MY DAD. THE COAL MINES ARE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS. JUST THE SOUND VIBRATIONS WILL  KNOCK THE ROCKS OFF THE LEAD. AND THE MOMENT YOU LET YOUR  GUARD DOWN, YOU'RE DONE. EXACTLY. SO IF THIS ALARM GOES OFF,  JACK, GET THE HELL OUT? BUG OUT. OKAY, HERE WE GO. WHOA! LET IT DOWN JUST  A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME. OKAY. -YOU GOT ME?  -I GOT YOU. OH [BLEEP] ♪♪ IT'S SOLID.
