 THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN HERE. YOU HEAR THAT? ALMOST SOUNDED METALLIC, JACK. [ DETECTOR BEEPING FASTER ] WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. JACK, THERE IT IS,  RIGHT THERE. WHAT IS THAT? OH, MY GOD.  THIS THING IS HEAVY. HOLY [BLEEP]. OH-HO. -DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?  -YEAH.

 OVER THE LAST THREE CENTURIES,  HUNDREDS OF DIED FOR THIS LEGENDARY TREASURE THAT  COULD BE WORTH OVER $2 BILLION. NOW A BRAVE GROUP  OF TREASURE HUNTERS... -THIS IS THE SPOT.  -...ARMED WITH A NEW LEAD... THE TREASURE IS DOWN  UNDERNEATH THE MONASTERY. ...AND INTEL FROM A CENTURY  OF PAST ATTEMPTS WILL USE CUTTING-EDGE  TECHNOLOGY... ...AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO TAKE  THE VALLEY'S DANGERS HEAD ON. [ BELL TOLLS ]  GET DOWN. AND IF THEY CAN SOLVE  THE MYSTERY OF THE SACAMBAYA, THEY CAN FIND THE TRAIL  TO THE TREASURE. Jack: JEREMY. HOLD TIGHT. THREE, TWO, ONE. INCOMING. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY  DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪♪ Narrator: PREVIOUSLY ON  "TREASURE QUEST"... Jeremy: IT GOES THROUGH  LIKE BUTTER, MAN. -LOOK OUT.  -WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. BOULDERS. AFTER DEPLOYING HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND A BATTERY OF EXPLOSIVES... WE'RE GOING TO BLOW THIS RIDGE. OH, [BLEEP]. ...THE TEAM FINALLY REENTERED  THE ANCIENT TUNNEL NEW LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY. WELCOME TO MY  JESUIT CAVERN, MAN. THEY UNEARTHED THEIR FIRST  PIECE OF JESUIT GOLD... THIS ISN'T JUST A PIECE  OF CLOTH. THIS IS MADE  FROM GOLD BULLION. ...AND, DAYS LATER,  FOUND A RARE ARTIFACT WITH CRYPTIC MARKINGS... THIS IS A BALE SEAL. A BALE SEAL IS, LIKE,  A SHIPPING LABEL. Narrator: ...THAT MIGHT  HELP THEM SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE LEGENDARY  SACAMBAYA TREASURE. IF WE CAN DECIPHER  THESE MARKINGS, WE'LL LEARN A LOT MORE  ABOUT CORD BROUGHT UP  THROUGH THIS TUNNEL. ♪♪ [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] ♪♪ THIS IS A LARGE BALE SEAL. THAT TELLS ME THAT THIS WAS A SEAL ON SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT. Jeremy: YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK AT IT. THIS WAS THE SEAL ON A PIECE OF THE TREASURE. I MEAN, I CAN SEE THIS BEING,  LIKE, ON A BOX OR SOME KIND OF A CASK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT COULD BE ANYWHERE  IN THIS TUNNEL. I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY GET  MORE INFORMATION OUT OF THIS THING, TOO.  -YEAH. IT'S A BIG PART  OF THE PUZZLE. A BALE SEAL TELLS YOU  A LOT OF THINGS. THIS IS SORT OF A PROOF FROM  THE PERSON PACKAGING THIS UP, SAYING, "THIS IS GUARANTEED  TO BE WHAT I SAY IT IS." AND SOMETIMES A BALE SEAL  TELLS YOU, "THIS PIECE IS COMING FROM HERE,  AND IT'S GOING THERE." AND, OF COURSE, FOR US, WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS  THE POINT OF DESTINATION. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND THERE'S ONE THING I DON'T  GET ABOUT THE BALE SEAL. TYPICALLY, THESE SEALS WOULD BE  ATTACHED TO PACKAGES THAT WOULD BE SHIPPED  SOME DISTANCE AWAY, RIGHT? -YEAH.  -YEAH. BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH  OF A DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PLAZUELA MONASTERY  AND THE TUNNEL. RIGHT. SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT THESE  PACKAGES WERE HEADED SOMEWHERE FURTHER AWAY,  SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE TUNNEL? I DON'T KNOW.  I DON'T KNOW. AND THOSE MARKINGS  ARE SO ORNATE. I KNOW WE CAN LEARN  MORE FROM THAT. Jeremy: YEAH.  I THINK IT HAS A LITTLE MORE OF A STORY TO TELL, YOU KNOW?  -OH, YEAH. IF WE CAN DECIPHER  WHAT THESE MARKINGS MEAN, I THINK WE'LL LEARN A LOT MORE  ABOUT WHERE THE TREASURE IS. YEP. WE NEED TO TRACK DOWN SOMEONE  THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO DECIPHER  WHAT THEY MEAN. YOU KNOW WHAT? I ACTUALLY KNOW  SOMEONE IN LA PAZ. HE'S A HISTORIAN  AND AN ARCHAEOLOGIST, A SPECIALIST  IN JESUIT HISTORY. THIS IS PERFECT FOR HIM.  HE WILL KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. -THAT WOULD BE GREAT.  -YEAH. JAVIER, HE HAS AN OLD FRIEND  THAT'S AN ARCHAEOLOGIST WHO HE THINKS  MAY BE ABLE TO HELP, SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SET  UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM, AND HE MAY BE ABLE TO SHED  A LOT OF LIGHT ON THIS. ALL RIGHT.  LET'S GET BACK TO IT. WE NEED TO TRACK DOWN  THE WHOLE ARRAY OF PACKAGES, BUT WE'RE ONLY A TEAM OF FOUR,  SO I WANT TO SPLIT UP. I WANT TO COVER EVERY INCH  OF THIS TUNNEL. ALL RIGHT.  LET'S DO THIS. Narrator:  WHILE SHAWN AND JAVIER COMB  THROUGH THE OFFSHOOTS NEAR THE ENTRANCE  OF THE TUNNEL, JEREMY AND JACK SCOUR  THE MAIN SHAFT IN SEARCH OF MORE VALUABLES  OR CONCEALED PATHWAYS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO  THE TREASURE'S RESTING PLACE. -HEY, JACK.  -YEAH? LOOK.  CHECK THIS OUT. WHAT DO YOU GOT? -GOT OLD TIMBERS, MAN.  -WHAT IS IT? IT COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS, A CHEST, A BOX. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING. ONLY, I'D SAY IT'D BE A PIECE  OF SHORING, BUT THERE'S  NO SHORING IN HERE. IS THAT FORGED NAILS?  -YEAH. YEAH, THEY POUNDED  EACH ONE OUT BY HAND. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 1600,  1700s, AND SO IT CORRELATES  WITH THE TIME FRAME THAT THE JESUITS  WERE HERE. JACK, THIS IS ACTUALLY  SIGNIFICANT. YOU THINK ABOUT IT. IF THEY'RE LEAVING, LIKE, A TRAIL OF CRUMBS  OR LEAVING PIECES, YOU KNOW, WE COULD PROJECT WHERE WE NEED TO GO. -YEAH.  -SO, I MEAN, THIS IS... I WOULD CALL THIS  A HOT AREA. Jeremy:  YOU KNOW, FINDING ONE THING AND THEN ANOTHER THING  AND ANOTHER THING, WE'RE KIND OF FOLLOWING  THESE CLUES. I MEAN, WITH THE CART AND,  YOU KNOW, ALL THE OTHER EVIDENCES  WE'VE FOUND, WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH.  WE'RE ON THE RIGHT ROUTE. ♪♪ KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR THINGS  HIDDEN IN THE WALLS AS WELL. Javier: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THOSE IN SPANISH? THEY ARE CALLED  [SPEAKS SPANISH]. -WHAT'S IT CALLED?  -[ SPEAKS SPANISH ] [ SPEAKS SPANISH ] WITH A T,  LIKE IN TREASURE. THEY'RE ALL AROUND OLD SPANISH COLONIAL HOUSES WHERE THEY BURIED  THE TREASURE IN THE WALLS, AND THEY FIND THEM  ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW, MAYBE THE JESUITS  DID THE SAME. YEAH. I MEAN, THE JESUITS WERE REALLY CLEVER ENGINEERS  AND ARCHITECTS. I MEAN, THEY WERE FAMOUS  FOR HIDING STUFF BEHIND HIDDEN WALLS AND LITTLE NOOKS AND CRANNIES. COME ON, GUYS. WHERE DID YOU STASH THIS? ♪♪ JACK, DO YOU SEE THOSE LITTLE STALACTITES? OH, YEAH.  THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. THERE'S WATER  COMING THROUGH. HMM, DAMN IT. IT'S GOT TO BE RAINING OUTSIDE.  -YEAH. I MEAN, I DON'T WANT  TO BE DOWN HERE WHEN THE RAINY SEASON STARTS, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S POURING OUTSIDE. YEAH. WE'VE GOT NOTHING. LET'S BACKTRACK TO THE MAIN  SHAFT AND SEE WHERE IT GOES. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW YOU. ♪♪ Narrator: OVER THE NEXT 6 HOURS, THE TEAM CONTINUES THEIR SEARCH  DEEPER INTO THE TUNNEL... -ANYTHING?  -NOTHING, MAN. ...BUT ARE UNABLE TO UNCOVER  ANY MORE ARTIFACTS OR CLUES. SHAWN: Hey, Jeremy. SHAWN, COME IN. I really think we should  call it a night, pick it up in the morning. ALL RIGHT. [ BLEEP ] AT THIS POINT, WE'VE COVERED  A PRETTY GOOD CHUNK OF THE TUNNEL HERE  UNDER LA PLAZUELA. WE FOUND THE BALE SEAL,  AND, OF COURSE, YESTERDAY, WE FOUND THE CLOTH OF GOLD,  BUT WE'VE YET TO LAND A MORE SUBSTANTIAL PIECE  OF THE TREASURE, AND, I MEAN,  WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. RAINY SEASON  IS FAST APPROACHING, AND WHEN THAT HITS,  FORGET ABOUT IT. IT'S OVER. THIS VALLEY GETS TOTALLY FLOODED  WITHIN DAYS, SO WE'VE GOT TO START  ZEROING IN ON THE GOLD. ♪♪ ♪♪ THIS PLACE IS HUGE. WE'VE GOT TO FIND  SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WHY I THINK  THE MOTHER LODE IS STILL  SOME DISTANCE AWAY? WHY'S THAT? BECAUSE YOUR SNIFFER  HASN'T GONE OFF. AND THE JESUITS ARE MEANT  TO BOOBY-TRAP THESE FINAL AREAS WITH POISON, POISON THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ENOUGH TO KILL REGIMENTS, SO IF THE ORIGINAL TREASURE DOCUMENT IS ACCURATE, WHEN WE GET THERE, YOUR SNIFFER SHOULD HAVE GONE OFF. YEAH. I'M GUESSING THAT THE GAS  WOULDN'T LAST THAT LONG, SO IT'S PROBABLY A POWDER. I'M BETTING THAT THE POISON  THEY USED, THE POISON THEY LINED IT WITH, ARSENIC BECAUSE ARSENIC IS, I MEAN, ARSENIC  IS A HUGE MINERAL THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO MINE  IN THIS AREA. I MEAN, IT'S A BIG PART OF TIN, AND THAT'S A BIG PART  OF BOLIVIA. AND IT ALSO LASTS HUNDREDS  OF YEARS UNDERGROUND, RIGHT? THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. YEAH, I BET IT'S ARSENIC. IF THE AIR SNIFFER GOES OFF,  YOU BETTER BE READY TO BUG OUT. I'LL GET THE RIGHT FLANK,  AND YOU GET THE LEFT. YEAH, THAT'S FINE. ♪♪ [ GRUNTS ] ♪♪ OH, NO. ♪♪ JEREMY. COMING, JACK.  COMING. HEY, OVER HERE. WHAT DO YOU GOT? LOOK. MAN. END OF THE LINE. ♪♪ HEY, JACK. LOOK. THEY'RE LEAVING, LIKE,  A TRAIL OF CRUMBS. Narrator:  AFTER A WEEK-LONG SEARCH  OF THE JESUIT TUNNEL NEAR LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY, THE EXPEDITION IS BROUGHT  TO A GRINDING HALT. OH, NO.  LOOK. WHAT THE HELL, MAN? END OF THE LINE. THIS IS THE END  OF THE TUNNEL. HOW COULD THIS BE? ♪♪ WE KNOW FOR A FACT,  WITH THE CART, CLOTH AND THE BALE SEAL, THAT THEY CAME THROUGH  THE TUNNEL. YEAH. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY  COULDN'T PASS THIS POINT, AND THEY STOPPED. THIS DOESN'T MAKE  ANY SENSE TO ME. I DON'T KNOW. SHAWN, JAVI, COME IN. SHAWN: What's up, man? I NEED YOU TO COME OVER TO WHERE JACK AND I ARE AT RIGHT NOW. WE'RE ABOUT 100 YARDS DOWN. -All right.  -THESE WALLS ARE SOLID. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER DRIFT  OR ANY OTHER WAY THROUGH HERE. NO.  WITH THE JESUITS, THE OBVIOUS IS NOT ALWAYS THE ANSWER. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE  AN OPENING DOESN'T MEAN  THERE ISN'T ONE. LOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE COVERING UP ANOTHER ENTRANCE. ALL RIGHT.  HEY, GUYS. HEY.  HOW'S IT GOING? NOT GOOD.  HAVE A LOOK. -IS THIS THE END?  -IT'S THE END. YOU GOT TO BE  FRICKING KIDDING ME. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE DIGGING A TUNNEL AND JUST STOPPED, I MEAN, JUST DROPPED EVERYTHING, STOP AND WALKED. THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON,  EXPLANATION. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR CLUES, FALSE WALLS OR ANY HIDDEN CHAMBERS. THAT LOOKS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR IT. IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S HOLLOW  ON THE OTHER SIDE. THAT'S PRETTY SOLID. THIS LOOKS RIGHT. AND LISTEN TO IT. MM. MAYBE NOT. Shawn:  THIS ISN'T A CAVE-IN LIKE WHEN  WE FIRST ENTERED THE TUNNEL. I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  ALL SOLID ROCK. THERE'S NO BREAKS,  NO OPENINGS. THERE'S NO OFFSHOOTS. [ BLEEP ] ♪♪ -[ GRUNTS ]  -WHAT'S THAT? LOOK AT THESE BROKEN  HAMMER AND CHISELS. THEY LEFT A LOT  OF BROKEN TOOLS HERE. I THINK THE ROCK WAS TOO HARD  TO GET THROUGH WITH THEIR PRIMITIVE TOOLS. ♪♪ A LOT OF WORK WENT INTO  DIGGING THESE TUNNELS TO HIDE THE TREASURE HERE. MAYBE THESE TUNNELS WERE  BEING DUG AS A PASSAGEWAY TO BRING IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. WHAT IF THEY WERE TRYING, AND THEY JUST COULDN'T  GET ANY FURTHER, AND THEY HAD NO OTHER CHOICE  BUT TO ABORT? BUT IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HIDE IT IN A TUNNEL, THEN WHERE? WHERE WERE THEY  TRYING TO GET? I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S THE QUESTION. HAVING FOUND CLEAR PROOF THAT  THE TREASURE CAME THROUGH HERE, THERE SHOULD BE A STASH  OF THE TREASURE RIGHT HERE, BUT WE'VE EXPLORED EVERY INCH OF IT THAT I KNOW OF, AND WE HAVEN'T FOUND IT. YOU KNOW, PUTTING TOGETHER  ALL THE OTHER CLUES WE'VE FOUND HERE, MAYBE THE JESUITS WEREN'T HIDING  THE TREASURE HERE AS MUCH AS THEY WERE  USING THE TUNNEL TO COVERTLY TRANSPORT IT  TO SOME OTHER DESTINATION. BUT GOING BY THESE BROKEN TOOLS,  IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO TUNNEL  THROUGH TO THEIR FINAL ENDPOINT BUT COULDN'T PENETRATE THE ROCK. THEY WERE FORCED ABOVEGROUND  TO TAKE AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE. I MEAN, THAT'S THE THING ABOUT TREASURE HUNTING. I MEAN, IT'S -- YOU GOT TO STEP BACK SOMETIMES AND REANALYZE A LITTLE BIT. KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW, I THINK THE PRESENCE  OF A BALE SEAL BECOMES ALL THE MORE RELEVANT. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE  MARKINGS ON THIS BALE SEAL BECAUSE THEY MIGHT EVEN LEAD US  TO THE FINAL DESTINATION. BUT FIRST WE NEED TO CALCULATE  WHERE THIS TUNNEL WAS HEADED. IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE  PROJECTED PATH OF THE TUNNEL, THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE  TO NARROW DOWN THE  JESUIT'S FINAL DESTINATION. LET'S GO TOPSIDE. AND JACK'S THE MAN FOR THAT. AS A FIELD DEMOLITIONS EXPERT, HE STUDIED TOPOGRAPHY  AND 3-D IMAGERY, SO I HAVE ALL THE FAITH  IN THE WORLD THAT HE'LL BE ABLE TO  FIGURE OUT THE DIRECTION THAT THIS TUNNEL IS LEADING. ♪♪ Jack:  I'M GOING TO SET UP MY OFFICE  OVER HERE, GUYS. I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN GPS  NAVIGATION AND MAPS, AND BY USING SATELLITE IMAGERY,  I BUILT A 3-D MAP OF THE AREA. FROM THAT, WE WERE ABLE TO ADD  ADDITIONAL FEATURES LIKE OUR UNDERGROUND TUNNEL  AND WHICH WAY IT WAS GOING. USING OUR HIGH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THE GROUND-PENETRATING  RADAR AND THE RESISTIVITY, WHICH ESSENTIALLY NOT ONLY  ALLOWS US TO LOOK UNDERGROUND, BUT TO GET A 3-D IMAGE  OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING. SO I GAVE US A PARAMETER  WITH 2 MILES' DISTANCE. LA PLAZUELA IS GROUND ZERO,  RIGHT IN THE CENTER, RIGHT? UH-HUH. TUNNEL RUNS OFF THIS WAY,  NORTHEAST TRAJECTORY. Shawn: THE TUNNEL'S PROJECTED PATH LIES NORTHEAST OF PLAZUELA. I MEAN, IT'S CERTAINLY  HEADED NORTHEAST. YOU'VE GOT A FEW DISTINCT LANDMARKS STRAIGHT AHEAD, THAT TALL PLATEAU. THERE'S ALSO THE ARROYO THAT CUTS THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE, A CAVERN OR A CAVE.  -UH-HUH. AND THAT'S ALL WITHIN A 2 OR 3-MILES RADIUS. BEYOND THAT, WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE? HUH. Shawn: LOOKING AT JACK'S 3-D  MAP, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE JESUITS  WERE TRYING TO MOVE IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. THERE'S A FEW PROMISING  LANDMARKS IN THAT DIRECTION. GET A SATELLITE LINK UP.  -ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO GIVE JOHN IRWIN  A CALL. I WANT TO REACH OUT  TO JOHNNY IRWIN AND SEE IF HE HAS SOME INSIGHT INTO WHERE THE JESUITS  MIGHT BE HEADED. YOU CAN TALK TO ANYBODY IN THE WORLD WITH ONE OF THESE. YEAH. Narrator:  THE TEAM DECIDES TO SEEK  THE ADVICE OF JOHNNY IRWIN, THE LAST SURVIVING MEMBER  OF THE 1990 EXPEDITION. HAVING SEARCHED MUCH OF THE AREA AROUND LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY  DURING HIS MISSION, JOHNNY IRWIN HAS  EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY. -JOHNNY.  -HELLO. HEY, BUDDY.  HOW YOU DOING? I'M DOING FINE.  OH, YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT. LOOK, THERE'S BOLIVIA  IN BACK OF YOU. YEAH.  IT'S BEAUTIFUL. JOHNNY, I'VE GOT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO JEREMY. IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU.  I'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU. [ LAUGHS ]  YOU TOO, MAN. WE'VE BEEN HAVING A HELL  OF AN ADVENTURE. WELL, TELL ME ABOUT IT. IT'S GOT REAL  GOLD THREAD IN IT. OH, MAN. Narrator: AFTER UPDATING JOHNNY  ON THE VARIOUS DISCOVERIES MADE DURING THE COURSE  OF THE EXPEDITION... TO FIND THAT HERE IN BOLIVIA IN THIS SPOT IS PRETTY PROFOUND. Narrator: ...SHAWN REVEALS  THE MAJOR OBSTACLE CURRENTLY BLOCKING  THEIR PROGRESS. SO, JOHNNY, THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY WERE USING THIS TUNNEL, AND, UNFORTUNATELY, WE RUN INTO A DEAD END. LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST STOPPED ALL OF A SUDDEN. IT'S A WALL. HAVE YOU DISTURBED THE BACK  OF THE CAVE VERY MUCH? IT'S ROCK. I MEAN, IT'S A DEAD END INTO SOLID ROCK. JOHNNY, WE KNOW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO EXTEND THIS TUNNEL IN A NORTHEASTERLY  DIRECTION, AND MAYBE IF THEY COULDN'T GET THROUGH THE ROCK, THEY CAME BACK OUT TOPSIDE AND THEN WENT TO THAT DESTINATION. CAN YOU THINK OF WHERE THE FINAL DESTINATION WAS? OH, MY GOODNESS. MY ADRENALINE  IS GOING LIKE CRAZY NOW TRYING TO THINK  WHERE THEY MOVED THIS TO. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE  TO FIGURE OUT. ANY ADVICE? I'M NOT REALLY SURE, BUT I'VE GOT  A REALLY PLAUSIBLE OPTION. -IS THIS THE END?  -IT'S THE END. Jack: YOU GOT TO BE  FRICKING KIDDING ME. Narrator: THE TEAM'S SEARCH OF  THE ANCIENT JESUIT TUNNEL HAS COME TO A DEAD END, SO THEY FIGURE OUT  AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO GET BACK  ON THE TREASURE'S TRAIL. SO I GAVE US A PARAMETER  WITH 2 MILES' DISTANCE. Narrator:  USING 3-D MAPPING TECHNOLOGY, THEY VISUALIZED THE PROJECTED  PATH OF THE TUNNEL. THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT  THE TREASURE WAS MOVED TO A LOCATION NORTHEAST  OF LA PLAZUELA, SO THEY SEEK THE ADVICE  OF VETERAN TREASURE HUNTER JOHNNY IRWIN... -JOHNNY.  -HELLO. ...TO FIGURE OUT  THIS NORTHEASTERLY HIDEOUT OF THE JESUIT FORTUNE. SO, JOHNNY, WE KNOW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO EXTEND THIS TUNNEL IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. CAN YOU THINK OF WHERE THE FINAL DESTINATION WAS? I'VE GOT A REALLY  PLAUSIBLE OPTION. I'M THINKING OF AN ARROYO  WHERE I FOUND IRON CHAIN. I REMEMBER TOUCHING BASE  ABOUT THIS ARROYO. I FOUND THESE CHAINS ALONG  WITH OXEN SHOES AND A LOT OF BRONZE PLATES UPRIVER FROM PLAZUELA IN AN ARROYO  THAT GOES UP THE HILL. WOW. THESE ARE PRETTY HEAVY-DUTY. I WOULD ASSUME THIS IS  FOR TRANSPORTING OR MOVING SOMETHING QUITE LARGE AND HEAVY. THIS WAS A SPOT.  IT DIDN'T FIT. NOTHING EVER REALLY  GREW IN IT. AND THAT, I FELT, WAS THE MOST  INTRIGUING LOCATION. IT LOOKS LIKE A HIDING PLACE, AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK  YOU OUGHT TO GO. Shawn:  WE USED A 3-D MAP WITH A 2-MILE RADIUS AROUND PLAZUELA,  AND GUESS WHAT? WHAT DID YOU FIND? ONE OF THE LANDMARKS NORTHEAST OF THE MONASTERY WAS AN ARROYO. -OH, WOW.  -THAT MUST BE IT. Jeremy: LIKE A DEEP-SIDED GULLY,  STEEP SLOPES ON EITHER SIDE. YES. HOW FAR WERE YOU AWAY  FROM LA PLAZUELA? HOW LONG WAS THE WALK OR ANY OTHER DETAIL YOU CAN GIVE? MAYBE ANYWHERE BETWEEN  HALF A MILE AND 2 MILES. IT'S BEEN SO LONG. WE'VE GOT SATELLITE PICTURES  OF THE WHOLE AREA AND ALL THE ARROYOS,  SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO... BEAUTIFUL.  OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. THIS IS A NEW LEAD. I'M FEELING MORE ENERGIZED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR ADVICE. WE'LL KEEP YOU  IN THE LOOP. GREAT. GREAT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, JOHNNY.  GREAT TO SEE YOU. WE'LL TALK SOON.  -OKAY. Shawn: SO THIS ARROYO THAT  JOHNNY IS TALKING ABOUT IS REALLY INTRIGUING. IT'S ABOUT A MILE, MAYBE A MILE  AND A HALF FROM PLAZUELA. JOHNNY SAID IT'S CLEARLY  CUT BY RUNNING WATER. I MEAN, IT'S GOT VERY STEEP  SIDES, MUDDY BANK. YOU KNOW, AND UNLIKE  MOST OF THE VALLEY, IT SEEMS TO HAVE VERY LITTLE VEGETATION GROWING ON IT. WE HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT. WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF WE  CAN ACTUALLY TRIANGULATE THE LOCATION  USING GPS COORDINATES. AND HERE'S THE DEAL. TOMORROW MORNING. YOU GUYS MAKE YOUR WAY  TO THE ARROYO, SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND THERE.  -OKAY. JAVI AND I ARE GOING  TO HEAD TO LA PAZ AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THIS BALE SEAL EXAMINED. Shawn: WE'VE NOW GOT TWO  VERY CLEAR GOALS. THAT WILL HOPEFULLY PUT US  BACK ON THE TRAIL. FIRST, WE NEED TO TRACK DOWN  THIS ARROYO, AND OF COURSE, SECOND, WE NEED TO GET  THESE BALE SEAL MARKINGS CHECKED OUT BY AN EXPERT. THAT MIGHT GIVE US SOME CLARITY ABOUT THE TREASURE'S  WHEREABOUTS. NICE JOB, JACK.  LET'S HIT THE HAY. EARLY MORNING TOMORROW. ♪♪ ♪♪ ALL RIGHT.  LET'S GO. Narrator: AT FIRST LIGHT,  SHAWN AND JAVIER HIT THE ROAD TO MEET UP WITH AN ARCHAEOLOGIST WHO MIGHT HELP DECIPHER  THE MARKINGS ON THE BALE SEAL WHILE JEREMY AND JACK  SET OFF ON A 2-MILE HIKE TO TRACK DOWN  JOHNNY IRWIN'S ARROYO. -HOW ARE WE DOING?  -GOOD. WE'RE ON TRACK. Jeremy:  THE ONLY PROBLEM I'VE GOT  IS THAT WAS 27 YEARS AGO. I MEAN,  THIS RIVER IS CUT. I MEAN, YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH  CUT THIS BACK, YOU KNOW? Jack: IT'S GOING TO LOOK DIFFERENT FROM HIS EXPEDITION, BUT AT LEAST WE'LL BE  AT THE RIGHT PLACE. HERE'S A SWAMP  TO GET THROUGH. FUN. ♪♪ HOW FAR ARE WE, JACK? 200 METERS AWAY. IF THE COORDINATES ARE RIGHT,  GOT TO GO UP HERE AND AROUND  THE CORNER TO THE LEFT. LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PLACE  FOR SNAKES. IT IS,  GREAT PLACE FOR SNAKES. YEP. SHOULD BE RIGHT THROUGH HERE, LESS THAN 100 METERS. OKAY. WHEW.  BOY, IT GETS TIGHT UP HERE. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN  FOR ANY SIGNS, JACK. IT'S GOING TO BE SUBTLE. -CAN WE GET THROUGH HERE?  -YEAH. SEE IF I CAN  SQUEEZE THROUGH? THIS TERRAIN IS BRUTAL. I CAN SEE WHY OTHER EXPEDITIONS  HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS. YEAH, IT'S UNFORGIVING. I'VE PULLED OUT MORE THORNS THAN I CAN EVEN COUNT AT THIS POINT. ♪♪ WE'RE REALLY CLOSE. LET'S GET UP HERE IN THE OPENING  AND HAVE A LOOK, RIGHT THROUGH THIS RIVERBED. ♪♪ THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE VALLEY. IT'S JUST AS JOHNNY  DESCRIBED IT. THIS IS THE ARROYO. YEAH. THIS IS THE PLACE. NEW GROUND ZERO. ♪♪ Narrator: AFTER MAPPING OUT  POTENTIAL SEARCH AREAS NEAR LA PLAZUELA MONASTERY  AND SECURING A TIP FROM A MEMBER OF THE  LAST MAJOR EXPEDITION... I'M THINKING OF AN ARROYO  WHERE I FOUND IRON CHAIN. Narrator:  ...THE TEAM REALIGNS THEIR HUNT  1 1/2 MILES NORTHEAST, FROM A TUNNEL NEAR THE MONASTERY  TO AN ARROYO WHERE JESUIT ARTIFACTS  WERE FOUND 3 DECADES AGO. Jeremy: THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE VALLEY. THIS IS THE ARROYO. YEAH. NEW GROUND ZERO. IT'S JUST AS JOHNNY IRWIN  DESCRIBED IT. YEAH. NO UNDERBRUSH,  ABOVE THE RIVERBED, AND IT'S THE ONLY ARROYO  AROUND LA PLAZUELA. -YEAH.  -AND IT MAKES SENSE. I MEAN, THE JESUITS HAD THE SPANISH COMING DOWN ON THEM, SO THESE GUYS  WERE IN A HURRY. YEAH. LET'S SEE WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE  WE CAN FIND. I MEAN,  A LOT OF EROSION HERE. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE  WHAT'S WASHED THROUGH HERE. -IN LIKE 250 YEARS.  -YEAH. I MEAN, THERE COULD VERY WELL BE MORE THINGS BURIED OR EVEN A TUNNEL. -YEAH.  -WE DON'T KNOW. I BROUGHT A LITTLE TOOL WITH ME TO MAKE IT FAST AND EASY, A MAGNETOMETER. THAT IS GREAT. SO THIS THING WILL DETECT THE SMALLEST DISTURBANCES IN THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD  CREATED BY METALS. SO WE'LL BE ABLE  TO PICK UP THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY SMALL AND PRETTY DEEP. THE TEAM WILL CONDUCT  AN INITIAL SEARCH OF THE ARROYO WITH A PORTABLE MAGNETOMETER. THE SENSOR ON THE DEVICE  MEASURES ANY ABNORMALITIES IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD  UNDERGROUND WHICH MIGHT BE CAUSED BY  THE PRESENCE OF METALLIC OBJECT IN THE SUBSURFACE. UNLIKE SOME METAL DETECTORS,  THE MAGNETOMETER IS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC METAL  BURIED BELOW, BUT IT CAN DETECT ANOMALIES  AT A DEPTH OF OVER 30 FEET WHILE MOST TOP-OF-THE-LINE  METAL DETECTORS ARE LIMITED  TO LESS THAN 2 FEET. ♪♪ TRICK IS TO KEEP IT VERTICAL AND TO KEEP IT STABLE. ♪♪ IT'S KIND OF LIKE  THE X-RAY GLASSES THAT NOBODY  EVER HAD BEFORE, THE ONES I USED TO BUY OUT OF THE BACK OF COMIC BOOKS. YEAH.  I KNOW WHY YOU BOUGHT THOSE. [ LAUGHS ] ON THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE BOLIVIAN ANDES, SHAWN AND JAVIER ARE STILL  5 HOURS FROM LA PAZ, WHERE THEY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT  WITH AN ARCHAEOLOGIST TO EXAMINE THE BALE SEAL. Shawn: JAVI, WE'RE LATE. I HOPE WE MAKE IT. I JUST HOPE THAT GONZALO  IS WAITING FOR US. I CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS  THIS APPOINTMENT. I HATE DRIVING THESE ROADS.  WE'RE ALMOST THERE. I'D PREFER TO BE ON  THOSE BURROS RIGHT THERE. -UH-OH.  -WHAT'S THIS? Driver: I DON'T KNOW.  MAYBE ACCIDENT. I'LL GO CHECK IT OUT. YOU GUYS JUST STAY BACK HERE. I DON'T WANT THE CAMERAS TO GET US MORE ATTENTION RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT. [ SIGHS ] I SEE SMOKE. SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A RUCKUS  GOING ON DOWN THERE, TOO. DOES THIS HAPPEN  A LOT HERE? PROBLEMS WITH THE CORRUPTION. SO THE LOCAL PEOPLE  WILL JUST BLOCKADE THE ROAD? THAT'S THE WAY, TO STOP THE CORRUPTION. THE MAKE  THEIR VOICES HEARD. MM-HMM. THIS COULD BE A LONG TIME. COULD BE. WE'RE SCREWED.  IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. -WHAT'S THE DEAL?  -IT'S A BLOCKADE. [ SPEAKS SPANISH ] FARMERS,  THEY WANT TO PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT  TAKING THEIR LANDS. THIS COULD GO ON  FOR DAYS. WE CAN'T -- THEY WON'T LET US PASS? -NO.  -I MEAN, IT'LL TAKE US ALL DAY, AT LEAST, TO GET BACK TO COME BACK AROUND. THAT'S NOT -- I CAN'T DO THAT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? THERE'S A WAY  RIGHT OVER THIS HILL. WE GOT TO HIKE. WE GOT A LONG HIKE  THAT WAY. WE CROSS, TAKE A TAXI,  GO TO LA PAZ. IT'S A LITTLE SKETCHY,  BUT IF WE DO THIS, WE CAN GET THERE  BY TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT. VERDO, WE GOT TO GO, MAN. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT. ALL RIGHT. THANKS FOR GETTING US  THIS FAR, MAN. TAKE CARE. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.  WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN. -ARE YOU AFRAID OF HEIGHTS?  -WHY? BECAUSE SOMETIMES  THE EASIEST WAY IS JUST TO FLY  ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN. Shawn: WHAT? ♪♪ SHAWN, LOOK. Shawn: THIS IS HOW  WE'RE GETTING DOWN? UNLESS YOU WANT TO HIKE DOWN,  HIKE BACK UP. WELL, I MEAN, IS THIS A TYPICAL  WAY TO TRAVEL IN BOLIVIA? YEAH, MAN. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WE HAVE TO DO THIS, MAN.  TIME IS PRECIOUS. YOU WANT TO GO FIRST? ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. Javier: NORMALLY, ZIP-LINING  IS A FORM OF TOURISM. BUT SPECIFICALLY IN THIS AREA, IN THE YUNGAS, YOU KNOW,  DUE TO THE HIGH MOUNTAINS, IT'S THE QUICKEST WAY  OF TRANSPORTATION FROM ONE MOUNTAIN  TO THE OTHER, AND HOPEFULLY IT'S GOING  TO SAVE US A LOT OF TIME. THANK YOU, PLEASE. Shawn: ALL RIGHT, JAVI.  I'M TRUSTING YOU ON THIS ONE. SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. YO. WOO-HOO! ♪♪ WOO! YEAH! ♪♪ AH!  -[ LAUGHS ] HEY. YOU MADE IT.  THAT WAS AWESOME. I KIND OF LIKE THIS WAY  OF GETTING AROUND. I THINK WE JUST MADE UP  ALL THE TIME WE LOST. THANKS, AMIGO. YOU THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET A CAR DOWN HERE? I'M SURE AT LEAST RENT A CAR,  MAYBE A PICKUP. ♪♪ Narrator: BACK IN THE SACAMBAYA  VALLEY, JEREMY AND JACK HAVE BEEN  DEPLOYING A MAGNETOMETER FOR THE PAST 3 HOURS TO  SEARCH THE BASE OF THE ARROYO. Jeremy: SO, JACK, WHEN DID YOU FIGURE OUT YOU WANTED TO BE AN EXPLOSIVES EXPERT? Jack:  OH, I'VE BEEN DOING CLASSES AND  BLASTING FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, AND IT'S WORKED OUT  PRETTY WELL. WHAT'S THE LIFETIME EXPECTANCY OF SOMEBODY IN DEMOLITION? -I'LL LET YOU KNOW.  -[ LAUGHS ] RIGHT ON. [ METAL DETECTOR BEEPING ] I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.  COME HERE. -WHAT YOU GOT?  -LOOK. WHEN I RUN OVER IT, IT DISTURBS THE MAGNETIC FIELD, SO THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN HERE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO  IS SET OUT A HALF-METER GRID. HAVING DETECTED AN ANOMALY  BELOW THE GROUND, JEREMY AND JACK  LAY DOWN PLASTIC MARKERS TO CREATE A RECTANGULAR GRID  OF THE RELEVANT AREA. THEY COLLECT DATA  AT EACH GRID POINT, AND THIS INFORMATION IS ANALYZED  BY THE DEVICE'S RECEIVER, WHICH USES IT TO GENERATE  A 2-D REPRESENTATION OF THE GRIDDED SUBSURFACE. ALL RIGHT.  WELL, LET'S RENDER IT, AND LET'S GET AN IDEA  OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ♪♪ Jack: WHOA. SO THE RED BLOTCH IS OUR TARGET? YEAH, YOU GOT IT.  THAT IS A MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE. CAN YOU TELL  HOW BIG IT IS? -IT'S LESS THAN HALF A METER.  -OKAY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCALE,  IT IS RIGHT ABOUT THERE. SO GRAB A SHOVEL.  LET'S START DIGGING. ♪♪ DON'T BLOW YOUR BACK OUT,  JACK. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] SERIOUSLY, DON'T GIVE YOURSELF  A HEART ATTACK, MAN. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE  TO PACK YOU OUT OF HERE. I'LL HAVE TO QUARTER YOU. ♪♪ [ ITEM TINGS ] DID YOU HEAR THAT? -WHAT DO YOU GOT?  -I DON'T KNOW. IT ALMOST SOUNDED... I HEAR SOMETHING METALLIC,  JACK. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. LET'S GO SLOW. IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING GOOD.  YOU NEVER KNOW. [ DEVICE BEEPS ] HERE. HOLD ON.  LET ME DO IT BY HAND. ALL RIGHT. [ DEVICE BEEPING ] NOW IT'S BEEPING. [ BEEPING FASTER ] RIGHT THERE. -SOUNDS LIKE IT.  -RIGHT THERE. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. JACK, THERE IT IS,  RIGHT THERE. WHAT IS THAT? OH, MY GOD.  THIS THING IS HEAVY. HOLY [BLEEP]. OH-HO! WOW. OXEN LINKS. THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME CHAIN  THAT JOHNNY FOUND, I MEAN, THE EXACT  SAME TYPE OF LINKAGE. THEY'RE MOVING SOMETHING HEAVY TO USE LINKAGE LIKE THAT. THE TUNNEL SHOULD BE RIGHT UP HERE SOMEWHERE, RIGHT? MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE WHILE. I MEAN, THIS GPR IS PERFECT  FOR TRACKING THE TUNNEL. THE GPR  OR GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST  VERSATILE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT WE HAVE HERE ON THE EXPEDITION. BY SHOOTING RADIO FREQUENCY  WAVES IN THE GROUND, USUALLY ABOUT 65 FEET DEEP, THIS THING CAN DETECT NOT ONLY  THE PRESENCE OF ARTIFACTS BELOW BUT ALSO PICK UP  ON ANY UNDERGROUND VOIDS. WE SHOULD BE GETTING  REALLY CLOSE. IT'LL GIVE THESE READINGS  IN REAL TIME, SO NO WAITING AROUND, YOU KNOW,  TO HAVE YOUR HUNCH VERIFIED. AND UNLIKE THE GPRS OF THE PAST  THAT WERE THE SIZE AND THE WEIGHT OF A LAWNMOWER, THESE NEW MODELS  ARE SUPER PORTABLE AND EXCEL  IN THIS RUGGED TERRAIN, AND THAT'S EXACTLY  WHAT WE'VE GOT AROUND US. SO HERE IN THE SACAMBAYA VALLEY,  THE GPR IS THE IDEAL TOOL. THIS IS IT.  THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE. STANDING RIGHT ABOVE A VOID. THAT'S THE BEGINNING  OF THE TUNNEL. [ DEVICE BEEPING ] Jeremy: JACK,  THERE IT IS, RIGHT THERE. Jack: WHAT IS THAT? OH, MY GOD.  THIS THING IS HEAVY. HOLY [BLEEP]. OH-HO. OXEN LINKS. THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME CHAIN  THAT JOHNNY FOUND, I MEAN,  THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF LINKAGE. JOHNNY TURNED US ONTO  THE ARROYO, AND HE WAS RIGHT. I MEAN, THIS IS THE ARROYO  WHERE HE FOUND HIS CHAIN, AND NOW WE'VE FOUND  ONE SET OF CHAIN HERE. THESE ARE OXEN CHAINS. SO IF THEY WERE USING OXEN  AND THEY WERE BREAKING CHAINS OR LOSING CHAINS, WE KNOW THEY WERE  CARRYING SOMETHING HEAVY. FEEL IT, MAN. THAT'S HEAVY.  -OH, THEY'RE REALLY HEAVY. THEY'RE MOVING SOMETHING HEAVY TO USE LINKAGE LIKE THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS,  IT'S BLACK IRON. LOOK AT ALL THE IRON OXIDE.  SEE THE RED COMING OUT? IF YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU CAN SEE  THEY WERE ALL HANDMADE. YOU CAN SEE A FLAT SPOT.  THAT'S FROM AN ANVIL. THERE'S DIFFERENT THICKNESSES  GOING AROUND THE LINK. THESE ARE DEFINITELY 1700s. THEY COULD EVEN BE EARLIER  THAN THAT. ANOTHER THING ABOUT IRON IS IT  DIDN'T COME TO THE AMERICAS UNTIL THE EUROPEANS ARRIVED.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE CLOSEST EUROPEAN STRUCTURE  AROUND HERE IS LA PLAZUELA. YEAH. THE JESUITS, YOU KNOW, THEY HAD  THIS WHOLE PLACE MAPPED OUT. THEY KNEW IT LIKE THE BACK  OF THEIR HAND, SO THEY USED THIS ARROYO, AND THEY SKEDADDLED OUT OF HERE,  AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS WAS A WAYPOINT  OR THE FINAL DESTINATION. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING  FOR MILES AROUND. GOD, I WISH JOHNNY IRWIN  WERE HERE TO SEE THIS. THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE. FROM HERE TO THERE,  WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH. YEAH. LET'S GO FIND WHAT THEY WERE  [BLEEP] HAULING UP THERE. X MARKS THE SPOT. ♪♪ Narrator: AFTER A 200-MILE  DRIVE, A LONG HIKE AND AN UNEXPECTED ZIP LINE  ACROSS THE BOLIVIAN ANDES, SHAWN AND JAVIER FINALLY REACH  THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST CITY TO GET THE BALE SEAL  EXAMINED BY AN ARCHAEOLOGIST. IT'S PRETTY WILD TO BE IN CIVILIZATION, I TELL YOU. Javier:  DO YOU FEEL THE ALTITUDE? YEAH, I CAN FEEL IT. LA PAZ IS THE HIGHEST  CAPITAL CITY IN THE WORLD. CRAZY UPHILL, RIGHT? -IT'S A PRETTY SEVERE LANDSCAPE.  -YEAH. NOT AN EASY PLACE TO BUILD  A CAPITAL CITY ON. ♪♪ YOU SEE THE CATHEDRAL  OF SAN FRANCISCO? IT'S JUST AN AMAZING CATHEDRAL,  LIKE, A HUGE CONSTRUCTION. RIGHT. AND, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT  THERE ARE TUNNELS UNDERNEATH, JUST THE WAY JESUITS  USED TO DO THINGS. YEAH, THE WHOLE CATACOMBS  AND ALL OF THAT. EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING WHEN WE SEE THE RUINS LIKE LA PLAZUELA  AND LA PARIA, AND YOU THINK, YOU KNOW,  BACK 300, 400 YEARS AGO, WHAT THIS WHOLE PLACE  WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. IT WAS JUST A MAJOR PART. THE SPANISH COLONIAL EMPIRE  HAD A REAL HOLD ON THIS PART  OF THE WORLD -- LIMA, CARTAGENA,  POTOSI, LA PAZ. YEAH, AND, STRATEGICALLY,  IT'S, LIKE, BOLIVIA IS RIGHT IN THE HEART  OF SOUTH AMERICA. RIGHT. THIS IS WHERE THEY WOULD MEET,  YOU KNOW, ALL THE GOLD  AND GO OFF TO... MASSIVE AMOUNT OF SILVER  AND GOLD CAME OUT OF THIS PART  OF THE WORLD. ♪♪ IS THIS IT?  -YEAH. THIS IS THE HOUSE. OH, I'M REALLY ANXIOUS  TO MEET HIM. Javier: GONZALO  IS AN ARCHAEOLOGIST. HE WAS MY PROFESSOR  IN UNIVERSITY, AND HE REALLY IS THE GUY THAT KNOWS EVERYTHING  ABOUT THE JESUIT ERA, THE HISTORY OF PRE-COLONIAL  AND COLONIAL ERA HERE IN BOLIVIA  AND SOUTH AMERICA. I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HE HAS  TO SAY ABOUT THE BALE SEAL. Narrator: THE TEAM HOPES  THAT THE ARCHAEOLOGIST WILL HELP DECIPHER THE CRYPTIC  MARKINGS ON THE BALE SEAL, MARKINGS THAT MIGHT HOLD  SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE TREASURE'S  LOCATION. JAVIER. -SHAWN.  -NICE TO MEET YOU, SHAWN. PLEASE.  -THANKS FOR HAVING US. YEAH. Shawn: BONITA,  BEAUTIFUL HOME. THANKS.  HOW MAY I HELP YOU GUYS? THIS IS WHAT  WE'RE REALLY HOPING YOU CAN IDENTIFY  A LITTLE BETTER. HMM. ♪♪ YOU FIND SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING, VERY EXTRAORDINARY. THESE ARE -- THEY'RE CALLED  BALE SEALS OR CHEST SEALS  OR CLOTH SEALS. AND THIS ONE  IS PRETTY BIG. IT'S AN INDICATOR THAT IT WAS  A VERY VALUABLE SHIPMENT. AT THE BEGINNING,  ARCHAEOLOGISTS WERE NOT GIVING IMPORTANCE  TO THESE THINGS, BUT THEN, STUDYING  THE SYMBOLOGY, WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S MUCH  MORE INFORMATION THAN WE THOUGHT. THEY HAD VERY IMPORTANT  INFORMATION FROM WHO WAS SENDING  THE PACKAGE, SOMETIMES WHO'S  RECEIVING IT ALSO. IT'S VERY INTERESTING  SYMBOLS IN HERE. YOU HAVE THE SYMBOLS  OF WHO IS MAKING IT. IS THAT IHS? CORRECT. THAT'S THE JESUIT'S SYMBOL  THEY ARE STILL USING NOWADAYS. AND YOU SEE THERE  ARE SOME LINES HERE. THIS WOULD BE THE LOCATION. ONE IS ORIGIN.  THE OTHER ONE IS DESTINATION. BUT THERE ARE THESE WAVY LINES,  RIGHT? THE WAVY LINE  WOULD MEAN A RIVER. THERE ARE THREE WAVY LINES,  THEN IT WOULD BE THREE RIVERS. THEY ARE CROSSED WITH A LINE,  RIGHT, WITH A SLASH. MAYBE THREE RIVERS  THAT HAD DRIED UP OR... COMING TOGETHER  OF THREE RIVERS? MAYBE, YEAH. SO THESE THREE RIVERS ARE ACTUALLY THE ORIGIN. YES, IT WOULD BE. Shawn: WHEN GONZALO WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM  THE THREE SQUIGGLY LINES COULD BE THE MEETING  OF THREE RIVERS, IT TOLD ME WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THE POINT OF ORIGIN  WAS LA PLAZUELA BECAUSE THE MONASTERY  IS NEAR THE CONFLUENCE OF THREE RIVERS IN THE VALLEY. SO, PROFESSOR, IF THAT'S THE PLACE OF ORIGIN, THEN WHAT'S THE DESTINATION? WELL, IT'S DOUBLED HERE. IT'S THE SAME SYMBOL  FOR ORIGIN AND DESTINATION. Shawn: IF THE POINT OF ORIGIN  AND POINT OF DESTINATION IS THE SAME THING,  I MEAN, THAT'S THE KEY. WE MIGHT BE CLOSING IN  ON THE DESTINATION. ♪♪ SUBTITLED BY DIEGO MORAES
