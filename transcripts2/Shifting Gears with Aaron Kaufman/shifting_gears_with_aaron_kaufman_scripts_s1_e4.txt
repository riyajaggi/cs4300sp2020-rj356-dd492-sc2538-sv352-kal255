 I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVE MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HAND-PICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL.

 AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST. I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS TONIGHT, I TAKE ON LARGER-THAN-LIFE OPPORTUNITIES... YOU SAID FIND YOU A TRUCK, I FOUND YOU ONE. I THINK SHE'S JUST PERFECT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT PERFECT OR NOT, BUT YOU DID FIND ME A TRUCK. ...AND CONFRONT EXPLOSIVE OBSTACLES HEAD-ON. THIS TIME, I'M TAKING A SEMI-TRUCK...

 ONE OR TWICE IN THEIR LIFE. ...TURNING IT INTO A RACECAR. THEN LATER, I TAKE MY ADVENTURES TO A WHOLE NEW ALTITUDE. SAY, YOU KNOW FARMERSVILLE? YEAH, FARMERSVILLE'S THAT WAY. THIS IS MELISSA. WE GO RIGHT, THE OLD PART OF TOWN'S UP HERE. OLD PART TOWN'S STRAIGHT, OLD PART TOWN'S STRAIGHT. NO. THAT TAKES YOU OUT IN THE COUNTRY. YEAH, BUT YOU GO OUT HERE, THAT'S WHERE THOSE OLD BUILDINGS ARE. NO, GO STRAIGHT. CHRIS RUSSMEN. YOU MIGHT WANNA SLOW DOWN. THESE SMALL-TOWN COPS MAY NOT KNOW YOU. SMALL-TOWN COP GOTTA CATCH ME. SO WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, MY GRANDPARENTS WERE HAVING A SEPTIC SYSTEM DUG. BIG OLD DUMP TRUCK SHOWS UP, AND IT'S GOT A BACK HOE. SO IN MY LITTLE BRAIN, IT WAS ABOUT THE COOLEST THING I'D EVER SEEN. SO I DRUG A CHAIR OUT THERE AND SAT IN THE FIELD AND WATCHED THEM DIG A HOLE. AND AS MY MOTHER RECALLS, MY EXPLANATION WAS, "I LOVE THAT BIG, OLE DIRTY TRUCK. NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED FROM THAT. I MAY BE A LITTLE LARGER, BUT THAT MENTALITY IS STILL THERE. YOU SAID FIND YOU A TRUCK, I FOUND YOU ONE THE NEXT DAY. I THINK SHE'S JUST PERFECT. GOTTA A 60 SERIES DETROIT IN IT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PERFECT OR NOT, BUT YOU DID FIND ME A TRUCK. YEAH, EXACTLY. YEAH. I'VE ALWAYS HAD A FASCINATION WITH WORK TRUCKS, AND I LOVE RACECARS, SO THE COMBINATION OF WORK TRUCK, RACECAR SEEMS LIKE A WONDERFUL IDEA. FAST FORWARD, A GOOD BUDDY OF MINE, CHRIS RUSSMAN FOUND ONE, AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT. SO WHAT DID YOU SAY IT WAS WE'RE GOING TO SEE? IT'S A STERLING. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT STERLING IS WHAT BECAME THE FORD SEMI-TRUCKS. ESSENTIALLY A FORD, WITH A DIFFERENT SYMBOL ON THE FRONT. THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE. PRETTY MUCH, I'VE BEEN AROUND DIESEL MY ENTIRE LIFE. MY DAD WAS A TRUCKER, MY GRANDPA WAS A TRUCKER. WELL MY PRIMARY ROLE IN THIS PROJECT IS GONNA BE THE ACQUISITION OF THE TRUCK AND THEN THE PARTS. WHAT WAS THIS TRUCK USED FOR BEFORE? HE HAD A BIG, OLE CONDO SLEEPER ON IT, AND IT WAS A FREIGHT HAUL TRUCK. OH. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME IT WAS ON THE ROAD? ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO -- A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. SO THERE'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THIS MOTOR IN ITS CONDITION NOW, WE CAN HOP UP AND GO RACE WITH IT? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BIG-RIG RACING STARTED IN THE NORTHEAST IN THE LATE 1970s. IN THE BEGINNING, MOST WERE WORKING TRUCK DRIVERS WHO TOOK TO THE TRACK FOR A CHANCE AT WEEKEND GLORY. OH, WE'VE GOT A TRUCK SIDEWAYS! TRUCK #92, BILL OAK. BUT BY THE 1990s... WOW! ...SEMI RACING HAD VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARED IN THE U.S., BUT WAS STILL POPULAR OVERSEAS. NOW SEMI-TRUCK RACING IS BACK AND GROWING IN THE U.S. SHORT TRACKS, OVALS, DRAG RACING -- BIG-RIG RACE TRUCKS AT WELL OVER 10,000 POUNDS FLYING AROUND CORNERS AND CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER, WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE? SIGN ME UP. SO THIS GUY RUNS A GRAVEL YARD BACK HERE? YEAH, DO GRAVEL WORK, DOZER WORK, AND HAUL A LITTLE SAND AND GRAVEL TO PEOPLE, FIXING DRIVEWAYS AND STUFF. ALRIGHT, WELL LET'S SEE IF WE CAN RELIEVE HIM OF A TRUCK. THERE YOU GO. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT BOOGER RIGHT THERE, MAN. THAT IS AN OLD STERLING TRUCK. WHAT WE HAVE IS WE'VE GOT AN '01 STERLING SEMI. AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAD REMOVED OFF OF IT WAS THE SLEEPER AND THE WET KIT ON THE BACK. - HEY. JACK. - CHRIS, HOW YOU DOING? JACK, AARON. NICE TO MEET YOU - SO THIS IS RACE EQUIPMENT, HUH? - THERE SHE IS IN ALL HER GLORY. YEAH, AND THEN SOME. MY NAME IS JACK CARPENTER. CHRIS ASKED ME IF I KNEW SOMEBODY THAT HAD A PARTICULAR TRUCK FOR SELL WITH A MOTOR IN IT. I SAID, YEAH, I GOT ONE. IT'S GOT THE 60 SERIES DETROIT IN IT. IT'S 470 HORSEPOWER. OKAY, WE AIM TO PUSH THAT UP A FAIR AMOUNT. SO WHEN I SAW THE TRUCK, YOU KNOW, THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS DOES IT RUN. I'M TOLD THAT IT DOES, BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT. LET'S LOOK AT THE MOTOR. THAT'S THE PART I'M AFTER. - YES, SIR. - I'VE BECOME SO ENAMORED WITH THE DETROIT MOTOR -- THE SERIES 60, TO BE EXACT. THEY JUST COULDN'T BE MORE SIMPLE. THAT BEING SAID, IT MAKES GOBS AND GOBS OF POWER. MY QUESTION IS, DOES IT RUN? YEAH, WE CAN START IT REAL QUICK. - OKAY. - YOU'VE GOTTA MASH THE CLUTCH. AFTER THE ENGINE FIRED UP, I WAS CURIOUS HOW MUCH BLOW BY THERE WAS. AND BLOW BY IS REALLY AN INDICATION OF HOW MUCH WEAR THERE HAS BEEN IN THE MOTOR. SO WHENEVER YOU PULL THE DIPSTICK, IF IT'S HUFFING OUT OF IT, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL BLOW BY. THE MORE THAT IT IS, THE MORE THE ENGINE'S WORE OUT. THIS HAD VIRTUALLY NO VISIBLE BLOW BY. - DO YOU WANNA DRIVE IT? - YEAH. THERE YOU GO. COME ON IN. JUST MASH THE YELLOW BUTTON, PUT IT IN GEAR, AND GO. HOW DID IT MAKE IT THIS FAR IN MY LIFE WITHOUT ONE OF THESE THINGS? HEY, EVERYBODY GOT TO HAVE A BIG TRUCK ONCE OR TWICE IN THEIR LIFE. WHOO! HE'S WORSE THAN A KID. OH, HE'S WAY WORSE THAN A KID. WELL THIS OLD GIRL DEFINITELY BEEN ON THE ROAD A LOT LONGER THAN MOST OF MY PICKUP TRUCKS, THAT'S FOR SURE. EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOT A MILLION MILES ON IT, IT RUNS REALLY, REALLY WELL. CONSIDERING WE GOT UP TO A WHOPPING 4.2 MILES AN HOUR. I'D SAY IT DROVE GREAT. I DON'T THINK HE RACING SITUATION WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT, BUT WE DID GO AROUND IN A CIRCLE. IT WAS WEIRD, LIKE I FEEL LIKE I'VE GROWN UP. I FEEL LIKE A REAL MAN. YOU WANNA DRIVE IT TO DALLAS RIGHT NOW, DON'T YOU? I ALMOST LEFT IN IT A MINUTE A GO. WHAT I WAS AFTER WAS A CHEAP TRUCK THAT RAN WELL WITH A DETROIT IN IT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS THING ON THE RACETRACK IN TWO WEEKS OR LESS. I MIGHT HAVE IT OUT ON THE RACETRACK TONIGHT. YEAH. I KNEW I WANTED IT. THE FACT IT WAS DIRTY AND BEAT DOWN, IT WAS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. NOW, I WAS QUOTED A PRICE ON THIS, AND I WAS TOLD THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A BUY ONE, GET ONE, KIND OF THING. IS THAT STILL THE CASE? YEAH, I GOT ONE THAT WILL GO WITH IT, IF YOU WANT IT. - PARTS TRUCK? - PARTS TRUCK. YEAH, CAN WE GO LOOK AT THE OTHER TRUCK? I KNEW THERE WAS ANOTHER TRUCK THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT. PRETTY MUCH WAS A TWO FOR ONE DEAL, IT WAS JUST WHETHER OR NOT I NEEDED IT OR WANTED IT. THIS HAS GOT THE SUSPENSION I WANT ON IT, THAT'S FOR SURE. SO THE OTHER ONE WAS JUST AIR LEAKED, BIG, OLE, LIKE, ONE TRAILING ARM ON THE BACK OF IT. THIS ONE'S GOT A LITTLE FOUR LINK ON IT SO IT WILL MAINTAIN A PINION ANGLE A LITTLE BETTER. AND IT'S GOT -- IT'S GOT A CAB THAT HASN'T HAD ANY HAMMERS USED ON THE ROOF. YEAH, THAT CAB COULD COME IN HANDY. THE RED TRUCK HAS A NICE CAB ON IT AND IT'S GOT THE REAR SUSPENSION WE'RE AFTER. I'M GETTING SOME PARTS THAT I REALLY, REALLY WANT OUT OF IT. AND, SO, WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKE THE TWO FOR ONE DEAL. WHAT DID WE AGREE ON THESE THINGS? WE AGREED ON $5,000. - OKAY. - FOR THE PAIR. I THINK THAT'S A FAIR NUMBER, IF YOU WAS WILLING TO DRAG THESE TO DALLAS, I'LL DO THE DEAL. YEAH, I CAN TAKE THEM DOWN THERE FOR YOU. - OKAY, THEN LET'S DO IT MAN. - ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT, THANKS. I'M GONNA HEAD BACK TO THE SHOP. I'M INCREDIBLY HAPPY. I THINK $5,000 FOR A RACE TRUCK AND SPARES, I THINK IS GOOD. I'M GONNA MAKE A RACECAR. THIS IS ALMOST LIKE THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE. MY FIRST BIG TRUCK. DID YOU SEE MY TRUCK? I'M REALLY EXCITED. I JUST BOUGHT MY FIRST SEMI, YOU KNOW? IT'S OLD, IT'S KINDA A PIECE OF CRAP, BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF FUN, YOU KNOW? UNLESS YOU THINK -- WELL, WE CAN'T GO IN THAT DOOR RIGHT THERE. OH, WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL CLEAR THE DOORS. YEAH, CONVERTIBLE BABY. YEAH, WE GOT A SAWZALL. THAT'S ALL YOU NEED. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE LARGEST BUILD WE'VE EVER DONE, NOT BY THE SCOPE OR THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE, BUT ACTUALLY IN PHYSICAL SIZE. THIS IS THE LARGEST ONE. - THAT THING'S SICK, DUDE. - LOOK HOW SMALL HE IS IN THAT THING. YEAH, I LIKE THAT STERLING FRONT-END. - I THINK IT'S COOL. - YOU READY TO DO THIS? IT'S JUST REALLY, REALLY BIG. - STILL GOOD? - YEAH. KEEP IT STRAIGHT. THIS SEEMED LIKE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPOSE BIG TRUCKS IN GENERAL AND JUST KINDA EXPLORE AN AVENUE THAT WE'VE NEVER BUILT IN BEFORE. WE GOTTA SHORTEN THAT TURD A LOT. GOT OURSELVES A BIG TRUCK, BOYS. I LIKE IT. - WHAT MOTOR'S IN THERE? - D-60. WE'RE ALL PRETTY EXCITED TO BE WORKING ON THE BIG SEMI. BUT NOBODY'S MORE EXCITED THAN JASON. OBVIOUSLY I LOVE WORKING ON ENGINES, AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK ON ONE OF THESE BIG TRUCKS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE A CHALLENGE, IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF FUN. ONCE YOU GET PAST EVERYTHING'S REALLY, REALLY BIG, THERE'S NOTHING TO THIS TRUCK AT ALL. IT'S JUST AN INLINE SIX, RADIATOR, INNER-COOLER, - AND THE CAB -- - IT'S A BIG INLINE SIX, THOUGH. - IT'S A BIG INLINE SIX. - HOLY CRAP. THE SMALLEST BOLT ON THIS THING IS AT THE LARGER END OF MY SOCKET DRAWER. - WHERE ARE WE RACING? - COLORADO SPRINGS. - REALLY? - THIS YEAR, THE BEST SEMI RACERS IN THE WORLD GATHER IN COLORADO SPRINGS FOR A BIG PRE-SEASON SHAKE-DOWN OF THEIR RIGS. I THOUGHT WHAT AN EXCELLENT TIME TO GO SEE WHAT OUR TRUCKS CAN DO AGAINST THEIRS. DOING THINGS VIOLENT AND FAST IS NOT IN THEIR NATURE, WHICH ONCE AGAIN MAKES THEM AS FUN AS THEY CAN BE. THE SCARY THING IS THAT MOST RACETRACKS, THE BARRICADES AND RUN-UPS AND STUFF ARE MADE FOR CARS THAT WEIGH 3,000 POUNDS, AND THIS THING IS MASSIVE. THEY EACH WEIGH 11,500. IF TWO OF THESE TRUCKS GET HUNG TOGETHER, WE'RE TALKING 23,000 POUNDS, 100 MILES AN HOUR, AND THEN BARRICADES BEING FOUR FOOT TALL AND YOU KNOW, CABLES AND FENCING. - SPEED BUMPS. - RIGHT. YEAH. IT'LL GO THROUGH THE STANDS AND IT'LL GO THROUGH THE CARS IN THE PARKING LOT, YOU KNOW -- CAN I DRIVE? THIS SOUNDS LIKE FUN. SO, IT'S LIKE THE LAWSUIT WILL BE NUTS, BUT THE RIDE WILL BE PRETTY WILD. WHEN THESE TRUCKS ARE DOING 90, 100 MILES AN HOUR, IT'S LIKE THE APOCALYPSE RACING DOWN THE FRONT STRAIGHT. YOU KNOW, IT'S PRETTY WILD. I'M GLAD YOU'RE A TOUCH ON THE CRAZY SIDE, 'CAUSE THIS LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN. YEAH, OH. THIS THING'S WILD, MAN. YEAH, COOL, MAN. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU HAD A HOLD OF IT? I DID. IT'S GONNA BE A BIGGER PROJECT THAN HE THINKS. OH! IT AIN'T GO NO BRAKES. IS THIS A DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME MOMENT? - YOU NEED TO PUSH. - YOU AIN'T GONNA STOP IT. WHOO-HOO. I LOVE AIRPLANES. I MIGHT LIKE 'EM MORE THAN CARS. THIS SEEMED LIKE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE STUFF YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. YEAH! - WHOOPS, THEY FLOPPED UP. - THEY UP. - HEY! - WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU GOTTA GO THAT WAY TO BE ABLE TO COME THIS WAY. SO TODAY'S DAY ONE ON OUR RACE TRUCK BUILD. THESE MIRRORS ARE MESSED UP. WE WILL FIND OUT VERY QUICKLY HOW THICK OUR SLAB IS INSIDE THE SHOP BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS HEAVY ON THIS. YOU GOT ROOM FOR THE FORKLIFT FOR FRANK, YOU THINK? OR DO I NEED TO BACK UP A LITTLE MORE? RIGHT HERE IS GOOD. ALRIGHT, GOOD. WHAT'S THE GOAL? WE'RE GONNA TAKE AN OVER THE ROAD WORK TRUCK AND TURN IT INTO A RACECAR. AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT ABOUT AS FAST AS WE CAN. MUCH OF IT IS LIGHTENING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS HEAVY ON THIS. WE DON'T NEED TWO AXLES. WE ONLY NEED ONE. AND THEN OUR TRUCK IS QUITE LONG. SO WE'LL BE REMOVING A LARGE PORTION OFF THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. I DON'T NEED ANY OF THE CREATURE COMFORTS IN THE DASH. WE'LL REMOVE ALL THE A.C. SYSTEM. WE'LL SHEET METAL THE DASH, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA INCREASE SAFETY, SEAT HARNESS, FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM. WE'LL LOCK THE CAB IN PLACE. WE'LL CAGE IT. WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE FUEL TANKS FROM OUTSIDE THE FRAME WHERE THE TRUCKS MAKE CONTACT AND WE'RE GONNA PUT A FUEL CELL IN BETWEEN THE FRAME RAILS WHERE IT'S SAFE. THEN, WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOTOR, OUR GOAL IS TO DOUBLE POWER OUTPUT ON THIS THING AND THEN INCREASE ITS ABILITY TO TURN AND STOP. SO WE'LL MOVE THE MOTOR AND TRANS BACK, AND THEN LOWERING IT SUBSTANTIALLY. AND THE CLOSER WE GET THE CENTER OF GRAVITY TO THE GROUND, THE BETTER IT WILL GO AROUND A CORNER. THE SERIES 60, IT'S A MASSIVE MOTOR. IT'S BUILT TO DO MASSIVE WORK. AND WE'RE GONNA COMPLETELY CHANGE ITS DIRECTION AND MAKE IT GO AS FAST AS IT CAN GO. AND, SO, WE'RE GONNA PUT A MUCH MEANER TURBOCHARGER, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN INCREASED FUEL SYSTEM WITH BIGGER INJECTORS ON IT, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TUNING THAT HANDLES THAT APPROPRIATELY. THAT'S IT -- BIGGER TURBO, MORE FUEL, ZOOM, ZOOM. LISTEN, LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET THIS THING STRIPPED. - HERE WE GO. - WE NEED TO REMOVE EVERYTHING THAT MAKES IT AN OVER THE ROAD SEMI -- THE EXTERNAL FUEL TANKS, THE EXTERNAL BATTERY MOUNTS. SO IT'S GONNA BE A LONG DAY OF JUST CHUNKING TRASH. DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. DOWN, DOWN, ALRIGHT. NOW TIP 'EM BACK A LITTLE. - WE'RE CLEAR SO FAR, JUST STRAP. - YEAH, GO ON. YOU'RE FINE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THE SHOP HAS ANY BIG TRUCK EXPERIENCE. TURN WRENCHES ON 'EM? NO. AND, SO, WE'LL JUST FIGURE IT OUT AS WE GO. WATCH OUT. THEM TOES. DON'T BE OLE "NINE-TOE" RUSSMANN. NOT THAT THERE WON'T BE A COUPLE CURVE BALLS, BUT ULTIMATELY, IT'S JUST A MACHINE. A MAN BUILT IT. A MAN CAN TAKE IT APART. SHOW THAT THING WHO THE BOSS IT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU HAD AHOLD OF IT, CHRIS. I DID. THIS IS GONNA BE INTERESTING, AT BEST, WATCHING HIM BUILD A BIG TRUCK FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE HAS A TENDENCY TO THINK EVERYTHING'S EASY, BUT IT'S GONNA BE A BIGGER PROJECT THAN HE THINKS. CHRIS, TELL ME ABOUT THIS. WHAT IS IT? LOOK AT THOSE BOLTS ON THERE. THERE'S NO HEAD ON 'EM. THEY'RE SOME KIND OF HUB BOLT. THEY GOT A HYDRAULIC GIZMO THAT JUST SQUEEZES THEM ON IN THE FACTORY. WELL, YEAH, BUT THEY'RE THREADED. I KNOW. WELL, THE THEORY IS YOU CAN TAKE 'EM OFF. NO, YOU CAN'T. SO, I FOUND A BUNCH OF BOLTS ON THIS TRUCK THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A HEAD ON EITHER SIDE OF IT. IT'S A LOT LIKE A REVERSE NUT-- NUTSERT. A REVERSE NUT-- NUTSO-- WHAT? NUTSERT, A REVERSE NUT CERT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SPEAKING A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW? BIG TRUCK GUYS JUST WORRY ABOUT GETTING DIRTY AND GETTING THE JOB DONE. THEY DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT IT'S CALLED, WHAT THEY'RE WORKING ON USUALLY. WELL, I DON'T HAVE SOCKETS FOR A COMPLETELY ROUND HEAD. YOU KNOW? I HAD NO IDEA, I'D NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE. I'M ABOUT TO SEE A BUNCH OF CUT-UP ONES. OH, YEAH, BE A BUNCH OF CUT-UP ONES. RIGHT NOW I HAVE ONE GOAL, AND THAT'S TO GET ALL OF THESE OFF. AND I HAVE ONE TOOL HERE THAT DOES IT REALLY WELL. I CALL IT THE SMOKE WRENCH. KEEP CUTTING THIS STUFF OFF, IT'LL ALL COME OFF TOGETHER. BE MINDFUL OF ALL THAT PLASTIC ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT. WATCH OUT, YOU GOT THAT OPEN FUEL LINE. THERE MAY BE A WONDERFUL FIRE. THAT'LL SEND SOMEONE TO FORTH WORTH IN THE MORNING. YEAH! SO ONCE WE CHOP OFF THE HEAD WITH THE TORCH, WE STILL HAVE TO GET 'EM OUT OF THE HOLE. AND THE AIR HAMMER IS JUST THE EASIEST, FASTEST AND DEFINITELY THE MOST FUN WAY OF DOING IT. I DON'T HOW MANY BOLTS IT TAKES TO HOLD THIS THING TOGETHER, BUT I DEFINITELY KNOW HOW MANY THEY USED. IT'S ALL OF THEM. THIS TRUCK HAS A MILLION MILES ON IT. LOOK AT THAT SPAGHETTI GOING EVERYWHERE. AND, SO, MOST EVERYTHING ON THIS TRUCK IS WORE OUT. UGH, SON OF A BITCH. HEY CHRIS, WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME? - I WIN! - I LOOSENED IT FOR YA. SURE. ALRIGHT. IT'S TIME TO PULL THE AXLE. HOLD ON, DON'T DO IT YET. YEP, THAT'S IT. THIS THING AIN'T EVEN CONNECTED NO MORE. OH, THIS WHOLE REAR END'S LOOSE? YEAH. - WELL, LOOK AT YOU. - ABOUT AS LOOSE AS YOU REAR END. -LOOK AT YOU. WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE FUN, CHRIS. NOT QUITE. WE GOTTA PICK IT UP HERE. ALRIGHT, YOU READY? YEAH. GIVE HER HELL. GIVE HER HELL. - THATAGIRL. - KEEP GOING. HEY. WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD. NO MAS. OKAY, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. LET'S CLEAR THE FRAME AND CHOP THIS THING. WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHRIS? SHOULD WE CUT THIS TRUCK IN HALF? - LET'S DO IT. - ALRIGHT. YEAH, THAT'D BE THE DEAL RIGHT THERE. YEAH, THAT'S NOT BAD. ALRIGHT, LET'S GO CUT THE RED ONE IN HALF. LET'S DO IT. BEFORE WE CAN CANNIBALIZE ANY THE PARTS OF THE RED TRUCK, WE HAVE TO GET IT OFF THE DELIVERY FLATBED AND INTO THE SHOP. BUT WITHOUT THE ENGINE, BRAKES, OR EVEN POWER STEERING, THIS IS A TASK THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE. YOU THINK IF YOU HOOK A CHAIN TO THAT THING, TO THE FRONT, AND YOU SLOWLY JUST LET THE THING ROLL, YOU THINK IT'LL PULL THIS THING, JUST FROM THAT LITTLE BIT? IT'LL PULL THIS THING ALONG THE GROUND? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DON'T WANNA BE THE ONE TO TEST IT OUT. I WOULD THINK YOU COULD USE THIS TO SLOW IT DOWN AND JUST LET IT GET OFF THE TRAILER. HE'S A HEAVY EQUIPMENT GUY. YEAH, HE WOULD BE GOOD TO ASK. - NOT ME. - YEAH, NOT ME EITHER, HUH? - SIR? - YES, SIR. DO YOU NOT THINK THAT FORKLIFT WITH A CHAIN TO IT WOULD SLOW IT DOWN ENOUGH TO ROLL IT OFF THE TRAILER? HOW FAR IS IT REALLY GONNA GO? PROBABLY TO KNOCK THAT POWER LINE DOWN. NO, NO, I'M GONNA DRIVE IT. THERE'S STILL SOMEBODY THERE TO STEER IT. YOU AIN'T GONNA STOP IT, THOUGH. IT AIN'T GOT NO BRAKES. YEAH, BUT THERE'S A LONG ROAD. YOU THINK I'M GONNA GET TO THE -- I WANNA SEE. SO WE'LL JUST USE THE FORKLIFT. SO OUR PLAN IS TO STRAP OUR FORKLIFT TO OUR 15-TON TRUCK, AND LET IT SLOWLY ROLL OF THE RAMP. IS THIS A "DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME" MOMENT? - READY? - YEAH. - LET IT RIP. - VERY SLOOOOOOW-MO. WELL, THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK. YOU NEED TO PUSH. - THERE WE GO. - WHOO-HOO. - YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. - AND AFTER A FEW PUSHES... - WE'RE ALMOST THERE. - WHOO-HOO! - EASY, PEASY. - IT ALL WORKED OUT PERFECTLY. YOU GOT A PLAN? THERE WE GO! ALRIGHT, OVER THE CURB WE GO THEN. WELL, ALMOST PERFECTLY. SOUNDS LIKE THE TITANIC. DESPITE SOME MINOR HICCUPS, IT ALL WORKED OUT. NOBODY GOT HURT, AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE WAS HAPPY. -THAT WAS UNEVENTFUL. I WAS HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING, FORKLIFT DO SOMETHING OR... - AT LEAST MAKE A BIG BANG. - YEAH. OH, THERE WE GO. THIS LITTLE FORKLIFT DOES WORK, DUDE. Hello. THIS IS AARON DOWN AT ARCLIGHT. WE'RE MAKING THIS SEMI A RACECAR, AND I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU'D COME BY AND LAY EYES ON MY MONSTROSITY HERE AND SEE WHAT YOU THOUGHT. I'VE GOT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN THESE TRUCKS. I DON'T HOLD A CDL, I AM NOT AN OVER THE ROAD TRUCKER, SO THIS IS REALLY FOREIGN TO ME. BUT THE ONE THING IS, I GOT A GOOD TALENT POOL FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. SOME GOOD FRIENDS, THAT THIS IS THEY EAT, SLEEP, AND BREATHE THIS STUFF. I HAVE A GREAT FRIEND. HE IS THEDUDE WHEN IT COMES TO RACE SEMIS. WHO IS THAT GUY? YOU'RE GONNA BE A HERO, OR YOU'RE GONNA BE A ZERO. I'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT. HELL, WE'LL HAVE A TRUCK RUNNIN' TONIGHT. THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE. THE SEAL IS WRONG. YOU'RE KIDDING. - NO, SIR. - IT DIDN'T SET EVEN. I THINK SOMEBODY'S GOT THE WRONG TOOL. - HE LIVES. - GOOD MORNING, SIR. - YEAH, HOW ARE YOU? - BEEN A LONG TIME. YEAH, YEAH. I'M ROBERT BALL, THE ENGINEER FOR DETROIT REMANUFACTURING IN CAMBRIDGE, OHIO. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON DIESEL ENGINES SINCE I WAS ABOUT 16. BEEN A COUPLE DAYS. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? I DON'T KNOW, SHOW ME. COME ON AND LET HIM LOOK AT THE TRUCK. BOB BALL WORKS AT DETROIT. IF YOU KNOW BOB, YOU CAN MAKE THE HORSEPOWER A WHOLE LOT EASIER AND MAKE IT A FULL-BLOWN HOT ROD. BASICALLY, CHRIS RUSSMAN AND HIS TWO-MAN ARMY DESTROYED THIS THING OVER HERE. AND HE NIPPED OFF ENOUGH FRAME TO LEAVE MAX WHEEL BASE PLUS TIRE PLUS THE FOOT. AND, SO, EVERY POSSIBILITY STILL EXISTS. ALRIGHT. LOOKS LIKE A GOOD START. IT LOOKS LIKE A REAL GOOD START. OBVIOUS, YOU KNOW WE'RE ON, MUCH LIKE ALWAYS, WE'RE ON A REALLY, REALLY TIGHT TIMEFRAME. SO WE REALLY KINDA WANNA STICK WITH AS MANY OVER THE COUNTER PARTS AS WE CAN. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE TRY AND DO. THE TRUCK NEEDS TO BE IN COLORADO SPRINGS PRETTY SOON SO WE CAN TEST IT AGAINST OTHER SEMI RACE TRUCKS. AND BOB CAN ONLY GET OUT OF WORK FOR ABOUT A WEEK. SO BOB DEFINITELY HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM. THIS MOTOR'S GOT A MILLION MILES ON IT. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S EVER BEEN MESSED WITH. IT'S A SERIES 60. THEY'RE BULLETPROOF. I DON'T KNOW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT THE SERIES 60. AND YOU'RE THEDETROIT DUDE. SO I BECAME A LITTLE BIT OF A FAN THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU. MY FIRST YEAR AT PIKE'S PEAK, I MET ROBERT BALL AND HIS CREW UP THERE WITH THE FREIGHTLINER. THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT ON THE MOUNTAIN. IT WOULD PULL THE TREES OVER AS IT WENT BY. RACING SEMIS HAS BEEN JUST A LOT OF FUN TO BE HAD. THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR RELATIONSHIP AND OUR FRIENDSHIP. FAST FORWARD, LAST YEAR, I WENT AND RACED ONE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. ALRIGHT, MAN, YOU GOOD TO GO THIS TIME? I GOT HIM IN TO A BIG TRUCK AND KINDA GOT HIM HOOKED. ALONGSIDE OF GETTING HIM RAN OVER BY MY SON. BASICALLY, HE GOT SIDEWAYS, AND JUSTIN RUN HIM OVER. WHEN YOU RUN 'EM INTO EACH OTHER, THEY KINDA BLOW UP IN SPECTACULAR FORM. I THINK HE WANTS REDEMPTION FOR THE LAST TIME. THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP HERE. THE QUESTION ON EVERYBODY'S MIND, HOW MUCH POWER ARE WE GONNA MAKE OUT OF THIS BIG TRACTOR? - OH, WE'LL DO AN EASY 850. - YEAH. AN EASY 850. WE'RE REALLY AFTER FOUR NUMBERS HERE. WE REALLY NEED FOUR DIGITS, BOB. I MEAN WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU, BUDDY. SO WE MAKE 470 NOW, 500 HORSE. OUR GOAL IS SOMEWHERE AROUND 1,000. HE GOES, "WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A BIGGER MOTOR." YEAH. WE CAN PROBABLY GET IT THERE. WE'VE GOT SOME FUNKY TURBO SET UPS AND WE'VE GOT SOME BIG INJECTORS. AND THIS THING BEING YOUR BABY, WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME POWER, SO WE JUST NEED TO RECONFIGURE THE TRUCK AND GET IT LIGHTER. WE'RE GONNA GO RACE WITH A TRACTOR. YOU'RE GONNA BE A HERO, OR YOU'RE GONNA BE A ZERO. I'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT. THIS IS GONNA BE A LOT OF FUN, TAKE AN OLD SLOW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND TURN IT INTO A RACECAR, HOT ROD. I'M GONNA GO GET OUT OF THIS AND INTO SOMETHING I CAN GET DIRTY. ALRIGHTY, SIR. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. SO, NOW I'M GONNA... 191, 193, 191, SO THESE ARE THE TWO SHALLOW ONES. WE'RE GOING RACING WITH THIS TRUCK, AND, SO, WE HAVE TO DO SOME RACECAR STUFF TO IT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN INCREASED FUEL SYSTEM, BIGGER INJECTORS ON IT, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TUNING THAT HANDLES THAT APPROPRIATELY. THAT IS SO NUTS, MAN. A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO SEEING ON AN INJECTOR, AIN'T IT? YEAH, THIS THING IS BARELY ONE HANDLE AWAY FROM BEING A SPACE RAY GUN. YEAH, EXACTLY. DETROIT REMAN SENT US A NEW SET OF INJECTORS JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WOULD GET IN THE BOX OFF THE SHELF FOR THIS RACE TRUCK. I'M GONNA START PULLING THE OLD FUEL SYSTEM OFF. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT I NEED BOB BALL. I ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING HIS SON JUSTIN BALL HERE. MAN, IT'S FUNNY. THE LAST TIME I WAS DOWN AT YOUR PLACE, YOU HAD THOSE HARLEYS AND FORDS. NOW IT'S ALL DIESEL. THE LAST TIME I SAW JUSTIN, WE GOT A LITTLE CLOSER THAN WAS COMFORTABLE. IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT HE STILL WANTED TO COME DOWN AND LEND A HAND. GETTING RID OF THESE INJECTORS AND PUTTING SOME BIGGER ONES DOWN IN IT. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND GET SOME MORE FUEL TO IT WHERE WE CAN ADD SOME MORE TO THE TUNE AND TRY TO MATCH FOR THE UPSIZED TURBO. TELL 'EM THE SIMPLE JUST SAY IT TAKES X AMOUNT OF FUEL TO MAKE X AMOUNT OF POWER, AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE X AMOUNT OF POWER, SO WE NEED MORE FUEL. AND THEN JUST THROW THE INJECTOR DOWN. A BIGGER SET OF INJECTORS WILL ALLOW MORE FUEL. THAT'S NUMBER THREE. AND SO, MORE FUEL, BIGGER BOOM, MORE POWER, GO FASTER. THESE ARE THE BIGGEST, BADDEST INJECTORS I'VE EVER LAID EYES ON. - OH, THERE YA GO. - A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, SO THIS IS GOING IN A 460. AND THIS RIGHT HERE COMES IN A SERIES 60. BOB AND JUSTIN MAKE QUICK WORK OF THE INJECTORS, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I WANTED THEM HERE. PLUS, IF ANYONE CAN PUSH THIS THING OVER 1,000 HORSEPOWER, IT'S BOB. SO NOW WE'VE GOT THE INJECTORS, THOSE ARE IN. BOB'S GIVEN THE MOTOR AN ALL CLEAR. Y'ALL READY FOR SOME GO-FAST PARTS? LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT. IT'S TIME TO PUT THE HAIR DRYER, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE TURBO ON. AND CHRIS HAS BROUGHT A BIG ONE FOR US AND A FULL TILT MANIFOLD. SO THE COMBINATION OF BOTH SHOULD LET THIS MOTOR BREATHE. - IT'S PRETTY. - I'M TERRIBLY EXCITED. WE JUST GOTTA GET A CAM COVER PUT BACK ON AND GET SOME OF THIS ON. HELL, WE'LL HAVE A TRUCK RUNNIN' TONIGHT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME. THAT MIGHT NOT BE TRUE. THESE THINGS ARE SLOWER THAN CHRISTMAS... UNTIL WE FIX THEM. THEY GET RIDICULOUSLY FAST. THE COMBINATION OF THESE THINGS WITH THE NEW INJECTORS AND THE NEW TUNE SHOULD PRODUCE THE POWER WE NEED TO GO RACING. PUTTING ALL THEM PRETTY PARTS ON A DIRTY, DIRTY, MOTOR. ANYBODY WHO DOES ANYTHING WITH TURBOCHARGERS KNOWS ONE THING -- JUST KEEP RAMMING IT IN THERE AND THE POWER KEEPS GOING UP UNTIL SOMETHING FLIES OFF OF IT. THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GET SUCH A HEAVY TURBO, CHRIS? -YOU LIKE THAT? PYHOO! SHOULD HAVE A RECESS HERE. THE SEAL IS WRONG. IT'S NOT PRESSED TIGHT AGAINST THAT -- YOU'RE KIDDING. NO, SIR. DIDN'T SET EVEN. THIS LIP AND THIS LIP, THEY'RE OFFSET, OKAY? BEING THAT THIS IS ALL FLAT, IT'S LITERALLY TRYING TO SHOVE THIS RING THROUGH THIS. SO WE RUN INTO A PROBLEM TRYING TO INSTALL THE SEAL ON THE FRONT COVER. BECAUSE WE WERE MISSING A PART FROM THE SEAL DRIVE I BORROWED FROM A FRIEND. THIS IS ON WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT WE NEED TO SET THAT SEAL BACK. AND THAT'S HIS TOOL, SO I'M NOT GONNA CUT IT OR LAY IT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I WOULD IN A HEARTBEAT. IF WE DO, WE KNOW WHAT IT COSTS US. - IT AIN'T COSTING ME. - 470 BUCKS. IT'S NOT OUR TOOL, SO WE CAN'T CUT IT. SEEMS LIKE WE'RE STUCK. AND NOW I HAVE THAT ENTIRE THING SHOVED FLAT ON THERE AND I DON'T LIKE IT. YOU TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THAT THING IN THERE? HE THINKS WE MAY HAVE GOT THE WRONG TOOL. - IT'S PRETTY NERVE RACKING. - ALRIGHT, STOP. ONE WRONG MOVE, AND I COULD CAUSE SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE. I'M GONNA HIT IT. CLEAR, ALRIGHT? - READY? - OKAY, LEFT. THEN RIGHT. OH, MAN, THAT'S COOL! THE SEAL IS WRONG. IT'S NOT PRESSED TIGHT AGAINST THAT -- YOU'RE KIDDING. - NO SIR. - DIDN'T SET EVEN. SO NORMALLY YOU HAVE THIS LIP AND THIS LIP, THEY'RE OFF SET, OKAY. BEING THAT THIS IS ALL FLAT, IT'S LITERALLY TRYING TO SHOVE THIS RING THROUGH THIS. WELL, WHEN WE PULLED IT OFF, IT WAS FLAT. NO, IT WAS NOT. NO, IT WAS NOT. HM. YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THAT THING IN THERE? THE SEAL IS PUSHING ON THE STEEL PLATE IN THE MIDDLE. THE ONLY WAY TO PUT THE SEAL IN APPROPRIATELY SO THAT IT GOES ON STRAIGHT AND FLAT IS WITH A SEAL DRIVER. THE SEAL HAS A LIP ON IT THAT WASN'T FITTING IN THE SEAL DRIVER CORRECTLY. HEY CAN WE CUT A DRAW AND CUT A RING? CREATE A SPACER RING ON OUR MACHINE. I MEAN ONCE THAT'S ON THERE AND WE PUSH THE BUSHING ON, IT WILL BASICALLY SIT LIKE THIS, AND WHEN WE PRESS, WE'RE ONLY PRESSING FROM HERE ONCE IT'S ON. - AND IT WILL BE FLAT? - YEAH. - YES? - I MEAN I THINK THAT WILL FIX OUR PROBLEM. SO WE NEED TO INSTALL A CRANK SEAL, SO I HAVE TO MAKE AN ADAPTER RING TO FIX THE PART OF THE TOOL THAT'S NOT WORKING. JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE OF SECONDS TO SET IT UP. GIVE THAT A SHOT. LET'S SEE IF IT SITS OVER IT. - YEP. - YEP, THAT'S LOOSE. - THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. - THERE YOU GO. THIS MOTOR ORIGINALLY MADE SOMEWHERE AROUND 430 HORSEPOWER. NOW I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE DOUBLED THE HORSEPOWER. NOW WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE. TRANSMISSION! THE TRANSMISSION ARRIVED. IT WAS MASSIVE. SEE THIS BIG-ASS TRANSMISSION THEY JUST BROUGHT IN? DEFINITELY MAN, UNREAL. WHOA! YEAH, NOW I'M GOOD ON THIS SIDE. YES, SIR, YOU ARE. MOST DEFINITELY. IT'S ABOUT READY TO SET THE CAB. CAN WE MAYBE ROTATE THE CAB SO IT'S EASIER TO GRAB? WE CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. SIDEWAYS RIGHT HERE. IT SEEMS LIKE A PERFECTLY OPPORTUNE TIME TO TAKE THE RED CAB OFF OF THE '96 LOUISVILLE CHASSIS, PUT IT ON OUR 01 STERLING CHASSIS. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! YOU'RE ABOUT TO RUN INTO THE CAB, MAN. WHY DON'T YOU BACK UP, AND LET'S TAKE ANOTHER BITE AT IT? THIS IS MY FIRST TRUCK I'VE DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON, SO... SO FAR, EVERYTHING IS LINING UP. COME BACK. WHOA! SIDE SHIFT TO ME. IT'S PRETTY NERVE-RACKING. ONE WRONG MOVE, AND I CAN CAUSE SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE. THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. I CAN PUT A BOLT IN THIS ONE. I WON'T HIT THAT THING, WE'RE ALMOST THERE. OVER HERE, I CAN GET A BOLT IN, TOO... OKAY, COOL! IF WE KNEW WHERE THE BOLTS WERE. YEAH, RIGHT?! SO, THE WHITE TRUCK AND THE RED TRUCK ARE DIFFERENT. THE MOUNTS ARE DIFFERENT. THE BOLTS ARE M.I.A. HEY, JON, WHERE ARE THE BOLTS? WE JUST NEED SOMETHING TO HOLD IT IN PLACE TEMPORARILY. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, BUT I'M NOT SURE. OH, NO, THAT'S NOT IT. NO, TOO BIG? THAT'S BIGGER THAN THE SLEEVE THAT'S IN IT. JON, WHERE ARE THE BOLTS? IN THIS RED BOX. WHAT? I GOT MINE ALL THE WAY THROUGH. JON, I STILL NEED YOU TO COME DOWN. - COME DOWN ABOUT TWO INCHES. - YOU WANT ME TO TILT? - CAN YOU TILT? - YES, SIR. - TILT FORWARD, JON. - COME UP A TOUCH. - UP? - UP! THERE YOU GO. THANKS, ERNIE. THERE WE GO, ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT, HOLD ON. I'M GONNA HIT IT CLEAR, ALL RIGHT? IT'S GONNA DROP A LITTLE BIT. - HERE WE GO. - YEAH! FOUND IT. YEAH, JUST LEAVE THE FRAME BLUE. RED, WHITE AND BLUE, BABY. OH, YEAH. ALL WE'RE MISSING IS A BALD EAGLE. LETS FACE FACTS, IT'S NOT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE TRUCK. SO WE'LL CHECK IT OUT. WE MAY BE ABLE TO BRING ITS SEXY UP A LITTLE BIT. YOU SEE WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE BIG PLANS GETS ME. SO, WE'RE JUST GONNA PUT IT TOGETHER AND GO FAST. IF IT WORKS, IT WORKS. WE'D NOW LIKE TO BREAK FROM OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED BUILD FOR A RIDE IN THE SKY. SO WE'LL BRING RPMs UP, AND THEN IF WE DON'T LET CLUTCH UP, WE LET THE CLUTCH OUT, THE CAR WILL ACCELERATE. IT'LL TAKE OFF. WE DON'T WANT THAT. WHAT WE WANT IS WE WANT TO OVERCOME THE FRICTION BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE GROUND, AND SO PEEL OUT, BASICALLY. ROB HOLLAND IS A UNITED STATES AEROBATIC PILOT AND HE'S INTO CARS, TOO, AND, SO, I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO LITTLE BIT OF A TRADE. I'M GONNA PUT ROB HOLLAND IN THE FALCON AND LET HIM BURN TIRES OFF AND SLIDE THE CAR AROUND SIDEWAYS. - IS THAT OKAY? - THAT IS FREAKING AWESOME. - SO COOL. - WE GET THIS SEAT MOVED BACK, AND IT'S ALL YOURS. - ALRIGHT, MAN. LET'S TRY IT. AND THEN, THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS, HE'S GONNA LET ME RIDE WITH HIM AND EVEN FLY HIS AIRPLANE. SO, YOU CAN ROLL INTO IT, BUT IF YOU ROLL INTO IT YOU'LL COME OUT WIDE, IT'S A LOT HARDER TO CONTROL, IF YOU JUST -- IN THE AIRPLANE, THE GUY'S A MADMAN. WHEN IT COMES TO PAVEMENT, A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF RULES. SO CHECK THIS OUT, TRY... SO TRY LESS GAS OR MORE IN THE STEERING? YEAH, SO, THE BEST WAY TO START WORKING FROM SITTING STILL, WHEEL STRAIGHT HERE, RAH, RAH, RAH, RAH, BANG, AND THEN YOU'RE GONE, AND THE CAR WILL SIT UP AND IT KINDS WANTS TO LEAD THIS WAY AND GET READY TO CATCH IT, 'CAUSE IT'LL TURN RIGHT AROUND. OKAY. HE'S ABSOLUTELY A BETTER PILOT THAN HE IS A DRIVER. I THINK FOR THE FEW MINUTES WE TALKED ABOUT IT, AND WE GOT INTO IT, I THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB. - WHAT YOU THINK? - YEAH, MAN, THAT WAS AWESOME. WE READY TO GO FOR A FLY? LETS GO FLY, MAN. AW, MAN, LETS DO IT! STEP THERE, RIGHT ON TO THE CAB. THIS SEEM LIKE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH AN AIRPLANE, DOING MORE STUFF YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO, WHICH SEEMED RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. YEAH. - ALRIGHT, SO TAKEOFF. - YES, SIR. I WANNA ASK YOU, 'CAUSE THIS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE CAN JUST TAKEOFF, CLIMB UP DO THE AEROBATICS, OR WE CAN TAKEOFF, HALF-ROLL, AND FLY INVERTED DOWN THE RUNWAY. I WANT YOU TO HIT IT. OKAY. YEAH! THAT IS INSANE. READY? OKAY, LEFT. THEN RIGHT. WHOA! OH, MAN, THAT'S COOL! FLYING WITH ROB WAS AWESOME. I LOVE, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE AIRPLANES. ALRIGHT, YOU GOT THE AIRPLANE. THIS TIME ROB'S GONNA SHOW ME HOW TO FLY A COUPLE OF MANEUVERS IN THE AIRPLANE. ALRIGHT, SO LETS DO A ROLL. JUST PULL THE NOSE UP A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT THERE, AND JUST PUSH A TICK LEFT. KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING. EXCELLENT. PRETTY COOL! ALRIGHT, NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN IT, LETS DO A GOOD ONE. ALRIGHT. A LITTLE MORE SPEED, PULL THE NOSE UP. PULL HIGHER. LITTLE HIGHER. LITTLE HIGHER. - YUP. - RIGHT THERE, HOLD THE CLUTCH AND ROLL. LEFT RUDDER, PUSH THE STICK FORWARD. HEY Y'ALL. EASY PULL, EASY PULL. WHOOP, IT FLUFFED UP. SAY A PRAYER, TAKE SOME DUCT TAPE OFF, SEE IF SHE'LL LIGHT. COME ON. MARKER. OH AAH! THERE YOU GO. THERE IT IS. OH, MAN. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU, MAN? - YEAH! - SO SICK. EASY PULL, EASY PULL. WHOOP. IT FLUFFED UP. I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I AIN'T GONNA LIE, I GOT LOST ON THE SECOND ROTATION. LETS DO ANOTHER ONE. ROB HOLLAND IS A AEROBATIC PILOT. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO FLY WITH HIM, AND I'M NOT A PILOT. I'M DEFINITELY NOT A LICENSED PILOT, BUT THEY LET ME LOOSE WITH AN AIRPLANE. I'LL LET YOU TAKE THE AIRPLANE. YOU GOT IT. NO, NO, PUSH FORWARD STICK. -YEAH! LIKE YOU SAID, YOU KEPT ON SAYING, WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS HEADED, SO AFTER WE CAME AROUND ONCE, I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT I NEEDED TO BE DOING, BALANCING OR PUSHING. SO, YEAH, IF YOU LOOK OUT OVER THE NOSE... - YEAH. - ...AND WE'RE TUMBLING, YOU SEE US STARTING TO ROLL THIS WAY, YOU NEED TO GO RIGHT ON.AHH! TO PRODUCE THE MANEUVER WAS EASIER THAN I EXPECTED -- IN FACT SO EASY I WAS LIKE, HOW DO PEOPLE NOT ACCIDENTALLY WRECK THEMSELVES EVERYDAY IN THESE THINGS, RIGHT? ALRIGHT, LET ME TALK YOU THROUGH A LOOP. PUSH THE NOSE DOWN A LITTLE BIT, YOU WANNA GET SOME AIR SPEED. OKAY, START COMING BACK ON THE STICK. YUP. THERE YOU GO. LOOK OUT THE LEFT SIDE SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU ARE, PULL A LITTLE BIT HARDER. NICE! NOW WE PULL THIS UP. NOW RELAX. JUST LET IT FLOAT. ENJOY THE VIEW. HOW SPECTACULAR IS THAT? PRETTY GOOD! NOT KIND OF LIKE A VIDEO GAME, IT'S NOT LIKE A CAR, IT'S LIKE NOTHING ELSE I'VE EXPERIENCED. OKAY, HOLD THE CLUTCH AND LEFT ROLL, GO. ONE MORE ROLL, AND NOW LEFT RUDDER, FORWARD STICK. GONNA HOLD IT RIGHT HERE A WHILE. THERE YOU GO, ONE MORE. HOLD IT, HOLD IT. THERE YOU GO, NOW NEUTRALIZE. WHOA! EXCELLENT, DUDE! DUDE, YOU DID A DOUBLE TUMBLE. WHAT A TRIP, MAN! WAS IT EASY TO DO THE TUMBLE? YES. IS IT EASY TO BE GOOD AT IT? I THINK NOT. WE GOT ABOUT TWO MORE MINUTES WORTH OF GAS. SO, IN THE FUTURE, I ABSOLUTELY WOULD LOVE TO GET MY PILOTS LICENSE. ONE HELL OF A RIDE, SIR. BUT THEN THE OTHER THING IS LIKE I'M KIND OF A CHAMPAGNE TASTE, BEER BUDGET, KIND OF GUY AND SO THE THINGS THAT I LIKE ARE REALLY BEYOND ME. I'D GIVE MORE THUMBS IF I HAD THEM. SURE BEATS WORKING FOR A LIVING, DON'T IT? IT REALLY DOES. SO, WE SHUT THE RUNWAY DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, AND I NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RACE THE FALCON AGAINST AN AIRPLANE. YEAAAAH! MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S BACK TOGETHER. JUST BASICALLY GONNA DO A STARTUP, MAKE SURE WE GOT IT. BOB SPENT THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS HELPING US REBUILD THE ENGINE ON OUR RACE TRUCK. NOW WE JUST GOTTA FIRE IT UP AND LISTEN TO THAT THING PURR. ALRIGHT, NOW JON IS WORKING ON THE BATTERY AND WIRES. HAVE TO WIRE IN OUR ACCELERATOR PEDAL. WE ARE LACKING SHOE LINES. AND WE'LL HAVE TO RUN A SUPPLY AND RETURN LINE DOWN INTO A FIVE GALLON BUCKET RIGHT NOW. IT'S ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND WHEN YOU LIGHT ONE OFF. YOU NEVER KNOW. OH, MY GOODNESS. FRANKENSTEIN IT? - IT'S READY. - ROCK 'N' ROLL. LET'S DO IT. SAY A PRAYER, TAKE SOME DUCT TAPE OFF, SEE IF SHE'LL LIGHT. I'M GONNA GO HOME UPSET. ANYBODY THAT NEEDS TO DRY THEIR HAIR, STAND ABOUT RIGHT HERE. THAT TURBO WILL DRY YOUR HAIR IN A HURRY. IF YOU LOOKING TO LOSE OR JAR IT, PUT YOUR FINGER ANYWHERE AROUND THAT FRONT THAT EMBLEM, TOO. - EVERYBODY CLEAR?! - CLEAR ENOUGH. ITS BEEN A GOOD WEEK. WE'VE INSTALLED THE TURBO, NEW INJECTORS, NEW EXHAUST MANIFOLD, NEW ECM, AND A NEW CALIBRATION. IT'S FINALLY TIME TO FIND OUT IF THIS THING STILL RUNS. COME ON. NO POWER. NEXT WEEK... HOW THE DO WE EVEN GET THE TUBE OUT? ...THE BUILD IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON THE TEAM. GAH! HEY, MAN, HOLD YOUR PIPE. PIECE OF I'VE GOT, PROBABLY 15, 20 BARS STILL TO BUILD AND BEND AND NOTCH AND PUT IN THE TRUCK. - THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO. - NAH, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
