 Kaufman: I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HANDPICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL. AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST.

 I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS WE FINALLY MADE IT TO KING OF THE HAMMERS. LET'S GO. HE WANTS A FLAG. HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE. LET'S GO! - YEAH! - EVERYTHING IS BIGGER, MEANER, AND GNARLIER HERE THAN I EXPECTED. IS THIS THE HILL CLIMB? CAN'T SEE WE'RE ON FIRE. HOLD ON. IT'S GONNA BLOW UP. IT'S GONNA BLOW UP. THE SMOKE ON THROTTLE WHILE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE ROAD -- IT SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. WHOA! YOU GOT IT.

 YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. WHOA! BIG ROCK! WHAT THE AARON. WE'RE GETTING THERE. 100 DAYS TODAY. HOW WE DOING? HOW YOU FEELING? TIRED. I'M SLEEPY. A LITTLE -- PARDON ME? YOUR MIC DIDN'T SLIP DOWN, DID IT? IT'S BEEN 100 DAYS, AND WE'RE THERE. WE'RE FINISHED. THAT'S THE GREAT PART. IT'S ALL A CULMINATION OF A MILLION DIFFERENT THINGS TO GET US TO THIS POINT RIGHT NOW, AND WE'RE SUPER-EXCITED TO GET OUT THERE, GET ON THE ROAD, AND JUST DO THIS DAMN THING ALREADY. Kaufman: IN FIVE YEARS, THIS IS THE BIGGEST PROJECT THAT I'VE EVER GOT INTO. KING OF THE HAMMERS IS A VERY SERIOUS RACE. A WEEK FROM NOW, THERE MAY BE ZERO TRUCK LEFT. MY EXPERIENCE IN THE TRUCK IS EXTREMELY LOW. MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE OF RACING IS EXTREMELY LOW. AND SO WE HAVE AN UNPROVEN TRUCK, UNPROVEN DRIVER, AND A BIG CHALLENGE. I MEAN, WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE, RIGHT? LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. K.O.H. OR BUST. RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAD WEST TO KING OF THE HAMMERS IN JOHNSON VALLEY, CALIFORNIA. SEE YOU IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT QUITE A FEW MILES AHEAD OF US AND NOT MANY HOURS TO GET THERE. IT'S ABOUT TO BE ONE CRAZY RIDE THROUGH THE NIGHT, THROUGH THE MORNING. BUT NEXT TIME YOU SEE US, WE'LL BE IN HAMMERTOWN AND SEE IF WE CAN PUT DOWN A WHOLE RACE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER? I THINK SHE'S PRETTY DARN CUTE. CUTE? I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU USE THAT WORD. SO, ABOUT 14 WEEKS AGO, I BOUGHT THIS '71 INTERNATIONAL SCOUT OUT OF MY FRIEND CHRIS' BACKYARD. IT'S GONNA FALL! IT'S GONNA FALL! YEAH! OH! WHOO! I REALLY WANTED TO HAVE AN OFF-ROAD TRUCK THAT I COULD DRIVE EVERY DAY BUT HAD REALLY HUGE ABILITIES. BASICALLY, I COULD RUN ANY TRAIL I WANTED, AND I COULD DRIVE IT TO WORK. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT DESECRATING SUCH A RARE BIRD? HOW MANY TIMES DID IT ROLL OVER? HAVE WE CHECKED THIS THING FOR INSECTS YET? A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THE SCOUT BUILD WAS A LITTLE FAR OUT THERE, BUT I WANTED A CHALLENGE. ORIGINALLY, I HAD PLANNED TO GO TO MOAB AND RUBICON. Currie: I'M GONNA BUILD SOMETHING THAT'S FAST IN THE DESERT AND WILL WORK IN THE ROCKS. CHECKING OUT CASEY CURRIE'S ULTRA4 RACECAR DEFINITELY GOT ME EXCITED ABOUT KING OF THE HAMMERS -- THE HARDEST ONE-DAY OFF-ROAD RACE ON THE PLANET. THAT MADE ME FEEL LIKE THE SCOUT COULD GO AND RUN A NETWORK OF TRAILS IN JOHNSON VALLEY CALLED THE HAMMERS. BUT MAYBE NOT AS FAST. WITH MOST OF THE HARD WORK AND LONG NIGHTS BEHIND US, IT'S FINALLY TIME TO FIND OUT IF WE CAN BEAT THE HAMMERS OR IF THE HAMMERS WILL BEAT US. HI. WE MADE IT. I DROVE 1,319 MILES. WE WERE DOWN TO THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE WE COULD EVEN MAKE IT IN TIME. AND WE JUST -- JUST BARELY PULLED IT OFF. WE JUST BARELY GOT HERE. IT'S A RELEASE, YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE TO GET HERE WAS JUST SUCH A DUMP -- AN EMOTIONAL DUMP. CLEAR? I'M HERE. WE GOT HERE. THERE'S A BIG JOB AHEAD OF US, BUT WE MADE IT. THAT IN ITSELF IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THE TRUCK'S OFF. THAT JUST HAPPENED. WELCOME TO HAMMERTOWN. MY TEAM AND I ARE HERE AT KING OF THE HAMMERS FOR THE NEXT FIVE DAYS TO DO TWO THINGS -- TEST OUR SCOUT IN THE WORST OFF-ROAD CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD AND LEARN FROM SOME OF THE BEST ON HOW TO DRIVE IN THIS BONE-CRUSHING TERRAIN. HOW MUCH SLEEP YOU GOING ON THERE, AARON? I WENT TO BED AT 1:30 LAST NIGHT. SO, WHAT IS IT NOW -- 6:30? FIVE HOURS? THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. I'M TAKING PART IN TWO RACES. THURSDAY IS THE 4800 CLASS, OR LEGENDS CLASS, WHICH RUNS 139 MILES AND ALLOWS 10 HOURS TO COMPLETE. I'M RUNNING THAT RACE AS A CO-DRIVER FOR BRIAN TILTON FROM 4x4 OUTLET. BUENOS DIAS, SEÃ‘OR. MY JOB IS TO HELP GUIDE THE PATH THE DRIVER TAKES AS HE PUSHES THE CAR AS HARD AS HE CAN. A GREAT WAY TO SEE HOW A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER NAVIGATES THIS COURSE BEFORE I HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF. FRIDAY'S RACE IS THE 4400, OR THE HAMMERS, WHICH IS THE RACE I'LL BE DRIVING IN THE SCOUT WITH JASON AS MY CO-DRIVER. THIS COURSE IS 202 MILES LONG, AND WE HAVE 14 HOURS TO COMPLETE IT. THESE ARE THE MOST ADVANCED CARS IN THE COMPETITION. THE SORT OF MODIFICATIONS THAT YOU MAKE TO THE CAR DICTATE WHICH RACE YOU ENTER. WHEN RACE DAY COMES, WE'LL TRY AND CROSS THROUGH THE DESERT, DIRT, AND ROCKY TERRAIN TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AND WITHIN THE 14-HOUR TIMELINE. THERE ARE PIT STOPS ALONG THE WAY, AND PLANNING FUEL AND OTHER MECHANICAL NEEDS IS CRITICAL TO FINISHING. LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE DRIVERS AT HAMMERS WILL EVEN FINISH THE RACE. THE SCOUT IS UNTESTED AND UNPROVEN, JUST LIKE MY SKILLS IN THE ROCKS. SOME OF THESE DRIVERS HAVE SPENT CLOSE TO $1 MILLION ON THEIR CAR AND ARE THE BEST DRIVERS IN THE WORLD. I MIGHT BE OUTCLASSED IN THAT REGARD. WE'LL SEE. BUT BEFORE THAT, OUR QUALIFYING RUNS ARE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WHERE WE WILL BE TIMED ON A SHORT, HARD, TWO-MILE LAP, WHICH WILL DICTATE WHERE WE WILL START THE RACE. SO, THERE WILL BE NO ONE ON COURSE BUT US? THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO SLOW DOWN EXCEPT FOR THAT WALL. SO, I'M REALLY, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT CO-DRIVING 4876, A RIDE WITH BRIAN TILTON, A GUY THAT I ONLY MET THIS SUMMER. AND YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU JUST CLICK WITH PEOPLE. IT'S FOOT TO THE FLOOR, NOTHING SLOWING US DOWN. YEP. KING OF THE HAMMERS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY RACE. IT WORKS OUT BETTER FOR THE RHYTHM OF THE RACE IF WE GET THE FASTEST CARS UP FRONT. THE ONLY FAIR WAY TO SAY, "THESE ARE THE FASTEST CARS," IS TO MEASURE THEM. AND THE YARDSTICK THAT WE HAVE TO MEASURE THE RACECARS IS A THING CALLED QUALIFYING. WE TAKE A SINGLE LAP, AND THEN THEY DROP THE FLAG ON AND THEY TIME YOU. THE FASTEST CARS RUNNING THE LAP -- THAT'S HOW YOU'RE STAGGERED ON YOUR START. THE FASTEST CARS ARE UP FRONT. SLOWEST CARS ARE IN THE BACK. IF YOU DON'T QUALIFY, YOU'RE ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK. NOW, BECAUSE QUALIFYING FOR THE BIG RACE WHERE WE'RE RUNNING OUR SCOUT ISN'T UNTIL TOMORROW, THIS GIVES ME A CHANCE TO OBSERVE BRIAN AND SEE HOW HE TACKLES THE COURSE. ROCK AND ROLL, MAN. BUT I'M NOT HERE JUST TO WATCH. I ALSO HAVE A JOB TO DO. IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE'S SO MUCH GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD, OBVIOUSLY BEING STRESSED AS A DRIVER, AND YOU'RE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO KEEP THE CAR IN A FAST LINE. AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU'RE ON RACE COURSE, SO YOU GOT A CO-DRIVER THERE TELLING YOU, "OKAY, YOU HAVE A RIGHT-HAND TURN COMING UP. YOU HAVE A LEFT-HAND TURN COMING UP." YABBA-DABBA-DOO. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF WATCHING ALL THE GAUGES. SO IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE CAR -- IF YOU'RE STARTING TO GET HOT, IF YOUR TRANSMISSION'S STARTING TO GET HOT, IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO LET YOU KNOW, "HEY, YOU GOT TO BACK OUT OF IT, OR YOU'RE GONNA BURN THE CAR DOWN." CAR'S GOOD. VOLTAGE GOOD. OIL PRESSURE GOOD. TRANS GOOD. WATER TEMPERATURE'S FINE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S KILL IT. YOU READY? Man: 4876. WHEN I GIVE THE GO-AHEAD, I WILL RAISE THE FLAG. WHEN I DROP THE FLAG, YOU CAN GO, ALL RIGHT? FOUR HIGH, FRONT AND BACK? TRANSFER CASE IN? YEP. ALL RIGHT. MAKE IT SMOOTH. COME ON, DRIVER. YOU GOT IT. GOOD THROTTLE. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. QUARTER ON THROTTLE. YOU GOT IT. OH, COME ON. RIDE THAT WALL. GET IN THERE. TUCK -- TUCK INTO THE CORNER ON THIS ONE. YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE GOOD. ROTATE. ON THROTTLE! NO! ON THROTTLE! ON THROTTLE! ON THROTTLE! ON THROTTLE! THAT'S GOOD! GO! YOU GOT IT! COMING UP ON ROCKS. BACK DOWN TO ONE. YOU GOT IT? YEP. ALL RIGHT. GOOD LINE. GOOD LINE. GOOD LINE, DRIVER. GOOD LINE. GO LEFT. GO LEFT. THERE YOU GO. THAT'S THE ONE. THAT'S THE ONE. WE WERE HOT ON IT. WE WEREN'T GONNA BE THE FASTEST FINISHER, BUT IT WAS FAST. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. BLASTED UP THE LITTLE MOUNTAIN, AND THEN WE COME DOWN THE OTHER SIDE. RIGHT PASS. WHOA! BIG ROCK! AND THEN WE RAN INTO A ROCK ABOUT THE SIZE OF A JEEP, I THINK. WHAT THE ON THROTTLE! ON THROTTLE! WE GOT A FLAT. HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE? IT'S TIME TO GO FIND OUT WHAT THE TRUCK CAN DO. THIS THING. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DRIVE ANYTHING UP THAT. I'M THINKING THIS IS THE END OF THE ROAD. - I THINK THIS -- OH - THIS IS WHOA. Kaufman: COME ON, DRIVER. Kaufman: SO, DEEP IN OUR QUALIFYING LAP, I'M CO-DRIVING, AND WE WERE HOT ON IT. THAT'S THE ONE. THAT'S THE ONE. IT WAS TIME TO GO DOWN THE HILL, AND WHEN WE DID, WE TOOK A BAD HOP. AND THE BAD HOP POINTED THE CAR IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, AND TRY AS YOU MIGHT, THE CAR ENDED UP IN A ROCK. WHOA! BIG ROCK! SAW THAT ONE. WE COULDN'T DRIVE THROUGH THE ROCK, SO WE HAD TO STOP, PUT IT IN REVERSE... WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD. LET'S DRIVE. ...PUT IT IN DRIVE, AND GO FORWARD. ON THROTTLE! ON THROTTLE! RIGHT SIDE. EASY. WE'RE LANDING ON RIMS. WE GOT A FLAT, I THINK. LET'S BRING IT DOWN. LET'S SAVE THE EQUIPMENT. ALL RIGHT, WE PUSHED PRETTY GOOD. WHAT A BUMMER, YOU KNOW, COMING OUT OF THE GATE HOT, ON A FAST LAP, AND THEN WE TAKE ONE WRONG HOP. WELL, IT WASN'T SO MUCH WE HIT THE ROCK AS SOMEONE LEFT THAT ROCK IN THE WRONG SPOT. WE HAD A NICE LINE. THERE WAS JUST A BIG ROCK IN THE WAY. WE RAN 2:31 ON THREE TIRES AND WE GOT BUMPED ON OUR LINE AND WE HIT A BIG ROCK AND STILL PUT DOWN -- I THINK IT WAS A DECENT TIME. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A TOP-10, -15 HAD WE NOT HAD A MISTAKE. BUT THEY HAPPEN. WE'RE GONNA PULL UP HERE. WE'LL CHANGE THE TIRE REAL QUICK, AND THEN WE CAN GET IT IN AND KIND OF GO OVER. Kaufman: LUCKILY, WE DIDN'T DESTROY THE WHEEL, BUT THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS PLACE IS THAT IT'S HARD. PARDON ME. I'M LOOKING FOR A FELLA NAMED DAVE. HI, WELCOME TO KING OF THE HAMMERS, AARON. DAVE COLE -- MASTERMIND OF KING OF THE HAMMERS. HE IS THE GODFATHER OF THE HAMMERS. IT'S HIS BABY. IT'S HIS DEAL. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WAS JUST KIND OF A DUMB IDEA. DONE COMPETITION ROCK-CRAWLING STUFF, AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE COULD JUST DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WE NEEDED HORSEPOWER AND SPEED AND BAJA WAS DOING ITS THING, SO I JUST KIND OF MARRIED THE TWO TOGETHER -- JUST, LIKE, LONG-ENDURANCE DESERT RACING TO ROCK CRAWLING. WE DID A RACE, AND NO ONE KNEW ABOUT IT. WENT BACK AFTERWARDS AND SAID, "HEY, WHAT IF WE DID THIS RACE AND MADE THIS NEW KIND OF RACECAR?" AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF, AND THE INTERNET KIND OF SPUN OUT. IT WAS LIKE, "PEOPLE WILL DIE. IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. THIS IS THE DUMBEST IDEA IN THE WORLD. IT'S AWESOME." ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF OPINIONS. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY. I DIDN'T HAVE A PERMIT. DIDN'T HAVE ANY WAY TO DO IT. SO I STARTED GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM ALL THESE RACERS SAYING THEY WANTED TO COME RACE KING OF THE HAMMERS. YEAH. AND I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SPOTS LEFT. I TOOK THEIR CELL NUMBERS DOWN, TOOK THEIR PHONE NUMBERS DOWN, TOLD THEM I'D CALL THEM BACK. ONCE I HAD 50 PEOPLE, I CALLED THEM ALL UP AND SAID, "IF YOU GIVE ME $600 TOMORROW, YOU CAN HAVE THE LAST SPOT." OH, RIGHT! SO 50 GUYS GOT THE LAST SPOT. WE GOT OUR PERMITS, WE GOT OUR INSURANCE, AND WE WENT RACING. HOLY SMOKES, MAN. THAT'S HOW KING OF THE HAMMERS STARTED. HE BAMBOOZLED A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE INTO PAYING FOR THE VERY LAST SPOT, WHICH FUNDED A REAL RACE, AND THEN HERE WE ARE. 40,000 PEOPLE IN HAMMERTOWN AND SOMETHING LIKE 80,000 TOTAL PARTICIPANTS AND SPECTATORS ON RACE DAY. Cole: I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU FOR THE LONG TREK. TOMORROW MORNING, WE'RE MOVING QUALIFYING BACK TILL 10:00. WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP THE COURSE FROM 6:30 TO 8:30, JUST LIKE THIS MORNING. HOW DO YOU GUYS LIKE THE COURSE? - GOOD! ANYBODY COMPLAINING THAT IT'S TOO EASY? YEAH, FINISH LAP 2. TALK TO ME, BUBBA. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT. I TRULY APPRECIATE IT. YOU GUYS ARE BADASS. HELLO! HOW ARE YOU? I'M SO TIRED! THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I THINK EVERYONE IS. GOOD. GOOD. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. YEAH, HOW YOU DOING? HOW'S IT GOING? YOU ARE...? I'M CHRIS, HER CO-DRIVER. HE'S MY CO-DRIVER. EXCELLENT. AARON. THIS IS JASON, MY CO-DRIVER. HOW'S IT GOING, JASON? I'M JESSI. JESSI. NICE TO MEET YOU. - COMBS. - OH, SORRY. Woman: WHO IS JESSI COMBS? THE FIRST TIME I MET HER WAS AT STURGIS. SHE'S ACTUALLY FROM THE BLACK HILLS. SHE'S A HARD CHARGER, ESPECIALLY OUT HERE IN THE DESERT. SHE'S GOT A LONG HISTORY OF DESERT RACING, ROCK CRAWLING, SO THIS IS REALLY HER VENUE. AND SHE'S ALSO THE FASTEST WOMAN ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH. SHE'S GONE LIKE 600-SOME MILES AN HOUR. SO A VERY ACCOMPLISHED DRIVER AND A LOT OF FUN TO HANG OUT WITH. AND SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ELITE TALENT THAT KING OF THE HAMMERS DRAWS. PREVIOUS WINNERS INCLUDE ERIC MILLER, JASON SCHERER, AND SHANNON CAMPBELL. SO I'M IN SOME PRETTY SPECIAL COMPANY HERE. SO, I'M RIDING WITH BRIAN TILTON, AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD YEAR. TILTON. YEAH, CO-DRIVING. AND HE FINISHED LAST YEAR IN THE EXACT SAME CAR. YEAH, AND THEN SO, TODAY, I THINK WE'RE ON TRACK FOR A 2:08 QUALIFYING. WE LOST A TIRE, AND SO WE DID 2:31 ON THREE TIRES. I GOT FAITH IN HIM. I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO OKAY. AND THEN OUR TRUCK -- WHO KNOWS? WE'LL FIND OUT. I'D SAY IT WAS A PRETTY SUCCESSFUL FIRST DAY. BRIAN AND I QUALIFIED 40th OUT OF 110 4800 CARS. BUT TOMORROW WE'LL FINALLY TAKE THE SCOUT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR A SHORT TEST RUN BEFORE WE QUALIFY FOR THE BIG RACE. SO, THIS RIGHT HERE IS BRAND-SPANKING-NEW. WE'VE JUST NOW REALLY GOT THE TRUCK TOGETHER. WE'RE STILL BATTLING SOME TRANSMISSION STUFF. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THOUGH, IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THE TRUCK CAN DO. WE TALK ABOUT STAGES OF SUCCESS, AND THE FIRST PART -- GETTING HERE WAS A BIG ONE. THE NEXT WAS ACTUALLY ROLLING OUT AT PRACTICE. QUITE LITERALLY, THE FIRST TIME OUR '71 SCOUT HAS TOUCHED DIRT. JASON'S GONNA CO-DRIVE WITH ME. OUT OF ALL THE GUYS, I THINK JASON HAS THE MOST EXPERIENCE BUILDING A VARIETY OF CARS, THE MOST EXPERIENCE MECHANICAL, AND MOST EXPERIENCE OFF-ROAD, AND HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN HERE BEFORE. AND SO HOPEFULLY, THAT'S GONNA BE A BIG ADVANTAGE. ALL THESE TRUCKS LOOK LIKE SPACESHIPS. IT'S JUST COOL TO SEE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL TRUCK. THE SCOUT IS RACING IN A CLASS CALLED 4400, WHICH IS UNLIMITED. IT'S THE BIGGEST, BADDEST FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE RACECARS THERE ARE AND SOME OF THE NASTIEST, MEANEST, FASTEST DRIVERS. AND THEN THERE'S US. WE WERE ALREADY SET UP ON A LINE. WHEN I DECIDED WE WERE COMING TO KING OF THE HAMMERS BUT WE COULDN'T CHANGE THE SHOCK LOCATION -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT PUT US IN 4400. WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY BROUGHT A PAPERCLIP TO A GUN BATTLE, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GONNA TRY AND POKE SOME EYES OUT. ALL RIGHT, 25 ON THE SHORT COURSE. OKAY. OKAY, RUN THREE LAPS, AND WE GET ONE OFF THE TRACK, AND THEN I'LL GET YOU ON, ALL RIGHT? YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. THIS THING. ONCE WE GO UP THAT THING, WE'RE GONNA GO THE WHOLE TIME. OH, YEAH. I'M LOOKING UP THIS FIRST HILL, AND ALL I CAN THINK IS, "YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DRIVE ANYTHING UP THAT." AND WE JUST ROLLED UP TO IT. I SAID, "YOU GOOD?" "YEP." I WAS DRIVING ON THROTTLE. AND I SAID, "WE SLIDE THREE MORE FEET, WE'RE DONE." TURN, SET THIS THING DOWN. HOLY CRAP. OH, BIG ROCK. BUT THERES A GREAT, BIG ROCK LIKE THE SIZE OF A KIA. OH, WE FOUND IT! BACK UP. I'M THINKING, "THIS IS THE END OF THE ROAD." AND THAT TRUCK JUST KEEPS DIGGING AND PULLING. GO UP THIS THING, JUST CHUGGING ALONG. IT WAS LIKE THOMAS THE TRAIN, BUT IF IT WAS A SCOUT, YOU KNOW? I THINK I CAN. I THINK I CAN. COME ON, CAR. YOU GOT IT. LITTLE TRACTOR. - WE'RE GOOD. WE CLIMBED A HILL THAT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK A CAR COULD GO UP. YEAH! THAT LITTLE TRUCK, LIKE, TOTALLY KICKS ASS. WHOO-HOO! YEAH! AWESOME! NOW WE HAVE TO GO DOWN. I CAN'T SEE THE DROP. I CAN'T, EITHER. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT. WE'LL FIND IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WON'T WE? YEAH. GET OFF THE ROCK. COME ON. COME ON, CAR. FRONT TIRES HOP OFF THE LEDGE, GRAB THE NEXT LEDGE, TAKE ABOUT 2 1/2-, 3-FOOT FALL ON IT. AS LONG AS THEY'RE STAYING BOOST, IT DOES OKAY. DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. LET'S GO ANYWAY. AND THEN YOU'RE JUST COMMITTED. YOU GOT TO GO. AND SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE MOST DRIVING. LOOK WHERE I WANT TO GO, AND THEN GO THERE. YEAH! YEAH! BIG JUMP. BIG JUMP. THE PROBLEM IS HERE IS THERE'S GIANT ROCKS IN THE WAY. YEAH. ONE BEHIND YOU. WE'LL PROBABLY HEAR THAT A LOT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. OH, YEAH. BIG HOLE. WHOA! GOT ANOTHER ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE. YOU ALL RIGHT? THAT TOOK A DOWN. HOLY SO, DRIVING OUR SCOUT AT KING OF THE HAMMERS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON THE TRUCK WAS UNTESTED, UNPROVEN, AND UNADJUSTED. GONNA HURT. OH! YEAH. IT HATES THESE SHOCKS. GOT THE BEST SHOCKS ON PLANET EARTH. WHEN THEY'RE NOT SET UP YET, THEN THEY'RE JUST A STICK WITH FLUID INSIDE OF THEM. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THESE SHOCKS OFF THIS TRUCK. YEAH, YOU AIN'T KIDDING. ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER WITH THIS THING. GO, GO, GO, GO! HE'S TRYING TO TAKE YOU ON THE INSIDE. HE WANTS TO PLAY. HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE. LET'S GO! LET'S GO! Kaufman: SO, WE WERE TESTING OUT OUR SCOUT YESTERDAY. WE RAN INTO A COUPLE ISSUES, THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING OUR SUSPENSION NEEDED MAJOR TUNING. SO WE DECIDED TO SKIP QUALIFYING AND BRING IT HERE TO KING SHOCKS TO HAVE A SETUP DONE, SINCE WE FIGURED IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE A TRUCK THAT HANDLES WELL THAN A BETTER STARTING POSITION. Man: ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THAT A TRY? Kaufman: ALL RIGHT! OH, NO! WHAT HAPPENED? ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER WITH THIS THING. WE CAME OVER HERE TO KING. WE HAD TO MAKE A COUPLE FINAL ADJUSTMENTS. AND WE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS AN OIL LEAK. COME TO FIND OUT ONE OF THE OIL PRESSURE LINES THAT GOES TO THE TURBO HAS A LEAK. AND ALSO, ON TOP OF IT ALL, WE'RE NOT SURE IF OUR RACE PACK IS READING EXACTLY WHAT IT -- ZERO. BUT RIGHT NOW IT SAYS THERE'S 36% FUEL IN IT, WHICH THERE IS NOT. IT SUCKS 'CAUSE NOW WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIM AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, AND, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, WE ARE A TOUCH CONCERNED WITH FUEL. WHEN WE WERE OUT TESTING, IT WAS EATING SOME FUEL UP PRETTY BAD. AND IF WE HAD A 22-GALLON CELL, WE DIDN'T REALLY QUITE KNOW WHAT THE FUEL MILEAGE WAS 'CAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A TESTED VEHICLE. OH, THE FUEL? YOU WANT TO CHECK WHAT THE CALIBRATION IS? - I'M GONNA SAY ZERO. - OKAY. Kaufman: SO, WE HAVE TWO ISSUES WITH THE FUELING ON THE SCOUT. ONE IS THE FUEL CONSUMPTION SEEMS TO BE THROUGH THE ROOF. THE OTHER IS THE FUEL GAUGE IS COMPLETELY INACCURATE. - IT SAYS 100%. - WHAT IS IT? IT'S AT 100%? IT'S AT 100%. NOW, LUCKILY, I'M RUNNING THE 4800 RACE WITH BRIAN TOMORROW. SO THAT MEANS THE GUYS HAVE ABOUT 36 HOURS UNTIL THIS THING NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND RACE-READY. AS FOR ME, I HAVE TO MENTALLY PREP FOR THE 10-HOUR BEATING I'M GOING TO TAKE TOMORROW. Man: FANTASTIC DAY HERE IN HAMMERTOWN FOR THE SMITTYBILT EVERY MAN CHALLENGE. SUN IS SHINING. SKIES ARE BLUE. LET'S GET SOME RACING DONE. THIS IS PROBABLY A REALLY WEIRD WAY TO SIT. I'M JUST TRYING NEW THINGS OUT. VERY EXCITING, BRIAN. TODAY IS THE 4800 RACE. I'LL BE BRIAN TILTON'S CO-DRIVER ON THIS 10-HOUR, 136-MILE COURSE BEFORE I DRIVE THE FINAL 4400 RACE TOMORROW MORNING. Tilton: MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST PUT OUR HELMETS ON NOW. EVERYBODY ELSE IS. THE TIME OF IT'S 10 HOURS. AT 10 HOURS, THEY WRITE THREE LETTERS NEXT TO YOUR NAME -- DNF -- DID NOT FINISH. IT'S LIKE A SPECIAL KIND OF LOSER, YOU KNOW? WE DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY. YOU WANT ME TO SING YOU A SONG OR ANYTHING? I THINK I'M ALL RIGHT. Man: IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN, REMEMBER THIS IS THE PREDECESSOR TO THE BIG DADDY. - YEAH. - GET THIS DONE, BRIAN. YEP. IT'S GREAT TO WATCH AT THE END HOW EVERYBODY GOES -- WHOA! WE GOT A BICYCLE! WHOA, WAS THAT CONFUSING! WHAT THE HELL HAVE Y'ALL GOT GOING ON? WE HAVE A TRUCK ROLLED OVER, BUT I THINK THAT THEY CAN GET AROUND THE OUTSIDE. GO, GO, GO, GO! HARDER! HARDER! HE'S GONNA TRY AND TAKE YOU ON THE INSIDE. SHUT THE DOOR. SHUT THE DOOR! EASY ON THE BRAKES. YOU GOT HIM ON THE OUTSIDE. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. LOSE HIM! GO, GO, GO, GO! Kaufman: WE LEFT THE START LINE. WE PUSHED HARD. YOU GOT IT. I MEAN, WE PUSHED REALLY HARD AND WE DID REALLY GOOD AND THE CAR WAS WORKING REALLY WELL. THIS ZIG-ZAGS AROUND QUITE A BIT RIGHT HERE. RIDE IT LEFT. RIDE IT LEFT. BRIAN, IT GOES LEFT. THE GO-FAST STUFF I GET. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. YOU'RE DOING GOOD. YOU'RE DRIVING SMOOTH. CAR FEELS GOOD. THE ROCK STUFF IS SO NEW, YOU KNOW? YOU GOT IT NOW. YOU GOT IT. GOING OVER ROCKS THE SIZE OF REFRIGERATORS AND CARS... YOU GOT SOME MORE WIGGLE. AND A BIG TURN TO THE LEFT. LINES THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW BRIAN SEES THIS STUFF. BIG ROCK RIGHT SIDE. YOU'RE GOOD. YOU GOT A LEFT-HAND WIGGLE COMING UP. THERE IT IS. EASE IN IT. TAKE IT EASY. TAKE IT EASY. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ON 'EM. IF YOU WANT TO GET AWAY, WE CAN'T MAKE A PASS. LET'S DRIVE HIM HARD, SEE IF HE MAKES SOME MISTAKES IN THE NEXT ROCKS, OKAY? GOT TO PASS A RACER IN MILE THREE AND REALLY TURNED IT ON. WHEN WE GET OUT IN THIS FREE AIR, LET'S SCARE HIM A LITTLE BIT. AND SO WE GOT OUT THERE, AND WE WERE PICKING PEOPLE OFF. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. THE OTHER WAY. WELCOME TO THE BIG SHOW, DUDE! TAKE IT EASY NOW. WE'RE OUT IN FRONT. WHEN YOU'RE BEING HELD UP BY ANOTHER CAR... HE'S ON IT. HE'S ON IT. WE'RE ON. WE'RE ON. ...IT'S TOTALLY LEGAL TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BUMP JUST TO LET HIM KNOW YOU'RE THERE. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE IT FROM HIM. HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE IT TO US. YEAH! YEAH! COME ON! THANK YOU! LET'S GO! SO, AARON IS OUT RUNNING THE EMC TODAY WITH BRIAN. SO I'M PUTTING ON A COUPLE OF LITTLE DIFFERENTIAL SKID PLATES THAT CURRIE HOOKED US UP WITH. AND I'VE GOT TO DO SOME DRY FLANGES. I HAVE TO TAKE OUR OUTER DRIVE HUBS OFF, CHANGE THE OIL, YOU KNOW JUST GO THROUGH FLUIDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I HAVE TO GO THROUGH CONTINGENCY INSPECTION BETWEEN NOON AND 6:00. SO AT SOME POINT, I NEED TO GO OUT THERE AND GET OUR TRUCK LOOKED AT THE REST OF THE WAY. THERE YOU GO. PRESS IT! GO, GO, GO, GO, GO! ON COURSE! LEFT-HAND TURN. YOU CAN SEE IT. HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE IT TO US. HE WANTS HIS PLACE. CUT IT TIGHT. CUT IT TIGHT. GET ON HIM. HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE. HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE. YES, SIR! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THEY'RE JUST BUMPY AS HELL. SHOULDN'T HAVE ATE ALL THAT SPAGHETTI THIS MORNING. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GET INTO LOW RANGE RIGHT HERE. OKAY. BY THE TIME WE GOT TO COUGAR VIEW, WE HAD WORN OUT THE SHOCKS A LITTLE BIT, BOBBING OUT HARD. LET'S GO. Tilton: COME ON. KIND OF SWAMPING OUT ON BIG G-OUTS A LITTLE BIT, BUT STILL CHARGING QUICKLY. YEAH, SOMETHING IS PISSED OFF. I THINK WE'RE LOSING THE REAR SHOCKS. YEAH. WE ALREADY SMOKED THE SHOCKS ON THEM. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR THE WAY BYPASSES DO. 4876 COMING IN. 4876 COMING IN. LOOK ALIVE. RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE. COME ON, GUYS. GAS CAN. GOOD. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. HEY, JOSH, WE DON'T HAVE SHOCKS. FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM. SHOCKS ALTOGETHER, OR THIS RIGHT SIDE? NO, NO. BOTH OF THEM. WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE CAR ANYMORE. NO BROOKS, BIG CRESCENT WRENCH BACK IN THE TOOLBOX. TOP-BACK. BLACK RIGHT THERE. HE'S SAYING THEY LOST THE FRONT SHOCKS. THEY'RE REBOUNDING REALLY HARD, MEANING THAT THE FLUID INSIDE OF THEM -- THERE'S NO, LIKE, REBOUND TO THEM. THEY'RE NOT BEING HELD BACK. THERE'S NO DAMPENING. SO THE CAR'S JUST REBOUNDING. THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OF THE FRONT END. THE SHOCKS ARE GONE. HOW MUCH GAS DID IT TAKE? THEY PUT 10 IN, I HEARD THEM SAY. IT'LL BE FINE. IT'S HELD TOGETHER MECHANICALLY, BUT AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL FUNCTION AND TIP-TOP SHAPE, THEY'RE NOT WORKING THAT GREAT, SO... - YOU'RE ALL CLEAR. - CLEAR. YOU'RE GOOD. DOING GOOD. MILE 83. 40 MORE TO GO. CURVE AROUND RIGHT. THEN MAKE A LEFT CURVE UP HERE. YOU GOT TRAFFIC SITTING UP HERE. WE'RE JUST DOING THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT. SEE ANYTHING OVER THERE? NO. SMOOTH ROCK ON THIS ONE YOU'RE DROPPING OFF OF. THERE'S A SHARP ONE THAT'S ABOUT TWO FOOT OFF THE TIRE. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS, MAN. YEAH. BIG BOOM. I WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER LINE. I GOT IT. HEY, WE GOT PROBLEMS. HOW STUCK AM I? YEP. HEY! WE JUST PASSED AN ULTRA4 CAR, DUDE! WE HAD THE ACCELERATOR GLUED TO THE FLOOR. WE'RE ON FIRE. IT'S ON-FIRE ON FIRE. YOU THINK SO? YEAH, DUDE. Kamiryn: WE'RE WAITING FOR BRIAN AND AARON TO COME BACK. THEIR LAST PIT. AND I'M A LITTLE WORRIED BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM YET. I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE. IT'S A LITTLE NERVE-RACKING. WE HAD ONE BAD RIDE TODAY. SO THAT SCARES ME THAT THEY'RE NOT BACK YET. ALSO SCARY. YEAH. HEY, JUST GOT WORD THAT THEY'RE MOVING AGAIN RIGHT NOW. COURSE CLOSES AT 5:30 OVER HERE, SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY MAKE IT BACK. DO YOU HAVE A SPEED, PERHAPS, ON THEM? I'M TRYING TO TEXT, BUT I'M NOT GETTING TOO GOOD RECEPTION. Woman: 1.9 miles per hour. 1.9. I MEAN, THEY COULD BE IN ROCKS. Tilton: HEY! GRAB THE WINCH. Kaufman: OUT HERE, IT'S HELL, YOU KNOW? IT'S SUPER-SUPER HARD. EVERYTHING'S HARD. MOVING EQUIPMENT'S HARD. IT'S HARD ON YOUR BODY. IT'S HARD ON YOUR MIND. IT'S HARD ON YOUR TEAM. IT'S HARD ON YOUR EQUIPMENT. IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING HERE IS TRYING TO KILL IT. MY JOB DOESN'T END AT JUST NAVIGATING. IF THIS CAR GETS STUCK, I GOT TO SCRAMBLE UP THESE STUPID ROCKS. I GOT TO FIND A ROCK BIGGER THAN THE CAR. I GOT TO THROW A STRAP AROUND IT, HOOK A WINCH CABLE TO IT, TELL HIM. ALL RIGHT. WHOA! HE'S GONNA PULL THE CAR UP THERE. WE'RE UP. AND THEN HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 10 FEET LATER, YOU KNOW? YOU WANT ME TO WALK IT, OR DO YOU WANT TO...? I WANT YOU IN. HOLY THAT WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS. WHAT TIME IS IT? 5:20. 5:20? YEAH. YEAH, WE'RE GONNA MISS CUTOFF. 6:00 P.M.? NO, 5:30, OUT AT REMOTE PIT 2B. GREAT. YOU WANT TO JUST GET OUT OF HERE? LET'S JUST TRY AND FIND A BYPASS, HEAD BACK TO CAMP. YEAH, THAT'S WHERE THE COLD BEER'S AT, AND WE DON'T GET ANY POINTS FOR RUNNING THEM, ALL RIGHT? NOPE. BY RACE MILE 99, WE WERE TIMED OUT. THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL WAY FOR US TO ACTUALLY FINISH IN TIME. AND SO WE KNEW THERE WERE COLD BEER AND SANDWICHES BACK AT THE PLACE. AND SO WE DECIDED JUST GET ON HOME. Tilton: YOU SAW THE WHOLE RACE COURSE TODAY. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TALKING WITH YOUR GUYS ABOUT UP THERE. THERE AIN'T NOTHING LEFT OF THAT TRUCK. THEY'RE PRETTY NERVOUS. WE ARE SHORTER. WE ARE NOT AS WIDE. AND I DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE. SO IT IS GOING TO BE A SHOW. THAT PACE THAT WE RAN TODAY WAS A LITTLE BIT FASTER THAN WE RAN LAST YEAR... YEAH. ...BUT WE RAN THAT PACE ALL DAY WITH LITERALLY NO ISSUES, AND IT STILL TOOK US 13 HOURS TO FINISH. OH, MAN. WHOO, IS IT GONNA BE A LONG DAY TOMORROW. Man: WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TO HAMMER TOWN. IT IS THE 2018 NITTO KING OF THE HAMMERS, PRESENTED BY OPTIMUM BATTERIES. IT WILL BE A SPECTACULAR DAY OF RACING. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STARTING POSITIONS. THERE'S PEOPLE BEHIND ME, RIGHT? COOL. THE LAST 100 DAYS ALL BOILED DOWN TO THIS. IN THE NEXT 202 MILES, WE'LL FIND OUT IF THE SCOUT, MY TEAM, AND MYSELF CAN TACKLE THE KING OF THE HAMMERS. THE BIG GOAL IS TO HAVE THAT CAR GO ACROSS THE LINE IN UNDER THE TIME LIMIT. BUT I'VE HAD THREE PEOPLE LAUGH AT ME WHEN I SAID, "ALL I WANT TO DO IS FINISH." THEY SAID, "ALL ANYONE WANTS TO DO IS FINISH." Man #2: ALL AROUND THIS COURSE, WE HAVE FERRIES FOR BOTH PITS. SO IF THESE GUYS NEED FUEL, THEY CAN RECEIVE IT FROM THEIR CREW. Man: BUT IF YOU GET OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE, YOU WILL BE DISQUALIFIED. OKAY, ON THE LINE, WE'VE GOT AARON KAUFMAN. IT'S HIS FIRST TIME HERE AT KING OF THE HAMMERS. HE'S BEEN BUILDING THIS VEHICLE. THE MAIN THING EVERYBODY TELLS YOU OUT HERE IS HAVE FUN BECAUSE IT CAN BE SUPER-STRESSFUL. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINING THE STAGING. YOU'RE SITTING THERE IN THE TRUCK, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE HELP YOU GET PUMPED. ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT. I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO FIGURE THAT OUT QUICK 'CAUSE THIS IS GONNA BE A SHORT RIDE, JASON. I CAN'T SEE THE COURSE. Bowman: HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. OKAY. YOU'RE COMING UP ON A SWEEPING LEFT. TURN LEFT. TURN LEFT. AND A HARD RIGHT. STAY STRAIGHT. WE'RE AT 209 AND CLIMBING. I'M JUST BEATING THIS THING AND GOING NOWHERE. - OVER TEMP. - YEP. SEE IT. LET'S RUN IT TILL IT LOCKS. SOUNDS GOOD. THIS THE HILL CLIMB? I WISH I COULD SEE. YES, SIR. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I CAN'T SEE OH, THEY'RE WINCHING OVER THERE! ARE THESE PEOPLE DOING? I'M GOING RIGHT. I'M GOING RIGHT. GO RIGHT. GO RIGHT. WE HAD THE ACCELERATOR GLUED TO THE FLOOR JUST CHUGGING ALONG AS HARD AS THAT LITTLE BOOGER WOULD, YOU KNOW? I LIKE THE TRUCK, BUT THIS DRIVE LINE'S A PIECE OF HELL, YES. I YEAR YA. HEY, WE PASSED AN ULTRA4 CAR, DUDE! BIG ROCK. WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT. WE'RE ON THROTTLE, ON THROTTLE. COME ON! COME ON! SIXTH GEAR, MAYBE? NO? IT WON'T SHIFT. IF I LIFT OUT OF IT, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TROUBLE. OH I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S EVEN TRYING TO SPIN THE TIRES. NO. YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TAPE IN THE CAMERA. WHAT'S IT DOING? WE MAY BE IN HERE ALL DAY, JASON. UNCLASSIFIED, THIS IS A DEE-SASTER. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH. THIS WAS HANDS-DOWN, WITHOUT A DOUBT, 100% A FAILURE IN MY CHOICE OF MOTOR AND TRANSMISSION FOR THIS. WHOO! THESE E.T.s ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. WE'RE ON FIRE. HOLD ON. LET'S JUST AIR IT OUT. ALL RIGHT. IT'S ON-FIRE ON FIRE. YOU THINK SO? YEAH, I THINK. WE'RE HARD IN IT RIGHT NOW. IT STILL WON'T UP-SHIFT. THIS IS EVERYTHING WE GOT. THIS THING WAS GOING TO BURN TO THE GROUND, OR IT WAS GOING TO GO OVER THIS HILL. COME ON! IF IT'S GONNA BLOW UP, IT'S GONNA BLOW UP. RIGHT NOW WE'RE CURRENTLY IN AN INSANE DUST STORM. TURN TO YOUR LEFT A LITTLE BIT. I CAN'T LOOK UP. GREEN SCREEN WHEN WE GET BACK. I'VE GOT MY EYES CLOSED. Woman: YEAH. Man: LIKE, IS THERE SAND IN YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW? - ME? YEAH. - I DON'T THINK YOU CAN USE ANY OF THIS. OH, HEY. I'M FARTING, AND IT'S JUST BLOWING RIGHT IN YOUR FACES. I GUESS RAY CHARLES WOULD OUT OF THIS. SMELL IT? I DO. IT'S KIND OF LIKE... IT'S LIKE... Kaufman: WELL, WE GOT TO GET UP THIS HILL. IF WE CAN'T GET UP THIS HILL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A -- LISTEN, WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO CLIMB THEM ROCKS. YEAH. THIS THING WAS GOING TO BURN TO THE GROUND OR IT WAS GONNA GO OVER THIS HILL. THERE WERE ONLY TWO OPTIONS. WE'RE HARD IN IT RIGHT NOW. EVERYTHING SHE GOT. COME ON. Bowman: THERE WE GO. WE GOT IT. STILL WON'T UPSHIFT. THIS IS EVERY BIT WE GOT. THIS IS EVERYTHING WE GOT AT THE MOMENT. WE WERE SO DESTROYED ON THE MOTOR AND TRANSMISSION BY THE TIME WE GOT OVER THE SAND HILL AT RACE MILE 3. SO NOW, POP THAT OVER. GOOD. STRAIGHT UP. YEAH, MAN. IT'S RIGHT THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL. WELCOME TO PIT 1. FEELS GOOD TO GET TO PIT 1. YOU WANT TO STOP OR YOU WANT TO BLOW THROUGH? UH, IT. IF IT'S GONNA BLOW UP, IT'S GONNA BLOW UP, RIGHT? THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WAS THINKING. YEP. YOU KNOW, WE PASSED PIT 1, IT WAS LIKE -- LIKE WE'RE THE SLOWEST, MOST BADASS MFs ON THIS TRACK. IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. A LEFT TURN, LOOKS LIKE IT. LET'S GO. AARON AND JASON JUST DROVE BY, SEEMED IN GOOD SPIRITS, HONKED THE HORN, GAVE US A NICE LITTLE WAVE. IT WAS GOOD, A LITTLE BIT SLOWER, BUT THEY'RE MAKING IT THROUGH AND THEY JUST WANT TO FINISH, AND I THINK THEY'RE GONNA FINISH. - MAIN PIT'S NEXT, ISN'T IT? - NO. WE GO BACK THROUGH 1 AFTER COUGAR'S BUTTE, WHICH IS LIKE SOME REAL ROCK CRAWLING. YEP. AND THEN A LOT OF HIGH-SPEED STUFF, BUT NOT FOR US. BUT ANYWAY, UH... I HAD THAT THING GLUED TO THE FLOOR, AT A WHOPPING, BLISTERING 30 MILES AN HOUR. Bowman: WE ARE WIDE OPEN. BURNIN' THAT FUEL. Kaufman: JUST BLACK SMOKE EVERYWHERE. NO HUH? SO, THE BLACK SMOKE IS A BY-PRODUCT OF FUEL, AND MORE FUEL TYPICALLY EQUALS MORE SMOKE. THE SMOKE, ON THROTTLE, WHILE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE ROAD, NO, THAT'S NOT COMMON. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT. NOPE. NO FUEL PRESSURE. NO PRESSURE. PICK IT UP. CAN'T GO FORWARD, CAN'T GO BACK. OUT OF FUEL. YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT, MYSELF. AT THE POINT THAT WE RAN OUT OF FUEL, WE WERE 36 MILES FROM MAIN PIT, WE WERE 26.5 MILES BACK FROM OUR PIT. THERE WAS NO WAY ON THIS PLANET TO GET FUEL INTO THAT TRUCK LEGALLY UNDER RACE CONDITIONS. AND SO, THE RUNNING OUT OF FUEL, EFFECTIVELY, WAS THE END OF THE RACE. - WHERE THEY AT? - AT AROUND 26, YOU SAID? THEY'RE IN BETWEEN 26 AND 27, RAN OUT OF GAS. - OKAY, I'LL LET 'EM KNOW. - THANKS SO MUCH. SO, THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO IS MAYBE JUST GET EYES ON-SCENE. YEAH. HOPEFULLY THEY'LL USE THAT CAMERA. Kaufman: AS WE FIND OUR STRANDED MOTORIST LOST, DISMAYED, AN EMOTIONAL WRECK, WE SEE HIS FACULTIES BREAK DOWN. HE BEGINS TO WONDER, "WHERE AM I? HOW DO I FIND FOOD? WHERE AM I REALLY AT ON THE FOOD CHAIN?" ALL THESE WILL BE ANSWERED NEXT ON "SHIFTING GEARS." SO, IT'S BEEN 6 MINUTES AND I'M STARTING TO GET NERVOUS THAT THEY WON'T FIND US. WE'RE EITHER GONNA HAVE TO DIG A HOLE IN THE GROUND TO ESCAPE THE BLISTERING SUN AND CUT OPEN A CACTUS FOR WATER OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE -- I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN... FLY ON OUT OF HERE. HEY, BOYS. ARE YOU ALL WITH TRIPLE "A" OR WHAT? YES, SIR. WE KNOW. WHEN YOU GUYS CAME THROUGH AND YOU WERE HONKING THAT HORN... UH-HUH. ...I WAS ALL EXCITED. I FELT LIKE YOU GUYS WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS AND EVERYTHING. OH, WE WERE IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS. THE TRUCK MAY NOT HAVE BEEN. BRINGING DIESEL FOR YOU AND A TRAILER. HOPEFULLY TRY TO GET YOU OUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND THEN WE CAN TRAIL YOU BACK ONCE WE GET TO THE MAIN ROAD. WE'RE DRIVING THIS BITCH UNTIL IT LIGHTS ON FIRE. THE THING WITH THEM BRINGING US OUT FUEL IS, IT DISQUALIFIES US FOR THE RACE. SO, ESSENTIALLY, OUR DAY WAS DONE. Kaufman: WE'D MEASURED THE FUEL AFTER SHOCK TUNING AND APPEARED WE WERE GETTING A MILE A GALLON AND WE JUST THOUGHT, "IT CAN'T BE RIGHT. MAYBE WE'RE GUESSTIMATING THE MILEAGE WRONG." NO, IT GETS ONE MILE A GALLON. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE FUEL'S GOING IN THIS CAR. OUT THE TAILPIPE. IT'S IN THE FORM OF BLACK SMOKE. RIGHT. WHO KNOWS, HAD WE HAD FUEL, WE MAYBE COULD'VE MADE IT ANOTHER 10 MILES BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY GAVE UP. THAT TRANSMISSION IS SMOKED. 28 PEOPLE FINISHED THE RACE. THERE'S 102 CARS THAT STARTED. EIGHT PEOPLE WERE BELOW US IN THE LIST. THAT'S PRETTY DAMN COOL, YOU KNOW? WE HAVEN'T BUILT ONE OF THESE CARS BEFORE. NOT A BAD WAY TO CUT YOUR TEETH AT KING OF THE HAMMERS. ALL RIGHT, SIR. HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN? NAP TIME IS OVER. OOH, WE'RE GONNA DO SOME WORK? HERE. Kaufman: THIS WAS SO MUCH FUN. IT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED IT TO BE, ALMOST. I WOULD'VE LIKE TO HAVE GONE FASTER. I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE GONE FURTHER. BUT YOU GOT TO EARN YOUR STRIPES, YOU GOT TO CUT YOUR TEETH, AND WE DID BOTH THOSE THINGS. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING END TO OUR FIRST CHAPTER AT THE GARAGE. I'M PROUD OF MY CREW, I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED TOGETHER IN BUILDING THE SCOUT. WE WANTED TO SEE IF WE COULD BUILD IT, AND THEN WE WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS MADE OF. AND, YOU KNOW, THE RACE DIDN'T BREAK US. IT MIGHT HAVE BROKE OUR TRUCK. AND NOW, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK TO THE GARAGE AND TACKLING MY NEXT BUILD.
