 I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HANDPICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL, AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST.

 I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS TONIGHT... I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO SUCK. YOU JUST NEED TO SUCK LESS THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. - RIGHT? ...WE'LL SEE IF MY SEMI RACECAR WILL STAND UP AGAINST THE PROFESSIONALS... LIGHT THEM FIRES, ROLLING TIRES. ...SOME OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS TRUCK'S CAPABLE OF. AND WITH NO TEST TIME... - YES! ...THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE TO SEE HOW MY SEMI TRUCK WILL PERFORM. I'VE GOT A MALFUNCTION LIGHT.

 AH, WE GOT A CODE POPPED UP ON HIS TRUCK. BETWEEN THE SIZE AND SPEED AND THE COMPETITION... -GO, GO! ...I MIGHT BE IN OVER MY HEAD. WE ALL KNOW THAT SIDEWAYS ISN'T THE FASTEST WAY AROUND THE TRACK, BUT IT MIGHT BE THE FASTEST WAY TO FUN TOWN! - OH! - OH! WELCOME PIKES PEAK INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY, BETTER KNOWN AS PPIR. WE'RE HERE TO TEST OUR NEWLY BUILT SEMI AGAINST FIVE OF THE COUNTRY'S BEST BIG-RIG TRUCKS AND DRIVERS. WE'RE COMPETING ON FOUR DIFFERENT COURSES. THE DRAG STRIP -- IT'S AN EIGHT-MILE-LONG COURSE WHERE WE MEASURE THE SPEED OUR TRUCK'S ABLE TO ATTAIN. THE 1/4 MILE OVAL -- A RACE THAT PUSHES THE DRIVER'S SKILL TO GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN WITHOUT LOSING SPEED THROUGH THE TURN. THE ROAD COURSE -- FULL OF TWISTS AND TURNS. AND FINALLY, THE FREESTYLE COMPETITION. THE GOAL? GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN WITHOUT DESTROY YOUR RIG OR LOSING CONTROL. FOR ME, TO SEE IF WE'VE BUILT A SEMI RACECAR THAT CAN REALLY PREFORM. I'VE ONLY DONE THIS ONCE BEFORE, BUT THESE GUYS? THEY DO IT EVERY WEEKEND. SO, THIS COULD GO GOOD, OR THIS COULD BE A REALLY GREAT JOKE. THE DRIVERS HERE TODAY ARE ALL TOP COMPETITORS, AND MANY OF THEM HOLD NATIONAL TITLES. BUT WITH NO LUCRATIVE ENDORSEMENT DEALS LIKE NASCAR OR FORMULA ONE, SEMI TRUCK RACING IS A WORKING MAN'S COMPETITION. MOST OF THESE DRIVERS HAUL LOADS DURING THE WEEK, AND RACE ON THE WEEKENDS. PLACING IN A RACE CAN MEAN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PRIZE MONEY. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THEY SHOW UP TO WIN. THESE GUYS ARE WELL EXPERIENCED, TO SAY THE LEAST, AND WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN THIS VERSUS MINE, WELL, I'D SAY I AM GREATLY OUTMATCHED. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT BOOGER OUT THERE, MAN. THAT IS AN OLD STERLING TRUCK. SO, WE'VE TAKEN AN '01 STERLING OVER THE RHODES SEMI TRUCK. AND WITH THE HELP OF MY FRIEND BOB BALL, ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING DIESEL MECHANICS, DOUBLED THE HORSEPOWER AND TURNED IT INTO A RACECAR. THIS REALLY SHOULD BE ABOUT 900 HORSEPOWER, SOMEWHERE IN THE BALLPARK OF 2,200-FOOT POUNDS OF TORQUE. THE VEHICLE NEVER REALLY PRESENTED ANY MAJOR ISSUES OTHER THAN ITS SHEER SIZE. SOME ASPECTS OF THE DRIVELINE BRAKING SUSPENSION ARE JUST BIGGER THAN WHAT WE HAD, SO WE HAD TO BUY A FEW THINGS AND BUY MORE OF IT, AND BY THAT I MEAN TUBING -- LOTS AND LOTS OF TUBING. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE, YOU FILTHY ANIMAL. THE DOOR OPENINGS ARE BIGGER, IT'S WIDER ACROSS THE CAB, THE STICK'S BEHIND THE CAGE, DOWN THE SIDE OF IT. WE HAVE TO DO THINGS TO IT THAT WE DON'T NORMALLY DO, LIKE ADD THE -- WE'LL CALL THEM "SIDE PODS," AND THEY'RE THE BIG BOXES FROM EITHER SIZE OF THE FRAME. CAB INTRUSION IS A SERIOUS TREAT ON THE RACE COURSE, SO WE'VE PUT THE SIDE PODS ON THE TRUCK TO PROTECT EVERYTHING AROUND THE CAR, INCLUDING THE DRIVER. THE LAST 40 HOURS OF THIS BUILD DIDN'T HAPPEN OVER ONE WEEK, IT HAPPENED OVER A DAY, YOU KNOW, A DAY-AND-A-HALF, ALMOST TWO DAYS. WE PACKED EVERYTHING TOGETHER, SLAMMED EVERYTHING IN THERE, GOT THIS TRUCK LOADED AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING. WE BROUGHT IT UP HERE, AND WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IF IT CAN COMPETE WITH SOME OF THE FASTEST RIGS IN THE COUNTRY. MY NAME IS CHRIS KIKELHAN, AND I OWN SUNDANCE MOTORSPORTS. I'VE BEEN RACING TRUCKS FOR THREE YEARS NOW. I KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FLAIR ON EVERYTHING THAT I DO, AND I WANT PEOPLE TO KIND OF REMEMBER ME WHEN I'M OUT THERE. I DON'T DRIVE THIS TRUCK TOO OFTEN. I JUST WRECKED ONE PRETTY BAD IN DOING, LIKE, SOME TESTING. I HIT A WALL AT 70 MILES AN HOUR. THE CAB FELL OFF, AND I BROKE MY ARM AND STUFF, SO -- I STILL HAVE A BROKEN HAND RIGHT NOW. BUT I'LL GET THROUGH IT, I GUESS. MY NAME'S JUSTIN BALL. I DRIVE THE NUMBER 17 PETERBILT FOR JUPITER MOTORSPORTS. LAST TIME I RACED WITH AARON, HE KIND OF LOST THE BACK END OF THE TRUCK, AND HIS TRUCK SLID DOWN AND WE KIND OF MET THERE IN THE MIDDLE. I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS TIME. MY NAME'S ALLEN BOLES, AND I DRIVE THE NUMBER 3 TRUCK FOR JUPITER MOTORSPORTS. I'VE BEEN RACING TRUCKS SINCE 1993. I'VE DRAG RACED THEM, I'VE CIRCLE TRACK RACED THEM, ROAD COURSE RACED AND EVERYTHING, WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF ALL KIND OF RACING AND BIG TRUCKS. JOEY SEAMAN, I RACE FOR MYSELF. WHEN I WAS 16, I STARTED DRAG RACING. MY PARENT'S ALL THREE OF US DRIVE. WE'VE ALL BEEN DRAG RACING FOR A WHILE. YEAH. I BROUGHT ANOTHER SET OF TIRES. I PLAN ON BLOWING THEM. MY NAME IS TOMMY BOILEAU, AND I DRIVE FOR CAESARS TRUCK RACING. I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GROW UP IN A RACING FAMILY, SO MY MOM AND DAD ACTUALLY MET AT A RACETRACK WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE KIDS. BOTH OF THEIR FATHERS WERE RACING, SO I'M THIRD GENERATION ON BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY. I'M ACTUALLY THE CHIEF DRIVING INSTRUCTOR HERE AT THE TRACK NOW. I'VE GOT MORE LAPS AROUND THIS PLACE THAN ANYBODY, WHICH DEFINITELY PLAYS TO MY ADVANTAGE. WE'RE OUT HERE SLINGING BIG TRUCKS AROUND. THE ADRENALINE'S HIGH, AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. OUTRIGHT BATTLE ROYAL, I THINK. HEY, I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING OUT TO PPIR. I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE DOING SOME TESTING BEFORE THE FIRST ROUND OF THE SERIES THIS YEAR. AARON DECIDED TO COME JOIN US, AND HE'S GOT A BRAND-NEW TRUCK, AND HE WANTED TO SEE HOW HE COMPARES TO THE BIG BOYS. I'M BOB BOILEAU, AND "BOILEAU" LIKE "GIRL HIGH, BOY LOW." WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COMPETITION ON THE DRAG STRIP, AND THIS IS ALL TIMED WITH LASER BEAMS, SO THERE'S NO FUDGING IT. AARON AND I MET AT PIKES PEAK A FEW YEARS AGO, AND WE'VE STAYED IN TOUCH. WHEN HE TOLD ME HE WAS BUILDING A BIG TRUCK, I SAID, WELL, I HAVE A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PLAY WITH A BIG TRUCK. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER COMPETITION OUT HERE ON THE 1/4 MILE OVAL, AND YOU'RE EACH GONNA GET EIGHT LAPS AROUND THE 1/4 MILE OVAL. ANOTHER COMPETITION WE'RE GONNA DO -- WE'RE GONNA SET UP A ROAD COURSE, 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU GUYS LIKE TURNING LEFT A LOT, BUT WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU TURN LEFT AND RIGHT. SO, THE GUYS I'M MEETING UP HERE -- THEY'RE ALL BIG-RIG RACERS, AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR SEASONS OPENER COMING UP IN TWO WEEKS IN ALABAMA, AND SO THEY'RE OUT HERE SHAKING THEIR TRUCKS DOWN MAKING SURE THEY'RE READY, AND THESE GUYS PLAY HARD, SO THEY DEFINITELY HAVE SOME THINGS TO SHAKE OUT. I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE DIFFERENT SET-UPS ON YOUR TRUCKS AND YOU'RE HERE TESTING BEFORE THE SEASONS STARTS. AND OF COURSE AARON'S GONNA THROW SOME WRENCHES IN IT TO SEE WHAT HE CAN COME UP WITH, SO THAT WILL BE FUN TO SEE HOW HIS TRUCK COMPARES. GUYS, I -- I'M SUPER EXCITED. SO, Y'ALL'S TRUCKS ARE SORTED, Y'ALL HAVE WORKED -- I MEAN, YOU'VE ALL BEEN RACING THESE THINGS AND A COUPLE OF THESE TRUCKS AND DRIVERS ARE REAL FAST. MINE'S BEEN A TRUCK FOR ABOUT A DAY NOW, SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THINGS SHAKE OUT. I APPRECIATE Y'ALL LETTING ME SLIDE IN ON TESTING. ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT YOU GOT, AARON. YEAH, WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH. - OH, YEAH. - ALL RIGHT. SO, OUR COMPETITION BEGINS WITH AN EIGHTH-MILE DRAG RACE. IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS ANY DRAG RACING EVENT YOU'VE EVER SEEN, ONLY OUR TRUCKS WEIGH FIVE TIMES AS MUCH. THE DRAG RACE IS GOING TO TEST OUR SEMI'S POWER AND GRIP AS WELL AS MY ABILITY TO SHIFT. SO, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE POWER LEVELS, REALLY, WHAT HAVE WE CHANGED? WELL, WE GOT A BOB BALL CALIBRATION IN OUR COMPUTER. WE PUT ON A BULLY DOG TURBO, AND WE'VE PUT IN SOME FANCY INJECTORS FROM DETROIT. THIS REALLY SHOULD BE ABOUT 900 HORSEPOWER, 2,200-FOOT POUNDS OF TORQUE. TO GET ALL THAT POWER TO THE GROUND, WE CHOSE A SET OF CONTINENTAL TIRES, WHICH, TO PUT IT SIMPLY, ARE WIDER, HAVE A BIGGER CONTACT PATCH, AND A SPECIFIC TREAD TO GET AS MUCH TIRE ON THE GROUND AS POSSIBLE. WE'LL SEE IF ALL THOSE UPGRADES PAY OFF. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS. IT'S TIME TO GET THIS PARTY STARTED. CHRIS, YOU'RE FIRST. YOU READY? - YEP. OBVIOUSLY, THE WINNER. - ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD AND LET'S GET THE GREEN FLAG. - WHOO! - WHOO! - 9.9! - 9.935. PRETTY GOOD. I HAD TO TAKE THE FIRST ROUND, RAN ABOUT A 9.9. I'M PRETTY PROUD OF IT. - HE THREW DOWN ON THAT ONE. JUSTIN, YOU READY? - YEAH. - LET'S DO IT. HEY, LIGHT THEM FIRES, ROLL THEM TIRES. GOING SECOND, I THINK THAT WAS ALL RIGHT FOR US -- PRETTY MUCH JUST WENT AT IT WITH, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT OUR BEST SHOT AND SEE HOW IT WENT. ALL RIGHT, SEND HIM. WHOO! A NEW COURSE RECORD! JUST LIKE THAT! - YEAH! - JUST LIKE THAT! GOT DOWN INTO A 9.7 -- WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER HAD WE NOT LAGGED OFF THE LINE, BUT IT WASN'T HORRIBLE. - ALLEN. - LET'S GO, BUDDY. - THEY SET THE BAR. - 9.74 IS THE TIME TO BEAT. SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE, ALLEN. - ALL RIGHT. ALLEN "TURBO" BOLES -- HE'S BEEN RACING SEMIS FOR 30 YEARS. THE GUY'S A LEGEND. HE'S WON 2 NATIONAL DRAG RACES, AND HE'S GOT AT LEAST 200 RUNS UNDER HIS BELT. SEND HIM, BRADY. SO, OF COURSE HE PUT DOWN THE FASTEST TIME YET -- 8.67. 8.67 -- THAT'S THE NEW TIME TO BEAT. THEN IT WAS JOEY "THE DRAG RACER'S" TURN. - WHAT'S YOUR TIME GONNA BE? - I THINK I'LL MATCH IT. HE'S YOUNG, BUT ALREADY TEARING IT UP ON THE CIRCUIT, HAVING COMPLETED IN TWO NATIONAL DRAG RACING EVENTS. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, SEND HIM. HE DIDN'T QUITE MATCH ALLEN'S TIME. 8.99. HE DID DO AN IMPRESSIVE 8.99. TOMMY. 8.67'S STILL THE TIME TO BEAT. AND THEN TOMMY WAS UP. TOMMY HAS RACECAR DRIVING IN HIS DNA. HE'S GOT TOO MANY WINS TO MENTION. THIS DUDE CAN DRIVE. HE DROVE A NEW TRUCK TODAY, AND STILL PUT DOWN A RESPECTABLE 9.22. - I'M IMPRESSED! - YEAH! WELL, I GUESS THAT MAKES IT MY TURN. - HEY, 8.6. - YEAH. WELL, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN BRING HOME. - ALL RIGHT. - COME ON, AARON. SO, WHEN IT COMES TO DRAG RACE, THERE'S NO CAR CONTROL, THERE'S NOTHING OTHER THAN GO, SO IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO HOW MUCH POWER DO I MAKE, HOW WELL CAN I PUT IT ON THE GROUND, AND HOW WELL CAN I SHIFT THIS THING? - BOB, WHAT'S AARON GONNA RUN? - OOF. 10.7? 10.8? I THINK HE'LL BE SOMEWHERE IN THE -- IN THE 10s. SO, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHAT THIS TRUCK CAN DO WITH SOME CONFIDENCE. IT MAKES A LOT OF POWER. BUT IT DOES WEIGH A WHOLE LOT, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT. WE'LL FIND OUT. HE SAID HE'S GONNA TRY AND DO A BURNOUT. - LOOK AT THIS. CHILL! - WEAR OUT THEM BRAND-NEW TIRES. - HE STALLING? - HE KILLED IT. - IT DIED? - NO, NO, NO.. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS. WE'RE GONNA BE RACING ON THE 1/4 MILE OVAL. THE FIRST COUPLE LAPS I TRIED TO GET IT AS FAST AS I COULD, AND THEN AFTER THAT JUST SIDEWAYS. THERE GOES THE CAMERAS. - OH! - OH! DON'T HIT THE CAMERAS, DON'T HIT THE CAMERAS! BOB, WHAT'S AARON GONNA RUN? OOF. 10.7? 10.8? HE NEEDS TO BEAT AN 8.6 IF HE WANTS TO TAKE THE LEAD. SO, WE'RE HERE AT PIKES PEAK INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY TESTING OUR NEWLY BUILT SEMI. WE'RE CURRENTLY RUNNING A DRAG RACE WHERE THE OTHER FIVE DRIVERS HAVE ALREADY GONE WITH ALLEN BOLES LAYING DOWN THE CURRENT FASTEST TIME OF 8.67 SECONDS. HE SAID HE'S GONNA TRY AND DO A BURNOUT. OOH, HE'S GOT IT. - CHILL! - WEAR OUT THEM BRAND-NEW TIRES! - HE STALLING? - HE KILLED IT. - IT DIED? - NO, NO, NO.. I'M EXCITED TO FINALLY PUT ALL THESE ENGINE UPGRADES WE DID TO USE IN MY FIRST-EVER SEMI DRAG RACE, AND OF COURSE I MANAGE TO STALL THE TRUCK. ALL RIGHT, IT'S STALLED AND THE BLINKER'S ON. WE JUST NEED TO SEE THE WIPERS, AND HE'S GONNA HAVE IT ALL. AND THAT WAS KIND OF A -- YOU KNOW, TOOK A NOSEDIVE, SO THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A BUMMER. WE'RE GOOD. DRAG RACING OUR SEMI TRUCK IS NOT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE YOU DRAG RACE. YOU'RE INCREDIBLY HIGH UP, AND YOU'RE MOVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WEIGHT, AND YOU BUILD POWER DIFFERENTLY. I'M PRETTY EXCITED TO FINALLY SEE WHAT THIS TRUCK CAN DO. ALL RIGHT, SEND HIM. LET'S SEE WHAT AARON'S GOT. THAT'S BETTER! OH, 9.5! JUSTIN, I THINK HE GOT YA. YOU KNOW, THE DRAG RACE WENT AS I'D EXPECT, AND THEN MAYBE BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. ALL RIGHT, AARON. HOW'D IT FEEL? UH, 11.96. -YEAH! - RIGHT ON. - YOU DID GOOD. - ALL RIGHT! - YOU DID GOOD. I THOUGHT THAT WAS RESPECTABLE FOR NEVER -- REALLY NEVER SHIFTING A 10-SPEED SEMI TRUCK, NEVER DRAG RACING A TRUCK EVER. ALLEN COMES IN IN FIRST PLACE. OF COURSE, OF COURSE. GOOD JOB, SIR. - THANK YOU. JOEY "THE DRAG RACER" COMES IN SECOND. TOMMY PULLED OUT THIRD. - YEAH! - AND AARON... HEY, GOOD JOB! ...YOU'RE FOURTH. BULL. THERE'S NO WAY. - YES. - WHOO! I'M NUMBER FOUR! I'M NUMBER FOUR! TO ACTUALLY FINISH FOURTH IN MY FIRST-EVER SEMI DRAG RACE AGAINST THE BEST RACERS IN THE COUNTRY SAYS TO ME MY SHIFTING WASN'T FAR OFF. I REALLY DIDN'T ASK FOR A BREAKDOWN FROM ANY OF THE OTHER GUYS ABOUT THEIR OPINION ON MY TRUCK, BUT, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF THEM OFFERED IT UP. HEY, AARON. YES, SIR? THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL TRUCK YOU GUYS BUILT. WELL, THANK YOU. THE WRAP WAS REALLY, REALLY NICE, ALL THE WELDS ON THE CAGE. YOU DO THESE WELDS YOURSELF, AARON, MAN? THERE'S PRETTY MUCH FOUR DIFFERENT GUYS WELDING ON THIS THING. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE FABRICATION WORK, THEY DID A PHENOMENAL JOB ON THAT TRUCK. - HEY, I LIKE THE WAY YOU -- - THANKS. LOW CAGE AND EVERYTHING UNDERNEATH THERE -- - THE SIDE PODS. - THE SIDE PODS AND STUFF. THE TRUCK THERE, IT'S AN AMAZING TRUCK. HE DONE GOOD, HE DONE REAL GOOD. I MEAN, IT REALLY LOOKS SLICK. -WE ONLY HAD TO REDO MOST OF IT. YOU JUST KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SOLID. THE OVAL RACE IS GONNA BE CHALLENGING. THE RACERS ARE LOOKING TO PUT DOWN THEIR BEST TIMES IN ANTICIPATION OF THEIR UPCOMING SEASON. WHEN IT COMES TO PROPER TECHNIQUE FOR OVAL RACING, I WISH I COULD TELL YOU, BECAUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT'S SOME BLACK MAGIC VOODOO. ADDITIONALLY, UNLIKE NASCAR, THESE CURVES ARE NOT BANKED. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN THIS RACE HAS GOT TO BE MY COMPETITION. THE OVAL TRACK IS WHAT THESE GUYS COMPETE ON EVERY WEEKEND. THESE GUYS ARE TRAINED CIRCLE DRIVERS. IN FACT, IN THE WORLD OF SEMI TRUCK RACING, CHRIS KIKELHAN PLACE FIFTH IN THE NATION. JUSTIN BALL PLACED THIRD. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS. IN THIS PHASE OF THE COMPETITION, WE'RE GONNA BE RACING ON THE 1/4 MILE OVAL. EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET EIGHT LAPS. ALL EIGHT LAPS ARE GONNA BE TIMED, AND YOUR SINGLE BEST LAP WILL BE SCORED FOR YOUR BEST LAP, OKAY? WE'RE GONNA SORT YOU GUYS OUT IN ORDER, FASTEST TO SLOWEST. CHRIS, YOU'RE UP. OKAY. - RIGHT ON. - LET'S DO IT. - GET 'EM, BIG DOG. - ALL RIGHT. GOING FIRST, IT'S -- IT'S TOUGH BEING OUT THERE AND NOT HAVING, LIKE, ANY IDEA WHAT YOUR TIME IS, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD GO HARDER OR WHATEVER, SO THAT'S ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF THAT STUFF IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR TIME. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO, BOYS. IF WE'RE TURNING LEFT THE ENTIRE TIME, ALL OF THE WEIGHT, ALL OF THE FORCES ARE GONNA BE ROLLED OVER ON TO THE RIGHT TIRES AND THE OUTSIDE EDGES OF THOSE TIRES. THIS IS WHERE THE EXPERIENCE IS REALLY GONNA PAY OFF. IF HE GETS CROSSED UP AND OVER CORRECTS... WHEN HE'S DRIFTING LIKE THAT HE'S LOSING SPEED. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS. CHRIS KIKELHAN -- THAT'S THE TIME TO BEAT. JUSTIN, YOU'RE UP. LET'S DO IT. HERE WE GO. SOME OF THE TURNS I COME IN TO COME IN A LITTLE HOT. WHOO! 19.90 -- JUST RAISED THE BAR. WHOO! COMING IN HOT! JUSTIN JUST LET IT RIP FROM THE STRAIGHTAWAYS. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS. JUSTIN BALL, 19.79. THIS IS THE NEW TIME TO BEAT. BUT ALLEN PUSHED INTO THE LEAD BY EASING OFF THE CORNERS AND KEEPING HIS OVERALL SPEED DOWN. 19.7 FLAT. WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A NEW LEADER. HEY, SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE. LOOK WHAT ALLEN'S TROWING DOWN. I MEAN, YOU WATCHED THESE PROS LIKE ALLEN TAKE THESE CORNERS, HARDLY STRUGGLING TO DO IT. HE'LL BE ABLE TO GET A 19.6, I'D SAY. YOU CAN SEE THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN HIS TECHNIQUE. IT'S SO IMPRESSIVE THAT HE'S THAT SMOOTH. AH, DAMN. - COME ON, JOEY. - GOOD LUCK. ALL RIGHT, JOEY, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. 19.7 FLAT IS OUR NEW FAST LAP. COME ON! YOU CAN DO IT! JOEY TOOK A MUCH DIFFERENT APPROACH. - HE'S GETTING GOOD, YEAH. - UH-HUH. OVAL TRACK I'LL DO DECENT -- FIRST COUPLE LAPS I TRIED TO GET AS FAST AS I COULD, AND THEN AFTER THAT JUST SIDEWAYS. I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT TOO EASY. - NO, NO! OH, NO! - DANG IT! - THAT WAS NOT GOOD. - THAT'S MY BOY! I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHARGE HIM FOR SOME GRASS REPAIR OUT THERE. YEAH, BABY! WENT PRETTY GOOD -- I GOT A 19.8. ALLEN'S 19.7 STILL HOLDS -- IT'S STILL THE TIME TO BEAT. SO, YOU GUYS ARE THE LAST TWO. - ALL RIGHT. - TOMMY, WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND MOUNT UP? LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT. WATCHING THE OTHER DRIVERS, I'M TRYING TO NOTICE WHAT THEIR TRUCKS ARE DOING, WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE TRACK, WHERE THEIR BRAKING, WHERE THEY'RE TURNING IN AT. IF YOU PAY ATTENTION, YOU KNOW, IF YOU OPEN YOUR EYES, YOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT THE TRACK AND ABOUT WHAT THE OTHER TRUCKS ARE EXPERIENCING. MAKE DADDY PROUD! I WAS JUST TRYING TO RUN IT AS SMOOTH AS I COULD, STAYING EASY ON THE THROTTLE, TRYING TO USE UP AS MUCH OF THAT TRACK AS I COULD. THE TRACK'S SUPER BUMPY OVER THERE. YEAH. OH! NOW THE FUN STARTS. - YEAH, THERE YOU GO! - YEAH! - ALL RIGHT. - AND THAT'S HOW YOU DRIVE! - HEY, AARON. - YEAH? - LET'S DO IT. - GO GET 'EM, AARON! COME ON, AARON! 19.7. YOU CAN DO IT. IT'S THE TIME TO BEAT. I'LL TELL YOU, THESE OTHER DRIVERS ARE PROBABLY SET UP BEST FOR OVAL RACING. AND SO THIS COULD GO GOOD OR THIS COULD BE A REALLY GREAT JOKE. AARON'S GONNA STRUGGLE, BECAUSE HIS TRUCK'S NEW AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THESE GUYS ARE UP TO. HE HASN'T DRIVEN ANYTHING BIG AND HEAVY. - PULL THE NEXT GEAR, AARON. - HE'S ON REV RIGHT THERE. EVERYBODY WAS KIND OF SHOUTING AND HOLLERING TRYING TO GET HIM TO GRAB ANOTHER GEAR. WE ARE ABOUT TO START THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS -- THE ROAD COURSE. I WENT A LITTLE BIT CONSERVATIVE AT FIRST, AND THEN I JUST WENT BACK TO JUST GOING BALLS OUT. - WHOA! - THE SHOWBOAT'S COMING OUT. AARON'S GONNA STRUGGLE BECAUSE HIS TRUCK'S NEW AND HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THESE GUYS ARE UP TO. HE HASN'T DRIVEN ANYTHING BIG AND HEAVY. A GOOD FINISH FOR ME ON OVAL IS NOT THE LAST CAR. ROCK 'N' ROLL. OKAY, I GOT IT. - RIGHT THERE, HE'S -- - PULL THE NEXT GEAR, AARON. - HE'S ON REV RIGHT THERE. - DID YOU TELL HIM TO SHIFT? YEAH, HE NEEDS ANOTHER GEAR FOR SURE. MY INEXPERIENCE WITH THE TRUCK, I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW IF I PUT IT IN EIGHTH IT WOULD LUG IT TOO HARD COMING OUT OF THE CORNERS. I HAD IT IN SEVENTH GEAR AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS GONNA RESPOND IN EIGHTH, AND IN SEVENTH, I FELT REALLY STABLE ON. NOW IT'S JUST TIME TO GO THROTTLE. IT'S HARD TO ACCELERATE WHEN YOU'RE SIDEWAYS. COMING OUT OF THE TURNS, IT SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS ALREADY ON REV LIMIT, SO EVERYBODY WAS KIND OF SHOUTING AND HOLLERING, TRYING TO GET HIM TO GRAB ANOTHER GEAR. OH, MY GOD. - THERE HE GOES! - WHOO! EVERYBODY SAID, "YOU COULD USE MORE GEAR. YOU NEED TO GO UP ONE." BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING, I REALLY WANTED TO PUT TOGETHER A NICE CLEAN LAP, SO I PUT IT IN EIGHTH AND GAVE IT ROOM TO STRETCH ITS LEGS, AND THEN A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL GAME. I THOUGHT, "WELL, HELL, LET'S JUST TRY AND SLIDE THE ENTIRE TRACK." NOT THE FASTEST TRUCK, BUT I THINK WE FIGURED OUT WHAT IT DOES WELL. I JUST WANTED TO PLAY WITH MY BIG TOY. AFTER ALL, THAT'S WHY WE BUILT IT. I'VE NEVER SEEN A TRUCK LIKE THAT SLIDE SIDEWAYS. IT WAS PRETTY FREAKIN' COOL. THAT THING IS ALMOST 12,000 POUNDS. HE WAS JUST WHIPPING THAT THING AROUND LIKE, MAKING IT HIS BITCH. - YEAH! - LOOK AT HIM SLIDE! - YEAH, BABY! - OH, MY GOSH. AARON, HE JUST TORE IT UP, MAN. THAT WAS JUST CRAZY. UH, THERE TRUCK THERE, IT'S AMAZING. SO, OVERALL, I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH HOW THE MODIFICATIONS ON THE TRUCK PERFORMED. BETTER REAR SUSPENSION WOULD HAVE MADE A BIG, BIG DIFFERENCE, BUT I NEVER FELT A LACK OF POWER. BUT JUST THE FACT THAT IT WAS LEGITIMATELY ABLE TO HANG WITH THE CHAMPIONSHIP OVAL RACERS, I MEAN, GEE WHIZ, THAT WAS TOO MUCH FUN. YEAH! I CAN'T DRIVE A RACECAR, BUT I CAN GO SIDEWAYS! YEAH, HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE FUN IN A TRUCK SIDEWAYS? THIRD PLACE... TOMMY. - HEY! - YEAH! AGAIN, SECOND PLACE, JUSTIN. - ALL RIGHT! - HEY! - YEAH! - RIGHT ON. AND THE OLD MAN. HEY, GUYS. - TAKING 'EM TO SCHOOL. - ALLEN SCHOOLS THE BOYS AGAIN. HEY, I'LL TAKE THAT THEN, GUYS. GOOD WORK, YOU GUYS. GOOD WORK. - ALL RIGHT. - THIS HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN. YEAH, AND WE'RE NOT DONE. TOMORROW, WE'RE GONNA PUT 'EM TO GO RIGHT IN AND LAST A LITTLE FURTHER. I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE FUN. - AWESOME! - YEAH! LET'S DO IT. GOOD JOB, GUYS. - LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WHOO! - AARON, YOU GUYS READY? - WE ARE. ALL RIGHT, WE ARE ABOUT TO START THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS -- THE ROAD COURSE. OUR THIRD COMPETITION IS THE ROAD COURSE. IT INCORPORATES ELEMENTS OF OUR PREVIOUS TWO COMPETITIONS AND ADDS A WILD CARD -- RIGHT-HAND TURNS. BECAUSE YOU'RE TRANSITIONING FROM HARD LEFT TURNS TO HARD RIGHT TURNS, THE TRICK IS GETTING A 12,000-POUND TRUCK TO QUICKLY CHANGE DIRECTIONS. AND THE WAY WE MANAGE TO HELP MAKE OUR TRUCK DO THAT IS THE ADDITION OF A FRONT ANTI-SWAY BAR. ULTIMATELY, THE TRUCK HAS MANY MODIFICATIONS THAT IMPROVE ITS CAPABILITIES, HOWEVER, IN ANY RACE VEHICLE, THERE'S ONE MODIFICATION THAT'S GUARANTEED TO IMPROVE YOUR LAP TIMES -- UPGRADING THE DRIVER. YEAH. YEAH. AND WE GOT THAT COVERED WHEN I CAME OUT HERE A WHILE BACK TO LEARN FROM DRIVING INSTRUCTOR TOMMY BOILEAU... ...WHO, WHEN HE WAS 14, BECAME THE YOUNGEST AMERICAN GRANTED A ROAD-RACE LICENSE. THIS ROAD RACE IS GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, ARE THOSE TWO SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS ENOUGH TO HELP ME HANG WITH THE BIG BOYS? ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA GET FIVE TIMED LAPS, AND WE'RE GONNA KICK IT OFF IN THE SAME ORDER. CHRIS, YOU'RE UP, BUDDY. THERE'S A SURPRISE. ALL THESE OTHER GUYS, LIKE, THEY KNOW THEIR TRUCKS. THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF RACES IN THEIR TRUCKS. I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST AN EXTENSION OF THEIR BODY. IT'S JUST LIKE, THAT TRUCK IS LIKE THEIR FEET TO ME. LOOKING GOOD. WHOO! HE'S TAKING THIS ONE SERIOUSLY. WHOA! THE ROAD COURSE WENT GREAT. I WENT A LITTLE BIT CONSERVATIVE AT FIRST. THAT LOOKED PRETTY GOOD. AND THEN I JUST WENT BACK TO JUST GOING BALLS OUT. THE SHOWBOAT'S COMIN' OUT. - YEAH. - WHOA. BER-BER-BER, BER-BER-BER-BER. ALL RIGHT, WELL, AT 31, MAN, THAT'S A NUMBER RIGHT THERE. CHECKERED FLAG. - WE'RE AT 31 WHAT? 31.7? - 31.8. I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED BY THAT LAP. - YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. - JUSTIN, YOU READY? YEAH. 31.7 -- THAT'S THE TIME TO BEAT. COME ON. SO, LIKE LAST TIME, JUSTIN HIT THE COURSE HARD... AND ONCE AGAIN RAISED THE BAR. WE GOT A NEW LEADER! ALLEN, YOU'RE UP. - ALL RIGHT. IF ANYBODY COULD BEAT THAT TIME, IT WOULD BE OUR VETERAN, AL. BUT IN THIS CASE, EXPERIENCE PROVED NO MATCH FOR YOUTHFUL EXUBERANCE. 31.1. MAYBE WE FINALLY FOUND ALLEN'S WEAKNESS. HE CAN'T TURN LEFT. SO, WHAT DO WE GOT NOW? JOEY? ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IT. 30.9 IS THE TIME TO BEAT. AND IF YOUTH IS THE KEY, THEN JOEY HAS IT IN SPADES. BUT IN THE END, HE WAS WAY OFF THE MARK. YOU'RE DONE! NO, GET THAT OUT OF THERE. TOMMY, IT'S DOWN TO YOU AND A-ARON. AND TOMMY DIDN'T FAIR MUCH BETTER. ALL RIGHT, HEY, LISTEN, GUYS. THAT, UH -- THAT LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM OUT THERE FOR YOU, A-ARON. - YEAH. - YOU READY? AS MUCH AS I'M EVER GONNA BE. - LET'S DO IT. - ALL RIGHT. I THINK OUR TRUCK CAN BE 100 PERCENT COMPETITIVE. I REALLY THINK YOU COULD SCARE SOME PEOPLE. I THINK I COULD EDGE UP ALL OF THOSE TIMES. I LOVE PITCHING THE TRUCK DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND THROWING IT AROUND. I REALLY DO LIKE THE ROAD COURSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. HEY, IS BOB OVER THERE? BOB-BOB. - BOB! YES? I'VE GOT A MALFUNCTION LIGHT. OH, WE GOT A CODE POPPED UP ON HIS TRUCK. WE GOT A CODE POPPED UP ON HIS TRUCK? WELL, IT'S HIS TIME TO GO. I MEAN, DOES THE CLOCK START NOW? IT'S NOT SEEING THE SPEED SENSOR. - AARON'S ROLLIN'. - THIS IS A DIFFICULT TRACK TO RUN A BIG TRUCK ON WELL. ALL RIGHT, SETTLE DOWN. WE ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL COMPETITION. WE CAME OUT HERE TO KILL IT, SO LET'S JUST SMASH IT. - OHH! - OHH! NOW I GUESS IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF THE TURBO OR THE TIRES GONNA LET LOOSE. - OHH! HEY, IS BOB OVER THERE? - BOB! - YES? I'VE GOT A MALFUNCTION LIGHT. - OH - THE ECM. I'VE GOT A CODE. WELL, WE CAN CHECK IT REAL QUICK. SO, JUST AS I'M ABOUT TO START MY ROAD COURSE RACE, MY TRUCK THREW UP A MALFUNCTION. - WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? RPMs? - ALL RIGHT, I GOT A SPEED SENSOR AND "MISSING OTHER ECU INFORMATION"? IT'S NOT SEEING THE SPEED SENSOR. A BUNCH OF NOTHIN'. THERE'S NO ISSUE. NOTHIN'S GONNA CAUSE IT TO DERATE OR BLOW UP, NO. COOL. NO, THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW, RUN THIS DOG. HEY, YOU GUYS. WE GOT OUR LAST DRIVER MOUNTED UP. AARON'S IN THERE. JUSTIN, YOU'RE LEADING WITH A 30.9, THEN IT'S ALLEN AND CHRIS. AARON'S ROLLIN'. LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S GOT. THIS IS A DIFFICULT TRACK TO RUN A BIG TRUCK ON WELL. HARD ON THE BRAKES, HARD TO ACCELERATION. ALL RIGHT, SETTLE DOWN. WHOO! THE REAR SUSPENSION DID NOT DEAL WITH THE BUMPS ON THE BACK EXIT VERY WELL AT ALL, SO, BASICALLY, IF I WAS ON THROTTLE, THE TRUCK WAS JUST HOPPING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE BACK STRAIGHT. THAT'S A SECOND OFF. HE'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. GO! GO! THIS IS A BRAND-NEW TRUCK FOR ME, AND I'M DEFINITELY LEARNING IT. - OOH! HE PICKED UP A BUNCH. - HE'S GETTING FASTER. HE MAY HAVE SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE. I DON'T THINK SO. 33.7 WITH THE SHOWBOAT. - YEAH. - THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD RUN. - ALL RIGHT, AARON. - YEAH! MOST IMPROVED! - 33.2. NOT TOO BAD. - ALL RIGHT! A 33.2 IS LESS THAN A SECOND OFF THE NEXT BEST TIME. NOT TOO SHABBY IF YOU REMEMBER THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL RACERS. WINNERS FIRST. JUSTIN. - WHOO! WON THIS COMPETITION. GOOD JOB. SECOND PLACE WAS ALLEN. YEAH, BUDDY. ALLEN'S BEEN ON THE PODIUM EVERY TIME SO FAR. - I KNOW. - CHRIS GOT THIRD. - YEAH! - GOOD JOB, BUDDY. SO, EVEN THOUGH THE SEAT-TIME ADVANTAGE SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE, IT SEEMS THAT BETWEEN THE MODIFICATIONS AND THE BIT OF DRIVER TRAINING, I WAS ABLE TO HANG IN THERE. SO, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW IS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS -- FREESTYLE. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, WE ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL COMPETITION, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ONE PROBABLY THE MOST, BECAUSE IT GETS TO SEE YOUR CREATIVITY. THE FINAL COMPETITION IS FREESTYLE. IT MIGHT BE A FAN FAVORITE, BUT IT'S JUST ABOUT THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING WE CAN DO WITH OUR TRUCKS. WE GOT THE COURSE SET UP WHERE THERE'S SOME CONES OUT THERE, THERE'S SOME BARRELS OUT THERE. THE MIDDLE ONE IS THE CAMERA CONE WITH THE GoPros ON IT. PLEASE DON'T HIT THAT ONE. YOU'RE GONNA JUDGE EACH OTHER, ON A SCORE OF 1 TO 5, 5 BEING THE BEST. QUESTION? CHRIS, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW, RIGHT? - I GO FIRST, LIKE USUAL. - YOU'RE FIRST. - ALL RIGHT. - GET 'EM DONE, BUDDY. I THINK FREESTYLE'S GONNA BE FUN, BECAUSE THE GUYS ARE GONNA WANT TO CUT LOOSE. I HAVE A FEELING THEY'RE GONNA BURN THEIR STUFF DOWN TRYING TO OUTDO EACH OTHER. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW IT PLAYS OUT. LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED. HERE COMES THE WILD MAN HIMSELF -- CHRIS. HERE WE GO. YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. I'M NOT JUST THE STEERING-WHEEL-HOLDER GUY. I TAKE IT TO THE EDGE. LOOK AT CHRIS. HE IS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF CONTROL. THAT GUY IS A MADMAN. - WHOA! - THAT'S NOT FUN. I WENT OUT HARD, PRETTY MUCH DRIFTED AROUND THE WHOLE OUTSIDE. - JUST HIT EVERYTHING, CHRIS. SMOKED THE TRUCK OUT, BLEW LIKE THREE TIRES. - THERE GOES ONE. - OVERHEATED THE TRUCK. CHRIS IS GONNA GO TILL THAT THING EXPLODES. LOOK AT HIM. I CAUGHT THE TRACK ON FIRE, WHICH WAS A TRACK FIRST TODAY. WOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO JUDGE THAT. I WENT OUT AND SET THE TONE. THAT'S WHAT I DO. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE JUSTIN. SO LET'S DO IT, BUDDY. COME ON. - GET 'ER DONE. - GOOD LUCK. - ALL RIGHT. THE FREESTYLE'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST FUN THINGS, SEEING IF YOU COULD MAKE THE TRUCK SLIDE LIKE YOU CAN A CAR. LOOK AT JUSTIN WHIP THAT THING AROUND. HE IS KILLIN' IT. SETTLE DOWN, JUSTIN. YOU'RE NOT ME. WHEN WE COME TO THE FREESTYLE TODAY, THE BACK END ON THE TRUCK STARTED HOPPING AROUND A BUNCH ON ME, DOOR FLEW OPEN... - AND THE DOOR'S OPEN. - SETTLE DOWN, YOU WUSS! ...AND JUST SAID, "WELL, WE'LL JUST RUN IT ANYWAY." - WHOA! - THERE GOES A FENDER. - CAN WE GO NEGATIVE? - OHH! IS THERE NEGATIVE NUMBERS HERE? ALLEN, ARE YOU READY TO GO OUT THERE AND SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE? - ALL RIGHT, GUYS. - ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET IT. FLIP ME OUT, GUYS. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, HERE GOES ALLEN. LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S GOT. - OOH! NICE CONE! - HE GOT THE CONE. HE IS PUTTING UP A TON OF SMOKE. LOOK AT THAT. HE CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT HE'S DOING. HE DON'T EVEN KNOW. HE'S LIKE THIS BEHIND THE WHEEL. I LITERALLY LOST HIM IN THE SMOKE. JOEY, YOU GOT THE RIGHT TIRES ON FOR THIS? - OH, YEAH. - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FOR US? - BLOW 'EM. - YOU'RE GONNA BLOW 'EM? - YEAH. - LET'S DO IT. I WASN'T REAL NERVOUS GOING INTO THE FREESTYLE. I DO BURNOUT SHOWS EVERY NOW AND THEN. A COUPLE TRUCK SHOWS HERE AND THERE A YEAR. AND IMMEDIATELY, JOEY IS SPINNING THAT THING AROUND. HOLY MOLY, THAT IS CRAZY! HIT THE BARREL, JOE! THERE HE GOES. NO! TOMMY, YOU'RE UP. YOU READY? - LET'S DO IT. - LET'S DO IT. - COME ON, BUDDY. - THE FREESTYLE IS KIND OF COOL. I GOT TO WATCH MOST OF THE OTHER GUYS GO FIRST, SO I KIND OF HAD A FEEL FOR WHAT THE JUDGE PANEL OF MY PEERS WAS FEELING WAS GOOD AND WHAT WASN'T. WHOA, LOOK AT THAT. TOMMY IS ABSOLUTELY PUTTING SOME STYLE INTO THE STYLE COMPETITION. - WHOA, BARREL. - YEAH! - YEAH! WHOA, LOOK AT THIS. HE'S ACTUALLY PLAYING TO THE JUDGES. HE'S COMING RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF US. LOOK AT THAT! - THERE'S A BARREL. - OH, YEAH! AT LEAST IT'S BEEN ENTERTAINING SO FAR. I WAS GOING FOR MORE TECHNIQUE AND PRECISION LIKE WHAT YOU'D SEE IN A DRIFT COMPETITION, DOING REAL TIGHT DONUTS AROUND THE GoPro CAM. THAT IS CRAZY! IT WAS REALLY ENTERTAINING. THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD RUN, RIGHT THERE. TOMMY'S WAS ENTERTAINING. TOMMY'S WAS PERHAPS THE MOST COMPLEX. YOU BLEW INTO THE LEAD WITH A 17. - YEAH! - GOOD JOB. - AWESOME. - HEY, ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN. ALL RIGHT. 'CAUSE AARON'S UP. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS THAT CRUSHING STUFF IS A CROWD FAVORITE. HERE WE GO. AND SO, I TOOK LIFE BY THE REIGNS AND CRUSHED MY OWN TRUCK. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, HERE GOES AARON. LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S GOT. OH! THE PRODUCTION VALUE OF DESTRUCTION. - THERE GO THE CAMERAS. - OHH! IS HIS ACCELERATOR STUCK? -HERE HE COMES! - WHOO! - YEAH! - ARE WE ROLLIN' OR NO, ARE WE? - WE ARE ROLLING. - OKAY. - NEVER HAD LINES BEFORE. THIS GOES BACK TO MY ACTING DAYS. NINE, EIGHT, SPEEDING. I'M CHRIS DE LA GARZA, DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE NEW SHOW "SHIFTING GEARS." THIS YEAR, WE'VE GOT BETTER CAMERAS, WE'VE GOT BETTER DRONES. HELL, WE EVEN HIRED BETTER DRIVERS. HOW WAS THAT? LES, THAT WAS IT. LET'S CALL IT GOOD. LET'S CALL IT GOOD. HERE WE GO. IT'S FINALLY MY TURN ON THE FREESTYLE CONTEST, AND I HOPE I DON'T REGRET THIS. AARON'S GOING OUT. LOOK AT THAT. AND HE IS SLIDING THAT THING AROUND. OH! HE ACTS LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. THERE GO THE CAMERAS. - OHH! - WHOA! NOT IN THE CAMERAS!. YEAH, WELL, GoPros ARE INVINCIBLE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT OR NOT, BUT GoPros SURVIVE EVERYTHING. AND IT TAKES SOMEONE LIKE ME THAT UNDERSTANDS "A" THE RACECAR, AND THEN "B" THE PRODUCTION VALUE OF DESTRUCTION. AARON IS OUT THERE KILLING IT. LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DOING. IS HIS ACCELERATOR STUCK? HE'S TRYING TO SHOW UP TOMMY, AND TOMMY KIND OF RAISED THE BAR. OH, MY GOSH! DID YOU SEE THAT? WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIS NOSE? OH, LOOK AT THAT! HIS NOSE JUST FLIPPED OFF THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK! WHAT'S HE GONNA DO? RUN IT OVER! HE'S GONNA RUN OVER IT! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! - YES! - YEAH! I DECIDE TO MAKE ABOUT, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A $5,000 AND $6,000 CHOICE TO RUN OVER MY OWN HOOD. NOW THAT'S HOW YOU DRIVE! - TOTAL DESTRUCTION. NICE RUN. - OH, MY GOSH. - MASS DESTRUCTION. - OKAY. GO AROUND THE HOOD. YEAH! WHOO, BOYS! I DON'T KNOW, FELLAS. EVERYBODY TAKES MY MOTTO -- JUST DESTROY YOUR I TOOK A COUPLE PAGES FROM CHRIS'S BOOK OF HOW TO DRIVE, AND I WROTE THE WHOLE REST OF THE BOOK, I THINK. OH, THIS IS EXCESSIVE, BUT I LIKE IT. BUT I LIKE IT. YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER THAT GUY THAT RIPS HIS HOOD OFF. I'VE HAD SO MANY TIMES WHERE I'VE COME IN THIRD PLACE OR SECOND PLACE, BUT JUST LIKE BOUNCED OFF THE WALL AND TOTALLY SIDEWAYS, AND PEOPLE, THEY COME TO SEE ME AFTER INSTEAD OF MAYBE THE GUY THAT WON. YES! YES! - WHAT DID YOU BREAK? - CHRIS, WE'RE STARTING WITH YOU. - OH, MAN. - PROBABLY GIVE HIM A 4. - 4. - I'M GONNA GO 5. I THINK AARON ACTUALLY KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK THIS TIME. I MEAN, THE HOOD COMING OFF AND HE WAS JUST BURNING -- MELTING THE TIRES PLUM OFF A BRAND-NEW TRUCK. SO, AARON. YES, SIR. YOUR BOYS HAVE SCORED YOU... OKAY. LET ME KNOW HOW BAD IT IS. ...WITH A 22. - AHH! - YES! I WON SOMETHING! SO, YOU GUYS, TOMMY IS SECOND, AND CHRIS IN THIRD. IT'S COOL TO HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE THAT SEE THINGS THE SAME WAY YOU DO AND LOVE BEATING ON RACE EQUIPMENT. YOU GUYS ALL ABSOLUTELY THREW DOWN. - HELL, YEAH. - THAT WAS AMAZING. AARON DID REALLY WELL. IF HE WOULD'VE HAD A CHANCE TO GO OUT AND PLAY WITH THAT TRUCK FOR A DAY INSTEAD OF LITERALLY GETTING IT BUILT, FLYING IT FROM TEXAS UP TO HERE, TO GET IT HERE AND RUN IT IN TIME, I THINK HE WOULD'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT BETTER. BUT, ALL IN ALL, HE SURPRISED ME, ESPECIALLY IN THE FREESTYLE. HE KILLED IT. SO, ANYHOW, I'M GONNA GET THE TOTAL. YOU GUYS, THIS WAS FANTASTIC. - WE'RE ALL WINNERS, BOB. - WE CAN DO MATH. WE'RE OKAY. - WE'RE ALL WINNERS. CHRIS, YOU ARE ALL WINNERS. BUT, NO. IT'S OBVIOUS WHY I WON, I THINK. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT DROVE OVER THEIR OWN CAR. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN TALLIED. IT WAS A GOOD FIGHT. JUSTIN, THIRD PLACE IN THIS COMPETITION. - ALL RIGHT. - GOOD JOB. TAKING THIRD, SIT UP IN THE TOP THREE, I MEAN, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. TOMMY, YOU WOULD UP IN TWO. - YEAH! - WHOO! THIS WAS A BLAST. IT'S SAD THAT IT'S COMING TO AN END. BUT IT JUST MEANS RACE SEASON'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND HOPEFULLY, WE CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME THERE, KEEP SEEING THE GUYS, SEE AARON AGAIN SOON. AND ALLEN IS THE VICTOR! HEY, I GOT FIRST OVERALL, AND I'M HAPPY. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO BE, YOU KNOW, FIRST, WITH THE NUMBER-3 TRUCK. GOOD JOB, BUDDY. GOOD JOB. LIKE I'VE SAID SO MANY TIMES, WE ONLY MAKE SO MANY TRIPS AROUND THE SUN, AND QUITE FRANKLY, THERE'S NO DRUG -- YOU CAN'T BUY THIS DRUG ANYWHERE ELSE. I'M REALLY GLAD YOU DECIDED TO COME OUT HERE AND JOIN THESE BOYS. SO I HAD A BLAST. IT'S OBVIOUS I'VE GOT SOME CATCHING UP TO DO. BUT THANKS FOR LETTING ME SLIDE IN HERE AND HAVING SOME FUN WITH YOU. AND YOU WON ONE OF THEM. - YEAH! - COME ON, MAN. YOU KNOW, WE REALLY HAD VERY, VERY, VERY LITTLE TIME TO PUT THIS TRUCK TOGETHER, AND WE HAD SOME GREAT HELP FROM SOME TREMENDOUS PEOPLE. AND HONESTLY, I THINK WE DID A GOOD JOB. I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE RACECARS, ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE CARS, WE'VE EVER BUILT. THANKS, YOU GUYS. THIS WAS A LOT OF FUN. - THANKS, MAN. - ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, I KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS NOW. -YEAH. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I HAD A GREAT TIME, AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF MY TRUCK, AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF MY TEAM. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MY FRIENDS AT THE NEXT RACE. -YEAH, THAT WAS GREAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE A BUNCH OF DUMB, PUNK KIDS THAT WENT OUT AND PLAYED. THESE ARE OUR TOYS AND WE DON'T BUILD THEM TO NOT PLAY WITH THEM. I DIDN'T WIN A TROPHY, I DIDN'T WIN A RACE, BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS. MAN, OH, MAN, WAS DRIVING THAT BIG TRUCK SIDEWAYS, THAT WAS IT FOR ME. HOW MUCH FUN.
