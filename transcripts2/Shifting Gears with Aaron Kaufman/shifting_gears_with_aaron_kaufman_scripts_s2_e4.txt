 Kaufman: I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HANDPICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL, AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST.

 I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS TONIGHT, MY CREW AND I BUILD A MODEL "A" RAIL DRAGSTER... I CAN'T STOP! WHERE'S THE REST OF IT? ...AND PREPARE MY HARLEY... THAT'S IT. ...FOR THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN. AN EVENT THAT CELEBRATES OUR PAST, OUR CULTURES, HOT RODDING. BUT OUR RENDEZVOUS WITH THE PAST SEEMS LIKE A SHOT IN THE DARK... BEING WITHOUT POWER DOES KIND OF SCREW UP A FEW THINGS. ...AS WE BATTLE TIME... WE'RE, LIKE, WEEKS AWAY. ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GONNA PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER FOR THIS?

 ...AND UNEXPECTED MECHANICAL MISHAPS. OH, NO! I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE FILLED THAT RADIATOR UP. OH, GOODNESS GRACIOUS. Kaufman: QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK, QUACK. YOU KNOW, BILL, WERE YOU AWARE OF RACE OF GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SHOWED YOU? OKAY. SO I LOVE OLD STUFF. I LOVE THAT THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY, REALLY DO ENJOY THE OLD STYLE, THE OLD WAY, THE OLD APPEARANCE, SO IT'S REALLY TO RELIVE SOMETHING THAT IS VERY ROMANTIC TO ME ABOUT HAVING LESS AND DOING MORE WITH IT. A COUPLE YEARS AGO, I BECAME AWARE OF A THING CALLED THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN THEY HAVE ON THE EAST COAST, IN THE JERSEY SHORE, IN A TOWN CALLED WILDWOOD, AN EVENT THAT CELEBRATES OUR PAST, THAT CELEBRATES OUR HISTORY, OUR HERITAGE, OUR CULTURES, HOT RODDING, AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE NEW STUFF UNLESS YOU APPRECIATE THE OLD STUFF, WHERE WE COME FROM. THESE GUYS GET TOGETHER, AND THEY'RE BUILDING DRAG CARS, AND THEY'RE GOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN, SEE WHO CAN GET DOWN THE BEACH, 660 FEET, THE FASTEST, AND THEY'RE DOING IT ALL WITH PERIOD-CORRECT RACE CARS AND MOTORCYCLES. AND WHAT BEAUTIFUL PLACE, WHAT A WONDERFUL EVENT. SO I WASN'T ABLE TO GO FOR A COUPLE YEARS AFTER I BECAME AWARE OF IT, AND THEN I FINALLY PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE '45... AND SINCE THE HARLEY NEEDED A LITTLE WORK, I PLANNED TO TAKE IT TO THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN. ...AND JUST COULDN'T QUITE GET IT TOGETHER. I DIDN'T HAVE THE PARTS OR THE TIME TO MAKE IT TO THAT YEAR'S RACE IN NEW JERSEY, SO THAT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE UP FOR, AND SINCE THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN FEATURES BOTH MOTORCYCLES AND RACE CARS, THIS YEAR I PLAN TO GO BIG AND HIT BOTH CATEGORIES. AND SO I TALKED TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO RUNS THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN. HE HAS A NEW CLASS, AND THE NEW CLASS IS A RAIL DRAGSTER, BUT THE IDEA IS, IT PREDATES WHEN DRAGSTERS EXISTED, SO THE RULES FOR THIS CLASS STIPULATE THAT IT BE A MODEL-T FRAME OR AN "A" FRAME. SO BESIDES BRINGING MY MOTORCYCLE, I DECIDED TO BUILD A MODEL "A" BECAUSE IT'S SO ICONIC TO HOT RODDING. YOU KNOW, THE MODEL "T" HAD A LONG NINE-YEAR RUN, AND THE REST OF FORD'S COMPETITOR'S HAD BEGUN TO CATCH UP, SO IN 1927, HENRY FORD INTRODUCED THE MODEL "A." IT WAS NOT ONLY A BIG STEP FORWARD IN ENGINEERING BUT ALSO KEPT THE COST DOWN. A MODEL "A" STARTED AT ONLY $385, AND BY 1930, OVER THREE MILLION WERE ON THE ROAD. NOW, JUMP AHEAD TWO DECADES, AND THERE'S A HUGE SURPLUS OF MODEL As THAT CAN BE PICKED UP FOR NEXT TO NOTHING. FOR A YOUNG KID WHO HAD A LITTLE MONEY AND WANTED TO BUILD HIS FIRST RACE CAR, THEY WERE A PERFECT SOLUTION, AND THAT'S WHY THEY'VE BECOME SO ICONIC IN HOT RODDING. AND SO WE CAME UP WITH A MODEL "A" LISTED JUST A COUPLE HOURS NORTH OF WHERE THE SHOP IS, SO WE'RE UP HERE IN OKLAHOMA, JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RED RIVER. ARE YOU THE ONE WE'S A-WAITING ON? YEAH. THAT'D BE ME. AND WE HAVE A ALLEGEDLY RUNNING AND DRIVING MODEL "A." - I'M RONNIE. - RONNIE? - NICE TO MEET YOU. - NICE TO MEET YOU, SIR. - YEAH. - HOW YOU DOING THIS MORNING? WELL, WE'RE ALIVE. YEAH, YEAH. WHAT YOU THINK? YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THIS LITTLE HALF CAR? - LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HER. - YES, SIR. SO THIS GUY I KNEW UP IN NORTHERN OKLAHOMA -- HE BOUGHT IT IN WEST VIRGINIA. GOT A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING AROUND HERE. HIS WIFE WAS TELLING HIM HE NEEDED TO GET THAT OUT OF THEIR GARAGE. OLD BOY HAD A BIG OLD BOX OF STUFF FOR SALE. - YEAH. - AND I BOUGHT ALL OF IT. HE ENDED UP LETTING ME HAVE IT. NOT HAVE IT, BUT, I MEAN, SOLD IT TO ME PRETTY CHEAP. SO IT'S RUNNING, DRIVABLE RIGHT NOW? I'VE NEVER STARTED IT. OKAY. THE GUY I GOT IT FROM SAID IT WOULD FIRE RIGHT UP. THAT'S VERY POSSIBLE. BUT I BELIEVED HIM, SO I DIDN'T EVEN START IT. YOU GOT A SODA BOTTLE WE CAN PUT FUEL IN? PUT SOME FUEL IN? OH, YEAH. WE'LL SURE GET SOMETHING. SO I'M SUPPOSED TO BE BUYING A RUNNING AND DRIVING MODEL "A," BUT I'VE WORKED ON A LOT OF MODEL As, AND YOU CAN ALMOST SEE WHAT'S GOING ON FROM A DISTANCE. SOMEONE SNIPPED THE WIRES ON THE COIL, AND THE POINTS ARE CORRODED, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SUPER-PRESSING TO DO, SO I FIGURED LET'S JUST SEE IF IT RUNS AND DRIVES. Maples: JUST WHOOP THAT BOOGER OFF. SO THE 6-VOLT BATTERY IS DEAD. HE HAD PUT WATER IN IT, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT HE PUT IN IT, AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY TIMES IT'S BEEN CHARGED? WE'LL MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN, WON'T WE? YEAH, WE'LL MAKE HER HAPPEN WITH THIS. A RUNNING CAR OR A FIRE, ONE OF THE TWO. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE WE GO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT, BUT IT'LL START HISSING, AND THAT'S USUALLY A PRECURSOR TO IT EXPLODING. JUST HEADS UP, IF THAT BATTERY POPS, IT'S GOING TO... IT'S JUST KIND OF SCARY. THAT'S ALL. YEAH. CRANK ON IT A COUPLE TIMES, AND THEN IT JUST RAN FOR HALF A SECOND AND DIED. COULD BE FUEL, COULD BE IGNITION. - WELL, YOU GOT ANOTHER STARTER? - NO, I DON'T. Kaufman: BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT WE ONLY GOT A COUPLE TRIES AT IT BEFORE THE STARTER GOT HUNG. I KNOW THAT THING WORKS. SO WE JUST KIND OF FIXED THAT SO THAT THE GEAR ENGAGES, PUT IT BACK IN.Both: THERE IT IS. I THOUGHT YOU WERE RUNNING THE GAS CAN. WELL... IT'S RUNNING NOW. GOOD. I SAY PLUG THAT THING ON THERE, AND WE CAN GO FOR A RIDE. Maples: WE GOT THAT THING RUNNING. IT TOOK TWO OR THREE HOURS, AND HE'S FROM TEXAS. HE AIN'T USED TO THIS MUCH WORK. I HOPE THE BRAKES WORK. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I HOPE THEY DO. I DON'T KNOW. I'M HEADED TO DALLAS. - I HOPE YOU LIKE DALLAS. - YEAH, LET'S GO. WE'LL GET IN THE FAST LANE, AND WE'LL ROLL. THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN. IT DOES SEEM TO RUN VERY SMOOTH, DOES SEEM TO BE... REASONABLY RELIABLE. OH, NO! OH, GOODNESS GRACIOUS. OH, SHE GETTING HOT. I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE FILLED THAT RADIATOR UP. A MODEL "A" IS A CAR -- DRIVES LIKE EVERY OTHER CAR, AND IT NEEDS COOLANT LIKE ANY OTHER CAR. ONE FOR YOU. ONE FOR ME. YOU WANT TO TRY IT AGAIN OR WHAT? YEAH, LET'S GO FOR A RIDE. HELL, WE AIN'T GOT NO DAMN HORN. I WISH WE'D HAVE HOOKED UP THE HORN. BEEP, BEEP! Kaufman: I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S IN TIP-TOP SHAPE, BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY MAINLY TO DO WITH JUST KIND OF SITTING OUTSIDE A LITTLE BIT. EVERYTHING WORKS ON IT. THE BRAKES WORK ON IT. THE PARK BRAKE WORKS ON IT, BUT COOL THING IS, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO IT. NOW THAT WE GOT IT RUNNING, WHAT WAS YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT? BASICALLY PUT A CHAIR ON IT, A ROLL BAR AND GO RACE IT. ALL RIGHT. COULD IT BE IN BETTER SHAPE? YEAH. BUT FOR THE PRICE -- I'D SAY IT'S INCREDIBLY GOOD SHAPE FOR THE PRICE, SO I THINK THAT THIS WOULD POINT. LOOK LIKE THE RIGHT NUMBER OF THEM TO ME. THAT'S IT. YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT. Bill: "DELIVERANCE" BACK HERE. DA-DA-LING, DING, DING, DING, DING, DING. ALL RIGHT, DID YOU GET ON CAMERA THAT AARON SAID HE COULD TURN THIS THING AROUND ANYWHERE? Man: I DON'T THINK SO. BILL, YOU'RE, LIKE, 200 YARDS FROM THE FREEWAY. - OH! - IT TOTALLY DOES! IT TOTALLY DOES! HOW COOL IS THIS, IF YOU'RE JUST BOMBING THROUGH HERE? I JUST GOT TO CHECK IT OUT REAL QUICK. 180? SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE BRIDGE IS OUT. - HOW DEEP WAS IT? - OH, 6 FEET. SO I WANTED TO BUILD THIS MODEL "A," DRAGSTER-RAIL-JOB THING, AND THAT REQUIRES A MODEL "A" CHASSIS, SO NOW I GOT ONE. SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE REALLY DOING THIS -- TAKING THIS MODEL "A" AND MY MOTORCYCLE TO THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN, AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS T.R.O.G. ALL WE GOT TO DO IS EVERYTHING. Webster: THAT THING IS SO AWESOME. ANYBODY ORDER A RACE CAR? HEY, WHERE'S THE REST OF IT? - THAT'S IT, HUH? - THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. WELL, MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS, "AT LEAST THIS TEARDOWN IS GONNA BE REALLY EASY." SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA START WITH, AND I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER. WE'LL ULTIMATELY USE THIS REAR END, PARTS OF THIS SUSPENSION, PARTS OF THIS STEERING AND PARTS OF THIS BRAKE. THE TRANSMISSION -- WE'LL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO USE. IT'S GOT OUR PEDAL ASSEMBLIES AND ALL THAT STUFF ON IT. WE'LL JUST MOVE HOW THEY WORK AND THEIR LOCATIONS IN THE VEHICLE, AND THEN, LIKE, I HAVEN'T CONSIDERED WHAT SUSPENSIONS BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE I MIGHT REMOVE THE SUSPENSION OUT OF IT, AND IT'S LIKE... IT GETS A LITTLE CHOPPY, BUT YOU JUST, YOU KNOW, PUT A PIECE OF LEATHER BETWEEN YOUR TEETH AND HAMMER IT, RIGHT? BUT THE... WELL, IT'S ONLY, WHAT, 660 FEET? 660 FEET -- WE SHOULD BE FINE. PROBABLY GOING TO RUN 16s OR 17s IN THE BACK AND THEN IN THE FRONT, SO WE'LL PUT BICYCLE TIRES ON THAT THING UP THERE.SWEET. SO, I MEAN, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH NOW, AND WHEN IT'S DONE, IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH THEN, BUT IT DRIVES PRETTY GOOD. SO THAT MOTOR MAKES 60 HORSE, MAYBE. Kaufman: NO. NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS THING RIGHT HERE IS PROBABLY... 30, 40? PROBABLY 25 OR 30 HORSEPOWER.YEAH. Kaufman: SO THE ORIGINAL FLATHEAD FOUR-CYLINDER ON A MODEL "A" IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH POWER, DEFINITELY NEED SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO GO A LOT FASTER, BUT SINCE THE PARTS CUTOFF IS 1952, THAT DOESN'T LEAVE US WITH A WHOLE LOT OF OPTIONS. AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO MAKE THIS, LIKE, A BODIED, INDY-STYLE CAR, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IS WHAT PREDATED WHAT WE COMMONLY KNOW OF AS A DRAGSTER ON IT, AND SO JUST THE GUYS HAVE GOT... THEY'D BUILD THE CARS AS FAST AS THEY'D GO, TAKE THE FOUR-CYLINDER OUT, PUT A V-8 IN IT AND THEN HOPPED IT UP, CARBS HANGING OFF EVERYWHERE, HIGH-COMPRESSION HEADS, AND THEN JUST... AND GOT TO A POINT WHERE THEY WEREN'T GOING ANY FASTER, AND SO THEY SAID, "WELL, LET'S JUST MAKE THEM LIGHTER." SO THEY PULLED THE BODIES OFF, AND THEN THAT BEGAN THE DRAGSTER ERA. LATE '40s INTO EARLY '50s, WE START TO SEE SOME OF THIS EMERGE. BY THE LATE '50s AND EARLY '60s, AS THESE GUYS WERE BUILDING HOT RODS, BASICALLY BUYING THE CHEAPEST, LIGHTEST CARS THEY COULD, USING THESE BIG, POWERFUL MOTORS, YOU START TO HAVE CARS THAT START TO RESEMBLE WHAT WE THINK OF AS A DRAGSTER. THE DRIVER MOVED VERY FAR BACK. THE MOTOR MOVED VERY FAR BACK, THE WHEELBASE GETTING VERY LONG BECAUSE IT HAD ONE, SINGULAR JOB -- ACCELERATE AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. - SUPER-COOL. - SO THIS IS IT. - SO I THINK IT'S GOOD BONES. - I LOVE THOSE PLUG WIRES. OH, I KNOW. I CAN'T STOP! THAT'S THE SKINNIEST SCREECHER I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN. WE'RE WOEFULLY, INADEQUATELY BEHIND ON PARTS TO USE ON THIS THING. IF WE'RE GONNA GO TO A V-8, HE'S GOING TO ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION. WE ARE BACKED UP AGAINST THE WALL. WE'RE IN A SITUATION.WE'RE, LIKE, WEEKS AWAY. ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GONNA PUT SOME TOGETHER FOR THIS? - WELL, WE'RE GOING TO TRY. - OH, REALLY? SO, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S EVER BEEN WRECKED OR ANYTHING, HUH? NO, NO. IT'S REALLY NICE. Kaufman: SO WE'RE ALL REALLY EXCITED ABOUT GOING TO T.R.O.G. WITH MY MOTORCYCLE AND, OF COURSE, THE MODEL "A." - IT RUNS GOOD. - YEAH. - REALLY GOOD. - YEAH, IT DOES. AND ON MOST PROJECTS, WE JUMP RIGHT IN, BUT THIS RAIL DRAGSTER IS A VERY UNUSUAL PROJECT, SO I'VE CALLED AN OLD BUDDY WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE AN EXPERT IN THESE OLD-SCHOOL DRAG CARS. RISE AND SHINE! WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? ¿QUé PASó, SEñOR? HEY, MAN. HOW'S IT GOING, BUDDY? IT'S GOING WELL. HOW ARE THINGS? GOOD TO SEE YOU. VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. GOOD. Ellis: I'VE KNOWN AARON A LONG TIME, AND I INVITED HIM OUT TO THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, AND HE CAME. I SAID, "HERE IS MY CAR. YOU KNOW, GO TAKE IT DOWN THE BEACH," AND I THINK HE GOT THE BUG. I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT BY. I WANTED TO SHOW YOU MY NEWEST ACQUISITION. UH-OH.AND THEN I WAS TALKING WITH MEL, AND HE SAID HE OPENED A NEW CLASS THIS YEAR FOR THE RAIL DRAGSTERS -- MODEL "A," MODEL "T," NO-SHEET-METAL KIND OF THING. OH, SHOOT. YEAH. CONSIDERING HOW CLOSE IT'S COMING UP, I FIGURED THAT WAS ABOUT THE ONLY THING WE COULD GET BUILT IN TIME.WE'RE, LIKE, WEEKS AWAY. ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GONNA PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER FOR THIS? WELL, WE'RE GOING TO TRY.OH, REALLY? NICE. I WENT TO OKLAHOMA, AND I BOUGHT A MODEL "A," AND I KIND OF WANTED TO SEE A COUPLE THINGS -- "A," WHAT YOUR OPINIONS WERE ABOUT THE SITUATION AND, "B," MAYBE IF YOU HAD ANY HEADS UP OR LEADS ON ANY PARTS. YEAH. I THINK I KNOW SOME PEOPLE. I GOT SOME PARTS AND STUFF. - YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT? - YEAH, LET'S GO DO IT. Kaufman: ELROD IS A WALKING ENCYCLOPEDIA WHEN IT COMES TO THESE CARS. - THIS IS IT. - SHOOT, THIS IS NICE. AND HE'S A MEMBER OF THE OILERS, THE CAR CLUB THAT PUTS ON THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN. HE KNOWS QUITE A BIT OF HISTORY WHEN IT COMES TO THIS EVENT. WELL, THE OILERS ARE KIND OF PIONEERS OF DRAG RACING. OKAY. BACK IN 1947, THE OILERS FORMED. MANY OF ITS MEMBERS HAD JUST COME BACK FROM WORLD WAR II. THEY STILL HAD ADRENALINE RACING IN THEIR VEINS, AND SO THEY WERE BASICALLY TRYING TO GET INTO LAND SPEED RACING. MM-HMM. BUT THEY WERE ALSO FREAKIN' 10 HOURS AWAY FROM THE SALT, SO THEY WERE LIKE, "THERE'S GOT TO BE AN EASIER WAY FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BOYS TO DO THIS. LET'S SET UP A DRAG STRIP." AND SUDDENLY, THAT KIND OF CHANGED ALL THE RULES. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A CAR.YEAH. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A WHATEVER. LET'S JUST TRY TO GO AS FAST AS WE CAN IN A 1/4 MILE. THIS KIND OF CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF CREATIVITY, BUBBLE NOSES, JUST A CHAIR WITH THE GUY'S HAIR FLYING IN THE AIR, BUT ALSO, JUST, BASICALLY JUST STRIPPING IT DOWN TO BARE BONES. Ellis: THE OILERS' GLORY DAYS LASTED ABOUT A DECADE, BUT SIX YEARS LATER, EAST COAST ENTHUSIAST MEL STULTZ REVIVED THE CLUB AND CREATED THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THOSE VERY FIRST HOT RODDERS. THE EVENT TAKES PLACE OVER THREE DAYS ON THE JERSEY SHORE, WHERE PURPOSE-BUILT PRE- AND POST-WAR VEHICLES RACE ACROSS THE BEACH AND COMMEMORATE AMERICA'S RICH RACING HERITAGE. THEY COMPETE IN FOUR DIFFERENT CLASSES, BUT THE OVERALL RULES ARE PRETTY SIMPLE. ALL VEHICLES MUST BE AMERICAN MADE AND MODIFIED FOR RACING. CAR BODIES MUST BE OLDER THAN 1935, AND MOTORCYCLES MUST BE OLDER THAN 1948, AND, ABOVE ALL, PAINT AND PARTS MUST RECREATE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THOSE EARLY DAYS OF RACING. IT'S VERY MUCH A PRESERVATION EVENT. THAT'S THE PROBABLY THE BEST WAY I'VE HEARD THAT DESCRIBED, AS A PRESERVATION EVENT.RIGHT. IT'S A LOT OF HISTORY GEEKS THAT ARE REALLY INTO, YOU KNOW, DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY, SO I THINK YOU GOT A GREAT START HERE, MAN. AND THEN, AS NICE AS THIS MOTOR RUNS, AND AS BIG A FAN AS I AM OF BANGERS ON IT, IT'S JUST NOT A V-8. THAT'S -- THAT'S A FACT. RIGHT, AND YOU CAN HAVE A TON OF FUN AT THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN WITH THIS, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO UP THE COMPETITION. AND SO I THINK GOING TO THE FLATHEAD ROUTE, GOING TO V-8 INSTEAD OF FOUR-CYLINDER IS THE WAY TO GO. THE RADIATOR'S SUCH A GOOFY FEATURE ON THE CAR. SURE. LIKE, IF WE DO A SEAT AND THEN DO A WATER TANK BEHIND IT, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THAT? I THINK IT WOULD BE FINE. I MEAN, YOU GOT AN OCEAN RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. IT'S GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF COLD WATER. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I THOUGHT, AS WELL. BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO JUST KEEP GETTING STUCK, KEEP GETTING STUCK. WE HAD A GUY THAT WAS THERE LAST YEAR... HE RAN A WATER TANK? RIGHT. AND HE COULD MAKE ONE OR TWO PASSES AND THEN HAD TO STOP FOR A COUPLE HOURS. YEAH OKAY. YOU COULD DROP THAT WEIGHT, BUT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD OVERHEAT, SO THAT'S A GAMBLE. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH TRANSMISSION ON THIS RIGHT HERE? DO WE NEED TO GO FIND A V-8 TRANSMISSION? YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIND A V-8 TRANSMISSION. Ellis: IF WE'RE GONNA GO TO A V-8, HE'S GOING TO ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION. THE MODEL "A" -- THE PEDALS ARE TOTALLY INTEGRAL TO THE TRANSMISSION HERE. THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER PROBLEM. CHANGING THE TRANSMISSION -- THEN THAT CREATES A PEDAL PROBLEM. THE PEDALS GO AWAY, SO NOW WE'VE GOT TO CREATE PEDALS. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE ACTUALLY KIND OF A TIME SUCK. WHAT'S YOUR TIME FRAME? IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. I THINK HE'S KIND OF NUTS FOR TRYING TO PULL IT IN THIS TIGHT OF A TIME FRAME. JUST KIND OF LET ME KNOW WHAT YOUR SCHEDULE IS OR WHAT YOUR INTERESTED IN COMING DOWN, BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO HAVE SOME INPUT ALONG THE WAY, IF YOU'RE DOWN. OKAY. YEAH, IF YOU WANT SOME HELP PUTTING THIS TOGETHER, I'D BE GLAD TO COME DOWN AND BANG AWAY ON IT. YEAH. THAT WOULD BE COOL. I'M MAYBE NUTS, TOO, FOR COMING DOWN HERE BECAUSE NOW HE'S GOT ME TALKED INTO, "HEY, YOU WANT TO COME MAYBE TURN A COUPLE WRENCHES AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE THIS TRIP TO NEW JERSEY?" NOW WHAT I CAME HERE FOR, YOU WANT TO GO GET SOME LUNCH OR SOMETHING? I'D LOVE TO. LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT. COOL. Ellis: WHAT HE'S STARTING WITH, I THINK, IS A REALLY GREAT FOUNDATION FOR THE RACE OF GENTLEMEN, BUT JUNE IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO IT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT OF FUN. I'LL DIG INTO MY PARTS-ON-LOAN STASH. - THIS AFTERNOON? - THIS AFTERNOON? YOU'VE ALREADY PUT ME TO WORK, RIGHT? - THAT'S RIGHT. - YEAH. Kaufman: I GUESS WE COULD PROBABLY JUST GO AHEAD AND FLIP THIS THING AROUND, THAT WAY, GIVES A LITTLE MORE ROOM TO WORK WITH, AND OBVIOUSLY, THIS STUFF ALL COMES OUT SUPER EASY. STRIP THIS THING DOWN SO IT'S JUST THE FRAME. WE'LL REMOVE THE FRONT BRAKES ON IT, AXLE AND STUFF, AND, YOU KNOW, WE'LL JUST BE DOWN, BASICALLY, TO A FRAME. THIS BUILD IS PRETTY LIGHT, SO BIGGEST THING IS, LIKE I SAID, IS JUST MAKE AS MUCH POWER WITH AS LITTLE CAR AS POSSIBLE. AND SO IN OUR CASE, WE'RE GONNA TRY AND MAKE IT AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE. NO BODY -- THE CLASS ACTUALLY STIPULATES THAT THERE BE NO SHEET METAL, NO BODYWORK ON IT. I ABSOLUTELY ADORE FOUR-CYLINDER BANGER MOTORS, BUT I THINK A V-8 IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO HERE. IT LOOKS BETTER, SOUNDS BETTER, JUST MORE POWER ON TAP, AND SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE MOTOR AND TRANS OUT, MODIFY THE MODEL "A" PEDALS SO THEY HOOK UP WITH THE TRANS. ONE BIG TASK IS THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE THE STEERING TO THE MIDDLE OF THE CAR AS OPPOSED TO HANGING OFF ONE SIDE. IT'S BECAUSE IT LOOKS BETTER. IT MAKES MORE SENSE. NEXT THING IS, WE GET RID OF THE RADIATOR. I'M PLANNING ON USING A WATER TANK ON IT. WE KNOW THAT IT CAUSES TURNAROUND ISSUES, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG, BIG ISSUE, AND IT ALLOWS US TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGHT FURTHER BACK IN THE VEHICLE, WHERE WE NEED IT. EVERYTHING RACING IS ABOUT TRACTION. WHEN IT COMES TO WHEELS AND TIRES, THE FRONTS DON'T MATTER. WE JUST NEED THEM LIGHT. WE'RE GONNA PUT THE BIGGEST TIRE WE CAN IN THE BACK. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND MAKE AS MUCH TRACTION AS WE CAN, AND WE'LL PROBABLY PUT A ROLL BAR ON IT. IT'LL PROBABLY BE VERY CRUDE BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY, THAT'S THE WAY THE GUYS WOULD'VE DONE IT, AND SO WE HAVE TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF MODERN TECHNIQUES WE USE ON IT. YOU JUST WANT TO GO AHEAD AND START TEARING THIS ONE APART? WE CAN. AND SO WE'RE REALLY GONNA PUT THIS THING TOGETHER AS CONSERVATIVELY AS POSSIBLE, THE WAY THE GUYS THAT HAD NO MONEY, AND THEY HAD A TORCH, A HAMMER, AND SOME LEFTOVER SCRAP WOULD'VE DONE. HELL, I'D LOVE TO QUARANTINE OFF A 10x10 GARAGE AND BUILD IT IN IT WITH ONLY THOSE TOOLS. IT'S LIKE, "WE'LL TRY AND DO THINGS." LET ME STIPULATE. WE HAVE ONLY A FEW WEEKS TO GET BOTH THE MOTORCYCLE AND THE MODEL A READY. AND THERE MAY BE A FEW PARTS THAT WE PUT A LITTLE MORE EFFORT INTO AND TRY AND DO AS APPROPRIATELY AS POSSIBLE, BUT IF WE A MODERN TECHNIQUE ON THE CAR, IT'LL LOOK OUT OF PLACE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE TOOLS, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SLOPPY. WE BUILD AS CLEAN AS WE CAN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE STYLE. COME ON. DID THEY HAVE CHERRY PICKERS BACK THEN? WHAT DID THEY USE? A TREE. FRESH OUT OF TREES. WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO EMULATE WHAT WAS DONE BY, YOU KNOW, DECADES AND DECADES AND DECADES AGO, GENERATIONS GONE BY, TO EMULATE WHAT HAD BEEN DONE BY KIDS WERE 15, 17, 18, BUILDING THESE HOT RODS IN THEIR DADS' GARAGES. GUYS HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY, AND THEY'D HOPPED UP THE MOTORS AS FAR AS THEY COULD HOP THEM UP WITH WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME. WHAT THEY UNLEASHED WAS INGENUITY. IT'S VERY AMERICAN. IT'S VERY MUCH US, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE I DON'T THINK WE SEE ENOUGH OF TODAY, IS THAT INGENUITY, THAT JUST MAKE IT WORK, AND SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY THAT. LOOK AT THIS RACE CAR. - VROOM, VROOM! - KEEP PULLING IT. WHAT WAS THE ADVERTISED HORSEPOWER ON THIS ONE? I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE 30 OR 40 SOMETHING. IT'S NOT MUCH. YOU CAN GET THEM ETHANOL, THOUGH. - ETHYL. - ETHYL? - YEAH. - DANG! I BET A LADY BY THE NAME OF ETHEL RODE IN THIS THING AT ONE TIME. - YEAH, REALLY. - I BET A COUPLE OF THEM. -YEAH, NO THANKS. I REALLY WANT THIS CAR TO BE A VERY, VERY TRADITIONAL CAR. THAT BEING SAID, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PARTS. I'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO TO SCROUNGE UP A FEW PARTS IN BETWEEN OUR OTHER BUILDS. WE'RE WOEFULLY, INADEQUATELY BEHIND ON PARTS TO USE ON THIS THING, AND WE ARE BACKED UP AGAINST THE WALL. WE'RE IN A SITUATION, SO WE BETTER FIND THE PARTS WE NEED FAST. SO WE'RE AT THE PATE SWAP MEET TODAY. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND SOME EARLY V-8 STUFF. WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK INSIDE OF THAT, AND IT WAS FULL OF WATER. THAT WASN'T GOING TO WORK FOR US. OH, BOY. IT'S TIGHT. Kaufman: AFTER A FEW ROTATIONS, IT STOPPED, AND THAT'S INDICATIVE OF A VERY NASTY PROBLEM. ALL THIS PAIN IN THE ASS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN ON THE BEACH, RIGHT? YEP. Kaufman: SO WE'RE AT THE PATE SWAP MEET TODAY BECAUSE T.R.O.G. IS COMING UP IN NOT VERY MUCH TIME. I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME EARLY V-8 STUFF RIGHT NOW. - SMALL-BLOCK? - ALL FLATHEAD STUFF. YEAH, YEAH. AND THAT RACE CAR WE'RE BUILDING FOR T.R.O.G. -- WE'RE BUILDING A MODEL "A" DRAGSTER, AND THE PARTS THAT WE'RE AFTER DON'T EXIST IN A CATALOG, AND I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO BUY ANY OF THIS STUFF AFTERMARKET. IT WOULD JUST... IT WOULD LOOK SO WRONG. LOOK AT THAT. AND SO WE COME OUT HERE TO THE SWAP MEET AND FIND STUFF THAT THEY DUG OUT OF THEIR GRANDPA OR THEIR GREAT-UNCLE'S GARAGE OR THEIR BARN AND USE THOSE PARTS TO BUILD OUR CAR. Ellis: YOU FIND EVERYTHING ALREADY? - YEAH. - YEAH? - I'M CARRYING IT, RIGHT? - YEAH, RIGHT, YEAH. YEAH. Kaufman: ELROD HAS AGREED TO MEET ME HERE AND HELP ME TRACK DOWN MODEL "A" PARTS AND, HOPEFULLY, A DECENT FLATHEAD V-8. NOW THE GENESIS OF FORD'S FLATHEAD V-8 GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1932. FORD'S MODEL "A" WAS ONLY AVAILABLE IN FOUR CYLINDERS, AND ALTHOUGH V-8s HAD BEEN AROUND SINCE ALMOST THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPLEXITY AND COSTLY PRODUCTION, THEY WERE ONLY AVAILABLE IN HIGH-END LINES OF CARS. FORD WANTED TO BRING DOWN THOSE COSTS TO REACH A BIGGER MARKET, BUT TO DO SO, HE WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETELY REDESIGN THE V-8 ENGINE. AFTER MUCH TRIAL AND ERROR, IN 1932, HE INTRODUCED THE FORD FLATHEAD V-8. HE WAS ABLE TO KEEP COSTS DOWN BY ENCASING THE INTAKE AND EXHAUST VALVES, AS WELL AS THE CYLINDERS, INTO A SINGLE, ONE-PIECE BLOCK. THE CYLINDER HEAD IS FLAT, HENCE THE NAME FLATHEAD. THE REVOLUTIONARY DESIGN BECAME SO POPULAR IT WAS KEPT IN PRODUCTION UNTIL 1951 AND IS CONSIDERED THE PIONEER OF HOT-ROD ENGINES. Ellis: THE PATE SWAP MEET IS ONE OF THE LARGEST SWAP MEETS IN THE SOUTHWEST. I MEAN, IF IT'S CAR-RELATED, IT SHOULD BE OUT HERE SOMEWHERE. Kaufman: ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE FOUND WALKING AROUND WAS AN INTAKE MANIFOLD FOR THREE CARBURETORS, TWO-BARREL CARBURETORS, STROMBERG 97s. THEY'RE WORKING. THEY LOOKED TO BE SUPER-CLEAN. THEY HAD THE RIGHT PATINA ON ALL OF THEM. Ellis: OH, THIS LOOKS GOOD. - THIS LINKAGE IS AWESOME, TOO. - YEAH. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF HOW IT LOOKS, HOW IT FEELS -- THIS IS THE PART I NEED. YOU'D TAKE 1,200 FOR THIS WHOLE STACK? THE WHOLE STACK, YEAH. I'LL DO THAT. I'LL DO THAT. I APPRECIATE IT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. YES, SIR. SO I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF SMALL BITS AND PIECES FOR THE MODEL "A" DRAGSTER, BUT THAT BEING SAID, THE BIGGEST THINGS I'M LOOKING FOR IS A FLATHEAD V-8 AND TRANSMISSION -- ONE THAT RUNS OR COULD RUN. I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO BUILD A WHOLE MOTOR AND EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH RIGHT NOW. YOU SAID THIS CAME OUT OF A MERCURY? - YEAH. - '51 MERCURY. '51 MERCURY. WE DID FIND ONE FLATHEAD THAT SAT OUT IN THE RAIN ALL DAY YESTERDAY. THIS WOULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE IF IT'S NOT ALL LOCKED UP. - YEAH. - IT WASN'T. - BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT... - YEAH, IT WASN'T THEN. Ellis: IT WAS WET YESTERDAY. Ellis: WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK INSIDE OF THAT, AND IT WAS FULL OF WATER. THAT WASN'T GONNA WORK FOR US. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A RUNNING FLATHEAD? Man: RIGHT THERE -- THAT RIGHT THERE. CAN WE SEE IF IT'S LOCKED UP, IF IT TURNS? YEAH, WE CAN SEE IF IT TURNS. THERE YOU GO. OH, BOY. Kaufman: IT WAS LOCKED UP. IT WOULDN'T ROTATE. THAT MEANS A PISTON OR A RING IS HUNG, OR A BEARING SEIZED IN IT. THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF THINGS, SO THAT'S OFF THE TABLE. ALL THIS PAIN IN THE ASS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN ON THE BEACH, RIGHT? - YEP. - IT'S WORTH IT. Kaufman: Y'ALL KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FLATHEAD? MOST OF THEM ARE STUCK. THIS ONE IS NOT STUCK. - NOPE. - GOOD. COME ON. Ellis: AARON IS PUTTING HIS THUMBS OVER THE SPARK-PLUG HOLES, HOPING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD UP SOME COMPRESSION. IT, LIKE, SNAGS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. Kaufman: AFTER A FEW ROTATIONS, IT STOPPED, AND THAT'S INDICATIVE OF A VERY NASTY PROBLEM. THIS, 100%, WILL LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY. IT JUST WON'T IN THE TIMEFRAME THAT I HAVE. - THANKS, MAN. - THANK YOU. - I APPRECIATE IT. - YOU BET. - WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS. - THANK YOU. SO AFTER RUMMAGING THROUGH THE ENTIRE SWAP MEET, WE CAME AWAY WITH AN INTAKE MANIFOLD, CARBURETORS, AND LINKAGE, BUT OUR HUNT FOR A FLATHEAD V-8, WELL... TODAY IS NOT THE MOTOR DAY. YOU GOT ONE IN THAT '36, MAN. YEAH, I KNOW. I HAVE A '36 FORD THREE-WINDOW, AND AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO NOT TAKE THE MOTOR OUT OF IT, I DO HAVE A RUNNING AND DRIVING FLATHEAD AT HOME THAT I CAN USE IN OUR RACE CAR. SO THAT IS A POSSIBILITY, AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT. IT WAS NOT MY FIRST CHOICE, BUT IT IS A POSSIBILITY. Ellis: IT RUNS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD TAKE OUT AND BRING DOWN TO THE SHOP AND PUT IN THIS CHASSIS. I THINK THAT'S THE WAY TO GO. MAYBE THAT'S JUST THE ANSWER, AS MUCH AS I DON'T WANT... YOU KNOW, I'M... THAT'S PROBABLY THE RIGHT ANSWER. Kaufman: I REALLY DIDN'T PLAN ON CANNIBALIZING ANY OF MY STUFF TO DO ANY OF THIS, BUT WE'RE WOEFULLY, INADEQUATELY BEHIND ON PARTS TO USE ON THE MODEL "A," AND SO THAT BEING THE CASE, YOU KNOW, PARTS ARE WHERE YOU FIND THEM, AS IT TURNS OUT, SOME OF THEM ARE HERE. I BOUGHT A '36 THREE-WINDOW FORD, AND I REALLY WANT THIS CAR TO BE A VERY, VERY TRADITIONAL CAR. UP! NOW, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS MOTOR TO BE ORIGINAL TO THIS CAR, AND SO THAT BEING THE CASE, I DON'T NEED THE MOTOR. I'M GOING TO BUILD ANOTHER MOTOR, SO WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE DRIVETRAIN OUT OF MY '36. OH, YO, COME ON! COME ON! YOU GOT SO FAT AND LAZY! I'LL TELL YOU THIS -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MOTOR IN MY CAR IS AMAZING OR NOT. IT DOES RUN. I HAVE DRIVEN IT. IT'S A FLATHEAD V-8, AND ON ITS WORST DAY, IT'LL MAKE MORE POWER THAN THAT FOUR-CYLINDER. LITTLE PUSH. - GOOD? - YEAH. Kaufman: IT AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. Kaufman: I OBVIOUSLY GOT A TON OF CRAP IN HERE. BEFORE WE CAN PULL THE V-8 OF THE '36, WE GOT TO CLEAN OUT ABOUT TWO YEARS' WORTH OF JUNK. - SWEET. - WHOA! WHAT YOU GOT? 38 REGULAR. - THERE YOU GO. - DANG! PLENTY OF OLD HOT-ROD MAGAZINES. - THAT'S JUST MUSK. - PULL IT OUT I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT... AAH! THERE'S A CAT! THERE'S TOTALLY A CAT IN THERE! OH, IT'S GONE. IT RAN. COME HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WHAT, BUT I KNOW I JUST SAW A CAT RUNNING AROUND IN THE TRUNK OF MY '36 FORD. OH, YEAH. THERE IT IS. LITTLE, TINY KITTEN. IF THERE'S ONE, THERE'S PROBABLY MANY. YEP, THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE. OH, YEAH. THERE'S TWO OF THEM. - DID YOU FIND MORE CATS? - YEAH. - CATS FOR EVERYONE! - WHO WANTS CATS? - CATS! - DUDE, I WANT A CAT. Kaufman: I-I'M NOT REALLY INTO CATS, BUT I KIND OF FEEL OBLIGATED NOW. - I THINK WE JUST... - ARE THERE MORE IN THERE? I THINK IT'S JUST THEM TWO. SOME GROWN-UP CATS DID SOME GROWN-UP CAT THINGS IN THE BACK OF MY OLD FORD AND MADE SOME BABY CATS. ALL RIGHT. SO I GOT CATS NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM. GIVE THESE TO THE GIRLS? GIVE THEM TO ROBIN. YEAH, Y'ALL CAN DEAL WITH THESE THINGS. OH, THERE'S TWO? ARE THERE ANY MORE? - WE DON'T KNOW. - YEAH. OH, MY GOD. THERE YOU GO. - THERE YOU GO. - OH, MY GOD. THERE YOU GO. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SCARED TO DEATH? - THANKS, BOYS. - HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. - MORE CATS? - YEP. - COME ON. COME ON. - MORE CATS. CATS ON CATS ON CATS. THIS ONE IS THE FAT ONE. - HE'S A LITTLE MORE... - DUDE, HE IS A LITTLE PORKER. MM-HMM! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT -- THE ROUND PART OR THE FACE? -THE EYES. GOOD ENOUGH. WE GOT ALL THE CATS? - GOT ALL THE CATS. - I THINK SO. THERE'S A POWER POLE LAYING ON THE GROUND FROM THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET. I DON'T KNOW IF ONE OF THE TRANSFORMERS GAVE UP AND BROKE THE POLE? IT LOOKED KIND OF LIKE THAT POLE WAS SUPER ROTTED, SO NOW WE'RE WORKING IN THE DARK. BEING WITHOUT POWER DOES KIND OF SCREW UP A FEW THINGS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT WITH NO FANS GOING, IT'S MUGGY UP IN HERE. WE'RE GETTING READY TO PULL THE V-8 ENGINE OUT OF AARON'S '36 FORD SO WE CAN SWAP IT OVER INTO OUR MODEL "A." SORRY, '36. WE'RE STEALING YOUR GUTS. I FEEL LIKE THE FOUR-CYLINDER WEIGHED AS MUCH AS THIS ONE. THE V-8 IS BASICALLY THE SAME LENGTH AS THE ORIGINAL FOUR-CYLINDER WE REMOVED FROM THE MODEL "A," SO IT SHOULD FIT LIKE A GLOVE. YEAH, ROBBING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL. SO... Bowman: THAT'S OKAY. IT'S A LITTLE WATER. Willis: KIND OF CRAZY BECAUSE WHEN HE BOUGHT THIS CAR, HE ACTUALLY TOOK A LOAN FOR THIS CAR, WHICH HE SAID HE NEVER DID BACK THEN, SO THIS CAR KIND OF MEANS A LOT TO AARON. WHEN HE BOUGHT IT, HE ACTUALLY ONLY HAD A BIKE TO RIDE, ALSO, SO INSTEAD OF GOING OUT AND BUYING A NICE DAILY DRIVER, YOU KNOW, HE SOUGHT AFTER A '36. THIS IS WHAT HE FOUND, SO PULLING THE MOTOR OUT OF IT, I THINK, IS KIND OF THE FIRST STEP TO THIS CAR BECOMING WHAT HE WANTS BUT ALSO KIND OF HEARTBREAKING, SEEING THE MOTOR COME OUT OF, YOU KNOW, THE CAR THAT HE WANTED FOR SO LONG. THIS IS NOTHING OUT OF THE REGULAR PRACTICE. PEOPLE PUT THESE MOTORS IN THESE CHASSIS DAILY. TOO CLOSE? YEAH, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. Webster: THAT ENGINE, SINCE IT'S NOT THE STOCK POWER PLANT, HE NEEDS SOME CUSTOM MOTOR MOUNTS, SO I'M GOING TO USE SOME OLD TECHNIQUES TO FABRICATE A NEW SET. ANYTHING THAT CAN MAKE YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THESE FANCY TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME JOB, THAT'S NICE. NOW, SINCE WE'RE NOT USING ANY SHEET METAL, THESE MOTOR MOUNTS WILL BE QUITE VISIBLE. AND ALTHOUGH T.R.O.G.'S RULES DON'T PROHIBIT US FROM USING MODERN TOOLS, THEY DO WANT ALL OF THE PARTS TO APPEAR AS ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE. I'M USING THE ACETYLENE TORCH TO CUT THROUGH THIS METAL, A PROCESS THAT WAS ACTUALLY INVENTED IN 1903 AND HASN'T REALLY CHANGED MUCH SINCE THEN. BOOM. Willis: WHILE JEREMY IS MAKING THE MOTOR MOUNTS, I'M OVER HERE ASSESSING THE AXLE THAT WE GOT AT THE SWAP MEET. IT ALREADY HAS A DROP, WHICH MAKES THE CAR SIT LOWER. THE GUY THAT SOLD IT TO US SAID IT HAD A BOW IN IT, SO WE KNEW THAT GOING IN. IT'S ONLY GOING DOWN THE SAND. WE DIDN'T REALLY CARE TOO MUCH FOR IT TO BE PERFECTLY STRAIGHT. WE WILL GET IT AS STRAIGHT AS WE CAN BEFORE PUTTING IT ON THE CAR. Bowman: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. OF COURSE. THE MOMENT WE ALL GET INTO A GROOVE TACKLING OUR LONG TO-DO LIST FOR THE MODEL "A," THE POWER GOES OUT. SO WE WANDERED OUTSIDE, AND THERE'S A POWER POLE LAYING ON THE GROUND FROM THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET. I DON'T KNOW IF ONE OF THE TRANSFORMERS GAVE UP AND BROKE THE POLE. IT LOOKED, LIKE, KIND OF LIKE THE POLE WAS SUPER ROTTED, SO NOW WE'RE WORKING IN THE DARK, AND IT SEEMS LIKE SINCE IT GOT DARK, IT GOT WARMER IN HERE. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THOUGH, AARON WANTS US TO USE OLD-SCHOOL TECHNIQUES, SO THIS IS RIGHT UP HIS ALLEY. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY. Willis: JEREMY STARTED THE MOTOR MOUNTS HERE. I THINK HE'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THOSE, WITH, LIKE, A LITTLE BOX THAT KIND OF HUGS THE UPPER FRAME LIP. YEAH, THERE'S THE... STRAIGHT UP, THEY'RE SUPER JAZZY, BUT, YEAH, ROCK THEM. Bowman: DO YOU WANT RUBBER IN THESE MOUNTS... NO. ...OR JUST SOLID -- NO, RACE CAR. RACE CAR. AND THEN THE WATER-TANK- OR-RADIATOR SITUATION, MAN, TO BE HONEST, I HATE LOOKING AT THAT THING UP THERE. ULTIMATELY, LIKE, IT'S NOT SUPER HOT OUT THERE. LIKE, IT'S RIGHT... SO THE OFFSHORE BREEZE, AND THERE'S... I MEAN, LET'S PROCEED LIKE WE'RE GOING TO RUN A WATER BOX AND NOT A RADIATOR ON IT. I HATE THE LOOK OF THE RADIATORS ON THEM WITHOUT A GRILLE SHELL. I JUST THINK IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU REMOVED THE BODY OFF A CAR. SO WATER BOXES, WHERE WE KIND OF FIND THEIR POPULARITY... SO IN TIME-TRIAL CARS, SO, LIKE, WHEN, LIKE, EL MIRAGE, BONNEVILLE, SINCE THE VEHICLES ARE MADE FOR ONE USE, ONE THING, THE ENGINE WILL ONLY CONSUME SO MUCH WATER, AND EVEN IF IT IS CYCLING, IT'S CYCLING AT SUCH A RATE THAT IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO HEAT ALL THE WATER UP, SO IF WE'RE ONLY RACING THIS THING SHORT PERIODS OF TIME WITH LARGE COOL-DOWN INTERVALS IN BETWEEN, THEN WE CAN REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF HAVING A RADIATOR UP THERE, AND SO IT ALLOWS US TO REMOVE AN AWKWARD PIECE THAT, "A," LOOKS WEIRD AND... "B," IT LOOKS WEIRD. SO THERE'S THAT, AND JON WILL GET SOME ALL THREAD, AND THEN WE'LL GET TO FLIPPING THE SPRINGS. Willis: MODEL As SIT REALLY TALL. WHEN YOU PULL THE BODIES OFF, AND YOU PULL THE FENDERS OFF, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE CAR IS, LIKE, ALMOST LIKE A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE, IT'S SO TALL. SO ANYWHERE WHERE WE CAN GAIN A LITTLE BIT WITHOUT BUYING NEW, WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. SINCE OUR SPRING PACK IS NORMALLY BOLTED TOGETHER LIKE THIS TO WHERE YOUR BOLT IS ON THE LOWER SIDE OF THE SPRING, SO BY TAKING THE SPRING PACK APART, WE CAN PULL THE MAIN LEAF OUT, FLIP IT OVER, BRING IT BACK IN. NOW THAT JUST, PUT YOUR BOLT ON THE TOP, SO WE'LL RE-ARCH THIS LOWER SPRING TO MATCH THE REST OF THE PACK. THAT'S THE EASIEST WAY TO LOWER A MODEL "A." PUT THE BOLT THROUGH AND GET THIS ONE READY. WE'RE BASICALLY GOING TO THREAD A NUT ONTO THIS LONG BOLT THAT WE RAN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE LEAF PACK TO TIGHTEN THE SPRING INTO A SINGLE ARC. IF THAT ONE PUTS UP A REALLY HUGE FIGHT, WE MAY GO AHEAD AND RELAX THAT ONE. ONCE IT'S ALL TIGHTENED DOWN, WE'LL JUST CUT OFF THE EXCESS LENGTH OF THE BOLT. 3-INCH INCISION. YEAH. - OH. - WHAT IS THAT? - IT'S BACK ON. - FANS, NOW! Kaufman: BACK TO WORK, CHIL'REN. Willis: LEAF-SPRING SUSPENSION HAS BEEN IN USE SINCE THE MID-18th CENTURY WHEN IT WAS USED ON CARRIAGES IN ENGLAND. IT'S EVEN IN USE TODAY ON HEAVIER VEHICLES, LIKE TRUCKS AND VANS AND SUVs. I JUST WANT TO CHECK THIS OUT, SO I JUST GOT TO... I'M GOING TO BUMP THESE A LITTLE BIT. I'D GO AHEAD AND HIT THAT WITH HEAT AND GET IT TO CONFORM, YOU KNOW, AND JUST THE ONE THING IS JUST REALLY KEEPING IT EVEN BECAUSE A HOT SPOT WILL CAUSE A KINK ON IT. - YEAH. - TRY AND MELLOW THOSE OUT. TRY AND HEAT IT UP, MELLOW THEM, AND GET THAT TO CONFORM. HOW HOT DO YOU TAKE IT? UNTIL IT CHANGES COLOR, IT WON'T MOVE. - SO ORANGE? - ORANGE, YEAH. I HAVEN'T USED A TORCH SINCE, LIKE, HIGH SCHOOL. THERE WE GO. Willis: IT'S PRETTY AMAZING HOW THE MECHANICS, THE PHYSICS, AND THE TECHNOLOGY HASN'T REALLY CHANGED IN THE LAST 100 YEARS OF HOW WE WORK ON THESE CARS BESIDES MAYBE SOME IMPROVEMENTS FOR EFFICIENCY. PRESTO! Kaufman: I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT TO T.R.O.G. A FEW YEARS AGO. THEY'RE KNOWN FOR NOT SEALING WELL. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THIS ONE DIDN'T SEAL WELL. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S SPARKING. I DON'T EVEN... OH, COME ON. OH, YOU PIECE OF CRAP. ARCLIGHT CAN BE VERY DEMANDING, SO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES, AND THAT MEANS STICKING TO A STRICT NUTRITIONAL DIET... THAT'S BOMB. ...AND MAKING SURE YOU'RE ALWAYS HYDRATED. AN EXERCISE ROUTINE IS A MUST, SO WE WORK OUT WHENEVER POSSIBLE... WHAT YOU GOT? KEEP YOUR ELBOWS TUCKED IN. - OH, LIKE THIS? - AND KEEP PUSHING. TWENTY. THINK OF EVERYONE THAT'S EVER MADE FUN OF YOU. Bowman: ...WHETHER IT'S LIFTING WEIGHTS OR JUST GOING FOR A BIKE RIDE. JUST KNOW THAT THE ENTIRE CREW IS IN TIP-TOP SHAPE SO THAT WE CAN ALWAYS BRING OUR "A" GAME. AAAAAH! - QUICK MOCK UP? - YEAH. DO WE WANT TO THROW THIS ON THE AXLE FIRST OR... SAME AMOUNT OF PROBLEM BOTH WAYS. YEAH. TODAY, WE'LL GET A LOOK AT HOW THE FRONT-END COMPONENTS AND THE MOTOR ARE GOING TO FIT TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ONCE WE PUT ALL OF THESE PIECES, SOME OF THEM FROM THE SWAP MEET, SOME OF WE HAVE ALTERED... AND FIND OUT HOW THEY ALL LIVE TOGETHER. YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A GOOD SIGHT DOWN THAT AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK. YEAH, NO. I KNOW IT'S SCREWED UP. Kaufman: THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN ALL OF YOUR BRILLIANT IDEAS ON PAPER SUDDENLY BECOME REALITY AND MAYBE WON'T WORK OUT AS WELL AS YOU THOUGHT. Kaufman: HEY, I THINK WE MAY NEED TO LOWER THE MOTOR DOWN. HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO GO? I'D LIKE TO GET THAT CRANK KIND OF IN LINE WITH THIS, AND THE TIE ROD IS PROBABLY GOING TO RUN INTO THE FRAME NOW. - WE ARE. - I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO HERE IS, WE'LL MAKE A STEERING ARM FOR IT, YOU KNOW, AND SO WE'LL MOVE THE STEERING ARM FOR IT. THE ONE THING THAT I THINK ABOUT IS ON THE CASTER, THOUGH, IT CAUSES THE TIE ROD TO FALL DOWN AND LIFT, SO I THINK WE'RE IN A HOLDING PATTERN ON THE MOCK-UP RIGHT HERE, AND THEN LET'S GET THE REAR END TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON BACK THERE. SO THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME WE KIND OF GET IT ALL TOGETHER. MOCKING EVERYTHING UP IS A PRETTY IMPORTANT PROCESS ON A BUILD LIKE THIS... - ALL RIGHT. YOU READY? - YEAH, THAT'S IT. GO AHEAD. ...BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NOT A SINGLE PART THAT'S GOING TO BE LEFT STOCK. THE LINE UP IS BAD ON THE... IT'S SPENT? PUSH, PUSH, PUSH. YAY. BUT IN OUR SPECIFIC CASE, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE SO FAR IS GOING TO NEED SOME ADJUSTMENT, FROM THE MOTOR MOUNTS TO THE LEAF SPRINGS. Willis: THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WEIGHT. FOR WHAT? TO GET THE SPRINGS CLOSE TO THE SHACKLE. THIS THING HAS STILL GOT SO MUCH CURL IN IT, IT'S NOT... YEAH, WE'RE STILL, LIKE, - 6 INCHES AWAY. - THAT'S 6 INCHES OFF. COMPRESS IT SOME MORE. SO IT'S NOT OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO HAVE TO MAKE SMALL CHANGES TO GET EVERYTHING WORKING PROPERLY, BUT IT IS TIME-CONSUMING. WITH T.R.O.G. ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS AWAY, WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR BIG ERRORS. Kaufman: WHERE'S THE LITTLE PRY BAR SO I CAN TURN THAT THING OUT? HERE. WE JUST FIGHTING THAT ONE SPRING. WHERE'S RUSS WHEN WE NEED HIM? - JUST TO SIT ON THE... - JUST TO SIT ON THIS THING. YEAH. Kaufman: SO THE DEAL IS, LIKE, IT RAN WHEN I BROUGHT IT UP HERE, SO I'M JUST GOING TO... I'M GOING TO FIRE IT BACK UP, SO IF YOU TWO GUYS GRAB THE FRONT OF IT, ONE ON EACH SIDE, AND WE'LL GRAB THE BACK OF IT HERE, AND JUST WHEEL IT BACKWARDS. - UNO, DOS, TREES. - YEP. Kaufman: SO BASED ON THE TEST FITTING WE DID YESTERDAY, THE GUYS HAVE THE MARCHING ORDERS ON THE MODEL "A." THAT'S IT. IT'S REALLY AN OLD MILITARY BIKE. YOU COULD JUST PUSH IT RIGHT OFF THERE, AND IT WOULD PROBABLY SURVIVE. MOST LIKELY WOULD. AND WHILE THEY DO THAT, I FIGURED I'D DIG OUT MY HARLEY-DAVIDSON WLA '45. I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT TO T.R.O.G. A FEW YEARS AGO, BUT I DIDN'T EVEN OPEN THIS THING UP TILL LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE TIME TO BE THERE, RIGHT? AND I HAD NEVER HAD A '45 BEFORE, SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN IT, NOT IN IT, WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE, NOT LOOK LIKE, SO I KIND OF... I PUT IT TOGETHER IN THIS SHAPE, LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE, BUT WHEN I GOT IT TOGETHER, THESE THINGS HAVE THREADED NIPPLES FOR THE INTAKE, AND THEY'RE KNOWN FOR NOT SEALING WELL. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THIS ONE DIDN'T SEAL WELL. AND I COULDN'T GET IT STARTED FOR THE LIFE OF ME. I WORKED ALL NIGHT LONG. I GAVE UP 10:30, 11:00 IN THE MORNING AND SAID, "I GOT TO BE GONE." I EVENTUALLY DID GET IT RUNNING. SHE'S A SPITTER. BUT I SERIOUSLY REGRET NOT HAVING IT READY FOR T.R.O.G. GOOD ENOUGH. - RUN FOR MILES ON THAT, HUH? - MM-HMM. NOW, T.R.O.G. ONLY ALLOWS VEHICLES TO ENTER IF THEY'RE AMERICAN MADE, AND YOU DON'T GET ANYMORE AMERICAN THAN HARLEY-DAVIDSON. IN 1901, 20-YEAR-OLD WILLIAM HARLEY STRAPPED A SMALL GAS ENGINE TO A BICYCLE FRAME. WITHIN TWO YEARS, HE AND HIS CHILDHOOD FRIEND, ARTHUR DAVIDSON, FOUNDED HARLEY-DAVIDSON TO MAKE WHAT THEY CALLED A MOTOR BICYCLE. THE REST, AS THEY SAY, IS HISTORY, AS HARLEY-DAVIDSON IS NOW CONSIDERED A QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN ICON. AS FOR MY HARLEY, IT'S BEEN SITTING A BIT, SO THIS TIME, JUST IN CASE, I'M NOT WAITING UNTIL THE LAST SECOND TO GET HER GOING. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S SPARKING. I DON'T EVEN... OH, YEAH. OH, COME ON. WHEN IT COMES TO MY LITTLE HARLEY, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. HOWEVER, I'VE BUILT IT. I'VE RIDDEN IT, SO THIS TIME, I'M OPTIMISTIC. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT -- WHEN IT COMES TO OLD BIKES... OH, YOU PIECE OF CRAP. ...YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET. NEXT WEEK, WE CONTINUE TO PREP FOR T.R.O.G. OH, YEAH. THE HARLEY... YEAH. I'M GONNA DRIVE IT AROUND THE STREET, SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ...AND THE MODEL A... HOLY CRAP. - IT MOVES. - BRACE FOR IT. Kaufman: ...AREN'T SHOWING ANY FAVORS. OH, BRAKES. THERE'S NO BRAKES, 100%. 100% NO BRAKES. I'M GOING TO GO CRY IN THE CORNER.
