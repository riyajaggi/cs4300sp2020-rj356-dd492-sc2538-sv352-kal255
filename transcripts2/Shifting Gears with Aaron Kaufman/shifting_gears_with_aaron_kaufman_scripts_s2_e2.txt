 Kaufman: I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW, I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HANDPICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL,

 AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST. I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." THREE, TWO, ONE, GO. TONIGHT, I CONTINUE TO PUSH MYSELF HARDER THAN EVER FOR THE UPCOMING OLYMPUS RALLY. HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT THOSE LAPS? I THINK THEY WERE ALL A BIG MESS. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE ON EVERY SINGLE THING. Kaufman: WE DROP OUR SUBARU OFF FOR PAINT JOB TO A FAMILIAR FACE. WHAT, ARE Y'ALL SCARED OF YOUR CAGE? VERY. WE HAVE TO HANDLE THAT CAGE LIKE GLASS. OKAY.

 Kaufman: BUT WHEN WE PICK IT UP, WE DISCOVER SOME DEVASTATING NEWS. DAVE, THEY'RE NOT WELDED ALL THE WAY AROUND. - OH, NO.. - SAME THING OVER HERE. DUDE, THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL THAT WILL PASS ANY KIND OF TECH. OH, MY GOD. Kaufman: AND OUR BUILDERS HAVE A HEAVY WEIGHT TO BEAR. AH, SON OF A BITCH, MAN. I REALLY HATE DROPPING THE BALL. OUR CAGE WON'T PASS TECH. THIS IS THE WORST SETBACK THAT I HAVE HAD IN MY CAREER. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS SO HERE'S WHERE WE'RE AT. A FEW WEEKS AGO, I DECIDED THE TEAM WOULD BUILD A RACE CAR, AND I WOULD COMPETE IN MY VERY FIRST RALLY. THE FIRST STEP WAS FINDING A SUBARU IMPREZA RS, WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE RIGHT CAR AND APPROPRIATE FOR MY LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE, WHICH IS TO SAY, ALMOST NONE. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND TOO MUCH WE'RE MAKING IT A RACE CAR. NO, NO, NOT AT ALL. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS TO BUILD A RACE CAR THAT CAN STAND UP TO THE PUNISHMENT OF RALLY RACING. I DECIDED THAT MY FIRST RACE WOULD BE THE OLYMPUS RALLY, A TWO-DAY EVENT WHERE DRIVERS, WITH THE HELP OF A CODRIVER, WILL COMPETE IN TIME-STAGED RACES FOR A TOTAL OF 200 MILES THROUGH THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OF WASHINGTON STATE. MY JOB RIGHT NOW IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD -- UPGRADE THE DRIVER. AND THAT MEANS MORE TRAINING AT RALLY READY. AND THAT ALSO MEANS RELYING ON MY MECHANICS BACK AT THE SHOP TO KEEP THE SUBARU BUILD ON TRACK. AND COME UP JUST A LITTLE TOUCH. - OW, MY FINGER. - COME IN FOR THAT. YOU DUMMY. THERE WE GO. - THERE IT IS. - FITS ON. THAT IS GANGSTER. WE GOT A LOT OF THINGS DONE ON THE SUBARU WHILE AARON HAS BEEN OUT WORKING ON HIS DRIVING SKILLS, THE BIGGEST AND THE MOST TIME-CONSUMING OF WHICH WAS THE FINAL WELDING ON THE ROLL CAGE. BASICALLY, IN ORDER TO GET THE APPROVAL NEEDED TO RUN THIS CAGE IN AN OFFICIAL RALLY EVENT, WE HAD TO WELD UP A LITTLE WELD SAMPLE THEY SENT, AND WE HAD TO SEND THAT BACK PRIOR TO BEING ABLE TO WELD ON THE CAGE, AND THE SAMPLE WAS APPROVED WITH THE CONDITION THAT THE ONE PERSON THAT WELDS THAT WELD SAMPLE IS THE ONLY PERSON ALLOWED TO WELD ON THE CAGE. BY CHANCE OF LUCK, I WAS THE ONE THAT WELDED THAT, SO I GOT STUCK IN ALL THE AWKWARD POSITIONS, WELD THE ENTIRE CAGE. TOMORROW, WHEN AARON GETS BACK, HE'S GOING TO GIVE IT ONE LAST ONCE-OVER, BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY STOUT AND SEEMS LIKE THERE WON'T BE ANY ISSUE THERE. BUT UNTIL THEN, WE GOT TO KEEP THE BUILD MOVING FORWARD. I'M GONNA GET ON FIXING THAT LITTLE WRINKLE. JEREMY IS GOING TO MAKE SEAT BELTS. ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'LL FINISH PUTTING ONE OF THESE HUBS TOGETHER. GOOD GAME. - WE GOT A COUPLE HOURS TODAY. - MM-HMM. WHAT ARE YOU FEELING? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO WORK ON? WHAT DID YOU SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT I NEED TO WORK ON? LAST I WAS WATCHING, WE'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT TOO HANDSY. - MM-HMM. YEP. - SO JUST A LITTLE BIT, LIKE -- THERE'S A FEW TIMES THAT WE'LL SEE YOU. YOU'LL TURN IN. THE CAR WILL START TO ROTATE. YOU'LL COUNTERSTEER, AND YOU'LL TURN IN, AND YOU'LL COUNTERSTEER. - YEAH. Carapetyan: SO AARON CALLED ME A FEW WEEKS AGO AND ASKED ME TO BASICALLY TEACH HIM EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD ABOUT RALLY RACING BEFORE OLYMPUS, SO I CALLED MY GOOD BUDDY, BUCKY LASEK, WHO HAS BEEN A PRO RACER FOR A FEW YEARS, TO COME HELP GET AARON READY TO RIP. YESTERDAY, AARON RAN A BASELINE LAP HERE AROUND OUR POND LOOP RALLY STAGE AT RALLY READY AND PUT IN A TIME OF 49 SECONDS. WATCHING AARON RUN THAT LAP, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. NOW THAT WE HAVE A BASELINE WITH THE 49 FLAT, LET'S JUST SEE, YOU KNOW, PULL SOME TIME OUT OF THAT AND WORK ON YOUR HANDS JUST A LITTLE BIT. Carapetyan: SO TODAY AND OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WHILE AARON'S DOWN HERE, WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FOCUS ON A HANDFUL OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES THAT'LL HELP HIM SHAVE SOME TIME OFF AND IMPROVE ON THAT 49-SECOND BASELINE. LET'S GO DO IT THEN. I'LL GRAB A HELMET, AND I'LL HOP IN WITH YOU. OKAY. Carapetyan: EVENTUALLY, AARON'S GONNA HAVE TO FIND A PROFESSIONAL CODRIVER, BUT FOR THE TIME BEING, HE'LL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH ME. OH, YEAH. SHE'S A LITTLE DUSTY. REACH WITH YOUR RIGHT. HOVER WITH YOUR LEFT. REACH WITH YOUR LEFT. HOVER WITH YOUR RIGHT. I'M JUST GONNA DO IT FOR YOU. REACH WITH YOUR RIGHT. HOVER WITH YOUR LEFT. THERE YOU GO, EXACTLY, PERFECT. STRAIGHTEN OUT. STRAIGHTEN OUT. STRAIGHTEN OUT. STRAIGHTEN OUT. STRAIGHTEN OUT. STRAIGHTEN OUT. THERE YOU GO. WE CAME INTO THE WEEKEND REALLY FOCUSING ON HIS HANDS AND FOCUSING ON GETTING HIS TIMING EARLY. BUCKY NOTED THAT HE SEEMED TO BE REALLY LATE ON A LOT OF HIS INPUTS. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF WHEEL. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET YOUR TIMING ON THE TURNING OKAY, BUT YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE UNWINDING IT. THE FIRST HALF, I'D SAY, WHEN I GOT IN WITH HIM, WE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS THERE. EASY ON THE BRAKE. GOOD. THAT LOOKED BETTER. LET'S JUST KEEP THIS PARTY GOING, AND I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR STEERING. YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO THAT. I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT VISUAL CUES. ALL RIGHT. NOW WE REALLY DO NEED TO START TO WORK ON NOT JUST TIGHTENING UP HIS INPUTS, BUT STARTING TO LOOK AT WHERE TO BE PUTTING THE CAR, A LITTLE BIT MORE THE RACECRAFT AND THE RACE-LINE STUFF. LOOK AT THE NEXT CONES, LOOKING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE STRAIGHTAWAY. I WAS SENDING VISUAL CUES IN THE CAR WITH HIM, SO AS WE'D COME THROUGH A CORNER, I WOULD POINT UP, AND I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, "EYES ON THE FILM CREW. EYES ON THE MINIVAN. EYES ON THE OIL TRUCK." EYES THROUGH THE CORNER LOOKING AT THOSE BARRIERS. SO HE WOULD UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW FAR AHEAD MY EYES ARE WHEN I'M DRIVING, AND THAT'S WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE WORKING TOWARDS. LOOKING AT BUCKY. VISUAL CUES WERE HUGE FOR HIM, I THINK. PERFECT, ALL RIGHT. EYES AND HANDS, 100 TIMES BETTER. THAT FELT BETTER. THAT MADE SENSE. Kaufman: IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE ON EVERY SINGLE THING THAT WE'VE TRIED TO LEARN. ALL RIGHT. Kaufman: I DON'T KNOW WHAT PART OF MY BRAIN THAT IS THAT CAUSES THAT, OR IF IT'S, YOU KNOW, AN ATTITUDE THING, OR IF IT'S PHYSICALLY, MY BRAIN IS JUST PROCESSING IT WRONG OR NOT AT THE RIGHT TIME, BUT I FEEL LIKE TODAY THAT WE REALLY GOT ENOUGH THINGS TO START TO CLICK. I'M HAPPY, AGAIN, WITH THE PROGRESS. I DO THINK WE SHOULD DO SOME TIMED LAPS FOR YOU NOW, AND WE SHOULD BOTH BE OUT OF THE CAR 'CAUSE I'M COMFORTABLE NOW. I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. I THINK THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA. SWEET-ASS, DUDE. IF WE CAN BEAT A 49, I'LL BE REALLY HAPPY 'CAUSE WE BEAT 49 WITH HIS HANDS SHUFFLING MORE. - YEAH. - IT'D BE GREAT. Carapetyan: AARON, YOU ABOUT READY? GIVE ME A GOOD REV IF YOU'RE READY TO GO. YOU GUYS READY? THREE, TWO, ONE, GO. EASY IN THIS PART. EASY IN THIS TIME. HOLD IT A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER, LESS SLIDING. AND THERE YOU GO. AND ACROSS THE LINE. THAT WAS BETTER. I WAS LIKE, IF WE CAN GET HIM NEAR A 46 NOW, THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE HIS HANDS WERE A MESS, AND HE'S STILL SO FOCUSED ON HIS HANDS AND HE'S AT 44. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY TELL HIM THAT HE JUST RAN A 44.6. - I AGREE. WE'LL JUST WATCH HIM IN HIS NATIVE HABITAT HERE, OVERTHINKING EVERY INPUT WHILE HE SITS AT THE START LINE FESTOONING IN A POOL OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS. - SHOULD WE JUST SEND HIM NOW? - YEAH. 'CAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD JUST COUNT HIM DOWN. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING, JUST DO -- - JUST RIGHT NOW, READY? - YEAH. FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, GO. YEAH, HE'S LIKE, "AH! WHAT, NOTHING!" YEAH, HE'S GOING TO -- THAT'S THE FINISH LINE. - YEAH. - EVERYBODY, IF WE COULD -- GET OFF THE FINISH LINE. GOOD, TIGHTY, TIGHTY, TIGHTY, TIGHTY, TIGHTY. OH, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. SO A SECOND SLOWER, BUT THAT LOOKED REALLY GOOD THROUGH THERE. LOOK AT THAT. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. THAT LOOKS GOOD. NICE. USE THE WHOLE TRACK. HE'S LINKING THAT OVER THAT CREST SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER NOW. THERE WE GO. THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. BACK IN THE 44s. LET'S HAVE HIM PULL BACK UP. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO AHEAD AND PULL IT ON IN. HEY, A-A-RON. HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT THOSE LAPS? I DON'T THINK ONE OF THEM WAS WORTH ANYTHING. I THINK THEY WERE ALL A BIG MESS. I'M OFF MY LINE. I'M OFF MY PACE AND EVERYTHING, AND SO I TRY AND GET THE CAR SETTLED AGAIN, LIKE, LONG RIGHT, AND THEN FROM THERE, HE'S LIKE, "COME TO THIS CORNER." IT'S, LIKE, I MESS IT UP. THAT LAP'S BAD. I CAN'T RECOVER THAT. I MEAN, I WOULD REALLY HATE TO LIVE IN YOUR HEAD, SEEMS LIKE A REALLY ROUGH PLACE. WHEN AARON COMES IN, HE'S LIKE, "YOU KNOW, I JUST -- "MAN, I'M PRETTY SURE I WAS 10 SECONDS SLOWER "THAN ANYBODY EVER AND PRETTY MUCH USELESS, AND I PROBABLY SHOULD NEVER DRIVE A CAR AGAIN." SO LET'S JUST TALK LAP TIMES. YOU'RE NOT FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT YOUR RESULTS. WHAT ARE YOUR GUESSES FOR LAP TIMES? 47.5, 48, THAT RANGE. MY FASTEST TIME TODAY WASN'T RACE PACE. MAYBE I'M HUSTLING THE CAR HERE AND THERE. MAYBE WE'LL GET SOME GOOD WORK DONE, BUT IT AIN'T THAT SPEED. I WASN'T ON THE LINE ON ONE SINGLE CORNER, SO I'D BE WILLING TO BE THAT ONE OF THOSE WAS A PLUS 50. I MEAN, I'LL JUST SHOW YOU. PRETTY DECENT TIME. THAT WAS YOUR LAST LAP. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT. YEAH, SO REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU EARLIER -- IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT AT ALL. REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU EARLIER ABOUT -- THIS IS, LIKE, WE NEED TO HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE COUNSELING SHOW FOR THIS, BUT THE PROBLEM, DUDE, IS YOU'RE GETTING TO WHERE EVERY LAP YOU'RE IMPROVING, BUT THE PROBLEM IS, ALL YOU'RE SEEING IS, THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE, AND THIS IS WHERE YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD GET. THE ONE THING THAT HAS JUST BEEN ME MY WHOLE LIFE IS I'M REALLY, REALLY AFRAID TO TELL MYSELF, LIKE, "YOU DID OKAY," OR, LIKE, "YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH," OR "THINGS ARE WORKING." I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. I KNOW I CAN GO FASTER. I KNOW I CAN GET THIS BETTER, AND IF I TELL MYSELF, "YOU DID A GOOD JOB," LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. YOU'RE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE, "MAN, LOOK HOW MUCH I CAN IMPROVE STILL." - YEAH. SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS BIG DISPARITY AND THIS BIG DELTA BETWEEN WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO, INSTEAD OF SAYING, "HEY, WOW. I'M HERE, AND I STARTED DOWN HERE." HE'S GOT A HISTORY OF BEING SUCH A HEAD CASE, I THINK, IN THE CAR. IT'S JUST GONNA BE -- YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO JUST CONSTANTLY, IT'S, LIKE, CONSTANT AFFIRMATION THAT, "HEY, LET'S NOT FOCUS ON WHERE YOU AREN'T YET. LET'S FOCUS ON WHERE YOU'VE GOTTEN FROM WHERE YOU STARTED." DO YOU THINK DR. PHIL IS AVAILABLE AROUND OLYMPUS TIME? I CAN TEXT HIM. I'M EXCITED FOR YOU TO SEE THAT YOU PULLED FIVE SECONDS OUT IN TWO HOURS TODAY, BASICALLY, OR, I MEAN, AT LEAST TWO. LIKE, I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE ADDING THE STUFF AND THEN SEEING A RESULT FROM IT. AND, LIKE, AND QUITE HONESTLY, I REALLY NEEDED TO SEE THAT 'CAUSE I FELT LIKE THOSE WERE GOING SLOWER. I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING BACKWARDS REALLY BAD. I PUT DOWN A MUCH, MUCH, MUCH FASTER LAP TODAY, AND I HATED THE LAP, BUT ULTIMATELY, IT WAS FASTER. THAT'S WHAT BREEDS A RACE CAR DRIVER. YOU CAN'T EVER GET COMPLACENT, BUT DON'T FORGET TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND JUST BE PRESENT IN THE SUCCESS PERIODICALLY. AND SO THAT MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT WE REALLY ARE HEADED THE RIGHT DIRECTION. EVEN THOUGH I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND MY OWN LEARNING CURVE HERE, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NOT WORKING. LET'S FIGURE OUT WHEN TO COME BACK. LET'S GET THE CALENDARS, BOYS. ALL RIGHT, PIVOTAL MOMENT, DOES THE DRIVESHAFT FIT? NO, IT DOESN'T. OH. - SWEET PIECE. - PIECE OF SOMETHING. KC IS GONNA HANDLE THE PAINT JOB FOR US. WHAT, ARE Y'ALL SCARED OF YOUR CAGE? VERY. WE HAVE TO HANDLE THAT CAGE LIKE GLASS. WE GOT FOUR DAYS TO KNOCK THIS OUT, SO WE'RE GONNA GET AFTER IT. SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO PUT A HAND ON IT AND MAKE SURE SHE DON'T SLIDE OFF AND ROLL OVER. - OH, HEY, HEY. - YEE. DID THE CAGE GIVE Y'ALL ANY TROUBLE AT ALL? YEAH, I MEAN, IT FIT NICE. WHEN Y'ALL DROPPED IT DOWN AND PUT IT BACK UP IN THERE, HOW SMOOTH DID THAT GO? - GOOD. - YEAH. - OH, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. SO IN THE TIME I WAS AWAY AT RALLY READY TRAINING FOR THE OLYMPUS RALLY, THE GUYS BACK HERE AT THE SHOP WERE MAKING HEADWAY ON THE SUBARU BUILD. AND THEN I WAS ABLE TO GET UP IN THOSE POUCHES -- - I SAW THAT. - ...PRETTY DECENT. - I SAW THAT. IT LOOKS GOOD, LOOKS REALLY GOOD. AND I TRUST THE GUYS TO DO THINGS RIGHT, OR I WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE LEAVING THEM TO GO TRAIN, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY MANUFACTURER'S APPROVAL PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ON THE ROLL CAGE AND THE FACT THAT IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS MY SAFETY, I DID WANT TO DOUBLE-CHECK THEIR WORK. NO, I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT ONE BIT. I THINK IT'S GONNA WORK REALLY WELL. ROCK 'EM, SOCK 'EM. ABOUT READY TO START PUTTING SOME PARTS BACK ON. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS, AARON SEEMS HAPPY WITH THE ROLL CAGE. THE BAD NEWS IS, WAITING FOR THE CERTIFICATION TO COME IN BACKED US UP ON A LOT OF STUFF. AND THE NAME OF THE GAME RIGHT NOW IS TEST FITTING. THE CAR IS SCHEDULED TO GO TO PAINT IN TWO DAYS, BUT BEFORE IT DOES, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE ALL THE MOUNTS AND BRACKETS ON THE BODY AND CHASSIS ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE 'CAUSE IN ORDER TO FIX ANY OF THOSE ONCE IT'S PAINTED MEANS DAMAGING THE PAINT JOB. OH, MAN, THIS IS LITTLE GUY SEATING. SO WE'RE TEST FITTING THE RACING SEAT TO MAKE SURE OUR SEAT BRACKET IS RIGHT, THE BUMPERS... AY, YI, YI. ...TO MAKE SURE ALL THE MOUNTING TABS ARE CORRECT. GOOD. IT'S GOOD. BASICALLY, ANYTHING THAT'S NOT JUST A SIMPLY BOLT-IN JOB NEEDS TO BE FABRICATED BEFORE THE CAR GOES TO PAINT. WE WERE AT LUNCH AND WE CAME BACK TO SOME GOOD PARTS. OUR DRIVESHAFT SHOWED UP. OUR WILLIS IS MAKING NOISE BACK THERE. HE'S ABOUT TO GET FIRED, AND WHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW IS, I HAVE A KNIFE. ORIGINALLY, WE HAD A TWO-PIECE DRIVESHAFT IN THIS CAR. I WANT TO SAY IT'S PROBABLY MORE FOR COMFORT IN THE FACTORY APPLICATION, YOU KNOW, KEEPING NOISE DOWN AND SUCH, VIBRATIONS, BUT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE NOISE LEVEL OR A LITTLE BIT OF THE VIBRATION THAT A ONE-PIECE DRIVESHAFT MAY CAUSE BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A RACE CAR. GET ON MY DRIVESHAFT AND FLY. THE BENEFITS OF A ONE-PIECE DRIVESHAFT ARE LESS PARTS TO GO WRONG ON A ONE-PIECE DRIVESHAFT, AND IT'S JUST GENERALLY STRONGER. THERE'S OUR FACTORY U-JOINT. SEE HOW IT'S SMALL AND CUTE. NOW IF WE GO OVER TO OUR NEW DRIVESHAFT... LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT. IN THIS CASE, BIGGER IS BETTER. YEAH, IS IT EVEN SERVICEABLE? LIKE, THESE AREN'T EVEN SERVICEABLE. - NO, THESE AREN'T. - THEY HAVE NO CLIPS IN THEM. SO ANOTHER BENEFIT, WE CAN CHANGE IT, CHANGE THE DRIVESHAFT U-JOINT WHEN BEFORE YOU COULDN'T. YOU HAD TO CHANGE THE WHOLE PIECE. YEP. - GET THAT CRAP OUT OF HERE. - JUNK. ALL RIGHT, PIVOTAL MOMENT, DOES THE DRIVESHAFT FIT? - NO, IT DOESN'T. - OH. WAY TO BE OPTIMISTIC. WITH THAT ATTITUDE. BUT NO, IT DOESN'T. WEDGE IT. HOW -- IS IT PRETTY FAR OFF? IT'S LENGTHWISE IS -- IT'S WAY OFF. THE FIRST PROBLEM THAT WE SAW WITH THE DRIVESHAFT IS, IT'S LONG. WE ALSO NOTICED, AFTER GETTING IT INTO PLACE, IT HIT EVERYTHING. I'M WORRIED ABOUT RIGHT HERE, AND I'M ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THAT, IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO OPEN THAT RADIUS UP HIGHER. SO AFTER DOUBLE-CHECKING THAT IT'S SAFE TO DO... WE CAN JUST PUT -- CHOPPED A HALF INCH OFF OF THIS, I BET IT'LL -- YEAH, JUST RIGHT UP TO THE SPLINES. I'M ACTUALLY GONNA TRIM A HALF INCH OFF OF THE PINION SO THE DRIVESHAFT WILL FIT. WHILE I'M DOING THAT, JEREMY IS HAMMERING OUT THE DRIVESHAFT TUNNEL THAT RUNS DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE CAR TO OPEN UP SOME MORE CLEARANCE AROUND THE DRIVESHAFT. - WELL, IT'S IN. - OKAY. SO OUR LENGTH CLEARLY FITS NOW. WE HAVE THE DRIVESHAFT IN PLACE. I MEAN, IT'S GOT PLENTY OF CLEARANCE NOW. SO I'D BUY IT. LET'S GET HER DOWN AND CLEAN HER UP SO SHE CAN GO OFF TO PAINT IN THE MORNING. Kaufman: YO, NATHAN, YOU GOING TO PUT ME ON THE BALL? TODAY IS THE DAY WHERE THE LITTLE RACE CAR THAT WILL BE IS GONNA GO TO PAINT. WE'VE BLOWN IT BACK DOWN TO, LIKE, ESSENTIALLY WHEN WE FIRST STARTED, WHEN WILLIS WELDED THE CAGE IN. KC IS GONNA HANDLE THE PAINT JOB FOR US ON THIS CAR, AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO KNOCK IT OUT IN FOUR DAYS, SO GOOD NEWS FOR US, BAD NEWS FOR HIM. HE'S GOT TO PUT IN A LONG WEEKEND. OH, MY GLOVES. KC AND AARON ACTUALLY GO WAY BACK. THEY WORKED TOGETHER AT GAS MONKEY FOR YEARS. - YOU'RE SMART. - WHOO, DOGGY! Kaufman: BUT KC HAS ACTUALLY HAD HIS OWN SHOP FOR A WHILE NOW, AND SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST CAR WE'RE ACTUALLY PAINTING, IT MADE SENSE TO GO WITH SOMEBODY WE TRUST. -HELLO, SWEET CHEEKS. MY NAME IS KC MATHIEU. WE'RE AT KC'S PAINT SHOP, MY SHOP AND THE OWNER, ME AND MY WIFE, AND WE ARE A HOT ROD RESTORATION SHOP. SWEET PIECE. PIECE OF SOMETHING. SO WHEN I TALKED TO AARON, HE HAD A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME ON THIS CAR, AND WE HAD JUST -- I THINK WE HAVE FOUR DAYS TOTAL TO GET THIS THING KNOCKED OUT. - YOU GOT A FORKLIFT? - YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO PICK IT UP. I CAN PROBABLY REACH IN WITH MY FORKS FROM THE SIDE AND CATCH IT ON THE CAGE OR SOMETHING, JUST LIFT IT RIGHT UP. WHAT, Y'ALL SCARED OF YOUR CAGE? VERY. WE HAVE TO HANDLE THAT CAGE LIKE GLASS BECAUSE IT'S -- - IT'S HOMOLOGATED. - ...FIA, HOMOLOGATED. SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS, I CAN'T PICK IT UP WITH A FORKLIFT, BUT YOU CAN ROLL IT OVER AND LIFT. PRETTY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET IT OFF THERE. - LET'S DO IT. - ALL RIGHT. IS THERE ANYWHERE TO GRAB IT ON THERE? OH, DAVE, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU KNEW HOW TO MOONWALK. OH, ON BONDO DUST, IT'S REAL EASY, SUCKER. WE CAN PICK THE FRONT END UP. SLIDE UNDERNEATH IT. PULL THAT PALLET OUT AND THEN SLIDE ALL THE WAY. WE'VE GOT FOUR DAYS TO KNOCK THIS OUT. WE'RE GOING TO PAINT THE OUTSIDE JUST GLOSS WHITE. THE PAINT ON THE CAR IS ACTUALLY IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. IT'S JUST GOT SOME DINGS, SO WE'RE GONNA FIX THE COUPLE DINGS ON IT, SCUFF IT DOWN AND PUT IT IN THE BOOTH, SEAL IT AND SHOOT IT WHITE. ALL RIGHT, NOW, SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO PUT A HAND ON IT AND MAKE SURE SHE DON'T SLIDE OFF AND ROLL OVER. - OH, HEY, HEY. - YEE. Mathieu: I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A TONER OFF THE BANK AND SPRAY IT, I'M NOT GONNA MIX ANYTHING. THAT WAY, IF HE EVER WANTS ME TO FIX IT, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MATCHING, AND ON THE INSIDE, I'M GONNA DO A LOW GLOSS, SO WHENEVER HE'S DRIVING, HE DOESN'T GET ANY REFLECTIONS IN HIS HELMET. SOLID ENOUGH. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DRAG IT TO THE BODY SHOP. WE'RE WORKING ON THE WEEKEND. I ASKED A COUPLE OF MY GUYS TO COME IN. EVERYBODY SAID "NO" EXCEPT FOR TWO, SO WE'RE GONNA GET AFTER IT. WELL, THE SOONER Y'ALL GET OUT OF HERE, THE SOONER WE CAN START. - OKAY, BYE. - OKAY, BYE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER DRIVEN WITH A CO-DRIVER, SO THIS WILL BE WILD. WHY THE HECK AM I DOING THIS? YEAH, I'M MOSTLY EXCITED THAT WE HAVE AN ADULT ON THE TEAM. ALL RIGHT! FINALLY! HEY, DAVE, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO WELD THIS HERE? OH, NO. THEY'RE NOT WELDED ALL THE WAY AROUND. DUDE, THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL THAT WILL PASS. Kaufman: OUR CAGE WON'T PASS TECH. IT'S UNSAFE. THIS IS THE WORST SETBACK I THINK I'VE HAD IN MY CAREER. Man: PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY, WORLD EPICENTER FOR MOTORSPORT. THIS WEEKEND, THE ULTIMATE IN ADRENALINE AND EXCITEMENT. THOUSANDS OF FANS PACK THE STADIUMS FOR THE WORLD'S BEST DRIVERS AT THE WORLD'S MOST INCREDIBLE MOTORSPORT FACILITY. WHO WILL BE THE ULTIMATE CHAMPION, OREGON TRAIL RALLY? OH, HANG ON. I GOT TO TAKE THIS. -OKAY. WAIT A SECOND. HEY, KEN. WHAT'S UP, MAN? CAN I CALL YOU BACK? I'M DOING A THING. OKAY. I'LL CALL YOU. - I UNDERSTAND. - THANKS, BROTHER. CHEERS. Kaufman: I'M UP HERE PREPPING FOR MY RACE AT OLYMPUS. ALL OF THE RACING I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO, NOT ONE BIT OF IT HAS BEEN RALLY RACING, AND SO I'M UP HERE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HECK RALLY IS, AS WELL AS HOPEFULLY MEET MY POTENTIAL CO-DRIVER. SO DAVE HAS RECOMMENDED THAT I MEET A VETERAN CODRIVER, KRISTA SKUCAS. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY MENTAL FOR DOING THAT JOB ON THE RIGHT-HAND SEAT. - YEAH, YEAH. - YEAH. - I SECOND THAT. WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, YOU'RE LIKE, "WHY THE HECK AM I DOING THIS?" "LIKE, MY LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY RIGHT NOW. I'VE GOT A MANIAC AT THE WHEEL." IF YOU DON'T DIE, IT'S THE BEST DAY EVER. THERE ARE NOT A LARGE AMOUNT OF QUALIFIED CO-DRIVERS IN NORTH AMERICA THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE OLYMPUS TRAIL RALLY AND GETTING TO KNOW HER HERE IS REALLY A BIG STEP FORWARD IN SORTING THAT OUT. I'VE NEVER DRIVEN WITH A CO-DRIVER, SO THAT'S SOMETHING NEW THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ADAPT TO, IS DRIVING BY THE NOTES AND THEN INSTEAD OF DRIVING BY WHAT I SEE, DRIVING BY WHAT SOMEONE SAYS, BUT I'VE HEARD THAT YOU CAN WORK REALLY WELL WITH NEW DRIVERS, SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT. -YOU TELL ME. SINCE I'M SO NEW AT IT, I JUST HAVE TO TRUST THE INFORMATION THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN, AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT KRISTA KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS JOB REALLY, REALLY WELL, FURTHERMORE, THAT SHE'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD WITH NEW DRIVERS. - I'VE HAD A FEW DRIVERS. - YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S JUST ADAPTING TO PEOPLE'S PERSONALITY STYLE, LEARNING STYLE, AND HOW THEY REACT TO SOMETHING, AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT CO-DRIVERS CAN READ THAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE, TOO, AND, LIKE, CHANGE IT IN THE MOMENT. IF WE WORK TOGETHER, IT'S JUST, LIKE, I'M GONNA EXPECT THAT YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO, THAT WHAT YOU SAY TO DO IS WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING. - RIGHT. - YEAH. AND IT'S ALMOST, LIKE, CHEAT DRIVING BECAUSE IF YOU'RE USED TO DRIVING JUST WHAT YOU SEE, IMAGINE IF YOU KNEW WHAT WAS ALREADY UP AHEAD WITHOUT EVEN BEING ABLE TO SEE IT. SO... SO IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE RIGHT CO-DRIVER, AND KRISTA REALLY SEEMS LIKE A GOOD OPTION. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO CO-DRIVE WITH US. YOU CAME INCREDIBLY WELL-RECOMMENDED, SO I THINK -- - WHICH MEANS A LOT. - HERE IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, WE THINK WE'LL HAVE A CAR ON THE GROUND, AND WE'LL TALK THE FINER POINTS, BUT WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD. - STOKED. - SO -- YEAH. BECAUSE IT'S -- LIKE I SAID, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER DRIVEN WITH A CO-DRIVER, SO THIS WILL BE WILD. - YES. I'M MOSTLY EXCITED THAT WE HAVE AN ADULT ON THE TEAM. ALL RIGHT! FINALLY! ALL RIGHT. YEAH. I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT CO-DRIVER. I THINK WE'RE BUILDING THE RIGHT CAR, AND I THINK IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THE RIGHT PROGRAM. I'D HAVE TO SAY, AT THIS POINT, I'M POSSIBLY THE ONLY VARIABLE LEFT IN THE SITUATION. - KRISTA, THANKS A LOT. - YES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU IN TEXAS IN A FEW WEEKS. - WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT -- - GOOD LUCK THIS WEEKEND. ...THE DETAILS ON THAT. - YEAH. - THAT'S GOOD. - SEE YOU LATER. - BYE. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. HE'S OPEN. WE CAME UP HERE TO UNDERSTAND HOW ARA RUNS AN EVENT AND FIND OUT WHAT EVERYTHING WAS LIKE TO GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT I'LL BE FACING AT OLYMPUS. - OH, YEAH. - YEAH! COMING HERE HAS DEFINITELY FILLED THE GAP A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT OR THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE COMPLICATED. - THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT. - THAT'S A COOL CUT. GOING WITH KRISTA AS MY CO-DRIVER BRINGS A LEVEL OF CALM THAT I DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. THERE IS -- THAT PLACE WAS RESERVED FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ANXIETY. AH, DANG, THAT LOOKS FUN. I DON'T GIVE A HOW ANYBODY IS DRIVING. THEY'RE ALL OUT THERE DRIVING AROUND THE CARS, AND GOD BLESS THEM FOR IT. - YEAH. BLESS THEM, EACH AND EVERY ONE. I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST BE REALLY HAPPY TO SPECTATE. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WANT TO BE IN ONE OF THESE CARS. I THINK THIS WAS A BIG STEP IN GETTING READY, ESPECIALLY IN MY HEADSPACE. ALL I CAN SAY IS, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. WHOO! ALL RIGHT! WHY DON'T WE GO SEE KC? HE'S GOT MY RACE CAR PAINTED. ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE FUN. I'LL DO WHAT WE CAN. WHILE I WAS GONE, THE GUYS DROPPED OFF THE RACE CAR AT KC'S AND GAVE HIM FOUR DAYS TO GET IT PAINTED. - BYE, GUYS. - SEE YOU. Kaufman: MY FRIEND, DAVE, AND BOB BOILEAU, WHO OWNS PIKES PEAK INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY, WHERE WE RACED OUR SEMITRUCK, WERE BOTH IN TOWN. OH! Kaufman: THE THREE OF US BECAME PRETTY CLOSE RACING UP PIKES PEAK. HOPE THEY GOT A BATHROOM HERE. WE'LL GO FIND SOME MORE BUMPY ROADS. AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN TO TAKE THEM TO GO PICK UP MY RALLY CAR. - KC, THIS IS DAVE. - HEY, KC. - HEY, DAVE. - GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. - YEAH. - NICE TO BE HERE. - KC, THIS IS BOB. - BOB? NICE TO MEET YOU, GUYS. - HOW DID EVERYTHING GO? - WENT GOOD. THAT TOTALLY LOOKS LIKE A DANG OLD SUBARU. IT LOOKS LIKE A REFRIGERATOR. IT'S WHITE AS WHITE GETS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF REFRIGERATORS YOU GOT, MAN, BUT MINE USUALLY GOT LESS HOLES IN THEM. WE DID GET THE CAR BACK FROM KC, AND HE BUSTED HIS HUMP AND HIS GUYS, AND THEY GOT ME A CAR BACK, AND SO I'M REALLY, REALLY STOKED. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE KNOCKING IT OUT, MAN. THIS PUTS ME IN A REALLY GOOD POSITION WHERE BEFORE, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE QUESTIONABLE WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD REALLY GET THIS CAR DOWN AND DO SOME TESTING WITH MY CO-DRIVER AND STUFF. NOW, I FEEL LIKE THAT WON'T BE AN ISSUE. WELL, COOL, DUDE. AND WE'LL PICK IT UP LIKE THIS? OH, YEAH. WE CAN ROLL IT OUT THERE AND PICK IT UP AND SET IT ON THE TRAILER. THE TRUNK'S STAYING DOWN, BUT THE HOOD STILL KIND OF FREAKS ME OUT, SO IF WE CAN PUT IT ON BACKWARDS, THAT'D BE AWESOME. SO YEAH, I'M INCREDIBLY HAPPY WITH IT, AND ESPECIALLY FOR BEING PAINTED OVER A WEEKEND, I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE. HEY, LET'S GO GET YOUR TRUCK. ALL RIGHT. BAM. -YEAH. -BUT I KNOW ABOUT IT NOW. HEY, DAVE. DAVE. AREN'T THESE RALLY CARS? WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO WELD THIS HERE? WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO STITCH THIS STUFF TOGETHER? OOH. I MIGHT WANT TO FINISH THIS TUBE. OH, YEAH. THAT LOOKS NICE. THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS, THOUGH, THAT I WANT TO GO CHECK THE REST NOW. - YEAH, I WAS GOING TO SAY, YEAH. OH, NO. WE GOT SOME -- THAT'S A DENT ON THIS SQUARE PANEL. YEAH, SAME THING OVER HERE, RIGHT DOWN HERE. YEAH, SAME ON ALL OF THEM. THEY'RE NOT WELDED ALL THE WAY AROUND. DUDE, THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL THAT WILL PASS ANY KIND OF -- - LOOK AT THIS ONE DOWN HERE. - OH, MY GOD. IT'S THE SAME UP HERE. - I KNOW. - DUDE, IT'S EVERYWHERE. I KNOW. IT'S THE WHOLE CAGE. THERE'S SOME TUBES IN THERE THAT... NEED SOME LOOKING AT. EVERYTHING THAT'S HUGGED UP AGAINST THE CHASSIS ISN'T NECESSARILY, UM, YEAH. SO BOB AND I WERE LOOKING AT THE CAGE AND NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE TUBES WEREN'T FULLY WELDED ALL THE WAY AROUND. IN A CRASH, THAT WON'T HOLD UP, WHICH COULD QUITE LITERALLY BE A LIFE AND DEATH ISSUE. I'LL LET YOU TELL AARON ON OUR WAY BACK. OH, REALLY? THANKS, BUD. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - GOOD LOOKING OUT. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, BOB. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - YOU'RE THE BEST, MAN. Carapetyan: WHEN THE AMERICAN RALLY ASSOCIATION INSPECTORS DO THEIR VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE CAGE TO MAKE SURE IT'S GONNA MEET THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY SPECIFY, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE IN HELL THAT THIS CAGE WILL PASS. AT THIS POINT, THE SOONER AARON KNOWS IT, THE SOONER THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WHICH ONE? NO. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO GET INTO THIS. WE'RE RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE TIME WE NEED TO BE HEADED TO WASHINGTON. WE JUST GOT BACK FROM PRERUNNING, CHECKING OUT OREGON TRAIL, AND OUR CAGE WON'T PASS TECH. SOME JOINTS WHERE THEY WERE BUTTED UP AGAINST THE BODY OF THE CAR, THEY COULDN'T BE REACHED WITH A WELDER, SO THEY'RE UNWELDED. IT MAKES THEM PRONE TO COMING APART. SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S JUST NOT DONE. IT'S UNSAFE. WE SCREWED UP. WE SCREWED UP REALLY BAD. I SCREWED UP. WE'RE IN A PRETTY BAD SPOT, AND THAT'S GONNA SET US BACK THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND A WEEK OR MORE. THERE'S SO MUCH UP IN THE AIR. I'M SO DISAPPOINTED RIGHT NOW. IT'S, LIKE, YEAH, ME AND KRISTA NEED TO WORK, BUT RIGHT NOW, I DON'T HAVE A RACE CAR. I GOT SOMETHING, BUT IT AIN'T A RACE CAR. THIS IS THE WORST SETBACK I THINK I'VE HAD IN MY CAREER. HEY, NANDA, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND CUT THAT. AH, MAN, I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY JUST DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS. - WE FAILED. - SO LET'S FIX IT. LET'S CUT THE BODY UP. Krista: RIGHT THREE LONG. THE HARDEST PART ABOUT RALLIES IS THE RECCE. CREST TO A LEFT TWO. - AH, THAT'S A RIGHT TWO. - YIKES! DUDE, THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF UP THERE. YEAH. DO YOU KNOW WHERE AARON IS? IS HE IN HIS OFFICE OR SOMETHING? I HAVE NO IDEA. MAN, THE MOOD AROUND HERE HAS REALLY BEEN IN THE LATELY. AARON HAS BEEN IN A REAL FUNK SINCE HE PICKED UP THE CAR FROM KC. - NO. - OKAY. COLLECTIVELY, WE FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL OF OUR FAULT. IT SUCKS, BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS, AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE A LITTLE MORE FOCUSED. AH, SON OF A BITCH, MAN. I REALLY HATE, LIKE, DROPPING THE BALL, AND I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY JUST DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS. HEY, IT HAPPENED. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T DWELL ON IT. WE JUST HAVE TO MAN UP, GET THROUGH IT. YEAH. SO KIND OF A DISAPPOINTING DAY. THIS IS ALL HIGH-STRENGTH STEEL. IT'S ALL DESIGNED FOR THIS CAR TO NOT GET CRUSHED, AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO DAMAGE THAT INTEGRITY, AND WE JUST ALL KIND OF WERE ON THE SAME PAGE LIKE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO, SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHY WE DIDN'T. WE 360 WELDED ALL THE MAIN STRUCTURE OF THE CAGE THAT WE KNEW WE HAD TO 360 WELD, SO ALL THE MAIN STRUCTURE IS. IT'S THE AREAS THAT ARE HARD TO GET TO THAT AREN'T 360 WELDED. THOSE, WHERE I KIND OF MARKED, LITTLE DOTTED, I MEAN, THAT WILL GET US IN THERE. - MM-HMM. THAT WOULD GET US INTO THAT LOWER JUNCTION, THE LOWER MARKS. - MM-HMM. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO BE ABLE TO CUT THESE SECTIONS OUT AND WELD FULLY AROUND ALL THE TUBES WITHOUT DESTROYING THE CAR. WHATEVER WE DO, IT'S GONNA BE -- IT'S GOING TO BE VERY INTRUSIVE. ...A LOT OF BODY CUTTING. YEAH. WE FAILED. IT IS WHAT IT IS, SO WE'RE GONNA FIX IT. WE'RE GONNA GET IT DONE QUICKLY BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT DONE RIGHT THIS TIME, SO WE DON'T HAVE TO BACKTRACK AGAIN. DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE SOMEWHAT GAME PLAN? YEAH, I DO. Bowman: SO NOW THAT WE HAVE A PLAN OF ATTACK, WE NEED TO GET AARON ON BOARD AND HOPEFULLY EASE A LITTLE OF THE STRESS THAT'S BEEN FLOATING AROUND THE SHOP. THERE WON'T BE ANY ISSUE GETTING AROUND THOSE PLATES ALL THE WAY. - YEAH. AND THEN THERE'S A VOIDED POCKET, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A PLATE. - THAT MAKES A HUGE HERE POINT. - I THINK IT'S FINE. IT'S JUST A, TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK, BUT YOU GUYS SOUND COOL. I'M COOL WITH THAT ONE. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SITUATIONS? DOOR JAM IS KIND OF MARKED. WE'RE JUST GOING TO CUT THIS OUT, AND THEN WE'LL GET THERE. SO THE ONE THING IS, IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT, AND WE GET THIS RIGHT NOW. WE CAN CUT ANY PART OF THIS CAR APART. TAKE ANYTHING YOU NEED OFF THIS CAR TO GET THE JOB DONE. ULTIMATELY, MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A BIG ENOUGH PIECE OFF THAT WE CAN GET EVERYTHING WRAPPED UP. THIS IS SINGLE-HANDEDLY THE LARGEST EFFORT I'VE EVER PUT FORTH FOR ANYTHING, AND SO LET'S GET THIS RIGHT, AND, LIKE, IF WE MAKE 100% RECOVERY, WHAT WAS THIS, A REALLY MOMENT, YEAH, BUT ULTIMATELY -- - YOU MADE IT THROUGH. - YEAH, SO LET'S FIX IT. - LET'S CUT THE BODY UP. - ALL RIGHT. SO WE GOT THE GO-AHEAD FROM AARON TO START CUTTING THIS THING UP, AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING. SO WE'RE DETERMINED TO FIX IT FAST, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE DO IT RIGHT, SO FIRST, WE'RE GONNA REMOVE THE PIECES OF THE CAR THAT ARE BLOCKING ACCESS TO THE PARTS OF THE CAGE THAT WE COULDN'T GET TO BEFORE SO WE CAN WELD THOSE TUBES 360 DEGREES AROUND. IT'S HEARTBREAKING. WE'RE CUTTING A FRESHLY PAINTED CAR. BUT THERE'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH AT STAKE. IN RALLY RACING, DANGER IS ALWAYS LURKING JUST AROUND THE CORNER. AND ALL TOO OFTEN, RACE CARS END UP IN DITCHES, TREES OR TUMBLING END OVER END. SO A SOLID ROLL CAGE IS A MUST, AND WITH AARON AND KRISTA'S SAFETY ON THE LINE, THIS ISSUE HAS TO BE FIXED. JEREMY CUT OUT ACCESS AREAS. YOU CAN SEE THERE. I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD AND FINISH THE 1/2 INCH WORTH OF WELD. SO NOW, THIS TUBE WILL BE SECURELY WELDED 360 DEGREES AROUND. ONE DOWN, SEVEN MORE TO GO. THAT'S IT. AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, THEY SHOULD MEET THE AMERICAN RALLY ASSOCIATION STRICT STANDARDS. OH, YEAH, IT'S COMING ALONG. I THINK IT SHOULD SET US BACK ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF TOTAL. WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA TAKE CLOSER TO A WEEK OR MORE, SO THIS WAS A PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR ONCE. WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS READY TO ROCK AND ROLL, JUST WAITING ON OLD BEARDED HOLLYWOOD TO ROLL IN HERE. SO... I'M DRIVING MY PARTS CAR BECAUSE THE RACE CAR ISN'T READY DUE TO THE SETBACKS WITH THE ROLL CAGE, BUT IF I WANT TO STAND ON THE PODIUM AT OLYMPUS, WORKING WITH A CO-DRIVER IS SUPER IMPORTANT. SO I CAME DOWN HERE WITH MY PARTS CAR TO START BUILDING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH KRISTA. - HOW YOU DOING, MAN? - WHAT'S GOING ON? - HEY, AARON. - HEY, HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD. - HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT? - GOOD TO SEE YOU. - IT WAS GREAT, FABULOUS. - GOOD. - WELL, YOU GUYS WANT TO DO SOME SCRIBBLING-NOTES STUFF? - YEAH. SEE WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THAT, WHERE WE NEED TO BE. MM-HMM. Carapetyan: WHEN AARON FINALLY MAKES IT TO THE OLYMPUS RALLY, HE'S GONNA FACE OVER 200 MILES OF TWISTS AND TURNS ON A PRETTY WILDLY MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN, AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT HE CAN POSSIBLY MEMORIZE IT ALL. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT WE HAVE A CODRIVER, SO I'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROADS THAT WE USE OFF-SITE FOR SOME OF OUR CODRIVER-TRAINING STUFF THAT THEY CAN GO DO SOME RECCE ON IT. LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT. THIS THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER, SO LET'S GO SEE HOW IT GOES. - SWEET. SOUNDS GOOD. - SEE YOU THERE. - SEE YOU. PEACE. Kaufman: YOU'VE HEARD US THROWING AROUND THE TERM RECCE, WHICH IS JUST RALLY-RACING SPEAK FOR RECONNAISSANCE WHERE WE PRERUN A RALLY STAGE AND WRITE OUT OUR COURSE NOTES. I MEAN, WE COULD DO IT IN A FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE CAR, REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR, ALL-WHEEL DRIVE CAR. THE THINGS WE'RE WORKING ON AREN'T CAR CONTROLLED. WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US AND THE CAR. SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE WRITING NOTES RIGHT NOW. MY GAUGE ON CORNERS IS PRETTY SOLID. MY DISTANCES, I'M OFF ON MY DISTANCES. THERE ARE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS TO WRITING PACE NOTES WITH A CO-DRIVER. THE FIRST THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO IS ASSIGN A NUMBER TO EVERY CORNER, RANGING ANYWHERE FROM ONE THROUGH SIX. THIS IS A... RIGHT FOUR PLUS. FOUR PLUS, I THINK SO, TOO. THE LOWER THE NUMBER, THE TIGHTER THE CORNER, SO THAT A ONE IS A HAIRPIN, AND A SIX IS BARELY A CORNER AT ALL. WE GOT A DISTANCE. 50, I GUESS? OKAY, I WAS THINKING IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER, BUT 50. ON TOP OF THAT, WE NEED TO CALL OUT THE DISTANCES BETWEEN THE TURNS. AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS A DIP TO -- WHAT DO WE CALL THEM? RISE HILL... - CREST, CREST. - CREST. AND WHETHER THE ROAD IS CRESTING OR DIPPING. SO WE'RE COMING UP THE CREST HERE, AND SO IT'S -- WE'RE IN A LEFT, AND THIS IS AN INTO RIGHT. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION TELLS THE DRIVER EXACTLY HOW FAST THEY CAN ENTER AND EXIT EACH CORNER OF THE STAGE. YIKES! DUDE, THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF. YEAH. AND ALL OF THAT TO MAXIMIZE OUR SPEED WITHOUT RUNNING OFF THE ROAD OR INTO A TREE. WE'VE DONE RECCE DOWN, RECCE BACK, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED TO THE NOTES AND BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND LET'S GET BACK TOGETHER THEN. OKAY, COOL. WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EXCITING OR FUN, BUT THE HARDEST PART ABOUT RALLY, A LOT OF TIMES, IS THE RECCE PIECE. LEFT SIX OVER CREST. OPENS EXTRA LONG, 100. IT'S VERY NERDY TO JUST SIT IN A CAR AND WRITE NOTES, BUT ONCE YOU NAIL DOWN THE RECCE, THEN YOUR RACE IS GONNA GO A LOT BETTER BECAUSE YOU FEEL CONFIDENT, AND YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE ROAD. RIGHT THREE LONG. CREST INTO A LEFT TWO. UH, THAT'S A RIGHT TWO. - WAIT. - NO, NO. CREST ONE, NO. OH, LET'S START OVER. NONE OF THAT MADE SENSE. Kaufman: SO THIS IS A LITTLE TRICKIER THAN IT LOOKS. TO WORK TOGETHER LIKE A WELL-OILED MACHINE, WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. SURE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT UP FAR ENOUGH. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE CAR IS NOT BOTTOMING OUT NEARLY AS LOW AS WHAT I ANTICIPATED. I MEAN, I GOT A THREE-FINGER GAP. THAT SHOULD BE, LIKE, NO-FINGER GAP. Kaufman: WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CRUISING THIS THING THROUGH, WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO IT. YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO READ THOSE PACENOTES TO ME. THIS IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT. LEFT TWO THROUGH GATE. OPENS, CLOSES THREE, OVER A BIG CREST. I CAN DRIVE THE CAR BETTER IF I UNDERSTAND THE JOB THAT THE CO-DRIVER HAS. POND OUTSIDE, GRAVEL 30. 150 JUMP, TURN. OH, WE'RE NOT THERE YET, ARE WE? - NOPE. HERE, RIGHT FOUR. - HUH? BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN ON -- WE AREN'T ON TARMAC AT ALL. - LEFT FOUR. - YEAH. TURN. I SEE AN UP THREE. CREST. I'M LOST. DRIVE WHAT YOU SEE. - PRICE. - YES. YOU FINISH UP THE ENGINE HARNESS? YEAH, THE HARNESS, BUT THERE'S STILL HARNESS TO MAKE, SO YOU CAN LEAVE THAT OPEN. JUST THE AUXILIARY CORRECT? YEAH. BUT THE ENGINE HARNESS IS COMPLETE? YEAH. SO THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN A TOTAL BLUR, JUST TRYING TO GET AARON'S CAR READY FOR THE OLYMPUS RALLY. AFTER WE FINISHED 360 WELDING THE ROLL CAGE, WE HAD TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME, SO WE GOT TO WORK ON THE SUBARU, REINSTALLING THE FENDERS, REHANGING THE BUMPERS, AND MOUNTING OUR FULLY REBUILT RACE MOTOR. YOU LOOK GOOD ON THAT SIDE AS FAR AS CYLINDER CLEARANCE? - MAYBE. - IT LOOKS OKAY. OKAY, COME ON. BUT WITH ONLY A FEW DAYS TO GO UNTIL THIS CAR HAS TO BE ON ITS WAY TO WASHINGTON, WE STILL HAVE A PRETTY LONG LIST TO GET THROUGH. FOR STARTERS, JASON IS INSTALLING OUR NEW FUEL TANK, COMPLETE WITH A PROTECTIVE SKID PLATE. Bowman: WE GOT THE FUEL TANK UP IN THERE, STRAPS UP. OUR KEVLAR-MOTORSPORT FUEL-TANK SKID PLATE, SUPER STRONG. YOU COULD SHOOT IT, BULLETPROOF, YOU KNOW, STUFF, THE THINGS? IT'S HARD. THERE ACTUALLY WAS NOT A SKID PLATE ON THIS FROM THE FACTORY. THERE WAS JUST SOME LITTLE PLASTIC SURROUNDS THAT GO ON IT, SO YOU CAN'T REALLY CALL IT A SKID PLATE. YOU KNOW, IT WAS MORE OF A ROCK COLLECTOR. OBVIOUSLY, WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE CRUISING THIS THING THROUGH, WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO IT? WE'RE ALSO INSTALLING A SKID PLATE UP FRONT TO PROTECT OUR HEADER AND OIL PAN. WE GOT J ROD WORKING ON ALL THE AUXILIARY WIRING. WE'RE ACTUALLY USING ECU MASTERS DISTRIBUTION CENTRAL FOR ALL OUR EXTERNAL OR PRIMARY FUNCTIONS LIKE OUR BIG LIGHTS UPFRONT, OUR BETTER FUEL PUMPS, THINGS LIKE THAT. Bowman: AND JEREMY IS WORKING ON A CUSTOM INTAKE TO ALLOW FOR BETTER AIRFLOW OVER THE STOCK SYSTEM. I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF CUTS... SOME ADJUSTMENTS. GO AHEAD AND WELD THIS TUBE TOGETHER, AND WE'LL TRIM THIS DOWN TO SIZE TO WHERE WE LIKE IT. Bowman: THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE LEFT ON OUR LIST, BESIDES MAKING SURE THE MOTOR RUNS, IS TO GET THE SUSPENSION INSTALLED AND DIALED IN. AARON IS GONNA BE PUSHING THIS THING HARD, DOWN SOME PRETTY BRUTAL TERRAIN, SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS THING HANDLES EVEN BETTER THAN THE CAR HE'S BEEN PRACTICING WITH AND THAT IT CAN TAKE THE ABUSE. IT LOOKS WAY LONG, YOU KNOW, LIKE, WAY TOO LONG. SO WE RAN INTO A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH THE STRUTS WE'RE GOING WITH. BASICALLY, THEY'RE MUCH LONGER THAN THE STOCK STRUTS AND SEEM LIKE IT'LL NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RIDE HEIGHT. I THREW ON A STOCK WHEEL AND COMPRESSED THE SUSPENSION TO GET AN IDEA OF THE TRAVEL ON OUR NEW SETUP. THEY'RE LIFTING THE CAR UP PRETTY GOOD NOW. SO WE'RE AN INCH OF SHAFT SHOWING ON FULL COMPRESSION, IT LOOKS LIKE, ON THE STRUT. - THAT'S FULL COMPRESSION? AND FULLY COMPRESSED, WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF SPACE IN OUR WHEEL WELL. SURE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT UP FAR ENOUGH, - BUT I GUESS SO, ANOTHER -- - 14 AND 5/8ths. ...3/4 OF AN INCH. - SITTING ON OUR HUB. YOU WANT TO MOUNT A TIRE ON OUR NEW METHOD RACE WHEEL SO WE CAN CHECK THOSE? SO RIGHT NOW, MY CONCERN IS THAT THE CAR IS GOING TO SIT A LOT TALLER THAN WE ANTICIPATE IT TO SIT AND WHEN THE CAR FULLY BOTTOMS OUT, IT'S NOT BOTTOMING OUT NEARLY AS LOW AS WHAT I ANTICIPATED. WHEN THE STRUTS COMPLETELY BOTTOMED OUT, WE STILL HAVE A PRETTY HIGH RIDE HEIGHT, WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS JUST, LIKE, WASTING POTENTIAL WHEEL TRAVEL. YOU READY TO TRY? WE'RE AT FULL BUMP. THIS IS THE WHEEL AND TIRE WE'RE GONNA USE. I HAVE FULL CLEARANCE AS TO THE TIRE NOT HITTING ANYTHING IN THE CAR. OH, LOOK RIGHT HERE. YOU KNOW, THAT'S -- I MEAN, I GOT A THREE-FINGER GAP. THAT SHOULD BE, LIKE, NO-FINGER GAP. SINCE WE CAN'T REALLY MODIFY THE STRUT TOWERS OR THE LOWER MOUNTS DUE TO THE RESTRICTIONS OF OUR CLASS, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SOURCE SHORTER STRUTS. WITH THE CAR NEEDING TO LEAVE TO WASHINGTON IN TWO DAYS, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE WE'LL BE INSTALLING THEM IN THE DIRT AT RALLY HEADQUARTERS, THAT IS, IF THEY SHOW UP AT ALL. - NEXT WEEK... - IT'S DONE. IT'S HERE. Kaufman: WE FINALLY MAKE IT TO WASHINGTON FOR THE OLYMPUS RALLY. -GO. Kaufman: AND WITH MY SIGHTS SET ON THE PODIUM... Krista: LEFT THREE LONG. Kaufman: ...I PUSH MY SKILL... - FOUR. - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHOA, WHOA. ...AND MY RACE CAR TO THE VERY EDGE. - AH, WE GOT -- - HEY, HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY! OH, GOD.
