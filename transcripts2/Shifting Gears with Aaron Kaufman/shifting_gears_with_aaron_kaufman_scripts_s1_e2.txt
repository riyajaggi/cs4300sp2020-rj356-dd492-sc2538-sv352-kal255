 Kaufman: I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVE MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HAND-PICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. JONATHAN MANSOUR AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE BEFORE WE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE.

 COME ON. STAY. A SELF-TAUGHT ELECTRONICS MASTER WITH MORE THAN 15 YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY, JON RODRIQUEZ CAN HACK ANYTHING WITH A CIRCUIT BOARD. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL. AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST. I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS TONIGHT I HIT THE ROAD TO VEGAS... ALL RIGHT! ...FOR THE SEMA CONVENTION. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DAMN GOOD TIME. YEAH! HOW Y'ALL DOING? AND LATER, THE SCOUT SLAMS INTO US... MAKING ALL KINDS OF PRESSURE. ...IN EVERY WAY THAT IT CAN. - WE GOT A LEAK DOWN HERE. - THERE'S A HELL OF A LEAK THERE. YEE-HOO-HOO-HOO! - WHOA. - WE GOT NO POWER AT ALL. WE ARE DEAD IN THE WATER. AW, COME ON. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S THE PLAN? THIS TRUCK'S GOING TO VEGAS. SWEET. BETTER GET IN IT IF YOU WANT TO GO. ALL RIGHT. Kaufman: SO, WE'RE UP BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING HEADED OUT TO THE SEMA CONVENTION IN LOST VEGAS, A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO RECONNECT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IN THE BUSINESS. JOINING ME ON THIS ADVENTURE IS BROOKS, OUR SOCIAL-MEDIA GURU WHO WILL DOCUMENT THE EVENT. MY GIRLFRIEND LAUREN WILL BE COMING ALONG AS WELL. IT'S OVER 1,200 MILES FROM DALLAS TO VEGAS, SO WE'LL BE ON THE ROAD FOR TWO DAYS. LET'S JUST CALL IT A BIT OF A ROAD TRIP. YOU KNOW, SIX WEEKS AGO I OPENED MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT, AND MY TEAM AND I SET OUT TO TURN AN INTERNATIONAL SCOUT INTO A STREET-LEGAL RACECAR CAN THAT COULD COMPETE AT THE KING OF THE HAMMERS, CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE TOUGHEST OFF-ROAD COURSE IN THE WORLD. WELL, THERE SHE IS, IN ALL OF HER DENTED GLORY. MY BUILDERS HAD NEVER WORKED WITH A VEHICLE THAT WAS IN SUCH BAD SHAPE. WHAT FILL DID YOU PICK THIS UP IN? IT'S ALL STILL THERE, IT'S JUST FULL OF DIRT. BUT ONCE THEY WRAPPED THEIR HEAD AROUND IT, THEY FINALLY DUG IN. YEAH! WE HAD A FEW CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY -- CREATING NEW FENDERS... RIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD, - BUT IT'S JUST TOO MANY PIECES. - TOO MANY CUTS. ...BUILDING OUR VERY OWN CHASSIS. ALL RIGHT, SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE A LOT MORE SET UP TO DO. YOU CAN SEE HOW I CRUSHED THE BACKSIDE OF THIS. IT'S BEEN A JOURNEY FOR ALL OF US, ESPECIALLY ME. NEVER BEEN TO A HAMMERS EVENT, NEVER BEEN TO AN ULTRA4 EVENT. BUT AFTER DRIVING THESE ULTRA4s... A LITTLE BIT, DRIVER. I REALIZE NOW HOW CRAZY MY IDEA OF TAKING THE SCOUT TO KING OF THE HAMMERS IS. UH-OH. MAN. WHAT HAVE I DONE? BUT THERE'S NO TIME FOR SECOND GUESSING. WE'RE AT THE HALFWAY MARK ON BUILDING THE SCOUT... WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. ...AND I LEFT A LAUNDRY LIST FOR MY GUYS TO ACCOMPLISH WHILE I'M AWAY. THAT'S A TON OF STUFF. - YEAH. OH, YEAH. - BASICALLY BUILD THE TRUCK. THERE CAN BE NO ROOM FOR MISTAKES IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT TO THE KING OF THE HAMMERS ON TIME. GO TEAM! I LOVE DRIVING. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I LOVE BEING OUT WEST. THINGS HAVE BEEN, YOU KNOW, REALLY CHAOTIC AND REALLY STRESSFUL AT THE SHOP BUILDING OUR SCOUT FOR KING OF THE HAMMERS, SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT IF TIME TO DECOMPRESS. IT'S VERY MIND-CLEARING, CATHARTIC ACTIVITY. AND SO BEING ABLE TO INTERMITTENTLY HOP OFF 40 AND SEE SOME OF ROUTE 66 IN VARIOUS PLACES, IT'S ENTERTAINING, IT'S FUN, AND IT'S PLEASURABLE TO THINK ABOUT. SOME PARTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ERASED, AND OTHER PARTS THAT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THEY USED TO THE WHOLE TIME. THE CARS GET OLDER, THE PLACE GETS DIRTIER. IT DOESN'T CHANGE. I DIDN'T SEE ANY DINOSAURS. Y'ALL SEE ANY DINOSAURS? Lauren: OOH, THAT'S A COOL BUILDING. TRAILS WEST LOUNGE. IT'S THE T.W. LOUNGE! OH, HELL, YES! T-DUB. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE TO SEE -- ALL THE OLD SIGNS, ALL THE NEON, OBVIOUSLY ALL THE OLD CARS -- JUST A GLIMPSE OF HOW THINGS USED TO BE. 1955 THEY APPROVED FUNDING FOR BUILDING THIS MASSIVE FREEWAY SYSTEM FROM ATLANTIC TO PACIFIC AND FROM THE CANADIAN BORDER TO THE MEXICAN BORDER. IT CHANGED HOW CAR WERE BUILT, BECAUSE THEY WERE CROSSING A CONTINENT, AND THEY WERE DOING IT FASTER THAN THEY EVER HAD BEFORE, SO THE VEHICLES HAD TO STEER BETTER AT HIGH SPEEDS, THEY HAD TO BE MORE STABLE, THEY HAD TO BRAKE BETTER, AND BE SAFER, QUITE FRANKLY. YOU THINK MAYBE WE GOT FREEWAYS 'CAUSE THEY MADE FASTER CARS -- WE GOT FASTER CARS 'CAUSE THEY MADE FREEWAYS. OH, I LIKE-A THAT ONE, MUCHO, MUCHO. SO, AARON'S GONE ON THIS ROAD TRIP TO SEMA. HE LEFT US WITH A LONG LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS TO DO ON THE SCOUT HE PLANS TO RACE AT KING OF THE HAMMERS. OUR NEXT STEP IS TO PERMANENTLY MARRY THE CUSTOM CHASSIS WE BUILT TO THE BODY. Bowman: HEY, DON'T CARRY SO MUCH, JOSH. Rodriquez: YOU GOT TO LET ME GET SOME WEIGHT, TOO, THERE, JOSH. Freeman: OPEN UP THE JACK STAND, SET UP IN THE FRONT OR THE BACK. HOW YOU DOING THERE, JON? Bowman: THIS IS A HUGE STEP FOR US. ONCE THIS GETS MARRIED TOGETHER, EVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING. WE'RE GONNA STUFF AN INDUSTRIAL INJECTION CUMMINS MOTOR, THE TRANS... YOU NEED TO COME BACK TOWARDS JOSH. ...AND THE ADVANCED ADAPTERS TRANSFER CASE IN. BOLT THAT ALL UP, SEE WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE LIES. THAT'S FUN. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THE -- FIRST TIME ALL THE WEIGHT'S BEEN ON THE FRAME. COOL. I LIKE IT. WE'RE DOING GOOD. WE'RE TRYING TO LOWER THE BODY DOWN ON THE CHASSIS RIGHT NOW. KEEP COMING. YEAH. HOLY CRAP. THE TURBO'S NOT GONNA FIT BETWEEN THE FRAME RAILS. OH,. IT'S A BIG ONE. START CUTTING, HOMEY. THE TURBO -- OUR TURBO SET-UP IS GONNA HIT RIGHT HERE, SO WE HAD TO TAKE THE TURBOS OFF -- LIKELY, JOSH OR JEREMY'S GONNA HAVE TO GET IN HERE AND JUST CUT HUGE CHUNKS OFF OF THIS THING TO GET THESE THINGS TO WORK 'CAUSE THE PACKAGE IS SO BIG. IT LOOKS TO BE PRETTY WELL CLEAR. Rodriquez: SO, YOU WANT ME TO GO DOWN WITH IT? - YEAH. - WE GOT A FAR WAYS TO GO. AS FAR AS SPACE-WISE GOES IN HERE, ONCE ALL THIS IS TOGETHER, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TWO-AND-A-HALF INCH CHARGE PIPE RUNNING OUT OF THE TOP TURBO INTO THE INNER COOLER. WE'LL HAVE RADIATOR HOSES RUNNING THIS WAY. WE'LL HAVE A/C LINES RUNNING EVERY WHICH WAY, WE'LL HAVE ROLL-CAGE STUFF COMING IN. I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE MASSIVE, ALL THE CRAP GOING ON IN HERE. IT'LL LOOK LIKE A DISASTER, BUT IT'LL BE A CALCULATED DISASTER. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOT TO BE ON THE TUNNEL. IN THE END, IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO A FRACTION OF AN INCH... OKAY, READY? YEP. ...BUT WHEN IT ALL COMES TOGETHER, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. - YEAH. THERE IT IS. - THAT'S PRETTY COOL. LOOK AT THOSE SLIDERS, DUDE. - YEAH. - THAT'S BAD. - OH, COOL. - I LIKE THEM. OKAY. NEXT STEP. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. WHEN WE START DRIVING THROUGH ARIZONA, THAT'S WHEN IT GETS REALLY, REALLY PRETTY. Brooks: YEAH, THE PETRIFIED FOREST IS COOL. I HAVE A PIECE OF PETRIFIED WOOD. YOU STOLE FROM AN NATIONAL PARK? NO, I BOUGHT IT FROM SOME, LIKE, PLACE. Kaufman: WE'VE GOT A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER ALL THE WAY FROM DALLAS TO LAS VEGAS WHERE THE SEMA SHOW IS. ALONG THE WAY, WE'RE GOING TO VISIT AS MANY LITTLE ROUTE 66 STOPS AS WE CAN. Lauren: THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF MEAT. IT'S JUST GLUTTONY NONSTOP. YEAH. WHAT'S YOU'RE DOING IS SO CREEPY. - CREEPY. - YEAH. WELL, WE STILL GOT A-WAYS TO GO. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, WHAT BEAUTIFUL ROADS WE HAVE. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIMPLICITY TO JUST DRIVE, YOU KNOW? THE ABILITY TO JUST FEEL THE VIBRATION, TO JUST GET OUT, BREATHE A LITTLE BIT -- IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES ME THE HAPPIEST. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. Kaufman: HE IS BOOKING IT FOR A CHOO-CHOO. HE'S PULLING A LOT -- A LARGE LOAD. Kaufman: THE WEST HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO ESCAPE. I TRY AND IMAGINE WHO LIVES THERE AND WHAT THEY DO AND WHY IS IT ABANDONED NOW? HOW COME THESE BUILDINGS ARE EMPTY? WHAT IF I SOLD EVERYTHING AND GAVE UP ALL THIS CRAP AND JUST, LIKE, LIVED THERE? LIKE, HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE? - HEY. - YEP? LET ME GET SOME VIDEO OF THIS WAVING MAJESTICALLY IN THE BREEZE. YEAH. GOOD ENOUGH. SEE, LOOK AT HOW PROUDLY IT WAVES. BEST OF LUCK. DUDE, THIS IS, LIKE, IF I WON THE PGA TOUR. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY -- WOMEN LOVE A SHARP-DRESSED MAN. WELL, LET'S FLEE. Kaufman: I LIKE DRAMATIC LANDSCAPES. I LIKE BIG SKIES. I LIKE BIG ROCKS. I LIKE A LOT OF ROAD LAID OUT IN FRONT OF ME. THIS PLACE IS SO MASSIVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? - ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL? IT'S DEFINITELY A BEAUTIFUL, BIG HOLE. LET'S GO. LET'S GO TO VEGAS. SEMA IS THE INDUSTRY INSIDE SHOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DAMN GOOD TIME. HOW Y'ALL DOING? WE HAVE A BRAND-NEW BUSINESS, AND SO WE PUT AN EVENT TOGETHER. LET'S GET THESE TRUCKS FIRED UP. IT WILL PROBABLY BE VERY BUMPY. ALL RIGHT, BOYS AND GIRLS, WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A LAP. WE GOT NO POWER AT ALL. IN FACT, WE'RE UNRESPONSIVE. - MOTORS. - YEAH, THAT'S SAD. - MOTOR'S DEAD. OH, COME ON! YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! Kaufman: WE'LL SEE YOU. TAKE CARE. HOW YOU DOING? - I'M FROM AUSTRALIA. - OH, VERY COOL! - YEAH, MATE. I WAS DOWN THERE IN 2008, AND HAVEN'T' HAD A CHANCE TO GET BACK. YEAH, MATE, YOU NEED TO. YOU NEED TO GET DOWN THERE. IT'S BUSY. SEMA'S BUSY. THANKS SO MUCH. HOW YOU DOING? NUMBER-ONE FAN FROM SCOTLAND. ALL RIGHT! I'VE NEVER HAD SO MANY PEOPLE COME UP AND SAY "GOOD ON YA." EVERYBODY'S SO EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE GOT GOING ON. THE TERM "FEELING THE LOVE" -- PROBABLY NEVER MORE ACCURATE... ...THAN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. HERE -- HERE 2017 IN SEMA -- BEEN COMING HERE 14 YEARS, AND TALK ABOUT A DRIVING FORCE. IT'LL BE A MOTIVATING FORCE. YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER PLACE TO FIND INSPIRATION. SEMA IS AN ACRONYM FOR SPECIALTY EQUIPMENT MARKETING ASSOCIATION. THIS IS THE INDUSTRY INSIDE SHOW. IT'S WHERE EVERYONE WHO'S MAKING A PART OR A WIDGET, WHETHER IT'S A NEON LIGHT, A WHEEL, A TIRE, A BIG BRAKE PACKAGE -- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IS IT. THERE'S VENDORS SHOWCASING THEIR PRODUCTS, AND THE BEST WAY TO DO IT INSTEAD OF LAYING THEM ON A TABLE IS PUT THEM ON A CAR. - AARON! - HEY, HOW ARE YOU? THANKS FOR COMING BY THE CAR. SO, WE SEE ALL THE GREAT WORK, WE SEE ALL THE OTHER BUILDERS... IT BROKE 200 MILES PER HOUR, AND WE'RE PUTTING OUT ABOUT 1,700, 1,800 HORSEPOWER. ...AND THAT MAKES US WANT TO BUILD BETTER, BUILD FASTER, BUILD HARDER. YOU MAE ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE POWER I MAKE, BUT LET'S -- LET'S GET TOGETHER AND GO PLAY CARS ON THE TRACK ONE DAY. - LET'S DO IT, MAN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THOUGH, THE FANS, EVERYBODY BEHIND US, THEY'RE ROOTING FOR US, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE CAN'T LET DOWN. WE'LL SEE YA. THANKS, GUYS. NO, YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HASN'T BEEN HERE. YOU TELL ME. THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. SO, IF YOU DON'T DRIVE THESE THINGS, THEY'RE LITTLE MORE THAN SCULPTURE. WHENEVER WE HAVE THE "FORD OUT FRONT" EVENT, PEOPLE GET TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS, WHAT MOTORSPORT IS, WHAT FUN IS. THEY GET TO WATCH IT, AND THEN THEY'RE PUTTING PEOPLE IN THESE CARS, AND THEY'RE SLIDING THEM AROUND. AND THIS A LEVEL OF DRIVING THAT NONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO HOME AND DO AND PROBABLY NEVER BE CAPABLE OF DOING, AND SO IT REALLY SHOWS PEOPLE THE DEPTH OF WHAT THIS INDUSTRY CAN BE. THIS IS VAUGHN GITTIN'S TRUCK, THE FUN HAVER, AND SO WE'RE GONNA TRY AND SEE IF IT'LL LIVE UP TO ITS NAME, GO HAVE SOME FUN. THE SCULPTURE'S ALL RIGHT, BUT SLIDING SIDEWAYS AND BOILING TIRES, THAT'S WHAT WE GET OFF ON. SHUT THAT DOOR! - GOT IT. - ALL RIGHT, YOU READY TO ROCK? - YEAH, LET'S DO IT. YEAH! HOW Y'ALL DOING? TODAY WE GOT TO RIDE WITH VAUGHN GITTIN IN THE FUN HAVER, AND WHAT A BLAST THAT WAS. I'LL TELL YOU, VAUGHN KNOWS HOW TO SLING IT AROUND, AND THE NAME SAYS IT ALL. IT'S THE ULTIMATE FUN HAVER. SO, BROCKY, SEE YOU IN FEBRUARY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE BUILDING A SCOUT RIGHT NOW, THE 4BT, 6L80, CURRIES FRONT AND BACK, AND SO WE'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE, MAN. SICK, WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT, BRO. GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING, MAN. - YES, SIR. - HAPPY FOR YOU. - THANKS FOR THE RIDE. - NO WORRIES. NO, I'M READY TO START BUILDING THIS TANK. SO I'VE GOT MY 8th-INCH ALUMINUM. WE'RE GONNA GET IT ALL CUT UP, AND WE'RE GONNA WELD IT TOGETHER, AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE A GAS TANK. BUT NOT JUST ANY GAS TANK, BUT SOMETHING ESPECIALLY BUILT TO TAKE ON KING OF THE HAMMERS. IN THIS UPCOMING RACE, AARON'S GONNA FACE LONG, FUEL-GUZZLING, HIGH-SPEED STRETCHES, SO I'M GONNA MAKE THIS FUEL TANK LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD MORE FUEL. BUT EVEN MORE OF A CHALLENGE IS THE INTENSE ROCK CLIMBING THAT PUTS THESE VEHICLES IN IMPOSSIBLE ANGLES. SO I'M BUILDING THIS TANK WITH ITS OWN ANGLES. IT ACTUALLY WILL HELP US GOING THROUGH THE TRAILS AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT, SO WE'RE ROCK CRAWLING AND DOING STUFF AND GOING IN EXTREME ANGLES. THE FUEL IS ACTUALLY RUNNING IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. IT'S TRYING TO STAY IN THIS POCKET. YOU KNOW, IT'S CHALLENGING, AND THAT'S PART OF BUILDING SOMETHING FULLY CUSTOM, AND IT'S WORTH ALL THAT WORK IN THE END BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY PROUD OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. "FUEL: STORAGE... BLADDER CONSTRUCTION... OF NYLON OR DACRON WOVEN AND FABRIC IMPREGNATED AND COATED WITH A FUEL-RESISTANT ELASTOMER." SO, I'M LOOKING HERE IN THE RULES, AND IT SAYS THAT THE FUEL TANK THAT JEREMY'S GOT IS NOT GONNA WORK, AND THEY WANT US TO HAVE A BLADDER INSIDE IT, SO, IT'S... THAT SUCKS. WELL, JEREMY'S GONNA BE BUMMED. SO, BASICALLY YOUR FUEL CELL'S NOT GONNA WORK. - SWEET. - YEAH. IT HAS TO HAVE A BLADDER IN IT. SO -- THAT MEANS I DON'T' GET TO USE MY FUEL CELL, BECAUSE WE CAN'T -- WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO HAVE SOMEBODY MAKE A BLADDER SYSTEM FOR THE FUEL CELL THAT I BUILT. WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA LOSE GALLONS ON THE TANK ITSELF, BUT IT'S UNFORTUNATE IT, BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOT EVEN SO MUCH THE MATERIAL, IT'S THE TIME THAT IT TOOK TO MAKE THAT THING. OH, YEAH. I KNOW. MM-HMM. CAN WE HAVE THOSE DAYS BACK? - PROBABLY NOT. - CAN YOU REFUND THOSE? IT'S EASY -- YOU PUT IT ON CRAIGSLIST. "INTERNATIONAL SCOUT," YOU KNOW, "FUEL CELL." - YEAH. - SURE IT'LL SELL LIKE HOT CAKES. Kaufman: WE HAVE A BRAND-NEW BUSINESS. AND THE BUSINESS IS SO NEW, WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT SHOWCASING ANY OF OUR BUILDS, ANY OF OUR PARTS HERE AT SEMA 2017. AND SO WE PUT AN EVENT TOGETHER, TORQUE & TACOS, FOR THE GUYS WE DO BUSINESS WITH, AND SO WE'RE GONNA HEAD OUT TO VEGAS ALL FOR EXPERIENCE. WE'VE RENTED THE TRACK, WE'VE RENTED A COUPLE CARS, GOT TWO REAL DRIVERS, AND THEN MYSELF. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DAMN GOOD TIME. SO, HERE'S THE DEAL. I'M GONNA BE GIVING SOME RIDE-ALONGS. DON'T JUDGE ME TOO HARSHLY. WE GOT SOME OTHER PROFESSIONALS GIVING SOME RIDE-ALONGS OUT HERE. I SUGGEST TAKING A RIDE WITH ME AND THEN THE FAST GUYS. THAT WAY MY RIDE'S NOT BORING. BUT I WANTED TO HAVE FUN, AND I WANTED Y'ALL TO COME OUT AND HAVE FUN WITH ME. I'M SO STOKED THAT EVERYONE'S OUT HERE. ENJOY THE TACOS. ENJOY THE BEER. ENJOY THE DRINKS. IT'S GONNA BE GREAT. LET'S GET THESE TRUCKS FIRED UP. SOUND GOOD? - ONE QUICK NOTE, REAL QUICK -- - OH, IF THIS IS ABOUT SAFETY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT SAFETY. THANKS FOR FLYING VORE AIR THIS EVENING. WELL, YOUR RIDE WILL NOT BE SMOOTH. IT WILL PROBABLY BE VERY BUMPY. THE COCKTAIL SERVICE WILL SUCK. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU BETTER AIM OUT THAT WINDOW. SO, IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA -- I WANTED TO GO PLAY WITH THE TRUCKS, I WANTED ALL MY FRIENDS AND MY NOT-YET FRIENDS TO COME HAVE A GOOD TIME, AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. WE HAD THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE SHOW UP. EVERYBODY GOT RIDES. THERE WERE GUYS ON THE TRACK THAT ARE WAY FASTER THAN ME, BUT I DON'T THAT ANYONE WAS HAVING MORE FUN THAN ME. I'D DO IT EVERY WEEK IF WE COULD. THAT'S THAT. NOW WE PARTY. I'M SO HAPPY Y'ALL MADE IT OUT. - WE HAD A BLAST. - YEAH? SO, AM I -- SO, I'M 35. THIS IS THE FIRST PARTY I'VE EVER THROWN. I HOPE IT WENT WELL. 2017 SEMA -- I KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR, I KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE A BOOTH, I KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE A PRODUCT HERE, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE DID HAVE, IS WE HAD A LOT OF LOVE, WE MET A LOT OF GUYS, HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS. MAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT, GUYS. - THANK YOU, MAN. - THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT YEAR. IT'S GONNA BE A BIG ROLLER COASTER. YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME? - YEAH! - GOOD. LET'S SEE HOW THAT LINE LOOKS OVER AT THE BAR. Freeman: AARON'S ON HIS WAY BACK FROM SEMA. FIRST DAY BACK, THERE'S ALWAYS WISHING WE GOT MORE DONE, BUT WE'RE HERE WHERE WE'RE HERE, AND WE'RE AT WHERE WE'RE AT. LET'S SEE HOW THE FENDERS LOOK. - HOLY CRAP. - IT'S BROKE. THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT, SO THIS IS WHAT WE GOT TO DEAL WITH. Rodriquez: WHAT DO YOU SEE, JOSH? Freeman: I'M JUST LOOKING AT WHAT I DID. SEEING THE EXTRA I HAVE TO TRIM. YEAH. I THINK WE SHOULD WAIT ON THE EXHAUST, THOUGH, 'CAUSE THEY MIGHT GET CLOSE. WE HAVE THOSE LINK ARMS TO DEAL WITH, TOO, THE UPPER LINKS. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. Freeman: AARON'S ON HIS WAY BACK FROM SEMA, FIRST DAY BACK. I THINK HE'LL BE STOKED ON WHAT WE GOT DONE. BUT WITH ONLY A WEEK AND A HALF LEFT, THERE'S ALWAYS WISHING WE GOT MORE DONE, BUT WE'RE HERE WHERE WE'RE HERE, AND WE'RE AT WHERE WE'RE AT. - HOW Y'ALL DOING, GUYS? - MORNING. HOW YOU DOING? DID YOU HAVE A BLAST? YEAH. WE'RE PLANNING ON DOING IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND MAYBE INVOLVING -- - US? - WELL, YES -- FIRST OF ALL, WE PLAN ON HAVING VEHICLES THERE, AND SO WE PLAN ON BEING A PRESENCE THERE AS A COMPANY INSTEAD OF JUST PAYING BILLS. BUT ANYWAY, WE DEFINITELY HAD A GOOD TIME, BUT BACK TO REALITY. WELL, HERE WE ARE. - YEAH, DEFINITELY. WE HAVE A MAIN HOOP IN, AND... - YEAH, I SAW. - EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. I THINK THE LANDINGS ARE EXCELLENT ON THAT. AND I SAW YOU TOOK THE A/C BUCKETS IN... IT FIT IN, YEAH. Y'ALL ARE MAKING THE MOUNTS FOR IT? - ALREADY DONE. - IT'S ALREADY DONE. - ALL RIGHT, SO A/C'S IN. - A/C'S IN. KEEP WORKING ON THE CAGE SECTION. IT LOOKS SUPER GREAT. IN FACT, IT LOOKS SO TIGHT, HAVE Y'ALL BEEN ABLE TO POP THE ROOF BACK ON? - YEAH. - OH, YEAH. - IT JUST -- - YEAH, AND I'M COOL WITH THAT. I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU HAVE TO USE, AS LONG AS IT WILL GO BACK IN THERE. THE GUYS HAVE GOT THE A/C IN. THE CAGE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CHASSIS. THAT'S GOING TOGETHER WELL. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO TACKLE THE ENTIRE WISH LIST I GAVE THEM, BUT CONSIDERING WE HAVE A BRAND-NEW SHOP THAT'S NOT FINISHED, A BRAND-NEW TEAM THAT'S NEVER WORKED TOGETHER, I THINK IT'S PROGRESSING AT A REASONABLY CLOSE-TO-WHAT-I-EXPECTED RATE. WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE. IT LOOKS GREAT. I LOVE HOW TIGHT IT IS. I LOVE HOW IT'S IN THE CAB AND IT POKES OUT OF THE CAB, AND, YEAH, I'M DOWN. IT SHOULD COME TOGETHER REALLY NICE. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. - I LIKE IT, SO -- - OW!... IT'S JUST ANOTHER AFFIRMATION THAT WHEN HE DOES GO SOMEWHERE HE CAN TRUST US WITH THE WORK, AND WE ALL HAVE THE SAME VISION TO GET EVERYTHING DONE HOW HE SEES IT AND HOW WE SEE IT. - RIGHT ON. - ANYWAY, GUYS -- GUYS, IT LOOKS -- IT LOOKS GREAT, SO JUST LET'S KEEP ON KEEPING ON. NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THAT BEHIND US, NOTHING BUT JUST "GET FINISHED" AHEAD OF US. THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO IS GONNA SUCK A LOT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT THAT STILL HAS TO BE DONE. WE JUST HAVE TO PUSH THAT MUCH HARDER. THE LIST IS VERY LONG RIGHT NOW. LET'S ROCK AND ROLL, GUYS. THANKS SO MUCH. OKAY. HERE WE GO. WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE LUNCH, MAN. YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT? CHILI CHEESEBURGER. - OH, MAN! I WANT TATER TOTS ON THE BURGER, THEN THE CHILI ON TOP OF THE TATER TOTS. - OH! Bowman: I THINK WE'RE ALL PRETTY STOKED AT HOW THE DEAL WENT DOWN THIS MORNING WITH AARON CHECKING EVERYTHING OUT. IT'S A REALLY GOOD FEELING TO KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE, THAT WE CAN GET THE JOB DONE HOW HE THINKS AND HOW WE THINK IT SHOULD GET DONE. HEY, GUYS, WELCOME TO BIG STATE. - HEY. - HELLO. - HOW'S IT GOING? - IT'S GOING. SO ON THAT NOTE, WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD TIME TO GO OUT AND GRAB SOME LUNCH. Y'ALL -- Y'ALL DIGGING IT SO FAR? MY GOAL IS TO FINISH THIS THING IN TIME FOR KING OF THE HAMMERS. SO, I DON'T THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S JUST -- - IT'S THE TUBE WORK -- IT'S GONNA BE A BUNCH OF TUBE WORK AND TABBING. YEAH. I WISH THAT ANY OF US UNDERSTOOD MORE ABOUT THE DRAWING ASPECT OF IT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LEADER IN OUR LITTLE GROUP HERE, AND HE'S GOT HIS WHOLE VISION... - YEAH, WELL, IT'S HIS TRUCK. IT'S HIS GIG, WHICH IS COOL. Rodriquez: YOU KNOW, LIKE, FOR US WE'RE ALL A NEW CREW, SO, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T NECESSARILY SEE HIS VISION. YEAH. WORKING WITH OTHER DUDES NOW IS -- IS A HUGE CHANGE OF PACE FOR ME. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL OWNED OUR OWN SHOP, SO THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE FOR US. IT'S HARD TO RELINQUISH SOME OF THE COMMAND, BUT I THINK WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD AT IT, I THINK. IT'LL TAKE A COUPLE BUILDS, BUT WE'LL START SEEING THINGS BEFORE HE EVEN SAYS IT. I THINK SO, TOO, FOR SURE. - JOSH? - YEAH? I NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR MIC. CAN YOU JUST... THANKS. TOTAL PROPS. OKAY, I WAS GONNA SAY THE BURGER MADE MY DAY -- NOPE. KERRI DEFINITELY DID. SO KING OF THE HAMMERS IS GONNA BE ON US BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, SO I'M TRYING TO GET ADVICE FROM ANYWHERE I CAN FIND IT. IN THIS CASE, IT TURNS OUT OUR STEERING VENDOR JOSH BERTSCHY IS A VETERAN OF THE COURSE. WHEN IT COMES TO GO-FAST STUFF, I'VE BEEN AROUND. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ROCK-CRAWL STUFF, I DON'T -- MAN, IT'S NEW FOR ME. - WHEN YOU'RE DOING LEDGES... - MM-HMM. - ...YOU NEED TO BE COMMITTED. - YEAH. YOU'RE EITHER DOING IT OR YOU'RE NOT, AND IF YOU'RE NOT AND YOU START BACKING OFF OF IT, THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GONNA HURT YOURSELF. UNLOADING START, COMING OFF -- YEAH. SO WHEN YOU DO A LEDGE, STAY COMMITTED, OKAY? YOU'LL BE FINE. WE'LL FIND OUT. THAT'S FOR SURE. - THANKS, MAN. - THANK YOU. THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT THIS RACE, THE MORE I REALIZE HOW CRAZY THIS IDEA IS AND JUST HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO GET DONE. HOW ABOUT THIS -- WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON SOMETHING, AND YOU... JUST THROW IT UP ON THE LIST SO WE ALL KIND OF ARE ON THE SAME PAGE AND KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. SO, WE GET BACK FROM LUNCH, WE'RE ALL FEELING PRETTY GOOD. WE DECIDED WE NEED TO MAKE A LIST OF THINGS TO GET DONE... - AIR BOX. - WIRING. - WINDSHIELD. - GASKETS. - DRIVE SHAFTS. - STEERING, FRONT SWAY BAR. ...AND THAT'S WHEN REALITY SET IN. UH, DID YOU PUT "SUSPENSION" ON THERE? DO WE WANT TO PUT THAT ON THERE? WELL, IT'S GOT TO GET DONE. K.O.H. IS SNEAKING UP ON US FAST, GIRLS. OUR LIST IS SO LONG, IT'S SCARY. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP OUR HEADS DOWN AND CROSS THINGS OFF. JEREMY'S TRYING TO FINISH THE CAGE UP WHILE I'M FINISHING THE STEERING BOX. BUT EVERYTHING KEEPS GETTING MOVED AROUND TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE SUSPENSION. IT'S JUST A TON OF WORK. Kaufman: SO, THE NEXT BIG "HOORAH" MOMENT IS WHEN IT HAS SHOCKS, WHEN IT'S GOT COOL CARRIERS, BYPASSES, BUMP STOPS, AND WE GET THE AXLES LOCATED UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK WITH THE LINKS, AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND CONNECT THEM, AND THE TRUCK WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SIT ON ITS OWN. THERE YOU GO. Freeman: HEY, BUD, YOU MIND JACKING UP THE FRONT END FOR ME? I WANT TO CHECK SOMETHING OUT. Bowman: OKAY. SO, I'M LOOKING AT THE FRONT END OF THE SCOUT, AND I'M THINKING AT FULL ARTICULATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME CLEARANCE PROBLEMS. SO WE JACKED UP ONE SIDE OF THE SCOUT TO SIMULATE THE UNEVEN TERRAIN, AND SURE ENOUGH IT LOOKS CLOSE. OUCH. LET'S SEE HOW THE FENDER FITS. I MEAN, IF IT'S... IF IT WAS HOW WE HAD IT BEFORE, IT'S BROKE. HOLY CRAP. NORMALLY ROCK CRAWLERS WITH THESE SIZE TIRES, AND -- WE DON'T HAVE FENDERS AND SHEET METAL ON IT. DON'T HAVE FENDERS -- IT'S JUST A TWO -- IT'S A BUGGY, ESSENTIALLY. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S WAY INTO ALL OF OUR SHEET METAL. SO, WHAT WE DO IS WE START CUTTING UNTIL THEY FIT, AND THEN WE... WE GOT TO GO BACKWARDS. Freeman: IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE WHEN YOU LEARN NOT TO GET TOO ATTACHED TO SOMETHING YOU POURED YOUR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS INTO. SO, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SOME SACRIFICES, AND IT'LL HAVE TO BE THESE FANCY FENDERS THAT TOOK FOREVER TO BUILT. I MEAN, JEREMY AND I PRACTICALLY KILLED OURSELVES MAKING THESE THINGS. YOU GONNA DO MINE, TOO? I DON'T KNOW. IF WE HAVE TO. OH, YEAH. YOU HAVE TO. IT'S A... IT'S A LITTLE DISCOURAGING. SORRY, DUDE. RIGHT. , DUDE. - LOOK AT IT GO. - OKAY. YOU GOT A LEAK DOWN HERE. - THERE'S FUEL UP AT THE FRONT. - ALL KINDS OF LEAKS. YOU OUT OF POWER OR WHAT? YEAH, I'M LOSING POWER. GO AHEAD. IT'S STILL ON THE TIRE, THERE. - OH. - THERE YOU GO. YEAH. HOLY CRAP. SO, AS WE WERE INSTALLING OUR COILOVERS, WE QUICKLY REALIZED WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CLEARANCE FOR OUR SUSPENSION TO FULLY ARTICULATE WITH THE 40-INCH TIRES WE WANTED TO RUN. FOR STARTERS, AS YOU CAN SEE, LIKE, IT'S -- IT'S WAY INTO ALL OF OUR SHEET METAL. SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE TO REDO THE FRONT FENDERS THAT JEREMY AND I SPENT THE BEST DAYS OF OUR YOUTH MAKING. BUT IT'S ALSO A REALLY TIGHT FIT WITH ALL OF OUR FRONT-END COMPONENTS. THE PROBLEM NOW IS THIS IS NEWS THAT AARON'S NOT GONNA LIKE GETTING. WE GOT SOME MAJOR CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. WHAT YOU GOT? AT FULL STUFF, WE'RE INTO HERE, WE'RE INTO THE AIR BOX, WE'RE INTO EVERYTHING. BUT IF WE DROP THE UPPER SHOCK MOUNTS DOWN, THAT CHANGES OUR COMPRESSION, THAT MAKES US WHERE WE CAN TURN. WE SHOULD HAVE CROSS THAT BRIDGE BEFORE WE LOCKED THE STEERING BOX DOWN. THE PANHARD BAR CAN OBVIOUSLY DOWN, BUT THE STEERING'S SO TIGHT, MOVING IT DOWN WILL BURN US... - OH, TRUE. - ...AN INCH ON THE BOTTOM. SO, YOU TOLD AARON. WHAT WAS AARON'S REACTION? UH, HE'S KIND OF BUMMED. WE DON'T HAVE THE EXTRA INCH TO BURN, AND SO IT'S A MAJOR -- IT'S A MAJOR HIT. AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT, YOU COULD TELL HE WAS KIND OF... KIND OF FRUSTRATED WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION. Kaufman: AND YOU THINK AN INCH CLEARS ALL THAT UP? Bowman: YEAH. RE-MEASURE IT ALL. LET'S KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH FURTHER DOWN WE NEEDED TO BE. I'M WILLING TO MOVE THIS STUFF ONE MORE TIME. AFTER THAT, WHATEVER THE TIRES EAT GETS SHREDDED. OKAY, COOL. IF IT'S AN INCH, LET'S SWEAR TO IT. SO, AFTER A SPLIT-SECOND DECISION FROM AARON... WE DOUBLE-CHECKED OUR MEASUREMENTS... Bowman: 13½. ...AND IT TURNS OUT AARON WAS RIGHT TO BE SKEPTICAL. MAYBE WE WERE OKAY BEFORE. THE MISTAKE WE MADE WAS WHEN YOU SET THESE THINGS UP, YOU DON'T WANT TO SET THE COIL AND THE SHOCK SMASHED ALL THE WAY TOGETHER. YOU WANT AN INCH OF CUSHION OR SO, SO THAT IF CATASTROPHICALLY, SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN, YOU DON'T BLOW THE SHOCK OUT. WE HAD OUR INCH ALREADY, WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD OUR INCH ALREADY. WE JUST MISSED THAT LITTLE DETAIL. THE OTHER GOOD NEWS IS THE REAR FENDERS ARE FINE. Freeman: BOWMAN, GO TELL HIM. - WHAT YOU GOT? - GOOD TO GO. - ON WHAT? ON HOW MUCH? - EVERYTHING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - HOW YOU HAVE IT IS GOOD. - OKAY. IT'S JUST THE FRONT BODYWORK IN THE WAY, AND WE CAN CUT THAT. TO HELL WITH PUTTING BODIES ON STUFF. I'M OVER THIS. LET'S JUST BUILD RACECARS. WELL, LET'S GO AHEAD AND CUT THE BODY OFF. - SO, NOW... - HOW LONG DID THAT LIP TAKE YOU? A DAY OR TWO AT LEAST... OKAY, A LONG TIME -- A LONG TIME. THE FRONT FASCIA AND THESE TWO FENDERS -- YEAH, IT TOOK ME A COUPLE WEEKS. THANKS. APPRECIATE THAT. AND IF WE JUST LEFT THEM THE WAY THEY WERE, THEY WOULD HAVE JUST GOTTEN RIPPED OFF INSTANTLY. SO WE GOT 23 DAYS TO GET THIS THING TO THE KING OF HAMMERS. AND IT'S FEELING GOOD TO HAVE IT ATTACHED. I'M HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME, ACTUALLY. GOOD JOB. THAT'S SOLID. Webster: SO, IT'S ABOUT DAY 99 ON OUR SCOUT BUILD, AND IT'S REALLY THE CULMINATION OF A BUSY WEEK CROSSING OFF MOST OF WHAT'S LEFT ON OUR LIST, 'CAUSE THE GOAL IS TO LEAVE FOR KING OF THE HAMMERS TOMORROW. AND IF ALL GOES WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE THE SCOUT RUNNING BEFORE NIGHTFALL. Bowman: IT'S VERY CLOSE. I NEED TO PUT FUEL IN IT, FILL THE TRANSFER CASE UP, AND BURP THE FUEL SYSTEM, AND THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIGHT IT UP. HOLY CRAP. YEAH, IT'S -- I FIGURE WHAT WE'RE ALSO GONNA NEED TO BRING IS A LADDER TO BE ABLE TO PUT FUEL IN THIS THING. Rodriquez: LOOK AT IT GO! GULP-A, GULP-A, GULP-A, GULP-A, GULP-A. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. TURN IT ON, MAKE SOME NOISE. DIESEL. WE GOT A LEAK DOWN HERE. OH, SEE, LOOK. THERE'S FUEL UP AT THE FRONT. OKAY, KILL IT, JON. ALL KINDS OF LEAKS. BOY, THERE'S A HELL OF A LEAK THERE. Kaufman: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE TRYING TO TAKE A SHOWER OR GOING SWIMMING, BUT... - BOTH. - ...YOU GOT BOTH OF THEM. - YEAH. THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PLACES IT REALLY CAN BE. IT CAN ONLY LEAK OUT OF SO MANY HOLES. HEY, CAN YOU SEE IT, JASON? Bowman: YEAH. IT'S THE FRONT FILTER. IT'S TIGHT, BUT IT'S LEAKING LIKE A SIEVE. ON THE BOTTOM OF IT? NO, IT'S THE SEAL THAT SEALS THE WATER SEPARATOR TO THE PUMP. AROUND THE TOP OF IT? LIKE, THE O-RING, SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THE O-RING. THE O-RING PROBABLY JUST GOT WATERED UP ON IT. SO WE PULLED THE FILTER OFF TO SEE IF IT WAS THE O-RING. THE O-RING DIDN'T SEEM TO BE THE CULPRIT, BUT WE WENT AHEAD AND OILED IT AND PUT IT BACK ON. REALLY, IT WAS JUST A LOOSE FITTING ON THE OUTGOING SIDE OF THE PUMP -- REALLY GOT IT HANDLED PRETTY QUICKLY. Rodriquez: COMING ON. -OHH! THAT WAS SMART. THERE WE GO. WE GOT HER NOW. YOU'RE MAKING ALL KINDS OF PRESSURE. GET WITH IT, SISTER. OR MAYBE NOT. Bowman: GO AHEAD. THERE WE GO. THAT'S IT. STUPID LITTLE TRACTOR. - IT'S RUNNING. - IT'S ALIVE. SO, YEAH, THE MOTOR'S RUNNING, BUT THIS IS WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD. WE'RE OUT OF TIME, AND THIS THING'S GOT TO PERFORM. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FIND OUT IF IT'LL LEAVE THE SHOP AND COME BACK IN ITS OWN. THAT'S A BIG FIRST STEP TO WRAPPING UP THE TRUCK MECHANICALLY. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS LEFT. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHERE -- WHAT WE HAVE LEFT NOW, SO WE'LL GO FOR A RIDE -- AWFUL EXCITING, AND DEADLINE'S GETTING CLOSE. Webster: I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN DAYS. BUT THE ADRENALINE HAS DEFINITELY TAKEN OVER. ARE YOU READY? YEAH, I GUESS. ALL RIGHT, BOYS AND GIRLS, WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A LAP. ALL RIGHT. THE BRAKES FEEL ANY BETTER? I DIDN'T GET -- HAVEN'T USED THEM YET! WE GOT NO POWER AT ALL. IN FACT, WE'RE UNRESPONSIVE. MOTOR'S... YEAH. THAT'S THAT. MOTOR'S DEAD. WE WANT TO HAVE TO DRAG THIS BABY BACK? UH, CRUSTY RUSTY TO BASE CAMP, WE ARE DEAD IN THE WATER. OH, COME ON. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. YOU'RE GONNA PUSH THIS 5,000-POUND MONSTER? AT THIS RATE, NO MATTER HOW FAST WE GET TO CALIFORNIA, THE RACE IS NOT GONNA BE FUN. Kaufman: SO, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER EARLIER IN THE SHOW WE STOPPED BY A DESERTED TRADING POST AND PROUDLY HOISTED OUR COLORS -- AN ARCLIGHT T-SHIRT. GOOD ENOUGH. LOOK AT HOW PROUDLY IT WAVES. BEST OF LUCK. WELL, BROOKS TOOK A PHOTO AND POSTED IT ON INSTAGRAM -- BEFORE YOU KNOW IT WE GOT THIS PHOTO RESPONSE FROM THOMAS YAZZIE OF GALLUP, NEW MEXICO. HE NOT ONLY LOCATED THE OLD TRADING POST BUT NOW HAS HIS VERY OWN SOMEWHAT COLLECTIBLE ARCLIGHT T-SHIRT. IN NEUTRAL? UM, YEAH, BUT YOU'RE GONNA PUSH THIS 5,000-POUND MONSTER? IF THERE'S ENOUGH OF HERE, IT SHOULD BE NOT A PROBLEM. AT THIS RATE, I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN ANY RISK OF DAMAGING THE TRUCK. SO, I JUST TOOK THE TRUCK OUT FOR A TEST DRIVE, AND IT'S A COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE. Bowman: OKAY, SOMEBODY WANT TO GRAB THE FORKLIFT? AND WITH KING OF THE HAMMERS BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS, NOW WE GOT TO GET IT BACK INTO THE SHOP AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. AIN'T GONNA LIE, IT'S A LITTLE DEPRESSING. I'VE HAD OTHER CARS THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT AROUND THE BLOCK, BUT NOT IN A LONG TIME. THROTTLE IT, GERT MURTHAL. - IT IS -- HERE WE GO. Kaufman: WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO IS GET IT BACK IN THE SHOP THEN TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE DEAL IS. OBVIOUSLY AT THIS RATE, NO MATTER HOW FAST WE GET TO CALIFORNIA, THE RACE IS NOT GONNA BE FUN. Rodriquez: I HONESTLY THINK THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT TUNED AT ALL. I WOULD AGREE. IT'S HORRIBLE. IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING. I TEXTED SAM, AND I ASKED HIM IF I CAN SEND HIM A FILE, AND, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS I'M NOT A TUNER, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO ADJUST. WE COULD -- WE COULD GO DOWN A PATH WE'RE NOT READY FOR. YEAH, AND I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW... IF YOU CHANGE ONE THING IT COULD SMOKE IT. YEAH. WELL, LET'S CALL SAM AND GET HIM OUT HERE A.S.A.P. Kaufman: SO, HERE'S THE DEAL -- WE'RE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT SURE ANYONE ELSE HAS TRIED BEFORE USING A 4BT CUMMINS MOTOR MATED TO A 6L80 TRANSMISSION. OUR ENGINE IS PREHISTORIC AND PROVIDES NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER TO THE TRANSMISSION, AND THE TRANSMISSION IS VERY SOPHISTICATED AND WANTS A TON OF INFORMATION. WE CAN'T GIVE IT THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE, AND WE CAN'T TAKE CONTROL OF IT THE WAY THAT I THOUGHT WE COULD. SINCE WE'RE HAVING SUCH A PROFOUND ISSUE WITH OUR 6L80, I ONLY KNOW ONE GUY THAT CAN GET OVER HERE TONIGHT, SAM MILLER. HE'S GOT A TON OF EXPERIENCE WORKING AND TUNING ENGINES AND TRANSMISSIONS, AND I THINK HE'S OUR ONLY HOPE TONIGHT. HIS PLAN IS TO PROGRAM FALSE INFORMATION INTO THE TRANSMISSION AND TRICK IT INTO WORKING WITH THE ENGINE. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME... ...AND WE'RE ALREADY COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED. SO, HOW MANY HOURS DID YOU SLEEP YESTERDAY? ALMOST TWO. ALMOST TWO? - WHAT YEAR IS IT? - 456. THEY WERE FILMING YOU SLEEPING. YOU'RE MAKING SOME MAJOR CHANGES? YEAH, I HAD TO GO THROUGH AND SET IT UP TO WHERE IT WILL REACT WHEN YOU TOUCH THIS. YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION D4 ON OUR TRANS AT ALL. THIS IS THE FILE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN IT, SO IT'S -- IT HAS -- IT COMMANDS AND ALLOWS 0.4 SECONDS FOR A SHIFT TO HAPPEN. SO, SAM THINKS HE WAS ABLE TO TRANSLATE AND MANIPULATE THE DATA BEING SENT TO THE TRANSMISSION. SO NOW WE JUST GOT TO HOLD OUR BREATHS AND HOPE THE SCOUT TURNS OVER. Mansour: OKAY, WE'RE OVER THE FIRST HURDLE. SHE RUNS. WE JUST BURNED THROUGH THE NIGHT, AND THOUGH WE'RE ALL EXHAUSTED, WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO ANOTHER TEST RUN. WE EITHER MAKE IT OR BREAK IT RIGHT HERE. THERE HE GOES! HEY. LOOK AT THAT. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE SMELL OF BURNING DIESEL IN THE MORNING. A LITTLE TIRE -- TIRE HOBBLE THERE, BUT... IT TAKES IT A MINUTE, BUT IT GETS THERE. Kaufman: THINGS ARE LOOKING BETTER. WE MADE POWER. IT'S NOT ANYTHING LIKE WHERE I WANT IT TO BE, AND I KNOW IT'S CRAZY TO BRING A CAR LIKE THIS TO KING OF THE HAMMERS. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT CAR, BUT IT'S THE CAR WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. A WEEK FROM NOW, THERE MAY BE ZERO TRUCK LEFT. K.O.H. OR BUST! NEXT WEEK... IT'S TIME TO GO FIND OUT WHAT THE TRUCK CAN DO. ...WE FINALLY MAKE IT TO KING OF THE HAMMERS. HERE'S TO GETTING HERE, AND HERE'S TO HOPEFULLY STAYING HERE A LITTLE LONGER THAN... BUT NOT EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN. THAT JUST... THAT JUST HAPPENED. GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! WHEN WE LEFT THE START LINE, WE PUSHED HARD. I MEAN, WE PUSHED REALLY HARD. HOLY CRAP. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DRIVE ANYTHING UP THAT. THIS THING.
