 I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW, I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTER-MARKET TRUNK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HAND-PICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. JONATHAN MANSURE AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE BEFORE WE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE.

 HE'S THE BEST PARTS GUY I KNOW BUT A TERRIBLE MAGICIAN. - THREE OF CLUBS. - WRONG. A CUSTOM FABRICATOR FROM A RACING FAMILY, JOSH FREEMAN BUILT A COMPLETE TRUCK AT AGE 15 AND HAS YET TO RECREATE THE BICYCLE BOOGIE MADE FAMOUS IN THE '80S. Freeman: ALMOST GOT IT. EX-AIRCRAFT MECHANIC TURNED CLASSIC-CAR FABRICATOR JASON BOWMAN IS AN ENGINE EXPERT AND THE CORONA HIGH SCHOOL MOONWALK CHAMPION OF 1987. JEREMY WEBSTER IS AN INCREDIBLY TALENTED SHEET-METAL WORKER. HE'S WORKED ON CARS SINCE HE WAS 13 YEARS OLD AND HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO TRAIN CATS FOR JUST AS LONG. SIT. NO, STAY.

 BAH. A SELF-TAUGHT ELECTRONICS MASTER WITH MORE THAN 15 YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY, JOHN RODRIGUEZ CAN HACK ANYTHING WITH A CIRCUIT BOARD. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL. AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST. I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS TONIGHT... Announcer: HERE HE COMES LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, AARON KAUFMAN. Kaufman: I'M DIVING INTO A FEW NEW ADVENTURES. WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO BE THE GRAND MARSHAL... IF I KEEP THE TIRES DOWN, IT'S GONNA BE EXCITING FOR ME. IF I DON'T KEEP THE TIRES ON THE GROUND, IT WILL BE EXCITING FOR Y'ALL. THEN, MY BUILDERS AND I WILL TURN AN INTERNATIONAL SCOUT INTO A HIGH-PERFORMANCE ON-AND-OFF-ROAD VEHICLE. BUT THE HITCH IS, I DON'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE BUILDING THESE TYPES OF VEHICLES... I'VE GOT TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS. WE'LL PUT YOU BEHIND THE WHEEL AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT. ...AND VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE DRIVING THEM. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WAS WEIRD. WHAT HAVE I DONE? THIS IS GONNA BE ONE HELL OF A RIDE. OH. STEVE MCQUEEN SAID IT BEST -- "RACING IS LIFE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS WAITING." EVERYONE'S GOT A VICE. MY FIX IS HORSEPOWER. WHETHER IT'S IN THE PITS OR IN MY GARAGE, I'M DRIVEN BY THE ROAR OF AN ENGINE AND THE SMELL OF FUEL IN THE AIR. I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY FEW WHERE MY PASSION HAPPENS TO BE MY BUSINESS. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT CALL IT "HARD WORK," BUT I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE. HOWDY. HOW'S IT GOING? - GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? PRETTY GOOD. LOOKING FOR CHRIS. YEAH! TODAY, I'M HERE AT THE LONESTAR AMERICAN FLAT TRACK SERIES. THEY ASKED ME TO BE THE GRAND MARSHAL. WELL, NOT ONLY DID I AGREE, BUT I ASKED IF THEY HAD A BIKE I COULD TAKE FOR A RIDE. HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING? AARON. - GOOD. NICE TO MEET YOU. - NICE TO MEET YOU. Carr: MY NAME IS CHRIS CARR. I'M CURRENTLY THE CHIEF COMPETITION OFFICER OF AMERICAN FLAT TRACK. YOU READY TO GO FOR A LAP, HUH? YEAH. LOVE TO. I GUESS THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU, LIKE, ABOUT A LAP AND A HALF, JUST KIND OF GET A FEEL FOR IT. YOU'RE GONNA BE ON AN INDIAN, ONE OF THE FACTORY INDIANS, 100 HORSEPOWER. - OKAY. ON DIRT, IT WILL FEEL LIKE 200. YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING IN A CIRCLE LIKE THIS BEFORE? WHAT AM I WORRIED ABOUT? WE'RE RIDING A MOTORCYCLE, RIGHT? - YEAH. - IT'S GOT TWO WHEELS ON IT? IT DOES HAVE TWO WHEELS, BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE A FRONT BREAK. OH, MY GOODNESS. WE'LL BE OKAY WITHOUT THE FRONT BREAK. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM, PERSONALLY, RIDE A MOTORCYCLE. MY GOAL IN MEETING WITH HIM EARLIER IS TO TRY AND TO HAVE, MAYBE, A LITTLE BIT OF A SCARED-STRAIGHT MOMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE, BUT I'M HOPING HE ENJOYS THE EXPERIENCE. SO, IF I REMEMBER THE CONVERSATION CORRECTLY, HE SAID "COME OUT HOT, PIN FOURTH GEAR," RIGHT? Man: PRETTY MUCH. HEY DUDE, WATCH OUT, YOU'RE IN MY SHOT. SORRY. THIS IS A DIFFERENT SHOW. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE HERE. YOU CAN EVEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHO'S READY TO SEE SOME GRAND NATIONAL FLAT TRACK MOTORCYCLE RACING? THERE'S AARON KAUFMAN RIGHT NOW. HE'S STAGED UP OUTSIDE TURN NUMBER TWO. SO, YOU KNOW THE REALLY EXCITING PART IS, IF I KEEP THE TIRES DOWN, IT'S GONNA BE EXCITING FOR ME. IF I DON'T KEEP THE TIRES ON THE GROUND, IT WILL BE EXCITING FOR Y'ALL. Announcer: HERE HE COMES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AARON KAUFMAN, ON THE FACTORY INDIAN SCOUT FTR... Kaufman: SO, WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THINGS EASY, BUT THIS THING IS AN ANIMAL. THIS MAKES A LOT OF POWER, AND IT CARRIES ITS WEIGHT LOW, AND IT WANTS TO GO FAST. Announcer: SCOTTY, WE DON'T HAVE ANY RACERS THAT HAVE, LIKE, 2 FOOT OF BEARD STICKING OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HELMET. - IT MIGHT BE A NEW TREND. - IT COULD BE. Kaufman: I MADE ONE LAP, LAP AND A HALF. IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME OTHER THAN EXCITE ME TO GET IN AND PUT A WHOLE DAY IN ONE OF THESE THINGS. LIKE I NEEDED ANOTHER EXPENSIVE HABIT, THIS RIGHT HERE IS GROWING ON ME. Announcer: WHAT DO YOU SAY, YOU GUYS? LET HIM HEAR YOU. Kaufman: NEVER HAVING BEEN ON A FLAT TRACK, IT ALWAYS MAKES ME NERVOUS, BUT I'M ALWAYS EXCITED TO SHARE WITH PEOPLE AT HOME THE THINGS THAT I LOVE SO MUCH, THE THINGS THAT I THINK MAKE ME ME. THEY MAY NOT HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ME THIS PAST YEAR, BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO. YOU'RE NOW KIND OF DOING YOUR OWN THING. COULD YOU ELABORATE FOR US? THINGS CHANGE, PEOPLE CHANGE, AND IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON. SO, WE TOOK A LITTLE BREAK, AND WE'RE BACK IN NORTH DALLAS WITH A NEW SHOP, AND WE'LL LET EVERYBODY KNOW ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE SHOP AND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE PRETTY SOON. OVER THE YEARS AT GAS MONKEY GARAGE, MY BUILDS WERE GETTING MORE COMPLICATED AND I WAS GROWING AS A BUILDER. NOW, I'M STRIVING FOR A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. WE'RE NO LONGER AT THE PRECIPICE. WE HAVE JUMPED OFF. SO, I HAVE SUNK EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE INTO THE NEW OPERATION, WHICH, HOPEFULLY, WILL GIVE ME A STEADY INCOME TO FUEL MY PASSION BUILDS. AND YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS FROM THE PAST THAT I HAD TO SHAKE OFF. THIS IS ALL BRAND-NEW. WE'RE GONNA DO IT A NEW WAY. AND IT REALLY IS AN EXCITING NEW CHAPTER. MAN, THAT'S REAL EXCITING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF FANS THAT ARE GONNA BE SO EXCITED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAKE SOME NOISE FOR AARON KAUFMAN, AND, SCOTTY, IT'S BACK UP TO YOU. BEING A GRAND MARSHAL OF A LONE STAR 1/2-MILE WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE, AND A LOT OF FUN. BUT NOW, IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK. AT ARCLIGHT, WE'RE PLANNING ON MANUFACTURING F100 AFTERMARKET PARTS, AS WELL AS BUILDING DISTINCTIVE CARS TO FACE NEW CHALLENGES. FIRST CAR I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA BUILD IS A LITTLE SCOUT. MY VISION IS TO TURN IT INTO A STREET-LEGAL, OFF-ROAD VEHICLE WITH EXTREME CAPABILITIES. A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, CHRIS RUSSMAN, HE LIVES OUT HERE SORT OF NEAR ME. SO, HE'S LOCATED ME ONE. HE DRUG IT BACK TO HIS RANCH, SO, WE'RE GONNA COME DOWN HERE AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT. SO, HERE WE ARE AT THE RUSSMAN RANCH. OH, MY GOODNESS, THERE HE IS -- THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND. Russman: I'M CHRIS RUSSMAN. I'M THE PRESIDENT OF CYCLONE MANUFACTURING INCORPORATED. I MET AARON ON PIKES PEAK. I WAS UP TO TUNE THE ENGINE ON A HAUL TRUCK FOR A FREIGHT LINER THAT DID THE HILL CLIMB WITH HIM. AND NOW, I GUESS, WE'VE BECOME FRIENDS. - WHAT YOU DOING MAN? - NOT MUCH. SO, TELL ME ABOUT THE SCOUT. - READY TO GO SEE IT? - YEAH, I AM. I DIDN'T SEE YOU SITTING OUT HERE SO... HOPE ON THE BACK. LET'S GO TO THE PASTURE. - OKAY. -HOPE ON IN. WE'LL GO FOR A RIDE. Kaufman: CHRIS WAS A DIESEL PERFORMANCE PARTS SALE GUY, AND DUE TO HIS EMPLOYMENT SITUATION, HE CAN DO A LITTLE MORE DRIVING AND A LITTLE MORE HUNTING THAN I CAN. AND SO, HE WAS ABLE TO DIG UP THE SCOUT FOR ME. THE GUY THAT ACTUALLY OWNS IT IS NOT EVEN HERE, SO CHRIS IS KIND OF NEGOTIATING ON HIS BEHALF. YEAH, THE GUY, HE REMEMBERED IT WAS ROLLED. YEAH. AND THE BENT-UP BODY IS NOT OF INTEREST TO MOST PEOPLE. YEAH, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A FACT. THAT'S A FACT. SO, MY INTEREST FOR BUILDING THE SCOUT IS PRETTY SIMPLE. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THEM OUT THERE ON THE ROAD, AND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A BRONCO, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A JEEP, I THOUGHT THEY WERE REALLY INTERESTING. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE COOL, AND YOU DON'T SEE THEM QUITE EVERYWHERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER? I THINK SHE'S PRETTY DARN CUTE, MAN. "CUTE"? I'M KIND OF SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU USE THAT WORD. YEAH. NO, IT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S NOT IMPOSING. IT'S NOT MEAN. IT'S NOT FAST. IT'S NOT ANYTHING. I THINK "CUTE" IS ABOUT THE BEST WE'VE GOT. IT LOOKS A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN YOUR PICTURES. PICTURES, YEAH. YOU NEED TO SEE THE OTHER SIDE. THIS IS THE GOOD SIZE. THIS IS THE GLAMOUR SHOT. LET'S GO LOOK AT THE BAD SIDE. SO, IT'S HAD A ROUGH LIFE. YEAH. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE RUSTED THROUGH THERE. THE WINDSHIELD FRAME, THOUGH. CHRIS, I THINK IT'S SEEN BETTER DAYS, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? YEAH. I BELIEVE SO. OF COURSE, I WISH IT WAS A BETTER SCOUT, BUT ODDLY ENOUGH, LIKE, NOT A LOT OF BIG HOLES, NOT A LOT OF PIN HOLES. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HAS A LOT OF RUST. IT'S PRETTY GOOD SHAPE FOR SITTING OUTSIDE. OH, THE FLOOR'S NOT EVEN BAD, CHRIS. IT'S AWFUL BEAT UP, BUT I THINK YOU DONE PRETTY GOOD. YEAH. I DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THE MOTOR. QUITE FRANKLY, THE FRAME, I DAMN SURE DON'T, THE AXLES AND THE TRANSFER CASE. AND SO, I MEAN, YOU SAID HE MIGHT HAVE INTEREST IN THE... SO DOES HE WANT TO BUY IT BACK, OR CAN WE MAKE A DEAL ON IT? YEAH. WE CAN MAKE A DEAL. WE CAN MAKE A DEAL, JUST TRADE IT BACK TO HIM. WELL THEN, WHAT WOULD I OWE HIM? WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS FAIR? A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS? WELL, I'LL OFFER HIM A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS, I'LL BET HE TAKES IT. THAT SOUNDS GREAT TO ME. - YEAH. - I'M HAPPY. THIS WILL DO FOR WHAT I NEED 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA SLICE AND DICE AND CUT EVERYTHING OFF OF IT, SO... YEAH. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT DONE. - YEAH. - SEE HOW GOOD YOU ARE. WELL, WE'LL FIND OUT, WON'T WE? I THINK HE'S GOT ENOUGH SKILL TO BACK IT UP. HOPEFULLY, THAT'S RIGHT. AM I CLEARING THE FENDER? - YOU'RE OVER THE FENDER. - DON'T LET ME HIT YOUR FENDER. IT'S GONNA FALL! IT'S GONNA FALL! WE ALMOST DENT IT! OH, GOODNESS. AT THE ARCLIGHT GARAGE, MY BUILDERS REALLY HAVEN'T WORKED WITH EACH OTHER BEFORE, AND THIS IS A BRAND-NEW EXPERIENCE FOR THEM. I'M GONNA HEAD TO DALLAS. - SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. OBVIOUSLY, BUILDING IS NOTHING THEY'RE NEW TO, BUT FOR MOST OF THEM, THIS STYLE OF BUILD IS BRAND-SPANKING-NEW. AND SO, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GEL AND COME TOGETHER AS A PROPER TEAM EXTREMELY FAST, OR YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE BUILD. OKAY. LET'S GO CHECK THIS THING OUT. AARON PULLED IN THE SHOP WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BOX ON WHEELS. WHAT FIELD DID YOU PICK THIS UP IN? Webster: IT'S REAL ROUGH. Kaufman: I CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE CONCERN ON THEIR FACE. Tilton: HE WANTED TO TEST DRIVE SOME CARS, SO WE SET THAT UP FOR HIM. WE WENT FROM NO ULTRA4 EXPERIENCE TO DRIVING AS FAST AS I CAN. Kaufman: SO, I'M ON MY WAY BACK TO THE SHOP WHERE THE GUYS ARE WAITING AND CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO GET THEIR HANDS ON OUR FIRST BUILD. OKAY. LET'S GO CHECK THIS THING OUT. SO, AFTER, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF SUN AND A LITTLE TIME WITH CHRIS RUSSMAN, WE GOT THE SCOUT BOUGHT. MY GUYS HAVEN'T SEEN IT. THEY KNOW THAT I'VE GONE TO GO BUY A SCOUT, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH ELSE ABOUT IT PAST THAT. QUITE FRANKLY, NEITHER DO I. IT'S ON THE TRAILER. WE'LL HAVE IT ON THE FLOOR BEFORE LONG. WELL, THERE SHE IS... - WHAT FIELD DID YOU PICK THIS UP IN? ...IN ALL OF HER DENTED GLORY, LIKE A CARDBOARD BOX. AARON PULLED IN THE SHOP WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BOX ON WHEELS THAT GOT PRETTY BEAT UP. HAVE WE CHECKED THIS THING FOR INSECTS YET? - FOR VERMIN. - FOR BONUSES? OH, I'M SURE THERE'S A BONUS OR TWO IN THERE. Webster: IT'S REAL ROUGH. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN SITTING IN A FIELD FOR, I DON'T KNOW, 30 SOMETHING YEARS. Kaufman: WHAT LITTLE RUST IS HERE, NOT SAYING THERE ISN'T ANY, BUT THE DEAL IS THAT, IT'S ALL STILL THERE, IT'S JUST FULL OF DIRT. HOW MANY TIMES DID IT ROLL OVER? YOU KNOW, I'D BE WILLING TO BET ONE BECAUSE THIS SIDE OF THE TRUCK ISN'T BAD. AND SO, I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET IT TOOK A HIT, AND THEN FLOPPED ONTO THE ROOF. IT ALSO DOESN'T HAVE A ROOF ANYMORE. YOU CAN SEE THAT IT USED TO BE A FULL-TOP CAB. IT'S GOT A HALF CAB IN IT, BUT NO BULKHEAD. SO, I THINK IT JUST HIT THE DRIVER'S SIDE, AND THEN LANDED ON IT. I THINK I FOUND THE CATALYST. OH, YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! EVERY TIME! SON OF A GUN! YOU KNOW, I CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE CONCERN ON THEIR FACE. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE AS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH BEATEN UP OLD ROTTEN JUNK AS I DO, AND I THINK THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING IT, BUT THEY'LL COME AROUND. OURS WON'T BE A WHOLE LOT INTERNATIONAL LEFT, MAINLY JUST THE PAPERWORK AND THE BADGE ON THE DASH. BUT ULTIMATELY, I KIND OF WANTED TO BUILD -- I LIKE THE FACE THEY HAVE, THE GRILLE AND THE HEADLIGHT SURROUNDS AND STUFF. - I LIKE THE HOOD. - YEAH. SO, THE MISSION IS TO SEE IF WE CAN BUILD AN EXTREMELY CAPABLE OFF-ROAD RIG THAT RETAINS ENOUGH CIVILITY FOR US TO HOP IN IT AND DRIVE IT DOWN THE ROAD. NOW, WE DO SO FEW DIESELS, AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT. BUT I HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS. ONE IS THE WAY THAT IT MAKES POWER, AND TWO IS THE EXTREME AMOUNT OF WEIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH IT. SO, THE MOTOR I'M PLANNING ON USING IS A CUMMINS4BT DIESEL ENGINE, BUT WE'RE GONNA USE A COMPOUND TURBO SYSTEM ON IT, WHICH IS BASICALLY ONE TURBO FEEDING ANOTHER TURBO. THE REASON FOR THIS -- WE'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE HIGH-BOOST PRESSURES AND EXTREMELY FAST THROTTLE RESPONSE. SO, THE REST OF THE DRIVELINE BASICALLY CONSISTS OF A 6LE TRANSMISSION, ATLAS 2 TRANSFER CASE, SOME BEEFY 9-INCH AXLES, AND 40-INCH TIRES. THE IDEA FOR THE CHASSIS ON THIS '71 SCOUT IS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A HYBRID BETWEEN ROCK KRAWLER SUSPENSION AND DESERT RACING SUSPENSION BECAUSE I LIKE TO GO FAST, BUT I ALSO LIKE TIGHT, TWISTY TRAILS. BUT ULTIMATELY, THE ONE THING WE'RE REALLY AFTER IS FOR ALL THIS TO LOOK AS FACTORY AS IT CAN LOOK. AND SO, I WANTED TO SEE IF WE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE A COMBINATION OF DESERT RACING, ROCK KRAWLER, AND ROCK RACING. AND THEN, TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS THING ON THE FREEWAY AT 75, 80 MILES PER HOUR AND RUN WITH TRAFFIC. SO, THAT'S THE OVERVIEW, BUT IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE ON THE TRAILER. Y'ALL READY TO GET IT OFF? - LET'S DO THIS! AARON, YOU UPDATED ON YOUR TETANUS? HEY, IN THIS LINE OF WORK, YOU KNOW I AM. Bowman: PULLING SEATS, PULLING CARPET, PULLING TRASH, PULLING DASH. FLOWER POWER. WE ALL DOVE IN HEAD FIRST. IT'S A GIANT TURD BUCKET. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M IMAGINING THE FINISHED PICTURE. Kaufman: I KNOW THAT I'M NOT GONNA USE THE MOTOR. I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA USE THE REST OF THE DRIVELINE OR THE CHASSIS OR THE AXLES. SO, THE MOST PRUDENT THING TO DO IS ACTUALLY JUST GET IT GONE. JASON AND I ARE LITERALLY JUST... Bowman: SCRAPING. BACK WHEN THEY ACTUALLY MADE GLUE THAT WORKED. IT'S GIVING US A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFICULTY. HEY, JOHN BOY, MOVE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. Rodriguez: I'M OVER. TASTES LIKE AN OLD INTERNATIONAL SCOUT. SOMETHING'S ON FIRE! WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BUILD A NEW CHASSIS FOR IT, SO WE DON'T NEED THE OLD CHASSIS. HENCE, WE SEPARATED THE BODY. WE'RE GONNA WORK SOME MAGIC AND MAKE THIS THING A KILLER RIDE. - IT'S A DIRTY JOB. - IT'S GOT SO MUCH DIRT. Man: WE'RE TRYING TO GET ALL THIS OUT JUST SO WE CAN REMOVE THE GAS TANK, BECAUSE ALL THAT DIRT HAS GOT THE GAS TANK JUST STUCK IN THERE. - YEAH! - WINNING! NONE OF THESE GUYS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER BEFORE, BUT THEY'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL TALENTED GUYS, AND THEY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE. IF THIS TOOK US ANY LONGER THAN WHAT IT TOOK US TODAY, THEN I'D DEFINITELY HAVE TO QUESTION MY DECISION ON SOME OF THE GUYS HERE. I LIKE IT MORE ALREADY. - YAHTZEE! AND IT WAS A PRETTY QUICK PROCESS. - DOUBLE TEAMING. - ALL RIGHT. HI. YOU MUST BE JIM. - I AM JIM. - HOW YOU DOING, MAN? Allen: GOOD! SO, I'VE BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT SCOUTS FOR A LONG TIME, AND WE FOUND THIS FELLOW, JIM ALLEN, THAT IS AN AUTHORITY ON IT. HE HAD JUST COMPLETED A SCOUT BOOK, WHICH WAS REALLY COOL TIMING. I HEARD YOU HAVE A RARE SCOUT HERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW RARE IT IS, BUT... LESS THAN 1,500. OKAY. THAT QUALIFIES FOR RARE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT DESECRATING SUCH A RARE BIRD? THIS WOULDN'T BE MY FIRST TIME. MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN I SAW THE COMANCHE TORN DOWN IS, "I WONDER IF HIS BEARD IS LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO STRANGLE HIM WITH IT." DO TELL. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS ONE? WELL, IT'S A COMANCHE, AND INTERNATIONAL LEARNED THAT THEY COULD MAKE MORE MONEY BY BUILDING SPECIAL MODELS. OKAY. AND THIS IS, ACTUALLY, THE SECOND RAREST MODEL. REALLY? I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW RARE THE VEHICLE WAS. IT'S NOT GREAT FOR COMMUTING. IT'S NOT GREAT FOR FREEWAY TRIPS. THIS WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT VEHICLE, WHICH WAS KIND OF A NEW IDEA. - YEAH. Announcer: THE WOW WAGON. THE NEWEST, GREATEST, ALL-PURPOSE FUN RUNNER OF THEM ALL. IT COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL TRUCKS. THE SCOUT APPEARS RIGHT WHEN THE PUBLIC IS READY FOR IT. Announcer: THIS IS A FUN FAMILY, AND WHAT THEY REALLY NEED IS A RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. Allen: FOUR-WHEELING WAS BECOMING A SPORT AND PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE THAT THEY COULDN'T DRIVE EVERY DAY. SO, THEY WANTED A VEHICLE THAT THEY COULD MAYBE USE FOR A SECOND CAR -- SCHLEP TO THE STORE, WHATEVER -- BUT THEY COULD ALSO TAKE IT OUT ON THE WEEKENDS AND GO CAMPING IN IT, GO FOUR-WHEELING IN IT, AND THE SCOUT FIT THAT BILL. Announcer: IT REALLY IS THE WOW WAGON. YOU KNOW, THE LINE-SET TICKET WAS TAPED TO THE FIREWALL. GLUED TO IT RIGHT HERE ON THE BOTTOM? YEAH. THAT'S THE BUILD SHEET. AFTER WE GAVE HIM THE VIN NUMBER, HE WAS ABLE TO LOOK UP AND SEE A LINE-ITEM PULL TICKET FOR WHENEVER THEY WERE ASSEMBLING IT. THIS IS THE LINE-SET TICKET FOR THIS VEHICLE, WHICH ROLLED OFF THE LINE DECEMBER 1ST, 1970. HOW ABOUT THAT? AND WHERE WAS THE MANUFACTURING PLANT FOR THESE SCOUTS? FORT WAYNE, INDIANA. I'LL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY IS, WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE, "WHERE DO CARS COME FROM." AND THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS "DETROIT," BUT IT AIN'T TRUE. WELL, THEY CRANKED OUT SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THESE IN INDIANA, SO... - HOW COOL IS THIS? "DOLL UP SCOUT." - THAT'S OLD TERMINOLOGY. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DOLL SOMETHING UP, MAKE IT PRETTY, RIGHT? WELL, IN 1965, THEY REALIZED THEY COULD SELL SCOUTS FOR MORE MONEY... - OH. SO, THIS WAS THE... - THEY WERE FANCIED UP. SO, THEY STARTED CALLING THEM "DOLL UPS," AND THEN, THAT JUST KIND ON HUNG ON. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. AND ANY TIME THERE WAS A SPECIAL MODEL OR A HIGH-END SCOUT, IT WAS A DOLL UP. A DOLL UP. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. HOW COOL IS THAT? THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE WITH JIM, I HAVE A DEEPER APPRECIATION FOR THE ODDITY OF THE PACKAGES ON THE TRUCK. YEAH. THAT'S THE ORIGINAL MOTOR. HOW ABOUT THAT? WHILE I WAS CONSIDERING TWO OTHER PAINT OPTIONS ON IT, NOW THAT I KNOW HOW RARE IT IS, I THINK WE'RE GONNA COME BACK WITH A STYLIZED, MODERNIZED, ARCLIGHT VERSION OF IT. EVERY MINUTE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT, I'VE ENJOYED IT MORE AND MORE AND MORE. AND ALL THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED, I'M SUPER STOKED ON IT. I'M GLAD. THIS IS GONNA BE AN AWESOME BUILD, I CAN TELL ALREADY. THERE'S A LOT OF SCOUT OWNERS THAT ARE PURISTS, BUT I THINK THEY MIGHT JUST LET AARON LIVE BECAUSE HE'S GONNA KEEP THE ESSENCE OF THE SCOUT WHILE MODERNIZING IT AND MAKING IT SORT OF A SUPER SCOUT. I'M REAL HAPPY TO SEE IT HAPPEN. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO EAT. Man: AM I FILTHY? CAN I GO EAT LIKE THIS? - YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. YOU SURE CAN. - SICK! WE'RE GONNA END UP MAKING THESE WHEEL WELLS MUCH LARGER AND BRINGING THEM BACK. Freeman: BEARDY MCBEARDERSON. WORKING WITH AARON, YOU KNOW, NOTHING IS GONNA GO UNTOUCHED OR UNNOTICED. RIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD, IT'S JUST TOO MANY PIECES. TOO MANY CUTS. JUST LEARNING CURVE. Kaufman: COME ON DOWN. Man: RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GONNA LOWER THE BODY DOWN ONTO THE FRAME, HERE. OH, OH, OH. BUT WE HAVE A FEW ISSUES. THE BODY IS JUST TWISTED ON IT. I GOT TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS. Kaufman: SO, THE GOAL FOR TODAY IS TO START THE PROCESS OF RELOCATING THE WHEEL OPENINGS TO ALLOW TIRES BIG ENOUGH TO TACKLE THE TYPE OF TRAILS THAT WE PLAN ON RUNNING. WHERE DOES THIS THING STAND RIGHT NOW? OKAY, SO, WE'LL CALL THIS SOMETHING NEAR RIDE HIGH. SO, WE'RE LOOKING FOR AXLE LOCATION. SOMETHING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WELL, CAN'T MAKE LEMONADE WITHOUT SQUISHING A FEW LEMONS. CAN'T MAKE A BIG GNARLY SCOUT WITHOUT SAWZALLING SOME FENDERS. I THINK IT'S TIME. Freeman: WORKING ON CARS IS AN ART FORM, FOR SURE. I MEAN, THEY'RE MASTERPIECES WHEN THEY'RE DONE, IF THEY'RE DONE PROPERLY AND DONE RIGHT. BEARDY MCBEARDERSON. SO, WORKING WITH AARON, YOU KNOW NOTHING'S GONNA GO UNTOUCHED OR UNNOTICED. RIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE'S JUST TOO MANY PIECES. - TOO MANY CUTS. - OKAY. SO, LET'S GET THIS TACKED IN, THEN WE HAVE A VISUAL, A TEMPLATE TO WORK OFF OF. - OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHAT WE JUST KIND OF TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE BOTH UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, YOU HAVE KIND OF BRING EVERYTHING, JUST MEND EVERYTHING TOGETHER TO PLEASE HIM. NOT TO PLEASE HIM, I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT. GET HIS INPUT TO FULFILL HIS VISION AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALISTIC IN BEING MADE. Man: THIS ONE IS GOOD UP TO ABOUT RIGHT THERE. - CORRECT. - YEAH. Man: ABOUT TO CUT A NEW PIECE. CHECK IT OUT, RIGHT HERE. SEE ALL THE HAMMER MARKS? A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH, A LITTLE BIT OVERWORKED. Man: THE FLAIR IS WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. NOW, I JUST GOT TO WRAP IT DOWN. FOR THE LAST -- I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SAY -- MANY DAYS. NO, NO, NO, LAST COUPLE MINUTES. JUST A FEW MINUTES. - LAST COUPLE MINUTES. - TV MAGIC. TV MAGIC. Webster: BOOM. IN THE LAST COUPLE MINUTES, WE BUILD FOUR FENDER FLARES. Kaufman: SO, I THINK WE DID A GREAT JOB. I LOVE THE WAY IT LOOKS. AND IF WE HAVE TO BUMP IT UP A LITTLE HIGHER, IT'S JUST WHAT IT IS, BECAUSE I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THE APPEARANCE ON IT. - ME, TOO. - LET'S KEEP ON MUSCLING. - THE HARD PART IS DEFINITELY DONE. - FOR SURE. THEY SAID I COULD FIND YOU OVER HERE. WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? Kaufman: WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF CURRIE REAR AXLES. WE REGARD THEM AS THE BEST IN THE INDUSTRY, AND THAT'S WHY WE USE THEM IN PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING WE DO, INCLUDING, OF COURSE, THE INTERNATIONAL SCOUT WE'RE BUILDING. CURRIE ENTERPRISES SPECIALIZES IN BUILDING HEAVY-DUTY AXLES TO YOUR EXACT SPECIFICATIONS. IN THIS CASE, WE'RE GOING TO NEED AN AXLE THAT CAN TAKE THE PUNISHING ABUSE OF AMERICA'S HARDEST TRAILS. SO, WHEN CASEY CURRIE CALLED ME AND OFFERED ME A CHANCE TO GET MY HANDS DIRTY, I JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO COME OUT HERE AND DO TWO THINGS -- TO BUILD ALONGSIDE THE MASTERS AND SEE THE OPERATION. - WELCOME TO THE SHOP, MAN. - THANKS SO MUCH, MAN! SO, THIS MUST BE THE TROPHY TRUCK FOR THIS YEAR. Currie: THIS IS THE TROPHY TRUCK. GETTING READY FOR THE BAJA 1000 RIGHT NOW. MAN. CAN YOU TAKE ME AROUND? YEAH. THIS IS IT, MAN. I'M CASEY CURRIE FROM CORONA, CALIFORNIA. I RACE EVERYTHING FROM ROCK KRAWLERS TO TROPHY TRUCKS TO SHORT-COURSE TRUCKS. WE HAD A THEORY. WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT, NOT BE THE NORM. WE WANT TO RACE THE BAJA 1000 IN A TROPHY TRUCK. THREE MONTHS LATER, TURN AROUND AND RACE THE KING OF THE HAMMERS. WHICH IS SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS, YOU DEFINITELY DON'T DO BOTH OF THOSE WITH THE SAME VEHICLE. SO, THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING BRAND-NEW. YEAH. LIKE, MID-ENGINE, 70 GALLONS OF FUEL CELL. WE'VE GOT 30 INCHES TRAVEL ON THE BACK. Kaufman: NOW, CASEY KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE HE'S RACED ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND JUST THIS LAST YEAR, BUILT HIS OWN ULTRA4 THAT ACTUALLY FINISHED THE GRUELING KING OF THE HAMMERS. NOW, IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH KING OF THE HAMMERS, THE RACE TAKES PLACE ACROSS HUNDREDS OF MILES OF DRY LAKE BED AND JAGGED VOLCANIC ROCK. WITH OBSTACLES NAMED "DEVIL'S SLIDE," "HELL'S GATE," AND "WRECKING BALL," IT'S NO WONDER THAT IT'S CONSIDERED THE TOUGHEST 1-DAY OFF-ROAD RACE IN THE WORLD. IN FACT, IN PREVIOUS YEARS, ONLY A THIRD OF THE VEHICLES THAT TOOK ON KING OF THE HAMMERS WERE EVEN ABLE TO FINISH. SO, WE'LL GO CHECK OUT A LITTLE AXLE BUILDING? YEAH. LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT. LET'S DO IT. OF ALL THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES THAT I'VE LOOKED AT, THIS ONE RIGHT HERE IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST TO WHAT I'VE ENVISION, OR WHAT I HOPE TO GET TO, FOR ARCLIGHT FAB. SO, DRIVER'S SIDE 23 AND 7/16. YEP. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. BURN HER DOWN. WHOO HOO! THAT IS A LITTLE WARM, AIN'T IT? TOLD YOU. WE'RE USING A MIG MACHINE, WHICH IS A SPECIFIC PROCESS OF WELDING THAT USES THE WIRE BEING FED BY A MACHINE OUT THE END OF THE NOZZLE, AND THE ARC IS HAPPENING THROUGH THE WIRE. BUT WE'RE MOVING HEAVY WIRE SO FAST THAT IT DOESN'T WORK EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IT DOES, LIKE, SAY, IN MY SHOP, WHEN I MAY WELD SOMETHING TOGETHER. BETWEEN THE FIXTURING TOOL THAT'S ROTATING IT, ME TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE SPEED WITH IT, AND THEN, THE SIZE OF THE LOOPS ON IT I'M MAKING, AND THE SPEED THAT I'M RUNNING WIRE AT. MAN, TO SAY I WAS LOST MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT. - DUDE. - RUNNING HOT. YEAH. AN HOUR. YEAH. YOU DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S JOB UNTIL YOU DO IT. YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW FAST YOU GUYS ARE MOVING, 'CAUSE I'VE GOT ONE IN AN HOUR, HERE, AND THEY MIGHT DO THREE. YOU KNOW? - YOU SEE IT NOW. YEAH. OH YEAH, COMPLETELY. HAVING SPENT SOME TIME WITH CASEY CURRIE AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT GOES INTO BUILDING THEIR AXLES, AS WELL AS THEIR VEHICLES, I'VE GOT SOME NEW PLANS FOR THE SCOUT. I COULDN'T BE MORE IMPRESSED. THANK YOU, MAN. WE APPRECIATE IT. YOU MIND BOXING THAT THING UP AND SHIPPING IT TO ME? NO PROBLEM. I HOPE I DIDN'T DIDN'T SET BACK PRODUCTION TOO BAD TODAY. YOU'RE ALL GOOD, MAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. Bowman: YEAH! SO, AARON JUST GOT BACK IN TIME FOR THE METAL TO ARRIVE. SO, THE NEXT STEP IS START BUILDING THE RAILS FOR THE SCOUT. - YOU READY TO DO THIS? - OH, YEAH! LET'S GET WILD. YOU WANT TO GET WILD? DO IT. MAKE THAT SUCKER TURN. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE FRAME RAIL, I WAS REAL HESITANT 'CAUSE I KNEW HOW DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING THE PROCESS USUALLY IS, AND WE'VE GOT OUR BAILEIGH TWO-BY-FOUR BENDER OVER HERE. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THERE'S ONLY, LIKE, FOUR OF THEM IN EXISTENCE. THAT THING IS STOUT. AND THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE AN S. THE FACT THAT WE CAN BEND THE TWO-BY-FOUR, NOT ONLY CAN WE BEND IT LIKE THIS, BUT WE CAN BEND IT LIKE THIS. THAT'S INSANE. YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOURS I HAVE INTO MAKING A FRAME LIKE THIS? SERIOUSLY. IT BLOWS MY MIND THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY STRETCH STEEL LIKE THAT HERE IN THE SHOP. DUDE, LOOK AT -- THIS RIGHT HERE, I DREAMED OF THIS WHEN I WAS MAKING MY FRAME. Man: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? - DAMN, THAT'S CRAZY. - MAN, OH MAN. - THAT'S SO COOL, MAN. - THAT IS COOL. Kaufman: YEP. EASY ON THE HAIR TRIGGER. - YEAH, RIGHT? - IT IS. Bowman: IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH TO ANYBODY ELSE. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST TWO PIECES OF STEEL THAT'S BENT, BIG DEAL. BUT YOU WORKED FOR IT, AND YOU'VE GOT THIS COOL LITTLE DESIGN, AND IT WAS -- IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS. OH, WE'VE GOT A RECEIVER UNDER THERE. Kaufman: SO, RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TEST FIT OUR NEW FRAME TO THE SCOUT'S BODY. WATCH YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW. AFTER TALKING WITH CASEY CURRIE, I FIGURED THE ONLY WAY TO TEST OUR SCOUT IS, ENTER THE HARDEST OFF-ROAD RACE IN NORTH AMERICA -- KING OF THE HAMMERS. THIS IS, QUITE POSSIBLY, THE WORST IDEA, AND THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT I KIND OF KEEP GETTING SUCKED INTO, ARE BIG CHALLENGES. UNPROVEN VEHICLE, UNPROVEN DRIVER, AND SOME OF THE GNARLIEST ROCKS AND CRAZIEST TRAILS. AND THERE'S A TIME LIMIT. WHAT COULD GO WRONG? SHOULD BE REAL TIGHT RIGHT HERE AT THE BACK. - UH-HUH. - ALSO, WE NEED TO POP ALL -- I GUESS I WILL HIT THAT WITH A TORCH, TOO. - YEAH. - THAT END OFF. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL LIFT THE BODY UP. Bowman: WHERE WE ARE IS, HOPEFULLY, ABOUT TO MATE THE CHASSIS AND THE BODY BACK TOGETHER. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GONNA LOWER THE BODY DOWN ONTO THE FRAME, HERE. WE'RE NOT YET READY TO BOLT IT DOWN, WE JUST WANT TO SEE HOW IT FITS. COME ON DOWN. THERE YOU GO, COME ON. AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE OVER IN THE FRONT QUITE A BIT. WANT ME TO SLIDE IT OVER? YEAH. THE WHOLE THING IS, THEN. OH, OH, OH. BUT THEN, THIS ONE GOES CRAZY. THERE YOU GO. COME ON. COME ON DOWN, NOW, SEE IF WE CAN... IT LOOKS LIKE THE FRONT NEEDS TO GO... OKAY. YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THE CAB IS SITTING FUNNY ON IT. Man: WHAT HAPPENS IF I PUSH UP HERE ON AND SLIDE NEXT TO IT. NO. IT'S, LIKE, THE BODY IS JUST TWISTED ON IT. YEAH. IT'S IN THE BODY, OR EITHER IN THE BALANCE ON THE LIFT. YEAH. THIS WHOLE CORNER RIGHT HERE, THIS WHOLE SECTION IS UP, AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU EARLIER. IF YOU WANT TO SEE... IF YOU STAND OUT FRONT AND EYEBALL THE WINDSHIELD FRAME IT HAS -- THE LOWER HALF HAS, UP IN IT. WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THIS THINKING. YEAH. FOR SURE. Man: WE HAVE A FEW ISSUES RIGHT NOW, BUT NOW, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THEM. IF THIS ISN'T IN ANYBODY'S WAY, LET'S LEAVE IT LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW. YEP. HEARD. I GOT TO COLLECT MY THOUGHTS. IT'S JUST, LIKE, WE COULD A, FREAK OURSELVES OUT OVER NOTHING, OR WE COULD MAKE A BUNCH OF BIG CHANGES FOR SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T MATTER. YEAH. Tilton: WE'RE GONNA HEAD UP TO THE TRACK. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF THE RACECARS THAT WE HAVE OUT HERE. WE'RE GONNA DO SOME TECHNICAL ROCK CRAWLING. Kaufman: THAT LOOKS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED FOR MOST VEHICLES TO GO THROUGH. THAT LOOKS LIKE A PAIN IN THE REAR. YOU READY TO DO THIS? Tilton: TURN DRIVER AND BACK UP. UH-OH. MAN. WHAT HAVE I DONE? Kaufman: WE'RE CONVERTING OUR SCOUT FROM A 47-YEAR-OLD FARM IMPLEMENT INTO A MULTI-PURPOSE TRAIL RIG, AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE CHASSIS IS ROCK-SOLID SO IT CAN TAKE ON WHATEVER WE THROW AT IT. THE TRAILS THAT I WANT TO RUN HAVE SOME OF THE GNARLIEST ROCKS IN THE UNITED STATES. I MEAN, BOULDERS AS BIG AS VOLKSWAGENS, AND IT WILL BE THE FIRST THING TO END YOUR DAY. THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHASSIS IS BULLETPROOF. IT'S HOLDING DOWN. THE SCOUT BODY IS TWISTED FROM ROLLOVER. HOWEVER, IT WON'T MATTER MUCH. ONCE I BUILD AND APPLY THE CHASSIS TO THE BODY, EVERYTHING SHOULD STRAIGHTEN RIGHT OUT. THAT'S NOT WITHOUT A FEW OTHER MINOR MODIFICATIONS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO POP THIS OUT, AND THEN PUT A TUBE IN HERE SO WE CAN GET OUR MOTOR PLACEMENT. AND WE'LL TRY TO DO THAT ON TUESDAY. YEAH. YOU'LL BE GONE MONDAY. I'LL BE GONE MONDAY. I'LL BE BACK TUESDAY AT LUNCH. SINCE I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE THE SCOUT TO KING OF THE HAMMERS, I DEFINITELY NEED MORE EXPERIENCE. SO, I'M HEADED TO CALIFORNIA TO GET SOME SEAT TIME IN A REAL ULTRA4. AND THEN, THE SECOND I GET BACK, I'M HEADED TO LAS VEGAS FOR THE SEMA CONVENTION. Man: DON'T SCRATCH IT. SO, THAT'S TWO DIFFERENT WO- TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. DO I FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT? YEAH. COMPLETELY, 'CAUSE THE TRUCK EXISTED IN MY HEAD. SO, ULTIMATELY, I BELIEVE I CAN COME BACK TO THINGS THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE. I THINK THE GUYS WILL ABSOLUTELY KILL IT. BUT IF THEY DON'T, HOW MUCH OF A MORALE SUCK THAT IS AND HOW ANGRY SOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE, OR MYSELF. SO, YEAH, IT IS WEIRD BEING AWAY. I DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN BEING AWAY. IF WE'RE BUILDING CARS, I WANT TO BE HERE. Man: THAT LOOKS PRETTY RACE TRUCK. Man: PRETTY BEEFY. SEEING WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD. Kaufman: UH-HUH. DUDE, WHEN I GET TO THE MALL THOSE PARKING BLOCKS DON'T STAND A CHANCE! THOUGH I HATE TO LEAVE, I THINK THE SCOUT IS IN GOOD HANDS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE HOW THE GUYS DO ON THEIR OWN. Bowman: IT IS MUCHO HEAVY. SO, WITH AARON BEING GONE, IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TONS OF STUFF TO DO. FIRST UP IS A MOCK-UP PLACEMENT OF THE MOTOR AND THE TRANS. INDUSTRIAL INJECTION DROPPED OFF OUR 4BT. IT LOOKS LIKE WE CAN GET IT BACK THERE PRETTY FAR, HUH? YEAH. SET IT DOWN? YEAH. YOU'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO CENTER, I THINK. TOOK THE MOTOR AND TRANS AND DROPPED THE CHASSIS TO SEE IF IT WOULD FIT. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. EASY SKIPPER. IT'S RIGHT THERE. DAMN IT. IT'S REALLY CLOSE. WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE OFF SOME OF THESE CLAMPS AND ROTATE THE TURBO DOWN SO THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARANCE ON THE MOTOR. BECAUSE, RIGHT NOW, THE MOTOR WON'T PHYSICALLY FIT BETWEEN THE FRAME RAILS. THAT WILL GET IT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S GOOD. WHEN THAT THING LANDED -- BLEW MY MIND. SO COOL. THAT'S DAMN NEAR CRANK SITTING OVER THE AXLE. - SHE'S SWEET. - THAT'S PRETTY DANG COOL. SO, THE TRANSMISSION WE'RE USING IS A 6L80E THAT'S BEEN BEEFED UP QUITE A BIT FROM MONSTER TRANSMISSIONS. IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE PUNISHMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA PUT THROUGH IT. WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IS, WE'RE ALL JUST PUSHING REALLY, REALLY HARD AND TRYING TO GET DONE AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF TIME. BECAUSE THE SCOUT'S WINDSHIELD FRAME WAS REALLY BENT, WE HAD TO SALVAGE A STRAIGHT ONE OFF OF A DONOR VEHICLE. BUT IT'S TAKING A LOT OF TIME TO GET THE FIT JUST RIGHT, AND TIME ISN'T SOMETHING WE HAVE A LOT OF. Freeman: NOW THAT THE WINDSHIELD IS INSTALLED, AARON WANTS ME TO BUILD A CUSTOM DASH BEFORE HE GETS BACK. I GUESS I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD. THIS THING'S GONNA BE HAULING ASS THROUGH THE DESERT AND UP AND OVER ROCKS, AND TWISTING. I MEAN, WITH ALL THIS EXTRA STRUCTURE, IT'S GONNA DEFINITELY STRENGTHEN IT UP. Man: I THINK YOU DID A SNAZZY JOB THERE, SIR. HEY MAN, THANKS A LOT. YOU GOT LUCKY, OR YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? WELL, I'M GONNA GO WITH LUCK THIS TIME. Kaufman: WITH ONLY 6 WEEKS UNTIL I COMPETE AT KING OF THE HAMMERS, IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT, IN ORDER TO EVEN SURVIVE THIS CHALLENGE, I WILL NEED TO TAKE A CRASH COURSE ON THIS STYLE OF DRIVING. AND NO BETTER PLACE THAN 4X4 OUTLET. ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS I'M HERE IS, WE DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE, EVER, WITH AN ULTRA4, OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS. SO, I'M HERE TO TEST DRIVE AND ABSORB AS MUCH AS I CAN ABOUT ULTRA4S FROM A GUY THAT IS A SEASONED VETERAN OF THE SPORT. - QUE PASO, MAN? HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? I'M DOING WELL, MAN. GLAD TO BE BACK. I'M BRIAN TILTON. I OWN 4X4 OUTLET HERE IN FULSOM. SO, TELL ME ABOUT SOME OF THESE CARS. SO, THIS OBVIOUSLY, IS THE ONE WE RACE. WHAT'S THE WHEELBASE ON A RACE CAR? - 115. - 115, OKAY. Kaufman: ANY INFORMATION THAT I CAN RECEIVE FROM BRIAN IS INVALUABLE. NOT ONLY DID HE FINISH KING OF THE HAMMERS IN ITS 14 HOUR TIME LIMIT, BUT HE CAME IN IN THE 13TH SPOT. NEVER BEEN TO A HAMMERS EVENT, NEVER BEEN TO AN ULTRA4 EVENT. WATCHED IT ON THE INTERNET LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, YOU KNOW? FASCINATED WITH IT, BUT NEVER DONE IT. SO, THE THING IS, IT LOOKS LIKE -- IN THE ROCKS, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A SPEED THAT IS, THIS IS ABOUT AS FAST AS YOU CAN PHYSICALLY MOVE THROUGH THIS STUFF. SO, THE ONLY PLACE YOU HAVE TO REALLY MAKE UP ON TIME IS IN THE GO-FAST STUFF. IS THAT TRUE OR NOT TRUE? I THINK THE ROCKS ARE THE SPOTS THAT ARE GONNA GET YOU. AND IF YOU OVER-DRIVE IT IN THE ROCKS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE 90% OF THE PEOPLE LOSE IT IS, YOU MAKE A WRONG MOVE, YOU OVERBIND SOMETHING, YOU BREAK A SHAFT, AND SO, IT ENDS YOUR DAY. I'M REALLY EXCITED. SO, WHERE ARE WE HEADED TODAY? WE'RE GOING UP TO PRAIRIE CITY, AND I WILL TAKE YOU FOR A COUPLE LAPS. WE'LL PUT YOU BEHIND THE WHEEL AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, LIKE I SAID, ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS I'M HERE IS, I'VE GOT A COUPLE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT I'VE HAD IN MY HEAD AND FIND OUT THE VALIDITY OF IT. KIND OF FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT THINGS I LIKE AND WHAT THINGS I DON'T LIKE. SO... HE WANTED TO TEST DRIVE SOME CARS, SO WE SET THAT UP FOR HIM TO KIND OF SHOW HIM WHAT THE DIFFERENT VEHICLES CAN DO AND SEE HOW HE LIKES IT, AND YOU KNOW, WHAT HE WANTS TO ADD INTO HIS BUILD. I'M READY TO GO. - ALL RIGHT. LET'S LOAD THEM UP. - LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WE'RE GONNA HEAD UP TO THE TRACK. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF THE RACECARS THAT WE HAVE OUT HERE. WE'RE GONNA GO DO SOME SLOW-SPEED STUFF, SOME MORE TECHNICAL ROCK CRAWLING ON THE OBSTACLE COURSE. THAT LOOKS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED FOR MOST VEHICLES TO GO THROUGH. THAT LOOKS LIKE A PAIN IN THE REAR. AND JUST SHOW HIM, AS FAR AS CHOOSING LINES AND NOT GETTING STUCK AND BELLIED OUT, AND STUFF LIKE THAT. Kaufman: UP OVER THIS, DUMP, OVER THIS, AND THEN, WHEN YOU GET HERE YOU KIND OF TURN RIGHT. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SLIDE THE DIFF PAST THAT. SO, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT IS, LIKE, BASICALLY GONNA TRY AND BUMP THIS, COME UP THE EASY SIDE, AND DROP THE RIGHT TIRE, LEFT TIRE, LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE. AND THEN, YOU GET HERE, AND YOU TURN LEFT. YEAH. AND THEN, YOU SEE THAT ROCK RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU ON THE LEFT -- JUST AIM YOUR DRIVER'S-SIDE TIRE FOR THAT AND STRAIGHT OUT. I DON'T THINK HE HAS DONE ANY OF THE ROCK CRAWLING STUFF. I KNOW HE'S DONE SOME DESERT STUFF. I THINK IT SHOULD BE FUN. YEAH. BIGGER ROCKS THAN ON MY DAILY COMMUTE, BUT YEAH. THE WAY THE CAR IS SET UP FOR ROCK CRAWLING, AS WELL AS GOING FAST IN THE DESERT, IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH. AND QUITE HONESTLY, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. YOU READY TO DO THIS? INITIALLY, IT WAS JUST SUCH A SPACESHIP FOR ME. YOU KNOW, IT JUST TOOK ME A WHILE TO GET COMFORTABLE IN THE CAR. STAY STRAIGHT, LIKE THAT, PERFECT. A LITTLE BIT DRIVER. - WHAT? - A LITTLE BIT THAT WAY. JUST REMEMBER, PICK THE ROCKS THAT YOU'RE GONNA AIM FOR WITH YOUR TIRES. THERE YOU GO. GO BACK TOWARDS THE DRIVER. I HAVE NO POINT OF REFERENCE FOR ULTRA4. IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE I'VE EVER DRIVEN. SO, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WAS WEIRD. PASSENGER. BACK UP ON IT. TURN DRIVER AND BACK UP. OKAY, PASSENGER. UH-OH. MAN. WHAT HAVE I DONE? SO I'M GOING TO SEMA. SEMA IS AN INDUSTRY THING. HE BASICALLY GAVE US ANOTHER LIST OF THINGS TO DO WHILE HE'S GONE. I WANT TO GET THE NUTSERTS, THAT THING IN, BULKHEAD IN THERE, GAS TANK IN, GET THE CAGE IN THERE. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING TO BE DONE THE AARON WAY. GO, TEAM. Webster: THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I FEEL LIKE I HAVE, AND I THINK I CAN PARTIALLY SPEAK FOR JOSH ON THIS ONE, IS JUST LEARNING THE EQUIPMENT. RIGHT THERE EVERY TIME. I KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT. WHY IS THAT HAPPENING? IT'S BEEN A PAIN. IT'S BEEN FUN, THOUGH. A LITTLE BIT OF INPUT ON THIS ONE, 'CAUSE I CAN'T SEE IT. Tilton: JUST GO STRAIGHT WHERE YOU'RE AT, AND THEN, I WILL TELL YOU WHEN TO COME RIGHT A LITTLE BIT. Kaufman: SO, I'M OUT HERE IN PRAIRIE CITY, CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY WAGING A DOWNHILL BATTLE IN AN ULTRA4 VEHICLE. AND THEN, ON THIS ONE, YOU WANT TO GO RIGHT OR... YEAH. WANT TO GO RIGHT. THE PURPOSE? TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF TERRAIN THE SCOUT AND I WILL BE UP AGAINST. WE JUST WANT OUR TRAIL TRUCK TO BE ABLE TO BE CAPABLE OF SUCH PERFORMANCE. DUDE, THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. BOY, IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL. - WHAT? -IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL. YEAH. NOW THAT I KNOW ITS CLIMBING ABILITIES, I WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS ULTRA4 IS CAPABLE OF AS FAR AS SPEED. DID YOU READ MY WORDS OF MOTIVATION? I DID. BET YOU'LL FIND OUT. OKAY, GOOD. WE WENT FROM NO ULTRA4 EXPERIENCE TO DRIVING AS FAST AS I CAN, REALLY, REALLY FAST. FOUR-WHEEL DRIVES ARE TYPICALLY NOT FAST. IF THEY'RE FAST, THEY'RE TYPICALLY NOT FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE. BUT THE ULTRA4 CARS ARE CAPABLE OF HITTING SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 100 MILES AN HOUR. WE'RE DRIVING IT IN FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE, IN FOUR HIGH. EVERY RACECAR I'VE EVER BEEN IN HAS BEEN TWO-WHEEL DRIVE, REAR PUSH. SO, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WAS WEIRD. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THE STEERING IS REALLY HARD TO GET USE TO. THE HYDRAULIC STEERING WAS, HANDS-DOWN, THE WEIRDEST PART OF IT ALL -- JUST THE FEEDBACK ON IT AND HAVING TO WAIT FOR IT. ULTIMATELY, ONCE WE GOT THE SPEED UP AND I GOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT, IT WAS JUST A RACECAR. DRIVE IT LIKE A RACECAR. WOO-HOO! THIS TURN BACK HERE -- YOU WERE GOING INTO IT AND I'M LIKE, "HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO." I FEEL LIKE THE CAR HANDLES SO MUCH BETTER FASTER. YES, FAST. SO, COULDN'T BE MORE IMPRESSED. COULDN'T BE. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF MY IDEAS ABOUT HOW I WANT TO BUILD ARE LINKED TO MOTORSPORT, IT WILL AFFECT THE SCOUT, AND IT WILL AFFECT THE CARS AFTER IT. Man: SO, DOES THIS CHANGE YOUR DESIGN AT ALL? ON A COUPLE SMALL THINGS, ABSOLUTELY. FROM WHERE THE TWO-FRAME IS THAT I BUILT, LIKE, WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BUILD THE BELLY LIKE, AFTER LOOKING AT THE TRUCKS Y'ALL HAD OUT HERE TODAY, THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THE DEPTH ON IT AND LINK LOCATION THAT I KIND OF WANT TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT. I THINK THAT WE COULD DO 70%, IF NOT MORE, OF WHAT THESE PURPOSE-BUILT RACECARS DO, WITH THE SCOUT. SO, THE QUESTION IS, DO I THINK WE CAN FINISH KING OF THE HAMMERS? DO I THINK THAT WE CAN PLAY IN THE SAME FIELD, THE SAME TRAILS? I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. IF THE WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT ON THE ROOF HELP AT ALL... I THOUGHT ABOUT IT NO LESS THAN 5 TIMES. I WAS LIKE, "DRIVE IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT." Man: HEY GUYS, LOOK WHO'S BACK. Kaufman: SO, I'M BACK FROM CHECKING OUT THE ULTRA4S AND I'M FULL OF IDEAS FOR WHAT I WANT DONE TO THE SCOUT. BUT SINCE I'M LEAVING FOR SEMA TONIGHT, THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE. THAT LOOKS GOOD, BUT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I WANT TO GET THE NUTSERTS IN, THAT THING IN, BULKHEAD IN, ON, DONE, FIT IN THERE, GAS TANK IN, THE FLOOR CUT THROUGH, AND THEN, MADE WHERE IT'S NOT JUST A GNARLY CUT, YOU KNOW, IN THE FLOOR. SO, HE BASICALLY GAVE US ANOTHER LIST OF THINGS TO DO WHILE HE'S GONE. ON THE STEERING, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM IN THE CAB, SO WE'LL JUST MAKE IT WHAT WORKS, SO, WE'LL PROBABLY COME OUT OF HERE, AND THEN, WE MIGHT DIVE UNDERNEATH IT SO THAT THERE'S NO INTERFERENCE IN HERE AND COILOVERS AND STUFF. SO, NOW, WE'VE GOT TO INSTALL THE STEERING COLUMN. ON THE FUEL, WHAT WE'LL PROBABLY DO IS, COME OFF THE FRAME WITH A FLAT PLATE. THEN, WE HAVE TO INSTALL THE FUEL SYSTEM. THE BRAKE SITUATION, I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TOSS IT IN HERE, AND SEE IF WE CAN, JUST AS A PLACEHOLDER, START WORKING AROUND IT. NOT TO MENTION, INSTALL THE BRAKES. ON THE CAGE, THE MAIN HOOP ON IT IS GONNA HAVE A KICK IN IT BECAUSE IT WILL GO BEHIND THE CAB, UNDERNEATH THAT LINE, AND THEN, COME UP DOWN THE WINDSHIELD. AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, WE HAVE TO FABRICATE AND INSTALL A ROLE CAGE. GET THE CAGE IN THERE HOWEVER YOU CAN. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO YOUR UP-AND-OVER A AND THEN, OUT THE BACK -- WHOLESALE THE BACK OF THE CAB AND OUT THE BACK. AND THEN, LEAVE THEM, AND THEN, WE'LL CUT THEM OFF AND FIX THEM THERE. SO, HIM GOING AWAY FOR SEMA IS A BIG DEAL FOR US BECAUSE THERE'S SOME CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK OR OVERTHINK, "HOW WOULD AARON WANT US TO DO IT?" I CAN'T SAY FOR ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY HOW TO DO IT. SO, Y'ALL ARE HERE, Y'ALL WORK ON IT. BUT KNOW THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF OPTIONS. I WANT IT TIGHT, TUCKED, AND THEN, WE'LL RIP THE TOP OFF OR DO WHAT WE NEED TO TO FIX EVERYTHING. THAT'S IT. - THAT'S A LOT. - THAT'S A TON OF STUFF. - THAT'S A LOT. - YEAH. OH, YEAH. - BASICALLY, BUILD THE TRUCK. - YEAH. YEAH. Rodriguez: IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING TO BE DONE IN JUST NEXT WEEK THE CORRECT WAY, OR THE AARON WAY. SO, I'M GOING TO SEMA. SEMA IS AN INDUSTRY THING. AND SO, IF YOU ALL MAKE GOOD PROGRESS, IF EVERYTHING IS JAMMING, IF Y'ALL ARE FEELING COMFORTABLE WITH IT, TAKE FRIDAY OFF, TAKE THIS SATURDAY. HE GAVE US THE DAY OFF ON FRIDAY, WHICH WAS NICE, BUT WITH ALL THE WORK WE HAVE TO DO, I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. LET'S GET BACK MONDAY. WE'RE GONNA ROCK AND ROLL. WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO, WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA RUN A LITTLE LATER IN THE EVENINGS ON IT. AND THEN, WHEN I GET BACK, IT WILL BE SATURDAYS AND A LITTLE LATER IN THE EVENINGS, AND THEN, WE'RE GONNA BURN IT DOWN FROM THERE. SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER. I WOULDN'T HAVE PUT THIS GROUP TOGETHER IF I WASN'T COMPLETELY CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITIES. THE GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL WHILE I'M GONE, SO THIS REALLY WILL BE THE ACID TEST TO FIND OUT IF THEY CAN COME TOGETHER AS A TEAM. BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT IN TIME FOR KING OF THE HAMMERS. GO TEAM! OKAY. LINE UP THIS ON FOR ME, JIM. Jim: YES, SIR. GO TEAM. JUST TAKE A PICTURE OF IT. Kaufman: EVERYBODY RUN! ME GETTING THE TAPE MEASURE PROBABLY WON'T MAKE THE SHOW, SO EVERYBODY DOESN'T NEED TO RUN AWAY. HEY! WELCOME TO THE SHOP. Kaufman: NEXT WEEK... SHUT THAT DOOR! MY TEAM AND I HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE HIGHS. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE. IT LOOKS GREAT. I LOVE HOW TIGHT IT IS. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. Kaufman: BUT THE SCOUT FIGHTS US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. Man: IF IT WAS HOW WE HAD IT BEFORE, IT'S BROKE. HOLY CRAP. TRY TO JUST CRANK IT OVER BY ITSELF. GOT AN ISSUE SOMEWHERE -- ELECTRICAL. WE'VE GOT A LEAK DOWN HERE. Man #2: BOY, THERE'S A HELL OF A LEAK THERE. - FUEL SYSTEM IS SPLIT. - SHE'S A GUSHER. Man: YOU CAN'T WRITE THAT, DUDE.
