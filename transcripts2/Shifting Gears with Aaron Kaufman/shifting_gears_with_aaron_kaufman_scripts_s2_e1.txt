 I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HANDPICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. JONATHAN MANSOUR AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE BEFORE WE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE.

 BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL, AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST. I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS TONIGHT... I HAD AN IDEA. I THINK YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME LEARNING TO DRIVE A CAR SIDEWAYS IN GRAVEL. MY BUILDERS AND I EMBARK ON A NEW ADVENTURE. JUST SQUEEZE THE BRAKES. THE BRAKES MAKE YOU TURN. -THAT'S AWESOME. I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO RACE IN THE DIRT. WHOO-HOO! DAVE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING AND RACING A RALLY CAR IN WASHINGTON STATE, AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A RALLY CAR. WHOO! I THINK THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD THIS CAR PRETTY QUICKLY, PRETTY SIMPLY. THAT BEING SAID, THOUGH, THERE COULD DEFINITELY BE SOME PLOT TWISTS. -WHOA! GOT HIM! BIG KID ON A LITTLE BIKE. STUPID. WILLIS IS A FABRICATOR FROM ARIZONA, OBVIOUSLY, WHERE I'M FROM. HE WANTED TO LEND A HAND, SO WHO ARE WE TO TURN HIM AWAY? -YEAH. YEAH. ALWAYS GOT TO COME IN MAKING ALL THAT NOISE? SO... THE SEMI WAS A PAIN IN THE REAR, THAT'S FOR SURE. WASN'T ANY SLEEP INVOLVED IN THAT. NO. WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF HOURS IN THAT TRUCK. YEAH. I KNOW. HEY, YOU KNOW, AND THE SCOUT, WHAT A BIG BUILD. DEFINITELY A HARD FIRST BUILD. GOING TO HAMMERS AND EVERYTHING. - YEAH. - SO I HAD AN IDEA, AND I THOUGHT MAYBE WHAT WE'D DO IS HOP DOWN TO AUSTIN TONIGHT. Y'ALL KNOW MY FRIEND DAVE HAS A RALLY READY RANCH DOWN THERE. COUPLE THINGS. A -- I THINK Y'ALL DESERVE IT. I THINK YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME LEARNING TO DRIVE A CAR SIDEWAYS IN GRAVEL. NEXT THING IS, I KNOW THAT MY DESIGNS, MY THEORY ON BUILDING, CHANGED WHENEVER I STARTED DRIVING FAST BECAUSE I WAS ASKING MORE FROM THE VEHICLE, SO I STARTED DESIGNING AROUND WHAT I WAS GOING TO BE ASKING OF THE VEHICLE, AND I THINK THAT IF NOTHING ELSE, IT WOULD BE FUN, BUT IT MIGHT BE EDUCATIONAL FOR YOU, TOO. SO IF Y'ALL ARE READY, LET'S HEAD TO AUSTIN. - LET'S ROCK AND ROLL. - COOL. - LET'S GO. - YEAH, I'M READY. - LET'S GO. - SEE YA! ALL RIGHT. WHERE WE GOING? WHO'S DRIVING? I'LL DRIVE. NOW THESE GUYS ARE ABOUT TO GET THEIR FIRST TASTE OF RALLY RACING. IT'S A GLOBAL SPORT THAT ORIGINATED IN EUROPE AND NOW ATTRACTS MORE THAN HALF A BILLION VIEWERS. MAJOR RALLIES SUCH AS CORSICA AND MONTE CARLO INVOLVE TIMED STAGES THAT TAKE PLACE OVER A GRUELING 2 TO 3 DAYS OVER A VARIETY OF UNEVEN SURFACES AND PRECARIOUS ROADS. A CO-DRIVER IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL... OVER CREST INTO A RIGHT SIDE DOWN. ...AS DRIVERS NAVIGATE GRAVEL, SNOW, OR ASPHALT WITH ABSOLUTELY NO GUARDRAIL TO PROTECT THEM. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE VERY, VERY HIGH. IT'S LIKE YOU GO UP THERE AND MAKE A MISTAKE, YOU MIGHT COME HOME IN A PINE BOX. ANYBODY GOT DIBS ON ANY OF THESE? WE'VE COME OFF OF TWO VERY DIFFICULT BUILDS. I FELT THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE IN THE SHOP, AND WE NEEDED A RELEASE. WE NEEDED TO GET THE ENERGY UP IN THE SHOP, AND I REALLY WANTED JUST AN INCREDIBLE TEAM-BUILDING EXERCISE. AND SO IN THE U.S., THERE ARE ONLY THREE RALLY SCHOOLS. - WHAT'S COOKING, GOOD-LOOKING? - NOT MUCH, SIR. RALLY READY IS, UH... I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO RACE IN THE DIRT. - HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD TO SEE YOU, BROTHER. - GOOD TO SEE YOU. - YEAH! COME ON IN. MY NAME IS DAVE CARAPETYAN. FRIENDS CALL ME "TEXAS DAVE." MY ENEMIES CALL ME THE WORST, OF WHICH I HAVE MANY. I'M THE OWNER AT RALLY READY DRIVING SCHOOL, JUST OUTSIDE OF AUSTIN, TEXAS. MET AARON AT PIKES PEAK, JUST, YOU KNOW, "HEY, YOU'RE FROM TEXAS? MAN, ME, TOO. THAT'S BADASS." I WAS LIKE, "YOUR BEARD IS BETTER THAN MINE." HE WAS LIKE, "YOUR CAR IS COOLER THAN MINE." AND I WAS LIKE, "DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?" HELMETS, WE'VE GOT A HANDFUL HERE AND A HANDFUL IN THE OTHER ROOM. THEY'RE VAGUELY MARKED FOR SIZE. JUST START SQUEEZING YOUR HEAD INTO SOMETHING UNTIL YOU FIND ONE THAT YOU LIKE YOU GUYS READY TO DO THIS? - THIS IS GOING TO BE SO FUN. ALL RIGHT. SO WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST? - I'M DOWN. - YOU WANT TO GO FIRST? - SURE. - WHOO! THIS IS IT. ALL RIGHT. HOP IN. THE UNIQUE THING WE'RE GONNA DO FOR THESE GUYS THIS TIME AROUND IS, WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY LET THEM DRIVE THE TRACK BEFORE WE'VE DONE ANY TRAINING, WHICH IS TOP FIVE WORST IDEAS I'VE HAD THIS WEEK, AND I'VE HAD A LOT OF BAD IDEAS THIS WEEK. BUT THE GOAL IS GET A BENCHMARK EARLY ON WITH OUR INSTRUCTORS, AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TOWARDS THE END OF THE TRAINING. WE'LL LET THEM DO ANOTHER LAP, AND WE'LL SEE IF THEY IMPROVE. - HERE WE GO. THREE, TWO, ONE, GO! I NEVER SAT FOOT IN A ALL-WHEEL DRIVE CAR ATTEMPTED TO PUSH IT AROUND A CORNER SIDEWAYS. TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, I DON'T HAVE SOME OF THESE SKILLS, AND THAT'S WHY WERE HERE, IS TO GROW THEM. OH, COME ON! COME ON! AND ACROSS THE LINE. ALL RIGHT, HOW DID THAT FEEL? UH, SLOPPY. YEAH, NOT BAD. A LITTLE SLOPPY. AARON'S SORT OF A BLANK SLATE IN TERMS OF HIS EXPERIENCE WITH RALLY. HE'S GOING TO KIND OF HAVE TO RELEARN AND TAKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT APPROACH. MOSTLY WHAT RALLY DRIVING IS, IS IT'S DRIVING. IT'S CAR CONTROL BEYOND THE LIMIT. GOOD LUCK! SO WE'RE GOING TO TEACH AARON AND HIS GUYS EVERYTHING WE CAN ABOUT LEFT-FOOT BRAKING AND CAR CONTROL AND GET THEM COMFORTABLE DRIVING A CAR UP TO AND BEYOND THE LIMIT. ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA ASK YOU SOMETHING REALLY CRAZY. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO BRAKE WITH YOUR LEFT FOOT. WE USE LEFT-FOOT BRAKING TO ADJUST THE ATTITUDE, THE ANGLE, AND THE SPEED OF THE CAR, AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS BY HAVING YOUR LEFT FOOT OVER THE BRAKE AND YOUR RIGHT FOOT ON THE THROTTLE ALL THE TIME. AND BRAKE ON TOP OF THE GAS, BRAKE, BRAKE, BRAKE. SO NOT ONLY IS THE TIMING FASTER, BUT ALSO YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE SMALLER ADJUSTMENTS. TRANSITION. BRAKE, BRAKE, BRAKE. - NO! - THAT'S ALL RIGHT. - HE'S OFF THE TRACK. - UH-OH. THE LIST OF EXERCISE THAT WE GO THROUGH, WE START WITH THE STRAIGHT LINE BRAKING, WHICH IS JUST TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO USE THEIR LEFT FOOT ON THE BRAKES. LEFT FOOT ON THE BRAKE. THEN WE WENT WITH A SKID PAD, WHICH IS TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO LEFT-FOOT BRAKE THROUGH A CORNER. ALL RIGHT. SO SQUEEZE THE BRAKES. THE BRAKES MAKE YOU TURN. - OH, THAT'S AWESOME. - THEN MOVE INTO A FIGURE EIGHT, WHICH IS, LIKE, THE SAME THING WITH A CROSSOVER IN THE MIDDLE, WHICH IS LOW SPEED LINKING CORNERS TOGETHER WITH LEFT-FOOT BRAKING. - WHOO! - THEN WE MOVE INTO THE SLALOM, WHICH IS HIGH SPEED LEFT-FOOT BRAKING. EYES UP DURING THE BRAKE. GO LEFT, STAY ON THE GAS AND BRAKE. GET ON BRAKE, STAY IN IT. GAS, GAS, GAS. THERE WE GO. THAT'S WHERE THESE GUYS ARE REALLY GOING TO START TO GET THE BACK TO COME AROUND, START TO FEEL THOSE BIG SLIDES. WHOO-HOO! TO GET TO BRING NEW FOLKS IN AND WATCH THEM PROGRESS, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT FOR US. LITTLE TOUCH OF BRAKE TO GET IT TO TURN BACK IN. BEING TAUGHT TO ACTUALLY STEER WITH THE BRAKES, IT'S MIND-BENDING, HONESTLY. EVERY TIME YOU FEEL THE FRONT-END WASH, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BRAKE. THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TAUGHT US HERE WILL ALLOW US TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND BE ONE WITH IT. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH FUN SLALOM IS. BRAKE, ALL BRAKE. TURN AND BRAKE. QUICKER ON YOUR STEERING. - YEAH. IT'S REALLY COMPARATIVE TO SLALOM SKIING. SO YOU'RE HERE, THEN YOU'RE HERE, THEN YOU'RE HERE, THEN YOU'RE HERE, AND IT'S ALL BRAKE. THIS THROTTLE PEDAL IS SMASHED TO THE FLOOR. BALANCE WITH THAT THROTTLE -- MORE THROTTLE TO MAKE IT ROTATE MORE, LESS TO STRAIGHTEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, YOU START LISTENING TO YOUR INSTRUCTOR AND THINGS START TO CLICK. IT WORKS. DAVE HAS SUCH AN AMAZING CREW. THEY'VE TAKEN MY GUYS FROM NEVER HAVING DRIVEN A CAR SIDEWAYS TO, QUITE FRANKLY, I THINK PUTTING DOWN SOME REALLY NICE LAPS OUT HERE IN THE DIRT. DID YOU GUYS HAVE SOME FUN? - ABSOLUTELY. - THAT WAS AWESOME, MAN. COOL. WELL, WHO WANTS TO EAT SOME FOOD? THAT SOUNDS GREAT TO ME. - THE FIESTA! - AY, FIESTA! LET'S GO! WOW, I LOVE LEBANESE FOOD. LITERALLY EVERY BITE OF THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. I LOVE IT. YOU KNOW, MY GUYS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE HERE, A, THE LAST TWO BUILDS WERE DIFFICULT, AND WE PUNCHED THROUGH IT, AND SO I WANTED Y'ALL TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. I LOVE BEING DOWN HERE, AND DAVE AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING AND RACING A RALLY CAR IN WASHINGTON STATE. IT'S COMING UP PRETTY QUICK. I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE, SO WE'RE GOING TO TEAM UP AND TRY AND GET MY EXPERIENCE LEVEL, GET MY SPEED UP, AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A RALLY CAR. THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE. I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. NOW, I DON'T WANT US TO JUST BE INCLUDED AND BE HAPPY THAT WE MADE IT THERE. I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE HOW CLOSE WE CAN GET TO THE PODIUM, IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE TO GET ON IT. WELL, WHAT DAVE SAID, WE'LL BE BUILDING THE CAR AND I'LL BE COMING DOWN HERE AND DOING INCREASED TRAINING AND TRYING TO GET FASTER IN IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, I THINK I'M FAST ENOUGH TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYWHERE NEAR THE PODIUM, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT FOR, IS TO SEE HOW WELL WE CAN DO, AND IT'S FROM ALL SIDES. WE HAVE TO BUILD THE RIGHT CAR, I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE IT, AND THEN WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER AN EFFORT IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND THEN TAKE IT HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT MAY BE STUPID, IT MAY BE JUST AMBITIOUS, BUT IT IS, FOR A FACT, WHAT WE ARE DOING. IN JUST 6 WEEKS, WE'RE GOING TO TRAVEL OVER 2,000 MILES TO SHELTON, WASHINGTON, TO COMPETE AT THE OLYMPUS RALLY. COMPETITORS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TAKE PART IN THIS 2-DAY EVENT FEATURING 13 STAGES OF RALLY RACING, WHERE I'LL BE MEASURING MY CAR AND MY DRIVING ABILITY AGAINST FAR MORE EXPERIENCED COMPETITORS. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO SEE GO RALLYING, SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP. I THINK WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT TEAM ON BOTH SIDES TO MAKE THAT A REALITY. - YEAH. IT'S ALL ABOUT DRIVING AND HOW MUCH PRACTICE HE DOES IN ORDER TO GAIN THAT SKILL LEVEL IN ORDER TO BE PART OF THAT, YOU KNOW, 1, 2, 3 PLACEMENT. - THAT'S RIGHT. - IT'S OVERWHELMING. THIS ISGOING TO BE CRAZY, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR. SUBARU HAS A STRONG LEGACY IN RALLY. IT'S JUST THE OBVIOUS CHOICE. MIND IF I TAKE IT FOR A DRIVE? - NOT AT ALL. BROOKS AND I BLASTED AROUND THE STREET A LITTLE BIT. -WHOO! YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS ACTUALLY A SOLID LITTLE CAR. JUST KIND OF START METHODICALLY PULLING STUFF OFF HERE. OH, MAN. LOTS OF RUST. THE DEAL IS, WE'RE GONNA BUILD A GREAT CAR, AND THEN MY JOB IS GO FAST, DON'T DIE. THERE'S DRIVING ON GRAVEL, DRIVING ON DIRT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEDIUM, AND THAT'S ALSO THE DANGER. HAVE YOU BEEN PRACTICING YOUR LEFT-FOOT BRAKING? -YEAH, I HAVE. AFTER GETTING SOME IN-CAR INSTRUCTION FROM DAVE AND HIS TEAM OUT AT RALLY READY, I STARTED SEARCHING FOR A SUITABLE CAR TO BUILD AND RACE UP AT OLYMPUS. I NEEDED A CAR THAT FIT MY EXPERIENCE AND WOULD BE IDEAL FOR THE CLASS I'D BE RACING IN. THAT LOOKS LIKE IT RIGHT THERE. YES, SIR. I LOCATED A SUBARU IMPREZA 2.5RS THAT FIT THE BILL. - DOESN'T LOOK HALF BAD. - DON'T LOOK BAD AT ALL. AND AT 3 GRAND, IT SOUNDS LIKE A FAIR ASKING PRICE. SO BROOKS AND I THOUGHT WE'D COME CHECK IT OUT. - HOWDY. AARON. - HEY. NICE TO MEET YOU, AARON. - THIS IS BROOKS. - HEY. - WHAT'S UP, BROOKS? WE CALLED YOU EARLIER ABOUT COMING TO CHECK OUT THE SUBARU. CAN WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT? YEAH. LET'S GO FOR IT. SO I AM BRADY HOLT. IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO GET THE CAR SEAT FOR MY LITTLE MAN IN THE BACK OF A 2-DOOR COUPE, SO BASICALLY, IT WAS JUST TIME FOR ME TO SELL THE CAR. I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST, IN THE PICTURE YOU SENT, THE RUST IN THE BACK REALLY HAD ME FREAKED OUT. IT IS PRETTY BAD. THE RUST REALLY KIND OF SCARED ME OFF. IT'S GOT OBVIOUS RUST AND THE TAIL PAN. THE TAIL PAN IS EAT UP. IT'S GOT RUST IN THE REAR QUARTERS THAT'S PRETTY BAD, BUT ALL IN ALL, THIS IS PROBABLY THE CLEANEST ONE I'VE SEEN. WELL, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE IT FOR A DRIVE? NOT AT ALL. BROOKS AND I BLASTED AROUND THE STREET A LITTLE BIT, JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING'S AS FUNCTIONAL AS IT CAN BE. SHOCK ABSORBERS MAY HAVE SEEN THE END OF THEIR USABLE LIFE. -YEAH. BUT ULTIMATELY, WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS FIND OUT IF EVERYTHING WORKS WELL ENOUGH TO IMPROVE ON IT, TO BUILD FROM HERE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK IT DOES. THAT'S NOT A BAD TRACK. - THAT'S NOT A BAD TRACK. WELL, WHAT IT DOESN'T HAVE IN POWER IT MAKES UP FOR IN FUN. -THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE A LITTLE ROUGHER THAN I EXPECTED. DO YOU HAVE ANY ROOM ON $3,000 AT ALL? I'VE GOT QUITE A FEW PEOPLE, LIKE, LINED UP AFTERWARD TO COME. YOU GUYS WERE JUST THE FIRST ONES. I BELIEVE YOU. I BELIEVE YOU DO. THIS GUY'S ASKING $3,000 FOR IT, SO IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH ARGUING OVER IT. $3,000 CAR? PRETTY CHEAP. YOU KNOW, I LIKE THE CAR. LET'S JUST DO IT. OKAY, COOL, MAN. I APPRECIATE IT. IT IS THE CAR WE NEED. THE PRICE IS RIGHT. ONLY THING WE'VE GOT TO GET NOW IS GET HOME. I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF HAD AN INTEREST IN SUBARUS. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL-WHEEL DRIVE OR THE AWKWARD STYLING COMPARED TO EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE COOL. BUT ULTIMATELY, THIS IS REALLY, REALLY DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING WE'VE DONE BEFORE. IT'S A NATURALLY ASPIRATED 4-CYLINDER BOXER ENGINE. THE PISTONS FACE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. ALL-WHEEL DRIVE WITH THE MOTOR ALL THE WAY IN THE FRONT. AND LET'S BE FRANK, THIS IS A LATE MODEL JAPANESE CAR, SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY DON'T DO MUCH OF. SO THAT BEING SAID, THIS BUILD, I KNOW WE CAN KNOCK OUT OF THE PARK. ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE TO GET ME TO A POINT WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE THE CAR AT A COMPETITIVE LEVEL, AND THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRIVE A CAR AND DRIVE A CAR AT A COMPETITIVE LEVEL. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M REALLY MOST EXCITED ABOUT. -WHOO! ALL RIGHT, THIS IS ACTUALLY A SOLID LITTLE CAR. IT'S WAY NICER THAN I EXPECTED. YEAH, IT IS. I THINK THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD THIS CAR PRETTY QUICKLY, PRETTY SIMPLY, AND ON A REASONABLE BUDGET, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE A ROAD MAP HERE. WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA RUN THIS IN A RACE WHERE THERE ARE A SET OF STANDARDS. THERE IS CLASS RULES, AND SO THAT'S HOW WE BUILD THE CAR. THAT BEING SAID THOUGH, THERE COULD DEFINITELY BE SOME, YOU KNOW, SOME PLOT TWISTS. IT'S JUST WE KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THEM ARE SUPER AWESOME, AND SOME OF THEM ARE A LITTLE PRECARIOUS. - YEAH. YEAH. BUT ULTIMATELY TODAY, MY GOAL IS TO GET THIS THING BROKE DOWN TO ITS BASE COMPONENTS, DRIVELINE COMPLETELY OUT AND INSPECTED FOR UNANTICIPATED DAMAGE SO THAT WE KNOW WE'VE GOT THOSE COVERED AND NOT JUST HOPE THAT BY THROWING NEW PARTS AT IT, WE END UP FIXING THEM. - YEAH. - YEP. - LET'S IDENTIFY... THE BIGGEST RISK HERE IS THAT WE OVERBUILD THE CAR. THE CAR ENDS UP TOO FAT, TOO HEAVY, AND DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH POWER. NONE OF US ARE EXPERTS ON THAT MOTOR. NO. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WEAK SPOTS ARE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BREAKOVER POINT IS HEN IT STARTS BECOMING JUST A BIG MESS. IT'S GONNA BE A LEARNING CURVE. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, "DO WE BUILD CARS? YEAH. DO WE BUILD THIS CAR? NO." IT'S LIKE, "WE MIGHT NOT BE EXPERTS NOW, BUT ABOUT A MONTH FROM NOW, WE MIGHT BE." SO THE PLAN IS TO, OF COURSE, LIGHTEN THE CAR DRAMATICALLY. IT CURRENTLY PUTS OUT ABOUT 120 HORSEPOWER AT THE FLYWHEEL. I'M HOPING TO GET ANOTHER 50 OR SO OUT OF IT, BUT THE BIGGEST THING IS GOING TO BE BUILDING A SOLID ROLL CAGE. WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD THE MOST EFFECTIVE CAR AND BUILD IT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THE FASTER WE GET THIS CAR BUILT, WELL, THE MORE TIME WE GET TO PRACTICE WITH IT. THAT MEANS THE BETTER I GET DRIVING THIS CAR AND THE BETTER THIS TEAM GETS IN BLOWING THE CAR APART AND PUTTING THE CAR BACK TOGETHER. THE DEAL IS, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A GREAT CAR, AND THEN MY JOB IS GO FAST, DON'T DIE. - MM-HMM. - IT'S TRYING TO DELIVER THIS CAR AND ALL THE EFFORT ALL THE WAY TO THE FINISH LINE AND HOPEFULLY FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE. - MM-HMM. - BUT THAT'S IT, GUYS. IF Y'ALL ARE READY, I'M READY TO BLOW THIS BOOGER APART. - LET'S BEGIN. - ROCK AND ROLL. SO WHAT I'VE GOT OVER MY SHOULDER HERE IS A 2001 RS 2.5 SUBARU IMPREZA. JUST KIND OF START METHODICALLY PULLING STUFF OFF HERE, GETTING FLUIDS OUT. - GOOD JOB, WILLIS. - YAY. THAT'S ONE WAY TO DRAIN IT. YOU KNOW, WE'VE JUST NOW STARTED TAKING IT APART, SO WE'RE REALLY GETTING A FIRSTHAND LOOK AT EVERY INCH OF THIS CAR. -OH, MAN. OFF OUR SHOCK TOWER. LOTS OF RUST. WE'RE HAVING TO DO SOME RUST REPAIR, SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO DO, BUT ULTIMATELY, FINDING THE RIGHT CAR CAME ALONG WITH THAT BURDEN, SO IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE'RE DOING. COME HERE, WILLIS. DO, LIKE, A TOUGH FACE. SHUT UP. COME MAKE A TV SHOW WITH ME. OH, ARE WE REALLY DOING THAT INTERVIEW? - BRO, YEAH. - OH. SURE 'NUFF. THE RUST IS IN THE CAR. YOU KNOW, WE FOUND QUITE A FEW RUST SPOTS, AND A LOT OF THEM ARE REAL STRUCTURAL TO THE CAR. IT DEFINITELY HAS TO BE ADDRESSED, SO NOW WE KIND OF HAVE TO DO DOUBLE WORK. WE'VE GOT TO CUT THAT OUT, PLATE IT, AND THEN PLATE IT AGAIN. WE BUILT THE SCOUT AND THEN WE BUILT THE SEMITRUCK, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT THIS TINY, LITTLE CAR HERE. IT'S PROBABLY THE SMALLEST CAR WE'VE HAD THROUGH THE SHOP YET. OH, THIS THING IS SO CUTE. YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THIS SWAY BAR? IS THAT 3/8ths? I THINK IT MIGHT BE HALF-INCH. YEAH, YOUR WIFE WOULD THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIGGER THAN 3/8ths, MAYBE. - EXCUSE ME? -I'M SORRY. STOP PUNCHING ME! I ACTUALLY FIRST MET WILLIS WHEN HE CAME HERE TO THE SHOP. WE INSTANTLY CLICKED. HEY, DO YOU NOT LIKE IMPACTS OR... SEE, WELL, NOW YOU JUST BROKE IT UP, DUMBASS. WE RIB THE CRAP OUT OF EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME, BUT WE NEVER LET IT GET IN THE WAY OF OUR WORK. -OH! - ARE YOU SCARED? - YEAH, LITTLE BIT. ME, TOO. RIGHT NOW WE'RE DROPPING THE 2-PIECE DRIVESHAFT. -OH, HEY, HEY. - GOT HER. - WHAT THE HELL? HEY, GUYS, YOU CAN JUST CALM DOWN. WE'LL REPLACE IT LATER WITH THE 1-PIECE DRIVESHAFT THAT'S STRONGER AND LESS MOVING PARTS TO BREAK. DROP HER DOWN AND START DISMANTLING THE... - YEAH, THE TOPSIDE OF THE MOTOR. - TOPSIDES. WE'RE ALSO PULLING THE MOTOR SO IT CAN BE COMPLETELY REBUILT. OKAY, LET'S NOT BREAK IT. I REALLY THINK WE HAVE A GOOD ROAD MAP, WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM, AND I THINK THAT WE CAN BLOW THROUGH THIS CAR REALLY QUICKLY. - Y'ALL GOOD? - YEP, CLEAR. KEEP GOING. EVEN IN THE LAST YEAR, WE'VE KNOWN WHAT THE DATE WAS TO GET A CAR BUILT BY, AND WE'VE STRUGGLED TO MEET THAT DATE. IF WE DELIVER THIS CAR LATE, THEN I DON'T GET ANY TESTING IN IT. THE IDEA IS IN 4 WEEKS, I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS CAR RUNNING, DRIVING, RACE READY, GRAVEL DAMPERS, WHEELS, TIRES, BRAKES ON, CAGE IN, SEATS IN, HARNESS IN, ELECTRONICS DONE, DASH BACK IN IT, READY TO ROCK AND ROLL, MAKING NOISE. OKAY. THAT'S IT. UH, HOW ABOUT DINNER? GOOD JOB, GUYS. THAT'S THAT. SO REALLY, WE'RE KIND OF WAITING FOR APPROVAL ON PICTURES. IT'S KIND OF A BIG WAITING GAME. BROOKS IS OUT HERE TO TAKE MORE OF THESE ADDITIONAL BARS JUST IN CASE THEY SAY, "HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?" OH, I WOULD WAIT ON THAT, TOO. HOPEFULLY GET OUR APPROVAL TO GO AHEAD AND WELD THIS CAGE TOGETHER, BUT IF WE DON'T HEAR BACK FROM THEM SOON, THAT COULD BE A REAL SETBACK FOR US. WE'RE RACING AN OPEN LIGHTS CLASS. WE HAVE THE ROOM TO DO ANYTHING WE WANT EXCEPT FOR ADD A TURBO OR SUPERCHARGER TO THE MOTOR. WE'RE ESTIMATING THIS CAR WILL MAKE ANYWHERE FROM 180 TO 200 HORSEPOWER. THE BIGGEST THING FOR US IS WEIGHT. ANYTHING COUNTS OR EVERYTHING COUNTS. WE NEED TO SHAVE ALL THE WEIGHT THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN, BUT WE STILL HAVE TO FIT IN OUR WEIGHT CLASS. I THINK IT'S 2,600 POUNDS, SO WE CANNOT GO BELOW 2,600 POUNDS, BUT WE WANT TO BE AS CLOSE TO THAT AS POSSIBLE. LACK OF WEIGHT IS A PERFORMANCE GAIN. THE LIGHTER THE VEHICLE IS, THE EASIER IT IS FOR THE MOTOR TO ACTUALLY DO ITS JOB. WE'VE TAKEN IT ALL APART BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED UPHOLSTERY. WE DON'T NEED THE INTERIOR TO HAVE A RACE CAR, AND WE'RE BUILDING A RACE CAR. YEAH, SO ONE THING WE WANNA DO IS REMOVE ALL THE SOUND DEADENING. SOUND DEADENING IS A MATERIAL IN THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE THAT HELPS KEEP ROAD NOISE AND ENGINE NOISE OUT OF THE CABIN AREA. SO WE START SCRAPING IT OUT. REALLY, IT WAS TAKING A LOT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT. SO AT ONE POINT, I GUESS WILLIS AND JASON CAME ACROSS THIS DRY ICE METHOD TO GET RID OF THE SOUND DEADENING EASIER, SO I THINK WILLIS WATCHED A YouTube VIDEO - OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - WHAT'S UP, GUYS? TODAY I'M GOING TO BE REMOVING SOUND DEADENING IN THE M.P. SO AFTER YOU THINK YOUR DRY ICE IS KIND OF SETTLED IN THERE, YOU JUST WANT TO GRAB THE SCREWDRIVER... HEY, APPARENTLY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT THIS STUFF. OH,. SO THE PLAN IS, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE DRY ICE, POUR IT ON THE SOUND DEADENING, LET IT SIT, AND IT'LL ACTUALLY FREEZE THE SOUND DEADENING OFF OF THE CHASSIS AND JUST BE ABLE TO PEEL IT RIGHT OFF. THE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT IS ABOUT TO BEGIN. IT'S COLD! EVERYTHING IS SO COLD! EXTREME FROSTBITE, I READ THAT SOMEWHERE. DRY ICE MADE A NICE LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT, A BUNCH OF SMOKE. IT WAS PRETTY COOL. HEY, I'M TRYING TO CREATE SOME CINEMATOGRAPHY FOR YOU GUYS. YOU KNOW, SCRAPE THAT WHILE THAT'S STILL COLD. AND IT ACTUAL HELPED. OHH! DAMN! SAY, BRO, THAT WORKS REAL GOOD. IT ALLOWS IT JUST TO BASICALLY CHIP OFF, JUST AS GOOGLE SAYS, YouTube. WOULD YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE ACTUALLY CORRECT? OH, DUDE, YOU SEE THAT? DID YOU ALREADY GET THAT OFF? YEAH, IT JUST, LIKE, CAME RIGHT OFF. IT HAS TURNED OUT VERY WELL. THE DRY ICE COST US AROUND $80, I BELIEVE, FOR WHAT WE USED. SO MONEY WELL-SPENT, TIME WELL-SPENT. IT WAS A LOT LESS AGGRAVATING FOR US. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A BLACK PLASTIC BAG OF SOMETHING. - IT LOOKS DANGEROUS. - CAGE IN A BAG? CAGE IN A BAG. WE TALK ABOUT DOING THE CAGE. YOU THINK, WELL, WE BEND AND COPE AND CUT METAL. WHY DON'T WE DO IT HERE? GOOD ENOUGH. BUT WHAT WE FOUND OUT WAS THAT SINCE THESE CARS RUN UNDERNEATH SOME FIA STANDARDS, THE HOMOLOGATED CAGES THAT ARE PRODUCED AS KITS ACTUALLY CAN BE PRODUCED MUCH LIGHTER THAN IF WE BUILD OUR OWN. NOW, HOMOLOGATED IS A BIG WORD THAT BASICALLY MEANS THAT THE CAGE MEETS THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS SET UP FOR RALLY RACING -- THAT IS, IF IT'S BUILT RIGHT. TO ENSURE THAT, THE FIA REQUIRES TO SEND A SAMPLE WELD AND PHOTOS TO THE CAGE MANUFACTURER IN EUROPE FOR APPROVAL. SO WE'RE HOPING TO SAVE 100 OR MORE POUNDS BY USING HOMOLOGATED CAGE. THAT 100 POUNDS IS... WAS THAT 10 HORSEPOWER? THIS IS THE SAME CAGE THAT'S IN DAVE'S WHITE CAR THAT AARON DROVE WHILE WE WERE DOWN AT THE RANCH. WE KNOW IT WORKS, AND THIS SAVES US A TON OF TIME. SO JUST PULLING THE CAGE OUT AND DOING A TEST FIT, BUT THE HALO ACTUALLY FITS VERY, VERY WELL. SO THE AMERICAN RALLY ASSOCIATION SETS THE RULES FOR ALL THE RACES THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE RULES STATE THAT WE CAN'T WELD THE CAGE IN PLACE UNTIL IT'S BEEN APPROVED. SO FOR THE TIME BEING, WE'RE JUST GOING TO USE TAPE, MAGNETS, AND GRAVITY TO HOLD IT TOGETHER. ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT. IT FITS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. YEAH. ONE HICCUP IS WE HAVE TO GET SOME WELDS CERTIFIED, AND THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT TO SHIP BASICALLY A SMALL WELDED PIECE ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE POND AND THEN GET CERTIFICATION, AND THEN WE CAN BEGIN WORK ON IT. THIS IS THE TEST WELD THAT I DID. - YEAH. - IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT, WE CAN MAIL THAT IN. YEAH. I THINK THEY'LL PASS IT. YOU MAY SAY, "WHY ARE YOU BUILDING IT THIS WAY?" BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN VERIFIED AND CERTIFIED TO WORK IN THIS CAR. THEY SAY IN AN IMPACT, IN A ROLL, IN THESE TYPE OF OF RACING SITUATIONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE. THERE'S DRIVING ON GRAVEL. DRIVING ON DIRT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEDIUM, AND THAT'S ALSO THE DANGER. I THINK THAT HAVING A TRACK THAT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE THE SAME CORNER AGAIN REALLY, REALLY REALLY DOES RAISE THE LEVEL OF RISK. SO THAT BEING THE CASE, THEY MANDATE THAT WE RUN BIGGER TUBE ON IT AND THICKER WALLS. RIGHT NOW, HE'S TAKING INDIVIDUAL PICTURES OF ATTACHMENT POINTS ON THE FLOOR, DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CAGE. ONCE WE GET THESE PHOTOS, WE'LL SEND THEM OFF AND TRY TO GET CERTIFIED. PROBLEM, IS THOUGH, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT ON CERTIFICATION BEFORE WE CAN START WELDING IT, AND SO WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A HOLDUP THERE. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PARTS FOR THE CAR. WE'VE ORDERED IT, BUT AS RALLY IS KIND OF OBSCURE HERE IN THE STATES, IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET A HOLD OF PARTS. SOME OF THE PARTS COME OUT OF COUNTRY. THE PARTS THAT ARE HERE, PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ON THE SHELF. THEY WAIT TO BUILD THEM UNTIL THERE'S AN ORDER, AND SO ONCE AGAIN WE ARE WAITING. BUT WHEN PARTS LIKE THIS MASTER CYLINDER KIT DO COME IN, IT'S MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CAR, AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO MANY MODIFICATIONS. IT PRACTICALLY PUTS ITSELF TOGETHER. UH, THAT FIT PRETTY GOOD. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT COMES RIGHT THROUGH OVER HERE REAL WELL.WHILE WE HAVE TO BUILD THE CAR, WE ALSO HAVE TO BUILD THE DRIVER. SO I'M HEADED BACK DOWN TO RALLY READY, AND I JUST WANT TO GO OVER A FEW THINGS WITH THE CREW BEFORE I HEAD OUT. WHAT I WANT IS, I WANT THE STEERING TO BE NO CLOSER TO THE COLUMN THAN THE ORIGINAL STEERING WHEEL WAS. PAST THAT, JON SHOULD HAVE IN HIS POSSESSION SEATS IN THE SPUD TODAY FOR THAT, SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT, AND WE COULD WORK ON THE FLANGE AND THE FIREWALL. OH, YEAH, WE COULD START A FIREWALL SHEET. YEAH, AT LEAST THE TEMPLATE ON IT, AND THEN MAYBE GET MATERIAL ORDERED AND THEN KIND OF WORK ON A GENERAL LAYOUT. SO WE'VE GOT THE CAGES COMPLETELY ASSEMBLED IN IT. EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT. WE'VE GOT THE STRUT TOWERS WELDED UP AND BOXED, AND SO NOW, REALLY, IT'S WELDING AND FINISHING THE CAGE, ONCE IT GETS APPROVED. SO REALLY, WE'RE KIND OF WAITING FOR APPROVAL ON THE PICTURES. BROOKS IS OUT HERE TO TAKE MORE OF THESE ADDITIONAL BARS JUST IN CASE THEY SAY, "HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?" OH, I WOULD WAIT ON THAT, TOO. IT'S KIND OF A BIG WAITING GAME. SO MANY OF THESE PARTS COME FROM OUT OF COUNTRY. WE'RE STARTING TO GET PARTS IN SLOWLY. NEXT WEEK WILL BE A BIG WEEK, AND IF WE FINISH ALL THE FAB RIGHT NOW, THEN WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE A CAR BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK, AND THAT'S REALLY THE BIG GOAL. THAT'S IT. SO, I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF NOTHING, BUT ULTIMATELY, IT'S ALL STUFF THAT'S GOT TO GET DONE. - NAH, THAT'S BUILDING A CAR. - YEAH. JUST GETTING A PLAN TOGETHER FOR THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS WHILE HE'S GONE TO DO SOME MORE TRAINING, WHICH IS MUCH NEEDED. WE'VE GOT SOME FIREWALL PANELS TO MAKE AND SOME PACKAGE TRAY AND CLOSE-OUT PANELS FOR THE REAR. HOPEFULLY GET OUR APPROVAL TO GO AHEAD AND WELD THIS CAGE TOGETHER, BUT IF WE DON'T HEAR BACK FROM THEM SOON, THAT COULD BE A REAL SETBACK FOR US. I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING ABLE TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY AND PICK THINGS UP PRETTY FAST. IT'S REALLY KIND OF BEEN A BIT OF A GUT CHECK. UH, THE HIT THE FAN, I BELIEVE IS, WHAT THEY SAY THERE. FEEL LIKE THAT NEEDS TO BE UP HERE NEXT TO THIS BIN, RIGHT? THERE AIN'T NO WAY THAT'S GOING TO FIT UP THERE. - WELL, NOT IN THE BIN. - YES, THAT IS. ...IN THE BIN. OH, YEAH? OKAY. -ISN'T IT? -GET THAT NARRATED. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THE DASH BAR IS ALL YOURS 'CAUSE I'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE SUNROOF. SO WHILE AARON'S OUT AT RALLY READY PRACTICING HIS DRIVING SKILLS, HE LEFT US A LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS TO DO TO GET DONE ON THE SUBARU. STILL WAITING ON THE MANUFACTURER'S APPROVAL FROM THE U.K. TO ACTUALLY WELD THE ROLL CAGE. WE'RE GOING TO DO A FEW EXTRA THINGS ON THE LIST. I'M CUTTING SOME NEEDLESS WEIGHT FROM THE CAR BECAUSE THE ROLLS KEEP US FROM ADDING ANY POWER TO THE ENGINE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS LIGHT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN THIS SITUATION. WELL, THE IMPREZA HAD A SUNROOF, AND THE SUNROOF ADDS WEIGHT. THIS PROBABLY WEIGHS... HMM, I DON'T KNOW, ROUGHLY 25 POUNDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SO WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF IT. I'M GONNA MAKE THIS FLANGE. IT'S GOING TO ALL THE WAY AROUND THE OPENING ITSELF. I'M GOING TO COPY THE OLD SUNROOF. ONCE I GOT A SHAPE THAT I'M HAPPY WITH, THEN WE'LL WELD IT TOGETHER. THIS IS A BEAUTY. I LIKES. ONCE I'M SURE THE FRAME WILL FIT, NEXT STEP, I'M GONNA START MAKING MY TOP PLATE. SO I GOT THIS PREPPED AND I AM READY TO TEST FIT IT INTO PLACE. ALL RIGHT! IT FITS PERFECTLY. THERE WE GO. THIS WILL GO BACK ANOTHER 3/8ths OF AN INCH, IT LOOKS LIKE. SO WE RAN INTO A LITTLE BIT OF AN ISSUE. WE WANT TO USE THE STOCK DASH IN OUR RALLY CAR, BUT WHEN WE TRIED TO PUT THE STOCK DASH BAR IN THE CAR, IT HIT THE CAGE. SO IN ORDER TO NOT MODIFY THE CAGE BECAUSE OF THE FIA RULES, WE WENT AHEAD AND NOTCHED THE FACTORY DASH BAR IN ORDER TO FIT IN THE CAR, AND THEN WE COULD PUT THE STOCK DASH BACK IN THE CAR. WE CAN COME BACK TO IT. - YEP. - YEP. OKAY. NOW THAT ALL THIS IS NOTCHED ALL TOGETHER, THE FACTORY DASH PAD WILL FIT IN HERE. CAGE IS TIDY, WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO. I'LL BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR. EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK OUT. SO WE'LL GO FROM THAT NIPPLE TO THIS SIDE AND JUST SHEAR IT AND THEN MEASURE DOWN TILL YOU'RE SQUARE. WILLIS AND I ARE WORKING ON MAKING A REAR FIREWALL FOR THE CAR. I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE, SO WILLIS HELPED ME, KIND OF GAVE ME POINTERS ON WHAT TO DO. DUDE, GO OVER TO THE SHEET METAL SHEAR AND JUST SHEAR IT ON THAT. WE BASICALLY USED CARDBOARD TO CUT A TEMPLATE FOR THE SIZE AND SHAPE THE REAR FIREWALL NEEDS TO BE. THIS SHOULD BE HALF OF YOUR PANEL IF YOU WANT TO DOUBLE-CHECK THE FIT. I FITTED THE CARDBOARD. THE CARDBOARD FITS PRETTY WELL. THAT DOES LOOK PRETTY GOOD. SO NOW, I TAKE THE TEMPLATE AND USE IT TO CUT THE ACTUAL FIREWALL OUT OF SHEET METAL. THE AVERAGE CAR TODAY WITH A FRONT ENGINE LAYOUT DOESN'T HAVE A REAR FIREWALL BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE TRUNK THAT'S ACTUALLY A FIRE RISK. BUT IN OUR RALLY CAR, WE'RE MOUNTING A FUEL CELL IN THE TRUCK, AND THE RISK OF WRECKING AND PUNCTURING THAT FUEL CELL IS MUCH HIGHER ON A RALLY STAGE AS OPPOSED TO THE AVERAGE RACE TRACK, SO THIS SHEET OF METAL SHOULD PROTECT AARON AND THE CO-DRIVER JUST IN CASE ANYTHING BAD SHOULD OCCUR. J-ROD MADE THESE PANELS FOR US, BUT WE NEED TO PUT SOME ACTUAL STRUCTURE IN THEM. IT'S REALLY, REALLY THIN. WE DON'T WANT IT TO DO THAT WHILE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE ROAD, SO I'M GOING TO DO SOME BEAD ROLLS IN IT WHICH ARE RIGID LINES IN THE SHEET METAL THAT ARE ACTUALLY DECORATIVE, BUT THE REAL PURPOSE IS THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE THE PIECE RIGIDITY, THAT WAY IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY WOBBLE. THESE REALLY THIN LINES, IT'S MAKING MY EYES CROSS. SO THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO WHEN THE PIECES BEAD ROLL IS TO RIVET IT IN PLACE, EXCEPT WE CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL WE FINISH THE ROLL CAGE, WHICH WE CAN'T DO UNTIL WE GET APPROVAL FROM EUROPE, WHICH HASN'T COME IN YET. SO WE'RE BASICALLY IN A HOLDING PATTERN UNTIL SOME EUROPEAN MANUFACTURER GIVES US THE THUMBS-UP, OR WHATEVER THEY DO IN EUROPE. YOU GOT TO GET MORE WILD ON THE ENTRY. - YEAH. - I MEAN, YOU'LL GET MORE CRAZY ENTRY, AND THEN THIS WILL BE EASIER TO GAUGE. BUT, YEAH, WE WANT TO MAKE THE MAGIC HAPPEN BACK HERE. I'M BACK HERE AT RALLY READY FOR MY SECOND ROUND OF DRIVER TRAINING, AND IT'S REALLY COOL TO HAVE BUCKY LASEK PITCHING IN AS AN INSTRUCTOR. BUCKY IS AN ACTION SPORTS LEGEND. CURRENT PRO SKATER, THIS GUY DRIVES RALLYCROSS, GRC STAGE RALLY STUFF. THIS GUY -- HE IS A RACE CAR DRIVER. WE HIT A COUPLE ROCKS, BUT THE OLD GIRL'S HOLDING UP. BUCKY'S GOT A WHOLE LOT MORE EXPERIENCE WITH SUBARUS THAN I DO, AND I THINK THE THREE OF US CAN PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING REALLY EXCEPTIONAL. ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS WANT TO SEND IT? I'M READY TO GET TO IT. NOW, BEFORE RACE DAY, I'LL HAVE TO FIND A CO-DRIVER. BUT FOR THE TIME BEING, DAVE AND BUCKY ARE SITTING IN TO TEACH ME EVERYTHING THEY KNOW. WE'RE GOING TO GO RIGHT INTO STRAIGHT-LINE BRAKING, WHICH IS OUR FIRST EXERCISE WE USUALLY DO. IT'S MOSTLY JUST GOING TO GET HIM LIMBERED UP, COMFORTABLE IN THE CAR AGAIN, FEEL THE INPUTS. REMEMBER THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL IS STIFF AS A ROCK. OKAY, THAT WAS GOOD. HOW DID IT FEEL? BETTER. ONCE HE GETS UP TO SPEED, AND HE'S STARTING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE CAR, WE'LL GO RIGHT INTO THE FIGURE EIGHT AND JUST GET HIM COMFORTABLE STARTING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF LOW-SPEED WEIGHT TRANSFER, START SLIDING THAT CAR AROUND AGAIN. WE'RE MAKING SOME IMPROVEMENTS AND SOME STRIDES IN TERMS OF HIS CAR CONTROL SKILLS. I'VE SEEN THOSE HANDS. ALL THUMBS OVER HERE, AND ZOOM, ZOOM! NOW, WE'RE STEERING! ONCE HE'S UP TO SPEED, AND HE'S FEELING COMFORTABLE, AND HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S A LOT MORE KIND OF ON THE LINE, THEN WE'LL MOVE INTO THE SLALOM. FROM THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU DRIVE THIS TO NOW IS, LIKE, NIGHT AND DAY ALREADY. THE WEIGHT TRANSFER COMING INTO CORNERS LOOKS AWESOME. LET'S TAKE EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING NOW AND PUT IT ON THE SLALOM WHERE IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU THE RESULTS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. - ALL RIGHT. - YOU'VE PASSED THIS TEST WITH FLYING CARPETS. OKAY, GOOD LUCK, HAVE FUN. I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING ABLE TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY AND PICK THINGS UP PRETTY FAST. YEAH. THIS HAS REALLY BEEN KIND OF A GUT CHECK OVER HERE. IT'S LIKE, "MAYBE YOU DON'T PICK THINGS UP AS FAST AS YOU THINK YOU DO." EVERYTHING ON THAT WAS BAD. HE'S HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME LETTING GO AND JUST LETTING IT HAPPEN, RIGHT. LIKE, JUST DEVELOPING THE MUSCLE MEMORY AND JUST BEING CHILL AND LETTING THE CAR CONTROL PART KIND OF COME NATURALLY. HE'S, LIKE, MY TIME IS METERED. AND MY LAP IS METER. I NEED EVERY EVERY LAP TO BE... TO COUNT. I NEED TO GET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER. SO YOU'LL NOTE HERE, HE WAS COMING TOWARDS US, SO THE FRONT OF THE CAR WAS FACING US BEFORE, AND NOW AS YOU'LL SEE, THOSE ARE THE TAILLIGHTS. THE HIT THE FAN, I BELIEVE IS WHAT THEY SAY THERE. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT CORNER IN ANY MOTOR SPORT EVER, I DON'T GIVE A WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, BUT ESPECIALLY NOT IN RALLYING AND ESPECIALLY NOT ON THIS ROUGH-ASS SLALOM RIGHT NOW. MOST RACERS SEE THE SAME CORNER A THOUSAND TIMES, A RALLY DRIVER SEES A THOUSAND CORNERS ONCE. SO BECAUSE OF THAT, WHEN YOU BLOW A CORNER, IT'S GONE. PLAN FOR AARON NEXT TIME? - PROBABLY MORE FISHING. - WE'RE GOING TO DO A LOT MORE FISHING NEXT TIME. - DEFINITELY. CAUGHT -- HOW MANY FISH DID HE CATCH THIS TIME? - HE DIDN'T GO FISHING. - OH, YEAH, THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. YEAH. WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL. OUR PLAN FOR AARON NEXT TIME, WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM... NEXT TIME AARON GETS HERE, OUR PLAN IS TO TRANQUILIZE HIM, PUT HIM IN THE BEDROOM UPSTAIRS, SHAVE HIS BEARD, AND THEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS. - CUT. - THAT'S ALL WE GOT. - ALL RIGHT. - I GOT NOTHING LEFT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN TODAY. - YOU MEAN, YOU ARE. - YEP, YES, SIR. SO A WEEK AGO WE SENT OFF OUR WELD SAMPLE FOR THE CAGE. WE ALSO SENT OFF PHOTOS OF THE CAGE ASSEMBLED TO EUROPE TO GET OUR FULL GREEN LIGHT SO THAT WE CAN FULLY WELD THE CAGE. THE PURPOSE OF THE WELD SAMPLE IS TO ENSURE THAT WHOEVER WELDS THE CAGE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING, MAKE SURE THAT THE WELD'S SUBSTANTIAL IN CASE WE WRECK, IT WON'T FAIL. WELL, WE FINALLY GOT THAT APPROVAL IN BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT DID THE WELD TEST FOR THESE GUYS, SO I'M ONLY ONE THAT'S ABLE TO ACTUALLY WELD ON THE CAGE ITSELF. WE'RE GOING TO WELD ALL THE LOWER OF THE UPPER TUBES SO THAT WE CAN STRAP THE CAGE IN, NOTHING WILL MOVE. THEN WE CAN WELD THE UPPERS, BRING THE CAGE BACK UP, ADD IN ALL THE CROSSIVE PARTS AND GET ALL THOSE WELDED IN. - YOU'RE SO SHAKY. - I KNOW. I'M SUPER SHAKY RIGHT UP HERE. WE'VE REACHED THE POINT WHERE WILLIS HAS WELDED EVERYTHING UNDERNEATH THAT WE NEED TO WELD FOR THE CAGE TO HOLD ITS STRUCTURE. NOW, IT'S TIME TO WELD THE TOPS, THEN WE CAN PUT IT BACK IN, WELD THE FLOOR UP AND START PUTTING THE REST OF THE TUBES IN. THIS KIND OF SUCKS TO SIT SIDELINES. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE ACTUALLY SIDELINED SOMEBODY AND BEEN THE NURSE. I HELP HIM WHEN HE NEEDS IT, SHARPEN A TUNGSTEN OR HAND HIM FILLER ROD OR HELP HOLD IN THE REST OF THE TUBES THAT NEED TO BE HELD IN PLACE, SO HE CAN TACK THEM AND START WELDING THEM. THIS HAS BEEN ROUGHLY 20, 30 HOURS WORTH OF WELDING. IT IS EXCITING. IT FEELS GOOD TO BE NEARING THE END. - SO THAT'S THE END OF, HUH? - SURE, THAT'S A WRAP, SON. - THAT'S IT! - NOW WHAT? WHY NOT TAKE SOME PICTURES OF YOUR WORK? CAN'T TAKE PICTURES. I THINK AARON WILL BE HAPPY. I THINK YOU DID A KILLER JOB. GOOD JOB, HOMIE. IF AARON WRECKS IT, I THINK HE'LL BE SAFE. IF ANYTHING, I THINK WE TOOK MORE PICTURES THAN... THEY REQUIRE 8, WE TOOK PROBABLY 80. WITH THAT DONE, WE CAN FINALLY FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CAR THAT NEED WORK. SEATS, STEERING WHEEL. SUSPENSION, MOTOR, FUEL SYSTEM. I JUST HOPE THAT AARON WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE PROGRESS THAT WE MADE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S THE HARDEST FOR NEW DRIVERS TO ADAPT TO IS, ESPECIALLY YOU, I THINK LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. YOU'RE SO ANALYTICAL WITH THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS. EVERY PART OF YOU IS LIKE, "OH, THIS AND THAT, X AND Y"... SO LET ALL THAT GO. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT CORNER IN ANY MOTOR SPORT EVER. I DON'T GIVE A WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, BUT ESPECIALLY NOT IN RALLYING AND ESPECIALLY NOT ON THIS ROUGH-ASS SLALOM RIGHT NOW. THE GOAL TODAY IS JUST AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN IN AS MANY WAYS AS POSSIBLE. IN RALLYING THERE'S AN OLD SAYING... MOST RACERS SEE THE SAME CORNER A THOUSAND TIMES. A RALLY DRIVER SEES A THOUSAND CORNERS ONCE. SO BECAUSE OF THAT, WHEN YOU BLOW A CORNER, IT'S GONE. PARK IT. SURE, LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO KEEP MOVING, AND FOR AARON, HE SORT OF STARTS TO GET IN THIS LOOP. YOU KNOW, HE'LL PICK SOMETHING AND JUST START TO KIND OF GET STUCK ON IT. FOR ME, IT'S LIKE, I REALLY KIND OF... MY WORST CRITIC AND GET SO DOWN ON MYSELF AND GET SO BENT, GET SO UPSET WITH EVERYTHING THAT IT REALLY JUST KIND OF... LIKE, IT JUST GOES DOWNHILL. SO I WANT TO ADD IN THE INFIELD, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THIS GETS REALLY STRESSFULLY SATURATING, AND WHEN ALL YOU'VE DONE IS THIS, YOU START TO BE LIKE, "MAN!" IF YOU HAVE THE WHOLE REST OF THE TRACK, THEN YOU GET... IT'S SORT OF LIKE A CHANCE TO DECOMPRESS, ADD IN NEW ELEMENTS. CLEAR THE PALATE. - EXACTLY. I SAY THE THREE OF US GO OUT, AND LET'S JUST WALK IT AND SET CONES TOGETHER. SOUND GOOD? I WANT TO DO THREE ON THE INSIDE HERE. WE'RE SETTING UP THE CONES SO THAT AARON IS GOING THROUGH BASICALLY WHAT WE'D CONSIDER SORT OF A GENERIC RALLY STAGE. IT'S BIG AND WIDE-OPEN. THE REASON IT'S SO WIDE-OPEN IS BECAUSE WE CAN MOVE CONES AROUND AND WE CAN SORT OF CREATE A MILLION DIFFERENT TRACKS OUT OF THIS BIG WIDE-OPEN AREA, SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS, WE'LL HAVE FOLKS ALL OVER THE TRACK, AND WE'LL BE MOVING THOSE CONES AROUND PERIODICALLY. THE IDEA THERE IS AARON SHOULD REALLY NEVER DRIVE THE SAME COURSE TWICE. IN A RALLY STAGE, YOU NEVER REALLY SEE THE SAME CORNER TWICE, SO IF HE'S REALLY COMFORTABLE ON A CORNER, I WANT TO CHANGE THAT CORNER UNTIL IT'S SOMETHING THAT LOOKS AND FEELS WEIRD TO HIM, SO HE'S FORCED TO ADAPT. SO NOW, WE'LL TAKE ALL THE CONES THAT ARE HERE. WE'LL HAVE YOU DRIVE IT. WE'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE FEEDBACK FROM OUT OF THE CAR, AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO MOVE STUFF AROUND. I MIGHT EVEN STAND OUT HERE MYSELF LIKE THIS. - OKAY. - YEAH. -LIKE THIS. YEAH.WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS REALLY TYING IN THE SLALOM STUFF THAT HE DID EARLIER WHERE HE WAS REALLY STARTING TO KIND OF GET IN HIS HEAD. WE'RE PUTTING HIM INTO A MORE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT WHERE HE CAN START TO JUST FEEL THE CAR, AND HE'S NOT HAVING TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT GETTING EVERYTHING PERFECT ON SOMETHING HE'S DONE OVER AND OVER. I LIKE -- THERE WE GO. HE'LL GO THROUGH. HE'LL DO A LAP OR TWO. WE'LL MOVE A CONE A LITTLE BIT ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER. IF HE'S NOT PAYING ATTENTION, IF HE DOESN'T KEEP HIS EYES UP, HE'S NOT GONNA SEE THAT COMING. HE'S GOING TO TRY AND DRIVE THE TRACK THAT HE THINKS HE KNOWS, AND IT'S GOING TO CATCH HIM OUT. OH! GOD!!! -WE GOT HIM. NEXT WEEK, WE VISIT A FAMILIAR FACE... - Y'ALL SCARED YOUR CAGE? - VERY. WE HAVE TO HANDLE THAT CAGE LIKE GLASS. OKAY. ...AND DISCOVER SOME DEPRESSING NEWS. DAVE, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO WELD THIS HERE? WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO STITCH THIS STUFF TOGETHER? - OH, OH, NO, WE'VE GOT SOME... - SAME THING OVER HERE. DUDE, THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL THAT'LL PASS. OUR CAGE WON'T PASS TECH. THIS IS THE WORST SETBACK THAT I HAVE HAD IN MY CAREER.
