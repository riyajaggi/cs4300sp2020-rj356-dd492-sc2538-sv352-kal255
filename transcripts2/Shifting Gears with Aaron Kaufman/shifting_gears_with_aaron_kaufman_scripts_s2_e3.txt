 Kaufman: I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HANDPICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL, AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST.

 I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS TONIGHT WE ARRIVE IN WASHINGTON FOR THE OLYMPUS RALLY RACE, AND IT COMES DOWN TO THE WIRE, LAST FEW HOURS, BUT IT'S TIME TO GO. BUT IT'S A ROCKY ROAD TO THE PODIUM... Kaufman: WHOA. ...AS FAILING EQUIPMENT... THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE END OF THAT ONE. BLEW A BROKEN AXLE, CAR IS 100% USELESS. ...AND BITTER FRUSTRATION... NO. OH, THAT SUCKS. STRUT'S ALL PULLED APART. Skucas: DO YOU NEED TO LOSE YOUR IN THE WOODS

 AND THEN COME BACK? - NO. AH! ...THREATEN TO KEEP ME FROM MY GOAL. ALL RIGHT. Skucas: HEY, HEY, HEY! Jared: I DON'T HAVE A LIGHT, BUT I DON'T HAVE GAS EITHER. Bowman: SO THAT ONE IS FULL. NOW THAT ONE IS FULL. ALL RIGHT. IT'S GONNA TAKE A MINUTE. SO JARED AND I ARE WRAPPING UP OUR SUBARU RALLY CAR'S FUEL SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN GET IT STARTED AND RUNNING SMOOTHLY SO THAT WE CAN TAKE IT UP TO OLYMPUS IN WASHINGTON FOR THE RALLY. SPEAKING OF WRAPPING, THE GUYS AT SKINZ FINISHED UP THE SUBARU WRAP THIS MORNING, AND IT LOOKS MEAN, BUT IT HASN'T EXACTLY BEEN SMOOTH SAILING TO GET TO THIS POINT. Kaufman: THAT LOOKS LIKE IT RIGHT THERE. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, AARON BOUGHT THIS 2001 SUBARU RS TO BUILD INTO A RALLY CAR. HOPE YOU DON'T MIND TOO MUCH, WE'RE MAKING IT A RACECAR. THE GOAL WAS TO HAVE THE CAR READY IN TIME TO GO COMPETE UP IN THE OLYMPUS RALLY IN WASHINGTON. WE EXPECTED IT TO BE A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUILD. OKAY, LET'S NOT BREAK IT. BUT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE OFF ON THAT. BECAUSE RALLY RACING IS A DANGEROUS SPORT, THERE'S A LOT OF RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT GO INTO BUILDING A RALLY CAR, AND WE MANAGED TO HIT SOME OF THE BIGGER BUMPS IN THE ROAD. OUR TWO BIGGEST CONCERNS WERE THE WELDS ON THE ROLL CAGE... THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL THAT'LL PASS. OUR CAGE WON'T PASS TECH. THIS IS THE WORST SETBACK THAT I HAVE HAD IN MY CAREER. Bowman: ...AND THE FITMENT OF OUR FRONT STRUTS. Kaufman: I GOT A THREE-FINGER GAP. THAT SHOULD BE, LIKE, NO-FINGER GAP. SO WHILE WE FIX THOSE ISSUES... GOOD, TIDY, TIDY, TIDY, TIDY, TIDY. ...AARON WENT TO WORK TRAINING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A RALLY CAR. OH, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. A BIG PART OF RALLY RACING IS HAVING A CO-DRIVER WHO BASICALLY ACTS AS THE NAVIGATOR TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH ALL THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF THE RALLY STAGE. Skucas: OVER CREST INTO A RIGHT-SIDE DOWN, NO CUT. SO ONCE AARON WAS FEELING REALLY COMFORTABLE BEHIND THE WHEEL, HE ENLISTED ONE OF THE BEST, KRISTA SKUCAS. I'VE HAD A FEW DRIVERS. I MEAN, IT'S JUST ADAPTING TO PEOPLE'S PERSONALITY STYLE, LEARNING STYLE AND HOW THEY REACT TO SOMETHING. BUT THE FIXES OUR SUBARU NEEDED MEANT AARON COULDN'T PUT THE CAR THROUGH ITS PACES WITH KRISTA IN THE CO-DRIVER SEAT, SO NOW THERE'S NO REST FOR THE WEARY AS WE HAVE TO GET THIS CAR BUTTONED UP, READY TO LEAVE FOR WASHINGTON TONIGHT. WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY, J-ROD? Jared: IT STARTED. SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO. THE ONLY THING THAT'S LEFT, AARON WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE OUT THE SHOCKS AND SPRINGS ONCE WE GET TO WASHINGTON. WHO WANTS THE FORKLIFT? I'M GONNA GO GRAB TOOLS. - OKAY. I THINK IT'S, LIKE, 8:00 SOMETHING NOW. WE'RE ALL READY TO GET ON THE ROAD OBVIOUSLY, SO ONCE WE GET ALL THIS STUFF STUFFED INTO THESE TOOLBOXES HERE AND THEN LOAD THE CAR AND GET ON THE ROAD. Kaufman: SO HERE WE ARE, SUNDAY NIGHT. WE HAVE A LONG DRIVE AHEAD OF US. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT 36, 38 HOURS OF TRAVEL TIME, AND THEN GET IN ON TUESDAY NIGHT VERY LATE, WEDNESDAY, DO SOME TESTING AT NAMELESS, DO THE SUSPENSIONS CHANGEOVER, ADJUST THE CAR'S SETUP, WEDNESDAY NIGHT, DO SOME MORE WORK WITH KRISTA, THURSDAY, REGISTRATION, FRIDAY, RECCE. SATURDAY MORNING, 9:30, FIRST CAR IS OFF, AND SO IT IS GOING TO BE A WILD WEEK. SEE YOU THERE. Bowman: COOL. YOU BOYS GOT IT? Webster: WE'RE IN WASHINGTON. IT'S VERY EXCITING THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE. WE ROTATED BETWEEN DRIVERS, AND IT WAS ROUGH. I'M SORRY. I'M JUST TIRED. I'M REALLY TIRED. I'M SHAKING A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT'S DONE. IT'S HERE. Kaufman: WE'RE AT NAMELESS PERFORMANCE, AND WE'RE USING THIS AS A HOME FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW, JUST TO FINISH THE CAR, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OKAY, AND WE'RE FINISHING UP ON THE LAST LITTLE BIT OF TOUCHES THAT ARE GONNA MAKE THIS CAR WORK RIGHT, DO WHAT IT HAS TO DO, AND HOPEFULLY DO REALLY WELL ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. - HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS? - WHAT'S GOING ON? - WHAT'S HAPPENING? - HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD, GOOD, NICE TO SEE YOU. - WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS? I'M JOHN. WELL, I'M JOHN HOYENGA. I'M ONE OF THE OWNERS HERE AT NAMELESS PERFORMANCE. WE'RE A MANUFACTURING COMPANY IN WOODLAND, WASHINGTON. WE'RE PRETTY WELL-KNOWN IN THE RALLY COMMUNITY. WE HAD DAVE GET IN TOUCH WITH US ABOUT AARON WANTING TO COME RALLY, SO I TOLD DAVE, LIKE, "YEAH, I GUESS. YEAH, WE CAN HELP. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT." WE'RE ALL READY FOR YOU. WELL, I SAY, IF... WE'RE PARKED OUT BACK. IF YOU'RE OKAY, WE'LL GO AHEAD AND DROP THE DOOR AND BRING THE CAR IN IF YOU'RE DOWN. YEAH, JUST DO SOME DOUGHNUTS OUT IN THE GRAVEL LOT BEFORE YOU COME IN. - JUST WARM IT UP NICE? - YES. - YEAH, EXACTLY. ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE DAMPERS. OUR DAMPER SITUATION, OUR SHOCKS AND SPRINGS 100% FELL APART BACK IN DALLAS. THAT BEING THE CASE, WE NEEDED SOMETHING ELSE. THESE RIGHT HERE, I THINK YOU COULD GET SOME WORK DONE ON THEM, BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS A RACEABLE STRUT SET. THEY'D BE SHOT BY THE END OF THE RALLY. WE WILL DEFINITELY GET YOU SQUARED AWAY... - YEAH. - ...SOME PROPER SETUP. YEAH, THAT'S IT, MAN. - COMING YOUR WAY. - COMING DOWN LOW. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TODAY IS TAKE THOSE COILOVERS OFF, PUT SOME GOOD SUSPENSION ON THE CAR BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ALL IT HAS ON IT IS STOCK STI COILOVERS, AND THAT WON'T MAKE IT THROUGH A WHOLE RALLY, ESPECIALLY NOT UP AT OLYMPUS. SO THESE ARE THE OLD-STYLE DMS 50s, SO IT'S A 50-MILLIMETER PROPER GRAVEL SETUP. YOU NEED GOOD COILOVERS FOR RALLY. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF, WHEELS WILL LITERALLY FALL OFF THE CAR. Kaufman: BEING THAT I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, WHATEVER THEY SAY IS GOLD. IT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, AND SO THE DEAL IS, THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES TO LOSE THIS RACE AND NOT TOO MANY PLACES TO WIN THIS RACE. - LOOK AT THAT. - NICE. THAT'S PROPER. SO WE HAVE THE PROPER DAMPERS ON THE CAR NOW, AND ULTIMATELY, AT THE END, IT'S ALWAYS VERY CLOSE. IT'S ALWAYS VERY TIGHT, AND IT COMES DOWN TO THE WIRE THE LAST FEW HOURS, BUT IT'S TIME TO GO. AND BECAUSE OF THE SETBACKS, THE CAR HAS YET TO GET A PROPER SHAKEDOWN, SO WE'RE HITTING UP A LOCAL LOGGING ROAD TO DO JUST THAT. NAMELESS FOUND US A REAL RALLY STAGE THAT HAD THE SAME TYPE OF TERRAIN THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND AT OLYMPUS, AND THEY EVEN PROVIDED A TEMPORARY CO-DRIVER. 50, A RIGHT 4 UP HERE. NAMELESS HAD ALREADY WRITTEN NOTES FOR IT. THEY HAD ALREADY BLOCKED IT OFF, SO THEY HAD SET UP A TRAINING AREA FOR US. KEEP GOING, 30. THERE'S GONNA BE A LEFT 3 MINUS INTO A RIGHT 3. HERE YOU GO. HERE'S YOUR RIGHT 3. YOU'RE GONNA STAY TO THE RIGHT OF THE ROAD. AND SO WE PUT ABOUT 10 MILES UP AND 10 MILES DOWN ON THE CAR. IT REALLY FELT PRETTY GOOD. IT WAS A GOOD LITTLE CAR. YOU HAVE A LITTLE LEFT 6 UP HERE, AND THAT'S GONNA TIGHTEN INTO A 3, SO YOU'RE ON YOUR LEFT 6. NOW IT'S GONNA TIGHTEN TO A 3 AT THIS CORNER. FEEL LIKE A LEFT... - WHOA. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE END OF THAT ONE. - UH-OH. - YEP. IT KIND OF SOUNDED LIKE IT CLUNKED IN THE BACK. I DON'T KNOW. THAT AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. SO WE TOOK THE CAR OUT, DROVE IT UP THERE. IT DID BEAUTIFULLY. BRDDRAARDDA, POW, BLEW A BROKEN AXLE. CAR IS 100% USELESS. Hoyenga: BROKE IT SO BAD, IT SNAPPED TOTALLY OFF. DO WE HAVE AN S SHAFT COMING OR... - WRECKING CAR HAS THEM. - NO, WRECKING CAR'S GOT THEM. YEAH. Kaufman: IT'S COMMON IN RACING TO HAVE A BACKUP CAR, JUST FOR PARTS, NOT RACING. THINK OF IT AS A MOBILE PARTS BIN. SO I WENT AND BOUGHT A WRX WAGON THAT WAS... IT REALLY HAD ALL THE SPARES FOR OUR RACECAR AND WAS EASILY DEPLOYED. NICE AND A LITTLE MORE STOUT. YEAH. SO WE SNATCHED AN AXLE OUT OF MY LITTLE SUPPORT VEHICLE THAT I BROUGHT ALONG FOR JUST THAT REASON. IT'S A ROLLING PARTS BIN, AND TODAY IT CAME THROUGH IN A PINCH. I THINK THAT'S IT. AND SO WE STOLE AN AXLE OUT OF IT, PUT IT IN. OKAY. Kaufman: WE GOT THAT ABOUT PUT BACK TOGETHER. JUST ABOUT. I'M TRYING TO GET THE LOWER SKID PLATE BOLTS BACK IN. ALL RIGHT. THE AXLE SHAFT, 100% K.O.d. - REALLY? ALSO, I'VE GOT A MAJOR CONCERN ABOUT... THIS HOOD? ...ABOUT THE REST OF THEM CONSIDERING WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN TO THAT SHAFT. WELCOME TO RALLY. Man: HEY, OKAY. Kaufman: THE BIG QUESTION MARK IS WHETHER WE MANAGED TO FIX THE WELDS ON THE ROLL CAGE TO PASS INSPECTION. Man #2: WHO MODIFIED THE ROLL CAGE? Man #3: FRONT WHEEL IS A LITTLE MESSED UP. STRUT IS ALL PULLED APART. - IS HE SEEMING... - HE'S UPSET. Skucas: DO YOU NEED TO LOSE YOUR IN THE WOODS AND THEN COME BACK? Kaufman: SO WE'RE FINALLY HERE, SHELTON, WASHINGTON, HOME OF THE 2018 OLYMPUS RALLY. THIS ISN'T JUST SOME BACKYARD EVENT WITH A FEW CONES. THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING THE RALLY HERE EVER SINCE 1973, AND IT WAS EVEN A STOP ON THE WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP FOR A FEW YEARS IN THE '80s. THE SCENERY IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IS AWE-INSPIRING, BUT THE RACE ITSELF DEMANDS RESPECT. IT TAKES PLACE OVER 2 DAYS, OVER 199 TOTAL MILES, INCLUDING TRAVEL FROM STAGE TO STAGE, OVER GRAVEL ROADS, THROUGH EVERGREEN FORESTS. IT SOUNDS LOVELY, BUT IT'S PUNISHING. DAY ONE CONSISTS OF EIGHT TIMED STAGES WITH TWO SCHEDULED SERVICE STOPS FOR A TOTAL OF 136 MILES. DAY TWO IS FIVE STAGES LONG WITH A SINGLE SERVICE STOP FOR A TOTAL OF 62 MILES. THE TIMES ON ALL THE STAGES ARE ADDED UP, AND WHOEVER HAS THE FASTEST TIME AT THE END OF DAY TWO IS THE WINNER. SOME BIG NAMES HAVE STOOD ATOP THE PODIUM AT OLYMPUS. GUYS LIKE KEN BLOCK, TRAVIS PASTRANA, DAVID HIGGINS. MY GOAL IS TO DO THE SAME, AT LEAST IN MY CLASS OF NORMALLY ASPIRATED FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE, BUT THE FIRST THING ON THE AGENDA, RECCE. NOW THAT KRISTA HAS JOINED ME, WE HAVE 12 HOURS TO REVIEW THE DETAILED COURSE NOTES WE CREATED. WE'RE USING A TRUCK BECAUSE THE RACECAR IS HEADED OFF FOR ITS SAFETY INSPECTION. RIGHT 3 TIGHTENS TO A 2 OVER BRIDGE. AND A LITTLE LOOSE RIGHT HERE THIS IS, LIKE, SIDEWAYS INTO THE DOOR. - YOU WANT ME TO SAY... - SHUTDOWN, SHUTDOWN, SHUTDOWN. SHUTDOWN? OKAY. WHENEVER I HEAR SHUTDOWN, THAT MEANS BRING IT DOWN TO A CRAWL. I'LL SACRIFICE WHATEVER TIME WE HAVE TO TO NOT WRECK THAT CORNER. - OH, YEAH. KRISTA AND I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, BECOMING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER'S COMMUNICATION STYLES USING COMMON RALLY VOCABULARY. RIGHT 6 INTO LEFT 2. WE RATE EACH CORNER FROM 1 TO 6 BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF EACH CORNER. THE LOWER THE NUMBER, THE TIGHTER THE CORNER. THROUGH TO THE FINISH, AND THEN... A HUNDRED AND WHATEVER... ...DEAD AHEAD TO SHUT HER DOWN. KRISTA AND I HAVE A LOT OF MILES OF RECCE TO GET THROUGH IN A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. YEAH, SO THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THE CAR THROUGH TECH WITHOUT US, YEAH? - YEAH. - OKAY. SO WHILE I'M OUT HERE, I LEFT THE GUYS IN CHARGE OF TAKING THE SUBARU THROUGH TECH INSPECTION, AND WE'LL FINALLY GET AN ANSWER ON WHETHER OR NOT OUR ROLL CAGE IS SAFE AND APPROVED FOR RACE USE. - NO, THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE. - IS THERE? Bowman: SO RALLY RACING IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF YOU'LL CRASH BUT WHEN. SO TECH INSPECTION IS A WAY TO MAKE SURE ALL THE COMPETITORS ARE EQUIPPED IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE RISKS. - WE JUST GOT IT. - JUST ON THE DASH. OUR BIG QUESTION MARK IN ALL THIS... ...IS WHETHER WE MANAGED TO FIX THE WELDS ON OUR ROLL CAGE TO A HIGH ENOUGH SAFETY STANDARD TO PASS AFTER INITIALLY NOT WELDING THE JOINTS ALL THE WAY AROUND. NO. NO, THIS... NO. WE BUILT IT A WEEK AGO. - YEAH. - WE FINISHED IT A WEEK AGO. THAT'S KIND OF HOW IT WORKS. THANK YOU. Mansour: SO ALL OF OUR HARD WORK PAID OFF. WE PASSED, FLYING COLORS, AND THAT'S A MASSIVE RELIEF, AND SO NOW WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT TO WHERE WE JUST GOT TO GO GET REGISTERED, AND WE GO RACE. SO AARON AND KRISTA HAVE ABOUT SIX MORE HOURS OF RECCE TODAY, SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THE SUBARU IS ALL GASSED UP AND READY FOR THEIR FIRST STAGE BRIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. Skucas: PARC EXPOSé IS ALWAYS A GREAT TIME FOR FANS TO COME OUT AND SEE THE CARS AND MEET THE DRIVERS, EVEN SIT IN THE CARS. - AARON KAUFMAN! - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS? - I SAW YOU ON TV. - YEAH? - HEY. - HI. HEY, HEY! Skucas: IT'S 15 MINUTES BEFORE FIRST CAR OUT, AND THAT'S THE ULTIMATE HURRY UP AND WAIT WHERE YOU CAN JUST LET ALL THOSE FEELINGS JUST FESTER AND MAKE YOU NERVOUS. Kaufman: GOOD MORNING, BUCKY. YOU READY TO START THE RACE, HEAD INTO A GROOVE THERE, BUDDY? YEP, I'M HOPING TO. YOU KNOW, AS A LIFELONG PROFESSIONAL, AMAZING SKATEBOARDER, YOU KNOW, WINS EVERYTHING THERE IS, EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN, BUCKY LASEK IS ALSO A COMPETITIVE-CAR GUY, AND HE HAS DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND A LOT TO BRING TO THE TABLE, AND I FEEL LIKE A BETTER-ENRICHED HUMAN FOR KNOWING THE GENTLEMAN. MAN, I'M REALLY EXCITED. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. DUDE, YOU'RE GONNA BE SO STOKED, DUDE. - OH, I KNOW. - YOU'RE GONNA BE SO STOKED. HOW DID YOU FEEL AFTER YOUR FIRST ONE? I DON'T THINK I BREATHED THROUGH THE WHOLE FIRST STAGE. YEAH, YEAH. I'M EXCITED TO BE HERE, BUT THERE'S ALSO A TENSION, A NERVOUSNESS, YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE LIVES ARE ON THE LINE, AND WHILE ALL RACING IS DANGEROUS, SOMETIMES IT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHERS. - T-MINUS, WHAT, 20 MINUTES? - SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I FIGURE I'M SUCH A HACK AT BEING WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ON TIME, SO I FIGURED I'D JUST STAND BY THE CAR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU... - THANKS. - ...FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE IN THE CAR AND OUT OF THE CAR AND GETTING THIS THING HERE. IT'S HUGE TO ME. IT'S HUGE. WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BLAME FOR THAT, SO IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S PRETTY EXCITING. YEAH. WE GOT TO START MOVING UP IN JUST A COUPLE MINUTES. BECAUSE WE'RE BEHIND KRISTEN, SO... YEAH. IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME. - LET'S ROCK 'N' ROLL. - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. - HAVE FUN. - SEE YOU OUT THERE, GUYS. - GOOD LUCK, MAN. - THANK YOU. - SEE YOU. - SURE. Kaufman: I'M PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON MYSELF, WHICH IS MAKING ME A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE ENOUGH RACES, I'VE DONE ENOUGH STUFF, THAT I REALLY SHOULD BE MOVING UP IN THE PACK. I REALLY SHOULD BE PROGRESSING. I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO LEAN ON AND PUSH A LITTLE MORE... ...BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE, THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES HERE. IS IT UNLIKELY THAT WE GET DEAD OR INJURED? YEAH, IT'S PRETTY UNLIKELY, BUT THAT POSSIBILITY IS THERE. COULD WE LOSE THE CAR? YEAH, COMPLETELY. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE ALL SORTS OF THINGS COULD HAPPEN. IS IT POSSIBLE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE COULD HAVE MY FIRST DAY OF RALLY BEHIND US WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL TIME AND BE ON TOP? THAT'S POSSIBLE, TOO, I SUPPOSE. KRISTA, I'M VERY EXCITED. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE FUN. THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT. THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS, WE'VE GONE FROM JUST HAVING AN INTEREST IN RALLY TO MY FIRST RALLY PERIOD AT THE END. WE MADE IT. - OH, MY GOD. AND SO I'M GONNA TRY AND RUN AS FAST AS I FEEL SAFE DOING, AND WHATEVER COMES OUT THE OTHER SIDE IS WHATEVER COMES OUT THE OTHER SIDE. ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GET GEARED UP. YES, SIR. THIS WILL SET THE PACE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW, AND IT MAY BE FAST. IT MAY BE SLOW, AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. Woman: HERE YOU GO. GOOD LUCK TO YOU. Skucas: THANK YOU. DAYTON, 8.8 MILES. Kaufman: SO STAGE ONE IS DAYTON, 9 MILES OF LOOSE-GRAVEL ROAD THAT CLIMBS THROUGH THE FOREST TO A HIGH RIDGELINE AND BACK DOWN AGAIN. SO THIS STAGE, JUST EASE INTO IT, AND YOU'LL PICK UP SPEED AS WE GO. YEAH. CAR HANDLES DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST TIME I DROVE IT, SO... OH, YEAH, AND THIS SURFACE IS FUNKY. WAITING. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO. 20, CREST INTO LEFT 4 AND LEFT 3 INTO A RIGHT 4 SHORT AND RIGHT 4 OPEN AND LEFT 5 SHORT. THE VERY FIRST STAGE, YOU KNOW, THE EXCITEMENT WAS HIGH. I KNEW TO TAKE IT EASY. THAT UP THERE IS A LEFT 5 INTO LEFT 4, TIGHTENS TO A 3. TOP OUT. LEFT 3 LONG, OPEN, 40. SUPER SWEET, SUPER CLEAN, QUICK, NOT FAST. ACROSS THE RIDGE AND STAY LEFT 4, LONG. THERE'S A LEFT 4 LONG, AND IT OPENS, AND A RIGHT 4 THROUGH YELLOW AND THEN TURN LEFT 4 DEEP GRAVEL, LEFT 4. EBB INTO A RIGHT 3, THEN BRIDGE. CAUTION, RIGHT 3, THEN BRIDGE. UP 2, TURN LEFT 2, AND WE'LL STOP HERE WITH THESE FOLKS. WE GET TO THE END OF IT, HELL YEAH. HI, GUYS. Man #3: FRONT WHEEL IS A LITTLE MESSED UP. Kaufman: GUY AT THE FINISH GOES, "YOUR WHEEL IS ALL TILTED IN." I'D SAY IT HAPPENED ABOUT HALFWAY. DO YOU WANT TO OPEN THE HOOD AND WE CAN SEE? IS IT... DO YOU THINK IT'S BLOWN THROUGH HERE? YEAH. SURE ENOUGH, STRUT'S ALL, YOU KNOW, PULLED APART. IS IT GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CREW TO FIX IT OVERNIGHT? DAMN IT. THAT'S ONE, FIVE, ONE, LOOKING FOR HOME BASE. Bowman: THIS IS HOME BASE. GO AHEAD. OH, SERIOUS. IS THERE ENOUGH THREADS TO STUFF A NUT BACK ON THAT THING? IT'S STAGE ONE, AND THE TOP HAT ACTUALLY CAME LOOSE ON THE STRUT. THAT WAS A HUGE, HUGE BUMMER. Bowman: SO THE SHAFT IS STILL THERE? IT'S NOT BROKE OFF THE TOP? THAT'S GONE. WE'RE DNF FOR THE DAY BECAUSE IT HAS TO COME BACK TO CAR PARK RIGHT NOW. IT CAN'T CONTINUE ON AND COME IN AT SCHEDULED SERVICE, BUT AS LONG AS WE GET IT FIXED TODAY AND ACCEPT SOME HEAVY PENALTIES, RALLY RULES ALLOW US TO RE-ENTER TOMORROW AND FINISH THE RACE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE AT? EXIT OF DAYTON, OKAY, COOL. WE'LL SEE YOU IN A MINUTE. EXIT OF DAYTON, LET'S GO GET HIM. - BALL JOINTS STILL GOOD? - HE SAID IT'S DRIVABLE. HE CAN DRIVE IT BACK HERE, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO RISK RUINING THE CAR. I CONCUR, YEAH. DOES HE SEEM IN... - HE'S UPSET. YEAH. Kaufman: OH, THE DAMPER HAS BLOWN UP. NO. OH, THAT SUCKS. I WAS SO AGGRAVATED. I MEAN, JUST NOT MAD AT ANYONE, JUST AGGRAVATED. MAN, I'M TRYING REAL HARD TO NOT LOSE MY RIGHT NOW. DO YOU NEED TO LOSE YOUR IN THE WOODS AND THEN COME BACK? NO. NO. LIKE, YOU WERE DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. AH! WE GOT RED FLAGS. OKAY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED. WE JUST KNOW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CARS THAT ARE MISSING, AND WE ALL SIGNED ON KNOWING WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN, AND CRASHING IS ONE OF THOSE RISKS. - MAKE A HOLE! - MAKE A HOLE! - HEY! - MAKE A HOLE! - IT'S THAT WAY! - MAKE A HOLE! Kaufman: SO ON THE VERY FIRST STAGE OF THE OLYMPUS RALLY, WE EXPERIENCED SOME MECHANICAL FAILURE. THE CENTER NUT ON THE TOP OF MY FRONT STRUT, THAT ONE NUT, IT JUST BACKED OFF, AND THE STRUT FELL DOWN, AND WHEN IT DID, WHEN THE SUSPENSION DROOPED OUT, UNLOADED, THE SUSPENSION CAME AND JUST POPPED IN, BLEW UP INTO THE STRUT TOWER. REALLY SUCKS, I MEAN, OUR FIRST RALLY. THIS IS A STUPID-ASS PIECE OF... PART TO FAIL. Kaufman: RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO DAMAGE TO THE CAR WHATSOEVER, EXCEPT FOR THE STRUT FELL APART. SO AFTER GOING THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF SWAPPING OUT THE STRUTS AT NAMELESS... - LOOK AT THAT. - ...WE HAD A SILLY FAILURE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CHECK HOW TIGHT A NUT WAS. WE DIDN'T MARK IT. WE DIDN'T GO THROUGH IT. WE JUST MADE A MISTAKE. "THIS IS RALLY." IT'S LIKE, "." THAT'S AN OLD SAYING. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE THIS TIME. IT'S TRUE NEXT TIME. SO WHAT'S THE PLAN? Skucas: WE'RE BASICALLY GOING TO GET ASSIGNED STAGE TIMES FOR ALL OF TODAY. TOMORROW IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY OFFICIALLY RE-ENTER. BY RULES, WE ARE DNF FOR TODAY. WE CAN START COUNTING FOR STAGE TIMES AGAIN TOMORROW, BUT THEY ARE ALLOWING US TO GO BACK OUT, ENJOY THE REST OF THE STAGES FOR TODAY. WE'RE STILL RACING. WE'RE STILL IN IT, AND SO MUCH CAN STILL HAPPEN TO ANYBODY. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE ON ABOUT A 30-, 35-MINUTE TIME LINE FOR OUR EXPECTED OUT TIME, 30 MINUTES OF REST. GIVE IT A SHOT. Bowman: THEY SAID IF WE GET IT FIXED, THEN WE CAN GET BACK OUT AND PRACTICE, BY 1:15. Kaufman: THOUGH I'M DONE FOR THE DAY, IF I WANT TO GET OUT AND PRACTICE, I HAVE TO HAVE THIS CAR FIXED AND IN RALLY SHAPE BY THE START OF THE NEXT STAGE, AND THAT'S COMING UP IN JUST ONE HALF-HOUR. - I GOT IT. - GOOD. IT'S OUT. IT'S OUT. Skucas: HOW IS THIS REPAIR SITUATION LOOKING? I WAS TRYING TO GET AN ETA ON THIS? - I DON'T HAVE ONE YET. - FAIR? Kaufman: SO WE WERE ORIGINALLY HOPING WE COULD FILE THE TOP OF THE STUD UP AND CUT SOME THREADS BACK ON IT, BUT ONCE I DUG INTO IT, I REALIZED THERE ARE NO THREADS ON THE TOP OF IT. IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. I TRIED RUNNING A LUG NUT DOWN THE TOP OF IT. IT WASN'T GONNA WORK. IT'LL TEAR THAT OFF ON A BIG UNLOAD. - MM-HMM. - YEAH. THERE'S NO ENGAGEMENT. SO WE HAD TO, INSTEAD, OPT FOR A SAFER BUT MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION. WE TIGHTEN THE WHOLE THING UP AND THEN WELD THE TOP OF IT, THAT BITCH IS ON. - HELL YEAH. WE'RE JUST GONNA REASSEMBLE THE STRUT AND WELD THE TOP NUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T COME APART AGAIN. NOW WE JUST GOT TO GET IT MOUNTED BACK ON THE CAR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WHAT ARE WE AT ON TIME? Webster: WE'VE ONLY GOT 10 MINUTES. THE REASON WE'RE IN SUCH A HURRY TO GET THIS CAR FIXED AND OUT ON THE COURSE IS THREEFOLD. ONE, WITH THE PROBLEMS WE'VE FACED, I DIDN'T GET THE SEAT TIME I WAS HOPING FOR. Skucas: ALL RIGHT, GUYS. WE HAVE 7 MINUTES. YEAH. WE'RE GETTING THERE. TWO, IT'S ALSO MY LAST CHANCE TO CALM MY NERVES AND GET INTO A RHYTHM WITH KRISTA. ABOUT 4 MINUTES. AND FINALLY, WE CAN WORK OUT ANY LAST-MINUTE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR THAT STILL MAY BE LURKING... WE'RE GONNA MAKE A MOVE IN ABOUT A MINUTE. ...WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE INCREDIBLY BENEFICIAL TO OUR PERFORMANCE IN THE FINAL FIVE STAGES TOMORROW. YOU CAN GO FORWARD AND THEN RIGHT AND THEN LEFT. ARE YOU ALL BUCKLED AND HOOKED? AFTER WE GOT THE STRUT PUT BACK TOGETHER AND GOT THAT FIXED, WE WENT OUT. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE DNF FOR THE DAY, BUT WE'RE JUST RUNNING TO GET SEAT TIME, JUST TO PICK UP MILES. GO. 20, CREST INTO LEFT 4. SO WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE, I ACCRUED 52 MINUTES OF PENALTY TIME FOR MISSING SEVEN OF THE EIGHT STAGES TODAY, AND THAT'S A HUGE DEFICIT TO OVERCOME. LEFT 4 SHORT, ACROSS RIDGE. AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW, MY CHANCES OF BEING ON THAT PODIUM TOMORROW AREN'T LOOKING VERY GOOD. LEFT 4 INTO RIGHT 4, 30... BUT THERE'S ONE UNDERLYING THEME IN RALLY RACING -- NEVER GIVE UP. ...TIGHTENS TO A 3 HERE. SO COME SUNUP TOMORROW, IT'S GAME ON. Skucas: START THINKING ABOUT MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A MOVE HERE. I'M READY. IT'S RACE DAY 2, WHICH, FOR ME, IS A MUCH-NEEDED FRESH START. IT'S BEEN STRESSFUL. I'VE BEEN UPSET, BUT I'M GOING TO TRY NOT TO BRING ANY OF THAT, ANY OF THE ISSUES I HAD YESTERDAY INTO TODAY, ANY OF THAT MIND-SET. EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN TAUGHT, EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED, I'M GONNA TRY AND PRODUCE THE BEST JUICE THAT I CAN. JUST REMEMBER -- LOOSE IS FAST, BUT ON THE EDGE IS OUT OF CONTROL. - YEAH. - YOU GOT THIS, BUDDY. - YEAH. - COME ON. AND I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WITH A DIFFICULT DAY YESTERDAY. IN FACT, SO MANY CARS HAVE EITHER CRASHED OR BROKEN DOWN THAT NOW THERE'S ONLY THREE CARS LEFT COMPETING IN MY CLASS, WHICH MEANS THAT IF I MANAGE TO COMPLETE ALL FIVE RACE STAGES TODAY, I'LL BE ON THE PODIUM AT THE END OF MY VERY FIRST RALLY RACE. BUT AS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY YESTERDAY, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FINISH ONE STAGE, LET ALONE FIVE. IT'S 45 THROUGH HERE. WHY ARE THEY SLOWING US DOWN SO MUCH? TURN IN HERE. OH, THIS IS A RED CROSS STAGE. - OH - THEY RED CROSSED IT? - YEAH. - WHAT'S GOING ON? THIS STAGE HAS GOT RED FLAGGED. OKAY. WE'RE BASICALLY JUST CHILLING HERE, LEAVE ROOM FOR... - MEDICAL, YEAH. ...THE CREW TO GET HERE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED. OKAY. NO, I UNDERSTAND. Skucas: THIS STAGE, IT'S BEEN RED CROSSED, SO WE'RE HOLDING HERE, LEAVING GAPS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES, WAITING FOR NEXT INSTRUCTIONS. - MAKE A HOLE! - MAKE A HOLE! - MAKE A HOLE! - IT'S THAT WAY! - MAKE A HOLE! - MAKE A HOLE! Skucas: RIGHT NOW, WE'RE UNSURE WHO IT IS, BUT DEFINITELY AMBULANCES ARE INVOLVED, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A SIMPLE FIRE. WE JUST KNOW A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CARS THAT ARE MISSING, AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS UP THERE, SO IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO SEE, YOU KNOW? THERE'S A LOT OF RISKS INVOLVED IN THAT. WE ALL SIGNED ON KNOWING WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN, AND CRASHING IS ONE OF THOSE RISKS. LEFT 3 INTO RIGHT 4 INTO LEFT 4. I STARTED CALLING THE NOTES A LITTLE BIT FASTER JUST TO SEE IF HE WOULD DRIVE FASTER. FOUR 4 INTO LEFT 4 SHORT, 70. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! Skucas: LET'S SWING AROUND, GO TO THE NEXT STAGE. Kaufman: YEAH. SO YESTERDAY DUE TO A MECHANICAL FAILURE, WE DNF'd DAY 1 OF THE OLYMPUS RALLY. AFTER FIXING THE PROBLEM AND DOING SOME PRACTICE RUNS OUT ON THE COURSE, BOTH THE CAR AND I FEEL READY FOR DAY 2. HERE COMES THE AMBULANCE. BUT THE FIRST STAGE TODAY WAS RED CROSSED, MEANING SOMEONE HAD A NASTY OFF SOMEWHERE ON THE STAGE, AND IT'S NOT SAFE FOR US TO RUN. SO WE'RE MOVING ON TO THE SECOND STAGE OF THE DAY, COUGAR/WINDY. Skucas: THIS STAGE IS 10.2 MILES LONG, A COUPLE OF BRIDGES. IT'S A 10-MILE TREK DOWN A RUGGED, TWISTED, ULTRA-LOOSE GRAVEL ROAD THAT CAN GIVE A CAR A REAL BEATING. AND WE'RE IN. ARE YOU GOOD TO GO? - YEAH. - GOT IT. SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO. LEFT 4, 60. THAT'S A LEFT 5 SHORT, THEN 120 AFTER IT. AND PRESS INTO A RIGHT 5, NOW LEFT 4 INTO WOODS. Skucas: AARON WAS REALLY LISTENING TO THE NOTES. I COULD TELL, JUST BY THE WAY HE WAS DRIVING THE CAR. IT'S JUST ALL COMING TOGETHER. RIGHT 5, SHORT. AND AARON AND I ARE JUST IN A RHYTHM. HAIRPIN RIGHT... INTO A RIGHT 6, INTO A TURN. LEFT 6 ONTO THE ROAD PAST THE BRIDGE, RIGHT 4, LONG, PAST JUNCTION INTO A LEFT 5 PAST JUNCTION. WE GOT SOMETHING WRONG. DO WE HAVE A FLAT? VERY POSSIBLE. Kaufman: ON THE LAST MILE OF THE STAGE, I THOUGHT I HAD A BIG MECHANICAL PROBLEM. - YOU'RE ALMOST THERE. - I THOUGHT I HAD A FLAT. THEN I THOUGHT I HAD SOME BIGGER MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. THROUGH THE FINISH... WE WERE TAKING SOME HARD HITS. IT WAS ACTING REALLY WEIRD WHEN YOU GO AROUND CORNERS. DOES IT FEEL LIKE THE LEFT REAR IS FLAT? - YEAH. - OKAY. WE CAN ASK THEM TO LOOK, TOO. BEFORE I FELT COMFORTABLE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT STAGE, I WANTED THE GUYS WORKING THE FINISH TO GIVE IT A QUICK LOOK. CAN YOU LOOK AT OUR LEFT REAR? LOOKS FLAT, IT FEELS FLAT. HE SAYS GOOD. - HUH. MAYBE WE BLEW A STRUT OR SOMETHING. BUT WHEN THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING WAS SHIPSHAPE, I WAS BUMMED ABOUT THAT, JUST BUMMED THAT I DIDN'T PUSH HARDER. YOU WANT TO GET OUT AND LOOK AT IT? NO. LET'S GO WITH THIS PROCEED. WE'RE GOING RIGHT? YEAH, RIGHT. THERE'S A SAYING IN RALLY RACING, "PRESS ON REGARDLESS," AND IT'S SOMETHING I KEPT IN MY HEAD AS I ENTERED THE NEXT STAGE. THAT UP THERE IS A LEFT 3 INTO A RIGHT 4 INTO A LEFT 4. DUE TO THE NATURE OF RALLY RACING, YOU CAN'T JUST PULL OVER AND TAKE A PIT STOP WHENEVER YOU LIKE. THERE ARE DESIGNATED SERVICE STOPS. IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE NEXT SERVICE STOP ISN'T UNTIL AFTER THE END OF OUR NEXT STAGE, NAHWATZEL. SO I HAVE TO PRESS ON THROUGH THE NEXT 14 MILES REGARDLESS OF WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE WRONG WITH THE REAR END OF MY RALLY CAR. THEN RIGHT 2, AROUND THE BARREL. LEFT 2 THROUGH THE GATE. WE'RE TRYING. WE'RE TRYING. YEP, YEP. ONE 30, RIGHT 4, LONG, ACROSS THE FINISH, AND YOU CAN SHUT HER DOWN, AND WE JUST HAVE TO GET OUR TIME, PULL FORWARD, AND THEN WE CAN TAKE CAR OF THE CAR. YEAH. Bowman: THERE HE IS. THIS MORNING, WE'VE GOT THREE STAGES IN. IT APPEARS THAT THE CAR IS STILL TOGETHER, SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NORMAL SERVICE. WE'RE GONNA JACK IT UP, PULL THE WHEELS, TIRES OFF, JUST KIND OF DO A GENERAL NUT-AND-BOLT CHECK, FLUIDS CHECK. Skucas: GOT A LIST ON THE DASH WITH OUR OUT TIME. - YES, MA'AM. - 30 MINUTES. Bowman: WE'RE GOOD, FUEL CHECK, BOLT CHECK. ALL THE OIL IS GOOD. KIND OF LOOKED EVERYTHING OVER. THE TIRES ALL LOOK GOOD, WILLIS? - YEAH. - NO CHUNKS, NOTHING? Willis: IT FEELS REALLY GOOD WHEN YOU PUT THIS AMOUNT OF WORK INTO SOMETHING AND YOU END UP WITH A GOOD RESULT SO FAR. - 10 MINUTES. - AND IN IT GOES. - JUST UNDER 10 MINUTES, GUYS. - YES, BOSS. THAT'S THE RIGHT RESPONSE. WATCH YOUR ELBOWS, KNEES AND TOES. COMING BACK ON THE REAR. Willis: SO AS LONG AS WE CAN KEEP THIS PACE AND KEEP THIS RESULT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK WE'LL ALL BE PRETTY STOKED TONIGHT. Skucas: THANK YOU, GUYS. THERE'S OUR ARROW THERE TO TURN RIGHT. Kaufman: SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE ABOUT TO RUN STAGE 12, WHICH IS THE SECOND-TO-LAST STAGE OF THE DAY. NOW, IN AMERICAN RALLY, IT'S COMMON FOR MULTIPLE STAGES TO USE THE SAME COURSE. IN THIS CASE, I GET ANOTHER CRACK AT THE 10.2-MILE COUGAR/WINDY, AND I'M HOPING TO IMPROVE MY TIME OF 11 MINUTES AND 50 SECONDS. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, GO. 20, 4, THAT'S A LEFT 5, SHORT, THEN 120. LEFT 6, SHORT, THEN A LEFT 3 INTO A RIGHT 4 SHORT. MY SECOND-TO-LAST STAGE WAS... WE WERE SCREAMING. RIGHT 4. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHOA, WHOA. THIS IS A LEFT 4. BUT THE MOMENT YOU GET COMFORTABLE, THAT'S WHEN YOU MAKE MISTAKES. LEFT 5, HAIRPIN RIGHT. AND I KNEW THAT, SO IN THE END, I DECIDED TO BACK OFF JUST A LITTLE BIT. RIGHT 6 THAT LASTS FOR 200, BUMP, OVER CREST. - WE FINISHED. - COOL. WE BEAT OUR TIME BY 16 SECONDS. AND WE STILL MANAGED TO FINISH THAT STAGE 16 SECONDS FASTER THAN OUR LAST RUN. CLEAR MY AWAY. AND THAT GOT ME EXCITED FOR THE NEXT STAGE, NAHWATZEL, WHICH I HAD RUN EARLIER TODAY, A 14.1-MILE JAUNT THAT I MANAGED TO FINISH IN 16.51. BASED ON MY PERFORMANCE ON COUGAR/WINDY, I THINK I CAN BEAT MY TIME BY AT LEAST 20 SECONDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I NOTICED, AND I AM NOT A DRIVING INSTRUCTOR, SO I HESITATE EVEN SAYING THIS, SO TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT, WHATEVER YOU WANT. YEAH, GO. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. BUT I THINK THAT YOU COULD GO FASTER AND THEN GET ON THE BRAKES REALLY HARD. - YEAH. - BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ENGINE BRAKING A LOT... - YEP. ...INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY USING THE BRAKES TO THEIR FULLEST ABILITY. - 100%. I, YOU KNOW, WAS READING AARON TO SEE KIND OF WHERE HIS MENTAL SPACE WAS, AND I WAS LIKE, "IF YOU'RE GOOD, I'M GOOD. WE CAN GO FASTER." AND HE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT." GO, LEFT 3, 30, RIGHT 3, OPENS, CREST. 20, THEN ANOTHER RIGHT 3. Kaufman: ON THE LAST STAGE, I FINALLY FOUND MY RHYTHM, FINALLY GOT IN IT. A LEFT 3 HERE INTO RIGHT 4 INTO LEFT 4. AND IT WAS... WAS ON FIRE. THAT UP THERE IS A RIGHT 5 INTO A LEFT 3 OFF CAMBER. THEN I STARTED CALLING THE NOTES A LITTLE BIT FASTER, JUST TO SEE IF HE WOULD DRIVE FASTER. REPEAT RIGHT 5 INTO A LEFT 3 OFF CAMBER INTO RIGHT 4, OVER CREST. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. I REALLY HAD A GOOD TIME. RIGHT 4, SHORT, INTO LEFT 4, SHORT, 70. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! OH, GOSH. - WHAT HAPPENED? - HE'S STOPPED. Rodriguez: WE'RE TRACKING AARON IN THE LIVE AREA APP, AND APPARENTLY HE'S IN THIS FINAL STAGE, AND IT'S SHOWING UP AS HE'S STOPPED. Willis: DID HE ROLL THE CAR? IS IT A CAR FIRE? LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHY IS IT AT 0? NO ONE KNOWS. WE'RE ALL JUST THINKING THE ABSOLUTE WORST. Kaufman: AS YOU CAN TELL BY THIS POINT, THE OLYMPUS RALLY IS A HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE FOR EVERYONE, FROM THE FIRST-TIME RACER TO THE SEASONED VETERAN, AND THAT INCLUDES THE TOP-THREE OVERALL WINNERS THIS YEAR. FIRST PLACE, WITH A TIME OF 2 HOURS, 11 MINUTES AND 22 SECONDS, PATRIK SANDELL WITH PER ALMKVIST CO-DRIVING. SECOND, WITH A TIME OF 2:18:23 IS JEFF SEEHORN WITH KAREN JANKOWSKI CO-DRIVING, AND THIRD, WITH A TIME OF 2:21:20, IS SAM ALBERT AND HIS CO-DRIVER MICHELLE MILLER. TRULY IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCES ALL AROUND THAT INSPIRE ME TO KEEP PUSHING. 4 SHORT INTO LEFT 4 SHORT, 20. Kaufman: SO IN THE LAST LAST STAGE OF THE OLYMPUS RALLY, I HAD A REALLY GREAT STAGE THAT REALLY CAUSED ME TO REALLY HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE AND PUSH IT HARD, AND I PUSHED IT BEYOND MY TALENT THRESHOLD. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. OH, GOSH. I MADE A BONEHEAD MISTAKE. I KNEW IT BEFORE WE HAD ENTERED THE CORNER. THERE WAS NO STOPPING THE CAR. THERE WASN'T ENOUGH THROTTLE TO GET US OUT OF IT, AND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH TALENT TO PULL US OUT. - YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, I'M FINE. ARE YOU? YEP. THEY SAY GOD LOOKS OUT FOR CHILDREN AND FOOLS. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE I WAS TODAY. - WHAT HAPPENED? - HE'S STOPPED. Rodriguez: WE'RE TRACKING AARON IN THE LIVE AREA APP, AND APPARENTLY HE'S IN THIS FINAL STAGE, AND IT'S SHOWING UP AS HE'S STOPPED. WE'RE ALL JUST HANGING OUT, AND WE'RE, LIKE, WE'RE THINKING THE ABSOLUTE WORST. Willis: DID HE ROLL THE CAR? IS THE CAR ON FIRE? LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHY IS IT AT 0? NO ONE KNOWS. Skucas: PRESS ON REGARDLESS. WE GOT THIS, AARON. Kaufman: YEAH. - HE GOT PULLED OUT OF A DITCH. - OKAY. SO HE'S ON HIS WAY UNDER, AT... VERY SLOW. Skucas: ALL RIGHT. HOW'S YOUR STEERING? Kaufman: IT'S ALL THERE. Man #4: HE'S MOVING 15.4 MILES AN HOUR. - THAT'S PRETTY FAST. - HE'S KILLING IT. - FASTER THAN 0. - FASTER THAN 0. Willis: NO ONE IS IN FRONT OF HIM ON THE MAP, SO NO ONE IS TOWING HIM. HE'S UNDER HIS OWN POWER. Skucas: LEFT 5, THEN BRAKING. Bowman: IT'S GETTING CLOSER. IT'S COMING DOWN, COMING DOWN THE HILL. HOLDING STEADY AT 30. THE SPIRITS WENT FROM, LIKE, DOWN TO NOTHING TO, "THEY JUST MIGHT FINISH," YOU KNOW? AND ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS PASS THAT FINISH LINE. THE TIME, IT DOESN'T MATTER. THERE HE IS. Man #5: YEAH. THERE YOU GO, BUB. - WOO! - THERE YOU GO, BUB! Kaufman: WE WERE ABLE TO PUSH THE LITTLE CAR IN ACROSS THE FINISH, AND WHAT A GLORIOUS END. - HEY, WE DID IT. - YEAH. A STRANGE AND WELL-SORTED LITTLE TALE. - CONGRATULATIONS! - THANK YOU. - LOOK AT THAT WHEEL. - YEAH! JUST SEEING EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, WATCH US FINISH, THAT WAS A BIG DEAL. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AARON KAUFMAN IN THE HOUSE! 151, AARON! I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE WAS SO EXCITED, BUT THEY ARE. IT FEELS GOOD. - YOU BROUGHT HER HOME. - YEAH. GOOD JOB, MAN. HAVING ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS OF FAILED PARTS, WRECKED CARS, BROKEN GLASS, BLOOD... - ALL RIGHT! - GOOD AS NEW. ...WHILE I SAID I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY, I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE BLOOD AND BROKEN GLASS. I THINK WE WERE RUNNING AT, YOU KNOW, 50 SOMETHING AFTER WE BROKE IT. - I KNOW. I WAS LIKE, "THIS THING IS A TANK. IT'S GOING." YEAH. I'VE ENJOYED THE RALLY. I'M LOOKING TO COME BACK. I THINK THE CAR IS ON ITS WAY TO BECOMING QUITE A GREAT LITTLE RALLY CAR. OKAY, SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE OVER TO OUR FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE CLASSES. THIRD PLACE, IN NATIONAL NORMALLY ASPIRATED FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE, YOU ALL KNOW HIM AS THE BEARDED WONDER, IT'S AARON KAUFMAN WITH KRISTA SKUCAS AS CO-DRIVER. Kaufman: BY FINISHING MY FIRST RALLY THROUGH ALL OF THE ABUSE, I MANAGED TO SECURE A SPOT ON THE PODIUM IN MY CLASS. WHICH BOX? - THE SHORT ONE. ALL RIGHT! WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. I'M SITTING HERE TODAY, FINISHED THE RALLY, AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS THIRD OUT OF THREE FINISHERS, I LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON -- TO NEVER GIVE UP. WELL, AARON, IT'S A TOUGH, TOUGH SPORT, AS YOU NOW KNOW, BUT WOW. YOU KEPT AT IT. THE TEAM KEPT THE CAR GOING, AND HERE YOU ARE. YOU'RE ON THE PODIUM. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, THERE NEVER WAS ANY DECISION TO MAKE OTHER THAN KEEP GOING, JUST KEEP PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. THIS WAS SOMETHING WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO. IT WAS SOMETHING I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN. WE BOUGHT A CAR. WE LOOKED INTO IT. WE DECIDED TO COME, AND, YOU KNOW, WITH DAVE AT RALLY READY HAS JUST BEEN A DRIVING FORCE BEHIND EVERYTHING, HELPING US FIND KRISTA, AND I KNOW I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR KRISTA, IT WASN'T FOR DAVE AND MY TEAM AT ARCLIGHT, YOU KNOW, DILIGENTLY PUTTING TOGETHER A GOOD CAR. - ALL RIGHT. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON THIRD PLACE. MOVING ON OVER HERE... IT SEEMS SILLY TO BE SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE HERE. NO, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT IT'S SO MUCH FUN. ALL RIGHT. CHEERS, MY FRIEND. - OH, CHEERS. - CHEERS. CHEERS. YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE, IT'S SO MUCH WORK TO GET HERE. I'M SUCH A GOOFY EMOTIONAL PIECE OF CRAP. THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE, MAN. SUPER DUPER COOL, MAN. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IT WAS A LOT OF EFFORT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. DAVE HELPED ME UNDERSTAND HOW TO RACE THIS CAR, HOW TO RUN THE CAR. WHAT A GIFTED AND TALENTED AND CARING INDIVIDUAL, AND BUCKY WAS REALLY A BLESSING, YOU KNOW, TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THAT IN YOUR CORNER AND ROOTING FOR YOU AND TRYING TO HELP YOU GET FASTER. KRISTA WAS DEFINITELY A BIG, BIG PART OF THE FINISH TODAY. THIS IS SUCH A SPECIFIC SET OF SKILLS. I LEARNED A LOT FROM HER, AND SHE'S REALLY GOOD, AND SO, IS THIS THE DREAM TEAM? I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE PICKED, I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE HIRED, I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE SUGGESTED A BETTER GROUP OF PEOPLE. I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME, AND IT'S JUST A... ALL RIGHT. BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS. THANK YOU. - WE APPRECIATE IT. YEAH, IT WAS AWESOME. THANKS FOR HAVING US ON THE RIDE, MAN. - SURE, ABSOLUTELY. - YEAH. LET'S DO IT AGAIN SOON, HUH? - THANK YOU. YEAH, VERY SOON, AS SOON AS WE CAN. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN BUY A LOT OF THINGS, BUT YOU CAN'T BUY MEMORIES LIKE THIS. IT FEELS GOOD. IT MAKES ALL THE HARD WORK WORTH IT. I THINK THAT'S IT. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
