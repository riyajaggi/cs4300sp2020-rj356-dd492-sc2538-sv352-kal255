 I'VE BEEN BUILDING CARS FOR OTHER PEOPLE FOR FAR TOO LONG. NOW I'M TAKING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. AT MY NEW SHOP, ARCLIGHT FABRICATION, I'M DESIGNING AFTERMARKET TRUCK PARTS, BUILDING UNIQUE VEHICLES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD, AND I'M HAVING MORE FUN DOING IT. I'VE HANDPICKED A TEAM OF THE BEST BUILDERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN ME. BUILDING THESE CUSTOM VEHICLES WILL CHALLENGE OUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE ON EVERY LEVEL. AND WHEN THEY'RE DONE, WE'LL PUT EACH ONE TO THE TEST.

 I'M AARON KAUFMAN, AND THIS IS "SHIFTING GEARS." TONIGHT... WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE EXHAUST. WE'RE GONNA TAKE AN OVER-THE-ROAD WORK TRUCK AND TURN IT INTO A RACE CAR, AND PUT IT UP AGAINST OTHER PROFESSIONAL RACERS IN COLORADO SPRINGS, AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT ABOUT AS FAST AS WE CAN. TWO WEEKS. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. WE PUT THE SIDEPODS ON IT, YOU MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A NORMAL TRUCK. THERE IT IS. AND HIGH PROBABILITY OF WRECKING THE VEHICLE...

 WE NEED A VERY STRONG CAGE. BUT BUILDS DON'T ALWAYS GO ACCORDING TO PLAN. THIS IS GONNA BE A DISASTER. WE'VE PACKED EVERYTHING TOGETHER, SLAMMED EVERYTHING IN THERE, AND WE'RE GONNA PUT IT ON TRACK AND SEE HOW IT HANGS WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS' TRUCKS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. OUTRIGHT BATTLE ROYALE, I THINK. JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S BACK TOGETHER. JUST BASICALLY GONNA DO A START-UP. SO, WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF TURNING A SEMI-TRUCK INTO A RACE CAR, THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT UP AGAINST THIS COUNTRY'S BEST SEMI DRIVERS AT PIKES PEAK INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY. AND IT ALL BEGAN JUST ONE WEEK AGO. YOU SAID FIND YOU A TRUCK, I FOUND YOU ONE THE NEXT DAY. I THINK SHE'S JUST PERFECT. GOT A 60 SERIES DETROIT IN IT. I'LL LEFT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PERFECT OR NOT. SO, WHEN I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BUILD A SEMI RACE CAR. I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND MUCH MONEY, AND I WANTED A DETROIT SERIES 60 MOTOR IN IT. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT MOTOR RIGHT THERE, MAN. SEMI-TRUCK RACING HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE MID-'70s, AND IT HAS A WORLDWIDE FOLLOWING. COMPETITORS RANGE ACROSS THE BOARD FROM PROFESSIONAL RACE-CAR DRIVERS TO YOUR AVERAGE JOES. THE RULES FOR BUILDING ARE PRETTY SIMPLE. THE TRUCKS MUST BE MASS-PRODUCED MODELS THAT ARE HIGHLY MODIFIED FOR SPEED AND SAFETY. SO WHEN WE GO TO THE PIKES PEAK INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY, WE'LL BE ENTERING FOUR DISTINCT COMPETITIONS. ONE -- A DRAG RACE. TWO -- AN OVAL RACE. THREE -- A ROAD RACE. AND THEY JUST ADDED A FREESTYLE COMPETITION. SO WITH ONLY THREE WEEKS UNTIL RACE DAY, WE GOT RIGHT TO WORK. THE LIGHTER IT IS, THE FASTER IT IS, SO THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WAS TO STRIP OFF ALL THE UNNECESSARY EQUIPMENT. TO MEET MY GOALS, WE NEEDED TO SQUEEZE AS MUCH POWER AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THE SERIES 60 MOTOR IN A SHORT TIME FRAME. ENTER BOB BALL. HE LIVES! HE'S ONE OF THE TOP DIESEL- ENGINE BUILDERS IN THE COUNTRY. LOOKS LIKE A GOOD START. HOW MUCH POWER ARE WE GONNA MAKE OUT OF THIS BIG TRACTOR? OH, IT'LL BE AN EASY 850. WE'RE REALLY AFTER FOUR NUMBERS, HERE. WE CAN PROBABLY GET IT THERE. OVER THE PAST WEEK, HE'S HELPED US UPGRADE THE TURBO... THE INJECTORS, AND THE MANIFOLD, WHICH BRINGS US TODAY WHERE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE SEE IF WE CAN FIRE UP THE ENGINE. SAY A PRAYER. LET'S SEE IF SHE'LL LIGHT. ANYBODY THAT NEEDS TO DRY THEIR HAIR, STAND ABOUT HERE. THAT TURBO WILL DRIVE YOUR HAIR IN A HURRY. IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO LOSE SOME JEWELRY, PUT YOUR FINGERS ANYWHERE AROUND THE FRONT OF THAT INLET, TOO. EVERYBODY CLEAR? CLEAR ENOUGH. COME ON. LET ME DISCONNECT POWER. THERE'S A PLUG BACK HERE, IN THE BACK OF THE OIL-FILTER HOUSING. - YEAH. - IT'S NOT TIGHT... ALLEN PLUG. WHAT DO YOU GOT GOING ON -- IN YOUR SKEET PORT? YEAH, IT'S SKEETIN' OVER HERE, SKEETIN' A LITTLE OIL. SINCE THE FUEL SYSTEM WASN'T IN PLACE YET, WE JUST USED FUEL OUT OF ONE THE BARRELS. WE'RE NOT MAKING PRESSURE. AND WE WERE JUST HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO DRAW FUEL THAT HIGH, AND WE WERE REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME BLEEDING THE AIR OUT OF THE PUMP. MY GoPro GOT DOUSED. HI. SO, IF WE'RE GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE IN COLORADO SPRINGS, WE'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO NEED A LOT OF HORSEPOWER. SO, WE'RE SWAPPING OUT ALL THE FUEL LINES, 'CAUSE NOT ONLY IS THERE FUEL LEAKING OUT... ALL RIGHT. BUT AIR IS BEING DRAWN INTO THE FUEL SYSTEM, CAUSING ISSUES. LET'S SEE IF THIS WORKS. IT WORKS IN MY HEAD MOVIES. HOPEFULLY THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM. WHAT A PAIN IN THE REAR. 'CAUSE IF IT'S NOT THE FUEL LINE, WE'VE GOT A MYSTERY TO SOLVE, AND WE'RE SHORT ON TIME AS IT IS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HIT IT? GIVE 'ER A RIP. BURNING A LOT CLEANER. IT'S ALIVE! ONCE WE GOT THE AIR OUT OF THE SYSTEM, IT RAN FINE. WE WERE ABLE TO RUN IT OUT OF A BARREL. BOB, THAT'S EXCELLENT. SO, WE GOT THIS THING SAWED DOWN, WE GOT THE REAR SUSPENSION SWAPPED, WE GOT IT BACK CARRYING WEIGHT ON THE FRONT... NEW CLUTCH, NEW TRANSMISSION... RIGHT GEARS... DRIVE SHAFT IS IN... I'D SAY YOU KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK. WE JUST GOT TO FINISH RACE-CAR CONVERSION. I'LL GET A NOSE BACK ON IT, GET STICKS INSIDE OF IT... MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A TRUCK AGAIN. WITH ANYONE ELSE'S HELP, THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. BOB BALLS WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE 900 HORSEPOWER SOMEWHERE IN THE BALL PARK OF 2,200-FOOT POUNDS OF TORQUE. THE REST OF THIS IS STUFF WE DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT. SO YOU GOT THE BIG TRUCK I THINK WRANGLED UP PRETTY GOOD FOR US. THAT'S WHAT WE DO. ALMOST A RACE CAR. IT WAS A PLEASURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YES. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE LAST WE'RE GOING TO SEE OF BOB. HE'S INVITED ME UP TO SEE HIS INCREDIBLE SHOP IN A FEW DAYS. THAT'S AN OFFER I CAN'T REFUSE. HOW ABOUT YOU JUST STAY? THERE'S PLENTY OF DIESELS AROUND HERE. IT WOULD BE A LONG DISCUSSION WITH MAMA. YEAH. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE, YA FILTHY ANIMAL! NOW, BEFORE WE CAN GO RACE IN COLORADO, WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ALTERATIONS TO THE TRUCK'S CHASSIS. WHAT ARE YOU MEASURING? TRYING TO DECIDE ON WHAT THE SHAPE OF THE BODYWORK'S GONNA LOOK LIKE. SO, THE TRUCK IS VERY MINIMAL BY THE FACT THAT IT JUST HAS ONE JOB, AND IT'S TO PULL TRAILERS. SO EVERYTHING THAT YOU SEE DOWN THE SIDE OF IT IS BATTERY LOCATION, LARGELY FUEL TANKS, AND FACADE JUST TO COMPLETE THE APPEARANCE OF THE TRUCK. SINCE WE'VE REMOVED ALL THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T NEED, WE HAVE TO ADD BACK A PORTION OF THE TRUCK BETWEEN THE CAB AND THE REAR AXLE. SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS, DO A BOX DOWN THE WHOLE SIDE. YOU SEE HOW THE FENDER COMES DOWN? LIKE, IF WE CONTINUED THAT -- THEN THE TRUCK HAS A SHAPE -- YOU KNOW, DOWN THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK. BECAUSE THE FRAME RAIL IS NOT EVEN HALF THE WIDTH OF THE OVERALL CAB. IF WE HIT A POLE, A WALL, ANOTHER TRUCK, WE HAVE TO TRY AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF INTRUSION THAT THE OTHER VEHICLE OR POLE OR WALL CAN MAKE INTO THE CAB. SO, WE PUT THE SIDEPODS ON IT. A. -- TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A NORMAL TRUCK. B. -- TO PROTECT EVERYTHING INSIDE, INCLUDING THE OCCUPANT. AND THEN THE LAST THING IS TO KEEP THE OTHER TRUCKS FROM GETTING INSIDE THE CAB AND THE BACK TIRES, THINGS LIKE THAT. THIS ONE -- THIS ONE'S THE ONE. SO IT'LL HAVE OUTRIGGERS THAT RUN FROM THE FRAME TO THIS. AND THEN ANOTHER ONE WILL RUN UP LIKE THAT. ACROSS THE TOP WILL BE SHEETED ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE FRAME RAIL, AND SO WE'LL JUST -- THE PODS WILL BE ENCASED. SOMETHING THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A TRUCK INCREASES THE SAFETY FOR THE DRIVER I THINK PROPORTIONALLY. THERE IT IS. THAT SIDE IS JUST A SLIGHT BIT LOWER. I THINK IT'S LEANING THAT WAY. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAR OFF, THOUGH. DUDE, IT'S LITERALLY A 1/16TH DIFFERENCE. OH. SO... I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IS THE FLOOR ONLY NOT LEVEL HERE? YEAH, I THINK SO. SO, IS THAT LEVEL? THE ONE SIDE IS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE OTHER. IT'S JUST -- IT'S LOW BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE FLOOR. I MEAN, IT'S FINE. THIS SIDE'S SLIGHTLY KICKED DOWN, RIGHT? - MM-HMM. - YEAH, WELL... THERE'S NOT ENOUGH VARIANCE FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO... TWO AMATEURS WORKED ON THIS SIDE, RIGHT? SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. HEY, BOWMAN...? ARE YOU A CHEF? NO. THIS IS OUR NEW ARCLIGHT FABRICATIONWEAR. TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE EXHAUST. SO, SINCE OUR ENGINE'S PRODUCING 1,000 HORSEPOWER AND WE HAVE THAT BIG TURBO, WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT OF AIRFLOW. THIS TUBING IS OUR EXHAUST. MAGNAFLOW SENT A COUPLE OF KITS. OBVIOUSLY MAGNAFLOW DOESN'T MAKE A KIT FOR A SEMI-TRUCK, SO I'VE GOT TO CUT AND MAKE IT HOW I WANT IT. ROGER. ROGER, ROGER. OVER, OVER. THIS IS THE START OF OUR DOWNPIPE. SO, THE TURBO'S GONNA SIT HERE, DOWNPIPE, AND THEN WE'LL DUMP UNDER THE FRAME AND RUN STRAIGHT BACK, AND THEN OUT, EVENTUALLY. I CUT MORE. SO, I HAVE ALL THESE PIECES AND I HAVE TO MAKE ALL THESE PIECES WORK WITH HOW I WANT IT TO HAPPEN. ARE YOU CREEPIN' DOWN LOW? OR ARE YOU STAYING HIGH? - WITH THE EXHAUST? - YEAH. IT'S GONNA COME -- WELL, IT'LL BE BELOW THE FRAME RAIL. IT'S GONNA COME RIGHT BETWEEN THERE AND HERE. AND THEN I'M GONNA DO TWO COMING OUT THE SIDES RIGHT HERE. - MM. I LIKES. - MM-HMM. SO IT'LL BE PRETTY COOL. WE COULD DO A BACK ROLL, SO IT WOULD MAKE, LIKE, A LITTLE TIP... YOU KNOW, WITH -- ON TOP OF YOUR STUFF. HEY, BRO... HEY, TWO WEEKS. WE GOT TWO WEEKS. REMEMBER WHAT ALL THE COOL, SUPER ELABORATE IDEAS DID FOR US? YEAH. AND IT LOOKS COOL AND ELABORATE. TWO WEEKS. SO? WE FINISHED THAT IN TWO WEEKS. 100 DAYS. RACING IS A VERY ON-THE-EDGE KIND OF THING. A HIGH-PROBABILITY OF WRECKING THE VEHICLE. WE NEED A VERY STRONG CAGE. MADE IT! I CAME HERE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ENGINE THAT'S IN OUR TRUCK. I'M READY TO DROP THESE CYLINDERS IN RIGHT NOW. WELL, HE'S NOT GOING TO. OH, YOU GOT A MACHINE THAT DOES? I THOUGHT YOU WOULD. GOT THIS TRUCK LOADED, BROUGHT IT UP HERE, AND WE'RE GONNA PUT IT ON TRACK AND SEE HOW IT HANGS WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS' TRUCK. I'D SAY I AM GREATLY OUTMATCHED. LET'S GO RIGHT HERE. WHY NOT? SO, WE GOT ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO FINISH AARON'S SEMI THAT HE PLANS TO RACE IN COLORADO SPRINGS, AND WE'RE ALL DEFINITELY FEELING THE PRESSURE. DON'T TRIP ON THAT PIPE. I STARTED THE EXHAUST. 'CAUSE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN COLORADO SPRINGS, WE NEED A LOT OF HORSEPOWER AND GOOD AIRFLOW. BUILT A DOWNPIPE. AND THEN JONATHAN WENT TO GO GET ME SOME TUBING, SOME 5-INCH STAINLESS, SO I CAN CONNECT THE DOTS FROM THE DOWNPIPE TO WHERE WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OUTSIDE THE TRUCK. THE TURNOUT DOWN THERE, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT BECAUSE IT, LIKE, IT COMES DOWN AND THEN IT TURNS BACK UP. SO I MUST HAVE JUST CLOCKED IT WRONG WHEN I WAS SETTING IT UP, SO I GOT TO RECUT THE LOWER TURN SO THAT IT'S LEVEL WITH THE FRAME. NEED TO CUT. WE'RE PICKING AN EXHAUST SYSTEM BASED ON ITS SIZE, HOW MUCH VOLUME OF AIR IT CAN MOVE, AND THEN ITS LOCATION. I NEED SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH THE REST OF THE VEHICLE, IS MOUNTED INCREDIBLY STRONG, AND AESTHETICALLY IT LOOKS COOL. NOW THAT I'VE REWORKED THIS PIECE, I'M GONNA TEST-FIT IT AGAIN ON THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT'S ALL LEVEL. THAT ONE IS TOO TALL! JEREMY! HEY, CAN YOU GRAB ME A SMALL -- A SHORT JACK STAND, PLEZ? SO, BUILDING THE EXHAUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG TO DEAL WITH. THANK YOU. IT'S A JUNGLE GYM TRYING TO GET OUT OF HERE. IT IS ALL JUST SUPER HEAVY. SO I HAD JP CRAWL UNDER WITH ME AND HELP ME OUT, YOU KNOW? THANK YOU. SO... THANKS, JP. OH, YEAH. IS THAT PUSHED ALL THE WAY UP WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE? I THINK. CAN YOU GRAB A LEVEL AND MAKE SURE IT'S PARALLEL WITH THE FRAME? OKAY. THERE YOU GO. THERE IT IS. - IS IT? - IS IT? PERFECT. ALL RIGHT. JUST LIKE YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE GOT TO BUILD A ROLL CAGE. WHAT'S THE ROOF LIKE? IS IT FLAT? UH, NO. THIS RACE CAR IS 12,000 POUNDS. LET'S SEE WHAT THE DOOR OPENING IS ON IT. SO WHAT'S THE DOOR OPENING? THIS IS THREE TIMES THE WEIGHT OF A NORMAL RACE CAR. 210?WHICH SIDE IS HIGH? - THE RIGHT SIDE. - SO IT'S UP LIKE THIS. SO IT'S GOING DOWN. - YEAH. - 2 DEGREES? UH, YEAH. OKAY. THAT BEING SAID, IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF STICKS, THE RIGHT SIZE OF STICKS, AND HAVE THEM IN THE RIGHT SPOT. RACING IS A VERY ON-THE-EDGE KIND OF THING. CARS CRASH. AND THEY CRASH OFTEN. SO, WITH HIGH SPEED AND HIGH PROBABILITY OF WRECKING THE VEHICLE, WE NEED A VERY STRONG CAGE. THAT'S CURVED SLIGHTLY I THINK. THERE MIGHT BE A FLAT SPOT IN IT. - YEAH. - YEAH, YEAH. SEE WHAT LOOKS GOOD IN THERE, AND THEN JUST CHECK THAT ANGLE. IT'S HAD A HARD LIFE. IT'S GOT EVIDENCE OF BEING HIT BEFORE. SO WHEN WE BUILD THE CAGE, WE LIKE TO BUILD IT, YOU KNOW, I CALL IT "DEAD-NUTS ON," JUST COMPLETELY SQUARE AND STRAIGHT. BUT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO PUT IT INSIDE OF THIS BOX SITTING ON TOP OF THIS GREAT BIG FRAME, AND SO MANY OF THESE THINGS AREN'T SQUARE. AND WE ARE DEALING WITH VERY LITTLE TIME ON THIS THING. .105 IS THE DISTANCE PER ANGLE. DOING MATH WITH BENDS IS NEW TO ME. THIS CAGE FOR THE SEMI-TRUCK IS PRETTY TRICKY. IT HAS A TON OF BENDS AND NOTCHES AND THINGS TO BE MADE. ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT NUMBERS ON IT. ARE YOU USING THAT CALCULATION THAT YOU HAD ON THE PAPER? IT'S LONG-ASS FORMULA, ISN'T IT? NO, NO. SO... CLR TIMES TWO, AND THEN DIAMETER TIMES PI. SO, YOUR CENTERLINE RADIUS. SO SAY IT'S, LIKE, CYLINDERS ARE HERE. CLR IS 6 INCHES. THAT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE TUBE. - MM-HMM. - SO CLR BY TWO IS 12. WE TAKE THAT AND WE DIVIDE THAT BY TWO. AND THEN, SO WE'VE GOT 12 TIMES 3.14 DIVIDED BY 360. 1046... I ROUNDED UP TO .105, TIMES 28. TIMES THE AMOUNT OF DEGREES. SO THAT'D BE .105. SO THE BEND RADIUS IS 3.20... AND TWO. HM. SO, THAT'S WAY WEIRD. PRETTY LUCKY TO HAVE A MATHEMATICAL GENIUS ON MY HANDS, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET TO WORK WITH RAIN MAN. SO, IT'S IMPORTANT TO BALANCE WHAT WE NEED TO GET THE JOB DONE AND WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. REALLY, WE END UP WHAT IS CALLED "SPLITTING HAIRS," TRYING TO FIND THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING. TELL ME WHEN IT SNUGS UP. YOU WANT THINGS A LITTLE TIGHTER, BUT THE TIGHTER YOU WANT THEM, THE MORE DIFFICULT THEY ARE. OOH, IT'S GONNA FIGHT, IT'S GONNA FIGHT. BOY, THIS WAS EASIER TO PUT IN WHEN IT DIDN'T FIT. WE HAVE TO NIP A LITTLE MORE OFF THE TAIL. SO, WE'VE JUST HAD TO LOOSEN UP THE CAGE WHERE I REALLY WANTED IT, AND THEN WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT. AND ULTIMATELY, IT FITS PRETTY GOOD. MODIFYING THIS SERIES 60 ENGINE HAS ME SO CURIOUS ABOUT IT. WHEN BOB OFFERED A TOUR OF DETROIT REMAN, I COULDN'T RESIST. HEY. WHAT'S GOIN' ON, BOB? YOU MADE IT. YES, SIR. ABSOLUTELY. GOOD SEEING YOU. THIS IS JOSH. JOSH? NICE TO MEET YOU.NICE TO MEET YOU. WELCOME TO DETROIT REMANUFACTURING. WELL, THANKS FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. SO, BOB INVITED ME UP TO DETROIT REMAN TO CHECK OUT THEIR FACILITY. WORKING ON MY SERIES 60 REALLY GOT MY CURIOSITY GOING ABOUT HOW THESE ENGINES ARE BUILT. AND SINCE I TRUST THE GUYS BACK AT THE SHOP TO KEEP THINGS MOVING ON THE TRUCK, I COULDN'T TURN DOWN THIS OPPORTUNITY. SO THIS IS WHERE THE TIRED OLD MOTORS THAT HAVE DONE THEIR JOB, PUT IN THEIR SERVICE, AND THEY COME HERE TO GET A NEW LIFE, RIGHT? THAT'S IT. WE LOOK AT THOSE AS OUR RAW MATERIALS. DETROIT DIESEL MOTORS ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICAN TRUCKING. AT DETROIT REMAN, THEY REHAB THESE INTO SECOND-LIFE. SO I'M SPENDING A LITTLE TIME HERE IN THE SHOP LEARNING MORE ABOUT THEIR SYSTEMS AND HOW THESE MONSTROSITIES GO TOGETHER. AND THAT'S A GREAT AFTERNOON OUT. I'M GONNA HAND YOU OFF WITH BOB. YOU READY TO ROCK? YOU WANT TO WALK UP THIS WAY? YEAH, LET'S DO IT, MAN. YOU SEE THIS ENGINE RIGHT HERE? IT'S GETTING READY TO START THE TEAR-DOWN PROCESS. YEP. IT COMES ON DOWN THE LINE. AND HE DISASSEMBLES. AND JUST GET IT DOWN THE THE RAW MOTOR? EXACTLY. ON THE SEMI HE'S CURRENTLY MAKING, IT HAS A MILLION MILES ON IT. I TOLD HIM, YOU REALLY JUST NEED TO COME SEE THE PROCESSES. I'LL SHOW YOU WHY OUR REMAN PRODUCTS ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THE NEW. HOW COOL IS IT THIS MOTOR'S ALMOST AS TALL AS ME? TODAY, WE CAME UP HERE TO LEARN ABOUT THE DETROIT SERIES 60. I CAME HERE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ENGINE THAT'S IN OUR TRUCK. I NEVER HAD ONE APART. NEVER HAD A REASON TO. NEVER EVEN OWNED ONE. NOW THAT I DO, THE CURIOSITY'S THAT MUCH BIGGER. NOW WE GET DOWN TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE OILING UP A FEW O-RINGS, DROP THESE CYLINDERS IN RIGHT NOW. OH, HE'S NOT GOING TO. OH, YOU GOT A MACHINE THAT DOES? I THOUGHT YOU WOULD. OH, LET'S DO IT. EVERYONE SHOWS UP TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT QUALITIES AND DIFFERENT ABILITIES AND TALENTS. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - BRIAN. - AARON. NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU HAVE THE PERSON HANDLE A VERY -- A SMALL SET OF REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY CAN DO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITHOUT FATIGUE. WE LOADING ALL SIX? YEAH. EVERY ONE OF THEM. WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT, YOU GET TO PUT THE BIG CRANK SHAFT IN. SO, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE PUT CYLINDERS INTO A BLOCK LIKE THIS. YOU HAVE TO CHECK THE LINER HEAD ON EACH ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET THE PROPER SEAL ON YOUR COMPRESSION. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT TO BE EVEN... OKAY. ...WITHIN THE SPECIFICATION. YOU'RE CHECKING MULTIPLE POINTS TO MAKE IT SURE IT CROSSES IT. - CORRECT. - OKAY. THERE'S A LOT OF TOOLS IN HERE THAT ARE BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR DOING ONE JOB -- NOT MULTIPLE JOBS, OR TWO. THEY DO ONE JOB. BYE. OH, NO. IT'S COMING BACK TO SEE YOU. OH, IT FLIPS IT THE OTHER WAY. - YEAH. - NOW WHAT? INSTALL THE CRANK SHAFTS. UH-OH. THERE IT GOES. SO, I PUT AARON TO WORK FOR A LITTLE BIT TODAY. HE DID GREAT. I WOULD SAY IT SPINS PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY. I AM A BIG FAN OF INSTEAD OF BUYING NEW, MAINTAINING... KEEPING GOING. I THINK COMING HERE AND FINDING A BENCHMARK OF WHAT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING IN THE AUTOMOTIVE WORLD, CUSTOM AUTOMOTIVE WORLD, CAN BE... I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MY LONG-TERM GOALS. I HAVEN'T WRECKED ANYTHING TODAY! - YEAH! - COOL. I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I APPRECIATE IT, MAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'VE GOT AN EVENT COMING UP WITH THE SEMI-TRUCK, AND I HAVEN'T RUN THE IN-FIELD TRACK. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I THINK THIS IS A VERY TIGHT COURSE FOR THE SEMI. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE... I THINK IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT. THESE GUYS RACE THESE TRUCKS AND THEY RACE THEM HARD, AND SO THIS COULD GO GOOD, OR THIS COULD BE A REALLY GREAT JOKE. ALRIGHT, CHRIS. LET'S GET THESE AIR BRAKES INSTALLED. HEY, WAS THERE WASHERS BEHIND THE DISC BEFORE? NO. MNH-MNH. SINCE WE'RE NO LONGER TRYING TO HAUL 80,000-POUND LOADS OVER THE ROAD, WE'RE SWAPPING OUT THE OLD DRUM BRAKES FOR NEWER, LIGHTER, MORE EFFICIENT DRUM BRAKES, MORE SUITABLE FOR A 12,000-POUND RACE TRUCK. THAT'S BASICALLY OFF A LITTLE BIT. WEIGHT IS EVERYTHING. AND ALTHOUGH THE OFFICIAL RULES STATE THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM OF 11,500 POUNDS, WE STRIPPED ALL THE UNNECESSARY EQUIPMENT OFF THIS TRUCK. THE DASH, THE INTERIOR, AND EVEN OUR HEAVY DRUM BREAKS. GIVE ME 1 INCH ONLY ON THE ROD. I'M KIND OF GETTING THE MEASUREMENTS, HE'S CUTTING THE UNNECESSARY PART OF THE SHAFT OFF, SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT ALL FIT. THAT'S THE 1-INCH YOU ASKED FOR. YEAH, I KNOW. THERE'S NO MEASUREMENTS, YOU KNOW? SO IT'S ALL TRIAL AND ERROR. WELL, I DON'T HAVE A BRAKE, SO WE BETTER HOPE IT'S RIGHT. YOU'LL BE AN AIR-BRAKE EXPERT BEFORE WE'RE DONE. WHAT THIS TRUCK'S ABOUT TO DO, WE WANT THE MAXIMUM BRAKING AS POSSIBLE. IF HE HAS TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES, I WANT THEM THINGS TO LOCK UP. THIS AIN'T MOVING IT. YEAH, SO I SAY THAT SOUNDS GOOD. BUT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ONLY STOPPING A 12,000-POUND RACE TRUCK INSTEAD OF AN 80,000-POUND TRAILER, WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BRAKES AND THAT'S HEAT AND AARON'S GOT A PLAN FOR THAT. SO, WE NEED MPT TO 1/4"-D.O.T.s. ON -- WE NEED THE FOUR. AND THEN WE NEED A 1/4" MPT TO PUSH -- YOU KNOW, MATCH THAT. AND SEE IF WE CAN GET ENOUGH STUFF TO PLUM THE BRAKE SPARES. THESE TRUCKS HAVE DRUM BRAKES ALL THE WAY AROUND. THEY'RE VERY, VERY, VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S ON THE BACK OF AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK. HOWEVER, THEY WEREN'T DESIGNED TO BE APPLIED, LET-OFF APPLIED, LET-OFF APPLIED, LET-OFF, SO WE BUILD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEAT. AND AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE, THE BRAKES JUST NO LONGER CAN DO THEIR JOB, SO WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE HEAT OUT OF THE BRAKES, SO WE SPRAY WATER ON IT, THE WATER TURNS TO STEAM, AND IT EVAPORATES, AND THAT'S HOW WE REMOVE THE HEAT OUT OF THE BRAKES. WE HAVE BRAKE SPARES HERE. UH, THIS IS A FAN NOZZLE, SO IT WILL SPREAD OUT THE SPRAY AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS APPLYING WATER TO THE BRAKES. SO THAT IS -- THIS NOZZLE RIGHT HERE... IS GOING TO SPRAY WATER AT THE DRUM. WE WANT TO SPRAY THE DRUM BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE HEAT IS REALLY CREATED. WHEN THE WATER HITS THE DRUM, IT CREATES STEAM AND THE STEAM IS A NATURAL WAY TO GET HEAT OFF OF -- IT PULLS SOME OF THE HEAT OUT OF IT AND SENDS IT OUT TO THE ATMOSPHERE. UNDER THE SKIN, WE'RE INSTALLING A 20-GALLON TANK FOR WATER. FILL THIS UP WITH WATER AND IT WILL BE A GAUGE ON THE DASH. WHENEVER WE HIT THE BRAKES, IT WILL SPRAY, SO WE'RE ABLE TO USE THE BRAKES A LOT LONGER, WE CAN HAVE LONGER RACES, WE CAN HAVE MORE EFFECTIVE BRAKES ON MORE TURNS. IS IT FIGHTING YOU OR YOU THINK IT'S OKAY? UH, I HAVE A SIMILAR BRACKET. I'M COMING OFF OF THE STUDS HERE. HMM, OKAY. AND THEN, I'M SPRAYING RIGHT IN HERE. SO, BASICALLY I'M --OH, THAT ONE -- THAT ONE LOOKED LIKE IT WORKED OUT GOOD. AND THEN WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL COME UP WITH THAT WATER LINE. WE'LL COME UP AND SNAKE IT WITH THE BRAKE LINE. YEAH, FOLLOW -- FOLLOW IT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE. YEP. I THINK -- I THINK IT WILL BE FUN. COME ON, CHRIS. ONLY THREE MORE TO GO. GOD. WE'RE AT PIKES PEAK INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY, BETTER KNOWN AS PPIR, JUST A LITTLE SOUTH OF COLORADO SPRINGS. I GOT TIME-TRAVEL RACES COMING UP WITH THE BIG TRUCK, OUR SEMI-TRUCK, AND I'VE ONLY RACED IN A TRUCK ONCE BEFORE. AND LET ME TELL YOU, IT CAN GET ROUGH OUT THERE. IT'S UNLIKE ANY OTHER KIND OF RACING. AND AS FAR AS THIS TRACK IS CONCERNED, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, AND SO, I THINK TODAY MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO JUST COME OUT HERE AND TURN A COUPLE OF LAPS OR AT LEAST WALK THE TRACK AND SEE WHAT I'M UP AGAINST FOR UPCOMING COMPETITIONS. QUé PASA, MAN? - WHAT'S GOING ON? - NADA. I SEE YOU OUT HERE TEARING IT UP. ABSOLUTELY, MAN. JUST RUNNING SOME LAPS IN THE SCHOOL CARS. YEAH. I KNOW TOMMY. HE'S A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER. HE'S AN INSTRUCTOR. HE'S WELL-QUALIFIED. I KNOW WE'RE BRINGING THE BIG TRUCKS HERE, SO I WAS OF CURIOUS IF I COULD DO A LITTLE RECONNAISSANCE AND, UH, CHECK THE TRACK OUT. FOR SURE, MAN. WE CAN HOP IN AND DO SOME LAPS IN THIS G8. MY DAD IS INVOLVED WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF THE TRACK. HE'S ONE OF THE OWNERS HERE, SO I'VE BEEN AROUND THIS PLACE SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID. I'VE ACTUALLY GOT PICTURES OF ME IN MY GO-CARTS HERE GOING ACROSS THE START-FINISH LINE. I'VE SEEN YOUR DAD'S DATSUN PICKUP. I'D LOVE TO TAKE SOME LAPS IN THE DATSUN. IS THAT A POSSIBILITY? YEAH, UH, I THINK WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK. WE JUST GOT TO KEEP THAT THING SUNNY-SIDE UP. THAT'S A DEAL. LET'S DO IT. ALRIGHT, LET'S DO IT. THAT'S A LOT FASTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. IT RUNS PRETTY GOOD, DOESN'T IT? YEAH. IT'S ONLY, LIKE, A HUNDRED SOME HORSEPOWER, BUT... I'M ACTUALLY THE CHIEF DRIVING INSTRUCTOR HERE AT THE TRACK NOW, SO ANY TIME WE HAVE ANY SORT OF DRIVING PROGRAM, WHETHER IT BE A TEENAGE-DRIVING COURSE OR A RACING CLASS, I'M UP IN FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM, TELLING EVERYBODY WHAT TO DO. I'VE GOT MORE LAPS AROUND THIS PLACE THAN ANYBODY ON BOTH THE OVAL AND THE ROAD COURSE, WHICH DEFINITELY PLAYS TO MY ADVANTAGE. I THINK I'M GOING TO WORK WITH HIM A LITTLE BIT. I'LL GIVE HIM A FEW POINTERS. I WON'T GIVE HIM ALL MY TIPS AND TRICKS, BUT WE'LL GET HIM UP TO SPEED WITH THE REST OF THE GUYS. SURE, SURE. TOMMY'S DRIVEN ME AROUND A FEW LAPS, SHOWING ME HIS SPEED, HIS LINE, WHERE TO DO THIS, WHERE TO DO THAT. SO, PRETTY MUCH EASY AS THAT. NOW IT'S MY OPPORTUNITY TO HOP INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND SEE IF I CAN REPLICATE HIS SPEED AND HIS LINES. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. ALRIGHT, MAN. READY TO GIVE HER A GO? YEAH, LET'S DO IT. I'M ALWAYS LEERY OF DRIVING OTHER PEOPLE'S CARS, YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE -- IT'S A VERY PERSONAL THING. IT'S LIKE -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE WEARING SOMEONE ELSE'S UNDERWEAR, RIGHT? AND SO, I DON'T WANT TO WRECK HIS TRUCK, I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIS TRUCK, I DON'T WANT TO DAMAGE THE TRUCK, BUT I REALLY WANT TO DRIVE IT. OH, TOO LATE. THERE WE GO. I LIKE IT. I THINK THIS IS A VERY TIGHT COURSE FOR THE SEMI AND I GUESS THEY RACED INDY CARS HERE, SMALLER NASCARS HERE. SO THE TRACK WASN'T DESIGNED WITH SEMI-TRUCKS IN MIND. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE -- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. THE TRUCK'S VERY BIG. IT NEEDS A LOT OF ROOM TO CHANGE DIRECTION. IT'S -- WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR IT WITH THE SEMI. NO BRAKES HERE? OVERALL, I THINK I DID WELL. A LONG WAY FROM TOMMY'S PROFESSIONAL LINES, TOMMY'S SPEED, I REALIZE THAT. BUT I THINK I DID REALLY WELL AND, MORE THAN ANYTHING, I REALLY ENJOYED IT. WHAT A WILD DEAL. OH, YEAH. SO... GOOD WORK OUT THERE, MAN. I THINK WE'LL BE SET WHEN WE COME IN THE BIG TRUCKS... THANKS, MAN. ...AND BE PROUD. YEAH. I -- I CAN'T WAIT. WE DEFINITELY HAVE SOME CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US, BUT THE BIGGEST ONE IS GETTING BACK TO DALLAS AND GETTING THE SEMI PREPPED TO COME UP HERE AND RUN THIS TRACK FOR REAL. - WE'LL SEE YA. - SEE YA. THANKS. HEY, THIS -- THIS BACK BAR IS TOUCHING. ESSENTIALLY, THE CAGE SHRUNK. MAYBE IF WE JACK THE FRONT OF THE CAB UP? BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO GET TO THE BACK OF THAT ROLL CAGE AND TRY AND DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE? I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT, MAN. YEAH. OH, IT'S DOPE. THEY'RE HEAVY. YEAH, I BET THEY ARE. I'D GET THEM OUT OF THE BACK OF THE TRUCK WITH A FORKLIFT. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS FOUR BRAND NEW WHEELS, FOUR BRAND-NEW TIRES FOR OUR RIG. AND WE GOT THEM OUT OF THE BALANCE JUST NOW AND THEY'RE READY TO GO. YEAH, THEY'RE REALLY BIG, THEY'RE REALLY HEAVY, AND I DON'T WANT TO UNLOAD THEM. UH, I MEAN, TODAY I KIND OF HATE MY INTESTINES, SO -- YEAH, LET'S JUST GO AND PFFT THAT OUT. THAT WAS THE SOUND OF THE INTESTINES STARTING TO COME OUT. HOW BAD IS IT? - YOU'RE GOING TO HELP HIM NOW? - I'M GOING TO HELP HIM. YEAH, WE'RE JUST GONNA -- WE'RE JUST GONNA ROLL THEM OFF, SEND THEM OFF IN THE SUNSET. FOR A GUY THAT WORKS OUT EVERY DAY, YOU SEEM AWFUL AFRAID OF IT. HEY, JON. TELL ME ABOUT THAT BALANCING THEY DID ON IT. THEY DID. THEY STUCK WEIGHTS TO IT. HOW EFFECTIVE THEY'RE GOING TO BE I DON'T KNOW, BUT... WE'LL FIND OUT, WON'T WE? THEY STUCK SOME WEIGHTS ON THERE. ALRIGHT, ONE, TWO, THREE. SEND IT. AND HE'S WALKING AWAY. YEP. THANKS. THANKS. SO, ONCE CHRIS GETS THOSE HEAVY WHEELS AND TIRES INSTALLED ONTO THE SEMI, IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME TO TAKE A MEASUREMENT TO SEE HOW MUCH THE WHOLE TRUCK WEIGHS. SO, SHE'S GOING TO ROLL. UH-HUH. SINCE THE BIG RIG RACING SERIES RULES SAID A MINIMUM OF 11,500 POUNDS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PLAYING FIELD LEVEL... AS FAR AS THE WEIGHT GOES, I EXPECT HIGH NUMBERS. I MEAN, IT'S -- IT'S A SEMI TRUCK, SO, I MEAN, I DEFINITELY EXPECTED BIG NUMBERS. THE FRONT'S A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER THAN THE REAR. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. 1,820 AND 38,000. THAT'S NOT BAD. THAT'S BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE. YEAH. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE SUPERNOSE-HEAVY. WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THIS TRUCK AS CLOSE TO THE 11,500-POUND MINIMUM LIMIT AS WE CAN AND ALSO GIVE AARON EVERYTHING THAT HE WANTS AND I THINK WE'RE RIGHT IN THERE. THOSE NUMBERS DON'T SURPRISE ME, AT ALL. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE A FULLY LOADED -- 6, 70 -- SO YOU GOT 76 BACK HERE AND THEN FOUR 11s -- SO 11-SOMETHING NOW? THESE ARE OUR CURRENT WEIGHTING MEASUREMENTS RIGHT NOW. WE STILL GOT PROBABLY 500 POUNDS OF STUFF THAT IS STILL ACTUALLY GOING TO GO ON THE TRUCK. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE SITTING AT 11,290. MINIMUM WEIGHT'S WHAT? 11,500. 11,500? YEAH. OH, WHEN WE GET THE REST OF THE CRAP ON THERE, WE'LL BE EVERY BIT OF THAT. YEAH, BUT, I MEAN, CURRENTLY, IT'S SHORT A FEW ALUMINUM PANELS, TWO WINGS, TWO LITTLE PIECES OF GLASS -- 40 FOOTS OF STICK. AT LEAST, 'CAUSE... - OH, GOING ON THE BACK OF IT. - YEAH, YEAH. WE'LL BE PUSHING RIGHT AT 12 OR A LITTLE OVER 12 WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE ON RACE DAY. PROBABLY 250 MISCELLANEOUS. WE'LL BE -- WE'LL BE 600 POUNDS HEAVIER THAN WE ARE NOW. YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. 12,000 POUNDS. AND HEADLIGHTS. FOR A WHILE. 'TIL SOMEONE KNOCKS THEM OUT. NOW THAT WE SUCCESSFULLY WEIGHED THE TRUCK, WE CAN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO FINISHING THE ROLL CAGE. ARE WE SLEEVING BACK HERE AND THEN DIVING DOWN TO THE, UH, SPRING ARCHES, RIGHT? THIS ONE -- TO THE PASSENGER SIDE. THAT ONE -- PBHT! INTERSECT THROUGH. AND, UH, KICKERS COVER THE RACK OR NO? PROBABLY. THEY'LL -- PBHT, PBHT. SO, THE INSIDE OF THE ROLL CAGE IS IN PLACE, BUT WE HAVE TO SECURE IT TO THE CHASSIS WITH AN X-FRAME THAT WILL GO ACROSS THE BACK. THE TRUCKS WE'RE RACING AGAINST IN COLORADO SPRINGS ALL WEIGH IN THE BALLPARK OF 12,000 POUNDS, SO IT'S IMPORTANT THIS ROLL CAGE IS SECURED AND WELDED TO THE CHASSIS AND NOT COMPROMISED IN ANY WAY. SO THERE TO THERE? AND THEN, THERE TO THERE? WHOA. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. BRAKE! I'VE TOUCHED IT! I'VE GOT... PROBABLY 15, 20 BARS STILL TO BUILD AND BEND AND NOTCH AND PUT IN THE TRUCK, SO, ON TOP OF BUILDING SEAT BRACKETS FOR THE SEATS... - MAYBE? - I'M JUST ASKING. OKAY. THAT'S JEREMY OVER THERE. UM. HEY. HEY. THIS IS TABITHA.SORRY. I MEAN, WE'LL MAKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT, WE HAVE TO MAKE IT, SO IT'S JUST -- JUST GOT TO PUT IN THE TIME AND STOP DILLY-DALLYING. I'LL PACK EVERYTHING TOGETHER IN HERE. TELL HER TO QUIT MOVING. HEY, THIS -- THIS BACK BAR IS TOUCHING. HUH? THE BACK BAR. SO, AFTER WE WERE WELDING SOME OF THE CAGE UP, THE EXTERIOR AND THE INTERIOR, THE CAGE MOVES, SO WHEN YOU WELD EVERYTHING IT GETS HOT AND COOLS AND EVERYTHING KIND OF SHRINKS AND DOES WHAT IT WANTS TO. WELL, WE HAD TO REDO THE X ON THE INTERIOR OF THE CAB 'CAUSE ESSENTIALLY THE CAGE SHRUNK. I MEAN... TELL ME. WE CAN'T GET TO THE BACKSIDE OF THE WELD, OF THE TUBES, ON THE X? UH-HUH. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET BACK THERE. MAYBE IF WE JACKED THE FRONT OF THE CAB UP, TAKE THE BOLTS OUT, JACK THE CAB UP, AND ROCK IT BACKWARDS. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. WHY? 'CAUSE YOUR FIRM-ASS FIT OF THE TUBES COMING THROUGH THE CAB. SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND MAKE OUR FINAL WELDS, BUT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH THE BACKSIDE WITH OUR WELDING TORCHES. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IS LEAVE THIS BOTTOM X OUT AND THAT WAY WE CAN... WORK OUR WAY IN THERE. NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO WORK, EITHER. HOW THE DO WE EVEN GET THE TUBE OUT? YOU HAVE TO PULL THIS MAIN B-BAR OUT. YEAH, SO HOW'RE YOU GOING TO DO THAT? HMM, I DON'T KNOW. MM-HMM. YEAH, EXACTLY. WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE BACK OF THAT ROLL CAGE AND TRY AND DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE NOW WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER. I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO. HEY, THIS -- THIS BACK-BAR IS TOUCHING. THIS CAGE FOR THE SEMI-TRUCK IS PRETTY TRICKY. MAYBE IF WE JACKED THE FRONT OF THE CAB UP. THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. ESSENTIALLY THE CAGE SHRUNK. THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER. WE'RE TAKING THIS TRUCK TO COMPETE IN COLORADO SPRINGS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. OUTRIGHT BATTLE ROYALE, I THINK. MAN, WE DON'T -- WE DON'T EXACTLY WANT TO SEE YOU GIVE US JUNK WHEN THE GUY OWES US THIS STUFF, BUT... CHRIS RUSHMAN GOT A HEART OF GOLD, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT. I SQUISHED ONE DOWN IN THERE. SOME THINGS WE CHUCK. WHAT HAPPENED? - HUH? - WHAT DID YOU SAY? KENWORTH DRIVERS AIN'T GOING TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH ABOUT THEIR METHOD -- THEY SMEAR IT UP AND TAKE OFF AND THEN THEY'RE DONE. WHAT DID HE JUST SAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT. I HEARD "KENWORTH" IN THERE SOMEWHERE. WE CAN'T GET TO THE BACKSIDE OF THE WELDS. HUH? SO, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET BACK THERE. WE'RE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW TO GET THIS TRUCK DONE FOR AARON TO RACE IN COLORADO SPRINGS AND WE HAD A BUMP IN THE ROAD WITH THE ROLL CAGE WITH THE BACK X. WE CAN'T REACH IT WITH OUR TORCHES TO MAKE THE FINAL WELDS. HOW THE DO WE EVEN GET THE TUBE OUT? I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO. BECAUSE WHEN WE WELDED PART OF THE ROLL CAGE, IT SHRUNK ITSELF, SO ME AND JASON HAD TO DISASSEMBLE IT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING FIT PROPERLY. AND WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE TRUCK IS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE FOR COLORADO SPRINGS, WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING NON-STOP TO GET EVERYTHING DONE. I SPENT 50 HOURS WORKING ON THIS CAGE, BUILDING IT AND IT'S NOT EASY TEARING IT ALL APART. PIECE OF. I'M TYPICALLY PRETTY LEVEL-HEADED. I DON'T LOSE MY COOL VERY EASY. HEY, HEY. WHEN I GOT NO SLEEP AND SOMETHING'S NOT GOING MY WAY, I JUST GET A LITTLE -- GET A LITTLE HOT-TEMPERED. ALRIGHT. PIECE OF. YOU KNOW, IT WAS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE'RE OUT OF TIME, WE'RE TRYING TO GET THINGS DONE. IT'S BEEN ROUGH, YOU KNOW? WE'VE BEEN GOING ON 24 HOURS AND NO SLEEP AND IT'S ONE MORE THING THAT'S ADDED TO THE LIST THAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR. SO, ALTHOUGH I THINK WE'LL GET IT DONE, WE'LL BE LUCKY IF WE GET IT FINISHED BY MORNING. SO THE GUYS WERE UP ALL-NIGHT FINISHING THE ROLL CAGE AND NOW WE'VE GOT LESS THAN 24 HOURS TO FINISH THE REST OF THE TRUCK. THINKING ABOUT THE STUFF WE HAVE LEFT TO DO IS EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING. WE JUST GOT TO KEEP PUSHING THROUGH. WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BRAKE BACK IN AND THEN WE GOT THE STRUCTURE THAT GOES IN BEHIND ALL THIS, GET IT ALL TIGHTENED UP. IS ALL THIS PERMANENTLY PUT IN THERE? I FEEL LIKE IT'S MISSING SOME BOLTS AND STUFF. OH, WELL, THIS ONE'S NOT -- YOU SEE THAT CAB EXTENSION? LIKE, THE BRACKET -- YOU KNOW, SO THERE'S TWO BIG BOLTS... OH, YEAH. THERE'S TWO MISSING THERE. AS SOON AS I GET THAT DONE I'LL MAKE THE MOUNT FOR THE GAUGES. SO, AS WE GET DOWN TO THE LAST HOURS OF THIS THING, WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS PURELY BASED ON, "WHAT DO WE HAVE THAT MAKES THIS TRUCK GO, STOP, AND TURN?" IT LOOKS BRAND-NEW. WELL, THAT'S JUST A STICKER. HOW DOES IT FEEL ON THE INSIDE? DIRTY, UNFINISHED. NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. YOU KNOW, WE JUST GET DONE WHAT WE HAVE TO AND DO AS NICE AS WE CAN. - HEY, AARON? - YEP? YOU HAVE THAT TORCH OUT RIGHT THERE? YEP. UH, YOU CAN TACK THIS FOR ME REAL QUICK. UH, TODAY'S THE LAST DAY ON OUR BUILD FOR THE SEMI-TRUCK HERE BEFORE WE GO TO COLORADO SPRINGS. STILL QUITE A FEW THINGS TO DO. WE'VE STILL GOT SEATS TO MOUNT, WE'VE STILL GOT A COUPLE OF SHEET-METAL PANELS TO MOUNT. HOW DID YOU GET IN THERE? WE HAVE SOME WIRING TO FINISH UP. DEADLINES CREEP UP ON YOU FIRST. THE NERVES WERE KIND OF THERE FOR ALL OF US -- YOU KNOW, ME, JEREMY, AND JON, ALL HAD OUR CONCERNS. IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME. I WISH WE COULD HAVE HANDLED UP ON SOME DETAILS A LITTLE MORE. JUST MAKE THINGS A LITTLE SLICKER, A LITTLE SHARPER, MAYBE A LITTLE BETTER THOUGHT OUT. ULTIMATELY, VERY HAPPY WITH THE TRUCK. VERY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT CAME OUT. THE LAST -- YOU KNOW, THE LAST 40 HOURS OF THIS BUILD DIDN'T HAPPEN OVER ONE WEEK. IT HAPPENED OVER TWO DAYS. WE PACKED EVERYTHING TOGETHER, WE SLAMMED EVERYTHING IN THERE, BROUGHT IT UP HERE, AND, UM, WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON TRACK AND SEE IF IT CAN COMPETE WITH SOME OF THE FASTEST RIGS IN THE COUNTRY. THESE GUYS RACE THESE TRUCKS AND THEY RACE THEM HARD AND SO, THIS COULD GO GOOD OR THIS COULD BE A REALLY GREAT JOKE. THESE GUYS ARE WELL-EXPERIENCED TO SAY THE LEAST. WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IN THIS VERSUS MINE, WELL, I'D SAY I AM GREATLY OUTMATCHED. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. OUTRIGHT BATTLE ROYALE, I THINK. I'LL SEE IF MY SEMI-RACE CAR WILL HOLD UP AGAINST THE PROFESSIONALS. IF NOTHING ELSE, IT WILL BE INTERESTING. YEAH, YEAH. MAKE DADDY PROUD! UH-OH. UH-OH. OH! YEAH!!
