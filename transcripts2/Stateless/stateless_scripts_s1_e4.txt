 This is the real Eva Hoffman. You're stuck here indefinitely unless you tell me who you really are. They would want us to keep going, to live the best lives we can in our new home. Cleared of any wrongdoing. What? MINA: We know that man. Don't we, Pedar? No! No, no. Uh, I don't think so. You can tell David Meakin he's lost his source. She's banned until further notice. There is a protest on Sunday.

 Those photographs, they're just the beginning. Come on, boys. Wash up, please. Are you planning something else? I'm not, Cameron, I promise. CLARE: We're gonna need backup. We need to send a strong message to the protesters not to try anything stupid. The UNCs have to know that we are in control. I know what you're planning, and I'm coming with you. Dark chocolate for you, son. Oh, no, I'd prefer milk, Harry. Mmm. Cheers. Knock yourself out. Happy Easter. Mini for you, sweetie. Soft centre for you. Nah! We've hardened you up.

 Right, those protesters can put up a fight, so saddle up. They might smell like fuckin' patchouli, but they know how to land a punch. Just remember, those nuns can be real mongrels. Alright, helmets and shields. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Let's go! (SIGHS) Riot police? It's a bit of overkill, don't you think? (INDISTINCT VOICES ON RADIOS) KORVO officers, take up positions between the internal and external gates. Two metres between each officer. Protesters are believed to be arriving from the north-east and south-west. (CLOSING GATE RATTLES) PRIEST: Jesus took a loaf of bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it. Jesus said, "Eat of this, for this is my body, broken for you." "Take and drink from this, for this is the chalice of my blood." The Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world. Happy are those who dine at his supper. Hey. Why didn't you come over to see Mosi last night? Ameer, we are back together again, the three amigos. We must celebrate. TEDDY: Alright, boys, lockdown time. You can come out when the tambourine players go home. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) (FENCE RATTLES) TEDDY: Alright, everyone in the men's compound. Inside! The body of Christ. (ELECTRONIC BUZZING) Body of Christ. The father needs to be driven to the exit. Nah. I can't leave the compound. He's an old man, and in this heat... (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Alright. Come on, Father. Let's go through, mate. (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) (DOOR CLOSES AND LOCKS) (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) ..requiring escort from sick bay back to Sierra. Over. (MAN SCOFFS) CLARE: (OVER MICROPHONE) Thank you, everyone, for coming out here today. We have reliable intelligence that today's protest will be of a large scale. Our responsibility is to make sure we do everything to prevent it from escalating. That said, please refrain from undue force. (VEHICLE APPROACHES) (HORN HONKS) (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) MAN: Come on, guys! Let's do it! MAN 2: Play us a song, mate! Well, I'm terrified. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Hey. Hey. What do you mean? No, Mina. That's not how it works. I have an interview time. We do things the right way. You stay right away from those women. PROTESTERS: # Lead, kindly light # Amidst the encircling gloom # Lead thou... # We're here to bear witness to what's happening inside these camps! We are here to hold the government accountable for locking up innocent men, women... (WHISTLES) ..and children! (PROTESTERS CHEER) There are people who've been inside this camp for five years! They are not criminals! Everyone has the legal right to seek asylum! So we say freedom! Azadi! Freedom! PROTESTERS: Azadi! JANICE AND PROTESTERS: Azadi! Freedom! Azadi! Freedom! GORDON: Sofie, what are you doing? Stage fright, Sofie? Do you want everyone in this room to fail utterly to achieve their true potential, just like you? (PANTS) (THUMPING ON HARD SURFACE) JAVAD: Hello? (THUMPING ON HARD SURFACE) MAN: Close the camp! (THUMPS SURFACE) Officer? Hello? Officer, can you open up? (THUMPS SURFACE) Mr Dyson, how are you today? Yeah, good. Good? Yeah, uh, I have a big problem being inside here. I...I can't help you with visas and stuff. No, no visa. Inside here, my toilet is blocked. Please can you check? Right there. PROTESTERS: What do we want? Close the camps! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Close the camps! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Close the camps! When do we want it? Now! What do we want? Oh, God. Smell is not perfume, you know. (GROANS) Don't! Don't! When do we want it? Now! Help! (THUMPS DOOR) What do we want? Close the camps! Help! Help! Close the camps! When do we want it? (PHONE RINGS) Now! What do we want? Close the camps! Hello? You said this was gonna be a mass demonstration. And I'm looking at pictures of a mardi gras. I thought it necessary to take precautionary measures, given the recent... Not at 13K per fucking nun, it's not. The damage from a riot will cost double that. Oh, just send the police home. KORVO can handle some singing nuns. (PROTESTERS SHOUT AND CHANT) Ah, shit! (BEEP) MAN: This is code sign Gillespie. Lost visibility on Camera 15. Officer to respond. Over. Code sign Sandford. Uh, roger that. I'll take a look. Over. PROTESTER: This government does not care about the UN Convention. We have to speak out. We ARE going to make a difference. More protesters are arriving. The police are staying. BRIAN: Officers, take up positions along the outer fence. (PROTESTERS SHOUT) PROTESTER: No hate, no fear! Refugees are welcome here! No hate, no fear! Refugees are welcome here! PROTESTERS: No hate, no fear! Freedom! No fear! Refugees... (PEOPLE PANT) (PROTESTERS SHOUT AND CHANT) No protest! (SHOUTING) MAN: Freedom! WOMAN: Get off me! Shut it down! PROTESTERS: Freedom! Come on! Yes, yes! What do we want? Get your hands off me! WOMAN: Close it down! Hey! Shut this down! Arrest them! Shut it...shut this down. I can't arrest them for flying kites! Well, arrest them for invading prohibited airspace. Now! BRIAN: Someone on the fence! You will be arrested and charged with trespassing and wilful destruction of public property! (BEEPING) (INAUDIBLE) Fuck me! Fuck! CLARE: What? PEL-139 has broken out of isolation. CERT 1, CERT 1, at Sierra Compound! There's an escape in progress! Escape in progress! Over! (HANDCUFFS CLICK) (SHOUTING) Ugh! (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) Quick, let's go! Quick! Go, go, go, go! (GROANS) Help! Help me, please! Please! I'm caught. (PANTS) Oh, thank you so much! Please hurry! Oh, oh! Go! Oh, thank you so... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh! (PANTS AND LAUGHS) (MAN GROANS) AMEER: Mina! MAN: Please, Mr Cam! I have no other way out of here. Please! Please! Please let me go! Please, let me go! You are a good man, Mr Cam. No-one needs to know! (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Please! (PROTESTERS CHANT) The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! OFFICER: Party's over. The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! The world is watching! (PANTS) (JAZZY MUSIC PLAYS) (MUSIC STOPS) (DEVICE CLICKS REPEATEDLY) BRIAN: Anyone with knowledge of the breakout will come forward immediately. There will be severe consequences for anyone helping the escapees. Any officers withholding information, in accordance with Annex E of your contract, will be dismissed. Occupancy check complete. We have five UNCs unaccounted for. BT-345, POR-076, PEL-139, IND-143, IND-058. Alright. Thank you, everyone. As you were. Get out. Out! (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Sandford. Uh, your sister has been visiting PEL-139 for months now. Mm-hm. It's a serious offence to aid and abet an escape from a government facility. Yeah? Yep. Come on. You're an honourable bloke, Sandford. I know you wouldn't breach your contract and risk dismissal by not speaking up. I don't know anything, sir. (SIGHS) (RECIPIENT'S PHONE RINGS) Hey, you've reached Janice. Please leave a message. (BEEP) Hey. You fuckin' lied to me. You lied to me. I saw your car. Did you plan this shit? Mmm? Did you? Fuck. (PHONE CLATTERS) I told you to stay away from them. You heard Mr Brian. This will affect our visa! (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON LOUDSPEAKER) You think you know more than me now? But you do not respect me. I do! Then listen to me! We only have one chance at this, Mina, and we must do everything possible to succeed. Do you understand me? We cannot be sent back. (PANTS) (SNIFFS) (THUMPING ON HARD SURFACE) Please, I would really like to come back. PAT: No! Pat! (SIGHS AND SNIFFS) I'm not gonna let you destroy our way of life. You need to go home. (DOOR OPENS) GORDON: If you don't leave, I'll call the police. Well, I'll just tell them everything, and then I'll tell Pat. If you take your lies to Pat, or the police... ..then I'll tell them what you really are - a liar... ..and a whore. So if I were you, I would run far, far away. 'Cause if I ever lay eyes on you again, Sofie Werner... ..I'll destroy you. (SIGHS AND SNIFFS) (VEHICLE STOPS) Hey! You right? Get in. (OPENS DOOR) Come on. I'll drive you back to town. (SNIFFS) (CLOSES DOOR) You alright? Here. God, you're lucky I saw you. You'd be dead out here without water. Did the cops do that to you? Well, at least you got away and they didn't arrest you. Yeah. I...I am, uh, very lucky. They wonder why peaceful protests turn into riots. Mm-hm. Yeah, well, good on you for coming out and supporting the cause. Uh... ..it's a...a terrible place. Nobody should ever be kept in there. No, they should not. Mmm. Javad Shahrokh. His family are in community detention in Dighton Street. He won't be going anywhere without them. I'm on my way there now. MAN: Right. I'll meet you there. Thanks. (SIGHS) (ACCELERATES) (FENCE RATTLES) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (DOOR CLOSES) JANICE: Stay down as low as you can. (ALL SPEAK IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BOY: JANICE: The nuns will hide them for a few days, and then, when everything calms down, we'll smuggle them into the city. (PHONE RINGS) (HANDBRAKE CLICKS) POLICE OFFICER: So you're saying no guards were at the scene? MAN: We have issues at a number of centres. Were any guards stationed in the outdoor area? Where are they? But they should have been? Have they escaped? (HITS FENCE) I'm on my way to the sisters now. BRIAN: Look, Genevieve's got me on autodial. What am I supposed to tell her? It's not your job to talk to Canberra. We have an obligation to tell 'em, Clare. This is a critical situation. There are incident reports to file. Yeah, I don't give a fuck about incident reports! I will deal with Canberra. We just need to keep this away from the media. POLICE OFFICER: Alright. That'll be added to the report. DAVID: So how many guards are normally on duty? (PHONE RINGS) Excuse me. You'll need to wait. (SIGHS) (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) (SIGHS) Fuck off, Genevieve! (CAR STARTS) Shit! Keep right down. Pull over, please. JANICE: Shit, shit, shit! (ENGINE STOPS) You know how to drive? Uh, yes. OK. When I'm gone, you've got to take the car. There's a burner phone in the glove box. Stay off the highways. That's where there'll be roadblocks. And I'll...I'll, um...I'll text you directions to a safe house. No. Why can't you do it? He's coming over. As soon as I'm out of sight, go. (CLOSES DOOR) Hey, Bertie. Hey, how's your mum? I didn't see her at the library fundraiser. BERTIE: I need to have a chat with you about the escaped detainees. JAVAD: Eva? Go. Please go. Go, go, please. You and Sister Bernadette go out to Barton quite a lot. (ENGINE STARTS) You were so focused on a bunch of nuns, you didn't realise a prison break was happening in your own backyard! You want to point the finger at someone, point it at KORVO, for sloppy surveillance, untrained guards. I think the electorate will see eight UNCs on the run and a story plastered across every news bulletin in the country as Immigration's fucking responsibility. The security at Barton, which includes the fortification of the fences, is KORVO's remit. Accept responsibility, Kowitz, and back off out of the way so the AFP can get on with their job. (SHOUTING) WOMAN: Please! (CALL DISCONNECTS) Do you think you have won? Do you think you have won now? No, but I think you've lost any chance of getting a visa. So you think I will crack, huh? You think I will crack and plead you to go home, huh? I am Kurdish. I have no home. In Iran, they torture me. They rape me. But I survive, yeah. And I will survive your torture too. (SPITS) (SOBS) Put her in the car. You take me to your prison? You tell me, what is my crime? What is my crime? What is my crime? CLARE: Where are the others? Darwin? Let me remind you that under the Migration Act, Australia does not recognise church sanctuary, and anyone harbouring an unlawful non-citizen is committing a federal offence. (VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES) (ENGINE STARTS) JAVAD: This just came from Janice. At the crossing, go left and then straight up to, uh, Lake Booleroo. SOFIE: (SNIFFS) Um...I... ..I need to, uh, buy a plane ticket, please. Where to? Um... ..anywhere outside of, uh, Australia. You might have enough for a one-way ticket to Bali. Good. Can I see your passport? Um... ..yes. Thanks. You got any other ID? Uh, maybe a driver's licence? Miss? Miss! (SIGHS) It's a, um, self-help/performance group. They run sessions which they call 'transformative therapy' where they basically break you down and build you up as someone else. And you think this group had something to do with your sister's disappearance? Well, once she started going there, she stopped seeing her friends and family. They encouraged her to break off ties. I don't think... I mean, it's the first thing that cults do, so... Sorry, do you already know about them? I'm not at liberty to discuss an ongoing investigation. Jesus Christ! I think they've done something to my sister. I'm sorry. (JAVAD SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Janice says we must stay here until the...the police have stopped the search. I need the keys, Eva. There's food and water. WOMAN: LALEH: (WOMAN LAUGHS) JAVAD: Wah! Come, sit. Please. (JAVAD AND BOY CHATTER IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) BOY: Mama... JAVAD: Yeah? (LAUGHS) Mama? Mm-hm? (LAUGHS) (RAYAN LAUGHS) My name is Laleh. What's your name? (DOG BARKS) Where are they? Oh, you right? The police have already been, Cam. Yeah, you promised me there was nothing going on. There wasn't. I saw your car driving to pick 'em up! Did you arrange for the breakout? No. Huh? No! Huh? Don't lie to me. Where's your car? Being serviced. On Easter Sunday? You know, you use my kids to make your stupid posters and then you lie to my face. Nice. Cam! I didn't want to put you in a difficult position. What the fuck am I in now?! You know that Javad and Rosna have been sitting in there for four years? They've had every appeal rejected and neither of them can return to their own countries. Gonna tell me where they are? Need to go to the cops and tell 'em I saw ya? What, you really reckon I'd give up innocent people so you can keep your house with a bloody pool? (LAUGHS) Fuck you. No, come on. I mean, that's what this is about, isn't it? If you hadn't taken this job, you wouldn't give a shit what I was doing. I put my job on the line 'cause I told the truth. Yeah, and they didn't listen. And did you walk away? No. I reckon they'll listen now. Get out. (BEEP) (DOOR SLAMS) (HANDBRAKE CLICKS) DAVID: So, did I get you fired? Don't flatter yourself. Want a beer? (BOTTLES CLINK) (SIGHS) Think you'll find the rest of them? Yes, I do. Not that you'll report it. I'll report the facts. (SIGHS) I just don't know what I am doing out here. That's not a fact, by the way. Noted. I feel like I'm running from one crisis to the next. And if I fuck it up, I'm the one who'll wear it, not the department. You won't fuck it up, Kowie. You're too good at what you do. (CHILD LAUGHS) I don't think you mean that as a compliment. No. I didn't leave Sam. He always said he didn't want kids. But I turned 40... ..and all of a sudden, he passionately wanted them. I saw him six months ago, with his pregnant girlfriend. Oh. Sorry. Me too. (KISSES) (ROSNA SINGS SOFTLY) (SIGHS) Here. No. Why do you lie about who you are? In my country, it is normal to tell lies to the authority. You know, it's a dictatorship. But... ..here... ..you're a white girl. I don't understand. It isn't safe for me to say who I really am. Why not? Because someone might find me. Mmm. So you would rather... ..be in prison than tell the truth? Yes. If it...it meant that they would deport me, yes. So all you want to do is leave, and all we want to do is stay. You know, I have nothing. No papers. No rights. But my family, we are together. So I know I have a future. (TAPS KEYPAD) Good. You take those in to Oma and Opa. And no nibbling on the top, you. I'll make yours now. (PHONE RINGS) (BEEP) Margot Werner. (BREATHES SHAKILY) Hello? (SOFIE SOBS) Sofe, is that you? Margot? OK. Tell me where you are. No matter what trouble you're in, I will come and get you. We all love you so much. And we are going out of our minds looking for you. I'm so sorry. No, don't you ever be sorry, alright? If someone has hurt you, then it is not your fault. I went to that place, that GOPA place. I spoke to that man, Gordon Masters. Now, I've reported him to the police, so if he has done anything to you... He...he...he would kill me. If I went to the police, he would destroy me. Margot, I...I don't want the police. Just...look, tell me where you are. I am coming right now. Sofie? Sofie? (ENDS CALL) (SNIFFS) (SOBS) Sofe! She's alive! She needs to come home. (WOMAN SINGS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (LAUGHS) Mosi! (FENCE RATTLES) So we both made it to paradise. Have you had your interview? Of course. What did you tell them? (LAUGHS) We hold each other's balls in our hands, my friend. I would never risk myself, my chance at a visa. What about you? You have my word, my brother. ANGIE: You have to hand it in, Cam. (SIGHS) You risked your job when you told the truth about the bashing, and you did that because you believed that it was the right thing to do. Yeah? So why get the sack for something that you don't believe in? You've got to tell the cops what's on it! I can't dob in my own sister, can I? She lied to you! She...she used you. She broke the law. And you're still protecting her! (SIGHS) (BEEP) Hey, uh, Brian? Yeah, it's, uh...it's Sandford. Listen, mate, I, um... ..uh, I know where they are. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh...it's... ..it's just past Yorkeys Crossing, uh... ..just south of, uh... of Lake Booleroo. There's a...a...shack there. (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (WATER SPLASHES) (PANTS) MAN: Hey! (PLACES MUG ON TABLE) MAN: Hey! What are you doing? Oh, fuck! You're trespassing! (SOBS) No! No! No! (SOBS) No! No! (PANTS) Oh, fuck. Hamburg, 23 April 1970. 23 April 1970. Baba! Baba! (JAVAD SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You got some ID there? What's your name? It's not a difficult question, sweetheart. (DOOR CLOSES) (YELLS) RAYAN: Baba, Baba, Baba! No! No! Baba! Baba! Baba! Don't take them! Please, man. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Javad! OFFICER: What's your name? Eva. Eva Hoffman. JAVAD: Argh! (ENGINE IDLES) (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) HARRIET: (ON RADIO) Moving all escapees to isolation units. Over. WOMAN: (ON RADIO) Copy that, Tango 1. Over. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Well played, Sandford. You're a real Sherlock Holmes. (APPLAUSE) In you go, princess. (JAZZY MUSIC PLAYS) (RHYTHMIC CLAPPING) (DOOR CREAKS) (DOOR CLOSES AND LOCKS) Please. Don't punish my children. Please. BRIAN: Well... ..we live to serve another day. I want a report of KORVO's security mismanagement on my desk by the end of the week. (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSES) (KEY INSERTS IN LOCK) (DOOR OPENS) (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) (TRAY SLIDES) Sleep tight. (DOOR CLOSES) I'm in trouble, Farid. If they find out, they will never give you a visa. How did you pay for your passage to Australia? What was I supposed to do? That was the one chance that they had to be a family. You took that from them! You've, uh, come to experience the enduring aroma of a shitstorm? It's your job! Just do it! You... Please help me! MAN: Do you hear things? No. See things? Shh. Shh, shh. Do you think it was her on that flight? MAN: I don't know. This woman was handcuffed. They are angry. They don't know why...why they are being punished. We're not negotiating. Pedar! Pedar! Captions by Red Bee Media Copyright Australian Broadcasting Corporation
