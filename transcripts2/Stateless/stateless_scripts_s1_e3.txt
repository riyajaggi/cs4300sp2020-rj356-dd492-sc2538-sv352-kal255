 (GERMAN ACCENT) I am just a silly backpacker who has lost her passport. I'm not staying. I'm being deported. Have you seen my family? They must be here. There...there are places like this all over Australia. (BEEPING) Oh! You're not gonna make me take my veil off, are you, Cameron? Course not. Everybody get under cover! Inside! GENEVIEVE: You get those Tamils off the roof or I will send someone out there who can. We're leaving them there?

 Provided no-one can see them and they remain hydrated. (SOBS) Mina-jan! (SOBS) HARRIET: Hold him still. (COUGHS) They stop respecting us, this is what happens. GENEVIEVE: I sent you out there to get us OFF the news. (HANGS UP) (TRAIN HORN BLOWS) (PANTS) "Australia's detention regime is an example..." (GROANS) "..reflection of our highly developed..." (SIGHS) "..Australia...a reflection. "Australia's detention regime is a reflection

 "of our highly developed migration system..." ..enabling us to determine both the identity of asylum seekers and the legitimacy of their claims for protection. And it allows us to do that in a way that protects our national security and order. If you have a camera, we will find it! Do not impede the officers on their search! Follow all their directions! A detainee was assaulted in your facility. What about HIS safety? Well, of course, there will be an investigation conducted. But I want to reiterate that our staff are highly trained and fully cognisant of the sensibilities required to work at a centre such as Barton. Rise and shine, princess! Ohh! Our standards, in keeping with international guidelines, are among the highest in the world. This is a first-class facility. (SHOUTING) (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON LOUDSPEAKER) MAN: Every time! You're harassing us! You OK, brother? You gonna say anything? Are you? I saw the incident report. She's calling it reasonable and proportionate force. Get back! Get back! Stand back. (MAN SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) T-22! What would Allah say about that, eh? That isn't mine! Not mine! Mr Cam? Yeah. Good morning. Hi. May I speak with you about something? Not now, mate. Later. Alright? MAN: (SHOUTS) I don't have to do everything you say. You don't do everything... I found it! I found it! It was under the sink! (APPLAUSE) Alright. Found it! (APPLAUSE) CLARE: It has to be one of the single men because the camera was found in their compound. GENEVIEVE: Well, find out which one. And who they smuggled the memory card out to. This is a fucking disaster. The UNC has complained that the officers beat him without reason. No, hey, look. Hey, hang on a minute, OK? He's just one side of the story. I'm speaking with my officers and I've requested the security footage. So, that should tell us. Oh, good. Clare? Mm. Yep. Yes. I don't have to tell you how bad this looks. I am gonna find out what happened. No, you leave that to KORVO. I want you to focus on the leak. What if they get another camera in there and more pictures get out? You've gotta shut this down. That's my job. Yes, that's right. (ENDS CALL) (HANGS UP) I want a list of all visitors to UNCs in the last month. That's gonna be a long list. I want to know who the troublemakers are, who the complainers are. Who's not complying. That's gonna be a VERY long list. Brian, the UNC was beaten by your officers on your watch. Get me the list. Broke a wrist trying to break up a fight between the Shiahs and the Sunnis. Tore a ligament in my shoulder doing an uplift, and in my knee. Nearly had to have surgery. And, you know, the other day, the Mandaeans swung a kettle at me. Thank Christ it hadn't boiled. But, you know, does anyone care that we get the bash every other day? My mum does. Aw! She kiss you better too? (SNIGGERING) You, you and you, stay. The rest of you, back to work. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON TWO-WAY RADIO) Explain this to me. Now, how is it that the UNC sustained his injuries in one of only half-a-dozen places in this centre not covered by the CCTs? I thought everywhere was covered. This is a formal investigation. I will be interviewing each of you separately. Until that time, refrain from speaking to each other about the incident. Understood? Yes, boss. (SLAMS LAPTOP CLOSED) (INDISTINCT VOICES ON TWO-WAY RADIOS) We just have to stick together. We're all together or we all go down. Don't pussy out on me. (TAPS KEYS) (GASPS) Are you the case officer for TOR-076? The boat that sank. Oh, right. Yeah. Does the daughter have to remain in detention? Youth Services gave her the choice of returning to the foster family. She insisted on staying with her father. So they'll both get visas? Can't say 100%, but there's a clear history of persecution, so... ..a good chance. MINA: Pedar-jan. Pedar-jan! Pedar-jan! Please, pa sho... (FLIES BUZZ) MAN: You'll all get fed. Hey. Hey. (MEN SHOUT) Hey, no pushing. No pushing! FARID: Psst! Mina! How's your father? He sleep all time from pills they give him. He need a doctor, a real doctor. Leave it with me. OK? Uh, no food allowed out of the mess. My father, he need to eat. There's health regulations. Move along. Here. It's for your dad. Put it in your pocket. When the guards clear the door, go. Hey, hey! Get down from there! Get down from there! (SHOUTING) Oh, too slow! Get down off the table now. I'm warning you! Get down now! OK, everybody in their chairs! Get down! Get down now! Do this! Wear that! (SHOUTING) Line up! Lie down! Whoo! Oh! Get down! Get down! Sit down right now! # Da-da, da-da, da-da... # Oi! Hey! # Da-da, da-da, dum, da-dum! Ba! # Get off the table now. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) You think we are nothing, but we are something! We can be whoever we want to be! Because we are extraordinary! We are stars! We are brilliant, shining stars! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) JASON: You're pretending to be someone else. This is the real Eva Hoffman. She reported her passport stolen. It's a common name. Same date of birth, same place of birth. I have to go home to Germany. You don't understand. It is not safe for me here, in this country. Please! I'm sorry, but you're stuck here indefinitely unless you tell me who you really are. (SOBS) Shh! I am Eva Hoffman. MINA: Pa shodan. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Medication! (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON LOUDSPEAKER) MINA: He not need those. Please! Please don't give him. Don't let anyone else see that. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON TWO-WAY RADIO) (SIGHS) (ANNOUNCEMENT ALERT CHIMES) MAN: (ON LOUDSPEAKER) All detainees to refrain from using the Tango Compound laundry due to flooding. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON TWO-WAY RADIO) Hey. Smoke? Want a smoke? Here. Here. Have a smoke. It's OK. Mm. Here. Hmm. I saw your performance earlier. That was impressive. The world should know what they are doing to us here. Soon they will. Mm. On Sunday, people from outside, Australians, they are coming from everywhere to protest against this, how we are locked up, when all we seek is freedom. That is all I want. Good. Well, we need to be heard. We need to be seen. When you get out of here, and you will, people will be very interested in you. The lily among the reeds. They will want to know why someone who looks just like them trapped in a place like this. You could be our, uh, voice. The face of our suffering. Yes? No. Why not? What...? What...? You don't want to be seen? Hey! Hey, what are you running from? PAT: Sorry I can't be more of a help to you, Margot. MARGOT: When was the last time you saw her? New student, Pat? No. Gordon Masters. Uh, yes, the beating heart of our organisation. This is Margot Werner, Sofie's sister. Sofie's missing. I wondered if you'd heard from her. Oh, uh... ..she just stopped coming here. Such a shame. Yes, she had so much potential. Really thought she was going to win that trophy. The trophy? Of Transformation. It's our highest accolade. Sofie talked often of you, Margot. Did she? Often. I see the responsibility weighs heavily on you. I can... ..I can feel that. It's OK to let go, Margot. (TRAFFIC NOISE) (PRESSES CROSSING BUTTON) (WALK SIGNAL ACTIVATES) (INAUDIBLE) That one... ..and that one, and the two nuns, they're here the most. They all visited the day before the photograph was leaked. Who were they visiting? Half-a-dozen regulars, plus others. Their dance cards are full. I want everyone checked on their way out. Even the nuns? Especially the nuns. I went to a Catholic school. It is my understanding that my organisation has oversight of the day-to-day management of this centre. I'm taking a more active approach. JANICE: Don't touch the door, please! Don't touch ME, please! (HANDBRAKE CLICKS) No! Come on. Get out there. Right, wash the paint off your hands. (CLOSES CAR DOOR) Come on. Hurry up. Dad's here. Come on, boys. Hi, Dad! Hi, Daddy! Wash up, please. Come on. Wash them off. You, uh...you missing a camera? I don't know what you're talking about. Hey, it's my job, alright? Not your job, my job, you put on the line, OK? And you used a nun. Yeah, and a man ended up beaten half to death. Well, it's not that simple. Alright? Did you know about it? You think one photo shows what it's like, hmm? I think that one photo gets people to take notice and I think they need to see what the government is doing in their name. Fucked things happen when no-one's watching and when no-one speaks up about them! (BOYS LAUGH) (WATER SPLASHES) Come on, boys! Hey. Mum's waiting, please. Let's go. Come on. In the car. Cam, you can't... Good job. That's it. In the car. Come on, Charlie. Love you. Hey. What? What's this? (CAR DOORS CLOSE) Are you planning something else? I'm not, Cameron, I promise. (SCREEN DOOR OPENS) Janice always takes their side. The guy, he was violent and he hit you. Yeah, but he was fighting back. You know. Like, what...what... what was he supposed to do? Until we put the... ..put the cuffs on him and... (SIGHS) Look, she just kept... ..laying into him. Just fucking boom, boom on, his... ..up on his shoulders and... ..like, the back of his head. He just dropped, like... He was crying. I just stood there. I didn't do shit. (SIGHS) You just do what's right. You know if I say something, though, that, um... ..like, all this is...that's... (WATER SPLASHES) ..that's it, right? And you're back to Homebrand Coco Pops. Put enough milk on them, they taste alright. (BOYS CHATTER) Alright, boys. Bath time. Come on. Out you pop. Come here. BOY: Ohh, oh! Alright, here we go. Just...just three more dives, please. MAN: (ON RADIO) Mick Dooley. The Manic Mechanic. He'll get you back on the road. 42 Stirling Street, Port Augusta. (WOMAN SINGS SOFTLY) (LAUGHTER AND CHATTER) (WOMAN CONTINUES SINGING) (CHILD SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) WOMAN: Oh, wow! (LAUGHS) (WOMAN CONTINUES SINGING) (INDISTINCT VOICE ON TWO-WAY RADIO) Why can't you write about this? Good-news stories. Families in community housing, supported by the Government. The Government that locks their husbands and fathers up, tying them to Barton? The Government that keeps them under guard in community detention? The Government that feeds them and their children, and pays for their medical treatment. I will find your source. Probably. (CONTINUES SINGING) Farid sent me. I'm a chemist. This is the closest he could find. Do you know what he's taking? One in the morning, one in the night. We should get him up, get him walking. Ameer. Pedar. Come on, my friend. Come on. Let's go for a walk. Come on. (GROANS) I just want to sleep. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON TWO-WAY RADIO) FARID: Beautiful! Sister, how are you today? Wow! You look beautiful. Come here. HARRIET: Out for a constitutional, are we? MAN: Mm-hm. Clock just struck 12, Cinderella. Time to go back to the men's. Try to keep him awake. (GAGS) It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. (AMEER GROANS) (TAPS KEYS) Oh... (CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER AND INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES) This food... ..does it come from outside? No - I slaughtered this chicken myself and hand-picked every grain of rice. Where do you think it comes from? (INDISTINCT VOICE ON TWO-WAY RADIO) Uh-uh. No food to be taken out of the mess. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You want to run that by me again, mate, in English? Mr Cam? Come on. Can I speak to you now in private, please? Not now, mate. Sorry. It won't take long. I'm not supposed to step away, so... Just one minute, please. One minute. OK. Thanks. Yep. Thank you. Uh, mate. Uh-uh. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Turn around. Sit down. Eat. Alright? It's... My lawyer is a donkey. I need a new one. Can you please give my name to someone outside? No, I can't do anything like that. Alright? Sorry. I can't help you. Please. I only have a few more days to lodge my appeal. I can't be sent back. (SIGHS) My brother will have me killed. Look, it was a misunderstanding. My neighbour, Mr Halabi, we spent a lot of time together, but we were friends, that's all. My brother says I brought shame to the family. I need to stay here. Mate, I need you to turn around and sit down, eat, alright? (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) You're not taking it out, mate. You're not taking it out. Oh! (SHOUTING) Get down! Get down! Take him away! Take him to isolation. Arggh! Hey! You are on duty, Officer! You want to get your cock sucked by Mohammed, do it on your own time. Come with me, sweetie. (SHOUTING AND CHANTING) MAN: (ON RADIO) Sierra 3... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) Get back inside before he sees you or I will report you. I've been watching you. Stop watching me, OK? Stop watching me and stop following me. OK? I'm warning you. For your own good, you turn away. (CRYING) (GASPS) (CRYING CONTINUES) Mina? Mina-jan? No! (DOOR OPENS) (BRIAN SIGHS) Righto, Cam. Tell me what happened. Yeah. Uh, well, we were, um... ..we were taking the...the UNC from, uh...from Tango Compound. Um... ..and he was...he was, uh... he was struggling quite a bit. He was, uh, resisting. Um... ..I got hit just here. And, uh... ..well, so, the decision was made to, uh...to restrain him. Um... Go on. And, uh... ..and we cuffed him. And then, uh... ..and Officer Tawake, uh, instructed us to... ..take him round the side of the building, out of the view of the security cameras, and we held him while she beat him. (SIGHS) Yeah, it wasn't, uh... ..it wasn't reasonable force. We...we... ..yeah, we bashed him. (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) Empty your pockets. Phones and computers should already be in the locker. Come through, come through. Need to empty your pockets, guys. Put all your personal items in the trays. If you've got a, uh, mobile phone or a computer, should already be in a locker. You hiding out? Sorry... What do you want? I have to sack three of my best... ..uh, correction, formerly best, officers. So, the UNC was telling the truth. Yeah. (SCOFFS) It's gonna take six weeks to train their replacements. (LAUGHS) Well... ..I'd better get that happening. I'll take that. It's just a chicken, Cameron. Well, what can we offer them but a moment of connection, a meal to share, to let them know they're not alone? Let them have that. MAN: Empty your pockets, please. Empty your bags. Place everything on the belt, please. Phones and computers should already be in the locker. Keep moving, please. Just make your way through the scanner, please. Phones and computers should be in the locker. CLARE: Wait a minute! I'll take this. Keep moving, thank you. Break it open. You can tell David Meakin he's lost his source. She's banned until further notice. Who's she visiting? Can I smoke? CLARE: No. I know it was you who took the photographs for David Meakin. Sister Bernadette has visited you several times, including the day before the photograph was published. Sister Bernadette brings me succour. Well, she brings you a lot more than that. And you're not Catholic. Compassion wears many cloaks. This message... (PHONE BEEPS) Psalm 144, verse one. "Training hands for war, fingers for battle". Hmm. What's that mean? She's reminding me to stay strong. My battle is up here. To hold on to who I am - Javad. Not an unlawful non-citizen, not PEL-139, but Javad. We can hold you in isolation. You'll have no contact with the outside world. No contact with journalists, advocates. No contact with your family. If you tell me what the mobile is for... ..and what you're planning... OK, then. No, wait, wait, wait, wait. I will tell you. But only if I stay out with the others. You promise to me. Promise me no isolation. I do. (SIGHS) There is a protest. On Sunday. People from outside, the advocates, they will be calling for compassion. We will be on the inside. Who is 'we'? The men in my compound. And what will you be doing? Let me just say, there is much for your newspapers to write about. Those photographs, they're just the beginning. Take him to isolation. Wait. What? No. You just said I could stay out. I'm just... Arggh! I'm talking to her! You said I could stay out. You promised me! Yes?! Yes, you promised me I would stay! You lied! You lied to me. (DOOR OPENS) (JAVAD SHOUTS) (INDISTINCT VOICE ON TWO-WAY RADIO) (SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Aaagh! Clare! Ugh! Get up! Get up! No! No! No! (CONTINUES SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CLARE: It's this Sunday, and I want every available officer on duty. BRIAN: (ON PHONE) We're three down, remember? Well, your report says only one was actively involved. Do you have to sack all three of them? It was a breach of conduct, so, yes, I do. Right. I can override you. Are you going to? (SCOFFS) (PHONE BEEPS) DAVID: You put Javad Shahrokh in isolation? Yes, I did. He was smuggling out a memory card and organising a riot. So he can't communicate his plight, and he can't complain about it. We are still in a democracy, aren't we, or did I miss something? The department has a responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of everyone in Barton. Seriously? What happened to you, Clare? (DRUMMING) (CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) AMEER: I have been selfish. I am so sorry for that. I should have been on that boat with you. I was trying to keep you all safe. I can see your mother in your face. And your sister. Hey. I want to see them, Mina. You honour them both with your courage and your strength. I miss them. I do too. But they would want us to keep going. To finish what we all started. To live the best lives we can in our new home. (KISSES) (RHYTHMIC CLAPPING) (UNSETTLING SOUNDSCAPE) SOFIE: Pat! Pat? Pat! (TAPS FRAME) Pat, it's Sofie. Please, I would really like to come back. PAT: No. Pat! No, no, no. Oh, Pat, but I know I can do better. No, Sofie, it's over. Please, but I know I can do better. I know I can do better. Please. I can do so much better. Please? (UNLOCKS DOOR) Sofie, darling. I know you love it here, as I do. You know, I've given my heart and my soul to GOPA. It's my life's work. But how can I let you in, with your dirty, negative energy? It's like a virus. Now, if I let you in, everyone could be infected with your inadequacy and your deformity. I'm not gonna let you destroy our way of life. You need to go home. But this is my home. No. This is my home. Please! No! But I know I can do better. I know! But I can do better! No! It's OUR home. Sofie! You're not welcome here! (SOBS) (SOBS) WOMAN: Don't cry. It's OK. When you gonna tell her? (INHALES AND SIGHS) I will. I'm just... ..letting her enjoy it while she can. I'm proud of you, Bear. Yeah? ANGIE: Hey, come in! It's beautiful. Yeah, why not? Is it still really painful? There's no real damage. Tear ducts are blocked, but I'll be alright. Name? Mosi Koroma. Mosi... Boat ID? LOR-098. OK. Well, um... ..you know, I just want to say that I-I...I'm really sorry. I feel terrible about it. It's fine. (LAUGHS) Crying never did me much good anyway. (LAUGHS) Name? HARRIET: Sandford? Uh, name? Um, Mustafa. Just spoke to the boss. Cleared of any wrongdoing. What? I was so sure you were gonna choke. Beers on me tonight! Not you guys, though. You have to brew your own. Hey, it's good, isn't it? Means you get to stay. MINA: 'Ker-fuff-le'. 'Kerfuffle'. Meaning a commo... ..commotion. Yes. (LAUGHS) Or a fuss. Very good. Your English is very good now, Mina. I went to school, Pedar. Tell me about the family you stayed with. Were they good to you? They had a yellow car. Mm. And a little cat, called Jasper. (LAUGHS) FARID: Ya, Ameer! Look who is here! The third amigo! (LAUGHS) Huh? MINA: Hey. We know that man. Don't we, Pedar? (LAUGHS) (BOTH PANT) No! Uh, no, no. Uh, I don't think so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. From the... Mina, come inside. (DOOR CLOSES) I've ordered a lockdown of Tango Compound, and we'll have every hand on deck. Well, I'm impressed, Clare. Taken to the job like a duck to water. Oh... Uncovered a protest. Plugged a leak. What about the officers involved? Reasonable and proportionate force. You should buy a lottery ticket. You're on a winning streak. I should. We need to talk containment. We're gonna need back-up. I want enough local police to cover the outside of the front fence. We need to send a strong message to the protesters not to try anything stupid. CLARE: The detainees need to know we're in control. We're the ringmasters here. I know what you're planning. And I'm coming with you. CLARE: Today's protest will be of a large scale. Well, I'm terrified. (WHISTLES) Freedom! (YELLS) Code green, Sierra Compound! GORDON: If I were you, I would run far, far away, 'cause if I ever lay eyes on you again, I'll destroy you. We only have one chance at this, Mina, and we must do everything possible to succeed. Australia does not recognise church sanctuary. I didn't want to put you in a difficult position. What the fuck am I in now?! Margot? She's alive!
