 (PROTESTERS SHOUT) GENEVIEVE: You were so focused on a bunch of nuns, you didn't realise a prison break was happening in your own backyard! CAM: Code Green, Sierra Compound! You right? Get in! I'll text you directions to a safe house. Please go. I'd never risk myself, my chance at a visa. What about you? WOMAN: Do you think you have won now? No, but I think you've lost any chance of getting a visa. If I ever lay eyes on you again, I'll destroy you. Sofe, is that you? Margot?

 CAM: I saw your car driving to pick 'em up. Get out! CAM: Hey, uh, Brian? I know where they are. No, please, man! Javad! (JAVAD YELLS) No! HARRIET: Welcome to isolation. Well played, Sandford. You're a real Sherlock Holmes. Sleep tight. (DOOR CLOSES) (BLEEPING AND WHIRRING) (BEEPING) Uh, April 6, 4:19am. Removal of ROP-003. Present, DIMMA caseworker Okoh,

 officers Sullivan, Sandford, myself, Tawake. Officer Burton filming. (DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE) (UNLOCKS AND OPENS DOOR) Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey, you gotta wake up, mate. OK? Hi, Mr Cam. Hey. Wake up now. OKOH: Kasim Al Alwani, following refusal of your application for a protection visa, you're being removed under... No! ..section 198 of the Migration Act. No, no! Please, no! Please! This isn't right. This isn't right! You'll be taken to the airport... I have more time! ..be met with security officers... You can't do this! ..who will escort you to Baghdad. My lawyer is speaking to the Minister. They will let me stay. They will let me stay. Please! Please! You need to put some pants on. They will let me stay. Please! So you need to put some pants on. No! Please! No! Get dressed. Come on, mate. Please. Please. That's it. You know my story, Mr Cam. I can't go back! You need to get dressed. We're gonna have to get outside. Please, Mr Cam, please! Come on. Please! Please. No! Let go of me! Let go of me! (YELLS INDISTINCTLY) (CONTINUES YELLING) Help me, my brothers! (PANTS) Please! Help me! Mina? Help! Help me! Help me, someone! Get up. Please, Mr Cam, no! (SHOUTS FRANTICALLY) Farid! (MEN SHOUT IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES) MAN: I will pray for you, brother! (SHOUTS FRANTICALLY) CLARE: Our response needs to be swift and sharp. Until the review of our protocols is complete, we will be introducing a series of measures to ensure Barton's security. Brian? Righto. All visits will be suspended. Now, this includes lawyers and advocates. The public phones will be locked. There will be no contact with the outside. The kitchen remains closed until further notice. Packaged meals only. And a barrier will be set up between Sierra and Tango Compound to block any further collusion between the UNCs. Now, I'm gonna need a show of hands from the night crew to put up the barrier. Hour's overtime. Suck it up, boys and girls. Thank you. Dismissed. I want to say... ..how much the department appreciates the hard work that you do. You are at the front line of this country's... ..world-class border protection program, and the department appreciates your work very much. Ooh! (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) CLARE: Did I miss a memo? Flying visit. Brian. You've, uh, come to experience the enduring aroma of a shitstorm? I've come to give you both a heads-up, actually. Human Rights Commission will be here next week for a tour of the place. Ohh! They'll take any pretext for moral outrage, so the place had better be sparkling. (SIGHS) You could have phoned with that information. Just dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Now, can you point me in the direction of the coffee machine, 'cause I'm getting the shakes. It's just...there. Oh. Oh. (DOOR OPENS) Hello, Ameer. My name is Fiona Okoh. I'm your DIMMA case officer. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I...I don't need a translator. My English is good. It's very nice to meet you, Ms Okoh. (RECORDER CLICKS) I need to advise you that this interview will be recorded. The recording is to help us make an accurate decision and will not be given to anyone in your home country. I understand. Ameer. I read your file and the history you provided to the case officer on Christmas Island. Yes. I do have some more questions for you in relation to your claim for asylum. Yes. And these questions relate to the time after your family left on a boat for Australia. Of course. It's very unusual for the male in a family to send his wife ahead. Most often, the male goes first and then the wife and children follow. Can you explain this? Uh, I did not have enough money for us all. So you stayed behind to earn more money? No. I just waited. So how did you pay for your passage to Australia? (MAN SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) I understand the question. Uh, my brother-in-law, Nasim, he sent money from Afghanistan. And you have proof of this? I... ..I...I don't. A receipt? A bank statement? How was this money transferred? (SHOUTING) I... ..I...I don't remember. Ameer. Part of this process is a character assessment. It is very important that you tell me the truth. Uh...well, the...the money, my brother-in-law, he...he posted it. Uh, it was cash. (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON LOUDSPEAKER) (DOOR OPENS) Well. Huh? Very well. I told you. We do the right thing and soon we'll be gone from here. (WATER RUNS) GORDON: There. What was that? SOFIE: Nothing. I feel really good. Sofie, you know you can't hide here. (TURNS OFF WATER) (BEEPING) GORDON: Are you ready? (BEEPING CONTINUES) Please! Please, I need to get out of here, please! Please, can you hear me? Please! Please! Please? Please! Please? Please help me. (ANNOUNCEMENT ALERT CHIMES) BRIAN: (ON LOUDSPEAKER) Unlawful non-citizens are not to interfere with KORVO officers. The barrier is being erected between the single men and the families because of the escape attempt. Please don't do this to us! Don't do that! All phone, visitor and meal privileges are also suspended until further notice. (SHOUTING) Can't hear ya! Can't hear ya! What? Nah, can't hear ya. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Farid! Farid! (WHISTLING) I'm in trouble, Farid. I must speak to a lawyer. No visits. No phone calls. MAN: Don't do that! I-I did something. I just wanted my money back. That's all. I was desperate. My daughter was sick. It made sense - steal from the man who stole from us. (PANTS) Stop! (GROANS) No! But it all went wrong. Run! Run! Run! (SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (PANTS) This is a crime! If they find out, they will never give you a visa. Case officer has asked me to come for another interview. Think she has information. Hm. You can't say anything. Whatever they ask you, say nothing. As soon as you can, find a lawyer. CAM: Oi! May God protect you, brother. Look at that! Should have brought my aunty's glue gun, put some glitter on it. Hm? Hey, Solomon. How are ya, mate? Huh? Gonna give me five? Nup? Alright. WOMAN: Do not talk to him! HARRIET: OK. Overtime's done. Beer o'clock. Buying you a beer, Sandford. It weren't for you, we'd still be combing the desert looking for those arseholes. (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) (SIGHS) (COUGHS) You right? JANICE: Yeah, one of the sisters bailed me out. Um... ..that's good. I just...I just wanted to stop by and make sure that, you know... ..you're alright, so... ..yeah. Why did you do it? What was... ..what was I supposed to do, you know? What chance did they have on the run, huh? Look, if they'd just waited. Alright? All they had to do was wait... Oh, they did. ..and do the right thing. The one thing...they did the only thing that they could do. That department, they ripped a dad from his kids for fighting back against the system, and that escape, that was the one chance that they had to be a family. You took that from them! Oh, that's... (SNIFFS) I ca... (SNIFFS) Hey! Nah. (DOOR CLOSES) So the majority of guards were stationed at the entrance or in Tango Compound, even though it had been locked down? You know, I got every single one of those escapees back. I've doubled the caseworkers on UNCs' applications. I have hosed down every crisis. I sent you out here to get us off the front pages. Now...now we're on ABC, BBC, NBC, all the fuckin' Cs. Why don't you just come out and say it? You're here to sack me. I know how the department works. Something goes wrong, someone has to pay. Do I get my old job back? Jesus Christ! Well, nothing's been decided until after the investigation is complete. You talked me into this position. I wanted to stay in Policy. Yeah, you can't... And now you're pushing me under the bus? You can't write good policy unless you have lived experience. That's bullshit! I wrote excellent policy. I've given everything to this department, for the past 20 years, everything. Do you know where I was when my mother was dying? In the office, working on stop the fucking boats! Well, I think you got a promotion out of it, if I remember rightly. Yeah, and I lost my marriage. (CLEARS THROAT) It's TOR-076. The man whose wife and daughter died. I know who he is. I know I said it looked straightforward, but, uh, something's come up. Serious discrepancies with his story. (SIGHS) They've all got sad stories, Kowitz. His might make him unfortunate, but it doesn't make him genuine. I know that. (REPEATED BANGING NOISE IN DISTANCE) I'll get the Federal Police to look into it. Line up another interview. I want to speak to the UNC directly. (REPEATED BANGING NOISE IN DISTANCE) What the fuck IS that? (SHOUTING) (SOBBING) (FENCE RATTLES) Get back! Get back! Hey! Hey! Get back! Back up! Everyone go back to their rooms! (CHANTING AND SHOUTING) Hey. You want a riot on your hands? No, TUL-778, I don't. OK. Well, you talk to me, I talk to them and we can make this stop. Nobody should be fed this. It is for animals. What is going on? They are angry. They don't know why... why they are being punished when they weren't the ones who escaped. They won't stop until the kitchen is reopened and their phone privileges have been reinstated. TUL-7... Farid. ..Farid... ..is offering to negotiate for them. We're not negotiating with you. Sending the wrong message. Well, what do you think we should do? Double your officers in here. Contain the situation. They'll get sick of it eventually. (ANNOUNCEMENT ALERT CHIMES) (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON LOUDSPEAKER) She...she doesn't know what we are capable of. You cannot put a lid over a pot that's already boiling over. (DOOR CLOSES) (SHOUTING) (PHONE RINGS) (SIGHS) (BABY FUSSES) Sandford. HARRIET: Sandford, I'm calling you back in. What? We've got a situation here. Hey? Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... They're going psycho in the men's compound. (BABY CRIES) Hey? (CLEARS THROAT) I need you... Just hang on a sec. I can't... ..to do another shift right now! Yeah. Um... (BABY CRIES) Well, what about... what about the turnaround? Hey. Shooshie, please. Hey. Yeah, just, um... Um...ah, fuck. Yeah, I just need... my missus isn't home yet, so... Here she is now. Hey, can you take her, please? Take her. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Alright. Hang on. Hang on. Take her. Alright, um... I'll see you in a minute. ANGIE: Come on. Fuck me. I gotta go back in. What? You just did 12 hours. Oh, some bullshit. They need backup. So... Yeah, but does it have to be you? Obviously, it has to be me, yeah, 'cause I'm going back in. Oh! It's alright. Fuckin' time and a half. Should see you just fine. What does that mean? Means what it means. Why are you mad at ME? I'm not mad at you. Well, that's bullshit. Why are you acting like you give a fuck all of a sudden? Huh? A bit tough on you, is it? You're fuckin' stoked I didn't get the sack. Don't have to move again. Yeah? Make the big bucks, eh? Go get your nails done. (CLATTERING) Fuck you, Cameron! Fuck! (BABY CRIES) (CHANTING) The situation's escalating. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) BRIAN: We have to shut this down now. TUL-778 said they were at boiling point and they're not gonna stop. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Getting some deja-bloody-vu here. (THUD!) Fuck you! Come on! Fuck. Fuck you! They're treating us like dogs! Come on! Fuck! Come on! Batons out! Fight me! Fucking come on! Fight me! Watch your backs! Come on! Fight me! Ah! Come on! HARRIET: You will move back now! Come fight me! (CHANTING AND SHOUTING) MAN: Fuck you! HARRIET: Move back! The department need to clarify some inconsistencies that have come to light in reviewing your application for a protection visa. You told your case officer, Ms Okoh... ..that you paid for your family's boat passage with money you brought from Afghanistan. Right? Yes. And that you had to wait for your brother-in-law, Ahmad Nasim, to send more money so that you could get another boat. Is that correct? Yes. Yes, it is. This is the death certificate of your brother-in-law, Ahmad Nasim. Look at the date. He died months before you claim that he sent you money. Ameer. I know you have suffered. But if you want any chance of getting protection for yourself and your daughter, you have to tell me the truth. How did you pay for your passage to Australia? I'd like to speak to a lawyer, please. CLARE: Oh, his daughter, in her first interview, mentioned a hotel the family stayed at - Excelsior. Yes. E...E-X-C... (KNOCK AT DOOR) Just...let me know if you find anything. BRIAN: Hear that? (SILENCE) Oh, I told you they'd stop. I've reopened the mess. And, if they behave themselves, I will let them use the telephones. You...you've done a deal with them? After I expressly said no negotiation? I had to look out for the wellbeing of my officers. The situation was escalating. GENEVIEVE: You made the right call. Safety has to come first. I want the ringleaders put in isolation. Isolation is full. Well, then, empty it. GORDON: Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. What is it that you want? (BEEPING) I want to be loved. You want love? (SOFIE BREATHES SHAKILY) You have to allow yourself... ..to be totally vulnerable. (SIGHS) (SOBS) (SOFIE BREATHES SHAKILY) Time to let go. DYSON: Time to go. (PANTS) (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Heading back to the compound. Special circumstances. Really? (BEEPING) (DOOR UNLOCKS) (CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) Happy to see you! Hello, Eva! Hello, Eva! Oh, thank you so much! Thank you. You saved me. Oh, you're welcome. (SNIFFS) (SIGHS) (PANTS) (CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) Thanks. It's been a privilege. (LAUGHS) Great. Thank you. I look forward to seeing you next time. Yeah. Absolutely. (LAUGHS) We've all made sacrifices, Kowitz. Right. You undermined me in front of the assistant secretary. I was trying to solve a problem. By going behind my back. What did you tell her about the escape? Did...did you tell her that it was... ..it was my idea to stack the guards at the front fence? Did you tell her that our security was substandard? That's what she insinuated to me. Well, if your guards had been paying attention, if you had overseen it... Alright. Can...can we just, like, speed this up a little bit? Because I've got an antsy and overtired crew out there. Why don't I just help ya? "Brian, why don't you just solve that problem?" "Brian, you're solving it the wrong way." "Brian, why isn't it solved?" "Brian, you're a moron." I just...I think there's better ways of doing... You be my guest! You...you see how you go feeding detainees on four bucks a day. Or try to stop 'em from hurting each other, or themselves, when they're jammed in here like fucking battery hens with fuck-all to do but hassle me 24/7. You're not the only one that's under pressure here. What about you try to stick to a schedule when you've got a cap on staffing, but the numbers keep increasing 'cause they're shutting down all the other centres? Your company is paid exceptionally well to do this job. Not to mention backlog from your fly-in-fly-out caseworkers operating on latte time. Your contractors... ..leaves this place unless they're dragged out... ..no responsibility. ..kicking and screaming. "Give us the money." You all sit up, you know, in your ivory towers while we're down here on the shopfront working it out! It's your job! Just do it! You... (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) This place... ..it can mess with ya. It messed with Katia, big-time. I'm not Katia. I'm gonna survive this. Inshallah. (DOOR SLAMS) (ANNOUNCEMENT ALERT CHIMES) (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON LOUDSPEAKER) (SOFIE SIGHS) Never a dull moment. Do you see? It's a... it's a plane...up in the sky. CHILD: Yes. I see it. CHILD 2: I see it. I see it! CAM: I don't think she's all there. What do you reckon? Should we book her a psych appointment? Oh, knock yourself out. Telling you, it's just an act. They pretend they're a brick short of a full load so they can transfer themselves out of here on medical grounds. We were flying on the plane once and flying over the mountains and... ..the mountains were covered in snow. And the snow was sparkling and it looked like they were covered in diamonds. CHILD: Look! There! CHILD 2: I made a diamond. OK. Didn't feel like I was on a plane anymore. It felt like... ..I was flying. Like I was some incredible bird, flying - I was flying. HARRIET: OK, princess. Playtime's over. Back to your room. But I'm just lying here. Please, you can't make me. Oh, can't I? Take her back inside. Not a request. (INDISTINCT VOICE ON RADIO) Come on! Come on. KIDS: Don't make her! Away you go. Why, Mr Cam? I want to stay out here, please. Really? I just want to stay out... ..here, please. Come on! Put your back into it! You could help, you know. I just...I just want to stay out here... Come on. ..in the fresh air. I just want to stay out here in the fresh air. Please. Eva, come back. I want to stay out here. I want to stay out here! I'm supposed to go home to Germany. I...I told the police that. My name is Eva Hoffman. Please, I told the police. You will once the embassy can confirm your story. Until then, you need to come with us. No! I don't want to go! Don't you fucking touch me! SOFIE: I want to stay out here. CAM: Ow! I want to stay out here, please. Let go. I want to stay! Get off! Get off! I want to... Please! Back off. I don't...I want to stay out here. I don't want to go back in. I want to stay out here in the fresh air. Please, please, please, please, please. I don't want to go! I don't... (PANTS) (INAUDIBLE) Federal Police. WOMAN: Yes. (DOOR OPENS) MARGOT: When was this? (DOOR CLOSES) MAN: About three months ago. I...I only just found out she was missing. Do you think it was her on that flight? (SIGHS) I don't know. And this... ..this woman was handcuffed. I...I can locate the flight by checking my shifts. Maybe check the manifest. On the quiet. I'd appreciate that. You said you... you flew out of Hervey Bay. Where...where were you going? Here. Sofie's here? If it was her. I don't belong here. I was supposed to be sent to Germany. I should be there now. Can you help me get out? MAN: I might be able to, yes. Really? Really. But I need you to answer a few questions first. (SNIFFS) Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental illness? No. I'm perfectly fine. Ever had a head trauma? No. You ever been hospitalised or prescribed medication? I don't understand why you're asking me these questions. (CLEARS THROAT) You think this process is easy? No. Have you ever had thoughts about hurting yourself? No. What about physical sensations, feelings when there's nothing there? Can we please stop? Stop? No, Sofie. There's no end point. I work on myself every single day of my life. Do you hear things? No. See things? I...I really... Shh, shh, shh. ..would like to just stop. You've got to let yourself go. You said I... ..didn't have to be the person that everyone wants me to be. It takes real courage to allow yourself to be vulnerable with someone else. I'm trying. Try again. Please, I don't... No, don't. Don't! No, no, don't! (SNIFFS) No! Don't! Don't...? Don't what? Would you like to discontinue? Yes. Yes. OK, then. It's OK. We can stop. Thank you for coming to talk to me today. Will I still be able to get out? I think you will. (SNIFFS) I'll need a passport. Is that something you will be able to organise for me? I'll see what I can do. OSHAN: (ON RECORDING) You must be ready to leave at any time. If you talk to anybody outside of this room, you will not be on a boat. If you cause any problem on the boat, it turns round, comes straight back here. (BREATHES SHAKILY) No money back. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (KNOCK ON DOOR) (PAUSES RECORDING) I was told to bring this to you. Transfer to Kildara Psychiatric Hospital. Oh, uh, can't the caseworker handle it? He doesn't fly in till Friday. I don't think this one can wait. I'll take care of it. Thanks. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Where is my lawyer? CLARE: I just want you to look at something. Do you recognise this man? This is Oshan Nissanka. He's one of the region's most notorious people smugglers. So you've never met him? We have a witness who saw you take money. Who is this witness? Just tell us. Tell us about Oshan. Tell us what you did. Please. Please, don't do this. My daughter, she deserves to have a decent life, to be free, as you are. That's all we want. It will be better for you if you confess. I do not know this man. I am a schoolteacher. I am a father, a man of faith. Why can't you see all of that when you look at me? Why must you dig in every corner for specks of dirt? (BOTH LAUGH) You told them! Mosi! You son of a dog! (SHOUTING AND SCREAMING) I said nothing! Pedar! Well, here we go again. Hey! BURTON: Sierra 3, we need backup in the mess. Over. CAM: Come on! FARID: Stop, Ameer! You told them! It wasn't me! Why would I do this? Huh?! Why? To save yourself! Backup in the mess. Over! Pedar! You betrayed... Hold still. MINA: Please! (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Please! AMEER: Mosi! Mosi! TEDDY: Up we go. You betrayed me, Mosi! I thought you were my friend! I thought you were my friend! You betrayed me! TEDDY: Take him to isolation. Mina! (ANNOUNCEMENT ALERT CHIMES) (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON LOUDSPEAKER) Look, you can't sleep out here. You gotta go back in eventually. I just need to get my things. The doctor said that I would be leaving soon. OK, well... ..just, can you go in, thanks? It's alright. Just go on in. You're fine. GORDON: It's OK. You're still holding on. Come on. Let go. Let go. (SOFIE PANTS) I told you... ..I told you I don't want to keep going. Uh...I don't want to be doing this. GORDON: It's OK. Can you feel that? Feel that? That's good. Keep going. I really just want to stop. Please! Shh. Shh! I don't want to keep going. I told you. Now let yourself go. I would prefer to stop now, please. Just... Why do you keep going? You're revolting! Get off of me! Stop it! Stop! Stop it! Help! No, no! Help! You need to get away! Help! Help! She's attacking me! Someone help! I need backup! Help! I told you I don't want to keep... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! ..I don't want to keep going! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get off me! What happened? I don't know. She just went nuts. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down! No, I told you... Calm down! Call the medic now! ..I don't want to keep going! I trusted you! Calm the fuck down! Arggh! GORDON: Lay yourself bare. CAM: Calm the fuck down! BURTON: Medic, Sierra 12! Arggh! Back to your rooms, everyone. Back to your rooms. Hey! Hey, calm down! Alright? I want it to stop! Where's that medic? Medic now, Sierra 12. (SHOUTING) Where's the medic? Stop it! Get off me! Get off me! Where's the medic? Calm down! Alright? Stop! I don't want it! Stop it! Hey! I don't want... (SCREAMS) Calm down! Stop it, alright? Doesn't concern you. Turn around. Go back to your rooms. (SOBS) Get off of me! BURTON: Back! Get back, guys! I'm not gonna ask you again. Back, back. (SHOUTING) (SNIFFS) (PANTS) Hey. Hey. Come for a drink? Wash this shitty day away. I think I should probably go home. OK. (ZIPS BAG) (BOYS CHATTER) ANGIE: I don't care what your brother does. Hop down. Ah! Hop down, OK? I've had enough. No, listen to your mummy and hop off the couch, please. Thank you! Hey! (BOYS CHANT) Boys! Off the couch, please. BOY: No way! (BOYS BLOW RASPBERRIES) ANGIE: Hi. She's been vomiting, all day. Mostly on me. I'm having a shower. Here. Oh! OK. (BOYS ARGUE) Boys. Hey. Come on. Settle down. Hey! What did Mum say? You gonna pick up these toys? BOYS: No! Hey. I need you to help me, alright? Pick these toys up, alright? Sit down and watch some TV. No! Hey! Enough of that, alright? Get down. I want you to watch some telly. I'm gonna get you! (BOYS YELL) Here you go. (SIGHS) Go in there. BOY: Get off me now! Here you go. You right? Daddy! Come here. Put your legs in here. Here you go. (BOYS YELL AND SCREAM) Oi! Oi! BOY: Let go! Ow! What did I say? I'm not doing anything! What did I just say? You're hurting me! Huh? He's hurting me! Charlie! Stop it. Hey! Sammy! Char... Let... You, get up. No. Timeout! Let go of me! (BOYS SCREAM) Timeout! Get in timeout now! Get over there! (BOYS YELL AND SCREAM) Come here. Come here. Mum! Mum! Mum! Stop it! Stop that now! When I say, you stop, alright?! Mum! Dad's hurting me! Jesus, Cam, what are you doing? Mummy! Mum! Mum! Mum! Hey! Mummy! What the hell?! Mum! (CRIES) Ow! Mum, that hurts. CAM: Ange... Go! Ange... Who are you?! Get out! You just get out! Leave! (PANTS) Daddy hurt me. Are you OK? (PICKS UP KEYS) Are you hurt? (BOYS CRY) Ameer Ahmad. He stay in my hotel. He work for... ..Oshan Nissanka's immigration business. GENEVIEVE: Where'd you get this? ..Farsi language, very good. CLARE: It just came in. The AFP interviewed the hotel receptionist, the one who shot the video. He recognised Ameer straightaway, was happy to make a statement. The receptionist filmed everything. Some kind of insurance, I guess. You just caught yourself a people smuggler, Kowitz. Well, he...he worked for a people smuggler. Well, he's taking money. Under the act, he's a people smuggler. What's gonna happen to him? Depends how he pleads. If it goes to trial and he loses, well, it's... ..deportation, indefinite detention, prison, variations on that theme. What about his daughter? You followed your instinct. You looked into it and you struck gold. Go home. Celebrate. Not too hard, though. You've got to be back on deck tomorrow. (ENDS CALL) (CHATTER) (KNOCKS) Come in. I thought... ..peace offering? Thanks, but, uh... (OBJECT CLATTERS) Department found "serious breaches in KORVO's management plan" led to the escape. I'm sorry. Well... ..had to find someone to blame. Brian, this...this shouldn't have... I-I didn't want this. It's OK. I got a teenager that I don't know how to talk to anymore. It'd be good to spend some more time with him. If his mum lets me.

"You can be anyone you want to be." I'm on my way to Barton to find out for myself. If there is an Australian citizen in Barton, it'll bring a shitstorm that'll destroy this department.
