 [whimpering] [whine] That's it. No more liver for you. Well, I don't see anything, Courage. Ooh! Aah! Put me down! Put me down! Oh, you-you thing, you! Muriel! MURIEL: Aah! Courage! Help! Oh! You filthy, dirty thing, you! What are you doing to me? Aah! Take that thing off me! Aah! Wouldn't you prefer tea instead? Ohhh! Huh? Make me! Courage! Get help! Oh! Ow! Oh! Aah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, thank goodness. [snore] [door slams] Huh? Wha? Wha? Wha? Huh? Eh? Aah! [whimper] [whine] Get away from me! Stupid dog. [whack] EUSTACE: Oww! You rotten dog! [arf arf arf] Come back here! I'll strangle you! Yaaah! [crash] Who the heck are you? MURIEL: Oh! Oh! Oooh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Oof! EUSTACE: Hey! What are you going to do with that thing? Hey! Ow! Get this thing off me! Aah! Who do you think you are? Oooh! Eee! No, you don't! Uhh! Aah! Ow! Yeah! Yeow! [Splash] Ahh... [sigh] Muriel, Muriel! Wake up, wake up! [snore] Ooh! Uhh! Oh! [Pant pant] [grunt] Ooh! Oh, what a terrible dream. I think I'll have a cup of tea. The things I do for love! Oh, lovely. [whimper] Aah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! It's awful windy tonight. Hold on, Muriel! Here I come! Ooh! [grunt] Ow! Aaaah! Ow! Uhh! Ow! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Uhh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Aaaaah! [crash] Yay! [engine starts] Aah! Aah! [gibberish] Aah! [tires screech] [crash] Uhh... Muriel? Fancy some tea, Courage? Oh, no. [whimper] [alarm] Oooh! Stupid dog. Lovely fireworks, eh, Courage? Oh, there's Eustace with my slipper! Aah! This still shouldn't happen to a dog. Ow! [grunting] You can stop pumping, Courage. The well's gone dry. Eustace! What? The well is dry. I want you to get to work right away and dig us a new one. Oh... Bah! You heard her, dog--dig! This drought is just awful. I hope we find water soon. I don't want anything to happen to you, not until you're ripe and plump and juicy. Then I'll pluck you, slice you, and fry you up. Eustace, wait till you taste my eggplant surprise. I don't eat eggplants. You'll eat this eggplant and love it. It will be cooked and steamed until it's tasty and tender. And after it's cooked, it will be covered with my sweet seasonings. ALL: Ohhh... This is our sworn enemy, the enemy of all eggplants! And we shall destroy her! All hail our leader! All hail Babighanoush! [cheering] [cheering] We shall invade the above world and attack the one called Muriel! Attack Muriel! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, no! [humming] [whimper] [roar] You're trying to tell me something about the eggplant, aren't you? Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! I know what you're trying to tell me. [sigh] And the answer is yes. Huh? Of course you can have some of the eggplant, Courage. No! Don't worry, there will be enough for everyone. You loafing dog! Didn't I tell you to dig? Stupid dog! Aah! Aah! Babi, when do we attack? Yeah, Babi, when? Patience, Ratatouille. We shall attack when the great eggplant comes to lead the way! It's the great eggplant! It's him! It's him! The great eggplant! [burp] My friends, the great eggplant has arrived! The time has come for the great eggplant to lead us to the surface to destroy Muriel! [gasp] [cheers] [whimper] The great eggplant really thinks you guys need some more training before you go up there. [cheering] The great eggplant has spoken! Train us, oh, Peppy one. All right. Do as the great eggplant does. The great eggplant says, run in place. The great eggplant says, do this! The great eggplant says, do this! Woo woo woo woo woo! Woo woo woo woo! Now do this! You didn't say, "The great eggplant says." Wow. That's a pretty sharp bunch of eggplants. I think we have demonstrated our physical condition to the great eggplant. Well, sir? Are you ready to lead the attack? Um, I am. But fellow eggplants, please hear me. The one called Muriel is not our true enemy. Ohhh... I shall lead you to our true foe! Yes! Lead us! Who is it? Who is it? We shall defeat our foes! The true enemy has crated us and callously sold us as food! Who is it? We must attack the grocery store! Yeah! Raid! Raid! Attack! Follow me! This is not the great eggplant! This is not even a pretty good eggplant! [shocked murmurs] I've seen this one on the surface, with the one called Muriel. I knew it! The cunning Muriel sent a spy down to lead us off her trail. Well, it won't work! Tie up this spy! No more waiting for the great eggplant. Fellow eggplants, attack! [shouting] Attack! [shouting] What's that? What? More eggplants? I hate eggplants! Wait a minute! What's going on? Hate eggplants, huh? Why can't we all just get along? Hey! Let go! Let me go! Aah! Eggplants, follow me! [shouting] Attack! Oh! Oh, my, what lovely, luscious, plump eggplants! Oh, heavens! I've got to save Muriel. [inhales] Huh? So what do you say, boss? We grill her, right? Grill? No way! Fry her! Fry? She'll dry out! Not if you use a low flame. That will take forever. I'm hungry now! [gasp] Computer, how do you get rid of bad eggplants? [computer speaking] No! Bad eggplants that attack people! COMPUTER: Oh, well, that's different. Eggplants only attack when they run out of water. Water? Of course! [computer speaking] Help me! Get me out of here! Muriel, get me out of here! Some of your eggplants went bad! Real bad'.! I'll be back! I must look for water! Where are you going? Come back here, you good-for-nothing dog! Fry her! Grill her! Fry her! Grill her! Fry her! Yes! Grill her! Fry her! Grill her! Hey! Why don't we bake her? Yeah! Yeah! COURAGE: Oh, no, you don't! [grunting] Hey! Didn't we tie you up? Didn't you tie him up? Yeah, we tied him up, boss. I thought we tied him up. Get him! [shouting] Help! Help! I'm dying of thirst! Eh? Aah! We're taking root. Hey, this feels nice. Mmm...Yeah. What a nice garden you have here, Muriel. Very nice. The soil is so warm. And comfy. Oh, yeah! Grow, baby, grow! They seem like such nice eggplants. It would be a shame to cook them. I have an idea. ANNOUNCER: And the award for eggplant most likely to succeed goes to Babighanoush, raised by our own Muriel Bagge! [audience cheers] And the award for surliest eggplant, Eustace Bagge. G rrrr! I hate eggplants! Stupid dog! EUSTACE: Stupid dog! Ha ha ha ha!
