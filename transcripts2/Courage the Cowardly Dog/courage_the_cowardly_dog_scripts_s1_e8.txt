Whoooaaa! [whimpering] Ohhh! [whimpering] [grunting] Whoo. [ringing bell] [both laughing] EUSTACE: Courage! Uh-[stammering] Shhh. Where are you, stupid dog? I'll be right back. Don't make me look for you. Where's my raincoat, you stupid dog? [speaking gibberish] Thanks. I'm waitin.' Know what I have for you? [whimpering] Ba-ba-ba-ba-booga! Aah! [laughs] He treats you so badly. One shouldn't act unkindly to others. Ohh! Look. Look. Stupid dog. [laughs] Ha ha ha. That's better. You try. [laughs] [both laughing] Oh, Courage, I was afraid you'd get wet and cold out in the barn all night. You're just in time for breakfast. Come in. Come in. A friend of Courage is always welcome here. I was so worried, Courage. I'm happy now. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Aah! Ooh! [gasps] Ooh! Didn't I tell you we got no place for the likes of you? Now, git! And stay out. Now, Eustace. He's Courage's friend. That makes it worse. Oh, Eustace, don't make such a fuss. Sit down and eat your breakfast. I'll even get those little blueberries you like so much. Eh, well, I wouldn't mind if you did. I'm sort of hungry. [mumbles] You know how you spell "ugly"? U...You, you, you, you, you, you! And you sure are extremely...Bald. [stammering] [laughs] Oh, yeah? Well, you look like something the cow spit up. You, sir, are extremely bald. [sputtering] Aww...Aww... [sputtering] And the only thing uglier than this...Is this. Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee. Are you bald? Yes. Gm! Eustace, have you no sense of hospitality? Nope. Well, then, you can take your breakfast and eat it in the henhouse. [whimpering] But--but-he called me bald. Eustace, you are bald. Well, keep him out of my sight. And why don't you two go out and play? Muriel, I'm hungry. Muriel! Hear what I say? Hungry! [Sigh] Aww. [grumbling] Muriel. No dinner. No nothing. Muriel! [bells ringing] [giggles] What do you think you're doing? Oh! Enjoying the concert. Get your chair. That thing! In my raincoat! Get your ugliness out of my coat. Aah! You little... That's it. Now you just keep walking till I can't see you no more. You stupid dog. It's always your fault. Look at me. [whimpering] Boo-boo-boo-boo-booga! Aah! [laughs] Aah! What did that little dog ever do to you? I told you to git. What goes around comes around. Do you really want to see ugly? Uh... Stupid dog. Aah! Help! Aah! Huh? [crash] Eustace, are you all right? [groaning] [groaning] I think it's time I left. [whimpering] [ringing bell] [laughs] [bell ringing loudly] [both laughing] Thank you for your kindness. I hope I find more people like you out there. [laughs] I'm sure you will. [thunder] Empty. My heart is empty, and my clouds are full. [thunder] [honk honk] [lightning crashes] A goose, a gander, a godly goosey gander, without love, is nothing but a fowl. Without love, all of this is but puff and fluff and stuff. [honk honk] [thunder] The coming rain should do these flowers good. Darn horn. Eustace? It'll be raining any minute now. You should come inside. [gasps] [honk honk] [heart beating] [honk honk] [whimpering] Oh, pure and formless beauty. Oh, light, oh, sky, oh, baby's breath. You have grown solid. You have grown real. You have grown fat. You have grown real fat, and your name is... Muriel, Muriel! Muriel. If letters be in order, let them be in such order as to spell...Muriel. Muriel! Where's my pliers? I am filled, full, and dizzy. I am... A stuffed goose. [sigh] If I gaze at her longer, I shall be consumed. Has ever a Goose God gazed upon such unfeathered beauty, immortal flesh? Does a Goose God pursue a mortal woman? Does one who calls the clouds home love one who must floss? Does a Goose God love a Muriel? Eh, I'll give it a shot. [gasps] [speaking gibberish] Courage, what is it? [roaring] [speaking gibberish] [whimpering] Courage, you sound awful. How about a cup of hot tea with honey and a wee nap? Ooh, forget the tea. Ahem. B-b-but... You must have seen a bird, Courage. Flowers. Candy. They pale in the wake of her beauty. Huh? Muriel! Muriel! Where's my pliers? Did you take my--eh? What you got there, dog? [whimpering] What? Why, Eustace. For me? What a sweet surprise. Eustace, you are a dear man. No, no! It's that goose thing. If I am to make her mine, I must toss away my fears like lint from a dryer. I am a Goose God, and I must have this woman as my Queen. [honk honk] [gasping and whimpering] Now, Courage, it's not polite to point. Mortal woman, I am here to pronounce eternal love for you. And you pronounced it perfectly. You do not understand. I present to you an expression of my love. This gift. [growling] Ah, that's sweet, but I'm spoken for. Mm-hmm. But thank you. I've never had an endless field of flowers before. It's very flattering. [thunder] [sigh] [lightning crashes] Who was that? It was an admirer who offered me a field of flowers and his eternal love. Oh. You seen my screwdriver? That goose better not try to take Muriel away. [growls] It's true. [doorbell rings] Oh, it's a poem. [Goose reading] -[gagging] - Then all days be sunny, all days shall be spring. He does have a way with words. Oh! [speaking gibberish] [blows nose] Aiiee. [guitar playing] J" When a Goose God loves a woman J" S' A woman, big and round S' J" When a Goose God loves that woman J" J" A Goose God makes this sound J" [honk honk] Oh, how lovely. [whimpering] Don't listen. Don't listen! [sigh] [speaking gibberish] Booga-booga-booga! Aah! Well, if he's not going to do anything... Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm. [harp playing] Oh, Eustace. That's lovely. [whimpering softly] [wind blowing] [whimpering] [knocking on door] J" Goose God and Muriel, Goose God and Muriel J" J" Goose God and Muriel forever J" Thank you. [sigh] [growling] [grunting] [doorbell rings] J" Eustace and Muriel, Eustace and Muriel J" S' Eustace and Mur-S' oh'.! [crash] Oh, I'm famished. That goose has gotta go. [munch munch] Mmm. [record player playing upbeat tune] Oof! Oof. Come with me, fleshy Muriel. Come with me on goosey wind and wing to Valhalla, where you shall be my fleshy Queen. Oh, no! You make an old woman feel young again. [gasps] But my place is here with the man I love, and my dear precious Courage. COURAGE: Yay! [marching band music playing and blowing horn I think it's best if you find another. [door closes] - Eee! - If I cannot win Muriel with my love, then I shall take her. [thunder] [speaking gibberish] Oh! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Eek! [speaki ' "g gibber. ng] [honks horn] Aah! Oh! [honking horn] That--that sound. What is that glorious sound? [honking horn] Uhh. Well, I never. Oh, I have found you. [gasps] I have found my true love. I have found my Queen. N-n-n-n-n-n-no. I am not his Queen. Oh, speak to me again, my Queen. Make your sounds of love and longing. [honk honk] [honk honk] [honk honk] [honk honk] [honk honk] [hon k] [hon k] [honk] Come, my Queen. Ascend with me. The heavens await our harmony of honk. Aiiee! [moa"I"9] Heh? My truck! Look, Courage, we've been invited to a wedding. The goose and Eustace's truck are going to get married. [sobbing] I'm nothing without my truck. Come back to me, truck. [sobbing] Come back! [honk honk] [baaa] S' Waa-aaa-aaa-aaa S' S' Bum-bum-bum-bum... S' [baaa] S' Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-aah S' J" ...Bum-bum-bum-J" EUSTACE: Stupid dog! Ha ha ha ha.
