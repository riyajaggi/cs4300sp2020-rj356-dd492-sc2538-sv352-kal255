Muriel...Big mole... Eating people...Ugly teeth... Search, search, search! COMPUTER: Oh, you're such a lousy typist. Oh, yeah, thanks a lot. You're welcome. What you've got here is a weremole. Don't tell me that. They come out in the full moon and they've got a taste for rabbits and people. And if you're bitten by a weremole, you become one yourself. What should I do? COMPUTER: if I were you, I'd get a big mallet and-- No, no, no! A cure! A cure! Oh...That's easy. Get a little hair of the mole that bit you. Just don't get bitten. Where's that darn mallet? Can't bop a mouse without me mallet. Owvvw! That's not me mallet! Ahhh! Me mallet! The things I do for love. Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! What'd you do? I almost had it! You ruin everything.

MURIEL: Oh, no, I'm not going to see that woman. EUSTACE: Well, I ain't goin' if somebody doesn't go with me. So why not take Courage? Ohhhh! I don't wanna take that dog. Well, all right, I'll take him. You're better than nobody. Now, are you sure you have all the presents? Yeah, I got 'em. And be polite, take your hat off in the house, and give your mommy my regards. Are you sure you don't want to go? Be off with you now, my favorite show is starting. Listen up, dog. Here's the plan. When we get to ma's, I'll give you the high sign. That's the high sign. When I give the high sign, you act like a mad dog and attack ma! You know how to growl, don't you? You just open your mouth and... [roars] Ahhhh! Got that? Got that? Hi, ma! Hello, Courage! Good to see you! [Whimpers] [Courage mumbling] Eustace, you stupid boy! Ahhhh! Mad dog! Mad dog! I'll protect you, ma! Ahhh! That's no way to treat my little Courage. We'll go in and sit down and have us a nice visit. I'm sorry, ma. How impolite to wear my hat in the house. Put your hat back on. You look like a billiard ball. Aw, the little hound. Don't you feed him? Poor little fella looks hungry. Now, Courage, you just make yourself comfortable and I'll be back with some food. What are you doing sitting at the table? Ok, I'm not at the table! Courage, please sit down. Now, you just eat to your heart's content. It's not my fault! I'm not even hungry! You can have the cherry. Get that thing away from me! No wonder the little dog wants to share his food. You're all skin and bones. If you'd come to see your ma, you might get something to eat, but do you come? No! I'm here, ain't I? Yeah, and I suppose you want me to feed you, too. Uh, well, I wouldn't mind if you did... I'm sort of hungry. Well, all right. What are you doing sitting at the table, dog? I'm not! I'm not! Eat up. Oh... Don't put your head down. Don't eat too fast. Pull your socks up! Don't slouch! Sit up! Why can't you be more civilized? Like Courage. Noooooo! Eh, well-- Don't talk with your mouth full. In fact, don't say anything at all. How'd you like that meal? Ohhhhh... Fine, let's go sit in the next room and chat. Stop making ma like you so much! Got it? MA: Eustace, come here, you stupid boy! Hold on, ma. I got you some gifts. Oooh, I hope this works. Ah-choo! Ohhhh... Yuck! You know I don't like chocolates! How about a photo? Heh heh heh. Good. Hold the mirror. Heh heh heh heh. Ok, I'm done. Make it nice. Cheese. Courage, don't we look great? Guess what? I have a surprise for you. Here! When ma gets back, you take a picture of us. You stupid little dog-- MA: Stop it! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Ready for your surprise? Hey! That's mine! Why don't you ever give me any presents? Want something, do ya? Ooga booga booga! Ooohhhhh! Ha ha ha! You're still a fraidy baby! Ha ha ha ha! Your pa was a real man. You can't fill his shoes. Not a man, huh? I'll show you! We'll see who's the best man. You want me to shame you in front of your dog, huh? Ok, let's do it. You never liked me. You stupid boy! Ahhhh! Do something. If I lose... You lose. You stupid dog. Nooooo! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah ah-chooo! My hair! Oh, no! I'm ugly! I'm Ugh'! Ma! Where'd your hair go? You upset ma, you stupid dog. It's all your fault. My hair! My hair! I'm Ugh'! How could you love a mother who has no hair? No, ma. You always looked good to me. Boo hoo...l did? Thank you, son. But you're the ugliest boy I ever did see. Ha ha ha ha! Heh heh heh heh! That's my ma. MURIEL: Well, how did it all go? Yeah, yeah, nice visit. Have to do it again... Real soon. Isn't that nice? What did you all do? Oh! Isn't that lovely? EUSTACE: Stupid dog!
