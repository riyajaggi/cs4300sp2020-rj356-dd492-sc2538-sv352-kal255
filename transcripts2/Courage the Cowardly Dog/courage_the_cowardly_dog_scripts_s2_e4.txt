 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Get the dour, dag. [GRUNTS] And keep folding that sheet right. [GROANING] [GROANING] [SHOUTING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Stupid dag. You covered a stranger with my sheet. This should make you feel better, Mr. Frith. New tell us what happened to you, you pear man. What's happened ta me isn't important. What's important is what might happen ta you... ...and what happened thousands of years ago. The clothing in this sack tells the story. This belonged to a Mayan princess a long time ago. The princess loved cookies. Each day, the royal baker would whip up a jar full of cookies for the princess. The cookie jar was brought to the princess by her most trusted royal pooh-bah. And before he would give the cookies... ...the greedy pooh-bah would steal cookies from the jar and sell them for his own profit. One day, the baker caught the pooh-bah and went to tell the princess. But the pooh-bah got to her first. The pooh-bah presented the princess with cookie jars that were only half full... ...and said the baker was stealing the missing cookies. The princess was outraged... ...and ordered the baker to have his mouth sewn shut... ...his eyebrows plucked and his body mummified. Mast unpleasant. Ha, ha. That baker is new a centuries-old mummy. And he's risen. - Aah! - And he's seeking revenge. [SCREECHES] And he's an his way to this very spat at this very moment. [SCREAMING] Why here? Why us? Here is an ancient drawing of the princess and the pooh-bah. [EUSTACE E MURIEL GASPING] MURIEL: They lack just like we do. I think I'll take a nap now. [GROANS] [GRUNTING] MAN [OVER COMPUTER]: If your mommy's coming... ...and she's mad at you, give her ?owers, you (wit. Ah. A mummy. That's much worse. Maybe Muriel and the farmer... ...were the Mayan princess and royal pooh-bah in past lives. If that's so, the solution to your angry mummy... ...might be found in past-life regression hypnosis. [HOWLING] [SIRENS WAILING] MAN: Okay, everyone out. [GROANING] Okay. EUSTACE: Stupid dag. Dressing us up as stupid pooh-bahs. Ain't no such thing as past lives. Anyways, I can't be hypnotized. Uh-uh. Can't be hypnotized. I can't be hyp-- Huh? [GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Huh? [GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Told you, can't be hypnotized. After we jumped from the plane, I told him, "if you forgot to pack your parachute... ...that's your problem, and don't you land on me." But he did. We brake our legs and wound up in the same hospital, fell in lave... ...then we gut married in the middle of a jump. And did you know that sky diving is good for your gums... "because it is, and it's good for other things too. Here, my princess, is your daily supply of royal cookies. Thank you, mast trusted royal pooh-bah. Oh, these smell heavenly. My compliments ta the royal baker. Yeah, yeah, compliments, sure. Hmm. Something wrung, Your Princessness? There seems to be some cookies missing from the royal cookie jar. Royal pooh-bah... ...do you know who could be responsible for such a terrible crime? Ain't me. Gut any sugar cane? [WHISTLING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Hey, want a ride? [GROANS] Well, get in, foal. [ENGINE REVVING] Of course, I believe you, trusted pooh-bah. But then, who is stealing my cookies? I'm working an it. Gut more sugar cane? Royal servant, fetch my mast trusted pooh-bah more sugar cane. Huh? [GROANING] Fan harder, royal servant. [PANTING] Fan harder, royal servant. [BARKING] [GROANING] [SCREAMING] It's the royal baker. Haw goes the royal baking, baker? [GROANING] [SHOUTING] [COURAGE SCREAMING] He did it. The baker stale the royal cookies. The baker? What proof do you have? [CONTINUES GROANING] [LAUGHING] Told you I was working an it. Oh, my. Then we have to mummify the royal baker. [BARKING] Huh? Oh, my. Then we have to mummify the pooh-bah. The baker is trying to confuse you. He's guilty, and the royal servant must be in cahoots with him. [SCREAMS] [CONTINUES GROANING] Huh? [WHIMPERING] Yeah, I gut what you're lacking for, all right. I gut it right here. [GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] It was you all along, no-longer-trusted pooh-bah. I order your lips sewn shut, your eyebrows plucked... ...and the rest of you mummified. [SCREAMING] Sorry, royal baker. I goofed. You're exonerated cf the crimes cf which you are accused. [MUMMY GROANING] Ooh! [SlGHS] Haw can I ever make it up to you? Hmm. I'm telling you, I just can't be hypnotized. These are from an old Mayan recipe I never knew I knew. [ensues] [FRITH GROANING] If you don't like them, you don't have to eat them. Wasn't me. FRITH: Dc I smell cookies? [FRITH GROANING] Ah. I needed that nap. Did I miss anything? Oh, no, not really. The mummy's been and gone, gone to a peaceful eternal rest. He's really not such a bad fellow. A little musty, perhaps. He stank. Give me more cookies. He was lacking a mite chilly in those old rags, though... ...so I gave him a nice clean sheet to wrap himself in. Sheet? Which sheet? The polka-dotted one. [CRYING] That's my favorite sheet. Na way that mummy's gonna get it. [SNORING] EUSTACE: You lousy, sheet-stealing mummy. Give me back my sheet. [EUSTACE GROANING] I want my sheet. Give me back my sheet. [COURAGE GRUNTING] COURAGE: Oh?

Your mother's working for us now. Stay in school, sleep often, and practice good hygiene. Told you it was an ugly rack. MAN 1: You gather, but you didn't get the stone. MAN 2: I thought the stone was invisible. MAN 1: The stone just makes you invisible, idiot. Just track the stone and get it. MURIEL: If it's my secret, blue-ribbon dag-fund recipe you're wanting... ...then you should know, I'm not talking. Ugly rack, ain't it? VINDALOO: If I am to find the antidote... "someone has to put the thing an and disappear. My tests show the stone doesn't work on dogs. I don't know why. It just doesn't. Stupid dag. Stupid ugly rack. This will take some time. Dag, go sniffing around for the invisible one. By the time you find her, I hope I have the antidote. [SNIFFING] MAN 1: Give it up, lady. We want it, and we want it now. MURIEL: I don't care haw badly you want to win that dag-fund contest... ...I'm not talking. Good, good. You have become invisible very well. Yeah, thanks a heap. Okay, antidote test number one.
