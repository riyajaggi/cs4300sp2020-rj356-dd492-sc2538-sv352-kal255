This is not like her. Ooh! GUARD: Halt! Who goes there? Oh, it's a sweet old lady. FIRST DUCK: I told you to stop doing that. COMPUTER: Number 8...Number 8... just stop laying eggs and concentrate. Oh, you're not the boss of me. [coughing] Give it here. I'm clear, I'm clear. So who's complaining now? Huh? Huh? Hey! A nice little old lady. What are you doing here? COMPUTER: Number 8...Number 8... [German accent] Duck. DUCKS: Ow! Do you give? Do you give? DUCKS: Hey! [snoring] [ducks, Courage gasping for breath] DUCKS: Ooh! Yeah, that's right. You'd better run. How does this thing work? Come on, come on. Uh, oh, oh. Huh? We have not yet begun to fight. [screaming] J" Oh, mama, you know what I want J" We'll knock her block off. You and who else? Yeah, yeah. Right jab, left hook. No, no. Cover his face. Leave me alone. I know what I'm doing. Oh, you know what you're doing, hey? S' Shake it, baby S' COURAGE: Hey, hey. Let's have a fair fight. No low blows. Ok, ok. Any other rules? Yeah, for one thing. None of this. DUCKS: Ouch. And, none of this. Ow! And none of this. Ouch. Got it? I think so. You mean, none of this? Ouch. And we can't do this? Hey! Ow! And we certainly won't do this. Oh! Is that it? Yeah. You got it. S' Come on, baby S' [gasps] DUCKS: Oh! Now look what you did. What I did? Now what are we going to do? Why are you asking me? Oh, so you don't have all the answers, hey? Just leave me alone. [weeps] Stop telling me what to do. [weeps] Hey, fellows. What's the matter? It's--it's our brother. He's in there. Will you stop interrupting me. Our brother was captured. And now he's going to get cooked unless we get him out. And now we'll never get him out. We didn't mean to hurt anyone. We just wanted to get our brother out. Why didn't you just ask for help? I told you we should have asked. You never said that. Yes, I did. No, you didn't. You were too busy laying eggs. Fellas... Stop talking about my eggs. Fellas! Eggs.eggs, eggs,eggs,eggs! Fellas! DUCKS: What? Don't worry, I'll help you. You will? How can you help us? I have a plan. [Courage whispering] [ringing] Hey! A cute little doggy. What are you doing here? COURAGE [German accent]: Duck. Hey! Bring that duck back. What am I going to serve? [German accent] Strudel. Oh! Good idea. I don't know how we can ever thank you. Me, neither. THIRD DUCK: I'm so happy, I could just... All right, can we just stop doing that? You did it, too. I was just overcome. I won't let it happen again. Don't try to hide your emotions. I'm not hiding anything. I just don't think it's appropriate for duck brothers to lay eggs. THIRD DUCK: I don't think it's right for you to judge us. Maybe we should have just left you there in the kitchen, huh? COURAGE: Oh! How lovely. Can you believe the special treatment we're gettin'? Uh-huh. Technology. COMPUTER: Number 8. COURAGE: I know I put it here somewhere. Oh! Hey. What's this? Ah, your sweet brother. I do miss him. Blah! Blah! Blah! I don't. You two never got along. And today is his birthday, isn't it? Who cares? Anyway, the bum died without telling me where he hid his box full of money. So, happy birthday to nobody. [Courage mumbles] Get away from me. [mumbling] [Courage whines] What's the matter with you, dog? One little clue is all I... [Courage mumbling] [yelling] You stupid... That's it! That's the box I've been looking for. Good dog, Courage. I wonder what's in it, Eustace. I'll tell you what's in it: his money. My good-for-nothing brother's money. It's all mine. I'm gettin' me tools. [monster growling] [screams] No! What's the matter with you, dog? [babbling] [screams] [growls] Don't open that. Stupid dog. Oh! [Eustace groans] Stupid box. I can't open it without the stinkin' key. Darn that Horst. He hated me. What a shame you and Horst never settled your troubles. TV". The channeling channel will return after a word from our sponsor. Are you trying to contact the dead? Are you trying to reach the-- Blah! Blah! Blah! Shirley the Medium can put you in touch with the hereafter. So you all can live--and die--happily ever after. What a wonderful idea. We can hire Shirley. You and your brother can lay your troubles to rest once and for all. Our differences are settled. He's dead, and I ain't. Come now, Eustace. Isn't there anything you'd want to talk to him about? It is his birthday. Yeah. Now that I think of it, there is. Heh, heh, heh. [Courage gasps] Don't worry, Courage, dear. I'll feed you in a minute. Oh, I just know something bad is going to happen, or my name is Archibald. And it's not. COURAGE: Ew? One thing: if you contact the dead for personal gain, there will be tragic consequences. EUSTACE: Just dial my dead brother and shut up. SHIRLEY: Join hands. ["Telephone" ringing] You're on my payroll now. Wake up and get my brother on the line. [ringing] The party is not answering. He never took my calls. Courage, babbling: ...Yo-yo? I shall try. I see, I see, I see! [gasps] A yo-yo. Yes. I see a yo-yo. It is under the sofa. [groans angrily] Try my brother again. [ringing] WOMAN: Hello? Hello? Aunt Gertrude? Oh, for pete's sake. GERTRUDE: Muriel, oh, Muriel. How are you? I'm just fine, thank goodness. Hang up, you're tying up the line. GERTRUDE: You are using vinegar, aren't you? Vinegar? In raspberry jam? [gags] EUSTACE: Will you two quit jabberin'? Now, get my stinkin' dead brother Horst on the line. SHIRLEY: The dead should not be bothered for personal gain. What? Oh, just do it. [Courage barking] EUSTACE: Sit down, you stupid dog. [Courage whines] [ringing] MAN: Hello? Isn't this wonderful, Eustace? Finally you can settle your differences. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's the key to the box? HORST: There is nothing in the box for you, Eustace. You would say that, you cheap-- Bury the box, Eustace. [grunts angrily] [speaking gibberish] Get away from me. Oh! Money, money! Where's the key? HORST: There's nothing in there for you. Give me the key. Ok. Ok? Search the lining of your hat. So that's where it was. You have been warned, brother. [laughing] SHIRLEY: You should heed your brother's word. We don't need you anymore, lady. Take off! You shall not be warned... Again. No, no, no! What's wrong with you, dog? Scat! [crash] Huh? Hello? Don't open the box. You're not getting my money whoever you are, so just shove off. [babbling] What do you think of that, Courage? [groans] You're right. Too much vinegar. [Eustace laughing sinisterly] Oh! This is not good. [laughs] I knew it. We're rich, we're rich! Did you say something, Eustace? Oh! [Eustace screams] Hey! What are you doing in my box? With my money? [Eustace screams] [screaming] COURAGE: Ok, you can have him. [screaming] Oh! Courage! Help! [screaming] MURIEL: Oh! Oh! [screaming] [screaming] Ooph! Rope, rope, rope, rope. I need a rope. Yes! My clothesline. Did you fold the clothes? Uh-huh. Such a good dog. [babbling] The stupid one. He opened the box, yes? [Eustace, Muriel screaming] You had to open the box. Mucho loco... [mumbling in foreign Spanish] MURIEL: Oh! I knew there was money in that box. [yells] EUSTACE: Look at all this money. Whoopee. I'm rich. I'm finally rich. I'm rich, I'm rich! [laughs] Hey! Where am I going to spend it? Mmm...Mmm... Eustace, Aunt Gertrude was right. This jam tastes heavenly. EUSTACE: Can I buy some from you? You can have all you want when you get out of there. But first we have to find that key. EUSTACE: Stupid dog! Ha ha ha ha!
