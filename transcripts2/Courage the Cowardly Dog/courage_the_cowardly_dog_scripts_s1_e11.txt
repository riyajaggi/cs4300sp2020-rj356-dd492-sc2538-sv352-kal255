[Eustace laughs] Isn't that cheeky? And I suppose you'll be wanting your laundry done, too. Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha! [crash] Oh, that had to hurt. Aha. Eustace...Now you've gone too far. Sometimes a dog's got to do what a dog's got to do. I'm the only dog here. I say, don't you want your root beer? [burps] Ahh. I needed that. Thanks. Anytime. Oh! [menacing voice] and never return. [clanking and drilling] I know I'm not going to like this. [cheering] Oh, I love a good family brawl. [helicopter] EUSTACE: I've got to wreck. Muriel, I'll save you. Let me out of here, I say. Oh, thank goodness. Courage! Stupid helicopter dog. Hey, that's my washing machine. Hey, that's my chair. Finders keepers. [growling] Oh! Now look what you made me do. Wrecked my chair, well, I-- You're mad! Oh! Stop this at once. Oh, no! Aah! You need a specialist. Oh! I-I-I could help you. Aah! KATZ: No, no, please. I'll buy you a new chair. Good god, man.
