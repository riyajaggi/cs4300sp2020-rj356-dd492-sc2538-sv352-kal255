Now, this is a bed I can sleep in any day. [low growling] MAN: Hello, new friend. My name is Fred. The words you hear are in my head. I say, I said, my name is Fred, and I've been very naughty. I can't wait for that wee lad Fred to arrive. That freak's not setting one freaky foot in this house! FRED: The story I'm about to tell, I tell you, I will tell it well, is of my dear aunt Muriel and just how I've been...naughty. The freak's a barber, a freaky barber with his own freaky barber shop where freaky things happen-- Freaky barber things! FRED: Voila, the farm. My aunt lives here with precious pup and husband dear. My heart beat fast as I grew near. I felt so nice... and naughty. [doorbell rings] Oh, that must be Fred! [ding dong] [gulp] Ooh! [ding dong] FRED: I thought just how excited they must be that I would come today. They'd shout, "come, Fred, hazzah hooray! Dear boy, you look so... naughty." oh, Fred, me dear nephew. What brings you to our cozy corner of the world? Holiday. Courage, come and meet Fred. Oooh! FRED, VOICEOVER: That's when my tired eyes beheld a doggie dog. Like dog he smelled. D-o-g is what he spelled, and that's how I spell... naughty. Eeeeee. EUSTACE: Got to go to the hardware store and get the, you know... fix the bathroom door. Just don't try shutting it because you won't be able to get it open. Eustace, our guest is here. Say hello to Fred. Yeah. Ooohhh. Hiya... freak. [panting] Courage, shush now. You must be exhausted, Fred, dear. Would you like to freshen up? Yes. Been quite a trip, it has. Show Fred the bathroom, please, Courage. No! Such a fuss. This rudeness won't do. Ok. I'll do it, but I won't like it. Ok, I'm going... freak. Eustace, dear... could you do me a favor? I forgot to give Fred fresh towels. Would you bring him some? Ew. You give them to the freak. No! Whoops! COURAGE: Oooh! Heh heh heh heh! I heard the door slam. The door slammed. Oh. Ugh! Ugh! Well, I guess I better git. Now, don't you boys worry. Eustace will be back soon to get the door open. Ooh! FRED, VOICE-OVER: Alone was I with tender Courage and all his fur, his furry footage, which, I say, did enCourage me to be... quite naughty. Courage. Aaoooh! Your hair... it reminds me of the first time I knew just how I felt about hair. VOICE-OVER: It was a day I do not forget-- the day that I first met my pet. Oh, what a lovely gift to get. I'd never felt so...naughty. My fuzzy friend is what he was, this darling little ball of fuzz. [clanking] [razor buzzing] And oh, such fuzz, such fuzz, he does demand that I be naughty. He looked at me, his fetching eyes, and fetching fur did hypnotize. I filled with joy, I filled with sighs, and that's when I got... naughty. [Courage gasping] Now, now. You shouldn't play in the toilet. Don't worry, boys. Eustace should be at the hardware store by now. [bird squawking] FRED, VOICE-OVER: This dripping hair, this droopy curl... unfurls sweet memories of a girl with tresses, oh, they twist and twirl and tempt me to be...naughty. Barbara my love was named and her fair hair, a mane untamed, until one evening, I'm ashamed, I got a little... naughty- [razor buzzing] The look upon my young love's face was sweet and lace, but in this place, I realized she... [turns off razor] Needed space. I nevermore was naughty. Well, maybe not never. COURAGE: Ooh! Playful little scamp. Eeeeeuuuuh! Is everything all right in there? [Courage howls] Just can't wait for those pancakes, can you? [Courage howls] Wonderful! Eustace should be back any moment now. Aaaah! [sea gulls crying] No need for panic. Behold. Sustenance, hungry whelp. [gulp] [beeping] [Courage gagging] FRED, VOICE-OVER: Dear cur, your fur and fleece remind of nothing found in humankind but for one fellow who did find me to be in a certain mood. Into my shop he walked one day with bouche above and beard bouquet. That's no toupee, I prayed. No way! I could help but be... you know. MAN: Just a trim, pardner. FRED, VOICE-OVER: I'd never seen such hair before. [buzzing] His bangs, they sang, his neck, it beckoned. Eyebrows, armpits-- all were reckoned. Soon I figured "what the heck" and guess how I was... naughty. COURAGE: Ooh! [music playing on television] COURAGE: Aah! [gibberish] [snoring] [razor buzzing] Aaoooh! Sweet pooch, afraid I'll shave your tail? Why, now, that would be weird. [sirens] [brakes screech] MAN: Surround the area! Cut the power! We don't want anyone getting shaved in there! So ends our little story. What took them so long? FRED, VOICE-OVER: But then my landlords did presume to free me from that porcelain tomb and ferry to a private room, your hero, ever dotty. What a lovely visit. Too bad Eustace didn't get to say good-bye. FRED: Good-bye, dear aunt. I'll miss your farm and Eustace's ebullient charm. And farewell, Courage, what's the harm if I was slightly... naughty? EUSTACE: Stupid dog! Hee hee hee!
