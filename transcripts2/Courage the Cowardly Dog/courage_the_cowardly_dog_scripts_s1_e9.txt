 MURIEL: Courage, what is it? [whines] Stupid dog. Courage, do you mind repeating that? [groans] [whines] Oh, Courage, it must have been a fish. Nothin' to worry about. But--but--but... Oh... [s I u rps] I think I'll have some more tea myself. [dripping] What's that dripping sound? WOMAN: Eustace... Oh. Eustace... oh! Eustace... [babbling] MURIEL: Oh, my. What is it now? Ahh... Are you all right, Eustace? What? Yeah, yeah. Darned herbal teas. The kitchen ceiling's leaking again, Eustace. You'd better go fix it. [dripping] "Go fix it, Eustace". "Better fix it, Eustace". [dripping] [bang] Can't even fix a cup of tea. WOMAN: Eustace... Eustace... Huh? Eustace... Aah! Eustace... [grumbles] Ahh... Nee! [babbling] Tsk tsk tsk. Oh, Eustace, you don't look so well. Let's get you to bed now. [muttering] Huh? [howls] [pop] WOMAN: Come with me... Come with me. Come with me... MURIEL: Oh, my. I'm beginning to worry about you, Eustace. Tomorrow, we're off to see the doctor. That's all there is to it. [Eustace snoring, Courage whimpering] [doorknob jiggling] [snoring] Huh? Aah! This can't be happening. Eustace... [Courage whimpering] [gasps] [bird chirping] [Muriel crying] Eustace is gone. Oh, my Eustace. I knew something was wrong. [crying] I want my Eustace. [crying] There's only one thing to do. [sighs] But I won't like it. Ah, the things I do for love. Hey, is this puddle getting smaller? It is getting smaller! I'd better hurry before it closes up. Oh... [gasps] Ah...Ah... Why does that look familiar? [Whimpers] Eustace... [growling] Aah! [roars] [straining] [roars] [Whimpers] [growling] [growling] [Whimpers] [growling] [screaming] Let me out of here! I'll get you, you good-for-nothing... [Whimpers] [roars] Ow! [babbling] [roaring] [screams] [Muriel crying] Oh! Eustace! Courage! Uh! [hair dryer blowing] [woman growls] [thud] WOMAN: Wait till I get out of here! I'll get you, you... You're back! Oh, Eustace, you're back! Where have you been? Ow! What did I do? [sighs] [windmill squeaking] [clock ticking] [Eustace snoring] [scrubbing] [bubbling] Hmm? [bubbling] [windmill squeaking] [crickets chirping] [rocking chair creaking] [knock on door] Oh! I wonder who that could be. [growling] Hello. Hello. Who the heck are you? I'm Benton Tarentella. [crickets chirping] Benton Tarentella? [crickets chirping] The famous independent movie director. Oh, Eustace. He's a famous movie director. Never heard of him. I knew I saw your face before. You've been on television, haven't you? Well, yes. I knew it! I just knew it. He's famous, Eustace. Big deal. What do you want? I'll explain. May I? Oh, yes. Come in, Mr. Tarentella. Come in. Hmm... I was driving by, scouting locations for my latest blockbuster. Oh, scouting locations. That sounds so fancy! So what? This is my next Opus: The Return of the Zombies from Beneath the Farm. Ohh! A real movie script, Eustace! And? I want to make my movie here... On your farm... In this house. Oh, "W- We ain't interested. We'll pay tons of cash. Ok. We're interested. Excellent. Now, if you'll both sign down there on the "X." Aah! [babbling] What is it, Courage? [Whimpers] Muriel, has anyone ever told you that you should be in pictures? Oh, my goodness, no. Here's your contract. When do we get paid? Right after we shoot the movie... And we start shooting tonight. Ohh... Tonight? Oh, yes. Isn't this exciting? May I see your basement? Yeah, this is great. Great! We'll do the zombie resurrection scene here. This is a great angle. I love it. We can do a tracking shot over here, and then rack focus. Eustace, this place is a mess. We should really straighten up for the movie. Right. This is great. Great! Aah! [babbling] Courage, is something wrong? Muriel... [clears throat] In this light, well, you look like... You look like you have to be in my movie. Oh, "W- In this scene, you will play the victim of the zombie sacrifice. Gracious. That's so exciting! What's my role? Your role is digging the zombie's tomb. Now you're talkin'. Get away from me! This is my role. Oh...Oof...Ow...Ooh! And don't let me catch you down here again! Stupid scene-stealing dog... COMPUTER: Sorry. No record of Benton Tarentella in the independent film database or in any film listings. Hey, you want to sing a song I know? Just keep checking! Yeah. This is great! This is gonna be great! Courage: "Amateur Filmmakers Slay 12". [gasp] Oh, no! "Benton Tarentella and Errol Van Volkheim "Pose as film directors to lure unsuspecting victims to their fate. "Tarantella and Van Volkheim jailed. "Van Volkheim released for good behavior. Tarentella dies in prison." I knew it! Tarentella's a zombie! Ooh! But where's this other guy-- Van Volkheim? COMPUTER: He's dead. Yes! COMPUTER: And he was buried in a cemetery... Good. COMPUTER: That this house was built over. Not good. Right. That's right. Nice and tight. "Scene One: Fool old people. Scene Two: Dig Big Hole. Scene Three: When planets align, Dead partner rises from the grave. Scene Four: Eat old lady." Ooh! Perfect. You're just in time, doggie. I have a great role for you. You'll play the dog locked up in the trunk. Eustace? Stupid overacting dog! And quit stealing my scenes! [Courage wailing] That's very good, Courage. I didn't know you could act. The light is perfect. Now what do I do? Why, you're the cameraman. All you have to do is run the camera. Ha ha ha! Do I get paid extra? Sure. Excellent. Let's roll camera. Rolling! Ha ha ha! Great! This is gonna be great. Great effects! Benton. Errol. Let's set up for the next shot. Ja. I'm starving. Eustace, this next scene features Mr. Van Volkheim and myself as newly risen zombies about to devour Muriel. I'm going to promote you to director. What's the pay? Tons. Deal! Ha ha! [s I u rps] [muttering] Ok. ls everyone ready? Yes, yes. We know what to do. Let's roll it. Wait, wait! What? What? Move over. I can't see Muriel's face. Can we start now? How should I know? Check the script. Let's see. Here's the scene. The big zombie lets the dog out of the box. What? That's what it says. Let me see that. I don't remember... Well, if it's in the script... Ok. Yes! Now what? It says that the zombies go back in the hole and the dog buries them. What? This is not my work! This is not my work! I can't believe it. You are such a lousy writer. You have always been a lousy writer. It's not my work! I come all this way just for you to write me back in the grave! That's it. Our partnership is kaput, once and for all. I never want to work with you again. Ah, who wants to work with a hack like you, anyway? Oh, shut up! I never saw that ending coming. Courage, isn't this exciting? [Whimpers] When am I gettin' paid? Courage, dear, you stole the whole movie. I'm ready for my close-up now. [glass shatters] Ouch! Not that close! [sheep bleats] EUSTACE: Stupid dog!
