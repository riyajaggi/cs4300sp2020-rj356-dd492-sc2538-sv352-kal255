Those rocks will stop him. [moaning] [scream] That dog is becoming a real pain in my... [snore] Oh! Where am I? I'm just having one of those floating dreams. Oh well. [snore] [howling] Muriel!

You're trying to make a stew out of her. And a right good one she gonna be. [screaming] I knew she was there all along. Oh yeah. Yeah. [whistle blowing] [screaming] Ooh. That was some ride. Now where'd my little old granny go? There she is! Oooh! Muriel! I really should be in the Olympics. Oof! Will someone close the window? It's so drafty. I got you, Muriel! Ooh! Going somewhere? Nooo!
