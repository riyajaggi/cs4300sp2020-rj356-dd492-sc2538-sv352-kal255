 [Eustace sniffling] [ah-choc] Where did it say that Silver Springs timeshare was in the arctic? I wanted palm trees! I think it's a lovely change from all that hot sun. Stupid cold! [teeth chattering] We'll all feel much better after some nice hot soup. Oh! Courage, could you go out and find us some more wood? The fire is mighty low. I don't wanna go out there!

 I'm not a penguin, you know! Get that wood before I freeze to death! Where did this snowman come from? I certainly didn't build it. EUSTACE: Where's that stupid dog with that stupid firewood? And what do you think you're doing? Put that back! COURAGE: Aaaaaaah! [barking] Stupid dog! Where's the wood? [roar] Courage, I'm sure it's only some wee thing passing through. Let's sit down and have some soup. [whimper] What are you doing at the table?! Huh? Eeeeh? What's this? Ha ha ha! Oh, my! It's frozen! Isn't that a laugh? Did your soup freeze, too? Ahh... Aahh. Waa... Uhhh! [panting] Uh...Eeeeeeh! Oomph! Ah! Huh huh! Aaaaaaah! That's it! If you don't get me some firewood, you'll be sleeping with the icicle! But...But! Ooga booga booga! Ha ha ha! And don't come back without the firewood, neither! [Eustace laughing] Oh! What did I do? SNOWMAN: Ah, it's not like it was in the old days, when ice and snow were everywhere, and snowmen ruled the world. Ah, Jimbo. Jimbo the Snowman. Now, there was a snowman for an ice age. And Hohauser. Ha ha! He was a ton of snow! And lvanna...The snowgirl. How I really got lost in a snowdrift with her. I know I shouldn't follow it, but I gotta. Uh-oh. Aaaah! Ha ha ha ha! [snowman mumbling] SNOWMAN: How sad to be the last of the snowmen. It's been getting warmer and warmer. And if it continues, I will melt, and there will be no more snowmen! SNOWMAN: Ha ha ha! But this is not to be. I have found it! I have found the anti-melting gene of a human being! Ha ha ha ha! And how fortunate for me that there are human subjects here I can extract the gene from. Oh! I shall have this gene. I will not melt. But the human will! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! COURAGE: Aaaaaaah! Oh...Oh... Ohhhhh! [doorbell] Better be that dog with the firewood! You're not the dog! No. The name's Man. Snow Man. Aaaah! This kind of thing happens to me all the time! Uh-oh. This is not good! Muriel!! Mush! Aww! Ha ha ha ha! Whoa! This won't hurt. And think of all the good it will do. Aaaaahhhh! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Eureka! I have it! Hey! That's mine! Aaaahhhh! Oh! No! Noooo! Aaah...Ah! Blast! You stupid dog!

MURIEL: Courage! Help! Yes! Aah! Aaah! Assassin! Let me out of this! I can't get this thing off my head! [mumbling] SNOWMAN: I'll get you for this! Blast! It's getting warmer! Dog, prepare to meet your doom! It won't be long now! I will not be denied! Oh, Courage! Oh, what do we do? I'm feeling a bit warm! COURAGE: Aaaaah! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! [gasp] No! No! Nooooo! Aaah! Ah! The first frozen snowman! That's not too shabby! Poor Eustace! I don't know what we're going to do with him now! [Horn blows] Oh, look! We're going to be saved! Whew!
