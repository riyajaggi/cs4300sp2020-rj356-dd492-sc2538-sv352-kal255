 *MARVEL'S SPIDER-MAN* Season 03 Episode 03 Episode Title : "Vengeance of Venom" Aired on: June 21, 2020 One thing I didn't realize about becoming the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man was just how big the neighborhood could get. I'm used to keeping an eye on New York, but I never thought it'd be up to me to protect the entire planet from an impending alien invasion. And the first person I need to make sure is going to be safe?

 Oh. Hey, Peter. I didn't know you were home. Oh, what's that? School project? It's from the Space Agency. Look, Aunt May, I have some top-secret information, but you have to promise not to freak out. When do I ever "freak out"? Okay, well... there's a pretty high possibility that there might be, uh... some visitors. So you need me to clean up the guest room? No. These would be visitors from space

 invading our planet. Oh. You're not joking. I wish I was. If the invasion comes here, the device in this case is your best defense. Now, you have to... Ugh. I gotta to back to Horizon High. Promise me if anything happens, you'll keep yourself safe. Of course. But what about you? Do I ever do anything not safe? Got your urgent alert, Ironheart. Something's approaching Earth? Yeah. Might be a ship. On my way back. Any luck tracking down New York's other heroes? Reached out to the ones I either know or have seen online. Haven't heard from Prowler, Cloak and Dagger are somewhere in the East Village, but Moon Knight hasn't been seen in months. Keep trying. There's got to be other heroes out there who can help us. Is the Stark Counterinvasion Defense System up yet? Ghost-Spider, Spider-Girl, and Hobgoblin are getting the remote transceivers online. But I haven't been able to arm the system because a certain digital somebody hasn't cracked the codes. You're talking about me, aren't you? Well, let's see you decode 3.7 million encrypted files. There's the unidentified object that emerged from space. Has to be the symbiotes Star-Lord warned us about. No Avengers yet? Still off-planet. I've been calling, but no response. Then let's hope once Not Tony cracks the codes, this Stark Defense System works. Symbiotes are extremely adaptable. We'll only get one shot at containing them. It might not be our only option. I've identified an uninhabited dimension suitable to banish these creatures, but I'm not certain I could transport such a large group. Huh? That ship's coming right at the tower. It's the Avengers! I bet you already kicked all that space goop into a black hole. Seriously. We were afraid your ship was an invasion of symbi... Oh... oh, no! Symbiotes assemble. So anyone know who we call when we need to be saved from the Avengers? The good news is they only sent four alien symbiotes for us to take down. We got this. Right? We've spread through the outer reaches of the galaxy. All those who oppose us will join us! For alien slime, these guys speak pretty good English. The original Venom could absorb my memories. These symbiotes must've done - the same with the Avengers. - Great. Evil Avengers who know all our moves. Hey. Finally got it. Defense system code decoded. Impressed yet, kid? Perfect timing, Not Tony. Brothers and sisters, attack! Whoa! I'm blocked. Transmitting the decrypted codes to you, Spidey. Got it! You look different, Captain Marvel Trying a new sunblock? Jokes during an alien invasion? What? It's my gift Stark Counterinvasion Defense System initiated. Love the sound of that. Threat detected. Nullifying. Little cages? Tony thought that was the best way to stop an alien invasion? Never doubt Stark's tech. But wait, if the symbiotes absorbed Tony's memories, then... That. Defense system self-destruct. No! Groot! I am Venom! Any more thoughts on your Plan B? Not sure if it will work, but we're out of options. By Agamotto... Hey! That could've given me a concussion! That too! Ooh. That's ugly. So gross. I just cleaned... Nice. Looks like Cho's finally made some friends. Any ideas? Yeah. Duck! Tony's gonna kill me. Um, Ironheart? I'm picking up another interstellar object, and this one's way bigger. Looks like thousands of life-forms inside that thing. More symbiotes on the way? Were the Venom-Vengers just an advance group to clear the way for a full-scale invasion? We can't stop all of them. Not without help. Come on! Wait. No! Welcome home, Tony. No, no, no! Yes. Home. Our new home. First, a little housecleaning. Let the culling begin. Where are we going? Dr. Strange's idea of transporting the symbiotes to another dimension, we still might be able to do it. - How? - Cloak and Dagger. Cloak teleports through a pocket dimension. It'd be the perfect place to send the symbiotes. You said they were in the East Village, right? Attention. If you are receiving this message, the Avengers need your help. Report in immediately. What was that? Looks like a secret Avengers distress signal sent to every hero in Tony's database. Oh, no. Venom Tony must've sent that so all the heroes report in. And reveal their location. We gotta find Cloak. Now! Dagger! We need you and Cloak. Aliens are invading Earth. Um, yeah, I sort of figured that one out the hard way. Oh. Cloak is one of us now. This is absolutely the last time I'm coming to the East Village. Whoa! Hey, you lose this? So do you guys know what's going on? Cloak and I got a call from Avengers Tower but as soon as we reported in, Captain Amoeba here showed up. The distress call was a trap. Aliens have landed on Earth. And it looks like they're trying to take out all the heroes first. Rooftop advertising does return smashingly good results. In here. Well, there have to be Avengers left to stop these things, right? Yeah, not so much. I'm tapped into Evil Tony's distress signal. Looks like a few heroes are left, but, they're falling fast. There's gotta be a way to send out a warning that Iron Man's been compromised. I think I could pull that off. I built the thing after all. Well, Not-Not Tony did. I'll use the remote link. That's going to leave you vulnerable. If Venom Tony notices... I'll be fine. Who knows me better than me? Intruder? Too many Tonys. No room for imperfect copies. Cannot... Being purged. I failed, kiddo. No! Venom Tony purged my A.I. and severed my link to the system. Then it's too late. He has all the other heroes' locations by now. He'll hunt all of us down. So it's just up to us three. Do you guys have a plan? We did. But now we're just making this whole thing up as we go. Found you. Exit stage right! Please, Ty. It's me. Tandy... It's time to join us. Dagger! The seed has taken root. Our mission's nearly complete. The others will soon follow. Huh? Oh! Hey. Grab on! Sorry, gotta run! Text me! We're getting very good at running away. How much time do we have before that ship full of symbiotes comes crashing down to Earth? They're a couple hours away tops. But hopefully they won't land until their advance team calls and tells them it's all clear. However Venoms call and tell each other things. Riri, you're a genius! True. But, how is that relevant? The Venomized Dagger mentioned a seed. I've seen a symbiote seed before. I thought the original Venom was using it to terraform the Earth, but... what if he wasn't? What do you mean? Maybe Venom was sending a signal to his species that this planet was ready to be taken over. You think the seed was a communication device? Where is it now? Okay, okay, Peter. My legs are short. I can't move that fast. And what "seed" are you talking about? I don't see one anywhere. Maybe it's behind this glowing rock that looks like it's going to explode? Glowing? That can't be good. The symbiotes must be using it somehow. Maybe like a homing beacon. If that ship lands, it's game over. We have to cut off their beacon. Hello? You still there? I can't find any seed, but this rock is freaking me out. No, no. The rock is the seed! Oh. Then I found it. Grady, Spider-Man is heading to Horizon. We think that seed is sending a signal. See if you can come up with some ideas on how to disrupt it. But it's alien tech, so try not to destroy it. Who knows what that could cause. A Spider-Man mission? Ha! Hah! On it! If the Venoms follow us to Horizon, it'll jeopardize our plan. I'll lead them away. I can't do this alone! I'll stay on comms and meet you once the coast is clear. Come on! That all you got? Now that's more like it! I love a challenge. They got me cornered. I'm sending you all of Stark's decryption codes so you can access the Stark satellite and track their ship. Wait, what? No! Ironheart! Okay, you got this, Spidey. First, get to the seed. Stop that ship from coming, then figure out how to save your friends and this city. Venom smash! Sorry, Spider-Man. We know you want the seed, but it belongs to us. This is the worst party! Oh, come on! No one wants a timeout? Just me? Okay! Come on. There's too many of them. And only one of me. Check your math, Spider-Man. I thought I lost you at the tower. Gonna take more than some space slime to keep me down. Scratch that... eep us down. We might not be Avengers... But we've still got your back. And if there's one thing the Spider-Team knows how to handle, it's symbiotes. So what are you waiting for, a group text? Go save the day! Using matching frequencies to cancel out the signal? Clever, Grady! Way clever. But even though I determined the exact frequency, I can't seem to match the output level of the seed. It's still transmitting and we've got nothing stronger to amplify our blocker. Yes, we do. The school's Arc Reactor! I'm going to reroute its power to this lab. Maximizing the yield. Once the Arc Reactor's warmed up, it should send enough power to block the seed's transmission. No. Stay back! Excuse me. I was using that. Nice try, Spider-Man, but there's no stopping us. Victory is inevitable. Once our hunters pick off the last super-powered defenders, this planet will be ours. Grady, run! It's a big galaxy. I'm sure there's gotta be some other nice, uninhabited world you could take over. That's no fun! But this isn't just about taking your planet. You made this personal when you destroyed one of us. Venom? Hey, he started it! And we're finishing it. Earth will suffer because of you, Ssspider-Man! First of all, there's only one "S" in Spider-Man. And second of all... Shut up! It worked. The ship's leaving. What have you done? If the power from the Arc Reactor could destroy that seed, then I've got a new hypothesis. Miles, Spider-Girl, if anyone can hear me, the school's Arc Reactor has enough power to bring down these symbiotes. Heading in, Spidey. We can reroute that power out here. Well, that's pretty strange. Earthlings are no match for the Symbiote Supreme. PJs? Hang in there, Tony. You caught a real nasty parasite. Huh? Dr. Strange? You have lost, Spider-Man. Give in now. End your suffering. Do your research next time. The easy way out's never been my thing. I'm not giving up on you guys. Destroy him! When I started as Spider-Man, I never dreamed it would be up to me to stop an alien invasion. And that I would fail. I would call this a nightmare, but a bad dream is something you can wake up from. An invasion of Venom-like symbiotes has infected New York City. Guess who's the only hero left to stop them from taking over the rest of the world. Yep, overwhelmed and outnumbered... me. Before I can focus on saving anyone else, I've got to find Aunt May. Mrs. Parker? Your nephew sent me to find you! Mrs. Parker? May? Gone. There's no sign of a struggle. Aah! The Spider is so predictable. Dr. Strange. That names means nothing. We are the Symbiote Supreme. How did you find me here? Tony Stark is one of us now. He knows so much about you, Peter Parker, and about the ones you hold dear. What have you done with Aunt May? If you've hurt her... We do not damage. We improve. It is an honor to bond with us... A way to be part of something more important than petty humanity. You'll never take me as a host. We would never sully ourselves by bonding with the likes of you. You destroyed our brother Venom, so we will utterly destroy you. Aah! I'm not letting you win. Let us? You deluded human. You and your miserable species lost this war the moment we arrived on your world. Revenge is so satisfying. Looks like someone's getting ahead of himself. You haven't won yet! Rah! Aah! Aah. You never had a chance, Spider... What? Down! Yes, sir, stranger, sir! Aah! No! He's ours! Aah! Run, kid! Yeah. Already on it! Get him! Whoa. Bad aliens, good mechanics. We need to stay down here, out of sight. Lucky for you, no one knows the maze of tunnels beneath New York better than I do. They've been my base of operations for years. And who exactly are you? Name's Marc Spector. Oh. Great to meet you. - I'm... - I know. Come on. Let's move. Okay. So I guess manners aren't a priority. Staying alive is a priority. Okay. Your priorities are in order. - Where are we headed? - My safe house. And then we'll work out a plan to end this invasion once and for all. Save the world? Get this straight, kid. The world's beyond saving. Hold on. - You really believe that? - Not a belief. A fact. That's why I'm gonna lay low for a few years, wait for the aliens to finish with Earth, and move on to the next planet. And if they don't leave? Then I live out my days safely underground. There are worse fates. If you're just hiding down here, why'd you help me? Because I need something from you. Oh. I thought maybe... That I'm some kind of hero? Gee, kid, sorry to disappoint you. What do I have that you could possibly need. I've got to have enough supplies to last me years, maybe decades. The best way to do that is by raiding a secure Stark Industries warehouse. So I'm gonna need your Avengers encryption code. Well, I'm actually not a real Avenger. Though apparently, there was an internship program. But I never put together my superhero résumé. - And if I j... - Do you have the code or not? Maybe. But I'm not using it to steal from Tony Stark. Stark doesn't exist anymore. Whoa. Love what you've done with the place. Cheery. My phone? The lines have been jammed since the invasion started. Max Modell Max? You okay? Can you hear me? Boosting signal... Spider-Man... At my house... Need your help... Solution to this mess. Max? Max? There was a symbiote with him. Which means your friend's a host by now. He just said something about a solution Maybe he knows a way to stop all this Look, let's make a deal, Mr. Spector. Guide me through this maze under the city you know so well, get me to my friend Max, and I'll give you that Avengers encryption code. Clever, kid. As long as I get the code. But if we're gonna do this, then you'd better stock up. Weapons. Not exactly my thing. That costume... it's Moon Knight's. I've heard all about him. Supernatural strength and endurance. He got his powers on an ancient Egyptian dig... aah! This is a Halloween costume, kid. Moon Knight's not real. He's a myth, a lie. Does this look like a lie? Same costume. Same crescent moon dart things. You're Moon Knight. Or I could be wrong. One more word about Moon Knight, and our deal is off. Understood? You know, I feel like living in sewer-adjacent housing hasn't done wonders for your personality. Do you understand? Yeah. Now come on. Max needs me. The sooner we can get this solution Max was talking about, the sooner we can save the city and find my aunt. Why are you wasting your time betting on long shots, kid? Get smart. Find a hole to hide in and wait this whole thing out This isn't your responsibility. If I can make a difference, it is. My uncle used to say that with great power comes great responsibility. Yeah, well, your uncle was fool. Hey! He was a great man. Wait, hold it. Listen. Oh! Whew. Just rats. Why couldn't it have been just rats? Aah, aah! Oh, that thing licked me! - Aah! - Get clear! That's not gonna hold them. Move! If symbiotes are on rats, they could be on anything. Other animals, insects... Yeah, hadn't figured that one out on my own. So glad we're together. Kind of hard to convince me Moon Knight's not real when you're carrying that Egyptian doohickey. It's called an Ankh, and maybe the Moon Knight did exist, but he doesn't anymore. Then why keep the costume and the weapons? Who discards weapons? You elevate stupid questions to an art form. Let's do this quickly. Hostile target! Not hostile. Not hostile! Max! So don't shoot him? No! Spider-Man, I'm so glad to see they haven't gotten you. I wasn't sure you could hear me, and I didn't know who else could help me with the subject. The subject? You'll understand when I show you what's in my basement lab. Make it quick. Who's this guy? Moon Knig... Marc Spector. You'll have to get used to his sunny disposition. What is that? Ha! Groot! You know that thing? He's my friend. Hilarious, actually. Tons of fun. Uh, usually. Anyway, he's an alien. A different kind of alien? Did I miss another invasion? You missed a lot, sewer guy. Is Groot who I heard over the phone? He's inordinately fond of ice cream, it seems, so I used some as bait. - I've been studying him. - What for? Because that small creature represents our last, best hope. This guy's as delusional as you. Something in Groot's DNA processes the symbiotic infection at a different rate than other species... more slowly. Take a look. Groot possesses native antibodies that are resisting the contagion. I guess his tree-alien biology is giving him an advantage somehow. Clearly not enough to stop it, but if we can isolate those antibodies, enhance them... We might be able to process a kind of anti-venom, cure the infection, beat the invasion! If we can get to the Space Administration's main lab. They've developed specialized equipment there while working with the original Venom. We'll get you there, Max. - There's no "we" here, kid. - The cure... Take a look at that world out there. Even if you create a cure, how are you gonna get it to all those people? You think you're gonna beat that insanity? Grow up, will you? This hope you two idiots are looking for doesn't exist. Look, Spector, it's too risky for us to travel aboveground. You're the only one who can guide us through those tunnels. We had a deal. I take you to your friend, you give me the Avengers encryption code. I held up my end of the bargain. How about you? Moon Knight would never give up. Not when there was even a shred of hope he could win the fight. - You don't know me! - Ah! Why, you... You... You're... You're right, Marc. I don't know you. So why don't you tell me what made you take off the costume? Look... Moon Knight failed to protect someone incredibly important to him... family, his only family. And that failure broke him, taught him a hard lesson... There's no saving anybody but yourself. Heroism and ideals are for fools. All we can do is survive. You think you're the only person who's ever failed someone? My uncle, the one I told you about, he died because of me. But I didn't quit. I used his memory as a guide. Save it for your memoir. Give me the code! Hey, Spector. If you ever run into Moon Knight out there, tell him we need him. Now what? We could try going beneath the city to get to the Space Administration, but we could be wandering in those tunnels for days. That's time we don't have. So I guess we take our chances outside. Kind of cute, isn't he? Even like this. Ah! Yikes! Ah! Looks like his bite is worse than his bark. A couple trips, and I should have all the supplies I'll need to... Well played, aliens. I am not in the mood for this right now. Once you are absorbed, you will leave the pathetic limitations of humanity far behind. Not today, slimy. Aah! Keep moving. Another symbiote patrol was spotted headed this way. My supplies! We've got to go. Are you people crazy? Why are you risking your lives for a stranger? Wouldn't you do the same? I've been searching for my nephew. He's an advanced science student... The one who gave me this weapon... And he's missing. And them? We found each other and realized the only way we'll survive is to stay together. Chances are this nephew of yours has already been taken over. I'm not giving up hope. That's a weakness. No, it's our greatest strength. And even if... I never find Peter, I have this. This weapon has tremendous power. And as my husband used to say, "With great power comes great responsibility." What did you just say? My Ben... He liked to give advice. He knew that if you have the ability to help others, - you have to use it. - Yeah. I've heard that before. Ben's gone now, taken from us. There was a time when that made me want to pull away from the world, but I know he wouldn't have wanted that. He'd want me to be strong. Now... do you want to be strong, too? The Space Administration's close. Oh, no. I've been locked up in my lab for so long, I didn't realize what the city had become. All of this is because of me. Because of my Venom experiments. It's not your fault. There's no way you could've known, Max. Come on. We can still change all this. No! W-without the equipment, there's no way to process an anti-venom. Maybe we can salvage some of this. Uh... Or not. There you are, Venom-slayer. Oh, great. Aven-oms assemble. Huh? How'd you find us? My host's enchantments have tracked you. Magic is new to my kind. We travel worlds. We combine with hosts, borrow skills. But I like these powers best. Yeah, well, so does the hero they actually belong to. We are symbiotes. This is our nature. You cannot blame us, but we can blame you for destroying Venom... Our brood-kin, our hunt-brother, our family! Yah! - Ugh. - Ooh. Ah... Stay here, Max. What are you doing here? Someone told me you were just a myth. I could leave. No, no! I love myths! They're regrouping. It's gonna take more than us to hold them off. Then it's a good thing I didn't come alone. She's alive. That sonic weapon! I recognize those components. That's Space Administration tech... The same tech we were hoping to find here in the lab. We could use it on Groot... Enhance his natural antibodies. And come up with a cure. But will it work? You won't know till you try. The rest of us will hold off the symbiotes. But they need the sonic gun to... You need it more. Fire it, Max! Aah! Ooh. I am Anti-Venom! Seed pods? Of course! Groot's plant-based nature is manifesting the anti-venom that way! Ooh... Without you two, this world would be lost. We didn't do it alone. - Yeah! - Whoo! Many brave New Yorkers put themselves on the line today. I am Anti-Venom? Don't worry. We'll get you home so you can cure Star-Lord and the other Guardians. Then we'll get this anti-venom off of you. I am Anti-Venom! Hey, Web-head. Sorry if I hurt you. Let's hang out sometime and grab a muffin. Definitely. We'll hold you to that, Spidey. - Friends of yours? - I guess they are. Max? I've got to be going now. Have to make sure my nephew's all right. Let me go with you. Keep you safe. No need. My friends here have promised to see to that. But you... Did you see the way she fought those things? She'll be fine. Yeah. So I thought heroism and ideals were for fools? Then I guess I'm a bigger fool than I ever realized. You asked me earlier why I held on to the costume and the weapons. And you didn't really answer. Because I didn't really know. But I guess there was still a tiny ember of hope burning in here. And it took you and your aunt to turn it into a fire. My aunt? I don't know what... Okay. Yeah. My Aunt May's something, isn't she? So is her nephew. With great power comes great responsibility. Ben Parker really was a wise man. If you could lose someone like that and keep fighting, then so can I. Aunt May? I'm home. Peter? Oh, Peter, you're all right. Was there any doubt? It was only an alien invasion. Yeah, well... I can't say you didn't warn me. So I don't know about you, but I'm starving. Let me tell you about the night I had. Can you imagine me fighting aliens? - You'd never believe it. - Try me. Well, there were these goopy symbiote pigeons... I mean, pigeons. And then we teamed up with that hero Moon Knight. Oh, he's great. And Spider-Man was there, too. Spider-Man? Really? Yes, but maybe I should start at the beginning. Sync corrections by srjanapala
