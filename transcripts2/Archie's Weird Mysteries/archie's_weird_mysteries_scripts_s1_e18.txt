[ISLAND MUSIC PLAYING] REGGIE, BE A DEAR AND PUT SUNSCREEN ON MY BACK. SURE, RONNIE. I BET YOUR DAD PAID SOME PRETTY FAT CASH FOR THIS YACHT. MM-HMM. REGGIE, UM-- BACK OFF, JUGHEAD. I'M TRYING TO WORK A LITTLE OF MY MANTLE CHARM. SO, GORGEOUS, I'LL BET IT'S NICE BEING SO FILTHY RICH. FILTHY? YOU'RE SAYING I'M FILTHY? YOU KNOW, MANTLE, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS MORE VALUABLE THAN MONEY. OH, YEAH? NAME ONE. THAT'S EASY--FRIENDS. SPEAKING OF WHICH, ANYBODY FOR A DIVE? WHAT DO YOU SAY? WE CAN COLLECT SHELLS WHILE ARCHIE DOES HIS RESEARCH. I'D RATHER STAY HERE WITH VERONICA AND--HUH? WHATCHA YOU RESEARCHING, ARCHIEKINS? MY NEXT ARTICLE. IT'S CALLED "THE UNDERWATER MASTERMINDS." IT'S ALL ABOUT  THE MYSTERIOUS  BRAIN CORAL. MAYBE ANDREWS WILL FIND HIMSELF SOME BRAINS DOWN THERE. HUSH, REGGIE. BRING ME BACK A SOUVENIR, ARCHIEKINS, HUH? SURE, RONNIE. I'LL FIND YOU SOMETHING COOL. WHOA! [GULPS] ER, UH, RONNIE? MAYONNAISE?! UGH! GROSS! HEY! [CHEWING NOISILY] THAT STUFF GOES BETTER ON BURGERS. [GASPING] THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN THERE! ARCHIE, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST. ARE YOU OK, ARCHIEKINS? WHAT'S THIS? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S SOLID GOLD! GOLD?! AH! MWAH! YOU KNOW JUST WHAT RONNIE LIKES, DON'T YOU, ARCHIEKINS? GRR! HA HA! I'M TELLING YOU, SOMETHING OR SOMEONE IN THAT BED OF SEA GRASS WAS TRYING TO GET ME. LIKE THIS? HEH HEH! OH, ARCHIEKINS, IT WAS PROBABLY JUST A BIG FISH. NO, THIS WAS SOMETHING WEIRD. IT JUST GAVE ME THE CREEPS ALL OVER. THE CREEP'S GOT THE CREEPS. SOMEBODY IS PARANOID, AND HIS NAME STARTS WITH "A." COULD'VE BEEN AN ILLUSION CREATED BY GAS ESCAPING THAT VOLCANIC VENT ON THE OCEAN FLOOR. WE WERE DIVING RIGHT ALONG IT THE WHOLE TIME. A VOLCANIC VENT? NO, BETTY. THIS WAS SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD. [THUNDER CRACKS] UH-OH. WE'D BETTER HEAD BACK IN BEFORE OUR BUNS GET WET. OHH! OHH! Archie: MAYBE DR. BEAUMONT WILL KNOW WHERE THAT MEDALLION CAME FROM. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT? HMM. INTERESTING. I THINK I HAVE JUST THE BOOK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. SORRY. WATCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WHOA! YOU WERE SAYING? NYAH! OHH! [SNICKERING] MAYBE THAT MEDALLION WILL GIVE US A CLUE TO WHAT I SAW DOWN THERE. OH, NO. FODDER FOR ANOTHER WHACKED OUT MYSTERY--OOPS! HUH? I'LL START YOU BOYS A TAB. GOSH, RONNIE. IT'S GETTING BAD OUT THERE. I'M STARTING TO FEEL QUEASY. ARCHIE'S SUCH A SWEETIE. [BETTY SCREAMS] WHAT IS IT? EWW! SOMEONE'S LIVING IN MY SOUVENIR. I'LL HAVE TO TOSS HIM BACK IN THE WATER ON OUR WAY OUT. CAN I SEE THAT? BETTY, DON'T BREAK IT. ARCHIE GAVE ME THAT. IT'S A KEY! THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS, A KEY... TO A ROYAL TREASURE CHEST, THAT WAS STOLEN BY MURDEROUS PIRATES IN THE YEAR 1700. THEIR SHIP, THE TREASURE, AND THE KEY WERE LOST AT SEA IN A HURRICANE. AHH! IF WE COULD FIND THAT SUNKEN TREASURE, WE'D BE RICH! CORRECTION. I'D BE RICH. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PIRATES WERE CURSED BY THEIR OWN GREED. REGGIE? GUESS HE GOT SPOOKED. WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY? APPARENTLY THE PIRATES WERE FORBIDDEN FROM ENTERING THE AFTERLIFE. NOW, AS MALEVOLENT GHOULS, THEY'LL ROAM THE OCEAN FLOOR GUARDING THEIR SUNKEN TREASURE FOR ALL ETERNITY. DURING THE 1800s, THIS TREASURE WAS THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER TREASURE IN THE WORLD. BUT THE PIRATES CURSE KEPT IT SO WELL PROTECTED THAT ALL WHO SOUGHT IT... [GULP] PERISHED. [THUNDER] IT'S REALLY COMING DOWN OUT THERE. COME ON, GIRLFRIEND, LET'S GET GOING BEFORE WE HAVE TO SWIM HOME. [GASPS] I SAW SOMETHING! WHERE? OUT THE WINDOW. [GASPS AND SHUDDERS] WHAT WAS IT? I DON'T KNOW. EYES! GREEN AND GLOWING EYES! GREEN AND GLOWING EYES? LIKE WHAT ARCHIE SAID HE SAW. WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. NOW! AAH! AAH! COME ON! QUICKLY! AAH! HAR... [CACKLES] AAH! AAH! [GROWLING] AAH! AAH! OPEN! OPEN! PLEASE OPEN YOUR DOORKNOB! IT'S YOUR JOB. OUCH. [GROANING] HI. YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT MY NAME'S VERONICA LODGE. AND MY DAD HAS LOTS OF MONEY. [PUZZLED GRUNTS] [MENACING GROWLS] DON'T YOU LIKE MONEY? I'LL PAY YOU TO LEAVE US ALONE! [GASPS] OH, YEAH. WHEN I GET THAT TREASURE, I'M GONNA BUY A YACHT JUST LIKE VERONICA'S, GET A CAR JUST LIKE VERONICA'S, AND A BIG MANSION JUST LIKE VERONICA'S. HEH. THEN I'LL BUY VERONICA AND BETTY, TOO. HA HA HA HA. I'M GONNA BE SO FILTHY, STINKIN', DIRTY RICH I'M GONNA OWN ALL OF RIVERDALE. HARRR! GRRR.... GET YOUR SLIMY HANDS OFF ME! [FOOTSTEPS] OW. COME ON! AAH! REGGIE! VERONICA. I KNOW IT'S ONLY BEEN AN HOUR, BUT I'VE REALLY MISSED YOU. [GASPS] WHAT? REGGIE! GHOULS! AR-ARCHIE! WHERE'S ARCHIE? AT THAT WACKO BEAUMONT SHOP. WHY? GHOULS, REGGIE! COME ON! YAAAA! ♪ I'M GONNA BE RICHER THAN YOU ♪ HA HA HA. TWAA. LOOK OUT, FORTUNE 500, HERE I COME! [GROWLING] 500 POUNDS OF PRICELESS GOLDEN JEWELS. THAT'S A LOT OF HAMBURGERS. YOU DON'T SUPPOSE REGGIE WAS DUMB ENOUGH TO GO LOOKING FOR THAT TREASURE HIMSELF, DO YOU? HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE. NO ONE WHO SOUGHT THAT TREASURE HAS EVER COME BACK ALIVE. [THUNDER] ARCHIE! ARCHIE, WE SAW THEM, TOO. SAW WHO? YOUR GREEN-EYED GHOULS. THEY TRIED TO GET US. THEY TRIED TO TAKE MY--AAH. MY MEDALLION! I LOST IT! OH, NO! UH-OH. LET ME GUESS. YOU RAN INTO REGGIE, DIDN'T YOU? VERONICA DID. THEN I RAN INTO HER. DOWN AT THE MARINA. MANTLE! COME ON, REGGIE'S IN BIG TROUBLE. [OBJECTS SHATTERING] SOMEDAY, I'LL HAVE TO FIND A MORE CAREFUL CLIENTELE. [PANTING] OH, NO! REGGIE MUST'VE BORROWED DADDY'S YACHT! WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WE'LL TAKE MY YACHT. COME ON. YOU HAVE A YACHT? SHE'S NOT MUCH, BUT 10 MORE PAYMENTS AND SHE'S ALL MINE. [MUFFLED GROWLS] OK, LET'S TAKE A VOTE. DOES ANYONE REALLY CARE THIS MUCH ABOUT REGGIE? HMM, GOOD POINT. HEY, NOW, REGGIE MAY BE A PAIN IN THE NECK, BUT HE'S... HE'S...HE'S A... WELL, HE'S... INCREDIBLY GREEDY. COME ON, ARCH, HELP ME OUT HERE. BETTY'S RIGHT. OUR LIVES WOULD BE WAY TOO EASY WITHOUT REGGIE MANTLE. BOY, MY LIFE ESPECIALLY. YEAH, NO ONE TO TEASE YOU, OR SET YOUR HOMEWORK ON FIRE... OR HUMILIATE YOU  IN PUBLIC...OR-- JUGGIE, YOU'RE NOT HELPING. THIS ISN'T THE USUAL REGGIE BEING OBNOXIOUS THING. SOMETHING'S COME OVER HIM. THAT'S RIGHT. AND FRIENDS HELP OUT FRIENDS IN TIMES OF TROUBLE. EVEN THE GREEDY, OBNOXIOUS ONES WHO GET THEMSELVES IN MORTAL DANGER. REGGIE! REGGIE! HE'S GONE. WE NEED TO FIND HIM. WHO'S COMING WITH ME? I'LL STAY ON THE BOAT, IN CASE HE COMES BACK. JUGHEAD? OH, GEE. I JUST ATE. I COULD GET A CRAMP IF I SWIM RIGHT NOW. I'LL COME WITH YOU, ARCHIE. [CHEWING NOISILY] OH, I HAVE TO ORDER THIS DESIGNER DRESS! IT'LL BE PERFECT FOR SPRING. ALL YOU DO IS SHOP. ALL YOU DO IS EAT. 900 BUCKS! RELISH AND MAYONNAISE! YUCK! YUCK! SO! YOU'VE COME FOR THE TREASURE, HUH? NO! WE'VE COME TO SAVE YOU. THERE'S A CURSE ON THAT TREASURE. EVERYBODY WHO TRIES TO TAKE IT NEVER COMES BACK ALIVE. THAT'S A LOAD OF CRUMBCAKE. I TRIED TO TAKE IT, AND I'M STILL ALIVE. BARELY. WE CAME TO GET YOU, REGGIE. NOW, LET'S GO. OH, NO! YOU JUST CAME FOR THE TREASURE! WELL, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT! IT'S MINE! BUT, REGGIE-- WHAT WAS THAT? AN EARTHQUAKE? UNLESS I MISS MY GUESS, THE VOLCANIC CRUST AROUND HERE IS GETTING UNSTABLE. COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO GET MANTLE BACK TO THE SURFACE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S MINE, ALL MINE! AAAAAH! THE TREASURE! [GARBLED SHOUTING] I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME. I JUST COULDN'T RESIST  ALL THAT TREASURE. IT WAS THE CURSE OF GREED. MAYBE SO. BUT IF WE HAD GOTTEN THAT TREASURE, WE WOULD'VE BEEN ON EASY STREET FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY. ETERNITY, ONE OF THE MANY THINGS MONEY CAN'T BUY. [GASPS] WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT? Archie: WHEN THE TREASURE WAS DESTROYED, THE PIRATE GHOULS WERE FINALLY RELEASED FROM THE CURSE AND ABLE TO LEAVE THIS PLANE OF EXISTENCE AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. AT LEAST THAT'S MY THEORY. I THINK REGGIE REALIZED HOW CLOSE HE CAME TO BEING A GHOUL HIMSELF AND IS NOW MAKING A SINCERE, THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS EFFECTIVE, EFFORT TO QUELL HIS OWN SELFISH DESIRES. MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS, HE'LL REALIZE THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN RICHES. IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
