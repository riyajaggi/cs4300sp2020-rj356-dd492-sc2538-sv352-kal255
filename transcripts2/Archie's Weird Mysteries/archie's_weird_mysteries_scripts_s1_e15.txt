"CALVIN GIANNI AVARICCI, GENERAL MANAGER OF MALLHALLA." YOU'RE THE MALL'S MAIN MAN? INDEED. AND THAT PUTS ME IN THE UNIQUE POSITION TO HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR FINANCIAL PREDICAMENT. YOU GONNA VALIDATE OUR PARKING? HARDLY. WHAT I OFFER ARE... THESE! MALLHALLA CHARGE CARDS. GOOD AS GOLD IN ANY OF OUR FINE STORES. TAKE ONE. THEY SAY MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS, BUT THESE CARDS CAN.
