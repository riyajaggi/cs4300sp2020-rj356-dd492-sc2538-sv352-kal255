I JUST WISH FOR ONCE I COULD BEAT HIM AT SOMETHING AND MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE THE LOSER. PLEASE! SOME DAYS YOU'RE UP AND SOME DAYS YOU'RE DOWN. ONLY A REAL LOSER KEEPS REMINDING YOU OF THE SCORE. [REGGIE LAUGHING] JUST THE SAME, REGGIE BETTER ENJOY HIS VICTORY WHILE HE CAN. HUH? COME ON, GLOOMY! [SIGHS] HUH? THERE'S SOME SORT OF VIRTUAL CIRCUS DOWN BY THE MALL. VIRTUAL CIRCUS? HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THE FLYERS? COME ONE, COME ALL! I AM THE RINGMASTER AND I INVITE YOU TO SUBMERGE YOURSELF IN A COMPUTER-GENERATED WORLD SO REAL THAT YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FANTASY AND REALITY! YOU, SIR! ME? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAVE YOUR FRIENDS AND FIGHT OFF THE EVIL TROGS IN MY ACTION-PACKED VIRTUAL ADVENTURE? WHAT'S A TROG? GRUESOME, LOATHSOME, AND TROUBLESOME TERRORS FROM THE VIRTUAL WORLD.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE SOME VIRTUAL FUN? NO, I'D LIKE TO EAT SOME ACTUAL FOOD. HMM, YOU LOOK LIKE A CHURRO MAN. Jughead: I'M OPEN TO ALL DELICACIES FROM THE DEEP FRYER, THANKS. [MUNCHING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, STRAP YOURSELVES IN. Both: HUH? WHOA! LOWER YOUR HEADGEAR... Ringmaster: AND ENTER GAME GRID! HUH? [VIBRATING PULSE SOUND]WEIRD! [CLICKING] IT FEELS TOTALLY REAL. LIKE I'M ACTUALLY HOLDING SOMETHING. Ringmaster: THAT'S THE MAGIC OF MY VIRTUAL CIRCUS AND ITS GAME GRID. THE ILLUSION IS SO COMPLETE, YOU'D THINK IT WAS REALITY. AND NOW FOR THE GAME. WELCOME TO THE TROG LAIR. EVERY TIME YOU BLAST A TROG, YOU GET POINTS. EVERY TIME YOU GET BLASTED,  YOU LOSE POINTS. CAN WE BLAST EACH OTHER? WELL, YES. NOTHING CAN HARM YOU IN THE GAME GRID, BECAUSE NONE OF THIS IS REAL. HEY, ARCHIE. SLAM DUNK! AAH! HEY! I'LL GIVE YOU A SLAM DUNK. HUH? OH, YEAH! AAH! [MOANING] [GROANING] [SIGHING] Both: BOYS!

I'VE HAD ENOUGH TROG BLASTING FOR ONE NIGHT. TIRED OF LOSING TO THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPION? NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, IT WAS PRETTY RUDE THE WAY YOU KEPT BLASTING ME WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING. WELL, IF YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH, YOU WOULD HAVE BLASTED ME FIRST. SHEESH! GIRLS! [LIGHT BEEPING] IN YOUR FACE, MANTLE! I AM THE VIRTUAL KING! HAIL TO THE KING! YOU KNOW IT! YOU KNOW IT! YOU KNOW IT! IS IT MY IMAGINATION, OR IS ALL THIS WINNING GOING TO ARCHIE'S HEAD? HE'S GETTING OBNOXIOUS. Archie: FROM NOW ON, ALL LOSERS MUST ADDRESS ME AS "YOUR ROYAL KING, WINNER ARCHIE." COME TO BASK IN MY WINNER'S GLOW? NO. I THOUGHT I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT YOU'RE BEING A VERY POOR WINNER. YEAH. GEE, ARCH, EVEN I WASN'T THIS BAD WHEN I WAS WINNING. MAYBE IF YOU WEREN'T BEING SUCH POOR LOSERS, THEN YOU'D SEE THAT I'M JUST HAVING A LITTLE FUN. ARCHIE ANDREWS, YOU TAKE THAT BACK! COME TO THE GAME GRID AND MAKE ME. [KISSES] OK, I WILL. I'M GOING TO PLAY ONE MORE GAME JUST TO MAKE YOU SORRY FOR ACTING LIKE SUCH A JERK. Veronica: ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO PLAY EGO-BOY AGAIN? WE ALL ARE. ONE FINAL GAME TO TEACH ARCHIE A LESSON IN GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP. COME ON! YOU WANNABES! THE MASTER BLASTER STRIKES AGAIN! Ringmaster: UH, KIDS, I-I'M SORRY. BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE COMPUTER. ARCHIE ANDREWS. HA HA HA... HUH? VAIN LITTLE HUMAN. YOU AND YOUR KIND WILL PAY FOR TRESPASSING IN OUR REALM. [ROARS] YAAH! OOF! IS THIS PART OF THE GAME? AAH! [SCREAMS] Betty: HURRY! GET HIM OUT OF THERE! HUH? WH-WHAT'S GOING ON? SOME SORT OF MALFUNCTION. AN OVERLOAD OR SOMETHING. LOOK OUT! [ALL COUGH] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, BUT I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL. Archie: I GUESS THIS MEANS THE VIRTUAL CIRCUS IS CLOSED FOR TONIGHT. GOOD. LET'S GET BACK TO REALITY. GRR. I'M TELLING YOU, IT WAS WEIRD! HE HAD GLOWING EYES AND WAS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER TROGS. I'M SURE IT WAS JUST A GLITCH. BUT HE KNEW MY NAME. LOOK. COULD WE STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT STUPID GAME? YOU JUST THINK IT'S STUPID BECAUSE I BEAT YOUR PANTS OFF. OH, NO. HERE WE GO AGAIN! I SUPPOSE IT'S BEST WE NEVER PLAYED THAT FINAL GAME. I WOULD HAVE JUST HUMILIATED YOU ALL AGAIN. [MOANS] DID ANYBODY SEE THE MORNING PAPER? THE TOKEN ARCADE IS MISSING. Betty: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MISSING? I MEAN IT'S GONE, WITHOUT A TRACE. I SMELL A WEIRD MYSTERY! I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT. THERE'S NOTHING WEIRD ABOUT IT. THE ARCADE WAS NEAR  THE VIRTUAL CIRCUS. AND? AND MAYBE WHEN THAT COMPUTER BLEW UP, A STRAY SPARK LANDED ON THE ARCADE AND BURNED IT DOWN. Archie: THE PAPER DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT FIRE OR ASHES. EITHER WAY, IT'S WORTH A CLOSER LOOK. IT'S GONE, ALL RIGHT. YEP. IT'S GONE. NOW CAN WE GO BACK TO POP'S? I'M HUNGRY. JUGHEAD, WE WERE JUST AT POP'S! HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE HUNGRY? IT'S A GIFT, REALLY. [LAUGHS] SAY, LOOK. THE CIRCUS IS STILL HERE. I WONDER HOW THEY'RE DOING TODAY AFTER THE FIRE. HELLO! HELLO? EXCUSE ME, MR. RINGMASTER? [GASPS] I-IT'S YOU! [GROWLS] [PANTS] WHOA!OOF! JUGHEAD! I SAW HIM! HE'S IN THERE! WHO? THE RINGMASTER? NO, NO! THE BIG TROG. THE ONE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. BE CAREFUL. ARCHIE, YOU SAID HE WAS IN THE GAME. HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SEE HIM OUT HERE, IN THE REAL WORLD? I KNOW, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WELL, THERE'S NO ONE IN HERE NOW. BUT--BUT HE WAS RIGHT HERE! WHERE COULD HE HAVE GONE? NO ONE BELIEVES ME. THEY THINK I'VE GOT A VIRTUAL SCREW LOOSE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT I'LL BET THAT BIG TROG IS BEHIND IT. YOU'VE SEEN HIM, TOO, EH? [GASPS] AGH! [GASPS] THE RINGMASTER! THE BIG UGLY GUY. THE TROG LEADER. YOU'VE SEEN HIM? YES, SIR. IN THE GAME AND EARLIER TODAY POKING AROUND YOUR CIRCUS. WHO IS HE? WHAT'S GOING ON? THAT'S THE LEADER OF THE TROGS. HE WAS IN A LEVEL OF THE GAME I THOUGHT I HAD ERASED! HE SHOULDN'T EXIST. YEAH. WELL, HE DOES. AND NOT JUST IN THE GAME. I KNOW. WHEN YOU BLASTED YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS, IT OVERLOADED THE SYSTEM, ALLOWING HIM TO CREATE A DOORWAY BETWEEN THE GAMING WORLD AND OUR REALITY. WHEN I WAS TRYING TO GET THE SYSTEM BACK ONLINE... WHOA! I ACCIDENTALLY DOWNLOADED THESE INTO REALITY. Archie: THE GAME GEAR! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT EVIL TROG IS UP TO, BUT YOU'D BETTER GO WARN YOUR FRIENDS. WHAT ABOUT THE MISSING ARCADE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO... [GROWLS] LOOKS LIKE THE TROG LEADER HAS DOWNLOADED SOME PALS. I'LL DIVERT HIS ATTENTION. YOU RUN FOR IT! E-EYAHG! [GROWLS] OOF! GO! GO! GO! [TROG ROARS] OOF! [GRUNTS]EE-UH! [CRASH]OOF! GRR! [TIRES SQUEAL] [BRAKES SCREECH] [TIRES SQUEALING] [BRAKES SCREECH] Veronica: WELL. IF IT ISN'T THE KING OF THE GAMING GRID! MR. MASTER BLASTER HIMSELF. Reggie: IT'S A LITTLE EARLY FOR HALLOWEEN. I THINK SOMEONE IS GETTING A LITTLE OBSESSED WITH HIS FAVORITE GAME! [ALL GIGGLE] THIS ISN'T A GAME ANYMORE. NO, IT'S NOT, ARCHIE-KINS. IT'S EMBARRASSING, IS WHAT IT IS. LOOK. THE GAME GEAR IS REAL. THAT'S NOT ALL. THE TROG LEADER IS REALLY HERE! AND RIVERDALE'S IN TROUBLE. HE'S SO INTO WINNING THAT STUPID GAME, HE'S LOSING TOUCH  WITH REALITY. OH YEAH? THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? Betty: WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN. [RUMBLE] Jughead: LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! [GASPS]LET ME GUESS... THE TROG LEADER! WELL, WELL, WELL. IF IT ISN'T THE SMUG LITTLE HUMAN, ARCHIE ANDREWS. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM? WHY, EVERYONE KNOWS THE MIGHTY TROG SLAYER. THE MASTER FLASH BLASTER. KING OF THE VIRTUAL WORLD. WH-WHAT DID YOU DO TO OUR BUILDINGS? THE ARCADE? POP TATE'S? THEY WERE SCANNED INTO THE GAMING GRID. THE METHOD WAS PERFECTED ON YOUR ARCADE. AND NOW, ALL OF YOUR RIVERDALE WILL FOLLOW. YOU THOUGHT IT WAS FUN TO INVADE OUR REALITY? TO GLOAT ABOUT YOUR VICTORIES? WELL, NOW THE TROGS WILL RULE THIS REALITY. AND PLAY GAMES WITH YOUR LIVES FOR OUR AMUSEMENT. AND PLAY GAMES WITH YOUR LIVES FOR OUR AMUSEMENT. [GRUNTS] QUICK! SUIT UP! THEY'RE FASTER IN THE REAL WORLD. LET'S GIVE THEM A PROPER WELCOME TO RIVERDALE. AAH! GRR! SAY HELLO TO THE FASHION POLICE, YOU UGLY TROGS! Both: AAH! [TROGS SCREAMING] Both: AAH![SLAP] [CREAKING] YARG! LOOK OUT! WHOA! [CRASH] AW, MAN! MY CAR! AAH! HUH? UH-OH! HOW MANY OF MY PEOPLE DID YOU SLAY FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT? [CLANKING] YOU WERE TOO BUSY BRAGGING TO THINK ABOUT THE LOSERS IN YOUR LITTLE GAME, WEREN'T YOU? WEREN'T YOU? Y-Y-YES. NOT VERY SPORTSMANLIKE, WERE YOU? NO! NO, NOT SPORTSMANLIKE AT ALL! HUH?BUT YOU'LL BE SORRY FOR YOUR INSOLENCE. I ALREADY AM, HONEST! OH, ARE YOU? AND ARE YOU SORRY FOR BEING SUCH A JERK? YES. YES, I AM. LET ME HEAR YOU SAY IT! I'M SORRY FOR BEING SUCH A JERK. I'LL NEVER  DO IT AGAIN. PROMISE? I PROMISE. REALLY, I'LL NEVER BRAG OR GLOAT EVER AGAIN. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT! AAH!Betty: HEY, UGLY! I'M BACK! Trog: NO! YOUR BIG EGO SURE GOT US INTO MAJOR TROUBLE, ARCHIE. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED. WHERE ARE THE TROGS? BACK WHERE THEY BELONG, INSIDE THE GAME GRID. YOU CAUSED A POWER SURGE WHEN YOU ZAPPED ALL YOUR FRIENDS, ARCHIE. THAT ALLOWED THE TROGS TO ESCAPE THE PARAMETERS OF THE PROGRAM AND YOUR BOASTING MADE THEM SO ANGRY THEY DECIDED TO TAKE OVER RIVERDALE. THANKS TO YOUR FRIEND BETTY, I WAS ABLE TO GET THEM UNDER CONTROL AGAIN. THANKS TO BETTY, I'M ALIVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT. I'M SORRY I WAS SUCH A JERK! Archie: IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR BETTY, I WOULD HAVE PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR ALL MY STUPID BRAGGING. [COMPUTER KEYS CLICKING]I WON'T BE DOING THAT AGAIN. AND ONCE AGAIN, THE STREETS ARE SAFE IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
