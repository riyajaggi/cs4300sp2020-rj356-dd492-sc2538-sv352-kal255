 ♪ ARCHIE, REGGIE ♪ VERONICA, BETTY ♪ JUGHEAD, TOO ♪ WEIRD ♪ ARCHIE'S WEIRD MYSTERIES ♪ [SQUAWKS] THIS MAY BE OUR LAST CHANCE TO STOP THE INVASION. WE CAN THE INTERSTATE AND BE NEAR THE LANDING SITE IN 2 HOURS. SO WHERE'S IT HEADED? A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE. Veronica: OH, ARCHIE-KINS, THIS GOING TO BE SO ROMANTIC. A PICNIC DINNER A LOOKOUT POINT. YEP, I'VE SWORN A SOLEMN OATH TO LET NOTHING STAND IN THE WAY OF OUR HAVING A WONDERFUL EVENING. NO INTERRUPTIONS FROM BETTY, NO PRACTICAL JOKES  FROM REGGIE, AND ESPECIALLY-- HUH?[BRAKES SQUEAL] NO WEIRD MYSTERIES. WHAT IS HE DOING? UNH! UHH! OH, NO! GOOD-BYE ROMANTIC DREAM DATE! YOU'RE RIGHT, VERONICA. I TOOK A SOLEMN OATH. NOTHING SHALL DIVERT US FROM LOOKOUT POINT AND OUR PICNIC DINNER. WAIT. WHAT ISHE DOING? AND WHY IS HE DOING IT? OK, MAYBE JUST ONE LITTLE DIVERSION. OTHERWISE, WE'LL BE WONDERING ALL NIGHT. UNH! UHH! [BRICKS CLATTER] UNH! HELLO, ARCH. HELLO, VERONICA. UNH! SO, UH, JUGHEAD, UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M ON MY WAY TO POP TATE'S CHOCK'LIT SHOPPE. UNH! WELL, SURE. UH, WHAT I REALLY MEAN IS... JUGHEAD, WHY ARE YOU LUGGING ALL THESE BRICKS? HUH? UNH! LATELY, I'VE NOTICED THAT I'VE BEEN COMING HOME FROM POP TATE'S CHOCK'LIT SHOPPE ALL TIRED AND EXHAUSTED. UNH! I JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY. YOU'RE A GLUTTON AND YOU NEVER EXERCISE? EATING 20 HAMBURGERS AT ONE SITTING WOULD MAKE ANYONE SLUGGISH, JUGHEAD. UNH! I REALIZED I WAS CARRYING ALL THE EXTRA WEIGHT OF THOSE 20 BURGERS HOME WITH ME. JUGHEAD, SO WHY THE BRICKS? IF I CARRY THESE TO POP TATE'S, THEN I'LL ALREADY BE USED TO THE EXTRA WEIGHT OF ALL THOSE HAMBURGERS. BUT WHY NOT JUST EAT FEWER HAMBURGERS? THIS HARDLY CALLS FOR TAKING SUCH RIDICULOUSLY DRASTIC MEASURES, VERONICA. UNH! BUT-- NO, VERONICA! THIS COULD GO ON FOR HOURS. IT'S ALL PERFECTLY LOGICAL TO JUGHEAD, BUT NOT TO ANY OTHER BEING ON THE PLANET. BUT IF I JUST ASK ONE MORE QUESTION... IT NEVER MAKES SENSE, NO MATTER HOW MANY QUESTIONS YOU ASK. I SHOULD KNOW. I'M HIS BEST FRIEND. I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT. OF COURSE I'M RIGHT. NOW BUCKLE UP. WE'RE GOING TO LOOKOUT POINT. THAT WAS WONDERFUL, ARCHIE-KINS. MMM! YOU DON'T HAVE THEM VERY OFTEN, BUT YOU DO HAVE YOUR MOMENTS. HEH HEH! I GUESS I SHOULD BE, UH... MOMENTOUS MORE OFTEN. OHH. AND YOU WERE SO RIGHT ABOUT JUGHEAD. WE SHOULDN'T LET  ANYTHING WEIRD GET IN THE WAY OF THIS PERFECT DATE. HUH? SO IF, OH, LET'S SAY, A FLYING SAUCER HAD JUST LANDED IN THE WOODS OUTSIDE TOWN AND I WANTED TO INVESTIGATE, YOU'D BE A LITTLE VEXED WITH ME? I WOULD NEVER STOP MAKING YOU SUFFER FOR RUINING THIS PERFECT DATE. [GULPS] WELL, I GUESS IT'S A GOOD THING THERE ISN'T A UFO ABOUT TO LAND IN THE WOODS OUTSIDE RIVERDALE. I COULD STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER, ARCHIE-KINS. IT'S BLISS, ALL RIGHT. AND THEN THE UFO SWOOPED DOWN INTO THE WOODS. [CHOMPING BURGER] I'M GOING TO DRIVE BACK OUT THERE AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND. WELL, IF THIS REALLY HAPPENED... WHY DIDN'T YOU RUSH INTO THE WOODS AND INVESTIGATE WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT LAND, HMM? YES, ARCHIE. WHAT KEPT YOU FROM INVESTIGATING THIS WEIRD MYSTERY? AHEM! WELL, IT WAS NIGHT. I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE MY WAY. UH, AND THERE WERE CERTAIN SAFETY ISSUES INVOLVED. HE MEANS HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SAFE FROM VERONICA IF HE INTERRUPTED THEIR DATE TO GO CHASE SWAMP GAS. OW! HUH?! ARCHIE, YOU TOLD ME YOU NEEDED TO CATCH UP ON YOUR STUDYING. STUDYING VERONICA IN THE PALE MOONLIGHT, HE MEANT. THERE'S A PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION, BETTY. OH! AND I'M SURE I'LL THINK IT UP A FEW HOURS FROM NOW WHEN IT WON'T DO ME ANY GOOD. SO--HEH HEH-- ANYONE HEARD ANY GOOD JOKES LATELY? OH, HERE'S A GOOD ONE. HOW MANY PANCAKES CAN YOU FIT INTO A DOGHOUSE IF YOUR MOTHER IS A WASHING MACHINE AND YOUR FATHER IS A DRYER? I'LL BITE. ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT. HOW MANY? NONE! DOGHOUSES CAN'T FLY. HEH HEH HEH! I LOVE THAT JOKE. HA HA HA!  HA HA HA! THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. IT'S NOT EVEN A GOOD JOKE. OBVIOUSLY, MY HUMOR OPERATES ON A DIFFERENT PLANE FROM YOURS. JUGHEAD, YOUR  HUMOR DOESN'T  EVEN TAKE OFF FROM THE SAME AIRPORT AS EVERYONE ELSE'S. AHH! WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO WAIT AROUND HERE ALL DAY FOR AN ALIEN TO COME IN HERE AND ORDER A BURGER. [BLOWS KISS] AAH! SORRY. YOU STARTLED ME. IT'S OUR SILENT, CAT-LIKE REFLEXES. PEOPLE OFTEN FIND THEM DISCONCERTING. OUR APOLOGIES. YOU ARE ARCHIE ANDREWS? Y-Y-YES. IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU. WE DON'T NORMALLY REVEAL OURSELVES TO THE LOCAL CITIZENRY LIKE THIS. WE'RE BIG FANS. YOUR "ARCHIE'S WEIRD MYSTERIES" COLUMN IS A BIG HIT BACK AT THE AGENCY. WE READ IT EVERY WEEK. BIG FANS OF MY COLUMN? THE AGENCY? UH, WHO ARE YOU GUYS? WHERE ARE OUR MANNERS? THIS IS MY PARTNER X, AND I'M KNOWN AS Y. Y? DON'T ASK WHY, ARCHIE. JUST TELL IF YOU'VE NOTICED ANYTHING UNUSUAL AROUND TOWN. IT'S A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. YOU MEAN THE FLYING SAUCER LANDING IN THE WOODS? EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? HE'S GOOD, REALLY ON TOP OF THINGS. A FINGER-ON-THE-PULSE KIND OF LAD. THIS IS HIS HOME TURF. LET'S ENLIST HIS AID. AGREED. HIS TALENT FOR SNIFFING OUT WEIRD MYSTERIES MIGHT JUST GIVE US THE EDGE WE NEED. WE WON'T MINCE WORDS. WE BELIEVE THAT AN ADVANCE SCOUT FOR AN ALIEN INVASION IS HERE IN RIVERDALE. YOUR GOVERNMENT NEEDS YOUR HELP CAPTURING HIM BEFORE HE SENDS WORD BACK TO THE ALIEN FLEET. LOOK FOR AN INDIVIDUAL EXHIBITING UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR, SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T FIT IN. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME. WE'LL... STAY IN TOUCH. OHH! WHOA! AN ADVANCE SCOUT FOR AN ALIEN INVASION I BETTER KEEP MY EYES PEELED. HUH? AHH! GOTTA STAY EXTRA VIGILANT. THERE'S NO TELLING WHO MIGHT BE THAT ALIEN SCOUT. OOF! UNH! HUH? ANYTHING TO REPORT? NO. EVERYTHING SEEMS PRETTY NORMAL IN RIVERDALE. LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING. WE BELIEVE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE ALIEN DOUBLE AGENT. WE'LL NEED A LOCAL SCIENTIFIC FACILITY TO EXAMINE HIM ONCE WE MAKE THE CAPTURE. THERE'S A SCIENCE LAB AT RIVERDALE HIGH. WILL THAT DO? THAT SHOULD SUFFICE. SO WHO'S THE ALIEN? THE ALIEN'S GONE UNDERCOVER AS A RIVERDALE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. IN FACT, WE'RE SURPRISED YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED THE ALIEN YOURSELF. IT'S SO OBVIOUS. IS IT OLGA KARPUCCI? SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE STRANGE. NO. THIS ALIEN DOUBLE AGENT HAS CAREFULLY SIMULATED AN OUTWARD HUMAN APPEARANCE. BUT HIS TOTAL IGNORANCE OF NORMAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR HAS GIVEN HIM AWAY. THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS GIVES YOUR AVERAGE ALIEN DOUBLE AGENT AWAY. THEIR ARROGANT REFUSAL TO LEARN HOW TO ACT LIKE NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS. I KNOW, IT'S THAT WEIRD SWENLIN KID. HE'S ALWAYS GIGGLING TO HIMSELF IN THE BACK OF THE CLASS. [GURGLES AND LAUGHS] I KNEW THAT WOULD CHEER YOU UP, LITTLE DECKLIN. HEY, THERE'S ARCHIE! SO WHO IS IT? WHO'S THE ALIEN DOUBLE AGENT? HERE HE COMES NOW. ACT NATURAL. HI, ARCHIE! QUICK! HE'S ATTEMPTING AN ALIEN SHOULDER-HAND MELD. NOW WE HAVE YOU, ALIEN SCUM! ALIEN SCUM? BUT I SHOWER EVERY OTHER WEEK. JUGHEAD? AN ALIEN? YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE. WE DON'T MAKE MISTAKES. THIS SUPPOSED TEENAGER IS REALLY AN ALIEN DOUBLE AGENT. ABSOLUTELY. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. HE CAN'T BE AN ALIEN! I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE GRADE SCHOOL. GENTLEMEN, I HAVE TO CONCUR WITH ARCHIE. WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH YOU CONCUR WHEN YOU'RE FORCED TO SERVE GRAPE SODAS WEARING A TUTU TO AN ENTIRE ALIEN OCCUPATION FORCE. OH! COULD I HAVE A GRAPE SODA? SEE? HE CAN'T EVEN WAIT FOR THE INVASION TO BEGIN BEFORE HE STARTS ORDERING MANKIND AROUND. WHILE INITIAL EVIDENCE SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT JUGHEAD MIGHT BE AN ALIEN, CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT HE IS ALMOST AS HUMAN AS YOU OR I. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEOTAPE BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY SNAP JUDGEMENTS. VERY WELL. OH, NO. HUH? NOTICE THE ALIEN DOUBLE AGENT'S INABILITY TO SIMULATE ANYTHING REMOTELY SIMILAR TO NORMAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR. Agent Y: NOTICE THAT THE ALIEN DOUBLE AGENT WEARS CLOTHES THAT ARE YEARS OUT OF DATE AND WEREN'T EVEN FASHIONABLE WHEN THEY WERE IN STYLE. CLOSE SURVEILLANCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE SUBJECT SLEEPS AN AVERAGE OF 18 HOURS A DAY, MORE ON WEEKENDS. OBVIOUSLY, THE SLEEP CYCLES ON HIS HOME PLANET ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM OURS. BUT THE MOST COMPELLING EVIDENCE IS... HIS EATING HABITS. WE ESTIMATE THE SUBJECT INGESTS OVER 40,000 CALORIES A DAY AND NEVER EXERCISES. YET HE NEVER GAINS A POUND, WHICH, PERSONALLY, I RESENT. HIS ALIEN METABOLISM MUST BE BURNING CALORIES LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. BUT THAT ONLY PROVES THAT JUGHEAD IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S AN ALIEN. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS UNDENIABLE PROOF THAT JUGHEAD IS AN ECCENTRIC TEENAGER, NOTHING ELSE. YOU TWO WILL SING A DIFFERENT TUNE AFTER WE CRACK HIS COVER WITH OUR ALIEN INTERROGATION. ALL RIGHT, YOU, SPILL THE BEANS. WHEN IS THE ALIEN INVASION ARRIVING? [SNORING] HE'S A COOL ONE. HIS ARROGANT CONFIDENCE AND CAUSAL CONTEMPT FOR MANKIND WILL BE HIS UNDOING. ARE YOU REALLY SURE THESE ARE GOVERNMENT AGENTS? RIGHT NOW, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I'M REALLY SURE OF. WHAT'S THAT? I'VE GOT TO FIND  THE REALALIEN BEFORE THEY DO SOMETHING DRASTIC TO JUGHEAD. NOW, IF I WERE AN ALIEN, WHERE WOULD I LAND IN THE WOODS? OK, ARCHIE ANDREWS, JUST REMEMBER, THIS IS FOR JUGHEAD. LET'S HOPE I'M NOT TRACKING A NICE FRIENDLY EARTH BEAR. AAH! CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF VISITORS FROM THE STARS! MAN IS NOT ALONE. ALL THESE YEARS OF WAITING AND HOPING. AND I FORGOT MY CAMERA AT HOME. SO WHAT DO I DO NOW, KNOCK? AND WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY? "EXCUSE ME, ALIEN SIR, "I HATE TO INTERRUPT YOUR INVASION, "BUT, PLEASE, COULD YOU VISIT MY HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB "AND CONVINCE SOME GOVERNMENT AGENTS MY BEST FRIEND ISN'T AN ALIEN?" [YAWNS] OH, ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER PRIMITIVE PLANET EVALUATED. IF I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS, I WOULD NEVER HAVE SIGNED UP TO JOIN THE SILBERKLITE SPACE FLEET IN THE FIRST PLACE. BETTER SEND MY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SPACE FLEET-- WHA-- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! WELL, HUMAN, SHOULD I MENTION THAT MY SPECIES EVOLVED OUT OF THE FETCHING INSTINCT MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO? NONE OF YOUR DOUBLE-TALK, ALIEN! YOU TRY TO SIGNAL YOUR INVASION FLEET, AND I'LL KNOCK THAT THING FROM YOUR HANDS. INVASION FLEET? HEAVENS, YOU HAVE ME ALL WRONG! WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO CONQUER EARTH. YOU SURE? I AM COMMANDER SIRIUS. I'VE BEEN SENT HERE TO EVALUATE WHETHER YOUR CIVILIZATION IS WORTHY OF JOINING THE SILBERKLITE GALACTIC EMPIRE. PHEW! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A RELIEF THAT IS! I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ADVANCED SCOUT FOR AN INVASION FLEET. HEH HEH HEH! IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE. HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WE'RE NOT INVADING EARTH. WHAT EXCITING TIMES. SO WHEN ARE WE GONNA JOIN THE GALACTIC EMPIRE? SADLY, YOUR EARTH CIVILIZATION ISN'T REALLY GALACTIC EMPIRE MATERIAL. WHICH IS WHY I'M ORDERING THE COMPLETE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PLANET EARTH. WHAT?! WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO ORDER THE DESTRUCTION OF EARTH? HELLO. COMMANDER SIRIUS HERE. PUT ME THROUGH TO THE FLEET COMMANDER, PLEASE. [VOICE ON LINE]YES, I'LL WAIT. YOUR EARTH CIVILIZATION IS TOO BORING TO BE ALLOWED TO SURVIVE. EVERYTHING HERE IS SO MUCH ALIKE. BORING ARE WE, HUH? WELL, LET'S JUST SEE HOW BORING THIS IS! I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND GET X AND Y  TO HELP ME. YOU'RE ONLY DELAYING THE INEVITABLE! "JOIN THE SILBERKLITE SPACE FLEET," THE RECRUITMENT POSTER SAID. "MEET EXCITING NEW RACES!" YEAH, RIGHT! UGH! I NEED TO KNOW. WHAT'S ARCHIE GOT THAT MAKES WOMEN THINK HE'S SO HOT? WELL, HE HAS A SORT OF SENSIBLE, DOWN-TO-EARTH QUALITY ABOUT HIM. HUH? OHH! NO TIME TO TALK! EARTH ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED! I HAVE TO GET THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENTS WHO ARE HOLDING JUGHEAD IN DILTON'S LAB BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S AN ALIEN BEFORE THE REALALIEN  CATCHES ME! [INHALES DEEPLY] UH, BUT ARCHIE ALSO HAS THIS WILD, SPONTANEOUS, UNEXPECTED SIDE TO HIM. I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WOMEN. ALL RIGHT, ALIEN IMPOSTER, TELL US ABOUT THE WEAKNESS OF YOUR INVASION FLEET. AND THEN TELL US YOUR SECRET OF EATING SO MUCH WITHOUT GAINING WEIGHT. I'M JUST A GROWING BOY! DID YOU FIND THE REAL ALIEN? YES! IT'S WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. HE'S GOING TO ORDER THE DESTRUCTION OF EARTH WITH THIS DEVICE. DID YOU REALLY EXPECT TO FOOL US WITH SUCH AN OBVIOUS TRICK? IT'S JUST AN ORDINARY TELEVISION REMOTE CONTROL. THEN YOU WON'T MIND GIVING IT BACK TO ME. BUT WE THOUGHT HE WAS THE ALIEN. YES, THIS IS COMMANDER SIRIUS. COMMENCE THE DESTRUCTION OF PLANET EARTH! THERE GOES THE PENSION PLAN. OH, AND I'M STUCK IN TOWN. SEND SOMEONE TO PICK ME UP BEFORE YOU START THE DESTRUCTION. [VOICE ON COMMUNICATOR] SO, MY RIDE'S COMING IN ABOUT AN HOUR. ANYTHING WORTH SEEING OR DOING IN RIVERDALE BEFORE IT'S DESTROYED FOREVER? I KNOW THE BEST PLACE TO SPEND OUR LAST REMAINING MINUTES. Sirius: THIS ISN'T HALF-BAD. IT TASTES LIKE KLODERSNARK. ENTRANCINGLY DELICIOUS! [BOTH CHOMPING] IT DOES HAVE A SATISFYING FLAVOR, DOESN'T IT? POP TATE, ANOTHER ROUND OF BURGERS FOR ME AND MY FRIEND! YOU KIDS AND YOUR HALLOWEEN COSTUMES. THEY'RE GETTING MORE AND MORE REALISTIC EVERY YEAR! THERE'S ONLY A FEW MINUTES LEFT. WE'VE GOT TO CONVINCE HIM NOT TO DESTROY THE EARTH. THE TIME FOR TALK IS PAST. T'S TIME TO KICK ALIEN FANNY. HUH? HA HA HA! AH, THE PERSONAL SELF-PROTECTION FORCE FIELD. DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT. [SPACESHIPS WHIRRING] WELL, HERE'S MY RIDE. IT'S BEEN NICE SHARING THESE HAMBURGERS WITH YOU, JUGHEAD. ALWAYS GLAD TO PARTAKE OF THE BUNS AND BEEF WITH. THANKS FOR NOT HOLDING THE DESTRUCTION OF YOUR PLANET AGAINST ME. YOU KNOW ME, I HAVE A SORT OF TAKE-LIFE-AS-IT-COMES- TO-YOU PHILOSOPHY. REFRESHING. IF THERE WERE MORE UNUSUAL PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON THIS PLANET, WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO ANNIHILATE IT. DON'T DO THIS. YOU'LL BE DESTROYING SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS, VAN GOGH'S STARRY NIGHT, BEETHOVEN'S 9th SYMPHONY. SORRY, KID. ALL THAT CULTURE HAS TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING. HA! YOU HUMANS CAN'T EVEN TELL A GOOD JOKE. UM, I KNOW A GOOD JOKE. NOT NOW, JUGHEAD. THERE'S ONLY A FEW SECONDS TO CONVINCE HIM NOT TO DESTROY THE EARTH. HUH? OHH! AHEM. HOW MANY PANCAKES CAN YOU FIT INTO A DOGHOUSE IF YOUR MOTHER IS A WASHING MACHINE AND YOUR FATHER IS A DRYER? THE PLANET IS DOOMED! NONE. DOGHOUSES CAN'T FLY. HEH HEH HEH. [LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] DOGHOUSES CAN'T FLY! WHOO! THAT HAS TO BE THE FUNNIEST JOKE I'VE HEARD IN OVER 12 KLUMPFRACKS. YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY? HEH! OH, COMMANDER SIRIUS HERE. CALL OFF THE DESTRUCTION. YOU CULTURE MAY NOT BE READY TO JOIN THE GALACTIC EMPIRE, BUT IF IT CAN PRODUCE AN ORIGINAL COMIC GENIUS LIKE JUGHEAD, THERE MIGHT BE HOPE FOR IT IN A 100,000 YEARS. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. YOUR JOKE SAVED THE PLANET EARTH. WHAT CAN I SAY, ARCH? THE UNIVERSE IS A MYSTERIOUS PLACE. A TRULY IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY OF ANTI-GRAVITY PRINCIPLES. YOUR GOVERNMENT OWES YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE, AND WE PERSONALLY OWE YOU AN APOLOGY FOR INTERROGATING YOU MERCILESSLY. IRONICALLY, THE STRANGE, ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOR THAT WE THOUGHT WAS EVIDENCE OF YOUR NON-HUMANNESS WAS THE VERY THING THAT SAVED HUMANITY. WE'RE...ASHAMED. FORGET IT. IT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME. Archie, voice over: SO EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL BE NO PARADES OR MEDALS OR ANY PUBLIC RECOGNITION THAT HE SAVED EARTH, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER TO JUGHEAD. I GUESS THAT'S ANOTHER WAY HE'S DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF US. AS FOR AGENTS X AND Y, WE NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN, BUT EVERY SATURDAY, POP TATE NOW RECEIVES A GOVERNMENT CHECK MATCHING THE EXACT AMOUNT OF JUGHEAD'S WEEKLY TAB. COINCIDENCE? I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT. NOT IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
