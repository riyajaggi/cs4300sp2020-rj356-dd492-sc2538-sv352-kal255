 ♪ VERONICA, BETTY ♪ JUGHEAD, TOO ♪ WEIRD ♪ ARCHIE'S WEIRD MYSTERIES THIS EARTH SPECIMEN YOU FOUND IS WORTHLESS! OOH! SORRY, COMMANDER, SIR. WE'VE TESTED AND ANALYZED HIS BRAIN, BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE AN OUNCE OF VITAL DATA ABOUT THIS PLANET. ALL HE EVER THINKS ABOUT IS OUTER SPACE! THAT'S 'CAUSE IT'S THE FINAL FRONTIER. TAKE ME TO A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY, OK? SILENCE, YOU! CLEAR HIS BRAIN AND SEND HIM BACK. AT ONCE, YOUR LOUDNESS. DON'T SEND ME BACK! RIVERDALE IS BORING. LET ME STAY WITH YOU GUYS. SPACE IS COOL! NO! DON'T WIPE MY MIND! I WANT TO REMEMBER ALL THIS. WHAT IF THE FBI WANTS TO OPEN A FILE ON ME? AAH! AAH! OOF! [WHINES] [SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE] Commander: NEXT TIME, FIND ME A REAL EARTHLING! Alien: OOH! YES, YOUR IRRITABLENESS. SO ANYWAY, MY UNCLE SAID WE CAN ALL GO UP TO HIS CABIN NEXT WEEKEND AND GO WATER-SKIING. WATER-SKIING IS FOR WIMPS. DID I EVER TELL YOU HOW I SNOW SKIED DOWN K2 ON ONLY ONE SKI? [YAWNS] NOT IN THE LAST HOUR. YEAH, REGGIE, WHAT'S THE IDEA OF CUTTING OFF BETTY'S INVITATION WITH THAT BIG, FAT LIE? JUST TRYING TO SPICE UP YOUR BORING LITTLE LIVES. HEY, LOOK, EVERYONE! MY NEW DRESS! WHAT A DEAL I GOT! AN EVENING GOWN WITH ORIGINAL HALTON TAGS, FOR ONLY $20! IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! HUH? WHAT'S THIS? HA HA HA! IT HAS HALTON TAGS, ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU'LL NEVER FIT IN IT. YOU MEAN I WAS CHEATED? WAKE UP AND SMELL THE RIP-OFF. IF SOMETHING SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT IS! HA HA HA! OK. SO VERONICA FELL FOR A SCAM. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO POINT OUT EVERYONE'S MISTAKES? BECAUSE I'M BETTER THAN EVERYONE. HEY, LOOK, SOMEBODY LEFT SOME MONEY. REGGIE MANTLE, THAT'S THE WAITRESS' TIP, AND I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TAKE IT. OK, OK. SHEESH. WHY IS EVERYONE SO DOWN ON ME TODAY? BECAUSE YOU'RE BOASTFUL AND SELF-CENTERED. LOUD AND INSENSITIVE. PUSHY AND CHEAP. PRETENTIOUS AND CRUDE. MOI? YES! YOU ARE OBNOXIOUS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S OBNOXIOUS. LISTENING TO ARCHIE'S DUMB STORIES ABOUT VAMPIRES AND LITTLE GREEN MEN. ONLY WEAK-MINDED GEEKS BELIEVE THAT HOGWASH. GUESS WHAT, ARCHIE? LAST NIGHT, I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS! I REST MY CASE. CATCH YOU LOSERS LATER! REGGIE MANTLE HAS LEFT THE BUILDING. HE SUFFERS FROM TERMINAL JERKYOSSITUDE. ABDUCTED BY ALIENS? PUH! WHAT A BUNCH OF LAME-OS. HUH. IF I EVER SAW AN ALIEN, I'D KICK HIS GREEN BACKSIDE UP AROUND HIS POINTY EARS. [WHIRRING] HUH? Commander: FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE NOT GREEN! AND SECONDLY, WE DO NOT HAVE BACKSIDES. YAHH! L-LOOK, YOU DON'T WANT ME. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN THIS SCIENCE-FICTION JUNK, LIKE ARCHIE? DO I LOOK LIKE FICTION TO YOU? NO, NO. I MEANT I, UH, JUST WANT TO COOPERATE. YEAH. GO AHEAD AND ASK ME ANYTHING. I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING. MY NAME, RANK, SERIAL NUMBER, LOCKER COMBINATION, WEATHER FORECAST, THE SQUARE ROOT OF PI, AND THE WHITE HOUSE TELEPHONE NUMBER. STRAP THE SPECIMEN DOWN AND WE WILL BEGIN THE BRAIN VACUUM. BRAIN VACUUM?! I'M OUT OF HERE! YAHH! DID YOU SEE HOW THIS EARTHLING WAS WILLING TO DESTROY HIMSELF TO KEEP US FROM GETTING HIS INFORMATION? Alien: OH, YES. HE MUST BE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE, INDEED. IT'LL TAKE WEEKS TO SUCK HIS BRAIN DRY. WEEKS? LISTEN, YOU JOKERS, I'M A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON ON EARTH. I WILL BE MISSED  INSTANTLY. REGGIE WAS REALLY MEAN TO ME. DO YOU THINK I SHOULD INVITE HIM TO MY BEACH PARTY? REGGIE WHO? YOU WAIT UNTIL MY FRIENDS FIND ME MISSING. THEY'LL CALL THE ARMY, THE NAVY, AND THE AIR FORCE. THEY'LL BLOW YOUR SHIP TO SMITHEREENS. HMM. THIS CREATURE IS RIGHT. HIS ABSENCE COULD AROUSE SUSPICION. AND OUR MISSION ON EARTH WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY. THIS LEAVES US ONLY ONE CHOICE. RETURN ME TO EARTH? EXACTLY.REALLY? WELL, NOT YOU, OF COURSE, BUT SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU. NUMBER 2, MAKE A DROID CLONE OF THIS EARTHLING. I SHALL BE IN MY SLEEP CHAMBER. I LIVE TO OBEY, YOUR DROWSINESS. WE'LL START WITH THE BASIC FORM. HMM. THE BX-29? NO, IT'S SUMMER. I THINK THE TR-4. THAT WOULD NEVER FOOL MY FRIENDS. IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE ME. THAT IS BECAUSE THE OUTER LAYER HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED YET. HUH? [MOANING] NOW, FOR THE LATEX SKIN. HEY! WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? THIS FEELS WEIRD! KNOCK IT OFF! YAHH! AAH... OOF! HANDSOME DEVIL, ISN'T HE? NOW, I MUST PROGRAM IN YOUR PERSONALITY TRAITS. ON A SCALE OF ONE TO 10, 10 BEING THE BEST, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR KINDNESS? KINDNESS? A 10, EASY. SELFISHNESS? ZERO. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? ABSOLUTELY. HELPFULNESS? 11.5. [YAWNS] SO, HOW IS OUR DROID CLONE COMING ALONG? PROJECT COMPLETE, SIR. THE EARTH CAPTIVE WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL. WE NOW HAVE AN EXACT REPLICA. NO ONE ON EARTH WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE. [WHIRRING] Commander: THERE'S A GOOD SPOT TO LAND! WE CAN HIDE OUR SHIP IN THAT STRUCTURE WHILE WE INTERROGATE THE EARTH SPECIMEN. GO NOW, MINGLE WITH THE EARTHLINGS, AND SHOW THEM THAT EVERYTHING IS THE SAME AS BEFORE. AN EXCELLENT PLAN, SIR, AND MAY I ADD WHAT A FINE JOB NUMBER 2 DID IN PARKING THE SHIP. AW, SHUCKS, IT WAS NOTHING. HAVE A NICE DAY! DON'T LOOK NOW, BUT THE EGOMANIAC IS BACK. All: AWW. WHAT A DELIGHT TO SEE YOU. [THINKING] IDENTIFICATION CONFIRMED. BETTY COOPER. SUGGESTED RESPONSE TOPIC: MOVIES. SO, BETTY, HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW ZEFFIRELLI FILM? I THINK HIS CINEMATIC APPROACH TO THE HUMAN CONDITION REFLECTS YOUR POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON LIFE. I RECOMMEND IT.HUH? [THINKING] VERONICA LODGE. SUGGESTED TOPIC: CLOTHING. [ALOUD] VERONICA, WHAT AN AMAZINGLY ATTRACTIVE DRESS! IS IT NEW? YES. I JUST BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY. YOU REALLY LIKE IT? IT'S YOU. [THINKING] JUGHEAD JONES. SUGGESTED TOPIC: FOOT. SORRY, MISPRINT.  FOOD. [ALOUD] JUGHEAD, MY COMPADRE. WAIT, WHAT'S THIS? YOUR PLATE IS ALMOST EMPTY? POP, 6 MORE HAMBURGERS FOR MY PAL JUGHEAD. ON ME.All: HUH? YOU MEAN IT? THANKS, REGGIE. AND ARCHIE, MY FRIEND. I READ YOUR LATEST WEIRD MYSTERY. WHAT AN INSPIRED PIECE! A STERLING JOB OF WORDSMITHING. REALLY? THANKS. I WORKED HARD ON THAT ONE. HOLD ON A SECOND. WHAT'S WITH THIS NICE GUY APPROACH, REGGIE? ARE YOU UP TO SOMETHING? NOT AT ALL. I JUST REALIZED HOW MUCH I LIKE ALL OF YOU, AND HOW I DON'T SHOW YOU THAT OFTEN ENOUGH. ESPECIALLY YOU 2 LOVELY LADIES. WOULD YOU HONOR ME BY LETTING ME ESCORT YOU TO DINNER TONIGHT? [KISSES] WHAT A GENTLEMAN! WE'D LOVE TO GO! WHAT? YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH THIS STUCK-UP, SELFISH DOPE? HE'S NOT BEING STUCK-UP NOW. YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO TREAT A LADY. JUGHEAD, THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON HERE. THIS CAN'T BE THE REAL REGGIE MANTLE. IT MUST BE A CLONE. A REPLICANT OR SOMETHING. WOW! ARCHIE, YOU'VE BEEN READING YOUR OWN ARTICLES TO MUCH! MAYBE REGGIE JUST TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF. LEAF? THIS GUY TURNED OVER A WHOLE TREE! [MUNCHING] WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY HE CHANGED, BUT I, FOR ONE, LIKE IT. WELL, I'M GOING TO PROVE THIS IS A PHONY. REGGIE, QUICK. WHO WON THE WORLD SERIES IN 1947? GOLLY, I DON'T KNOW, ARCHIE, BUT I'LL GO TO THE LIBRARY AND LOOK IT UP FOR YOU IF YOU WANT. AHA! GOTCHA! YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. NEITHER DO I, ARCH. NOR ME. UH-UH. HUH? YOU'VE STUMPED US ALL, ARCHIE. WHY DON'T YOU TELL US THE ANSWER? UH... I DON'T KNOW, EITHER. THIS IS  A WEIRD MYSTERY. THAT THING IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. DON'T BELIEVE HIM. HE'S NOT REGGIE MANTLE, AND I'M GOING TO PROVE IT. AND AFTER WE GET SOME ICE CREAM, I'LL COME OVER AND MOW YOUR LAWN FOR YOU. I'VE GOT YOU NOW, YOU FREAK! [BOTH GASP] [CLANG] SEE, BETTY, SEE? THIS ISN'T REGGIE. IT'S A METALLIC DROID. REGGIE, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? WELL, I GUESS THE SURPRISE IS RUINED NOW. I KNOW HOW YOU LIKE TO BAKE COOKIES, SO I BOUGHT YOU THIS NEW BAKING SHEET. OH, YOU SWEETHEART! MWA! ARCHIE, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. STOP ACTING SO PETTY AND VINDICTIVE. I'LL GET THE GOODS ON HIM YET. WHAT DO YOU SAY I TREAT YOU EACH TO A NEW CD PLAYER? COOL! I'LL SHORT OUT YOUR CIRCUIT, YOU ELECTRONIC NIGHTMARE! [THINKING] DANGER. SUSPECT WITH WATER. OOPS! SHOELACE UNTIED. [SPUTTERING] ARCHIE ANDREWS, WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU? WHY ARE YOU SO BLIND? CAN'T YOU SEE THIS ISN'T THE REAL REGGIE? ARCHIE, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ACCEPT THAT REGGIE HAS HAD A CHANGE OF HEART? 'CAUSE HE HAS NO HEART! [TRUCK HORN]HUH? [GASPS] WHOA! OOF! WHOA, REGGIE, YOU SAVED MY LIFE! I GUESS I WAS  WRONG ABOUT YOU. I'M REALLY SORRY I WAS--[GASPS] NO, NO. THINK NOTHING OF IT. AND HAVE I MENTIONED WHAT A HANDSOME JACKET THAT IS? HOLY COSMIC MUFFINS! ARCHIE WAS RIGHT! THIS REGGIE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! WE'VE GOT TO TELL BETTY. UH, COME WITH US, REGGIE. YOU'VE GOT A SMALL, UH, SCRAPE. NO, NO, DON'T TOUCH IT. BETTY KNOWS FIRST AID. SHE'LL MAKE YOU GOOD AS NEW. LET'S HOPE SHE HAS BAND-AIDS AND AN OIL CAN. Betty: UH, DON'T WORRY, REGGIE. YOUR CUTS AND BRUISES WILL BE FINE IN NO TIME. THANKS, BETTY. I GUESS I GOT A NASTY BUMP. YOU KNOW, REGGIE, I THINK IT WOULD BE FUN IF WE ALL DID SOMETHING INTERESTING THIS AFTERNOON. COULD YOU HELP US WITH THAT? SURE, ARCHIE. JUST ASK ME ANYTHING. WELL, WE WERE ALL SAYING, "WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF WE COULD VISIT, OH, A FLYING SAUCER THIS AFTERNOON?" RIGHT? All: YEAH! A FLYING SAUCER. WONDERFUL. I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT. THERE'S ONE PARKED NOT FAR FROM HERE. SWELL! COME ON, GUYS. IT'S RIGHT IN HERE. WAIT! HEY, I KNOW, REGGIE. LET'S PRETEND WE'RE ON A SECRET MISSION. AND WE HAVE TO BE REALLY QUIET AND REALLY CAREFUL, OK? OK! [WHISPERING] I mean, OK. Yipes, all get out. A real spaceship! How do we get inside it? AFTER YOU. HUH? I WANT MY MOMMY. I WANT MY MOMMY! Archie: PSST! REGGIE! ARCHIE, IT'S YOU! SAVE ME! SHH! CLAM UP. YOU WANT TO GET US ALL CAPTURED? UNH! SOMEONE'S COMING! GET ME OUT OF HERE! THIS READOUT REVEALS NO IMPORTANT DATA, BUT I SENSE THIS EARTHLING IS HIDING SOMETHING. UP THE VOLTAGE! AYE, AYE, SIR. [BABBLING] BUT I DON'T LIKE BUTTERSCOTCH COOKIES, GRANDMA. THAT LOOKED LIKE FUN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? MY FRIENDS AND I ARE PRETENDING WE'RE ON A SECRET MISSION, SO I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE HIDING OVER THERE. RUN! PERSIST AND DECEASE! UH, WHATEVER. [ALL GASP] WELL, WELL... WHAT HAVE WE HERE? INTRUDERS, HUH? FRIENDS OF THIS EARTHLING, NO DOUBT. LOOK, SIR, WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE. WE JUST WANT TO GET OUR BUDDY OUT OF HERE. OH, YOU HAVE GOT TROUBLE, ALL RIGHT. TOO MANY EARTHLINGS KNOW ABOUT OUR MISSION NOW. THINGS ARE GETTING TOO HOT. [GULPS] I MUST GET INSTRUCTIONS FROM HOME BASE. [MUMBLING] GET REGGIE LOOSE WHILE I DISTRACT THE OTHER ONE. GREAT LITTLE SHIP YOU'VE GOT HERE. HOW MUCH HORSEPOWER HAVE  YOU GOT UNDER THE HOOD? WHAT'S A HORSE? IT'S A BEAST OF BURDEN. HERE, I'LL DRAW YOU A PICTURE OF ONE. VERY WELL, OH, SUPREME ONE. IT SHALL BE DONE AT ONCE... HUH?! GET UP, YOU FOOL! WHILE YOU'RE DOODLING, OUR SPECIMEN IS GETTING AWAY! DON'T LET THEM GET ME AGAIN! HA HA HA HA. RESISTANCE IS USELESS. YOU'LL BE COMING WITH US TO OUR PLANET WHILE WE LEAVE BEHIND THE DROID AND YOUR FRIENDS. WHAT GOOD WILL THE DROID DO ON EARTH? SIMPLE. HE HAS A BOMB INSIDE HIM. WHEN WE LEAVE HERE IN A FEW MINUTES, YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE WORTHLESS TOWN WILL BE BLOWN OFF THE MAP! [ALL GASP] INCLUDING MY TENNIS COURT? YES! NOW, YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS LEAVE THIS SHIP. WAIT! HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH REGGIE IS THE REAL REGGIE? SIMPLE. THE DROID IS NICE, AND THIS ONE IS AN OBNOXIOUS, SELF-CENTERED, PETTY LITTLE CREEP. HEY, WATCH WHO YOU'RE CALLING LITTLE. OW! YEAH, BUT WHAT IF BOTH REGGIES WERE NICE? THEN THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. BUT I WOULD SIMPLY USE A SCANNER TO SEE WHICH ONE HAD THE METAL SKELETON. WELL, SURE. ANYONE COULD DO THAT, BUT IT WOULD TAKE A REAL MAN--UH, ALIEN-- TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH WITHOUT MACHINES. WHAT?! ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY ABILITIES? VERY WELL. I WILL PICK THE REAL REGGIE, USING ONLY MY EYES AND EARS. ALL RIGHT. SINCE THE DROID IS THE NICER OF THE 2, I SUGGEST A LITTLE NICE CONTEST. IS THIS REALLY WISE, YOUR WISENESS? WATCH ME OUTWIT THESE SIMPLE-MINDED EARTHLINGS. ARCHIE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE NICE. WELL, YOU'D BETTER LEARN FAST, BECAUSE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. UH, HI. ISN'T IT A LOVELY DAY? YES. I THINK IT'S A LOVELY DAY, TOO. STAND HERE, WHERE I'M NOT BLOCKING YOUR LIGHT. NO, NO. I INSIST. YOU TAKE THE GOOD SPOT. THE FATE OF RIVERDALE WILL BE DECIDED ON WHETHER REGGIE CAN OUT-NICE THAT DROID. WE'RE DOOMED. HAVE FAITH. ADMIT IT. I'M THE NICEST. NO. I'M THE NICEST. I'M NICEST.I'M NICEST. I'M CONFUSED. LOOK, I'M TOO MUCH OF A GENTLEMAN TO ARGUE WITH YOU. SO I'VE ONLY GOT ONE LAST THING TO SAY. [WHISPERING] ARGH! THERE, TAKE THAT! OOF! OHH. GEE, PAL, YOU OK? I HOPE I DIDN'T HURT YOUR FIST. THAT'S THE DROID! NOW, GET OFF MY SHIP! All: NO, DON'T! STOP, PLEASE! ALL RIGHT. I'LL STAY BEHIND AND BLOW UP THE TOWN NOW. BYE-BYE. [WHIRRING] GREAT. THEY TOOK THE REAL REGGIE, AND WE'RE STUCK WITH THIS WALKING TIME BOMB. [WHIRRING] HA HA HA. THOSE FOOLS THOUGHT THEY COULD OUTWIT ME. HA! TIE THE EARTHLING DOWN AGAIN, AND LET'S PROBE HIS MIND SOME MORE. I LIKE TO HEAR HIM SCREAM. OH, DON'T BOTHER. I CAN TIE MYSELF DOWN. YOU'RE MUCH TOO BUSY FOR SUCH SUCH MENIAL TASKS. GEE, WHAT A HELPFUL GUY. YOU MEAN, YOU'RE THE DROID?! 30 SECONDS TO DETONATION. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO FIX SOME SNACKS WHILE WE'RE WAITING? RUN FOR THE ESCAPE POD! NOW WHAT DO WE DO? HEY! RELAX! THE REAL REGGIE IS HERE AND LIFE IS GOOD. HOW DID YOU WIN THE NICE CONTEST? WHAT GIVES? IS IT REALLY YOU?WHAT HAPPENED? SIMPLE. I JUST WHISPERED TO THE DROID, "IF YOU WERE REALLY THE NICEST, YOU'D LET ME WIN," AND HE DID. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, REGGIE. YOU ACTUALLY PROVED THAT YOU CAN BE A NICE GUY. YEAH. IT WAS THE TOUGHEST MINUTE OF MY LIFE. HAVE A NICE TRIP HOME, BOYS. [WHOOSH] WHAT WILL I TELL THE SUPREME ONE? [BOTH GASP] TELL HIM, "HAVE A NICE DAY!" [WHOOSH] Archie: AND SO, AN ENTIRE TOWN WAS SAVED BY THE TEMPORARY NICENESS OF REGGIE MANTLE. IT WAS NICE TO SEE THE CHANGE, EVEN IF ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES. AND WE ALL LEARNED THAT IF SOMETHING SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS... IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
