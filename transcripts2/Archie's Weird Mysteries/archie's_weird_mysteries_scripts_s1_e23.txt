 Archie's Weird Mysteries (1999–2000): Season 1, Episode 23 - Dream Girl - full transcript 
 Archie has a series of extremely pleasant dreams about a beautiful girl who adores him. It turns out that the girl is a supernatural being who actually lives in - and controls - peoples' dreams. She has a major crush on Archie and doesn't want to share him with anyone else. She even warns Betty and Veronica, in their dreams, to stay away from him. When Archie makes the mistake of refusing to go steady with her, his dreams turn into surreal nightmares. Archie must find a way to mollify his scorned "dream girl" or he'll never be able to get a good night's sleep again.

 ♪ WEIRD ♪ ARCHIE'S WEIRD MYSTERIES ♪ [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] GREETINGS, ALL. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE NOBEL PRIZE COMMITTEE FOR AWARDING ME THIS YEAR'S NOBEL PRIZE FOR FASHION. [SNIFFS] TO THINK THAT A GREAT CELEBRITY LIKE VERONICA SPENT HER FORMATIVE YEARS IN OUR LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL. [GASPS] [SNIFFS] I'M SO PROUD. [SLOPPY HONK] OH! HUH? AS YOU CAN SEE, MY DESIGN IS ELEGANT, BEAUTIFUL, AND REVOLUTIONARY. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT MY DESIGN STARTED A FASHION CRAZE THAT IS SWEEPING THE ENTIRE WORLD! Sinister voice: VERONICA LODGE, YOUR DOOM IS NEAR! WHO'S TRYING TO RUIN MY MOMENT OF TRIUMPH? ONE OF MY JEALOUS FASHION DESIGN COMPETITORS? AAH! KEEP BACK! LEAVE ME ALONE! VERONICA LODGE, YOUR DOOM IS NEAR! [VOICE GROWLS] AAH! NO! NO! NO! [GASPS] ANOTHER NIGHTMARE! I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. [BELL RINGING] JUGHEAD, WHERE WERE YOU AT LUNCH? I WAITED AT OUR USUAL TABLE. I WAS DOING RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY. I'M DOING MY ORAL PRESENTATION ON THE HISTORY OF THE HAMBURGER NEXT WEEK. BUT--BUT I EXPECTED YOU TO BE THERE. DON'T WE ALWAYS MEET FOR LUNCH? NOT ALWAYS. SORRY, ARCH, IF YOU WANTED TO GET TOGETHER, YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED. WELL, IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO INCONVENIENCE ME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP A SCHEDULE. YOU CAN'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT I'LL ALWAYS DO THE SAME THINGS EVERY DAY. I GUESS. OH, NO! HEY, VERONICA, LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR DATE TONIGHT? I HOPE YOU PICKED OUT SOMETHING NICE TO WEAR. [GULPS] OUR DATE? TONIGHT?! UM, BUT THIS IS SUCH SHORT NOTICE. WE ALWAYS GO OUT ON FRIDAYS. WE CAN'T VERY WELL  GO OUT ON SATURDAY. THAT'S MY NIGHT WITH BETTY. SAY...YOU LOOK AWFUL. I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING WELL. WELL, GET PLENTY OF REST THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE THERE'S A HONG KONG FUN FU MOVIE DOUBLE-FEATURE AT THE BIJOU TONIGHT. HYAH! IT'S GONNA BE GREAT! I CAN'T GO OUT WITH YOU TONIGHT. HUH? IN FACT, I--I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE. [CRYING] GOOD-BYE FOREVER. HUH?! THAT WAS CERTAINLY MELODRAMATIC. WHY IS VERONICA DOING THIS? WE ALWAYS GO OUT FRIDAY NIGHTS. WHAT WILL I DO? WATCH THOSE KARATE FILMS ALONE? HMM...IF VERONICA WON'T GO OUT WITH ME ANYMORE, I'LL JUST START TAKING BETTY OUT FRIDAYS ANDSATURDAY NIGHTS.

STUDENTS, DILTON DOILEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT HIS NEXT SCIENCE PROJECT. Dilton: THANK YOU, MISS GRUNDY. DREAMS. FOR AGES, MANKIND HAS PONDERED THE MYSTERY OF WHAT DREAMS REALLY ARE. ARE THEY JUST FIGMENTS OF OUR SLEEPING IMAGINATIONS, OR DO OUR DREAMS OCCUR IN ANOTHER DIMENSION JUST AS REAL AS OUR OWN? DOES THAT MEAN I OWE POP TATE FOR ALL  THE HAMBURGERS  I ATE IN MY DREAMS? I PLAN TO EXPLORE THE MYSTERIES OF DREAMS WITH MY NEW INVENTION-- THE DREAM-MONITORING HELMET. I NEED A VOLUNTEER TO HELP ME. OH, OH. PICK ME. PICK ME! GOOD. IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE MY VOLUNTEER. HUH?THIS'LL BE GREAT, DIL.

[GASPS] WHY ME? MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE A BETTER DAY. BOY, IT'S JUST NOT FAIR THE WAY VERONICA TREATED ME. AND BETTY AND HER STUPID TUTORING! NOTHING GOES MY WAY. [SNORING] [WIND WHISTLING] BOY, IT SURE IS QUIET IN TOWN TODAY. I DON'T WANT TO GET MY SHOES WET. WHOA! WOW! I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD DO THAT. WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

[YAWNS] MAYBE THIS IS ALL JUST SOME BAD DREAM, AND I'LL WAKE UP AND EVERYTHING WILL BE BACK TO-- [YAWNS] TO NORMAL. [SNORING] Archie: A LITTLE LOWER. LOWER. AHH... THAT'S THE SPOT. THOSE OTHER ROTTEN GIRLS DON'T ADORE YOU THE WAY I DO, ARCHIE. HUH? BUT I LIKE BETTY AND VERONICA. A LITTLE HIGHER THERE. AHH... BUT YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND NOW, AND I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE IN YOUR DREAMS. YOU DON'T NEED THOSE OTHER GIRLS. BUT YOU'RE NOT A REAL GIRL. ONLY A DREAM. YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU IN ONE OF YOUR DREAMS, I KNEW THAT YOU AND I WERE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER, SO I DUMPED MY BOYFRIEND, BEGAN SCARING OFF BETTY AND VERONICA, AND STARTED TO SEND YOU THE NICEST DREAMS. ALL I ASK IN RETURN IS A LITTLE APPRECIATION. IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK FOR?! OH, NOW I'M REALLY ANGRY! HUH? WHAT'S GOING ON? AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, HANG IN THERE. WE'LL GET YOU FIXED UP. UHH...WAA...BUH... [GASPS] ARCHIE! HI, BETTY. CAN'T TALK WITH YOU, OR SHE'LL PUNISH ME AGAIN. HE HASN'T SLEPT IN OVER 60 HOURS.

MAYBE YOU AND VERONICA SHOULD COME ALONG. Betty: AND THAT'S OUR STORY, HARD THOUGH IT MAY BE TO BELIEVE. CAN YOU HELP US? THIS JUST CONFIRMS WHAT MY RESEARCH WITH BIG ETHEL HAS FOUND. THE DREAM REALM EXISTS IN ANOTHER DIMENSION, AND OUR DREAM SELVES GO THERE WHEN WE SLEEP. BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS MARIA NACHT PERSON WHO KEPT SHOWING UP IN BETTY AND MY DREAMS UNTIL WE LEFT ARCHIE ALONE? [YAWNS] UH, YEAH. WHO IS SHE? MY MONITORING HAS DETECTED INDEPENDENT LIFE FORMS IN A DREAM REALM. AAH! Dilton: THIS CREATURE, ARNIE, IS ONE OF THEM. [CREATURE HOWLING] LEAVE ME ALONE, YOU BIG MEANIE! UNH! AAH! THIS MARIA NACHT IS PROBABLY ANOTHER ONE OF THESE LIFE FORMS. SADLY, I HAVE NOT FOUND A WAY TO PREVENT THEM FROM TRESPASSING IN OUR DREAMS YET. MAYBE IF YOU HOOKED US ALL TOGETHER IN THE SAME DREAM, WE COULD GANG UP ON MARIA AND SCARE HER OFF. I'VE GOT ENOUGH SPARE DREAM HELMETS IF YOU WANT TO TRY. ANYTHING TO HELP MY PAL! I'VE GOT TO MAKE IT UP TO ARCHIE FOR ACTING SO COWARDLY AND MEAN TOWARDS HIM. YOU'LL DO THIS FOR ME AFTER I TOOK YOU FOR GRANTED SO MUCH? YOU GUYS ARE [YAWNS] GREAT FRIENDS. Dilton: I'LL BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU WHILE YOU'RE IN THE DREAM REALM WITH THIS DEVICE. GET READY. WHEN I PUSH THIS BUTTON YOU'LL ALL ENTER A DEEP SLEEP STATE. [SNORING] EH...I MEAN, JOIN ARCHIE IN A DEEP SLEEP STATE. [BEEP] IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING. [SNORING] CAN YOU HEAR ME? ARE YOU IN THE DREAM REALM? [SQUAWKING] YES. WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME DREAM. AND I DON'T FEEL TIRED ANYMORE. Dilton, over radio: THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED. YOUR DREAM SELF DOESN'T NEED SLEEP. NOW SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THIS MARIA NACHT GIRL. I--I THINK SHE'S FOUND US. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THESE GIRLS, ARCHIE?! I THOUGHT YOU FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU'RE MINE NOW! FORGET IT, MARIA! WE'RE STANDING UP TO YOU! YEAH. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU RUIN ARCHIE'S DREAMS ANYMORE. Jughead: YOU CAN'T FRIGHTEN US. [GASPS] SURE, I CAN. I'LL JUST SEND YOU INTO A NIGHTMARE OF YOUR WORST FEARS! WHOA! AAH! AAH! NO CREDIT CARDS! OH, NO! SHE TURNED ME INTO A POOR PERSON! DADDY, HELP! WELL, BETTY, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE DID ANYTHING TO YOU. OH, MY GOD. IT'S SO HARD TO THINK. SHE MADE ME, LIKE, TOTALLY-- OH, WHAT'S THE WORD?

YOU SEE, ARCHIE DEAR, I DECIDED I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOUR FRIENDS WAKE UP UNTIL YOU AGREE  TO STAY HERE WITH ME  FOREVER. THAT'S ROTTEN! LOOK, YOU CAN EITHER STAY WITH ME AND BE THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND I ALWAYS WANTED, OR YOUR FRIENDS CAN STAY TRAPPED IN THEIR WORST NIGHTMARES FOREVER! THE CHOICE IS YOURS. YOU WIN.

AND I'M BACK TO MY RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE FOOD CHAIN AS A DEVOURER OF HAMBURGERS. I'M GOING TO STAY HERE WITH MARIA SO SHE'LL LET YOU WAKE UP. I'M GOING TO MISS YOU. SORRY I TOOK YOU ALL FOR GRANTED. SAY YOUR GOOD-BYES AND WRAP THIS UP, ARCHIE. SAY, DILTON, IF BIG ETHEL IS STILL ASLEEP OUT THERE, HOW ABOUT HOOKING HER INTO THIS DREAM SO I CAN SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER?

HE'S AN EVEN BIGGER NIGHTMARE THAN YOU! MARIA. ARNIE? UH, YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER? ARNIE WAS MY OLD BOYFRIEND. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? NOT A CLUE. WE'VE FOUND IT BEST IN THESE SORT OF SITUATIONS TO KEEP OUR MOUTHS SHUT UNTIL AFTER ALL THE MONSTERS GO AWAY. THEN ARCHIE EXPLAINS IT ALL TO US. TAKE ME BACK, BABY. DOIN' THE NIGHTMARE THING JUST ISN'T THE SAME WITHOUT YOU. YOU'RE THE BEST! OH, PLEASE! THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE DREAMIN' OF TAHITI RIGHT NOW. LET'S GO SCARE 'EM.

UHH... AHH. AH! Archie, thinking: BOY, I WAS REALLY TAKING BETTY, VERONICA, AND JUGHEAD FOR GRANTED AND ACTING LIKE I WAS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. WHY THEY PUT UP WITH ME, I DON'T KNOW. BUT WHEN I DID THE SAME THING TO MARIA NACHT, IT LANDED ME IN HOT WATER. AND IT WAS THE SAME FRIENDS I TOOK FOR GRANTED THAT HELPED ME GET OUT OF TROUBLE. NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL GOOD FRIENDS. [YAWNS] WELL, I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GET ANOTHER GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP... IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED RIVERDALE.
