 You're on probation, Stafford. Previously on "Betrayal"... - Brandy is no good for you. - I'm gonna marry her. The best thing would be for that girl to disappear from both our lives! [ Knock on door ] Brandy, are you home? You lying coward! You... I've met someone. - What does that mean? - It means he's cheating on mom. - Get out! - OLIVER: Mommy? Don't let him see this, okay?

 - Mommy? - Oliver. Let's not be alone tonight. [ Sighs ] - Hey. - Hey. It's 4:00 a.m. I know. I've been up since 2:00. I was afraid I'd oversleep. [ Sighs ] - Oliver won't be awake for hours. - I know. - Come back to bed. - Mm. What we've done here is not a small thing. [ Sighs ] No. Oliver, Vic, Val. [ Sighs ] It's gonna change their lives forever.

 It's gonna become part of who they are. I know it might seem impossible, but... I really think that one day they'll understand. [ Sighs ] They won't. [ Sighs ] [ Shivers ] [ Sighs ] Maybe they'll grow up believing that... happiness is worth fighting for, worth changing for. I like that. Say it again. Really? No. [ Laughs softly ] Just tell me we're not ruining their lives. We'll be there for them. We'll love them more than anything. That's... That's what matters. And that's what'll get us through this. Oh, I should go. [ Sighs ] It's dark outside. Let me... Let me walk you to the car. Mm. I love you. I like that. Say it again. [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] [ Bells tolling ] [ Knock on window ] [ Sighs ] I talked to my guys at the morgue. The Korskaya case is closed. What, that she drowned? In a tub? Overdose. It's not so surprising. These girls all get messed up in the end. So, you cops don't think someone might've killed her. Not that I've heard. Do you? She had a little girl... Amy. Did they find the father yet? Mnh-mnh, no record of the guy. Girl's in the system. They're looking for a permanent home, but that'll take some time, you know. People aren't exactly looking to adopt some dead hooker's kid. Watch your mouth. So, uh, McAllister ain't working for you anymore? I mean, I hope you don't mind me asking. I just thought he was, you know, family. Actually, I do mind. Are we done? [ Car door closes ] I didn't hear you come in. I packed Oliver's lunch. Thanks. There's some coffee. I'll get some at the office. This is hard, I know. Hard? Wow. Hey, honey. - Mm, you ever get to sleep? - Mm-hmm. You want to play jenga while I make breakfast? No. Okay. You want some oatmeal? I got to run. I got an early meeting. - Bye, buddy. - Wait! What about mommy? Oh, daddy's in a hurry. Kiss mommy goodbye. Have a good day. No. A real kiss. Like in a wedding. [ Chuckles softly ] [ Sighs ] 1.08 - ...One More Shot Sync and corrected by Elderfel www.addic7ed.com Welcome back to work. It's good to see you here, son. I don't want to move into Jack's office today. Yeah, sure, I understand. I don't think Brandy wanted to die. She wanted to take care of Amy. Sometimes it's hard to know what goes on inside someone's head. Maybe, but sometimes it isn't. T.J... I know it must've been awful finding her like that. Try not to dwell on it. Okay? [ Doorbell buzzing ] - Sara Hanley? - Nate Greene? That's me. The reporter from New York? Precisely. - Y-you want to come in? - Yeah. Oh, man! My apartment is the size of your bed! Oh! Is it worth it, really, living in Manhattan? You know what? Don't answer that. I'll just get depressed, and when I get depressed, I have to lie in bed blowing Mithril on Hobbit armies of the Third Age. You have a band-aid by any chance? New sneakers. Sure. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] So, I really like your article on that hypocrite C.E.O. - Michael Boyd? - Yeah. - What a douche! - [ Chuckles ] Your pictures were crazy good. You got an eye for sadism. That's a compliment. Thanks. Ah, Buzz Lightyear. How old's your kid? He'll be seven in a month. Does he live here with you? No, his, uh, dad and I... - it's kind of complicated right now. - Oh, yeah. My parents got divorced when I was nine. Sucked at first, but then it became strangely awesome. Two birthday parties. So, I know you didn't come all the way here for a band-aid. Here it is. You know all those foreclosures from the crash? Homeless families in the south side are using boarded-up houses for shelter. They're getting ousted by real-estate developers, rousted by city officials, flousted by cops. "Flousted" isn't a word, but... [ Snaps fingers ] My intel says things are going down in Auburn Gresham right now. It's heavy! These people have no rights. I want us to tell their story. Aren't you gonna get your camera? Oh, I-I don't know. I-I booked this job on... home beekeeping. Hanley, you're wasting your talents! Take a risk! Get messy. [ Door opens ] ZAREK: Thatcher. You wanted to see me? Brandy Korskaya. Drowned in her bathtub. Under the influence. How does that happen? I guess it was a convenient tragedy. So you figured it out all by yourself to show some initiative. Is that it? Yeah. I knew what you wanted. You were wrong. I did what needed to be done. You don't decide that... ever! I watched you when I was a kid. What I am, I learned it from you. You killed a mother. You made her child an orphan. What do I tell my son? From now on, you do exactly what I tell you and nothing else, you understand? Now get out. [ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] Is there a code word? DREW: What? This bench thing is neat. [Sighs] Very "Three Days of the Condor." I'm sorry. Who are you? The queen of France. And you? - Drew Stafford. - Drew Stafford. I knew it. Quincy Theringer. I was supposed to meet Serena. She quit 'cause you annoyed her so much. Not really. I mean, you did annoy her, but that's not why she quit. - Well, what, then? - Her house burned down. Her granny died. She broke her toe. I'm really not at liberty to say. - Okay, Ms. Theringer. - No one calls me that. Okay, Quincy. -You're the head of the task force now? - Affirmative. So you know about the Lou Mrozek case? The case is closed. Your C.I. O.D.'d in the tub. Yeah, I don't believe that. I spent some time with her. That girl was clean. You look pretty clean yourself. Ever known a drug addict? Don't answer that. They're professional liars. Will you just [sighs] look at this, please? It's T.J. Karsten's Impala. It was parked at the garage where Lil' D was... Who? Darius Miller... The kid they're saying shot Lou Mrozek. He worked at the garage. His boss told me that Lil' D found Mrozek's .38 in a car. Now, if I can get him to admit the car in question was indeed T.J.'s Impala, well, it's what I thought all along. Karsten family killed one of their own. It's a murder. Go tell your murder people. I can't. Howard Goss doesn't want to hear this from me. He thinks I'm crazy. Well, I'm sure when you show Mr. Goss a clipping of an antique-car auction, - he'll revise his opinion of you. - Just ask Serena. I may have annoyed her, but she and I had... Serena is gone. This is a murder case. Take it up with your office, Lil' Drew. SARA: Hi. What are you wearing... I mean, doing? I'm wearing what I always wear, and I am packing up lenses. Are you nervous about your meeting? I shouldn't be. I went to law school with this guy. He's a big deal now. His firm's one of Karsten Allied's biggest rivals, so could be a good fit. You sound hopeful. I like that. How about you? You're, uh, off to shoot some home beekeeping? Uh, actually, no. Something interesting came up. More interesting that domesticated bees? I don't want to jinx it. I'll tell you about it later. Look, I wish we could have dinner, but I-I got my, uh, kids' birthday tonight, so... Well, I'll be thinking about you. I'm always thinking about you. Look, son, I understand what you're going through. I do, really. But everyone experiences loss. I went through it when I was your age. And I survived. If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger? Yeah, yeah, something like that. What does that even mean? ♪ I may get weary ♪ ♪ Women do get weary ♪ ♪ Wearing the same shabby dress ♪ ♪ But when I'm weary ♪ ♪ Try a little ♪ ♪ Try a little tenderness ♪ [ Feedback squealing ] What in the hell?! I am so sorry, Miss Dumond. Okay, yeah, how are you gonna fix it, huh? Oh, I don't know. Maybe if I do this. Mmm. ANGELO: Suzanne? I'm tired of pretending. But some people won't understand. I don't care. I love you. Suzanne?! Get back to work. Hey, kid. I don't know what you're up to, but get on out. - You're fired. - [ Sighs ] T.J.: Dad? - Dad?! - Hmm? I don't want to work here anymore. - T.J.! - I want to live on my own. - That's not practical. - It is. Some things I haven't done because you told me not to, but I can do stuff! I want to see a new doctor about changing my meds. T.J., I know you're in pain. But don't use that as an excuse to blow up your whole life. [ Knock on door ] Just a minute! Keep working here. Live with me. It'll get better. I promise. The truth is, I-I'm ready for a change. Yeah, so are we. I think our firm could be a great fit for you. All right. That's great 'cause, you know, I've got a lot of experience with land use, permitting, entitlements, commercial leasing, - some litigation, too. - Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Are we speaking in code here? - Code? - [ Laughs ] Jack... When I said we were interested in your particular skill set, I meant that we were looking for someone to come in and help us grease the unions, you know, bend the E.P.A. on our wetlands project. - You want a fixer. - Right. We just need you to do what you do, man. [ Cellphone beeping ] Oh, sorry. I got to run. All right, here. Take a look at this. And we'll be in touch. - All right, great catching up, man. - All right, thanks. [ Siren wailing ] [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Wailing continues ] Back off, back off! [ Shouting continues ] Okay, team, here's the plan. I'm gonna try and get a statement while you... Document the flousting. It's risky, but you got to take risk by the balls! Just...kill it! Kill the risk! That's the weirdest pep talk ever. [ Shouting continues ] You stop! Move back! [ Camera shutter clicks ] You got to be kidding me! [ Shouting continues ] [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Shouting continues ] [ Camera shutter clicking ] [ Shouting continues ] Stay back! No pictures! [ Camera shutter clicks ] Okay, that's it! Let go! - Let go! - Nate Greene! This is my colleague, Sara Hanley! Yeah, well, you're both under arrest! - Obstruction of justice! - SARA: We're not obstructing anything! We have a right to be here! You have the right to remain silent! You should use that, huh? You know a good lawyer? Actually, I know two. T.J.: Ah, what an amazing day! [ Rock music playing ] VIC: Yeah! I mean, look at the sky! I'm so psyched that we came out here today! Happy birthday, nephew! Hey, I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to have booze with your pills. No. [ Sighs ] I'm not on my pills! [ Music continues ] No, I-I-I'm tired of anything holding me back! From now on, anything that holds me back, I don't have time for! Is that okay? I mean, what'd the doctor say? It's fine! Look, things are gonna change. They're gonna get better! It's good! It is! It is! I'm in the clear! Don't be worried. Now, come on, I-I picked you up to bring you out here to have a good time on your birthday! Now let's have some fun! [ Music continues ] [ Shouts ] We weren't doing anything, Jack! They arrested us for just standing there. - Just standing there with a camera. - Is that a crime? No, nein, nyet. Should we file a complaint? Ne... That's Bulgarian. Yes, I'll file a complaint. - Good, I'll go back, get more shots. - That's my girl! It's nice to meet you, Nate. Hey, thanks for bailing us out. - I'll call you with our next move. - What next move? Forget about the bees, Hanley. You're an outlaw now. You all right? Yeah, I [sighs] I just can't stop thinking about this little boy. He was barely Oliver's age. You seem energized, motivated. [ Sighs ] I'm kind of jealous, actually. Your meeting didn't go well? [ Sighs ] No, I was naive to think I could get a legit job in Chicago. Hey, you can start again, do something else. Let's go. I'll buy you a drink. I wish, but I-I got this birthday party. I hope they'll let me in. They'll be happy to see you. Hey. Did you ever think you'd have to bail me out of jail? Let's give you a lift, outlaw. That's it for now. [ Indistinct talking ] [ Sighs ] I'm sorry about before... Our misunderstanding. I want to make it up to you. I know... I know we need the unions to raise their estimates on the Streeterville project, right? So we can pad the budget before your big meeting with the investors. What does that have to do with you? I can deal with the union, be a liaison. I can learn to do the stuff the way Jack did, how you need it. I came to you so you would sign off. I'll keep you informed every step of the way. Give me another shot. [ Piano music playing ] THATCHER: Give me another shot, Angelo. - I won't screw up again. - All right. No more lazing around. No more... fraternizing with the talent. - I-I never... - Shut up! - Want the job back or not? - Yeah, I need it. All right, then. Keep your eyes down and your mouth shut. - We'll see how it goes. - SUZANNE: Yeah. Hey, kid... I see you look at that colored girl again... I'm gonna stick you with this. You got it? Okay. One more shot. Did you have fun in art class? We made masks. Mine is red with blue stripes, like a tiger. I can't wait to see it. Ollie... Did you take this? What sound does a giraffe make? Oliver, did you... Did you take these from school? I won't be mad. [ Barking ] It's a giraffe dog. Um, okay, well... Have you been worried about anything? Something on your mind? What is it, honey? I had a bad dream. I called you, but you didn't come. Oh. Did daddy come? Uh-huh. But I wanted you. Where were you, mommy? Daddy didn't tell me. Hey, Jack. Hey. What are you doing here? I drove Thatcher over. Congratulations. Your kids are practically adults. Yeah. I could use a little advice, if you don't mind. I got to meet with a union rep about the Streeterville budget. I reached out to Dibinsky. He gave me the brush-off. Who else can I talk to? I don't know. I don't really care anymore. We've had our disagreements. But we're still family, right? We can't let the old man down. Just because you're, you know, in the situation you are, it don't mean you should abandon him. I'm sorry. You're on your own. [ Gate rattles ] I cleaned everything up for you, Jack. For you and for T.J. What are you talking about? Don't pretend like you don't know how it is. Someone had to get rid of that girl. [ Door closes ] I didn't know you were coming. Well, it's their birthday. Of course I was gonna come. Yeah, but you can't just show up. You have to let me know. I called a few times. You don't live here anymore. [ Sighs ] It's my house, too. No, it isn't. It really isn't. You need an engineer to open a bottle of wine around here. Jack. Thatcher. Hard to believe the kids are 17 now. You're feeling nostalgic, gramps? Where are the kids? Vic is on his way here with T.J., and Val is upstairs raiding my closet. I guess you're stuck with us. - Hey, birthday girl. - Oh, hi, dad. I didn't think you were coming. I wouldn't miss it. I was waiting for you downstairs. Guess I got distracted. - Uh, I got this for you. - Thanks. I'm going to the club with Jules later. Which one? [ Chuckles ] I remember you used to play this game with me when you were little, maybe 9 or 10 years old. Except the clothes actually fit now. Yeah, they do. Dad, are you okay? Yeah, I was just... thinking back. I can't imagine you being with anyone but mom. You're never coming back, are you? [ Door opens ] T.J.: [ Laughing ] Oh, yeah, all right! Have you been drinking? - No. - I have. I didn't let him drive. He offered me some. I didn't take it. T.J., you know you shouldn't drink with your meds. - I'm not on my meds. - For how long? [ Laughs ] Who... Who knows? Should we get him some coffee? ELAINE: He might need more than coffee. The room is spinning here. Come on, sit down. - I'm gonna sit down. - Yeah. Val! Happy birthday! It's gonna be awesome! [ Door closes ] He's asleep. I heard about the arrest today. The booking officer gave me a call. I was going to tell you. I was covering a story. Forget it. None of my business. Ollie had a bad dream, and he wanted to know where I was. Well, I considered telling him you had an affair. Drew, please. He senses something's wrong. He stole stuff from school. - He what? - School supplies. He won't look at me. He won't talk to me. He's anxious. He's not himself. I don't know what to do. You should've thought of that before. Drew, listen to me. He knows. We have to talk to him. T.J.'s sleeping it off. I'm sorry. It's not your fault, baby. [ Chuckles ] Awesome birthday, right? Okay, you two, let's, uh, go in the kitchen and have some cake. Hey, uh, I got this for you. Keep it. I don't need anything from you. [ Chuckles ] Teenagers... It's never easy. I remember when T.J. was his age. Why is T.J. off his meds? How should I know? He's upset...about a lot of things. Your situation doesn't help any. That's not what this is about, Thatcher. We both know what it is. You did it, didn't you? You had that girl killed. And why would I do that? You thought she'd turned on us. I didn't think it, Jack. She did. So you admit it? I don't admit to anything. And you know what? You either work for me or you don't, and right now, you don't. So this is none of your business. You walked away from this family. I gave you everything, and what did you do? You pissed it all away! For what? Some other guy's wife? With a family of her own. Your pathetic midlife crisis. We're not talking about me now. No, we're not. We're talking about me because I know that life is complicated. I apologize for nothing. [ Door opens ] [ Indistinct talking ] You've had too many drinks, Angelo. Stop, please! [ Grunts ] Stop, please! Angelo, stop! [ Gasps ] - No, please! - Get off her! Get out of here! - I warned you! - Don't! It's okay! Just leave us alone! Angelo, no, don't hurt him! [ Grunting ] Unh! [ Knife clatters ] - Listen to me... - Ohh! - It's okay! Just go! - Easy, kid! - Don't! It's okay! Please just go! - Take it easy! - Just walk away. - Never touch her again! Say it! - Say it! - I'm begging you... I'll never touch... that whore...again. No... - Unh! - Aah! [ Crying ] Unh! [ Crying continues ] [ Crying ] No! [ Crying continues ] Whatever Zarek did... that's on you. You set it into motion. We all make mistakes, Jack. Only some of them are redeemable. [ Sighs ] SARA: Grown-ups sometimes need some time away from each other. [ Sniffles ] So we came up with this plan that I'm gonna spend some nights at my studio, and then other nights, I'm gonna be here with you. And that way, we both get to spend a lot of time with you. Okay? And this has nothing to do with you. It's nothing you did. Okay? Mommy and I will... will always be your parents, and we'll always be a family. - We love you so much. - We love you so much, honey. You're the most important thing in the world to us, Ollie. Do you understand? Is there anything you want to say? I stole some things from my classroom. I'm sorry.

I changed my name. Thatcher Karsten. Seems more respectable. I like your old name better. They're selling this place. I might head to Detroit. You know, that's where it's really happening now, so... No, you got to stay here. Some guys from the old neighborhood... they're starting a jazz label. I could get you a record deal. No, I... I don't want your help. - Suzanne... - I saw something in you! - A rage, and I don't want that in my life. - Please! No, a-are you at least sorry that you did it? No, I'm not sorry! - Theo... - I did it for you! Theo, no, you did it for yourself! - Suzanne... - I got to go. Suzanne!

He was so tiny and helpless, and I was so scared. But you knew what to do. [ Chuckles softly ] This makes no sense. We've been good together. We loved each other. I think...we still do. - Yeah, of course. - Let's just try again. Can we? I mean, not just for Oliver's sake but for all of us. You made a mistake. We can get over it. I can get over it. I know I haven't been the best husband. - Drew, please... - No, you're right. I took you for granted, and for that, I am...so sorry. But I can be better. Just... Let's try again. I love you. [ Sighs ] You... Can't you hear what I'm saying? Yeah, uh, yeah. It's... It's just, um... [ Sighs ] It's so hard to talk about. [ Sighs ] It's just... It's not a casual thing. I have feelings... Don't say any more. I get it. You're done. You're just done. Thanks for bringing me in on this, Thatch. [ Chuckles ] Here's what's happening. I told this importer we'd meet him here. There's a big shipment of steel coming in. This guy is giving me a hard time. So I, uh, I need you to work with him, if you know what I mean. - [ Chuckles ] This I can handle. - Yeah. You know, I've also been talking with the union. [ Chuckles ] It's just like Jack says... You're not Jack. And you never will be. [ Choking ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] Oh, Sara. Come back to bed. Oliver needs a mother. [ Sniffles ] Not half time, all the time. How can I be so selfish? [ Sighs ] You're not being selfish. It's different for you. Your kids are grown up. Oliver's six. You'll still be his mother e-every moment of every day. [ Sniffles ] Oh, we can tell ourselves that, but [sniffles] I'm afraid. I'm afraid he'll never be happy. I just want him to be happy. I just want him to be happy. [ Sighing ] [ Sniffles ] DREW: Hey, bud. What are you drawing? Me, mommy, and you. Mm. That's awesome. I especially like my fluffy hair. [ Chuckles ] In the picture you need a haircut. [ Chuckles ] You know, when I was a kid, some things happened that were hard for me. Sometimes I was a little scared. Did grandma ever have to sleep at her studio? Not exactly, but she had to raise us kids on her own. 'Cause your dad went away. That's right. - Where did he go? - I don't know. He had some big problems. Just left. And grandma had to work... really hard. And sometimes I wished things weren't the way they were, but you know what? What? Everybody has challenges. Like in baseball. Exactly like that. Like, if the game doesn't go your way... O-or you forget your mitt one time. Are you still thinking about that? I really wanted my mitt. It's not easy to remember things all the time, Ollie. Grown-ups forget. They make mistakes and mess up. I want you to know I'll always be here for you. Always. I know, dad. Good. So... Mommy's gonna come by this afternoon, and she's gonna stay for a couple days. And then I'll be back. - Cool? - Cool. [ Footsteps approaching ] They're good people. Two boys at home, but they always wanted a daughter. Been trying to adopt for years. What do they know about our arrangement? Uh, an anonymous patron set up a trust. They're grateful for the help. I'd like to know how she's doing, you know, the occasional update. Maybe a photo. My department will make sure you get that.
