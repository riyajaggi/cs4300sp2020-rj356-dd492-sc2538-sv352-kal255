 I really think that one day they'll understand. They won't. Maybe they'll grow up believing that... Happiness is worth fighting for, worth changing for. I like that. Say it again. Really? No. Just tell me we're not ruining their lives. We'll be there for them. We'll love them more than anything. That's... that's what matters. And that's what'll get us through this. Oh, I should go. It's dark outside. Let me... Let me walk you to the car. Mm. I love you. I like that. Say it again. I talked to my guys at the morgue. The korskaya case is closed. What, that she drowned? In a tub? Overdose. It's not so surprising. These girls all get messed up in the end. So, you cops don't think someone might've killed her. Not that I've heard. Do you? She had a little girl... amy. Did they find the father yet? Mnh-mnh, no record of the guy. They're looking for a permanent home, But that'll take some time, you know. People aren't exactly looking to adopt some dead hooker's kid. Watch your mouth. So, uh, mcallister ain't working for you anymore? I mean, I hope you don't mind me asking. I just thought he was, you know, family. Actually, I do mind. Are we done? I didn't hear you come in. I packed oliver's lunch. Thanks. There's some coffee. I'll get some at the office. This is hard, I know. Hard? Wow. Hey, honey. Mm, you ever get to sleep? Mm-hmm. You want to play jenga while I make breakfast? No. Okay. You want some oatmeal? I got to run. I got an early meeting. Bye, buddy. Wait! What about mommy? Oh, daddy's in a hurry. Kiss mommy goodbye. Have a good day. No. A real kiss. Like in a wedding. ♪ Welcome back to work. It's good to see you here, son. I don't want to move into jack's office today. Yeah, sure, I understand. I don't think brandy wanted to die. She wanted to take care of amy. Sometimes it's hard to know what goes on inside someone's head. Maybe, but sometimes it isn't. T.J... I know it must've been awful finding her like that. But try not to dwell on it. Okay? Sara hanley? Nate greene? That's me. The reporter from new york? Precisely. Y-you want to come in? Yeah. Oh, man! My apartment is the size of your bed! Oh! Is it worth it, really, living in manhattan? You know what? Don't answer that. I'll just get depressed, and when I get depressed, I have to lie in bed blowing mithril On hobbit armies of the third age. You have a band-aid by any chance? New sneakers. Sure. So, I really like your article on that hypocrite c.E.O. Michael boyd? Yeah. What a douche! Your pictures were crazy good. You got an eye for sadism. That's a compliment. Thanks. Ah, buzz lightyear. How old's your kid? He'll be seven in a month. Does he live here with you? No, his, uh, dad and I... It's kind of complicated right now. Oh, yeah. My parents got divorced when I was nine. Sucked at first, but then it became strangely awesome. Two birthday parties. So, I know you didn't come all the way here for a band-aid. You know all those foreclosures from the crash? Homeless families in the south side Are using boarded-up houses for shelter. They're getting ousted by real-estate developers, Rousted by city officials, flousted by cops.

Aren't you gonna get your camera? I-I booked this job on... Home beekeeping. Hanley, you're wasting your talents! Take a risk! Get messy. Zarek: Thatcher. You wanted to see me? Brandy korskaya. Drowned in her bathtub. Under the influence. How does that happen? I guess it was a convenient tragedy. So you figured it out all by yourself To show some initiative. Is that it? Yeah. I knew what you wanted. You were wrong. I did what needed to be done. You don't decide that... ever! I watched you when I was a kid. What I am, I learned it from you. You killed a mother. You made her child an orphan. What do I tell my son? From now on, You do exactly what I tell you and nothing else, You understand? Now get out. Is there a code word? Drew: What?

I'm sorry about before... Our misunderstanding. I want to make it up to you. I know... I know we need the unions to raise their estimates On the streeterville project, right? So we can pad the budget Before your big meeting with the investors. What does that have to do with you? I can deal with the union, be a liaison.

Congratulations. Your kids are practically adults. Yeah. I could use a little advice, if you don't mind. I got to meet with a union rep About the streeterville budget. I reached out to dibinsky. He gave me the brush-off. Who else can I talk to? I don't know. I don't really care anymore. We've had our disagreements. But we're still family, right? We can't let the old man down. Just because you're, you know, in the situation you are, It don't mean you should abandon him. I'm sorry. You're on your own. I cleaned everything up for you, jack. For you and for t.J. What are you talking about? Don't pretend like you don't know how it is. Someone had to get rid of that girl. I didn't know you were coming. Well, it's their birthday. Of course I was gonna come. Yeah, but you can't just show up. You have to let me know. I called a few times. You don't live here anymore. It's my house, too. No, it isn't. It really isn't.

Vic is on his way here with t.J., And val is upstairs raiding my closet. I guess you're stuck with us. Hey, birthday girl. Oh, hi, dad. I didn't think you were coming. I wouldn't miss it. I was waiting for you downstairs. Guess I got distracted. Uh, I got this for you. Thanks. I'm going to the club with jules later. Which one? I remember you used to play this game with me When you were little, maybe 9 or 10 years old. Except the clothes actually fit now. Yeah, they do. Dad, are you okay? Yeah, I was just... Thinking back. I can't imagine you being with anyone but mom. You're never coming back, are you? Oh, yeah, all right! Have you been drinking? No. I have. I didn't let him drive. T.J., you know you shouldn't drink with your meds. I'm not on my meds. For how long? Who... who knows? Should we get him some coffee? Elaine: He might need more than coffee.

I was covering a story. Forget it. None of my business. Ollie had a bad dream, and he wanted to know where I was. Well, I considered telling him you had an affair. Drew, please. He senses something's wrong. He stole stuff from school. He what? School supplies. He won't look at me. He won't talk to me. He's anxious. He's not himself. I don't know what to do.

Okay, you two, let's, uh, go in the kitchen And have some cake. Hey, uh, I got this for you. Keep it. I don't need anything from you. Teenagers... it's never easy. I remember when t.J. Was his age. Why is t.J. Off his meds? How should I know? He's upset... About a lot of things. Your situation doesn't help any. That's not what this is about, thatcher. We both know what it is. You did it, didn't you? You had that girl killed. And why would I do that? You thought she'd turned on us. I didn't think it, jack. She did. So you admit it? I don't admit to anything. And you know what? You either work for me or you don't, And right now, you don't. So this is none of your business. You walked away from this family. I gave you everything, and what did you do? You pissed it all away! For what? Some other guy's wife? With a family of her own. Your pathetic midlife crisis. We're not talking about me now. No, we're not. We're talking about me Because I know that life is complicated. I apologize for nothing. You've had too many drinks, angelo. Stop, please! Stop, please! Angelo, stop! No, please! Get off her! Get out of here! Just leave us alone! Angelo, no, don't hurt him! Unh! Listen to me... Ohh! It's okay! Just go! Easy, kid! Don't! It's okay! Please just go! Take it easy! Just walk away. Never touch her again! Say it! Say it! I'm begging you... I'll never touch... That whore... Again. No... Unh! Aah! Unh! No! Whatever zarek did... That's on you. You set it into motion. We all make mistakes, jack. Only some of them are redeemable. Sara: Grown-ups sometimes need some time away from each other. So we came up with this plan That I'm gonna spend some nights at my studio, And then other nights, I'm gonna be here with you. And that way, we both get to spend a lot of time with you. Okay? And this has nothing to do with you. It's nothing you did. Okay? Mommy and I will... Will always be your parents, and we'll always be a family. We love you so much. We love you so much, honey. You're the most important thing in the world to us, ollie. Do you understand? Is there anything you want to say? I stole some things from my classroom.

I just want him to be happy. I just want him to be happy. Drew: Hey, bud. What are you drawing? Me, mommy, and you. Mm. That's awesome. I especially like my fluffy hair. In the picture you need a haircut. You know, when I was a kid, Some things happened that were hard for me. Sometimes I was a little scared. Did grandma ever have to sleep at her studio? Not exactly, but she had to raise us kids on her own. 'cause your dad went away. That's right. Where did he go? I don't know. He had some big problems. Just left. And grandma had to work... Really hard. And sometimes I wished things weren't the way they were, But you know what? What? Everybody has challenges. Like in baseball. Exactly like that. Like, if the game doesn't go your way... O-or you forget your mitt one time. Are you still thinking about that? I really wanted my mitt. It's not easy to remember things all the time, ollie. Grown-ups forget. They make mistakes and mess up. I want you to know I'll always be here for you. Always. I know, dad. Good. So... Mommy's gonna come by this afternoon, And she's gonna stay for a couple days. And then I'll be back. Cool? Cool. They're good people. Two boys at home, but they always wanted a daughter. Been trying to adopt for years. What do they know about our arrangement? Uh, an anonymous patron set up a trust. They're grateful for the help. I'd like to know how she's doing, You know, the occasional update. My department will make sure you get that.
