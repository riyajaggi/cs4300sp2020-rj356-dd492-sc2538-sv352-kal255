 Seven years as a state's attorney. No disciplinary actions, no complaints. High school, college, law school. No drugs, no booze, no debts, no girls. I got ya. Relax. It puts the lotion on the skin. "silence of the lambs." I am not killing it with the jokes here. Oh, I'm sorry. It's just, uh... Oliver's down the hall, and I should get dressed. He's fine. Zarek: But there's another thing... Something we might be able to use... On the wife. You know you can talk to me, right? Whatever it is. Yeah, of course. Why do you say that? Stafford's wife? Yeah. She's screwing some loser. Sara, I know you've been seeing someone. ♪ Hi. Hi. How are you? Okay. Good. How are you? Good. Better now. Hi. Hi. How do we do this? What do we do? We could just have a staring contest. I have so many questions. Ask me one of your questions. Will you come kiss me? No. No, you won't come kiss me? I want to look at you, sara. I just... I just want to look at you. Alissa: Sara, I know you're in there! Don't let me get mugged In this artsy, transitional neighborhood. Hey. Jack: Alissa, this is one of my new clients. Fred. Fred mccracken. I should have become a photographer. Hi. Alissa burns. Nice to meet you. A pleasure. Fred mccracken. So, I have 13 minutes To look at beautiful pictures of tacos Before my car gets towed or stolen... Probably stolen. You forgot you invited me here To look at beautiful pictures of tacos. I did not forget. But, uh, it was lovely to meet you. Oh, yeah, you too. Bye. Bye, fred. Oh, I've been meaning to tell you That the milwaukee shoot was canceled. The magazine can't pay for the hotel. Was that him? Your boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. You're right. That's true. Because we're not in high school. I know. I know. It's crazy. Did you call the therapist? I called and I made an appointment. I'm not sure I'm gonna go. You got a lot happening here, sara. I mean, therapists can be helpful in all sorts of ways. It's cheaper than a divorce lawyer. Monica: Drew stafford? I don't know him. Thatcher: Yeah, well, He seems to have a vendetta against my family. He wouldn't be the first one. About that other thing... I really could use your help. So could my son t.J. Thatcher... I'll tell you what. Let's go to the berghoff. We can talk about it over lunch. What do you say? Does the berghoff even still exist? It's been there 100 years. I'm not going to lunch, thatcher. I can't do it anymore. What, eat lunch? I can't help you. Not this time. I need this one, monica. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't vital. I know. But things aren't like they used to be. This town... it's changing. See you the next time. I may be busy for a while. I'll call you. Your one witness has disappeared. No physical evidence. No gun. And now t.J. Karsten has another bail hearing. You make it sound so negative. You undermined a two-year federal investigation By rushing into this in the first place. And now your crackerjack murder case Has blown up... Literally blown up. Can I say something, or is this just a lecture? T.J. Karsten is not gonna get out on bail. We are looking for connie mrozek, and we will find her. Now, can we get real About this vaunted federal investigation of yours? You blue suits were at this for, what, two years? And the one man you had to make your case Is dead... Because of the investigation. Now, I'm not thrilled about the recent developments, But I'm the only person that has anything on this family. So, please, get behind me Or get the hell out of my way. Monica: Mr. Mcallister, why do we need Another bail hearing in this case? We don't, your honor, if I may. It's ridiculous. Mr. Karsten was denied bail two days ago. Your only witness has suddenly gone missing, Mrs. Mrozek is not our only witness, she is not missing, And, in any event, we have her statement... A very strong statement. By "statement," you mean inadmissible hearsay That no court in this country would ever allow into evidence? Your honor, we are talking about a man charged with murder, Facing a potential life sentence With every motivation and resource to flee. Those were the facts two days ago. I'm going to set bail at $1 million. I assume you can post that. Of course. Thank you. What?! Your honor, respectfully, under section 110-4, no... I know the statute. You can see I'm a judge up here, right? The robe and all. That was easier than I thought. Her son wants to go to michigan law, So now he's going to michigan law. But he's on his own for the bar exam. You did that? Of course. How do you think it happened? We had a good argument, but I'm not taking any chances. 11:30? Sara: No. 12:00? No. 12:30? No. Seriously? This is harder than getting a table at alinea. Well, I have to work here until 3:00, And then I need to be at a shoot at 3:15, so... I'll, um, I'll call you if I have any cancelations. Brutal. Come with me. I need you. We need to restructure some data. Is that old-man code for "destroying files"? I'm not old. Compared to what? Can you do this? All of these... All the directories? As if they never existed. As if what never existed? Jack. There's something you should know about. I asked your daughter on a date. You asked val on a date? She likes girls. I thought you knew. I do know. Girls aren't the problem. You're the problem. You work here, and you're too old. I'm not old. Compared to val? A date. Stop that. I'm sorry to hear that, robert. Yeah, I'll get into it right away. Thank you. I'm having I.T. Do some file housekeeping. The federal investigation seems to be... That was the architect on the streeterville project. He's not getting paid. Evidently, the bank froze the funding. Why would they do that, jack? I don't know. You don't know. No bank has ever done this to me, not in 43 years. I'll call them. Don't bother. I'll take care of it myself. Are you okay, jack? You seem distracted lately. Distracted? Well, I wasn't too distracted to make sure T.J.'s bail hearing went our way. No. You pulled some trick with the judge, and we got what we needed. But t.J. Is still facing a murder charge. I've got the state's attorney breathing down my neck. And now a key piece of my business Is being shut down by the bank. Just sit on my ass while everything I care about goes in the toilet? Is that what you're saying I'm doing? What I'm saying, jack, is get your head in the game. The stakes are very high. All right, I'll think about that While I'm in michigan returning the judge's favor. Ahmed: The kx-600 listening device... Extremely powerful, easy to place, Nearly impossible to detect. Now, the rules... No water, no direct sunlight, And keep out of the reach of small children. It's a choking hazard. Also, it works best with a warrant. Yeah, I'm working on that. Need to move fast, though. I'm feeling the heat. Jack: Hey. Share a cab? How long we got? 15 minutes, But, see, now we're wasting time talking about it. Hey, let's keep it clean back there. Yes, sir. 14 minutes. Yes? Woman: Your 3:00 from the bank is here. Send him in. Bruce. You're not bruce. No. Bruce had another appointment. Come away with me for the night. For the night? You're supposed to be in milwaukee on a shoot. I've got business in michigan, But I can handle it from here. I know you have questions. You can ask me anything. I'll be here. Don't stand me up again. It's simple, mr. Karsten. We can't fund a project not properly zoned, And your streeterville development... The zoning is being handled by alderman arkovich. There's a vote. That vote's been taken off calendar. You're telling me the vote's been taken off the calendar? Apparently, yes. Have you any idea how many banks I could go to with this? No. How many? I appreciate you coming in to see me. I know you're in a bit of a predicament. What predicament? What do you want from me, mr. Stafford? I want to talk about one of my cases. Lou mrozek. Old man found shot and killed down at the water By a friend of yours... T.J. Karsten. I already gave my statement. And your statement was a lie. T.J. Was with me at pinter's that night. How much is thatcher karsten paying you to say that? This was a mistake. I don't have to talk to you. That's right, brandy from lithuania Working as a hooker on an expired student visa. You don't. You can talk to an immigration officer. But that conversation takes place With you in a colorful jumpsuit Under horrible fluorescent lighting And your daughter in foster care. That's the predicament. T.J. Didn't do this. I'm not interested in t.J., brandy. I want his father. It's been in the family forever. Well, my family, not the karstens. My dad was restoring it when he died. I took it back up a few years ago. It's really beautiful, jack. Yeah, it's a work in progress. I like a work in progress. Well, good, 'cause... You're the first visitor. What about your family? Well, they've never been here. It's just been... Mine. It's not a secret, exactly, but... Not shared... until now. Man: excuse me, mate. Could we trouble you for some glasses? Went on a grog run here. Forgot something to drink out of. Eh, sure. Glasses, yeah. I'll check down below. Beautiful boat. Bernie. Sorry to keep you waiting. I ordered you a macallan, neat. Water will be just fine. What's the matter, bernie? You dodging the I.R.S. Again? I've had one of those weeks. What is it that you want? Straight to business? Okay. I'm having a little trouble with my bank. They shut down the funding on the streeterville project. Some 12-year-old girl told me the bank was concerned The zoning vote might get pushed. Not might... did. The vote is off. Bernie, I did my part. What's going on? Thatcher, there's a lot of eyeballs Ever since your kid got nabbed. He was released this morning. It's not a problem. You don't get it. They're swarming you. State's attorney, the feds, National park service, probably. This kid drew stafford is up my ass. Yeah, I know about stafford. He not only wants to solve a murder. He wants to save chicago from itself. That's what he says. And by that, he means from people like you. "people like me" means "people like you." Why are you so spooked By some ivy-league pissant in suspenders? Stay the course, bernie. Show a little loyalty to the people who got you here. Things have changed, And if I don't change with them, I'm not gonna survive. So I'm sorry. I-I can't help you with this thing. Bernie. All these years we've known each other, done work together... I was at your daughter's wedding, remember? I built your damn swimming pool. You do not walk away from this table. I can't do it, thatcher. Jack: So, how long are you guys here for? The whole summer. Your summer. Our winter. I've been through your winter. That is not a winter. Oh. You lived in australia? I did. You did? I did. In college, junior year. How did I not know this? Well, I guess we still have a few secrets. How long have you two been together? Well, it feels like just yesterday. All right, so, where'd you live? Melbourne. I am so sorry. Sydney rivalry. It was one of the best times of my life. It's where I really got into photography. And beer. Yeah. And beer. Yeah, I didn't want to come back. So, why did you? Oh, well, that's another night And another two bottles. How often do you take the boat out, mate? Uh, not very often. Well, actually, never. Never? How did I not know this about you? Nick: Skyline is brilliant up here. Didn't you ever hear the poem, captain mcallister? A poem? Yeah. My mother had it on the wall Next to her bed when I was a girl. "a ship in harbor is safe. But that is not what ships are built for." Thanks for letting me come along, t.J. I'm really glad you called me. You're like family to me. Oh, here he is. Everyone, this is brandy. Woman: Hi. Brandy works at pinter's. Oh, what's pinter's? I-it's so nice to meet you all. I-I've heard so much about you. Why would you bring her here? It's my party and she wanted to come And I wanted her to be here. T.J., this is... T.J., it's so good to have you back home. Hey, man. Teej. I'm so glad you're okay. Well, of course I'm okay. Everything's okay. You know, he's gone all the time lately, dad. I'm sure he's no happier about it than you are. Tonight was for t.J. Elaine, he's in michigan Working to keep t.J. Out of jail. We're here tonight because of jack. So cut him a little slack. Okay, um, I have questions. Um... Did you really live in melbourne? Is that true? It's 100% true. All right, your turn. Okay. Serious one. Mm-hmm. Do you really know how to sail? I think so. Luckily, we'll probably never find out. Oh, that's sad, jack. You have to take this out. It's not right. Ask me another one... A real one. Anything. Do you ever get nervous? Rarely. Are you nervous right now? Yes. Do you like your job? No. Are you happily married? Uh, I don't know. Do you ever wish that we'd never met? No. Okay, your turn. Ask me anything. Yes. Another one, please. Do you like it when I do this? It's brandy, right? Oh! Val. Hi. So, how do you know t.J.? Are you two...? We're friends. Aha! Oh. Val, what are you doing in here? Just talking... Talking to brandy. Talk in the other room. Your grandfather's not gonna like it if you're in his office. It's from my phone, I think. Thanks. Jack? Jack? Well, apparently you know how to sail. Well, I haven't gotten us in yet. We have to go in? Not necessarily. Other option is to go down the tenn-tom waterway, Over to florida, up the atlantic seaboard, Down the st. Lawrence, across the lakes, and back here. That's the great loop. Or we could just head south of florida And sail around the caribbean... Like pirates. Wow. You've really thought about this. I've thought about it a lot. I've thought about taking this boat out a thousand times, Just this far, but... There was always some reason not to. The answer is yes. Tenn-tom waterway? No. The other question... the one that you asked me last night. There was a lot of questions. I do... Like it. Very much. Rodney? Rodney it is. What's up? I met your brother in jail... omar. He helped me. He was really nice to me. Doesn't sound like omar, But good to hear jail is having a salutary effect. Was there something else? You used a caprice rear quarter panel here, huh? That's not a caprice panel, boss. Well, they might have sold it to you as a bel air, But that's definitely a caprice. Nobody sold it to me as a bel air, and it's not a caprice. It's a 1971... I know. I know. 1971 impala. Small block 400. It's a nice car. Impala rear quarters are hard to come by, So I understand why you'd use a caprice. Did n use a caprice. I have a second series. 1962 impala ss409. It's all original, but... I need a new bright dip on the grille. Oh, there was something else. Uh, your brother... He wanted me to deliver a message to you. He said he couldn't tell you over the phone. 91-j. That's what he wanted me to tell you. You want to take this for a ride? You a trippy dude. I didn't get your name. T.J. T.J. Karsten. Hey. Have a good day, buddy. Thatcher karsten. Please don't tell me we have kids in the same class. I've heard a lot about you. I thought we should meet. Yeah. This seems like the appropriate place. You're a very tenacious young man, mr. Stafford. I was a tenacious young man myself once. A long time ago. That's what it takes in chicago, And it'll take you a long way. But you've got to pick your battles. The battles you can win. My business? My son? These are not smart battles. These battles you cannot win, mr. Stafford. These battles will destroy you. You know, when I was a kid... About the age my son is right now... I was scared of monsters, Especially monsters in the closet. I would ask my dad to leave the door open, Lights on, music playing, Anything to keep the monsters away. Then one day my dad, he just says to me... He says, "drew, these monsters... "if they're really so tough and scary, "why are they picking on little kids And hiding in the closet?" I was never scared of monsters again. Your father was a clever man. My point being... You aren't the thatcher karsten that I grew up hearing about. You're just a worn-out guy Waiting outside of an elementary school, Trying to intimidate an assistant state's attorney. Listen up, sonny. There are a lot of ways to get lost in chicago. Make sure you got a map. Jack, I need to ask you something important. Of course, um, anything. Uh, just give me two minutes. Uh, the harbormaster just signaled me. Two minutes. I'll be right back. Okay. Hey! Easy, killer. You could hurt yourself. What the hell are you doing? Karsten asked me to look into drew stafford, And that led me here. Small world, you banging his wife. I'm not... hey, I'm not judging, jack. But it is a very interesting development. What do you want, zarek? Same thing you want. Same thing everyone wants... Respect. I'm family, jack. Blood. But the old man, he only calls me for these one-offs. That's just not utilizing my full skill set. I want to be a full member of the team. T-that's between you and thatcher. It's more complicated now. Don't threaten me. Just think about it. I'll be around. Hi, jack. What are you doing in my house? Like, literally, right now? Did you sleep over? Well, if I'm being honest, there wasn't really a lot of sleep. Okay, that's not funny. I said a date. It's okay. This is not a date. Nothing happened here. Please don't be mad. All right. You need to leave. Give me that. I really like her, you know. Thatcher karsten outside your kid's school. My drop-offs are never that interesting. He's feeling the heat, he's gonna start making mistakes, And I'll be there when he does. You're really serious about this, aren't you? It's already done. A hooker informant planting a device at karsten allied. It's incredibly reckless. Big risk, big reward. Now just tell me the warrant you have covers it, please. Can you not, with the... I-I'm just saying. We just stayed up all night, and we talked. Val, no more sleepovers. No sneaking... No sneaking around. No lying. I didn't lie about anything. Jack: If she comes over again, It's during the day when one of us is home. Also, you need to show her where the glasses are. Did that work? Well, it might keep everyone's pants on downstairs. Beyond that, no. Ahh. You know... We snuck around. We did. And lied about it. Jack: What the hell is he doing here? Sometimes the velvet glove works, jack. And sometimes you need the iron fist. Stay in the car, t.J. Hey, hey. Heard you sailed right through the michigan trip, jack-o. Yeah, thanks, zarek. You got anything on stafford yet? Working on it. Thatcher: Ah! The honorable alderman bernard arkovich! What are we doing here, thatcher? I thought I made myself clear yesterday. I just thought it was important that we put yesterday behind us. Bulls-heat? On the floor with club access. We shouldn't let one little bump Spoil an otherwise productive relationship. So long as we understand each other. Oh, I think we do. Come on. Let me show you what I'm doing here. My dad always used to say falling for chicago Is like falling for a girl with a broken nose. You might find other girls who are lovelier But never one so real. I love this view. You can see the whole life of the city. My life. It started over there, now it's here And with all the things I built in between. Things we built, bernie. Together. You know that sandburg quote? "shoveling, wrecking, planning, Building, breaking, rebuilding." I'm not ready to give that up. I'm not gonna give that up. If this is about the vote, maybe I... We can see what we can do. Maybe we could do something, Maybe go at it another way. That's all I was saying, that times change, thatcher. That's all I was saying. That's good. Thatcher, don't! Some things change, bernie. But chicago... Chicago never changes. You son of a... How do we do business, jack? Not by failing, I can tell you that much. You may not like how I do it, But it works... always. Your way is too soft. It's... it's flabby. Make a few calls, send over some envelopes, Buy a few drinks. Hope everyone acts nice... Very nice... While they throw your son in prison And try to destroy everything you ever worked for. Thatcher, you crossed a line. Not for the first time, jack. And don't pretend you don't know it. Bernie arkovich is a thief, a liar, and a lush. He'd nail you to the wall for a new toilet seat If he wasn't too slow and too stupid to pull it off. Okay, so, you don't like what happened. Actually, I don't like it, either. It didn't "happen." you did it. But what I like even less Is some putz thinking he can play me With impunity! Now, about this prosecutor drew stafford... What do we got on him? ♪ Why is this dog hanging around here, man? 'cause it's my garage and I like him. The message from omar... 91-j. 91st and jackson. All kind of cash going through there right now. It's the place to hit, man. Got to do it now. I'm not getting involved in omar's business anymore. Rodney: This trunk looks like crap. You sure you didn't put a caprice lid on this one? Caprice didn't exist in 1962, rodney. They started in '65, I'm sure. Drew: Hola! I-I'll be right there! How was the trip? Whoa. Didn't realize you were going to the bahamas. W-we were shooting outside. Outside, huh? That's a weird place to get a sunburn. I got ya. Relax. Stafford's wife? Yeah. She's screwing some loser. Stafford's wife is having an affair? Pretty hot and heavy, from what I can tell. Who's the lucky guy? We don't know. We? Yeah, zarek and I, We've been talking, working on this together. Actually, in fact, I think that We need to involve him more in our business. You do? Oh, that's terrific, Because I've been thinking the same thing. Well, I'll see what I can get on the boyfriend. Probably just some poor jerk-off Who doesn't know what he's getting himself into. Sara, I know you've been seeing someone. I know about the therapist. The office called to confirm your appointment. Actually, I think it's great. You do? I do. You've seemed a little... Tense lately. Oliver: Home run, dad! Home run! Apparently, there's a home run. We need to talk about this some more. Oh, I got to tell you about a run-in I had With thatcher karsten outside of ollie's school. Total war with these guys. Find out who this guy is she's screwing. We can use him, disgrace the good counselor Right out of our way. I know you're uncomfortable With some of these tactics, jack. But you got to trust me. We're in a new situation here. We had a good day, but it's not over... Not by a long shot. They brought the battle to us, so... This is war. Synced & corrected by * Rambo Media Ltd *
