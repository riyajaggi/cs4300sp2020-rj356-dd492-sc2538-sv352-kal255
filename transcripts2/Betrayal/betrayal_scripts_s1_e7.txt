 It's all a whitewash by their lawyer... mcallister. Well, I'm sorry that... This mcallister is such a lowlife. All he does is mop up after karsten's mess. His hands are so dirty, it's only a matter of time Before he ends up behind bars, a real scumbag. Well I'm tired, drew. I'm heading to bed. I thought you wanted to hear about the case. I did. I do. I'm just exhausted. Hey, you ever find your phone? No, I didn't. You got a bunch of calls. Who's j.M.? I didn't say anything before, But he's interested in buying a print. Don't do that. Don't lie to me. You've been having sex with him, right? Right? Get out. Come on... out. Please... Get out! Don't talk to me like that. Oliver: Mommy? Don't let him see this, okay? Mommy? Mommy and daddy are just talking, okay? You're gonna go back to sleep, okay? Go back to sleep. Okay. All right. Please. It's not fair. If I'm not here in the morning, He's not gonna understand... You are not sleeping here tonight. It's not fair to him. Please. Drew, we can just talk about it, okay? No, we can't. Please. Not now! ♪ I'm so sorry. What now? I don't know. What are we doing? It'll be okay. Yes. I'll stay with you tonight. You shouldn't be alone. No, I-I need to think. Let's just... Let's talk tomorrow. Okay. Come on. Hey. Oh, hey. I've been meaning to scrape that down. You've been very busy keeping my little brother out of jail. Why didn't you come to the restaurant? Everyone was so happy. Oh, I was trying to finish some stuff at the office. Because I brought champagne for the two of us. What's the matter? You're like 8,000 miles away. I have something to tell you. What, babe? I-I quit karsten allied. What? When? On my way out of the courthouse today. My dad didn't say anything to me. It was a long time coming. I need a new start. Jack. Oh, jack! Oh, you know how long I've been waiting for this. You know, we can have a normal life now. We're not tied to my father. You know what? We have to go somewhere. We should go to... To door county, right? Get one of the cabins up there, just you and me. Baileys harbor. Remember? We love that place... The sunsets and the great wine And the long naps in the hammock. I'm so excited. Mm. Mwah! Cheers. To freedom. Daddy, I had a bad dream. It's okay, buddy. Come here. Where's mommy? Don't worry. She'll be back soon. I let myself in. I just... I didn't want to wake him. How are you, sweetheart? Oliver: Today's show-and-tell... Aunt chloe's toy! Oh, no. I left it in my room. Okay. Can we find some time to talk? There's nothing to talk about. Well, amy's gonna finish the school year, And then we plan to move to ann arbor. My friend has a waitressing job for me there... A great place. Don't do that. Stay. I-I've been thinking... Maybe if... Then I could bring some clothes over to your place, And I could leave them there, like, all the time, you know? We could... We could live together. You're a good guy. You've been real nice to me and amy... A real friend. Don't you like me? I do. T.J., I-I do, but... What? Well, there are many reasons. The biggest one is your father. Well, what do you mean? Listen, t.J., I know this... Your father will do whatever it takes To make sure it never happens between us. We can't get around that. Are... are you... do you... Do you want to take him to school today? You ready, bud? Wave to mommy. Bye. Bye. Ah, you are a little early, don't you think? You're not supposed to be here until 3:00. Well, I was in the neighborhood, "you know, I should show elaine this new malbec." You think you can just come in here whenever you like, huh? It's fun to come up with excuses to be in the neighborhood So that I can just drop by and say, "hey, I was in the neighborhood." What do you mean, "excuses"? To see you. Look, elaine, am I crazy? Am I imagining this thing between us? There's no thing. You're married. I know. Now, that doesn't mean I can't be attracted To other people, but... You're attracted to me? What I'm trying to say is that I... Are you attracted to me? We can't have this conversation. Because I-I am attracted to you. Stop. Stop what? I think I think maybe you should start Doing your deliveries in the evening, And I'm gonna have my night manager, marco, Do the buying. Wait, seriously? You mean that? Okay. I totally hear you. You have a customer. We're closed. Sorry. Mrs. Mcallister, hi. I, uh... I'd like to talk to you. It's personal. There's something I wanted to let you know. Your... Your husband... he, um... Well, he and I... Um... We fought a hard battle. And now that the case has been dismissed, I just... I wanted to apologize for any annoyance I might have caused you or your family. My brother was in jail for three days because of you. Well, we may have been too aggressive. I may have been too aggressive. And for that, I'm sorry... Truly. Thank you for hearing me out. You know, there is one more thing. Hey, um, I've left you a few messages. Well, I'm on my way down, so I'll see you soon. Mr. Mcallister, I was brought in to manage this office To clean up the mess made by drew stafford And larry abrams on the, uh, mrozek murder investigation. We acknowledge that case spun out of control. Jack: Well, we can agree on that, But I don't understand why you wanted me to come in. We respect the contributions made By the karstens to the community, to the mayor, To both of their election campaigns. I just wanted to make sure we're good. I no longer work for thatcher karsten. Really? I had no idea. Well, I'm sorry to have wasted your time. Yeah. Don't be too hard on stafford. He was just doing his job. I saw elaine today. The ossobucco at her place... Best I ever had. Howard? May I ask why jack mcallister was just... No, you may not. Here's how it goes from now on... I talk, and you nod appreciatively. You're on probation, stafford. I'm well aware I was a little ambitious and... Good. Then be aware of these. New cases, all yours, the only cases you'll work. Sir, I'm a first-chair prosecutor. You're giving me d.U.I.S? I am. And let me be crystal clear... Your eyeballs wander one millimeter From those sons of bitches, And you can kiss your career in government goodbye. The lou mrozek case is over. Hey. Jack: Hey. I was at the prosecutor's office, Wrapping up some stuff with t.J.'s case. I ran into drew stafford. He said he came by the restaurant. Yes, he did. What did he want? He wanted to apologize for putting our family through hell. Yeah, he said he read a review of my ossobucco And he wanted to make a reservation, That his wife's birthday was coming up. Wh-wh-what are you doing? But I did get a little carried away in cleaning everything out. It's my new mission... Simplify everything. What trip? Last night. Door county? I got us that same place in baileys harbor... The cabin by the lake. So, we are going to have four days of nothing... No kids, no case, no karsten allied. It's just you and me. Elaine, please. We're not going to baileys harbor. Sara? 4:00 in the morning? Yeah. The sister I grew up with never got up before noon. Well, this job at the bakery relaxes me. And also getting up so early keeps me out of trouble. I mean, can't really show up to work hung over At 4:00 in the morning. How long has it been? 10 months. And you feel good? I feel really good most of the time. I just call my sponsor, go to a meeting. Sometimes, I call mom and dad. All they do is talk about you all the time... Well, mostly about their one and only grandson. You all right, sara? Yeah. Why? I'm fine. Don't take this the wrong way, But what the hell are you doing here? What do you mean? I came to see you. Come on. We've barely spoken in years. You drive all the way down here just to say hi. What's going on? It wasn't something I was looking for... Or ever imagined. And everything you believed about us, I believed, too. I was happy. And then this... Well, it happened. I'm sitting here, And I'm waiting for you to tell me that you love me, That you love our kids, And that you don't want to break up our family And that... You want to be forgiven For your selfishness and your stupidity. Oh, wait. You won't say that because you love her. You're in love with her. You... you think you're in love with her. No. Sara: I should have responded to your e-mails, Come down and helped you during rehab. I made your life miserable for years. You miss a lot of birthdays, You've got a lot of making up to do. Yeah, but I was too hard on you. I was too judgmental. It wasn't fair. The truth is that I... I didn't understand how you could mess your life up Over and over. But now I do because I'm in a bit of a mess myself. I'm... I'm having an affair. He's married. And drew found out. I love him. Tell me that I'm not crazy. Tell me I'm not losing my mind. I don't think I can do that, sara. I think you're being a fool. Do you really think that this is gonna last? I mean, after... after 20 years of marriage, do you... That's hers, isn't it? I have been walking by this thing In my own house, And you let me! You son of a bitch! You lying coward! You... you've destroyed this family. Are you guys okay? You did this. You tell them. Uh, your mom and I... We're dealing with some stuff. We want you both to know, though, no matter what happens, We... we love you very... What stuff? I've met someone. What does that mean? It means he's cheating on mom. Zarek: Ducking the feds, fixing that alderman situation. I hope everything I've been doing is helpful, thatcher. No, I appreciate it. Well, I want you to know you can rely on me for anything. The stuff jack did, the stuff jack never would... Whatever you need... I can handle it. You a lawyer? Did you even make it past the 10th grade? It's not that easy to step into jack's shoes. Maybe not, but I have other skills that are useful. Take a look. Sara: I really never thought I thought because you've been there yourself, that maybe... Chloe: That maybe what? I'd just encourage you to blow your life up? No, but understand. I just can't be a cheerleader for you while you self-destruct. What if I'm getting happier? Isn't that what happened to you? You bounced back better. You're kidding, right? I'm estranged from everyone who ever loved me. And all those people you hurt... They never forgive you. They might say they do. No, they never get over it. Jack asked me not to show you. I was trying to be a team player. I tried real... I need to talk to you, dad. This isn't a good time, t.J. I'm tired of you controlling my life. From now on, I work where I want to work, And if I want brandy to be my girl, Then you stay out of it. Brandy is no good for you. I get to say. You don't get to say. I don't want to talk about this now. I'm gonna marry her. You're what? I need to get mom's ring. When she died, she gave it to me to give to my wife. Don't be stupid. Don't call me that. The woman's a whore. I paid her to be nice to you, to spend time with you. That's not true. She likes me. She's an fbi informant. They want to put me in prison. You don't want me to be happy. You never have. You'll say anything. Damn it, t.J.! You stay away from her. The best thing would be for that girl to disappear From both our lives forever. I used to think I was so lucky being your son. I never think that anymore. You the owner? Are you a cop? Cook county prosecutor. Darius miller. He worked here, right? So, you know he was shot? I saw it on the tv. Sweet impala. Fancy clientele, huh? Not really, but we do all right. You know if lil' d was connected With the karsten family at all? Thatcher karsten... Real-estate business. I don't know anyone named thatcher, And I don't imagine lil' d did, either. Would you consider him a friend? He was a good kid. I liked him. Capable of murder? He didn't kill that old white man by the river If that's what you mean. I don't think he did, either, but I can't prove it. Now everyone I work with thinks I've lost it. Sounds rough for you. Cheers. Hey, remember when I came to chicago to visit you To make amends? Which time? We went for that walk in lincoln park. I kept trying to apologize, But you'd just say it was fine and change the subject. You never really wanted to talk to me About all those bad times. Yeah, well, it just seemed easier to leave it alone. Hey, you know, you are allowed to be angry at me. Yeah, I know. Yeah, but what's the point in saying all those things? Where does it get us? Well, closer, maybe. Well, thanks for the coffee and the bread. Right. See you around. What do you want from me, chlo? It's just the truth. You've been angry about it for years. You really want to hear it, How you consumed mom and dad's attention, All of it, how there's not a drop left for me, How in high school, I lay in bed Wondering how many car wrecks you were away From getting yourself killed? Asking me to hide your coke in my makeup bag Because mom checked yours? Or your druggie boyfriend, jimmy, hitting on me After you pass out in the basement Because you were so high? Or that time... Or the time I found you In the bathroom with a razor and all the blood? Is that what you want? Is that really gonna make us closer? I'm sorry I put you through All those things. I am. I know. Maybe now we're both screw-ups, We can actually spend christmas together. I'd like that. Hi, dad. Don't scream. Sit. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm here to make you a deal on behalf of mr. Karsten. Where's your daughter? At the neighbor's. This is how this is all gonna go down. Mr. Karsten will wire you $250,000. It is a one-time fee. You will take it, And you will move with your daughter To another city within one week. Do you understand me? Yes or no? How do I just... No, that's not a yes or a no. Do you understand? Can you stay away from mr. Karsten's son? Yes or no? Yes. Then we should have a toast. Do you have any booze? Um... Gin under the sink. That'll do. Korskaya. That's, uh, lithuanian, right? Yeah. My people are polish. Grandparents are from, uh, elblag. That's near lithuania. You know, maybe our ancestors actually knew each other. Na zdrowie. Elaine: I just never thought That he could do anything like this to me. Did you? No. He was acting strange lately, but I thought it was... I don't know. I assumed it was you. I mean work, you know, the case. Was I the only one who didn't know about this? Did you know? I had no idea. My grandmother used to make this lithuanian soup. It was amazing. It was, uh, boiled potatoes, Sour cream, buttermilk, and dill. Did you ever have it? I feel... the room is spinning. Here. Lie down, hon. Yeah, just lie down right here. Yeah. There you are. I love you, lainie. You're gonna get through this thing. I know you feel really vulnerable And alone right now, but you're not. I'm gonna take care of you... Protect you. You're my daughter. We're a family of fighters... And survivors. We always come out on top. Can we talk? I'm sorry, and I know how that sounds. Yeah. Pretty weak. Drew... Please talk to me. Tell me what you want to do now. What can I say? When did you first have sex with him? When? A few days after the gallery event. Where did you first have sex? It's not about... where? My studio, if you have to... How about here? Did you... stop. Did you? No. Okay? Why not? Because I wouldn't. Out of guilt? Drew. How about him? Did he want to do it here? He's not like that. Oh, he's too honorable, right? Why don't we talk about real things between us, You and me? Like what? How you've taken me for granted for years. Oh, so now it's about what I haven't done for you? No, but, drew, this didn't just happen in a vacuum. I met someone at the exact moment That I was falling into unhappiness with our life. What the hell is wrong with our life? It's all about you. Our marriage has always just been about you, Your plans, your ambitions. Oh, so I should feel ashamed about my aspirations? No, but you've turned me into some sort of accessory, And I let it happen. I should have realized this a long time ago. That's my fault. We haven't been happy, drew. We've been pretending. And I know that now. And I think you know it, too. We were happy once, weren't we? I thought... I thought so. I thought that's what happy was. I'm sorry that it all happened like this. Brandy? Are you home? Brandy? What are you doing here? I thought that you had the night off. I was in the neighborhood. Are you okay? Well, I've been better. Does your wife know? You know, I've just... I've made so many wrong choices in my life That I thought were right. Now I don't trust myself. I don't know what I'm doing. Let's go inside. Maybe I should just get a hotel room, raid the mini bar. Stay. Please. Let's not be alone tonight.
