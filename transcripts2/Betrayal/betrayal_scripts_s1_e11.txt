 How did that gun get in your car? The person who killed lou. You know who that was? Previously on "betrayal"... It's delicious. You don't like it. You don't have to lie just to be nice. Isn't it crazy how women always do that? I know who killed uncle lou, and I think you do, too, dad. Do you remember that night when you called me Asking for help to find the magic book? Lou mrozek was killed that night. Jack was standing next to me when I talked to you.

 Jack: I'm here to make a confession. I killed lou mrozek. Mitchell: I hear you have something to say About the mrozek murder. It was me. I killed lou mrozek. Is that so? Start at the beginning. Lou was embezzling from karsten allied. It had been going on for a while. It was over $1 million before we figured it out. I confronted him one night. Things got heated. I didn't know he carried a gun.

 For protection? Well, he was paranoid, jumpy. I should have anticipated it, but the gun surprised me. He pointed it at my chest. Without even thinking, I lunged, Wrestled it from his hands, and shot him. It wasn't... Rational. It was like a reflex. What about t.J. Karsten? Was he with you? I didn't tell t.J., but I followed him from the restaurant. Why? Well, 'cause t.J. Was emotional. Lou was under siege. I wanted to make sure things didn't escalate. But they did? But not until after t.J. Left. That's when I approached lou myself. And that's when you shot him? Yes. Like I told you, it was in self-defense. So... To the best of your recollection, These are the events that took place On the night of September 27, 2013? Yes. I swear, I just wanted to talk to him. Uh-huh. And things got out of hand. Yeah. I guess you could say things got out of hand. ♪ Sorry to bother you again. He doesn't want to see you. Well, tell him that I'm still here And that I'm not leaving until he lets me in. Yeah, you've been here all morning. I think you should probably go home. Hi. I'm here to see, uh, jack mcallister. Popular guy. Can I see your I.D.? Yes. I'm elaine mcallister. I'm his wife. Okay. Wait here. Thank you. Elaine, I... don't. There's nothing to say. Actually, I'm wondering. Why did you come to my restaurant? What did you want? I'm sorry. I don't want your apology. I just want to know. What the hell did you want? I guess I wanted to know more about jack. About his marriage? You can go in. How did that work out for you? This is about t.J., isn't it? No. T.J. Shot him and you were there. You're covering for him. No, I swear. Jack, you didn't do this. I know you. After all that's happened, can you really say that? No. I guess not. Lou pulled a gun. I had no choice. So, you're saying that you shot lou And you let t.J. Take the fall for it? I knew the charges wouldn't hold. Well, my brother went to jail for you. T.J. Understands. What does that mean? Was he in on it? No. So, why are you confessing this now? They're taking another look at the case. I didn't want to risk it. T.J.'s been through enough. Look... I know this is a lot. But I hope someday you'll understand. I doubt it. I need to go. You know the kids are very upset. You tell them I love them, okay? Okay. Bye, jack. Newscaster: Karsten allied's former top attorney jack mcallister Is in police custody for... Turn it off. The shooting death of lou mrozek, thatcher karsten's Close business associate and brother-in-law. How could he have done this? There has been no official statement So we are still waiting to hear all the details. God. All this time, I've just kept telling myself That he was different, that he's one of the good guys. Why are you defending him all of a sudden? Dad's just another karsten thug. Shut up. I mean, you just don't get it. Elaine: Hey. Hey. Is he all right? Yeah. He says he loves you both. And are you all right? I have no idea. I will be, I think. Could we go visit him? No. I want to see him. Maybe in a few days. He was protecting himself. It's justified. He killed our uncle. He's been lying to all of us. How can you be on his side? Enough! Enough! Enough. Listen, if there's one thing... The only thing... That I'm certain of It's that we have got to stick together If we're gonna get through this. Yeah, well, then maybe we won't. These really necessary? Turns out you're a violent offender. What are you doing here? Back on the case. Reward for not giving up. Now... I want to know what really happened. I already gave my statement. Guy with a story like that could walk out of here With no jail time, but somehow, something doesn't seem right. Oh, it never does with you. But it's the truth. You sure about that? 'cause I have evidence against you... Evidence that could put you away for a long time. What are you talking about? What evidence? I have evidence of motive and premeditation... Evidence that makes your self-defense plea Look like a joke. Yeah, you're lying. No. But I think you are. You know, from now on, you speak to my lawyer. Sara's still waiting outside, you know. She's been sitting there for hours. Okay. He'll see you now. What's going on? Sara... why wouldn't you see me? I didn't know what to say. This makes no sense. I was with you that night, September 27th, dune acres. No. No, you've got the dates mixed up. Jack, you didn't shoot anyone. I understand why you're trying to cover for me, But there's no need for that now. What are you doing? I'm coming clean. It's not possible. Look, I've hired a lawyer, and it's gonna be okay. No, it's not. Nothing about this is okay. Sara. You promised. You promised you wouldn't shut me out. I shot him, all right? In self-defense. I don't understand. Listen to me, there's a reason for everything. I told you I don't want it. For your mortgage. The kids' tuition. Jack could go away for a very long time, I haven't needed your help before. I don't need it now. I'm such an idiot. Nothing ever changes. Everything that's going on, The mess that our family is in right now, It is terrifying and destructive, And it all comes back to you. I don't want it. That's incredible. No matter what happens, You always find a way to make it my fault. Look, lainie, jack is not the man we thought he was. That should be fairly obvious by now. He betrayed all of us... T.J., me, you... We're not talking about that. That's not it. Then what are we talking about? It's not as simple as you think. The very fact that they arrested him means that they... Jack wasn't arrested. He went in and confessed. Did he? He told the police everything. Jack shot him because he was defending himself. So, he's going to plead self-defense? Yes. And with any luck, maybe he won't do any time. So at the very least, Maybe your grandchildren won't lose their father. I really got to go to work. See yourself out. Drew. Ollie got picked up early for carpool. Yes, I remembered his homework. Yeah, actually, I was hoping to catch you. Well, I got to leave in a minute, but shoot. Jack's innocent. I think you know that. He confessed, sara. He did most of the work for us. He placed himself at the scene of the crime. Yeah, but he couldn't have done it. Because he was in dune acres with me. I'm telling you the truth. Or maybe you're just saying What you need to say to cover for him. It wouldn't be the first time. I'm not. I promise. Look, even if I believed you, nobody else would. Jack won't even go along with your story. Your trying to save a man that doesn't want to be saved. Why? I don't know. I don't really care. Look, I am sorry to put you in this position. I am trying to solve a crime, sara. Without hard evidence, your word is... Well, the legal term is "unreliable." I have to take this. I'll talk to you later. Hello? New information has been brought to light. Our investigation is evolving. Thatcher: Don't give me that. Why didn't you charge him with murder? I'm sorry... I can't discuss Any details of the case at this time. You didn't even have a case till I gave you one. He's making up this self-defense crap To avoid being indicted for murder. Any idiot could see that. We are pursuing every possible theory And every lead into this crime. Jack mcallister's the best liar you ever met. He's still playing you, And you're letting him get away with it. I need to go. Goodbye. Jack: If you want to join me, you're welcome. I mean, no pressure, though. I can go alone. Hello. Nice to see you again. Hey. Hi. Got a lot of business from your story. Oh, good. That's great. Jack: How did your shoot go? Well, turns out dead fish Make very cooperative subjects. How did you choose it... Photography? Uh, my father bought me One of those instant polaroids when I was little. What about you? How did you choose law? Um, kind of fell into it, actually. But I guess I had a knack for it. You know, planning several steps ahead And planning out every conceivable worst-case scenario, Protecting against it. How do you protect against every worst-case scenario? Well, you start by looking at why what happened. If you know where to look, there's a reason for everything. Naomi: Are you okay? Sorry? You should come inside. Weather... it's gotten cold. Yeah. Not like when you were here before. What was that? Three months ago? Seems like a lifetime. Violet. Drew. Jack hiring you can only mean one thing. It's worse than he says. Actually, jack hired me mostly out of concern Over how rabid and unprincipled he thinks you've become. I can't tell you how little I care what he thinks. The thing is, I always heard you were one of the good guys Who'd rather see justice done than waste everyone's time Over overblown charges that are never gonna hold. Remind me, he confessed, right? To self-defense, not murder. Got a corporate file that points to jack Having embezzled $1 million and a corroborating interview With the accountant, matthew hendricks. Provided to you by? You know I can't tell you that. It's got karsten's fingerprints all over it. No comment. You've got testimony from a lowlife accountant And shady bookkeeping given to you By a crook with a personal vendetta. It's hearsay, it's circumstantial, And we both know it's not enough for murder one. Well, I guess we'll just see what the judge has to say. You know, you're not how I pictured you. You're kind of cute, actually. You have a reputation for being so principled. So it makes me sad to see you go from being An anti-karsten crusader to this. Call me if your conscience returns. Hi. My name's sara hanley. I was hoping you kept a record of my stay in September. Oh, from September, no. But I check every guest in myself, And I never forget a face. Now, you, you have a very nice face, But I don't remember it. Well, I didn't come up to the desk. Oh. But... He did. Hmm. I can't be sure. I... Might remember him a little bit. I.D. And credit card? You know, I forgot my wallet, but I have cash. Well, we got to have I.D. And a credit card. Hey, um, is that a guest book? Yeah, I make everyone sign in. Keep the extra. You still got to sign in. Do you mind if I take a look? Sure. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. So, what do we got? Not a lot. I can't get the file From multinational builders corp excluded... We've been over this. Karsten doctored it. What if I can't prove that? I have faith in you. Jack, the case for murder one Is largely circumstantial, but it's strong. Plus karsten still wields a lot of influence in this town. You really want to roll the dice against him? I'm not sure I have much choice. You know I'm never gonna ask you whether or not you're guilty. But I have a pretty good idea that you didn't shoot anyone, And I can't begin to speculate why karsten is piling up on you And why you're even willing to take this hit. But I'm not gonna let you hang yourself. So here's what we're gonna do. Retract the confession. On what grounds? It was given under duress. There was no duress, violet. I'll make the case. We can refute the evidence Of your embezzlement of karsten's funds, Your association with the crooked accountant... Good. While simultaneously re-investigating... The mrozek murder, coming up with a killer. A viable theory with a convictable perp. That won't work. Look, I know you've tried this already, But I have a lot more experience with criminal litigation. I have my ways. Stop. You've dug yourself a real hole here, But I'm gonna get you out. The best way to do that I'm the client here, okay? You have to do what I want. Stay the course. It was self-defense. Now go after thatcher, go after phony evidence. Don't let me get stuck with murder one. But don't re-investigate the murder? The real killer doesn't matter. Is this all about karsten? What happened between you two? We had a falling out. You're a strange guy, jack. Not really. It's just hard sometimes for people to see how normal I am. Are you hungry? A-are you? Yeah, it's just kind of crowded. May have to wait a while. I mean, we can go if you want. Do you want to? Your choice. Yeah, sure. I mean, we can grab something at the station. Sure. Let's do that. Okay. Excuse me. Your table's ready. We'll catch the later train? Yeah. Can I help you? Yeah. Um... Do you remember me and this man having dinner here? I don't think so. When was this? About three months ago. Seriously? Yeah. Okay, well, thank you. Sorry. Hey. Um... How long do you guys keep security footage? Let me check. Okay. Drew: This is drew stafford. Leave a message. I've got something to show you. Heading to your office. I'll be there soon. If you know where to look, there's a reason for everything. You dropped your scarf. It gets cold. I started to feel like I could imagine my life Not the way it is, but... The way you dream it. This... This is for you. Happiness is worth fighting for and worth changing for. All we can have hope for is that we are Where we're meant to be, which I'm certain of right now. Whatever comes, whatever challenges, We'll face them together. I promise. There's a reason for everything. Have you shown this to anyone? Not yet. How did you get it? I went back to dune acres. Made me remember things... About how you think, how you always plan ahead. I know you want me to follow you Without having to tell me why. I didn't think I could. But I can. If that's what you want. I won't use it. What made you decide that? Because I trust you. Officer: Time's up. I got you a birthday present. It's at your place in one of the boxes I left there. It's wrapped in striped paper with a blue bow. I want you to open it. Okay. You'll understand. Hey, vic. Are you okay? I understand that you're upset, But, you know, we... We can talk about this. Dad didn't kill uncle lou. I know it's hard to believe. No. Mom. What I'm saying is everything that's happened, It's because of me. Whatever your dad did, it was his choice, okay? If he has made mistakes, if he did something bad, It is not your fault. Listen to me! I'm telling you it is. I was there that night... When lou died. I dropped t.J. Off, and I parked the car. When I went to find them, they were arguing. It's none of your business, t.J.! No, just explain to me! Hey! Get out of my way! No! Why won't you explain to me what happened?! Get out of my way! Let me go! Hey! And then lou pulled out a gun. Back! I didn't know what to do. Put it down, lou. Back up. T.J. No. Put it down. Back! Put it down! T.J. Knocked the gun out of his hand. No! I picked it up. It all happened so fast. Give me the gun! Give me the damn gun! No! Give me that gun! Vic! Vic! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know why I did it. I'm sorry. Shh. Come in. Where is he? He's upstairs. I couldn't keep lying anymore. I think it's time to tell the truth. I think you're right. No, he's not. We can't tell anyone about this. We have to keep this between us. Jack has a plan. He always does. Jack is lost. He's confused. I think that's what these past few months Have been all about. Yeah, he's in trouble, t.J. I mean, we can't just leave him there. No! Jack is smart. He knows what he's doing. We can't give in. We have to stay together. That's the karsten way. You sure are a creature of habit. The macallan's still where it used to be. Hello, violet. It's been a while. I've been busy. You've been discreet... Until recently. I haven't had any need of your services, So... Discreet enough. Yeah, well, you had jack defend t.J. On that murder charge. How did that go? T.J.'s free. And now we know what really happened. You think? You ask me, you could have used my help on that, thatcher. Maybe then you wouldn't have to deal with me now. Am I dealing with you? You know jack's brought me on to represent him. Of course he has. Why shouldn't he have the best? You remember in '08 When I defended the two of you in that bribery case? Back in the heady days of blagojevich? Who got exactly what he deserved. The state went after jack. They offered you immunity to roll on him. It was a good deal. But you wouldn't take it. You were insulted to even be asked. Did you really think I'd turn on my own son? So, what's changed? Well, for one thing, he killed my brother-in-law. Come on, now. We both know that's not true. But for some reason, jack has put himself in the line of fire, And now you want to bury him. Violet, I'm just a law-abiding businessman Cooperating in a felony murder investigation. How could you possibly think There was anything emotional about that? You're gonna testify against jack? If I have to. And you're prepared to be cross-examined by me? Because you know, thatcher, the past is the past, And I'll go hard at you regardless of our relationship. Is that supposed to be a threat? No. It's just a suggestion That you take your foot off jack's neck Before someone kicks you in the balls. Ah. Yeah, I guess that is a threat. Hey. Oliver's asleep. Well, goodnight. Oh. What were you calling about earlier? Um, I was wondering what was going on with the case. Well, his lawyer's pushing for self-defense, But we're going for murder one. What? Why? You know I can't discuss that. And if he's convicted? 20 to 60 years, probably, but there's some extra charges, So he'll be a pretty old guy by the time he gets out. But he didn't shoot him, drew. Let's not start that again. He didn't. I have proof. It's dune acres, time stamped 8:08 p.M. Drew, I know you don't want to Put an innocent man behind bars. So, his confession was a lie? Yes. Why would he do that? I don't know what or who to believe anymore. And frankly, I am tired of feeling that way. Okay. He was with you. But you know what? He has done a lot of bad things in his life, And if this isn't one of them, Well, at least he's where he belongs. Drew! I have a confession from a guy And a pattern of facts to support it! If he concocted it, then he's probably hiding something worse. That's just not true. You don't know that! I do! I know him! You know him?! All right, then. Explain it to me. Tell me! Tell me, why would he lie?! Because it was his son. So, jack's covering for his son. That's what this is all about? But he'll never admit to that. And I swore not to say anything, but... but what? You're trying to save jack By appealing to my sense of justice. Do you really want to send a man away For protecting his child? A child who shot a man. Am I supposed to just let that go? Is your moral compass that compromised That you really think that's the right thing to do? Look, before any of this happened, You wanted one thing... To get karsten. What if jack agreed to turn against him? Are you trying to make some kind of deal? Would you consider it? In exchange for karsten? Wouldn't that matter more? No. Not enough. Why not? Because a man was murdered, and even if jack didn't do it, He lied repeatedly, and that is against the law. He is trying to pervert the justice system. This is a man that worked his entire life For a criminal enterprise. He's changed. Really? So, he's... Some sort of hero martyring himself? What you signed up for with this man... You are in way over your head. He is a bad guy. Why would I just let him go? I don't want him around you. I don't want him around oliver. It is not safe. Okay. Ah, you've joined forces. That should increase efficiency. Sit down and shut up. See, I wouldn't have started like that. I would have said, "we have a proposal." You want me to give up karsten. Every single thing necessary to put karsten away. He walks out a free man... No plea, no charges, no jail time. We'll let him out on his own recognizance for now. We're not dropping the case. The charges are still pending. There's no guarantee until we see how it goes. Without a deal, he says nothing. Without a deal, he goes down for life. Give us a minute to work it out, just me and jack. Jack, I wouldn't advise... No, it's fine. Is this the part where you tune me up? Don't I wish. We'll save that for another time when I'm not on the clock. Here's how this is gonna go. You and I are gonna comb through karsten's history. And if it proceeds as it should, You killed mrozek out of self-defense, You do minimum time, maybe even time served. But if you leave out one thing, anything, If karsten forgot to change a blown bulb on a scaffolding And you don't tell me about it... Then you're coming after me. No. I'll go after your son. Glad you're out. You told drew. I asked you not to. I know, but... You talk about trust and then you do that? I was scared for you. Risk exposing a secret that I let you in on... Something I'm doing to protect my son. You're right. I'm sorry. But in my place, I think you might have done the same thing. You should go home. Your family needs you and vic needs you. Yeah. Look, I have to figure out what to do for him To... Make him better. I guess we'll talk tomorrow. I don't think so, jack. What are you talking about? Everything that's happened is our fault. We've been so selfish. What's happening now is because of the life I've led... The life that I'm trying to break out of, That I am breaking out of with you. I can't imagine living with the karstens As part of my life or as part of ollie's life. They won't be. They will. You'll always be tied to them. You'll always be one of them. I love you, but I just can't be with you. ♪ Synced & corrected by * Rambo Media Ltd *
