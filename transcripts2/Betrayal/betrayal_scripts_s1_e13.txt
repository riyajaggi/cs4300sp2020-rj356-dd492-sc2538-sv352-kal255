 Hey, let me go! Let me go! Hey! ♪ Woman: Sir? How is she? Mr. Stafford, let us get her settled in her room, And I'll be out to talk to you, okay? Just answer me. Is she okay? Bullet traveled straight through her chest. Heart and spine were spared, but tore a major artery. We can. We did. But she lost a lot of blood. Whether or not her brain took a hit. "took a hit"? Just wait right here, and I'll be out to explain. Explain it to me now. Her brain was possibly deprived of oxygen. Whether or not she suffered any permanent damage... It's all about the next 24 hours. Man: Blue team to icu, please. Blue team, icu. Jack, I got your message. What's going on? Elaine... what? What did he do? Vic... he shot someone. What? He shot sara. He tried to kill her. I remember one of our first dates. You, um... you dared me To go on a polar swim in the lake. You counted to three, and you jumped in. I just... I stood there. And you actually did it. You were so mad at me. But I remember thinking... "wow. This girl is tougher than I could ever imagine." Do that again. That's good. That's real good. Okay, hold on. Doctor! My wife's waking up. Ginstling: The grand jury is going to indict you. They're deliberating. They are not deliberating. A good prosecutor can get a grand jury To indict a ham sandwich. Drew stafford is a good prosecutor. I pay you a lot of money. Fix it. It's not so simple. Mikolaj is cooperating. He said you ordered the hit on jack. Now, that's gonna add charges to the indictment... Solicitation of murder, conspiracy to commit murder. If they come, I want you to arrange A dignified way for me to surrender. And I'm gonna need some time to handle things. Can I help you? Uh, no, I'm okay. Who are you here to see? Her. Sara, I'm dr. Hoffman. Do you know where you are right now? A hospital. You know who this guy is? He's my husband. Have a seat. I'll let you know when you can go in. Oh. You know what? Uh, I should go. I just wanted to make sure she's all right. What the hell is going on? Quincy theringer, fbi. All karsten allied assets are being frozen, And these offices are closed for business. You need to send your staff home. Have they come here to humiliate me? Not at all, sir. This is unreasonable. He hasn't even been indicted yet. Correction, counselor. He has. It's juicy reading... Lots of bad things. Am I under arrest? The u.S. Attorney, against my advice, Is granting you 24 hours to surrender yourself. In the meantime, I'll be surveilling you. Stray more than 10 miles from the city center Or put yourself into any circumstances That are suspicious, and we will swoop in And haul you away like a run-of-the-mill crook. Hi, pop. D.J. I didn't expect you to be here. I wanted to talk to... May I come in? I know they're arresting you. I heard. Yeah. There's gonna be a trial. I'll probably wind up going to jail. I'm not sure for how long. You beat him before. You... you can do it again. In the meantime, I set up a trust fund There's plenty of money in there for the both of you And for the kids, too. Elaine's gonna be the trustee. You understand what that means? She's in charge. That's right. But if there's anything you need, She'll take care of it... Until I get out. Lainie... I'm so sorry. Get out of this house. I don't want to see you. I never want to see you again. Get out! You can try again, Once things settle down. Is it true, pop? Did you try and have jack killed? It's, uh... It's complicated. People are complicated... The things they do, why they do them. I understand complicated things, pop, More than you may think. Take good care of your sister. How are you holding up? I, uh... I won't be able to visit you anymore after this. Yeah, I know. We're petitioning the court to have you transferred To a psychiatric youth facility. You can't. I'm 17... An adult under the law. Well, we're gonna fight that. Look, vic. There's something I need you to understand. I let you down. I taught you some things that were wrong... Very wrong... That probably led you to being in here. And for that... I am truly sorry. You told me once... To never apologize. Well, that was one of those things. Jack... Have you come to finish the job? Just give me two minutes. I want to explain about... Explain what? I know it looks bad, but I'm gonna get vic some help. If it weren't for your help, Vic would be home right now. And if it weren't for your help, My parents would still be alive. Your parents' death was an accident. My foreman cut some corners with the scaffolding. The joints froze up in the cold. It was windy. So you took me in, and that makes up for it? No. But I'm standing here Because repairing my mistakes is important to me. Yeah. Well, you might have thought of that Before you sent that guy to kill me. Are they here? Ginstling: On their way up. I'll just... just be a minute. ♪ you're nobody ♪ ♪ till somebody ♪ ♪ loves you ♪ It's time. Is he in there? ♪ you're nobody ♪ ♪ till somebody cares ♪ Mr. Karsten, could you please open the door? ♪ you may be king ♪ mr. Karsten! He locked it. What the hell's going on? ♪ as sure as the stars shine above ♪ Oh, god. Bust it down. Bust it down! ♪ you're just nobody ♪ ♪ you're nobody ♪ ♪ till somebody loves you ♪ ♪ so find yourself ♪ ♪ somebody you can love ♪ Elaine: My father wasn't a religious man, But when I learned that his friends from trojkovo Wanted to pay tribute to him here, It, uh, somehow made sense. Community, family, loyalty... This was his religion. This is what he believed in. I've spent much of my life being angry at my father. He did some bad things. But... And I forget who first said this... Um, "forgiveness is an attribute of the strong." And if there's one thing that my father did well, It was to raise me and my brother to be strong. So... To honor my father today, I forgive him. You know, he spent his life desperately working Towards this dream of making it big, Making his mark on the world, But the true legacy that we leave is our children... And our grandchildren. That's all that really matters. It's so important to get it right. All right, now. Invalid coming through. Don't come in the kitchen. I have a surprise. Okay. Well, I had no idea walking up a flight of stairs Would be this hard. Give it time. You went to the funeral? What a mess. I actually felt bad for them. So, listen, you're gonna stay here Until you're back on your feet. Which shouldn't be too long. As much time as you need. Drew... Sorry. Oliver: Bon appétit. What is this? Cinnamon toast. Daddy showed me how to make it all by myself. Oh, well, thanks, love bug! Mm! This is perfect. We've been watching you. We're tracking you. What exactly is the difference between watching and tracking? What he means to say is, The democratic leadership is impressed. We know you have political aspirations. We think that now is your moment. I've certainly thought about running for state's attorney. No, no! Forget state's attorney. I'm talking u.S. Congress. We have a vacant seat in the fifth district, And you're our most viable candidate. You're insane. No, no. We're methodical. We've done the research. We think you can win. You're smart, good-looking, brought down one of chicago's Most notorious criminals. This is what you've been working for your entire career. The timing's complicated. Well, if you're referring to your wife's affair... Well, we should talk about that. I say we own it, dispense with it up front, Move on to the real issues. You do realize we're in the process of getting divorced? You're not divorced yet. You haven't even filed the papers, so don't. Methodical, remember? He told me there's a girl in his class With a crush on him. Wouldn't tell me her name. A crush? Already? He still looks so small when he sleeps. So... I've been approached about running for congress. Really? That's great. That's what you always wanted. They're hoping that I have you Up onstage with me during campaign events. I said that's impossible and our divorce is pending. And they said, "what divorce?" You never filed the paperwork. Yeah, well... I'm just not sure that I want to go back To moving out every three days. Do you? No. But it can't be all about oliver. That wouldn't be good for any of us. It's not just that. I'm not sure you can trust what you're feeling right now Or what you think you might feel. I don't know if either of us can. But we... we don't have to have all of the answers now. But if you want me to be up onstage with you, By your side, just say, and I'll do it. It's your dream. I want you to have it. Man: Yeah, stafford! Elect me to represent the fifth district in washington And I will fight for the future of this state, For our children, For our children's children. That is what matters. That is our legacy. Is it true that your wife was romantically linked To thatcher carson's married son-in-law My opponent is pretty desperate If that's the best he can come up with. Look, I love my wife. Is it a perfect marriage? No, it's not. If you find one, let me know. We love each other. We have a beautiful son together. And, yes, we're going through some things, But that has nothing to do With what I want to do here, now. Where is your wife today, mr. Stafford? My campaign manager wanted them up here with me today, But I'm not gonna do that. They're my family. They're not accessories. They're not tools to be used to advance my career. They're only the most important thing in the world to me. Next question, please. And I will fight for the future of this state, For our children, For our children's children. Dude was kind of a tool, But you got to vote for somebody, I guess. Yeah. I'm not a fan. So, how you been? I didn't expect to see you around here anymore After all that's happened. I was wondering, Do you have any cars that would hold up on a long trip... Something reliable, not too much mileage? You going somewhere? I'm thinking about it. I got this one here. Been fixing it up to resell. New timing belt. Runs a little thirsty, But got only 110,000 miles on it. Sure. This will do fine. Don't even care how much I'm asking, huh? Nice being rich. I'm not paying. You want to trade me a car worth $60k For a beat-up pickup with a bad paint job. Don't need it anymore. Don't want it. Well, hell, go buy yourself whatever you want. You've got enough money. You don't have to be bartering with me. Yeah, but you always liked it, didn't you? Sure, but... Well, would it make you happy driving this thing around? Lots of things would make me happy. Everybody deserves a little happy. I want you to have it. Hey, teej, what's going on? Are you okay? Well, why did I come all the way out here to meet you? Did you know that dad was in love with a woman Before he met mom? Um... No, I didn't. She was a blues singer. She worked a-a-at that place, the green mill, Where he used to work. Uh, it's up on the north side. It's all... it's all in here. I'm gonna get a cup of hot chocolate. Do you want anything? No, thanks. ♪ Um... I'm looking for kayla. Over there. ♪ It's getting harder to see ♪ it's getting harder to breathe ♪ Kayla? Kayla dumond? Do I know you? My name's t.J. Carson. I'm your brother. I didn't even know you existed till a couple of days ago. What made him tell you? He wrote it in a letter. He died. Oh, I'm sorry. He thought you were in detroit, but I found you here. My son and I left michigan after my mother died. We needed a new start. Are you kayla? This is elaine. My boy often asks about this side of the family. Now I got a good story for him. Um, how... how old is he? 15. Oh, here. You need to sign these, lainie. What? What's this about? I want to transfer half of my trust To kayla and her son. T.J... I need you to sign it. I can't do it. Wait, no. Really, I couldn't. I... No, it's... it's okay, kayla. Really, it is. If there's one thing that's true about us, it's that. After all, you're family. So, you lured me all the way out here So you could give away half your money. And to meet our sister. Oh, and one more thing... The best jerky in wisconsin. What happened to your car? I wanted something more practical. Yeah. Why don't you follow me into town? I'm having dinner with val. Actually, lainie, I'm not going back to the city. I've been thinking. I always wanted to go to san francisco, See that big orange bridge. Wait. California? By yourself? For how long? Well, for a while. I had a friend who moved out there last year, And he said he could set me up with a job fixing cars At... at an auto dealer. No, that's not a good idea. You've always been really good to me. You've been the best sister I-I could ever wish for. So, please, don't fight me on this. But it's so far away. You have never even lived by yourself. It's time I started trying to make sense out of my life. I got to stop letting one bad thing That happened to me all those years ago Be my whole story. That's not my story. My story is just beginning. Starting today. Well, why do you have to go so soon? Why can't you just wait a little while? I want to be on my own now. I want to be out in the world. Well, the world's gonna be a better place. I got a postcard from t.J. He was passing through south dakota. Yeah. I, uh... I talked to him this morning. He's in idaho already. He, um, took a break from the drive To do some ice fishing. Selling this place didn't take too long. Sellers' market, I guess. Just feels so fast. Yeah, well, you know, Val's gonna be in college in the fall, And I can't walk by vic's room without... I know. Me neither. I don't know how we missed it, jack. All those years he must have been struggling. How did we not see it? What kind of parents were we? You're a great mother, And you always have been. I didn't hold up my end of the bargain, But I'm trying to make up for that. You, uh, start that new job yet? Uh, no. No, next week. Well, I hope you enjoy it. Yeah. Me, too. I'll... I'll talk to you soon. Abdaze: I wash cars on the street, odd jobs. I have saved the money. I can buy her a plane ticket. But still, they tell me no. Mr. Abdaze, this is out of our jurisdiction. Please. An orphan girl in the camps. She'll be raped, killed. Okay, hold on. Hey, grant. Can I talk to you? Ah, two minutes. Go. You see that guy? A somalian refugee with a 6-year-old niece Recently orphaned in a camp outside mogadishu. Now, he wants to fly her over, But since she's not immediate family, Do you know how many people would show up at our borders If we started letting in extended family? Everyone is a cousin if you look hard enough. Look, I know someone at the state department I could call... look, you know what? And I know you're used to getting things your own way. But these kinds of problems... They're too big, all right? You can't fix them. So, I have to do a volunteer project for school, And I was thinking that maybe I can do An internship for you here. Well, this place is pretty chaotic. I mean, it's cool, though. I think it's great that you're doing it. How was the college tour? It was good. Mom drove me a little crazy. You're just like her... You're tough, brave. She said you like n.Y.U. Yeah. Um, but I'm not so sure anymore. I'm thinking maybe of taking a year off To travel throughout europe. Jules has always wanted to see Italy, so... What? Bad idea? I was gonna say that, yeah. You know, tell you not to do it, "go to college," all the normal parent stuff. And then I realized what a hypocrite I'd be. Do you love jules? Yeah, I think I do. You know, I spent too many years just going with the flow, You know, not being deliberate with my life, my choices. You don't get happy just by accident? You got to make it happen. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that. Come on. Fare's on me. I can't. I'm meeting up with jules. But will you see about the internship? Sure. Bye. Thank you. None of us would have... I... and I never... Oh, god. Anything I try to say about vic Just comes out sounding so... Inadequate. You never came to the hospital. Well, I heard you were stable, And then elaine told me you were discharged, So I-I thought you were okay. You know, it's late. I should get going. Yeah. Me, too. Where are you living now? Oh, high-rise a couple of blocks that way. Sounds nice. You know, it's easy. It's got a nice view of the water. Well, it was nice to see you. Take care. Woman: Excuse me, alderman, Can I please get a comment for the herald? Alderman. She's the one Who took millions in bribes from the unions? She looks like my junior-high principal. Think we can get the times to run it? Well, they owe us. This is like the third scoop we've given them in two weeks. Look at you, all "they owe us." You're cocky. I like it. I ran into jack. Whoa. It was awful, like we were strangers. Well, maybe that's for the best. I mean, if drew wins, you're moving to d.C., right? I don't know. We haven't really talked about it. Dude, that's like a major elephant in the room... Or at least a very large dog, Like a mastiff. Are you and drew back together or not? I'm not sure. Neither of us is. Went up another five points in the polls. If this keeps up, I'll pass daniels By the end of the month. Um... Then what? We... we all move to d.C. Together? Drew... Do we know what we're doing here? Are we just playing house? I mean, this... This time together, it's... It's felt good. It's... Felt right. But I'm... I'm worried. Worried that we're chasing something, Something that we lost. Maybe we never really had it. We were too young and dumb To realize we weren't doing it right. But these past few months, I really feel like we found something... A deeper understanding of each other. And I know that it's crazy, Backwards, and all this crap... This whole nightmare. Maybe we had to go through all of it to get this close... To end up here. You ever see d.C. When the cherry blossoms are in bloom? It's pretty excellent. When you told me last month you were going to get her, I had no idea it would happen so fast. Well, we got lucky with the relief flight. It's more than luck, mr. Mcallister. You know that. It's nice to meet you, fascika. She wants you to have it. Thank you. Aw, I love it. Good luck, mr. Abdaze. Stay in touch. Sara: New job? A place like this could have really helped your parents. Exactly. I got to catch a train. Well, I'll walk you. I couldn't leave things the way we did the other day. The conversation, it was just... Terrible. Yeah. Look... Why did you come here? What do you want from me, sara? I want to know why you never came to see me At the hospital. Maybe I rushed to the hospital from the police station After vic was booked. Maybe I got within 10 feet of the room and turned around. Why? Why would you do that? For once I decided to do the right thing. But is never seeing each other again the right thing? Because I don't know. Seeing you that day on the el platform, I can't stop asking myself that question. Yeah. Me, neither. I got to go. Have a good night. ♪ Take my mind, and take my pain ♪ ♪ like an empty bottle takes the rain ♪ ♪ and heal, heal ♪ heal, heal ♪ and take my past, and take my sins ♪ ♪ like an empty sail takes the wind ♪ ♪ and heal, heal ♪ heal, heal ♪ and tell me some things last ♪ and tell me some things last Hi.
