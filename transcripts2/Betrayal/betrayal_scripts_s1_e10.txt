 It's all in here. T.J. Was with lou the night he was killed. The gun used to kill lou was found in your son's car. All evidence points to your son, t.J. That evidence doesn't hold water. Why would t.J. Kill lou? Because you told him to. I sent my brain-damaged son to kill his uncle? You're not thinking very clearly, mr. Stafford. He's turned you upside down. Who? Jack. It's what he does. He manipulates people. I'm not being manipulated by jack mcallister. Please. Of course you are. Look what he's done to you, what he's taken from you. You leave her out of this. Leave her out of it? You really don't get it, do you? You think jack sleeping with your wife was an accident, That it was a coincidence That you were assigned to the mrozek case?

Didn't t.J. Ask about it? No. No. "hey, guys, I left a murder weapon in my trunk. It's not like getting a couple quarters Swiped out of your car at the car wash. It's kind of a big deal. I told you what happened. Well, see, I feel like you're just telling me What I want to hear. It's not very helpful to me. Now, I am done playing around with you! You understand me? Who drove that impala in here? T.J. Where was the gun? In the trunk, in the lid. Who found it? I did. What did t.J. Say when he realized it was gone? Nothing. He didn't realize it was gone. He never knew it was there. How do you know that? Because I took it out. I showed him the trunk lid with the gun gone. He had no idea. That is the truth. Whoever put that gun in that car... it was not t.J. I'll be back. We're a long way from me offering you a beer. Dude, we need to have a serious talk. Elaine: What do you know about teenagers? Aidan: They like to ride skateboards. They have a lot of sex. They play with their phones. We're talking about vic, right? Yeah. Did he say why he did it? He's not a great communicator right now. Everything's gonna be fine. He's a kid. Kids have problems. What were your kid problems? Matt mclychok. He tripped me when I was on crutches in seventh grade. That and girls. Girls were a problem, too. Oh, yeah? Too many? Yeah. No... well, it can get complicated. What the hell? License and registration. And what's the problem, officer? Problem right now is you leaning over and talking to me. License and registration. Okay. About a half-mile back, you made an illegal left turn. What? No, we didn't. Ma'am, there was a sign. Now, sit back in your seat and stop yelling. Yelling? I wa... I wasn't yelling! I can yell if you want me to! Let me... let me just... jerk. Sir... Oh, my god. Do not make a move. Officer... And you... not a sound. Just give us a second there, ma'am. Can we go on a date? Sara: The two of us? Well, unless quincy theringer shows up, Yes, just the two of us. I'd like that. Tonight, 7:30, grand avenue bridge. It's a date. Yes, it is. I'm sorry about your girl. But you got to tell me, boss, right now, straight up, How did that gun get in your car? That wasn't my gun, rodney. I got that. How did it get in your car? I didn't even know it was in my car. For the love of god, brother. I know who put it there. Okay. Good. Who? It wasn't me. Who was it? The person who killed lou. You know who that was? Y-you call me over here about jaywalking? This is chicago. It was through traffic. He's not himself. Well, I wouldn't know. You know, he doesn't talk to me. Neither does val. Really, jack? Feeling sorry for yourself? Are you okay? I'm fine. Elaine. You know, there's a thing with aidan At the... you know, the wine... Well, that makes one of us. And what does that mean? We had this thing with a cop. Yeah, he pulled us over, and he was a total jerk. He threw aidan on the hood. And then just like that, he walks away smiling. No ticket. Nothing. I don't know. It was weird. Hmm. I'll check it out. No, I don't want you to check it out. What I want you to do is talk to our son. That's what I want you to do. I'll try. I'm trying. I'm busy. I want to talk about the mrozek case. Coinkidink. Because I do not want to talk about the mrozek case. Because I don't care about the mrozek case. And even if I did care about the mrozek case, which I do not, I don't have any jurisdiction over the mrozek case, So there wouldn't be anything to talk about. Do you still want to talk about the mrozek case? Yes. I think you might think I'm a therapist. I am not a therapist. But therapy could be good for you. I need your advice. I have a suspect, some evidence. The person who told me about the suspect, The person who gave me said evidence... I don't trust him. How would you proceed if you were me? Well, what if you really wanted to? Then I would ask myself why I really wanted to. Please, just help me out here, will you? How do I test information provided by a known liar? Honestly, I'd make sure the witnesses were good, drew. It's always about the witnesses. There are witnesses, right? You look beautiful. Thank you. Sorry I'm late. How's the studio? Soggy. I broke down and called my landlord. And? He told me to call my lawyer. I was thinking we could get some dinner. What? I-is there a food truck coming by? Over here. Trust me. Are we squatting? 'cause I just did a story on this, And it doesn't end well. We're not squatting. Whose house is this? Ours. Frank perkins? Matthew hendricks. I was told it was frank perkins. That was a fake name. We're not off to a great start. Matthew hendricks is my real name. Well, my real name is drew stafford. I'm an assistant state's attorney. Thatcher karsten tells me that you may have Some information about the murder of lou mrozek. Sara: We need some curtains. Yeah. And a refrigerator. We don't have a refrigerator? Or a toaster. Or heating. Or a bed. But the plumbing is amazing. I remember when you said That you wanted a place overlooking the river. It's exactly like I pictured it. Well, you did actually show me a picture. Sara, I know this was... Presumptuous. Jack. It's a lease, though. So, you know, if you don't like it... I love it. I love it. I love that we have something of ours. Thanks. Lou and I were partners in a company called Multinational builders corp. It was a flyer, really... Something we set up Just in case we landed Some spin-off karsten allied development, okay? So, anyway, one day, jack approaches me. He says he wants to use the company For some "transactional funding" for a new project. Let's cut to it, frank. Or matthew or whatever the hell your name is. Matthew. Matthew. Great. Look, jack was embezzling. He was routing money out of karsten allied Through your company... Is that right? I-I was not totally aware of that at the time, but yes. Okay, look, I kept my head down, okay? I admit that. But I have a family. Somebody from karsten allied Eventually caught on to the missing money. Lou's name being on the company looked pretty bad. So lou panicked. He went to the feds. Jack got to him before he could talk and killed him. Am I missing anything? Yeah, lou's wife, connie. Connie mrozek. What about her? Jack wanted to kill her, too. Well, she knew about the money. She knew jack killed lou. I helped her escape. Do you know where she is right now? You have a checkered past, mr. Hendricks... Failed businesses, multiple aliases, Questionable associations. I'm inclined not to believe you about any of this. We're talking about a dead man here, mr. Stafford. Now, say what you will about me, But I've never come close to that kind of thing, And I am scared, man. I am scared of jack. I've been in hiding ever since He came looking for me a few days after he shot lou. So you can believe me, or I can disappear again. This is a donut the size of south dakota. Oh, I wish I could stay here all day. I'm going to stay here all day. Thanks. Have you given any thought to what you're gonna do now? Oh, no. Am I already the slacker guy hanging around the house? Stop. I'm serious. Nate gave me some homework. Other than that... I don't really know. You must have had other career ideas when you were young. What did you want to be? Spider-man. Tricky. We'll need to work on this. Yeah. Did you turn up anything on him? No. Not what I expected. Thanks. Hey. Jack: Hey. Do you have a few minutes? I need to talk to you about something. Sara: Hi. What happened? Oh, a pipe burst. I think I might be moving. Really? Where to? Oh, somewhere with better plumbing. Here. Come sit down. Yeah. I'm really glad you came. I am, too. All right. Right here? Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. All right. Do I look like I'm rising. You are. And oliver is so proud. Having his dad out there, catching all the bad guys. I'm rising. Yeah. All right. Great. Sara... I think jack might be one of the bad guys. Drew, no. I'm serious. I'm worried for you. Please don't do this. I'm worried for you. You're worried? Sara, please. Just please just listen. Drew, come on, now. I think jack might have killed lou mrozek. What?! Look, just stop for one second and listen to me. There is evidence. The coincidence of this whole thing... Jack miraculously shows up in your life Right when I'm closing in on the karstens, Right when lou goes to the fbi, And right when lou gets killed. Think about it. It makes no sense. It never has. Hey. I bought a toaster. The pop-up kind, not the one with a door. I like the bread popping up. Hey, can you hand me that screwdriver? Thank you. Did you see me at that party before the balcony? The balcony? The night we met. Uh, you were wearing a red dress. But you didn't see me. Uh, no. I don't think I saw you. So if I hadn't come out on the balcony... You okay? You wanted the toaster with the door, didn't you? Oh, I saw drew this morning. He came by the studio. Really? Why? He's very into the mrozek case again. The mrozek case? He doesn't think t.J. Did it. Well, he didn't. But why is he talking to you about this? That's totally inappropriate. I mean, the case is closed. Who do you think did it? Who do I think killed lou mrozek? I have no idea, sara. That kid lil' d, I guess. Not t.J. But why are we talking about this? I was just curious. About lou mrozek? You know, I don't want to talk about that. Is that okay? Vic's agreed to see me. I should go. Aidan: Yo. Yo. Thanks for coming. New menu, hot chef. I wouldn't miss it. So, who can I talk to about getting... Oh, I don't know... That table by the window? Well, that is a table for two. And, uh, there's three of us. Three? Mm-hmm. Oh, is it the seafood guy? It's not the seafood guy, is it? No. It's my dad. You, me, and my dad. Come on. It'll be fun. Sauvignon blanc... Zesty with hints of peach and wet stone. Stop with the gibberish. It's not gibberish. Wet stone? Dad, aidan wants to ask you some questions. I do? What questions? I thought so. About what? About your business. About his business? What about my business? Yeah, that's why you're here, right? No, you invited me to lunch. I'm enjoying the wine. Thank you. Just pretending to be a wine salesman. Really? Why? No, she's kidding. I'm not kidding. Do you collect wine, mr. Karsten? Why are you pretending to be a wine salesman? Well, go ahead. You can tell him. You don't have anything to hide, do you? Oh, I'm sorry, lainie. I've got to go. Okay. Thanks for the lunch. You better answer her question. Hey. I'm doing this for mom. Hey. You feeling better? Yeah. I'm going out with vic for a bit. Maybe when I come back, we could catch up. Yeah, that sounds great, dad. All right. Wait. Jack. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Sure. When I come back. I got a call from the fbi. The fbi? About karsten. Quincy something-or-other. Okay. I don't know what to do. That's okay. It's all right. Do you remember when you asked me to destroy documents? That was a good thing. Trust me. That's not a problem. There is a problem. The problem is I didn't destroy the documents. I kept a copy. Where are they? I think they're safe. Did you say anything to her, quincy theringer? Okay. All right. We'll talk when I get back. You and me... we'll figure this out, all right? Okay. Drew: Why would jack set up t.J.? Oh, there's a history there. A long history. Jealousy, bitterness. T.J. Is my son. Jack was always envious of that. He defended him, though. He had no choice. Anyway, that's jack... Playing all the angles. Frame him, then get him off. Act like the hero. I'm gonna need more records, more witnesses. Whatever you need. You may have to testify. Of course. I'm gonna need immunity. Broad immunity. Is that what this is all about? I'm exposed here already. I need some protection. You must understand that. I'm not gonna immunize your entire life for this. You need to think very carefully, mr. Stafford, About how you're going to proceed. You have a real opportunity To reclaim your life, your career, To recover your reputation on the very case That brought you considerable disrepute. Versus what? A bird in the hand, mr. Stafford? I haven't seen you for a while, vic. I was hoping we could talk. About what? Anything. How's school? Fine. Any more meets this fall? I'm not wrestling. You know, I could send you an e-mail of my schedule, If that's what you want. It's not what I want. I want to talk to you. You know, when I was your age, my dad was dead. Lucky you. That's enough! I don't deserve this from you! Vic, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that. Look, I'm sorry for what I did to your mom. I'm sorry I'm not at home anymore. I'm sorry for everything. I just want to be your dad. Please. Just tell me what's bothering you. Please. I know who killed uncle lou. What? And I think you do, too, dad. Bye. Thanks for coming. Can I just say... I don't know anything about my dad's business or jack's, So whatever time that you spent here or in my house, Sniffing around like a little fbi rodent was all a waste. It was my job. Your job was to have sex with me? So you're a prostitute. So if that's not your job, then you suck at your job. You suck at your real job and your fake job. You suck. You said you didn't care who I was. That was before I knew that you were a total dick, And I want you to take offense at that. I really do like you, elaine. Well, I don't like you. They're looking into the mrozek murder again. It's someone in your family. Thought that you should know. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you for telling me about him. You talked to the kids, told them to reach out to me. You're their father. I appreciate it. Look, I just left vic at home. You need to go there now. Is everything okay? I have to go. I'll explain later. Hey. Good boy. Thanks for meeting me. Who are you? Quincy theringer, fbi. I'm not meeting you. You just showed up here. Oh, yes. That's right. I did. Anyway, this could be a productive relationship. I'm in a relationship. You help me with karsten, I help you with the irs. I don't have any problems with the irs. And I can't help you with karsten. You don't have anything incriminating against karsten? I don't even know what that means. You're not hiding anything. No. Documents? No. What if we searched your house? Searched my house? No. Well, we'll find out in about 20 minutes. What are you saying, jack? O-okay, okay. Okay, I will. I promise. Okay, bye. Everything all right, boss? Can you drive me somewhere? I got a shop to run here. The person I told you about who killed lou... He's in trouble. Please. Do you remember that night a few months ago When you called me asking for help to find the magic book? Where's oliver? He's at ethan's. Do you remember? Yeah. The giraffe book. You were away. I was with jack. You want to talk to a detective? Drew: You were with jack that night? I was here alone with oliver, and you were with jack. Yes. Why are you telling me this now, sara? Why are you trying to hurt me? I'm trying to help you here. Lou mrozek was killed that night. You sure you know what you're doing? Sara: Do you know what time? Yes. Why? What time? Why? He was killed between 8:10 and 8:25. You called me at 8:23 asking for help to find the book. Jack was standing next to me when I talked to you. We were at dune acres, An hour away from where lou was killed. Jack didn't kill lou mrozek. It's impossible. My name is jack mcallister.
