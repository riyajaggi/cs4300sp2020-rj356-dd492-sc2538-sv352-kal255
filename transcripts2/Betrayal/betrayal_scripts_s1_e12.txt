This one gets us the pulitzer. Fraud, threats, chicago real estate. I killed lou mrozek. I didn't know he carried a gun. I lunged, wrestled it from his hands, And it was in self-defense.

 Why would he lie?! Because it was his son. Vic! Even if jack didn't do it, he is a bad guy. I don't want him around you. I don't want him around oliver. It is not safe. I love you, but I just can't be with you. You want me to give up karsten. If you leave out one thing, If karsten forgot to change a blown bulb on a scaffolding And you don't tell me about it... Then you're coming after me. No. I'll go after your son. Drew: You were employed

 By thatcher karsten for the past 18 years. Is that correct, mr. Mcallister? Yes, it is. Are you prepared to give thorough and truthful testimony To this grand jury, as per your obligation under law And the immunity provided to you? I am. I would like to direct your attention to March 2011 To a karsten allied development site on the near north side. Was this building ever inspected? No, it was not. Why not? Because the inspector was paid off. $347,000. $1.7 million. All of which is documented on a company flash drive Provided to this jury By karsten allied I.T. Worker juliet whitman? Other... Methods of persuasion were often employed? He was roughed up. Her family was threatened. His knees were shattered. Who ordered that? It was thatcher karsten. I saw... yes, it was thatcher karsten. Correct. Thatcher karsten. Are you familiar with alderman bernard arkovich? Could you please explain to the jury what happened next? Thatcher picked up a nail gun And nailed mr. Arkovich's hands to the slab. All because the good alderman Wouldn't vote to rezone his property? Correct. Did mr. Karsten explain his actions? No. All he said was, "chicago never changes." Well, apparently, it does. How long before they hand down an indictment? Could be a few weeks. Grand juries go slow. And then what kind of prison time will he be looking at? Optimistically, 5 to 10, I'm guessing. Seriously? I gave you assault, tax fraud, bribery... Hey, karsten's connections run deep, And none of the individual charges is a home run. 5 to 10 will be a win. 18 years' worth of testimony, And all you can pin him on is 5 to 10? With good behavior, he'll be out in three. He's a 70-year-old man. Any clout he had in this town... It's done. Stick a fork in him. What more do you want? George: Stafford. Georgie-p! Thought we lost you downstate. Springfield's a bunch of animals. Do yourself a favor... Stay out of politics. How the hell are you? Good. Family? Ollie's 7. He's in first grade. Wow. Sara? Uh, she just won a big photojournalism award. Good to hear. Let's get the kids together sometime. We'd love it. All right. Coming. Drew: Hey. Hey. Sorry it's such a mess. Movers come Thursday. So, you found a new place? Yeah, a, uh, one-bed in roscoe village. That's close. Yeah, I thought it would make pickups and drop-offs easier. Modern lit. My senior year. You always sat in the back. You, in the front. Until I met you. So, uh, your attorney looked these over. You just sign the tabs. It's four places, I think. The last one's the custodial arrangement, And I'm a little embarrassed by it 'cause it sounds so much harsher on paper. It just stipulates that... that I not see jack. No, I know. Well, uh... I guess... what? I'll see you at ollie's next soccer game. Yeah. Yeah. Well, take care, then. You, too, drew. ♪ Great. What the hell are you doing, hanley? I thought we worked through this. "triple-a travel guide"... Selling america's family-friendly city. You are a photojournalist. Say it with me. "I am a..." Single mom who needs a salary with benefits. And an award-winning photojournalist. One award. The chicago press award is no joke. I mean, I don't even think a photographer has even won it In like 10 years, so you can't bail on the event. Plus, there's this cute intern who works the metro desk... Total geek-girl vibe going... straight up my alley. Hmm. She's helping me with this thing. Freelance piece... a series of construction violations Spanning the past few decades. Uh, something jack had me look into... Something with his family. But, uh, will you shoot these properties for me? Yeah. Sure. Thank you. See you tomorrow. 7:00. It's not good. Grand jury... they're sniffing through everything, Going way back. I've survived grand juries before. Mcallister's talking. What about? Briberies, payouts, tax evasion... Even assault and battery. If that grand jury buys what he's selling, It's only a matter of time before you're in cuffs. Look, I've always liked jack, but he's a problem for you now. For me? You think those bastards are gonna spare some dirty cop Who's been on the take for 10 years? That they're not thinking how good your face is gonna look On the front page next to mine? Just do what I pay you for. I want those documents. Juror names, phone numbers... the grand juries are sealed, secret. You... you think I can just waltz into the judge's chamber And ask for the case files? Well, then maybe you can waltz yourself right into stateville. I hear it's like most other prisons. They don't like cops. Shut him up, or I will. Or someone working for him. And you say this because why? The guy in the photo... It's karsten's son-in-law. Well, do we need to check in on him, Make sure he's not in any danger? He's fine. I was with him all morning. He's a key witness In the sealed grand jury case against thatcher karsten, And that's what this is all about. "shut him up"... Shut up my witness, mcallister. And the two of you are... In a relationship? We were. It's over. It has been for weeks now. I need you to keep an eye on this place, Put a surveillance detail on it... as a favor to me? Uh, do you have a safe place to stay for the time being, ma'am? Yes. She does. I'm fine. I am. I'm focusing on school, and things are good. Actually, I have a history paper I'm behind on, so... Vic, schoolwork's not what we're asking about. Honey, sit down. We... We just... We don't ever want you to feel like you're by yourself in this. Yeah, it's just, you know, what happened with lou... I know. I get it. It needs to stay between us. Right, but we want you to know That you can talk to us about it. Yeah, we've had this conversation before, But I don't need to talk about it. I'm good. Really. Look. What happened happened. I'm sorry for it... I am... But there's no good looking back. Looking back on what? Uh, we were just talking about vic's schoolwork. Why? Did you flunk out? No, shut up. Val, sit down. There's something we need to tell you... both of you. Your grandfather is probably about to be indicted By a grand jury for some serious crimes. He may be arrested soon. What? Why? There's a bunch of things that have been going on For a long time. Look, you need to be prepared. There may be some media attention because... Well, the fact is, I'm testifying against him. Wait, hold on. You're... and a lot of things are gonna come out... You know, ugly things. Why would you do that? Because it's the right thing to do. Look, he's still your grandfather. You know, he still loves you. But you're turning on him. Why? I mean... a-and after all the things you did for me, Why would you be such a hypocrite?! Vic, don't. What are you talking about? Nothing. What does that... A hypocrite for what? Tell me! Fine. You know what? Forget it. You know, this has been totally vague and completely disturbing. I like it's all of us for dinner. Is it gonna be every night? Um, no, sweetie. Just for a while. Aw, how long? I don't know. As long as your mom needs to stay here. Yes! And can we also watch a movie together after dinner? All three of us? Why not? We can make ice-cream sundaes! And at bedtime, will you both read me a story... First daddy, then mommy... Like we used to? Absolutely. This is gonna be amazing! Okay. So, val knows something's up. You heard her earlier. Yeah. Well, what are we doing, jack? These last few months, it's all been too much for them, And now their grandfather... I just... I don't know how we can expect Two teenagers to manage all of this. Do you want me to not testify? No, but I do think you need to be More involved in their lives. Well, I am involved. You are not here, And they're at an age where they're not gonna seek you out. You want me to move back in? Well, obviously, that's not a good idea, But I-I do think you need to be here more. Okay. Well, I'll... I'll come by after school during the week. Okay, yeah, you can help them with their homework, Watch a movie, whatever. I just... I want them to know that they can count on us, That they're not alone. We owe them that. Sara: Thanks for letting me stay, drew. Well, I'm heading to bed. You have everything you need? You know what? Why don't I stay on the couch? You go sleep in the bed. No. It's fine, sara. Anything less would be unchivalrous. Absolutely not. It's your week with oliver. You get the bed. You... you better move because I am sleeping on this couch, And you know I kick when I sleep. Tonight was nice. It was. Go to your room. Well, good night. Night. We sh... we shouldn't. Mm. We're here... Now. Let's not worry about later. Mom, get up. Ohh. Ooh. Mm. Where's my morning hug? Come on, mom. It's time for pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! I think maybe your son wants some pancakes. Yeah. Sleep all right? Uh, yeah. Are we okay? Yeah, of course. I just... I don't want it to be confusing. No, I mean, we just... We got a little carried away. That's all... A little nostalgic. Right. That's all. We're good. Mom, dad, where's the maple syrup? Coming! I got your message about the break-in. I'm fine. Really. You didn't need to come over. Well, I wanted to. You sure you're okay? You know, you... You can't stay here. I'm not. I'm back home. Uh, at least you're not alone. I heard about your award. It's great. I'm glad things are going well for you. I have to go. Hey. No work? Oh, I-I took the day off. Where's your brother? Suddenly, he's in model u.N. He's mr. Extracurricular. He's developing interests. I-I think that's good. Do you? Because I think it's pretty weird. I want to know what's going on. What do you mean? Please don't. I'm not an idiot. I walk into the room, and everyone stops talking. You barely leave the house, And I don't even know who vic is anymore. He's going through a rough time. Obviously, but why? Y-your father and the investigation. No, vic has been acting crazy for months, Way before any of this stuff happened. What is it? You can't keep it from me forever. You don't say a word about this to anyone... Not jules, not your friends, anyone. Orjuela: Stafford. What happened? Is sara okay? Yeah, she's fine. But there's something else. Took this outside her place today. Sorry to be the messenger here. Jack: Look, we have to do better than 5 to 10. Brandy korskaya was working with the feds. Karsten knew that. Now, I'm sure he had her killed. We've been over this. There's zero proof linking karsten to korskaya's death. If there were, then maybe we'd stand... Stafford, so glad you finally decided to join us. What are you doing, stafford?! Have you lost your mind?! Hey, I need some help in here! I went by to check on her. I heard she'd been threatened. Looks like more than checking. Yeah, well, it wasn't. Until today, I hadn't seen her for weeks. Is that the truth? Do you really think she'd be living with you back home If we were still together? So you're not seeing her? No, she made it very clear That she didn't want me in her life. Who took those photos anyway? I had police surveillance on her. I was worried. You think he'll make a move? Karsten? I know he will. The man's vengeful, and he's got a long memory. I'll tell you, if he gets out in three to five, We'll be looking over our shoulder For the rest of our lives... And not just us, everyone we care about. So, what are you saying? Look, zarek pawlowski once told me That he took care of brandy. And it was pretty clear that it was under karsten's request. But zarek is gone. The feds searched high and low for him To give a statement and turned up nothing. And without zarek, all we've got is hearsay. I'm telling you, we do that, we get karsten for murder one And he goes away, not just for a little while... For good. Threats, harassment... This guy messed with the wrong person. It's gonna make some juicy copy for somebody. Hey, did you got photos of all this? I filed a police report. That's enough. Oh. I got you... Pepper spray... Mace... wait for it... Okay... Mini taser. Why don't you just clean? You got to fight back. You show karsten you're not scared. I mean, threatening you to get to jack? There was no point. Jack won't back down. You spoke to jack? I've been trying to reach him for weeks. Yeah, he... He came by the studio. He wanted to... Check I was okay. Hey, um... I mean, you don't have to talk about it, But, like, what happened between you two? W-why did you guys break up? Jack got into this situation where drew was convinced That he did something, something criminal, Even though jack was completely innocent. And drew wouldn't drop it? No, so... I promised never to see jack again. And the truth is that when I finally ended it with him, Part of me felt relieved, like both of us should just move on. And then I see him today and all that goes out the window And the feeling comes right back. You know, some people go their whole lives And never feel something like that. What's going on? I'm going to jules. Why? Did something happen? Don't come near me. What the hell's wrong with you? The whole damn time, it was you, And you let t.J. Take the blame, and... and dad... I didn't let anyone. Oh, you are so full of crap. And now you've gotten away with it. Congratulations. You make me sick. You know we could have taken one car. Let's not take this whole working-together thing too far. It's nice the way you gunned it past me at the light. You gonna cut me off at every intersection? Damn straight. No one's seen him in months. I'm guessing he cleared out of town And is laying low somewhere. What is that? It smells like a zoo in here. Maybe he went back to the motherland. What kind of guy leaves his dog at home to starve? A guy who doesn't know he's not coming back. John doe found in abandoned vehicle last week? No, that's not him. This one was found in a burned-down building. Right time frame. Yeah, but his height... 5"7'. He's too short. So, let me ask you... Zarek... he comes after you And says, "oh, by the way, I offed brandy." Why didn't you do anything about it then? I didn't have any proof. But you're right. I turned a blind eye to a lot of things. I'm not proud of it. Body here... dumped in a river, Missing its head and its hands. No dental records, no fingerprints. Could be him, but no way to know for sure... Wait. Wait. That's from the polish national coat of arms. It's the same thing that's on his wall. Without zarek to testify, we can't connect karsten to brandy. There's no murder charge. Doesn't matter. Now we know karsten killed zarek. No doubt karsten's a killer, And dumping him in a river? He's got people who take care of the details. People like you, you mean? I never did anything like that. Your hands are clean. Look, there were lines I never crossed, No matter how much he wanted me to, Which is why I'm here with you. You got it? Okay, then. How do we connect karsten with the murder With a dead trigger man and no hard evidence? You're the fixer. Fix it. Orestes: You shot zarek, Then had his body dumped in the river, Minus the head and hands. Jack's recounted the whole thing. How the hell did he come up with all that? He says he saw you do it. He's claiming he was there. I didn't think he had the stones. So, what are you gonna do about it? Witaj przyjacielu. Witaj przyjacielu. Come. Musimy porozmawiac. Of course. Watch the store, please, noah. Jerzy: These young men... They have no idea. They never struggled. How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have a thankless child. This is true. My son hates me. That crazy boy in there, noah... He's easier to talk to than my own son. Screw them. Someday, they will be old men like us. Then they will see. Yeah. But by then, we'll be dead. Na zdrowie. Right now, we are still alive, my friend. His name is mikolaj. He's the man you need. When the branch is rotten, you must cut it off Before it infects everything. Hey, don't answer your phone much? Hey. I'm sorry. I've been busy. In fact, I got to be somewhere right now. I have something for you. It's about that thing you asked me to look into... You know, your parents. Yeah, they died in a karsten allied Construction accident... Building collapsed. I know that already. Yeah, precisely. That's it. What's it? That's all the available info. I checked city records, hospital archives... nada. No accident report, no police report, no death certificates. Your parents were undocumented immigrants, Easier to make disappear. Even the building-code paperwork was destroyed in a fire One week after the accident. Someone scrubbed it all. Not someone. I'm sorry. I know he raised you. You want this now? Thanks for looking into it. You going to the opening? What? Sara's opening. Uh, no. No. Somewhere else. You know, I probably shouldn't say anything, But, um, sara had to break things off with you. She didn't want to. What do you know about that? Not much more. You should ask her. Opening goes till 9:00. You sure he's still here. He said he'd wait. He sounded very upset. You're a good man, t.J., looking out for him like this. That's loyalty. There's nothing more important than that. There he is. Grandpa, what are you doing here? I was worried about you. We both were. W-what's going on? Y-y-you said something about val? Yeah, just that she hates me now... Everybody does. They don't hate you. You don't understand. I did something terrible. You mean what happened to lou? What do you know about that? So much for keeping it a secret. Hey. You don't keep secrets from family. Everything that's happening is my fault. No, it isn't. You're not to blame for any of this. Lou had a vicious temper. We all knew that. He could have hurt you badly. You did what you had to do to defend yourself. That doesn't make you wrong. It makes you human. Your father is right to protect you. That's what a father is supposed to do. Only, ever since that woman came into his life, He can't seem to get his priorities straight. Jerzy says you know how to follow instruction. The old man does not lie. Quick and painless. And not in the face. He wants it to be an open casket. Okay, mikolaj? Instead of protecting the family, he's destroying it. Life can force you into making a very hard choice... Even if that choice Is the last thing you ever wanted to do. All these people want to come to see your pictures? Yeah, I guess they do. Did you take any, like, sports? Um, no. Look at this crowd. I know. I know. You hate crowds. Here... crowd medicine. Oh, that's the first project Your mom and I ever worked on together. Is that when you got arrested? Badge of honor. You know your mom's a badass, right? You know, this... all of this is entirely your fault. No, outlaw. All you. What are you gonna say in your speech? What speech? They're giving you an award. You got to say something... No speech. All right, kiddo. See that lovely creature at the dessert table? The lady, you mean? Yeah. We're gonna go talk to her. Sure. And look, any joke I make, you laugh at like it's so funny, And then you tell her how awesome I am Because I build forts with you after school. But you don't do that. Doesn't matter. Follow my lead. Drink up. It'll help you with the speech. Hey, jack. Hey. Cold night. It's like summer in dublin. Let's go over here. Drop it! Now! Man: Clear! Man ♪2:Clear! Let's go. Hey, man. Nice fall. Kevlar, eh? It'd be a damn shame if his aim were a bit higher. Thanks, orestes. You did the right thing. Got it all right here. We get this bastard to admit he's working with karsten, Nail him on conspiracy to commit murder. Done. Everybody gets what they wanted. Guess you could say that. You good? Somewhere I got to be. Just help me get this thing off. No more looking over our shoulders. Karsten's done. I thought I could stay. Well, it's too late, and you saw the fun part. Anyway, janey's here. She's gonna put you to bed. Aw, mom. She said she's gonna read you two books. Okay. Hi, sara. Hey. Hi, oliver. Hey. Okay. All right, bye, love bug. Bye, mom. Bye. Bye. My mom said two books. Okay, then. Jack! I'm glad you decided to come. Where's sara? Uh, she stepped out for a minute. She'll be right back. You know, I'm... I'm actually gonna go and find her. What the hell was that?
