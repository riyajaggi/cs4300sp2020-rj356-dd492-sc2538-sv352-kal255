Uh, I don't know what you're talking about. That time in the kitchen when jack and dad were there. Y-you told me to say... She's out. We got nothing. Come on, ollie, get your jacket. We're gonna be late. Which one? The denim one. Where is it? I don't know. Where did you last leave it? I don't know. Well, try your room. Sara: How'd you sleep? Good. Look. The necklace... You and ollie gave it to me For christmas two years ago, remember? Ollie picked it out. Come on, mom. Sara: Okay, boss man. All right. See you later. See you. Bye. Bye, dad. See you! Stafford, this is goss. Cpd wants you down at a crime scene. Says it's urgent. I'll check it out, but I suggest you call me as soon as you can. Detective mitchell. Yeah, who wants to know? Interim director of the state's attorney's office, Criminal division... Taking over for abrams. Good for you. Where's stafford? I wish I knew. Maybe you can explain to me Why you wanted an a.S.A. Down at a routine crime scene. Well, maybe it's not so routine. Neighbors reported gunfire around 4:00 a.M. Mitchell: Looks like an attempted robbery. Kid didn't even make it inside. Tragic. And? We ran the kid's gun... A .38 registered to a one louis mrozek. The victim in the t.J. Karsten case. But here's where it gets interesting. The bullets they took out of mrozek... also from a .38. How much you want to bet they match? You're saying mrozek was killed with his own gun? By a kid with a rap sheet a mile long. He's done time for car theft, larceny. This is the guy you're looking for... not t.J. Karsten. Stafford's had it all wrong from the start. Look, I haven't been able to get ahold of him, Drew is the one who got me to do this. We'll take care of you. I promise. But we need karsten on record saying something we can use. You have to go back in there. Are you crazy? Karsten knows. We're already working on your green card. You need to hold up your end of the deal. What I need is for you to leave me alone. Forget the deal. Tell drew I'm out. Yeah, our kid got to her phone And accidentally changed the pass code. Oh, she's busy. That's why I'm calling. No, we don't want to reset the whole phone. Look, my name's on the account, too, so what's the problem? Fine. I get it. No, you've been very helpful. Jackass. It's a good place to think... Among other things. Found this on the shelf... One of my favorites. Except it's, uh... it's fake, Like the tv, the stove, everything. Did you want him to find out? Was that the idea? What are you talking about? I thought I deleted it. You thought? Did he see it? No, but how could you do that? I only get you for a few hours at a time. I just wanted something to keep. We have to be more careful. You can't just do something like that without... I know. I'm sorry. It just felt like some part of you wants to get caught. You know, maybe some part of me does. I... just so we can stop lying and sneaking around. 'cause it may not bother you, but it sure as hell bothers me. Of course it bothers me! Well, then why keep doing it? You mean hiding it? No, any of it. I mean, what's the end game? Would you ever leave your husband? Would you ever leave elaine? I met her, you know... At the restaurant. What? She's lovely. She's charming. She's very friendly. She's smart. What did you say to her? Nothing. We had a drink. She had no idea who I was. Why the hell would you do that? Because I wanted to know about her, Because I want to know about you. Of... of being careless for taking a picture, And you sat down and you had drinks with my wife?! Do you love her? Come on, sara. Do you? I've been with her for 20 years. You know, she... She gets my jokes. She knows every reference. She knows everything about me. Almost. Yeah. Almost. I love her. You know, it's not the same as it once was, but still. And I love drew. So what are we doing here? Elaine: You know, you realize you could have asked Yes. I could have done that, but, you know, it's complicated. Yeah. You don't seem complicated. Ouch. I just mean you... you seem remarkably free of baggage. Oh, I don't know. I've got my problems. Mm-hmm. Like what? Like wanting what I can't have. Elaine. Hey. What are you doing here? Uh, meeting ended early. You want to grab a coffee? I would love to, but, uh, I have this corporate luncheon at 11:00. It's gonna be a full house. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Aidan: Did you need anything else? We're good. Thanks. Uh, sorry. Jack, this is, uh... Aidan. The wine guy. Actually, would you mind Bringing in the box of pinot, please? Sure. Nice guy. What's going on? Uh, nothing. I told you. Jack, you are not yourself. What's wrong? I got to go. Jack, talk to me. It's me. About what? I told you. I'm fine. All right? So, you told your husband about me? Yeah, I told him you were overcharging me for merlot. But you don't know for sure. Do I have proof? No. But isn't it obvious? She's nothing but trouble, jack, And you should have been on top of it. Well, forgive me for not being psychic. You don't need to be psychic to see we're being played. You used to be better than this. Now, are you gonna handle this thing Or do I need to bring in someone who can? Oh, by "someone," you mean zarek? Yeah. He's effective. I'll straighten out brandy, but we still need her, okay? She's the only alibi t.J.'s got. Okay. But if she's working for the feds, jack... She's not an alibi. She's a problem. But I don't understand. Where... where are you going? To visit friends. But for how long? I don't know. You kissed me. You said that we don't kiss, but then you did. You kissed me. I-I did it because I didn't want us to get in trouble. In trouble for what? What's going on? Yeah, that's what I've been wondering. T.J., you mind? Brandy and I need to talk. No, I'm done talking. Oh, really? To us? Or to the feds? You think they don't know? You think anyone believes t.J. Was with me? Well, but they do believe it. They... they let me go. I-I don't mean to scare you, but I can't help you anymore. The best thing would be for me to take amy And go where no one will ever find us. You are not leaving. Do you understand? You will shut the hell up and stay here Until t.J.'s trial, just like we agreed. Stop telling me what to do. You made a promise, and if you break it... Then what? What are you gonna do? Kill me? Just get out. Get out! Let her go. All right. Calm down. I said let her go! You stop scaring her! T.J., she's not what you think. Yes, she is. You don't understand. Stop talking! You always talk down to me! You bully people, you use them, you hurt them, Because that's your job! Relax, okay? Ever since we were kids, you wanted to hurt me. That's not true. Yes, it is, and you know it. You let me drive that night! You didn't stop me! You wanted it to happen! You wanted to hurt me! You had nothing... No parents, no money! We took you in. We made you one of us. We made you part of the family, and you hated us for it. You took it out on me. Every time I see you, I know. Hello? Hi. You haven't seen my phone, have you? Nope. Sorry. I don't know what I did with it. Anyway, how's your day? Good. How about you? Any plans? No, just a meeting this afternoon. At the office? No, just over coffee. All right, I'll keep looking. Love you. Love you, too. What if he comes back? Or... or if your father sends someone else? Then I'll be right here. I-I-I won't let anything happen to you. Oh, you don't know how much trouble I'm in. Well, I don't think anyone could be in more trouble than me. Listen, you heard jack. Uh, if you stay here, it'll be okay. That's all they want. It's not that simple. I made mistakes. But if they want to, they can find you wherever you go. Here, I can help you. If you leave, I can't. Stay here. Let me help you. I want to help. Sara: Jack? Jack? So, nothing happened? No. You don't think that jack seems off? He's got a lot of things on his mind. A lot on his mind? No, he's a wreck. Well, he certainly isn't at the top of his game. I thought it might be something at home. And I thought it was something at work. Ah. Because ever since t.J.'s arrest, He's been preoccupied and distant. Maybe this is all too much pressure for him. Jack insisted on handling it himself. But maybe defending your own brother-in-law Is not the best legal strategy. I suggested bringing in another lawyer, But he didn't want anyone else representing t.J. You know their history. I imagine jack still feels responsible for what happened. The accident was a long time ago, dad. Jack never talks about it. Elaine, the things men never talk about Are the things that drive them crazy. We grew up together. We did everything together. T.J. Knew all the bands. I mean, he could talk our way into any club, any bar. Me... I was quiet, you know, the wingman. But he was the prince of the north side. You know, everyone knew him or wanted to be him. And he had this unbelievably tricked-out camaro. He loved that car. One night, we got wasted after a show at the metro. We were driving home. We cut through the skokie lagoons, no lights... Just pushing the car faster and faster. We took a curve too fast, and the car... It plunged into the water. I mean it... It hit like a shock. The water started pouring in everywhere. And I'm screaming, you know, "t.J., we got to get out," But he's not moving, And the water's closing up over us. I can't see. I can't breathe. And t.J.'s strapped in, and m-my fingers aren't working. And I start to black out. So, I leave him, And I swim up and grab some air and dive back down. But it's too late. You know, he... he was under For way too long without any air. And he's still alive, but he's... Afterwards, everybody's thanking me. You know, saying I saved him. But I was driving. I just wanted to drive that car so bad. I-I took the keys from him. I never told anyone. Not even him. Maybe I-I waited a second too long. You know, maybe I could have got him out sooner. Look what I did to him. Look what I took away. Give me your clothes. I'll wash them. Thanks. It's sweet of you to want to get cleaned up for amy. She'll be happy to see you. I'm glad you're staying. Well, I just said I would think about it. I'm still glad. Why? Why do you care so much? What? Nothing. I just... Um... Brandy? What? I-I thought this wasn't gonna happen. Yeah. It won't. I'm sorry about the photo. It's okay. I mean, you were right. I do have this secret hope that, somehow, Something will happen, and everything will change. What would you want to do... Want to be... If you weren't working for thatcher karsten? I don't know. Sometimes, I feel like I'm in this... Cage. The crazy part is every single bar I put there... You know, who I am, what I do. You know, it was my choice every step of the way. Well, here's the thing. You put the bars up. You can take them down. Excuse me? Woman: All impeccably furnished With cook's kitchens and breathtaking views. Stop by, and one of our representatives Would be happy to show you a model apartment Just like the one that could be yours. The montague... Where your future awaits. Now, what did you say your name was again? Bob. Bob drew. And are you new to chicago? Just moved from new york. Oh, I've never been. Yeah, I keep telling my husband. Stupid silly. I brought the wrong master key. I'll just be a minute. We offer a choice of viking or sub-zero And, of course, a walk-in pantry. You do like to cook? No. Ah, here we are. Here we go. Et voilà. No. No, no, no. This is all wrong. You don't like it? This is north. I need west. I told you facing the wrigley building. Well, they're all nice views. The apartment on the tv... Where is it? Uh, that's penthouse 15, but we're not showing it. Sir. Sir! Orestes, what's up? Let me call you back. It's about t.J. I have to go. Thank you. You're a good man, jack mcallister. You may not know it, but I do. Sorry I'm late. Oh. My interview went long. Did you get my text? No, but it's okay. So, what's this article about? She just said you were doing this major feature and we had to meet. "25 chicagoans on the verge." All under 40, all up-and-comers. New blood... Not the same old faces. And I was thinking simple black-and-whites, But you're the expert. Is the list set, or is there still room? Why? You got someone in mind? Jack: Up till now, the story's been That t.J. Karsten killed lou mrozek, But that's all it is... a story. You want to hear mine? Darius miller, known as lil' d, Is on the street looking for a target. He finds one... lou mrozek. Lil' d takes out his knife, approaches. But lou's been uneasy lately... Paranoid. He's packing a gun. There's a struggle. Lil' d gets ahold of the gun And shoots lou twice, killing him. And then he runs and the murder weapon disappears. Until now. Word travels fast. I know the weapon's been found covered with lil' d's prints But not t.J. Karsten's. Not this office's finest hour. Agreed. Right. Then you understand what I'm getting at. Look, drew stafford's been pursuing a personal vendetta Against the karsten family since day one, And when this new evidence is disclosed, His case against t.J.... His story... is done. And it'll be all over the media That your department prosecuted an innocent man. Now, is that the first mark you want to make as director? He led a major corruption probe Into the chicago police department. He just successfully prosecuted bribery charges For the councilman fielding case. He's a crusader, but he's still pretty unknown, And he's your husband. I-I know, but I am telling you, He's a really good subject for this article. The guy is gonna be senator or governor someday. He never stops working. Okay, great. Drew, what are you doing here? Met an alderman for drinks. You? Oh, just the man we were talking about. I'm greg. Greg's gonna include you In an article of rising local stars. Sara's been pretty persuasive. He's gonna feature you in the magazine. Uh, that's... Great. Thanks. I got to go. Okay. Meeting my husband for dinner. We'll discuss the photos back at the office. Sounds good. Bye. Bye. Bye. What's going on? I just... I think I'm going crazy. I mean... I got it off your camera. Why didn't you say something? Just answer me. Are you having an affair? No. No. This is a test shot. Of what? For this... Series of self-portraits That I've been thinking about. It's, like, uh, staged scenes, like cindy sherman. I took it a few days ago at this apartment That the magazine used for shoots. This reflection... who's that? That's billy, one of the interns. I know. I'm no cindy sherman, right? Maybe I am going crazy. No, it's totally understandable. I... just next time you think something, just ask, okay? Don't dwell on it. You're right. Yeah. You're right. What's that? Oh, um... Ollie had a... Bloody nose this morning. Oh. All right, well, I've got to get back to the office, But I'll see you later. All right? See you at home. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. What? Sorry, I've been home sick. Why? Confirmation for a hearing? I don't have a hearing scheduled for today. Judge: Last on the docket... People vs. Thatcher karsten jr. Is everyone present? Yes, your honor. Yes, your honor. The state has made a motion to dismiss the case. Is that correct? That's right, your honor. What the hell is going on? Why is goss here? I believe he's your new boss. And is there any objection? No, your honor. The defense has no objection. Then, on the state's motion, and without objection, The matter of the people vs. Thatcher karsten jr. Is hereby dismissed. He did it. Hey. Great, huh? I don't know what to say. It's okay. Uh, I'm sorry for all the things I said. I was... I was way out of line. It's something we should have talked about a long time ago. Well done, jack. Hey. You did it. It's over. I told you it'd be okay. Congratulations. Okay, well, get back soon, because we're celebrating. Right? Everyone, to the restaurant. Yeah, I'll call brandy. I say we leave her alone. She's learned her lesson. The story's got a happy ending. Let's leave it at that. What about the feds? She doesn't know anything about our operation. She's no threat. You did good, jack. Now that it's over, we can get back to business. We've got a meeting with westlake capital And lunch at the builders association. You coming, dad? Yeah. Jack? Are you all right? What's going on? I quit. What? What did you say? I quit, thatcher. I-I-I quit. You... you mean the case? The case is over, jack. I'm not working for you anymore. I'm sorry. I'm done. What did he mean, dad? Is jack not working for you anymore? It sounded like he said he quit. Nobody quits. You pulled a fast one, didn't you? Karsten way. The evidence speaks for itself, Whether you choose to believe it or not. He's right. Let it go. Evidence my ass. You did something, and when I find out... You'll what? You'll come after me? There's nothing to find out. Listen to your colleague. It's over. Let's just put this behind us, hmm? You hurt your hand. Reporter: Mr. Mcallister? Mr. Mcallister, a statement? Is it true new evidence surfaced, Exonerating t.J. Karsten? Howard goss and the state's attorney's department Have acted with admirable tact and speed. Come on. We don't need to see this. That's all. Thank you very much. Synced & corrected by * Rambo Media Ltd *
