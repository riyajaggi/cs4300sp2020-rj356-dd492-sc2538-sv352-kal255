 I have a 1962 impala. It's all original. Previously on "betrayal"... T.J. Was with me that night. How much is thatcher karsten paying you to say that? Thatcher: It's not over, not by a long shot. They brought the battle to us, so this is war. Unh! I want to be a full member of the team. That's between you and thatcher. It's more complicated now. Don't threaten me.

 I'll take it. It's a lot of space for one person. It is just you, right? Yes. I'm a lone wolf. Free. Unencumbered. Very greedy. Hmm. I'm not sure you're the right buyer for this. Oh, well, I flew all the way here from lisbon. Oh, I'm sorry that you went to so much trouble. Are you, uh, Are you sure there's nothing I can do... To change your mind?

 Like what? I'm sorry, But what do you think you're doing? Miss, this is highly inappropriate. I just really... Want... This apartment. ♪ Jack mcallister... Leave a message. Hot wine guy is here for the tasting. Uh, have him come back tomorrow when paulette's in. He wants you. He always wants you. He knows you're married. What's the harm? Part of being married is knowing When not to put yourself in certain situations. Jack mcallister... Leave a message. Hey, uh, the father of some kid in vic's class called for you. Maybe it's a dad's-night-out thing. I know how you love those. Um, all right. Talk later. Aidan! You know, I-I actually do have a few minutes now. Announcer: Using the latest in sustainable design, Karsten allied will build a mixed-use enterprise... Including hotels, retail space... And the city council. 4,500 residential units... So I got us a shipment of solar panels out of china. China? Mm-hmm. No, no, no. Let's wait on that. Look, if we can get some more out of our u.S. Suppliers... Look, thatcher. I'm working on it with a customs official. We're not going through customs. So, what, we smuggle them in? 10,000 panels are arriving tonight. I want you to be there to receive them. That is not part of my job description. Well, your job description is changing. Need some help with that, jack? No, I don't think that will be necessary. Oh, look at him... Such a stand-up guy, everything above board. On second thought, maybe you should come. Good. The panels should be there around 10:00. You'll need to break the seal. Once you've checked out the sample, I want you to get those trucks In and out of there as fast as you can. Tariff evasion, Trade exploitation, commercial fraud. Here we go. Alissa: Sara. Janet, hi. My name's sara hanley. I'm so pleased to meet you. Sara's shooting the photos For the boyd piece. I'm really looking forward to working with you. I loved your series on the revolution in egypt. I think it was in newsweek. It was... it was so powerful. Two years ago, I was covering rebels in tahrir square. Now I'm doing a profile of a local c.E.O. For a local magazine. Uh, well, you know, Boyd's actually more complicated than I expected. Could be good for the story, so... I'm heading over there now if you want to share a cab. That's okay. I have a car. She is talented but requires special handling. All right, then. I'll handle her. I like it, but what's with you? You're so agreeable lately. I don't know. New shampoo? Really? Mm. See you later. Mm-hmm. The wine guy's got a crush on me. The wine guy? His name's aidan. He's 29. Hmm. Really? Aidan? Is that a man's name? Is it so hard to believe? What, a crush on you? Of course not. Thanks for telling me, I guess. Well, wouldn't you tell me If some hot, young thing had a crush on you? So he's hot and young. Mm-hmm. And he's got good taste. Impeccable. He's a wine guy. Hmm. I got to go to work. Uh, don't wait up. It's a bunch of sun panels, not heroin, not c-4. What's the big deal? Trade rules are complicated. It shouldn't be illegal, but it is. It's all good. I'll get my trucks in. Does it make you sleep better at night Thinking this shouldn't be illegal? Drive in. We're good to go. Doesn't have the stomach for his job anymore. Well, at least I still have the brains for it. Hey, henry. Hey. How's your little girl? Better. She's in rehab now. Thanks for your help with the cops. You doing okay? It's a bad night, jack. You under the weather? Real bad night. You should go home. We have to turn the trucks around. Turn around! Out of here, out of here! Where are they going? If they don't move the contraband, we've got nothing. How did they know? But we have to stay within the lines And make sure nothing could be used against us. We have a rat, jack. Someone inside this company has turned on us. Drew: They're guilty. It's obvious. Sneaking around in the middle of the night, Covering their tracks. A fleet of trucks drove in and out, empty. That's enough for a warrant, your honor. There was a time no one had the balls to cross me. This is the time to strike. We have to stay a step ahead. We have to catch them now. This whole thing's about to blow up. We've got nothing. They destroyed it all. I love you. Anything missing? Oh, yeah. The bulb from the lid. Other than that? Anything wrong with this picture? Yeah, I replaced the cardboards For a 1960, not '62. Keen eye. You're good to go. Hey, y-you don't need any extra help around here, do you? I can pull engines out and... and take off hoods. Seriously? Know a hell more about cars than you do. I'm happy to clean tires. I know how to use that gel to make them look new. I guess we could try it out. Oh, that'd be great. Thanks. Thanks. I've hired a new security team We'll have them start in thatcher's office... Man: Mcallister, jack mcallister. Is he in? Sir, if you don't have an appointment... Uh, w-what's the trouble? Mr. Mcallister, do you know this man? You vic's dad? Yeah. Who are you? Vic attacked my son with a baseball bat. What? Woman: We need security on... ricky's in the hospital! Look, I know they had a fight, but he... After that! Your kid hit him with a bat And left him bleeding on the sidewalk! Yeah, look, I don't know what you're talking about, all right? Hey! And I'm not letting you off the hook! Wow. You screwing his wife, too? Shut up. Janet: Hey. I got some really interesting stuff today. And I got a call from the company's publicist. I hear you're taking up a lot of their time. Well, boyd's a difficult guy. There are a lot of angles here, like his ex-c.T.O. Well, she sued him for hostile work environment And won. Her story's pretty intense. This is your first cover, isn't it? I'll leave my prints on your desk. I think you might find them useful. Let's see. My story will be in the magazine queue By the end of the day. Read it. After we broke up, I moved here, but she kept the ring, Which would have come in handy For first and last month's rent. Oh. Yeah, that's rough. How long were you together? Six months. Six months? What, then it wasn't meant to be? Still be in the honeymoon phase at that point. You know, you... you want to be together all the time. You can't keep your hands off each other. And after the honeymoon phase? The mystery turns into security. And you have kids, and then you just stop... Needing so much. Wow. Marriage sounds awesome. Oh, sorry. This is about my son. Teenage boys... That's another awesome thing. Look, we need to monitor everyone coming in and out. More cameras... Access control points. Why is that beeping? Well, the computer and phone may be setting it off. We'll remove them after we've finished the general scan And sweep the area again. Hey, can we talk? Hi. Uh, I'm sorry. Could you excuse us, please? Oh. No problem. Be here all week. Well, after I, uh, got your text, I talked to vic, And he says he didn't do it. You believe him? I want to believe him. I-I mean, I do, but, uh... He's been boxing. Did you know that? No. With my father? No, I didn't. I just feel like we're living in separate worlds. We have no idea what's going on with each other. Well, you know, they're teenagers. I mean, this is what happens. Not just them. Us, too. You and me. You forgot the sprinklers. The tomatoes are dried up. The turnips are dead. Well, I never really liked turnips anyway. I'm sorry. Uh, I've been distracted... You know, t.J.'s case. This a.S.A. Guy's all over us. Are we okay? Look, I-I'm stuck here late with security, but... How about we, uh, go out tomorrow night together? Does that sound good? Yeah. I would like that. I'll talk to vic. She ignored everything I gave her. I mean, her article could have been written Guess I shouldn't be so surprised. I mean, photographers can see things That reporters don't. Why? We just get at stuff from a different angle. Careful, buddy. Go wash your hands. Hey, do you think it's okay That ollie eats mac and cheese every day? I mean, joelle's turned her whole family vegan. Grows their own veggies in the backyard. It's a thing now. Mcallister's wife does turnips and tomatoes. Oliver, dinner's ready! I love this picture. Remember? You could get him to stop crying by handing him a balloon. We need to go at this from a different angle. Our warrant expires in 24 hours. We've been trying to get karsten on the big stuff, The hard stuff... Racketeering, corruption. Instead, we need to go after something easier, More attainable. Like what? Witness tampering. We get the hooker to go to karsten wearing a wire. She gets him to admit he paid her to be t.J.'s alibi. That's asking a lot. She already planted a bug for us. And it's too dangerous. We can't train her in 24 hours. We need to get you one big victory to ride out on. The party tonight's more than enough. Look, this girl has spent her entire life Pretending she thinks and feels things she doesn't. She can do this. She's great at lying. Business, where are we with the michael boyd article? Cover line... "chicago's best c.E.O.: Mr. Cool." Photos? Uh, fine. I'm still working on them. Column on why the national media loves to beat up on chicago. Wow. That old chestnut. Alissa, could the three of us talk after? Is there a problem? No. I'll tell you later. Tell me now. That's what this meeting is for. That the photos and the story match up. Dear god. You're like a little wind-up toy that won't stop. What's the problem? Okay. This is boyd accepting the award For most eco-friendly c.E.O. In chicago. And this is the hummer that he keeps at his lake house. We're all hypocrites. So? This is boyd screaming at his head of h.R. Alissa, this is ridiculous. The woman in accounting he fired After she refused to go out with him. Boyd's not the best anything in chicago. He's just a phony jerk who made a lot of money. For his company and his shareholders... So he's talented. Which is how we judge c.E.O. Performance! Does that mean he gets away with whatever he wants?! It's not our job to protect his image, And I would have thought you of all people Would agree with that. I'm gonna need a different photographer. Who was that in there? But weren't you a little bit glad I said what I said? But what came over you? I thought I was doing my job. Janet's writing a total puff piece. And we run those sometimes. Does boyd's company buy a lot of ads or something? Look, sara, we can't use these pictures, okay? But they are fantastic, So I'm gonna call my friend at the new york times And see if they want to order up reporting. Are you serious?! Thank you! This new sara, this... This whole transformation, It's because of him, isn't it? It's not just that. It's not a fling. Then what is it? I told him I loved him. Damn. You are in trouble. Unh! Agh! What the hell? I'm in the middle of a game. Ricky's father came to see me. Yeah, I know. Mom said. Did you do it? I mean, ricky's got like a million enemies. You better not be lying to me. Why? 'cause you never lie? I mean, you're never home. It's like you don't even live here anymore. I sleep less, but I have more energy. Colors are brighter. Everything is clearer. It's like... I can finally see, And I don't ever remember feeling this way. Not even with drew? With drew, it was different. It was... It was never like this. What's the deal with his marriage? I mean, does he ever talk about his wife? Well, it's like we've been living in a... A bubble. There are a lot of things we don't talk about. T.J. I thought you were coming back to the office. No, dad, I... I work here now. I told you. T.J., get in the car. But I'm in the middle of my job. This isn't a job. Yes, it is! I'm fixing a broken spring. Why do you think they want you here? Because I know about this stuff, and I'm good at it. No, because you come from money. That's what they want. They're just using you. Y-yeah, to replace a front suspension. It doesn't make any sense! Look, son, I-I just don't want to see you get hurt. That's all. Now, come on. No, I-I-I have to align it after I repair it. T.J., use your head. Of all the people in chicago who can fix a car, Why do you think they would hire you?! Get in the car. We don't know enough about each other? Jack: Mm, no, I think I've done a pretty thorough, Head-to-toe examination of... You know what I mean. You have a whole life, a home. I want to hear about it. I can't always pretend I'm a nymphomaniac from lisbon. Okay. What do you want to know? Your daughter. What's she into? Uh, folk music with lots of shouting. Well, she sounds cool. And your son? Oh, vic... he's going through a bit of a rough time. Uh, we're working through it. Teenagers. And elaine? You want to talk about elaine? Yeah, I do. Um... Okay, well, she's She's strong, smart. Um, she's a great mother. Um... She has a-a restaurant That she's doing really well with. She, uh, she gardens, right? Turnips and tomatoes? How did you know that? Uh, drew. He was talking about the case. Why was drew talking about my wife? I don't know. Um... I shouldn't have said anything. No. I don't think I like this game. I don't want him going back to that garage. I'm on it. Jack, that little snafu with the solar panels Is costing me $20,000 a day. Got any ideas? Go to that prosecutor, raid his house. Right, jack? There you go. Problem solved. Number seven with the pigtails. She's yours, right? Amy? What are you doing here? I love soccer. Man: Go, go, go, go! I already did you a favor. This will be the last time I ask. They will kill me. We can protect you. We can ensure your safety. No. I'm done. Look. If you help us with this, We can put karsten away for good, And he won't ever be able to hurt you. Men like you. You want what you want, like my clients, Only they don't pretend to be anything. But you... You pretend to be good. I'll take an honest thief any day. Happy anniversary, you two. Dmitri, table 24 is ready for dessert, But you need to crumb that table first, please. Oh, romy, that reminds me, I packed that chocolate cake for your mom's birthday. And now your present's better than mine. Oh, excuse me. Would you mind giving that a try? It's not on the menu yet. Uh, sure. I-I don't mind. Thanks, but promise me you'll be honest. It's delicious. You don't like it. No, it's good. Now, you don't have to lie just to be nice. Isn't it crazy how women always do that? Yeah, it really is. I wonder if maybe it needs a little cilantro. Honestly, I have no idea. I can't cook. My son eats mac and cheese Out of the box every night, so... Well, you know that cooking is just About practice and familiarity. My mother spent her life in the kitchen, So if I wanted to talk to her, that's where I had to go. Well, my mother was a perfectionist. She hated mess, so the kitchen was off-limits. You know what, though? I made nutritious meals for my kids And I really don't think it made much of a difference at all. Hi. You're back soon. Yeah, well, you know, I had to bring you This '09 syrah from napa. Okay. I heard it has a smooth finish. Yeah, and nice legs. Maybe we should give it a taste. Okay. Oh, I'm elaine, by the way. I own the place. Oh. Sara. You look familiar. Have we met? No, I don't think so. Well, it's nice to meet you now. Yeah, you too. Bye. Bye. Hey, listen, if you get that whole-wheat mac and cheese And you throw in egg whites and carrot puree, Voilà, healthy meal. Kind of. Thank you. Okay. Drew: Snack mom. It's a thankless job. Kids... they want candy. Parents want fruit. Get away from my car. Yeah, I used to play t-ball here... Well, back when it was a field, not a parking lot. Let me get that for you. I grew up over in humboldt park. I used to spend my summers Reading all day at the pulaski library, Then I'd go over to nebbie's where my mom worked To help her serve red-hots. You seem like a gold coast kid. Nope. Single mom, four kids. She struggled, but she was tough. Like you. We go to nebbie's all the time. Mm. Konstantine is still there. Good, old konstantine. You knew him? Yeah, of course. 'cause there is no konstantine there. Not only are you a liar, you're not even good at it. The thing about my family, that's all true. What's wrong with you? Look. There is one thing that I care about, One thing I need, and time is running out. Well, I can't help you! Why not? Why are you gonna let karsten use you like this? What, I should be your pawn instead of his? You got to have dreams, right? Something you aspire to. Haven't you ever wanted anything that badly? Yeah, I want things. A place in a good school district, My record cleaned, a green card. No questions asked. You make me an american, I'll be whatever you want. Whoo! You did such a good job. Yes, and you were running so fast. No, but alissa's sending them to the new york times. Wow. That would be a step up. Standing up to janet like that could have been a disaster, But it felt kind of good. Might even work out better in the end. What do you think of this tie? You look pretty, mommy. Where are you going? My boss' retirement party. Oliver, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?! Here it comes! I'm not done! Larry, you are totally irreplaceable. That being said, I am on the list of people to replace you, right? How close to the top of that list am I? Closer than you were yesterday. You got brandy korskaya to thank for that. She's gonna drive this thing home. Hope you're right. I know I'm right 'cause I'm gonna put her in training first. That's a change. Uh, she's not as ready as I thought, and... She's got this little kid. No reason to pull the trigger tonight. There he is... The last good man! Congratulations, larry. I hear you're taking your wife to rio. 10-day cruise. Good for you.
