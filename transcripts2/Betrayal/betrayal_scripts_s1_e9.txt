 You either work for me or you don't, And right now, you don't. It's good to see you here, son. Welcome back to work. I-I was thinking I-I could help with the new streeterville proposal. Well, that's okay, son. I've already put someone on it. Well, I could check the breakdown. I'm good with numbers, you know. That's what I have accountants for. I want to help, dad. I-I know it's hard with jack gone. T.J., we're fine. Everything's been taken care of.

 Pop? What?! Jack's gonna come back real soon, isn't he, When he gets over all this? T.J., I have a meeting right now. Can we talk about it over lunch? Jack: Jack mcallister. Leave a message. Jack, I keep getting your damn voicemail. I'd really appreciate it if you'd call me back. I miss you, son. Remember to bring your cleats to school. You've got practice today. I'm gonna play goalie, block a goal with my head. Well, make sure it's your head and not your face. Breakfast time! Dad! Somebody order ham and pineapple? Oh, awesome! For breakfast? Really? It's our new thing. Ollie and I found a 24-hour place down the street. We also watch classic sports while we eat it. Okay, well, oliver's got a birthday party on Saturday. Invite's on the fridge. You'll need to get a present. Got it. Laundry's done. I changed the linens on the bed. You didn't have to do that. Oh, I almost forgot. Open it later. Okay. Bye, lovebug. I'll see you in a few days. Bye, mommy. Dad, the blackhawks just scored! What?! Ah, missed it. Let's watch it again. ♪ Hello? Mr. Mcallister, this is quincy theringer from the fbi. You've been ducking my calls. What do you want? Your help. That's all. We're circling the wagons around the karsten family. Well, actually, uh, my situation has changed, so... You quit karsten allied. We know. And that is exactly why you and I need to have a sit-down Before this gets messy. Listen... I can't help you. We're not targeting you, jack. Not yet. Don't make us come after you, okay? Elaine: Hey. Hey. Where are the bowls? In the kitchen. Oh. I did not see them. I'm making eggs. You like eggs, right? Sure. Well, go ahead and rest. I'll... I'll let you know when they're ready. Okay, but it's not really fair because you're a pro, And I'm a rank amateur. Well, at cooking, maybe, but not at everything. You know, I was thinking... We've never actually been on a real date. What do you say, tonight? Or are you ashamed of being seen in public with me? Well, you could wear a bag over your head. Yeah. Yeah, I'll do that. Okay. All right. Brunch in 10 minutes. Okay. Okay. ♪ Have you had some revelations? ♪ ♪ Been hoping that you'd find it ♪ Hey. Hey. I have a great idea. Mm. I got them today. Got what? It's a shock seeing it in writing. I can imagine. Hey. ♪ Oh, oh, ah Let's take off, get out of town, and clear our heads. And go where? Anywhere. It doesn't matter. My car is out front. Let's just go and do something spontaneous, Have an adventure. Jack, I can't. You can, and you need to. You have three days before you're back on oliver time. Call the magazine, Move meetings, postpone assignments, whatever it takes. Let's just leave everything behind. What do you say? I'll go get my toothbrush. Mm! How are you doing? Okay. I may not have said this before, But I'm... I'm really glad you're back. I think I know why jack can't give up this girl. He's in love with her. Like me and brandy. Okay. Don't forget to take your medication. What do you think happens to you when you die? Do you go somewhere, o-or do you just disappear? Everybody's got their own opinion about that. What do you believe in? I believe in... Nothing. After you die, they cremate you, Or they put you in a hole in the ground, And that's all there is. No soul, no afterlife, no reincarnation. So brandy's just nowhere now? And mom? T-they're not in pain. They're not suffering. They're just... Gone. I don't think that's right. I think brandy's in a better place. Mom, too. That's what I believe. Maybe you're right. Don't forget your meds. I'd squeeze between my parents in the front of my dad's pickup. And whenever we crossed a state line, I'd make a wish and he'd let me honk the horn. But I thought that if I honked the horn at the exact moment When the front wheel was in one state And the back wheel was in another, The wish would come true. You don't talk about your parents much. Well, they've been dead a long time. And when the karsten family adopted you, Did they give you any kind of help, someone to talk to? No. Why did they do it, adopt you? Well, dad was a construction foreman At karsten allied for 17 years. Thatcher came to trust him, rely on him. I think maybe he felt That he owed it to my father to take me in. Look. Make a wish. Val: She's a photographer for wicker park magazine. Oh, look. Her photo essay on chicago's best burger, You have absolutely no interest in bonding with my dog, do you? Mushroom hunters. Fascinating. If you and I are gonna get serious about this, you got to Get serious about george, okay? He's part of the deal. Cabbage roses and baby strollers. Oh, my god. My grandfather. Ooh! The plot thickens. Do you think that's how she met your dad? I don't know. I don't care. I left my keys at your house. I got to run back. Can you please stay and try to bond with my dog? Hey, stranger. Been a while. I'm not used to seeing you in the light of day. Delphine, val. Val, delphine. Hi, george! How you doing?! I missed you! Del, I got to run. Take care, okay? Yeah, yeah. You guys are together? Yeah. Watch out. She's a wild ride. As soon as she's got you, she's bored. Broke a lot of hearts in my crowd. Why are you telling me this? Sorry. None of my business. Shouldn't have said anything. Nice meeting you. Bring. Do you guys need any help? Yes! It looks like a broken fuel line. Great... I knew we should have Had the car checked out before the wedding. You're getting married? No. No, not us. Uh, my college roommate, helen, Is marrying tom's climbing partner. We introduced them, and I'm in the ceremony. Tom's giving a toast. And if we miss it... I'm going to kill you. Where's the wedding? Tom: About 90 miles away. They rented some old house in the middle of frigging nowhere. We'll take you. No. We couldn't ask you to do that. No, seriously. We have nowhere to be. Oh, my god. Thank you so much! See? Karma at work. Thank you. Aidan: Hello. Hi. I'm jules. Aidan. I was just cleaning up. Okay. Have fun with that. I'm just looking for my keys. Oh, you're val's friend, right? You got it. You work at karsten allied? Uh, yes. What do you do there? I.T. I'm a pisces, I grew up in tampa, And I like long walks in the park. Sorry. I don't mean to be nosy. So, who are you? I am a friend of elaine's. Friend, huh? Got it. Oh. Here they are. I got to get going. Nice meeting you. Yeah. You know, the truth is, we're both down on this wedding. Why? Eh, they're 22. You know, who gets married at 22? I did. I was 23. It was different back then. Hey. Easy, now. For relationships to last 3 to 5 years. How long have you two been together? 3 1/2 years. So our days are numbered, really. Stop, tom. The long-term thing is clearly working for these two. Eh, we're doing all right. How are you supposed to know That the person you want to be with now Is the person you're going to want to be with in 20 years? I guess, ultimately you don't. You don't? No. It's a leap of faith. Well, it's not about faith. It's about our dna. I mean, when you start out, there's this surge of magic. But all that's just an evolutionary trick To make people have babies. I really hope this isn't your wedding toast. We need city hall to... I don't care about excuses, byron. Mr. Karsten, what I'm trying to say is... You didn't tell me you'd be in here. T.J., this is a meeting about streeterville. It doesn't concern you. It smells like fish in here. Laura, would you mind? I'm not under the hood. Now, about those permits. I will head down to... Someone call 911! No. Get groves. He's in the system. But mr. Karsten, he needs an ambulance! I know what I'm doing. It's a seizure. Just call groves now! I'd like to bring him in for some tests. Why? So you can tell me something I already know? You used to treat his seizures at home. But he hasn't had one in almost two years. Like I told you, he went off his meds. I'd like to check his drug levels, run an e.E.G., Properly assess the situation. Isn't that what you're doing? He's postictal. I won't be able to evaluate his neurological status for hours. Well, then make yourself comfortable. Wow! Nothing like my wedding. Let me guess. Formal hotel-ballroom sort of thing? 300 guests. Hey. So, I talked to our friends, and it's settled. You're staying for the wedding. Oh, no, we couldn't. You have to. You're the heroes of the night. It's gonna start any minute. Well, it is pretty here. Excellent. Oh, and also, there's this. Everyone had one at cocktail hour. It makes everything... Way more fun. Might as well go with it. Drew: Take. Oliver: T-a-k-e. Drive. D-r-I-v. Nope, told you before, got to add an "e" at the end. Well, how am I supposed to remember? You just have to memorize it. Well, that's not what mom does. She draws a picture. A picture of what? Like for "drive," she would draw a car With an "e" on the side so I don't forget the "e." Well, I'm not much of an artist. Then how am I supposed to remember? You just have to write it down a bunch of times. I don't want to. Oliver. I don't care if I get it wrong. Yes, you do. I know things are hard sometimes, And you're not always gonna get everything right in life. But it is really, really important to never give up, To never stop trying. How's that? Weird. Is that even a car? Yeah. It's an impala. Hmm. Oh, this was fun. "was"? Well, it's not over yet. Not even close to over. Oh! Oh, well, I just haven't been on a real date In a very long time. Well, you're gonna get used to it. Hey. Can I ask you something? Why are you still wearing your wedding ring? Um... I don't know. I... I mean, I've had it on for so long, it's... It's like a part of my hand now. I don't think that's it. Oh, you don't? Well, by all means, explain it to me. Okay, I think that you are single For the first time in 20 years, and it scares you. Yeah. Yeah, well, it definitely does. Well, I hope it's not me that you're afraid of. Should I be? No, of course not. Good. Look, elaine, there's something I... Oh, wait! Wait! Ahh! Oh! Quick, make a wish. Okay. Good? Mm-hmm. So, what did you wish for? I... Wished that life was less complicated. Tea and coffee are on the porch! Sara: I don't know any these people, But I think I love them, all of them. Do you know your eyes are blue, but they're also green And then there's this rim that's kind of orange? I was handed divorce papers today. I should be here thinking all love is doomed. But right now, that couple... That couple believes, And that is a beautiful thing. Oh, I don't believe all love is doomed. That's good. What if it is all just an evolutionary trick? I believe that we are more than our dna. But all we can ever hope for Is that we are where we're meant to be, Which I'm certain of right now. Val: Hey. Jules: Hey. I didn't know you were coming over. Okay. Is this about the dog? Because seriously, I can stop pushing it. Did you used to date that girl that we met at the park today? Babe, jealousy? Seriously? It's a horrible, destructive emotion, And it's a total turnoff. I'm into this. Okay? I promise to be straightforward with you, And I promise not to lie. You can't promise me you won't break my heart. No one can promise that. I'm just... I'm getting this really strong feeling That I need to get out before it's too late. Now who's being the drama queen? Okay, call it what you want. And I just don't think I'm up for the inevitable day When you meet someone else Or I go off to college or this thing just runs its course. So, we're breaking up now to avoid breaking up later? This scares me. And that's the last thing I need right now. I'll go get your jacket from the car. Okay. I'm gonna go and get a massive slice of cake. Hey, jack. Who the hell are you? Quincy theringer, fbi. Got it. Thanks. I'll let you know. His topiramate level was sky-high, But the other meds were undetectable. He probably mixed up his medication by mistake. I'll have a talk with him. Might require more than a talk. It could have been intentional. It's been 22 years, casey. You promised me it wouldn't go on like this. Seizure disorders can be hard to manage. I'm not talking about his seizures. I'm talking about his mind. You said there'd be advances... Stem-cell therapy, neuronal regeneration. I said I had hope for those things. Yeah. So did I. I clung to that hope. He's never getting better. Is he? We have a fancy setup back at my office. I didn't like seeing that jack mcallister blip Headed across state lines. Look... it's only for a few days. Yeah, a little idyll in the woods, while rome is burning. Huh? Good thing is, this is a good place to chat. I'll call you when I get home. Not good enough. We've got an alderman claiming Karsten was running a real-estate-corruption scheme Involving bribery, extortion, and a nail gun, A warehouse worker willing to testify That you smuggled illegal shipments from china. So talk to me now. This whole thing is at a breaking point. I shouldn't be long. Do you want me to come running with you? No, you stay here. I'll be back soon. Okay. Miss hanley. Oh, "sara," please. Ever seen a red-winged blackbird? No. But I have a feeling I'm about to. Hey, you. Hi, mom. Do you remember this, That camping trip we took? Yeah, vic got bit by a snake. I broke up with jules. Why? I don't know. I mean, we get along really well. But she's older, more experienced. And I just don't know if I trust it. How do I know she's not gonna break my heart? You don't. But you never do. Listen, whatever's, uh, going on with me and your dad, I don't want you to ever, Ever think that it's all not worth it. Because it is worth it. Do you understand? Oh, look. It's tabitha. Sara: Wow, what is she? She's a peregrine. She's looking for alonzo. He must be nearby. Alonzo? Her partner. These falcons mate for life. I don't have a lot of time. I'll get to the point then. You need to get over your loyalty to karsten. You need to start helping us. That's not gonna happen. Jack, do you understand... Look, they're family, okay? Without them, I don't know where I'd be. I'll tell you where you wouldn't be... On every page of a federal probe implicating you In a list of crimes and illegal activities a mile long. I'm not gonna turn on him. Then you're gonna sink with him. 'cause we're coming hard, and when we do, You can either be with karsten or with us. Are you ready to go to prison for him? You know where to find me. And I will continue to know where to find you. Did you see something? Um... No. For a second, I thought I did. So, your buddy found that gun, but you don't know where? That's what I said. You having t.J.'s impala parked in your garage, And lil' d happens to get killed Holding the lou mrozek murder weapon. I went to see your brother, omar. Still got another 18 months, right? Yeah, you're good at math. I heard they might have to transfer him. Overcrowding, you know. Here's the thing. There's this swank adult transition facility, crossroads. It's got some great educational programs. Could get a g.E.D., learn some trade. Place is like a damn spa. Sounds good. On the other hand, you know stateville? It's home to the ugliest bunch Of killers and rapists in illinois. I would hate to see omar end up there. Call me. I'll let you know if I hear anything about your brother. Hey. Hey. The gun was in the kid's car. I just got back into town. Is this really so important it couldn't wait? I'm in trouble, quincy. I need out of my cover. Hey, breakfast soon. Oh, great. How you doing? Hey. How far did you go? Oh, not too far. A couple miles. You run the whole way? Yep. I'm not as fast as I used to be. I hear there's gonna be pancakes soon. Is t.J. Karsten in? I'm drew stafford, state's attorney's office. Mr. Stafford? Is there something I can do for you? Yes, I bought him the impala. Well, I have evidence it was parked For an extended period of time At the garage where lil' d worked. I have no idea who that is. Real name, darius miller. He was found dead with the gun used to shoot lou mrozek. Lil' d is the presumed killer. Presumed by some, but not by you, is that it? Now you're catching on. And why is that, mr. Stafford? Because this car being there And lil' d using the mrozek murder weapon, That's just too big of a coincidence. I also have a witness who tells me Lil' d got the gun from your son's car. Why would it have been there? Someone was hiding it... Someone who actually killed lou mrozek. T.J. Again? Or someone who knows him, Someone with access to the impala. This investigation is active. I'm gonna find out who put the gun there. And when I do, someone is going down for murder. Talk to your son. Sara: Why are we stopping here? Jack? Jack? Are you okay? Look. I didn't go running before. I know. Who was she? It's a federal agent, looking into karsten. She wants me to help them. Well, what did you say? That I can't and that I never will. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to get you into it. But I am in it, jack. We're both are. It's hard... To protect you And... and tell you everything at the same time. I never asked to be protected. What I want is to know what's going on, For us to be real with each other. You know, I was thinking about what you said, How to make it last, Not let it just be some evolutionary trick. I was being silly. No, here's how... By being together. Really together, In a way that I never was with elaine And you never were with drew. And whatever comes, whatever challenges, We'll face them together. Well, that's what I want. I hope we can do that. We can. I promise... That I will never shut you out again. And I will never hide anything or have any secrets. Do you believe me? Yes. I do. Look, I'm just back from trying to position mcallister, And he's holding firm. Your lead on his wife might be the only way to flip him. Like who? Jules whitman. She's an I.T. Tech at karsten allied, And she's valerie's girlfriend, karsten's granddaughter. She's got a record. Look. She was convicted last year in seattle For computer hacking with intent to disrupt the I.R.S. She's a radical with a record And unrestricted access at karsten allied. This girl could be a gold mine. What about elaine? I don't think she has much value to us. She doesn't know anything. Something happened. It's an obstacle. What sort of obstacle? A personal relationship. I have feelings for her. Do what you need to do. Your assignment's not changing. Hello? Thatcher: Sara hanley? Mr. Karsten. I'm looking for jack. He's gone to park the car. Fine. I'll wait. Come in. Hey. I think I need to get my house key back from you. Look, I don't want us to be over, And I don't think you do, either. There's just too much uncertainty in my life right now. We're teenagers. Nothing is certain. This relationship feels like kind of a big deal, And I don't want you to throw it away Just because you're scared of getting hurt. I don't know what else to do. I promise not to cheat on you... Or lie to you, or force you to love my dog. ♪ Oh, I think I hear broken words ♪ Uh, you have to go. My kids could be here. So? You said val knows. Well, knowing you exist is one thing, But seeing me drag you into my bedroom is... That's another. So, is anybody home? No. Good. ♪ The possibility at all of sleeping ♪ ♪ lying on my own ♪ my body's straight, I feel for more ♪ I really like you. Aww, I like you, too. But I just ended a 20-year marriage 5 minutes ago, And, uh, I'm incredibly late for work. I have to close tonight. Elaine, I need to say something important here. You're the boss. Get someone else to close. ♪ Oh, I think I hear I don't know how long jack will be. It's bizarre, isn't it? This is how it all started. If you hadn't chosen me as a subject, If you'd been another photographer, We'd all be a lot happier right now, wouldn't we? I wish things could be different. I do. What? You think all this was inevitable? It's not all that hard to walk away, you know, to just move on. People do it all the time. Look, mr. Karsten. Jack cares about your family. He'll never turn on you. People want him to, but he won't. That's how loyal he is to you. Loyalty is not the first word that comes to mind To describe jack, at least not since he met you. Thatcher. I'll be in the back room. I have some prints drying. Is this really what you want, jack? To live out this ridiculous dream? You're not 20 years old anymore. How long before you stop and ask yourself, "what was I thinking? Six months from now, a year? We both know what happens, what always happens. You wake up. I'm not coming back, thatcher. I'm not gonna ask again, you know. You won't have to. Hello? Theringer: Jules whitman? This is quincy theringer from the fbi. We need to talk. Oh, come on. Okay. My turn. Come on. Let's go. I got it! I got it! Pop? You didn't come home tonight. I t-thought you might be mad at me. You feeling better? Yeah. All better. What happened yesterday, t.J.? Did you make a mistake taking your medication? I did. Was it on purpose? Well, I got confused. It won't happen again, I promise. Come here. I made it! Yay! Is that me and jack? Yeah. You both tried out for football that year. You made it. He didn't. But you wouldn't join the team without him. Well, he was my brother. He wouldn't have done the same thing for you. Yeah, he would. Don't say that. Jack's never coming back, is he, dad? No. We have to forget about jack. It's just you and me now. Are you okay? He saved me. I mean, he took me into his family When he could have just let me disappear Into the foster system, Some immigrant kid lost in the mess. Maybe someday he'll forgive you. Not a chance. You're late. My apologies. Thanks for coming. Make it worth my while. I want to cooperate. Do you? So I'm gonna tell you the truth. It's... it's not that easy. There are a lot of reasons why I wanted to keep this a secret. Those reasons are not as compelling as they used to be. What secret is that? The person who put the gun in t.J.'s car was jack mcallister. Jack is the one who killed lou mrozek. Synced & corrected by * Rambo Media Ltd *
