 ************* The first transatlantic telegraph cable was made of 340,500 miles of copper and iron wire, designed to stretch 2,876. 95 miles along the ocean floor. Once the cable was in place, you could use electrical impulses and signal code to send any message you wanted to the other side of the world. Human beings are hard-wired with the impulses to share our ideas... ************* and the desire to know we've been heard. It's all part of our need for community. That's why we're constantly sending out signals and signs. It's why we look for them from other people.

 We're always waiting for messages. {\a6}************* Hoping for connection. ************* And if we haven't received a message, it doesn't always mean it hasn't been sent to us. Sometimes it means we haven't been listening hard enough. Okay,we already cleared it with the director, and he's done with his therapy,so...we're ready. Thank you. I appreciate this. Sundays are always spent with family. Just... be back by 5:00. Okay. H-Hold on one sec. Is everything all right? Y-Yeah. I got some news today.

 Not exactly news,I was expecting it,but... now the state of New York has told me definitively. If it's something about Jake's case... No,no,it's not about Jake,it's about his mother. Apparently there are limits to our current DNA technology. "...deeply regret to inform you we can find no further linkages." They've hit the endpoint for trying to identify victim's remains. I'm sorry. I just... I... just wanted something. A piece of her,to... put in the ground. I wouldn't have cared if it was just ashes, I...kind of wanted to be able to look up in the sky and know where Sarah was before the buildings came down. When Jake was a baby,I traveled a lot for work. The truth is,I wasn't there for her. I wasn't there for Jacob. I thought I had all the time in the world. I was thinking about going to the cemetery today, but it's not really the place for him. It's exactly the place for him. You're acknowledging that you miss her. Jake deserves the chance to witness that. You might be right. You remember this place? You know,sometimes when people die... they're just gone. They don't leave anything behind,well... nothing physical. Mommy was like that. But at least we've got this place to remember her,right? Jake... Jake! Jake,you can't run here! Excuse me,but this is my wife's grave,and I don't believe we've met before. No. No,but I knew Sarah. My name's Martin. Bobby. Bobby Ariza. How'd you know Sarah? Summer of 2001. I was a bike messenger; she was on my World Trade Center route. I saw her every couple of days,and,uh... we became friends. Summer of 2001. That's right before she... I'm sorry,I can't let him get that far away. I'll be right back. Jake! Hey,buddy. Stay close,okay? Guess what? I just met one of Mommy's friends. Where's he going? I wanted to talk to him. Hey,I bet if we chased him,we can catch up to him. What do you think? Jake? Nine point five,nine point five. Nine and a half. 9:50. Okay,Jake,we'll follow it. Jake! -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- -=http://ytet.org=- proudly presents -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- Sync:?۷?  Touch Season 01 Episode 04 Buddy,it looks like the traffic got your kite. There's got to be a toy store around here somewhere. Come on... Jake. Come on. Sweetheart,what's wrong? Jake,I'm trying to understand what you want,but you've got to help me out,please. Damn it. It's like a game of hot and cold. {\a6}************* "9.5 percent." Where are you taking me,Jake? Nine point five. 9.5,okay. ************* - Transfer of power happened,yes? - Yep. There are barely any Americans here now. You need morale,back at the embassy. We can help you. He is head of Deep Lightning band. Raw metal power. - You guys are in a band together? - Oh,not me. I warm up the crowd,like Chris Rock. All of my customers like this. I am a crossover hit,baby. All right.Uh,tomorrow,when we come by on this training patrol, - we'll see what you got. - Okay. - All right? All right. - Thank you. text *************** move ****************** we ************ Laura! Guess who got the audition? Congrats,Abdul. You must watch. You inspired me with all of the Chris Rock DVDs. Tomorrow,I will tell all of his jokes. And if this goes well,next stop is the U.S. Embassy. Okay,I'll do what I can to be there. I'm on a 30-minute string,so I might have to go out in the field if something comes up. But if I'm here,I will absolutely come to your audition. Okay. Thank you! Thank you. metallica ************* {\a6}************* And that's why Jesus says that he is here for the righteous. Oh,hold on. I'm sorry,no,uh... Sorry. I can't read my own writing,sorry. Uh,Jesus says that he is not here for the righteous,Yeah. "Not here for the righteous,but for the sinners." Exactly. For the sinners. All right,now let us all turn in our Bibles to Luke,verse nine,chapter five. I mean,chapter nine,verse five... where Jesus says that we should dust off our feet as we leave the homes of those that will not welcome us. Good to see you,Jim. All right,have a nice day,dear. It's good to have a new face here. What brings yo to our church? I saw your sign. I gotta tell you,that's a lot of false advertising. That whole "he has the answers" thing? Y-You didn't give us a single answer. Thank you. For your honesty. It's a,uh,welcome change from the usual. Hey,could I,uh... could I offer you a refill on that coffee? Sure. Jake! Wait for the light! ************* Jake. Jake! Jake... slow down Jake.That's the last apartment,65. I'm sorry. There is no 95,sweetheart. We're going to have to look somewhere else,okay? Jake? Come on,kids,I told you,no more playing soccer in the hallway... You following me? Jake's kite got away from us,and we were looking for it. And he just walked into this building. But I have to say,I think our paths were supposed to cross. Right now's not a good time. I'm not just talking about Sarah's grave. I'm talking about why I'm standing here right now. I know this is gonna sound crazy,but does the number 9.5 or 9 1/2 mean anything to you? No. No,listen,my wife is going to come back in a few minutes. So,I would appreciate it if you just please leave. Look,I was just wondering,you said that you and Sarah were friends. You must have been really young,right? 22,23. Old enough. Old en... - Jake! - Jake! You can't be in here. Let me just handle this,please. Okay,if you touch him... Just let me handle this. Jake,sweetheart,we can't just come... You have a daughter. Her name is Sarah. Yeah. LT,this is Sullivan. - We are clear of checkpoint four. - Copy that,Sullivan. How far behind is our escort? Far enough so that we arrive alone. The message said we have to meet as equals. We bring a vehicle,he brings a vehicle. Otherwise,he won't do the meet. - Okay,let's back off and give him some space. - Roger that. When I translate for you,I'll tell him our car's still bigger than his. LT,you okay?! Get over there. We got to help them! I'll... We're taking fire! Multiple snipers on the rooftop! We're taking fire from all directions! They got us pinned down! Only one way to go,then. Well,my grandpa,the,uh,first Steve Whitaker-- now,he truly had a gift for helping people. He built this church. He left it to his son,Stephen Junior. My daddy,uh,he was a believe,too, but what he really excelled at was maintaining the church's upkeep. Dad passed right after I was ordained. Stuck around just long enough to make sure I fulfilled my obligations. Uh,I guess I'm,uh,glad he's not here to be disappointed by my lack of answers. Nobody seems to have the answers,not that I can tell. So,you're on a spiritual quest,then. Just trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do with some money I came into, so I can make amends with some people. Doing some renovations? Oh,this is just maintenance. My daddy had some grand design for the church, but I've never had the time to get it going. Looks like your dad did want to expand the place. With a reception hall in the back,new footings in the basement. You got a knack for that kind of stuff,huh? My old man was in the construction business. I spent a lot of summers working for him. Yeah? Well... My dad always talked about that reception hall when he had his stroke and... I had to change my plans out of high school to stay and take care of him. Truth is,I've been chained here ever since. Where were you going before? Well,my class of '95 plan was to follow my girlfriend up to New York. Go to school up there like she did. - New York's not all it's cracked up to be. - Yeah. Is that where you're from? Well,I spent the last 15 years there. But actually,I'm originally Lynchburg. Born and bred. Well,your family must be glad to have you home. They don't know I'm here. I told them I'd let them know when I arrived but I've been putting off calling. You mentioned in the sanctuary that you needed to make amends. Do you mind if I ask what for? I think I let someone die. I understand that you're busy, but there's so many things about Sarah's life that last summer that I don't know; I would be so grateful if you could just tell me anything that you remember. You're right. We're intruding. I'm-I'm sorry. We'll leave. Jake. Come on,we got to go. Thank you. S-Sarah was a great lady. Look,the reason why we became friends was because, out of everybody I delivered to, Sarah was the only one that gave a damn about what was going on with me. She always asked to see pictures of my little boy. She loved kids. She said they made life complete. It sounds like her. And she always said that I shouldn't be risking my neck on a bike out there in Manhattan, not with a family at home. But... I couldn't get a promotion to dispatcher without my GED. So,Sarah volunteered to tutor me in math. Every Wednesday at lunch time. I got my GED,and then I got that promotion,too. Turned my whole life around. You know,I owe your wife a debt that I can't ever repay. So,she tutored you the entire summer,so you spent time with her right up until the end. That's right. Thing is,she never mentioned you to me. Like you said,there was a lot you didn't know. Well,maybe there's a couple other things you can tell me, like why you ran off at the cemetery, or why you're afraid your wife would find us here. Listen... I don't know what problems you were having with your marriage or anything... What did you just say? Where I'm from,when a woman stops wearing her wedding ring, it means something. She wasn't wearing her wedding ring? No. Maybe if you weren't traveling so much in Bolivia - or whatever,she would actually thought... You don't know me. You don't know a damn thing about me. So,for your information,it was the Balkans,not Bolivia. And I was a reporter,that's what I did for a living. It was my job. So don't you dare insinuate that I abandoned my family. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But,uh... How could I possible know that those damn buildings were going to come down? How could I... How could I possible know that? I did. I was on my route,next to the tower,when that first plane hit. They were telling people to stay inside-- stay in their offices-- and I knew that was wrong. It was wrong. I knew that I should've... helped people get out. I... helped,uh... get Sarah. But I didn't. I froze. I was scared. I... I never forgive myself for that. I'm so sorry. Who's this? Jake. I'll get him. Jake. Jake! Jake,unlock the door. Jake,unlock the door now! Her name was Sarah Bohm. I carried her down 31 flights of stairs. The whole time she was saying these names,Martin and Jake. Martin and Jake. She wanted me to find them for her. So I asked her,"Were they in the towers somewhere? " But... she didn't answer. And then I saw that she wasn't breathing. At least I-I thought she wasn't breathing. I guess I told myself... she was already dead. The truth is... I couldn't carry her anymore. I wanted to save myself. I'm so ashamed. I can't change what I did. I just wanted a way to move on. So I started obsessing about the numbers from that day... nine,eleven,87th floor,31 flights of stairs. And then I figured if I used the numbers to win the lottery... somehow it'd make sense. It'd give me permission to... move on. But after all these years... I finally won. And I don't feel any different. Maybe you just need some time. Maybe. Maybe I just need something to keep me busy. Well... you could do me a favor. You want to show me,uh,what the heck a footing is? I don't know. It really wouldn't take that much to fix this place up. Well,friend,I wouldn't even know where to begin. Jesus was a carpenter,but guess who can't swing a hammer... Oh,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no. I just locked us in here. I'm gonna try to find us a route back to a safe checkpoint. Hold up. I got to stop the bleeding. Still coming after us. - So we'll keep going. - Where? Away from the bad guys. You know,a friend of mine used to say you can get anywhere you want one foot step at a time. You and I are gonna prove him right. can't ******* it's *********** but ********* lucky *********** {\a6}************* and ***************** Dear King Roadie.

Had a visual on Davis and Shea heading out of the desert. I lost them in the dark.  Continuing to search. They're both wounded. If we don't find them,they'll never survive out here. Jake,open the door now! And this man's wife was your teacher? - Yes,but a long time ago. - Jake! - This might work. - Okay,thanks. Sarah saw something in me that nobody else saw. - Sarah? Did you name our daughter after her? - Yes. Bobby,I don't understand... Why did you keep all this a secret from me? Jake. Jake! Jake... You get in here now,you hear me?! Son of a... Jake,look,I know you wanted me to come here, but we're not helping anybody, so please,just get back inside. Damn it,Jake! Don't you do it! Jake! Jake! Jake! No,wait! Okay,okay.

I think we're actually gonna have to open up the window and check the satellite dish. Do you maybe think you could help me out with that? There's not enough room in this place for you and me and all your stuff. Ann-Marie! Are you okay,baby? Jake,sweetheart,don't you understand? It is my job to make sure that you're safe. Please. What's he doing up there? Every time I go after him,he just climbs even higher. Wait a minute. You don't want me to come and get you. You want him. - You gotta get him. - Why? Bobby,look,I can't explain it all, but the kite,the cemetery,9.5,it all leads to this moment. He wants you to get him,not me. ************* Get my son,Bobby. Go! - What are you doing? - Just wait. Jake... He's coming up,Jake. Don't go any higher,Jake. I got the kite. You got to grab him. He'll go ballistic. Just hold on to him tight. Okay,okay,okay. Jake,just hold on! All right,just hold on a second,Jake. No! Jake,don't go out there. Jake,come on. I can get the kite. Just come down,Jake. Jake,just do what he says! Jake,come on down. Come on down. I can get the kite. Come on,Jake. I can get the kite,come on. No! Jake! It's okay,Bobby. Let him go. Jake... Jake... Earlier,you said you wanted to repay your debt to Sarah? You just did. You saved his life. Thank you. hey. king *********** he ***************** what? 950? seems ********** king ********* Boo-ya! We're now five klicks from the last checkpoint. Still no sign of Davis and Shea. Your operation is compromised. You need to return to base. Negative. I will not leave them out here. I'm gonna circle back and keep looking. There's got to be a way to find them. You can do it,Shea. Come on. One... step... at... a time. One... one step at a time. I got a visual! I found Davis! West-northwest of my position. Send an evac chopper to coordinates 3095! All these windows have bars on them. Sorry I got you into this mess. It's not your fault. I played my numbers. They reset my karma. That's why I'm here. Whatever happens next,is meant to be. You know,I realized that I envy you. What the hell for? You received a sign. Through your numbers. You know who,uh,received signs in the Bible? Prophets. Holy people. Leaders. People with something worthwhile to do. Something important to say. You know who didn't receive any signs at all? Everyone else who doesn't get mentioned in the Bible. People who live their lives... without meaning. People like me. Jake. I'm sorry for the trouble. - I'm just glad your son's okay. - Thank you. You asked about a number. About 9.5? It probably doesn't mean anything,but... I remember September 5,2001, was my last session with Sarah. She showed up late that day. Said she had another appointment. That was September 5. Nine/five. He looks like her. You notice that? Every single day. Come on,Jake. I can break this window. At least I can yell for help... Pastor Steve? - Pastor Steve? - Yes! Are you in there? I need your help,we're in the basement! Watch your step. What on earth? Dry rot. Just... call 911! Pastor,something's happened in Iraq. Laura's been wounded. How bad? She's been medevaced to an Army base in Germany. She's about to go into surgery. She wants to talk to you. - To me? - Of course. All right. Listen,I want to talk to her,but this man needs medical attention,all right? - So call 911 on the church landline. - If it works. Hello? Steve. I'm so glad my brother found you. He says that you're hurt. What happened? I... I was with a guy from my unit... Corporal Shea... when we got lit up by sniper fire. They said my wound is septic. It's really bad. - Oh,my God,Laura... - But out in the desert... I just kept thinking about what you told me in high school. About moving ahead one footstep at a time. It kept me going. All the way to where they found us. You helped save Corporal Shea's life. And... whatever happens to me,I just,I wanted to tell you... Don't... talk like that. You're gonna come out of that surgery just fine. And I'm gonna be there as soon as I can. I promise you. - You don't have to come here. - Yes,I do. Listen to me. This church doesn't need me anymore. I've been given a sign. I'm leaving it all behind me now. What do you mean,"She's gone"? Lieutenant Davis was flown out by medevac. She was wounded in an ambush. That's what happens when you include the nationals. "Include" them? They live here! We live here! We include you! Get it? Then let me break it down for you,brother. Iraqis have been here forever. Since Mesopotamia. We started our party 9,000 years ago. We have been around almost as long as,uh... as long as The Simpsons. Want to audition now? - Yeah? - Yes. All right. Go ahead. In spite of all our communication technology, no invention is as effective as the sound of the human voice. * By the glaze in your eye   By your shape,by your size * * By the pen in your heart  By the art in your room * * By your bicycle * * By the hole in your shoe   By New York,by the blue * * By the song in your throat  By the sting in your nose * * By your watermark * When we hear a human voice, we instinctively want to listen, in the hopes of understanding it. Even when the speaker is searching for the right words to say. Even when all we hear is yelling,or crying,or singing. * You can pull on the chain You can knock on the door * * You can sing in the rain You can roll on the floor * * You can separate * That's because the human voice resonates differently from anything else in the world. That's why we can hear a singer's voice over the sound of a full orchestra. We will always hear the singer,no matter what else surrounds it. September 5. Nine/five. Sarah's appointment. "B.A. " Bobby Ariza. ************* Normally,we wouldn't hold an item for so many years, but...it was a wedding ring,after all. It's my wife's ring. That's why she wasn't wearing it. She couldn't wear it while it was being engraved. "One plus one equals three." That's what she used to say when our son was born. Jake made us a family. One plus one equals three. Sir? Do you still want this ring? Yes. Please. -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- -=http://ytet.org=- proudly presents -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- Sync:?۷?
