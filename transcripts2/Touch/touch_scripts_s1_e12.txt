 A billion nanoseconds. And the one constant,connecting nanoseconds to years,is change. The universe.From atom to galaxy, is in a perpetual state of flux. But we humans don't like change. We fight it. It scares us. So we create the illusion of stasis. We want to believe in a world at rest,the world of right now. Yet our great paradox remains the same... The moment we grasp the "now"... that "now" is gone. We cling to snapshots. Hello? But life is moving pictures.

 Excuse me... Each nanosecond different from the last. Are you Jimar Becko? Time forces us to grow. To adapt. Because every time we blink our eyes... the world shifts beneath our feet. It's time. I know it's hard. Some you just get really attached to. He's a pretty special kid. They all are. Have you told Mr. Bohm? We spoke a few minutes ago. How'd he take it? I realize you two have grown close. I know this strained your relationship,Clea... I did what's best for Jake. I forgot that was even under there. I made some calls. I found a great lawyer. She specializes in family law. It's too late for that. Come on. It's never too late. Look,you lost custody,but there's steps we can take. - They're moving him. - What? When? Today. They just called. They're transferring him to a long-term care facility - 50 miles upstate. Wait a minute. They can do that? They have custody of him now. They can do whatever they want. Well,let me call the lawyer. We can stop this. No. - Martin,it's our best chance. - I'm not waiting another day. I should never have let them take him in the first place. I let him down when he needed me the most. The first night when Jake was gone was one of the worst nights in my life. I should have just gone and gotten him then. - Martin... - This entire process is a big lie. Stay calm. Be patient... Okay,let's think this through. This isn't the first time this has happened. Teller was working with a girl who was just like Jake. Her name was Amelia. When they wanted her,they faked her death and made her disappear. I'm not letting that happen to my son. What are you going to do? Whatever it takes. That's right,1917 Henley & Hagan,solid brass sextant... Shipped it yesterday. Should be getting there anytime. Martin. I need to buy a gun. - What kind of gun are you looking for? - Anything you can sell me. Do you even know how to handle a gun? I don't plan on using it. Prison's filled with guys ho said the same thing. You don't unders... Look,today,I just need people do what I tell them,okay? - You sure you want to do this? - Arnie,are you going to sell me the gun or not? 300 even. Okay. I'll take it. One... two... three... Okay. Thank you. Martin! You were my friend when I needed one. You saved my life. Today,let me be your friend. Whatever this is about,don't do it. I don't have a choice. Martin! You forgot the bullets. Mr.Becko,I've come all the way from America to do this. I told you I'm not interested. I don't play anymore. But you're Jimar Becko. You're one half of the Becko Brothers,the voice of Jamaican peace and freedom. I don't sing. I don't play. Not since me brother gone. And I'm here to change that. It's Frank. Leave a message Hey,it's me. I know you asked me not to call, but I-I just need to know that the man who called about Amelia, did he leave a number to reach him? She's not dead,Frank. I know you don't believe me. But I know in my heart it's true. So please,please call me if you have the information,all right? Thanks. Got ya all packed up. Big day,huh? A lot is going to change now,Jake. And change can be difficult. I hope you understand we're only doing what we believe is best for you. Having you here,getting to know you... it's meant so much to me. I hope that somewhere inside you can feel that... how much I've come to care for you. You want some popcorn? Maybe you can write me a message like you did once before,remember? I guess not. Mr.Bohm?! Well... that's about it. Looks like we're done. Couldn't we fix up these pews too? I mean,sometimes these mortise and tenon joints get wobbly. What do you know from mortise and tenon? Lots. Back in the age of the sail, you had to be able to fix your own mast at sea. Like,if a cannonball hit it or something. Makes sense. - Hey,there you are. - Morning,Gwen. Oh,sorry. It's bad enough he's here every day after school, but now I can't stop him from running over here right after he brushes his teeth in the morning. I don't mind. He's been a great help. Is that for me? I don't know. Did you order a 1917 Henley & Hagan sextant from some pawn shop in New York? Cool. I've got to go see what latitude we're at. Okay. But don't look at the sun,okay? Okay,Mom. - He's a great kid. - Yeah. He told me at breakfast that he invited you to dinner tonight. Just so you know,he didn't ask me. Oh,if it's a problem... No,no,it's not a problem,but please don't feel obligated. The thing is,Colin has really taken to you. And you have to understand that he was only four when his dad left. So he tends to cling to people who are kind to him. Especially men. My point is... I didn't want to get his hopes up about dinner because I didn't know if you were staying in town much longer, now that the church is done. I-I-I guess it is done,isn't it? Yeah. To be honest,Gwen... I don't know what comes next. I guess I'm waiting for the next sign. Well,you are more than welcome to join us tonight,if you like. I mean,nothing fancy. Just turkey burgers and Brussels sprouts. But,uh,please don't feel obligated if you have anything else... - I like Brussels sprouts. - Great. A lot. That's great. Then I guess we'll see you tonight. Well,Mr.Bohm,it's best that your good-bye's kept short. Let him know that you love him,and that you'll see him soon. I don't need advice from you on how to say goodbye to my son. The visit will be brief and supervised, as is protocol for a non-custodial parent. His things are all packed. He's waiting inside the rec room now. Thanks,Clea. Mr.Bohm Hey,buddy. That's not Jake. I don't understand. Where is he? Check his room. Check the exits. What's going on? Where is my son? We'll find him. He was sitting right there when I came out to get you. Mr.Bohm,I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Are you kidding? You lost him. I am sure he's somewhere inside the building. Make sure he finds his way out. This is outrageous. Clea,now. Mr.Bohm,come with me. I put Jake in a cab and gave the driver your address. Don't worry. I called your building. The doorman's gonna make sure he gets into your apartment. Clea,I don't know what to say. - Go. He's waiting. - Thank you. I'm gonna check the downstairs exit. He's unlocked that door before. You and I need to talk. Jake. Jake! Oh,no. No. What the...? What? 4370 4370... Sarah. Hey,that's mine. *********** You see them,too. The numbers? I know you can't see me. I'm the invisible prince. It's all right. Nobody can. I write numbers,too. See? Guards of the empire. They're looking for you? Say no more. Here. Take this letter of transport. It will assure your safe passage. I'll distract the guards,and you cross the threshold. Okay? First I must become visible. Yeah. I'm ready. Safe travels,good sir. Safe travels. Officers. Officers. Uh,uh,I seek 34th street. Now,I'm told it lies yonder,you know,between 33rd and 35th. I think this thoroughfare here might be the wisest route. Damn it! I assume you're kicking the door 'cause nothing else worked? Mechanic wanted 500 bucks to fix it. I told him if I couldn't get it started... he could keep it. Got to keep moving. I'm looking for someone. Yeah,who's that? This Jamaican guy. He's a musician. Heard he was in Portland. And in Portland they told me San Luis Obispo. So... What about you? Where you headed? Not sure. I'm looking for someone,too. No.No offense, but I've seen one too many horror films about women picking up hitchhikers. Sorry. I totally get it. - Sweet. - What? I just posted some raw footage of this project... I've been working on... Yeah. Baaba Maal singing "Three Little Birds" in Mali,West Africa. Nice. I just posted an hour ago,I already got 318 hits. 318? Yeah. Why? Nothing. Just that that was a very important number to my daughter,is all. 318 San Luis Obispo. - Seriously? - Seriously. - If your stuff fits in the back. - It will. Okay,so,I'll start with the altitude. Give me some numbers. Any numbers. What? Like one to ten? No. Like 87 and... 31 So 87 degrees... Locked. Now I'm dialing 31 minutes in the micrometer. How many seconds do you want to add on to that? Eleven. Eleven. Okay. So to get the azimuth,I need three more numbers. One. Nine. 20 Those are my numbers. Show me how that thing works. It's for navigation. For getting from point A to point B. From this position I can look up at something in the sky and find out where we are. How do you find where you're going? Are you okay? These numbers on the blueprint... 87,one,nine,20,31,11... those are my numbers. - The ones I won the lottery with. - Really? Every time I've seen these numbers. They meant something important. So if you're saying putting these numbers in your sexton can point to a place somewhere on a map... I'd really like to know where that place is. Jake! Jake. I saw the message you left me,buddy. You mom's birthday. You wanted to say good-bye to your mom. Pretty good idea. - Abigail? - Martin,what the hell have you done? - What do you mean? - The police were just here. People from Aster Corps have been calling, people I've never even heard of. They've put out an Amber Alert for child abduction. I didn't abduct anybody. Jake ran away. I just found him. And as far as anybody else should be concerned, I'm still looking for him. It should buy me a little time. Right now I just need-to get Jake out of the state. How? You can't even take a train. You can't buy a plane ticket. You can't even drive your own car. I don't know,but we'll figure it out. - Martin,I don't think we should talk again. - Okay,I understand. I'll try and get in touch with you as soon as we settle. Jake. Jake,we need to go. I got to figure a way for us to get out of here, but we need to go now. Come on. Let's go. You really expect me to believe you had nothing to do with this? Jake escaped. He's done it before. If you know where they are,Clea, you are aiding and abetting. - You can go to jail for a long time. - I could go to jail? You look scared,Sheri. Whoever it is you're working for must be very unhappy about all this. - I want you out of here now. - I was just on my way. You're a criminal,Sheri. I know you're working for Aster Corps. I know you had Amelia hidden in room six. And I know that Arthur Teller's death wasn't an accident. I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about. Then I guess you got nothing to worry about. Thanks. You okay? Fine. Fantastic. My hus... uh,ex-husband sold our house today,so... And that's a bad thing? No. We agreed to sell it and split the money. It just feels pretty permanent. My daughter Amelia was born in that house. We did the whole touchy-feely thing,right? The midwife and the candles and the music,and... there I was the whole time swearing like a sailor on crack or something. And then,uh,last few years, I,uh,was kind of coming and going. I'd stay a few months,and try to work it out with Frank. And then,I'd discover some new breadcrumb, or some clue about my daughter,or... Anyway... Frank could always tell. He could see that look in my eye. And then,I'd be gone the next day. You know,the whole nuclear family thing? it's overrated. Stand in one place too long,you grow moss on your feet. Good point. Thank you. Thank God that's,uh,not a trap I have to worry about anymore,right? I'm sorry to ask this of you,but I need your help. I'm not surprised. You're a good man,Martin Bohm, but knowing you has a price. What are you talking about? Everything's gone. Teller's records,his files on Amelia,his entire life's work. My diamonds--they weren't interested in. Who did this? Yes,well,they didn't leave a card. I unlocked the door--this. So,what do you need? We have to get out of town unseen. Farther away,the better. Didn't know you had a car. Just bought it. Nice color. I didn't even notice. Uh,you do realize that the invite was for dinner,not lunch,right? Yeah. I mean,now that you're here,I could throw together a salad, but Colin's not even home from school yet. Listen,something's come up. I'm sorry,but I'm gonna have to leave town for a while. Really? How long is a while? I don't know,Gwen. I'm sorry. I came here looking for some answers. Maybe find some peace. But all I did was fix up a church. And what's wrong with that? Look around. You know,this is life,Randall. Maybe this is all you get. I mean,what are you even searching for? It's hard to explain. - I'm trying to pay back a debt. - To who? Someone who changed everything. She gave me a message to deliver,and until I do,I... Say good-bye to Colin for me,please. Yes. Yes,Michael. I'll tell him. Okay. An associate. His cousin works at a small bus station about an hour outside of the city. You'll be safe leaving from there. - Where are we going? - Come. I'll explain as we walk. Come on,buddy. We got to go. Come on,buddy. His name is Zev. He works at the center window of the three. He'll have two tickets waiting for you to Minneapolis. When you get there,call this number. They'll provide you with a place to stay until you get situated. Okay. Avram,I don't know how to thank you. - What is it? - Listen to me. Be careful. Whoever broke into my room last night knows about this building, knows about you. Keep one eye over your shoulder,yes? - I will. Thanks again. - Yes. You take care. Come on,buddy. We got to go. Good-bye,Jake. - This is it. - This? Okeydoke. So you've really done this 50 other times? Well,48,but yeah,that's the goal. 50 musicians,all in different countries,all singing the same song. Been around the world and back. I've been working on this for two and half years? Why? My dad was a record executive. Spent his life signing great musicians to bad deals. People just like the Becko Brothers. They poured their hearts into those records, creating timeless works of art,and... he just took their money away. He left me a little bit of cash. Guess I'm just trying to right some of his wrong? That must seem crazy stupid,huh? No. No way. You got to follow those dreams. You know,there was a time in my life when all I thought about was traveling the country with a camera,photographing trains. Really. There was something about all that steel,and metal-on-metal. I just wanted to capture it. Didn't quite work out that way,but maybe some day. I hope you find who you're looking for. I hope you do,too,Lucy. Can I help you? I'm looking for Thomas Becko? I've traveled a long way to see him. This... this is 3287 Alameda,right? Thomas isn't here. He won't be back for three months. Oh,excuse me,excuse me! I-I sort of hitchhiked here. Is there any way that I could please... use your bathroom? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're the best. Come on,buddy. We got to go. Two ticket to Minneapolis,Minnesota. We got to roll,young man. I'm sorry. Just give me one sec. Jake,look,I understand how hard this is leaving Mom,leaving your home,leaving everything, but we cannot stay in New York. I'm sorry. Just give me one sec. Jake,we cannot stay here,do you understand? We need to go! 4370.. 4370... I'm sorry. We have to change our ticket. It's too bad I missed him. Saw his brother a few weeks ago in Jamaica. You saw Jimar? How-How is he? Well,he misses his brother pretty bad. Doesn't understand why Thomas just disappeared on him like that. Musicians are tricky people. Jimar wants more than anything in the world just to sing with his brother again. I could see it in his eyes how badly he misses those sweet harmonies, and I can make that happen. Bring those voices together,from halfway across the world. Can you help me do that? Help Jimar sing with his brother again? It was never about Jimar. I love my brother. Well,I don't understand. You're their sister? I had no choice. I couldn't be who I really am. Not then,not there. The whole country knew me as Thomas. How could I explain it to Jimar,how it felt? Being trapped in your own body. Your brother wants to make music again. He won't do it without you. Turn right in 100 feet. Your destination is on the right. You have arrived at your destination. This is not right. Please enter a new destination. I don't have another destination. 4370,Los Angeles,California. Lane two. Jake,come with me now. Check those. Come on. Jake. Run! Stop. Just stop. So help me God,I'll kill you. Take it easy,Mr.Bohm. You're not going to pull that trigger. You're not the kind of man who shoots people. Please,I can't let you take my son. The boy is coming with me. You'll have to kill me first. Jake! Jake. Jake! - Look,please,we need your help. - Get in. Go. Go,go. What the hell happened back there? It may be too hard to explain. I never thought I'd run into you guys again. It's not a coincidence,Randal,trust me. How do you know my name? March 18. 3:18 in the train station. You were on the phone before we got in the fight. You were leaving me a message about my wife,Sarah. I'm Martin Bohm; this is my son,Jake. My God,you're Martin and Jake. For ten years I was scared to meet you. What you'd think of me. But I knew I had to. I mean,if not for me,at least for her. I found her on the 87th floor. She was in a lot of pain,so... I had to carry her real slow. But after a while,I couldn't go any farther. So,I-I put her down to rest. Then she told me about you and Jake. She said that's the reason she wasn't scared because she already had everything she ever dreamed of. Ever wanted. That's why I called you on March 18, to tell you how brave your wife was and how much she loved you both. It was my job to save her life. She saved my life. She would want you to let this go. Maybe for her sake,that's what we're supposed to do. Move on. When you got in the car,you said you needed help,that you're in some kind of trouble. There are these people that want to take my son away from me, so we were trying to get to California. - Take my car. - No,I couldn't do that. Martin,you said yourself,this is no coincidence. You need a car. I'm giving you one. It's not even registered; there's no plates. It's brand-new. It's yours. Wait. Thanks. Thank you,Martin. Hello? Hey,it's me. I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. I'm fine. Should I ask where you're headed? It's probably better that you don't. I'll try to call as soon as we get settled. Look,I don't know how to thank you for everything that you've done,but... You can thank me later. Say good-bye to Jake. I will. Talk to you soon. Every day,every moment,every nanosecond the world changes. Electrons bump into each other and react. People collide and alter each other's paths. * Rise up this morning * * Smile with the rising sun * * Three little birds * * On my doorstep * * Singin' sweet songs * * A melody that's pure and true * * Saying,this is my message to you * sidney ********* saindhavi ************* blind ********* marcio ********* waltis *********** chandrajit *********** fernando ********** ********** More often,it's wrenching and difficult. ********** But maybe that's a good thing. Because it's change that makes us strong. Keeps us resilient. - Happy... Day. - Santa Monica! It teaches us to evolve. Jake. Well,this is it,buddy. Can't go any farther west than this. Still not exactly sure what we're doing here. What is it? Excuse me? I-Is this yours? Oh,yes. Thank you so much. Yeah. - A weather map? - Yeah. My,uh,son's into numbers. Oh,it's beautiful,isn't it? I've never been to this part of the country before. Yeah. What brought you out here? Looking for my daughter. What's your daughter's name? Amelia. Amelia. * Don't you worry * * About a thing * * 'Cause every little thing * * Is gonna be all right * -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- -=http://ytet.org=- proudly presents -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- Sync: ?۷?
