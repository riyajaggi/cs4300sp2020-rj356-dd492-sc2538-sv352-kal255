 Touch (2012â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 2 - 1+1=3 - full transcript 
 Despite she witnessing Jake's possible communication through numbers and despite Jake having run away to home, Clea is still convinced that Jake is better off under Child and Family Services care. Before Clea whisks Jake away, Jake gives his father what Martin believes is a local telephone number. That number does lead Martin to a pawn shop owned and operated by Arnie Klepper. After visiting the shop, Martin believes that part of his purpose was to prevent the armed robbery that occurred while he was in the shop. Arnie is however ungrateful for Martin's appearance as Martin's action led to Arnie suffering a gunshot wound - a superficial one but a gunshot wound nonetheless. Meanwhile, Jake is able to run away once again, he who ultimately leads Martin to the rationale for the number, which will include in its story a Russian boy who wants the friendship of his classmates but who doesn't understand why they don't like him, a peanut vendor with serious money problems, a flight attendant whose current task is to track down a dog that was scheduled to depart on one of the flights but who escaped, a South Asian man who is in town to spread his dead father's ashes in the center of New York Stadium, an oft stolen seventh game league winning home run baseball, and the power of magic and second chances.

 My name is Jake. I was born 4,165 days ago, on October 26, 2000. I live on this planet with 7,080,360,000 other people. This is a story of some of those people. Today the average person will say 2,250 words to 7.4 other individuals. We'll send over 300 billion e-mails, 19 billion text messages, all adding to the giant mosaic of patterns and ratios. Mathematical in design, these patterns are hidden in plain sight.

 You just have to know where to look, but only some of us can see how the pieces fit together. It's all been predetermined by mathematical probability, and it's my job to keep track of those numbers, to make the connections for those who need to find each other... the ones whose lives need to touch. I was born on October 26, 2000. I've been alive for 11 years, four months, 25 days, and 13 hours, and in all that time... I've never said a single word. But that's okay. I have someone who hears me now. I'm not taking him back there.

 I covered for you, told them he was safe with you for the night, but he needs to come back. He was trying to communicate with me. You saw that for yourself last night. Yes, I saw it, and I'm not saying that what Jake's capable of isn't... incredible, but it doesn't change his situation. It changes everything. In 11 years he's never said a word; I've never been able to touch him; And now I can hear him. I know what he wants. Last night this is the number he dialed from the cell tower. He wants me to find this guy. I don't know why. I don't even know how. All I know is that I have to. Mr. Bohm, please. Look at your situation. You're a single parent, no mother in the home. With your job, you can barely provide for his special needs. He's escaped every school he's been sent to. I'm not the enemy here. Jake ran away from a locked facility last night. That is serious. I'm trying to keep the state from taking him away from you for good. So, please, can you just... go to work, stay below the radar, and let me try to help your son? Can you do that for me? I'm sorry. No, I can't. Well, I'm sorry. 'Cause I'm gonna have to call the police. You'd do that? Wait, wait. Hey, buddy. Miss Hopkins is going to take you back to the board and care facility just for a few weeks. She's going to take really good care of you, I promise, a-and I'm gonna be able to get to see you every day. Okay? You want me to take that, yeah? Paying you to surf the Internet now, Bohm? Sorry, I was just... 15 minutes left on your shift. Come with me. Got a special delivery to a connecting flight at Terminal 3, leaving for Moscow in half an hour. Okay. Lyov. Why don't you and I go for a ride? Pardon me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I have a plane to catch. Coming through. Sorry. You kidding me?! God! Excuse me. - Oh! For God's sake. - No, no, no, no, no. - No, no, no. - I'm sorry. I didn't see you. You came out of nowhere. Look, I've got to go see a man about a dog, but I can call for someone to clean up this dirt - for you. - It's not dirt. It's my father. Where the hell have you been? I had to come clear across the airport looking for you. - Sorry. I just got the call. - Uh-huh, sure you did. Can we just get him on the truck, please? It's not exactly flight attendant duty. Why have they got you handling it? Some Russian guy paid extra to have Lyov here hand-delivered. I'm supposed to meet the courier in Moscow. Good luck. Yeah, thanks for everything. No, wait! No, no, no. Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop that dog. Somebody stop that dog! Lyov! Come here, puppy! Here, boy! Hey, Jake. What you doing there? Boy, you sure like numbers don't you? They're all the same-- 5296 over and over again. Does it mean something, Jake? Is it a message? I know you like counting popcorn kernels. Maybe you can guess my phone number or my address. Want to give it a try? Okay, good. Should I count those with you? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven in that row there. One there, one there. Is it my birthdate maybe? Does it mean something, Jake? Why don't we put that book away for a while, huh? We can try playing with something else. We have all sorts of other things you can do your numbers with. How about some finger paint? You can paint on the easel here. Let me get you something to clean that up. Jake?

I tried to take a bus, but it dropped me right back off at the terminal. They can be a little hard to navigate if you don't know your way around. I'm still here, too. I was looking for a dog, so, I missed my flight. Generally frowned upon - in my line of work. - I'm sorry. Where are you trying to get to? New York Stadium. I'm taking my father there. - Ah. - He loved New York. He went to university here. Loved the city, the people. But ma'am, most of all, he loved the baseball. Hmm. My dad's a baseball fan, too. So I'm taking him to the stadium to spread his ashes in the center part of the field. I have yet to shed a tear for him. I am waiting until after I complete my task. It's a wonderful thing you're doing for him. Some of us will never get that chance... There's a taxi stand outside to the left. Just ask the driver, and he'll take you there. Thank you for your kindness. Good luck to you. Look, I don't have any place to be for a while, and... I haven't been to that stadium since I was a kid, so... Hello? It's okay. I'm ready. Excuse me? Who are you? I'm the guy that called the other night. I said I was... supposed to find you. Remember? Yeah. I thought you were crazy. Still do. What do you want? I don't know... yet. Look, it's kind of hard to explain, but I think I'm supposed to help you somehow. Help me what? I know it sounds crazy. My-My son led me here. And even though it doesn't make sense to either one of us right now, it will, it just... Who are you?! I-I'm nobody. I'm just a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Well, get down on the ground. Now! Give me the money. I got a gun under the counter here. Go ahead. Go for it. Don't be a hero. - Just give him what he wants! - I will shoot you, man! Better make it count before I get my gun. Shouldn't have done that, man. Like I said, he had a mask most of the time... I'm fine, damn it! Take your damn hands off me! You've been shot. You've got to go to the hospital. - Let me go with you. - Why? 'Cause you haven't caused enough trouble? Get this lunatic away from me. Look, I think I'm supposed to go to the hospital with you, okay? Please. So you can keep screwing up my life?! Leave me the hell alone, or I'm telling that cop there that you're stalking me. You understand?! Look at this. Watches. Huh? Uh, look at that. _ It's a joke, right? You're joking. Look, I-I... I had an arrangement for the whole $10,000, but it-it... it fell apart. I'm a simple man, mister. I make my money in honest way. I lend it; People pay me back. When they don't... things fall apart. Cause and effect... my friend. Cause and effect. No, wait, wait. What is it? This... is Patrick McGrath's home run ball from game seven of the 2009 League Championship. It's worth $50,000. $50,000. Yeah. You know that how? Because that's how much I got for it when I sold it, uh, the first time. See, now it's come back to me like magic, like for a reason. It's like a... like a second chance. You know, come on. You believe in that, right? Second chance. When one comes my way, I will let you know. You got three hours to get me my money. Go! Hey. _ So... who's our contact when we get to the stadium? Our what? You didn't make arrangements for this, - did you? - No. There's security issues, insurance. I don't know if they're gonna let you do this. But they have to. I promised him. I'm sure he'd understand. No, ma'am, he would not understand. It would prove that I'm a bad son. But you're a wonderful son. You came all the way here for him. He must have loved you very much. Loved me? No, he didn't even like me. I was a great disappointment for him. He preferred my sister. Well... why go to all the trouble? Ma'am, it is my duty... as his son. A child owes their father respect. Yes? Did... Did I say something wrong? The owner was shot and wounded. The robber got away. I... Was I supposed to stop the entire thing from happening? Did I even save the owner's life? How should I know? And if I did, why don't I know that that's why Jake sent me? It doesn't make any sense. Sense? Oh, is that what you're looking for-- sense? Well, I'm trying to figure this out. I'd like some answers. So it's about you, is it? What does that mean? You haven't been listening to me, Mr. Bohm. I told you before, what your son sees won't make sense to you. Here. What do you see? Numbers. I see numbers. When Jake looks at this, he sees the entire universe. It's all numbers to him. It's the past, the present, the future. He sees how they're all connected. You told me that before. The road map, my destiny, the connections. - I don't know what that means. - It is simple. Sometimes when the numbers don't add up, it means that there's some cosmic pain - that has to be healed. - Pain? That your son feels, senses. Something unresolved, unfinished in the world. He sees the pain as numbers. Your job is to follow where it leads. Blindly? If need be, yes. Where does that leave me? What am I supposed to do now? Just trust your son. He'll let you know. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - Yeah? - Mr. Bohm, Clea Hopkins. I don't know how to tell you this again, but Jake is gone. - What?! - I've looked everywhere. You got any idea where he could be? Oh, my God. Yeah, I got him. Oh, thank God. Jake! Jake? Jake?! Jake?! My son's run away. He's on your bus. - Just give me a second. - All right. Come on, Jake. We got to get off the bus. Jake, everybody's waiting for us to get off the bus. Come on. Are you staying or going? You want to stay on the bus? Is that what you want? It looks like we're staying. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Jake! Jake, the number you gave me earlier, it led me to here. Earlier this morning, there was a robbery. I couldn't stop that from happening, but I think I saved the owner's life. Is that what I was supposed to do? Is that why you gave me the number? Jake, please. I am trying so hard to do what you want me to. Just give me a sign, a hint, anything. 673-5296. 297. The number's wrong. Hello? Jake, there's no one here. We'll come back later, okay? I promise. Let's go. Jake. Jake. We shouldn't be in here. Jake. Put that back. "Arnold." Who the hell are you? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm a friend of... Look, we're here because... You're the guy I'm supposed to give the envelope to, right? Yeah. That's right. You know, it's weird, man. This morning, he told me he wasn't coming back for a while. It's like he knew they were gonna take him back - to the hospital. - Well, he must be doing better. These prescriptions are over two weeks old. They haven't even been opened. He thinks he can beat this on his own. Like, me, personally, I'd do medication, chemo, the works. Me, too. Hey, I'll get you the envelope, yeah? Thank you. I can go as low as 20, but not a penny less. But it's a legendary ball! It's a steal at 20! I can do 15. 15 and it's yours. Ten. Damn it! Well, there it is. Excuse me! Hi. Could we come in for a few minutes? Sorry. Closed to the public. Team's practicing. This man came all the way from India. Can't you just let us look around? Nope, game's Tuesday night. Sorry. Hey, come on, wait. It'll just take a minute, I swear... We'll figure something out. Don't worry. My sister was right. I've failed him again. You didn't fail. You made it all the way here with your father's ashes in a ceramic elephant. That's not a failure. I came to spread his ashes in the center part of the field. They have doors and guards and fences. Ma'am, I was a fool to think that I could even do this. You made a pilgrimage all the way here. You have your closure. Not everyone in the world gets that. Lyov?! I'm sorry, but if I want to keep my job, I have to get that dog. You have a great rest of your life, okay? Lyov! Come on! No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Lyov! Lyov! Come back here! What'd you get me into, Jake? Here you go, bro. Thank you. How'd you two get in here? Door was open. Was it? Who are you? I told you, I'm a friend of Arnold's. You mean Arnie, don't you? Come on. My kid's here. You should've thought about that before you broke in here. Jake! Go, Jake! Drive! Please! Drive! Jake, I'm sorry. I had to, okay? I'm sorry. You're okay now. You're okay. Where to? Just give me a second. Victory Memorial Hospital, please. Mr. Klepper? Arnie? He's not here, Jake. Come on. Let's go. Jake! Oh, no. Come on, Jake. We got to go. See you, boys. Mr. McGrath? Do you remember me? You're the peanut vendor. Lawsuit. You got the ball; What else do you want from me? Every kid grows up dreaming of catching a home run ball. Well, my dream came true, and then I... I sold it. That's when it started this whole chain of events, bad to worse. I just want to put it all back right. And to start with, I need to give this ball back to you. Oh... You couldn't just get me my money? You're really gonna make me do this to you, huh? It's like you said, Yuri, every man makes choices. Cause and effect. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ That second chance you were talking about... You go now. Arnie? Jake... stay right there. Arnie? What are you doing? - Oh, God. How did you... - I know about your cancer... and about the $10,000 you left in the envelope for the man who robbed your store earlier today. You were setting up a hit. He wasn't there to rob you; He was there - to kill you. - Until you showed up. Who are you? Why do you keep doing this to me? I told you, I was meant to find you. - To help you. - No one can help me; I'm dying. You don't know that yet. You haven't even gone through the treatment. I got no one to care, one way or the other. I read the note you left on your desk. You do have someone. What about Becca? She doesn't want a father. Won't even return my letters. I figured at least I could leave her some insurance money if I got killed in a robbery. I couldn't even get that right. So I'll go out the way I came in-- alone. You're not alone. I'm right here. You don't even know me. You're right. I don't. A-And I shouldn't care whether you live or die, but I do. Because it matters. It has to. That's why I was meant to find you. I've shown up twice today. That's hardly a coincidence. I don't think today's your day to die, Arnie. Please. Please. No! Let go! - Let me go! Let me go! - No. - No! You say... - Please, let me go. That nobody cares about you, that you don't have any friends. I care about you. I'll be your friend. I'll be your friend, Arnie. Lyov? Lyov! Dad! Becca? Oh, my God. You. You. Seven billion people on a tiny planet... suspended in the vastness of space... all alone. How we make sense of that is the great mystery of our frail existence. Maybe it's being alone in the universe that holds us all together... keeps us needing one another in the smallest of ways... creating a quantum entanglement... of you... of me, of us. And if that's really true... then we live in a world where anything is possible. There were so many things I wanted to teach you. That's, uh... how I always thought it was supposed to be. That that's what being a father was. Me teaching you. Now it turns out... it's you teaching me. And I want you to know that I'm okay with that. Okay, Jake? I'm okay. I understand now. It's a road map. You get some sleep, Jake. I'll see you in the morning. Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com Resync for WEB-DL by Norther
