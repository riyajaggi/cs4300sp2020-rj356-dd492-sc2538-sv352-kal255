 Previously on Touch... Okay, Jake, then you finish the pattern. The dodecahedron-- 12 sides, for the 12 zodiac signs our sun passes through in a year. It's said to represent the universe itself. Have him do it again. She's taking orders. Someone else was watching; I've got to find out who was on the other side of that computer. - What's wrong? - Aster Corps. They're continuing Teller's research.

 First it was Amelia. Now they're after Jake. In 1992, a shipping container fell overboard on its way from China to the United States, releasing 29,000 rubber ducks into the Pacific Ocean. Ten months later, the first of these rubber ducks washed ashore on the Alaskan Coast. Since then, these ducks have been found in Hawaii, South America, Australia, and traveling slowly inside the Arctic ice. But 2,000 of the ducks were caught up in the North Pacific Gyre, a vortex of currents moving between Japan, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and the Aleutian Islands. Items that get caught in the gyre usually stay in the gyre, doomed to travel the same path,

 forever circulating the same waters. But not always. Their paths can be altered by a change in the weather, a storm at sea, a chance encounter with a pod of whales. 20 years after the rubber ducks were lost at sea, they are still arriving on beaches around the world, and the number of ducks in the gyre has decreased, which means it's possible to break free. Even after years of circling the same waters, it's possible to find the way to shore. - Martin, please, sit down. - I don't want to sit down. I had three hours with my son this morning, but instead, I'm spending it here with you, so you can explain yourself. Fine. What do you want to know? Your company, Aster Corp, is running tests on my son-- why? Aster Corps has been interested in Jake since he was born. What are you talking about? This has been going on for over ten years. You were on assignment, as usual. Sarah came to me. Someone had approached her because of those tests they give you in the hospital, the standard Apgar test. He'd been flagged as special. They gave her this card. They wanted to follow up. Mobius. When I looked into it, I found out that Mobius was a front for Aster Corps. I know all about Mobius. What exactly do they want with him? I don't know. I mean, at first, I thought it was just research, you know, learning, memory, number processing. The thing is, these guys are 40 steps ahead of everybody on the planet; they're into everything... climate change, global warming,world population patterns. Martin, they're driven. And not just by power-- it's something else. They've got Sheri Strepling in their pocket,and I don't think she's the only one. you're insinuating that Clea Hopkins is part of this? No. I trust her. You can't trust anyone; you can't. And you sure as hell can't leave Jake's custody up to that review board. I get it. This is all about you getting custody of my son. Martin, I've been trying tell you the review board is rigged.You're gonna lose. But if you get custody of Jake, everything will be fine. We pre-empt them. No judge is gonna question my fitness or ability to provide. No. You don't have a choice. I could put Jake in my car right now and just get out of here. The state has temporary custody. You'd be arrested. Fine then... Jake! Jake, no! Oh, my God... Jake, come on. Jake, let's go now. Okay, Mr. Bohm. I'll be right back, buddy. I need you to sign here and here. Any idea what your son was thinking, dropping that thing? None. Just glad no one got hurt. Couldn't have picked a worse day to do it, though. Thanks. Social Services asked for you to wait downstairs. They're sending a case worker to take your son back to his board and care. A woman named Clea Hopkins. Okay, thanks. It's not exactly how I was hoping to spend the morning with you. It's okay, buddy. Things happen. Come on. Let's get out of here. Jake... -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- -=http://ytet.org=- Proudly Presents -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- -=http://ytet.org=- Sync:??־???? Touch Season 1 Episode 11 Jake... {\a6}**** What are you doing? Come on, Jake. Jake, we need to get out of here now. What the hell? Jerry, you got paper towels back there? In the closet. Somebody spilled a soda all over the floor. 2217... Jake... 2217. Amelia... Oh, my God. This is my beach! - Hey, give that back! - I staked this place out a week ago! You can join the clowns at the next beach over. You can't just grab that out of my hand. Sure I can. My beach, my Maneki Neko. - Your what-a-what-o? - See, you don't even know what it is. Maneki Neko-- it's a good luck charm. But not for you. Get your own beach. Wow, what are you doing in here? None of your business. Please leave. What is all this stuff? You picked all of this up on the beach? - This is private property. - It's a beach! On which I have established a private structure. Huh, a nylon tent on a public beach is not a private structure. Just get out, okay? I know what this is. This is from Japan, right? Wow! You figured that out all by yourself. - Please don't touch that. - This is from the tsunami. Am I right? I read about this. I read that there's still debris in the ocean, and it's being pushed by the currents, and they're going to be showing up for the next couple of years, is that right? Are you putting this stuff on eBay? Really? - What do you care? - What do I care? Do you realize that this is somebody's. This might have been some little girl whose house was destroyed in the flood.Somebody's daughter. You're making money off of people's pain. You don't care. - You're kind of despicable. - Whatever, lady. Why don't you go hate me from out there, okay? I've got work to do. How about I ruin your day instead? Hey! Take it easy! What are you doing? You can't sit here! My beach. - No, no, it's not. - Yes, yes, it is. See? I have established a private structure, and, as long as I'm here, you're not getting another thing that comes out of that ocean. What is this? The **** 22 *** This is nonsense. I'll **** Ton of money. Our son *** There is no harm *** I **** The *** We **** It's **** Why **** The **** Words **** It's **** There are **** We **** I will be **** To **** This is Teller's patient? Amelia? But it doesn't make sense. This says she's been dead three years. Car accident in Westchester County. But how can that be? We saw her on the security tape. Sheri lied to you about her being in board and care, and now you know why. - Because the world thinks she's dead? - Yeah. There's a petition in the file. The family wanted to reopen the case. Clearly, they didn't buy it either. So where is Amelia? Your guess is as good as mine. But we know she's alive. Jake wants me to find her. So that's what I have to do. How do you plan to do that? File says there was an autopsy. I'll start there. You think a medical examiner's just gonna give you information on an autopsy? I was a reporter. I have a knack for getting people to tell me stuff they probably shouldn't have. If that doesn't work, I'm pretty good at making fake I.D.s. I should get you back to board and care. About that, Abigail told me this morning that the review board's already been bought and paid for, that they're gonna take Jake no matter what. Is that even possible? No judge would agree to that without the support of all of Jake's caseworkers, including me. Don't worry. I'll look after Jake while you look for Amelia. Okay. Hey, buddy, I love you. I'm gonna be bringing you home soon, okay? I promise. - Okay, thanks. - Okay. Come on, Jake. - This case is three years old. - Yes, I know. The family petitioned to have the case reopened over two years ago. Somehow, we lost the file. Now we look like idiots. Attorney General sent me down here to try and get the original paperwork so we can fast-track this thing. Well, I sure hope we dotted our I's and and crossed our T's. So, Amelia Robbins... I remember this. Tragic. The girl was in the care of the State. Car slid off the road, went into the river. The driver was never found, but the girl washed up a couple miles away. The father I.D.'d the body? Well, he signed the official report, but the body was in bad shape. Match was made off dental records. See? 99% match. Doesn't get more ironclad than that, but I can see how a parent wouldn't want to believe it. Yeah. I'm gonna need a copy of the autopsy report. Take a minute. This is weird. What? The photos are gone. What photos? The autopsy, the body... everything. Hello. - Is this Frank Robbins? - Speaking. Mr. Robbins, my name is Martin Bohm. I'm sorry to disturb you like this, but I need to talk to you about your daughter, Amelia. What about her? I understand that you filed to have her death reinvestigated. It was her mother's doing. Why are you asking about my family for? Sir, I don't quite know how to say this, but I don't think you were wrong. She put you up to this? - Who? - My ex-wife. - No, I... - What are you, a private investigator? - No. - A psychic. - Listen, you're taking advantage of a distraught woman. - I'm not taking advantage of anybody. My daughter is dead! Never call here again. Hello? Damn it. Six **** Young**** I'm **** Why **** It **** I **** Tell **** Mrs.**** Words *** **** Is **** Yes. For **** **** I **** How **** It **** But **** Vice **** Please **** Excuse me. Have you always been a vulture, or is this a recent transformation? You're not here. Oh, yeah, I am, eBay. Don't call me that. Haven't you got anyplace else to be? No. Sorry, you're stuck with me. And I'm gonna fight you for every scrap that comes out of that ocean until you pack up your little tent of greed... What?! What are you doing? Hey! Wait! No, no! Put it down! Put it down! - Put it down! It's metal! - So? Did you ever hear of Fukushima? The tsunami caused a nuclear meltdown. Anything metal can be radioactive. Really? Really?You're that greedy that you'd risk getting cancer? Is that right? Okay, all righty. That thing could be killing you, but you don't care as long it's putting a few bucks in your pocket. Do you have any idea what it's like to lose something or someone? You have no shame, do you? I've got nothing but shame. You had quite the adventure, Jake. A trip to the police station? I'm just walking him back to his room. Please do. And then meet me in my office. - Who were those people in the rec room? - We can talk about that later. Did Mr. Bohm explain to you how Jake ended up in police custody? It wasn't as dramatic as all that. Jake dropped something out of the window and it landed on a police car. Yeah, well, it seems that every time Jake's with his father, something happens. He runs away. He climbs a cell tower. - He gets arrested? - Mr. Bohm is a good father. No, he's not. Not in my professional judgment. Not in the judgment of many of the assessors that have been reviewing Jake's case. When a child from this facility gets arrested with a parent, that triggers a response. What kind of response? Those people in the rec room-- are they here about Jake? Yes. - Did you inform his father? - We're not required to. Think very carefully what you're about to do. Because if you come down on the wrong side of this, your judgment will be called into question. - By you? - Yes, by me. You're ignoring the obvious dangers to Jake because you have an inappropriate relationship with his father. My relationship to Mr. Bohm is completely professional. Every action I have taken has been for Jake's well-being. Well, if that's true, you have a decision to make. No, no, no... You don't improve on perfection. Please, there is no perfection in this world. In the next, maybe, but here, we adapt, we grow. I'm sorry. Excuse me for the interruption. What was that? A problem has arisen. We were meeting to discuss. What kind of problem? The problem is you, Mr. Bohm. What to do about you. You recall our discussion of the 36? What does it have to do with me? The Kabala warns that the 36 must not become self-aware... but your son is. Jake has made you his instrument. This has never happened before. - And that's what your friends are afraid of? - Can you blame them? You are flying in the face of thousands of years of their belief, and your friend came here looking for another of the 36. Amelia. Many people believe connecting two of the Lamed-Vav could be dangerous. Me? I believe the whole thing to be outdated thinking. Mankind evolves. Sacred writings should evolve along with it. The world today is not what it was 4,000 years ago. So, you disagree with your colleagues. They're not pleased with me, but they're listening. Look, all I can tell you is Jake is leading me to Amelia. Earlier today, we were in a police station. I found her case file. If connecting with Amelia is dangerous, why would he do it? The simple answer is Jake obviously understands things which we cannot. I'm willing to have faith in him, which means I must have faith in you. You don't sound so sure about the second part. You came here for a reason. Please, how may I help you? Are you okay? I can't... Just breathe, all right? It's okay. It's all right. Tell me. Tell me what happened. I was there. The... the tsunami? You were there during the tsunami? In the flood? Yeah. I was, uh... I was in a mall. A mall. The water swept me over a railing. I was able to hold on. It was like a river rushing at you. But it had furniture in it, and... people. H-How long were you there for, holding on? Six... ...hours? Were you alone? There was, there was a woman there, holding on like me. You could tell she had a... she had a great deal of dignity, but this was not a dignified situation. And... We locked eyes at one point, and we just kept looking at each other, as if that would keep us safe. And... it worked? I could see in her eyes she was getting tired. The water kept bashing into us, and... it wouldn't let up! So I-I started talking to her. Even though I knew she couldn't understand me, I-I just started telling her about this guy at work who tells terrible jokes and eats everybody's food out of the fridge, and whatever else I could think of to keep her mind off the pain in her hands, and she was listening so intensely,and then there were tears in her eyes, and her fingers slipped, and she was gone. She was just... gone. I'm so sorry. I was rescued in an hour. And after a week, the Americans were evacuated and I was back in Seattle. In my apartment. As if nothing had ever happened. Stopped going to work, became obsessed with news of the survivors, and then I heard about the debris fields. I'm not selling this stuff! I'm putting it online hoping someone will claim it, hoping some of them are still alive. But so far... I don't know what I'm doing. I just know I have to. I don't expect you to understand. I... do understand. I understand completely.Okay? I'm going to help you. This is Arthur Teller. Subject Amelia Robbins, ten years old, non-verbal since birth. Amelia? May we start now? Your charts on weather, wind flow, dynamic energy conduction,they're quite impressive. - Anything useful? - No. All these discs are time-stamped before her supposed death. Patience, my friend. There are hundreds of boxes just like these awaiting your perusal. It may take a long time to sift through them all. Can you explain why the sequence begins with 318? Is there a significance to that number? She's so much like Jake. Her focus, obsessive behavior... She doesn't say a word. You're getting even faster at these. Very good, Amelia. - I see you're smiling.Is something amusing you? - The puzzle is a metaphor for itself. A-Amelia? I can't believe it. Amelia? Did she just...? - Could you say that again? - Maybe. This is extraordinary. Amelia, all these years, why haven't you spoken? Unnecessary. An evolutionary speed bump.Like your pinky toe. That's... that's very clever. Can you remember when you first became interested in weather maps? After the hospital. The hospital? Why were you there? Tests? Brain scans? Appendicitis. Six years old. It left a scar. Wait a second. Wait a second. - What-what is it? - Her autopsy report. Where is it? They removed, weighed, and replaced every organ in her body. Where is it? Come on... Appendix. 3.3 grams. She just said she had her appendix taken out. Whoever they buried, it couldn't have been Amelia. Now we can prove it. Thank you. Thank you! Yes. Yes, yes. Okay. Okay. Today **** Is **** this *** To **** I **** It **** And *** Do **** It's Martin. Call me back. I have proof that Amelia's still alive. We need to get Jake out of there, do you understand? Damn it. Welcome. Forgive **** You **** Mr **** Good afternoon. He said **** I'm sorry. Should **** Do **** This **** Here, let me take something for you. Thought you were worried about the metal stuff. I was just trying to scare you. I appreciate you doing this. But if you have somewhere to be... I don't. You keep checking that clock of yours. I'm meeting someone. But I got a little more time. Okay. I'll go back and get some more stuff. Hey, Wade? Wade, come here! Hurry! - What is it? - This sword! Look! This sword matches the sword stand on the news. I think this is their sword. See? That's her. Who? The woman holding on with me. She's alive. What happened? Where's the file? Where am I? Oh, no. No! No!No! No! No! - Drive. - What the hell? Drive! - What's going on? - Somebody just tried to have me killed. What? What happened? Do you honestly expect me to believe you didn't know? Of course not. You can't think that I would want to have you hurt. - Right now I don't know what to think. - Martin, I am on your side. Stop accusing me, and tell me what happened. Somebody knocked me out and left me for dead on the subway tracks-- I had the evidence I needed to get Jake out of that place, and now I don't. Somebody knows I'm looking, that I'm getting closer to the truth. - They must be following me. - I tried to warn you, you cannot win-- you have to let me help you. - You mean by signing Jake over to you. - I mean by keeping him safe. We both want the same thing-- you have to trust me. Just get me to Jake. I don't care what I have to do. He's out of that place today. I **** I want **** as **** As **** I **** laogong... Some **** What**** It??s **** He **** He **** Because **** I got the family's address from the news affiliate. The sword's gonna be shipped and in their hands in two days. That's so great. It's amazing how small the world is. Sure is. Is it time to meet your friend? I hope so. I've been waiting for a really long time to see her. Who is she? - Excuse me. - Yeah. - Frank? - You got to stop it, Lucy. I don't know who you're talking to, but you got to stop it. Wha-What are you talking about? I got a call today from some guy, said he thought that Amelia was still alive. Uh, uh, who? Who was it? What are you talking about? Lucy, Amelia's gone. No, listen to me, Frank. Today... th-the numbers sent me here. I listened to the numbers; I saw them, and they sent me right here, today. Don't tell me that you're standing on a beach somewhere waiting for her to appear. Oh, Lucy. You've got to stop this nonsense; do you hear me? - I can't... - Frank... That phone call today was the last straw. Frank, No, no, no. Listen! The numbers sent me here! Make it stop. Frank... - The numbers... - What happened? What happened? What happened? You okay? She's not coming. - Was that your friend? - It was my husband. My ex-husband. Our daughter... our daughter is missing, and he believes she's dead. But you don't? Amelia was obsessed with tides. She came up with this equation based on global tidal patterns, and-and-and... she was fixated on this certain sequence of numbers, and I... I know she was trying to tell us something. - Like what? - I don't know. But then after she went missing, I started trying to figure it out. I fed the sequence into the equation, and-and I came up with this date and this time and this set of coordinates that led me to this beach at this time on this day, and it's time's up and she's not here! She's not here, and I... I don't think she's ever gonna be here. She's never gonna be here. I'm crazy... Wait a minute. Lucy, come with me. It's okay, Lucy. It's okay. Come with me. Look. This is the current that normally hits this particular beach at this time of the year, - but the tsunami changed that. - What? The debris fields are so wide and long, they can change the flow of water. The current you're counting on is flowing farther south now. Here. You're not done. So you really think that's possible? What matters is... do you? Do you think she's alive? Look at me. Do you think she's alive? - Yes. - Then don't give up. Plot a new course. Come on. I'll help. Items that get caught in the gyre usually stay in the gyre, doomed to travel the same path, forever circulating the same waters. But not always. Their paths can be altered by a change in the weather, a storm at sea, a chance encounter with a pod of whales, which means it's possible to break free. Even after years of circling the same waters, it's possible to find a way to shore. - I want to see my son.] - Mr. Bohm, you look terrible. - Have you been in a fight? - You know exactly what's happened to me. I want to see Jake now! I don't think that's a good idea. Obviously, you're having some sort of breakdown. You can't stop me from seeing him. I have custody rights. Out of concern for your son's welfare, I filed a petition with the state calling for an emergency hearing. You no longer have custody of your son. We do. This is ridiculous. You don't hold a hearing without the child's family present. As you can see, all necessary parties were in attendance and in agreement. That's impossible. What about Clea Hopkins? Clea. My God, what have you done? I did what's best for Jake. We'll be in touch about an arranged visit. Jake? Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! You can't stop me from seeing my son! I haven't done anything wrong! Jake! Jake! Jake, I'm sorry! Touch Season 1 Episode 11
