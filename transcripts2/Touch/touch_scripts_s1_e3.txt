 *** living in the opical rain forests, and one of them,the red fire ant,lives underground, under constant threat of annihilation from flash floods. Nature doesn't care. If a species wants to survive,it has to prove it deserves to. When the floods come,the fire ants hold on to each other, creating a living raft that can float until thwater recedes. Months,if necessary. So how does a species figure something like that out? Instinct? Trial and error? Was there one fire ant who was being swept away by the rushing water...

 and grabbed on to another ant, only to find that together they could float? What if you were the one who knew what needed to be done... but you had no words? How do you make the others understand? How do you call for help? "Board & Care." Hello? Hello? Jake? Jake,is that you? Damn it! - Mr.Bohm? Is everything okay? - He called me. - Who? - Jake. I need to check on him.

 The kids are still asleep; are you sure it was Jake? Well,someone called me from this number,and when I answered they didn't say anything- sounds a lot like Jake to me. Look,there's no denying there's something amazing going on with your son... He's communicating with me-you saw it with your own eyes. You're right,I did-but we have to keep our feet on the ground here. You can't come running in at all hours,saying Jake sent you a message. I know it was him. Maybe so,but while he's being evaluated by Social Services... He doesn't need to be evaluated anymore. I'm his father; he's communicating with me. Through numbers. Do you know how that sounds to anyone but you or me? I don't care. Look,the State has a lot of power. I've seen them step in,and I don't want that to happen with Jake. So we just need to be careful. Fine. May I please see my son now? - Of course. - Thank you. Try not to wake him up. He's not here. Jake! Jake? Jake? Jake? Jake... Are you all right? Sweetheart,did you try and call me? 3287. Is that it? You can't keep jumping every time you think you hear him calling; it'll drive you crazy. He's trying to communicate with me,can't you see that? I need to take him back to his room. Jake... "3287." What the hell does that mean? -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- -=http://ytet.org=- proudly presents -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- Sync:?۷?  Touch Season 01 Episode 03 3287. What does it mean? Well,according to Jake's caseworker, the number isn't what's significant, it's the fact that I keep chasing them down. Yeah,you have no choice. So that's it?From here on in, - my life is just gonna be running down random numbers for Jake? - No,they're not random. Well,if I ignored the numbers? Can I ignore the numbers? You can do whatever you want. But it seems pretty clear that bad things will happen,not to mention what it does to Jake. Jake's pain. Those numbers point to a disorder in the universe. Jake feels the pain of people attached to those numbers. And until things get right,he suffers. So I can ignore the numbers,but my son will be in pain. That's not a choice. Child Services is doing an assessment on Jake. They're doing one on me,too. If I keep chasing down these numbers, they're gonna take him away from me. - Maybe I should go check it out. - No,no,please. Thank you. They think I'm crazy enough. I... I'd be... I'm sorry,I just mean that I think I should fly under the radar. You need to keep your eyes open. Your son has a higher purpose, and believe me,you won't be the only one who notices it. "3287." *********** - How did it go,Grace? - I hope to get a job,Baruti. I think you will. I only wish I could say the same for your friend,Sauda. Grace.

It's weird,huh? I'm the only one in a dress. - Ticket? - Um,I should've worn shorts. - Have a great time. - Can I ask you a question? - Is it about the dress? - No. Um,I'm supposed to meet someone outside of a tent where they're holding a dance competition.

Look,look,look,look. Look,see. Look,it's mine,it's mine. This book is just like my son's book. Who are you? I'm the Invisible Prince. That's my ledger,and I'm late for my rounds. - What? - My rounds,my rounds. It's my job to keep them safe. They're all connected through me in there. We have to go right now; I can feel it. I only have 14 minutes. The thread is tight; there's no time. You can come with me,but we have to leave right now. This number,3287,what does it mean? It means the Dragon is loose. We have to stop it. The Dragon. Wait! Wait. Wait,please. Please! My son,he has a book just like yours,full of numbers. He-he sees patterns in the numbers,messages. Is that what you see? Yes. When did it start? When you were a child? My-my son is ten. Uh,thread... the thread is pulled very tight. I can feel it. - Wh-What? - I have to go. I have to go! Jake,I need you to point to the animal that makes this sound: Moo. Jake,I need your attention. Can you look at me,please? You really like that car,huh? Can I see it? See the car,Jake?

If I'm not there... I'm late. What was too close? - 2873287 - What did I miss? 3287 3287 3287 The number that you keep... Look at me. The number that you keep saying,3287,look. My son gave me this. 3287 I think he sees what you see, and I think he wants me to help you somehow. He wants you to stop the pain. What? Wait. ********** Who lives here? Wait,please,please. Tell me about the Dragon. I tried to kill it,but I failed. What? How? I had a magic sword. The only sword powerful enough to slay the Dragon. I offered it to the King,but he thought it was a trick. He buried it deep within the Mountain of Clare,behind a wall of stones. Well,can't you get it back? You don't know much about magic swords,do you? I can't en touch it. What are we doing here? - The final battle is tonight. - The final battle? Look,you're gonna have to give me more information if you want me to help you. So far all we've done today is pick flowers and watch people go about their business. Wait a second. That woman's from... You pressed the walk button so she could cross the street. Now she's here,too. Now they're together. Why? What's gonna happen? The Dragon. Excuse me,are your chairs empty? I'm sorry? Are you waiting for someone or are you alone? No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no! I'm sorry,it's not your fault; please sit. I'm,um,I'm just t gonna be the best company. Why are you sad? He stood me up. I've been stood up. I'm sitting here,stood up. I'm such an idiot. he ************ I've never done anything like this before. I've never traveled hundreds of miles for someone that I met online, but he seemed so perfect, and he was really ready to take a chance,you know? I should have known. Girl power! Strawberry martinis! The main stage show featuring the Morticians starts in 15 minutes. If you're here for the Morticians, make your way to the main stage. - Morticians! - Morticians! I think I'm gonna stay here for a little bit longer. Thank you. girl ******* Hey,is this your phone? Ladies and gentlemen,the song stylings of the next global phenom,Kayla Graham. Play it forward,pass it along. Start your fan clubs here. You okay? - I'm voting to settle. - No. I've lost my house,my savings. I'm working two jobs. If they'll give me 20 cents on the dollar,I'll take it. We have to hang together. If one of us falls,we all lose. We can't prove anything. Without proof,we're just people that made a bad investment. Besides,no one's heard from Roger King's representatives in months. They could be cutting a deal behindur back right now. We can't worry about Roger King. We have until 6:00 tonight. Let's see what they have to offer us. Please. - Are you one of the plaintiffs? - no,but... Are you representing one of the plaintiffs? Yes. Uh,Roger King. Thank you. I thought no press was allowed. This is Martin Bohm. He's a reporter. Excuse me. Rush. Rush Middleton. You remembered? All this time,I thought you only knew me as Get Me Some Coffee or You're Fired. Look,this is my story. I've been following it for three years, and I'm not going to let you scoop me at the finish line. I've got exclusivity with all but one of the plaintiffs. As soon as they vote to settle,I run my story. So,I'm guessing you didn't get Roger King to talk? Right. Well,I can't be expected to do the impossible. Just because you couldn't do it,doesn't make it impossible. You think you can get Roger King to talk? It's worth a shot. I'd love to see you try. You need his address? Phone number? I'll make you a deal. Get Roger King to talk,and I'll share my byline with you at The Herald. You'd like that,ight? Another shot at the big leagues? Only this time,of course,you may be getting coffee for me. I'll let you know what he says. "3287." Roger King. The ng? Sheri,what can you tell me about the patient on B wing? - What patient? - In room six. Midway down the hall. Jake keeps going AWOL and ending up there. I'm wondering who's inside. No one. The room's empty. Then why...? Mom? Yes. I'm Clea Hopkins. Oh,my God. Oh,okay. I'll-I'll be right there. - Yes? - My name is Martin Bohm. I need to speak to Roger King,please. Roger King is dead. This is his son Charlie. What is this regarding? The class-action suit against Morton-Starling. I don't want anything to do with that. Mr.King... look... I'm terribly sorry about anything that you might have gone through,but I need... Truth is,I - I don't even know what I need, but I know was meant to come here... I'm sorry,I can't help you. ****** The Claremont. The Mountain of Clare. Stone walls. Look,if I have to call the police,I will... Do you know anything about The Invisible Prince? The Invisible Prince was a character in a bedtime story that my father used to tell my brother Walt and me. The Invisible Prince did good deeds in secret. Otherwise,they wouldn't count. Tell me about your brother. He w a genius with numbers. He was just a shy little kid, but he grew up to be an accountant with Morton-Starling, and eventually developed a financial product that made that company billions. I - I didn't understand it. I'm not a numbers guy. Do you have any records from this time? Press clippings,anything? I threw all that stuff out. You can get it all it online. Just search,"Morton-Starling," "fraud." Can we do that here? Now? I need the computer,Matt. Dad,no. I'm about to play a guy in California. It's a game,Matt. Let's log out now. Looks like the Dominator bailed. 4SOWETO moves up a spot. hurry. we're ******** you ****** i am ******* you're *********** you're here. The Beastmaster is unstoppable! Only 4SOWETO left to go, and the Beastmaster will once again be the undisputed champion. 4SOWETO,you are up in two minutes. you ******* {\a6}*********** Walt saw investors making money,so he convinced my father to invest his savings. He convinced other family members,neighbors. What happened? The firm exploited a loophole in the contract which allowed them to bilk investors for millions. My father lost everything, except for this apartment,which I was able to buy. He went into a deep depression,stop talking, and one day,his heart stopped. That's when my brother disappeared. I thought he might be dead until you showed up. Your brother's very much alive, and I think he's trying to make up for everything that happened. Look,if we're gonna help him, we need to do it by 6:00 before the plaintiffs are forced to settle. It's only an hour from now. Your brother Walter said that he gave the King a sword to slay the Dragon. Do you have any idea what that could mean? It's from the bedtime story. It's the magic sword of truth. The truth. Sword of truth. Did Walter give anything to his father before he died? My father refused to speak to my brother before he died. And all he left behind was a couple of boxes. Can I see those,please? Well,the woman we admitted has been living under a bridge. Does your mother have a history of mental illness? She's schizophrenic. - Is she on medication? - I really don't know. Uh,I got a call on my cell phone a couple days ago, but before that,I hadn't heard from her in six years. How badly is she hurt? She sustained a head injury when she got hit by the car. - There is swelling on the brain... - Was it near Queensboro Plaza? Where she was hit - was it near the train tracks at Queensboro Plaza? Yes. How did you know that? She used to take me there to wait for the train. When it passed,she would scream at the top of her lungs into the sound of the train. Scared the hell out of me. - I'm sorry. - Not at all. This is ur mother we're talking about. Are you ready? That's not my mother. What? But her cell phone... Look,your number was the last one dialed. Maybe it was stolen. I'm so sorry. Ah,excuse me,sir. My name is Dr.Arthur Tell.er I'd like to speak to the director of the facility. Sure,Doctor. One second. Arthur? Sheri Strepling? You're the director here? For three years. - How can I Ip you,Arthur? - Well,I was hoping for a tour. Yeah,I'm consulting on a case, and I thought this might be a-a good place for my patient. You mind showing me around? Sure. I'll give you a quick tour. I didn't kw my father had one of those. It's locked. I have no idea what the combination is. I think I might. - It's never been opened. - Open it. What is it? The Magic Sword of Truth. I got 17 minutes to go 22 blocks. This is the rec room where we see most of our patients. AnI'm afraid this is where the tour must end. Why are you here,Arthur? I told you,I have a patient. I don't know why you would want another patient after everything that happened. I stand by my research,Sheri... I'm sorry. Excuse me. Jake? ******** Jake,Jake,can you hear me? get ********* stop ************ Jake,are you in pain? And here they come,all the way from South Africa,4Soweto! They're loving 4Soweto! The Beastmaster's gonna get beat! Whatever you wrote,delete it. You're starting over. You shouldn't be in here,Martin. Security'll throw you out. Rush,shut up,please. Just read. That's the smoking gun. Morton-Starling intentionally cheated their investors. Walter King wrote those memos. He created the financial scheme that allowed Morton-Starling to cheat their investors. "anomaly in tax code leaves open the possibility of fraud"? He's trying to show them the flaws in his design. He's telling them not to use it. But instead the company exploited a loophole and made millions. - Why would you give this to me? - Same reason I chose you to get my coffee. I always thought you were gonna be a great reporter. I'll see what I can do about the byline. No,no,this is yours - it'll be our little secret, otherwise it doesn't count. This is Rush Middleton. I need to speak to the attorney representing the plaintiffs against Morton-Starling. What's,uh... what's so funny? a girl doing cartwheels in front of her dog. It's the look on the dog's face. Come check it out. Yeah,that's... that's pretty funny. You're not laughing. Well,nothing's gonna make me laugh today. That's how I felt until I started looking through this thing. There are videos on here from all around the world. Wait,this is not your phone? No. But I think that's the point. You're supposed to upload a video,like a message to the world,and then pass it on. You can say something. Oh,no. I just... I just had the worst day of my life. For what it's worth,I thought you were amazing. I lost to a ten-year-old. He was really cute. Did the Dragon win? The Dragon is dead. It's already online. The plaintiffs refused to settle. They're gonna take these guys to court to make sure they can't cheat anyone else. We did it. We found the sword,slew the Dragon and saved the people. - Kneel,please. - Kneel? Please? In honor of your service and the completion of your quest, you will now be known as the Invisible Knight. Thank you. That means a lot to me. And to your son... the pain is gone. You know,now that things have been put right, you don't have to be invisible anymore. I have to go. I don't want to be late for my rounds. Wait,please. In case you change your mind, there's a family behind the stone walls at the Mountain of Clare. They would love to see you again. And they wanted me to tell you that you are welcome anytime. Human beings are not the strongest species on the planet. We're not the fastest,or maybe even the smartest. The one advantage we have is our ability to cooperate... to help each other out. Today,Main Street reigned over Wall Street after victory came to the plaintiffs in the Morton-Starling fraud suit. The financial giant was unable to settle... We recognize ourlves in each other, and are programmed for compassion, for heroism,for love. And those things make us stronger,faster. and smarter. It's why we've survived. It's why we even want to. Come in. Sorry to interrupt,but I thought Jake might want this back. Found it in the middle of the hallway. You give it to him. What I said this morning about not jumping every time Jake calls... I know... those patterns aren't so easy to break. You love him and you want him to be okay. Yeah. I'm learning,too. I'll try to be a little more understanding going forward. Thank you. Once upon a time,there was an Invisible Knight who served the Silent King, and together they helped people that didn't even know they were there. -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- -=http://ytet.org=- proudly presents -=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=- Sync:?۷?Ҫ??Ѫ??
