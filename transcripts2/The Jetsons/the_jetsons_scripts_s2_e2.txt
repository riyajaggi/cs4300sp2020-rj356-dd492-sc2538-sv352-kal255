 Looks like your room needs a good dusting, Roy boy. Sure thing, Rosie. But watch out for my scale model of the Titan Trade Towers. ASTRO: Ow! Oops. My peripheral location sensors didn't detect you, Astro. Uh-oh. Gee, my rear sensors must need eye drops. Sorry, Roy boy. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Gee, don't blow a circuit, Rosie. Maybe my intergalactic-architecture

 teacher won't notice that I'm 500 floors short. Did you have a good day, dear? That depends. Is the car still in one piece? Oh, relax, Daddy. Rosie's teaching me to drive, not Mom. Ah. I never have to worry with Rosie around. Sorry, the house isn't prepped up, Mr. J. Don't apologize, Rosie, and don't mind me. I'm just gonna slip into my old slippers and relax. Rosie, have you seen my slippers? You shouldn't leave things lying around, Mr. J. They can really clog up my computerized canister. But they've been under this chair for 20 years.

 It took me that long to break them in. There, there. Accidents do happen, dear. Besides, it's about time you invested in a new pair anyway. It's about time I started dinner. [DOORBELL RINGING] After I get the front door. [GIGGLING] Oh, gosh, how robotically romantic, Rosie. Mac's brought you high-intensity ultra-violets. He ought to know better than to bother me at dinnertime. Get lost. [CRYING] I don't get it, Rosie. You always said Henry Orbit's robot was the spaciest. Yeah, the spaciest. As Miss Judy would say, I'm totally up-fed with him bugging me. You mean fed up, Rosie. You said it. [METAL CRASHING] Didn't Rosie like the flowers, Mac? [CRYING] Don't cry, you'll short circuit. Now, tell Henry all about it. Let me serve your favorite dish. Ooba-dooba, solara souffle. But it doesn't look, smell... ...or taste like solara souffle. That's because it's Venusian vegetable delight. Venusian delight? I hate that dish more than anything in the universe. Yuck. My mother used to make me eat that when I was a kid. Here, Astro. No, way. -Seconds, Mr. J? -Rosie, are you out to lunch? This stuff is my least favorite dish. Then why did you order it? Has Rosie totally flipped her microchips? ELROY: Well, something's wrong. She's pre-programmed to know we can't stand this galactic glop. I'm gonna have a man-to-robot talk with Rosie. JANE: Wait, George. You know how sensitive she is. But what about me? Hey, Henry Orbit knows all about robots, Dad. For sure. He even built one. Good thinking, kids. I'll go right to the source. I was on my way to see you, Mr. Jetson... ...about the way Rosie's been treating my Mac. Well, that's the way she's been treating everyone. It doesn't take a high-priced robotologist to know... ...that her microchip master cylinder is malfunctioning. Ah. Here it is. Rosie's owner-manual disk. MAN [OVER RECORDING]:The Mechano Maid microchip master cylinder must be replaced every five years... ...25,000 miles or 50,000 meals, whichever comes first. Ooba-dooba, if that's all it needs I'll go right up and check. Hold your lift-off just a parsec, Mr. Jetson. It's not polite to ask a woman her age. Just be tactful. Sneak a peak at Rosie's odometer late tonight... ...when she's off-line. Looking for a midnight snack, Mr. J? Uh... - Well-- - I got just what you need. Some leftover Venusian delight. George, how could it take you 30 minutes to check Rosie's odometer? Oh, 15 minutes eating cold Venusian delight... ...10 putting Rosie to sleep... ...and five to find out she's 35,000 miles overdue... ...for replacing her microchip master cylinder. Poor dear. Yeah, I hope these Andromeda antacids help. I meant Rosie, George. We've got to get her the new part in the morning. If I live that long. MAN: Yessiree, George, you were smart to come to Robot City. We've got more parts than the Milky Way has stars. Great. We just need one. A new microchip master cylinder for our robot housekeeper. No problem. Model number? She's an XB-500. Madame, are you an antique dealer? That model is so old the manual alone has become a collector's item. ROSIE: Sorry to bother you Mr. Spacely but Mr. J forgot his lunch. Your Mr. J hasn't even come in yet. And if you find him, please relay the message. He's late. Oh, dear, he should've been here by now. Maybe there's been an accident. Ow! There just was. ROSIE: Flyways are always bumper to bumper in the morning. Maybe the car's solar engine has overheated. The Jetsons could be in trouble. I'll use my employer-locator sensor to find them. Why not at least consider one of our new generation of robot maids? - Yi-- - The Mechano Maid 2000. As you've already noticed, it has hyperdrive hover feet to ensure totally silent operation. No clanking wheels... ...and best of all, she's user-friendly. MAID: Pleased to meet you. Charmed. But we really only want a new master cylinder. Not a new robot. That's Mr. J's car. But what is he doing at a robot shopping center? As you can see, the Mechano Maid 2000... ...is more economical, efficient and four times as fast as Rosie. I can't believe my circuits. The Jetsons want to replace me. My head is spinning-- Is spinning-- Is spinning-- Is spinning. Well, she's certainly impressive, but we-- I know. You're concerned about cost. Don't worry. I'll be happy to take your current robot as a down payment. [GASPS] After all I've done for them. They wanna trade me in. Just because he left his slippers where I could trip over them. And he didn't like his dinner, even though it was his favorite. Why didn't Mrs. J say they were unhappy with me? Woman to woman. [CRYING] Now listen here, we've seen enough. Rosie is like one of the family to us. We don't want a new robot. We just want Rosie back to normal. That goes double for me. If you don't wanna sell us a master cylinder... ...we'll just take our business elsewhere. ROSIE: They didn't even give me a month's notice. If I put my circuits in overdrive... ...maybe I can be out of here before they fire me. I guess this is goodbye. Goodbye? How come? [CRYING] Don't overflow your tear circuits, Astro. This note will explain. Can't read. Maybe we'll meet again sometime. SPACELY: Jetson, you're two hours late. I can explain everything, Mr. Spacely. See, I've been having some trouble with my maid. So have I, Jetson. She ran over my foot. Sorry, sir, but she won't do it again. My wife's on her way home with Rosie's new part. George, come home quick. - Rosie's quit. - Quit? But why? She said she didn't want us to fire her. - I'm on my way. - But, Jetson, you just got here. A Mechano Maid with my experience should have no trouble getting a new job. Sorry, honey. Nobody is hiring old models like you these days. But-- ROBOT: Sorry, sweetheart, can't use you. In fact, I got 20 more of you stacked up in the basement... ...gathering moon dust. I understand. Thanks anyway. MAN [ON TV]:Spacecraft warnings are out due to scattered meteor showers in the Milky Way region, while locally an electrical storm front will be moving in. Uh-oh. I better find a room for the night. Oh, my. Rooms are as hard to find as jobs. [THUNDER CRASHING] Sure is tough for a robot in the humans' world. The Jetsons always took care of me. Now I have to take care of myself. [SNEEZING] I've tried all her favorite haunts... ...the Lubra Coffee Shop, the Beta Bingo Parlor... ...even checked all the robot singles bars along the Galaxy Strip. No Rosie. Why don't you swing by and pick me up, George? There must be something we haven't thought of. HENRY: Come on, Mac, we're all worried. But rusting there won't bring her back any faster. Gee, Dad... ...I miss Rosie. - Why did she run away? - It's all my fault. I never should have lost my temper about that horrible dinner she made. JANE: Dinner's coming right up. Oh, I've forgotten how hard it was to cook. Oh, these radar ribs are a little tough, Jane. Rosie always helped me with my homework tapes. Now who's gonna do it? And who will give me my driving lessons? You could ask us. We're your parents. It's not the same thing, Mom. Rosie is special. Yes, special. Yeah, very special. She certainly is. We'll just have to keep looking until we find her. I hope she changes her mind and comes back. [BOY LAUGHING] BOY: This is supersonic fun. Look at it go. Roy boy? Here, Roy. Correction. Here's your space glider, young man. Young man, young man, young man. Gee, thanks. What's past is past. Time to make a new start, Rosie girl. Look. There she is. Rosie. Sorry, wrong robot. More coffee? More coffee? More coffee? More coffee? No job. No place to rest my weary circuits. HENRY: No, Mac, you cannot go out looking for Rosie again. I need your help around here. Transporter tube in Apartment 2308 is on the fritz. And besides, it's been two weeks now... ...and even the Jetsons have stopped searching. [WHIMPERING] I'm afraid she's not coming back. With a little luck, she's probably got herself another job anyway. That's it, Rosie girl. Make it shine, make it shine, make it shine. Uh-oh. Just can't seem to do anything right. GEORGE: Don't be so nervous, Judy. Driving a car is as easy as going to the moon. Watch out on the right. Don't follow so close. You're going too fast. No, don't slow up. Daddy, you're making me a wreck. Better you than the car. Shove over. I'm taking the stick. See, Judy? Nothing to it. I wish Rosie were here. Me too. Well, well, Mr. Jetson. How's your old robot getting along? She's not. Rolled out on us weeks ago. Nothing's been the same since. Gee, that's too bad. But you're in luck. Have I got a deal for you. Astro, have you seen Orbitty? Since Rosie's been gone, I can't find anything in my room. Hi, Elroy. JANE: Elroy, help. I must have overloaded the thermal-wave washing machine. Dad, what in the galaxy is that? MAID: Mechano Maid 2000 at your service. George, how could you? We can never replace Rosie. It looks as if you could use some help. MAID: Affirmative. I'll reprogram the washer's solar cycle immediately. Not bad, huh? Try her out for seven days. Absolutely free. You'll wonder how you ever did without her. I wonder if we'll ever see Rosie again. MAN: You do windows? ROSIE: I never have. But I'm willing to try. A-okay. Take her up, and remember, no glitches. I'll be monitoring your performance. Spray and wipe. Spray and wipe. Spray and-- Wipe. Clumsy clunker. What's wrong with your peripheral sensors? You're fired. Turn in your hard hat. [CRYING] ANNOUNCER [ON TV] Two outs, bases loaded bottom of the ninth inning. And Johnny Omega is jetting up to the plate. Ooba-dooba. Go, Johnny, go. Go, Johnny, go. Yeah, hit one out of the ballpark. Hey, what in the cosmos do you think you're doing? I am preprogrammed to monitor solar watt usage for optimum efficiency. In short, I am saving you money. Now, listen here. I don't wanna save energy. I wanna watch the game. Too bad. You are all allowed 10 minutes of hologram TV per night. And your time is up. - And so is yours. [ASTRO] - Help. Hey, where are you going with my dog? It is unsanitary to have animals... ...in the habitation for more than two hours a day. Especially, animals with a high flea count. Why, you digital dictator. We ought to put you off-line. Impossible. I am equipped with gamma backup generators. I am now terminating your apartment energy usage... ...for the evening. See you in the morning. You're a mess. You could use a nice hot cup of cosmic oil. But where's your job? Your money? The Jetsons have forgotten all about you by now. Happy with their nice new-model maid. GEORGE: Hey, 2000, where's my lunch? You don't need it, Jetson. You appear to be getting a little paunchy. Paunchy? Me? And you're late for work. You're going to be late for your driving test, young lady. I can't take it, Mom. I'll never pass. I'm just not good enough. Rosie thought you were. She wouldn't want you to quit. Come on, do it for Rosie. She had faith in you. You're right, she did. And wherever she is... ...I won't let her down. MAN: You're doing very well, Ms. Jetson. Signal for a right-hand turn at the next hoverpass. Excellent. Who taught you how to drive, Ms. Jetson? JUDY: Our housekeeper, Rosie. Rosie. It can't be. Please, Ms. Jetson. Keep your eye on the road. But that looked like Rosie. It looked more like a stop satellite, and you just ran it. - Minus 25 points. - I don't care. I've got to see if that's Rosie. INSTRUCTOR: Illegal U-turn. Minus another 25 points. [INSTRUCTOR SCREAMS] That's 50 points for making a power dive... ...without a hand signal. You've failed the test. But I found Rosie. Miss Judy. Is that really you? Oh, yes, Rosie. Come on, Rosie, get in. I'll drive you home. You're not driving anyone home. You don't have a license. And you're not getting one, either. Here, then you drive. Are you kidding? It's a flying jungle out there, I should know. I gave half of those crazy jet jockeys their licenses. I'll be more than happy to drive, to drive, to drive. No way. Get us out of here, Miss Jetson. But you said I don't have my-- Here. You just got your license. On one condition. Drop me at the next corner. Oh, everyone's gonna flip their orbit when they see you, Rosie. We've all missed you so much. MAID: Jetson residence. Who or what should I say is calling? You didn't miss me at all. You replaced me just the way I calculated. [CRYING] Rosie, wait. We-- You don't understand. Mom, help. Help what, dear? I found Rosie. But when she saw this, she left. That transistorized transient was my predecessor? Oh, button your microchip. -Yeah. - Yeah. Jumping Jupiter. Is there an evacuation? ELROY: It's Rosie, Dad. She's come back. JUDY: And run away again. Jetsons don't want me. Can't blame them. I'm no good to anybody. I malfunction all the time. All the time. Nobody cares. No place to go. No point in keeping my circuits opened. I'll be more useful as scrap metal. Any sign of her, Orbitty? Not yet. Hey, there she is. Rosie, wait. JUDY: Oh, no. We're too late. Hang on, Rosie. We'll get you out. Hang on, Rosie. [GRUNTING] Hurry, hurry. I can't hold on any longer. Oh, Rosie. Why did you ever leave us in the first place? Why pretend, Mrs. J? I saw you both in Robot City... ...looking at that new-model maid. The one you bought to replace me. Rosie, don't sizzle your circuits. I can explain everything. All done, Rosie. With this new master cylinder... ...you're good as new. Thanks, Mr. O. And you too, Mac. But I've got some unfinished business to attend to. Oh, put me down, you obsolete relic. I insist. Well, if you insist. Wow, Rosie's stronger than ever. How about some dinner, folks? Maybe a little Venusian delight? Right. - Huh? - Just kidding, Mr. J. [LAUGHING] See? I got my sense of humor back. Oh, Rosie, we're just in orbit having you back.
