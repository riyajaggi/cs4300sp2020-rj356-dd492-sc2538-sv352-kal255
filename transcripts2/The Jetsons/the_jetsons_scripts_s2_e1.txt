 SINGERS: Meet George Jetson His boy, Elroy Daughter, Judy Jane, his wife Come, children, it's time to leave. Hi, teach. I got some terrific holographs of our field trip. Oh, that's fine, Orville. Now take your seat, please. I'm gonna keep this meteorite for a paperweight. Can I take back a sample of plant life for show and tell? I don't see why not. But hurry along, we're blasting off soon.

 Did you hear that? Let's get going. Now, is anyone missing? Elroy Jetson. Sometimes that boy makes me wish... ...I'd been programmed as a computerized dishwasher. CAMERA: Elroy? Elroy Jetson? Boy, what a swell-looking rock. I'll add it to my collection. Gee, and I thought I had a good grip on it. Elroy Jetson, I've been looking all over this asteroid for you. I found a weird-looking rock under that boulder over there. CAMERA: And just look how dirty your spacesuit is. ELROY: You sound like my mom. [ROCK SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]

 Do we have to go? It would have been the best specimen in my whole collection. We've got to get back to the school shuttle. Hey, how did the rock get in here? Isn't it the spaciest? All I know is we're late, young man and we won't get back before your bedtime. Wait till Dad sees this. He'll be proud of me. JANE: Oh, good. It's almost time for theEdge of Space program. We can watch it on our new 3-D TV holographic set. Ah, okay, but I wanted to watch the spaceball game. Your eyes burn like two Martian moons. Oh, Jeffrey, my darling. Oh, Jennifer, my celestial star. Oh, my aching back. Can't we switch to the spaceball game for a second? Spaceball? Really, sir. This is a very dramatic scene. Uh, sorry. He's going to propose to Jennifer. Now be quiet. Mother, will you just look at my hair? It's a mess. Why, Judy, it looks, uh, quite different. My Stellar Styler broke down. I dialed up a simple spiral nebula twist and look what it did. [CRYING] If I have to go to school like this tomorrow, I'll just die. Maybe your father can fix it for you. ANNOUNCER [OVER TV]:Now batting for the Chicago Comets is Joey Jupiter. Hey, knock it out of the solar system, Joey. ANNOUNCER: Here's the pitch. JANE: George. George Jetson. Yes, dear? Yowch. George, what happened to my soap opera? Sorry, Jane, I'll switch it back again. Uh-oh. The programs are mixed together. - Why, you're not Jeffrey. - And you're not the umpire. Ah, I'll have to get the TV fixed tomorrow. ROSIE: Mr. and Mrs. J. Look who the school shuttle just dropped off. [ROCK SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] Huh? What's that? JANE: I think it's time our little explorer went to bed. Mom, Dad. Oh, wait till I tell you what I found on the asteroid. GEORGE: You can tell us all about it in the morning, son. JANE: I'll tuck him into bed, Rosie. ROSIE: Yes, ma'am. Hey, maybe this thing has cleared up by itself. - Oh, Jennifer. - Oh, Joey. [GASPS] We're being watched. Hey, buddy, we'd like a little privacy here, okay? Oh. Heh, heh, heh. Sorry. What would you like to dream about tonight, Elroy? Jungle hunter, super sport star or rocket ranger? ELROY: Rocket ranger. [MACHINE PLAYING LULLABY MUSIC] Sleep tight, Elroy. Good evening, rocket ranger. Tonight, your mission is to battle the gas blobs of Beta 3. Huh? What was that? MAN [ON MONITOR]: Look out, rocket ranger. There's a swarm of deadly bees on your right. ELROY: Astro, I thought you were a swarm of deadly bees. Do you wanna wake Mom and Dad up? - Sorry. - I know you're sorry. Bu-- But what's wrong with you? Look up there. ELROY: That's my rock. How did it get way up there? Look, it's breaking apart. [BABBLES] Hello. Aah! Hey, what are you two doing? That wasn't a rock I picked up on the asteroid, was it? It was an egg. You were inside an egg. Jumping Jupiter, this is even better than I thought. [GROWLING] [ORBITTY SCREAMS] ELROY: Astro, stop that. You go sleep in the kitchen tonight. [ASTRO WHIMPERING] You can come down now. Astro won't hurt you. My name is Elroy. Do you have a name? Yes. My name Orbitty. - You're an Orbitty? - Uh-huh. Well, welcome to Earth. [WHIMPERING] Wow. Just wait till I show you off tomorrow morning. Now, don't go away. [GROANING] - Good night, Orbitty. - Good night, Elroy. Boy, oh, boy, I'm a mess this morning. I shouldn't have eaten that pizza in bed. This will put this grooming gizmo to the test. Elroy, did you tinker with my autobarber grooming gizmo? Thanks for fixing my Stellar Styler last night, Daddy. It's working better than ever now. I didn't do anything to it last night. Something weird is going on here. Judy's hairdresser gets fixed overnight... ...and someone's been fooling around with my autobarber. And I'll bet that someone is Elroy. Daddy, what is that thing? Whatever it is, I'll protect you. Whatever you are, get out of my house. [PURRING] Oh, no, you don't. Is that you, George? Can't talk now, honey. I'm saving you from a monster. That's thoughtful of you, dear. I didn't know Mr. J took up jogging. All right, you, when I say out, I mean out. You're looking good, Mr. J. Did you get rid of it, Daddy? Astro-- [SPEAKING IN MUFFLED VOICE] Goodness me, what a noisy household this morning. Funny, I don't remember having a dust rag this color. Hello. Ew. - Quick, Astro, attack. - Attack? There's some kind of monster loose in this house. Monster? Ha. Some guard dog you turned out to be. What's going on out here? Mother, there's some horrible monster in the house. And it's got hold of Elroy. Hey, how's a kid supposed to get his sleep with all this racket out here? Be brave, Elroy. I'll rush the monster, and you run for safety. [GROWLS] You mean Orbitty? He's no monster. He's a friend of mine. Yeah, friend. F-- Friend? Where did he come from? He hatched in my room last night. Oh, sure, he hatched. He hatched? It was inside an egg that I picked up by mistake on an asteroid. All this is too much for me this early in the morning. What next? [WOOD CREAKING] [GLASS CRASHING] Oh, why can't we have normal problems like everyone else? Let's see, D, E.... Ah, here we are. ENCYCLOPEDIA: MicroEncyclopedia, volume O, at your service. Okay. Show me what you know about a creature named Orbitty. ENCYCLOPEDIA: I have a fascinating article on outer-space owls, if you'd be interested. Maybe next time. Orbitty, please. I can't stand a know-it-all encyclopedia. ENCYCLOPEDIA: How about ogres? GEORGE: Ostriches? No, no, pay attention. I said Orbitty. ENCYCLOPEDIA: Can I help it if you mumble? Orbitty. A rare, endangered, asteroid animal. It moves by using spring-loaded legs and suction-cup feet. That I already know. ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ahem. If I may continue? Changes color to express its emotions. Considered friendly, helpful and polite. Last reported sighting, 650 years ago. Genus: Statelitus craterus orbitus. JUDY: Daddy. That little purple thing is taking our 3-D TV apart in the living room. Oh, no. I'll stop it. All right, where did you go? Endangered species or not, if you damaged my TV, I'll... ANNOUNCER [ON TV]:And now Splash Crater will attempt a triple somersault... ...into the Seven Pools of Pluto swim stadium. What do you know? That little Orbitty thing did fix the TV. Orbitty must have worked on Judy's hairstyler last night... ...and my autobarber this morning. ELROY: Ha, ha. Boy, this is fun. Whee! Ha, ha. Elroy, wanna play catch? Play catch? Well, sure, Astro. Catch. That was terrific, Orbitty. Can you do that again? [WHIMPERING] - What's for lunch, Jane? - It's been a hectic morning. ...I only had time to prepare a few sandwiches and things. GEORGE: Oh, sounds good to me. I'm starved. Ah. This is good for a start, Jane. Dig in, gang. Dad, Orbitty hasn't eaten a thing since he hatched. He must be hungry. Don't worry about him. Did you feed Astro yet? ELROY: Yeah. I just put out his Dino Delta Dog Chow. GEORGE: I wonder what that thing does eat? [ORBITTY PURRS] Yummy, yummy, yum. Hey, Astro, uh, do you want some table scraps? Scraps? Mm-hm. All gone? Well, you shouldn't gulp down your food so fast. [ORBITTY WHISTLES] You want any of this, Orbitty? [GROWLING] [SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] Isn't he cute? JANE: He's adorable. ELROY: And I found him. [JETSONS LAUGHING] JUDY: Oh, look at him. [GROANS] [GROWLS] Can Orbitty stay with us, Dad? I don't know, son. He's an alien creature... ...and should go back home to be with his own family. But if he's an endangered species... ...maybe there aren't any others on that asteroid... ...and he'd be all alone. GEORGE: Let's sleep on it tonight, okay? [PURRING] [ELROY GIGGLES] Goodbye, everyone. Astro, where you going? Where do you think he went, Dad? Don't worry, Elroy. Astro is one dog who can take care of himself. DOGCATCHER: You're a heavy one, ain't you, Rover? - Astro, my name's Astro. - Whatever. Maxie, this is Felix. I found another one without a licensed collar. I'm bringing him in. Elroy! [CRYING] Now, Elroy, don't worry. I'm sure Astro just went out for a walk or something. - But I just gotta find him, Dad. - Not tonight. We'll go out first thing in the morning, okay? Ah, Dad. That's final, Elroy. Now go to sleep, will you? Orbitty, why did Astro run away like that? [SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] He was jealous of you? Why? I don't know. He may think ignoring him, Elroy. Yeah, I guess I have been ignoring him. If we could only track him down and explain. [WHISTLES] Orbitty find him. - You can find him? - Uh-huh. Well, okay, then. Let's get going. You're still turning blue, Orbitty. Maybe he's off in the other direction. This must be the right way. We're getting warm. Don't be sad, Rover. You won't be here long. We're shipping you off to the Dog Star Kennels in the morning. - Psst. Astro. - Hooray. How are you, boy? Yuck. [GROWLS] No, Astro. It was Orbitty who helped me find you. I'm sorry if I made you jealous. I didn't mean to. - Really? - Yes, really. Orbitty is sorry too. Yeah, me too. Woof, woof. You're the best dog any kid ever had. Aw. Thanks, Elroy. Well, save the thanks until I get you out of here. Hmm. How does this thing open? That looks too complicated for me. DOGCATCHER: Hey, who's out there? We gotta hide, quick. Okay, Rover, who were you talking to out here? I don't see anything, but I want quiet out here, understand? Yes, sir. All clear, Orbitty. Gee, I don't think I can open that lock. Hey, Orbitty will. ELROY: Hey, that's right. Orbitty can take anything apart. Hooray. Hooray! Freedom. I know I heard something out there this time. Uh-oh. Maxie, we've got a break. Hit the sirens. [SIRENS WAILING] I've spotted them, Maxie. Try and bust out of my kennel, will you? All right, hold it right there. This is my dog, mister. As long as he doesn't have a collar, I've gotta take him in. What's he got behind his back? ELROY: Oh, that's just an Orbitty. Orbitty-schmorbitty. Doesn't have a license, I'll have to take him in. Hey, what--? Leave that control alone. Hey, you can't do this. I work for the city, you know. Maxie ain't gonna believe this one. Wow, you're gonna get it. We should be very angry with you, young man. Mom, I just had to rescue Astro. Like your mother said, we should be angry. But we're just glad that you're home safe. Hooray. [LAUGHING] You too, Astro. [LAUGHING] Orbitty is the one who really saved Astro. That's right. Won't you change your mind? Can't Orbitty stay with us? - Please, George? - He is an endangered species. And I guess he needs to have a family of his own. And he is handy at fixing things. Hooray! Hold it, hold it. Where is Orbitty? I haven't seen him since you got home. [PURRS] Bye-bye. Orbitty, come back. We want you stay. That's right. Ah, gee, I guess he didn't hear us. Well, maybe it's best for him to leave. But we all love him. Yeah. He was so cute. Ta-da! [PURRING] Orbitty, you're back. Yeah. Woof, woof. [LAUGHING] Welcome to the family, Orbitty. You big show-off. You big show-off. Orbitty think you woof-woof. [GIGGLES] [LAUGHING]
