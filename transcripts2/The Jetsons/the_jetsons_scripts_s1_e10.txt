 Now that Daddy is gonna be the new office supervisor can I have a bigger allowance? What you give me now hardly buys anything. Well, we'll see, Judy. You know, Daddy hasn't been officially promoted yet. He's seeing Mr. Spacely about it this morning. Oh, I hope he gets the job. He deserves it. And besides, I need a new spring Strato-hat. Good heavens. What's that? Oh, It's Buddy Blast-off. He takes me to the school. Hy, Buddy! Hey, Spaz. Let's hit the space, chicken! - It isn't cute? - Cute?

 I've never even met the boy personally. At least he've come to the door. I telling him. Bye Ma. OK, Buddy! Check the... Buddy Blast-off, hum? Last week was Nick Noose Cold. Oh well. Now get George. Oh, George, time to get up you'll miss your appointment. Right with you, honey. Soon as I do my exercises. One, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight. Ah, boy I can feel that flab melting. Better not over-do it. Now for a fast lap around the track. 'Oh, boy. That sure stirs up the circuiation.' 'That's enough of that.' I'll do a couple of fast rounds with the old punching bag. Attaboy, George. Attaboy, George, kid. Give it to him. Harder. Faster. Give it to him. Give him the old one-two. I'd better quit. I'm starting to perspire. Elroy, why aren't you ready for school? I don't feel good, Mom. I think.. I think I'm coming down with Venus virus. Venus virus, eh? Last week, you said it was Martian mumps. Anything to miss the space calculus test. I tell you, I'm sick. Oh, this is it. It's growing black. Quick, where's a pencil? I gotta make out my will. Alright. Hold on. Just hold on. I'll call the doctor. Calling Dr. Racey, Dr. Ken Racey. Yes, Mrs. Jetson? Somebody got a pain in the tummy-tum-tum? It's Elroy, doctor. I think it's the Venus virus this time. Venus virus? Oh, that can be catching. (Dr. Racey) Alrighty, Elroy. This is your dedicated physician speaking. Stick out your tongue. Um,hmm. Aha. Oh, my. Well, what do you see, doctor? Two dozen gumdrops, a pastrami sandwich, half a pizza. Elroy! For breakfast? Well, you see I thought it was my last day on Earth. Well, it pains me to tell you, but there's only one known cure. What's that? A full day at school. You're fine. Awh, phooey. Elroy! Thank you, Dr. Racey. Sorry to call you needlessly. Think nothing of it, madame, it's my duty as the nation's number one dedicated physician. Which reminds me. One house call, the usual fee. No hurry on the bill. Tomorrow will be fine. Happy medicine. Well, Elroy, you've just spent your father's raise. - Gee, I'm sorry, Mom. - What raise? My goodness! If he doesn't get to work, he won't even have a job. Oh, George. You're late! I'll be ready in a flash, thanks to our Supersonic Dress-O-Matic. Let's see, now. Today's the big promotion. I'll wear my white button-down radiation shirt gray flannel space suit and black solar moccasins. I gotta look real sharp today. [beeping] (George) 'Now, wait! Wait! For crying out... Hold it! Help!' George, what's the matter? (George) 'Take a look.' [laughing] Ha ha ha. It's very funny. Now look, Janey, honey I know you bought that Dress-O-Matic for my birthday, but it has got to go. I've heard of short circuits, pop, but nobody'll believe this. Oh, you're lovely, George. That radiant complexion. What's your secret? [door bell] - Someone's at the door. - Yeah, I'll get it. - Who's there? - 'Henry, your dandy handyman.' Oh, good morning, Mrs. Jetson. I thought I heard some shouting. Say, it's nice perfume you're wearing. What do you call it? I call it an insult! That's what I call it! Mr. Jetson! Well, now. When's your birthday? I'll buy you a purse. Ha ha ha. Good morning, Mr. Jetson. My, this is your big little old day, isn't it? - I hope so. - I think it's just wonderful. You certainly deserve this promotion. Thank you, Miss Gamma.

No, now, Mr. Coward... I mean, Mr. Jetson. There's lots of other work around. I got a third cousin who's making out real well on Mars. I don't think I could take Mars, Henry.

I'm just on my lunch hour, sonny. And I heard what happened between you and your boss. Well, this is the last time I'll have to feed that repulsive robot of his. Say, let me play waiter. I'll just add a smidgen of my special spring tonic and whoopee! Tonic? But Unifink is supposed to get lubrication. - You know, oil. - 'Eh, now, don't fret, sonny.' One guzzle of this, and he'll be oiled for life. Well-oiled. Well, there's nothing like getting oiled, now, is there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Drink up, buddy. There's plenty more. Next time, I'll Iet you try it on the rocks. Now, where's this tax deduction of yours? This brain of brains? The board of directors would like to see it. Gentlemen, words won't do him justice. - Then bring him in. - Uniblab? Uniblab? Headquarters calling. (Spacely on intercom) 'The board of directors are here.' You are being paged, happy boy. Hic!

Believe me, not only is Spacely a stupe but he's king of the crabs. Not that reel! Change your record. It's the Outer Space Shake Shake Shake shake Five billion dollars for this? Get rid of him, Spacely, or you'll be out of a job. Uniblab, you're fired! Fired? you're fired, fatso. Help! Somebody turn him off. Help! Jetson! And that's the whole story. Right after I cut Uniblab's cable we picked him up and dumped him in the junkyard. And that's the last we'll see of him. Spacely was so happy he offered me the supervisor's job and a big raise. Oh, George, we're all so proud of you. [door bell] I'll get it. - Who's there? - 'It's me, Henry, Mr. Jetson.' Well, I finally went and did it. Did what, Henry? Well, I made plans for my vacation. And starting Monday, I'm spending a month on the moon! That's wonderful, Henry, but who's taking your job while you're away? Well, you know a labor short in this days, Mr. Jetson.
