 Miss Asteroid, what's going on out there? Who's making all that racket? It's just a building going up next door, Mr. Spacely. Sounds more like a building coming down. Someone bought that empty lot next door. Well, one good thing about this. Nobody could sleep through this racket. Not even Jetson. Jetson. Jetson. - Jetson! - What? What? Oh, hi, boss. Don't ''hi, boss'' me. Why don't you just move a bed in here. Huh? Oh, where would be put it? It's pretty crowded already. It'll be less crowded after you're fired. Now get to work and start pushing some buttons. Or are you trying to let that blowhard Cogswell catch up with us?

 Oh, never, Mr. Spacely. I wonder who's putting up that building next door. Well, I'll say this for the builder, he's getting the job done fast. Yes, sirree. Not like back in the old days... ...when it took them a week to put up a building. Hey, look, boss. They're putting up the sign. Now we'll find out who our neighbors are. ''S-G-O-C.'' ''Sgoc''? Well, what kind of a word is that? Maybe it's a foreign company. ''Sllews Goc.'' Must be a new product. Don't be ridiculous, Jetson. ''Sgoc Sllewgoc.'' ''Cogswell Cogs.'' Oh, it wasn't foreign after all. Cogswell Cogs? Why, that building belongs to Cogswell. He's moving next door so he can spy on us. No wonder his building is so close. Get to work, Jetson, and no more goofing off! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, he's gone. Oh, boy. What a slave driver. Jetson! Caught you again. Now, stop goofing off on my time! Your time! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, boy. One Spacely is enough, but six are positively sickening. Yes? Yes, Miss Sunspot? A Mr. Spacely is on his way in, Mr. Cogswell. I am busy! I tried to tell him, but he just kept going. You're darn right, I kept going. What are you trying to pull? Well, if it isn't the ex-king of sprockets. What do you mean, ''ex''? Cogswell's crummy cogs never saw the day... ...they could compete with my sprockets! Spacely! You've still got one chance. Sign a merger agreement... ...and I'll find some minor place for you in my organization. - Never! - Better sign! Otherwise, you'll be out of business so fast your head will spin. You mean like this. No, I mean more like this. Stick around if you want some more lumps. Meanwhile, you better sign. - Never! - In that case... ...sorry to see you leave. Hey! Let me out of here! If you insist. Jetson, we've got to keep Cogswell from snooping on us. Here's a blueprint of our property and Cogswell's. See if we can put up a 1 0-story fence... ...to keep him from spying on us. Any questions? Just one, boss. How do you read a blueprint? You got the whole night to learn. - I want them back tomorrow. - But, but-- - But-- - That's a funny way to resign, Jetson. But I've got tickets. After three years, I finally managed to get two seats for My Space Lady. - No? - Yeah. Well, that's different, my boy. Here. Sit down. Have a cigar? Comfortable? Good, good. That's fine. Yes, sirree. Mrs. Spacely is going to be very happy when I tell her. - Tell her what? - That you're letting us have your tickets. After all, you won't need them. Can't work on a blueprint while watching a show. Couldn't I work on them after the show? In other words, you put your amusement ahead of your job? Oh, every time. No! No, sir! I mean-- No, sir. I didn't think so. Give me the tickets. - Yes, sir. - Jetson... ...you've got the kind of employee loyalty that's going to carry you far. And right now, it's going to carry you back to work! That old ticket taker! How am I ever going to tell Janey? She's been looking forward to that show for months. What are you wearing to the show tonight? Well, Judy, I can't make up my mind, dear. Why don't we run the dress selector. - I guess I better. - I'll do it. Thanks, dear. Ready, Mother? Oh, we need the facsimile image. It's the second button from the top, Judy. All right. Turn on the dress selector. No, not this one. Early galaxy simply isn't in vogue this season. Oh! Isn't that a Christian Diorbit, Mother? Yes, but I wore it at the ballet last month. That one is perfect for the theater! Moon Bechet. It is stunning, isn't it? Sensational, Mom! Hi, everybody. I'm home. Oh, now, cut it out, Astro! Cut it out! Oh, Daddy, you've made him cry! Oh, I'm sorry, Astro. That's all right, George. This is what I'm wearing to My Space Lady tonight, George. Like it? - Why don't you ask Mr. Spacely. - What? Jane, I don't know how to tell you this. George, is something wrong? Well, for goodness' sake, just tell me. I'm your wife. Whatever it is, we'll take it in stride together. After all, I'm no child. - You won't be mad? - Of course not. I'm a mature woman. Well, I have to work on these blueprints tonight, so we can't see... ...My Space Lady. Now, let me see. A 10-story wall running between the buildings. - Hi, Pop. - Hi, Elroy. - What you doing, Dad? - Working. What are you doing out of bed? How come you're wearing space shoes in the house? You know better. I'm sorry, Dad. - Hey, what's this? - A blueprint of Spacely's buildings. And this? That's where Cogswell has put up a building right next door. Oh. Now, what's this dotted line? - That's the property line, I guess. - Gee. It runs right through Cogswell's building. Doesn't it? Well, on paper, but if, if, if-- What did you say? The property line runs through Cogswell's building? Well, doesn't it? It does. It does. It does! Yahoo! Janey! Janey, we got him! We got old Cogswell. He's a dead duck! Gee! It's lucky I had my space shoes on. It's the greatest thing ever! Cogswell's building is 6 inches over on Spacely's property. And you woke me up out of a sound sleep to tell me that? Oh, but, honey, you don't get it. This will put Cogswell out of business. And I'll be Spacely's fair-haired boy. My salary will be raised. I'll be promoted. Why, he might even make me vice president. Wonderful, George. Now, come to bed. Bed? I gotta tell Spacely. At this hour? Honey, this is too important. It can't wait. When next we meet, Mrs. Jetson... ...you may be related to the new vice president... ...of Spacely Space Sprockets. Geronimo! Mr. Spacely. Wake up! Wake up, Mr. Spacely! I got good news for you. Wake up! Jetson! What are you doing here? Can't you see I'm asleep? You nincompoop. Remind me to fire you in the morning. We've got him, Mr. Spacely. We've got Cogswell. And it's right here, in this here blueprint. All right, Jetson, I'll be fair. I'll let you explain first, and then I'll fire you! Oh, no, you won't. - Not after I tell you the big news. - What big news? Cogswell built this building 6 inches on your property. - Are you sure? - Here. See for yourself. Here's us and the property line. And here's Cogswell. What do you know? Why, this is awful, isn't it, Jetson? - Awful? - For Cogswell. Poor Cogswell. Oh, doesn't your heart bleed for him? - Well-- - Why, the poor fellow is in an awful pickle. And do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to nail the top on the pickle barrel so he'll never get out! Jetson. You're responsible for this. Starting right now, you are the new vice president in charge of expansion. - I am? - You bet, my boy. Yippee! Gosh. Thanks. You'll never regret it. You'll never regret it. Oh, boy. Oh, boy, am I happy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. So you better get right over while I'm still in a good mood, Cogswell. But it can't be! It's not possible! How? How? How? It's all here, Cogswell, in black and white. Or should I say, blue and white? Blueprints, you know? So long, Cogswell. Just the look on his homely face is worth it. Mr. Cogswell is here, sir. What took him so long? Send him in. Now, don't think this makes any difference to me, Spacely. You little pip-squeak. You always walk on your knees, Cogswell? Light my cigar, boy. I don't mind humoring you a little, Spacely. After all, we're old friends. Sure we are. We've been through a lot together. Had lots of fun. - Lots of laughs, right? - You bet. And the biggest laugh is right now. Laugh, Cogswell. - Ashtray. - Ashtray? Well, sure, Spacely, old pal. I think a reasonable adjustment is in order, but after all... ...what's 6 inches? I'll tell you what 6 inches is... ...the finish of Cogswell's Cogs! I'll give you 5000. - What did you say? - 10,000? 15,000? Oh, you're a real comedian, Cogswell. You should have gone into show business. Nothing like a massage to pep you up, hey, Cogsey? Then I'll make it 20,000. 22,500? Over easy, please. Now, you were saying? 50,000? 75,000? What do you want, Spacely? Just a teeny-weeny little favor. - A favor? - Yes. Your building is 6 inches over on my property, so... ...move it! Not a bad imitation of a cow, Cogswell. You have a future in vaudeville. Vau-- Vau-- Do something, or tomorrow you'll be out of business. But, Spacely, how can I move a whole building? All you gotta do is move it 6 inches... ...in the other direction! I'll be ruined! There, there, there, my boy. There will always be a place for you with Spacely Sprockets. As a night watchman! Work for you? - Never! - In that case-- Move it! You should have seen him, Jetson. ''Move it!'' I said. ''Move it?'' he said. ''Move it!'' I said. Oh, you did it, Vice President Jetson. And I'll never forget it. Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. Spacely. Don't mention it, George. ''Move it!'' Oh, that's a hot one! Well, as long as I'm vice president... ...I might as well get the feel of it. Let me see. Where will I start? George. Is anything wrong? Anything wrong? Can't a vice president call up his wife to say hello if he wants to? Vice president? Oh, George. I'm so proud. And now that your talents have finally been recognized... ...I think it's time I live up to our position. I know. - We should do more entertaining. - I know. - We should go out more. - I know. Which means dressing to your new position. - I know. - So I'm going out to buy... - ...a whole new wardrobe. - I know. - No! No! No! - Bye, dear. Oh, boy. Ruined! All because of 6 measly inches! All because somebody goofed. And our building is 6 inches over on that insect Spacely's property! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Is that all you can say, Harlan? ''Tsk, tsk, tsk''? I'm ruined. And all you can say is, ''Tsk, tsk, tsk.'' Mr. Tsk Tsk-- I mean, Mr. Cogswell... ...why do you have those blueprints upside down? What difference does it make how I ha--? - Upside down? - Yes, sir. There! Now you can read the measurements. But if it was upside down before... ...that's my building here. Yes, sir, sir. And his building here. And I'm not 6 inches over after all. Spacely is! Yes, sir, sir! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved! Oh, Harlan, my boy, get Spacely on the visaphone. Why should I come over to see you, Cogswell? You've heard my last two words. ''Move it!'' --yourself, Spacely! You better get over here fast, you little squirt. You might call it a business matter. Your business! What trick could he be up to? But it's not possible. It couldn't be. Oh, come now, Spacely. You can do better than that. But Jetson read those blueprints. Sure, he did. Upside down. Which is the way you've been running your business for years. Of course, I was only joking when I told you to move it. Why, of course. We had a great big laugh together, didn't we? And now we're gonna have another one. How come you're not on your knees? Oh, sorry, Mr. Cogswell, sir. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Your building is 6 inches over on my property. Now, what should we do about it? - Forget it? - Guess again. Merger? Try again. Move it? Right! Move it, Spacely! Get your building off my property! - Do you know what's next? - I know. So long, Spacely! Boy! I think I'll have one of these massagers put in my office. Oh, that Spacely sure knows how to live it up. Mr. Spacely, I wasn't through yet. Oh, yes, you were, Jetson! Remember those blueprints? Well, how could I forget? They started my new career! They ended it too! Well, if-- Huh? The building that's 6 inches over is this building! You read the blueprints upside down! No! -Yes! -Gulp! Of course, I'll be bankrupt. Ruined! Finished! And you know what that means, Jetson. I-- I'm not vice president anymore? You're not even a janitor around here! You're fired! Now, don't you worry, dear. You'll find another job. After all my years with the company... ...to be treated like this! We'll help out, Daddy. I'll get a job as a bubblehop at a space burger fly-in. And I'll help out too, Pop. I'll deliver-tate papers. Thanks, kids, but I'm used to Spacely Sprockets. It'll feel funny working somewhere else. That's all right, George. We love you. Of course we love you, Daddy. I'd sure like to give that Spacely a piece of my mind. He could use it, honey. He's losing his. Yes? Yes? What is it, Miss Sunspot? It's Mr. Spacely. - On his knees? - Oh, yes, sir. Good. Let him in. Look at me, Cogswell, a broken man. I'm here to throw myself at your mercy. Well, throw yourself right back where you came from. But it's only 6 inches. Spacely, you know what I've been thinking? Yes, yes, yes? Half the fun I get out of wheeling and dealing... ...is wheeling and dealing with a small wheel like you. With you out of business, there won't be any wheeling for a big wheel like me. So I am going to sell you my building. And I'm only going to charge you twice what I paid for it. But I don't need another building. Well, in that case, move it! All right, Cogswell. You win. I'll buy it. And it's all that Jetson's fault! Gee, I just had to come and take another look at the old place. There's my office window. My ex-office, I mean. Where I had my ex-job... ...my ex-future... ...my ex-vice presidency. ''Commissioner of buildings''? Hey, he's stopping at Cogswell's building. Looks like he's measuring the building. What's up, Mac? Well, we weren't sure, so I had to come out. But it's over. Over? Over what? Over regulation height. This is a Class 1684B Zone here. No building over 2200 feet allowed. Now, is that so? And how high is Cogswell's building? 2206 inches. Six inches over? This building will have to be torn down. Well, why can't they just cut off 6 inches? Against safety regulations. They should have checked with the department first. Oh! Oh, boy! We've got him. We've got Cogswell! Oh, boy! Wait till Mr. Spacely hears about this! I'll be vice president again. Thanks, mister. You just got me my job back. Never mind! Boy, you meet all kinds on this job. Mr. Spacely! Mr. Spacely! Wait till you hear the good news! Jetson! I thought I fired you. Now get out! Not so fast, Mr. Spacely. Cogswell, your late competitor, is through. Washed-up! Kaput! Yeah? Well, tell me about it. Well, first there's a little matter of my job. Out! Out! Out! And stay out! Very well. I imagine Cogswell will make me vice president... ...when he hears what I've got to say. Now, now, just a minute, Jetson. You really think you've got something, Georgie boy? I told you. It's the end of Cogswell. Well, just don't lie there. Tell me about it. Right after you sign this agreement. ''I, Cosmo G. Spacely, do hereby promise and agree that I will....'' ''Never fire George Jetson again no matter what happens.'' Thank you, boss. Okay, okay. Now tell me. How have we got Cogswell? Very simple. Did you ever hear of City Ordinance 1 684B? No, I haven't and what's that got to do with it? Everything. Cogswell's building has to come down. It's 6 inches too high. You get it? The building has to come down! Right. The building has to come down. Every bit of it. You dunderhead! You dolt! You blithering fool! I knew you'd be pleased. You blunderer! That's my building! Yeah, well-- Yours? I bought it this morning! Now get out before I lose my temper! You're fired! Now, wait a minute. You can't fire me, boss. I've got an ironclad contract, which guarantees me a job. This is one time I thought of everything. Well, I thought of almost everything. Faster, Jetson! Faster! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Help! Help! Jane, stop this crazy thing! Jane! Help! Jane! (ENGLISH)
