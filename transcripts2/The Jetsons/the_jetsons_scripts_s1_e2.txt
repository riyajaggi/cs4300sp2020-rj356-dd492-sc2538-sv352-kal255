Well, that's one down and one to go. - Honey, where's Elroy? - Oh, he's up at the playground, dear. Elroy, time for dinner. Gee, Pop, do I have to come now? Oh, that kid. Yes, Elroy, it's time to come home. Well, so long, Irving. See you tomorrow. Same time, same sandbox. Well, what took you so long? Oh, we were playing, Dad. All right, hop in the shower, son, and-- Playing what? Writing messages in secret code. See? Oh, let me see that. In secret code means: "Meet me tonight." Dad, that's supposed to be secret. Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute. - Means: "Don't be late." - But, Dad! Come on, suppertime, or ''wham bam bop.'' - What does that mean? - "Wham," if we're late for dinner... ...and "bam," your mother's gonna bop us. - Well, what will it be for dinner tonight? - I want a pizza! - Me too! - All right, to make it unanimous. Okay, one unanimous pizza coming up. Now, let's see. Oh, here's the card. ''Flying sausage pizza.'' Elroy! Can't you wait for the rest of us? Sorry, Mom. It's sure nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. You know, I had a talk with Judy, and that Jet Screamer is finished around here. - That's nice. - Night, Dad. Night, Mom. Can you mail this for me in the morning, please? And thanks! "Jet Screamer Song Writing Contest." George, wouldn't it be funny if she won? Funny? That's all we need. But I am gonna remove all doubts from the matter. George, what are you doing? I'm simply removing Judy's entry and replacing it with Elroy's secret code. But why, dear? Because with stuff like: - We got a guaranteed loser. You get it? - Oh, dear. George, isn't it late for Elroy to be up? Let's see. What time is it? 8:29. - Thank you. - It's all right. Elroy, bedtime. - And how are things in Outer Plutonia? - Not bad. - Glad to hear it. - Elroy! I gotta sign off. Old ''you know who'' is barking. I'll talk to you tomorrow on the 14 MG Y oscilloscopic. Faster, Bobby, can't you? I'm already going over 1000. What's the big hurry? My big chance is coming up on TV tonight. That's what's the big hurry. Judy, what's the rush? They're gonna announce the winner of the contest on The Jet Screamer Show. Oh, Mother, I'm so excited! Judy, honey, you realize the chances are a million to one against you. And now, the exciting announcement for some lucky girl. Remember, Judy, we can't all be winners. And the winner of the Jet Screamer Contest is... ...Miss Judy Jetson! I'm sorry you didn't win, honey-- Judy Jetson? And her prize is a date with Jet Screamer! Baby, baby, baby! And I'd like to sing the winning song called ''Eep Opp Ork Ah-Ah ''... ...which means, ''Meet me tonight. '' - Oh, no, you don't! - Hey, he knows the secret-code message. Mom, I won! I won! I have a date with Jet Screamer tomorrow night! I have a date. I have a d-- - I think I'm gonna faint. - Move over. Make room for me. But, George, "Eep Opp Ork Ah-Ah" ... ...was Judy's idea in the first place, so she won anyway. That's right, Pop. She wrote it for me yesterday. All right, Elroy, go to bed. I don't think Jet Screamer would care too much about going out on a date with Elroy. That's right. He's not my type. - You heard me! - Yeah, I know. ''Elroy, go to bed.'' I still don't like that ''baby, baby, baby'' coming over here. Oh, now, settle down, George. He's probably a little shy. Yeah, a little shy in brains. Well, I've just made up my mind. No date for Judy. Oh, dear. This must be him now. Now, please, George. Please try to be pleasant. Baby, baby, baby, I am here... ...the star of the evening, Jet Screamer! Jane, now listen to me, Jane... ...I want this bunch of phonies out of here right now. Stand by for the television interview. George, how nice. We're going to be on television.
