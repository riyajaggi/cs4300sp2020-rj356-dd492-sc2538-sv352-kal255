Well. yes. l am. And you are? Curly Quasar. We're in the same Cosmic Literature class. Really? Uh.... Do you know space cars. Burly? Mine is dead. l'll check it out. And the name is Curly. No big problem. Judy. You just ran out of fuel pellets. How could l forget fuel pellets? -Maybe your mind was on something else. -Gee. that's very perceptive of you. Burly. l was rushing to get a perm for my annual surprise birthday party Saturday. -l've gotta go. -l popped spare pellets in your tank. They'll get you to where you're going. Well. happy surprise birthday party. Bye. Thanks again. Burly. The name's Curly. Curly Quasar. Curly Quasar? Is he cute? -He has other fine qualities. -Oh. he's rich. l don't think so. He's not cute. isn't rich. what else is there? Don't be such a skeptic. Now. listen. The very next day... ...th?ngs started off normally enough. Good morning. Miss Jetson. l have a few reminders for you today. Oh. hello. Memo Minder. It can't be morning already. Have l ever lied to you before? ln any case. as of today. you have exactly 257 days of school left. How totally exciting. Any good news? You have a date with Gaylord Gamma tonight. So you wanted to have your lavender jump suit cleaned? But Gaylord is a senior. l should wear something more mature. Like my Venusian two-piece. Excuse me. Ahem. Didn't your mother make you return that particular dress because it was. uh... ...ahem. too mature? JUDY: Okay. the lavender jump suit then. So. what other exciting reminders have you? Oh. yes. Saturday is your birthday. And my family always throws me a terrific surprise party. But they can't keep a secret. l always find out. Ahem. Didn't you ask them not to throw you a party this year? Of course. Reverse psychology is very important... ...when communicating with parents. l'll know all the party secrets by lunchtime. [CHUCKLES] l'm very clever at snooping. [SNORING] Spacely. you're a spineless space shrimp. Now. clear your desk off and get out. [LAUGHING] ALARM: _ttent?on, Jetson. You m?ssed reve?lle by two m?nutes. Now. fall ?n. Up and at them. Surely. in a moment. ALARM : Don't call me Sh?rley, sold?er. GEORGE: This is the last time we buy army surplus. Come on, Jetson. Hup, hup, hup. [ALARM CONTINUES CHANTING] Yeow! If that alarm can't tell the difference... .. .between hot and ice-cold shower water... ...l'm gonna pull its plug for good. How's your top-secret project coming. Elroy? Oh. don't worry. Dad. l think l'll have it finished by the end of the week. Ah. ha. ha. The morning news. Good boy. Astro. There'll be a little something extra in your doggy bowl tonight. Thanks. George. That tastes terrible. Blech. Do you mind. Astro? Oh. sorry. Georgey. ANNOUNCER [ON TV] : From the solar deserts to the Mart?an seas... ...th?s ?s the Mebulous Mews Metworh. l can't do the news dressed l?he th?s. Maybe you'd better get yourself another talent. Maybe we wouldn't have th?s problem... ...?f your dog wouldn't b?te holes ?n the news d?sh. [GROWLS] That's all right. boy. All l want is the sports page anyway. H?. sports fans. The Ch?cago Comets clobbered the C?nc?nnat? Satell?tes, 76 to 1 7. Wow. 76 to 1 7. How about some bacon. toast and eggs. honey? Hi. Mom. Daddy. Elroy. why are you playing with your junk in the dining room? lt's not junk. and l'm not playing. -This is a very important invention. -Daddy. She's right. Elroy. Take it into your room. Okay. but you're suppressing creative genius. you know. Pbbr. Oh. children. ANNOUNCER: Was snagged by Torpedo Tucher w?th ?ust seconds to play. You know. Daddy. time certainly flies. doesn't it? Yeah. l remember when Tucker was just a rookie. l mean. it hardly seems like a whole year has passed. All things must pass. dear. That's enough cream. thanks. What l'm trying to say is. none of us look a whole year older. right? That's because your mother and l only count every third year. Let's see what my horoscope says. Gee. l thought you Libras didn't believe in astrology. Ho. ho. Very funny. L?bra s?gns should be aware th?s weehend ?s for all to share. Oh. that reminds me. Judy dear. about this Saturday-- -Oh. you mean about my-- -Your father and l are going out. l understand. You won't be here Saturday night. No. we got something really special planned. JUDY: Naturally. [JUDY LAUGHS] -Don't you want any breakfast. Judy? -No. l'm already late. l'll grab some pancake tablets on my way out. Something big's planned for Saturday night. My surprise birthday party. Whoopee! Well. Di-Di now the plot begins #o thicken. Good. There should be one thicken in every plot. l've always felt strongly about that. Di-Di. please. This is my life. Sorry. l get surly when l don't sleep. Do continue with your fascinating story. _U_Y: So l'm cru?s?ng along on my way to school... ...when who should pop up Iook?ng for a r?de but.... Curly Quasar. Hey. Judy. Judy Jetson. l'll pretend not to see him. Hey. Judy. can you give me a ride? She's in some hurry. Must be late for class. He's really quite nice. l hate to be a snob. but l really can't afford to be seen around campus... ...with someone who's not part of the elite in-crowd. After all. l have an image to protect... ...and peer pressure is heavy-duty stuff with us teenagers. But l can't help feeling a little guilty just the same. Perhaps l'm just not in touch with my real feelings. l'm gonna have to give this some thought. Maybe there is more to life than good looks and popularity. But not at my school. Hey. l got two spectacular tickets for the Jet Screamer concert Saturday night. Sorry. Mickey. l hate to disappoint Jet Screamer. but l can't go. Uh-oh. Here comes that Curly Quasar. l've gotta go. Mickey. Judy? Now. what made her leave so quickly? Probably trying to avoid someone. Oh. don't take it personally. Mickey. She's probably just late for class. l'm out of here. You rejected Mickey Meteorite? l had to keep Saturday night open... ...because my family always throws me a surprise birthday party. As usual. every hunk ?n school called. Oh. come on. Judy. Show?ng up w?th the star athlete at the pep rally? lt'll be good for your ?mage. Not to mention your image. [PHONE RINGS] Hold on. Andy. l've got another call. H?. Judy. doll. How about you, me, and the satell?te races Saturday n?ght? JUDY: Negative. Nick. l can't make it. [PHONE RINGS] H?, Judy, wanna pa?nt the galaxy red w?th me Saturday n?ght? AN_Y: Blast off. Meteor?te. l asked her f?st. NICK: Yeah, and she told you to forget ?t. Thanks for the invite. guys. but Saturday night is booked. Over and out. Bye. Oh. you must have loved getting all that attention. lt beats being ignored. Please. do go on with your wonderful and exciting story. Well. next... ...l tr?ed to get some ?nformat?on out of Ros?e. Rosie. -We can talk girl-to-girl. can't we? -l don't know anything. Oh. come on. Anything unusual happening here Saturday night? Well. Miss Judy. your folks are going to a very special event. [CHUCKLING] Yeah. so l hear. Thanks. Rosie. _U_Y: Well, D?-D?, l ?ust had to learn more about Saturday n?ght. So l got down to some ser?ous snoop?ng... ...and checked Elroy's room for any ?ncr?m?nat?ng b?rthday g?fts. [WHISTLES] -What are you doing in my room? -Oh. just curious about... ...what you have in this box. Judy. don't open that. [SCREAMS] ELROY: Orbitty. help. Judy freed my Saturn slugs. Slugs! Blech! Mother. do you know what your son is keeping under his bed? Yes. dear. Saturn slugs. You just got a call from another boy. Oh. If only l were rich instead of so popular. lt was a Curly Quasar. He left his number. asked you to call. Me? Miss Popularity call Curly Quasar? He seemed nice enough. Oh. Mother. he's nice all right. but he's just not with it. -Know what l mean? -Certainly not. -What are you holding behind your back? -Must you know everything? Oh. Mother. you can't fool me. You know how much l wanted to get new clothes this year. Sorry. that's your father's tuxedo. We have a formal engagement Saturday night. Excuse me. dear. Wow. Iooks like l don't even have a normal engagement for Saturday night. So. Di-Di. Mom and Dad would never dress formally for my birthday... ...so l was finally convinced my party was over before it ever began. JUDY: Th?s t?me, D?-D?, l really messed up. Here ?t was. Saturday n?ght... ...Elroy was go?ng to show h?s ?nvent?on to Henry Orb?t. He and Orb?tty had plans to spend the n?ght ?n Henry's tool closet. Yuck. Mom and Dad left for the?r b?g event. gl?sten?ng ?n the?r formal cloth?ng. For a wh?le. ?t looked l?ke l was at least gonna have Astro for company that n?ght. But then Ros?e took h?m to the dog groomer. And l was all alone. Well. every night can't be New Year's Eve. Terrific story. Loved it. Think l'll nod off now. Good night. But. Di-Di. there's a big finish. l can hardly wait. Well. this is one birthday girl who isn't staying home on her big night. MICKEY [ON RECORDING] : You'ye reached M?ckey Meteor?te, Mr. Terr?f?c.
