 [theme music] [phone ringing] Yes? What? Just looked in to say good night. Good night. You staying over? Yes. Anything the matter? Of course not. Ah, Faith, you said awhile back

 that we'd soon have to get supplies for Le Crest sorted out. Yes? Well, I'm ready when you are. Just say the word. Good. I will. I mean, it can't be far off now. What? The rising. We've already asked them to prepare to mobilize. So? Well, hadn't we better get to work? The few stand guns they've got aren't going to be much use

 against the German army. Gordon, please. Well, these things take time. Enough, Gordon. Your job is to look after personnel and supervise supplies. And to give you the benefit of my experience in the field. When it's asked for. Look, I know some of these agents. Like it or not, they are my concern. And it may surprise you to learn that although, as you never tire of pointing out I have never been in the field myself, I too feel some concern for them. Something's wrong, isn't it? Don't be ridiculous. I knew it. Please, Gordon. I have a lot of work to do before I can go to bed. And the sooner you tell me what's going on, the better. Good night. [slams door] Saying that this is you to back home, eh? Look, in there. In the back. In the back. KONIG: We've had patrols up all night, sir. Every road, every vehicle has been checked. You are telling me you have found nothing? And I've started house to house searches. And? Nothing. Nothing as yet. Obviously, they'll try to get back to Le Crest. Keep the patrols and roadblocks going. It's just possible they decided not to move far until later on today. - Very good, sir. No, it is not, Konig. It is an embarrassing failure, which reflects badly on us all. We can't even keep the terrorists once we've caught them. No, sir. Have his picture pasted up everywhere, all over the place. Threaten random reprisals if he does not surrender himself. Reprisals, sir? Against the innocent. That should force him out. After all, he's a priest, a man of conscience. God answered my prayers with a speed which I didn't dare hope for. I might have known he'd get all the credit. Well, of course, but I'll say a special prayer for you in Mass. Rex, you won't be back in church for a while. Courmont's not safe. You go back there, they'll simply pick you up again. My people need their priest. What else is there apart from their faith that keeps them going? God didn't choose to release me from prison-- They won't bother with prison next time. And you'll be no use to anyone riddled with bullets. I can go into hiding in the village. Take Mass in secret. It wouldn't be safe, Father. There's an informer. We know that. How else did they know to pick you up? Look, I'm prepared to risk everything. It's not only you taking the risk. Anyone who hides you, looks after you-- You shouldn't ask it of them, my friend. Where do I go? Come in. Morning. Morning. Still here? Special delivery from the War Office. I've arranged a meeting with Wilson of Supplies. Have a preliminary chat about Le Crest-- Look, Gordon, I thought we'd been through-- Yes? Nothing. Nothing at all. All right. Another coffee? No, thanks. I've had me fill of acorns for the time being. Wine? Now you're talking. Bottle of your best. Want to strip the paint of a couple of doors. What? Never mind. You're waiting, aren't you? For them? Adele didn't come home last night. I hope she's all right. Don't you worry, dear. Your little friend is one of life's survivors. Talking of which-- Good morning, Dominique. And how are we today? Well, I made contact all right, but too late to get home. I had to share a room in some seedy little hotel in Beaufort. Oh, how frightful. Your usual, energetic self, I see. No, no, well, when you're not here, I just don't know what to do. I just go all to pieces. A token for the telephone, please, Nicole. Damn, I didn't think they'd be checking the back roads. Papers? Somewhere. What is your business? Where are you going. Dupois. I'm a vet from Saint Agnoine. This is my assistant. We're picking up strays in the area. Strays? Yes, you know, this rabies scare. But I'm sure the dogs in the back are all clean, if you want to take a look. Everything's in order. Your papers. Thank you very much. You've not heard any barking around here, have you? No, I-- no. Good. Thank you. I'm going back to the farm. Adele might go there first. I'm just so worried about her. Does your friend want a drink? I must pay a visit. I'll go and ask her. What on earth were you going there? Of course, we must. Well, the-- the house would seem the obvious place. Soon as I can manage it. I'll phone back if there's a problem, OK? What the hell are you snooping around for? Sorry, I simply wondered if you wanted a drink. I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself. Can't even make a private call-- Oh, for heaven's sake. I wasn't listening to your bloody conversation. You really can be such a tiresome little man, Antoine. Right. What the bloody hell's going on? And this time, don't tell me it's none of my business. These supplies for Le Crest, Wilson tells me they've been canceled and on your orders. You made me a look a right Charlie. I'm sorry, Gordon. Then why didn't you tell me the rising was off? It isn't. What? It is to proceed. A decoy operation to make the Germans think we're about to invade the southern coast, as well as in the north. But with no supplies? And what about the paratroopers? I am instructed that every man, every rifle will be needed for the landings. That means they'll have nothing. That can't be true. I got the order this morning. Le Crest is to be mobilized immediately. Mobilized? With what? Pitchforks? Milking stools? What are you to allow this, apart from a cold-hearted, unfeeling spinster that is? Please, Gordon. How can you do this, Faith? How can you do it? I can't. I'm going to resign. It's rather basic, I'm afraid. It'll feel very strange. I'm used to being surrounded by people and problems. Can you get word to my congregation that I'm all right? I'll do that. They won't be the only ones who will miss you, Father. Go on. Get back home, both of you. I don't want to sound ungrateful, but get me out of here, Clemont, soon. As soon as it's safe. If there's anything you want-- I'll let you know. Clemont? All There is something. Yes? A Bible. You can't resign. - There's no alternative. - Faith-- I've tried to justify it. I've racked my brains for days. Duty, King, and country, but I will be knowingly sending hundreds of people to their deaths. In the end, it's exactly the same lack of respect for human life that we condemn in Hitler. If you resign, someone else will simply step in and do the dirty work. That's no reason to stay. There's a line that has to be drawn and this is it. I see. So Le Crest will be a sitting duck, but you can relax in your Kensington apartment safe in the knowledge that it all has nothing to do with you. Look, Max, if I felt there were any channels left open to-- There might be, but we need to buy time. If we could only persuade them to wait for the southern invasion-- Come on, Max. The whole point of the operation is to divert German troops from the landings in the north. If we postpone, they're even more likely to snuff it out. No, the logic may be appalling, but it's correct. So our only hope is to reinforce. Send in paratroops, munitions, give them a fighting chance. We've been through all that. All support has been diverted to theaters of operation in more urgent need. No, it's too late, Max. Unless, unless we try the Americans. And what about our outfit in Algiers? They have the equipment and personnel, if they can be persuaded to use them. They might even have the necessary aircraft. Max? We just need a little time, a few days. One more try, Faith. You owe it to them and to yourself. Get me General Liddiard. It's urgent. How did it go? Like a dream. Our new recruit was superb. You've a very brave girl. Didn't doubt that for an instant. Well, now, you're here. I'll have to go. Lots to do. We need to talk later. You know where to find me. Sylvie, we're all in your debt. Did she mention her meeting with Regis, by the way? It went well. I think she terrified him into submission. He's going to help us. That's a relief. It's an even greater relief to have you back. She's a difficult woman. Yes. But you must admit, she's direct and a damn good agent. I don't know. She worries me. Now, don't start confusing dislike with distrust. That can be dangerous-- There's something nervy about her, jumpy. I'm sure something's up. I sense it. Nicole? Nicole? Adele? What is it? It was a nightmare. It was awful. What? No, it's all right. You didn't say you'd be out all night. You didn't wait up? Well, I thought they had you. I thought you were dead. I don't know. Nicole, it all went fine. Look at me. We're all safe. Oh, God. You look terrible. I'll make some coffee. And I have to meet Renard. I thought they had you. Two things you have to learn. One, no one gets told more than the bare minimum. And the second is more difficult. Never worry about anyone else. I know. I know. I'm sorry. It's all right. God, look at me, Adele. A mess, what a mess. Here borrow this. Oh, thanks. Borrowing clothes. It's like having a sister. Only sisters never wait to be asked. They just take. Well, I wouldn't know. I've never had a sister. Oh no. What's the matter? It's Luc. Look, I can't face him just now. Not on an empty stomach. Will you tell him I had to go out? Hello, Luc. Nicole. Adele's not here I'm afraid. She's had to go out. Oh, yes? Adele! Adele, for god's sake, will you stop and listen? Adele. Running away like that. What is it Luc? I want to talk. Ah, a social visit. You never used to be so sarcastic. I've changed. Haven't we all? Please. He's not used to mutiny in the ranks. When you mentioned resignation, his mustache started to tremble. Did you see? A worried man. It was the prospect of a row with your lot. Whatever. It's bought us a few days. You were formidable, Faith. Well, we made a good team. It was when you suggested French or American participation that his eyes really lit up. He knows we're in a mess. He'd love to wash his hands of the whole affair. So a brief reprieve. We can plan a campaign. I must try to get through to Algiers. Yes, and I must give new orders to our people. I'll see you later. Faith, I would like to see you later very much. Thank you, Max. I'd like that too. I suppose what I wanted to say-- to tell you was-- Yes? Well, I was going to say that I didn't understand what was going on with you. But then of course, I do entirely, which is why-- well, why I'd been so-- Aggressive? Yes. No, angry. I see. I suppose it's a very old story, isn't it? I've been making a fool of myself and-- well, it's time I had the courage to admit defeat. And that's what I've come to tell you. Look, I just don't feel anything anymore. I do what I have to do. I get on with my scheds. I know I did feel something for you. I think I did once. Did you? Wasn't it just guilt? I suppose in the end it's the same as love. When it's not returned, it becomes hate. But I don't hate you, Luc. Perhaps you hate me. I know you blame me. I know you do. You owe me nothing. Nothing at all. Damn. I know exactly what I was going to say on my way here. But it's all got confused again. It would be stupid of me to pretend I never need to think of you again. When nothing else makes sense, when the guy next to you gets his head blown to bits and you-- I know I'll think of you then. Is that love? I don't know. I'd like to think perhaps it is. Yes. I've tried to say what I mean. It isn't easy. Luc-- It'll be on your terms, Emily, if you want it that is. Luc. I know my time's up. I'd better go. No, don't go. Nothing out here really makes any sense, does it? Come here. Hold me. An amended message for Adele. I see. Faith, the things I said this morning-- By the way, look after it yourself, will you? I need to be sure it's gone out all right. That it's in good hands. Right. I'll have it transmitted straight away. I've been asleep. Only for a few minutes. Were you watching me? Yes. You look so peaceful like that. I feel it. Don't you? Just when I thought I had it all sorted out. It's always the most confusing time of war. What's the time? You're so romantic. Seriously. Just gone three. What? What's wrong? They'll be trying to transmit. Get that the teleprinter to Henley, straight away. - They suit you. - Shh, they'll be starting soon. You shouldn't even be in here anyway. Luc, stop it. Get out. Luc, stop it. You love it. - Shh. - What? Oh, damn. I've missed it. No, it's all right. Come in. I've sent it. What? The message to Adele telling her not to mobilize Le Crest. Good. The irony is, you know, they'll probably be disappointed. Anything interesting? Well, I suppose you'll know soon enough. Last night was a good omen. That was the order to mobilize Le Crest. Yes, he's an excellent contact, our Monsieur Regis. He's preparing a mixed bag for us, chloroform, various drugs, and bandages and stuff. Should be ready for us tomorrow. - Good work, Dominique. We'll send a courier down. No, no, it's all right. I'll go myself. Avoid the possibility of a snarl up. No, when things start to get moving-- and they will do any day-- I'll need you here. You don't understand-- Hang on a minute. What are you trying to do? Put me on the dole? This is a courier's job? Antoine. And why the burning desire to get back to Beaufort? This is none of your business. I just want to finish what I've started. I'm sorry. That's not possible. I can't afford to spare you for pickups, Dominique. And equally, I can't afford friction between my agents. It's on. You're sure? I've just heard. Immediate mobilization. - But you've got the posters up? - Everywhere, sir. And nothing yet? I see. It's the French, sir. They're changing. Getting more confident, less cooperative. So how do we flush out this meddlesome priest? Burn down his church? Well? I don't-- that is-- I am-- I am a Catholic, sir. I know that Klaus. I was at your christening remember. What comes first, faith or duty? With the French playing up, can we afford to have consciences? I don't know, sir. I'll talk to Philippe Bonnard. He's a sensible man who knows it is in his interest to keep me happy. Perhaps he'll come up with a tidier solution. I would not like to think I was putting your eternal soul in jeopardy Klaus. Your mother would never forgive me. But we must get this wretched priest come hell fire or damnation. Hi, Reg. Morning, Miss. Max. It's Ah, and about time. What do you mean? We have to walk a little way. Where are we going? Why for a picnic, of course. Max. We need to get things moving. First, cut all the links with Beaufort and Le Plane. Nicole, there's a package in the drawer behind the bar. Give it to me. But we keep the internal telephone systems in tact? As per the plan, use it to spread the word across Le Crest. But all the external lines and transport links must be cut. And I'll get word out to the Marquis and the surrounding areas. And we'll get our men to hold and block the passes. Nobody will move in or out. I'll see to it now. Stay where you are. We'll start first thing in the morning Nicole, that bottle of Cognac I've been saving. Let's break it open, huh? I've been waiting four years for this. Max, that was wonderful. You don't think it was foolish and undignified? No. It's good to do such things sometimes. Yes. And you planned it beautifully. You always say the right things, Faith. Do I? But it's not just on the surface. It comes from within. You're doing your best to live up to the image, aren't you? What? The charming Frenchman, so gallant. And you, too. The English always beautiful and aloof. Sometimes. You know, you're not nearly as intimidating as you think. How disappointing. Except when it matters. Well done, this morning. I'm happy, Max. For the first time in, oh, I don't know how long. So you should be. It's not every day our superiors are persuaded to change their minds. It's not just that. No. I must go now. I'll walk you. You know what to do? With all of these new people coming in, you'll have to watch out for informants. Don't worry. When the telephone line is cut and the pass is guarded, they won't be able to get any messages through. They'll be trapped. What about weapons? We've got precious little. Antique sporting rifles and a few Steyn guns. Don't worry, Renard. Adele has a sched this afternoon. She'll get all the details of the drops then, I hope. So do I, Clemont. Won't take the Germans long to look work out what's going on. Just thank god they don't know what sort of state we're in. Well, as I said, it takes time. Time is running out. Often the mere threat of reprisals is enough. Not this time, unfortunately. The warnings we have posted about that priest have brought in nothing at all. Don't they realize we're on the same side, your people? God in Heaven. What is happening to them? I don't know. But perhaps they feel the attitude of-- We are friends Philippe. Please go on. Well, perhaps they feel the German authorities are not as benign as they had hoped. Do you? I'm a realist. Our army was defeated. There's no denying that. I have a job to do. Life must go on. And we must make the best of it. Teachers must be paid. Transport organized. The people must be fed. Justice administered. Of course, I hope the occupation will end. Of course. We have our own lives to lead too. Families, homes-- In the meantime, I must do what I can to make life bearable for my people. That is my duty. Precisely, Philippe. I could not have expressed it better myself. We understand each other. Konig? I'm sorry to interrupt, sir. I thought you should know. The telephone wires to and from Le Crest have all gone dead. As I was saying, Philippe, what are we going to do with these people? Good. Look, everybody's up to their Eyes here. Maybe I should go back to Beaufort for those supplies after all. Dominique, I've said I need you here. Anything could happen. So who else do we send? A woman's so much safer than a man. I'll go. No, you're too-- Inexperienced? How many priests do I have to spring? It's time, Clemont, to let go. All right. Clemont. Are you sure you want to go? Of course. Insist on seeing Regis personally. And if anybody asks, you're an off-duty nurse. Good luck. Thanks. Sylvie. Sit down, Klaus. Thank you, sir. A decent man, our prefect, don't you think? Yes, sir. Sir? What are we going to do about Le Crest? Take a patrol. See what the hell is going on. And Klaus, you'll take care, won't you? These are dangerous times. Yes? I've come to collect the supplies. Speak up, girl. I can't hear you. I said, I've come to collect the supplies. Supplies, what supplies? They were to be ready this afternoon. They were authorized by a Monsieur Regis. Well, that's me, my love, but I don't know anything about-- And were ordered by Dr. Valois. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. And Dr. Valois, she is-- Too busy. Of course. Please, will you wait a moment. Hello, Philippe. Oh, of course, the theatrical entrance. Do you know I'd expected you to ring the bell? Come in through the main door. Silly of me. Well, what do we do? Kiss, shake hands? Please, tell me. You were always good on etiquette. Philippe, I haven't got-- No, really. I've never done this before. What exactly is the form for greeting an ex-wife? It's all exactly the same. What did you expect? Exactly the same. No one must know that I'm here. Don't worry. Since you sneaked in the back way, she'll assume I'm entertaining some unpresentable tart. You make a habit of that, do you? Well, I thought we were never to see each other again. So did I. We were both wrong. What's going on, Virginia? Oh, I never did like that painting. It's tasteless, utterly tasteless. What are you doing here? It's completely out of proportion with this room. Seeing it anew, it looks even more ghastly, Virginia. I'm with a Red Cross unit traveling through France. Ah, of course, the Red Cross. But you are stationed around here temporarily? Yes. Just outside Beaufort for a couple of days. You're a nurse? I did some basic training, very basic, very dull, bandages, burns. So you're a nurse? Yes. I'm a nurse. And I'm Louis the 14th. You do love to spin me a yarn. But you do it so badly. Don't ask, Philippe. Just don't ask. No really. I haven't the remotest idea. Is it some new form of gambling in privileged British society? Cross to occupied France and back and win an extra 50 ration books. Don't. Or perhaps you simply wanted to check that I was still in pieces. Of course, that would appeal to your vanity. You know, don't you? You know exactly why I'm in France. Yes, of course, I damn well do. What are we going to do, sir. Just sit here for a bit. Wait and see what happens. You have no idea. No idea at all what you've got yourself involved in. I know exactly what I'm doing and why. No, you think you're the lead actress in some tatty English film. Proud, courageous, heroic-- Just like you, huh? At least I live in the real world. What if we'd all taken a chance on becoming heroes? The whole state would have collapsed. France would have been taken over completely. Which is exactly what happened. No, because some of us took on the responsibility to keep her alive. Didn't run away at the first sign of trouble. You forget that I ran away from you as much as the Nazis. I didn't fit into some vain, romantic vision. You didn't marry me. You married a childish ideal. - That's ridiculous. - Yes, it is. Escape to France. Marry a foreigner. How romantic. Then escape again when I failed to make you feel like a princess. And try to love a woman instead. You're deluding yourself. Your noble France has become part of the German empire. You're a puppet, Philippe. And Stuckler's pulling the strings. I'm making the best of a bad job. We have to see it as a new beginning, a chance to create a society by planning, not by accident, like we used to talk about. A fairer-- No, don't you dare start on that one now. Even you can't miss the brutality-- It's people like you. If there are reprisals, blame yourself. Why on earth do I ever think it was worth coming? Every logical thought in my brain said that it wasn't worth the effort. But I thought-- I hoped that I could get through to you somehow, convince you, even ask for your help. You are quite mad, Virginia. My name is Dominique. So if you are not amenable to reason, perhaps I should try something else. What do you mean? Your position here is a little compromised, don't you think? There can't be many prefects of France whose ex-wives are British agents. Should a juicy little tidbit like that get abroad, it could have far-reaching consequences. So it's come to this, has it? Think about it, Philippe. Perhaps you should reflect yourself, Dominique. Your position is infinitely more vulnerable than mine. All right. Call your friend Stuckler. Be a hero. Betray your wife. Take the men on the right and fan out. What about you, sir? Someone has to go ahead. Just stay behind me. Good New Maude. Well, that makes a change, a meeting that actually achieved something. Has Colonel Dubois been on the phone? No. Is something the matter, Gordon? I think you'd better sit down. What is it? There's been some confusion over the transmission to Le Crest. What is it? I've had it checked and double-checked-- For God's sake, Gordon, what does it say? Message received, stop. Spirits high, but weapons low, stop. Await news of drops and reinforcements at earliest convenience, stop. Mobilization well underway, stop. I also asked them for details of arms drops and reinforcements. So when do we get a reply? Well, this evening, I hope. I made it urgent. Well, let's hope there's some good news. Luc and the others managed to see that first lot off, but they'll be back. This time, they'll bring their friends with them. I only- Renard. Renard, it's all under control. Sylvie. Here we are. He said he'd let us have more in a couple of days. Sylvie, that's very good. Hang on a minute. You'd better have a look at this. Unless this priest surrenders to the German authorities, there will be swift and severe penalties. What are you going to do Renard? I don't know. Go and see him I suppose. So what am I going to tell her then, Faith? - Who is it? - It's all right Rex. It's Renard. How are you my old friend? I didn't expect anyone so soon. I thought you should be in on the good news. The uprising's started. Already? I thought you might want to drink the health of the new French Republic. Oh and somebody said you wanted this. What is it? Well, it's not "Das Kapital." More's the pity. You look worried. Me? I'm worried about the rising. That we haven't got the wherewithal to survive it. Of course. Nothing else? Nothing you want to tell me? No, of course not. What else could there be? Fine. I'll go and get something to drink this out of. What happened? It was terrible, sir. Took us by surprise. The lieutenant walked along to see what was going on. So quiet it was. And then, they shot him like a dog, sir, like a bloody dog. Yes. You see anything else? They had the road blocked, sir, further up. They raised their flag. Perhaps it's some sort of rising? Perhaps. Leave him for God's sake. I'll take him. And send Captain Metzhofen to me. I have a job for him. Right, sir. He was my godson, you see. No. Oh, no. How exciting. I'd love to move. We have moved before haven't we, Sylvie? Yes, Mother. I'm not going on my own, am I? I couldn't, Regis. Mother-- Of course not, Mrs. Schneider. Sylvie will be going with you. I couldn't manage without Sylvie. She's all I have, you know? All I've had since Mr. Schneider went away and left me. Oh, Ma, he didn't leave you. He was taken away by them. He must take him with us. I shouldn't like to be without him. Quick. Out the back.
