 MAN 1: We're clear? MAN 2: Mm-hm. FBOTH GRO ANING] MAN 1: Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. MAN 2: Right. MAN 2: Good. That's it. FBOTH GRUNTING] FPEOPLE CHATTERING] So, uh... So, what are you thinking right now, Danny? I'm thinking, why did Pez ever agree to let you do this? GABRIEL: Documentary film is the last vestige of visual truth... ...the last bastion of societal objectivism... ...and I guess she's just that kind of a girl.

 - Probably wants out of the relic business. GABRIEL: You're crossing the line. DANNY: What? - Um, the imaginary axis... ...separates screen-left, screen-right orientation. You're crossing it. Mellow out, Fellini. Yeah. Well, we've arrived at the crime scene. VICKY: Hey, Danny. DANNY: Hey, Vic. What up? Someone air-holed a couple of guys, but averted a felony arson. - You mean murdered them? - I'd say it's more like a public service. These guys were here to burn the place down... ...but the shooter stopped them. - That the owner there? He the shooter? - No, no, no. Mr. Chin, his wife and daughter, they were all bound and gagged upstairs. Whoever did this, they were definitely trained.

 They've both got two shots to the body and one to the head. Upward trajectory. Was the killer reclining, taking a load off? Or does he shoot from the hip? VICKY: Could be. GABRIEL: Huh. It could've been a dwarf. Ha, ha. Dwarf assassins. They've been used effective too. Um, there's a Pygmy tribe off the coast of Manila, used poison darts. Ahem, Gabriel. - He okay? - Yeah. He's with us. Yeah, unfortunately. What's up with the tat? FDANNY SIGHS] - What does this signify? - I don't know. Both guys got them. Same marking, same place. Probably a gang emblem. No, it looks Eastern-European, like it's a Gypsy symbol, maybe. - You're killing me. - I don't know. Easy, Dan. Mr. Chin, I'm Detective McCartey. - This is Detective Woo. DANNY: Hey. Is there anything you can tell us about the shooter? Anything at all? CHIN: Nothing. I didn't see him. And I wouldn't give him up if I saw his face. He did us all a favor. Those guys were Aryan posse members. Hmm, they target anyone with less than a round eye... ...or a skin shade darker than an egg shell. Well, that one I recognize, because he's given me problems before. JAKE fON TV]: What kind? CHIN: Broken windows, graffiti, death threats. JAKE: Ever report any of it? CHIN: Detective, you know as well as I do... ...there are different levels of equal protection depending on your race. DANNY: Mr. Chin, here's my card. If you can think of anything else, give us a call. Aryan posse's not the symbol on their necks. Oliver Stone here thinks our high-challenged killer is a Gypsy. A Gypsy, circus, Pygmy killer. Well, it wasn't a suicide, passion or accidental. Maybe it was a contract hit. Do you guys, like, recognize the work? Like, the style of the hit, the m.o.? You've been watching too much Law & Order. Well, look, all I'm saying is if you got a leak, you call a plumber. Uh, Gabriel? That's a good point, bad analogy. SARA: I think I will go to Rikers, though. FDOOR LOCK BUZZING] FWOLF HOWLING] FSIGHS] Ever kill out of anger, detective? - Once. - Enjoy it? More than a little, yeah. This bad boy you're looking for, he kills with intent... ...with purpose. There's no joy, no exuberance in these killings. They're too economical. Recognize the work? Just the mindset. This guy's on a mission. He's definitely not enjoying himself. Not yet. Recognize the tattoo? No. FDOOR LOCK BUZZING] How is it out there? Is the world a safer place now that I am behind bars? Probably not. I hated you for putting me away. Still do. And I thank you for that. Why? Because hate feels so good. FCHUCKLES] FGROWLING NEARBY] FBARKING] FSHOUTS] - Hello, Sara. - Damn it, Nottingham. How goes the battle against the bad guys? Good vs. Evil, love vs. Hate. It breaks my heart, the ugliness you see. SARA: My glass is half full. Evil is never benign. I guess that's why they call it evil. - In some, evil is innate, they're born bad. - Okay, what can you tell me...? In others, evil is planted, cultivated and reaped. Sara, seek out the purveyors of hatred, for they bear the foulest fruit. MAN 1: Hey, look at these two lovebirds. Makes me sick. FMAN 2 GRUNTING] MAN 2: No! FSCREAMING] MAN 3: Wait a minute. FMEN GRO ANING] Top-o, McCartey. How did it go last night? Ugh, wasn't pretty. Thanks. Two dead guys were on a gay-bashing mission. They put one man in a coma... ...the other victim was DO A from massive head contusions. Seems like our vigilante, whoever he is... ...put an end to the festivities just a little too late. - Hmm, no other witnesses? - Nada. So one homicide was perpetrated by our dead gay-bashers... ...then they were killed by... The m.o. Is the same as the killings at the Chinese restaurant. What's more interesting is that both of the attackers have the same tattoo... ...as the fire starters from the other night. - You still tight with Husman in Hate Crimes? - Yeah. I'm on it. JAKE: See you. Oh, my... fSIGHS] - Hey, Pez? - Mm? Why is your friend Gabriel videotaping us all the time? Because he asked if he could and what he really wants to do is direct. Uh-huh. You know that could be used against us. You know you're being paranoid, McCartey. Look who I work with. - Get out of here and get some shuteye. - Twist my arm. LUPO: Brothers, there's a force at work... ...that threatens to undermine our siege upon this world. We must unify our clans. We must strengthen our resolve. And we must be merciless in our persecution of those... ...who would object to our goal of a new world order. Lupo, this killer somehow knows exactly when and where to appear... ...in order to prevent us from carrying out our missions. I think that someone here betrays us. Who are you to start pointing fingers? You should take a hard look at your own group. FYELLING] My group? Don't you talk to me like that. I know it's your people. Don't you... You come in here! FALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] LUPO: My brothers... ...let's not descend into small-minded tribalism. That would only ensure our enemy's victory. I had a vision of a seer, who pierces the prism of the physical world... ...a woman who could reveal the cur who dares to challenges us. A woman who could be of value to the cause. This woman is a police officer. Her name is Sara Pezzini. What will this police officer find? She will find Bola... ...the lovely one who sheds light upon the darkness. - I scored with the Hate Crimes Task Force. - Ah. Tattoo on dead guys is an Eastern-European symbol meaning lupo, or wolf. But it's also the name of the person who's behind all this. Is behind all what, exactly? Organizing the hate groups, uniting them. According to their records, this guy's also being tracked by Interpol... ...for past efforts in Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Berlin. They say he's been around a long time. Tattoos started showing up on collars in Detroit two years ago... ...and Miami about a year after that. Here, in the last four or five months. Ah, and here, there have been a spike in hate crimes... ...the last four or five months. More of them, and more violent. Same thing in the other cities. Another thing happened in those cities, some vigilantes showed up... ...started taking out guys, stopping crimes in progress. We've got no idea what Lupo looks like. And nobody's ever cracked his clan's code of silence to get any info. The clan supposedly has a pyramid structure... ...so probably only two or three people know who he is. They say none of his followers are allowed to make eye contact with him. What about the shooter, they know about him? No, nothing. But we did get some information from a wiretap... ...that might help us out. There's gonna be a big rally tonight. All your typical hate scum should be there. They gonna infiltrate it? I asked. He said it was too risky... ...that the security was almost supernaturally tight. FDANNY SIGHS] They can't risk letting Lupo know that they're onto him, we can. We might be able to get some more info on Lupo as well as the shooter. We should get there around 9. Danny. Danny Woo at a hate rally. Oh, yeah. FPHONE RINGS] Yeah, Pezzini. Oh, good. No, no, we're on it, cappy. Thanks. Well, the victim just got out of a coma. We should go talk to him. Let's do it. They would have killed us both if it wasn't for the girl. Uh, how do you mean, sir? The person who saved me was a girl with two big guns. She had a red hooded sweatshirt. She's not in trouble, is she? Well, we'll have to bring her in if we can find her, Mr. Gerleit. She is a suspect in at least three murders. She's a hero. She stopped two killers. Those men killed Howard. And I'd be dead too, if it wasn't for her. She should be found and rewarded. Uh, I understand how you feel, sir, but it's still our job to find her. Would you mind talking to a sketch artist if we sent one in? - Sure. - Thank you. WOMEN fO VER PA]: Dr. Shaw to Radiology. SARA: What do you think? He came up the Little Red Riding Hood thing because he's trying to protect the shooter. - And you don't blame him? DANNY: How can you? His boyfriend is dead. Our vigilante is killing killers. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that we should turn a blind eye. Have you ever got the crap kicked out of you... ...because you were white or heterosexual? No. Try to wrap your head around why certain people... ...might not wanna ID this vigilante. How permanent is this? Well, if you go for drinks after work, just don't spill your beer on it. DANNY: Pez. Uh, they'll make me if I take hardware. They got a better chance of killing you if you don't. I'll do what I always do. I'll compensate with attitude. I'm late, I gotta get going. Are you almost done? - Okay, yeah, that's good. SARA: Yeah? Okay. Thank you. - Be safe. SARA: Will do. FCROWD CHEERING NEARBY] FBARKING] Check 11-11. MAN fO VER HEADSET]: It's a bogus number. Repeat, it's a bogus number. You. Stop. Who are you? One of the clan. Which family you with? The Angels of No Mercy, Toronto Chapter. I never saw you before. Besides, you've got a bad number. Whoa, whoa, let me just talk to Lupo. He knows who I am. That's gonna be kind of hard, since Lupo isn't here. That's a tape recording you're hearing, Sherlock. LUPO fON RECORDING]: Eliminate the weak and the strong shall inherit. Eliminate the weak and we shall inherit the earth. SECURITY GUARD: No one even knows who Lupo really is. You wanna tell us who you really are? FYELLS] GUARD 1: Freeze! Don't move. GUARD 2: What just happened? GUARD 3: Did you see that? Just shoot her. Shoot her in the head, right now. FGUARDS YELLING AND GRUNTING] FYELLS] FSARA GRUNTING] FYELLS] Who are you? No, no, no, wait, wait. FBELL RINGING AND TRAIN HORN BLARING] SARA: Looks like some kind of a journal. JAKE: Bola? That her name? - Dimitri... GABRIEL: Uh, no, Dimitztragora. Uh, it doesn't exist anymore. It's been wiped out. Yeah. - Um, so you let her get away. - What? I didn't let her do anything. GABRIEL: Mm. Gabriel, can you read this? Yeah. It says Saint Martin's. How do you know Bulgarian? Well, I guess it's one of the prerequisites for being a ferocious autodidact. Oh, right. - Here. - Thanks. - Uh, excuse me. - Well, excuse me. Do you know how to translate ancient Bulgarian? - No, but what's he...? - We'll book it into evidence later, Jake. - Come on, let's go. JAKE: Where? - To Saint Martin's. JAKE: Of course. FCHILDREN CHATTERING] SARA: Wait in the car. - Come on, Pez. - I'll be right back. JAKE: Are you...? FJAKE SIGHS] Man, sometimes I just don't get her. I really don't. Why don't you ever look through the viewfinder? I don't like to frame reality. Yeah, right. Ha, ha. BO Y 1: Okay, come on, guys. Stop. BO Y 2: Pass the ball. BO Y 3: Throw it. Whoa, cool. BO Y 4: Nice shot. - Hey. - Hey. What are you gonna do with this footage anyway, man? GABRIEL: Well, I intend to show your genius to the world. SARA: Any of you guys seen this girl around? BO Y: Nope. SARA: Oh, okay. Well, thank you very much, I appreciate it. - Enjoy your day. BO Y: You're welcome. Why don't you, I don't know... ...go get us a couple of coffees or something while we're sitting here? FKNOCKING ON DOOR] Yeah, who is it? Gabriel? Who is it? BOLA: You have my book. I want it back. - You led him to me, I have nowhere to go. - Keep your hands where I can see them. FSNICKERS] I saved your life. You don't trust me? FSIGHS] That book is evidence. Not in the way you think it is. Who are you, Bola? FSCREAMING] Come here. Ah. What did you do that for? - Unilateral disarmament. - That's not fair. Why should you have the preponderance of fire power? Because I'm bigger than you are. Just go, go sit down. Yes, sir. Um... I'm hungry. Uh... Oh. What's this? Um, milk. BOLA: I hate milk. - Ha, ha. - Got any vodka? - Ha, ha. Don't you think you're a little young? What are you, what? Sixteen? Eighteen. Older? A lot. I'm not as young as I look. Bola is your name, right? Got a last name? Tell me about the book. Is it your journal? It's not about me. It's about him. Him? Him, you mean Lupo. What can you tell me about him? Have you ever seen him? I know what he looks like. I also know what he does. He makes people kill out of hate. And why do you kill, Bola? Save lives. You should know that. Don't you also hate the people that you kill? Lupo killed my parents. I'm sorry. And believe me, Bola, I understand. My father was murdered as well. But that doesn't mean that you get to kill. I witnessed it. And unless I stop him, Lupo's gonna keep killing... ...moving to new places, starting all over again. Where did you learn how to handle a gun so well? I practiced. There's gonna be no more killing, Bola. Help me find Lupo, then I can get you on a witness stand. You can testify about what happened to your parents. The only thing that makes Lupo suffer is failure. That's what I provide. FSIGHS] Honey, don't you see that you're feeding into it, feeding him? If Lupo loves hate, then he loves yours too. FKNOCKING ON DOOR] - Who is it? GABRIEL: It's Gabriel. I got answers on the book. - My book? SARAH: Shh. Just go, go. - Go in the back and hide in the bathroom. - Why hide? Because you're supposed to be under arrest for suspicion of murder. Now go. - Sara? - Uh, I'm coming. Ow. - Coming. I'm coming. GABRIEL: Sara? Hey. So this book you gave me is priceless. Uh, um... Uh, I was right about the language and it's a Bulgarian dialect. It's out of date at least a hundred years. Um... Um, it is a journal, only it's not about the person who wrote it. - It's about someone else. Guess who? - Lupo. Yeah. That's very good, detective. Yeah, this, uh... This chronicles his movements... ...from the 1600s all the way up until now. According to this, he was present... ...for some of the most horrific cases of genocide in history. There's mentions of the Lupo symbol in Nazi literature... ...allusions to wolf clans during the Spanish Inquisition. I mean, even the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand. Sara... The way Bola describes this, it's eerie. It's, uh... It's not like she learned about it. It's like it's firsthand. You know, like she was there. - What about her village. She mention that? GABRIEL: Yeah, Dimitztragora. Uh, Circa 1695. Like I said, the city was destroyed. Two opposing clans fought, wiping each other off the map. And get this, uh, one of the factions... ...and there's confirmation for this, one of the factions was the clan of Lupo. In fact, it was the Lupo clan that incited the whole conflagration. BOLA: It's my book. SARA: Bola. It's okay. What's she doing here? - I'm keeping her safe. GABRIEL: Mm. - Is she armed? - No. GABRIEL: Don't we need that? - She's not going anywhere. FlN BULGARIAN] GABRIEL: Hmm? FlN BULGARIAN] FlN ENGLISH] Yeah, you're right. It is. Um, would you mind if I taped you? Um, do you...? Uh, I mean, you know what this is, right? You know how it works? - You always this condescending? GABRIEL: Ha, ha. Yeah. So tell me about the journal. What about it? Well, like, how you made those entries as if you were there. - I don't like this. GABRIEL: Oh, no, no, no. Hey, um, it's okay. We can talk about something else. Okay? Tell me, what do you think about Sara? - Gabriel, come on. GABRIEL: What? She makes me drink milk, locks up my guns. But all in all, I like her. Sara's like me, special. Sometimes it's Ionely being special. Isn't it, Sara? Uh, cut. Cut. I'm... I'm gonna go get some stuff for breakfast. You want anything special? Lucky Charms. And some smokes. FGROWLING NEARBY] GABRIEL: Hey. Uh, she fell asleep. But only after she, uh, asked me to bust open your drawer... ...and give her back her guns. Yeah. - Well, anyway, have a good night, okay? - Okay, you too. - Thank you. GABRIEL: Sure. Oh, yeah, no problem. FGUN COCKS] Bola, put the gun down. You can't hold me here. I have work to do. - Give me your bracelet. - What? I know what it is and I know what it can do. Sorry to betray you, Sara. That bracelet will help me kill Lupo. I saw what it can do. Bola, I can't give this to you. This is a lethal weapon. So is this. - Why haven't you attacked him before? - I have. Many times and in many places. He's not like other men, he's hard to kill. I need that bracelet. Well, no can do. I don't want to shoot you, Sara. Don't worry, you won't. You're right. Will you help me get him? Yeah, yeah. Of course. FGROWLING NEARBY] Octogenarian Benevolent Society. Oh, man, this is... fPHONE RINGING] - Yeah? - Sara, so the wolf is at Grandma's. Uh-huh? I translated a portion of Bola's journal. FO VER PHONE] It says Lupo can be found at the Octogenarian Benevolent Society. I know that place, Sara. It's at 1122 Hegel Street. - It's gotta be a front. - Uh... Sara, what's going on? I gotta call you back. Bye. FSIGHS] FDIAL TONE] Good to see you. What exactly do you want, Lupo? Quit your day job. So I can prowl the streets, looking for innocent people to terrorize? You know it's not that simple, Sara. Hate is good for the human race. People were made for it. It's what drives them. Fanning the flame of ill will is truly a philanthropic undertaking. Do people actually buy into that pitch? In droves, for as long as I can remember. Use your special gift to help the cause. You let her go, right now with me, you got yourself a deal. Sara, you're lying. How about this instead? I kill her, before your eyes. Maybe then you, too, will taste the sweet venom of hatred... ...just as young Bola did so long ago. The agonizing screams of your father remains one of my fondest memories. And I'm sure one of your most vivid. - Bastard. - Yes, Bola, tell me. You kind of hate me right now, don't you? I have done things far worse than this, believe me. I've fed Christians to the lions in Rome. Burned a church full of people in Istanbul. Killed infants in front of their mothers in Germany. Armed African children with machetes, that they may wipe out their own kind. FMIMICS SLICING SOUND] Interesting how that works, isn't it? Young Bola's hatred brought you to me. Wielder. I knew it would. Do you have any idea how powerful a wielder brimming with hate can be? There's only one way to deal with your kind. You must be caged... ...and trained like a wild beast... ...thrown scraps of food... ...and beaten. Then, in time... ...you will learn to harness your hate, to direct it... ...how to exploit it. And then... ...I will own you. Take her away and lock her up. MAN: Come on. FBOLA GRUNTS] SARA: Get off of me. MAN: Come on. FSARA GRUNTING] FGROWLING NEARBY] FGUNSHOT] FGUNSHOT] Sara. FGRUNTS] SARA: You stay here. FLAUGHING] Ooh. You're more powerful than I thought. You ain't seen nothing yet. - You're under arrest. - Not today. FGROWLING] FSCREAMING] FGROWLING] FWITCHBLADE RETRACTS] Bola. Bola. Come here. Come here. Shh. Come here. - Okay. BOLA: It's okay, Sara. Don't hate. You were right. If you hate, his kind wins. I'm finished now. Thank you. Bola. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
