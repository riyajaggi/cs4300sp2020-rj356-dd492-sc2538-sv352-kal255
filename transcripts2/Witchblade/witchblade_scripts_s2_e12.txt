 FGRUNTS] Who are you? My pontiff's daughter. My brother's mistress. My husband's poisoner. My name is Lucrezia. Argh. Lucrezia? FSPEAKING IN ITALIAN] FGRO ANING] NOTTINGHAM: Flee, Sara. - Oof. I can't. NOTTINGHAM: Lucrezia. You can't end her life. But I can leave her begging for that mercy. Flee now, Sara.

 FGRO ANS] Now! FGASPS] No, no, no. FCROWD SCREAMS] Just let me get my wallet. I'll give you girls all the business you can handle. FGIRLS GIGGLE] FSCREAMS] Honey, I'm home. I'll be right in there. I just have to grab something from the kitchen. FPHONE RINGING] - Pezzini, go. DANNY: I need you here. 610 West 80th. Guy was stabbed in his bed so hard... ...the knife went all the way through the mattress... ... and stuck in the box spring. Where's the wife? That is the question. - Did she phone this in? DANNY: No, a neighbor did. Passed the wife walking down the back stairs crying. Wearing a raincoat over a blood-soaked teddy. Any history of violence here? No, the opposite. Newlyweds, married two months. He was a PE teacher. She was a maternity nurse at Churchill Memorial. No record, either one. Pez, what are you doing? Huh? Oh, I just can't believe that it was a nurse. She got a name? Yep. Jennifer Haley, RN. Hey, babe. You on the clock? Hey. Whoa, jeez. LUCREZIA: Nice. - Well, hello there. LUCREZIA: Hello. Don't tell me, you're bored, and you're Ionely. Actually, I'm charming. He's just horny. FLAUGHS] Well, that we can take care of. I have a room at the Crystal Palace Hotel. MAN 1: Yeah? - What's it gonna cost us? - Lf I'm satisfied? FSPEAKS IN ITALIAN] But you're not easily satisfied. Come on, sailor, try your luck. Taxi. Unbelievable. Three red-ball homicides this station alone. Eleven citywide. - The moon must be full. SARA: Yeah, but come on. CAPTAIN: Pezzini. - You find your missing wife yet? - No, APB is out. What gives, cap? Retired federal judge bludgeons two schoolgirls selling cookies. Schoolmarm performs vehicular manslaughter... ...on a crowded crosswalk. A nurse performs open-heart on her groom, all in the same night. What is up? McCartey, other type of cases that deal with this mass hysteria, get educated. - On it. - Danny, you're up first. Next call's yours. If it rings again, we break the record for murders in a single night. - Hmm. - Pezzini? Yeah? Go get some sleep. Right now? I don't think I should. You look like crap, Pezzini. Gee, thanks, cap. This thing, this murder wave, I don't think it's over. I need you sharp. If your missing nurse shows up, I'll give you a call you. Captain, l... All right. Yes, sir. FTHE STOOGES' "I WANNA BE YOUR DOG" PLAYING ON STEREO] Gabriel? Gabriel doesn't live here anymore. Actually, he doesn't live anywhere. FGUN COCKS] You're under arrest. FGUN CLICKS] FGUN CLICKING] FGASPS] Ten thousand miles of searching. Six hundred years of waiting. Dark clouds are upon us, and I intend to ride the thunder. Can you know? Can you begin to know? FGRUNTS] FGRO ANING] NOTTINGHAM: Flee, Sara. - Oof. I can't. SARA: She said her name was Lucreeshia. Lucrezia. Oh, so you know her? Yeah, her reputation precedes her. SARA: What reputation? Uh, she poisoned her husband, maybe other people too. - Oh. She do time? - No. She had connections in the Vatican. Her father worked there as the pope. Wait, you're talking about Lucrezia Borgia? Mm-hm. I came here for help, Gabriel. Look. Legend has it that there's an alternate line of Witchblade wielders, Sara. Ones who are, uh... How should I put this? Not so principled as you. Some people feel that Lucrezia Borgia got a bad rap. She was a terrific patron of the music and arts. So what? Hitler had an art collection. Yeah, he also thought the world was hollow. He also only had one testicle. So did Napoleon. Gabriel... Ha, ha. Sorry. So you dreamed that Lucrezia Borgia took the Witchblade. - And when you woke up, it was gone? - Yeah. It's obvious. She stole it. Ha, ha. That's just not possible. Since when is anything that happens to you possible? She's a time-walker, Sara. She visited you in the astral plane. I don't know how she did it. But she's 500 years dead. Yeah, well, death is a revolving door. Not for everyone, let's hope. Speaking of death, did you, uh... Did you catch the news today? - There's a murder wave. - I'm a homicide cop, the whole city... The whole country. - What? - Look. Yeah, no one's ever seen anything like this before. You wanna bet by tomorrow it's worldwide? - Something very big is going on. - No, no bet. What could trigger people across the country to suddenly go batty? I don't know. Television? Food supply? - Sun spots? - Aliens. The Internet. I know who you are. You're a cop, and I know why you're here. Um... Don't worry, I won't tell nobody. If you know who I am and why I'm here, you shouldn't go in there. Can't say it doesn't suck. But being in a coma is a lot better than being dead. I hope. Whatever it is... ...that you're dreaming about or thinking in there... ...I just hope it's peaceful. Things out here are anything but. Otherwise, uh, I'd spend more time. I do wish you hadn't kept fighting. But you had to do what you had to do. I hope that you wake up soon. So that I can get to know you. The Witchblade was stolen. Who? By you? What motive would I have for that, Sara? Uh, your new girlfriend? Aras has gone away. Far away. Further than your crooning Irish pugilist. The one who left you bereft is named Lucrezia. How do you know that? I had the same dream you did, Sara. Where would I find Lucrezia? She'll find you. Be prepared. FCELL PHONE RINGING] Hello, captain. I really can't thank you gentlemen enough. I can't remember the last time I felt so satiated. I'd give anything for a repeat performance... ...but that won't be possible now, will it? FlN ITALIAN] IRONS flN ITALIAN]: FSPEAKING IN ITALIAN] FlN ENGLISH] And I yours. FlN ENGLISH] How did you know the Witchblade would embrace me? Do you know what apocalypse means? A revelation. Let's just say I had an apocalyptic vision. A revelation. And what was revealed? IRONS: Our destiny. CyberFaust? GABRIEL: That guy who e-mails me about you and Witchblade? SARA: Yeah, CyberFaust. GABRIEL fVOICE ECHOING]: Yeah, him, CyberFaust. Who is CyberFaust? A newer version of a timeless tale. He told me to tell you to be on guard. FCELL PHONE SPEED DIALING] DANNY: Yeah, a nice one. What about it? SARA: Look, do not open that page. But see if he recently opened up a website called CyberFaust. - How did you know? - Listen, don't log onto that site. Keep the crime scene exactly intact. Have Jake check on the other killer. I've got a theory about what's going on. I'll meet you back at the precinct. See you there. FDIALING CELL PHONE] FANSWERING MACHINE CLICKS] FSIGHS] GABRIEL fON MACHINE]: You've reached the headquarters of Talismaniac. Com. Purveyors of the exotic, erotic, exoteric and esoteric. Leave a message. FMACHINE BEEPS] SARA: Hey, it's Sara. Call me back as soon as possible. It's important. It's really important. Uh, excuse me. I'm closed. Really? The door was open. No. The door was locked. Then how did I get in? Love your store. Saxon, right? Fourteenth century. Thirteenth. Um... Look, uh, if there's something I can help you with... I'm the antiquities curator for II Museo di Adore e Omicidio in Milano. My budget is more or less unlimited. You're absolutely right, the door was unlocked. Uh... What was the name of your museum again? The Museum of Passion and Murder. Tourists come to Italy for three reasons: Religion, cuisine and passion. I can't compete with the Vatican, and we're not a restaurant. Hmm. So passion is your deal? Passion is everyone's deal, Gabriel. Loving someone so completely you must consume him. Hating someone so strongly, you must annihilate her. I just paid seven figures for the sword that beheaded Anne Boleyn. I thought they used an ax. Not in her case. Henry VIII summoned a famous swordsman from Calais. It was thought he could deliver a quicker, cleaner blow. How thoughtful. Of course. He loved her. Henry's fifth wife Catherine Howard, she got the ax... ...for adultery, promiscuity, infidelity. I'd pay the world for that blade. You ever visit a website called CyberFaust. Net? Um, uh... l... I, uh... I didn't know he had a website. Uh, but CyberFaust, whoever he is, yeah, he's e-mailed me a few times. Sure. Me too. Come on, you should check out the site. Computers at both the newlyweds' and judge's show the last site checked out... ...on each one was CyberFaust. Net. I then checked the laptop in the killer's car. The last site entered on that unit was also CyberFaust. Net. In all three cases, the website was accessed at 5:55 p.m. All the murders happened before 6. This could just be a coincidence. Let's check out the site. Now? Now. GABRIEL: I got another e-mail from my misterioso pen pal CyberFaust. He told me to tell you to be on guard. Hello. What's going on, guys? Just take a look at this. Jake. Pezzini, what's up? Huh? - You have anything to say about this? - Must be some kind of a prank. It's never actually been confirmed that Irons was murdered. Come on, Pezzini. A guy like that just doesn't disappear. This is bad, when three murderers logged onto this site before their killing sprees. That is strange. Come on, captain, it's gotta be some kind of a setup. But the only people that know that we're investigating homicides... ...that may be related to this CyberFaust are in this room, am I right? Yeah. This is big. There is something very wrong going on. So I called in the FBI's cybercrime unit. They're on their way over. And they wanna talk to you, Pezzini. Stay here. Woo, McCartey, in my office. Yep. CAPTAIN: Close the door. FDOOR CLOSES] Since I'm new here, I don't know much about Pezzini. What do you guys think about this? There's nothing to think, captain. Somebody's obviously trying to trip her up. Maybe get her off the investigation. Danny? I agree with Jake. All right, you two hang tight. I want you to keep an eye on Pezzini. The feds will be here within the hour. - We'll get a statement after that. - All right. Thanks, captain. JAKE: Oh, great, she took off. My master neglected to tell you one important quality about your weapon. I don't understand. The Witchblade will not and can not bring death to anyone who's wielded it. I placed it on my wrist for one instant only. NOTTINGHAM: Will it maim? Yes. Will it disfigure? Absolutely. Will it cause great pain? With relish. But will these wounds bring death? FGASPS] The answer is no. FENGINE REVS] - Yeah, but on the Internet? - Sure. Why not? I hate to say this, Sara... ...but this is something that the FBI's cybercrime division should be on. They already are, Gabriel. But this CyberFaust could announce a new wave of contest winners any minute. Who knows how many people that could take out? We gotta get behind the curtain of this CyberFaust right away. Sure. No problem. So which one of us wants to have their alpha waves... ...scrambled into homicidal static? Hmm? The excrement's gonna hit the rotor any second. Still waiting for your big idea. DANNY: Don't have one. - So...? Have you ever known Pez not to pull through at the eleventh hour? No, but there's always a first time. We're talking about the feds here, man. Do you really think all of this is necessary? A legion of virtuous people went on a homicidal rampage... ...after one exposure of looking at this guy's home page. What do you think? Ha, ha. - I may never get this chance again. - Oh. - Uh, type. - Yeah. Typing. FSIGHS] Uh, come back safe, okay? You should go behind the monitor. No possible line of sight if this thing falls off. FSIGHS] IRONS: I've been waiting for you. Where are we? My domain. Did you ever fancy us meeting again, Sara? No. The slaughter of so many innocents. Why? My motives are as incomprehensible to you as the existence of evil. Do you still have a body somewhere, a real one? I do. But I don't really need it anymore. - Why not? - Because I have many bodies. What do you mean? I have become virtually ubiquitous... ...if you'll excuse the pun. I have found purchase in the minds of many... ...and can emerge in them at will. - The experience is quite exhilarating. - Controlling so many people from within. You see, I now have thousands of people in my thrall. I have been able to, shall I say, download myself into many brains. None of them has the slightest clue... ...and yet all of them are now capable of the most heinous of crimes. ALL: It seems that my fortunes improved... ...once the Witchblade was no longer upon your wrist. You see, Sara, with the Witchblade upon your wrist... ...you had infinite potential to win people's hearts. You have no idea how powerful you were. But once the Witchblade abandoned you, I was able to start winning their minds. You're confusing stealing with winning. Lucrezia won the Witchblade by stealing it. What's the difference? Who is she? Someone powerful. Someone whose time has come. Someone who believes in revenge, not redemption. She does make corporeal sojourns, such an evil delight. You see, Sara, you cannot beat me. So you should join me. Join me and do my bidding. Bend to my will. Allow me to dominate you. Let go. Without the Witchblade, you are powerless. FCLATTERING] GABRIEL: Who's there? - Who's there? - Outstanding work, young man. You'll be richly rewarded. I didn't do this for you. I didn't do anything for you. Are you sure? IRONS: Join me, Sara. Join me, Sara. Join me. Join us. Never! Sara. Sara. Sara! Sara, wake up! LUCREZIA fMOCKING]: Sara, wake up! Pity to find her like this. I would've relished the sport. Don't play the hero. I wanna taste you when this is over, but not if you're damaged goods. Hmm. Well, maybe we'll both be damaged. FYELLS] FGRUNTS] FGUN CLICKING] Ten thousand miles of searching. Six hundred years of waiting. Dark clouds are upon us, and I intend to ride the thunder. Can you know? Can you begin to know? FGRUNTS] FGRO ANING] Aah! Ugh. FYELLS] FGRUNTING] NOTTINGHAM: Flee, Sara. SARA: I can't. No! FGRUNTING] - Let it go. - No. FSARA GRUNTING] Did you think that I wasn't expecting you? Did you think that I haven't been preparing for you? Hmm? For lifetimes? FGRUNTING] Aah! - Let it go. - No. FBOTH GRUNTING] Mr. Irons tells me you appreciate violence. And sex. FSARA GRUNTING] Gabriel, help me pull this out. FlN IRONS' VOICE] Sara, please. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Quite the opposite. What have you done to Gabriel? He's in here. Somewhere. FGRUNTING] FGRO ANS] FSARA GRUNTS] I knew you'd come back. You're the only one that can take it, Irons. BOTH: Do you know that only a woman can wield the Witchblade, Sara? If ever the Witchblade... ...was vulnerable, uh, accessible... ...it is now in this form. FSARA PANTING] SARA: Take it. You know you want it. Yes, I do. FGRO ANS] FGASPS] FGASPS] FYELLING] FlRONS YELLING] FlRONS GASPS] How did you get it back? I never lost it. The Witchblade is a state of mind... ...and a state of the heart. My dear Irons, can't you see? This is where the real battle is fought. And you have lost. Where are we? My domain. A place where there is no difference... ...between warriors of the word and warriors of the sword. Here, they are one and the same. And, here, you... ...who are neither, are not protected by anything. Why now? Why this time? Because I am no longer angry. Hey, Danny, check this out. Looks like CyberFaust shut his site down. The feds aren't gonna get squat. Or maybe someone shut it down for him. Gabriel? Gabriel, hi. Oh, hi. Uh... Did what I think, um, just happened, just happen? Depends on what you think happened. I think I don't feel so good. Yeah. There's been a virus going around. - You should probably get some rest. - Yeah. - Uh, Sara? - Yeah? I'm glad you made it back. Thank you, Gabriel. Me too. VOICE OF THE WITCHBLADE: You know who I am. SARA: Who are you? I am the force that inhabits the stone upon your wrist. FENGLISH SDH]
