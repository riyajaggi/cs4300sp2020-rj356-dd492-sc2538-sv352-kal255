 - Previously on "LifeLine." - I got over two-and-a-half million in cash in each of these, man. Do you care to know the first thing I want to buy? It's my freedom, man. Keisha! - Where are we going, babe? - Anywhere you want. - His street name is Skinny. If he's smart, he's already packed his bags and split. If you shoot him now, it's murder.

 - My dad bought this for me? - Yeah. One last little shot, all done. - I don't want to stay here. I want to go home. - I'm sorry. - You're late. [plate crashing] I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in my house! - I'll be back to get you, little guy! - Norah! Norah! [computer beeps] [knocking] - Dugan Morris? - Who wants to know? - I'm Hal James from Social Services. You adopted Norah Hazelton six years ago. - What has she done now? - You know, I think it's best if I just speak with Norah, please. - That freak ran away yesterday, and my home has never been more peaceful. Put that in your file. - Do you have any idea where she is? - No clue. But if you find that ungrateful little bitch, you can keep her. I'm done. - Hey, did you find her? - She skipped out on her foster family, so I'm jumping blind. - Only six minutes left in your jump window. Did anyone see you come in? - I don't think so. - I put you on the disabled list. You won't come up on the jump schedule while you're gone. Don't forget she's 17 now, she's all grown up. - It's been six years? Getting closer. - Conner, you are running out of time. [Opening Music] [rap music] - This is the worst fake I.D. I've ever seen. - Come on, I -- I just need a place to warm up, it's cold. Please? - Don't make me regret it. - Thank you. - Go on. - Whoa, ho, ho. Oh, you know, there's nothing in there for you, baby. The real party's at my place. - Yeah? Is the music this loud at your place? - The music is whatever you want it to be, and the beer is free. For her. You assholes still gotta bring your own, right? What's your name? - Norah. - I'm Tom. Come with us, Norah. It's all good. Promise. - So this is the castle. - Wow. - So, uh, Tom's pretty into you. - Yeah, he's cute. - Yeah. We'll see how long it takes for him to invite you into his room to try his secret stash of craft beer. - His room? - Yeah, Tom's room. He's got a little fridge in there. - Oh, wow. Not a lot of privacy, huh? - Oh, he can turn the music up if you're loud. - He's cool. He's cool, I guess. - Yeah, he's a total idiot, but, um, he's way fun. And personally, I will take fun over brains anytime. - I mean, both would be nice. - Yeah. Good luck with that. - Hi. - Oh, God, speaking of neither. - You guys wanna come watch me lie in the street? Simon says he thinks I'm gonna flinch at the cars. - I can't believe that it took two entire people to make up just one of you. - What? - Oh, my God, leave us alone, Bleach. We're talking. - All right. But you're gonna miss out. - His name is Bleach? - You don't wanna know why. Oh, shit, Tom's coming this way, so I actually am gonna go watch Bleach get run over -- - Uh-huh. - and give you two some privacy. - Okay. - Better than a sweaty nightclub, right? - Totally, yeah. Thanks for, um, thanks for saving me. - Yeah. You dig the place? - Is it always like this? - Oh, people crash here when they need to lay low, you know? No lock on the door, no judgment. You want a beer? - Sure, yeah. - [indistinct radio chatter] [siren] - Goddamn it. Good morning, Officer. - License and registration. Donald Fredericks. There's a sign posted back there, Mr. Fredericks. No right turn on red between 7:00 and 11:00 A.M. - Damn, I, uh, I didn't even see it. - Churn and Burn, that's that, uh, gym on Birch, right? - Yeah. - You work there? - I own the place. - No shit. I'll just be a minute. [eerie tune] [gun shots] [knocking] Is it Fredericks or Frederick? - Fredericks with an "S." - The system says there's no S. - I've been Fredericks for a long time. - Must just be a data entry typo. Might want to let the DMV know. - Thanks for the heads up. - I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time. - Oh, well, thank you, Officer. Thank you. - You know, my, uh, my wife goes to your gym. Trying to get down to that high school size. - Tell her to ask for me. I'll give her some complimentary training myself, and if she's serious, she'll be a whole new woman in six months. - A whole new woman would be nice. - Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, man, I know. - Yeah well, you have a good day. - You too. You too, Officer, thank you. - Huh? - Yeah. - So, you flip the sharp side away from you. - Okay. - Always away. And then you let the weight of the blade do the rest of the work for you. - All right. So, down -- - Yeah. Yes. And then turn it and then whip the handle back in your hand. - How was that? - Um, it was pretty good for a first try. - All right. - Good. Good. Again. Yes. Whip it. - Okay. - Good. - I'll be better than you in no time. - Uh. - Good morning. Where are my lovelies off to today, huh? - We are going Christmas shopping. - Oh, yeah? Is that so? What you geting me? - Mommy, let's go! - The boss is calling. - Yeah? - Come on, sweetie. - Top of the morning, ladies. - Come on, sweetie. - Come on in, Harry. - Listen, am I being too sensitive, like, with Keisha? She doesn't like me much, right? - Keisha doesn't like you at all, man. Look -- look, Harry. I'm having an issue with my I.D., okay? I got pulled over earlier. - I mean, why -- why doesn't she like me? I mean, I'm very likeable. - Harry. - I -- I am always -- - Ha -- Harry -- Harry -- - very nice. - Harry, my I.D. -- - Did I tell you not to get pulled over? How fast were you going? - I was going slow. - Okay. - It was an illegal right on red. The officer, he lets me off with a warning, but he tells me that I gotta check with the DMV because sometimes I'm Fredericks and sometimes I'm Frederick. And it's like, hmm, what the fuck. - Okay. Yeah, forgery. It's kind of a tricky business. You know, sometimes things aren't what they're supposed to be. - I paid you a small fortune to take care of this type of stuff, right? Social Security, I.D., biometrics, but these little inconsistencies keep on popping up because you can't spell my name the same way on two different fucking forms. - Okay, okay, just, just -- look. Look at me. Stop worrying, all right? I'll handle this, okay? [electronic tune] [slow music] - Did it hurt to get these? - A little. They're the only things no one can take from me. Did that hurt? - Um, I don't -- I don't really remember. - So, you ditched your foster parents. Are you gonna try to find your real parents? - Uh, my mom had a lot of problems, and she disappeared a long time ago. - What about your dad? - He's dead. - Shit. - Yeah, I should go. - Hey, we don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. - Uh, no, it's fine, but, um, I should go. - I'm just asking you questions 'cause I like you. I wanna know more about you. - Yeah, there's really not much to know. I don't know how my dad died. I can't remember anything that happened. - Like you blacked out? - Yes, sort of. I guess. I don't know. They said he brought me along on a drug deal and tried to get me killed too. - What an asshole. - Yeah. You know what? It's probably better that I don't remember. I just want to move on and be happy. - Where you gonna be happy? - I'll send you a postcard when I find it. - Do you want to be happy here? Save you a stamp. - Do you want me to stay? - Yeah. That is the coolest goddamn goldfish tattoo ever. Yeah, that's my girl. This is gonna be dope as hell once it heals up. - Um, how long do you think it's gonna hurt for? - I don't fucking know. Should we get a tree for Christmas? - Hell no. Christmas was invented by Victorian cobblers to increase shoe sales. No. That -- that's all a racket. Now, here's how you stab a bitch. I'm gonna need you to walk slower. You ready, babe? - Mm-hmm. - Oh! Oh, sorry, bro. - It was his idea. - Yeah. It's best to move along. It's good. I am a fucking ninja. You want to get somebody got? I got 'em. - I've got somebody. - Yes? - Are you Dugan? - That's him. - Norah. I told Irene you'd be selling your ass for drugs. Looks like I was right. - Norah, we were so worried. - Hey, fuck you, lady. You don't give a shit about her. - Your friend has a nice mouth. - I want my fish. - Check the sewers. I flushed that fish the day you decided we weren't good enough for you. - Norah, are you okay? Do you need money? Do you need -- - Run along before I call the police. - I heard about you. You pick on little kids, you piece of shit. - Get out of my house, and take your little slut with you. - Oh! [grunting] - Get off of him! Tom! [grunting] Oh, no! Oh, God! [coughing] - Okay. - Yeah, Norah, do it! - I can't. I can't. - Come on! Take him out. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Come on. - No. - Oh, no. - Norah. - [moaning] - That was awesome! You kicked so much ass! - Leave me alone, Tom. - No. He deserved every second of it. - I want to be alone, okay? - Babe, come on. - Just get away from me! [somber tune] Why did you leave me? [crying] Oh! Oh, God! - Norah! Are you okay? Are you all right? - I -- I -- I just -- I just slipped. I just slipped. - Okay. Just take a breath. Take a breath. It's all right. - Who -- who are you and what -- how did you know my name? - Well, okay. Let's just go inside. It's really cold. - No. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me who you are and what you're doing up here. - My name is Conner Hooks. I was just up here checking out the view, and I saw you fall. And thankfully I got to you in time. - No, that's bullshit. - No, it's not. - It's bullshit. - No. - Because you weren't up here before, and I definitely heard you call my name. - No, I -- whoa. - It's almost like you just came -- came out of nowhere. - I am not gonna hurt you. - I'm gonna ask you one last time. Who the fuck are you? - I'm an old friend. We met six years ago. - No, we've never met. - Yes, we have. You just can't remember. - So if I'm gonna die, you'll always come and save me. - Mm-hmm. - But I need to actually die first, right? I mean, in order for you to come and save me, I needed to actually die tonight, but then you changed it? - Yeah. - So there's a version of me that fell all the way down, and she knew what it felt like to die. I feel sad for her. - No, no, no, don't. Look, it -- I changed it. You're safe. - You're gonna make me forget again, aren't you? - I have to. My company spent a lot of money to pay off the police, cover up that shootout and -- and wipe your memory. No one can know that I gave you that LifeLine, not even you. - Look, I want to remember. - No, you don't. - Norah. Norah. Where you been? I've been going crazy. I've been looking everywhere for you. - I don't know. I was -- I was drinking up on a roof and, um, it was around my old neighborhood. I'm not sure after that. - What does that mean? - I can't remember. - All right. Well, everybody's coming for the Christmas party, so I can tell them to fuck off if you want to. - No, it's okay. It's cool, I swear. - You party too hard. - Ho, ho, ho! - Oh, God. - Merry Christmas, bitches! - Oh, my God. Come on, put your back into it. What's up, buddy? Did you steal that? - No. Maybe. - Yes. - It's a Christmas miracle. - Give me a beer. - Oh, what's up, what's up? - What did I tell you guys about calling me that? Swear to God. - Should've gotten a tattoo that says that. - Tom? - What? - I thought we weren't getting each other gifts. - Yeah. No, we didn't. That came for you yesterday. - Get you some, man. - Try and get it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It looks like one of those prepaid phones that, uh, drug dealers use. - Norah, I'm gonna pour you one, all right? - Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll be there in one second. - What did I tell you guys about calling me that? Swear to God. - You should have gotten the tattoo. Let's go, let's go, let's go! [phone ringing] Who is this? - My name is Jack. I have your memories, Norah. Would you like them back? - Ew. You know, when you asked me to go on a secret mission with you, this wasn't quite what I had in mind. - Okay. One minute to go. - One minute to what? - I have no idea. Jack just said to meet here at this exact time. - You do realize that all we're about to see is this Jack guy strutting through the alley and flash us, right? - It's not like that, okay? He knows things about me. Things nobody could know. - Exactly, because he's a stalker. Seems pretty sketch to me. - Yeah. That's why I brought you. - I mean, if he does flash us, that can pretty -- - Okay. Okay, get ready. Three, two, one. - Did you just see that? - Did you? - Yeah. - Good. - Wait, no, no! What are you doing? - Let -- let go! [phone ringing] - You have to be faster than that, Norah. He who hesitates is lost. - Where did he go? - It doesn't matter, that's just the first step. A little something to show you what we're dealing with. You ready to take the next step? - I'm ready. - Next on "LifeLine." - You've been chasing this ghost for six years. Maybe it's time to let it go. - These are not the type of guys you want to mess with. - This doesn't have to end badly. - It's not possible because I don't allow it. - It's not a lie. - You picked the person to rob, little girl. - How do I know you're telling the truth? - I don't need your fucking advice.
