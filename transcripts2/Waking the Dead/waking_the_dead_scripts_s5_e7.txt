 Waking the Dead (2000–…): Season 5, Episode 7 - Straw Dog: Part 1 - full transcript 
 In 1979, Grace Foley (Sue Johnston), at the start of her career as a Forensic Profiler, assists in the arrest and conviction of Tony Greene for murder and mutilation of young men. Nearly thirty years later, Grace is called to give evidence at Tony Greene's Appeal. At the same time someone appears to be copying Greene's actions by sending a jar of pickled severed fingers to Grace. The team are sent current footage of a new victim having his finger cut off. The torturer promises that he will be murdered unless Grace admits that she was wrong about Tony Greene...

 HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS SOBBING ON TAPE Grace. Oh. Sorry. Hi. Good morning. OK? You all right? Just got up too fast. Why do you need a bag that big? I'm in the Appeal Courts today. Do you remember? If you had a smaller bag, then you'd get rid of that deformity. Yep. You're probably right. Oh, look I'll be out all day. I'll see you later. You're not hungover are you? Do I look as if I'm hungover? Don't answer that. See you later.

 HEAVY BREATHING Appeal Case Number 19035. Tony Greene versus the Crown Prosecution Service. Counsel for the Appellant, please state your case to the court. My Lords, on October the 16th 1980, my client Tony Greene received multiple life sentences. His conviction was secured by a witness statement. This witness has, some 25 years later, recanted his statement in a suicide note. It will be my intent to prove that the conviction of Mr Tony Greene was unsafe. One day, I'll get out. . . and do one. . .just for you. The first witness I will be calling is Dr Grace Foley. SCREAMING Dr Foley.

 Can you tell the court how you became involved in my client's case? Yes. I was requested by the Home Office to give a psychological evaluation of the kidnapper, what we now call an offender profile. Working with whom? The investigation team. But who was the police officer that you were working with? What was his name? Detective Sergeant Harry Taylor. Excuse me, could you tell me where CID is, please? Oh, yes, first on the left. OK, thank-you. There's always one more thing you can do, and right now we're not doing it. All right, so let's go back over everything. I want everyone traced and interviewed. I want all statements cross referenced. Yes, love? Dr Foley. Oh, right, he's here. Pardon me. Where is he? Who? Dr Foley! I'm Dr Foley. Dr Grace Foley. ALL LAUGH All right, get on with it. Right, so you're here to do this. . . Behavioural Analysis. Right. You better come into my office. PHONE RINGS Doesn't look like work, Colin! So, what do you know about the case, then? Nothing. Great(! ) Have a listen to this. HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS MUFFLED SOBBING 'No! No! No! 'NO! NO! NO!' WOMAN SCREAMS FRANTICALLY Well? What do you want to know about it? Is it real? It's real. So, er, why send it to us? It's a dialogue. Meaning? The killer is talking to you. He's telling you things. Things. What things? He has a victim. He's torturing the victim. He's in control. What did he ask for? No, nothing. No note with the tape? No. So, er, what does that mean? Let me hear the rest of the tape. OK. HEAVY ROCK MUSIC PLAYS SOUNDS OF CROWD CHEERING Well? The music is important to him. Did you check it out? Yeah, it's a bootleg of one of the acts at the last Reading concert. So it can only be a week old. Yeah. What's that about? It's a mental watermark of the event. Because? It's probably where the magic happened. Magic? The killing chemistry. When the killer and his victim meet, the chemistry between them is as strong as the love chemistry. It's a very perfect psychological fit - the victimology fitting exactly with his psychopathy. You know, when someone you've never seen before looks at you and suddenly you feel. . . Alive? Yes. The song reminds him of the first time they met. The song. . . On the tape. Yeah, oh, right. The music and the victim for him, they are, interdependent. So what are you saying, he's a musician? Or wants to be, more like. The heart moves inexorably to that which it desires, good or bad. We find his desire and he won't be too far from it. Orbiting it, or able to attain it, that's how we'll get him. We? Yes! I thought you were just here for a consultation? But you need me now. Right, you got me all figured out then? Well, you're my first one, so I'll have to see if I am right. First? First case! Right. . . He sent you this to introduce himself, to start the game. Game? Oh, sorry, I don't understand. He's a nobody and wants to be a somebody. If he does this right, it will put him up there with Ted Bundy. A multiple killer. So he'll kill again? Definitely. And there'll be a pattern. Focus on the music. You're looking for a young man, a loner who works behind the scenes, maybe a sound engineer, a lighting operator, something that gets him close to the action. Jim. Send a bulletin to all locals, tell them to stop and search anybody going in and out of live music venues. Welcome on board. Harry, by the way. Dr Foley? Yes. . . Sorry? Would it be fair to say that you had a lot invested in the arrest of Tony Greene? Since it was your input that led the police to his arrest? Yes, I had invested a lot of time and expertise. But, surely, it meant more than that to you? This is your first case, your big break? A successful prosecution was paramount for closure? Well, on the contrary, it's just as helpful to an investigation team to rule somebody out as to rule somebody in. Accepted. But let us establish for the record. The police would not have been looking for someone with his profile had you not told them to do so? That is correct. No further questions at this time, my Lord. Give the bag. . . Get off! Get off! Grace! Are you all right? Yes, I think so. Did you see him? No, no he's gone. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK, but he's got my bag and my files. Doesn't matter, as long as you're not hurt. My phone and my purse. . . Look, I'm sure once he's emptied that bag, you'll get it all back. OK, but I need a cab. Let me call you a taxi. Taxi! Bastard! Dave, have you got that report? What's this? Your desk. It's a bit. . . What? Close quarters? Don't worry, won't bite. Suppose I don't have any choice then. Problem with the lads? No, just the office prats. Ignore them. Is this a present? Yes, it's a typewriter, do you know how to use one? Bit cheeky. Unscrew the pressure cap by turning it anti-clockwise. . . That's the pressure cap. That's hot. Hi, how are you? I've had my bag stolen. . . Yeah, we know. You know? It was handed in. I put it in your office. That's the advantage of having a handbag the size of a suitcase. The poor guy couldn't carry it for long! So, what happened? He ran up the outside. . . What? What is it? Oh, my God. Gherkins? Wait a minute. . . What? Fingers. . . Fingers? Let's get it to the lab. OK, in total. . . Five fingers and one thumb. . . Six different victims. Gender? Without DNA results, I'd say young males. My God. . . It gets worse. It usually does. These four and the thumb are between 20 and 30 years old and have been preserved. . . But? But, this one was removed from a living hand no longer than a few hours ago. Hours? Yeah, it's still bleeding. OK, so we know that Tony Greene sent fingers in a jar 30 years ago to the investigating team Grace worked with. How many jars were found? The one he sent to the team and three we found in his van. Each jar containing how many fingers? Five. Five fingers from five different victims. So, there was one jar with five fingers always been missing. Yes. Check the old fingers against the ones from Greene's victims and see if we get a match. Right, that's that. The immediate problem is the new finger, OK. No notes. No demands. A hostage without demands? That's not an impossible situation, that's not impossible Spence. OK. One thing we do know? Someone out there's re-enacting Greene's MO. Yeah. Or. . . Or what? Greene is. . . What? Greene is innocent? What Spence is trying to say is that I might have made a mistake. And the real killer has come out because of the media attention of the appeal case. That might be the case, but it doesn't alter the fact that there's a kid out there. . . and that kid might be alive and we could save that kid's life. Does anyone have an alternative interpretation? Stella, do you wanna say something or throw up? No. No. Good OK. Felix would you carry on, please? OK, the victim is white, probably male in his teens. There's plenty of meat on the bone and the nail and its housing are in very good condition which would suggest he was well-fed and nourished. The nail is also well cut and groomed. Unless the guy who chopped it off gave him a manicure. . . And he could have taken off his nail polish as well( !) OK. Right now, that's all I have for you. I've sent off the DNA samples to the labs but it could take up to 24 hours for a hit, if he's in the data bank. Come on, we don't need to go there. How long have we got on this victim? There's a number of possibilities. The victim has bled to death. He's in shock and will be dead within 14 hours. Or, he survives the shock but develops blood poisoning and will be dead within three to five days. What is the most likely scenario? Well, if the victim is still alive he's not in good shape. BIRD CHIRPS Grace, do you want to contribute? It might be his own finger! Well, go on I'm listening. . . It might be a nutter who knows about the Greene case, dug some graves, nicked a few fingers and then cut his own and put it in the jar. A freak looking for attention. OK. I was just suggesting. . . No, no that's interesting. So to rule that out, we need to keep pushing the DNA cross reference on the Greene fingers. The Greene fingers, can't believe I said that! OK, Grace, you're bursting. . . Was there anything written on the lid of the jar? Yeah, I was just about to get to that. Oh, God. "If it wasn't for your stiff little fingers. . . ". . No-one would know you were dead. " Yeah. Well, that was written under Greene's jars too. . . It was never in the public domain. So only the real killer would have known that. Yeah, or someone close to him. One of Tony Greene's ex cell-mates. I'm on it. Felix would you like. . . Investigate me too. Why? Well, the jar was found in my bag. I'm the first link in the chain of evidence, that makes me the first point of investigation. Treat me like a suspect. BIRD CHIRPS I want the name and addresses of all the prisoners who shared with Tony Greene, Prisoner number 1042034P, ASAP, please. Cheers. Thank you. Are you sure you want us to do this? There's a young lad out there somewhere. How else are we gonna to get to him? Somehow the kidnapper is connected to me. I've ordered all the CCTV for the streets around the courts. I'll get a list of all court cases where your testimony helped to get a successful conviction. Yeah, then cross reference it with recent releases. I'll cross reference the names of Greene's ex-cellmates and we'll get him. Good. OK that's my password Spence, to my computer. You'll find everything you'll need on there. OK. Let's get it done. You sure you're OK with this? No. . . But. . . Good. Oh, please! Oh, God please! Please let me go! Let me go. . . please. . . Oh! Please. . . Please. . . Dr Foley, in Tony Greene's original trial you gave an Offender Profile to the Court illuminating reasons for his alleged crimes. Could you remind us of that profile? Tony Greene is an outcast in the middle of a world to which he desperately wants to belong. More than. . .anything he longed to be in a band, but he didn't have any talent. So he become a roadie. This brought him close to it, but not into it. At least, not into the part of it where he wanted to be, the stage. The fame. He eventually hated it. He hated it for rejecting him and he hated himself for not having the strength to walk away. But he knew how to get that attention he craves. Be another Ted Bundy, a serial killer. His victims? Forms of himself, other pathetic wannabes. Or what's known as 'Meat-Puppets'. And so he stepped over that line into his fantasy. And enacted it in the music world. Leading to the second part, finding a suitable victim. He didn't need to look far. Wow. . . Hey. . . Is that his guitar? As so often is the case, the victim unwittingly came to find his killer. You wanna hold it? Wow. . . Yeah. . . Presenting himself with an unconscious behaviour that met perfectly with the killing needs of the accused. Because ultimately Tony Greene knew that that's all he would ever amount to being - a 'Meat Puppet'. We tracked him down when we identified the first part of his MO. So you wanna come to the party to meet the band? Yeah! Great! You better not show me up. Hope you're cool with the blow and that, yeah? Yeah, I'm down, man. Good. Light up on that. . . If any part of his plan falls apart, then so does he. The victim had never used heroin before and took a severe reaction to the drug, which caused him to collapse. HE COUGHS AND RETCHES What? Get up! Greene can't think on the move. He panicked and made the mistake that would lead to him being found in possession of his victim. But at this point, could we not be looking at a situation where my Client's version of events stand true? He was getting the boy stoned in order to have sex with him? It went wrong and he panicked. Well, at that point in time, yes. But later we discovered. . . And in 1980, behavioural science, not to mention offender profiling, was practically unheard of! It was an emerging science! No further questions at this time, My Lord. I can't believe the Prison Record Service is still 20 years behind the rest of the world? How much is it going to cost to load all this stuff onto a computer, eh? Well, maybe it's safer that way, because then this doesn't happen. What's that? Every detail of Tony Greene's case for all to see on the web. "Welcome to Blind Justice, we record and post all details of corruption within the British Judicial System. " And there's over 100 case files posted here. Greene's is right at the top. Can you trace the IP? We can try. But they will more than likely have a dead end IP in the Ukraine. What about the quote from the lid? Not here. . . Anything else? Yep. . . Lots of stuff about the original Greene investigation and a reference to a drink-driving charge against, DS Harry Taylor? That's Greene's Arresting Officer. . . Grace was called as witness because she was. . . A passenger in the car. Sorry Grace. . . No, Spence, it's OK, I'll leave you to it. Boyd? I had Missing Persons send me over all known IC one males in the age group. I just couldn't believe there are so many. Delegate. No I want to do it. What can you hope to achieve? Well, he's got to be in here somewhere, hasn't he? Yes. Well? There's so many of them. I'm having them all printed out and put on my desk over there. OK, well I'll start with these. Fine. OK. We've got four of Greene's ex-cellmates out in the world. I've got two names of ex-prisoners who lodged a complaint against Grace. Name yours? Malcolm Sinclair? No. Robert Harley? No. Angus McHale? Yes. Terry Healy? No. OK. Angus McHale. Killed his wife and three kids in 1979. What's his complaint? Dear me. . . What's that? He claimed that Grace entered his cell and forced him to have sex with her. OK. How far did they go with that one? They logged it. Then five years later, after treatment - no wonder - he admitted it was hallucination. When did he get out of prison? Two years ago. Maybe he's having more hallucinations? Angus McHale. . . What's the other name on the list? Derek Carling. What prison? Broadmoor, 1984. It's a dead end - deceased. Yeah. But what's the complaint? A breach of patient confidentiality. He told her in confidence where he had hidden a newborn he'd abducted from a maternity ward. Grace told the police, the infant was found unharmed. OK. Let's get McHale under investigation and bring in the others for questioning. I've requested the case files from the original Greene investigation. I'm going through her personal files so we can cross reference, yeah? OK. Good. Victim profile? An abduction that's not by force, is by deception. If he was taken from the street, they'd have needed to be discreet. So. . . Deception. Yep. Which points to someone lacking in street sense. So a kid from the country? Yeah. Or a very sheltered background. Middle class kid from the country. Vulnerable. Of course, to know all this for sure we'd have to know their personal histories. Which we don't have. So? I once heard a very cruel way of segregating the kids who could be saved from the streets and those who couldn't. I'm listening. OK, look at them with a parent's eyes. Look for the ones who are still children. The ones who listen to you and trust you. They're the ones that the predator will pick. The kids that can be saved are the ones that can be taken. Ah, please mister. Please, I'm begging ya. . . BIRD CHIRPS Just let me. . . ECHOING CRY OF SEAGULLS So, if we're right, our victim is one of these. Yes. So, if we could locate each one of them and rule them out. McHale is being brought in. That's great. Have you searched his house? Made a full search of the farm and they're still going through the outlying buildings. Why is it they always have outlying buildings? They need them . To put the bodies in? Cattle? Yeah, OK. So what happened to the rest of his cell mates? They're on their way in, they'll be interviewed and DNA'd by this afternoon. Great, thanks, Spence. Your victim. Really? Yeah. What, you got a match on the DNA? Yeah. No. . . no. . . no. . . That's possible. That is possible. Yeah, his jaw's much heavier. The eyes are very good. Not like an innocent there then, is he? He was arrested. Six weeks ago for pick-pocketing in Kings Cross. The locals said he was new to the area and involved in prostitution. No fixed address. Thank you very much Felix. Brian Dunne? That's probably a false name. We've got him down as Kevin Keogh. Brown, hair blue eyes, speaks with an Irish accent. OK, get the DNA in this file over to the PSNI and the Garda Sionchana. The who? The what? The Irish Police forces. OK, I'll do it now. He's not using Greene's MO, is he? No. How do you spell Sean O'Conner. . . With an 's'. . . Is he? No, Greene lured particular boys who were connected to the music. This guy's obviously been picked for money. This is a rent boy. So, why can't he pull it off as an exact copy? Well, maybe he just lacks the social skills to seduce, or maybe he hasn't got the physical power to abduct by force. All of Greene's ex-cell mates have got the physical capability of abducting anybody by force, but this guy's a rent boy, he's paid for. This is different, isn't it? Yes, it's different. Yeah. Yet, he desperately wants to appear to be using Greene's MO. Why? To get to me. But why you? I don't know. Harley. . . Stand in front of the wall please and remove your top half. Sinclair. . . McHale. . . Healy. . . Stand in front of the wall and remove your top half please. Why? Because we have to photograph all distinguishing marks, that's why. OK. Turn around please. Wow, that's impressive. OK. That's me done. Your turn, Spence. Come, out. Your cell mate, Tony Greene. Yeah? Did he talk to you much about his crimes? We lived in the same twelve by eight room for six years. So that's a yes? Why do you want to know about Greene? I'll ask the questions. I'm not under arrest. No, you're not. I'm here helping with inquiries. I can walk out any time I like. So I'd like to know why I am here, please? He spoke to you about the details of his crimes, yes? His collection of fingers? I think I need to say, "I want a solicitor. " Whoa, whoa. Why go there if there's nothing to hide? I've got nothing to hide, but I've got everything to protect. Protect from what? From you. Me? Well, not you, but the system that you represent. We can do this the hard way. . . Dear me. Yes. I know every detail of his crimes. Sometimes he would whisper them in my ears when we were, er. . . Well, you don't want to know about all that, I'm sure. So you're both gay? Intellectual concepts like gay and straight don't exist in prison. You go in there and you're raped until it doesn't matter any more. You lose your "self", you know, you become nothing. And then from that nothing something emerges, something else. The Phoenix. You go beyond the physical into. . . I suppose you could call it a spiritual state. A kind of love. You love him, then? I love him. I hate him. It's the same thing. Why do you hate him? Because he destroyed me, made me what I am now. You know, his. I'll always belong to him. OK, so why do you love him, then? Well, the same reasons. Look, I don't think you want to have a conversation about love. OK, let's get back to the fingers, then. There's been a copy cat hasn't there? Why d'you say that? It's obvious the missing fingers have turned up, or you wouldn't ask me about them. Only someone who knows Greene would know where they are, and that's why you pulled me in. Look don't take this as an insult - it's a very blunt route one equation. No insult taken. And there is one important piece of truth missing from your sums. And what's that? I'm not one of them. Them? A killer. So, can I have my clothes back, please? Soon. Yesterday. Lunchtime, where were you? I live in a halfway house, we have a routine. Yesterday, I was cleaning the kitchen. Can anyone verify that? It's not a prison. There's no guards. That's convenient. You know. . . there's something very beautiful inside you. Interview terminated. All human beings have the right to bloom. What's that supposed to mean? To become the best we can be. Boyd. Yeah. Boyd! They've made contact. My name is. . . My name is Kevin. . . Kevin Keogh from Newry and I wanna go home. Dr Grace Foley, you are wrong about Tony Greene, he's innocent. I'm with the real killer. If you. . . you must admit that you are wrong, otherwise there'll be consequences. Is that it now, mister? What? OK. Good news. What's happened? What's your good news, Stella? Brian or Kevin or whatever, he's. . . I think we can establish that his name is Kevin. How come? Doesn't matter, what is it? When he was arrested, he wasn't alone. He was with a friend, Marius. . . Luddick alias Redser. Alias? Also known as. AKA. Bit of French there, was it? Just find him and bring him in. Right, I have to go. Where? Court. You're not in a fit state to go anywhere. If I don't go, then Greene walks. And if that happens that lad is disposable. See you later. What I don't like about this Mpeg is that it's called Number One. I'm not looking forward to Number Two. I've got them searching for a sender I P. . . That's a waste of time. We can't even trace the address of the Blind Justice website. Our kidnapper is not as clever as he thinks he is. No? No, this Mpeg is full of stuff. I can see that, but is it good stuff? Well, I'll let you know. Yeah I'd appreciate it, if you would. Thank you, Felix. Dr Foley, can you take us back to the night of January the 15th 1980 and the circumstances that lead to the arrest of Mr Greene? Yes. We knew by now that our killer was connected to music, so we alerted all units to check vehicles coming and going to music venues. Greene was stopped. When the police became suspicious, they searched the van. Is all this stuff yours, Sir? Did you load it yourself? Are you OK? We were lucky enough to find Mr Greene's last victim alive, but we never found the bodies of the others. Although we did find remains. Mr Greene liked to collect trophies from his victims in the form of fingers. Forensic examinations of the remains revealed there to be five other victims. But that's not how you first came into contact with Mr Greene. I don't understand. Sorry. That's how the police came into contact with him. Everything you're telling us here is based on third hand information from some traffic police. I asked how YOU came into contact with my client. It's not a difficult question, Dr Foley. Miss Lloyd. In your original statement, you said you were working late in the police station when they brought in the prisoner. That's correct. That was three in the morning? I don't recall, but I know it was late. I can tell you exactly what time it was. It was 3am and you weren't alone. Can you tell us who you were with at the time. . . working with? Listen, this isn't the time or the place. It's a simple question. Yes, or no? We're in the middle of a case. And when it's over? Listen Grace, you know. . . all right. You know how I. . . feel about you, it's just. . . Say it, then. Say it. PHONE RINGS DS Harry Taylor. Right, we'll come down. What is it? We've got him. Come on. Listen Grace, I think you should go home. Why? The Docs said, they're not hopeful, which is medical speak for the kid isn't going to make it. If we want to keep our man we need to nail him tonight. Then let me help you. How are you going to do that Grace? Let me talk to him. Sometimes giving people other options can open things up. We don't have to do the same old routine, day in day out, do we? Let's be different. Give me ten minutes alone with him. Five. Then if he's not signed on the dotted line, then you go home. agreed? Agreed. Tony. Aren't you gonna caution me? No. This is just an informal chat. Can't believe I finally get to meet you. I feel I know you already. So tell me, does it feel good, now it's all over? I'm not stupid, do I look stupid? Not at all. I'm actually flattered that they let me have you. I usually just get to deal with domestic abuse cases, you know, namby pamby stuff. You're my big career break. I didn't know the kid was in there. That's fine until the kid wakes up and gives evidence. But he's not gonna wake up, is he? His whole head haemorrhaged. Well, he probably wouldn't have woken up, had he not received medical help. But he will. You hope. What a boring end to it all. This should've been front page. My first feather in my cap and now. . . Well, it's like some sort of embarrassing, sexual, dysfunctional thing. What? Well, you know, abducting and raping. . . I don't. . . . . rape them. I know that. But you want to. What sort of a cop are you? I'm not a cop, I'm a doctor. I'm your ticket to a section, if you play your cards right. You see, I know you can't penetrate sexually. So, you penetrate with weapons instead. Am I right? What's it going to be like in prison being the gay rapist who can't get it up? I hope you have a child. . . and it dies. A word? Excuse me one moment. And that was the last I saw of Tony Greene. Well, until he came to trial. How convenient. I would like to point out to the court that this is the moment that Mr Greene claims that Dr Foley swapped places with Detective Sergeant Harry Taylor, who then proceeded to beat him into signing a confession. A confession which he later withdrew. I would remind the court that it actually was the testimony of his victim that put him away. A testimony that has since been recanted. Do you think he was beaten? Dr Foley, you will not have to answer that question. Thank you. My Lord. . . Ms Lloyd, this calls for Dr Foley to speculate on the actions of a colleague who sadly is no longer with us and therefore cannot defend himself. Yes, My Lord. Are there any further questions for Dr Foley? No, My Lord. You may step down. Thank you. Oh, there is one more thing. Were you and Harry Taylor in love during this time? And is that why you're protecting his memory? Ms Lloyd remove yourself from my court, otherwise I'll have a Sheriff take you to the cells for contempt! Court adjourned. So, you and Kevin? Who? Brian. Ah, Irish. What about him? We're trying to find him. Why? That's got nothing to do with you. OK. End of conversation. I'm trying to save his life. So I should give you a medal for that? Do you want me to send you back to where you came from? You don't know where I come from. You asshole! Sir, maybe I could. . . Yeah, maybe you should. What's his problem? Tell me about Irish. Excuse me. Excuse me. How dare you drag my private life into this hearing. Look, either you don't know the truth, or you're covering up a lie. You just listen to me. I sat in a room on my own with that man and there is no doubt in my mind that he is a monster. If he is released from prison, he will kill again. But I'm not arguing that. Fine, he's guilty. He's a monster. That's not my problem. It's my job to get him out. And if you didn't do your job right, then that makes my job very easy. It's just something you'll have to live with. I warn him. . . Warn him? Not to go with that weirdo. What weirdo? In the white van. A van? Yeah. I have the number. The registration? We take numbers of all the cars. Do you have it with you - the registration? Sure. Well, can I have it? Give it to me. What are you laughing at? Do you think that I stand there taking down numbers? ! You little shit! Your friend's been kidnapped and someone is cutting off his fingers. We want to get him back before he dies. You get it? You little shit! SHE SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE OK, Stella? Stella? Sir. The bit about the white van was true. Yeah? Yes. Look, I didn't know about the finger thing. I thought he went back to Ireland. I'll check the CCTV for King's Cross. Good idea. She's sexy, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Grace. Oh hi, Charles. Are you all right? What is she like? She's young. Remember what that was like? Just about. How are you Charles? Oh, I'm all right. How's everything at New Grange? Don't you mean how is my patient, Tony Greene? Huh! Who do you debrief with? Good gosh, I haven't done that in years. Maybe you should. It's an important survival tool for us. Yeah, I know. I'll think about it. Well, if you want to talk at any time in a professional capacity, I would be privileged. You're very kind. Thank you. Not really, I have the very worst of intentions. Do you nick many Marlon Brando quotes? Only the best ones. Oh, better go in case they think you're fraternizing. OK. I've got you some emergency accommodation. Don't you want it? Yeah right, maybe I go straight and be a cop like you. Don't you want to get off the streets? Can I go now? Yeah, sure. Felix has got something for us in the lab. OK. See this guy out. Come. What have you got? OK. The bed's a medical bed. Yeah. I blew up an image of something that caught my eye. It's a Hospice insignia. Saint Martin's. Can you ask them. . . ? I've asked for a list of beds that have been loaned out. So when? The Matron's doing it now. You don't really need me, do you? No, not really. Next, listen to this. 'I'm with the real killer. ' I think he spoke. . . The kidnapper? I'm trying to isolate it. What, you haven't done that, yet? No, not yet. Ah, I caught you out there! Did you get anything from Redser? Not really. I think we should move on to plan B. You sure? Yeah. Lets bring him in. OK. BIRD CHIRPS Oh, Jesus mister, please. Please! I'm begging you. I haven't done anything wrong. All I want to do is to go home. Will you please just leave me and let me go home? He's naming you at every turn, Grace. What's that supposed to mean exactly? That there's a personal connection. You must know this man. I don't. I have searched my mind! OK, tell me again. I need to know exactly what went on with Greene. Oh, come on Grace - details, just give me some details! OK. I hope you have a child. . . and it dies. THUMP ON DOOR A word? Excuse me one moment. Well? He did it all right. But there's no way he'll put his hand up for it. Wants to play the long game. Are you sure it's him? I'm positive. OK. Go home. Not now? We agreed. But. . . You heard me, Grace. Go home! You can't dismiss me like that. What the hell. . . ? Go, Grace. I don't want to argue. Just go. So he was beaten? I don't know. But you suspect it. I honestly don't know. When I look at myself back then, I don't recognise myself. I was young, I was naive. . . Were you in love with Harry? What's that got to do with anything? Everything, if you compromise your professional integrity. Are you calling me a liar? I've known you a long time, Grace, and I've been doing this job even longer. I know this much - you're holding something back. Oh Grace, please. Come on. Grace, Grace, Grace. . . Grace, come on. What? Come with me. I want you to talk to him. You're not serious. I am. I can't. Yes you can, Grace. Yes, you can. Now get in there and do it. OK, Stella, wait outside. Thank you. Spence. You know why I'm here. Grace, get out of there! What's the matter with you? Get out. Get out. What's the matter with you? Grace, when I put you in there, I had every good intention. . . I understand. . . psychologically why you put me in there, but as a friend. . . . As a friend, I wish you'd come clean with me and tell me what's going on! I mean, why does that man hate you so much? That's a bit obvious! Because my evidence helped put him away. Don't deal with that now. Talk to me! Sorry. Great. I'm sorry. I just don't want to talk about it, OK? OK. Oh, God. "This has gone to every newspaper in the country. " Put it on. What? What is it, mister? Did I do it wrong? MUFFLED CRIES MUFFLED PLEADING Oh, Jesus no. SCREAMING PHONES RING So now we're in the middle of a media storm. I've got the DNA results on the fingers that were sent to Grace. I confirm they did belong to Greene's victims. Why's no-one answering the phones? We've just had another Mpeg. PHONES CONTINUE RINGING I'll call this up in the lab. We're going to have to make a statement. No. I'm going to have to make a statement. We've got a bed list. There's over 100 names on the list. Could you deal with it, please? Yeah, right, a DA's really supposed to be. . . Deal with it! You're not going to tell them you've made a mistake? Even if you do admit you made a mistake. . . . . it doesn't mean that the boy isn't going to be killed. No, but it might buy him some time. Grace. REPORTERS SHOUT: Dr Foley! Do you believe Tony Greene. . . ? ALL SHOUT AT ONCE I'd like to make a statement. I'm speaking directly to the kidnapper of Kevin Keogh. You want me to say Tony Greene was beaten in custody. I will say this - in my conscience, I do not know whether he was beaten or not. I'm removing myself from this investigation. So stop it. . . Stop hurting him. That's all. ALL SHOUT AT ONCE I don't understand you, Grace. Don't you want to help save the boy's life? No! Yes. Where is he? You told me to investigate you. Why hadn't you spoken to Harry? Was this him? I don't know! What do you mean! Is this him? ! Do you recognise this signature? It's Harry's. He blames you, Grace, for telling Harry his secrets. But I've never met him. Kevin, if you can you hear me, stay where you are! What has he done with the boy? Kevin. . . If you can hear this. . . . . hold on.
