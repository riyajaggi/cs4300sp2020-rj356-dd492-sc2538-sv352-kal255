 Waking the Dead (2000–…): Season 5, Episode 6 - Subterraneans: Part 2 - full transcript 
 Boyd and the Cold Case Squad become convinced that Dr. Nick Henderson, an apparently clean-cut and dedicated medical researcher and respected family man is complicit in the deaths of two men after the decaying corpses are found. Michael Shrman was a millionaire businessman who was kidnapped and imprisoned in a deserted cement factory and was enabled in committing suicide. The other is Russell Tate, an unemployed loner, who was battered to death and left in the same area. Proving how they were committed and why is the task facing the team.

 'Let me out!' Who is it? Michael Sharman. What am I supposed to tell my kids? You find the person who did this, you make them explain. I'll find them. Cause of death, blows to the skull times six, any one of which could kill. The bloke's name is Russell Tate. What is Nick's last name? Henderson. Dr Nick Henderson. International Health Authority. This is very bad timing.

 This is a murder enquiry, the timing is always bad. I was at my squash club. Same partner, same day, same court for the last 15 years. The police might question you about my movements the night that Sharman was abducted. So, how's your hotel? 'It's perfect. ' I can just see Stephansdom. Sounds beautiful. That's him. And this third life's got a stage somewhere. What he does there. . . and why he does it, I have no idea. Let me out. 'Let me out!' How do you feel? 'I miss you. ' I meant about your speech. Oh, pretty good, actually.

 I was just going through it one more time. 'You'll be fine. ' I love you. 'I love you too. ' ECHOES OF PAINED SHOUTING (Shit. Shit, shit, shit!) You all right? You've been here all night, haven't you? I'm fine. What's this? Silcoset cast of Russell Tate's head wounds. I'm trying and failing to identify the weapon. You think it's going to tell you anything about the killer? Killer or the crime scene. I mean, his wounds suggest a volume of blood killers only THINK they've cleared up. You think he was hit on the head with a Black & Decker, do you? I'm sick of looking at this. I did find something. Good. Russell Tate's jeans. The ones he wears or his DNA? His jeans-jeans. Ah, jeans. What? We found some disintegrated paper in the change pocket. Nothing legible, but the ink had made an impression. That's from the pocket? Yeah. What does it say? Something ". .acement". Acement, placement, replacement? I was thinking maybe it's a receipt or a ticket? Music event, sports event. Travel? Buses, trains, we'll check everything in the days after Russell left his dad's place. OK. Thanks. You should get yourself some caffeine. ( And wake up. ) Hi. Maybe we should bring Henderson in, get Gordon Christie to pick him from a line-up? No. Why not? He's in Vienna. I want him to think we've moved on, you know? What did you get on Henderson? No internet hits, criminal records or tax history. He exists. He's got a house a wife, a car and a kid. I couldn't find anything. If Henderson set himself up as this chief medic in the ruins. . . What do you mean, "if"? Is there some doubt? We've got to take into account Gordon's medical history. He knew about the cement works. He's a raving egomaniacal do-gooder. He could also just be a very compassionate man who cared about the poor buggers. That's the kind version. He wasn't doing anything criminal. Exactly. Henderson does not have a motive to kill either Sharman. . . Russell Tate knew about his deal with Tina, from the garage. Henderson withdrew from the deal. The only link between Henderson and Sharman is that they live near Guildford. OK. Er. . . Sharman was abducted on his way from Heathrow. Yes. Henderson's work sometimes takes him abroad. Yeah. Was Henderson on his way from overseas that day? No, he was playing squash. I checked with the club. Every Monday, squash. Same partner. Dr Lynch is here. Henderson's squash partner. How can you be absolutely certain you were playing squash on the evening of Monday the 1st March 2004? We keep a record. Who won? I did. Who usually wins? Me. Nick's got ability, but he's got no vanity - doesn't care about winning. I've never met anyone without vanity. Well, I'd go further. I'd say that he's without ego. He's not only a brilliant scientist, he's a saint, and it's insane you think he's got anything to do with Michael Sharman and this other bloke. Russell Tate. The other bloke's name is Russell Tate. Are we finished? Why are you so angry? What do you mean? Are you angry with us or with your friend Nick for making you lie under caution? Any time you want to amend your statement, just let us know. Spence, have you got a minute? Uh-huh. I've been going over the CCTV footage of Sharman at the petrol station. Now it looked like he saw something or someone and went over. I noticed something, a reflection in a van door. . . See? So I cleaned it up. . . I've been waiting months to use this. There. I'll get a print out of this and get one to Boyd. Wow. Who is that? Excuse me, are you the woman that works in. . . Sir, we told you there is no Dr Henderson working here. I understand, but is it possible he is working in another building somewhere? Our directory covers the IHA globally, not just this building. Vous etes francaise? Oui. Comment vous le savez? Je connais l'accent. Dites-moi, Prof Rosenthal travaille ici aujourd-hui? Il est ici, oui. He's here today? Yes, Professor Rosenthal is very busy. Something we have in common. Is he up here on the right or he left or straight up or what? The right. The right. OK. Nick Henderson? Yes. Who is he? He's a suspect in a murder inquiry, and he claims to work with you personally and to have worked at this organisation for over 12 years. Well, he's lying. Well, that's quite possible, but I have seen a photograph of the two of you together and as far as I can tell it was genuine. In it you are shaking hands. Well, I spend a lot of time shaking hands - more than I do peering into test tubes. Have you ever received unwanted phone calls, letters, anything like that? Well, I get stacks of mail from animal rights campaigners, but they're really addressing the IHA generally. So you don't meet the public on a daily basis? No. Ah, erm. . . A couple of years ago, my wife talked me into writing a thriller. It didn't do very well, but the publishers made me work like a dog promoting it. Book signings and the like? Yes, a few people wanted their pictures taken with me. Well, you win a Nobel prize, you pick up a few fans here and there. Was he one of them? I'm sorry, I really can't remember. I recognise him. We have a small library on the ground floor, and I used to work there. That man came in every day for years. When did he stop coming? I don't know. A couple of years ago. Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup. Au revoir. How's he supported himself all this time? 12 years. I don't know. Obviously Russell Tate found out something he shouldn't have. Or he didn't know who he was dealing with? Neither did Tina. I don't think the Nick Henderson she fell in love with ever existed. Have you got your, um. . . Yep. Thank you for being so incredibly helpful. Where could he be now? I doubt he's in Vienna, and I shouldn't think he's at home. I'll run a registration check. Parking tickets could reveal something. I wouldn't hold your breath, he's been doing it for 12 years. He's got it down to a fine art. That's absurd. . . impossible. You ever called him at the IHA? Nick uses a pager, so do I. So do a million doctors. I know he works there. I have investments through him in IHA development funds. What does that mean, exactly? It means I get to be philanthropic and pay less tax at the same time. Have you seen a return on your money? It has to remain for a fixed period. Look, I trust Nick more than I trust myself. 'Directory, which name please?' IHA, Cambridgeshire, please. Which town? Cambridge. Would you like me to connect you? Please. RINGING TONE International Health Authority. How may I help you? Nick Henderson. Dr Nick Henderson. One moment, please. I'm sorry, but there's no Nick Henderson listed in our database. PHONE BEEPS OFF Satisfied? There was a call for you - Maureen from Kew? Ah. What did she say? Something about a lemon squeezer. Lemon squeezer? Yes. How do you kill someone with a lemon squeezer? Ah, no. You're thinking about one of those Tupperware jobs. I had to buy a lemon squeezer for a wedding a couple of months ago. It's a stainless-steel number, no change out of a hundred quid. Not big but could be. . . very tasty in a fight. Have you got a picture? No-one sets out into the night packing a lemon squeezer. Definitely a to-hand weapon. There's only one place you'd keep one. If they banned kitchenware, they'd halve crime. Mrs Henderson, DI Jordan. I have a warrant to search this house. Would you mind telling me what's going on? We really need to know where your husband is. I've told you, he's at conference in Vienna. What are you doing with that? We need to keep hold of this for the moment. Sorry. Have you ever been to your husband's office? No. . .why? How long has he worked there? 12 years. 12 years, and you've never been? ! 12 years. 12 years, and you've never been? ! PHONE RINGS Well, I mean we've driven past it at weekends and he's pointed it out. . . DI Jordan. Please tell me on what grounds you're here? No, I'm sorry. I can't. I don't. . . I'm not feeling very well. . . I'm. . . I'm gonna go and lie down. That's OK. Grace. There probably was a train ticket in Russell's pocket. "Probably"? Yeah. 5pm, 3rd May 2000, a derailment at East Croydon closed the line that serves Guildford West not a mile from here. So, they ran a bus service? 3rd May is the same day Russell's dad kicked him out of the flat in East Croydon. Do you expect me to believe you never once had a flicker of doubt about your friend's work? Last summer he was offered a job at a research institute in Australia and had to decide immediately, and that seemed strange. His name was not on the Medical Register. We went to medical school! Did you graduate together? Nick deferred a year. Half way through finals, he lost both his parents. How. . .did he lose his parents? They ran a pub in Gravesend, and lived in the flat upstairs. There was a fire in the middle of the night. Nick did everything he could. Nick was there? He'd gone home to revise. What were his parents like? Quiet. . .serious. The "worked hard all their lives so that their child could have what they couldn't" type. So, you think that Nick pulled out of his finals, and then retook them the following summer? Well, yes. Aarrgh! What is that, Felix? It's Re-agent Blue. It's not blue. It goes blue when it reacts with the peroxidase in blood. It's just an indicator, but a pretty decent one. Like that? Like that. Are you sure it's blood? 'Well, it's a presumptive test, 'but I also found a silver-plated lemon squeezer,' which is what I'd narrowed the weapon down to. We've got him? I can't see him bludgeoning Tate on his own doorstep. I can, Felix. I can, if he was going to expose the big lie. Yeah? All right. Thanks. If his wife WAS in the house, she would have known about this. It would've taken some clearing up. They asked me if I'd ever been to your office. Why would they ask that? 'What else did they ask you?' Nothing. OK. I want you to stay calm, all right? All right. 'I'm not in Vienna. ' I cancelled my trip yesterday, but I couldn't tell you. What? 'Why?' My team have discovered a dozen fatal cases of SARS - bird flu - in the UK. And central government are hell-bent on hushing the whole thing up. 'I'm briefing Rosenthal this afternoon, 'and then we'll go public with the full weight of the IHA behind us. ' 'So, you mustn't worry. This police visit. . . ' It's just a crude intimidation tactic, that's all. . . 'Now, I want you to take a taxi to your sister's, 'and I'll pick you up around the back in case you're followed. ' Nick. . . I'm scared. It's all right, 'just do as I say and everything will be OK, OK?' OK. Julia? 'What?' You're the one true thing in my life. 'Nothing will ever change that. ' I love you. I just want to clarify a few things, Dr Lynch. Did you see Nick Henderson on March 1st, 2004? No. . . I didn't. Finally. Finally. Is there anything else you'd like to get off your chest while we're all here? Julia knew Michael Sharman. Did he tell you that? Julia is secretary to the local primary school board of governors. Michael Sharman. . . Was a governor, yeah we know that. Did Nick Henderson ever meet Michael Sharman? I don't know. What was his reason at the time for missing his Monday squash? He said he was in Cairo, at the EU-Africa Summit. And. . .yes. . . I believed him. Yeah. Stella. I need the dates of the school governor's meetings, and details of that fire. OK. Hey! Hey! What's going on? What the hell are you doing to my house? If we don't find anything, we'll put it back. What are you looking for? Blood. What? I'm sorry, Mrs Henderson. You should be sorry. My husband is a brilliant, selfless man. You should rest, Mrs Henderson. I think I'll go to my sister's, actually, if that's all right? Thank you. Are you sure that's wise? I'm going to tag along. SCREAMING So, Henderson's alibi is down the toilet. He could have abducted Sharman? Yeah, but how did he end up at the cement works? So, he sees Henderson, he decides to go over to him and says, "Hi. " And in doing so the poor bastard signs his own death warrant. So, Sharman died for the same reason as Russell Tate. Yeah, he found him out. But Sharman didn't know it. Sharman didn't know anything. But we haven't proved a connection there. We have. Sharman was on the board of governors. And Julia Henderson took the minutes. Ah. You don't forget to mention you bumped into someone's husband the day before. Particularly when you're meant to be in Cairo. So, Henderson sees Sharman and panics. Exactly. Yes, he panics. He follows him, follows him in the car. Somehow he gets him to stop. He gets out and grabs the nearest thing he can use as a weapon. The torch. The torch. Smashes his head. But why lock Sharman up? Why not just kill him? Well, maybe he didn't have the stomach, or the heart for it. Well, he had the guts to smash Russell Tate's skull open. It's different. Tate was actively seeking to destroy him, Michael Sharman just said "Hi". I won't be long. You can take care of Adam, yeah? I can't explain now. Shit! Henderson didn't have any animosity towards Sharman, so it was harder. But he didn't, he kept him alive. He did more than keep him alive, he risked his own life by taking him food and drink. What, then he says, "Here's 50 paracetamol, kill yourself. " Henderson was keeping Sharman alive for what? For what reason? PHONE RINGS He didn't want a ransom, so why was he doing it? Yes. Spence. I lost her. She was picked up by a grey Volvo estate. - 'Henderson?' - I'm pretty sure. God, Spence. I can't believe you. . . OK, just get back here as quick as you can. Bye. What? Problem. Where were these SARS cases? South-West. Devon and Cornwall. How did you find out about them? Chap I was at Guys with saw something on his ward rounds and then called me up. Who? Andrew. Andrew Lansing. Thank you. You don't know him. Anyway, I took two IHA specialists down there and they confirmed it. And who exactly wants to suppress this? The government. I told you. They're worried about it ruining tourism like foot and mouth. And that's why the police have been round? That's right. The questions about Sharman, they're just a pretext to shake me up. But you said Professor Rosenthal's going to use the clout of the IHA to sort it out? That's what I'm banking on. Are you going to see him this afternoon? Yeah. What time? Four o'clock. I want to come. What about Adam? My sister's picking him up. Come on. You always promised I could meet the great man. You're not going to take no for an answer, are you? I want to know what's going on. And I've just told you. Fine. Fine. Let's go. He's told her something. He's supposed to be in Vienna. If you're asking if she knew about the murders, I can't see it. Why is he risking picking her up? She's all he's got left. When she knows the truth, it'll all be over. Come in. Sir, Henderson's credit card statements. Nothing much. No hotels, motels, or B&Bs.; He did book three one way tickets to Australia on March 10th last year Australia? Cancelled and refunded. About four weeks after the booking. Find out who made the reservation. Grace? Yep. What do you think Julia will do? Her instincts will be to trust him so she won't be aware of the danger she's in. Where would he take her? I don't know. He's been hiding the truth from her for years so now he has to hide her from the truth. But he isn't going to kill her, is he? Yeah. . . but he'll think of it as sparing her. Nick? Hmm. We came down this road 20 minutes ago. Did we? Are you sure? You said Rosenthal was expecting us at 4.00. It's 4.30. We'll be there in a minute. Where is his house? It's kind of. . . It's kind of on its own. But you've been there before, right? I'll have to look at the map. Where is it? It might be in the back. I'll pull over in a sec. Nick? It's not here. Look. . . Why don't we just. . . ? Just grab a coffee? We've just had a coffee. Professor Rosenthal's not expecting us, is he? 'Let me out!' I hear you lost Julia. We have this "I told you so" thing in this unit. So, anything here to tell us where they might be? Nothing that I can see. How about these? It's just utility payments - rent, all beautifully inscribed. Except these ones. Hmm? Take a look at these. What? Here. He messed up, I do it all the time. No, no, no, no. When he messes up, he does this. And these blank stubs on either side. . . Mmm. Looks like the cheques were written quarterly. Let's cross reference with some bank statements. Give me some cheque numbers. Have you lost your job or something? No. Of course not. Then what is it? It would be irresponsible of me to tell you in your condition. Fine. Don't walk away from me. I don't know who you are any more. Don't say that. Don't say that. My work, my research, everything I've achieved, I did it for you. What are you saying? I want you to be proud of me. I am proud of you. Then don't leave me. You've got to tell me the truth. Do you love me? No matter what? Of course. I'm on compassionate leave. I have been for six months. I didn't want to burden you. It was just after we found out you were pregnant. Burden me with what? I've got cancer. Cancer of the stomach. I know, I know. I know I should've told you. I've only got a few months left. . . I don't believe you. I know, I know it's hard to understand. . . I don't believe you. I know, I. . . Julia? Julia! Julia! Julia! Darling. . . Darling, are you OK? Darling! HE SOBS BREATHLESS GASP Ah. Ah, my head. You took a bit of a tumble, but you'll be all right. I should see a doctor. You already have. I'm keeping a keen eye on you. OK. The fire that killed Henderson's parents was treated as suspicious. Who did they go after? Some bloke with a GBH conviction. I don't get this Australia thing. Nothing about Henderson Jr? He wasn't a suspect. He was at home though? BO TH: Revising. For his finals. He completed his first exam the day before the fire. I'd like to see that exam paper. See how he got on. Are you saying the pressure made him kill his parents? It has been known. Ah, you've got the cream. SPENCE: Henderson's been renting an allotment for five years. Where are we going? We're meeting Rosenthal here. Come on. What is this place? A safe house. Well, a safe shed. Have you been here before? Oh. . . No, I can't say that I have. I want to go home. We will. Very soon. What's that smell? Hmm? Nick? You hit me. No. No, don't you remember? You slipped in the car park. You slipped and fell. Right. Yeah. Nick. . . Don't! The baby! Please, please, please, please, don't be scared of me. Don't be scared of me. Why didn't you let me take that job? I needed to know more. But why? Because it would have meant moving to the other side of the world. But we'd be safe now. Nick, please. . . I want to help you. Help me? I can smell gas. It always smells like this. I thought you'd never been here before. Nick? Help! Help! Open up. Henderson, open the door. Police! Open the door! Open up! Come on, open up. Police! All right, all right. Come on! Open the door. Open up. Come on. Out! Nicholas Henderson, I am arresting you on suspicion of murder. Come On. I'm sorry.  Julia, it's OK. Nick! It's OK. Mr Henderson, will you state your name, address and occupation? Dr Nicholas Henderson, Rose Cottage, Hanlye Lane, Guildford. I am a senior researcher at a German pharmaceuticals company. Until recently, you worked at the International Health Authority under Professor Rosenthal? Yes. For how long? 12 years. How do you explain the fact there is no record of you having worked there? That's called airbrushing history, the Russians were rather good at it. And you aren't the one doing the airbrushing, Dr Henderson? You're not a doctor in any shape or form and you never have been. You pulled out of your exams, said that you were going to retake them. You never did. I'm sorry, this is ridiculous. Your pregnant wife has a head injury. Were you responsible? No. She slipped and fell. I'm going to show you some pictures of Michael Sharman. . . and Russell Tate. I'm sorry, I can't help you. Just look at the pictures! FELIX: 'Boyd, I need to talk to you. ' Excuse me. The re-agent I used to check for blood, it's only indicative. In what sense? It reacts to anything with a peroxidase content, but that's a very short list. But whatever you found is on it on the list. Horseradish. Horseradish? Tons of it, soaked right into the grouting. So, Russell Tate's blood is not splashed all over Henderson's kitchen floor? We'll never know. If it was there it's been cross-contaminated. It's worthless as a sample. Henderson's either very lucky or very smart. He's probably both. I'm sorry. It's all right. Shit. Shit. Right, your friend, Dr Lynch, Jonathan, placed ?16, 000 in your trust, money you were going to invest in the IHA development funds. Is that correct? Yes. Why is there no record of this investment, except in the form of a deposit in your. . .current account? Um. . . it was because I put the money into an IHA account. No, because you stole the money and then you spent it, yeah? Is that not right? Dr Lynch is outside and he would like to talk to you. I don't want to speak to him. Why is that? Because he looked up to you for years cos he thought you were at the IHA, when in fact all you were doing was pissing away your time in their library. Shut up. Ah, a real moment, eh? Still, it beats hiding away in an allotment shed, doesn't it. . . Doctor? I'm sorry. How long do I have to sit here and listen to this? You'll sit here for as long as I want you to sit here. He might be one of the all-time liars and dissemblers but all he's got to do is sit there and he walks. Yep. His wife's our only hope really, isn't she? You know, if we can convince her, perhaps she can convince him. Right. You think it'll be that easy? What the hell else are we going to do? OK. So ,if she's in denial, which I have no doubt whatsoever she is, she's only going to want to hear the truth from him, not us. OK, so if she wants to see him then we agree? Yeah, but. . . Julia Henderson is coming in from hospital. Thank you. Also a Professor Wallace from Guy's returning your call. Thanks. Who's he? I'll tell you later. So, we're going to have to prime her. How do we do that? We're going to have to bend the rules just a little. What, you mean you're going to lie? Oh, you've got to win her trust. OK, OK. 'Of course that's where he works, I've been to his office. ' You're deceiving yourself, Julia. You saw a window. From your car. We've checked back to 1980. Your husband never worked at the IHA No, this is ridiculous. I want to see Nick. Well, you'll see your husband, when you've started to co-operate with us a little, Julia. You knew Michael Sharman through your job as secretary to the governors at St Luke's? When did you start working there? 1998. During that whole time, your husband never met Michael Sharman? No. What, not even just saying hello? No, not that I remember. I don't believe you. Is this where it all started? Sorry? Sorry, I don't follow. Well, apart from your name here, your answer sheet is. . . blank. Your Professor, Professor Wallace, says you were under an awful lot of parental pressure. He kept thinking you were going to have a breakdown all the time you were at Guy's. My parents wanted me to do well, and I didn't want to disappoint them. OK. So the next day, you went home. Did you tell your parents about the exam? I don't remember. But sooner or later you'd have to tell them, wouldn't you, because a blank page is a fail? And no matter how well you did with the rest of your papers, you were never going to catch up. No. Well, I expect you wanted to explain to your father, didn't you? Yes. So, Saturday night, you went out, had a few drinks, summoned up some courage? I don't remember. You couldn't do it, could you? Couldn't do it to him. . . . .so you burnt down your parents' home, rather than disappoint them? No! No, I didn't. What was he like? Michael Sharman? Very nice. "Nice" doesn't say much to me. He was, he was a breath of fresh air. Is that unusual in the world of governors? Yeah, he. . . he once suggested that all the kids be made to smoke crack to put them off it, because it was April the first. How did you feel when he went missing? Shocked. Like everybody else. Shocked? Shocked? I was upset, all right? Oh, good. In fact when his family sent flowers to the wife, I was the one that picked them out and wrote the card, and suggested we spend more than a thirty measly quid. It was a terrible thing. Yes, it was a terrible thing to happen. Julia, for five weeks Michael Sharman was trapped in a cage, the flesh ripped off his hands, all right? How do you think that felt? My husband had nothing to do with this. You're deceiving yourself. And it's. . . What? . . laughable. . . Laughable? . .that you're suggesting he did. You are deceiving yourself, Julia. Killing your parents didn't get you off the hook, did it, Nick? Julia, Jonathan Lynch, and your peers to worry about. You were in no fit state to retake your exams, and you couldn't tell them the truth even if you wanted to. I can see how much this is costing you. I can see how tired you are with the lies. I know. I know you mean well. Russell Tate was a heat of the moment thing. Michael Sharman - just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's funny. Even though I love my line of work. . . . . if I had my time again. . . I'd like to specialize in weather systems. Weather systems? People used to think that they could predict the weather. All you needed to have was a fast enough computer, and to have the equations absolutely right. Don't do this, Nick. But with true chaos weather, equations aren't enough. No system, no matter how many variables you assign. . . The chaos just stretches the tiniest error, amplifies the most infinitesimal mistake, until you're left with nothing. Is that where you are? Nowhere? We've all had days like that, haven't we? You make one small mistake, and because of that, you make a bigger one. You leave your wallet by the bed, then you go up to get it, you trip over the rug, you break your leg. The next thing you know, you're in hospital with a fatal infection, just because you forgot your wallet. You're talking about yourself? No, I'm talking about weather systems. Here. Thank you. This is the torch your husband used to incapacitate Michael Sharman. Have you seen it before? It looks like a hundred other torches. I didn't ask what it looked like. I asked if you'd seen it before. It's a very simple question, it just demands a very simple answer. Have you seen it before? The answer is either yes, or no. No. I don't believe you. This is Nick's torch, isn't it? Yeah? It was in the glove compartment of his car and then one day it went missing, yeah? Look at it! I don't remember. God, I'm trying to help you, Julia. How's your head? I fell. What happened to your head, Julia? I fell. That's not what the hospital think. Tell me. How did you hurt your head? I'd like to see my husband now. Come on, Julia. Please tell me, what happened to your head? I'd like to see my husband, please. OK. Next time you give her water when I tell you to give her water. Julia denies Henderson ever met Sharman. OK. Do we believe her? How can she defend him after what he's done? She got a glimpse of the truth and it scared her. What about Tate? Surely she'd have heard? He was travelling Tuesday evening, May 3rd. She had a school meeting. First Tuesday. You sure she had the job then? Started in '98. Boyd, I pulled this off Henderson's computer. Looks like a job offer to himself dated last March. PHONE RINGS Australia? March 27th. That's what the flights were for. Mary Sharman's here. Get Mary Sharman into the interview rooms. Get Henderson into the cells and get Julia in here. What pretext? No pretext. No pretext. . . but we haven't charged him yet. Why not? It's possible that we won't be able to. Why? Because we haven't got enough evidence. Do you think he's guilty? I'm going to ask you a question, Mary, and I want you to think very carefully before you answer it. Do you think he's guilty? Did your husband, Michael. . . Did he ever mention meeting this man, Nick Henderson? If I said yes, would it help you? I can't answer that question. Why can't you be honest with me? You promised me you'd find the man who did this to my husband, and you have, and you know you have. What am I supposed to tell my children for the rest of their lives? Did Michael ever mention meeting Nick Henderson? No. . . he never mentioned it. OK. OK. All right. Thank you. Nick had met Michael Sharman. I introduced them. When was this? It was a couple of months before Michael went missing. We bumped into him in this car park behind Guilford High Street. And the torch? Adam gave it to him as a birthday present. He asked if he could borrow it a few months later, and Nick said he'd lost it. Adam was so upset. . . He's seven. Michael. . . Michael died because of me, didn't he? Because. . . Because Nick thought that he'd tell him that he saw me? We believe so, yes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Julia, although these things strengthen. . . We need Nick to confess, Julia, and we don't have much time. You want me to speak to him? Yes. We believe that if he knows you know, he'll give up and we need that to happen. OK. You were going to make a trip to Australia. . . What happened? DOOR OPENS Take a seat, Julia. Julia, are you OK? You'll get a chance to talk to her in a minute. This is how we found Michael Sharman. Hands worn to the bone. . . where he tried to claw his way out of the place. . . that you'd put him in, Mr Henderson. Right now, everybody thinks that you're an evil, sadistic killer, even your wife thinks that. But I'm not, I'm not. You were so inadequate, that these feelings of inadequacy drove you to kill Sharman because he was successful. You wanted him dead. That's what everybody thinks. That's what I thought until. . . Till I read this. You know what it is. Read it. "Dear Dr Henderson, "our panel have decided that given your hugely distinguished record, "we do not require you to come in person for an interview. "However, if you do intend to accept the chair in viral sciences, "we will require you to accept immediately and be ready to take up the post on April 10th, "which we appreciate is only a fortnight away. "Please let us know your decision at your earliest convenience. " "Eastern Australia Institute of Medical Research". There's no such place, is there? Hmm? Is there? And then I thought, "Why is there this urgency about this job offer," you know, "this fortnight away, now or never thing, why?" Then I realised that you had a plan, didn't you? You actually had a plan to save Michael Sharman, didn't you? To tell the police where he was after you'd disappeared to Australia with your family. That's why you put the food down there, you even bought tickets. It's a crazy plan, but it had a nobility about it. You were prepared to risk everything. . .to save him, because it was hell for you, wasn't it? Going to bed every night, knowing that he was in the dark, dying slowly. You get to kiss your boy goodnight, his little boy was lying in bed alone, crying, wondering what happened to his father. It must have been hell for you, cos you're not a monster, are you? No. No, you're not. And the day you were forced to cancel the flights because Julia wouldn't go to Australia, that must've been a bad, bad, bad time for you. Almost as bad as the time that you had to drop the bottle of paracetamol tablets through the grill, so that Michael Sharman could kill himself. That must have been the worst. . . absolute worst moment of your life. I didn't want to hurt him. I know. I know you didn't. You just wanted to put him down there. You were deferring, putting off the decision. You were just waiting while you could work out a solution that would please everybody, including your wife. You. . .wanted to save him, didn't you? You would have done, wouldn't you? If I'd have, if I'd have agreed to pack up and leave with you. . . Nick, tell me. Please. . . No! It wasn't your fault! It wasn't your fault! I'm so sorry. Are you confessing to the murder of Michael Sharman? Yes. Russell Tate? Yes. I just wanted things to stay the same. I just wanted you to love me. I love you. HENDERSON SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY That's everything from Henderson's cottage. So what should I be looking for? Anything that might explain Nick Henderson. OK. Home movies. Let's get them transferred. 'You make one small mistake 'and because of that you make a bigger one. 'You leave your wallet by the bed. 'Then you go up to get it, you trip over the rug you break your leg. 'The next thing you know you're in hospital with a fatal infection. 'Just because you forgot your wallet. ' Subtitles by BBC Broadcast - 2005 Conversion by reirei.
