 Oh, my God! Stay here. Even after Martin Raynor became Martin Peterson, he still got a nail through his head. We visit the same night he's found dead. Coincidence? What are you saying?  Just saying. Hi.  Hi. He's been going through these numbers - all the Claytons. Would you, er...? Yeah, leave it with me. Thanks. Sophie, I believe you were with the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. What made you leave? We told the other police officer.

 That your father was stealing from you, so you gave it up. Yes. That was a bit extreme, wasn't it? That's how she felt. Was it? Is that how you felt? I... I... I would have imagined that must have been very difficult. Yes, it was. I bet you still would like to play. I bet you really miss it. Yes, I miss it. I... The time will come when she will play again, but not yet. The Lord will let us know when. Is that what you believe, Sophie? Yes. Really? Crawl all over it. I want everything. Fingerprints, blood, sweat - I'm looking for a DNA match to a previous crime scene, so I want it all. Is that clear? Understood. Someone was trying to contact the son of an Audrey Clayton. That'd be Neil.

 Does that make Audrey about 90? We don't know. It could be his wife. Or his sister. ..Yeah. No. I'll stick to forensics. 'Until he had the full details, nobody should draw any conclusions. 'In the London area, an 81-year-old man was found murdered last night in a local authority nursing home. 'A spokesman for the council said that they were assisting with all police inquiries. 'They will be looking into the level of security at all similar local authority properties. 'The police have as yet not released any details of the murder until all relatives have been informed.' 'Here again is an update of today's headlines. 'After winning a High Court battle...' Oi. HE MOUTHS Keep the change. Do you know anybody called Martin Raynor...or Johnny Mann? No. What about George Western or Norman Taylor? I'm not sure... No. Mrs Davis, I believe you are withholding information that could help us get to the bottom of what's happened. Now, was William known by any other name apart from Davis? Well? What was his previous name? I don't know. So he did have one? Leave us alone. We've been through enough. What have you been through? What have you been through, Sophie? I didn't understand it. What? Sophie! Sophie, WHAT didn't you understand? Sophie, this is for us - just us, and God. He will judge. He didn't change it by deed poll, so he probably adopted another name. Same as Raynor did to Peterson. I'm certain Davis isn't his real name. The men didn't want to be found. Whatever shattered that family, the mother is hiding behind her trust in the Lord to put it right. Her daughter hasn't the same blind faith she has. Yeah, well, she's a fragile little thing. Well, use it, Grace. Lovely manners. Yeah, they're all through. Thanks. Damaged left cheekbone. Hasn't healed properly. I can't put a date on it. So, they're all in the infantry division of the 7th Battalion of the Lindfield Regiment. Enlisted in 1942. They served in North Africa in 1943. Then Raynor, Taylor and Mann saw action in '44 in the Normandy landing. Yeah, but George Western also went to France. Yes, he did, but as a non-combatant conscientious objector. His job was to collect ID tags off the dead. If Western was excused active service on the grounds of conscience, the others were not of the same mind. You mean, because they fought, they weren't conscientious objectors? So, this is not a band of brothers united by any political stance. Ah. So, is this the moment when we're not sticking to it any longer? I think... I think you could say that this is the moment. Yes. A-hem. Could the others have turned on Western, and, in turn, he was avenged? He may have had an ulterior motive for not fighting, you know, apart from conscience. One perception that we've had of these men so far has been as victims - as victims of some fanatical serial killer, but what if this serial killer is a killer of...serial killers? Blimey. My head's spinning a bit now. Do you mean the...revolving door? Well, he's collecting ID tags. Is he collecting anything else? I'm not with you. Watches, jewellery, letters. Is he writing home to the dead men's family, friends, girlfriends asking for money, food, favours? Did he do that? Is he killing off the wounded? Is he letting them die? Is he selling identities? It's not my notion of the Dunkirk spirit. Where does "All's fair in love and war" come from? War is the perfect opportunity for people on the make. That's appalling. So, are you saying that Western may have been a front for some black-market, grave-robbing gang? Why not? If you're gonna deserve a nail in the head as punishment, then this is about as socially and morally reprehensible as you can get. When you think how desensitised we've got to violence through the media. These guys - they're experiencing it first hand. So you can sort of see why... they would lose their sense of morals and social sensibilities. You can understand how they could feel they could exploit the situation to their own ends. But...these guys didn't come back rich, did they? After the war they all seem to have led pretty normal and decent lives. I mean marriage, family, homes, jobs... Fish Shop?  Fish Shop. Oh, Mel. Oh-h-h! Sorry. Do you know a Neil Clayton? No.  Never heard the name before? No. What about this Internet guy? What about him? You're not being very nice to me, are you? Who is he?  I don't know. Those messages were very intimate. The messages arrived. They were never signed. I told him nothing. You turned up before I could. But he wanted to know about a Martin Raynor and a Johnny Mann, right? And I don't suppose you've ever heard that name before either, have you?! Yes, I have. Oh, you have(!) A-ha! A positive.  Great. When? May I? These are photographs of my grandfather's barracks, which are derelict, but still standing. Look here. At the end of the corridor. How did you know I needed this? OK. A drawing. Yeah. "Let us do the talking. "Taylor, Mann, Raynor, Griffiths and Western." Five names. ..We've got four men with nails through their heads. We know that Taylor's dead... Raynor's dead... and Western is dead. So...Davis, if that's his real name could be Griffiths. Or Johnny Mann. Or Johnny Mann. Can I help you, sir? Sir?! Police. Did you get it? Nah. He insisted he'll only talk to you. That's OK. I've got to see Frankie first. Where is he? On the left. Mr Brackley. Ah, Superintendent Boyd. Yep. I'll be two minutes, OK? I'll be right back. Cause of death? Asphyxiation. I'd say someone turned off his oxygen and he choked to death. At least this guy was dead when the nail went in. Yeah. ..Anything else? Raynor. Davis. Are they clean? I went to the working men's club where Taylor was murdered, and I extracted a sample of tissue from a hole in the floor that matches the original crime-scene notes. The sample turned out to be brain tissue, and this... ..is a cast of the hole. So, this batch of nails was forged at the same time. Well, it's too close to be a coincidence, isn't it? So, the same person did the killing, or... ..someone who had access... to these...nails. Frankie. What? Just "Frankie". Mr Brackley, as nice as it is to see you... why are you here? I want to know whether you've found Martin Raynor or Johnny Mann yet... Or Johnny Mann. Why don't you go home and leave this case to us? Leave it to you? Yes. The upholders of law and order(!) How many serious offences have you just pushed aside and conveniently forgotten about? Thousands, no, millions of crimes, which the police just can't be bothered to investigate properly. They never have! Nothing's changed. Nothing's changed. MR BRACKLEY SOBS DOOR SLAMS Griffiths was a friend of Western and the others. Do you know why he changed his name to Davis? I didn't know he had until you told me just now. I went to your old barracks yesterday. There was a drawing on the wall of Western and the others, with the slogan "Let us do the talking". Is that still there? It was from a poster of the time. It showed this big artillery gun, and the slogan "Let ME do the talking". It was about being careful who you talked to. National security and all that. Then, someone drew those five and changed the slogan. Why those five? TUNES PIANO I just thought it might be quieter here. You know, away from things. Away from my mum, you mean. TOOLS CLINK Go ahead. FOOTSTEPS RETREAT It's a bit different from how I remember it. Most of the 7th Battalion were afraid of them. They enjoyed putting the fear of God into people. Enjoyed?! This is their place. Lots of the men had a tough time in here. These men...had a reputation? They had the reputation for being animals. I knew Taylor in civvy street. He came from a tough family, but he was OK until he teamed up with George Western. What was Western like? A good soldier. So were the other three. They were all good soldiers. They wanted to get to the action, do the right thing for King and country. So...what happened? North Africa. What happened, Edward? I saw Private Johnny Mann kill this panzer commander. Mann took a gun to his head and forced him to strip. Then he took this young German's photos from his wallet... his wife and two kids. Open your mouth. He shoved one of the photos in the man's mouth and lit it. He said if he dropped it... he'd blow his brains out. Of course he DID drop them, Mann...pulled the trigger... ..but the gun wasn't loaded. The German was terrified. Mann said...he didn't want him spawning any more German bastards, so... ..he took a bayonet and sliced off his genitals. Then he left him in the desert... ..to bleed to death. Did you report this? That was...just the beginning. When we got back from Africa, there were no Germans, so they started on the new recruits. Somebody must have complained. Someone did. A young soldier. Benson. Kenneth Benson. They decided to teach him a lesson. They hung him up from the hoist. JEERING BENSON GROANS Come on. Strike him. Who's next? Let US do the talking. Then after using him as target practice, they just left him there. He was...in hospital for six months. Then he was discharged - unfit to be a soldier. But he was on their side. War makes you do funny things. You either cave in, not being able to take the horror, or... you embrace it... make it part of yourself. It's in your blood... ..and the more you participate, the more you know you want it to continue. We...could've stopped it. We SHOULD have stopped it. Bye-bye. Hi, there. DS Jordan again. Wonder if I could have a word with you. Pop inside. I'll make a cup of tea. I thought I was in love with him. A boyfriend? He was a lot older than me. A lot older. But I didn't care. And your mother didn't approve? She didn't mind. She was 20 years younger than my father. And she liked him. So, what did she have a problem with? I became pregnant. Oh, I see. No...you DON'T see. I found out he was my brother. My father's son. When I told my mum she just... She just went to pieces. What would God do to us? We were going to be punished. But you didn't know. I was being punished for sleeping with him in the first place. That's God's way. No. No, it isn't. I had... I had to have an abortion. And...that's against everything that we believe in. Taking a life. Is that the reason your parents split up? No. ..There was something else. Something else she wouldn't tell me. This, um... This half-brother... what was his name? Neil... ..Clayton. 'We have a name for the man who spooked Frankie. The car was registered to a Neil Clayton.' Did those five guys ever threaten or bully you? You only bully those that you know won't fight back. George Western became a conscientious objector. That's right. What was that all about? Realisation. Of what he was doing. What he MIGHT do. CANNON FIRES MILITARY MUSIC Here's my boss. Oh. CANNON FIRES Hi. Go easy on him, Boyd. He's had a rough day. What do you take me for? I'm just saying. Hi. Edward Atkinson. Great. Would you like to go inside? Whatever you want to do, Mr Atkinson. More comfy. Does the name Audrey Clayton mean anything to you? Yes, I remember Audrey Clayton. What was the connection between her and Martin Raynor? He knew her. Was he, you know, seeing her? Screwing her, you mean? She was married. Her husband was in the Merchant Navy. So you're saying that...she played around while he was away. In '43 only whores played around. So, what are you saying exactly? I'm saying that he knew her, that's all. Why would Raynor get in contact with Audrey Clayton's son? I don't know. I think you do. I don't. You're not hiding anything from me, are you, Mr Atkinson? Because if there's something you're not telling us... There isn't. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. I said go easy. I hate it when people hide things from me. You always think that. You're paranoid. You should talk to Grace. She hates me. I have the results from both crime scenes. I've now just got the lovely job of cross-referencing all the DNA samples taken from Davis's Cottage with those found at the nursing home, so PLEASE don't bother me. OK? ..Thanks. Oh(!) Two... IN A LOW VOICE: Why are you here? I want to know how reliable you are. I made a vow to God. What you have to realise is that God is the only person you can trust. God has nothing to do with this. You're wrong. It's about commitment. Commitment to your mother... and commitment to God. Now stay away from me. You don't like me, do you? I don't like your methods. My methods?! Griffiths' daughter had nothing to do with this. She didn't deserve to be punished. Johnny Mann. Tell me about Johnny Mann. Could he be dead? No. When I mentioned him to Griffiths, I knew he wasn't. They keep in touch. Trying to keep tabs on me. Trying to find out if I was getting closer to one of them. Well, one... ..major satisfaction is knowing that they lived their lives in fear. SOCOs have gathered a harvest of 80 DNA samples from Davis's cottage, and 30 from around Raynor's body in the nursing home. Now, I've cross-referenced all the results and we have a match at both crime scenes. One from a cup at Davis's... and the other from Raynor's skin. A bead of sweat on his cheek. We're looking for a male Caucasian. So, unless Davis and Raynor share the same personal trainer, Frankie, this is our man. NAILS our man. I wasn't going to say that. This is one fit pops if this is the same guy who killed Western in '48 and then Taylor in '61. But each crime has an identical 9in nail through the right side of the temple, staking the head to the floor. Yeah, but it's not hard to copy. Except that this is a personal execution. Why wait nearly 60 years? Everyone went underground. There was enough... Raynor's nephew at the fish shop said his uncle spent 30 years in New Zealand. Why did he come back? Maybe he thought it was safe to return. Maybe he thought the killer was dead, or had forgotten. Who knows? But he came back, didn't he? Came back. Mmm. Injuries to the earlier victims suggest a violent struggle took place, whereas in the recent deaths, one was drugged and the other deprived of oxygen. So, that either suggests that the murderer became more calculated or he doubted his physical ability. He got older. What would you have done if I hadn't found Griffiths first? I'd have kept on looking. I would never stop looking. You didn't recognise Griffiths. What happens if you can't recognise Mann? I'd recognise him all right. How can you be sure? I see him in my sleep... ..every night. He can't escape God's justice. DOOR CREAKS LOUDLY "And it now being put into her heart to kill him... "She was persuaded by the effect it had upon her, that it was God, "not filling her with a malice and revenge, but a concern for the glory of God and the interest of religion. "She took a hammer in her hand and smote the nail into his temples as he lay on one side - "these being the tenderest part of the head in which therefore "a nail pin might be more easily driven. "She smote the nail with such force that she drove it through both temples "into the ground on which he lay." Judges, chapter 4. And the story is that this woman lured her victim into a false sense of security. You know, she gave him comfort, shelter, food, drink, and then when he fell asleep - bingo. When he fell asleep? Why would you sedate someone? It's going to take time to work. Do you sit there and talk to them? ..So all our four men have strayed from the path of righteousness and become enemies of God. It's possible. So, what are we looking for? A fundamentalist who believes he's God's executioner? PHONE RINGS Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Um, I need to find a nail manufacturer who uses a particular stamp or hallmark... Well, I've got a J surrounded by a circle. Come through. Thanks. We bought Jepson's out 15 years ago. Well, they WERE quite unusual. They were nine inches long - made of high-carbon steel. These are the records that were left. Fantastic. Do you mind if I have a look? Help yourself. Thank you. Listen to me. This isn't a hoax. I know you want to find me, and I'm just letting you know where I am. I shall be at the Gaumont... and I know you know where that is. Be there in an hour. Just got to nip to the bank. Will you keep an eye on the shop? You won't be long, will you? No. Ian, you do enjoy it here, don't you? I love it. You know I do. Well, from now on, it's yours. Don't be silly. No, it's yours. I've had enough. But... Now go. I got the results back from the DNA swab I took from Clayton when he freaked me out. What did he do? Well, he just touched me there. Davis and Clayton are not father and son. OK. What are those? Manufacturing records of nails. You don't have time to go through those. I'll get Spence on it. ..Hi. I need to get hold of Grace. I'm in the lab. All right. Thank you. I can't talk to you now. I'm sorry, but this is really important. I need to know everything you know about Audrey Clayton. I have an appointment. You'll have to come back later. This has nothing to do with anybody else. This is between us...and the Lord. I'm not interfering with that. You must handle what happened however you can. I wish... I wish Sophie hadn't told you. Mrs Davis, this has nothing to do with Sophie. Now, all I need is Neil Clayton's address. And if we give you his address it'll start all over again. It'll be in the newspapers, on TV... It'll never leave us! It doesn't have to be like that. She slept with her own brother. Do you think people will forget that? Do you think God will forgive it? MOBILE RINGS Sorry, excuse me. Hi, Boyd. Mm-hm. ..Very good timing, thank you. I have some news. Our labs have just confirmed Neil Clayton isn't William's son. But he told me he was. No. He's NOT your half-brother. But... But why would he say that? Why would he tell that to me? To cause you pain. To cause your family pain. But... But I never hurt HIM. I never did anything to him. But...your father did. Mr Clayton, police. Could we come up and have a word, please? I was just going out. It won't take long. Sure. Er, press the bottom buzzer. First floor on the left. Sure. What did he say? Bottom one. BUZZER Oh, shit. What? Bloody service buzzer! Clayton! Clayton! Stop the bus! WHISTLE Stop the bus! Police! Stop! Stop! Go, Spence. Stop the bus! Stop! ..Stop! Stop! Stop! Police! Stop! Police! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Police! Stop! Pull over! Pull over! Pull over! I should kick your arse! I need a doctor. You'll get one when you tell us what we want to know. I know my rights. So do I. I'm in agony here. Well, you shouldn't have jumped, should you? 'What's your mother's name?' Mother Teresa. Get me a doctor. Answer my question. I want my lawyer. Make up your mind. D'you want a lawyer or a doctor? What's your mother's name? Audrey. All right. Audrey. I didn't kill anybody, all right? I was just... Just riding on his shirt tails. Enjoying the moment. Whose shirt tails? My mother lost her life because of those men. I was four years old. Why did your mother commit suicide? They destroyed her life... ..they destroyed my life... '..and they destroyed his. 'Who are you talking about? The priest's.' He was giving up everything for her. Everything. You know what? I admire him. Nails, nails, nails, nails, nails, nails... Screws... HE MUTTERS 'Who were those five men? 'Griffiths was one of them.' Is that why you set out to find him? Adam Western had started the whole thing up again. And you'd taken no interest in it before that? No. I kept myself to myself and just blanked it out of my mind. 'Got wrapped up in academia. 'Finding Griffiths was just a challenge at first.' To prove you could do it? To prove all this studying could have practical results. I'm writing a book about it. Oh, really?! After Western, Griffiths was forced into hiding. He left his job, but he couldn't leave behind the wages he was owed, so he gave them a forwarding address under the name of Davis. Davis. So, it was simple. I have a double first from Oxford. So, when you found him, you killed him. No. I don't have the stomach for that sort of thing. I was far more subtle. I seduced his daughter. Very satisfying. So, you had nothing to do with the murder? I told the priest where he was. Who is this priest? Is he looking for Johnny Mann? Are YOU looking for Johnny Mann? Look, either charge me, or let me go. TABLE CLATTERS 'Jesus!' Sorry. 'Bastard.' Take him out and let him go. Hi, Ian. Is your grandfather back? Er, no.  Do you know when he will be? Sorry. You can never tell with Granddad. Can I be of any use? No, it's fine, thank you. DS Silver! DS Silver. Sorry, I'm losing it. He asked me to post this for you, but as you're here... Thanks. "Dear Miss Silver, "you won't see me again." Is everything all right? Yeah, it's...just some information I needed. Thanks. Bye. "I've gone to keep an appointment with my past. "By the time you and your colleagues read this, "40 years of anguish and injustice will have been settled. "Although certainly violent, this end comes with a sense of peace. "Given my age and the nature of the memories, this day cannot have come quickly enough. "I write this to save misunderstanding. "When I was a young man, I was more accomplished at letter writing, "but the telephone changed all that, I suppose. "My vanity would like this letter to be prosaic, but my crimes forbid it. "There is nothing eloquent or pretty about what happened. "I am digressing. "Audrey. That was her name." JAZZ BAND PLAYS You need to see this. Nails - 9in. "The Church of Our Holy Mother, Great Waltham." It's the priest. There's something else. This is the list of all the men still living who were in the 7th Battalion. This is how we traced Edward Atkinson. This is the roll call drawn up in 1945 of all the men who were killed or missing in action. According to this list, Edward Atkinson is dead. So if HE'S dead, who has Mel gone to see? "Edward Atkinson died 6th of June 1944. "I was next to him when the bullet pierced his helmet. "I took his ID tags. I don't know why. "George Western knew him, so reported him killed in action. "1948, after George was murdered, "I took Edward's name. I had no family, so there was nobody to explain it to. "I just rang up and told them they'd got their facts wrong. "I was Private Atkinson and I was very much alive. "I had the ID tags to prove it. "After the war there was a lot of confusion. I was the least of their worries." He's going back to where it all started and where it will end, "our palace of pleasure and source of pain". He means the old Gaumont on Flood Street. The letter's like a suicide note. Boyd, you'll get there quicker than me. OK, Mel. Boyd. Neil Clayton is the son of the murderer. The DNA match is conclusive. I'll pick up Clayton. Do you need backup with Atkinson? No, I think I'll be OK. DOOR SLAMS WATER DRIPS LIVELY JAZZ Thank you for the phone call. The last time we saw each other, Audrey was alive. MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH (Not a move. Not a sound, OK?) Get off her! You made me watch. You animals made me watch. No-o! No-o-o! You keep watching it! No! INAUDIBLE SPEECH "We raped her...Audrey. "We took her back to the barracks and we raped her. "All five of us in turn." She had nothing left to live for. 'She couldn't bear the sight of her little child.' She didn't know... which one of you was the father. The... endless remorse I've felt over the years could never wipe out... the torment that Audrey must have gone through. Do what you have to do. Excuse me. Tell me, when you hammer the nails through the heads does it go through with just one hit, or do you have to...? Do you have to hammer it home a few times to get it to go right through the skull? You have a very morbid imagination. Not really. I just want to know how long I've got to get to you. Not long enough. Leave us alone, please. So this is God's justice, is it? Yes. I made a vow to God. I deserted him once but never again. This is God's law. I'm sorry. I don't trust yours. Who judges you, then, Joe? Oh, I will be judged. But what you're doing now and what those men did - it's the same thing. It's horrific. I mean, this is not a solution. They made me watch. I couldn't do anything. I was helpless. But what would Audrey think? Joe...you've been looking for me for over 60 years. I'm the last one - Johnny Mann. Is this what Audrey would want - to be raped, and then watch the one man who showed her any compassion just throw it all away? I mean, if you kill him now, Joe, there's no redemption for you. At least it would be finally over. She was my hope. She was my refuge. They destroyed a beautiful, young, innocent woman. Who loved her son very much. She never wanted him. She was raped. The DNA is conclusive. Mmm?  He's your son. What? Neil Clayton is your son. Yours and Audrey's. Oh, n-no. Yes. N-no. Joe... Mmm? ..do it. Do it... ..please! Joe, please. No. No more. (In the sight of the Lord...)
