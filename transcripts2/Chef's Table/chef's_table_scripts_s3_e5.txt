 [Tim Raue] Some weeks ago, I was talking to my fiancée. We had some of the first discussions about life and... and what we're expecting from life. I told her, "I need to be successful." And then, she called me egocentric. And then, the first thing I said, "Why? Why egocentric? That is not me." And I looked for the proper meaning of the word. I saw it means you build your own universe in which you are the center point. And it's 100% how I live, how I am. [chuckles]

 I am egocentric. [laughs] And I'm proud of it. [opening theme playing] [in German] All right, let's go! [indistinct chatter] Finish everything, so we can start arranging everything. Chop-chop! Don't think. Just do what you're told. [in English] Tim has always been one of the most, um, insisting... No, insisting is not the right word. [in German] Come on. Come on. Take it and then chop-chop. Come on! Pull! Pull! Pull! Move your fucking ass and bring me the palette knife. [in English] Tim is one of the most... [takes deep breath] tense...

 No, let's start again. That's crap. [in German] Look, guys! Stand like this! Nothing else. -[in English] We do it again. -[Ursula] Well... He can be an arrogant bastard. He is not mincing his words. [in German] Take the plate. You come here with the plate. You put the plate right here. Okay? [Ursula] Tim is not against a little controversy. He likes being provocative. It doesn't necessarily make you the most popular chef. But if Tim Raue didn't exist for Berlin's food scene, you'd need to invent him... because he represents so much of what Berlin and food is all about. [Dr. Stefan Elfenbein] Tim is perceived in other parts of Germany as controversial. But of course, Tim is a typical Berliner. The Berliners all... We're always seen as difficult, different. So the way he acts is strange. But it is very much Berlin. [Ursula] Tim has always been totally ambitious and very outspoken. And that has certainly been hard on a lot of people around him. But I think that's due to the way he grew up. It must have been really hard for him. Tim grew up in Kreuzberg, one of the toughest parts of Berlin. It was considered a neighborhood where you would not go. He fought in street gangs. He had hunger sometimes. He was a street kid. Now, he has become the best chef in Germany. [Julien Walther] The image that's associated with fine dining in Germany is a very stiff atmosphere... and classical French cooking. Tim wanted to make something different. He was one of the pioneers to use Asian flavors and put it in a fine dining restaurant in Germany. His wasabi langoustine displays his ability to surprise you. When you eat the langoustine, the flavors are so spicy. It's like... Tim punching you in the face. [Stefan] Tim is one of these icons and beacons of Berlin. You can understand Berlin through his story. He's the most important chef in Berlin by far. [in German] It tastes like nothing. It's not going to infuse the fish. It has to be hotter. It's too sweet. You can't taste it. It's cooked well, but it's missing the oomph. [Tim in English] When I entered the kitchen... I was nothing special. I was one of thousands. What I learned later on is, if you have a thing which makes you one of a kind... people are interested about you. At the beginning of my career... I made the decision that it's better to provoke... and to overdo it... than to be average... and have no one recognize you, no one want to write about you. [in German] Nothing. Not hot at all. Not hot, guys. [in English] Of course I want to provoke. Yes. It is my personality. I'm not the one who's sitting in the corner, is silent. [in German] You have to pay attention. Really! It sucks when everything tastes like nothing. Then our food will become irrelevant. It tastes like diet food. [in English] Sometimes, I'll overflavor because I want to provoke. No. [in German] A little bit more. Twice as much as you have already used. It has to burn. [in English] I want to awake the people. "Here's Tim. I'm different. Look at what I'm doing." I want my food to really stand out from everything what they have around the world. It's my way to express myself, to express my personality. [birds chirping] [Ursula] About 130 years ago, Berlin was the fastest-growing city in the world. People moved to the city from all of Europe. And they would bring their food, their recipes and their preferences with them. That's when the whole food culture really, really grew. [indistinct chatter] Berlin in 1930 was, maybe next to Paris, one of the big food cities in the world. It was an exciting time. [airplane engines whirring] But the war changed everything. Berlin was destroyed. And then, the Berlin Wall went up, and Berlin was cut into pieces. It was locked away. It was an island in Eastern Europe. And there was no way to get fresh products. And so, Berlin was not about food anymore. When Tim Raue grew up there, the Wall was still up, in the '80s. He grew up in one of the toughest parts of Berlin, in Kreuzberg, which was surrounded by the Wall on three sides. So it was locked away. And there was not even an idea that this could change. It was a dark situation in history. [indistinct chatter] [Tim] Hello. Hey. In the age between three and nine, I was growing up in the poorest part of Berlin. I was living with my mother, who was really in poverty. My mother was a nice but intellectually-limited person. She was not able, really, to care about a child. So, in the age of nine, I went to live with my father. And... the problems began very fast. My father struggled with his job. He became really aggressive... and starts to abuse me. He did that sometimes twice per week, sometimes daily. I went to a hospital several times, or to the doctor. I was bleeding out of my ears, from my eyes. I was nine years old. My father was beating me. I was alone. And at that time, I used my pocket money... to go in the supermarket and to buy myself food. It was an escape from my ordinary world to a place where I only had... the taste, the smell, the textures of food. It was like my own universe. The place where nothing can hurt me. [in German] Three zanders. Hurry up. Table eight! Just take it. Table eight. Chop-chop! [indistinct chatter] [Stefan] It is considered a very tough school to go through Tim's restaurant. The way he talks to his chefs can be rough. [man in German] Caviar is ready. I don't give a fuck. Just make the fish. [Stefan] But he is an incredible leader, and it needs clear language to lead. In Berlin, we have the term Berliner Schnauze... that means you openly say what you think and you do what you think you have to do. Berliners just don't think about a certain politeness. They think about the honest communication in that very moment. [in German] What's missing is a lot of salt. [Stefan] If he has a chef, a young chef, who thinks he is wonderful, but he isn't... well, he certainly immediately knows that. Tim tells him. [in German] It tastes a little weak. [Stefan] But at the same time, he has created incredible chefs. Some of the best chefs in Berlin. [in German] Very nice! -Now bring it to a short boil. -Ja. [in English] It is really important to me that people can trust my word. If I hire a chef, it is mandatory that I give him a handshake. That is our contract. And after that, I will take care about you. Whatever happens. Sometimes I can be really mean... [mutters indistinctly] ...but I'd never cheat them, never betray them. I'm very straightforward. [in German] It's very good. Those two just need a little guidance still. Thanks. [indistinct chatter] [Tim in English] Before I moved from my mother to my father, I was really nice, I was charming. I didn't steal at that time, I didn't hurt anyone else, I... It was nothing bad, what I did. But after these years of being abused... something changed. If you give violence to a child, if you hit them, if you beat them, you cannot imagine what that makes. It is like a nuclear bomb. I had so much hate, and it was growing, and growing and growing. I was not able to handle it. That was when I became violent. At that time, I became part of the street gang called the 36 Boys. It was a bunch of guys searching for fights to see who is tougher, who's leading the pack, who's leading the city. We was fighting with other gangs, was beating people. It was doing robberies. I was seeking for violence. I was seeking for the moment where I can bring someone down, can break him, and feel like I had control of my life. If I hit someone with a fist and it's not working, I would take the chair, take the bottle, whatever it takes. Bring him down! I was really a fucking evil, mean boy. So, from the victim... I transformed to the one who was the criminal... was the aggressor. [indistinct chatter] Many Germans have a difficult relationship toward food. Which means they do not focus on the food itself. In Germany, everything that goes beyond getting nourished... good ingredients, flavors... they are often regarded as unnecessary. So, when it comes to fine dining restaurants, people want the experience. They focus less on what's on the plate. They want to experience something really special. The classic fine dining experience. They want to explain to their friends afterwards that they have been offered, uh, 20 different varieties of... of bread, different bottles of water, that the service fulfilled every wish. Tim is one of the first chefs who stripped off all those things. [Stefan] Restaurant Tim Raue is a fine dining restaurant. But you have to put it into perspective. It is fine dining in Berlin, in a Berlin style. They have the dog underneath the table, and the servers wears jeans and sneakers. It is a different atmosphere. It's not a temple anymore. Tim created his own universe... because he never cared about rules. [indistinct chatter] -[chuckles] -[speaking in German] [laughs] Muci, remember when we used to eat kebabs? They never looked like this. We've all improved, too. [speaking German] Are there any special ingredients in it? Including Turkish peppers? Only the best. That's the truth. [Tim in English] Some of the other guys in the gang started to become professional criminals... doing armed robberies, selling drugs. But some of us was smart enough to realize that's impossible to do that for the next ten, fifteen years. I was sure then, I have to learn a job. I have to do something. I have to work. [indistinct chatter] [man] Okay. Next! [Tim] In Germany, after the tenth grade, you go to a center where they ask you questions, and at the end, they offer you three jobs you can do. And for me it was gardener, painter, or chef. -[speaking indistinctly] -[laughs] And I had no idea what that means. But I loved to eat. And I said, "Okay, yeah. Let's go for trial days." In the earlier days of my apprentice time, the teacher was standing in front of us, and she said, "Today I want you to create your own dish." And I was like, "Okay... [sighs] What are the things I like?" I teared a sheet of paper. I love figs, so I was writing down "figs." There was vinegar from Italy, called aceto balsamico. That was something very special and luxury, so I write it down. We had a pastry chef who showed me how to caramelize walnuts, which I loved from that moment on. And the next week in the school, the teacher brought to all of us the ingredients we was writing down, so everyone was able to create his dish. I was the first who was ready. It looked awful, but then everyone comes around to taste it. And the teacher was like, "Wow." He said, "The fruitiness of the ripe figs, the crispiness of the walnuts..." He said, "It's amazing." Everyone who tried it said, "Wow, fantastic." And I said, "Okay, that must be a talent." I realized that I had the chance with food to break out of my normal life, and get as far from the street as it was possible. [indistinct chatter] [Tim] Mmm. [in German] So, now you can all take a minute, and I'll teach you how to fillet a fish properly. What normally happens is you cut away the stomach flap and then pull out bones. There's nothing to say against this per se, only that it's not interesting to us, because what we want is located here and here. That is the pure fillet. This is why, at one point, I developed a way to cut up the fish in such a way that it works for us. [in English] At that time, I started to look for a job... and I was really full of ambition. So I applied as a chef to restaurants in five star hotels. I didn't get any response of them. Then I tried to do it in some proper restaurants and four star hotels. Also didn't get any response. And after three months, nothing came back. I didn't know really why. I was really frustrated. [in German] And we have a perfect white fillet. [in English] And then the human resources manager of a five star hotel... she invited me to talk. She told me, "I think you didn't get any responses." I said, "No, why you know?" And she said, "The reason is you're from Kreuzberg. You're from a no-go area." I didn't realize that anyone was looking about that. I thought if they see me and if they let me work, that they'll know I have ambition, I have passion, I'm a strong person. But they said, "You will never get that. No one wants you. You have to find a really shitty place... where they really need people and they're willing to work with you." I wanted to be in a Michelin star restaurant. But a lower class restaurant was the only way how I could start my career. [indistinct chatter] [in German] Like this? [chef] I don't think we've ever arranged food differently. Except for the dots. Those sometimes get bigger or smaller. Depending on how salty Christopher's dashi turns out. Did I put too much salt in something again? [chef] As always. [Tim in English] I started to work at Châlet Suisse. It was a low-level, Swiss-themed restaurant. In the kitchen, there was a lot of aggression. There was pressure. There was hate. There was tension. It was like on the street having fights. At the beginning, I had no talent for cutting anything. I had no skills, but I was able to fight. It is a competition. You can win or lose. And I'm there to be the winner at the end of the day. In the kitchen, the way to climb the ladder is that you start as commis chef, the next is demi chef, then chef de partie, junior sous chef, sous chef, and head chef. Hey, good morning. When I was a commis, I wanted to get the demi chef position. So I looked at the guy who was the demi chef, and I fucked him. The whole day. I was earlier than him. The jobs he did, I made it faster. I went to the head chef and I said, "Oh, I saw you get the onions from the demi chef, but don't you think I cut nicer?" [speaking in German] [in English] Colleagues didn't like me, and they was right. I was the biggest pain in the ass for all my colleagues. Hi, Paula. I did everything for power, because power showed me that I was able to go as far from the street as it was possible. [in German] Not bad! [in English] I wanted to survive. I never wanted to go back where I'm from. [in German] So, a beautiful good morning, gentlemen! [speaking in German] [in English] That makes me become a head chef in the age of 23. I was the one who was standing in front, announcing the orders, telling the others what to do, when to do. I was the toughest. I was the strongest. I was leading the pack. [in German] Let's think about... [chef] Mmm-hmm. ...what we could do with the salmon. It looks like we could make sushi or sashimi out of it. [chef] Mmm-hmm. [Stefan] Around 2003, Tim Raue was putting things together nobody ever had put together. Imagine you have a lobster together with beets from the fields out of Berlin. He wanted to prove what he can do. [Tim] Mmm-hmm. [Stefan] Because he wanted to show his identity. [Tim] Mmm-hmm. [Stefan] It was new. It was bold. But it didn't really work. -[in German] What was that? -That was papaya with this. [Stefan] Food critics looked down on him because the food was strange to them. This was when fine dining in Berlin was traditional French cooking. So as much as he wanted to discover who he is... it was a shocker for most people. [Tim] In Europe, you have the guide called the Gault Millau. Gault Millau, for me, was really important because they can decide who was really the best chef in Germany. At the end of the year, the guide was released... and it said, "This guy, he thinks he's the greatest, but the dishes, they're totally overspiced. He thinks he's really creative... but... it's more or less shit, what he is doing." I wanted to be a great chef. But they didn't understand my way of cooking. I realized that if I want to become bigger... I had to change something. [indistinct chatter] [Tim in German] Today I'm serving foie gras with matcha green tea. Please go ahead and try it. Many thanks. [Tim in English] I was cooking at the Swissôtel. At that time, I was not self-confident with what I was doing. [indistinct chatter] So I asked myself, "What are the really successful chefs doing?" At that time, German chefs tried to cook French fine dining with some German influences. So I started studying that kind of cuisine. [in German] Have a good service. [in English] Any euro I had, I spent for cookbooks, for fine dining magazines. I soaked everything in. I was working 16, 17, 18 hours per day. I didn't watch any TV. I didn't know anything about the world. It was just cooking. [Stefan] At that time, Tim developed his food, and it got subtler and subtler. And at a certain point, Tim Raue started to become big. [Tim] At the end of the year 2006, I got a call from the editor of the Gault Millau. He told me that... they will award me Chef of the Year. I was one of the youngest to ever get that. It was a point where I had everything what I want. The restaurant was packed. We had a Michelin star. Everyone thought from the outside view, everything is right... but I was not happy. I didn't know what it was, but there was still something missing. [indistinct chatter] [speaking German] What is the special taste in the dish I had earlier? [chef 1] That's a secret. [speaking German and laughing] Okay. [chef 2] You should try this. It's shrimp. With or without shell? You can eat it in the shell if your stomach can take it. It's crunchy. -Mmm! -[both speaking German] [Tim in English] At that time, I had my first trip to Asia, and went directly to Singapore. It was the first time... that I went in a restaurant which was fine dining with Asian food. It was like... How can I say? From nothing to paradise! Singapore was the capital of progressive Chinese kitchen. There was a lot of chefs mixing the traditional Cantonese way of cooking with flavors of Thailand, with products from the West. And the perfection of the Japanese way. I went to a restaurant where I ordered the steamed cod... served like a Chinese steamed fish dish, but on the top, there was a Thai-style mango salad. It was sweet, sour, crispy. It was like a roller coaster on my mouth. I was so amazed, I ordered that dish four times. It really blew me away. After the fourth day, what I understood was, the French idea of cooking, it's not me. It is harmony, all the dishes has to be balanced, and... I don't have that harmony. I'm not that kind of balanced. And it was a moment of awakening, because it was so new. The spiciness, the fire, the aggressive flavors. I thought, "Yeah, that's me." When I came back to Germany, I was still doing a mix of Spanish avant-garde, French fine dining... And I saw my restaurant, and I said, "Fuck... I have to do something completely different." I decided to kick out all the shitty French fine dining idea. I create my way of cooking. Louder, more present, provoking the guests... to go over their regular borders, what they have about taste. I wanted to take Asian dishes served in a modern way... and I give it the Tim twist. [Julien] In Germany, people normally associated Asian flavors with, uh, going to a Chinese restaurant, and not fine dining restaurants. So, opening his restaurant was a risk. [Tim] People around us, friends and the journalists, they said, "Oh, why are you doing that? You're so great. You're so successful. The restaurant is fully packed, and why you want to change?" And they cannot imagine that we will be successful. I thought, "Give them all a fuck, and change it." The Asian food was much more fun. I loved it with every detail of my body, my soul, it was... it was me. [Stefan] Tim, he did not only create his own universe, he created a completely new style of cooking. At the same time, he had an audience. And the neighborhood he served had changed. There was all this influx of young people... and they enjoyed food. There was suddenly a light coming into the city which didn't exist before. The Berliners realized, "Wow, food is exciting." And so it started that Berlin turned into a city with this reputation of having crazy food. Berlin took off. It was a new Germany. Tim Raue was one of the people to make Berlin the most exciting city, food-wise, in Germany. [Tim] In the last years, Berlin really turned around. Now, it's really a lively, vibrant place. If I describe Berlin today, it's like me. It's rough. It's hard. It doesn't please everyone. On the other hand, if you really look behind that... there is good. I am part of that city. It's my home. It's the place I belong. The main restaurant, Tim Raue, that is the heartbeat of my life. Everything is like I want it. Every detail, every glass... every dish. It is me. I create my own universe. If I walk in the restaurant, that is the most successful moment for me... because I see that I was able to control this bad energy... and turn it into something which is beautiful.
