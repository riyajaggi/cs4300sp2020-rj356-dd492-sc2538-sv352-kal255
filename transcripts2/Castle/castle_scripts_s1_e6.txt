 I'm moving back. Back to new york? I miss it. I miss it. i miss alexis. i miss you. Uh, what about your career? Oh, l.a.'s changed. Uh, the juicy roles just aren't there For an actress of my caliber. I need a change, like broadway maybe. The legitimate stage. yeah, but- Time-out, hey. Meredith, hold on, have you really thought this through? What's to think about? You, me, alexis-all living in the same city- It's gonna be just like old times. -==http://www.ragbear.com==- áéêéãîì½ µúò»¼¾µú6¼¯ Starring nathan fillion Vic's an african-american male, Early 20s. Multiple stab wounds, contusions on the arms and torso. The body was discovered by a homeless guy. He was beaten, maybe tortured. Looks like some kind of ritualistic killing. you think? Hello? You okay? I had sex with my ex-wife this morning. My first ex-wife-meredith- alexis' mom. And she's thinking about moving back to new york. Do you know what that would mean to me? That would be a very special brand of hell- The hell of a deep-fried twinkie. a deep-fried twinkie? Yeah, the guilty pleasure that you know is bad for you, So you only do it once, maybe twice a year for the novelty. But a deep-fried twinkie every day is- castle! What? crime scene. dead body. little respect here. I don't think he can hear me. okay, how about a little self-respect then? Fine. check out his mouth. There's probably a little pouch in there. How did you know? open it. What does it mean? It's vodun. vodun? What, is that some kind of "star trek" thing? No, dude, it's a religion, Practiced primarily in west africa. What? i read, too. The, uh, blood in the bowl- most likely animal. Part of the ceremony. The pouch is an offering to the spirits, But i don't recognize the symbol. well, if you did, you'd be a suspect. So how do you know about all this? research for my sixth derrick storm novel. "unholy storm." yes, thank you. And, uh, vodun's not just limited to west africa. It's also practiced by haitian and dominican communities Right here in new york. have c.s.u. run the pouch. have an m.e. test the blood. And let's get his fingerprints in the system, See if there's an i.d. this ritual-i assume then It was done for a specific purpose? that's only if you're assuming That the guy doing this was rational. no, no, she's right. It might not make sense to you or me, But, uh, if we found out why he did this, We might find your killer. yeah, that's kinda how we do it. Do you still have the research? as a matter of fact, i do. "the purpose of their rituals "was to make contact with the spirits "and the spirit world, to gain their favor through sacrifice. "storm was pretty sure he'd sacrifice anything "when he saw the amulet swaying rhythmically back and forth Between the woman's bare, glistening breasts." "unholy storm"? you dragged me in here So that you could read from your own book? Hey, there's a lot of good stuff in here, And some of it is factual. where are you going? I have a murder to solve. i thought that's what we were doing. Okay, look, i'm so- i- i am just kidding. I do have another source. And you call your ex-wife a "deep-fried twinkie." Oh, trust me-as annoying and intrusive you think i am, She is a million times worse. what about alexis? Maybe she misses her mom. Maybe it would be a good idea to have her back in town. yeah, right. This once, when alexis was 9, Meredith dropped by to take her out to lunch. so? In paris. paris! And then she acted like there was nothing wrong. She's auntie mame on meth. if she's so bad, Then why'd you sleep with her this morning? Let me tell you something about crazy people. The sex is unbelievable. how shallow are you? Very. you know, i don't have time for this. Someone order lunch? Detective beckett, Meet my other source. The symbol's a vever. A representation of one who can open crossroads Into the spirit world. Michelle taught me everything i know about vodun. Which obviously isn't much. That scene with the topless girl And the chicken blood- what was that? I took a few liberties. You know, from the design, I'd say this isn't haitian, jamaican or dominican. This is hard-core nigerian. What about this charm? the charm's an offering to a vodun saint, or loa. In this case, it's ogun. He's usually called upon to help find something That's been lost. so our killer's looking for something. Something the victim once possessed. maybe that's why he was tortured. Could the kind of ceremony Indicate what the killer was looking for? unfortunately, no. How do you know so much about this? Because i practice. My junior year, i spent abroad in nigeria. Fell in love with the religion, the cuisine. Michelle owns the best nigerian restaurant in the city. It's funny. i never would've pegged you for the occult type. Occult is in the eye of the beholder, detective. As bizarre as vodun may seem to you, I assure you, the beliefs of western religions Seem just as strange to outsiders. How do you like the cow's foot stew? Cow's foot? You said it was beef. Technically, cow is beef. besides, you liked it. So... This murder-is, um, is that a part of the ceremony, as well? No. vodun is a peaceful, deeply spiritual religion Practiced by millions of people Across the world every day. I doubt whoever did this is very peaceful. No. Your killer may be vodun, But that's not why this man's dead. He was killed Because he had something the killer desperately wants. And he's not gonna stop until he finds it. Excuse me. Beckett. Yeah, it's ryan. We got another one. Victim's name is darcy cho. Second-year lawyer at a firm downtown. Multiple stab wounds, just like the last one. neighbor found the door open, called the super. This is what they found. the staging is exactly the same. Yeah. when they saw what they had, West side boys gave us a call. looks like she put up a fight. Defensive wounds on her forearm. paraphernalia is the same as the other murder. And i found another charm in her mouth. Anything back from c.s.u. on the other scene? Candle's basic paraffin, found in any bodega. Figure it's gonna be the same with this one. The cloth is a common red flannel. Glass bowl-made in china. What about the blood? chicken blood. Maybe she used this purse to defend herself. We know he hasn't found what he's looking for. how do you know? The charm in her mouth. He still needs the spirits to guide him. chapter ten. Find out what you can about darcy. See if she knew our first victim. I wanna know how these murders are connected. Right. Mr. simmons, you wanted to see me? Alexis, i'm afraid we have some bad news. What? no, is it my dad? did he get shot? It's not your dad, sweetie. Mom? it's your grandfather. He passed away this morning. Grandfather? I know. it's a lot to take in. Mom, i have a calculus test today. Given the circumstances, i'm sure mr. brown Will let you make it up. Thank you, mr. simmons, for your compassion In this trying time. Let's go, honey. lots to do. Uh, mom, grandpa died six years ago. I know, but a death in the family- Always a good excuse to get out of school. No, it's a creepy excuse. Come on, i need some alexis time. Do you realize i've been in town a whole week, And we haven't even gone shopping? we're going shopping on saturday... When i don't have school. but bendel's is having its sale now! I studied all week for this test. okay, why bother learning math If you don't get to apply it in real-life situations, Like calculating your savings? Come on, what's the harm? Unless you really want to go back And tell mr. simmons your mother's a liar. Fine, but promise we're not leaving the city. Come on! It doesn't make sense. why would someone kill her? Ms. button, your office manager Said that you and darcy were close. We joined the firm at the same time. Neither of us knew anyone in the city, So we just, sort of, became best friends. Do you recognize this man? We think he and darcy might be connected. No, i don't... What happened to him? That's what we're trying to find out. Oh, god. you mean this is what happ- Who would do something like this? I spoke to jill button, darcy's b.f.f. She said she's pretty familiar With all of darcy's friends and clients, But she's never seen the vic before. The law firm does some corporate stuff, Some immigration work, but there's nothing To indicate any involvement in something like this. so our first victim gets killed In a religious ritual, and then history repeats itself With this lawyer the very same day? oh, there's a lawyer joke there somewhere, I just can't think of it. and then the killer tosses the woman's apartment Looking for what - money, drugs, what? as far as we can tell, darcy was clean. Yo, we got a hit on the first victim's prints. I.n.s. database. jamal buonsi? Nigerian national. Entered the u.s. on a student visa 18 months ago. Was enrolled at n.y.u. as an exchange student. His visa expired a year ago. yep. Looks like he decided to stay. lucky him. Any word on his last known whereabouts? yeah, i was able to track down the family That he lived with when he was a student. Last time they saw him, he was in a cab On his way to kennedy. i take it that's not the end of the story. Turns out that jamal and their 13-year-old son Were pretty close. Couple of months ago, the folks discovered That they were still in touch. jamal's cell phone number, Billed to an address on east 3rd. that's just a few blocks from where jamal's body was found. East 3rd's right near darcy cho's law firm. And you said darcy cho's firm did some work on immigration. Yeah. you and esposito take a ride down there. I want you to look at darcy cho's client list. Maybe jamal was using another name. we'll get a warrant for the billing address. Find out what this guy wants Before this son of a bitch kills again, all right? yes, sir. I wasn't expecting a doorman building, But a 6-story walk-up? You should've seen my first apartment. Three flights up on an air shaft Over a restaurant. The whole place smelled like chicken wings. They come here looking for a new start, And this is what they get... Slum housing? Still, for some, it's better than what they left. Sounds like jamal didn't live alone. Yes? Detective beckett, nypd. No! Hands! show me your hands! Immigration. I'm not immigration. everybody, just relax, okay? If you're not from immigration... Then who are you? i'm a homicide detective. I'm looking for information on jamal buonsi. We don't know any jamal. Then you wanna tell me why his cell phone Is billed to this address? Detective. Same red flannel. What is it? Whose bed is that? We can link the red flannel to two other murders. In this country, that puts you in a lot of trouble. I've done nothing wrong. two people are dead. One of them is a man that you lived with. Same red flannel, same candles. and again, here. Why did you kill her, azi? I don't know this woman. i haven't killed anyone. So you're telling me that it's all just a coincidence That these things were found in your apartment under your bed? They weren't mine! They were for someone else. Who? do you want to go back to nigeria? Because i can arrange that with a single phone call. So can he. Who? Jamal was your friend, wasn't he? Yes. Then don't you want us to catch who killed him? Don't you want justice? His name is charles. Charles oni. charles oni. Immigrants know this man. He owns the places where we live. He owns the places where we work. And what about jamal? did he work for him, too? At his store on canal street. But it- It-it-it was only temporary. He was going to save his money to- To apply for a visa, become legal. And oni had a problem with that? No. Yesterday, when oni came looking for jamal, He said jamal had taken something. But jamal was not a thief. But oni insisted. He say- he knew my father Was the priest of our village. So he made me to show him how to invoke the spirits. What did jamal take? Oni didn't say. Why didn't you ask? 'cause i was scared. Because he would've killed me. The only reason i am telling you this now Is because jamal was a friend. He did not deserve to die like that. Oni was wrong. City records show no vendor's license For a charles oni on canal street. Well, the guy's exploiting illegals. I doubt he's gonna use his real name. Clearly not. the apartment is owned by a robert burnett. No listing in the tri-state area, And the address is a p.o. box in jersey. Yo, yo, law firm's a dead end. They've never heard of anyone named jamal buonsi, And there was nothing suspicious in darcy's client list. That's perfect, 'cause our suspect's never heard of darcy cho. We still have no idea what our two victims have in common. Excuse me, ma'am. no, i'm not gonna wait downstairs. Do you have any idea who pays your salary? me and my taxes. Is that- uh, yep. Richard! over here! Deep-fried twinkie? afraid so. Meredith! what a surprise. I know. isn't it great? In l.a., no one ever just stops by. Don't you just love this town? more and more by the minute. Uh, meredith, these are detectives ryan, esposito And detective beckett. Oh, beckett- your new muse. Alexis told me all about it, And i simply had to stop by. You know, i was his inspiration once. Were you now? Still am, from time to time. right, kitten? Kitten? I had this dream once, Only i was naked and far less embarrassed. Anyway, we were in the neighborhood And i have a dinner tonight, so i thought i would Drop alexis here instead of schlepping all the way downtown. Is that s.j.p.'s purse? s.j.p.? Sarah jessica parker. She wore one just like it to the armani show in milan. It was on "fashion scoop daily" last week. Well, actually, this purse belongs to one of our victims. oh, that is so tragic. More tragic, of course, if it'd been the real thing. But... still. what, are you saying this was fake? Well, look at the leather and the stitching. It's totally a knockoff. i mean, it's good enough To fool the untrained shopper, but i have a retail eye. canal street. Canal's where they sell the knockoffs-watches, luggage. and handbags. Darcy's office is right near canal. If she was gonna buy a designer knockoff... she might've got it from the stall where jamal works. Oni's stall. that's what connects our two victims. Get a sketch from azi. Maybe one of the other vendors Will be able to i.d. oni's stall. you got it, boss. See? i always was your lucky charm. Just think of the things we'll do once i move back. That's oni. That's oni Charles oni. Now we have a face to go with the name. Someone on canal street's gotta know this guy. Where's castle? He went home. Deep-fried twinkie, huh? I didn't ask. Why don't you get a corkboard Like a normal person? Why don't you knock like a normal person? you know meredith Kidnapped alexis from school today? and we all paid a hefty ransom. It's outrageous. you remember your touring production Of "a chorus line"? I almost had to repeat fifth grade. oh, that was different. i was working and trying to be a mother. I wasn't just waltzing into town like a diva, Disrupting everybody's life. that's who she is. you know that. Have you considered what it's going to be like Having meredith back in new york, How it's going to affect you? you mean how it's going to affect you. All of us, actually. Well, what do you want me to do, mother? It's not like i could ban her from new york. And this whole theater thing- it's ridiculous. You know she hasn't landed a role in months? That's right. i made a couple of calls. Why do you think she's moving back to new york? She can't get arrested in l.a. I wonder if she could get arrested in new york. I know people now. and does she honestly think That she's just gonna show up with a reel of, what, "according to jim" guest spots, And push some real actor aside, Some actor who has... Who has dedicated their entire life To the greatest profession in the world? You don't choose the theater. The theater chooses you. Why did you marry her, anyway? I don't know, mother. maybe she reminded me of you. Look at this crap. All my years on the force, i never understood Why we never shut these guys down. come here. See, this is supposed to be a gucci. But if you look close, Instead of the "g.g.," the initials say "c.c." i don't know. that's pretty close, bro. But not exact. and that's what keeps these guys From getting busted. see, technically, It's not an imitation. it's an homage. an "homage." right. You ladies picking out something pretty for yourselves? You got the warrant? which one is it? This place has been trashed. You guys, same chanel bags. That's weird-shredded, like our victim's purse. Maybe darcy wasn't using it to defend herself. Beckett. This one looks different. It doesn't look like the ones that we found In the other victims' mouths. I've seen this symbol before. That's the symbol for death. Why would a guy mark his own stall With the death symbol? He wouldn't. the symbol was meant for him. Charles oni's been marked for death. The linings have all been cut out. All of this stuff is imported, right? Yeah. you know, knockoffs would be the perfect delivery system For a smuggler. yeah, but what are they smuggling? The only person who can tell us that Has been marked for death. well, if he is still alive, He doesn't have any incentive to stick around. Castle? Where's he going? Notify passport control. get 'em the sketch of oni And tell 'em to put his name and aliases on the no-fly list. You got it, boss. Castle? Castle! i'm on tv. are you having a breakdown? not a breakdown. a breakthrough. And i really am ruggedly handsome, aren't i? i'm waiting for the breakthrough. Look behind me. if that camera's recording... Then we'd be able to see who trashed the stall. What can i say? People like to see themselves on television. I mean, you would not believe the things people do In front of a camera. i'm listening. Like, this one chick, she's standing there Right in front of the store, and she starts to take off Her, uh- just show us the recordings From the past couple of days, okay? Her blood sugar gets low, she gets a little cranky. zip it... kitten. I'm sorry, but i can't show you the recording. You need a warrant? wouldn't help. sold it. Sold the camera in the window? some guy rolls in here yesterday, Asked for that one specifically. I told him we got others, ones with boxes. But he wants the one in the window. what does he look like? 6', big, black, had an accent. Was it him? No, he owns the stall across the street. you know him? We say hi. but this guy- he seemed, uh, heavy. Not in the physical sense-just something about him, you know? Like he'd seen things - bad things. what else? He paid cash-retail. I mean, at my prices? he didn't even try to negotiate once. Would you be willing to work with a police sketch artist? Wouldn't a real picture be better? You said that he took the camera and the recordings. Lady, this is an electronics store. I got cameras all over this place. Yeah, he does look like the kind of guy Who'd paint a death symbol on your floor. what i don't get is, why would he want the camera? 'cause he had the same idea we did. we wanted the camera because we wanted to find him. Well, what was he looking for? and what was inside the purses? Esposito. yeah. really? When? no, no, no. absolutely. Bring him in. T.s.a. just pulled charles oni Out of the security line at j.f.k. off our sketch. Good call, bro. thank you. Where was he going? Nigeria. under the name robert burnett. I don't know what you're talking about. I was going home to visit my family. Then why'd you only have a one-way ticket? My mother is ill. I did not know when i'd be returning. Must be nice, being able to see your mother, Something that jamal buonsi will never get a chance to do. We know that you are involved in both of these murders. Azi-the man that you intimidated into finding jamal- He is very eager to testify against you. Apparently, he takes his religious beliefs Very seriously. Doesn't believe vodun should be used to kill people. i didn't kill anyone. Then why were you looking for jamal? Tell me something- what's in the purse? What are you smuggling, mr. oni? I want a lawyer. Are you sure? because if you get a lawyer, You'll be out of here in about an hour, And i won't let you leave town, And that's exactly what you want, isn't it, to leave town? You scare a lot of people, mr. oni- Immigrants, illegals. Tell me... Who scares you? I don't know this man. He knows you. Matter of fact, he's marked you for death. Jamal worked for you, and he's dead. Darcy cho-she just bought a purse from you, And now she's dead. Why? I won't talk without protection. I can't protect you unless you tell me from what. His name is mukhtar baylor. Very bad, very dangerous. Former child soldier. They call him "the butcher of benin." What's he doing in the u.s.? He traffics-drugs, women, whatever will make him money. It is him that killed jamal and the woman. Why? If i tell you, You will protect me? Oni's a counterfeiter. He gets papers for illegals- passports, visas, Whatever they need. a real friend to the community. Oni also provided baylor with documents For his traffickers. sewn inside the lining of his purses. Yeah, which he keeps in the back of the stall. only he didn't count on "fashion scoop daily." The web site. yeah, the article on sarah jessica parker? Appears there was a run on the purses. yeah. our first vic, jamal- Yeah? he sold bags out front. He didn't know about oni's scam. When he ran out of bags, he sold the ones from the back. Why didn't he just get oni to forge more documents? It takes time, and baylor doesn't have time. the papers are for baylor's brother in africa. The nigerian officials are closing in on him For drug trafficking. If baylor doesn't get him to the u.s. soon, They'll execute him. oni says baylor operates out of a warehouse downtown. Find this dirtball before he murders someone else, all right? Where did the bag come from? Oh, sorry, that's mine. I felt, given everything that's happened, I should be prepared. I got this special order. And look. "writer"? cool, huh? You don't need a vest. if you shoot me, do i not bleed? You're not gonna get shot. and you know why? Because you are going nowhere near the gunfire. You're staying here. yes, we've seen how well that works. Stay here, castle, and don't do anything. All right, this is our guy. got him? yeah. Let's go. dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! dad! I'm gonna- i'm gonna just get that. Hi. Alexis? what's wrong? richard, guess what. Meredith? i found a place. a perfect place. it's light, spacious And only a million six. But the text said "alexis." it said it was an emergency. Well, how else was i gonna get you to call me back? B- but- are you at the loft? Mm, i was in the neighborhood and i had to pee, So i had eduardo let me in. so i called the realtor, And here's the thing-i may need you to cosign the loan. Meredith, we're divorced. I- i'm not gonna cosign a loan for you. It's for alexis, too. i mean, it's only a one-bedroom, But you want her to be comfortable when she visits, right? Look, can i call you back? i'm right in the middle Of capturing a very dangerous nigerian drug lord... It's kind of a thing. Okay, later then. hey, richard? Yeah. Thanks. For what? putting up with me. I know i've been a handful, but... Once things settle down, i think it's gonna be great. That's the guy. that's the guy! Hey! hey! Hey! the- Hey! the- Are you even listening to me? Hey! This is gonna bite me in the ass. Castle! What do you mean you didn't get the plate? Uh, there was a- it was coming- what kind of car was it? Uh, it was big. it was an s.u.v., i think. you think? What about the color? um, black. uh, dark blue. Uh, it's-it's very hard being a witness. I don't know how you guys ever get a conviction. I'm usually really good with the detailed stuff. I just-i got distracted. yeah, you were rolling calls during a tac strike. Interesting. he was supposed to be inside the building! What about the color of your shirt? What is that right now? is that black or blue? I- i-i couldn't quite tell. the sun was in my eyes. Weird. Really weird. It's the same red flannel. Hey... vodun guy's a yoga nut. Well, just 'cause you're a cold-blooded killer Doesn't mean you don't take care of yourself. You guys. The camera from the electronics store. See? not a complete bust. There's jamal. And darcy cho. Go back, go back, go back, go back. okay. More. more. all right. Stop. well, looks like someone else besides darcy Bought a chanel bag from jamal. and she's carrying a yoga mat. That's why he bought the camera. Baylor's looking for her. he wants his passport So he's hunting down everyone that bought that purse. eight million people in the city. He'll never find her. he found darcy cho. he'll find her. Not if we find her first. You zoom in on her hand. She's got a coffee from java loft. So? so we're looking for a yoga studio Near a java loft somewhere off canal street. Gotta be a dozen possibilities. baylor's got a head start. Yes, but i've got an awesome service plan now. We're looking for yoga girl. You guys see if anyone else bought that purse. There are four java lofts within five blocks Of canal street. and yoga studios? The time stamp on the video was 3:22. We're looking for a yoga studio nearby With a class that ends at about 3:00. maybe the woman was on her way to yoga class. You ever try doing a half moon pose Cranked up on caffeine? It completely throws off your chi. Trust me, she bought her coffee after class. a class finishing around 3:00 p.m. Would give her enough time to buy a coffee. But enough time to finish it before canal street. Got it. Nypd. Do you know this girl? Diana edwards. what's she done? what do you mean? You're the second cop that's come in looking for her. another cop was here? Yeah, he just left a few minutes ago. baylor. we need diana's address right now. Diana edwards! nypd! open up!
