 - Does he know how you feel about him? - No! Why not? Because I don't even know how I feel about him. Yes! Very nice! Hello. How many bones did they have to break to get her in there? We won't know until I'll get her back to the lab. - Don't contaminate my crime scene. - Sorry, it must be the feathers. Beckett's here . No sign of forced entry, it's seems as the others. It's like a home invasion crew "on for for pit" "Seting" up the game becoming more violent. - ¡Bless you! - ¡Bless you! Jinx! ¿What's wrong with him?

 Goose stunt. He's alergic. I'm sorry, under the time on the rules of Jinx. you're not allowed to speek untill I release you. -Bless you. -Bless you. Reverse double Jinx. - I just... - Castle, mouth shut, until I release you. Thank you, Ryan. So what do we have? It's Joanne Delgado, daugher of Susan Delgado, the victim. She called the second nights for mom. Only this night mom doesn't pick up. She calls doorman. Doorman comes up, - Finds the door ajar and... - ¿And? Well, let's just say it was definitely Becket's flagrant. Blood spots indicates single GSW(Gunshot wound). Close range. ¿?...smell the cordite. I'll take your word for. Ow! They shot her and stuffed in the safe. Better than the last one. They beat to get it death. Non of the neighbors heart a gunshot? Nada. Must be heavy sleepers. No, they used a pillow as a "Portman" sound suppresor. - Ahem! - Ye.. Yes, I broke the Jinx, I'll buy you a soda. - Any shell casings? - Non. Probably used a revolver. And a bolt cutter. Her wedding ring. She won't give it up and so he punished for it. - Husband? - Death a few years ago. In a building like this? This part of town, you think should be safe. Nop, pun intended. How often people kill neightbors like this? Same as anywhere else, Castle. Just the once. Each of the robberies took place in a different part of the city. In different high-end part of the city. Wall safes and high jewelry. This guys came in knowing exactly what they gonna find. Well, it must be a pattern, something that connects them all. The first was almost three month ago? Central Park West Bob y Linda Kesler. Were bound, gagged and beaten. Intruders wore masks. Took properly $175.000 in jewelry. Same MO (Modus Operandi) on York Street? Yeah, only when Mr Bruner refused to open the safe, They broke his wife's arms. Which brings us the last night. They getting bolder. They escalating their violence. Well, it can't be random. How do they know what's in the safes? "Safes"... Is that a word? Is a "safes"? It can't be right. - And you write for living? - Castle, the point. The point is our home invaders seems to know enough a lot about their victims. We compared insurance companies, Home security vendors, even the kind of safes... ...that they had. Nothing's been a match. I'm just thinking... they seem to know their targets so well, maybe they, actually, know them. Maybe the victim's daughter can tell us. Yeah, we were close. She was my mother. So, you know most of her friends. Her friends? Yeah, but... Were there either you got strong feelings about? and... Like maybe, someone she met recently? No. Did any of her friends had money problems? Monsters broke into her place and kill her. Why are you asking about her friends? - Do you know Nelson and Janet Bruner? - No. How about Richard and Julie Pastori? - Or a Bob y Linda Kesler? - Who are these people? They're victims of three previous home invasion robberies. Robberies that we think were committed by the same people that murdered yout mother. What, there were others? I mean... - How long this is been going on? - Few months. Months? What? ¿And you haven't got them yet? They didn't murder anyone untill last week. That's when I got this case, and since then, we have been doing everything we can... No, don't press conference to me, Detective. I work in public relations, so you can safe your speech because I have heart them all. I'm the one who drafts all of that ??(manipulated speech) after airline crashes and E. Coli (Escherichia Coli) poisonings. "Our hearts go out to the victims families". ¿Our hearts? ¿What does it mean? She said that she felt like baking. She wants me to come over, but I was busy. I was busy. And now she is dead. Joanne... Listen to me. You're gonna want to play out every possible escenario in the next couple of days... If only you've been there, if only you come by, if you didn't work so late And I'm telling you... It's not your fault. The ones to blame are the monsters that murder your mom. This isn't a speech. It's not a platitude. It's a promise. I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that they pay for what they did. It's very impressive, the way you handle her back there. I didn't handle her, Castle. I just told her the truth. Same thing I'm gonna tell the other home invasion victims. Jinx paid in full. It's the job, Castle. You're a sure selling, Beckett. Ryan y Esposito could not manage that level of empathy. That's not true. They just safe it for fantasy football trades. Makes me think about Alexis. What would she do if something happens to me? Well... is she still has your mom, right? Meredith is more like a crazy aunt with a credit card. Of the two of us, I'm the more responsible. Pretty sad, isn't it? Well, wouldn't worry about it too much, Castle. After all, only the good die young. Listen, Freud... I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to talk about my mom, see if you can squezee any more pulp for your fiction. Pulp? You think what I do is pulp? Listen, I would have you know that the New York Review of Books Not the New York Times book Review Magazine , "el crítico del New York Times", the New York Review of Books said that Derrick Storm is this generation answer to... I've read that piece, and... even you have to admit That is more than a little hyperbolic. So... how much do you pay the reviewer? A case of Châteauneuf-Du-Pape but that's not the point. The point is... you read the New York Review of Books? Oh, so many layers to the Beckett onion. However do you peel them all. Esposito, anything from the other victims? Beckett's Downtown finishing the canvas. But What we do know is Kesler's and the Pastori's didn't know each other and neither one of the Bruner's or Susan Delgado. Well, so much of personal angle. Four luxury Buildings, four major scores and we got nothing. I am these guys, I got no incentive to quit now either. Yeah, well... who ever they are it definitely have some right straight skills About that... Forensic just came back from Delgados's place. They found brass shavings in the lock mechanism on the front door. Brass shavings? They used a bump key. Bad guys filed down a standard house key, and then they used ¿?¿? to driving the lock. Separates the ¿? "cylinder" like billiard balls. I know what a bump key is. - No, you don't. - ¿¿?? were in Delgado's door it's a high-end import. No way standard bump key would work. No, they have to use something special. Something the habituals couldn't rig. - What you thinking? - Well... I busted this guy while back, specialized in bump keys, and not afraid to get a little blood in his hands either Bump keys and violence, I like them already. "Evan Mitchell". - Evan Mitchell? - Yes, You know him? He's a legacy . His dad and his grand are a legends in the industry. Yeah, I caught him armed in a jewelery on 47th. - ??? - When did he get out? two weeks before our first ??. Pick him up. Say hello to his little friend. It was in his waist belt when we snatch him up. The serial numbers are scratched up. Heavy on ?? and light on convictions. Amazing how many times the guy can be arrested without ever serving time. He's got a pretty good lawyer. Or good at what he does. Good enough to be our perp? Why you writers always call 'em "perps"? It's not how you call'em? - We've got a hole of names for them. - Yeah. Pippers, pisshead, ogre, creep... - Crook, tarado, zopenco... - Rufián, pedazo de mierda. - Destro, scam... - ??? Slik'o slick... - Mope. - "Sli stack" ??. - Slow down, slow down. - Suspect. We call them suspects. I'm sold School.Soy de la vieja escuela. I like dirt bag. Classic. Tell me about the gun, Mr. Mitchell. Well... I'm not talking without a lawyer. Why? You're guilty or something? Yeah, I'm not runing faster enough when your boys showed. Where were you last night between five and nine? I didn't do it. You didn't do what? It doesn't matter what. What everything I was, I wasn't. So, where were you then? Happy hour. Little neighborhood place drinking belfast carbombs With some of my westie pals. You got anyone that can verify that for me? Yeah. I got about 30 people or so can. Conservative estimate. How come I got this crazy hunch That most of those people got records a lot like yours? Well, I wasn't drinking tea at the plaza. Look, you want more reliable witnesses, Give me an hour or so, I'll see what I can do. Must be pretty well connected. Friends in high places. Who's mary with the manicure? I know he's not a cop, not with that haircut. I'm assisting detective beckett in the investigation. Assisting? What's the matter, sweetie? You can't hack it out there alone? You wanna play? Let's play. I got an ex-Con with a gun And two fresh homicides just looking for a home. You can fish all you want, detective. Smart fish don't bite. We could hold him on the gun, But there's no match with ballistics on mrs. Delgado. And without other evidence to link him to the other homicide- I'll find something, sir. Not if his alibi checks out. Sir, it's just pots and kettles. On the last robbery, not the first. Mitchell was being arraigned on an unrelated burglary The same day this crew struck. Unless you can break his alibi on this one, he's a dead end. You gotta watch those silhouettes. They can be shifty little bastards. Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate. Man, when I hit a wall, all I got's one of those stress balls And internet porn. Castle- Look, I get it, all right? You made a promise To a daughter to find her mother's killer. It doesn't take freud to see what's what. But you're gonna run up some blind alleys Before you get out of the maze. Look, as much as I appreciate your folksy dr. Phil aphorisms, I just wanna- Wouldn't it be more of a challenge If they weren't standing still? Okay, Castle. You show me how it's done. All yours. It's not a duel, scaramouche. Here. Square off to the target. Feet shoulder-Distance apart. Okay. Gauntlet your right fist in your left palm. Shot too soon. Yeah, well... You know, we could always just cuddle, Castle. Oh, funny. And a smile. Good. That's better. You know, I, uh, came down to ask you if I could, uh, Take home some of those stolen property photos. Photos of the jewelry? Why? I don't know. I just thought it might spark something. That kinda hurt. Tell you what. You put any of the next three in the ten ring, And I will give you the files. Yeah? Yeah. You're a very good teacher. Hey, dad. Hey, how was your date with owen? Dad, it wasn't a date. It was a study group. Okay, how many in the group? Just the two of us. Pilfering evidence again, I see. Borrowing. And these are just copies. Mm-Hmm. Insurance companies like to maintain photos Of pieces like these for identification In case anything gets lost or stolen. Hello, gorgeous! Ooh! Where have you been all my life? You know, I'm thinking of installing A new security system, maybe even a panic room. Panic room? What for, panic attacks? If anyone comes, We'll beat them off with swords. Or pens, since they're mightier. No, I'm serious. I just want us to be safe. Oh, life isn't safe, especially not in new york- Cranes collapse, Air conditioners fall out of the sky. In the end, there's just a few short years. The most you can do is make the most of it Before something knocks you down. "People living deeply have no fear of death." Anais nin? Mother, how many of those have you had? Oh, shh. These are pretty incredible pieces. You wouldn't use a normal fence for these. You'd need someone with impeccable taste, Someone who appreciated their value, Someone who had high-End buyer connections. Powell. Oh, now there was a man. And you had to ruin it. Who's powell? That was years ago. I'm sure he's forgotten all about that. Who's powell? Forgotten? You forced him into retirement. You ruined his life. He threatened to slit your throat. Dad, who's powell? You remember that character of mine- Um, bentley silver? The jewel thief in "storm rising"? Yeah, I kinda based him on powell. Kind of? You stole the man's entire life. And then your father, genius that he is, Thanked him in the acknowledgments, Completely blowing his cover. Yeah, he can't still be mad. I'm gonna go see him. Dad! No, I'll be okay. Don't worry. I think it'll be fine. If he doesn't slit your throat, Tell him he owes me an evening at le cirque. Dad! Dad! I have been waiting a long time for this, Castle. What can I say, rick? You really had it coming. Yes, I did. Thanks for not killing me. The carpet's an antique... Turkish, mid-1600s. A blood stain on it would've been a disaster. Besides, I was ready to retire. Being a ghost is a young man's game. Good to see you again, old friend. And you, as well, dear boy. Tell me, how is martha? Still a one-Woman show in search of an audience. She says you owe her an evening at le cirque. And to what do I owe the pleasure? You're not planning a sequel, I hope. What's this? Stolen jewelry From that rash of home invasions. So very lovely. I was wondering if anyone's tried to fence them. I've heard nary a whisper of anything in this range. The police are holding a guy named mitchell. Haven't had the pleasure. Anything special about these? Anything they have in common? These are hardly everyday wear. I suppose one dusts them off for that very special occasion. So then how did our thieves know they were there? Seeing comes before wanting, rick. These chaps... May actually live among their victims And move through their world. Anything else special about them? Without seeing the scene of the crime, Anything more would be mere speculation. Well, the crime scene's all locked and sealed. I don't think I could get you in there. Let that be the least of our concerns. You, uh, don't seem out of practice. Just like riding a bike. Our thieves used a bump key. This new generation... how utterly vulgar. Rick... You didn't tell me they put her in the safe. What's the significance? The significance... Is it's unnecessary. It's brutality for brutality's sake. This used to be a gentlemen's game. We were like ghosts. We could walk through walls and simply disappear. But whoever did this... They're more like vampires. Just the blood makes them feel alive. These aren't the sort of chaps a fellow in my line of work Would care to meet by chance in the dark. How often does that happen? More often than you'd think, actually. Ours is a very small community. And then what? In my day, we'd usually come to some sort of an agreement. You see, there was a code of conduct among professionals. Powell. Castle? Hey. What's going on? You brought a thief to a crime scene. It was very helpful. It was criminal trespassing. To-May-Toh, to-Mah-Toh. Tell your friend to keep up his disappearing act. And the next time you show up at a crime scene without me, I'll show you how my taser works. Promise? Ah. So why were you there? Seeing if there's anything I missed. So? So? Was there? Did mitchell make bail yet? Paperwork's not done yet. I'm holding him out of spite. I want to talk to him. Why? We already know he wasn't involved. Something powell said. I think mitchell knows more than he's saying. And what makes you think he'll share it with us? Not us. Just me. So what are you, A forensic psychiatrist, some kind of profiler? Actually, uh, I'm a writer. An embedded reporter, huh? What, are you gonna make me famous? Not that kind of writer. I'm a novelist. Yeah? Uh, anything that, uh, I might've heard of? Uh... "storm's last stand." "Storm season." Derrick storm? Yeah. I love that guy. Why the hell did you kill him? It's a long story, but I'm working on a new one. And I gotta tell you, it is very cool. But I want to get the details right. They never get the details right, Not in books, movies. They always write us as clowns and thugs. They never stop to think that maybe we got mortgages, Families... exactly. They never stop to think that maybe we got mortgages, Families... exactly. Okay, so... in the new book, It's about this crew of home invaders, Based on the crew we're looking for right now. I got this one scene where a guy just like you Runs into these guys by accident In the middle of a job. Wouldn't happen to me. I'm not doing residentials. Not at least until you catch these guys. These guys are dark. What, you know 'em? Their shot caller came into the bar a few months back, Looking to put together a crew. Wanted to bring me on, said he had eyes inside Working up scores for him, Feeding him the glengarry leads- Items, names, addresses. Said that all he needed was one of my bump keys. Did you give it to him? Yeah, I gave it to him, but just to get rid of him. I wasn't about to join his crew. I'll be damned. Why not? Like I said, these guys were dark. And I'm a 2-Minute man, in and out. That's my one hard-And-Fast. But this sadistic whack job? Whoa. He said he liked to play with his food before he ate it. All right, this, um, this shot caller... If I put him in the book, I want it to feel authentic. How would you describe him? This is the man who killed her? We think so. We believe he may have had more than just A passing relationship with your mom. And he could be anyone- A waiter, dog walker, Doorman, personal trainer... no, I don't recognize him. Maybe one of the other victims knows? Your mom wear jewelry often? No, just to special events. What kind of special events? Uh, a fashion show last year... Gallery openings, fund-Raisers... My mother loved her causes. You know, opera companies, Environmental groups... Eyes inside. Why are we doing this again? Well, according to mitchell, The shot caller who wanted the bump key Had someone feeding him inside information About our victims. And powell says the pieces of jewelry being stolen Are the kind you save for special occasions. Special occasion, like a charity event. So we find an organization That all of our victims supported. And we find our guy. Delgado and pastori both gave to the manhattan opera society. But not the last two victims. I got three families that donated to a.I.D.S. America- Delgado, bruner and kesler. But not pastori. Maybe pastori was a guest of one of the other three victims. No, none of the families knew each other. Wait a second. M.A.D.T.- That's the metropolitan american dance theater. Metropolitan american dance theater. Metro american dance... m.A.D.T. That's the non-Profit our invaders are profiting from. Find out who was in charge and how I can find them. Right on. There she is-Anne greene, the company's director. She can invade my home anytime. Yeah, well, if she's in on it, She's doing it purely for kicks. Textile heiress, no record and clean dmv. White centerpieces go on the angel tables. Red centerpieces go on sponsor tables. Ms. Greene, I'm detective beckett, And this is- Ricky? Ricky Castle? I've heard perfectly awful things about you From my friend cheney. Cheney? Tall, brunette, aftermarket nose. Cheney... of course. How is cheney? Oh, I hear she's a great scandal in st. Moritz. Oh. And you? Currently between scandals, actually. Oh, you two aren't... Not yet. No. Never. In fact, um, ricky here is assisting me With a homicide investigation. How exciting. Yes, and it involves your organization. All of our employees go through an extensive background check. I can assure you none of them are involved. I'm still gonna need a list of the employees Who had access to donor records. Of course. Detective, I'm sure this is all a coincidence. Unfortunately, I'm not, and that's why I'm gonna need a copy of your donor list. That may be a problem. The people who give publicly- They're not an issue. But some of our donors cherish their anonymity. We're contractually obligated to protect that. What about their lives? Do your donors cherish those, as well? I assure you, my office will contact each of them And alert them to the situation. I'd really like to contact them myself. I'm sorry, detective, but my hands are tied. If you want my confidential donor list, You're gonna need a court order. Awkward. We ran employees and volunteers. None have priors or records. Hello? Shh, shh! What's she doing? Writing an affidavit for a court order. That no one is going to sign. Did you see that list of board members? Half the judges in town are on it. What am I supposed to do, just let someone else die? Whoa, hey. You seem a little stressed. Hey, you know what you need? A night out on the town. A what now? What are those? The gateway to another world. Castle. They hold four fund-Raisers a year. The last one took place a week before the robberies began. No. It is perfect. You don't have to ask who the donors are, Because they'll all be there, wearing their jewelry. If the employees and volunteers are clean, then our perp... skell. Could be working the party. And we can work the door. So it's settled. Pick me up at 8:00? Oh, it's, uh, a black-Tie event. That's not a problem, is it? Uh, no. No. No, no, unh-Unh. That one goes to the thrift store. Whoa! "Karma chameleon." The girl at saks said fluorescent is in. Well, then she was on commission. Too "showgirls"? You know what he's trying to do? He wants to humiliate me. Lanie, can you get that, please? All right, but you better not be wearing your prom dress When I get back. My dad, nervous for a date? It's not a date. It's an undercover operation. Uh-Huh. Would you? Yeah. I don't know why you won't tell me where the party is. Because you'll show up. Who was it? Delivery. From who? Let's find out. "Bippity boppity boo"? "Cinderella." It's from him. Oh, please, it's a dress. Now open it up, girlfriend. Oh, I knew he was arrogant, But this- This is complete- Oh. Stunning. Simply stunning. Come in, come in. Oh, hang on. Hang on... You look incredible. Really? Really. You clean up nice, detective beckett. Thank you, Castle. I was nominated For a, uh, tony once... Oh, no, martha, I couldn't. Yes, you can. Let me- Oh, it's brilliant. So where are you guys headed tonight? Uh, uh, uh, we're going to the, uh, waldorf. Man, these guys are guilty of tax evasion, Not home invasion. Yeah, well... Appearances can be deceiving. Nice dress. Yeah, what there is of it. I'd let you borrow it, esposito, But you stretched out the last one. Big cheese! Ricky! Ricky! Hey, hey, hey! Why didn't you tell me you were gonna be at this shindig? I would've given you a ride. Oh, last-Minute thing. Listen, mr. Mayor, I'd like to present to you detective Kate beckett. Kate beckett, you know the mayor. So this is detective beckett. It's an honor to meet you, sir. Oh, please, call me bob. Rick, she's even prettier than you said. Excuse me a minute. Of course. You talk about me to "bob"? Well, we play cards together. Well, that, and you are the subject of my next book. Huh. Can I get you a drink? Yeah. Vodka. Lots of vodka. But... I'm on duty, so... water? Yeah. Vodka. Could I get two very stiff vodka martinis? Don't shake 'em. Just swirl 'em around a bit. Richard. Hi... Rachel maddox. We spoke on the phone. Oh, and thank you very much for getting me the tickets. Thanks for the signed first edition for the auction. I had my eye on it, but it's probably too rich for my blood. My boyfriend paul reynolds. He's a huge fan. Oh, always nice to meet a fan. Hi. Don't sweat it. That's just rachel, anne's head of development. She's only after his money, so to speak. Oh, I'm ruthie. Um, beck- I'm s-I'm Kate. Nice to meet you. Do you work for the charity? No. No, but I am on the circuit. You know, breast cancer, land mines. Oh, you know what the best one is? Um, uh, project... what do you call it?

Listen, we're having A little gathering next month for our top donors. We're going to unveil plans for a new rehearsal space. If you're free, we'd love for you and alexis to come. You know my daughter? We make a point to know as much as we can About our potential donors so we can match their interests With our programs. So many places just ask you to write a check. We want you to know that your money is making a difference. Would you excuse me just for a second? Sure. So creepy. Negative on anyone matching our sketch. How are we doing on vendors and staff? No red flags yet. Hey, so what's it like in there? Is it buffet or passed hors d'oeuvres? Both. Hey, have you seen, uh- Castle, what are you doing? Sorry, this is the only place I knew we could talk and not be overheard. Sure it is. I was just talking To the head of, uh, donor development over there... She seems to know an awful lot about me. She's not the only one. Did you know that they call you "the white whale"? The white whale? Mm-Hmm. Not moby- No. She's in donor development. It's her job to know about you. Besides, she doesn't strike me As a criminal mastermind. Still, I think we should take a second look. Two, three... dip. Castle, a little help. It's powell. The jewel thief? I don't believe this. The two of you are in on it? Don't look at me. It was his idea. You really had me going, didn't you? The wine, the cheese, the code of conduct- And here you are, making me look the fool. I just wanted to have a bit of fun. Fun? You call what you're doing "fun"? Castle, what's going on? They're in on it together. They've all but admitted it. I am so sorry. I had no idea it was such a big deal. Big de- Two people are dead. Dead? What's he talking about? Good lord, rick. You didn't think- Then... what were you two whispering about?

He's just a foot soldier. We're looking for his general. What happened to the dress? You didn't think I was gonna interrogate him in it, did you? We were kinda hoping... Outta my chair, Castle. Yes. So you know him? We met in green haven prison. A guy like me- You know they've would've eaten me alive in there. But he looked out for me in the yard. They-They were all afraid of him, even the guards. And when he got out, he found me. I don't know how. So it was his idea to infiltrate the charity. I was already seeing rachel at the time. I mean, I was trying to go straight, But he said that I owed him. And so you just fed him all the top donors. Everything he needed was already in the dossiers- Names, addresses. I took photographs of all their jewelry, Put it all on a flash drive, but he wanted more and more. Detective, after he beat that guy to death, I told him I wanted out. But he said that if I quit, That he'd do everything he saved me from in prison. He'd do it to me and rachel. Then tell me where I can find him. Castle, as a friend, I am asking you not to leave this car, 'Cause your little hardy boy act... is gonna get me killed, I know. More like get one of them killed, And I can't have that on my conscience. Understood? What if I have to pee? Go, go, go. Nypd! We have a warrant! Look, his coffee. Still warm. Must've just missed him. And roger. Can I have your, uh, next position after 1-7-0-8? This is detective Castle to all units. That's a negatory on the backup. This dirtbag's all mine. Looks like we got the right place. Police! Police! Stop, police! Follow him out back! God. Out of the car! I- She told me I actually have to stay in here- Out of the car now! Okay, okay, okay, here I come. I'm coming. God. Go ahead... I need the practice. We got him. Get up. I tried to stay in the car. I really did. He hit me in the face, you know. Yeah, I saw that. That, uh, "go ahead, I need the practice"- That was classic. Castle! Sorry. The other pieces are still in evidence, But I don't see the harm in returning this. How do you get over it? You don't. But one day you'll wake up and you'll find That you don't mind carrying it around with you. At least that's as far as I've come. Thank you, detective. My name's Kate. If you ever need to talk... Darling, we have a visitor. Oh, pretty butch, Castle. I know, right? Come, grab a chair. Oh, no, I just came to return your mom's jewelry. You saved my life. The least I can do is make you some eggs. No, really, I - I have to get going. Nonsense! You sit down right here, Tell us all about last night. We've only heard his version. All right, um... Shall I begin at the red carpet? Yes, please. So we came out...
