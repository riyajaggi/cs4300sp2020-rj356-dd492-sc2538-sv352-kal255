 One Man's Treasure
 There are two kinds of folks
 who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:
 psychopaths and mystery writers.
 I'm the kind that pays better.
 Who am I?
 I'm Rick Castle.
 Castle.
 Castle.
 I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?
 Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.
 Detective Kate Beckett.
 Beckett.
Beckett.
 - Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.
 And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,
 I get to be on her case.
 I would be happy
to let you spank me.
 And together, we catch killers
 We make a pretty
good team, you know?
 Like Starsky and Hutch.
 Turner and Hooch.
 You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

 Oh! Oh! Oh.
 Aah!
 Check your six, Maverick.
 This is your captain
up and on the mountain.
 Listen up,
ladies and gentlemen.
 Our fugitive has been on the run
for 90 minutes.
 We're in the pipes. Let's keep
our feet dry this time.
 Jungle radio,
this is One Delta Bravo.
 Eyes on suspect.
Requesting backup, over.
 Requesting permission to deploy
 laser-activated
radioactive immobilizer.
 Permission denied.
 Really. Richard.
 I have all of these
new lines to learn
 before my play goes into rehearsal.
 I'm goin' in.
 If that comes any closer,
you're gonna have
 Black Hawk down on your hands.
Oh!
 What's all this?
 Official police tactical training.
 Oh, hey, dad.
Did you get a chance to sign
 that permission slip
I gave you the other day?
 Haven't you learned to forge
my signature yet?
 Ah. Credit cards? Yes.
Permission slips? No.
 It's my civics class.
 Every student has a 3-day
volunteer internship at one of
 the city's agencies...
law enforcement, sanitation, fire.
 Oh, go with fire.
They have the best calendars.
 I went with law enforcement.
 Detective Beckett
already said it's cool
 if I volunteer down at the station.
 Oh, well, as a member of
the NYPD volunteer squad,
 I would be happy
to show you the ropes.
 Actually, Detective Beckett
is giving me
 my orientation course
tomorrow morning.
 Then I would be honored
to carpool with you
 or share a cab.
 hmm.
 Castle.
 Prelim suggests the victim died
 of a single gunshot wound
to the chest at close range.
 - Any signs of struggle?
- Contusions coming up here...
 - Uh-huh.
- And here.
 But it's likely a result of his
tumble down the trash chute.
 What?
 What are you doing?
 Well, I can't breathe
through my nose.
 I happen to have
a very acute sense of smell.
 Suck it up, Castle.
Real cops deal with worse.
 Yeah, not to mention
medical examiners.
 Do you know how long
I have to shower
 before heading out on a date?
 No, but if you need someone
to time it for you,
 - I'd be happy to...
- found it!
 It must have fallen out of
his jacket on the way down.
 Yep, that's our guy.
 All right the name
is Sam Parker.
 And the driver's license has his
address placed in Connecticut.
 Maybe he's visiting
someone in the building.
 You mean dropping by?
 Ryan here.
 Thanks, bro.
 Esposito's up on 15.
 Says he found out
where our guy was shot.
 All right. Let's go.
 From the blood spatter,
our guy was shot right here.
 Then...
 He was shoved head first
down the chute.
 A kill who cleans up
after himself.
 Very "American Psycho."
 He probably wanted to get out
of the building unnoticed.
 Figured that the dumpster
wouldn't be emptied
 for a couple of days.
 He didn't count on a tenant
on the seventh floor...
 a hottie...
seeing the body drop
 As she threw out her pizza box.
 Is she distraut?
Because I can be very comforting.
 - CSUs?
- Team's on its way.
 Neighbors didn't hear the shot.
 Ah. Poor-man's silencer.
 He must have picked it up
from this pile here
 and then thrown it back
when he was done.
 Resourceful.
 How did a clean-cut suburban guy
end up this far from home
 dead and thrown out with the trash?
 Are you ready?
Here we go.
 I know Alexis
already talked to you.
 I just wanted to make sure
that you're really okay
 with having her here.
 I wouldn't have said yes
if I wasn't.
 Well, yeah, but you're busy,
 and I just don't want her
to be in the way.
 Big Castle is the one
who likes to get in the way.
 I'm sure little Castle
will be a pleasure.
 Sam Parker, age 38.
 Lives in Connecticut
with his wife Helen and his two kids.
 Wife's en route to the morgue
to ID the body.
 We contacted the leasing office,
 and they don't have a Sam Parker
listed as a tenant.
 So he probably was
visiting someone.
 Uniforms are canvassing.
No hits yet.
 CSU's working
to untangle the prints,
 but since it's a common room,
there's probably dozens of them.
 However, the chute handle,
doorknob and soda bottle
 were all wiped clean.
 All right, let's go visit
the wife at the morgue.
 Maybe she can tell us what he
was doing in the city tonight.
 And if she doesn't know,
that tells us something, too.
 Mm-hmm.
 Uh, here you go.
 Oh, fresh.
And hot and hot and hot.
 He doesn't make me coffee.
 You okay?
 It's never easy, no matter
how much experience you have.
 Oh, my God.
 I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
I am with the NYPD.
 I'm very sorry for your loss.
 Do you have any idea
who did this?
 We are doing everything
we can to figure that out.
 Um, excuse me. We're in
the middle of an identification.
 That's why she's here.
 And you are?
 I'm here to identify my husband.
 Oh, my God.
 Excuse me, your husband?
 What's your relation
to the victim?
 I'm his fiancée.
 I'm sorry.
What did you just say?
 I'm his fiancée.
 Dude, you are so busted.

 I don't even know how to
get the two of them out here.
 I'm just scared that...
 Is that our vic's wife?
 Fiancée.
 The wife is over there.
 Come again?
 Fiancée.
 - Mm-hmm.
- Wife.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh, boy.
 I know.
Isn't it delicious?
 Okay, who do we
talk to first?
 Mm. Okay.
 I know this is difficult Miss Reed,
 but if we could ask you,
a few questions.
 How long did you know
Mr. Parker?
 Parker?
 Sam.
 His name's Jake.
Jake Holland.
 Um...
 According to his, uh,
driver's license,
 It's Sam Parker.
 It was all a lie...
even his name?
 Where did the two of you meet?
 At work.
 A-a girlfriend of mine said
that there was this great guy
 in her department,
and did I want to meet him.
 - And when did you two last speak?
- This afternoon.
 He called to say he was
on his way back to the city.
 His father is
in the hospital upstate.
 He has late-stage Alzheimer's,
 and Jake would drive up
to see him every...
 I'm so stupid.
 He was spending
the weekends with...
 His wife.
 So you were intending
to see him tonight?
 We were going to get takeout
and watch a movie.
 A neighbor stopped me
in the hallway
 and told me that the police
had been there,
 but when I called,
nobody could tell me anything.
 I-I guess now I know why.
 Because we ID'ed him as Sam Parker.
 Somebody at the morgue
 confirmed that a body had been
picked up at his address,
 so I went down there.
 When he proposed,
 I told my best friend,
and she was all,
 "you've only known him
six months."
 But I didn't care.
 He was the one.
 How could he do this?
 This is insane. Who is this woman?
 Sam would never.
He... he loved me.
 Our kids meant everything to him.
 Apparently there was more to it
 than just the affair, Mrs. Parker.
 Your husband was using
a false name at his job.
 W-well, I don't understand.
Why would he do that?
 We're still trying
to figure that out.
 But from what we understand,
he met Ms. Reed at his office.
 He... he started there
about six months ago.
 He had been passed over
for promotion at his old firm.
 And there are not
a lot of opportunities
 in green solutions, so
 he took the job
even though it was in the city.
 Green solutions as in
environmentally conscious?
 He did corporate consulting...
 How to reduce waste, save energy.
 It was a passion of his.
 That's very commendable.
 Well, all that working and commuting
 were running him ragged,
so he found a cheap sublet.
 It was hard,
but if it all worked out,
 we were gonna move
down to the city
 So that we could all be together.
 Mrs. Parker, did you have any idea
 that your husband
was having an affair?
 I know what you're thinking.
 Why didn't I notice the signs?
 We have two children together.
We do not have a nanny.
 So every second
of every minute of my day
 is about my kids.
 And if the was an issue,
 I'd call Sam on his cell phone,
 and he would always answer.
 I never...
 Never thought I'd be sitting here
 justifying my marriage.
 With the wife,
 it was "only call my cell
during the week" routine.
 With the fiancée,
he pulled out the trusty
 "I can't call you
from the hospital" act.
 Man, my girlfriend freaks out
 if I don't check in, like,
every hour.
 You do check in, like, every hour.
 Sometimes more.
 This guy had both
of these women believing
 that they were his one and only.
 People believe
what they want to believe.
 Till the dead truth sets in.
 What, you think one of 'em
caught on to what Sam was doing?
 And didn't take too kindly
when they discovered
 they weren't the only woman
in his life.
 Mm. I don't know. They seem
pretty shocked to me.
 Yeah. To me, too.
 But we gotta cover all of our bases.
 Both of them had soft alibis.
 The wife said that she was
watching TV while the kids
 were upstairs sleeping,
 and the fiancée said that
she was home alone
 getting ready to meet him.
 We'll run phone and financials,
see if anything pops.
 Thank you.
 Could I run...
 Right.
 Do you think he would've
gone through with it?
 Through with what?
 Marrying Sarah,
if he hadn't gotten killed.
 Well, that was a pretty big rock
he put on her finger.
 With the fake identity
he had set up,
 the county clerk's office
never would've flagged him
 for someone
who was already married.
 Yeah, but Sam was pretending
to be Jake before he met Sarah.
 I don't understand
the fake identity.
 Maybe to land the job.
 I understand fibbing
on your résumé
 but changing your identity?
 The math doesn't quite
add up for me.
 You know what math
doesn't add up for me?
 - Hmm.
- Two wives.
 - One wife too many for you?
- Two wives too many.
 Seems like the common
denominator in that equation
 is you.
 (Regina Spektor's
"The Calculation" playing)
 ♪ you went into

 Good news.
 I'm finally embracing
the lecture you gave me
 on the importance
of organic food.
 You made my lunch?
 You think I'm gonna let you
risk your life
 on the vending machines
and stale doughnuts
 Of the break r...
 Wow.
 What?
 You look so...
Grown-up.
 Really?
 Really.
 Well, gram said
presentation is vital.
 Well...
 Oh, I forgot my phone.
 That ever happen to you
with me?
 One day, you look and you see
your boy is all grown-up?
 I'm still waiting
for that moment, actually.
 I set you up for that,
didn't I?
 Okay, so this is
the property room.
 It's where we keep
all the items
 that we find at crime scenes
 that aren't classified as evidence.
 Sort of like a lost and found?
 Um, sort of.
 Why don't the victims' families
claim this stuff?
 Well, loved ones are aware
of the big-ticket items,
 like rings and watches.
 But things like sunglasses
and lighters,
 those usually go unclaimed.
 Are these case numbers?
 Exactly. So the idea is
to get rid of
 all of this stuff
and stick it into storage.
 But before we do that,
we have to catalog it
 just in case someone comes in
with a claim.
 Okay, so you need
a description of every item,
 along with its
corresponding case number
 downloaded into the database.
 Mm-hmm. And I know
that this isn't exactly
 what you were thinking of
when you asked to volunteer,
 but we're low on manpower,
and this would be very helpful.
 Don't worry about it.
This place is gonna be
 So organized when I'm done,
you won'even recognize it.
 I bet I won't.
 - Detective Beckett.
- Huh?
 I know my dad
can sometimes be a handful.
 And by "sometimes,"
I mean all the time.
 but I want to let you know you
don't have to worry about me.
 I'm all about
getting the job done.
 - Beckett.
- Sir.
 Well?
 Alexis? She's fine.
 You know, her first day
of preschool,
 I hid outside in the bushes all day
 just to make sure
she was all right.
 The first time my son
went to summer camp,
 I followed the bus
all the way to the Adirondacks.
 You two are both either
very sweet or very creepy.
 Super let us into
Sam Parker's apartment.
 - Jake Holland's apartment.
- Same guy, bro.
 Yeah, just trying to
keep it straight for everyone.
 Anyway, there was no signs of
a struggle, and Sam's bag was...
 Jake's bag.
 Still sitting by the door
from when he came home
 from visiting his family
in Connecticut.
 Which explains why we found
the Sam Parker wallet
 on him when he was killed,
 as opposed to this one
we found in his dresser.
 Jake Holland's wallet.
 It's got his driver's license
 with his New York address,
work I.D.... the whole shebang
 Oh, please tell me
 that's the old double-sided
picture frame gag.
 The lovely fiancée, which can
easily be swapped out for...
 The wife and kids
 should they ever visit daddy
in the big city.
 The big news is, we found this
sitting on the kitchen counter.
 There's a voice mail
you're gonna want to hear.
 I'm not gonna let you
get away with this,
 you worthless piece of trash.
 If you don't call me back tonight,
 Then my next call is to Helen.
 Someone caught on
to Sam's double life.
 Ran the number. Belongs to
one Charles Depetro.
 Depetro, that's his wife's maiden name.
 It's hyphenated
on her driver's license.
 Mm-hmm.
Charlie is Helen's brother.
 He found out what Sam was up to.
 And decided to take out the trash.
 Mr. Depetro, I can understand
the instinct of protection.
 If I had a sister and her
husband was cheating on her,
 I'd want to set him straight, too.
 That's not why I left the message.
 Did you know that Sam
was cheating on Helen?
 Not until she called me last night
and told me he'd been killed.
 Then what did you mean
when you said,
 "I won't let you
get away with this"?
 He owed me money.
 So Sam borrowed money
from you?
 20 g's. He needed it
to cover the mortgage.
 He had already borrowed against
the equity in the house.
 And what was the arrangement?
 He said he needed a couple months.
 When he started the new job
in the city,
 I figured he'd be making more dough.
 Helen didn't know about this?
 He didn't want her to worry,
and as long as he paid me back,
 I said it'd be our secret.
 And did he pay any of it back?
 Not a cent. He kept saying
he was pulling in less money.
 I thought he was lying.
 Why take the job that far
from home and force Helen
 To deal with the kids on her own?
 Comes out now he wasn't
doing it for his family.
 He wanted the freedom
to cheat on my sister.
 Brother's alibi checked out.
 He was was working late
when sam/Jake was shot.
 Any word on Parkers' financials?
 Yeah, they're a paycheck away
 from defaulting on their mortgage.
 You know, the brother said
that Sam was pulling in
 less money at his new job.
If Sam was strapped for cash,
 why would he quit the job he had
to take one that paid less?
 Didn't his wife say he was
passed over for a promotion?
 Maybe it was a pride thing.
 Yeah, but you factor in
the sublet not to mention gas,
 That's a high price to pay for pride.
 Yeah, well, never underestimate
the fragility of the male ego.
 Oh, see?
That's just a stereo...
 Don't, don't. That's...
 She is baiting us, all right?
 Just ignore her.
She'll lose her witchy powers.
 You wish.
 All right. Let's go off
to Parker's office.
 Lose something?
 Um... Where... where, uh...
 Where's my broom?
 ha.
Yeah.
 I was looking.
 For the record,
I did not.
 I don't know.
Maybe I should've seen it.
 His résumé was almost
too good to be true...
 Top of his class at Berkeley,
Stanford Business School.
 He must have really needed
this job to lie so bad.
 So there's no other reason you
can think of as to why he lied?
 No.
 When you hired him, did you look
into any of his references?
 Of course I did, Detective.
I called them all myself.
 And I got nothing
but glowing recommendations.
 For a guy who didn't exist.
 I'd like to take a look
at a copy of his résumé
 if you still have it.
 I'll have human resources
e-mail it over to you.
 Uh, before we go,
did you know that Mr. Parker
 was romantically involved
with one of your employees?
 Sarah. Yeah, she's...
one of my best engineers.
 Ever notice any drama there.
 Drunken fighting at an office
party, that sort of thing?
 No, never.
 They actually seemed like
a pretty solid couple.
 And she must be
going through hell right now.
 We're sorry.
 The number you have reached
is not in service.
 Please check the number
or try your call...
 that's the last one.
 Every single reference he gave
is suddenly out of service?
 When, according to his boss,
 they were all up and running
six months ago?
 So who was answering
the dummy lines?
 Let's get a warrant
for all these numbers.
 I'd like to know
who they were registered to.
 Ok.
 This guy went to
so pretty serious lengths
 to get this job.
 They must have amazing dental.
 Eww.
 I don't know where you got
this work ethic,
 but it certainly was not from me.
 How's it going?
 Pretty good. The computer was
a little glitchy at first,
 but that's because no e
had run a software update
 in, like, two years.
 Plus, it picked up
some viruses I had to zap.
 I am realizing that you are
way overqualified for this job.
 Told you she was a smarty.
 But I do have one question.
 Like you said before,
 Most of the items here are
pretty junky and meaningless.
 I did find this, though.
 Oh, it's a brag book. So you
can brag about your kids.
 I used to have one in my wallet.
Now it's on my phone.
 Some of the pictures
are really old,
 Like they're one of a kind.
 It seems like something
worth returning,
 Only it wasn't tagged or anything.
 Yeah, but the problem is,
is without a case number,
 It's difficult to find out
who the victim was
 and how to get this back
to the family.
 Okay. So then it just goes
in the storage box, right?
 I'll tell you what..
I'll give you a list
 of all the Detectives
who possibly worked this case.
 Show them the pictures.
Maybe it'll strike up a memory.
 Only don't bother them
if they seem busy.
 You're one to talk.
 Thanks so much.
 mm-hmm. Excuse me.
 Beckett.
 - Hmm. What's this?
- Dad!
 Okay, I'll be right there.
 The fiancée's here.
She wants to talk.
 Have fun.
 I knew she looked familiar
at the morgue,
 but I couldn't place it at first.
 So you're saying
that last night
 Wasn't the first time
you had seen Helen Parker?
 Well, there was something
about her face.
 And then it hit me...
I had seen her
 in front of Jake's apartment
a couple weeks ago.
 Was she leaving the building?
 No, she was sitting
in her car across the street.
 And you're sure it was Helen Parker?
 I'm sure of it now.
 A positive identification
 from all the way
across the street in a car?
 I made a note of it because
the way she was staring at me
 was... creepy,
like she was sizing me up.
 Ms. Reed, the past 24 hours
have been...
 overwhelming to say the least.
 It's not uncommon
for witnesses' memories
 to be confused
after a traumatic event.
 We just need to be absolutely sure.
 Look, I know what I saw.
 She was sitting in a silver Hybrid
 staring at the front
of the building.
 And did you tell your fiancée
about this?
 No. At the time,
I just dismissed it.
 But now...
it makes me wonder
 if I'm the only person
in the whole situation
 Who didn't know
what was really going on.
 Silver Hybrid.
 I guess Helen did know
about her husband's affair.
 That would be
a pretty strong motive.
 You came all this way because
she told you some crazy story
 about me being parked outside
the apartment?
 Mrs. Parker, we have to take
every lead seriously.
 Did you ever think that maybe
she made this up
 to take the attention
off of herself?
 - She was specific about your car.
- A silver Hybrid? That's...
 that's like saying somebody
was wearing black shoes.
 That still doesn't answer
the question.
 No.
 In the six months
Sam had the apartment,
 I never went there.
 You never popped down
just once for a date night?
 I mean, Connecticut's
not that far a drive.
 Well, when you have 2 children
under the age of 10,
 popping down for date night
midweek is...
 Nearly impossible.
 Sam came home every weekend,
 and I would see him then.
 Okay, well,
we just needed to check.
 It's possible that Ms. Reed
was mistaken.
 Did it ever occur to you
that maybe she was the one
 that knew he was lying?
 We're considering
every scenario.
 We got a lot of hang-ups
last month.
 Do you think that's a coincidence?
 Did you tell Sam about it?
 I did. He said
it was telemarketers. But...
 it... it was her.
 How can you be sure?
 I know she has our phone number.
 She's called since Sam was killed.
 Sarah called you?
 She called about
the funeral details.
 Can you believe that?
 If she thinks she's gonna
show her face here,
 she is sadly mistaken.
 Was that the only time
you heard from Sarah?
 No, she... she called this morning
and left some ridiculous message
 about getting things back
from Sam that she had given him,
 and then on and on about some pen
 that had been her grandfather's.
 We were married for ten years
and eight months.
 If she thinks
that her 6-month affair
 can hold a candle to that...
 I'm not giving her anything.
 That was a long drive.
 I can see why he got
the apartment in the city.
 So... I did some background
on Parker's job situation.
 Turns out that his old employer,
 Connecticut Solutions,
has been circling the drain.
 Over the last couple of years,
they've lost
 half their market share
to his new employer,
 New York Recycle.
 Sounds like Sam was
abandoning a sinking ship.
 To join the winning team.
 Supposedly New York Recycle
came up with some new technology
 that turned out to be
a game changer.
 Apparently these two CEO's
have been major rivals from day one.
 Like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs,
Kobe and Lebron...
 Jolie and Aniston.
 We get the picture. Rivals.
 Yes. My point was, maybe that
why Sam faked his résumé.
 He didn't think that
New York Recycle would hire him
 if they knew he was from
Connecticut Solutions.
 Well, that makes sense.
 Thank you.
no way.
 You're kidding me.
 Uh, thank you.
You've been very helpful.
 Hey, the warrants just
came through on the numbers
 on Sam's résumé.
His references' phone numbers?
 They're all billed
and registered
 to Connecticut Solutions,
his old firm.
 Okay, why would they set up
 dummy phone lines
and give phony recommendations?
 They wanted Sam to get hired.
 He wasn't passed over
for a promotion.
 He was planted
at New York Recycle
 as a corporate spy.
 I mean, this is the guy who
organized the potato sack race
 at the labor day picnic.
 Well, there's considerable
circumstantial evidence
 that he was planted here
by his former employer.
 We just don't have
the proof yet.
 Well, obviously, no one wants
to get to the bottom of this
 more than I do.
 So you'll have
our complete cooperation.
 What do you think
Connecticut Solutions was after?
 It's our
battery recycling technology.
 I'm sure you both know
you're not supposed to dump
 your batteries
in with your trash.
 Batteries need to be
disposed of properly,
 or else the acids and the heavy
metals will leech out into...
 - And get into the water table.
- Exactly, yes.
 The problem is, storing battery
sludge can be quite expensive
 but we figured out a way
to actually recycle the stuff.
 So when you bid on a contract
to haul away old batteries,
 you can do it cheaper.
 Which is why Connecticut Solutions
 lost half of
its market share to you.
 The bottom line is,
they can't compete.
 Was Sarah Reed on the team
of engineers
 - that developed that technology?
- Yeah, that's right.
 Well, that's probably why
Sam Parker went out of his way
 To romance her... for access.
That's pretty smart.
 Pardon me,
but don't you mean despicable?
 The two aren't mutually exclusive.
 Would you mind
if our forensic IT Team
 took a look at Sarah's computer
and Sam's... Jake's... as well?
 They should be able to tell us
 whether your security
was compromised
 and whether he got ahold
of anything proprietary.
 Anything we can do to help.
 Okay, thanks.
 Forensic IT has taken possession
of Sarah and Sam's computers
 You know, there's a lot
of corporate secrets
 I could see
sending a spy to steal,
 but all this skulking around
for some battery sludge?
 Well, like the man said,
it's a business like any other.
 But whoever runs
Connecticut Solutions
 is gonna have a hell of a lot
of explaining to do.
 Is it true?
 Ms. Reed?
 What they're saying, is it true?
 Look, I can't go into details,
 but there's evidence that Jake
was trying to steal information.
 Then it was all an act?
 Now that... that doesn't mean
he didn't care about you.
 That's exactly what it means.
 He never loved me.
 He was just using me
the whole time.
 This guy was good.
 He was running
a secret e-mail client
 From inside a hidden partition
in his hard drive.
 English?
 For my partner here.
 He set things up so that
 he could send e-mails
outside of the company network
 In case anyone
ever came snooping.
 What kind of e-mails?
 I speak computer.
 This however...
 looks like chemistry.
 Was he communicating with
anyone in particular?
 Yeah.
 All these-mails were to the same guy.
 Andy Berman. He's the CEO
of Connecticut Solutions.
 He must have been
who Sam was reporting to.
 They exchanged a bunch of
e-mails a couple months ago,
 Then nothing till the night
Sam was killed.
 And what'd that one say?
 "Call me. We need to talk."
 Okay, yes, it's true.
 Sam e-mailed me the other night,
and I called him.
 From a pay phone?
 At a gas station near my house.
 Very cloak and dagger of you.
 He said he needed to
meet me in the city.
 He said he finally figured out
 how New York Recycle
was pulling it off.
 So you admit
that you planted him there
 to steal their battery technology?
 They've been underbidding us
left and right,
 Stealing our business.
 Getting our hands
on their recycling method
 was a way to level
the playing field.
 They weren't gonna share it,
so I offered Sam
 a $1-million payday
if he could get ahold of it.
 And when he called and said
he completed his mission,
 You rushed right over.
 The thing about Sam is, he and I
had been down this road before.
 What do you mean? He...
he'd told you he'd found it before?
 I wasted hundreds of thousands
on research and development
 With the stuff he brought me.
 The chemical formulas
were never complete.
 So when my engineers
tried to fill in the blanks
 and test them,
we failed every time.
 Finally, we ran out of money,
so a couple of months ago,
 I had to cut Sam loose.
 If sam wasn't working for you,
what was he calling about?
 He said he needed
to show me something.
 - What?
- I don't know.
 I drove into the city to
meet him at his apartment,
 but as I pulled up, there were
cops all over the entrance.
 I got a bad feeling about it,
 so I turned around
and I drove home.
 That's very interesting story,
Mr. Berman.
 But I have a different ending...
 One where you went upstairs
to Sam's apartment
 and he told you that he finally
found the real thing.
 You said so yourself.
 Your company didn't have
the $1 million to pay him.
 So you did the one thing
that you could.
 You killed him and you stole it
 in a desperate attempt
to save your sinking company.
 I would like to call
my lawyer now, please.
 That was pretty cool, the way
you filled in the story there.
 I think I must brubbing off on.
 That sounded dirtier
than I meant it.
 Yo Beckett,
 dispatch just got a call
out of Connecticut.
 New Haven PD have two women
involved in an altercation.
 Speaking of dirty...
 And the ladies in question
are asking for you
 Before they're taken in
for booking.
 For me, why?
 - Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
 They're holding Helen Parker
for assault
 and Sarah Reed for trespassing.
 A wife and fiancée cat fight.
 Please tell me we can stop
for popcorn on the way.
 Castle.
 Ms. Reed was trespassing
in the detached office.
 When Mrs. Parker confronted her,
an altercation ensued.
 She tried to rip my purse
off my arm.
 Almost dislocated my shoulder.
 Ms. Reed, what were you doing
in the Parkers' office?
 She wouldn't give me back my pen.
 - Your pen?
- My grandfather's fountain pen.
 - I gave it to Jake wh...
- Sam! His name was Sam!
 I gave it to him before I knew
he was a lying sack.
 And she wouldn't
give it back to me.
 I looked for it in the office.
There was nothing there.
 I have no idea
what she's talking about.
 Oh, really? Huh. Well, then
what do you call this?
 That was in the office?
 Yes. It was right there
in the drawer.
 How she could've missed it,
I don't know.
 Unless, of course, she was lying
and never bothered to look.
 Ms. Reed, I understand
how you're feeling,
 But breaking into someone's home...
 No, this is my grandfather's pen.
 I never would've given it
to Jake if I had known.
 Ladies, I'm wondering
 If maybe we can put this
whole nasty episode behind us.
 She broke into my house.
God knows what else she stole.
 Do you mind if I take
a look at the purse?
 Not at all.
 Happy now?
 Is everyone okay?
Can we all just walk away?
 If I ever catch your face
around h...
 For crying out loud,
give it a rest!
 No wonder the guy
had an ulcer.
 I would, too,
if I was married to you.
 An ulcer?
 What are you talking about,
you crazy lunatic?!
 Look! Look! Hello.
Ladies, look!
 I understand that you're both
angry and feeling betrayed,
 but taking it out on each other
 isn't going to help.
 So you can both press charges
and make a bad thing worse
 or you can calm down
and walk away.
 Option number two
is a limited-time offer.
 Aw. Love you.
 see ya.
 Please tell me you did not sleep
in the break room again.
 I went home.
 I just couldn't
stop thinking about
 that cat fight last night.
 Ooh, would you think less of me
if I said me, too?
 I kept thinking that that was
a long way for Sarah to go
 Just to pick up that pen.
 And that whole thing
with the ulcers was,,,
 Oh, I know.
 That was a great
"Desperate Housewives" moment,
 The way Sarah just rubbed
Helen's face in it.
 The thing is,
 there's nothing about an ulcer
in Lanie's autopsy report.
 Sam had a clean bill of health.
 Then what was Sarah
talking about?
 The boys are looking
into it right now.
 But according to Sam's date book
 he had doctor's appointments
every Tuesday
 for the last three weeks.
 Well, if he was being
a hypochondriac about it,
 They would've told him right
away he didn't have an ulcer.
 So what was he doing
every Tuesday at 1:00 pm?
 Another woman?
 So the doctor's office
has no patient records
 for Sam Parker or Jake Holland.
 Car service
Sam was using confirmed
 that he gave the doctor's office
as his destination
 when he was scheduling
the cars... oh, thanks, Elise.
 But I talked to the drivers.
 Sam changed the destination
once they picked him up.
 The first week he headed out
 to this residential address
out in Long Island.
 The next week he drove out
to New York Recycle's
 Processing plant up in Paramus.
 And then last week,
he hit the port out in Newark.
 Sam wouldn't have wanted Sarah
to get on to his 007 routine.
 So maybe he was slipping away
to do his spying.
 At some house on Long Island?
 -So another woman.
- She and Sam were taking
 long, romantic walks
at Port Newark.
 Why you gotta ruin the dream?
 Listen, Sam was changing
his destination last minute
 with the car service because he
was trying to hide something.
 So let's look into the addresses
 and see why he felt the need
to give Sarah a cover story.
 State law requires
a 10-minute break
 every five hours.
 Thanks, dad. I needed this.
 So how goes your
property room sleuthing?
 Not amazing.
 Oh, no.
What happened to that,
 Uh, list of Detectives
Beckett gave you?
 I just hit
my last dead end.
 Oh, well, what's important is,
is that, uh, you tried.
 I know.
 I just really wanted
to get those pictures
 back to the victim's family.
 I mean, I'd want them
if they were pictures
 that you'd carried around.
 If you are imagining
a scenario where I am
 No longer here and watching over
your every move
 and protecting you
from every danger,
 I can assure you,
that will never happen.
 I'm just saying,
I think it's important.
 No, you're right,
but remember,
 There's a reason why a lot
of this stuff goes unclaimed.
 I guess I just need
to focus on cataloging
 for the rest of my time here.
 And before you know it,
 you'll be retired
from law enforcement
 and back in the eleventh grade.
 Thanks, dad.
 For what? You're wcome.
 You just gave me a new lead.
 So I'll finish your cocoa.
 Two relationships.
 Can you imagine the stress
of trying to pull that off?
 Yes.
 Uh, from a literary point of view.
 Hey. What'd you guys find?
 Well, we canvassed
using a picture.
 We came up with a longshoreman
in Port Newark
 who remembered Sam.
 Apparently he'd been asking
about shipping manifests.
 Sounds random.
 The longshoreman couldn't
help him, so Sam moved on.
 What about the address
from the first Tuesday?
 Oh, here's where gets good.
 The Long Island address
 is the ridence of a single mother...
 Lauren Branston...
and her 6-year-old daughter.
 I told you it was another woman.
 Our love triangle
just became a love square.
 Nope. Still a triangle.
Different name, but that's...
 The fiancée, Sarah Reed.
 Well, it looks like Sam
 wasn't the only one
hiding his identity.
 The engagement, the relationship,
 we know they were all fake.
 Love is a hard thing
to disprove, Detective Beckett.
 This is a copy
of your real driver's license.
 And this is
your social security card.
 And this is the employment
record from New York Recycle
 Under an assumed identity.
 Nothing like a fresh start.
 We did a little digging.
 Turns out New York Recycle
isn't the first company
 you've worked for
under a new identity.
 A girl's gotta make a living.
 Here's what I'm thinking...
 Lance Carlberg figured out
that Sam was a spy.
 He contacted you, an expert
in corporate espionage,
 And asked you to intercept him.
 I was just doing my job.
 Leading a man on isn't
a crime, is it, Detective?
 Should be.
 I'm not looking into
the leading on part.
 I'm looking into a murder,
 And you had access
to Sam's apartment,
 And you were hired
to take care of him.
 I was hired to get in his way.
 It was supposed to look
like I had access
 to classified information.
 So when I struck up
a flirtation, he thought
 the relationship would give him
the access he needed.
 Once you had the relationship,
what was the plan?
 I just had to leave my laptop
 lying around his apartment
once or twice.
 My keycard ended up
in his laundry one weekend.
 Men think they're smart.
 The trick is to keep
letting them think it.
 Um... So what was on
the computer?
 Lance was feeding Sam these
partial chemical formulas.
 He thought it would keep
 Connecticut Solutions
going in circles.
 Why not kill two birds
with one stone?
 Keep the enemy close and run
Connecticut into the ground.
 And what makes you think
 That Sam was falling
for your routine?
 Well, I wondered at first,
 Because he wouldn't sleep with me.
 And then I realized that he was
being faithful to his wife.
 So I pretended to buy his whole
"I'm old-fashioned" thing.
 He thought he was playing me.
 He was.
 This is Sam's autopsy report.
 Hmm.
Sam didn't have an ulcer.
 He was seeing a doctor for it.
 No, that was just a story.
He made you.
 No way. I would've
been able to tell.
 Oh, I hate to burst this little
"alias" bubble you got going on,
 But Sam found your house
in Long Island.
 He knew you were more than
just a flirty engineer.
 He played along
not to arouse suspicion,
 But I think you already knew that.
 You knew that he made you
and that he found
 the secret method,
and that's why you killed him.
 I think that sounds like a...
 great spy versus spy story,
 but there is one problem.
 The night Sam was killed,
I was at my daughter's recital,
 and there's about 20 other
parents that can vouch for that.
 I like her... for the murder.
 You see that crazy look in her eye?
 That's crazy-killer look.
 Yo,
Sarah's alibi checks out.
 Dance teacher puts her
in the front row
 - at the time of the murder.
- She's still got crazy eyes.
 He never loved her,
she never loved him,
 and they both thought that
they were playing each other.
 Which still doesn't explain
who killed him.
 We're missing something.
 The pen.
 If Sarah's relationship
with Sam was a fake...
 then why did she give him
her grandfather's special pen?
 And what was Sarah
really looking for
 in Sam's office last night?
 Nothing.
This doesn't make any sense.
 We went through Sarah's purse.
 If there was something in it,
we would've found it.
 Castle, what are you doing?
 I'm writing a scene.
 Let's say Sarah found
 what it was she was looking for.
 She had it in her hand.
 That's when she would've heard
Helen coming out of the house.
 She would've had to have
 gotten rid of whatever it was
that she found...
 Great. You want to write
the part where we find it?
 So Helen would never know.
 Ah. What do you know?
 Power mode is still on.
 We're gonna need some tape.
 These are the pics
that our vic took
 while he was supposedly
at the doctor.
 According to
New York Recycle, they ship
 their battery sludge up to
the recycling plant in Paramus.
 You don't need a boat
to get to Paramus.
 Secret method, my ass.
They weren't processing it.
 They were switching labels
and dumping it.
 That Sam was quite
the Erin Brockovich, wasn't he?
 There was no secret
method to battery recycling.
 You shipped the sludge out
on cargo barges
 and dumped it in the ocean.
 The money you saved
on storage and processing
 you just put into
your own pocket instead.
 Listen, I know my rights.
 And I don't
have to say anything.
 You sold a bill of goods
to your customers.
 You promised them that they
were gonna help save the world.
 Instead you poisoned it for money.
 What happened, Carlberg?
 Sam confront you,
threaten to ruin you?
 I didn't kill anyone.
 And you...
 You have no proof.
 Actually, I do.
 We ran ballistics.
It's a match.
 We found it in the dumpster
outside your apartment building.
 Had you recycled, you might
have gotten away with it.
 (Mads Langer's "Fact Fiction"
playing)
 The night
that your husband was murdered,
 He went back to his office
 to grab the last few pieces
of evidence he had collected,
 and by then, Carlberg had
already become suspicious.
 When he realized that your husband
 was contacting his old boss for
help in exposing his company,
 Carlberg attempted
to buy his silence,
 but Sam wouldn't accept the bribe.
 Of course not. Not Sam.
 You said that the environment
 was the most important thing
to your husband.
 Well, he died trying to save it,
 and we thought
that you should know that.
 Thank you.

 Really?
How'd you track 'em down?
 It was something
you said, dad,

from law enforcement.
 It got me thinking,

 Nice work.
