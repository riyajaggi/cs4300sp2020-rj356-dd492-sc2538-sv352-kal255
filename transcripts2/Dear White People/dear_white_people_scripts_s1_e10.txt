 [Troy] How are you gonna feel when AP is gone and it's your fault? Troy, people have tried that before. It didn't happen then, and it won't happen now. And I will not be bought. Fine. But I'm gonna fight you on this. Bring it. [door closes] [narrator] Samantha White... on the eve of the biggest moment of her political career at Winchester,

 and yet there was only one thing on her mind... Gabe Mitchell. He prided himself on always doing the right thing. But for once, he had no idea what that was. -[ringing] -[cell phone vibrating] [beeps] [cell phone vibrating] [narrator] Reggie Green... finally at the center of a grand call to action, and yet he can't even get his calls returned. Lionel Higgins, though he's used to feeling small... -Yo. -Hey, just making sure I'm good to stop by today for the article. -Yeah, sure. -[Coco] Are you fucking kidding me?

 What was that? ...today, he's on the verge of something big. Drama. See you in a bit. -That's a relationship. -That's a delusion. [narrator] Coco Conners and Troy Fairbanks-- they could have been big, but with their town hall and its impending protest, one thing remained out of reach-- unity. [Run the Jewels' "Legend Has It" playing] [bird cawing] ♪ Hear what I say We are the business today ♪ ♪ Fuck shit is finished today... ♪ All right, y'all, up next, as promised, the man whose personal tragedy led us all to protest-- Mr. Reggie Green. ♪ Doctors of death Curing our patients of breath... ♪ So I'm just gonna read my poem... if that's cool. Sam? That cool? Sounds great. Um, I'll be right back. Is there a button I'm supposed to push or something? -[door opens] -Bitch, you got a Super Plus? Aunt Flo is in town, and she brought all her kids. Oh! Hey, Reg. What you doing here? Supposed to be a guest on this show, but Sam just left me hanging. She does that. Here, let me help you. -Sorry. -Yeah. Uh, so this fades the music down, and that's your mic. Okay. [Reggie clears throat] Uh, this is Reggie Green... and here's something that I wrote. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal... that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights... He's here promoting the protest. Yeah, of course he is. [sighs] I really don't know why I came here. I'm really glad you did. I've been calling you. Yeah, I know. I didn't really want to talk, but I heard your voice on the radio, and... Fuck, Sam. You did the right thing... the night of the party. It wasn't fair the way we treated you. I should have said something. White skin, light-skinned, but for me not the right skin. I have never... said "I love you" to... anyone before you. And I know I'm not good at any of this stuff, but I want to be. Why'd you sleep with him? [stammers] I really tried to convince myself that you didn't. But I know you did. I just-- I just want to know why. We shouldn't have done that. I needed to know for sure what I wanted. Well, that's a hell of a litmus test. Gabe, I love you. [Sam] I want this. Do you? I don't know. I shouldn't have come here. Gabe. [Reggie] Nothing self-evident about it. Thanks. Hope to see y'all at the protest. [Joelle] Reggie, that was so powerful. I have a good feeling about tonight. -I really do. -[Reggie] I hope you're right. I'm sorry. All good... thanks to Joelle. I finished him off-- um, helped him. I'm gonna stop talking now. My mouth is broken. What was that? What do you think? Thanks for dropping by, Reggie. [sniffles] Ay. You good? Say something funny and specific. Is it just me, or is Drake's entire career a response to that episode of Degrassi when he was in the wheelchair and couldn't get it up? Yeah, we get it, Drake. You fucks. [both laugh] What am I doing, Jo? What did you do, Sam? [knocks on glass] Am I late? This isn't another Troy article, right? Am I the villain in another article about Troy? No, it's an obligatory, just-the-facts report on the town hall. I wanted your perspective. So your protest is just a few hours away. What are your objections to the town hall? Have you been to a Winchester town hall? They're so regimented even Kim Jong-un is like, "Guys, chill. Let somebody talk." But we can't be swept under the rug this time. I don't care what bullshit Troy and Coco are peddling for the dean. What do you mean by that? Um... Off the record. They came in here talking about some big donors trying to break up AP if I go through with the protest. -Whoa. -Yeah. But that's nothing new. The minute black kids sit together in the cafeteria, white folks cry self-segregation. Never mind that white people have always sat together and always will. I'm going through with this, Lionel. I have to. I can't let everybody down. You won't. You have the guts to say what needs to be said. Something I can never seem to do. Who led a group of AP kids over to bust up a blackface party? You're braver than you think. The Hancocks? Students don't get to meet the Hancocks. This is the inner, inner circle. [Lionel] The Hancocks are into a whole lot of hooey. Say "shit" just once. It seems benign, but they fund cases that are against affirmative action, against voter rights for minorities, against-- Lionel, this wasn't your assignment. This is bigger than my assignment. The administration is in bed with bigots. Look at this. Every year the Hancocks give ten million-- The Hancocks are absolutely off-limits. Why? This is the Independent. We can go after whoever we want. This paper is independent of Winchester because it's paid for by its founders, the Hancocks. Just once can you focus on the story I assigned you? [Lionel] Fine. I'll see you at the town hall. How about "fuck"? Can you say "fuck"? No. [bell tolling] Hey. Where do the town hall guests enter? Side entrance. Coco, you're here? Am I supposed to be home, devastated? Oh, you know what? I'm fresh out of fucks to give. -Do you have any fucks? -No fucks here. -Do you have any fucks? -[all] No. -Do you have any fucks? -No, ma'am. Troy, we are all out of fucks. I have gum, though. So this is how they want us to run this, guys-- Troy, I started already, because you were late. As the students file in, try to identify the ones with likely harmless questions. Troy will make sure those are the only ones who get the mic. I'll cut us off after 30 minutes. The dean will protest and act like he could go all night, and then I'll allow one more question. It works every time. [chuckles] So we're gonna silence our own? Listen, guys, I know that this doesn't sound pretty, but this is how real change begins, slowly from within. Now, I know it feels like the protesters out there are brave. Believe me, it is easy to scream into the night. I don't even know what to say. I don't need your permission to take my time. I'm taking my time. Okay, you're arguing with a phone. Just don't respond. Or maybe a quick response like, "Okay, thanks." Or a one-word response. Or even one letter. "K" with a period. Guys don't say "K." "K," I'm gonna say... [clamoring] [Joelle] Those goddamn ellipses are some bullshit. My blood pressure is sky high. That's all them nuggets and McRibs. Fuck. I don't know what to say. All I know is that she's the only girl I've ever loved. Then go to her. But she slept with him. You're right. Tell her to kick rocks. But am I ready to just let go what we had? I can't say all that in a text message. Go to her? You're right, I should. Thank you, Milo. Anytime. [chattering] [whispering] [protestors shouting] All right, what's the situation outside? I know there's a lot riding on quelling the protest. I tried to talk to Sam. But he failed and then gave up. Come on, you know what's at stake. I pieced together what the Hancocks want out of this. Troy... I'm sure there's something else you can do. [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! -Clifton, what is this? -Much respect, dawg, but binge drinking is the deadliest challenge facing Winchester, and the administration won't acknowledge it. Nigga, really? Troy, that's really racist. And from our Student Body President, no less. To think, I voted for you. [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink. [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! What in white hell? They feel binge drinking is taking a back seat. They're "All Lives Mattering" this shit? This ain't even what Thane would have wanted. That motherfucker loved binge drinking. Sam, it's not too late. Just come inside, please. Are you gonna give us the floor to say what we want? You know I can't do that. Then what are you doing, Troy? [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! Hey, just checking in. Everything okay? Uh, where's Troy? I'll go check on him. [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! [Clifton] Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die-- I couldn't find him. What is wrong with that boy? I've done everything. I've pushed him. I've brought him in. Dean, I got this. Hi. I'm Coco Conners, and on behalf of CORE and the entire faculty at Winchester, I'd like to welcome you. Tonight we're discussing race and safety on campus. While some prefer to rail against a system -that's trying to help... -Mm. ...you should all applaud yourselves for having the courage to listen as well as speak. Thank you, Coco. Now let's open this up for questions. [audience murmuring] [mouths word] Hi. Kelsey Phillips, AP resident, and I'm a psych major. -Actually, I wanted to talk about that. -Kels. Right. I wanted to say thank you so much for my comfort dog. -Oh, you're welcome. -[laughs] Go on. That's all. Okay! Anybody with a question? [audience murmuring] Yes, you, sir. [crowd shouting] Can you feel this? Everyone here for you? Not everyone. [Sam] When are you gonna grow up, Troy? What the fuck is going on? I mean, like-- It's always something with her. [all] No one else should die from drink! Reggie, I know it sucks to want something from someone they're not willing to give you... but you got to let it go. Trust me. [all] No one else should die from drink! They're just gonna drown you out out here. Better to get drowned than to be silenced. -[feedback whines] -We pay tuition to this place! [all] Get your guns up out my face! [Sam] We pay tuition to this place! [all] Get your guns up out my face! We pay tuition to this place! [all] Get your guns up out my face! [Sam] We pay tuition to this place! Uh... [clears throat] I just have a question that I think is on everyone's lips. Why is campus security armed at all? Well, that's a great question. As part of our university policy, we make a promise to our students and to their parents to keep everyone safe. [woman] Reggie didn't feel too safe! Okay, we're almost out of time. Oh, no, already? Surely we could have one more. One more. [audience murmuring] [Coco] Here you go, sweets. We pay tuition to this place! [all] Get your guns up out my face! We pay tuition to this place! [all] Get your guns up out my face! Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! Winchester, stop and think! [all] No one else should die from drink! We pay tuition to this place! [all] Get your guns up out my face! [Kurt] Black lives matter! So do blue! We got shit to whine about, too! Black lives matter! So do blue! We got shit to whine about, too! Black lives matter! So do blue! We got shit to whine about, too! Oh, for fuck's sake. [muffled shouting continuing] Lionel Higgins, sophomore. Just a quick question for President Fletcher. How much money are we worth to you? I'm sorry, young man? -What the fuck is this? -Taking a stand. You're stomping on an already marginalized-- Cut the shit, Sam! So a few dumb kids offended you by accident. Was that worth all of this? What I hear Lionel saying is-- There are 234 black undergrads on this campus. That's roughly $55 million, assuming we make it all four years. And yet you're willing to disregard our right to safe spaces? What are you talking about? The Hancocks! So, because I call it out, racism is my fault? Think about that night with Reggie. Everyone at that party-- hell, this whole campus-- has been on edge because of you. [Lionel] The namesake of this very hall. I wonder if anyone here knows just how much power this administration is willing to give them over a $10 million donation, especially when this school's endowment is $14 billion! With a B! [mouthing words] The truth is you like things to be fucked up so you have a machine to rage against, Sharpton. None of this is a threat to you because you already have the power, Kurt. Can't you see that? Just ask yourself, has anything that you've done actually made things better? Has it? We could have been allies, Sam. But you was tripping. In fact, because of the protest outside, they're using their money to blackmail the administration into integrating Armstrong-Parker. How the hell did he know that? That's enough, young man. Right about... now, you should all be receiving an alert from the Winchester Independent website. There you can read all about this! -[cell phones chiming] -[chattering] [shudders] It's crazy. Everyone decided to piggyback off my protest, because God forbid black people say anything without-- Oh, forget it. I'm so glad you're here. I couldn't let Reggie down. And they put their name on our new student center? I set 'em, you spike 'em. Seeing what you did to your son, I imagine it involves brainwashing. He invited me to some big donor thing because he wants me to get more involved. And less like a puppet. Look, nigga, you're gonna hit these ivy-lined streets, and you're gonna leave neither hand unshaken or baby unkissed. Yes, sir. -[man] What the fuck? -[shouting] What part of "the Hancocks are off-limits" possessed you to post a story about the motherfucking Hancocks? Silvio, can you shut up? Do you even know how much shit I'm gonna be in? What'd you say? I said, can you shut the fuck up? [overlapping shouting] [lock rattling] It's like nothing about our relationship has been easy. Who said it was supposed to be easy? No one. I just know it doesn't have to be this hard. -Listen, I just-- -No, you listen. This is important to me. And if you want me on the Independent, these are the types of stories I'm gonna write. And if you don't like it, then you can just go fuck-- The more I think about it... the more I know that... this won't work. [overlapping shouting] Everyone, calm the fuck down! [overlapping shouting] [all gasp] Oh, my God. Hands behind your back. Let's go. [Troy] Get off! Off of me! Get your hands off me! [man] Don't resist! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! -That's my son! -Dad, I'm cool. I'm cool. [man] Clear a path. Go. -[Troy] It's okay. -[man] Clear a way. -[Troy] Everyone, it's okay. -[man] Move. [Troy] I'm fine. [man] Move back, people. [chattering] [Troy] Everything's fine. [chattering] -[car door opens] -Sam... -[car door closes] -He's okay. [engine turning over] He's okay. [siren wailing] [Sam] He's okay. [Reggie] Can't believe Troy gets arrested for the movement before I do. [Joelle] You've done your share for the movement, Reggie. So what now? Well, it is Wednesday. Olive, what have you done? I-I killed him. But he was the vice president's clone! [excited chatter] Defamation night is basically the epicenter of black life at Winchester. Hmm. The more you know. Okay, if I don't ask you this, it's gonna bug me all night. You and Sam-- is that a thing? Absolutely not. Anyone sitting here? What a shitshow, huh? First few seasons were solid, then it just... went off the rails. I meant-- Yeah, tonight. I'm trying to block it out. I think we all are. How did we end up pitted against each other? I always thought it was because of you. Really, bitch? You see, it's that. That right there. [chuckles] You're not wrong. You think they'll do it? Take AP from us?
