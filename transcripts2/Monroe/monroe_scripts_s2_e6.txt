 Monroe (2011â€“2012): Season 2, Episode 6 - Episode #2.6 - full transcript 
 Monroe introduces medical student Jacob Namobu to the ward as Jenny,having learned of Lawrence's infidelity from Monroe,tells him they should split up and a guilty Sarah tenders her resignation. On the eve of his wedding Nick tells his father he has doubts about going through with it but a family party is interrupted following a traffic pile-up and the need for all surgical staff to operate on the victims. When one dies Jacob has doubts about the job but is counselled by Monroe. Jenny refuses to accept Sarah's resignation and it is Lawrence who moves on whilst Springer actually admits his feelings for Sarah. Next day Monroe finds that Anna has talked Nick into getting married and they both attend his wedding.

 You had a one-night stand. Stop blaming how bad you feel on her. He's getting none, you're sleeping with your ex, no wonder there's a recession. I think we should just be friends. Great. Good. But unless Springer is the love of your life, he isn't worth the pain. What about this? Is this funny? Would I have hit Shepherd if I wasn't your mate? I think he may have had an affair with Sarah Witney. Mike Law, aged 30. We removed an acoustic neuroma two days ago and preserved both his hearing and his facial nerve. Which basically means he can still smile when he hears us tell him he's good-looking.

 Duncan West, aged 42. Arrived two nights ago. Thought he was having a stroke. Our old friend the cerebral aneurysm. Called it, coiled it and Duncan's started to hate the sight of us. Wilf Hazelhurst, aged 65, has early onset Alzheimer's and a meningioma. Mr Hazelhurst plays the piano and his playing is unaffected by the Alzheimer's. His wife, Olive, is anxious that tomorrow's brain surgery doesn't damage his musical gift. And he doesn't like being in pyjamas, so we're going with smart casual for now. Any questions? I thought not. Good. Just one. Who is this guy? This is Jacob Namobu. A medical student, thinking of neurosurgery. He is in perfect health. Make sure he is returned that way at the end of the shift.

 Where are you going to be? At home, hosting my son's stag night. You are well and truly on your own, Jacob. Don't believe a word Springer says and hold on tight. You're in for the ride of your life. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. So you like playing the piano? What did you say your name was? Mr Springer. What did he say his name was? Do you remember that you are going to have an operation? Voluntary mutism. He tends to be like that with patronising twats. Hello, Mr Hazelhurst. Hello, Lizzie, lass. Where have you been hiding? That's me. I'm gone. Don't be late. I thought Nick didn't want a stag night. He doesn't. But, you know, I can't send him to his fate without marking the occasion. Are there any special qualities you want me to look out for in our lab rat? When Alex Ferguson first laid eyes on Ryan Giggs, he said, 'He floated over the ground like a cocker spaniel chasing a piece of silver paper in the wind.' You both remember my pilot scheme is coming to an end, don't you? My Head of Clinical Services position. I'd like to think you'd support its extension. You'd like to think that. That's self-evident. It's online. If you'd care to give me your support. You enjoyed that a bit too much. I take my pleasure where I can. Oh, erm... I haven't forgotten about tonight. I might be a bit late cos we've got Relate first but I will be there. How's that going, back home? Well, yeah. Yeah, really well. And you and Bremner? It's good? Yeah. Yeah, we're doing just fine. Great. I'll see you later. You just think about what you're doing. You're throwing everything away. I just can't come in every day and face Bremner. Or Shepherd. Did you explain the real reason for leaving? I just said it was for family reasons. Which it is, in a way. What does your boyfriend think? He doesn't know yet. He'd only try and talk me out of it. Neurosurgery is all about character. You need the wisdom of Buddha, the courage of a lion and the touch of a woman. Hi there. This is Miss Witney, Cardiac Surgical Registrar. And Mr Mullery, General Surgery Registrar. This is Jacob Namobu, the Mowgli to my Bagheera. Borderline racist but that's progress of sorts. Well, what can I say? I don't see colour. You opt for neuro, Jacob, and many years of study and hard work might get you the chance of dating a woman as hot as that. That would be nice. This better be good. I'm already running late. Ah... You got it. Custom-made. Wilf? Can I help you? They said you needed your radiators bleeding. I'm on my way out. Off duty an hour ago. And so are you. You do remember that the pilot scheme comes to an end next week. What pilot scheme is this of which you speak? There are so many, it gets quite confusing. I knew it would happen one day. You are going to heal the sick with the power of song. My daughter doesn't use it any more. Wilf might like it. Were you a singing nun or was that just a dream I had? You know, the music, the moonlight, the wimple. I thought just Catholic boys dreamt of stuff like that. I'm very inclusive when it comes to sexual fantasy. Too much information. OK, huge pile-up. M62. We have an RTA passenger. Could be the first of many. Joey Shaw, 40, admitted through A&E.; I stabilised him and ordered an emergency CT scan. Good call, Mr Mullery. Thank you, Mr Springer. And the driver? He's a bit out of it. Wilson has ordered him a scan. Drink? He says not, but then he did cause the pile-up, so he would, wouldn't he? You going to call Monroe back in? And ruin my first solo flight? No way. Let's see where they send the rest of the casualties. Jacob. There's the extra-dural overlying the transverse sinus and it may be occluding it. So how is the blood draining from the brain? Is draining down the opposite transverse sinus and down the sigmoid to the internal jugular? Yes. Good. Good. You ever see a craniotomy before? No. Make sure you bring your sick bag, my friend, because you are about to lose your neuro-cherry! Hang in there, Joey. They got drugs in here like you wouldn't believe. Go on, Joey, mate. He'll be sound, won't he? Don't worry. We'll remove the clot on his brain. It's his 40th, so do a good job and all that, won't ya? Yeah. Text me, later, love, with the final score. We've booked you a scan. Don't leave. I've told you. There's nothing wrong with me. Blinding headache. Lost the steering wheel. Next minute I know it's heavy metal time and I wake up with five cars piled up around me. I'm fine now. What sort of headache? Kind that makes you drive like Wacky Races. There's something I need to ask you. You said you haven't been drinking. Have you been taking drugs? No. Nothing at all? Well, I always do a line of whizz on a Friday night. But that's not taking drugs, is it? It's more of a livener. Happy birthday, Joey. Are we good to go? Yep. Blade me, cool breeze. Knife, please, nurse. Before you get married tomorrow, I'll tell you three things that make life worth living. Please don't. Old Trafford before the start of the season, the first cleavage in springtime and an unopened deck of cards. Dad. Marriage is a lot like poker. Don't go aggressive on a dud hand. Don't get sucked into putting money in to see the flop. I don't think I should get married. To get out of your stag night? No, I mean it, Dad. I think you're right. Me and Donna. It's all too soon. Nah... Its nerves, son. Its just nerves. I was nervous when I married your mum. I was nervous during the service with her dad's shotgun trained on me, especially as he had Parkinson's. That's one for the neurosurgeons in the audience. You're supposed to laugh. This is some of my best material for the speech tomorrow. Nick? Are you serious? I thought you'd be glad. All your arguments finally got through to me. Oh, son. You seemed so certain. Look, if you don't want to get married tomorrow, that's fine. Really. Whatever your choice, I'll back you up. All right? Hadn't you better answer that? No. I'll send them away, we'll sit down, we'll talk it through. You know what? Let's play. Let's play now and we'll talk later. Maybe I'm just thinking too much. OK. We're ready to take the bone flap away. Whoa! More blood than expected. You removed the tamponade effect. He's removed the clot. It was a plug. Yeah, I know. Patties and Surgicel. We need to soak this up and wait for the clot to form. There's been an RTA on the M62. Not clear how many casualties they are bringing yet. Springer's working on the first now. I'll take my phone. Call me if you need me to open a second theatre. OK. You haven't forgotten, have you? No. No, I haven't forgotten. Well, we can't be late for counselling. It looks like we don't care. I don't think we should go any more. Really? Well, I know it's tough but... I just don't think there's any point in going if you are going to carry on lying to me. Lying to you? What do you think I've been lying to you about? About sleeping with Witney. About that. How long have you known? For certain? About a week. For certain? What does that mean? Somebody told you? Why is that important? You know. I know. So why haven't you said anything till now? Because I thought, fondly, that I could bury it. Carry on. Carry on as though nothing had happened. Right. But I found I couldn't do that. Because I looked at you and realised how naive I was to imagine that the secret wouldn't just make me hate you. Right. I see. God, I'm sorry. What do you want to do? How do you want to sort this? You leave. I stay. We try and be good parents to our son. How about I stay? We work on our relationship. I mean, the worst is behind us. My madness, my stupidity. It's over. I ended it. Please, Jenny. So I should stay with you so your sacrifice wasn't in vain? You know what I mean. I don't know anything. You presented one version of yourself, which turns out to be false. So I don't know what you mean or don't mean. You know me. You know me better than anyone else. You understand me better than anyone else. Neither are good enough reasons to carry on damaging each other. I know... I know you're angry. You've every right. But I am begging you, please. We can work this out. When we first met, you promised me that my opinion of relationships had been coloured by my unfortunate experiences. And I chose to believe you. I now see that I was mistaken to do so. Well, maybe... er, maybe there's a reason for that. What are you implying? Perhaps you just can't be loved. Perhaps you are incapable of having a relationship. Perhaps I am just one in a long line of men who died trying! OK. Big blind a fiver. Small blind 2.50. No smoking at the table, no jokes about honeymoon night. I don't want him embarrassed. Are you old enough to get married? Or do Mum and Dad have to sign something? I'll bet. Them might not be the only cards you're looking at this month, hey, boss? I'll call. What's that supposed to mean? The pilot scheme is coming to an end. Alistair may no longer be our boss. How long has that been? 10 minutes. Not long enough. You've not packed it for long enough. Yeah, OK. No clot formed. Let's pack the brain. Get another transfusion into him. And you can cut out the sideways glances. I'm on top of this. I'll call and raise a fiver. Why are you jacking it in? I'm not. This is just Monroe's way of saying that the decision will be taken after consultation with senior staff. His fate is in my hands. That's you screwed, then, boss. Yeah, well, it's either me or a jobsworth with a degree in management from the University of Up Your Own Arse. Enjoying your stag night, Nick? Can you live with the sharp banter? First stag do I've been to with the groom's parents there. It's not a stag do. I'll fold. I hope he's a bit more animated when the strippergram arrives! Hello? Gillespie. Yep. I can't keep wasting all that blood on transfusions, when it's just pouring out of him for fun. I'm trying to find the bleeder. I think we should call Monroe. No. The patient's either going to arrest or be killed by an air embolus. Mary. Call Monroe. He's bleeding out. You can't pull rank. I'm the registrar. I'm not pulling rank. Your anaesthetist is. Pack the brain. Tell Springer not to go near it. Sorry, folks, huge RTA, got to go. Tell A&E; I'll be there in 20 minutes. Just so I know, did anyone have better than four of a kind? I want to come in too. Yeah. And me. Don't want to miss the excitement. Straight flush since you're asking. Want us to strip you naked and tie you to a lamppost before we go? No. I'm fine. I'm missing out but I'll live with it. See you. That's one of your wedding presents. You can open it. It's a computer game based on marriage counselling with guns and ho's. It's educational. Thanks. Sounds perfect. And the other thing we were talking about... Are you good or less than good? I'll talk to Mum. Anna, talk him but don't decide anything. Sorry again. It's... An emergency. This is like my childhood played out in one moment. Hah! Suppose we'd better cancel the pizza. Let's not be hasty. Where's my husband? Where's my husband? They brought my son in an ambulance and no-one can tell me where my husband is. Jill? I'll find out. Tell me where they are. Monroe. I've got a teenager with chest, abdo and head injuries. One in theatre. The driver is confused, so we've ordered him a CT scan. I've got a lorry driver with suspected ruptured spleen, so ordered him a CT scan. Two vehicles... Love your eye for detail but I've got to go. I'll send Wilson to the briefing. Someone please take Mr Hazelhurst back to the Cottingley Ward. Excuse me, sir... OK. The cavalry is here. Wilson, scrub out, get to the Ilkley Room. We need to know our priorities. Springer, clear the wound of swabs. He starts to bleeds out. So I'm not here under false pretences when I should be at home with a royal flush. Do it! In the second vehicle, the Dawlish family... The mother has got away with a fractured clavicle. The father, Steven, has chest and lung injuries. The son, Luke Dawlish, 16 years old, has got the worst of it. Three injuries all needing surgery. A CT scan confirms severe abdominal bleeding and he's got a head injury. Skull fracture and subdural hematoma. Cardiac takes priority. The CT also shows the aorta bulging and blood washing around the left chest. All right. That means we go first, Miss Witney. Anything else? We've got a lorry driver with suspected ruptured spleen. Pretty straightforward. Not really. He weighs 24 stone. The bleeding's stopped. Yes. My mere presence has caused the blood to clot. Unless there's some other explanation. I didn't leave enough time. Too impatient. You were showing off. Possibly for young Jacob here. - Well, not exactly showing off. From one flash bastard to another, take the blame and move on. Fix the dura with poppen suture. I want the bone fixed with titanium plates, Springer. Really? Yes, unless you want to knit him a chainmail balaclava. No, I mean, you still trust me to do that? You asked for help when you needed it. That's the moral of the story. Besides, there's five carloads of bodies in A&E.; You've plenty of chance to redeem yourself before the end of the night. The kid with multiples. I hear the heart is first up. I take it you're doing the lot. She knows. Jenny knows... about me and Witney. She's known for about a week. I know. I'm sorry. What do you mean you know? I know because I told her. Why the fuck would you do that to me? Look, Larry, lying wasn't doing any good. She'd worked it out for herself. And maybe it's good if the truth is out. Why do you never answer your phone? Another ambulance arriving in 10 minutes. Give me a second! When did you become the poster boy for honesty, huh? You've screwed my relationship. You've screwed my family. You've screwed everything! Apart from Witney. Who you screwed in case it slipped your mind! Mr Monroe! I'm coming. All right. I'm coming! Take that, thank you. Hold that back for me. Your son, Luke, is in theatre having heart surgery and he'll need two more emergency operations after that. Your husband's stable, but I'm afraid he's going to need an operation too. If we'd had a better radio, this wouldn't have happened. I'm sorry? Luke sits in the front because he can't hear the radio in the back. If we'd had better speakers, it would've been me. Don't sit here worrying about 'If only's'. Why not? It's either that or scream the place down. I'll do that if you'd rather. You do whatever makes you feel better. I'll come and find you when he's out of surgery. OK? OK. How's the blood pressure? OK. Thank you. I'll open the pericardium, check for further damage there, then repair the aorta. It may well need a graft by the looks of the scans. Yes. Right. Yes. Yes, I'll send her. Thank you. That was Mullery from A&E.; He wants you to go down for a suspected tamponade. Right now, please. Go. Thank you, Miss Witney. Right, let's crack on. This young man's got another two ops to endure before the night's out. What are we looking at now? Springer was treating the passenger. This is the driver. I thought the driver wasn't hurt. He wasn't. Not by the crash at least. Not a mark on him but he was a bit incoherent, so I ordered a CT scan. Something's given him a brain haemorrhage if it wasn't the crash. Amphetamine abuse. He's been regularly taking speed since the late '80s. Ah, Madchester. So much to answer for. I admitted him. I'll talk to him about his lifestyle. No. You need to get back to A&E.; I know just the person to give him a lifestyle chat. I thought them headaches were getting worse. You know what I mean? Taking speed will do that. Well, they call me Buzz for a reason. Well, you got yourself a brain haemorrhage for your trouble, so maybe they'll call you 'Brain Damage' instead. You're hardly Florence Nightingale, you, are you? Sorry. I tend more towards the Kathy Bates in Misery school of nursing for those who drive under the influence. Never crashed till tonight, though, did I? So, maybe it wasn't the whizz. There's a young lad hanging on to his life by the skin of his teeth because of you. Head injuries, heart injuries, kids with broken limbs, a bloke who won't see his spleen again. Even your mate needs a metal plate in his head. So I reckon a brain haemorrhage is the least you deserve, 'Buzz'. Luke will need more surgery. Mr Gillespie is now working on his bowel and stopping the bleeding as he finds it. And then Mr Monroe, the neurosurgeon, will work on Luke's head injuries. My poor lad. What's he going through? Well, he's in the best hands. And he's a young man. He stands a very good chance. But your husband is my priority now. If I could take Luke's place I would, you know. Bet you've heard that a few times. But it's true. I would take his place right now. I know. Steven Dawlish. Luke's Dad. Fractures, blood in chest and haemo-pneumothorax. They inserted chest drains in A&E; but he's still bleeding. So we're looking at a lateral thoracotomy? Yes. Yeah. He's being anaesthetised now. I know why you wrote your letter of resignation by the way. And before we indulge in a little conversational dance, let me just repeat myself, I know why you resigned. I know all about you and Lawrence. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. Good. Let's make that the last word on the subject, shall we? I don't want to hear any more about the resignation. After what's happened we can't work together. Yes, we can work together. The work is the only thing that we do together that actually matters. Everything else is... hysteria. But... You are on your way to becoming an exceptional surgeon under my guidance. Why should your stupidity and moral vacuity deprive the world of a talented surgeon? It would be a waste. And I can't abide waste. All yours, Mullery. Monroe, you're up. He's now survived a heart and abdomen op. Make it a hat trick. Sorry it took so long. Don't worry. I've been busy picking skull fragments out of a motorcyclist's dura. He didn't need me to but it helped pass the time. Wilson? Luke Dawlish. Left-sided, frontal parietal acute subdural hematoma. Craniotomy for evacuation of the hematoma and reconstruction of cranium. Humpty Dumpty never had it so good. Chances of brain damage? We won't know till we're in there. Correct. We won't. Tough night, hey? What have you done? Tamponade. Between hematomas. It's the best, though, isn't it? Adrenalin time. Yeah. Are you OK? Not really. No. Anything you want to tell me? No. Right. So there is something but nothing you want to tell me. You're quick on the uptake tonight, aren't you? It's like a war zone. It affects women differently. She didn't just bin you, did she? No, certainly not. Is that the lorry driver? I would think so. 24 stone of British beef. Big Geoff. So you got a name? From his tattoo. But his girlfriend's on her way. Big Julie. OK. Well, it's pretty fuzzy but my guess is that fluid in the abdomen is blood. We're going to need to cut through a fair bit of fat. We're going to need some big retractors and some very strong assistants to hold up the abdominal wall. Everybody's working at full tilt. Then you're going to have to hold up about two stone of abdominal wall single-handed. Phwoar. Jacob. Thought about general surgery much? Not really. You look like you work out. Do you work out? Yeah, yeah. I can bench press 100 kilos. Top man. Come this way. One of the great skull rebuilds, Miss Wilson. I did a lot of jigsaws as a child. I can see you now. Church choir. Study. No telly. For a special treat, a Take That jigsaw on a little tray on your lap on a Saturday night. Am I close? I had my wild moments. What? Forcing the bit with Gary's head onto Robbie's body when no-one was looking? You may mock but my caution saved that man's life earlier this evening. You should have gone for the registrar post. Don't you think I know that now? I'm sorry, mate, she came to me and... No. No, I'm sorry. I should never have put you in that position. Have we done emotion now? God, I hope so. You're not Julie by any chance? Big Geoff's girlfriend. Big Julie. Yeah. I am. How did you know that? Come with me. I'll check but I think Geoff's just gone into theatre. I thought he might die. When we were waiting in that car. I prayed to God. I said, 'If you're going to take one of them, take Steve. Take my husband, not my son.' Why wouldn't you pray for that? I'd do the same. But you don't know Steve. No, no. I mean... I'd pray for my son. Oh, right. Of course. I'm all over the place. I just... I just... I... Just go home and get some rest. You won't miss anything for the next few hours. I see no reason to think he won't make a full recovery. I got both my lads back. Hey? That's the main thing, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. Tough job... putting him to sleep. It's about to get tougher. I sense a ruthlessness emerging in you, Mullery, that is both exhilarating and terrifying. I'm losing my soul. It's a job requirement. 'All changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty is born.' Not familiar with the poetry of Yeats? No. But I did used to drink in his wine lodge. Where'd you borrow the giant retractors from? Gynaecology. Don't even ask. I didn't know you had company. He comes on my rounds with me to raise morale. He's like Patch Adams. Who? I'm sorry you got dragged into our problems. It wasn't you that dragged me into it. I sat up here once with Lawrence and I explained to him why I was a bad bet. He didn't listen. The odds were stacked against you. It usually only takes one medic to wreck a relationship. You had two. After I'd told him I knew, he said something to me and... I'm gonna stop you right there and tell you whatever he said in the heat of the moment and whatever you said in the heat of the moment, none of that is worth taking seriously. He said I was unlovable. Maybe I am. Maybe I have a lack in me. I'm going to tell you something. I'm sorry. Do you mind that? The best thing that's happened to me all day. Sorry, you were going to say something. I've lost my thread. Completely lost my thread. Given the day that you've had, I don't suppose you're in the mood to come to a wedding in the morning? Tempting as it sounds, I think I'll decline. I'd give you a hug but - No, me neither. Boys! If you keep letting it drop, I can't get to the operating field. How long is it going to take? I haven't even checked the spleen yet. We need to take a rest and stretch. OK. Just for a moment, yeah? I hear you were hiring muscle. Wow! How many are under there? His pulse is up. He must have lost weight by now. He can't have eaten for four hours. His chest sounds bloody awful. I'll try and get more oxygen in. What's the problem, Larry? He aspirated when I intubated him. Could be pneumonitis. I'm struggling to get any air into him. Come on! He's arrested. Alistair, chest compressions. I need the pads on. Now. Come on! Shocking. Stand back. Stand back. Nothing. Try again. Stand back. Anything? No pulse. Pupils aren't reacting. No output. Nothing. He was a joke, you know. Big Geoff. And we were all laughing at him and everyone was saying what a pain he was because he's so overweight... and then he's dead. And it's brutal. That's what surgery's like. Every day. Everything's good, then the next minute everything's bad. And the joking, and the moaning? That's what we do to convince ourselves that we don't care. Why would you do that? Because you start caring too much, you can't do your job any more. You make it sound terrifying. It should be terrifying. Always. It's assault with a deadly weapon. Now, go home, get some sleep and I'll see you next year for your surgical rotation. I don't know if I'm going to be coming back. I do. Has Bremner ever said anything she doesn't mean? Well, no, but - Then she wants you to stay on. It'd always be there, wouldn't it? Plenty of good reasons to stay. So that's what's going on? All the moods. The cancelled dates. You and her. Shall we take this outside? OK, calm down and put your duelling pistols away. Me and Mullery? Is that what you actually believe? It's not that funny. Sorry. Can somebody please tell me what's going on? You should tell him. So, have you thought any more about whether you favour me staying on as Head of Clinical Services? If I give you my support, will you support me in making Wilson a registrar? That sounds perilously close to blackmail. Oh, it's blackmail. I just want to know if you're going to make the drop. Alistair. Have you got a minute? Yeah. A favour in exchange for your support for me. Oh, you've got my support. But it's not a favour I'm looking for. I need a reference. You and Shepherd? Is this true? No. I made it up because I thought it'd be a great way of letting you down gently. But it was before me. So why is it relevant to us now? You don't hate me for it? Why would I hate you for it? Because you might think that I only went out with you in the first place because I was on the rebound. I've never understood why that's such a bad thing. It gave me the chance I needed. If anything, I should thank Shepherd for rendering you emotionally vulnerable enough to respond to my advances. Right. Sweet. Come on. Jenny. I love you and I'm sorry for everything but I promise you... I love you. That makes your betrayal of me all the more hurtful. I'd really rather you felt nothing at all for me. And that's it? That's all you've got to say? Do you really think I'm going to give you the satisfaction of showing you my feelings? Oh, what a mess. I'm sorry. Yes. Me, too. Do you know, I thought I was better than this. Yes. Me, too. I'll call you. You all right, love? Yes, erm... It's just been a very long night. Jenny? Jenny? She didn't say anything at all? Not a word. Good night? Yep. In two entirely unrelated incidents I killed a fat man... and Jenny left me. Harsh. I can't live without seeing Louis. Oh, Larry. God... I wish you'd come and seen me before. I do come and see you. Before. Before any of this happened. I could have told you it wasn't worth it. Would you? And more to the point, I would also have told you that since I was single and Witney's judgment is clearly very poor, she might have extended that poor judgment and slept with me instead. I cannot believe you just said that. There are certain things you just have to say. Da-dah! Ooh... Oh, magnificent. Beyond magnificent. A glow-in-the-dark limbic system. The seat of the emotions. Perfect. I hope they appreciate it. Are you kidding me? What newlywed couple wouldn't appreciate the gift of a scan that says 'I love you.' I'll see you. You will indeed. It'll be OK, Larry. Really it will. Larry? Yeah? You won't leave without settling up on your tab, will you? Where is he? He's asleep. We were talking all night. It's not going to happen. Oh... OK. OK. Red or blue? Hi, Dad. You're going to have to get a move on! 10 minutes, I'll look like George Clooney. Very funny. Well, I thought so. So what did you say? Well, he was worried that it didn't feel perfect. And I said it never feels perfect. And that was it? That was your magic spell? And I said for all that we got wrong, if I had my chance again I'd marry you tomorrow. Is that true? Not really. But I didn't want to lose my deposit on the function room. Would you like it to be true? I don't ever regret marrying you, Gabriel. Even now, the good outweighs the shit.
