 Monroe (2011â€“2012): Season 2, Episode 5 - Episode #2.5 - full transcript 
 Monroe is amused when Springer gets a lawyer's letter following his inability to distinguish between a tumour and an abcess. Monroe himself is preparing to operate on straight-talking Bridget Addy to cure her epilepsy. She is unhappy when he tells her that she will only have a local anaesthetic as he removes part of her brain so he can check her speech so Lizzie persuades Neil,Bridget's ex-husband,to be give - reluctant - support,though he does not stay around after the operation. Jenny deals with teen-aged Grace Bushnall,who has been promised a heart transplant for some years and is now reluctant to have the operation though Jenny persuades her and again Sarah proves her worth. Gillespie also finds Mullery ever more impressive as they operate together on a man in need of an aortal graft. Lawrence decides to go back to Jenny whilst Monroe decides that he and Lizzie are never destined to be more than friends after he has sex with Anna.

 Some things are never going to work. It worked fine, didn't it? I'm really sorry. I slept with Shepherd. One minute I was asking her to marry me and the next I was at the door with a suitcase in my hand. I'm missing part of the story here. I slept with someone else. I slept with Witney. I even feel sorry for Springer. Any mistake in this job can rob the patient of their previous life. Any mistake you make in this job can result in catastrophe. Every mistake apart from one. Ah. Would you mind being more specific? It isn't a tumour? Well, praise the Lord. It isn't.

 It's an abscess. So what do we do now? Take a second to enjoy this moment because the good mistakes don't come along very often. So I haven't got a tumour? You never had a tumour. I never had one? No. You had an abscess. And? That's what we saw on the scan and thought was a tumour. You mean like those nut jobs who see a satellite and think it's a UFO? It's good to have a sense of humour about these things. Yeah? Maybe you've taken my sense of humour out along with the abscess. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Go back to her and sort it out. You know. Lie if you have to. To her. To yourself. And that's it? That's the sum total of your advice? What can I say? I'm not the Dalai Lama. Yeah, I'd noticed.

 I'm trying. All right? Living with me? You call that trying? She didn't exactly beg me to stay. You had a one-night stand! Live with it and stop blaming how bad you feel on her. It's not fair. She loves you. Put it right. Starting now. Go on. Um... Are we still going to Relate tomorrow? Do you still want to go? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I do. I... I want to sort this out and I think that's probably the only way of doing it. Good. So do I. I hope that's your alibi you're working on, Springer! "Mental torture"? He must have a very imaginative lawyer. He said you led him to believe he had a brain tumour. It wasn't as though he didn't need a brain operation. That does rather resemble a garage mechanic's alibi. Wilson, anything to add? An MRI DWI sequence would have helped to spot the difference. Thank you. Did you check that, Springer? It was entirely my fault. A misdiagnosis. And it happens sometimes. But I hold up my hands to it. What can I say? "Sorry." In writing. And quickly. I think his lawyer is all sizzle and no steak. They used to say that on Murder One. I've waited years to use it. I admit, Springer, I was impressed with your honesty. Ah, nothing can touch me. I wake up every morning with a smile on my face. It's the expression on Witney's face you need to worry about. It's usually a look of deep and lasting gratitude. Wilson, give me one good reason not to run out of this hospital screaming right now. Bridget Addy, 45. Suffers from epilepsy long term but the fits are suddenly getting difficult to control. Various anti-epilepsy drugs have been tried and failed. She was finally referred to neurology two months ago. They did an EEG, a CT scan and an MRI. They conducted an angiogram, and she's due a Wada Test. Are there any more tests they can do on this poor woman? Can we make some up? No. She's pretty much tested out. What you have is known as cortical dysplasia. It just means that the neurons are all knotted up and not working properly. Right. We will remove them and it will help seizure control. It may even stop them altogether. I'll be working near a part of the brain called Broca's area. The speech centre. So when we are doing the actual operation, you will be awake and we will be able to check on your speech. Awake? How do you mean? We'll put you to sleep to remove your skull and then wake you up again when we do the actual operation. How does she mean? Awake? Well... it's a bit weird but you get used to it. And in my experience, it's nice to be the centre of attention. Let me tell you something, love. When you've come round outside the supermarket, lying in your own pee, with people thinking you're drunk, that "centre of attention" thing is not really all it's cracked up to be. Fair enough. I'll see you on the ward later. We will leave you with Lizzie. Friends, family, arrogant surgeons - she can handle anyone. Is your husband gonna come and see you? Ex-husband. Split up six months ago. No prizes for guessing why. Couldn't handle your epilepsy? Well, my cooking wasn't brilliant either but... It's a tough thing to go through on your own. You got anybody else? No, not really. Shall I tell your ex to come in and see you? I don't suppose Gary Barlow's available, is he? Your second date with Lizzie. I've nailed it. Stop giving him false hope. A fondue evening. Yeah, that could work. It says casual. It says fun. It says sharing. It says cheese. If I hoped to date Wallace and Gromit, cheese would be the answer. Never underestimate the allure of fondue. How long's she been on the waiting list? Ah... four years. But the last six months she has deteriorated and she's on the active list so... The transplant coordinator is happy if we are. Where's the heart from? Manchester. Be a blow for multiculturalism - Lancastrian heart in a Yorkshire lass. Mullery, anything to add? Not really. Have we got a bed? No. But the old chap in No.4 is looking distinctly peaky. Could we just find a bed without resorting to euthanasia? OK, keep me posted on the ETA for the heart. Thank you, everybody. Good luck. You are going to have to be more assertive. Give your opinion. I thought being good at my job was enough. Are you OK? I've got A & Es stacking up. So, Grace. I think we can allow ourselves to get a little bit excited. The heart's on its way and everything looks set for the transplant. Can't believe it, Jenny. After all this time! So we need to get you ready as soon as possible. It's not gonna be like last time? I don't want her to go through that again. I will be checking the heart myself and we'll prep you but we won't anaesthetise you or move you onto theatre until we're absolutely sure the operation will go ahead. You know what people say to her? Must be great to lay around doing nothing. If you want me to act out every episode of One Tree Hill, I'm happy to do so. Well, maybe later. Uh... Now you're 18 you get to sign your own consent form. There you are. There she is. Sorry, love. You've got the wrong feller. That woman is not your ex-wife? She's my ex-wife all right. That's why I'm the wrong feller. She won't want to see me and I don't want to see her. She hasn't got anybody else. That's not my fault. Not any more. How long were you married for? 20 years. Years one and eight were not unhappy. And, on reflection, year 12 had its moments. For 20 years, she washed your underpants. Tomorrow somebody's gonna take a chisel to her skull. Least you can do is be there to hold her hand. I think you may have got the wrong impression about Monroe, you know. What impression's that, then? You know. Loud mouth. The "big I am". Joker in the pack. Ego merchant. Problem gambler. Emotionally crippled. Shagabout. Charming... until he's launched you. Wandering eyebrows. That's just the surface stuff. And what's your point? I'm just saying... it's not what he's really like, deep down... apart from the eyebrows. Right. Well, thanks for the reference. I'll be in touch. Hidden depths. This is best place for goodbyes. See you soon. I love you. Told you I'd be here. You OK? Can I change my mind? We've had a good look at the heart and it's all good. Got no last-minute hitches, then? No last-minute hitches. That's a shame. I don't think I want this. Any of it. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't. Is this normal? Yes. Grace has been waiting a long time and now that it's finally happening she's coming to terms with the fact that she's about to have major surgery. Maybe we should talk to her. No, no, no. I think I'll be able to reassure her. How long has she got to make her mind up? Oh, a little while yet. I wouldn't worry. It'll be fine. How long have we got? Half an hour at the outside. Cup of tea. Yep. No problem. Oh, Bradley tells me you've got hidden depths. Oh, God. He didn't get more specific than that? No. Don't worry. Although I'm suspecting uh... stamp collecting and brass rubbings. Just for the record. He didn't mention fondue? No. Definitely not. I would have remembered that. It's like... It's like something in the back of my mind, rattling away. Like a window you've left open when you've gone to bed. Does that make any sense? I know that this is hard for you to get used to, but it really is the best chance you're gonna get. How old was he? The donor. The boy who died? 16. What must his mum and dad be going through? Hell. Real hell. But they still agreed to have his organs harvested. I'm so scared. Shall I let you into a little secret? A heart transplant... It isn't actually that difficult. Right. So are you saying this is gonna be easy? You've been through much tougher operations. The second time we fixed that leaky valve, that was... That was challenging. No, this is... Well, this is just stitching, really. And stitching is very much up there on my list of... superpowers. In an ideal world, how long have I got... to make my mind up? In an ideal world? I'd have started operating about 20 minutes ago. Hello, Emily. How are you doing? So how you been keeping? Good, yeah. You? Had a bit of a toothache a while back, like, but it cleared up all by itself. Hospital visitor standards are really slipping. I wouldn't want my real husband here if I was going through this, let alone my ex. Do you think Anna would want you by her bedside? Of course she would. Her boyfriend's a vet. I'm not sure what use he'd be. Unless she had distemper. Huh. Do you want anything bringing in? Wouldn't mind a Puzzler magazine. And some fruit. Yeah, OK. No problem. Consider it done. I'll get the money off you when I work out how much it all comes to, shall I? That's good of you. This gentleman needs to see me now. Oh, right, yeah. Don't want to be in the way. I just need to double check. Do you mind? You've had anaesthetic before? Yes. If that's your Clint Eastwood stare, you need to work on it, love. Just a word before we begin. What? Don't worry. You've not done anything wrong. But you should know that this is a counter-intuitive operation. Cutting out a heart. It's well within your skill range... but it goes against every instinct you've nurtured as a heart surgeon. You might find it a bit unsettling. So, how will you proceed? Midline sternotomy. Open up the pericardium. Give the heparin. Usual arterial cannulation, bicaval venous cannulae. Go on bypass. Cross-clamp the aorta. Start explanting the heart. Then we place the new heart into the thoracic cavity and start suturing for our lives. For her life. We start suturing for her life. Yes. Yes, exactly so. Stupid machine! You all right, mate? I'm trying to get change for the parking meter. Ah, there's a knack. Thanks for coming to see Bridget, by the way. It must be awkward. You don't know the half of it. My girlfriend thinks I'm out doing the big shop. Well, at least you got the crisps. It's just um... I walked. You know. It's hard seeing her like this without feeling like a bit of a bastard. Why do you feel like that? Are you a bit of a bastard? No, no, it's just cos I left her, you know, and she's er... you know, she's doing the old er... mystery dance. You're right. You should have stayed with her out of pity. Women love that. All right. Good. I think we're ready to take it out. You do the honours, Miss Witney. I told you it would feel wrong. It's such an empty space. It's like... I don't want to know what it's like. I want you to deal with it and get on with the job. Good. Right, we'll start with the 4-0 Prolene, please. Thank you. Jill, Call Monroe. OK. Let's remove the aortic clamp and see what we've got. Nothing yet. It can sometimes take a few minutes before it starts to beat. How long has it been going on? Just over a minute. Still nothing. How long has that had no rhythm? Four minutes. OK. Let's er... wind up the infusion rate on the Dobutamine and give a bolus dose of adrenaline. Looks like she's gonna need a bit of help. Come on. Come on. Good. OK. We're getting a rhythm. That's good. OK. Let's check for bleeding. And no more whooping, thank you. I find it affected and distracting. Should we postpone her operation? Postpone it? I'd do it right now if I could. Why don't we wait till her fits settle down? If she has a fit during surgery... We operate when fits become frequent and destructive. What you've seen. Would you describe it as destructive? Yes, but... And we know that they're frequent. If she has a fit during surgery, we'll handle it. After all, I do have the most overqualified trainee on the planet. That was good work, Miss Witney. Thank you. I thought we weren't going to have a happy ending for a few minutes. Risks of pneumonia, eternal wound infection, renal failure, acute rejection and urinary infection in the first 30 days. I know. I was just saying. The happy ending is when Grace dies in her bed aged 90. So the only happy ending any of us can look forward to is a peaceful death? So far, in my experience. Yes, that's about right. Why? Do you have a better version? Grace? Grace. How are you feeling? Tired. She's... She's still feeling a bit groggy but that's to be expected. But she's doing very well. We'll try and get her back on the ward as soon as we can but obviously after an operation like this we've got to keep her clear of infection. But it's all looking very good. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Sorry. No, don't be silly. She's your child... and you're entitled. Miss Witney, a word. What you did in the operating theatre today... that's what's important. Right? Right. And you are very, very good at it, and you clearly love it. So... without putting too fine a point on it, don't let anything get in your way. He has to be the love of your life. What? If he is not the love of your life, then end it now. Because having a relationship at work is... Well, let's just say... that unless Springer is the love of your life, he just isn't worth the pain. Me and Springer, it's just - Ah, you see, it can't be "just"... And what started out as "just" becomes... What started as flirting in a corridor... ends in a draughty room, talking to a stranger about your feelings when we really don't know what our feelings even are. I'm just trying to save you from an unholy mess. I don't really... I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Well, there's no need to look quite so panic-stricken. I know I broke my own rules and got personal but I just thought in this instance... I won't let it distract me from being a good surgeon. Good. Good. I'm sure you won't. I have paper. I have coloured pens. I have stickers. Do you have alcohol? Try and be a bit more enthusiastic. Doing the seating plan might be the most enjoyable bit about the wedding. I'm not sitting next to Uncle Billy. He still does that death grip thing on my knee and finds sweets behind my ear. Oh, put him next to me. I find the combination of death grip and mint imperials strangely alluring. Now you tell me. No, I am very kindly putting you next to Dave. Dave won't be coming to the wedding. Really? He seemed so keen. Dave and I... Dave wasn't over his previous girlfriend. Oh. Right. I'm sorry. And I find myself believing that I really am sorry. I am. I think we both realised that we wanted to have a relationship again but not necessarily with each other. Ah... a sort of transition thing. Yeah. But more than that. You know, for me it was a relief to know I could enjoy having sex again. Ah... Hm. I'm glad you said, "again". I worry that Louis is the reason that Lawrence wants to come back. And I suppose I want to hear him say that he wants to come back for me. Lawrence, do you feel able to talk about your reasons for wanting to go back? I would have thought it was obvious. Not to Jenny. Not to me. If you feel you are going back for your son, what do you think that says about your relationship? What do you think Jenny might take from that? How do you feel about that? Do you feel you can manage to talk about that? I'm sorry. Sorry. Lawrence? Lawrence? Sorry. Sorry. No, it's all right. It's all right. It's not all right. It's not all right. It's not all right. What is it? I don't know. I don't know. This. But I'm sorry. Surprise. I've got a cheeky little Beaujolais. It's young but highly quaff able, as I might say if I was trying to annoy Monroe. Or you. I've annoyed you, haven't I? No. No, it's not you. It's just... If you don't mind... I just need an early night. On my own. Oh. Right. Sure. I should have called. Or texted. Or something. I'm sorry. Night. Yes. Night. Well, this isn't how I imagined any of this would happen. Me neither. Have you seen their present list? It's so sensible. Why can't they ask for a brass bed, some throws and a bong? Because they're not living in an Austin Powers movie. Hello. Yeah. I'll be right out. Well, that's me. Good night. Good night. Mm. Ahh... Oh. If this goes where I think it might go, you know... in the morning, we may well hate ourselves. Well... Gabriel, I'm seriously impressed. Looks like you've finally grown up. Yeah. It was bound to happen sometime. Gabriel. Mm-hm? Do you mind if I go over this side? I do, actually. Um... I always sleep on this side. Really? Mm-hm. You haven't slept on that side in 20 years. Why have you changed sides? I haven't. It's just that this flat is south facing so that side feels different. What was that? It's Shepherd. He's staying with me for a few days. Why are we whispering? Because it feels like we're doing something wrong. Are you OK, Larry? He's in a relationship and getting none. You're divorced and sleeping with your ex-wife. No wonder there's a recession. It was a one-off. All right? Could you not rekindle the magic between the sheets? It was a very pleasant trip down memory lane for both of us. Both of you? Mullery. In a world of unlikely couplings, you remain reliably single. What the fuck's that supposed to mean? I think it was supposed to be a compliment. Oh, it's funny, is it? What about this? Is this funny? To be fair to Mullery... that was quite funny. Now, awake surgery is not the most pleasant experience for the patient, so when she comes round, I want to see comforting expressions. All right? That isn't you doing your comforting expression, is it, Springer? Ah, great. My team looks more reassuring by the minute. He's having a cigarette outside at his retirement party. Starts getting terrible back pains. Mullery picked him up at A & E, felt the pulsation in his abdomen and sorted out an urgent CT scan. Good call, Mullery. Could you go and talk to his wife? And then go straight down. I'm thinking of letting Mullery do the abdominal end. Do you think he'll be up to it? I think Mullery would be up to repairing the Bayeux Tapestry if he put his mind to it. It's his mind I'm worried about, not his hands. Mullery? He's always been very calm. Not any more. He seems to be falling out with everybody at the moment. He even had a pop at Shepherd this morning. Can you tell me what that is, Bridget? A watch. Good. And this? A duck. Yep. And what's this? Ahh... It's OK. There's no need to worry. Catch that? Yeah, I won't go near there. She's fitting. Iced saline! Explanation? Jacksonian. Provoked by you working on her motor strip. More saline, come on! You can talk and spray at the same time, can't you? We're gonna operate straightaway and repair the damage. Now Ron's in the best place. Do you think it was the cake? He said it was too rich but I said I like cream. It won't have been the cake. Far more likely the sly fag he was having. Sly fag? What sly fag? He gave up ten years ago when he had his stroke. Oh. You might want to talk to him about that. Oh, Mrs Daggert. Mrs Daggert? Let me show you where you can get a cup of tea. I think it was the cake. Take the aortic cannula. Good, now erm... hold the cannula with the bevel pointing towards the arch. You hadn't anything planned today, had you? No more fights lined up? We'll have to suture each branch artery individually and then re-implant the major arteries supplying the bowel and kidneys. Should I cancel this afternoon's elective? Cancel the milk and papers. We might be quite a while. OK, Bridget? I had a fit, didn't I? You did. Yes. That was... That was... Monroe? I heard. What are you trying to tell us, Bridget? That was the last one I'll ever have. I hope so, Bridget. I certainly hope so. That's Mr Daggert's. Is it true you hit Shepherd? Well, he deserved it. And the thing is... I really thought I knew you and then you do something like that and I feel like I don't even know you at all. I was lonely and... and under pressure. No excuse. Oh... I look back at it now and it makes no sense. And I'm sorry. But I really need you to carry on being my mate. Do you think I'd have hit Shepherd if I wasn't your mate? You're a good man Mullery, with a right hook to die for. Call me slugger. Did that slap of Mullery's bring you to your senses? I'd already come to my senses. I'm going back to her. If she'll have me. Good. Good. Strip the bed before you go. If she asks about your black eye, you got it playing Wii Just Dance. It happens. Oh, um... that thing between me and Anna last night, it was erm... It didn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things. I'd assumed that it might mean you're not gonna pursue Lizzie any more. Why would it mean that? Because you've cheated on Lizzie between date one and date two. Because you're a single man with a whole world of single women to choose from and you end up sleeping with your ex-wife. Because your pursuit of Lizzie was entirely driven by jealousy of Anna. And, last but not least, because Lizzie's no longer interested in you. For a man with a train wreck of a love life, you talk a very good game. What can I say? You don't have to be a good player to be a good manager. Bridget. Hello. Do you know where you are? Hospital. Good. Can you push against me? Good. Good. Very good. She's doing well. It'll take a few days, but I'm pleased with her. Has it worked, then? Is she cured? Be a while before we know that. We'll need to monitor her for the next few months. Right. Great. Thanks a lot. That's me done, then. I'll erm... shoot off if there's nothing else. Not quite the ending I was hoping for. You old romantic. Lizzie? This isn't about affairs of the heart, is it? Well, yes. I think we should just be friends and colleagues. I really like you but erm... Great. That is the best news all day. I'm sorry to let you down. You're not. You're agreeing with me. Good. Good. Not even a little bit sad? No. Who else have you told? What? Mullery punched me today. There can be only one reason why. You'd better come in. No, I don't want to come in. I want to know who else you told? Springer? Bremner? What are you trying to do to me? Nothing. Nothing at all. Then why? Because I had to tell somebody. Just like you did. I haven't told a soul. Apart from Monroe. I haven't... Don't deny it. So you know why I had to tell someone. I won't be telling anybody else, so don't worry on that score. Why don't you just go home to your family? That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Has he gone yet? I'm afraid he sidled off earlier. Thank goodness for that. He hadn't been here five minutes and I remembered why we'd split up. Give me your hands. I want you to push against me. I'd like to pretend it was the epilepsy that did it. You know, that left me on my own. I was just never very good at that stuff. No-one is. Not really. OK, squeeze. You know, when I was a little girl, my dad would take me to the pub, sit me on a barstool with a bag of crisps... and I'd watch all the grown-ups talking and laughing. And I thought one day I'll be able to do that, you know, just... Talking about nothing as though it's something? It's a knack. And alcohol helps. I'm still that little girl... sitting on a barstool... wondering when I get to join in. I heard that was some operation you pulled off today. I didn't come here for small talk - though I appreciate the effort. Right. I'm going to say something and... you don't have to say anything other than "Yes" or "No". I know that you're Lawrence's best friend and I wouldn't be putting you through this if I didn't think I was going mad... But I think, deep down, after what's happened to you in the past, I just think, deep down... you know that it's better if the truth comes out sooner rather than later. So... This is what I think. I think Lawrence is having, or has had... some sort of affair. And I think you know about it. I think you need to talk to Larry about this. Look me in the eye and tell me that I'm wrong. Can you do that? Can you deny it? I am in agony here, Monroe. I really... really wouldn't be doing this if I wasn't. Please. I can't deny it. And erm... as insane as it sounds, I just need to know. I think he may have had an affair... with Sarah Witney. Thank you. There's been an RTA on the M62. OK. The cavalry is here. He's arresting. Chest compressions, come on! There's a young lad hanging on to his life by the skin of his teeth because of you. Monroe, he's bleeding out. You can't pull rank. I'm the registrar. You're throwing everything away. What do you think I've been lying to you about? About sleeping with Witney. You've screwed everything! Everything apart from Witney. Who you screwed in case it slipped your mind!
