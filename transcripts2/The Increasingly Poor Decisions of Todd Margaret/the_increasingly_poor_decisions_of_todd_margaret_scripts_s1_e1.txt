Just with all my information. You see that? That's why we're the best. Best in the world. I'm coming out. Hello, everyone. I'm Todd Margaret. Sorry. I was looking for dynamic integrated business solutions. This is dynamic integrated business solutions. What happened to everybody? Are you it? I was sent down here by the head office... A guy named Willis? - Brent Wilts? - Bang... that's it. Okay. Yeah-yeah. Hello. I'm the new boss. Name's Todd Margaret. What's your name? Dave. What happened to your hand? - Strawberry jam. - Right. - Okay, Dave. - Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess I'll get settled into - my office. - Sure. It's just that one down there. - I'll let you get back to what you were doin'. - Brilliant. Okay. Wha... - Dave! - Yes? I'm gonna leave the door open, if you need me. Got it. - Todd Margaret! - Yes, what? There's a delivery of "Thunder Muscle" here for ya. Good. - So, what is "Thunder Muscle," anyway? - Well, Dave, I'll tell ya. "Thunder Muscle" is an awesome new energy drink. - You people go shithouse for 'em, huh? - Oh, not really. - What's in it? - Well, "Thunder Muscle" contains, well, I don't read Korean, but it's, you know, energy and probably guarana berries, - things of that nature, you know. - How are you planning to sell all this shit? No, Dave. How are we planning to sell all this shit? I don't wanna tip my hand, but I'm lookin' for a new director of strategy. I've been back there. I've had my eye on you, and I think you might be my man. - Don't really think I'm qualified. - But-but-but-but-da-ba... yeah. I didn't get to be top salesman by being a poor judge of character. - Tell me a little bit about yourself. - Okay. Well, name is Dave. Okay, good. Good... good start. You're forthcoming with your name. What else you got? - I'm a real go-getter. - Boom! That's what I'm lookin' for! I think I found my new director of strategy. - Cool. - Now, we have a lot of "Thunder Muscle" to sell, and I know where I would take me to sell it, but I'm curious. Where would my new D.O.S. take me? Oh, no-no-no-no. I asked for coffee. I'm jet-lagged. No. Barman said "No." Hey, boss, I've got a question. - How did you come to land this gig? - You know, I'm sittin' at the office, mindin' my own. Wilts come in. He wants the top salesman, right? Somebody to come over here. Somebody who knows the U.K., you know? And you know the U.K.? - Yeah... you know, what's to know really? - That's what you said to him? No-no-no. I told him... I told him I grew up in Leeds, 'cause I did grow up in Leeds, if anybody asks. Yes. You grew up in Leeds? I didn't grow up, per se. No... I should clarify that. My... My dad lives in Leeds. Lived in Leeds. He's dead. My dad lived in Leeds, and I would spend my summers with him. So, what would you get up to? - Excuse me? - What would you get up to in Leeds? - With your dad? - He, well, you know, every Saturday, you know, we'd grab some fish and chips, head to the park, watch "The Who," you know, - stuff like that. - Every Saturday, you'd watch "The Who?" - Yeah. - Right. - The band "The Who." - Yeah... no, I'm aware of them... yeah. "Live at Leeds"... that's why they named the album that. - Yeah. - Listen. This "Thunder Muscle" is not gonna sell itself, you know? - Yeah. - We're here to sell "Thunder Muscle." Oh, why don't you try him? A challenge, all right. Hey there, sport. How ya doin'? You look like a man who could use a little get up and go. - Piss off. - All right. You know, I've spent some time in Leeds. I had a girlfriend that used to go to uni up there. Great. Yeah. I bet... - I bet a lot's changed since I was there. - No... probably not. - Well, you never know. - Well, I do know. So, whereabouts in Leeds did you live? It was, you know, that main street. - No. - The main street, big street, - goes right through town. - What was it called? - Fifth Avenue. - Fifth? I don't believe there is a fifth Avenue. No-no-no. The street... No. The street's not named fifth Avenue, Dave. No, I meant the fifth Avenue counting outwards - from the main street. - Oh, yes. Okay. So that would be - Ch-church Avenue. - Church Avenue! - Yes, that was it. Church Avenue. - Church Avenue. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Lovely around there. - Yeah, it's nice. - Beautiful church right on it. - Yeah. So, what number did you live on in Church Avenue? - Twenty-one-fifty. - Two thousand, one hundred and fifty? - Church Avenue. - That's too long. We don't really have long avenues over here. Dave, I'm sorry. I said 21 and 50. It just, like, - ran it together 'cause I'm American. - So, you had two houses? - Yes. - On the same street? Yeah. My dad was bipolar, so... Hey, you know what? I think it's time to sell another can of "Thunder Muscle," huh? - Yeah. Well, I mean, it'd be a can. - Right. Hello-hello-hello-hello-hello. My name is Todd, - and today is your lucky day. - Now is not a good time. Hey, it's always a good time for a "Thunder Muscle." "Thunder Muscle" is a brand-new, exciting energy drink that gives you energy, vitality, and tastes great doin' it. - And will it bring back my son? - If anything can lure your son back, it's the great... Okay. No. I... he's not... away. He's gone gone. He's... dead? I know. I'm sorry. I just found out myself. Okay. I'll be over there. So, Todd, obviously having spent so much time in the U.K., I'm sure you can tell where I'm from, from my accent. - Yeah. - So, where am I from? Oh, you know, probably around... Hey, there's a "Thunder Muscle" couple, huh? If I ever see you again, I'll rip your balls off! - You all right, Todd? - You shouldn't have let me go over there, Dave. They clearly weren't a "Thunder Muscle" couple. It's your first verbal warning. I don't understand. They're the ones who started the name calling. That's not what really what was happening. You know, as part brit, you should know what we call our cigarettes here. Oh, look, first voice message. Hey, douche bag. It's Brent Wilts. Listen, shit bucket. I'm gonna be in Lisbon for a boat show, and I was thinkin' of poppin' over there to see how my ace salesman is doin'. I got 16,000 crates of that shit comin' to you by freighter from north Korea. And also, see if you can get me some blow, while I'm there. I wanna get stinky drunk and nuts deep in some of that nasty, British pussy. Actually, you know what? Fuck that. They got a bunch of Russian whores there, right? Yeah... let's do that instead. English women always give me the shits. He's... what? Sixteen thousand crates? - Sixteen thousand. - Oh, wait a minute. Come on... I just got here. I mean, come on. This is insane. I can't... what is... I... Come on. This isn't the Todd Margaret I know. Now, let's think about this. Here, get some "Thunder Muscle" down you. You're a bit pissed. Now, calm down. Up through the lips. There we go. There it is. Feel better? Now, where would a top dog, ace salesman like yourself take me to sell this stuff? - Hey, Alice. - What happened to you? Oh, it's nothin'. You should see the other guy. It was a lady. She's fine. Yeah, this is Dave. He works for me. - Hello. - Hi. Alice, I'm wondering. Can I make a short, general announcement about the drinks? Well, normally, I'd say, "no," but based on what happened earlier, yeah. Go on... what the hell? I can do with a laugh. Nice. Come on, Todd. Show me how it's done. All right. Rule number one: Make everyone feel at home. Hello-hello-hello, everyone. If I could have a wee minute of a brief spot tinkling of your time, please, I'd like to introduce you to a brand-new energy drink called "Thunder Muscle." It's delicious, good for you, a great new way to get up and go. I'll leave these here for your perusal. - Thank you, very much. - Wait, have another. - Can't have just one. - Absolutely... why not? - Oh, no, don't give him another one. - Who can stop at one? - Oh, that's good! - You love it, don't ya? - Abso... yeah. - Show 'em how much you love it. Oh, I love it so much. You're gonna love it, too. It's like mother's milk, isn't it? Just mmm-uah. Absolutely, Dave. Thank you, very much. Like the sweet milk of mother Mary herself. And I'm sure that when sweet baby Jesus was there, sucking on her teet... not... nursing is what I mean, but, I mean, let's be honest. Nursing is sucking. I mean, come on. It's not a bad word. It's not dirty. It's not dirty to suck a tit, you know? Right... here they are! Take a look at your leisure. It'll be your pleasure and my measure. - Come on, show 'em the energy. - No, don't show us the energy. You can't go now. You've gotta show 'em the energy, Todd. Go on... show it to 'em. Get your "Thunder Muscle" out. Absolutely! I am filled with energy. - That's the great thing about "Thunder Muscle!" - No, don't run... don't! - I'm runnin', I'm runnin'! I'm runnin' around! - Careful... Todd, don't. - Look at this! - Please, don't run because... - Yes... come on, Todd. - I'll sing it, I'll dance it. - I'm comin' to town. I've got energy! - That's it... He's got energy. Look at him go! I have the strength of 20 ponies. - Twenty! - I have the strength of Zeus, after he made love to a bionic hippopotamus. - Yeah, nailed it. - Can you see what I'm saying? I'm like "Rocky" and "Rocky three" combined. I'm like if "Rocky two" fucked "Rocky four," boom, "Rocky five." Do you see what I'm sayin'? Give me another one of these things. - Yes! Get it down you, Todd. - Don't drink another one. Chug, chug, chug! Chug, chug, chug, chug... yes! - Oh, my God! - Stop encouraging him, please. Here's another thing about "Thunder Muscle." - It'll make you hard. I mean, brrrr. - Don't be scared... - Okay... no, don't. - Seriously, I mean, feel this. - She doesn't wanna feel it. - Feel it, feel it! Don't be scared. When was the last time you had any? That's what I'm saying. - I will fuck the old out of you, right now. - No, no. All night long, I will. - That's the beauty of "Thunder Muscle!" - Not acceptable! It's just one of the many things! Here,"Thunder Muscle" No, where are you going? I am talking to you. - Go on, tell 'em about "Thunder Muscle." - Why... because Barack Obama is president? You racist! You racist! I'm talking to you! I'm trying to make a presentation! Look, just... My point is, please, just get a "Thunder Muscle." Just buy one. It's one pound. That's all it is, one pound. Just somebody fucking buy one, please. - I better get me another one of these things. - You don't need another "Thunder Muscle." - No... I want one! - You really don't need one. Jesus. - What's the matter with you? - Oh, it's funny. I wanna go home. I'd like to buy a can of "Thunder Muscle," please. You're a nice lady. - How much do I owe you? - The lady paid for it, mate. She did? That was nice. This sucks.
