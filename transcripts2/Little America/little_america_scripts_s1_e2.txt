 Pepita... I told you to fold the clothes. I am folding the clothes. No, you're balling it up. Can you imagine being this rich and deciding to put that in your home? I don't know... Maybe I should become an artist. She's going to hear you. What? She can't understand us. Bring the laundry.

 My mom loves your art. Tell her thank you. Gracias. Gracias, Gloria. Hey, chato. Get up. I got to put the vacuum back here. Come on. I worked, like, 15 hours today. Here. Pretend it's your girlfriend. Yo, give us some privacy. - Bye, mijo. - Bye, Ma. Fool, I don't care if it's from Goodwill. You need to wipe this thing and get some new songs. I don't know. Gary's shit's starting to grow on me. Hey, Diego. Pick me, pick me.

 Three dollars, I do your drywall. I don't even do drywall. Hey. You wanna play you-don't-want-that? Here, I'll go first. - You don't want that. - Rosado! I saw that. All right. Behavior log. That's your mom's signature? That looks a lot like your handwriting. Yeah, 'cause we're related. I don't know how long we're gonna play this game or what it's gonna take to make you care about your future. Oh, my God. This talk again? Yeah. There are colleges that... Don't laugh. There are scholarships you can apply for. What? Are you gonna lend me your Social Security number? You have to get this signed by your mom or I'll have to suspend you. This water thing is nice. Hey, can I help you? Hey. Yeah. We're here for the squash thing. Okay, cool. Oh, my God. It smells like money in here. Focus. Free shoes, remember? Girls, please. Right now you are meant to be bouncing your balls. You hear that, Marisol? Bounce those balls. You're the queen of balls. I have heard these all before. Your jokes are not fresh. - You, come with me. - Why? The runt is always first to go. Okay. Everybody out, on the other side of the glass. Let's go. And close the door behind you. Thank you. Squash is simple. Just hit the ball. I am not looking for skills because you don't have any. Especially you. I am looking for instincts. Ready? Here we go. In the beginning, you will lose more than you win, so it's okay if you cry. - I don't cry. - No? Again. And again. Next. One more. Damn. Good. Very good. - Really? - No, you were bad. But inside of you, there is a jaguar. Okay. In the words of the great basketball player, Kevin Garnett, aka KG, "You cannot teach the beast." It is either in you or it is not. "You cannot go to the store and buy a six-pack of beast." Next. I'm feeling food. - That's fine? - Okay. Let's do pizza? - Yes, the mall. Right now. - Okay. Hey, hey. Those don't go home with you. - What? - The shoes. You do not get to take them with you. Seriously? You must come back to have them. That's messed up. I got a cousin in law school. You're lucky we don't sue. Let's bounce, Marisol. They don't want us here. Tuesday, 3:00 p.m. I will see you? How many times must I tell you? My garage, my rules. So, you must keep your belongings in your own refrigerator. Not everything fits in ours. That's not my problem. This refrigerator is "Off-limits. Sanjay." My ham. My property. There you are! It's so late! Ask him about the sink. Hey. When are you gonna get someone to fix the sink? I told you, I'm waiting to hear back from my cousin. It's been two months. That sound is making me crazy. So? Call the police. I'm gonna shit on that guy's ham. Yummy. You know what? A woman from your school called me. She says you have something to show me. A list of your behavior? No big deal. Yes, yes, okay, but show me. Quick. I don't understand this. Mijo. Come here. Nothing special, you know... Just that she's doing pretty good. Cut the shit. Okay. Monday, Marisol stood up in the middle of class... and yelled: "History is bullshit." Tuesday, Marisol was late to class... and threw a pencil in the ceiling as the teacher was lecturing. But then Wednesday... Huh, no. Wednesday, Marisol threw the teacher's grade book in the trash. Ma. Ma, it's not a big deal. "It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal." That's what you say about everything. Your brother quit school to get a job, so that you could keep going. If it's "No big deal," then maybe you should stop going to school. The jaguar returns. Where's your friend? She quit. Thought you were a dick. That is correct. Why'd you come back? I dunno. You said I had to come back for the shoes. I was lying. You can keep the shoes and go. But I think you like squash. - No, I don't. - Now you are lying. Not everyone dives for the ball like a crazy person. Dominguez y Rosado. Play. Everyone else, out. Let's go. Play. Stop. Rosado, what are you doing? You are swinging like a crazy person. Hitting hard will not make you win. I don't know how to play, man. Just tell me what to do. Make a decision, "man." Just one. Focus on what is in front of you. Winning is a series of good decisions. If I make a bad one? The ball always comes back. And when it does, just make a different decision. You serve. How was that? Like a jaguar. Shut up, fool! No matter where you play, you must know everything about the court. Every angle, every wall. Every one of these marks is a different decision. If you listen, you can hear their stories. I am thinking you are ready for a tournament yourself. I don't think so. Too late. I signed you up. I paid the $25 entry fee, so now you must. Come on. We've been training for eight months. Well, I wouldn't wanna waste those $25. We will start you on local tournaments, then national, and then play international games. Fly all over the world. - I can't. - You can. You're a jaguar. Can you just stop saying that? You're gonna be captain. Team USA. - You're dreaming. - We are campaigning the Olympic Committee. - I don't have a passport. - So then get one. I can't. Okay. Let's focus on this tournament right here. You know that girl who is always practicing next door? Scandinavian with the bones in the cheeks. What is that? - Cheekbones? - Yes. Have you heard her talk? She sound like a cartoon pony. Yeah. What about her? Her name is Charlotte Ansley. She's the top junior player of squash in the state. Yeah. She is really good. Yes. And I can teach you how to destroy her. Would you like that? Excellent. Now you are ready for your first tournament. He is Cuban. And very nice. He's a total gentleman. Is he fine? Don't be so nosy. You know what? There's no way I'm having any more babies. Especially, not after you. Check these out. Mr. Gilbert's sweatpants. They're new. They'd be good for squash, right? I can't wear those! That's not how people dress there. But aren't you running around, all sweaty? Yes, Mama, but you don't understand. It's complicated. I don't want to show up in Mrs. Gilbert's trash. Very well. Ma. It's okay. Rosado, ten. Wynberg, eight. Match point, Rosado. - Good game. - Thank you very much. Your spacing was undisciplined. Were you trying to hit the ball or hug it? Because I could not tell. Tomorrow is the finals. If you play this way against the cartoon pony, you will lose. I just won, man. Can you just say something nice? I love my grandma. - What? - What? My grandmother is a very nice woman. Wipe that frown off your face. We have a party tonight. Right. I don't know. Is it too much to wear a dress? I'm not going to answer that. You're the expert on what squash people wear. Ma. This is at some big fancy house... for players who made it to the championship. I knew you'd make it to the finals. That's weird, because you told me I wouldn't. Reverse psychology. You're coming tomorrow, right? I wish I could but if I start blowing off my clients, they'll get somebody else. But this is important. It's a four bedroom and that's $200. I need to get ready. You're late. Can you not? Here. Soda. It is poison, but tonight is special. These are some of our main benefactors for the Urban Squash League. If you screw up, you owe me $50,000. So, what do I do? Just mingle, shake hands, eat a scrumptious sashimi cone. And if I say something dumb? If you say something dumb, don't say it again. You belong here as much as they do. Excuse me, I see my ex-lover. Oyster shooter? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Marisol. We saw you play today. So many great kills. Thanks. - Nice to meet you. - Now, I don't wanna sway you, but I could see you at my alma mater in Cambridge. Why don't you just say Harvard? Harvard people always do that. Well, maybe you're a Stanford girl. You've been playing such a short time, and you're already amazing. You could go anywhere. Duke, Cal. Maybe I'll go to all of them. Marisol? I thought that was you. Hi. I had no idea you played squash. How do you two know each other? My mom cleans her house. She's wonderful. She works really hard. We love our cleaning lady. Her name's Renata. See? It went well. No tears. I told you. I don't cry. I'm not talking about you. This is the one? It's a nice house. Thanks for the ride. Oh, and... I don't live in the house. How was the party, baby? Fun. Hi, Pepita! Swings. Activate your shoulders. Okay. My mom is here, so... And she'll still be here at the end of the match. Do you want to greet her as a winner or as a loser who forgot to activate shoulders? You choose. You look nervous. How could I not be after that little pep talk you just gave me? In the words of the great rapper, my personal hero, the RZA, aka Bobby Digital, "I come for darkness and lightness will appear. You got to disappear through this chamber of fear." Score, Rosado. That's my sister out there! Marisol! Marisol! Marisol! - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Ref, can I have a let? Yes, let. Replay the point. Rosado to serve. Come on, that was an accident. I won that point. Are you blind? Conduct warning to Miss Rosado. How is that a conduct warning? You missed the call! Conduct penalty point to Miss Rosado for continued verbal abuse. I didn't abuse you, man! - Ansley to serve. - That's bullshit! Can I have a time-out, please? - Time-out, please. - Time-out granted. Three minutes. Time-out, Rosado. - What the hell are you doing? - Who cares? They're not gonna let me win anyway. Who's "them"? The only thing that matters here is you. He made a call. You threw a fit. - You need to focus and get back in there. - No. I'm not gonna get back in there. - So, fine, go home and cry? - Maybe I will! Hey. Hey! I told you if you make a bad decision, there's always an opportunity to fix it. The ball always comes back. But that was squash. This is life. We don't always get another shot. Marisol, Marisol... Come on. Come on. Ansley, your serve. Good game. Yeah, you too. You're really good. I'm Charlotte, by the way. I know. I'm Marisol. Yeah, I heard your brother chanting your name. I'll see you around. See ya. Oh, my God! Marisol! My squash warrior! You were amazing! Wasn't she? Hell, yeah! I am so proud of you. Why would you be proud of me? I lost. What do you mean you lost? You got second place. You were almost the best! Oh, Pepita. Come here, my love. My love. Okay. - Ma. - Ma. - Gracias, Ma. - Sí, Pepita.
