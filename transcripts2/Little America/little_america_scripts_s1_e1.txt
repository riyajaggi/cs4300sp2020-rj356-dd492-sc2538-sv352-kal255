 That's short for "Kentucky Fried Chicken." And it's actually right here in Green River. I'm so sorry. Kabir, go to your father. Do your homework. Just a heads-up. Don't bother asking for the Colonel. He's never there. [IN HINDI] Go inside. That's one precocious kid. [MOTHER] How may I help you? [MAN] Do you know a good place to eat around here? - [MOTHER] There's a Pancake House... - Dad. - Mm-hmm? - What's "precocious" mean? Look it up in a dictionary. Where's the dictionary? Up there. I got that dictionary when I first came to this country. Whenever I didn't know a word, I would look it up. And once I learned it, I'd highlight it with a marker. It doesn't look like you learned many words. Just look up your word, hey? "Of a child having developed certain abilities at an earlier age than usual." Oh. I saw a kid changing for gym who might be precocious. [SCOFFS] Here. Precocious. Precocious. [HINDI MUSIC PLAYING] Okay. Ready, Seema? - Watch this! You watch this. - Yeah. Okay. Here we go. - Ah! - Yes! [FATHER] How'd you hit it so far? [SPEAKING HINDI] [FATHER] Ah! How did you do that, hey? How'd you do that? Tendulkar. Hey! [FATHER] Ah! Welcome to KFC. Can I take your order? Three chicken sandwich value meals, please. And three Pepsis, please. Soda on a school night? Cool. [SPEAKING HINDI] She should leave this idiot, Sandip, for Rohit. [IN HINDI] No, she shouldn't. [IN HINDI] She's crazy. - Ma. - Hmm? Do you know "albumen"? - What's an albumen? - "The white part of an egg." I'll still call it "the white part of an egg." Dad said he'd buy me a Trans Am if I learned every word in the dictionary. Now you're buying him a car? Dad and I crunched the numbers. - How many words? - Oh, uh, Webster's has 460,000 words. Only 460,000. And I have until I'm 16. Boom! Trans Am! [MIMICKING PIANO NOTES] A-A-A-A. N-N-N-N. A-A-A-A. A-A-A-A. A-A-A-A. C-C-C-C. C-C-C-C. C-C-C-C. H-H-H-H. R-R-R-R. O-O-O-O. N-N-N-N. I-I-I-I. S-M. Anachronism! [SEEMA] Kabir, one, two, three. Remember, tighten the corners. That's right. Good job. [KABIR] Dactylic. D-A-C-T-Y-L-I-C. Dactylic. A-R-R-H-Y-T-H-M-I-A. Arrhythmia. Excuse me. Hi. I'm looking for Krish Jha. Dad, this lady was looking for you. Hi. I'm Miss Dubeck. Oh. Miss Dubeck, I'm Krishan Jha. Thank you so much for coming. - Please, come in. - All right. Would you like any tea or coffee? No, thanks. Kabir, here. Come. You man the desk. And study your words. - [DOOR OPENS] - This way. [DOOR CLOSES] This is my wife, Seema. [SEEMA] Hello. [MISS DUBECK] Nice to meet you, Mrs. Jha. Um, Mr. and Mrs. Jha, I wish... I was coming with better news. Um, but right now, it looks like we're looking at it possibly being extradition and deportation. [PRAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [VEHICLE HORN HONKS] Our cab's here. [IN HINDI] Don't forget to have breakfast every morning. - Mm. - Hmm? - Vijay. - Bye. Bye. [SPEAKS HINDI] This is my friend I was telling you about. And this is Kabir. He's going to take good care of you and the motel while we're away. You're clear on everything? [SPEAKS HINDI] Thank you. Yeah. I'm between jobs anyway now. Helps both of us. [SPEAKS HINDI] Go. Say bye to your parents. Oh, okay. [EXHALES SHARPLY] [DOOR CLOSES] Hello. We'll only be gone a short time, until we get our papers sorted out. And I've given Vijay some money to keep an eye on you. Okay? We'll call you every night. I promise. Skype. We'll Skype. It's free. [SNIFFLES] Don't cry, Ma. I'll see you soon. I'll water your plants every day. - Come. - Okay. [ENGINE STARTS] I'll see you soon! [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] You have a light, man? I'm 12. I don't need your whole life story. [SIGHS] This place is a dump. No, it's not. It's the number-three midrange motel in Green River, Utah. You should know that if you're gonna be the manager. I'm not managing this place. I'm just here to make sure you don't die. Then who's the manager? You are, little man. [HINDI MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, show me your science fair project. It's tomorrow, no? [KRISHAN] Wow. What is that? It's a homemade lava lamp. Welcome to the Economy Value Inn. How may I assist you today? [MUSIC CONTINUES] Know who I am? Batman. What are you gonna be for Halloween? UNITED STATES MAIL SERVICE - A FedEx driver. - [CHUCKLES] Did the plumber come? - I scheduled him for tomorrow. - Good. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Why are you always looking in that thing? If I learn every word, Dad's buying me a Trans Am. [SCOFFS] Should've asked for a Porsche. Trans Am is a trash auto. What's wrong with you, Beta? You've been gone for four months. What's going on? Your mother and I are writing letters every day to the proper offices. Every day. Who you waiting on now? Department of Homeland Security. They oversee immigration. I've written to them 14 times. As a federal employee, I can say with confidence that writing to the government is a giant waste of time. It's a bureaucratic issue. But it's your fault this happened. You lack prospicience. That means "foresight." [KRISHAN] These things take time. Everything is good at home? Yeah. Any news from your parents? These things take time. I am praying for them every Sunday at church. Thanks. You know, Kabir, every year you win the school spelling bee. Have you thought about competing at the state competition at Salt Lake? I bet you'd win. [CHUCKLES] And then you could go to Nationals. I mean, think about it. Have you ever been to Washington, DC? You know, the finalists meet the First Lady. Wouldn't that be something? Ms. Wren... I run an Economy Value Inn off Route 22. We're the third-ranked motel in Green River, according to TripAdvisor, and I'd like to keep it that way. I don't have time for spelling bees. Just thought I'd ask. [VIJAY] I told you. The government doesn't give a shit about you. Yes, they do. They have to. Only if they think you're dangerous. You know, every time you write one of these agencies, your name goes on a list. - What else am I supposed to do? - Maybe you go straight to the top. Write to President Bush. Maybe he'll help you. Seems like a solid guy to have a beer with. Logorrhea. L-O-G-O-R-H-E-A. Logorrhea. [RINGS BELL] [SIGHS] Kabir, for the state championship and the opportunity to attend the Keys All-American Spelling Bee in Washington, DC... can you spell "prospicience"? But you have to take me to DC. I can't go without a chaperone. I don't have to do shit. I'm not taking you to DC. Can't you at least lie to my teacher and say you're gonna take me? I'll get there on my own. That would open me up to criminal prosecution. Unless you were to make it worth my while. I don't have money. But didn't you just win a gift card to Applebee's? Asshole. - Come again? - Asshole. Yeah, we're pulling into DC now, Mrs. Wren. Kabir, look. The Washington Memorial. You two are going to have so much fun. I know we are, Mrs. Wren. If Kab... No. When Kabir meets Laura Bush, tell her I'm a huge fan. I'll be sure to do that. See you soon. [KABIR] This must be the number one hotel in DC. Mmm, definitely not. Wow. Great sprinkler system. What year did you put this in? I'm not sure. [GASPS] Cool. Kohler Whitehaven sinks. Impressive. Let us know if you... your... Your parents need anything else. Yeah. - A SentrySafe in every room? - [KEYPAD BEEPS] Great facilities you have here. Thank you. I manage a motel back home. Okay. Thank you for your service. Good luck. [DOOR OPENS] [SIGHS] [DOOR CLOSES] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [FEMALE ANNOUNCER] Okay, parents. Please take your seats, and welcome to the 2007 Keys All-American Spelling Bee. Kabir Jha, Green River, Utah. [JUDGE] The word is "succedaneum." "A substitute or replacement for something else." [KABIR] Succedaneum. S-U-C-C-E-D-A-N-E-U-M. Succedaneum. - [JUDGE] Correct. - [APPLAUSE] Sprachgefühl. "The essential character of a language." Sprachgefühl. S-P-R... C-H... U-H-L. Sprachgefühl. [APPLAUSE] [JUDGE] The word is, "vivisepulture." The act of burying someone alive. [KABIR] Can you use it in a sentence, please? Years ago, many people were afraid of accidental vivisepulture. Vivisepulture. V-I-V-I... S-E-P... U-L... T-U-R-E. Vivisepulture. - Correct. - [APPLAUSE] That concludes the round. Congratulations to our 13 finalists. [CHEERS, APPLAUSE] Hello, welcome to the White House. [LAURA BUSH] Congratulations, everybody. I saw some of the words that you spelled, and I know I could never spell those words. [CHUCKLES] You are all so very impressive. Why don't we go around the circle and you could tell me your name and where you're from? Let's start with you. It's okay, honey. Just... What's your name? Kabir. Kabir Jha. Well, hello, Kabir. Where are you from? "Dear Ms. First Lady Laura Bush," it is a great honor to be here with you, but I must ask for you to help me. My parents have both been sent back to India while they are awaiting asylum here in the United States. They have already been gone for more than a year and I miss them. And they are good people, you must believe me. And, please, I know you are a good woman. Can you please help me get them back? "Sincerely, Kabir Jha." Dear, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Can you help me? Well, you see, these things, they're very complicated. And they just sometimes take a long time. That's what everyone says. Why don't you write a letter to my office? I'm very sorry, Kabir. Okay. So who's next? How about you? What is your name? I'm Grace Colmer from Omaha, Nebraska. [SNIFFS] [WOMAN] Kabir Jha. You look pretty young to be a motel manager. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Yeah. I'm snaking a drain. This place is a dump. Well, maybe next time don't brush your hair in the sink. You have a good one. [MAN] ♪ If I had to choose just one day ♪ ♪ To live within my heart ♪ Shelton. Shelton. Sir? Just try to remember. Don't go against the grain, okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. I gotcha. I gotcha. I'm really more of an auditory learner. Mm-hmm. - That's fine. - Yeah. I got faith in you. You know, you're gonna be assistant manager here someday. Yeah? [CHUCKLING] All right. [SHELTON SINGING] ♪ If I had to choose just one day ♪ ♪ To live within my... ♪ - Oh, come on, you can do better than that. - Dude, I'm trying. - I can't beat him. Oh, my God. - This is the fifth time. Come on. - [MAN] You lose. - [SIGHS] Yo, what happened to your weirdo uncle? He's not my uncle. And, uh, he's in Salt Lake cooking in some fancy restaurant. Hey, Kabir, Stephanie's parents came home from their trip early. Everyone wants to know if they can come here to hang. Yeah, yeah, should be fine. As long as it's just them, okay? We're good to go. - Trying to run a business here. - It's just a few girls. - [LOUD HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] - [LOUD CHATTER] Dude. Dude, dude, dude. Could you do that outside? I'm sorry. It's just... It's a nonsmoking room. The guests get all weird about the smell... Just Febreze it. [MAN SINGING IN HINDI] [HIP-HOP MUSIC FADES] [INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING] [INDIAN MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC FADES] [KNOCK AT DOOR] - [KABIR MURMURS] - [KNOCKING] Mr. Jha?
