 If you act now, we'll also include our energy-boost protein powder. This is an exciting opportunity to get in on the ground floor. That offer is only for the next 24 hours. Our Sonalife Daily Vitamin is our number one product that I have my entire family use. Ai, we're going to Chipotle. You want us to wait? Can you bring me back the biggest burrito they have? I'm going to stay here and get the bonus. You're gonna make us look bad. Our products are backed by a full money-back guarantee, but I've never had a customer ask for a refund.

 Can I interest you in a starter pack? No, no, I'm okay. Please don't hang up. I'm pregnant. But that doesn't mean you can't save a lot of money before I go to the hospital. Call my husband! Make sure he picks up Bo. Deep breaths, ma'am. How do you say "deep breaths" in Chinese? I speak English. She's so pretty. I just updated your chart. Everything looks great. I'm down the hall if you need anything. I'm a brother now! Look at our family.

 I have to take this. Here, Bo. You're in charge. Film your sister. She's your younger sister. I'm Bo. I'm your older brother. Don't be afraid! How are you, little sister? Aloha! Finish your broth! All the nutrients are at the bottom. - We're trying. - We're trying. I'll pick you up at 4:00. We can go to Noodle King for dinner. Can't. I've Welcome Wizards. I have dance rehearsal. But today is Family Friday. I'll get takeout and we can eat together at home after. And don't worry. I'll wait to eat until you arrive. And don't forget we have plans tomorrow. Expo! - Again. Why? - We're never gonna win. We're going to win. We'll win, and we'll go on our first spring break holiday. You know your mother has good luck. You said that last year, and we spent the whole break watching old videos and singing karaoke. I almost won last year. You can't almost win a raffle. They just pick a name out of a bowl. Yeah. But wouldn't it be fun for the three of us to go on an adventure together? Mom, it's okay. We don't need to go on some fancy vacation. I got to study for my PSATs anyway. Bye, Mom. Home early! - Bye, Mom. - Hey. Bye-bye! I love you! Come on! You come on! I was telling my kids I love them. Up, up, up! Expo time! Can I just have one weekend to myself? It's our lucky day. The weather is terrible. No one will want to go to the expo. We're still not gonna win. I told you, you have to wear socks. Or your blood will freeze and your heart will stop. That's never happened to anyone, ever. Tell that to Feng Hua. She was 93 and she had cancer. Just go without us. It is the storm of the century, everybody. Stay home. Stay safe. And whatever you do, stay off the road. Not many people here today. Under the Tuscan Sun. Feeling lucky. All right. And the winner of the grand prize Alaskan cruise is... Ai Wang. It's the biggest boat ever! Oh, my God. Race you to the ship! I'll give you a ten-second head start. Come on. Hurry up! C'mon, hurry up. We can't be late. - You're upset about this shirt? - Bo-Bo. Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the Grand Americana. They call me Craig because my name is Craig. You got it. Anyhoo, I'm gonna be your dedicated cruise concierge. We have a wide range of activities, like panning for gold, totem pole carving. But for my money, the best part of this cruise is sunrise on the roof deck. All that Alaskan majesty. Talk about Mother Nature showing off. Okay. You guys are Room 1104, so you're gonna take the elevators down the hall. Bo, get the luggage. And tonight, join the captain on the deck for cocktails and mocktails. Family photo? Yes. Hold on. No, Mom. Come on. Mom. We have a balcony and everything! Take off your shoes! - Check it out! - Oh, my gosh! Look at that view! I can't believe this. - I can't believe you won this, Mom. - Oh, my gosh! Bo! Bo! Bo! Hit it! - Don't you dare! - Mom! Mom! Catch! You guys, I just saw a dolphin! Bo-Bo! I can't believe we're here. This is the biggest restaurant I've ever seen. I'm gonna get a Shirley Temple. Enjoy your meal. We'll take a private table. We are the Getaway Expo grand prize winners. All seating's communal. Your first cruise. Come on. Have a seat. We'll give you the rundown. A little tip, don't go crazy at the salad bar. They're just trying to fill you up before the prime rib. Save your appetite for the main event. What's your name? Tell them I don't speak English. Don't be weird, please. I didn't come to this cruise to talk to other people. I came to talk to my kids. My mom's name is Ai. She doesn't really speak English. Cheng. What we're seeing here is the unparalleled beauty of ice calving, the breaking away of icebergs from the glacier itself. Mom? Can I go to teen club? Just, like, for an hour? Don't leave. We're going to find out about baby seals next. I'm so happy we're here together. Harbor seals like to stay close to home. And much like humans, the gestation period for a baby seal pup is nine months. Hey, Bo! Reapply your sunscreen. You'll get skin cancer! I already have sunscreen on. But you know the sun makes your acne flare up. Mom! It's natural. It's puberty. Where are you going? Everyone's going to teen club, and I wanna try out my new Magic deck. Fine. Cheng and I will go see the king crabs. I heard they're mating. I'm going with Cheng. You sure you don't want to go? Actually, teen club has a hair-braiding workshop I wanna go to. Okay. That sounds fun. I can learn to braid your hair. It's not really how it works, Mom. Teen club's just for teens and preteens. But we'll see you at dinner, okay? Oh. Yeah. Dinner starts at 5:00 p.m. Get there on time so you can help me order. Great. Have fun. Bye. Love you! From relaxing pursuits and enriching activities to world-class entertainment and gourmet cuisine, we have everything to make your vacation dreams come true. When you step aboard our Alaskan cruise lines, you're setting a course for a world of amazing new discoveries. Are you seriously having another beer? Yeah, I'm on vacation. It was so sick, you know? Yeah, totally. Nice. You're late. Barely. It's 5:14! We said 5:00 p.m. sharp. I waited all day for you. You just waited for us all day? No. I did lots of stuff. Plenty of stuff. Like what? Guess what I did. I learned how to French braid, and I made this bracelet. - Yo! - Oh, dude, what's up? You must be Bo's mom. I'm Theresa. I'm Sean's aunt. Isn't it fantastic the boys made friends? The best thing about a cruise is that these kids just get lost. I mean, "Get out of my hair," right? Save me. Anyway, Sean told me that you're divorced. I'm gonna take care of you. How about you and I hit karaoke tomorrow? Karaoke. Sounds fun. I'm not doing karaoke with this woman. So, I'm gonna come find you tomorrow. Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Okay. - Come on. - Later, dude. Today was so cool. Sean and I played Magic. I pulled out a bird of paradise on the first draw. It was awesome. Isn't this place amazing, Mom? Wake up! Wake up! They were out of bacon at the buffet. But they had turkey sausage. There she is, my grand prize winner. How can I help you? I need a map of the ship. I need to know where kids go. Can't find your kids, huh? Yep. We see it all the time. Usually happens on the third day. I'm sure they're having a great time. Now, why don't we find something fun for Mom to do? Here, you could lie out on the deck, smell that fresh sea air. You should enjoy it. Take advantage. By the way, did you take my advice and check out the top deck at sunrise? My kids would not wake up. Well, you don't need your kids to enjoy a sunrise. Here we have water aerobics. You could get your fitness on, move a little bit. Okay, no. There's singo. - "Singo"? - Singles bingo. Really fun. - I don't date. - Okay. Do you gamble? I am lucky. Okay. There's something. Hey, Tristan. Can I get a starter pack? Thank you. Thanks. Okay, a little freebie. You got a five-dollar token and a drink ticket. It's good for any bar on the ship. I got to get back to my station, but, remember, I'm always here if you need me. What we're seeing here is the unparalleled beauty of ice calving... the breaking away of icebergs from the glacier itself. Bo, Cheng. Let's go. I'm in the middle of a game. Boom. Six damage. I said let's go. Mom, he's about to win. Are you trying to ultimate Jace? Bo, I'm speaking to you. One sec. - Now! - Mom! Really? Okay, that's a tilt. It doesn't matter if it's your mom, but that's a forfeit. I win. We're on vacation together. How could you leave me? I was alone all day. What are you even talking about? You were alone for one day. "Bo, kiss me on the cheek. Bo, order this. Bo, talk for me." What is wrong with you? It's okay, Mom. I'll go get him and meet you at dinner. So, are you having a good cruise, or what? No. It's sad. Everyone here is sad. Well, yeah. But that's everywhere, isn't it? I mean, at least here they give you all-you-can-eat shrimp. One glass of red wine, please. Do you have any soda? Ginger ale in... Yes. Yes. I never drink. Thank you. One more. Blackjack. Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets. Last chance to place your bets. And we've got an eight. Lucky number eight. All right. Karaoke night continues. And let's see, up next are Gail and Ben from Kansas. They had one stood up forever. Yeah! You got this. When I said I needed you. You said you would always stay. It wasn't me who changed, but you. And now you've gone away. Don't you see that now you've gone. And I'm left here on my own. That I have to follow you. And beg you to come home. You don't have to say you love me. Just be close at hand. You don't have to stay forever I will understand. Wake up. Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you. You're making the right decision. Believe me I'll never tie you down. Left alone with just memories. We've had her two years. She's very healthy. We wouldn't want to give her up, but we've been blessed with a child of our own. A boy. You're good luck. There's nothing left to feel. Dad! Mom! Just be close at hand. You don't have to stay forever I will understand. Believe me, believe me. You don't have to say you love me Just be close at hand. You don't have to stay forever I will understand. Believe me, believe me. Believe me. Yeah! Good job. Mom, is that you? Yes, Bo-Bo. Thanks, Mom.
