 Attention! You all come! I want to make a toast to my oldest daughter Beatrice. Out of my 22 children... Beatrice is the most special. Relax! You know I love you all. Just... Beatrice a little bit more. On the day of Beatrice's birth, her mother Yuliana grabbed my face and made me promise... our first daughter would have the best education there was. At the time, it was an easy promise to make.

 I didn't know how much bread I would have to sell to make it happen. Beatrice, stand. It took... at least... 10,000 crates of chapati! Daddy, you're making those numbers up. My daughter... I didn't choose to be a baker. I became a baker because my father was a baker. But we are giving you the opportunity to find your own path. My point is go abroad, study hard and make us proud. Don't mess this up, Chosen One. I'll send for you when I become rich and famous.

 Daddy, the food was delicious. Mama. Are you crying? No. It's smoke from the oven. Come here. I made you something, in honor of your trip to America. American-style chocolate chips cookie. Dad, where did you find chocolate? I know a guy who knows a guy. Do you like it? I love America already! You're going to do great things. But don't forget Uganda. Too sweet. Congratulations on your divorce. - Yes. - Yeah! The hell with him. You are finally free of that asshole. Oh, thank God. Oh, my God. That's my song. What was that last drink? Sex on the Beach? That was a bad idea. - That was the one that did it. - Long... Long Island. Rochelle, give me your keys. - I can't believe we stayed out so late. - Give us the keys. Beatrice, your babysitter's gonna be mad. - Okay. - Should we open the door? Rochelle, shh. Quick, let's just open the door. - You're gonna... You're too loud. - Open... Keep your voices down. Brian is sleeping. - I'm sorry, Eunice. - Sorry we are late. I'm so sorry. We were celebrating. I'm going to bed. It's already tomorrow. You said you'd be home at 11. Eunice, why are you so serious? Next time you should come dancing with us. Good night, roomies. How was he? I hope he wasn't difficult. I know I owe you from last time. 10, hey? But here, take... This is 1. Are you drunk? Give me a break. I really needed some fun. I have church in the morning, and you have robbed me of my sleep just as you have robbed me of my money. Eunice, I'll bring the rest tomorrow when I bring Brian. You will not. You owe me too much. Other families pay me. Please! I have a shift. You should have thought of that before you contracted Saturday Night Fever. Get your life together. Mommy? Baby, what are you doing awake? It's the middle of the night. I smell cookies. Can I have one? No. These are for people at Mommy's work. - Please. - Okay. One. We'll split it, okay? And then back to bed. Is it good? Yummy, yummy. Hello? Brian, where's your mother? She's here. She's asleep. Dear Jesus! Hello, Mommy. Bea-Bea, were you asleep? It's almost 11:00 a.m. there. No, no. I've been up for hours. Grab Mommy's uniform and shoes. Hurry. I hear you were out dancing last night. Mama, why do you call me when you can just get your information from Eunice? If my daughter told me what was going on in her life, I wouldn't have to talk to Eunice. Ma, I have to go work... A degree in marine science, but you are handing out french fries. Thank God your father is not alive to see this. You're divorced, sleeping on your friends' couch... What kind of life do you want for Brian? It's time to come home. You've become a spoiled American. Okay, Mama. My love, you're the first woman in our family to go to college. Why do you continue wasting your education? Mum, I got to go to work. Bye. - Wait... - Come. - Is Frank around? - At dialysis. - Okay. - Oh, no. I know. I know. Baby, come. Okay, go sit at that booth and don't move. I'm going to bring you crayons, and don't eat them again. When Frank comes, what are you going to do? - Hide. - Yes. - Hi. - Beatrice, they put the peppers in. The bastards. I'll have Mike make you a new one. In the meantime... Your cookies are the real reason we come here. When are you going to let us feed you? When you make pizza edible. You are a crazy person. Everyone loves pizza. It just feels like half an idea. - Excuse me. - Okay. Baby, put that down. Drop it. Why are you doing that? It's boring here. I'll get you a snack. Hey, sweetheart. How you doing? What's he doing here? He wanted to see you after your dialysis. How are you doing, Frank? I'm not great. My kidneys aren't great. It's just today. It's always "just today"! It was today yesterday, and it's gonna be today tomorrow. Damn it! Look, this is it. I can't have a kid running around in here. I lost my babysitter. Frank, cut her some slack. I'm not the bad guy here. I let you sell your cookies at the register. Because you take half my profit. Because it's my business. I warned you last time. If you can't get a babysitter, you can't work here. Get out. Frank, I have a child to support. I need this job. You're fired. Then I'm taking my cookies with me. Come. - And your pies suck! - Yeah, well, your cookies... Well, they're good. - I'm tired. - We are almost home, okay? Can you just please walk? You are big boy now. Walk. - I don't want to. - Please. My arms are tired. - Carry me! No, no! - Please. - Carry me! Carry me! - Brian, stop it. That's a tough age, huh? Are you currently happy with your brand of lipstick? What? I'm introducing the neighborhood to a new line of cosmetics for the working woman. I just lost my job. I was unemployed, too, until Avon saved my life. And now I'm my own boss. Let me give you a free sample. Have a great day! Don't worry. Mommy's going to fix this. Excuse me. Hi. May I help you with something? Yes. I'm looking for a lady's suit. Okay. What kind? A successful business suit. Like Connie Chung or like Dynasty? Actually, I don't even know why I'm asking. We only have one. It is $4, it's green and it's right here. What do you think of that? Hello. I am introducing the neighborhood to a new line of very exciting cookies. Oh, no, thank you. Hello. I'm here in the neighborhood introducing a new line of exciting cookies. Hello. Would you like to buy a delicious cookie? Sorry, I already bought a pack of Oreos. These are better than Oreos. Got to get them before they get into the supermarket. Excuse me, sir. Are you interested in buying a cookie? What's this, for charity or something? Y'all saving the whales? For eating. I'm not really a dessert guy, but here. It's for your kid. You forgot your cookie. He doesn't want it. Excuse me, sir. Can I introduce you to a new line of exciting... You can't be here. There's no soliciting. But I've seen people selling cookies here before. Yeah, Girl Scouts. We can't have any panhandlers. I'm not panhandling. I'm selling cookies. Just do it somewhere else. Thank you. I am never shopping at that Piggly Wiggly again. Don't you dare answer that. You know who it is, and you're just starting to feel better. If I don't pick it up, she'll keep calling. If you do pick it up, you'll feel like garbage. I already do. I can't pay you rent. I'm divorced. I was supposed to be here two weeks. It's been eight months. We don't mind. We love having you here. And I just got fired by a guy who makes key lime pie with lemons. Have you told your mom you got fired? Never. Can you imagine? "Oh, my God, Bea-Bea." You went to college and you can't even keep a job at a diner. And now you are out there in the street selling the cookies. Oh, my God. "Cookies, cookies, who wants a cookie?" - Oh, my God. - What? Excuse me, that is a superpower. Okay, I might be really drunk, but you go out there like that, and... No, seriously, that shit's gonna make you famous. Come on, every woman in Uganda can do this. But, girl, you're in Louisville, Kentucky. Cookies. Cookies. We are selling cookies. Who wants cookies? Cookies. Cookies. Do you like some cookies? - Smile. - No, thank you. Cookies. The best cookies in Louisville. No, thank you. - Cookies. Co... - Hey. I dig your outfit. Those colors... Why is that on your head? I'm selling some cookies. 50 cents for one, but for you, my friends, I'll give you two for $1. Hell, yeah. We'll take, like, a lot. Like a dozen? I'll give you a discount. We totally need a dozen. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. And 12. Go get the money. How's that staying on your head right now? African magic. Cookies. Cookies. - That car smells funny. - Who wants a cookie? The best cookies in Louisville. Cookies. Dear Jesus! I thought being a waitress at a restaurant was the bottom. But now you are a waitress on the sidewalk. Mama. This isn't Uganda. It's not shameful work here. I'm selling cookies. Dad was a baker. I can take care of my son like Dad took care of us. Bea-Bea, my love... those cookies have made your brain soft. What must Brian think when he sees you begging on the sidewalk? I have spoken with your brothers. We have pooled together the money for you to come home. We emptied our savings, and we are giving it to you to come back. I've had some ups and downs, but I finally found something that I'm good at. And it's working. Mama, you and Dad sent me here to succeed, and I will succeed. It's not up for discussion. Call me tomorrow after you've received the money. Enjoy. Thank you. Yes, how can I help you? Hey! Hello. Two chocolate chip for Louisville's finest. On the house. No, thank you, ma'am. You can't do this here. It's okay. I'm a taxpayer. Okay. Well, you still can't just sell food on the street. What's the matter? Am I in trouble? What's your name? Beatrice Mukasa. - Bea... "Mukasta"? How do you spell it? - Mukasa. - How do you spell that? - M-U-K-A-S-A. What's the problem? You need a commercial license and a retail space. A what? All right. You can pay that down at city hall. Pay? Well, that's how it works in this country. "And then at night, all the animals return to their homes to sleep." Would you like that? To go to a faraway land. And you can meet your grandma. - And your uncles. - Yeah. And animals. And we could even see real zebras. I wanna go. If you like, I could even teach you how to bake bread in the ground. In the ground? Your grandfather used to dig a big hole in the ground and fill it up with charcoal. Hot, hot charcoal. And then he would give me soft dough and he'd let me stuff it in in the coals, and then we'd wait until it puffed up. Then he'd give me a chunk of it. It was so hot, you would even burn your hands. The best bread I ever had. Uganda. Uganda. Uganda. Okay, it's gonna be three segments. Louisville to JFK, JFK to Gatwick, and Gatwick to... Entebbe. Entebbe. Right. $1,800 if he sits on your lap. I think that's a pretty good deal for this time of year. Tell that to my eight brothers who had to chip in. You must be really excited to go back, huh? Hello? Excuse me, can I help you? You stole my money! I'm sorry. I know it seems crazy, but I had to do it. I will pay you back. Your father and I did not raise you to be this way! You are a selfish American! Going to America was your dream. Not mine. You're right. It was my dream. You got a chance every girl here would die for. And you squandered it! And you are a thief! You bet on me by sending me to this country. Now I'm betting on me. You are not my daughter. Mama. You don't mean that. I do! Wait! That is mine. Where are you taking my counter? To the truck. Hey, Beatrice, don't worry. The space will be cleared out in 15 minutes. Cleared out? Why? Well, all the equipment and furniture are moving across town. - Excuse me. - We got our new restaurant there. What about the oven? Gotta take that too. Aw, no, did you think all this stuff came with the space? Sorry. Finally! You came for a pizza. Quick favor. What time do you guys close? 10:00 p.m. 11:00 p.m. on weekends. Why? Just remember to pull down the gate after you lock up. Thank you. I'll pay you guys back as soon as I make anything. No one is here anyway. Now, don't open the door for anyone. Sometimes there's a crazy drunk man who comes around. Does he like cookies? I'm serious. - Thank you. - Okay, bye-bye. Free samples of cookies! Get your free cookie samples. Here you go. Take two. - Thanks. Have a good day. - Thank you. Yeah! Thank you. Hi. Hello? Hello, Mama... Thank you. Hello, Mama. Brian. Welcome, Grandma! Your mama tells me you love zebras. Huh? Thank you, Grandma. Let me take your bag. This is my new place. You'll take my room. You rest. I'll make you something to eat. I'm glad you're here, Mama. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Bye, Cookie Lady. Bye-bye, my friends. My mom is the Cookie Lady! Yes, she is! Brian, come over here and sit down with me. Mama. Come. Chocolate chip. How is it? Very sweet. Thank you, Mama. Brian. Show me which one you want. I know which one you are going to choose. Come! - Which one? - Cinnamon roll. - Which one? - Cinnamon roll. Bring your money.
