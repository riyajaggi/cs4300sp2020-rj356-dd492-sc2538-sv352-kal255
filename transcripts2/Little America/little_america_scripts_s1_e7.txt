 We have a confit chicken thigh with winter squash, brown butter, pickled onion, benne seed, lovage, and lime. And as a starter, a frisée salad dressed in a chorizo citrus vinaigrette with a sous vide duck egg to finish. May I have it with a quail egg to finish? Unfortunately, the chef uses a duck egg. That's odd, because quail egg improves vision, reduces chronic disease. Plus, the larger yolk for satisfying flavor. Hello. I would like to speak to someone regarding your acquisition of quail eggs. Chef not here.

 May I leave you a delicious sample for your pleasure? Okay. Thank you! Excuse me. You know what would really pull this restaurant up to the major big leagues? Smaller eggs? May I leave you a delicious sample for your pleasure? Here's my card. Faraz! What's up, my man? Hey, Victor. What's up, my man? Wasn't Behrad supposed to work today? He had study group. Yes. He has a 3.65 GPA, my son, huh? I know. You always tell me.

 Hey, how was quail-egging? You know, I don't want to count my quails before they're born, but Momofuku just added quail eggs to their tasting menu. People are talking. People need to start buying. Don't worry. The restaurant industry is always hungry for new trends. For sure. It has this article on the best brunches in Brooklyn. Brooklyn will love quail eggs. - They're fascinated by newness. - Yeah. I saw the first season of Girls. Okay. - Sheila. Drive safe! - See you tomorrow. Hey, Craig! Go Knicks! Pistons suck! Good luck with the dentist. Yeah, yeah, yeah! I send you the recipe! - 3.5% is not gonna get that done. - Okay. So you got to make it worthwhile for me. Yasmin, come! You're missing Shark Tank. Their valuation is crazy. You always side with Lori. I think it's a smart idea. I don't think that I would be as good a partner for you as other people. Solely for that reason, I'm out. Later. Hey! - Where are you going? - It's trivia night. Trivia? Trivia can wait five minutes. Come. Sit with your parents. I haven't seen you all day. I'm good. Yeah. The store owner's making one dollar per $100 transaction or two dollars? - A dollar per transaction. - A dollar. So that means I have to risk $1,000 of my register for ten dollars. Enough with the mouse. We need to find a new apartment. I will call Super Manny in the morning. Okay? Jason's roommate's moving out. There's an open room there, so... The three of us in one room? I meant just me. And you're gonna leave your mother? Iranians don't leave until they get married. Iranian-Americans do. There is still an Iranian in there. Besides, why would you pay a stranger when you can just live here for free? Baby, you tell Super Manny to only use humane extermination. If one little mouse's spine gets broken, I'm gonna let him have it. I will take care of it, my queen. A chocolate to end your night sweetly. Merci. He's going to move in with his friends. It's what they do here. It's a bad system. But don't worry. I'll fix it. Super Manny, we see the mouse. You don't see the mouse? - I missed. - Pay for exterminator, Super Manny. Why I pay for exterminator? I see no mouse. Forget it. We're going to move out. Where can you go? Beverly Hills? No one should live like this, with a rodent. Okay, I tell you the truth. The owner, he does not want to pay for exterminator. I have tried. I told you to use the killing traps that I have given to you. I'll call you back. I thought you were good negotiating? What am I supposed to do? We need exterminator. Forget about this place. I'll buy us a house with stainless steel appliances, like back home. You always thinking of going to moon when we haven't left the ground. Why don't we start with getting rid of the rodents, huh? Yesterday, I'm taking a bath and the mouse is watching me. He wouldn't turn away. I cannot blame him. Even a rodent is transfixed by your beauty. Yas? I'm going to take you to the moon. Behrad. Shift is at two. I'll take us to dinner after. Yes, Dad. I'll be there. Troy! Jason. - Hey, Mr. S. - Hey. How are you? Hey. The Foragers. It's just "Foragers." No "the." You know, I can write up a business plan so the band can become profitable. You know who's a massive artist and a massive businessman? - Bono. - Bono. Yes! He owns, like, lots of castles. And he invested in Yelp. And he makes great music. You coming to our show next week? You're joking me? Your first concert? I'm going to be in the first row, video-ing everything. Now you have your foot in the door. And soon you will have two feet in even a bigger door. You're the Bono. You're the Edge. And you're... one of the other members of U2. And so it begins! Good job. It's cool your dad's a big kisser. My dad just shakes my hand. Hey. You know, Behrad's in a band. They have a gigantic concert next week. Watch. He will change his name to Barry. Nah. He loves his name, you know. See you next Saturday for football? Of course. Just take magazine. It's free. Great time to invest right here in Yonkers. It's exactly like New York, but less loud and much cheaper. The city that sleeps. You know, I love Yonkers. My son, Behrad, goes to CUNY Lehman. 3.65 GPA. Business administration. He's also a musician, like Bono from U2. You know, I want a home where he can have a room to practice his drums, and for my wife to have a home office. You know, she is an expertise tailor. This is the place. Bang for your buck. Only going up, up, up. And my credit score is 710. You mentioned that a few times. Don't worry. We'll find you a better place than you had in Iran. You know, people think I escaped Iran. I had a good life in Iran. A great life. I came to America to provide my family new and excellent opportunities. That was my choice. So, please, don't feel sorry for me. That's great. I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it. It's okay. This is a beautiful house. Yes, it is. The sellers are very motivated. And it's only 610,000. The house is very close to the street. And although the walk to the curb is quick, ultimately it will become a nuisance. And for this reasons, I'm out. Very close to the street. Very close. This is the one. Three bedrooms, two baths, and, oh, my gosh, there is the most charming attic with this beautiful floral paper. You're not gonna believe it. It puts the quaint in "quaint." It's just gorgeous. It's very nice. And the rent is very reasonable. Rent? I want to buy. Get out of here! My room! The listing agent said the squatter will be gone by next week. I'll never leave! Do you have anything for me to buy in my price range? This is what you get in your range. Wow! $65,000 for this? It's a steal. Well, yeah, it's only 65,000, but you see the rock, right? Well, it depends on how you look at it. You see a rock. I see an opportunity. Yes. This is where we will live. I'm going to make an offer of $64,000 and no more. Okay. Yas, Yas, Yas. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. Listen, listen, listen. So I was so nervous that someone might snap it up. So I told Ronni, my private Realtor, "What can I do to take this property off your hand today?" And now, I'm an American landowner! It's a beautiful investment property that I'm excited for. Okay. Let me show you photos. Hold on. But honey, dinner is ready. - Let's show photos. - Yes. We want to see. We want to see. Show us. Where is the house? I only see a massive rock. Is the house behind it? If you use your imagination, you can see a house. Okay. I still only see a rock. The rock is nothing. It's a very big rock. Easily demolished. I'm going to build a gigantic house. Behrad is going to have a room for his drums and a private bathroom. - Hey, dog. Congrats, my man. - Very nice. Okay. Let's eat. Food is getting cold. - Please, right this way. - Let's eat. Very fantastic, huh? Okay. Say "cheese." Cheese. Okay. I'm going to make a video for our friends back home. Try to frame out the rock. Hey, everyone. Welcome to Faraz Land, owned by me. The house is going to have lots of windows. It's going to be tough to clean, but it's okay. And the garden, it's going to be here. Hey? It's gonna have fresh mint for tea. It's going to be beautiful. All the time. What your dad pulled off here is really unbelievable. Yeah, he's a pretty amazing guy. Salâmati. You know why I'm really here. How do I get in on the quail egg business? Well... It's so big. It gets bigger the closer you get. You don't like it here? It's beautiful. It's just... we could have started with a larger apartment first. One with a whirlpool tub. You stay at the larger apartment. Behrad and I will live in a mansion, custom-built for us. Okay. I'll stay in the mansion with you. But first I have to go to the store. See you for dinner. Okay. Hello, my friend. Not so big. See you tomorrow. This was a brilliant idea, my love. Know your enemy. The government must divulge what previous owners attempted to do with the rock. That's what permits are for. So I pulled the plans from the property in question, but I need a signed and notarized affidavit from the titleholder to allow you to see them. But I'm the owner now. Shouldn't I be able to see the history of my property? You still have two more weeks in escrow. I cannot divulge that. What is that? - Honey. - I can't accept gifts. I insist. We can't. I'm sorry. Right down this way, to the left. My gloves. I'll be right back. Have you had quail eggs? What? A little-known fact. Quail eggs contain 13%... Got them. Thank you very much, Ms. Lianna. Goodbye. - Thank you. - Thank you. Where were you going to? I took pictures of the blueprints with my phone photo. Really? You can still... You're so bad. I put your name on the list for tonight so you don't have to pay a cover. Yes, yes, your concert. I already deleted the old video so I have lots of space to record. I don't even know if anyone's gonna show. I just hope we don't suck. Sorry. This is Clive. You called me. I wanted to get a quote from you for removal of a rock. Okay. How big is it? Not so big. About 8,000 square feet. How deep does it go? No one knows. Height? The height of a tall man. How tall is the tall man? Eight feet tall. That is a tall man. Wait, is this that property on Edwin? Yes. You already know it? Everybody knows it. Sorry, bub. Can't help you. What? Hello? Hello. Dead. I was impressed with your Yelp stars, so... do you think it's possible? Yes. From one immigrant to another... what can I do to get your men to remove my rock for $11,000? Eleven? That's all I have left. I pay my guys cash to provide a savings for my customers. Deal! Okay. I'll be back in two hours. Okay. How do you say... - Oh, yes. Gracias. - De nada. Okay. Explosion. Then this one over there. That one's next. Big one. Yeah, yeah. So... Oh, no, no, no. I have to go. I have to go. Sorry. Okay. I messed up. That concert meant a lot to him. I'm trying to build us a real home. This is what you do. You get focused on a project and everything else falls away. I swear, it was so much easier in Iran. There is so much red tape here. It just... But more reliable Wi-Fi. I know failure is a gift, but I'm getting a lot of gifts. I've spent almost all of our savings. What if I don't remove the rock and I lose Behrad in the process? - Lose Behrad? - Don't you see? If I don't get a bigger house, he's going to move in with the Foragers. Foragers, no "the." And then we will never see him. Azizam, you are pushing him away by holding on so tight. He's a growing boy, almost a man. So what do you suggest? Focus on Behrad like you would one of your projects. Treat him like the rock. Or the quail eggs. Or your idea of sunglasses for people with curly hair. I'm inspired by this. Okay. Okay. Let's see. Is it good? By the way, tomorrow afternoon, the first explosions are happening at the rock. Anyway, your father wants us to be there. This is very important to your father. Well, if it's important to him. Baby... I had words with him about the concert and everything. He's disappointed in his actions. He'll make it better. He lives in this fantasy world. That rock isn't moving and he's crazy if he thinks it will. Azizam, your father had his own livestock market in Tehran. He had the first digital photo studio in all of Iran. When he opened his roller-skating rink, the Revolutionary Guards almost threw him in jail. He sold our beautiful house in Tehran to work in a parking lot so you could go to United States college and you could play silly concerts in coffee shops and so you could have the freedom to be as ambitious or not ambitious as you want. So when your father says that he will build us a beautiful home, I know in my soul that it will happen. You think a stupid rock is going to stop him? You don't know your father. All clear! Hey, Jose. Señor. Come. Come. Can you please explain the process? How does it work with this exploratory explosion? Jose, come on. I press the button, and the charges explode. No, no. Do the countdown. One, two, three. Three, two, one. It's good. Jose, was it a success? I don't know. Jose doesn't know yet. High-tech radar. Very sophisticated. Okay. So what is the status? Over here... Rock goes down six feet and then it stops. Six feet? Very manageable. But over here... Ten feet. Like underground, a staircase. Many different heights. It's very big. Very big. Okay, so we bring a bulldozer and take the debris, and then we explode again. And then we explode again. And then, Jose, we explode again, huh? It's very big. Too big. It's... It's an ongoing process, you know? So... I got you. Come on. If I can't be all in, I have to fold. So I'm sorry. I'm out. Not a single offer. Our friend is back. - Has been called the disruptor. - Well, the point is... Azizam, what's wrong? Okay. Okay. Did I make a mistake? - Behrad! What's up, my man? - Hey, Victor. Hey, your dad left this here. Can you give it to him? Yeah. Hey, how'd the explosion go? I didn't make it. That's too bad. I love when shit blows up. All right. See you, man. One square foot of the rock. Seven thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine to go. Night. And we need a new pickax! - Baba. - Hey. You brought food? For the guys. This is my son, 3.65 GPA. Yeah, you mentioned. Looking good. Look how much progress we made, no? I got to tell you something. I've been saving up my money, and I've been thinking about it a lot, and I'm gonna rent that room in Jason's apartment. You're... a grown boy. You... are almost a man. I'm still gonna build you that room. If you want me to look over the rental agreement, I'm here. This is a major hit. Don't say that. You'll raise his expectation. No, no, no. This song inspires because it is about something. People aren't talking about the slaughter industry enough. This will be an anthem for vegans because they have had no anthem. Back to work. Smaller every day! He's never gonna stop, is he? No. You know your father.
