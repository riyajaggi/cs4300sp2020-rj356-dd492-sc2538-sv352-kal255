 - Please have some. - Looks delicious. Thanks. Don't touch! Habibi! I'm not the dessert, Grandmother. Thank Allah. No one likes sour Jazaryieh. Now that everyone is here... I have some news. He's burned the baklava again. Thank you, Father. With Allah's blessing, me and Lamma... Sorry to interrupt, Your Majesty.

 Is that a bee? It's work, sorry. I told them I'd be free by now. So give it to us. What is it, little brother? With Allah's blessing, me and Lamma would like to get married next month. Wow! Congratulations! And when is it your turn, Rafiq? Congratulations, Bro. I'll make coffee. I'M HERE. WHERE ARE YOU? We're out of sugar. I'll go get some. Okay. Be quick. Your family's here. I thought you weren't coming.

 I heard someone. I'm glad you came. I'm Tamim. It's okay. You're allowed to enjoy this. Well, no wonder there's no sugar. Someone threw the whole bag in the trash. I'll be back in a minute. I still need to buy sugar... This is for your own good. Dad, no! Stop! You did this to yourself! Dad! Please! Please! Dad! Don't stir so hard. You want the eggplant to be buttery. And not like water. I'm here. I'm here. Your Highness, thank you for gracing us with your presence today. What? I didn't understand a single word you say. You know the rules. I only speak English now. And what about my rules, Captain America? You are late again. Ghazal... don't be mad at me. I beg. Forgive me. Stand up, stop it. Come on. Enough with the melodrama. You know you're this close to being replaced. You know I'm irreplaceable, darling. Don't tempt me. So, you're the new guy? You got way more muscles than the last one. Don't. I'm sorry. YOUR BROTHER IS LOOKING FOR YOU. BE CAREFUL! Rafiq. Where are you going? Home. No, you're not. We're getting a drink. I thought the last table was never gonna leave. I was this close to feeding them napkins. Sorry. I must visit my brother. I thought you were going home. I'm going to Le Piano. Come with me. Relax, habibi. I wasn't hitting on you. Homo. Is it always like this when you walk around? - Always like what? - Everyone is looking at us. And they're not even paying. No. Who's that? You mean my girlfriend? Wait. You're being serious. This is blasphemy. My queen. You don't know Kelly Clarkson? Her lyrics are so deep. She won American Idol. I'm sure you know her. I don't think so. I'll spread my wings And I'll learn how to fly I'll do what it takes till I touch... Shut the hell up. People can hear you. Hey. Chill. I was just messing around. I don't want any trouble. Please, just leave me alone. You're gonna go pray? Syrians are such hypocrites. It's illegal to be gay, but they love to blow their long pipes in public. - You're crazy. - Thank you. Seriously. You're not afraid people will find out? Habibi, even pigeons know which way I swing. Of course I'm scared. If I could hide it, I would. I'm always afraid. That's why I come to Dimašq. To hide. I'm hiding too. That's why I'm practicing my English. I'm going to America soon. Wait, you're moving? I applied for asylum. And I'm waiting on my papers. I'm gonna be a Hollywood star. That's so cool. What kind of acting do you do? Movies mostly, but I think TV for fun. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine! I can jog all the way to Texas and back. But my daughter can't. She never could. I'm so mad. I don't know what to do. I want to know why. I wanna know why Shelby's life is over. I want to know how that baby will ever know how wonderful his mother was. Will he ever know what she went through for him? Oh, God. I wanna know why! Why? Okay, Sally Field. We like you. We really like you. But the whole restaurant can hear you. You are annoying the customers. They should be honored. Yalla. Zain? Habibi. - You have to meet my friend. - Okay. Rafiq. Come out here. I'd probably be able to retire if it wasn't for you two. This is Alvaro. He's visiting from Baghdad for a couple months. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. We're going to one of the souks later if you want to join. Sure. Again with this conversation. I don't know. I mean, all the famous movie stars do it. You know, you get this pulled back. And then you get this clipped. You get the nose done. You might as well just change your face. Just pick a completely different one. And actually, I was hoping you'd pay for it as well. Yes. See? This is what it is. This is what it always comes down to. We're closing. But we're not done. Yes, you are. I got this. It's on me. Go. Yalla. Go. Are you all right? Not too bad! Run! Move. This is my song. Let me sleep! Zain? - Rafiq. - Zain. What's wrong? - Don't come in to work today. - Zain? What happened? Zain! What was the one thing I told you over the phone? What happened? Your brother was here. They found you. You need to leave. They know where you work. It's as if God is punishing me. I'm so sorry, Ghazal. You're not the problem here. You need to leave. Now. Where would I even go? I have nowhere to go. Jordan. Jordan? I don't know anyone in Jordan. I know how scary this is... but you're not safe here anymore. I don't want to... Don't be afraid. The UN can't protect you in your own country. So we need to get you over the border. Thank you. I'll see you in America. Please fill in the countries of your preference. Once you're there, you need to plead your case to the UN for asylum. Make them see there's no other option. Then just wait for your papers. It could take a long time... but don't stop refreshing that page. Enjoy it. If you need anything else, call me. Thanks, darling. Rafiq. Habibi. Grandma? Shit. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm such a muppet. Hey! I'm not done. Yes, you are. No more internet until you pay. I get paid end of the week. I'll get it to you then, I promise. Do I look like a charity? Do you think I run this shop out of the kindness of my heart? Internet costs money! I just need five more minutes. I'm almost done. You take your five, but you pay for ten at the end of the week! I'll give you the rest on Friday. You're good. Did you have a stroke? Your balance is cleared. You can thank your friend there. You didn't have to do that. I have money. I pay for my own. I didn't mean to offend. I just wanted to apologize for the mess I made at your restaurant. Yes. You come in and make a lot of trouble. Fine, fine. If you want, you can invite me to have a drink with you... any time. Does it hurt? Not now. Was it from work? No. My father. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. It's barbaric. No, he thought he was protecting me. Growing up, they tell us being gay, it means you go to hell. Not just you, but your mother also. When my father put my arm to the flame, he told me... "This is what it feels for five seconds." "Imagine eternity." Dear Rafiq. You'll never believe what I can see behind these hazel eyes. I'm living the American dream, baby. Since you've been gone, it's all happened so fast. I've been here for a few months waiting for a moment like this, and it's very different than I expected. In a good way, I think. You'll be next. I know it. Don't give up. And keep checking your status. Love, Miss Independent, AKA Zain. God is great! What is it? What's wrong with you? What happened? God bless you. Look, you're a sexy, beautiful man. Hey! Hey! You still have to pay! Do you know anybody in America? Yes. My best friend, Zain. He live here. Keep these with you always. I'd recommend putting them in plastic. They're no picnic to replace. Yalla. Wait one second. Wait. You look like my grandmother. She wishes. Girl, you look like you just fled your homeland. Take a shower. Come on. We're going out. Hey, baby. - ID. - Hey, Sean. - ID. - I don't have. Zain, where are you? Dude, you got to move. - Please. I come with Zain. - Next. Okay. You're good. Just one second. I... Come on, buddy. Hurry up! We've been waiting for, like, 20 minutes. These are my papers. See. This is me. Rafiq. I am Rafiq. I've no idea what this is. Okay. Habibi, why are you out here? - Come on. Let him in. - I'm sorry, no ID. Hold on. I have only my papers. Don't worry about it. Do you see a birthdate on this? - Yeah. - Is he over the age of 21? Girl. - Yeah. - Then he's in. Welcome, baby. Are you okay? All right. All right. All right. That was Ms. Kiara. Ms. Kiara going deep inside on the girls. I love it. I love it. Speaking of going deep inside, Mr. Alex, do you mind if I reach deep inside your vase? And, okay. One of my favorites. You know the one. All right. DJ Antwon, hit it. That's my song! This is my song! Hi, Dad. I'm safe. I'm okay. I hope you are, too. Rafiq.
