A hymn to humanity Love has gone People, are you worried? Hey Hey! Subservient People! WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?! WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?! WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?! WHAT'S UP, PEOPLE?! Are you worried? It's good to get some sun outside... every so often... What in the world... ...do I do now? FATHER Ryuk. Sidoh, why are you here? Hey, don't follow me! I want my notebook back. Yeah... I ﬁgured it'd be that... Well... to be honest, things have gotten complicated so I don't know where it is now... That's so irresponsible. You're still following me? Give me back my notebook! I don't know where it is... If you want it back, go look for it... Wammy's House wasn't simply an orphanage... it was an institution for brilliant children... to raise them to become the Second L... L's successor... '1 is successors... ” The one who ranked at the top was a boy called Near. Near... N... Huh? And the boy N mentioned, Mello, was ranked next after Near. Near is L's successor... There's no mistake... N is commanding the SPK... No... Mello probably wanted to become L's successor... If that's the case, Mello would probably want to use any means necessary to get the notebook before Near... Near is convinced that Mello is involved. He's certain that he is... These are sketches of both of them. There are no photographs of them. L's successor... I'm still... ﬁghting L... At any rate, I have to ﬁgure out where Mello and his Maﬁa associates are located... I've already had Misa check a list of wanted Maﬁa members with her Shinigami eyes... Oh! There he is! Someone whose name I can't see! Number 105! His name is listed as Jack Neylon, but... His real name is Kal Snyder! With the Death Note, I made Snyder send a letter to tell me where his hideout is... It should be coming soon! Light! You've got a letter... He is in Los Angeles! I did it! I've completely surpassed both of them! I'm deﬁnitely the strongest as long as I have the Death Note and Misa's eyes! Light, I've been a big help, haven't I? Yeah, I love you, Misa. The only thing I have to do is see how far I can control people. I'd like everyone to see me... so I can talk to them. The owner is Snyder... I guess I have to make him touch the notebook... Oh, well... Wheee... plop. What the hell? The notebook moved on its own... It's a notebook that can kill people. I wouldn't be surprised if it were alive! B- Boss! The guy with the dirty clothes... Is he new? I'm not a new guy, I'm a Shinigami... Shinigami? If you want others to see me, you have to make them touch the notebook. He says you can see him if you touch the notebook... Everyone, touch it! There's nothing wrong with me! Fine... Everyone... Touch the notebook. - Woah! - What's this?! - I couldn't see him before. - Boss! Shall I kill him?! It's no use. Humans can't kill me. Seems this Shinigami's real. And it looks like he's telling the truth. Ryuk. Right now I'm going to relinquish ownership of this notebook. Follow the person who I give it to. What's this? You're relinquishing your ownership? Won't you lose your memory if you do that? Misa, lend me your notebook. If I do this, I won't lose my memory even if I relinquish my ownership. I'll give you as many pages as you need. From now on, you shall be Kira. Can you do that? That's fine, but... what are you going to do? I'll explain that right now... Mistakes will not be allowed. Chocolate is... good... Hey! So is what you just said true?! "If the person using the note fails to consecutively write names of people to be killed within 13 days of each other, then the user will die. " "if you make this note unusable by tearing it up or burning it, all the humans who have touched the note till then will die. " These two rules were made up?! Yeah. Those are definitely fake. A Shinigami probably wrote that as a joke before giving it to a human. We can disprove the thirteen-day rule by using a single person... The problem is whether this notebook had passed through Kira's hands or not... If it has, whether Kira know these rules were fake or not... If Kira knows, then they could be used to his advantage... Especially the thirteen-day rule which lets anyone prove they're innocent. Sidoh, keep guard outside. You can't be seen by humans, so at least you're useful for something... Keep watch outside. Got it? What's with this guy? He's scaly for a human... This is Yagami. This is Kira. What did you say? Kira? The notebook that the Japanese task force had in its possession was stolen by criminals, wasn't it? Do you have any proof that you're Kira?! Proof? Now that the notebook has been passed, there's no way I can prove that I'm Kira by predicting killings. But you'll receive proof that I am Kira soon. It's my notebook. What is the meaning of this? The notebook I'm giving you allows me to know a person's name by seeing their face... Got that? Calm down... and... listen to... me... On November 10, at 23:59, E very maﬁa member that I have gathered information on from the FBI and other organizations will die. I've already written it in my notebook, so it cannot be changed. I also know where their hideout is. I shall send that information along with the notebook... In other words... On November 10, at 23:59... This moment is your best chance... to get the notebook back. What should we do? If the members of the mafia are going to die on the day that Kira specified, there would be an opportunity. I resent the idea of following Kira's plan, but it's a good plan. That's right. But it doesn't... do us any good just by knowing when the mafia are doing to die. Mr. Ide, you know the answer. We'll have the Shinigami follow us... W- We do the eye deal and kill them for sure... I'll do the deal. N- No way! I'll do the deal... I handed over the notebook to begin with. Because of that, I even thought of killing myself... I'll use the notebook to kill the criminals... And after thirteen days, I'll die too... If Dad ever writes a name in the notebook... When that happens... NOVEMBER 10, 23:47 Is everyone ready? We're ready. Then... Deputy Director Yagami... It's time to make the eye deal with the Shinigami... Ryuk, please. I understand... Deputy Director Yagami, take a look at the photographs of the criminals I gave you. Can you see their names and life-spans? Yeah... | can... Your signal to go is when their names disappear. We're going in! I knew it, Kira was involved... I never thought he'd go this far... My perfect plan isn't ready... Damn! What is Sidoh doing? Just be quiet and watch, Sidoh! You'll get your notebook as long as you don't interfere. Roy! Skyer! The notebook is under Rod! Bring it up to the monitor room! Don't move! L, we've captured two of them. We've also safely retrieved the notebook! We're going back now! No, not yet. We still haven't found anyone who resembles Mello. He's hiding somewhere in the building. We've come this far. Use caution, and hunt him down. - What's was that? - An explosion? Don't move. I've just blown up the two entrances. But that was only a warning. Next, I'll blow up the entire building... Do what I say... It's Mello! Yagami again, huh? Maybe I should have killed you? I never thought I would be bargaining for the notebook with you again. M- I-H-A-E-L - K-E-E-H-L... Your real name is... Mihael Keehl. Damn if! How did he-.7 I did it! Give up, Mello. I won't kill you if you surrender. What? Why are you being stupid? Hurry! Write his name in the notebook and kill him! You'll die if I write your name in this notebook. Throw down the detonator and raise your hands! - Yagami... - Don't move! I only have to write your last name! It won't take a second. You idiot... Just write it. Write it! Sorry... I really didn't want to kill you... Yagami, you've... never killed anyone before, have you? Gun shots?! Deputy Director! Jose! Grab the notebook! Damn... This guy... He won't let go of the notebook! Why... you! Deputy Director! This is it, Mello! Hands in the air now! Matsuda, are you okay? I don't think so... He's okay... L, I don't see any sign of Mello! W- What? Damn it. He got away?! That's why I told my him to kill him quickly... Dad, Dad! Please, don't die! Light... Dad! I'm so glad... Yeah, I'm glad too, Dad. Light... I still have the Shinigami eyes. According to that Shinigami, Ryuk, I can't see the lifespans of those who own the notebook... Light... You're not Kira... I'm really... glad... Of course. You were still worried about that? Dad, don't say anything unnecessary. That's important, but there's something even more important right now. He has to write Mello's name in the notebook... S- Sorry... In the end, |... | couldn't kill him... It might not be good to say that "it's not too late, " here... No, it depends on how I do it... At a time like this... I can be distraught to a certain extent... Dad! Write his name! Write his name with the last of your strength! You can't just let him beat you! Dad! Light... I'm sorry... Dad! Dad! Dad! Don't you die! You idiot! You're the Shinigami who came to take back this notebook, right? Yes. Even if it benefits the Kira investigation, we only need one of these notebooks... I'll give it back to you. Those who use the notebook are cursed with misfortune, huh? Well, it's not as if Soichiro actually used the notebook. He died believing that his son isn't Kira. So I guess he was happy... TO BE CONTINUED This single page Forever depressing A ﬂeeting tactic in the eyes Without petition evil against the law chain it in prison Poison the notebook fear the lust Delusion of being deceived perpetually drooling Judgement is "crime control" they drive/ed Who has the Rx for that?
