   Shinigami never use it that way,
so I can't say for sure, but...
 In theory, any time before
their natural deaths should be all right.
 I can't count on you, can l?
 You can't.
 Yes.
 Yes, please wait one moment.
 Ryuzaki.
 Ukita at the NPA has received
a phone call he's concerned about.
 Then have him give the telephone
number of number five
 and have the informant call that number.
 Matsuda, you can turn on your cell phone.
 No, please turn it on.
 Oh, yes.
 Yes, this is Suzuki, head of the Public
Information division.
 Raye Penber's fiancée?
 Naomi Misora...
I've heard that name somewhere...
 It's her...from the Los Angeles
BB murder case...
 So that's it... She worked under me on
that case and now she's in Japan.
 She's been missing
since the death of her fiancé.
 Anyone would be depressed
over the death of a fiancé...
 Could it be...
 ...suicide?
 No, the Naomi Misora I knew was
very strong-willed, an excellent FBI agent.
 She would likely be thinking
of catching Kira.
 She was with Penber.
 She might have found a clue...
 If that's the case,
did Kira get to her first?
 Everyone, from now on,
we'll focus our investigation
 on the people Raye Penber
was investigating while in Japan.
 He was investigating two people
 in relation to the police
and the people around them.
 Who are they? Who are those two?
 Deputy Director General Kitamura
and his family, and...
 Detective Superintendent Yagami
and his family.
 Wha-?!
 I also wish to place wiretaps and
surveillance cameras in both households.
 I have to make sure this computer
is clean enough if anyone examines it.
 I just have to hide a
clipping of the Death Note in here...
 You sure are skillful
with your hands.
 You're popular with the girls, aren't you?
 That has nothing to do with skill.
It's more about looks than skill.
 Ryuk, you aren't popular are you?
 Surveillance cameras? Ryuzaki!
