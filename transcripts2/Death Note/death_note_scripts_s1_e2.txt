   What's wrong?
Why don't you say something?
 U-Unbelievable.
 I had to check to be sure.
 Who would have thought
you could have done this?
 Kira, it seems you can kill people
without direct contact.
 I couldn't believe it before
seeing it with my own eyes.
 Listen to me, Kira.
 If you just killed the man on-screen,
Lind L. Tailor,
 you just killed a man who was
scheduled to be executed today.
 It wasn't me.
 What?!
 This criminal is someone who
the police caught secretly.
 His capture wasn't broadcast
on television or the internet.
 It seems that even you
couldn't get information on him.
 He got you.
 But I, L... do exist!
 So come on!
Try and kill me!
 Why that...!
 - What's wrong? Do it quickly!
- What's going on?! This is unreal!
 - C'mon! Kill me!
- Are you trying to die, L?!
 - What's going on?
- It's Kira versus L!
 It's a live murder!
 - Come on, Kira!
- This is scary!
 Try and kill me!
 What's the matter? Can't you do it?!
 It seems that you can't kill me.
 So, there are some people
that you can't kill.
 You've given me a good clue.
 I'll tell you something good in return.
 I told you that this is
a live broadcast worldwide, but...
 This is only being broadcast
in the Kanto region of Japan.
 I was planning on broadcasting this
in different areas at different times,
 but it seems that I no longer need to.
 Now I know that you are based
in the Kanto region.
