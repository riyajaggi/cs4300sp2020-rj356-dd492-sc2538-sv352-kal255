 Previously on "Magic City"... You know they killed Myrnna because they thought she was you. You're next. Leave Miami now. I'll be fine, Ike. No, you won't be. The Miramar Playa minority ownership is hidden behind the thickest web of companies this firm has ever seen. What or who exactly are you hiding, sir? Pierce Fuller, Double Check Corporation.

 I think I love her. I said I love her. You're gonna die with her. You're gonna fucking die with her. I'll take my fucking chances. There are no chances, Stevie. There's no odds. There's no escape. If Ben Diamond sees these, he's gonna find you, cut you in half with a fucking handsaw and stuff you in an oil drum on Biscayne Bay. Where did you get these? Came with this. Fuck. Look what you did. You brought that maniac into our house. I'm so sick of cleaning up after you. What the fuck are you talking about? While you're out playing Joe College on Dad's dime, guess who's right here? - Who fixes the card game... - You? ...hires the hookers, pays off the cops? You chose this life. You chose this life! - You fucking bitch! - You chose this fucking life! - You chose this life. - Get the fuck away from me. You know, you and Dad are... Are what? You're not me. I hope she was worth it. I fucking hope she was worth it. ls Mercedes? You fucking kid! So, young Jimmy Shoes, what brings you down to our fair burg? Any bits of Judi Silver? Not yet. Maybe she's not down there. Keep looking. If he came down to kill her, who the hell did him? Call Sid Raskin, tell him to get his client down here. Evans won't want to come down here. Just get him. Thank you, Doug. - From Szechwan, huh? - Yes. Diamond residence. Hey, Dougula, how goes the crime-fighting? Yeah, yeah. These are all from the same region? - All Szechwan. - Okay. lt sounds promising. Sure. Hey, we'll knock a little off your vig for that. Go catch some bad guys. Guess who's visiting Klein's dog-and-pony show in the hangar. - Ike Evans. - They find anything yet? The shit's been underwater forever. No prints, no whore... nothing. They're working on Shoes now. Ike, Ike. He won't say nothing, Benny. Normally I'd say not a chance, but I sense something... a crack in the Evans' facade. So maybe Ike spent your 100 Gs, huh? We'll find out on Friday, won't we? I'll take this in a deep wine. I need some operating cash to bridge me until fall and I'm willing to sell some of my shares to get it... sell them to you. To me? What do you want, Ike? Half a million in cash for 15% of my majority stake. Why me? You can afford it. You do love that beach. Why not you? I have no interest in buying my way back into your lives. Trust me, you get to know us... you will pay big money to get out of our lives. Leave the terms here. I'll talk to my lawyers. No promises. lt just has to happen soon though, okay? - Are you in trouble, Ike? - I am in business, Meg. I spent some very scary nights in this room. I sat right there and asked your father for Molly's hand in marriage. How did that go? "Dudley, get me my gun." Well, you made progress. You're leaving unscathed. Take care, cabana boy. Then pack your bags, 'cause unless you yourself pitch Garry in his goddamn office on 57th Street, this deal ain't gonna close. Forget it. I can't leave now. It's not gonna happen. Then neither is Garry Moore. Kiss it goodbye. I've got it. Thanks, V. Better than Wolfie's. More coffee? Hon, will you try Stevie's room again, the Atlantis? - He's supposed to be here right now. - Sure. Fucking kid. Stevie tells me we're losing "Extravaganza Latina." Castro won't let the girls travel. - I love those girls. - Everybody does. They're a Miramar Playa institution. They're here every spring. We'll figure it out, Ike. We need something in that room. Who's Stevie got behind them? I'm calling. I'm calling. v? Tell me about the first time you saw me. What's wrong? ls something wrong? Just tell me, okay? In Havana? lt was spring of '54. I was there with Vic and a few other guys. So we're sitting there at the Tropicana. I was bored. Then the lights went down. I looked up and there you were, your eyes like... like the ocean. And I knew. I saw it all. You... you were wearing a black leotard, with those crazy long legs. God, how you moved, how you... how you danced. I'm not that girl anymore. I lost her. I'm not having a baby. That's... that's okay. It's all right. We... we can, you know, stop trying, forget about it. lt will happen. lt won't happen. I can't. I... You don't know that. I do. I do know. That's what I'm saying to you. What do we do now? We love each other. Come on. Let's go back to bed. Everything is gonna be okay. I promise. Amazing. I do the top hand, right? With my fingers like this? - No. - No. How am I swimming? Picking berries out of a basket. Dan the man. Okay. We've been all through these, kid. - Any criminal records? - Nothing relevant. DUI, trespassing. Monte the valet... he got caught pissing in Neroni Plaza lobby, public intoxication. Well, at least it wasn't in our lobby. - Motive? - You gotta go... you gotta go. All right, for our own guys to hit us, besides the money there's nothing I can see. Your pop's good to his people. There's no apparent grudges. We checked every fence and pawnshop in town. This guy's either sitting on the loot or he's dumping it somewhere else. This fool's either crazy or very desperate or just plain stupid. Why? Everybody knows the Butcher keeps a cabana here. He likes to keep it quiet for his game. You just don't mess with Ben Diamond's business. Climbing all over a 14-story hotel in the dark... we're looking for an athlete. I couldn't do that. Who the hell could? A spider monkey? What? - Thanks. - Anytime. Somebody loves you. They made you a nice lunch. My daughter. Mercedes, right? You said you had news. We have a boat and a guide in place. She'll be home to you very soon. Good, right? For sure. Mercedes will be... Let's just keep that between us for right now. The less people know about it, even Mercedes, the safer Maria will be. You understand. Sure. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'd love to have a drink with your boss, meet the famous Ike Evans. For Double Check Corporation? For free Cuba. Sure. Sure, okay. We're on the same side here, vic. Thank you. Mr. Fuller. Hmm? Will you get this to my wife... for her trip, you know? No promises. But I'll do my best. - ♪ Rockin' robin ♪ - ♪ Tweet, tweet, tweet ♪ - ♪ Rock, rock, rockin' robin ♪ - ♪ Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee ♪ ♪ Go rockin' robin ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight ♪ ♪ Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee ♪ ♪ Every little swallow, every chickadee... ♪ He's not fucking around. Can he make me come down there? Eventually, sure. But then it will be in handcuffs, my friend. I didn't do anything. Just be a mensch and go see the man. You're the king of charm. Work this asshole and let's get on with our lives. ♪ Tweet, tweedle-lee-dee... ♪ - You owe me one, Evans. - I know. - I gave him the files like you asked. - Can you shut my door, please? It's me. Hang on. Screw you. What's that smell? Marijuana. I'm under a lot of stress. You want some? Marijuana? Jesus, Stevie. I shouldn't even be in here. You don't have enough problems without jail time? Can we possibly be related? What do you want? I think I know who's blackmailing you. Divin' Dave. Really? The robberies started when he showed up. He's practically a gymnast. Climbing up the balconies would be nothing for him. And look, he's done it before. A friend at the DA's gave me his records. Three arrests but no convictions, which is why there's nothing on his employee background check. For breaking and entering, you know, second story. Atlantic City, San Diego and Fort Myers. Wow. Danny, this is amazing. This is great. You saved my life. We should let the cops handle it now. No. No, we shouldn't. Ben owns half the force. He'd have these pictures by dinner. Stevie, we should go to Dad with all of this. - He'll deal with Dave. Dad will know... - Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop. Look, it's my fucking life, okay? Now, thank you for this. It's a theory. You know, Dave's just a suspect. - I don't know if... - Little brother, I won't do anything until I talk to you first. Just let me have a minute to think about all this, okay? No cops, no Dad, please. But... I promise. Okay. Why do it? I get that she's beautiful and all that... you know, the sex and all. But she's Ben Diamond's wife. You know I'm afraid of heights? I can't even look over the balcony at Pop's. See, the truth is it isn't really fear. It's different, weirder. It's like excitement. I get near the edge; I look down at the pavement; and I can feel the butterflies in my stomach. I mean, I actually have to take a step back. Even though I know it will kill me... I still fight the pull to, you know, jump. Yeah, well, this time, you took us all with you. He's here. Go get him now. Ike Evans. Mr. Evans, welcome. What can I do for you? Why am I here? There's no smoking inside. Yeah, I'm pretty sure no one here is gonna complain. The open corpses release methane gas. And then there are the chemicals we use to lift fingerprints off these cars. You can lift fingerprints even if they've been underwater? How did you know they'd been underwater? Oh, I don't know, Jack. Rust... that's what tipped me off. I could be wrong. I'm just a hotel guy. Are you squeamish, Ike? Palmetto bugs creep me out. Otherwise I'm okay. Okay, good. Jimmy "Shoes" Clayton, a hit man for the Minneapolis mob. Do you recognize him? Should I? He was last seen 10 days ago driving away from the Miramar Playa with Judi Silver drunk in the backseat. Now Shoes is lying here with mashed potatoes for brains and Judi has disappeared. My guess is you hope she stays disappeared. That's what you're good at, Jack... guessing. Seven bodies. Look around, please. Seven poor bastards who worked with or for Ben Diamond. Dental records indicate this lump of shit was Kenny Segal. He crossed the Butcher in that Cuban cocaine deal in '54. This thing, we think, might be Albert Rosen. He had a metal plate in his head from the Pacific. Al was Ben's late partner in DNR Meatpacking. Ben's partners don't seem to last too long. You know where we found them all? Nope. In the middle of the Glades, tied to those cars at the bottom of the limestone quarry that you own. That's where the limestone for your beautiful lobby came from. You dug the hole and the Butcher filled it. lt is efficient. And that's it? That's what you got? Really? That's why you yanked me down here? Look, if you say that I own it on paper, I guess it's true. Hell, I'm sure there's probably some bicycle wheels and an old Zenith Tv in that hole I don't know about. You see, that's what people do, Jack, in the Glades. They dump shit. Witnesses put Shoes with Judi Silver leaving your hotel. And they put you leaving right after them in an awful hurry. And we find Shoes dead in your quarry. lt won't convict you yet, but makes for a good story in your favorite hometown newspaper. Then you fucking tell it. And then grab your nuts, Dick Tracy, 'cause I will fucking own them. You'd better hope Ben doesn't find out you dropped by to visit the DA. Looks like he doesn't handle bad news very well. And I would pray he finds Judi Silver before I do. She'll put you at that quarry, won't she? Ike, you are between a rock and a hard place... the State of Florida and Ben Diamond. If you are connected to any of this business here, I promise I will find out and I will crush you with a legal shithammer. And if I don't get you, the Butcher will. Think about what I'm saying to you and call me. I wouldn't wait very long. So your advice is no. A firm, unequivocal, thunderous no. Poor Isaac. I'll have Mark send him a... No. Let me tell him myself. I owe him that much. It's late. I know. I'm sorry. I'm almost done. So people come and sit in this chair and try to sell you things? All day long. Can I try? v, it's been a very long day. I will be up in a few minutes. You lost "Extravaganza Latina" and you need something to replace it. You know I danced with them in the 1950 season in Havana? I know. When I was at the Trop, we thought those girls were a joke. Let me put something together to replace them. No. V, I very much appreciate what you're trying to do... Why are you being condescending to me? I know what I'm talking about. I... I was the best dancer at the best, most famous club in Havana, maybe the world. - And I'm offering you my... - What? What are you offering me? Your ass in a G-string? No. You are my wife. You are the queen of the Miramar Playa. You do not dance anymore. Cesar Ramos is a genius. He's a genius. He created that show when you first saw me, when you first fell in love with me at the Tropicana. And he's here now, in Miami. Please let me ask him to make something great for us, for you. I am asking you not to do that. Please, not right now. Now is not the time. I need to dig out from some things. Maybe later. Please. For me. Okay. Thank you. I will be right up, okay? Hey. Stevie. What's going on? Open the door. So what brings you to my...? I want those pictures. I'm sorry, what pictures? Now. Fuck off. Give me the negatives, the Polaroids. Or what, huh? Or fucking what, faggot? You're gonna kill me? You're not a killer. Unfortunately for you, the Butcher sure is. 20 large, 48 hours. I'll give you everything I have. How do I know there aren't any copies? You don't. It's like life, Stevie. There are no guarantees. Here's the deal: you give me my 20 grand and Janice and I are off to LA, gone. Hey, babe, pay me or kill me. A drink for the road? I hate to beat this to death, but are you absolutely sure? I never forget a friend, son. No. Ike never gave me one red cent from you. Always a chance to rectify that situation, though. ♪ Here is where you belong ♪ ♪ Everything seems ♪ ♪ So right when you're near ♪ ♪ When you're away ♪ ♪ It's all wrong... ♪ You like what you see? He knows. No. No, he doesn't. He won't. What's happened? You have a right to know. That's why... Stevie, what has happened? The Polaroids. No. No, Stevie, no. You promised me. I know who has them. I'm gonna get them back. How? How? Do you have any idea what they'll do to you? Are they blackmailing you? Of course they are. We're dead. We are already fucking dead. Do you know what he's gonna do? He's gonna find us and he's gonna kill us. He's gonna kill us and it will be slow and ugly. He will enjoy it because that's what he does. Ben Diamond kills people. He kills people. Hey! - I have to go. - No. - It's gonna be okay. - Stevie, please. S... Yeah, can you get me Chicago? Lakeshore, 5-7-2-2-5. One moment, please. Cy. It's Lily. Look, I wouldn't call. I'm sorry to bother you, but... I'm being blackmailed. I'm afraid Ben... No, no. Cy, Cy, if he finds out, he'll kill me. I'm no use to you dead. - Ben? - You just missed him. They split a second ago. He's on his way to his car. Hey! Hey. What? I'm sorry. You... you asked... Take your time, kid. Take your time. I know who's been robbing the Miramar Playa. You told me to tell you when I found out, so I am. Good. Good. Dave Donahue, the diving act. Divin' Dave. Works here. - Are you sure of this? - Absolutely. He bragged about it. Fine. Tell vincent or the cops. He bragged that he hit the Butcher's joint and got away clean. Oh, did he now? Huh. All right, kid. You want us to talk to the clown? Let's go. Hi. Hi. Meg, right? Yes. You must be Lauren. I'm... I'm your Aunt Meg. You probably don't remember me. I remember you. You look like my mom. Your mother was Meg's younger sister. ls that the new doll everyone's talking about? I just got it for my birthday. - Hmm. - Barbie. I don't really play with dolls anymore. I don't know. These are pretty stylish. They come in white too. Are you looking for Ike? He's up those stairs in his office. Thank you. And thank you. I hope to see you both very soon. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Mr. E. Meg Bannock is here. Okay. Would you send her in, Flo, please? Go in. Wow, quite a place. The engine room. Coffee? Danish? Baked here. No, thank you. Your answer is no. I'm sorry. Why not? My advisors tell me it's a bad business. I'm sorry, Ike. Me too. I hope to see you sooner this time. It's been really good seeing you. I missed you, Meg. Please feel free to come by, use the beach, make drip castles with Lauren. Will do. Shit. Hello. Hey, Ike, I'd like you to join us for cocktails tonight. - No, Ben, tonight's not good. - My place, 10:00. ♪ Look for the silver lining ♪ ♪ Whenever a cloud appears ♪ ♪ In the blue ♪ ♪ Remember somewhere ♪ ♪ The sun is shining ♪ ♪ And so the right thing to do ♪ ♪ ls to make it shine for you... ♪ Ike, he'd like you to wait in his office. ♪ And gladness ♪ ♪ Will always banish ♪ ♪ Sadness and strife ♪ ♪ So always look for... ♪ I would like a drink. Yes, of course. Forgive me. Bel, get my partner a drink. You're a vodka martini man, aren't you? Dewar's, neat. Yes. Make that two. - A chocolate shake? - Idiot. Pabst. You're in a good mood. Oh, the universe takes away and the universe gives back. You stole them? I'm free. What did you do? You swore you'd tell me. What...? I paid him off. It's done. He took five grand... a bird in the hand, every cent I had in the world. You have everything? You have all the photos? I don't give a fuck what he told you. I gave him $65,000. He says you gave him 10 grand to vote against gambling. What? Gambling hurts me? Hurts my hotel? Shit, Ben, you said it yourself: I built the Miramar Playa to be a casino. The senator is a lush, a syphilitic old whoremonger. And I would wager that lying comes to him as naturally as breath, but for some reason... call it a gambler's instinct... I don't think he's the one lying here. I think you are. A cigarette? The pari-mutuals own his ass. They pay him more money than we ever could, and they always have. He takes money from them. He takes your money from me, and then he votes his pocketbook. We lose. - Well, then why give him my money? - It's his committee. I thought we had a shot. Now, I never thought he'd be crazy enough to take your money and then fucking lie about it. If I had... No! I gave you my money... you! He says, they say, he says, you say, he... bullshit! You, Isaac, you. You took my money and now you will give it back to me. - I don't have it. - Now! Go to... go to our hotel and get it. I just told you, Ben, I don't... Get it! Isaac, you and I have stared into the abyss together. You know that I simply cannot allow this to go unpunished. I can't. People will die tonight. That is a promise. Please be back with my money before then. What's wrong? It's the middle of the night. I need $100,000. I need it right now. You are the only person on earth... You're insane. I am in trouble... real trouble, Meg. Do you think I want to be here? What have you done? I will give you 10... 15% of my shares for $100,000. Those shares are worth at least 10 times as much. I'm sorry, but this is not how we do business... - in the middle of the night like two... - We? How we do business? Do you know why your father finally agreed to sell me the Bannock property? He insisted that I sign away my children's inheritance. What? And I did. I did. I signed away my children's future for the Miramar Playa. Our kids inherited nothing from Molly. That money all went back to the family, back to you. Molly agreed to this? She... she believed in me. She believed in my dream. I didn't know. I need your help and I am willing to pay you well for it. Please. Atlantis. Yeah. Yeah, hang on. - Hey, Al. - Yeah? It's for you. Thanks, kid. So? What, are you sure? Okey-doke. - Keep the change. - Thanks. It's your lucky day. Wait. Get him dressed. Let's get the fuck out of here. - All right? - All right, all right. Come on. On three? Yeah? Yeah.
