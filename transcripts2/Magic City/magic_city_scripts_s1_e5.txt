 Maybe I should sleep downstairs tonight. Would you like that? Call Myrnna. She'll take Judi's 6:00, huh? - I'd definitely lose the wig. - It's the bitch's trademark. - Judi Silver? - That's me, handsome. ( gunshot ) ( screams ) You killed the wrong girl last night. That's why God made extra bullets. ( theme music playing ) ( screaming ) Mike! Stop! No! ( panting ) ( gunshot )

 ( breathing heavily ) Honey? It's okay. Go back to sleep. - Anything wrong? - Nothing. I'll be right back. It's me. ( exhales ) Oh, God. You're okay. Dad? Dad? Have you seen Judi Silver? What? No. No, I was just... Where is she? Uh, right now? No, next Shavuot. Yes, now, Stevie. - Um, it's... - Thursday. Thursday. Right, she's... I think she had a date... a late date. - Here in the hotel? - The cabanas... cabana six. - Okay. - Dad, what the hell is going on? You go back to bed. I love you. I love you too. Go back to sleep. My dad. You didn't invite him in. Funny. I like Ike. Great. But I'm not the kind of girl you bring home to daddy. You know he's old-fashioned... you having a husband and all. Hey, Lily. What? It's late. He's not gonna stay out on his boat till dawn. Hey. Are you scared? Sometimes. Are you? All the time. Do you want to stop? We could... we could just walk away. It's not too late. lt isn't? See? It's magic. You just have to be patient. Friend of yours? What? - You know this asshole? - No. He's not bad-looking, though. ( man chuckles ) Fucking faggot. So what are you gonna do with these two? Well, what are you gonna do with these two? - Man: Jesus Christ. - Judi: Calm down. Judi, it's Ike. - Man: Jesus. - Donald. Ike, I'm kind of, you know, in the middle of something. I'm sorry. I need to talk to you now. Donald: He's your what? Judi: Donald, shut the fuck up. Be right out. Stay. - Shriners. - We gotta talk. Oh, should I get my cuffs? Have a seat. I want you to listen to me. All right? I want you to hear what I'm gonna say to you. You know they killed Myrnna because they thought she was you. Who did? That doesn't matter. lt does to me. She took your date. She was wearing a platinum wig. She got shot twice in the face. You're next, and soon. Judi, this is the truth. You have to get out of town, leave Miami now, tonight. Why would anyone want me dead? Ike? They must think that you saw something. - But I didn't. - They obviously don't care. They? You set me up with Mike. You put me in that hotel room. Who killed Mike? I don't know. Well, I do know who killed Myrnna. Some freak. Some... some, I don't know, religious nut who hates old hookers in shitty wigs. And that leaves me out. I'll be fine, Ike. No, you won't be. You warned me. Your conscience is clear. I'm a big girl. I like my chances. Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta untie a Shriner. We're still digging out from the pageant. Maybe financially, but the press was coast to coast. Financially is the fucking point, Solly. vic's right. Nobody paid. That month was a car wreck. We comp'd CBS, the girls... CBS wants to do "The Garry Moore Show" from the Triton next year. - Nightly? - Weekly. - At the Miramar all year? - Yep. - That's amazing. - Not to be a broken record, but will they pay actual money? Yeah, location fees, an overall licensing fee for us. We'll comp the 900 heads in Triton for their audience, try to make it midweek when it's quieter. And pre- and postshow spillover alone for "The Tragedy in the Atlantis" - will be crazy. - We don't need them during the season. Garry Moore means Jonathan Winters, George Gobel, Don Knotts. We'll be the most famous hotel in the country. Steve Allen did "The Tonight Show" from La Ronde Room last year. Find out what the Fontainebleau got. You guys work the numbers. We'll talk tomorrow. CBS wants a full presentation by next month. Let's go. - vic, can you stick around? - Yeah. - Lubow called. - I know. I can't hold off the bank another day. All right, tell him to come by at noon. You've got the monthly... all of it? Do it, Phil. Sit down, vic. What's going on? The Mendozas came up empty. I'm sorry, vic, I really am, but there's just... Castro's watching everybody right now. Now I have a meeting set up at the embassy. - They've always been real good... - It's okay. I think I have a way. Who? Friends of my cousin. You're in touch with Maria? Every Sunday. She's okay. She misses us, you know. She misses Mercy. I'm not gonna give up on this, Vic. I know. That's great news about Garry Moore. Yeah. We're gonna get her out. Thank you. I'm sorry, honey, we can't. You have Hebrew school today. Mom, you promised. ( sighs ) Look, I promised we'd go to Jordan Marsh before the party on Saturday. Friday. God, it's on Friday. Friday, right. Okay, if we can, we'll go tomorrow. I hate Hebrew school. Oh, but I love you. My real mother would have never made me go. Lauren. Come on, we'll be late for school. My own son got coldcocked by this asshole. And there haven't been any break-ins since. Find this guy, all right? You know how much it cost me to keep this shit out of the paper? - I'll get him. - No, our guests can get robbed on Broadway, all right? They don't need to come here and spend their fucking money on... - ( intercom buzzes ) - Flo: Jack Klein on one... Florida State's Attorney. I know who it is, Flo. Get this fucking guy. ( phone rings ) Hello. Mr. Evans, good afternoon, sir. What can I do for you? Well, first of all, I was curious about that "Miami Herald" article you set up for me... good kid, asked great questions. I haven't seen it in the paper. - How can I help you? - I guess it wasn't newsworthy. You know what is? The death of Myrnna Shapiro. We'd like to chat with you about that. Call my attorney. I'd rather cut off my own tongue than talk to Sid Raskin. I'd appreciate it if you'd come by, just a casual... And I'd appreciate it if you'd either subpoena me or let me go back to work. I'll be over at your office in an hour. Hope you can fit me in between Jack Jones and Pupi Campo. You know I was the best in the class? I believe you. Well, you want to see how it works? Not at all. Here, I'll show you. Lie down. I believe you. I do. On your back, Evans. If your father walks in now, you'll explain. Okay. This is what Pan Am taught us. - Close your eyes. - Okay. First you must check to see if the patient is conscious. Now get closer and feel for breathing. Gently tilt the head back and give two breaths, one second each. - Mercy. - Shh. I'm saving your life. I'm sorry. It's fine, really. I am sorry. I'm just... I think I'm going crazy. I mean, my mom's still gone and I'm leaving in a few months, so... I know. ( sighs ) Yeah. But... this... whatever this is, whatever we are, is serious to me. - Well, maybe we should just... - Slow down. So no more CPR? I'll go crazy. - I'll be back in a minute. - Yes, sir. ( intercom buzzes ) Flo: George Lubow is here. Thank you, Flo. Send him in. - George. - Ike. - Thank you for making the trip. - Sure. You know, Ike, if it was my call, I'd carry you for as long as I could. No, the bank's been great. Here's your $65,000 for the last month. - A check would have been fine. - Cash is better. Yeah, perfect. So how does Catherine feel about Jack Jones? Who? You tell her that you have a front table for Jack Jones' opening night. - Okay, I'll do that. - Good. - Ike, I appreciate it. - Straight home with that. - Yeah, I'll see you next month. - Yep. Jack Klein and three of his associates are outside. They would like to speak with you. Give me 10 seconds, then send Klein in by himself. Got it. Sorry, you just missed Pupi Campo. He loves your work. Oh, likewise. Please. Myrnna Shapiro left your bar with a john and was shot by what seems to be a pro a few hours later. Well, I was sorry to hear that. Are you aware that she was wearing a platinum wig? Sadly, Jack, I am not up on the latest in hooker hairdos. She was dressed as Judi Silver and, according to witnesses, was with Judi's date. She told the poor asshole she was Judi Silver. And then a professional hitman killed her. - I see. - Do you? Somebody wants Miss Silver dead. You have any idea who or why? No. As soon as I can convince a judge, I'm gonna get a subpoena and throw her ass back in a holding cell. And we're gonna sweat that bitch until she tells us why somebody tried to kill her. That's terrific. Why tell me? Because you're next. You're a hotel guy, Evans. You're not a killer. What the hell have you got yourself into here? I could ask you the same question. Mike Strauss was a friend since we were kids. And I'm not a hotel guy, Jack. I am the hotel guy. You make crazy charges, you screw up this botched case any worse than you already have, not only will I personally sue you for your entire tragic net worth, but if I'm not mistaken, it's an election year. I know a lot of voters. Do not be wrong, Jack. Do not be guilty. Get Stevie. - I want somebody watching Ike. - Done. - And pull the trigger on the kid. - Danny? Yeah, let's get him up to the office. Judi's in trouble. I know it. - I talked to her, but... - She's a ballbuster. For how long? That long. Tell her we'll help her out with a little something. - Guilt gelt? - Travel money. The DA's got a guy outside, worked for me in '47. I'll keep him busy. It's, uh... Klein. I'll talk to her. Fuck talk. You get her out of town. - Do it, Stevie, now. - Done. Not today, fellas. What's wrong? I'm tilted. Tilted... crazy, right? I'm tilted inside. I found out today. They said I probably won't ever have children. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. The Surfside ladies love it. I can already hear them... "The gypsy's dead inside. She can't have children." I wanted to... I wanted to have a baby with Ike. Do you remember when my mom used to get those really bad asthma attacks? Last winter? Well, you know what cured her? - Santeria. - voodoo? Yeah, this Babalawo down on Coral Way. No. That's crazy. No. No, thanks. I remember a few girls used to go in Havana. Rooster blood? Come on. Well, did it work? It's just too... Desperate? Yeah, maybe, but, I mean, what have you got to lose? ( rooster crows ) Forget it. Let's go. We're here. Just try it. - Come in with me? - I can't. It'll be okay. I'll be right here. This is ridiculous. Yeah, well, so's being tilted. - I came to... - Shh. ( speaks Spanish ) Girl: Stick out your tongue. ( rooster clucking loudly ) ( man humming a tune ) ( speaking Spanish ) Tonight is the full moon. Make love to your man. Keep his seed inside you all night. At dawn, rise and bathe naked. Let the salt water cover you. Let the rising sun warm you. Let Oshun and Yemaya do their work. You understand? ( rooster clucks loudly ) ( bones crack ) ( crows cawing ) There's no money, no glory, long hours. We lose more than we win. Doug: And that's just the fun part. So why the hell even bother? Because it's right. Jesus, a true believer. You were top of your graduating class at Tulane, top of your first-year law class. Your friend Ethan here says you're a star at UM Law. If you keep that up, you know what kind of money is waiting for you in corporate and criminal? I don't need money. - Congratulations. - What do you need, son? Well, it sounds stupid, but to matter. I want to make a difference. ( scoffs ) Yeah, I know. It's a joke, right? Well, I guess I am a believer. It's almost 1960, a new decade, a new day. Things are changing fast and I want to be a part of that change. Things changing in the Miramar? What do you mean? Your father owns the Miramar Playa, right? Owns it and built it. Well, back in the nasty old days like yesterday, I heard there was illegal prostitution and gambling there. Doug. Almost the entire Miami Beach Police Department works off-duty as Miramar Playa security. Five decorated vice detectives patrol the lobby. - Why don't you ask them? - Because I'm asking you. What, do you think these are victimless crimes? I think my father is the best man I know. And I'd stand him up against you or anybody else in this room. And you are obviously his son. We are in a fucking war here. People will die, have died protecting the dream, the promise of this paradise. We are... the men in this room... all true believers too. You are not alone. Here's what we'll do: you go home and you think about this. Think about if you really want to fight this fight with us. We'll do the same. I don't want to waste either of our time. If we decide to continue, you start as a summer intern like Ethan did. In three years, assuming you work out and after you pass the Bar, you will join us as an assistant state attorney. That day comes, I promise you, Danny, you will make a difference. - Pleasure. - Thanks. What do you think? I think we just got inside the Miramar Playa. Yeah, but if you do hear from her, Hazel, right, you call me, okay? I'm serious. There's 50 in it. I'm gonna check Lincoln Road. Maybe she's shopping. If you see... If Silver shows, I'll find you. ( phone rings ) Hello. Hi. What? Okay. Yeah, okay. I'll be there. Judi? - No. - What's her name? - Fuck you. - Got it. What's her last name? You know where the job at the DA's office leads to? To the poorhouse? ( chuckles ) The governor's mansion, man. Yeah, right. Governor Danny Evans, I'm telling you. I'll just be a summer intern. Things happen like that. Your old man... come on, when I first met Ike, Ike was a bouncer down at the Five O'clock Club. My dad, a bouncer? Yes, yes. Don't tell him you heard it here. ( both chuckle ) Oh, yeah, Ike had this move he used to do too. He used to keep his lead sap in his inside suit pocket. Some big dude causing trouble... Ike would say, "I will pay you to step away from the door. I will write you a check right now." Then he'd reach inside that suit pocket and wham with that sap. - The guy would fall like a tree. - That's fantastic. A couple years later, Ike Evans is the king of the Beach. The world spins fast, young man. Miramar Playa, Inc., purchased Lot 8 from the Bannock Family Trust in 1953, then mortgaged it back to the First Miami Federal for $1,653,000. Isaac Michael Evans then leased it to himself as Miramar Playa Hotel Corp for $200,000 a year. On August 24, 1953, Attorney Alden Rice, now deceased, traded his interest in Lots 1, 3 and 5 and half his interest in Lot 4 to a new corporation called Miramar Entertainment. Gentlemen, what's the point of this? Thank you, Burrows. That is precisely our question: what is the point? The Miramar Playa minority ownership is hidden behind the thickest web of companies, attorneys, living or dead, and shell corporations this firm has ever seen. What is the point? To put it more bluntly, what or who exactly are you hiding, sir? Did your due diligence tell you who owns the controlling interest of the Miramar Playa Hotel? You do. Right. And according to your due diligence, have I shown a profit every year since we've opened our doors? You have. ls the price I am suggesting to buy 49% of the greatest resort property on the East Coast a fair market value price by any estimate? On its face. Then I suggest you take that piece of paper and you shove it sideways up your wrinkled ass. You tell Meg you blew the deal. The Miramar Playa's off the table. Mr. Evans, wait, please. Don't you think Miss Bannock has the right to know who she's buying her share of the hotel from? No. Hitler could be holding the minority position. All Miss Bannock needs to know is that her $4 million buys her 49% of my hotel. Now she has the right to know that Ike Evans is her controlling partner and no one manages a hotel better than I do. She has the right to know that I always make my partners money. And finally, she has the right to know that you fucking zombies screwed this deal. That went well. Obviously, we do not advise you to proceed with this investment. Obviously. Do you agree? That you gentlemen are fucking zombies? No, of course not. Look, I like the Miramar Playa. I have a childhood attachment to the property. Ike does make money. If the rest worries you, then keep digging. Find out what you need to know. That's your job. I'll handle Ike. Honey, your face looks beautiful. ( laughs ) He's crazy. Hey, don't move. Don't move. Here we go. Maurice, darling. Maurice: Ah. Let's sit, sug. I'll be right there, okay? Hey, Al, you doing pedicures now? She won't let me touch her, so... Crazy girl's got a bladder like a thimble. Who? Ben's broad. Listen, baby, do me a favor. You go back there, you see a little brunette taking an endless whiz, you tell her Benny's waiting for her. Sure. Judi, hey. You know Lily Diamond, Ben's... Wife? No. Judi Silver. Oh, Silver, like your hair. Beautiful. Um, Al asked me to come get you. You husband's waiting. So... Jack Jones, opening night. You'll remember about those tickets? - Absolutely. - Six of us. - You got it. - Lovely to meet you. No, don't even think it. Even I'm not that crazy. He is. That's the Butcher's wife. Are you kidding me? He'd have my hide as a belt. She's beautiful. What? What do you want from me, Stevie? I want a favor. On my back or on my knees? Don't. Don't talk like that, all right? I care about you. I worry about you. You do? Yeah. Now Ike says you're in danger, - that you should go... - No. Forget it. I don't run. - He'll pay you to go. - For how long? - It'll never happen. I'm not leaving. - Judi. - V. - Out here. So beautiful. Incredible. Stop it. Never. You okay? Yeah, just today was a roller coaster. - What happened? - Nothing. You know, just life. But it's all right? Yeah, I think it will be. - And you? - Good. Lo is sleeping over at Jill's and I sent Gertrude home. It's just the two of us? Huh. So, Scrabble? Okay, yeah, you know what? Scrabble night can wait. You taste like champagne. - Do I? - You do. Let's see... â™ª My â™ª â™ª It's nice â™ª â™ª To simply sit â™ª â™ª And rest a while â™ª â™ª Now I know it's a shame â™ª â™ª I can't think of your name â™ª â™ª I remember your smile... â™ª What, you're a three-martini girl now? I am tonight, Mom. Mm. I have a proposition for you. I call in sick and you can take me upstairs and have me all night in all kinds of ways, baby. - Okay. - Okay? I've got one for you. You go upstairs and then you do the smart thing and go on vacation. Shh. My date's here. â™ª But it's simple and neat â™ª â™ª It's just right... â™ª - Are you all right, ma'am? - Ma'am? Oh, my God, marry me. Oh, I don't know. I don't know about that. But you are Judi Silver? Silver from top to bottom. Right, Stevie? - Can I get you a drink? - Aw, drinking's for pussies. - My guy... - Oh. Bill. Wild Bill here is all about fucking. I don't think this is a good idea. Come on. Jealous, baby? I'll do you both. I'll do the whole fucking room. ( men chattering ) I am the silver girl. Go away, Bill, huh? She's mine tonight. Okay, sure. No, no problem. No. No. I am not a sympathy fuck, okay? Okay, Stevie? I know who you want. I saw her. Fine. But you can't have me anymore. Sweet dreams, honey. â™ª It's just a memory â™ª â™ª I have â™ª â™ª One I almost forgot â™ª â™ª 'Cause the weather's so... â™ª Boom-boom, boom-boom. You have such a strong heart. lt used to be. You are killing me, woman. It's not a bad way to go. ( chuckles ) ( phone ringing ) Oh, no. v, no. I cannot make words. Royal chambers. Sure. Hold on. It's the prince. Shit. Where are you going? Somebody better be dying. - Stevie: I screwed up. - What are you talking about? Yeah, it's probably bullshit, but you got me all worried. Judi just left with a date. You let her go? When? Just now, a minute ago. What did he look like? Normal, like Dagwood. He blushed a lot. Nothing. He's a normal guy, except... Except what, Stevie? Well, he dressed like a schoolteacher, but he was wearing these really flashy two-toned shoes, - brown and white. - Alligator? - lt could have been... - ( hangs up ) Have you seen Judi? Just pulled out with a date. She was blind, man. - What kind of car? - '55 Bel Air hardtop, brown and white. Get my car, fast. Right away, sir. â™ª So good â™ª â™ª Take me by my hand â™ª â™ª And let's go strolling â™ª â™ª In wonderland â™ª â™ª Strolling â™ª â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª â™ª Strolling â™ª â™ª Baby, let's go strolling â™ª â™ª By the candy store... â™ª ( car approaching ) - ls she alive? - Who the fuck are you? I'm Ike Evans. Can we talk? Turn off your fucking lights. Look, I'm gonna get out of the car, all right? Don't shoot. You didn't answer my question. I'm Ike Evans. I own the Miramar Playa. Ben Diamond is my partner. I just want to make you an offer, if she's still alive. I don't do offers. You'll do this one. Can I get out of the car without you killing me? Yeah. Hurry up. Fucking mosquitoes. The state bird. Bill: God damn it. Ike: ls she alive? Yeah, yeah. What's Ben paying you? Enough. Stop there. I'll double it, all right? This girl is like family to me. She means a lot. I will pay you twice what Ben is paying you. And she will disappear. She will vanish. No one... not Ben, not anyone... will know she's not at the bottom of that quarry. And you... you're gonna get twice the money. - ( mosquito buzzes ) - Ow. Fuck. Ben paid me 10 Gs. I'll pay you 20. That's 30 grand. That'll buy you a lot of fine footwear. She goes away? She will go where no one ever sees her again. Look, I will write you a check right now for $20,000. You can trust me, all right? It's not gonna bounce. You know where I live. You can bring me back here and plant me. Can I just grab the checkbook out of my pocket? So you go by Jimmy Shoes? ( grunts ) ( starts engine ) ( phone ringing ) Hello. What? What do you mean, gone? Wake the fuck up. Call Izzy and have him find Shoes. What about the whore? If she's still breathing, you won't be. Change that as soon as you land in Santo Domingo. I'm sorry. Are you? Come on, Cuda, let's blow this pop stand. You got a Kool? How about a refill, Mr. E? That would be nice. I could ask Milt to shoot a little Dewar's in there for you. That would be even nicer.
