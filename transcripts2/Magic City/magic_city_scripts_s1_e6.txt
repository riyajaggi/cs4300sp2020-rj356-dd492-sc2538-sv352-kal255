 Previously on "Magic City"... You built a palace. Now it's time to be king. 100 grand. Work that Evans charm on those shit-kickers. You know this asshole? No. So what are you gonna do with these two? Somebody wants Miss Silver dead. You have any idea why? You have to get out of town, leave Miami tonight. I'll be fine, Ike.

 No, you won't be. lt ends now, Ben. Nobody else dies. You go by Jimmy Shoes? What do you mean, gone? If she's still breathing, you won't be. Damn it! She vanished? - We tried to serve her, but... - She stepped into a parallel dimension? - Judi was last seen... - No, just stop, okay? Stop. Check the trains, the airports, the turnpike. If this whore stays vanished, you'll join her. - You got it? - Yeah. Great. Doug.

 Doug, get in here. Go get a court order to drag that quarry in the Glades. The quarry? Where the last person that could hurt Ike Evans vanished. If you sweep that fucking thing like a goldfish bowl, you'll find Judi Silver. I'm good, Pop. Isaac, talk to me. I want to buy out my partner. I want to marry Ava Gardner. Exactly. If gambling hits, the money will be so huge, he'll never sell. They've been talking about legal gambling since before the Depression. lt could pass this time. Then you make sure it doesn't. You know, you can be very convincing when you want to be. Just stall, you know? Drag it along. Pretty soon your guy will take the easy money and leave the hotel business for fools like you. Thanks, Pop. You're welcome, kid. Can I have another? Can I have a buck? Oh, you son of a bitch. Hey. Lift it high, honey. The hands... look at the hands, boss. Sledgehammers. Hey, can he jazz it up a little? Hey, Stevie, why don't you get in there and mix it up with the champ? Absolutely, but, you know, I got this old football thing. Hey, Ray-Ray. Yeah? You've got fast hands. I've seen you palm tips. Get in the ring. - In the ring? Me? - 20 bucks, kid. He's not gonna hit you, for chrissakes. Argh. Put up your dukes. Move around, for chrissakes, come on. You got what you need, Peg? Now that is scary. Ah! Señor Valiente... Mr. and Mrs. Diamond. Not gonna be much of a match, I'm afraid. Anything can happen in the ring. Indeed. Indeed. It's nice to see you again, Ike. Honey, go admire that handsome mulatto. Beautiful, as always, Mrs. Diamond. Stevie. Why don't you take Mrs. Diamond over to a nice seat? - Kid. - Mr. Diamond. I'm not wearing any panties. Me neither. How's my 100 grand doing? Stacks of money, remember? I used it. Good. Good. How exactly? I gave $65,000 to Senator Sloat who chairs the gaming committee. The rest I spread between the Democratic and Republican members. And? And come the vote, we'll see what happens. When... the vote? Sometime this session. Session? By Easter recess, Ben... April. Sloat's all over it. We're good. Poker by Pesach. Gracias. - Hey. - Hi. Sure, no problem. It's from Ike. Wishing me luck on my luncheon. Jackie Kennedy here... it's incredible. We'll see. - I'll put these in the dining room? - Please. Thank you. So anything? Huh? What? Oh, no, not yet. It's too early, no? You're glowing. You're crazy. Say hi to Jackie. June. June Cohen. Mrs. Evans. - What are these? - Flowers. Thank you. What kind of flowers? Yellow roses. They go with the pale... What are Jackie's favorite flowers, huh... her very favorite flowers on earth? Forget it. Lilies. Lilies of the valley. White lilies of the valley. Get them, please. Why is there a chubby Jewish girl sobbing in our coffee shop? I lost my temper. I'm losing my mind. Well, she's scaring the guests. - I just want everything to be... - Perfect. Yes. Why? For who? Hey, have you ever had one of them magical Cuba Libres? It's 11:00 in the morning. Not when you drink one. That's the magic part. One sip, it's midnight in the Trop. Another time, thank you. Are you sure? Yeah, I'll need some magic later. Sabor. Stevie, wait. Oh, shit. - Who's that? - Nobody. I drove her daddy's car into Indian Creek last New Year's. Wow. How many magic Cuba Libres did that take? I gotta run. You don't have to impress these people. You're better than they are. Why? 'Cause you're an Evans. Stevie. - Janice, hey. You look great. - Listen, I need to talk to you. And I need to talk to you too, but I'm in a crazy hurry. I got a plumbing emergency. A pipe burst in the Mar vista. It's not about the goddamn car, Stevie. Listen to me. You're in serious trouble. And I feel awful about it, I do. But I'll call you at the same number, right? - No, don't. Stevie. - I will. I'll call you. I promise. I promise. A burst pipe. Sit them on opposite sides of the ring. How the hell do I know? Let's pretend you're the boss. It's NBC's broadcast, but CBS is talking to us about "The Garry Moore Show." Separate sides of the ring. NBC gets better seats. King Solomon. - Are we done here? - Mm-mm. Your wife's Jackie Kennedy lunch in 57 minutes. - What about it? - The senator's wife just canceled. - Jackie canceled? - A family matter. Christ. Does v know? Mm-mm. Do you want to tell her? Mm-mm. There is a tin lining. I only have seconds to live? They're sending Joan. Great. Joan who? Kennedy... Teddy's new wife, very cute, very blonde, very shiksa. It's not Jackie, God damn it. - Sloat? - Mm, vic told you. The old gas bag's down for the fight. Kill me now. Hello? What the hell are you doing? Stop. Al, stop. Talk to Ben. 42-to-one odds. Nobody's gonna bite on that... nobody. The chance is sure as sunrise. Well, then let's even the odds, shall we? What if word slipped out, leaked, trickled into the world that I was going heavy for the underdog? "Ben Diamond's betting it all on the long shot." Money would think Valiente's taking a fall, the fix is in. And? Then odds could swing... would swing in our favor. And at the last second we bet big on the champ and reap a sweet return. Go forth, Bel. - Ben. - Spread the good word. Your apes are trashing my room, going through all my things. Why are you so upset? You got something to hide? No. Jesus, Ben, this crazy Gestapo shit has got to stop. I'll have you know that some of my family, albeit distant relatives, were killed by the Nazis. - Robe. - Oh, please. You know what I mean. So what are you looking for? The truth. I'm a searcher. The truth? The truth is, I am your wife and I'm faithful to you. What about you? What about your whores tucked away all over town? - Hey, boss. - Yeah? Get in here. Sounds like my ape found a banana. Princess, after you. There's nothing I like better than watching two heroic gladiators... - Check this out. - ...meeting in the ring... a fair, competitive sporting event. Senator, you are still the strongest opposition in the state House to legalized gambling. The casino gambling bill is due to come up for a vote this session and... As long as I have breath, as long as my heart beats... The fine people of the State of Florida see fit to honor me by making me their voice in Tallahassee. I will fight the cancer of casino gambling and the plague and poison of organized crime - that we all know is a scourge... - Get my car. ...against the citizens of our great state. Nothing I like better than watching a spic and a nigger kicking the living shit out of each other, you know. I need to talk to you about the gambling bill coming up in the session. Craps and cards are an abomination unto the Lord, Ike... as is this ass. Oh, yes. I need to get off on nine, please. Sí, Mr. Ike. Would you make sure the senator can find the Gideon Bible in his suite? A fifth of JTS Brown and two glasses and a bucket of ice, okay, son? We'll see you in the Atlantis lounge Friday at 3:00? It'll only take a few minutes. That's all you're gonna get, son. So how do you do this? Oh, yes. Asshole. Damn it. Vera, it looks absolutely gorgeous. A luncheon in the coffee shop... such a cute idea. Thank you, Rachel. You're at table five at the end. Nice to see you too. Come here. Ike, I don't have time. Jackie... Isn't coming. I'm sorry, v. She's not coming. Not funny, Ike. Come on, not now. They called my office. They're sending Joan Kennedy instead. What? Who? Joan? Are you serious? No, no, no, no, this is not happening. - Please tell me this is not... - I'll go make an announcement. - What? - It's okay. They're gonna understand. You have Teddy Kennedy's beautiful new bride. It's gonna be fine. No. God, I'll... I'll do this. It's my event. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, this is nothing. You know, in the grand scheme of things, it's... this is meaningless, v. And yet it means something to me. How sad is that? Good morning, Ike. Al. So are you available for our friend? Always. Atlantis. Stevie? Hey, you. Please just tell me one more time you burned those pictures... those Polaroids of us. Yeah. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's his usual craziness, but Ben's actually really suspicious. But... but you're all right? Anybody alive in here? - I gotta go. I have to. - Stevie. Just us cave fish. Hey, kid, can you make a decent cup of coffee? Absolutely. Sure. How do you like it? Like I like my women... brunette, sweet. Speaking of which, who are you fucking these days? Me? I'm... I'm not... nobody, you know, special. Oh, don't be modest. Bel over here tells me that you're fucking a mother-daughter beauty pageant team. The daughter was Miss Belgium. The mother was a mistake. Ike. Belvin. Stevie, maybe you give them some privacy? You never listen to me. You never listen to me. I mean, look at that. Who wants to watch some fat kid pissing in a pool? You should get some mermaids. I've had girls swim in there. No, no, not girls... mermaids. - I'll look into it. - No, you won't, because you think you're smarter. You think you know best. No. Yes. And you are smart... smarter than most, but not everybody, Isaac. You're not smarter than everybody. What is it, Ben? I want my money. Remember the brown case? I want my 100,000 back. I told you already exactly where that money is. I gave it to the senator. And what happened to my gambling bill? I am not king of the earth, Ben, all right? I can't make them vote whatever... I want to meet him. I want to meet this redneck fuck. Even you can do that much. - Why? - Why? Because this shit-kicker's walking around with 65 Gs of my money. I think that entitles me to a drink. I can be very persuasive when the mood hits. Either I meet this man or you give me back my money, all of it. I'm getting this... this strange feeling... this strange feeling. ls there something you want to tell me, Isaac? The senator is going to Tallahassee after the fight. I'll bring him back after. Have him come back soon... very soon. Christ. ♪ Tears on my pillow ♪ ♪ Pain in my heart ♪ ♪ Caused by you ♪ ♪ Ooh... ♪ You fucking cunt. I saw you, you dumb bitch. I saw you with Evans. Yeah, you know him, you lying cunt. What did you do, hmm? What did you do? Nothing. He wouldn't talk to me. You know why? You know why? Because you're a fucking skank. If I see you with him again, I will cut your fucking head up. You hear me? Oh, if you weren't such a wild fuck, I would kill you right now. ♪ When you find the one you love... ♪ Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I won. See? He's not that tough, Lo. Yeah, he nearly killed Banana Nose. Felix Rodriguez, sí. Yeah, you hit him with the left and lifted him off the ground. I mean, he was levitating. Sí. He says he hits harder today. - This fight ain't gonna last long. - It's gonna be ugly. He says he's still beautiful. Yes. Your wife is Vera Cruz? From the Tropicana? Oh, we have enjoyed you onstage many times. Was. I was. I'm Vera Evans now. Lo? I have homework, Vera Cruz. A toast. To beautiful women, beautiful fighters and a big, beautiful game for the Miramar Playa. And beautiful Tv ratings. - Salud. - Salud. So what round does Harper go down in? The first round? I wanted to talk to you. About Jack Klein? You heard? A little something. Talk. He's offered me a job for the summer. I'd be an intern in the State Attorney's office. It's a career track position, incredibly prestigious and... And you turned him down, right? No. Well, I haven't decided. I'll tell you what: I will get you an internship with our guy. Sid Raskin over Jack Klein? Come on, Dad. Sid's got the biggest firm in town, Danny. The biggest what, billings? I always loved that ocean. When I was a kid, we would dive for sand dollars. We would get them, bleach them, sell them to the tourists. We'd take a raft way the hell out there, almost to the Gulf Stream, barely see land. And we'd dive down, grab the sand dollars. One day I was swimming up from the bottom and I looked out into that blue water and I saw a shark... a fucking monster, swimming at me from the distance, coming right at me. And I freeze, waiting to, I don't know, get torn apart. lt was nothing... a mirage. lt wasn't real. lt was something I had imagined out of my own fear. But every time I dove after that, that shark was there, waiting for me, swimming in the distance. So I... I stopped going in the water. I stopped swimming. What's your point? That I'm afraid of something? I'm not. You are afraid of all of this... the Miramar Playa, success. You are afraid of becoming me, and so you want to stop swimming in the deep water. You want to stay safe in your small pond. Small pond? The DA's office? That's not the small pond. What does an Assistant State's Attorney make, entry level? - It's not about the money. - Yes, it is. No, it's not. lt is always about money, Danny. There is love... real love... for your woman, love for your family, your blood. And then everything else in life is about money. Power is money. Fame is money. Happiness is... You don't believe that. Ben Diamond believes that, not you. Ben Diamond? Say what you're gonna say, Danny. Why does Ben have a cabana here? He likes the sun. And his card games? They're illegal, right... Bel Jaffe's sports book? Ben is a guest... a paying customer like everyone else. We are in the hospitality business, boy. lt is what we do. We cater to our guests' needs. Now do we occasionally bend the letter of the law for a gin rummy game, a dog race, a pretty girl? Absolutely. But I will not apologize for how I run my business, not to you, not to anyone, especially not to you. Are you judging me, Mr. Assistant DA? I'm not like you or Stevie. I've never been inside, or whatever, like you two. I'm... Your mother's son. ls that a bad thing? Not if you have a rich father. Well, then I guess I'm okay. You really should get back in the water. You've always known how to swim with sharks. Thanks for the brisket. The Cadillac is a fine automobile, but the '59 Imperial... now that is a work of art. I'm taking the Eldorado, bro. In your dreams, man. No, brother, tomorrow, after the fight. Listen, kid. Nah, fuck it. No. What, you know something? The Butcher went big on the Dog. Valiente is tanking? Nah. No way. And he put 30 large on the kid. I placed the fucking bet myself. It's a bad city, champ. You think I'd tip you $20 otherwise? Crazy sudden, Sleeping Beauty popped the question yesterday and we're out house-hunting today. - You're looking on the beach? - Bal Harbour. - Ay. - I know. We found a palace... huge and on the water. Johnny says that after the fight we'll be able to buy it for cash. Well, honey, you'd better keep your man, 'cause Maurice ain't saying dope, honey. I can't buy a fucking winner. You bet on the fight? Maybe. Yes or no? I bet some. The champ's 42-1. What's the point? He'll win. You'll get bupkes. Wait. You took the Dog. Are we playing cards or is this "Meet the Press"? Ben took Harper? Bel. Belvin. You in or you out? I'm out. - How about you? - Mm-hmm. ♪ For your love ♪ ♪ Oh, I would do anything... ♪ Hey, I'm naked in the bath with you and you fall asleep? Okay, yeah, but I was dreaming that I was naked in the bathtub with you and it was great. Something funny happened today while I was getting my pedicure. Oh, really? This sounds good. No, really. Do you remember that guy that works for Ben Diamond... the little one? Johnny T. Uh-huh. His girlfriend was getting her hair done and said they were getting married. Well, mazel tov. And she said he's getting her a huge Bal Harbour house right after the fight. Well, that's nice. Well, maybe he has some inside information about the fight. Or maybe his home loan came through. You're impossible. I do like this new color. Argh. What? It's not a new color. Ow. Let me make my campaign contribution right away. $10,000... my appreciation for your fine service, and particular your guaranteed "no" vote on casino gambling this session. My "no" vote? I'm sorry, but this old man is a bit confused. You do not want gambling? I distinctly remember the exact opposite conversation in here. It's not all about money, Senator. I realize that now. I have a beautiful 13-year-old daughter and I want her raised in a good Miami, a wholesome Miami. God bless you, Ike. And God bless the great State of Florida. Absolutely. You got a sec? Ben's fixed the fight. Valiente's taking a fall. Grady heard it from Dandy and Bel practically confirmed it in the cabana game. Go on. Al placed Ben's bet on Harper... $30,000. Belvin practically told Hash that he's betting on the underdog in front of me. Thanks. Thank you so much. You're welcome. As always, good to see you. - Good afternoon, ladies. - Hello. Uh-huh. Okay. All right. Sure. I heard you. Okay. - Fight day, my friend. - Are you busy? Picking up. What are the latest odds, Bel? 9-5, Valiente. We got us a horse race. From 42-1? Eh, some late money on the Harper kid. Go figure. I could probably kick the schwartz's ass. Funny, huh? Well, it's a funny old world. $25,000 on Harper. Big Ike going for the Dog? Really? Can you handle it? Hell yeah. Enjoy the fight. Absolutely. Isaac, it's a hell of a lot of money. How bad do you want me right now? You're crazy for it, right? Don't. Do not do this. Come on, tell me. You're driving me insane. Good. I should go. Okay. Okay. One of Stevie's fans? This is crazy. I'm leaving soon. I'm moving away. All this is... it's crazy. No. No, it's not. I think that... I know that it's right. I do. Sneaking around in your big brother's room? I'm not ashamed. I'm not. Then what? What are you? Yours. Excuse me, mister. You got the time? Yeah. How does that fit? Does that fit okay? Like a glove. So you're happy? Yes. Yes. Great. I'll take this back. Almost done. Me too, you know. That's perfect, 'cause... you know, what do you say I pick you up later, we hit the Dream Lounge? I meant Mrs. Diamond. Ah, of course. I have to go. No. Yes. I'll see you later. Yeah, but we'll be those other people... the ones that can't know each other. And I'll see you at the fight, wearing the dress he bought you, on his arm. I'll be there with him, but I'll have you all over me. Ben won't even notice I'm there. Impossible. He won't. He'll be too busy counting his money. He's gonna win big tonight. Yeah, right. He's taking Harper. No, Valiente the champ. No, Valiente is throwing the fight. He is? Well, Ben thinks he's winning. We're throwing a big party for him at our place afterwards. Shit. Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure Ben bet on Valiente? I was there. $30,000 on Orlando. - Fuck. - What? I gotta call Ike. Shh, shh, shh. Come here. What's wrong? Ben, he... fuck, I gotta warn my dad before Bel closes. Okay. Good luck. You too. Florence. Flo, it's Stevie. Get my dad. What? No. Shit, well, find him. Yeah, find him now. Tell him... tell him Ben went big on Valiente. Got that? He went for Valiente. The fight isn't fixed. Do it now. Dad. Ben fucked us all. He let it out that the fix was in so he'd get better odds, but it wasn't. He bet on Valiente? Huge. Shit. I checked with everybody. In the last hour the lines have been flooding in for the champ. And he's got bookies to take it on the side holds Line 733 Line 734 Line 735 Line 736 Line 737 Line 738 Line 739 Line 740 Line 741 Line 742 Line 743 Line 744 Line 745 Line 746 Line 747 Line 748 Line 749 Line 750 Line 751 Line 752 Line 753 Line 754 Line 755 Line 756 Line 757 Line 758 Line 759 Line 760 Line 761 Line 762 Line 763 Line 764 Line 765 Line 766 Line 767 Line 768 Line 769 Line 770 Line 771 Line 772 Line 773 Line 774 Line 775 Line 776 Line 777 Line 778 Line 779 Line 780 Line 781 Line 782 Line 783 Line 784 Line 785 Line 786 Line 787 Line 788 Line 789 Line 790 Line 791 Line 792 Line 793 Line 794 Line 795 Line 796 Line 797 Line 798
