 Previously on "Magic City"... - Ike is irrelevant. - Ike stays until the bill passes. Ike lives. If you were to give us some more grease for the legislative wheels, and... And you deliver the Senate vote. A mere formality at this point. Nicky fucking Grillo in my backyard. Fucking Sy knew! Fucking Sy knew, and I didn't? Damn it! I've been asked to work as an intern in the State Attorney's office. Klein?

 Maybe that's not such a hot idea. Then I picked up Bel's gun. I saw everything. So scary. I don't feel anything. What about V's show? The only thing that got their attention was when Vera offered to dance. You don't think I can do it, just say so. I don't think you can do it. I'm offering Sy a trade... the Miramar for Cuba. You con Castro, you fuck over the Chicago outfit, and you throw the Butcher out of your hotel. What could possibly go wrong? It's gonna work, Sid. I know it.

 - Her body is still in Cuba. - I can give you some names there. My wife is lying there alone. I will bring her back. I will. Gracias, señor. - ¿Su maleta, señora? - Yeah. The show's over. Story of my life. Rafael, ¿cómo está? More soldiers than tourists. If you like guns more than girls, welcome to heaven. I was just sitting here thinking about the very first time I saw Vera at the Trop. You stole our Vera Cruz. Rafael, what the hell's going on down here? Nothing good, not for us. They're killing us, literally, and, you know, the hotels. And who's in charge? Castro gave the casinos to an American to run... a mercenary, Frank Sturgis... but he's an idiota. He don't know shit. - I still want to meet him. - He's in the US with Fidel. But perhaps you could meet Pastorita Núñez... Frank's boss, big deal, right next to Fidel. She runs housing, some things for the Revolución. - Can you help me? - Well, what's the deal? What brings the great Ike Evans to Havana with no bags and a briefcase? You just keep that suit cleaned and pressed, my friend. You could be wearing it for me. Yiddy, cut him down. - You want him in Dumbfounding? - Nah, fuck it. Chum him. Chum him. Putz, you missed a spot. Enter. Good morning. I... Last night was a fucking disaster. I want Stevie back. I want you and Stevie together. Can you do that one simple thing for me? Tonight? No. Next fucking Shavuos. - Bel is here to see you. - Turn me up to 5. Towel me. Okay. Get Bel. Nicky's selling guns, lots of fucking guns. Hand me an ice cube. Pop it in my mouth. Remember a few months ago somebody boosted a few hundred M1s and grease guns, some mortars from the Fort Homer Armory in Tampa? Fucking Nicky Grillo. Huh. I can't believe it, in my town. Yeah. Grillo's selling guns to these spics who are looking to dump Castro. The shit's sitting in a warehouse in Hialeah till the deal closes. I had a chat with one of Nicky's drivers this morning. He spilled his guts. God, I'd love to kill that bearded prick Castro myself. I shall help liberate "the Pearl of the Antilles" and deliver our casinos back to Sy, calm that cranky old fuck down. Keep an eye on Grillo. Find out exactly when he plans to deliver those weapons. You got it. Oh, Belvin. Would you be so kind as to give me another ice cube? This is all World War Il vintage. Hey, we won. We will need more, many more guns. Get me a shopping list. I'll set you up. For now, we got the 120 M1s, the three cases of Tommy guns, all the.30-caliber ammo. Fuck it. I like you guys. I'll toss in the 15 mortars for the cause. We're looking at 20 grand, half now, half on delivery. Deal? No deal. I wouldn't attack Castro's sister with this shit. We want double the M1 order, and US Korean War issue, not this ancient crap. Get us the M1918A2 BARs, M3A1 grease guns, Thompson M1928A1 or Thompson M1A1, fully automatic, and 500 of them. You get that, then call us. Last year this hotel was at 70% occupancy. This year, since January, you're at 20%. Last year I could have been here only as a maid or a prostitute. These hotels were not for us, not for Cubans... only American gangsters and their pet Batista. You came here, had your sex, drank your rum and tried not to hit any real Cubans as you rushed off to the airport. 500 real Cubans work in this hotel, 498 at the Nacional, 700 at the Hilton. And that is nothing compared to the tens of thousands of jobs these hotels generate. But I look around and I see the millions that could be going to your people, wasted as soldiers are playing tag with farm animals. We're only money to you, Mr. Evans? Yes, you are. I am a businessman. Check me out, Madame Minister. I worked my way up from a busboy to owning the single greatest hotel in Miami. I am a hardworking... The American dream. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for the drink and the opportunity to... You know what this drink is called? Cuba libre. A free Cuba. White Cuban rum and American Coca-Cola. Our Cuban national drink was invented by you... Americans. Por Cuba libre. I will check you out, Señor Evans. These are crazy times. Maybe Cuba and America will collaborate again. I look forward to hearing from you. Good day, Señor Evans. So you're gonna want our people to do the thing? No. Put a man, somebody that we trust, outside of Grillo's warehouse 24 hours a day. When the deal goes down, he gives the word, you call Dougie. Let him and the DA have the bust. Keep us out of it. Ah, poor fucking Nicky. Oh, I'm sorry. I can come back. Oh, no, nonsense. Go about your business. Bel over here says that you're a real gunsel. Me? No. No. No, shooting a colored guy at a bolita parlor takes some steel. Saved my life. It just happened, that's all. Yeah, well, nine out of ten fellas... a shvug jams a gun in their face, and they freeze. Not you. Impressive. How long have you been doing this? I'm sorry, doing what? Bartending and whatnot. Oh, since high school. College was never really part of the Stevie Evans plan. And what is part of the Stevie Evans plan? I assume you'll want to take over from your father, become a king of the Miramar Playa. I don't know. Well, it's your plan, your dream. I guess. Sure. Ike is a young and vital man. That'll be in what, 20, 30 years? Whenever the time's right, I guess. "Whenever the time's right, I guess." You know what I think? I think the time is right now. Stop that with the booze and all that shit. Sit down. You ever played cards? Poker? Absolutely. You ever deal, run a game? Yeah, for years, for guests, you know? Run mine. One second, honey. Bel here's got a lot on his plate, what with the Sea Breeze book and all. What do you say, kid? I'll give you 10% of the pot. You bring in the players. Bel's got all the regulars. Deal. You know the drill. Run the game. And you'll... you'll clear, what? - A grand a week. - A grand a week. Hon, do you think Stevie can handle running my game? I don't really know Stevie that well, but... What does your heart tell you? My heart says he probably could. Fine. She's a witch. Ha! She says, it goes. Done. Start tonight. What, now? Okay. I should probably let my dad know. Eh, later. - Congrats, kid. - Take the cards. Deal. We should celebrate. Let's have drinks over at my place. Um, Stevie, join us after the game. Oh, shit. I can't. I'm taking the boat down to Islamorada... a fishing tournament. I'm going upstairs for a massage. I need some tip money, babe. Yes, of course you do. There you go. Gentlemen, let's start the game. Sí. A priest performed the requiem over her body before the cremation, as you requested. Thank you. You should know we didn't do this. Somebody did. Más rápido, Lalo. Vamos, coño. Vera, you have danced this. You're wearing lead shoes. Muévete, chica. Move, girl. Pace, pace. The drums are driving you. They're... they're carrying you. Pace, pace, pace. Más rápido. ¿Qué pasa, niña? Déjame ver. Damn it! Ah, es un cramp. Shit. Ah. Ooh. It's nothing. What? Everybody gets cramps, okay? - Six weeks. - I can do it, okay? Fine. Then do it. Lalo, toca la música. Lauren. Look what Auntie Meg got me. You're all sweaty. - Sorry. - That looked amazing. Well, not yet. But it will be. Cesar is the best. You girls bought out the store, huh? Oh, my God, I got a dress, two skirts... I didn't realize you were planning to buy all this for Lauren. Oh, well, my fault. She looked so cute in these. I guess I'm making up for lost time. Well, as a rule, we don't shower Lauren with this Miami Beach life. We try to keep her values. I wish you had told me. Why are you making her feel bad? Lauren, honey, Vera's right. I should have asked. Just go dance, Vera Cruz. Lauren. Lauren. I'm sorry. You're absolutely right. I have to go talk to her. Right. Of course. And, Meg... I'd like the bill from Saks for those clothes. I apologize for not considering your feelings in this, but it was my gift. Lauren is my niece. She was my sister's only daughter... Yes, she was your sister's daughter. But she's my daughter now. Well... good luck on your performance. A present for the wife? No. I got a guilt gift in my bag for my girlfriend. Havana, huh? Jack Ruby. Saw you at the Riv this morning. Ike Evans. I know who you are. My pal Louie McWillie runs the Trop down here. You know Mac, right? Not really, no. Seven and Seven, shug. Buy you a drink? I'm good. Thank you. - Because he's a Jewish prince. - And so am I. You know what I mean. Everything's handed to him. The kid isn't hungry. He won't fight for us. You're wrong. He will fight. He'll kill. Why do you think Danny's sitting out there? I mean, he knows I tried to throw his beloved father into the gas chamber. So why does he still want to work for me? Because he needs to know. - Know what? - The truth. The truth about his father. That is a powerful engine. This boy will search and dig and tear into Ike Evans' life, because he has to know. And he will take us inside with him. If... when Danny finally finds the truth out about his father, I will be standing right there beside him. - Cop or criminal? - Excuse me? If you're waiting out here, you're probably either a cop or a criminal. Ah. No, I'm a law student. You? - Sweetheart. - Daughter. - My oldest... Susie. - Danny Evans. I was at Miss Roberts' class on Flagler, thought I'd say hi. I'm so glad you did. I'll see you at home. - Bye. - Bye. - Good luck. - Thanks. After you. Susie goes to a vocal coach down the street. The girl sings like an angel, a beautiful voice. She did not get it from me. So... - you are back. - Yes, sir. I would like to intern in your office. Let's just address the elephant in the room, shall we? Ben Diamond has a cabana, runs book and plays high stakes poker in your hotel. How do I know that your loyalty will be to the law, to the State's Attorney's office, to justice rather than... Because I give you my word. But what would you do if you saw something illegal occur in your home, in the Miramar Playa, perhaps something involving your family? Where would your loyalties lie then? I don't know. Come with me. This is the Diamond district... Ben's stretch of Biscayne Boulevard. He owns every strip club, dive bar, every B-girl. Victimless crimes? Maybe. Except for the 37 homicides on Biscayne, 103 theft and burglary convictions, dozens of overdoses. Liberty Square, Pork & Beans Projects. Ben Diamond's cradle-to-early-grave misery machine. He hooks 'em on heroin as kids, turns out teenage hookers, ruins whole families with cheap dope and booze, sucks what little money they do earn into his bolita and numbers rackets, seduces, corrupts, destroys. Ben Diamond ruins these people. And he gets richer and richer. What would you do if you knew where the devil lived? If you knew that you could, in one fell swoop, root out so much of what is cruel and ugly and dark in your world... rid your home of the source of so much pain, if you could save so many of your neighbors from grief and harm and death... what would you do to destroy that kind of evil? Anything. Anything. Hello? Shh. Lo's in bed. Sorry. What's going on? Sexy, huh? Oh. Are you hurt? Just tired. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine with the show. Eh, screw the show. I'm worried about you. Eh, it's nothing. How was Havana? Well, I saw Rafael at the Riv. - Did he ask about me? - Come on. Of course he did, first thing. He was always a big fan. Ha. I am going to show you your biggest fan. What are you doing? I'm a professional. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. Ow. Oh. Ow. Oh. Ow. Cesar is being so mean to me. Hey... Here. - There? - Mm-hmm. You poor girl. I'm waiting for you. Hey, baby! Hey, hon. You need some directions, or can I help you with...? Hey, I know you. You're... you're Stevie's little brother, right? Younger brother. Danny. Well, now it's getting interesting. You looking for a room, love? Maybe another time. Could I talk to you for a few minutes? I'll pay you for your time. Sure. Slide over. I'll talk to you on three conditions: a real customer comes... I split. 20 bucks up front. And you give me a foot rub. A foot rub? These fucking heels are crippling me. You ever give a girl a foot rub before? - No. - You'll learn. Okay, 20 bucks. Thank you. Get in there, honey. Oh, yeah. That's nice. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, the night Jimmy Shoes died, my father just showed up? I mean, what was he doing out in the Everglades? - Ask him. - I'm asking you. Gotta go. Did my father do it? Did he kill him? Why? What the hell difference does it make? - What difference does it make? - He's your father. He's Ike Evans. He'd be a killer. There are worse things. Just ask your brother. You must look like your mom. She must have been beautiful. You'll be back. Fuck. Fuck. You got a second? Yeah. Florence is just fucking torturing me. Can I get a hug or what? Mercy told me you brought Maria back. Yeah. Yeah, I did. It was something, but... No, it means everything to them. You did a good thing. Well, Danny, they're family. I took Klein's job. I'm his intern this summer. - It's a huge feather in my cap. - That's not why you did it. No. Then why? I believe in it... in the law, in protecting the law. - You believe in Jack Klein? - Yes. Me too. I believe he is a self-serving hustler that would kill his own mother to get in the governor's mansion. Look, Danny, you have always seen the world as... What? Black and white? Good and evil? No, you're wrong. I see things as they are. I had to. I grew up here. I grew up in this world... your world. My world? I believe that we have a choice. - We choose... - What? What do we choose, Danny? - Good or evil, black or white? - No. Right or wrong. Then take the fucking job. Like I said, I already have. Flo! Mr. E? Who is that? Your decorator? Get Vincent now. Can I help you gentlemen? No, we're good. No, actually, you're not. I'm Ike Evans. Ike Evans, Ed Bloomberg. I know the name. They call me Eddie Blue. Sexier, right? Eddie Blue out of Vegas? And Havana, Tahoe, Monte Carlo, wherever there's a casino. - You see a casino here? - Not yet. Fellas, grab a Danish. I'll find you. Your investors think it's only a few months away. They're wrong. Chicago's feeling very good about the gambling bill passing. Hence the Blue man here, measuring your lobby for slots. Sy sent you? Ben Diamond. His plan is, the vote goes down this summer, early fall, the latest. We open for a killer holiday season. "We"? I guess I'm your new partner. Your brains and my looks, huh? I'll double your hotel profits first month... tail wagging the dog. Ben says you pre-wired the lobby for wheels, tables, slots. Yiddishe kop. I don't know what the fuck you're doing in my hotel, but I do know that you're gonna stop doing it right now. I'll tell you what: have your electrical engineer drop the as-built lobby wiring diagrams, blueprints up to my suite. Your suite? Ben told me to grab the Sinatra Suite. - I haven't checked in yet. - Yeah, you know what? Don't bother. We're at capacity. Why don't you go over to Eden Roc? You can use my name. See you later, partner. You need help? What's your name? Let's go. After you. I know he's a fucking casino guy, Sid. No, listen. That's my point. He's more. Eddie took over the Stardust last year... the whole hotel. The boys had him running Cal-Neva last winter... - the games and the hotel. - That's a comfort. You really think that Ben is moving Eddie in? Does day follow night? Eddie's clean. I had him checked. No arrests, nothing. That's how he fronts for the outfit. Ben and Sy... they're in the Vegas black book. Neither one of them could step foot into a casino. But Eddie Blue is kosher. My people in Tallahassee tell me it's down to the wire on the gambling thing. Your boy Sloat... he's muscling those cracker votes, Isaac. They could win this time. This vote could pass. You are a fucking fountain of good news today, Sidney. - That's why I'm here. - Good-bye, Sid. Vera Cruz. Oh, shut up. I'm sorry, we're all out of fountain of youth. A double cortadito. And keep 'em coming. Well, it looks like you could use something a little stronger. A triple? Maybe Dr. Bobby's B12. A shot? Amphetamine? No. No way. I tried that once at the Trop. No, thanks. No. No. It's not speed. It's vitamins. It's an enzyme thing, I think. It's his invention. It's healthy. I used it a couple of times during the season last year. Saved my life. Mm, I don't think so. Dr. Bobby goes up to Palm Beach and gives them to the Kennedys all the time. Jackie sends her driver for him. Eddie Blue? He doesn't know Miami, doesn't know Florida politics. I live it. He's here too soon. The vote hasn't happened yet, probably won't happen, Ben. We have an agreement, all right? I run the hotel. And you have. And you've run your kingdom for years. Did I ever interfere when I was in Havana? No, not once. Well, Havana's gone, and I'm here. Jesus! You still own the joint. Eddie's just a casino guy. One would think that you don't want gambling here. When it's legal, all right? We can't afford the expense and lost revenue of a massive lobby reconstruction, not until we know for sure. That's the bet I'm making... that gambling will pass. And when it does, we want to be the biggest, the best and the first fucking casino on the beach, or we're done! That's how it works. Darwin... Charles Darwin, natural selection. Ike, you have two choices... adapt or die. Are you still seeing our senator? Last night. So you're with him when he does his business, when he meets people? Anything you see or hear when you're with Sloat could be helpful to me, Theresa... names, dates, places. Anything that you can remember could help me. I need to know what you know. - Would that be okay? - Of course, Mr. Evans. I would do anything for you, whatever you need. Just be careful, okay? Gracias, Theresa. De nada, Mr. Evans. Dudley. Perfect timing. What's going on? What's going on is we are now presenting Lauren Cecilia Evans... daughter of Isaac Michael Evans and Mary Evangeline Bannock. Wow. Honey, you look... Wow. This is Mommy's dress. Meg pinned it. Stunning. We practiced the curtsy about a million times. It was worth it. You did it beautifully. You really did. Well, you should get upstairs and get changed. I'm sure your dad wants to get you home for dinner. Nothing like a kid to remind you how damn old you are. Speak for yourself. Time for a quick drink? You kidding? I just saw my future. I need a drink. - Thank you. - This 1926 Macallan was my dad's favorite. Perfect. - To Lauren. - To Lauren. Jesus. The old man knew his scotch. About all he knew. Oh, come on. He wasn't that bad. He just, you know, hated the Jews. And Negroes. And all Irish and the Catholics. Come on, what about the art museum? Okay, yes, he paid for that. He did spend some of what he inherited on good things, I guess. And he did help run the mob out of town in '46. Really? Oh, yes, he started the Secret Six. Secret Six? Never heard of that. Hence, "Secret." My father got the owners of "The Herald," "The News," of our biggest radio station, a few bankers... the six men who run Miami to join together and finally stop those gangsters. How? Every week, they'd put one of those rats on the front page of the paper... a big picture, give their names, addresses, what crimes they were committing here, every week, right there for the city to see. You know, I remember that. It worked. Sure did. So I guess there was some good my father did. What? Listen, the mob is behind this gambling bill. It will pass this time. Casino gambling hits the beach... we will lose Miami. We need the Secret Six again. They're all old men or gone. Who runs the city now? You. Your friends. You know these people. It is your time, Meg. People will listen to you, to us. Daddy, look what Aunt Meg gave me. Like Mommy's. You are killing me. The girl has very refined taste. Uh-huh, and I wonder which side of the family she gets that from. Say thank you to your Aunt Meg. - Aww. - Thank you. - I love you. - I love you too. I had a great time. It was so much fun. Bye. Think about it. All right, kiddo. - I loved her like a sister. - She loved you too. - Nunca la olvidaré. - Gracias, Alberto. How are you? I'll be okay. Thanks. Good. You want me to go back to the hotel and grab some more wine or rum or anything? Actually, they're going through rum like crazy here. Okay, well, I'll get a few bottles. Okay, thanks. Okay, well, I'll see you later. Buenas tardes. Buenas tardes. I'm Antonio Rivas. I'm a friend of your father's. I know who you are. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Pa' los santos. For Maria. Silencio, por favor. Silencio. Thank you. Thank you. On behalf of my daughter, Mercedes and I would like to thank all of you, our loved ones, for coming. Uh... I know the rum is low, but don't worry. I've sent Danny out to get some. Stevie, don't worry. More rum coming. I met Maria when we were 15 on the beach in Varadero. It was Easter vacation, and she walked out of the ocean like a goddess, and I fell in love with her that second. And I will... will love her until the last time I close my eyes. That night, at a club by the sea, a song played... "Yo Te Quiero Siempre." As it played, she took my hand for the first time. She looked at me and asked, "How can anything be so beautiful?" Somehow I found the courage to answer. "You are," I said. We had our first kiss to that song. It... it was our song. So if you would all indulge me, con permiso, I would like to hear it a final time. Hello. Yeah, this is he. Madame Minister. No, I'm very glad to hear from... Okay. Yes. No, I understand. Great. I will get back to you very soon. Adiós.
