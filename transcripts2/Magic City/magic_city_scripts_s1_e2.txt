 Previously on "Magic City"... Tell Mike Strauss I wanna see him. Hoffman's 10:00 a.m. - Easy, Ike. - ( grunts ) We are talking about my goddamn survival, Mike. My hotel, my family. I will do whatever I have to do to stay alive. I'm back two days and already I hear you got union problems. I'd like you to talk to Mike Strauss. Be my date tonight. One of us owns the place, and the other one is the maid. You're a maid like I'm a cabana boy.

 - Your dad... - Works for your dad. Who are you? - Lily: The wrong woman. - Now you tell me. - ( panting ) - ( gun cocks ) ( screaming ) Call off the strike now. Yeah, pull all our guys. It's over. ( theme music playing ) ♪ In the silence of my room ♪ ♪ In the shadow ♪ ♪ And the gloom, you are with me... ♪ Ike: Lemons into lemonade, Nate. Nate: Tremor hits L.A. The hotel's unsafe and now it's my goddamn problem.

 Yeah, the network loves us for your Miss 1959. 550 rooms, 1,500 capacity ballroom. You got it all, Hoss. Everybody knows that. The folks from Phoenix are offering us a hell of a lot more money. But I'm offering you, Nate, not your board, not your shareholders... you, a 10% finder's fee. And I'm offering it only once. Eight days from tonight, Clayton Textile's Miss '59 Pageant either goes live coast to coast or not, Hoss. I don't know, Ike. ( whispers ) Ever heard of a Mother's Milk? ( laughs ) - A Mother's Milk? - Mm-hmm. - ( Nate laughs ) - Open wide. ( laughing ) Oh, Jesus Christ! I should have asked for a double. ( laughing ) Why, Willie, get over here. You gotta try this. Yeah. Hey, why don't you give me the weekend, - run some numbers. - It's yours. I wouldn't mind grabbing that Frank Sinatra suite. No can do, Nate. What, only Frank Sinatra stays in it? What if he ain't here? What, it just sits empty? - Fucking murderer! - Hey, hey! - Hey, Al. - You killed my boy. Al, listen to me. Mikey was my friend, all right? He's missing. He's not gone. Have faith. They're gonna find him. Not where you dumped him. Rot in hell. - Fucking coward. - Hey, hey. Let's go. An old man. He's an old man in shock. Stevie, get our friends a nice cabana, 15-year-old Scotch, and our best pink champagne for the ladies. ( laughing ) Nate: Now we're talking. Holy shit. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, tell victor we'll know more about Miss '59 after the weekend. Prep a full staff meeting for Monday morning in the Trevi. Done. Hey, Pop. Congratulations. Union boss Mike Strauss disappears hours before a big hotel workers' strike. And that would have shut down the Miramar Playa maybe forever. No Mike, no strike. So who benefits the most with Mike gone? - Ike Evans. - He's a hotel guy, not a killer. The Butcher. Havana falls and Ben Diamond is back in Miami playing cards at the Miramar. - We tried, but to get Ben... - We want Ben Diamond, we go through the Miramar lobby. This is Belvin Jaffe. Two years in Leavenworth on a narcotics beef, five in Raiford for vehicular manslaughter, another nickel in Kentucky on extortion and armed robbery. The Butcher has Evans put Bel in the Sea Breeze Lingerie Shop to make book, run card games. Evans lets him. The Butcher uses his Miramar cabana like a goddamn office. Fellas, I see the headline, but where's the story? Evans is a fort. Nobody near him talks. I know somebody inside. Sorry. Excuse me, sir, but I went to school with his son Danny. - Danny Evans. - And? And, well, I was a senior when Danny was a freshman. He's in first year of U of M Law. - Poor schmuck wants to be a lawyer? - ( laughing ) Danny's real smart and a straight arrow. Maybe... I mean, he might wanna... Get his father arrested? Well, no, maybe he wouldn't have to know what we're looking for, exactly. He might even... by accident, he could see something, hear something. I don't know. Clerking for the D.A. looks real good on his resume. - One question. - Yes, sir. Did you get the extra-lean corned beef? ( laughing ) - ( knock on door ) - It's open. Vera. I hope I'm not interrupting you. No, not at all. The Birchers banned "Lady Chatterley's Lover." They hate sex. What the hell is so wrong with a little yum-yum? Nothing. - Some halvah? - No, thanks. I'm not coming to Lauren's thing at the temple. I won't do it. Your wife was a very beautiful woman. Like Hedy Lamarr. She was 20... no, she's 21 there. That's her mother's beaver coat. She wore it to impress me on our first date. I wish she could have met Lauren. She would have spoiled her rotten. Lauren loves you, Arthur. She's your only granddaughter. I love her, too. You know what she told me this morning? She won't go to the Bat Mitzvah if you're not there. Good. Problem solved. I love your son, more than I ever thought I could love someone. Ike doesn't need you to be a perfect Jew. He could give a crap. I know. Then why? These things, these stupid things, they tie us together. They make us a family. At least I want them to. A rabbi? All that bullshit mumbo jumbo? Well, thank you. - Anytime. - Bye. Man: Thank you, sir. Bring it over here. Woman: I'll get a drink for you. Girl: No, I did it, ask mom. ♪ There she is ♪ - ♪ Miss ♪... - Daddy, stop it. All right, I'm sorry, I'll stop. - Ike: ♪ There she is ♪ - Vera! All right, I'm sorry. You just... you look so beautiful. I couldn't help myself. Can you do it, Lo? You'll be in heels. And 500 people will be watching. In heels and 500 people? Ricki: And there will be dry ice smoke just curling up over your ankles. - Really? Dry ice smoke? - Pink. Ricki, this is a Bat Mitzvah. It's not Zorita's. Joanie Siegel had pink smoke. And if Joanie Siegel jumped off a bridge... Ike. Honey, you practice walking with Ricki, okay? Come here. Now we've got a bigger problem than the stairs. - Arthur... he won't come. - Grandpa hates the Jews. Okay, he doesn't hate Jews. He's Jewish. He's just not big on religion, any religion. - Grandpa's a commie. - Danny. - You get him here. - Okay. And you get him to make a beautiful toast to his granddaughter. I will not have us humiliated. You handle that crazy bastard. Look, that crazy bastard happens to be my father. This is your little girl's Bat Mitzvah. Oh, my God. I went to bed with Rita Hayworth and woke up with Golda Meir. - L'chaim. - ( laughs ) ( singing in Italian ) Big thing in Rome. Nobody's got it over here yet. It's brand-new. But you listen to a jukebox. You don't watch it, and it looks like a refrigerator. Yeah, yeah. What? ls that the Butcher's new wife? Hm-mm. I have no idea. You know, leave the thing here. Let me live with it. I'm telling you, Stevie. It's the future. Fuck. ( continues singing ) ♪ Somewhere ♪ ♪ Beyond the sea ♪ ♪ Somewhere waiting for me ♪ ♪ My lover stands on golden sand ♪ ♪ Then watches the ships ♪ ♪ That go sailing ♪ ♪ Somewhere ♪ ♪ Beyond the sea ♪ ♪ She's there watching for me ♪ ♪ If I could fly like birds on high... ♪ Ben: Kid! Come here. Can you get that good sable today, the one from Thrifty's? - Sable? - Yeah. Sable. Sable? Sable? Four with toasted water bagels and schmear. I'll have the pickled herring. Princess? Caviar? - I'll give him my order. - Here. Get the ballbuster's order, will you? Sure. ( sighs ) Sun me, Belvin. - I'll have my usual. - You're crazy. - Do you love it? - No, I really don't. Yes, you do. You should come by tonight. He's out. You're fucking crazy. And no crust on the toast, please. - Focus, boys. - Ike. I'm gonna need a nice table at Triton tonight. It's Sylvia's birthday. I'll have Tony Martin blow out her candles. We're gonna need at least a hundred rooms for the pageant. - Contestants, advertisers, CBS. - So? We don't have 'em. We're at 90% next week. I will personally throw guests onto Collins Ave. Ike, I'm losing my mind here. Maria's... I've got half of Havana working on it. We'll get her out, all right? We will. I promise. - When? - Soon, vic, real soon. No contact in over a week. Mercedes is, you know... it's her mom. You watch the news. They have firing squads every day. Those are Batista's guys getting shot. Maria's a housewife from South Beach. Maria's not a U.S. citizen. She's with her family in Nuevo Vedado, right? She's safe. I'll get her out, vic. I hope. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to find somebody who can. Fellas. Big news, Ike? Close. Live from the Miramar. Fill the rooms? - We're near capacity now. - Fill the rest. Are the girls staying here? - They are. - Need any help? I'm good, Ben. Thank you. - Mr. E. - Diving Dave. Any chance I get a spot? Miss '59, huh? - Do a dive or something? - Right. Who's the horse? - Who's the rider? - Yeah, or whatever. - I mean, I'll kill 'em. - We'll see. Good show today. Always. Ladies, how are you? Oh, our host with the most. ( laughs ) 37 degrees and sleeting in Charleston today. We are never leaving. I'm bringing the gentlemen to Pigalle tonight. Dixie Evans. Miami's own Marilyn Monroe. If we do the show here, we'll need our little Judi. She's been a real lifesaver. What's the word, Nate? My people are gonna need every second - to pull this together. - You Jews and your worrying. I just wanna give you the best show, Nate. You call me when you're ready. You boys have fun tonight. Judi. See you later, Ike. ( rock 'n' roll playing ) Oh, baby, I love this song. ( laughs ) - ♪ Sugar in the morning ♪ - ♪ Sugar in the evening ♪ ♪ Sugar at supper time ♪ ♪ Be my little sugar ♪ ♪ And love me all the time. ♪ - Seen Peggy Reef? - Who? - Never mind. - Oh, the photographer? - Where is she? - In Atlantis, sir. - Ray-Ray. - Mr. E? - Wake up. - Will do, sir. - Tilt your head up a bit. - ( camera shutter clicks ) That's great. An old stripper trick. Seriously. The red light makes the varicose veins disappear. - Now you tell me. - Hey, boss man. - Hi. - Elaine, grab a smoke. - Kids. - Kids. - So I have something for you. - Listening. - Just like the Tony C. job. - Same cabana? Judi's favorite. Tomorrow night after midnight? - Color or black and white? - Peggy, you're the artist. You choose. - If you see Elaine, send her in. - If I see Elaine, I'm taking her home. ( sobbing ) Mind if I sit? Smells like garbage out here. Didn't know you smoked. It's my mother's brand. Lucky. Any word? - ( coughing ) - Here. Here. Put this thing out. If you're trying to help me, then just get her out. Otherwise, just leave me alone. ls that really what you want? There is a plane coming back with some Dorado Rum executives next week. I'm gonna try and get Maria on it. Things are very difficult right now, but we'll try. Please tell Mr. Mendoza how much I appreciate this. No, it's Mendoza brothers' gift to a friend. - Gracias. - De nada. I can't describe to you what I didn't see. How did Mike Strauss get into a room here? He had a key. Someone gave him a key. We're not exactly the Waldorf Astoria. Sterling, you say you were in back watching "Lawrence Welk" when Strauss came in? I say you're full of shit. I say somebody got to you. Do you really want the Florida State Attorney's office to think you're a fucking liar? Here's my number. Call me. Ike: I'm thinking about growing my moustache back. What do you think? Remember, I had it when we first met. You liked it. v. Huh? Sorry. - Never mind. - No. No moustache. What do you mean? When we were in Havana, - you said you loved it. - I lied. - You lied? - Mm-hmm. You don't have to do this, you know, convert, Lo's Bat Mitzvah. The boys weren't. I wasn't. Hey, v. lt really doesn't matter to me. You're the worst Jew in Miami. ( kisses ) Nice. ( doorbell rings ) What the hell? And for your information, my father is the worst Jew in Miami. - ( knock on door ) - ( doorbell rings ) Sorry for the late hour, Ike. He wants you. It's the middle of the night. ls he downstairs? On the boat. Ben's on the boat now? You know the guy never sleeps. What can I say? I'll pick you up out back in 15. This is insane. Do you know what this is about? Who the fuck knows, kid? I'll tell you one thing. lt ain't about fishing. ( gunshots ) ( shouting ) - ( laughing ) - ( indistinct chatter ) Maybe it's a little about fishing. Watch your step. ( laughs ) He's inside. Do you know how much that bearded prick cost me down there in Cuba? I don't know, Ben. Millions? Every week. Millions. Up in smoke. Gone. But he'll be out soon or dead. Dictators change like the weather down there. I'll be back, but this has taught me something, Ike. Options, choices. Gambling on the Beach. Your joint is prewired for slots, tables and wheels, right? You pull up the carpet and the marble, the conduit's just sitting there. You built the Miramar for gambling. You genius! The second it's legal, Ben. Ike, the religious. Ike, the rainmaker. Now how did you get city council to rezone 50 residential acres? Those holy rollers in Tallahassee, never gonna vote... Ike, where are you? What? A simple question. Where are you now? I'm on your boat, Ben. Yes, good. You're on my boat in the Gulf Stream in the middle of a shark-eating frenzy. Are you threatening me, Ben? Abso-fucking-lutely I'm threatening you. Carrot, bull shark, whatever works. Focus, Isaac. We have a moment. One door closes. You built a palace. Now it's time to be king. You and I can wear this town like a diamond necklace. Here. 100 grand. Work that Evans charm on those shit kickers. Where's Mike Strauss? You mean that union guy that you asked me to talk to? I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine. Ike. Happy fishing. ( sighs ) - ( grunts ) - ( dog barking ) ( snarling ) I'll deal with those idiots. They bark at water rats. Max, Hans, schnell, schnell! Here, here! Now get the hell in the house, you stupid Nazis. ( speaks German ) Lily: Fucking... fucking crazy. Lily: Come on. ( moaning ) - ( men, women shouting ) - ( laughing ) ( dog barking ) If you wanna be in the hotel business, then get Conrad fucking Hilton. What?! I am. That's where the 100 grand went. - What?! Fuck. - ( barking ) Because he knows these rednecks upstate. Upstate. They vote. Hold on. ( barking continuing ) ( Lily laughing ) ( gasps ) I'm on the phone. Their next session up in Tallahassee just started. Ike will get them to vote one way or another. Then we'll be done. Pack your swimsuit. I hear you're up to your ass in snow. Besides, it's fucking gorgeous down here. Okay, bye. Don't go. Wait a second. Mr. E, Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce called... - Flo, I need two minutes. - You got one. ( telephone rings ) - Margaret Bannock, please. - May I ask who's calling, please? Yeah, it's Ike Evans. Thank you, Dudley. Dudley's still there. Isaac, you know nothing changes in my world. Hell, it's changing pretty fast out here. Wave, darling, so I can see you. Ike: Still upset I blocked your view. Sweetheart, it makes me cozy knowing your many well-heeled guests are frolicking on my family beach. It's been a long time, Meg. She's been gone for six years. I miss her, too. - How's Verna? - Vera. Yes, Vera. She of the long legs. Look who's talking. We don't speak for six years and you're already flirting. I'm just speaking the truth. How are the boys and Lauren? Good. The boys are men now, and Lauren is almost a teenager. So she's starting to turn on me like a wild animal. - ( laughs ) - They're... they're good. I think, I hope that Molly would be proud of them. You were always a good father. So we've covered all the safe topics. What is it, Ike? What can I do for you after all this time? I'd like to come and discuss something with you. That has a business feel to it. Shame. Now who's flirting? Fine. Of course, business it is. How's tea this Wednesday at the Bath Club? Tea would be great. - Give my love to your children. - Of course. - Till Wednesday. - Until then, Meg. Man: Let me ask you future lawyers what you think is the single biggest threat facing my office today. What criminal activity would you say represents - the gravest danger to our city? - Prostitution. A threat, but not the threat. Yes, our lone woman. Illegal narcotics, drugs. We have seen a surge in drug cases from last year to this, but not the answer. - Yes. - Gambling. Bingo. - ( students laughing ) - And other forms of gambling, too. Gambling is the key. It's the seemingly innocent doorway through which all criminal activity flows. This is from our governor LeRoy Collins, writing in last month's "Parade" Magazine. "Gambling, legal or illegal, spreads poison through a community. lt is insidious. lt kills more business than it generates. lt encourages public corruption and undermines the faith of citizens in their officials. Worst of all, it saps more strength and character." Hey, congrats. Assistant D.A. Assistant State Attorney, actually. Fancy title. Which my mom loves. Mostly I do takeout and clean the blackboard. Still, you're in. - You wanna meet him? - No. No, I can't believe he just showed up here. A bunch of us from the office are going to Luau tonight. I got engaged. - You can meet my fiancée Iris. - Tonight? I know you can dig up a date. Be a blast. He'll probably swing by. Maybe. Maybe. I'll try. Hello? What? What's this castle? Sorry. - You're playing like Inez. - I hear that. You okay? Vera's driving me nuts. It's like she's the one getting Bat Mitzvahed. She probably thinks it's important to you. Why are you defending her? You hate her, too. I hate everyone. And I don't hate her. Vera's all right. You hate her. lt was all your idea to convert and do all this today-you-are-a-woman crap. Everybody I know has had a Bat Mitzvah. Spoken like a Collins Avenue princess. - Let's play for it. - For what? I win, you have to come to my Bat Mitzvah. And if you win, you don't. How about this? Fun Fair for your birthday. Just you and me. All the rides, all the banana splits, whatever you want. I want you there with me. Grandpa. I can't do it, honey. I don't believe in any of it. I never been inside a temple in my life. Then come after. Come to my party. It's your move, sweetheart. - Buenos dias, Señor Evans. - Guess so. - vincent, I'm back. - Got it. That was half an hour. - Ay, gracias. - De nada. - What are you doing here? - Picking you up. - What? - For our date. What are you talking about? We don't have a date. You're coming with me to the Luau tonight now. - Danny. - Mercy, please. I have to have dinner with this guy, this UM law grad who works for the D.A. I think I might actually have a shot at working there. The D.A., Jack Klein himself, might show tonight, and I can't just come alone, so... Look, don't call me Mercy, okay? I'm not 10. Mercedes. I'm just not very good company. Hey, hey. I miss her. And I'm scared. My father is just... Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take it out on you earlier. Then make it up to me now. Really, come on. I'll have you back by 9:30. Egg roll, barbecued ribs. Crab rangoon. - That's too expensive. - ( laughs ) Vera: Pigs in a blanket? Yeah, it's finger food. Tiny hot dogs wrapped in dough. Pork? Hebrew National. I want egg rolls. So weird for a Bat Mitzvah party, no? What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten? Jesus, Lo, come on. Let me think. I ate tulips. Two lips? No, the flower. Tulips. At the end of the war, the Germans kept the food out of Holland. And you know, we were kids and starving, so somebody had the bright idea to eat the flowers. - Did you get sick? - I survived. Danny! There's Danny and Mercedes. Stevie: Isn't that Jack Klein? Okay, we are done here. Miss. - Aren't you gonna say hi? - No, we're gonna hit the road... What about the Hawaiian pineapple cheesecake? We're gonna hit the road, okay? Danny's having a business meeting. And I'm gonna take you to Lincoln Road for ice cream, okay? - Come on, kid. - Ike. ( camera shutter clicks ) You should have told me about him. Would it have made a difference? No. That's my guy. You'll burn this, right? Yeah, I don't want anyone seeing how big your ass really is. ( laughs ) You know, I broke my first rule with you. Oh, yeah, what's that? Never date a woman whose husband's named the Butcher. ( thunder crashes ) ls there something I should know? About? You saw the D.A. and went white as a ghost. You ran out. I didn't run out. You know my kids, they have their own lives. Danny was having a business dinner. ls this about Ben? Listen to me. I'm only gonna tell you this once. Ben Diamond is nothing. He is part of doing business on the Beach, a natural hazard, like tar in the sand or a jellyfish in the ocean. I'm not scared of anyone, Klein included. I'm clean. I run a clean shop. Now if Klein sees one jellyfish in the whole ocean and thinks it's too dangerous to swim, then that's his problem. ( sighs ) I'm sorry I've been so crazy. I just wanted it to be nice for Lo. Everybody will be there. All the Surfside ladies. Those rich harpies hate me, Ike. I'm the shiksa bitch who got the prince. I am no prince. Ha ha. And you... you are barely a shiksa anymore. Come here. I know this isn't easy, stepping into my life. I know, and I'm sorry. You know what happened today? I was picking Lauren up at school. She was with her friends. She called me "Mom." lt just came out. She's crazy about you. I hope. I love her. But I know... I know I'm not Molly. Well, and as tough as it is, I guess we need to keep on trying to have our own kids. Rough job, huh? Brutal. ls it? You take my breath away. ( rain falling ) Don't even think about it. - The cushions are getting wet. - That makes two of us. ♪ Sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening... ♪ - ( camera shutter clicks ) - Nate: What the... No! Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you, God damn it! ♪ And love me all the time ♪ ♪ Be my little honey ♪ ♪ And love me all the time. ♪ - He wants to talk. - Begging to. Facing amorals. Seems he lives with his mom. She doesn't know, ugly stuff. - What's his name? - Sterling Voss. Name like that, you gotta be a queen, right? Thank you, Detective. Sterling, I'm Jack Klein, the State Attorney for Dade County. This is my colleague Ethan Bell. The D.A.? I held somebody's hand. I didn't kill 'em. No, actually, you sexually propositioned a male police officer. You're facing felony morals charges. You'll spend the next four years in Raiford Penitentiary, which maybe in your case, isn't such a bad thing. Sterling, there's a reporter out there for the "Miami Herald." He's asking for your name in the story. No, please, no. You can't. Who was with Mike Strauss when he checked into the Fleetwood Hotel on New Year's Eve? If I tell you this... You walk out of here through the basement garage a free man. No one knows. No one sees you. This never happened. You can do that? I need a name. I'll give you a fashion show as soon as we get back to the hotel. Judith Diane Silver, Dade County Homicide. - Take a hike. - What is this about? The disappearance of Mike Strauss. Okay... thanks.
