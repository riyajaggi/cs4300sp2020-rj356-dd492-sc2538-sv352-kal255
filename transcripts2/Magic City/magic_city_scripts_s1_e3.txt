 Previously on "Magic City"... - You killed my boy! - Al, listen to me. Mikey is my friend, all right? He's missing. He's not gone. Who was with Mike Strauss when he checked into the Fleetwood Hotel? Sweetheart, it makes me cozy knowing your many well-heeled guests are frolicking on my family beach. It's been a long time, Meg. You should have told me about him. - Lily: Would it have made a difference? - No. You'll burn this, right?

That's great, but I need a little more. The dance goes like this, right? Okay? So have a little fun. Big smiles. All right, take five. Don't see this in Tallahassee every day. Probably a good thing, Senator. Senator: Miss Iceland, a viking princess. Ike: Literally. Purest stock on Earth. No mixing of the breeds on that rock, I can tell you. Look at her hair. Spun gold. Bet her teeth are even perfect. Let's find out. Sweetheart. Been married to the same woman for 22 years. Thank you, though, but if my Irma were to tragically pre-decease me, that Nordic goddess would certainly improve the gene pool. We must always look to the future. Yes, to the future. Your committee is meeting next month on casino gambling. You are a smooth and charming host, Ike. And you can make me laugh, which is a tonic. So let's set our ground rules and we can continue to enjoy one another's company, shall we? Fair enough. I will never... ever... lend my name to your casino gambling. We'll leave morality and the law of God out of it for now and let's just deal with what you people do best. Business. No matter how much money you hotel folks have, our legal pari-mutuel gambling has more, much, much more. They were here first. Bigger. And, Ike, they are not going anywhere. While you sit here and dream about perfect Nordic teeth, hundreds of millions of incredibly untaxed dollars are being spent on bolita, numbers, cards and sport book. So here's a question I have for you. Can you really ever be rich enough? Be that as it may. ( clears throat ) New business? I think it would be incredibly rude if I were not to extend a warm Florida greeting to our young Icelandic visitor. My pleasure, Senator. Stevie, can you help the Senator with whatever he needs? Thank you, Ike. Steve. Senator: Follow me. ( laughing ) Pan Am flies to Beirut, Istanbul, Frankfurt, London. Don't you wanna see all those places? Someday, sure. Right now, - everything I want is right here. - ( elevator bell dings ) Man: Open the damn door! Anybody in the hall just now? - No. - All right, our guy just hit 1005. You guys go down to nine. Mack and I will take 11. - We'll meet on the roof. - Yes, sir, come on. That was crazy. Just like a movie, right? vincent will get him. Housekeeping. I'll see you later. Thanks for the coffee and the company. Okay. Hey, you can call me Mercy. I like it. I always have. Okay. ( women laughing ) Ray-Ray: Welcome to the Miramar Playa, gentlemen. Hey, you know it would be nice to keep a few of those pageant gals around after Saturday. You know, a little R&R; for 'em, for us How about a week? The Miramar insists. A gentleman and a scholar. Listen to me, sir. The Trident seats 5,000 for the pageant. We're already 300 over the fire marshal's... His cousin. Do you have a cousin named Stanley Sutnick? - Nope. - Nice try, sir. Hanging up. ( clicks ) What's his name? Sterling voss. He was the Fleetwood's night clerk when Judi and Mike checked in. Wait a minute. I thought you took care of this guy. He was paid, then he got popped on the beach with some vice cop's johnson in his hand and all bets were off. And that's it? That's all Klein has? That's what I hear. That's nothing. Unless voss testifies under oath to a grand jury. That could mean court-approved wiretaps. The whole nine yards. I wish Mike would just walk through that door. Unlikely. But without a body, it's technically still a missing persons. But that's not gonna last forever. Talk to voss. Will do. We had another break in. Guest walked in on a guy and he bolted over the balcony empty-handed. Over the balcony? - We'll get him. - No, now, vincent. You get him now, all right? The whole world is watching us. Catch this asshole. How's Judi holding up? That girl is as hard as a diamond. - Thank you, vincent. - ( intercom buzzes ) Woman: Mrs. v on one. ( Vera crying ) v. v, what's wrong? - She cancelled. - What, who has cancer? No, canceled, canceled. Jackie Kennedy just canceled. Oh. Oh. Did she give a reason? Yes, I'm gypsy trash and she doesn't wanna be seen with me. - Wait, she said that? - No, Jesus, Ike. Her social secretary said she was called out of town. Some conflict on her calendar. Blah, blah, blah. Ike, this lunch is for her. Invitations went out. My name is on it. Your people, those ladies are coming because Jackie Kennedy will be there. I knew it. I'm a joke. I shouldn't have even tried. v, v, is there any way we can talk about this later tonight? Of course. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My life is so small and stupid. - No. - This Bat Mitzvah, this dopey luncheon. Okay, your life is not dopey. It's just that I... No, no, I get it. You have a real life, but you do know there was a time... Yes, I know, and you gave it all up for me. - ( clicks ) - V. Jesus Christ. ( big band music playing ) Esther and I used to dance to this. ( laughing ) ( Arthur coughs, grunts ) Arturo, sit down. Arturo. ( speaks Spanish ) Arturo. Arturo. Ike, I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do. You know, I'm not a nurse, but your father make me wear the outfit. Inez, it's okay. It's fine. How is he? I don't know. He faint. I don't know. Doctor says he no die. Thanks God. Sweetheart, pull yourself together, okay? I'm so sorry. Pop? That's my son, honey. This handsome fella here is my boy. He's gotta rest. I'll give you two a couple minutes. - He's gonna be okay, right? - Yeah, if they stop poking me - like a turkey. - Blood pressure spiked. He fainted. He's on new medication. If he behaves, he'll be home tomorrow. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. What the hell, Pop? Did you see my hat? Yeah. Here you go. How are you feeling? I'm 100 years old and I black out when I do the Lindy. I'm terrific. Shit, I miss your mother. I know. Me too, Pop. 52 years I never went to bed without telling her I loved her. So another year alone. What the hell? This too shall pass, huh? That's what you always say. But what do I know? You know I'm proud of you, kid. Look what you did, what you built. The biggest, the best. - Fontainebleau, Deauville, pissers. - Pop. I'm not embarrassed. I did okay. Had a good thing. Sundries, a little sports book on the side. You, you son of a bitch, you dreamed big. Listen to me, Isaac, okay? - Mm-hmm. - They're inside already. Don't deny it. I know what I know. They're a cancer. Very hard to cut out. The surgery could kill you. You got one chance. Stay strong, stay healthy, stay alive. You can live with the cancer. lt may cost you a few bucks, a few sleepless nights, your pride, but you stick around. You hang in there. You survive, and then who knows? It's a long ballgame. My money's on you, kid. Send Inez in. Are you sure? You only go around once in life. And sometimes not even then. What do you say? Ben: Have somebody come to the house then. Maurice won't, and he's the best. - Come on, sweetie. - Then Al will take you. You bought me a new T-Bird, baby. I drive better than Al. Come on, Ben, she's right. I hate that fucking toy. You, get in the car. Sweetie, baby, if I didn't know any better, I would think you were fucking the gardener. Since when do you get your hair done at night? lt was the only time he had left. You wanna call him? When you worked as a mermaid up in Weeki Wachee, how long did you say you could hold your breath? - Why? - A number, please. Three and a half minutes. Not long enough. You really don't know me at all, do you? "Gunsmoke" is on. There's stone crabs in the 'fridge. Have a nice night in, sweetie. ( telephone rings ) - Hello? - I can't make it. Are you okay?

I'm just directing these sweaty sows for CBS. - The "Miss 1959" show? - Uh-huh. Somebody's gotta do it. That's fantastic. You coming to the luncheon? No, I'm help. I've gotta eat with the cattle. - That's crazy. Come on with us. - No, no, no. I'm cool. I've got too much to do anyway, so... but how about tomorrow night?

Your senator left claw marks on Belgium. - ( laughing ) - Ike: Oh, Christ. Who's here? "The Beach Sun," the "Herald News," A.P., U.P. - And? - You get to see everything first. They'll want to be invited back. - Whoa! ( laughs ) - ( woman screams ) - You get her. I'll get him. - Hey! No pictures. Ike, I do not know where this girl gets her alcohol. ( laughing ) - Senator, this way. - Okay. Can I get you a cup of coffee? He tried to touch my pee-pee. J.T.S. Brown, straight up. Very nice party, Ike, very nice. Good crowd. You know, I think those girls of yours are very clean. I mean, very clean. Huh? I like those European gals the best, though. - Right, yeah, good teeth. - Ha ha! You know, son... ( clears throat ) I cannot be bought. But I can be rented. ( laughing ) - Okay. - Hey, listen, when I get back to Tallahassee, you and I gotta talk, all right? Sounds good. Now where do I put this empty glass? Yeah, Pablo, there you go. Thank you, sir. Senator: Absinthe. Thank you, my good man. - ( senator sighs ) - Look who I found in the lobby. It's nice to see you. ( kisses ) - Doesn't she look beautiful? - As always. - The lonely widow diet. - Don't say that. It's only been a few weeks. You're right. Of course. Ike, could I have a minute? Absolutely, yeah. - v, maybe Steve can show... - I'm fine, sweetie. I'll be here. So nice to see you, Annie. - You're in our prayers. - Thanks, v. Okay, let's step out here. Ike. I wanted you to hear this from me. I know that you didn't have anything to do with Mike. You loved him since you were kids, and I know he loved you. His father's gone crazy, blaming anybody and everybody. I just wanted to tell you that. V's right. He's only been gone a couple... He's dead. I can feel it. You know it, too. Michael, our Mike, he was a bulldog. He got his teeth into something, pissed a lot of people off. I know that. A lot of scary people. I just... we just miss him so. I'm hurting. I am. But I do not want your charity, Ike. - Charity? - The money. Every Monday since he's gone. Don't bother denying it. It's got you written all over it. I can't say that we don't need it, but I work for my money. Okay. What do you wanna do? What, here? It's a big place. We hire a lot of people. Well, uh... I can cook. Bake. I was a pastry girl at Junior's when I met Mike. I can make a rugelach that'll bring you to your knees. You start tomorrow. Okay, you find Andre, our head chef. I will call him and let him know. - Really? Just like that? - Just like that. I'll expect rugelach on my desk tomorrow by noon. I know why he loved you. No more cash in the mailbox. I promise. - Man: Come on, let's go. - ( jazz music playing ) I got nothing to say to you. Why not? You're talking to everybody else. - Miami Beach vice. - He's lying. - You're hurting me. - Yeah. They promised you there's gonna be a secret grand jury, right? They swore your testimony would never be made public. Let go of my arm, please. You testify at 9:00 A.M. Everybody in Miami Beach will know you're a faggot by lunchtime. Nothing is secret, Sterling, ever. That is a lie. I know. I can tell you the name of each and every secret grand jury. I can tell you where and when you're gonna testify. I can even tell you what room in the Biscayne Hotel they're gonna put you in the night before. Now do you see how fucked you are? What can I do? Button up, recant and deny. They'll throw me in Raiford. No, they might just maybe keep you six months maximum for the morals thing. They'll tell my mother. Kid, that's pretty much a done deal either way. My advice... you tell yourself you take control of this thing. She's your mother. She probably knows anyhow. All right, here's five grand. Take it. You tell Klein you made a mistake. You forgot. Then you go, you buy your mother something nice and you tell her the truth. Then you get on with your life, but do not make me come get that money back from you, okay? - I said, "Okay?" - Okay. It's gonna be all right, kid. Don't worry about it. - ( intercom buzzes ) - Woman: Your wife is here. - Hey. - Big meeting or a new girlfriend? Why not both? One twist on this knot, and you're Johnnie Ray. There. Beautiful. Thank you. You seem better. ls Jackie back on for lunch? Are we free tonight? I've got a pageant advertisers buffet I need to go to, but I can do a drive-by. Why? The guy that's directing the show, the "Miss 1959" Tv show, is an old friend from the Tropicana. Cliff Wells. Two words I hate together. Friend and Tropicana. So I was thinking maybe we should go to the Latin Quarter, catch a show, dance. Am I invited? Yes, dopey, you and Cliff and me. Cozy. Mm-hmm. So can I tell him we're on? Late show, like 10:00? I'll bet he's a good dancer. I don't remember. Probably. Don't be jealous. You have other good qualities, sweetheart. So who are you meeting with? ( laughs ) Nobody. Just some banker. Meg Bannock. You certainly do know how to make an entrance. And you've lost some of your rough edges. - Do you approve? - Success becomes you. Please. Will you be having tea today with us today, Miss Bannock? ls this is really just a business meeting? Your call. What's your best Scotch? Do you have the four-year-old Springbank? Walter, we'll have the four-year-old Springbank. Good choice. Two, Wally. So what time does the big Jew hunt start? Oh, please. Come on, without you, I'd be on the curb. Well, then enjoy it while you can. Why did you wanna meet here? My turf. Fair enough. To Molly. ( glasses clink ) This is harder than I thought. I don't think you and I, have we ever been together without her? Once. The funeral. You don't understand why all these years I didn't... You look at me. I look at you, but all we see is her. Okay, please. Something else. So, Margaret Bannock. I don't read the society pages as much as I should. Are you married? Twice. The last one just moved back to Denver. He missed his mother, or I reminded him of his mother. Something maternal. So yes, once again, I'm the gay divorcee. Why? Do you know any eligible men? Nobody in your league. Mmm. This is nice. Like smoke, peat smoke. You always knew the best of everything. Except of course, you chose the wrong Bannock girl. You used to call me the cabana boy. You used to be one. Besides, I was just testing you. And I failed. Who's to say? Here we are. There's something I wanna talk to you about. - Uh-oh, where's Walter? - Oh, nice. Please, Ike. No charts or graphs. Not yet, just talk to me. Okay. I want you to buy out my partner. You want me? You would own 49% of the Miramar Playa. You buy my family's land for a song, tear down our family home, and then you want to sell me half? 49%. 49% at what I assume is current market value. Show me the books. Senator: Tallahassee martini... The usual, beautiful boy. Judi. Hmm. On the lips. To what do I owe this honor? Well, I'm happy to see you. I'm happy to be here. D.A. Fuck kept me in the courthouse basement - for two days. - Really? What did he want now? That's confidential information. Oh. Where is Mike Strauss? How would you know that? Exactly. So he just let you out, huh? - For now. - ( women laughing ) Hi. How long are the amateurs in town? Till Sunday. Babe, they don't hold a candle to my Silver girl. - Oh. - What? I just came. Hey, Dandy, what'll it be? - Judi. - Albert. Easy, doll, you're looking flushed. Hey, he wants to see you. In his cabana. What, now? No, next Shavuot. Cuda, can you spell me? - Good luck. - Thanks. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah. Ike: Good news. I got Maria on a plane out. It's not 100%, but it looks good. When? How? Next week. They're gonna call me as soon as they know. - It's safe? - It's safe. Thanks. Thank you. I spoke to her yesterday from her mom's place, and she's fine. She's okay. She's just scared, you know? - Crazy over there. - It's crazy everywhere. I wouldn't tell her anything over the phone, okay? No, right. If you're not involved in the hand, Heshie, - just shut the fuck up. - ( laughing ) Hey, kid. Benny, the kid. You got something you wanna tell me. What? What? What do you mean what? I'm asking you what. Uh... I'm sorry. I don't know what... Oh, but you do. You do know. You just didn't think I'd find out. ( stammers ) Schmuck. Second story guy from the Miramar. Right. ( clears throat ) No, I thought my pop would have, you know... Some yutz has been hitting suites - from the fucking balconies. - Here at the Miramar? Who's that fucking crazy? My dad and vincent are all over it. You tell your dad if he wants, I'll deliver the prick's hand - in a pickle jar. - Are the pageant girls okay? Yeah, sure, they don't even know it's happening. Hey, Stevie, catch this guy soon, - or I will. - Thanks. I'll tell him, yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Bel: Come on, who's opening? Man: I will. ( panting ) - Ike. - Yeah. Cliff Wells. Vera's old friend. Cliff, right. Well, congratulations on everything. The drop-dead place, the drop-dead wife. - I'm a lucky man. - We both are. ( man claps ) Wow. - Too much? - No. No. ( kisses ) You look amazing. Like they say in the Trop, use it or lose it. ls that what they say? Then it is already lost. Cliff: Yeah. Clifford, I'm just a mom now. Yeah, the last of the red hot mamas, huh? ( laughing ) Please tell me that's not your ex-wife. - Who is it? - That's Meg... Margaret. - Meg Bannock. - Of course it is. Can you give me a second? Money's honey. What? Well, it looks like business. Take your time. lt is, actually, business. Yeah, then take your time. Could you get me a gimlet? Sure. Looks like I interrupted a night out. - Why are you here? - Lovely to see you, too. I got tired of studying the numbers. Thought it'd be more fun to finally see the real thing. I'm sorry. Just seeing you here is... it's great. No, it is. If you just give me one second, I will take you on a grand tour. I think Verna's coming, and she looks a bit cranky. Sorry. Verna... Vera, this is my... this is Meg Bannock. Meg, finally. A pleasure. I'm so sorry for bursting in on all of you. I'm rarely spontaneous. Now I remember why. You look stunning. Why, thank you. Hi, I'm Cliff Wells, third wheel. Cliff, Meg. I'll be fine. You go on. I'll just have a quick look around. ls this your first time at the Miramar Playa? In a way. Ike bought this property from Meg's family and then built the Miramar Playa. - That's right, isn't it? - Close enough. Vera, would you mind if I met you at the Quarter? I'd really like to show Meg the place. Why? - Another time, really. - Why? - Meg: Please. - Because I do. Okay? You and Cliff go have the first dance, and I'll see you there soon. I can come back. I just live... No, you know what? Ike's right. Please, and Cliff and I wanna catch up. Yeah, I'll have her back by dawn. ( laughs ) - It's okay? - It's better than okay. All right, I'll have Duke drive you. ( kisses ) Don't wait up. - I'll be there soon. - Of course you will. Oh, and make sure he shows you the kosher kitchen. It's his pride and joy. - Vera. - She's beautiful. Miss Bannock, what would you like to see first? The kosher kitchen. ( Latin jazz music playing ) ( laughing ) ( song ends ) Two banquet halls, two nightclubs, a movie theater. It's... You've built a city. Feels bigger sometimes. Well, when we were little, I used to build castles. You know, those drip sand castles right where that pool is. I used to love this beach. I hated you. I know. You took her. You took this. - You let her... - No, Meg, that wasn't me. That was the cancer. I loved her. We loved each other. Who knows? Maybe I hated you for that, too. - ( gasps ) - Shh. Hey. He's out with his whore. Wait. So you just left? Do you mind? No. No. Can you just hold me? Sure. I said just hold me. I thought she was gonna tackle you. She was so jealous. You're crazy. And you are a star. Star housewife. Listen, I'm going back to New York to direct the "Arthur Murray" show for NBC. Come with me. - Stop. - I'm dead serious.
