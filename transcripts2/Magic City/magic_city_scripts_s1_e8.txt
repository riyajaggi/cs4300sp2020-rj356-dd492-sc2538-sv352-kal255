 He created that show when you first saw me, when you first fell in love with me. No, you are my wife. You do not dance anymore. Are you absolutely sure? Ike never gave me one red cent from you. People will die tonight. That is a promise. Be back with my money before then. - What have you done? - I am in trouble. I will give you 15% of my shares for $100,000. Why am I here? Shoes is lying here with mashed potatoes for brains

 and Judi has disappeared. My guess is you hope she stays disappeared. Why, Miss Silver, you've gone red. Get me out of here. No. Get me my lawyer. No. Well, then get me a fucking cigarette. No. You gutless piece of shit! Fuck you! Kill all the lights in her room and hold her food. You fucking asshole! - For how long? - Till I change my mind. His place had been trashed. The loot was all over his houseboat. What kind of stuff? The usual... jewelry, cash. And? We found dope... heroin, his works. The clown was a junkie. Must be why he did it. What a mess. Well, thank you for handling this quietly. I appreciate it. Vincent, why don't you take him up to the Riviera? Breakfast on us. Make sure they try the pastry. It's homemade. We'll stay in touch, Mr. Evans. Thank you. Housekeeping. Wow. The maid outfit's sexier, right? You did it. In two hours. You really not gonna come? I have midterms, you know? You'd tell me if it was something else, right? Something else? Like what? I don't know. That's what you really want... to leave, see the world. It's your dream. Please come. I want you to be there, be happy for me. I am... happy for you, I am. I just can't. I have work, you know? But you'll be at the Riviera, right? Sure. Of course. Looks like your dad's throwing a royal wedding. It's gonna be some party. Well, gotta go get my wings. Congratulations, Mercy. Yes, indeed, Miami Beach, the sun and fun capital of the world, has a new royal palace... the world-famous Miramar Playa Hotel, truly the crown jewel of the Magic City. That was gorgeous. Then we show them the Triton remodel. We remind them about Sinatra's SRO New Year's run in the Triton, how much they loved doing the Miss '59 here last month. So who exactly is gonna be there tonight? Garry Moore refuses to fly, but somehow, don't ask me how, I begged his producer and new director to come down, on our dime, of course. Ike, this is it. This is our one and only shot at this. They'll be with the CBS team, whom we know. So it's a friendly room. Alan Kyle, Garry's producer... he says that if this new director likes us, we got a shot. What's his name? Garry stole him from Arthur Murray's show. It's Cliff Wells. - Ideal. - You know him? Old friend of v's. Great. Get her up here today. No, I'm serious... whatever it takes. Ike, you sell this guy. You close this thing. We need this. With this show, our year is set. All right, you know what? Let's keep our panties on, boys. Remember, attraction beats promotion. - What the hell does that mean? - lt means we are the Miramar Playa. We are the best. They would be lucky to have us. We don't get sweaty. We don't beg for this. We will survive either way. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Thank you for your hard work. I'll see you back here at 5:00. Ike, if Vera knows this guy, it might not be a bad idea to have... We'll be okay, vic. Whatever you think. So I'm gonna go to Mercy's graduation. I'll be back in time for the pitch. Do we get the Pan Am discount now? Not you losers, but Maria and I get to fly for 10%. The second she's back, we're gonna go on a trip. I'm gonna take her to Barcelona, Paris. Congrats, Vic. It's huge for Mercy. Hey, are you gonna be there later? You kidding? I love a gal in a uniform. - Pop, see you at 5:00. - See you then. Getting off to a great start, right in the middle of the pack is Miss World, showing tremendous speed... Sea Breeze. Yeah, hang on. It's Dougie for you. Yeah, Dougie? Uh-huh. Okay. Let me decide what it's worth. All right already, let's hear it. Really? Huh. Where are you guys keeping her? Okay, fine. Tell me, then. I'll talk to the guy. I'll get back to you. This could maybe make you whole again, Dougie boy. That's enough. Enough for now. - Okay. - I have time. Roddy, leave us for a bit. Does your man know you're here? What are you doing, girl? I'm dancing. - You're lying. - It's a small lie. There are no small lies. I love this, Cesar. And I'm a better woman for him, a better wife, if I can be whole. This is why he fell in love with me. This is who he fell in love with. You need to tell him that, not me. When it's time. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. I have to see my Babalawo, my healer. et me get you to a good doctor, huh? A real doctor. Go home, soak those old-lady feet of yours. Hasta luego, my friend. Hasta luego. Would you like to be queen for a day? You know where they have her? Not yet. Dougie wants relief first. Well, then I'll relieve him. Fine, cut his vig in half. Find out where and how she's being protected. Miss Silver is more of an irritant at this point than a threat. And I want all this gone... loose ends. Will do. Now all right. Now then, if you're elected our queen, it'd be a pleasure... See that poor thing? Her husband is a marine stationed in El Toro. She has two little babies of her own and she takes in stray neighborhood kids to make ends meet. And she still won't be a queen for a day. You know why? Huh-uh. Bad teeth. No one wants to see her smile when she wins. That's impressive. Want to race? Not a chance. So I keep wondering, what does a limited partner actually do? Well, either silent, ceremonial - or... - Or? Or you can be a pain in the ass. Now that sounds like fun. - A cigarette? - Yeah. So I brought the papers if you want to have your lawyer take a look at them. No need. I can sign them right now. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Can I trust you? Yes. Well, then hand me a pen and let's make it official. There you go. You know, once I sign this, we are... we'll be connected again. I think we always have been. I know you're in there. I can see your shadow under the door. Cliff. lt is I, Ulysses, back from the wars. May I come in? I bear good news. Sure. Of course, come in. Well, look at you, barefoot, smelling of French soap, and wearing a bathrobe. You are a cruel woman. And you're relentless. Coffee, juice? Uh, vodka... rocks, please. Aren't you curious as to why I'm back in Miami? Terrified. Well, fear not. I am done begging you to come to me. I am, however, considering coming to you. What? Your husband is desperate for Garry Moore to do a weekly CBS show here. I wouldn't say he's desperate. Ike doesn't need... Oh, trust me, he does. And you know what the fun part is? Guess who's directing "The Garry Moore Show" now. Guess who Garry has flown all the way to Miami Beach to make his final decision for him... Eden Roc, Fontainebleau, or the Miramar Playa. Drumroll, please. - You. - Ain't life grand? Well, you must do it here. - Must I? - Oh, stop it. What's it worth to you? - Would you dance for me? - What, now? Well, now would be fantastic, but, no, I was thinking more about on the show. If Garry does the show here, would you be my leading dancer? You're insane. I... Okay, well, you tell me. You were always very brutal about your own dancing, so can you still cut it? Hey. Love, guess what Cliff is doing here? My very next question. - Ike. - Cliff. I hope you don't mind. No, not at all. I will join you. Ike, Cliff is directing "The Garry Moore Show." So I hear. Congratulations. We'll be seeing you at 5:00? Yeah. It'd be lovely if it all works out. Lovely. I'm gonna try and grab an ocean swim and a massage before the big meeting. As always, Miss v. Till then. I'll let myself out. What an idiot. From Wolfie's. Yes? Yes... So... how much do you get paid to fuck strange men? Must be fairly lucrative. What do you want? An answer. How much? Or do you actually like fucking strange men? ls that it? Really, does your work give you pleasure? Now, that I would respect. I also love my work. I do. I would... I would do it for free. I would. I see myself as a surgeon. You know, I cut away the disease that feeds off us and sickens us all. One way or another, Miss Silver, I will remove you from our community. I will either throw you in a dark hole for a few years; I will relocate you under an assumed name in a different state... or I will claim that you attacked me and I will fire this gun in your face. What do you want? What do you want? What have you got? Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I saw Ike Evans kill a man. Where? What man? In the Glades somewhere. I don't know. Near a fucking lake. - I don't know the guy. - Could you identify him? Yes, yes, yes. Fuck, yes. You actually saw Ike Evans kill him? Ike... Ike beat him to death. He saved my life. Twice. Wait. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry to drag you down here, but I thought it was important. Over there. A friend of vic's? - Stevie. - What? Yeah, that's what he said. - Mrs. Diamond. - Mr. Evans. Ben's up on the roof getting a massage, so I thought I'd finally come down and see the fabulous Atlantis Lounge. Stevie's world. Very nice to see you again. You too. Al's getting a paper. I can only stay a second. I got them back... photos, Polaroids, negatives... everything... and burned them and watched them all burn. Thank God. Stevie, thank God. That's great. - It's okay. We're okay. - There you are. Jesus, I thought you fell into the pool. Ike Evans. You wanted to see me? Pierce Fuller, Double Check Corporation. I'm a friend of victor Lazaro's. Stevie, how about a Pabst? I'll just have a coffee. My company still has many contacts inside Cuba. We are... we actively support the mission for a free Cuba in whatever way that we can. And you are helping get Maria out? We were. What happened? Maria and several others were gunned down early this morning while awaiting... - Gunned down? - She died. Maria Lazaro is dead. I'm so sorry. The body has not been recovered, but witnesses... Wait, then you don't know for sure. Maria was hit with several rounds of .30-caliber machine gun fire. She's dead, disappeared in Matanzas Bay. I assumed, I hoped that it would be better for victor if he heard this from... from family. I'm so sorry. If there's anything... Find her body. We'll try. I know he loved her. I can't imagine... No. You really can't. I appreciate you coming down and telling me. Of course. You know, he was telling me that by this time next year, the entire transcontinental fleet would be jets. Amazing, right? Yeah, I love the new 707. It's beautiful. So are you. Your mother, when she sees those photos... I wish she could have been there. So do I. And Danny too. - Papi, I... - He will never marry you... never. - You don't know that. - No, I do know that, because I've known this boy since he was in diapers. He's gonna go to some fancy law firm and marry some upper-class blonde WASP... - You don't know him. - ...or a rich Jewish girl with money and connections, some rich gringa, not some Cuban... What? Maid? He loves me. No. I love you. Your mother loves you. This boy... he will break your heart. That boy is my heart. - We gotta get inside. - I know. Mercedes... vic, vic, I need a second. - Excuse me one second. - This won't wait. What's happened? It's Maria, vic. She... I am so sorry, vic. She... she's gone. Gone? What do you mean, gone? What are you saying? She was killed, vic. - She was shot, vic. - No, no, no. No, you don't know. You don't say this to me. You don't say this to me. Vic. Never goes away, really, does it? Maria made you think of Molly, of losing her. You are a wise woman. A gypsy. I promised vic. I swore to him that I would get her... You did everything you could do. You do everything for all of us. You carry this enormous thing, this impossible weight on your back every day. It's too much, but you do it somehow. No guilt. None. You hear me? Would you do something for me? Anything. I could use your help today at the presentation. Me? After all this, I'm not sure how it will go, how I'll do. And God knows this idiot Cliff is all moonie over you, as he should be. Yes, of course. I will help you. It's all I want. Just be there with me. Always. Are you okay? You? What? I think I'm pregnant. You joke now, but we'll see who's laughing at the altar. Would that be so bad? I'm leaving. My mom comes home, and three weeks later... You go to New York, right? I feel so cheap. I really do love you, Danny Evans. Prove it. Maybe later. Maybe. Something to remember me by. So the priest says to the actress, "If you carry on like that, you're gonna have to confess to somebody else." All hail. Welcome to the Miramar Playa. Gentlemen, this is my beautiful wife Vera Evans. Please sit. So let's put on a show. The Miramar Playa Hotel, soaring above pristine white beaches and turquoise seas, sun and fun by day, elegance and glamour by night. I'm Florida State's Attorney Jack Klein. Come experience one of our lovely ballrooms... Isaac Michael Evans, you are under arrest for the murder of James Patrick Jimmy "Shoes" Clayton. Hey, get away from him. Stevie, it's okay. Gentlemen, please stay. Enjoy the film. I will be back shortly. - That's not necessary. - Cuff him. Florence, the lights, please. Gentlemen, can I get you refills? Welcome to Miami Beach... - never a dull moment. - The Miramar Playa Hotel... a modern-day palace fit for a king, where all your vacation dreams will come true. - Stay with v. - I will. Dad. - It's okay. Call Sid. - Okay. - Get on this. - Done. I'll follow you down to the precinct. Not today. Boss man. - Whoa. - Sorry, sir. Mr. Evans. Hello. What? That's priceless. In fucking handcuffs? Have Doug call me. The king is dead. Long live the king. Better acoustics, a larger venue. We've proven we can successfully host a televised event five times larger than your show. Our boxing feed last week and the Miss '59 live, televised events were highly rated. This is all great, really. I mean, the Miramar Playa is clearly the finest resort down here, but... and I really hope I don't offend you, Mrs. Evans, but, my God, we all just saw Ike Evans arrested for murder and led out of here in handcuffs. "Garry Moore" is a family variety show. We just can't have... My husband is a better man than anybody in this room, and I really hope I haven't offended you. He's the victim of a lie, a smear campaign by a jealous man. And trust me, he will be fully vindicated before you leave Miami. This is nothing. Everybody knows your husband's reputation, Mrs. Evans. We will host your show for free... ...for the first six months as a show of our appreciation and good faith. You will have, as you say, the finest, and for nothing. Also I will deliver to you the great Cesar Ramos to choreograph the most amazing dances ever seen on American television. Cesar is still alive? I danced for him today. I would... I could dance for you too, if you'd like, for your show. Okay. Well, this has been quite an afternoon. Thank you for your presentation. We're gonna need a few hours to huddle and consider all this. Gentlemen, please be our guests in the Atlantis Lounge. We'll find you guys a nice, quiet corner... Maybe another night. Thank you. - I'll call you. - Please. Ike couldn't have done it better himself. I'll talk to vincent and Raskin and let you know. Thanks. It's gonna be okay. He'll be home by dinner. Taking into account your standing in the community, no priors, your net worth... How much? Klein is making an example. He won't back down from a million dollars. Hey, he tried to hold you without bail altogether. This is first-degree murder, Isaac. Get me out of here, Sid. Sure. You got $100,000 for the bondsman? I tried Lubow at the bank. I tried every-fucking-body. And I called your old man. Arthur offered to cash in his life insurance policy which, it turns out, lapsed in '44. Don't give up, Ike. I won't. I'll see you in the morning, my friend. How do I know it's bullshit? Florida State's Attorney doesn't arrest somebody for murder... Oh, Danny, for fuck's sake, you think Dad beat a professional hit man to death with a lead sap? That's what Klein said... with a lead sap? vincent's friend in Beach PD told him. Come on, it's all bullshit. What else did vincent say? Lobby floor. I'm seeing him now. Go tell Grandpa what's going on. If he sees this on Tv or something, he'll have a heart attack. Klein fucked up. He's gonna pay for it. So it's just her word against his. She swore under oath that she saw your pop kill this guy. Klein obviously thinks that her word will hold up. Maybe he's got some kind of physical evidence from the scene. Who the fuck knows? What can we do? Klein's got her stashed at the Biscayne Hotel. Bright and early Monday morning, they're gonna depose her in front of the grand jury. Then it's too late... the shit hits the fan. Judi's always been a stand-up girl, but she can put your old man away forever or worse. So, kid, what do you want to do? Yeah, I know the Biscayne. Good man. Dougie said she's in room 117. Yeah, he did. He also said that there's a shift change with the troopers guarding her at 11:00 p.m. every night. Our Doug will get you a passkey, distract the new guard for a few minutes. You visit Miss Silver and Bob's your uncle. Sounds simple. That's 'cause it is simple, Al. lt is simple. You want me to go tonight? Ben? Yeah. Tonight would be lovely. You hurt my feelings. The fucking help? Huh? You're dead. I'm gonna kill both of you. I'm gonna rip your skin off with my bare hands. He's a goddamn bartender! He fucked me, Ben. I couldn't get enough. He fucked me till I couldn't walk and then I crawled to him naked on all fucking fours and I begged him to fuck me some more. He fucked me in your car. We did it in your car, slipping all over those leather seats, baby. We were sliding around those leather seats. You were driving around sitting on the juices from my wet, hot cunt. Did he suck you? He sucked me. - He bit me. - Tell me more. Tell me more. I know what you like, baby. I know. I like it too. Let me give it to you. I can make it good for you. Oh, thank you, dear. Mommy, don't you think Daddy might be just a little bit suspicious? Get out. Ben Diamond has a favor. - Get away from me. - I'm not gonna hurt you. Ben wants you to write something for him. - Write something? - For Ben. Maybe he isn't suspicious, but I sure am. Now. Sorry, we're closed. I need to see you. I can't, not tonight. He took his boat out to the Keys. He's gone all weekend. We had a terrible fight. All right, I'll meet you at the Blue Mist. No, here. I sent everybody home. It's just us. Stevie, I want you in my bed. Uh, okay. Four, three, two, one. Never leave me. Never. So... here we are. Cigarette? Ike, I don't want you. We both know that. I want Ben Diamond. But, well, I have you. And make no mistake about it, my friend, I do have you. I've got an eyewitness who'll swear in court that she saw you beat Jimmy to death. And if that's not enough, I'll dig up some crime scene evidence with your prints all over them. Whatever it takes, I promise you, you will be convicted of first-degree murder. Good. You lie here and you think of something to help me convict the Butcher. And then you fucking pray it's good enough to get you out of here. Coerced testimony, fabricated evidence... that's what you have? That's your fucking case? I've sent men to the gas chamber on less.
