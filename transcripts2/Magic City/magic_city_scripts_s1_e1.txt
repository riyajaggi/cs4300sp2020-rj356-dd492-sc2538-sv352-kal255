 and I got 1,500 thirsty people coming in to see Sinatra tonight. - Get Stevie. - Okay. Unionize! Unionize! Unionize! Unionize! Unionize... You, new kid, come here. - What's your name? - Ray. Ray Mathis. Ray-Ray, put your hand here. Right here. - What do you feel? - I feel nothing. Exactly. Perfumed air is supposed to blow out of that nozzle 24 hours a day. Perfumed? What does it smell like? lt smells like the ocean and new money. - You get Cecil the engineer, okay? - Absolutely. Hey, you ever wonder why we keep it so cold in here? - No, sir. - Goddamn meat locker, right? So the ladies can wear their furs. That's our job, Ray-Ray. - We sell the dream. - Yes, sir. And, sir, it's just Ray.

Listen, smart-ass, heard you're having dog problems. Good news travels fast. - I still got a few friends. - I know. That's why I'm here. I was wondering and thinking that maybe you could talk to Al Strauss for me. I know he's retired, but his son Mikey, he's a union lawyer now. I think Mike would listen to him. Mikey's a pisser like the old man. The both of them are stubborn as hell. They won't back down. Can you just talk to Al for me? I gotta go meet Mike at Hoffman's. You handle it. You. Don't even think about going to your partners. Don't. Don't start, Pop. I don't have partners. The Miramar is mine. I see. And Benny Diamond is what, your new bellboy? And what brought him down from Chicago all of a sudden? He likes Sinatra. How the hell do I know? You know. You know. Don't expect any help from him. Those gonifs only help themselves, Isaac. I'll see you later, Pop. Isaac. Happy New Year. Yeah. Happy New Year, Pop. - ( elevator bell dings ) - ( laughing ) It'll be fun. Dad? ♪ I... ♪ ♪ Would do anything ♪ ♪ For ♪ ♪ Your love ♪ ♪ For your kiss... ♪ Who is it? Stevie. ls my dad here? At Hoffman's. He's in a breakfast meeting. Spare a cigarette? Sure. It's our secret. Ike thinks I quit. That's your business. If he calls, let him know I'm down at the Atlantis. Stevie? ls everything all right? You know, with the strike and tonight? Well, what did he say? - He says yes. - Then it is. Housekeeping. - Hey. - Hey. You're in a great mood. Yeah, well, I have to work tonight. On New Year's? Sinatra's playing downstairs. One of us owns the place, and the other one is a maid. You're a maid like I'm a cabana boy. - Your dad... - Works for your dad. I'll see you later. Be my date tonight. A date? - Like a date date? - Yeah. No, no. I don't know. Just come with me. What's the big deal? We're friends, right? Friends go do things. Right? Yeah, absolutely. I can't go anyhow. I'll get Stevie to change your shift. What? I don't have anything to wear. I'll see you at 8:00. Mike Strauss: You're the biggest. If you go, the whole strip will go. And I will go. We had two goddamn hurricanes this fall that cost me the High Holidays. I blew Christmas thanks to you. Now if I don't make good on Frank's New Year's run, it's over. You shut me down, Mike, then what? Then maybe the next guy runs an open shop, Ike. My people are happy, all right? I pay them better than any hotel on the beach. They don't want it, and I don't want it. I killed myself getting my own place. And now I'm gonna make you... make the union my partner? Let you tell me what I'm supposed to pay, how to run my hotel? I'll be out of business by summer. So who do you like in the Orange Bowl? We are talking about my goddamn survival, Mike. My hotel, my family. I will do whatever I have to do to stay alive. Do you hear me? You know what? Fine, fine. I pull my guys off the line till midnight, okay? That gives you the day, okay? That's the best I can do. Midnight? It's goddamn New Year's Eve, Mike. Sinatra starts his second show at midnight. What the fuck am I supposed to do in a day? Unionize. This could get ugly, Mike. lt will get ugly. Give Vera a squeeze for me. victor. Get Ricki. Have her do something at the cabanas or a fashion show bikini contest. Comp 'em the shit champagne, screwdrivers. Let's keep the lobby clear in case our friends come back. Wait a minute. The strike, they're coming back? No. I don't know. Stevie? You look like shit. As Grandpa always said, "You only go around once in life, and sometimes not even then." You do know that your grandfather's insane. You starting the usual early? I always hated New Year's, even as a kid. lt seemed like the only people having a good time were the tourists. Just couldn't compete with that. I guess I have my nose to the glass. They're back on at midnight. Can we stall and tell 'em we'll vote in the New Year? lt may get us through the night. Mike's too smart. He wants to hit us. Make an example. The whole town's watching the Miramar tonight. He wants to shut us down. How about this? How about no fucking way? Not tonight, not in my joint. You know who's upstairs in my goddamn hotel? - Mr. Frank Sinatra. - Francis Albert Sinatra in my presidential suite. Tonight he's walking out onto my stage in my hotel and he's ringing in my goddamn New Year. That sounds like a lot of fun. That sounds like a hell of a lot of fun. So basically, you got a warehouse full of booze sitting in Fort Lauderdale - and no way to get it in there. - Not until now. Where are you gonna find guys crazy enough to fuck with the union? Not crazy. Hungry. Champ. Thunder and lightning. Grady, tell my boy here what you told me. Some of the fellas, the boxers at the Sir John, if I ask them, they'll drive for y'all. lt could get messy. You pay cash, these guys will park your whiskey in the lobby. What are you waiting for? Right. Let's go, champ. Stevie, the Miramar doesn't hire dopers or felons. ( laughs ) I'll do my best. Man: It's your call. Smart move. Yeah, right off the lobby. We got a $1,000 limit on that game. ( knocks ) Bel, it's Ike. Sure, but if you got the juice you say, there's the cabana game tonight. Cabana one. Next to the ice machine. Yeah, all night. That game's no limit. Sure, right. Okay, fine. You let me know. If that momzer's got two nickels to rub together, I'm a Rockette. Hey, Ike, I'm dying here. It's like a morgue. I had to let Iggy go. Dead, no action. And it's the season, for Christ's sakes. I got ponies, dogs, jai alai. I got bupkes. What would you like me to do, Belvin? You know what you gotta do. You gotta talk to our friend. You gotta cut the head off this thing. You can't ask Francis Albert to walk through that circus tonight. Somebody's gonna get hurt. I heard they killed Vera's pup. Come on now. That's just wrong. Totally. All right, where is he? Now you're thinking. He just got back from his honeymoon. Ben divorced Doris? Kind of. She died in childbirth. Didn't Ben's first wife die in childbirth, too? Yeah, what are the odds? This new kid's a real beauty. Whew! Legs to here, like Cyd Charisse. Benny's smiling. - Now's the time to get him. - ( telephone rings ) - Good luck, kid. - Thanks, Bel. Sea Breeze Lingerie.

Please do something. ( man speaking Spanish on radio ) Oye! People, what the hell? Che has taken Santa Clara. Havana will be next. Maria's there. My Maria is there. Batista will never let Havana fall. It'll never happen. We'll get Maria on a plane tomorrow. I promise. We'll get her home. victor, I need your help out here. Come on. ( speaking Spanish ) Doorman: Mr. James. Boy: Grady James. Hey, champ. Grady James, can I get your autograph, please? Yeah, sure. Here. Here you go. Here we go. - Can you sign this for me? - No problem. Right here. Yeah. ( shouting ) Hey, junior, why don't you look around? - Give me five minutes with the fellas. - Sure.

Hey, did you guys see a really really pretty white girl come through here? ( laughs ) Not since Elizabeth Taylor was dogging Nat King Cole. ( laughing ) Forget about the girl, junior. You just tell us where and when. The cavalry has arrived. Woman: You can't have the McGuire## Sisters sitting all together. All right, fine, then put Phyllis between Danny Kaye and Jack Carter. - Daddy, I want Frankie Avalon. - Who doesn't, kid? Joanie Siegel had Frankie Avalon for her Bat Mitzvah. Lauren, honey, let's leave Daddy alone. He's working. Forget it. Just forget the whole thing. I hate you. I don't even want a damn Bat Mitzvah. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did you just say? Hey! Hey, did she just fucking curse? Get back here and apologize to your mother. - She's not my mother. - Lauren! Honey, it's okay. It's okay. She's just anxious. Oh. She's anxious? Well, they pick up on our stress. Our stress. Lose Jack Kennedy and the Lawfords. Why? They'll love sitting with Kim Novak. Lose Novak, too. Woman: What? That's a great table. lt took us two weeks... They canceled. All right, the strike's all over the news. We're bleeding here. ( groans ) We'll be fine. - Yeah, you say so. - I do. I'm not worried about one night, about some party. Six years ago, this was all just sand and mosquitoes. Now it's the Miramar Playa. You did that. - Marry me. - We're already married. Right, okay. Again. See how tonight goes. Shit, I gotta go. - What about lunch? - I'll grab something. Hey, who do you want at your table tonight? Um... Cary Grant and Sal Mineo. - You get Georgie Jessel. - Jerk. - Beauty. - ( dog growls, barks ) Look at her, honey, she's acting so weird. ( growls ) Won't come out when I call her. They pick up on our stress. - ♪ I wanna know ♪ - ♪ You oughta know, do you know? ♪ ♪ How it feels, I wonder how all of it feels ♪ - ♪ I wanna know ♪ - ♪ You oughta know, do you know? ♪ ♪ How it feels... ♪ ( sighs ) - Everything all right? - Yeah, why? Why? You, the beach? ls Bel's cabana game set for tonight? Yeah, I'm seeing him at 4:00. Oh, fucking sand. A necklace of bubbes. Stevie: That's what Mom used to call 'em. When you met Mom, saw her for the first time. I mean, was it like that thing, like in the movies where you just know, bang, she's the one? No. That came after. And it did happen. Your mother, Stevie, she was the love of my life, but not like that. Not that way. What you're talking about, that only happened with Vera. Do you know, the first time I saw v, I actually forgot how to breathe. You know that feeling? Congratulations, you poor son of a bitch. Hey, Stevie? Vera's everything to me. - Look, it's been crazy. - Make it work with her. After we get through tonight, everything will be cool. - Call me after you talk to Cuda. - Will do. Man: Okay, here's the drill. On stage, no flowers, no perfume. Jack and water on the piano. Shecky does a tight 15 to open, not a second more. Stick all the blondes in the front. Keep the air on high. - He likes it cold. - Done. Send him something light for dinner. Spaghetti marinara, no meat, like around 6:00, okay? And I'll send somebody up with our list - in about an hour. - Okay. Are we okay tonight? Okay? We are magic. Pure magic. 'Cause if he sees any empties, one empty seat, he walks. Square business, Ike. Frank is gone and you are done. You tell Frank there are no empties. - We are standing room only. - You better be. Thanks, Jilly. - ( buzzes ) - Get Mike Strauss for me now. ( intercom buzzes ) - Mike. - So did you come to your senses? You have to call off your strike till after Sinatra's run. I have to? I will revisit the union vote in a week. One week. I promise. You guys come back at midnight tonight and I am finished. That's the whole point, Ike. We strike when it hurts the most. I will lose everything. You know me, Mike. I'm not gonna let that happen. I will not let you do this. You know that sounds distinctly like a threat. It's the truth. Well, then, my friend, I guess we both do what our conscience tells us to do. Ike: Thank you. ( laughs ) Sorry. I soaked your shoes. Cooled me off. Ike Evans. Lily Augustine Diamond. It's a pleasure, Mrs. Diamond. Mr. Evans. Of course, from the Miramar. - You have a son, right? - Two, actually. Danny and Stevie. I hope I'll be seeing you at our Sinatra show tonight. Absolutely. I wouldn't miss it. Get your eyes back in your head. Come here. - Ben. - Ike. Sit down. Catch a few rays. Relax. So, Ben, I was sorry to hear about Doris. I'm still in mourning. Remember the day that you, me, and Do went out to the 'Glades, out to your quarry, and she looked into that hole, where you were digging out all that coral? - Limestone. - Limestone, right. Yeah, for your hotel lobby. She asked you how deep the water was. And you said... - Bottomless. - Bottomless. Bottomless. Parked a lot of cars down there, kid. Limestone. Coral. Marble. You spent a lot on that palace of yours, huh? What's your monthly nut over there? What do you owe? You know what I owe, Ben. Humor me. $65,000. A month? Every month? ( whistles ) And you come up with that? How about this month? How about right now? Have you got 65 Gs on you right now? I'm back two days, and already I hear you got union problems. I need your help tonight. I'd like you to talk to Mike Strauss. I'm not in the fucking union, so what do you want from me? Right. What'll it take? What do you want? The rest and a half. I want the rest. No. - What did you say? - I said no. - The Miramar is... - Mine! Mine. Fine. You take it. And you know what the Miramar is worth without me running it? It's a pile of sand, silverware, and towels. You get half of what you put in, but you take it... you fucking choke on it. Hey. Come here. You cut yourself. Jesus. You're very, very highly strung these days. You oughta relax. I'm serious. Why don't you go home? Kiss that pretty shiksa wife of yours for me. Have a drink. I'll see you later. Isaac. Did you ever hear the story about the frog and scorpion? No, Ben. The scorpion begs the frog to carry it across the river. And the frog says, "No, no. If I carry you, you'll sting me to death." And the scorpion says, "Oh, come on, Froggy. If I sting you, we'll both drown." So the frog lets the scorpion hop on its back. Halfway across the river, the scorpion whips his stinger into the frog's ass. While the frog is sinking and they're both gonna drown, the frog says, "But why? Why?" - You know what the scorpion says? - What? "It's in my nature." In the end, Ike, we are who we are. And I want more. That's what I've always wanted. I've always wanted more. Think about that as we swim across the river of life together. ( knocks on door ) - Hi, Stevie. - Ladies. - Welcome to the Miramar. - Thank you. Are you ready to meet the richest, best-looking, most famous guys in the world? - Yes. - Oh, yeah. You ready to meet millionaires and movie stars? You ladies are beauty. You're sex. You're every man's dream. And you are the Miramar Playa's gift to 1959. - You'll make us proud, girls? - Yes, sir. - Woman: All right. - Oh, make us rich. Bye, Stevie. Look what the cash dragged in. Granny. Judi, babe. Oh, Judi, babe. Behave or you'll work at a fun fair. Miss Silver, you kill me. Prove it, lover. "Never ride the working stock." - Ike Evans. - Oh, yeah. Cuda, get Miss Silver a very dry, a very cold gin martini - with two pearl onions. - Cuda: Got it. He remembers. Cuda: Stevie. I'm gonna need you for the night. I've been waiting my whole life to hear you say that. ( sighs ) How is everything? Are we okay? Mrs. Evans, we are beautiful. Por favor. Ugh! Cut it out. Can somebody get Fluffy off my sweater? - She's getting it all... - Fluffy? I'm not kidding. She keeps growling at me. Now she's really acting weird, honey. Come, babe. Hey, Lauren, if you're gonna keep wearing skirts that short, you better start shaving your legs. Dad. ( Judi laughs ) Man: Mmm! ( creaking ) Judi: Do you like that? ( Mike panting ) ( moaning ) - ( gun cocks ) - ( screaming ) No! Stop! No! No! Get off me! Somebody help! No, no! No! Get off! Oh, my God! Somebody help! Oh, my God! - ( jazz music playing ) - ( patrons chattering ) Fact or fiction? Somebody once told me that whatever you're doing at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve tells you what your whole year will be like. It's just 10:00. Well, it's midnight somewhere. Who are you? The wrong woman. Now you tell me. Are we good? Oh, yeah. Rousted a few local pickpockets and a couple of working girls from your causeway. Our friends from the Justice Department are here to count heads. Speaking of which, - I'll be around. - Thank you, vincent. ( Ben laughs ) Good night. - Don't mention it. - Where's the missus? Oh, powdering her nose. ( moaning ) - Dad, you know Mercedes. - Since birth. - You look beautiful, honey. - Thank you. What are you doing with this yutz, huh? - Hey, Dad. - Hey, kid. - Where's Stevie? - He'll show. Relax. You did it.
