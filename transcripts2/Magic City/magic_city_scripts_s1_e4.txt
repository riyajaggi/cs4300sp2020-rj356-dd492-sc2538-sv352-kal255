 Previously on "Magic City"... I'm losing my mind here. Maria's... I've got half of Havana working on it. We'll get her out. I hope. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to find somebody who can. Sweetie, if I didn't know any better, I would think you were fucking the gardener. ( moaning ) You got something you wanna tell me? I'm sorry. I don't know what... Some yutz has been hitting suites from the fucking balconies.

 Ben Diamond is back in Miami, playing cards at the Miramar. If we want Ben Diamond, we go through the Miramar lobby. A hundred grand. Work that Evans charm on those shit-kickers. I will never lend my name to your casino gambling. Ann Strauss: I know that you didn't have anything to do with Mike. You loved him. I know why he loved you. ( music playing ) Man: A lawyer who gets out from behind his desk, grabs a sign, and stands shoulder to shoulder with the rank and file... Mike Strauss. How about a union lawyer who doesn't take a payoff?

 Can you picture that? A lawyer who doesn't have his hand out. Will not sell out his brothers. That was Mike Strauss. Mike was a good man. A real good man in a hard world. Mike was... he was family. He will be missed. My boy... my boy Mike had a hard head. Stubborn as hell. Mikey never gave up. ( doors open ) - ( clamoring ) - Man: Florida State's Attorney. We are remanding the body of Michael Alan Strauss to the Dade County coroner as material evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation. No. No. - My son. - Leave him alone. Ike! Stevie, get out. Hey, we are burying him today. No, he's returning to the Dade County coroner today - for further autopsy. - You did an autopsy. It's over. You had his body for weeks. New forensic tests have been ordered. He's got no case. He's got no suspects. Nothing. This is all about ass-saving. This is all about Jack Klein. No, this is all about the law. Now if you'll excuse me. Leave him alone. Finally leave him! ( crying ) Tell Klein I'm coming. - Your right as a taxpayer. - You should leave now. Come on. Man: All the way down. Hey, you can't stall forever. They teach you this shit in law school? - Get Raskin in my office. - Done. Klein's coming after Dad. You see that, right? I see the D.A. doing his job, trying to solve a murder. Why would the Florida State's Attorney come after Dad? Free Sinatra tickets? And that's the law? Man: That is the law, but more importantly, he is the law. Klein is the Florida State's Attorney. Isaac, he's a prince of the court. Not some grifter trying to steal a hotel ashtray. He just stole Mike Strauss out of fucking temple. lt was well within the D.A.'s rights. - He has an ongoing investigation. - ( cracking ) Sid, put down the fucking walnuts and get Mike back. Make an appeal, file a motion, some fucking thing. My hands are tied here. He can keep Mike on ice forever. - It's Klein's courthouse. - I'm getting Mike back. You better start tunneling. And as your attorney, I don't wanna hear about that. I'm sorry. Mike... ( speaks Yiddish ) was a good guy. He deserves his final rest. Good luck. I want you to call the kid at "The Herald." The ad guy, the photographer? The writer. How's everything, folks? How's the soup? - Good. Thank you. - Enjoy it. How are you? Good evening. ( speaking Spanish ) Maria's my wife. I can't just sit around and not do anything. - But she's okay. - So far. Yes, fine, safe, but with her parents. A lot of her friends are disappearing into the Morro. I want her home. Don't worry. I'll set up a meeting with these people - at the barbershop. - ( speaks Spanish ) Now get back to work. Please, you have the body of an 11-year-old gymnast. - A sexy 11-year-old gymnast. - Thank you, I guess. Seven, bam. No guessing, you are so lucky you still have your real body. Ike's got three beautiful kids. He's probably finished with the baby tours. No, we want a family, our own family. How long has it been? Has what been? - That you've been trying. - Rachel. What? No, that's okay. We've only been married four years. Only? I popped out two by then. You're still in the sex- for-fun phase. As opposed to what? Sex for money? Don't knock it. - ( whispers ) Mr. Powers is... - Three flowers. Great. Thanks, Ray-Ray. Ladies, lunch is on me. Order whatever your stretch marks will allow. I'll be back. Gypsy bitch. I'll just have an iced coffee. Woman: Yes, I will. Absolutely, Mr. Kaye. First thing. My pleasure. Yes, he will be thrilled. Danny Kaye wants Ike to install a full Chinese kitchen when he plays the Triton. - Meshuggeneh. - Great. ls he inside? Mnh-mnh. Meeting downtown. Damn it. He promised he'd talk to Dave Powers... Jack Kennedy's guy. He's in Atlantis right now. - It's unbelievable. - ( telephone rings ) Sorry, hon, anything I can do? No, no, it's okay. I'll handle him. Thanks. Ike Evans' office. Can I help you? Mr. Powers? Vera Evans, Ike's wife. Of course, Mrs. Evans. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, ma'am. I know that you and the senator are good friends of the Miramar Playa, and I finally wanted to introduce myself. I wonder, would you have a second to talk? Sure, of course. Stevie, could I please have a coffee? Absolutely. So the family's up in Palm Beach? Yep, for a few weeks. Lovely spot. A bit boring, though. - Boring? - Well, it seems the senator is with us nearly every weekend. lt is a beautiful spot you have here, Mrs. Evans. Ike and the senator are friends and, obviously, whenever Mr. Sinatra is here... Thanks. Yes, my husband has built quite a playground. Senator Kennedy has enjoyed some unforgettable nights with us. Mrs. Evans, is there some way I can be of help? Something, some charity I can bring to Senator Kennedy's attention? Oh, thank you, but I would never wanna be one of those people. Please, you and Ike are family. Well, actually, there is something. Mrs. Kennedy, Jacqueline, has agreed to cohost a B'nai B'rith luncheon with me next month. The invitations went out with both of our names, and a couple of weeks ago, she cancelled. A schedule conflict. Pretty embarrassing as you can imagine. I've tried to reach her social secretary. My private number. Let me know where and when the event is, and I will personally do my best to see that Mrs. Kennedy attends. Really? That would be wonderful for our organization. Mrs. Evans, you would have made a great politician's wife. Or a politician. Please, give your husband my best. ( sighs ) Jack Klein: "As you know, Governor, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America has special meaning for me primarily because"... is it "has" or "have"? April, you just clean it up, okay? What? - Ike Evans is downstairs. - He's here now? I practically spilled coffee on him in the lobby. He's on his way up with some young hotshot lawyer. - This should be fun. - You want me to call a trooper? Please, I put Trigger Mike Coppola and half the Purple Gang in prison. Think I'm afraid of a cranky hotel owner? I want Mike Strauss's body. Have we met? - You know that's not gonna work. - What won't work? Keeping Mike here. It's not gonna force anybody to talk. It's not gonna do anything except destroy a good woman and a nine-year-old boy. Here's what I suggest you do. You take your attorney and your sudden and touching concern for widows and orphans, go back to that ridiculous wedding cake you call a hotel and put on a show or something. Let the grownups handle the rest. He's not an attorney. He's the crime writer for "The Herald." Bill Patrick. We've actually met. I'd love to get an official rebuttal to Mr. Evans' allegations. Why don't I leave you kids to it? Mr. D.A., a pleasure. Bill, be sure to ask the junior crime-fighter here what more he can wring out of a twice-autopsied, three-week-old corpse. And ask Mr. Evans one question for the people of the state of Florida. - Which is? - Who had motive? Who benefitted from Mike Strauss' death? That's two questions. ( speaks Spanish ) ( Spanish spoken on radio ) ( speaking Spanish ) ( speaks Spanish ) - I'm Tony. - Hi, Tony. ( speaking Spanish ) - Salud. - Salud. Maria's still in Cuba. - These are bad times. - Sí. ( speaks Spanish ) My boss, my friend Ike Evans has been trying to get her out, but I need help. Man: Pierce Fuller. Double Check Corporation. We're an investment firm interested in a free Cuba. ( speaks Spanish ) You work at Miramar Playa? General manager. Vic, no family should be broken up like this. I can't imagine it. You've a daughter, right? - That's correct. - So do I. This is... it's unacceptable. Tell me, has Maria applied for an exit permit? She filled out one last week. Does she have any special technical skills the Cuban government would value? She's a housewife. Any ties to Batista or his family? No. Yes. Her father cut the man's hair. He was Batista's personal barber? Only Luis for 30 years. Castro is holding anyone close to Batista under "crimes against the revolution." It's okay, vic. Maybe we can help. Let me get into this for you. Really? I can pay. If you need money, I have some. Alberto has all your information, right? Yes, of course. We're going to need your wife's family's address in El Vedado, huh? ( speaks Spanish ) Your Maria will be home and safe soon. You'll see. That's it? We're done? We're done. Thank you. It's a fairy tale. So what? It's supposed to be incredible. No, "House on Haunted Hill" is supposed to be incredible. "Sleeping Beauty" actually has the word sleeping in it. It's not a good sign. Well, I saw the poster, and you kind of look like Prince Charming. Don't try to butter me up. How much like Prince Charming? Sit down and shut up. I'll be a second, and then we can go. Great. Choose between a cartoon and a real movie, and my girl wants to see the cartoon. So I'm your girl? You know what I mean. No, explain it to me. What are you doing here? Mercedes. Mercedes: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. What... ( gasps ) Papi. What the hell's going on? This boy's watching you change? This boy? It's just Danny. victor, can I please explain? No, she explains. You stay quiet. ( speaking Spanish ) I was just going to a movie, all right? I was just taking off my uniform. - I think you should leave us. - Okay, yeah, I'll... - No, Danny. - Mercy, I'll call you later. - Please. - It's better. It's fine. See you later, victor. Listen, I have good news. Mercedes! ( whistles ) Nice. We took care of that thing. - The feygeleh did himself. - A mitzvah. And the other thing. - The whore, she's gone? - Anytime now. Not you two. Nobody local. Izzy sent somebody from Golden Valley. I don't want some sloppy Polack with a bat. No, Jimmy Shoes. You know Shoes. He's the best. We're good. Yeah, so good luck with them snappers. Hey, Dandy, come here. My shrimp strikes out, I'm gonna put a hook through your belly, see where you catch me. ( laughing ) Okay, fine. Go. Your index finger's longer than normal. - Means I'm hung? - Nice. lt means you're a leader. I do like to be on top. You are artistic, reckless and wild. You can tell all that from my finger? No. It's just what I know. What? Your fate line. You're going on vacation. What are you doing, Stevie? Hmm? What do you want from me? Nothing. Oh, now that's a lie. Don't you have a client coming in at 6:00? I'll let Myrnna have him. I feel a cold coming on. See? I'm feverish. You know what this is, right, what it would be? ( scoffs ) Are you gonna worry it to death, Stevie? Or are you finally gonna fuck me? Cuda. I'm taking Miss Silver to see the doctor. Call Myrnna. Tell her to take Judi's 6:00, huh? - Feel better, Jude. - Oh, I will. ( knocks ) - Igg. - Mr. Ike. Good to see you. Bel. - ( telephone rings ) - Bel: Back here. No, I'm not gonna fucking describe the... Jesus, okay. Two spics in helmets throw a fucking rock at each other and you bet on who catches it. Hicks. Great. You are now a jai alai fan. You looking for a peignoir for v? ls the Whiner still in your big game? Yeah, the fuckface complains even when he wins. He's in tonight. Why? He's still the governor's chief of staff, right? He's way up the big guy's ass. I want him to lose. - How big? - Big. ( laughs ) My pleasure. - Thanks, bro. - You sure about that lady? Huh? We got some very chic shit, just in from Paris, France. No, I'd definitely lose the wig. You lose your wig. Fuck you. This is real. It's the bitch's trademark. You buy Judi Silver, you get the platinum. Judi? Excuse me. Judi Silver? - That's me, handsome. - Oh. Miss Silver, sir, drink? Whatever you'd like, sweetie. No, I think... well, maybe. I mean... - Do you have a car, lover? - Rental, yes. It's a Mercury Cruiser. I had you pegged as a Mercury man the second I saw you. Really? Actually, I drive a Chevy Bel Air back home, but... And where's home, shug? ( moaning ) Where are you, lover? ( panting ) I'm here. I'm right here. You're with her. It's okay, baby. You think about her, but you fuck me. What? Dangerous. If I'm dangerous, what's Ben Diamond? - God. - Huh. I've never fucked a god before. Not a god. Right. God. What's this? Your human sacrifice. Rip my heart out and eat it. I am yours. ( panting ) Maybe I should sleep downstairs tonight. Would you like that? Yes. I would. ( panting ) ( grunting ) He was naked? Stark naked. Just lying there on the bed. Oh, yeah, there was these $20 bills on top of him. What did Lucy do? She just continued vacuuming. I mean, you gotta finish your shift, right? You clean Stevie's room? I thought that was Mildred's job. I clean your room, too. You better hide those dirty magazines somewhere else. Stevie, are you decent? Just in case he's lying naked. - ( grunts ) - Oh, my God. Danny! Danny! Somebody please help! Somebody help! Help! Danny, Danny, Danny, wake up, wake up. ( woman speaking indistinctly on P.A. ) We used to go to Crandon Park before you guys were born. Cape Florida. She liked me to read her poetry. Do you believe that? She'd lie in my lap, her eyes closed, and I'd read to her. The sound of the waves, sometimes a lion would roar from the zoo. lt could have been anywhere. She looked just like her boy. Just like her. ( sighs ) I'm sorry. You will have to leave now. I don't think so. He's going to be fine. He just needs his sleep. Tell Dr. Bobby that I'm staying. It'll be okay. I'm gonna be here when my son wakes up. I'm sorry, sir, but hospital regulations forbid... I'm not leaving my son. You should go check on vic and Mercedes. And if V's still in the waiting room, you should tell her to go home. I'm gonna stay here. She should go check on Lo. Lo will be upset. Okay. You should go home, too. One of us needs to be at the hotel. There's too much going on. I'll send Cuda with some coffee and sandwiches. He's gonna be okay, right? He's okay. I know. I can't believe this. In my own place. That poor boy. I'll never forgive myself. Woman over P.A.: Dr. Cohn to X-ray. Dr. Cohn to X-ray. Tell me. He's good. He's good. He's sleeping. No surgery. He's gonna be okay. It's okay. It's okay. He's gonna be fine. Are you kidding? He'll be dining out on this forever. Lucky, so lucky. - Ike's staying here. - Of course. Thinks maybe you should go home and be with Lo. Right. Stevie, is he really okay? vic's right. We're lucky. - He's such a sweet boy. - He is. I'm gonna go say good night. Will you give me a ride home after? - Yeah, sure, I'll be here. - Okay. I've never seen anybody yell at anybody, and there I was. She wouldn't take any drugs, wanting to do everything natural. Now if you knew your mother very well, you would know that to be the case. We sat there and we sang. I don't remember the song anymore... Mrs. Evans. - How about a drink? - I'd love one. I thought you were after his money. He goes to Cuba for a weekend. He comes back two weeks later with a dancer from the Tropicana, and I'm supposed to what? Trust that? Trust you? And... And? And... you're you. Beautiful. Crazy beautiful, pretty much my age. - Older. - Not older enough. I mean, you're his wife, right? My father's wife, but... But? But I'm me. Look, I love my father. And so do I. I believe that. lt feels... it seems like we have all this time to just, you know, lead these lives, these days just stretching out, but I swear to you, Stevie, we don't. We don't. We have to try and speak the words. We have to try even if it's hard. Maybe especially if it's hard. Try with the people we love, with our family. 'Cause it's all... it... it goes. What? Spoken like a mom. God, I'm sorry. No, no, no. Molly. It's me. Meg, I'm sorry. I thought... Hi. Ike, he looks just like her. Like you both. ls he okay? Yeah. He's got a hard head just like his pop. ( laughs ) I'm glad you came. Family. - ( panting ) - ♪ I'm cold as ice... ♪ ( music continues indistinct ) ♪ Now I've got my love... ♪ ( gunshot ) ( dog barking ) ( gasping ) ( whimpering ) ( screams ) ( music continues ) ♪ I feel ♪ ♪ So good ♪ ♪ Like I... ♪ Yeah, absolutely, he swung with his right. So we got a right-handed spider monkey that can climb a 15-story building and jump out the window. ls he hitting anyone else? Fontainebleau? - Just you. - Lovely. Maybe he's somebody we know, knows the hotel. We'll pull all your employment records for the last year or so. How you feeling, kid? Like I stayed up drinking with him. You look worse. Thanks. You seen Mercy? She stayed in the waiting room all night. victor made her go home when the sun came up. See? Always a silver lining. Can I talk to you for a second, Pop? Yeah. No nightclubbing for you. Be right back. Myrnna and some john from St. Augustine got shot last night. - Jesus. Dead? - Yeah. Pro hit. Twice to her head, not a trace. Who would want Myrnna dead? They thought she was Judi Silver. See, Myrnna took Judi's date. Myrnna was wearing a wig, a platinum wig like Judi. The shooter thought she was Judi. Dad, what the fuck's going on? I mean, we set Judi up with Mike. I did. I put her in that room. Now Mike's dead, and poor Myrnna... Stay with Danny, all right? Clear everybody out. Your brother needs his rest, then you meet me at the hotel. Does Judi... should I call... No, you don't do anything. Ike, they tortured me. Ike, I'm a dead man. - Not now, Whiner. - I'm down 20 large. I got cards you wouldn't wipe your ass with for nine fucking hours. I lost 30 straight hands. What's that? You calling Bel's game fixed? No, no! Jesus, Ike. I don't have that kind of money. - I'm a civil servant. - With two broken legs. Jesus, Ike. Please, you could talk to him. You could buy me some time. I'm your servant, Ikey. Can you get your guy to get Klein to release Mike Strauss' body? The governor? Only if I ask. And you'll get me a month. Two weeks? Jesus. Two fucking weeks! No. Okay, all right. Right now. I'll call him right now, and you'll... As soon as I have Mike, but, Whiner, you listen... No, no, no, I quit. I'm done, all right? You won't see me at the game anymore. I love you, Isaac. Thank you. That little prick was crying so hard, he blew snot all over the cards. ( sighs ) Ben, we need to talk. Yeah, sure. Sit down. You gotta get some sun. Stuck in that hole the whole night. Did I ever tell you that I grew up in an orphan home in Philly? lt was dark, cold, and a mean place. Orthodox, too. I never got to see the sun, not even in the summer. lt was like a Jewish dungeon. You killed the wrong girl last night. Killed? I was playing cards. Your shooter thought it was Judi Silver 'cause she was wearing Judi's wig. You killed the wrong whore. That's why God made extra bullets. Judi can't hurt you. She doesn't know anything. Don't do this, Ike. lt demeans both of us. - You know how this works. - I can't let you kill her. I won't. - You won't? - She didn't see anything. The D.A. disagrees. He pulled her in. He's fishing, Ben. She gave nothing to Klein. I will vouch for her. I will. You'll vouch for her? Like I give a shit. Again, you come to me for a favor and again you offer me nothing in exchange. What's my incentive? How much? A piece of your arcade rentals. Every shop? 10% of my cut. If I wasn't so comfy, I'd slap you. - 13%. - 15%. 15% of every shop you've got. And the girl lives. She's a hooker. It's a dangerous profession. Now some john could come at her with a broken Coke bottle. The bitch will not die by my hand. Okay. And God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son to prove his devotion to the Lord. Abraham ties the young little boy to an altar, draws his knife to slaughter the child. Then an angel appears and says, "Just kidding, Abe. lt was a test, and you passed." Do you know who Abraham's poor little boy was? Isaac. The first little Isaac. I wonder if you'll get a heavenly pass this time, too. lt ends now, Ben. Nobody else dies.
