 kill James Clayton that night. I lied. Sy, it's Lily. No. No. Sy. Sy, if he finds out, he'll kill me. - I'm no use to you dead. - ( line clicks ) Vera Evans, the queen of the Miramar Playa, formerly the queen of the Tropicana, dances again. V, could you? Castro closed down the casinos, the hotels? The Riv, the Capri, Nacional... they used to print money. Now... graveyards. Here is my offer to Fidel: Ike Evans from the world-famous Miramar will come in and run his hotels.

 I am offering Sy Havana. All he's got to do is get Ben Diamond out of the Miramar. Isaac, you've forgotten who you can and who you cannot disrespect. And that is a fool's amnesia. And so it begins. So it begins. ( theme music playing ) ( people chattering ) ( phone rings ) Sy: So, look, you bury 'em deep... right up to their necks. You make 'em believe it's winter. Take a seat, Ben. Sit down. Here's what you... you put 'em in a refrigerator two or three months. Then when you take 'em out, they think it's spring, tra-la, and they grow. So you're tricking tulips? Yeah, I know. I used to trick showgirls. Now I trick a fucking flower. Either way, I don't get laid. Getting old sucks, buddy. But... apparently that's not... that's not a problem for you... getting old. It's not gonna be one, right? He goes. Hmm? The fucking DA's after him. No. The fucking DA is after you. My guy tells me the gambling bill is a lock. - Mm-hmm. - The moment it passes, Ike is irrelevant. He's a hotel guy. He doesn't know shit about casinos. That's true, but he's our hotel guy. We can make more money on the floor in one night... We'll take this up again, I promise, after the bill passes. Bullshit. What the fuck did I fly up here for? I'm still talking, Benny. Ike stays until the bill passes. Ike lives. Do what the fuck I ask you to do, Benny. Truth is, I'm too tired to fucking argue. Okay? And I'm also getting too tired protecting your ass. Protect me? Protect me from what? From who? Our friends tell me that your skim is too deep. And they got proof. And that you're putting out too much... - Liars. Fucking liars. Fucking... - Shh, shh, shh. Stop. You know, ever since you were a kid, your eyes... they were always bigger than your stomach. I know you, kid. You're a fucking pelican. So listen. There's a lot of things... crazy, fakakta things... that were, what? Overlooked. Because, month after month, you brought in that big Cuban cash. Now all our friends are getting impatient. And they're watching. And they're watching you, you putz. I mean, for once in your life, be smart. Send up a decent cut. Do not be greedy. Do not kill our partners. I'm not a 12-year-old pisher hanging around a fucking candy store, Sy. If those jealous pricks think I'm lying... Shut up. You hear me? That's enough. Hey. This Nicky Grillo... what... what is he doing visiting Santo in Havana five times in the last two months? And he bought a warehouse in Hialeah. Why is that? He's fucking Santo's boy. Who gives a fuck? I do. I give a fuck. And so should you. I mean, he bought property in your fucking backyard. Look, here I am in this stupid fucking greenhouse in the middle of Wilmette, and I heard about it. Now, the old Benny D... he would want to know, what is he doing out of Tampa? Why is he over here in Miami? So maybe, just maybe, if you got your face out of that mermaid's cooze and look around for ten seconds... Who told you Lily was a mermaid? - Who told me? - Yeah. Fucking King Neptune. I mean, wh... it was you. It was you. You told me, "I had to marry her when I heard she sucked the hose," or some stupid fucking thing. It was you. You all right, kid? You happy? - I mean, you and the girl. - Lily. Her name's Lily. Lily. Excuse me. Lily. Happy? Fucking Howdy Doody's happy. I'm... contented. That's close enough. Come here. I want you to give this to your Lily. Tell her it's from me for giving my Benny peace of mind. - Thank you. - Yeah. Wow, lilies. Not half as gorgeous as you two, but what is? What's the occasion? The Jews escaped slavery in Egypt. A Seder. Tomorrow night. You're the worst Jew in Miami. - I get to drink wine. - Yeah. Well, I guess that means you'll have finished your homework? Apparently I should spend more time in jail. You should spend more time telling me the truth. Excuse me? Everyone always thinks that we're the liars, we're the thief, you know... the gypsy. It's funny, because we are taught as babies that the gadjo, the whites, tell the biggest lies. What are you talking about, V? Meg is your new partner? Some bank or something owns half of this hotel, of our home? I have to sit like a fool in front of Meg - and all the others and hear... - Stop. V. V, you chose to be in that meeting, to be involved. And I'm glad you were. You were good at it. But up until, what, two days ago, you had no interest in this. What hurts you hurts me. That is what I thought. Talk to me. Trust me. I can help or at least listen. Maybe... maybe I can take some of this pressure from you. Or I can try. I had the land, 15 acres on the beach, mine. I knew that it was a great bet. And I figured that once I broke ground, every bank in town would line up to loan me whatever I needed to build. I was wrong. Molly's dad... he owned them all, the banks, sat on every board, controlled anyone that had any real money in this town, shut me down. He forbid anyone to loan me a dime. Then he was gonna sweep in and grab his land back and show his little girl how right he'd been about the Jew boy that... Who is the Minneapolis Mutual Investment Corporation? Why are you asking me this? What is the question behind the question, V? Do you trust me? I am asking you right here, right now, do you trust me? I come from a world that believes that lying to succeed and lying to make money is a virtue. Do you understand? And I come from a world that believes you protect the people you love. Do you understand? - No matter what? - No matter what. ♪ If you want some lovin', yeah ♪ ♪ Then I'll give it to you ♪ ♪ Yes, yes, to you ♪ ♪ If you want some huggin', yeah ♪ ♪ I can hug some too ♪ ♪ Yes, yes, some too ♪ ♪ Oh!

Let's get out of here. - ( insects chirping ) - ( distant train horn blowing ) Lazy spade pays out 10 fucking Gs on the wrong numbers... Saturday numbers. Then he's at a goddamn show living it up. - You all right, kid? - Fine. Yeah, I'm fine. Here's a tip... want to help out a pal, sneak in quiet. The "What's going on?" move tends to distract, makes him vulnerable to, I don't know, a fucking wine bottle? But, hey, it's the thought that counts, boychik. How does he pay the wrong fucking numbers? - ( engine starts ) - You listen to the radio. They announce Cuban National Lottery winner, and you write down the numbers. - ( train wheels clacking ) - You pay four, six... ( trails off ) ( gun clicks ) ( tires screech ) Oh-ho-ho. Oof. Whew. It's hard to believe, but that schvartze's not so bad. He had a gun. He was gonna shoot us. A cokehead, but not a bad guy. Maybe getting shot will be a wake-up call. ( laughs ) Hey, get some sleep. Tomorrow's a brand-new day, right? Ike: We gotta get the word out, Solly, all right? Vera Cruz, in the main room. Pack the place. ( intercom buzzes) - Florence: Mr. Raskin is here. - Send him in. The best of Cuba, exclusive to the Miramar Playa. When I'm done, people will kill for tickets. The only way to get good ones... - book a room. - ( laughs ) Thank you, Solly. - Solly. - Sid. Sid. Your passport, back from the DA. Thank you. Cuba? I left word for Rafael Menendez at the Riv... - I don't want to know. - Fine. All right, I want to know. When are you going? It's gonna work, Sid. I know it. Absolutely. What could possibly go wrong? You con Castro, you fuck over the Chicago outfit, and you throw the Butcher out of your hotel. You and Ruthie... sitting at my table for V's opening night. If we're not sitting shiva after your funeral. Isaac, Ben is a shark. No. Ben is not a shark. He is a remora, a suckerfish. He lives off the shark's scraps, what the shark hunts. He is a fucking parasite. I build. I create. Sid, I am the fucking shark. ( panting ) Tell me. - ( thunder rumbling ) - ( rain pattering ) The guy... the guy that hit me... I shot him. What? - You what? - He was about to shoot Bel. - Stevie... - I saw everything... his finger on the trigger. Then I picked up Bel's gun. There was so much time, so slow. So scary. That's the thing: I don't feel anything. It's okay. You just sleep now. We got all night. ( thunder rumbling ) You just sleep, baby. ( birds chirping ) I don't know how the fuck Sy knew Grillo was in town. Nicky fucking Grillo in my backyard, b-buying warehouses, moving merch in Miami? Nicky must have just snuck down from Tampa. Stop! Shit! Fucking Sy knew. Fucking Sy knew, and I didn't? - ( shouts ) - ( screaming ) Fucking idiot. I want you to personally find out what Grillo's up to in Hialeah. - You hear me? - Yeah, sure. Invite him to my Seder. I want to talk to him. I'm not having Chicago getting into my shit, telling me how to run my business, run my town. And they're not fucking telling me who lives and who fucking dies. Now get out of here. A fucking mess. Not bad. I see you have a lighting grid. Dressing rooms? A sound system? Of course. We have everything. Now the question is, can we be ready by Memorial Day? Cesar: It's a complicated show, very demanding. Vera: Oh, but I thought you had your dancers. The chorus. But do I have my lead? You don't think I can do it? Can you? These last few years, have you rehearsed four hours a day, have you danced ten shows every week? If you don't think I can do it, just say so. I don't think you can do it. But we shall see. Help an old man down? Gracias. Vera: I'll see you tomorrow? Cesar: Why not? Hasta mañana. Hasta mañana. - ( distant banging ) - ( men conversing ) Spying on me? Imagining is more like it, seeing you dance again. Wait till you see my costume. Ooh. I have an idea. Why don't we go upstairs and you give me a private fashion show? I have to go finish my gefilte fish. What? Nothing. I have to go out of town tomorrow... a short trip, just some business. - A trip? Where? - Havana, just for the day. Is it safe? Safe as milk. There's a few showgirls I need to check out. I want to look at some hotel properties. Are you really going to check out the dancers at the Trop? I have the queen of the Trop right here. And she makes gefilte fish. Don't you forget it, mister. Never. Okay. Come upstairs. - I need those big hands. - Oh. Done. - To make matzo balls. - ( laughs ) - Mr. Rivas. - "Mr. Rivas"? Antonio, Victor, por favor. Come on. No. El Tiburon. You're all set. Ray-Ray will show you your suite. - Antonio. - Victor. Victor Lazaro. Maria Lazaro was your wife? Yes. I was there. I was shot there. - I was with her that night. - With Maria? I didn't know her, of course. We were all strangers. Nobody spoke, waiting in the dark, for the boat, you know? The signal came. Then we walk out, waist-deep in the water. Your wife was behind me, at the end. She, my friend, spoke your name three times in the end. Three times she said your name. I'm... I'm glad she didn't die alone. But I... I have to ask for your forgiveness. - My forgiveness? - The ambush... Castro's soldiers... they were sent to kill me. - Your wife died because... - No. That is not your fault. Her body is still in Cuba. We can't do a mass, can't put her to rest. I have to go bring her back. Then Mercedes is an orphan, all right? You can't step foot in Cuba. Maria is lying there, somewhere, in some room alone... my wife, Ike. - I have to go. - He's right. Neither you nor your wife will return. I will bring her back, Vic. I will. I can give you some names there... good people. I think I have a way. We'll bring her home, okay? Okay. ( distant dog barking ) ( knocks on door ) Danny: Mercy, it's me. Hi. I look awful. I've seen worse. - Nourishment. You need strength. - I'm not hungry. Hey, I was in pre-law, okay, which is almost like premed. Now what would you say is the food group that would give a beautiful young girl... woman... the healthiest, most nutritious boost? - You're nuts. - ( imitates buzzer ) Time's up. If you guessed Polynesian food, you are right. Egg rolls, barbecued ribs... ( drums on table ) and... crab rangoon. Come here. Come here. I know it's impossible. I remember. But you hang on. Sometimes barely, but you do. You got to say good-bye. ( sighs ) I don't think that's necessarily much better. You know? At the end, she wasn't my mom anymore. I don't know. I know. Come here. I know, okay? She loved you. She was so proud of you. She loved that you were following your dream. I quit. I quit Pan Am this morning. - Why? - My father needs me, Danny. He's, like, walking around like a zombie, staring at my mom's pictures, talking to himself. He's so lost. He needs me. I can't leave him. Okay. Hey, it's okay. Listen, thanks for the food. I got, you know, like, chores and things before my dad gets back, so... You know what's so crazy? That day... that day, before... I was the happiest I've ever been in my life. It'll be good again. Will it? Yeah. I'll make it good again. Okay? I promise. - I'll call you tonight. - Okay. Eat the food. ( two knocks ) Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Thank you for coming. I need a favor. You promised me that you would get Maria Lazaro's body home. No. I said I would try. Mr. Evans, I'm just a concerned businessman. Let's cut the bullshit, Pierce. I don't have time. I know you're a spook. FBI, CIA... frankly, I could give a shit. My friend is going insane. He deserves to bring back his wife to bury her. He needs to bury his wife. Castro murdered an innocent woman... an innocent woman married to an American, a mother. Do you think Fidel wants her body in the States, bullet holes counted, a martyr, a rallying cry for all his enemies? The press would be catastrophic. And just as we're trying to get him to lend us... Her ashes. I will bring back her ashes. A priest in Havana could perform final mass before they cremate her. Can you do that, Pierce? Can you get me her ashes? Havana is a difficult place these days, even for us. Do you know El Tiburon? He fought with Fidel in the mountains. He was... is a hero to the Cubans here, thinks Castro's going Communist. He fled Havana a few days ago. I just checked him into my hotel. But I'm sure you boys know all that. As of this minute, Castro's not a US enemy. He's the recognized leader of a sovereign state. Any attempt to violently overthrow him would be frowned upon. - Officially. - Officially. You get me Maria's remains, and I will let you bug Tiburon's suite in my hotel, make sure he's not hurting Fidel. Call me. But do it soon. My advice... don't go. We won't be able to protect you there. You can't protect me here. Mercedes: Papi, lunch is ready. ( knocks ) Papi, ven aqui. It's getting cold. Coming! Yeah, I'm coming! ( quiet music playing ) This child's strong hands come from wringing chicken necks and beating laundry on rocks in her native land. Humor me, Senator, please. ( senator groaning ) Sweet mother of God. ( senator laughs ) And after the gambling bill goes through the house this month... With whatever bullshit amendments those boys stick to it, it comes back to us in the Senate. Now if you were to give us some more grease for the legislative wheels and... - And you deliver the Senate vote. - A mere formality at this point. Your bill passes on its first vote, and my dear, dear friend the governor signs it into law. And the heavens shower us with gold. - Amen. ( chuckles ) - Amen. Sugar, I think it's time we basted this bird on the other side, all right? Oh, yes. Yeah, like that. That's right. Go ahead. ♪ You I love ♪ ♪ The kind of passion you fashion ♪ ♪ Cannot be explained ♪ ♪ You I love... ♪ Trouble in paradise? Judi. Wow. How are you? Wow. How am I? Great. Really great, Stevie. Thanks for asking. And you? How is it fucking the Butcher's wife? Looks, well, feisty. Jesus, Judi, you want to get me killed? Hmm, is that a trick question? Get it? Trick question? You know, a girl could get a lot of back rubs with info like that. Don't play. Do not play with this. You're hurting me. Come on. I was kidding. Shit. Thank you. You were really stand-up in court, you know, taking on Klein like that. He's a scary guy. Jesus. What part of a secret grand jury doesn't fly in this town? ( sighs ) I'm glad to see you. I'm glad you're okay. Then show it. Find me a client. Got bills to pay, honey. Beauty supplies. Tommy Kornreich. He dropped a wad in here like a baby's fist last night. - Hmm. - He's from Des Moines. Perfect. I'm from Des Moines. Okay, flew over Des Moines once. Hi. ( laughing ) Oh, my God, I should be illegal. Shit, I am illegal. How are you doing? I never go in the sun. And I bathe in fresh milk. Assistant State's Attorney Doug Feehan. You're under arrest for solicitation of a prostitute. - Shit. - Come here. Tommy: I didn't... I should have let Al fucking finish you. I'd love to blow your fucking head off, but I can't. I won't say anything. I swear. Here's the deal, sis: leave. Get out of town now. - Don't touch her. - Fuck you, you pimp. Stevie, hey, we're done here. You see that? The kid assaulted me. I said done. Fine by me. Come on, kid. Buy you an egg cream. Buenos dias, Mr. Evans. And to you, Theresa. I still be seeing Senator Sloat. The senator... he like to drink and, you know, the other things. But mostly he like to talk about everything... sometimes about you, sometimes about Señor Diamond. I hear many things. - ( elevator dings ) - Thank you, Theresa. De nada, Mr. Evans. Pull! ( clay pigeon shatters ) - Pull! - ( gunshot ) ( clay pigeon shatters ) Ike: Don't miss. I never miss. I can't believe they let you shoot live rounds. Why? Is it illegal? - Not for Meg Bannock. - ( chuckles ) I wanted to come by in person and thank you for offering to help and stepping in the way you did. I met you first. You remember? - At the Roney. - Molly and I were modeling in this silly Christmas charity. - "Santa's Sweethearts." - Right. And you were the extremely cute, extremely attentive cabana boy. I did love my job. Molly asked if I fancied you. I did. Of course I did. Meg. But I was a child of my... of that world. Those were different times. We were different people. Here's a test for the new Meg Bannock: no pressure, but would you like to come to our Seder tonight... you know, Passover? I know what a Seder is. Really? Only if you're feeling brave. Yes, I'd love to... I mean, a real Seder. Well, I don't know how real it'll be, but it'll be family. Do you need to check with... - Verna? - Vera. I wouldn't want to impose. It'll be fine. Just, I don't know, maybe leave the shotgun at home. Done. You were wearing a white bathing suit at the Roney... bone white. And you were very tan. 7:00 sharp, okay? Sundown? Sundown. I'll see you then. Stevie: I say we start without Grandpa. Ike: Pop will be here. He will. 7:45... two minutes after the last time. So what does the salt water symbolize? Tears. The tears of the Jews, for their suffering. - Of course. - Yes, and ever since, our people have suffered through way too many family Seders. Stevie, Jesus. There are the bitter herbs that symbolize... Yet more suffering. Am I the only one wondering why Lauren is wearing white gloves? A lovely gift from her Aunt Meg. They were Mommy's, from France, right? Molly wore them at the Debutantes' Ball in Paris for her coming out. - Smell. - Lauren. Creed... your mom's perfume. Okay, Lauren, as the youngest, you get to read the four questions. "Why is this night different from all other nights?" - ( music playing ) - ( people chattering, laughing ) Oh. Whew. "Saturday" Zarate's private Cuban stock. ( chuckles ) See the pink? Pure. We call it "Flamingo." Of course you do. You're a bunch of notorious homosexuals. Great party. It's not a party. It's a Seder. But in my house, the angel of death doesn't pass over. He lives in the fucking master bedroom. Darling, come and join us. Have you met my beautiful wife? Not formally. Nicky Grillo... Lily Diamond. Pleasure. - Mrs. Diamond. - Lily, please. Check your ring, sweets. Nicky's a fast one. Can I get you anything? I'm good. But if I think of anything, I'll be sure to ask. Just like Ava Gardner. Where did... where'd you two first meet? Chicago, the Zebra Lounge. She was a hostess. Nicky: Oh, she's a keeper, all right. So, Nicholas, what of our brother Santo, trapped in Castro's wretched jail? - Santo? - Mm. Well, I hear he's good. Oh, the Beard lets him order in his favorite dishes. ( chuckles ) But have you actually seen him? Not in months. So what brings you down to Miami? Not that it's not an absolute delight to have you here in my town. Why? Fuck, man, you got all the broads. Ben! Hey, Ben! Letha here says she has a special party trick she wants to show to us. After dinner, Senator. After dinner. Of course. Of course. Food before rude, huh? ( laughing ) ( laughing ) - Hi, baby. - Grandpa. Hi, Inez. And... and this must be the rabbi. ( laughs ) Arthur: Good to see you, Meg. Hey, meet Inez, the love of my life. - Arturo. Good to meet you. - Hello. - Hello, beautiful family. - Stevie. Arthur: Danny. Okay, here's what's going on. Don't worry. We got the goods. Inez? Coming. Ay, my God. ( whispers ) Ike! - It's... it's shorter. - Arthur: And it's what we're reading. Unless you want Grandpa to leave. - No, you can't. - Unbelievable. We're gonna skip straight to the "Dayenu." All right? I'm so hungry I could eat a rat's tail. So, Lauren, honey, please, you first. "When all children grow up without fear and experience the love they need to reach their full potential." Everybody, "Dayenu." All: Dayenu. Rabbi. Oh. ( chuckles ) "When food and shelter are accepted as human rights, not commodities." - Dayenu. - Dayenu. Isaac. "When all workers of the world receive just compensation in respect for their labors." Dayenu. "When all the cancers in the world can be cut out of all the patients, and they can survive and thrive." - Dayenu. - All: Dayenu. - ( quiet music playing ) - ( people chattering ) Let me help you, Mrs. D. I'll manage. Congratulations. - Nicky... - No. - Nick. - Right. Nick. That's what you called me. I looked for you for days. What a fucking sap. I thought, "Jesus, maybe she's been hurt or something." - I didn't love you anymore. - Anymore? How about ever? I was your bus ticket out of Weeki fucking Wachee, babe. Hey, I get it. Moving up the food chain. Good girl, trading up. You're goddamn right I am. I married Ben Diamond. I am the Butcher's wife. So unless you want your hands nailed to my fucking headboard, get the fuck out of my way! Boo! That's what I thought. I noticed you got a little haircut. - Looks good. - Thanks, Daddy. - That's not for a boy, right? - No. - Did you have fun tonight? - I love our family. Me too. We are something. Vera worked really hard to make sure everybody had a really good night. - I helped. - I know. You certainly did. And we appreciate it. Good night, my princess. - ( switch clicks ) - Daddy. I remembered. - You remembered what? - Mommy's perfume. I remembered it. Me too. Aunt Meg wears it... the same one. I know. Sweet dreams. ( whispers ) Thank you. More. It's going to take much more than that. - Really? - Mm-hmm. ( whispers ) Lauren. ( whispers ) She's had a lot of wine. Out like a light.
