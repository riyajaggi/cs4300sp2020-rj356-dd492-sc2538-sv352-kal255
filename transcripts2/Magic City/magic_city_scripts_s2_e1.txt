 Previously on "Magic City"... We had two goddamn hurricanes this fall that cost me the high holidays. I blew Christmas, thanks to you. Now if I don't make good on Frank's New Year's run, it's over. Limestone, coral, marble... you spent a lot on that palace of yours. I need your help tonight. I'd like you to talk to Mike Strauss. Call off the strike, now. Pull all our guys. It's over. You set me up with Mike. You put me in that hotel room. I'll be fine, Ike. No, you won't be.

 I was the best dancer at the best, most famous club in Havana, maybe the world. What are you offering me? Your ass in a G-string? No. You are my wife. You do not dance anymore. Cliff: Your husband is desperate for Garry Moore to do a weekly CBS show here. "Garry Moore" is a family variety show. We just can't have that... We will host your show for free. I could dance for you too, if you'd like. Meg: You always knew the best of everything. Except, of course, you chose the wrong Bannock girl. You used to call me "the cabana boy." - You used to be one. - I want you to buy out my partner. You built the Miramar for gambling, you... you genius!

 The second it's legal, Ben. Ben: Their next session up in Tallahassee just started. Ike will get them to vote one way or another, and we'll be done. Sy, it's fucking gorgeous down here. Ike: It's his committee. I thought we had a shot. Now I never thought he'd be crazy enough to take your money and then fucking lie about it. - If I had... - No! I gave you my money... you! - Meg: It's the middle of the night. - Ike: I need $100,000. - You're insane. - I'm in trouble. I will give you 10, 15% of my shares. - Who are you? - The wrong woman. You'll burn this, right? Stevie: I got them back... photos, Polaroids, negatives... everything. He's a goddamn bartender! Klein: There's no money, no glory, long hours. We lose more than we win. So why the hell even bother? Because it's right. What do you think? I think we just got inside the Miramar Playa. - No. Please. - What have you got? I saw Ike Evans kill a man. Ben wants you to write something for him. Klein: Isaac Michael Evans, you're under arrest for the murder of James Patrick "Jimmy Shoes" Clayton. ( theme music playing ) ( seagulls cawing ) Mikey? Mikey, you're okay. I'm fine. I was so worried. I'm good. Mikey. Mike. Mike! Mike! ( gate clangs ) You've got a visitor. ( birds chirping ) Al Strauss came to my place this morning. He was crazy. He was screaming you... you belong in here, that you deserve to die in the chair. And not for this thing in the Everglades... for Mike, for what happened to Mike. I asked Ben to talk to Mike. You opened the door to that monster? I begged Mike to back off... begged him. I just needed one week... one fucking week. I had to get the union off my back. I thought that Ben could scare him, you know, maybe... maybe rough him up a little, I don't know, but I didn't think... I... I didn't allow myself to think what could happen, what Ben could do. And I should have, 'cause Mikey... Mikey was my friend. You know that. Everything bad that has happened in my life came from taking Ben's money. Mike's death, Judi nearly getting killed, Klein, fucking this... all because of him. I was wrong. You can't survive this cancer. Walk away. Please get out alive. Fuck it. I'm not going anywhere. You hear me? Ever. Ben Diamond is, not me. - It can't hurt to ask. - Yes, it can. - You said he's your friend. - He is my friend, but he's also an Assistant DA. You understand what that means? Yeah, it means he knows shit about Dad's case. Ethan's not gonna leak anything about an ongoing investigation. I wouldn't. Just feel him out, Danny. Everybody has a price. Danny: Not everybody. Stevie, what if Dad's guilty? The guy was a hit man, a professional killer... Wait, what the fuck are you saying? The judge set bail at a million dollars. They must have some evidence. They got shit... nothing. Dad's innocent, and you fucking know it. Right? Danny. Danny? Yeah. Ben: Hey, Stevie. Stevie, come. - Shit. - The hell does he want? Apparently me. - Come on, Stevie, leave... - Right, and run away? Right, that looks good. Look, it's all right. You just go call your friend at the DA. It's worth a shot. I'll see you after the meeting to fill you in. - Okay. - Go. I'll be fine. - The lad must be famished. - Ben, don't. - Ben, Mrs. Diamond. - No, Lily. Lily. The hanger steak cuts like butter today. Please join us. Look, I have a meeting. Right. Right. Running the ship while the captain's in the brig. You're a good man. And how is the old skipper? Good. He's in good spirits. Well, that is everything, isn't it? A million-dollar bail, I hear. How's that going? Fine. We're... I'm talking to... I'll give you a hundred grand right now, in cash. That's... I appreciate it, but we've already got... Well, should anything fall through, then. Ever wonder where I got my nickname? Nickname? Yeah, my nickname... the Butcher. Ever wonder why they call me that? Never. I was 14 when I ran away from my orphanage. I got a job in a carnie near Harrisburg. I was a shy boy. It didn't do to bring attention to oneself in the home. But somehow around the commotion and the color of the carnival, I... I bloomed. First I got a job as a shill. But in a couple of months, I was the best butcher on the lot. And they called me "the Butcher"... carnie butcher. What, did you hear another story? Oh, come on, don't be a shy boy. Please tell me. I heard... they say that you caught a hooker stealing change from your night table, that you cut off both of her hands and nailed them above your bed. ( laughs ) Well, I guess the moral is you can't fight a good nickname. Now you call me if you need any help with the bail. It doesn't do to have our Ike behind bars. - Absolutely. - Okay. Ben, Mrs. Diamond. No. No, Lily. Stevie Evans, meet Lily Diamond. There. Now it's done. Ethan: "I swear that Ike Evans is innocent. Dandy Al Haas murdered Jimmy Shoes right before my eyes and I will testify to that truth in court." It's her signed, handwritten statement. We found it on the desk in the motel after Haas was killed. That's probably why he came after her. He knew she'd convict him. Dandy Al Haas wasn't protecting himself. He was protecting his boss. Dandy Al Haas worked for Ben Diamond. That's a fact. Haas was shot trying to silence Miss Silver. That's a fact. Therefore, Ben Diamond hoped to silence Miss Silver. Why? To save Ike Evans. My only witness dies... Ike walks. That statement is a meaningless distraction. May I... can I see that... may I see that, please? Does anyone else but the men in this room know about this note? No, sir. Doug, would you lock the door? Yeah. Gentlemen, I'm not a perfect man, far from it. My wife swears I snore. Of course, I'll have to trust her on that. I work far too many hours. I spend far too few hours with my family. I drive my people far too hard. But there is one quality before which I bow to no man: I know the truth. Judi Silver told me the truth. I know it. - But the letter... - I am no fool. I am well aware that Miss Silver is not a perfect witness. She's a whore. It's her word against Ike Evans'. But she is an eyewitness to a murder. And she will testify under oath that she saw Ike Evans kill Jimmy Clayton. The grand jury will indict Ike because I want him indicted, and then he will be brought into a court of law. And, gentlemen, anything... absolutely anything can happen when I face a guilty man in a court of law. Ike will see his fate. And trust me, he will beg to hand over Ben Diamond. Sid: They are his grand jury. Klein picked them. He owns them. Okay. Worst-case scenario. Worst-case... Judi makes a compelling witness, whore or no whore, the grand jury takes Klein's lead and they bring back a murder indictment. Then you know what? You go to court, you do your fucking job and you tear her to shreds. You were with Vincent the night of the murder? All night long. We were working in my suite. He'll testify to it. Physical evidence? You know, Klein could be sitting on something. - His thumb. - Huh. Vincent swears all Klein has is Judi, said he is trying to scare me. He wants me to roll over on Ben. He's so crazy to get Ben Diamond that he's taking stupid chances. This... this is a fucking bluff. You're positive? I like my odds. - ( quiet music playing ) - ( elevator dings ) Oh, Mrs. Evans, a gentleman... Mr. Cliff Wells... he asked me to hand you this as he was checking out. Cliff checked out? Yes, ma'am, with the entire "Garry Moore Show" group, about an hour or so ago. Thank you, Ray-Ray. Me. Florence Greenhouse, Mr. Evans' executive private secretary. Uh-huh. Sorry you feel that way, sir. My dog loves your paper. Mrs. E, wait. Mrs. E! Gentlemen. Stevie: Vera, it turns out that Dad recently sold a percentage of the shares in the hotel to Aunt Meg. - Did he? - Please understand I'm not here in any official capacity. - May I ask how many shares? - 15% of Ike's shares. I see. And my husband retains the rest? Of course. Yes, I'm really, I guess, a symbolic shareholder. If I may, a bit more than symbolic. Vera, I'm here only as a concerned family friend and relative, no business agenda. Ike came to me in need. And I... well, of course, I did what I could. - I would again. - Of course you would. So, Sid, maybe fill us in on Dad's bail situation. It's pretty simple: judge set bail at one million dollars, I've got my bondsman standing by, and the second that we show up with $100,000, Ike is home. Well, we obviously have no choice. Let's get them the money. Vera, the hotel's monthly grosses are healthy, but it's a fluid, seasonal business. Our cash flow is... the summer months, which are historically our slowest, are coming up. We have to tighten our belts. Wait. Look, gentlemen, as I said, I do understand this is a great sum of money, but this... this palace is ours. Mrs. Evans is right. This hotel is worth a hundred times that number. Put the Miramar Playa up as collateral, and any bank... - Ike won't allow it. - But why not? Of course, he would have to reveal his minority partners. Minority partners? This is like "Alice in Wonderland." We... Ike owns the Miramar, yes? Yes, just not outright. Ike owns the controlling percentage of Miramar Playa, Incorporated... 51%. Actually, Mr. Evans and my client together own 51%. Who is this minority partner? An excellent question, Mrs. Evans. In a deed of record, 49% of Miramar Playa, Inc., is owned by Minneapolis Mutual Investment Corp. - Who the hell is that? - You'll have to ask your father. Okay, okay, okay. How else can we get my husband out of jail today? I would loan him the money. Please, you've done too much already. I'm sure that with all of these fine minds here, we can come up with a solution that won't impose on your generosity any further. Stevie: This is a crisis, Phil. Every second my dad sits in jail, it's a PR disaster waiting to happen. Stevie's right. "The Herald" is already camped out in my office. I mean, this story breaks, with Ike in jail... Jesus. Stevie: Okay, we sell the empty adjoining lots and get Ike out of jail. We sell nothing. We do not touch one foot of the Miramar Playa. Ike dreamt this place. He built it. He willed it, all of it. It is his life and mine. - Vera... - Besides, how long will a sale take? Days? Weeks? You're right. This... this is a crisis. Is the unused acreage fully owned by Ike? Those lots might be separate. Ike bought them later, could have kept a separate deed. I'll check. Vera: If so, we could borrow against that property. The bank might loan us the money immediately. - Miss Bannock would need to sign off. - Of course. Have you been to George Lubow at the bank? I have my jewelry, our artwork, cars, Ike's personal stock portfolio. Perhaps George would be willing to make us a personal loan. I'll call him. Vera: Gentlemen, my husband's hotel will not be carved up while I'm still breathing. Do you understand me? Excuse me. Stevie. I think we know what we have to do. Gents? I'll be out in a second. May I have a word? Vera, I'm not the enemy. Then what exactly are you? Ben Diamond offered Stevie the 100 grand bail money. Fuck, no. No. You tell Stevie we don't take anything from that man. - You hear me? - Okay. Sid will get me out. Why didn't I toss that fucking jacket into the quarry? Because you're not a pro. You're not thinking right, so you handle what you can. You're lost, so you take off. You ball up the jacket. You throw it under the seat. When I was a detective, that's how I used to solve half the homicides. Somebody would always do something stupid. Hey, the jacket's gone. Klein isn't putting up any crime scene evidence, just Judi. Whoever took that jacket, some valet or what have you, tossed it by now. Because if he didn't, we'd fucking know about it. ( siren wailing ) ( music playing on radio ) ♪ I ran all the way home ♪ ♪ Just to say I'm sorry ♪ ♪ What can I say? ♪ ♪ I ran all the way ♪ ♪ Yay, yay, yay... ♪ ( song continues ) ( quiet music playing ) Stevie. A gimlet, right? I want to apologize if I... I... I wasn't thinking before. I want Ike back, you know, so bad. If I was rude to you... I don't care about manners. - I just want my father home. - And so do I. - Then take Meg's money. - No. No. ( sighs ) No more from Meg. Look, we'll find the money. - We will get Ike out ourselves. - Really? - Yes. - How? Jesus, Vera, take her money, now. You let your pride or your jealousy or whatever's keeping you from doing what's right for Ike, and this whole thing could come down around our heads, and fucking fast. You think you're handling this? You think you can do this? I'm just trying to... Well, try harder. Bel's coming over. Put on something more appropriate. Appropriate for Bel? What's wrong with this dress? There's too much of it. - How much? - Make it an even quarter of a million. What, you're building the fucking Taj Mahal or something? - Close. - ( Ben chuckles ) A ziggurat, like in Persia. - Oh. - It'll be the seventh wonder, babe, only the top girls, young, clean, skin like fresh cream. I'm gonna build a room with a see-through mirror so that husbands can watch their wives balling other women. It's gonna be in unincorporated Opa-locka, so no Miami cops. - I've got everyone bought. - Good. Benny, this is going to be the finest poon palace in the States. - ( footsteps approach ) - Bel, give us a second. The hell I will. - Belvin. - Lady Renee. Okay. I'll give you 200... half now, half on opening night. - I want 70% of the girls. - Whew. And you get to keep the booze, dope, whatever else you can squeeze. And my people are in the money room doing the books. Oh, did you want me to leave Helga, Queen of the Death Camps? Perhaps some other time. Bel and I gotta work. Oh, and I want a schvartze, a big one. You know, the rednecks down here love a little dark meat. Letha from the piney woods of Georgia, black as coal, and she can crack a walnut with her labia. - ( laughs ) - Later, boys. For her new joint in Opa-locka? Renee always makes money. And with Havana still gone, Chicago's growling. Gotta feed the beast. Well... a big day. Not big enough. This is all bolita? Yeah. At least one gift from Fidel. The spics he chased out... they play bolita like rabbits. - A taste of home, perhaps. - Yeah. Makes 'em feel like they're still back in Cuba. But how do you explain the schwugs? Overtown is breaking records. To the Negro, we are hope, Belvin. ( phone rings ) Their one shot in a million at the American dream. Diamond residence. Yeah. Come on, that can't be legal. Okay, so now what? Yeah. He will. - Klein burned the confession. - Fuck. You believe that shit? The whore testifies tomorrow. Leave it. Leave it. Bel! Okay, get Ike his bail and kill the girl. Every second he sits in that cage is another chance he'll talk. Besides, the Miramar won't last another week without him. Klein's got half the Miami PD guarding her room. I can't get near it. And Stevie won't take our dough. I'm hearing a lot of "can't" and "won't" from you, Belvin. I can just make his bail for him. I'll pay the bondsman... Ike walks. Because it can't be traced back to me. I'm Ike's silent partner for a reason. I'm on it. Close the door. ( woman sobbing ) It wasn't my fault. - Hey, you bums. - Look out. The agitator. Look who made the front page of the "Forward." "Miami civil rights activist Dr. John Brown." No, no. There, at the end of the lunch counter. - That's you. - Hell, yeah. We sat in at the McCrory on Flagler... C.O.R.E. Dr. Brown almost got arrested. - Meshugenah. - Uh-huh. There, Bobby Kennedy. Arthur: Kennedy, the old man... Joe Kennedy... that anti-Semitic prick, he should rot in hell. ( Danny chuckles ) Mwah. How are you doing, bubbeleh? I'm good. I'm good. You know, summer vacation coming up. Hey, come with me. There's gonna be civil rights actions all over Miami this summer. Well, I was thinking... I've been asked to work as an intern in the state attorney's office. Klein? Maybe that's not such a hot idea, not right now. Grandpa, you're... you know, you're a man of principle, right? - I mean, this stuff... - I know my right from wrong. What if you knew something was wrong... illegal... but to acknowledge it would go against what was good for the family? Why are you asking? Nothing, you know. I... something came up at law school. Uh-huh. Look, who knows, you know? But let's say your pop does something bad. We all do. We all make mistakes. But he's my boy, my blood. I love him. He might do something bad, but he cannot be bad, not to me. Why am I going to hate the people of the United States? I don't hate anybody, including my enemies... ( chuckles ) What a load of shit. That fucking commie hates us. Two years I worked in the Riv... two fucking beautiful years, man. Money... raining money. And then that bearded fuck comes in. Now they got goats and pigs shitting in a casino. Could I get one of those? Thank you. They closed them all? Castro closed down the casinos, the hotels? Well, they're open, but you could fire a gun through the Riv and not hit a paying guest. Ghost towns, Captain. Mm. Mm, the Riv, the Capri, Nacional... they used to print money. Now... graveyards. That dumb fuck... he's losing a fortune... a fortune. ( man on TV )...between communism and democracy. Whose side...? Where is your heart? They are not agreed with communism. My acts prove... Millions up in smoke. Castro:...full power in Cuba. Revolution destroy all the enemies... Castro is in New York right now begging for money. He's broke. The fucking idiot doesn't realize he's sitting on five of the biggest moneymaking hotel-casinos on earth. He doesn't like the mob. Good. Great. Fine. You know what? They're gone. I'm not the mob. - You? - I'm clean. Let him look. Others have. What's he gonna find? Ben Diamond and his cronies in my cabana playing gin rummy? Big fucking deal. Here is my offer to Fidel: Ike Evans from the world-famous Miramar will come in and run his hotels. I will bring in a clean casino, man. I will pay Fidel and his starving country 60... okay, you know what? 70% of gross profits. That's, what, $2, $3 million a week, cash. That is over $100 million a year. So why the fuck do you need Sy Berman? To get Ben Diamond out of my hotel. Oh, God. I'm offering a trade, straight up, the Miramar for Cuba. I will front for the outfit. Cubans will never know the mob's getting paid. Sy will net a million dollars a week, to start. I am offering Sy Havana. He can have it back. All he has to do is get Ben out of the Miramar. I want Ben Diamond fucking gone. ( keys jingling ) Gather your belongings, Mr. Evans. You made bail. It's all right. It's gonna be all right. Of course. Of course it is. Let's go home. ( sighs ) So Lubow finally came through. Nope. Bel Jaffe. Bel? Bel gave you $100,000? Mm-hmm. - I didn't want their money, V. - It's just a loan. He'll get it back the day you appear for trial. He told me that you being in jail even for one day was hurting his business, which apparently is really good. It's not what I wanted. We needed you. We needed you out. I mean, what was I supposed to do, leave you in there? That business, gambling... that's Ben's, Bel's, not mine, not the Miramar's. Vera, I don't want you involved in this. If you are, I am. ( sighs ) I owe you an apology. I let Ben get to you. It's my mistake, and I am sorry. I know he forced you to write that ridiculous new testimony, had Al try to kill you. But that will not happen again. You're safe now. You're safe with me. Tomorrow you will tell the grand jury under oath what we both know to be the truth. You will tell it because it is the truth and because you know how I feel about lying, how very, very unhappy it makes me. Do you understand me, Miss Silver? Yes. Good. Good. Get some rest. I will see you in court. Try not to dress like a cheap whore, okay? Ike, you have a gift. You mind if I call you Ike? I've watched you. I've seen you throughout the years spin shit into gold, but for others... all the nothing properties that you made soar. And now this... finally, your finest vision, the great Miramar Playa, dying before your very eyes. And for what? For a few million dollars? It's a shonda, I tell you. It's a sin. Frankly, I couldn't give a shit about Miami Beach... no legal gambling and too many cranky Jews. My casinos in Havana make more money than grains of sand on this fucking beach. This would be a diversion. I'll give you the cash and let you do what you know how to do best, and you make us both a profit. Cutty Sark on the rocks, sir? - Thank you, Ray-Ray. - My pleasure, sir. Welcome home. ( sirens wailing ) Listen, I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for working together in my absence. I know it's been hard, and I'm sorry. And here's all I'm gonna say about this, and then we're gonna move on because there's more important things to get to. I am innocent. I did not do this thing for which I'm being charged. Now that being said, I've got complete faith in our legal system and know that in a matter of a few hours this is all gonna be some strange and incredibly stupid memory. Okay? Stevie: I called the Folies in Paris, every girlie show in Vegas. I tried to steal the "Moulin Rouge" from Novack at the Fontainebleau, and his lawyers jumped all over me. Dad, we're gonna have to refund. With what? We spent that money months ago. All right, what about a big act... Tony Bennett, Steve and Eydie? We took advances in cash for a Latin burlesque act... you know, girls, dance. Besides, we can't afford headliners in the summer. What about V's show? - What show? - Nothing. In the "Garry Moore" meeting, the only thing that got their attention was when Vera offered to dance, to use some famous Cuban choreographer and, you know, do something from the Tropicana. Sounded great. Right, V? Look, I knew Cliff. He'd seen me dance, worked with me before. I thought he would be interested. - He was crazy for it. - Hey, you know, the boss's wife. All right, Vera Evans, the queen of the Miramar Playa, formerly the queen of the Tropicana, dances again. That could be a story. That's a damn good story. "The Herald" would eat it up. We do a spread on the two of you, and we get pictures of V at the Trop. Yeah, but it's in six weeks... six. You could do that? No. V, could you? Yes, we could. Cesar has plenty of our dancers from Cuba here. And we'd use a show that we'd danced before. But, yes, we could do it. All right. That's good enough for me. ( man clears throat ) Is this the man, Miss Silver? Please, yes or no? Yes. Let the record show that Miss Silver has identified the victim... James Clayton. Continue. He took me out to the Everglades and he was going to kill me, I guess. I... I was pretty out of it. He'd hit me, you know? Anyhow, Jimmy was about to shoot me and... And Dandy Al Haas took out a lead sap and beat him to death. ( crowd murmuring ) Miss Silver, you have previously testified to the state's attorney that you saw Isaac Michael Evans kill James Clayton that night. I lied. You lied? Are you aware that you face perjury charges right now, prison time, that you... that you have taken a sworn oath to this secret grand jury? I'm telling the truth now. No. You're perjuring yourself right now. Miss Silver, this is a very, very serious confession. Can you please tell the court why you lied originally? Because this man... this man of the law, Jack Klein, put a fucking gun to my face and told me to blame Ike Evans, or he would kill me. He told me to lie, or he would shoot me in the face. ( crowd murmuring ) Man: We'd better go see the judge. ( toilet flushes ) I'd love to help you out as always, Jack. Hell, it's your grand jury. But, Jesus, man, you really got your tit stuck in a wringer this time. She's lying. Well, of course she is. But a lying whore telling a grand jury that our Dade County State's Attorney threatened her life... I don't know. Of course, it's my judicial experience that that kind of person... well, they don't make for the best witnesses, if you know what I mean. You got anything else, anybody else? I can get her to testify, to tell the truth. How are you gonna do that? Shoot her in the foot? ( chuckles ) You opened this can of worms, Jackson, and you're gonna be looking at some very, very bad press, not to mention a legal ethics review. You gotta drop this thing. I thank you for your time, Your Honor. Hey. I want to ask you a question. Come here. Did you really pull a gun on that girl? ( laughs ) ( upbeat Latin music playing ) There it is. Thank you. Pop, how about a toast? He who speaketh the truth stabbeth falsehood through the heart. Hey. It's all good, okay? I promise. - You're my only boy. - That we know of. - Arthur: Oh, you. - ( Inez chuckles ) Danny, my boy. How's my favorite attorney? - Congratulations, Pop. - Thank you. Ike: Your legal system worked. Justice was served. Danny: Absolutely. No, it's great, really. - Where have you been? - With Mercy. They're doing a rosary for Maria at St. Patrick's. To Maria. ( phone ringing ) - I love you. - Me too. Man: Mr. E. For you. It's Miss Bannock. Meg, where are you? You should be here. I might as well be there. I can hear you. Well, it is a celebration. Meg: Well, looks like I'm going to have to eat this cake with the file in it myself. Um, Meg, listen, Stevie told me what you did. I... I want to thank you. You should be here with us, have a drink, just... just for a second. Another time, really. Thank you, Meg. Bye. - Stevie. - Ben. - Ike. - Mrs. Diamond. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - May I get you something to drink? - A champagne cocktail. Big night. You'll have your money back by morning. Ben: Well, I thought I'd drop by to tell you how happy I am about the good news. Well, you've told me. Yes. Yes. I have. I do not want or need your help. You understand me? Oh. Oh, I see. May we have a word alone? Excuse us. Your weekend in prison has ruined your manners, Isaac. A simple thank-you would suffice. I need to get back to my family. Here's what I think... I think you need to get your hands off me. I think you've been through an ordeal. I think you've forgotten who you can and who you cannot disrespect. And that is a fool's amnesia. Isaac, it's never too late to be taught the swift and final realities of this life of ours. I'll drink to that. Another time, perhaps. Mrs. Evans. ♪ When the night comes... ♪ - Yeah.
