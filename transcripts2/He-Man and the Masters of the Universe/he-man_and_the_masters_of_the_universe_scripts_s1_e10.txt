 He-Man. And the Masters of the Universe. I am Adam, Prince of Eternia. Defender of the secrets of Castle Grayskull. This is Cringer, my fearless friend. Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held aloft my magic sword and said, by the power of Grayskull. I have the power!

 Cringer became the mighty Battle Cat, and I became He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe. Only three others share this secret: Our friends the Sorceress, Man-at-Arms, and Orko. Together we defend Castle Grayskull from, the evil forces of Skeletor. Here they come. Are we there yet, father? What? Yes, dear... you can open your eyes. We... We've landed.

 Ileena! I was wanting to your visit. Me too, Teela. I'm glad my dad had to deliver the transmutator. Teela, Ileena, guess what? Jarvan the sorcerer has escaped the prison mines... he could be on his way here right now! Why here? King Randor and He-Man imprisoned him a long time ago... he swore revenge. Oh, do you think we're safe? Not to worry, he's probably in another galaxy by now. Come, Ileena. Back on Eternia, at last. Now to find Randor and He-Man and take my revenge. Someone's coming. I don't want to be seen, just yet... this will frighten them away. I think, this is the way. Oh no! Geyser Field. Hurry, before the gas overcomes us. Ileena, come on. Teela, help. I'm frightened. Teela, what happened? Adam, Teela and Ileena aren't back yet. They're probably enjoying themselves. If it'll make you feel better... I'll call Teela on the comm-link. Teela... Teela, can you hear me? Adam, help... we're trapped in the Geyser Field. Teela may be hurt. Hold on, Ileena, try to stay calm. I'll send for help. By the power of Grayskull. I have the power! Don't move. This won't hurt a bit. He-Man! He-Man. It'll be alright now. Oh, thank you. I was so frightened. If only I were more like Teela... this wouldn't have happened. Let's get Teela home. Let's go, Battle Cat. Quickly but gently. He will lead me to the King, Then I will make them both pay for sending me away. It just isn't fair. My father can make anything. Why can't he make me big and strong? Why? [cries] So, this little one needs help... I will help her... to help me. But first, a disguise. What's wrong, deary? Who are you? Just an old woman, dear... What's wrong, child? Because I'm so weak and timid... my friend got hurt. Oh, I wish I could be stronger. Oh, is that all that's bothering you? I can fix that, deary. You can? But... but, I don't know what it is. It will make you feel anything you want to feel... Strong, tall, anything. Feel better? How can I thank you? Oh, I'll think of something. Ileena! Take this, ...with it you can call me. Just say: Em ot emoc. Ileena, where are you? I'm here, Teela. How are you? Oh, I'm all recovered. But what are you doing up there? Here, let me help you down. You'll fall. No, I won't, and what's more... I'm not afraid. I never knew you could do that. [laughs] I didn't either. Let's go back. I'll race ya. This is the transmutator. It can change things from solid to liquid or gas. Watch the tree. The tree has been changed from wood to gold. It can change it back. I must have that machine, and I know a good idea, how to get it. Are you alright Ileena? What? Yes, fine. Why don't you get some fresh air? Adam and I will... join you in a while. I, I will. She was fine just a short while ago... but now she looks almost ill. I feel so sick, so tired and weak. Maybe that kind old woman can help. What were those words again? Em ot emoc. Yes, deary, you called? Oh, where did you come from? What does that matter? I'm here. What's wrong? Oh, I feel awful, I thought... maybe some more potion? Of course, deary. Adam, I think we better find Ileena, I'm worried about her. Just what I was thinking. Let's go. Ileena! Hi Adam, Teela! How are you feeling? Oh I'm fine, I'm just terrific. In fact I feel so good I think I'll do something I've always wanted to do... I think I'll take my father's Air Car for a ride. Wanna come? Have you flown it before? Are you sure you know how? Of course, I can do anything Adam... Want to come? Sure, Ileena! Ileena, slow down. Oh Adam, don't be such a fun-stopper. Ileena, try to land. I can't... I don't know what to do. How did I ever get myself into a fix like this? But more importantly, how do I get out? Oh! Hang on, Adam. By the power of Grayskull. I have the power! I feel sick. You should, that was a wild ride. Tell me, have you ever flown this before? No, I, never have. That was very dangerous, Ileena, and not very smart. Adam! Adam is safe. Come on! You can use some rest. I feel so terrible. There's only one thing that will make me feel better. Em ot emoc. Yes deary. Please, I feel awful. Can I have some more potion? Not this time, sweetie. It's time you paid me back. How? I want the transmutator. I can't pass the voice print, but you can. Get the transmutator for me. I won't do that. If you want some of that nice potion, you will. She's gone. Oh, how did I ever get myself into this? I wish I'd never drank that potion. Ileena, please tell me what's wrong. I can't, Adam. I can't help if you won't let me. I have to have more potion. But I can't steal father's transmutator... But, if I bring her the transmutator, once I drink the potion, I'll be strong... enough to take it back. How did I get myself into this trouble. Please, open the door, I'm Ileena. Voice print matches, you may enter. There's no one here. Oh, thank goodness. It's too heavy. I saw you come in, need some help? Yes. I... I need to take this to.. the terrace... Then I'd like to be alone, Orko. Your wish is my command. Now you can push it on to the terrace, the spell will wear off... when you set it down. Bye. Em ot emoc. Well done, deary. Please, the potion. No, I don't think so. Please, I need your help. But I no longer need yours... I think Jarvan was too smart for you. Jarvan? He tricked me. I've go to... warn... the others. It's gone, it's gone, it's vanished. What's gone, Zicran? The transmutator. Someone stole the transmutator. Man-At-Arms, Teela. Come quick! Somethings happened to Ileena! She's coming to now. Oh father, I did something awful. There, there now... what is it? I gave the transmutator to Jarvan, the sorcerer. By the power of Grayskull. I have the power! Now that I've gotten He-Man's attention... I'll have my revenge. You'll have to aim better than that, Jarvan. Alright, try this! Your marksmanship leaves me cold, Jarvan. A little heat should slow you down. Run through that, He-Man. Why go through it... when I can go over it! Good move, He-Man. But not good enough. The flash! I can't see. You may able to see in a moment, He-Man. And you'll see, that you've lost. Yes, this transmutator is a wonderful thing. It can turn the air around you to rock... or shrink the palace down to a more managable size. I can't deactivate the transmutator. The... the palace is shrinking. I got to break free. Oh, I think it's time, to turn on my force field. I can't take the time to break through the force field... I've got to save the palace. Maybe if I can hold the center of the Palace, I can stop.... the whole thing from shrinking I've come through tight spots before. I could use a bit more elbow room. It's getting awfully crowded here. He-Man is holding this back. But even He-Man... won't be able to fight the machine's full power. Is everyone alright? What happened? He-Man's resistance made the Transmutator overload.... and it blew up. Might over matter, right? It is not over yet. Look! Jarvan's stunned, but he'll be back. If only there were a way to bring him here... while he's still weak. Jarvan gave me this ring to summon him with. Why did he do that, Ileena? I felt weak and timid. Jarvan gave me a potion... and then said that it would make me strong... and brave. And did it? It made me feel good at first, but it wore off... and I needed more and more. He made you dependent on some kind of drug. You're lucky you did'nt continue. I know that now. If we can rig up an amplifier, maybe... we could use this ring to summon him, and amplify its summoning power to keep him here. It's ready now, Ileena. Now, Ileena. Em ot emoc. He-Man, you brought me here... but you can't make me stay. I can if that's all you've got Jarvan. Playing with fire eh, Jarvan? Give up, Jarvan. You can't win. Maybe not, but I never lose. Have a nice trip, Jarvan? You haven't heard the last of me, He-Man! Aw, you mean you'll write to me from the prison mine. Thanks for helping me to catch Jarvan, Ileena. That was very brave. What I did earlier was very stupid. I still don't understand why you took the potion, Ileena. I wanted to be like you, Teela. I think you two will agree... that the only way to feel good... is to first, feel good about yourself. In today's story, Ileena tried taking a magic potion... which she thought would help her. Well, she found out there aren't any magic potions. And you know what? There aren't any magic drugs either. Any time you take one from anybody... but your parents or your doctor, you're taking a very big... chance. You're gambling with your health, maybe even your life. Drugs don't make your problems go away... they just create more.
