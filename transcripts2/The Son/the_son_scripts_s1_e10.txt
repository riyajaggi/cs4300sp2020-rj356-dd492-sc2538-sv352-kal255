 This whole town... Look here. Damn time. Louis: We're under attack, Sheriff. They're coming after us. Who are? What are you talkin' about? Tell the sheriff what you saw. I was comin' around the corner there, and I saw a bunch of Pedro García's men running away from the fire. I shouted at 'em to stop, but they took off. How many men did you see running away, Louis?

 Four, maybe five of 'em. I shoulda followed 'em, Sheriff. I know I should've, but.. the fire went up so fast and I had to tend to that first, so I ran for the water truck and -- You did the right thing. We're gonna fight back. You hear me? Look, you don't have to convince me. I'm just trying to get all the facts before I go banging on Pedro García's door in the middle of the night. Those are the facts! He just told you! All right, Niles. All right. You better stay with the car. I'll be fine. Colonel, thank God you're here. Pedro García burned down my saloon.

 We need your help. I wouldn't be anywhere else. Everybody, gather 'round. Most of you have known me a long time. Yes, sir. Mm-hmm. You know I'm a patient man. I'm a deliberate man. I'm a fair man. But tonight, once again, we were attacked. Tonight, this war continues against us, against our women and children, against our way of life! And make no mistake -- it is a war. And what have we done to stop it? Look around at yourselves. You're all brave men, but what have you done to stop this? Not a goddamn thing. That's right. He's right. Mm-hmm. Truth is... I am guilty of hesitation. Because I believed that this problem was gonna go away on its own, but it has not. Our enemies are not common bandits or common thieves. They're not after gold and land. They're determined to destroy our way of life, and their weapon of choice is terror. So they burn down homes. They derail trains. They shoot innocent people in broad daylight. And now I'm hearing that they have been aided and abetted and supported by one of our own! You all know the Garcías were there when our ranch was hit. People are saying that maybe they had something to do with it. Is it true? I don't know, but I sure as hell want to find out! And what are we gonna do? Do you think we should continue to do nothing?! No. Do you want to look your wives in the face and tell 'em you did nothing?! All: No! You want to look your children in the face and tell them you did nothing?! No! No more innocent men being murdered. No more buildings being burned in the night. Man: No more. Do you want justice or not? Yes! Are you with me?! Yes! Are you ready to go and deliver that justice now?! Yes! Let's get 'em. Let's get 'em. ** ** Hello! Hey! ** Maria! Let me in! Maria! Peter. What's wrong? What are you doing here? I need to talk to your father. No. N-No, that's not a good idea. ** What is this? Pedro, you need to let me in. I don't think so. We need to talk. You're all in danger. ** What is it? My father found oil on your land. Did you hear what I said? I heard. I'm just trying to figure out why your father sent you to say this. My father didn't send me. He did everything he could to stop me from coming. Why would you do this for me? I think you know why. Maria. Maria. Why is your father doing this, Pete? What does he want? There's oil on your land. ** Get out of my house! Mama. We should all go. My father doesn't start fights he can't win. Pete. You have to help me convince your father. Convince him of what exactly? Convince him to leave. I don't know what to believe, Pete. Is your father doing this? Or are you? Or is it both of you? At this point, it's everyone in town. You have to go. No. Why? No one wants you here. Do you understand that? They've all been waiting for an excuse. My father gave it to them. So we just run over the border in the middle of the night? Yes. This is the United States. There are laws here. Not right now there aren't. We're not running, Pete. You're gonna protect us. You are going to stop him. ** I can't believe you're back. Barely made it. Everyone thought you went back to the whites. Everyone? None of that matters. You're here now. We have to move quickly. Come on. Help. Let's go. Go where? You came back to get me. Didn't you? ** I don't understand. Why are you here? You could've run. ** I belong here. ** ** ** ** Tiehteti? ** What happened? Where were you? Where's Prairie Flower? ** ** Stay back. What'd you do? What did I do? You disappeared. So you just went and got married, just like that? I had no choice. This is our way. You know this. ** You have to go away, Eli. I can't see you anymore. Toshaway: Tiehteti. Where is he? Tiehteti. Come on. Come with me. Four horses? He pushes me off a cliff, and you get four horses? Four horses is a lot. I could have died. But you didn't. And now I have four more horses. You can have two of them. It's not right. The punishment should be bigger. I don't think he was very happy about it, either. He'll have to borrow the horses from Prairie Flower's father. It's not about the horses. There are other girls. We'll find you a different one. It doesn't work like that. I love her. And she's with someone else now. Then I'll kill him. ** Comanche cannot hurt another Comanche. You're free, Tiehteti. If you want to go back to the whites, no one can stop you. But if you want to be one of us, then you'll live by our rules. Understand? ** Clean this up. Tomorrow, we go hunting. ** This is beautiful. Mm. Try not to shoot yourself. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** Did you cut the phone lines? Yes, sir. Get that dynamite ready! Once we lay down enough fire to pin 'em down, we'll blow the door. You ready? Ready. Man: You got the shotgun? ** ** ** ** ** ** Just surrender yourself, Pedro! ** I will not. How many of you did I personally welcome when you came to this town? How many have dined here at my house with my family? And now here you are. To kill me. To take my land. You turned my bar into a goddamn bonfire! No. I would never destroy property in this town. It is my home. My family has lived here for two centuries. How long have you lived here, Niles Gilbert? ** How 'bout you, Sheriff? Minister Frank, how long have you lived in this town? ** To me, you are all intruders. Carpetbaggers. Canallas. ** And you, Eli, you, now I see my mistake. You will never have enough. Enough land, enough money. I should have let you die with all your family. ** Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. Pete. Get away from there. I don't know what my father told you, but you're all being lied to. Pedro didn't burn down that bar. Come on, Pete. He's using all of you to get this land. Please stop. My family is bankrupt. We're about to lose the ranch. I don't wanna say this. Not in front of all these people who care about you. He paid somebody to burn down that bar. Easy, son. Pete, I know you've been going through a hard time. There are people here who can help you. We can find medicines for your troubled mind. Just...come back to your friends. There's oil on Pedro's land. My father wants it. He's willing to do whatever it takes. ** That's a lie, Pete. Pedro's been supporting the sediciosos for years. But that wasn't enough, I guess. Today... I lost my place of business! But be rest assured, tomorrow, it will be one of you. Your homes, your families. Unless we take action now. Hold it together. ** ** You see how the wind's blowing. ** Come with me, son. ** Aah! Eli: Pete! Pete! Pete! Stop shooting! Stop shooting now! Down, down. Aah! Mi amor. Aah! ** Aah! Ugh! ¿Dónde está Maria? ** ** ** Ignacio! ** No! ** ** ** ** Niles: Get in there! Get that door open now! Give 'em cover. ** Ugh! ** Ugh! ** Get those guns up! Get those goddamn guns up! ** That's good. Press 'em down. Roof's clear. Good man, Neptune. Now retrieve that damn dynamite. ** Light it up. ** ** Get back, boys. Get back. ** Come on. Come on. ** Come on. Aah. Is Pete alive? Is Pete alive? I don't know. Let's get you out of here. It's all right. ** You're mad at me? Yeah. I don't like it. I don't really care. She your first woman? Eh, you're young. There'll be others. Man: Hyah! Hyah! Those are goddamn rangers. Yeah. Ugh! Ugh. Ugh! Aah! Ugh! Get the horses. Find the others. ** ** Don't do that! Aah! Ooh. Aah! Aah! I bet that smarts, huh? Aah! ** You gonna be my first Injun. ** You know, I hear tell... you can't get into heaven if someone takes your scalp. ** Come here. That long black hair a'yours is gonna look real sweet hangin' from my belt. Hold still, ya -- Ugh. ** ** ** Why'd you come here? Why are you after us? Y-You're on our land. If you go somewhere else, we'd leave you alone. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** Maria? ** Shh. Come on. Come on. Shh. Shh. Shh. We got to leave right now, okay? Mm-hmm. ** Maria, we got to move quick. We got to move quick. Come on. ** Louis. Hey, Louis. How you holding up there, buddy? You didn't say it was gonna be like this. What'd you think it was gonna be like? We're all going to hell. Well... maybe you just don't have the stomach for this. ** ** Come on. ** ** Phineas: So, it seems Pedro had been sympathetic to the sediciosos longer than any of us had realized. He burned down Niles' bar, which could have destroyed the whole town. We're lucky it didn't. And after that, everyone in town was so furious and scared, they all rode out to the García ranch. And the Colonel tried to talk Pedro into surrendering peacefully, but... his men just opened fire. That doesn't make any sense. Why would they start shooting with the family inside? I don't know what to tell you. Maybe he felt cornered. By the mob of people with torches surrounding their house? Hard to believe. There weren't any torches. How do you know? You weren't even there. Phineas: A whole lot of people died. Everyone in town's wearing black. It's horrible. So wh-where was Daddy in all this? He was trying to reason with Pedro. Stop anyone from getting hurt. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. So where is he now? Is he dead? No, if he was, we would have found him by now. Well, then where is he? Where'd he go? ** He left us. So it doesn't matter. Of course it matters. What's wrong with you? Shut your mouth. ** We have every Pinkerton in the state looking for him. I promise you all, I'll do everything in my power to find him. ** Tell me the truth. What did you do to him? Where is he really? We don't know. How could you possibly not know? I'm sorry, Sally. Don't apologize. Tell me something that isn't bullshit! I know you're understandably upset. What have you done to our family, Eli? I need to rest. Pete hasn't been well for a long time. It's everything you been feeling, everything you been noticing about him. And this was the, uh... the last straw, I guess. Something broke. All right, you're telling me how Pete is, but not where he is. ** ** The last time I saw Pete, he was heading to the border with Maria García. ** ** Did you know about them? No. ** He is not right in the head, Sally. Anyone who would leave you -- ** Don't. ** ** ** ** ** ** * It seemed the better way * When first I heard him speak * Now it's much too late * To turn the other cheek * It sounded like the truth * Seemed the better way * Sounded like the truth * But it's not the truth today * I wonder what it was * I wonder what it meant * First, he touched on love * And then it touched on death * It sounded like the truth * Seemed the better way * Sounded like the truth * It's not the truth today * I better hold my tongue * I better take my place * Lift this glass of blood * Try to say the grace ** ** ** Judge Kilborne: In the matter of the agricultural land formerly owned by Pedro García, including the house, outbuildings, and 125,000 undeveloped acres. The original deed is Spanish. Paid the last transfer... April 17, 1750. $563.64 are due Dimmit County in back taxes. I will begin the bidding at $563.64. Are there any bidders here? ** Are there any other bidders here? ** Going once. Going twice. Sold to the McCulloughs. ** * Seemed the better way * When first I heard him speak * Now it's much too late * To turn the other cheek * Sounded like the truth * Seemed the better way * Sounded like the truth * But it's not the truth today * I better hold my tongue * I better take my place * Lift this glass of blood * Try to say the grace ** ** When will they stop coming? They won't. ** **
