 You have anyone watching the town? I got a couple deputies monitoring the trains. Horseback over the border's the more likely way to go. Well, she's not going to Mexico. What makes you so sure? She wants blood. Running away isn't gonna get her what she wants. Oh, morning. Where you been all night? We were worried. Well, I got drunk. Did you now? What we did, that don't shake off like it used to.

 Well, while you were out drinkin', your daughter ran away. Jeannie? Come on. Open up. Hey Daddy. Are you all right? I'm fine. Start talkin'. I don't know. I just... I didn't wanna be here. I understand, Bug. I wanted you to grow up in a better place. That you'd never have to see the things I saw at your age. What kinda things?

 Your Uncle Phineas and I grew up doing terrible harm to people. Bad people? Sometimes. The only thing that let us sleep nights was the Colonel whispering in our ear, telling us it was normal. Well, it's not. This place, it's poison. You know... I think that's the real reason you ran to Mexico. You just couldn't take being here. Tell me the truth. Our family killed the Garc?as and we stole their land. If I hadn't taken Maria across the border, she'd be dead too. I can't lie about it anymore. Now... there's no way to bring all those people back. So I'm doing one last thing, to try and make it right. What? I'm gonna help Miss Garc?a win her court case. And after that? Nt t that. Now, I don't know where I'm gonna go next, or what I'm gonna do. A future with me, that's a hard, uncertain road. Do you understand that? Yes. All right. Pack a bag, and keep it hidden. She can't hide forever. We'll get her, Colonel. My men understand the urgency... How is she? She'll be all right. Why's he here? I'm helping your daddy with something. She's in Dallas. She wanted me to meet her up there, talk to her lawyers. Lobby of the Adolphus. 6PM, Wednesday. Found it in my saddlebag. Huh. How'd it get into your saddlebag? I don't know. Maybe she bribed one of the vaqueros. You're both lucky I didn't burn it. Am I going to Dallas now? No. Dart. Yes? Make a few calls, put a man or two in that lobby. You're the boss. I want you and I to stay close to home, keep an eye on things. Things like Pete? Hey. If we can't beat the whites, maybe we could live with them. I could wear a dress. You'd look like a pea hen. Well, you looked like a baby deer when you started wearing your numupikapu. You can take me to the white world. Huh? I speak the language, though maybe I won't say nothing. I'll just let you walk me around. I want to see the looks on people's faces. Why are we talking about the white world all of a sudden? Tiehteti. We found signs of buffalo. North of here, I think. We have to follow. Tiehteti, come on. I'm tired of moving. You don't sound like yourself. We need you. More months of hardness ahead. Every warrior has to do their part. So then what? We can keep running from new things that are chasing us? Our people always move. You know this. Do you like that? Never sitting still? Never having a place you can call home. Every numunuu has lost someone they love. Your sadness can't be the end. You have to look forward. And hunt buffalo? Yes. And make arrows? Yeah. Help find another camp so we can keep moving? Get up. Everyone's waiting for you. Hey. Hola. Any luck? Turns out it's not my imagination. The foreman at Two Rivers says the old lady's man Eduardo called him, told him not to hire me. I have been... Blacklisted. No. I'd miss you. What'd you do, anyway? Hmm? To the old lady. It's one thing to fire you, but why have her man spread lies about you? It's... I dunno... Rencoroso. I was asking too many questions about my grandfather, Peter McCullough. As in...? Baby, you got about as much McCullough blood in you as I do. I'm telling the truth. Jeanne Anne McCullough's father is my grandfather. You're serious. I was working my way up to tell her. Well, it's good you didn't. If she thought you were sniffing around after all that oil money, she'd have done a lot worse than fire you. You don't know her. Do you have any idea how many Mexicans her people have buried on that ranch? Her people are my people. And that's my ranch. That's some dangerous talk there. I promised my Abuela Maria before she died that I would come here. That I would walk on her land, land that has been in her family for 200 years. She wanted me to see it with my own eyes, to learn the sounds, the smells. Well, you did that much. It's not enough. I know that she would've wanted me to fight. Mm-hmm. You heard something? Yes, I thought. There's a bobcat that comes around. We can't wait here forever. Endicott is sending men. Yeah. That's all well and good, but I wonder what they'll find when they get here. What do you mean? What if the McCulloughs get here first? Oh, they don't know this place. One of them does. He wouldn't. If the Colonel pushes him hard enough, trots out the wife and kids? Who knows what he'll do? Do you have to do that? Do what? Expect the worst of folks. I'm being realistic. Well, I don't like it. Bad outlooks beget bad outcomes. Why are you doing this anyway? What are you hoping to get out of it? Well, a job working for Standard, for starters. Keeping you alive, like I've done, keeps Mr. Endicott's lawsuit alive. He's liable to be grateful. And if everything lines up just right, I might earn enough to build myself a fine limestone house on this very spot. Get married again. You... You could have a brand new start again too. If you wanted it. I'll never have another family. Hi. We should talk. About what you saw. It'd be normal if you hate me a little. I don't. You and Daddy don't love each other. It's been plain awhile. You say it like it doesn't hurt you. Can't change it. Honey, I wish I could. God, it would be easier if your father and I were right for each other. Honey, I spent a lot of years trying to make that so. I don't know how to spend one more. I know being a mother is all I am to you. But there are other pieces of who I am. And those pieces, they've been missing, broken for awhile. And I'm trying to get 'em back. You gonna go off wandering, looking for some other family? No. Honey. No. Men get to go off and chase their dreams and make mistakes that no one will ever see. And we have to stay here and make mistakes in front of the people we love. Or at least I do. And I hope when you're my age, the world is kinder. My child. Have some buffalo. No. Come on, you need to eat. I don't want it. I know Toshaway came to talk to you. I know he said things. Tough things. Things he thinks you need to hear. I don't think anyone knows what you need to hear. Toshaway is a great chief. He doesn't know everything. Do what you have to. Now, here. You eat some, I'll eat the rest. Why'd we stop? Hey asshole. Hey. Hey, come on, now. Come... Oh, shit. Not again. Who are you? Your English is good. Better than yours. Looking for this? Oh, no. That thing's a piece of shit. Only works half the time. This... This, my friend, works every ti... Awww come on. White man, we're gonna kill you. Torture you first. Aw, don't do that. My people already think you're savages. Why give 'em any more fodder? By the way, your English, also very good. Answer my questions and I'll kill you quick. Well, progress is progress. What questions? How many of you are there? He asked you a question. I was thinking. I don't know, there are about a dozen or so in my group. But there are hundreds of groups of us scattered all across the damn state. How far? Well, I can't really tell exactly 'cause, sorry. But I get to walkin' when I drink, but if I'm not mistaken I think we made camp a couple miles due east. You sell out your people real fast, Mister. Captain. Hey, are you white? Oh, you are, aren't you? You know what you're worth, son? Anything else I need to know before my friend kills you? I think it's about ten o'clock. Nocona. Which means. I haven't been back to the camp all night and I wasn't there for breakfast. Which means. My men are looking for me. They have a standing order to find my gin puckered asshole if I'm not back by nine. So while you fellas were playing poke the drunk, about a half a dozen or so highly trained and very irritable United States cavalry officers have been searching for me. We are not far and I do cut a wide trail. So... You're a liar. Sometimes. But right now I got supplies and you got things to trade. What things? The boy. And that girl. U.S. Army pays a handsome bounty for the return of white captives. Army officers aren't allowed to keep ransom for themselves. Well, you are a smart one, ain't ya? Why don't you leave the details to me? We have a trade? They're not for sale. Hyah! Toshaway. They're coming. Now, why don't you let me talk to my men before they see you here? I got tracks. I think we found him. Nobody needs to die today. Hyah! Our orders are to relocate you Comanches. Which is a shit job, friends. You ever try rounding up bands of natives and herding 'em like cattle? Relocate us? To where? Oklahoma Territory. You have a patch of land. A place that is reserved for you. We go where we want. Sure you do, my friend, but not for long. My job is to put you behind a fence. But lucky for you, I am terrible at my job. Now, you gimme the captives and I'll forget we ever met. On top of that, I'll throw in two crates of tin beef, three horses and a rifle. That's a bad trade. I wouldn't say this in front of your people out of due respect. But you need everything that I have here and more. Toshaway. You can have the girl. I want them both. You can't have both. You can have the girl. She's a captive. The other one is a Comanche. Well, that's gonna cost you two horses and a crate of beef. No, it's gonna cost me one horse and a crate of beef. You're lucky you caught me with my pants down. - Teddy! - Sir. Bring the horses. Yes, sir. Darling? You ready to go? Yes sir. - Ready, sir. - Come on. It's a beautiful day. Yessir. Let's go out shootin'. Yessir. Good girl. You heard the story of how I left the Comanches. Well, I know that you had to leave so that you could save them. Mm-hmm. Everyone was starvin'. Small pox, cholera, other diseases they'd never seen and couldn't even name. There was no way they were gonna make it. I traded myself and Ingrid so the band could get supplies and medicines. You were a hero. In the story, yeah. You're saying it's not true? Oh, parts of it are, parts of it are not. Survivors write the history that suits them, Jeanne Anne. We fight hard for that right. One day it will be you who writes my story. What do you mean? This will all be yours. The ranch. The oil business. All of it. After your father and your uncle and I have passed, it will be you who build on whatever we leave behind. Me? Yup. Not Charles. Or Jonas. Oh, they'll own shares, but you'll be the one who's in charge. But I'm a girl. I have noticed. Yes. Why are you telling me this? Why now? It's time you understood where you fit into the greater scheme of things. Your place in this family. Oh. Why do you seem scared? Granddaddy... Mm-hmm. I have something to tell you. It is my honor to be here today, to open this center for future generations of Texans to understand our history. As my grandfather said, no matter what side you're on, there is one thing that never changes: Everyone will lay it on the line for the home they love. If... If this motley world of man has one thing in common, it's that. My grandfather was the sort of man God doesn't make anymore. He was fearless, loyal, endlessly innovative. He could teach himself any skill and survive any hardship... ...succeed at any endeavor. He was my hero. No story does him justice. In his later life, he learned that he had lung cancer. It was not in his nature to fade away, lying limp and frail in a hospital bed. No. He put on his best boots and a beaver felt hat. He pulled a Winchester 1886 from the gun closet and a couple hundred shells, and he drove to East Texas where the forests are thick with game. My granddaddy was the finest tracker. He cultivated the skill his whole life. So he marched into the thick, humid woods to track... a grown... male... bear. The largest one he could find. And he could tell from the tracks. He followed it for days, letting the bear pick up the scent of him. You see, he wanted the bear to know he was a formidable enemy. That they were matched. The most dangerous bear is an injured bear. He chose to die... ...in the Texas wilderness at the hands of the fiercest and most powerful animal in our state. Because he wanted to die with honor. And he chose to die that way to inspire us to live... To live more boldly. So we carry his spirit into the 21st century and beyond. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Yes, Ma'am? You see that Mexican? He doesn't belong here. Mexican kid with cropped hair at the back by the columns. Shouldn't be here... I need to talk to you. No. We're not doing that. Now you want to speak English so they don't understand? I understand. I'm saving you from shaming yourself. You said every warrior has to do their part. This is how I can do mine. What are you doing, Tiehteti? Hmm? I pushed you too hard to recover quickly. You can take more time. There'll never be enough. You're sad because of your dead wife, so you leave? This talk isn't like you. You think because you brought me here, because you forced me to live with you, you think you know me? Well, you don't! Be careful, Tiehteti. I did everything you wanted. And it didn't matter. I feel like... What? Say it. I feel like I lost my family all over again. We are your family. You're my son. And you're wrong, Tiehteti. I do know you. You want to leave because everywhere you look, you see reminders of what you lost. But you can't run from that. All the shadows that we don't want to see are scattered across this whole world. If you go, you're no longer a warrior. If you go, you lose honor. Hey! Come here a minute. You got anything you want to tell us? Such as? Where you're hiding not. Maria Garc?a. Stop for a second and think about your answer again. What's going on here? You tried to take my granddaughter away. I was trying to save my daughter from you. You killed Maria's whole family. No, you did. You banged on that family's door in the middle of the night and stirred up a good ol' panic. You got Pedro Garc?a itching for a fight like a back alley game cock. You are one crazy old man. You gave them false hope. You gave them time to prepare forces and marshal for a siege that was never meant to happen. If you hadn't gone there, they would've surrendered quietly and still be alive today. Their blood is on your hands as much as it is on mine. No. No! Enough! Enough! Enough. Enough. I'm gonna be a witness in her case. Tell them everything you did. And take away your children's birthright? Their home? Their land? I'm... I'm done, Daddy. Do your worst. It doesn't hurt me anymore. Go on, son. You take whatever horse you like from the barn and run. I will find you wherever you go. Eli! You came. I thought you'd stay with them forever. Well, lookie here. I guess Ol' Chief Toshaway really wanted that crate of beef, huh? You can collect the reward for me in exchange for two horses, the rest of the blankets you have to trade, one rifle, and a colt. A princely sum, that. You worth it? I've been living with the Comanches for almost four years. I learned their way. I learned their language. I know all their trails, all their campsites. I'm worth more than what I'm asking. Where you from, son? Near the Pedernales. Right across the settlement line. House burned down now. What's your Christian name? Do you even remember it. Why did you lie about your name? It's a fresh start for both of us. Eli. My real father's still out there. I don't want them taking me back to him. What happened? They know everything. I'm fine. Is that your father? I don't know. Get inside. Why don't you let me do the talkin', Pete? I'm Niles Gilbert and you are on my land. State your name and business or I will exercise my rights. Mr. Gilbert, my name is Joseph Dickerson and I'm an employee of Standard Oil of Pennsylvania. We're here to offer protection services for yourself and Miss Garc?a. Is she present?
