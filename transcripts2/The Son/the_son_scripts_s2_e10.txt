 Is that old junk worth dyin' over? You shouldn't a' come back here. I needed the money. You can reflect on the error of your ways all the way back to Mexico. Now sit. I'm calling security. When you gave that speech, you saw me at the back. So? You sent men after me. You didn't belong.

 I think maybe your family lied to you. I told you to sit... They lied about your grandfather. Eli McCullough was not killed by a bear. Ask me how I know. You keep back. You're not gonna shoot me. I am part of your family. My given name is Ulises McCullough. I said keep back! My grandfather was Pete McCullough. My grandmother was Maria Garc?a. Now put down the gun. Liar.

 Wait here. Mr. McCullough, this is not a formal deposition. There's nothing but friendly faces in this room. Please tell me what you know about Eli McCullough's criminal history. Well, where do I start? As far back as you can remember. I was nine years old the first time I saw my daddy kill a man. The Comanche Gringo. Welcome. Mr. Endicott. You look good for your age. Clean living and good whiskey. I find those things to be irreconcilable. I read you were a teetotaler. Well, you've done your research. How do you like the house? It's a fine piece of property. I bought it a couple of months ago anticipating my move into Texas. But now that move has gotten complicated... Some of my employees have disappeared without a trace. Buddy Monahan was your man and he declared war on me. He killed my cattle, sabotaged my business and splintered my family. What he did to my son Phineas cannot be undone. Well, I'm sorry to hear about your boy. Monahan crossed a line there. I won't deny that. He's a... He was a wild man. But to succeed in Texas I am told one needs a real Texan. Well, now, not all Texans are built the same way. There are those of us who take scalps... and then there's the other kind. Never seen one of these close up. Huh. Is this, uh, why you asked for a meeting with me? Am I supposed to feel intimidated? Where I come from, a scalp taken in battle holds great value. Now, I know you were told that to succeed in Texas you need a wild man. Well, this scalp here once belonged to such a man, until the day I took it from him. I'm not just any Texan. I'm its first born son. My whole life I've taken all comers. This is not the first scalp I've taken and it will not be the last. So who do you want to work with? A man who offers more than his biography. Well, no one can offer you my connections or my clout with the locals. I assure you, Mr. Endicott, I know the rules. And what are the rules exactly? A man who slaughters his opponents wins? That is Texas. Well, who am I to ignore the local customs? Leonard? Would you take Mr. McCullough out to some remote corner of this fine piece of property, put a bullet in his head, and bury him? Yes sir. I don't want to die here this way, but if that's the way the wind is blowing, I have prepared. Just yesterday, I updated my will. Yes, well, perhaps your beneficiaries will be easier to deal with than you were. Oh, I doubt that. I left the land, the oil, the leases... The whole kit and caboodle to the biggest oil tycoon there is. Bigger even than you. Mr. Edward Doheny. That's absurd. Do you even know Doheny? Well, of course not. But the will is legal and Mr. Doheny's not the kind of man to turn down an opportunity when it comes knocking at his door. An opportunity to humiliate and vex his most hated rival Roy Endicott. You would disinherit your own children out of spite? Well, I'm hoping it won't come to that. My father said that Pedro Garc?a had oil on his land. He didn't know about it. And he said that Judge Thaddeus Kilborne was gonna make it look like Mr. Garc?a was behind on his taxes. I asked... I'm sorry, Mr. McCullough. We must stop here. Why? The case is over. What? Mr. Endicott pulled the funding. You can't just do this. Monahan gave her his word that this would get done. If Monahan were still here, he'd a' done the same. You know this ain't right. How the hell did he pull it off? I had everything. I had Standard Oil. I had the best lawyers. I had you. You have to know you did everything you could. Stop. Stop, Peter. You're making it worse. Don't be kind. Why are you even here? You should be with them now. What do you want? I don't want anything from you. Bullshit. You want to talk about it? Maria? Everybody's out. You and I need to clear the air. How'd you do it? I handed the bigger man what he wanted and he let me keep a little piece for myself. That's what you achieved, son. You made me smaller. What now? We move on. That's it? That's it. Daddy. Why am I your favorite? I never asked for it. I don't want it. Why? You make me a better man. Get some rest. I'll go make lunch. So, these buffalo hunters finally find a town with a saloon. They order the two biggest plates on the menu. And what arrives is the most heavenly beef stew they've ever eaten. They ask the chef, they say, "Chef, what's in it?" And the chef says: "You wanna know-a my secret?" "I'ma tella you my secret." Every time I cook, in the pot, "I putta few special drops of oil from Italy." Then the chef walks away, and this man down the bar, he leans in and he says, "Italy's the name of his horse." I always love that one. Okay, enough of that. I would like us to raise a wrist... Here. - Hear, hear. - All right. A toast to young Master Eli Stevenson and his woman. Well... Oh, a little slower on the next one, son. I think that we would like to hear some tales of life among the Co-manch. Not much to tell. We were both taken from our families. Kept as slaves. Oh, it can't be as simple as all that. Well, old Chief Toshaway didn't want to let the boy loose, even when I offered him three horses. And I never heard tell of a slave they let carry a bow and a long knife. C'mon, give. He took me in as his son. Oh, sounds like you made quite a home for yourself. Did you have a woman? Did you get yourself a piece of cherry red? I had a wife. A wife? Hmm. Was she wild? I bet she was wild. I'm not gonna talk about her. Well, why the hell not? Leave it alone. I bet she was full of sweet savagery. Did you succumb, boy? Did she fall upon you tooth and claw? Eli, stop. Stop! Eli! Sit down. Oh! I have hit a nerve. Please, Eli. Sit down. So, tell me, Master Stevenson. You ever take a white man's scalp? 'Course not. Eli! Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt him! Eli! Eli! Get off! Look what I just found. You walk into any God-fearin' Texas town carrying a fistful of scalps, those people will kill ya. One day, you'll thank me for this. Please! Strip him. What's this? Mexican silver? Give it back! No. You got too much brown in you. I'm gonna have to cut that shit out. Se?ora McCullough? The Sheriff came by. What'd he want? He dropped this off for you. That'll be all, Rosa. Let's go. Yes, sir. Uh, we sent a car out there a little bit earlier. I'll be right outside, ma'am. Thanks, Clay. They get all the buckshot out of that leg? You know, you could have hit an artery. Lucky you, I didn't. Sit. Ulises. What were you thinking, robbing me? I have as much right to that stuff as you do. The Sheriff stopped by my house and dropped this off. How'd you get this? He give it to you himself? He gave it to his son, Emiliano... my father. Later, it came to me. Did you know him? I was very young when he died. But my father, when he got to drinking, he would tell me things about Abuelo Pete. Your father. What kind of things? He ran guns for the Carrancistas. What? S?. But he was more valuable to them for his contacts back in the States. He travelled back here. He came back? That's what I was told. Like a spy. Oh. Maybe that's bullshit. But he lived like a man who had nothing to lose. After the war he settled down. Became a proper ranchero. Got married. To Maria? That's right. They had two boys, eight grandchildren. They had a hacienda on the Gulf. They called him. Sounds like he was happy. He was free. You hungry? Drop the knife. I want the necklace. I said drop the knife. No. Stupid... Stay quiet. You gonna run? Oh, you don't have a plan. Stevenson, you are one dumb bastard. My name is McCullough. And here's my plan. Nobody's gonna take anything from me. Nobody's gonna hold my face in the dirt. I'm not your savage to tame. Shh. Shh. You hungry? You... Move out of the way, Pete. Move! Maria, put the gun down. I swear to God I'll shoot you if I have to. I'll shoot both of you if I have to! If you kill him you'll have to look over your shoulder the rest of your life. It's not worth it. You're defending him. Still? You're worse than he is. Thank you. Go get me some bandages for this shoulder. Go. Maria. Maria. Maria, wait. No! Shh. That was the most boring sermon in a long history of boring sermons. Don't blaspheme. I'm gonna go change. Gonna take out Poco Bueno. Can I come? As long as you, uh... stay out my way. All right. Give me a minute. I'll go out with you. Granddaddy makin' steak? Oh, my God. Stay here. Finn! Oh, no. No. Grandpa? Oh, Grandpa. Oh, my God. Come on. No. I thought he'd live forever. Never in a million years did I think he would die that way. No one did. It was like time stopped. Momma wanted to call the Sheriff, but my Uncle Phineas wouldn't let her. He kept stalling. Finn? He didn't die like this. Yeah, He did. No! The old man was too big for this. Caught unaware, shot in the back by a traitor. No, ma'am. We are the children of a legend. Legends do not bleed out in the dirt like a struck-down deer. Well, what are you suggesting? We say he was strong. We are strong. I want everyone from Percy Midkiff to Roy Endicott to know that the McCullough family stands unbeaten. 'Cause we are. The worst and the weakest of us have been purged. Peter McCullough is gone. We will never speak of him again. He said... From now on this family is together, undivided. "From now on this family is together, undivided." The next century is ours." Hmm. The Colonel always used to say if you're a good storyteller they'll follow you into the fire and thank you for the burns. ...explain where it happened. We needed a good story. The kinda story that people believe . ..heard someone stealing... 'cause they want to believe it. No, no. It shouldn't have happened here. We brought his body back from somewhere far away... From where? He was the best goddamned hunter in the whole state. Maybe there was an accident. It was no accident. He was sick. Knew his days were numbered... wanted to die with honor. Taking on the most dangerous animal that he could find. A bear. We don't have bears around here. They have them in the east. In the great Piney Woods. Eli McCullough. Having defeated his greatest foe. The great machine from the North. He could find no more men worth fighting. That's really good. He wanted to die fighting the only living thing as big as he was. We can say it's something the Comanches used to do. I told that story so many times... He wanted to get back to his roots. No, he wanted to inspire us. ...it became real. Oh, the details were so clear. It was like I was right there when it happened, watching him throw his gun to the ground and die like a Comanche hero. The truth is fragile. It dies quiet, dies easy. I've never told anyone this. It's okay. We're family. Hmm. How'd it go? Well, he has his take on all this, and I have mine. He seems good-hearted, though. What'll happen to him? Once he's healed enough to travel, we'll hand him over to INS for deportation. Mm. Normally. What do you mean, normally? I don't mean to pry, Mrs. McCullough. But it seems like you've got a connection to that young fella. Now, I only say that 'cause if you want, we can make all this go away. He'll walk out of here a free man. You are a sweetheart, Clay. But we have laws for a reason. And he will be better off with his own people. Just to be clear, Clay, this young man has no connection to my family. Uh, which young man would that be? I need me a Dr Pepper. We could have been free. That wasn't freedom. Eli, you can't kill everyone who crosses you. You can't run every time you decide you don't like where you are. Why not? No. Really, why not? Who's gonna stop me? Come on. I'm not going back to the Comanches, Eli. Me neither. I need something... I need something different. Go, go. Everybody back! Get back! Get back! There it go!
