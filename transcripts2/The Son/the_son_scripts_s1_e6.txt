 Pete: Tom Sullivan was family to me, to us. I grew up being rocked on his knee, sitting in front of him on his horse. And Daddy was gone most of the time, so it was Tom who taught my brothers and -- and me how to ride and shoot. And I can't think of a single good time I ever had on this ranch that didn't involve that man. I mean, he was there when -- when Sally and I got married... -Man: Amen.

 ...was there when the kids were born. I watched you guys grow up on his knee just like I did. He was there for all the bad times as well. Man: Yes, he was. He was there that day the Apache killed my -- my mother and my brother. He was the reason Phineas and I survived. He fought like a mother bear to protect us. Man: Quite a soldier. He saved us... Man: Nobody better. ...and I couldn't save him. And some of you might say to me, "Well, Peter, he forgives you." Right now he's living in a place

 where the streams run clear... ...and the grass is up to your chest, the horses never get tired. -Man: That's right. That's right. I don't know if any of that is real. I used to think someone was watching over us, but these days, when I look around, I'm not sure about that. I'm finished. Please, carry on, Brother. Minister: Of course. Can I go, too? No, you give me a moment with your daddy. There's a good girl. Minister: A reading from Revelation. "And I heard a voice from Heaven saying, blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." Perhaps you should go away for a spell. Go up to Austin, see your wife. I don't think that's a good idea. I'm not a source of comfort for her. It ain't her I'm worried about. Your children need a daddy. This ranch needs a leader. So whatever it takes to get your head right, you better do it. Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir. Indians, right? Apache. You know this story? Daddy says I'm not allowed to hear it all till I'm older. Well, you look old enough to me. ** It was 1881. Your daddy was about 4 or 5. There hadn't been an Indian raid for a long while, so I thought we were safe. I'd gone up to Wichita on some cattle business, and when I'd got back, Sullivan had buried your grandmother and your Uncle Everett. However... he did save your daddy and Uncle Phineas. I took some vaqueros, and we hunted down that band of Apaches and killed them. All of them? Well, not exactly. There was one survivor, a young boy. The last of his kind. After it was over, we headed back home. When we got to the river, we saw that that Apache boy had been following us with his bow. For 20 miles, he kept up with men on horseback. For 20 miles, he'd been running to his death. A child like that... A child like that would've been worth a thousand men today. Where is he now? I left him standing at the riverbank. Far as I know, he's looking for me yet. ** Man: We are living in a historic moment, gentlemen. You will tell your children and grandchildren about this terrible time of violence. No, thanks. No, thank you, darling. So the piano player turns out to be her husband and he had a shotgun. Tom busts out of there, buck naked, and ran all the way back through the ranch. Oh, I must've spent half the night picking burrs out of that man's ass. The mark of a true friend. To Tom Sullivan, may he rest in peace. Hear, hear. How are you holding up? Ah. Not great, obviously. Do you wanna talk about it? Pedro: Maria... Sí, Papá. Sorry for your loss. Thank you, sir. Niles: Our house is destroyed, our brother's gunned down, and yet, we prevail. We must mourn Tom Sullivan as we find strength in ourselves. We all have a responsibility to ensure this never, ever happens again. Excuse me. Damn shame what those sediciosos did to this find house of yours. I'm more worried about my brother. Like I said, damn shame. Which one is Ramon? He's right there. Louis: What'd Ramon do? He helped the sediciosos. Led them to this very doorstep. He's having a high old time, ain't he? He shouldn't be here. Well... maybe somebody oughta tell him that. Hey, Ramon, y'all probably ought to get goin'. What's wrong? Do I gotta spell it out? I've known Sully a long time, Charles. If I could take that bullet for him, I would've done it. Bullshit. Browns stick with brown. The sedicios held me at gunpoint. I led them in circles until we ran into the Colonel. Of course that's what you say now. Hey, this is the whiskey talkin'. Let's all stay calm. It's okay. His house. I know you ain't walking away from Colonel McCullough's grandson when he's talking to you. Out of the way, Louis. I prefer "sir." I don't say "sir" to your kind. You better watch yourself, son. ** Hey! I said knock it off. Step back! Get back! Keep your place! What the hell's going on here? We were set upon by your men. Your son showed great potentiality for heroism. Niles! Time to go. He should be rightly lauded. I want you to apologize to Ramon. That's not necessary, Mr. Pete. It was an accident. Oh, no. Our men are family. That's -- that's how we treat 'em. I want you to apologize. Now. Listen to your daddy. I apologize, Ramon. ** Shit. Help! Help me! Help me. What the hell's going on here? The Comanches got me. They killed my family. Are they still around? They following you? No. I left them a few days ago. They think I'm dead. Don't worry, kid. We'll keep you safe. You hurt? No. All right, well, come on. You're welcome to join our little camp. Take a load off your dogs. This'll be ready in a few minutes. Come on, sit down, get some food in you. Don't worry, kid. It'll be all right. ** You're safe now. Mister, you better run. I'm serious. -Oh! You little son of a bitch! Grab your rifles! Aah! Man: I'm a Christian. I have God on my side. What're you doing? Goddamn savages. ** You've earned this, Tiehteti. We eat this winter because of you. You did good. Man: No. What are you doing? What are you doing?! No! Please, no. No! [Axe thudding, man continues screaming] I'm Eli. People here call me Tiehteti. It means "pathetic white boy." You should eat something. Starving yourself just makes it worse. Whether you eat or not, they expect you to work. What's your name? Ingrid. What kind of accent is that? German. What are you doin' here? I left home with my parents during the war. Which war? The March Revolution. A man sold us some land here. We came with 20 other families. Nobody told you about the Indians? We were told they were only stories. Where'd you learn how to do that? You're good at it. ** About a year ago, my parents were killed by the Apache. I was taken. The Buffalo hunters visited our camp and they traded for me. They were going to take me back to civilization. I was almost free. I'm so sorry. You didn't cause this. You're just a captive like me. Right? I was the one that found your camp. I thought I was doing the right thing. Like I said, I'm sorry. You led them to us. How's Jonas? Healin' up. Gracias. He's out of danger. He's at this fancy new hospital in Austin. 45 beds. Hmm. Sally's up there with him. That must be lonely for you. It's okay. We needed a little time apart. I don't think you came here to see my father. I know the real person I should be thanking is you. You're the one who convinced him to come to our rescue. Had to be. It was obvious what had to be done. So that's all this is? A thank-you visit. That's all. You know I can tell when you're lying. Well, I know you think you can. It's strange, sitting here and drinking coffee with you. Familiar. Yeah. That's a better word for it. So I guess you don't think much of the old days, huh? Nope. Me neither. Okay, Chestnut, we need to retrace our steps exactly. You got that? It's real important. We're gonna find that oil seep. Of course we are. I believe in you, baby girl. Where you goin'?  Come on. ** I don't remember any of this. None of it looks familiar. Goddamn! Damn. Well, put yourself back where you were, Jeanne Anne. You were running away. What did you feel? What did you hear? Gunfire... coming from the ranch. So I'm guessing you would've looked for cover, which would've led you that way. Yeah. Come on. I think I know why those bandits came after us. Oh? The man in the shed. Hmm. Do you care to elaborate? I saw the man in the shed. He had blood all over him. Daddy put him in the truck and just drove off. Anything your daddy's ever done, he's done for the good of this family. Don't ever forget that. The Garcías think we killed him. Did we? The world's a dangerous place, honey. Your daddy and I tried to protect you from that, but now that you've seen it, you've got a choice. You can either curl up in a little ball or make yourself stronger. Hmm. Somebody help me! Help! Please, God, help me! No, no, no. Please. Is anyone there? Can anybody hear me? Can anyone understand what I'm saying? Help me. Leave that. Walk with me. Help me. Help! You pity the new captives. I don't. You do. The buffalo hunter lost his honor when we caught him. Torture is a chance for him to get it back. Instead, he cries and screams. I think Comanches just like torture. All people like torture. White people, too. Nobody I know would do that. I've watched Rangers kill children in front of my eyes. "Little Indian becomes a big Indian." That's a saying among white people, right? It's how all people fight -- believing the enemy's not human. What about my mother and sister and brother? They weren't your enemies. They weren't hurting anybody. We've been on that land since the beginning of time, and yet, you decided it was your own. Did you not think that we would fight to take it back? Because when I steal something from someone, I expect they will want to kill me. White people, they do not. They think everything in this world rightfully belongs to them. They think they're entitled to rob and cheat. All the white people I've ever met tried to steal our land. And yet, I have never met a white man who didn't look surprised when I killed him. Man: Please help me. Help! You deserve whatever happens to you! You're animals! This could be the end of you. The Lord will see to it! ** Somebody help me! Help! Is anyone there? What's wrong? Man: Can anyone help, please? Can you not hear him out there? Are you upset because he's white? I don't know. It's not good to discuss this with anyone, even me. Man: Help me. I just wanna know how you feel about it. Man: Help me. ** Can anyone hear me? I wasn't born into this band. I was born into the Penateka -- honey eaters. What happened? The white Texans attacked our camp. The men were away, and... it was just women and children. They killed everyone. They picked up my baby brother by the neck and bashed his head against a rock. They cut my mother's head off, stuck a spear between her legs. My sister and I...ran. We hid in the bushes, and we watched them kill everyone in our camp. But why would they do that? They want our land, 'cause no matter how much they have, it's not enough. You wanna know how I feel about the buffalo hunter being in pain? I'm glad. A McCullough has entered the bar. Louis, libate this man post-haste. Sit you down, son. How you feelin' this fine afternoon? Fine, I guess. This young man has weathered a difficult spell. We'll open the Gold Medal. The South's most illustrious liquor traveled 1,500 miles to get here. Thank you, sir. It is our pleasure, Charles, to offer hospitality to one of our comrades when he needs it most. Now that's more like it. Thank you very much, Louis. To your future. Ooh. Now you see, that is it exactly. I knew you and I were alike in this way. Our souls feel so damn responsible to heal the social ills. But we are buoyed by righteousness. And yet, can you believe your daddy frets I'm putting wrong thoughts in your head? The hell with my dad. That's some phraseology. I can't believe he made me kiss Ramon's brown ass in front of everyone on the ranch. True. Your daddy never should've done that. It was a shame you did not deserve. It's like his head is screwed on backwards these days. I can't explain him. Son, your daddy does not define you. ** And I will admit, I have always had more in common with your granddaddy than with anyone else in your family. I've done a fair bit of work for him, in fact. What kind of work? The kind your paterfamilias lacks the stomach for. Tell me, Charles, does it not bother you that one of your own vaqueros led the greaser bandits to your front door? Hell, yeah, it bothers me. But there's not much I can do about it, though. Well, I respectfully disagree. If you give a man a lever and a place to put it, he can move the world. ** Man: Please, God, kill me! Kill me! Can anyone hear me?! Can anyone help? It's okay. I'm here to help you. This'll all be over soon. ** Hey, Ramon. Charles Yep. What are you doing way out here? I'm taking back that apology. Come on, Charles, time to go. ** No! Luisa! Luisa! You said we were just gonna scare him. Oh, he's plenty scared. There's no doubt on that front. Would the suspect please explain how he led a gang of killers to the door of our community's most prominent citizen? Charles, please. You know I wouldn't do this. I believe him. Let him -- let him go. This is about justice, Charles. I said let him go! Would the suspect please explain how he turned his employer's family over to the sediciosos? Niles, come on. How he got numerous members of our community killed or wounded. I would never betray your family, Charles. Please let him down! Please! I like Ramon just as much as you do, but it is the message that matters. Stop! Please stop! Relax, son. There's a science to this. All right, come on. Yeah. Now you listen to me, Ramon. This is your last chance. You confess, and we'll take you to the sheriff... ...and you can have your day in court. But either way, you've got to answer for what you did. Charles... I forgive you. Don't you let that copper-belly mess with your head. Bring him up. No! No! No! Get him! No! No! No! Hey! Hey! I don't like this any more than you do. Pete: Charles? I was worried about you. I'm all right. Have you been drinking? Hey, wait up. I'm sorry I scolded you in front of the others. I never should've done that. My head was messed up because of Sullivan and, uh... Are you all right? I'm fine. Jeannie: Yes. I heard people and rode straight into here. This is it. ** -Go right ahead. Let me see. I've spent my whole life building something to leave to my family, Jeanne Anne, and oil is the only way I can keep it. Now a goddamn miracle has happened. We found a spot with so much oil, it can't even stay underground. And it's a mile on the wrong side of my neighbor's fence. **
