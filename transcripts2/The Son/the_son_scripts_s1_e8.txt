 I didn't mean for that to happen. That's not why I came over. I didn't think that. I need to go. No, hey. Stay. I have no business being here, Peter. You're married. Sally and I are over. There's nothing left between us. I've heard this kind of talk before.

 I mean it. Th-- This is different. I promise. Stay. Here? In your house? I gave the help the day off. I'm not sneaking around like we used to. I'm just too old for it. Just have dinner with me. Let me explain. Explain what? Anything. Anything you need explained. ** ** ** **

 ** ** So, I told him, "Amigo, if you want me to put my finger there, you'll need to put a ring on it first." Kelly: What'd he say to that? He turned bright red and offered to pay me double. Oh! Well done, my girl. So, did you take the money? Oh, what do you think? Call and raise. Belle: Good afternoon, my soiled doves. Afternoon, Mama. Anybody feel like a bit of travel? Kelly: Mm. No more Aggie parties. Them college boys wouldn't know gratuity if it bit them on the pecker. No, this is a high-born affair -- one of Thaddeus Kilborne's Honey Hunts. Wall-to-wall ranchers and oil men, Patillo Higgins, the Chapmans, Bill Sterling. And rumor has it that Colonel Eli McCullough, himself, is gonna put in an appearance. Well, la-di-da. Belle: Kilborne put the word out to al the boarding houses. Anybody interested? ** I'll go. Lena's in. Anybody else? Oh, no, thank you. Last time I got my ass bit by chiggers. Anybody? Oh, come on, gals. You might catch yourself a rich husband. Or he might catch Lena's social blisters. He'd be a lucky fella if that's all he gets. There you go, Miguel. You know what to do. Thank you. Finn! Good to see ya, boy! Oh, glad you could make it. Oh, wouldn't miss it. It's quite a setup here. Well, it is that. Kilborne's daddy was a property speculator. Made all his money selling bad lots to settlers. What was wrong with them? Well, it just happened it was smack in the middle of Comanche territory. -Oh. -Hold still, Miguel. It looks like history's forgotten the details. -Don't jerk. -Well, it always does. It's a nice spread, though, isn't it? Curran: Stop shaking, damn it. May I? Colonel McCullough? Mm. Of course. Be my guest. Man: That was a hell of a shot! Colonel? That's my bow. Indeed it is. Have you eaten? Nah, famished. Good. You're just in time for lunch. ** Kilborne: Colonel! Ah, Judge Thaddeus Kilborne. A laudable affair you've put together here. My pleasure. Is this your boy I heard so much about I'm the other one. Phineas. It's a pleasure, Your Honor. -Oh, call me Thaddeus. I do hope you plan to stick around for the Honey Hunt tonight. Well -- Wouldn't miss it for the world. His brother's married, but this one here, he's a legendary cocksman. Ah. Well, my daddy exaggerates my exploits. Oh, attaboy. Admit to nothing. Colonel. -Thaddeus. I suppose that was necessary. Welcome, boys, you all gettin' enough right? Better safe than sorry. Not that I don't love the drunk assholes of San Antone, but why did you call me here? Misery loves company. No, really. Why'd you call? I found an oil seep. Had it tested. Sweet crude. So, what's the problem? It's on Pedro García's land. ** Does he know? Well, I thought it best to keep it under my hat. All right, well, what's the plan? Same thing the McKinneys did. Same thing everybody does. Thank you. Yeah, but Pedro's not some illiterate dirt farmer. He'll contest it, and he'll win. Not if he's gone. I'm trying to figure out what you're suggesting here. Well, that's Pedro's problem. I'm hoping he'll be reasonable. About as reasonable as you'd be if someone were trying to chisel you out of your land? Do you think we have a choice here? When does the rest of that money from Midkiff run out? Christmas... if we're careful. In the meantime, we're still waiting for that new rig to arrive. And once it does show up, how long is it gonna take us to hit oil? Months We're building something here, Finn, you and me -- a legacy. You know that, right? The future we want... ...the future we're working toward... ...it won't happen unless we make it happen. And that García land -- it's a sure thing. ** All right, then. What do we do about Pete? Keep him out of it. He'll find out soon enough. Well, not that soon. I sent him up to Austin. What? He and Sally had a big fight. He'll be back at the ranch by now. Shit. We can talk to him. You think so? The last time I checked, Maria García was still a member of that family. Well, that all happened a long time ago. Well, your brother doesn't let things go that easy. Keep him in the dark. What happened with Sally? She's gonna stay in the city, where she's happy. It's where she belongs. And is that what you both want? Yeah. So you're gonna stay here alone? I figure, so long as we can hang onto this place. What about your kids? Want some wine? All our wine glasses got shot up, so we'll have to make do with these. ** I don't know how I'll survive without seeing the kids every day. Truth is, they're better off in the city... ...and safer. ** It's different with Eli. ** ** Your Honor? Might I trouble you for a moment? Well, sure thing, son. Do you think this little soiree has been a resounding success, or what? I thank you for that. So, you got any aces in that basket there? Well, you'll have to have a look. Well, now. It's a gift from the Colonel. What does he need this time? Well, Your Honor... there are a few records in your office we would like to have altered. I'm listening. The García tract. Pedro hasn't paid his taxes in 10 years now, and the penalties have added up substantially. In fact, it's probably time for a sheriff's sale. Hell. I'm sure glad you're not my neighbor. How much is in there? $5,000. Pedro García has always paid his taxes on time. We know that. He'll have records and receipts, but I guess you know that, too. We do, sir. We are rotten, aren't we? I mean, how much does one man need? I-I got a piece of land here the size of Delaware, but I see a pile of money, I can't stop myself from picking it up. I'll take that as a "yes." Let's make this payment the first half, rest due upon completion of the task, hmm? Yes, sir. Boy. Thank you. So... were you serious before? I get to ask whatever I want? Sure. Have there been other women? Besides me? Not once I got married, no. What about before? I was a kid. I know. I remember. But I couldn't have been your first. My father took us to a whorehouse when I was 14 in Mexico. Did you like it? I was a 14-year-old boy in a whorehouse. What do you think? And then I met you. And? No "and." You were my girlfriend. I was faithful. Until you got married. Yeah. Then I got married. Why did it mean so much to your father? Why Sally? He liked that her family was respectable. I don't understand it. Me neither. You want me to ask him for you? No. What about you? Well... you were my first. But then I moved to New York, and... there were others. Too big a number for a lady. When I was younger, I always...wondered why I didn't get pregnant. I watched all of my friends dealing with it all the time. But... then I just realized maybe I couldn't get pregnant. Maybe I can't. Does that bother you? Not at all. ** Why don't you want to get married? I want to choose. You want freedom... and yet you own a slave. I find that funny. Nobody asked you to be here. If you wanted to be free, you should have stayed where the white people come from. Eli is probably there right now. I hope he's sleeping in a big feather bed tonight, two pillows under his head. What's a "feather bed"? Heaven. I don't understand. No! Of course you don't. 'Cause you're just a disgusting savage. Go on. You can hit me for saying that if you want. It's okay. I know it makes you feel strong. It's the only power you have left, isn't it? You and me, we are not so different. I've been a slave for a while now, and I've learned a few tricks. When your new husband is putting his baby in you, it might help you to think of a happy memory from your past. Maybe that would be a good time for you to remember Eli. ** So, what happened with your husband? Henry left me...when I couldn't give him a baby. But it's okay. He wasn't a good man. I was stuck. You know that? We were living in a tenement in Greenwich Village. We shared a bathroom with the whole floor. I had to pawn my wedding ring to get a ticket home. You could've contacted me. I would've helped you. Really? You would have wired me money? Behind Sally's back? I would've done something to help you, Maria. Come on. You have to know that. I thought we were gonna get married. And then you left me... for a woman you just met. It was awful for me, too. I missed you all the time. I hated my father putting me in that position. Yeah. I'm sure you suffered. You had a life. You could do whatever you wanted. I don't have any of your choices. I have no money, no skills, no way to survive on my own. Do you not understand that? ** You're right. I haven't been fair to you. I wish I could take that time back, do it all different. Well, you can't. No, I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Kilborne: Are you here to shoot quail?! No! No! Are you here to hunt duck? No! No! God damn right, you're not. It is with enormous pleasure that I welcome y'all to Thaddeus Kilborne's Third Annual Honey Hunt! Now, each of these fine ladies has a basket with a bottle of bourbon... -Yeah! -...a pecan pie... -Yeah! -...and a blanket... so you don't get burrs on your trousers. We'll let these ladies get a little head start, and then we'll start huntin'! That's right, we can't make it too difficult for them. You speak to Thaddeus? Yeah. How'd it go? Easiest meeting of my life. Ah. Second thoughts? It is what it is. Well, given the situation... Yeah. We should split up. Probably for the best. ** Man: Where you going? Come back here! Lily: Well, well! Lucky you. Hi. Wanna sit? Uh, that's a lovely invitation, but I think you'd prefer one of the other gentlemen who's about to come this way. Oh, I don't know. You look pretty handsome to me. And what happened to your wedding ring? You lose track of it? Tragically, I have not yet met the right young lady. Maybe that's about to change. We're not stepping off this blanket until I make you forget... every... woman you've ever been with. Your ambition does you credit, ma'am. You like this? Who doesn't like kisses? They are very pleasant. How 'bout this? That is, uh... That's very kind of you. Well...how 'bout this? You just relax... and pretend I'm someone else. You are Colonel Eli McCullough, right? Guilty as charged. I don't speak Comanche. But you knew enough to recognize it. Who are your people? Not Comanche. But I think you might know them. What's this about, honey? There's easier ways to get money off me. I'm not here for money. I'm Lipan Apache. ** From Mexico. Near Villa Union? You and your men came into my village. You killed everyone you could find, except my father. You know what's funny, is I wasn't even sure you would remember. I remember him well. That was a long time ago. I was a different man then. And your father and his people killed my wife and son. An entire village for your wife and son?! That war's long over. Come and sit down. We have more in common than you think. Stop. Tell me your name. Man: Eli?! ** Oh, God. Help. Help! I've been shot! ** Young Eli: Can't hold them all. Can you even count all the lives you've ended? What's happening here? Are you a message from The Great Spirit? That Apache gal -- pretty sure that was a message. She just wanted me dead. That's a hell of a message. Get on the horse. I'm not ready. You're a loaded gun, old man. It's a better world without you in it. Easy there. Come on. We'll do it together. Phineas: Can you hear me? Don't look back. Hang on. Hang on, Daddy. Don't look back. Hold on, Daddy. We're gonna get you to a doctor, okay? Hang on, Daddy! I gotcha! Daddy?! Hold on. We're gonna get you to a doctor, okay? Okay, but tell us, you gotta tell me what happened. I'm fine. Well, who did this?! Tell me! Who did this to you?! I don't know. I didn't see the fella. Well, he shot you in the chest! How did you miss seeing him?! It was dark! Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't just stand there! Come on! Go get some help! Get a truck started! We gotta get him outta here! ** ** It'll be light soon. Shh. I gotta go. No. Mm, I'll have to invent some story. I'll have to tell them that I spent the night at a friend's house. You're a grown woman. I'm still their daughter. Hell with that. Get your things. Come on. What? You don't want anyone telling you what to do anymore, how to live your life... so come on, let's go. You're joking. We got some money in the safe upstairs. We'll head up to Montana. I'll get work there as a hand. Let's leave right now. No. Never come back. Do-- Don't. You can't say that to me. It's not fair. I love you. ** I'm not running off with a married man, Pete. So put that out of your head. Okay. So, what are we gonna do? ** Who is it? Pedro García. It's not locked. Come on in. How are you, amigo? Can I get you something? I can make a pot of coffee. No. I won't stay long. Maria was out all night. I believe she was here. I'm a married man, Pedro. Whatever you think is going on, I believe you're mistaken. My daughter... she's a widow. She's sick with grief and not responsible for her actions. A man who takes advantage of this... is not a man at all. I'm not taking advantage of her. You really believe that? With all my heart. When I knocked on your door today, I left my pistol in my car. Next time I come, it will be in my hand. ** ** Phineas: Hey, what's the verdict, Doc? Got all the fluid out of his lungs, but if he moves around too much, his lung will collapse again, and it'll probably kill him. Make sure he takes it easy. -Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you for everything you've done. Appreciate it. You're gonna make it, okay? Just hang in there. ** ** ** **
