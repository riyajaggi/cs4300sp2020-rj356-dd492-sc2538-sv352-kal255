 Sally: The doctors say he's about six weeks from being back on his feet. Oh, I've been thinking about him all day. H We've finally got him settled. Thank God, they let us move him back to the house. He's doing better already. When are you and the kids coming up? Pete? I-I can't leave right now, Sal. Half our cattle are running loose, the house looks like a war zone.

 We got repairmen in and out of here all day. Your son nearly died in the hospital! Don't do this. You haven't bothered to come see him. All the nurses just assumed I was a widow 'cause my husband wasn't there. If you got something to tell me, try saying it plain. I want my kids here with me. Is that plain enough for you? These calls cost us a fortune. Goodbye. [Birds chirping, cows lowing in distance] Any idea what this is about? No.

 Morning, fellas. Teo, what's going on? Mr. Pete, uh... I'm very sorry... but we're here to give notice. Notice? All of y'all? Sí. Teo, you've been with us, what, 20 years? Jorge, Tomas, you were both born on this ranch. It's -- It's too dangerous for us here. We've been through a rough stretch, no denyin' that, but we're takin' precautions now. Things are gonna get better. Better? Mr. Pete, Ramon was hanged last night. We -- We were sure you'd heard. No. No. Who done it? You know? The Law & Order League. ** Where were you last night? We should pay for the funeral. We'll do more than that. Ramon grew up here. We're gonna make sure Luisa's taken care of and those kids get educated. You realize Niles is a monster we helped create? You mean me. I'm not pointing fingers. I'm just sayin' we can't let this pass by without taking some kinda action. I promise you, Niles Gilbert's gonna suffer for this. But now is not the time. So when? Accounts will be balanced. You have my word. What do we do about Charles? Talk to the sheriff? Nobody knows he was there. Let's just leave it at that. Niles knows. All those other jackasses know. Safe to say, they ain't talking. I think it's best to get Charles out of town for a spell, let this thing settle down. I don't want to go to Austin. You wanna see your mama and Jonas, don't you? Uncle Phineas? Why are we in such a rush? What aren't you telling me? Jeannie, please get in the truck. Not until somebody tells me what's going on! Bug. Can't we wait for Granddaddy? Jeannie Anne McCullough, you get in the truck right now, or I'll take a strip off your hide. Get. What the hell did you do? ** ** ** ** ** [Indistinct conversations, horses whinnying, clanking] ** [Indistinct conversations, horses whinnying] Didn't work. Cut your arms wrong. Will you show me how to do it the right way? Don't think so. No. Please. Ingrid, you have to try. That's what we all have to do. It's easy for a boy to say that. For me, there's no future. Only thing I am good for is abuse. Whatever torture and humiliation they can come up with. Then one day, I'll be pregnant. I promise to look after you. I reckon I can do a better job of that. You want to help me, Eli? Kill me. Right now. Please? Please, Eli? You're the reason I'm here. You owe me. Be a man and use your knife. Stop it! What are you afraid of?! That you'd have to pay my owners back? That you'd have to give them a couple of horses? I don't have any horses. Captives get ransomed back to the whites all the time. Especially girls. Won't matter. I'm not a virgin anymore. No one will want me. No one will marry me. I'll marry you. I mean, if n-- if nobody else wants you. You're crazy. Probably. ** Maria, what are you doing?! Ramon's wife shouldn't have to walk through town and see these flyers everywhere. Maria! This is -- this is disgusting. Come on! Maria. Well, good morning, Widow García. You are starting your day with some destruction of property, I see. You hanged a man, and now you're throwing a party. Well, that's a... that's quite a serious accusation. The way I heard it, Ramon Sanchez ran afoul of his sedicioso compadres. It is common knowledge that Mexicans are a violent race, descended from conquistadors. Tell me -- How many Indians did your ancestors butcher in order to acquire that fine ranch of yours? That's tellin' her, Niles. Let the lady answer. I don't know. Probably as many as yours did. The difference being that you've risen higher on the backs of the oppressed than I. And now you stand here before me and you malign my reputation in front of my friends. ** If that is the character of a high-born, you can't blame the common man for restoring the balance. You can keep those. Lord! We got boxes more. What you got there? Just a gift for our young invalid. That's sweet. What happened? Pete and I aren't doing well. Tell you what. Get yourself dressed. After I give this to Jonas, I'm taking you out to dinner. You can tell me everything. I don't know if I feel like going out. I'm not giving you a choice. Go on, now. Make yourself look pretty. Do not disappoint me. Hey! Hey! Hey! Ow! Why were you talking to Dirty Hair? I was trying to make her feel better! Why? I'm trying to keep her from killing herself. Ow! Stop doin' that! You're stupid! S-She's your slave. Don't you want her to stay alive? She's my father's slave. He's trying to meet my bride price so my father will let him marry me. Oh. It's better for us if she dies. Better for you, better for me. A strong stallion. Make a good gift to Prairie Flower's father. Good for them. Wohonuu Makwiyetu says he'll collect 10 more and give those to her father, too. Does that make you angry? Not really. Stop lying. You want to kill him. You want Prairie Flower for yourself. And she wants you -- I think. You can't fool me, Tiehteti. I'm smarter than you. Remember that. So what do I do? Her father's a kind man. He wants his daughter to be happy. I don't think he'll force her to marry if there's another warrior she loves. But I'm not a warrior. Well, now, you can become one. Take scalps, collect horses. Let the people know in your heart, you're a Comanche. And stop talking to Dirty Hair. Her father has many wives. They're always hungry. You should take him some meat. Come on. I'll help you. Eli? Are you hungry? You look hungry. Here. It's from the buck you killed. You ain't my slave. You belong to Prairie Flower. You ain't got no business giving away her food. Go! Stay away from me. Hurt you to say that? What does it matter? I know why you said it. That's why it matters. My father appreciated the deer. I'll come to your tipi tonight. ** Quail gun? It's in the back. Rifle? Packed your .351 and the 30-30. Ya mind if I ask where you're headin'? Securing the future of our household. I have never eaten like that. Do you buy every dinner date oysters and champagne and chocolate soufflé? Only the pretty ones. Come on. This was nice. Thanks for the fine evening. Oh. Well, no. I just... Do we have to go back already? Oh, let's get a drink somewhere. Ah, one drink. There's a good spot around the corner. Take me to one of the places that you go. Where you go with your friends. I don't think you'd like it. Let me surprise you. Okay. * The ballroom was filled with fashion's throng * * It shone with a thousand lights * * And there was a woman who passed along * * The fairest of all the sights * * A girl to her lover then softly sighed * * "There's riches at her command" * * "But she married for wealth, not for love," he cried * * "Though she lives..." Howdy, Anders. How are you this fine evening? Well, happy to see you, Finn, as always. And who is this ravishing siren? Anders, meet Sally. Any friend of his is welcome here with open arms. Only have one rule here -- The most beautiful creature in the room gets free champagne. * ...sad when you think of her wasted... * I can't believe he's flirtin' with me. Well...he can fancy ya and not fancy ya, if you know what I mean. Oh, I see. * And her beauty was sold Thank you. * For an old man's gold Fred: Evening, ma'am. May I buy you a drink? Anders is taking good care of us. Oh, he always has fine taste. I'm Fred. Victoria. We're visiting from New York. B-Bradley...Henderson. Good to meet you, Mr. Henderson. Welcome to Austin. Oh, and I'm -- I'm from here. Just showing her around town. And how do you like it? Oh, well, we're just having the best time. Uh, this turned out to be the perfect place to celebrate. Oh. What's the occasion? Today is our anniversary -- 20 years. Congratulations! I'm a lucky man. So sweet, you two. What else do you have planned? Well... um, we have to go back to Manhattan and change out our trunks. 'Cause we'll need coats for the ship to Capri. We're meeting friends there next month. Victoria... you have made my evening. Forgive us, Fred. I'd like to dance with my husband. No forgiveness necessary. * Beautiful doll * You great big beautiful doll * * If you ever leave me, how my heart will ache * * I want to hug you, but I fear you'd break * * Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa * * Oh, you beautiful doll * Just a song at twilight * When the lights are low That man earlier -- Fred. Yeah? You know him. Yes. Then he knew my story was a lie. I promise he thoroughly enjoyed you. * Sad the day and long * Still to us at twilight I'm glad you've found someone. * Comes love's old song Thank you. * ...sweet song Your life... it seems so wonderful. You're always so confident. It's hard to believe you and Pete grew up in the same house. * Still we can hear it at the close of day * I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable. No, it's... Truth is, I'm not that confident. * Love will be found... This -- This club is my hiding place... the one small patch of Earth where I'm free. * Just a song before twilight It's good to share it with someone that I love. * And the flickering shadows * Softly come and go Sally. * Though the heart be weary * Sad the day and long * Still to us at twilight... I never kissed anyone but Pete before. * ...love's old song I just wanted to see what it was like. * ...love's old sweet song You're worried I won't get married again, aren't you? I want to see you happy. That's not an answer. What do you want me to say? You refuse to dress like a widow. All the world sees is a grown woman living with her parents. It looks like there's something wrong with you. Your father knows a widower in Carrizo Springs. A kind man. He owns a clothing store. I think you'd like him. Is this kind man also very old? It's true he's not young. But, then again, neither are you. ** That's a terrible thing to say. Jeannie! Jonas! Hey! Jonas! Be careful. I'm sorry. Does it still hurt real bad? I'm okay. Hey. Hey. Hi, Daddy. This is such a nice surprise. Mama's gonna be so sad she wasn't here to greet ya. Where is she? Out with Uncle Phineas. Don't worry -- Valentina's here. Well, let's send her home. You should be getting to bed, don't you think? Jeannie, go find her, please. Yes, sir. Charles, hang back a minute. I thought... we were going to bed. You and I should have a word first. ** Pete: I don't know what I can say to you, Charles. I'm sorry. "Sorry" don't help Ramon. Didn't you learn anything at the river? When the ranch got shot up? You know how bad things are. You know better than getting caught up with Niles Gilbert. I didn't know what was gonna happen to Ramon. I really didn't. Then you weren't using your head. I couldn't stop it. ** I understand. I've been there, too. Hi. What a nice surprise. How long you staying? Were y'all at a party? Honey, what's wrong? ** So, that's it? He gets off scot What did you want me to do? I don't know -- something. Make him go to church and do charitable works -- some kind of penance. You don't agree? Sal, he's in agony -- I promise you. Good. He should be. Don't look at me like that. He's surrounded by men who think there's glory in violence. It's teaching him the wrong things. ** Phineas: That's a gift for your daddy. I was thinking for his 40th, but I haven't decided. He can't even look at me. If that's the case, it's only because he's seeing himself. What does that mean? After Everett and your grandma died, the Colonel kept your daddy and me close. Just took us along for everything he did. And we had a few real bad years with cattle thieves. And the, uh, Colonel took it real personal. Decided to rid the county of all of its bad apples. And, of course, we were there -- at his side. When we caught someone, we strung a noose around their neck, sat 'em on a horse. Your daddy and I would slap the horse on its backside. ** The guy would drop. Just hang there. I remember this one time, tree limb broke... and the rustler just got dragged by his neck through the brush. Your daddy ended up shooting the fella. He was 12 by then. I think something's changed in you, Pete. And it's something you don't understand. And you won't let me near enough to understand it, either. ** We can't live like this. I know. Look me in the eye, at least. Sal. It's fine. I'm fine. I never wanted any of this to happen. I thought everything bad I went through when we were kids, all of it was gonna stop with me. I was -- I was gonna be the end of the line. I know it's killing you. But there's nothing I can do, is there? You're so sad that nobody can reach you. Are you happy here -- in the city? Yeah. Then you and the kids should stay. You know... when we got married, I thought that we would live here in Austin. We were 18. I didn't know you. Jonas: Daddy? ** Where you going? Ranch. You all right to drive? Yeah, I'm fine. Why don't you spend the night? Leave in the morning. I'd rather leave when it's cool, clear my head a bit. Mm. I'll go with you, then. No. They need you here. Daddy? ** Hello? Inez: Mr. Pete? Are you all right? Go home, Inez. Tell the staff they got the day off. I wanna be alone. I'll see you tomorrow. Sí, señor. No. I'll fight you right now, you piece of shit. Damn. Look at 'em all. ** Hi. Hi. Did I wake you? No. Sorry. Uh, come in. What's going on? I came to say goodbye. Goodbye? My husband didn't die. Uh... It's a lie I told everyone. Just -- But I don't want to lie to you. You're not a widow. My mother thinks I'm doomed -- that I don't have a future. I don't know. She's probably right. No. That's... ** * She's only a bird in a gilded cage * * A beautiful sight to see * And her beauty was sold * For an old man's gold * She's a bird in a gilded cage *
