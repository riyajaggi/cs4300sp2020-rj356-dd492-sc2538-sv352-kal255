[Roy]: The poor kids' just had to take on more than he can manage. Well I can't leave him behind [Roy]: Skull leader to control [Roy]: Lisa, I'm going back to pick up something I left down on the island [Roy]: Captain Kramer will take command of the fighter group until I return, over [Lisa]: Why are you returning? Over [Roy]: Rick Hunter in fighter VT-102 is still back on the island and I have to go pick him up now [Lisa]: That pilot is an imposter! I've gone through the enitre registry and I find no record of such a person! [Roy]: Well that's easy enough to explain. He's a civilian so he isn't listed in the military registry [Lisa]: What?!? A civilian! But I thought! Uh! Oh! [Sammie]: Huh?! [Kim]: Civilian?! [Sammie]: Who is he?

 [Rick Moans] [Rick]: Huh? Thank heavens she's alive [Rick]: Uhhh. Uh oh! [Rick]: The alien! [Rick]: I gotta go! She might panic if she sees that [Rick]: Hope this thing will still fly [Rick whimpers in Fear] [Minmei]: Oh, what happened? [Rick whimpers in Fear] [Minmei]: What's wrong? Why you trembling like that? [Minmei]: Haan? What are you looking at out there? [Minmei]: What's there... [Rick]: No! You musn't look out there! [Minmei]: Why?! What is it?! What's wrong?! [Rick]: Oh my gosh! [Minmei]: What is it?! [Rick]: Oh! [Roy]: I hate to interrupt you two but you can't sit around here forever. Come on let's go [Roy]: Huh? Ha ha ha [Roy]: That big paluga seems to have formed a permanent attachment to you guys [Rick]: No! Shhhh! [Minmei]: ohh [Rick]: Amazing isn't it! [Rick]: Boy... [Minmei]: It's really incredible [Roy]: How's that for convenience [Roy]: Hang on you two! [Rick and Minmei shout in fear] [Lisa]: This is SDF-1 shifting to horizontal propulsion [Lisa]: Standby for firing gun. All planes return to carrier bays, over [Flight Group]: This is CBR-3. Roger control. Returning to carrier bay [Captain Gloval]: Lisa! See if all the fighters are safely aboard the ship now [Lisa]: Yes, Sir [Lisa]: That's the last two, Sir. All fighters are accounted for except Commander Fokker and VT-102 [Captain Gloval]: Good! I don't think we have to worry about Commander Fokker [Captain Gloval]: Vanessa, show me the positions of Armor 01 and Armor 10 on the monitor screen [Vanessa]: Yes Sir. They're both approaching rendezvous point now [Vanessa]: We should be making contact with them in about half an hour. [Captain Gloval]: Very good [Captain Gloval]: Any sign of enemy craft, Claudia? [Claudia]: No Captain, its all clear [Lisa]: Excuse me Captain, but isn't that strange? [Captain Gloval]: What? [Lisa]: After launching such a massive attack from orbit. Why isn't the enemy continuing their attack? It just doesn't make sense does it? [Captain Gloval]: That's bothering me too [Captain Gloval]: There has to be a reason they're just playing with us [Lisa & Claudia]: oh! [Lisa]: Do you really think they're just playing with us, Captain? [Captain Gloval]: Yes [Captain Gloval]: They have the advantage but they don't attack [Captain Gloval]: They must have a reason [Lisa & Claudia]: Huh! [Rick]: She doesn't want to go to the ship Roy. She wants to go back to Macross Island [Roy]: Are you crazy?!? [Roy]: The place is crawling with aliens! It would be suicide for her to go back there! [Roy]: Did she give any reason for wanting to go back? [Rick]: Well... [Minmei]: Well, I'm worried about my aunt and uncle back in the shelter with the invaders all around them [Roy]: They're perfectly safe there [Roy]: The shelters are impregnable [Minmei]: But I still want to go back to the Island. It's my home! [Roy]: I promise! As soon as the war is over I'll take you back there personally [Minmei]: Ohhhh [Rick]: What do you mean you'll take her back?!? I will! [Minmei]: Huh? [Rick]: Huh? oh! [Roy]: Hold on a minute, Rick. This is skull leader calling SDF-1, over [Lisa]: Did you find him? [Roy]: He was annoying a young lady. I had to rescue her as well [Rick]: You rat! [Lisa]: So that's our civilian pilot! I wondered why he didn't know how to fly his plane [Lisa]: So that's our civilian pilot! I wondered why he didn't know how to fly his plane [Rick]: Who's that old sour puss, Roy? [Lisa]: Old Sour Puss!! [Roy]: Aha ha. That old sour puss is our control operator Lisa Hayes [Roy]: And if she looks like an old sour puss to you, you're not as grown up as I thought you were Rick [Roy Laughs] [Lisa]: Now listen Commander Fokker! You'd better have a good explanation for turning a Veratech fighter over to an amatuer civilian pilot! [Captain Gloval]: He he he, ahem! [Lisa]: You could be court-martialed for this you know! [Roy]: Oooh! She's mad [Lisa]: As for you Rick Hunter. You're in a lot of trouble whether you know it or not! [Rick]: This whole thing is her fault [Minmei]: I think I'd apologise to her if I were you, Rick. Women her age can get awfully mean you know [Roy]: Bridge control, this is skull leader requesting landing instructions. Give us a bay number. You old sour puss [Bridge crew laughs] [Lisa]: Ahhhh! [Bridge crew laughs] [Lisa]: Roger! Bring your plane into bay 504! [Lisa]: Ehh! Ahem! [Breetai's Crew]: Recon force now returning to report with you [Exedore]: It appears only half of them came back! [Breetai]: Where is the battle fortress now? [Breetai's Crew]: It's passing through the atmospheric ranges presently. Apparantly it's on it's way to rendezvous with the other ships [Exedore]: What's your plan Breetai? [Breetai]: We could shoot them down now but I don't want that ship damaged [Exedore]: Once they're out of gravity they can execute a hyperspace fold taking them beyond the range of our guns [Breetai]: You have a point there, Exedore. Perhaps I could apply a little restraint in force in order to slow them down a bit [Breetai]: Prepare a laser bombardment! [Breetai's Crew]: Ready all guns! Massive laser bombardment [Breetai's Crew]: Repeat, all gunnery crews ready your lasers for total bombardment of target area [Breetai's Crew]: Standby for order to fire [Roy]: I got a little surprise for you, Rick. Wait till you see it! He he [Roy]: Huh! [Rick and Minmei shout in shock] [Rick and Minmei]: Oh! [Roy]: Here we are [Roy]: Come on! [Rick]: Was that really necessary, Roy? She could've been hurt [Minmei]: Golly Rick! Look at that! [Roy]: Somebody left this thing behind so I stashed it here [Rick]: Oh! [Rick]: Wow! [Rick]: My racer! I thought I'd never see it again! [Rick]: You saved it! Oh! Thank you, Roy! Thank you! Thank you! Thank... [Roy]: Hey cut it out, Rick! [Rick]: ...you! Oh! [Roy]: Take it easy [Roy]: I just thought you'd feel more comfortable flying in this than one of our Veratechs [Roy]: It doesn't turn into a battloid [Rick]: Oh golly, Roy! [Minmei]: I've seen... [Rick]: Huh? [Minmei]: ...that plane before [Minmei]: It was in the air show this morning wasn't it? [Claudia]: Attention all hands. We are approaching rendezvous with Armor 01 and 10 [Claudia]: Report to your docking stations immediately! All hands report to your stations! [Roy]: I have to get going now. Ah! [Roy]: You two stay here and don't wander around. If you start exploring you'll get lost! [Roy]: You can't imagine how enormous this ship is so stay put! [Vanessa]: We have perfect docking alignment [Breetai's Crew]: The enemy ships are docking, Sir [Breetai]: Alright! Tell your gunners to fire the beams between the ships [Breetai]: I don't care how many of the smaller ones are destroyed but the large one must not be damaged! [Breetai's Crew]: Yes Commander! Attention all gunnery crews. We will commence massive barrage [Breetai's Crew]: Take particular care not to damage the battlefortress! Gun commanders may fire when ready [SDF-1 Bridge Crew Screams] [SDF-1 Bridge Crew Screams] [Captain Gloval]: Brace yourselves! [Captain Gloval]: Vanessa! What's their position! [Vanessa]: The current attack is from the exact same location as the first one, Captain Gloval. Their orbit is 10,000 miles from here [Lisa]: Reporting! Miranda Sersey and Armor 03 were destroyed. [Captain Gloval]: They're tearing our fleet to shreds! What about our damages? [Sammie]: We've taken no direct hits, Captain. [Kim]: No damage shown anywhere, Sir [Captain Gloval]: What is our position? [Vanessa]: Ummmm [Vanessa]: We're just closing our initial orbit approaching our original position over Macross Island at an altitude of 100 miles [Captain Gloval]: Claudia, steer for a landing on Macross Island. [Captain Gloval]: At 2,000 feet altitude activate the fold system for a position jump [Claudia]: Are you sure you want to do that, Captain? The fold system hasn't even been tested yet! [Captain... ...Gloval]: I realise how risky it is, Claudia but if we stay in this position we'll be totally defenseless! [Captain Gloval]: Eh? [Lisa]: But we're not even sure how the system works! [Captain Gloval]: We can't just surrender, Lisa! We have to try everything first! [Captain Gloval]: Ready the fold system for a position jump targeting the area behind the moon [Captain Gloval]: Get your radar busy on an access check, Lisa. We'll make the jump from precisely 2000 feet above the island [Claudia]: Huh? Don't we need permission from headquarters? [Captain Gloval]: This is an emergency. We don't have time for that [Claudia]: But Captain! You know the regulation specifically...Uhh, sorry, Sir [Captain Gloval]: I know what the regulations say but I appreciate you bringing it to my attention [Claudia]: I just wanted to... [Captain Gloval]: Claudia! You've got my order! [Claudia]: Yes, Sir! Captain! [Claudia]: Attention all hands! Priority! Fold system standby. Readying maximum green energy at all power stations [Shipwide Announcement]: All hands to emergency positions! Repeat, all hands to emergency positions. This is not a drill! Prepare for fold in T minus 5 minutes and counting! Mark [Jason]: I'm getting worried about Minmei arn't you? I wonder where she went [Jason's Father]: She Just went... ...to another shelter that's all [Uncle]: Nothing's going to happen to anyone as smart as Minmei, Isn't that right [Jason]: Yeeaahhh [Minmei]: Are you planning on going somewhere? [Rick]: I'm going to take you back to the Island like I promised [Rick]: You still want to go don't you? Because I'm not going to hang around here one way or the other. [Minmei]: Hold it? [Rick]: Thanks [Shipwide Announcement]: Attention all hands! Fold T-3 Minutes and counting [Shipwide Announcement]: Attention all hands! Fold T-3 Minutes and counting [Minmei]: What's a fold? [Rick]: Oh nothing to do with us. Come on lets go. [Minmei]: It's so small. Will it hold two people? [Rick]: If they're very friendly it will [Rick and Minmei Grunt] [Rick]: Here put this on [Minmei]: Oh! [Minmei]: Unhh! Unhh! Wow! Uhun [Minmei]: Unhh! Unhh! Wow! Uhun [Rick]: It's so cute on you Minmei you could start a whole new fashion! [Rick Laughs] [Minmei]: Oh you! [Minmei]: Ohhh! [Rick and Minmei Grunt] [Rick]: Ok! Hang on to me [Minmei]: It's awful close [Rick]: Hey! I can't see to fly if you sit there! [Rick]: Hey! I can't see to fly if you sit there! [Minmei]: I'm sorry Rick but it's so tight! [Rick and Minmei]: Whoa! [Rick]: There's nothing to be afraid of Minmei! I'm an expert pilot [Rick]: There now! Ok [Minmei]: Oh! [Minmei Giggles] [Shipwide Announcement]: We will enter fold in 10 Seconds [Claudia]: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 [Captain Gloval]: Execute hyperspace fold jump! [Alarms Blaring] [Breetai]: A fold! I don't believe it! [Exedore]: Impossible at that altitude! [Breetai]: It may be impossible but they did it! [Exedore]: What'll we do now Commander? [Breetai]: Uuuuunnnggghh! [Breetai]: I want to be informed of their exact location immediately! [Breetai's Crew]: Now, Sir? [Breetai]: Now! [Minmei & Rick]: Huh?!? Ohhhh! [Captain Gloval]: Let's have some light in here [Claudia]: Switching to backup generators, Sir [Vanessa]: Radar shows an extremely large object just beneath us, Sir. [Captain Gloval]: Our jump target was the moon, that's what your large object is [Vanessa]: No, its too small to be the moon, Sir. I'll put it on the monitor screen for you [Vanessa & Captain Gloval Exclaim in Surprise] [Vanessa]: It's coming at us! [Captain Gloval]: No, we're moving towards it! [Vanessa & Captain Gloval Exclaim in Surprise] [Kim]: It's Macross Island, Captain Gloval! [Captain Gloval]: Enter rockets, Claudia! Maximum thrust! [Claudia]: It's no go! I'm getting no response whatever from the computer! [Lisa Shipwide]: Emergency! Emergency! Prepare for impact! Prepare for impact! [Sammie]: It's covered with ice, Captain! [Civilian]: Hey we're floating! [Civilans Shout in Panic] [Rick]: Oh wow! [Minmei]: Ohhhh! [Minmei]: Look how beautiful it is! [Minmei]: Whoa! [Rick]: (I'm getting no response at all from the fan jet) [Rick]: (Somehow we seem to have drifted out into deep space. And that means we're in deep trouble) [Minmei]: Oh my! Isn't it romantic? [Rick]: Yes it is [Rick & Minmei Shout in Fear] [Minmei]: Whoa! [Rick Sneezes and Laughs with Minmei] [Minmei]: Oh! What's that hissing sound? [Rick]: Oh its perfectly alright. Don't get upset about it [Rick]: Oh its perfectly alright. Don't get upset about it [Rick Laughs] [Rick]: We hear all kinds of weird noises in these things [Rick]: We hear all kinds of weird noises in these things [Rick Laughs] [Rick]: Huh [Rick]: (I don't dare tell her it's our oxygen is leaking out. Maybe this'll hold it temporarily) [Minmei]: Let's get out of here ok. [Rick]: Hey! What's your hurry? Just relax and enjoy the view [Rick]: (If the boosters don't work we're sunk!) [Minmei Grunts] [Rick]: Comfy? [Minmei]: Ahan [Rick]: We better try to find the battle fortress. Something funny's been going on around here! [Minmei]: There it is! Looks like they're still fighting down there [Rick]: Don't worry [Minmei Shouts in Fear] [Rick]: I forgot they closed the landing bays during combat. [Minmei]: Hunh! [Rick & Minmei Shout in Fear] [Rick]: Maybe... [Rick]: Maybe... [Rick]: Maybe we can go through the whole he made [Minmei & Rick Grunt] [Rick & Minmei Laugh] [Sammie]: We just shot down the last enemy battlepod, Sir [Captain Gloval]: Very good! [Kim]: The civilian refugees from the shelters are being brought on board now, Sir [Kim]: The civilian refugees from the shelters are being brought on board now, Sir. [Kim]: And the medics report they are in good shape [Kim]: And the medics report they are in good shape [Captain Gloval]: Thank you, Kim [Captain Gloval]: Any contact with Headquarters yet? [Claudia]: No Captain, I've tried but I haven't been able to raise them [Sammie]: Are you sure there's no system malfunction? [Sammie]: Are you sure there's no system malfunction? [Claudia]: Negative! [Vanessa]: None at all. It's operating perfectly [Captain Gloval]: Give me the reading on our position [Captain Gloval]: Give me the reading on our position. [Vanessa]: The planet pluto's orbit according to the computer plot [Vanessa]: The planet pluto's orbit according to the computer plot. [Captain Gloval]: The planet Pluto! [Lisa]: Is that possible?!? [Claudia]: It can't be! [Claudia]: It can't be! [Claudia]: I was against this fold system all along! [Claudia]: I was against this fold system all along! [Lisa Gasps in Surprise] [Claudia]: I was against this fold system all along! [Lisa]: Captain! [Kim]: Ohh! [Sammie]: What can we do?! [Sammie]: What can we do?! [Captain Gloval]: Now, now, now. Settle down. Don't panic. [Captain Gloval]: Now, now, now. Settle down. Don't panic. All we have to do is re-fold to get right back where we started [Captain Gloval]: There's absolutely nothing to worry about [Lisa]: I hope not, Captain [Lisa]: I hope not, Captain [Bridge Intercom Rings] [Captain Gloval]: Now What! [Lisa]: Who is it! [Captain Gloval]: Yes [Captain Gloval]: Hmmm [Captain Gloval]: What!?! [Captain Gloval]: It can't be! [Captain Gloval]: Impossible! [Captain Gloval]: I'll be right there!
