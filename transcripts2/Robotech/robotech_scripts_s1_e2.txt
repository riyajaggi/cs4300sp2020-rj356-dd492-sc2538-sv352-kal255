 [Narrator]: And then it underwent a startling transformation [Narrator]: As young Rick ponders what to do next, the Zentradi invaders draw ever closer [Narrator]: And aboard the reconstructed battle fortress [Narrator]: Captain Gloval and his inexperienced crew prepare to confront the vastly superior forces of the alien enemy [Vanessa]: 24 unidentified objects are decending just offshore, Sir [Captain Gloval]: oh! And why didn't we detect them before now? [Vanessa]: When the main guns automatically fired at the first attack it sapped so much power our radar was knocked out [Captain Gloval]: The scout ships were just a decoy. Very clever strategy [Captain Gloval]: Lisa! Call Lt. Cmdr. Fokker's team back here immediately! [Lisa]: They're still combating the first attack wave, Sir [Lisa]: I doubt if they can break away! [Captain Gloval]: I understand [Captain Gloval]: Thank you [Vanessa]: The unidentified craft have landed in the water  25 miles west of us and they seem to have submerged, Sir

 [Captain Gloval]: Call Prometheus and order them to send out Reconnaissance choppers [Lisa]: I did, Sir. They'll arrive in 5 minutes [Captain Gloval]: Mind Reader! [Lisa]: uh... [Lisa]: Yes Sir [Survivors]: What is that? A giant robot. Could be an alien invader! [Minmei]: Whatever it is it's stopped moving. It's just standing there now [Jason]: Wow! [Jason]: Hey Minmei! Come see what's out here an honest to goodness giant robot! [Minmei]: Jason be careful! [Minmei]: Oh Jason! What if that thing had stepped on you! [Jason]: Oh I can take care of myself [Jason]: I wanna get a good look at that thing. Come on! We'll go upstairs and look out the window [Minmei]: ooohhhh! Jason wait for me! [Auntie]: Oh! Don't let him fall out the window you hear! [Minmei]: Don't worry Auntie, I'll watch him [Chopper Pilot]: This is PHP-202 approaching target area and no sign of alien craft so far, over [Lisa]: Roger PHP-202. Approach with caution [Lisa]: Craft suspected to be submerged in the ocean [Chopper Pilot]: We're being fired upon! Let's get outa here! Ahhh! [Lisa]: They're gone, Sir. They've been shot down [Captain Gloval]: Hmmmmm, and here I am. A helpless captain of an untested ship, with an inexperienced crew [Senator]: Well Captain! It's lucky for us that we got this ship ready in time to fight off the invaders [Senator]: When do you take off? [Captain Gloval]: Hmmph! [Senator]: You are ready arn't you? [Senator]: Why haven't you taken off? What are you waiting for? [Captain Gloval]: You must think I'm out of my mind! [Captain Gloval]: I can't take this ship into combat with a crew of raw recruits who've never flown in space before! [Captain Gloval]: What's more, this ship hasn't even been tested yet and with all due respect, Sir, we don't even know if it'll fly [Sammie]: Hey Kim, do you think he means it? [Captain Gloval]: If you order me to take it up I'll  obey but it'll be against my better judgement. [Senator]: I am ordering you to takeoff Captain, Understand! [Captain Gloval]: It won't be my responsibility then because I tell you it's suicide! [Kim]: I think he means it [Sammie]: Oh wow! [Kim]: What's wrong Sammie? I thought you wanted to go into space [Sammie]: I do [Sammie]: I think [Captain Gloval]: This is an alien ship [Captain Gloval]: While we were able to reconstruct it [Captain Gloval]: We don't understand how to operate even half of it's functions yet! [Senator]: It sounds to me as though you're saying you have no confidence in your crew [Senator]: Is that what you're telling me Captain? [Captain Gloval]: I didn't say that! [Senator]: Well then what is the problem? [Senator]: We spent a fortune on this Robotech ship and I don't want to see it destroyed on the ground! [Captain Gloval]: Senator... [Senator]: No Captain [Senator]: No more excuses. Takeoff! [Captain Gloval]: Well [Captain Gloval]: If that's your order [Senator]: That's right Captain, it is [Senator]: SDF-1 is a battleship [Senator]: That's what it was built for [Senator]: Well girls, we're all depending on you, so [Senator]: Don't let us down [Captain Gloval]: (We arn't ready for combat. We just arn't ready!) [Jason]: Wow! [Jason]: Look how big it is! [Minmei]: Be careful Jason! [Jason]: I wonder where it came from [Crowd]: Look! It's head! What is it anyway! It just fell out of the sky and crashed into several bulidings! It's as big as a building itself! [Jason]: Look! It's back opened up! [Jason]: There's nobody riding it! [Minmei]: Hmmn [Jason]: Hey! Wait! There he is! [Rick]: Huh! [Crowd]: Wha... [Rick]: What's going on here? Where am I? [Jason]: The pilot looks confused [Minmei]: Maybe he was injured in the crash [Rick]: I must be seeing things! This used to be a fighter plane! [Rick]: Excuse me. What is this? [Rick]: I mean... What does it look like to you? [Minmei]: Huh? [Rick]: What is it? [Minmei]: Some kind of robot, I think [Rick]: Oh great! [Rick]: Wow. When I got into this thing it was an aircraft. I thought I'd gone nuts [Jason]: you mean its... [Jason & Minmei]: a convertible airplane? [Minmei]: You must be joking! [Jason]: Huh? [Rick]: I'm as puzzled as anybody about it [Minmei]: You're kidding! You're the pilot and you don't even know what it is? [Rick]: No, I'm not a military pilot. I'm just an amatuer. [Minmei]: What!?! [Minmei]: How'd you get that robot?! [Rick]: It's all a big mistake [Rick]: I'm not supposed to have it [Jason]: An enemy spy! [Minmei]: Jason! [Rick]: Spy? [Rick]: Look this was the army's idea not mine! [Rick]: Wow. Look at all the damage [Minmei]: You don't have to pay for it [Rick]: Me? I hope not [Rick]: What?!? [Truck Driver]: Get that thing off the road! [Truck Driver]: I've a truckload of vital military supplies to deliver and I'm in a hurry! Now move it! [Rick]: I don't know how it works but I'll try [Minmei]: Good luck! [Rick]: Thanks [Minmei]: And please be careful [Rick]: Sure [Rick]: I will [Rick]: So long [Minmei]: I hope I see you again some time [Rick]: Well. All I can do is throw a few switches and hope for the best I guess [Rick]: At least I can see where I'm going [Rick]: If I could just figure out how to get there [Crowd Screams] [Rick]: Woah! [Jason & Minmei]: Ohhh! Run! [Minmei]: Oh please tell me you're ok, Jason [Jason]: I am [Rick]: Are you two ok in there? [Jason]: Huh! [Minmei]: We're ok [Rick]: Phew! [Rick]: Thank Goodness! [Sammie]: Gravity control systems 1 through 48 are green light. [Sammie]: Please confirm over. [Crew]: Roger, green light [Sammie]: I am now switching from manual to computer control.

[Sammie]: Aye aye, Sir, full thrust [Kim]: Anti-gravity full thrust [Claudia]: Reflex furnace now activiated at full thrust and reduction control board countdown is underway [Countdown]: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 [Claudia]: 4, 3, 2, 1 [Captain Gloval]: Full Power! [Captain Gloval]: Activate the anti-gravity control system! [Lisa]: The gyroscope is level, Sir [Captain Gloval]: Well done [Bridge Crew Screams] [Captain Gloval]: What is this going on?!? (I don't know!) [Captain Gloval]: Turn the pitch attitude immediately! [Claudia]: It must be the gyroscope! [Lisa]: No look! The gravity pods are breaking away! [Captain Gloval]: What is it?!? Oh no! [Captain Gloval]: They're tearing away from the ship instead of lifting it! [Captain Gloval]: This can't be happening. Ohh... [Lisa]: The ship is losing altitude, Captain! [Captain Gloval]: Please. Tell me I'm dreaming this!  [Lisa]: Pardon, Sir? [Captain Gloval]: It's a nightmare! [Bridge Crew Screams] [Captain Gloval]: Is everybody ok? [Bridge Crew]: Aye Aye, Sir, We're ok [Captain Gloval]: I want a full damage report. Give me a computer readout on every system onboard [Kim & Sammie]: Yes Sir!

We met the enemy air assault and  we sent them back where they came from [Lisa]: Very commendable work Commander Fokker I'll uhh.... [Claudia]: Let me talk to him. How many did you shoot down? [Roy]: Only 10 this time [Claudia]: You're slipping Roy. [Roy]: Well don't worry Claudia I'll make it up [Roy]: Do you have any word on the VT-102? [Lisa]: He landed in Macross City in a battloid and he's doing more damage than the enemy! [Roy]: Haha, thanks Lisa [Lisa]: Who is he? He's not registered as a fighter pilot [Roy]: It's ok I know him [Lisa]: He needs help [Roy]: I better go check on him [Roy]: Skull leader to group. You guys head on back to Prometheus. I got some business to take care of in town [Roy]: Captain Kramer, you take care of group command, over [Captain Kramer]: Roger, Commander [Roy]: I should've known better than to leave him alone [Roy]: Aha! [Roy]: There's the battloid [Roy]: This is skull leader calling VT-102 do you read me, over [Rick]: Hi Roy, it's me! [Roy]: Had a busy day down there I see [Rick]: Yeah, you might say that big brother [Civilians]: Now what! [Civilians Shout in Fear] [Rick]: I must be dreaming this! I don't believe it! [Jason]: That airplane became a robot too! [Minmei]: Amazing! [Roy]: A few small repairs and you can take that battloid back into action [Rick]: What're you talking about! [Rick]: I don't even know what this thing is! And I'm sure not qualified to operate it! [Roy]: If you can fly a jet you can operate a battloid [Roy]: The controls arn't that much different. I'll tell you what to do [Roy]: The legs are controlled by the foot pedals [Rick]: Huh? Which foot pedals? There must be 50 different controls in here! [Roy]: 57 to be exact. I'll explain them to you while I'm making the repairs. [Roy]: The battloids are classified TOP SECRET. And trust me there is a reason for them [Roy]: There, that ought to do it! [Roy]: Switch on low energy and press the foot pedals slowly. [Rick]: Ok. Here goes [Roy]: That's it. See how easy it is [Rick]: Phew! [Minmei]: Wow! You learn fast don't you! [Rick]: Thanks! [Auntie]: Minmei! Come on! [Minmei]: Ok Auntie. See you later we're being evacuated [Breetai's Crew]: The recon and battle pods have landed, Commander. We're ready to attack [Breetai]: Attention all gunnery crews! Prepare to give covering fire to the recon assault group! [Breetai's Crew]: Ready all guns. Ready all guns. Set for long range covering fire [Roy]: We better get moving Rick. We still have a war to fight [Rick]: I'm still pretty unsure of myself trying to keep  track of all these robot controls. I'm not ready for combat [Roy]: Pull the control marked 'G' and we'll switch to Guardian configuration [Rick]: What the heck is a guardian? [Rick]: Here goes! [Roy]: The guardian controls operate almost exactly like the fighter plane. You can fly it without any problems [Minmei]: Oh no! I have to go back for my diary. Somebody might find it and read it! [Auntie]: Don't be foolish child! You can't go back now! [Minmei]: It'll only take me a minute to get it. Don't worry [Auntie]: No Minmei! You don't have time! Come Back! [Breetai's Crew]: All guns standing by for bombardment Commander Breetai [Breetai]: Good! Level everything in the path of the assault forces but be careful not to damage that battle fortress. I want to take it intact! [Civilians Scream] [Rick]: They're invading the city! [Roy]: Yeah, it looks like the civilians got out just in time [Rick]: Wow! The whole place is under attack! I hope everybody got out ok! [Roy]: If you're worried about your girlfriend we might check on her [Rick]: Could we? [Captain Gloval]: Do we have a fix on where that bombardment is coming from? [Kim]: A fleet of spaceships in lunar orbit [Captain Gloval]: Beyond the range of our missiles [Lisa]: Captain! An alien assault force is approaching from the East! [Lisa]: We need air support, Sir! [Captain Gloval]: Call for it [Lisa]: This is SDF-1. We are under attack and need immediate support. Assume guardian configuration [Captain Kramer]: Roger SDF-1 coming in  [Captain Kramer]: All veratechs switch to guardian mode [Minmei Shouts] [Roy]: Oh no you don't! [Minmei Whimpers] [Roy]: Take it easy honey. You're ok. We'll protect you [Roy]: Take care of the girl, Rick, I'll hold them off! [Rick]: You can't handle them alone! [Roy]: Don't argue with me! I'll draw their fire while you get her out of here! [Rick]: Stay right there! I'll pick you up [Minmei]: I thought you were an amatuer! Huh! Oh no! [Rick]: Trust me I can do it! [Minmei]: Do I have to? Oh! [Roy]: Get out of here, Rick! Fire your jets! [Minmei]: Whoa! [Minmei]: Uhhh! Oh! Ahh! Uhhh! Oh! Ahh! [Minmei]: What? What are you saying? I can't hear you [Roy]: How's it going? Everything ok? [Rick]: I'll be ok, Roy [Roy]: I don't care how you are [Rick]: Huh? [Roy]: How's the girl? [Rick]: The girl?

[Rick]: What was it!?! What was that thing, Roy!?! [Rick Whimpers in Fear] [Roy]: That is the enemy. Now you know why we built the battloids, Rick. To fight these giant aliens [Rick]: They look just like human beings! [Roy]: Yeah, if you ever saw a human 50 feet tall [Roy]: I guess you understand now, why we kept this a secret [Claudia]: Engineering reports backup rockets are fueled and ready for firing [Claudia]: How's the evacuation progressing, Lisa? [Lisa]: All the civilians have been safely transported to shelters. The city is deserted. [Captain Gloval]: Very well [Captain Gloval]: Switch on the main booster rockets. We'll be blasting off immediately [Lisa]: I hope the standby boosters work! [Captain Gloval]: They'll work Lisa. They were made on Earth [Captain Gloval]: Alright? [Captain Gloval]: Blast Off!
