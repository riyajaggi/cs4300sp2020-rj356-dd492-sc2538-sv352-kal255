 Michael Sharp. He just cleared Customs at Stansted an hour ago. The building Sharp went into is a safety deposit house. Picked him up on their cam heading into Bank Station. And then vanished. Well, this isn"t good. The fourth man. Called himself Ray. He had that er... skin disease when... when skin bleaches. Michael Sharp, I"m arresting you on suspicion of armed robbery. Huh? Listen. Look, there"s three of us in this marriage, all right?

 You can"t just expect me to leave my wife and come and see you. We"re supposed to be adults. If you"ve got something to say, you can say it over the phone. Hello? Hello? Oh, come on. Don"t go all silent on me. I"m not going silent on you. I"m just concentrating. I"m actually looking for Sharp clues in the BMW. Well, mate, listen. You sounded silent to me. Anyway, look, I gotta go. Arjana"s gonna be wondering where I am. All right? See you later. It"s the last one, Pike. Any more and they"ll notice.

 Well, who are they gonna tell? Police? Why so serious? To become partner, I need that. Or bring in meaningful clients to show I"m worth my partnership. Ta rass! I thought this was about making money, - not giving it to them. - It is, eventually, but this is what they call a buy-in. It"s what I call a fucking liberty. Mm. Maybe I"m better off as a mother to my two crazy kids. - Three now. - Oh. But don"t worry. I"ll sell Bishop down the docks. Great. That"s a fiver right there. I"m serious, Ronnie. Where are we gonna find that sort of money? Baby... when have you ever not got what you wanted? - I"ve got you. - Yeah. So, what do you say? Come here. - Mm... - Ow! What is that? Don"t be making like you ain"t felt Big Ronnie before. This fucking laptop"s digging at my side. - You ready? - Jump on. Kev. I need the dashboard cam of the BMW that"s down in the garage. The very one that you smashed to pieces? The very one that Pike smashed to pieces? Yes. Denied? I don"t like that at all. - Why you gotta drive so mad? - Shut up. What do you think "access denied" means? It means we"re no longer on the case. Cos our car got smashed? You forgot your suspect getting killed in that sentence. You"re just gonna take it, Tanner? Fucking "Ma"am" to you. And, please, spare me with your cheap jibes. You had Sharp in custody and now he"s dead. - Who"s that down to? - The mug who T-boned us. Don"t pull that one on me. Who wants to take responsibility for their actions? Who wants to admit they lost a valuable suspect while in their custody? Boys, you know I"ve got a soft spot for you, but sometimes you act like a pair of petulant little shits. We"re off the Sharp case due to negligence. Own it if you like. Robbery Squad have taken over cos it was a robbery that drew Sharp out. Now, I"m off to deal with some other fucking bottom-feeders because that"s what we do for a living. I"m not trying to be more paranoid than I usually am. But something"s not right. I can feel it. It makes no sense. - Bruv, we could"ve been killed. - So why weren"t we? I saw the arm that came through the window to kill Sharp and it had that polka-dot panda vitiligo shit. Barton was telling the truth. Barton"s the only remaining link to the robbery as well. Look, let"s just go to the prison, put it on him. I"m with you, but you have to get clearance from Tanner to see a Category A prisoner. We don"t get Tanner on side, we don"t get to see Barton. When she"s angry, there"s something about her - that"s cougarish I like. - Uh-uh, nuh. - Don"t go there. You're lonely. - Mm-mm. What the fuck did Sharp have to say that was so important? Do you know what? This stays low. No-one else knows, but we don"t stop. When do we ever? So we"ve got a name but no face. Jason Wood runs gangs manufacturing and serving Spice, Ketamine, meth amphetamine and marijuana. Wood does his business from a pub in Silvertown but never goes near the drugs. We don"t have a visual of him because he"s never been arrested. So, we"re hunting puff dealers? Don"t be boring. You're better than that. Just doing my job. Hold on. We"re getting dumped off the Sharp case to look for plants? We"re Organised Crime. "Not Gardeners" World. There"s a reason we"re off Sharp. - Involves a pair of clowns. - Shut your mouth! - Fuck off! - Oi. Easy. Tanner? You got a minute, please? Ah, always, sir. Ma"am, this is one of the NCA's Organised Crime command teams. You obviously know that reprobate. Very good. Keep up the good work. - Will do. - Shall we? Right. ID Wood and stick a bullet in his operation. Priority - find out where they make these drugs. And treat it like any other case. All of you. - How are you getting on? - How am I getting on? - This is a joke. Don"t know... - No. I meant you. Oh. Uh... Yeah, I"m all right. Thank you. Good. I thought Nell looked nice today. Like she... she made some extra effort for something. Shush your mouth. Please. Please. Or maybe someone. Bruv, just leave it! I don"t care how she looks. She can dress how she likes, you know. All right. I"m just saying, innit? She looked good. M... Maybe. Dunno. All right. Bruv, these kids look the same age as my Ali. - Yeah, man. - I mean, look at them, bro. Let"s go kick up these youths and end this. Yeah, man. Good idea, Officer Bishop. You saying we should put an end to this boring surveillance operation? Why you talking like that, man? Let"s just go down there. The sooner we end this, we can get back on Sharp. It"s a joke, innit? Just there"s a time and a place for voices. How come when I do it, it"s not funny, when you do, it"s funny? So what you saying? We just walk down there nicely and ask them to open the gate? Something like that. You know me. Yeah, I do know you. Stay there. Stay there! - Shit! - Fucking hell! Oi! - It"s police! Open the door! - Fuck off, you dirty piglets! Your mum taught you to speak like that? Open the gate! Got get a fucking warrant! Warrant, yeah? All right. Police, mate. - Gonna need your car. - What? No. What do you mean, no? Give me the keys, bro! - You don"t look like police! - Give him the damn keys! Thank you. Oi! Oh, shit. - Don"t make me run, bruv. Oi! - Jason! Call Jason! You can"t pull guns on a 15-year-old. I can"t? 15-year-olds shouldn"t deal drugs. It"s a very bad thing to do. Let this be a lesson to you. I"ll talk to you in a bit, all right? What? Through the fucking fence? I"ll be down in a minute. - Oh, sorry, mate. - Yeah, you want to be sorry. Fucking stop! Oi! Yo, man, fucking stop or I"ll put one in your fucking legs! - Fuck off! - Prick! Fucking come here! I"m telling you now, you"d better stop! Don"t you fucking try it, man! Get out of the car! Get out of the fucking car! Yeah? You miss me, you"ll hit the kid. I won"t give a fuck, but you might, you prick. Fucking wankers! Ohh... shit. Fuck. Yeah, no back-up, as usual. Look, I"m getting too old for this, man. The kid just laughed at me and jumped into a Bentley. At least we got one of them. What does Jason Wood look like? Like a drug dealer driving a Bentley, bro. - You jealous of the car, yeah? - Yeah, trust me, I am. All the more reason to bury him. Yeah. True. - This moves us forward, how? - Potential informant, ma"am. - And he can walk your dog. - Don"t mention my bloody dog. All right. It was a joke. The brief leaves and the social worker arrives. We beat him until he tells us the location of Wood"s drug factory. Simple. Can I file that in my report? Scarlett Nugent. Ryan Obora"s social worker. Who"s even letting you in? File what you want in your report, love. He has information that we need. Aren"t you a charmer? I"ve been told that. - I ain"t got time for this. - I know, fam. Is that your way to a kid"s heart? Beat them? He didn"t exactly get off to the best start. Methadone baby, 14-day detox. His father was doing a 12 and his mother rejected him. He grew up in Northpark care home... until he set fire to it. I got him fostered. Nice couple in Essex. The Fairlawns. And now he keeps running away. But they"ll always take him back - because that"s the way to a kid"s heart... love. Now... mind if I see him? By all means. Yo, you think she"ll give me her number or something? - No. But I like her, you know. - Yeah. Me too, bro. Was I right? Cheese and onion? Ryan, after you"ve had your drink, these men would like to speak to you about a man called Jason Wood. - I don"t know who that is. - What a load of rubbish. Go on, man. I"ve spoken to Mr and Mrs Fairlawn and they"re worried sick. All they want to do is give you a good home. Look, it"s best you cooperate with these men and tell them what you know about Wood, and then we can get you bailed. Ryan... - Do you want some more crisps? - Is this a joke? You talk to him like he"s five, he"ll keep acting up! - Are you stupid or what? - What are you doing? What are you doing? Think smart. Don"t be obvious, all right. Come on, man. You know what you need to do. Yeah? Gingernut, get up. Let"s go. Come on, on your feet. - Shut up! Come too if you want. - You can"t just... He can"t call him a gingernut, not in this day and age. Bruv, you drive like an old woman! I miss you, hound. All right, ma"am? Got any chocolate? You know what used to be over there? Northpark, innit. Do you know how I know that? No. I was on the second floor. Used to share a room with Michael Dooley and Delroy Neil. The smell of their feet used to drive me mad. Dooley hung himself because he couldn"t stop wetting the bed. Shame, because I actually liked him. Wanna know what happened to Delroy? Get in. Have a seat. Let me chat to her. Her? Just give me one minute with him. Fucking hell, bruv! Where the fuck are you going? You see that? That"s Delroy right there. Used to be a gangster and a dealer before he got hooked on a pipe himself. Last thing I heard, he was sucking dick for rocks. I bet he"s good at it after all these years of practice. You not doing that yet, no? School of hard knocks, kid. This is real life out here. Real talk. Bishop should be careful. He doesn"t care, but he could end up in front of a tribunal. Actually... he does care, ma"am. He just erm... just has a funny way of showing it. Oh, my God. - What? - You like him. - I"m just saying he cares. - It"s the way you said it. Be careful, cos uh... anything you say in this foot spa... could be used as evidence against you. He"s just a friend. OK? Tell the truth. Is that why you"re wearing lippy? I say fuck it, he"s back on the market. What the fuck is going on? Anyway, ma"am, I need a word. Yeah? - All right, Marvin? - Yes, ma"am. I need you to clear me to see Barton. - No. - Ma"am, I'm gonna slip in, find out if there"s anything he forgot to tell us, and slip out. - No further enquiries. - I said no! There"s a reason why we were taken off the Sharp case. And that"s not because we fucked up. I"m not stupid. Can you just help me find out why? Please. No. All right, do you know what? I"m gonna head down to the prison. If our relationship means anything to you at all - - yeah? - By the time I get down there, my name will be cleared to see Barton. If not... I know where we stand. Matthew and Lawna fostered me when I was ten years old. They used to take me to Cambersands on holiday. Should"ve seen me on the beach. Like a Malteser in a sea full of Milkybars. So I know how you feel, Ginger. You seen me. Yeah? - Cheers. Which way do I go? - Down the hallway to the right. Ta. You all right? Officer Pike. Here for a seg visit with 01132 Barton. Nothing here, pal. I think you need to check with your boss. I"ve an officer Pike to see 01132, Barton, Segregation. Just checking. Yeah, he"s clear. You"ve seen me play this trick before, but now it"s different. These are my girls. Ali, she"s 14. Donna, she"s six. Ali plays piano. She"s grade two. Political as well. Young radical. Now, you see, Donna... She"s a force of nature. Slightly deaf in one ear. Wears a hearing aid from time to time. I have to watch that. Kids bully for less. Why am I telling you all this? They nearly lost their father the other day. Someone you know. Ray. Vitiligo. Death stared me in the face... and I don"t want to see it again, all right? Come on, Barton... help me and I"ll help you. Give me any little thing you can. Any little crumb will do. I can get you cigarettes. I can get you books. Phone cards. Visits. I bet you"d like to see your wife. I can make that happen. The weapons we used on the work... get hired out all the time - hot tools. I know the supplier. Go on. Get me a visit with my wife and I"ll tell you. Hey, Bish. Do you still carry that gun? Yep. Let me see that, cuz? Come on, fam, let me see the fucking gun, man. Come on, Bish. Please. That"s how we roll, cuz. There"s no safety. Hammer stays down, first squeeze is a long one and then the weapon will discharge, got it? - You sound like a Fed, cuz! - You wanna shoot it or not? All right, man, sorry. All right... Listen... I never asked you to grass up Jason Wood. That"s not my style, man. But just know that when you leave me... I"m gonna follow you. So wherever you go... whoever you go visit next... just know that I"ll know. Hey. Two hands. Fuck! Being good takes practice. Give me it. Get in the car. Hmm? You"re a fucking legend... Don"t ever threaten me again. - Thanks, anyway. - Ever. And, Pike... no-one else can know. This was a favour for a friend. Especially not your father. OK. Don"t write it down, but remember this number, OK? 07700... 900... 880. - Yeah, man, I got that. - You locked it? Yeah, come on, man, I"ll call you, innit? Got more chance of seeing rocking horse shit but whatever. Yeah, but Mum would say don"t drive too fast, but there"s no chance of that. Homeward safe. You get the images I just sent you? Jason Wood? Yeah, but that"s only one of his aliases. Turns out he"s not just a drug dealer. He"s also been inside for attempted murder. One of his young dealers. Wood put 150 stitches in his face for stealing from his drug warehouse. - You still there? - Yeah. Where are you, anyway? I"m sitting outside his drug warehouse. I gotta go, babe. I"m seeing the old man. I"ve got a favour to ask him. OK, darling. Let me know how it goes. Love you. Ahh. Definitely 7pm somewhere in the world. Tell me. Eventful day, to say the least. Some kids selling drugs from the back garden. Had to smash a car through the fence to make an arrest. Picked up this IC-1, same age as Ali. Dunno if I"m getting older or these hoods are getting younger. Speaking of Ali, she"s got a piano recital coming up. She wanted to know if you and Charlotte would come. I really need to get her a new piano. She keeps saying, "My mates don"t practise on electronic keyboards." I said, "It worked for Stevie Wonder." She said, "Who?" I give up. You want money for Arjana"s partnership. That"s why you came here. It"s just until she brings in some clients. We"ll pay you back in a couple of months. We? Amazing how marital dynamics shift when the breadwinner changes from he to her. - I do all right. - And I"m proud of you. But you have opportunity here available to you that others not so fortunate will never have. Look, Dad, I came to ask you for a favour, not to get a lecture on my career. And I"m offering a favour. Only if I do what you want. My ability to navigate will cease in a few months when I retire. You have an opportunity to be standing in my very shoes, but you choose to play cops and robbers, which I respect, but everyone has the right to grow old gracefully. Especially those with privilege. That"s what I've got, yeah? Privilege? I can"t imagine your friend Bishop having this conversation. No, he would"ve fucking walked out by now. Ah, the language of the street. We always revert to what feels... comfortable... even if it"s not where we feel comfortable. Do you know what? I"m comfortable right where I am, even if it doesn"t suit your image. - Kelly Barton? - Who are you? I"m Adam Cole, a parole Liaison Officer. I"m here to arrange a visit with you and your husband. Come in. Yeah, come in. Thought you"d forgotten about us. My kids have been climbing the walls. He"s a good father, no matter what he"s supposed to have done. Can I go and see him straightaway... once you"ve cleared me? I need to ask you a couple of questions first, about your husband, just for my reference. Sure. Anything I can do to help, Mr Cole. It"s Adam. Anyway, erm... to your knowledge, has your husband ever been associated with a man called Michael Sharp? I"ve never heard him mention that name. What about a man called Ray? Ray who? I don"t have a surname. He has an identifying mark on his wrist. Are you familiar with vitiligo? Yeah. Michael Jackson had it. Oh, I can"t help you there. Sorry. OK. I think we"re done. Leave it with me, Kelly. We will get your visit processed straightaway. OK? - Thank you. - No problem. Give me some marshmallows! Just in time for supper, darling. Oh, bro, you melt me. Mm. Thank you, man. What"s going on? How did you get on with Barton? Yeah, said he"ll talk in exchange for a visit with his wife, which I"m sorting. - You"re sorting that, yeah? - You know me. Oh, right. How"d you get on with Jason Wood? - Got an address. - How was the kid? Ah, text-book little brat. Probably never hear from him again. What"s wrong, man? Why the long face? - It"s usually me asking that. - I know. But you know what, bruv? I got my swagger back. Glad to see one of us is on form, bro. You know what? I don"t know what I'd do without you, man. - Hey. - Hey. Quick threesome? I was talking about the wine. Bish, do you wanna do the honours? Give me the bottle. - Your wife wants me to pour it. - OK. She don"t trust your pouring, that"s why. You"re stingy with the pouring. - Thank you. - No worries. - OK? - Yeah. Just relax. Relax. Right. You know what? I"m gonna go to bed. Yeah. Let"s go. This is mine. Just grab my white stuff. - All right. - Yeah, good night. Hold on, I"m just gonna get my cake. - All right. Night. - Good night. See you later, bro. I detect slightly crumpled shoulders on my lion. Oh, I asked my dad about the buy-in. There"s too many strings attached, baby. Guy wants my soul. I don"t know why I didn't realise he"d be like that. It"s all right, Ron. I"m a happy woman. And I"m a happy man. And I"ve got an idea. - Oh, yeah? - Who can help. Bishop. Yo. - Hey, who"s this? - It"s Ginger. Ginger! What"s happening, man? No, nothing. Just a pocket call. OK, listen to me. Don"t go to Silvertown tomorrow morning, right? Yeah? Yeah. Just er... just stay home. For me. All right. Nice one, Bishop. See you. OK, cool. OK, on it. - Why does she slam the door? - I do not know. She"s been working on her legs, you know. Just an observation. Puts me to shame, really. £20 says left right. - Straight right. - Munroe? Left hook. Oh, yes. Thank you. Munroe, chains. Kamali, CCTV. Nell, weapon up. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Woo-hoo! Armed police! Get down on the floor! Don"t move! - Get down on the floor now! - Nobody move! Keep still. Munroe. - Put the weapon down. - Kam, cover him. Put the weapon down. Put the weapon down. Put the weapon down! Put it down! Jason Wood? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? One of you best start talking. Where is he? - Argh! - Kam! You OK? Yeah. Bish! Move, bro! Moving! Don"t move! Stay there, boy. Don"t move! I don"t want to shoot you, you know, but I will. Put the gun down. Put it down! Put it down! Shit! Aargh! Go to sleep, bruv. Go to sleep, bruv. Oh, yeah, you"re under arrest. Let it go. That"s a good girl. Good girl. - Boys! Found him! - Shut up, bitch, and walk. Jason Wood, you"re under arrest. You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Put those fucking guns down. Anything you do say may be given in evidence... Shut up, you... Oh. - You see? - Yeah, man. That"s the nutty thing. I weren"t scared at all. I just flew in there. Bang. Done "em." I mean, another one in the bag. That"s what I'm saying. I mean, what a team, eh? I mean, us three. Drop me out. That"s world class. I mean, I gotta tell yer, yeah? - I think the world of you both. - Shut up, man. He"s your boy. You deal with it. - I"m sorry, Bish. - Oh. These are my red Draggers. Gonna throw up on my shoes, yeah? Miss Carmel! Miss Carmel, can we have a word? I"ve just arrived, and I"m yet to speak to the team that conducted the raid, but I imagine it"s good news, don"t you? - Thank you. - Miss Carmel! - Miss Carmel? - Hello. Good afternoon. Is this due to your new strategy? Congratulations. Thank you. You not winded or anything? Little bit, but... it"ll be fine. I just want a burger. - You did what you had to do. - It"s sorted now. Yeah, I hope so. Oh, thank you, that is so kind. - No, you did good. - Mm. It"ll do wonders for my campaign. You know? Well, you should tell my dad that. He doesn"t seem to get it. Well, you know your father. He"s a different era. Keeps a lid on it. It"s what you"ve got godparents for. Mm. Oh, Jesus. Oh, God, it tastes like piss. Do you want some? You"re all right. But there is something I wanted to ask you. Yeah? Say it. Anything. Well, basically.. Yo, Pike! You seen what my man done to my trainers? It"s not even a joke. If we weren"t in public, I"d box him, seriously! - What"s this? - Your first client. Should help with your partnership. Uh... You can"t. Darling, I am the Deputy Mayor of London. - You"re not serious? - Arjana. You"re family to me. Did Ronnie put you... I think Munroe"s got a thing for me, you know? There"s nothing wrong with it. Because he threw up on your trainers? - It"s sign of affection, innit? - Bruv, shut up. - Does anyone want some of this? - Nah, you crack on. - There you go, guys. - My man. Kabali, you"re looking particularly fine tonight. Are you hitting on her, Arkeb? - Flattering, but I dig chicks. - Dig what? Want me to spell it out for you? I"m a lesbian. Don"t look like one. - What does one look like? - Leave while you still can. We do love you, mate! Bless him. You wanker. Tanner told me I"d find you here. You are an arrogant, flash, self-seeking, narcissistic prick. Compliments keep coming. But... I owe you an apology. That you do. And I thank you. This is Kamali and Nell, by the way. Our lovely team. All right. Whatever they"re drinking, I"ll have two. About eight decibels, that was. Ryan Obora, he"s back with his foster parents. He"s been under my care since he was nine and he"s never showed interest in anything, let alone actually told me he liked anything... apart from you. Little shit even said you were cool. Am I missing something? I don"t think so. Shut up, man. You lot. I owe you one. Not like that, pal. Not yet, anyway. Yeah, got to work for it. All right! Well, I think that calls for a toast. - Bishop. - Yes. - You complete wanker. - All right. All right, all right. Nellios. - That"s not a good toast. - How do you get your rocks off when you"re not kicking in doors? I can think of a few things I like to do. You gonna enlighten me or do I have to drag it out of you? I like the sound of you dragging it out of me, if I"m honest! Honestly, can we? Shall we? Let"s do that. Let's do that. - I know you agree with me. - Yeah, yeah. Arkeb, can we get some burgers, mate? 12. Just bring 12. - You right, baby? - Yeah. Are you? Mm-hm. Thank you. Morning. Nice gown. So, how was your night? What the hell... - I"ve got knickers on. - No. No, no. No. Why... good morning. Good morning. I honestly don"t remember what happened. I know what happened! You can"t bring chicks into my yard like that, bro. Not with the girls here. She didn"t have any clothes on! I know, man. I"m sorry. I know you"re getting your swagger back and all that but... don"t you think it's time you kind of thought about, like... Oh, come on, man, we"re family. I like it here. Yeah, so do I! What colour are the pants on, man? Can"t be asking me questions like that about what... Black. Yeah. Now get dressed. We"ve gotta visit Barton with his wife. And how was your night? "Colourful" would be a good adjective. You saying you didn"t know he was a black man or...? As in he called me Sophie and fell asleep. What? Are you serious? Wow! Oh, I"ve got ammo now. Barton"s dead. They"re keeping their cards close. My contacts tell me he had his throat cut in the shower. You lied to me. You fucking lied to me. I didn"t cause Barton's murder. You disobeyed a direct order. If you guys were gonna look for a Luger, where would you start? The same one used by "Ray" to murder Darren Brown, Curtis Cox and Michael Sharp? Jonesy"s back this afternoon. If you"re gonna hit me, mate, let"s not do it here. - I wanna buy a piece. - What are you talking about? Family"s all that matters. Look after yours, my friend. That"s him. Pike! Pike! Argh!
