"Bruv, listen, you've been up there for two hours, bro. What's wrong with you? Come on, man." Yeah, I've got it. I've got it. Are you gonna jump or what? I'm supposed to be somewhere. You think this is funny! You think I won't jump! They want me to jump! Don't you test me! I don't think this is - Don't you laugh at me! I... You don't give... ...a toss about me." Bro, you're meant to be talking him down, not giving him reasons to jump. Come on. Fiver he tells Bish he was bullied. Yeah, or he never went to school. Or that he had to fight. You know what? I'd like to fight you, you know that? Ah, here we go. Are you all right, babe? Yeah, we're all packed and ready to go. "It might be best if you get a cab cos we're slightly delayed." Delayed? "Yeah, you know Bishop, man." He wanted to get some... sun cream. Sun cream. "Yeah, you know he likes to keep looking young and all that." It's a bit late for that. Just promise me you'll be at the airport. Baby, whenever have I let... I grew up in care, mate. Approved schools, prison. No-one, no-one to say they were proud of me. Back here again. It's my only option. No, no, no. Hey, hey. Listen, listen. I think we're about the same age. I do. Obviously life's been a little kinder to me, that's the cocoa butter and all that, but the point is, I understand where you're coming from. You don't understand me. No, I do. You don't understand me. I do. I understand where you're coming from. I was in care myself. OK? So I get it. I remember the little box of chocolates at Christmas. And, fuck, if there's one card on your birthday. You was in care? I was in care, man. I know what it was like to not have parents around to say they're proud of you, I understand. D'you know my mum, my mum left me under the counter at a post office. She left you? Under a counter. With just a picture of her. I've still got it. So you see, mate, we all have reasons to jump, all right? But if I jump, no-one gives a toss, mate. There's no-one gonna be at my funeral, mate. I'm some shitty ex-con. Hey, no, we do. People give a toss, man. Have you ever seen a... Have you ever seen Lethal Weapon? What are you talking about? The film where Mel Gibson and... Never mind. But the point is, you're right.Yeah. You're right. People don't always care about people like us. No-one cares about us, mate. No-one cares about us. So therefore... No, no, no! What are you doing?! Let's jump together. No, no, wait! So we're gonna jump together. Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, don't be sorry, man. Don't be sorry. You're absolutely right. We're mates now, we're mates. Please, please! I don't wanna die! No, please! Listen to me! Don't mess with me! We're going to do it! Not because we've had hard lives, man, and not because we're wallowing in self-pity, but because, honestly, I need a break from people like you. Yeah? So we're gonna do this together. Ready? No, no, no, no! Please? Please?! Actually, you do it! Agh! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Oh, my God! Don't take me! Get off me! Get off me! Really?!

It's just annoying. Yo. Ah, man. How's life with Anna, Bish? Hey. It's complicated. Yo! How does she know about Anna? I dunno. I haven't said anything. You talking my business? Know what I'm thinking of doing tomorrow? What? Bustin' a little celebration for you. Why, what's happenin'? Your birthday. Is it?

Kayla! Girls, let her play with you. Kayla, play nicely. I'm gonna go play with the kids - and mind my own business, like you should be doing. They are so energetic at this age. I know. I'm so sorry, I hope she's not intruding. Not at all. The girls deserve some time off from each other. My name's William, this is my wife. My name's Ronnie. Ronnie. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Arjana. Arjana. Nice to meet you. Hi. Hi. And that's my little Kayla, the little monster running around. She's playing with our kids. He's a little bit too old to be your son, isn't he? That man is not my son. He just acts like a child. Let's just have one word, right? If you really wanna be polite, you then say "baie dankie". Baie dankie. Why are people buying donkeys? Come on. I'm being serious. What's this all about? No, it's like "dan-kie". Baie dankie.Dankie. Thank you very much. So why don't they say thank you very much? Why don't they say that? Girls... I give up. ..who wants ice cream?! Megan, I've got food in the cooler bag. Don't worry. OK, here are your shoes and there's money in the bag for the both of you. Don't wander too far. Be careful. Hi, can I have vanilla? And can I have the same. Thanks. Can you imagine? We actually have some friends living here from college. And they've been dying to take the girls to a safari, but all they wanna do is be on their iPads, or watch TV. We're in exactly the same boat. How aren't they having a good time, I don't understand. They've been gone for a while. Where did they go for ice cream? I don't know. We should check now. Yo. Who are these guys? Bruv, have you seen the girls? Where is she? Kayla knows not to stray too far. She should be here somewhere. Kayla! Megan, just relax, OK? I can't see her. I can't see her. Kayla! Donna. Kayla. Kayla! Donna. There, look. Donna. Donna! Donna, are you OK? Yeah. Where's Kayla? She was just there. When did you last see her? There. What? Where is she? Where's my daughter?! Kayla! Kayla! Listen, listen. She can't be more than 100 yards away. We just can't see her. I'm gonna air drop my contact details to you, let's split up, OK? Arjana, go with Megan. William, check out the ice cream van. We're gonna take the beach, yeah? Megan, Megan, just breathe, OK? Kayla! Kayla! Have you seen a little girl? She's wearing like a pink top. Hi. Hi, guys, how are you? Have you guys seen a little girl with a pink top exactly like yours, and this bag? No, sorry. Are you sure? Nothing? - Look, I found the satchel. - "Listen very carefully. We have your daughter. Go home and wait for us to contact you. Call the police and you'll never see your daughter again." But just - Hello? Hello? Oh, God. Somebody just took my daughter. OK. Stay calm. They might be watching. Come on, guys, you have to do something. You know the police here are underpaid. They're undermotivated. They can't help that family, but you can. What if it was Donna? ...it's not the UK, it's gonna be different. I know. I just wanted these girls to have a holiday. They've been through enough. But you're right. What sort of dad would I be if I walked away from this one? Are you saying, are you in? Yeah, man. Whatever you wanna do. Let's do it. Listen, you get the family safe, I'm gonna meet you at William's. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Something. Hey. Hey. I lost my phone. We don't usually get phones in here, but I'll check in the -Please, yes. It's like a pink little thing. Maybe check like down there. I can catch you with it. Isn't that your phone? Oh, I've found it. She's found it. Thank you. Bye. Can... Can I at least put my number in it? Email? Yo. There he is. You guys were great. Thank you so much. Thank you. It took skills to get this, you know? All right, here we go. There she is, there. Are you sure? Yes, that's Kayla. Megan, just relax. Just breathe. Hold on, hold on. Let me wind it back. She's there. There, there, there. Yeah, there's Donna. Look, him. Yeah, I see him. Listen, guys, why don't I... What if I did call the police and give them this footage. How would these people even know I did that? What did they say when you spoke to them? What else do you expect me to do? They said do not phone the police. I am trying to help them! What do you want me to do? Guys, guys. Look, look, look. We've got something to tell you. We are the police. Yeah, we're supposed to be on holiday. Oh... Excuse me. We need to think about motive. A person or persons you may have upset. Let's start with the obvious. Where do you work? In a shop. It's highly unlikely I would upset anybody selling fuckin' jeans! Megan! Just breathe! They're trying to help us. I'm sorry about that. Yo. Listen, if that's them, speaker phone. Quiet. Yeah? Don't answer back, just breathe. Stay calm. "Daddy!" Kayla. "She's comfortable. Do what we ask and she stays that way. You work at DeKroos. We know. We know they have a new deposit of rubies in their vault. Get the stones, you get your daughter back." Yeah, but I can't just access - "You will find a way if you want to see your daughter again. You understand?" Yeah, but I just can't - "Shut up!" Tomorrow morning we will provide you with fake rubies to swap out. That way, no suspicion will be raised. The DeKroos facility closes at five pm. If we do not get the stones by then, we feed your girl to the sharks. D'you get me? Tomorrow we'll send you details of where to leave the rubies. "Don't try anything funny. We will kill her." Sir, listen, don't - Hello? Guys, guys. I'm sorry, I really am. But we have to move forward, yeah? What do you do for DeKroos? I'm a board member. I oversee the gemmology department, that's what I do. So how do you get access to the vault? I don't have access. Can you find out how to get access? Not without looking suspicious. OK. OK. So these rubies they're talking about, how much are they worth? Four, five million, maybe more. In rand? In dollars. Look, police corruption, extortion, kidnappings, this is South Africa. These things don't end well, yeah? That's why we're gonna get her first. Yeah. And trust us, we'll find her. Growing up too quick. Shall I check up on Megan, see how she's coping? Uh-uh, nah, nah. Invite them here... if you have to. Don't go to their house. Someone might be watching. Hey! Don't leave my sight. Mum, I'm almost 17. Did I ask how old you are? Do you want to come back upstairs? Tsk. Baby, what's this? Just a pregnancy test. Yeah, I know what it is. I mean, like, why? I'm late. It's just a precautionary measure, OK? Yo. Yo. Hey, what's that? Let me have one. No, no, it's nothing, bruv. Listen, we've gotta go, man. William's picking up the fake rubies from the waterfront now. But I was gonna get a treatment. A treatment? You need counselling, bruv. Hey, let's go, and put your clothes on. Any sign of the kidnappers yet? No, nothing. Then I guess this is the perfect time to give you this. Happy birthday, bro. It's not my birthday. Yes, it is, bruv. Here. Make a wish, man. That's right, you happy? I'm happy. What did you wish for? That you'd stop giving me stupid cupcakes and pretending it's my birthday. I love you, man. Yeah, you too. Thank you. D'you remember when you were on the roof? When you were talking about your mum leaving you in the post office? Yeah, that wasn't true, man. I was just talking him off the ledge. Bish, why are you lying? Tactics. Why are you lying? C'mon, man, I know it's true. What I don't understand is why you never talk about your mum. I didn't mean it. It was a yarn, a tall tale. It wasn't real, OK? Let's drop it. Why are you shutting me down? I'm not shutting you down, bruv, it's cos you're talking nonsense. Nonsense. You're my family, all right? You and your wife and your kids. I don't want anyone else, I don't need anyone else. And you know you shouldn't be bringing me cupcakes. Cos you know I'm on an eating plan. I don't know what you're trying to do. You're a feeder. Black bag, yellow bin. We need to find out who just dropped them. The photographer might've seen something, you know? Listen, come? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hey, how are you doing? Morning. I just wondered if I could get a picture with you guys? Sure. Show me how. Yeah, it's just there. OK. How are you doing, guys? Good. Let's take a picture. Nice and close. OK. On three. One, two, three. What have we got? Yeah, body. Yeah, look. In the bin. Guy in the blue cap. These criminals love their primary coloured hats, don't they? Is that a thing? Must be. How do I zoom on this thing? Here. What, you're a tech brother now, yeah? It just says "zoom". I ain't got my glasses on. All right. There we go. That van. Something... haven Missionary Church. Hello. Hey, William, I'm sending you something. Let us know what it says. "It's something... haven Missionary Church."All right. It says... Klaverhaven. That's a small missionary town just outside the city. That's a bit of slim lead, don't you think? Morning, Jonas. "Yeah, slim lead or not, that's all we've got to go on. You just focus on getting yourself access to that vault." Yeah, I'm doing it now. William. Hey, Jonas. What are you doing in here? It's, er, a long way from the top floor. It is. Megan and I's anniversary is coming up, so I thought why not pop in here, pick a beautiful stone for her. Yeah, just trying to get security clearance. Nice. Hmph. How long have you been married? 15 long ones. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Listen, I did want to pick your brain about something. Er, let's get a coffee. Yeah, coffee's good. Shall we? Bro, we don't even know if this van's gonna be here at this church. What are we gonna do if he's not? I don't know. Something. What are you doing? I'm just trying to blend in. Try it. This ain't Soul Train, we're looking for someone. He's got no rhythm. Put some money in. Sorry. Me put some money in? You put some money in. I don't carry cash. Tsk. Hey, whoa. Oh, sorry, little man, I didn't mean to scare you. You wanted to play with this, yes? Yeah. I'm afraid I can't give it to you, buddy. Please? No, see, I kinda need this. And God can't help me but these can. Can I help? Welcome to our church. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, yeah, actually, we were looking for this guy. I wondered if you recognise him? Please, this is really important. Maybe we can give you something in return.Mmm. Bish. Oh. Yeah, here. No. I want your shoes. You want my shoe... This kid wants my shoes. I know, I know. Give them to him. What? Give him the shoes. Give him the shoe... Bruv, I'm to punch up this kid in a church? You wanna get arrested for beating up a boy over trainers? Please, man. Give him the shoes, man. Can I just have the shoes? Bro, I don't care what I have to do, he ain't getting my shoes. Bona. His name is Joseph Ntsimango. He's a close friend of the church. What's he done? Tell me. Honestly, we don't know. All we know is that we need to find him right now. A girl's life could be at stake. He borrowed our truck a couple of days ago. I haven't seen him since. He's not a bad person, he's just... he's strayed from the Lord lately. So where do you think Joe might be now? Listen. Bro. Hang on. I didn't give up my trainers for no reason. Look, I know this must be hard for you. We haven't got much time. We need to know. Now. Yo, babe, listen. We're heading to a motel on the west side. I think we're on to something, I can feel it. "How are the girls?" Yeah, they're here. I can see them playing. "Good. Keep an eye on them. Love you." All right, I'll call you later. Megan's here. Love you, too. Hi. I'm so glad you called. Thanks so much for inviting me over. It's OK. How are you doing? I haven't slept a wink. I can't imagine what you're going through. I woke up in the night... and looked over to Kayla's room, just in case she came home. I'm so silly. Sorry. Come here. Listen. I just spoke to Ron. He said they've got a lead to motel on the west side somewhere, so that's good. Yeah? Fingers crossed. Yeah. Whoa! Back up, bro. Bro, go back. Tell him. You go back! Don't go back. I'm not going back.Good. It's easier for you to move. You! Listen, don't go back, bro. Oh, my God. It's easier for me to move back than him. Obviously, he don't know how to drive. Look at him. Why don't you just give up on life itself? Hey, that's the van there. Oh, my God. Shit. Any signs Kayla was here, bro? Here. She was definitely here, bro. We're English, all right? Police. Move and I will shoot you. We were just leaving. You're murder suspects. You're not going anywhere. This is so fucked, man. William's about to steal five million in stones and we ain't gonna be there. Yeah, I don't even know how we got mixed up in all of this. "Come on holiday, Bish, it'll be relaxing," you said. That's what you said to me. This ain't relaxing, bro. Hold on. You invited yourself. How did I invite myself? You said, "Bishop, we're going on a family holiday..." You're in luck, boys. The cleaner reported the shots before you arrived. That doesn't explain what two English boys are doing at a murder scene in a shithole Cape Town motel. So you care to enlighten me here? We're just on holiday, man. Yeah, we're just bumming around, looking for somewhere cheap to stay. Really? No, you're right. We're actually looking for the Hilton, but service and GPS mapping is just terrible here. I don't even know how you live in this country. Looking for the Hilton? Yeah. Looks like you're in the wrong place. Clearly. You're the joker, right? Clown to this straight married guy? Hmm. It's you. I thought... Bro, it's him. You won the Perception Olympics in 2020. I was there. Great event. You were fantastic. I bet you're a whizz at Sudokus, man. No? Five. Guys, where are you? It's almost time. "You heard what they said on the phone. They'll kill her." I'm going in to the vault, I've got the fake rubies with me. Please, call me. Can you open the window or something, this is affecting me. Are you trying to kill us before we get to prison? What's going on? What are you even vaping? Leopard shit? Sorry, boys, it's apple, but I'm trying to quit the darn thing. So, did you guys know the deceased before? Oh, then I guess he'll just be another statistic, eh? These kids get themselves into - Pull over the fuckin' car. Hey? Yo. You should know by now, even in chains you can't stop our people. Ah, come on. Seriously? Really? Come on, man. We cut you some slack, how about you cut us some? I can only apologise, man, but when it comes to kids he doesn't mess around. It's a shame, cos I think you guys are decent guys, especially you. Wakanda forever. We've got shit to do, bro. I saw that movie twice, by the way. Yeah, course you did. That's what they all say. Go, P. Oh, seriously! William, I'm here. Listen to me. You're gonna have to go through with the swap, all right? Don't worry about it. I'll be in the building if you need me, yeah? "OK, thank you." All right. Bro. Yeah. Scope the area, see if there's any sign of Kayla and the kidnappers. All right, man. In a bit, later. Sir. Good day. I need to certify some rubies before they're shipped off to Zurich. I'm afraid it's rather urgent. Right. Sir, that requires... Electronic recognition. Exactly. Um, your thumbprint here, please, sir. Sure. It seems to be rejecting you, sir. Er, that's OK. I'll try again. OK. Thumbprint again, sir. Ah, there you are, sir. If you'll please follow my colleague. Yeah... Yo, P, I got 'em. It's the same black van that blocked us in at the motel. Yeah, the same one. All right. Thank you. Right, sir, your thumbprint again, please. And there we are. Box 2507. Thank you. Nobody's allowed in the vaults alone, I'm afraid. Just procedure. Sorry, sir, an alarm's been triggered. We have to evacuate the vaults immediately. Is everything OK? Should be fine. We just need to get out of here. Quickly now, please. Yo. Which one of you hit me? Cos whoever it was -Who are you?! What do you mean, who am I? I know you're watching us. I wasn't watching you. Are you police?! No, what part of me -Don't lie to me! But I'm not lying to you. I was waitin' for my Uber to take me to Boulders Beach to see the penguins. I didn't know they liked sand. Who knew penguins liked sand? I didn't! Oh, er, it might be my husband. "Yo, Bish, William's got the rubies. We're heading to the exchange point right now. Are you ready for the switch, yeah?" I don't think that's my phone. Oi.Daddy.Stones first, then you get your girl back. How old are you, man? Does it matter? Just asking. What? Huh?! I'll shoot you, old man! Daddy! Go, go! Respect your elders, you little bitch. Kayla! Let go, you stupid fuckin'...! Out! Now! Ooh! Oh, my God! Agh! Daddy! No! Daddy! Daddy! Get in! Daddy! Go, go, go! Move! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drop your weapon! Hey, hey, hey. Drop your weapon. Surrender yourself! Drop your weapon! Hey, relax, relax. Relax. Put it on the ground. Putting it down. OK? Putting it down. Put your hands on your head. Turn around! A load of guys in here are really gonna like you two. Listen, we're British police, and we're looking for that missing girl. I think we might be in a bit of trouble here, you know? London Man here, don't play with us. I'm not sure if I'm ready for another child. You should be looking for my daughter! This is Officer Dewald. I require urgent assistance at Red Hill. Tell me where the missing girl is. Throw! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
