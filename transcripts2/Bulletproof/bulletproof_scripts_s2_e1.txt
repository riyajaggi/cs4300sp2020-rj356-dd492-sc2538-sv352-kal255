 You're late. Yo, P. This is a madness, man. These fools out here doing big deals, making big money, while I'm here freezing my batty off in the cold for only 46 a year. Bro. I can't lie. It's nice and warm in here, you know. If you learnt how to drive properly, maybe you wouldn't be out there freezing. Once again, your stink old attitude... - My attitude? - ... painted you into a corner, bro. Yo, P, don't get me vexed, man. Don't get me vexed.

 - I'm dying of frostbite in here. - Don't get you vexed? I'm just saying. You do this shit to yourself. Always moaning, "I ain't doing this or that." When has my attitude ever got in the way of anything? - Oh, here we go. Like now. - Shut up, man. You shut up. Red cap's on. Are we doing this? I feel like 12 Years A Slave in here. Bruv, keep still, don't move. Wait for them to do something. The cap's on. That was the go-sign. Let's go. iWait for them to do the deal, bruv. Oh, shit! That his phone? Come on! Get out!

 Go, go, go! Armed police! Nobody move! - Move! Let's go! - Nobody move! - Don't shoot! - On your knees! - Cool? - Oi! Come on, then. Yeah? Come on, then. - Fuck you, mate! - No, no, no. Bish! Where you at? Bish! Bish, what, you ignoring me, yeah? All right, mate. OK... so... ... firstly... my trainers are ruined. And then you, with the brick, that wasn't fair, man. But let's just stop this now... before anyone else gets hurt. All right? Argh! Argh! Argh! Argh! Yo. - Yo, bruv. - Yeah? I was calling you, man. What's wrong? Got a thing for that, man? What's wrong with you? Nah, nah, it's like you wanna break up with me. What's going on? - No, man, I love you. - You sure? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Come here. Book 'em, man. I'm knackered. I just don't understand how you could have your phone on You're at work, man. What do you say to your mates? "Yeah. Ooh-ooh. It's me, Munroe. Give us a call during a raid..." That's fair, but I don't think I actually do sound like that. - That's exactly how you sound. - Bro. Gotta start using your brain, man. Ohh... here we go. It's your turn, bruv. - You all right? - Brilliant. You're familiar with the saying, "Don't shoot yourself in the foot?" - That goes for everyone around you. - They tried to kill me. I know the feeling. So, multiple injuries and not a single piece of evidence. Uh, ma'am, we got a cab, if you need a ride. Ha-ha. That's hilarious, Pike. - Whoa. - You gotta be kidding me. There's the evidence. Ever get the feeling we're on the wrong team? Every day. - Synced and corrected by chamallow - Yo. Uh, morning. I made you... eggs and toast on the off chance you wanted eggs and toast. I don't know if you do but I like it. OK. Sweet. Erm, do you mind if I shower? - Nah, first door on the right. - OK, and then I just... - let myself out? - Just let yourself out. I trust you. Nothing to steal in here, anyway. And if you did, I'd catch you 'cos I'm a police officer. - OK. - Yeah. Sorry. I erm... - ... forgot your name. - Ah, Bishop. - Right. That was it. Sorry. - Yeah. Anyway, I gotta go. Um... - ... Lana. - There we go. That's the one. Bye-bye. - See you later. - Bye. Yo. Yo! What? No love for your Uncle Bishop? - What you saying, fam? - "Fam?" Since when did you start talking like a gangster? Don't kiss your teeth at me! Don't forget your manners, you know. - Yo, what's happening? - Nothing. - What you doing? - Homework. - What homework? - Maths. - Maths? I don't like maths. - Me neither. - What? - You change your hair? - No. - Mm. You know who's got an attitude problem? - No, I don't. - I was talking about the big one. But you do, too, as it happens. - You all right? - Mm. - What's that I smell? - That's my pheromones. Man. - Mm? That's woman. - It's not woman. Leave me alone. - Where is he? - He's there. Remember to breathe and keep your breath focused. - Man, what are you doing? - I'm chilling, man. It's the new me. Chillin'? Is that why I nearly got stabbed yesterday? Well, you nearly got stabbed because you're mad and you like to run men down all the time. - You should try chilling yourself. - I am gonna chill. - This is my chillin'. - Yeah? What do you say? Feeling the new ride, yeah? Nah, man. I prefer the old one. You'd have all met DI Scarlet Hailton, joining us on probation from the CPU. - She'll be shadowing our other newbie, Paige. - Right. Child Protection Unit, mate. So, despite a near disaster... ... a million pounds was recovered from a drugs deal yesterday. Some criminal somewhere will be hurting... and that makes me happy. Find out who this belongs to. Whoever owns this money is a target for us. Let me introduce you to Deputy Director Richard Cockridge. Richard's here for some tactical advice, as well as a shoulder to cry on. You know how it goes. Richard? Thank you, Sarah. The circumstances which I come in aren't easy. Right? Last year was a tough one. And we lost someone that we held very dear. I don't wanna keep you from fieldwork, but I'd like to have a little chat with you all individually at some point. I am at the end of the corridor, in the box room. So come and see me. Yeah? When you've just got a minute. And... mind your head on the way in. Ha. Yeah. - Wait. - He was quite nice. Stop it. Cockridge. - Cock... ridge. - Will you stop? - I can't be the only person that heard it. - It's just his name, innit? Shut up, man. - Yo, baby? - Ronnie. - What's wrong? - I need you. I'm in the hospital. All right, I'm coming there now. I'm on my way. - Yo, you good? - No. Arjana's friend just overdosed. - Glenmore! - Hey, hey. Sit down. - Sit down and do some homework. - Come here, Bish. Grace never let anything get in the way of her work. She was a good lawyer. - Certainly not an addict. - All right, baby. I've got you. All right? I'll run an enquiry when we get the toxic report. Get the guys to have a snoop. I'll see what I can find out from the doctors. What's happened to the door, man? Listen, man, there was a time barbershops was off limits. I mean, who robs a barbershop, anyway? Who's gonna trim their heads? Do you know who did it? Want me to deal with it? Deal with it, how? It's 'cos there no food on the streets. There's a drought out there, Bish. These gangs, they're not shotting no more. They're just... Just robbing old men like me. City's gone lawless, bruv. All these bodies are drug related. They all died from an unusual cocktail of experimental drugs. Pharmaceuticals, solvents... What would you do if you couldn't score your drug of choice? Me? It's hypothetical, mate. Do what these people did and mix some other shit together. Come on, guys. Let's raise a glass to the newbie. To Scooch. Where is that name from, by the way? Is that Bulgarian or something? I had trouble spelling Scarlet at school, - so "Scooch" was sort of easier. - Plus, Scarlet's a bit sorry, so... Yeah, I mean, "Scooch" doesn't seem that much easier to spell. - Not to you. - Psst. Yo. Hello. Brother. Listen... I just think... I was at the barber today, not that any of you noticed... - I did. - Thank you. ... and Glenmore said the barbershop hadn't been robbed in 30 years until this week. It's hard times. The streets are dead. Well, that doctor from the hospital, he said none of the overdose victims died from Class-A drugs, as well. - Didn't stop them, did it? - Someone's making a move. Yeah. Supply and demand. Loads of gangs do it. The stronger the market... - Cause a drought. - Put something new on the street. What was you gonna say, Scooch? I was gonna say that. - Sure you were. - Yeah, course you were. - I was. I was! - I told you. You gotta shout to be heard with this lot. We find out where that million pound was going, we find out who's trying to supply the new drugs. Our informant Red Cap works with these guys. Let's pay him a visit. What you doing, Red? Where you going, Red? - No. - Come here, come here. Listen. Them boys you're moving weight with. - Who supplies them? - No idea. I'm just a gopher. - I dunno. - All right. - I'll slap you, you know. - Please don't. - Fuck. I don't know. - No, no, he DOES know! - That's what I think. - Box him again! Argh! Please, man. I don't know anything. - Please. I don't know. - Bro. - I don't know. - What do you know, fam? Argh! All right. I just know... I had a deal from a health club called Pallas, in Dagenham. There's this app and courier service. - That it, yeah? - Yeah. Get home. Hm? App. - Company like Deliveroo or something? - Yeah. - That was all right, bro. You got skills. - Yeah, man. - How's Arjana going? - Hit her hard, bro. We're dealing with it. Bodies on stationary bike, waiting on product. - They look like a bunch of cocks. - En route. Remember, this lot are connected to those responsible for several deaths. Including my wife's friend. You're outgunned at all times. Got it? Copy. Hold tight till Pike and Bishop show. This lot ain't going anywhere. - Questions? - I've got a question about protocol. There is none. You just... take 'em out. OK. Suspects about to go mobile. Give us a sign, mate. Come in? Shit. We're gonna lose them. It's our chance to be heard. Let's get out of here! - Behind you? - What? Nice driving, mate! Scooch! Ohh. Thanks, mate. Mate, I am not messing with her. Where were you? - We had you covered. I was just literally about to... - Good job. Hello. - Name of your supplier? - Fuck off. - Does that change anything? - Markides. Hm? Didn't quite get that. Markides. - Markides? - You make it sound familiar, ma'am. Well, I dealt with an Eleanor Markides years back. Fuckin' horrible old cow. But I can't imagine she's supplying cocaine to street gangs. Up now. Yeah. Yeah, that's her. Was a compliant witness in a people-smuggling case. I even had the fucker down the pub. Until I found out she actually ran the gang that were in the dock. The evidence was tainted after that, and they all... - Bad seed. - Kid, pull up the Markides and see who else comes up related to them and ping it to the team. Markides, they hail from Cyprus. Fingers in all sorts of pies. Restaurants, property, scrap. And that's just the legitimate ones. Make no mistake, these animals, they trade in filth. Right, on the main screen now, Alex Markides, brother of Eleanor. Yep, I met him. - Loved a shell suit. - Yeah. Runs a scrap business. Yeah, right He's got a daughter called Anna who works in property. Mikey Markides, Eleanor's son, loves a bit of social media. FYI, CO-19 had eyes on him but it fell away. - Wow. He's growing up fast. - Last post, 15 minutes ago. According to CO-19, he mixes with some heavy hitters. So, what do you think, Bishop? Wanna shake a stick at a tree? No, ma'am. I wanna pull the whole tree down. If he can lose a million quid and still be out partying a couple of nights later, I'd say he's worth bringing down. Come on, man, it's not moving. Come on. Wakey-wakey, people! May I help you, darlin'? - I just feel bad, bro. - Yeah. Like, being here. She's at home. - Mm. - Doing homework with the kids. - She's had a hard day at work as well, you know? - Yeah. - Speaking of the kids... - Yeah? Since when did Ali become a gangster? She calling me fam and cuz and all this business. I don't know. In the last year, she's just flipped the game on me. I was taking her to the park last year, swings and whatever. Now she wants her belly button pierced. - Belly button pierced? - Yeah, man. She's gun-leaning, they're doing drill music. - What?! - I dunno. - I don't know how to keep up with her. - I'm telling you. Is one ready, Andre? One is ready, Tyrone. Oi! What's wrong with you? - Keep the noise down, man. - Yeah, shut up! Stop waving a bottle of champagne around like you won the Grand Prix, you fool. - So, anyway, I'm saying... - Mm. Me? Yeah, you. You and your fucking dickhead friends. Keep the noise down or I'll kick your fucking heart out. - Are you joking, bruv? - Do I look like I'm joking? You don't. Does he look like he's joking? Do we look like we're joking? You wanna watch your fucking mouth, man. Action Man. Who the fuck are these guys? Hey. Hey, let's go fucking cut this man up. Me and Dez'll go and do it. I'm saying, mate, they proper don't want to answer. - You should ground her. - Ground her? I'm not grounding her. She's a big girl. - I can't ground her. - That's the problem with kids. They think they're big but they're not. If you set boundaries... From the gentleman at the bar, sir. With apologies. Let me have a look at that, bruv. - What's that, a '62? - I don't know. Cheers. - Yeah, cheers. Thanks. - Take care. So, I'm saying, if you set the boundaries... - What's going on? - Oi, lads, you two... - Us two what? - What? I don't know what you two are. Well, I do know, man. I know what you are. And what are these, your testicles? - You can shut your mouth as well. - He said that already. He's like a parrot. Get fucked. Dezzy, let's sort them out. Mikey, let's sort them out. I'll tell you what. Why don't you have that champagne over here with us? Are you mad? We don't know who these guys are. Dezzy, I gotta be home before ten. - I'm on a tag, brother. - We ain't drinking with these guys. Now I'm definitely coming. I will definitely come and have a drink with you. - You need to go, right? - Yeah. I'm not drinking with this fucking guy. - Don't worry about it. It's cool. - You want this? Nah, I'm good. Tell them I'm cool, man. See you later, fellas. Audemars for sure, yeah? That is a strong piece, man. That and the Patek Nautilus are my favourite watches. Tidbit. You know they were designed by the same man, right? Rival salons, same guy. 1976, Gerald Genta. Try that? That is beautiful, man. Hello? I knew Tyrone from back in the days. And then he got a long stretch for robbery. Since he come out, he's just been keeping his head down. What about you? You done much time? I just like getting in places, not staying in them. - I'll drink to that, bro. - Yeah, man. Hey, Brandon, get a photo of me and Andre for Insta. No, no, I don't... I don't really do that business. I like to keep my face out of it. All right. You get one of me and my boys, then. Three, two, one. - Got it. - Beautiful. Yeah, man, that's a good one. Listen, tomorrow night... ... my club. My shout. All right, man. I'm there. All right. - One more for the road, yeah? - One more for the road. Let's do that. Mm. Think we should ground Ali? Ground her? For what? I just think that she's missing out on her childhood. Mm. Now she's really settled, babe. - What? - Hello? - Ah, go away, man! - I really need the toilet. - Use the one downstairs! - At least we got a lock... No, but why do they wait until we're in the bath every time? Oh, babe. Come on. She's gonna be next, you know. She's gonna want her belly button pierced like her sister. And I'll bust her craw if she does. No, you won't. Mm. So, uh, in the meantime... Mm. - Permission to go below deck? - Permitted. Mm. Where's my daughter? Dad, it's me. Here you go, Sarah. That should cover him until the new year. Cheers. Thanks, Milly. See you later. What's that? For your new mate, yeah? Yeah, man, he loves a watch. You sound jealous, darling. I am jealous. So, you sure that's your guy? Yeah, well, we're gonna find out tonight. Tonight. He's not just a rich kid. He's in the game, I'm telling you. Listen... my marriage nearly fell apart last year, bro. Ain't letting it happen again. I made promises. Yeah, I know. A lot of stuff happened last year. We got a window of opportunity tonight. We should use it. "We"? You. Branch Commander Tanner, OCC. Impounding retrieved money from operations. Yep. Go through. Oh! - Bruv, you got a Nautilus as well? - Yeah, man. You're into the same watches as me? These fools are still playing with Rollies and that. - Patek got nothing on Rolex, cuz. - Wow. Since when did you become a watch expert, Dezzy? No, I'm just saying, man. Daytona's no joke, is it? You standing up for yourself now, Dezzy? Yeah, man. I'm a big man now, innit? Yeah. Um... - Dezzy, come here. - Huh? - Come here. - Look, Mikey, man, I was just saying. Come here. Oh, yeah. Hold that for me, please. - Why are you sweating? - I'm not. I'm good, man. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What's wrong? - It's good, man. I'm good. Hey, what you doing, man? - Come on. Come on, mate. What you doing? - Hm? Hm? - Oi, that's hot, man. - Mikey, leave it. He was just chatting shit, right? Mikey, man. Argh. - It's getting hot, man. - Let this one go, yeah? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You were chatting shit? Ah. Ahh. Mikey! - Were you chatting shit? - Sorry! Why you kissing me, Dez? Now, come on, man. You saw his face. Dezzy, you all right? Whenever you feel like you're ready to graduate to one of these bad boys, let me know and I'll sort it out. Hold up. Police took a million quid off our boys the other day. We'll have to shift some weight before anyone goes watch shopping. Bruv, it's no joke. Boys were shot up, you know. So, you're telling me you let the police take a million pounds off you? No-one let 'em. They swooped in on us, didn't they? So take it back. Yeah. The money. You heard me. Take it back. - How? - Ask them nicely How do you think? Are you gonna walk into a police station, yeah? Won't be in a police station. It'll be in a holding depot. "It'll be in a holding depot." I thought I walked into the club that said "bad men" on it. Obviously I'm in some other club, so I'm just gonna leave right now. Well, why don't you take it back? Sorry? You like getting into places. Get our money back for us. - Mm-hm? - That shut you up, didn't it? - No, not really. No. - No? All right, so you'll do it? I'm gonna scope it out. If I think it's worth the risk... then I'm gonna get it done. But I'm not gonna do it on my own. Music in here's shit, man. Tremendous idea, Bishop And when I pitched the notion of staging a burglary to steal confiscated money and give it back to criminals, - Really? - No! 'Cos he laughed me out the fucking door! - Come on, Bishop. - How else are we supposed to get the Markides? At least, this way, we control the outcome. Listen, if you want Eleanor, this is the way to get her. Mikey is moving big product. He organised that drought. He's got an ego. This is gonna work. - Cockridge was never... - Fuck Cockridge! We don't even have to tell him. We're actually catching criminals. We don't just come to work, cash our cheque and go home in our Primarni suit. If... Yes! If I could pull some strings and talk to a colleague, - how would you get into the strong room? - Got that covered. CCTV at the depot has a blind spot. I leave the outside door open for easy access. Also, we know how to deal with the safe. All we need to do is remove the security and put our own people in. And who would be daft enough to volunteer? How do I look, Bish? Ma'am, is that a yes? That's a yes, isn't it? If it's a no, say no. That's a yes. We're on, guys. Round the team up. How do you know it's in there, bro? 'Cos it's the East London holding depot. Shut up, Tyrone. All you need to do is sit in here with Mikey. - You do know I'm on a fucking tag? - Boys, chill out. - Brandon, let's go. - Yeah, fuck it. I'm coming too. Hey, hey. Hey, Mikey, just... Relax. We'll deal with it. You stay here. No, I'm having some fun, man. Here we go. Argh! Mask up. - Yeah, Mum? - Why are there three bodies climbing that fence? 'Cos that fucking lunatic Mikey wanted to go and we couldn't tell him no. Bish is gonna leave the door open just in case we need to make a move. (SIGHS) Fine. ♪ 21 seconds to go ♪ ♪ 21 seconds to flow ♪ ♪ 'Cos if you like me let me know ♪ ♪ Let me in da studio ♪ ♪ I got 21 seconds before I gotta go ♪ All right, get inside. Keep the noise down. - Oh, there he is. - There's our boy. - There he is. - He looks the part, right? - Shh. - He's doing good. Uh... you all right, boys? Fuckin' stay where you are. Yeah? - "Oi, geez, what's going on 'ere?" - Calm down. Calm down. Let's just take it easy. Take it nice and easy. OK? Right, just stay... Stay where you are, yeah? Just... Let's just... Fuckin' hell, man. This guy's a fuckin' madman. Oh, shit. Well done, mate. Let's go. No! - Why are they taking him with them? - Why's he taking him? - Over there. - This? Yeah. Shit. Get a message to Bishop. Tell him that Munroe's in danger. Ma'am, he'll be in the strong room. You can't contact him. Just stay very... ... quiet. - He's got something else in his hand. - OK. OK. - Fuck, it's a flame! - Right. OK, you two. Jonesy, Paige, get in there! Go, go, go, go, go! - Yo. Yo, what's going on? - Pike, it's all going tits up! Oh, fuck! All right, the door's meant to be open. Argh! Fuck! Fuck! Shit. Come on. What we looking for? What was the money in? A bag. Red bag. Argh, fuck! Get us in. Yaargh! - Police! Drop your weapon! - Police. Weapon down! - Step back! Stay there! - Hands where I can see them. I said hands! Back! Now, stay there. Police! Hands where I can see them. Hands up now. Everyone down on your knees now. All three of you. On your knees. You as well. Shut the fuck up. Don't move. Put the guns down, nice and easy. Go on. Right now. Nice and easy. Both of you. Go on. Now! Here. Oi, no! Come on, man. Get their radios. Tie 'em up. Get down, man. Little pussy. Come on, let's go. Let's move! Come on! Look at my hand, man! I'm still shaking. Didn't I tell you we'd get the money back for you? Well done, man! Bro, bro, bro. Calm down, man. We ain't home yet. 10K missing. Must've dropped it on the way out. Fuck it, man, we're sweet. Here y'are. A little tribute. No, no, we're good. Don't need no tribute. I'm here for Andre. I'll tell you what... Why don't you hook us up instead? You wanna be shifting weight? What, are you deaf? Yeah. Yeah, we do. I got more weight than you can imagine. Well, I can imagine a lot. We'll turn that white into green for you 'cos that's what we do. Yeah. It's what we do. 'Cos I don't like getting burned. It's not what I signed up for. - Ain't even gonna mention the punch. - You should. It weren't supposed to knock me out. I'd have gone over anyway. Mate, I know it's boring and procedure, but you've got to cover off all the bases. We could be a man down now. Yeah. For what? You know, where's our win? We're not even close to bringing down the Markides clan. Sorry. There's our win. Hello? - You safe? - Yeah, Mikey, what's up, man? You wanted in. You're in. Meet us tomorrow. - Don't fuck it up, bruv. - All right. We good? We're good. Listen... ... what you did was a mad thing, bro. It was a good thing but it was a mad thing. And now we're in. Gotta make it right with them, though. Bruv, come on, man. OK, so... I know today was a bit... ... you know, and so, in light of everything that's happened, I know it was... so I just wanted to kind of... say that I'm... - I'm obviously... - Bruv, sit down! Sit down. That was pathetic. - I mean it. - Let me finish. Hey, what you doing? What, you thought this was a friendly chat? - Where were we? - I believe you were about to kill me. - Synced and corrected by chamallow -
