 The definition of a successful police officer is a hero. Do you not understand why I never mentioned you, - why I tried to pull away? - To get to Daddy. You are off the Markides case effective immediately. Police! Police! Nobody move! Bish, where you at, man? I'm on Elena. ♪ Look, look, look, look, look, look, look... ♪ And a bottle of brandy, please. How old are you? Old enough.

 That is £25.80, please. Anyway, what you doing later? Sorry, what? Are you joking? All right. Never mind. ♪ Look, look, look, look, look... ♪ All right? All right? Give me a tin, bruv. - Fucking boy, you mug. Give me the bottle. - Sorry, mate. You look a bit rough. Put the bag down and get the fuck out of here right now. Did you see anything out of the ordinary up there? No, it's dead as usual. That's all.

 Alex, I've got to get out of here, man. - This is getting worse. - Just a few more days. A few more days? Look at the fucking state of me. Got to get to hospital, man. Look, Mum got away clean. Why can't we? Because your mother didn't kill a police officer. Oh! You relax, man. What's wrong with that kid? Always getting the wrong thing, man. I'll call him back. He's going to have to come back. I swear if I see them two boys again they'll be even more dead than that police officer. Are we good? Well done, Officer. - You ready? - Of course. Then let's get 'em. Right. Listen in. For those of you are not in the loop, Tanner has been stood down for personal reasons. And I have assumed tactical command for this operation. So now it is possible that the Markides made it back to Cyprus. But if they haven't, we will find them. On your desks are locations for raids. We will hit them where it hurts. We work as a team and we will neutralise targets. We answer to Tanner, not you. Well, you answer to no-one because you are no longer with this investigation. In fact, for coercing with your fellow officers, I could have your badge. You want my badge? Come and take it. I dare you. - You dare me. - I dare you. Oh, God, you're hysterical. You have your orders. - Any of you lot know about this Tanner situation? - No. - No, nothing. - All right, listen, I'm gonna go check and find out what's going on. In a bit. Listen, the Markides have been hiding in plain sight the whole time. If we're going to do it, we're going to do it our way. - It might cost our badges. - Not exactly selling it, mate. I'm not trying to. Either you want to roll or you don't. If you do, Arkep's, one hour. That's my fucking paniculata. Ma'am, why are you ignoring my calls? You know if you needed money, you could have just asked for it. You haven't got any. Could have found it. Could have helped you. I don't know, Bish. Maybe I should have done. It was just there. Drug money. My old man's lost the plot. I thought fuck it. Who cares? I do. About the money? No. About you. I'm not a judgy person, ma'am. But you did always tell us to keep our hands out the cookie jar. So you do listen then? You want a chance to make up for it? What? Like doing some time? What if I told you that I found Alex and Mikey Markides? Bishop, you understand, I offered my badge. I do understand, ma'am. I just don't care. - Yo! - Yo, man. - You heard from the rest of the unit? - Not yet. Any news from Tanner? Speak of the devil and she will appear. There you go. All right, ma'am. Thank you. Listen. Next time you need any help, just ask us, yeah? - Exactly. - Yeah, yeah. Thank you. I understand. - Thievy! - Thief! I underst... Hey, listen. Stop it. Stop it. Bish has filled me in, right? The kid on the bike is our access in. Once they open up for him, we move in. - We expecting any backup? - I've contacted some friends from SCO19. And the party line is that we just didn't have time to inform Cockridge. Is it just the three of us? Yo! Well, come on then. Let's all get fired. This one. He's en route to you now. - He's just gone past me now. - Got it. Eyes on. Get set, bro. Where's Bishop? - Where's Bishop? - Continue, Bishop, and I will have you arrested for tampering with an investigation while suspended. What the fuck is he doing here? Are you fucking serious? We're just about to go in. Not without my authority you're not. Your radio. - I want it. - Oh, shit! - You want my radio? - I want your radio. He's near the house. Where are you? All units... We're good to go. Stand by. - You, name. - McGrowder, sir. I'm Deputy Director Cockridge. And I need your radio if you want a career, McGrowder. That is a direct order. Target about to land on destination. Seriously, boys, what the fuck? This is about to go south. McGrowder, I will not ask you again. There we are. Good lad. Target is at the door. All units, all units, this is Deputy Director Cockridge. I have tactical command and your order is to stand down. I repeat, stand down. Copy that. Standing down. I warned you from the start that we can be a team or we can be enemies. Yet still you defy my command and act like petulant children behind my back. When there's lives at risk. You forget. See, rank always wins. It was my idea, not Tanner's. Not Tanner's? Why does that not surprise me? You'll be dealt with accordingly. All of you. Right. McGrowder, load up the battering ram. We're going to drag him out. Sir, why stop this operation when we're just about to go in? Because your operation is unsanctioned. Therefore, it is unlawful. So your case will collapse. Please. We've gathered intel. We know what we're doing. You can't just assume command and kick the fucking door down. Watch me. Someone's gonna get hurt. Twat! - Do you wanna play? - Yeah. What the fuck's going on? Agh! Back down! Yo! Drop the gun. - Fuck! Fuck you! - Put it down, man. Bruv, you're shivering, man. You're not a bad boy. Put the gun down. Clear! - Clear! - Clear! - Are you scared, bitch? - No. - Three seconds and I'm shooting you. - We shooting kids now? I'll fucking shoot you, man! - Get on the floor! - Get down on the floor! Get on the floor! You fucking pig! - Get off me. - What's happening? Clear. They gotta be in there, man. Three, two, one... Where the fuck have they gone? Clear in here, ma'am. This is bullshit. Fuck! Here. You see? We need to find out where that goes. What is this fucking place, man? Shit! State of this place, man. Here. Just here. Fucking prick! Agh! Fucking pricks! We're OK here for now. I ain't fucking sure about that, man. I'm in pieces. Someone's coming to get us, yeah? Don't worry. This will be over soon. Richard? You all right? I screwed up, Sarah. Yeah, you did. It's OK. I should have listened. So listen to me now. We need road blocks. We need access to sewage works, tunnel complexes and waterways. Can you do that? Good. We need Pike and Bishop working together, uncompromised. - Can you do that? - Absolutely. - We're just doing our job. - I know, I know. I didn't tell anyone. About what? About the money, I didn't... Nobody knows. I didn't report you. You didn't? Thank you. Fucking wounded animals. They can't have got far. I can still smell them. Head to Elena's. If she appears. I want to know. Does this mean you're back in control, ma'am? I was never out of control. I know I'm talking 'cos I can hear myself talking when I talk. Are you deaf or just stupid? Have you seen this man? Well, yeah, but only on the news. Oh, for fuck's sake! - Listen, man. - Bish, Bish, come on, let's go. It was frustrating. I spent more time with him than anyone. I should know where he is. Oh, thank fuck! Here, Alex, help me up. Agh! Remember when you said... you own the future. Hm? What the fuck are you talking about, man? Help me up. How wrong you were. Hm? Alex, what are you talking about? Only one of us has a future. And it is not you. Uncle, stop messing about, man. If you weren't my sister's boy, I would have killed you the very moment you ordered Brandon's death. Agh! You think I don't know what you are? You are a low-life. _ _ Fuck you, man! Go away! Still an animal to the very end. Uncle, please, man. Shit! Eyes on Elena. She's home. And make sure they keep focus, yeah? - Anything? - Nothing. What about the mechanics? Patch me through. Mikey's on the phone to Elena. I can't believe he fucking left! Mikey, baby, calm down. You're not making sense. Who left you, baby? Alex. Fucking Alex. He told me he killed Brandon. He just attacked me and he left. Fuck off! Alex? What? Mum, I'm in a really bad way. Oh, Mikey. I'm fucking scared. I don't want to die! Mikey, you're not going to die. Not today. - I'm sorry. - Let me think. Let me think, baby. Let me think, let me think. Mikey, listen to me. Tell me where you are. - Come on. - What? - I don't fucking know. - Well, look around you, Mikey. Help me. Cheddington Road. Go. Yo, let's get this moved, please. I'm on my way. Don't move. Mum... Mum... I love you. I love you too. Mikey... Michael. Mikey. Sarah? I know you're listening, Sarah. Please don't hurt my baby. He's all I've got. OK, go. Ma'am, she's on the move. Mikey... Don't move, pal. What are you saying, boys? Come on, bro. You need to come in with us. Let's get you to a hospital. How the hell did this happen? I thought we're going to conquer the world together. You know it weren't going to pan out like that, bro. Mikey, let me see your hands, mate. Could have been fun, though, still. Could have been a good little firm. But you fucked me, bro. How do you look your family in the eyes, knowing you ruined mine? You didn't need us to mess up your family. You did that by yourself. - At least I've fucking got one. - Not for long. - I'm going in, ma'am. - Yeah, go that way. Careful. OK. What's going on? The precinct is secure from both ends. Could you put your phone away, please? Just back up a bit, yeah? Come on, Mikey, man. Show us your hands. Mikey. I know you don't want to die out here, bro. Don't I? Mikey! Elena, stop! - Bish... - Let her through. Mikey! - Is you good? - No, I'm not good, I've been shot. - Mikey! - Let her through. Let her see her son. Mikey! Mikey! Bish, how you doing? You all right? Yeah, I'm all right, yeah. - Mikey! My baby! - OK, just give her some space. No! Mikey! - Ma'am. - It's OK, it's OK. Keep back. Elena. You did this! I told you he was all I had. We had no choice. Now my baby is gone. And I'm really, really sorry. You need to know the truth, Elena. - Your brother left him to die. - No! It wasn't Alex. I did this. - I let him run wild and... - OK, I hear you. - Whoa. - OK, OK. - Put the gun down. - Elena. I should be lying here. Don't do anything stupid, Elena. - Hands off the gun or we'll take the shot. - She won't hurt me. - Hey! - OK, she won't hurt me. - OK. - Ma'am. Elena... Give me the gun. Elena... Pass me the gun. Come on. Help us find Alex and they can pay for what he's done. Elena, please. Come on. Come on. It's OK. Come on. Fuck! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Here you are. Thanks. Pike... Don't say it. I can't go on pretending. I'm married. If I believed you were happy, I wouldn't be saying anything. Just... Meet me at that bar that sells the extortionate beer tomorrow night. And I'll know we both feel the same. Nice to see you again. Yeah, you too. I'll go and wait outside. I miss you, Ronnie. Miss you, too. Are we going to make it? Yes. He is going to make it. He is going to make it. God is the law. Yoda. That's Yoda. So you're not dying. Well, I was dying but I've got a healing factor like Wolverine. So now I'm good, man. How are you doing? Yeah. Cool. OK, I'm glad to see you're OK. - I'm going to get a drink. - All right. Yeah. Get me some Frazzles or something. Maybe some Doritos. Are you going to eat all of them? Listen, bruv, this hurt so much I can't even tell you. Don't ever let me get shot again. What were you even doing? - Why are you crying, man? It's a flesh wound. - Flesh wound? I'm not even going to dignify that with a response. Listen... I'm going to check myself out. We've got bad guys to go get. Let's go get them. I'm ready. I want to catch these people just as much as you. But they're either dead or they disappeared, bro. Not all of 'em. Are you proud of yourself? You think I wanted this? We've lost people too. I asked for your help to avoid all of this. Ever since I met you, all you've done is lie. - And now I've lost everyone because of you. - No. No. Because of your dad. You know he even had a chance to save Mikey but he left him to die. You're lying again. I know my dad. - But he just left me. - Mikey, Mikey, baby, calm down. - Who left you, baby? - Alex. Fucking Alex. I'm sorry. I really am. But your dad let his own family die to save himself. - Hey. - Get off me! This isn't just about me and you. This is about everybody that has died already. This is about everybody that is affected by everything that your family does. This is the difference between your dad coming in alive or ending up on a slab like them. Anna, please, if you can do anything to help... ... do it. Darling, how are you? Auntie Elena's dead. What? How? She's dead and the police are saying that you let Mikey bleed to death. I can't believe you left him there. Left him. Come on now. You really think I could do that to my own family? So he was dead when you left him? I held him in my arms as he passed. He was at peace, my darling. I can assure you. Anna... This is hard, I know. But I need you to stay strong for me. My exit out of the country is taken care of. But I need you to make sure I have everything I need on the other side. Can you do that? Yes, Dad. I'll make sure you're taken care of. You know I love you, Anna. I love you, too. Hello? I'll do it. Alex... I know you're in here. Come on, man. You must be tired of me chasing you. I would be. You also know me. So you know that I'm never going to stop. I was going to take it easy on you. But then you showed me who you really are. What you really do. Just another gangster and murderer. Now I kind of have to take you out. Because that's who I am. He's trying to get out in a helicopter! Agh! You think I would let you take me to live my life in a box? I'd rather die, you hear me? Yeah, I'm happy to help with that. Still so funny. Agh! Hey! Don't you fucking dare! Now the other one. As you can see... I need to live. Hey, bro, shoot him. You destroyed my family. I destroy yours. You're about to see how it feels to lose a person you love. Except you're forgetting one thing. We know that you lost the person that you love the most. What are you talking about? Because she saw you for what you are she chose me over you. That's right. Your own fucking daughter, bruv. Shut up! Bish... Bishop! That's it? Huh? That's all you can do? We kill your colleagues and now you can't even kill me. And you know why? Because you're a bloody coward. Bish! Bish! Come on, get on with it. Kill me. You're a coward. You know you nearly had me, right? Had me believing I needed more in my life, but I got everything I need right there. You're a coward. - Coward! - Look at me. Look at me! Remember when you said to me that the worst thing that could ever happen to you would be to spend the rest of your life behind bars. Welcome to your worst nightmare. Alex Markides, I'm arresting you for murder, drug trafficking, racketeering and also some other fucked-up shit. It just flashes blue. I just don't get it. It's actually more complicated than it looks. - But I've got the hang of it. - No-one's interested. I don't get it. They should put him back on the beat in uniform. Richard... - Come on. Here you go. - Thank you. Right. I just want to say that I am proud of all of you and the ones who didn't make it. But you two, more than anything, you've... you've really shown me what it is to be a friend and... and I thank you. Cheers to that. - Cheers, ma'am. - Cheers. All right. Home time. - Home time. - Anyone want a lift? Yeah, I'd love one, thanks. Yes. I'm not paying for an Uber, so... - OK. - See you later. - How convenient was that? - It was weird. Where are you guys really going that you haven't invited us? We have this thing, extracurricular activity, just us... You wish, Monroe. Why are you guys laughing? Listen, I'm tired, man. Maybe that's why I'm just... I'm tired. I'm going to go. Love my bro. - See you later. - Bye, ma'am. Oh, actually, now you said we're friends now, right? - Yeah? - Yeah. You know what we do. Go on, ma'am. - Sort of. - School her. Yeah, I've got it. I've got it. I'm out. You're a good man, Ronnie Pike. You know, whatever's going on at home will sort itself out. I know. - I'll see you later. Take care. - Bye. Tough day for sir? Ask me in a minute. Cheers, man. Wow! - Looking good, Mr Pike. - You too. Long time since we met without the kids in a hotel. Sometimes you just gotta say, fuck it. Nice place you chose. You know I choose you every time, right? I choose you too, Ron. Always. - I'm going to make you miss me again. - Really? My king. Can't wait. Please tell me you booked a room. Ping! Come on, love, what do you take me for? - Got the honeymoon suite. - Yeah? Everything. Come, let's go. Take these upstairs, girl. Thanks, mate. For we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly grateful. Blessed are we in family and in friendship. Thanks for keeping my girls safe. Thank you for keeping my husband safe. - Amen. - Amen. Oh, shit! - Language! - Sorry, man! Yo, ma'am. This better be good. I'm about to tuck into some fried plantain and oxtail soup over here... Leave that for later. - I need the two of you back here as soon as. - What's happening? - Got something big. - All right. We're on the way. Come on, man. We've got to go. Come on. We've got to go now. Go. - Go. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I'll see you later. Got a job now. Don't expect the cake to be here when you come back. It better be here! Come on, man. Let's go. What's up? Your wife better not eat that cake. You know, red velvet is my jam. - If she eats it I'll break up the whole... - Bro, stop messing around. What's wrong? I just... I wanted to say thank you to you. For always... just always being there for me. Come on, man. Door's always open, bro. Yeah, man, I know, but... I know I got caught up with Alex and some of that madness is just... You know, it's hard being alone sometimes, you know. Come here, man. Come on. I got you, man. Yeah? You know, you're never alone. You got us. For life. Safe. You finished all your emotion and that, yeah? - Yeah, man, I'm good. - Let's go. Listen, though. I didn't get to eat. I didn't get my cake. I'm a bit vexed and my stomach's feeling a little bit funny, so I'm just gonna say... I know we need to get there. - I'm just gonna say one thing. - Yeah? - Drive sensibly. - Good luck with that. Yo, listen, how are we supposed to solve crime if we don't get there in one piece? Let's go!
