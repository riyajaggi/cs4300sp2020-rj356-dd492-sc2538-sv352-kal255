 We have a witness to the murder of Leanne Hadley. They're willing to testify that Elena Markides covered up that murder. If you ain't gonna stand up to him, I will. - You're gonna go to war with me! Elena Markides is checking out Bishop's legend online. If I make a deal, would you stick around? Take care of this. I presume you've been treated well enough. Game face on, bro. We're nearly home. Yeah. Boys,

 we've got something big I want to look into when we get back. Yeah, man. Sounds good to me. Good. In the meantime, want a game? - Sure. If you're ready to lose. Come on, Mike, let's move, man. Good, yeah? Where are we, bro? I can't see the London Eye so I'm pretty sure this isn't City Airport. What's going on? - Just business. Nothing to worry about. - Phones and bags. Everyone has to do it. You two, with me.

 What do you mean they didn't show up? - Air traffic control say they entered British airspace when they were supposed to. They they dropped off the radar. - Shit. Air traffic control got back to me. They say the plane was last picked up heading away from London. - Why change direction mid-flight? Pike and Bishop's communication. No check-ins. When we call it goes to voicemail. Shit. Jonesy, Munroe, get out there. Scope out their haunts, talk to their people. Paige, Scooch, we're gonna need to firm up Jodie now. Elena starts poking around Bishop's cover and then the boys disappear? I don't like it. We might need to back her into a corner and we need Jodie to do that. We'll try, ma'am. So, you really think she knows something? Let's see. Sarah Tanner. Long time. I'd say not much has changed but... that would be a lie. Elena. - I assume you're here to discharge me. You know, this is ridiculous. - Not so fast. Come on. You've got nothing. - We've got the right to question your client on any case of interest. - Fire away. We need to speak with your brother, Alex, and your son, Michael. Do you have any idea where they are? - No idea. When did you last speak to them? Come on, Sarah. Why don't you ask me what you really want to know? Make yourself comfortable. Yo. What's occurring? Dunno. You know how it is. Everything's on a 'need-to-know' only. Well, Mikey's cool, yeah? - Nah, not really. That's just Mikey, innit? You know what this family's like: properly dramatic. You all right, Tel? Mr Markides and Mikey are waiting in the study. Tyrone? - Yeah, that's me. He's asked for you to wait in the main living room with me. Dezzy, are you OK to take Andre to Mr Markides? No worries. Coffee? - Nah, I'm good. Andre. Take a seat. Alex. Michael. What's up? During our flight back, I received some worrying news about Tyrone. He's fucking... police. Tyrone? No way. - It's true. Brother's funny, man. If someone told me that my boy was a fed, I would be shook. You look calm as fuck. Is there anyone in the world who's not more calm than you? Who the fuck are you talking to?! - Mikey. I'm sure about this, Andre. How do I know isn't important. But how you didn't... is. Look, man, I don't know anything. Tyrone came out after ten years and asked me to get hooked up. I mean, come on, you trust me, right? Nah. Nah, nah, he fuckin' don't. Because is Tyrone is a fed... ...you are too. - If Tyrone is a fed, he played everyone. Uncle, why are you letting him chat all this shit? 'Cos Alex knows I would never lie to him. Isn't that right? Yeah, I know. But considering the circumstances, you understand we'll have to pacify my nephew. That's why you... ...are going to get rid of Tyrone. Yo. All right, listen. What's going on, man? What's happening? Are you police? What, are you a fed? - What are you doing? Are you a fed, Tyrone? Are you a fed?! - What's wrong with you? I told you he's a fed. - Think you can play me? Come on, man. - Why the fuck ain't he shot him yet? What you talking about? - What you got on us?! What you got on us?! - What are you talking about? Shoot him or I'm gonna shoot you. Let's be smart. We make the wrong choice now, we're fucked. Shut up and do it. Andre. All right. All right, we're police, you got us, what? Cool? - That hurt, you know. Sorry, man. Yeah, that's right, feds, you little bitch. What now? Hm? No hard feelings, eh? Just doing my job. From day one, I never liked you two. That's a lie. You loved us, bruv. - Yeah, you did, you little dick. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up... or your uncle's gonna get it. You think I'd give you a loaded gun? Listen. Listen, guys. Both of you just come quietly, yeah? Make a statement and we'll go easy on you. Yeah? - Fuckin' hell. I must be dreaming. Why the fuck would we come with you, Tyrone, Jerome, whatever the fuck your name is? There's police listening and watching everything we do. If you shoot us, you'll be in cuffs before you hit the ground. Oh, shit. Is it? Ohh. Do you hear that, uncle? They listening now, are they? Oi, little piggies? You better run in here now 'cos I'm about to splatter your officers' brains all over the wall. Wait, what's that sound? Yeah, it's more bullshit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Back up. Back up, back up. Just calm. You fuckin'... prick! Fuckin'... What? Enough! Not in here, Mikey. I don't want to leave any evidence. They need to disappear without a trace. Alex. Come on. Just doing my job. Paige. What's... what's going on? Jodie, I don't have much time. I need to know if you're gonna testify against Elena. What about not forcing me to do anything I didn't wanna do? Things have changed. People's lives are in danger. This is why I didn't wanna get involved. It's too dangerous. - My fellow officers... My friends. My friends are gonna die if you don't help me. Remember them? The ones who saved your life. OK, now it's your chance to return the favour. Please, Jodie. That's the fella. Darren Brownley. Works for Mikey. He's the manager, apparently. Has he got a rap sheet? Ooh, yeah. He's on parole for aggravated assault. Lovely. Let's go and get him, shall we? Hold up. We're gonna need a search warrant. Police. What do you want? - Want to know the whereabouts of Mikey Markides. I know you're gonna give it the whole, "I ain't no snitch, bruv" thing but I urge you to listen to my friend here first. Yeah. We're gonna search the place. Yeah? - Yeah. You got a... - Warrant? Yep. Now, according to your parole condition, if you're found with a weapon on or about your person, it's straight back to the bin for you. - I ain't got nothing on me. Oh, come on. You know that's now how this works. If we wanna find something, we just will. Mikey called from Cyprus. Said to keep the club open for when he got back. Something about celebration drinks. Well, obviously he's not turned up, so where did he go? Called to check in and he just said to close up. He's got business in the countryside, won't be back till lunch. That's it. - There we go. That wasn't so hard, was it? Thanks for your co-operation. Oh, yeah, um... Here. No way we're going out like this, bro. You got a plan? Got something you wanna say, bruv? Who told you to talk? Wait. I don't know who I'm more disappointed in... you... or me for being so stupid. We were going to run all of this properly. Together. Alex, you're more than this. I know you are. You... - I wanted to believe I could be. But... it's too late now. I'm sorry we couldn't live up to each other's expectations. On your knees, gentlemen. Don't get excited though. There's no happy ending. Right. This one's definitely mine. Say good night, pussy. - Wait, wait. Please, please, let's just think about this. Alex. Come on, man. I know you don't wanna do this. I know you don't. Mikey, man. He's got family, man. You got a family as well. Jarod. Come on. We've always had a special connection. Please, I don't wanna die. He's got a family. I always knew you were a little bitch. - Yeah? Argh! - Go! Argh! This way, come on! - Yeah? Go! Get them! What have we got? We're cross-referencing Markides' residences in the countryside... Yes, but have we actually found anything? No, sir, not yet. - Richard? Can I have a word, please? I don't appreciate your tone. We're doing our best. I warned you from the start to play things by the book. Ma'am. Jodie. Yo, we need to get to a main road before... - Yeah, I know, I know. Just give me a sec. You cool? - No, man. My ribs. - Come on, man. Move! Move! Go, go, go. Check down there. Down there. Yeah? - Yeah. Come on. OK, let's cut to the chase. My favourite part. I know that you've been in contact with Mikey and Alex. And I know why. Where are they? Not following. - If you tell me, I'll cut you a deal... which means you might not spend the rest of your life in a cell. We're leaving. Now. - Remember Jodie? A model from the agency you co-own. Mm? - Not ringing any bells, no. This is a live camera. Looks pretty good for a dead girl, doesn't she? We're ready, Scooch. Jodie, can you repeat what you told us before? About Elena. She covered up Leanne's death and made me lie about it. And are you prepared to testify against her in a court? Yes... ...I am. Elena, if Mikey and Alex do what I think they're planning on doing, there is no coming back for any of you, I promise you that. But if you help me, you stand a chance. This is a separate case. I'm gonna need a break to reconvene with my client. If Mikey goes too far, we will throw everything we've got at him. And there's a good chance he won't survive. What is it you want to know? They've taken a detour somewhere in the country. Narrow it down. Alex has a few places. The most discreet are near Carlisle and Norfolk. They're in his late wife's name and... ...he can fly straight to both of them. That's it. That's all I know. Thank you. Right. What have we got? - She's not lying. There's a country manor in both locations in his wife's name. Clever. - So two locations on either side of the country. You'll have to split up. We'll arrange backup at both locations. No, wait. The nightclub manager said Mikey would be back by lunchtime. Carlisle is six hours away. There's no way he'd plan to be back by then. So they must be in Norfolk. - This club manager could be lying. I trust Jonesy's instincts. We'll alert the Cumbrian police, but I want the unit over in Norfolk now. Good work. - Let's get on this. Do you wanna sort out that support? Are you good, bro? Listen, I can't keep up, man. - Yeah, what's new? Oh, bruv, I'm being serious. Them Markides could run up on us at any minute. So we handle them like we did before. That was luck, bro. - It might have been luck for you, man, but I wasn't even on a ten. Oh, Bish. - I was on an eight, eight and a half. Maybe even a seven. - Oh, Bish, Bish. Listen. Listen. If they catch up, yeah, and only you can get away, then just go, man. What? No. No way, man. What are you talking about? - Look, bruv, everything we've done, everything we've seen means nothing if we both die out here. And I ain't having that. Oh, man. Gee. Stop talking like that. Come on, let's go. - Bruv, listen to me. Let's be real. Aye? Only one of us has to make it out of here. And for the first time in your life, you're in better shape than me. All right, man. Come on, let's do it. - I'm being serious. Just promise me, yeah? If you have to leave me, just go, all right? Never. You done? Mm. Come on. - Easy. You can't just drag me. Stop moaning. Hey, you know, the trees are starting to thin out. You know what that means, right? - Yeah, we're getting close to a main road. We've got to move. - Should we go, left or right? Right, right, right. - Let's go left. What you asked me for? Arh! P? P. Pike. Haarh! Gun down. Don't look at me like that. - Like what? Like you brought two police officers into our family business? I worked with them. You basically adopted one of them. What have you told him? And what if we can't find them? Please. Move. Move. Ah! Where is the other one? - Couldn't find him. Let me dead him off, right here, right now. - You hear that? Uh? You hear that? The police are looking for us all. And if they catch us, we need something to bargain with. We have to work together now. But once we're out of here... - Mm-hm. ...I promise you you're finished. - Yeah. And when the time comes... ...I'll be the one to do it. Michael, go ahead. Make sure we can get out of here safely. I'll bring him. Dezzy. All right, guys, listen. Calm down, calm down. Get out of here or I'm gonna hurt you! I'm gonna call the police. - Call 'em. That's what I want you to do. Call 'em. Call 'em. - What? Wh... It's 999. It's simple. Just give me the phone. Yes, hello. This is Ronald Pike. Officer 100191. Please can you put me through to Branch Commander Sarah Tanner at the NCA, please? Pike. Thank God. Yeah, ma'am. Look, they got Bish and they know everything, yeah? Yeah, we know. The team are on their way. Where is Bishop? - I haven't got a clue. Probably back at the place they took us to a few hours ago. I'm trying to do something. No point me telling you to wait for backup, is there? Fuck no. - I didn't think so. Be careful, please. All right, ma'am. Course. Is that your car outside? Yes, yes. What sort of police are you then... exactly? Get me those. - Oh, they're family heirlooms. Open the cage now before I wrap this round your head and arrest you for fucking pissing me off. Quick! Yes. And those. Door. - Er... Key! Aye. Thank you very much. Really appreciate it, yeah? Yeah. Take it easy, mate. Where are they? You're police. You won't shoot. - Is that right? Today is not the day to test me, mate. Tell me or I'll blow your head off. Heading to the next petrol station. North on the motorway. Is my boy alive? I don't know. Give me your phone. Now. Quick! Come on. Hey, it's Scooch's phone. Leave a message. - Fuck! Scooch, it's Pike. Listen, get to the nearest petrol station north of the A11, all right? I think they might be switching cars. Hurry, we haven't got much time. Pull over here. I want a private word with Andre. You're stalling. You don't wanna do this, I know you don't. - You don't know what I want. Andre. What's your real name? Aaron Bishop. I know you wanna stop fighting and running and killing. You told me yourself. And yet still you betrayed me. After Stefan in Cyprus, I had to. It would have been better if you took me down... weeks ago... ...instead of getting close and humiliating me in front of my family. You made me feel like a fool. Alex, there's still time. I can still help you, I wanna help you. All you've done is lie to me! It wasn't all lies. I did grow up in the system. I could have gone down the wrong path but I made the right choice, like you can now. You are trying to stay alive. I can't lie. Not dying would be pretty cool right now. But I saw something in you. I did. You told me you didn't choose this life. But you can choose now. I really opened up to you, didn't I? Yeah. So... you should know... I'm never going to prison. Never. Come on. Move. Brandon was a better driver than you, Dezzy. - Shut up, man. No matter what your intentions were, you've still done a lot for me. I promise to make it quick. What happened to "one of us has to leave, no matter what"? What, you not happy to see me, no? So, what? Now we just have to both die together, yeah? Bruv, you know you can't do nothin' without me. Give me some ammo. - There. Come on, man. Police! What time you call this? - Better late than never. You OK? Yeah, good. You? - Yeah. Give me more. I'm not fuckin' letting them go. - Mikey! Arh! - You fool! You f... What's going on? - Get out of the way! You ready? - Yeah. Go on. That's our car definitely out. - Yeah, so's ours. Don't worry. We've got the whole area cordoned off. They won't get far. Come on, move it, fella. Bruv... ...my guy was in love with you so much, he never expected you to keep that murder weapon, did he? I know, man. Just shows me, I guess I did a good job. Very good job, bruv. Ever since you took me to that fuckin' private members' club. I did tell you it was gonna be big though, didn't I? Yeah, man. You did. You didn't do too bad yourself. Came back and rescued me all on your own. - Appreciate that. I did all right. - Yeah, you did all right. Nah, you did better than all right. When I saw you in action it was like... the A-Team, it was like you were Pike-us Baracus. - Yeah. Kaah! - Oi! Yo, yo! Oh, sorry. Sorry. I forgot he kicked you. - You know my ribs are hurting me. Yeah, sorry. So, you reckon that's it then? We did it. Yep. Once they connect this to Stefan's murder, Alex is done. You boys find what you were looking for? - Yeah, man. Bag it. - Nice one. Let's get you two cleaned up, yeah? I mean, you've looked better. And, to be honest, you don't smell that great. You try being dragged through the countryside, through manure and all that. - I'm not judging. Just had the car cleaned. Don't want you stinking it up. You're judging. - Yeah. You smell. - I smell? Have you smelt yourself? Lift up your arm and smell your own armpit. I never smell. The state of you. - I never smell. Yeah, ma'am, it's me. I heard you've been a bit stressed and depressed. But never fear, your favourite two team members are on their way back. Your brush with death hasn't stopped you from being an annoying little shit. I think it's made him worse, to be honest. - Well, I'm glad you're back. Whoa. Does that mean they are actually your favourite? I hate you all equally. What's the latest on our favourite drug-trafficking murderers? Nothing. - You come home. And that's an order. Well done. You did great. You heard her. Rest and recovery. We need a few more of them. - Get them in. Get down, get down! Is everyone all right? - Yeah, I'm good. Me too. You all right, Jonesy? He's been shot. We need to get out there now. You lot, stay low. Call in. I need backup right away. Fuck off! Yo! Come! Jonesy! What's happening? - Mikey got away. I um... I can't stop the bleeding. There's backup and ambulance on the way. Come on, bro. Don't let them win, man. Don't let them win, OK? You got this, Jonesy. Come on, man. Um... there's first-aid kits in the car outside, so let's go and get them. Munroe. - What are you waiting for?! Come on, Jonesy, man. Come on, Jonesy. Jonesy. - Munroe. He's fine. He's good. - Munroe. Chris. He's gone, man. Still no sign of Mikey? No, but we've um... we've widened our search, so... Right, well, we need to know everything and soon. It will help with figuring out their next move. - What is your problem? We just lost a fucking officer. What, you can't give us five minutes? I told you this guy was a dickhead. - OK. OK. Just give us a minute, yeah? - Yeah. Are you OK? I'm out of here. I've got him. No, we had 'em. We had 'em, ma'am, and then they just... they just slipped away. And they killed one of our team and it's... it's like we failed, you know. No, listen. Come here, come here, come here, come here. You did more than anyone could ask for, OK? Both of you. It's our duty to do whatever we can to get the Markides now. Ali's in trouble. I need your help.
