 We"re off the Sharp case due to negligence. You had Sharp in your custody and now he"s dead. Listen to me, Barton. Help me and I"ll help you. The weapons we used on the work... I know the supplier. Barton"s dead. My contacts tell me he had his throat cut in the shower. Sir. Sir. It was my decision to go and see Barton. Yet Ms Tanner authorised it?

 I just thought, under the circumstances... Only because I pressurised her. This is what happens when rules get broken - when officers disregard the law... and their duty. You were told you were off the Sharp investigation. I didn"t cause Barton's murder. You disobeyed a direct order. There was a robbery. Three men that did it are dead. Sharp"s killer shot 'em. He"s covering his tracks. Barton was the next on the list. For all you know, your prison visit put him on that list - if there is a list, which you also don"t know. You don"t know anything. Which is precisely why your unit was taken off the Sharp case.

 Misjudgement, failure, incompetence. If you"d just let us do our job, then we... Without my support, you wouldn"t have a job at all. You"d be in front of a disciplinary board, answering charges of gross professional misconduct. Which is why Ms Tanner authorised you, and not Bishop, to visit Barton. She knew that if anything went awry that I would step in to protect my son"s career - and, by extension, her own. Your mother never wanted you to come into law enforcement. Maybe she knew you weren"t up to it. I will not have you ruin my reputation. This is the last time I intervene on your behalf. - I can live with that. - Sir. I can live with that, sir. - Yo, man, how did it go? - Bad. - That wasn"t fair, Pike. - Man doesn"t do fair. For the record, it was Director Pike that took us off the Sharp case. Against my advice and better judgment. I"m never gonna get an exec level promotion. Do you know why? Cos I"m not a massive twat. How you doing, bro? You seem pretty relaxed about everything. Put your weight on your left foot... - Bastard! - Who, him or your dad? If it"s your dad, I've been thinking that for a while. I"m an embarrassment, innit? A stain on his reputation he wants to get rid of. He should look in a mirror, if he"s embarrassed. It"s not like it's nothing new, is it? One more screw-up... and I"m out. So what"s the solution, bro? - We don"t screw up, do we? - Exactly! Psst. Yo. Yo. Question. If you guys were looking for a Luger, where would you start? A Luger? A P08? Yeah. Yeah, that kind of thing, yeah. The same one used by your friend "Ray" to murder Darren Brown, Curtis Cox and Michael Sharp? But a different one. So, not the gun we"ve been ordered not to go after? Yes. Not that one. Nellios... You worked in Trojan for a lot of years. You"ll know better than anyone. For me? OK, listen. It was Director Pike that took us off the case, not Tanner. Jonesy"s back this afternoon and you"re the only one who hasn"t signed. That"s cos I don't like Jonesy. That"s why I haven't signed. This how you spell Jonesy, right? So? If you wanted a silencer too, I have a list of suspect dealers. And their addresses? - No. - Thanks. This is a joke. I signed up for the glamour. No, you didn"t. You signed up because your dad forced you. Oh, man. My sneaks, bruv! This is just London. Sharp"s killer could've got the gun from anywhere. No, no, see, I research these places. Your problem is you"re not as meticulous as me. - You"re the problem, mate. - Why? Where do you keep your dirty boxers? Tell me. Bro, I thought that was the laundry basket. Yeah, well, it"s Donna's dressing-up box! Sorry. Getting a flat soon. Shut up, man. You think I"m scared of you? Leave it, before we put some laxative in your... - He"s barking at you, you know. - Whatever, man. Oh, shut up, that dog. Afternoon, lads. What"s up? Not much, you know. How can I help you chaps? We wanna buy a piece. - Sorry, a what? - A fucking nine, bruv! You know, a gun? You think I come here to scrap my car? Don"t know what you"re talking about. You don"t want to sell us a gun? All right, we"ll take it, then. Get fucked. Argh! Fuck! Where are the guns, man? Where are they? The money"s in there! It"s just a couple of hundred. It"s all I've got. Please! I"m talking about guns, not money. See the badge? See the badge? Yes, I fucking see the badge! Then you don"t mind if we have a look around? Good lad. I don"t even wanna touch anything in here, to be fair. Disgusting shit. This place is a waste of our time. It"s nasty, innit? - Nothing? - Nothing in there, man. - See? I told you. - Shut up. Take a cigarette if you don"t mind. Yeah, help yourself. - Do you want one? - I don"t smoke. Let"s hope we have better luck with the next one on the list. - Where"s it at? - Just out past Hornchurch. About two miles on the... What the...? Yo. Yo. Yeah. Come on, man, move! Reverse! Come on! Reverse! - This guy, man? - Move the car, man! He wants you to reverse. - Don"t reverse. - I"m not reversing. Polizia. Polizia. He"ll move now. Oh, man. - Stalling now, yeah? - Mm. What"s this guy even doing here, anyway? Don"t look like he"s stalling to me. It looks like he"s panicking. - Wanna go and talk to him? - Yeah, we probably should. No, don"t bother. Stop wasting your time. Window. - OK? - We in your way, man? No, no. Sorry, it"s my fault. I should be more... less impatient. True. - Hey, Bish! - Yo. What"s the legal tyre depth? I believe the legal tyre depth is 1.6mm. These are looking a bit bald to me. Ooh. Problems. Mind stepping out of the car, please, sir? Whereabouts you keep your insurance documents, mate? In the front of the car, maybe. Maybe? Shall we have a look? I"m hoping it's more than a "maybe", cos you know you need your V5C to scrap this. I mean, that"s why you're here, right, to scrap the car? Hm? What have you got in your boot? Excuse me, sir, I"m talking to you. Can you open the boot, please? Open the boot, man. No. - What was that? - The man said no, innit. It"s all right. Well... I mean, I know we can"t open it. But I"ve heard these cars have a tendency for the boot to pop open accidentally. I know. I"ve heard that. - Oh, my gosh. - Wow! Get up. Bruv, call this in. She... She"s my daughter. I am arresting you on suspicion of murder. You do not have to say anything... Resuming interview with asylum seeker Bakur Nezan to ascertain the circumstances of his daughter"s death. I vowed to do what I could to make a better life for Dila. I trusted those traffickers. I understand, believe me. You have a daughter? Look, we can"t release her body yet, but we will treat her with care. And she"s gonna help us find the men that did this. We hope you understand that we will need to run some identification checks on both of you. What was she like? She loved trucks. Big ones. When she knew that"s how we coming to England, she was so excited. Here. Where"s the rest of your family? My wife... was killed in an air raid, with my son. Where did these traffickers take you when you got to the UK? It was a place with many buildings. They took us to one with a locked door. Me and Dila, we were the last. They came when we were sleeping and took her. They took your girl? They stole her from me. It took me a day and a night to break out of that building. In front of the building, I found the car. In the car was my precious daughter. What were you doing at his yard? I went there to buy a gun. To kill the people who did this. And then myself. It"s great. Huge. It"s got this... amazing view. I"ll send you photos. Nah, nah, I"d prefer to see it in person, babe. You OK, baby? Yeah, yeah, I"m good. I"m just having a really tough day and I... I just wanted to hear your voice. That"s all. I"ve got to go. Love you. - Love you. - OK. You"ve never mentioned this before. I wasn"t sure I could get it off the ground. Which is where I come in? - Which is where you come in. - OK. Look, the site is ready, the plans are done, the keys are in the digger. All I need is for the S106 to be signed off and it"s a go. OK, so what sort of time frame are we playing with here? Oh, you know me - yesterday. Of course. Look, I want this development to be part of my legacy. 1,500 social housing units. And just imagine having that up my sleeve when I make my run for Mayor. Oh. Yeah, I know. But look... First female Mayor of London has got a nice ring to it. Yeah. Yeah, it really does. As long as you don"t bring out shoulder pads, we"ll be fine. Look, erm... Do me a favour, just take a look at it, let me know what you think. Hello. Yes. Yeah, OK. I"ll be there. He says that he and his daughter are Kurds, escaping persecution from Syria. He"s claiming asylum. - Where were they brought in? - He has no idea. Look, I say we get him one. We could take this. Uncovering a people-smuggling ring sounds like a good use of your time. Christ knows we could do with a result right now. Ma"am? Bakur was looking for a gun at the breaker"s yard. We think that killer Ray got his from there. I don"t want to hear. - When you say don"t want to... - We"re off the Sharp case. Get out. Listen, man. If Bakur went there to get a gun, we may have been right about Ray"s stash the whole time. We"ll trace the gun. Yeah? Let"s just concentrate on a man that"s lost his daughter now. That my new call sign, is it? Fuckface? Nothing new about it. Been calling you a lot worse for a lot longer. If you"re gonna hit me, mate, let"s not do it here. We both like this job. I can"t help how I feel, and neither can Soph. You know what, man? I hope you make a go of it and I wish you all the best. Thanks, mate. I trust my friends. You got a long way to go before that ever happens. I"m sorry, Jonesy. But now we"re all square, yeah? Let"s get the ball rolling, man. I know you got my back and everything but in public like that? Damn. - It was needed. - Yeah, you"re right! Fuck him! She was actually a remarkably healthy young girl. Which is undoubtedly why they chose her. If you look here, there"s a second incision... like that on the left side. A rib has also been removed. What for? To facilitate organ removal. Both kidneys were taken, by someone with medical training. She was alive when they operated. Unconscious, but alive. The kidneys are in better condition that way, improving the chances of a successful transplant. Thank you. Pike? You all right? - Yeah. - Good. That was a bit rough still, man. How do we tell him, bro? - How can we tell him? - Mm. All I could see was Ali lying there. It doesn"t feel right. What doesn"t? Bruv, we"re Feds... This is my job. But in there, I was a dad. Listen, I"ll tell him. Don"t worry about it. Bro... It has to be me. Oh, no. - Sorry. - It"s OK. I understand. I have two daughters... Ali and Donna. I failed mine. I failed my daughter. I am not a father. He"s broken. You really think he"s gonna help you bring down a smuggling ring? Bakur, listen to me. You don"t fail... if you don't let them get away with this. Help me find these men. I would give my life to find them... and I tried. But where do you look? I don"t know. No. Don"t tell me what you don't know. Tell me what you do. So, they concealed you in the truck in Southern Italy? Yeah. When the truck stopped at the docks, did you hear any other cars parking around you, or was your container lifted up? Lifted. It was lifted up. What is the most likely exit port in Southern Italy? Er... UK-Italy, it"s gonna be Venice or Genoa. - How long were you at sea? - Seven days. Maybe eight. - Genoa MUNROE: Genoa. OK, I need a list of Europol"s top traffickers and smugglers - coming out of Genoa. - OK, on it. So, when the container drove out of the docks, did you hear a steady rumble, the truck driving straight? A motorway, you mean? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, but not for long. 20 minutes, maybe. OK. They have got to have come in here. These are most likely, according to Europol. So plenty to choose from. So he spends two to three hours driving around the city with his daughter in the back of the car but he never leaves it. - That"s a radius. - Yeah, a big one. Well, narrow it down! - Any luck on the plates? - Nah, fake, as you"d expect. Do you remember any particular landmarks? No. What about signs? - Names of businesses? - Oh, no, I"m sorry. The colour of the door, for instance? Anything. I don"t know. There was a... There was a tower... a big brick chimney. Yeah? I don"t remember. I just wanted my daughter. Oh, man, look. It"s OK. - I"m sorry. - It"s OK. All right, let"s leave it there for tonight. - Oh, he"s here, man. - Fuck me. Dawn Of The Dead, yeah? Yeah, something like that. You good? Yeah, man, cool. What happened to you last night? Well, you know... Just.. What? That social worker thing? No, man, she was not a thing. Suspects for Bakur to look at. Oh, thank you. Cheers. - Why you talking my business? - I"m saying did you beat? - No, of course I didn"t. - Are you sure? That"s him. When did you see him? When they took us from the truck to the locked building. This is the man I"m looking for. Not you. Me. You all right? - Yeah. - Good. So, I"ve sorted you a hostel for tonight. Nothing fancy but it"s clean. Oh... - For you. - Ah. Take care. You will... will find him? Gazim Dushku, aka "Sergio Roshi" and probably more besides. He"s on Europol's database but we haven"t seen him here before. He"s Albanian, top guy in a crew that usually deals with people trafficking and smuggling. They"ve been running the European routes for years. It looks like the UK"s new business. Bring him in, gold stars till Christmas. Here, here, and here - light industrial parks within 50 minutes of the docks, none more than a 25-minute stretch on a dual carriageway. But look at this one... Colour of the door, for instance? - Anything. - I don"t know. There was a... There was a tower, a big brick chimney. You know what? I fucking love you. - Nell deserves applause. - It"s on. Europol have been tracking a container linked to Gazim"s gang, shipping out of Rotterdam. - It"s due in here now. - Let"s go. Pike for Nell. We"re in position. There he is. We see Gazim. I repeat, we have eyes on Gazim. - What"s your ETA? - Closing in. ETA 50 seconds. Rear"s secure. They ain't getting out this way. Remember, there"s people in that container. Let"s not shoot the people we"re here to protect. - Jesus, that"s an old woman. - Some fucked-up shit. Ready to nail this motherfucker. - I count 15 civilians. - 20 seconds out. Making final approach on York Way. No. No, that"s gonna lead you right out front. For fuck"s sake! - Fucking idiots, man! - Drop your weapon! Stop! Shit! Get out! Pike! Pike! Come here! Fuck! Fucker! - Yaargh! - What"s wrong with you? What"s wrong with you? What are you doing? He fucking killed a kid! And you"re gonna leave yours without a dad? What the fuck do you know? You don"t have fucking kids! - Fuck you! - Hey, bro, relax, man. Bro, come on, man. Come on! Just cool down, man. Stay there, man. Fuck! This guy pepper-sprayed you good and proper. Hold still. - W... - Ohh! What are you doing? - You flinched. - You"re putting shit in my eye! - Are you finished? - Yeah. Go on, just do it. Do the other eye. But just do... Just... Just hold still. OK. Go on, then, do it. - Done. - Ah. - Good? - Yeah, thanks. You are a rubbish patient. You know that? Doctor"s rubbish bedside manner, more like. What was he doing, Bish? I don"t know. Fallen out with your boyfriend? Please. - I don"t know. - What about your girlfriend? - What girlfriend? - Social worker? - What? - Netflix and chill? Listen, that was all flix and no chill, trust me. You know. We just got there and the next thing I remember, I woke up with all my clothes on. Nothing happened. Do I believe you? I wouldn"t lie to you. See you upstairs. Mm. Eat more. Please. I know why you did this and I thank you. You didn"t need to. Hello, lovelies. Babe, you"ll never guess what Charlotte told me today. She"s running for Mayor... Oh. Hi. - Hi, Mummy. - Hi, baby. - Sorry... - This is Bakur. And I was taking him to a hostel. Bakur"s an asylum seeker. Were you really smuggled here? Oh. Yeah. I must go. - Not because of me, I hope? - I must. Please, stay. You"re welcome. Oh, er... Um... you ready, yeah? - Yeah. - See you, babe. Nice. I"ll ask Arjana to find someone who specialises in asylum applications. I... don"t have the words to express how much I appreciate what you"ve done for me. You"re a good man who did his best for his family. Family"s all that matters. Look after yours, my friend. Your girls are very special. Take care. In case you were wondering, I didn"t ask Pike to punch you, but I"m glad he did. Come on, man. I know you guys can"t jump. I didn"t know you couldn"t climb either. Left foot, left foot! Explain again what I"m doing here. This guy says he doesn"t deal in guns. An illegal immigrant said he came here to get a gun. I think that"s worth checking out. I definitely think this guy provided Ray with the gun that killed Sharp. Yeah, but... why me? This is a highly-sensitive... borderline gross misconduct reconnaissance we"re on and whoever led the way into here would get in some serious trouble. Oh! Watch out for the dog, man. Whoa, easy, easy, yeah. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. You stay here. You stay here. - What? - You stay here. Psst! He"s left his door open. See? Ohh. See, this is the problem. Pike never fucking looks anywhere properly. Found a load of guns, man. I"m gonna call it in. What can I say? They like me. Why does that not surprise me? After you. I"m not gonna let you go behind me, am I? Fuck. Shall I call it in? Yeah. Call it in. Yo. Oh. All right? What happened to you last night? Listen, man, I need to talk to you about it. Don"t ask me how I know but scrapyard guy was a gun dealer - and when I was at... - We"ll talk after the kids go. - Yeah, yeah. - Find your shoes. Come on! - Dad, where are they? - They"re your shoes. You have to look for them. Come off your phone, please. - I"ve told you already. - Hey. I can take Ali to school, if it"s easier. You can just deal with Donna. - Yeah? - That"s what uncles are for. - All right. Off your phone. - All right. If I knew you was making chicken, I would have come. - Don"t touch that. - It was for Bakur. He came for dinner last night. Oh, come on, man. The man just lost his family, innit? It"s the least I could do. - Well, I don"t like him. - He doesn"t like you either. - Can you get off your phone? - Get off your phone! Where"s your bag? This one? Get out. Get on. Hey, take your time, man. I"ll be 10 minutes. 15. Are you jealous you"re being replaced by Bakur? No. Don"t be silly. I just don't see why it"s acceptable that he brings any Tom, Dick and Aziz back for tea and biscuits. He didn"t stay. Don't worry. You still have Donna"s room. I"m getting my own place soon. With your girlfriend, the social worker? Hey. For the record, nothing happened, all right? That cos you"re still into Sophie? You see you, yeah... Listen. You, you"re little people. That big people business, you understand me? All right? - All right? - Yes! - What do you mean "Yes"? - I won the game. Just here. - What? - Here"s good. - What do you mean here? - Here"s good. - Right here? Sure? - Yeah, here"s fine. I'm sure. Are you sure, yeah? Who"s that boy there? - I don"t really... - Bye! Bye! OK. Have a nice day. OK, learn... learn things... Bye. How is that kid 12 years old? I don"t get it. Hey, Nell, how"s it going? I"m tracking private purchases of medical equipment used in organ transplants. Good. Gazim"s happy to cough up for people smuggling. Flatly denies organ harvesting. Outraged by the very idea of it. Yeah, of course. He reckons it"s a setup by his rival. So, when you"ve got a minute, check out this name. Sercan Kubat. - Sercan Kubat. Got it. Kam? - Yo. Sercan Kubat. You been getting my messages? Scrapyard guy is dead. - Double tap head shot... - Mate, listen. Ali"s school just sent me a text to say she"s absent. - You did drop her off, right? - Yeah, of course I did. What, at the gates? You saw her go in? - Well, yeah. She must be there. - Hold on. Got a call coming. Oh, it"s her. Listen, little girl, if you"re bunking lessons, I"ll... Bishop! Sit down. You OK? She"s fine. Unless you"ve brought your friends. Who are you? As your friends will discover, if they haven"t already... my name is Sercan Kubat. I traffic in this and that. Organs, when the price is right. And, believe me, a financier whose child needs a kidney will pay a very great deal of money. And my associates and I have no issues providing them. Dila wasn"t your daughter. My daughter died two years ago with the rest of my family. - Air raid. - Bullshit. The more truth is in the lie, the more believable it is. He"s not picking up. - What"s his location? - Phone"s offline. GPS is dead. - OK, try his daughter Ali. - What"s she got to do with it? Just try her! - Talk to me! - All right. I"m searching. Right, it"s a café on North Street. - I"ll send the co-ordinates. - Got it. Oh, fuck, man. Listen to me, baby. It"s all right, OK? I promise. Your colleagues will be looking for me. You must divert them. Otherwise, I"ll find your family and kill them while you watch. I know where your house is. I know where your wife works, where your children go to school. And so do my associates. Arrest me, and my people will find them. They are safe... as long as I"m safe. Do you understand? Yes. We"ll never see each other again. I"m so sorry. Hey! Hey, stop! Don"t run, you little... Oi, Bish! Bish! Oi, Bish! No! No! Bish! Bish, man. Bish, no! - What"s wrong with you? - We have to let him go! - You don"t understand! - He played you for a fool! You let him in your fucking house! Who do you think you"re talking to? What the fuck? What the hell is wrong with you? Sorry, baby. I need you to tell me where Bakur is. Think Pike will forgive you if you deliver his head on a plate? Is Bakur really coming to kill us? You did act like a father, and not a cop. Take the kids upstairs. I"m going outside. There"s someone out there. You need to know the truth... before you sign your life away.
