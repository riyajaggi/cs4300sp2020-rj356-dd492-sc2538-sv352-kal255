You need some love. Bro, I'm being really serious with you, I'm not in the fuckin' mood. All right, come on, make it quick. C'mon. Bro, don't put your hand on me again. What? What the fuck was that? Was that quick enough for you, yeah? What? What?! Hey, he's with me. Fuck you, man! Get the fuck out of my face. Watch your back, wena. What, you think I owe you something? Hey, don't flatter yourself, man. I was trying to get him off your back. Why? I don't like bullies. I run this block, just remember that. Hello, my friend. Are you the guy with that ruby heist crew? You're the man. I heard they were running with some London boys. The three of you really fucked it up, didn't you? Three of us? Yes. One of your boys right now in the infirmary with a gunshot wound. Yeah, he is bad. Mmm.Mmm. Look here. Why don't you tell us where the rubies are, my bro? Why don't you... Uh... ...learn... Uh... ...to brush your fuckin' teeth. He's got heart. I like that. You got a fuckin' blade, man. Come this way. Let's go, cheeseburger. D'you know what this is? This is my accreditation card from the British Board of Solicitors. That means I know you have no right to keep my husband in prison without charge. And that means I'm not leaving this station until you abide by the letter of the law. Is that clear? Different country, different law, Miss...? Bullshit. We'll see about that. How would you describe your home life? Home life? What's that got to do with my daughter being kidnapped? No, I'm just trying to build a picture here, you know? How are things between you and your wife? My wife? Mm-hmm. What are you playing at? Why are you sitting here asking me questions about my wife when you should be looking for my daughter! Do you often lose your cool like this? I mean it is understandable. Listen, sir, do me a favour. Why don't you get out there and go find my daughter, please? OK? Enough questions. Go find my daughter. I'm sorry, we can't let your husband go until we've fully ascertained his involvement in this. In the meantime, we've got people out there looking for Kayla as we speak. What are you trying to say? Cos he won't tell me anything. Will you find Kayla? Like I said, we deal a lot with these type of cases. Trust us, we know what we're doing. And the last kidnap you dealt with, did the victim come home alive? OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. I promise you that won't be the case this time. Trust me. Are you OK? Can I sit here? Bro. Thanks for looking out for me last night. No problem. So tell me, bro, what are you in for? I'm innocent. So was I until they caught me running guns in my kassie. Your what? My kassie, Langa. My home. Damian Nkusi. Yes, Chief. Grab your stuff. You're being released. Being released, yeah? Yeah, bro. Hey, man, look me up if you ever step foot in Langa. Just ask for Nkusi. Everyone knows me. Oh, and remember. Watch your back, bro, without me to protect you. I heard they fucked up a new inmate in Block H last night. Just make sure you're not next. Hey, yo, Bish. Bish. How you goin', P? I thought you were dead. No, man, I'm good. Are you sure? Yeah. Listen, I don't know how we got ourselves here, but this place is like a zoo. I know. Plus, that little girl's probably dead by now. I wouldn't be so sure. I wouldn't be so sure. We've got no way of finding out, bro. Hey, pretty boy. What? Now listen. We do have a way of finding out. One of the guys from the van is laid up in the infirmary. Yeah, but, bruv, we're in prison. We can't just walk to the infirmary and start asking him questions. Bro, I've got a plan. Now you're gonna cut me - deep. OK? Draw blood. Come. Where's the girl? I said where's the girl? You're hurting me! I don't know anything, man. Stop! Hmm? I don't know anything. My cousin Jo brought me in as the driver, they never said anything! Shh... So why did you kill Jo? Jo's dead? You bastard. You killed him. You killed him, didn't you? You killed my cousin, you bastard! Now you listen to me. You listen to me. If you don't wanna end up the same way as Joe, you're gonna help me, OK? OK? Started talking. OK. We used a fixer. He hooked us up with guns, with cars and everything. He's going to know more. You're going to ask him. What's the fixer's address? A township just off Settlers Way. Exit 15. Now stop. OK, OK, cool, man. Oh, sorry. Hold on. Lekker, man. Lekker. I'm really sorry about your cousin. I'm coming for you, pretty boy. You think it's gonna be that easy, yeah? He's mine! Yo! Can't I leave you anywhere for two minutes? Where the fuck were you? I'm here. Everyone, on the floor! Down on you knees! Down! I think we might be in a bit of trouble here, you know? Nah, man. There's loads of inmates here. There's no way they're gonna single us out. Aaron Bishop! Ronald Pike! Come with us. Let's go. - Stay on the ground. - Yeah! Stay on the ground. Fuck you very much. Suck your mum! Broski, we're getting out. Bro, those guys are gonna be really angry if we have to go back in there. Oh, hold on. Is that why you told them to "suck their mum"? I thought we were getting out. Well, we're not. Boss, listen, we're British police. Save it. Oh! Fuckin' hell, boys. You look like shit! Ma'am, thanks for flying over. Come here. Oh! Oh. It's good to see you, ma'am. Oh, my God. Come on, let's get you out. Are we getting out? Yes, now. Come on. Go on. Yeah, we are getting out. The kidnapped girl is Kayla Sincadu, and unfortunately for us, because we were kept in the dark for so long, this case now is headline news. This year alone there's been a 20% increase in kidnapping, and not all of them have had a happy ending. So I want you guys to make sure that this one does. - All of you. - Yes, sir. Right, so we'll be assisted by our British colleagues. Obviously they have an intimate knowledge of the case. But they'll be observing only. Right. This remains our baby. So, let's get to it, guys. You guys, start playing by the rules. This is not London. All right, Uncle Phil. Cool down, man. What did you call me? Bish, eh? Look after them. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. He's grumpy, isn't he? Yeah. Sorry about the chief there. So, listen, I had a really true conversation with that Baako kid in jail yesterday. And he mentioned the fixer that they used in the DeKroos heist. Said he's based around Settlers Way, exit 15. OK, that narrows it down to Bridgetown, Silvertown, Langa, half a dozen other townships. I don't know what to tell you, I don't live here. It's a good lead. We'll look into it. OK. Let's just keep it between us for now, you know, avoiding unnecessary leaks. You guys scope it up, as soon as you find anything let me know. I'd like to go back to the crime scene where the first body was recovered. Are you suggesting you'll find something we didn't? No, I'm suggesting that killers make mistakes. I just think it's worth another look. I think you're right, ma'am. Sure. I'll escort you. Let me just get my keys. Yeah, great. And you two, you need to get changed first cos you stink. That's him. Yeah. What are you thinking? I know you're thinking something. Local knowledge. It might be nothing. I'll explain on the way. What's wrong? I was always worried that I wouldn't be a good mum. Why? Cos I remember when I was pregnant, and I was thinking, "I don't want this." I've not really... Maybe I was right. You can't blame yourself for what's happened. We both lost sight of the children for a few seconds. It's not your fault. It is my fault. Like we all have doubts. Lord knows, I have. Really? Yeah. OK? The body was found just there, face down on the floor. Do you mind if we do a bit of role-play? Miss Turner, we've only just met. I'm gonna be the victim and you're the killer. OK, so... OK. Yeah, two shots that we know of. The first went through the victim, lodged in the window frame, the killer dug it out. The other shot grazed the victim, but it must've gone out the window. We assume it was open. We searched the street and didn't find anything. That thing's gone. What if the actual bullet never left this room? What do you mean? Well, what if it hit this bar and... ricocheted off of it? Yeah. Here it is. Jeez, Miss Tanner, they told me you were good, they didn't say you were Sherlock Holmes. Right. I'll get ballistics on to this. Huh. Hey. I was just looking for Megan. She's not in here. Mm-hmm. And you're in my office. William, is that you? They've released you. Oh, thank God you're back. Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah. They're done questioning me. And your husband's boss from the UK has just verified their credentials. Mm, I knew Sarah would come through. Yeah. So they're being released. And Kayla? Hmm? Yeah, they're hopeful. Oh! Oh, thank goodness. Thank goodness. OK, I'll leave you to it. Thank you. We'll find her. Thank you. Arjana. Ah. Oh, baby. Oh, my gosh, are you OK? Of course I'm OK. Mmm. I thought I was gonna lose you in there. Never. That was a walk in the park, baby. How are the girls? Yeah, they're good. They're playing outside.Good. I just came back from Megan and William's. Something's not right about him. William, I mean. What do you think? I think you should just stop worrying about other people's marriage.Yeah. And focus on us. Mmm. Like that pregnancy test. What you saying? Yeah? What's up? What's going on? What's wrong? Talk to me. I'm not sure if I'm ready for another child. Of course we are. We? Ron, remember, I'm the one that has to stay at home and look after the girls. I'm the one that has to go on maternity each time. You know I'm a partner now. I can't afford to take time off. I know what you're saying. Look, I promise you I'm gonna be there this time. Yeah? That's what you always say. Are you gonna be off on some case somewhere? Slipping in in the middle of the night? I can't do this on my own. So what are you saying? Cos to me it already sounds like you've made the decision, like... Huh. I just... We don't talk to each other about things... This is why I'm talking to you right now. That's cool, that's cool. Babe, come on. Ron. Sit down. Let's... Let's have an adult conversation, please? You haven't even got your top on. Yo! What? Come on, man, let's go. You know, you're a rare breed down here, Miss Tanner. We don't have many women in positions of power on the force. Especially not attractive ones. Oh, I don't really know how to interpret that. You could always return the compliment. This place, it's difficult, isn't it? Inequality runs deep here. I mean, look at me. I'm a decorated officer, I can't even afford to move out of the house my parents lived in. Yeah, but at least you're rich in character. Huh! Yeah? OK. On my way. Yet another sighting.Great. Mmm. That'll be the tenth today. Oh. I'll check it out. Drop you off on the way? Yeah, lovely. Thanks. Hey, do you want to have dinner later? I'd like to show you the nice side of Cape Town. I promise you we have one. Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Lovely. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. If we ever get there. Come on! Bro, this is exit 15, man. Langa. Let's hope my guy Nkusi knows this fixer. Yo. Excuse me, I wondered if you could - Haisuka wena. Guys, I wonder if you can help me? I'm looking for a guy named Damian Nkusi. He's about this high. What car have you got there? Ferrari. Ferrari? Yeah? Ferrari! OK, yes, Ferrari. Buy me a Ferrari. Yo. Yo. Find anything out? Nothing. There's me thinking for once you actually knew what you were doing. Local knowledge. Listen. I'm trying my best, bro. Why are you taking that tone with me, Ronald? I'm not taking that tone, and don't call me Ronald, brother, I don't like it. It's on your birth certificate. Bruv, listen, man. Listen, stop going on about the same thing. I'm doing what I'm meant to be doing, you do what you're meant to be doing. What are you talking about? What? What? What? We're being followed. What? We are being followed. Red T-shirt. What do you say, man? What do you wanna do? Go! All right, c'mon. Bish! Bish! Sorry. Sorry. Bish, run! Go! Shit! Come on... This your guy? Hamba. Hamba? Hamba. Yeah, you heard, Movado... Hamba. Fuck. I am so happy to see you, my friend. Brother.Bless. What's up? We need a favour. We're looking for a fixer who lives in your hood. We'll pay. No. I need more than just money. No way! Bish! No. No way! This is the... this is the second pair. I know. Those the ones with the Velcro? Where's the girl? Where's the girl? She's safe. You take me to her right now. Really? What the fuck are you doing? Improvising. You need to tighten up your security, buddy. I walked right in. I could've been anyone. Just take me to her. You need to calm down, bro. Get the girl, swap for rubies. You said this would be easy. In, out. Fuck all about British cops being on our tail. I am dealing with them, just like I dealt with Jo, that was your mess. Shut up! Bring us the rest of the rubies, you'll get your cut when we sell them. Hey... Come on. You've got enough rubies. Sell them, man. Let's end this thing. Don't take me for a Gat. Bring us what we're owed or the girl dies... and this all falls back on you, officer. Thanks for coming over, Arjana. I'd like your opinion on something. According to this report, five years ago a neighbour reported a domestic disturbance at William and Megan's house. And in Williams statement he said... he said that she fell down a flight of stairs. Huh. Well, that's funny, because in Megan's statement she claims she slipped and fell in the shower. And that's how she dislocated her shoulder. I'll talk to her. This is all I've got right now. But I'm telling you, none of this is gonna get past that guy's security. Nah, I wouldn't be so sure about that, my man.Hmm. I think you got exactly what we need. The rest is up to you now. Thank you. No hard feelings, bro. I don't know why you paid him when he took my trainers, bruv. It's done. Deal with it.That... That wasn't the deal. Pass. He is so angry. Go on. No shoes on the zebra skin, please, I've just had it cleaned. Zebra? I preferred him alive to be honest. How can I help you gentleman? Listen, I am gonna cut to the chase, yeah. We're British police and we're looking for that missing girl. The DeKroos heist, you remember that? Hey. Yo. We're not here to arrest you, we just want maybe a little bit of information that could help, y'know? Police? We are the police around here. You're just two dead men walking. Dead men walking. Nice gun. Bish, do you want to get the door? Yeah, man, I'll get it. What are you doing? One thing that unifies you fucking criminals. Greed... Shall I tell you what I am gonna do? I'm gonna take every note on that table and burn it one by one, until you tell me where the missing girl is. D'you get me? She'll be dead way before you burn through all of my money. Challenge accepted, my man. You shouldn't have said that, bro. OK, if there's one thing I can do is burn money. Oh, shit... Whoa, whoa, it's going up. This really goes up, bro. What are you saying? Boys! Get in here! Boys, get in here. Tell us where the gang is! Tell us where they are! Boys! Is this guy not hearing me? There's a plank on the door. Bro, tell us where the crew is? What you saying? OK! OK! OK! OK what? I moved the crew to Red Hill. She was still alive. To where? Red Hill. Are you sure? Are you crazy?! Yeah, I've been asked that a few times in my life. Bish, it's time to go. Let's go. Baie dankie. Hey, don't mess around, y'know? Tell him to give us the gun. You are outnumbered. So don't be stupid. Tell him! Tell him! Put the fucking gun down before I kill him! Are you deaf, or your boss's headtop's gonna fly. Yeah, that's right, give it to me. Give it to me. Yeah, back up! Back up!

Trust me, it's warm. Listen, don't mess with me. Yeah? I don't have no family. I don't have no ties. He does, but he has got a great life insurance policy, they will be rich, don't mess with me. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door! Back up. Aah... Aah... Go! Go.What's wrong with you, man?! Throw it in the car! Boys! Bruv... Hold on. Listen. Listen.
