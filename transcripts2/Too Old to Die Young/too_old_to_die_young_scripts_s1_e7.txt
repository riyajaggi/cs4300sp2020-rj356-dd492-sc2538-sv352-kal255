 What would you like to know? How do you find them? I'm a victim's advocate. Some families require... a higher form of advocacy. So they come here. Then, when the time is right, they make an offering to me. They give me a name. I pass that along to Viggo. And he kills them. But as you know... Viggo's dying. And then what happens? That's up to you. Can I help you? MARTIN: Hi. I'm Detective Jones from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. An incident occurred in your neighborhood last night.

Okay, okay, I play, I play, I'm kidding. Listen. We all knew you were gonna grow up to be an incredible beauty, right? But please, I mean, come on. Is she a knockout or what? -Smokin' hot, huh? Smokin' hot. And I must say, I had something to do with that. I helped create that. I mean, she's got her mother's insane body, but the brains, baby? It's all about me. It's all about me. You know what, we're all-- -Seriously, we're all so fortunate to live in a world with Janey in it. This one here, she's gonna do big things. Ten years from now, all of us-- gonna be workin' for her. I'm not kidding. And the colleges are begging for her. She got into every single university that she applied to. That is pretty cool and pretty impressive. But you know what? I told her not to go. Because she is so cool. So guess what she's gonna do. She's comin' to work for Daddy. THEO: I mean, please, with her brains, her creativity, her ideas and my, uh, Rolodex and cash flow, I think we'll be pretty unstoppable. Hey. DAMIAN: Hey. I'm busy right now. We have a problem. Someone tried to kill me. All right, give me a minute. ALL: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Janey ♪ MAN: What's up, man? MARTIN: What's up? Where's he at? MAN: He's in the back. How are you healing up? Keeps ripping open. But you're okay? I'm good. So what's up? The Mexicans. They shot Celestino. Why? We've been having some territorial disputes. Seems like it's a war now. So what do you need from me? I need to find out what the police know. The shooter's dead. I've got my people on the streets asking around. But I need all the help I can get. I want to know I'm killing the right enemy. Can you do that for me? I can make a phone call for you. Hey, hey, partner. How's your cock? MARTIN: Hey, Red. 'Cause you're on sick leave. You're just lying around pullin' your pud, right? Look, I gotta run something by you. Come on. Let me hear you whackin' it. Hey, do you want to hear about my cock? No. I don't know, man, I'm just... so fuckin' horny all the time. You know what I'm sayin'? I don't know what it is. That's great. Hey, so you know that shooting outside an ice rink? Uh... yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. MARTIN: You guys get a hit on that yet? Why? You know somethin'? No, I just got a tip from an old source, and I want to see if it checks out. Well, look at you. You're tryin' to join the FFA. MARTIN: What's that? That's the Fist Fuckin' Association, my friend. See, you're tryin' to get your whole fist up the lieutenant's ass while you're not even on the clock. Impressive. Hey, Red. Just give me a call if you hear anything. Sure. What's the magic word? Please. No. Okay. Cock. Yes. I'll see what they got. But you're gonna have to wait 'til tomorrow. Oh, hey, listen. Me and lieutenant are workin' on a two man show for the ball. You should join us, be our straight man. You got a great serious face-- MARTIN: Thanks, Red. Whew. Please... tell me that motherfucker isn't a real cop. MARTIN: He's a real cop. Kinda. Take care of yourself. I'll let you know if I hear anything. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Where'd you go? I had a work thing. I thought you were on sick leave. They needed me for something. Sorry. It's okay. So, how was the rest of the party? Fine. MARTIN: You okay? JANEY: I just thought I'd feel different. Oh. Morning, my tiger. Sweet dreams? Huh? Sleeping beauty. I enjoy watching you sleep. That's a pretty nasty wound you got there, my friend. Might want to be careful. You know, you can, uh... wind up, uh... with an infection. Could kill ya. Yeah. Where's Janey? School. Finals. Why don't you get up, get dressed? I'd, uh-- I'd like to watch. Got something I want to show you. Wanna see? -Hi. -Hi. License and registration, please. Yeah. Here you go. -Mona? -Mm-hm. Whoa. I like that name. Mona. Mona. Mona. You sure you're only 21, Mona? MONA: Yep. And a donor. Generous. She's a saint. A saint with a pretty face. Hey, Mona. If I take this back to my car and I run it, will I find anything? -No. -No. Mm-mm. Okay. Well, uh, I'll leave you two alone to, uh, get better acquainted with each other. So, what do you think, tiger? It's all right. All right? Just all right? Very articulate. You wouldn't know art if it punched you in the face. And trust me. I will find something. I always find something. And you know what that gets you? That gets you a trip to jail... where you're gonna make some new friends... that just love to eat pussy. MONA: I'm sorry, what? OFFICER: Let me ask you something. You like eating pussy? MONA: Mm... no. OFFICER: No. That's too bad. So, what are you gonna do with it? Who the fuck knows. Excellent question, though. Not that you have any say in the matter. We'll give Janey a call. She's always got lots of great ideas. Guess what? This right here better be the best blowjob you ever-- No, no, no, no. No, don't cry. Mona. She never told you she was coming to work for me, did she? -No. -No. OFFICER: Open that pretty mouth. Open up wide. I saw you two last night. I was watching. It was fun. You two looked like you were having a good time. Tell me, tiger, what do you think? My Janey, she's, what-- between us men-- she's a 10, right? She's-- She's a 10. You know, I always thought if she wasn't my daughter... Got to admit I was a little jealous... watching a Neanderthal like you make love... to my little princess. But now that I own you... brings me back to a nagging question that I've been wanting to ask for a long, long time. What happened in your pathetic life? How did it become so incredibly banal that you were willing to throw it all away... over a little bit of young pussy, huh? Why don't you tell me, Martin? Give me a little peak-- little peak-- into who you really are. Huh? Just tell me about that. Yeah. Hey, where you goin', tiger? Goin' for a little bit more young pussy? I need to get rid of someone. MARTIN: Hey. VIGGO: Hey. Who's this? Someone who needed to go. What did he do? And you need my help. I need to get rid of the body. And the car. VIGGO: Follow me. JANEY: Daddy? Dad? He's not here. You want a Topo Chico? CARRIE: You want to do some coke? JANEY: Sure. But I want a Topo Chico first. We rented a place in the Hamptons for the summer. You want to come? I can't. We're going to Mykonos. You and Martin? No. Me and my dad. What about Martin? I don't think he can get that much time off work. He could take a week off, though, right? Come for part of the time. I don't think he'd like it. Hm. So you finally met him? Who? Don't be such a cunt. I don't know. He seemed fine. Just fine? He was kind of rude, honestly. We fucked last night. Right there, actually. Gross. He always lets me come first. You know, this morning... I woke up... he was lying next to me. I looked at him. He was asleep. And he was covered in blood. He's got that wound that just won't heal. It turned me on. What is wrong with you? I'm serious. What's wrong with you? I love him. You're gonna end up with someone like your dad. So what are you doing? Is this Detective Jones, vice president of the FFA? MARTIN: Hey, Red. So, why are you callin'? Uh, your tip. The gang killings. You hear anything? Well, I found out that there's no leads, there's no suspects, there's no evidence, there's no minorities. Nothin'. But who cares? Let 'em all kill each other. Hey, uh, hang on, Jones. Lieutenant wants to say hey. Hey, polyester. Hey, lieutenant. A little gerbil named Red's been singing your praises in my ear all day. Says you're ready to get back to it. Not really. I just wanted to check on a lead. That's what I like to hear. You know what? I'm gonna call your doctor and tell him you're ready to come back, get you reinstated early, you big lug. I probably need another week or so. Balderdash. It's just a knife wound, man. I mean, look what happened to Jesus. He had nails hammered through him. That would be painful. He was back on his feet in three days. Yeah, you're just dying to come back to work and you know it. Next time, we should exterminate 'em all, one by one. -Yeah. -Return this country to what is used to be; shining city on a hill. Sure. I'll talk to my doctor. Do you mind if we make a stop on the way back? No. I gotta give a friend some bad news. More bad news, huh? Hey, pull over. You okay? Yeah, just pull over right here. Feelin' better? I gotta tell you something. What's that? You know that guy in the trunk of the car? That was my girlfriend's dad. Why did you kill him? I don't know. Shouldn't have lied to me. What does the girl know? She doesn't know anything. When she starts asking questions, what then? Will you kill her, too? No, I wouldn't do that. I'll figure it out. I just thought I could control it. I feel like two different people. I don't like it. I don't want to be a cop anymore. You want to come in?
