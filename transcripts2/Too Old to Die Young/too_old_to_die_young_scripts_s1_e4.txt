 Look at me. Do you like what you see? Well, I knew you'd come back to us eventually. The murderer always returns to the scene of his crime. Oh, I know, this isn't the exact spot where the deed occurred, but you had to see her, didn't you? You had to see the result of your monstrous act. - But I loved her. - You loved her. What do you know about love? I've love her ever since she was a child. No, you did it, and you must pay for it.

 How did you find her? She was such a sweet girl. I thought the shooting gallery was closed tonight. It is, it sounded like it came from over there. What's going on in here, buddy? My partner... was at the driver's window. I was at the back. Guy in the passenger seat moves. I can see something in his hand. So I... fire into the car. Over and over... and over. And over.

 They told me the, uh... girl in the back seat... was, uh, 15. I never saw her until she was dead. I keep seeing her now. This little girl. And it's just, uh... I don't know, what am I supposed to do? She's just a... little... girl. And, uh... if, uh-- If I could just-- If I could have just controlled myself. And now... I've lost everything. Why I couldn't go back on patrol. Can't even look at my wife. And... I just-- Just feel like, um... wrong. Like I, uh-- Like I shouldn't be here. Like I'm... I'm just... wrong. I'm... I'm-- I'm wrong. Let's all thank Greg for sharing. All right. So that's our time. I'll see you all on Tuesday. And remember: be aware of your triggers. Don't let fear be your driver. What's up, big man? Mister family man. Hey, George. -Been a while. -Yeah, glad to be back. So, how's the construction business treating you? Ah, decent. I've been on a job up in Santa Barbara. Well, there's a great meeting Tuesdays and Thursdays up in Montecito. Yeah, I'll check it out. You should. Gotta take care of yourself. Yeah. Always good to see a new face. I'm Quinn. Mike. Is this your first time? Yeah. George said these meetings had been real helpful. Oh, I'm glad to hear it. How do you two know each other? Mike was in my squad overseas. Oh. Well, feel free to share next time. We get a lot of veterans here. Yeah? Maybe I will. Thank you. I gotta clean up a little bit, but some of us are going to the bar down the street. You two want to join us? Well... It's not AA. It's a PTSD meeting. I know. So, you guys in? Maybe next time. We gotta be somewhere. Okay. See you guys. Be good. That guy, Greg. For many years now he's been raping his daughter. He said that, uh, if she told anyone, he'd kill her mother. How do you feel about that? Start the car. Hey, Greg. Hey, George, what's up? These clowns are on the sidelines. They're just white noise background for the collapse of the American empire. And when America falls, my friend, then we are headed back to the dark ages. Are you feelin' me here? Now do you understand what I mean when I say dark ages? I mean, humans reduced to roving bands of barbarians. Animals! That's what the dark ages were. Little patches of humanity and society surrounded by a sea of barbarian hordes. And where there was society-- Once there was just men and nature. Then men came bearing crosses. We used to believe that we were the center of the universe. That the sun and the stars all revolved around us. And we spent the last 500 years since Copernicus in this slow crawl... to where we are now; to this pinnacle of human achievement. Where we finally bent nature to our will. We split the atom. We broke the fabric of reality. That's how far we've come. Now the lights of our cities stretch further than the stars in the sky. But the more perfect society gets... the more psychotic we become. We evolved through brutality. That's why we had teeth and claws. Self preservation was the highest law. But as time went on... the pack began to provide for us... and we abandoned our violent nature. But it never went away. Laid beside us in our sleep. Waiting. And as it waited... we became slaves to the systems we built. Now it's all falling apart. Soon our cities will be washed away by floods. Buried in sand. Burned to the ground. That's why you found me. Because you're no longer blind to all this. When I was in the bureau... I got shot in the head. I lost my eye. My body deteriorated. And I died for three minutes. But when I came back from the other side, everything was clear to me. It was like I'd been given a gift. As the world fractures... Someone... Someone has to be there to protect innocence. Do you trust him? Yes. Good. Because I see beautiful things in him. An undying flame who will devour all he touches. A new breed of destruction. Exterminating through violence, but... cloaked in creation. We will handle him with care. But we must be cautious... of his hunger. For he is one of us. Let's choose a stone. No. Not yet. Choose again, Viggo. Yes. His name is Finnigan. He works at a middle school. As a track coach. What did he do? He molested seven students. Okay. Good. Don't kill him at the school. Thank you. Thank God! It's Friday! Nice! Yeah! Because we got our morning treat. - Yeah! - And this time you will not be disappointed. Uke. Uke. Uke. Uke. Uke. Uke. Uke. Uke. Uke. -Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. You are beautiful. You're beautiful. -Especially Hank. But before the fun begins, a moment of silence... for our brothers, and our sisters who serve a higher purpose. Feels pretty good, doesn't it? Doesn't it? Yeah. -Amen. -Amen. Give me an F. F. - Give me an A. - A. - Give me an S. - S. - Give me a C. - C! - Give me an Ism. - Ism! - What's that spell? Fascism! - What's that spell? - Fascism! - Fascism! - Fascism! Fascism! -ALL: Fascism! - Fascism! - Fascism! - Fascism! Fascism! Fascism! Fascism! Fascism! Fascism! Fascism! Fascism! -Yeah! Fascism! -All right! Whoo! Yeah! Well, okay. -That was good, wasn't it? -Mm-hm. Damn. Got a little something special for ya... that my mom wrote. Woo! It's called "Baby Jane's Closet." And it goes a little bit... like this. Jesus. Mary. The baby. Thank you. Thank you. -So good! -Thank you. You're the best! You're the best! You're the best! - So good! - Bravo! So good! So good! So good! You crush it! Jones. Yeah, there's a George Jenkins here to see you. Who? George Jenkins. He said it's about the dead ducks in his pond. You got time to take a drive? I'll meet you out front. Someone really kill that guy's ducks? Yeah. It's a tragedy. Psst. Jones, get in here. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Get in here. Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. Hey, Jones. Want to help me and Davis prank the Lieutenant? -Huh? Meet Sergeant Manny Kin. This guy graduated top of his class at the academy. Lieutenant is interviewing him for the open detective slot. What do you think? It's funny. I gotta go. -Are you sure? -Yep. Seriously, what's the deal with the ducks? Ducks are dead. You know, these brutes in the inquisition, they did not see other people as humans. That's how they did what they did. Raping, burning, pillaging. They had this thing called the pear. They'd put it in a prisoner's mouth, and when they'd crank it, it would open and tear their face apart, breaking their teeth and their jaw. That's what the pear was used for. We just might see that come back, dear friends. Are you ready for that? Feel that one. How many of you out there want-- Mom, you have to tell me if you want to take a walk, okay? I just wanted to say hi. Hi. Hi. What are you doing? Well, I just got home from school. So I'm doing my homework right now. What about you? I'm standing in a freezer. Why? I'll tell you later. Well, I have this paper due and I need a good adjective. Stabbed. Can you spell that for me? Stabbed. You're so smart. - Hey. - Hey. I gotta go, okay? My dad's calling me. Bye. Janey! Coming, Daddy. Yeah, Daddy? You got another one. "It is with great pleasure that I write to invite you "to join the first year class "in the college of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University." Are you happy now? Okay? Where the hell are you going? I have homework. Homework. I'm calling bullshit. You're a senior. That's-- What? That's seven now. How many more are there? Um... I think there's two more. But I still don't know what I'm gonna do yet, so please stop asking me. Mum's the word. How about we go out and celebrate, huh? -Grab a bite? -No, I'm pretty tired. Can we just get take out or something? Sure, sure. Martin comin' over? No. He's gotta work. Mm. You talkin' to him about all this? We don't really get into that stuff. I wouldn't imagine you two do much talking. -Dad-- -Hey. I'm a dad, you're a teenager. That's why I'm here. To embarrass you. Right? I just want you to know something. I'm never gonna stop carrying you, Janey. Just because you're a big girl now doesn't mean that's ever gonna end. I remember the day you were born. I was the first one you looked at. Yeah. I know, Daddy. Why don't you come work for me? Doing what? Anything your little heart desires. Anything. You spend the next four years of your life at a university, be a total step backwards for somebody like you. You walked the red carpet at Cannes when you were 12. "The New Yorker" published your essays at 14, "The Times" had your op-ed piece when you were 15. I don't want you to just come work for me, you're my partner. All the way. I mean, you-- you've always had these incredible dreams, and I've got hundreds of millions to play with. Between your insane ideas and my Rolodex, you and me, please. We'd rule the world. Your mom always said that... you deserve everything. Except her. Yeah, right. Except her. But don't let what happened ever stop you from becoming the woman you were meant to be. I love you, Dad. I love you more. You want to help her? No. It's a cruel world. What are you doing here? Just stopping by. Really? What did he do? Who? The Korean guy. Lots of bad stuff. Yeah? Like what? If I have to explain everything to you, we'll be here forever. I've got time. I don't. Life is short. You just need to be who you are. And let us deal with the rest. The less you know, the simpler it all is. That's my daughter. Right back out there. Just go out there and kill him. Hey. Why does Damien have a problem with you? I don't know. I'm gonna ask you again. 'Cause I was supposed to kill you tonight. I owe him money. How much? 8,000. That's it? I'm gonna need you to get it. Now? Wait here. It's all here. All right. We're good. You should get that hand looked at. Can I get a ride to the hospital? No. But that looks real bad. Get the fuck outta here. Keep it. I'm not doing this anymore. What's the problem? I'm not gonna kill a guy... over $8,000. He knew what he was gettin' into. Well, I'm done. I understand. This isn't for everybody. Maybe we can find you something else to do. You want to run some girls? No. What can I give you? I want the worst guys you got. Let me see your phone. Ever been to Albuquerque? I got something for you. Two of them. Brothers. What'd they do? They're pornographers. They make rape films. All you need to know... is what they do to all those innocent people. All right. I'll do it. I'll give you... let's say $5,000. I don't want it. You want the blood. Not the money. Well, with such high moral standards... how can I say no? Hey. What are you doing later? I'm headed out of town for a few days. Okay. What's up? It's all right, it can wait. All right. What are you doing? I'm hunting. Good luck. Find what you're looking for? Yeah. How's it run? Hell, runs great. And this here is a five liter V8 302. And this baby was made in America. It will run forever. I'll take it. Well, let's get you the keys.
