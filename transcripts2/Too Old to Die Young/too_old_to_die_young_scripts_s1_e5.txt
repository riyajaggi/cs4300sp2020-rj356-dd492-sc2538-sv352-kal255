 Your skin is like porcelain. So, what do you want to do today? I really want to get fucked. That's so good to hear. I mean, look at you. You're such a cute boy. Tell us, what do you like to fantasize about? I-- I don't know. I don't-- Sorry, I'm just shy. You haven't met my brother yet. - Have you? - No. Well, I used to fantasize about him jerking me off after school.

 So... come on. I-- I don't know. I'm sorry. How long is this gonna take? Why? You got something better to do? No, I-- I just-- Um, I-- I don't-- I just-- You're gonna love today. How's your asshole? Is it hot? Wet? Craving? Do you like sucking cock? Yeah. When did you start? Whose cock did you suck first? A friend? An uncle? Your dad? Just a friend. Were you really young? I was 16, I think. And are you a natural cock sucker? Guess... I am. Show me. Suck your thumb. That's great. Here, take this pill. What? Open up, little buddy, open wide. Wider. -That's it, swallow. Swallow. Good boy. Wh-- What was that? Let's just call it a birthday present. This is how it's going to work. We're going to charge a dollar per pop for your asshole. Fifty cents for your mouth. You just have to fill out the contract and we'll get started. Here you go. Now, I want you to sign this line right here. Take the pen. Take it. You gotta sign right there. Well, what's it say? That's just a formality, it's-- Yeah, right there. Sign right there. That just says you consent to anything that happens here today. -Right. -Okay. Yeah, right there. That a boy. Oh, good. Good. Real good. Okay. I'm gonna go. Little Billy here is gonna take over. You just do anything he tells you to do. Uh, uh-- Can I use the bathroom real quick... before we get started? Do me a favor. Let me just see you smile one more time. Okay, boys. Rape him. No. In every puritan country, you will always find a morbid preoccupation with sex coupled with every form of perversion and degeneracy. But I say that sin which is unpardonable, unforgivable, is the knowing rejection of truth, the fear of knowledge, and black magic is not a myth. This is knowledge. Magic is the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with will. The Nazis knew this. This is why they used the swastika-- that powerful and ancient symbol of magic-- and they nearly conquered the world. Brother Rod knows this. Thank you for being here today, Brother Rod. Brother Stevie. Front row kinda guys. I want to talk about unity. These are two gentlemen out in the community in broad daylight walkin' every day in unity with a swastika in their hands and their hearts, unashamed of what others think. Okay? Now, we live out here in what's called a fly over region. The elite fly over, they can't even see us out the window of their jet aircraft, and they laugh at us and make fun of us, everything else, claim that we cling to our God and our guns. Well, maybe we do. But what do they cling to? Perversion, degeneracy, and every kind of ill you can think of, and they're gonna laugh at us? There's another creature lives out here with us, it's a rattlesnake. Got two fangs loaded with poison. You leave it be, it's fine. Won't harm anyone. But if you step on it, you're gonna feel its fangs. Well, I got two fangs, too, and I won't be stepped on. My fangs are Smith and Wesson, revolver and semi-automatic. And I'm not sayin' go do somethin' crazy, I'm just sayin' don't let them defang you. You have strength as long as you're in unity with the power and the magic of the swastika. All right. Okay. But-- But that reminds me. Is she ready? You haven't paid us yet. The money will be here in the morning. -From Panama? -No, no, no, from the USA. Okay. And, uh-- I'll tell Rod to have her ready in the morning. Okay. I-- I can't wait. I-- I-- I can't wait. It'll be worth it. I'll talk to Rod about the others. Okay, we'll ta-- And the other thing. How's everything else goin'? Mm, mm. You're lookin' good. You lost some weight. Thanks. You take care of yourself, all right? All right. Shots. Hey, sweetheart. How's your day? I can't complain. How about you? I saw you drive in the other day, and you were in some kind of weird car. -What was that? -It's electric. Okay. - That's organic. - Right. - Yeah. - How many today? Um, four, and then another for my brother. Okay. Your girl score a goal yet? She got... two this weekend. Wow. That's amazing. Well, let's see, the score was 25 to 40. I'm mean, they're so small, they don't even have a goalie. - Still, good for her. - Thank you. You're welcome. I want you to, um, celebrate with this. Okay. Let me know where it's gonna be, I'm gonna try to stop by later. Okay, I will. Thank you. -You're welcome. -Thanks. Hey, buddy. Help me with this. -I can get it, Rod, it's-- -No, no, no, no. Relax. -He's got it. Right? -Yeah. Thanks, man. You need something? Um... no. Sorry. -Cheers. -Cheers! Cheers. Hey, do you want another drink? No, I'm good. Well... how about just in case? It's on the house. Hey, sorry to bother you guys, but I've just kinda been sittin' at the bar talkin' to myself for the last couple hours, um, it's gettin' pretty lonely over there, and... I'm not from here or anything so, um... would it be okay if maybe I join you? What's your name? Kevin. Well, sure, Kevin. Why don't you just grab us a bottle of something, and come here and join us. Well, that's really nice of you. Thanks. Alrighty. The more the merrier. This guy a friend of yours? Mm-mm. We'll see. Looks like a friend of yours. She said you guys like this stuff a lot. -Yeah, man. Would you like to sit? Yeah. Thanks. Mm-hm. I'm Rod. This is my brother Stevie. That's Wendy. This is Sandy. It's nice to meet you guys. Mm-hm. What brings you to Albuquerque, Kevin? I'm a salesman. What do you sell? I'm not a salesman. I don't know why I said that. So, what are you doing here? My girlfriend left me. And I just started driving. How long have you been on the road? A few weeks. Where you headed? I don't know. Act like you don't care. Maybe not. What does my future matter, anyway? It's all collapsing around us. Society's falling. You're fuckin' A right. Hm. What about you, what do you guys do? We make porn. Really? Yeah. Whoa. That's cool. You watch porn? -Uh-- Are you saying you don't watch porn? No. I watch porn. -Oh. -What kind? What kind of porn do you watch? -Fisting. -My hand is small. It's perfect. Girl asked you a question. I don't know. Just your regular porn. Kind of boring stuff. Threesomes, I guess. Well... two girls or two guys? Oh, two guys. I knew it! That feeling of your cock rubbin' up against another man's junk. Nothin' separating those two cocks but a thin piece of skin. You bi? I don't think so. You ever fuck a guy? I have. When? When I was in middle school. Where are you from, brother? So, what kind of porn do you guys make? All kinds. Like what? Let me give you a little taste. You taking off? Got work to do. Hey, thanks for the drinks, Kevin. Yeah, nice to meet you. All right. Check this out. Oh... Nice. Okay. Wow. Is that girl asleep? You like what you see? Yeah. Do you? I don't think you do. Can I give you some advice? Go back home. Apologize to your girl. I can't. Why? It's complicated. She's 16. You fucked a 16-year-old? Where'd you meet her? I was working. And I saw her on the side of a road. She was crying. I just looked at her in her school girl uniform. And it really turned me on. I fucked her that night. On the hood of my car. You're my hero. How did it feel? Felt good. I mean you. How'd you feel? I don't know. I don't really talk about this stuff. You should go get him a shot. Sure. Turn around. Kevin. What are you doin' later? Why? You want to be in a scene? What do you mean? You know. I don't know. I don't think I can be in a porn. Give me a good reason why. I mean, what if someone sees it? I thought you said your future didn't matter. We don't have to see your face. Come on. I'll let you do anything you want. Really? Like what? Whatever gets you hard. All right. But I want to wear a mask. Sure. Come on. Right now? Do you have something better to do? This is it. This is where the magic happens. We built this prison set. Very dark. Very sexy. This'll be good for you. Wait here. I'll get my brother. Hey, little brother. Hey, little brother. Is he here? Mm-hm. Don't fucking move. Hi, Little Billy. Enjoying the view? Back in a minute. So this is our new star, huh? Something like that. Hm. I likes. I'm gonna grab Little Billy so we can shoot his Johnson. Now... I need to see your cock. I really... need to see your cock. -Motherfucker! Damn! -You missed? -Yep. Motherfuck! -What the fuck are you doin'? This motherfucker's a dead motherfucker. Get him, get him, get him. -Shoot him! -Damn! -How the fuck do you miss? I don't know. Motherfuckin' piece of shit. Oh... You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me. You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me. This motherfucking piece of electric shit. Shit! Motherfucker! Outta juice! Outta juice. What I've give for a tank of gasoline right now. -Little Billy. -Yeah. I want you to shoot this cocksucker. Well, I would if I wasn't out of ammo, and if we'd have taken your brother Stevie's car-- by the way, which was an American made car-- instead of this pile of shit sardine can, we probably wouldn't be in this son-of-a-bitchin' situation, now would we? Wow. What a thinker you are. I mean, that's like amazing. Julius Caesar lookin' mother-- -What the fuck! She's still alive. What'd you say? She's still alive. She'll be dead soon. Who? The girl. That's not why you're here? No. But where is she? In the desert. Show me. She's over there. Key. Let's go. She's down here. What'd you guys do to her? You wouldn't understand. Get her out. I got a shovel by my trailer. Of course, I can't dig her out in these. Try. All right. Come on, you cocksucker. Fuckin' rocks. Come on, man. Really? Okay. She'll just die while I fuckin' do this. Motherfucker. Open it. Get her out. I got a key in my pocket. Calm down, little flower. You don't want to anger him. Shh, shh. He cuts the ones that make him angry. -Shh. I'm not gonna hurt you. Fuck! Goddamnit.
