As a token of my love... ...I hereby give you Yaritza. Anyone who asks...

 Can you do it by Sunday? Is it a problem if I can't? Yes it's a problem. Why? It's for Magdalena's son. He returns on Monday. He wants to send a message. What's the message? They've been taking her territory. That ends now. What are you gonna pay me? Five thousand. That's too cheap for the shot caller. He's worth ten grand at least. They're just a bunch of mayates. How about eight? Six. Or you can go fuck your mother. Okay. But I get the money upfront. Half, like always. Come on Alfonso. This is some Kamikaze shit. You want a discount if I'm killed? Can you do it by Sunday or not? Do I get the money upfront? You mother fucker... You're robbing me blind man. Look. Here you go... That's it. -All I have now is a rubberband. -Alright. Later. -Later. They park on the side, here. They're out there drinking beers and talking shit all the time. How many are there? I never saw more than four. But, all we want... ...is one guy. This guy. Damian. -Alfonso asked for me to do this? -Yes. He wants you, Jaime. I told him you had a baby on the way... ...you needed some extra cash. Look at this as an opportunity... ...to impress the big man. How much extra cash? Two thousand. -Two thousand? -Half upfront. -Half? That's how this business works man. Final payment when you finish the job. -On delivery. -Delivery? So do I have to cut off his head? So you want the thousand? Yes, I want it. This guy... -They hang out outside their ice rink. Okay... Yeah, yeah, the mayates, I got it! Gameboy, it's just one guy. I got it! Relax. You want the money or not? Do I get some crystal too? I got you covered. -Yeah.... that! That's the stuff. Wanna hit? That's the stuff. That's the stuff. Gameboy... You need to stay sharp. These mayates don't mess around. I'm fine fucker. Those dumbasses are going down. You know that. Sure Gameboy. Right, you're the man. You got the money on you? You get the other hundred when it's done. By Sunday, remember. It's all good. What day is today? Friday. Cool... I got plenty of time. No. Just one day. Don't worry, I'll do it tomorrow night. I'm nocturnal. You know I don't sleep. -You forgot the beer. I'm off tonight, tell Ping Pong. Did you take my pipe? We're supposed to blend in. We leave in twenty minutes. I'm going to take a shower. This was my mother's favorite skirt. Turn around. Now you look like the lady of the house. I'll take this one. You're sure? Is that a problem? That's a powerful gun. Something a bit smaller might be better for you. Like a twenty two. Something you can hide in a purse. Just trying to help. The police here don't like armed Mexicans. They'll fuck you. Right. Magdalena's son. He's all grown up right? I didn't work for her. I worked with her. But no, you and I never met. We're all set. There's one other thing. Damian. Tell Don Miguel we took care of him. Remind him I took care of it personally. Can you get me one like this... But with a diamond-studded grip? I want something beautiful. Can you do that? Of course. I'm a craftsman. How do you want it? The outside grip studded with diamonds. Do you know Tarot? Yeah. You know the Hanged Man? Yeah, the... The upside down guy. Can you paint this on the inside grip? You want gold-plated bullets too? I'm keeping the gun... ...not the bullets. We have to do something about Alfonso. Let's see what happens first. You know I'm right. Tell me about your mother. My mother didn't want me to be Mexican. That's why she came here to give birth to me. She wanted me to be American. Was she mad at you? Nobody steals from the cartel. She'd make you lunch? I've got something for you. I have something important to tell you. I've always loved this fucking house. Wow. Hey, girl. How you doing? We have a little problem. But don't worry. And I wanted to bring it to you... ...and give it to you personally, sweetheart. It's all yours. You like it right? I wouldn't call it a problem so much as... ...as a delay. Oh, mother fucker... Look at this. Mother Magdalena. That is a beautiful woman. She looks so alive. Don't worry. My people are handling it. They're doing what they have to... ...to solve this problem for you. ...we killed the wrong mayate. Just that. They killed the wrong guy. That's still one less mayate in the world, right? Fuck... no. Absolutely not. Just give me a few days... ...we'll find him. Done. What? What did you say, motherfucker? Yes, boss. Get out. What's over there? Do you want to go? I do. I want to see your past. Because Miguel's afraid of me. Death follows me. She's here with us. Your mother. She's all around. She sees you. What do you want from her? Do you want to touch her? Do you want to feel her? Then why don't you?
