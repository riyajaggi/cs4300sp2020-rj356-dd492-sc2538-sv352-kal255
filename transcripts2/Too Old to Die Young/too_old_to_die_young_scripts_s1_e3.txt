 I want you to understand... that this is not going to make you whole again. There is no direct path towards reversing the depths of your wounds. Consider this... A door opening. (inhales) (exhales) And once it's done, you will feel doubt. You will feel regret.

 You will feel guilt. You will feel the need to confess. But this is normal... and it's all part of the process that you're on towards your own radical self-healing. What that man did... is unforgivable. But it's your choice now. Will you allow him to define the rest of your life? Or will you define it? (door opens) (door closes) I've been told the hardest part of this journey... is not just feeling doubt.

 Guilt. But rather feeling trapped by these emotions. And when you get there, then you feel that weight, I want you to go back to the mantra that I taught you. Time is a river. It flows both ways. Embrace its flow. And change your life. (exhales) This isn't about money. But something of value does need to be... exchanged. You can consider it an offering. (exhales) These were my mother's. I'm so sorry for everything you've been through. (indistinct chatter on radio) MAN (on radio): It's now coming true. The only thing I was wrong about is the date. I thought we had more time. But on that point, I was wrong. Time is right now. I said there'd be people rounded up in camps again in America. One of the Japanese internment camps-- You remember them? I said that our human rights would be restricted. (alarm dings) (engine sputtering) (alarm dinging) (dinging continues) (dog barking) -(barking continues) -(vehicle passing) (men chattering in distance) Shit. (exhales) (police siren in distance) (glove compartment opens) (objects rustling) (compartment closes) (exhales) (lighter clicks) (engine cranking) (door closes) (latch clicks) (man shouting in distance) (shouting continues) (gunfire) (dog barking) (police siren approaching) (helicopter passing overhead) You're early. What happened? I had some complications. ♪♪ (theme) (camera shutter clicks) (shutter clicking) MAN: Tow truck driver found the body when we were clearing the scene last night. Does that have anything to do with this? Nah, that's just a LAPD thing. Outside of the fence is their jurisdiction. (camera shutter clicking) What's his story? Zack Thomas, sex offender, early release from Lompoc. -(camera shutter clicks) -Hmm. -So it's a victimless crime. -(chuckles) How'd the car end up out here? Ran out of gas. Reported stolen from the parking lot at 19:40 last night. Owner seemed happy to hear we found it. He sound believable? Yeah. Had no idea there was a body in the trunk. Just wanted to know where to pick it up. You got an address for that parking lot? Yeah, Here. I can't read that. What's it say? Shit. Uh, that's definitely a three. Uh-- I tell you what. I'll just forward you the report. How 'bout that? Yeah, that's fine. All right, I'm good here. If you get a hit on anything, give me a call. Will do. (camera shutter clicking) MARTIN: You didn't notice any of this last night? MAN: No, I didn't even know it was stolen until the owner came back. All right. Let me see your credit card receipts from last night. Sorry. We're cash-only, man. You have no record of who comes in here? Dude, we're just a parking lot. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq. You like that? That's French. WOMAN (on phone): Mm-hmm. -Yeah. -Oh, oui, oui. There's a couple of stinky French girls. WOMAN (on phone): Oui. (giggles) Nothing I like more than Europeans. (woman laughing) You are just friendly. Terrence! Good work last night, bud. It was all you, L.T. Boom! Krissy! Krissy! (imitates shocking) Red, no more prank calls. I'm watching you, buddy. Aye, aye, Lieutenant. -New guy! -Yes, sir. Hey, new guy. So what's the catch of the day? Body in the trunk of a stolen car. Dang. Who? Zack Thomas, child molester. Who's that? This is Thomas's victim. He was the kid's physical therapist. What happened? He raped him... like a thousand times Bummer. You working this solo? -Yeah. -Okay, give me the rundown. All right. Not a lot to tell. The car was stolen out of a parking lot by this guy. Looks like he ran out of gas and left the body in the trunk. You ever had a case like this? No, sir. Okay, let me show you how this goes. Red, you got any scratch paper? Yeah. (clears throat) There you go, Lieutenant. You gotta cut that out, Red. Not on company time, bud. That's what she said. Oh, shit. You okay there, bud? Okay, first... you wanna talk to the parents of the victims before the news gets out, see how they react. Second, check their financials. Look for any recent activity over a couple grand. Now, listen, there's gonna be a lot of people who wanted this Zack Thomas guy dead, lots of suspects. Look. I'm gonna let you in on a little something, but it stays in the vault, okay? Yeah. All right. (inhales) What do I have here, Martin? A single dice? To you it is, but to me? It's a philosophy. I had the highest clearance rate in the squad because of this. You can follow evidence and build theories all day long, and then your perp turns out to be some random stranger. We force order onto life, so we believe our choices matter. But it's really all random, isn't it? So you have to embrace that. If I didn't know which way to go or which evidence meant what, I rolled the dice. (die clatters) Just give each choice a number and roll. Let then universe decide, like Jung's collective unconscious. I-- I don't know who that is. -Carl Jung? -No. Longer conversation for another day. Beer, steak. You wearing polyester? It breathes. Anyway. Give it a shot. Okay? Yeah. Thank you. Good man. (phone rings) Jones. WOMAN: Hey, it's Powers from the crime lab. Yeah, you got a hit? Yeah, print off the car key matched someone in the database. I'm sending it over right now. Viggo Larsen, former FBI agent. Took a medical leave 10 years ago. What is this guy doing at the scene? Who knows? But good luck. Thanks. Do you disappear now? I don't know yet. Your mother's gonna be okay no matter what happens. If they come, I won't get any warning. They'll freeze all my assets. She'll be lost. So I'm gonna get you the money you'd need for her and the name of the home you can place her in. I've promised you that. And for now, we just go about our lives. This guy next week, I'm gonna use a gun, make it look like a suicide. No. Now is not the time to be creative. You stick to what we agreed upon. I should have just shot out the window, taken the key. Why didn't you? I got spooked. These dialysis treatments, I think they're messing with my head. Let us just imagine that they do find a print. What is the time frame until they match it to you? -Five minutes. -Hmm. (exhales) I don't see the cops wasting many man hours on a dead child molester. REBECCA: I take the kids to school at 8:00. My husband works nine to five, so I'm home most of the time. MARTIN: Great. -(paper shuffling) -(Martin sighs) Have you ever seen this guy before? Not that I know of. Who is he? He's just a person of interest. Why? It's not important. Do you have any objection to us looking into your bank accounts? No. Look at whatever you want. Thank you. MIKEY: Mom, what's going on? Nothing, honey. Hey, buddy. Who's this? REBECCA: He's from the police. Zack Thomas was killed. Good. Hey, maybe you could give me and your mom a few minutes? You can talk in front of Michael. It's fine. You ever seen this guy before? No. Who is he? Nobody. Are you sure that neither you or your husband had any contact with Zack Thomas after he was released? Trust me, Detective, I'd remember. You know, I showed no interest in Zack Thomas at all. But people aren't who you think they are. Or maybe they are. But there's someone else, too. Someone you don't get to see. (wind whistling) (gunshot) (gunshot) (rifle cocks) (horse nickers) MAN: Mother... what color is this? -WOMAN: I'm-- I'm sorry. -That's okay. That's okay. What, uh-- what color-- what color is it? -It's blue. -Blue. Mm-hmm. -(sighs) -And which of these tiles is blue? (sighs) No. Blue. Mm-hmm. (machinery whirring) Can I have another? WOMAN: What'd you have? I don't know. Vodka? Where did you get it? The other bartender. Think his name was Mick. Did he I.D. you? No. How old are you? I'm 22. (scoffs) You can't be in here. (glass thuds) Too late. You've gotta get the fuck out. Just pour the drink or I'll report this place. How old are you really? Seventeen? I'm 22. Your cheeks haven't even hollowed out yet. Are you jealous? (sniffs) No. When I was your age, I could get whatever I wanted for free. I'm surprised you can even remember that far back. Let me tell you something. (sighs) It never works out the way you wanted. Why are you here? It's my mother's memorial. Come here. I wanna show you something. (footsteps approaching) This is how old I really am. Seventeen. You guessed it. And this? This is why it doesn't matter. MAN: Losing her was a devastation I will never, ever overcome. Sometimes at night, I still hear the phone ring. I hear Janey's voice. I often wonder, "What if she had seen the car? What if the driver had--" -Everything okay? -Yeah. MAN: It's what we struggle with, right? Margot was a brilliant talent, an intense, fearless artist, as you could see so clearly displayed by her remarkable work. Wow. Well, in honor and celebration of her life, I decided to buy this space. And I'm very pleased to announce that this work, this installation will remain here for the rest of the year. And then it will travel to Europe, and I'm sure it's gonna be a smash there, too. I am also an artist of sorts. I am an innovator. People have been telling me that my entire life. I take chances others won't. I see opportunities others don't. And here I see an opportunity to make some very serious cash. So after Margot's show travels across the pond to England, we've decided that we will utilize this space to allow other young women to develop and showcase their incredible artistry. Which is something I know for sure Margot would absolutely love. So I'm very honored and proud to present the inaugural Margot and Theodore Carter Fine Arts Mentorship Award to my very dear and my very sweet friend, Rachel Chen. Congratulations. We adore you all. Margot loves you. And we love you, Margot. (kisses) Thank you. Who's gonna be first? Hmm? Don't be shy. (clears throat) (clears throat) I miss my mother. (sniffles) She would have really appreciated the gesture here. Um... (sniffles) I... Shouldn't have left me. (sniffling) Can I stay at your place tonight? Yeah. Of course. I just have to do something in the morning. Anything interesting? I gotta follow a guy with one eye. One eye? Is he a pirate? I don't know. That wasn't in his file. (sniffles) Is he dangerous? Could be. I'm not sure yet. I just got a feeling about him. He was ex-FBI. And then he just disappeared. Like a ghost? Yeah. So how'd you find him? Because he's dying. (door closes) (engine starts) (engine starts) (door opens) (door closes) Hi. Are you good? Yes. The sun is in Capricorn. And the beings are well. Thank you. Your mom's going to be okay. I'm glad. Good. Go ahead. -Clear? -Yes. (car door slams) (car engine starts in distance) MAN: This is Detective 2-0-4. I need to run a plate. WOMAN: Car is registered to a Diana Sofia DeYoung. Miss DeYoung has listed as her employer, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. MAN: What does she do there? WOMAN: Victim's advocate, violent crime division. WOMAN: You misunderstand what we do here. We're not lawyers. We provide assistance to victims. Uh-huh. Elder abuse, domestic violence, victims of sexual assault, children who've-- Right. No, I understand. I'm on a call. I can wait. We can talk tomorrow. Thanks. Bye. How can I help you? I'm Detective Jones. Do you have a few minutes to talk? Sure. Thank you. What's the case number? I don't have one. (pen drops) So how can I help you? You counseled the family from the Zack Thomas case. -Correct? -Multiple families. Which family are you talking about? Gilkens. Their son was 11 years old. Crippled. Thomas was his physical therapist. Michael, I know them well. Did something happen? Well, Zack Thomas's body was found. He was murdered. Did you notify the family? I did. How did they take it? They were relieved. I can imagine. Thank you for notifying me, Detective. Of course. How do you know Viggo Larsen? He's a client of mine. From what case? Not from this office. From my other practice. And what's that? I do healing. Different kinds of energy work. "Healing the Hunter." Getting to the root of violence. Why's he seeing you? You're well aware that I can't answer that question, not without written consent. Sorry. When's the last time you saw him? I'd have to check my records. It's been a while. That's interesting. Because that's a photo of you leaving his vehicle yesterday. Hmm. That's you, right? Seems to be. You know lying to an officer is obstruction of justice. I'm well aware of how the justice system works, Detective. I believe that Viggo Larsen is responsible for the death of Zack Thomas. Interesting. Based on what? Evidence. But what is this really about? What's he like? Who? Viggo. I believe him to be a man capable of greatness. Like killing a child molester? That depends on how he sees it. But you'll have to ask him that. -Thanks for your time. -Of course. (phone buzzes) Hey. DIANA: A Detective Jones just came to my work. Yeah. He seems to know everything. I'll keep you safe. I love you. (laughing) Hey, Martin, how you doing? I'm good. Damian here? No, he is not. Well, he told me to come meet him. Yeah, I know. He said to meet him at the little strip mall by the house. Hold on, man. My daughter just got her first phone. She won't stop texting, it's driving me crazy. Tell her you're busy. I'm not going to lie to her. Take a picture of me... to text. Thanks. All right. Here's the key. Alarm system? It's taken care of. This is a nice neighborhood. What'd she do? It's complicated. Don't worry about it. She'll be gone in seven seconds. Let me know how it goes. (TV plays in distance) (latch clicks) (TV continues) (click) (Spanish guitar on TV) (coughing in distance) (screaming on TV) (cricket chirping) (gasps) (panting) (retching) (vomits) (gun clicking) (vacuum whirring in distance) Viggo. I'm not here to arrest you. I want to talk to you. There's a diner around the corner. I'm gonna sit there and wait for you. Please. I know you killed Zack Thomas. He the only one? I do what you do. You ride horses too? I killed a woman the other night. And after I was finished, I walked around her house and looked at her kids. I didn't feel anything. Not guilt. Or remorse. -I just felt-- -Empty. Yeah. Is that how you feel? No. Is it just pedophiles? How old are you? -Thirty. -Thirty. And already working Homicide? I'm just on loan-out from the station. Either way, good for you. Is Phil Duncan still there? I haven't heard the name. Ahh... It was a long time ago. So, do you like the job? I've only been there a few months. You think you're good at it? Yeah. I think I could be. You gotta run? No. I can sit here a while. You? No. I've got time. (swallows) ♪♪ (ends)
