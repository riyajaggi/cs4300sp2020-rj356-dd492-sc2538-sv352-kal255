 Because we're not just a cartel. We're a fucking soccer team. We'll practice, practice, practice! Until we can win every time! And if not... ...it's very simple. I'll kill your family. Good morning, my beautiful Yaritza. Are you laughing? What were we talking about? You were talking about Pele.

 Pele! The greatest soccer player of all time! We were just kids back then. We snuck into the stadium... ...just to see Pele play. Pass me the milk. Why are you speaking English? I'm sorry, Don Ricardo. Forgive me. You must practice your Spanish, Jesus. Always! I'm... improving. That's very good! Anyway - Pele!

 It was Mexico against Brazil. Me and my sister... Your mother. ...we had to sneak into the stadium to see him. It took us two hours just to walk there! And Pele scored from the center circle! Coffee, quick. What are you doing, Miguel? Drinking coffee. Clean yourself up before joining your family at breakfast. It's just coffee. It doesn't matter! I'm sorry, my dears. I don't mean to yell on this sacred day. But my son here... ...is acting like a peasant. He got that from his mother. Magdalena warned me about her. I didn't listen. It's okay. It's not okay. It's not okay. On your mother's birthday... No one should behave like this. Please accept my apologies. How are you holding up today, Jesus? Are you alright? Yes. Good... you're a good boy. He's a good boy. Let's go and wish my sister a happy birthday. And you. Go check out the satellite dish. The TV isn't working. Right now? Yes, right now. I apologize. Forgive me. Get me some eggs. The spirit of Magdalena... ...is all around us. Happy birthday, dear sister. Today would have been your forty-seventh birthday. Each year brought you more beauty. More magic. I loved you more than anyone else. You know this. Go ahead... Tell her whatever you want to say. Open your heart to her. Offer her your hand. Let her comfort you. She sees you. She sees the man you're becoming. She gives you her blessing. It's not the satellite. What? The satellite dish is fine. Can't you see we're speaking to your aunt? Why are you always such an embarrassment to me? I'm trying to fix your problem. Well do it later! Get gone. An embarrassment. On a day like this. Please... sit over here. Listen to what I'm going to tell you Jesus. When you meet Captain Cortez today... ...he will seem like a good man. But he isn't. His police force was once an army. And our war with them cost many lives. Right now there is a truce. And we pay them very well for peace. But my son, Miguel... ...doesn't agree with me on this. He always wants everything to be a fight. But this truce... ...is very good for our business. And I'm quite sure that you... ...you understand that. There's more money to be made in peace. Sorry to keep you waiting. My bowels are acting up. Comfortable, are you? That's my throne. Your throne is too small for me. I have some good news for you, Miguel. Are you ready? Sure. Really? Just tell me, Cortez. I know who's been stealing your women. Good news or what? Could be. If you give me some specifics. We don't know exactly who it is yet. But I know for sure... ...it's not another cartel. We think it's a local vigilante. A vigilante killed four of our soldiers? Looks like it. At least we know what we're looking for. Good news, no? Good news, Cortez? I'm deducting a thousand dollars a week until you bring me this vigilante. I don't think your father would be okay with that. You're welcome to talk to him about it. I will. Go ahead. Tell him your great "news". I'm sure he'll be very impressed. Okay, okay. There's no need to get angry. The game is tomorrow, remember? Let's keep the aggression... on the field. You haven't seen our new goalie. He's from Brazil. We're going to take you down this year. We're going to crush you. Oh yeah? Then let's increase the bet. You could win some of your money back. I mean, your father's money. Sure. Let's double it. Ten thousand dollars. Fine. Can you afford that? It doesn't matter. We won't lose. But you've never won. I have faith. Faith? Okay. Ten thousand dollars. We'll even throw in... ...three whores. But they might be fat. Oh yeah? - That's even better! Pablo likes fat women. You're all degenerates. I'm not shaking that hand. Then how do we seal the bet? With a drink. Two glasses. Clean. Pablo bring us the bottle. This is from Jalisco. Arandas, where my father was from. It'll put hair on your chest. Cheers, Captain. And now you're plastered. Let's have another. Listen. How about a little cocaine? Not right now. Come on... Leave it out though. You got it. Fuck. Your boss is a tough businessman. He's not my boss. He's my little cousin. Come on... one more. To celebrate. How many whores again? Three. And fat. So you're the American Prince. Jesus doesn't speak Spanish. Pleasure to meet you. I knew your mother. We were all children together. Back before the wars. I liked her very much. So what do you think of Mexico? - It's the future. Really? Why do you say that? - Because there's no law out here. - Only survival. That's very perceptive of you. Will I see you on the field tomorrow? - I don't play soccer. You don't play? No, he doesn't. Are you sure he's part of your family? No. But my father swears he is. So he doesn't play! Find me this vigilante, Cortez. Come on, princess. Let's get out of here. Hey, Gato... Have you heard about a vigilante around here? No... why? Cortez claims a vigilante is stealing our women. And killing our men? I don't believe it. Why not? He's a cop. No good person ever becomes a cop. You can't trust any of them. It's Cortez who's doing it. I know it. What's more... I bet they're fucking our women for free... ...in a fucking cave. We should take them out. That's fine with me. But my father made a truce with them. And until he's dead and gone... ...there's nothing I can do. Maybe... but he's not going to be around much longer. Be careful. I just mean that you'll be the Don soon. I don't mean any disrespect. I don't care what you mean. If he heard you... ...he'd have your whole family killed. He's the same son of a bitch he always was. I understand... relax. But when the time comes... ...remember. I'm your man. Your bodyguard. It'll be Chuqui and Gato... ...getting all the pussy and drugs. That sounds good. And no more deals with cops. That sounds even better. You wanna go to the club and get high? We're going to get crazy. Yeah. Let's go. "To the victims' families who were saved by the High Priestess of Death." I like it. The moment I saw that jacket... ...I thought of you. Yaritza. How can I repay you? There are... ...many ways you can do that. But tonight... I am interested to see... ...what the tarot cards say... ...about my future. What do you want to know? I'm worried about Miguel. Why? Will he grow into a great leader... ...after my death? Flip the cards over. This is the sound of peace. Look around you. What do you see? Everything here... ...this is what peace looks like. The police versus the cartel. Together, playing soccer. They wear blue. We wear red... ...the color of our land. No weapons are allowed. No one is allowed to kill anyone. We play a clean game. As it should be. Just like Pele did. Good afternoon. Don Ricardo. Permit me to express my thanks for hosting this game. And maintaining peace in our beautiful village. It's an honor to consider you a friend. Do you know my nephew Jesus? Yes, we met. I told him I knew his mother. We call him the 'American Prince'! In honor of her. That's very nice to hear. I just wanted to pay my respects... ...and wish you luck in the game. Yes, good luck to us all. With your permission... Look at this. The filthy peasant can't even keep his hands clean. Miguel lost. My son... ...a failure. How so? I tried to show him how to be a man. He still turned out a faggot. My boy... take me back to my room. Do you feel sick? I just need a fresh shirt. What happened? This shit spilled out. Do you want me to get the nurse? She left. Yaritza scared her off. Bring the tray with the medications. Put those gloves on. Take that bag over there... ...and put this inside. Now. Use that spray... ...and clean me up. I found her in the desert. Yaritza. She appeared out of nowhere. Out of the dust. Alone. Naked. As if she'd been waiting for me. She seemed ageless. She was so beautiful. Delicate. Like a butterfly. Her scent reminded me of your mother. Even now when I look into Yaritza's eyes... ...I feel my sister looking back at me. I feel the same when I look at you... ...my son. You have my hands. My eyes. My mouth. I see myself. Magdalena... My boy. I know you're unhappy. But you did well today. Playing the game is the only thing that matters. Not winning. When my sister and I were very young... ...we snuck into the stadium... ...to watch Mexico play Brazil. We saw Pele. He was like... ...a god. Put that down. He's sleeping. Then we sit here and wait... ...until he wakes up. Put it down. He kicked a goal... ...from the center of the field. The goalie never saw it coming. It was amazing. That night, we walked home shouting... "I'm Pele!" "No! I'm Pele!!!" I told her... "But a girl can't be Pele!" But she didn't care. She just wanted to play. That's what I want to tell you my son. There's no shame... ...in just playing. He's sleeping. Sit down! No one moves from this table. Shut your mouth. Don't touch him. Is that how you show your fucking respect? Get out. What was that look? You got something to say? Say it to my face, asshole! What are you trying to say, asshole? Tell me! What do you want to say, fucker? I'm sorry. He was a great man. - It's kind of you to come. Of course. He and I were friends. I hope that from now on... ...you and I can continue this friendship. Don Miguel. In the spirit of your father's wishes. Very well. I'm sorry for your loss. What happens now? A three day party. To mourn the death of your uncle. And to celebrate Miguel's ascent to the throne. Why three days? For our souls. And to discover... ...which way our new king will take us. When we're done with this girl... ...we'll sell her to a gang in the next town. Gato knows where it is. Where is the girl? She's in the car. Leave the money inside. Sure thing. Come on sweetie, get out of the car. Welcome to your new home. What's up? Go. But don't go home. - Why are you helping me? I'm The High Priestess of Death. I hated you. I resented you so much. Magdalena's son. In the United States. My father talked about you all the time. It's always been that way. Even when my mom was dying... ...he'd cry over a photograph of Magdalena. That's now in the past. You really want to be brothers? I'll prepare you. For war. It starts today.
