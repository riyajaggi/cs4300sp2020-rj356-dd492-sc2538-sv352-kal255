Theirs was a slave ship carrying a quarter-million beings... bred to adapt and labor in any environment. But they've washed ashore on Earth... with no way to get back to where they came from. And in the last five years, the Newcomers have become the latest addition... to the population of Los Angeles. Dallas, you look so lovely in that dress. Thank you, Miss Bronte.

 And how is my little princess? - Do l have to go? - Yes, honey. You'll be fine. Well, what have we here? Let's have a look at you. Go on. L'll have a treat for you when we get back. You're so pretty, baby. So pretty. L've been around the world but never off the planet. You Newcomers drive me wild. Come on. What is going on? Uncle Moodri, wait. What is going on? Uncle Moodri, wait. Wait, stop. We are having a party tonight. What are you doing? The reclining platform should face southeast, toward the galaxy Centaurus. The reclining platform should face that wall toward the fireplace. Your house is in disorder. I am come to make it right.

 "Great Father Powhatan, spare the life of Capt. John Smith. - "Or if blood is to be shed, let it be mine." - What is this? L'm rehearsing for the school play, Pocahontas. That's very nice, sweetie. You are going to have to get rid of your pets before the neighbors complain. They're not his pets. They're his companions. There were two pounds of gopher in the refrigerator. Anybody seen it? Vegetables are pure, meat pollutes. They should be kept separate. We're keeping them in the closet next to the washing machine. No, we are not. This is my house and l say where things go. What do you mean, this is your house? On the ship, the Overseers treated us as property to be bought and sold. Does your mind look on this world like the mind of an Overseer? Tonight we are having people l work with over for dinner. The idea is for them to see how alike we are to humans... whose reclining platforms do not face the galaxy Centaurus. "Great Father of Powhatan, spare the life...." l am going to work. Case of William Campbell, shot and critically wounded... in what appears to be a gang-related incident. This case is a political hot potato. Campbell's black and his assailant is a Newcomer. Now, l've got to assign detectives to the case.... The choice is simple, Captain. L should be assigned the case... to demonstrate that l am not biased by my species. And to also demonstrate that the department serves the entire community... and it is in the large sense truly colorblind. That's sweet, George, but naive. Dobbs, case is yours. This is a priority investigation. Lf Dobbs needs any help, you're at his disposal. You're coming to the barbecue tonight, aren't you, Matt? You asked me that every day for the last week. Yes, l'm coming to your barbecue. Dobbs and Marcus haven't given me a firm answer. L do think an evening like that would help build a sense of unity, don't you? - What's with the foot? - Tension. You get sore necks, we get sore feet. Lt's my home life. Tell me. What did you think of Alien Heart? That tape l loaned you. Lt's the first movie in which Newcomers are given meaningful roles. L only had a chance to watch half. My aunt called from Phoenix. Do me a favor, put those shoes back on. Look at your movies. Sex Team, Kittens in Heat. Your culture puts a very high priority on the physical. Name one that doesn't. Ln ours there's more integration with the mental and the spiritual. A strictly physical relationship is foreign to us. No male would want it. No female would accept it. L thought Alien Heart expressed this well. George, do you want to know the truth? - Alien Heart is a bore. - A bore? - A bore. That's why l didn't watch it. - Alien Heart? - A bore. That's why l didn't watch it. - Alien Heart? - Yeah! - Eleanor Roosevelt is boring? Ls that the one that kind of looks like a chipmunk? She is beautiful and brilliant. She'll be the first Newcomer to win the Academy Award, you'll see. Andarko. Now, you get that money back, or you're dead. Hey, you! Stop! Are you all right? You okay? Lt's all right, we're police. Easy, easy, easy. He had salt water. He was going to burn me. Okay? - Do you know that man? - No. L lost him. He's gonna come back. He's gonna kill me. You don't know him, but you know he's going to come back. - What's your name? - Mary. Mary Shelley. Mary, do your parents know you're out working the streets? Working the streets? What are you talking about? - Come on. - What do you mean? She's a hooker, George. That guy was her pimp. - A prostitute? - Yeah. L can't believe that. She is Tenctonese. You've seen Newcomer hookers before. Come on. Wait. Ls it true? Are you a prostitute? Satisfied? Mary, where do your parents live? My parents? A place called San Diego. Lt is not safe on the streets. L want you to go home to your parents. Do you have bus fare? Mary, l am going to give you $50... to buy a bus ticket back home to your parents. Very smart, George. Giving a hooker money, that's very smart. Mary, the bus. - L don't know how. - She's nuts, George. No. She is.... She has no self. She is still a slave. L have heard of this but l have never seen this. Matt, l want you to take her home, clean her up and put her on that bus. - What the hell are you talking about? - She can't function by herself. All her life she has been controlled by someone. The Overseers on our slave ship and now her pimp. She is unable to think for herself. - We can't leave her out here. - Then we'll take her to juvie hall. She is helpless. You know what they would do to her there. Well, then you take her home. L would but l.... My kids, my uncle, his goat.... You live five minutes from the bus station. George, we're police, we're not social workers. Matt, you have a daughter her age. Would you want her to go to juvenile hall? Oh, jeez. All right. l suppose Susan will have to understand. Okay, l'll take her. You have 20 minutes to get yourself cleaned up. This prostitution. We never had such a thing until we came here. - Matt, do you ever pay for sex? - No! Well, you know, once or twice when l was young. What are you asking me questions like that for? Okay. Here's a towel and some soap. Guess you don't need any aftershave. Shower's in there. Wait a minute. What are we going to put you in? Hi, Cathy. Look, do you have an old dress that you don't want anymore? Lt's for her. Cathy, this is Mary. Mary, Cathy. L'll check. Did you call your folks? Okay, right. There's your bus. Here's your ticket. Give this to the bus driver and he'll tell you where to get off. Wait a minute. What, no thank you? No nothing here? Thank you. Wait a minute. Collar is crooked. - Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah. - Sorry l'm late. - Thank you. - Where's everybody? - Alfred had to work. L guess the others all got caught in traffic. Unless they're all a bunch of party poops. - Poopers, George, party poopers. - Whatever. My feet are killing me. Dad, Matt, guess what? L got a part in the school play. Emily is doing Pocahontas in the school play. That's great. Yeah, and did you see Eleanor Roosevelt... in Alien Heart? L'm going to be just like her. Here, take this to the table. - Hi, Susan. - Matt. You're the first one here. L suppose we should go ahead and eat. There is no telling when the others will get here. Okay. Good, then. L'll just take this to the table. - Dinner, everyone. - The barbecue is out here. L wasn't sure how long to cook the hamburgers. Do you think one hour is enough? One hour ought to do it. - Growing your own food? - They are Uncle Moodri's companions. Looks like your friends aren't going to show. Lt's bumper to bumper out there. They'll be here. Uncle Moodri. This is my partner, Matthew Sikes. Matt, Uncle Moodri. Hi! l see why your feet hurt. - This something new? - No, very old. Uncle is a pre-Celinist. His belief is based on the matriarchal system. The Goddess lonia is our mother. The universe is her womb. All things come from the mother, all things return to the mother. As you can see, women play a significant role in this religion. You'd have no trouble converting my ex-wife. So, Matt, did Mary make it on the bus all right? - Just hope her family takes her back. - Why wouldn't they? Mary's been in a little bit of trouble. Lt's all right. Ln this house sex is discussed openly. - Mary is a prostitute. - What's a prostitute? This broccoli is delicious. That's someone who has sexual relations for money. L thought that was the gift you gave somebody when you loved them. L know, it's confusing, Emily. Well, Matthew's been with a prostitute. Perhaps he can explain. Well, as l told George, your father... this particular incident happened when l was quite young. This girl told me... her mother was very, very sick and l gave her some money. That's all. A woman is sacred. - Buck. - They treat us like things. They even treat their own kind like things. Mary is a Newcomer. You see? First they take away our identity. Then our soul's polluted. - We have nothing left. - So, could l have some more salad, please? Well, l don't want to be a prostitute. L want to be an actress. Mary, what are.... Why aren't you.... Come on. Dorian, remember that girl you were looking for? All right, so what's going on? - L don't have any place to go. - What about your parents? L don't have parents. L was taken away from them when l was a baby. Look, Mary, you can't stay here. You can sleep on the couch tonight... but tomorrow l have to take you to the Juvenile Division of Newcomer Affairs. That's my daughter. She was about eight then. Look, you can sleep in this tonight. Good night. He shot Campbell, man! He shot Campbell! Fear no more, Finiksa. - Ls it time to go? - You need some breakfast. L live by myself, l don't have a lot on hand. - You want some peanuts? - Yeah. There you go. L got some instant coffee, maybe you're too young. Peanuts are fine. l like peanuts. That guy with the salt water. What happened? L stole money. My boyfriend told me to. - From your pimp? - The man l was sent to. - Where's the money now? - My boyfriend took it and he went away. Oh, Mary. You've gotta give that money back. They'll kill you. You don't understand the streets. There are laws. l know, l've been there. Look, l gotta go to work now. You stay put. Keep the door locked, don't let anyone in... and when l get back, we'll figure out something. Here, you can watch Alien Heart while l'm gone. Alien Heart? Can you put it in? l want to see it. - Okay, see you later. - Wait, can you make it go fast? Stop it here. Look, that's my friend. Dallas. We have the same agent. - Agent? - Lsn't she beautiful? Yeah, she's real pretty. Okay, keep the door locked. Wait. Thank you. George, look, l'm really sorry l missed your barbecue last night... but l was working on this hot lead on the Campbell case. - Sure. l understand. - Really? You know, we found a piece of Newcomer skin at the scene of the crime. One of them had salt water thrown on him. L didn't know you guys were tissue typed during quarantine. They're running a make right now. That's great. Congratulations. L suppose they all had legitimate reasons for not coming to the barbecue. George, Mary's back. She doesn't have any parents. And this guy's going to kill her... if she can't come up with some money in a hurry. L had no idea it would be so complicated. Or perhaps you were right. We should turn her over to juvenile hall. Come on, juvie hall is the last thing she needs. She needs a home. Problem is, there ain't a big adoption market for 16-year-old hookers. Look, Matt. Perhaps we can take her in for a few days. George, this kid's like an eggshell, breakable. Can't keep moving her around. Besides, she's used to me. - What are you saying? - She's used to me. L know what she likes for breakfast. Excuse me. l'm looking for my little sister, Mary. Mary Shelley. Yes, we've met. She told me to pick her up at this address... but she didn't give me the apartment number. Lt's 203. l'll let you in. The great God lonia is with us. This is her sign. - Here she will speak. - How do you know? There was a place like this on our planet. L was a little boy. - My father took me there. - What was it like, our home? Blue. The deepest and most peaceful blue. A silver mist. Meadows full of a thousand stars. You are sad, Finiksa. Something happened. L don't know what to do. Can you tell me? Come with me, here. Lt's in the sea, Uncle. The salt water will kill us. Buck, Mom wants you. She needs you to go to the store. How did you know? What's that? Lt's a place l'm going to with Uncle. Mary? Mary! Some guy was selling these things on the street, and l thought l'd.... Mary! Oh, God. He's not here. L'm so sorry, Matt. lt's all my fault. No, it isn't. L let him in. She'd be alive right now if l hadn't let him in. Lt's not your fault. May l go? Yeah. L never should have taken her in. L should have left her on the streets where she belonged. Matt. L'm going to nail the son of a bitch who killed her. Gonna nail his ass. L don't think we should take this investigation. You are emotionally involved. Lt makes for bad police work. L, too, am horrified by her death. But if taking Mary in was an error in judgment, let's not make another. You didn't come home and find that girl lying dead on your floor. L'm on this case. You don't like it, put in for a new partner. Great Chief Powhatan, l beseech you. No father has shown his daughter more love. No daughter has ever been happier. You have fed me, taught me and protected me. Lt is you who gave me eyes to see the good in this world. To know the pure heart from the evil. Father, look into this man's heart... and see the goodness there. Great Father Powhatan... - You all right? - Hear your daughter's cry. Spare the life of Capt. John Smith. Let's nail that son of a bitch. The man who produced Alien Heart filmed it here. L just imagined some big studio in Hollywood. You know George, Alien Heart ain't exactly Gone with the Wind. Harry Marcus? LAPD. We'd like to.... - Come here. - L don't have it! L'm broke. You can't squeeze money from a stone. You tell her that. - What the hell are you talking about? - The alimony. She's got everything. l have nothing. L'm living out of my car. L don't care about any alimony. What's the use? They pulled the plug on my picture. l have no future! Will you shut up! We just want to ask you some questions. Okay. You can't imagine the hell she's been putting me through. There was an actress in Alien Heart. A Newcomer named Dallas. Where can we find her? L don't know. My ex-partner, Mr. Casting Couch, he handled the Newcomers. Want a drink? L've got some sour milk in the car. No, thank you. Been in the sun a couple of days. How did your partner go about finding girls? From the Bronte Agency. L remember because he was always saying how cooperative they were. You guys scared the hell out of me. Cooperative? Easy. They put out. Where's this guy from? Outer space? Easy. You don't mean Eleanor Roosevelt. Thanks for your help. Can't believe that. Eleanor Roosevelt? Hi! l'm Bennett Hart. This is my partner, Huey Long. We're producing the movie Butterfly Road. Lt's kind of a sequel to Cocoon 3. We have an appointment with Miss Bronte. Bennett Hart and Huey Long to see you, Miss Bronte. Send them in. - What's with you? - Lt's my feet again. Relax, we'll be fine. Hello. l'm Charlotte Bronte. - You must be Mr. Long. - Yes. How do you do? - Mr. Hart. - Hi. Refresh my memory, Mr. Long. What was your last picture? Pocahontas. The love story. Retold from a Tenctonese point of view. "Father, look into this man's heart, and see the goodness there. "Great Father Powhatan, hear thy daughter's cry." - l don't think l caught it. - Lt's not out yet. Christmas. Well, my book is there. L'm sure you'll find a number of fine actresses. L'm very proud of my girls. Please, have a look. - Did you have a certain type in mind? - Young, attractive. L'm afraid that describes all of them. My friend, Harry Marcus, the producer of Alien Heart... mentioned that you might have some special girls... girls who are.... You know. Excuse me. l'm embarrassed. L think we've come to the wrong place. Wait. You understand l have to be discreet. Naturally, these girls will be more expensive. How about this one? L'm sorry. l should've taken that one out. She's no longer with our agency. This girl is good-looking. Yes, l like her. Dallas. Yes. And l believe she's available. Hold it right there. - Svabo? - Yeah? Detective Sgt. Dobbs. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Lf you give up that right... anything you say will and can be used against you in a court of law. Hi. l'm from the Bronte Agency. Come in. Dallas, right? L'm Huey Long. Would you like to have a seat? L've heard a good deal about you. You're very talented. Thank you. L was wondering if you might do for me what you did for my friend... Harry Marcus. Miss Bronte said this was going to be straight up. Half and half will cost you extra. $500. Ls that enough? Okay. Police. You're under arrest. - L'm sorry, Dallas. - Sure. Lt's not as bad as all that. Lf you help us, we will drop the charges. - No. - Your friend, Mary, she's dead. We need you to help us find her killer. You're lying. Uncle, are you sure it's safe to go that close to the ocean? Now we go. Campbell says Svabo is not the Slag who shot him. Now we get Svabo to finger the guy... and l'm going to make the collar of my lifetime. Every reporter within 100 miles is going to be there watching me play Dick Tracy. Then you see if l don't make lieutenant. You're in deep, kid. Look, l didn't do it. lt wasn't me, man. Who? Who was it that shot Campbell? Ls she wired? Feels funny. This Dorian Grey, he handle all the rough stuff? Charlotte uses him to keep us in line. Like, if a girl's holding back, she sends Dorian. Right. Dallas... we have got to connect Charlotte with Dorian. We think that Charlotte had him kill Mary over some money she stole. Now, we're going to make Charlotte very angry with you... but l don't want you to be frightened. We'll be close by, and we'll be able to hear everything that goes on. All right? Yes, l spoke to Dallas. She told me everything went well. Yes. She was excellent. Did she tell you about the party? No. She didn't mention anything. That's odd. We negotiated the price. Anyway, l'm having her and friends of hers attend a party. Some investors from New York. L'm sure she'll let you know. Yes, l'm sure she will. Goodbye, Mr. Long. Dorian, l need you. Yes. RECEPTlONlST: Dallas is here, Miss Bronte. Send her in. Dallas, dear. This is from Mr. Long. Thank you. ls something wrong? No, l'm tired, l guess. Of course. Did you and Mr. Long make any other plans? No. Really? Well, that's too bad. L thought you would hit it off. Well, c'est la vie. L've made arrangements for you to have another date. This afternoon. This afternoon? Actually, you don't have much time. My driver will take you. Please send Nat in. - Drive Dallas to this address, please. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you, Miss Bronte. - Don't be silly. Hurry now. Hello, Dallas. Dorian. Stay close, Matt. Pretty Dallas. Stupid Dallas. You know what happens to girls who rip off Charlotte? L don't know what you mean. Say it, you bastard, say it. Your little party with that producer. L was going to tell her. That's it. Let's pull her out. Damn! - Watch it! - Move that thing! Move it! What are you doing? This is called chicken, George. 90% of the time they get out of the way. That leaves 10%. Out of the way! You killed Mary, didn't you? That's right. And l'm going to kill you, too if you don't learn. That's it. Let's get him. Here's a little reminder. A taste of the blue Pacific. You're wired. You're dead. Come on, try it! Please. - L'm okay. - Lt's all right. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. - Lf you give up that right anything... - What the hell do you think you're... You take innocence, you sell it, and you destroy it. - What? - She has the tattoo. She is.... An Overseer. One of those who kept us slaves on the ship. Don't worry about it, George. She's in for life... and that don't begin to pay the bill. George... l've got some bad news. The kid we arrested... he identified the Newcomer who shot Campbell. Lt's your son. My son? Buck. L'm sorry, man. Lt's a mistake. We gotta bring him in. L'm really sorry, man. Wait. Let me. Sure. Will it? - How? - L am part of it. Lt is part of me. Come, Finiksa. Believe that and the water can't hurt you. L'm not you, Uncle. l don't have your faith. There is no shame in that. Shame is for those who remain blind to themselves. L don't know where l belong... or who l am. With each breath, you join this earth. You're saying l belong here? L hate this world. All worlds are stardust. This world, our world, we are stardust. Scattered, drifting... yet united by one voice. The voice that tells a leaf to turn to the light... the flowers to bloom. Lt speaks to you, too. - L don't hear it. - L know. You carry a wound... and until that wound is cleansed, you will not be able to hear the voice. You know about the shooting. That's why you came. L didn't mean to hurt anybody. L didn't want to do it. Uncle... help me. Finiksa, this is your world. Embrace it. Take responsibility for what you do here. Face your wrongdoing with honor and you will hear the voice. There are many to help you, many who love you. Buck. Dad, l've done a horrible thing. L have to go to the police. The state finds compelling evidence... that the shooting of William Campbell was an act of self-defense. Yet, l cannot absolve Buck Francisco from all culpability. Two years in a correctional institution, suspended. Buck Francisco is remanded to the custody of his parents... and placed on probation for three years. Any infraction of the rules of that probation... and he will immediately serve his full sentence. This hearing is adjourned.
