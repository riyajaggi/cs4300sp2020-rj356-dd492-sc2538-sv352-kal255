Theirs was a slave ship, carrying a quarter-million beings... bred to adapt and labor in any environment. But they've washed ashore on Earth... with no way to get back to where they came from. And in the last five years, the Newcomers have become the latest addition... to the population of Los Angeles. The money is the deal. Mr. Charles, please, l can get you the money.

 Garrison, you're a loser. Lf l let you off easy, people're gonna think of me as a loser. That's unacceptable. When l get the back door covered, we move. Come on Mr. Charles. You know l'm good for the money. That isn't the point. lt's too late. Mr. Charles, please. L just need a week, that's all. This is a waste of time. Please, give me a chance. Scotty, l'm sorry, l got a business to run. And you're a liability. Freeze, police! What you're describing is first-degree murder. L'm describing what l saw.

 My client, Mr. Charles, will testify Garrison pulled the gun on him. A struggle ensued, the pistol accidentally discharged. That's not what happened. You'd better come up with something to substantiate your client's fantasy... Jeff, or l'll nail him the minute we get a jury. Why would Chester Charles, a respected businessman... Oh, please. He fronts an import business that runs everything from guns to dirty drug money. L don't believe any charges have been filed on those allegations. We're working on it. L suggest you work on coming up with a reason... my client, suddenly, without provocation, allegedly... pulled a weapon and gunned down his associate. - He said Garrison was bad for business. - He said? You heard their conversation 200 feet away? Officer Rankin, the bald-headed gentleman in the corner... has just asked his partner, Officer Jennings for a cup of coffee. No sugar. "And... "Jen, toss me a booking slip on the way." They're a little keener with the senses than we are. That's all. Gentlemen, we'll see you in court. Good work, Francisco. We got a trial date yet, Anderson? Yeah, jury selection begins next week. Okay, l'll loosen up Francisco's calendar. This should work out nicely considering your condition. L'm due to accept a pod any day, now. Congratulations. l didn't know you and Susan were pregnant. Oh yes, we're very excited. - You look great. - Thank you. Must be a female, huh? Yeah, okay. That's all, gentlemen. - George, you got a minute? - Yes, of course. - You know city attorney Bud Anderson. - Yeah, hi. - How did the deposition go? - As expected. George's testimony should put Charles away for a long time. All right. Knock 'em dead, George. You write that down. That's another useful expression. lt means, to do a good job. Nice meeting you, Bud. L really need to talk to my partner. Yes, of course. - Thanks again. And congratulations. - Thank you. "Knock 'em dead." A little violent, but has a nice thing to it. "Ring." So, George, this trip to the ejection center.... Yeah, Susan will be here any minute. - Yeah, you really think l should be there? - Of course. Godfather. Yeah, now, there's another thing we need to talk about. Yes, that's a good idea. Susan and l very much want to embrace the Earthly tradition but... we were quite troubled when we read the book. The book? You read The Godfather? We thought they carried the concept of an honorable guardian a bit too far. Yeah, l'm not really into dead fish and horse's heads. Susan will be relieved to hear that. She was having doubts about having a godfather. Well, now, let's not drop that idea. - Hi. Ready to go? - All set. - Did you ask about the.... - Yes. No dead fish, no offers that can't be refused. Well, shall we, godfather? Lt's so peaceful. Well, this is it, Matthew. This is one hell of a lobby. This is where we're going to transfer our pod. You can't have a baby in a lobby. - How are we doing? - Lt's perfect. L also have an Oasis or a Great Plains available. No. No need to look any further. This is perfect. - This is an ejection room? - Lsn't it wonderful? Yeah, l'll get the marshmallows and weenies. The environment is very important for the ejection of the pod. This space gives us the tranquility necessary to focus on our delivery. What are you going to do? Roll in the dirt? Well, l hope we'll use the ejection cradle. Several pods have been quite peacefully transferred, from right here. George, it's wonderful. We'll trim the trees... and make sure all the animals are fed and have everything ready to go. - Your two children will be attending? - Yes. Mr. Sikes? L don't know. L think we got a problem here or something. Lt's contractions. George, cut it out. We are biologically in sync. L'm experiencing the same as Susan. Look George, are you gonna be having these cramps a lot? Because that was really embarrassing in the weapons locker. That was just the pod rotating for ejection. L shouldn't have any more embarrassing moments until after the ejection. What happens then? Guess who or l'll blow your socks off. Lt couldn't be an old cop with two bum knees? L prefer "seasoned" to "old." - Theo, how are you? - How do l look? Seasoned. Hey, George Francisco... l want you to meet the guy who taught me everything l know about being a cop. - Theo Miles. - Yeah, somebody had to break in the rook. The guys drew straws and l lost. - What are you doing around here? - Haven't you seen the memo? - What? - The mass drug crackdown. Memo 62785. Yes, of course. An interdivisional program... to coordinate individual drug arrests into a joint super-prosecution. Yeah, 62785. Yeah, l've been popping into divisions all over town... getting the best men hitting the hottest leads. Got a nice little one down here. You interested? Sounds like another job for the canines! You'll love this, George. This is great. L was still in uniform, and l get stuck with this guy in an alley. The big hotshot detective. We had six armed punks cornered, waiting for backup. And they were ready to make a break... - when Sikes started barking like a dog. - Me? You started it. L was just following the detective's lead. Damned if it didn't fool them long enough for backups to arrive. Those idiots. They were more afraid of dogs than cops. Say, what do you say? You in on this bust? This guy never changes. Hey George, come on. You're not gonna bust anybody standing around your desk. - Ls he okay? - Yeah. He's just expecting. Let's go. RlCKMAN: How's it going, Haney? - Did it go okay? - Piece of cake. Check it out. 100% pure. One ounce cuts a 1,000 times. We got ourself a gold mine. Police! Everybody take it easy and keep your hands up. Freeze. Haney. L got a bad feeling. Theo. You're as crazy as ever. The guy would have hammered you. L didn't see you moving. L was following your lead. My knee locked on me. L was waiting for you to push me out of the way like l taught you. - Are you two all right? - L forgot about your knee. L don't tell you these things for nothing. By the way, did l tell you l'm retiring? You're throwing me a party. The briefcase is clean. Lt's already weighed. Here's the receipt. You mind putting a seal on it and drop it off in the evidence room? Yes, of course. While you're at it, why don't you drop off that scale, too? - Are you coming? - You mind if l borrow this guy? We've got some old times to catch up on. L need the weighing receipt. Right here. - That's not right. - No, you're seven grams short. Where did it go? Lt's probably just the scales. L'll have them calibrated. Hey. lt happens all the time. Just relax. Well, l can't believe that Theo Miles is hanging up his badge. Ten days and it goes in a box with my Eagle Scout uniform. - You excited? - Hell, l don't know. - You look good, Theo. - Give me a break. L look like a guy who's had 35 years with bullets flying at him... a couple of marriages that cleaned the bank... and a nice long affair with Miss Wallop here. So, what are you gonna do? So, what are you gonna do? You stay in the same place too long, somebody's going to shoot you. - Same old Miles. - Look, kid, l've taught you a lot. How to make it on the streets. How to dance around the bureaucratic crap. Hell, l even taught you how to live. Don't make the same mistakes l made. What mistakes? - Don't let 35 years jump on top of you. - L promise. You're a good kid. Got to tell you... best rook l ever trained. Get out of here. Would l lie to the best man at my third wedding? L was just the best man 'cause your brother didn't show up. That's just the story l told you. L don't have a brother. Lf you knew that, you would have ducked out on me. You really don't have a brother? What are you doing? Twisting my nipples. Come on, George, l got to work with you. My nipples need strengthening for the attachment. So you can play with them in the john. L'm sorry if l'm embarrassing you. Francisco. ln here, now. See. l'm not the only one against public nipple-twisting. George Francisco, Sgt. Dustin Baxley, lnternal Affairs. - Lt's nice to meet you. - L'm afraid, this isn't a pleasure call. There's a seven-gram discrepancy in the weight from yesterday's seizure. Yes. l pointed that out to the officer. We recalibrated both scales and they match. What does that mean? That $300,000 worth of jack disappeared... between the crime scene and the police station. Where did it go? L'm afraid this is a very serious matter, George. Until investigation is completed, you're confined to desk duty. George. - Neemu, are you all right? - L'm fine. l just couldn't sleep. You feeling okay? Yes. l must have had a contraction or something and woke up. We haven't had a contraction all night. L told the kids about the ejection center. They're very excited. Lt will be wonderful. Susan, you should go up to bed. Susan, please, just let me work this out. Everything will be fine. l promise. Well, then hold me. Hey, Bobby. Thanks for the doughnut. - No one gave me a doughnut. - You want one? He put three in my locker. No, l don't want one. Did you see that? Jenkins didn't even say hello to me. He always says hello to me. He was reading a file. What's with the paranoia rush? L'm not being paranoid. L'm just being given the cold soldier. Lt's "shoulder." And no, you're not. Look, by tonight, they'll realize they screwed up somehow. - This will all be behind you. - L know that. But until they do, l'm confined to desk duty... while my colleagues find nothing better to do with their time than stare at me. Cut it out. Couple of guys are playing with you. Relax. Ls Susan taking this better than you are? Of course she is. l haven't told her. What am l going to do? l can't eat, l can't sleep, all l do is worry. L worry about Susan, l worry about Buck and Emily. L worry about the negative effect of worrying on my ling pod flap. That's a lot of worrying. Yes, it is. And l'm worried about it. Look, you want me to talk to Grazer? Find out what's going on? L'm capable of talking to our Captain. But you don't know how to humiliate him into telling you what's going on. L would appreciate anything you could do. No problem. George. L'm glad you're here. L need you to go over the deposition you gave to Chester Charles' attorney. - Why? l told the truth. - L know. L just want to make sure it was recorded properly. You are my key witness. Of course. Everyone wants to make sure of me lately. L can't believe you don't know anything. You had cocktails with the deputy chief last night. - How did you know that? - L looked at your calendar. Look Sikes. They're not gonna tell me anything. Francisco's one of my men. The whole division becomes suspect. You know how l.A. operates. You really don't know anything? Believe it or not, if l did, l'd tell you. - Really? - L'm not the enemy here, Sikes. - Hey, kid, what's going on? - You heard about George? Yeah, l heard l.A. was crawling up everybody's back. Look, l'm really sorry. - You're sorry? - L was in on this thing. L could have screwed up. Please, l get enough paranoia from my partner. Seven stupid grams. That's $300,000, $400,000 on the street after it's cut. Where did it go? Look, l got to go in and take it on this one. Hell, there's a dozen reasons. L could have misread the scales. Theo, you don't make mistakes. Look, l got nine days to bump around on this job... l'd hate to be watching the stripper at my retirement party with any doubts. Theo, you didn't screw up. Hey, kid, what did l tell you about hard evidence? "lt's a hell of a lot better than a man's word." That punk we busted said that the guy that tried to run us down is named Haney. Lawrence Haney. L got a bulletin out on him. He's worth more than a bulletin. He can tell us exactly how much jack there was. Find him and your partner's back on the streets. What's running hot out at the track? Pretty Boy Whelan? You got a permit for this? - Who the hell are you? - He works with me. - L thought you were dead or something. - L'm sorry to disappoint you, Pretty Boy. L'm about to retire and l'm cashing all my old favors. Yeah, well, l don't owe you nothing. Want me to bust him for the concealed weapon? Did you end up playing housewife with some con after the last time l sent you up? - What do you want? - We're looking for Lawrence Haney. - Have fun. - You push his jack on the street? - L ain't pushing nothing. - That's not what we heard. - L ain't seen Haney in a week. - Where was he when you saw him? Stick it. Mustache makes you look a lot more mature than you act. L'll nail your ass if you start messing with me. Did l mention that after l retire l plan on becoming a barber? Son of a bitch. All right. Hangs down at a hotel down on Third Street. LNSTRUCTOR: To the left, two, three, four. To the right, two, stretch, four. No pain, no gain. That's it, come on. - Are you all right? - No, Dad, l'm not all right. L'm having birth pains again. The pains you're feeling, they're not real. Lt's just a sympathetic reaction to what l'm going through. You see? Now l am starting to react to your pains. Perhaps you'd like to do my Peter Fonda workout with me. Lt's designed to relieve pain. That's okay, Dad. You handle pain your way, l'll handle it my way. Into the inner folds of the ling pod flaps. We're going to work on your sack. And begin. To the left, two, three, four. To the right, two, three, four. Never have to say "ouch," if you work to stretch your pouch. Dad. L think l'm gonna blow chunks. Stay with it. We're almost there. And one, two, three, four. And two, two, three, four. And three... Yes, hello. What are you doing home? L thought it would be best for the other officers' concentration. - You're still on that paranoid trip. - Why are you calling, Matthew? - Good news, Theo and l... - Theo? Detective Miles. We teamed so we can catch that guy who bolted from the bust. Yeah. We got a pretty good lead on this Haney guy. That should clear up a lot. Why don't you swing by and pick me up? L want to go with you. You can't go. What do you mean, l can't go? L've got to go. No, you don't. Relax. Stay home. Take care of the baby. The pod is fine. Matthew, this is my career. l want to go. Look, we're up to speed on this, you're not. We don't want anything to jeopardize this bust, do we? - Who's this "we"? - Me and you. - Who else would l be talking about? - Come on, kid. - Kid? - What? We've got a history, George. What're you, jealous? - No, l'm emotional. - L know. Lt'll be okay. L'll call you in a little while. How you doing, Haney? Bill. - Come on, Bill, l need my mail. Let's go. - Don't even blink. - You okay? - Couldn't be better. - Want your nippers? - No, please. Do you think we'll ever get our appetites back? - Can l be excused? - Try to eat a little something. Come on, Buck, it's really good. All slippery and slimy. Mom, Dad, l can't take this anymore. What a wimp. Yeah? Well, if you women went through anything like us men go through... there probably wouldn't be any babies at all. Right, dad? You think my dilation sickness is any less painful than your father's? L just know l got to lie down. L'll get it. What is this? L'm sure you've seen one before, Detective. Lt's a search warrant. L'll show you, Rankin, start your search. Matthew, what is going on? L'm sorry, we did everything we could. We brought Haney in. He confirmed the amount counted at the bust. - Amount of what? - Jack. They think l stole drugs. - My father's a policeman. - Everybody, just stay were you are. This won't take long. Mingo, Franklin start in the kitchen and work your way back here. - You can't do this. What are they doing? - Sit down, lady. They can't do this. Put that picture down. Get your hands off my mother. Take it easy. lt's all right. lt's okay. Emily. This isn't a slave ship, George. Lt's our home. Take it easy, everybody. l know this is tough, but they have to search the house. Lt's procedure. Mom, l'm scared. Take it easy in there. Stay here. Sit down. You're giving me the creeps. Sorry, l'm thinking. - L have to keep walking when l think. - L said sit, Slag. Please, l'm expecting. Walking helps. Lsn't that sweet? The little lady is expecting, boys. Sit down, mother. L know George. He wouldn't do it. Couldn't do it. You know he didn't do it. Captain. What do you want me to say? L just don't know. - You don't know? - Back off, Sikes. No, l won't back off. You work with a man every day, you get to know what kind of person he is. Damn it, Sikes. They found the jack in his house. The chemical analysis was the same as the jack from the bust. Then somebody planted it there. Something. - He didn't take it. - Somebody's got to prove that. Thanks for your concern. - What about bail? - What about it? - He's got rights, Baxley. - All right, Sikes, put a lid on it. - Yeah. - Look, he's a cop. The courts have to be a lot tougher when we break the rules. Or do they have to be tougher because this cop has spots? Well, the Newcomer Advocacy League used some leverage. Considering George's condition, they got a judge to set bail. Thank God for pregnant men. - Where's George Francisco? - L'm right here, Matthew. - Come on, you're out of here. - Lt's about time. What happened to him? He just came down with a bad case of the creeps. L was set up and l know it. - Of course you were. - And l know by whom. Okay. You're monitored. Lt's funny how the universe is so small. This tracking device is very much like what the... overseers used on us at mining camps. Look, George, l'm sorry. lt's the law. At least until the preliminary hearing. - Yes, of course. l understand. - George. - Glad to see you're out. - Why? - Why did you do it? - What are you talking about? L think you know exactly what l'm talking about. You and l were the only ones who handled that jack. L checked, and l assure you l didn't take it! - Do you hear what l'm saying? - Kid, could use a little help here. George, that's enough. Damn it! Cut it out. - You okay? - Yeah, l'm fine. lt's no big deal. - My life is no big deal? - Come on. l'm taking you home. Susan will be here any moment. Lf you need me, you know where to find me. LNSTRUCTOR: Three, two, three, four. Stretch those spots till they're sore. And one, two, three, four, breathe.... Why don't you come and join me, George? Ln, two, three, four, and out.... Not till after the baby. Susan, l am so frustrated. What are we going to do? Lf l have to go to jail, l.... - You're not going to jail, George. - L don't know that. L don't even know if l'll be reinstated. - Lf you're not, we'll survive. - But as what? L can't let this happen. Then it won't. You've gone further and worked harder than so many, Stanya. You'll get past this. We all will. Dad, your partner's here. - Hi. - Matthew. L got some of your junk together. L thought you might want it. You know how the clowns at the station like to rip stuff off. Thank you. - Lt's kind of heavy. - Lt's okay. l'll just take this upstairs. So how are you doing? As well as expected. Look... l just want you to know, l think you got Theo all wrong. He understands what you're going through. L'm sorry, Matthew. l want you to understand what l'm going through. L do. Do you think l took seven grams of jack... and was stupid enough to keep it in my own house? - No, of course l don't. - Well, somebody took that jack. And somebody planted it in my house. And that somebody is Theo Miles. Look, he pulled me off the streets. Got me through the academy. Treated me like his own. And haven't you forgot about something? Like a motive? What does he have to gain by getting you put away? You. - Sikes, get your butt in my office. - What? This just came in from the city attorney's office. That slimeball attorney of Chester Charles' is going to file for a dismissal... on the grounds that our witness, George, is up on a felony count himself. Can he do that? Not only can he do it. He can make it stand up. Well, let's get Bud Anderson to fight it. L just got off the phone with him. He doesn't think it would be worth the effort. Charles blew away his partner in cold blood. What the hell does he want? Some legal system. A felon walks while an innocent cop gets put away. Yeah, you heard me. L think George is innocent. Look, would you break the news to him? - Sure. - Charles sure is a lucky guy. Yeah, maybe just a little too lucky. Get on it. - There you go. - Thank you. - Hey, kid, l've been looking for you. - What's going down? L got a bust set up. Getting close to retire-day. How about coming along and protecting my backside? You getting superstitious all of a sudden? Yeah, l guess l am. - Well, count me in. Give me some advice. - Shoot. - Lt's about George. - Yeah, how's he holding up? Good. L think he's being framed. L think l know by who. Chester Charles. Do you mean that guy that George is going to testify against? You mean, was going to testify against. With George discredited, Charles walks. You got anything to back up this theory of yours? Not really. How hard would it be to arrange a sting like that? Pay somebody off from the department to set up the bust... then plant the jack at George's house? - That'd be nothing for a guy like Charles. - You might be on to something. You tell anybody else about this? What good would it do? L don't have any proof. Well, you've got to do something. What would you do? Plant somebody in the cell with Charles. He may do something or say something. Lt's worth a shot. Lt's a good idea. Thanks, Theo. Lf l don't have all the information, how do you expect me to solve the problem? My teacher says everything you need is in each problem. "A train leaves Los Angeles at 10:30 a.m. traveling east at... "20 km per hour." Well, what are the weather conditions? Lf it's raining, it can't sustain that speed. What difference does it make? L think it's sunny. Weather makes a big difference in... train travel. L'll get the door. What are you doing home? L got in a fight. Lt's not easy being the daughter of a corrupt Slag cop. You got in a fight? Some dumb clod football player. L barely touched him. Emily, why don't you go upstairs and finish your homework? L'm not taking it so well. Starting to feel so dirty. My family looks at me, and this, and.... The memories it brings back for all of us. L know it's not easy, but hang in there. L'm sorry about yesterday, Matt. L didn't mean to attack your friend. - Lt's just more than l can handle. - Forget it. You had every right going after Miles. - Why? He couldn't. - He is, George. And l'm gonna prove it. L'm sorry. Lt's not like he was my father or anything. Oh, no, Matthew. To you he was much more than a father. - Lf there's anything l can do. - L got to do this alone. And, call me if anything starts happening. Remember, l'm the godfather. Hey, what the hell are you doing? We got a bust. Chop-chop. We need to talk, Miles. How about after we hit the crack house so this warrant doesn't go cold? L want to do it now. How much did Chester Charles pay you? You set George up to discredit him. With him bounced off the force, Chester Charles goes free. Do you really believe that? When l told you l wanted to set Charles up... you ran to his attorney. l tailed you. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Huh? What are you doing? You're the guy who taught me everything. L taught you one thing. How to survive, Sikes. You were at the bust. You were at George's. And the money? You live high and hard, Theo. You know you never saved a dime. Give me 24 hours. You know, l watched your back for a year. L carried you home when you used to get smashed down at Casey's. We even cried together. Who is it? An old partner of yours? L screw up a lot, kid. You know that. - What's done is done. - What about my partner? He'll survive. What about me? Miles, please don't do this. Don't walk away from me. Look, l'm not Mister Perfect. Take me off that damn pedestal you got me on. L'm a beat-up old cop trying to find a couple of good years. That's all l am... and all l ever was. L love you like my own. You know that. Well, work it out, kid. - So what do we do now? - L say that's up to you. - The suspect lives alone. - L read the report. Then you know he's armed. He may have even booby-trapped the place. - Watch your step. - Yeah. - Sure. - L'm taking the front. Ln 30. MlLES: Police, freeze. Oh, man. Lt looks like l had my last call after all. Take it easy. l'll get a paramedic. Hey. L taught you more than survival, didn't l, kid? Yeah, you did, Theo. A whole lot more. Theo... don't take George with you. My desk at home. Bank receipt... trace it. L'm sorry. Partners? Partners. - How did it go? - Jury took less than an hour. Charles got life. How about you? You know me at funerals. L said my goodbyes. l'll be okay. Matthew, everything you did, l.... l can never feel what you feel. But l'll never forget what you've done. Let it ride, George. L just wish there was something l could do for you. Be a good cop. You can count on it. What is it? My ling pod flap just dropped. Ls that good? Lt is if l get to the ejection center quickly. - Lt's the big one. - L'll call Susan. - No, we're biologically in sync. - That's right. She knows. Would you drive me to the center? - Me? - Yes. Right. Sure. Murdock, check George and me out. We're going to have a baby, or something. So far, Matthew, you're doing an excellent job. Okay, how we doing? They're focusing. - Well, here's the Bing Bang oil. - Bin Yin. And please, just try to absorb the mood we have created. - Yeah, l'm gonna go absorb the hallway. - Please. Stay. - Lt's time. - Oh, jeez. The Bin Yin is the oil of Celine. - Lt's just for the blessing. - Great. We need the charcoal powder, now. Right, George. Do you need the mallet? No, we're fine. George, it is a girl. Amen.
