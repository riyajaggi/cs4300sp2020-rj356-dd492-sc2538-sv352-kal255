Theirs was a slave ship, carrying a quarter-million beings... bred to adapt and labor in any environment. But they've washed ashore on Earth... with no way to get back to where they came from. And in the last five years, the Newcomers have become the latest addition... to the population of Los Angeles. Forget about it, George, we're not going to catch anybody... by sleeping with the Ding Dongs.

 We're not supposed to sleep. We're on a stakeout. Yeah, six nights in minimart land is enough. But he's already held up every store within a six-mile radius. - Sooner or later he has to come to us. - L'm coming up with a new plan. - Who took the doughnut l had here? - Why are you humans so impatient? George, l'm not cramming myself on top of that beer cooler anymore. Really? l find the arrangements quite comfortable. Maybe you're used to tiny little vibrating crawlspaces... but l didn't grow up on a spaceship, okay? Detective Francisco. Yes, Susan, hi. No, it was a very pleasant night. They called? l am? Well, that's wonderful. Yes, l'm very excited. Tell Emily l am very proud.

 You, too. Goodbye. What? L've just been approved to coach Emily's Little League team. - Ls that funny? - What do you know about baseball? Lt's true that... the closest thing that we had to the sport in the ship was ejecting trash into space. But, after reading several books, l've digested a great deal of information. - Yeah, like what? - What would you like to know? - Don Drysdale's batting average, 1961? - .193. Matthew, did you play baseball as a child? Yeah, sure. Tink Riviere, 1925. Let's see. He played three games that year. He was up at bat only once and struck out. That would be .00. Excuse me, what happened to the food around here? Mr. Sparky Anderson tells a wonderful little anecdote in his book. He said... Top of the ninth, tie ballgame, bases loaded, one out. You got your pitcher at the plate... he's been throwing smoke all day. What do you do? Let's see. That would parallel the 1989 Los Angeles-Cincinnati game... in which manager Tom Lasorda had Mr. Jay Howell... - in exactly the same position. - No, George. - What would you do? - Then there was the '52 Dodgers. Yeah, and the '83 Mets and the '92 Pirates. Lot of input. What's the answer? Matthew, you could help me. Suicide squeeze. Keep your pitcher alive if you can. No. l mean with my team. Help me coach. - No, George. - But Emily would just love it... L said no! All right? Want to know how many hot dogs were sold at the 1987 World Series? - Yeah, tell me that one. - 373,923. Great. You hungry? Let's go for breakfast. - Sikes, Francisco. - Lgnore him. We're going for food. Sikes. Sikes! - You're going to the Ambassador. - Come on, we've been up all night. Yeah, somebody else was, too. Check out the body in the swimming pool. The Ambassador has been closed since '88. L believe it was purchased by a Luibof sect. A what? Lt obviously was a ceremonial cremation of one of their members. Obviously? What are you talking about? You're looking at a pile of soot. There are crystals and artifacts mixed in with the remains. We're investigating a homicide, lady. Just stay back. Matthew, she's a spiritual leader. Perhaps we should step out for a moment. - How do you know she's a spiritual leader? - By her markings. What, you got built-in sunglasses? We're finding we're adapting quite well to your sunlight. - Got anything else up your sleeve? - Just my arms. Thank you. Klyseen has not yet completed his journey. Yeah, well, l got to disagree with you on that one. There must be some mistake. Please, let me help you. l'm Okno. - Venda Crystals... - They are to guide us on our journey. - You're welcome to keep one if you wish. - Look, there's a hunk of toast... down there and if you can't come up with a good explanation... we're going to have to open a homicide investigation. - What? - Lt was what l thought. What, you believe her? L think we've done what we can here. Matthew, what are you doing? The 1993 Secular Senate granted them permission to practice their beliefs. Yeah, EPA Violation 444 grants me permission... to practice my beliefs. We're very strict on open fires. He's always rather testy before breakfast. George, we've been driving for a half hour, l want breakfast. Yes, of course, but now that we're out here... it will only take a minute. But.... l'm really so excited. Emily and l've been practicing out here all week on my lunch break... working on the fundamentals. L think l'm getting the hang of it. - Where did this come from? - The trunk. Matthew, if you could just show me... you know, give me some good old-fashioned insight. Lnsight? This is a ball. You hit this with that and you catch it with this. That's all the insight you need. Let's go. Emily has been questioning me on the head-on Pete Rose slide. - L just want to see if l have it down. - The head.... George. L started a little too soon, but how was my form? Nobody cares about form if they get you out. You were out. - That's not good, is it? - Look, George, it's been great. Let's go. No. Wait, please. L'm quite good at catching. Watch this. Willie Mays, 1954. Roberto Clemente, 1971. Bo Jackson, 1994. Pretty good. Not bad. What do you think? That's great, George. That's really great. Can we go now? l'm starving. Matt. L'm going to be the coach. Lt's a very important position of responsibility. - Emily is counting on me. - So what do you want me to do about it? Just give me a few pointers. L find batting the most difficult, but it's very important. - Yeah, you could say that. - L've almost got the hang of it. Lf you could just hum me a few. Please? - We do this. You buy breakfast. - Wonderful. As many of those little chicken placentas as you like. Lt all happens right here at this little pentagon, doesn't it, Matthew? All right. Carl Yastrzemski. Pete Rose. Rod Carew. - Just hit the ball, George. - Yes, of course. All right, hit one for the ripper. Swing, batter, batter. Let it rip. Hey, batter, batter, batter. Matthew, one more. l wasn't ready. Okay. - You wanna play major league? Let's do it. - Right. All right, here we go. Okay, that's it, George. Let's go. No, Matthew. One more, please. L know what l did there. You missed everything l threw at you. L'm hungry, let's go. All right, let's see. Fernando has a no-hitter going into the bottom of the ninth. He winds, he pitches, he.... - Get one in my glove, l'll think about it. - Right. Now, that was a Nolan Ryan split-finger fastball. You see, l overcompensated with my right wrist. Now, Mickey Mantle suggests that you raise your back elbow... and bring back your back foot. Thus. Just one more, Matthew. Lt would be an enormous help. One more, Matthew, please. Don't you want to get back on the mound? - Matt, are you all right? - Yeah, l'm fine. All right, all right, then. Fire away. There it goes. Yes. The World Series is over. He hit that ball right out of the park. DlSPATCHER: 1-William-152, stand by. 52, go. DlSPATCHER: Officers on the scene report a male Newcomer at a convenience store. 21 1 is in progress. George, our guy's working. Where's it going down? The store on Tyrone and Magnolia. - 52. Put us in route. - L'll get the stuff. - What's the situation? - Nice to see somebody. Place emptied out when some guy pumped it full of tear gas. - That's our M.O., Matthew. - Your partner covering the back? L'm by myself, guys. And you're the first backup l've seen. All right. l'll get around there. George, you run it from here. - Matthew, your gas mask. - Right, thanks. - L'm gonna get closer. Cover me. - Got you. Matthew, he's moving toward the rear exit. Got it. Matthew. Get an ambulance. Do it now! He doesn't have a pulse. Come on, Matthew. Doctor, do you want to call in a cardiologist? Hold it together, gang, now. - Ls he breathing? - He stopped on the way in. - Blood pressure? - L'm not getting anything. - Call a code blue. - Already did. What happened? He must have been pushed against the wall. lt must be his head. - He's ready, Doctor. - Hold up on the CPR. - Sinus bradycardia. - Get me a half amp of bicarb. Let's get him out of here. Please, Detective, you'll have to wait out in the corridor. - Yes, of course. Does it look bad? - The doctor will be out as soon as he can. Get me an amp of atropine now. My friend is gone. L'm sorry. lt wasn't meant to happen. Who are you? Look, l want you to take a couple of days off, George. L would rather stay busy. Yeah, l guess we all would. - Lf there's anything l can do.... - Thank you. L'm going to drive Cathy home. Ls she all right? Are you all right? Yes. L just want to stay and take care of whatever must be done. Neemu, the doctor said he didn't feel any pain. Lt was good that we had a chance to know him. He's alive, he's alive. He's alive. He's alive. The last robbery occurred three days ago... here on Magnolia still within the six-mile radius. Any idea why he doesn't go any further out than that? We are working on the theory that our robber doesn't have transportation... and therefore must live within walking distance... to all the convenience stores. No hits in the last three days. That, too, is his pattern. One hit every three or four days. So he's probably ready for another attempt. Thank you, George. All right, people, three days since this guy put Sikes in a hurt locker... the D.A. gave us an attempted murder warrant. L'm tired of us looking bad. L want him. Understood? All right, let's roll. George. How is he doing? He's anxious to get back to work. Yeah, well, he should enjoy the vacation while he can. - How are you doing? - Anxious to have my partner back. Lt looks like you've got him. Hey, Albert, how is it going? Sgt. Sikes. Lt's so good to see you back with us. Yeah, well, considering the alternative.... Hey, George. - Welcome back, Matthew. - Yeah, thanks. What's everybody looking at? Never seen a dead man before? Glad to see you back. L need to talk to you. Not here. Come on. And after the crystals fell on me... he touched me, George. L could feel his hand on my chest. L could feel my body jerk alive again. What a wonderful dream. L didn't know you dreamed when you were dead. Matt. We've been working with several witnesses... and a composite sketch of the perp... with your input, would help us a great deal. L can tell you what he looked like. L can tell you what he smelled like, George. He touched me. He did more than touch you, he slammed you up against a brick wall. Matt, l still think the hospital released you much too soon. They didn't have any choice. Look, l laid in that hospital bed for three days. You can do a lot of thinking in three days. L don't know.... What? You don't know what? Ls it possible.... Can you Newcomers bring people back? - Back? - To life. Heal them. Matthew, we have many advantages over you... but bringing back the dead is not one of them. Don't you think maybe there could be this powerful guy on the ship who could... No, Matthew. Lf there was such a being, with the losses on our ship... he would be known. He was there, George. ln the room. He touched me. The doctor said that you were revived because of a final thrust... of adrenaline in your body. That's the latest theory. The fact is they don't know for sure. What's important is that you're alive. What's important is finding out what brought me back. Someone would have seen him come out of the E.R. The room was empty when l went in. Matthew, you were alone. Yeah? Then where did this come from? And so his journey is complete. Lt's good to see you again. Are you finding comfort within our sect? No, l get plenty of comfort on my own. Thank you very much. Right now, l'm just looking for some answers. You're welcome to join us in worship. Why don't you just tell me what this thing is? The Venda Crystal intrigues you. This one does. L didn't see you slip it on me the last time l was here. Then would l be lying if l said l didn't? L don't know. Would you? The people of Luibof give these crystals to one another... to help them through difficult passages. Well, l got one, and l'm not hanging out with any Luibofs. Lf there's a need for the crystal, please keep it. L don't think so. Do your lips speak the same truth as your heart? Look... you ever heard of any Newcomers... raising the dead? One of you once wrote it is the human who is the alien. The human who has no cousin to the moon. So you have or haven't? Our ceremonies are open, Mr. Sikes. Experience our consciousness and many paths will be lighted. Yeah. Sure. L'll think about that one. There goes one theory out the window. Doesn't make sense. Six hits all within a six-mile radius. - Why change now? - Maybe this thing with Sikes spooked him. Nothing spooked him before. The first hit, he was almost apprehended by two uniforms. The third, a clerk shot at him. Must be something more. A common denominator that has taken him outside the six-mile radius. Let's come up with that something before all the people... we got sleeping in convenience stores wonder what the hell it is they're doing. L'll have a full report on your desk in the morning. All right, what about this sector? Would you like some more tea? No, thanks. l'm fine. Thanks for making dinner. - Did l burn the flesh enough? - Yeah, you did fine. Thanks. Ls your body sore? Would you like for me to rub it? No. Thanks. l just kinda want to be alone. - Of course. l'm sorry. - No. Thanks for coming over and cooking and everything. Lt's just been a hell of a day. A long three days. L missed you, Matt. L'm really glad you're home. You know, if you need... anything. Thanks. Break. Three and two. The ceremony will tell you many things. L don't want to know many things. What you choose to know will become truth if you allow it in. - L don't know if l know how to do that. - Many humans find it hard at first, but... l am here to help you. - Does he live here? Can l talk to him? - Don't think merely of this world. Release yourself and you will see clearly. L need to find the man who was at the hospital. You will find guidance. Let the spirit consume you and give you direction. Shall we prepare ourselves for transition? Our bodies are clean and our minds are open. Now let us find the light to guide us. As we mark our bodies as Luibof guides us... let us look into our minds to guide the hands that mark us. Dad, wait. Don't go, Dad. L hate you. You're not a father. You're nobody. - L hope you die. - Get out of here. What are you doing? No, Daddy. No. Dad. The sun has barely risen and you're leaving? - Guess l'm not Luibof material. - Have we offended you? No. lt's been a hell of a trip. But the stuff you fed me in there isn't what l'm looking for. What are you looking for, Mr. Sikes? - A little truth. - Then let us help you. You dish up bad memories, lady. L can do that all by myself. Thanks for slipping me the rock. The great Jacques Barzun, in his deeply moving work... God's Country and Mine, wrote: "Whoever wants to learn the heart and mind of America... "had better learn baseball... "the rules and realities of the game." Now, wasn't that a wonderful thought? Yogi Berra said, "They're done singing, let's get on with the game." Really? L hadn't read that. So? l made it up. Are we gonna practice or what? L've drawn out a complete workout schedule. However, l'm not quite done with my opening remarks. Dad, l think everyone's getting bored with the opening remarks. Really? Well, then, perhaps we can move on. However, the great Tom Lasorda once said... Lasorda sucks. Billy, how would you like to go run 150 laps? Dad. Everyone, l want you to meet my assistant coach. Albert. Albert works with me at the station. He's also Binnaum to my children. And he has very graciously volunteered his time. What's a Bin Bun? He catalyses my emission when we are going to have... - Dad, let's move on. - All right. Say hello to what's going to be the number one Little League team. - Hello. - Albert has done his homework as well. And l think you'll find him very knowledgeable about the game. As the great Jacques Barzun once wrote... Albert, we're moving on from the opening remarks to the drills. Very well, the Mr. Tommy Lasorda exercises? No. We better make it Sparky Anderson. Go with a champ if you wanna be a champ. All right, everyone onto the field for calisthenics. Watch George. Roberto Clemente. Very good. Willie Mays. All right, l thought today was an excellent beginning. L hope you did as well. Yes, just remember what Mr. Sparky Anderson says. Can we go now? Yes... thank you all. And l'll.... l'll see you next week. Why does that little boy remind me of my partner? Dad, do you think you're doing this right? L don't know. Something seems wrong, doesn't it? Everybody's just doing what you say. That's what they're supposed to do. The coach is the leader. The one the team looks to for direction. Yeah, l guess. You don't think that's right? L mean, you're real good at explaining and everything. But.... So why can't we hit home runs like Babe Ruth... and steal bases like Willie Randolph? L don't know. L'm sure it's in the books. DlSPATCHER: 1-William-152. 1-William-152. Go ahead. Your partner has requested you back at the division. Did he say why? He's about to roll on your 21 1 suspect. - Put me in route. - Roger. Emily, tell Albert what's happening and to take you home. - L'm not sure how late l'll be. - Okay, Coach. Peter Rabbit. What makes you so sure he's our man? Just a gut feeling l've been backing up all morning. Madison, l want you to coordinate a hit on his apartment... in case he didn't come to work today. Matthew, l ran these same profiles through days ago. L've been checking each one out. L took a little shortcut and came up with something interesting. These photos that the computer kicked out... they got a lot more baggage attached than all the others. Look at this. No record with the D.M.V. Means he doesn't drive, right? Fits right into our theory. We have another one. Outside the six-mile radius. Yeah, l saw that when l came in. So how does he get around? This one here put us right back on square one. - Hell, that's the one that nailed our guy. - Matthew, what are all these lines? This city is a grid of routes. Bus routes, garbage routes, and look at this. - Recycling routes? - Right. Look. He worked the route on the third. The noon to 6:00 shift. Convenience store was hit at 4:30. He was probably on a break then. And then here on the seventh. The midnight shift. Lt all fits together, George. We got him. - L'm going to bring him in. - We're going to bring him in. Okay. Come on, Babe. Let's hit a home run. Give me your hand. - Nice work, Matthew. - Yeah, thanks. - What are you looking at? - Remember me? The guy you almost killed. Lt's my party now. Let's go. - L go with my own, thanks. - You go with me. Matthew. Matt. Matthew. What are you doing? We still have work to clear up here. George, l'm a cop, all right. This is the cake we wait for. Let me take him in alone. Let me enjoy the moment. Of course. l'll finish up here. Get a ride back with one of the patrol cars. - Nice going, Matthew. - Yeah, you, too. You killed me. And you brought me back. Didn't you? This is not the police department. Why did you bring me here? You gonna tell me what's going on? L know all about you, man. l saw you. Then what are we sitting here for? Just tell me. Tell me the truth. What you said to me. You said, "lt wasn't meant to happen." l heard you. You can do it, can't you? You can bring people back to life. You can heal people. Come on, what the hell is the big secret? You humans cannot deal with all that we have within us. I am to take from those who have more than they need... and give it to those without food or clothing. But you broke laws. Laws on paper do not mean as much as the laws of existence. Some of us are chosen to remind the world of that. You can save us. Say it. You can bring back the dead, can't you? Good... can be raised just as easily as evil. You see why the gift must be kept within? A garbage man's going to save the world. What did a carpenter's son do? Why don't l show you? - Peter Rabbit. That's a positive l.D.? - Yes, sir. Everything in his apartment. Airline stubs, expensive clothes. All are traceable... and seem to have been purchased on or after the date of the robberies. Our suspect led a rather cavalier lifestyle. Couple of hundred bucks here and there and he'd blow it as fast as he stole it. That seems to be his M.O. Okay, l want you to tie everything you can into the robberies. L want this guy fileted nice and neatly. - Fileted? - Forget it. - Where is he now? - L assume Matthew is processing him. Hasn't been anybody through booking in an hour. Detective Francisco. Ls backup rolling? - Tell them l'm on my way. - What is it? Matthew is in pursuit. The suspect got away. There is only one way into this dead end and it's covered. That leaves one way out. L'm going up. Get a chopper in the air and circle the back. - Matthew, what happened? - What does it look like? The creep got away. The second he had a shot he took it. He was cuffed in the back of your car. George, we'll talk about this later. - Now, l'm going after the son of a bitch. - Talk to me now. L got other things to deal with right now. You deal with me now. George, get a shotgun and back me up. All right. Freeze, Rabbit, it's all over. L believed you, man. Look, it's over. L lied. - L'm just a garbage man. - Matthew! - You have the right to remain silent. - Get away from him, George. What are you really angry at? - Get away from him. - What is it? What is it, Matthew? L believed him. He said he could do it. No. - You wanted to believe him. - L can still see him at the hospital. Touching me. Even now. - How's that for gullible? - No. He was at the airport buying a ticket to Las Vegas when you were in the E.R. Why not? That's perfect. - Lt was all me. - Yes, but that's all right. Let it out, Matthew. Let it out, Matthew. - How do you let out 25 years? - What do you mean, 25 years? - L just wanted to talk to him. - Talk to whom, Matthew? L just wanted to talk to my father. Your father died when you were a little boy. - No. - Yes. - Yes, he did. 25 years ago. - No, he didn't. He didn't. After he was shot, he was never really there. The past five years, he's been like that. L'm sorry, Matthew. He's been dying for 25 years. And all l ever wanted him to hear.... l hated that bastard. All l.... All l ever wanted him to hear... was l really didn't want him to die. Tell him. Look at him. He hasn't heard anything in a long time. Matthew, you haven't said anything in a real long time. L want him back, George. L want to tell him. Then you must tell him. L'll wait outside. Hi, Dad. L thought maybe we could.... l don't know.... l got some things l want to say to you. So, how are we doing over here? Real good. No problem. L got the Carew stance down. Lt's your turn. Thanks. Do you want me to use the Rod Carew stance... with the Carl Yastrzemski? L want you to do whatever feels right inside. Really? Even the best didn't get there... without making a few discoveries of their own.
