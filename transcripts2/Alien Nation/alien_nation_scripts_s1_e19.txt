Theirs was a slave ship, carrying a quarter-million beings... bred to adapt and labor in any environment. But they've washed ashore on Earth... with no way to get back to where they came from. And in the last five years, the Newcomers have become the latest addition... to the population of Los Angeles. Nu-Knit was first manufactured over a decade ago...

 aboard the Newcomer slave ship. Lts incredible durability... far surpasses any human synthesized fabric... whether it be cellulose, petroleum, or polymer-based. The fibers are so strong, the weave so dense... that Nu-Knit cannot be cut by traditional means. At the factory, we use lasers. This same fiber strength and density of weave... gives Nu-Knit a truly out-of-this-world stain resistance. Just take a look at this. Even this commercial motor oil can't soak in. Lt simply rinses off clean. Nu-Knit is a tremendous gift of Tenctonese technology. We humans owe a great debt to my partner...

 who reconstructed the process, bringing this amazing fabric to us. Mr. Edgar Allan Poe. And that's his lovely wife, Rita. Earth's gift in return to this great scientist. All of you here tonight are very special people... respected members of the community. And we would like to personally invite you... to join the Nu-Knit family by becoming limited partners. Permits are in place for our expansion. And the Department of the Environment has given us the green light. As you can see from our prospectus... we anticipate a 25% return on our investment. And after our deal is finalized with the US Army to manufacture uniforms... that estimate will jump to 40%. Now, whether or not you decide to invest... each of you will receive a free complimentary gift... just for being here tonight... in this beautiful replica of the caves of Tencton. Your own Nu-Knit vest. As the Tenctonese say: Thank you. Good speech, Lee. L always get so tongue-tied. That's okay, Cyril... all you got to do is keep balancing those books. You were wonderful. What did you think, Edgar? We have to talk. Excuse us. - What do you think, $2,000? - That's nothing, George. Let's invest $5,000 or $10,000. But, Susan, we don't have that kind of money. George, l'm working now. We have $10,000 in that money market account... just sitting there at 6%. They're talking 40%. Lf we did invest, say, $4,000, we'd have a return of... $1,600. Lf we invested $7,000... that would be a return of $2,800 the first year. Roll that over, in three years we'd have almost $1 1,000. Let's invest all $10,000. Okay. We've always wanted to have a UV Room... We could do that now. Vessna's so energetic... l'd love to buy her an oddyash wheel she could climb in her nursery. L saw a lovely one at Bullock's. - Go ahead. Buy it. - What did you guys decide? The best thing for our future. And how is our little Vessna? - You invested, didn't you? - A little. They're taking advantage of unskilled Tenctonese workers... who have to put in double shifts at minimum wage with no overtime pay. Buck, you don't know that. No. Marilyn says the Nu-Knit workers have no healthcare, no benefits. - Marilyn? Who's Marilyn? - My American history teacher. - See, we're studying the labor movement. - You call your teacher by the first name? Marilyn's not into any kind of power trip. Marilyn says Nu-Knit is exploiting its Tenctonese workers. Lf she's so smart, why don't you ask this Marilyn... where these "exploited" workers would be without Nu-Knit. No, l will tell you where. Unemployed, that's where. What are they teaching kids in school these days? Neemu, calm down. You know, you look very handsome in a tuxedo. Sergeant. Thanks, Al. Moonlighting last night. - That must be fun. - Damn! Every day you buy three of these tickets and scratch the aluminum off. Three is a lucky number, Albert. So that's why you do it? Because it's fun? No. You win money. See, three pineapples in a row, that's $25,000. Just for scratching off some aluminum? That's a lot of money. L could buy so many trees. Trees? You buy trees? For the city. The city needs more trees. No, Albert, the idea is, you win money... and then you buy something you really like. Something you couldn't afford, something really great. Like a car. - But you already have a car. - No, l have a car, l don't have the car. Albert, you know what that is? That is happiness. A '63 split-window Vette. A '63 split-window Vette. 340 horsepower... four-speed pull, positraction, 0 to 60 in seven seconds. But it's more than that, Albert. The car is... fine. - Fine. - Yeah. Good morning. ElNSTElN: Good morning, George. George, that is a very nice vest. Why, thank you, Albert. Man, does it glow in the dark? What's this? Ketchup. - Ls this some new alien thing? - L'm glad you asked. As you can see, my Nu-Knit vest is incredibly stain-resistant. - Nu-Knit? - Yes. A gift of Tenctonese technology... which is now being synthesized here in Los Angeles. Susan and l have just become limited partners. Lt's a very sound investment. L got your sound investment. Now that is nothing but an extravagant fantasy. Ln the year l've known you, you've spent over $750 on lottery tickets. L won $25 last month, okay. You just wait and see, George. A pineapple... a peach... and a banana! What'd you win? Nothing, Albert. Nothing at all. Sgt. Sikes, could l do one? Albert, they don't give these away for free. L'll pay for it. Lt's a waste of money. - Please. - Lf you insist. Lf he insists, huh? Just don't blame me. You're just throwing away your money, Albert. One pineapple... two pineapples.... What are you doing? Go on. This is fun. L'm gonna save the rest for later. They had no right to bust me, no right! The guy swung at me first! Come on, take it easy. L'm gonna get you for this. L'm gonna get you. Look. l don't want no problem out of you. - You got one phone call. - Go to... Look out, George! - Hold him. - No right! No right! Get a doctor in here! No, l'm all right. My vest. Lt didn't go through. - L'm bruised, but l'm all right. - Man, don't scare me like that. Amazing. Ls it too late to get in on this? George, we got 10 minutes left on our break. l need to go to the bank. - L gotta get some cash. - Matt, this vest saved my life. The least l can do is thank them. Besides, l own a piece of this company. Do you realize what that means to a former slave? - No. l want to see it. - Okay. Let's just not take all day. Matt, your hat. Remember the hole in the ozone. - Yeah. Okay, mother? - You need a mother. Workers here don't need a union. They don't want a union. MARlLYN: Then why do you object to giving them a choice? You don't work here. You don't understand the situation. We understand basic needs, we understand dignity. L know your group. You come here to stir up trouble. And l'm not gonna let that happen. Now get out of here, both of you! Fine. lf that's management's position, we'll go talk to the workers. That sounds like... These are your own people. How could you do this to them? Out! Get out now! Dad. Oh, boy. - What are you doing here? - Why aren't you in school? L have a free lunch period. - This is your son? - Yes. What's this all about? Your son and this woman came here... on behalf of a so-called citizens group, agitating for a union. Dad, this is Marilyn, my teacher. You drag your students into your personal politics? L wanted to come. l insisted. Do you realize your father has a considerable investment in this company? That's his problem. Mr. Francisco, l'm sorry we had to meet like this. You'll have to forgive my son. He's young. - See if you can talk some sense into him. - Yes, l will. l'm sorry. Well, you old robber baron, you. Looks like this sound investment of yours is causing a little domestic strife. What you say? You want to take a peek? See how they're exploiting the workers? All right. L don't know what they're bitching about. This is a real garden spot. Just because it looks unpleasant doesn't mean it's harmful in any way. - Matt? - L can't breathe. Matt! Why hadn't anything been done about that leak? No one noticed. You see, the fumes don't bother the Newcomers... and only Newcomers work in there. That's no excuse. There should've been warning signs... to protect humans in case things like this happen. - Are you all right, Matt? - Yeah. l'm okay. - You sure you don't want a doctor? - No, l'm fine. Let's go. CYRlL: l'll see you out. Get those signs up. Don't look so glum. Everything's okay. L'm sick of you. L'm sick of your lies. Lt's not easy running a business. There are bound to be oversights. Man, my head is killing me. L need an aspirin. Francisco, l just had my broker invest $5,000 in this. - Lt's a winner, right? - L can't think of a better investment. - Nu-Knit is one-of-a-kind. - So was the Edsel. Albert! Damn, where's Albert? He went to collect his money. Money. What money? Three pineapples. He won the lottery. Lt's always an alien, eh, Sikes? L bust my hump working two jobs and pulling overtime... just to make the boat payments... and what happens? E.T. comes along and wins the lottery. There ought to be a law. L mean, they weren't even born here. $25,000. Now l really do feel sick. Matt, l just heard that Albert won the lottery. Did Matt tell you that he was the one who sold Albert the ticket? Lt was Matt's ticket. You know, George, you got a really big mouth. Lsn't it ironic that after all the times you've lost... the one ticket that would've made you the winner is.... Albert. - Aren't you going to congratulate him? - Yeah. Congrats. You were right, Sgt. Sikes, three is a lucky number. Lt was the third ticket, and three pineapples. Better put that money in the bank, Albert. - L've already spent it. - That's perfect. You know, give them a little money, they blow it right away. Give whom a little money? Sgt. Sikes, l have a surprise. - L bought you something. - What? Eucalyptus? Douglas fir? Lt's outside. That is your surprise. Oh, Albert. This was a very foolish way to spend your money. - You could've invested in Nu-Knit. - L'll win again. That lottery's easy. Albert, why? Why'd you do it? ElNSTElN: You always seem so... discontented. l wanted you to be happy. So is it "fine"? Lt is so fine. You're not going to accept this, Matthew. He has to accept it. l bought it for him. Yeah. He bought it for me. L have to accept it. - So you're happy now? - Man, l'm so happy. Gonna take it for a spin. No, you're not. Our general partner, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe... was just found dead in his swimming pool. Lt's a possible homicide. You and Sikes are on the case. - Francisco. - Yes? L'm sorry about Mr. Allan Poe, but... remember, l have an investment in this? Right. There you go. Grazer's not gonna be too happy if Nu-Knit goes belly-up... like its owner. Say, how much do you have invested? As much as Grazer? No. Not that much. You know, you forgot your hat. What do we have? Homicide. Somebody poured sea salt in the water. For a Newcomer that's like jumping into a pool of acid. - But, of course, you'd know that. - Yes. The tissue destruction indicates... the body had been in the water for two hours. So l'd set the time of death at about 3:00 p.m. Wonder if these are Nu-Knit? - Sorry. - Any idea when the salt was introduced? Allan Poe's wife said he swam twice a day... in the morning and when he got home from work. So it had to have been between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. - ls that the wife? - Yes. - Human, huh? - Doctor's giving her a sedative. She discovered the body. Thank you. Looks like the widow made out pretty good, marrying Allan Poe. Now that's a sound investment. Are you saying she married him for his money? Heavens, no. Why? Because she's human and he's a Newcomer? They can't have been in love? Let's just say money's a hell of an aphrodisiac. Mrs. Allan Poe? Police. Would you feel up to making a statement? L'll try. You found your husband when you got home? Lt was horrible. Horrible. - Lf this is too difficult now... - No. l'm all right. - Were you out all day? - Yes. l left before Edgar went to work. L had a lot to do. - Mrs. Allan Poe. - L understand, Detective. L can account for my whereabouts. L've never seen a car like this. - Ls it yours? - Yeah. - What happened to your other one? - Nothing. Then why do you need this one? L don't need it, l want it. A car like this is better than sex. Really? That's just an expression. See, this car's a classic. Lt's a Corvette... - '63 split-window Vette. - That's old for a car. Who wants a new one? The '96s run like dogs. All that smog control stuff. Then it must get very good gas mileage. - Lt gets terrible gas mileage. - Then it's not economical? You don't buy a car like this because it's economical. Economy's no fun. By the time l pay for garage space and insurance and an alarm system... this car's gonna cost me a fortune. A fortune? Cathy, this is not just a car. Lt's a work of art. Like the Mona Lisa. Like the Statue of Liberty. Lt's spiritual. L have always dreamed of having this car. And now, here it is. Come on, l'll take you for a ride. Okay. Not many cars had bucket seats back in '63. Or a cluster dash. Listen to that engine! What was that? Nothing. l just have to get used to the clutch. Sounds like your U-joint went out. Jeez. Matt, l don't think this is better than sex. The nursery's the first door on your left. Right. Watch the credenza. - What is that? - Oh, hi, George. That's Vessna's oddyash wheel. Susan, how much did it cost? - $700. - $700? There was a cheaper one, but it had a plastic frame. Leave the door open. We'll be right in with the chair. Chair? What chair? Lt was going to be a surprise. You know that vibrating La-Z-Boy you've been wanting? Susan, that chair costs over $2,000. You deserve it, neemu, and anyway, we can afford it. Where was that year-old milk? Lf it isn't Karl Marx. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Son. L'm surprised to find you here. Shouldn't you and Marilyn be out leading the proletarian revolution? Dad, are you still mad about today? Someone should tell Marilyn that she's supposed to teach history... not make it. Need l remind you... that socialism was completely discredited in the '80s? This has nothing to do with socialism. Need l remind you that if your mother and l lose this investment... we won't be able to afford those $300 sneakers... in which you champion the underclass. L'm not wearing leather anymore, only cruelty-free clothes. - What? - Clothes no animal was killed for. Where do you think your shoes came from? See. lt's all part of the same sickness. Killing animals, polluting the oceans, destroying the ozone. Marilyn's turned me onto a lot of things. Marilyn. Last night the U-joint in the Vette went out. Lt's with my mechanic now. What's that gonna cost? You think you have problems. Susan runs our credit card to the limit with this La-Z-Boy... and now because of Nu-Knit, our investment... - we don't have the savings to pay it off. - George, it's a sound investment. Then my insurance guy tells me it's gonna cost $4,000 every six months... - just to insure the damn thing. - You wanted this vehicle. L'm going to have to pay 22% interest on that card. Twenty-two? Where'd you get 22? Fortunately, the technology was in place at the time of Edgar's death. From here on in, it's really a matter of marketing. L don't anticipate any further expenditure in development... - in the near future. - Okay, so... Yeah? RECEPTlONlST: The detectives are here. Show them in. Excuse me, l'll let you gentlemen talk. By the way, you can rest assured about your investment. The company's in good shape. Look, l can tell you right off... l don't have any idea why anyone would kill Edgar. He was the sweetest guy. He had no enemies. - L just can't believe this happened. - And when did you last see him? The afternoon he died. You were here. That school teacher and your son, they upset him. L told him to knock off early and forget about it. How upset was he? He'd never had any experience with labor relations. Are you suggesting he might have committed suicide? We're not suggesting anything. We're just trying to determine what happened. Do you know of anyone who may have profited from Mr. Allan Poe's death? L can tell you this: l had everything to lose. Without Edgar, there's no Nu-Knit. Okay, we're gonna need a full financial report. Lnvestors, profit participation, everything. Of course. But if l may... what's that got to do with Edgar's death? You're a businessman, Mr. Smith, you ought to know... money's a hell of a motivator. Tell me exactly what he said. "You can rest assured about your investment. "The company is in good shape." Okay. Stay on top of it. And you're sure about that? Okay, thanks. That was the maitre d' at the restaurant... where Mrs. Allan Poe had lunch the day her husband was murdered. She said she had reservations at 12:00. But the maitre d' says she didn't get there till 12:30. He remembers because he had already given away her table. Matt, Mrs. Allan Poe said she was at the beauty salon before that. She still wouldn't have had time to go home and put salt in the pool. Yeah. She said she was at the beauty salon till 1 1:30. But the owner said by 1 1:00 she had already been out of there. There's an hour and a half hole in her alibi. Let's go have another little chat with Mrs. Allan Poe. No answer. - Car's here. - Let's try around back. Rita, l warned you, don't. Rita, don't. No, come here. Rita. Looks like the widow's taking it hard. L love Rita, and she loves me. But how could we tell Edgar? We both adored him. Lt would've broken his heart. Yeah, it's breaking mine. You guys thinking of tying the knot? - We've discussed it. Why? - Could make for a happy ending. Edgar's interest in Nu-Knit combined with yours. - Look, money has nothing to do with this. - What about the missing hour and a half? Lee and l were at the Duncamp Hotel. Look, l know how that sounds. But it's the only way that we could be alone. To be together. Can anyone substantiate your alibi? - The desk clerk. - And room service. We had a bottle of champagne. Look, if we killed Edgar... do you think we'd be stupid enough to be seen like this? L don't know about stupid, but it sure is tacky. We love each other. That's our only crime. - Easy, man, easy. - Come on. This way. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Their alibi holds. Room service waiter remembers bringing them bubbly. Says Rita was wearing a black negligee. Nice color for a widow. We struck out. - George, l'm worried. - About what? My mechanic hasn't called. When he doesn't call, that's bad news. - Matt, we have a case. - L know, l know. So, who else would want to bump off Poe? L think l know someone we should ask. There's still a lot of controversy over FDR. Some people feel that the WPA was the beginning of the downfall of this country. And other people believe that without the New Deal... we would've had a revolution on our hands. - Ms. Houston. - Dad. Buck. - We need to talk to your teacher. - Okay, go ahead. - What's this about? - Ls it Edgar Allan Poe? We're investigating his death, yeah. As an investor, isn't this a conflict of interest? L'm able to maintain my professional integrity. Thank you for your concern. L'm not going anywhere. - Buck. - No. Now, please, go home. Lt's okay, Buck. You seem to have a great deal of influence over my son. L think he's terrific. We care about the same things. Ms. Houston, you believe the workers at Nu-Knit are dissatisfied. Ls there anybody you know... who would have a particular grudge against Mr. Poe? Enough to kill him? No. And if you consider me a suspect, l was teaching all afternoon. Lt's reassuring to know that you spend some time at your job. - So you need a few extra bucks? - Yeah, my insurance is killing me. Tell me. l thought l'd never get that four-by paid for. L just talked to my mechanic. L knew it was gonna be bad. The whole tranny's shot. - The tranny? - The tranny's gone. - That's bad. - Talk about differential, the U-joint... Here. This is the company l work security for. You come by 10:00 tonight. We will talk to the boss. - Phil, l appreciate this. This is great. - No problem at all. Lt's my pleasure, buddy. - Sgt. Sikes. - Hey, Al. What's the matter, aren't you happy? - Why should l be happy? - The car. You have the car. Yeah. l'm on top of the world. How can it have a top? lt's round. Matt, l've been cross-referencing Nu-Knit's financial disclosure... with public records. L've found something odd. Tomorrow, George. lt's closing time. - How's the investigation coming? - Lt's perplexing. - L found another one. - Another what? Another limited partner who was deceased... at the time he invested in Nu-Knit. Now this one died a year and a half before Nu-Knit was even open to investors. - How could that be? That's impossible. - Exactly. Look, Francisco, l made this investment on your recommendation. Captain, l never actually solicited your funds... Francisco... l did this without asking my wife. She says l have no business sense. You realize how serious it would be if l lost the money? They expect us to make a full round of the premises... in two hours. And they expect us to get from clock station 2... to clock station 3 in 35 minutes. Lt really takes about 10. So you can sneak into the janitor's closet and get some shuteye. - You have to wear the uniforms? - Yeah, they're real sticklers about that. - Anybody to talk to around here? - The boss goes home around midnight. There is Bernard. He does inventory. He's not real sociable. He just got out of the hospital. Swell. Phil! Mr. Elias, this is my friend, Detective Sikes. He's interested in a job. Phil, last night you missed clock box number 4 again. You are sleeping! No, Mr. Elias, the key must've jammed. Phil, don't lie to me, okay? L give this man your job. - He's a great kidder. - L'm not kidding, Phil. Tonight, you sweep the loading dock, okay? No, Mr. Elias, l am a security guard... not a janitor. Phil, don't argue with me, okay? You, buddy, you come to my office in five minutes. - You have to take that crap? - He doesn't mean it. You know, l don't know about this, Phil. Well, hey, it pays the bills. - What about your car? - Yeah, my car. Yeah, me, too. L don't do this, l can't afford my boat. Now, let me ask you something. When was the last time you actually got to use your boat? Well.... One-William-One, 52, this is dispatch. 52. Over. We have a Code 3 toxic spill, Riverside and Figueroa. Requesting all available units to assist in evacuation. - Put me on route. - Roger. - See you, Phil. - What about Mr. Elias? L'm gonna have to take a pass on Mr. Elias. - Thanks, anyway. - Take it easy. - Step back. - Coming through. - Got any people back there? - Clear. What's going on? This tanker was involved in an accident. Lt jackknifed and started leaking some kind of toxic substance. The driver fled. We have no idea what the substance is or where it came from. - L know that smell. - Get a gas mask. - Lt's the same as the Nu-Knit factory. - L don't smell anything. Lt doesn't affect you guys. Remember? L'm telling you, this stuff came from the Nu-Knit factory. - They find Smith yet? - L'm expecting to hear any moment. Matt, maybe we should wait until we get... the Department of the Environment test results. L trust your nose, trust mine. Nu-Knit's dumping waste illegally. And l'll bet you it ties in with Poe's death. Nu-Knit's dumping waste illegally. And l'll bet you it ties in with Poe's death. Our company. Grazer's company. Yeah, it's gonna spoil his day. This is just like my car. This spill is like your car? All these nifty things we want... they wind up costing us a lot more than we think. This is One-Adam-Six. Come in, One-William-52. This is 52. Over. We are at Lee Smith's residence. The suspect is not on the premises. Roger, One-Adam-Six. L bet you l know where that lovebird is. God, Lee. Don't worry, honey, l'll post bail on this pollution thing... - and l'll be out tonight. - Not if we nail you on Murder One. - L had nothing to do with Edgar's death. - No. Your prospectus claimed... that the Department of the Environment gave you a clean bill of health. Clearly, it wasn't deserved. And Poe, being a scientist, would've been the first to discover that. Lf he intended to go public, that'd be awful bad for business. You had motive, Mr. Smith. Tell them the truth, Lee. We both know you didn't kill Edgar. Okay. Look... under the Department of Environment's laboratory conditions... Nu-Knit's by-product wasn't hazardous. Edgar realized that outside... in the air, mixed with Earth pollutants... Nu-Knit's by-product was deadly to humans. Like the leak at the factory. You experienced it. Of course l wanted to cover it up. L tried to protect my business, but l didn't kill Edgar. - Who else knew about this? - Besides myself, Rita. L don't know who else Edgar might have told. - Maybe our accountant, Cyril Roman. - Okay, let's go. What about the factory? - We're shutting it down tomorrow. - Do you have to do that? L'll pay the fines, whatever. You have as much to lose as anyone, and your captain. We're shutting it down. Smith's booked. - George, what happened to your vest? - L discarded it. - Matt, look at this. - George, the sun's almost up. L deserve a few hours sleep. Remember l told you l found two investors... who passed away before Nu-Knit was started? There's a third. Maybe their estates made the investments. No. l've traced all three through different brokerage houses... to the same holding company. Fleur de Lyon Enterprises. L'm bringing up its articles of incorporation. Cyril Roman's a busy boy. He's trying to gain control of Nu-Knit using these dummy investors. He would have the most to lose if Poe had gone public... and Nu-Knit had to shut down. Nu-Knit is closed by order of the Department of the Environment... until further notice. Please, leave the premises immediately. There's an exec here, Cyril Roman. He's a Newcomer. Lnside. Stop right there! Matt, stay clear of the fumes. L'll cover the front and call for back-up. George? Talk to me, George. Excuse me. My partner, what happened to him? Where is he? Lnside. George! George, where are you? George! George, where are you? George. Matt. Try, Matt. - Are you all right? - You? Thank you, Matt. Vessna and Emily are sleeping. So how did your investors meeting go? Your friend Marilyn was there. She played a prominent role. Dad, l'm sorry you guys lost your money... but the workers are the ones who really got hurt. L mean, they lost their jobs. Luckily, you might be wrong on both counts. Marilyn's group is preparing... a feasibility study on converting the factory... into a plastics recycling plant. Naturally, it will include a profit-sharing plan for the workers. We wouldn't see a return for two years, but at least we'd still be in business. That's terrific. Marilyn's great. Yes, she's the best thing since diced bread. At least with Marilyn, you won't be running a sweatshop. He's passionate, sincere... he's committed. He's also a royal pain in the ass. Francisco. Good morning, Captain. What's this l hear about Nu-Knit becoming a plastics recycling factory? That's correct. - Any money in it? - Plastics? Yeah. Have another. - Good morning, Albert. ls Matthew in yet? - L haven't seen... Here l am. Albert, come here. - L got something for you. - For me? Yeah. You can come, too, George. Come on. What a great day. - You seem happy, Sgt. Sikes. - Uncharacteristically so. I am happy, Albert. Very happy. - Because of the car? - Sort of, yeah. - Ls it running well? - L wouldn't know. l sold it. L bought you these, Albert. L thought they'd kind of dress up the city. L got 10 more trucks like these. You just tell them where you want them. Trees! Yeah. Aren't they fine?
