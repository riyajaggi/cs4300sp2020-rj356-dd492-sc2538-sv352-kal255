 - DEA! Hold it! - Don't move. Hands up! Drop your guns! On your knees now! Hands up! Cuff him! Make it hurt! Stop resisting! - God damn it, stop resisting. - Hey! The pilot's making a run for it! - Jesus. - Shit! God damn it! Kiki, come on! Come on, come on. I don't think so, ese. Hold on, Kiki! Whoo! My kind of Tuesday night! Hands up! So what do you figure? I think six million. Can't find no files, though. Yeah, you know what? This is going to work just fine. Welcome, sir. Someone new. Your drink, sir. Your member number? I don't have one. I'm a guest. Here. Here. I wouldn't call it my cup of tea, either. I'm looking for a Mr. Zuno Arce. There's lots of stories about Sinaloa. They say they're finally gonna pave the streets. I was born here in Mexico City. It was a different time, though. Less complicated. But what can we do? Reminisce about the past? I'd rather play tennis, even though I'm fat and have bad knees. Or we could discuss the future. In my line of work, certain opportunities are opening up. And that's why I'm here. I wanted to talk about a proposition... - You know, I was in Sinaloa once. - I'm sorry? I went to a really good restaurant there. The heads on these shrimp were like... The woman I was with, I wasn't married at the time, I think she enjoyed it less than me. I can't remember the name... of the restaurant. - My love... - The woman I do remember. Well, then. It was a pleasure, Félix. Wait... Ruben! Don't putt without me. How'd it go? Let's see. I pay you a million dollars for an introduction, not for you to be out here fucking around. What the fuck was that? Your introduction. My uncle, he does things a certain way, all right? He didn't listen. He didn't hear my proposal. Don't worry. I told him. You told him. Then why the fuck am I here? What did you tell him? The basics, anyway. Look, I have shipments arranged. Planes coming here. I can't wait. There's no time. I can't wait for your uncle's ways. I need an answer today! It doesn't work that way. - This kind of deal takes time. - How long? How long? Let me understand. You thought you could partner with them off a pitch? No, no, no. These people are going to look into everything you've ever done. And then they're gonna decide whether your organization can protect them. Whether this partnership can stay discreet... How long? - How long?! - It's the fucking government. Who knows? If you're so worried about time, why don't you talk with your Colombian friends? Push the deal. You're going to tell me how to run my business? Think about it. I would have done it already if I could. Then don't. Don't do it. But please, whatever you do, keep the noise down. People like my uncle, they don't like headlines. Now, if you'll excuse me. This shot's for par. Ready. Silver Cartier Panthère. It's beautiful. The shape of the diamond, the silver along the band, perfect against your skin tone. Is Cartier not perfect on some? May I try it? Of course. I'm sorry, it seems as though you already have this item. I don't have this beauty. Seems your husband ordered it for you last month. An easy mistake, with your collection. I suggest the Ballon Bleu. My husband purchased it? When? There. It's a mistake, ma'am. A mistake on our end. The purchase history for this customer begins here, ends here. You see? She's still learning. May I wrap that for you? Thank you, ma'am. Excuse me. You don't expect me to believe that story, do you? You aren't new. I've seen you here before. Please, ma'am, I don't want any trouble. Do you think I would forget an $8,000 watch? No. My husband ordered it. And I'd like to know for who. Please, I need this job. Then I'll give you an opportunity to keep it. I want a list of addresses to anywhere my husband's made orders. You know I can't give you that. Oh, I know you can. You go sightseeing? Been anywhere nice? The situation in Tijuana get resolved? Let's see. Falcón takes a load of our weed... and you shrug? - I pay you for protection. - Who could have predicted? That faggot Cuban suddenly interested in your little weeds... Yeah. Sorry, partner. Wish I could help, but my men are occupied with some leftists stirring shit up in Xalapa. - I can't pull them... - Then I'll handle it. All right, man. That Sinaloan dirtbag thinks he can cut a deal for coke and not discuss our terms first? Fuck him. - He's been in Mexico City, boss. - Yeah, I know, I know. Let's see how all this plays out. Renegotiate when it's settled. Put my money on the winner. Let's go. Hey, Ramon. Did your sister lend you that shirt? - Or they paying you to wear that shit? - Asshole. Well, I like it. What's not to like? This shit's expensive, bro. Won't catch me in it. Company would have to pay me to wear that gay shit. Who the fuck's gonna pay your short ass to wear anything? Excuse me. Wouldn't mind getting paid to carry one of these bad boys around. - Yes? - How'd the meeting go? I didn't get an answer. We got shipments being coordinated, Miguel. You think I don't know that? What can I do? They want to vet the organization, make sure their participation can be protected. How long do they need? Didn't say. Well, I spoke to the brothers. Benjamín's got a soft spot for the Cuban, but I reminded him of where he's from, what we've done for him. And? They don't want to be involved, but they're on our side. Fucking brats. We have a problem with the DFS. I noticed. Nava's withholding his men. He knows about Colombia. Can you handle this without them? It's Tijuana. I could get a guy to kill Rafa and Chapo for under 200 bucks. No, wait, Don Neto. Wait, man. At least till I'm there. I don't want to miss that. Worry about your government friends. I'll handle this. We have Tijuana under control. Just keep it quiet, Neto. What are you talking about, man? I'm quiet by nature. This dude. Gonna need your help. Get us out of this jam. Yes, sir. Chapo says the Cuban has an army. We need more men. - More men? - We gotta buy local. Sounds good. Don't forget, you're dropping Scarlett off at school today. I have my Jazzercise class at 11:00. I already told her she gets to ride with Daddy this morning. You know how much shit Daddy has to do today? Well, if he wants to fuck Mommy at all this week, he's going to drop her off at school. Okay? No, baby. We're taking Magnum today. Good morning. Hey. What, no kiss? What do we always say? - Hook 'em horns. - Hook 'em horns. Go get 'em. Thomas. Still waiting on that phone call. Oh. You're not under arrest. Then what the fuck is this? It's just an opportunity to help each other out. Look, I'm not saying a fucking word until my lawyer's here, pal. You're wasting your own damn time not giving me that phone. Man. For moving all that money, you sure ain't that smart. My boy just told you you're not under arrest. Then I'm asking to leave. Okay. I mean, I thought you'd be safer here. I mean, after Félix hears how you did him... Uh-huh. And, uh, how would that be? You heard about the plane that went down, outside of Sunland Park this morning? They seized, um... ...$6 million. Financial documents. - I mean, that paper trail is long. - Yeah. Unlikely. So you haven't heard about it. Uh... Did we file that report with the El Paso PD? - I didn't file shit. - Oh, you didn't? - No. - Fuck. You know what? Come to think of it, neither did I. I guess that isn't public information yet. But when I do file that report, I'm going to put down how I got the jump on that plane. You see, I got this CI. He's like some, you know, asshole banker type. He just turned snitch about eight months ago. Check it out. You know what I call him? Longhorn Thomas. Now, I like that. Kind of sounds like this asshole right here. Yeah, it does sound like you, because you went to UT, right? And your name is Thomas. Ooh. That is a bad coincidence. I will sue you for defamation if you try. Take your badge, your government salary, anything else in your shitty little life I feel like. Yeah. See, the problem is, the guys that you work for, they're not really courtroom types. How long do you think this guy will last when the cartel finds out that he's been feeding intel to the DEA? Well, after I leak his address, drop his name in a few of my reports, not long. - Yeah, not long. - Yep. What do you want? I want Félix to pay you a visit. Today. - In El Paso? - Yes. Oh, come on. No fucking way. This guy covers every angle, dots every fucking "i." You think he's going to risk his freedom over some bullshit doc I desperately need him to sign? When Félix hears that a pilot error is going to lead the DEA into seizing $47 million in his American bank account, yeah, I think he might. Thomas... Let your money work for you. Isn't that what you tell your clients? What do you do when your drug protection decides to sit on the sidelines? Easy. You buy more. STATE POLICE HEADQUARTERS And everyone knows the best deals in Mexico... are in Tijuana. Call it Costco for corruption, where you buy in bulk. Why buy a few local cops when you can have the whole goddamn force? Quickly! Hurry! On the floor. Quickly. On the floor! Where's my fucking weed? Hands behind you! Cochiloco. Look there. Nothing. Let's take a look. What the fuck? I told you to try not to kill anyone. I was doing him a favor. - You see the kind of pain he was in? - Shit. It's here. He didn't touch any of it. And now it's yours again. All in a day's work. But my plants have been through a lot. A lot! So let's get 'em home! It was here. Let's go. We're just gonna leave 'em? Come on, Neto... let me handle it. You want to send Falcón a message? Send him one. Make sure he's gonna see it. I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Zuno's unavailable at the moment. May I take your message? This is Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo. It's urgent that Mr. Zuno return my call. I'll certainly pass the message along, sir. Thank you. They burned everything, sir. The art, the trucks. There's nothing left. It's time to put those monkeys in their place. Make the call. Yes, sir. I hate to say it, but I kept telling you, Jaime. Your team was reaching, making a lot of noise. And just like that, we're down a man. Well, luckily, no one got hurt. Go ahead. File this one. Intel seems light this week, Jaime. The noise outside of Knapp's did more than just rattle the folks back in DC. I mean, we can't seem to pay the people down here enough to even be interested in talking to us. And what's this? Fingerprints. Lifted from a crime scene in El Paso. We didn't get a hit on our database, so I thought maybe you could run it through yours. It's a long story, really. I mean, I just... I'd appreciate the favor on this one. I love long stories. So, go ahead. A plane that might be associated with traffickers missed the runway outside El Paso last night. Fucking idiot landed in a state-sponsored agricultural field. Real amateur. Now we got a couple of Mexican nationals in custody. Pretty sure they're giving us fake names. Jose Cuervo and Fernando Valenzuela, so yeah, I'm pretty sure too. Gentlemen, what was on the plane? About $6 million and a few documents. Financials mostly. It's early to just say how relevant they are. Look, the El Paso office is sending the files down now. If you want, I can get copies to you tomorrow afternoon. Great. How long before you think they realize those are my fingerprints? Assuming they don't wind up in the trash, I'd say right about the time Félix Gallardo winds up in American custody. What happened? We got a problem, brother. A big fucking problem. I'm a little busy. What's up? One of your pilots, Raul... Raul Espinosa. Familiar with this asshole? I don't know. I have a lot of pilots. What's the problem? He's in American custody. Brings down $6 million into a fucking grain field last night. You want to make this any easier on them? The police took the money? Fuck the money. Your accounts, Félix, they're vulnerable. All of them. Vulnerable how? What does this plane have to do with my fucking accounts? The documents on board. Account numbers, deposit history, fucking bank addresses. The kind of shit these DEA assholes look into. Miguel... these documents tie together, the DEA gets a warrant into one... Then move it! All of it, you have my authorization. I can't. I need your signature. I need you to come up here. Today. No. It's not possible. If you don't get your ass on a plane this afternoon, the Feds will be the ones knocking on my door next. And every law enforcement agent in the US is gonna know your name. You think he went for it? What have you heard about one of my planes being taken down in Texas? Well... yes, sir. I spoke to the agents here in Guadalajara. Is it true? What happened? I believe several million dollars were taken. And your men. What else? Excuse me? What else was on that plane? What does the DEA have? I've been told there were some kind of financial documents on board, sir. I would like to ask you, what would you like us to do... Hello. Sir? Motherfucker. Beautiful painting. A 19th century piece by Saturnino Herrán. One of the two by the artist during his Expressionist period. May I see the other? Already sold. Someone with a good eye. It's a gift for my husband. He has better taste for this sort of thing. Art is about emotion. What your intuition dictates. After all, you'll be the one looking at it. How far along are you? Six months. I'll take it. I'll get it ready. Look, miss, I just need to know if Mr. Zuno received my messages. That's all. I'm sorry, sir. Like I told you... Please tell him it's urgent. Yes, sir. I will tell him. Turn it up, brother. Fuck with my weed... fuck with me... I kill you. We came, we saw, we burned that shit down! So what's the deal? Let's get after it tonight. TJ's got some cool shit. Check it out. The brothers are back on the team. - Been here the whole time, baby. - Wouldn't mind seeing some girls. - Yes, girls. - Fuck, yes. We got girls. Light skin, beautiful. Like you. Just as long as the little guy can get it up, though, right? Hey, hey, hey. - Okay. Take it easy. - Calm down. Not here. - Come on, kid. - Another day. Good news here, brother. Got our bud back, easier than we thought. Any noise? Small industrial fire, nothing to do with us. Gonna take the boys out to celebrate, be back in the morning. You hear from our friends? Nothing. Maybe it's not your day, Miguel. You built something beautiful. Don't put it all on one wager. I call the Colombians, that goes away, Neto, forever. But Escobar's shipment lands without the government's support... No, Miguel. They'll come for your head. How's Rafa? He's happy. And the brothers? Neto? Neto, what is that? - What the fuck? - Might have a little situation here, gonna have to call you back. Wait, Neto. What kind of problem? A big one. Neto, the fuck is that? Told you Falcón was rolling with the army. - You said "an" army. - No! "The" army. Take out your guns, motherfuckers! Motherfucker. Don Neto! To the truck! Move it! Rafa! The truck! Get to the truck! - My weed! - Let's go! Wait, wait, wait. I'm coming in. Stay open tonight. Bye. Game on. Got it. Félix took the bait. Holy shit. You needed to speak to me? - What are you doing? - I'm at home. In Tijuana? What's on your mind, Félix? Falcón's become an issue. I need to put a stop to it. Well, what did you think? You broke your word to him. I didn't call for a lecture. Falcón can be managed. I can handle him. It's important this problem with him goes away tonight. I've been thinking about what you asked me in Colombia. What I wanted out of all of this. I want part of the plaza. I want 20 percent of Tijuana. Then earn it, sweetheart. Fix this, it's yours. Consider it done. All right, then. So Félix is going to approach the boarder by vehicle. When he gets to this point right here, Mexican customs is going to ask him for identification. Guys who have stopped no one in the history of the fucking border. As soon as he crosses this point here, he's going to be on American soil. Once he actually comes through customs, I want you to keep your eyes on him until he gets right here. At which point, the marshals take jurisdiction. So you guys, along with the assistance of the El Paso PD, track him from the border to the bank. As soon as he goes inside, along with those documents, Jim and I will make the arrest. Which means, first round's on the DEA after we bag this son of a bitch. Now, at any point, if Félix rattles and tries to make a run back to this here border, Marshals, you intercept. You make this fucking arrest. Look, we want him on bank fraud. But traveling on a fake passport? That'll do the trick just fine. Decide to put a bullet in this asshole's head? Well, that'll work too. Félix Gallardo crosses the border for the last time tonight. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Let's do it. Marshalls are in position, standing by. Over. Let her pass. Okay. Go ahead. We've got a possible target in sight. Third car back. Affirmative. Brown Volkswagen, single driver. Hoo-dee-hoo. Stop there! Identification, please. Huh? Your passport. This is it. Come to Papa. Okay, lower your arms. She's clean. Come on. Wow. Give me one second. What the fuck is taking this asshole so long? Yeah, what the fuck? I'm not liking this. Hey, kid, what's going on with my passport? Done? A call for you. The fuck are they doing? It was called La Maroma. That restaurant in Sinaloa, with the shrimp, you know it? Yes. Yes, La Maroma. I do. I apologize for the delay, Miguel. As you know, things here tend to work at their own speed. You have a deal. Good. That's good. And Félix? Don't cross the border. The gringos are waiting. Thank you. One more thing... What the fuck is going on? Looks like they ain't letting him through. You guys fucking seeing this? Yeah, we're fucking seeing this. I've got a clean shot. Should I take it? Negative. He's gotta be on American soil. Guys? Hasta luego. So you're finally on your knees for him. Expected more from you, Isabella. My mistake, not yours. - I'm here to make a deal with you. - What makes you so sure I'm interested? Because you're smart. And you know you'll lose. Will I? Alberto... I've never met anyone like him. He's only just beginning. - He's brainwashed you. - He hasn't. He's convinced me. Félix controls every plaza. In time, he will bleed you dry. He seems to want to make a deal, so today you have leverage. What's his offer? Ten million now. Two percent of everything that moves through Tijuana after. And if I say no? You won't. I hope you know the man you're dealing with. He'll lie. He'll lie to you, Isabella, like he did to me. Your answer, Alberto. - Fifteen million. - It's ten. And I need an answer. You're a cunt, Isabella. Such a cunt. Tell Félix... he has a deal. It's settled. Tony, come with me. Stop there. She's clear. Let her pass. Understood. Hey, what's this? What's this bullshit? Tony. Shit, Tony. You listening to me? I'm talking to you. Relax. All good. Be careful, boys, all good. I guess Félix made a better deal. You all right, kid? Yeah. You okay? Let's go home. - Those leather? - Yeah. Italian. God damn. - Those are slick. - Right? Maybe I'll get a pair. A Grand Caravan 208. How much can it hold? I don't know. Let's find out. Pablo says hi.
