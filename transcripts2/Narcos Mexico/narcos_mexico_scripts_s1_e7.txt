 [cheering and applause] [announcer speaking Spanish] [punching] [bell dings] [in Spanish] I thought things were starting... if I remember. Fucking bullshit, man. We ain't shake on that. With what my dad pays your ass? You can afford it. - Fine, take it. - That's right, bitch. Damn. Motherfucker had him in the fifth round. Don't start with that shit, man. He never had a chance.

 What would you know about it? "I don't know anything?" says the guy who loses every bet. What the fuck? Hey, asshole! That's my ride. - You're fucked now. - Go fuck yourself! Not so tough now. [grunts] Omar! Help me! [gunshot] [screaming] [Conjunto Hermanos Flores' "Duelo de Valientes" playing] [man in Spanish] Do you recognize this young man? Yes, that's my son. [sniffles]

 [Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing] [narrator in English] I never saw it for myself. But before shit went south, Guadalajara was the fucking place. It was where mariachi music was invented. Tequila too. That's enough to get a town into any country's top five list. Shit, maybe even to the number one spot. And those good times can be distracting. While you're dancing and singing and drinking, it's hard to see that bad shit's coming. [gunshot] [screaming] You never know until it hits you. So enjoy it while it lasts. Mucho gracias. [in English] This city is fucking amazing, man. I'm telling you, man. This place is a fucking paradise, man. I feel like we walked by this guy earlier. Mm. A lot of taco carts in Mexico, man. - Yeah, just admit it. We're lost. - No. No, no, no. Museo de las Artes is right around here. - Oh, a little fine arts? - Yes, exactly, man. That's what I'm talking about. Let the creative juices flow, my friend. - They say chapter three is the hardest. - You said that the last chapter. - I didn't want to discourage you. - [laughs] Shh. [in English] It's just a beautiful neighborhood. Two bedrooms outside the master. I'm not sure if you have any kids or not. Three. Including my husband. [chuckles] [man laughs] And is he going to be joining us? This place is priced to buy, and I'd hate for you to miss out because... While we wait on the decision-maker to weigh in? Don't worry. She's present and accounted for. Well, then let's get to what's really important. How 'bout that? It's perfect. So you said on the phone you were new to San Diego? Yeah, we've been down in Mexico for my husband's job, but we're coming back home now. Mexico, huh? Yeah, he's with the DEA. He's gotta have some stories, right? Tons. - Living room is over here? - Yeah. [Sears in English] It's all in the wrist, man. [Kiki] I am using the wrist. I hope you end up in Nebraska. [Sears] We have an office in Nebraska? If you saw what there was for people to do in Nebraska, you'd know we'd need an office. State Department's annual report on narcotics. - Oh, can't wait to read that. - [Jaime chuckles] "DEA estimates cocaine entering the United States surged by more than 60 percent between March and June, 20 percent above the previous quarter alone." - Yeah, but I bet seizures are up. - [Jaime sighs] Christ. This stuff's falling from the sky. No wonder their little buckets are getting wet. And here I thought Bush shut down the Caribbean. [Jaime] We did the best we could. Sometimes that's just the way it shakes out. [narrator in English] The numbers were staggering. By adding coke to his arsenal, Félix had changed the game. And his revenue changed with it. Because if you thought moving thousands of pounds of marijuana was bringing in money... well, this shit... white gold. [laughing] A better product in every way. The stuff sells for 15 times the price of weed. Packs at 60 percent to capacity. So what does that mean? It means the cartel was moving four tons a month. The fucking FedEx of blow. I'll save you a calculator. It made Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo untouchable. But change is always hard. You switch up your entire business... there's gonna be repercussions. [in Spanish] The trucks haven't arrived. Fuck! [narrator in English] One guy's loss... is another guy's gain. The one thing that never changes: everyone still wants their piece. [in Spanish] Where have you been? Been calling you. Had Cabinet Ministers call me back sooner. I've been busy. Oh, yeah? Well, I hate to add to your plate. But it's time we discussed our terms. You start moving new product, you start making new income... that means new payouts. Starting with me. Hey... Things are complicated right now. I have a few more mouths to feed. Then simplify. What the fuck are you talking about? Your new friends in the government? They eat at my table on Sundays. [chuckles] Don't think that by wearing that stupid suit, you suddenly become one of us. Without me, you don't exist. [elevator dings] Come up with a number. I won't ask you again. Isabella. [in Spanish] I'm glad that you came. [Isabella] I wasn't going to wait for you to return my call. Business is good. Yeah. And still, everyone has their problems. Some people make it difficult. Why I need more like you. Just got back from Tijuana. I paid a visit to the brothers. Making money, hand over fist. But they didn't seem to be aware of our understanding. I've yet to receive my end. You spoke to the brothers? [Isabella] I inquired as to what they'd been told. Okay, then. I understand your concern. But it's important we give this thing time. "This thing"? "This thing" that we built? I think it's important that be made clear to the others. When have I done you wrong? Tell me. There's more changes to come for things to improve, but you have to be patient. With Sinaloans in charge? I thought we were resistant to change. I just want what I was promised. [elevator dings] [in English] Excuse me, señorita. Tony? [in Spanish] You have a new boss? [in English] Yeah. That's right. [Félix in Spanish] How is he? You know the old man. [Félix] Don Neto. [sighs] So sorry. There are no words, brother. He was 20 years old. And I missed almost all of them. [whimpers] [sobs] Wanted to be a lawyer, you fucking believe that? Since he was a kid. To make sure I was always protected. [sobs] You are. Let him leave with that comfort. He fucking died on the street. Died on the street like a dog. [sobs] How I protected him. [sobs] Don Neto. With crisis comes opportunity. Your pain? Find where it lives, kill it. What kind of bullshit is that? The truth. [chuckles] There are problems with the business. Nava wants an increase on his end. And Juárez... still worries me. Acosta's methods are dated. His infrastructure isn't there. Makes things difficult. The product is moving... but I want our numbers to grow. We have to check up on each plaza... to make sure they're doing things right. I've called the Colombians, made it clear we can handle more. I can't fuck it up now. Your nephew, Amado, I know he has some ideas. And Rafa... Where does he fit in? [club music playing] [in Spanish] What did one butt cheek say to the other? What? Cover your ass. [laughing] That was funny, right, Rafa? [Chapo] What do you think, Rafa? You look incredible. You look like shit. [laughs] This guy bothering you? [chuckles] What's up, bro? Didn't think this was your scene. - You guys come together? - Rafa, relax. We're just dancing. - Relax. We're all having a good time. - Not talking to you, asshole. - [Sofia] Rafa, calm down. - Shut up! [Amado] No! Hey! Hey! Was just closing that, man. She's my girl. Stay the fuck away. Still? Sorry, bro, I didn't know. If I did, I'd only fuck her harder. What? Want to dance? [Amado] Need a kiss? [Rafa laughs] Everything okay? [gunshots] - [screaming] - [gunshots] Relax, Rafa. Relax. Take it easy. Take it easy, Rafa. Not here. - [Rafa] Let's get the fuck out of here. - [Chapo] Let's go. [video game music playing] [Kiki in English] Fuck. Kikito! Playtime's after dinner, okay? [Kiki] Hey! Come on. But I hate fish sticks. I want mac and cheese. Go. Take it to the table. Go put on a shirt. Okay. [Kikito] Why can't we go where Mom is? I want to be with Mom. You know what? Mom's going to be home very soon, okay? Then we're going to move to San Diego together. That means you've caught all the bad guys? Just... [sighs] Can you just eat, please? Stupid. [gunshots] [Kiki] Go to your room, mijo. [dog barking] [Félix in Spanish] Are you out of your fucking mind? You know what happens if you'd hit someone in that club? You know who goes to that club? Rich kids. Families that fucking mean something. And take off those glasses. [Rafa chuckles] My father used to give me that look. You already know what I think of that asshole. The thing with you and Amado, it has to stop. It will... when I kill him. [Rafa laughs] What's with you and that guy, anyway? That guy... just happens to be Neto's nephew. In other words, your business partner. - He works for you. - No, he works for you. You don't give a shit about the thing we built. Well... Don't worry, nothing changes. We're not substituting your product. - We're adding a new one, that's it. - So why is no one moving my product? Then why the fuck haven't you been to the field, man? For two months? Three? If you'd been there, you'd know it's all fucking rotting. Just sitting there. No one's fucking moving it! My sinsemilla put you where you're standing. None of this other shit happens without it. You think I don't know that? I know. I need you, man. Then get rid of Amado... or I will. Oh, gracias. [in English] Thank you very much. Gracias. That's the grand torta I was telling you about. Grand indeed. [Kikito] Man, this is delicious. You like those, huh? [Kiki laughs] [Kikito] No more fish sticks. [chuckles] You excited Mom's coming home? [Kikito] Obviously. [door closes] [Kikito] Dad. - Who is it? - [Kiki] Wait right there. Félix! - [engine turns over] - I'm talking to you, motherfucker! [horn honks] [in English] Can we talk for a second? - Yeah. - [Kiki] Somewhere else? Sure. [Félix] Maria? [in Spanish] I'm going to Sinaloa. What? Where are the children? With my mom. I sent them this morning. It's better they not see you. Wait. Maria. Maria, wait! What's going on? You spend the evening with her? [Félix] Huh? We came by the hotel. You were with her. Isabella. Isabella? [chuckles] You're kidding. I've known her since she was a girl. She's like my niece. She's part of this business. What about the others? They're also a part of this business? The girl at the gallery... She's pregnant, asshole. Maria? Maria! - Go away. - Maria, wait! Come here. Get you fucking hands off me! [panting] - [Félix] Maria, stop! - No! Fucking listen to me! Enough! Stop, damn it! Enough. [Maria panting] You're the most important person in my life. Is that clear? But you aren't the same. And I'm leaving. [both breathing heavily] [whispers] I want to fix this. I want to fix this. Then come back to Sinaloa. [Maria] This business has become your life. - No, no, no. - Yes. This is our business. It's ours. It's for you. It's yours. What can I do? You've made the agreement with the Colombians. You made a deal with them. You can run this business from anywhere. Come home. [in English] I don't like that smile. Hola, Fredo. What up, gringo? Hey, can we buy you a drink? Sure. Why not? Great. We'll follow you. [Fredo in English] I help you out on this, what are you going to do? I mean, how high is it going to go? [sighs] All the way to the top. I heard one of your CIs got killed a little while back. Yeah. It's dangerous, the noise we'd be generating. You've heard the news of the eradication program, right? [Fredo] Agricultural Department is rolling it up. Planes are being sent over to Belize. [laughs] Belize? Yeah, because they've got such a problem down there. [Jaime] Jesus Christ. How long have you put into that program? Four years. Oh. - Four years of your life into something. - [Fredo] Yeah. Everything you've got. For what? You can help us do something about it. [indistinct chatter] [video game sounds] [in Spanish] Hey, kid, need to go to Guadalajara. - Boss called a meeting at the hotel. - [Ramon] For what? No idea. Just said to be there. [Hector] Boss called a meeting. At the hotel. - Did he say why? - [Hector] No. [Chapo] Said he wants to talk at the hotel. Did he say why? [man] Just wants to talk. [man] He'd like you to attend. [El Azul] Something about "reorganization." Says he'll explain everything there. [Nava] Finally, that fucker is coming around. [crickets chirping] [radio announcer in Spanish] [Mika in English] Where are you going? Oh. I'm going for a run. [Mika chuckles] You're the worst liar I know. That's because I never do, baby. What are you up to? Something I got to do. Work? Sort of. [Mika] Kiki, we leave in a week. - You told me you were done. - Well, and I will be. This about the Wizard of Oz? Whatever it is you're doing, are you sure it's a good idea? You said it yourself, no one wants to hear it. [Kiki] I just... I know that I just can't leave this place... without that motherfucker knowing my name. He has to. [vehicle approaching] [in Spanish] What, Fredo? - Putting in overtime? - Better than putting up with my wife. [laughs] [Kiki in English] Don't you need some sort of lights to take off? [Zavala] Nope. Don't get nervous on me now. I'm counting on you to handle the camera, Kiki. Don't worry, I got it. [inhales] [inhales] [grunts] Ah! [in Spanish] Let's go, we're taking a ride. [Sammy] Sure, boss. Where should I take you, sir? To see the man who killed my son. [engine turns over] [Omar in Spanish] Make sure you scrub hard. - Are we almost finished? - Yes. Then we'll go out and enjoy the rest of the day. Keep drying that side. There's still a lot of soap. - Here? - Yeah. Hector... that's enough. Amalia? Get your stuff and take him to your mom's. [car doors close] How are you, Omar? [Don Neto] Have to decide what's important in this life. Before you wake up... and it's gone. Course, me sitting here with you proves I'm too late. Do you know why I'm here? [whimpers] Yes. I'm so sorry, sir. I'm sorry about what happened. For everything I've done. I loved Gilberto so much. Do you believe in God? No. - I don't. - Neither do I. As a child, I did. It's important, I think, to believe when we're young. Would you agree? Yes. But do you know who I worshipped even more than God? Jesús Malverde. Sound familiar? From Sinaloa. Or so the legend goes. I liked hearing his story more. It may as well have been my own. Born in the fields, to a family with nothing. His parents lived a clean life, did what they could, but one day, things changed. He was young. No choice but to steal. They called him a thief, a bandit. Offered rewards for his capture. He only took what he needed. Gave everything to the poor. Loved by the people. Until one day he was shot. By a friend... who wanted the reward. Took his body to the governor, who hung him in town for everyone to see. Forbidden to bury him... leaving his body to rot, as an example to all of what happens to outlaws. His remains falling to the ground, little by little, the people covering the body with rocks, until he was gone. Rock after rock... until all that remained was a shrine built of stone. Worshipping him. Because even in sin, you can still be a saint. Gilberto loved you. [Omar sobs] Loved you like a brother. I loved him a lot as well. He was like my brother. He would've wanted me to come. I forgive you. I forgive you, my son. Gilberto would've wanted me to forgive him... but I'd never forgive myself if I let the man who killed my son live. Kill him. [Félix in Spanish] Look around the room, what do you see? Consider where we started and where we sit today. We got into this business with the hope of great fortune. For our families, for our children... And it was here... that I asked you to put your business in my hands. That with our leverage of superior supply and our country-wide distribution, we would dominate the market. We underestimated ourselves. Now we have more money than we can ever spend. You didn't come dressed this way last time. [laughs] Fucking Acosta. But show me the man who's happy with what he has... and I'll show you the fool. Hey. Business is changing and we must change with it. I'll be making some adjustments to the organization... specifically to management. Héctor Palma will now be running operations in Mazatlan. And Juárez... we're sending you Amado. Under your guidance and with his vision for the future... that plaza will take on new significance. Tijuana... Tijuana stays the same. The Arellano Félix brothers will continue to oversee operations. The future is here... and that future is cocaine. [Acosta] I'm with the kid. "All of us don't sign on, our 'federation' falls apart." Isn't that what you said?! [Félix] Not anymore. Who made the deal with the Colombians? I made the deal. No one else. Whoever doesn't agree can get the fuck out of here. We're good then. So let's toast to the boss of bosses! - Cheers. - [all] Cheers. [Jaime in English] It's, uh... just outside of Guadalajara. A few hundred miles at most. In the state of Zacatecas. By our estimation, it's over 1,000 acres. That's the largest marijuana grow in history. By anyone's estimation. What's your point? What are you looking to get out of all of this, hmm? [Kiki] I'm trying to do my job. See, you can't ignore this and neither can the Mexican government. What I want to see is change. [Kiki scoffs] This is the most backward fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. [Jaime] Kiki. Why don't you excuse us a moment, Agent Camarena? Door. - What the fuck, Jaime? - Sit down, Ed. Sit down. Ed, it just fell in our laps. What do we do with this? Understand me? What do we do with this? [sighs] Nothing. - If this got out... - [Jaime] Ed's right. If the press caught wind that we had this and we buried it, given the First Lady's stance? [exhales] I imagine that would be a pretty bad look. For all of us. And how would that happen? [Jaime] It's Mexico, Ed. Who the fuck knows? [chuckles] [Jaime] Ed. [Jaime sighs] [Jaime] God damn. Well? Well, Ed's about fit to spit. What are they going to do? [Jaime] The only thing they can do. They're going to hit it, Kiki. They're going to burn that fucking thing down. You wanted them to listen. Well, they heard you loud and clear. - When are they going to do that? - Um... Two weeks. Maybe less. I don't know. It's not like we can just ask the MFJP for help. [chuckles] No, no, no. We gotta do this one right. It's going to take some time. [Jaime sighs] I'm in San Diego in less than a week. The new transfer kicks in. [Jaime] Shit. Forgot about that. Hey, you still get the win. All right? Your name is on this and everyone's going to know it. Kiki. You did enough. Let's go get a beer. [Félix in Spanish] You're upset. Reorganizing the plazas? Said it yourself... [scoffs] ...Sinaloans are resistant to change. I didn't hear my name. You lied to me. I'm not sure that's true. Give it some time. A role will emerge with the Arellano Félix brothers. I want what I was promised. - Twenty percent. - Isabella... You gave me your word. - Said if I handled Falcón... - But you didn't. I handled him. And if your partners found out? What you did, how it was handled? If I were to tell them? Be careful what you're saying. Be careful what I'll do. Look at me. You'll take what I give you... or have nothing at all. Understood? [Kikito growling] [in English] What are you doing there? Come on. We're setting the table. So are you going to tell me or what? What? How'd it go? Oh, uh... They took our intel and said they were going to act. And? We're going to take the fields. [Mika] Mmm. - You did it, Agent Camarena. - [Kiki chuckles] Going out with a bang. Hmm. Yeah. And, uh... Jaime said that, uh... it'll probably take a couple weeks. You know, so I'm gonna need a little bit more time. [Mika sighs] - [Mika] I'm not doing this on my own. - [Kiki] Mika. - What? - Wait. What? What's more important? This or your family? When is it finally enough, Kiki? [Kiki] Mika! [piano music playing] [in Spanish] Hey. - You pack everything? - Yes. It's time for us to go home. You know me better than anyone. I knew we would be able to fix this. Together. [Maria sighs] You were right. I have changed. This is my home. My life is here. And I'm not going back to Sinaloa. You'll be fine. I don't need you anymore. [in Spanish] Cuco? Have you seen Neto? - [Cuco] What the fuck, man? You came. - Have you seen Neto? No. Went to his house and he wasn't there. Glad you came, Rafa. You heard from Neto? [Cochiloco] Old man has a lot on his plate right now. Why don't I fill yours up? [laughs] You gotta try this shrimp. Straight from Mazatlan. Not hungry. Just give me a beer. Take that one. You want to do some coke? Fuck yeah, I wanna do some coke! - But what are they really saying? - Man, just shut the fuck up! [Rafa] You don't turn your back on family. He prefers planes? Fuck him! Weed gives us reasoning. - Weed is life. - Cocaine is good, too. [Cochiloco] We're flying in fresh seafood from Mazatlan. Met a guy with his own airplane. Gets the shrimp early... Don't talk to me about fucking airplanes! [man 1 in English] This is it, right here. I'm telling you, man. You gotta try the carnitas. They are the best in the city. Thank you so much. Gracias. Ah, yeah. So good it's closed. Fuck. Shit. What about over here? - Sinaloan-style seafood? - Exactly. - Really? - Come on, man. - I was kinda feeling carnitas. - You never want to try anything new. How you gonna be a writer if you don't want adventure? Oh, man, I know how things go when it's an adventure with you. No, listen. Think of it this way. It's all you can eat, I imagine, because it's Mexico. - All right. Now you're talking. - It's cheaper. And Sinaloan seafood is considered the best. - In all of Mexico. Everyone knows. - Portions look large. [man 1] Not all gringos know this. - [man 2] I'm not a gringo. - [man 1] We are completely gringos. [man 2] All right, I'm a gringo. But you're a gringo too. [man 2] Is it even open? [in Spanish] We're tourists from the United States. Thank you so much. - [in English] We're good, man. - [man 2] Nice. See, this place... this place is fucking authentic. Yeah, like that mural. Yeah, man, you know what? You know what, right here? That's our monologue in chapter two. Gracias. That's our monologue in chapter two. A painting the guy sees on the wall. Yeah, yeah. Write that down. I don't think they stay fresh. Look at these fucking guys. [Cuco] They're Americans, man. They're writing your name, Rafa. - Could they be DEA? - They're DEA? They're cops, Rafa. [Cochiloco] They're the assholes that were outside my house. You motherfuckers! Lock the doors! What the fuck are you writing?! [Cochiloco] You're fucking cops! [overlapping yells] [gunshot] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - We're Americans! - [gunshot] [grunting] [grunts] [grunting] Move, motherfucker! Turn him over. [Rafa grunting] [Nava in Spanish] "The boss of bosses." Very... Very moving speech. I was very impressed. So eloquent. But I didn't hear shit, as far as my take. You want to discuss your price, set an appointment with my secretary. Fuck your secretary. Fuck your secretary. Fuck your mother. Fuck your dog. I'm the one that gives you orders. You understand, asshole? [grunting] [panting] [grunts] [elevator dings] Someone has a problem with this... they know where to find me.
