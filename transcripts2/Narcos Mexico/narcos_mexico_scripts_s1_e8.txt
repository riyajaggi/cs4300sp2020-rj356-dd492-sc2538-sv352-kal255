 - How are you? - Thanks for coming. Would you look at that? Never seen that much marijuana in one place. I imagine there's never been that much in one place. Yeah, state of the art irrigation systems, got barracks for 7,000 workers, a mess hall, warehouses for processing and storage... all in the middle of the fucking desert. How does that happen? I think you know how it happened, sir. There were stories of people hundreds of miles away feeling a little funny that afternoon. But not Rafael Caro Quintero. In 1984, total US marijuana consumption was estimated at 15,000 metric tons. His field held one third of it. Five thousand motherfucking tons. Caro Quintero had built the greatest weed farm in the history of modern agriculture. Perfectly engineered to maximize profit, he even timed the harvest for March. Why? spring break. And in the end, they got it all. - The largest seizure in history. - Two and a half billion. I mean, there were oil fields in Saudi Arabia worth less. Time Magazine called it "the Bust of the Century." You like that? DEA sure as hell did. Four years of having their asses handed to them. They handed it all back. With interest. And for the first time, the Thin Man was vulnerable. Not even a call? They raid my field and not a fucking word from you? The gringos back-channeled it, used the military, no cops. This is fucked. Fucked, Azul. It was inconvenient timing with Nava disappearing. Yeah. And you got a fucking promotion. I just don't want this kind of fuck-up happening again. Not on my end. But you got fancier friends than me. - Maybe they should warn you sooner... - No! Wait. You're here just to do your job, Azul. That's it! Are we clear? How's it going? Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here. What's up, Neto? How you holding up? Hanging in there. One day at a time. Fucking Americans. Slipped one through. Motherfucker. You look worse than me. You want a drink? What I want is to kill all those motherfuckers. Yeah. They hit us hard. No way around that. El Azul says it won't happen again, right? We don't have to act like we're stupid. We know this is how things go in this business. But even with all this, it doesn't matter. We've doubled our profits. And once our new distribution system's up, we could see five times that. But it's very important right now more than ever to be alert and quiet. Discreet. We can't afford anymore unwanted attention, is that clear? Yes. Rafa! Rafa! What's wrong? What's wrong, man? You want to know what's wrong? You handle Amado by giving him a promotion in Juárez. They burn my field and it's the cost of doing business. - That's what's wrong. - Look, Rafa... No more bullshit, Félix. I get it, man. Our farms are in Colombia now, I get it. We're done with weed. No problem. No problem? I know about what you did in the restaurant. - They were after me. - They were tourists, Rafael! - We cleaned it up. - Are you stupid or what? Don't you realize how fucking stupid that was? I can't count on you like this. I wasn't even going to invite you to this meeting. I don't recognize this thing anymore. Yes. - Everything we built went to shit. - No, no, no. You're the one going to shit. And I need you to get your head on straight. Got it? Our friend is having a rough time, huh? Can we talk? Acosta's going to be pissed about all the money he lost on that raid. And he was on the fence to begin with. Talk to him like your uncle. He's old school. Brother... my uncle never killed a man and dragged him through town behind a pickup. Listen, Amado, I need Juárez to ramp up distribution. Do you want to be a boss or not? Then go up there and talk to that motherfucker. Okay! But what do I tell him about the raid? That's what I don't know! Do I have to tell you how to do everything? Just fucking fix it! All right, then. Gotta think we finally got under that motherfucker's skin, huh? Two-point-five billion doesn't, nothing will. So Minneapolis, huh? You're gonna stick out like a sore thumb over there, buddy. - Too much brown in me now. - Yeah, I know. - Right there, right there. - Oh, yeah, no. Those freckles are huge! - Hey, baby. - Hey. - Are they ready? - Yeah. How are those burgers looking, boys? Why are you smiling like that? That, gentlemen, was Ed Heath on the phone. Turns out... we won some hearts and minds in DC. Uh-huh. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is sending down two investigators tomorrow to talk to us, open up all our files on the whole cartel. Oh! - Holy shit! - Oh! That's what I'm fucking talking about! Yeah, motherfucker! All right. All right. Let's not get too excited, okay? Oh, no! As much shit as we've eaten on this thing? Come on! To the biggest take in the history of the DEA. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. And smoke it. And smoke it. Ah. Hey, man, help yourself. What the fuck, man! I'm done with that shit, Cuco. That shit took Sofia. That shit took my field. - It's over, man. - We can't quit just like that. A friend of mine gave it up and almost went crazy. I have to get the devil out of me. He's been waiting, Mr. Félix. We need to talk. My uncle and his associates are concerned. This raid at Zacatecas... got a lot of attention. Hold on. You warn us half an hour before the raid and now you're going to tell me you're concerned? Didn't you say marijuana didn't matter to them? We just didn't anticipate that reaction. And you, my friend, shouldn't have built a field you can see from the fucking moon. All it took was some piece of shit pilot and a DEA agent to snap a couple of pictures and cause a shit storm in Mexico City. The Attorney General's asking questions. He already spoke to your uncle? Not yet. They're old friends, of course. The old man's honest. And my uncle is very careful. And let me tell you, friend... the gringos had a wire. They were listening to your entire operation. We took care of that, don't you worry. And how can we know what they've heard? Listen... if they had something else, we would know by now, don't you think? I just hope there's nothing involving my uncle. If it comes to light that you're in business together... I know. Of course. Although, you know well... there's only one way to be sure what this fucking agent knows. You understand? No. Let's see if you understand me. That shit you're thinking about? It's not going to happen. Okay? Félix. You people are constantly grabbing people off the street. Yes, but not a fucking DEA agent. We aren't stupid. That's like shooting yourself in the foot, man! And then they'll come back ten times harder. And then tell your uncle to hide, because it'll shine a light on everything. So you won't do it? Listen... you shouldn't even be asking me. Well... I'll talk to my uncle. Wait. I think it's better if I talk to him myself. No, Félix. You know that's not how this works. I'll talk to my uncle. And then I'll let you know what he says. Hmm? Hello? Give me one second. Félix is on the line. I'm sorry. He's gone for the day. Could I make an appointment to meet with him tomorrow? I'm sorry, his schedule's completely full. Listen to me. You're gonna tell him it's his associate from Guadalajara, and I'm coming to Mexico City tomorrow. And I'm coming just to see him. I'm guessing he probably doesn't want his colleagues to see me walk into his office. I have no problem. Hold one moment. Do you have a pen, Señor Félix? - Yes. - I'm going to give you an address. Go ahead. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Who is this? What else do you think those investigators are gonna want to see? They're gonna want to see everything, apparently. Good. We've done a lot of work these last four years. Now, finally, someone's going to see it. Shit. It feels like the Cubs winning the World Series. Oh, hell, like you would know what that feels like. Come on. Look, maybe it's because I'm leaving tomorrow or because I'm a born worrier, but... maybe all the shit we've been through down here is the universe telling us something. What the hell are you talking about? Maybe the field is enough. Maybe it's safer if we just drop our bats and walk off into the sunset. You do worry too much. But I'm going to miss you, little guy. - I'm going to miss you. - I'm not. - Damn. - Yeah, not me. I'm never going to visit you in fucking Minneapolis. Where's the boss? "The wind blew, and the evil witch appeared. She offers it to her. And Snow White goes... 'No, I won't take a bite of your apple.' 'Come on! Come on! Precious, give it just a small bite.'" We'll finish in a little while, sweetheart. Daddy needs to talk to Dopey here. What the fuck's going on down there? Why did we pay all that money to those motherfuckers, - if they're going to fuck us anyways? - Well... This is the kind of bullshit your boss guaranteed wouldn't happen. All right, all right. It was just a couple gringos. He's got it under control. It won't happen again. Listen to me. You'll be making so much money that you'll never run out. I promise you that. I don't listen to a bastard who pisses sitting down. I know you don't like this move to planes. But this change will make Juárez a much more important plaza. We're gonna be Félix's primary distributors. That's right. We get continuous coke shipments from Colombia, non-stop, and store it here. So it's always on hand, not scattered everywhere. We control the volume, but more importantly, the price. And if that happens, man, that bust... Hell, you won't even remember that fucking bust. But we have to get started now. So can we do this? You're head-to-toe full of shit, boy. But I want Félix's coke. Put your boots on. I'll see you at 8:00. Cuco! Cuco! Get more stuff. Get more stuff, asshole! Go! So the planes would come in, and we just need to figure out the right place to store the coke. Huh? Are you listening to me? So what do you think about the storage? Planes are for pussies. - What the fuck are we doing here? - Real business. Where's my fucking load? Boss, what happened was... We slid in a ditch, Don Pablo. Yes, and there were watermelons everywhere. They're mules. Lost a load hidden in a watermelon truck. We were driving toward the big tree and slid in the ditch. We hit a rock, boss. You remember where you left it? Yes, boss. You don't actually believe them? Could be a setup. Or they could just be very stupid. Either way... you're going to help me find that load. What the fuck? But you're the boss, man! Kill these motherfuckers. Send someone else to look for the truck. No boss, please! I don't send anyone to do shit I can do myself. And if they're telling the truth, I'd be shooting two innocent men. Let's go. - Let's go. - Come on, asshole. Move, asshole! - Good afternoon. - I know. Come with me. Wait here, please. Hi. Okay, great. Send them in. - Ready? - Yeah. All right. Hi there! Welcome. Come on in. - Thank you. - Good to see you. - This way. - Please, right this way. Set your things down. Thank you, Suzy. HUGE BLOW TO NARCOS IN MEXICO DEA AGENT ENRIQUE CAMARENA KEY PLAYER Rafa! Shit, Rafa, what the fuck are you doing! Put it down, brother! - Bro, calm down. Calm down, man. - Give me coke! Give me coke! You made me promise. You said you'd kill my family if I gave it to you. I promise if you don't give me some, I will kill them. - Don't be stupid. Calm down, man. - I promise. Give me coke! Calm down. Come on, bro. Calm down. Give me two of your pills. Two of them! They're for the boss. Hey, Rafa. Drink this. Drink it. Drink it, it's going to help you. - Are you trying to poison me? - Don't talk nonsense, brother! - You're trying to poison me. - How could you think that? Stop talking this bullshit, Rafa! Stop! You're on their side, aren't you? You told those sons of bitches about my field! You told them where the field was. Fuck, Rafa! Fuck! Fuck, bro! Relax, man. Relax, Rafa. Fuck! Drink this. Come on, Rafa. Drink it. And he's the one who took these pictures. I brought them to him and he verified to me that they were over a year old. We had to get into Félix's office... Desert's beautiful here. Yeah. So tell me, how'd you end up hiring this dumb bastard? Paid for his sister's eye surgery so she could see again. For every bad thing I do, I do some good ones as well. Buying your way into heaven, right? No. I'm not like you all. Sinaloan monkeys. I love people more than money. I also prefer people. I thought your boss was different. But he's like Huitzilopochtli. Aztec god who took power by killing his brothers. Tore their hearts out. And threw them down the mountain. Hey! Do you know if he's coming? I don't know who you're referring to. Cuco! Cuco! I'm feeling better now! Thank you! Rafa. Rafa! Rafa. Rafa! Are you all right? Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay? Hey. Where did she go, Cuco? Who left? Calm down, calm down. Where is she? Make it stop, Cuco. We have quite a few files to go through, so it is gonna take some time. I will let you know what the committee decides. Thank you both so much for your time. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - We'll be in touch. All right. Safe travels now. This is not how we agreed to do business. You talk to my nephew. Excuse me. But this has to be in person. There's no other way. Here we are. Say what you have to say. The money we've made up to this point is nothing compared to what we'll be making once everything is running like I want it to. Hundreds of millions of dollars. Why jeopardize that for what some American agent might know? They call you The Godfather. And you're afraid to get your hands dirty, Félix? Not even close. But I am afraid of panic. Turns out it's bad for business. And what happened to El Azul's predecessor... that was good for business? Management turnover. That's all. The fucking DEA has nothing else. They're already transferring these agents out of Mexico. We have to let this thing die down. Quietly. We won't touch the American. So where's my fucking truck? It's on the other side of that ridge, Don Pablo. Yes. So's the US border, Paco. You know I'm not a snitch. I'd never do that to you. And if it's a setup and the Americans are waiting for us? Or our watermelon truck. I've seen how it ends for me. I die in a big shoot-out. Men with badges, heavy guns. If this is it... fuck it. Come on. Let's go down. Don't think about it, get out. Hey! Are we going to get our fucking coke or what? Pull from there. There it is. Pull! Look. Look, Dopey. We found Snow White. So I read the brochure on the Catholic school. And what's wrong with public school? I'm just worried it might be a step down from the American school here. So now that we live in a big house and Kikito goes to private school, we're all fancy now? Yeah, we're the MexicanJeffersons now. Los Jeffersons. - Sí. - Ha. How'd it go today? I thought you didn't care and just wanted to go home. I didn't say that. Plus, I know you can't wait to brag. Oh. Well, I wish you would've seen it. They were eating out of my hand. Both hands. When do you think you'll hear? Hopefully before we leave. Remember when you got word that you weren't getting that job in Miami? I was so pissed. If I told you then you could go to San Diego with a bump in grade and salary... I'd be happy. Can you heat one up for me, please? Whatever happens with this, Kiki, you did enough. For us... you did enough. - Let's see. - No, you can't with that one. Too big. It's too big. You do magic or not? How are you doing, Sammy? - You want to talk to him? - No. To you. It's modeled after the church in Culiacán. With all due respect, sir, I think it's going to be the most beautiful mausoleum in Sinaloa. I want him to be comfortable. We can add air conditioning, a sound system to play his music, a fridge stocked with his favorite beverages... It's the "King Tut" package. And you think his sports car will fit? Yes, of course. If not, we can always adjust for it. Listen. Don Neto, excuse me. I'll be driving you to dinner tonight. Whenever you like. Where's Sammy? Had to run an errand. Asshole, I didn't send him. No, it was for Azul. - Excuse me. - Hold on. Where'd they go? - I don't know, boss. - What do you mean you don't know? Let me find out. Rafa. Rafa! They're looking for you. What's up, Rafa? What the fuck you want? Same thing as you. Years of junk, huh? Yeah, lots of it. Got a lunch receipt from 1983. You think I can still get reimbursed? Hey, you know the Camelot opens at 11:00? Yep. So what did the investigator say? Hmm. Well, that's why I wanted to have drinks. Mm-hmm. Spoke with them this morning. "No further action at this time." - No action. - Yeah. Committee didn't want to act before the State Department so... they're not doing a thing. More bullshit. At this point, I can't really say that I'm, uh... surprised... or disappointed. But you still are. Yeah. Me too. So what are you going to do now, Kiki? I'm going to have lunch with my lady. But I've got feelings. You planted a flower. - Very well. - That flower gave you its petals... What's up, Neto? Let me see if Rafa is available. Hello? Félix! - What's up? - Hey! It turns out Pablo Acosta's a fucking genius, bro. Thought he was a crazy bloody asshole. That too, but we went to recover a load, and I saw how that motherfucker hides the coke in the trucks. Gas tanks. We could learn something from this guy. Good afternoon. - Don Neto here. Let me talk to the boss. - He's busy. Interrupt him! It's very important. You have 30 seconds, woman. We can bury them in the runways to hide the coke. - Uh-huh. - Sir... Hold one second, Amado. What's going on? Excuse me, Señor Neto's on the other line. We'll call him back in a minute. He says it's very important. This one is also important. I'll call him back. Go on, Amado. What the fuck is happening, Rafa? Nothing. Fucking shit no one can stop. Agent Camarena. Hi, Sammy. My commander wants to see you. - Hello. Table for two? - Yes, follow me, please. Here's the menu. - Thank you. - You're welcome. All right, move ahead. Talk later. What is it, Neto? The kid fucked up. They're taking Camarena. Okay, I'm on my way. DEA. - Hey, Suzy, it's Mika. - Hi, Mika. Um, have you seen Kiki? No, I haven't seen him for a few hours actually. Oh, um, he... he didn't show up for lunch. Well, he and Jaime stepped out for a drink before. It's probably more than one. Do you want me to have him give you a call when he gets in, sweetie? No, that's okay. Thanks, Suzy. - Bye. - Bye. You agreed to this? That son of a bitch has to pay for what he did. Come here. Come here! Forget about your goddamn field, Rafa. You know why they asked you? Because if something goes wrong, they will blame you. Bullshit. They asked me because you did nothing about the fuckers in the DEA. Look at me, asshole. Look at me! Is that what El Azul told you? They're using you, Rafa. You think I'm too dumb to think for myself? This is my business as much as yours, Félix. So fuck you. I made the call and there's nothing you can do about it. Okay. Azul! We're going to take the agent back. Take him back where you found him. And leave him alone. Am I clear? That's not your call, Félix. I thought you weren't going to touch the American. - I changed my mind. - Oh, really? Without consulting me? You seem to think we're partners. I think I make you a lot of money. And now your ignorance is jeopardizing that. Listen carefully, Félix. You seem to have trouble doing that. Two days ago, the DEA agent spoke to two members of an investigation team from the United States Congress. Do you know what they talked about? Do you have any idea what the Americans might be doing? I didn't think so. We have to find out exactly what he knows. Of course, you're welcome to let him go. But if you do, I'm not sure you can continue having our support. Where is he? Félix! We can find another desert. Plant Caro's weed again. Start over. Start over, Neto? - We're almost there. - Almost where? Getting where? Handcuffed to these serpents? You're the smartest guy I know, Félix. But this... Begin.
