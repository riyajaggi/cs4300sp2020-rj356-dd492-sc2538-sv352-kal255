 I won't let you sit here if you do that. - Mom, you're in trouble. - Hush up. Turn off the car. - Of course. - Turn off the fucking car! Sorry, did I do something wrong? Get out. I don't understand. - Get out! - Did I run... You're hurting me! What are you doing? Tell me what I did!

 Tell me! - My husband works... - Exactly, lady. Your husband. No. No! Kiki! No! Kiki! Calm down. What is he doing? Kikito! Open the door! Let me out of here! Let me out! You know it's not a good idea to leave your children under the sun in a hot car, right? Very bad, Mrs. Mika Camarena. Kiki. Kiki.

 Kiki. What'd he say? He said if I liked Guadalajara and I said yes. He seemed pretty nice. If you're a criminal and you have the one group that's supposed to be dedicated to stopping you on your side... shit. You can run the table. The cartel had the biggest gang in Mexico in their pocket. A private army basically doing their bidding. These guys brought new meaning to the term "serve and protect." Harassing, intimidating, keeping the DEA out of the way so that Félix Gallardo could focus on other things, like expanding. I have heard from Isabella about the organization you built. You've done well. But now she tells me you want to change things. More like taking advantage of certain opportunities, no? The Americans have closed almost all the Caribbean routes. You have a mountain of product just sitting there with nowhere to go. Félix can swing the door open to 3,000 kilometers of the border. And here you are, Mr. Mexico. Look, we ship marijuana across the border every day. Day and night. Seven days a week, we never stop. It's just a matter of changing what's in the trucks. Cocaine. And you have the political juice to pull that off? Yeah. Don't worry about that. I will take care of it myself, personally. This isn't like selling bananas one day and pineapples the next. It's a whole other business. If I give you my support... I have to be sure that you understand what you're getting into. Speaking clearly... once you handle Colombian powder, you're responsible for it. Lose the product... brother... there will be consequences. Very serious consequences. That's understood. There are two organizations down there that really matter. One's shrewd. Businessmen. The other, he has very big emotions. Tell me about the good businessmen. Dealing with them requires a lot of discretion. Because someone will be jealous? Like I said... big emotions. I'd be a fool not to go with the shrewd ones. I will make the call then. I'll let you know when they want to meet. Miguel Ángel, if I were you... I would take her with me. Colombians love a round ass. Just by looking at her, those poor fools won't even be able to talk. You have a good thing going here, Mr. Félix. Then why change it? Like I said... there's an opportunity, no? Thank you for everything. Sir. You know something, maybe this guy's right. Why don't you come with me? Whatever you need, Miguel. Used to leave our doors unlocked. City feels different. It does. Did you say he knew your name? Yeah. He didn't look at my license or papers. Locked me in the car while he talked to Kiki Jr. Fucking asshole. I went to high school with guys in Calexico that were scarier than him. He put his hands on you? Yeah. You tell Kiki that? No way. I filed a report with Mendez in person and copied the embassy on it. So we're filing police reports on the fucking police? How's that work exactly? It's one thing if they're tailing us every time we leave our office, but this other shit? Come on. What did the embassy say? - Still waiting on a response. - How's this for a response? Someone tries to scare my wife again, I'm gonna find them and I'm gonna shoot 'em in the head. - Kiki. - I mean it. You want to hurt these guys, we gotta take down the ones calling the shots. The traffickers? You send the same memo every Monday to Mexico City. No help. Heath doesn't even read that bullshit. Yeah, I'm not talking about Mexico City. Fuck them. I'm talking about going over their head, straight to D.C. - You'd do that? - I would. What's D.C. really care about? Because it ain't seizure numbers or drug arrests, right? Money. We know Félix is pulling in huge cash. Now we put a number on it, we make Miguel Félix Gallardo famous up north. Rog, tell them what you just told me about Spain. DEA Madrid's up on some dealer from Cádiz for about six months. Now, one of the numbers he calls the most is here in Guadalajara. Hotel Americas. So Spanish cops put in a diplomatic request for a tap on this end. Now since it's from Spain, doesn't ring any alarm bells, gets approved. This gives us a back door warrant to tap Félix's entire operation. That gets D.C. to wake up, force the Mexicans to act. That's how this gets done. Heath's gonna be pissed. Well, he can send me a fucking memo. Ooh. I should've brought a jacket. - Thank you. - We're here no matter what happens. Look at this clown. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's been here all week. You good, buddy? You want one? - I think maybe you better drive. - Huh? - Hand them over, cowboy. - Get him, Butch. Don't egg him on. Could maybe go for... $4,000? I haven't been running it much. Starter might need replacing. Well... it would be something to do. What's on your mind? We both know this car isn't worth $4,000. I need help... setting up a wire tap. All above-board. Legal. - Who would listen to the calls? - Just us. I need it fed straight to my office. I'll pay you. I have a nephew. Drives a truck for the city. A few days ago, some assholes ran a red light. He yelled at them to watch it. They forced him off the road... showed him a badge and beat him with a gun. Told him they'd kill him the next time he opened his mouth. Keep your money. You can count on me. You're a good man. I'll give you a thousand. Fuck you, I'm not giving it away! This was the song playing... the third time me and Sofia fucked. God damn it. There, Rafa, don't worry. You need to move on. How do you move on from a woman like that? With time. Drinking. Cheers. What the hell? We didn't cut the cake yet. I paid someone off. Listen... there's something you should know. What's up? Rafa and Amado. Rafa has his way of packing seedless. Vacuum sealed bricks or some shit. But Amado has been repacking it in potato sacks to save space. So Rafa took offense. There was a scuffle and... a gun was drawn. - Fucking children. - No doubt. That's why I gave the word to have them both killed. Good, keep me up to date. There you are. Trying to hide out? No, just taking a break. Did you see Miguelito? He's having a blast. All the kids, they're having fun. How about you? You seem distracted. You've been quiet all day. All week. Lots of work, been tired. That's it, very tired. I'm going to Colombia. When are you going? I leave tomorrow. You never told me about this shit. I know, that's why I'm telling you now. Are you crazy? - Cocaine, Miguel? - Hey, keep it down. But... you've been so careful in building everything we have. Why do you want to do this now? If I don't, someone else will. - We're doing the presents! - Come on. Come on, honey. Hold on, son, no, no. The one from your mother first. I think it's the bottom one. There's a story about a group of blind men who come across an elephant. I'm not sure why, but that's not the point. One of the blind men touches its trunk, another pats its side, another guy grabs the tail. And they all think that's what an elephant is. Because they're too close, they can't get the whole picture. The DEA had been on Félix for months, but turns out they were just blind guys feeling up an elephant. Perspective changes everything. I think that's the point. Well, that and a good wire tap. Their phone guy didn't just grab a single line. The crafty bastard did the entire exchange. Every number that passed through the Hotel Americas. And the second the wire tap went up, they started to truly understand the Guadalajara cartel. For the first time, they started to see the whole fucking elephant. All of the fifth floor. Purchasing. A full-time secretary to handle DFS bribes. Scores of accountants. Transpo. All working toward a single goal: the outflow of weed, the inflow of cash. And overseeing it all from right there in sunny Guadalajara, our man Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo. They called it Operation Padrino. And what they discovered was staggering. The sheer size. Payroll for field workers, drivers, cops, enforcers. Nearly a hundred code names for politicians, small and large. Then, payments for farm equipment, fuel, real estate, even fucking strawberry soda. But the most interesting news was where he parked his cash. Hey, Chief! You know that Texas number that keeps popping up on the fifth floor? El Paso Savings and Trust. Son of a bitch. - Good old American dollars, boys. - Makes sense. We don't even cash our paychecks here because the banks are so fucking sketchy. - Stay on it. - Will do. - Can I see that? - Yeah. What's on the fifth floor? The Wizard of Oz. No. Just reading about that asshole. You think he lies in bed at night reading about you? If he knows what's good for him. He probably doesn't even know my name. He will. One day. Fucking A. Um, Kikito has that choir thing tomorrow. - Yeah, at 4:30. - Mm-hmm. You okay? The girls and I are gonna start carpooling together. Help each other shopping, you know, help each other with the kids. - Yeah, that's good. - Yeah. - Strength by numbers, you know? - Yeah, just for a week or two. So this Wizard of Oz... you gonna bust his ass? Mm-hmm. Getting closer every day. Good. You're gonna want to check this out. Sir! I was looking through the transcripts this... last night. Just cue it up here. He's saying he's got to buy new trucks for the upcoming harvest. Our guy's not home? Uh-uh. But his checkbook is. Sitting right there in his office. How do we get our hands on it? I can do it. Well, let's talk about how that might happen. Well, you're probably an expert on Colombian cocaine by now. But in the early '80s, it was only just making a name for itself. And even in those early days, it was already a tale of two cities. Number one in the game was the Medellín cartel, making a lot of noise. But coming up quickly was a more discreet organization. They called themselves the Gentlemen of Cali. Everybody else called them the Cali cartel. Escobar dominates what's left of the Caribbean routes. Fine. Let him have it. Matta made this introduction so that I can offer you something new. Something safer and permanent. Right now, we move weed easily to any border city in the US. Not sure if you guys are familiar with the Sonora-Tijuana corridor. It's all ours. We bring in tons through there. By land or sea, either way, I can bring it in. Now picture this: Your cocaine... and my distribution. We will bring in more powder than through the Bahamas. Fucking American agents in Florida, they'll be dumbfounded and won't even know where it's coming from. Yes, we know about your reputation. What you've accomplished. But this hand-off system of yours... marijuana is one thing, coke is another, no? I don't really agree with that. A market of $4 billion versus whatever that shit makes. What my partner means is that... when things become more valuable... trust comes at a higher price, no? Yes, everything has a price, and it must be paid, right? Music to my ears. Because it will be paid by you. What the...? Sorry? The payoffs, middlemen... all of that comes out of your end. You'll have to excuse us, our friend here is slow to warm up to new people. It's okay, I agree. We'll pay. Sicilia Falcón still runs Tijuana. He has a lot of well-connected friends there. In Mexico and the United States. I have friends too. A lot. Well, that's good. But we know him... and not you, so what do we do? Where does he fit in all of this? Out of everyone here, the one that knows him best is my associate, right? Tell them. It's very simple. Falcón can't move the kind of weight you require. I've known him for several years. He's well liked in Tijuana, but... but Falcón doesn't have what Félix has. So you have to ask yourself, do you want to move your coke through a straw or a pipeline? In only a matter of months, Medellín will look tiny compared to you. Let's see... Do me a favor and imagine how comfortable you and your brother's life will be... when we start to move these amounts? Come on. You will be walking in the clouds. I didn't come here to waste your time. Go ahead and close the fucking deal, I want to take her dancing. Before Pachito here breaks more hearts. Let's talk numbers. It's a dream of mine, man. My own business. You should invest. Get in on the ground floor. What do you have to lose? What do you know about running a restaurant, Cochi? Well, shit. What's there to know? Just have to do it. Try it. What the fuck? - What kind of food you gonna have? - Seafood, man. Sinaloan style. Gonna call it "The Crazy Lobster." Sounds good. Hey, ladies, get to work. - Let's go. - Hey, Chapito. How's virginity treating you? I pulled 3 women last night, what the fuck. - Three women? - Cochiloco here is opening a restaurant. - Yeah, The Crazy Lobster. - What kind? Sinaloan seafood, man. Oh, spicy ceviche. - That's right. - Benjamín! Move it! Raise the door! Quickly! Quick! You know who I am? Who my family is? Mr. Falcón. What the fuck? Indeed, Benjamín. Take all of that. Okay, assholes, take it out. Assurances were given to me by your associate in Guadalajara. Promises were made, which are now being broken. So you ask... "What the fuck?" - Look, you don't want to... - Not a word, fuckers! Starting today, no one, no one, moves a dime of weed through my plaza. No one! Not even you. Tell your brothers. That's enough, guys. Hurry. Do that thing with the thing. Hey! Rafa, it's him. You think you can fuck with my business? Ah. Rafa, you got my message? Message, my ass. You stole my dope, fucker! Félix is moving on my entire business. How else would I react? What? Your boss didn't tell you? He's my partner, asshole, get it straight. If you say so. I heard Félix flew to Cali this morning to fuck me over. You as well, it sounds like. Listen, don't you understand that cocaine makes ten times the profit of marijuana? Félix moving into coke makes your sinsemilla useless. Come on, partner. Maybe you and I should work together. Maybe you should shut your mouth, and maybe I should go get my fucking dope and gut you... You fucking piece of shit peasant! What's wrong with you? - What did Amado do now? - Did Félix go to Colombia? If he gets involved with coke, where does that leave us? Calm down, who said this? Falcón? Don't listen to that cocksucker. Have a fucking beer. I'll look into it. When we land, call Matta so he knows it went well. I'm sure he already knows. What the hell? - Easy, I'm Miguel... - Don't touch me! What the fuck? What the fuck? Calm down! - Calm down! - Okay. You okay? Get comfortable, it's a long drive. Who are you? Boss wants to talk. Where are we going? To Medellín. Nice sunglasses there. Try them on, see how they look. - Hello. - Maria, look at you, beautiful as ever. Miguel's not here. He didn't say when he'd be back. Days, maybe. Okay. If he calls, tell him we need to talk. Hope you're well. Wait. Sit with me a minute? So, Colombia. Rafa mentioned something, but I wasn't sure it was true. Lately you spend more time with him than I do. Why is he doing this? Sometimes I feel like I don't know him at all. Félix is not a simple man, Maria. We have trafficking in our blood. Your father knew the game as well as anyone. I remember being in the fields with my father. He would do it so we could eat. But look now, Neto. Our children don't go hungry. So what did he say? "If I don't do it, someone else will." And he will. That guy is no fool. Okay. When he gets back, ask him to call me. You'll see him before I do. Take off your hat. Oh, yeah. I mean, he's shorter than you. - But he is better looking. - Yeah. I don't know. Pretty close. - Jaime? - God damn it. Anything feels off, you pull the plug. All right? Got some civilian clothes, son? - Yes, sir. - All right. Go get them. Those guys are out. All right, let's go. You're good. Thanks, Suzy. Yeah, right over there. Right here. Perfect. Well, thanks for doing this, Suzy. Be safe. I will be. Thank you. You guys go up. I'm getting a drink at the bar, I'll wait there. Do I know you? Emilio Gómez Estrada. I work in agriculture. You too? No. Good day. Okay, kids, we have arrived. Let's go. Get out quickly, go! Move it, sweetie! Hey, what's up, Poison? - How are you, Blackie? - Look what I brought you. Okay, let's do this. You come with me. And you stay here. Come with me now. Agh! Um... I need to... go in. Bathroom... water... floor... Ah. What's this? Geez. Wait here. Okay. Hippos. You ever seen one before? No. I haven't had the pleasure in person. They look sweet. Like a baby, fat and bald. But they're temperamental. Get between it and something it cares about, it will bite you in half. Follow me. Look, brother... I've always believed that the truth is best. With friends, enemies, it doesn't matter, I always speak the truth. I expect the same from you. So I will only ask once... Why are you in Colombia? I had a meeting with the Cali organization. We made a deal... to move their product through Mexico. Hmm. You made a deal with Cali? Yes. Why them? I was told you were temperamental. That's right. The thing is... that represents a threat to me, right? Yeah. I agree. If we're being honest, this will put you out of business. I could feed you to the hippos. I don't like Mexicans. If we're being honest. If you wanted to kill me, your men would have shot me on the road. Hmm. Marijuana is a soft product. It doesn't hurt anyone. For now, it's illegal, but in the long run, it will be legalized. But cocaine is another story. It scares the Americans. They believe it's destroying them. Moving coke will bring you fame that you can't hide from. It will make you a target. Yeah, I already know. So then, why do it? - If I don't do it, someone else will. - Don't come at me with that bullshit. Why do you want to do it? When I was 22, I was in love. My first wife... she died of leukemia. We have to control this fucking world. Or it will control you. And if you don't protect yourself, it makes a mess and breaks you. You are going to take one of our loads... for every load of theirs. Half Cali, half us. And if something gets lost on the way, brother... it better be Cali's half. This will arrive next week. Are you ready for this? We're ready. It's settled then. Hey... would you have really fed me to those hippos? No. Hippos... don't like Mexicans either. So what? Do you want a drink or what? Good. And the payments from Tijuana? You said Juárez. You are fucking idiots. God fucking damn it. PERSONAL ACCOUNTS MR. FELIX GALLARDO Let's go to Cartagena, no? Huh? I want to see the ocean at night. I didn't bring anything to swim with. Me neither. Come on, let's go. You and me. Right now. Hey. I brought you here for your contacts. And because you are strong. I want your advice, Isabella. You were great today. I can use you with my business. I'm not working for free. Nobody said that. Think about what you want. You need a new deal, Miguel. It's one thing paying the police to move Mexican dope all over the border, but it's something else to turn Mexico into a runway for Colombian coke. If you haven't secured a deal with the government - before Escobar's coke arrives... - Yeah, I know, this whole show crumbles. I'm working on it. Let's go. Treasury says they're moving upwards of 30 million through these accounts every week. That's good, right? Look out, you slick-haired motherfucker. I had a meeting with the guys from Cali, then with Escobar. Then it's true? Yeah. They're impressed with what we've built. The money from cocaine will change everything. We made a good deal that makes us stronger. - Félix, don't be stupid. - Rafa, Rafa, Rafa... What?! What we have here is stable. It's working. We have control. And you just give it all away? These hands... grow the best weed in the world. The best weed in the fucking world. But we don't know shit about cocaine. Really? From what I've heard, you're learning about it pretty quickly. What's up, brother? Why? That's all I want to know. What's up? You're not going to stop it. The coke is coming to Mexico, like it or not. No, we can stop it because we are in charge. This is our shit! And the Colombians... we don't want to work for them and be their delivery boys... Mexico will be the only way left for cocaine to come into the United States. There's the market. That's our future. You want to be left out? I'm sorry, brother... but I'm against it. That's fine. We're moving forward with this. I'm with Miguel Ángel on this. That shit is the devil. You understand where he's coming from? Yes. He cares more about some fucking plants than real business. He's an artist. A pain in the ass. This is a gamble. You know that. Yeah, well, to be the richest man in Mexico, you have to risk a little. Okay. I'll take Rafa back to Tijuana to get his weed back. Put his head right. I don't give a shit about the load. It's not right. Falcón chasing us out of Tijuana looks bad, especially with what you've got going on. It's the wrong time to lose the plaza. That's fine. Go on ahead. You're right. Miguelito. Yeah. Better make sure things work out. I'll take care of it. Jaime, it's D.C. Administrator Mullen on the phone. Thank you, Suzy. Sir, how are you? Jaime, it's been awhile. Sounds like you've been busy down there. You don't know how true that is. Did you read the Félix Gallardo report? I did. It's a hell of a read. Very impressive work. Well, thank you, sir. Made a lot of noise around here, if you want to know the truth. I suppose that was the plan. Look, uh... your team's dealing with a tough situation. And I know that, believe me. You've been given a job to do and no tools to do it with. But our mission doesn't always get priority. Damn near never, in fact. Forcing a confrontation on corruption isn't a play the State Department or the folks up here are comfortable with right now. - Sir? - There are other factors involved. Or so I'm told. Other factors? Yeah, debt payment for one. Wall Street pumped a shit ton of money into PEMEX before the whole oil thing went belly-up. All due respect, sir, I'm more concerned about my three men and their exposure... Look, sir... what's happening down here, it's serious. Someone has got to start paying attention. He's on the phone with D.C. Yes, sir. No, yeah, I... I do understand that. I do. Sorry, Jaime. Sir. Is this something that will make me happy? I doubt it, sir. It's from the desk of the Attorney General's office. It's what the Americans have been doing in Guadalajara. What the fuck? Okay, how big you want it, kiddo? Big as a pan. Big as a pan. Your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Do I know you? Heard of this name? No. These are the best I've ever made. Look how perfect they are. Billy, help your sister. No, wait! What are you doing... I swear to God, if you don't take those out... Get down! Get down! Come here! Sweetie, get down! Get down! Okay, stay here. Don't move. Be quiet. Be quiet. Be... Right there. Right there. I got it. I got it. Okay. Shh, shh. We talked to his wife. Kiki. It ain't your fault. It's our fault. Our people gave him up. I told him we wouldn't, but, uh... but we did. What about Knapp? Moved to a safehouse. Rita and the kids are pretty shook up. They're sending him home. Our guy takes a fucking shot, and he gets sent packing. It's the embassy's call. Regulations. You know the drill. Yeah, but they're not sending a replacement. That's not the drill. What the fuck are we doing here? We're way out in front and nobody's behind us. Yeah? We gave 'em everything. Account numbers, balances, the whole thing. They don't give a shit. We use that report a different way. Those accounts in Texas, Félix holds them under a fake name. That right there is what? It's bank fraud, wire fraud... Shit, racketeering? We get him up there. 'Cause fuck here. Fuck Mexico. We lure him across the border. Arrest him in America. Cuff that motherfucker ourselves. Okay. You got any ideas how we do that? Subtitle translation by
