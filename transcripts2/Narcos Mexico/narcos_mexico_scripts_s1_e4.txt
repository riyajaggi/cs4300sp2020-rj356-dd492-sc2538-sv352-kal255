 I like to go out jogging. Try and mix in weights when I can. You? Do I... exercise? Mm-hmm. Uh... Oh, Rafa! Yeah! It's all been cardio, I suppose. Me too. On the floor, motherfuckers!

 - On the floor! Are you deaf? - Head down! Get down! You have no idea who you're fucking with. Do you know who I am? An old man who can't sing for shit. Get on the ground, motherfucker! Let the ruling class tremble! Long live... the prole... - The prole... - Long live the Revolution! Ah! Ah! - Stand up. - No. No! No! - Shut up or I'll kill you! - Sofia! No! - No, please don't take her. - Dad! - Mom! - Don't take her! Please!

 Sofia! Please don't take her! Don't take her! Sofia! - Don't take her! Please! Sofía! - Sofia! No! Open, asshole! - Sofia! - Dad! Sofia! It's "proletariat," stupid. And you were supposed to kick over the Christmas tree. - Okay, but we didn't do that bad. - No, Rafa, you were wonderful. It's so romantic! Have you ever met a guy like this? Has everything under control, not a single hair out of place? That was Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo. "The Thin Man." Drug kingpin of Guadalajara. DEA wanted to know everything about him, right down to what side of the fucking bed he got up on. But this guy had everything locked down. Anytime they got close, his DFS friends were there waiting. Watch out! Goddamn it! Shit! Fucking with him every step of the way. - Goddamn it. - Both. This one too? - Yeah, fucking knives. - They took what they could get. Hold on. That's Rafa right there. They couldn't get near the big fish. So they targeted the small ones. Not until later, darling. Not until later. They worked him... and gradually started getting a better picture of the empire he'd built. Here's what they did know. Félix had partnered with the DFS and plaza bosses. And using his massive supply of marijuana, he was able to control the market and fix the price of weed across North America. Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo had singlehandedly built a confederation of drug traffickers. The first Mexican drug cartel. But that's a lot to get your head around. Especially when drinking the water in Mexico City. The Rockefeller of marijuana. Pretty much. Why not just hit this field and cut off his supply? We can't get back to it, sir. Félix covers his tracks. The eradication program should be able to find it. Yeah, they think Félix has gotten to that, too. We feel our best bet is to go straight at Félix, sir, cut the head off the snake. Of course, it's a challenge when the men who are supposed to be our partners are working against us. We need some real support from Mexico City, sir. Enough pressure from you... we just might get it. What do you think, Heath? I think the Mexican drug business is as organized as my wife's checkbook. The fact is, drug violence is down, seizures are up. - That's because the business is organized. - How's that? Well, the more money you have, the more cops you can own, the more you can inflate the numbers. It's a joke. All right. Sir, numbers aside, there is a real opportunity here. We take out Félix, we cripple the Mexican drug trade. Numbers matter, Jaime. And if this is what a cartel looks like, I can live with that. So how do you take down a crook who's at the top of his game? Who has every cop in town in his pocket? Well... you hold your breath and you hope you get lucky. We need to talk. They're coming for Rafa. Open, asshole! Sofia! Remember this guy? Well, turns out he's the Minister of Education and a senior member of the most powerful political party in Mexico. For 50 years, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, controlled the presidency of Mexico and never lost a senate seat. Wonder how they managed that. Félix knew if he didn't give them what they wanted, they'd rip his business down to the studs and he'd back to scraping pennies together in Sinaloa. Rafa fucked up. He screwed with the order of things. These assholes sit above us all. I'm taking you to the hotel. You and the kids. You'll be safer there. And Rafa? Are you gonna answer me? Wha... What!? What do you want me to tell you? I have a business to protect. I stand in their way, and they'll make us disappear. The narco who thinks he's a businessman... is a narco about to get fucked. No doubt something your father said. He was a man of few words. So what? Those days are over! This isn't the ranch anymore. We can't just grab our shit and... head for the hills and vanish. Then remember why we left there. You can't trust those motherfuckers. You can't turn Rafa in, Miguel. I don't know. You can take care of your business, Miguel. But also protect your family. Look at this guy. I'll get it. I'll take him. Hi. Hey. Hi, my little dancer. - Oh. - Hey. Well, it happened. Thin Man fucked up. The hell was this guy thinking? All that matters is Rafa has crossed hombres that you do not cross. He's about to get caught in a PRI shitstorm. Best way to catch the smart ones? Get an idiot working for 'em. So Rafa rolls, gives us Félix. Just gotta get it done before the PRI genie goes back in the bottle. Or Rafa gets the fuck out of Dodge. Shit! No! Bonnie! Now, you sons of bitches, this is a fucking stickup. You don't wanna give us the money? Then eat lead, motherfuckers! We should rob a bank. They're mine. All the more reason. You make a good Bonnie. Why do you always get to be the badass? Because Bonnie was the heart, and Clyde the brains. And Clyde was always on top. And I'm the badass. Rafa. Rafa! - What the fuck do you want? - Félix is outside. You realize what you've done? All right, man. There's no problem. No problem? None? It was just a joke. The family wants you dead, Rafa. And they're in the PRI. I'll bring her home tomorrow, and it'll blow over. You're turning yourself in. No fucking way. Why? They're sending men from Mexico City to put a bullet in your head, Rafa. They're going to tear the business apart looking for you. Everything I've built. Oh, so you invented sinsemilla now? You don't fucking get it, Rafa. We finally got all we wanted. And you're thinking with your dick? I turn myself in, then what? It's just this girl... Damn! I thought that... nothing would ever get me away from that field. But it's okay. I'm going to turn myself in. Take me in, man. But it can't be like last time. And no fucking way I'm writing you from prison, asshole. Go say goodbye. And pack a bag. You're not turning me in? Now! Before I change my mind. This motherfucker. Contrary to what you may have heard, when the Mexican government puts its mind to something, it gets it done. Remember the Alamo? When they come, they come hard. And by the way they responded to this, it was looking like Félix's problem was DEA's opportunity. Within 24 hours of Rafa waving a gun in a minister's face, they put up roadblocks everywhere, and sent their big game hunter from Mexico City. This was the man the locals called the Eliot Ness of Mexico. Subcomandante Guillermo González Calderoni. Rafael Caro Quintero. Our target. Business associate of many of the Sinaloans who've relocated to this area. Gentlemen... let me make this clear. Caro's going down. This comes from the top. We've got a perimeter around the city. Your captains have their orders. Now get off your asses and get to work. Commander, we're from the DEA in Guadalajara. We're here to offer our assistance. Don't sweat it. I speak real good English. We have information on Rafa. My local offices are familiar with Mr. Caro Quintero. All due respect, Comandante, the only contact your men have with him is pretending to seize his weed. Which will not be helpful with Mexico City breathing down your neck for him. Sir, we've been following him for a while. Him, his associates, his residences. Even the big ugly four-by-four that he rolls around town in. Get your gear. We leave in 20. Let's go. - Mr. Félix. - I don't have time right now. Who is after... how is it? Doña Blanca. Very good! I'm that little bee that's after... This girl is very smart. Daddy's home. The one person I don't see... is Rafa. Yeah. We couldn't find him. It's your funeral. Abril, let your father speak with the man. Come. Let's go find your brother. Must be playing around. Bye, precious. Bye. Cute family. So, how do we fix this? - "We"? - Yes, this is also your mess. Besides, I pay you. Yes, but... we all answer to someone. At least I... I know who I answer to. You know what? Tell your boss I'll do him that favor. I'll arrange the planes, coordinate everything. I thought favors were beneath you? Well, tell him to accept it as a friendly gesture. To call off the search. He's Secretary of Defense. I don't tell him shit. Okay, but... he listens to you. You can make a recommendation. Yes, but running an errand with one of your planes, and kidnapped daughters? Well... they're not worth the same. Let's do something, okay? I'll make the call. But you'll oversee the mission yourself. - Why? - Think of it as... quality control. - That wasn't the deal. - Yes, but circumstances have changed. And they leave Rafa alone? Who knows? But they'll kill him if you don't. That I'll guarantee. I'd get moving if I were you. Thanks for the drink. Those warrants came through fast. I guess everybody wants justice now, huh? What, are you some fucking pocho cop can't believe how shit works here? I thought I knew... until I got down here and saw how fucked up it is. And don't call me pocho. Hmm. Things are more complicated than you think. But if you know how to play it, you can still do good work. That sounds like a bunch of excuses. Do you know why we call a bribe "una mordida," Agent Camarena? Because they want to take a bite? Because everybody's got to eat. Salazar. Take the back. Carrillo, from this side. Make a fucking mess. Now! Doesn't hurt to send a message. Yeah, subtle. We hit every fucking address you gave us, Agent Camarena. All of Rafa's houses. Nothing. We've got fuck all. You better hope he's still in the city. I have a CI. Javier Contreras. Yeah, he hangs out with one of Rafa's gunmen. Let's go have a talk with Mr. Contreras. This shit is cool. - You flown this type of plane before? - No, but it's like girls. Doesn't matter the size, they all move the same. What's the cargo we're moving? Who knows? Well, where are we taking it? Once we get there, they'll tell us. And Nava will be waiting for our call after we deliver. Brother, if Rafa fucked up as bad as you say... have you considered this is Nava's way of taking the whole thing for himself? What the hell is this? This is called laying low, motherfucker, and you're gonna do it. Bring those. Welcome. What the fuck? Looks like a book store. Félix wanted the biggest house in town. But there's hardly any furniture. Or Christmas decorations. Look. It would've been real easy for him to toss you to the lions. - If it had been me... - What? You would've given me up? I would've killed you with my own hands. Sit down. We're not gonna call anyone. Especially the girl. We're gonna keep quiet and out of sight. Got it? And pray St. Miguelito saves you from this one. It's all yours. Fucking prick. Hey, man. Where's your commander? Shit! You the drug dealer? Huh? You ain't the enemy, man. Amen to that, right? All right, ándale, boys! Let's deliver some freedom. - What did he say? - Fast! Here. - Fuck. - Let's go! What's wrong? We're going to Nicaragua, bro. - What's up, Javi? - Hey! Let me introduce you to Jorge. He works with me at the DEA. Uh-huh. From the States? Yeah. Outside Dallas. He brought you a lot of money. Really? Ooh. It's your lucky day! Bring me another round, sweetheart. What do you want to know? Where is Rafa Caro Quintero? I don't know. Everything happened so fast... no one saw where he went. I'm not that tight with them. Look... the money's yours if you help. We'll find him one way or another. Relax, bro, calm down. Huh? Well... Get up! Get up! Give me something. Right now, motherfucker! Or I'll tear you apart. Let's see, man. Last chance, asshole. Where? Tierra Blanca! That's the neighborhood. That's all I know. I swear, it's just a rumor. - Tierra Blanca? You know where it is? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes! I need an address. Where is it? I don't know more, sir. I swear! That's all I know! I swear. It's all right. Calm down. Look at me. What was that? It's police work. That's how we do it down here. Hey, wait. I worked that kid for two months. Now I can't use him again. Well, it was worth the bullet, Agent Camarena. We still have a shot. How you do your job, that's your business. But now we have nothing. There's hundreds of houses in this neighborhood, and we're running out of time. - So we knock down some fucking doors. - And scare them off? - Or get the girl killed? - Yeah, you know what? I got an idea. Why don't I drop your ass off at the consulate? You can go back to spinning your wheels. Anyway, the girl's back home safe. Caro let her go. The parents paid the ransom? They were both in on it. Hold on. You're telling me her parents don't want her seeing some dipshit narco... so these two geniuses staged a fucking kidnapping? Lovebirds. Oh, fuck. That's how we get him. My neighbor works for the phone company. Maybe he can trace the calls going to the girl's house, and when Rafa checks in... we nail him. It could work. But my neighbor's a civilian. Okay? So you can't... slam his head on a table. Where does he live? Sofia and I were supposed to be holed up in my house. Together by the fire. Swimming in the jacuzzi. - Licking chocolate off... - For fuck's sake. You've never been in love because you don't have a heart. And it's worse during the holidays. Everyone's happier. Fuck Christmas. Give me some. Smoke your weed. Look, who knows how long we're gonna be stuck in here? If you give me some... maybe it'll cheer me up. There it is, man. Hang on. It looks rough. We deliver the cargo, make the call, and leave. Okay? I know Rafa's your boy and all that shit, but... this is pretty fucked up. What the fuck? That son of a bitch. Where the fuck did this motherfucker go? Son of a bitch. Hello? Shit! Who are these guys? There's a bunch of them. We have your delivery! It's all on the plane. - Easy, easy. - It's all good. Salvador Osuna Nava sent us. We're DFS. Ask the gringo. He knows. We need a phone. Can you get me a phone? You understand what I'm saying? We need a phone! Hey, what the fuck! - Ah! - Get it up there! Get it up! Get it! So the pain goes away. I don't want it to go. I don't want it to go, man! I want the pain inside, because I love her. I love her. This shit is very small. It doesn't fucking matter, look! Look. What the fuck! The disc doesn't skip! It doesn't skip! Doesn't skip! - Doesn't skip! - Doesn't skip! Doesn't skip! Fucking Neto! It doesn't skip! It doesn't skip! Doesn't skip! Doesn't skip! We have a problem, Neto. What happens with this? What happens with the cover? This is art! Who cares about the covers? The disc doesn't skip, man! It doesn't skip! This is the future, Neto. It's the fucking future. The future! - It's the future, Neto! - The future! It's the future, Neto! This is the future. - The future, the future! - Rafa! Rafa! Look what we brought, bro! Look, man! Where's the beer? My Christmas tree! Fuck Christmas! Where is the beer? You went to get beer, didn't you? You're just saying that 'cause you're a fucking old and bitter man who doesn't like Christmas, asshole. Gonna go get a beer. I need it to calm down. Don't listen to him, guys. The tree is beautiful. - It's cool, right? - Yeah. - Very beautiful. - Here we go. White Christmas. I'm gonna call her. No, wait, Rafa, where are you going? Rafa! Rafa, no! - Rafa, Rafa! - Chapo! You're ridiculous. Get the fuck out of my room! You're acting like a child. Well, someone won't let me act like an adult! - Bonnie? - Clyde. Bonnie. It's Christmas. No. Look! But I got to the hospital late. And I was dirty, very dirty. He was a mess, and I was like, "Kiki, she's in labor!" No, but I was nervous... Did Kiki tell you about this bad business in the city? A big narco kidnapped the daughter of a politician. Is there a way to trace the location where a phone call was made? If we knew the number that received it? Well, yes. There is a way. But it isn't legal. Which I'm sure you already know. You're cops. Of course, but we want to locate this girl before... anything bad happens to her. The narco still has her? Yes. No telling what this scumbag'll do. Imagine what her parents are going through. A fucking week before Christmas. What would you do, Antonio? Well... ...if I can help you with something... Let's go. The barricades in El Retiro and La Perla will also stay in place until further notice. Ay, ay, ay. Look at that! Oh, shit! Ay. Is everything okay, sir? Can you move? Take it easy, you won't be able to get out. I'll help you this way. There you go. Let's see. Get out. There you go. What the fuck! You've just had an accident, sir. But it's all good. Take your fucking hands off me. Okay, calm down, okay? You're talking to a state policeman. I'll fucking end you. Asshole. Let's see who you are, you bastard. Don Neto. Shit. This is the list of the calls made to the Conesa residence in the last 48 hours. So we're looking for a number with a Tierra Blanca area code to match to an address. Minister of Education's phone records without a warrant. - Now you're worried about protocol? - Not if it works. Hey. Here it is. Son of a bitch! Ruiz, set up a perimeter and check if anyone is watching. We're gonna nail this fucker, I can feel it. Christmas is coming early, Comandante! Shh, shh. Thirsty? I brought you some water. Hold his head. They can move pretty damn quick when they want to. I've got a headache, Chapo. Maybe I need another line. Yeah, I've got a headache. Who sent you? Nava. Who the fuck is Nava? Who'd you tell you were coming here? - No one. - Who are you working for? I told you. Salvador Osuna Nava. Who else knows? Who else knows what? Knows what? We're ready to move in. I want you to be focused and careful. Let's go. Don't fucking move. Shh. Shh. There's two guards, both currently facing southeast. What was that? Was that my friend? The next one's in you. A phone. Rafa. Hey. Don Neto hasn't come back. What if he got caught? I think we should get the fuck out of here. Let's go, Rafa. No, asshole. If Félix said he'd fix this... then Félix will fix it. Take his pants off. Party's over, assholes. Fun as it was. Phone! Come on! Hey. I repeat, the operation is canceled! Turn around! - What the fuck? - Okay. It's word from above. We've gotta go. It's been called off. - We have him right there. - We've got to go, okay? Come on, let's go. Camarena! Camarena. What the fuck was that? I mean, we had him! Is that what you call police work? - Kiki, settle down. - I just... Calm down! - I just want an explanation! - You're not in your country! - Fuck you. - You didn't think I want him too? I wouldn't put a bullet between that motherfucker's eyes? He was right there! - We answer to Mexico City! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - All right? - Fuck you! They're in charge. We fight them, we lose. So we take what they give us and hope it makes the pile of shit out here a little bit smaller. That's the best we can do. What are you gonna do? Huh? Hey, hey, hey. We're trying. Let's get the fuck out. Be careful! Where the fuck am I? You're home, sir. Come on, I'll get you inside. Watch out, watch out. You gonna be okay, sir? Who's really okay in this fucking world? You're right. You hit me. I should kill you. But it's Christmas. Thank you, sir. Hey! I could use a driver. I'm sorry? Be here tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. I'm sure you'll do fine. You work for me now. You all! Open there. The rest, unload. Fast! Son of a... Can you fly like that? You all right? Yes. You? Yeah. I'll get ready. Go ahead. There's a bottleneck of that shit in Honduras, Panama, El Salvador. Old Georgie Bush put the kibosh in the Bahamas. And no throughway, no coke. There goes the next season for the Mets, huh? Yeah, they're nose-hosing a ton of that shit up north, amigo. Yeah. Hmm? Big money on the trot. Now I'm speaking your language. What happened tonight? More bullshit. You want to tell me about it? Can I help? Early Christmas present? Kiki, look at me. I am. No, you're not. For the record, I tried, okay? Okay. Enjoy feeling sorry for yourself. Can you turn off the light, please? Home in one piece. What the fuck was that? Just a reminder. Of how things work. It was your idea to send me. If I remember correctly, it was yours. Just be glad it all worked out. And Félix... next time I ask you to get on your knees... your only question is "For how long?" Fucking Nava. We should kill him. Fuck what it costs us. It's not necessary, Neto. Fuck that guy. Forgive me, Miguel. Yeah. Enough, you pair of pussies. Anyone want a beer? It's 9:30 in the morning. Well, it's the best time to get started. - What happened to your eye? - Don't worry about it. Let's have a toast. For the hits life throws our way. With time, they're what make you stronger, young man. Let's go. You saved my life. I won't forget. How's it going? What a face. You look like you have a story to tell me. No. I better tell you what I saw. Kilos of cocaine. On the wrong side of the border. Just there piled up. No one moves them. Have you heard of... the South Florida Task Force? The gringos already closed the Caribbean routes. Now the Colombians will need new routes. I thought that was a small business. Something niche. It was. Not anymore. What's your friend's name? - Matta. - Yes. And your partners? Did you check with them? No. I'm just gathering information. Well, cheers for that information. Wherever it takes us. Yes.
