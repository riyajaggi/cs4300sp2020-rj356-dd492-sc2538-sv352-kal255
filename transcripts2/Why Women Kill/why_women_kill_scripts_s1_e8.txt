 Previously on Why Women Kill... Fuck! I-I know that it looks bad. You're going to rehab first thing in the morning. You are cut off. I-I-I don't think it's the best time for me right now. You don't really have a choice here. I just sold a script for $1.2 million. - You know, I think I got a lot of fucking choices. - Come on, Jade. I think maybe the best way to help him

 - is to stay here. - Fuck you both. Uh, I have an appointment. And would this appointment involve your new boyfriend Hector? He may tag along, yes. I, uh, leave for Paris two days after graduation. Care to join me? - You should go. - You'll be okay? I'll be delightful. You've got get over this obsession with another woman's husband. I'm pregnant. How do you think he'll react? - He will be thrilled. - Come clean.

 Tell him you know about the affair and the baby. What if... he doesn't choose me? Aren't you done with all the lies? - We definitely need to have a talk. - You're starting to scare me. I'm scared, too. Once I tell you, everything is going to be different. Are you sick? I'm sick. Baby, what's wrong? I have cancer. Oh, my... oh, my God. I'm going to die. I'm not sure when. I just know one day I won't be here. I'm afraid to meet God. I'll have to account for my sins. I have sinned a lot. I had an affair with a married man. I slept with another guy's wife. I had sex with a married couple and pretty much everyone else I ever met. Now I'm pregnant and unmarried. My mom has no idea I've fallen in love. Taylor doesn't know I gave Eli drugs. I'm not going to tell Rob. I'm gonna propose to Simone. I'll probably deny everything. When I do meet God, I'll just beg his forgiveness. I'll thank him for sending me the perfect woman. I'll say I did what I had to to survive. Sheila. Oh, my God. I've been on pins and needles. Did you talk to Rob last night? I did. So? I'm dying here. How did he react when you told him you knew that he was cheating on you? Well, the conversation went in a surprising direction. You said what? You said what? What? How could you say that? How could you say that, Beth Ann? What are you thinking? What are you thinking? I can't even believe you just said that! Get back here so I can give it to you! It's your mother's fault. Clearly, she forgot to teach you some of the basics. Things like, when you grow up, don't pretend to have cancer. Women lie to their husbands every day. Some lie about how much they spend. My lie's that I'm dying. Just because you act classy doesn't mean you're not fucking crazy. There is a method to my madness. Rob will never leave me while I'm sick. But what if April decides to tell him that she's having his kid? That is where her good friend Sheila comes in. I'm going to convince her to leave town. Start a new life, sever the tie for good. And then, once she's out of the picture and I have Rob all to myself, my cancer will be miraculously cured. I used to find that little grin charming. Now it just scares the shit out of me. Ladies. The doctor will see you now. Enzo. Aunt Sheila. Look at you in the white coat. This is my neighbor, Beth Ann Stanton. Beth Ann, my nephew, Enzo. The doctor. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Stanton. Likewise. So, Sheila says you studied oncology. For a little while, - and then I switched to hematology. - Oh, still, I bet you remember lots of useful tidbits. I suppose so. How can I help you? Well, I was wondering if there was a cancer you could recommend. - Recommend? - Something rare. That no one's ever heard of. It should be serious. Oh, but occasionally curable. I'm sorry... And symptoms. She's gonna need symptoms. Oh, some symptoms would be lovely. Just wait a... What exactly are we talking about here? Enzo. I say this to you as your aunt and a Sicilian: The less you know, the better. Okay. Um, rare cancers. What about... Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Say that again. I'd rather not. That's the cancer you have? It affects soft tissue. I'd give you the details, but they're disgusting and we're having fondue. God, I wish you'd let me go to the doctor's with you. You always get so emotional. No. I prefer to go with Sheila. Now, I'm going to set the table. Wait. Wait. At least tell me your prognosis. I will, but I don't want to ruin our meal. Beth Ann! Please, just tell me! Fine. But I need you to be strong. Can you do that for me, Robert? Can you be my brave boy? Yeah. Well, it seems I only have six months to live. Six months! But that doesn't mean I can't recover. Miracles happen every day. But the doctor feels we should prepare for the worst. It sounds like he's giving up already. We should get a second opinion. No. I mean, what is another doctor going to say? I don't have cancer? No, this is the situation, and we all must accept it. Okay? Okay. Now, obviously, if I'm going to fight this thing, I need you by my side. Constantly. I'm not going anywhere. You're my wife. I meant it when I said, "Till death do us part." Oh, my darling. I'm going to hold you to that. This is hard. I've never packed for a three-month trip before. Oh, packing for three months is easy. I do it every time I go away for the weekend. These look sturdy. Should I try them on? Knock yourself out. Hey, I know we agreed that you'd fly to Paris a week after me, but wouldn't three days be enough? Or even two? You can't wait one week? We need as much time for sex as possible. Remember, you said you'd make love to me in every city in Europe. What am I supposed to do on my own for a whole week? Beat it. That's cold. Oh, not you. What do you think? Do you like them? Oh, what are all the pockets for? Carrying stuff. They'll be great for hiking over the Alps. - Hiking over the Alps? - Yeah. Good Lord, are we taking a vacation or fleeing the Nazis? I'm starting to think that we're imagining very different trips. Well, I want our vacation to be elegant, romantic. Nights at la Comédie-Française, dinner at Maxim's. Yeah, well, I can't afford those things. Oh, well, if that's the problem... No, I know you can afford those things, but I-I don't want to feel like your gigolo. - I have an idea. - What? Return my brooch and get your money back. What you spent on it can buy a whole lot of escargot. I bought you this to show you what you mean to me. Well, find another way to show me. Like what? You're an artist. Use your imagination. Okay. I'll see what I can come up with. Taylor. What are you doing here? Can we talk for a sec? My mom got sick when I was ten. From that point on, it was just us, so I had to step up. But it was good, because I learned to take charge. I found out I could figure out the solution to any problem that came my way. Until last night. I sat in that hotel room until dawn trying to figure out how to fix this thing with Eli. And I just can't. I'm so sorry. You know, when Eli O.D.'d last time, I knew exactly what to do. I got him into rehab, I paid off his debts. But I think that a part of him always resented me for managing the situation in a way that he couldn't. And now he's just so angry at me. And I don't think he'll let me help him. And I'm so scared of what will happen if I can't. Eli is not going to die. He will if he doesn't stop using. But the good news is he still listens to you. So I am begging you. Please. You are my last hope. Of course, yes. Totally. I'm totally with you. I promise. Thank God. You have no idea how much that means to me. Okay. We have to move fast, before the money comes in for Eli's script. You're worried he's gonna spend it all on drugs? Not just drugs. When Eli's using, he gets stupid generous. - Stupid generous? - Oh, yeah. The last time, he bought gifts for everyone. Rolex watches, designer shoes. When he's high, he just wants everyone to be as happy as he is. So, I've been thinking of ways that we can handle this covertly. And I have one idea, but it... it's kind of crazy. I like crazy. The next time Eli's in the shower, I need you to go into his phone and find all of his passwords. What? The code to his phone is 0-4-2-9. Just here, look, I wrote it down for you. If we can get access to his his business accounts and his credit cards, we can cut off his cash flow. Oh. And I'm gonna call his dad. How will that help? Eli is terrified of his dad. Jake will force him to admit who got him using again. Why does that matter? He was clean for two years, and then suddenly he's not? No, I need to know what happened. Of course. And I want to help, but is this really - the best plan? - What do you mean? Look, you remember how you felt when you thought that Eli and I were ganging up on you. How is he gonna feel if it... if it seems like we're ganging up on him? So what do you propose we do? Give me a few days and I'll reason with him. You really think you can talk him into this? Trust me. I'll get through to him, he'll come home, and we'll all be a family again. Look who's here! - Karl, it's the Sitwells! - You're back from Scotland, I see. And we're meeting Rex and Julie for dinner. They should be here any second. Oh, I love her. She thinks I'm pretty. We all think you're pretty. But she says it out loud. Tell you what... when they get here, why don't you bring them over to our table? We'll dine together. Wonderful. Then you can tell us about your plans for Amy's lavish wedding. We're so excited. We can't wait. - Mm. - I can't wait, either. For it to be over. Yes, I was thinking the same thing. Oof, are we terrible people? No. Weddings are exhausting. Besides, we need to conserve our energy for our male lovers. At least yours isn't younger than the groom. Yeah, I think the, uh, stepfather of the bride should have at least an age-appropriate boyfriend. Call me old fashioned, but I just do. Oh, Karl. What's that on your face? What? Oh, my God, are you wearing makeup? Less than you. You really are spreading your wings. I think I'm leaving the country in the nick of time. - I'm off to the ladies' room - I'll order you a gimlet. Simone? Hi. Uh, you are Dr. Bennett's wife, right? Maureen. I also work in his practice as a nurse. Well, isn't that nice? I don't know quite how to say this. But... do you know your husband's a homosexual? Yes, I know. And you said it just fine. I realize it's none of my business. I'm just trying to be a good person. And like all good people, you just couldn't wait to tell me. I'm going now. Feel free to adjust your halo. Has Karl told you he's sick? What? I can see he hasn't. Karl isn't sick. He saw my husband three days ago. He has that new disease that all the gay men are spreading. That's a lie. He's the third man my husband's seen who's had it. The first two are dead. I'm so sorry. I just thought you should know. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know it sounds unbelievable and faintly ridiculous, but bear with me on this... Oh, hello, darling. It's perfect timing. I was just telling everyone the story of our trip to Venice, when you accidentally knocked that gondolier into the water. Now, did that really happen? Or is Karl just embellishing? No, that-that's not the kind of thing Karl would lie about. So, there he was, dripping wet, hacking up great lungfuls of the Grand Canal, and I realized it's very difficult to maintain one's dignity... Hey. - Hey. Where have you been all morning? - Ah... out. Doing stuff. Doing great stuff, in fact. Come with me outside. I've got something to show you. - Come on. - You never came to bed last night. Did you get any sleep at all? No. No, it turns out one of the side effects of near-constant cocaine use is a wee bit of insomnia. Come on. - Oh! Wow! - Right? You like it? - It... uh... you bought this? - I did. Well, uh, technically American Express bought it. But that bill's gonna get paid the second my first script payment comes through. You like it? Look, I know you've been working really hard, and I get that you'd want to treat yourself... Me? No. Whoa. No, I didn't... This isn't for me. Y-You bought me a car? I did. - Shut. Up. - I won't. This is me saying thank you. - For what? - My God, for everything. For all the help you gave me with the script. For standing by me when Taylor lost her mind... Oh, God... Taylor's not gonna like this. Well, you know what? Taylor doesn't get a vote, okay? It looks expensive. Are you sure? Well, I made you a promise, right? I said when this money came through, I would take care of you. People have made me a lot of promises in my life. Nobody's ever kept one before. Well, this is me keeping mine. And this is just the beginning. So... do you like it? It's perfect. Just keep going straight. So I've been doing some research, finding jobs a pregnant woman can do. I already have a job. You shouldn't be on your feet all day when you're expecting, but don't worry. There are plenty of ways a girl in your condition can make a living. Are there? Sure. You could be a pin setter in a bowling alley. All you'd have to do is punch buttons. - I found an opening at an alley in Anaheim. - Now take a left. Or... there's a place hiring switchboard operators. For that, you'd have to move to Barstow. It sounds like you're trying to get rid of me. Don't be silly. I just thought it might be easier for you to make a fresh start in a new city. - Well, I'm not moving. - Okay. Just know I'm here for you. For anything you need. Thank you. Oh... uh, pull over, this is it. This must be a mistake. A doctor wouldn't have his office in here. No, this is it. Are you sure you have the address right? Sheila, I lied. I'm not here to see a doctor. I don't understand. I'm sorry. I just can't have this baby. What are you talking about? Please do not make me say this out loud. What you're going to do, it's illegal. I know. God, how did you even hear about this place? A girl at the diner referred me. You... Excuse me. You can't do this, it's not right. Sheila, please do not make this harder than it already is. I'm Sally Jones. We spoke on the phone. Who's she? My friend. She'll drive me home afterwards. - You got the money? - I do. Come on in. Sheila. Please. I really need a friend right now, more than ever. - Here you go, son. - Thank you, sir. I'll have your car here in just a second. - Terrific night. - Lovely seeing you all. Let's do it again very soon. Good night, Simone. See you at the wedding. All right, we're alone. You can tell me now. Tell you what? How I've upset you. And don't say you're fine. You've barely said two words to me the entire evening. Wait till we're in the car. Can I at least have a headline? I ran into your doctor's wife in the ladies' room. Don't think I've ever met her. She also works as a nurse. In his office. What did she say? You're sick. Well, two things: first of all... I'm not sick. Secondly, what a gossipy bitch. - Are you saying she lied? - I'm not... symptomatic. - I feel fine. - So what's the makeup hiding? A spot. - Don't you mean a lesion? - Oh, come on, it's miniscule. Do you have any idea how scared I am? - You don't have it. - What? Look, the fact is, it can only be transmitted through blood or bodily fluids, and we rarely had sex, and never without a condom. Is that what you think? - That I'm scared for myself? - Darling, darling, darling, I, I, I... I should have told you, my love, I just... I did... I just didn't want to spoil your trip. Oh, God, the trip. Look, I'm so sorry. I-I-I-I promise I... I-I will call once a week while you're away, with, with full medical updates. You think I'm still going? That I'd leave you at a time like this? And what would staying achieve? Other than letting me know that you think I won't make it past Labor Day? You need care, Karl. Specialists. And at least one doctor whose wife is not the goddamn town crier! I know how much Tommy means to you. I'm staying with you, and that is the end of this discussion. Thank you. - Do you want some whiskey? - Whiskey? It's good to get a little drunk before you start. Helps with the pain. - No, thank you. - Suit yourself. Just give me a couple of minutes. I got to get some plastic over the table. She's doing this in the kitchen? Apparently. But it's an invasive procedure. It requires a clean environment. Sterilized instruments. Well, this is all I can afford. I'm out of options, Sheila. Please understand. There's something you don't know. There's something I need to tell you. What's that? I had a child once, but she died. I left the gate to the backyard open. She wandered out into the street and she was hit by a car. It's been years, but I think about her every day. Sometimes, late at night, I wonder what kind of young woman she'd have turned into. How could you tell me something like that right now? Are you... are you trying to make me feel guilty? - No, you don't understand. - No, I think you don't understand, Sheila. - I have to do this. - Honey, I'm trying to say... I think my daughter would have grown up to be a lot like you. That is one of the reasons I love you. But right now I'm afraid for you because women die in places like this. I can't let that happen. Sheila, I'm single and I'm broke. I can't raise a baby. We'll figure it out. We just need time to think. - Let me help you. - How? Well, I'll... I'll get some... I'll get my hands on some money. We can go somewhere else, somewhere safe, but please, let's get out of here. Okay. Okay. Hello? Yeah, this is she. No, I haven't lost my Amex. Why? Suspicious activity? Um, how much was spent? Nice car. Taylor. - Were you in the house? - I came to talk to Eli so he could explain to me why my credit card is maxed out, and then I saw you pull up in this brand-new car. Well, I-I don't know when he'll be home. He has a meeting at Paramount and... He bought it for you, didn't he? I told him it was too much. - When? - The moment he gave it to me. No. I'm asking when did he give it to you? Before I saw you in the park this morning or after? After. So why didn't you insist he take it back? I was so surprised, I didn't know what to say. Surprised? Jade, I had just told you that when Eli is high, - he's stupid with money. - Well, I don't think it's stupid. I spend every day cooking and cleaning, running errands and looking after you both. I think it's nice that someone actually wanted to say thank you. You want a thank you? Okay, fine, Jade. Thank you. Now give me the keys. - Why? - 'Cause I'm gonna return the car, obviously. No. - What do you mean no? - You can't return the car. It's not yours. Eli bought it for me. Yeah, but he's coked out of his mind. To accept a gift from a man in that condition is not a good look. My God. Why are you acting like this? I haven't done anything wrong. You are taking advantage of this situation. You're using Eli. Just give me the keys. Stop it. If anyone is a user, Taylor, it's you. You have been using me for months. I saved you. I brought you into my home. You did that for yourself, not for me. Your marriage was falling apart and you needed a distraction. Eli wasn't writing or making money, and you were so angry you could barely even look at him. By the way, I'm the one who got him writing again. I did that for you. You're welcome. I keep wondering why Eli started using again. Are you the reason? Oh, my God. We shouldn't be doing this. Fighting and throwing blame at each other. We're supposed to be a family. Stop it. Stop it, Jade! Eli and I are a family. You are a houseguest. That's all. You know what, Jade? Go upstairs, get your stuff. I want you out of my house now! That's not gonna happen. You can leave again if you want, but I'm not going anywhere, and I'm keeping the car. I'm not gonna let you take it away from me. Tommy, come in. Hi. I have great news. I returned your brooch and I got your replacement gift. Well, it's not a traditional gift so much as a tribute to you. I sure hope you like it because, uh, I can't really return it. Hey. You look sad. What's wrong? We need to talk. Hey. Hey, great news. Paramount wants to talk to me about adapting a novel. I got a meeting on Friday. I'm telling you, this comeback shit is really starting to get real. I'm really, really happy for you. What's wrong? Taylor stopped by. I'm guessing that didn't go so well, huh? Oh, Eli. I hate this. I hate that she's putting me in this position. What position? What are you talking about? She wants me to get the passwords to your accounts, so she can take away all your money. Cancel the trip? I can't leave when Karl is sick. Yeah, but-but he's not even in the hospital. Not yet, but this disease is unpredictable. I need to be here. No, that's not fair. This was supposed to be the best summer of my life. And this could be the last summer of Karl's life, so please stop sulking. - What are you doing? - I need a drink. You're barely 18. Yeah, well, dating you has aged me. Give me that. One week, that's all I ask. Nothing can happen in-in a-a week. What would be the point? I wouldn't enjoy myself. In Paris? With me? My husband is dying. Can you not understand what that means? So what's gonna happen to us? I don't think there can be an "us." Look... I know that I can act like a kid sometimes, but if you give me another chance, I can be more mature. No. You stay young. I'm the one who needs to grow up. That might be Karl's doctor. I, I'm gonna take it in the other room. - Simone... - No. Tommy. All right, great, and you can transfer those funds today, right? All right, thank you. Yeah, I'll talk to you. Bye. All right. All right, so my business manager's on it. He's gonna reset the passwords to all my accounts. And I spoke to Lamar. I forbid him to speak to Taylor, so she can't use him to try to get to my script payments. That's a relief. Do you think it'll be enough? What do you mean? Taylor was here, in the house, while we were out. Maybe we should think about changing the locks. Whoa. Uh, I mean, she's my wife and she loves me. In her way she's just trying to protect me. She's trying to control you. There's a difference. I don't know. I mean, maybe I should just call her. No! I mean, I know you want to believe that she's gonna come around, but you have to know, deep down, there's no way she's ever gonna get on board with the idea of you using. And she's threatening to call your dad. My dad? Are you fucking kidding me? Why? She knows that I don't speak to him. Goddamn it. She can't just fucking do that. She's trying to make you feel small. I hate that she's treating you this way. The last thing I want is to see you lose everything you've been working so hard to get. Who are you calling? Our handyman. You're right. We're gonna change those fucking locks. Rob's got an awful lot of old sports equipment. And he never uses any of it. So I'm taking it to the pawnshop and giving the cash to April. Well, that'll be a nice chunk of change. It will be easier for her to make a rational decision about the baby if she's not so worried about money. I still can't believe you talked her out of it. That horrible place? I couldn't let her stay. Here, put this in the big pile, please. I got to admit I'm a bit surprised. Surprised? She's pregnant with your husband's kid. Most wives in that situation wouldn't care how rusty the knives were. Couldn't let anything happen to April or her baby. Honey, y-you know that she could still decide to get rid of it. I know. That's why I have to work hard over the next few days to change her mind. Well, talk to her about adoption. You know, there's-there's plenty of nice people out there who can't have kids. I'll mention that. There's also another possibility. What's that? Rob and I could raise the baby. What? I've got it all figured out. I'll support April until the baby arrives, then I'll offer to raise it. As far as Rob's concerned, I could arrange some scenario, finding it in a bassinet in a park, abandoned. No one would ever have to know the truth. Rob would have his child, April could have her career, everyone would be happy. What's wrong? At first I thought it was funny, you becoming friends with your husband's slut. - Sheila, that word. - And then, when you kept getting closer to her, I thought you were a little nutty. But no. You're sick. I'm not sick. Your kid is dead. And you're trying to replace her with April's baby. That is not what I'm doing. That is what you're doing from where I'm standing. You're not allowed to judge me. Not until you pick out Benny's casket and dress him in his Sunday best and put him in the ground. Until you do that, I don't want to hear another word from you. Hello? Simone, thank God you answered. Naomi. What's going on? I ran out without my purse, and I don't have my insurance card or my ID, and the housekeeper isn't answering, and I don't have anyone else to call. Slow down. What's going on? Where are you? I'm at the hospital. I need my purse. Can you please bring it? Well, of course. What's happened? Tommy's been in a car accident. I-I'll be right there. Yes. Can I help you? I'm here to speak to Rob Stanton. - Do you have an appointment? - No. But I'm not leaving until I speak to him. I beg your pardon? Tell him it's April. Oh. So you know who I am. I do. I'm sorry, but he won't see you. I really think that you should go. Miss! Please stop. I'm sorry, Mr. Stanton. I told her you were busy. It's all right. What do you want? One lousy minute of your time. You owe me that, don't you think? Claire, go ahead and shut the door. I'm sorry I didn't return your phone calls. I thought a clean break was just better for... I'm pregnant. Don't worry. I don't need anything from you. I'm not keeping it. The way you treated me, I wasn't even going to tell you. But I'm not a bad person. You have a right to know. Anyway, that's all I came here to say, so... goodbye. Have a nice life. Wait. Simone, thank you so much. - Where's Tommy? - They're doing some scans of his head. He has a possible concussion. They need to be sure there's no swelling. But he'll be all right? He's pretty banged up. He has a bad cut on his leg, but he'll recover. - Oh, thank God. - He was driving while drunk. I couldn't believe it when the nurse told me. Tommy would never... God. What's happened to my boy? I feel so awful. You're so sweet to be here. Even now, when you're going through your own hell. What do you mean? I know about Karl, how he's sick with that gay disease. I don't know what you've heard, but... Ida Coy told me. She was in one of the stalls when you were talking to Dr. Bennett's wife. Oh, God. Well, please don't tell anyone else. Karl would be so upset. I don't care about Karl. You're the one I'm concerned for. Are you okay? Well, I don't have it, if that's what you're asking. Well, I hope not. No one seems to know how those people are spreading it. We brought your son to a room - if you want to see him. - Yes, please, let's go. Oh, but we can only allow family back there. Oh, Simone is practically family. Sorry, it's policy. It's fine. Just-just - call me later. - I will. And I will be there for you when you need me. Truth is, I fell in love with Jade without really knowing who she was. And what's worse is I brought her into my home. Now she's sleeping in my bed and I'm living in a hotel. I need her out of my house. But she's enabling my drug addict husband and I don't think he'll just let her go. Not to mention the fact that you and I both know how intensely she can react when she feels threatened. If I'm gonna get her out of the house, I need to be smart. I need leverage. And I thought you might be just the person to help me with that. Why would I help you? I'm thinking, you scratch my back, I scratch yours. All you got to do is tell me where it itches. They set my bail at $10,000. They seem to think I'm dangerous. Well, as luck would have it, I brought my checkbook. Well, in that case, how can I help? Tell me everything you know about Jade. Well, for starters, that's not her real name. Oh, shit. Hold on, darling. You ain't heard nothing yet. Oh. Oh, my poor baby. How is his leg? Well, he needed some stitches, but he will be good as new in no time. What in the world? Who's Simone?
