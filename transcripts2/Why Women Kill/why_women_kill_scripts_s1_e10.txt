 Taylor came to see me in jail. You really fucked me this time! Your membership to the club has been revoked. It's because I'm ill. It was you. You seduced my child. Do you think that I would be satisfied just getting you kicked out of a country club? I am just getting started, bitch. Dad always said that you were vindictive. I am still your mother. No, from now on, you're just some lady that I used to know. - You pulling out? - Not yet.

 I'm waiting for someone. MARY: My husband likes to threaten me with a loaded gun he keeps in his bedside drawer. BETH ANN: Our daughter died because of me. I'm the one who's responsible. The last time I slept with your husband was the day your child died. While you were coming in the front door, I ran around the side of the house. Did Rob know you had not closed the gate? I called him that night and I told him. What can I do for you? I need to buy a gun. ("L-O-V-E" by Michael Feinstein playing) ♪ "L" is for the way you look ♪ ♪ At me ♪ ♪ "O" is for the only one ♪ ♪ I see ♪ ♪ "V" is very, very ♪ ♪ Extraordinary ♪ ♪ "E" is even more ♪ ♪ Than anyone that you adore can ♪ ♪ Love is all ♪ ♪ That I can give to you ♪ ♪ Love is more ♪ ♪ Than just a game for two ♪ ♪ Two in love can make it ♪ ♪ Take my heart and please don't break it ♪ ♪ Love was made ♪ ♪ For me and you... ♪ So, what do you think? (exhales) It's impressive. Square footage? 5,000. Give or take. Four big bedrooms upstairs. Got kids? We had a little girl. Her name was Emily. Was? Could you excuse us a moment? You've got to stop telling total strangers our daughter died. He asked me a question. It's been over a year. How are we gonna move forward in our lives if we keep talking about what happened? I don't even understand what we're doing here. The house we have now is fine. It's got too many memories. We need a fresh start. I mean, this could be good for us. Don't you want to find a way to be happy again? Of course I do. Well, then let me buy this for you. If you do that, I'll spend every day just trying to put the smile back on your face. The one I fell in love with. I guess we could be happy here. Of course we can. Now where's that smile I love? I bought a gun yesterday. What? I'd left an appointment at my cancer doctors, and I passed the most adorable gun shop. And I bought this little revolver. Why do we need a gun? There have been robberies in the neighborhood. Mrs. Betz on the corner? Some thief smashed her window, reached in, and took her new purse right off her end table. - Have I met her? - Anyway, I don't feel safe. So I got this gun, and I'm storing it here. And I've already put in the bullets. You're keeping the gun loaded? If someone attacks us, I don't think we'd want to waste time looking for bullets. Do you? This is a nice street. Nothing bad is going to happen to us. You never know. So... what do you think? You were right to bring us here. So many possibilities. Yes, the floor plan's good, but really, the color of the walls... Before we go any further, state law compels me to disclose that a murder took place here. Someone was murdered in this house? Was it the decorator? - Oh. (laughs) - (door opens) Simone! - Naomi! - (exclaims) I saw your car out front. Tell me that you are buying this place. I live a block away. We would be neighbors. Karl, this is my friend Naomi from the country club. You must be the dashing new boyfriend I keep hearing about. Not just the boyfriend. - I've, uh, been promoted. - Stop. You're engaged? Oh, well, now you definitely need a bigger house. - And who's this charming young man? - Tommy. This is my son Tommy. Tommy, this is Simone. You're pretty. - Oh. - (laughs) Kids say the cutest things. Oh, hands off, young man. She's spoken for. Oh, Simone, please tell me you'll take the house. I'd absolutely kill to have you here. Oh, it would be fun, wouldn't it? Being close to my best friend. (tires screeching) Simone! (engine hissing) (both panting) Are you all right? Oh, my God. What happened? (bystanders clamoring) My mother tried to kill you. What? Oh, my God, is she alive? Tommy. Someone call a doctor! - Okay. - And the police! So... what do you think? I mean... I love it. I say, let's do it. - What? - I want to buy this house. Can I talk with my husband for a moment in private, please? Take your time. What? Dude, are you crazy? Are you cra...? Did you not see that pool? And that kitchen is huge. Yeah, and it needs a complete remodel. We can't afford that. D-Don't worry about the money, all right? My career is taking off. The reviews for Jenny from Yesterday are through the roo. Yeah, I know, but even so, it's still risky. Risky? Are you hearing yourself right now? - Do you know who you sound like? - Who? Me... when we were talking about having an open marriage? Okay, that's not the same thing. No. I was... I was nervous. I was unsure that we could make it work, but you convinced me. And now our life is so much more exciting for it. Now think about how much even more exciting our life would be - with that fucking kitchen, right? - (both laughing) Oh, sweetie, you still have that cold? It's fine. I'm good. I'm good. Just, Taylor, trust me. Okay? Believe in me. I promise you I will not let you down. Take it slow. - God, everything hurts. - (sighs) Well, here's something to ease the pain. I went by the house. All of Jade's stuff is gone. That was fast. Yeah. Well, she knows we're onto her. She can't just stick around, waiting for the cops to show up. Oh, speaking of the house, I, uh, got you a little something. A business card? Yeah. For Lamar's Realtor. If it's okay with you, I want to sell the house. Really? Yeah, it just feels like every wrong turn we've made can be traced back to the moment where I talked you into buying it. No house... wouldn't have met Jade. No Jade, no relapse. I mean, we'd lose a lot of stress. The mortgage payments alone. (laughs) - Look at that smile. - (laughs) All right. So how much downsizing are we up for? Townhouse? Condo? Fuck it. Let's just buy a field. We can pitch a tent. - Love it. - (laughs) Tent in a field. We'd be living the dream. And the best part about moving... Jade won't be able to find us. Where do you think she went? I don't know. Let's just hope she's a thousand miles away by now. Who's Duke? My grandfather. Grammy Sue gave that to him for their first wedding anniversary. He wore it every day, but he never wound it. He always used to say that "When I met my Susie, it was like time stood still." Sweet. Give you 35. Hundred? No. Dollars. It's worth much more than that. Sentimental-wise, maybe. Cash-wise, it's worth $35. - Well, I need more. - All right. I'll throw in an extra five for the story. And 'cause I like your... face. How about a grand? I don't like your face that much. Okay, well, then a couple hundred. - Honey, I told you... - Please. You don't understand what I've been through lately. I've lost everything, and I just need a little... What you need is to give the waterworks a rest. I made you my offer, so either take it or get the hell out. The fuck?! I'm calling the cops! Yeah, I get that a lot. (doorbell rings) Beth Ann. Morning, Mary. I hope I'm not interrupting? No, not at all. Ralph just left for work. I know. I waited for him to go. I need to speak to you privately. - What's going on? - I've thought of a way to solve our respective marital difficulties. You have? I've come up with a plan on how to kill our husbands. Please invite me in. This is the sort of thing we should discuss over coffee. That's the plan. Any thoughts? It's crazy. - We'd never get away with it. - But we would. Think about it. Technically speaking, we wouldn't be doing anything illegal. How could we be sure that Rob and Ralph would even swallow the bait? That's the beauty of the plan. It's tailor-made to fit their horribly predictable personalities. What if someone discovers what we've done? I don't plan on telling anyone. Do you? I don't know. Ralph deserves to die. And... after everything Rob's put you through, he's just as bad. But the Bible says, "Thou shalt not kill." God might not understand. Maybe not. But I'm sure God's wife will. Now, what do you say? Oh. Tommy. You seem surprised to see me. Well, we're such social pariahs these days, I'm surprised to see anyone. At this point, I'd roll out the red carpet for a Jehovah's Witness. How are you feeling? Delightful. Simone's in the kitchen. ♪ ♪ How is your mother's physical therapy going? Better. She took a few steps today. I still think that you should have pressed charges. She said she lost control of the car. I choose to believe her. Nobody else does. All of her friends at the country club, the ones that she turned against you and Karl, they finally found out Mom's crazy and they dropped her. Oh. Poor Naomi. "Poor Naomi"? Come on. You must be a little pleased. The woman I'm trying to become would draw no satisfaction from this at all. Fortunately, I'm not that woman just yet. I'm thinking about canceling my trip to Paris. You can't let your mother guilt you into staying. I'd be staying for you, not her. Karl's getting worse, isn't he? I'll take good care of him. But who will take care of you? I'll be fine. Oh, you should go. Karl has a doctor's appointment. I'm sorry our relationship caused such a scandal. I try to tell people I'm the one who pursued you, but they refuse to believe it was my fault. You say that like we did something we should regret. I don't regret one moment we shared. Now go. Have the most wonderful summer of your life. Study art. Drink wine. Think of me every now and then. I'll think of you constantly. I love you. I won't be the last woman you say that to. But I'm proud to be the first. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Here it is. COLE: Now, you're sure you want to part with this? Oh, I'd love to keep it, but the truth is, we need the money. Simone, are things really as bad as all that? Once the art gallery went under, we lost our health insurance. And Karl's medical bills have been outrageous. Is there anything I can do? You could buy another painting. Perhaps you'd like to have me hanging in your living room? Ah... Why don't I just pay you another thousand for this one? That's very kind. And somewhat insulting. Take care, Cole. KARL: Simone? Yes, Karl? I need you. Is everything okay? Yes, I'm just trying to make myself presentable. Would you do my neck? Oh, of course. Are you going somewhere? Tim from my support group's just got out of hospital. Harold's holding a brunch in his honor. Oh, that should be nice. You haven't tasted his cooking. I'm sure we'll all be back in the emergency room by dessert. (chuckles) You are such a bitch. I should hope so. I did study with a master. Oh, I heard the doorbell. Who was it? Cole stopped by to pick up the painting. Oh, Lord, I feel so dreadful about that. I-I know how much you love that piece. It's okay. At least we can pay the mortgage now. Or most of it. (choked up): I am s... I am so sorry. Stop it. We are fine. Uh, you are right. We are, uh, two... bitch goddesses. And we will not be defeated. Now turn. (birds chirping) (doorbell rings) (sighs) ♪ ♪ (sighs) What did I tell all you this morning before we left the house? Huh? What did I say? Not to embarrass you. I can never go back to that store ever again because of what you little freaks did to that poor mannequin. (all giggling) Go inside. Now! (kids chattering and laughing) Hello. I'm not sure if you remember who I am. I know who you are. Can you tell me who you are? Let's start with the headline, hon. I'm not Rob Stanton's wife. Come on in. I think it's time someone told you the truth. Thank you, Lamar. Your support means a lot. Yeah. Yeah. I will see you on the other side, man. Okay. Bye. So, how you gonna stay busy while I'm at rehab? Guessing the short answer is "girls, girls, girls"? (chuckles) Well, funny you should mention that. I thought maybe we could rethink the whole open marriage thing. - Really? - Yeah. You know, we should focus on us for a while. Go to therapy. And three's a crowd. Especially in couples counseling. Okay. - What, you don't like that idea? - No. It's just... I mean, obviously, your sexuality is really important. And... I just don't want you to have to give any part of that up. It is important to me. But like I've always said, my love story is with you. And I would choose you over a few casual hookups any day of the week. It would just be you and me? Forsaking all others? Till death do us part. (exhales) Did we just become Republicans? I think we did. Hector, hi. Come on in. Karl is taking a nap. Should I wake him? Uh, no. Actually, uh, I'm here to see you. Oh. What's going on? Remember last Sunday, when I took Karl to that brunch at Harold's? Yes. Thank you for driving him. So, Harold called me today. He thinks Karl stole some pills from his medicine cabinet. What kind of pills? Sleeping pills. And the same thing happened two weeks ago when we went to Billy's for bridge. I see. Karl puts on a brave face, but I know how depressed he's been. And I'm just so worried. You did the right thing telling me. Simone, I'm so sorry to dump this on you. But you've always been the only one who can get through to him. I will take care of it. Thank you. So, while you copy the letter in your handwriting, I'll be upstairs cleaning out your closet. You said Ralph gets home around 6:45? Sometimes as early as 6:30. Rob gets home around 6:15, and it's almost 5:00. We need to get cracking. Beth Ann? When Ralph reads this... he will absolutely get violent. We can only hope. ♪ You look like an angel ♪ ♪ Look like an angel ♪ ♪ Walk like an angel ♪ ♪ Walk like an angel ♪ ♪ Talk like an angel ♪ ♪ But I got wise ♪ ♪ You're the devil in disguise ♪ ♪ Oh, yes, you are ♪ ♪ The devil in disguise ♪ ♪ Mm-hmm ♪ ♪ I thought that I was in heaven ♪ ♪ But I was sure surprised ♪ ♪ Heaven help me ♪ ♪ I didn't see the devil ♪ ♪ In your eyes ♪ ♪ You look like an angel ♪ ♪ Look like an angel ♪ ♪ Walk like an angel ♪ ♪ Walk like an angel ♪ ♪ Talk like an angel ♪ ♪ But I got wise ♪ ♪ You're the devil in disguise ♪ ♪ Oh, yes, you are ♪ ♪ The devil in disguise. ♪ I'm going to the farmers market. Wearing that? Well, just because I have to shop with the frumps doesn't mean I have to dress like them. Can I get you anything? Oh, yes, actually, um, I could use a hundred sleeping pills to replace the ones you took out of my dresser. You noticed. That was fast. Yes, last year you were angry with me because I didn't take enough pills to kill myself, and now you won't let me have any. You need to choose a policy and stick to it, my girl. We have to fight this disease. We can't give into it. Have you really forgotten how bad my last bout of pneumonia was? I wasn't sure I was leaving the hospital. But you did, and now you're fine. Darling, I'm not fine. If my T cells were people, I couldn't get up a bridge game, so please, please give me the pills back. I already washed them down the sink. Well, then, you'll just force me to do something more gruesome. So, hang myself or blow my brains out. You choose. So help me, if you do anything disfiguring, I will give you an open-casket funeral with no makeup and fluorescent lighting. Dear God, I married the devil herself. Oh, I know we won't be together always, but why subtract even a day we could share? Fine. Fine. You win. Actually, um, I'm going to a birthday party this afternoon. Maybe you'd like to join me. - It's for Jimmy Loftus. - (gasps) Oh, I'd love to see him again. He's always a hoot. How is he doing? Well, I'm afraid he's had a bit of a setback. He's in the hospital. Oh, no. Yes, the party's in his room. If you come, I'm sure it would lift his spirits. Oh, I'd love to come. I'm so glad. ELI: Oh, thank God. - All right. - Honey... Come here, you. Mmm. - Ow. Ooh, my ribs. - Oh. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, no. No, no. Don't stop, don't stop. I can take it. (laughs) (panting) I thought you said Jade took the dog when she left. She did. (clattering) Hey. (quietly): Hey. - What are you doing here? - I'm making dinner. Oh. Okay. I think you need to leave. I know things got a little funky for a minute there, but there's no reason that we can't go back to the way we were before. Oh, I think there are a lot of reasons. - Yeah, Jade, please... - Her name's not Jade. Who cares? Am I not allowed to reinvent myself? I mean, fuck. Okay, you know what, let's just all settle down. You guys act like everything that happened is my fault; it's not. I could have gone to Europe, but you begged me to stay. You pretended to love me, and you promised that you would always take care of me. (voice breaking): It's not fair. You're right. You're right, it's not fair. Okay, just stop. I don't believe one thing about you. Least of all your tears. I didn't pretend to love you, I did. But that's because I didn't know who you really are. You tried to trick us. You played us, and you lost. It's done. Now get out. I'll go... but you have to pay me first. You think you can shake us down? - Honey. - It costs money to start over. We're not aiding and abetting a criminal. You owe me. Eli sold our script for a million dollars. Give me ten grand, and I'll go. I'm not gonna pay you to leave. I'm just gonna call the cops. All right, you know what, let's just hold on a second. Okay? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go talk to her. We're gonna work this out. I mean, after all, you've been through a lot, but you're not a bad person. Right? No, no, okay. (whispers harshly): How could you leave me alone with that psychopath? I can't find my fucking phone. Where is it? (smoke alarm beeping) Smoke alarm. She's burning down the goddamn house. (sighs) Hey. So what, exactly, is Jimmy's prognosis? Well, whatever it is, this is a party, so please try to smile. Darling, I can smile through anything. Karl, Simone, you made it. Hello, hello. Oh, let us through, we want to see the birthday boy. (monitor beeping steadily) KEN: Jimmy, look who's here. It's Karl and Simone. Happy birthday, Jimmy. And you should see what Simone is wearing. I think it's Lagerfeld. Uh, Karl, Simone, I wanted you to meet Jimmy's mom and his sister Terry. They just got in from Iowa. It is so lovely to meet you both. I can't tell you how comforting it's been to find Jimmy here surrounded by such loving friends. KEN: Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet, honey. I made my famous carrot cake. You are having a piece, Mr. Jim, even if they have to puree it and drip it into your arm. Can he hear us? Of course he can. Everyone's here now. Time to sing. Here we go. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Jimmy ♪ Excuse me. ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ I don't understand how he got so sick so quickly. This is the disease. I've watched it happen to Clive, to Harry, to Alistair... It's just horrifying. You know, Jimmy once told me he was scared of ending up like this. Connected to tubes, wasting away. - But here he is. - (gasps weakly) You know what I'm driving at. You're not that sick. Yet. But we've seen my future. I would rather choose life, but life is... ...off the table. The only thing I can choose is when to die and... how. I brought you here today because I needed you to understand. Do you? (sobs) Thank you. Rob. You're home. And starving. Is dinner ready? The day got away from me. I had to order Chinese takeout. But it's Thursday. I was looking forward to meatloaf. If it helps, I made you a shaker of martinis. You could have a few while we wait. Now you're talkin'. Thanks. Hi. Are you Taylor Harding? Yeah. Wow, you got here fast. Come on in. Eli, the police are here. Already? I'm sorry, were you expecting us? Yeah, we reported a break-in. That was, like, ten minutes ago. We're not here about any break-in. We came to talk about Duke Riley. What about Duke? You filed a police report six weeks ago accusing him of assault. - Yes. - And then four days ago, you posted his bail. I did. Why are you asking? Duke Riley was murdered yesterday. His landlord found his body in his apartment. He had been repeatedly stabbed. Do you have any idea who might have done this? I think we do. Whoa, this'll be my third one. Oh, who's counting? Mrs. Stanton, are you trying to get me drunk? I just wanted you to be relaxed so we could have a little chat. About what? About the day our daughter died. This will do it? Yes, just the one dose. And you won't feel any pain, you'll just... sleep? So I'm told. Are you sure you don't want Hector here? No, no. We've, um, we've said our goodbyes. I-I mean, he wanted to be here, but... well, he's so bloody emotional. The mere mention of my death, he starts wailing like a car alarm. Be nice. He loves you. I know. But to be honest, uh, I just wanted it to be the two of us. You deserve to have more than just me. You should have a huge, glorious party to send you off. You are a glorious party, all by yourself. I knew that the first moment I laid eyes on you. You'll always be the love of my life. So, what happens now? Well, uh, firstly, I... I'd like you to change into the red gown I bought you in Venice. (scoffs) What's wrong with this one? I prefer the red. All right. But this is the last time I'll let you edit my wardrobe. When you've changed, come down to the living room. I have a nice surprise for you. I don't want to talk about Emily. Well, I do. I've been thinking about that day a lot lately. And I've remembered something. What's that? I absolutely locked the gate after I brought in the trash can. Huh. Well, you must not have. How else did Emily get out into the street? Perhaps you could come up with another explanation. Think. I'm not feeling well. My darling. You can't possibly imagine how important this moment is to me. Please. Did anything happen that day you haven't told me? No. Thank you. For what? You've made this all so much easier. Well, she's obviously dangerous. You might want to think about staying someplace for a few days until we locate her. We'll check into a hotel tonight. FEMALE DETECTIVE: And we'll put a car on the street outside until you leave. Don't worry. She won't get past us. - Good night. - TAYLOR: Night. (exhales) Okay, I was trying to be cool in front of the detectives, but oh, my God, Jade killed Duke. - I know. I know. - Wait, do you think she's actually gonna come back here? TAYLOR: We can't stick around long enough to find out. - What about the dog? - We'll take it with us. You feed her first, I'll go start packing. - Okay. All right. Come on, Teacup. - Okay. Mary, I'm home. (sighs) Bring me a beer! And I want it in a mug this time. Mary? Mary? MARY: Dearest Ralph. I haven't been happy for quite some time. But that's not why I've decided to leave you. I've met someone else. A man who makes me happy. So I'm leaving you for Rob Stanton. He loves me in a way you never could. Your ex-wife, Mary. - (quietly): Shit. - (drawer shuts) (gun clicks) (footsteps receeding) (rings) Aren't you gonna get that? Must have been a wrong number. Well, when's the Chinese food getting here? I'm hungry. I'm sure it'll arrive any second. (pounding on door) See? Wait. Are you sure that's the delivery guy? He sounds angry. Who else could it be? You are so beautiful. Look who's talking. Are you ready? Not just yet. Have you changed your mind? No. No. But I would love just one more dance. A tango? What else? ELI: Babe, what should I pack? Just the essentials. How is this essential? Look, just 'cause we're going into hiding doesn't mean we can't look good. Hey, have you seen my laptop? I think it's downstairs. Check the dining room table. - Okay, I'll be right back. - All right. So it's true. What are you doing here? I won't be here long. I just want to know why. Now is not a good time. You have to go. What the hell? I'm sorry, Rob. Uh... honey, this is... Don't bother lying. She knows that we were having an affair. - What? - BETH ANN: Please. - You have to go! - You know how I always talk to you about my friend Sheila? This is Sheila. (groans) Uh, okay... I came to the diner that day to confront you. But you were so nice. And you said we could be friends. Hold on. You're friends with my mistress? Fiancée. Can we talk about this later? What could you have been thinking? Oh, you're a fine one to talk. You've been having an affair for months. You've been planning on leaving me. Oh, my God. Do you even have cancer? Cancer? You have cancer? Well, this is just awkward. (pounding on door) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (clicks) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hi there. You must be Beth Ann? You must be Simone. Come in. - It's nice to finally meet you. - Likewise. I have the keys around here somewhere. Let me look. One of the reasons I wanted to meet was because I had a question. It's a bit awkward. What would you like to know? The realtor told me that someone was murdered in this house? It's true. My husband was killed... right where you're standing. - Oh, dear. - Our neighbor broke in and accused Rob of sleeping with his wife. Shot him dead. He was executed last year. So sad. Aunt Beth, I'm packed. Can we go? In a sec. Elsie, this is Simone, - the woman who bought our house. - Hi, there. You're so pretty. She's your niece? The daughter of my friend, April Warner. But I've been helping take care of her since she was a baby. April is a singer, you know. My mom's gonna be on Broadway. That's why we sold the house. We're moving to New York. Oh, how exciting. Here are your keys. I hope to have a very happy life in this house. A happy life isn't hard to come by. The trick is to not regret the choices you made along the way. Yes. Well... good luck with everything. Likewise. Take care of my house. I'll give it lots of love. There you go. Thank you. I just know that we're gonna love living here. I certainly hope so. So when did you buy the house? '74. But after my husband died, I rented the house out. Then it was the headquarters for my foundation. I raise money for AIDS research. Yeah, we've read up on you. You've done such amazing work. I ended up living a very rich life, once I stopped worrying about money. Paulo, I'm ready. Is that a Thomas J. Harte? - Oh, you know his work? - TAYLOR: Sure. - Yeah, we saw a show of his at the Whitney last year. - That's right, yeah. Oh, isn't that wonderful? I always hoped Tommy would go far. Tommy? Is he a friend of yours? A friend? You could say that. My face is tattooed on his ass. Paulo, push. (sighs) Well, it's been lovely to meet you, Taylor. And just know that Andrew and I will take wonderful care of your home. Aw, well, I hope you'll enjoy it. We will. And I'm sorry for everything that happened to you here. Can't imagine what you went through. It was an awful night. But it could have been worse. So you really have a rifle collection? Yeah. They're all in that box over there. Hey, check this out. This is me on safari in Africa. - Look at that. - No way. Well, I-I never knew there were Jews that were into hunting. We exist. But it's not as cruel to the animals, because we miss so frequently. TAYLOR: Oh, before I forget, here are your keys. Thank you. So, what about the two of you? Found a new place to live? - Uh, yeah. Well, actually... - (phone buzzing) ...we're moving back to our old condo. After living in a mansion. That is some serious downsizing. Yeah. For us, it turns out... Less is more. Well, best of luck to both of you. - Thanks. - Thanks. They seem like nice people. Are you gonna miss the house? It's just a building. Home is where my family is. Back to the hotel? Yes. I'm ready for my massage now. (chuckles) All right. Condo, here we come. It's gonna be nice. Just the three of us. (barks) Honey? (gunshot)
