 Previously on Why Women Kill.. They pumped my stomach. I'm not paying for that. Not when a good burp would've saved you. I've known for some time about Karl's indiscretions. I was picking up my dry cleaning, and there was his car, parked across the street at some seedy motel. You still want to make love to me? - Yeah. - I'm free today at 4:00.

 Where should we go? You're a man now; figure it out. There's no way I'm getting into your mobile sex den. You seem, uh... energized. Do I? Have you embarked on a new exercise regimen? I plan on working out as often as I can. The other day, she was going on and on about how much she liked my movie. You know what? We've already got an open marriage... I'll ask her for a three-way. If she says no... She says yes. Oh, my God.

 You in love with her? You've been insecure lately - because of your career. - Are you in love with her? No. Has your married man ever told you why he feels the need to cheat? He was bored with his wife. It's a manual. For married couples. These are dirty pictures. They're scientific. I have to concentrate. Ow, ow, ow! Rob, please don't go. This has been an awkward night. I need to make an appearance. They must be important clients. Don't wait up. It begins quite slowly. With a look. Or a gesture. And once the invitation is accepted... The tango begins. It is a dance of anticipation. - Seduction. - Desire. And love. You know, some say it takes two to tango. But sometimes, lurking in the dark... Is a third. Now, if you choose to dance with him, be prepared to deal with the consequences. For passion can turn to jealousy. Love can become violent. Yes. The tango exists to remind us the greatest love stories... End in death. Just a reminder, I've got that project due tomorrow. So you'll be working late again? Afraid so. Sorry, honey. What are your big plans for the day? Oh, nothing interesting. Need to drop by the dry cleaners. After that, I'll go to the market for some shopping. And then I might have lunch with a new friend. This is your phone number. Oh, I thought you should have it, now that we're getting to be chums. This way, if you ever need someone to go with you to the movies... I can call you up. Got it. Now, I rent a room from a lovely couple. The wife's name is also Sheila. - Oh. - So, if you call and she answers... Then I'll ask for the other Sheila. Exactly. Busy this week? Uh, my schedule is pretty open, except for tonight. I have a date. With your married man? He finished some big project at work. To celebrate, he got us reservations at this really fancy night club. He's taking you out? In public? For the first time. It's like an actual boyfriend. Isn't that nice? What are you smiling about? Oh, the absurdity of it all. I'm having the best sex of my life in the back of a catering van. Well, maybe when Mr. Grove moves out, we could start doing this in your bed. Yes... So, about that... Karl may be staying in my home longer than we discussed. How much longer? A week? Longer. Two weeks? He won't be leaving until after my daughter's wedding. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's two months away. Well, I don't mind the van. No, that's-that's not the point. Simone, he cheated on you with men. Why would you let him stay for five more seconds? Well, I tried to throw him out. - And he wouldn't go? - He said that if I made him leave, he would tell all my friends he was gay and embarrass me before the wedding. So he's threatening you? No, it's just a little light blackmail. All right. I'll take care of this. What does that mean? Nothing. I'm just gonna convince him that he's making a mistake. That's adorable. Hey, I'm serious. Please, let me help. Absolutely not. I'm not gonna break any bones. I'm just gonna bend some stuff. Tommy, how do you expect our secret affair to remain secret once you've been arrested by the police for beating up my husband? I was just spitballing. Well, I appreciate the passion, but save it for the van. I'd still love to meet Karl alone in a dark alley some night. Careful. He might enjoy that. Yes. Um, no, I understand, it's just that I've been through the deposition twice and I couldn't find anything useful. Eli. Eli. - Oh, hey. - Yes. I will check again. Sure. What's that? Got it this morning. It's pretty sweet, right? Uh, don't you already have a guitar? Yeah, no, honey, this is a bass. Five strings, it sounds totally different. Check it out. - Very cool. - Yeah. - Oh, are you going to the kitchen? - Yeah. Could you grab me a soda? Sure. With the, the crushy ice? - Mm-hmm. - Love you. Hey. Hey. Did you hear the big news? Eli bought a bass. Oh, I heard. He thinks it's gonna help him work through his writer's block. Great. That's how he ended up with his other guitar, the Xbox and the elliptical. Got it. So, how was your day? Mm. It was crazy busy. I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch. Oh, God, you have to try this. Here. It's hot. Careful. Mmm. - That's amazing. - It's good, right? Yeah. So, did Eli get any work done today? I'm not sure. I was running errands. - Why don't you ask him? - No. If I ask Eli, "Did you get any writing done?" what he hears is, "nag, nag, nag, nag, nag." - Ah. - I'm just gonna say nothing and be supportive. This is my supportive smile. Tell me what you think. It's terrifying. Hey, I have an idea. After dinner, let's go dancing. - Tonight? - Yeah. There's this new club in Silver Lake I've been dying to check out. I have a lot of reading to do for work. Oh, come on. You've been so stressed, and I can't remember the last time we went dancing together. I could use some alone time, just you and me. - Really? - Mm-hmm. So we can go clubbing? - Clubbing? - Eli. Thought you were playing your bass. Thought you were grabbing me a soda. I was getting to it. So you guys are going clubbing, huh? Yeah. Yeah, we are. All right. I'm in. Eli, you don't dance. I dance. In my way. When you dance, you're in everyone's way. Oh... What? You guys really don't want me to come? No. No, no, no. We'd love for you to come. Right? Absolutely. Whoa. Creepy smile. Karl? There she is. Naomi. Did we have plans? No, I just popped in with a question. Karl said you went to the post office, and so I waited. For an hour. Yes. We need to talk about the entertainment for the benefit. Benefit. For the burn victims. Oh, my God. I forgot all about it. Simone, you're in charge of the decorations. It's fine. I ordered everything weeks ago. My mind's been elsewhere because of recent events. Are you still up for your number? Simone promised the two of you would reprise your dance. From the country club's talent show. Oh, did she? I'm not sure I'm up for it now, given recent events. Well, if you don't do something, Ida Ford is threatening to sing opera. Oh, darling. Haven't the burn victims suffered enough? All right. We'll perform. I'm so glad. And remember: if you ever need to talk about anything, I am always here. Yes. You certainly seem to be. Why did you let her inside? I'm the one who should be miffed. Why didn't you tell me Naomi saw my car at a motel? We're lucky that's all she saw. If she knew you were having anonymous sex with strange men... It was never anonymous. And only a few of them were strange. I am not the audience for that joke. - What are you doing? - Benefit's in two days. We need to rehearse. Ugh, what was I thinking? I can't dance with you, I'm still furious. You'll forget all about that when we're the center of attention, drowning in applause. Stop trying to charm your way back into my heart. It won't work. Now, you see, I think you've forgotten how much fun we have together. And I am determined to remind you. Why are you trying so hard to hold onto me? Because I love you, my darling. Well, I'm not sure that's enough. Well, try this on for size. I actually like you. How many of your husbands can say that? Oh, hey. Ooh, thanks. Oh, crap. What? What's wrong? I think I just saw my agent. Lamar's here? Why don't you go say hi? No, he's just gonna give me a hard time about finishing the script. There's an easy way to get him off your back. - What's that? - Finish your script. This kind of attitude is why I introduce you to people as my first wife. Yeah, that's funny. Is everything okay? Yeah. I just really want to dance with you right now. - Yeah, let's do it. - Okay. - Come on. - Jade! Oh, my God! Wischa! Oh, my God! Did she say "Wischa"? - I think so. - You guys. These are my friends, Willow and Mischa. Wischa. Ah, I get it. This is, uh, Taylor and Eli. How do you two know Jade? Oh... We met her last year. Oh, and it was love at first sight. Oh, my God, you guys! Girl, you look fucking amazing. Mmm, when fucking doesn't she? Fucking never. I'm getting the feeling that we weren't Jade's first threesome. Mm-hmm. I don't get it. Why would you want to start palling around with this tramp? Because I want to stop her from seeing my husband. And how is buying her popcorn at the Rialto gonna make that happen? I'm trying to establish trust. If a stranger came up and said your dress was ugly, what would you say? I'd say fuck off. But if a dear friend gently suggested orange is not your best color? I'd get rid of the dress. If I'm to convince April it's not in her best interest to date a married man, first I must become her confidant. Her close advisor. Okay. So when does this new friendship - begin to blossom? - Tonight. I thought Rob was taking her to the club tonight. Do you honestly think I'm going to let that happen? You all right? - No, I'm nervous. - Why? Everyone we know will be in this room tonight. You've dazzled them all a hundred times. Because I knew how much they envied me. They'd laugh in my face if they knew the truth about us. Here's a thought. Don't tell them. People will be able to figure it out. Do you honestly believe we're the only couple here pretending to be something that we're not? - No. - Trust me, there is not a woman here tonight who wouldn't trade all of her problems for yours if she looked half as beautiful as you do right now. But what good is other people's envy if it's all based on a lie? I'm not sure. Let's find out. Simone! You look stunning. And you look like a teenager. - How do you get your skin so soft? - Oh! It's called a chemical peel. I know. One more and she'll be the Phantom of the Opera. - Simone! - Darling. Hello, Barclay. Sandy, you're out of rehab. Don't worry, I'll be back. - Maybe I should go and find our table. - No need. I've arranged for us all to sit here. Together? What fun. I think this is a good time to find the bar. Liquor's on it's way, Simone, brought to you by the most adorable waiter at the party. Wine, Mrs. Grove? Tommy. You're our waiter? Yes, Mrs. Grove. Mr. Grove. Hello. Shall we, darling? So, Mischa, what do you guys do for a living? Oh, uh, we're influencers. Influencers? On Instagram. We're sort of famous. Are you? Yeah, it's called @UnderwearEverywhere. All these underwear brands pay us stupid money to post pictures wearing their stuff. At famous landmarks, like, all over the world. Yo, check it. Oh, wow. And the Taj Mahal people, they were okay with that? Ah, we were in and out lickety-split. We had the best time. We've missed you, little Jade. Oh, I missed you. So, um, how long are you guys here? We leave tomorrow night for Venice. - No. - Oh, so soon. Oh, that sucks. I was hoping I'd have more time to hang out with you guys. Yeah, it sucks. - Wait, Mischa. - What? I just had an idea. I know what you're thinking, and it's fucking brilliant. What are you thinking? Come with us to Venice tomorrow. - Oh, my God. - Tomorrow? Really? Yeah, it would be so much fun. Well... She doesn't have a plane ticket. Our assistant can take care of that. - You guys have an assistant? - Yeah. Guys, come on, it's such short notice. That'll cost a fortune. Oh, please, we've got tons of miles. - Really? - Yeah. Do you have a current passport? I think so, yeah. Oh, my God. Um, hold on. You can't just leave the country on a whim. It's irresponsible. Okay, Mom. Geez, calm down. Excuse me? Oh, my God! Oh... this song is my jam! Guys, let's dance. Come on. - Yeah, let's dance. - All right, let's do it. Come on. Let's go, bro. - Me? Yeah? - Yeah. - Let's do it. - All right. I'm going with him. So... Stanton speaking. Rob, it's me. Well, this is a nice surprise. I don't mean to bother, but I'm making tuna casserole for dinner. Do you prefer bread crumbs or not? Honey, I told you I'm working late tonight. Oh. Did I forget? Yeah, our deadline for the project is tomorrow morning. Right. What was the name of that again? The Delphi Project. Of course. Of course, well, I'll let you get back to work. Now, remember, don't wait up. I won't be home till the wee hours. Oh, poor baby. Well... Hello, Claire. Mrs. Stanton. Your husband didn't tell me you were gonna stop by. Oh, Rob isn't expecting me. This is something of a surprise. I am desperate for a cup of coffee. Could you be so kind? Well, I'm-I'm not supposed to leave my desk. Claire, how often do I ask you for favors? Sure, Mrs. Stanton. I'll be back in a jif. Don't rush, dear. Take your time. Hi there. Beth Ann. What are you doing here? I couldn't bear the thought of you getting your dinner from a vending machine. Wow, that's thoughtful. I know you have a kitchen around here somewhere. You can pop it in the fridge until you're ready to eat. Sure. Claire, can you come in here for a second? Claire? Ah, she must have wandered off. I'm sure she'll be back soon. Now, Robert, I went to all the trouble of making this casserole. I don't want the tuna to spoil. I will put it in the fridge. Mrs. Stanton, here's your coffee. Oh, you're so sweet. It's very hot. You might want to give it a moment - to cool off. - Oh, I don't have time to wait. I have things to do. Oh, it'll just take a sec. You're a treasure. Tell Rob I'll see him back home. Who said you could have a coffee break? I was so flattered. Usually when Tommy's company caters one of my events, he refuses to wait on me. But tonight, he asked for this table. Did he? The theme of this evening is "South of the Border." - Yes. - So, who chose the flamenco outfits for the waiters? I did. Why? Flamenco is Spanish. Isn't that what they speak down there? Spanish, as in Spain. Yes, but it still counts as south of the border. Yes, if the border is with France. Oh, do you see what I have to live with? Such a know-it-all. Yes, I'm forever flouting my knowledge that Spain is in Europe. Naomi, can I just say I'm stunned at how handsome your son's become. I'm stunned he can breathe in those pants. Karl... you're making Tommy uncomfortable. Me? I'm not the one who dressed him up as a backup dancer to Liza Minnelli. Another scotch, please, young man. Yes, Mr. Grove. Very good. Thank you. Hurry back, Tommy. Can you believe how she's flirting with my son? Oh, Sandy is just being playful. He's 18. She's 32. Don't you think that's pathetic? Excuse me. Vodka rocks, please. You have to switch tables. I can't. Then at least stop glaring at Karl. He's such a jerk. He's just trying to be funny. He's insulting your dignity. You can't say that in those sleeves. Ah, vodka rocks. Thank you. Mmm. You've found your calling. Hey! There you are. - Here I are. - Why aren't you dancing? I'm tired. - Are you about ready to go? - Now? - Yeah. - I'm having so much fun with Wischa. Well, it's after midnight, and I got to be up early and go to my job that requires me to, you know, wear clothes, so... How many of those have you had? A couple. Maybe two couples. You seem angry. I'm not angry. Unless you're going to Venice with those low-rent Kardashians. Hey. Taylor, be nice. Those are my friends. Yeah, and I'm just the person who saved you from an abusive relationship and let you live in my house, but fuck me, right? Okay. Um, I think maybe you should go home, and I will... - I'll see you later. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. Hey. Are you going to Venice? I don't know yet. Fine. Go! Have the best time. - Come on. - What? Now? - Yeah, now. - Okay. Stanton residence. Honey, thank God you're there. Rob. You sound upset. Listen, when you were in my office earlier, did you happen to move any papers? What are you talking about? The final draft of the Delphi Project. It was here on my desk and now it's gone. Did you look under your desk? Yes, I've looked everywhere. Now, this is incredibly important. Are you sure you didn't touch it? I know better than to touch your things. Damn it. If I don't find this thing, I'll have to stay late and redo it, the whole goddamn thing. I thought you were working late anyway. Uh... that was on something else. It doesn't matter. I have to go. I-I have to go. Yeah? Hi, I'd like to speak to Sheila. You're talking to her. Who's this? I think I mean your roommate, the other Sheila. Um, this is April from the diner. Oh, oh! Oh, uh, Jesus, all right, hold on. You-know-who is on the phone. She wants to talk to you. Hm. I thought she might. April? Hi. I know this is late notice, but would you like to come with me to the club tonight? Rob cancelled on me. I'm a mess right now, but I guess I could throw myself together. Oh, good. It's the White Diamond Bar in Burbank. I'll meet you there in an hour. I'll be there. - What's going on? - Show some respect, kids. You're in the presence of greatness. Careful, everybody. - These bowls are hot. - Ooh! Tortilla soup. You can't say this isn't "South of the Border." Given Simone's grasp of geography, I'm surprised we're not having clam chowder. By the way, have you all heard the latest news about Larry and Sue? What about them? They've separated. - No! - Are you really that surprised? They fought constantly. In my day, people stayed married and found a way to work things out. Well, that's not always possible. Simone's right. People can care deeply for one another, it doesn't always mean that they should stay married. You see, this is where I think commitment becomes essential. Everyone makes mistakes, but if love is there, then there's a path to redemption. Easy for you to say. You and Simone have the perfect marriage. Oh, hardly. There are days when Simone regrets marrying me. Am I right, my darling? - More than a few. - Yes, I imagine she dreams of stifling me with a pillow or casting me aside like an old shoe. Oh, honey, you know I'd never throw away a shoe. But you don't get rid of me that easily. You see, she gave me her hand in marriage. - Karl... - And I'm never going to let it go. Oh! Bloody hell! Tommy, how could you be so clumsy? Sorry, Mr. Grove. Let me get you some napkins. Clearly, he did that on purpose. No, he just wasn't paying attention. You know how teenagers are. Okay, sober person, here we go. Give me this. Stop. Hey. Eli, don't rush me. I'm not rushing you. There. You know what? I don't get it. What's that? What don't you get? I don't get what Jade sees in those people. - Wischa? - Yeah. They're fake as shit. Yes, they are. Okay, legs, pants. And you know what? Why would anyone want to see them in their underwear? Ugh. 'Cause they're not even that pretty. Do you think they're pretty? Only their bodies and their faces. And now Jade's going with them to Venice? - Mm-hmm. - Fuck her. What's funny? You. You're funny 'cause you're drunk and ridiculous, and that's a nice change of pace. From what? Well, usually you're the one taking care of me when I'm doing something stupid. - I do take care of you. - Yes, you do. - I take care of everybody. - Okay. Hey, don't feel bad in the morning, okay? Why would I feel bad? 'Cause you'll remember how rude you were to Jade. Don't worry, she'll forgive you. Mm, fuck you. And so will I. I am so happy you came. You look amazing. It was very kind for you to invite me. I never go to places like this. Well, if you hadn't come, I would've had to stay home, and where is the fun in that? It's a shame your fella couldn't make it. Yeah, he said he had to work late, but who knows? Married men who cheat also know how to lie. It must be frustrating. Never knowing if Rob is going to stand you up for his wife. It can be annoying, but it's a trade-off. So what do you get out of the deal? Freedom. See, I don't want to get married. So this is just a... casual fling? Yeah. Rob's wife will get him back when I'm done with him, good as new. And if he keeps working late, it's going to be in a couple of weeks. Oh, good. For you. I mean, good for you. Where is our waiter? So, April, why don't you want to get married? Because I want to have a career. Doing what? I want to be a singer. Really? That's kind of why I wanted to come here. They have girls that sing with the combo on the weekends, so I'm gonna introduce myself to the manager, and then I am going to audition for him. I had no idea you sang. I started in the church choir back at home. Folks there think I'm pretty talented. I'm gonna be somebody someday. You just watch. I love music. I used to play the piano. No kidding. Yeah, I took lessons for years. Well, do you still play? The truth is, my husband didn't care for my playing. I made the mistake of telling him I wanted to give a recital, and he just laughed. He said I wasn't as good as I thought I was. That sort of took the wind out of my sail. Oh, honey. Your husband's dead. Don't you think it's time you stopped listening to him? Can I just say I am very happy to be here tonight? Well, here's to us. Taylor, what are you doing? You were right. I have to go find Jade. It's 4:00 in the morning. I was such a bitch, and now she's going to Venice, and it's all my fault, and I have to fix this. All right, well, you don't even know where she is. Yes, I do, okay? I-I... She's at their hotel. - How do you know that? - I put Find My Friends on her phone. - You're tracking her? - I got to go. Oh, my God. Hey, what the fuck has gotten into you? I can't lose her. Well, you can wait until she gets home to talk to her. What if she doesn't come back? What if she's already on a plane to Venice and I never see her again? You just said she's at the hotel. I need her. If she leaves, this whole fucking thing falls apart. No... No. Stop the car. What does that mean? What whole thing falls apart? Eli, get off. No, you're gonna get out and you're gonna talk to me right now, Taylor. Really? Just talk to me, Taylor. What's going on? Come on. I asked you before if you were in love with her. I-I know, I know. - You lied to me. - Not exactly. Then what the hell are we doing in the driveway? Eli, come on, please. This is, this is too hard! - What? - I-I don't know. - What? - My life, my l... my life is so hard! I-I... The hours I work, the cases I take. And then I come home to this house. This big, fucking house that we can't afford! And I have to pay for it because you haven't sold a script in two years. But I can't bring that up because then I'm a bitch. So I say nothing. And Jade is the only thing in my life that is easy. 'Cause she doesn't take. She only gives. If she leaves, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Why didn't you tell me any of this before? Come on. I don't want to hurt you. Oh, well, great call. 'Cause it hurts. So, I mean... Do you want me to go? No. Eli, I love you. But you want her to stay. I mean... How does that even work? I don't know. I don't. But it has to. Because otherwise, it's just too hard to be married to me. No. Eli... I got fired. I'm not surprised. What you did was childish. - He was grabbing you. - He was holding my hand. - Why do you keep defending him? - I'm not. He's lied to you, he's cheated on you and he won't leave your home. The situation is complicated. Well, yeah, it must be, because it makes no sense. - You should hate him. - I know, I know, it's just... He's my husband. He puts up with my extravagance and my nonsense. He tells me I'm beautiful when I need to hear it the most and... he makes me laugh in a way that no one else can. Simone... One day, I will divorce Karl, but I will never hate him, because I can't. Where does that leave me? In the back of a van having a marvelous time. Yeah, well, van came with the job, so... Don't worry. We'll figure it out. Mrs. Grove. Mrs. Harte says it's time for your number. Thank you. I have to go. Hi. Hey. Listen, about tonight, I'm so sorry. - You don't have to apologize. - No, I do. I really do. Thank you. So, I decided to go to Venice with Mischa and Willow. Oh. It's time. Being here with you and Eli, it's... ...starting to feel like a home. I'm getting attached. Which always leads to me getting hurt. When it ends. So... I should go. What if it doesn't have to end? What if you stayed? What if this was your home? Here with us. What are you saying? Live with us. Be with us. Yeah. There's no reason to leave. You just got home. Hi. Oh, you're still up. Of course. Did you get your work finished? Yep. I redid the whole project. It took forever. I could fix you a snack if you like. No. I'm gonna make myself a martini, take a shower and go to bed. All right. Would it bother you if I played the piano for a bit? It's after midnight. I know. If you'd rather I didn't... Nah. Whatever you want. Honey, I need an olive for my martini. Check the fridge. - I can't find the olives. - Top shelf. I checked. They weren't there. Check again. Honey! It's not really a martini without an olive. Thanks. You know, it is so late. We should turn in.
