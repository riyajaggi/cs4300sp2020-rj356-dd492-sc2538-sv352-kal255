 BUT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE. Narrator: THE SUMMER DREDGING SEASON IS HALFWAY OVER, AND THE FLEET IS FEELING THE PINCH. 800 BUCKS A DAY TO 1,000 BUCKS A DAY JUST TO COME OUT HERE, YOU KNOW? AND, UH, IF YOU DON'T FIND GOLD, YOU'RE NOT GONNA -- YOU CAN'T SURVIVE. Narrator: MINERS HAVE SUNK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INTO THEIR RIGS JUST TO KEEP THEM UP AND RUNNING. 800 BUCKS WORTH FOR THEM TWO LITTLE DINK PARTS. DON'T DROP 'EM. GO MAKE SOME DAMN GOLD, THEN. SEE YA, DAD. Narrator: BUT THERE'S STILL TIME LEFT TO TURN A PROFIT. BOAT IS GOOD. THE SLUICE BOX IS GOOD. ALL WE NEED TO DO NOW IS JUST GET UP AND GET GOING. FINGERS CROSSED, MAYBE WE CAN FINISH THE SEASON OUT WITH A BANG. Narrator: NOW HITTING PAY DIRT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER... [ BABY CRYING ] ...ESPECIALLY IF YOU NEED MONEY FOR DIAPERS. YOU READY? I'M READY, BABE. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR DAYS. Narrator: IN THE CENTER OF NOME, BRAD KELLY GETS HIS FIRST CHANCE TO HOLD HIS DAUGHTER, THE GOLDEN CHILD, LITTLE BABY NIA. TRUST ME. I'LL HANDLE HER WITH KID GLOVES. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL. CAREFUL, CAREFUL. [ Baby voice ] ARE YOU LITTLE NIA? MY LITTLE BABY. [ Normal voice ] DAMN, SHE'S SO SMALL. SHE'D FIT UP A SUCTION HOSE. HEY, YOUR BROTHERS ARE A LITTLE ROUGH, BUT THEY'RE GONNA LOVE YOU. Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO... [ CRYING ] I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT, YOU KNOW? I REALLY DON'T. I'M REALLY UPSET OVER THIS [BLEEP]. Narrator: AFTER HEMORRHAGING BADLY DURING CHILDBIRTH, BRAD KELLY'S GIRLFRIEND COURTNEY WAS MEDEVACKED TO ANCHORAGE TO SAVE HER LIFE. I JUST WANT MY BABY AND MY GIRL TO BE HEALTHY. THAT'S ALL I GIVE A [BLEEP] ABOUT. COURTNEY, YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME, BABE. I WAS REALLY SCARED. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DYING. I WASN'T GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN. I THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE, AND I'M GONNA WORK THE HARDEST I'VE EVER WORKED TO KEEP GOLD FOR YOU AND THE BABY, OKAY? [ BABY FUSSES ] MY LITTLE PUMPKIN HEAD. YOU GET OLDER, YOU SEE THE JOY IN HAVING THIS LITTLE BABY. IT'S A GREAT LITTLE THING, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I GOTTA GET OUT THERE AND MAKE A LOT OF GOLD NOW. I WANT THIS BABY TO GO TO SCHOOL HERE. I WANT HER TO GO TO COLLEGE. [ Baby voice ] EDUCATION. YEAH. [ Normal voice ] OH, AND I KNOW HOW TO RAISE KIDS NOW. I LEARNED ALONG THE WAY. I MADE MISTAKES WITH MY BOYS. I'M NOT GONNA MAKE MISTAKES WITH THIS ONE. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, WHEN I HAD MY KIDS, I WAS YOUNG. I WAS 17 YEARS OLD. YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO RAISE A FAMILY. I WAS KINDA SHUNNED FROM MY FAMILY. NOW THAT I HAVE A NEW FAMILY, I KNOW A DIFFERENT PATH TO GO DOWN. NOW YOU'RE GONNA SEE A DIFFERENT BRAD. I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF MY BABY AT ANY COST. I THINK SHE'S HUNGRY AND WANTS A SECOND [BLEEP] OR SOMETHING. LOOK AT HER. [ SNIFFS ] NO, THAT WAS BAD. DADDY'S GONNA QUIT SWEARING, TOO. DADDY'S NOT GONNA USE NO MORE BAD WORDS. NOPE. Narrator: WHILE THE NEWEST KELLY SETTLES IN, OVER IN NOME HARBOR... GO AHEAD AND START PUSHING AWAY. Narrator: WITH 606 OUNCES, WORTH 727 GRAND COLLECTED ON THE SEASON, SHAWN POMRENKE AND THE 80-FOOT CHRISTINE ROSE ARE FIRING UP TO HEAD FOR THE TOMCOD CLAIM. I'M A VERY, VERY COMPETITIVE GUY. I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE. SO COMING IN FIRST IN THE GOLD COUNT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME. I DON'T LIKE TO BE BEAT. I DON'T LIKE ANYBODY BEATING ME AT ANYTHING. I LIKE BEING THE NUMBER ONE. THAT'S THE BOAT I WANNA BUY AT THE END OF THIS. MAYBE I'LL FIND THAT PILE OF GOLD TODAY, SO I CAN BUY MY BIG BOAT. [ HORN BLOWS ] THE CHRISTINE ROSE MIGHT BE LITTLE, BUT IT'S EFFICIENT, AND IT'S GOT ONE HELL OF AN OPERATOR. Narrator: SHAWN IS LESS THAN 400 OUNCES AWAY FROM BREAKING THE 1,000-OUNCE BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. YOU GET 1,000 OUNCES, I MEAN, PEOPLE RESPECT THAT. THAT SHOWS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND WE NEED TO GET 25, 30 OUNCES IN THE BOX TODAY, OR WE'RE GONNA FALL BEHIND. OH, [BLEEP]. THE ANCHOR JUST WENT OVER. HEY, JAKE... YOU GOT A 1,000-POUND ANCHOR HANGING OFF THE END OF IT. IF THAT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE BOTTOM, IT'S GONNA RIP THAT WHOLE WINCH AND EVERYTHING RIGHT OFF. Narrator: AS THE HALF-TON ANCHOR FELL OVERBOARD, IT RIPPED THE TRAILING STEEL BUOY ACROSS THE DECK INTO THE GUARD RAIL, NEARLY TEARING IT OFF THE BOAT. I'M GONNA FLIP THE BALL OUT OF THERE AND TRY GRABBING THAT ANCHOR. HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T SINK. Narrator: TO GET HIS ANCHOR BACK AND KEEP THE HULL INTACT, SHAWN NEEDS TO CAREFULLY RAISE THE LINE WITH HIS EXCAVATOR. HERE WE GO. I'M GONNA TRY IT. OH, OH. OH, MAYBE I CAN JUST FINESSE IT. OH, NO, IT MIGHT WANNA COME OFF THAT TOOTH. IT'S HANGING ON A THREAD. [ CLANK ] Narrator: THE BUCKET ARM IS AS HIGH AS IT CAN LIFT. NOW IT'S A MATTER OF GENTLY HOOKING THE ANCHOR BACK ON THE GUARD RAIL. NO! MORE? MORE. Narrator: WITH THE ANCHOR AND BUOY OVERBOARD, IT'S NOW A RACE TO ATTACH A CHAIN TO IT BEFORE THEY'RE LOST COMPLETELY. THINKING ON HIS FEET, SHAWN SECURES THE CHAIN TO THE MIDPOINT OF THE ANCHOR LINE, HOPING TO REDUCE THE DISTANCE THE BUCKET ARM NEEDS TO LIFT. GOT IT. JUST GOT THE CHAIN HOOKED UP. NOW I GOTTA GET THIS ONBOARD. WHOA! WE GOT EVERYTHING ONBOARD! Narrator: THE ANCHOR AND BUOY SAFELY SECURED ON DECK, IT'S NOW FULL SPEED AHEAD FOR THE DIGGING GROUNDS. YEAH, FORWARD, FORWARD. THAT WAS SCARY. KEEP PUSHING. DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THE GOLD. Narrator: 4 MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE ROCK WALL CLAIM... WE'RE ALL SYSTEMS GO. JUST GONNA LET THE ENGINE RUN FOR A WHILE, GET MY HOT WATER ALL WARMED UP. MY LEAST FAVORITE PART OF DREDGING IS PUTTING ON A COLD, WET WET SUIT. I REALLY HATE IT. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: DIVER ZEKE TENHOFF AND HIS GIRLFRIEND SARAH DUNN ARE PREPPING FOR ANOTHER DAY AT WORK. I WANNA FIND ONE OF THOSE REAL HOT SPOTS AND HOPEFULLY PUT A COUPLE OUNCES IN HERE TODAY. Narrator: 10 DAYS AGO... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY, BLEEP ] [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ZEKE BROUGHT ON HIS BABY BROTHER GABE AS A TENDER AND SECOND DIVER. 12 OUNCES. THAT'S NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL. Narrator: AND THE PAIR BROUGHT IN A $15,000 SCORE. NOW, AFTER LITTLE BRO HEADED HOME... HEY, OUR GENERATOR STOPPED WORKING, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. I THOUGHT IT WAS OUT OF GAS. WHAT'S THAT? Narrator: ZEKE IS ONCE AGAIN DIVING SOLO WITH A GREENHORN TENDER. ARE THERE ANY HOLES IN ANY OF THESE THINGS? THE BONES OF THE TENDERING JOB ARE NOT -- NOT VERY HARD. THERE'S NOT VERY MANY THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A GENIUS TO DO THAT STUFF. YOU NEED SOME HELP? [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] Sarah: HE'S JUST IN. NO GOODBYES OR ANYTHING. HE'S ANXIOUS. [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] THE CURRENT IS REALLY STRONG, AND IT'S SWINGING EVERYTHING AROUND. I JUST GOTTA MOVE THE ANCHOR. ARE YOU PULLING US? [ GRUNTS ] THIS IS -- THIS IS BOLD. OKAY. JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I LEFT OFF. I'M A LITTLE BIT DISORIENTED. OKAY, BUT YOU'RE NOT PUTTING ANY GOLD IN THE SLUICE BOX, THEN. I KNOW. I'M JUST ASKING. I'M JUST... I'M NOT ASKING IF YOU GOT A SECOND OUNCE OF GOLD ALREADY. I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT I'M JUST ASKING IF YOU ARE HITTING ANY GOLD. THAT WAS MY WAY OF ASKING YOU ARE YOU HITTING ANY GOLD WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE. NEVER MIND. ONE OF THE REASONS ZEKE GOT STUCK WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND TENDING IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW PEOPLE THAT YOU WANNA WORK WITH HERE. NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVEN GO ON A BOAT BECAUSE I WAS ON A BOAT TWICE BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE, AND EVERY TIME, I GOT REALLY SICK OUT ON THE BOAT. BUT I LOVE BEING HIS TENDER. IT CAN BE REALLY BORING, BUT, YOU KNOW, I-I LOVE STARING OFF INTO SPACE. [ LAUGHS ] [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] OH, YEAH, RIGHT HERE IS WHERE I LEFT OFF DREDGING. THIS IS SUPER HOT. OH, RIGHT OVER THERE, IT'S STARTING TO GET REALLY GOOD. [ SARAH SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] YEAH, THERE'S BEEN A BUNCH OF REALLY FINE GOLD IN THIS -- IN BETWEEN THESE ROCKS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE THESE BIGGER ROCKS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FINE GOLD IN THESE LITTLE CRACKS. YOU BETTER STOCK THAT GOLD UP LIKE YOU MEAN IT. IT'S KINDA GROUTED IN HERE, YOU KNOW? SQUEEZE, BABY. OH, IT'S JUST REALLY EASY STUFF. [ CLANK, WHIRRING STOPS ] SOMETHING JUST QUIT. HOLD UP. [ WHIRRING ] [ BLEEP ] [ BLEEP ] [ BLEEP ] OH, NO! WHAT THE [BLEEP] DO I DO?! Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ON THE CLARK... [ WHIRRING ] [ BLEEP ] [ BLEEP ] [ BLEEP ] OH, NO! WHAT THE [BLEEP] DO I DO?! Narrator: JUST MINUTES INTO ZEKE'S DIVE, THE TINY DREDGE BURSTS A FUEL LINE, LEAKING DIESEL ONTO A RED-HOT EXHAUST PIPE. HEY, WE GOT A -- WE GOT A GAS LEAK... OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT UP. [ WHIRRING ] OH, OKAY. [ ENGINE TURNS OFF ] [ HISSING ] CAN YOU JUST HOLD THIS THERE SO IT DOESN'T DRIP DOWN? AND I'LL UNSTRAP THESE -- YEAH, LIKE, IF I HOLD IT JUST RIGHT, IT DOESN'T COME OUT. OKAY. AND THEN... YEAH. OKAY. I REALLY DON'T MIND PUTTING MY HAND... I'M GONNA UNSTRAP THIS SO WE CAN TILT IT UP. I HAVE MY FUEL TANK RIGHT NEXT TO MY EXHAUST SYSTEM, SO THAT'S ALREADY KIND OF DICEY. IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD IDEA. UM... BUT I HAD, LIKE, EVERYTHING KINDA CLAMPED TOGETHER, SO EVERYTHING FIT TOGETHER JUST RIGHT. OH, MY GOD. COME HERE. I DON'T CARE IF IT HAS DIESEL ON IT. WIPE YOUR FACE. [ BLOWS NOSE ] OH, MY GOD. I'M SORRY. THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY. THERE'S DIESEL DRIPPING ALL OVER OUR PUMP, AND IT'S HOT AS [BLEEP]. Narrator: LUCKY FOR ZEKE... YOU CAUGHT THAT, LIKE, AT THE RIGHT TIME. Narrator: HIS GIRLFRIEND, THE GREENHORN TENDER, NOTICED THE LEAK IN TIME. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE BOTH THESE FUEL TANKS WOULD HAVE [BLEEP] EXPLODED, DUDE, AND EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN [BLEEP] [BLEEP]. RIGHT IN MY FACE. AND, LIKE, EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ON FIRE AND [BLEEP]. CRISIS AVERTED. Zeke: IT'S STARTING TO CLICK WITH SARAH A LITTLE BIT. SARAH'S GETTING BETTER AT, YOU KNOW, ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS THAT GO INTO, YOU KNOW, THE TENDERING JOB. Narrator: AFTER SHUTTING DOWN AND INSTALLING A NEW FUEL LINE, ZEKE CAN GET BACK AFTER THE GOLD. Sarah: GET YOUR ASS BACK DOWN THERE. Narrator: AS ZEKE RESUMES HIS DIVE, 5 MILES TO THE EAST... AND THE CENTER OF NOME... AT CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL'S GARAGE... Emily: THIS IS GONNA BE AN INTERESTING CLEANUP. THE BOYS WERE OUT. THEY WERE OUT IN SOME REALLY FANTASTIC GOLD. Narrator: THE SKIPPER AND HER CREW ARE CLEANING GOLD FROM A 4-DAY RUN. MY GOAL IS 400 OUNCES FOR THIS SUMMER SEASON. I'M HOPING FOR AT LEAST 20 OUNCES OUT OF THIS CLEANOUT, BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE'RE AVERAGING ABOUT A HALF AN OUNCE, A LITTLE BIT LESS BUT 20 OUNCES WOULD BE [BLEEP] FANTASTIC AT THIS POINT. DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH, BUT IT'S REALLY GOT A LOT OF WEIGHT FOR SOMETHING SO SMALL. Narrator: EMILY'S NOT THE ONLY ONE HOPING FOR A BIG PAYDAY. I NEED SOME MONEY...FOR SURE. Narrator: AFTER THREE MONTHS IN NOME, GREENHORN DIVER TONS RUPPE IS FEELING THE BURN. I CAME UP HERE WITH A SAVINGS -- PRETTY GOOD SIZE SAVINGS, AND MORE THAN I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD NEED, AND I UNDERESTIMATED IT JUST A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS A PAYCHECK FOR ALL THE BOYS, BUT FOR TONS ESPECIALLY. TONS IS PRETTY BAD OFF IN A FINANCIAL WAY. HE GETS PRETTY EXCITED AND ANXIOUS DURING CLEANOUTS. LIKE, I KNOW THAT THE GOLD IS BASICALLY HIS SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME RIGHT NOW, SO, YEAH, IT NEEDS TO WORK OUT FOR HIM. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE DAMAGE? IT'S 29.5 HOURS, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GOLD. THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH. TIME TO COOL. UNLIKE WITH EGGS, THIS GOLD DID NOT FLUFF WHEN HEATED. DON'T FLICK IT EVERYWHERE. THERE YOU GO. OH, WOW. Emily: 5 OUNCES. UGH. THAT'S TERRIBLE. I'M FLUMMOXED. I'M AT A LOSS, REALLY. I'M A TOTAL LOSS. Narrator: 4.9 OUNCES IS WORTH JUST 5,800 BUCKS. THAT'S TERRIBLE. UH, YEAH, NO. THAT, YOU KNOW, [BLEEP] SUCKS. LIKE, WHAT THE [BLEEP] AM I GONNA DO ABOUT IT, THOUGH? [ CLATTER ] I'M SORRY TO THROW A KNIFE AND, LIKE, POTENTIALLY HIT YOU, BUT... [BLEEP] THAT [BLEEP] SUCKS. [ CHUCKLES ] WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO [BLEEP] SAY ABOUT IT? CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO [BLEEP] CHANGE IT. OKAY. [ SCOFFS ] WHAT CAN I [BLEEP] DO? [ DRAWERS BANGING, CLATTERING ] Narrator: WHILE THINGS ARE LOOKING BLEAK FOR EMILY'S CREW, 7 MILES TO THE WEST... ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... [BLEEP] DAMN IT, ROCKY. Narrator: IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY FOR CAPTAIN HANK SCHIMSCHAT AND THE 80-FOOT AU GRABBER. IT'S MY SECRET HONEY HOLE RIGHT HERE. THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD. WE JUST GOTTA GET IT. Narrator: THIS SEASON, HANK IS STUCK LIKE GLUE TO A 2-ACRE AREA OF THE CLAIM JUST OFFSHORE OF AN ANCIENT CREEK BED. I DON'T KNOW WHY GOD MADE IT THAT WAY, BUT HE DID. HE PUT THE GOLD RIGHT UNDER ALL THESE BIG HARD [BLEEP] ROCKS. I MIGHT BE A SECOND-YEAR ROOKIE WITH MINING, BUT I KNOW DIRT. WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON RIGHT NOW, AND WE'RE AT 104 OUNCES FOR THE TOTAL FOR THE YEAR SO FAR. I'VE BEEN ON ONE SPOT ALL SUMMER, AND IT'S BEEN REAL GOOD FOR ME. I FOUND SOME REALLY GOOD GOLD IN FRONT OF A CREEK. YEAH, I GOT SOMETHING TO PROVE TO MYSELF -- PROVE TO MYSELF THAT I'D MADE THE RIGHT DECISION TO GO GOLD MINING. Narrator: AFTER DROPPING A MILLION BUCKS BUILDING HIS RIG, HANK NEEDS THIS HONEY HOLE TO HELP HIM OUT OF THE RED. OH, I'LL GET A COUPLE OF HUNDRED OUNCES OUT OF HERE IF I PLAY MY CARDS RIGHT. Narrator: BUT ON THE BERING SEA... ...NO SECRET HOT SPOT IS EVER REALLY SECRET. THAT'S THE CLOSEST IT'S EVER GOTTEN UP ON ME. Narrator: JUST 200 YARDS AWAY... GIVE ME SOME ROOM SO I CAN BREATHE! Narrator: LATE TO THE PARTY, AFTER BEING WAYLAID BY HIS ANCHOR LINE, IS HANK'S BIGGEST RIVAL, SHAWN POMRENKE, AND THE CHRISTINE ROSE. YEAH, AT SEA, WE'RE COMING BY HANK RIGHT HERE. THAT'S -- THAT'S A GOOD AREA. WHY LET THEM GET IT? I PULL UP NEXT TO HIM, START DIGGING. GIVE HIM A LITTLE TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE. Narrator: LAST SUMMER... Shawn: THERE AIN'T NO STINKING WAY. LOOKS LIKE HANK DECIDED TO MOVE RIGHT IN ON US. Narrator: HANK CHASED SHAWN AND THE CHRISTINE ROSE ALL OVER THE CLAIM. Shawn: HE'D END UP GETTING SHOT BACK IN THE OLD DAYS FOR IT. Narrator: TODAY... MR. GOLD IS RETURNING THE FAVOR. THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, I PAID ALMOST $2 MILLION TO MINE ON THAT CLAIM. DO I THINK I GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE RIGHT TO IT THAN HANK? DEFINITELY. I MEAN, I'VE PAID MY DUES. I'VE BEEN OUT THERE. I'VE DONE IT. SHAWN'S TRYING TO STEAL MY GOLD. HE'S RUNNING OUT OF GROUND OUT HERE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. SHAWN'S RUNNING OUT OF GROUND, THE GUY THAT OWNS IT -- HE'S LEASING IT. HE'S LETTING EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOTHER COME OUT HERE. COUPLE YEARS, THIS WILL ALL BE GONE. JUST MOVE ON. FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO DIG. WE'RE GONNA STOP AND TAKE A PAN. LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN DREDGED. IT'S JUST CLEAN-LOOKING. THERE'S A -- A LOT OF THE HEAVIES ARE GONE. Narrator: WITH OVER 2 DOZEN DREDGES WORKING THE CLAIM, SHAWN HAS TO FIND A RARE SPOT THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN PICKED OVER. Shawn: I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE MOVING DIRT THAT HAS A LOT OF GOLD IN IT, NOT JUST HALF OUNCE AN HOUR, A QUARTER OUNCE AN HOUR. WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN OUNCE AN HOUR-PLUS. I'M GONNA PAN AND PAN UNTIL I SEE WHAT I LIKE. Narrator: SHAWN MAY BE STRIKING OUT... LOOK AT THIS, MATT. RIGHT HERE. [ LAUGHS ] IS THAT A ROCK? Narrator: BUT HANK... NO. NO WAY. THAT'S A PIECE OF GOLD. NO WAY. THAT'S A FREAKIN' BIG PIECE OF GOLD, BOSS. THAT'S NOT GOLD. THAT'S GOLD. OH, BUT IT'S TOO DIRTY. Narrator: ...IS KNOCKING IT OUT OF THE PARK. THAT'S GOLD? I'VE NEVER SEEN NOTHING LIKE THAT. YOU GOTTA BE [BLEEP] ME. THAT'S GOLD? THAT'S GOLD. THAT'S GOLD?! I'M TELLING YOU THAT'S... THE NUGGET GOT THIS PAID OFF! LET'S GO LOOK AT THAT -- I WANNA LOOK AT THAT NUGGET IN THE LIGHT. THAT IS GOLD. HOLY [BLEEP]. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. HUH? THAT'S A CHUNK OF GOLD. WHOO-HOO-HOO! I WONDER HOW MUCH IT WEIGHS. COUPLE OUNCES. I'D SAY. MAYBE MORE? DIRTY. WOW. THAT'S A NICE CHUNK. Narrator: WITH A $7,000 NUGGET IN THE PAN, HANK IS ITCHING TO GET BACK TO WORK. Hank: I'M JUST GONNA KEEP FILLING MY BOX. THAT'S GOOD GROUND THERE, MAYBE. [ RATTLING ] WE'RE IN THE GOLD! I LOVE IT! I DEFINITELY GOT MORE GOLD THAN SHAWN TODAY. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT. [ LAUGHS ] BEAUTIFUL DAY. [ CLANK ] OH, [BLEEP]. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] [ POWERS DOWN ] Narrator: DIGGING THROUGH THE ROCKS AND BOULDERS BLEW A HYDRAULIC HOSE POWERING THE EXCAVATOR ARM. GOD DANG IT. GOLD GODS ARE PISSED OFF AS US. WE SHUT THE HOE OFF, AND EVERYTHING KIND OF STOPPED. Narrator: IN GOLD MINING... THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO TOWN AND GO GET A HOSE. Narrator: ...WHATEVER CAN GO WRONG WILL GO WRONG. WE GOT A BREAK. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... THERE'S TIME LOST. I'M JUST -- I'M JUST A LITTLE FED UP WITH, UH, YOU KNOW, GETTING -- GETTING THE [BLEEP] BIG SHAFT ON THE -- ON THIS END, YOU KNOW? Narrator: AFTER BLOWING A HYDRAULIC LINE TO HIS EXCAVATOR, CAPTAIN HANK SCHIMSCHAT IS BEING FORCED TO ABANDON HIS HONEY HOLE. MY TIME IS SHORT, SO I JUST -- RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA GO TO TOWN. I'M GONNA FIX WHAT I NEED TO FIX. I'M GONNA GET OUT HERE. I'M GONNA MINE, SO THAT'S WHERE I STAND. Narrator: MAKING MATTERS WORSE... HOW'S IT GOING OVER THERE, HANK? GOLD GODS ARE PISSED OFF. Narrator: HE'S LEAVING THE SPOT WIDE OPEN FOR THE CHRISTINE ROSE. [ RADIO STATIC CRACKLING ] YEAH. 10-4. TELL YOU, THE LAST TWO WEEKS WERE PRETTY GOOD RIGHT IN THIS LITTLE SPOT. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT -- WE GOTTA -- I GUESS WE GOTTA SAY GOODBYE NOW. OKAY, THANKS. I APPRECIATE THAT. Narrator: AND AS THE OLD SAYING GOES... HE SAYS HE ON GOOD GROUND. WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT HE'S REALLY ON. Narrator: WHILE THE CAT'S AWAY, MR. GOLD'S GONNA TAKE YOUR GOLD. HANK'S GOT A LOT TO LEARN. HE AIN'T GONNA COME OUT HERE AFTER ONLY MINING FOR TWO YEARS AND THINK YOU'RE GONNA BEAT ME. HE'S GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING UP. YOU READY BACK THERE? DO YOU WANT ME TO START TRYING? YEAH, USUALLY I'LL DRIVE TO GET US SET IN THE PLACE. NAIL HER DOWN. COOL HER OFF. SHUT HER DOWN. Narrator: SHAWN CHECKS OUT THE GROUND HANK WAS ON JUST MINUTES AGO. GO AHEAD. GRAB THE PANNING TUB AND, UH, PAN. MAYBE HE FOUND A HOT SPOT. YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU AIN'T OUT HERE, YOU AIN'T GONNA GET NO GOLD. IN PIECES RIGHT THERE. WHOA. THERE WE GO. I CAN SEE 20, 30 PIECES RIGHT HERE IN THIS AREA. OH, IT'S LOADED. WHOO! YEAH! WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME MONEY. THAT'S GONNA MAKE THAT BOX LIGHT RIGHT UP. WE BETTER GET SET UP AND NOT WASTE ANY OF THIS GROUND. I'M MARKING THAT ONE "MR. GOLD." I THINK WE JUST KNOCKED IT RIGHT OUT OF THE PARK. [ LOUD RATTLING ] [ Loudly ] THAT'S THE SOUND OF MONEY, BABY! MUSIC TO MY EARS. [ CLICKS TEETH ] WHOO! MR. GOLD DOING IT, AND HE'S DOING IT BIG. I CAN'T WALK OR CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME, BUT I CAN GOLD MINE LIKE A MOTHER[BLEEP]. BY THE TIME HANK FIGURES IT OUT, I'LL HAVE ALL THE GOLD. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN IS PACKING THE SLUICE BOX WITH GOLD... IN THE CENTER OF NOME... SO I'VE HEARD YOU'RE QUITTING? YEAH, I GUESS SO. LEAVING TOMORROW. Narrator: DEAD BROKE AFTER ANOTHER BAD CLEANUP, EMILY'S GREENHORN IS PACKING HIS BAGS. OKAY. 'CAUSE I'M NOT LIKE -- I'M NOT, LIKE, QUITTING LIKE I'M DONE WITH -- BUT I MEAN-- YOU'RE NOT, LIKE, QUITTING, LIKE WHAT? WHAT? LEAVING TOMORROW ISN'T QUITTING? NO, I JUST MEAN, I'M NOT TRYING TO BE LIKE THAT, THOUGH. 'CAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD BOSS. TRYING TO BE LIKE WHAT? WHAT, BUYING A TICKET AND GIVING ME 24-HOUR NOTICE? LIKE... WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? THERE'S NOTHING TO -- THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU TO SAY. THAT'S RIGHT. EXACTLY. WELL, I WANT YOU OUT OF MY HOUSE, AND YOU'LL GET PAID WHEN YOU GET PAID. I GET IT 100%. YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE MAD. AND I-I'M SORRY. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE LEAVING MID-SEASON. I-I KNOW. THAT DOESN'T DO [BLEEP] FOR ME. YOUR GUILT, YOUR APOL-- I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR APOLOGY! THEY DON'T MEAN [BLEEP] TO ME. I DON'T CARE! I DON'T EVEN WANNA LOOK AT YOU. GET OUT! GET OUT. YOU'LL GET PAID. NO, I'M NOT DOING -- I'M NOT DOING THAT. YOU'LL GET PAID. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU WON'T [BLEEP] GET OUT, I'M GONNA GO [BLEEP] WORK ON THE BOAT... I DIDN'T SAY I'M NOT DOING THAT, BUT I THINK ANY ONE THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU'RE GONNA KICK ME OUT OF THE HOUSE... YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'LL GET PAID WHEN WE DIVIDE THE GOLD. AND YOU KNOW -- LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW. DIVIDE IT RIGHT NOW. NO, NO. NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY? WHY? BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T WANT ME TO GET MY MONEY... NO. ...FOR SOME REASON. NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS. WELL, LET'S DO IT THEN. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS. THEN WHAT IS IT? I, UNLIKE YOU, COMMIT TO PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY DESERVE. I -- YOU'LL GET PAID BEFORE YOU LEAVE, BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M GONNA GO WORK ON MY [BLEEP] BOAT. YOU [BLEEP] MY OPERATION BY LEAVING. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING, AND YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT, DON'T YOU? BECAUSE I'M GOING HOME. YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT, DON'T YOU? NO, NO, I DON'T. KEEP ON FEELING GOOD. [BLEEP] I MEAN, I FEEL BAD APOLOGIZING. HAVE FUN IN LIFE FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT. I APOLOGIZED. THAT'S WHY I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT, EMILY. [ SCOFFS ] TO ME, TONS IS JUST ANOTHER BAD INVESTMENT IN CHARACTER, [ SIGHS ] TONS CLEANED THE BOAT. I MEAN, HE'S NOT REALLY THAT GOOD OF A GOLD MINER, SO [BLEEP] IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU LOSE SOME AND YOU WIN SOME. I LET HIM GO. HE'S GONE. MOVING ON. Narrator: AS ANOTHER DAY ARRIVES IN NOME... [ DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE ] [ BABY CRYING ] AT THE KELLY HOUSE... HEY, SOCKS. IT'S OUT WITH THE OLD... I JUST WANNA GET MY [BLEEP] AND GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. Narrator: ...AND IN THE WITH THE NEW. LOOK AT HER. OH, SHE GIVES ME THE SIGNAL. SEE, THAT'S THE SIGN. "GIVE ME SOME FOOD." YOU WANT SOME FOOD? [ Baby voice ] "YES, I REALLY WANT SOME FOOD." Kris: THIS IS REALLY NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH, LET ME TELL YOU. Narrator: TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE NEW BABY, KRIS HAS BEEN KICKED OUT OF HIS DAD'S HOUSE. Kris: AS SOON AS I MOVE OUT, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE AWESOME. I'LL BE HAPPIER. EVERYTHING'S BEEN A LOT BETTER SINCE MY BROTHER CAME BACK, ANYWAYS. YOU WANT KRIS TO BABYSIT YOU? YOUR BIG BROTHER KRIS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GONNA PROBABLY GO STAY OVER AT DAN'S HOUSE. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS HATE TO BE KICKED OUT. I PREFER TO LEAVE. WE'VE HELPED DAD OUR WHOLE LIVES, AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT US. NO, I KNOW. I'M SICK OF IT, TOO. LAST BAG. GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. WON'T BE BACK FOR A LONG TIME. THE JOKE OF IT IS I GOTTA COME BACK HERE TO DO MY [BLEEP] CLEANUPS, AND WE GOTTA PRETEND LIKE WE'RE STILL FRIENDS. [ TRUCK DOOR CLOSES ] SEE YOU LATER. HOPEFULLY ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS. Narrator: WHILE KRIS LOOKS FOR A NEW PLACE TO CRASH, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOME... AT ZEKE TENHOFF'S COMPOUND... LET ME SEE. OH, YEAH, DUDE. THAT'S BANGIN'. SEE, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL LOADED WITH GOLD. Narrator: THANKS TO THE VIGILANCE OF HIS SWEETHEART, ZEKE IS TALLYING UP HIS GOLD. [ CHUCKLES ] I'M THINKING THAT'S GONNA BE AT LEAST 7, 8 OUNCES. COOK IT UP. LET'S GO WEIGH IT. Sarah: OKAY. 2.2... OKAY, 3.8, 4.8... OH, OH, 6.1. 6.3, 6.4., 5, 6, 7. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. 10.4 OUNCES. I'M HAPPY. [ BOTH LAUGH ] ALL RIGHT. Narrator: 10.4 OUNCES -- THAT'S WORTH 12 1/2 THOUSAND DOLLARS. DUDE, THAT'S [BLEEP] GOOD. WE, LIKE, GOT THAT MONEY IN THE OCEAN. THAT'S WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THIS TO ME. YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T COME FROM SOME MAGIC MONEY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WRITE YOU A CHECK. IT'S LIKE WE ACTUALLY, LIKE, GOT THIS MONEY FROM UNDER ROCKS WITH OUR LABOR, AND IT'S RIGHT HERE. Narrator: BACK IN THE HARBOR... AH, YOU GOTTA REMEMBER THE SWITCH IN THE BACK THAT TURNS EVERYTHING ON, AND THERE'S ANOTHER SWITCH ON THE BURNER BEHIND THE SEAT THAT'S GOTTA BE ON. Narrator: AFTER REPLACING THE HYDRAULIC HOSE TO THE EXCAVATOR ARM, HANK IS SENDING DECK HANDS MATT PECKENPAUGH AND STAN MILLER BACK OUT TO THE DIGGING GROUNDS. I GOTTA GET SOME GOLD IN THE POT, AND MATT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO WHERE I CAN TRUST HIM TO RUN THE BOAT. Narrator: AFTER BEING FORCED OFF HIS HOT SPOT, HANK IS ANXIOUS TO RECLAIM HIS TURF. THIS IS ACTUALLY MY FIRST TIME SOLO OUT OF THE HARBOR. I'M GONNA GIVE TOMCOD ANOTHER TRY, I GUESS. MATT AND I WORK REALLY WELL TOGETHER, SO... I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GOOD HERE. BEING CAPTAIN MAKES YOU A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET OUT HERE AND WE'LL GET SOME MINING DONE AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL PUT SOME GOLD IN THE BOX. [ CLANK ] WHOA! WHAT HAPPENED? I LOST ALL THRUST. Narrator: WITHOUT WARNING, THE DREDGE HAS STALLED ON THE OPEN SEA. MATT! YOU WANNA PULL IT UP AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT? SEEMED TO HAVE LOST OUR THRUST. THE PROPELLER'S NOT SPINNING. LET ME SEE WHAT HE NEEDS. [ CLICK ] STEERING ALL THE WAY AT ONE SIDE RIGHT NOW? IS THAT HOW YOU HAVE IT? THAT'S IT. Narrator: WITH NO STEERING OR PROPULSION, THE BARGE IS HELPLESSLY ADRIFT. UH, WE'VE LOST STEERING ON THE THRUST MASTER, SO I'M GONNA PADDLE IT OVER A LITTLE CLOSER TO SHORE, PUT THE SPUD DOWN. [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] HEY, WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. UH, WE HAVE NO THRUSTER RIGHT -- WE HAVE NO THRUSTER RIGHT NOW. WE'RE -- WE'RE DEAD IN THE WATER. WE DON'T KNOW. WE WERE JUST ABOUT AT THE CLAIM, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, UH, WE STOPPED MOVING AND WE STARTED DRIFTING OUT TOWARD RUSSIA. IT'S GETTING PRETTY NASTY OUT HERE. THE WIND'S REALLY PICKED UP, AND WE'RE JUST GETTING BLOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE HERE. Narrator: IN THE CENTER OF TOWN... TONS, IN MY OPINION, YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS. I ALMOST DOCKED YOU HALF AN OUNCE. YOU'RE COSTING THEM MONEY, 'CAUSE IF WE WENT OUT AND MINED AND WE WERE IN A GOOD SPOT, WE ONLY HAVE TWO DIVERS, AND WITHOUT ANOTHER SHIFT, WE'RE LOSING MONEY. I ALMOST TOOK THAT GOLD AWAY FROM YOU, BUT I DIDN'T DO IT, EVEN THOUGH I REALLY FEEL LIKE I SHOULD. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S NO HONOR IN THIS. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GET OUT OF MY HOUSE. THAT'S IT. ALL RIGHT. [ DOOR CLOSES ] Tons: I DO FEEL BAD, UH, FOR -- FOR LEAVING, BUT I'VE GOTTA LOOK OUT FOR ME, AND NO ONE'S GONNA DO IT FOR ME. SO I MEAN, I GOT TO A LINE, AND I JUST DON'T WANNA -- I JUST DON'T HAVE IT IN ME ANYMORE. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... BECAUSE RIGHT NOW HE CAN'T REACH BOTTOM, SO WE CAN'T HOLD OURSELVES IN ONE SPOT. Narrator: WITH THE WEATHER WORSENING, THE 80-FOOT GOLD GRABBER HAS LOST STEERING AND PROPULSION AND IS NOW ADRIFT ON THE BERING SEA. THIS IS A HUGE BARGE, AND IT'S LIKE A BIG SAIL, AND IT'S TAKING US WHERE WE DON'T WANNA GO RIGHT NOW, SO HOPEFULLY, WE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. IT COULD BE A LITTLE SCARY HERE IN A LITTLE BIT. OKAY. Narrator: AFTER PADDLING TO SHALLOW WATER... THE CREW LOWERS STABILIZING SPUD TO KEEP FROM DRIFTING. [ CREAKING AND CLANKING ] THE SPUD DOWN AND THE BARGE LOCKED IN PLACE... HELP ME PULL IT FORWARD, STAN. Narrator: THE SKIPPER ARRIVES TO HELP DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. STEERING AND THRUST. SAME TIME. YEAH, IT'S GETTING [BLEEP]. IT'S BUILDING QUICKLY. SO WE NEED TO GET A SCREWDRIVER TO TAKE 'EM OFF, CLEAN 'EM OFF, PUT SOME GREASE ON 'EM. FIND OUT THE PROBLEM ONE AT A TIME HERE. I'M GONNA GET A SCREWDRIVER TO PULL THIS OFF, AND I THINK IT'S DOWN THERE. OH, YEAH. BUT I MEAN, WE GOT -- WE GOT PROBLEMS. I MEAN, I DON'T... WELL, YOUR SWITCH IS OFF. YEAH, THE SWITCH IS OFF. SEE, THAT NEEDLE JUMPED FROM ONE POINT. SEE, WE GOT A PROBLEM. SO IT'S ONLY ONE THING. IT'S THE STEERING. Narrator: THE PROPELLER STILL HAS POWER, BUT STEERING IS A NO-GO. WE NEED TO SPIN THIS MOTOR AROUND MANUALLY, AND THEN, UH, AND THEN LOG IT IN. Narrator: TO GET OUT OF DANGER, HANK NEEDS TO LOCK THE PROPELLER IN PLACE AND STEER THE BARGE WITH THE EXCAVATOR. [ CLANKING ] WHEW, GOT THE MOTOR CHAINED DOWN ON EACH SIDE SO IT CAN'T SPIN ON ITS OWN. Narrator: FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 24 HOURS, HANK IS FORCED TO HEAD BACK IN FOR REPAIRS. AT THIS POINT, REALLY, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. THE GOLD GODS HAVE BEEN PISSED OFF AT ME ALL YEAR. EVERYTHING'S WORKING FINE, THE GOLD'S GREAT, AND THEN IT'S LIKE WHY? WE GOT IT TO WHERE WE CAN TRAVEL, AND THAT'S THE MAIN PART RIGHT NOW, SO... READY TO ROLL? [ WHIRRING ] WE'RE PULLING THE SPUD. WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THIS WEATHER. [ CLANK ] WE PROBABLY MADE A BAD CHOICE TRYING TO COME OUT AND MINE. THERE'S NO SENSE IN TRYING TO COME OUT MINING IF THIS KIND OF STUFF [BLEEP] HAPPENS TO BREAK. JUST WANNA GET BACK HOME, GET SOME THINGS FIXED, AND GO OUT AND MINE GOLD. Narrator: WHILE HANK IS OUT OF LUCK AGAIN, BACK IN NOME, AT THE POMRENKE CLEANUP SHACK... WE'RE KICKING ASS. Narrator: SHAWN HAS HIT THE JACKPOT ON HANK'S OLD SPOT. KINDA FEEL BAD FOR HANK, BUT NOT REALLY. YOU WANT PILES OF GOLD LIKE THIS, YOU GOTTA ACTUALLY WORK FOR IT. Narrator: TO HELP HIM RUN THE MATERIAL... GOOD MORNING. HEY, DAD. WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON. YEAH. Narrator: HE'S EVEN CALLED IN THE OLD MAN. GONNA BE 50 OUNCES IN THAT HEADER? OH, YEAH. I'M THINKING FOR 50. DAD AND I HAVE MINED HERE FOR 25 YEARS, SO WHEN GOLD MINING COMES TO ANYBODY'S MIND, THE POMRENKES FOLLOWS THAT RIGHT ALONG WITH IT. I'VE PAVED THE WAY FOR HANK AND ALL THE REST OF THESE GUYS THAT ARE FOLLOWING MY LEAD. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE CONTEST ON WHOEVER GETS CLOSEST ON HOW MUCH THE CLEANUP IS, FOR THE BIGGEST NUGGET ON THE DREDGE. OH, GOOD. THAT'S A GOOD CONTEST. OH, THIS IS LIKE [BLEEP] "PRICE IS RIGHT" NOW, IS IT? OOH, THAT'S A GOOD PILE OF GOLD. NOW WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND ROLL THIS STUFF UP, GET IT OUT OF HERE, PUT IT IN THE NEW WHEEL. THIS IS WHERE YOU GET TO SEE THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT SOME GOLD. [ BUCKET CLATTERS ] OOH. OH, LOOK AT THAT. NOT LOOKING TOO SHABBY. AIN'T GONNA MAKE ANY GUESSES JUST QUITE YET. THOSE GUYS ARE STILL PANNING THE COARSE OFF. Narrator: TOO BUSY PANNING. Shawn: I'M WAITING. Narrator: STEVE AND JESSE MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE HANK DID. NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON MR. GOLD. I WAS JUST -- I WAS -- I WAS JUST TESTING IT, TRYING TO GET AN IDEA WHERE I WAS AT. I'M DONE. THE BIGGEST NUGGET... WHAT? WHAT'S THE -- WHAT'S THE GUESS? YOU READY? JESSE, WHAT'S YOUR GUESS? I'M -- I'M LOOKING HERE. 46... 42.5. I'M GONNA SAY 44. THIS IS ANYBODY'S GAME. I'LL WEIGH IT UP. 30, 34. [ TAPPING ] 42, 43... Jesse: DAMN IT. YEAH, BUT THE FUNNELS ON THERE YET. MAN. YEAH. WATCH THIS. THAT ONE'S GONNA BE RIGHT ON. 32, 34, 5, 6, 7. OH, OH, 42...43... 44.8. AH! HA HA! I GOT IT. [ LAUGHING ] YOU SNEAKY... YOU WEIGHED IT BEFORE, YOU SNEAKY BASTARD. YEAH! [ LAUGHING ] YOU WEIGHED IT BEFORE. YOU CHEATED. Narrator: 44.8 OUNCES IS WORTH ALMOST $54,000... NOW YOU GOT A BONUS. Narrator: ...MINUS, OF COURSE, ONE ILL-GOTTEN NUGGET. AH. THAT -- GIVE ME THAT THING. [ LAUGHING ] YOU GOTTA GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING TO BEAT MR. GOLD. Narrator: WHILE ANOTHER 10 OUNCES HAS ZEKE GAINING GROUND, EMILY RIEDEL IS LOSING CREW. FULL SPEED AHEAD! FIRE AWAY. LOSE 'EM, JACOB! [ GROANS ] I'M COMING TO GET YOUR FAT ASS, ZEKE! [BLEEP] THAT'S SOME OF THE BEST GOLD I'VE EVER SEEN, BUDDY. [ SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] THERE IT GOES! [ CRASH ]
