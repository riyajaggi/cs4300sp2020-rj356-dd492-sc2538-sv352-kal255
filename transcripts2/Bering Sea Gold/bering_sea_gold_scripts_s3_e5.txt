WORKING WITH GLEN RIGHT NOW, IT'S LIKE, THE GUY JUST TAKES ANY OPPORTUNITY HE CAN TO BELITTLE ME AND WHAT I DO. Glen: ZEKE MAY OR MAY NOT REALIZE THE FACT THAT HE'S WORKING WITH ME IS GONNA ALLOW HIM TO JUMP, LIKE, YEARS IN ADVANCE. I KNOW THAT I OUTRANK ZEKE, AND I'VE KNOWN THAT FROM THE BEGINNING. NOT EVERYONE THAT'S ON THE NOZZLE

 CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: NOME, ALASKA. WE'RE MEDICATED AND HIGHLY MOTIVATED. WE'RE GETTING SOME GOLD TODAY! Emily: PEOPLE COME UP HERE, AND... THEY'RE SICK. THEY'RE SICK. THEY HAVE GOLD FEVER. WHOO-HOO. Narrator: FOUR WEEKS INTO THE WINTER MINING SEASON, GOLD FEVER IS ON THE RISE. JUST HOPE IT KEEPS COMING. [BLEEP] YEAH. I'M GONNA GET THE GOLD. SCREW EVERYBODY ELSE. Narrator: WITH THE CLOCK TICKING... TIME, MONEY. EVERY MOVE IS TIME AND MONEY. ...THE RACE IS ON TO CASH IN... Andy: IT'S AMAZING HOW MONEY MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD. IT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD. Narrator: ...AND LEAVE THE COMPETITION OUT IN THE COLD. THE WAR'S GONNA GET STARTED. GRAB YOUR PIPES. GET YOUR [BLEEP] BATS READY. THAT I.R.A.'s MOVING IN. Andy: LET'S DO IT! [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... ...ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... EVERYTHING'S MOVING AND JUST ABOUT READY TO GO. THEY'RE PUTTING THE FINAL TOUCHES. THE EDGE OF OUR "O" CUT IS PROBABLY ABOUT 30 FEET FROM HERE. SOME OF THE BEST GOLD SEEN. Narrator: LEADING THE PACK IN THE GOLD COUNTS -- WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON, WITH OVER 100 OUNCES, WORTH 130 GRAND. WE'RE GETTING READY TO FIRE IT BACK UP AND START MAKING SOME MONEY AGAIN. WE GOOD TO GO? Man: GOOD TO GO. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: SET UP ON A FRESH DIVE HOLE, VERNON IS ON TRACK FOR A 200-OUNCE SEASON. Vernon: YEAH, THIS IS LOOKING REAL DAMN GOOD TO ME. A LOT BETTER AROUND HERE SINCE JASON'S NOT HERE. A LOT BETTER. Narrator: BUT TO GET THERE, HE'LL NEED A NEW LEAD DIVER. I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ANYBODY BITCH, PISS, MOAN, COMPLAIN. IT WAS MISERABLE DEALING WITH THAT GUY. Narrator: SO FAR... THAT'S LOOKING VERY JUICY. THAT FEELS GREAT! Narrator: ...VERNON'S CHARGE TO THE TOP OF THE LEADER BOARD HAS BEEN LED BY ONE MAN... YOU PISS OFF EVERYBODY IN THIS [BLEEP] CREW WITH YOUR NEGATIVE [BLEEP] ...RECENTLY FIRED CREW CHIEF JASON WALKER. NOBODY CAN TAKE AWAY WHAT I DID. OH, YEAH, YOU'RE THE GREATEST, JASON. YOU'RE THE GREATEST. NOBODY. Vernon: ESSENTIALLY, JASON PUT ME ON THE GOLD. I GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE. HE WORKED THERE ALL SUMMER. HE KNEW THAT AREA LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HAND. SO, NOW I HAVE TO GO AND FIND SOMEBODY ELSE TO FILL THAT SLOT. YEAH, I WEAR THIS RIGHT HERE SO I DON'T TEAR UP MY WET SUIT. Narrator: TRYING TO FILL JASON'S SHOES IS AN UNTESTED ROOKIE MINER, 28-YEAR-OLD KENTUCKY BOY JUSTON COOK. I'VE BEEN DOING COMMERCIAL DIVING FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS. I GOT A DAUGHTER THAT'S 5 YEARS OLD. I REALLY MISS HER, SO I'M READY TO GET HOME AND JUST SHOW HER THE GOLD THAT I'VE BEEN FINDING. IT'S SO MUCH BETTER TENDING FOR JUSTON, 'CAUSE HE'S NOT A LITTLE BITCH, AND I DON'T HATE HIM. [ LAUGHS ] I'M GLAD I'M NOT A LITTLE BITCH. [ LAUGHS ] KNOWING JASON'S GONE AND I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY HERE -- IT'S JUST GONNA DRIVE ME TO NO END. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT THERE NOW AND JUST KNOCK OUT A LOT MORE WORK AND JUST BUST MY ASS THAT MUCH HARDER. JUSTON IS A COMMERCIAL DIVER. HE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. WE'LL LET HIM GO IN THERE AND SEE HOW HE DOES. Juston: LET'S GO MAKE SOME MONEY! Juston: HEY, TOPSIDE, YOU GOT ME? Elaine: YEAH, WHAT'S UP? Vernon: I'D LIKE FOR JUSTON TO JUST BEAT JASON'S PANTS OFF IN GOLD RECOVERY. PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE. Narrator: WITH THE SPRING MELT JUST AROUND THE CORNER, VERNON CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS A STEP. Vernon: MY GOAL IS 200 OUNCES FOR THE WILD RANGER FOR THE SEASON. I'D HATE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M GONNA DO IF THIS DOESN'T WORK. I'VE PRETTY MUCH GOT ALL MY EGGS IN THIS BASKET. SO, ALTOGETHER, HE'S MY KEY MAN RIGHT NOW. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GONNA BE GOOD OR NOT. Narrator: AS VERNON'S NEW KEY MAN GETS AFTER THE GOLD... AND THIS WAS OUR DIVE HOLE RIGHT HERE WHERE THAT BOARD IS. ...JUST 200 YARDS AWAY... AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. YOU WANT TO GO, FROM HERE, SOUTHWEST. OKAY. ...FOR HIS FORMER KEY MAN, IT'S PAYBACK TIME. I LOVE CONTROVERSY IN THE MORNING! [ LAUGHS ] I'M FEELING GOOD OVER HERE, TOO. LET'S DO IT! THIS IS GONNA FINISH OFF OUR SEASON. LET'S GO. ALL THE WAY OVER HERE... Narrator: ANGERED OVER HIS FIRING, JASON IS GIVING UP THE GOODS TO THE KELLY BOYS. YOU'RE A CROOK, VERN, A [BLEEP] CROOK. JASON WALKER, THE HIDDEN SECRET. VERN PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT NOW BANKRUPT, GOING HOME, IF JASON WOULDN'T HAVE SAVED HIS SEASON. WE DID OUR BEST GOLD RIGHT THROUGH HERE. WE WERE SAVING THIS TO COME HERE LAST. RIGHT ON. WE'RE GONNA GO RUSH OUR [BLEEP] OVER HERE RIGHT NOW. DO IT. DO IT. OKAY, WE'RE GOING. LET'S GO GET OUR [BLEEP] AND GET IT OVER HERE. Narrator: THIS WINTER, THE KELLYS HAVE BROUGHT IN JUST 13 OUNCES, WORTH BARELY 17,000 BUCKS. JASON'S LEAD COULD TURN THEIR WHOLE SEASON AROUND. NO, WE WON'T. WE WON'T. WE'RE GONNA PROVE VERN [BLEEP] UP. WE WON'T, BRO. THANKS. I'VE SHARED MY SPOT BECAUSE VERN'S A SCUM BAG. HE'S A WORTHLESS SCUM BAG, AND EVERYBODY IN NOME KNOWS IT. HEY, YOU GOT TO LOVE DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES, HUH? JASON'S A PRETTY GOOD GUY TODAY. SOME DAYS, HE'S AN [BLEEP] BUT TODAY, I LOVE HIM. Narrator: SEVEN MILES TO THE EAST... ...IN DOWNTOWN NOME... Zeke: I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN DIVING OUT THERE IN THAT DEEP WATER FOR, WHAT -- LIKE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS NOW. WE'RE JUST -- WE'RE IN THE DANGER ZONE. WE ARE. Narrator: ...DIVER ZEKE TENHOFF HAS A PROBLEM. MY LEG'S GOING NUMB. LIKE, I'M GETTING REALLY DIZZY AND GETTING THE SPINS AND GETTING VERTIGO. I MEAN, THAT'S JUST KIND OF, LIKE, A BIG CHECKLIST OF, LIKE, DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS SYMPTOMS THAT I'M HAVING. Narrator: FOR NEARLY A WEEK... ...ZEKE AND HIS PARTNER, GLEN LeBARON, HAVE WORKED SIX-HOUR DIVE SHIFTS AT DEPTHS OF NEARLY 30 FEET... SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME AFTER AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF DIVING DOWN HERE AT THIS DEPTH, I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF DRUNK. Narrator: ...PUTTING THEM AT RISK OF DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS -- A DANGEROUS BUILD-UP OF NITROGEN IN THE BLOOD STREAM. I DON'T FEEL PHYSICALLY TIRED, BUT MY BRAIN FEELS REAL SLOW. Narrator: FOR ZEKE, THOSE FEARS ARE BECOMING A REALITY. Sarah: YOU HAVE NITROGEN POISONING, OKAY? OKAY, NOT OKAY FOR YOU TO CONTINUE DIVING. GLEN -- I DON'T CARE IF HE'S SUPERMAN. HE'S GONNA GET IT, TOO. NO, I'M NOT GONNA DIVE TONIGHT. I DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD. GLEN'S ALL FREAKIN' OUT ABOUT HIS BANK ACCOUNT, AND HOW WE'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH GOLD, AND THAT THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING SMOOTHLY ENOUGH, AND NOW THIS'LL BE ANOTHER MAJOR SLOWDOWN. Narrator: OUT AT THE DREDGE... Jasmin: HOW'S IT LOOKING DOWN THERE? Glen: RIGHT NOW, I'M PUNCHING A HOLE IN SOME COBBLE. AND SO FAR, SO GOOD. SEEING SOME COLOR. Narrator: ...DESPITE THE DEPTH, IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR GLEN. GOLD'S NOT HARD TO FIND IN THIS AREA. IT'S JUST A LITTLE DEEP, IS ALL. IT'S ABOUT YOU. WHAT? I GUESS HE'S HAVING NITROGEN POISONING, LIKE, BAD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT ON ME, GLEN. HE'S BEING SO CRABBY TODAY. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE HERE. Narrator: EIGHT MILES TO THE WEST... ...BACK AT THE WILD RANGER... Elaine: SO, YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA SUFFER AT ALL WITHOUT THE GREATEST DREDGER IN THE WORLD ON OUR TEAM? Juston: YEAH. ...JUSTON HAS BEEN UNDER THE ICE FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS, WORKING AN AREA OVER 30 FEET FROM THE DIVE HOLE. SEEING ANY GOLD DOWN THERE YET? NO, NOT YET. I'M STILL MOVING A COUPLE LAYERS OVER. A LOT OF ROCKS. I STILL HAVEN'T HIT NO TYPE OF GOOD BOTTOM. WE'LL WORK ON THIS FOR JUST A MINUTE, SEE IF WE CAN'T GET ON SOMETHING GOOD HERE. YEAH, I COPY. LOOKING ANY BETTER? UH... NOT QUITE SURE YET. JUST TRYING TO GET BACK THROUGH THIS LAYER OF COBBLE. IT'S HARD WORK. [ GRUNTS ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE [BLEEP] [ GRUNTS ] Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... ...AT THE WILD RANGER... Juston: WE GOT A SITUATION GOING ON. [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTING ] OH. THERE WE GO. Elaine: WHAT THE [BLEEP] I DON'T KNOW. DID IT FREEZE UP? YEAH, SOMETHING. WHEW. Vernon: WHAT HAPPENED, ELAINE? WE JUST HAD A FREEZE-UP IN THE REGULATOR. JUSTON LOST AIR. GAVE ME ABOUT TWO BREATHS OF A WARNING. AND THEN IT WAS JUST [BLEEP] NOTHING. Spenser: RIGHT. I'VE BEEN IN HIS POSITION, WHAT HE JUST WENT THROUGH, AND IT'S NO FUN. YOU NEVER REALIZE HOW PRECIOUS YOUR NEXT BREATH OF AIR IS UNTIL IT'S NOT THERE. YOU KNOW, IF IT HAD GOTTEN TANGLED, PULLED TIGHTER, AND THE TANGLE WAS WAY DOWN AT THE END OF THE HOSE, HE COULD STILL BE DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW. I'M ASSUMING THAT NOBODY'S GONNA DO THIS SPARE AIR THING. I MEAN, IT'S BEYOND ME. I CAN'T COMPREHEND THAT. IF I CAN MAKE IT BACK, I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE IT BACK. IF I GET FOULED UP AND TANGLED UP, AND I KNOW I CAN'T MAKE IT BACK, THEN I'LL RIP THAT MASK OFF AND USE THAT REGULATOR. Narrator: DIVING WITH AN EMERGENCY BAIL-OUT BOTTLE, JUSTON OPTED TO RACE FOR THE DIVE HOLE RATHER THAN DEPLOY HIS RESERVE. OH, YEAH, IT ALWAYS GETS YOUR HEART BEATING REAL FAST. YOU JUST GOT TO STAY CALM AND KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. BOBBY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A SAFETY MEETING. JUST GET YOUR ASS BACK TO THE HOSE, IS ALL YOU CAN DO, AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. Narrator: EVEN AFTER A BRUSH WITH DEATH... BUT HAVE TO GO DOWN AND MAKE US SOME MONEY. ...JUSTON PREPARES FOR ROUND TWO WITH THE BERING SEA. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S THE KIND OF ATTITUDE I LIKE. YEAH! Vernon: JUST GO FIND ME SOME GOLD. [ DOG BARKS SOFTLY ] YEAH, IT'S AT 120. Juston: IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A DIVER AND A GOLD DREDGER, YOU CAN'T SIT THERE AND CRY AND COMPLAIN ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING THAT HAPPENS. THERE JUST AIN'T NO ROOM FOR CRYBABIES. HELL, YEAH. WELL, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. GOT A NICE, BIG, PRETTY GOOD-SIZED BOULDER RIGHT HERE. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT LIES BENEATH. IT'S LOOKING A LOT BETTER. OH, YEAH. SEE, IT'S A GOOD COLOR RIGHT NOW. THAT'S BRIGHT. THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. THAT'S THE BOMB DIGGITY RIGHT THERE. THAT'S GOOD STUFF! OH, YEAH! HELL, YEAH. DREDGE IT ON UP. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GONNA HIT THAT GOOD SPOT. SO IF WE CAN JUST STAY IN THE GOLD LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE, WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. HEY, JASON, WE'RE DOING IT! Narrator: JUSTON'S NOT THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE FOUND A PAY STREAK. EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST... ON CLAIM 12... Glen: OH, THIS IS INTERESTING. ...AT THE MISS NOMER... I'M DREDGING A DROP-OFF IN THE HARD PAN HERE. AND AT BOTTOM OF THE DROP-OFF, THERE'S SOME PRETTY DECENT GOLD. ...UNDER 30 FEET OF WATER, GLEN LeBARON IS ALSO CASHING IN. IT'S ALL REAL FINE STUFF, BUT THERE'S GOLD JUST EVERYWHERE. TO DATE, GLEN AND ZEKE HAVE PULLED 10 OUNCES FROM THESE GROUNDS. TOPSIDE, GLEN'S GIRLFRIEND, JASMIN... Jasmin: HE'S JUST BEEN CRABBY ALL MORNING. HE NEEDS A BREAK, BUT ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS DREDGE. I'M JUST LETTING HIM DO HIS THING. I HOPE HE COMES UP HAPPY. AND HOPEFULLY, HE LIKES MY SEASHELLS. [ CHUCKLES ] I'LL TELL HIM THAT I MADE IT FOR HIM. IT'S THE BEST I'VE SEEN DOWN HERE. IT'S LIKE THE CENTER OF A GOLD VORTEX. Zeke: HELLO, JASMIN. Jasmin: HI. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY? DOING ALL RIGHT. HEY, GLEN, IT'S ZEKE. HOW'S IT GOING? IT'S GOING FINE. I FOUND THIS AREA DOWN HERE THAT LOOKS REALLY PROMISING. ALL RIGHT, FANTASTIC. WELL... ...YEAH, I MEAN, WHENEVER YOU WANT TO COME UP, I MEAN, I'D LIKE TO HAVE A CHAT WITH YOU. ALL RIGHT. COMING UP RIGHT NOW. Zeke: HAS IT BEEN STRESSFUL OUT HERE? Jasmin: YEAH, HE'S JUST HAVING A REALLY BAD DAY. I HOPE THE NITROGEN ISN'T GETTING TO HIM. HE SAYS IT'S NOT. Glen: GUESS I BETTER COME UP SLOWLY. MAKE SURE I GET ALL THE NITROGEN OUT OF MY SYSTEM. Jasmin: HE'S, LIKE, REALLY STRESSED OUT RIGHT NOW. [ DOOR OPENS ] Zeke: HOW'S IT GOING? OH, FINE, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, JUST, TODAY ENDED UP BEING REALLY FRUSTRATING AGAIN. YEAH. AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL, I'M REALLY -- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT REALLY, LIKE, HAVING A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THERE BEING, YOU KNOW, A NITROGEN PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THIS WHOLE LEG WENT NUMB... AND IT'S STILL NUMB. I'M HAVING SYMPTOMS. MM-HMM. IT'S UNDENIABLE, YOU KNOW, SO... YEAH, WE NEED TO MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE. I NEED TO MAKE SOME MONEY. WE NEED TO MAKE SOME MONEY. I KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE -- I'M NOT REALLY ARGUING WITH THAT. AND THE MONEY'S HERE. AND YOU'RE HAVING SOME NITROGEN SYMPTOMS, AND THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN. I REALLY DON'T THINK NITROGEN'S A PROBLEM FOR ME RIGHT NOW. I DON'T. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR LEG. WELL, SO, I MEAN, ARE YOU HAVING ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD REGARD AS SYMPTOMS OF... YOU KNOW, A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF NITROGEN? HONESTLY, LIKE, I'VE BEEN A LITTLE MORE IRRITABLE, BUT I THINK THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF JUST -- I'M JUST FRUSTRATED THAT, LIKE, MORE GOLD PRODUCTION ISN'T HAPPENING, AND THE GOLD'S THERE. I'M NOT READY TO BAIL OUT OF THIS SPOT. I'M DEFINITELY NOT QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S GOOD GOLD HERE. DEFINITELY NOT QUESTIONING THAT. WELL, ALL DAY LONG, I WAS AT 25 FEET. 25 FEET'S HARDLY A DANGEROUS, YOU KNOW, DEPTH. YOU KNOW, JUST TO SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW --" I MEAN, BASICALLY, YOUR RESPONSE IS, "I THINK IT'S SAFE." I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY SAFE. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY QUESTION MARKS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- THIS IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK OF YOU. LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DECIDE ON THIS RIGHT NOW. TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT LEAVING THIS PLACE RIGHT NOW, AFTER THE DAY I'VE HAD, YOU KNOW, IS JUST MORE THAN I CAN REALLY STAND. IN MY OBSERVATION, YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE IRRITABLE THAN YOU USUALLY ARE, THAT IT SEEMS TO ALMOST BE A PRETTY CLEAR SYMPTOM THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG. MM-HMM. ALL OF US CAN SEE THIS, GLEN -- ALL OF US BUT YOU. OKAY, WELL, THIS IS JUST -- THIS IS JUST ANOTHER -- THIS IS JUST... RIDICULOUS. I THINK I'M JUST GONNA -- I'M GONNA PULL -- I'M IN SUCH A BAD MOOD. I'M JUST GONNA PULL [BLEEP] GOLD. Zeke: YOU KNOW, I NEVER TELL GLEN HE'S WRONG. I'M NEVER LIKE, "GLEN, YOU'RE WRONG." BUT GLEN IS THE MOST DEFENSIVE PERSON I HAVE EVER MET IN MY LIFE. OUR GOLD STRESS AND OUR, YOU KNOW, NEED TO MAKE MONEY LIKE IMMEDIATELY REALLY CAN'T BE A FACTOR IN THIS DECISION. Narrator: EIGHT MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... TIPPED OFF TO A POTENTIAL HOT SPOT, THE FIGHTIN' KELLYS ARE PLANNING AN INVASION. YEAH, OUR PLAN RIGHT NOW IS TO MOVE THIS [BLEEP] AS FAST AS WE CAN, AND THEN WE GET SET UP, AND ANDY'S GONNA GO DOWN AND SEE IF THE GROUND IS ACTUALLY WORTH WORKING OVER THERE. Narrator: ALL IT TAKES... Kris: I MEAN, COME ON, LET'S JUST GET GOING HERE. ...IS A 700-FOOT MOVE. NICE AND EASY. Andy: STOP! [ LAUGHING ] BUT AT THE REAPER... WHAT THE [BLEEP] JUST HAPPENED? [ CONTINUES LAUGHING ] Narrator: ...THEY DON'T DO NOTHIN' NICE AND EASY. WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS THAT? Kris: IT'S FROZEN! Andy: FROZEN? I SAID TAKE IT SLOW. I JUST TORE UP MY [BLEEP] THOUSAND-DOLLAR SHACK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT FUNNY. WE JUST TORE THE WHOLE [BLEEP] FRAME IN HALF. I TOLD YOU IT WAS [BLEEP] FROZEN THREE INCHES ON THE SIDE OVER HERE! GO SLOW! IT WON'T BUDGE. WELL, THAT'S GREAT. WE JUST TORE OUR FRAME IN HALF. IT -- I KNOW, I KNOW. I TOLD EVERYBODY IT WAS FROZEN IN THREE INCHES ON THE SIDE HERE. Kris: BASICALLY, MY DAD CONSTRUCTED A PIECE OF [BLEEP] ON A COUPLE SKIS. SO WE STAY IN ONE SPOT SO [BLEEP] LONG THAT OUR SKIS ARE FROZEN SIX INCHES INTO THE ICE. THAT'S MY MASTER MECHANIC/ENGINEER/ DREDGE BUILDER/ULTIMATE MAN OF THE UNIVERSE. AND THEY SAY LUCK OF THE IRISH? [ SCOFFS ] WE AIN'T GOT NO LUCK. WE DO HAVE LUCK -- BAD LUCK. WE SHOULD HAVE USED PLASTIC. YOU KNOW, PLASTIC DOESN'T FREEZE INTO THE ICE. WHO THE [BLEEP] KNOWS THESE KIND OF THINGS? LIKE, SERIOUSLY! PLASTIC DOESN'T FREEZE IN -- THEY NEED TO WRITE THIS [BLEEP] DOWN IN A DREDGER'S HANDBOOK OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, LIKE... Narrator: WITH THEIR DREDGE FROZEN IN PLACE, THE KELLYS HAVE A SOLUTION... SO ARE WE STILL DOING IT? Brad: YEAH, CUT IT JUST ALONG THE ICE LINE. ...HACK IT TO PIECES. WANT ME TO SHOW YOU? NO, I GOT IT. I'M GONNA BE HERE ALL [BLEEP] DAY. MAKE SOME SANDWICHES. HEY, WE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW. LET US KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DONE. [BLEEP] YOU, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] THIS IS [BLEEP] STUPID. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... OHH [BLEEP] ...SIX HOURS AFTER RECEIVING A TIP THAT COULD SAVE THEIR SEASON, THE KELLYS HAVEN'T MOVED AN INCH. WE SHOULD BE ON THE GOLD, BUT WE'RE FROZEN IN SOLID. SIX HOURS TODAY. WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY [BLEEP] MONEY, AND LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS OUT TODAY. HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE THE SKIS ARE BROKEN FREE. ABOUT TIME. SEE, THAT'S HOW MY BROTHER REALLY MAKES HIS MONEY RIGHT THERE -- HANDS AND KNEES. SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP. [ LAUGHTER ] Brad: IT'S JUST CHEAP-ASS WOOD. YOU KNOW, HERE IN NOME, 50 BUCKS APIECE, WE CAN BUY SOME MORE. Kris: HOLD ON. COME BACK A FOOT! MOMENT OF TRUTH. OKAY, SO IT'S TAKEN US ALL DAY LONG TO GET TO THIS POINT. WE BETTER WATCH OUT, OR WE'RE GONNA MISS IT. OH [BLEEP] THANK GOD. HEY, BE CAREFUL. NOW TRY IT! ONE MORE! WHOO! GO, GO, GO! RIGHT! WHOO-HOO! I KNEW WE WERE GONNA DO IT. I NEVER DOUBTED MY TEAM. WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] WE'RE DOING SOMETIMES. Andy: WE'RE FREE! Kris: FREE AT LAST. [BLEEP] YEAH, MAN. I KNEW IT WAS GONNA WORK, HUH, EH? LOOK AT THE [BLEEP] WE LEFT IN OUR HOLE. I KNOW. YEAH! WE MADE IT, THOUGH. WE'RE JUST RIPPING OUR OPERATION TO [BLEEP] AND NOW, BASICALLY, WE HAVE A HUGE HOLE IN THE BACK. OUR BACK SIDE IS ALL BROKEN. OUR ENTIRE OPERATION IS AT A LEAN NOW BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S ALL MESSED UP. IF THIS HOLE PANS OUT, IT'D BE [BLEEP] AMAZING, 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA LAST TOO MANY MORE MOVES. DISASTER AVERTED. WE'VE STILL GOT LIKE 30% OF OUR SKIS LEFT. AS LONG AS WE CAN KEEP IT FROM FREEZING AGAIN, WE'LL BE FINE. Narrator: EIGHT MILES UP THE COAST... ...AT THE MISS NOMER... ...LOOKING TO PROVE THAT THE GROUNDS ARE WORTH THE RISK, GLEN HAS CLEANED THE DRAG AND SLUICE BOX. YEAH, 4.3 OUNCES FOR THAT ONE. IT'S NOT TOO SHABBY. IN JUST THE LAST THREE DAYS, THE SPOT HAS PRODUCED NEARLY 6 GRAND IN GOLD. Glen: THIS IS REPRESENTING, I THINK, THE POTENTIAL OF THIS LOCATION. AND WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS, ARE YOU WILLING TO JOIN ME IN DREDGING THIS SPOT FOR AT LEAST ONE OR TWO MORE DAYS? YOU KNOW, I HAVE VERY NOTABLE DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS SYMPTOMS. IT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND LIKE YOU'RE TAKING IT SERIOUSLY AT ALL. OKAY, WELL, BASICALLY, THIS IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. I'M NOT READY TO SAY GOODBYE TO THIS PLACE. I WANT UNTIL 5:00 TOMORROW TO SAY GOODBYE TO THIS PLACE AND [BLEEP] DREDGE HERE BECAUSE THERE'S [BLEEP] AWESOME GOLD. PROBABLY CLOSE TO 10 YEARS MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU. I KIND OF KNOW WHERE YOU ARE FIVE YEARS INTO IT, AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT TO LEARN. AND I CAN SEE IT WHEN YOU PAN. I CAN SEE IT WHEN YOU DREDGE. I CAN SEE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE MORE YEARS OF DREDGING TO DO TO GRADUATE TO MY LEVEL, BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH THOSE YEARS. AND WHETHER IT'S DREDGING HERE OR THE RIVER OR ANYWHERE, THERE'S LITTLE STEPS YOU MAKE THAT YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF UNTIL YOU GO THROUGH THOSE STEPS. WHY ARE YOU GETTING ANGRY RIGHT NOW? DO YOU FEEL LIKE I'M CHALLENGING YOU? NO, BECAUSE [BLEEP] I DON'T LIKE THIS [BLEEP] CONVERSATION. I THINK YOU'RE INTERMEDIATE AT BEST WITH YOUR MINING EXPERIENCE. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S A FACT. GLEN, GLEN, YOU -- YOU -- GLEN, YOU ARE JUST SIMPLY BEING AN [BLEEP] THERE IS NO WAY AROUND IT. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU ARE BEING AN [BLEEP] I MEAN, DOES IT MATTER TO YOU? I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN WORKING WITH ANYONE. YOU'RE NOT BEING NICE. [ ARGUES INDISTINCTLY ] I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] LEAVE HERE AT ALL. I THINK IT'S TOTALLY ABSURD TO [BLEEP] LEAVE HERE. I THINK IT'S [BLEEP] ABSURD. I THINK YOUR NUMB LEG MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH [BLEEP] NITROGEN ALTOGETHER. UH-HUH. I REALLY [BLEEP] THINK THAT. BUT WHAT I'M OBSERVING IS THAT YOU'RE [BLEEP] TOTALLY OFF THE CHAIN. LIKE, YOU'VE BECOME, LIKE -- I MEAN, AS FAR AS MY OBSERVATION IS, THERE MUST BE SOMETHING GOING ON IN YOUR BRAIN TO CAUSE YOU TO BE EXTREMELY EASY TO ANGER. I MEAN, THERE'S NOT -- IT PUTS -- YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH. I'VE FOUND -- HEY [BLEEP] YOUR [BLEEP] SMIRK, YOU [BLEEP] PUNK. WHAT? [ CHUCKLES ] [ LAUGHS ] YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT MY PSYCHE. AND YOU THINK THAT'S NOT GONNA BE SLIGHTLY [BLEEP] ANNOYING? YOU WERE JUST FLIPPING OUT. YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY, WIPE THAT SMILE OFF YOUR FACE, YOU [BLEEP] PUNK." PEOPLE HAVE PASSION, AND I HAVE PASSION ABOUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETIMES. YOU JUST CALLED ME AN INTERMEDIATE DREDGER WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. YOU ARE. AND YOU ARE. NONE OF THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU. YOU'RE A COMPLETELY INNOCENT PARTY. Zeke: AT THIS POINT, I THINK THAT YOU'RE JUST BEING SUCH A GIANT [BLEEP] THAT I DON'T REALLY SEE WHY I WOULD EVEN WANT TO EVEN CONTINUE EVEN THINK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, EVEN TRYING TO COME TO ANY SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH YOU ABOUT ANYTHING, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MY VOICE IS SILENT. [ SCOFFS, LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHS MOCKINGLY ] Zeke: ENOUGH. I MEAN, THIS IS THE LINE, YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE, YOU CAN'T TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS. YOU CAN'T. THAT'S A PARTNERSHIP THAT IS GONNA GO NOWHERE. [BLEEP] HIM. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME AT THE WILD RANGER... Vernon: HE'S COMING UP. ...FOR TWO DAYS, VERNON'S NEW ACE DIVER HAS BEEN PUSHING TO LEAD THE CREW BACK TO GLORY. Vernon: JUSTON'S SAYING HE WAS ON SOME DYNAMITE GOLD DOWN THERE. IT WAS LIKE THE BOTTOM WAS PAVED WITH GOLD. Narrator: NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE IF JUSTON CAN MEASURE UP TO JASON. JUSTON LIVES OR DIES BY WHAT HE DOES DOWN THERE. OH, YEAH, WE'RE ON KICK-ASS GOLD RIGHT HERE. IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST GOLD WE'VE BEEN ON ALL SEASON. THAT LAST HOLE WAS DAMN NEAR 40 OUNCES. I THINK IT CAME TO 38.77. THIS ONE -- I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS BE A 50-OUNCE HOLE. Narrator: WITH ONLY 20 DIVE HOURS TOTAL ON THE NEW HOLE... THIS IS A FRESH MAT BEFORE MY DIVE. Vernon: YESTERDAY. ...THE PROOF WILL BE IN THE SLUICE BOX. IT'S LOOKING DAMN GOOD. MAKES ME HAPPY. THE REGULATOR CAN FREEZE UP ALL IT WANTS. I'M GONNA JUST KEEP GETTING TO IT, KEEP PUSHING. THIS RIGHT HERE IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. Vernon: I'VE GOT THE BEST TEAM THAT I'VE EVER BEEN WITH, BAR NONE -- IN THE ARMY, IN THE MERCHANT MARINES, UP HERE MINING. NUGGET! WHOO! WE GOT JUSTON -- THIS GUY IS LIKE A TIGER SHARK UNDER THERE WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING THE GOLD. I MEAN, THIS GUY -- HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT. Narrator: THE NEXT STOP FOR A GOLD-LADEN SLUICE BOX IS THE CLEAN-UP SHACK. Juston: MY GOAL IS TO TOP JASON'S CLEANOUTS, AND IT WILL HAPPEN. I'M HOPING OUR OUNCE-PER-HOUR GOES UP, AND... IT'S ALL LOOKING GOOD. Bobby: ALL RIGHT, YOU READY TO SEE IT -- THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR? Juston: OH, MY GOD! [ LAUGHS ] WHOO! HELL, YEAH. NOW, THAT'S WHAT'S COMING TOGETHER AS A TEAM, RIGHT THERE. THAT'S COMING TOGETHER. RIGHT HERE, BOBBY. HERE WE GO. KILLIN' IT! JUSTON TURNED OUT TO BE A DAMN GOOD GOLD FINDER. HE TAKES OVER FROM JASON, AND IT'S A HELL OF AN UPGRADE. IT'S ABOUT A 1,000% UPGRADE, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. HEY, LET ME GET A PICTURE REAL QUICK. SMILE. SMILE FOR ME, JUSTON. [ LAUGHS ] TEAM'S UNITED. TEAM'S HAPPY. [ SCOFFS ] COULDN'T ASK FOR BETTER. WITH THE CREW I'VE GOT, SKY'S THE LIMIT. Narrator: WHILE VERNON'S CREW CLEAN GOLD... [ FLAG FLUTTERING ] WE GOT BLESSED WITH A GOOD SPOT. WE GOT OUR DREDGE LOOSE. WE CAN GET 30, 40 MORE OUNCES, IT'LL MAKE OUR SEASON. Narrator: ...THE REAPER BOYS HAVE FINALLY MADE IT TO THEIR NEW SPOT. Kris: WE GOT A HUGE TIP FROM JASON WALKER, A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE FROM VERN ADKISON, SO WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT WE DO BEST AND THAT'S TAKE EVERYTHING AND LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND. Narrator: BEFORE THEY CAN PUT IT TO THE TEST... THREE SIDE-BY-SIDES, BRAND-NEW, WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS HOLE. JUST, LET'S CONCENTRATE ON DOING THE HOLE. ...THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO SET UP SHOP. OKAY, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK AS A FAMILY. GET THE [BLEEP] OVER HERE. Kris: I AM WORKING AS A FAMILY. I'M [BLEEP] STANDING NEXT TO YOU, AREN'T I? IS THIS ALL -- CAREFUL. WHY ISN'T THAT BROKEN FREE? 'CAUSE I GOT A LITTLE PIECE RIGHT HERE THAT I CAN'T HIT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS. KEEP GOING THERE. HONEST TO GOD, IF I DON'T DO 90% OF THE WORK, ALL WE'RE GONNA DO IS ARGUE, AND NOTHING'S GONNA GET DONE. [ ANDY LAUGHS ] [BLEEP] AGAIN? YOU OKAY? [BLEEP] [BLEEP] WHY CAN'T YOU TRY TO [BLEEP] DO IT YOURSELF?! OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE GETTING MAD AT ME 'CAUSE YOU JUMPED -- NO, BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S [BLEEP] TWO OR THREE TIMES EVERYTHING YOU DO! THE HOLE'S DONE. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? IT'S NOT DONE, OR IT WOULD BE DONE! OCCASIONALLY, I GET A LITTLE BIT EXCITED, BUT REALLY, THAT'S AT THE POINT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE ALREADY PUSHED ME. [ BRAD SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS A [BLEEP] MORON. OKAY, SO [BLEEP] I'M ACTUALLY NOT THAT WET. JUST FREAKING OUT OVER NO REASON. LET'S SET THIS UP AND GET GOING. Narrator: AFTER CUTTING THE DIVE HOLE... [BLEEP] OKAY, ROLL THAT PIECE OF [BLEEP] ...THE KELLYS FACE A FAMILIAR FOE -- A TWO-TON ICE CUBE. OKAY, GO! FOUR WEEKS AGO... GO! ...THE FAMILY'S WITS... ...WERE MATCHED. WHOA. TODAY... FLOOR IT! ...THEY BROUGHT A TIRE. DIDN'T GET IT. OKAY, JUST BACK UP! WE JUST GOT TO MAKE IT WORK. FLOOR IT! HOLY [BLEEP] THAT WAS COLD! I THINK YOU'RE WEDGING IT THE WRONG WAY. HE'S GOT IT GOING. GO. YEAH! OKAY, GOOD JOB. THAT WAS CLOSE. GOOD LITTLE "OLé!" [ BOTH LAUGH ] BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY DO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM, WE CAN MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. IT JUST TAKES US A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN NORMAL PEOPLE. WE'RE THERE. YEAH, WE JUST GOT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF... LITTLE FINISHING TOUCHES TO OUR DIVE HOLE, AND WE'RE PRETTY MUCH CLOSE ENOUGH. THAT MOVE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN TWO HOURS, THE WHOLE THING. Narrator: THE GRAND TOTAL TO MOVE JUST 700 FEET -- THE KELLYS LOST A DAY AND A HALF, TWO WOODEN SKIS, AND THE ENTIRE BACK SIDE OF THEIR DREDGE. I REALLY HOPE THIS IS WORTH IT. WHAT A BITCH. IF I HIT THE MOTHER LODE, I WOULD RETIRE. IF I HIT THE MOTHER LODE, I WOULD DREDGE FOR FUN. GIVE TO CHARITY. SPEND IT ALL ON GOLD MINING. WHAT'S THE MOTHER LODE -- LIKE, A HUGE AMOUNT? I WOULD GOLD-PLATE A GRILL. I'M GONNA HAVE MYSELF A TRICKED-OUT, 85-FOOT, STEEL-HULLED SAILING YACHT. NOT A GOLDEN GRILL, BUT A GOLDEN... [ IMITATES MEAT GRILLING ] ALL THE AMENITIES, INCLUDING A MOON POOL AND A TRAINED DOLPHIN TO FOLLOW ME EVERYWHERE I GO. IF I HIT THE MOTHER LODE, I WOULD DEFINITELY JUST KEEP LOOKING FOR THE NEXT ONE. Narrator: IN THE CITY OF NOME... AT VERNON ADKISON'S TRAILER... Vernon: BOBBY, YOU GOT THAT STUFF COOKED OFF? SHOULD BE COOL ENOUGH. ...FOR JUSTON, THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS ARRIVED. WITH JUST 20 HOURS OF MINING, IT'LL TAKE 12 OUNCES OR BETTER TO BEAT THEIR RATE FOR THE LAST CLEANUP. 16.17. [BLEEP] [ LAUGHTER ] WE KILLED IT. LET ME ADD THAT IN THERE. Narrator: 16.17 OUNCES IS WORTH MORE THAN $21,000... OUR TAKE WENT UP DRAMATICALLY AFTER JASON LEFT. Elaine: HELL, YEAH. SOUNDS GOOD SAYING IT. Narrator: ...CEMENTING JUSTON'S PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE CREW. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD. NOT BAD. Juston: JASON'S GONE NOW, AND I HOPE WE CAN KEEP JUST ROCKING AND ROLLING AND JUST KEEP BRINGING IN MORE GOLD, YOU KNOW? Vernon: BOY, I'M REAL HAPPY. BEST TEAM I'VE WORKED WITH, BAR NONE. DAD'S TAKING US ALL OUT FOR A STEAK DINNER TONIGHT. RIGHT, DAD? SWEET. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: BACK AT THE MISS NOMER... Glen: ZEKE AND I HAVE REACHED A CROSSROAD. WE'VE BEEN INEFFECTIVE AS A TEAM. WE HAVE NOT REALIZED OUR POTENTIAL, AND WE'VE REACHED THE POINT WHERE IT'S TIME TO PART WAYS. Narrator: ...THE FIVE-WEEK PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GLEN LeBARON AND ZEKE TENHOFF IS ENDING IN DIVORCE. Zeke: GLEN IS JUST A PSYCHO. YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT GLEN DOESN'T WANT A PARTNERSHIP. HE WANTS A SLAVE. CLEARLY, WE HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE WE HAVE SOME IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES. I TOLD ZEKE THAT HE WAS AN INTERMEDIATE DREDGER AT BEST. AND I MEANT THAT, AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S TRUE. AND HE LIKES TO THINK THAT I'M JUST ARROGANT. I TOLD HIM MY HONEST OPINION ABOUT WHAT I THOUGHT OF HIS ABILITY, AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS ANYMORE. Glen: AND THIS IS THE REST OF OUR SPLIT. LET'S WEIGH THIS UP. THERE'S THE PIECE OF PAPER. Narrator: NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SETTLING THEIR ASSETS. OKAY, 5.74. MINUS 15%... 2.4395 WOULD BE YOUR CUT. I'M GONNA SAY THAT THIS IS PROBABLY GONNA BE WORTH, YOU KNOW, ABOUT -- GOD. WHAT -- A LITTLE UNDER 3 GRAND, I IMAGINE? YEAH, ABOUT $2,500. YEAH, 2,500 BUCKS. YOU KNOW, I'LL PAY SOME BILLS AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT. ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD TO DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER RIGHT NOW. I DIDN'T GET A LOT OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT. NO, I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU. I DON'T EVEN REALLY CARE IF WE'RE DOING THAT, DUDE. YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO SHAKE MY HAND? NO, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SHAKE YOUR HAND. IF YOU WON'T EVEN SHAKE MY HAND, I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY REASON TO SPEAK TO YOU ANYMORE. YEAH, WELL -- YOU'RE JUST INCORRIGIBLE. MM-HMM. DUDE, YOU'RE JUST -- YOU'RE JUST ABSOLUTELY SMUG, MAN. LIKE, YOU'RE JUST A [BLEEP] [BLEEP] YOU'RE THE [BLEEP] LIKE, LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE SO PLEASED. YOU'RE SO [BLEEP] I'M NOT PLEASED ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A DISAPPOINTMENT. YOU WON'T EVEN SHAKE MY HAND. YOU'RE CLEARLY PLEASED. WHAT ARE YOU SO [BLEEP] PLEASED ABOUT? IT PROVES TO ME THAT, LIKE -- DUDE, I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] TALK TO YOU. [BLEEP] OFF. UNBELIEVABLE. YOU'RE SO SMUG, BABY. I'M SO SMUG. YOU KNOW, THE HANDSHAKE IS JUST TOTAL PHONY BALONEY. LIKE, ON THE TERMS THAT WE'RE LEAVING ON, A HANDSHAKE ISN'T APPROPRIATE. WE'RE NOT LEAVING ON FRIENDLY TERMS. WELL, IT WAS A BITTERSWEET VICTORY, BUT WE'RE FREE. I KNOW. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE -- A BURDEN. I REALLY TRIED. I GET AN "A" FOR EFFORT. YOU GET AN "A"-PLUS FOR EFFORT. I GET AN "A"-PLUS FOR EFFORT. YEAH. YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] I'M OUT OF HERE. Zeke: WITH GLEN, IT'S LIKE -- OKAY, WHEN YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP -- LIKE, SAY YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A GIRLFRIEND. IF YOU KIND OF THINK IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE MOMENT WHEN YOU SHOULD END IT. YOU SHOULDN'T WAIT FOR, LIKE, A MORE CONVENIENT TIME. THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME TO BREAK UP WITH GLEN. IT'S NOT. IT PUTS ME IN A DIFFICULT FINANCIAL SITUATION, BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE. I'M FREE. I'M FREE TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE SUCCEEDED ON MY OWN, UNDER MY OWN AUTHORITY BEFORE, AND I CAN DO IT AGAIN. Narrator: ZEKE AND GLEN'S DOOMED PARTNERSHIP EARNED THEM A TOTAL OF 31 OUNCES. NOW THEY'LL START FROM SCRATCH. AS FOR THE KELLYS -- WELL, THEY MOVED THEIR DREDGE. Vernon: LET THE GOLD WARS BEGIN. I WANT TO GET TO THAT NUGGET FIRST. Man: DANG, YOU'VE DONE WELL. YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOME! YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE NOME! Man: HEY, DUDES, MY AIR! MY AIR, DUDES!
