 ♪ GOLD CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: IN THE FROZEN PORT OF NOME, ALASKA... Emily: GOT TO GET SOME GOLD TODAY. IT'S REALLY HARD TO EVEN DESCRIBE WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE I FEEL FOR THIS ICE-MINING SEASON. WE HAVE A LOT OF ODDS AGAINST US, AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME. Narrator: ...FOUR WEEKS INTO THE WINTER MINING SEASON, TENSIONS ARE RISING ACROSS THE FLEET. YOU SIT OUT HERE AND GRIND AND GRIND AND GRIND, AND THE LAST TWO HOLES WERE DEAD, SO I'M JUST BLEEDING MONEY AGAIN. Vernon: THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT RIGHT HERE. WHATEVER WE GOT IN THAT PAN, WE GOT SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES MORE IN THE BOX. Narrator: CREWS THAT HAVE HIT PAY DIRT ARE WORKING ROUND THE CLOCK. Vernon: I'M GONNA STAY HERE UNTIL I GET MY SHARE OF GOLD OUT THERE OFF THE BOTTOM OF THAT SEA. NEPTUNE'S GOLD IS COMING TO ME. Narrator: WHILE FOR EVERYONE ELSE... WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? ...THE CHANCE TO TURN A PROFIT IS SLOWLY MELTING AWAY. Kris: OH, I'M REALLY TRYING AS HARD AS I CAN TO GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. JUST MAKE IT WORK. THAT'S MY WHOLE PHILOSOPHY RIGHT NOW, IS JUST MAKE IT WORK BY ANY MEANS. Narrator: ONE MILE EAST OF NOME HARBOR, AT THE MISS NOMER... YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU FINE. Narrator: ...WITH 25 OUNCES WORTH MORE THAN $32,000 BANKED FOR THE SEASON, ZEKE TENHOFF WORKS HIS DIVE SHIFT UNDER A FOUR-FOOT LID OF ICE. Sarah: HOW'S IT LOOKING DOWN THERE? TENDING TOPSIDE -- ZEKE'S GIRLFRIEND, SARAH DUNN. THREE DAYS AGO... IT'S TIME TO MOVE, FOR SURE. Narrator: ...TO CHASE THE GOLD, ZEKE AND PARTNER, GLEN LeBARON, MOVE THEIR OPERATION TO DEEPER WATERS. YEAH, GO VERY, VERY SLOW. THEIR REWARD... Kenny: 10.32. Glen: WHOO-HOO! Narrator: ...A 10-OUNCE CLEAN-UP AND THIRD PLACE ON THE LEADER BOARD. BEEN WORKING HARD... DOING A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR DOWN HERE. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME AFTER AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF DIVING DOWN HERE AT THIS DEPTH... I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF DRUNK. Sarah: IN THIS DEPTH, COMPARED TO LAST WEEK, WE WERE DIVING, AND THEY WERE IN 17, 18 FOOT. ZEKE'S PUTTING IN FIVE- TO SIX-HOUR DIVE SHIFTS HERE. AND HE WAS PUTTING IN EIGHT-HOUR DIVE SHIFTS AT THE LAST PLACE. AND HE IS WAY MORE TIRED. WHAT KIND OF AREA ARE YOU WORKING RIGHT NOW? WHAT'S IT LOOKING LIKE? I DON'T KNOW. HE SAID IT WAS, LIKE, REALLY AWESOME AND SOME OF THE BEST GOLD HE'S SEEN SO FAR. BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE. Narrator: TO MARK GOOD GOLD, GLEN HAS LEFT LIGHTS ON THE OCEAN FLOOR TO DIRECT ZEKE EXACTLY WHERE TO MINE. NOT REALLY SEEING THE SUPER-REALLY-GOOD GOLD THAT GLEN WAS TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. ZEKE LIKES TO BE IN CHARGE. AND GLEN'S BEING JUST A LITTLE TOO ANAL, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE ABOUT EVERYTHING. Glen: WHAT ARE YOU SEEING DOWN THERE? ARE YOU SEEING SOME GOLD? Zeke: YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. LIKE, THIS AREA -- THE COBBLE FIELD, I MEAN... YEAH, WELL, LET'S CLEAN THE BOX. I BET YOU -- I DON'T KNOW. I WAS SEEING SOME DAMN GOOD [BLEEP] UNLESS IT JUST SPONTANEOUSLY ENDED, SOMETHING'S AWRY BECAUSE SOME OF THE BEST GROUND I'VE BEEN SEEING IS RIGHT THERE. SO I'M A LITTLE BIT [BLEEP] IRRITATED. IT'S REALLY SIMPLE. I HAVE FAR MORE EXPERIENCE THAN ZEKE, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I KNOW THAT I OUTRANK HIM AND MY JUDGMENTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS. BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS I THINK THAT IF WE DREDGE REAL HARD FOR SIX DAYS, I THINK THAT WE COULD GET TWO POUNDS OF GOLD. AND I'M KIND OF HAVING A FINANCIAL CRISIS. BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S LIKE -- I KNOW IT'S GOOD. IT'S REALLY MINING-WORTHY GROUND. Zeke: I MEAN, YOU SOUND, LIKE, 75% CERTAIN THAT IT'S REALLY GOOD. YOU MAY PRETEND THAT YOU'RE 100% CERTAIN, BUT I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT 75% CERTAIN IT'S REALLY GOOD. I THINK THAT IN ONE WEEK, I CAN DO 30 OUNCES HERE BY MYSELF. Glen: THE BIGGEST CONCERN ABOUT WORKING WITH ZEKE IS THE CONFLICT OF OPINION AND THE CONFLICT OF EGOS AND JUST REALLY THE CONFLICT OF STRATEGY. SOME OF THE GROUNDS THAT I GIVE THE THUMBS-UP, HE GIVES THE THUMBS-DOWN, AND THAT'S CREATING A MAJOR ISSUE RECENTLY. Narrator: AFTER ZEKE REPORTED NO GOLD IN THE AREA, THE SELF-PROCLAIMED BEST DREDGER IN NOME ISN'T ABOUT TO TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT. HOW'S YOUR WATER? WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, JASMIN, TENDING, GLEN CHECKS OUT THE SUPPOSEDLY DEAD SPOT. OKAY, LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE. YOU KNOW, ZEKE JUST LEFT THIS DREDGE DOWN HERE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LOCATION. AND IT LOOKS LIKE ALL HE DID WAS A BUNCH OF PROSPECTING. YEAH, I THINK I'M GONNA GO WORK THAT AREA AGAIN. PROSPECTING DOESN'T MAKE MONEY UNLESS YOU MINE. HE SAID THAT THE GOLD IN THIS AREA WAS LESS THAN PHENOMENAL, AND HE STARTED MOVING AROUND. GIVE ME A BREAK. LESS THAN PHENOMENAL? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YEAH, THERE'S -- THERE'S GOLD JUST FALLING OUT OF THIS EVERYWHERE. THIS IS THE KIND OF MATERIAL YOU JUST -- YOU HOLD THE NOZZLE STILL FOR A SECOND, AND GOLD JUST STARTS TRICKLING OUT OF THE MATERIAL IN JUST ANY PLACE YOU LOOK. THIS IS REALLY GOOD GOLD, AND THIS IS THE KIND OF GOLD THAT'S GONNA GET US 3 TO 6 OUNCES A DAY. OKAY, WELL, GOOD LUCK. YEAH, THIS IS JUST REALLY UNBELIEVABLE. WE WENT THROUGH ALL THIS EFFORT TO MOVE HERE, AND WE'VE PRODUCED VERY LITTLE GOLD IN ONE OF THE RICHEST PLACES I'VE EVER FOUND. AND I'M JUST FURIOUS THAT ZEKE DIDN'T ACTUALLY MINE. Narrator: JUST A MILE AWAY, OVER ON CLAIM 14, AT THE EROICA... BACK ON THE ICE -- THE MELTING ICE. Narrator: ....WEEKS INTO THE ICE SEASON, OWNER EMILY RIEDEL HASN'T YET MADE A DIME. BECAUSE OF THIS HOT-WATER HEATER, I COULDN'T MINE. AND NOW WE'RE JUST HOPING IT'S THAWED OUT AND READY TO GO. Narrator: ON THEIR LAST DIVE... UP! PULL ME UP! Narrator: ...ICE IN THE HOT-WATER LINES NEARLY COST CREWMAN TONY MANN HIS LIFE. MY [BLEEP] REGULATOR FROZE. COME ON, BABY. COME ON. YOU GOT WATER? GOT WATER. WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO! ALREADY 50K IN THE HOLE FOR HER DREDGE, EMILY NEEDS TO START PRODUCING GOLD FAST. AND THE NEXT DIVER UP... ...IS THE CAPTAIN, HERSELF. I'M JUST READY TO PUT IT PAST ME AND GET DOWN THERE AND WORK. AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS. TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, I'M STILL SCARED [BLEEP]LESS BY IT. I HAD A COUPLE OF SCARY EXPERIENCES, AND NOW, THIS IS KIND OF LIKE A TRIGGER FOR ME. Narrator: IN HER CAREER AS A DIVER... ...CRIPPLING PANIC ATTACKS HAVE COST EMILY RESPECT... YOU'RE NOT A MINER, AND YOU'RE NOT AN ASSET TO HIS OPERATION. ...AND CREDIBILITY. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BE A GOLD MINER AND A DREDGER IF YOU DON'T DIVE. Tony: AND REMEMBER -- ME AND DARYL'S ON THE END OF THAT [BLEEP] HOSE, SO KEEP YOUR LINE CLEAR, AND THEN ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GIVE US A SHOUT, AND WE'LL PULL YOUR ASS UP. SO JUST REMEMBER TO BREATHE OUT ON YOUR WAY UP. ALL RIGHT. 10-4. LEADERSHIP MAKES ME HAPPY. I LIKE BEING IN CONTROL OF THINGS. BUT IF YOU WERE REALLY TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO RUN A DREDGE, YOU SHOULD BE A DIVER. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE FOR. IT'S SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO MYSELF. SHE SOUNDS GOOD. SHE'S WILLING TO WORK. SHE NEEDS TO GET HER BUTT BACK IN THE WATER, AND HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. I JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I'M AT. LET ME JUST KIND OF MAKE SURE I'M SEEING EVERYTHING. Daryl: TAKE A LITTLE WALKABOUT. CHECK IT OUT FOR A WHILE, AND JUST RELAX. OKAY. GIVEN HER DIVE HISTORY, I HOPE SHE JUST -- IF SHE CAN KEEP HER ANXIETY DOWN, SHE'LL BE JUST FINE. JUST GIVE ME A SECOND TO KIND OF FIGURE [BLEEP] OUT. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BREATHE. [ GROANS ] WHAT'S GOING ON? OH, NO, I JUST... IT'S BEEN A WHILE, YOU KNOW? GETTING BACK INTO THE SWING OF THINGS. TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN. SHE'S BACK. SHE'S NOT FREAKING OUT. SHE'S ACTUALLY GETTING SOME WORK DONE. THAT'S SWEET. THAT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US. HER SELF-ESTEEM, OUR RESPECT FOR HER, AND SOME GOLD IN THE BOX. SO IT WORKS ALL THE WAY AROUND. WIN-WIN, BROTHER. YEAH, JUST SLOW YOUR BREATHING DOWN. YEAH, YOU GUYS, I'M GONNA COME UP. SPOKE TOO SOON, DARYL. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, AT THE EROICA... UH, HOLD ON. YEAH, JUST SLOW YOUR BREATHING DOWN. Narrator: JUST 15 MINUTES INTO HER DIVE... YEAH, YOU GUYS, I'M GONNA COME UP. SPOKE TOO SOON, DARYL. ...CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL HAS BEEN SPOOKED. YEAH, IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE FOR HER TO GET HER CONFIDENCE BACK. IT'S A WEIRD THING. IT'S LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE I'M ANXIOUS OR IF IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING HARDER TO BREATHE. YEAH, YEAH... UH, I WOULDN'T RISK IT. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE FREEZING UP AT ALL, TRUST ME, IT'S NOT A FUN FEELING. YOU'RE NOT A MINER, AND YOU'RE NOT AN ASSET TO HIS OPERATION. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BE A GOLD MINER AND A DREDGER IF YOU DON'T DIVE. ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA KEEP DREDGING. Tony: THERE YOU GO. JUST SLOW DOWN. YOU KNOW, JUST THROW ROCKS, AND, YOU KNOW, JUST KEEP YOUR BREATHING DOWN. I'M GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE, ACTUALLY. THERE YOU GO. YEAH, THERE'S SOME GOOD COLOR DOWN HERE, YOU GUYS. YEAH! HELL, YEAH! OHH! [ LAUGHS ] [ CHUCKLES ] AH [BLEEP] YEAH, I'M THE BEST DREDGER EVER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE SHE HAS ANXIETY ABOUT AS FAR AS DIVING GOES, BUT I THINK SHE'S GETTING OVER IT, SLOWLY BUT SURELY. THE MORE TIME IN THE WATER, THE MORE COMFORTABLE YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THE WATER. SO SHE'S GETTING IT BACK NOW. HA! HA HA HA! HA HA! Narrator: EIGHT MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... HOW'S IT GOING? Kris: IT'S GOING THE SAME AS IT GOES EVERY DAY. EVERYTHING'S FREEZING TOO FAST. IT'S WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR MOTOR IN A [BLEEP] ENGINE HOUSE. WITH JUST 13 OUNCES OF GOLD COLLECTED FOR THE SEASON, THE KELLY FAMILY FIGHT TO GET THE MOTOR RUNNING ON THEIR ULTRA-LOW-BUDGET DREDGE, THE REAPER. SO YOU THINK, "NO, LET'S [BLEEP] KEEP IT OUT IN A [BLEEP] AREA SO IT CAN FREEZE EVERY 10 --" CALM DOWN, KRIS. SO FAR THIS SEASON.... [BLEEP] WHAT A GHETTO PIECE OF [BLEEP] ...OWNER BRAD KELLY'S SHODDY EQUIPMENT HAS CUT INTO GOLD PRODUCTION. WE BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD FOR YOU. WE HAD A [BLEEP] WEEK THIS WEEK. A LOT OF BREAKDOWNS. AND HIS NEW FAMILY HAS BEEN A CONSTANT DISTRACTION. LET GO FOR A SECOND. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS. EVERYTHING'S GOOD TO GO. HOPEFULLY IT WORKS OUT. NOW THE LATEST DISTRACTION COMES COURTESY OF BRAD'S YOUNGEST SON, ANDY... ...IN THE FORM OF ASPIRING DIVER KATY PRIESTER. KRIS SAID HE PUT IT ON SOME GOLD LAST TIME HE WAS DOWN. SO I'M HOPING THAT THERE'S SOME VIRGIN GROUND AROUND HERE. MY RELATIONSHIP WITH KATY PRIESTLY IS WE'RE FRIENDS. I'M READY TO DO SIX, EIGHT HOURS EVERY DAY. Andy: NOBODY EVER LET HER GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN, SO I TOLD HER, "[BLEEP] IF YOU WANT TO GO ON THE BOTTOM, I'LL THROW YOUR ASS DOWN THERE." I'M HERE TO DIVE AND GET SOME GOLD. I'M NOT HERE TO PLAY GAMES. Katy: I'M FROM ARIZONA. A LOT OF THINGS BROUGHT ME TO NOME, NOT JUST GOLD MINING. TELECOMMUNICATIONS. UNZIP. I'M GONNA GET CERTIFIED IN MAY FOR OPEN BODY WATER. BASICALLY, GET SOME EXTRA TIME DOWN THERE. MAYBE EVEN HIT UP SOME BEAUTIFUL CORAL. NO, DON'T MESS WITH IT. Brad: SHE SAID SHE DOVE BEFORE, AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A REGULATOR WAS. THAT'S PRETTY BASIC. WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS SHE DIES DOWN THERE, AND WE GOT TO DRAG HER ASS OUT. Narrator: IF YOU'RE KEEPING SCORE AT HOME, THAT IS THE LEAST-EXPERIENCED DIVER ATTEMPTING THE MOST DANGEROUS JOB ON THE CHEAPEST DREDGE ON ICE. LET'S SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO. Narrator: WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? ALL RIGHT. OKAY. COME ON. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE'S GETTING WATER INSIDE OF HER HOOD. OF COURSE IT'S GONNA GET WET. YOU'RE IN A WET SUIT. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING DOWN HERE. OH, HELLO. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING THAT WAY. FOLLOW THE NOZZLE. IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT GETTING ANY AIR. WHAT SHOULD I DO? JUST TAKE A DEEP -- I'M SURE SHE'S HEARD THAT BEFORE. OKAY. FEELS PRETTY GOOD TO BE DOWN HERE, FINALLY, WITH PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME. THE LIGHTS ARE ON, BUT NOBODY'S HOME. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. OH, NO. MAN. SOMETHING'S GOING ON. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HELP! HELP! HELP! WHAT'S GOING ON? HELP! [ GRUNTS ] HELP! HELP! HELP! [ GROANS ] Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME... HELP! HELP! HELP! WHAT'S GOING ON? HELP! [ GRUNTS ] HELP! HELP! HELP! [ GROANS ] HELP! HELP! TAKE THE MASK OFF! TAKE THE MASK OFF, PLEASE! PLEASE! ARE YOU OKAY? NO, I CAN'T BREATHE. SHE'S JUST FREAKING OUT. IT'S OKAY. OKAY, WALK. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] I COULDN'T EVEN HEAR HER. OKAY, CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN. EVERYTHING'S FINE. DONE GOOD, GIRLY. DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU GONNA GET SUITED UP? OH, YOU'RE ALREADY SUITED UP. I REALLY KNOW THAT'S THE END OF HER. SHE'S NOT GONNA COME BACK. ANYTHING ELSE? SOMETIMES YOU NEED A LITTLE FEAR IN YOUR LIFE, A LITTLE JOLT TO BRING YOU BACK TO REALITY AND GET HER BACK AT SAFEWAY OR, YOU KNOW, 7-ELEVEN -- WHATEVER SHE DOES. NOW I GOT TO GO DOWN AND MAKE MY OWN MONEY. NO, SHE'D NEVER DIVE AGAIN FOR US. IT'S A LIABILITY LAWSUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN, YOU KNOW. YOU DID REALLY GOOD, GIRL. NO. Narrator: WITH THE KATY PRIESTER EXPERIMENT OFFICIALLY OVER, SEVEN MILES TO THE EAST, ON CLAIM 12.... ZEKE'S GONNA BE HERE ANY TIME. I'LL LET HIM JUST START HIS SHIFT AND DO WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] HE WANTS. Narrator: ...GLEN LeBARON SURFACES AFTER FOUR HOURS UNDER THE ICE. I NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK WITH ZEKE. I'VE BEEN OUT HERE SPINNING MY [BLEEP] WHEELS. YOU KNOW THAT. HOW MUCH DREDGING DO I GET TO DO? LIKE, NONE. ALL I DO I COME OUT HERE, AND I GET EVERYTHING READY FOR ZEKE, YOU KNOW? AND THEN ZEKE DOESN'T DREDGE THERE. ZEKE IS JUST REALLY FUSSY ABOUT THE GROUND. HE WANTS IT SHALLOW, AND HE WANTS IT RICH. AND, LIKE, I'VE SPENT MORE TIME UNDERWATER DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT THESE GROUNDS ARE WORTH WORKING THAN HE HAS, AND SOME OF THE GROUND THAT ZEKE'S BEEN TURNING DOWN I THINK IS REALLY GOOD. HE SPENDS TOO MUCH [BLEEP] TIME POTHOLING AND [BLEEP] DINKING AROUND DOWN THERE INSTEAD OF JUST CUTTING A BIG, WIDE SWATH. THE HONEST TRUTH IS HE HASN'T GOTTEN US A [BLEEP] DAMN HONEST OUNCE. THE TIME I'VE BEEN GIVING TO HIM HAS ONLY BEEN [BLEEP] CUTTING DOWN PRODUCTION. HE NEEDS TO, LIKE, BUNKER DOWN AND, LIKE, COVER SOME GROUND. I LIKE BEING EFFICIENT. I LIKE BEING EFFECTIVE. AND [BLEEP] THINGS ARE NOT [BLEEP] EFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE ENOUGH, AND IT'S REALLY [BLEEP] PISSING ME OFF. IT'S COSTING ME A LOT OF [BLEEP] MONEY. [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] Zeke: HOW'S IT GOING? HEY, ZEKE. THERE IS A LOT OF GOLD DOWN HERE, AND WE'RE NOT REALIZING OUR POTENTIAL HERE. I JUST REACHED THIS POINT OF FRUSTRATION, AND I JUST, LIKE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF EXPLODED, BUT, LIKE, I'M CALMING DOWN. AND WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY WHERE WE CAN BOTH EFFECTIVELY MINE. THE BIG PROBLEM HERE IS THAT, LIKE, WE'RE NOT IN, LIKE, A TREMENDOUSLY CONSISTENT AREA. I WOULD CONSIDER THE GROUND THAT I SAW DOWN THERE LAST -- I WOULD CONSIDER THAT CONSISTENT, AND I THINK IT'S WORTH CUTTING SOME BIG SWATHS AND GRIDDING IT OFF AND WORKING IT ALL. THE DREDGE IS BACK IN THE GENERAL VICINITY WHERE I LEFT IT AT THE END OF MY LAST SHIFT. AND EVERYWHERE I LOOK, IT'S DREDGE-WORTHY STUFF -- GOOD GOLD ALL THROUGH IT. MM-HMM. YOU KNOW? AND SO I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW, EXCELLENT GOLD, NOT JUST GOOD GOLD. MM-HMM. SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MOW IT ALL. IT SEEMS TO ALL BE PRODUCING. YEAH, IT'S... YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S, UH... YEAH, IT'S -- IT'S -- IT'S LIKE -- YEAH, IT'S JUST BEEN SO INCONSISTENT IN THIS AREA. IT'S LIKE... YEAH, I'M EXCITED TO GO BACK DOWN THERE TODAY AND LOOK AT IT AGAIN. OKAY. WELL, GOOD. GLEN'S AN OPEN BOOK. IT'S REAL EASY TO SEE THAT GLEN IS A DIFFICULT GUY. HE'S GOT A GIANT EGO. AND ANYONE WITH A GIANT EGO IN THE MINING WORLD IS DEFINITELY A DIFFICULT GUY TO WORK WITH. YOU HOLD YOUR COOL LIKE NOTHING. SO IMPRESSIVE. I WANTED TO TELL GLEN TO GO... IF GLEN GOES DOWN AND DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD DAY, HE GETS REALLY, REALLY FUSSY AND KIND OF, LIKE, BLAMES IT ON ME. WE HAVE TO LAUGH AT IT, OR ELSE WE WOULD JUST PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE. WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE HIS EGO IS SO INCREDIBLY DELICATE. IT'S LIKE, "AAH." [ CHUCKLES ] Zeke: I'VE COMMITTED TO TRYING AS HARD AS I CAN TO MAKING A MINING PARTNERSHIP WORK WITH GLEN. AND, YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO TRY TO REALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THINGS THAT I COMMIT MYSELF TO. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- IT'S GETTING HARDER. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ALASKA, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Vern: HEY, JASON, HOW'S THE VISIBILITY UNDER THERE? Jason: VISIBILITY'S JUST FINE, VERN. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ISN'T FINE. WE REALLY GOT TO GET OUR [BLEEP] TOGETHER, OKAY? SARCASTIC BULL[BLEEP] COMING UP FROM DOWN THERE. ...OWNER VERNON ADKISON AND HIS DAUGHTER, ELAINE, MAN THE COMS FOR VERNON'S CREW CHIEF, JASON WALKER. HE DOES, LIKE, ONE WALK-AROUND AND TRIES TO FIND SOMETHING TO BITCH ABOUT. HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB PUTTING US ON THE GOLD. YEAH, OKAY. BUT THAT DOESN'T GIVE HIM A FREE PASS TO JUST DO WHATEVER THE "F" HE WANTS. SO FAR THIS SEASON... Jason: I'M ON SOME GOLD. THAT'S A DAMN GOOD TEST MAT. Narrator: ...VERNON HAS COLLECTED 61 OUNCES -- WORTH NEARLY 80,000 BUCKS -- THE BEST GOLD OF HIS THREE-YEAR CAREER. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. Narrator: BUT JASON AND HIS EGO... NO, HE'S CHALLENGING ME AT EVERY MOMENT! IT'S NOT GONNA CONTINUE! ...ARE TEARING THE TEAM APART. I KNOW WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. SPENSER WON'T TEND FOR HIM. SHEM HATES HIS GUTS. WHO IN THE HELL AM I GONNA PUT WITH HIM? THERE'S NOBODY I CAN PUT WITH HIM. Narrator: NOW THE SKIPPER AND HIS DAUGHTER ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT WILLING TO TEND FOR HIM... AT SOME POINT, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK ABOUT SCHEDULING. WHAT IS IT? I'M NOT TENDING FOR JASON ANYMORE. I'LL WORK WHATEVER SHIFT, HOWEVER MANY HOURS, BUT I'M NOT TENDING FOR HIM ANYMORE. I DON'T WANT TO WORK AROUND HIM, PERIOD. ...MAKE THAT JUST THE SKIPPER. I NEED YOU TO BE ON THIS SHIFT. LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO BE MISERABLE. I CAME UP HERE TO WORK AND TO, YOU KNOW, JUST -- RIGHT, AND THAT'S WHY I CALL IT "WORK," NOT "PLAY." I DON'T WANT TO WORK AROUND HIM, EITHER. ALL THIS NEGATIVITY HAS RUBBED OFF ON ME, AND I CAN FEEL IT. SO YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME DO IT? WE'VE GOT A JOB TO DO HERE, ELAINE. YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU ENJOY, OKAY? THIS IS THE SHIFT I NEED YOU TO BE ON. OKAY. YEP. Vern: I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE THE DAMN WHEELS GO ROUND, YOU KNOW? IF IT'S TENDING, I'LL TEND, BUT I GOT A BUSINESS TO RUN, TOO. ALL RIGHT, NOW TRY IT. UP. WHOA! [ GROANS ] Jason: ALL RIGHT? YEP. AAH. NO. JUST THE ICE. WHOA! I LANDED ON MY HEAD. I'M ALL RIGHT. Narrator: FOR VERNON, A DEMOTION TO TENDER IS A MATTER OF INSULT AND NOW ALSO INJURY. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT -- HIM GOING DOWN UNDER THE WATER. SOMETIMES I WISH HE WOULD STAY DOWN. SO YOU'RE HAVING THROTTLE ISSUES? YOU NEED IT RAMMED AGAIN? ALL RIGHT, THEN, [BLEEP] DAMN IT! I JUST ASKED YOU! I DIDN'T HEAR YOU THE FIRST [BLEEP] TIME! I'M SICK OF YOUR [BLEEP] JASON! Jason: ALL RIGHT, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO HAVE A TALK. YEAH, RIGHT! [BLEEP] DAMN RIGHT! ALL RIGHT. YOU -- MOTHER [BLEEP] [BLEEP] YOU! [BLEEP] WE CAN SHUT THIS MOTHER [BLEEP] DOWN! I'M TIRED OF YOUR [BLEEP] I CAN'T GET ANYBODY TO TEND FOR YOU, AND I AIN'T TENDING FOR YOU! [BLEEP] SHUT IT DOWN! I'M TIRED OF PUTTING UP WITH YOUR [BLEEP] YOU PISSED OFF EVERYBODY IN THIS [BLEEP] DAMN CREW WITH YOUR NEGATIVE BULL[BLEEP] JASON! EVERY WORD OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS NEGATIVE! Jason: OH, YEAH, IT'S ALL ME! A FEW MONTHS AGO, YOU WERE POSITIVE. NOW YOU'RE NEGATIVE. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY ON THE CREW IS A [BLEEP] BOMB. THEY'RE ALL AGAINST YOU. I'D HAVE FIRED EVERYBODY. RIGHT, AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ANYBODY TO WORK WITH. NO, YOU DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE INCOMPETENT OR NOT. THEY'RE NOT INCOMPETENT. YOU DON'T CARE. THEY'RE PUTTING MORE GOLD IN THE BOX THAN YOU ARE. THEY'RE NOT INCOMPETENT. RIGHT! SURE -- AFTER I LED THEM HERE! THIS IS A BIG AREA! ANYBODY CAN GO DOWN THERE AND [BLEEP] PULL SOME GOLD AFTER I LED THEM HERE, OKAY?! YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME! ANY [BLEEP] FOOL CAN GO DOWN THERE AND SUCK UP GOLD AFTER YOU LEAD THEM THERE, ALL RIGHT?! THIS IS MY SPOT, AND I BROUGHT YOU HERE! THOSE GUYS ARE RIGHT -- 100 YARDS FROM THERE. YEAH! LOOK WHERE THEY ARE! LOOK WHERE THEY ARE! THEY WORKED HERE LAST YEAR, TOO. YOU THINK IT'S BY CHANCE?! YOU THINK IT'S BY CHANCE? THEY'VE BEEN WORKING HERE 15 YEARS! OH, RIGHT, RIGHT! ELAINE, YOU JUST STAY OUT OF THIS. NOBODY CAN TAKE AWAY WHAT I DID. OH, YEAH, YOU'RE THE GREATEST, JASON. YOU'RE THE GREATEST. NOBODY. MAN, KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE. EVERYBODY ALREADY KNOWS. THAT YOU'RE A [BLEEP] NUT CASE? [BLEEP] DAMN IT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M [BLEEP] DOING?! JUST WHAT I SAID -- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! AS IN WHAT? AS IN ANYTHING! YOU'RE SO FULL OF [BLEEP] I AIN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DECIDE, OKAY? YOU'RE NOT GONNA SCARE ME. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING, BUT IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE A GOOD THING. Jason: HE'S AN IDIOT. HE'S AN IDIOT. NOW THAT I'VE BUILT THE OPERATION AND PUT HIM ON THE GOLD AND -- "NOW JASON CAN JUST GO NOW. WE DON'T NEED JASON ANYMORE." AND THAT'S JUST HIS MENTALITY AND THE MENTALITY OF HIS DAUGHTER. Vern: NEVER AGAIN. I'M DONE WITH HIM. I CAN'T TOLERATE THE MAN ANYMORE. ANYBODY CAN GO DOWN THERE AND [BLEEP] PULL SOME GOLD! [BLEEP] DO IT! KILL EACH OTHER, YOU [BLEEP] FIGHT, YOU [BLEEP] A COUPLE OF YELLOW BELLIES OVER THERE [BLEEP] TOUGH [BLEEP] SWAPPING [BLEEP] SPIT. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] NO WAY. THE QUIET ONES ARE ALWAYS THE DEADLY ONES. KILL HIM, JASON! THEY'RE STILL SCREAMING. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] I HOPE WE DON'T SOUND THAT BAD. WE DO SOUND THAT BAD. Jason: LOOK WHERE THEY ARE! I DON'T KNOW WHY WE TAKE PLEASURE OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MISFORTUNE, BUT [BLEEP] IT SURE BRIGHTENS UP OUR SPIRITS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? Narrator: ONE MILE EAST OF NOME HARBOR, AT THE EROICA... ROGER THAT. COMING HOME. ...EMILY SURFACES AFTER A SECOND TROUBLE-FREE DIVE... ...OFFICIALLY BACK IN THE SADDLE. GOOD JOB. YOU GOT YOUR CONFIDENCE BACK. WE LIKE IT. I SAW SOME GOLD. IT WAS GOOD TO SEE SOME [BLEEP] GOLD DOWN THERE. WHOO-HOO! HELL, YEAH! NICE. Emily: IT WAS GOOD. I WENT DOWN. I SAW SOME GOLD. AND I FEEL A LOT BETTER IN THE WATER. TODAY, I THINK I CONQUERED SOME OF THE DEMONS. AT FIRST, I WAS DEFINITELY PRETTY SHAKY, BUT ONCE I JUST STARTED FOCUSING ON MOVING MATERIAL, I FELT FINE. Daryl: IT WENT WELL. EMILY BEING ABLE TO GET BACK DOWN IN THE WATER TODAY WAS A GOOD THING. IT TAKES SOME OF THE STRAIN OFF OF TONY AND I AND PUT MORE GOLD IN THE BOX. IT'S A WIN-WIN-WIN ALL THE WAY AROUND. Emily: HEY, GUYS, I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS -- MASSIVE PICKER. LOOK AT IT. IT'S SO ROUND AND PRETTY. LOOK AT THAT. IT'S, LIKE -- IT'S PERFECT ROUND, ALMOST. OOH. IT'S HEAVY, TOO. SEXY, SEXY GOLD. Narrator: JUST ONE MILE AWAY AT THE MISS NOMER... HOW ARE YOU DOING, MY BABY? HUH? FEELING OKAY? ...AFTER ANOTHER SHIFT OF MINING WHERE HE'S BEEN TOLD TO MINE, ZEKE TENHOFF CALLS IT A DAY. IF YOU CAN WORK WITH GLEN, YOU CAN WORK WITH ANYONE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT GLEN WANTS FROM A PARTNER. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. GLEN FEELS CHALLENGED IF I STATE MY OWN OPINION. SOMETIMES, IT CAN BE... ANNOYING. IF HE'S GETTING REALLY FRUSTRATED ABOUT SOMETHING, THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT I CAN DO ABOUT THAT. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS AREA IS CONSISTENTLY RICH ENOUGH. IF WE WANT TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO OUR PLAN, THEN I'M REALLY OPEN TO THAT, BUT WHAT I'M NOT OPEN TO IS IF IT'S, LIKE, ELIMINATE ME AND MY OPINIONS FROM THE EQUATION COMPLETELY. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. Narrator: BACK IN TOWN, AT VERNON ADKISON'S TRAILER... HOW'S THE GOLD? ...IT'S TIME TO WEIGH SOME METAL. YEA-YEAH! [ CHUCKLES ] NEWLY FIRED DIVER JASON WALKER HAS TURNED UP TO COLLECT HIS SHARE OF THE BOUNTY. YEAH, THIS IS MY LAST CLEANOUT ON THE RANGER. AND A BIG CLEANOUT IT IS. IT'S JUST NOT GONNA BE THIS GOOD AGAIN! [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME JASON AND I HAVE PARTED COMPANY. AND THIS TIME...NO MORE. THIS IS IT. FINITO. IT'S -- NEVER AGAIN. I MADE SOME GOOD MONEY, YOU KNOW? WASN'T NEARLY AS MUCH AS I WANTED, BUT WHAT I'VE PROVEN TO MYSELF MAKES UP FOR IT. VERN USES PEOPLE. AND WHEN HE FEELS HE CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT USING YOU OR NEEDING YOU ANYMORE, HE'LL TOSS YOU TO THE WIND. Narrator: WITH HIS CREW PUTTING ANOTHER 70 HOURS ON THE BOX... Vern: 0.83. NOW THE FINE GOLD FROM THE BACK OF THE BOX. ...VERNON NEEDS TO SEE BIG GOLD ON THE SCALE TO STAY ON TRACK FOR A 200-OUNCE SEASON. NOW, THIS IS THE MAIN LOAD. 4.76... ...0.83, 1.6, 31.58. GRAND TOTAL IS... ...38.77 OUNCES. WHOO! NICE. WHOO! YEAH. Narrator: 38.77 OUNCES IS WORTH A MASSIVE $50,400. ALL RIGHT, POP THE CHAMPAGNE, ELAINE. WHAT IS THAT? 39 OUNCES IN 68 HOURS. I'M LOVING IT.
