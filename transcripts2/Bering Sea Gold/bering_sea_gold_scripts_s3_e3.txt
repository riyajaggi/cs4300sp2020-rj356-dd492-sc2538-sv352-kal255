 THE WINTER MINING SEASON IS KICKING INTO HIGH GEAR. WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR A 300-OUNCE SEASON HERE, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SHOOTING FOR. I THINK WE CAN DO IT. Shawn: PUT A LOT OF GOLD IN THE BOX IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, AND WE JUST KEEP MOVING TOWARDS WHERE WE SEE MORE AND MORE GOLD, AND HOPEFULLY, WE FIND THAT BIG-ASS PUDDLE DOWN THERE. Narrator: CREWS ARE FIGHTING IT OUT FOR THE BEST GROUNDS... THE KELLYS -- PRACTICALLY RIGHT ON TOP OF US. LET THEM GO FIND THEIR OWN AREA. Narrator: ...AND FIGHTING JUST TO KEEP THEIR DREDGES UP AND RUNNING. I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALREADY BLOWN AN INSANE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THIS PROJECT. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE. IT DOESN'T MATTER YOUR PREPARATION.

 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. NOME IS NOME, AND NOME IS WHERE CHAOS IS BREWED AND DISTRIBUTED. Narrator: WITH SPRING ONLY A MONTH AWAY, IT'S A SCRAMBLE TO GET THE GOLD WHILE THE GETTING STAYS GOOD. Glen: WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN HERE. IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME BECAUSE THE SHEET'S GONNA GO OUT, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF TOWN ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... MY GOAL IS TO KICK EVERYBODY'S ASS AS MUCH AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. I'M GONNA STACK AS MUCH GOLD UP AS POSSIBLE. Narrator: FOUR DAYS AGO... WHOO! Narrator: MR. GOLD, SHAWN POMRENKE'S FIRST CLEAN-UP OF THE WINTER... 30.95 OUNCES. ...WORTH OVER $40,000 PUT HIM IN SECOND PLACE ON THE LEADER BOARD. I HATE GETTING SECOND PLACE. I DON'T LIKE SECOND PLACE. MY GOAL IS 150. WE'RE AT, LIKE, 30, BUT I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE A PILE OF GOLD AT THE END OF IT, AND WE'RE GONNA BE WEIGHING STUFF IN POUNDS AND NOT OUNCES. Narrator: NEXT UP TO HEAD UNDER THE ICE... YEAH, RIGHT. WILL IT FIT? ...VETERAN DIVER CODY MOEN. HOLY [BLEEP] CODY, YOU PUT ON MORE THAN FIVE POUNDS. [ LAUGHS ] SHOULDERS BACK. SHAWN'S, SHALL WE SAY... ATTABOY! ...A HEAVY HITTER. [ Scottish accent ] I'M SO SEXY! GET IN MY BELLY! YEAH, CODY ATE WELL THIS WINTER. SO HE'S WORKING THAT OFF NOW. [ GRUNTS ] UH-OH. IS THAT A NEW STRAP? DID I GET THAT FAT? [ LAUGHS ] I THINK IT GOT SHORTENED UP. Shawn: [ Normal voice ] YOU NEED AN EXTENSION? JUST PUT THAT [BLEEP] AROUND YOUR ANKLE. CODY, YOU'LL NEVER GET THIS [BLEEP] BACK ON. HOLY [BLEEP] JUST DON'T LET IT OUT. [ LAUGHS ] [BLEEP] I'M GONNA HAVE TO SET UP A WEIGHT BELT JUST FOR CODY. [ GRUNTS ] OH [BLEEP] I'M BARELY ABLE TO SINK HERE. HOW YOU FEELING? [ Laughs ] Narrator: AFTER AN EXTENDED DESCENT, CODY FINALLY GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS. Cody: I'M GONNA HEAD OVER TO WHERE SHAWN WAS KIND OF WORKING LAST. SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING. Shawn: I WAS SEEING REALLY GOOD GOLD AT THE END OF THE HOSE. SO WE DECIDED TO MOVE ABOUT 50 FEET. NOW WE'RE RIGHT ON TOP OF IT, AND THEN WE FOLLOW IT FROM THERE, BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET CODY IN A BIG [BLEEP] PILE OF GOLD. Cody: FEELS KIND OF COBBLE-Y OVER HERE TO THE EAST END. I'M NOT SEEING ANY COLOR YET. YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO KIND OF START TELLING HOW WE WERE WORKING BY THE CUT. YEAH. IT'S JUST NOTHING. THERE'S NO GOLD ANYWHERE HERE. NOT SEEING ANYTHING. [ GRUNTS ] I LOST MY WEIGHT BELT, MAN. I'M FLOATING. OH. I'M STUCK UP ON THE ICE. I'M LITERALLY [BLEEP] UPSIDE DOWN. Narrator: THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE OF CODY'S EXTRA POUNDS? OH [BLEEP] Narrator: BUOYANCY. Cody: [ CHUCKLES ] TRY TO GRAB A ROCK OR SOMETHING AND GET YOUR ASS BACK TO THE HOLE. OH [BLEEP] ALL RIGHT, I GOT THE WEIGHT BELT -- JUST BARELY GOT IT IN MY HAND. GONNA TRY TO GET TO THE LADDER HERE. OH [BLEEP] OH, YEAH, FEELS LIKE I GOT A BIG ONE! I GOT A [BLEEP] BIG ONE! UH-OH. THAT WAS FUNNY. YOU SEE ME FLOATING THERE? YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] THE STRAP DON'T QUITE FIT INTO THE CLIP HERE ON THE WEIGHT BELT. THAT SUCKED. Narrator: THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN BEING TOO HEAVY FOR YOUR DIVE BELT -- COMING UP LIGHT ON GOLD. Cody: CHECKED A LOT OF GROUND. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF STUFF, BUT NOTHING EVEN WORTH TALKING ABOUT. WELL, WE PUT A COUPLE OUNCES IN THE BOX, ANYWAY, SO... EVERYBODY'S RUNNING RAGGED AROUND HERE. THIS MOVING'S HARD ON A GUY. THEN TRYING TO DIVE, MOVE, DIVE, MOVE, DIVE -- IT'S REALLY HARD ON A GUY. Narrator: WITH ANOTHER DIVE HOLE TURNING OUT A BUST, MR. GOLD MUST PLOT HIS NEXT MOVE. BACK ON CLAIM 14... AT THE EROICA. Emily: PUMPS ARE RUNNING. ALL WE CAN DO IS GET THE DIVER IN THE WATER, AND THEN WE'LL BE SEEING IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE ANY PROGRESS WITH THE DRAGON SLAYER. Narrator: EMILY RIEDEL HAS HER PROTOTYPE UNDERWATER DREDGE, THE DRAGON SLAYER, BACK UP AND RUNNING. THE SYSTEM IS STILL GETTING DIALED IN. IT'S PRETTY NEW TO US. WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF BAD DAYS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS ICE SEASON. Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO... ...THE DRAGON SLAYER'S FIRST RUN WAS CUT SHORT DUE TO A LACK OF SUCTION. AFTER DROPPING ANOTHER 1,000 BUCKS ON A STRONGER PUMP ENGINE, IT'S TIME FOR ROUND TWO. THE FAILURE THAT IS INEVITABLE WITH THE PURSUIT OF MINING, YOUR EQUIPMENT NOT WORKING, IT CAN EITHER TURN YOU INTO A MONSTER OR IT CAN TURN YOU INTO A HIGHLY MOTIVATED HUMAN BEING JUST, LIKE, PRESSING ON TO TRY TO FIND GOLD. TIME TO GET TO WORK, BROTHER. IT'S SHOWTIME. Narrator: TESTING OUT THE NEW SYSTEM... IT'S TONY'S FIRST DIVE UNDER THE ICE. ...ROOKIE ICE DIVER TONY MANN. LOWER YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE. YEAH, JUST [BLEEP] JUST BREATHE AND CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT? YOU KNOW, IT'S [BLEEP] GOLD MINING. IT'S NOT [BLEEP] LIFE AND DEATH. I'M STILL GREEN. I'M GREEN AS A FREAKING CUCUMBER. I SEE THAT ICE HOLE, THE ANXIETY KIND OF GOES OFF A LITTLE BIT. BREATHE DEEP. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] IT'S CAVE DIVING. SO, I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- ONE WAY IN, ONE WAY OUT. PUT YOUR CHIN UP. GO SUCK SOME GOLD. OH. IT'S [BLEEP] UNSETTLING DIVING UNDER THE ICE FOR YOUR FIRST TIME. IT'S DANGEROUS FOR THE DIVER DOWN THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA LINES AND HOSES. [ GRUNTS ] ON BOTTOM. EM, THIS IS CRAZY. WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BEING UNDER THE ICE, TONES? SO, HOW'S THE SUCTION? ALL RIGHT. I'M MAKING MY WAY TO THE NOZZLE. Narrator: WITH THE CLOCK TICKING ON THE WINTER SEASON, EMILY NEEDS THE NEW PUMP TO DELIVER. Tony: THIS DRAGON SLAYER SUCKS PRETTY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. Emily: YEAH, BOY! OUR MAIN PUMP ENGINE'S WORKING. WE GOT ENOUGH SUCTION, FINALLY. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET SOME GOLD. WHAT DO YOU THINK? Tony: SO FAR, SO GOOD. WE JUST GOT TO SEE WHAT'S UNDER THESE ROCKS. [ GRUNTS ] AH, LOOKY THERE. ARE YOU SEEING SOME GOLD? YEAH. WHOO-HOO! OH! I NEVER HAD A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT YOU'D [BLEEP] GET OVER WHATEVER NERVOUSNESS YOU HAD. HERE'S MY "I JUST SAW A BIG NUGGET" FACE. [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE LOOKING FOR IT, TONY. Emily: JUST CHECKING OUT THE BOX, SEEING HOW THE MATERIAL IS GOING THROUGH IT. HEY! [ Chuckling ] OH. THAT'S GOLD. [ STUTTERED BREATHING ] Tony: HANG ON A BIT. FEELS LIKE IT'S [BLEEP] STARTING TO GO. HOLD ON. [ BREATHING SHARPLY ] YEP. DARYL, PULL ME UP! UP! DARYL, PULL ME UP! PULL ME UP! Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME AT THE EROICA... HANG ON A BIT. FEELS LIKE IT'S [BLEEP] STARTING TO GO. HOLD ON. [ BREATHES SHARPLY ] YEP. DARYL, PULL ME UP! UP! DARYL, PULL ME UP! Narrator: IN THE 25-DEGREE WATER, DIVER TONY MANN'S REGULATOR HAS FROZEN, LEAVING HIM WITH ONLY SECONDS OF AIR. PULL ME UP! PULL ME UP! COMING UP. DARYL, PULL ME UP! [ GRUNTS ] Emily: COME ON, NOW. GET UP. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOOD? YOU'RE GOOD, MAN. YOU'RE UP. MY [BLEEP] REGULATOR FROZE. Tony: I WAS HALFWAY THROUGH THE BREATH, AND IT WENT. BEFORE I KNEW IT, DARYL STARTED [BLEEP] PULLING ME OUT. I HAD ABOUT TWO BREATHS BEFORE THE SURFACE, AND ON THAT LAST BREATH, IT COMPLETELY SUCKED MY FACE. Emily: THERE'S NO FEELING MORE TERRIFYING. REGULATOR FREEZES. YOU THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD CAUSE THEM AND EXACERBATE THEM, AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK. Narrator: ALREADY DEEP IN DEBT ON EQUIPMENT, EMILY IS FACING YET ANOTHER SETBACK. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GETTING WATER. THIS WATER LINE MIGHT BE STARTING TO FREEZE, YOU GUYS. I'M FEELING A LOT OF PRESSURE. LIKE, IT MIGHT BE TRYING TO PUSH UP ICE OR SOMETHING. THE PROBLEM THIS TIME -- NO, IT'S CLOGGED COMPLETELY WITH ICE. ...A BUILDUP OF ICE IN THE LINE CARRYING HOT WATER TO THE REGULATOR. SO, WE GOT TO PULL THE PUMP BACK OUT NOW AND GET THIS WARMED UP. GOD! IT'S OKAY, EM. WE'LL GET IT. Emily: AND I JUST DROPPED 50 GRAND ON AN OPERATION THAT IS NOT REMOTELY CLOSE TO PAYING FOR IT, SO... Narrator: AS EMILY'S OPERATION CONTINUES TO FALTER, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF CLAIM 14 AT THE MISS NOMER... .68. NOT EVEN THREE-QUARTERS. OH, DUDE. IT'S TIME TO MOVE, FOR SURE. ...AFTER PULLING 16 OUNCES, WORTH NEARLY $21,000, FROM THEIR FIRST SPOT... WE'VE DONE WELL HERE. WE CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW WE'VE DONE. IT'S BEEN GOOD TO US, BUT IT'S DWINDLING. ...GLEN LeBARON AND PARTNER ZEKE TENHOFF ARE IN NEED OF SOME FRESH GROUND. REMEMBER LAST FALL WHEN WE WENT OUT IN THOSE NASTY STORMS? LIKE, I PUT MY FACE DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, AND THERE'S GOLD JUST, LIKE, EXPOSED ON THE CLAIM. MM-HMM. YEP. YEAH. [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S ABOUT TIME WE MOVED TO 12. THIS IS THE LAST STRAW. LET'S PACK UP AND GET OUT OF HERE. ZEKE AND I, WE DREDGED 14. YOU KNOW, THE GOLD SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE BIT. WE WANT TO PUT AS MUCH GOLD IN THE BOX AS POSSIBLE. Narrator: THE PLAN -- A HALF-MILE MOVE FROM CLAIM 14 TO CLAIM 12, A SPOT THEY'VE ATTEMPTED TO WORK JUST ONCE BEFORE. Zeke: THE OPERATION GLEN AND I HAVE RIGHT NOW, IT'S HIGHLY MOBILE. WE BOTH KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING, WE KNOW WHAT GOOD GOLD LOOKS LIKE, AND WE CAN MOVE AROUND QUICKLY. WE'RE GONNA GO OUT TO KIND OF A MORE UNEXPLORED AREA AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME NEW CHALLENGES AT THIS NEW LOCATION BECAUSE OF THE DEPTH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL, HAVE MORE SAFETY HOLES. Narrator: WITH THE NEW CLAIM COMES A NEW DANGER. Zeke: WE WEREN'T VERY DEEP OVER THERE ON OUR LAST SPOT. I THINK WE WERE ONLY LIKE 15, 16 FEET. THIS IS ABOUT 30. SO, WE'RE IN DANGER OF BUILDING UP A LOT OF NITROGEN, AND THERE'S NO DECOMPRESSION CHAMBERS IN NOME. Zeke: IT'S DEFINITELY NOT IDEAL, BUT FOR THE GOLD, I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH IT. Narrator: WHILE GLEN AND ZEKE RUSH TO GET BACK IN THE WATER... EIGHT MILES TO THE WEST ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... THE GARBAGE TIN CAN BLEW A COMPRESSOR. ...THE KELLY FAMILY IS WORKING TO GET THEIR AIR COMPRESSOR BACK ONLINE. WHAT HAPPENED WAS IT SHEARED OFF A PIN ON THE INSIDE OF THE PISTON. SO IT'S ONLY TURNING ON ONE SIDE. CAUSED IT TO OVERHEAT. SOMETIMES YOU JUST CAN'T WIN FOR LOSING. Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO... NOW! ...OWNER BRAD KELLY'S CHEAP EQUIPMENT NEARLY COST HIM HIS SECOND-BORN SON. HEY! READY TO GO. I'M GONNA PUT IT BACK TOGETHER. Narrator: BRAD'S SOLUTIONS -- MORE USED PARTS. OKAY, WE'RE ALL READY. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] OUR OPERATION RUNS FOR ABOUT LESS THAN $100 A DAY. PROFIT-WISE, IT'S THE BEST IT'S EVER BEEN FOR ME. MY DAD DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON ANYTHING -- NO PROSPECTING, NO UPGRADES, ANYTHING, BECAUSE DAD'S GOT HIS NEW FAMILY. Narrator: FOR THE BOYS, THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN DAD HOARDING THE PROFITS IS WHO HE'S BEEN SPENDING THEM ON. THERE'S THE LITTLE WOMAN RIGHT THERE -- THE NEW ADDITION TO THE FAMILY -- COURTNEY. Kris: WE NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK FOR A COUPLE SECONDS ABOUT HOW THE GOLD IS BEING DISTRIBUTED. WE NEED TO START PUTTING IT INTO THE DREDGE. I KNOW HOW WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM. YOU DIVE FOUR MORE HOURS A DAY, AND THAT'LL PICK UP THE SLACK. HOW ABOUT YOU STOP BUYING YOUR NEW KIDS ALL KINDS OF TOYS, YOUR NEW FAMILY ALL KINDS OF -- LITTLE KIDS NEED TOYS. I DIDN'T NEED THEM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID. STOP [BLEEP] OUR DREDGING MONEY AWAY ON YOUR NEW FAMILY. I'M NOT PISSING MONEY AWAY. IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND. NO, IT ISN'T IN MY MIND. I CAN SEE IT. YOU'RE SPENDING OUR DREDGING MONEY ON YOUR NEW FAMILY. AND THESE KIDS, YOU KNOW, IT'S STILL A LOT OF ANIMOSITY. I MET A NEW WOMAN IN NOME, WAS A WAITRESS. AND WHAT CAN YOU SAY? I TOLD MY WIFE TO COME HERE IN THE BEGINNING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NOW I BET SHE WISHED SHE WOULD'VE COME. COURTNEY'S CLOSET'S FULL OF [BLEEP] THAT YOU BOUGHT HER NEW. LIKE WHAT? JACKETS, SHOES, MAKEUP. THAT'S HOW YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR GIRL HAPPY. WELL, YOU NEED TO STOP BUYING HER [BLEEP] LOOKIT! ARE WE READY TO GO? ARE WE READY TO SHUT UP? OKAY, I GOT TO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S CONSTANT ARGUING. THESE [BLEEP] SNIVELER WHINERS. KRIS, HE WAKES UP WITH A PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT SHOULD BE ON MEDS 24/7 -- SOMETHING REAL POWERFUL FOR NUT JOBS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? Kris: MY DAD'S STARTING THIS NEW FAMILY. HE COMES TO NOME AND RUINS EVERYONE'S LIFE OVER IT. HE WANTS TO TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING HE'S DOING WHATSOEVER. JUST DO IT. LET'S GO. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ALASKA... ON CLAIM 12... REALLY, EVERYTHING'S PUT TOGETHER, IT'S READY TO RUN, AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO DIVE. FIRST DIVE HOLE OF OUR NEW SPOT. Narrator: ...ZEKE AND GLEN ARE READY TO EXPLORE THE NEW GROUNDS. I'M JUST MEASURING OUT 30 FEET ON THIS PIECE OF STRING, AND I'M GONNA DROP IT DOWN IN THE HOLE AND SEE WHAT KIND OF DEPTH WE'RE ACTUALLY IN. Narrator: TO FIND THEIR FORTUNE, THEY'LL HAVE TO GO DEEPER UNDER THE ICE. WE'RE KIND OF IN THE GRAY AREA OF GETTING THE BENDS. YOU KNOW, THE BENDS IS WHERE YOU GET SO MUCH NITROGEN IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM, YOU CAN'T JUST ASCEND AS FAST AS YOU WANT BECAUSE THE NITROGEN BUBBLES EXPAND AND WILL ACTUALLY BLOCK OFF YOUR BLOODSTREAM, AND IT COULD KILL YOU. Zeke: WELL, THIS IS 30 FEET RIGHT HERE. YEAH, THAT'S ABOUT 2 FEET. SO WE'RE AT ABOUT 28 FEET. Glen: SO, IT'S A REAL DEAL. WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. PRETTY SPOOKY DIVING THIS DEEP. IT'D TAKE A LOT LONGER TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE IF YOU NEED TO. BE SAFE. I'LL GO LISTEN TO YOU ON THE COMM. OKAY. Narrator: FIRST TO TAKE THE PLUNGE -- GLEN LeBARON, THE SELF-PROCLAIMED BEST DREDGER IN NOME. AT 28 FEET BELOW THE ICE, THE PRESSURE PER SQUARE INCH IS NEARLY DOUBLE THAT AT SEA LEVEL. THE LONGER GLEN DIVES AT DEPTH, THE MORE PRESSURIZED NITROGEN WILL BUILD UP IN HIS BLOODSTREAM AND THE GREATER THE RISK OF DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS. Glen: THIS IS DEFINITELY THE DIVE OF RECKONING. I'VE GOT TO SEE AT LEAST A HALF OUNCE AN HOUR TO CONTINUE DREDGING DOWN HERE. IT'S JUST TOO RISKY. SO, IS THERE ANY HARDPAN LAYER WHERE YOU'RE WORKING? THERE IS. AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THESE GRAVELS ARE SO RICH. SEVERAL LAYERS OF GRAVEL HERE. THERE'S A GRAY LAYER AND THERE'S THIS RUSTY... OH, WOW. ALL RIGHT. THIS GRAVEL'S JUST ABSOLUTELY SATURATED WITH GOLD. AWESOME. I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT WE'RE BACK ON IT AND WE'RE SEEING GOOD GOLD. YEAH. I'M GLAD THAT -- I'M GLAD WE'RE HERE. Narrator: AS THE MOVE TO CLAIM 12 STARTS PAYING OFF FOR THE MISS NOMER, BACK IN TOWN... AT VERNON ADKINSON'S TRAILER... FINGERS AND TOES CROSSED AND KNOCKING ON WOOD. Narrator: ...THE WILD RANGER OWNER IS PANNING OUT HIS SECOND CLEAN-OUT OF THE YEAR. THAT LOOKED PRETTY DAMN GOOD TO ME. SO FAR THIS SEASON, VERNON'S FIRST HAUL NETTED $42,000 AND PUT HIM AT THE TOP OF THE GOLD COUNT. 32.6. RIGHT. Narrator: HIS ONLY PROBLEM... NO, HE'S CHALLENGING ME AT EVERY MOMENT. JUST QUIT BEING SO DAMN SENSITIVE, FOR GOD SAKES! ...THE ENORMOUS EGO OF CREW CHIEF JASON WALKER. I PROBABLY DID THE BEST ON THIS BOX. THIS SPLIT'S GONNA BE BASED ON HOURS. I THINK IF YOU GO BY HOURS, IT WOULD PROBABLY CREATE A MORE TEAM-LIKE ATMOSPHERE. WELL, I DO BETTER WITH LESS HOURS, OKAY? I DO BETTER THAN EVERYBODY SO FAR WITH LESS HOURS, AND I'M NOT TAKING A CUT FROM THAT, OKAY? I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO GO DOWN THERE AND COMPETE WITH THEIR SIX HOURS WHEN I CAN DO MORE IN FOUR. THEY CAN'T COMPETE WITH ME. IT'S JUST A LACK OF EXPERIENCE. WHO ON THIS TEAM HAS LACK OF EXPERIENCE? ARE YOU SAYING YOU MIGHT HAVE A LACK OF EXPERIENCE? I'M NOT SURE. ALL RIGHT, COME ON. NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO CALL YOU OUT. I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE, WHO HAS LACK OF EXPERIENCE HERE? I THINK WE ALL ARE PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME LEVEL. THINK WE CAN MOVE SOME [BLEEP] GROUND. YOU'RE THE MANAGER. BE MANAGERIAL. WHY'S EVERYONE SECOND-GUESSING ME, THEN? BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- IT'S ALREADY BEEN PROVEN. WHY DON'T YOU STEP UP AND SAY THAT WE ALREADY PROVED THAT JASON DOES MORE IN LESS TIME? SAY IT, AND THAT'LL BE THE END OF IT. DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO [BLEEP] SAY! LISTEN, JUST CALM DOWN! JUST CALM DOWN. JUST BEAR WITH ME FOR ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. 20-SOMETHINGS, AND... JASON, PLEASE, JUST BEAR WITH ME. I'M GETTING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED AND I NEED -- I NEED A BREAK. I'LL STILL OUT-PRODUCE HIM, TOO. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE [BLEEP] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TO PLEASE THAT GUY. Jason: THAT'S JUST INSANE. THAT'S INSANE TO WANT TO SHARE A BOX WITH SOME LAGGING-BEHIND DIVERS. Vernon: WE'LL PAY EVERYBODY BY THE HOUR, AND I'LL REACH SOME ACCOMMODATION WITH HIM. TRYING TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. Narrator: THE BEST REMEDY FOR AN ANGRY CREW? ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. SEE WHAT ALL THIS HARD WORK PAID OFF TO BE. GOLD ON THE SCALE. Vernon: COME ON, BABY. PRETTY NICE LITTLE PILE OF GOLD. Narrator: 28 OUNCES OF GOLD. THAT'S $36,000. WELL, GOOD. BIG OL' SMILES ON OUR FACES. THE GOLD IS SO GOOD. BUT THE CREW MAY LEAVE ME BECAUSE OF JASON, AND I MADE UP MY MIND A WHILE BACK. BEFORE THAT WOULD HAPPEN, I'D GET RID OF JASON. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... AT THE REAPER... HEY, KRIS. HOW'S THE GOLD GOING? WITH A JURY-RIGGED AIR COMPRESSOR, BRAD KELLY'S DIME-STORE DREDGE IS BACK IN BUSINESS, AND HIS SON, KRIS, IS MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME. I GOT A FEELING THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S GONNA PAY OFF FOR US. Narrator: AS DIVER, KRIS TAKES A HEALTHY CUT OF THE DAY'S GOLD. I KNOW. BUT HIS FATHER, BRAD, HE WANTS A BIGGER PIECE OF THE ACTION. DAD'S GETTING READY TO GO DOWN. WHAT THE [BLEEP] Narrator: BRAD'S OWNER'S SHARE IS ALREADY HALF OF THE GOLD. ADDING A DIVER'S CUT GIVES HIM THE LION'S SHARE. MY FIRST DIVE UNDER THE ICE. GOOD GOLD. I WANT TO GET A PIECE OF THIS PIE. ♪ DA-DA-DA-DA-DAA I'M READY. KRIS THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA HAVE A GOOD DAY, BUT I'M GONNA GO DOWN AND STIR UP HIS [BLEEP] GOLD FOR HIM. SHOW THESE YOUNG GUYS HOW IT'S REALLY DONE. THIS ISN'T MY FIRST RODEO. WHEN YOU GO ON YOUR WAY UP TO THE TOP, DOES IT MATTER ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE YOU GOT TO STEP ON TO GET THERE [Laughing] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, DUDE? I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA BE DOWN THERE DOING SOME WORK AND NOT JUST [BLEEP] TRYING TO TAKE A BIGGER PERCENTAGE OF MY GOLD. Kris: MY DAD'S GONNA PRETEND TO DO SOME DREDGING, MAYBE STAND ON THE HOSE AND MOVE IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT JUST TO GET MORE GOLD FROM ME. YOU KNOW, HE [BLEEP] CAN'T LET ME GET ANYTHING. EVERY LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW? Kris: ANDY, GO LOOK AT THE BOX AND SEE IF HE'S EVEN [BLEEP] PUTTING ANY MATERIAL THROUGH IT. I DON'T EVEN HEAR ANY ROCKS COMING UP. YEAH. [BLEEP] HIM. ARE YOU STILL WORKING? I'M NOT SEEING ANY MATERIAL COME UP YET. THERE IS NO MATERIAL COMING UP THIS [BLEEP] SLUICE BOX AT ALL. THERE'S NOT EVEN SAND. LOOK AT THAT [BLEEP] HE'S SITTING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE. I'M NOT [BLEEP] PULLING YOU UP. PULL ME UP, YOU [BLEEP] LAZY BASTARDS. I'M NOT PULLING HIM UP! WHAT THE [BLEEP] OH, HE'S ON HIS WAY UP. OH, WHATEVER. Andy: YOU KNOW, IT WAS KIND OF [BLEEP] UP, REALLY. HE GETS SUITED UP, DIPS IN THE WATER, AND COMES RIGHT BACK UP. WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. MY DAD, HE JUST WANTS TO MESS AROUND. HE DOESN'T WANT TO DIVE, HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO BE OUT THERE WITH US, BUT HE WANTS HIS GOLD. HERE HE IS -- THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND! YEAH, I CALLED THAT [BLEEP] 10 MINUTES. Narrator: BRAD RESURFACES AFTER AN EXHAUSTING 10 MINUTES. NOT ENOUGH TO ADD TO THE BOX... ...BUT MORE THAN ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM A DIVER'S CUT FOR THE DAY. Brad: READY TO ROLL. I GOT TO GO AND TAKE CARE OF THIS -- THIS PRENATAL [BLEEP] I'LL BE BACK. Kris: THAT'S BULL[BLEEP] LOOK AT THIS JACKASS. THAT'S IT. TOOK OFF. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO EXPECT. [ SIGHS ] YEAH, GO TEAM. Narrator: WHILE BAD BRAD HEADS BACK TO TOWN... ...EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST... ...ON CLAIM 12... Zeke: IF THE GOLD IS GOOD, I THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OUT HERE. AND GLEN'S BEEN AT IT ALL DAY. IT'S GONNA STACK UP FAST. Narrator: ...ZEKE TENHOFF CAREFULLY MONITORS DIVER GLEN LeBARON, DREDGING 28 FEET UNDER THE ICE. Zeke: HOW'S IT GOING? Glen: KEEPING TRACK OF MY NITROGEN. WE CAN'T MESS AROUND AT THIS DEPTH. WE'RE DEFINITELY IN THE GRAY ZONE OF WHAT WE CAN DO SAFELY. OKAY, I'M COMING UP RIGHT NOW, ZEKE. YEAH. WE SHOULD TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES JUST, AND, LIKE, YOU KNOW, GO VERY, VERY SLOW. YEP. Narrator: AFTER SIX HOURS DREDGING AT DEPTH, GLEN'S RETURN TO THE SURFACE MUST BE CAREFULLY EXECUTED TO AVOID POTENTIALLY FATAL DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS. Glen: OF COURSE, I WANT TO TAKE MY TIME. I'VE BEEN DOWN HERE AT LEAST SIX HOURS TODAY. I GOT TO GO EXTRA SLOW. ALL RIGHT. I'M AT 20 FEET. I'M GONNA STAY HERE AT 20 FEET FOR A FEW BREATHS TO MAKE SURE... I DON'T GET A CARBONATED BLOODSTREAM. Narrator: SAFETY STOPS RELIEVE THE BODY OF DEADLY NITROGEN GAS. Glen: ALL RIGHT. GOING UP SLOWLY. I'M GONNA STOP AT 10 FEET. JUST GONNA HANG OUT HERE FOR A FEW BREATHS. OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA BE SEEING ME AT THE SURFACE HERE IN ABOUT THREE SECONDS. WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT AN EASY SCENARIO. WE'RE 30 FEET DOWN HERE. WE CAN'T SEE HARDLY IN FRONT OF OUR FACE, BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF GOLD. EVERY TIME I WALK ANYWHERE, THERE'S SOMEBODY CALLING ME MR. GOLD. MY DREDGING NICKNAME IS TENACIOUS G. [ LAUGHS ] THE PRICK. THE GOLD HOUND, 'CAUSE I CAN SMELL IT. [ SNIFFS ] [ HOWLS ] GOLD DADDY. I'VE NEVER BEEN A PERSON TO TAKE NICKNAMES -- EVER. MR. NICE GUY. LAZY [BLEEP] THE PIRATE, 'CAUSE I'M A SHADY [BLEEP] DUDE. I THINK IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE YOURSELF A NICKNAME. Narrator: IN NOME... AFTER ANOTHER FIVE DAYS OF TOIL, MINERS HAVE EARNED THE CHANCE TO TALLY UP THEIR GOLD TAKES. DUDE, I'D TAKE 1/10 OF AN OUNCE AN HOUR [BLEEP] RIGHT NOW OVER NOTHING. Narrator: THAT IS, IF THEY'VE MANAGED TO RECOVER ANY GOLD AT ALL. Emily: I'M SO [BLEEP] SICK OF THIS [BLEEP] Narrator: EMILY RIEDEL WILL HAVE TO THAW HER WATER LINES BEFORE DREDGING CAN SAFELY RESUME. ALL RIGHT, DUDE. GONNA HAVE TO START DOING THIS EVERY DAY. BRINGING THE HOT-WATER HEATER OFF THE ICE, STORING IT IN A HEATED PLACE, AND THEN BRING IT BACK OUT, AND I [BLEEP] HOPE IT DOESN'T RE-FREEZE ON THE WAY OUT. SHOULDN'T. Daryl: IT WON'T. BUT GIVEN OUR LUCK, YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS? ACROSS TOWN AT THE KELLY HOUSE... THE BOND BETWEEN A FATHER AND THE SON IS THICK. ...AFTER THEIR DAD DOVE FOR 10 MINUTES JUST TO TAKE GOLD FROM THEIR POCKETS... ...KRIS AND ANDY HAVE CALLED IN THE BIG GUN. HELLO? HI, DEE. HOW'S IT GOING? MOM. DEE, WHY ARE YOU SO HOSTILE? DON'T BE SO HATEFUL. NO, SHE'S NOT RIGHT HERE. THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE IS MY MOTHER. WE'RE LIKE THE BEST OF FRIENDS. SO I DESPISE MY FATHER BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID TO MY MOTHER. DID YOU WANT ME TO SEND YOU MONEY? HOW MUCH? A HONDO? WILL THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY? OH, MY GOD. DID YOU SAY 5 BUCKS? DEE, I CAN'T DO THAT. I CAN'T [BLEEP] DO THAT. FIRST OF ALL, THE BANK'S CLOSED. IT'S 4:00 HERE. BANK'S OPEN TILL WHAT, 6:00? PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN YOUR HEART, DEE. COME ON. WELL... YOU CAN BE A LITTLE NICER. AND YOU GOT TO QUIT TALKING BAD ABOUT ME. IF I SEND MONEY, YOU GOT TO TALK -- LET ME HEAR YOU SAY SOMETHING NICE TO ME RIGHT NOW. DEE: [Bleep] you. [ SNICKERS ] THANKS. I AM SCARED OF MY FATHER. I REALLY AM. MY DAD'S DEVIOUS, GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO HURT PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE HIM WRONG. MM... [ SIGHS ] OKAY, HONEST TO GOD, THE TRUTH? Man: YEAH. MY DAD HAS NOBODY ELSE IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE. HE'S [BLEEP] HAD US SINCE HE'S BEEN 16 YEARS OLD. HE'S KEPT US CLOSE GUARDED HIS ENTIRE LIFE, NEVER LET US STAY AT ANYONE'S HOUSE. [BLEEP] ALWAYS MOVED AROUND. WE'VE BEEN STUCK WITH HIM 90% OF OUR LIFE. DON'T ASK ME WHY. WE'RE WEIRDO PEOPLE. WE STICK WITH OUR [BLEEP] WEIRDO FAMILY, AND WE ALL SEEM TO GO DOWN IN THE SAME SHIP TOGETHER. Narrator: OUT ON CLAIM 12... Glen: ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST ABOUT TO DROP OUT THE NUGGET SECTION. Narrator: ...GLEN LeBARON HAS RETURNED TO THE DEEP TO CLEAN OUT THE DRAGON AND CHECK THE YIELD. Glen: LET'S SEE WHAT'S IN HERE. Narrator: THE DRAGON'S TWO-STAGE RECOVERY SYSTEM MEANS THERE'S ONE SLUICE BOX FOR COARSE GOLD AND ONE FOR FINE. Glen: ONLY TIME YOU SEE A LOT OF GOLD ON TOP OF THE MAT IS WHEN YOU'RE IN A COARSE AREA. THIS IS DEFINITELY A FINE AREA. Narrator: NO NUGGETS, BUT GLEN STILL HAS THE FINE-GOLD SLUICE. Glen: OH, YEAH. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SHOWING. JUST PUDDLES OF FINE GOLD RIGHT HERE. YEAH, THE CLEAN-UP'S LOOKING REALLY GOOD DOWN HERE, ZEKE. YEAH! THIS GOLD IS AWESOME! Zeke: [ LAUGHS ] SOLID GOLD, BABY. ALL RIGHT, FANTASTIC. OKAY, THE BUCKET'S READY. ALL READY FOR ANOTHER PILE OF GOLD. Narrator: IT'S TIME TO SEE JUST HOW BIG THE MOVE TO CLAIM 12 WILL PAY OFF. Zeke: YOU'RE GONNA MAKE BIG MONEY REAL FAST -- IT'S 'CAUSE YOU MOVED AROUND A WHOLE BUNCH AND FOUND A HOT SPOT. IF WE BOTH GET TO WORK, I THINK THAT WE CAN GET A LOT OF GOLD AND I THINK WE CAN GET THE JUMP ON EVERYONE ELSE. HOW'S IT LOOKING? Glen: THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME COLOR IN HERE.
