 IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. Narrator: AS THE WINTER MINING SEASON NEARS THE HOMESTRETCH... Emily: THE SNOW'S MELTING. THE ICE IS MELTING. IT'S TIME TO DO SOME MINING. Narrator: ...TEMPERATURES ARE ON THE RISE. ANYBODY COMES NEAR THIS SPOT ANYWHERE OVER HERE -- [BLEEP] IT -- THE WAR'S GONNA BE ON THIS TIME. Narrator: ACROSS THE FLEET, COMPETITION IS BUILDING. Shawn: I COME AND FOUND THE SPOT. NOW HE'S JUST OUT HERE LEECHING OFF ALL MY HARD WORK. I'M THINKING I WANT TO MOVE IN OVER HERE AND CUT HIM OFF. Narrator: AND NOW... IT'S DOG-EAT-DOG. [ DOGS HOWLING ] 7 MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... AT THE REAPER. Kris: LET'S GET GOING HERE. DIVER DOWN IN 10 MINUTES -- 5 MINUTES. I NEED THE HOOD. Narrator: WITH JUST OVER 13 OUNCES, WORTH 17 GRAND, COLLECTED THIS WINTER... Brad: WE CALL THIS SPOT "THE BONEYARD" JUST 'CAUSE IT'S FULL OF ICEBERGS. EVERYBODY'S WORKED ALL AROUND IT, BUT NOT THIS SPOT. Narrator: ...THE FIGHTIN' KELLYS ARE GUNNING FOR A BIG PAYDAY. JASON WAS QUITTING. VERN TOLD ME TO GET OVER HERE. SO WE TOOK THE ADVANTAGE. WE CAME OVER HERE. WE'RE THE LITTLE GUY. WE NEED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WE CAN GET. Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO... Man: AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. YOU WANT TO GO FROM HERE SOUTHWEST. Narrator: ...THE KELLYS WERE TIPPED OFF TO A POTENTIAL HOT SPOT... STOP! STOP! ...AND NEARLY DESTROYED THEIR RIG TRYING TO GET THERE. WHAT THE [BLEEP] JUST HAPPENED?! NOW, WITH TIME RUNNING OUT AND THEIR DREDGE IN TATTERS... NO, NO. [BLEEP] "SOMETHING," YOU KNOW? WE WERE GETTING AN OUNCE A DAY. WE NEED 3 OUNCE A DAY NOW. ...THIS HOLE WILL HAVE TO SAVE THEIR SEASON. THANK GOD HE'S DOWN THERE. HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS. HEY, WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE DOWN THERE? [ MAN LAUGHS ] EVERYONE'S A [BLEEP] COMEDIAN. WELL, HIT IT HARD, ANDY. WE NEED 70 OUNCES TO MAKE THIS WORTHWHILE THIS WINTER. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO DO THIS FOR FREE. YEAH? WELL, I WISH YOU'D PUT SOME GOLD IN THE BOX, AND THEN WE'D DO GOOD. DID YOU SAY "IDLE UP"? YEP. OKAY. WE IDLED IT UP. MAKE ME PROUD. Kris: I'M KIND OF REAL EXCITED TODAY. I HOPE WE GET 5 OUNCES. THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO ALASKA FOR. I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] LIVE HERE. I WANT TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND GO THE [BLEEP] HOME. Narrator: 8 MILES UP THE COAST, JUST OFF EAST BEACH... TODAY, I WANT TO GET THIS SLUICE-BOX SLED COMPLETED. PROGRESS EVERY DAY. Narrator: ...DIVER ZEKE TENHOFF IS STARTING OVER. Zeke: WORKING WITH GLEN WAS JUST LIKE, "MAN, IS THIS WHAT MINING'S ALL ABOUT FOR ME? "BECAUSE IF THIS IS WHAT MINING'S ALL ABOUT "AND IT'S NOT ANY FUN, THEN I JUST DON'T EVEN REALLY LIKE IT THAT MUCH ANYMORE." Narrator: THIS WINTER... Man: GOT 14.95 OUNCES. ...DESPITE A STRONG BEGINNING... SAFETY IS OVERRATED, RIGHT? HEY [BLEEP] YOUR [BLEEP] SMIRK, YOU [BLEEP] PUNK. Narrator: ...ZEKE'S PARTNERSHIP WITH GLEN LeBARON CRASHED AND BURNED IN A BATTLE OF EGOS. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU. I DON'T EVEN REALLY CARE IF WE'RE DOING THAT, DUDE. YOU WON'T EVEN SHAKE MY HAND, I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY REASON TO SPEAK TO YOU ANYMORE. NOW ZEKE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, SARAH DUNN, ARE SETTING OUT ON THEIR OWN. YOU KNOW, JUST, LIKE, HAVING "THE CLARK" PAINTED ON SOMETHING -- IT FEELS GOOD. YET AGAIN, I'M MORE OR LESS STARTING FROM SCRATCH, PUTTING TOGETHER ANOTHER ICE-MINING OPERATION. I'M GETTING BACK TO, LIKE, WHAT'S -- YOU KNOW, WHAT'S FUN AND EXCITING ABOUT THIS. Narrator: LATE IN THE SEASON AND WITHOUT A DREDGE, GETTING ANY MORE GOLD WILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE. THERE'S NO QUESTION AT ALL THAT BREAKING UP WITH GLEN IS THE RIGHT DECISION. IT'S A LOSS 'CAUSE I INVESTED A LOT IN TRYING TO MAKE THAT PARTNERSHIP WORK. YOU KNOW, I WANT ALL THAT FOOD BACK THAT I MADE FOR HIM. [ LAUGHS ] BUT I HAVE, LIKE, A LOT OF MORAL SUPPORT. I'VE GOT A GREAT GIRLFRIEND. YOU KNOW, I'M IN A REALLY GOOD PLACE. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING I'M GONNA LET GET ME DOWN. YEAH, I'M REALLY NOT VERY FAR AWAY FROM WHERE GLEN IS WORKING. HE'S JUST RIGHT OUT THERE. I DON'T HEAR THE ENGINE RUNNING. I DON'T THINK HE'S DREDGING. Narrator: JUST 800 YARDS OUT TO SEA... YOU KNOW, ZEKE AND I -- WE HAD A FALLING-OUT. THE LAST THING OF ZEKE'S THAT'S OVER HERE AT THE MISS NOMER OPERATION IS THIS FOOT VALVE. SO, I'M GONNA GO RETURN ZEKE HIS FOOT VALVE, AND THEN WE'RE OFFICIALLY SEPARATE. Narrator: ...GLEN LeBARON IS RIDDING HIMSELF OF THE REMAINING SCRAPS OF THEIR PARTNERSHIP. Glen: ZEKE IS IMMATURE. HE'S FOUR YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME, BUT IN MINING, HE IS FAR MORE THAN THAT, AND AS A PERSON, HE IS JUST A SELFISH [BLEEP] CHILD. GLEN IS JUST SO OBVIOUS. [ LAUGHS ] "I AM GOLD-DREDGING JESUS, "AND YOU HAVE TO WORSHIP ME IF YOU'RE GONNA EVEN BE IN MY PRESENCE." [ LAUGHS ] POOR JASMIN, MAN. ALL RIGHT, JASMIN, WE'RE GONNA BE USING THIS LINE QUITE A BIT MORE, SO WHILE I'M GONE, MAYBE YOU CAN UNTANGLE THIS. I'LL BE BACK IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES. [ DOG BARKS ] BARK AT HIM, CHARLIE. [ BARKING CONTINUES ] I JUST CAME OVER TO RETURN THIS FOOT VALVE. YEAH, WHEREVER. [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ TOOL WHIRRING ] OH, JUST THROWING STUFF TOGETHER, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES. YEAH, FOR THE MOST PART, I'M READY TO GET BACK TO WORK. COOL. I'M GONNA STAY OUT THERE IN THAT DEEP STUFF AS LONG AS I CAN. ALL RIGHT. UH-HUH. COOL. [ TOOL WHIRRING ] OKAY, MAN. Zeke: GLEN. [ LAUGHS ] THERE'S JUST NOTHING LEFT TO SAY. Narrator: 8 MILES DOWN THE COAST... ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Vernon: YEAH, THE SEASON -- WE'RE FINALLY ON THE GOLD. SO I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. WE JUST GOT TO GET ROLLING TODAY AND HAMMER IT. Narrator: HEADING TO WORK, THIS WINTER'S BREAKAWAY GOLD-COUNT LEADER, WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON. Vernon: RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE 116 OUNCES FOR THE SEASON. FIRST HOLE, WE DROPPED DOWN RIGHT ON TOP OF THE GOLD. MOVED ON TO THE NEXT HOLE, DROPPED DOWN ON MORE GOLD. AND THAT'S BEEN THE STORY. I REALLY THINK WE GOT A CHANCE OF PUTTING ANOTHER DAMN 150 OUNCES IN THAT BOX. THAT WOULD REALLY RING MY BELL. Narrator: SO FAR, VERNON AND HIS CREW HAVE BROUGHT IN A MASSIVE $151,000 IN GOLD. DAMN. THAT'S THE FRIGGIN' SHAMROCK. Narrator: BUT WITH SUCCESS... TEE-HEE-HEE. FIRST ONE HERE WINS. Narrator: ...COMES COMPETITION. LET HER MOVE. HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE SPOT. I MEAN, I DOUBT THEY'RE GONNA END UP WITH ENOUGH GOLD TO FILL THEIR ROTTEN TEETH WITH. 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO COME OVER HERE AND MOVE RIGHT IN ON TOP OF US LIKE THAT. I MEAN, WHAT'S THE FRIGGIN' POINT? YOU KNOW, THERE'S [BLEEP] DAMN WIDE-OPEN SPACES OUT THERE. Narrator: SETTING UP STAKES JUST A FEW FEET FROM THE WILD RANGER IS MR. GOLD HIMSELF, SHAWN POMRENKE, AND THE SHAMROCK. GPS IS SAYING RIGHT THERE IS A GOOD SPOT, SO OUR DIVE HOLE'S GONNA BE RIGHT THERE. SO WE CAN JUST REACH OVER AND GET IT. Vernon: THEY'RE GONNA COME OVER THERE AND TRY TO CLEAN OUT UNDER MY BUTT. HE'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE FOLLOWING HIM. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. NOW THEY'RE FOLLOWING US. Shawn: WELL, WE GOT A 30-OUNCE CLEAN-UP, BUT WE WANT A BIG PROFIT LINE. THAT WAY, WE GOT BIG WAGES FOR EVERYBODY. Narrator: SO FAR THIS WINTER... MR. GOLD CAN'T FIND NO GOLD! Narrator: ...SHAWN HAS BOUNCED FROM HOLE... WE'RE GONNA DO LITTLE, SHORT MOVES AND STAY ON THE GOLD. Narrator: ...TO HOLE, LOOKING FOR THE MOTHER LODE... Man: SO, A LITTLE BIT OF STUFF FOR NOTHING. IT AIN'T EVEN WORTH TALKING ABOUT. WELL, WE PUT A COUPLE OUNCES IN THE BOX, ANYWAYS, SO... Narrator: ...BUT HAS COLLECTED ONLY 30 OUNCES, WORTH JUST 42 GRAND -- FAR SHORT OF HIS 150-OUNCE GOAL. Shawn: SO, HOPEFULLY WE'RE ON THE GOLD ON THIS SPOT. I MEAN, WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. VERN'S DIVERS AND OUR DIVERS MIGHT BE GOING AT IT TO GET THE GOLD FIRST. WE'LL SEE. Narrator: NOW THE GLOVES ARE COMING OFF. YEAH, I GUESS IT'S TURNING INTO A TURF WAR. I'LL GO OVER THERE AND TALK TO SHAWN, PRETTY MUCH TO JUST LET HIM KNOW I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THAT'S BAD FORM. HOWDY. YEAH, SO, PROBABLY GONNA BE NOZZLE-TO-NOZZLE. HOW LONG OF A HOSE Y'ALL GOT? ABOUT 70, 60 FEET -- 70 FEET. YEP. SO I GUESS WE'LL BE SEEING YOU DOWN THERE. WELL, I GUESS THE RACE IS ON. OKAY. Narrator: AFTER GIVING SHAWN A REAL PIECE OF HIS MIND, VERNON HEADS BACK TO RALLY HIS TROOPS. Vernon: YOU KNOW, I GUESS IT'S JUST EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. Shawn: I DON'T REALLY GIVE A [BLEEP] WHAT VERNON THINKS. NO, WE'RE JUST GONNA MOVE WHERE WE WANT TO MOVE AND START SUCKING UP SOME GOLD. Vernon: I RESENT THE FACT THAT THEY HAD TO COME CROWD IN ON US LIKE THAT. BUT AS IT IS NOW, WE GOT TO GET OVER THERE AND GET THAT PIECE OF GROUND BETWEEN THE TWO DREDGES BEFORE THEY DO. SO IT'S PUT SOME HEAT IN THE GAME. Narrator: THE BATTLE LINES ARE DRAWN. NOW IT'S AN ALL-OUT RACE FOR THE GOLD. Man: ABOUT TO PULL THESE BLOCKS AND MOVE THE DREDGE OVER AND START DIVING. LOOK HOW FAT CODY IS. I TOLD YOU HE'S GETTING FAT. LOOK AT HIM. YOU THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT? LOOK AT THAT [BLEEP] CRACK HANGING OUT. CODY, GET YOU A PAIR OF DRAWERS, BOY! AND THE GOLD WAR HAS BEGUN. [ TOOL WHIRRING ] HEY [BLEEP] YOU. YEAH, THEY WERE TALKING [BLEEP] OVER THERE, VERN'S GUYS, SO I JUST WENT AND SET AN ICE BLOCK RIGHT WHERE THEY WERE PLANNING ON MINING, SLOWING THEIR [BLEEP] PROGRESS DOWN A LITTLE BIT. WHAT HE DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT I'M PUTTING THAT ICE BLOCK BACK WHERE IT [BLEEP] CAME FROM. [ LAUGHS ] THE KILLER WHALE PUT AN ICE BLOCK RIGHT ON OUR [BLEEP] [ LAUGHS ] [ TIRES SKIDDING ] [ Laughing ] SMASH! THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA MOVE A 5,000-POUND ICE BLOCK WITH A VAN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [ LAUGHS ] I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO MOVE IT. Vernon: LET THE GOLD WARS BEGIN. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... AT THE EROICA... HOW ARE THINGS GOING DOWN THERE, BUDDY? I THINK THIS IS THE BEST DIVE I'VE EVER BEEN ON, AND THAT'S INCLUDING LAST SUMMER. ...DREDGE OWNER EMILY RIEDEL IS MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME. Emily: I GOT TWO GREENHORN CREW MEMBERS, AND I'M A GREENHORN CAPTAIN. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EVER MANAGING AN ICE-MINING OPERATION. WE HAD A LOT OF BAD [BLEEP] HAPPEN TO US THIS ICE-MINING SEASON, AND WE'RE STILL [BLEEP] KICKING. THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. Narrator: FOR FIVE WEEKS... ...BREAKDOWN... WITHOUT HAVING THE SUCTION... ...AFTER BREAKDOWN. NOW! PULL ME UP! PULL ME UP! THE [BLEEP] REGULATOR FROZE. Narrator: ...HAS KEPT EMILY FROM PRODUCING ANY GOLD. I'M HEMORRHAGING MONEY IN THIS OPERATION. NOW... Man: HOW'S THE DRAGON SLAYER SEEM TO BE WORKING? SHE SEEMS TO BE WORKING LIKE A DOLL, BROTHER. WITH 50 GRAND INVESTED, HER DREDGE IS FINALLY FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS. COME ON, BABY. OH, DUDE. WE NEED TO CLEAN THIS THING OUT, LIKE, NOW. WHAT'S THAT? THE NUGGET TRAP? Narrator: NORMALLY, THE SIGHT OF GOLD IS A MINER'S DREAM COME TRUE. Emily: THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY GOLD THERE. YEAH, NO KIDDING. IN THIS CASE, IT'S A POTENTIAL NIGHTMARE. THE END OF OUR DRAGON SLAYER -- THE SLUICE, THE NUGGET TRAP IS SUPPOSED TO JUST TRAP LARGER PIECES OF GOLD THAT MAKE IT OVER THE GRIZZLY, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TRAPPING FINER PIECES THAT AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. SO IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN BLOWING PAST COMPLETELY. Narrator: THE DRAGON SLAYER WORKS BY FILTERING THE LIGHTER, FINE GOLD AND PUMPING IT TO A TOPSIDE SLUICE BOX. SEEING FINE GOLD IN THE BACK OF THE SUBMERSIBLE MEANS THEY COULD BE BLOWING HALF THEIR TAKE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. Man: YOU THINK WE'RE LOSING THAT MUCH? DUDE, DUDE, THERE'S A FLAKE RIGHT HERE ON THE END OF THE NUGGET TRAP. LOOK AT THAT -- RIGHT ON THE EDGE, A PIECE OF GOLD. Emily: HEY, WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU DOWN A JUG TO PUT THE NUGGET TRAY INTO. TEN-FOUR. WE'RE GONNA SEND THIS JUG DOWN TO TONY. HE'S GONNA TAKE THE PIECE OF CARPET OFF AND SHAKE IT INTO THE JUG. Narrator: WITH HER SEASON ON THE LINE, EMILY ORDERS AN EMERGENCY CLEAN-UP. I'M SENDING THE WHOLE DAMN THING UP. Emily: WE CAN'T JUST KEEP WORKING TO KEEP WORKING, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO KEEP ON MINING ALL THIS AMAZING GOLD THAT WE'RE SEEING DOWN THERE AND NOT CATCH IT. YEAH, THERE'S COLOR IN THERE. THAT SHOULDN'T BE GETTING THERE. AND THIS SHOULDN'T BE GETTING THERE. DAMN IT. SOMETHING SCREWED UP. ICE MINING IS ALL ABOUT GETTING WHAT YOU CAN WHILE THE GETTING IS GOOD. ALL I CAN THINK OF IS, "WE'RE LOSING MOST OF THE GOLD THAT WE'RE MINING." WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR CONCENTRATES BACK TO THE GARAGE AND SEE HOW MUCH GOLD WE'RE CATCHING. WE KNOW WE'RE ON GOOD GOLD, BUT IT'S A MATTER OF HOW WELL WE'RE CATCHING IT NOW, HOW WELL THE SYSTEM WORKS. Narrator: LESS THAN A MILE AWAY... AT THE MISS NOMER. Glen: SO, I'M JUST GONNA WORK REAL HARD, GET AS MANY DIVE HOURS IN AS POSSIBLE AND TRY TO GET ALONG WITH MY "JAZZY BEAR." I'M GONNA GO INSIDE. I'M COLD. OKAY. I GUESS YOU CAN GO INSIDE. Narrator: FREE FROM HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH ZEKE, GLEN LeBARON AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, JASMIN GEORGE, ARE GETTING BACK TO WORK. Glen: IT'S TIME TO SUIT UP. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF DAYLIGHT. WELL, I'M REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE MY NEW GOAL IS TO GET MORE GOLD THAN ALL THE ICE TEAMS COMBINED BY MYSELF, NOT EVEN COUNTING WHAT ZEKE AND I GOT. I BELIEVE IN YOU. I MEAN, I BELIEVE IN YOU ALL THE TIME. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU SAY JOKES LIKE THAT. OKAY. WHY DON'T WE JUST NOT MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THAT, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE LAME. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY I MADE A JOKE YOU DIDN'T LIKE. Glen: I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS A TEMPER. JASMIN HAS QUITE A TEMPER HERSELF. SHE JUST EXPRESSES IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SHE JUST SHUTS DOWN ALL COMMUNICATION AND JUST GOES SILENT AND SOMETIMES SHE CRIES, WHICH JUST MAKES ME EVEN MORE IRRITATED. YEAH, I'M CONFIDENT IN GLEN'S MINING ABILITIES, AND I KNOW THAT HE'S GONNA FIND A LOT OF GOLD TODAY. GOOD LUCK! GET US SOME GOLD! HEY, I'M HERE. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE BACK IN THE WATER? IT FEELS REALLY GOOD. YEAH, IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON WHEN YOU GO UNDERWATER. THERE'S USUALLY KIND OF A SENSE OF SERENITY AND CALMNESS THAT OVERCOMES YOU IMMEDIATELY, AND ALL YOUR WORRIES KIND OF GO AWAY. LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING. OKAY, I WILL. YEAH, I'M JUST PUNCHING MY FIRST HOLE. THE LAST TIME I WAS DOWN HERE, BEFORE THE FIGHT THAT ZEKE AND I HAD, I DID AN OUNCE AND A QUARTER IN FOUR HOURS. I FOUND A TRANSITION WHERE THE SAND MEETS THE HARDPAN, AND THE GOLD IS LOOKING REALLY GOOD. GOLD TOUCHING GOLD. I EXPECT THAT WE'LL DO AT LEAST AN OUNCE TODAY. GOOD LUCK. I'LL BE UP HERE IF YOU NEED ANYTHING. HEY, JAS, THIS REGULATOR'S FEELING A LITTLE BIT TIGHT. WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SAID THE REGULATOR FEELS A LITTLE BIT TIGHT. COULD YOU GO OUTSIDE AND GIVE ME A PRESSURE CHECK? YEAH. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ MACHINERY HUMMING ] WHAT THE [BLEEP] THE ORANGE AND BLUE AIR BALL VALVE WAS CLOSED, AND I OPENED IT. HEY, JAS, MY AIR! MY AIR, JAS! Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... AT THE MISS NOMER... WHAT THE [BLEEP] THE ORANGE AND BLUE AIR BALL VALVE WAS CLOSED, AND I OPENED IT. [BLEEP] HEY, JAS, MY AIR! MY AIR, JAS! Narrator: INSTEAD OF INCREASING GLEN'S AIR PRESSURE, JASMIN TRANSFERRED HIS OXYGEN TO THE DRAGON'S STABILIZING FLOAT BAG. THE DRAGON'S FLOATING TO THE SURFACE. [BLEEP] JAS. [ MACHINERY HUMMING ] Jasmine: HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? YOU ALMOST CAUSED A MAJOR CATASTROPHE, JAS. AND IT NEARLY -- IT WAS TAKING MY AIR, AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT. I'M SORRY. I TOLD YOU I NEEDED AIR! I'M AT 30 FEET, AND SUDDENLY, THE DREDGE FLOATS TO THE SURFACE AND I'M TANGLED UP IN IT OR... THAT'S CHAOS! THAT'S TOTAL [BLEEP] CHAOS. ARE YOU COMING TO THE TOP? [ Voice breaking ] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I JUST WANT TO TURN THIS MIKE OFF AND NOT TALK TO HIM RIGHT NOW. Jasmine: I DIDN'T KILL HIM. EVERYTHING'S FINE. I'M JUST GLAD HE'S NOT COMING UP RIGHT NOW. THAT WAS JUST A REALLY CLOSE CALL. DON'T YOU EVER OPEN UP A BALL VALVE WITHOUT ASKING ME ABOUT IT FIRST. DUH! [BLEEP]HEAD. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU JUST DID. [ SNIFFLES ] Narrator: 8 MILES TO THE WEST... ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... WE GOT TO MAKE HAY WHILE THE SUN SHINES. THE POMRENKES ARE LIKE 120 FEET FROM US. OUR HOSE WILL DAMN NEAR REACH THEIR FRONT PORCH, AND I KNOW THEIRS IS JUST AS LONG. SO, IF WE GET IN EARLY, LIKE RIGHT NOW, AS SOON AS WE GET DOWN, WE'RE GONNA START WORKING THIS AREA OVER HERE AND GET THE GOLD BEFORE THE POMRENKES CAN GET TO IT. Narrator: ...RACING TO BEAT THE SHAMROCK TO THE GOLD, VERNON IS SENDING DOWN LEAD DIVER JUSTIN COOK. JUSTIN, MAN -- YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS HIM OFF. WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN THERE AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE HIM A RUN FOR HIS MONEY. THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE. I WANT TO SUCK IT UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. IT'S KIND OF A RACE FOR THE ROSES RIGHT NOW, RACE FOR THE GOLD. HEY, JUSTIN, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING UNDER THERE? LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A LITTLE CLAY BOTTOM HERE. LOOKS TO BE REAL PROMISING. NO POMRENKES DOWN THERE, HUH? ALL RIGHT. WELL, SUCK IT ALL UP BEFORE THEY GET THERE. Woman: YEAH, TAKE IT ALL. Narrator: OVER ON THE SHAMROCK... LET'S GET THIS THING FIRED UP, AND I'LL GO DOWN AND DO A DIVE. I THINK I SEEN JUSTIN GOING DOWN OVER THERE. I'M GONNA SCARE THE CRAP OUT OF HIM. GET HER GOING. Narrator: ...MR. GOLD HAS A FEW TRICKS UP HIS SLEEVE. GONNA BE A FUN DAY. PUTTING THESE ICE CLEATS ON HERE ON SHAWN'S BOOTS SO HIS CLEATS MIGHT GIVE HIM SOME TRACTION UPSIDE DOWN ON THE ICE. YEAH! LET'S GET 'EM! Cody: SHAWN JUST PUT AIR IN THE BUCKET OF HIS REGULATOR AND MAKE HIMSELF FLOAT SO HE DON'T GIVE HIMSELF AWAY ON THE BOTTOM. Narrator: OUTFITTED WITH A 5-GALLON BUCKET AND A PAIR OF ICE CLEATS... ...SHAWN POMRENKE IS "ICE NINJA." [ LAUGHS ] Woman: YOU SEEING ANY GOLD DOWN THERE? OH, YEAH. SEEING SOME GOOD COLOR RIGHT NOW. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] PRETTY EASY. THAT'S WHAT'S UP. IF WE CAN JUST STAY IN THE COLOR LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE, WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. THAT'S THE TRUTH. SEE OUR NEIGHBOR DOWN THERE, SHAWN? Shawn: WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE? OH. THERE HE IS. Justin: OH, YEAH. GIVE IT TO ME! IT'S GOT TO BE CLOSE TO OUNCE, OUNCE AND A HALF AN HOUR. JUST GET ON IT AND SUCK IT UP, AND LEAVE THEM THE TAILINGS. OVER. OH, YEAH. WE HIT THE SPOT RIGHT HERE. SOME NICE CHUNKY TO IT. HELL YEAH. SEND IT ON UP. OH, YEAH. AAH! GUYS! [ LAUGHS ] I WANT TO GET THAT NUGGET FIRST. THAT'S MY GOLD, YOU SON OF A BITCH. WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE, JUSTIN? OH, I GOT SHAWN DOWN HERE. HE THINKS HE'S GONNA STEAL MY GOLD, YOU SON OF A BITCH. KEEP HIM OFF OUR CHEESE. I JUST THREW A HUGE CLOGGER RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS NOZZLE. SUCK HIS ASS UP, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S PRETTY CRAZY THEY'RE BATTLING DOWN THERE. I WISH I COULD SEE IT, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] SON OF A BITCH. BOX LOOKS LOW. YOU BETTER GET THAT PLUGGED. OH, HE DISAPPEARED. WHERE'D HE GO? YOU GOT A DAMN JAM. UGH. I'M GONNA LOCATE THE CLOG AND SEE HOW BAD IT IS. WHERE'D HE GO? [ LAUGHS ] OH, THEY GOT 'EM. [ LAUGHS ] Man: I JUST PUT ANOTHER PLUGGER UP HIS NOZZLE. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: FOR SHAWN, THE FIRST RULE OF A GOLD WAR... YEAH, I THINK WE GOT A JAM. [BLEEP] POMRENKES. ...THERE ARE NO RULES. YEAH! WE GOT 'EM! Narrator: 7 MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Kris: ARE YOU SEEING ANY GOLD? NO. I DON'T SEE MUCH. ...AFTER 48 HOURS SPENT PROSPECTING THEIR NEW GROUNDS... OKAY, FINE. Narrator: ...HOPES OF HITTING A GAME-CHANGING PAY STREAK ARE HANGING BY A THREAD. Kris: I HOPE ANDY FINDS GOLD TODAY, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MOVE TODAY. WE CAN'T EVEN MOVE TODAY. WE DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE TO MOVE EVERYTHING AROUND. I DON'T KNOW, MAN. WE JUST CAN'T [BLEEP] WIN, IT LOOKS LIKE. OKAY, I'M SWITCHING SPOTS, MAN. I'M GONNA WALK OVER HERE. OKAY. TEN-FOUR. WHERE'D YOU GO, BY THE WAY? UH... 10 FEET FROM THE LEFT OF THE SPOT WHERE I LEFT OFF. OKAY, GOOD. [ SIGHS ] I LOVE BIG ROCKS. IT KIND OF SUCKS. WE THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA COME TODAY AND GET 3 TO 5 OUNCES APIECE, THIS HOT SPOT -- I'M STARING AT THIS REALLY NICE-SIZED ROCK. SO, I LIKE BIG ROCKS. AND, REALLY...REALLY, WE JUST GOT TO WORK HARD TO MAKE OUR 1 OUNCE RIGHT NOW. THIS SUCKS. WELL, I'M GONNA PUMP THE HOLE REAL FAST AND SEE WHAT THERE IS HERE AND SEE HOW DEEP IT IS. BIG-ASS ROCK. HEY, IS IT STILL RUNNING MATERIAL? THE BOX ISN'T RUNNING VERY GOOD RIGHT NOW. TELL YOU WHAT -- IDLE DOWN. TURN THE IDLE DOWN FOR TWO MINUTES. OKAY. AND THEN IDLE BACK UP. Narrator: TO CLEAR THE JAMMED SUCTION HOSE... HURRY UP. ...KRIS MUST POWER DOWN THE ENGINE, ALLOWING HIS BROTHER TO WORK THE ROCK FREE. THERE YOU GO. OH, YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT. [ LAUGHS ] HOLY [BLEEP] LOOK AT THAT LITTLE PUDDLE OF GOLD RIGHT THERE. CAN YOU SEE THAT? ALL THESE PIECES? THAT'S A GREAT CONCENTRATION. OH, THERE'S GOLD ALL THE WAY -- IF WE'RE GETTING GOLD AT THIS BACK STAGE OF THE BOX, WE'RE GETTING [BLEEP] GOLD. Narrator: WHAT ANDY HAS BEEN REPORTING AS BARELY WORKABLE... HEY, ANDY -- STUPID! ...MAY TURN OUT TO BE THEIR HOTTEST SPOT YET. [ MOTOR REVS ] THAT'S PERFECT. [BLEEP] STUPID! I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOOKING IN THE BOX LIKE AN IDIOT. Kris: HEY! I LOOKED IN THE BOX. THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD IN IT. THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD IN THE BOX! [BLEEP] YEAH, KEEP PUNCHING HOLES. YOU'LL FIND GOLD. OKAY. I'LL JUST TAKE MY BROTHER'S SHIRT. I'LL WRAP IT AROUND MY FOOT. HE WON'T EVEN KNOW. THIS IS TURNING FROM THE BONEYARD TO THE CASH REGISTER. Narrator: JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY... ...AT THE WILD RANGER... Justin: WE GOT A JAM. YEAH, HE WAS DOWN THERE HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH SHAWN, AND THEIR RIG IS 120 FEET FROM HERE OR 100 FEET FROM HERE. AND SO THEY WERE, LIKE, NOSE-TO-NOSE TRYING TO SCOOP UP THAT SLIVER OF GOLD. Narrator: AFTER SHAWN POMRENKE SABOTAGED HIS SUCTION HOSE, VERNON ADKISON IS LOSING PRECIOUS TIME. [BLEEP] DAMN IT. Narrator: NOW, WHILE THE CAT'S AWAY... NOW SHAWN'S DOWN THERE SUCKING IT UP, WHICH DOESN'T MAKE US HAPPY. Narrator: ...MR. GOLD WILL PLAY. I'M TAKING ALL THE GOLD OUT OF HIS CUT RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHS ] HE TOOK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN RIGHT BEFORE THE REALLY, REALLY GOOD GOLD. OH! HOLY CRAP! THERE'S SOME BIG NUGGETS, BOYS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUT THESE ONES IN MY GLOVE. THEY'RE HUGE. THAT'S LIKE A PIGGY BANK THERE. Narrator: IN DOWNTOWN NOME... Steve: ANY WORK I CAN DO TO GET THE MINNOW BACK. I'M DOING DISHES TO GET HER BACK. Narrator: ...FORMER DREDGE OWNER STEVE RIEDEL IS STILL TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK. I'LL SELL MY BODY TO THE WOMEN OF NOME TO GET THE MINNOW BACK. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE ANY TAKERS FOR THAT ONE. WELL, SANG, I'M DONE HERE. THANK YOU FOR HELP. SURE. YOU'RE WELCOME. BOY, MEAN STREETS GETTING THE MINNOW BACK, MAN. PAY DOING DISHES IS ONE BUCK AT A TIME. Narrator: IN THE CITY OF NOME... Emily: ALL I CAN SAY IS -- IT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE DOING THIS NOW BECAUSE IF WE'D HAVE KEPT ON MINING AND WE WEREN'T AWARE OF HOW MUCH GOLD WE WERE LOSING, WE WOULD BE REALLY [BLEEP] NOW WE'RE JUST KIND OF SORT OF [BLEEP] Narrator: FOR EMILY RIEDEL... THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CATCHING THE MAJORITY OF THE GOLD. NOT LOOKING GOOD. ...THIS CLEAN-UP WILL DETERMINE WHETHER HER $50,000 INVESTMENT IS ACTUALLY RECOVERING GOLD. WE GOT 13 HOURS ON THE BOX. WE'RE HOPING FOR 5 OUNCES AT LEAST. YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING EXPERIMENTAL AND USE AN EXPERIMENTAL DREDGE. I CHOSE THE WRONG TIME TO TEST OUT THE INVENTION, DURING ICE MINING. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE DAMAGE? HOW BAD ARE WE? THERE'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN AN OUNCE. I'M GUESSING AROUND AN OUNCE. THAT'S PRETTY [BLEEP] SAD. IT'S PROBABLY THE WORST CLEAN-OUT I'VE EVER SEEN. ONE OUNCE OF GOLD IS WORTH JUST OVER 1,300 BUCKS. Emily: THAT DOESN'T EVEN COVER HALF THE GAS FOR THE SEASON. ALL RIGHT, WELL, LOOK, GUYS, I KNOW THIS CLEAN-OUT IS DISCOURAGING, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE DISCOURAGED. WE DID THIS CLEAN-OUT BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG, AND WE FIGURED OUT WHAT IT IS. WE NEED THAT THING DIALED IN, WORKING 100%, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE ON SUCH A LIMITED TIME FRAME. Narrator: THIS LATE INTO APRIL, EMILY'S ONLY CHOICE... WE'LL INCREASE THE SUM TO THE SURFACE, WE'LL SLOW DOWN THE ROCKS TUMBLING OVER THE DRAGON SLAYER, AND THEN THAT'LL INCREASE OUR GOLD RECOVERY. Narrator: ...MAKE THE BEST WITH WHAT SHE'S GOT. SO, IF WE GOT TO TAKE A DAY TO DO IT, FINE. IT'S BETTER THAN RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES. YEAH. AND THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO. AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA TIGHTEN UP EVERYTHING. Narrator: WHILE EMILY'S SEASON IS ON THE ROPES... OUT ON THE ICE... Jasmin: I JUST STILL FEEL LIKE [BLEEP] ...WITHOUT GETTING THAT ANGRY. Narrator: ...GLEN LeBARON'S RELATIONSHIP WITH JASMIN -- NOT FARING MUCH BETTER. I TOLD JASMIN I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE BREATHING, AND SHE JUST OPENED UP A BALL VALVE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT REALLY THINKING OF WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT ARE. JAS IS PROBABLY REALLY UPSET. BUT I ASKED HER TO CHECK OUT MY AIR PRESSURE, AND NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M LIKE SECONDS AWAY FROM A MAJOR FIASCO WITH, LIKE, THE DRAGON FLYING TO THE SURFACE UNEXPECTEDLY, YOU KNOW, AS I'M, LIKE, GASPING FOR AIR. IT'S THE LAST THING I NEEDED TO HAPPEN, AND SO IT REALLY PISSED ME OFF. HONEY, I'M SORRY I GOT UPSET EARLIER. YOU KNOW, ALL OF THAT WAS JUST -- YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS DOWN THERE, AND IF YOU'RE GONNA -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT, YOU NEED TO TELL ME AHEAD OF TIME.
