 THIS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A GREAT MINING AREA. A LOT OF OUNCES OF GOLD CAME OUT OF THIS NECK OF THE WOODS. NARRATOR: THE 116-YEAR-OLD GOLD RUSH IS STILL GOING STRONG. Steve: THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING A MINER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT IS. IT'S A TREASURE HUNT EVERY DAY -- THAT'S MINING. Narrator: IN A TOWN THAT ONCE PRODUCED A 182-OUNCE GOLD NUGGET, THE SEARCH FOR THE MOTHER LODE RAGES ON. TOSS IT AND RUN DOWN HERE. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT MINING IS THAT IT'S ENTIRELY BASED ON THE SELF -- YOU CAN EITHER MAKE GREAT THINGS HAPPEN FOR YOURSELF OR YOU CAN FAIL.

 IT'S A GAMBLE, BUT IT'S AN EXCITING GAMBLE. Hank: MY FORTUNE IS AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. I'VE INVESTED ALL MY MONEY IN THIS THING. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. Narrator: IN A SHORT SUMMER DREDGING SEASON, CALM SEAS AND CLEAR SKIES MEAN THE BERING SEA... IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS. IT'S LOOKING REALLY GOOD. HOPEFULLY WE CAN JUST KEEP IT GOING HERE. Narrator: AS MINERS HIT THE WATER, EVERY TRIP COULD BE THE BEST DAY OF THEIR LIVES. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF GOLD WAITING FOR US OUT THERE. SO ALL WE GOT TO DO IS JUST GO OUT THERE, WALK AROUND ON THE BOTTOM, AND SUCK IT UP. Narrator: ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOME... Steve: THE BUCKET PINS LOOK ALL BRAND-NEW. YOU KNOW, THE BUCKETS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE. THE [BLEEP] TIRES ARE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. Narrator: ...FATHER AND SON, STEVE AND SHAWN POMRENKE, KICK THE TIRES ON A PAIR OF 101-TON EARTHMOVERS. THE ENGINE'S GOT 12 CYLINDERS, ONE CYLINDER IS NOT PERFECT. Narrator: FOR 62-YEAR-OLD STEVE... I'M GOING INLAND MINING. THAT'S WHERE MY HEART IS. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE TO DO. ARE YOU IN ON THE INLAND MINING OR OUT? Narrator: ...STARTING A NEW INLAND-MINING VENTURE SITS ATOP HIS BUCKET LIST. Shawn: I'M PRETTY NERVOUS ABOUT THE INLAND MINING. BEING A GOLD MINER, YOU COULD END UP BEING HOMELESS. Narrator: BUT HIS SON SHAWN IS RELUCTANT TO PUT THEIR HARD-EARNED GOLD AT RISK. Steve: A LOT OF PEOPLE RETIRE WHEN THEY'RE 62, AND RETIRING MEANS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. WELL, THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO. I WANT MY ONE LAST HURRAH. Shawn: MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS, GO OUT AND YOU START SPENDING $25,000, $30,000 A WEEK IN FUEL, YOU CAN LOSE A HELL OF A LOT OF MONEY IN A HURRY. AND ALL THIS HARD WORK AND EVERYTHING WE'VE WORKED FOR COULD BE GONE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS. Steve: WOW. THAT'S LIKE A PACKAGE RESPONSIBILITY FROM HELL. WHEN YOUR WHEEL BEARING GOES OUT IN YOUR CAR, YOU PAY 300 BUCKS. WHEEL BEARING GOES ON THIS, IT'S 5,000, 10,000 BUCKS. THE TIRES ARE 20,000 BUCKS APIECE NOW. WE'RE LOOKING FOR OIL LEAKS ON THE MAIN BOOM CYLINDERS. OILS LEAK IN THERE, YOU'RE TALKING 20,000, 25,000 BUCKS FOR A REBUILD. THEY LOOK LIKE A GOOD DEAL, SO WE'RE GETTING THEM. Shawn: YOU GET ONE BIG PIECE, YOU GOT TO HAVE ANOTHER BIG PIECE, AND THEN YOU GOT TO BUY ANOTHER BIG PIECE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ANOTHER, TWO OTHER, THREE OTHER BIG PIECES -- BIG INVESTMENT. THIS MACHINE'S GOT THE MOTOR OUT OF IT, AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PRETTY PENNY JUST TO GET IT UP AND RUNNING. YEAH, BUT YOU GOT STEVE POMRENKE -- HE REBUILDS THINGS THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE WAY. ONCE YOU SEE HOW MUCH GOLD'S ON THAT GROUND THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DIGGING, YOU'LL BE [BLEEP] YOUR PANTS. IF I WORK A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET A BRAND-NEW DOZER FOR HIM, IF I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN, AND MAKE HIS LAST RUN THE BEST THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN, THEN I GOT HIS BACK. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] WE GOT TO BUY THEM. WE GOT TO BUY THEM. Narrator: TO SECURE THE EQUIPMENT FOR HIS OLD MAN, SHAWN AND THE CHRISTINE ROSE WILL HAVE TO PULL 5 POUNDS OF GOLD OUT OF THE BERING SEA. BACK IN TOWN... ...OVER AT BELMONT BEACH... HERE WE GO. ...FOUR WEEKS INTO THE SEASON, WHAT'S LEFT OF THE KELLY FAMILY IS FINALLY LAUNCHING THEIR DREDGE. Brad: IT'S SAD ANDY'S GONE. THIS IS A GOOD BUSINESS. HE SHOULD BE HERE WORKING. SIX DAYS AGO... I HOPE YOU AND MY BROTHER LIVE GREAT. YEAH, ANY TIME. ...ANGERED OVER HIS FATHER'S NEW FAMILY... I'M SO DONE. ...BRAD'S SON ANDY QUIT THE REAPER, LEAVING HIS DAD AND BROTHER HIGH AND DRY. ANDY REALLY PISSES ME OFF. HE'S A [BLEEP] LOSER. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO HOME TO HAWAII, TOO, BUT I WANT TO GO HOME WITH A POCKET FULL OF MONEY, NOT GO HOME BROKE. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE ABANDONED ME AND [BLEEP] I'M ALWAYS TAKING CARE OF HIM. YOU KNOW, NOW I'M STUCK WITH MY DAD THIS WHOLE TIME. WE'RE GOING OUT TO THE WEST REC AREA. WE JUST GOT TO GET ON THE GOLD. IF YOU NEED TO MOVE, WE'LL MOVE. Narrator: DOWN TO JUST TWO KELLYS, THE LITTLE DREDGE IS HEADED FULL SPEED TO THE WEST BEACH PUBLIC MINING AREA... WE CAN STAY IN THE REC AREA, AND I'M GUARANTEED TO MAKE A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY JUST [BLEEP] AROUND HERE. ARE YOU GOING AS FAST AS YOU CAN GO? Narrator: ...OF COURSE, ON THE REAPER, "FULL SPEED" IS A RELATIVE TERM. WE'RE JUST -- THE ASS-END OF THE BOAT IS DRAGGING TOO MUCH OF THE WATER. DAD DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON ANYTHING. IT HAS NO FLOATS ON THE HOSE, IT HAS NO LADDER. THERE'S NO DOOR -- OUR CABIN IS BASICALLY A WIND TUNNEL. THE THING LOOKS LIKE A LOWRIDER. THE BACK OF IT SITS RIGHT INTO THE WATER, AND WE'RE JUST THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE OCEAN SOMETIMES. Brad: I'M TRYING TO SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, LEAVE HERE WITH A BUNCH OF CASH IN MY POCKET. I ALWAYS SAY I'M BROKE. THAT'S THE RULE OF THUMB -- ALWAYS SAY YOU'RE BROKE, NEVER BE BROKE. ANCHOR AWAY! [ MOTOR REVVING ] KRIS IS GETTING READY TO DIVE. OUR GOAL FOR TODAY IS A COUPLE OUNCES. WE WANT TO GET AS MUCH GOLD AS POSSIBLE. HAVING THIS NEW BABY HAS CHANGED MY WHOLE OUTLOOK ON MONEY. YOU GOT A GOOD WOMAN, YOU GOT TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU HAVE THIS NEW FAMILY, IT MOTIVATES YOU. NOW I'M MOTIVATED LIKE I WAS 20 YEARS OLD AGAIN. YOU KNOW, I'M ON THE STRAIGHT HUSTLE TO GO TO THE TOP NOW. KRIS, YOU'RE OUR NUMBER-ONE GOLD GUY NOW, MAN, AND I'M REALLY DEPENDING ON YOU. Narrator: EXPECTING A CHILD IN THE FALL AT THE AGE OF 52, BRAD NEEDS HIS FIRST BORN TO HIT PAY DIRT. YEAH, EVERYTHING'S GOOD. Kris: OKAY, THE GROUND ALREADY LOOKS WEIRD. IT LOOKS LIKE I'M ON KIND OF A SANDBAR. AND THEN THERE'S LIKE PATCHES OF COBBLE EVERYWHERE. SWEET, MAYBE YOU CAN FOLLOW THE COBBLE INTO THE GOLD. YEAH, WELL, LET'S HOPE. DOES IT LOOK LIKE THE LOOFAH SPOT? YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THE LOOFAH SPOT. Narrator: IN THE HEAVILY WORKED PUBLIC REC AREA, KRIS MUST SEARCH FOR GROUND THAT APPEARS UNTOUCHED BY DECADES OF OTHER DREDGERS. SEE, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE LOOFAH ROCK AREA, IS BECAUSE WHEN I FIND THIS, I FIND THAT THE GROUND UNDERNEATH IT HASN'T BEEN WORKED YET. SO IT'S NOT GUARANTEEING THAT THERE'S GOLD THERE, IT'S JUST GUARANTEEING THAT THE GROUND HASN'T BEEN WORKED YET. IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A LOOFAH SPONGE, HUH? KIND OF. YEAH, LET'S PRAY FOR A LOT OF GOLD IN THE BOX, THEN. I HOPE SO. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING DOWN HERE. AND NOT BEEN WASTING MY TIME. WELL, I HOPE HE FINDS GOLD. THERE'S A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE BOTTOM NOW. I WANTED TO HEAR A "YEAH, I'M FINDING GOLD." ONE HOT SPOT IS ALL IT TAKES TO MAKE YOUR SEASON -- THAT'S IT. Narrator: AS KRIS' SEARCH BEGINS, 6 MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... FIRST BUCKET OF THE DAY. HERE WE GO. Narrator: OWNER HANK SCHIMSCHAT AND DECKHAND STAN MILLER ARE FIRING UP THE 80-FOOT, 96-TON GOLD GRABBER. HOPEFULLY THERE'S SOME GOLD HERE. WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP AT IT. GOT TO KEEP TRYING. Narrator: AFTER A 25-YEAR CAREER RUNNING A CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS, HANK CASHED OUT AND SUNK HIS RETIREMENT INTO THE MEGA-DREDGE. Hank: MY WHOLE FAMILY THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY FOR GOING GOLD MINING. YOU KNOW, GOT CLOSE TO A MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN THIS, BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH EVERYTHING I'VE DONE. Narrator: NOW, WELL INTO HIS SOPHOMORE SEASON, HANK'S RECOVERED JUST 12 OUNCES OF GOLD -- BARELY ENOUGH TO COVER THE OVERHEAD ON HIS OPERATION. Hank: WELL, WE GOT TO GET ON THE GOLD. WE GOT TO STAY ON THE GOLD. WE GOT TO FOLLOW THE GOLD. MIGHT HAVE BEEN DREDGED, BUT WE'LL FIND OUT HERE IN A MINUTE. BOY, THIS IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE. Narrator: LAST SUMMER, IN HIS FIRST YEAR ON THE BERING SEA... YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT REALLY ON THE GOLD LIKE I WANT TO BE. THEY'RE DIGGING RIGHT WHERE I DUG IT ALL OUT. THAT'S FUNNY. Narrator: ...HANK SPENT TOO MUCH TIME MINING GROUND THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN WORKED. SO DISAPPOINTING. NOW, TO AVOID GOING BANKRUPT... Hank: OKAY, STANLEY. HEY, SEE IF WE GOT SOME COLOR. ...HE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES. A LOT OF MINERS, THEY DO GO BROKE, BUT I GOT A PRETTY GOOD HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS, I CAN THINK AHEAD, I CAN LOOK AHEAD, I CAN SEE WHAT I GOT TO DO, WHAT CHANGES I GOT TO MAKE, AND I'M COMMITTED. WE'RE GONNA MOVE, 'CAUSE I THINK I CAN FIND SOME BETTER GOLD, BUT WE'RE JUST GONNA MOVE OVER. WE'RE GONNA MOVE OVER. EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOTHER'S DIGGING OUT HERE. Narrator: WITH THE TOMCOD CLAIM PLAYING HOST TO NEARLY 30 DREDGES, AVOIDING PICKED-OVER GROUNDS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE. YOU GET THESE LITTLE DREDGES WORKING OUT HERE, AND THEN THESE GUYS ARE ICE-DIVING OUT HERE, TOO, NOW, SO WE'RE KIND OF RUNNING INTO A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING OUT HERE. IT'S GETTING STRESSFUL FOR ME. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN DO THIS. WE'RE GONNA PULL THE SPUD UP, AND WE'RE GONNA SWING THE BOAT OVER THERE. Narrator: TO MOVE THE BARGE BACK ONTO THE GOLD, HANK MUST FIRST LIFT A 3-TON STABILIZING SPUD OFF THE OCEAN FLOOR. WAIT TILL IT STOPS! HEY! WAIT TILL IT STOPS. THAT'S THE WORST TIME THAT THAT THING COULD FALL. WAIT TILL IT STOPS, STAN. NO, YOU DIDN'T. IT WAS BOUNCING, YOU REACHED BA-- I WATCHED IT. THE GUYS DON'T WANT TO START LISTENING. I'LL JUST SHUT THIS WHOLE [BLEEP] THING DOWN AND SELL IT. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. Man: OH, MY GOD! LOOK OUT! Narrator: 7 MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR ON THE GOLD GRABBER... WAIT TILL IT STOPS! HEY! WAIT TILL IT STOPS. THAT'S THE WORST TIME THAT THAT THING COULD FALL. WAIT TILL IT STOPS, STAN. NO, YOU DIDN'T. IT WAS BOUNCING, YOU REACHED BA-- I WATCHED IT. THE GUYS DON'T WANT TO START LISTENING. I'LL JUST SHUT THIS WHOLE [BLEEP] THING DOWN AND SELL IT. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. Man: OH, MY GOD! LOOK OUT! [ GROANS ] I'M STRESSED OUT AND I'VE JUST ABOUT [BLEEP] HAD IT. I'M JUST ABOUT DONE HERE. WHEN IT STARTED TO GO, I WENT DOWN, I LAID IT DOWN, IT WAS PERFECT, BUT...IT'S TOO STRESSFUL. Narrator: AS HANK RAISED THE SPUD, HE MISJUDGED ITS POSITION, NEARLY TAKING OUT HIMSELF AND DECKHAND STAN MILLER. I THOUGHT I WAS IN THIS PEN, I WAS ACTUALLY IN THIS PEN, RAISE IT UP TO THE NEXT PEN, BOOM. THERE IS NO STOPPING THIS THING. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE A PILE-DRIVING HAMMER, IT'LL JUMP OUT ON YOU, SO YOU GOT TO BE KIND OF CAREFUL. Narrator: WITH THE SPUD ON THE DECK, MINING HAS COME TO A CRASHING HALT. I THINK I CAN GET IT IN THERE, MAYBE. WE GOT TO PICK IT UP, THEN WE CAN MUSCLE IT IN BY HAND. THEN WE'RE GONNA PLAY WITH IT A LITTLE BIT. IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL HOW WE DO IT. UNWILLING TO STOP WORKING, HANK IS ROLLING THE DICE ON A RISKY AT-SEA REPAIR. I FEEL THAT I'M PRETTY TALENTED ON THE EXCAVATOR. YOU KNOW, I HAD AN EXCAVATION COMPANY, DID WATER AND SEWER FOR 13, 14 YEARS. THOSE THOUSANDS OF HOURS ON HEAVY EQUIPMENT -- IT'S PAID OFF FOR WHAT I DO OUT HERE ON THE OCEAN. Narrator: A JOB THAT NORMALLY REQUIRES A CRANE -- HANK WILL NEED ALL HIS SKILL TO GENTLY GUIDE THE MASSIVE SPUD INTO A SLEEVE JUST 20 INCHES IN DIAMETER. WE'RE GONNA BLOW A HOLE IN HERE AND PUT A SHACKLE ON IT, SO IT DOESN'T SLIP OFF. Narrator: THE FIRST STEP -- CUTTING A HOLE IN THE EXCAVATOR BUCKET TO SECURE THE FALLEN SPUD WITH A CHAIN. Hank: ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET THIS SON OF A BITCH IN, SO WE CAN GO MINE. JUST STAND BACK AND I'LL GET IT IN. I TOOK IT OUT, I CAN PUT IT IN. PERFECT! WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT. THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS IS WE GOT IT AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO MINING. I MEAN, HE GUIDED THAT THING DOWN AT THE BEST POSSIBLE SPOT. Narrator: CRISIS AVERTED, AND THE SPUD SUCCESSFULLY BACK IN ITS SLEEVE, HANK CAN CONCENTRATE ON MOVING DIRT. ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE. NOW WE JUST GOT TO GET ON THE GOLD. IT'S DANGEROUS OUT THERE. I'M JUST GLAD THAT NOBODY GOT HURT. IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN, THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE. Narrator: BACK IN THE HARBOR... NIGHT CREW BEEN UP ALL NIGHT DIGGING, SO WE'RE GONNA GO RELIEVE THEM. Narrator: ON A MISSION TO GRAB A 100 GRAND IN GOLD FOR HIS OLD MAN'S INLAND MINING GEAR, SHAWN POMRENKE IS SKIFFING OUT TO WORK. DAD'S ALWAYS NOT REALLY LIKED THE OCEAN MINING. WE'RE BUYING ALL KINDS OF EQUIPMENT FOR INLAND MINING, BUT INLAND MINING... IF YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT GROUND, YOU CAN MAKE A HELL OF A LOT OF MONEY, QUICK. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN AND HIS DAD WENT LOADER SHOPPING, NIGHT BOSS CODY MOEN HAS KEPT THE CHRISTINE ROSE DIGGING. WE'RE ON SOME REALLY ROUGH DIGGING RIGHT NOW. THERE'S BIG BOULDERS AND CLAY AND REALLY NICE-LOOKING STUFF. THERE'S TWO SHIFTS ON THIS DREDGE -- IT'S A 24-HOUR OPERATION. YOU GOT TO HAVE A GUY RUNNING THE DAY CREW, AND YOU GOT TO HAVE A GUY RUNNING THE NIGHT CREW. CODY, HE'S YOUNG AND HE'S HUNGRY. GREAT KID. I NEED EVERYBODY ON THEIR "A" GAME BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A SHORT MINING SEASON. Cody: TAKE A LOOK-SEE. HOPEFULLY, THERE'S SOME GOLD IN HERE. HOLY [BLEEP] DUDE, IT'S THE BIGGEST NUGGET I'VE SEEN. Man: IT'S THE BIGGEST NUGGET OF THE SEASON, YEAH. YEAH. WE [BLEEP] KILLED IT. LOOK AT HOW THICK THE GOLD IS IN THERE. WE DUG FOR ABOUT 11 STRAIGHT HOURS. WE GOT SOME NICE NUGGETS, AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME COARSE GOLD UP IN THE TOP OF THAT BOX. THIS AREA THAT SHAWN GOT US ON HERE IS LOADED, AND WE GOT LOTS OF ROOM STILL TO DIG. Shawn: PILES AND PILES OF GOLD. ONE THING IS FOR SURE, WE ARE GONNA BE DOING A CLEANUP BECAUSE WE DO NEED MONEY. DAD MIGHT ACTUALLY GET THAT DOZER, AFTER ALL. IF I CAN KEEP THIS PACE UP, WE'LL HAVE ALL THAT EQUIPMENT TO GO INLAND MINING AND GO HIT IT BIG. WE'VE HAD GOOD YEARS INLAND MINING AND BAD YEARS, AND BEFORE WE COME OUT TO THE OCEAN, THERE WAS QUITE A FEW BAD YEARS OF INLAND MINING. BUT WE GOT SOME GOOD GROUND THAT DAD'S TALKING ABOUT -- I COULD SEE IT PAYING OFF BIG. WANT TO JUST RUN, RUN, AND RUN. Narrator: WITH THE BARGE ON GOOD GOLD AND INLAND MINING EQUIPMENT TO SECURE, FOR SHAWN, IT'S GO-TIME. Shawn: READY TO ROCK 'N' ROLL. GO DO ANOTHER RUN HERE. WE GOT SOME BIG NUGGETS LAST NIGHT, SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN PUT A COUPLE MORE IN THERE TODAY. NUGGETS MEAN YOU'RE IN THE GOLD, SO WE JUST NEED TO CONTINUE PUTTING DIRT THROUGH THE WASH PLANT. THE MORE DIRT WE PUT THROUGH THERE, THE MORE GOLD WE'RE GONNA GET. WOW, THIS STUFF IS LOOKING GOOD. IT LOOKS ALL SLIMY, BLACK, GOOEY, GOLD-CATCHING MATERIAL. JUST GONNA KEEP CLEARING OUT THIS WHOLE AREA. WE'RE GONNA TAKE EVERYTHING, MINE EVERYTHING. DAD JUST DROPPED $100,000, SO I'M UNDER THE GUN TO GET MORE GOLD. Narrator: WITH SHAWN DIGGING HIS WAY OUT OF DEBT, 7 MILES TO THE EAST, LEAVING NOME HARBOR... NICE, SUNSHINY DAY. NOT TOO MUCH WIND, BLUE SKIES -- I MEAN, THIS IS A BLUEBIRD DAY FOR NOME, ALASKA. Narrator: ...OWNER VERNON ADKISON AND THE WILD RANGER ARE HEADING OUT. THIS YEAR, WE INTEND TO STAY OUT THERE AROUND THE CLOCK AS LONG AS THE WEATHER LASTS. Narrator: EN ROUTE TO THE TOMCOD CLAIM, VERNON'S CREW INCUDES HIS FIRSTBORN DAUGHTER, ELAINE, AND DIVERS JUSTON COOK AND SHEM FOGELMAN. SHEM'S GONNA BE FIRST UP. HE'S OUR BIRD DOG. WE'LL PUT HIM DOWN THERE, AND HE KNOWS HOW TO GO RIGHT TO THE GOLD. HE'S ALMOST LIKE GOT GOLD MAGNETS. SHEM, WHEN HE'S DOWN THERE, HE JUST PRODUCES MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF GOLD. HE GOT A REPUTATION OF BEING A TOP DREDGER. BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM. [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] [ SMOOCHES ] ...HE'S DATING MY DAUGHTER. [ SIGHS ] SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GO EYES-ON UP FRONT AND SEE HOW THE HOSE IS HANGING AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. ELAINE, TAKE A LOOK AROUND THE BOAT. EH. Narrator: WHILE TRYING TO TURN A PROFIT WITH THE WILD RANGER, THIS SUMMER, VERNON IS ALSO WAGING A DIFFERENT KIND OF BATTLE. I'D LIKE FOR MY DAUGHTERS TO HAVE A BUSINESS THEY CAN WORK IN AND BE PRODUCTIVE AND HAS A FUTURE. BUT SOMETIMES IT'S TOUGH WORKING WITH FAMILY. TURN AND SHOW THAT FACE. DON'T DO IT! ELAINE. YOU DON'T JUST SIT AROUND AND PLAY MUGWUMPS WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND AND WHATNOT. LIKE, IF YOU SEE A JOB, GET OUT THERE AND LEND A HAND, MAKING IT FAST. Vernon: WHAT'S THAT? THIS IS, LIKE, BORDERLINE INSULTING. IT IS, ACTUALLY, INSULTING. WOULD YOU DROP THE DAMN ATTITUDE? I'M TALKING BUSINESS HERE. YOU GOT A BAD ATTITUDE, ELAINE. I'M NOT TOLERATING ANY [BLEEP] WISHY-WASHY [BLEEP] NAMBY-PAMBY BULL[BLEEP] [BLEEP] WHY DON'T YOU JUST PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND I'LL DO MY JOB? QUIT TRYING TO MICROMANAGE EVERYTHING I [BLEEP] DO HIS WHOLE LIFE. "MANY HANDS MAKE LIGHT WORK." ANY TIME YOU SEE SOMEBODY ELSE DOING A JOB, GO THERE AND PUT YOUR HAND ON IT AND HELP. I KNOW HOW TO WORK, DAD. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS ON BOATS. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS ANYWHERE! [ SIGHS ] IT'S NOT GOOD POLICY TO DATE ONE OF THE DIVERS. IT'S GONNA END UP BEING A SCREWED-UP SITUATION. ALL RIGHT, STAND BACK. ALL THOSE BUOYS OUT THERE -- THOSE RED BUOYS -- THAT'S RIGHT WHERE WE WERE LAST WINTER. WE KNOW THAT TO BE GOOD GOLD, SO WE'RE WITHIN SNIFFING DISTANCE OF IT. Narrator: AFTER 7 MILES OF NAMBY-PAMBY MUGWUMPING, IT'S FINALLY TIME TO GET SOME GOLD. REALLY HOPING TO DROP RIGHT DOWN ON THE GOLD. LET IT GO. THERE IT IS. READY? Narrator: WITH JUST 28 OUNCES BANKED TOWARDS HIS 700-OUNCE GOAL, VERNON NEEDS EVERY DIVE SHIFT TO PRODUCE. Vernon: WE'RE GONNA PLOP HIM DOWN, AND IF WE'RE LUCKY, WE'LL DROP RIGHT DOWN ON TOP OF IT. FIRST CAT OUT OF THE BOX. Shem: HERE WE GO. GETTING SOME GOLD. IF THIS KNUCKLEHEAD WANTS TO KEEP DATING MY DAUGHTER, HE'D BETTER GET DOWN THERE AND FIND ME SOME GOLD. Narrator: 7 MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... OKAY, STANLEY. WHEN I PULLED THE SPUD COMPLETELY OUT OF ITS HOLDER, I HAD TO MAKE A PRETTY QUICK DECISION ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SAFETY, AND I LAID IT DOWN ON THE DECK. VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE -- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG. Narrator: ALREADY BEHIND AFTER LOSING PRECIOUS MINING TIME FIXING HIS SPUD... Hank: ALL RIGHT, SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. ...HANK HAS MOVED THE BARGE TO NEW GROUNDS. IF THIS TEST PAN DOESN'T PAY OFF, IT'LL MEAN ANOTHER COSTLY DELAY. THAT'S IT. I SAY WE'RE ON THE GOLD. THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT PROSPECTING, LOOKING AROUND -- THAT'S A PRETTY [BLEEP] DAMN GOOD PAN RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. THAT'S THE STUFF. Hank: WE'RE ON IT RIGHT NOW. HOPEFULLY WE CAN JUST MINE IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE -- NOT BREAK A CHAIN OR BREAK DOWN -- WE CAN JUST GET SOME GOLD. BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL. A LOT OF GOLD HERE. I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, AND I'M GONNA DO IT, I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO DO IT, AND I'M GONNA GET MY 700 OUNCES THIS YEAR, MAYBE MORE. MAYBE BEAT CHRISTINE ROSE, WHO KNOWS. YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER KNOW. JUST KEEPING THIS STUFF RUNNING -- I JUST GOT TO KEEP THIS STUFF RUNNING. MAYBE THE GOLD GODS ARE ON OUR SIDE, AFTER ALL. Narrator: WHILE HANK GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS, 6 MILES TO THE EAST IN THE WEST BEACH PUBLIC MINING AREA... OKAY, SO, HOW'S IT GOING? IS EVERYTHING OKAY? Kris: EVERYTHING'S GOOD. WE GOT ABOUT 6 INCHES OF OVERBURDEN RIGHT NOW. A REALLY LIGHT, DECENT CLOUD. Narrator: FOR FOUR HOURS, DIVER KRIS KELLY'S BEEN HUNTING THROUGH SLIM PICKINGS, LOOKING FOR PAYDAY. I BET YOU WE'RE GONNA FIND A HOT SPOT. I THINK I SEE A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD. IT'S CLOUDY, BUT... I THINK THAT IS GOLD. THAT'S NOT A LOT, BUT, YOU KNOW, EVERY COUPLE INCHES IF YOU FIND SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU WILL PAY SOME BILLS, LET ME TELL YOU. OH. HEY, I THINK ANDY LEFT ONE DAY TOO EARLY. MAYBE THE BAD LUCK LEFT THE BOAT AFTER ALL THE BAD KARMA. THERE'S A LOT OF FINE HERE. ♪ OH, KRIS IS ON THE GOLD ♪ Narrator: FINALLY, FINDING A SPOT WITH GOLD -- ALL THAT'S LEFT IS TO SUCK IT UP. 1,000 BUCKS A DAY TIMES 100 DAYS OF DIVING IS $100,000. $100,000 A YEAR, YOU KNOW, HANGING OUT IN THE WATER IS PRETTY GOOD. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH SUCTION OR SOMETHING, DAD. I'M NOT EVEN MOVING A LOT OF MATERIAL. IT FEELS LIKE I GOT A ROCK JAM. YOU NEED THE HAMMER? I'LL GET IT AS IT GOES UP, BUT EVERY FOOT I DO, IT GETS CLOGGED AGAIN. THIS STUBBORN [BLEEP] THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS HOSE. Narrator: THIS IS NOT KRIS' FIRST RUN-IN WITH HIS DAD'S SHODDY EQUIPMENT. OVER THE WINTER... ...BRAD'S BARGAIN-BASEMENT GEAR WAS A CONSTANT THORN IN KRIS' SIDE. I THINK HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WOMAN AT BIRTH, 'CAUSE HE SURE COMPLAINS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL HALF THE TIME, YOU KNOW. THIS [BLEEP] PIECE OF [BLEEP] Narrator: DIFFERENT BOATS, SAME SONG AND DANCE. THE ROCK JAM LOOKS LIKE IT'S CLEARED. WE'RE GETTING GOOD FLOW. Kris: THERE, THAT'S GOOD. THERE'S SOME GOLD IN THE OVERBURDEN AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, I'M REALLY ON THE GOLD TODAY. SURE, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I GOT A ROCK JAM. I DON'T KNOW HOW -- I'M NOT EVEN WORKING MATERIAL. I'M NOT PUTTING ONE BIG ROCK UP THE HOSE. NOT EVEN ONE. FLOWING GOOD UP HERE. AND A BUNCH OF BIG ONES CAME OUT. NO, I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT IT. I CAN. THEY'RE $1,800. I'LL HAVE ONE HERE RIGHT AWAY. $1,800. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALWAYS BEEN EXCUSED WHY IT'S THIS, WHY IT'S THAT. WHY CAN'T IT BE COMFORTABLE TO WORK DOWN HERE? WHY DO I HAVE TO BE A [BLEEP] AND ALWAYS HAVE TO JERK AROUND WITH THIS STUPID, GARBAGE EQUIPMENT? I DON'T WANT YOUR [BLEEP] LECTURE, OKAY? Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME ON THE REAPER... Kris: YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALWAYS BEEN EXCUSED WHY IT'S THIS, WHY IT'S THAT. WHY CAN'T IT BE COMFORTABLE TO WORK DOWN HERE? WHY DO I HAVE TO BE A [BLEEP] AND ALWAYS HAVE TO JERK AROUND WITH THIS STUPID, GARBAGE EQUIPMENT? I DON'T WANT YOUR [BLEEP] LECTURE, OKAY? Narrator: ...ROCK JAMS AND A CUT-RATE SUCTION HOSE ARE GETTING THE BEST OF KRIS KELLY. LET'S PACK IT UP 'CAUSE IT'S GETTING ROUGH UP HERE. YEAH, IT IS. YEAH, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. HE'S PAYING FOR IT. YEAH, RIGHT. HEY, IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL ROUGH? YEAH, I TOLD YOU IT'S ROUGH. YOU'RE A [BLEEP] WIMP. WELL, I DIDN'T SAY COME UP. YOU'RE BITCHING ABOUT "HOSE, HOSE, HOSE, WE NEED A NEW HOSE." WE DO, YOU... RIGHT NOW, IN ORDER FOR ME TO DO MY JOB, I NEED TO INVEST MY OWN MONEY, 'CAUSE MY DAD'S NOT GONNA PUT ONE [BLEEP] DIME IN IT. I'M UNDER A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS. I HAVE MY MOM DEPENDING ON ME. EITHER THE BOAT'S GONNA GO THE WAY I WANT IT, OR I'M GONNA HAVE TO [BLEEP] QUIT, 'CAUSE MY DAD'S JUST GONNA TAKE ME DOWN WITH HIM, AND I'M NOT GONNA MAKE ANY GOLD. AND I'M NOT LETTING THAT HAPPEN TO ME. YEAH, IT'S SO ROUGH NOBODY ELSE IS GOING IN. WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO IN. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO. IT IS ROUGH, YOU KNOW. I'M SORRY YOU DON'T SEE IT LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NO, I'M NOT. YOU WANT TO GO BACK DOWN DIVING, I'M FINE. WHY? YOU'RE THE ONE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THE HOSE. YEAH, THE HOSE IS [BLEEP] IT'S A PIECE OF [BLEEP] I'M SICK OF TIRED OF IT. LET'S GO BACK, RESET ANCHOR. I'M COOL TO STAY OUT HERE ALL DAY. THEN WHAT WERE YOU FREAKING OUT ABOUT? I'M NOT. IT'S YOU [BLEEP] STRESSING ME OUT CONSTANTLY. LET'S JUST GO BACK IN. I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ANY MORE TODAY. LET'S JUST GO BACK IN. Brad: THERE'S NO PROBLEMS WITH THE DREDGE. IT'S THE BEST DREDGE OUT THERE, BUT KRIS' DEMEANOR -- DUDE, HE GOES FROM ZERO TO 500 IN TWO SECONDS. HE CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANY ISSUES, HE JUST WANTS TO BLOW UP. THE GUY HAS THE TEMPERAMENT OF A [BLEEP] MONKEY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I DON'T KNOW IF HIS MOTHER DROPPED HIM ON HIS HEAD WHEN HE WAS LITTLE OR WHAT, YOU KNOW. Narrator: WHILE THE FIGHTING KELLYS PACK IT IN FOR THE DAY, 7 MILES WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Shem: WE SEEM TO BE MINING IN AN AREA WHERE THE CHRISTINE ROSE HAS BEEN, BUT YOU KNOW OUR THEORY HERE -- THERE'S PROBABLY SOME GOOD GOLD. Narrator: AFTER SIX HOURS, VERNON'S POTENTIAL SON-IN-LAW, SHEM FOGELMAN, IS STILL HUNTING FOR A PAY STREAK. Vernon: WHEN ELAINE FIRST STARTED DATING SHEM, I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, AND I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HIRED HIM IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT. BUT EVERY TIME HE'S BEEN DOWN THERE, HE'S COME UP WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GOLD. BEING ON THE GOLD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, TO ME. RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK IN BETWEEN THE SCOOPS, OR OUTSIDE OF THEM, TO SEE WHAT WE GOT. [ GRUNTS ] [BLEEP] COME ON, GOLD, WHERE YOU BE? Narrator: FOR VERNON, REGARDLESS OF WHOSE BOYFRIEND YOU ARE, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT MATTERS. YOU SEE ANY GOLD DOWN THERE YET? Shem: NICE-LOOKING BOTTOM. OH [BLEEP] LOOK AT THAT. CHUNKY, LOOK AT THAT. OH! EVERYWHERE. OKAY, WELL, THAT'S THE BEST NEWS I HEARD ALL DAY. ALL RIGHT. GOOD SHOW. Vernon: ACCORDING TO WHAT HE'S SEEING DOWN THERE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ON A GOOD SPOT HERE. SO WHEN I HEAR THAT HE'S SEEING IT DOWN THERE, IT MAKES ME FEEL A DAMN SIGHT BETTER. THAT MAKES IT ALL SEEM WORTHWHILE. GOT TO GET THAT, GET THAT GOLD, BOY! OH, YEAH. THAT'S THE GOOD STUFF, RIGHT HERE. THAT'S PRETTY FANTASTIC. YOU KNOW THE NAME OF THE GAME, ELAINE. WHAT. [ SIGHS ] Narrator: WHILE VERNON'S DIVER IS SUCKING UP A PAYDAY, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOME, AT THE POMRENKE CLEANUP SHACK... Shawn: START THE WATER. ON THE GOLD. THAT'S THE GOLD DANCE.
