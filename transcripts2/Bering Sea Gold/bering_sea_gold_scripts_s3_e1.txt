 Narrator: ...THE CENTER OF THE GOLD-MINING UNIVERSE. Vernon: THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF TONS OF GOLD OUT THERE. IT'S WORTH ABOUT $2.5 BILLION. Narrator: EVERY WINTER, DARING MINERS CUT HOLES IN THE ICE, FIRE UP THEIR SLUICE BOXES, AND RISK THEIR LIVES IN THE 25-DEGREE BERING SEA FOR A CHANCE TO STRIKE IT RICH. Shawn: SOMETIMES, YOU GO, "WHY IN THE HELL AM I DOING THIS?" BUT THIS IS WHAT I LOVE TO DO. AM I GONNA SIT IN AN OFFICE AND PUSH PAPERS, OR AM I GONNA BE OUT HERE, FINDING GOLD? I LOVE MY JOB. Narrator: FOR THOSE TOUGH ENOUGH... 2014 ICE MINING. LET'S GO. Narrator: ...FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD. Shawn: ICE IS THIN AS HELL THIS YEAR. HOPEFULLY, WE DON'T FALL THROUGH. Zeke: IT'S WHAT GETS MINERS OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING, IS THAT THEY'RE GAMBLERS. "WELL, MAYBE TODAY WILL BE THE DAY. WILL I HIT IT BIG?" Narrator: IN A SHORT SEASON, MINERS ARE FOCUSING ON TWO OFF-SHORE CLAIMS KNOWN TO BE RICH IN GOLD -- THE TINY CLAIM 14, JUST ONE MILE EAST OF THE HARBOR, AND THE TOMCOD CLAIM, LOCATED SEVEN MILES WEST OF TOWN. IT MAY LOOK LIKE WINTER, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GOLD SEASON. Narrator: ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... [ ENGINE REVVING ] Shawn: MR. GOLD'S GONNA MAKE SOME GOLD TODAY. [ CHUCKLES ] ...SHAWN POMRENKE AND THE SHAMROCK ARE BACK IN ACTION. Shawn: HOPEFULLY, WE'LL GO DOWN THERE AND GET RIGHT ON THE GOLD. AFTER LAST WINTER, WE CAN'T DO ANY WORSE. Narrator: ONE YEAR AGO... WE GOT A LOT TO DO IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. Narrator: ...A LATE START... Steve P.: BUSTED PIECES FROM THE PUMP DRIVE. ...AND A BROKEN DRIVE SHAFT RUINED THE POMRENKE SEASON. Shawn: LOOK AT ALL THOSE DAMN NUGGETS. LOOK HOW SHINY THAT IS. BUT A $1.1 MILLION SUMMER BROUGHT REDEMPTION AND A NEW NICKNAME. THEY DON'T CALL ME "MR. GOLD" FOR NOTHING. Narrator: IF HE WANTS TO KEEP THE TITLE, HE'LL HAVE TO FINALLY TURN A PROFIT WITH HIS $100,000 WINTER DREDGE. I THINK I'M GONNA GET 'EM. WE'LL BE ROCKING AND ROLLING, PUT GOLD IN THE BOX TOMORROW. Narrator: JOINING THE SHAMROCK A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY... Vernon: ALL RIGHT. 1, 2, 3, GO. WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON ONCE AGAIN GUNNING FOR A COMEBACK. BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. ENGINE ROOM MOVED INTO PLACE. MOVED THE SLUICE BOX INTO PLACE. AND PROBABLY IN A COUPLE HOURS, WE'LL BE READY TO GO MINING. Narrator: FOR THREE SEASONS... ...VERNON HAS SPENT OVER $1 MILLION CHASING GOLD. NO GOLD. THERE'S VERY MINOR GOLD. ...BUT HAS COLLECTED JUST 105 OUNCES. I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THIS IS GONNA PAY OFF FOR US. Vernon: LAST SEASON IN THE SUMMER WAS NOT A SUCCESSFUL SEASON, AND LAST WINTER WASN'T, EITHER. CALLING IT QUITS AND GOING HOME CROSSED MY MIND, BUT I ROLLED A LOT OF MONEY INTO THIS OPERATION. WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE THIS, I'M NOT HALF-STEPPING. EITHER I'M GONNA MAKE IT IN A FAIRLY BIG WAY, OR I'M GONNA BE TOAST. WE GOT A RIG HERE THAT'S PRETTY DAMN NICE. IT'S A HONKING MACHINE. Narrator: VERNON'S HONKING MACHINE INCLUDES AN 8x16-FOOT ENGINEERING ROOM ON SKIS, A 24-FOOT CLEANUP SHACK, TOPSIDE SLUICE BOX CONNECTED TO 60 FEET OF HOSE, AND A STATE-OF-THE-ART COMMUNICATION STATION. Vernon: I PICKED IT UP FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE TRANSMISSION IS SHOT, BUT THE ENGINE RUNS GOOD, THE HEATER WORKS GOOD. VERN OVER THERE WITH PILES OF [BLEEP] EVERYWHERE. CLEAN YOUR SPOT UP. Vernon: BEEN A LONG TIME PUTTING IT TOGETHER, AND, YOU KNOW, FINGERS CROSSED IT'S GONNA WORK. Narrator: WHILE THE SHAMROCK AND WILD RANGER RACE TO GET ON THE GOLD, EIGHT MILES UP THE COAST, ON CLAIM 14... Zeke: BE MY FIRST TIME DOWN THIS WINTER. I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT. Narrator: ...THE REIGNING WINTER GOLD CHAMPION, ZEKE TENHOFF, IS FINALLY RETURNING TO FULL-TIME MINING. THIS PAST SUMMER, I GOT A LITTLE ROWDY AND GOT KIND OF MIXED UP WITH THE PO-PO. Narrator: LAST SUMMER, FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF HIS BEST FRIEND, ZEKE'S LIFE SPUN OUT OF CONTROL... THEY DRAG ME OUT OF THE COP CAR, AND THEY WRESTLE ME DOWN TO THE GROUND LIKE THIS AND HOLD MY HEAD DOWN LIKE THIS. ...ENDING WITH AN ARREST FOR MULTIPLE FELONIES. [ LAUGHS ] I HAVE A COURT DATE FOR MY FINAL SENTENCING NEXT WEEK. AND, REALLY, THE ONLY THING BETWEEN ME AND GOING TO JAIL IS THIS EXPENSIVE LAWYER THAT I HAVE, WHO'S A GREAT GUY. BUT HE NEEDS TO GET PAID, AND HE'S COMING TO TOWN NEXT WEEK. Narrator: TO BUY HIS FREEDOM, ZEKE IS PAYING MORE THAN ONE STEEP PRICE. THE OTHER? ZEKE DOESN'T HAVE IT BAD. HE CAN'T COMPLAIN. HE'S GOT THE BEST MINING PARTNER OUT HERE. Narrator: WORKING FOR SELF-PROCLAIMED SUPER DREDGER GLEN LeBARON AND DOING EVERYTHING BY HIS RULES. THIS IS THE MISS NOMER. IT'S, LIKE, COMPLETELY MY IDEA. EVERYTHING WE DID HERE WAS IN LIEU OF, LIKE, ZEKE GETTING HIS WAY. THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO EL DORADO, WHERE ALL THE GOLD'S AT. THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT TO BE INDOORS. Narrator: GLEN'S PLAN IS TO DIVE IN THE OPEN AIR, JUST LIKE HE'S ALWAYS DONE WHILE RIVER MINING. Zeke: I DON'T LIKE BEING COLD, ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE, YOU KNOW, DOING A LOT OF NIGHT DIVING AND IF THE TEMPERATURE DROPS, AND WHO KNOWS? GLEN HAS A LOT OF DREDGING EXPERIENCE. BUT THE FACT IS, HE DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE OCEAN UP HERE. YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. Glen: ZEKE RECENTLY BROUGHT OUT THIS OTHER ICE SHACK, WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE LAST WEEK. Narrator: AT ZEKE'S REQUEST, GLEN HAS AGREED TO A SECOND RELIEF HOLE INSIDE AN 8x16-FOOT DIVE SHACK. HERE ME TALKING [BLEEP] ZEKE? NOTHING. ZEKE AND I RESPECT EACH OTHER AS MINERS. BUT I'M ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GOLD DREDGERS ON THE PLANET. ZEKE IS STILL A BEGINNER. I WOULDN'T CONSIDER ZEKE ANYWHERE NEAR ME, BECAUSE I'VE SPENT SO MUCH MORE TIME DREDGING THAN ZEKE HAS. Narrator: THIS SEASON, THE BOYS WILL BE MINING WITH GLEN'S ONE-OF-A-KIND INVENTION -- AN UNDERWATER DREDGE HE NAMED "THE DRAGON." HEY, WHAT'S THE STATUS? YOU HAVE THE NOZZLE? Let's get this party started, man. ALL RIGHT, YEAH. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] WE'RE ABOUT TO GET SOME GOLD. WHOO! THE SAND IS SO FINE AND SO DENSE, IT CREATES AN ARTIFICIAL HARD PAN. JUST, YOU KNOW [BLEEP] DANCE, SEA MONKEY, DANCE. ZEKE MAY OR MAY NOT REALIZE THE FACT THAT HE'S WORKING WITH ME IS GONNA ALLOW HIM TO JUMP, LIKE, YEARS IN ADVANCE. AS LONG AS ZEKE LISTENS TO ME, WE'RE GONNA DO REALLY WELL THIS SEASON. I'VE GOT LEGITIMATE CREDIBILITY THAT I'VE REALLY WORKED HARD TO EARN. YOU KNOW, IF ANYONE WANTS TO [BLEEP] PISS ME OFF, ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TELL ME THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT OR THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DREDGE, AND I'M GONNA BE REALLY [BLEEP] PISSED OFF. Narrator: BACK IN TOWN... I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT OUR GOAL IS TO GET ON THE ICE TOMORROW. THE SIDE'S ALMOST DONE WELDED. WE'LL GET THAT SIDE DONE WELDED. AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO, SECOND DAY. ...WHILE OTHER CREWS ARE ALREADY ON THE ICE, EMILY RIEDEL, THE ONLY FEMALE DREDGE OWNER IN THE FLEET, IS STILL PUTTING HER RIG TOGETHER. I'M LATE GETTING OUT HERE. YOU KNOW, I ENDED REALLY STRONGLY LAST SEASON, AND WE GOT A LOT OF GOLD, AND THAT WAS AMAZING. BUT THIS IS MY FIRST TIME AS A CAPTAIN DURING THE ICE SEASON. I HAVE SO MUCH TO PROVE. Narrator: LAST SUMMER... IF THIS IS A TEST AS A FIRST-TIME CAPTAIN, I THINK I'M FAILING. Narrator: ...AFTER EMILY'S DIVERS QUIT MID-SEASON... [ IMITATES BUGS BUNNY ] THAT'S ALL, FOLKS. Narrator: ...SHE PICKED UP A NEW TEAM... YOU STILL SEEING SOME GOLD? ...AND PULLED OFF A 109-OUNCE COMEBACK. [ LAUGHS ] YOU DOUBTING [BLEEP] OUT THERE. MY JOURNEY OF BEING IN NOME HAS GONE FROM BEING ABSOLUTELY BROKE AND LIVING IN A BEACH SHACK TO OWNING MY OWN DREDGE. AND NOW I WANT MORE. BUT I WANT TO BE THE BEST NOME GOLD DREDGER THAT EVER EXISTED. Narrator: AFTER PAYING OFF HER SUMMER DREDGE, SHE'S GONE BACK INTO DEBT TO BUY TOP-OF-THE-LINE ICE-MINING GEAR. THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE MOST LEGIT DIVE HEATER IN NOME. I GUARANTEE IT. MY OPERATION SO FAR HAS COST ME ABOUT $50,000. MY GOAL THIS SEASON WAS TO ASSEMBLE THE MOST PROFESSIONAL COMMERCIAL DIVING OPERATION EVER. Tony: SHE MUST HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN US AS CREW TO SINK THIS MUCH MONEY IN NEW EQUIPMENT, DOWN TO HER LAST DIME. Narrator: EMILY'S BETTING THE HOUSE ON COMMERCIAL DIVE EQUIPMENT, BUT HER BIGGEST GAMBLE IS ON A SECRET WEAPON... FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, WE'RE USING A SUBMERSIBLE DREDGE, AND IT WAS DESIGNED FOR US BY ROB, WHO WORKED WITH GLEN AND ZEKE LAST YEAR. Narrator: ...THE PROTOTYPE FOR A NEW UNDERWATER RECOVERY SYSTEM BASED ON GLEN'S DESIGN FOR THE DRAGON. Emily: NOW, THE BEAUTY OF THIS THING IS THAT IT'S ON THE STAND AND IT SWIVELS. WE HAVE A 360-DEGREE RADIUS. MY GOAL IS TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT RECOVERS GOLD BETTER THAN GLEN'S DRAGON. WHATEVER GLEN IS DOING UP HERE, I JUST WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S BETTER. YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOOD AT SLAYING DRAGONS. IT'S GONNA BE THE DESOLATION OF GLEN. HE THINKS HE'S GOT THE DRAGON. WELL, WE GOT THE SLAYER, SO IT'S ALL GOOD. WE'RE DELAYED GETTING OUT. EVERYONE'S GOT A HEAD START. HOPEFULLY, ONCE WE GET THIS THING GOING... [ LAUGHS ] I'D SAY IT'S A GOOD THING THEY GOT A HEAD START, 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BLOW THEM OUT OF THE [BLEEP] ICE. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... THERE YOU GO! ...FOR THE FIRST TIME AS DREDGE OWNERS, THE KELLY FAMILY IS HITTING THE ICE. Kris: WE'RE GONNA GET OUT THERE, PUNCH A COUPLE HOLES. YOU KNOW, WITH THE LUCK OF THE IRISH, WE'RE GONNA GET ON THE GOLD THIS AFTERNOON. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT HAPPENS FOR US. Brad: THE REAPER ICE DREDGE IS 13 FEET TALL, 13 FEET WIDE, 26 FEET LONG. IF WE GET 50 GRAND A WEEK, WE'LL BE HAPPY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AFTER OUR FAILING SEASON WITH STEVE, WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. Narrator: LAST SEASON... WE'RE OUT OF HERE. WE'RE DONE. WE'RE DONE. TOO MUCH WAVES. ...BRAD AND HIS TWO SONS, KRIS AND ANDY... HERE IS YOUR GOLD, ANDY. ...GOT LESS THAN 9 OUNCES... THAT'S PITIFUL. ...WORKING FOR STEVE RIEDEL. EVERYBODY STILL ASSOCIATES ME WITH WORKING ON THE MINNOW AND GETTING NO [BLEEP] GOLD. YEAH, IT'S A PRETTY [BLEEP] FEELING, YOU KNOW. LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY. THAT'S SHAWN'S OVER THERE TO THE RIGHT. THAT'S VERN. SO WE'RE GONNA GO 300 YARDS TO THE LEFT OF THEM. WE'RE LIKE THIS [BLEEP] CLOSE TO MAKING SOME MONEY, AND I AM SUPER EXCITED. Narrator: NOW THE FIGHTING IRISH HAVE COBBLED TOGETHER THE CHEAPEST DREDGE ON THE ICE, THE REAPER. Brad: THAT'S IT, MAN. I'M ON ICE, TOO. FOR THE ICE SHACK, YOU HAVE $1,200 FOR THE WOOD. I DID ALL THE LABOR. SHIPPED HERE WAS ANOTHER $300. SO, YOU KNOW, UNDER 2 GRAND FOR THE ICE SHACK. LOOKS REAL GHETTO FABULOUS IN HERE, BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES. Kris: WE'RE KIND OF OUR OWN WORST ENEMY, BUT WHEN WE HAVE AN ENEMY IN COMMON, WE'RE [BLEEP] GREAT. WE'RE, LIKE, UNITED. WE'RE A FAMILY. BUT WHEN WE ONLY HAVE OURSELVES TO GO AGAINST, IT'S LIKE, "JESUS," YOU KNOW. THAT'S WHEN WE KILL EACH OTHER. GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF THE WAY. Narrator: UNLIKE THEIR NEW NEIGHBORS OVER ON THE SHAMROCK... ICE HOLES ARE A CAKEWALK THIS YEAR. Narrator: ...FOR THE REAPER BOYS... YOU [BLEEP] PIECE OF [BLEEP] Narrator: ...DIVE HOLES ARE A WEE BIT COMPLICATED. Kris: GO! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. SECOND ATTEMPT RIGHT NOW. OKAY, HOLD IT. OKAY, GO! GO AGAIN. WOW. YOU KNOW, IF IT WAS EASY, EVERYBODY WOULD BE DOING IT. GO! WHOA. I'M OKAY, EVERYBODY. THANKS FOR [BLEEP] WONDERING. Narrator: WHILE THE KELLYS SLUG IT OUT WITH AN ICE CUBE, EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST... ...AFTER SIX HOURS OF DREDGING, ZEKE IS CHECKING IN ON THE FRUITS OF HIS LABOR. LOTS OF GOLD? OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU AT THE DIVE HOLE. THIS HOLE IS REALLY SMALL. [ CHUCKLES ] FIRST DAY DOWN, AND I'M STAYING ON SOME PRETTY DECENT GOLD. IT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT, AND I THINK IT'LL PILE UP. LAST YEAR, GLEN AND I AND THE REST OF OUR ICE TEAM DID BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE, AND, I MEAN, THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE'LL DO THAT AGAIN. IT'S OKAY WHEN IT'S WARM. BEING WARM IS FOR WIMPS. OR IF YOU'RE OUT HERE BY YOURSELF AND THE HOLE FREEZERS OVER SO MUCH YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH IT. THAT WOULD BE [BLEEP] BUT IF YOU'RE, LIKE, OUT OF AIR. BUT SAFETY IS OVERRATED, RIGHT? WELL, YEAH. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT DOWN THERE. KNOCK MYSELF OUT SOME BIG NUGGETS. I DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TREPIDATION ABOUT MY PARTNERSHIP WITH GLEN. I WON'T LIE. AND, YOU KNOW, I CAN TELL THAT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR GLEN TO WORK WITH ME, AS WELL. Narrator: FOR GLEN'S SHIFT, HE'S BROUGHT OUT HIS GIRLFRIEND... GETTING COLD OUT. ...JASMIN GEORGE, TO TEND. THE NICE THING ABOUT DREDGING WITH GIRLS IS THEY DON'T WANT TO DREDGE. SO, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST SHOW UP AND TRY TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASY, AND THEN WE CAN JUST FOCUS ON DREDGING. I'M TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR LAST SUMMER THIS WINTER, AND ALL THE MONEY THAT I COULD HAVE MADE LAST SUMMER NEEDS TO BE MADE NOW SO THIS COMING SUMMER WILL BE THE WAY IT NEEDS TO BE. Narrator: AS GLEN GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS, EIGHT MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Vernon: OKAY, LET'S DO IT. Narrator: ...CAPTAIN VERNON HAS THE WILD RANGER READY FOR ITS MAIDEN DREDGE OF THE SEASON. WE'RE MINING. NO BULL[BLEEP] ABOUT IT. WE'RE HERE TO GET THE GOLD. I ASSEMBLED THE FINEST CREW THAT THERE IS IN NOME. MY DAUGHTER ELAINE IS BACK THIS YEAR. JUSTON -- HE'S A COMMERCIAL DIVER AND HAS BEEN FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. AND SPENSER RECENTLY CAME ABOARD. HE'S JUST AN ALL-AROUND, CAN-DO-ANYTHING KIND OF GUY. AND HE'S PRETTY DAMN EASY TO GET ALONG WITH, UNLIKE JASON. HE KNOWS HE'S A ROYAL PAIN THE ASS. VERN AND I ALWAYS END UP SAYING, "ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. NO MORE." YOU KNOW, "WE'RE NOT WORKING TOGETHER ANYMORE." AND THEN, INEVITABLY, I END UP COMING RIGHT BACK. VERN, I CAN'T WORK ON THE WILD RANGER. Narrator: AFTER QUITTING AS A DECK HAND... Vernon: LET'S GO. I'LL TAKE YOU BACK TO YOUR HOUSE. I'LL GET SOMEBODY OUT HERE THAT CAN [BLEEP] DO THE JOB. ...AND BEING FIRED AS A DECK HAND... LOOKS GOOD. ...JASON WALKER HAS BEEN GIVEN YET ANOTHER CHANCE... THIS TIME AROUND, I'M NOT FOLLOWING SOMEONE ELSE. I'M NOT -- YOU KNOW, I'M LEADING THIS CREW. Narrator: ...AND, NATURALLY, A PROMOTION. MY MAN JASON CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN TO PUT THIS EQUIPMENT TOGETHER. JASON AND I DO TEND TO HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT I KNOW HIM TO BE A DEDICATED MINER, A VERY HARD WORKER. I MEAN, HE'S IMPERVIOUS TO PAIN. I MEAN, I BELIEVE YOU COULD BEAT HIM IN THE HEAD WITH A BALL-PEEN HAMMER. IT WOULDN'T EVEN PHASE HIM. HE PICKED OUT THIS SPOT. HE GUARANTEES THERE'S GOLD DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT HOLE. AND WE'RE GONNA SEE JUST WHAT KIND OF A GOLD FINDER HE IS, IF HE'S BULL[BLEEP] OR IF HE'S THE MAN. IF HE'S THE MAN, I'LL ADMIT IT. I'M A KICK-BUTT DREDGER, AND I KNOW HOW TO FIND GOLD. THIS PAST SUMMER, I WORKED ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S DREDGE. WE DID REALLY WELL IN ONE TIGHT LITTLE SPOT, AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDANT THAT I CAN GET US RIGHT DOWN ON THE GOLD. GO FIND ME SOME GOLD. FIND US SOME GOLD. OKAY, JASON. HE PICKED THIS SPOT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE ULTIMATE CONSIDERATION, RIGHT THERE. THE MAIN THING IS TO GET THE GOLD. Narrator: ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM, THE WILD RANGER WINS THE RACE TO GET IN THE WATER. SPEAKING OF WHICH... GO! YEAH, BABY! THAT'S WHAT WE'RE [BLEEP] TALKING ABOUT. 53-TIME LUCKY. Narrator: ...AFTER THREE HOURS, THE KELLY BOYS ARE ONE STEP CLOSER. BACK AT THE MISS NOMER... GLEN: Hey, Jasmin, the gold's really awesome. YEAH, I'M ON THIS PRETTY HARD-PACKED SAND. I'M SEEING A LOT OF GOOD GOLD ON IT. OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU'RE ON THE HOT SPOT. ...AFTER FIVE HOURS, GLEN AND JASMIN ARE WORKING LATE INTO THE NIGHT. YEAH, I'M SEEING GOLD ON MULTIPLE PAY LAYERS HERE. THERE'S GOLD ON THIS CLAY. THERE'S GOLD ON THIS SAND. THE CLAY RUNS INTO THE SILT, AND THEN THE SILT RUNS INTO THE GRAVEL. AND THERE'S JUST GOLD EVERYWHERE AROUND HERE. Narrator: AT THE MISS NOMER... I'M RIGHT HERE. OKAY. ...AFTER NEARLY SIX HOURS UNDER THE ICE, GLEN LeBARON'S DIVE HOLE IS FROZEN SHUT. GLEN: Jas! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] HOLY [BLEEP] GOD. UGH. ZEKE'S ICE-SHACK RELIEF HOLE, THE SAME ONE GLEN DIDN'T SEE A NEED FOR, JUST SAVED HIS LIFE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO -- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU COULDN'T SEE THIS HOLE. YEAH, WE'VE... WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A LIGHT OVER HERE AT ALL TIMES. [ GROANS ] WHOA. THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF GOLD THAT'S WORTH DYING FOR. JUST BEFORE I REALIZED I WAS FROZEN IN, I WAS ON REALLY AWESOME GOLD. THAT'S WHEN THINGS ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS, BECAUSE YOU'RE SO DISTRACTED, AND THAT'S WHEN THINGS CAN GO WRONG. Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Shawn: MR. GOLD HERE. FIRST DIVE OF THE SEASON. SHAWN'S GONNA HOP DOWN AND GO CHECK THIS SPOT OUT, SEE IF THERE'S ANY GOLD. Narrator: ...IT'S TIME TIME FOR THE INAUGURAL DIVE ON THE SHAMROCK. Shawn: YOU ALWAYS WANT TO COME OUT ON TOP. THE NUMBERS AT THE END OF THE SEASON SHOW WHO THE BEST DREDGER IS. IF YOU'RE THE BEST DREDGER, YOU NEED TO GET MORE GOLD THAN ME. I'M MR. GOLD. LITTLE BIT ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT'S DOWN HERE. SPENT OVER $100,000 ON THIS DREDGE, BUT THAT'S THE GAMBLE YOU TAKE WHEN YOU GOLD MINE. TIME TO GO MAKE SOME GOLD. [ GROWLS ] I SEE SOME COBBLE OVER THIS WAY I'M GONNA GO CHECK OUT. VIS IS PRETTY GOOD. GO AHEAD, FLARE THE PUMP UP. Cody: HOW DEEP'S THAT SAND LOOKING? IS IT GETTING DEEP, OR IS IT JUST KIND OF COVERING THE COBBLE? EASY WORKINGS. Narrator: AS SHAWN'S $100,000 RIG GETS ROLLING, 300 YARDS AWAY... Brad: SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN DOWN THERE? MY PLAN IS TO GET A LOT OF GOLD AND WORK HARD. ...THE CHEAPEST DREDGE ON THE ICE IS ALSO FIRING UP. IT'S [BLEEP] COLD. I THINK IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT REALLY GOOD. WE'RE ON A RICH AREA. ALL I GOT TO DO DOWN THERE IS PUT IN SOME HOURS. Narrator: FOR THE REAPER, IT'S ALL SYSTEMS GO... ...MOST OF THE SYSTEMS, ANYWAY. HERE WE GO. YOU READY? COME ON. PRETTY GHETTO. JUST DON'T ROLL OVER ON YOUR SIDE, OR ONE SIDE WILL FLIP OFF. WITH NO WORKING COMMUNICATIONS AND A WEIGHT BELT MADE FROM A GARDEN HOSE, THE FIGHTING KELLYS ARE READY TO DIVE. WHAT'S MY GOAL FOR THE SEASON? 15 OUNCES FOR MYSELF. LIKE, $18,000 FOR A MONTH AND A HALF OF WORK I CONSIDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. 2 OUNCES TODAY. AT LEAST $1,000 I'M GONNA MAKE. WE GOT THIS MASK FROM THE GOODWILL, SO BE GRATEFUL WE GOT ONE. GET THE DAMN GOLD. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. KRIS IS DOWN, FINALLY. I HOPE HE GETS A LOT OF GOLD. I AT LEAST HOPE HE CAN EARN HIS KEEP TODAY, YOU KNOW. Narrator: THE REAPER IS THE CLOSEST TO THE SHORELINE, DREDGING IN AN AREA NO DEEPER THAN A BACKYARD SWIMMING POOL. BOX ISN'T CHANGING COLORS YET. Narrator: BATTLING BOTH THE ELEMENTS AND THE FAMILY BUDGET, KRIS IS DIVING IN THE MOST DANGEROUS CONDITIONS IMAGINABLE. YEAH, THERE WE GO THERE. I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE ANY RIPPLES OR ANYTHING. THAT'S WHAT I WANT. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ALASKA... A LITTLE TOBACCO CALMS THE NERVES. Narrator: ...AFTER FIVE HOURS OF DREDGING IN DANGEROUSLY SHALLOW WATER, KRIS KELLY IS HEADED BACK TOPSIDE. BUT THE LOW TIDE HAS DROPPED THE OVERHEAD ICE DOWN TO JUST TWO FEET OF CLEARANCE. AS KRIS STRUGGLES TO MAKE IT BACK TO SAFETY, TOPSIDE, HIS DAD AND BROTHER ARE COMPLETELY UNAWARE. YOU NOT FEELING IT TODAY, OR WHAT? HUH? EASY. IF WE EVER HAVE TO DO AN EMERGENCY ASCENT, WE'RE [BLEEP] DEAD. WHY? BECAUSE THAT CAN'T COME OFF. THERE'S LIKE THAT MUCH TO GET IN BETWEEN. YOU CAN'T [BLEEP] SEE. HOW LOW IS IT RIGHT NOW, THE GAP? LIKE 2½ FEET. LIKE THAT [BLEEP] BIG, MAN. I'M JIGGLING INSIDE. I GOT THAT [BLEEP] WEIGHT BELT ON. THESE KIDS, YOU KNOW, THEY EXAGGERATE EVERY SITUATION. BACK IN 1952 OR '40, THEY DIDN'T HAVE A COMM BOX TO TALK TO THE DIVER. THEY GAVE A COUPLE YARDS ON THE LINE, UP YOU CAME. ANDY, BE CAREFUL, MAN. BECAUSE IT'S -- IT'S REAL [BLEEP] DANGEROUS. I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU ONLY GOT A [BLEEP] ENTRANCE THIS BIG. IT'S LIKE CAVE DIVING. Narrator: DESPITE THE DANGER, FATHER KNOWS BEST. I'D LIKE TO KEEP A MINIMUM OF 10 OUNCES A WEEK. YOU KNOW, AND IF I CAN KEEP THE KIDS WORKING, 10 OUNCES A WEEK, THAT'S NOTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? Narrator: WHILE THE KELLY BOYS RELY ON THE LUCK OF THE IRISH, OVER AT THE SHAMROCK... HOW'S THE GROUND LOOKING DOWN THERE? IS IT PRETTY BEAT UP? OH, HECK. YEAH, I AIN'T SEEING [BLEEP] IN THIS SPOT. ...FOR SHAWN POMRENKE, THE FIRST SPOT ISN'T LIVING UP TO MR. GOLD STANDARD. IT'S NOT WORTH DREDGING [BLEEP] IN THE WINTER, I'M LOOKING FOR, YOU KNOW, 3, 4 OUNCE AN HOUR MATERIAL, WHICH IS STARTING TO GET MORE RARE AND MORE RARE OUT THERE. SO, YEAH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE MOVES AND A LOT MORE SEARCHING TO FIND IT. THE MOVING IS A PAIN IN THE ASS, BUT IF YOU DON'T MOVE, YOU AIN'T GONNA FIND THE GOLD. NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. MR. GOLD CAN'T FIND NO GOLD! Narrator: OVER AT THE WILD RANGER... Vernon: HE'S COMING UP. ...VERNON'S CREW HAS BEEN MINING AROUND THE CLOCK FOR TWO FULL DAYS. Vernon: JASON WAS WORKING HERE LAST SUMMER. WE KNOW JASON WAS GETTING GOOD GOLD LAST YEAR. I'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY INVESTED IN EQUIPMENT. THE DIVERS, THEY GOT THEIR TIME AND ENERGY INVESTED. EVERYBODY'S JUST GOT HIGH HOPES THAT WE'LL DROP RIGHT DOWN ON TOP OF THE MOTHER LODE. BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU NEVER CAN TELL. THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION AND SUSPENSE IN THE AIR. WE'RE GONNA CHECK THE TEST MATS AND SEE WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL HE WAS IN. Narrator: NOW, TO SEE IF JASON HAS LED THEM TO THE PROMISED LAND, THEY'RE PANNING OUT THE FIRST FEW FEET OF THE SLUICE BOX. Jason: I LIKE IT. [ CHUCKLES ] WHOO. I'M ON SOME GOLD. THAT'S A DAMN GOOD TEST MAT. NOT REALLY SURPRISED. I'M JUST CONFIRMING WHAT I ALREADY KNEW. AFTER ALL THE SEASONS IN THE PAST, WHEN I'VE COME UP HERE AND JUST BOMBED OUT, SO MANY FALSE STARTS, I'LL TELL YOU, YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW GOOD IT FEELS TO FINALLY GET ON SOME GOOD, SOLID GOLD. Jason: THAT LOOKS GOOD. LOOK AT THAT CHUNKY [BLEEP] LOT OF CHUNKY. [ LAUGHING ] YOU GONNA GO GET SOME MORE? YEAH, I'M GONNA GO GET SOME MORE, BUT I'M GONNA SMOKE A CIGARETTE FIRST. GOOD IDEA. THAT FEELS GREAT! THAT FEELS GREAT. FEELS GREAT. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD PILE OF GOLD RIGHT THERE. DEFINITELY A BEAUTIFUL THING. HERE WE ARE AND ON THE SPOT THAT I FOUND. I MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THAT. I EARNED THE RIGHT TO BE IN CHARGE. I PAID MY DUES. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THREE SEASONS. I DON'T NEED 10 YEARS' EXPERIENCE. I LEARNED IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WHAT I NEED TO DO AND HOW TO DO THIS. [BLEEP] IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON AND DO MOON MINING. [ LAUGHS ] WE'RE NOT MINING HELIUM-3. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. ♪ GOLD MINING IS SOMETHING YOU DO NOT EVERYDAY ♪ Narrator: AFTER GOING ALL-IN AS A CAPTAIN... I'M THE KING OF THE ICEBERGS! HIT ONE FOR ME. I DARE YOU. Narrator: ...STEVE RIEDEL... GET OFF THE DREDGE. ...IS NOW A MAN WITHOUT A DREDGE. I NEED ABOUT $5,000 TO GET THE MINNOW BACK, AND I THINK I CAN DO THAT BY THE END OF ICE. Narrator: NOW, INSTEAD OF PANNING FOR GOLD, HE'S PANNING FOR SPARE CHANGE. SING ME A SONG, STEVE! Steve R.: THANKS, MR. $6.00. $6.60 TOWARDS THE MINNOW. THAT'LL BUY MAYBE BREAKFAST TOMORROW. Narrator: AFTER THREE DAYS ON THE FROZEN BERING SEA... ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. IT'S GOLD MINING. Narrator: ...THE FIRST RESULTS ARE COMING IN. IT'S DEFINITELY A LOT HARDER IN THE WINTER. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] WE AIN'T ON AS MUCH GOLD AS I'D LIKE TO BE, BUT WE'LL JUST KEEP FOLLOWING, AND HOPEFULLY IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING BIG. Narrator: FOR SHAWN POMRENKE AND THE SHAMROCK, THE FIRST DIVE HOLE IS A BUST. INDICATIONS ARE, WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD GOLD. Narrator: BUT OVER ON THE WILD RANGER, THINGS ARE LOOKING MUCH MORE PROMISING. THIS ICE SEASON, IT COST ME A BUNCH OF MONEY. I'M -- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO DO THE MATH. BUT I THINK WITH THIS CLEANUP THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW... OH, YEAH. ...I THINK I'M GONNA TURN A PROFIT. LET'S STOP IT AND TAKE A LOOK, JUST AS A MORALE BOOSTER. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. WHOO! WOW. TOO MUCH GOLD. GOLD DRIPPING OFF ON THE FLOOR. I'M DAMN PROUD OF MYSELF. I'M DAMN PROUD OF MYSELF. Narrator: WHILE VERNON WAITS TO SEE JUST HOW BIG HIS PAYDAY WILL BE, AT THE MISS NOMER... Glen: [ CHUCKLES ] THERE WE GO. ...AFTER LEARNING THE VALUE OF AN ICE-SHACK RELIEF HOLE, GLEN AND ZEKE ARE ABOUT TO LEARN THE VALUE OF THEIR GOLD. AND WE GOT 14.95 OUNCES. THIS IS GOOD. WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START HERE. Narrator: 14.95 OUNCES IS WORTH $19,500. IT COULD GET BETTER. IT'LL PROBABLY GET WORSE. NO, IT'S GONNA GET WAY BETTER. [ CHUCKLES ] WAY BETTER. Zeke: YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HAVE TAUGHT ME THAT THIS ACTUALLY IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY GLEN DOESN'T REALIZE THAT I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAY THAT. Narrator: AS GLEN AND ZEKE GET BACK TO WORK... Emily: AND I'M GOING WITH WHERE WE WERE DREDGING LAST. THERE WAS SOME GOOD GOLD. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE GLEN'S BEEN DREDGING RIGHT ABOUT WHERE WE WANT TO BE. Narrator: ...EMILY RIEDEL IS LOOKING TO MOVE IN ON THEIR TURF. THIS SPOT'S GONNA WORK GREAT. IT'S FLAT. THERE ARE NO PRESSURE RIDGES. MY GOAL THIS SEASON IS, I'M TIRED OF 50 OUNCES.
