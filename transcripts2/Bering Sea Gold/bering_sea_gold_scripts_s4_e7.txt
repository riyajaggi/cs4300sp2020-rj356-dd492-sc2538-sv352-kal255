 JUST A BIG, LONG LEARNING CURVE, YEAH. IT'S A HURTFUL LEARNING CURVE FOR A LOT OF THESE NEW GUYS. Narrator: EVERY SUMMER, THE LONG GRIND OF THE DREDGING SEASON SEPARATES WINNERS FROM LOSERS. $10,000 IN 5 [BLEEP] MONTHS? YOU'RE A WHINER. LET'S JUST GO TO WORK. Narrator: FOR THE WINNERS... CHRISTINE ROSE DEPARTING HARBOR. Narrator:...THE SPRINT TO THE FINISH IS ON. WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH GOLD AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, EVER. WE'RE JUST STACKING THE GOLD UP. Narrator: BUT FOR THREE DREDGES... EVERYTHING'S GOOD TO GO. WE'RE READY TO GO OUT AND MINE. ...AND TWO FAMILIES, THIS TRIP TO SEA... GO FIND ME SOME GOLD. ...WILL BE THE ONE THAT BREAKS THEM APART. Vernon: I'M HERE FOR SERIOUS FRIGGIN' BUSINESS. EITHER GET THE GOLD OR GET GONE. Narrator: ON BELMONT BEACH... LET'S GO. OKAY, WE'RE GOING. YEAH. Narrator:...FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SUMMER, BRAD KELLY AND HIS TWO SONS ARE ALL GOING DREDGING TOGETHER. Brad: I'D LIKE TO GET AT LEAST ONE TO TWO OUNCES, AT LEAST, TODAY. ALL THIS PISSING AROUND. MY DAD DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] HE'S DOING, AND IT'S APPARENT THE WAY EVERYTHING'S GOING. AND I'M TRYING TO WORK WITH SO MANY CONDITIONS THAT ARE WRONG. IT'S JUST -- HE MAKES EVERYTHING MISERABLE. MISERABLE AS [BLEEP] Narrator: IF YOU'RE NOT CAUGHT UP, HERE'S THE SHORT VERSION OF THE KELLY FAMILY CIRCUS. I HOPE YOU AND MY BROTHER LIVE GREAT. YEAH, ANY TIME. BRAD'S YOUNGEST SON, ANDY, QUIT... [ LAUGHS ] Narrator:...BRAD DROVE HIS OLDER SON KRIS NUTS... Andy: I JUST HATE THIS TOWN. Narrator:...ANDY CAME BACK... DAMN, SHE'S SO SMALL. SHE'D FIT UP A SUCTION HOSE. Narrator:...BRAD HAD A BABY... GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE. WON'T BE BACK FOR A LONG TIME. Narrator:...AND KRIS GOT KICKED OUT OF THE HOUSE. EVERYBODY GOT THAT? OKAY. GET ON BOARD. I'M GONNA GET THE ANCHORS AND GET GOING HERE. WITH MORE THAN HALF THE SEASON IN THE BOOKS AND A MISERABLE 10 OUNCES OF GOLD TO SHOW FOR IT... IT'S A PARTY A LOT OF THE TIME OUT HERE. OKAY, LET'S GET GOING. Narrator:...FOR THE FIGHTING IRISH, IT'S NOW OR NEVER. USUALLY, WORKING WITH MY FAMILY IS PRETTY GOOD. JUST RIGHT NOW, WITH MY DAD STARTING A NEW FAMILY, WE'RE NOT A FAMILY ANYMORE. BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS KIND OF OUT FOR THEMSELVES RIGHT NOW, SO THEY'RE WILLING TO SABOTAGE EACH OTHER TO GET AHEAD, OR THEY THINK THEY'RE GETTING AHEAD. ALL WE'RE DOING IS CUTTING EACH OTHER DOWN. AND NOW EVERYBODY IS AHEAD OF US. Kris: OH, I JUST REALLY WANT YOU TO BE IN A GOOD MOOD, AND US WORK GOOD TOGETHER HERE. HEY, I'M PEACHY. DON'T I LOOK IT? Brad: WE'RE HEADING OUT TO THE WEST REC AREA 'CAUSE I'VE GOT TO TURN THIS INTO A LIVING. THE WAY WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW, WE'RE WORKING IT LIKE RECREATIONAL DREDGERS. IT'S JUST -- IT'S A JOKE. I'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE FIRMER GOING AROUND RIGHT NOW. I JUST DO. I'M SO STRESSED OUT IN THE MIND FROM THESE BASTARDS. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I FEEL LIKE JUST THROWING THEM OVERBOARD AND DRIVING HOME. THAT'S NOT A GOOD WORKING SITUATION. EVERY TIME I GO HOME AND LOOK AT THIS LITTLE BABY'S FACE, IT DICTATES WHAT I HAVE TO DO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND WHO HAS TO BE WALKED ON. SOME PEOPLE GOT TO BE WALKED ON, YOU KNOW. TELL DAD I NEED TO GO 100 FEET UP AND 50 TO THE RIGHT. 100 FEET UP, 50 TO THE RIGHT. [ ENGINE REVS ] RIGHT HERE? I NEED TO GO UP THAT WAY MORE. OKAY. OKAY! IT'S FINE. THROW THE ANCHOR. FINE. WE'RE GONNA DRIFT RIGHT BACK [BLEEP] INTO THEM [BLEEP] Narrator: DESPITE KRIS' OBJECTIONS, IT'S CAPTAIN BRAD CALLING THE SHOTS ON JUST WHERE HIS SONS WILL DREDGE. IF MY DAD'S BOAT, THE REAPER, WAS MINE, I WOULD HAVE GOT OVER 100 OUNCES THIS SEASON, FOR SURE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE NEXT TO THE HARBOR, YOU KNOW, SO HE CAN ALMOST SWIM BACK IF THERE'S A PROBLEM. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER, REVS ] THERE YOU GO. IT'S GOT TO SING. HANG ON. LET'S GO. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GO LOOP AROUND THE BOAT AND WORK THE OTHER SIDE 'CAUSE THIS IS ALL CLAY. SOMEONE'S TAILING PILE. SOME STARFISH. THERE'S NOT GOLD EVERYWHERE, SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO PROSPECT. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE IN A GOOD SPOT RIGHT NOW. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT ON THE TOP OF THE BOAT? WE CAN SEE YOU THROUGH THE WATER. WE SEE YOU -- WAVE TO US. CAN YOU SEE THE GOLD, YOU [BLEEP] JUST BE QUIET, PLEASE. Narrator: WHILE KRIS GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS... ONE MILE TO THE EAST, IN THE SMALL-BOAT HARBOR... Daryl: ANOTHER DAY ON THE BERING SEA. PERFECT DREDGING WEATHER. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN GET ON A REALLY GOOD SPOT AGAIN AND GET SOME GOLD. Narrator: LATE IN THE MINING SEASON, CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL IS IN NEED OF A COMEBACK. Emily: MY GOAL IS 200 TO 400 OUNCES FOR THIS YEAR. WE'RE AT ABOUT 35 OUNCES. SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG IN MY OPERATION, AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT IS BECOMING TOO MUCH. Narrator: THE DISAPPOINTMENT HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR MORE THAN JUST EMILY. FOUR DAYS AGO... Emily: SO, I'VE HEARD YOU'RE QUITTING? YEAH, I GUESS SO. LEAVING TOMORROW. FED UP WITH THE LACK OF GOLD, EMILY'S GREENHORN "TONS" RUPPE PACKED UP AND SKIPPED TOWN. AND YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT, DON'T YOU? HAVE FUN IN LIFE FEELING GOOD ABOUT IT. TODAY... Mann: [ Slurring ] TOO MUCH TO DRINK. Narrator: ...AFTER DROWNING HIS SORROWS, DIVER TONY MANN IS A NO-SHOW. [ GROANS ] Narrator: DOWN WITH A CASE OF THE BROWN-BOTTLE FLU. [ VOMITING ] YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST CONSUMING ALCOHOL. I ENJOY DOING IT FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT, YOU KNOW, RUNNING AROUND, ABUSING ALCOHOL, NOT SHOWING UP FOR WORK, NOT PUTTING YOUR BEST EFFORT FORWARD. I MEAN, I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS, THIS YEAR, YOU KNOW? WE'RE HERE TO MAKE MONEY, AND ANYTHING LESS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Narrator: WITH HER 400-OUNCE GOAL SLIPPING AWAY, A MISSED DIVE SHIFT IS A MAJOR SETBACK. EMILY NEEDS TO RECOVER A BARE MINIMUM OF 150 OUNCES THIS SUMMER JUST TO KEEP HER DREDGE OUT OF THE RED. I FORGET THAT THINGS LIKE SLEEP AND BEER ARE REQUIRED TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE. [ CHUCKLES ] I AGREE. [ LAUGHS ] I KNOW YOU DO. I LIKE TO THINK OF MY TEAM AS MY FAMILY IN A LOT OF WAYS. WE ALL LIVE TOGETHER, AND WE ALL WORK TOGETHER, AND I CARE A LOT ABOUT MY TEAM, AND I CARE A LOT ABOUT TONY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE A [BLEEP] BUSINESS TO RUN... ...AND IF IT'S NOT PROFITABLE, THEN I LOSE A LOT OF MONEY. Emily: HEY, DARYL, HOW'S THE VIS UP TOP? COPY. Daryl: BUT WE'LL SEE WHEN I GET TO THE BOTTOM. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. COPY THAT. OH, YEAH. THIS LOOKS LIKE REALLY GOOD GROUND. ALL RIGHT. NICE. WHAT DO YOU SEE? COVERED IN VEGETATION -- LIKE IT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED AT ALL. FAIR ENOUGH. IS IT ROCKY OR SANDY? ROCKY. WE GOT COBBLE AND VEGETATION ALL OVER THE PLACE. DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD TO ME. NOPE, I THINK IT'S GONNA BE GOOD. OUR LAST CLEANUP WASN'T AS AWESOME AS WE HOPED IT WOULD BE, AND WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE CAN HIT 100 OUNCES, MUCH LESS 400 OUNCES, SO I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL STEP UP, START PUTTING IN LONG HOURS. HEY, DARYL, I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'RE DOING ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS SHOW UP ON TIME, AND YOU ALWAYS WORK NO MATTER WHAT -- HANGOVER OR LIFE CRISIS. THANK YOU. YOU'RE MY LAST RELIABLE MAN STANDING, DARYL. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GLAD I'M BACK IN THE WATER 'CAUSE NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO GET DOWN HERE AND GET THIS GOLD SUCKED UP. ALL RIGHT! THERE'S SOME COLOR. ALL RIGHT, I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. TODAY'S LOOKING UP. NICE. NICE. GOOD. 'CAUSE DARYL, TO ME, IS, LIKE, MY BEST MAN RIGHT NOW. HE CAN FUNCTION WITH OR WITHOUT ALCOHOL. Narrator: WITH HER ONLY SOBER DIVER ON THE GOLD, IT'S NOW A MATTER OF HOW TO HANDLE THE DRUNK ONE. Emily: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I COULD SAY, "STOP DRINKING OR YOU'RE FIRED." TONY WOULD PROBABLY JUST, YOU KNOW, KEEP DRINKING AND QUIT, AND THEN, I WOULD'VE ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING. WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH. Narrator: WHILE TONY'S IN THE DOG HOUSE, SEVEN MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... WE'RE JUST COMING OUT TO OUR SPOT. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A POT OF GOLD. HOPEFULLY, THE GODS ARE ON OUR SIDE. WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. Narrator: ...SHAWN POMRENKE... WHERE'S THE GOLD AT, TEDDY? OVER THERE? Narrator:...ALONG WITH HIS NEW GREENHORN ARE FULL STEAM AHEAD FOR THE DIGGING GROUNDS. SO FAR, HE'S BEEN REALLY GOOD LUCK. Narrator: THIS SEASON... BOOM. THERE WE GO. ...EVERY TRIP TO THE CLAIM HAS COME UP BIG... YEAH. WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOME MONEY. THAT'S GONNA MAKE THAT BOX LIGHT RIGHT UP. ...PUTTING SHAWN AND THE CHRISTINE ROSE ON TRACK FOR THEIR FIRST-EVER 1,000-OUNCE SUMMER. Shawn: THIS IS WHY THEY CALL ME MR. GOLD, RIGHT HERE. Narrator: WITH 650 OUNCES WORTH 780 GRAND ALREADY IN THE BANK... THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. WE STARTED KILLING IT. BIG CLEANUP AFTER BIG CLEANUP AFTER BIG CLEANUP. WE'RE JUST GETTING BACK TO WHERE WE WERE DIGGING. THERE'S A LITTLE DREDGE IN THE WAY, BUT WE'RE GONNA JUST MOVE ON OVER HERE AND GET BACK ON TO THIS GOOD GOLD WE WERE ON. Narrator: ...THE SKIPPER'S HELL-BENT ON HITTING THAT MARK... Shawn: I'M COMING RIGHT FOR YOU, BUDDY. Narrator:...NO MATTER WHOSE LINES MAY GET CROSSED. HE'S TRYING TO BUOY OFF AREAS AND CLAIM AREAS, AND IT JUST AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. Narrator: ON THE INCREASINGLY CROWDED CLAIM, ONE DREDGER HAS STARTED STRETCHING ROPE LINES TO MARK OFF TURF. Shawn: IT'S NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS BEFORE. I MEAN, I'VE BEEN ON THE TOMCOD FOR 15 YEARS AND NEVER SEEN THIS MANY DREDGES. GOLD'S GONNA GET MINED UP. IT'S GONNA DISAPPEAR. Shawn: YOU GUYS GOT JUST LINES RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. WE HAVE TWO LINES OUT. I'M SORRY, BUT THESE LINES ACROSS THE WATER ARE A HAZARD TO NAVIGATION. IT'S IN THE DAMN PERMITS, IF YOU READ. YOU CANNOT CAUSE HAZARDS. Narrator: IN MODERN-DAY NOME, STAKING A CLAIM -- AND JUMPING ONE -- IS ALL ABOUT THE BUOYS. YOU CAN'T HAVE THESE LINES IN-BETWEEN AND THE BUOYS ALL AROUND. SOME BOAT WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS IS GONNA COME ACROSS HERE, HOOK YOUR [BLEEP] LINE, AND [BLEEP] FLIP OUT OF THE BOAT, AND YOU'RE GONNA KILL SOMEBODY. NO, THEY'RE NOT. DON'T [BLEEP] GIVE ME THE SAME-THING BULL[BLEEP]. YOU'RE WAY TOO SPREAD OUT. YOU GUYS CAN'T MOVE THIS [BLEEP] WHOLE SPOT IN HERE. GET OUT DEEPER. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF GOLD OUT THERE. [BLEEP] YOU CAN'T CLAIM OFF THIS WHOLE AREA. WE DIDN'T. YOU'RE TRYING. NO! I'M GONNA START MOVING BUOYS. DON'T MOVE THE BUOYS. I'M MOVING THE BUOYS. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... Shawn: YOU CAN'T CLAIM OFF THIS WHOLE AREA. Man: WE DIDN'T. YOU'RE TRYING. NO! I'M GONNA START MOVING BUOYS. DON'T MOVE THE BUOYS. I'M MOVING THE BUOYS. Narrator: ANOTHER MINING CREW IS ATTEMPTING TO BOX-OUT SHAWN POMRENKE FROM HIS FAVORITE HONEY HOLE. COME JUMP ON MY SPOT AND THEN FIGURE I'M JUST GONNA -- COME [BLEEP] THROW BUOYS OUT? YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT THE [BLEEP] WELL, WHEN THEY'RE IN MY WAY, I'M GONNA MOVE THEM. WHEN PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE, YOU DON'T SCREW AROUND. A BOAT COMES THROUGH, SNAGS, HE'S GOT SUCH HEAVY ANCHORS ON THE BOTTOM THAT IT'D JUST RIP THE MOTOR OFF THE BOAT AND COULD KILL SOMEBODY. I AIN'T GONNA FILL [BLEEP] AROUND. THIS IS WHAT IT IS... THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. WE ARE GONNA MINE HERE. Narrator: BRUSHING PAST THE BUOYS, SHAWN SETS UP THE BARGE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OTHER CREW'S ROPE LINE. [ WHISTLES ] Shawn: IT AIN'T YOUR GOLD UNTIL IT'S IN YOUR BOX, SO I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT THOSE SMALL GUYS. THEY CAN COME AROUND AND TRY TO GET IN THE WAY, BUT THE MATTER OF THE FACT IS I'LL JUST MINE RIGHT AROUND THEM. BUNCH OF LITTLE FLIES THAT YOU JUST KEEP WHACKING AWAY. [ LAUGHS ] I WANT TO TAKE A FEW TEST PANS, SEE WHAT'S HERE. OH, THAT STUFF LOOKS PRETTY TASTY. IT'S THE MATERIAL AND THE WAY IT'S IN THE BUCKET. IT DON'T LOOK LIKE IT'S BEEN DREDGED. OH, NICE. YEAH! GO AHEAD. LET'S FIRE UP AND RUN. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] HOPEFULLY, WE CAN TURN THIS BOX YELLOW. WE'RE GONNA RUN SOME DIRT AND MAKE SOME GOLD. I'M GONNA MAKE EVERYBODY'S DREAMS COME TRUE. FIRST BUCKET. BOOM! I LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS. IT'S NICE GRAVEL, EASY DIGGING. CHEWING IT UP. Narrator: JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY... ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOMCOD... GRINDING AWAY, PLUGGING AWAY, EVERY DAMN DAY, EVERY MINUTE WE CAN ON THIS OPERATION. THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. YOU JUST GOT TO GET IN HERE, AND YOU GOT TO BE RELENTLESS. Narrator: OWNER VERNON ADKISON, ALONG WITH HIS DAUGHTER ELAINE AND HER BOYFRIEND, DIVER SHEM FOGELMAN, HAVE THE WILD RANGER UP AND RUNNING. Vernon: HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING DOWN THERE? Shem: WHOO! ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. Narrator: SO FAR THIS SEASON, VERNON HAS COLLECTED A SOLID 94 OUNCES WORTH $113,000. THE WILD RANGER HAS GOTTEN MORE IMPACT AROUND NOME IN THE MINING COMMUNITY. I CAN'T SAY THAT WE'VE STRUCK IT RICH YET, BUT PEOPLE KNOW WE'RE PRODUCING. THERE'S GOLD TO BE GOTTEN OUT THERE, AND YOU CAN GET IT IF YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH AND YOU PERSEVERE. Narrator: THE GOLD'S NOT THE ONLY THING ON THE SKIPPER'S AGENDA. YEP. HE'S ALSO LOOKING TO MOVE HIS DAUGHTER UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. Vernon: HAVING ELAINE UP HERE, I'M GETTING TO KNOW HER BETTER. I CAN SEE ELAINE EVENTUALLY COMING INTO THE MANAGEMENT SIDE. ALL RIGHT. HEADED UP. ALL RIGHT. I'M LEADING UP THE LADDER. Elaine: I'D LIKE TO HAVE A MANAGERIAL POSITION. I REALLY HOPE THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, AND I THINK I'LL DEFINITELY GET IN HIS GOOD GRACES IF I CAN JUST... COMMUNICATE WITH HIM. Narrator: THE ONLY THING STANDING IN THE WAY OF ADKISON FAMILY UNITY... THIS TEST-MAT THING JUST GETS MORE AND MORE RIDICULOUS EVERY TIME I GET ON THE BOAT. Narrator: VERNON'S POLICY OF SWITCHING OUT THE FIRST FEW FEET OF SLUICE-BOX CARPET AFTER EVERY DIVE. I WISH DAD WOULD JUST LEAVE [BLEEP] ALONE, MAN. I'M HAVING THE DIVERS SAVE THEIR TEST-MAT MATERIAL, AND AT THE END OF OUR CLEANUP, I'LL KNOW IF SOMEBODY'S NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH. DAMN IT. [BLEEP] [BLEEP] Elaine: HE INSISTS ON CHANGING THEM. [ SIGHS ] IT JUST ENRAGES ME. SO, ELAINE, WHY IS IT THAT YOU TOOK THOSE CLIPS OUT THAT I HAD PUT IN THERE? BECAUSE THEY WERE -- IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT THIS THING IN WITH THEM LIKE THAT. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE WAY YOU GUYS DO IT, I FIND IT DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THOSE FRIGGIN' MATS OUT. WELL THEN, YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING TO DO IT, ANYWAY. DON'T GIVE ME ANY DAMN LIP ABOUT IT. I'M JUST TRYING TO TALK TO YOU HERE. YOU'RE RAISING YOUR VOICE AT ME. I'M TELLING YOU, THE OTHER WAY IS EASIER. NOT FOR ME AND NOT FOR ANYBODY ELSE. BUT IT'S MORE DIFFICULT THE WAY YOU HAD IT. NO, IT'S NOT. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS. Shem: YEP. [ SIGHS ] IF I TELL YOU TO LEAVE IT ALONE, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE, [BLEEP] LEAVE IT ALONE. YOU KNOW, QUIT TINKERING WITH [BLEEP] LIKE AN OLD... EVERYTHING HAS TO TURN INTO A POWER STRUGGLE WITH ELAINE, AND SHE'S BOUND AND DETERMINED SHE'S GONNA WIN. WELL, I'M BOUND AND DETERMINED SHE'S NOT. I'M NOT GONNA GET ANY COOPERATION OUT OF YOU. THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE. WELL, NO, I'M NOT GONNA -- NO, UNH-UNH. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. GOT BETTER [BLEEP] TO DO THAN [BLEEP] WITH THESE STUPID TEST MATS. [ SIGHS ] I DON'T HAPPEN TO THINK THEY'RE STUPID TEST MATS. IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING GOOD GOLD, THERE'S NO SENSE IN BEING THERE. I UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF THE [BLEEP] TEST MATS! WILL YOU WATCH YOUR DAMN MOUTH?! NO. LITTLE [BLEEP]HEAD. I'M SICK OF IT. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN STAND TO BE AROUND YOU. GOD. [BLEEP] ARGUE. NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF MY OPINION DOESN'T [BLEEP] MATTER, WHATEVER. I'M ON HERE. I SEE WHAT GOES ON. I UNDERSTAND THE DAMN TEST MATS. I KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE. I [BLEEP] SPEND MORE TIME OUT HERE -- WILL YOU WATCH YOUR DAMN MOUTH?! NO! THEN JUST SHUT UP, THEN! FINE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU, YOU FOUL-MOUTHED LITTLE -- LITTLE WHAT? SO YOU CAN [BLEEP] SCREAM IN MY FACE, AND I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING TO YOU? LISTEN! DON'T -- NO! GET YOUR [BLEEP] ASS OFF THIS BOAT. GET OFF THE FREAKIN' BOAT. I'M SICK OF YOUR [BLEEP] ANY TIME HE STARTS WITH ME, I HAD TO JUST -- IT ALL GETS UNLEASHED, AND I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF. IT'S MY DAMN BOAT, AND I WANT IT DONE MY WAY. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Shawn: WE'LL LET THEM GET A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD OUT OF THERE, AND THEN I'M GONNA GO DIG THAT WHOLE AREA UP, WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT. Narrator: ...FORCED TO SHARE THE SPOT WITH MORE AND MORE DREDGES... I'LL BE DAMNED IF THEY'RE GONNA COME HERE AND TRY TO TAKE MY GOLD. Narrator: ...SHAWN POMRENKE IS MAKING THE MOST OF THE GROUNDS HE'S ON... Shawn: JUST FINISHED TWO CUTS. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CHECK THE SLUICE BOX. HOPEFULLY, WE SEE A BUNCH OF YELLOW! AFTER I GRAB MY SWEATER. Narrator: ...ON A MISSION TO COLLECT 1,000 OUNCES FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. THE ONLY WAY TO CHECK PROGRESS IS TO CHECK THE BOX. OH. Shawn: LOOK AT THIS PIECE. PROBABLY ONE OF THE COOLEST PIECES OF GOLD I'VE SEEN YET. WE'VE BEEN AT IT ENOUGH YEARS THAT WE GOT THE MACHINE FINE-TUNED TO WHERE IT JUST RUNS LIKE A FINE-OILED MACHINE. YOU SEE THAT PIECE? NICE NUGGET. WE'VE BEEN ON THE GOLD ALL SEASON. WE'RE GONNA HIT 1,000 THIS YEAR. I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. THICKER. LET'S GO AHEAD AND FIRE UP. AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP PILING IT IN THERE. I'M GONNA BE SITTING PRETTY. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN IS LEADING HIS CREW TO ANOTHER BIG PAYDAY, BACK IN NOME... I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH MY CREW. OH? THE DRINKING IS GETTING PRETTY SERIOUS. OH, YEAH. RIGHT. YEAH. EMILY RIEDEL IS LOOKING FOR ADVICE ON LEADERSHIP, SO SHE'S GONE TO THE MOST LOGICAL SOURCE -- TWO-TIME FAILED CAPTAIN, HER DAD, STEVE. I CAME UP HERE WITH EMILY. I WANT TO KEEP IN CONTACT WITH HER. SHE TELLS ME HER TROUBLES, AND I LISTEN. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HER. YOU GOT TO TAKE EMILY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE EMILY IS A SERIOUS WOMAN, AND SHE'S A BADASS. AND WHEN TONY GETS IN THE WATER AND DOES A DIVE, HE'S VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE WATER. SURE, EVEN HUNGOVER. EVEN HUNGOVER. I'M STARTING TO RELY ON DARYL TOO MUCH, AND HE PICKS UP TOO MUCH OF THE WEIGHT NOW. FOR ALL OF MY DAD'S SCATTER-BRAINED, KIND OF, LIKE, MANIACAL APPROACH TO LIFE, [CHUCKLES] HE DOES OFFER ME THE BEST ADVICE. WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT SOME BOUNDARIES ON HIM. IF YOU GO, "IF YOU'RE NOT HOME BY MIDNIGHT, THE DOOR GETS LOCKED, YOU SLEEP SOMEWHERE ELSE." HEY, YOU'RE THE BOSS. WELL, I FEEL LIKE THOSE GUYS ONLY SOMEWHAT RESPECT ME. YEAH, WELL, OKAY. IN THAT SENSE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE NIGHTMARES FROM MY LAST CREW. THEY WALKED AWAY FROM ME WITHOUT A WORD. Narrator: LAST SUMMER... HIPPITY, HIPPITY, HIPPITY -- AND THAT'S ALL, FOLKS. ...EMILY'S FIRST DIVE CREW QUIT MID-SEASON. IF THIS IS A TEST OF A FIRST-TIME CAPTAIN, I THINK I'M FAILING. Narrator: FEARING ANOTHER EXODUS, THE SKIPPER'S GUN-SHY ABOUT LAYING DOWN THE LAW. WITH THIS CREW, YOU KNOW, THEY RESPECT ME MORE, CERTAINLY, BUT THEY DON'T REALLY RESPECT MY NEED FOR THEM TO [BLEEP] BE ON TOP OF THEIR [BLEEP]. WELL, THE BOUNDARIES NEED TO HAPPEN, THEN BECAUSE IT'S THEIR BEHAVIOR THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE, NOT YOURS. YOU'RE DOING FINE. IT'S LIKE I'VE BEEN TOO EASY ON THEM, AND IF I CRACK DOWN ALL OF THE SUDDEN, THEN I COULD INSTIGATE A MUTINY. [ SIGHS ] WELL, IT'S YOUR BOAT, YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. YOU'VE GOT TO STEER IT. YOU GOT TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN, AND SOMETIMES IT'S UNPLEASANT THINGS YOU GOT TO MAKE HAPPEN, BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON TO DO THAT. A LITTLE FATHERLY ADVICE IS ALWAYS HELPFUL... Brad: HOW DOES IT LOOK? ARE YOU SEEING ANY GOLD? ...UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOUR LAST NAME IS KELLY. Kris: NO, I'M NOT SEEING ANY GOLD AT ALL. OKAY, MOVE. MOVE AGAIN. AFTER A RECORD SIX HOURS ON THE BOTTOM, SEARCHING THE VERY SPOT BRAD INSISTED ON DREDGING... NOT EVEN ONE LITTLE FLAKE. ...IT'S LOOKING LIKE ANOTHER BUM DIVE FOR KRIS. SOMETIMES THERE'S GOOD GOLD, SOMETIMES THERE ISN'T. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD AND QUIT YOUR WHINING. HE'S HARD TO WORK WITH. OKAY. I GOT TO MOVE. EVERY TIME HE DETERMINES IT'S NOT ENOUGH GOLD TO WORK, WE END UP [BLEEP] NOT MOVING AND HAVE TO PROSPECT. THE MORE I MOVE AROUND, IT MAKES ONE HELL OF A CLOUD. IF TONY KEEPS GOING ANOTHER 40 FEET, HE'S GONNA GO PAST IT IN 20 FEET. I DON'T THINK I SHOULD. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? BECAUSE WE KNOW! DUDE, I'M LOOKING WHERE YOU ARE. YOU CAN NEVER [BLEEP] BE RIGHT WITH THIS [BLEEP] IT'S A NIGHTMARE WORKING WITH THAT BASTARD. THERE'S NO COBBLE ON THIS. OKAY. WELL, I'M MOVING. THAT SUCKS. NOW, HE'S TURNING AROUND AND GOING BACK AGAIN. GO BACK IN AND WAIT. TURN DOWN THE RADIO, PLEASE! THIS [BLEEP] BETTER GET GOLD. HE'S WASTING MY FUEL DOWN THERE. AND WHERE IS HE NOW? HE'S OVER THERE. HE'S BACK WHERE HE WAS. LOOK. GO TO THE RIGHT. IS HE STUPID? I TOLD HIM TO KEEP MOVING. HE DOESN'T LISTEN. COME ON, SAND. I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. THERE'S TOO MUCH SAND. THIS IS A FAILED BOAT. CABLE'S AROUND ON EVERYTHING. YOU'RE DOING LOTS OF WHINING. Kris: OKAY, LET'S HAVE REMEDIAL RADIO SILENCE FOR [BLEEP] 10 MINUTES. YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF. OKAY, RADIO SILENCE NOW. Narrator: ONE-1,000... TWO-1,000... THREE-1,000... AND... I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE PUT IN, BUDDY, BUT IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, WE'LL GIVE YOU $20 AN HOUR. SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP! SHUT UP! SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! I QUIT THIS BOAT RIGHT NOW! [BLEEP] YOU ALL! OH, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. DO I HAVE TO? YOU'RE DOING GOOD. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... Kris: I QUIT THIS BOAT RIGHT NOW! [BLEEP] YOU ALL! OH, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. Brad: DO I HAVE TO? AFTER MONTHS OF MISTREATMENT AND NO GOLD, KRIS KELLY HAS FINALLY HAD ENOUGH. IT'S YOU BRINGING US DOWN. IT'S YOU. YEAH? YEAH, IT'S YOU. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GO DO NOW? GO SIT ON THE COUCH AT HOME? Brad: MAN, IF YOU WANT TO FEEL NEGATIVE IN YOUR LIFE, JUST HANG AROUND WITH KRIS. HE'LL BRING A PRIEST DOWN IN THE CHURCH. HE'S A 32-YEAR-OLD MAN, OR HOWEVER OLD HE [BLEEP] IS, WITH A 16-YEAR-OLD MENTALITY. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE, YOU KNOW? WELL, IF YOU'RE DONE, THEN LET'S HER PACK HER UP THEN. Kris: LET'S PACK UP. LET'S GO. Narrator: THE FIRST TRIP TO SEA FOR ALL THREE KELLY BOYS IS ALSO THE LAST. Brad: KRIS WANTS A DIFFERENT LIFE. HE WANTS TO LIVE THE KELLY LIFE FROM TORONTO. I DON'T LIVE THAT LIFE. HE WAS RAISED IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF MY LIFE WHEN TIMES WERE A LOT BETTER. THINGS WERE A LOT DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW? I LIVED IN A PENTHOUSE. I HAD A DIFFERENT WAY OF LIFE, AND HE GREW UP IN THAT SENSE. Kris: I HAVE TO QUIT, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I'M NEVER GONNA MAKE A DOLLAR WITH MY DAD. AND I'M JUST GONNA KEEP PUTTING INTO A FAMILY OPERATION, WHICH I'M NOT PART OF THE FAMILY ANYMORE. I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THESE BAD CAPTAINS AND PEOPLE USING ME. YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. I'VE BEEN AT THIS [BLEEP] NOW A YEAR AND A HALF, AND I'M GETTING USED LIKE A TAMPON. IT'S [BLEEP] INSANE. Narrator: KRIS KELLY'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THROWING IN THE TOWEL. [ CELLPHONE RINGING ] YEAH, HEY, ELAINE. WHAT'S UP? Hey, Dad. Do you have a minute to talk? Yeah, I always got a second to talk to you. HEY, I'M JUST CALLING TO LET YOU KNOW I'M DONE. I'M NOT GONNA WORK FOR YOU ANYMORE. UH, SO, UH...JUST... THAT'S IT? NO EXPLANATION? JUST "HI," "BYE," AND "KISS MY ASS," and away you go, huh? THERE'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE HAVEN'T ALREADY TALKED ABOUT. WELL, DID YOU EVER THINK -- I'VE TOLD YOU TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, ELAINE. And it boils down to communication, AND YOU REFUSE TO COMMUNICATE. And until you communicate, you're gonna keep me ABOUT BORDERLINE PISSED OFF ALL THE TIME. YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T LIKE ME, RESENT ME FOR WHATEVER REASONS, And that has just caused you TO TREAT ME LIKE A PIECE OF [BLEEP] So, I'm not gonna deal with it anymore, so I'm done. SO BE IT. YOU JUST STAY THAT WAY. YOU DO WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO. DON'T CALL ME, ELAINE. JUST, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I'M DONE WITH YOU. GET ON OUT OF HERE. DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU IN THE ASS. I REALLY DON'T CARE IF DAD APPROVES OF WHAT I DO OR NOT [CHUCKLES] AT ALL. YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME FOR HER TO SPREAD HER WINGS AND FLY AWAY AND DON'T COME BACK KNOCKING ON MY DOOR. Narrator: ACROSS TOWN... [ DOG BARKING ] ...AT EMILY RIEDEL'S APARTMENT... Emily: TEAM MEETING. THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF WEIGHING HEAVILY ON ME. I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE YOU LIFE COACHING. I'M JUST TRYING TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A REALLY AWESOME SEASON. Narrator: ...TAKING HER DAD'S ADVICE... I GOT A NEW RULE COMING OUT. ON DREDGING DAYS, IT'S GONNA BE A CURFEW. DRINKING OR NO DRINKING. IN BY 11, DOORS ARE SEALED AT MIDNIGHT. Daryl: DAMN IT. DAMN IT. ...THE CAPTAIN IS LAYING DOWN A CURFEW ON HER DIVERS. LIKE AN ALL-GIRLS SCHOOL. LIKE AN -- [ LAUGHS ] WELL, IT IS AN ALL-GIRLS SCHOOL, DARYL. AH. [ LAUGHS ] [ CHUCKLES ] YES. WELL PLANNED ON MY PART. I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO REMAIN FOCUSED. THIS SEASON IS GETTING AWAY FROM US. WE CAN'T BE SLACKING. THAT GOES FOR ME AS WELL AS YOU GUYS. ALL RIGHT. COOL. WELL, WE'RE ALL IN ACCORD? AYE, AYE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THEN, THAT'S ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID, THEN. PROBLEMS ARE WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS BUSINESS, AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF MANAGING THEM AS BEST AS YOU CAN. I HAVE SO MANY BURNED RELATIONSHIPS WITH FORMER CREW MEMBERS AND PARTNERS FROM THE PAST, AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. I REALLY WANT A TEAM THAT I CAN DEPEND ON, THAT DEPENDS ON ME, AND THAT IS SOLID AND NOT GOING ANYWHERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE 11:00 DEAL? I GOT DAUGHTERS OLDER THAN EMILY, AND THEY DON'T TELL ME WHAT TIME I CAN GET HOME. DID SHE SAY 11:00 A.M. OR P.M.? IF I NEEDED A PARENTAL FIGURE, I'D HAVE BROUGHT ONE. YEAH, I DON'T KNOW ONE DIVER IN THE STATE OF ALASKA THAT WOULD WORK UNDER THOSE KIND OF RULES. PRETTY MUCH PRISON IS WHAT I CALL IT, AND SHE'S THE WARDEN. Steve R.: IT'S REALLY HOT IN MY YURT, AND EMILY'S COMING OVER, AND I HAVE HER BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR HER. HELLO. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! THANKS! YEAH. THERE'S NO ODDITY THAT MY DAD COULD COME UP WITH THAT WOULD SURPRISE ME AT THIS POINT. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, EMMY. OH, MY GOD! I GOT THIS .44 MAGNUM IN HERE. OH, MY GOD! DID YOU PUT THIS IN THERE BY ACCIDENT? NO, IT'S YOURS. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. IT'S A CHEST HOLSTER. UH-HUH. OH, MY GOD. DAD, THIS IS AMAZING. WOW, LOOK AT THOSE BULLETS. I LOVE IT. OKAY, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T POINT THAT AT ANYONE. OKAY, HERE WE GO. OKAY, BEAR! BEAR! OH, OKAY. YOU KIND OF -- YOU KIND OF POINTED IT AT ME. I'LL GET OVER HERE. [ LAUGHS ] THANKS, DAD. THANKS. THANKS. ALL RIGHT. HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN. Narrator: IN THE CENTER OF NOME... Kris: MY DAD, HE'S TAKING ME DOWN THIS SEASON, CONSTANTLY PUTTING ME IN A BAD MOOD. Narrator: ...FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS 34 YEARS, KRIS KELLY IS OUT FROM UNDER HIS FATHER'S THUMB. MY DAD DOESN'T WANT ME TO SUCCEED AT ALL. HE WANTS ME TO FAIL, BUT NOBODY WILL REALLY GIVE ME A JOB. MY OPTIONS ARE EXTREMELY SLIM. SO I'M GONNA GO, RIGHT NOW, FIX ALL MY LITTLE PROBLEMS. THROW SOME MONEY AND GOLD AT THIS GUY, AND HOPEFULLY HE ACCEPTS MY DEAL. HERE HE IS. RATHER THAN PACKING UP, KRIS IS HEADED TO BELMONT BEACH TO MEET WITH A FAILING FIRST- YEAR MINER, DAVE MAGLIOCCA, BETTER KNOWN AS "BOSTON" DAVE. HEY, DAVE. WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP, KRIS? HEY. I HEARD YOU'RE SELLING YOUR LITTLE BOAT. EHH... I'M IN THE MARKET, TOO. I'M NOT WORKING WITH MY DAD ANYMORE, SO I CAN... YEAH, I HEARD. I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOUR LITTLE BOAT OVER. UM, I'M ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW... I GOT A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT, DUDE. SHE WORKS GOOD, BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR A PARTNER. IT'S A TWO-MAN OPERATION. I JUST -- I REALLY NEED SOMEBODY THAT JUST GETS UP AND WORKS IN THE MORNING. YOU KNOW, 50/50 SPLIT. IF I HAD THE RIGHT GUY, YOU KNOW, AND THE RIGHT AGREEMENT. I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BOTH OF US. YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS YOU'RE GETTING GOLD, AND I'M GETTING GOLD, WE'LL DO WELL THIS SEASON. LET'S TALK SOME GOLD AND SOME MONEY. ALL RIGHT, SO 10 GRAND BUYS YOU HALF OF LOKO. CAN I MAKE PAYMENTS ON THAT? DONE DEAL. OKAY, I THINK IT MIGHT WORK, DUDE. ALL RIGHT, BRO. Narrator: NO MONEY DOWN, NO CREDIT CHECK REQUIRED. THIS "SIGN THEN DREDGE" EVENT MAKES KRIS KELLY THE PROUD CO-OWNER OF ONE RED RUBBER DINGY, THE LOKO. I'M GONNA MAKE THIS [BLEEP] BOAT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. WE'RE GONNA GET LIKE 75 OUNCES EASY. I HOPE SO, MAN. WELL, LET'S GO OUT FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING. I THINK -- FIRST THING. FIRST THING. I LIKE IT. YOU KNOW, YOU NEED TO BUILD A FOUNDATION. YOU KNOW, A SOLID FOUNDATION SO YOU CAN MOVE UP AND REALLY START A BUSINESS. AND SO IT'S ALL ON OUR SHOULDERS. FAIL OR MAKE IT, IT'S ALL ON US. ANOTHER GOOD INVESTMENT BY KRIS KELLY. Narrator: WHILE KRIS IS STARTING OVER FROM SCRATCH, OVER AT THE EROICA CREW APARTMENT... YOU LOCK DOWN WITH ALL KINDS OF REGULATIONS? THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP ANYBODY. NOT ME. ...GETTING HANDED DOWN A CURFEW FROM A 26-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ISN'T SITTING WELL WITH DARYL AND TONY. I DON'T DO WELL BEING TOLD WHAT I HAVE TO DO, AND WHAT I CAN'T. WE'RE DIVERS FOR HIRE, AND RIGHT NOW, THE MONEY IS NOT HERE. WE'RE MAKING $3 AN HOUR. I CAN GO WORK AT MCDONALD'S AND MAKE DOUBLE THAT. I CAN GO BACK TO MY REGULAR JOB AND MAKE [BLEEP] 10 TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS I'M MAKING THIS SEASON. EXACTLY. WITH JUST $10,000 PER MAN COLLECTED ON THE SEASON, EMILY'S FEAR OF CAUSING A REVOLT... Emily: HEY. SO... I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU. ...HAS BECOME A REALITY. WELL... WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I'M GOING WITH HIM. WAIT, YOU GUYS ARE BOTH LEAVING? I'M NOT GONNA WORK FOR FREE. OH. OH. OH. OH. OH. I'M SORRY. UM, ME GIVING YOU A JOB AND FUNDING YOU ALL SUMMER MAKE YOU GUYS FEEL CONFIDENT IN [BLEEP] ME OVER? YOU'RE NOT PAYING EVERYTHING. I'VE HAD HOUSING. BOATS THAT PRODUCE QUADRUPLE WHAT YOU PRODUCE. YOU'RE LEAVING AT THE END OF A [BLEEP] SEASON?! YOU'RE [BLEEP] WALKING AWAY FROM THE [BLEEP] BOAT AT THE [BLEEP] PIVOTAL POINT OF THE [BLEEP] SEASON?! THE WEATHER COULD BE PERFECT! REALLY? REALLY? YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE DOING THIS? REALLY? LIKE, AFTER EVERYTHING THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH, AND YOU SEEN ME GO THROUGH WITH PEOPLE [BLEEP] ME OVER? YOU'RE IN THERE, TOO? [ SNIFFLES, CHUCKLES ] YOU KNOW WHAT, [BLEEP] ALL OF YOU PEOPLE. [BLEEP] YOU, AND [BLEEP] YOU. [ SCOFFS ] [ Voice breaking ] [BLEEP] DAMN IT, I AM TRYING. [ SNIFFLES, SIGHS ] [ Normal voice ] I'M NOT CRYING. [ LAUGHS ] I DON'T CRY ANYMORE. Narrator: WITHIN JUST 72 HOURS, THE HARSH REALITY OF MINING IN NOME HAS BUSTED UP THREE TEAMS, BUT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, ONE TEAM... JUST ANOTHER WONDERFUL CLEANUP OFF THE CHRISTINE ROSE. ...IS STILL GOING FOR GLORY. Shawn: THERE'S SOME GOLD IN THERE. WITH 651 OUNCES TOWARD THEIR 1,000-OUNCE GOAL, SHAWN AND THE BOYS ARE LOOKING TO PUT ANOTHER MAJOR TALLY UP ON THE BOARD. WE NEED TO HIT OUR 1,000-OUNCE MARK.
