 Narrator: NOME, ALASKA. THE SHORTEST ICE MINING SEASON ON RECORD IS KICKING INTO HIGH GEAR. THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY, THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, IS SHUTTING US DOWN THE 15th OF APRIL. THAT SUCKS. WE HAVE HOT WATER. WE HAVE COLD ICE. WE NEED TO GET DOWN THERE AND START POPPING DIRT. Narrator: HOPING TO TURN A FAST PROFIT, MINERS ARE GAMBLING ON RADICAL NEW EQUIPMENT...

 BIG MONEY. BIG, BIG, BIG MONEY. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I'M A BIT NERVOUS. ...AND HAZARDING FAR-FLUNG HOT SPOTS. HEY! YOU GUYS AWAKE IN THERE? IT'S TIME TO GET UP. OH, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT TO. EVER SINCE I WAS A KID, WE WENT CAMPING AT THE BLUFF. I SPENT 20 YEARS OF THINKIN' OF HOW I'M GONNA GET DOWN THERE AND GO MININ' THERE. WE WANNA FIND THAT GOLD. WE WANNA FIND THAT MOTHER LODE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: A HUNDRED MILES FROM NOME CITY LIMITS... MAN, IT WAS COLD OUT LAST NIGHT. UM, IT'S BEEN A LONG, HARD FEW DAYS TO GET OUT HERE, BUT WE'RE HERE.

 IT'S DAY ONE OF MINING IN THE WILD FOR THE POMRENKE CREW. THOSE BOOTS ARE PROBABLY LIKE ICE CUBES. THEY ARE PRETTY DAMN COLD. THIS IS WHAT MR. GOLD HAS FOR BREAKFAST. AFTER PULLING OVER $5 MILLION FROM THE WATERS OF NOME, THIS WINTER... ...MR. GOLD IS ROLLING THE DICE, LOOKING FOR HIS NEXT BIG PAYDAY... AND THERE IT IS. THERE'S THE BLUFFS. Narrator: ...TRAVELING DEEP INTO THE BUSH TO GROUNDS UNTOUCHED FOR NEARLY A CENTURY. OH, WOW. THIS PLACE IS PRETTY ROUGH. Shawn: ALL RIGHT. THE OLD MINER'S CABIN GIVES A LITTLE MORE SHELTER, A PLACE TO COOK. WE COULD'VE STUCK AROUND TOWN, WENT AND JUST GRINDED OUT AND GOT SOME GOLD. BUT WITH THE SHORTER SEASON, I FEEL LIKE WE COULD TAKE A LOT MORE CHANCES. SO I GOTTA MELT ICE HERE JUST TO MAKE COFFEE. WE GOTTA GO GET OUR FIRST DIVE IN YET. GET OUT, GET SET UP AND, UH, FIND SOME GOLD. [ EXHALES ] MM. OH, THAT'S GOOD. -MM-HMM. COME ON, KONA. LET'S GO. I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A RISK-TAKER. I KNOW THERE'S A TON OF GOLD DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE. HOPEFULLY I DON'T GO BROKE LOOKIN' FOR IT, BUT, HELL, NOTHIN' VENTURED, NOTHIN' GAINED. LET'S GET SOME GOLD, BABY! Narrator: WHILE SHAWN AND HIS CREW BEGIN THE HUNT, 100 MILES TO THE WEST... ON CLAIM 14... I CAN GET THE HOSES SET UP FOR GETTIN' THE HOT WATER HEATER FIRED UP AGAIN. I BROUGHT A FIVER OF GAS OUT FOR THE GENERATOR. SWEET. ONCE BITTER ENEMIES, ZEKE TENHOFF AND EMILY RIEDEL HAVE FORMED AN ALLIANCE BEST DESCRIBED AS ICY. EMILY HAS ARRANGED A LABOR FORCE TO COME AND HELP HER. BUT WHAT I BELIEVE THAT EMILY NEEDS RIGHT NOW ARE THINGS THAT I HAVE -- I HAVE PERMITS. I HAVE THE SKILLS. IT'S A LOT OF WORK TO PULL OFF AN ICE OPERATION, AND ZEKE CAN'T DO IT BY HIMSELF. WE HAVE A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. I HAVE GOLD MONEY, AND I HAVE A TEAM I CAN OFFER. Narrator: EMILY'S TEAM -- A VERY UN-NOME-ISH TRIO OF CERTIFIED DIVERS -- SHELBY JOHNSON, JENN NEWBY, AND KENDALL WINSLOW. I THINK THEY'RE, LIKE, SCUBA CERTIFIED. BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY SPENT, LIKE, 1,000 HOURS WORKING UNDERWATER AND DEALING WITH ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG AFTER 1,000 HOURS OF WORKING UNDERWATER? PROBABLY NOT. FOR MORE DIVERS HOURS TO EQUAL MORE GOLD, THE FIRST STEP IS TO TURN DIVERS INTO MINERS. THIS IS A GAS COMPRESSOR. GAS RELEASES CARBON MONOXIDE. THE SAFEST WAY TO BREATHE OFF OF THIS IS FOR THE INTAKE HOSE TO BE SUPER LONG. THAT WAY WE'RE GETTING THE CLEANEST AIR POSSIBLE IN, AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT IT'S RUNNING OFF GAS. ALL RIGHT, LOVELY LADIES. UM, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? I DON'T WANNA BREATHE IN MONOXIDE. WELL, YEAH. THAT -- NOBODY'S -- YEAH, THAT -- THAT -- THAT NEVER IS IN ANYONE'S INTENT. AND THEN -- TO HAVE YOU GUYS BREATHE IN MONOXIDE. ALL RIGHT. I THINK WE'RE READY TO GEAR UP, Y'ALL. Narrator: FOR ONE OF EMILY'S GREENHORNS, LEARNING TO BE A NOME DIVER IS NOT LOOKING AS ENTICING AS ADVERTISED. UP HERE, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE'S JUST KIND OF LIKE, "OH, WELL, WE'LL JUST THROW THIS SYSTEM TOGETHER." WELL, IT'S GONNA POISON YOU. COULD KILL YOU, BUT, UM, PROBABLY JUST SLOWLY KILLING YOU. Narrator: THE FIRST ONE UP FOR BEING SLOWLY KILLED -- SIX-YEAR VETERAN ZEKE TENHOFF. SO IF THESE GIRLS ARE GONNA LEARN HOW TO DREDGE, THEY HAVE TO START OUT IN A PLACE WHERE THERE IS GOLD SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKIN' AT. AND I'M THE ONE THAT HAS TO PUT 'EM ON THE GOLD. YEAH! ARE YOU EXCITED TO SEE IT COME TOGETHER? I AM EXCITED TO SEE ZEKE GET IN THAT WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE A FEW GREENHORN DIVER GIRLS, AND, UM, ZEKE IS GONNA BE ABLE TO TEACH THEM A LOT ABOUT GOLD MINING. AND ALSO, WHETHER ZEKE LIKES IT OR NOT, UM, THE ONLY OTHER GREENHORN DIVER GIRL THAT'S EVER BEEN UP HERE IN NOME IS ME. AND HE DID PRETTY WELL WITH ME, YOU KNOW? [ AIR HISSING ] Zeke: [ Filtered voice ] ALL RIGHT. [ HISSING CONTINUES ] OKAY, YEAH. YOU'RE KEEPING A STEADY AT 80 P.S.I. UP HERE. Zeke: LOOKS PRETTY SAFE DOWN HERE, BUT I THINK I MIGHT SEE A DARK SHAPE OF, LIKE, A PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THERE... [ LAUGHING ] OH, A SEA MONSTER. THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THERE ARE TAILINGS PILES. WE'VE DREDGED IN THIS AREA BEFORE. Narrator: HAVING RECOVERED 150 OUNCES OF GOLD FROM THIS CLAIM LAST SUMMER, EMILY'S G.P.S. MARKS SHOULD LESSEN THE GUESSWORK IN THE SHORT WINTER SEASON. Zeke: I'M GONNA MOVE OVER TO SOME -- SOME MORE OF THIS STUFF THAT'S A LITTLE MORE ROCKY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PAY LAYER IS HERE. THIS PLACE LOOKS AS GOOD AS ANY AS A PLACE TO START OUT. [BLEEP] YEAH, MY COORDINATES DID. YES. HOW PSYCHED ARE THE GIRLS GONNA BE TO GET DOWN THERE? IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THERE'S SOME GOLD. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. IT'S BEAUTIFUL DOWN HERE. LOVE IT DOWN HERE IN THE WINTERTIME. I WASN'T SURE, YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE GONNA GET IN THE WATER TODAY OR ANYTHING, BUT IT HAPPENED, AND THAT'S AWESOME. Narrator: UNDER THE ICE, ZEKE IS ON PAY DIRT. Kendall: THERE'S SO MANY THINGS ABOUT THIS SYSTEM THAT AREN'T SAFE. I LIKE MY LIFE WAY MORE THAN I LIKE ANY POSSIBLE GOLD. Narrator: BUT TOPSIDE, NOT EVERYONE IS SHARING IN THE CELEBRATION. I MEAN, THAT WAS PROBABLY DUMB ON MY PART TO THINK THAT THERE WAS A SOLID OPERATION UP HERE, BUT... I'M JUST STARTIN' TO THINK THAT IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO BE HERE. Narrator: ONE HUNDRED MILES DOWN THE COAST... AT THE BLUFF... IT WILL BE EXCITING TO SEE WHAT'S DOWN THERE. GONNA GRAB THE CAMERA. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM, SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME STRUCTURE OR SOMETHIN' THAT WE LIKE, AND THEN WE'LL GO AFTER IT. ARMED WITH A WATERPROOF CAMERA, SHAWN POMRENKE, JACOB MUSICH, AND CODY MOEN ARE THE FIRST MINERS TO EVER PROSPECT THE BLUFF SEAFLOOR. HOPIN' TO FIND SOME BIG CHUNKS OF THAT YELLOW STUFF. WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR ROCK. SAND WITH A LITTLE DREDGE LIKE WE HAVE IS A LOT OF WORK JUST TO GET THROUGH THE SAND DOWN TO THE PAY LAYER, SO WE NEED TO FIND ROCK. SEE THAT COBBLE? I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START. LET'S DO IT. I MEAN, BASICALLY, WHAT WE'RE DOIN' IS MAPPIN' OUT THE GOLD IN A VERY LARGE AREA IN A VERY SHORT TIME. ON THIS TRIP, I'M LOOKIN' TO PICK UP, UH, YOU KNOW, 15, 20 OUNCES. IF I GET THAT, THEN IT'LL DEFINITELY BE WORTH BRINGIN' THE CHRISTINE ROSE DOWN THERE. I BROUGHT A LITTLE SOMETHIN' TO REMIND US ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. HUH? YEAH. CHRISTINE ROSE, JR. YEAH, THE LITTLE JUNIOR. I THINK I CAN. I THINK I CAN. THE LITTLE DREDGE. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: FINDING A SPOT RICH IN COBBLE, WHICH OFTEN INDICATES GOLD, IT'S TIME TO HIT THE WATER. NO! OH! [ MEN LAUGH ] [ LAUGHS ] GOT OUR DIVE TENT, A PLACE TO GET OUT OF THE WEATHER OR CHANGE, SET UP. NOW WE GOTTA GET THE MONKEY HEATER SET UP, GET THE PUMPS HOOKED UP, GET THE SLUICE BOX HOOKED UP, AND DO A DIVE. I'M KINDA EXCITED. I'M HOPIN' TO SEE GOLD RIGHT OFF THE BAT. FEELS GOOD TO GET TO THAT POINT TO WHERE WE GET TO KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE. HOPEFULLY GET SOME MONEY. I'M DROPPIN' THE PUMP IN FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT'S PERFECT. LET'S GET DOWN THERE AND SUCK SOME GOLD UP. [ MACHINERY WHIRRING ] [ BURSTING ] HOLY [BLEEP]! [ MAN SHOUTS ] [ BLEEP ] Narrator: AT THE BLUFF... [ MACHINERY WHIRRING ] [ BURSTING ] HOLY [BLEEP]! [ MAN SHOUTS ] [ BLEEP ] THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF AN ICE MINING OPERATION, SHAWN'S DIVE HEATER, IS UP IN SMOKE. [ MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] [ HISSING ] [ HISSING, CLICK ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] AH, LOOK AT THAT BIG OLD CRACK RIGHT THERE. OUR COIL INSIDE THE TANK RUPTURED, AND WITHOUT HOT WATER, WE CAN'T DIVE IN THIS FREEZING COLD WATER. Narrator: WITH THE FUTURE OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS RIDING ON THIS $30,000 EXPEDITION... [ BLEEP ] WE'RE [BLEEP], DUDE. ...SHAWN IS UP A CREEK WITHOUT A WATER HEATER. AIN'T NO COILS OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. [ BLEEP ] [ BARKING ] Narrator: ONE HUNDRED MILES WEST... AT THE WILD RANGER... [ Filtered voice ] LOOKS LIKE, UH, EVERYTHING'S GOOD TO GO. Vernon: ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA PUT IT IN MOTION. HERE WE GO WITH THE ANTIPUMP. ROGER. CAPTAIN VERNON ADKINSON IS LOOKING TO CHANGE THE FACE OF MINING IN NOME... WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF MATERIAL. [ AIR HISSES ] ALMOST PERFECT. ...TO SOMETHING WITHOUT A FACE. ROGER, ROGER. AFTER FOUR YEARS RUNNING MINING OPERATIONS... YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M [BLEEP] DOIN'? ...VERN HAS YET TO FIND THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB. GOIN' DOWN! SO HE'S TURNED TO A MACHINE. OH, MAN. THIS IS FANTASTIC. NOW... UH, SLING TO YOUR LEFT. SLING TO THE LEFT. ...HIS NEW GOLDEN SEAHORSE HAS REPLACED HUMANS ENTIRELY... DOWN WITH IT NOW. ...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ALL THOSE HUMANS HELPING HIM RUN IT. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT MATERIAL IN THE BOXES AND A LOT OF IT. IT'S ON THE GOLD RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH -- WITH A HUMAN. THIS MACHINE, IT'LL PUMP 120 TO 150 CUBIC YARDS PER HOUR. IT'S GOT 12 TIMES AS MUCH AS A SIPHON DREDGE. WHAT I'M BRINGING IT HERE FOR IS MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF GOLD. [ AIR HISSING ] HANG ON. ONE SECOND. [ HISSING CONTINUES ] THERE'S NO SUCTION. VERNON, YOU GOT A COPY? TAKE A TIME-OUT REAL QUICK? ROGER THAT. AH, [BLEEP]. LOOKS LIKE, UH, EVERYTHING'S STILL ATTACHED. WE THINK WE HAVE A PLUG. WE'RE, UH, TROUBLESHOOTING IT TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE IT'S LOCATED. NOTHING? WE'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE IMPELLER OR IF WE'VE GOT A ROCK STUCK IN THE INTAKE. [ AIR HISSING ] HEY, BOBBY, BILL'S GONNA RAISE THE NOZZLE UP INTO THE AIR. IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN GET OVER TO IT TO INSPECT THE NOZZLE? YEAH, ROGER THAT. OKAY. COMIN' UP. [ AIR HISSES ] YEAH, SEEMS LIKE THERE'S INTERFERENCE. Narrator: THE SUB-DREDGE'S CLASSIFIER BASKET IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT OBSTRUCTIONS FROM BEING SUCKED INTO THE PUMP, BUT THE BERING SEA PRESENTS A UNIQUE PROBLEM. THIS MATERIAL WE'RE WORKING IN, THEY'RE FLAT ROCKS, AND THEY'RE PACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. Vernon: OKAY, BOBBY, UH, WE'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND BRING IT UP. YEAH, ROGER THAT. Narrator: WITH SMALL, FLAT ROCKS CLOGGING THE INTAKE, VERNON IS FORCED TO BRING THE DREDGE TOPSIDE. WITH THE CLOCK TICKING ON THE ICE SEASON AND $100,000 IN THE HOLE, VERNON MUST ONCE AGAIN RELY ON MANPOWER... -PULL DOWN ON THAT NOZZLE. -YEAH, I GOTCHA. ...IN THE FORM OF CREW CHIEF... THAT'S PROBABLY ALL YOU NEED RIGHT THERE, CHIEF. ...DEREK McLARTY. -VERN? -IT'S NOT WORKING. IT LOOKS LIKE WE PROBABLY GOTTA GET SOME FLAT STOCK. WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT WELDING IN THESE WINDOWS, 'CAUSE UP HERE'S NOT DOIN' MUCH OF ANYTHING ANYWAY. YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE'RE SUCKIN' FROM. AND THEN MAYBE SOME PIECES OF REBAR WELDED IN HERE TO CLASSIFY THESE HOLES A LITTLE SMALLER. KNOCK THAT DOWN, GET RID OF THESE WINDOWS AND CLASSIFY A LITTLE BETTER. THAT'S A HELL OF A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. Vernon: IF YOU DID THE JOB, YOU'D TAKE IT TO YOUR SHOP. I'LL TACKLE IT. I JUST -- I JUST WANT THE OKAY. THAT'S ALL I'M LOOKIN' FOR. OKAY. MY MAJOR ROLE IS TO JUST LIGHT A FIRE UNDER VERN -- YOU KNOW, KEEP THE PACE UP. KEEP THE TEMPO GOIN'. GET IT DONE. THE ONLY THING I CAN'T MEND IS A SPIDERWEB AND A BROKEN HEART. OTHER THAN THAT, I GOT IT ALL. LOCKED AND LOADED. Narrator: ONE HUNDRED MILES TO THE EAST... AT THE BLUFF... HOPEFULLY I CAN GET IT THE FIRST PASS HERE. JUST MOMENTS FROM HIS FIRST DIVE ON VIRGIN GROUNDS, SHAWN POMRENKE BLEW A COIL IN THE WATER HEATER. WE CAN SEE ONE CRACK, BUT THERE'S PROBABLY A 200-FOOT COIL IN THERE, SO... HOPEFULLY HE CAN FIX IT OUT HERE. Narrator: FAR FROM HELP, THE ONLY OPTION -- WELD THE VISIBLE CRACK AND HOPE THERE ARE NO MORE. IT'S KINDA LIKE THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HERE. ARE WE GONNA HAVE HOT WATER OR NOT? PUT THE WATER TO IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS. HERE WE GO. [ CLICK, WHIRRING ] COME ON, BABY. LET'S GO. WELL, HE'S GETTIN' SOME WATER THERE. WE GOT HOT WATER FINALLY! WE DO HAVE HOT WATER. [ MEN LAUGH ] [ BLEEP ] HE WELDED IT. HE REALLY DID IT. Shawn: YEAH! WELL, HOPEFULLY ALL THIS HARD WORK PAYS OFF TODAY. EVERYTHING'S UP AND RUNNIN'. WE JUST GOTTA HOOK UP THE UMBILICAL, GET DIVE GEAR ON, GET DOWN THERE AND SUCK SOME GOLD UP. THE FIRST DIVE IN THE FIRST HOLE ON A GROUND WE'VE NEVER BEEN ON BEFORE -- IT'S KINDA A LITTLE NERVE-RACKING 'CAUSE YOU'RE WONDERING IF YOU SPENT ALL THIS MONEY FOR NOTHIN', OR DID YOU SPEND ALL THIS MONEY TO MAKE A TON OF MONEY? WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES, BUT, UH, I THINK IT'S THE GOLDEN MOMENT. Shawn: YEAH. -HELL YEAH. -I HOPE IT'S A GOOD ONE. I HOPE SO TOO, MAN. Shawn: I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD DAY. [ AIR HISSING ] I THINK I'M THE FIRST GUY THAT'S EVER PUT MY EYES ON THE BOTTOM OUT HERE. LITTLE DIFFERENT BOTTOM DOWN HERE. THE GROUND'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN, UH, ANYTHING WE'RE USED TO SEEIN', HUH? YEAH, IT'S WAY DIFFERENT. LOOKS GOOD DOWN HERE, GUYS. GO AHEAD. FIRE THOSE PUMPS UP. -ROGER. -GO! GONNA PUT THE NOZZLE TO THE BOTTOM AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. HOW'S EVERYTHING FEELIN' DOWN THERE, LIKE THE HOT WATER AND THE SUCTION? EVERYTHING UP HERE IS RUNNIN' REALLY GOOD. HEY, EVERYTHING FEELS REAL GOOD DOWN HERE. [ AIR HISSES ] LOOKS REALLY PROMISING. Narrator: THE FIRST MAN TO EVER TOUCH THE BLUFF SEAFLOOR. FOR SHAWN, JUST ONE THINGS REMAINS. [ BARKING ] Narrator: IN THE CITY OF NOME... THIS IS THE NOZZLE OFF OF VERNON'S SUB-DREDGE. LET'S GO. AND WE'RE GONNA MODIFY THIS TO WHERE WE WON'T GET ANY MORE ROCK JAMS. Narrator: WITH ONLY 3 1/2 WEEKS TO TURN AN ICE SEASON PROFIT, VERNON'S CREW CHIEF DEREK McLARTY WORKS TO GET THE SUB-DREDGE BACK ON ITS FEET. MY EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ROBOT ARE LIKE ANY OTHER NEW THING COMING UP -- 1 IN 30 WORKS. I'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. [ FLAME CRACKLING ] IT'S GONNA TAKE A BUNCH OF LEARNING CURVE. IF WE CAN LEARN FAST, IT'LL WORK. IF WE CAN'T, IT WON'T. IT'S NOTHIN' FANCY, BUT ALL WE'RE TRYIN' TO DO IS SEAL UP THESE WINDOWS SO THOSE BIGGER ROCKS CAN'T GET IT THERE AND JAM THIS UP. ALREADY GOT REBAR TACKED IN. I'LL GET THIS WHOLE THING TACKED UP. THEN WE'LL HEAT IT UP SO IT STICKS REAL GOOD AND PUT A BUNCH OF WELD ON IT. WHEN I WAS A KID, MY MOM QUIT GETTIN' ME REMOTE CONTROL CARS BECAUSE ALL I'D DO IS JUST TAKE 'EM APART. AND SHE HATED IT. OVER AND OVER, I'D JUST TAKE THESE THINGS APART. NEVER PUT 'EM BACK TOGETHER. JUST TAKE 'EM APART. SEE HOW THEY WORK. THEN I STARTED TAKIN' APART BIGGER THINGS AND BIGGER THINGS AND BIGGER THINGS, AND THEN BUILDING THINGS. AND THAT JUST SNOWBALLED. ONE DOWN, TWO TO GO. Narrator: WHILE DEREK RACES TO MAKE THE FIX... ONE MILE EAST OF THE HARBOR... AT THE CLARK... Emily: I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY EXCITED GIRLS UP HERE. THEY'RE REALLY HAPPY TO BE GETTING THE WATER, SO... OKAY, THAT'S GREAT, DUDE. IT'S A LOT OF FUN DOWN HERE. Narrator: AFTER FIVE HOURS UNDER THE ICE... -I'M GONNA COME UP. -ALL RIGHT. WHOO-HOO! Narrator: ...ZEKE IS WRAPPING HIS FIRST DIVE OF THE SEASON. I'M SO STOKED HE FOUND GOLD. WE'RE NEXT. WAY TO [BLEEP] KICK ASS, DUDE. [ LAUGHS ] THE WATER IS CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL, AND EVERYTHING IS [BLEEP]. ALL'S WELL IN THE FOREST. ALL RIGHT, LADIES. FIRST ARCTIC UNDER-THE-ICE DIVE, YOU READY? [ LAUGHS ] WHAT'S GOIN' ON? I'M NOT DIVING ON IT. Narrator: FOR GREENHORN KENDALL WINSLOW, THE DREDGE'S HOOKAH AIR SYSTEM IS TOO FAR OUTSIDE HER COMFORT ZONE. I THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE GONNA BE MORE CHECKS AND BALANCES. LIKE I SAID, KENDALL, IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDED TO BE KINDA PUT TOGETHER OUT ON THE ICE IN TERMS OF FITTINGS AND FIGURING [BLEEP] OUT. AND, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN NEVER GET A FULL -- FULLY SAFE AIR SYSTEM UP HERE. SO WHEN YOU CALLED ME THREE WEEKS AGO, YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S WHY I'M UPSET. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE AIR THAT I'M BREATHING IN THAT'S GOING TO MY BRAIN AND GOING TO MY WHOLE ENTIRE BODY THAT I HAVE TO LIVE WITH FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. KENDALL, YOU ARE 100 PERCENT IN CONTROL OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING UP HERE. AND IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE SITUATION, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE, TRULY. I -- I KNOW THAT YOU PROBABLY FEEL DECEIVED OR SOMETHING. I UNDERSTAND IT'S VERY UPSETTING. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO GET UPSET AT HER PERSONALLY. SHE IS NOT ON A PROFESSIONAL DIVING OPERATION. SHE IS ON A DIVING OPERATION FOR GOLD IN NOME, ALASKA. AND YOU KIND OF HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE 100 PERCENT SAFE. THIS IS [BLEEP] -- THIS IS DANGEROUS DIVING. THIS IS THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION. APPARENTLY THERE'S, LIKE, SOME GIRL DRAMA GOING ON. I'M NOT REALLY PAYING ALL THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. Emily: UH, THE FACT THAT ZEKE IS CARRYING SO MUCH OF THE LOAD, I FEEL LIKE I OWE IT TO HIM TO TRY TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE THIS OPERATION SUCCESSFUL. I CAN HANDLE THIS. AND I CAN BE A LEADER. LET'S, YOU AND I, GO OVER AND KINDA TAKE A LITTLE WALK. LET'S DO IT. OKAY, LET'S GO OVER HERE. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND ASK YOU TO GO HOME. LIKE, THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR ME. I DON'T THINK THIS IS WORKING FOR YOU. I -- I APPRECIATE YOU COMING UP HERE. AND I'M SORRY THAT THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT. WHEN I GOT UP HERE, YOU SAID THAT ALL YOUR SYSTEMS WOULD BE IN PLACE. AND THEN I GOT HERE, AND I LOOK AROUND, AND NOT ONE THING ON YOUR DREDGE OPERATION IS SAFE. AND I HAVE ZERO RESPECT FOR YOU. OKAY. OKAY. SO... WELL, THANKS FOR COMIN' UP, DUDE. I'M LEAVING TOO. UH, HAVE A VERY NICE FLIGHT. THANKS. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. IT'S JUST TIME FOR HER TO GO. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT. I HAVE ZERO PATIENCE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO TRUST ME AND BE FLEXIBLE. YOU CAN POINT OUT MY FAILURES AS MUCH AS YOU WANT BUT, LIKE, ACCUSING ME OF NEGLIGENCE IS -- IS, LIKE, A VERY -- [ SCOFFS ] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT KENDALL? SHE CALLED ME A FAT BOY WHEN I WAS IN EIGHTH GRADE. [ LAUGHS ] I HAVE NOT FORGIVEN HER FOR THAT. [ LAUGHING ] AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL. SHE PROBABLY DOESN'T REMEMBER IT 'CAUSE, LIKE, IN EIGHTH GRADE, WHEN YOU'RE KENDALL WINSLOW, AND YOU'RE LIKE -- LIKE ALL PLATINUM BLONDE AND [BLEEP], YOU'RE LIKE, "I'M IN EIGHTH GRADE NOW, AND MY BOOBS GREW. "AND NOW I'M IN EIGHTH GRADE, AND, LIKE, I CAN CALL THE BOYS FAT." LIKE, THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. NEVER GONNA FORGIVE HER. NO, DEAR GOD. Narrator: ON THAT NOTE... 3 MILES WEST... AT THE WILD RANGER... Vernon: WE GOT TO TEST OUT THE SUB-DREDGE, PART OF THE PROCESS OF DEBUGGING THE SYSTEMS. Narrator: REBAR, NEWLY WELDED AROUND THE CLASSIFIER... WE TIGHTENED UP ON THE, UH, SORTING BASKET, WELDED SOME PLATING OVER SOME OF THE OPENING... Narrator: ...IT'S TIME TO SEE IF DEREK'S FIX SOLVED THE PROBLEM -- OR MADE IT WORSE. HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING'S JUST GONNA CLASSIFY THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO AT THE NOZZLE, NOT HAVE ANY CLOG-UPS NOW THAT WE'VE GONE TO A LARGER DIAMETER DISCHARGE. GO DOWN. [ WHIRRING ] Vernon: THAT'S GOOD. GAME ON! Narrator: WITH $100,000 ALREADY SPENT, ANOTHER MISFIRE WILL BE CRUSHING FOR THE SKIPPER. [ AIR BUBBLING ] TWO FEET. TOUCHDOWN. THAT'S GOOD! I'M GONNA GO IN AND STAY ON COMMS. YOU DIRECT THE SHOW OUT HERE. I'LL TALK TO YOU THROUGH THE DOOR. SOUNDS GOOD. I'LL WATCH IT. ALL RIGHT. AND THEN, UM, ONCE YOU GET IT ALL LATCHED IN, LET US KNOW, AND, UH, WE'LL FIRE UP THE PUMP AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, OVER. ROGER. [ AIR HISSES ] ALL RIGHT. IT'S OUTSIDE. I'M JUST STANDING BY FOR, UH, PUMP ACTION. [ AIR HISSING ] AND...GOOD. STOP, MAN. BRING THE HEAD DOWN. YEAH, THAT SHOULD BE GOOD TO DO IT RIGHT THERE. OKAY. WE'RE GOIN' TO WORK. [ GRINDING ] YEAH, WE'RE GETTIN' REAL GOOD MATERIAL FLOW THROUGH THE, UH, SLUICE BOX ALSO. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS. IT'S LOOKIN' REAL GOOD UP HERE. IT'S LOOKIN' LIKE MONEY TO ME, BABY. DEREK, HE'S A DAMN GOOD MECHANIC. HE'S JUST KIND OF AN ALL-AROUND DO-IT-ALL KINDA GUY. THE KINDA PERSON YOU NEED FOR, UH -- FOR NOME. ALL THE EQUIPMENT IS LOOKING GOOD. WE DO THE CLEANOUT, I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD GOLD OUTTA THIS HOLE. THAT'S GOOD MATERIAL COMIN' THROUGH THAT BOX. LOOK AT THAT [BLEEP]. Narrator: ONE MILE EAST OF NOME HARBOR... AT THE CLARK... IN ALL HONESTY, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET UNDERWATER. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THE TEAM IS ALREADY DOWN A DIVER, SO THE PRESSURE'S ON FOR GREENHORN SHELBY JOHNSON. SHE'S NOT JUST HERE TO DIVE UNDER THE ICE FOR THE EXPERIENCE, SHE'S HERE TO BE A GOLD MINER. THE SOONER SHE JUST GETS DOWN THERE, GETS COMFORTABLE, SHE CAN START MAKING US SOME GOLD. WE NEED TO GET THESE GIRLS ON GOLD STAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SOME MONEY BEFORE THE SEASON'S OVER. AT THIS POINT, WE JUST USE THE HOSE AS A LADDER. MM-HMM. JUST CRAWL UP AND DOWN THE HOSE. I'M NOT GONNA PULL IT OFF? NO, NO, NO. IT'S ALL -- IT'S ALL SECURE. I MEAN, JUST STAY CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE HOSE THAT, LIKE, IF YOU'RE FEELING THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG... I MEAN, IT TAKES, LIKE, YOU KNOW, A FEW SECONDS TO GO UP. I'M DEFINITELY HERE TO PROVE THAT I CAN DO THIS. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE AS FAR AS SCUBA DIVING AND THE UNDERWATER WORLD GOES. SO NOW I JUST NEED TO PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS. IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY, WE GOTTA GET PEOPLE COMFORTABLE WITH THE SYSTEMS, COMFORTABLE DIVIN' WITH THIS TETHER AND THIS HOT WATER SYSTEM AND OUR AIR SYSTEM. AND THEN WE GOTTA GET DOWN TO DREDGING. [ AIR HISSES ] [ AIR HISSING CONTINUES ] Emily: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE ICE? [ LAUGHS ] [ Filtered voice ] OH, IT'S SO PRETTY. [ AIR HISSES ] I'M GONNA WALK AROUND A LITTLE, GET MY BEARINGS. THE VISIBILITY IS AMAZING DOWN HERE. I'M AT THE END OF THE HOSE. LOOK LIKE IT'S ONLY 22 FEET DOWN HERE. IT'S PRETTY SHALLOW. [ AIR HISSING ] AWESOME -- STARFISH! LITTLE BABY STARFISH. I'M SORRY. I'M LOOKIN' FOR GOLD, I PROMISE. [ LAUGHS ] [ RUMBLING ] [ RUMBLING CONTINUES ] HEY, SHELBY, THIS COMPRESSOR WE HAVE, IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE IT'S KEEPIN' UP THAT WELL. WE'RE WATCHIN' IT, SO IF IT STARTS TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE OR DIFFICULT TO BREATHE, ACT ACCORDINGLY. Narrator: ANYTHING BELOW 80 P.S.I., THE MEASUREMENT OF COMPRESSED AIR A DIVER RECEIVES, CAN MAKE BREATHING A STRUGGLE. Emily: HEY, SHEL, YOUR, UM -- YOUR AIR PRESSURE IS STARTING TO DIP BELOW 40 P.S.I. SO, YOU FEEL GOOD DOWN THERE? I FEEL GREAT DOWN HERE. YOU WANT ME TO START PUNCHING HOLES? UM, YEAH. LET ME GO THROTTLE UP, AND THEN YOU CAN START PUNCHING SOME HOLES, ALL RIGHT. STAND BY. Narrator: THEY MAY HAVE LOST ONE GREENHORN TO NERVES... GO ALL THE WAY. I COULD GET USED TO THIS BAD BOY. Narrator: BUT SHELBY IS HOLDING STRONG. Shelby: WHOA! WELL, I SEE SHINY STUFF. Zeke: CLEARLY SHELBY LIKES TO DIVE. AND SHE'S COMFORTABLE WHEN SHE GETS UNDERWATER. AND SO THAT PRETTY MUCH JUST MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. Emily: ARE YOU MOVING ANY MATERIAL? YEAH, JUST SMALL MATERIAL. DON'T WANNA BE TOO ROUGH THE FIRST TIME, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE THE GIRLS UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, AND THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT. LIKE, THERE'S A GIRL DIVING RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE ALL DOING IT. I'M JUST SITTING HERE ON MY COUCH. THAT'S GOOD. I REALLY AM ENJOYING MYSELF. [ GROWLING ] Narrator: ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST... BACK AT THE BLUFF... [ AIR HISSING ] [ Filtered voice ] COME ON, BABY. WHERE'S THE GOLD AT? Narrator: SHAWN POMRENKE IS ON THE HUNT FOR A PAY LAYER. Shawn: I WANNA HEAD TOWARDS THE BEACH AND SEE WHAT I SEE OUT THIS WAY. Cody: YEAH, SHAWN'S DOING ALL RIGHT. HE'S FOUND A LOT -- LITTLE PIECES HERE AND THERE. HE'S... SEVEN, EIGHT PIECES HERE AND THERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' DOWN THERE. WE GOTTA FIND THE SOURCE. FIND THE SOURCE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOIN' DOWN AND LOOKIN' FOR A LITTLE PAY STREAK, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO KEEP A DIFFERENT MIND-SET. WE'RE PROSPECTING FOR THE BIG DREDGE. [ AIR HISSING ] YEAH, I'M GONNA JUST KEEP, UH, TAKIN' A LOOK HERE. I'M SEEIN' SOME SAND TO THE... [ AIR HISSES ] THE EAST OF US. THEN IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME NICE COBBLE COMIN' UP. Cody: ARE YOU JUST WALKING AROUND AND LOOKING, OR ARE YOU, UH, DREDGIN'? JUST WALKIN' AROUND HERE LOOKIN', TRYIN' TO SEE IF I WAS SOME GOLD, WHERE I'D BE HIDIN'. LOOKS PRETTY INTERESTING HERE. RIGHT -- RIGHT HERE IS THE BEACH. IT SEEMS THE BOTTOM'S COMIN' UP PRETTY FAST. THIS MIGHT BE THE -- MIGHT BE THE SPOT. I'M GONNA GRAB THE HOSE. WHERE HE WENT ON HIS LITTLE WALK, OVER THERE TO THE WEST, HE'S FINDIN' SOME MORE GOLD, A LITTLE BETTER. IT'S GETTIN' BETTER AND BETTER AS HE'S HEADIN' THAT WAY. Shawn: THIS STUFF DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD. GOLD SEEMS TO BE GETTIN' A LITTLE BETTER GOIN' TOWARDS THE WEST HERE. SO YOU THINK THERE'S ENOUGH GOLD TO STICK AROUND FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS, OR ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE? YEAH, WE'LL PROBABLY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WHAT I FOUND TODAY TO BRING THE CHRISTINE ROSE OUT HERE, BUT IT LOOKS PROMISING. YEAH, IF YOU'RE SEEING GOLD ON THE FIRST DIVE, I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA END UP FINDING SOMETHING GOOD. I'M COMIN' ON UP. ROGER THAT. Narrator: AFTER FIVE HOURS ON THE BLUFF SEAFLOOR, SHAWN'S FOUND WHAT COULD BE THE FIRST TRACES OF A GOLD VEIN. NICE WORK, BRO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE OVER A LITTLE BIT. THERE AIN'T MUCH GOLD OVER HERE, BUT WE DID -- I DID START SEEIN' SOME NICE LITTLE PIECES OVER THIS WAY. Narrator: WITH THE EXPEDITION'S FIRST SIGHT OF COLOR IN THE SLUICE BOX... GOOD SIGN. THERE'S GOLD IN THERE, YEAH. ...MR. GOLD IS OFFICIALLY ON THE SCENT. YOU -- YOU ALWAYS GOT HIGH HOPES ON YOUR FIRST DIVE. YOU EXPECT TO GO DOWN THERE AND JUST SEE MOUNTAINS AND PILES AND PILES OF GOLD EVERYWHERE. I WANNA GET SOME GOLD AND ACTUALLY RECOUP SOME OF THAT MONEY THAT I PUT INTO THIS EXPEDITION. BUT IT AIN'T GONNA COME EASY. WE AIN'T FILTHY RICH, BUT AT LEAST WE'RE FINDIN' IT. Narrator: FAR AWAY FROM ANY GROCERY STORE... NOBODY EVER CRABS DOWN HERE, IT'S SO FAR OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. I'M HOPIN' THERE'S SOMETHIN' IN THIS POT. Narrator: GOLD IS NOT THE ONLY THING THE BLUFF CREW IS REELING IN. THE BERING SEA HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT BOUNTIES IT GIVES UP, AND, YOU KNOW, KING CRAB IS ONE OF THOSE. OH! OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH. CRAB LEGS, BABY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, KONA? NOT A BAD DAY OF FISHIN' THERE. CRAB DINNER TONIGHT. HECK YEAH. HEY, BRING THAT BACK HERE! KONA! YOU LITTLE [BLEEP]. LET THE POT SOAK OVERNIGHT, COME BACK TOMORROW MORNING AND SEE WHAT WE GOT FOR A BOUNTY. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... AT THE WILD RANGER... OUR FIRST CLEANUP RIGHT HERE, UH, WE'RE JUST ABOUT FINISHED UP WITH IT. Narrator: DIVER SPENSER McCLESKEY PANS OUT THE FIRST CLEANUP FROM VERNON'S NEW GOLDEN SEAHORSE. GETTIN' IT ALL CLEANED UP SO WE CAN ALL GET PAID. IN THE LITTLE BIT OF TIME THAT WE DID GET THE ROBOT RUNNIN', IT WAS PUMPING MORE MATERIAL THAN I'VE EVER SEEN A DREDGE PUMP. Narrator: WITH EXPECTATIONS RUNNING HIGH, IT'S TIME TO FRY UP SOME GOLD. THIS CLEANUP WAS JUST A SHORT RUN ON THE BIKE, PROBABLY 20 HOURS. COUPLE NICE PICKERS IN THERE, NICE COURSE GOLD. ALL RIGHT. FIRST CLEANOUT, FIRST WEIGH OF THE SEASON. 5... 6... 7.25. YEAH! GREAT! 7.25 OUNCES IS WORTH NEARLY $10,000. THAT'S A THIRD OF AN OUNCE AN HOUR. THAT PULL WAS DOUBLE WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS. I'M PRETTY SATISFIED WITH THIS. WE STILL GOT A GOOD BIT OF THE SEASON LEFT. IF WE GET ON THE GOLD AND HAMMER IT, WE CAN STILL MAKE A DECENT SHOWING. MY GOAL IS 70 OUNCES. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. BOOM. Narrator: OVER ON CLAIM 14... I ACTUALLY HADN'T EXPECTED IT TO BE SO VISIBLE. WITH JUST OVER THREE WEEKS TO TURN A PROFIT, TEAM CLARK IS ALSO LOOKING TO CASH IN. Zeke: I MEAN, THOSE ARE, LIKE, CHUNKS IN THERE. I KNOW! THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING. OKAY. THOSE ARE CHUNKS. REALLY STRONG, DUDE. YEAH. AH, COOL. NO, IT SUCKS. I HATE CHUNKY GOLD. BUT IT'S STILL GOOD, DUDE, BECAUSE IT'S STILL GOLD. LIKE, THE VETERANS ARE LIKE, "EH, THAT'S NOT A LOT OF GOLD." AND WE'RE LIKE, "AWESOME." I KNOW. SO MUCH GOLD. I CAN SEE IT. WHAT? I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH BEING A PART OF AN EXPERIMENT WHERE WOMEN ARE INJECTED INTO THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO BE PROVEN THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY INTO THIS NOME MINING SITUATION AND REALLY MAKE SOMETHING OF IT. YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING IT WAS, LIKE, 8 HOURS ON THIS BOX, IF THERE'S 2 OUNCES IN THIS PAN, THAT MEANS THAT THAT WAS A QUARTER OUNCE AN HOUR. IS THAT HOW THE MATH WORKS? YEAH. NOW WE'RE GONNA DRY IT OUT, DUDE. OKAY. CALL IT GOOD TO GO. WE CAN WEIGH IT. ALL RIGHT! [ EXCITED CHATTER ] OKAY. LOOK AT THAT! 2.8 OUNCES. Narrator: 2.8 OUNCES IS 3,300 BUCKS, MADE IN JUST EIGHT HOURS OF WORK. Emily: WE'RE ON SOME [BLEEP] GOOD GROUND. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. A 6-INCH ACHIEVING THAT AMOUNT OF GOLD IN SO FEW HOURS, IT'S GREAT FOR US, AND WE NEED TO ACTUALLY BE MAKING SOME SERIOUS MONEY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME. OUR RATE OF RECOVERY PER DIVING TIME IS QUITE GOOD. WE'VE DONE WAY WORSE THAN THAT AND BEEN HAPPY ABOUT IT. Narrator: ONE HUNDRED MILES TO THE EAST... BACK AT THE BLUFF... FIRE FEELS GOOD. MOVE ON DOWN AND GET IN FRONT OF WHERE THOSE OLD-TIMERS WORKED. YEAH. WE'VE BEEN NICE AND CLOSE. I MEAN, WE'RE JUST RIGHT THERE. WE CAN VENTURE OFF A LITTLE BIT FURTHER FROM CAMP NOW. Narrator: LIVING OFF THE GRID, FIXING WATER HEATERS ON THE FLY, AND STRIKING THEIR FIRST GOLD CALLS FOR CELEBRATION. Shawn: CRAB'S JUST ANOTHER BERING SEA GOLD. YEAH. AND I ENJOY THE HELL OUTTA BOTH OF THEM. WELL, WE FOUND THE CRAB AND WEREN'T EVEN REALLY TRYING, SO MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE OUR ATTITUDE ABOUT THE GOLD. [ LAUGHS ] YOU WANT 'EM? YEAH! OH, YEAH! [ LAUGHING ] GOT A LITTLE CRAB TOO, KONA? SHE'S LOVIN' IT. SHELL AND ALL. THAT'S GONNA HURT COMIN' OUT TOMORROW. Shawn: AFTER ALL THIS HARD WORK, THIS IS A NICE LITTLE TREAT. I COULD FALL ASLEEP RIGHT HERE, MY STOMACH'S FULL -- SO FULL OF CRAB. LET'S GO TO BED, MAN. I'VE HAD ENOUGH FOR TODAY. WE GOT A LONG DAY AHEAD OF US TOMORROW. I DON'T EVEN THINK I'M GETTIN' OUT OF MY GEAR TONIGHT. I'M GONNA CRAWL IN MY SLEEPIN' BAG. ANYTHING THIS TOUGH HAS GOTTA BE WORTH IT. WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO, BOYS. LET'S GET SOME SLEEP. TURN THAT [BLEEP] LIGHT OFF. Narrator: VERNON AND HIS GOLDEN SEAHORSE ARE ON TOP OF THE BOARD, BUT DON'T SLEEP ON MR. GOLD. EVERYTHING'S GOOD FOR A CHANGE. THAT COULD'VE HURT. THAT'S A NICE NUGGET, MAN. YOU'RE STEAMIN' LIKE A [BLEEP]. YAHOO! STOP! MOOSE! KONA! GET BACK HERE. YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF RIPPING YOUR MASK UP UNDERWATER, WHICH IS BULL[BLEEP]. YEAH, MAN. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN THE REEF HERE, WHERE I BELONG. I MIGHT BE [BLEEP] -- 50/50 CHANCE AT THIS POINT. 60/40 CHANCE I'M [BLEEP].
