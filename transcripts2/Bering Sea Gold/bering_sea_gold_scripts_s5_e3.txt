 THE STARS HAVE ALIGNED, AND WE FOUND OURSELVES ON SOME PRETTY GOOD GOLD. AND WE GOTTA GO DOWN THERE AND JUST MOVE MATERIAL. DON'T COME BACK WITHOUT SOME GOLD. Narrator: AT THE PADDY WAGON, ROOKIE DREDGE OWNER KRIS KELLY AND HIS LITTLE BROTHER... OH. ARE FINALLY OUT FROM DAD'S DARK SHADOW. NOW, I HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT MYSELF. IT'S ALL ON ME. AND, YOU KNOW, THE LAST 10 SECONDS OF THE GAME, I WANT THE BALL. THAT'S ALL I GOTTA SAY. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS [ WIND HOWLING ] [ BLUSTERING, GRUNTING ] Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ON CLAIM 14... HEY, EZEKIEL, WHAT'S THE, UH, GROUND LOOK LIKE DOWN THERE? YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THAT THESE SANDY AREAS MIGHT BE PLACES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DREDGED BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE OVERBURDEN ON THEM. Narrator: WITH THE FIRST WEEK OF DREDGING IN THE BOOKS, THE UNLIKELY ALLIANCE OF ZEKE AND EMILY IS STILL HOLDING STRONG. WE FOUND GOLD ON VERY TINY AMOUNTS OF OVERBURDEN ON THE SLUICE BEFORE. SOUNDS GOOD. RIGHT NOW, IT'S PRACTICAL FOR ZEKE AND I TO WORK TOGETHER IN A BUSINESS CAPACITY. WE KNOW WE'RE ON GOOD GOLD. WE GOT 2.8 OUNCES IN, LIKE, BASICALLY ESSENTIALLY 8 OR 9 HOURS. Narrator: SO FAR THIS SEASON... ZEKE'S EQUIPMENT AND SKILLS... [BLEEP] YEAH, THAT COORDINATE'S GOOD. YES. Narrator: ...ALONG WITH EMILY'S GPS HOT SPOTS AND GREENHORNS... Zeke: 2.8 OUNCES. Narrator: ...HAVE BROUGHT IN A COOL 3,300 BUCKS. OKAY, YEAH, I'M STARTING TO SEE SOME QUITE DECENT GOLD DOWN HERE. Narrator: NOW... DOES IT LOOK LIKE WE HAVE A GOOD SPOT FOR SHELBY AND JEN TO START DIVIN'? Narrator: TO CASH IN ON THE SHORT SEASON, THE PAIR MUST KEEP THE GREENHORNS ON GOLD... 10-4. Narrator: EVERY SINGLE SHIFT. SO BEAUTIFULLY EASY. [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] OKAY. HERE WE GO. DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT. BUT -- BUT IT'S REALLY NOT AND I'M COLD. [ CHUCKLES ] EVEN IF IT'S FOR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, WE COULD MAKE SOME DECENT MONEY IF WE ALL GET OUR HEADS IN THE SAME GAME AND WE HIT IT HARD AND WE GRIND. HOW I'M DOIN' THAT IS LAYIN' DOWN GLOW STICKS ON THE TRAJECTORY THAT I KNOW THE GOLD TO BE GOING. WE'RE GONNA SEND IN SHELBY NEXT. AND THEN, WE'RE GONNA SEND JEN IN. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ALL THE LADIES SPLASHIN' AROUND UP IN THERE. ZEKE IS A PROSPECTOR. HE EXPLORES, AND HE LOOKS, AND HE LEARNS HOW TO READ THE BOTTOM. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ZEKE KNOWS REALLY WELL HOW TO FOLLOW GOLD AND HOW MUCH THERE IS IN THAT AREA. GO STRAIGHT DOWN. AND THEN YOU GET OVER HERE, AND THAT'S END OF THE HOSE. BOOM. RIGHT THERE. LITTLE HANDLE. [BLEEP] AND THEN, ALONG HERE, I DUG THROUGH THE OVERBURDEN AND EXPOSED THE PAY LAYER. AND THEN, I PUT A GLOW STICK, LIKE, EVERY 3 OR 4 FEET. AND YOU'LL SEE THOSE. GLOW STICK, GLOW STICK, GLOW STICK. IN THE -- IN THE CENTER OF A LITTLE CIRCLE, THERE WERE SOME FLAKES OF GOLD. AND THEN, I STACKED LITTLE WHITE ROCKS LIKE A LITTLE CAMPFIRE. THIS ALL NEEDS TO BE DREDGED. ALL OF THAT LOOKS GOOD. IT SHOULD BE PRETTY APPARENT TO YOU. Narrator: HEADING DOWN FOR HER SECOND DIVE UNDER THE ICE... SO GO GET MASKED UP. Narrator: CERTIFIED DIVE MASTER SHELBY JOHNSON. THIS OPPORTUNITY HAS DEFINITELY LET ME FULFILL A DREAM. IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT I KNEW WAS GONNA BE A CAKEWALK. BUT, UH, I GREW UP WITH BROTHERS, AND BROTHERS ALWAYS WERE TELLIN' ME THAT I COULDN'T DO THINGS. I ALWAYS HAD SOMETHIN' TO PROVE. [ LAUGHS ] [ WATER BUBBLING ] Zeke: ALL RIGHT. HOW DOES THAT FEEL WATER-WISE? IT FEELS FANTASTIC, ZEKE, THANK YOU. OKAY. IT LOOKS PRETTY DOWN HERE. DEFINITELY LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST PLACE. OKAY. I SEE THE GLOW STICKS. 'KAY. AW, ZEKE, THIS IS SO CUTE. YOU'RE SO SWEET. YOU SEE THOSE LITTLE PIECES OF GOLD THERE IN THE LITTLE CIRCLE? YEAH, I DO. SHELBY, SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOIN' FOR. SO THERE'S, LIKE, A WHOLE BUNCH OF THOSE LITTLE PIECES, AND THEY'RE UNDER THE ROCKS THAT ARE IN FRONT AND, LIKE, ALL OVER THE PLACE. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S SO GREAT. ISN'T IT SO PRETTY? IT'S SO PRETTY. IT'S SO PRETTY! I'M REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. I'M MOTIVATED. GOT SOME GOOD SUCTION. Narrator: WHILE SHELBY FOLLOWS THE TRAIL, 100 MILES TO THE EAST, AT THE BLUFF... ...MR. GOLD. BOY, THAT'S A PRETTY VAST AREA RIGHT HERE. THAT... THERE'S A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER. Narrator: SHAWN POMRENKE IS BLAZING A NEW ONE. CLAIMS GO FROM HERE TO HERE, SO WE JUST GOTTA CHECK OUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HERE. Narrator: THIS WINTER, SHAWN'S INVESTED NEARLY 30 GRAND ON AN EXPEDITION TO FIND GOLD DEEP IN THE WILD. PROSPECTING DOWN AT THE BLUFF THIS WINTER, IT'S A WHOLE NEW AREA. IT'S NOT LIKE THE TOMCOT, WHERE I'VE BEEN ON THERE 15 YEARS AND KNOW -- KNOW THE BOTTOM LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND. I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. Narrator: FOUR DAYS AGO... THIS MIGHT BE THE -- MIGHT BE THE SPOT. Narrator: ON THE FIRST DIVE HOLD OF THE SEASON... THERE'S GOLD IN THE AREA. Narrator: THE MISSION GOT ITS FIRST TASTE OF SUCCESS. AND HERE'S ONE OF THOSE OTHER BEACHLINES. FIND SOME GOLD THERE. Narrator: RISKING THE FAMILY NAME AND THE FAMILY BUSINESS, SHAWN AND HIS CREW ARE LOOKING TO STEP IT UP. I MEAN, IT'S A BIG RISK AND SPENDIN' A LOTTA MONEY DOIN' IT, BUT HOPEFULLY, IT PAYS OFF BIG. I THINK I COULD CONQUER THE BLUFF JUST BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE JOE. WELL, WE SHOULD GET EVERYTHING TOPPED OFF, FUELED UP. Narrator: BUT JUST OVER ONE WEEK INTO THE TRIP... HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOIN' ON FUEL? WE'RE GETTIN' PRETTY LOW ON THE TRACK TRUCK. I GOT A LITTLE. I GOT A QUARTER TANK IN MY SNOW MACHINE. THOSE ARE ALL EMPTY. Narrator: THERE'S A MAJOR PROBLEM. WE'VE ONLY GOT 2 DAYS AND -- BEFORE YOU BURN [BLEEP] 200 GALLONS OF GAS ALMOST. ALL THOSE BREAKDOWNS, THE MONKEY HEATER BREAKIN' DOWN AND BURNIN'... WE BURNED A LOTTA GAS. NEED TO GET MORE FUEL IF WE'RE GONNA FIND SOME GOLD AROUND HERE. Narrator: UNDERESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF FUEL IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THERE AND RUN THE ENGINES, THEY'RE LEFT WITHOUT EVEN ENOUGH TO MAKE IT BACK TO TOWN. SON OF A BITCH. [BLEEP] WE RAN OUTTA FUEL. DEVASTATING. IT'S NOT A MORALE BOOSTER AT ALL. I'M GETTIN' MY ASS KICKED OUT HERE. IT SUCKS. THERE'S A VILLAGE JUST IN FROM HERE THAT WE CAN GO HEAD UP, GET SOME FUEL THERE. TO WHITE MOUNTAIN? I THINK I CAN. Narrator: THE TINY VILLAGE OF WHITE MOUNTAIN, POPULATION 200, 77 MILES FROM NOME AND NEARLY 30 FROM THE BLUFF, IS SHAWN'S ONLY HOPE TO GAS UP AND AVOID CALLING FOR RESCUE. HOPEFULLY, I DON'T GET STUCK. WE'LL FIND YA. IF YOU'RE NOT BACK BY DARK, WE'LL COME LOOK FOR YA. THERE'S NOTHING GONNA STOP US FROM MINING HERE. I'M GONNA VENTURE OUT AND GO TO THIS VILLAGE, GET ENOUGH FUEL TO KEEP ON MININ', AND I AIN'T GONNA QUIT. WELL, I'M GONNA GO FOR FUEL. YOU GUYS, UH, GO PROSPECTING OUT HERE ON THE CLAIM. ALL RIGHT. [ ENGINE STARTS ] LET'S GO. Narrator: WITH JUST OVER 2 WEEKS REMAINING IN THE SEASON, FINDING WHITE MOUNTAIN AND REPLENISHING THE FUEL IS MAKE-OR-BREAK FOR THE POMRENKE CREW. 100 MILES WEST... JUST WEST OF THE HARBOR... HOW'S THAT NEW COMPRESSOR WORKIN' OUT? IT IS WORKIN' OUT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. Narrator: KRIS KELLY AND HIS BROTHER ANDY ARE PREPPING FOR A FULL DAY'S WORK. THAT'S GOOD. LEAVE IT RIGHT THERE. LET IT WARM UP NOW. MY BROTHER AND I HAVE TEAMED UP TO BEGIN TO TRY OUR HAND. I THINK THAT I CAN BE NUMBER ONE ON THE SCOREBOARD. I CAN BEAT EVERYBODY THIS YEAR IF ANDY AND I JUST FOCUS AND WE WORK HARD. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS UNDER OUR FEET TODAY. HEY, LET'S STAY POSITIVE. I'M POSITIVE. Narrator: JUST A FEW FEET AWAY... THE RACE IS STILL ON WITH THE KIDS. I GUESS IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS, THE RACE IS STILL ON. Narrator: THEIR OLD MAN, BRAD, IS ALSO FIRING UP. THE BIG RACE IS TO SEE WHO GETS THE MOST GOLD, RIGHT? THAT'S THE RACE. Narrator: A WEEK AGO... I GOT A DIVER GOING DOWN! GOOD FOR YOU. Narrator: AFTER SETTING CAMP RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE OLD MAN... IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW, DUDE. Narrator: THE BROTHERS WERE THE FIRST ONES TO HIT PAY DIRT. PADDY WAGON'S FIRST ON GOLD THIS SEASON. EVERYBODY ELSE CAN [BLEEP] OFF. Narrator: NOW... HOW'S IT GOIN', BOYS? I WANT AN OUNCE AN HOUR. I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE AND MAKE SOME [BLEEP] MONEY. DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT THAT. WE MAKE SO MUCH [BLEEP] WE THROW IT ALL OVER THE ICE. Narrator: IT'S TIME FOR ROUND TWO. KRIS SPLITTIN' OFF IS ACTUALLY HURTIN' BOTH OF US. HE DOESN'T REALIZE IT, BUT IT DOES. IT'S TAKEN HALF OUR MONEY AWAY, PUT IT INTO TWO OPERATIONS. YOU JUST...THE WHOLE THING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, YOU KNOW? I DON'T WANNA HAVE FUN. I WANNA MAKE MONEY. I'M NOT [BLEEP] HERE LIVING THE DREAM. I'M HERE TRYING TO GET PAID. I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET ON THE GOLD RIGHT AWAY. NO PROSPECTING. Narrator: THE BOYS' ONLY PROBLEM... [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] WHAT'S THAT NOISE? YOU HEAR THAT? I MEAN, IT'S NOT MAKIN' ME FEEL SAFE RIGHT NOW, LET ME TELL YA. I'M NOT FEELIN' GOOD ABOUT THAT ENGINE. Narrator: THE CUT-RATE GEAR THEY'RE USING TO GET THE GOLD. OH, [BLEEP]. WHOLE ENGINE IS GARBAGE, MAN. I'VE GOT ALL THIS EQUIPMENT, AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY GREAT EQUIPMENT. I BOUGHT ALL MY DAD'S [BLEEP] EQUIPMENT AT A B-- A REALLY GOOD DEAL. I DON'T THINK MY BROTHER REALLY WANTED TO PUT A WHOLE LOTTA MONEY INTO DREDGING. HE BOUGHT MY DAD'S FAULTY EQUIPMENT. HE SHOULD'VE BOUGHT NEW OR SOMETHING ELSE. TIME FOR ME TO STEP UP, GET DOWN THERE, MAKE SOME [BLEEP] MONEY. AND TRY NOT TO DIE AT THE SAME TIME. [ AIR HISSES ] [ BLEEP ] IT'S COLD DOWN HERE. GROUND FLOOR. OKAY. OH, YEAH. IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD SO FAR. THERE'S GOLD ALREADY. LOOKS LIKE THAT BLACK [BLEEP]. HE SAYS HE'S ON GOLD. GOD, I HATE LISTENING TO HIS VOICE, EVEN ON A COMM BOX. HEY, WHAT IF I, UH... ♪ Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... AT THE PADDY WAGON... HEY, WHAT IF I, UH... SOMETHING'S [BLEEP] WRONG! LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT THE [BLEEP] THE PROBLEM IS! HOT WATER LINE. Narrator: THE PUMP SEAL REGULATES HOT WATER FLOWING TO THE DIVER. WITHOUT ONE, THE BOYS ARE RISKING THIRD-DEGREE BURNS. GO. COME OUTTA THE HOLE. [BLEEP] EVERY [BLEEP] TIME I [BLEEP] TURN AROUND THIS [BLEEP]... Narrator: IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIGHTING IRISH ARE OUT OF LUCK. AH, HERE COMES MY [BLEEP] DAD NOW. I DON'T NEED THIS [BLEEP]. HEY, BOYS. WE JUST PUT A NEW PUMP SEAL ON YESTERDAY, AND I THINK WE BLEW IT ALREADY. SOMEBODY [BLEEP] SOLD ME A PIECE OF [BLEEP] ENGINE. I GOT THE SAME DEAL ON MY [BLEEP] DREDGE TOO, MAN. SOME GUY [BLEEP] ME, TOO. I WANT MY MONEY BACK FROM YOU, YOU [BLEEP]. [ LAUGHS ] MY DAD IS CONSTANTLY [BLEEP] TRYING TO CAUSE ME PROBLEMS. THAT'S THE ONLY PUMP SEAL IN TOWN. UH, JUST TURNED INTO A BIG CLUSTER [BLEEP] EXTREMELY FAST. AND I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN MY LUCK RIGHT NOW. PROBLEM IS WE THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING A GOOD DEAL. INSTEAD, WE JUST THREW $3,000 DOWN THE TOILET. Narrator: GETTING ANOTHER PUMP SEAL TO NOME COULD TAKE UP TO 2 WEEKS, TIME THE KELLY BROTHERS JUST DON'T HAVE. GO GET DRESSED. WE'RE DONE. I'M NOT GIVING UP. I'M NOT GIVING UP YET. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. WE JUST NEED TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE TWEAKING. [BLEEP] [BLEEP]. I'M NOT KEEPIN' DOIN' THIS [BLEEP] AND WASTIN' MY TIME. I'D SAY OUR SEASON'S [BLEEP] DONE. SOMETIMES, THE WEAKEST PART OF THESE GRAND PLANS THAT I HAVE IS WORKING WITH MY BROTHER. HE DOESN'T REALLY GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE. DON'T RAISE YOUR [BLEEP] VOICE TO ME. HAVE A... IT'S ON THE ROPE YOU'RE SITTING ON. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING -- YOU CAN'T [BLEEP] LEAVE THAT ALONE FOR 2 [BLEEP] MINUTES! WHO CARES? OH, FINE. YEAH. WHO CARES? I'LL DO IT MYSELF, YOU [BLEEP] IDIOT. "OKAY." "OKAY." IT'S ALWAYS A ONE-MAN JOB. I SHOULD'VE NOT WORKED WITH ANY OF MY FAMILY. IT WAS BAD NEWS WORKIN' WITH MY DAD. IT'S BAD NEWS WORKIN' WITH MY BROTHER. NOBODY GIVES A [BLEEP] ABOUT DOING ANYTHING. THEY DON'T WANNA PUT... I'M JUST SICK OF IT. I'M IN A WHINY MOOD. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT. Narrator: 100 MILES TO THE EAST... MOOSE. KONA WANTS TO GO AFTER THAT MOOSE. I AIN'T GONNA LET HER. BEHAVE, KONA. Narrator: SHAWN POMRENKE IS 15 MILES INTO HIS JOURNEY FOR FUEL. LOOKIN' FOR THE TRAIL. IT'S BEEN ABOUT 15 YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN BACK HERE. I CAN'T FIND IT. IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER WHICH WAY THE TRAIL GOES. Narrator: FINDING A TRAIL THIS DEEP IN THE BACKCOUNTRY IS DISORIENTING AT BEST. FROM WHERE WE'RE AT AT BLUFF, GO OUT INTO THIS VILLAGE. THERE AIN'T NO DAMN HIGHWAY GOIN' THERE. THERE IS TRAILS IN BETWEEN THE VILLAGES. SO I GOT A GOOD IDEA OF WHERE THE TRAIL'S AT. AND HOPEFULLY, I MAKE IT THERE. Narrator: AT NIGHT, TEMPERATURES IN THE BUSH CAN DROP TO NEGATIVE 40. WITH JUST 6 HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT, MAKING GOOD TIME IS CRITICAL. WHERE IN THE HELL DID THE TRAIL GO? IT'S NOT LOOKIN' GOOD. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN HUNTS DOWN A PATH, BACK AT THE BLUFF... [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] ...HIS CREW IS STILL HUNTING GOLD. IS IT THE TOP BUTTON? IT'S OUR FIRST TIME TRYIN' TO USE THE GoPro TO GET A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM. THE BLUFFS ARE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE THAN ANYTHING YOU SEE AROUND NOME. IF WE'RE NOT MININ', WE GOTTA FIND SOMETHIN' ELSE TO DO TO KEEP US BUSY. SO JACOB AND I ARE GONNA, YOU KNOW, KEEP -- KEEP AT IT AND KEEP LOOKIN' UNDER THE ICE WITH CAMERAS AND CHECKIN' OUT NEW SPOTS. WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR A CERTAIN DEPTH OF WATER, TRY TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THE OCEAN FLOOR IS DOIN' AROUND HERE. Narrator: THE MISSION IS TO FIND A LARGE SWATH OF ROCK AND COBBLE AMONGST THE SAND, WHICH OFTEN ACTS AS A NATURAL UNDERWATER TRAP FOR COARSE GOLD. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO A COUPLE MORE, HUH? [ MACHINE WHIRRING ] AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR DIVE TENT AND GOT A LITTLE COMPUTER WE CAN PLUG THIS INTO AND TAKE A LOOK-SEE. HOPIN' THAT SHAWN MAKES IT BACK TONIGHT WITH FUEL AND DOESN'T GET STUCK OUT IN THE COUNTRY. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: AS FOR THEIR FEARLESS LEADER... KONA, LET'S GO. THERE'S A MOOSE DOWN THERE. Narrator: SHAWN'S MISSION IS TAKING A BIT OF A DOGLEG. KONA, COME ON! LET'S GO. COME ON. KONA, GET OVER HERE! COME HERE! HEY! GET BACK HERE! LET'S GO. [ THUDDING ] KONA. I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO TIE HER UP UNTIL WE GET A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AWAY FROM THIS MOOSE. HEY! HEY! SHE WANTS TO GO KILL SOME FOOD. [ CLAPPING ] COME HERE. LET'S GO. COME ON. YEAH, YOU'RE WORKIN' HARD, AREN'T YA? COME ON. HERE. YOU CAN RIDE UP HERE NOW. HERE. LET'S GET OUTTA HERE. EVERYTHING TAKES ABOUT THREE TIMES LONGER TO DO OUT HERE. HERE'S THE WINTER TRAIL. FOUND IT. CLIMB A BANK. WHOA! YEAH. MADE IT. WHOO. Narrator: 100 MILES WEST... ON CLAIM 14... WHAT KIND OF BOTTOM ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT NOW? THERE ARE SOME BIG ROCKS DOWN HERE. AND THE GLOW STICK JUST WENT IN AGAIN. Narrator: CLARK GREENHORN SHELBY JOHNSON HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE GLOW STICK PATH FOR 3 HOURS. Emily: FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE, MAN, AND JUST THINK ABOUT THE GOLD IN THE HOSE. [ LAUGHS ] SHELBY'S TINY. SHE'S, LIKE, 5-FOOT-3 OR SOMETHING. BUT SHE'S A BULLDOG. I CAN DEFINITELY SEE WHY YOU GET TIRED IN A COUPLE HOURS. THIS IS DREDGING 101 FOR YOU. OH, THIS IS FANTASTIC. I'M A GOLD DREDGER! OH. IT'S TUGGIN' ME. ONE THING TO WATCH OUT FOR IS THOSE ICE CUBES THAT WERE PUSHED DOWN FROM THE DIVE HOLE, UH, YOUR UMBILICALS KINDA GET WRAPPED AROUND THEM. OKAY. MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET IT OFF OF THAT ICE BLOCK AND THEN YOU PULL IT OUT OF THAT JET WHERE IT'S STUCK. I'LL TRY IT. OKAY. IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD COME UP AND HOLD ONTO THE SURFACE, AND WE'LL TRY TO UNTANGLE IT FROM THERE? I COULD CHECK IT OUT. OKAY. OH, MY GOD! [ BLEEPS ] WHAT'S GOIN' ON? WHAT'S GOIN' ON? ♪ Narrator: 1 MILE EAST OF NOME HARBOR... AT THE CLARK... OKAY. Narrator: GREENHORN SHELBY JOHNSON'S UMBILICAL TETHER HAS BECOME SNARED ON AN ICE BLOCK. NOW JUST PULL IT UP TO THAT POINT. [ BLEEPS ] WHAT'S GOIN' ON? WHAT'S GOIN' ON? [ BLEEP ] STOP. STOP PULLIN' IT. STOP. ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU OKAY? OKAY. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU HAD MY FACE MASK RIGHT THERE. YOU WERE TUGGING. I'M SORRY. YOU SAID -- YOU SAID TO PULL IT UP AND IT WAS HELPING UNTANGLE IT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEAR, LIKE, A -- JUST SCREAMING, AND THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT'S, LIKE, RIGHT UNDER THE -- THE SURFACE. AND I GO OUT, AND PEOPLE ARE, LIKE, YANKING ON A TETHER OR SOMETHING [BLEEP] [BLEEP] YOU DON'T DO. DON'T WANNA HAVE TO BE [BLEEP] WORRYIN' ABOUT PEOPLE DYIN' ON MY WATCH. YOU KNOW, I CAN CONTROL A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS ON A MINING OPERATION, BUT I CAN'T CONTROL WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUST BEIN' DUMB. AND WHEN EMILY GETS ALL EXCITED, SHE JUST KINDA GETS KINDA DUMB. MY GENERAL RULE IS TO KEEP EMILY AS FAR AWAY AS I POSSIBLY CAN FROM ANY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. I CAN'T, LIKE, CONTROL WHAT SHE DOES. AND SOMETIMES, SHE JUST [BLEEP]. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. YOU HAVE [BLEEP] ICE BLOCK TANGLING UP THE UMBILICAL, ROPE ON [BLEEP] WEIGHT TANGLING UP THE UMBILICAL, AND JEN TANGLING UP ON THE UMBILICAL. AND THEN, YOU [BLEEP] THROW IN A TOTAL MISCOMMUNICATION ON THE PHONE. I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING, "PULL UP THE UMBILICAL," AND, "IT'S HELPING ME TA -- DETANGLE IT." AND YOU WERE SAYING, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DISCONNECT WAS. THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. YEAH. YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD DO THAT. I WAS ALWAYS AGAINST THAT. I NEVER HAVE UMBILICAL CORDS... ALWAYS AGAINST, LIKE... WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT. Narrator: 78 MILES NORTHEAST... THERE'S A LOT OF SMALL VILLAGES SPREAD OUT AROUND ALASKA IF YOU KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO. Narrator: ON A QUEST FOR FUEL... HERE'S TOWN. THERE'S WHITE MOUNTAIN. Narrator: SHAWN POMRENKE IS FINALLY CLOSING IN. YOU GUYS GOT DIESEL AND GAS? MM-HMM. YOU GUYS TAKE CREDIT CARDS HERE, TOO, RIGHT? WE'RE GOOD? UH, NO. CASH 'CAUSE I CAN'T DO THE CREDIT CARD MACHINE NOW. OH, COULD I GIVE YOU THE CARD NUMBER, AND YOU CAN RUN IT FROM... YEP. YEP. OKAY. OKAY. YEP. AH, WE GOT LUCKY. WE GOT HERE RIGHT BEFORE HE LEFT. WE'RE GONNA GET AS MUCH FUEL AS WE CAN CARRY. [ TANK CLANGS ] APPRECIATE YA STAYIN' OPEN FOR ME. YOU'RE ROLLIN' INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S TOWN, AND YOU'RE BASICALLY OUT-O'-TOWNER. YOU BETTER BRING SOME GIFTS JUST TO GET ON THEIR GOOD SIDE. YOU WANT SOME CRAB? YEAH. THANK YOU. THANKS A LOT. YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD DAY. YEAH, YOU, TOO. $700 WORTH OF FUEL. NOW, WE'RE GONNA HEAD BACK TO CAMP AND, UH, GET BACK TO MININ'. Narrator: BACK OFF THE COAST OF NOME... AT THE PADDY WAGON... DUDE, EVERYTHING'S GONNA WORK OUT. UH, WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED 8 HOURS. WE NEED 2 HOURS, AND WE'RE GONNA GET A DIVER DOWN. Narrator: SHUT DOWN BY A BUSTED PUMP SEAL, KRIS KELLY HAS BEEN FORCED TO SCROUNGE UP A WHOLE NEW ENGINE. HEY, KRIS. YEAH? YOU WANNA ROUND UP A 7/16 AND -- AND A 1/2-INCH WRENCH FOR US? YEAH. OKAY. Narrator: THE PRICE TAG -- HIRING ON TWO LOCAL OUT-OF-WORK MINERS. JASON AND PHIL, THEY'VE GOT QUITE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE. BUT PARTNERSHIPS ALWAYS TURN OUT BAD, IT SEEMS LIKE, IN NOME. YOU REALLY HAVE TO REALLY WATCH WHO YOU WORK WITH. EXCEPT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE [BLEEP] ARCTIC IN THE WINTER, SO CHOICES ARE LIMITED. YEAH, ALL I CAN DO IS RUN AROUND, GET EVERYTHING SET UP, [BLEEP] HOPEFULLY, THAT PRIMA DONNA ANDY, AFTER I GET EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF, WILL COME BACK AND WORK WITH ME. Narrator: AS FOR LITTLE BROTHER... HEY, ANDY. WHAT'S UP? HEY. WHAT'S GOIN' ON? IS YOUR [BLEEP] UP AND RUNNING GOOD? IT'S -- IT'S RUNNING. I WANNA DIVE. Narrator: RATHER THAN HELP HIS BIG BROTHER, ANDY HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA. I'M TIRED OF [BLEEP] WORKING, BUILDING SHAFTS, EVERYTHING ELSE, AND I NEED TO MAKE MONEY. I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK. I WISH KRIS WOULD COME BACK, TOO, AND WE'D JUST RUN THIS FAMILY-RUN BUSINESS. I JUST WANNA DIVE AND MAKE MONEY. YOU WILL, BUDDY. YOU BRING YOUR WET SUIT? YEAH. OKAY. SUIT UP. ONCE I PULL ANDY AWAY FROM HIM, THAT'LL EAT AT THE FIBER OF KRIS' VALUES. YOU KNOW, HE NEEDS THAT SUPPORT, THAT MORAL SUPPORT, OF HIS BROTHER BEIN' RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. AND THEN, KRIS WON'T BE ABLE TO GO ON 'CAUSE HE'LL KEEP LOOKIN' OVER ACROSS AT US AND SAY, "THERE GOES MY DAD AND MY BROTHER." AND AS HE DOES THAT, DUDE, IT'LL EAT AWAY AT HIM SLOWLY. THE DREDGE ISN'T UP AND RUNNING, AND THEY'RE WASTING MY [BLEEP] TIME. SO I'M BACK OVER HERE ON THE REAPER, ABOUT TO JUMP IN THE WATER AND GO GET MY [BLEEP] MONEY. ANDY'S GOIN' AND WORKING FOR MY DAD. BASICALLY, THE PRICK ABANDONS ME WHEN I NEED HIS HELP. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ANDY'S [BLEEP] PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. I GOT ENOUGH COMPLICATION. ALL I CAN DO IS WORK, JUST KEEP WORKING. LISTEN. WHEN YOU GO DOWN THERE, I WANT YOU TO REALLY LET ME KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON DOWN THERE. ANDY LOOKS LIKE A [BLEEP] WEIRDO BY GOING BACK WITH MY DAD INSTEAD OF WORKING HARD WITH ME. HE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION FINALLY TO COME BACK ON THE REAPER, WHERE HE BELONGS. I HOPE THEY [BLEEP] FAIL. EVERYTHING'S GOOD FOR A CHANGE. WHOA! THAT COULD'VE HURT. ♪ Narrator: NEARLY 100 MILES FROM NOME... WE'RE ON THE HOME STRETCH. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. Narrator: SHAWN POMRENKE IS OUT OF THE WOODS. COME ON, TEDDY. IS THERE ANYBODY ALIVE IN THERE? HELLO? UH, WE GOT FUEL. WE'RE DIVIN' TOMORROW. I STOLE YOUR COT WHILE YOU WERE GONE. OH. AS SOON AS YOU TOOK OFF, WE JUST STARTED PUNCHIN' HOLES. WE GOT 8 OR 10 HOLES DONE. SHOW HIM THE FIFTH HOLE. OR... THIS IS THE FIFTH HOLE. Narrator: EVEN BETTER THAN BEING FULLY FUELED... THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD THERE. OH, YEAH. Narrator: THE CREW MAY HAVE FOUND A BONANZA. BIG ROCKS ACT LIKE BIG RIFFLES IN YOUR SLUICE BOX, AND THE GOLD LAYS BEHIND 'EM. JUST LOOK AT THOSE BIG ROCKS THERE. GOOD WORK, GUYS. NICE JOB. IT'S GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT BACK WITH THE FUEL. WELL, I'LL BE EXCITED TO GO DIVIN' IN THE MORNING, BOYS. LET'S GET SOME SHUT-EYE. Narrator: AS A NEW DAY DAWNS... OFF THE COAST OF NOME... LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING EMILY AND HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH HER. SHE HASN'T TALKED TO US AT ALL. Narrator: AFTER A PANICKED EMERGENCY WITH SHELBY'S DIVE MASK, EMILY HASN'T RETURNED TO THE DREDGE IN 24 HOURS, AND MINING IS AT A HALT. I CAN'T MAKE ANY EXCUSES FOR THAT GIRL. NO. I CAN'T. EMILY REALLY DOES NOT LIKE TO FACE HER OWN MISTAKES AND FACE HER OWN STUFF. I DON'T EVEN KNOW. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WOULD HAVE SUCH AN EMOTIONAL REACTION TO A NORMAL DREDGING SITUATION THAT'S SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS THAT THEY JUST RUN AWAY. HOW'S EL SLUICERONI DOIN'? GOOD. GOOD DEAL. IS THERE ANY GOLD IN THAT SLUICE BOX? UH, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT ENOUGH YET. [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ SNIFFLES ] HOW YOU DOIN' TODAY? OH, I AM FINE. HOW ARE YOU? I THINK WE DEFINITELY ALL NEED TO KIND OF CLEAR THE AIR. WE NEED TO DISCUSS SOME THINGS. I THINK THE QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S LIPS IS, WHERE DID EMILY GO? I GOT A LITTLE BIT OVERCOME WITH EMOTION, AND, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT? LIKE, I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE -- LIKE HAVING A [BLEEP] EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN IN FRONT OF Y'ALL. I NEEDED SOME TIME TO KINDA GET AWAY. THE EMOTIONAL STUFF AND, LIKE, TAKING OFF AND WHATNOT, THAT KINDA HURTS A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRUST HERE. BUT THE REACTION TO JUST GRAB AND YANK TO MY BREATHING DEVICE THAT'S ATTACHED TO MY FACE... LIKE, IF IT'S WRAPPED AROUND ICE BOX AND STUFF, YANKING THAT HARD IS NOT GONNA BREAK THE ICE BOX. IT'S GOING TO RIP OFF MY FACE. YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF RIPPING YOUR MASK OFF UNDERWATER, WHICH IS [BLEEP]. LIKE, TO SAY THAT, LIKE, I WOULD KNOWINGLY, LIKE -- LIKE, TO SAY THAT, LIKE, I WOULD KNOWINGLY, LIKE... I DIDN'T SAY THAT. PULL OFF YOUR MASK... I DID NOT SAY THAT. OR THAT I MISHANDLED THE TETHER... I DID NOT SAY THAT. I-I REALIZE...HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD -- HOLD -- HOLD THE -- HOLD THE [BLEEP] -- HOLD THE [BLEEP] ON BECAUSE THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS. I DON'T WANNA BE A PART OF THIS OPERATION ANYMORE. I JUST DON'T. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. AND IF ALL WE ARE IS ARGUING AND THEN WE STOP, WE'RE NOT EVEN MAKING GOLD. WHAT THE [BLEEP] AM I UP HERE FOR? YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU GUYS WORK THIS OUT. HAVE A GREAT SEASON. I'M OUTTA HERE. I'M LITERALLY DONE. SORRY. I HAVE TO LEAVE, TOO. I HAVE TO LEAVE IF SHELBY LEAVES. SHE'S WHO I TRUST UP TOP. Narrator: WITH TIME TICKING AWAY ON AN ALREADY SHORT ICE SEASON, WHAT STARTED AS A FIVE-PERSON TEAM IS DOWN TO JUST TWO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE GO FROM HERE, ZEKE. I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT MY MANAGERIAL SKILLS RIGHT NOW. OBVIOUSLY, YOU DID A LOT TO, LIKE, UNRAVEL, UM, LIKE, THE RESPECT THAT THEY HAVE FOR YOU. GROW UP. I CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY DO. I CAN'T CONTROL THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE. LOOK, I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD CHASE THOSE GIRLS DOWN BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THIS CRAP SET UP ON THE ICE RIGHT NOW. I, LIKE, HAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME PUT INTO IT, AND WE'RE, LIKE, ON TOP OF, LIKE, A BUNCH OF BULL. IF THE SITUATION CANNOT BE SAVED WITH THE GIRLS, THEN, LIKE, I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER PEOPLE TO DIVE WITH. Narrator: WITH ZEKE AND EMILY AT A CROSSROADS... [ MOOSE GROAN ] ON THE OTHER SIDE OF NOME HARBOR... HOW'S IT GOING? ARE YOU SEEIN' LOTS OF GOLD RIGHT NOW? Narrator: AT THE REAPER... OKAY, BROTHER. THAT'S A GOOD REPORT. 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU.
