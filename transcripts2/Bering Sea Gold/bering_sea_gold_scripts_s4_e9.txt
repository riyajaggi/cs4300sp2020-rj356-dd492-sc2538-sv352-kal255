Brad: NOW, LET'S GET OUT OF THE WAY SO WE DON'T HAVE NO PROBLEMS. IT'S DECEIVING IN THE DARK, AND THINGS CAN HAPPEN IN A HURRY. Narrator: WITH THE MINING SEASON COMING TO A CLOSE, FOUR CREWS ARE LEAVING PORT... THEY SAY THIS IS THE LAST HOT SPOT IN TOMCOD, SO WE JUST GOT TO GO BACK AND TRY AND CLEAN UP RIGHT NOW. Narrator: ...AND HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SHOWDOWN. IT'S A RACE TO SEE WHO CAN GET OUT ONTO THE TOMCOD FIRST AND GET THE LAST OF THE GOLD THAT'S LEFT THERE. Narrator: AFTER A SUMMER OF BEING WORKED BY DOZENS OF DREDGES, FEAR HAS SPREAD THAT THE TINY TOMCOD CLAIM IS RUNNING DRY. THE EASY GOLD IS GONE FROM TOMCOD. NOW IT'S GETTING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND GOLD. RUNNING OUT OF TIME HERE. THIS MIGHT BE OUR LAST SHOT AT IT. Narrator: NOW THE WILD RANGER, CHRISTINE ROSE, AND REAPER ARE ALL STEAMING WEST, LOOKING TO SCOOP UP THE LAST OF THE GOLD. BUT THE FIRST ONE TO ARRIVE -- GONNA HIT THIS CREEK BED WE'VE BEEN ON, SO I GOT TO GET SET UP BEFORE SHAWN GETS HERE. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: ...CAPTAIN HANK SCHIMSCHAT IN THE 80-FOOT AU GRABBER. Hank: TOMCOD'S GETTING DUG OUT, BUT I'VE BEEN ON ONE SPOT ALL SUMMER, AND IT'S BEEN REAL GOOD FOR ME. I THINK THE WORLD GOT OUT THAT I WAS GETTING ON PRETTY GOOD GOLD. Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO... Hank: WHAT'S THE TALLY ON THAT? 109.01! 109... ALL RIGHT! Narrator: ...HANK PULLED A PERSONAL BEST -- 131 GRAND IN GOLD FROM THIS SMALL SECTION OF THE CLAIM. THAT'S THE BEST CLEANUP I'VE HAD -- EVER HAD, I THINK. TODAY... SO, WE'RE THE FIRST ONE ON TOMCOD, HUH? LOOK AT ALL THOSE BOATS COMING. ...HE'LL HAVE TO FIGHT TO KEEP IT TO HIMSELF. Hank: I DON'T OWN THE CLAIM. THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE THERE, TOO, BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA START TAKING DIRT OUT OF MY BUCKET, THERE'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM. Narrator: IF THERE'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM, ONE THING'S FOR SURE -- CHRISTINE ROSE IS COMING UP QUICK BEHIND US. WE GOT TO GET IN POSITION BEFORE THEM. ...THE FIGHTING KELLYS ARE GONNA BE INVOLVED. WE'RE GONNA SIT RIGHT NEXT TO HANK, AND WE'LL JUST DROP IN RIGHT BEHIND HIM, AND WE'LL SUCK ALL THE GOLD ON BOTH SIDES. AS HE DIGS, WE'LL SUCK. CAPTAIN BRAD KELLY HAS SOME EXPERIENCE WITH SUCKING. SO FAR, THIS SUMMER... WHOO! ♪ GOLD, GOLD, GOLD COME TO ME ♪ Narrator: ...HE'S SUCKED GOLD RIGHT OUT OF HIS SON'S POCKETS... ♪ GOLD! ♪ IN MY POCKET Narrator: ...AND GENERALLY JUST DROVE HIS BOYS BERSERK. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? [ LAUGHS ] TODAY... I'VE BEEN WATCHING HANK DIG. HE DOES THIS RAKING ACTION. HE'S ACTUALLY PUTTING THE GOLD TO BOTH SIDES OF THE BOAT. WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN UNDERNEATH THE WATER. WE'RE GONNA WORK HIS TRENCHES, AND WE'RE GONNA GET ALL HIS GOLD. WITH JUST 12.9 OUNCES, WORTH BARELY 16,000 BUCKS, ON THE SUMMER, BRAD'S KID GLOVES ARE COMING OFF. I'LL TELL YOU -- IF HE'S DOING 50-OUNCE CLEANOUTS, WE'RE GONNA GET A [BLEEP] 10-, 15-OUNCE CLEANOUT OUT OF THIS WORKING HIS WALLS. Brad: I'M LOOKING TO GET A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF THIS. I'M NOT DOING THIS [BLEEP] FOR THE GOOD OF MY HEALTH. PEOPLE THAT REALLY DON'T MATTER -- I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] WHAT MY REPUTATION IS WITH THEM. IF THEY GOT A WORD OR PROBLEM WITH ME, COME AND TELL ME TO MY FACE. THEN WE'LL DEAL WITH IT PERSONALLY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S NOT HIS GOLD. IT'S NOT ANYBODY'S GOLD TILL IT'S IN THE POT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [BLEEP] IT. [ MOTOR SPUTTERS ] OH [BLEEP] THE MOTOR JUST WENT OUT. HANG ON. ANDY, YOU FILLED UP THE TANK, DIDN'T YOU? THAT WAS YOUR JOB. EVERYBODY'S GONNA PASS US. YEAH, THE CHRISTINE ROSE IS COMING UP ON US. BASTARDS. WONDER IF THEY'LL PULL IN AND TRY AND HELP US. THEY MIGHT HELP US. I WOULDN'T BET THE FARM ON IT, THOUGH. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING LEAKING. Narrator: WHILE THE KELLYS ARE STUCK IN PLACE WITH A MISFIRING OUTBOARD, NEXT IN LINE... Shawn: EVERYBODY'S HEADING OUT TO THE TOMCOD, RACING OUT. Narrator: ...MR. GOLD HIMSELF, CAPTAIN SHAWN POMRENKE, IN THE 80-FOOT CHRISTINE ROSE. LOOKS LIKE THE KELLYS ARE BROKE DOWN. ALL THESE LITTLE SUCTION DREDGES AND HANK AIN'T GONNA SLOW ME DOWN. Narrator: THIS SUMMER... THAT'S HOW WE DO IT ON THE CHRISTINE ROSE RIGHT THERE, BUDDY. ...SHAWN HAS LEFT EVERYONE IN THE DUST, BRINGING IN 827 OUNCES, WORTH NEARLY A MILLION BUCKS... [ Laughing ] WHOA-OH! LOOK AT THAT. ...WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THEIR FIRST EVER 1,000-OUNCE SUMMER. YEAH! Shawn: IT AIN'T EVEN COMPETITION ANYMORE. IT'S KIND OF FUNNY. IT'S LIKE CHILD'S PLAY. YOU HAVE THESE BIG CLEANUPS, BIG CLEANUPS. IT'S HARD TO GET EXCITED OVER IT, BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN GO OUT AND DO $250,000 IN A WEEK? NOT MANY. MR. GOLD CAN. Narrator: OF COURSE, MR. GOLD DIDN'T GET TO THE TOP OF THE LEADERBOARD... Shawn: HEY, JACOB, WHY DON'T YOU GET THAT POTATO GUN READY TO GO? Narrator: ...BY PLAYING NICE. IT LOOKS LIKE THE KELLYS ARE SITTING DUCKS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE FUN, FIRE OFF SOME WARNING SHOTS. THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE. HE'S ASKING FOR IT. Narrator: GUNNING TO KEEP THE REAPER OFF HIS GOLD, SHAWN LAUNCHES -- LET'S CALL IT... RIGHT BETWEEN BRAD'S EYES. ...A SPUD MISSILE. ARE THEY [BLEEP] SHOOTING AT US? Andy: [ Laughing ] YEAH. THAT'S IT. KICK A MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN, HUH? [ MOTOR SPUTTERS ] [ LAUGHS ] [BLEEP] [ MOTOR SPUTTERS ] DIRECT HIT! DIRECT HIT! YEAH! THIS MOTHER[BLEEP] GONNA PAY NOW. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU TRY TO GET MY GOLD FROM THE TOMCOD. [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] [ THUD ] DIRECT HIT! DIRECT HIT! [BLEEP] PUNK. [ MOTOR SPUTTERS ] Narrator: WHILE SHAWN'S MAKING MASHED POTATOES OUT OF THE KELLYS... [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] [ LAUGHS ] ...BRINGING UP THE REAR... WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOING, MAN? Narrator: ...CAPTAIN VERNON ADKISON IN THE WILD RANGER. REAPER, REAPER. WHAT'S HAPPENING, BRAD? [BLEEP] JOHN, HE'S [BLEEP] SHOOTING AT OUR CABIN AND EVERYTHING. YEAH, YEAH, I HEAR YOU. YEAH, THINGS ARE GETTING KIND OF NUTTY OUT HERE. LOOKS LIKE WE GOT THE WILD RANGER COMING. I'M GONNA HAVE TO GRAB ANOTHER [BLEEP] AND LOAD THIS THING UP AGAIN. Vernon: NOW, HERE'S THIS BOAT DEAD IN THE WATER, DEFENSELESS, THEIR OUTBOARD IS NOT WORKING, AND THERE'S THE CHRISTINE ROSE MOVING OVER THERE TO JACK WITH THEM. THEY'RE LIKE A BIG BULLY IN THE BERING SEA. Narrator: VERNON ALREADY HAS A SCORE TO SETTLE WITH MR. GOLD. Vernon: WE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE CHRISTINE ROSE. THEY'VE GOTTEN RIGHT UP NEXT TO OUR DREDGE. Narrator: LAST TRIP... WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOIN'? ...SHAWN SET UP THE ROSE JUST UP CURRENT FROM THE WILD RANGER... I'M JUST GOING TO BACK THE END OF MY SLUICE BOX UP RIGHT TO 'EM, DROP MY SPUDS, AND START DIGGIN'. Narrator: ...CUTTING OFF VISIBILITY TO VERN'S DIVER... AND FORCING HIM OFF THE CLAIM. THEIR DIVER CAME UP BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SEE A DAMN THING. [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW WHY. Narrator: NOW... WE WERE DEFENSELESS BEFORE. WE'RE NOT DEFENSELESS ANYMORE. Narrator: ...IT'S PAYBACK TIME. THEY'RE OVER THERE MESSING WITH THE REAPER FOR APPARENT GOOD REASON. AND JUST LET THEM KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR,. SHAWN -- I'VE HEARD HE'S HAD A POTATO GUN. I HAPPENED TO HAVE BROUGHT ONE TO BE SAFE. THE BATTLE'S ON, DUDE. GAME ON. WELL, I'M GONNA TRUCK THEM. FIRE AWAY. NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE -- [ THUD ] OH! Man: YOU GOT THEM. [ Chuckling ] I KNOW. I NAILED THEIR SPUD. THE WILD RANGER JUST SHOT US WITH A POTATO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE HERE. [ THUD ] WELL, I THINK THE WILD RANGER JUST FIRED ON US FIRST, SO NOW IT'S TIME FOR PAYBACK. [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] [ THUD ] DAMN. [ Chuckling ] THAT NAILED THEM, DUDE. GETTING VICIOUS OVER THERE. AT LEAST THEY'RE STAYING AWAY FROM ME. THEY'RE OVER THERE FIGHTING LIKE CATS AND DOGS, AND I'M OVER HERE MAKING MONEY. WELL, I THINK THEY'RE COMING UP ON OUR STARBOARD SIDE -- PORT SIDE. [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] WHOA! IT [BLEEP] DRILLED THE SIDE OF THEIR BOAT. AAH! [ LAUGHS ] PEGGED 'EM! [ THUD ] OH, I LOST MY TRIGGER. [ THUD ] AW. [BLEEP] THING. MIGHT JUST HAVE TO GET THE FIRE HOSE OUT. I GOT A PLAN. I'M ONLY GONNA OPEN THE VALVE UP A LITTLE BIT SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT ONLY SQUIRTS LIKE 20, 30 FEET. AND THEN WHEN THEY GET BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME IN CLOSE, THEN I'M GONNA GIVE HER FULL THROTTLE AND GET THEM GOOD. COME ON. GET OVER HERE, BOYS. [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] [ THUD ] OOH, YEAH! THEY DON'T STAND A CHANCE. WE GOT THE RANGE ON THEM. THEY'RE OUT THERE PISSING OVER THE SIDE WITH THEIR LITTLE WATER HOSE. [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] [ THUD ] HERE WE GO! OH! OH, LET IT RAIN! AAH! [ CHUCKLES ] OH [BLEEP] [ THUD ] COME ON, YOU [BLEEP] COME ON! WHOA! [ THUD ] I'M GONNA MAKE ANOTHER RUN. STAND BY. [ LAUGHS ] DAMN IT! UGH! Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... I'M GONNA MAKE ANOTHER RUN. STAND BY. [ SHAWN LAUGHS ] DAMN IT! UGH! WHOO [BLEEP] OH [BLEEP] HAVE WE GOT A HOLE BACK THERE? Kelsy: I SEE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HOLE, VERN. THERE AIN'T NO WATER. Narrator: ...ATTEMPTING TO SETTLE A SCORE WITH SHAWN POMRENKE... HOLY [BLEEP] HE JUST PUT A BIG HOLE IN HIS BOAT! ...CAPTAIN VERNON TOOK HIMSELF OUT INSTEAD. PART OF THEIR EXCAVATOR CRUSHED OUR PILOT HOUSE. AND THEN WE HIT. WE TOOK A LITTLE -- DINGED UP OUR HULL A LITTLE BIT. THERE'S STILL -- NO, WE'RE NOT TAKING ON WATER. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL JUST TAKE HER NICE AND STEADY. VERN HIT THE CHRISTINE ROSE DEAD ON. Brad: YEAH, VERN -- HE TRIED TO PLAY HARDBALL, DUDE. HE MEANS WELL, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] HE'S DOING, JUST LIKE DREDGING, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HEY, LOOK. WE GOT -- WE GOT WILD RANGER WAR PAINT ON OUR DREDGE. WE MIGHT JUST HAVE TO HANG THIS UP FOR A SOUVENIR. I THINK VERN NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE A BOAT. WELL, I MEAN, WE'RE STILL FLOATING, BUT PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE REPAIR JOB BACK HERE BEFORE WE START TAKING ON WATER IN THAT HULL. Narrator: WITH A HOLE IN HIS BOAT AND THE SEASON ALMOST OVER, VERNON'S KAMIKAZE ROUTINE COST HIM HIS CHANCE AT A PAYDAY. THEY DIDN'T EXPECT ME TO HAVE A BIG SQUIRT GUN. I HAD A BIG SQUIRT GUN. AND THEY GOT WET. Narrator: WHILE THE CHRISTINE ROSE HAS BEEN MAKING WAR... Hank: NO WAY. ARE YOU [BLEEP] ME? NOPE. THAT'S THE LAST PAN YOU JUST DID? YEP. ...JUST 100 FEET AWAY, CAPTAIN HANK HAS BEEN MAKING GOLD. OH, LOOK AT THAT NUGGET RIGHT THERE. [BLEEP] THAT'S SOME OF THE BEST GOLD I'VE EVER SEEN, BUDDY. THAT'S BADASS. WELL, WE DON'T EVEN NEED A PAN. I'M NOT EVEN GONNA PAN. LET'S JUST DIG. YEAH. THIS IS GONNA BE A KILLER CLEANUP RUN FOR ME. I JUST KNOW IT IS. I FEEL IT. AH. BUT, I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS MATERIAL. LOOK AT THIS MATERIAL. IT'S [BLEEP] UNBELIEVABLE. THAT'S THE STUFF YOU LOOK FOR RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OUT OF. [ LAUGHS ] OH, TODAY'S GONNA BE GOOD. Shawn: LOOKS LIKE HANK'S ON MY OLD SPOT THAT I FOUND LIKE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO. AND IT'S THE LAST OF THE GOLD ON THE TOMCOD. SO, IS IT HIS SPOT OR IS IT MY SPOT? I THINK IT'S MY SPOT. I'M GONNA GO AHEAD, MOVE RIGHT IN, START DIGGING. HERE COMES THE ROSE, RIGHT ON MY ASS. GO AHEAD AND GET READY TO FIRE UP, JACOB. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: AFTER BEATING BACK THE REAPER AND THE WILD RANGER... IT AIN'T HIS GOLD UNTIL IT'S IN HIS BOX, SO WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME OF THAT GOLD IN THE CHRISTINE ROSE BOX. Narrator: ...SHAWN SETS HIS SITES ON GROUND JUST 100 FEET FROM THE GRABBER. Hank: WELL, I HOPE HE DON'T MESS WITH ME 'CAUSE I WANT GOOD GOLD, AND THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME TO GET THIS GOLD, SO... FULL OF GOLD. OH, LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS GOLD RIGHT THERE, MISTER. Narrator: WITH THE MEGA DREDGES DIGGING SIDE BY SIDE... Brad: EVERYBODY'S HERE. WE'RE GONNA PICK THE BEST SPOT OF ALL -- RIGHT THERE NEXT TO THE GRABBER. Narrator: ...A REPAIRED OUTBOARD MOTOR HAS THE FIGHTING KELLYS UP AND READY FOR ACTION. Brad: WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE MOVING IN ON MY SPOT HERE AT TOMCOD. THERE'S LIKE ALL THESE BOATS. [ HUMMING ] UNBELIEVABLE. LOOK AT HANK, GIVING ME A DIRTY, DISGUSTING LOOK. Narrator: WHAT WAS ONCE HANK'S SECRET HOT SPOT... HEY! WE'RE HERE TO GET YOUR GOLD! I'M NOT HERE TO GET MY ASS GRABBED. ...IS RAPIDLY BECOMING A FEEDING FRENZY. SO, WE'RE GONNA GO OVER THERE. HE'S CLEANING OUT A SPOT FOR US. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND WORK RIGHT BETWEEN HIS [BLEEP] SPOTS, IF WE DON'T GET HUNG UP ON HIS ANCHOR LINE. OH, WELL. IT IS WHAT IT IS. I'M JUST GONNA CONCENTRATE ON CAPTAIN HANK GETTING GOLD, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO. I MEAN, I CAN'T CHANGE IT. Brad: WE'RE BLOCKING HANK'S PATH. WE'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS GOLD, AND WE'RE NOT [BLEEP] MOVING. I'M A LEGAL DISTANCE AWAY. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO RUN MY ASS OVER. YOU SEEING A LOT OF GOLD? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I'M ON ALL THIS [BLEEP] A LOT OF COBBLE HERE. IT'S ALL BLACK. I JUST GOT TO BYPASS IT AND KEEP SEEING WHAT'S ON THE CLAY. OKAY. I'M WATCHING HANK'S BACKHOE. IF HE COMES ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR AIR BUBBLES, I'M GONNA YANK ON THE LINE OR TELL YOU TO COME ON UP. SO, THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHERE THEY ARE OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THE KELLYS THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET ON A BIG HOLE, TOO, NOW, AND IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN. EVERYBODY HAS TO MOVE IN ON MY SECRET HOLE. TOMCOD'S GETTING STUPID. HANK DOESN'T LOOK TOO HAPPY, BUT, OH, WELL. YOU KNOW, HE'S A RICH GUY. HE CAN AFFORD IT. BOY, OH, BOY. HE STARTS TRYING TO MESS WITH ME, THE [BLEEP] IS GONNA HIT THE FAN. Narrator: AS THE WINDS OF WAR ARE BLOWING ON TOMCOD, 7 MILES TO THE EAST, ON CLAIM 14... Emily: I CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO KEEP GOING. Narrator: FAR FROM BATTLING OTHER DREDGES, CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL IS BATTLING TO STAY IN BUSINESS. DARYL AND TONY WALKED OUT OF THIS OPERATION WITH NO NOTICE, AND I BROUGHT ANOTHER VETERAN, KIND OF KNOWN GOLD DREDGER ON. Narrator: EIGHT DAYS AGO... WAIT, YOU GUYS ARE BOTH LEAVING? I'M NOT GONNA WORK FOR FREE. ...AFTER A FULL YEAR OF WORKING AS A TEAM, EMILY'S DIVERS CALLED IT QUITS, LEAVING HER HIGH AND DRY. Emily: I GAVE THOSE GUYS THE BEST DEAL IN NOME. I'VE PAID ALL THE BILLS. AND THEN THEY DID THIS TO ME. IT'S REALLY -- I JUST DON'T GET IT. IT WAS BASICALLY A "[BLEEP] YOU. "I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU, "WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO UP HERE, OR YOUR OPERATION." IT'S THE END OF THE SEASON. NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE UP AND TO TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR WHAT WE'VE LACKED ALL SEASON. NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE MONEY, AND THEY'RE JUST WALKING AWAY. Narrator: WITH ONLY 83.5 OUNCES, WORTH JUST OVER 100 GRAND, COLLECTED SO FAR... GOT TO GO NORTHWEST TO GET TO THE EXACT COORDINATE... Daryl G.: YEAH. ...WHICH IS GOOD 'CAUSE WE CAN JUST FOLLOW THE LINE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF JUST STARTING RIGHT HERE, JUST START MOPPING HOLES AND WORK OUR WAY THAT WAY? THAT'S GOOD. I'M COOL WITH THAT. ...SHE'S REACHED OUT TO VETERAN DIVER DARYL GALIPEAU TO SAVE HER SEASON. Emily: I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSED ON TRYING TO FIND SOME KIND OF FAMILY LIKE THAT UP HERE. I LOVE THAT. I'M A FAMILY-ORIENTED PERSON, AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT. I THOUGHT I HAD THAT WITH ZEKE. I DIDN'T. I THOUGHT I HAD THAT WITH MY CREW. I DON'T. SO, SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. EVEN THOUGH I DON'T CARE ABOUT DARYL GALIPEAU -- I HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM -- ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE'S A [BLEEP] GOOD GOLD MINER, AND THAT'S WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW. OKAY, COMING DOWN ON THE NOZZLE. COBBLE UNDER 10 INCHES OF SAND. OKAY, 10-4 ON THAT. HOW'S THE VISIBILITY? IT'S GREAT. DESCRIBE WHAT THE BOTTOM LOOKS LIKE. IT'S ALL ANGULAR ROCK. IT'S HELD TOGETHER WITH A CLAY. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD ON THE TOP, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A PAYING QUANTITY. WHAT ABOUT THE AREA IN GENERAL? DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S BEEN WORKED RECENTLY? NO. I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S WORKED THIS. 'CAUSE I CAN'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT GOOD UNDER THIS FAN. BUT IF YOU GRAB A HANDFUL AND JUST LOOK AT IT OUT OF THE FLOW OF THE SAND, THEN YOU MIGHT SEE SOME GOLD. YEAH, THAT'S A COOL TRICK. I HAD NO IDEA. YOU'RE OPENING MY EYES TO A WHOLE NEW LAYER OF GOLD MINING THAT I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH. THAT'S COOL. IT'S AWESOME TO HAVE AN EXPERT DOWN THERE. IT'S AWESOME TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND KNOWS WHETHER IT'LL PAY OR NOT. I'M GLAD YOU'RE ON BOARD. I'M JUST HOPING WE CAN REALLY PULL THIS SEASON OFF AND END STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. PRESSURE'S ON. COME ON, GOLD. WHERE ARE YOU? Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ON THE EROICA... Emily: HOW YOU DOING? YOU CAN'T WASTE TOO MUCH TIME ON EACH HOLE, OR YOU DON'T MAKE MUCH HEADWAY. ...DIVER DARYL GALIPEAU HAS BEEN PROSPECTING FOR OVER AN HOUR IN A FIELD OF SAND... MAN, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME GOLD HERE SOMEWHERE. ...BUT IS COMING UP BLANK. KEEP ON HUNTING. I'M UP HERE WAITING. I'M READY TO MOVE THEM OUT WHENEVER YOU WANT TO. DOWN TO A SKELETON CREW AND 67 OUNCES AWAY FROM A PROFIT, EMILY'S HOPES FOR THE SEASON ARE SLIPPING WAY. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDER BLOWS I'VE DEALT WITH UP HERE. I'M GOING OUT WITH DARYL GALIPEAU ON THE WATER FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND IT'S NOT GOING WELL. THE ODDS AGAINST THIS SEASON BEING SUCCESSFUL ARE STACKING AGAINST ME. AND I CAN'T REALLY FIGHT ANYMORE. I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING. [ GROANS ] WHAT'S MY POSITION TO THE BOAT? RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ABOUT 15 FEET WEST OF THE BOAT, SO IF YOU WANT TO GO NORTH, THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM. OKAY. I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WALK TO THE NORTH, SEE WHAT I CAN SEE. COPY THAT. FOUND A BOULDER HERE. KIND OF SEEMS STRANGE THAT THERE'D BE A BOULDER RIGHT HERE. BUT I CAN'T RESIST LOOKING AROUND IT. OH, THIS IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. NOW, THIS IS THE -- OH, YEAH. THERE IT IS. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU SEEING SOMETHING CREAMY? YEAH. IT'S -- I'M SEEING GOLD. [BLEEP] YEAH. ALL RIGHT! DARYL GALIPEAU! THERE'S HOPE AFTER ALL! I'LL PUT THE KNIVES AWAY. WOW, IT'S LOOKING FANTASTIC. I'M SEEING HUNDREDS OF PIECES AT A TIME HERE. YEAH! ALL RIGHT! THAT'S NO JOKE. YEAH, IT'S LOOKING FANTASTIC DOWN HERE. THERE -- HOORAY! THERE IS GOLD EVERYWHERE. AWESOME. AMAZING. ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE, DARYL. I'M LOVING EVERY MINUTE OF IT. HEY, WE'RE OVER AN OUNCE AN HOUR RIGHT NOW. AWESOME. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. ALL RIGHT! THAT'S AWESOME. MY BOAT'S MAKING GOLD. YEAH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. MY BOAT'S MAKING GOLD. THIS IS REALLY NICE. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT. WELL SAID, DARYL. I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF. Narrator: WHILE EMILY LOOKS FOR REDEMPTION, SEVEN MILES TO THE WEST, BACK IN THUNDERDOME... BATTLING IT OUT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE LAST LITTLE AREA WITH GOLD IN IT, AND I'M GONNA GET IT BEFORE HIM. Narrator: ...SHAWN POMRENKE IS MUSCLING IN ON HANK AND THE AU GRABBER. SO, THE WORD'S OUT. SHAWN'S GOT TO COME RIGHT IN AND DIG RIGHT ON ME LIKE THIS. IT'S JUST STUPID, THE MOST STUPIDEST THING EVER. Narrator: HANK HAS SHAWN BREATHING DOWN HIS NECK AND THE KELLY BOYS DIGGING AT HIS HEELS. Hank: ANDY, HOW'S IT GOING DOWN THERE? ARE YOU SEEING THEIR BUCKETS OR WHAT? LOOK AT THAT BASTARD HANK TRYING TO SQUEEZE IN ON US. DUDE, HE'S PULLING HIS ANCHOR UP. PUNK. I FOUND GOLD. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALREADY ON GOLD! DAD, I'M ON THE BEST GOLD I'VE EVER SEEN, MAN. [BLEEP] A! THESE GUYS ALREADY GOT A MILLION. THEY DON'T NEED IT. I NEED IT. THEY DON'T NEED IT. MY KIDS NEED IT. MY NEW BABY NEEDS IT. MY EX-WIFE MIGHT NEED A LITTLE BIT OF IT. VERY LITTLE. IF I'D HAVE DONE THIS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, I COULD HAVE ALREADY HAD OVER 100, 200 OUNCES JUST PLAYING THIS GAME, DUDE. LET OTHERS DO THE WORK, AND YOU MOP IT UP. Narrator: THE REAPER MAY BE SUCKING UP THE LEFTOVERS... CHRISTINE ROSE IS GETTING A LITTLE CLOSE TO ME. [ WHISTLES ] HERE WE GO. YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE. Narrator: ...BUT MR. GOLD IS READY FOR THE MAIN COURSE. HEY, SHAWN, YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE CLOSE, MAN. COME ON, MAN. GIVE ME SOME ROOM. I'VE BEEN DIGGING HERE 3 MONTHS, 2 1/2 MONTHS. COME ON, MAN. [BLEEP] I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY EVER DO THIS -- EVER! HERE WE GO. LOOK AT THAT. SWING RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF HIM. I DO THREE BUCKETS TO HIS ONE. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO PICK UP THE PACE IF HE WANTS TO GET THIS GOLD. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE! I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE, AND I SURE IN HELL AIN'T GONNA LOSE TO HANK. UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S IN THERE STEALING MY GOLD IS WHAT HE'S DOING. THIS IS MY GOLD. I'VE BEEN DIGGING HERE A LONG TIME. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S DOING THIS TO ME. UNBELIEVABLE. SHAWN'S BEING A BIG BULLY, A BERING SEA BULLY HERE. LET'S JUST SEE WHO THE BIG BADASS EXCAVATOR OPERATOR IS. I'LL SHOW HIM. HOLY [BLEEP] [BLEEP] HANK. PRICK. THIS IS WHAT THE ASS-GRABBER IS GOOD FOR -- A LITTLE PUSH. [BLEEP] RUN ME OFF MY CLAIM! [BLEEP] HIT THE [BLEEP] ROAD! Narrator: ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... IT'S A BATTLE FOR THE GOLD. I'M GONNA GET THE GOLD BEFORE HE GETS IT. I KNOW THAT. Narrator: AND IT'S EVERY MEGA DREDGE FOR ITSELF. Brad: HERE, LOOK AT THAT! WE'RE RIGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BASTARDS, DUDE! WE'RE GETTING WAY TOO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. GET THE HELL AWAY. I'M GONNA GET IT BEFORE YOU! HE MIGHT BE GOOD, BUT HE AIN'T AS FAST AS I AM. Hank: SHAWN WANTS TO RUN ME OFF MY CLAIM. [BLEEP] I'VE BEEN DIGGING HERE 2 1/2 MONTHS. I GUESS THE WAR'S ON. [ LAUGHS ] [BLEEP] YOU, HANK! HE WANTS TO ACT LIKE THAT, FINE. I DON'T KNOW. I JUST WANT TO GO MINING. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO. Narrator: AFTER PROVING A POINT... HE CAN DIG THE DIRT. I ALREADY GOT ALL THE GOLD OUT OF IT. NOW TIME TO CHECK THE BOX AND SEE HOW WE'RE DOING. Narrator: ...SHAWN BACKS UP TO A SAFE DISTANCE TO VIEW THE SPOILS OF WAR. BIGGEST THING I'VE LEARNED THIS YEAR IS YOU GOT TO BE THE [BLEEP] OTHERWISE, IF YOU AIN'T [BLEEP] ONCE YOU LET THEM START WALKING ON YOU, THEY'RE GONNA JUST KEEP ON WALKING. SO, DON'T LET NOBODY [BLEEP] WITH YOU. LOOKING REALLY GOOD. WASH IS TURNING YELLOW AGAIN. LOOKING GOOD. NOT BAD. WHOA. THERE'S A BIG NUGGET. [ WHISTLES ] NICE PIECE OF QUARTZ IN THERE. YOU KNOW? [BLEEP] [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] PURR. IT WAS NICE AND YELLOW. SO WE'RE GONNA KEEP ON MINING HERE. WE AIN'T GONNA GIVE UP YET. Narrator: THE CHRISTINE ROSE MAY HAVE WON SOME HARD-FOUGHT NUGGETS... [BLEEP] POMRENKE. GET READY FOR ROUND TWO! Narrator: ...BUT NOTHING IS OVER UNTIL THE FIGHTING IRISH GET IN A FEW LICKS. Brad: I'M GOING IN TO SOAK THAT [BLEEP] DIESEL MOTOR IN THE BACK. PAYBACKS ARE A BITCH, DUDE, LIKE MY KID TOLD YOU. I SEEN ALL THAT [BLEEP] SHAWN DOES. AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S ALL IN. HE CALLS THAT FUN. WELL, I CALL IT FUN, TOO, SO LET'S HAVE SOME FUN. I'M GOING UP BEHIND THEM. GET THEIR MOTORS! DAD, YOU COME -- OKAY. Narrator: PULLING HIS SON ANDY TOPSIDE... AND NOW I'M GONNA GET SOAKED BECAUSE MY DAD'S A [BLEEP] IDIOT. Narrator: ...BRAD IS HELL-BENT ON REVENGE FOR THE MORNING'S POTATO OFFENSIVE. JACOB! [ HORN HONKS ] RIGHT HERE! DOUCHE 'EM, JACOB! LET IT RAIN! [ LAUGHING ] Andy: UH, DAD, LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING, MAN. I LOVE FULL BLAST! OH [BLEEP] YEAH, MAN! YEAH! GET THEM! LET'S KEEP THEM BACK! YOU'RE [BLEEP] DEAD! TEACH THESE POMRENKE [BLEEP] I'M A REAL PIRATE! FULL SPEED AHEAD! THEY'RE [BLEEP] DRENCHING MY OUTDRIVE. BACK UP, DAD! HE'S TURNING! ONE SHOT IN HIS WINDOW IS ALL I WANT, GOD! DAD, GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE! HE'S TURNING! HEY, I GOT YOUR MOTOR ALL WET, YOU [BLEEP] [BLEEP] I HOPE WE COST HIM THAT $10,000 DIESEL. I HOPE WE ATE THAT [BLEEP] UP WITH A SALTWATER BATH! I MIGHT BE A LITTLE WET! ACTUALLY, I'M SOAKED. BUT [BLEEP] IT'S WORTH IT, DUDE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YEAH. POMRENKE DIDN'T SEE THAT [BLEEP] COMING. WE'VE HAD THE BEST DAY WE'VE HAD ALL SUMMER. WE WENT DOWN ON THE TRENCHES THAT HANK'S LEFT. HE'S DIGGING THESE PILES OF GOLD UP FOR US. IT'S THE BEST DAY. THE BOX IS JUST PAINTED WITH GOLD. WE'RE GONNA GO HOME AND CLEAN THIS OUT. IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE THE BEST CLEANOUT OF THE YEAR FOR US. GOOD THINGS ARE AHEAD. I FEEL IT, ANDY. I FEEL GOOD THINGS. Kelsy: THE POTATO GUN -- SUPER SIMPLE. THERE'S A LOT OF VERSIONS YOU CAN BUILD WITH LIKE PROPANE OR MAPP GAS OR HAIR SPRAY. [ POTATO GUN FIRES ] THEY OPTED FOR THE COMPRESSED-AIR VERSION BECAUSE WE HAVE TONS OF AIR CONNECTIONS ON BOARD. THIS ONE'S PLUMBED RIGHT INTO OUR BIG AIR COMPRESSOR SO YOU CAN JUST SHOOT ALL DAY. Vernon: I JUST HOPE WE DON'T RUN OUT OF POTATOES. BUT THE ONIONS ARE NOT FIRING AS GOOD AS THE POTATOES. [ THUD ] [ Chuckling ] THAT NAILED THEM, DUDE. Narrator: IN THE CENTER OF NOME... SUCH AN ELEGANT WAY TO SPOON GOLD. ...CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL AND HER NEW ACE DIVER ARE LOOKING FOR A LATE-SEASON COMEBACK. Emily: I THINK I GOT ONE FLOATER.
