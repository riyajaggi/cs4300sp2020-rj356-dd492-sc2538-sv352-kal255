 Zeke: LOOKING BACK ON IT, I THINK FOR A FEW YEARS THERE, I WAS LIVING HIGHLY OUT OF BALANCE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! [BLEEP] IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A [BLEEP] BITCH, GO HOME! JOHN'S DEATH, I HAD NO WAY OF BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT GRIEF WOULD ACTUALLY DO TO ME. I AM NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD, MAN. Zeke: SO, I KICKED THE WINDOW OUT OF THE COP CAR. AND I'D YELL AS LOUD AS I CAN, "AS I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH,

 Emily: ICE MINING, IT'S EXCITING. THE FACT THAT I CAN INDEPENDENTLY PURSUE GOLD IS THE KIND OF FREEDOM THAT IS SO ADDICTIVE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO STOP. Narrator: ON THE FROZEN BERING SEA, THE WINTER MINING SEASON IS IN FULL SWING. Kris: WE'RE ON A PRETTY GOOD SPOT RIGHT NOW, BUT I CAME HERE TO GET BIG GOLD. AND I STILL WANT BIG GOLD. THE KELLYS ARE CAMPED OUT OVER HERE ABOUT 100 YARDS AWAY. THEY MUST HAVE HEARD WE WERE ON GOOD GOLD. Narrator: THIS YEAR, MINERS ARE CRAMMING INTO TWO SMALL AREAS KNOWN TO BE RICH IN GOLD. Shawn: THINGS ARE GETTING TIGHT. EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO FIND THAT POT OF GOLD. FIRST TO GET THE GOLD WINS. ROLL THE DICE AND SEE WHAT THE HELL WE GOT DOWN HERE. Narrator: ON THE TOM-COT CLAIM, THE SHAMROCK, REAPER, AND WILD RANGER ARE ALL MINING WITHIN A 500-YARD AREA... THIS IS OUR GROUND, BRO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY 750 FEET AWAY. DOES THAT LOOK LIKE 750 FEET AWAY? Narrator: ...WHILE EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST, THE MISS NOMER HAS SET UP STAKE ON CLAIM 14. SO FAR, WE'RE SEEING SOME REALLY AWESOME GOLD, AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT HIGH HOPES. I HOPE TO GET AT LEAST 100 OUNCES. WE'RE ON GREAT GOLD, AND I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW THINGS ARE GOING SO FAR. Narrator: THIS SEASON, GLEN LeBARON AND PARTNER ZEKE TENHOFF HAVE RAKED IN NEARLY 15 OUNCES... WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START HERE. ...USING GLEN'S ONE-OF-A-KIND DREDGE, THE DRAGON, AND SO FAR, THEY'VE HAD THE CLAIM ALL TO THEMSELVES. BUT NOT FOR LONG. WE'VE OFFICIALLY MADE IT ONTO THE ICE. THAT'S STEP ONE. Narrator: FINALLY JOINING THE FLEET, CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL AND THE CREW OF THE EROICA. IT'S MY FIRST TIME AS AN ICE CAPTAIN, AS AN ICE-MINING-OPERATION OWNER. I'M GOING WITH A MORE ADVANCED SYSTEM. Narrator: THE ROOKIE ICE SKIPPER WENT DEEP IN DEBT TO BUY NEW TOP-OF-THE-LINE EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING AN INSULATED MODULAR SHELTER. Emily: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. WE'RE GONNA GET 60 OUNCES UP IN THIS BITCH. LET'S GET ON DOWN TO 14 AND GET SOME GOLD! Narrator: NOW SHE'S HEADED FOR A SPOT JUST 275 YARDS AWAY FROM THE MISS NOMER. IT LOOKS LIKE A TRAILER PARK COOLER. THERE ARE 100 PEOPLE HERE WATCHING TO SEE IF I'LL FAIL. I DON'T CARE ANYMORE WHATEVER OPINIONS ARE BEING VOICED ABOUT MY OPERATION. EMILY'S CERTAINLY NOT ANY COMPETITION. GENERALLY, SHE JUST FINDS WHATEVER MEN IN TOWN SHE CAN TO BASICALLY MAKE HER MINING OPERATION FUNCTION. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE COMPETENCE TO ACTUALLY FIND GOLD ON HER OWN. I'M GONNA GO TAKE A LOOK. THAT'S GOOD. Narrator: WITH NO TIME TO WASTE, EMILY AND HER CREW GET DOWN TO BUSINESS. [ DRILL WHIRRING ] ALL RIGHT, DARYL. WE HAVE WATER. HELLO. OH! HEY, GLEN! I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU WITHOUT THE DREADLOCKS. YEAH, I CHOPPED THAT OFF AT THE END OF ICE SEASON. SO, I'M LOOKING AROUND AND SEEING ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING THINGS, PARTICULARLY THIS. Narrator: VISITING HIS NEW NEIGHBOR, GLEN GETS HIS FIRST LOOK AT EMILY'S SECRET WEAPON -- A PROTOTYPE UNDERWATER DREDGE BASED ON GLEN'S OWN DESIGN OF THE DRAGON. WE'RE CALLING IT THE DRAGON SLAYER. GIMME A BREAK. THAT'S THE MOST COMICAL NAME YOU COULD POSSIBLY COME UP WITH. IT'S NOT TO WISE TO PURPOSEFULLY MAKE ENEMIES IN NOME, BUT NAMING THE DREDGE THE DRAGON SLAYER IS JUST A, "HEY, THIS MIGHT WORK BETTER, GLEN. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?" IT LOOKS LIKE A RELIC VERSION OF MY DREDGE. GLEN DOES ALL OF HIS SLUICING UNDERWATER. WITH THE DRAGON SLAYER, WE'RE DOING A LOT OF OUR SLUICING UP TOP, AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA RECOVER GOLD MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN GLEN'S DRAGON IS. Narrator: LIKE GLEN'S DREDGE, THE DRAGON SLAYER USES A TWO-STAGE SLUICE BOX, DESIGNED TO CATCH BOTH COARSE AND FINE GOLD. THE COARSE-GOLD STAGE IS ON AN UNDERWATER STAND WITH 360-DEGREE MOBILITY. WHAT SETS THE DRAGON SLAYER APART IS THE SECOND, FINE-GOLD STAGE, LOCATED TOPSIDE. THE FIRST PROBLEM YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IS SUCTION RIGHT HERE BECAUSE THIS JET IS TOO SMALL. GOLD IS PRETTY EASY TO CATCH. IF YOU BUILD A DREDGE THAT DOESN'T HOLD GOLD, THEN, LIKE, YOU ALMOST HAVE TO TRY TO DO THAT. I THINK THAT EMILY IS RIDICULOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE WOULD NAME THIS CRUDE, LITTLE SUBMERSIBLE THING ON A STOOL THE DRAGON SLAYER. IT'S A CRUDE, LITTLE THING ON A STOOL. Emily: HEY, IT'S GONNA BE A WAR OF THE DRAGONS. [ CHUCKLES ] IT'S LIKE A DRAGON WITH A WALKER. YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN I GET A LOT OF GOLD WITH THIS BITCH, I'LL CALL YOU UP AND WE'LL HAVE A TALK. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LATER. LATER. I'M THOROUGHLY ENTERTAINED, NOT THREATENED. IT'S NOT IN THE SAME LEAGUE. THAT DREDGE OVER THERE IS NOT IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS THE DRAGON, AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE DOING TOO MUCH GOLD SLAYING OR DRAGON SLAYING. I PROMISE YOU THAT. Emily: I HAVE A SUBMERSIBLE, HE HAS ONE. LET THE BEST SUBMERSIBLE WIN. Narrator: WHILE GLEN HEADS BACK TO THE MISS NOMER, IN DOWNTOWN NOME... THANKS. ...ZEKE IS MEETING WITH HIS LAWYER, PHILLIP WEIDNER. SO I KICK THE WINDOW OUT OF THE COP CAR. THEY DRAG ME OUT OF THE COP CAR AND THEY WRESTLE ME DOWN TO THE GROUND LIKE THIS AND HOLD MY HEAD DOWN LIKE THIS. LAST SUMMER, ZEKE WAS ARRESTED ON TWO FELONY COUNTS OF CRIMINAL MISCHIEF AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN JAIL. I WANTED TO GO WAR WITH THE COPS. Zeke: WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS THAT I GO TO JAIL FOR A WHILE AND I'LL BE FELON. THAT'LL SUCK. WE'RE GONNA BE GOING BEFORE A JUDGE HERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO FOR A DISPOSITION. I'M GONNA BE ASKING THE COURT TO IMPOSE WHAT IS CALLED A SUSPENDED IMPOSITION OF SENTENCE. Narrator: ON THE ADVICE OF HIS LAWYER, ZEKE HAS PLEADED GUILTY, HOPING TO GET HIS SENTENCE REDUCED AND AVOID PRISON TIME. WE'RE KIND OF ALL SWEPT ALONG THESE STREAMS, AND IT'S JUST KIND OF INTERESTING SOMETIMES WHERE THE CURRENTS TAKE US, YOU KNOW? YEAH. IT'S LIKE, "WHOA, I DIDN'T EXPECT ALL THIS STUFF TO HAPPEN." MY LAWYER IS A VERY OLD FAMILY FRIEND, AND HE IS WELL KNOWN AS ONE OF THE BEST LAWYERS, IF NOT THE BEST LAWYER IN ALASKA. WELL, LET'S PACK IT UP AND HEAD TO THE COURTHOUSE. WHAT DO YOU SAY? ALL RIGHT. YEAH, I NEED TO GET OVER THERE. IT'S MY OPINION THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME SHOULDN'T GO TO JAIL, BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S EVERYBODY'S OPINION THAT'S IN JAIL. [ SIGHS ] Narrator: SEVEN MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOM-COT CLAIM... Shawn: FIRST HOLE'S KIND OF DEAD, SO HOPEFULLY NEXT ONE'S THE CHARM. YEAH. AFTER MOVING THE SHAMROCK 400 YARDS TO THE SOUTHEAST, SHAWN POMRENKE PREPS FOR HIS SECOND DIVE OF THE SEASON. THAT LAST HOLE LOOKED GOOD, AND IT WASN'T [BLEEP] FOR SHAWN... ...THE FIRST DIVE SITE OF THE YEAR WAS A BUST. NOPE. MR. GOLD CAN'T FIND NO GOLD! WE GOT THE LUCKY HORSESHOE THAT WAS ON THE ORIGINAL SHAMROCK. Narrator: NOW MR. GOLD HAS A PLAN TO CHANGE THEIR LUCK. IT'S A LITTLE CROOKED, A LITTLE RUSTY, BUT IT'S GOT SOME CHARACTER. IT'S ALWAYS GOT TO GO UP SO YOU CATCH YOUR LUCK. DON'T DUMP IT OUT. RIGHT THERE. MAYBE THIS IS THE TRICK RIGHT HERE. WHOO! LAST YEAR, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, BUT WE MOVE ENOUGH AND KEEP WORKING HARD ENOUGH, I KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY WE'RE GONNA GET ON IT. Narrator: SHAWN HAS DOMINATED THE SUMMER... GOLDEN PANCAKE, ANYBODY? 112. ...WITH HIS DREDGE, THE CHRISTINE ROSE... MR. GOLD SAYS, "MONEY, MONEY, MONEY." ...BUT HE'S NEVER TURNED A PROFIT WITH HIS $100,000 WINTER RIG. TO FINALLY BREAK THROUGH, HE NEEDS 150 OUNCES. Shawn: ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. [ OXYGEN TANK HISSING ] [ Singsong voice ] COME ON, BABY. COME ON. NO GOLD MEANS WE GO BROKE. Narrator: JUST 125 YARDS AWAY... ON THE REAPER... Kris: THINGS ARE GOING GOOD. I SEE GOLD. Narrator: ...DIVER KRIS KELLY HAS BEEN UNDER THE ICE FOR FIVE HOURS WITH HIS FATHER, BRAD, AND HIS BROTHER, ANDY, TENDING TOPSIDE. Brad: OUR SEASON GOAL IS 50 TO 60 OUNCES, 900 BUCKS A DAY. Narrator: THREE DAYS AGO... ...DESPITE A BROKEN COMM BOX AND SHODDY EQUIPMENT... IT'S PRETTY GHETTO. ...THE KELLYS' FIRST DIVES OF THE SEASON NETTED THEM A COOL... $10,698. Man: PERFECT. [ STATIC ] WHAT DID HE SAY? ...VERY LITTLE OF WHICH HAS BEEN PUT INTO UPGRADES. WHAT DID YOU SAY? KRIS: I can't hear you. OKAY! YEAH, SO MY BROTHER'S ON GOLD. Andy: HE CAN'T EVEN REALLY HEAR ME WHEN HE'S ON THE BOTTOM. GOT A NEW COMM BOX -- WELL, IT'S NEW TO US. MY DAD'S A CHEAP [BLEEP] SO HE GOT IT USED. WHAT THE [BLEEP] THEY WANT TO SPEND $100,000 TO MAKE $60,000, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THAT'S KIND OF WHAT BURNED US. WE GOT STILL SOME KINKS TO WORK OUT -- TYPICAL. WE GOT SPEND $10,000 AND MAKE $100,000 HERE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO. GOLD, GOLD, GOLD, YOU KNOW? WE NEED MORE GOLD. OKAY. THERE'S A SPECK RIGHT HERE, AND THERE'S A SPECK RIGHT HERE. LOOK AT THAT FLAKE. THAT'S A BIG FLAKE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX. THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE GETTING GOLD FOR SURE. Kris: "PUT IN AT LEAST FIVE HOURS STRAIGHT WITH NO [BLEEP] BREAKS AT ALL. THAT'S RIGHT, ANDY. NO BREAKS AT ALL." I'LL GO GET THE FUEL. I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR AND A HALF. HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL STAY DOWN AND KEEP DIVING, GETTING GOLD. Narrator: NEXT UP TO DIVE, THE FAMILY WORKHORSE, 32-YEAR-OLD ANDY KELLY. [ OXYGEN TANK HISSING ] HEY, IS EVERYTHING GOING GOOD? OKAY, GOOD. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. I'M GOING DEAF BECAUSE OF THE COMM BOX. MY DAD, YOU KNOW -- LIKE ANY BUSINESS, IT'S GOOD TO KEEP YOUR OVERHEAD LOW, BUT WHEN YOU START TO INTERFERE WITH OPERATIONS OF HOW THINGS GO, THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO START TO QUESTION REALLY WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE DOING. KEEP WORKING. [ THUD ] [ ENGINE SPUTTERS ] NOW! Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME, ON THE REAPER... KEEP WORKING. [ THUD ] [ ENGINE SPUTTERS ] Narrator: WITH THE AIR COMPRESSOR SHUT DOWN, DIVER ANDY KELLY HAS JUST 60 SECONDS BEFORE THE AIR IN THE LINES RUNS OUT COMPLETELY. NOW! [ OXYGEN TANK HISSING ] HEY! GEEZ! [ GRUNTS ] COME UP! THE AIR COMPRESSOR ENGINE [BLEEP] BROKE! NO WAY. YEAH! WHAT A PIECE OF [BLEEP] MOTHER[BLEEP] [BLEEP] DAMN! I JUST LEFT A [BLEEP] LITTLE MOUNTAIN OF GOLD RIGHT THERE IN THE OPEN! I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. YOUR SAFETY'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN GOLD. [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] WITHOUT A WORKING AIR COMPRESSOR... ...THE KELLY BOYS ARE OUT OF LUCK. [BLEEP] MY DAD DOES THIS KIND OF THING ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW, RUNS IT CHEAP, TRIES TO TURN A BIG PROFIT. HE'S KIND OF A REAL PIECE OF [BLEEP] IF YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU KNOW? ANOTHER DAY. Narrator: SPEAKING OF LUCK, OVER ON THE SHAMROCK... ...SHAWN POMRENKE HAS BEEN EXPLORING THE NEW GROUNDS FOR FOUR HOURS. Shawn: LOOK AT THAT CHUNK OF GOLD. WHOO! FOUND YOU. OH! [ CHUCKLES ] [ CHUCKLES ] WHOO! Narrator: SHAWN ISN'T THE ONLY ONE TO HIT PAY DIRT. JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY... THE DEPTH MAP OF THE LAST HALF HOUR WAS JUICY, JUICY. RIGHT NOW I'D BET THAT WE'RE PROBABLY CLOSE TO HALFING OUR BALANCE. 32.6. Narrator: FOR VERNON ADKISON, AFTER LOSING $1 MILLION IN JUST THREE YEARS OF MINING, HIS FIRST CLEANUP THIS WINTER HAS PUT HIM AT THE TOP OF THE LEADERBOARD. Jason: HE HIRED ME TO RUN HIS ICE OPERATION, AND HE'S SUCCEEDING FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. THAT'S LOOKING VERY JUICY. I'VE BEEN TELLING THESE GUYS FOR MONTHS WHAT WE WERE GONNA COME OUT AND HERE DO, AND HERE WE ARE. NOW VERN'S NEWLY APPOINTED CREW CHIEF, JASON WALKER, IS MAKING SURE EVERYONE KNOWS WHY. I'M VERY CONFIDENT, VERY CONFIDENT. I KNEW AS I WAS BUILDING IT, AS I WAS PUTTING IT TOGETHER. I KNOW THE PHYSICS INVOLVED IN WASHING THE GOLD AND SLUICING THE GOLD THROUGH A BOX. Spenser: YOU'RE NOT THE MOST EXPERIENCED PERSON ON THIS CREW, JASON, JUST SO YOU KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, SPENSER, WE'RE NOT GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THIS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, SIR. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS. OKAY. WHAT'S UP? OH, NOTHING, I WAS JUST TRYING TO TALK TO JASON ABOUT HOW -- ...TO REMIND ME THAT I'M NOT THE MOST EXPERIENCED PERSON. I AM THE MOST EXPERIENCED PERSON ON VERN'S CREW WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER, OKAY? I BUILT ALL THIS. HALF THIS EQUIPMENT IS MINE. THAT'S WHY I'M IN CHARGE, OKAY? WE'RE NOT GONNA DISCUSS THIS EVER AGAIN. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS. Spenser: COPY THAT. Vernon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET ON WITH THIS SHOW HERE. NO, HE'S CHALLENGING ME AT EVERY MOMENT! IT'S NOT GONNA CONTINUE! HE WANTS TO KEEP OVERRIDING AND THINK HE'S BETTER THAN ME, AND WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS! JUST QUIT BEING SO DAMN SENSITIVE, FOR GOD'S SAKES. YOU KNOW [BLEEP] QUIT BEING SO DAMN SENSITIVE. AND, SPENSER, JUST DON'T [BLEEP] TALK TO HIM. DON'T SAY A WORD TO HIM. YES, SIR. YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY, SAY IT TO ME. JASON -- IT'S ALL ABOUT, "ME, ME, ME, ME, ME." THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT. THEY'RE HARD-CHARGING YOUNG GUYS. THEY'RE FREELANCE -- THEY CAN GO SOMEPLACE ELSE AND WORK TOMORROW. Spenser: CAN'T PUT HIS MASK ON BY HIMSELF, CAN'T PUT HIS WEIGHT BELT ON BY HIMSELF, CAN'T PUT HIS GLOVES ON BY HIMSELF. HE'S A BARBIE-DOLL DREDGER. PLEASANT PERSONALITY, IT'S ICING ON THE CAKE. BEING ON THE GOLD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART TO ME. [ Chuckling ] DON'T TAKE YOUR MASK OFF. GO DOWN THERE. Vernon: WE WILL HAMMER IT. WE'LL GET EVERY SCRAP OF GOLD WE CAN GET THIS SEASON. Narrator: WHILE VERNON DOES HIS BEST TO KEEP THE PEACE, SEVEN MILES TO THE EAST, IN THE CITY OF NOME... STAYING OPTIMISTIC. IT'S HELPFUL. Narrator: ...AFTER ENTERING A GUILTY PLEA, ZEKE'S SENTENCING IS ABOUT TO BEGIN. Zeke: I'M REALLY GLAD I HAVE PHILLIP ON MY SIDE. HE'S A GREAT LAWYER AND A GREAT GUY. I HOPE I'VE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. I HOPE THAT MY LAWYER'S GONNA GET ME OFF. SOME OF MY BEHAVIOR WAS DEFINITELY OUT OF LINE, BUT THIS IS A VERY ISOLATED INCIDENT. Phillip: YOU GOT CHARGED WITH SOME VERY SERIOUS CHARGES. BEEN URGING THE JUDGE TO EXERCISE A LENIENCY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE. Narrator: ALONG WITH HIS LAWYER, ZEKE HAS THE SUPPORT OF HIS GIRLFRIEND, SARAH DUNN. HE HAS. HERE'S THE SITUATION, YOUR HONOR -- MR. TENHOFF IS A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY. I ACTUALLY HAVE KNOWN HIM SINCE HE WAS LITERALLY A BABY. HE WAS RAISED FOR MUCH OF HIS LIFE HERE IN NOME. HE'S BEEN GOLD MINING FOR YEARS HERE. YOUR HONOR, THIS ALLEGED CONDUCT WAS AN ABERRATION IN HIS BEHAVIOR. HE'S LEARNED FROM THE SITUATION. A VERY STARK MESSAGE WAS SENT. Zeke: WELL, YOUR HONOR, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I DEEPLY REGRET THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION, AND IT WAS VERY OUT OF CHARACTER FOR ME. AND I'M WORKING VERY HARD TO RESTORE MY REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND BE BACK ON TRACK. THANK YOU. Narrator: IN THE NOME COURTHOUSE... Zeke: WELL, YOUR HONOR, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I DEEPLY REGRET THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION. AND I'M WORKING VERY HARD TO BE BACK ON TRACK. THANK YOU. Phillip: ALWAYS A PLEASURE. Narrator: THE FINAL VERDICT -- ONE YEAR'S PROBATION... [ CHUCKLES ] ...AND A ONE-YEAR BAN ON DRINKING ALCOHOL. Sarah: THAT WAS GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YEAH. YEAH, SO NO BOOZE. YEAH. NO BOOZE. BUT YOU CAN GO INTO THE BARS. OKAY. OH, JOY. [ CHUCKLES ] ACTUALLY, WHY DON'T WE DO THAT RIGHT NOW? I'LL GO AHEAD HAVE A DRINK AND YOU'LL GET A 7UP. THANKS TO MY INCREDIBLE LAWYER, I GOT OFF ON JUST ABOUT ALL THE CHARGES THAT I HAD HOLDING OVER ME. I GOT A LITTLE PROBATION, AND I'D SAY THAT'S BEST-CASE SCENARIO. I MEAN, THAT'S A MILLION POUNDS OFF MY SHOULDERS. NOW I GO FULL FORCE INTO THE WORK THAT I HAVE TO DO WITHOUT THAT ADDITIONAL WEIGHT, AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE EVERY DAY EASIER FOR ME. DO YOU HAVE ANY IRISH WHISKEY? Woman: OH, YEAH, I'VE GOT SOME FOR YOU. OKAY, GREAT. I GUESS I'LL GET A DRINK. Zeke: YOU CAN GET A DRINK. YEAH, I'LL GET A DRINK. CAN I GET A STOLI AND SODA? AND COULD I GET A ROY ROGERS, PLEASE? I DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS. [ CHUCKLES ] HERE YOU GO. WELL, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. I APPRECIATE IT, PHILLIP. HEY, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH A ROY ROGERS. IT'S DELICIOUS. [ CHUCKLES ] I'M NOT USED TO BEING IN HERE AND NOT BEING SMASHED. Narrator: WHILE ZEKE CELEBRATES... ...BACK ON CLAIM 14... ...ZEKE'S MINING PARTNER, GLEN LeBARON... ...IS STILL STEWING ABOUT THE LATEST KNOCK TO HIS EGO. DO YOU THINK SHE'S TRYING TO MOCK YOU? THE DRAGON SLAYER? [BLEEP] AS GLEN KEEPS THE DRAGON ON THE GOLD, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLAIM... WE'RE FINALLY FIRED UP, READY FOR OUR FIRST BOUT OF THE SEASON. ...EMILY RIEDEL IS FINALLY READY TO TEST OUT THE DRAGON SLAYER. Emily: IF THE DRAGON SLAYER DOESN'T WORK OUT THE WAY THAT I HOPE IT DOES, WE'VE JUST WASTED A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY GETTING OUT HERE, SO HERE IT IS. Narrator: THE ROOKIE SKIPPER DROPPED 50 GRAND ON HER EQUIPMENT, GUNNING TO TAKE GLEN'S TITLE FOR THE BEST UNDERWATER DREDGE IN NOME. I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE DARTH VADER IN THERE. FIRST UP, VETERAN COMMERCIAL DIVER DARYL VALLE. ALL THE EXPENSIVE GEAR IN THE WORLD WON'T MEAN ANYTHING IF THEY DON'T LAND ON THE GOLD. Emily: THE GROUND THAT I'M WORKING ON RIGHT NOW IS THE SAME GROUND I WAS WORKING ON LAST SEASON. WE LEFT LAST SEASON ON A GREAT SPOT, AND I WANTED TO FIND THAT SAME SPOT BUT JUST WEST OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE LINE OF GOLD THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING WAS GOING. WE GOT DRAGONS TO SLAY. WE GOT DRAGONS TO SLAY. [ In pirate voice ] THERE BE DRAGONS TO BE SLAIN. HOW'S IT LOOKING DOWN THERE? WHAT KIND OF GROUND ARE YOU ON, BROTHER? ALL RIGHT! THANK [BLEEP] GOD! DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING. WHOO! Narrator: THE FIRST SIGHT IS COBBLE -- PACKED ROCK AND CLAY THAT TENDS TO TRAP GOLD. [ Laughs ] Whoo! Emily: THANK GOD WE'RE ON THE COBBLE. I WAS HAVING, LIKE, TERRIBLE FANTASIES OF JUST DROPPING DOWN ON, LIKE, EIGHT FEET OF SAND. LET'S GET SOME [BLEEP] GOLD. Daryl: ALL RIGHT. EVERYTHING LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. OH, YEAH. SHE'S COOKING NOW. LOOKS GOOD. EMILY: Daryl, the pump is fired up. Um, that sucks. You have a plug in the nozzle? WHAT'S THE WORD, BIG BIRD? WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUCTION. REALLY, IT COMES DOWN TO NOT ENOUGH POWER. THE FIRST PROBLEM YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IS SUCTION RIGHT HERE. UNFORTUNATELY, SMAUG DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. Narrator: EXACTLY AS GLEN PREDICTED, THE DRAGON SLAYER HAS A SUCTION PROBLEM. WITH THAT NOT HAVING ENOUGH POWER, ALL THE GRAVEL IS LOCKING IN THE THREE-INCH THAT'S COMING TO THE SURFACE. Narrator: RUNNING TWO SLUICE BOXES REQUIRES MORE POWER THAN EMILY'S SUCTION PUMP CAN PROVIDE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE POWER TO BLOW THE ROCKS OUT. Narrator: UNTIL THEY CAN FIX THE PROBLEM, THE DREDGE IS GROUNDED. IN ICE MINING, YOU HAVE A MONTH TO MAKE SOMETHING WORK, AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THEN YOU'RE SCREWED. THERE IS NO [BLEEP] MANUAL -- "HOW TO ICE MINE IN BERING SEA." IF THERE WAS A [BLEEP] MANUAL, I WOULD BUY IT AND I WOULD READ IT, AND THEN I WOULD KNOW MY [BLEEP] BUT NO, I JUST COME OUT HERE, AND I BUY EQUIPMENT, AND I HOPE THAT IT KIND OF WORKS AND KEEPS PEOPLE ALIVE. AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO THINGS OUT HERE. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR, AT THE WILD RANGER... ...WITH VERNON ON A SUPPLY RUN, CREW CHIEF JASON WALKER PREPS FOR HIS SECOND DIVE OF THE DAY. Spenser: HOPE HE GETS IN THE [BLEEP] HOLE QUICK. OH [BLEEP] NO, I ACTUALLY DON'T WANT HIM TO GET IN THE HOLE 'CAUSE THEN I HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIM. YOU'RE THE BEST DIVER IN THE WORLD. THE BEST DIVER IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT HIS WEIGHT BELT ON. YOU WANT MY [BLEEP] HELP, OR ARE YOU GONNA KEEP TALKING [BLEEP] IF YOU WANT MY HELP, THEN I WILL HELP YOU, BUT YOU TALK [BLEEP] TO ME LIKE THAT AGAIN, BELITTLE ME LIKE A LITTLE [BLEEP] PIECE OF [BLEEP] THEN I'M NOT GONNA [BLEEP] HELP YOU. YOU'RE NOT THE [BLEEP] BEST DREDGER IN THE [BLEEP] WORLD. YOU'RE NOT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. NOBODY'S [BLEEP] BETTER THAN ANYBODY. SO [BLEEP] REMEMBER THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE HELP? WHAT? WOULD YOU LIKE HELP? DO YOU WANT MY HELP? YES. Spenser: JASON'S PISSED ME OFF QUITE A FEW TIMES. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUST TALK [BLEEP] ABOUT EVERYBODY AND RUN YOUR MOUTH AS MUCH AS HE DOES WITHOUT PISSING PEOPLE OFF, YOU KNOW? IT EATS AT YOU AFTER A WHILE. REMEMBER WHO'S HERE HELPING YOU... ...WHEN NOBODY ELSE WILL. Jason: NOBODY CAN OUT-DREDGE ME, YOU KNOW, AND SPENSER IS A LITTLE ENVIOUS. [ OXYGEN TANK HISSING ] [ STATIC ] Spenser: THIS IS GONNA BE SUCH [BLEEP] I'M ABOUT TO TELL VERNON I DON'T WANT TO WORK HERE ANYMORE. I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] PUT UP WITH THIS BULL[BLEEP] I GOT OTHER OPTIONS, AND I DEFINITELY DON'T NEED TO PUT UP WITH [BLEEP] GETTING [BLEEP] TALKED TO ME ALL DAY AT WORK. Narrator: BACK IN TOWN... Emily: SO, WE'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING AHEAD, AND JUST EXPEDITE, JUST GO AHEAD AND ORDER, LIKE, A 10-HORSEPOWER PUMP. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ABSOLUTE SURE THAT [CHUCKLES] WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET UP AND RUNNING, YOU KNOW? ALREADY 50 GRAND IN THE HOLE FOR HER DREDGE, EMILY MUST NOW DIG A LITTLE DEEPER FOR A NEW SUCTION PUMP. LET'S JUST DO THAT. HOPEFULLY, THIS IS A [Chuckling] SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEMS. ALL RIGHT. THANKS, PAT. BYE. ALL RIGHT, DUDES. GET THAT [BLEEP] ORDERED AND ON ITS WAY TODAY. GOOD, GOOD. WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THIS THING GOING, 'CAUSE WE NEED TO. YEAH, WE DO. LET'S GET ON IT. THERE IS A TICKING CLOCK WITH ICE MINING, AND IT'S EITHER MAKE THE SUBMERSIBLE WORK OR... NOTHING. Narrator: OVER AT THE KELLY HOUSE... Brad: HOW'S IT LOOKING, CHAMP? WHOA, LOOK AT ALL THE GOLD IN THERE. HOLY [BLEEP] ...NEEDING CASH TO FIX THE AIR COMPRESSOR, THE BOYS ARE CLEANING UP WHAT LITTLE GOLD THEY HAVE. Kris: WE NEED $100,000. YOU REALLY WANT TO INVEST $100,000 INTO DREDGING? WELL, WE KIND OF NEED TO. Brad: YOU'RE BREAKING UP. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO I MEAN? I MEAN, WHAT DOES DAD REALLY DO? HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. HE'S LIKE OUR MASCOT. WE DIVE FOR THE GOLD, WE CLEAN IT. HE'S IN THE CHAIR. WHAT DOES HE DO? HE'S OUR NEW STEVE RIEDEL. I DON'T WANT EITHER OF THEM. DAD'S BRINGING DOWN OUR OPERATION WITH HIS [BLEEP] AROUND AND STARTING A NEW FAMILY, YOU KNOW? HE NEEDS TO GET HIS HEAD OUT OF HIS ASS AND GET TO WORK. Narrator: FOR KRIS AND ANDY, THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS IS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE FAMILY. MY DAD, HE MET A WAITRESS -- HAS A COUPLE KIDS, 'CAUSE SHE'S MARRIED. MY DAD'S MARRIED. AND THEY'RE HAVING A KID TOGETHER, YOU KNOW? MY MOM'S ALWAYS SUPPORTED HIM ALL OF HIS LIFE. HE JUST KICKED HER TO THE CURB. AND YOU KNOW, HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING A BUSINESS. HE'S BASICALLY LEFT THAT TO ME, AND HE'S TAKING 50% OF EVERYTHING THAT I MAKE ON TOP OF THAT, FOR HIS NEW FAMILY. Andy: MYSELF, I HAVE A LOT OF HATRED TOWARDS MY FATHER FOR THIS. HE RIPPED MY FAMILY APART FOR A STUPID, LITTLE GIRL, SO I'M ONLY UP HERE BECAUSE OF MY MOTHER. THE MAJORITY OF MY GOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT I FIND GOES TO MY MOTHER 'CAUSE NOW I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MY MOM BECAUSE MY DAD'S A PIECE OF [BLEEP] AND WANTS TO PARTY WITH A LITTLE 27-YEAR-OLD. SO... YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF HATRED IN OUR FAMILY RIGHT NOW, DUDE. YOU SHOULD SEE THE ARGUMENTS WE HAVE AT HOME. IT'S STILL THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME AHEAD OF US. EVERYTHING'S GONNA WORK OUT. NOME IS SO COLD THAT YOU HAVE TO DRESS UP LIKE AN ASTRONAUT EVERY TIME YOU GO OUTSIDE. NOME IS SO COLD THAT A BEER FREEZES BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN IT. NOME IS SO COLD THAT... NOME IS SO COLD, IT TAKES TWICE AS MUCH ENERGY TO LIVE AS ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET. NOME IS SO COLD THAT YOU BETTER HAVE A WARM GIRLFRIEND. [ CHUCKLES ] [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: IN NOME, ANOTHER THREE DAYS ON THE ICE MEANS ANOTHER CHANCE TO CLEAN UP SOME GOLD AND ANOTHER SHOT AT TURNING A PROFIT. Shawn: WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S MORE OF A STORAGE SHED THAN A CLEANUP SHACK. AT THE POMRENKE CLEANUP SHACK... I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND RUN THIS DIRT AND SEE WHAT WE GOT. Narrator: ...SHOOTING FOR A 150-OUNCE WINTER, SHAWN FIRES UP HIS WASH PLANT FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR. Shawn: THAT LAST WINTER MADE ME A LOT MORE HUNGRY. I SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY BUILDING THE DREDGE, AND I PUT A LARGE INVESTMENT INTO IT. BUT THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO IS KEEP CHASING IT DOWN. THERE AIN'T NO GUARANTEES. DON'T LOOK TOO BAD. DON'T LOOK BAD AT ALL. WE DID 10 OUNCES? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S HARD TO SAY. MORE THAN THAT. Narrator: AS SHAWN AND THE CREW LOOK TO CASH IN BIG, FIVE MILES AWAY... I'LL GO SELL GOLD RIGHT NOW AND TRY AND GET SOME MORE MONEY TO KEEP THE OPERATION RUNNING. PLUS, THE KIDS NEED A LITTLE MONEY TO GO OUT AND BUY THEIR LUNCHES. Narrator: ...BRAD KELLY IS SELLING A MUCH SMALLER HAUL. HEY, BILL. WE BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD FOR YOU. WE HAD A [BLEEP] WEEK THIS WEEK, A LOT OF BREAKDOWNS. Bill: 3.33. OKAY. WHAT'S THE COST OF GOLD TODAY? $1,303. OKAY. 80% OF THAT IS $1,042, TIMES 3.34... EQUALS...$3,480. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I WISH WE HAD THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT. YEAH, SO YOU'RE PAYING AND PAYING AND PAYING. AS OWNER, BRAD'S SHARE COMES OUT TO $1,740. EVERYBODY WANTS A CHUNK. NOW I GOT TO GO HOME, THE KIDS WANT A CHUNK. THAT'S THE WORST PART OF ALL, YOU KNOW? "HEY, DADDY..." YEAH, IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY THEM AT ALL, I'D BE LAUGHING. THERE YOU GO. WELL, GOOD LUCK OUT THERE. KEEP SAFE. ALL RIGHT. I WILL. OKAY. THANKS A LOT, BILL. 'CAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS OUT. ACROSS TOWN, OVER AT VERNON'S TRAILER... SO, I'M SATISFIED WITH MOST EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. YOU'VE PUT TOGETHER A HELL OF AN OPERATION, YOU PUT US ON THE GOLD, AND BELIEVE ME, I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. FINALLY SUCCEEDING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS, VERNON HAS CALLED A MEETING WITH HIS CREW CHIEF. I'VE GOT THE BEST TEAM THAT I'VE EVER BEEN WITH, BAR NONE. WE'RE GETTING LOTS AND LOTS OF GOLD, BUT A NEGATIVE PERSON WILL INFECT THE ENTIRE GROUP. BOTTOM LINE IS, WHAT I LIKE FOR YOU TO DO IS WORK ON YOUR PEOPLE SKILLS. THESE GUYS, WE DON'T WANT TO RUN THEM OFF. WE'VE GOT A GOOD TEAM HERE. THEY'RE YOUNG, THEY'RE AMBITIOUS, THEY'LL DO DAMN NEAR ANYTHING YOU TELL THEM IF YOU TELL THEM RIGHT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I'M NOT GONNA BE SECOND-GUESSED BY A BUNCH OF LITTLE 20-SOMETHINGS, AND THAT'S CAUSING SOME FRUSTRATION FOR ME. THEY'RE HERE AS WORKERS, EMPLOYEES TO DO A JOB, AND SOMEONE LEADING THEM. I REVERTED TO TALKING A LOT OF SMACK ABOUT HOW GOOD I AM TO GET THEM TO COMPETE WITH ME. BUT THE FACT IS, I MEAN, THIS IS THE CREW THAT WE GOT TO WORK WITH. THEY WILL NOT BE BROWBEATEN. THEY'RE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, OKAY? BUT THEY'RE INEXPERIENCED. THEY'RE NOT. SPENSER IS NOT INEXPERIENCED. SPENSER HAS NEVER RUN OR PUT TOGETHER A COMMERCIAL OPERATION. AND I WON'T ACCEPT ADVICE FROM THE SMARTEST PEOPLE, PROVEN PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMPETE WITH ME. THAT'S THE MOST IGNORANT THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE. I'M NOT PUTTING MY DESTINY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S CONTROL. AS LONG AS EVERYTHING HAS BEEN IN MY CONTROL, ALL OF MY LIFE -- WHETHER IT WAS MY TRUCKING COMPANY OR WHATEVER I DID FOR MONEY -- WHEN I WAS IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION, I ALWAYS PROSPERED, EVERY SINGLE TIME, OKAY? TWO TIMES I WORKED FOR YOU, I HAD TO STAND BACK, AND I COULDN'T SAY A WORD, AND WE FAILED. NOW, LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT US, OKAY? I ASKED YOU TO STAND BACK, AND I PROSPERED -- WE PROSPERED. I WAS ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER AN OPERATION, AND I TOLD YOU FROM THE BEGINNING WHAT WE WERE GONNA GO OUT THERE AND DO, AND WE'VE DONE IT... BECAUSE IT WAS ALL PUT IN MY POWER AND CONTROL, OKAY, AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL AND SET MY OWN DESTINY. AND I BROUGHT ALL OF YOU WITH ME. ALL RIGHT. WELL, LOOK, THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. I MEAN, I'VE SAID EVERYTHING THAT I NEED TO SAY ABOUT THIS. I'VE GOT A TEAM. I DON'T WANT THEM DRIVEN OFF, OKAY? THEY ARE HARD TO REPLACE. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS, I'M PAYING YOU AN EXTRA PERCENTAGE TO BE MY OPERATIONS MANAGER, AND PART OF THAT INCLUDES KEEPING THE CREW TOGETHER. AND I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO DO THAT, PLEASE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, GOOD. LET'S GO GET SOME PIZZA. Narrator: BACK AT THE KELLY HOUSE... Brad: I WENT TO POTTER'S, AND I SOLD THE GOLD. SO, OUT OF MY SHARE -- I TOOK 50%. I OWE YOU GUYS 1,500 BUCKS. ACTUALLY, BRAD OWES HIS SONS $1,740. OKAY, SO I'LL GIVE YOU $750. HERE'S $700. I DON'T HAVE ANY CHANGE. WHAT THE [BLEEP] Narrator: ALL TOLD, PAPA KELLY SHORTCHANGES HIS FLESH AND BLOOD 340 BUCKS. I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU LATER. IF YOU TRUST ME -- MAYBE YOU DON'T. I DON'T CARE. I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU LATER. I DON'T HAVE ANY CHANGE. $700 FOR A WEEK OF WORK UP HERE? THAT'S BULL[BLEEP] DON'T BITCH, OKAY? WORKING AT SUBWAY, I THINK YOU MAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AS I MADE THIS WEEK. HE MADE $700, FIRST OF ALL. WHO THE [BLEEP] KNOWS WHO MAKES AT SUBWAY? WHO THE [BLEEP] HAS EVER WORKED AT SUBWAY? ME. Kris: YOU WORKED AT SUBWAY? [ CHUCKLES ] WHEN I WAS 16. LET ME TELL YOU, I ATE MORE SANDWICHES THAN I SOLD. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: OUT AT THE POMRENKES'... Shawn: OH, LOOK AT THIS. THAT'S QUITE THE PILE OF GOLD. THERE'S A LOT MORE THERE THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT, THAT'S FOR DANG SURE. THERE'S SOME FINE GOLD IN THERE. IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD. LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. THAT'S A NICE PAN THERE, BUDDY. 25 OR SO? 20? WE'LL SEE WHAT IT WEIGHS. OH! 30.95, [ CHUCKLES ] 30 OUNCES, .95. Narrator: 30.95 OUNCES IS WORTH OVER $40,000... IT'S GOOD TO SEE SOMETHING COMING IN. ...AND THE SHAMROCK IS BACK IN BUSINESS. WHOO! THAT'S A GOOD START. AFTER A WEEK ON THE ICE, VERNON REMAINS AT THE TOP OF THE BOARD, BUT MR. GOLD IS RIGHT ON HIS TAIL. HERE WE GO. Man: WHOO, BABY! Emily: THAT IS ONE HELL OF A PICKER. GLEN, YOU ARE JUST SIMPLY BEING AN [BLEEP] DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO [BLEEP] SAY! YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] TALK TO YOU. [BLEEP] OFF. Man: AAH! SMASHED IT PRETTY GOOD, MAN. WHOA! OH [BLEEP]
