 AND I HAVEN'T FOUND THE TREASURE YET. I HAVEN'T FOUND THE CANYON OF GOLD. I NEED TO GET OUT THERE. I NEED TO GET AFTER IT TOUGH. Narrator: IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. YOU GOT TO STAY WITH DAD. KRIS, HE'S GOING DOWN A PATH OF DESTRUCTION. OH. READY TO GET SOME GOLD, BOY? SOME MORNING REFRESHMENT? I AM TURNING MY SEASON AROUND. I'M MY OWN CAPTAIN AGAIN. I LOVE THE ENTHUSIASM! I LOVE IT! I'VE BEEN WORKING THE WHOLE SEASON WITH MY DAD AND NOT MADE ONE [BLEEP] DIME FROM IT. Narrator: AND THE GLOVES ARE COMING OFF. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY TODAY, MAN. ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOME... LET'S GO! WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED -- PICK, SHOVEL, PANS, COUPLE BUCKETS. 62-YEAR-OLD STEVE POMRENKE IS WORKING ON HIS BUCKET LIST. IT'S TOP SECRET, DYLAN. IT'S TOP SECRET? THIS IS LIKE TOP SECRET WHERE WE'RE GOING, RIGHT? EVERYBODY HAS TO MAKE AN OATH RIGHT NOW. TOP SECRET. Narrator: ALL SUMMER LONG... ARE YOU IN -- IN ON THE INLAND LANE OR OUT? WELL, WHERE ARE WE GOING MINING? OH, I GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, KID. ...STEVE'S BEEN PUSHING HIS SON SHAWN TO HELP HIM FUND ONE LAST SHOT AT AN INLAND MINING OPERATION. THERE'S SOME GOOD GROUND. TODAY... YEAH, I GOT A COUPLE, TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT PLACES HERE I'D LIKE TO PROSPECT OUT. SO THIS IS THE PRELIMINARY RUN -- PROSPECTING RUN ON THIS PROPERTY. SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME GOLD. HELL YEAH. THE OLD MAN IS LEADING THREE GENERATIONS OF POMRENKES ON A SCOUTING TRIP TO CHECK OUT HIS CHOSEN GROUNDS. IF I GET THIS INLAND MINE SET UP, IT'LL BE A LIFELONG THING FOR OUR GRANDKIDS, TOO. THEY'LL HAVE A JOB FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS. YEAH! LOVE THE RIDE. I KEEP HEARING RUMORS ABOUT THIS GROUND OUT HERE, WHETHER IT'S PRETTY GOOD OR NOT. AND TODAY WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO FINALLY CHECK IT OUT. LOT OF PAY DIRT INLAND. IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF -- IT'S CALLED BRAIDED CHANNELS, FROM WHEN THE GLACIERS RETREATED OFF OF THIS PLAIN HERE. AS THE GLACIERS MELTED AND RECEDED, IT LEFT OUT RIVER CHANNELS. THEY -- THEY RUN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU GOT TO KNOW WHAT DIRT TO RUN AND WHAT DIRT NOT TO RUN. Narrator: IN NOME, FINDING DIRT TO RUN IS PART GEOLOGY... JUST SCOOT ALONG HERE. I DON'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT. YOU TAKE THE HIGH ROAD. I'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD. Narrator: ...AND PART DETECTIVE WORK. DO YOU SEE A BUILDING? DO YOU SEE A ROAD? DO YOU -- ONLY THING YOU SEE IS A PILE OF TAILINGS ON THE BANK OVER THERE. Narrator: TAILING PILES ARE DISCARDED DIRT MARKING GROUND ALREADY RUN BY MINERS LONG SINCE DEAD AND GONE. FOR OVER A CENTURY, THIS TUNDRA HAS BEEN WORKED BY MAN AND MACHINE ALIKE. THE OLD TIMERS GOT A LOT OF THE GOLD, BUT THEY DIDN'T GET IT ALL. THE OLD TIMERS DID ALL THE HARD WORK GOING AROUND AND FINDING IT. NOW WE JUST WANT TO SEE IF THEY LEFT ANY BEHIND FOR US. THAT WHITE MOSS, I CALL THAT MINER'S MOSS. IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST PROSPECTING FUNGI THAT YOU LOOK FOR. WHEN YOU HAVE MINERALIZED GROUND AND GOLD POPPING UP OUT OF THE GROUND, YOU HAVE MINER'S MOSS. [ ENGINE REVS ] ♪ MINER'S MOSS UP AT THE HILL ♪ LOOK AT THAT. MAN... WOW. FROM THERE TO THERE, DYLAN. DIG A HOLE. DO YOU WANT GO JUST OFF THE TOP OF ONE OF THESE TAILING PILES? SURE, RIGHT OFF THE TOP. IT'S BEEN WASHING DOWN FOR YEARS. BEACH GRAVEL, SAND GRAVEL. HERE, YOU GOT BOOTS ON? I'D SAY THERE'S WATER DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE. DON'T BE LOSING ANY. SEE ANYTHING? OH, YEAH, BABY! THAT'S A NICE LOOKIN' PAN. THAT'S A GOOD MONEYMAKER RIGHT THERE. WELL, I GUESS WE FOUND OUT WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT HERE. NOW WE'LL GO TO PRELIMINARY STEP NUMBER TWO AND GET A -- GET THE EXCAVATOR OUT HERE AND GO FROM THERE. DIG SOME HOLES, DO SOME REAL SERIOUS TEST PANNING... FOR QUANTITY AND QUALITY... AND THEN GO FROM THERE. THERE'S GOLD ALL OVER IN THESE HILLS, BUDDY. Narrator: WHILE THE POMRENKES ARE FINDING GOLD ON LAND, NINE MILES TO THE WEST ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Narrator: THEIR CHIEF RIVAL, HANK SCHIMSCHAT, IS ALREADY ON THE BERING SEA. RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA MINE RIGHT HERE. RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF THIS GUY'S CAMP. THERE'S AN OLD RIVERBED THAT COMES OUT. AND UM, IT'S, UH, A NICE BIG BOULDER HOLE OVER HERE WHERE I'VE BEEN DIGGING. THERE'S SOME ROCKS I CAN'T MOVE OUT THERE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO IS, I WANT TO DIG AROUND 'EM 'CAUSE THERE'S BIG CHUNKS OF GOLD UNDERNEATH THEM. BOULDERS AND GOLD, ALMOST LIKE A COUNTRY SONG. Narrator: WITH 224 OUNCES WORTH $290,000 COLLECTED HIS SOPHOMORE SEASON, HANK'S LOOKING TO HIS SECRET HONEY HOLE TO HELP HIM END ON A HIGH NOTE. Hank: YOU LEARN HOW TO FOLLOW THE GOLD. IT'S ANOTHER CONCEPT THAT I'VE LEARNED IN TWO YEARS. THE GOLD COMES FROM THE CREEKS, BASICALLY, AND THE GLACIERS. SO THEY RUN IN LINES. THEY MIGHT MEANDER, BUT THEY RUN IN LINES. AND SO ONCE YOU GET ON A GOOD LINE, YOU NEED TO FOLLOW IT. TIME TO GO MININ'. [ EQUIPMENT WHIRRING ] [ CLATTER ] [ THUD ] [BLEEP] ROCKS. ROCKS AND ROCKS AND ROCKS AND ROCKS. IT AIN'T EASY WORKING ON THE BERING SEA TRYING TO GET THIS GOLD, IT JUST AIN'T. PUT YOUR BUCKET DOWN, AND YOU'RE RIGHT ON TOP OF ROCKS. YOU CAN'T DIG THROUGH 'EM. YOU GOT TO SNEAK DOWN IN BETWEEN 'EM AND THEN TRY TO PULL 'EM. WHOA, YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] [ CLAPS ] LOOKIN' GOOD. SHOULD WE DO A TEST PAN? WE GOT -- [ LAUGHS ] NO WAY! I THINK YOU HIT THE MOTHER LODE, BOSS. HOLY [BLEEP]! YOU KIDDING ME? [ LAUGHS ] OH, MY GOD! OH, IT'S GOOD OUT HERE. GOOD SPOT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST TEST PAN OF THE YEAR I'VE SEEN RIGHT THERE. THAT'S AWESOME. I'M GETTING GOLD FEVER. NEVER HAD IT BEFORE, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN YOU SEE THESE KIND OF PANS, WOW! YOU GOT TO KEEP ON IT. Narrator: WHILE HANK MAKES THE MOST OF HIS SECRET SPOT, SEVEN MILES TO THE EAST, BACK ON BELMONT BEACH... LET'S GET GOING. NEWLY MINTED CAPTAIN KRIS KELLY, ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER, BOSTON DAVE, IS HEADED TO SEA... Kris: SO TODAY IS OUR MAIDEN VOYAGE TOGETHER. I KNOW FOR SURE WE'RE GONNA GET A COUPLE OUNCES. Narrator: ...ON THE 14-BY-16-FOOT LOKO. Kris: EXTREMELY SMALL SPACES. EVERYTHING IS SO COMPACT THAT YOU HAVE TO CRAWL AROUND TO DO ANYTHING ON THIS BOAT. IT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS. [ MOTOR STARTS ] LET'S ROCK AND ROLL. BUT I'D RATHER BE HERE THAN WORKING WITH MY DAD ANYMORE. Narrator: SINCE KRIS CAME TO TOWN TO DREDGE WITH HIS FAMILY, THE KELLYS' STORY HAS BECOME A RAMBLING TALE. READY? HERE WE GO. I HOPE YOU AND MY BROTHER LIVE GREAT. YUP. ANYTIME. HIS LITTLE BROTHER QUIT. [ LAUGHING ] HIS DAD DROVE HIM NUTS. I JUST HATE THIS TOWN. Narrator: HIS LITTLE BROTHER CAME BACK. DAMN. SHE'S SO SMALL, SHE'D FIT UP A SUCTION HOSE. Narrator: HIS DAD BABY WITH A WOMAN WHO WASN'T HIS MOM. MY LITTLE PUMPKIN-HEAD. I QUIT THIS BOAT RIGHT NOW! Narrator: KRIS QUIT. TEN GRAND BUYS YOU HALF THE LOKO. I THINK IT MIGHT WORK, DUDE. Narrator: THEN, KRIS BOUGHT INTO A NEW DREDGE. ANOTHER GOOD INVESTMENT BY KRIS KELLY. Narrator: OKAY? ALL RIGHT. Kris: IT GOES ON AND ON HOW MANY TIMES I'M SCREWED BY MY DAD IN ONE SEASON. IT'S DISGUSTING. IT'S ABOUT TIME I ACTUALLY START TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. IF I CAN MAKE GOLD ON THAT BOAT, I CAN MAKE GOLD ON ANY BOAT. YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO PROVE TO MYSELF, IS THAT I CAN DO IT NO MATTER WHAT. SO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING DOWN TO A PLACE CALLED STATE LAND. THAT MEANS ANYBODY CAN WORK THERE WITH AN 18-HORSEPOWER. AND WE'RE GOING THERE. WE'RE GOING TO WORK IT HARD. WE'RE GOING TO KILL IT, BRO! KILL IT TODAY. KILL IT! I WANT SOME GOLD IN THAT BOX. I GOT A CHERRY LITTLE SPOT TO WORK TODAY. I'M RELYING ON, UH, KRIS TO GET SOME BIG GOLD. [ CHAIN RATTLES, SPLASH ] THROW IT. AND THAT'S IT. IT'S ANCHORED. THREE OUNCES IS MY GOAL TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW IT WORKS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S CRANK IT UP. [ MOTOR STARTS, RUMBLING ] [ AIR HISSING ] HOW'S IT LOOK DOWN THERE? IT'S, UH... THREE -- THREE TO FOUR FEET OF VISIBILITY. HOW'S THE COBBLE LOOK? HAS IT BEEN HIT? YEAH, THE COBBLE HAS BEEN HIT PRETTY HARD, BUT I'M GOING TO GO IN BETWEEN PLACES... ALL RIGHT. COOL, MAN. DON'T WORRY, MAN. WE'RE GONNA GET SOME GOLD TODAY.

I CAN'T REALLY TELL HOW MUCH IT IS 'CAUSE IT'S REAL CLOUDY DOWN HERE. That's all right. That's all right. I KNOW THIS AREA. IF YOU'RE SEEING IT RIGHT NOW AND IT'S CLOUDY, WE'RE ON HALF OUNCE, THREE QUARTERS OF AN OUNCE AN HOUR. I GOT TO CLEAN UP THIS GOLD ALL OVER THE CLAY RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE GAME CHANGER RIGHT HERE, BRO. THE GAME CHANGER! IT'S NICE TO WORK WITH SOMEONE THAT I'M NOT ARGUING WITH ALL DAY LONG. YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN, IF YOU JUST GOT A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD, IT'S MORE GOLD THAN BRAD'S GETTING TODAY. [ LAUGHS ] OH, I'M SEEING SOME CHUNKY GOLD NOW. WE'RE IN THE MONEY, BABY. NICE! NICE! [ AIR HISSES ] [ CLATTER ] YO? [ SHALLOW GASPING ] You all right? Hey! Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME... [ RADIO CRACKLING ] [ SHALLOW GASPING ] YO? [ SHALLOW GASPING ] You all right? Hey!

I TRIED TO SWIM WITH MY WEIGHT BELT ON. YEAH, I WAS SEEING YOU POPPIN' UP AND DOWN THERE. THAT WAS CLOSE. THIS IS MY PROBLEM RIGHT HERE. SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THAT, BAM, AND YOU'RE DEAD. UM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I GUESS IT GOT BUMPED, AND IT [BLEEP] POPPED OFF. BUT LOOK AT THAT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO... [ POP ] IS TOUCH THAT, AND BAM. WE HAVE A RESERVE AIR TANK, WHICH WILL GIVE YOU FIVE TO 10 MINUTES OF AIR, EASY. BUT WHEN YOU POP THIS THING OFF, YOU HAVE ZERO AIR, LIKE ONE BREATH. MAN! DAVE, THANK YOU FOR, UH, FOR -- FOR I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. BUT THAT'S FINE. AT LEAST YOU WERE HERE. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA FIX THAT REAL QUICK. YEAH, DUDE, FIX IT. THAT'S OFF. LET'S FIX THAT. HEY, THERE'S GOLD HERE THOUGH. YEAH. THERE'S GOLD HERE. IT'S LIKE SIX INCHES DOWN. IT'S RIGHT ON THIS FALSE CLAY LAYER, AND THERE'S GOLD RIGHT ON IT.

THIS IS SMOKIN' HOT. DUDE, FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON, WE GOT TO KILL IT OUT HERE. MY DAD WILL NEVER SEE WHAT ONCE-AN-HOUR MATERIAL LOOKS LIKE UNTIL HE GETS OFF THAT [BLEEP] REC AREA. [ DAVE LAUGHS ] Narrator: SPEAKING OF HIS DAD AND THAT REC AREA, THREE MILES TO THE WEST... KRIS, I'M GOING TO USE HIM AS A [BLEEP] STOOL TO STEP ON AS I CLIMB OVER HIM, BRO. THAT'S WHERE HE'S GOING. YOU DON'T [BLEEP] YOUR FAMILY. YOU DON'T [BLEEP] WHERE YOU EAT. AND KRIS IS [BLEEP] WHERE WE EAT, AND I DON'T LIKE IT. [BLEEP] HIM. [ MOTOR RUMBLING ] HE NEEDS TO COME AND GET BACK ON BOARD AND GET HIS [BLEEP] LAZY ASS DOWN THERE AND GET ME 50% OF MY [BLEEP] GOLD! YOU KNOW I GOT THE BRONCHITIS RIGHT NOW. AS SOON AS I KICK THIS [BLEEP] OUT, [BLEEP] KRIS. I'LL DIVE AGAINST THAT LITTLE SKINNY PRICK ANY DAY. HEY, ANDY, CAN YOU SEE YOUR OLD HOLE WHERE WE'RE GETTING THAT GOOD GOLD? [ AIR HISSING ] I'M JUST GOING TO POP A HOLE RIGHT HERE AND SEE WHAT THERE IS. [ Air hissing ] OKAY, WELL HOPE TO GOD YOU FIND GOLD RIGHT HERE. I HAD TO, UH... I HAD TO GIVE ANDY A HIGHER PERCENTAGE TO BRING HIM BACK. AND NOW, I'M GETTING [BLEEP]. I'M PAYING ALL THE FUEL, EVERYTHING. HEY... OKAY. Narrator: HIS FIRSTBORN MAY BE OUT OF REACH ON THE LOKO... ANDY GETS IN A JAM. HE WANTS ME TO IDLE DOWN. IT GIVES ME A QUICK SECOND TO DIP THIS SNIFFER BOTTLE INTO THE SLUICE AND GET A LITTLE PAYDAY. Narrator: BUT FEAR NOT. BRAD HAS ANOTHER SON HE CAN STILL RIP OFF. [ MOTOR IDLING ] LUCKY SPOT, WHERE ARE YOU? THERE YOU ARE! [ AIR HISSING ] WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW HE'S ON GOLD. TURN IT UP. I GOT TO IDLE IT BACK UP BEFORE HE FINDS OUT. [ MOTOR RUMBLING ] THANK YOU. EVERY TIME I DO THAT, IT COULD BE 200 BUCKS OR 100 BUCKS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BAM, DO THAT 10 TIMES A DAY, THERE'S A GRAND. ARE YOU SEEING ANY GOLD, THOUGH, A.? Well, that's -- [ GASPS ] LEAVE IT IDLED DOWN. HOLD ON. IT'S ANOTHER GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO, UH, TO SAMPLE THE BOX AND CHECK OUT AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. [ MOTOR IDLING ] WHOO! ♪ GOLD, GOLD, GOLD COME TO ME ♪ [ AIR HISSING ] ARE YOU READY TO IDLE UP?

BACK UP. [ MOTOR RUMBLING ] YEAH, IT'S GETTING -- HOLY [BLEEP]. I'D BETTER GET BACK TO THE SLUICE BOX TO GET SOME MORE OUT OF THERE THEN IF WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY OFF THE BOTTOM. [ MOTOR SLOWS, IDLES ] WHOA, THERE'S GOLD JAMMED IN THERE. WHOO, IN THE NOZZLE! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH THAT? I THINK YOU GOT A LITTLE PLUG-UP. LET ME CHECK THE BOX. HANG ON. I DON'T WANT ANDY TO KNOW THIS. I STILL GOT NO SUCTION. Yeah, still nothin', man. [ AIR HISSES ] [ MOTOR RUMBLING ] How's your suction now, A.? SUCTION'S GOOD, POP. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THE GOLD IN THERE. LOOK AT THAT PIECE. BABY NEEDS NEW SHOES, BRO. I GOT TO GET THAT GOLD, YOU KNOW. [ AIR HISSING ] Narrator: IN THE CENTER OF NOME... Emily: THIS PLACE JUST TURNS GOOD PEOPLE INTO DESERTERS. FOR THE SECOND SEASON IN A ROW, CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL NEEDS TO FIND A NEW CREW. EVERYBODY WHO DIVES ON A GOLD-MINING OPERATION JUST STARTS TO BELIEVE THAT THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON ANOTHER OPERATION. Narrator: TWO DAYS AGO... WAIT, YOU GUYS ARE BOTH LEAVING? I'M NOT GOING TO WORK FOR FREE. ...FED UP WITH BAD CLEANUPS AND EMILY'S LEADERSHIP, TONY AND DARYL CALLED IT QUITS. Emily: IT'S A HORRIBLE TIME FOR THOSE BOYS TO LEAVE. WE'RE AT THE END OF THE SEASON. WE ALSO HAVE A WEEK AHEAD OF US OF FANTASTIC WEATHER WHERE WE COULD BE PULLING ROUND-THE-CLOCK HOURS AND MAKING A TON OF GOLD. Narrator: NOW... I'M OUT SCOUTING FOR HIM RIGHT NOW. ALL I KNOW IS HE DRIVES A BLUE, LITTLE SAD PICKUP. Narrator: ...TO SAVE HER SEASON, EMILY IS OUT LOOKING FOR A BRAND-NEW DARYL -- VETERAN DREDGER DARYL GALIPEAU. DARYL GALIPEAU HAS BEEN MINING FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. HE'S BEEN MINING IN THE RIVERS OF CANADA TO THE BERING SEA. Narrator: SPEAK OF THE DARYL... I'M SEEING A TRUCK UP HERE THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE GALIPEAU'S. HA! HA HA! I THINK IT IS. I THINK I GOT HIM. I THINK I GOT HIM. Narrator: ...THE DARYL APPEARS. [ HORN HONKS ] ALL RIGHT. SPEEDING IN NOME. I HOPE THE ONE COP HERE DOESN'T CATCH ME. [ LAUGHS ] OKAY, THERE HE IS. HA HA! [ LAUGHS ] IS HE SPEEDING UP? [ HORN HONKS ] THRILL OF THE CHASE! WELL, THIS IS AWKWARD. UH, HEY. I HAD TO STALK YOU FOR A COUPLE MILES. I'M -- I'M SORRY. I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET BEFORE OFFICIALLY. UM, HEY. SORRY. I'M EMILY. HI. HI, EMILY. YEAH, NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU. I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS. REALLY? [ LAUGHS ] WHY, DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU? [ BOTH LAUGHING ] UM...BUT HEY, UM, YEAH. ONCE AGAIN, SORRY -- SORRY TO CHASE YOU DOWN. UM, UH, I WAS WONDERING, WHERE -- ARE YOU DIVING ANYWHERE THIS YEAR? WELL, I HAVE BEEN, BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, I JUST -- THIS IS LIKE THE FIRST YEAR EVER THAT, UH, LOOKS LIKE I MIGHT GET OUT OF HERE EARLY. I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, IT BEING SO LATE IN THE SEASON AND OUR AVERAGES BEING SO LOW ALL YEAR, WE NEED A [BLEEP] MIRACLE TO -- TO SURVIVE AND MAKE A PROFIT. HOW LOW ARE YOUR AVERAGES RUNNING? WE'RE RUNNING ABOUT QUARTER OUNCE AN HOUR WITH A 10. WOW. IT'S PRETTY PAINFUL. THAT'S PHENOMENALLY LOW. SO, YEAH. UM, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB, BUT, UM, THERE'S A SPOT AVAILABLE IF YOU WANT TO COME TRY IT OUT AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT. YOU KNOW, GENERALLY, THE SHARE IS 50% OF THE BOX AFTER THE LEASE OWNER. AND, UM -- THAT'S GOOD. DEFINITELY WORKS FOR ME. OKAY. IF THIS WORKS FOR YOU, THEN, UM, I THINK WE'RE ALL READY TO START TOMORROW. OKAY. AWESOME. HEY, GOOD TO MEET YOU. NICE MEETING YOU. LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. ALL RIGHT. HAVE A GOOD DAY. DRIVE SAFE. I PROMISE I WON'T CHASE YOU ANYMORE. OKAY. [ LAUGHS ] ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU LATER. WE'LL -- WE'LL SEE HOW THIS TURNS OUT. AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, I'M -- AT THIS POINT, WE NEED TO TRY ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY DO TO GET THE BOAT ON TO -- ON TO GOOD GOLD. Narrator: EMILY'S NOT THE ONLY ONE BRINGING ON A NEW CREW. SEVEN MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS OF RELIEVING STRESS IS TO FIRE ALL THOSE [BLEEP] THAT REALLY NEED TO BE FIRED, YOU KNOW? WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON IS ALSO LOOKING AT NEW FACES. ELAINE GOT ALL JACKED OUT OF SHAPE AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH AND, YOU KNOW, SO SHE QUIT. Narrator: TWO DAYS AGO... HEY, I'M JUST CALLING TO LET YOU KNOW I'M -- I'M DONE. I'M NOT GOING TO WORK FOR YOU ANYMORE. GET ON OUT OF HERE. DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU IN THE ASS. Narrator: AFTER VERNON'S DAUGHTER, ELAINE, QUIT, HE TOLD HER BOYFRIEND AND THE REST OF HIS DIVERS TO HIT THE BRICKS. A LOT OF TIMES, THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR A PERSON TO GET FIRED. IT MAKES THEM REALIZE EXACTLY WHERE THE BEAR [BLEEP] IN THE WOODS. SOMETIMES, IT'LL SNAP THEIR HEADS AROUND, AND THEY'LL BE BETTER PEOPLE FOR IT. WE CUT AWAY SOME OF THE DEADWOOD. I'M NOT PLAYING FOOTSIE WITH ANY OF THESE [BLEEP] ANYMORE. THEY EITHER PRODUCE, OR THEY GET -- GO ON, GET OUT OF MY LIFE. Narrator: NEW TO THE BOAT -- DIVERS BOBBY LOWE, KELSY LESSING, AS WELL AS A DIVER KNOWN ONLY AS WOLF. [ HOWLS ] NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHY. [ LAUGHS ] UH...UH... YEAH, HEY, KELSY. HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING DOWN THERE? VERN, THERE'S SOME DECENT GOLD DOWN HERE FOR SURE. THERE'S, LIKE, EXPOSED HARD PIT AND NO -- NOTHING BUT GOLD. IT'S JUST LINED UP. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. SO, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS PUSHED UP BY GLACIERS OR WHAT, BUT WE RAN INTO SOMETHING. THIS [BLEEP] COULD BE PAYING HALF OUNCE AN HOUR, EASY. Vernon: THE WORD'S OUT ON TOMCOD. A MULTITUDE OF FLOATING DREDGES OUT HERE. I GOT A LOT OF COMPETITION. Narrator: WHILE VERNON KEEPS AN EYE ON THE COMPETITION... 200 YARDS AWAY... I'M LOOKING FOR MATERIAL THAT WILL MAKE ME RICH. ...THE COMPETITION IS ABOUT TO GET TOUGHER. EVERY HOUR WE AIN'T PUTTING DIRT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN INTO THE WASH PAN, WE'RE LOSING MONEY. FRESH OFF THE PROSPECTING TRIP WITH HIS FAMILY, SHAWN POMRENKE HAS THE CHRISTINE ROSE BACK ON THE GROUNDS... TO GET STARTED UP TO GO INLAND MINING COSTS A TON OF MONEY. Narrator: ...AND BACK ON THE HUNT FOR GOLD. THE CHRISTINE ROSE IS SUPPORTING MY FAMILY, MY DAD'S FAMILY, JACOB'S, CODY'S, JESSE'S, AND ITSELF. PLUS, IT'S GONNA HAVE TO SUPPORT AN INLAND MINING OPERATION. Narrator: WITH A MASSIVE 826 OUNCES WORTH $900,000 ALREADY BANKED ON THE SEASON AND AN INLAND MINING OPERATION ON THE HORIZON, MR. GOLD IS PROPPING UP AN EMPIRE. Shawn: INLAND MINING, WELL, THE PLAN IS TO GO IN, MINE IT, TAKE ALL THE GOLD, AND RESITUATE THE WHOLE PLACE, MAKE IT NICE AND PRETTY. WELL, THEN, WE CAN JUST GO THROUGH IT AND SELL LOTS FOR HOUSES ALL AROUND. WE NEED GOOD, SOLID PAY DIRT. GOT JACOB TAKING SOME MATERIAL OUT OF THE BUCKET, GONNA TAKE A PAN. NOT ENOUGH. I KNOW THERE'S A REALLY GOOD SPOT RIGHT UP HERE, BUT ALL THESE LITTLE DREDGES HAVE MOVED IN. Narrator: IN ORDER TO KEEP THE FAMILY BUSINESS GROWING... ALMOST 20 DREDGES ON THE CLAIM. [BLEEP] RIDICULOUS. ...SHAWN WILL NEED TO FIGHT FOR HIS GOLD. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PROSPECTING. WE AIN'T MAKING ANY MONEY RIGHT NOW. WE'RE JUST SPENDING IT. HERE'S A SECOND PAN IN THIS AREA. NOT THAT GREAT. ALL THE GOOD STUFF'S RIGHT OVER HERE BY THE SUCTION DREDGES. I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO OVER THERE AND CLEAN THAT OUT. Narrator: FIRST UP ON THE HIT LIST -- VERNON ADKISON AND THE WILD RANGER. VERN AND THEM ARE ON MY SPOT. HE'S BEEN OUT THERE LAST WINTER AND THIS SUMMER, AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE THINKS HE'S GOT CLAIM TO THAT WHOLE AREA. WELL, I'M JUST GONNA OUT THERE DOING WHAT I DO. I THINK I'M GOING TO KICK HIS ASS. Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... Shawn: HERE'S A SECOND PAN IN THIS AREA. NOT THAT GREAT. ALL THE GOOD STUFF'S RIGHT OVER HERE BY THE SUCTION DREDGES. WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO OVER THERE AND CLEAN THAT OUT. Narrator: ...ON THE JAM-PACKED TOMCOD CLAIM, THE CHRISTINE ROSE AND WILD RANGER ARE LINING UP FOR A TURF WAR. BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES WITH GROUND TO PROTECT. Hank: WE'RE IN GOOD GOLD HERE. GOOD MATERIAL RIGHT HERE. YEAH, BABY! KEEP IT COMIN'. Narrator: FOR CAPTAIN HANK, THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN FINDING GOLD... IT'S PRETTY GOOD GOLD, SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE PROBABLY DOING A LITTLE BETTER THAN SHAWN RIGHT NOW. Narrator: ...IS WATCHING SHAWN NOT FIND IT. HE'S NOT DOING TOO GOOD TODAY. HE'S KIND OF LIKE ME YESTERDAY. HE'S JUST RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO FIND GOLD. LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S GOT. OH, MORE SAND. MORE SAND. HE'S JUST FINDING SAND TODAY. WHEN YOU'RE COMPETITION CAN'T FIND NO GOLD, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY. [ LAUGHS ] KIND OF CAME INTO THIS THING THINKING, YOU KNOW, I'D NEVER BEAT SHAWN. NOW I THINK I CAN PRETTY MUCH BEAT HIM. WHAT I KNOW NOW, SHAWN DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING ON ME. GOT TO KEEP AFTER IT. JUST GOT TO KEEP DIGGING. I'M NOT GOING TO GET OFF THIS THING UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. AND WE'RE IN SOME GOOD GOLD. I DON'T KNOW IF SHAWN'S GOT ANY YET THIS MORNING. I GUESS MR. GOLD CAN'T FIND NO GOLD. [ HANK LAUGHS ] THIS IS ABOUT OUR 10th TEST PAN. I DON'T REALLY GIVE A [BLEEP] WHAT HANK'S DOING TODAY 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN PANNING ALL AROUND HIM, AND I AIN'T FINDING [BLEEP]. AND THE PAN DOESN'T LOOK THAT GREAT. YEAH, THE HUNT CONTINUES. YEAH, I AIN'T SO WORRIED ABOUT HANK. IT'S ALL THESE LITTLE [BLEEP] SUCTION DREDGES COMING IN. THEY SEE ME DIGGIN' ONE SPOT AND THEN THEY ALL MOVE IN THERE. [BLEEP] VERN AND THE WILD RANGER. Narrator: ONLY 75 YARDS AWAY... Vernon: THE GOLD LOOKS REALLY GOOD. Narrator: WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON AND DIVER KELSY LESSING HAVE BEEN ON THE GOLD FOR THE LAST FOUR HOURS. A LOT OF AWESOME COLOR! I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO LAST, BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S FREAKIN' AWESOME. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY JUICY CLEANOUT. I GOT ALL THESE PEOPLE MOVING IN. I'M JUST DONE WITH IT. SO I AIN'T GOING TO LET 'EM DO IT ANYMORE. I'M JUST GOING TO BACK THE END OF MY SLUICE BOX UP RIGHT TO 'EM, DROP MY SPUDS, AND START DIGGIN' AND SMOKE 'EM OUT. THERE'S THE CHRISTINE ROSE MOVING ON IN. WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOIN'? SHAWN THINKS THE ENTIRE AREA BELONGS TO HIM, WHICH IS NOT THE FACT. BACKED UP RIGHT TO 'EM. NOW WE'RE GOING TO START RUNNIN' SOME DIRT WHETHER THERE'S GOLD IN IT OR NOT JUST TO PROVE A [BLEEP] POINT. SO HE KEEPS MOVIN' OVER. KEEPS MOVIN' OVER. WOW. YEAH, WELL. HE'S GOING TO SMOKE VERN'S BOAT OUT. THAT'S... THE DIVERS AREN'T GOING TO BE HAPPY WITH HIM. I'M GLAD IT'S NOT ME. I DON'T THINK -- I WOULDN'T DO THAT. YOU GOT TO SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT. 10 MINUTES HERE, THEY'LL BE DIVING IN A MUD CLOUD. Narrator: AS THE TAILINGS FROM THE CHRISTINE ROSE BLANKET THE WATER... Narrator: ...VISIBILITY DROPS TO NEARLY ZERO. OKAY. I HEAR YOU SAY VISIBILITY IS ABOUT A FOOT. THAT DOESN'T BODE WELL. HE'S GOT LESS THAN A FOOT OF VISIBILITY, AND IT'S A MURKY FOOT. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO WORK WHEN YOU GOT NO VIS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE BOYS KNOW THAT THEY DON'T COME AND JUMP ON MY SPOT. WE MAKE THE WATER REALLY, REALLY MURKY SO THE CLOSER WE GET TO PEOPLE, THE HARDER IT IS FOR THEM TO MINE. THEY CAN KISS MY ASS. I LOOK TO LEFT, LOOK TO MY RIGHT, AND YOU SEE -- I JUST SAW A WALL. IT'S JUST LIKE A WALL OF SILT, AND I COULDN'T SEE. LIKE LITERALLY, I COULDN'T SEE THIS. Vernon: THE POMRENKES, THEY'LL GET WHAT'S COMING TO THEM. THEIR DIVER CAME UP BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SEE A DAMN THING. [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW WHY. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. WELL, HERE WE GOT DREDGE FIVE, THE OLD HISTORIC DREDGE HERE THAT WAS MININ' UP UNTIL 1995. I WAS ROAMING THESE LANDS FOLLOWING THE ANCIENT BEACH LINE. OH, THE MANPOWER THAT PUT IN -- THEY PUT IN A MACHINE LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THIS THING. IT'S HUGE. THIS ONE CAME RIGHT AFTER THEY SET IT IN THE GROUND HERE RIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR II, I BELIEVE. AND THE STORY I HEARD IS THAT IT PAID FOR ITSELF THAT FIRST SEASON. A HUNDRED THOUSAND OUNCES THEY GOT IN THE FIRST YEAR. THESE GUYS WERE TAKING A NUMBER-TWO FLAT-HEADED SHOVEL AND SCRAPING THE SLUICE BOX WITH SHOVEL FULLS OF GOLD. DEFINITELY THOUSANDS OF OUNCES AT A TIME. IT IS ALWAYS SO NEAT TO COME BACK AND SEE ALL THIS OLD HISTORY HERE. QUITE THE MACHINE. Narrator: IN THE CITY OF NOME...
