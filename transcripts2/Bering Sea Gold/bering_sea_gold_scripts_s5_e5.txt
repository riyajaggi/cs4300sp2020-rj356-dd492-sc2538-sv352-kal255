 WHOA. JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT CAN'T GET ANY TOUGHER, IT ALWAYS DOES. Narrator: IN A MATTER OF HOURS, A 300-MILE-WIDE ARCTIC STORM WILL MAKE LANDFALL, MAKING AN ALREADY DIFFICULT JOB NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. WE'RE BARELY IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS ON OUR GOLD COUNT.

 CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: IN THE CITY OF NOME... Zeke: WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE SEASON. WE ONLY GOT, LIKE, 5 OR 6 DAYS LEFT. ...WITH JUST UNDER A WEEK TO TURN A PROFIT, CAPTAIN ZEKE TENHOFF IS LOOKING TO MAKE A CHANGE. DON'T REALLY HAVE THE HEART TO TELL THE GIRLS THAT I'M NOT SEEING MUCH GOLD IN THE SLUICE BOX. Narrator: SO FAR THIS SEASON, ZEKE'S PARTNERSHIP WITH EMILY RIEDEL AND HER TEAM OF GREENHORNS... COME THE [BLEEP] ON, YOU GUYS! ...HAS BEEN BIG ON DRAMA... 2.8 OUNCES, AGAIN. ...AND SHORT ON GOLD. NOW, ZEKE HAS GOT A NEW PLAN. RATHER THAN, LIKE, START, LIKE, FIRING PEOPLE AND MESSING EVERYTHING UP AND TELLING THE GIRLS THEY CAN'T DIVE AND MAKING THEM ALL UPSET AND HURTING THEIR LITTLE FEELINGS, I'M JUST GOING TO GET MY BROTHER FROM THE AIRPORT. IT'S KINDA, LIKE, HURT MY SOUL A LITTLE BIT TO NOT HAVE ANY BRO HELP. I NEED SOME BRO TIME. I NEED TO GET MY BROTHER UP HERE, AND I NEED TO ENJOY HIS COMPANY BECAUSE OTHERWISE, I'M GONNA GO CRAZY. I'M DONE HOLDING THESE GIRLS' HANDS. BETWEEN ME AND MY BROTHER, WE CAN PULL DOWN SOME SERIOUS HOURS AND, LIKE, TURN THIS AROUND. ALSO, MY BROTHER GABE IS REALLY GOOD WITH THE LADIES. HE'LL BE ABLE TO SMOOTH THEM OVER AND MANIPULATE THEM IN A WAY THAT I CAN'T, REALLY. GABE! AH! [ LAUGHING ] HOW'S IT GOING? NOT ONLY IS GABE A LOT OF FUN, BUT GABE IS AN EXPERIENCED DIVER. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING WHEN HE'S ON THE BOTTOM, AND I CAN TRUST HIM TO PUT A LOT OF GOLD IN THE BOX. HONESTLY, LIKE, WE NEED TO GET SOME MORE GOLD IN THE SLUICE BOX, LIKE, STAT, DUDE. AND I ALSO NEED, LIKE, HELP AS KIND OF A BUFFER BETWEEN ME AND, LIKE, THESE GIRLS. AND... I'LL BUFF 'EM OUT FOR YA. YOU'RE GONNA BUFF 'EM OUT FOR ME? [ BOTH LAUGH ] Narrator: WHILE ZEKE AND GABE GET READY FOR SOME BUFFING, 2 MILES TO THE WEST, THE WILD RANGER IS ON THE MOVE. FIXIN' THE HOSE RIGHT HERE, CONNECTED OVER THERE. SO IT'S GOTTA COME AROUND ON THAT SIDE. Narrator: $100,000 IN THE HOLE FOR HIS STATE-OF-THE-ART SUB-DREDGE... HELP ME MOVE THE BARS. ...VERNON HAS LESS THAN A WEEK TO MAKE IT PAY. FINALLY GOT VERNON CONVINCED THAT WE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO MOVE IF WE WERE GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY THIS WINTER. Narrator: ON THEIR LAST ATTEMPT... I CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE'S GOOD GOLD OVER THERE, BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE'S NOT GOLD HERE. ...VERNON'S CREW CONVINCED HIM TO SPEND THE NECESSARY TIME AND MONEY TO MOVE THE ENTIRE OPERATION. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. YEAH. Narrator: NOW... ALL RIGHT, BOBBY. ...WITH JUST DAYS REMAINING, IT'S TIME TO SEE IF THE GAMBLE WILL PAY OFF. WE ONLY GOT ANOTHER FEW DAYS LEFT IN THE SEASON. THIS COMING HOLE, IT'LL MAKE US OR BREAK US. BUT, UH, ACCORDING TO THE DIVERS, THERE IS A SANDBAR NEAR OUR -- OUR PRESENT LOCATION, WHICH'LL BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT THIS MACHINE -- WHAT THE SUB-DREDGE CAN DO. OKAY. DROP IT DOWN. THE LAST HURRAH! I HOPE THIS HOLE PAYS WELL 'CAUSE I WANNA SEE GREAT GOLD. WE COULD HAVE A MAJOR PAYDAY HERE, SHORTLY. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: THE PLAN IS TO CAPITALIZE ON A POTENTIALLY GOLD-RICH SPOT, WHERE ONLY A DENSE SANDBAR COVERS THE PAY LAYER, PERFECT GROUNDS FOR THE SUB-DREDGE. ALL RIGHT, I GOT A VISUAL ON THE UMBILICAL. I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET CAUGHT UNDERNEATH THE, UH, THE TRAP. GOT ABOUT 7 FEET. EASY. AND TOUCHDOWN! OKAY. FIRE IT UP. FIRIN' IT UP. I'M HOPIN' IT PAYS OUT FOR US, BUDDY. Narrator: WHILE VERNON AND CREW START CHEWING UP THE SAND, 100 MILES TO THE EAST... AT THE BLUFF... WE GOT ANOTHER DAY. WE GONNA DO ANOTHER DIVE. THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. ...WITH AN ARCTIC STORM LOOMING, THE POMRENKE CREW IS ON THE HUNT FOR THE MOTHER LODE. MAYBE THIS'LL BE OUR LUCKY HOLE. MAYBE IT'LL BE JUST LIKE THE REST. BUT WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT A SHOT. WE GOTTA GET LOADED UP. WE'RE HEADING TO OUR LAST HOLE OF THE YEAR. HOPEFULLY IT'S A GOOD ONE. WE HAVEN'T HIT A REAL GOOD ONE YET. Narrator: AFTER SPENDING 30 GRAND ON A MINING EXPEDITION IN THE WILD, "MR. GOLD" IS STILL A LITTLE LIGHT ON GOLD. Steve: PICKED OUT THIS SPOT YESTERDAY. HIGH, HIGH HOPES. Narrator: FIVE DAYS AGO, SHAWN'S FATHER AND BUSINESS PARTNER, STEVE... THAT'S THE OLD MAN. [ BARKING ] OH, NO! ...SHOWED UP TO LAY DOWN THE LAW... ANYTHING GETTIN' DONE AROUND HERE? ...AND HELP PUT THE CREW ON PAY DIRT. THERE'S A STREAK ABOUT 100 FEET WIDE. Narrator: AFTER A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION... HOLY [BLEEP]! THAT'S A BIG [BLEEP]! ...THEY'RE STILL SEARCHING FOR THAT BONANZA. GOTTA GET ONE MORE HOLE IN HERE! COME ON! I THINK I HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR SHAWN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MY DAD EXPECTED OUTTA ME. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS SURVIVE AND THRIVE, I GOTTA STAY ON 'EM. ALL RIGHT. NOW LET'S FIND SOME MORE. OTHERWISE, YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE. Narrator: UNDER THE GUN FROM THE OLD MAN, IT'S TIME TO PUT UP OR SHUT UP. Shawn: WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY NICE WEATHER. DAD SHOWS UP, BRINGS [BLEEP] WEATHER. [ MEN LAUGH ] BUT AT LEAST HE'S HERE, HELPIN' OUT WITH THE LAST COUPLE HOLES HERE. SO GLAD TO SEE HIM OUT HERE. I'M REALLY GLAD TO BE HERE, TOO, BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE WHAT KIND OF GOLD WE GOT HERE FOR THE FUTURE OF THAT BOAT WE GOT IN THE HARBOR SITTIN' UP THERE. HE COME OUT, THINKIN' WE WERE JUST [BLEEP] AROUND OUT HERE. BUT, UH, YOU WANNA FIND GOLD, YOU BETTER WORK YOUR ASS OFF. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOIN'. Narrator: WHILE FATHER AND SON GET SET UP TO DIVE, 100 MILES WEST... AT THE CLARK... ...DIVER JEN NEWBY WRAPS UP A 4-HOUR SHIFT UNDER THE ICE. VERY NICE! GREAT JOB, MAN. RIGHT ON! THANK YOU. HOW'D YOU FEEL DOWN THERE? IT WAS AWESOME. REAL GOOD, HUH? RIGHT ON, RIGHT ON. AWESOME. THESE ARE MOTIVATED, HARD-WORKING WOMEN WITH A REAL CHANCE AT SUCCEEDING UP HERE AS GOLD MINERS. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE KIND OF GOLD WE NEED TO MAKE TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL SEASON, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BRING IN ANOTHER DIVER. TROUBLE IS ARRIVING! AND ZEKE BRINGS UP GABE. GABERS! EMBRACE ME! WOW. [ LAUGHS ] OH, THIS IS -- THIS IS GREAT. WHOA. BRING IT IN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. [ BOTH GRUNTING ] THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT'S UP? OKAY, WE'RE TURNING INTO A FRAT HOUSE. WELCOME TO THE FRAT HOUSE, MAN. YEAH, TOTALLY. I'M GABE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] I'VE BEEN COMING DOWN TO NOME AND BEEN DREDGING FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS, SO I KNOW WHAT GOOD GOLD LOOKS LIKE ON THE BOTTOM, AND I KNOW HOW TO MOVE GROUND. I'M A HARD WORKER, YOU KNOW? AND I'LL GET [BLEEP] DONE. WORK YOUR WAY ALONG THE SANDBAR, AND THEN AS FAR LEFT AS YOU SEE GOLD FROM THE SANDBAR, TOO. ME, TOO. I WORK REALLY WELL WITH ZEKE. YOU KNOW, HE'S MY BROTHER. WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS A SMILE ON HIS FACE AND US BEING PRODUCTIVE. IT'S PRETTY COOL HAVING THE CEILING LIKE THAT. I'VE NEVER DOVE UNDER THE ICE BEFORE. Zeke: I KEEP FORGETTING THAT YOU'VE NEVER GONE ICE DIVING BEFORE. CONGRATULATIONS. REMEMBER, REGULATOR FREEZE-UPS CAN AND WILL HAPPEN. YEAH, SO ANY BREATH COULD VERY LIKELY BE YOUR LAST. [ LAUGHS ] I KNOW IT'S NOT SAFE, BUT THAT'S OKAY. IT'S A TRIP DOWN HERE. IT'S SO CLEAR. I'M NOT USED TO HAVING SUCH GOOD VIS. ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT MAXIMUM SUCTION THERE, SIR. SUCK UP SOME GOLD. I DON'T THINK HE'S HERE JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A BUNCH OF LADIES HERE. I THINK HE'S HERE 'CAUSE HE WANTS GOLD. WELL, GABE, ARE YOU SEEIN' ANY GOLD? I ACTUALLY JUST HAD A LITTLE CHUNK RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. THERE IS GOLD DOWN HERE. COPY THAT. NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! YEAH. OKAY. WHAT'S UP? Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, AT THE CLARK... HEY, GABE, ARE YOU SEEIN' ANY GOLD? I ACTUALLY JUST HAD A LITTLE CHUNK RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. THERE IS GOLD DOWN HERE. COPY THAT. NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Narrator: UNDER THE ICE, ZEKE'S BABY BROTHER GABE IS ON THE GOLD... ...BUT HE'S NOT ALONE. WHAT'S UP? OKAY. THERE'S A SEAL? SERIOUSLY? WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE YOU COMING UP? GABE, STAY DOWN THERE. YOU'RE FINE. IT'S JUST A SEAL. [ LAUGHS ] ARE YOU COMIN' UP? WELL, GABE'S UP? OH, NO. HOW BIG WAS HE, DUDE? HUGE, DUDE! HE WAS, LIKE, FROM ME TO THE GENERATOR. REALLY? AND, LIKE, THIS BIG AROUND. A BIG OL' 400-POUND SEAL WANTED ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS MOTIVES WERE. DUDE, I DON'T NEED THAT IN MY LIFE, MAN. YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GO BACK DOWN? THING ABOUT GABE, HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, I'M MR. TOUGH GUY." HE'S NOT REALLY. HERE. WHAT IF I GAVE YOU THIS THING? YOU REALLY GONNA SALLY OUT AND COME OUT AND FREAK OUT 'CAUSE A LITTLE SEAL COME AND LOOKED AT YOU? TAKE THIS WITH YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS, LIKE, SOME POSEIDON [BLEEP] RIGHT HERE. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET BACK IN THE DARK ICE HOLE WITH THE 500-POUND SEA MAMMAL TO PUT MONEY IN YOUR GUYS' POCKET. SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. YOU KNOW, ICE MINING, THERE'S A LOT OF INHERENT RISK. AND HONESTLY, LIKE, EVEN IN SUMMER DREDGING, I'VE NEVER ONCE BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE I HAD TO DITCH MY WEIGHT BELT AND DO AN EMERGENCY ASCENT. BUT -- AND I WON'T LIE, DUDE. I AM TERRIFIED OF THAT CUTE, LITTLE BASTARD. WHERE IS THAT SEAL? Zeke: I HOPE GABE CAN GO DOWN AND PUT AT LEAST 5 OR 6 HOURS ON THE BOX, LIKE, MINIMUM. AND HE BETTER NOT SALLY OUT IF JULIUS THE SEAL COMES BACK, 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY GOLD IF WE GET SCARED OUT OF THE WATER BY LITTLE SEALS. Narrator: WHILE THE UNDERSEA WARRIOR HEADS BACK DOWN TO DO BATTLE, TOPSIDE, THE MASSIVE ARCTIC STORM BEGINS ITS ASSAULT ON THE FLEET. ♪ EVERYBODY, COME INSIDE FOR A MINUTE AND GET WARM! THE CONDITIONS ARE EXTREMELY HARSH. GOD HELP THE POMRENKES. THEY'RE DOWN AT BLUFF. THE BIG STORM ROLLS IN, THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO. Narrator: 100 MILES EAST OF TOWN, FAR FROM ANY HOPE OF RESCUE, SHAWN POMRENKE AND CREW... IT'S A [BLEEP] BLIZZARD OUT HERE RIGHT NOW! ...ARE FEELING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE STORM. IT'S REAL STORMY OUT! IT'S A BLIZZARD! CAN'T EVEN SEE ANYTHING OUT HERE! I NEED TO GET DOWN, GET OUT OF THE STORM. NOW THE OLD MAN GETS TO SEE WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO OUT HERE. IT'D BREAK A WEAKER MAN. SNOW AND BLIZZARD BLOWIN', YOU KNOW, WHICH MAKES IT MISERABLE. BUT YOU GOTTA GET YOUR JOB DONE. YOU GOTTA GET YOUR JOB DONE. YOU GET OUT THERE AND DO YOUR JOB. MIGHT BE SOME WEATHER COMIN' IN HERE, HUH, BOYS? I SEEM TO BE ALWAYS TRYIN' TO PROVE MYSELF TO HIM, MAN. HEY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE WORKIN' HARD, AND IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO CONVINCE HIM THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING. Narrator: PROVING HIMSELF TO DAD IN THESE CONDITIONS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. IF THE WIND TURNS THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THE TIDE IS RIGHT, IT BREAKS THE ICE FREE FROM THE BEACH. AND THEN IT'LL BLOW IT RIGHT OUT INTO THAT OPEN WATER, AND WE'LL BE GOIN' RIGHT WITH IT ALL THE WAY TO RUSSIA. Narrator: THE STRONG OFFSHORE WINDS CAN RAISE THE TIDES, CRACKING THE SHORE-FAST ICE AND CARRYING CREW AND GEAR OUT INTO THE BERING SEA. NEED TO SNIFF SOME GOLD OUT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CAN FIND ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS TRIP WORTHWHILE. YEAH, ROGER THAT. WE GOTTA FIND SOMETHIN'. [ GROANING ] HERE WE GO. Shawn: HOW'S IT LOOKIN' DOWN THERE? THE BOTTOM LOOKS PRETTY COOL. I LIKE THE SAND, WHERE IT MEETS THAT BEDROCK. HOW'S THE STORM UP THERE? IS IT STILL BLOWIN'? IT AIN'T FLORIDA! IT'S BLOWIN' LIKE HELL UP HERE. YEAH, IT'S SUNNY AND 70 DOWN HERE. THESE CRACKS ARE REAL INTERESTING LOOKING. MIGHT BE SOME GOLD DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE DEEP. THOSE PUMPS IDLE ALL THE WAY UP? YEAH, THEY ARE. SUCTION FEELS A LITTLE WEAK. YEAH. I THINK I GOT A CLOG. I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK REAL QUICK. IT'S [BLEEP] STUCK! OH, HE'S NOT HAPPY. HE'S GOT A BUG UP. [BLEEP] YOU! MY AIR FEELS LIKE IT'S GETTING PRETTY RESTRICTED. NOW MY AIR IS DEFINITELY GETTING... SOMETHIN' FEELS FUNNY. HOW'S THE PRESSURE? COME ON, BABY. [ BLEEP ] COME ON UP. YEAH, WE JUST BROKE THE RECOIL ON THE PUMP. YEAH. GET YOUR ASS UP HERE. [ BLEEP ] COME ON UP. COME ON UP. Narrator: AT THE BLUFF... [ BLEEP ] COME ON UP. YEAH. WE JUST BROKE THE RECOIL ON THE PUMP. YEAH. GET YOUR ASS UP HERE. [ BLEEP ] COME ON UP. COME ON UP. YEAH, BEFORE THE AIR COMPRESSOR DIED, HE WENT TO RESTART IT, THE WHOLE ROPE ON THE STARTER BROKE. SO NOW IT'S, UH, IMPERATIVE THAT CODY GETS HIS BUTT UP HERE. SO DUMB. IT'S REAL SCARY WHEN YOU RUN OUTTA AIR. WHEN I CAME BACK UP AND MY MASK WAS ALL FOGGED, I THINK I GOT A LITTLE WATER IN THERE, 'CAUSE I STARTED FREEZIN' UP AFTER THAT. [BLEEP] DON'T [BLEEP] WANNA WORK OUT HERE. WE'RE RUNNIN' OUTTA TIME. THINGS ARE GOIN' TO HELL. DO WE QUIT RIGHT NOW AND HEAD BACK TO TOWN? I DON'T KNOW. SEE, I DON'T LIKE THAT STUFF HAPPENING AT ALL, BUT IT HAPPENS. BUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, FIX THE PROBLEM. Narrator: WITH CODY'S DIVE A BUST AND THE BLIZZARD WORSENING, SHAWN HAS A CHOICE -- KNUCKLE DOWN AND FACE THE STORM, OR CALL IT QUITS AND FACE THE DAD. WEATHER'S [BLEEP] HORRIBLE. WE MIGHT BE STUCK HERE. SO YOU WANNA BE A GOLD MINER? COME JOIN US. Narrator: BACK IN NOME, AT THE STORM-BATTERED CLARK... MAN, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT SEAL IS. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT DIVING UNDER THE ICE? UH, YOU KNOW, IT'S QUITE A BIT LIKE DIVING IN THE SUMMERTIME TILL YOU LOOK UP AND REALIZE THAT YOU'RE IN A MAXIMUM SECURITY ICE PRISON, WITH JULIUS THE SEAL LICKING HIS CHOPS... [ LAUGHTER ] EXAMINING MY FORMFITTING NEOPRENE WET SUIT. Narrator: WHILE GABE AND THE GREENHORNS ARE SOLDIERING ON THROUGH THE WEATHER, INSIDE THE SHACK... HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MAKING MONEY FOR EMILY? DON'T ASK QUESTIONS YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW THE ANSWER TO. [ ZEKE AND GABE LAUGH ] HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MAKING MONEY FOR MY GOLD COFFERS? NO? NO. WHY? WELL, I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PERSONAL. EVERYTHING'S PERSONAL. I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN ZEKE. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN IN MY LIFE IN SOME CAPACITY. I THINK THAT IT'LL BENEFIT ZEKE AND I IN THE LONG RUN TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER. AND A LOT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BULL [BLEEP] WE HAVE TO PLOW THROUGH, WE CAN GET THROUGH IT IF WE HAD MORE TIME. MAYBE LIKE IF -- IF YOU AND I ARE BOTH, LIKE, PRACTICAL PEOPLE, WE WOULD JUST, LIKE, NOT EVER DO BUSINESS TOGETHER AGAIN. WHAT AM I DIGGING FOR? YEAH. I DON'T KNOW. HONESTY. HONESTY? YEAH. YOU AND GABE ARE, LIKE, UNCOMFORTABLE, LIKE, MAKING ME GOLD BECAUSE OF, LIKE, WHATEVER, LIKE, PAST [BLEEP] WENT DOWN. IT'S LIKE, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW? [ BLEEP ] HE HAS A LOT OF ISSUES WITH ME, AND HE'S NOT GONNA, LIKE, LET IT GO FOR A LONG TIME, IF EVER. BUT IN ALL -- FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, HE'S A GOOD GOLD MINER. AND, UH, I NEED TO BE WORKING WITH GOOD GOLD MINERS. AND ZEKE IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM. WHAT CAN I SAY? IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT IN A LOT OF WAYS. Narrator: JUST WEST OF THE HARBOR... ON THE PADDY WAGON... WHOA. LOOK AT THIS [BLEEP]. ...THE WINTER STORM HAS LEFT KRIS KELLY'S LITTLE OPERATION A BIG MESS. SO HERE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF SPRING, AND WE'VE GOT A HUGE ARCTIC STORM. ALL THIS IS GONNA DO IS [BLEEP] EVERYBODY. EVERYTHING'S GOTTA ALWAYS GO BAD FOR ME, I SWEAR TO GOD. TRYIN' TO MAKE THE BEST OF THIS [BLEEP] IS GONNA BE A [BLEEP] DAY. Narrator: FOR KRIS, THOSE KIND OF DAYS ARE PRETTY MUCH PAR FOR THE COURSE THIS WINTER. ALL WE GOTTA DO IS JUST WORK TOGETHER AND GET THIS DONE. Narrator: AFTER SETTING OUT TO RUN HIS OWN OPERATION... PADDY WAGON FIRST ON GOLD THIS SEASON! EVERYBODY ELSE CAN [BLEEP]. ...HIS DREDGE BROKE. I'LL DO IT MYSELF, YOU [BLEEP] IDIOT! ...HIS BROTHER QUIT... I GOT 2.1 OUNCES. ...AND HE'S ONLY MADE $3,100 IN GOLD. AS FOR HIS NEIGHBOR, ARCHNEMESIS, AND FATHER, KRIS' STRUGGLES ARE ALL PART OF THE MASTER PLAN. I JUST NEED KRIS TO TAKE A WALK ON OVER TO THE WILD SIDE HERE AND JUST SAY, "[BLEEP], YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD? I CAN'T DO IT." THERE'S NO SHAME IN IT. YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE FAILED, DUDE? I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FINGERS TO COUNT THE FAILURES. I HAVEN'T, BY ANY CHANCE, FAILED. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THERE YET. I STILL HAVE TIME TO TURN THIS AROUND. I DON'T NEED TO GO WITH A BUNCH OF FAILURE. Narrator: WITH LESS THAN A WEEK LEFT IN THE SEASON, KRIS CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THE STORM STOP HIM FROM MINING. I THINK WE GOT PRETTY LUCKY. LOOK AT, UH, OUR WHOLE PATHWAY HERE IS CLEAN. SOMEBODY WANTS US TO MAKE IT TODAY. UH, AFTER GETTING HERE AND ASSESSING THE SITUATION, IT'S NOT AS BAD AS I WAS LED TO BELIEVE. AW, [BLEEP]. OKAY, IT'S NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT GOOD, THAT'S FOR SURE. THIS IS [BLEEP]. MY POOR LITTLE LEPRECHAUN. HE DOESN'T LIKE THE SNOW EITHER. AND SEE, HE'S STILL GOT THE THUMBS UP. EVERYTHING'S FINE. MONKEY HEATER'S BURIED IN SNOW. EVERYTHING'S BURIED IN SNOW. CABIN'S BURIED IN SNOW. IT'S GONNA BE A [BLEEP] DAY TODAY. Narrator: 400 YARDS AWAY, AT THE WILD RANGER... WATCH YOUR TRACKS. ...WHILE THE WIND IS WHIPPING ABOVE THE SURFACE, BENEATH THE ICE... THERE YOU GO. ...VERNON'S SUB-DREDGE IS WHIPPING UP SOME GOLD. PERFECT. AWESOME. THAT'S LOOKIN' REAL GOOD. THIS THING OUGHTA MOVE FIVE TIMES THE MATERIAL THAT A DIVER CAN MOVE. I'M HEARIN' ALL THESE NOISES AND -- AND IT'S ALL SOUNDIN' LIKE, "CHA-CHING, CHA-CHING, CHA-CHING." IT'S GOTTA BE GOLD IN THAT BOX. THIS COULD SAVE OUR SEASON. Narrator: AFTER SPENDING 100 GRAND, THE SKIPPER IS FINALLY SEEING SOME RESULTS. YEAH, YOU GOT PLENTY OF MATERIAL TO YOUR LEFT. GOT SOME GREAT DEPTH. THERE YOU GO. AWESOME. STOP DREDGIN' FOR A SECOND, PLEASE. GUYS... LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME KIND OF A LEAK. [ KNOCKS ON WINDOW ] COME IN HERE. SOMETHIN'S GOIN' ON. STANDBY. SOMETHIN'S GOIN' ON. WHAT'S UP? I THINK... BOBBY, LISTEN TO ME. YOU'VE GOT TO FEED ME INFORMATION. FEED ME INFORMATION, OVER. [ BLEEP ] WE'RE OUTTA BUSINESS. RIGHT HERE, THIS IS CRITICAL [BLEEP] EQUIPMENT! I WANT -- I WANT EVERYBODY THAT WORKS FOR THIS [BLEEP] OUTFIT HERE NOW. Narrator: AT THE WILD RANGER... GUYS... LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME KIND OF A LEAK. BOBBY, FEED ME INFORMATION, OVER. THIS IS NOT GOOD. Narrator: A POSSIBLE OIL LEAK FROM THE SUB-DREDGE HAS BROUGHT PRODUCTION TO A HALT. I WANT EVERYBODY THAT WORKS FOR THIS [BLEEP] OUTFIT HERE NOW. Narrator: ARRIVING ON SCENE, SUB-DREDGE TECHNICIAN AND ENGINEER PHIL REINER. ALL RIGHT. WHAT HAPPENED? OKAY. THIS IS -- NUMBER ONE, LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS. SERIOUS [BLEEP] BUSINESS. OKAY, THIS IS THE KINDA [BLEEP] THAT CAN SHUT US DOWN AND POSSIBLY PUT ME IN JAIL. SO I'D -- IT'S -- IT'S [BLEEP] SERIOUS, OKAY? AND THIS MIGHT END UP IN COURT, OKAY? IT MIGHT END UP IN COURT. IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE OIL. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. YOU BOUGHT IT, AND THAT'S WHY IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY, IS SO IT'S SAFE OIL. I FLAT DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP]. I DO NOT WANNA MAKE A MESS IN THIS OCEAN. I DON'T CARE IF IT -- IF YOU COOKED YOUR FRENCH FRIES IN IT LAST NIGHT, OKAY? SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN'. YEAH, IT'S VEGETABLE OIL. ALL RIGHT. AND YOU CAN COOK YOUR FRENCH FRIES IN IT. THAT SAID, LET'S GET THE RIG POWERED BACK UP, MOVE IT OVER UNDER THE HOLE, LIFT IT, AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. Narrator: EVEN WITH THE MACHINE RUNNING ON BIODEGRADABLE OIL, VERNON ISN'T ABOUT TAKE ANY CHANCES. Vernon: I DON'T WANT EVEN ONE DROP OF ANY KINDA OIL, VEGETABLE OIL OR NOT, GOING IN THE WATER. WHEN I WAS A SHIP'S CAPTAIN, UH, ONE DROP IN THE WATER THERE, AND VALDEZ WILL SHUT YOU DOWN. YOU'RE TALKIN' HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A DAY. SO IF THERE WAS A LOT, IT WOULDA WORKED OUT TO THE INSIDE OF THE TRACK. AND I DON'T -- I DON'T REALLY SEE ANYTHING HERE. WE'RE DONE UNTIL I'M 100%. I MEAN, IT'S... YEAH. GAME'S OVER. I CANNOT HAVE ANY LEAKS, PERIOD. YEAH. NONE, ZERO, ZILCH, NADA. VERNON SAYS WE'RE DONE, BUT WE'RE NOT DONE TILL WE DIAGNOSE IT. JUST SEEMS LIKE ANOTHER LITTLE HICCUP. ALL OF THESE ARE JUST THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH MINING. VERNON LIKES TO FREAK OUT OVER THINGS AND MAKE BIG DEALS OVER NOTHING. YEP. IT'S BROKE, FIX IT. GET BACK TO WORK. THIS IS TOTALLY [BLEEP]. WE'RE DONE. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] ON TOP OF IT. Narrator: WHILE VERNON HITS THE PANIC BUTTON... [ GROANS ] 400 YARDS AWAY, AT THE PADDY WAGON... WELL, I JUST -- I'M IN A BAD MOOD RIGHT NOW. Narrator: PUSHING HARD TO GET BACK IN THE WATER, KRIS KELLY NEEDS ALL HANDS ON DECK. WE DON'T NEED THAT TRACTOR GOIN'. WE DON'T NEED THAT TRACTOR GOING. Narrator: AND RIGHT NOW, ALL HANDS ARE NOT ON DECK. HEY, DUDE, YOU KNOW, ALL WE GOTTA DO NOW IS TURN THE HOT WATER ON AND GET GOING. WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING CLEARED OUT. OKAY, WHATEVER. WHAT DOES PLOWING EVERYBODY A ROAD HAVE TO DO WITH MAKING MONEY TODAY? I'M SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYBODY'S [BLEEP] EXCUSES, WHY WE CAN'T DO THIS. I PICKED A BUNCH OF [BLEEP] PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] ABOUT MAKING MONEY AT ALL. I PICKED THE WRONG [BLEEP] CREW, THAT'S ALL IT COMES DOWN TO. AND THERE WE ARE, PLOWING THAT [BLEEP] ROAD. WHAT THE [BLEEP]? WHAT THE [BLEEP]?! Narrator: KRIS' HOPES OF GETTING A DIVER UNDER THE ICE ARE GETTING PLOWED. UH, IT'S NOT GOIN' TOO GOOD RIGHT NOW. WELL, I AM. EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS TO PLOW A ROAD FOR EVERYBODY ELSE LIKE A [BLEEP] IDIOT! WELL, IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE A ROAD OUT HERE. [ BLEEP ]! [ BLEEP ]! I DON'T WANT A ROAD FOR EVERYBODY ELSE! I WANT HIM TO GO TO WORK! WHO'S [BLEEP] TEAM IS HE ON?! YES, IT DOES. SOUNDS LIKE THEIR WHOLE OPERATION. GOOD JOB, BILL! HE [BLEEP]. I'M GONNA SMASH THAT [BLEEP] WITH MY SHOVEL. YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE I WANNA [BLEEP] WORK! EVERYBODY WANTS TO [BLEEP] AROUND! THREE DAYS ON SOME TRACTOR?! [ BLEEP ] I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE DOESN'T WANNA [BLEEP] ON HOT, COLD. WHAT TIME IS IT RIGHT NOW? OH, MAN, IT'S... WANNA GO FOR LUNCH? NO, I WANNA GO SMASH THAT [BLEEP] WITH MY SHOVEL. NEXT YEAR, I'LL HAVE A BETTER CREW. ALL I GOTTA DO IS DIG THIS OUT, AND WE'RE READY TO ROCK AND ROLL. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NEVER REALLY HAD GREAT SUCCESS AS A FAMILY BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZY, YOU KNOW? AND I WANNA GET AWAY FROM THAT. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. I'M NOT DONE YET. 'KAY, YOU DO WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT, AND GO FOR LUNCH. [ REVS ENGINE ] Narrator: WHILE KRIS GETS BACK TO SHOVELING, OUT AT THE BLUFF, IN THE HEART OF THE STORM... WE'RE GONNA GET ONE MORE DIVE IN, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA CALL IT. Narrator: AFTER A BROKEN PULL CORD BROUGHT A DANGEROUS END TO CODY'S DIVE, SHAWN POMRENKE IS PUSHING ON. NONSTOP, BLOWIN' 20, 25 OUTTA THE SOUTHEAST, BUT SHAWN'S GETTIN' ALL SUITED UP, GETTIN' READY TO GO DOWN. OOH! GET SOME EXCITEMENT GOIN' HERE. WE NEED SOME EXCITEMENT GOING.
