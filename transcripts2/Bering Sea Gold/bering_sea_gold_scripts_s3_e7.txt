 [ ENGINE REVS ] Glen: A LEAD HAS OPENED, AND THE MISS NOMER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. THE MISS NOMER'S FLOATING OUT TO SEA, AND WE HAVE TO GO SAVE IT. SO, THIS IS [BLEEP] CRAZY.

 THE ICE IS TALKING TO US AND TELLING US, "IT'S NOT GONNA BE LONG BEFORE YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE." WE'RE READY TO GET WET AND GO TO BATTLE. KEEP STRONG, BOYS! Narrator: AS TEMPERATURES RISE... Glen: IT'S ALMOST 50 DEGREES TODAY. MOST OF THE ICE IS MELTING. JAS AND I ARE GONNA DREDGE AS LATE AS WE HAVE TO, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT. Narrator: ...THE FLEET IS SCRAMBLING FOR EVERY LAST OUNCE OF GOLD. I FEEL LIKE WE GOT THIS LAST MOVE, BUT AFTER THIS, IT MIGHT BE ALL OVER WITH. HOPEFULLY THERE'S A TON OF GOLD AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS HOLE. Narrator: SIX MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... Zeke: I'M TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER AN ICE OPERATION IN A TIME CRUNCH WITH A LIMITED BUDGET AND NOT REALLY ANY CUSHION FINANCIALLY IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG. Narrator: ...DIVER ZEKE TENHOFF AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, SARAH DUNN, ARE BACK ON THE ICE... Sarah: VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. ...AND BACK IN BUSINESS. Zeke: WELL, FOR THE PAST WEEK AND A HALF, TWO WEEKS SINCE GLEN AND I SPLIT UP, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN ON KIND OF A ROLLER COASTER, LIKE, KIND OF CONFIDENCE WISE. EIGHT DAYS AGO... MY OBSERVATION IS THERE MUST BE SOMETHING GOING ON IN YOUR BRAIN. HEY [BLEEP] YOUR [BLEEP] SMIRK, YOU [BLEEP] PUNK. ...ZEKE'S PARTNERSHIP WITH GLEN LeBARON ON THE MISS NOMER IMPLODED, LEAVING THE VETERAN DIVER WITHOUT A WORKING OPERATION. Zeke: LIKE, WHAT'S CAUSING ME CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS ICE IS GETTING SOFT AND THIN, AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET UNDER THERE AND GET SOME GOLD. Narrator: UNWILLING TO CALL IT QUITS ON THE SEASON, ZEKE HAS SUNK ALL HIS PROFITS FROM THE MISS NOMER INTO REBUILDING HIS OLD RIG. IT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT ENOUGH TO BE RUNNING AGAIN, AND I JUST NEED TO GET DOWN THERE. I NEED ROUGHLY, YOU KNOW, THREE, FOUR OUNCES JUST TO BREAK EVEN. I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN UNDERWATER YET. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT DOWN THERE. YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY, THIS SPOT IS GOOD. THE PLACE I WAS DREDGING WITH GLEN I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO INDEPENDENTLY FROM GLEN. SO, I'M DREDGING IN AN AREA THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN EXPLORED. IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN PROSPECTED REALLY BY ANYBODY. IT'S OVER NEAR TOMCOD. THERE'S KNOWN TO BE GOLD IN THE AREA, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE EXACTLY, SO IT'S KIND OF A SHOT IN THE DARK A LITTLE BIT. Sarah: WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA. IF HE GETS DOWN THERE AND WE'RE NOT ON ANYTHING, IT'S GONNA BE THIS WHOLE ROLLER COASTER OF "WHAT NEXT?" BUT MY JOB IS TO KEEP OPTIMISTIC, SO I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC. I THINK THINGS ARE GONNA GO JUST SWELL. MY GIRLFRIEND -- I MEAN, SHE'S A GREAT PARTNER IN A LOT OF WAYS. YOU LOOK LIKE A SUPERHERO. YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] SARAH IS AN ENDLESS SOURCE OF, LIKE, POSITIVITY AND MOTIVATION AND MORAL SUPPORT. GLEN WOULD BE VERY PROUD OF YOU TO SEE HIS LITTLE INTERMEDIATE DREDGER DOING SO WELL. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S DICEY. IT'S A GAMBLE. I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY. THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE SEASON. BUT IF I GET OUT THERE AND I FIND SOME REALLY GOOD GOLD, THAT'S GONNA GIVE ME JUICE, IT'S GONNA GIVE ME EXCITEMENT, AND IT'S GONNA KEEP ME GOING. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? Zeke: YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU FINE. VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: SEVEN MILES TO THE EAST, AT THE MISS NOMER... I'M STILL SEEING REALLY, REALLY AWESOME GOLD EVERYWHERE I LOOK. THERE'S PUDDLES OF IT TRICKLING OVER THIS GRAVEL. Narrator: ...AFTER COLLECTING 31 OUNCES, WORTH MORE THAN $40,000, WHILE PARTNERED WITH ZEKE, GLEN LeBARON IS BACK ON THE GOLD. Glen: DREDGING ALONG THIS DARK, CLAY EDGE WHERE IT MEETS THE SAND, I'VE BEEN SEEING THE BEST GOLD. LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD IN THIS COURSE, TOO, 'CAUSE I JUST SAW A SMALL NUGGET GO IN THE TRACTION, THEN I SAW ANOTHER ONE ABOVE IT LATER. Narrator: ON THIN ICE ABOVE... I'M HERE. ...GLEN'S GIRLFRIEND, JASMIN GEORGE. Glen: YEAH, THE GOLD'S STILL LOOKING REALLY GOOD. IN FACT, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING EVEN BETTER. Jasmin: I'M TIRED. IT CAN GET STRESSFUL, 'CAUSE WE'RE JUST, LIKE, AT THE END OF THE ICE SEASON, AND WE'RE ALMOST OVER. WE'RE AT, LIKE, THE LAST STRETCH. Narrator: SINCE THE BREAKUP WITH ZEKE... ...JASMIN HAS STRUGGLED IN HER NEW ROLE AS FULL-TIME TENDER... GET UP THERE AND [BLEEP] CLOSE THAT. ...TRYING TO APPEASE THE SELF-PROCLAIMED "BEST DREDGER IN NOME." IT'S KIND OF BLACK AND GRAY, AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD IN THAT LITTLE BIT OF GRAVEL, SO WE'LL DEFINITELY DO WELL TODAY. I THINK THIS WILL BE THE PERFECT PLACE TO FINISH OFF THE SEASON. HELLO? I'M GLAD WE CHOSE TO DROP OFF THE DRAGON IN THE PERFECT SPOT. THAT'S AWESOME. YOU KNOW, IF IT'S SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE FOR YOU TO, LIKE, GO TO THE COM BOX, MAYBE YOU SHOULD MOVE IT CLOSER TO YOU. THEN, I DON'T HAVE TO, LIKE, FEEL BAD ABOUT TALKING. WHAT DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO IN THERE, JAS? DON'T SAY THAT TO ME. I DON'T HAVE A LOATHING, I HAVE TO TALK LOUD SINCE YOU CAN'T STAND MY HIGH-PITCHED, FAST VOICE. I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING RIGHT BY GLEN'S [BLEEP] STANDARDS. HE'S MAKING ME NOT WANT TO BE HERE. Narrator: EIGHT MILES WEST, ON THE TOMCOT CLAIM... I'M GOING OUT TO THE DREDGE, AND WE'RE ON A PRETTY GOOD SPOT. ...WITH JUST OVER 13 OUNCES, WORTH ALMOST 17 GRAND, COLLECTED ON THE SEASON, THE FIGHTING KELLYS ARE LOOKING TO FINISH STRONG. IT'S GONNA MAKE OUR SEASON RIGHT NOW. Kris: LOOK. HERE THEY ARE. BUT OUT AT THE DREDGE... POMRENKES ARE OVER AT OUR SPOT. THIS IS BULL[BLEEP] ...THEY'VE GOT COMPANY -- OH, HERE COME THE KELLY BOYS. Narrator: ...SHAWN POMRENKE AND THE SHAMROCK. THIS IS OUR AREA. PLUS, I'M GONNA START URINATING ALL OVER. WE'RE ONLY ABOUT 50, 60 YARDS FROM THEM, SO WHATEVER. IT'S ALWAYS TURF WARS. EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S THEIR SPOT, THEIR HOLE. Narrator: THIS ISN'T MR. GOLD'S FIRST RUN-IN ON THE ICE. THREE DAYS AGO... AAH! ...HE TOOK ON VERNON ADKISON IN THE WILD RANGER. KEEP HIM OFF OUR CHEESE. Shawn: I'VE BEEN MINING TOMCOT CLAIM FOR A LONG TIME. EVERYBODY'S COMING TO THE AREA WHERE I WAS MINING THE SUMMER. IT BURNS YOU A LITTLE BIT, BUT WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. WELL, MAN, WHAT'S THAT WAY? I DIDN'T THINK YOU GUYS WOULD MOVE INTO OUR LITTLE AREA HERE. Cody: SHAWN FOUND A SPOT THAT HE LIKED IN THE SUMMER THAT WE KIND OF LEFT BEHIND, SO... Narrator: NOW, WITH TIME RUNNING OUT ON THE SEASON, IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. IT'S LIKE, "SHAWN, HEY, AREN'T YOU MR. GOLD? SHOULDN'T YOU BE ABLE TO [BLEEP] SNAP YOUR FINGERS, AND YOU GOT GOLD EVERYWHERE?" HE'S GOT TO COME AND TRY TO GET OUR LITTLE BITS OF GOLD? I'VE BEEN OUT HERE IN THIS OCEAN FOR 15 YEARS NOW. THESE GUYS SHOW UP IN THE FIRST YEAR, AND THEY THINK THAT THIS IS THEIR SPOT. HE'S ON MY PROPERTY. THIS IS WHERE I MINE. THIS IS MY SPOT. WHAT THE [BLEEP] LOOK AT ALL THIS GROUND OUT HERE. HE'S GOT TO MOVE IN ON THE LITTLE GOLD GETTER? THE KELLYS -- THEY'RE BEGINNERS, SO YOU GOT TO GIVE IT TO THEM. THEY'RE ALL TRYING. ANY COMPETITION THERE? NO. THIS IS GETTING OLD FROM MR. GOLD. I DON'T LET THE SMALL [BLEEP] BOTHER ME. WE GOT AN EIGHT-INCH HOSE. THEY ONLY GOT A SIX. SO WE KNOW WHO WILL WIN THAT WAR. NOW IT'S A RACE TO GO AND GET IT BEFORE THE POMRENKE STEALS OUR GOLD. WHAT ARE YOU REALLY GONNA DO, MAN? I THINK THAT EXCAVATOR IS WORTH MORE THAN OUR WHOLE OPERATION. Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLAIM... WE'RE GETTING RIGHT DOWN TO THE TAIL END OF THE SEASON RIGHT NOW, AND WE KNOW WHAT WE GOT TO DO. WE GOT TO GET THE GOLD. Narrator: ...THE GOLD-COUNT LEADER... [ ENGINE REVS ] ...WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON, FIRING UP ON HIS SIXTH DIVE HOLE OF THE WINTER. RIGHT NOW, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO GET THE GOLD. WE JUST GOT TO TRY TO GET IT WHILE THE GETTING'S GOOD. IT'S WINTER SEASON. IT'S BEEN EXCITING, A LOT OF FUN, AND WE'RE GETTING GOOD GOLD. 116 OUNCES SO FAR. Narrator: WITH OVER $150,000 BANKED ALREADY, VERNON IS ON A MISSION TO SCORE 200 OUNCES BEFORE THE ICE GIVES OUT. IT'S SUNNY, IT'S WARM -- EVERYTHING WE DON'T WANT. THERE'S A LOT OF SURFACE WATER ON TOP OF THE ICE. WE'VE JUST GOT A FEW DAYS LEFT, AND WE NEED TO MAKE ANOTHER REALLY GOOD CLEANUP, MAYBE TWO. TIME TO GO DOWN AND MAKE US SOME MONEY. Narrator: FIRST DOWN ON THE HOLE, LEAD DIVER JUSTON COOK. Vernon: ALL RIGHT. GET US SOME GOLD. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. HOW DO YOU HEAR ME, JUSTON? ALL RIGHT. REAL GOOD. Juston: GOT ABOUT A GOOD FOOT OF COBBLE ON TOP, A NICE, LITTLE LAYER ABOVE THE HARD PAN. LET'S GO, BABY. YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH IT PRETTY NICE. SEE WHERE IT LEADS ME TO. I'M LOOKING FOR THAT BIG NUGGET. IT'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. IT'S CALLING MY NAME. OH, YEAH. GOLD! DAMN, THIS IS NICE. TRACKING SOME NICE GOLD. ALL RIGHT, WELL, KEEP SUCKING IT UP. DON'T FORGET HIS LITTLE BROTHERS. WE NEED TO MAKE THIS CLEANOUT A BIG ONE. LOOKING PRETTY GOOD DOWN HERE. WHAT A DAMN GOOD GOLD PATCH RIGHT HERE. IT'S JUST LOOKING LIKE THE YELLOW-BRICK ROAD. HE TAKES BIG BITES OUT OF THE GOLD. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE GUY'S A GOLD-GETTING SHARK. [ SCREAMS ] [ GROANS ] Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR, AT THE WILD RANGER... [ SCREAMS ] [ GROANS ] DAMN IT. KIND OF HURTING A LITTLE BIT. DAMN IT. [BLEEP] Vernon: IS IT BROKEN? I DON'T THINK IT'S BROKEN. I THINK IT'S JUST LAID OPEN. SHARP ROCK DOWN THERE? HOW'D YOU DO IT? YES [BLEEP] I WENT TO GET A JAM OFF A NOZZLE. ANOTHER ROCK COME IN BEHIND IT AND JUST SLAMMED MY FINGER UP IN THERE. OH, MY, I THINK IT NEEDS A STITCH OR TWO. I DON'T KNOW. WE ARE ON THE GOLD. AND TO GET UP TO 200 OUNCES, EVERYBODY'S GOT TO PULL THEIR WEIGHT. EVERY DAY WE'RE NOT DIVING, THAT'S GOLD THAT WE'RE NOT FINDING. Narrator: 84 OUNCES AWAY FROM HIS GOAL AND WITH HIS LEAD DIVER A BLOODY MESS, VERNON'S HOPE OF A 200-OUNCE SEASON IS ON THE ROCKS. [ GROANS ] DAMN. EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST, JUST OFF EAST BEACH... REALLY? [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] REALLY, SNOW MACHINE? YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS NOW? Narrator: ...WITH JUST ONE OUNCE OF GOLD COLLECTED FOR THE ENTIRE WINTER... NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS! Narrator: ...EROICA OWNER EMILY RIEDEL IS HEADED BACK TO WORK. [ SIGHS ] IT'S FLOODED. I FEEL LIKE I MADE A LOT OF WRONG DECISIONS FOR THIS ICE-MINING SEASON, AND I CHOSE THE WRONG TIME TO EXPERIMENT. [ SIGHS ] Narrator: FOR OVER A MONTH... Daryl: WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUCTION. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE POWER TO BLOW THE ROCKS OUT. Narrator: ...EMILY'S $50,000 INVESTMENT HAS BEEN RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS... Emily: THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CATCHING THE MAJORITY OF THE GOLD. Daryl: IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. ...AND IS FAILING TO RECOVER THE GOLD HER CREW HAS BEEN MINING. [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] IN SPITE OF ALL THE OBSTACLES AND THE LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS, I DO HAVE A LOT OF WILLPOWER TO SUCCEED. EVERY DAY SEEMS LIKE THE LAST DAY WE COULD BE OUT HERE SAFELY. WE MIGHT LOSE EVERYTHING, BUT WE'RE GONNA STAY. THAT IS THE KIND OF DEVOTION I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO HAVE IF I'M EVER GONNA MAKE MONEY UP HERE. Narrator: WITH THE ICE QUICKLY MELTING, HER ONLY CHOICE IS TO DIVE UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT. Emily: I WANT TO SUCCEED. I WANT TO MAKE A LOT OF GOLD. AND I'M GONNA CRAWL BACK FROM THIS TERRIBLE ICE-MINING SEASON. OH! OH [BLEEP] Narrator: BUT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT MAY BE COMING SOONER THAN EXPECTED. Tony: THE LEAD'S OPENED. AND SEE HOW THIS [BLEEP] GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE SHORE AND ALL THE WAY THAT WAY? Emily: THIS IS BAD. THE ICE HAS ROTTED THROUGH. THIS IS THE FIRST LEAD. THIS IS ALL GONNA BE GONE. Narrator: THE FIRST SIGN OF THE SUMMER MELT ARE LEADS DIVIDING THE SHORE-FAST ICE FROM THE LARGER PACK. ONCE THESE FISSURES APPEAR, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE ICE BREAKS LOOSE AND HEADS OUT TO SEA. WE PROBABLY NEED TO PULL THE ICE SHACK ON THIS SIDE OF THE LEAD IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO STICK AROUND, 'CAUSE THIS WILL PROBABLY OPEN UP TONIGHT. SEE IF IT FLOATS? WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT DECISION BETWEEN WANTING TO STAY AND TRY TO SALVAGE THE SEASON AND WANTING TO GET OFF SO I CAN SALVAGE MY EQUIPMENT. IT'S TIME TO MOVE. I'VE ALREADY LOST SO MUCH ON THIS ICE OPERATION, I CAN'T LOSE ANY MORE BY LOSING MY EQUIPMENT, AS WELL. AGREED. THIS IS A MOVE FROM POINT "A" TO POINT "B," WHICH IS 200 FEET THAT WAY. ICE IS GONNA BE MORE SOLID THERE. Narrator: TO KEEP WORKING, EMILY MAKES THE CALL TO MOVE HER DREDGE 100 FEET NORTH TO THE SHORE-FAST ICE. ON A DAILY BASIS, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET HOWEVER MANY OUNCES WE THINK WE CAN POSSIBLY ACCUMULATE BEFORE THE SEASON IS OVER. YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON PERSEVERING UNTIL WE FIND GOLD. GOT EVERYTHING PRETTY TIDY AND READY TO GO. NOTHING THAT A REDNECK AND HIS FOUR-WHEELER CAN'T DO. [ CLICKS TONGUE ] GO, GO, GO, GO! WHAT THE [BLEEP] GO, MAN, GO! KEEP GOING! DON'T STOP! YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] NOW WE'RE CLEAR. WELL, WE'RE CLEAR FROM THE PRESSURE ZONE. Tony: BETTER TELL GLEN, 'CAUSE I STILL SEE HIM OVER THERE, DREDGING AWAY. YEAH, HE'S ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LEAD. HE'S ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LEAD. YEAH, GO HOLLER AT GLEN. LET HIM KNOW WHAT'S UP. AT LEAST HIS DREDGE FLOATS. Narrator: 200 YARDS SOUTH OF THE NEWLY FORMED LEAD... AFTER FOUR HOURS OF ICY RADIO SILENCE... HEY, JAS, ARE YOU THERE? I'M HERE. ...A TEMPORARY TRUCE HAS BEEN CALLED. YEAH, I FORGIVE YOU. 'CAUSE HE WAS JUST SAYING IT OUT OF ANGER. HE WAS BEING ANNOYED, AND HE WAS ANGERED, AND HE WAS SAYING THINGS THAT HE WOULDN'T NORMALLY SAY. SO, WHAT I NEED TO WORK ON WAS MEMORIZING THINGS BETTER AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR HIM BY MEMORIZING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND JUST BEING MORE HELPFUL. WHERE'S THE COM BOX. LET GLEN KNOW. YOU GUYS CAN COME CHECK IT OUT INSIDE. Emily: OH, MAN, NICE HOME YOU HAVE. HEY, GLEN... YEAH, YEAH. WHAT UP? ...I'M GIVING YOU A HEADS-UP. THERE'S A LEAD OPENING UP DIRECTLY IN FRONT YOU. [BLEEP] I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE. SOUNDS GOOD. IS HE COMING OUT? YEAH, HE'S COMING OUT. I'M GONNA CHECK OUT THE ICE BREAKER WITH TONY. COME ON, GLEN. OH [BLEEP] WHERE'D THAT CRACK COME FROM? WHOA. OH, MAN. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S [BLEEP] CRACKING THAT WAY AND THAT WAY? Glen: WHAT SUCKS IS I'M ON THE BEST GOLD I'VE FOUND THIS SEASON. DON'T GO CHASING ANOTHER DRAGON AROUND ALL SUMMER. WELL -- COME ON, NOW. COME ON. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO. I HATE PUTTING ALL MY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT AT RISK, BUT THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA GET THE MOST GOLD. THAT'S JUST THE REALITY OF THIS BUSINESS. I'M GONNA KEEP DREDGING. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ICE. HEY, DO YOU HAVE A FLARE GUN THAT YOU CAN SHOOT UP, JUST IN CASE THE [BLEEP] HITS THE FAN? NO, BUT -- "TONY, COME SAVE ME." PSSH! NO, BUT I YELL PRETTY LOUD. OKAY. BE CAREFUL. Glen: THE ICE IS BREAKING UP. IT'S MELTING. BUT I'M FINDING THE BEST GOLD THAT I FOUND SO FAR, AND I'M NOT LEAVING HERE UNTIL I PUT A LOT OF GOLD IN THE DRAGON. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, AT THE CLARK... HOW IS IT LOOKING DOWN THERE? ...AFTER DROPPING FOUR GRAND TO SET OUT ON HIS OWN, ZEKE TENHOFF'S FIRST DIVE ON NEW GROUNDS... Zeke: I KNOW THERE'S GOLD SOMEWHERE IN THE AREA, BUT I'M NOT FINDING ANY. ...HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT FRUSTRATION. NOBODY EVER SAID GOLD WAS EASY TO FIND. I MEAN, ALL THE CONDITIONS KIND OF LOOK LIKE IT SHOULD BE HERE, BUT I'M JUST NOT SEEING IT IN THIS SPOT. IT'S GOT TO BE OUT HERE. WE JUST HAVE TO FIND IT. Sarah: ZEKE NEEDS TO MAKE MONEY THIS ICE SEASON. HE NEEDS TO PUT TOGETHER A SUMMER OPERATION. THE SMALL AMOUNT THAT HE'S GOTTEN SO FAR, ZEKE PUT IT BACK INTO ICE DREDGING, SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE REALLY PUSHING IT. MY INTUITION TELLS ME THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME GOLD OFF IN THAT DIRECTION, BUT YEAH, I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOSE ON THIS THING. MY REACH ISN'T LONG ENOUGH. HEY, SARAH, I'M GONNA WANDER OVER IN THAT DIRECTION OVER THERE WITHOUT THE HOSE AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'VE GOT TO BE GETTING CLOSE. WHOA, LOOK AT THIS [BLEEP] HEY, THERE'S A BIG ROCK WALL OVER HERE, AND I THINK IT'S OVER BY THE PRESSURE RIDGE. WHAT?! THIS ROCK WALL -- IT'S LIKE A REEF, AND IT'S SHUTTING OUT SORT OF NORTH/SOUTH. IT'S LIKE AN OBSTRUCTION. AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BECAUSE A LOT OF GOLD SETTLES AROUND HERE OVER BY THE PRESSURE RIDGE. YOU KNOW, LIKE, ANYTHING THAT'S, LIKE, MOVING ALONG THE OCEAN FLOOR, AND IT'S GONNA GET STUCK IN THIS ONE PLACE. ARE WE GONNA BE RICH? SARAH, THIS COULD BE OPTIMAL GROUND. THIS IS REALLY AWESOME. OH, BABY, THAT'S AWESOME. PLACE IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED. I KNOW. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED. ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING UP. SOUNDS GOOD, BABY, I'LL SEE YOU ON TOP. ZEKE SOUNDS THRILLED. I TRY NOT TO GET MY HOPES UP TOO MUCH, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, I AM PRETTY HOPEFUL. WE JUST NEED TO GO DOWN AND GET A LONGER PIECE OF HOSE. THAT PRESSURE RIDGE RIGHT THERE -- THAT'S BASICALLY JUST A [BLEEP] ROCK WALL THAT GOES THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THIS LEASE. AND, THEN, OUT HERE, THERE'S JUST, LIKE, SCATTERED ROCKS AND A LOT OF EXPOSED CLAY AND JUST A LOT OF REALLY RICH GOLD. Zeke: I'M REALLY GLAD THAT I LED MYSELF OVER INTO THIS AREA, 'CAUSE IT'S THIS LITTLE TRANSITION AREA BETWEEN WHATEVER. IT'S A SAND FIELD THAT KIND OF BUTTS UP AGAINST THIS BOULDER WALL. I THINK THE GOLD'S GONNA BE REALLY GOOD. JUST A LITTLE WAYS OUT OF THE REACH OF MY HOSE. Narrator: AS IT'S BEEN FOR EVERY GOLD MINER IN HISTORY, THE REALLY GOOD GROUND IS JUST OUT OF REACH. RATHER THAN MOVE HIS ENTIRE OPERATION, ZEKE'S HEADED FOR TOWN AND A LONGER SUCTION HOSE. I'M GONNA WEAR MYSELF THE HELL OUT BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE HAVE TO PULL OFF THE ICE, BECAUSE I NEED THAT GOLD. ONE MILE TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOT CLAIM... Brad: THE UNDERDOG -- OUR $2,500 MOTOR AGAINST THEIR $70,000 MOTOR. THE RACE IS ON. ...WITH THE BIG, BAD SHAMROCK CLOSE ENOUGH TO HIT WITH A SLINGSHOT, THE KELLYS ARE PLAYING DAVID TO THE POMRENKE GOLIATH. I FEEL THAT I'M LOSING OUT ON THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A DAY BY NOT HAVING THE PROPER SYSTEM RUNNING RIGHT NOW. THE AREA THAT WE'RE WORKING -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOLD EVERYWHERE. ANYBODY CAN GET GOLD OUT THERE, EVEN STEVE RIEDEL, IF HE TRIED. BUT REALLY, THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE HAVE IS JUST A LACK OF A GREAT OPERATION. MY MASK IS ALREADY FOGGING UP. [BLEEP] DON'T BREAK THE [BLEEP] MASK, YOU [BLEEP] IDIOT. PUT IT ON, AND IT'S ALREADY FOGGING UP! NOTHING, NOTHING. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. Brad: THE KIDS OFTEN ACCUSE ME OF RUNNING WITH SECOND-RATE EQUIPMENT, BUT IT SAYS BRAD KELLY ON THE TITLE, NOT KRIS OR ANDY. EVEN AT THE LITTLE [BLEEP] OUNCE, OUNCE AND A QUARTER-OUNCE AND A HALF CLEANOUT A DAY, 'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT DIVING THAT MUCH, I'M STILL BANKING 4,200 BUCKS A WEEK. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IN ESSENCE, THE KIDS DON'T SIT AROUND AND DO THE MATH. Narrator: DESPITE A CHEAPER OPERATION AND GEAR... ...KRIS KELLY IS FIRST INTO THE WATER. YOU WANT TO MAKE IT IN THIS BUSINESS, WE GOT TO GET A LOT OF GOLD. WE'RE WORKING AGAINST A LOT OF BIG-MONEY COMPETITION. Kris: I'D SAY AT LEAST A THIRD OF AN OUNCE AN HOUR RIGHT NOW. THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA KEEP GETTING A LOT OF GOLD IS JUST CLEARING OUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF AREA. Narrator: OVER ON THE SHAMROCK... ...MR. GOLD IS HEADED FOR THE VERY SAME PASTRY. THE KELLYS -- IT SEEMS LIKE THEY GOT A LITTLE TOO MANY FAMILY ISSUES TO REALLY FOCUS ON MINING. THEY'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING, AND YOU SEE THEM OUT ON THE ICE, YELLING AND SCREAMING, AND IT'S KIND OF COMICAL. BETTER THEM THAN ME. WE WILL ANNIHILATE AN AREA IN NO TIME. WE NEED A BIG PATCH WITH LOTS OF GOLD TO KEEP US GOING. WHAT WOULD TAKE THESE OTHER CREWS A WEEK OR ALL SEASON, WE'LL DO IN A FEW DAYS. WE'RE WITHIN SPITTING DISTANCE FROM THE KELLY BOYS. GO, SHAWN, GO. Narrator: WITH GOLD-RICH GROUND UP FOR GRABS, IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME. KRIS, HOW'S IT GOING? HALLELUJAH. WE NEED THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING. WE GET THREE OUNCES TODAY, I'LL BE A HAPPY SON OF A GUN. WHERE ELSE CAN YOU GO AND MAKE FIVE GRAND A DAY KIND OF SITTING AROUND, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU? Kris: BUT I GO LEFT, I GO RIGHT. EVERY TIME I DO, I'M MAKING MONEY. IT'S KA-CHING, KA-CHING! KA-CHING! AND THEN YOU GRIND IT ACROSS, AND YOU FEEL THAT MONEY AS YOU MAKE IT. GOING UP, KA-CHING. GO ALONG, KA-CHING. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE UPDATE? WE'RE ALL HOPING THAT SHAWN GETS DOWN IN THIS NEW HOLE AND SEES SOMETHING. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH. YEAH! [ Spanish accent ] FIRST, YOU GET THE RICHES, THEN YOU GET THE WOMEN! Narrator: SEVEN MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR, ON THE TOMCOT CLAIM. Shawn: NOW THAT'S SOME KA-CHING ACTION RIGHT THERE. KA-CHING, KA-CHING. Narrator: THE KELLY BOYS AND THEIR RINKY-DINK DREDGE ARE RACING TO KEEP UP WITH MR. GOLD. OUR OPERATION -- I MEAN, DUDE, IT'S LIKE 10 TIMES MORE WORK, UNLESS WE GO OUT AND SPEND A HUNDRED GRAND LIKE SHAWN. Shawn: YEAH! GETTING SOME GOLD, MAKING SOME MONEY! Narrator: SHAWN POMRENKE, WITH A STRONGER PUMP ENGINE AND LARGER HOSE, CAN COVER GROUND TWICE AS FAST. I DON'T HEAR NO MORE "KA-CHING." WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU LOSE IT? Kris: IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE THERE'S A ROCK JAM. YEAH, THERE'S A ROCK JAM. POKE THE BOX. Brad: NOPE. IT'S IN THE HOSE. IT'S NOT IN THE BOX. WELL, THIS SUCKS! GET THE SLEDGEHAMMER. ALL RIGHT, LET ME LOOK AND SEE WHERE THIS IS. THERE'S A FLAT ROCK RIGHT HERE. [BLEEP] DAMN [BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP] I THINK HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WOMAN AT BIRTH AND THE DNA GOT SPLIT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [BLEEP] 'CAUSE HE SURE COMPLAINS LIKE A LITTLE GIRL HALF THE TIME. HE FORGETS WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO -- GET GOLD. AND WHEN I WAS A KID, I BUSTED MY ASS. THESE KIDS TODAY -- MAN, THEY'RE LAZY-ASS BASTARDS. GIVE ME A WHIP OR CANE OR SOMETHING, AND LET ME TAKE IT TO THEM. BECAUSE TODAY, THERE'S SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT ABUSE TO KIDS AND [BLEEP] THAT'S FOR ALL THESE KIDS IN AMERICA. GIVE THEM A GOOD RIGHT HAND OR A BELT, MAN, THEY'LL START MOVING A LITTLE FASTER. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: JUST 300 YARDS AWAY, AT THE WILD RANGER... Vernon: SO, LET ME SEE THAT FINGER THERE. YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE BEST DOCTORING IS SELF-DOCTORING. ...PUSHING HARD FOR A 200-OUNCE SEASON... WE'LL JUST GET THE BLEEDING STOPPED, TRY TO SEAL IT UP SO I CAN GO DIVING. ...VERNON AND HIS LEAD DIVER ARE APPLYING AN OLD REMEDY. I MEAN, KRAZY GLUE WILL PROBABLY KILL ANY GERM THAT'S IN THERE. THERE AIN'T MUCH [BLEEP] THAT HAPPENS OUT HERE THAT WE CAN'T FIX, RIGHT? RIGHT, EVEN OURSELVES. MAYBE IT WILL HOLD FOR THE DURATION OF THE DIVE. IT'S ONLY GOT TO LAST ABOUT SIX HOURS. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. I THINK IT WILL WORK. LET'S GO MAKE SOME MONEY. ALL RIGHT. GET ON THAT GOLD. BACK TO MAKING MONEY! Vernon: JUSTON IS ONE TOUGH NUT. YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH JUSTON, I TELL YOU. YEAH, WE GLUED IT, SCREWED IT, AND TAPED IT! HE OUGHT TO BE GOOD TO GO. Narrator: SUPER-GLUED, DUCT-TAPED, AND READY FOR ACTION, JUSTON IS GEARED UP TO PUT GOLD BACK IN THE BOX. Vernon: GET AFTER THAT GOLD, BUDDY. Juston: YEAH! FINALLY, AFTER THREE OR FOUR YEARS UP HERE, I'VE GOTTEN A GOOD TEAM, PROBABLY THE BEST IN TOWN. WE'LL GET MORE GOLD THAN ANYBODY ELSE AROUND HERE THIS WINTER. Narrator: ACROSS THE FLEET... AS LATE AS IT IS IN THE SEASON, IT STILL DOES NOT MEAN THAT I CAN'T GET INTO SOMETHING GOOD. ...THE FINAL PUSH FOR GOLD IS UNDER WAY. Sarah: ALL RIGHT, GOLD HOUNDS. COULD BE THE LAST DIVE OF THE SEASON, SO GO DOWN THERE... Narrator: AS THE SPRING MELT STARTS FRACTURING THE ICE, EVERY DIVE COULD BE THEIR LAST. FOUND A NICE NUGGET DOWN THERE. ICE-MINING IS A RISKY, RISKY BUSINESS. ONCE THE ICE TURNS BLACK, GET THE HELL OFF, BECAUSE IT AIN'T GONNA BE LONG BEFORE IT'S GONE. Narrator: BUT FOR ONE MINER, THE END MAY HAVE ALREADY COME. JUST OFF EAST BEACH... Glen: WE DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, BUT A LEAD HAS OPENED, AND THE MISS NOMER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. THE MISS NOMER'S FLOATING OUT TO SEA, AND IT'S DRAGGING THE DRAGON WITH IT, AND WE HAVE TO GO SAVE IT. Narrator: ...AFTER IGNORING THE WARNING SIGNS, GLEN LeBARON IS PAYING THE PRICE. Glen: WE JUST CROSSED THIS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, AND THERE WAS NO GAP AN HOUR AGO. NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S ALMOST A QUARTER-MILE GAP. Narrator: THE LEAD HAS BROKEN WIDE-OPEN, TAKING THE MISS NOMER PLATFORM AND THE SHEET OF ICE IT SITS ON OUT TO SEA. Glen: THE DRAGON HAS ALREADY BEEN DRAGGED AT LEAST 200 FEET, AND THE ONLY THING THAT'S HOLDING IT IS THE ROPE. LET'S JUST HOPE THAT THAT ROPE IS STILL ATTACHED TO THE MISS NOMER. Narrator: MAKING MATTERS WORSE, GLEN'S UNDERWATER DREDGE, THE DRAGON, IS BEING DESTROYED AS IT'S DRAGGED ALONG THE ROCKY SEA FLOOR. Glen: WE ARE A RESCUE MISSION. Narrator: TO SAVE IT, GLEN AND JASMIN PLAN TO TAKE A TINY, RUBBER RAFT OUT INTO THE 28-DEGREE WATER. AND HEADED FOR A SEA LITTERED WITH JAGGED ICE, THE BOAT HAS ALREADY SPRUNG A LEAK. SO, THIS IS [BLEEP] CRAZY. Glen: WE'VE GOT A BOAT WITH A HOLE IN IT, AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ROW ACROSS THIS HALF-MILE GAP AND GET THE DRAGON OFF THE BOTTOM. THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THE MISS NOMER TO SHORE. GUYS, I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE HERE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO. WE CAN ALL FIT IN HERE. NO, WE CAN'T. WITH THE FRONT DEFLATED, JAS, I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS. Glen: [BLEEP] GOT TO GO. I'M WAITING ON SHORE FOR YOU GUYS. OKAY. WE GOT A PHONE. THE BEST DREDGER IN NOME IS... MR. GOLD. THE BEST DREDGER IN NOME IS THE GUY WHO CAN GET THE MOST GOLD WITH THE SMALLEST INVESTMENT. TELL YOU WHO IT'S NOT IS THE GUYS WHO PURPORT THEMSELVES TO BE THE BEST DREDGERS IN NOME. I MEAN, YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF THE BEST DREDGER IN NOME, AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE BEST DREDGER IN NOME IS DEFINITELY ME. GLEN LeBARON, UNDOUBTEDLY. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SAY IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE, HE REALLY IS. IF YOU'RE WHERE I WAS AT 10 YEARS AGO, YOU'RE NOT THE BEST DREDGER. THE BEST DREDGER IN NOME IS THE MOST SILENT. Narrator: ON THE COAST OF NOME... Man: LIKE, YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE SHORE BROKE OFF RIGHT HERE. I MEAN, THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE GAP. Narrator: ...THE BERING SEA ICE PACK HAS BEGUN TO BREAK APART. Man: THIS WAS SOLID ICE AN HOUR AGO, AND IT'S JUST CRAZY. THIS IS THE RISK THESE GUYS TAKE OUT HERE IN THE BERING SEA. I MEAN, YOU JUST NEVER KNOW. I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S STABLE GROUND, BUT YOU JUST HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDERNEATH YOU. Narrator: WITH THEIR OPERATION FLOATING AWAY ON A SHEET OF ICE, GLEN AND JASMIN HAVE LEFT THEIR CAMERAMAN BEHIND WHILE THEY ROW OUT TO ATTEMPT A RESCUE. THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY RIGHT NOW. THIS IS PRETTY MUCH AS REAL AS IT GETS. AND WE'RE JUST GONNA WAIT OUT HERE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YEAH, THERE'S THE HEADLAMPS IN THE DISTANCE, WAY OUT THERE. ARRIVED AT THE MISS NOMER PLATFORM, THE TWO BEGIN TO DOCUMENT THE EVENTS ON JASMIN'S PERSONAL CAMERA. ARE YOU GUYS DRIFTING RIGHT NOW? Glen: YEAH, WE'RE DRIFTING FOR SURE. THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHEN WE GOT OUT HERE. WE WERE WALKING THROUGH A FROZEN LAKE ON THE ICE, AND OUR BOOTS WEREN'T TALL ENOUGH. SO, YEAH, LET ME GIVE YOU A REPORT IN FIVE MINUTES. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A REPORT THAT WE'RE DRIFTING OUT TO SEA FOR CERTAIN. AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF OUR CELL SIGNAL IS GONNA LAST LONG, SO THIS MAY GO INTO A MORE EXTENSIVE RESCUE, INCLUDING OURSELVES. ALL RIGHT, STAY SAFE OUT THERE. [ BEEPING ] Narrator: FOR GLEN, THE CHIEF CONCERN NOW IS PREVENTING FURTHER DAMAGE TO HIS UNDERWATER DREDGE. I'M ABOUT TO DIVE DOWN AND FLOAT THE DRAGON TO THE SURFACE. AS SOON AS WE DO THAT, WE'RE RACING BACK TO THE SKIFF, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE IT ACROSS THE LEAD BEFORE IT GETS TOO WIDE. Narrator: ATTACHED TO THE DRIFTING MISS NOMER BY A CONNECTING LINE, GLEN'S SUBMERSIBLE DREDGE IS DRAGGING ACROSS THE ROCKY SEAFLOOR. TO SAVE IT FROM DAMAGE, GLEN MUST RAISE THE DRAGON TO JUST BELOW THE FLOATING ICE SHEET. Jasmin: YOU KNOW, WE'RE DRIFTING NOW. IT'S PROBABLY LIKE MIDNIGHT BY NOW, AND WE JUST WENT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO. WE JUST FINISHED OUR SHIFT, AND WE DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN TONIGHT, BUT IT'S HAPPENING, AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A BIG RISK THAT WE'RE TAKING, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S PART OF GOLD MINING. Narrator: AFTER 40 MINUTES ON THE BOTTOM... IT'S UP. I JUST PULLED THE DRAGON. I WENT DOWN THERE AND EMPTIED OUT ITS BALLAST BAG. I TOOK ALL OF THE ROCKS OUT OF THE BALLAST BAG, FLOATED THE DRAGON UP, DRAGGED IT BY A ROPE. IT'S IN THE DIVE HOLE, AND NOW JAS AND I JUST HAVE TO RACE BACK. Man: THEY'RE OUT THERE, AND THEY'RE DRIFTING. I JUST HOPE IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. AFTER A THREE-HOUR ORDEAL AND FIGHTING FROSTBITE, GLEN, JASMIN, AND A HALF-SUNKEN RAFT FINALLY APPROACH THE COASTLINE. THIS IS FREAKING CRAZY. Glen: LET'S GET JAS OFF FIRST. BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE MISS NOMER, BOTH JAS AND I'S FEET WERE COMPLETELY FROZEN. WE HAD JUST ENOUGH FUEL FOR ME TO DIVE DOWN, FLOAT THE DRAGON TO THE SURFACE. YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST A REALLY CLOSE CALL, AND IT'S NOT OVER WITH. THIS IS LIKE HALF A SUCCESS -- YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOT EVEN A SUCCESS YET. THE FACT IS, HOPEFULLY THE TIDE BRINGS THIS ICE BACK IN AND WE CAN EASILY GET THE MISS NOMER OFF TOMORROW. Narrator: WITH THE DRAGON SECURED, GLEN IS COUNTING ON THE TIDE TO BRING THE ICE SHEET CLOSER TO SHORE. ONLY THEN CAN HE DRAG THE WHOLE OPERATION ONTO DRY LAND. THAT WAS LIKE THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME. Narrator: AS THE SEASON DRAWS TO A CLOSE, EVERY MOMENT SPENT MINING IS PRECIOUS. FOR NOW, CLEANUPS WILL HAVE TO WAIT. Man: LAST DIVE OF THE SEASON, MAN. OW! MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS! YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOME! YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE NOME! Daryl: WHOA. THE BUILDING JUST SHIFTED, DIDN'T IT? Shawn: WE'RE ALREADY ON THIN ICE. NOT GOOD. OH! [BLEEP] DAMN IT!
