 [ SEAL GRUNTS ] ♪ Narrator: 100 MILES EAST OF NOME... AT THE BLUFF... EITHER I GOT A LOT FATTER, OR THE SUIT GOT TIGHTER. HOPEFULLY I'M SEEIN' GOLD ON THE BOTTOM. HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE TO PICK UP EVERYTHING AND MOVE IT. ...CAPTAIN SHAWN POMRENKE IS SUITING UP... -HERE WE GO. -FOR ONE MORE SHOT AT GLORY. THIS STATION'S RUNNING HIGH TO FIND SOME GOLD. WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKIN' OUR ASSES OFF, SO WE DESERVE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR. HOPEFULLY TODAY IS THE DAY. Narrator: THIS WINTER, SHAWN STAKED NEARLY 30 GRAND OF FAMILY MONEY ON THE CHANCE OF HITTING IT BIG IN THE WILD. IT'S A SIGN THERE'S GOLD IN THE AREA. Narrator: BUT SETBACK... WE'VE ALREADY BURNED [BLEEP] 200 GALLONS OF GAS ALMOST. ...AFTER SETBACK HAS KEPT HIM FROM THE MOTHER LODE. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE OUT HERE. SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME WE TURN AROUND, SOMETHING ELSE IS BREAKIN' OR GOING WRONG. Narrator: NOW, HE'S GOT JUST 11 DAYS TO PROVE THE TRIP WASN'T A WASTE. OH, [BLEEP]. THAT GUY'S FLYIN' REALLY LOW. WHOO-HOO! WHOA-HO-HO! WE JUST GOT BUZZED! WHO IN THE HELL'S THAT? HE'S COMIN' IN TO LAND. WHOA! THAT'S GNARLY, DUDE, THAT WIND AND THE BUMPS. WHOO-HOO. -WE MADE IT. -IT'S THE OLD MAN. OH, NO. ANYTHING GETTIN' DONE AROUND HERE? Narrator: NEVER ONE TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES, SHAWN'S FATHER AND CO-OWNER OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS, STEVE POMRENKE. SOMEBODY'S GOTTA KEEP YOU GUYS IN LINE. GOT ANY GOLD YET OR NOT? I BROUGHT MY SUITCASE AND MY DOWSING RODS. THAT'S A PRETTY SUITCASE YOU GOT THERE. YEAH, PRETTY ROSY, AIN'T IT? 'CAUSE I'M TRYIN' TO BE TENDER, NOT SO ROUGH AND GRUFF. -Narrator: FOR SHAWN... -IF YOU [BLEEP] TALK TO ME LIKE [BLEEP] HUMAN BEING, IT MIGHT [BLEEP] WORK. ...PLEASING THE OLD MAN HAS BEEN A CONSTANT STRUGGLE. I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE TALKING [BLEEP] ABOUT ME TO OTHER PEOPLE. BECAUSE YOU GIVE US SO MUCH AMMUNITION. Narrator: NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE RAKES IN... THAT'S 10 POUNDS OF GOLD RIGHT THERE. WE BETTER GET A HELL OF A LOT MORE. COME ON. ...IT NEVER SEEMS TO BE QUITE ENOUGH... DON'T NEED YOU TO RUN THE CHRISTINE ROSE. YOU THINK WE NEED YOU THAT BAD? ...LEAVING FATHER AND SON WITH A LOT OF BAGGAGE. WELL, YEAH, SHAWN. WHAT DO WE GOT INVESTED IN THIS WHOLE TRIP SO FAR? -WE'RE PROBABLY 30 GRAND. -30 GRAND? I HOPE WE GET SOME OF THIS MONEY BACK. I KNOW THESE GUYS. AND WHEN THEY GET TOGETHER AND GO OUT SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, IT JUST TURNS INTO A BIG PARTY. YOU KNOW, I'M LOOKIN' AT THE CHECKBOOK AND WHAT SHAWN'S SPENDING ON THIS HERE BLUFF TRIP, AND BY GOD, THEY SHOULD COME BACK WITH 30 OUNCES TO PAY FOR THE TRIP. GET YOUR ASS DOWN THERE AND GET SOME GOLD UP HERE. DAD SHOWED UP. NOW THE PRESSURE'S ON TO FIND THE GOLD AND SHOW HIM THAT, HEY, THERE'S ACTUALLY A TON OF GOLD DOWN HERE. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S DOWN HERE. Narrator: AS SHAWN LOOKS TO IMPRESS HIS POPS... ...100 MILES TO THE WEST, OFF THE COAST OF NOME... THIS'LL BE OUR FINAL PUSH. WE MAY NOT HAVE TIME TO DO ANOTHER HOLE. Narrator: WITH JUST 11 DAYS REMAINING TO MAKE A PROFIT, WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON IS FEELING THE PINCH. EVERYBODY'S MOVING AROUND HERE AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. Narrator: THIS SEASON... COME MEET YOUR COMPETITION. ...VERNON ROLLED THE DICE, SPENDING $100,000, BRINGING TO TOWN A STATE-OF-THE-ART SUB-DREDGE. SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING LODGED. UH, TAKE A TIME-OUT REAL QUICK. BUT EVEN AFTER WORKING OUT THE KINKS... ALL RIGHT, 7.25. ...THEY'VE ONLY RECOVERED $11,000 IN GOLD. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. NOW I WANNA GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING SOME SERIOUS GOLD WITH IT. Narrator: NOW, ON A FRESH DIVE HOLE, THE SKIPPER NEEDS THIS NEW SPOT TO LAST HIM THE SEASON. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING MECHANICALLY WE CAN DO TO MAKE THIS THING MAKE MONEY. BUT I NEED GOOD EYES DOWN THERE. Narrator: FOR CREW CHIEF DEREK McLARTY, THE SUB-DREDGE HAS ONE BIG BLIND SPOT. YOU ONLY GET AS MUCH GOLD AS YOU FIND. IT'S LIKE HAVING A REALLY NICE SET OF SHOELACES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SHOES. THAT ROBOT CAN'T SEE GOLD. IT CAN'T PROSPECT. SO PUT A GOOD PROSPECTOR DOWN, FIND GOLD, HIT IT WITH THE ROBOT. CUT AND DRY. AS FAR AS SPENSER GOES IN PROSPECTING, I'D PUT HIM UP AGAINST ANYBODY. IS THERE ANY CHANCE I COULD GET, SAY, SPENSER TO DO SOME PROSPECTING DOWN THERE? I KNOW BOBBY'S A WORKHORSE. BUT, MAN, THAT SPENSER -- HE CAN SEE THAT GOLD REAL WELL. YEAH, I KNOW HE IS A GOOD PROSPECTOR. SO, UH, THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES, AND HOPEFULLY PRETTY DAMN QUICK. Narrator: HEADING DOWN TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ON PAY DIRT, VETERAN MINER SPENSER McCLESKEY. I'VE BEEN DREDGING SINCE I WAS ABOUT 12 YEARS OLD. MY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY, MY PARENTS BOUGHT ME A GOLD PAN AND A SLUICE BOX. AND I USED TO MOW THE NEIGHBOR'S LAWN AND GIVE MY MOM GAS MONEY TO TAKE ME TO THE RIVER TO GO GET GOLD. THIS IS WHAT I WAS BORN AND RAISED TO DO. Derek: JUST PROSPECT IT OUT. DON'T TRY TO WORK A BUNCH OF MATERIAL. IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING AND SEND UP DUCTS OR JUST SOMETHING SO YOU KNOW WHERE THE ROBOT CAN GO, MAYBE WE CAN WIPE THIS HOLE OUT IN A DAY OR TWO INSTEAD OF... A-A WEEK. -GET SOME. -YEAH! ALL RIGHT. I JUST HIT THE BOTTOM. I'M, UH, HEADIN' TOWARDS THE NOZZLE. I'M GONNA START DOIN' SOME PROSPECTIN'. ALL RIGHT... YEAH, I'M SOUTH OF THE HOLE NOW. WORKING INTO THIS COBBLE. HEY, SPENSER, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING UNDER THERE? WELL, I'M, UH, NOT REALLY SEEIN' MUCH GOLD YET. BUT I'M GONNA KEEP, UH, POPPIN' AROUND SEEING WHAT I CAN SEE, TRYING TO FIND THIS PAY STREAK SO WE CAN ALL MAKE SOME MONEY. Narrator: WHILE SPENSER STARTS THE HUNT... JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY, AT THE PADDY WAGON... MY BROTHER'S A [BLEEP] WEIRDO. HE GOES BACK AND WORKS WITH MY DAD RATHER THAN TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK WITH HIM AND I. HE'S GOT NO LOYALTY TO ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF. Narrator: ONCE AGAIN, THE HOUSE OF KELLY IS DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF. HE KINDA REALLY PISSED ME OFF. [BLEEP] LET HIM STAY WITH MY DAD. I DON'T NEED THAT [BLEEP] LOSER ANYWAYS. Narrator: A WEEK AGO... I MEAN, I CAME HERE TO DREDGE AND NOT BUILD DREDGES. ...AFTER KRIS' DREDGE BROKE DOWN... I'LL DO IT MYSELF, YOU [BLEEP] IDIOT! OKAY. OKAY! ...ANDY RETURNED TO WORK FOR THE OLD MAN. GOOD TO BE BACK AT THE REEFER WHERE I BELONG. ...TAKING THE QUICKEST ROUTE... TO A VERY SMALL PAYDAY. NOW WITH THE TWO DREDGES SIDE-BY-SIDE... ANDY, YOU GET ALL THIS GOLD BEFORE KRIS DOES. IT'S EVERY KELLY FOR HIMSELF. I GOT ANDY BACK NOW. THERE'S ONE DOWN. I GOT ONE LEFT TO GO. CAPTAIN KRIS -- YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE A [BLEEP] CEREAL YOU'RE GONNA EAT. LITTLE GOLD FLAVORED NUGGETS IN YOUR CEREAL -- CAPTAIN KRIS. GOIN' DOWN. GROUND FLOOR -- CHILDREN'S TOYS, SANTA CLAUS, SPORTS WEAR. THIS RIGHT HERE IS REALLY WHERE I WANNA WORK. LOOSE MATERIAL, EASY TO MOVE. I THINK THIS ONE OVER HERE IS WHERE THERE -- I'M GONNA REALLY FINDING THE GOLD. OKAY, IDLE UP. ALL RIGHT. [ STARTS ENGINE ] PUT AS MUCH GOLD IN THE BOX AS POSSIBLE. ♪ GOLD GOLD! COULD BE DANGEROUS. 'CAUSE THEN IT'LL -- THEY START LIKE THAT, AND THEN IT ENDS UP A [BLEEP] FIGHTING, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I'D BE CAREFUL 'CAUSE SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT OVER THIS WHOLE [BLEEP] STUPID THING. Narrator: IF BRAD KELLY CONDEMNS YOUR ACTIONS, YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. HERE'S THE THING, KRIS -- HE CAN'T HEAR YOU. WHAT'S GOIN' ON, EH? Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ON THE PADDY WAGON... ...IT'S KELLY VERSUS KELLY FOR THE GOLD. WHAT'S GOIN' ON, EH? ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WELL, ANDY IS NOT HAPPY. I REPEAT, ANDY IS NOT HAPPY. HE COULDN'T TAKE ME. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT HAPPENED? KRIS IS GONNA GET A PUNCH IN THE [BLEEP] FACE. [BLEEP] CRAZY. SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT. MAN, ANDY'S GONNA BE PISSED. Narrator: WHILE KRIS IS CASHING IN... OVER AT THE CLARK, WITH JUST 11 DAYS LEFT IN THE SEASON... GET A LITTLE PICKER OVER THERE. ...LOVERS TURNED RIVALS TURNED PARTNERS ZEKE TENHOFF AND EMILY RIEDEL ARE LOOKING TO GET PAID. YEAH, NO, THERE'S SOME GOOD LITTLE STREAKS OF GOLD IN HERE. I MEAN, I THINK IT'S ABOUT READY TO BE CLEANED UP AGAIN, YOU KNOW? -YEAH. THERE'S DEFINITELY MORE GOLD IN IT THAN IT WAS LAST TIME. CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF HOURS OF PRODUCTION IT'S DOWN THERE, THIS IS NOT LOOKING TOO SHABBY. I MEAN, I'M NOT -- I'M NOT UNHAPPY WITH IT. NO, WE'RE ON SOME GOOD GOLD IN THIS SPOT, MAN. I WOULD -- I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SUCK IT UP BEFORE THE ICE GOES AWAY. Narrator: THIS WINTER, THE TWO STRUCK A DEAL. ZEKE'S MINING PERMIT AND EQUIPMENT... [BLEEP] SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] ...IN EXCHANGE FOR EMILY'S HOT SPOTS AND DIVE TEAM. -ALL RIGHT. -WEIGH IT. Narrator: BUT DESPITE THE GOOD GROUNDS... 2.8 OUNCES. ...THEY'VE HAD JUST ONE $3,300 PAYDAY. NOW... -IT'S GOOD TO GO. ALL RIGHT, 10-4. LET'S PULL THE MATS AND, UH, DO ANOTHER CLEAN UP, SEE WHERE WE'RE AT. AND LET'S GO. ...WITH THE CLOCK TICKING ON THE SEASON, IT'S TIME FOR A REALITY CHECK. HONESTLY, I HAVE A LOT ON MY SHOULDERS. I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF A ONE-MAN SHOW. AND I'M TRYING TO TEACH THESE GIRLS TO DREDGE AT THE SAME TIME. AND I'M A LITTLE DUBIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE GIRLS ARE ACTUALLY PUTTING IN THE BOX. I GOT ABOUT 20 HOURS ON THIS CLEAN UP AND, UH, HOPE FOR 10 OUNCES OF GOLD. BUT I'M NOT SEEING MUCH GOLD... -HOW'S IT LOOKIN'? -WELL, IT'S GETTIN' THERE. A GOLD OMELET. ...AND MOST OF THE SEASON HAS TURNED INTO ZEKE'S DREDGING SCHOOL. BUT ZEKE'S DREDGING SCHOOL HAS TO GO ON SPRING BREAK. IF YOU CAN'T CUT IT, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADMIT IT. AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. I'M DONE TRYING TO TEACH PEOPLE TO DREDGE. I GOTTA MAKE SOME MONEY. -UH, GOOD TO GO. Narrator: THE TOTAL? ANOTHER 3,400 BUCKS, WELL BELOW ZEKE'S 10-OUNCE MARK. AH, IT'S NOT THAT BAD. WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE ON -- WE'RE ON GOOD GRABS. WE NEED MORE GOLD THAN THIS. YEAH. THIS IS ALL REALLY [BLEEP]. I THINK THAT AGREEING TO WORK WITH EMILY WAS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST DECISION. LIKE, THIS IS, AT THIS POINT NOT REALLY VERY MUCH OF A SUCCESS FOR ANYONE. THIS IS GONNA BE A HUGE FAILURE. Narrator: 100 MILES TO THE EAST... AT THE BLUFF... HOW'S IT LOOKIN' DOWN THERE? ...UNDER HIS OLD MAN'S WATCHFUL EYE, SHAWN POMRENKE HAS YET TO FIND A PAY STREAK. YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO SHAWN TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS. BUT THE NEXT PHASE OF THE CHRISTINE ROSE, I BELIEVE, IS STILL RIGHT IN FRONT OF TOWN. ALLS I CAN SAY IS, LET'S GO FOLLOW SOME DOWSING ROD BULL [BLEEP], SEE IF THAT DOES ANY GOOD. VOODOO WITCHCRAFT. -IT AIN'T VOODOO. -VOODOO WITCHCRAFT. IT IS NOT VOODOO. Narrator: AFTER 3 HOURS OF SITTING IDLE, STEVE IS READY TO FIRE UP HIS MAGIC WANDS. I GOTTA FOR A LITTLE WALK, SEE IF THERE'S A HOT VEIN AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. MY DOWSING WORKS PRETTY DAMN GOOD. YOU TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. BUT I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, IT KEPT ME FROM MOVING THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF WORTHLESS DIRT. Narrator: USING THE ANCIENT ART OF DOWSING, STEVE IS RELYING ON HIS COPPER RODS TO CROSS AT A SPOT WHERE THE GOLD IS RICH. THESE HERE THINGS TELL ME THAT THIS IS A PRETTY WEAK SPOT. Narrator: TOP SIDE, GRANDPA GOLD AND THE DOWSING RODS ARE HEADED DUE SOUTH OF THE DIVE HOLE. DOWN BELOW... I'M GONNA HEAD OVER THIS WAY. ...JUNIOR IS WALKING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. SO, UH, STARTING TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE COLOR? OH, THAT'S BETTER, GETTIN' BETTER. A PIECE THERE, A PIECE HERE. COME ON, BABY. WHERE'S THE GOLD AT? OH, YEAH, THERE WE GO, BOYS. I GOT HER NOW. IT LOOKS PROMISING. MY DOWSING RODS ARE TELLING ME THAT THERE AIN'T MUCH BETWEEN HERE AND THE BEACH. BUT, ALL OF THE SUDDEN, RIGHT THROUGH HERE, THERE'S A STREAK ABOUT 100 FEET WIDE. I'M COMIN' ON UP. ROGER THAT. THAT WAS A GOOD DIVE. WHOO. JUST KEEP SEEING ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED, YOU KNOW? THERE'S, LIKE, A STREAK THAT GOES PARALLEL WITH THIS BEACH RUNNIN' THAT WAY. WAY I WAS SEEIN', IT WAS PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT SOUTH. AND THAT'S WHERE -- THAT'S WHERE FIGURED THERE'D BE JUST A SHORTENED LOOP, YOU KNOW? THE SHORTER THE MOVE, THE EASIER. Narrator: AFTER A FAMILY POWWOW, FATHER AND SON REACH THE SAME CONCLUSION... I HOPE THERE'S GOLD THERE. YOU NEVER KNOW. ...MOVE SOUTH 100 FEET. WELL, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO GET SOME GOLD. Narrator: WHILE THE POMRENKES ARE ON THE MOVE, 100 MILES WEST... AT THE WILD RANGER... MOVE AWAY FROM THAT [BLEEP] FOR A SECOND 'CAUSE I CAN'T KEEP STRETCHING THE HOSE. ...PROSPECTING FOR THE SUB-DREDGE, SPENSER McCLESKEY IS SEARCHING AS FAR AS HIS TETHER CAN REACH. JUST WANNA WORK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO THIS COBBLE. HEY, VERN? YEAH, GO AHEAD, SPENSER. HEY, UH, I KNOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN THIS HOLE VERY LONG, BUT I'M THINKIN' IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR US TO MOVE. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN'. NO, I'M DEAD SERIOUS. WE ALL NEED TO MAKE SOME MONEY, AND THIS HOLE AIN'T GONNA PAY THE BILLS, THAT'S FOR SURE. BUT, SPENSER, WE JUST GOT HERE. IT TAKES 2 DAYS TO MOVE. IT TAKES MORE THAN 2 HOURS TO CHECK OUT A DAMN HOLE. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, GIVE ME A BREAK HERE. I KNOW IT'S PRETTY IMPLAUSIBLE IF WE DON'T CHECK THAT -- THAT ENTIRE AREA JUST FOR THE FEW HOURS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOWN THERE. YOU'RE KILLING ME. YOU'RE EITHER SEEING IT OR YOU'RE NOT. SPENSER, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD, MAN, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANOTHER MOVE LEFT IN US BEFORE THE SEASON IS OVER. HANG ON ONE SECOND, VERNON. THIS AIR IS ACTING UP LIKE CRAZY. UH... HAVING, UH, HAVING TO REALLY LABOR FOR BREATHS. I'M FROZEN UP! COME UP. ♪ Narrator: JUST WEST OF NOME HARBOR, AT THE WILD RANGER... HANG ON ONE SECOND, VERNON. THIS AIR IS ACTING UP LIKE CRAZY. UH... HAVING, UH, HAVING TO REALLY LABOR FOR BREATHS. I'M FROZEN UP. COME UP. LET'S GET YOU OUT OF THE WATER. COME ON. SON OF A BITCH. WHOO! DAMN IT. Narrator: WHILE DIVING IN SUBFREEZING TEMPERATURES, LINES HAVE TO BE CLEARED OF WATER TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF DEADLY FREEZE UPS. JOEY, DID YOU BLOW THAT LINE? I MEAN -- NO, I MEAN I'M TALKIN' ABOUT RIGHT NOW, DUDE. A LOT OF ICE. IDIOTIC...LIKE THIS, IT JUST CONTINUES YEAR AFTER YEAR. I'M [BLEEP] SICK OF IT. THIS IS PART OF WHAT WE DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS. IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING, AIR LINES FREEZING UP, HOT WATER LINES FREEZING UP. YOU JUST GOTTA BE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT'S GOING ON, STAYIN' CALM WHEN SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN. AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HOLD YOUR BREATH FOR A WHILE. Narrator: THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN AN EMERGENCY ASCENT? THE -- THIS HOLE'S NOT WORTH WORKING ANYMORE. WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN THE CHEESE OUT OF IT. WE NEED TO MOVE. Narrator: RISKING YOUR LIFE FOR NO GOLD. I THINK IT'S WORTH STAYING HERE AND PUTTING ANOTHER 50 FEET ON THE UMBILICAL. WE CAN ADD ANOTHER LENGTH OF HOSE TO THE ROBOT. AND WE COULD GET THAT SUCKER OUT THERE 100 FEET FROM THE HOLE. Narrator: FOR THE CASH-STRAPPED SKIPPER, 2 DAYS MOVING HIS ENTIRE RIG IS TIME HE JUST CAN'T AFFORD. YOU KNOW, DREDGE GIVES US A HELL OF A LOT OF AREA TO SEARCH AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY GOLD DOWN THERE. I DON'T REALLY FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE GETTING THAT FAR FROM THE HOLE. IF I WERE 50 FEET AWAY FROM THE HOLE ON THAT LAST DIVE, I WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE MOVING. SO I GUESS WE GOTTA... YOU KNOW, SOMETHING GOING ON HERE. Narrator: WITH VERNON AND HIS CREW AT AN IMPASSE... 100 MILES TO THE EAST... AT THE BLUFF... ...SHAWN'S QUEST TO WOW HIS DAD IS COMING UP LIGHT ON GOLD. YOU'LL SEE IF THE DOWSING RODS REALLY DO WORK OR NOT. [BLEEP] VOODOO WITCHCRAFT, MAN. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Narrator: NOW, DIVER JACOB MUSICH IS CHECKING TO SEE IF STEVE'S VOODOO STICKS DID THE TRICK. YEAH, I JUST ROLLED OVER A NICE, BIG ROCK HERE. NICE, LOOSE GRAVEL AND CLAY UNDERNEATH. WELL, I KINDA KNOW WHAT SHAWN'S THINKIN' 'BOUT GOING TO THE BLUFF. PRETTY, UH, FAR-FETCHED IDEA. I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT SCARED ABOUT THIS GROUND. YOU KNOW, 30 YEARS I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO HAVE ALL THE BILLS PAID AT THE END OF THE YEAR. BUT WE'RE BEYOND THAT NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE. I WANNA KEEP IT THAT WAY. I WANNA STAY IN THE RED -- UH, IN THE BLACK. I DON'T WANNA BE IN THE RED ANYMORE. Narrator: IF THE GOLD'S NOT WORKING... YOU WAS TRYING TO GET ME TO COME DOWN HERE FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. I'VE NEVER BEEN DOWN HERE. BACK IN THE DAY, YOU'D SEE A CABIN THERE BY OUR -- THE CAMP. AND THEN THERE'S A CABIN THERE. THERE'S CABINS ALL ALONG HERE. ...SHAWN STILL HAS A BACKUP PLAN. BEHIND THE CAMP TO THE WHITE MOUNTAIN AND COME ACROSS OLD BUCKET LINE DREDGE. -YEAH. -AND A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF. IS THERE A BUCKET LINE CLOSE BY? I'D LIKE TO GO SEE ONE OF THOSE. YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE, TINY GUY. WOULD BE INTERESTING TO TAKE A LITTLE CRUISE ALL THE WAY UP IN THERE AND CHECK THIS GROUND OUT. 'CAUSE I GOTTA CONVINCE DAD THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS. AS SOON AS HE SEES THAT OLD MINING EQUIPMENT, SEES SOME OLD ENGINES AND THIS AND THAT, YOU CAN SEE THAT SPARKLE IN HIS EYE. LET'S GO FOR A LITTLE CRUISE HERE. Narrator: LEAVING THE CREW TO PROSPECT THE NEW AREA, SHAWN AND STEVE HEAD OFF TO TAKE THE GRAND TOUR. 100 MILES WEST... AT THE CLARK... I'M LOSING A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE. [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW, I GUESS I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO EXACTLY. Narrator: AFTER THEIR SECOND CLEANUP OF THE SEASON WAS A BUST, ZEKE IS THINKING ABOUT CALLING OFF THE PARTNERSHIP. AT THIS POINT, I'M -- I'M STARTING TO HAVE TO KINDA REFRAME WHAT SUCCESS IS GONNA BE IN THIS -- IN THIS MINING OPERATION. I'M -- I'M -- TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, I NEED TO DO DAMAGE CONTROL SO I DON'T LOSE TOO MUCH MONEY. I AM GETTING CONTINUALLY MORE FRUSTRATED WITH EMILY'S LACK OF CONTRIBUTION TO A MINING ENTERPRISE. I AM NOT OKAY WITH THE IDEA OF MAKING MONEY FOR AN ENTITY IN A MINING OPERATION WHO DOES NOT REALLY SERVE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IF WE DON'T ALL [BLEEP] COMMUNICATE AND WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. Narrator: BLAMING THEIR LACK OF GOLD ON THE SLUICE BOX, EMILY IS ON THE WRONG END OF THE SILENT TREATMENT. IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY. IT'S ASININE. IT'S STUPID. I ALSO HAVE TO, LIKE, TREAD VERY LIGHTLY ON EVERYBODY'S FEELINGS. I JUST WISH HE WOULD COMMUNICATE WITH ME LIKE WE WERE DOING THIS TOGETHER, THAT'S ALL. LIKE, YOU KNOW, JUST [BLEEP] ORDER ME AROUND, DUDE. LIKE, AT LEAST, LIKE, TALK AND COMMUNICATE AND STRATEGIZE. YOU KNOW, ZEKE IS ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL MEN... OR WOMEN, REALLY, I'VE EVER MET. IT'S VERY HARD FOR ZEKE TO WORK WITH ME BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS ARE BEING LEFT UNSAID. Narrator: FOR THE ONE-TIME CLOSE FRIENDS... NOT EVEN GOD COULD SINK THIS SHIP. ...THEIR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP HAS ITS CHALLENGES. Narrator: FROM A FAILED ROMANCE... YOU'VE THREATENED TO BURN MY HOUSE DOWN WITH ME IN IT. I DIDN'T. THAT -- YOU'RE LYING. ...TO THE BUNGLED SALE OF A DREDGE... YOU CAN'T OWN PROPERTY FOR FREE. ...TO THE TRAGIC DEATH OF THEIR FRIEND AND CREWMATE... AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS IS [BLEEP]. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST [BLEEP]. THIS BOX JUST GOT... Narrator: WITHOUT GOLD IN THE BOX, THE WEIGHT OF THE PAST IS STARTING TO TAKE A TOLL ON THE PRESENT. I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO TOTALLY BURY THE HATCHET WITH EMILY. I DON'T TRUST HER AT ALL, NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK EMILY'S GONNA STEAL GOLD OUT OF MY SLUICE BOX. IT'S NOT THAT KINDA TRUST. IT'S LIKE, "DO YOU HAVE LOYALTY, REALLY?" YOU KNOW, NOT -- REAL COMMUNICATION ISN'T HAPPENING IS BECAUSE NEITHER OF US CAN REALLY FAKE IT. AND SO HE JUST, YOU KNOW, PUTS ON A MASK AND, LIKE, DOESN'T REALLY TALK TO ANYBODY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. IT JUST GOTTA GRAB SOMETHING OUT OF THE TRUCK. -GOOD. WHAT'S THE POINT OF TRYING TO, LIKE, HAVE SOME KIND OF PARTNERSHIP IF NOBODY'S REALLY BEING REAL? HE'S GONNA SNAP. I MEAN, I'M GONNA SEE HOW ANGRY HE IS AT ME. IT'S GONNA COME OUT. ♪ Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ON THE PADDY WAGON... ALL RIGHT, FIRST CARPET. IS THIS THE HEADER CARPET? -YEP. THAT'S A BIG MONEY CARPET, THEN. ...AFTER BEATING BACK HIS LITTLE BROTHER, KRIS KELLY IS LOOKIN' FOR A PAYDAY. ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS GET MY MONEY BACK AT THIS POINT AND PROVE THAT I DON'T NEED MY DAD ANYMORE. I CAN DO THIS [BLEEP] BY MYSELF WITH MY OWN CREW. AND, REALLY, ANDY JUST NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT I'M A BETTER DREDGER. I'M THE BETTER DREDGER BETWEEN US. THINKING HE'S BETTER THAN I AM. IN HIS [BLEEP] DREAMS. Narrator: BACK IN TOWN... SEE HOW MUCH GOLD WE GOT IN THE LAST 8 HOURS. ...THE REST OF THE KELLY CLAN ARE ALSO CLEANING UP. TIME TO SEE I KICKED MY BROTHER'S ASS IN THE GOLD. YOU DIVING OVER KRIS, LIKE THE SAME GROUNDS, THE SAME TIME AT THE SAME SPOT, I'D PUT MY MONEY OVER YOU. ANDY IS A BETTER DIVER. HE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE GOLD AND LOCATE IT UNDER THE WATER. KRIS IS A [BLEEP] IDIOT. SAYS HE WENT ON OUNCIN' OUR GROUND. I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT OUNCING OUR GROUND LOOKS LIKE. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA WEIGH IT UP, UH, SEE WHAT ANDY GOT. OKAY, WHERE WE AT? THERE'S 21... 27 GRAMS... 29. WE GOT 31 GRAMS. Narrator: 31 GRAMS IS WORTH JUST $1,200. SO, AN OUNCE OF GOLD. OH, I'M FEELING HEARTBROKEN, DUDE. LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S THE WAY IT GOES, YOU KNOW? Narrator: AS FOR KRIS... I GOT 2.1 OUNCES. HIS SCORE -- $2,500. AND OF COURSE... LET'S GO SEE WHAT ANDY GOT 'CAUSE I KNOW I BEAT HIM. HE'S GONNA BE PISSED OFF. LET'S GO. ...BRAGGING RIGHTS. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? HUH? WHERE'S YOUR GOLD? I GOT 4 OUNCES, BUDDY BOY. EVERYONE'S A SORE LOSER IN THIS FAMILY. NOBODY WANTS TO ADMIT IT. I'M THE BETTER DREDGER. -OKAY, KRIS. YOU OUTDREDGED ME. YOU HAPPY NOW? WHO GIVES A [BLEEP]? Narrator: WHILE KRIS BASKS IN HIS GLORY, N THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOME, AT ZEKE TENHOFF'S COMPOUND... IT'S A PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN [BLEEP] ICE MINING, IS THAT YOU ARE PUTTING ABSOLUTELY ZERO PRACTICAL FUNCTION IN THEM. YOU'VE CALLED UP SOME WOMEN WHO WANNA GO DIVING. AND, LIKE, NOW THEY'RE HERE. AND THAT'S ABOUT IT. Narrator: ON THE VERGE OF CALLING OFF THEIR PARTNERSHIP, ZEKE HAS CALLED FOR A MEETING TO AIR THE DIRTY LAUNDRY. PROVIDING BACK UP -- EMILY'S FATHER, STEVE. I'M PROVIDING AN AIR COMPRESSOR, THE USE OF SLEDS, UM, UMBILICAL, UM, VOLUME TANK. I'M SHARING THE COST OF GAS AND LOGISTICS. YOU KNOW, I MIGHT NOT HAVE A LOT OF THE PRACTICAL SKILLS THAT YOU HAVE, BUT I TRY TO MAKE UP FOR IT BY WORKING HARD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES ARE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT. I DON'T. YOU MIGHT HAVE, LIKE, CONSTRUED THIS SCENARIO WHERE, I'M, LIKE, BEING NICE TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO USE YOU FOR YOUR EQUIPMENT. BUT YOU'RE -- YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO SCENARIO ON THE [BLEEP] EARTH THAT WOULD COMPEL ME TO WANT TO -- TO -- TO TRY TO, LIKE, BURY THE HATCHET WITH YOU, EXCEPT AN ACTUAL DESIRE TO BURY THE HATCHET WITH YOU. THAT WOULD -- THAT... WELL, WHAT DID I DO TO YOU THAT WAS BAD? YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE GONNA, LIKE, COME AND [BLEEP] ME UP, DUDE. -NO, I DIDN'T DO THAT. -YES, YOU DID! I -- NO, I DID NOT! I DID [BLEEP] NOT, YOU GUYS! -YOU HEARD HER, ZEKE! -I DID NOT. YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE GONNA CALL -- COME UP AND BURN MY [BLEEP] HOUSE DOWN WITH ME IN IT WITH MY BROTHER AND MY FATHER AS WITNESSES. -LIE. NO, THAT'S TRUE. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WORDS I SAID. I QUOTED A RAP SONG BY IMMORTAL TECHNIQUE THAT DID NOT IMPLY THAT EXACTLY. AND THAT'S THE WAY I TOOK IT. OTHERWISE, I'D HAVE BEEN ON A AIRPLANE WITH MY 9mm. I'D HAVE PUT A BULLET IN YOUR HEAD. YOU KNOW, LIKE, HONESTLY, YOU'RE GONNA COME DOWN AND PUT A 9 MILLIMETER BULLET IN MY HEAD? NO, NO, NO. NO, WE DIDN'T. -REALLY? -HE'S MY FATHER! OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO DEFEND ME! WOULD YOU WOULD'VE DONE THAT? WOULD YOU HAVE DONE THAT. WHY WOULD HE NOT DEFEND ME? HE'S MY FATHER. YOU GUYS, COME ON. YOU KNOW, COME THE [BLEEP] ON, YOU GUYS! LOOK, I'M A HUMAN BEING. UH, ONCE YOU LOVE SOMEBODY WHEN YOU'RE HUMAN, YOU ALWAYS LOVE THEM. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE ZEKE. I WILL ALWAYS REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM. HE -- IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING. I'M WILLING TO ADMIT WHERE I WENT WRONG A COUPLE YEARS AGO. UM, BUT IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY MY FAULT, AND THAT'S WHAT ZEKE WANTS IT TO BE. EMILY -- I DON'T REALLY KNOW, LIKE, SOMETIMES WHAT SHE THINKS ABOUT WHAT SHE'S DONE. I DON'T REALLY THINK SHE HAS A VERY CLEAR PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPACT OF SOME OF HER ACTIONS. I DON'T REALLY THINK SHE EVER WILL. I DON'T THINK IT'S IN HER NATURE. WITH MS. RIEDEL HERE, I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN BURY THE HATCHET. LIKE, YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOT AS MUCH ANGER AS I DO. Narrator: AT THE BLUFF... WHEREVER THERE WAS GOLD, THEY GOT 'EM THERE. ...SHAWN'S PLAN DAZZLED DAD WITH A TRIP THROUGH TIME. YEAH, ONE PIECE AT A TIME, AND THEY GOT IT OVER THAT MOUNTAIN AND INTO THE NEXT VALLEY. YOU GOTTA GIVE THEM OLD TIMERS CREDIT, MAN. THEY WORKED. THEY PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER ALL BY THEMSELVES. THEY DIDN'T HAVE CRANES, EITHER. -BACK BREAKING. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL THEY DID IT. THE REASON THEY USED THESE BUCKET LINE DREDGES IS 'CAUSE THEY WERE SO FUEL EFFICIENT. THINK ABOUT GETTIN' THIS DRUM FROM THE PORT OF NOME BACK IN 1900. DAD LOVES THE OLD TIMER MINING STUFF BECAUSE IT'S -- IT'S HISTORY. IT -- IT SHOWS THERE WASN'T NOTHIN' THAT WAS GONNA STOP THOSE OLD TIMERS FROM GETTIN' THE GOLD. IT HAD TO BE A FEAT JUST TO GET THAT HERE. BUT WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE'S A WAY WITH THE OLD TIMERS. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, AT THE WILD RANGER... I TOLD VERN YESTERDAY AFTER I CAME UP WE DEFINITELY NEED TO MOVE, THAT THIS HOLE IS NOT WORTH WORKING ANYMORE. WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN THE CHEESE OUT OF IT. Narrator: VERNON ADKISON IS DIGGING IN HIS HEELS. THERE'S THE MAN OF THE HOUR RIGHT THERE. STINKS IN THERE, VERN. I WAS JUST GETTIN' A LITTLE STIFF IN THERE. YEAH, WE...NONE OF THAT. SO WHAT'S THE GENERAL CONSENSUS AS FAR AS THIS HOLE OR ANOTHER HOLE? DAMN NEAR TAKES AN ACT OF GOD TO GET ALL THIS DAMN GEAR MOVED. Narrator: ALREADY 100 GRAND IN THE HOLE FOR THE SUB-DREDGE, VERNON IS NOT WILLING TO SPEND THE MONEY OR THE TIME TO MOVE THE ENTIRE OPERATION. THERE'S NOT GOLD HERE. IF -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME. AND IT'S DO WE STAY HERE AND DREDGE ON NOTHING OR DO WE TAKE 2 DAYS TO MOVE AND DREDGE YOU ON SOMETHING? GUARANTEE ME THERE'S SOMETHING? I MEAN, HOW DO YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING? I CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE'S GOOD GOLD OVER THERE. BUT I CAN GUARANTEE TO YOU THAT THERE'S NOT GOLD HERE. YEP, I HEAR YA. I HEAR YA. IT'S SOUNDIN' A LOT LIKE WE'RE DONE. DONE? THAT'S KINDA WHERE I'M AT WITH IT. I DON'T THINK I CAN AFFORD ANOTHER MOVE. UM... COPY THAT. OKAY. GOOD SHOW. BEST OF LUCK. SOMETIMES, VERNON NEEDS TO BE TALKED TO IN A WAY THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS MAYBE GOT THE BALLS TO TELL HIM. I MEAN, HE'S A BIG MAN. HE'S SCARY. BUT SOMETIMES, YOU GOTTA TELL HIM EXACTLY HOW IT IS. LOOK, VERNON, YOU'RE NOT MAKING MONEY THIS WAY. THIS WON'T WORK. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. AND EXPLAIN IT IN A LOGICAL WAY. HE IS A LOGICAL PERSON, AS LONG AS HE'S NOT MAD. I'M HERE FOR THE GOLD, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. BUT THE OTHER PART OF IT IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS EQUIPMENT AND FINDING OUT WHAT IT CAN DO. THAT'S THE PAYOFF FOR ME. IT'S THE ULTIMATE EXPERIMENT WITH IT RIGHT THERE. DO WE KNOW THAT THERE IS SAND THERE? IF WE CAN GET THIS ROBOT WORKING FLAWLESSLY IN PREMIUM CONDITIONS, HELL, MAYBE THAT LAST HOLE'S THE BONANZA. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. YEAH. YEAH. GO OVER THERE, DRILL A COUPLE HOLES, DO LIKE YOU SAID. LET'S START MOVIN'. IT COULD BE A BIG HONEY HOLE. BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU GET THERE. THAT'S IT. EVERYTHING'S ON THE TABLE ON THIS MOVE. Narrator: WITH JUST 10 DAYS REMAINING, VERNON IS GAMBLING ON A 2-DAY MOVE. OVER ON CLAIM 14... ZEKE AND I HAD THIS MASSIVE FIGHT, AND WHAT I REALIZED IT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF UGLY [BLEEP] THAT ZEKE AND I NEED TO WORK THROUGH IN OUR -- IF WE'RE EVER GONNA BE ABLE TO RECONCILE. IN THE END, ZEKE AND I HAVE SO MANY ISSUES TOGETHER, WE CAN BE FIGHTING ABOUT THOSE ISSUES 24/7 OR WE CAN BE [BLEEP] WORKING. BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE MONEY. HEY, ZEKE. UH, CAN YOU COME UP? [ LAUGHS ] ZEKE'S FAMILY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MY FAMILY. AND THEREFORE, THAT -- THAT BOND, THAT CONNECTION IT -- IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE. [ LAUGHING ] AAH! I THINK THAT IN FRIENDSHIPS AND ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP, IT [BLEEP] BUILDS UP. YOU HAVE TO LET IT OUT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT. AND SOMETIMES TEMPERS HAVE TO RISE FOR THE AIR TO BE CLEARED. AND THAT'S ALL IT REALLY WAS. WE NEED TO FIND SOME GOLD. Narrator: 100 MILES FROM NOME... STEVE AND SHAWN JUST SHOWED BACK UP SO LET'S HEAD ON UP, AND I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU AT THE HOLE. I'M ON MY WAY. ...AFTER GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THE HISTORY OF GOLD AT THE BLUFF... OLD MAN POMRENKE IS LOOKING TO SEE SOME PRESENT-DAY EARNINGS. HE SAID HE THOUGHT HE SAW A NUGGET. HE HEARD IT HIT THE NOZZLE. BUT WE HAVEN'T SHUT DOWN AND LOOKED YET. SOMETIMES YOU GET THOSE NUGGETS DIVING. IT'LL HIT THE NOZZLE -- PING! YOU'LL HEAR IT. SCENERY DON'T MEAN NOTHIN' MUCH TO ME. BUT IF IT'S GOT GOLD IN THE SCENERY, THEN I REALLY LOVE IT. COME LOOK AT THE BOX. HOLY [BLEEP], THAT'S A BIG SON OF A BITCH. IT'S A NUGGET, DAD. -THAT'S A NICE ONE. IT'S GOT TO BE A HALF OUNCE. WHERE'S THE REST OF 'EM? STILL DOWN THERE. THE BEST PAY STREAK THEY'D SEEN IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS. WE ARE SEEIN' GOLD. WELL, I THOUGHT THEY WERE DOWN THERE JUST A-PARTYIN'. BUT BY GOD, THEY WERE DOIN' THEIR JOB. WELL, AS IN ANY BUSINESS, YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKIN' FORWARD. AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD YEARS AHEAD OF TIME. WHAT SHAWN WAS DOIN' WAS THINKIN' ABOUT THE FUTURE, THINKIN' ABOUT WHERE THE CHRISTINE ROSE IS GONNA GET ITS PAY DIRT FROM. THAT WAS DOIN' THINGS THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE. I FOUND THE BIGGEST NUGGET I'VE EVER FOUND, SO THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. BUT I GOTTA GET DOWN THERE AND SEE WHERE THE REST OF 'EM ARE. IT'S GOT BROTHERS AND SISTERS. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE NUGGETS, 'BOUT THE NUGGETS. Narrator: WITH JUST 10 DAYS REMAINING, THE WILD RANGER IS STILL ON TOP OF THE BOARD, WHILE EVERYONE ELSE PLAYS CATCH-UP. YEAH, SO YOU WANNA BE A GOLD MINER? LOOK AT THAT! CAN'T PUT A LOT OF GOLD IN THE BOX. [BLEEP]! [BLEEP]! I WANTED TO GO TO WAR! WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE PERSONAL? EVERYTHING IS PERSONAL. I WANT EVERYBODY IN A WORKMAN'S OUTFIT NOW! I JUST SAW SOMETHING. [BLEEP] COME JOIN US.
