 THE ICE IS MELTING BEFORE OUR EYES. IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. WORST CASE SCENARIO IS SOMEBODY GETS HURT OR POSSIBLY KILLED. OH [BLEEP] THE SEASON'S ALMOST OVER. NOW IT'S JUST EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. I [BLEEP] WORKED -- [BLEEP] YOU! WE'RE NOT GONNA PULL THE PLUG UNTIL THE BITTER END. YOU DON'T GET ANY GOLD, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET PAID. NUGGETS! THAT'S THE YELLOW-BRICK ROAD RIGHT THERE.

 WATER'S GETTING DEEP. SOME PLACES, FOOT AND A HALF, MAYBE EVEN 2 FEET DEEP IN SOME HOLES. Narrator: FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE GOLD-MINING FLEET, IT'S A HIGH-STAKES GAME OF CHICKEN. WE REALLY NEED TO GET EVERYTHING WE CAN BEFORE WE CALL IT DONE. Narrator: TIME IT RIGHT AND YOU COULD BANK THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN GOLD. Man: THIS IS IT. GET MY ASS DOWN THERE AND SUCK UP SOME GOLD. Narrator: TIME IT WRONG, AND EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED FOR WILL ONCE AGAIN BELONG TO THE BERING SEA. YOUR PROFIT MARGIN GOES WAY DOWN WHEN YOU LOSE ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S WORTH RISKING EVERYTHING TO GAIN THAT EXTRA 40 OR 50 OUNCES. Narrator: JUST OFF EAST BEACH... WE NEED TO GET THE MISS NOMER AND THE DRAGON OFF THE ICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HAVE TO RAISE THE DRAGON, AND WE HAVE TO START PULLING THE MISS NOMER BACK ACROSS THIS LEAD. Narrator: AS DAY BREAKS, GLEN LeBARON AND HIS GIRLFRIEND JASMIN GEORGE ARE ON A RESCUE MISSION. LAST NIGHT... A LEAD HAS OPENED, AND THE MISS NOMER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. Narrator: ...GLEN'S OPERATION, THE MISS NOMER, ALONG WITH HIS UNDERWATER DREDGE, THE DRAGON, BROKE FREE ON AN ICE SHEET AND BEGAN DRIFTING. NOW IT'S EITHER FIND A WAY OFF THE ICE OR LOSE THE ENTIRE OPERATION AND ALL THE GOLD WAITING IN THE SLUICE BOX. Glen: LAST NIGHT, WE FLOATED THE DRAGON OFF THE BOTTOM. NOW I HAVE TO HOIST THE THING OUT, CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR STUFF, AND GET ACROSS THAT SHORT LEAD BEFORE IT GETS BIG. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL ON A PIECE, BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL. THAT LOOKS EXACTLY HOW WE LEFT IT. IT'S AS IF EVERYTHING BROKE AROUND IT, AND IT JUST STAYED RIGHT ON THAT ICE CAKE. I'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH LOSING THE DRAGON ONCE. I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE GOING THROUGH THAT AGAIN. BUT HERE IT IS. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED TIME. WE HAVE TO GET THE DRAGON UP, AND WE NEED TO START PULLING THE MISS NOMER ASHORE. Narrator: THE FIRST STEP -- RIGGING ALL THE GEAR FOR TRAVEL. WE NEED TO GET INTO SHORE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AS SOON AS I FINISH LOADING UP THESE ITEMS, WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AND LOOK FOR AN ICE BRIDGE, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HERE AND THE JETTY. WE HAVEN'T MADE IT TO SAFETY YET. WE NEED TO GET ACROSS THAT LEAD, BUT WE'LL FIND A WAY. Narrator: PACKED AND READY TO MOVE, STEP TWO IS FINDING A SPOT WHERE THE TIDE HAS FORMED AN ICE BRIDGE TO TOW IT ALL TO SHORE. LOOK, THE TWO ICE EDGES ARE TOUCHING. IF WE MOVE REAL FAST, I CAN HOP ON MY SNOW MACHINE, AND WE CAN PULL THE MISS NOMER ACROSS RIGHT THERE. WE'VE GOT TO HURRY. IF THAT STAYS ATTACHED THERE, THEN WE CAN -- WE CAN JUST SNOW-MACHINE IT ACROSS. Glen: EVERYTHING'S READY TO TOW. WE'VE GOT THE ICE LEADS TOUCHING RIGHT HERE, SO I'M GONNA RUN AND HOP ON MY SNOW MACHINE WITH JAS, AND WE'RE GONNA BLAST ACROSS AND JUST HOPE THAT THE ICE CONTINUES TO TOUCH THERE. OTHERWISE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SNOW MACHINE TO RESCUE, AS WELL. SO LET'S HURRY, JAS. Narrator: 8 MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... Vernon: WATER'S GETTING DEEP. THIS ICE IS GETTING PRETTY SKETCHY. IF THIS ICE BREAKS LOOSE, THE WIND'LL TAKE IT OUT, SO WE GOT TO WATCH IT VERY CAREFULLY. IT'S LIKE A [BLEEP] LAKE OUT HERE. Narrator: ...WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON IS MAKING HIS LAST STAND ON MELTING ICE. YOU KNOW, WE CAN PULL 30 OR 40 OUNCES OUT OF THIS HOLE. WE JUST GOT TO GET ANOTHER 30 OR 40. Narrator: AFTER THREE YEARS OF FAILURE AND A MILLION DOLLARS BURNED, THIS WINTER... Man: GRAND TOTAL IS 38.77 OUNCES. Narrator: ...VERNON HAS HURDLED TO THE TOP OF THE GOLD COUNT WITH 116 OUNCES, WORTH OVER 150 GRAND. Vernon: THIS IS THE BEST TEAM I'VE BEEN WITH. BRING IT IN HERE! COME ON! COME ON! Narrator: NOW HE'S GUNNING FOR THE FLEET'S FIRST-EVER 200-OUNCE SEASON. Juston: TEMPERATURE'S COMING UP. THIS'LL POSSIBLY BE ONE OF MY LAST DIVES, SO DEFINITELY GOT TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT. Narrator: LEADING THE CHARGE, VERNON'S ACE IN THE HOLE, JUSTON COOK. WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT -- I GOT A TEAM OF SHARKS. WE JUST GOT TO TRY TO GET IT WHILE THE GETTING'S GOOD. THIS HOLE WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT MIGHT BE THE LAST ONE. MY STATED GOAL WAS 200 OUNCES. THAT ONLY LEAVES 84 TO GO. YOU OUGHT TO BE GOOD TO GO. Juston: I'M GONNA GO HIT IT UP. I WILL GET THE GOLD, COME HELL OR HIGH WATER. TILL THE LAST DEAD NUT PIECE OF ICE DRIFTS OUT TO SEA. Juston: GETTING 'ER DONE! Vernon: GET AFTER THAT GOLD, BUDDY. JUSTON: Yeah, Roger that. Oh, yeah. That's some good color right there. [ LAUGHING ] ALL RIGHT. We stay on gold like this, think this is gonna be the best haul all season. All right, buddy. IT'S GONNA BE A BIG PAYDAY -- A HUMONGOUS PAYDAY. Narrator: AS THE WILD RANGER RAKES IN MORE GOLD, JUST 200 YARDS AWAY... TRY THAT PLACE BEHIND THE LADDER. I am behind the ladder. Narrator: ...THE KELLY FAMILY HAS COLLECTED 13 OUNCES THIS WINTER, WITH MORE WAITING IN THE SLUICE BOX. WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM FINDING WORKABLE GROUND. I MEAN, HE SEES GOLD, BUT HE JUST DOESN'T SEE ENOUGH OF IT. WE NEED AT LEAST 1/4 OUNCE AN HOUR TO KEEP RUNNING. Narrator: BUT THEIR HONEY HOLE... ...IS RUNNING OUT OF HONEY. Hey, I know where I want to move, though. YEAH? WHERE'S THAT? Right next to Pomrenke. YEAH, I KNOW. HE DID IT TO US FIRST. Narrator: YESTERDAY... POMRENKES ARE OVER ON OUR SPOT? THIS IS [BLEEP] Narrator: ...SHAWN POMRENKE AND THE BIGGER, MORE POWERFUL SHAMROCK MOVED TO WITHIN 90 FEET OF THE REAPER. HE'S GOT TO MOVE IN ON THE LITTLE GO-GETTER? NOW THE HOLE THAT WAS ONCE THEIR MEAL TICKET... THIS WHOLE [BLEEP] AREA? GONE. ...HAS BECOME MERELY LEFTOVERS. THEIR TAILING PILE IS NOT ACTUALLY TOO FAR AWAY FROM US. I ACTUALLY WALKED UP IT. IT'S ALMOST TO THE ICE. Kris: SHAWN SUCKS, AND THAT HOT SPOT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE 60 OUNCES. WE ONLY HIT HALF THE GROUND. HEY, YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD IN HERE. Narrator: FOR THE FIGHTING IRISH, THERE'S NO TIME TO CRY OVER SPILLED GOLD. I GOT TO GET DOWN THERE AND PUT MY TIME IN. THE HOURS ARE SLIM. WHAT HAVE I LEARNED WHAT IT TAKES TO DREDGE GOLD IN NOME? JUST KEEP WORKING. JUST WORK HARD, DON'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH, AND JUST ALWAYS MOVE FORWARD. Narrator: RATHER THAN MOVE THE DREDGE OR CALL THE SEASON QUITS, KRIS KELLY IS HEADED BACK DOWN TO MOP UP THE SCRAPS. I'M GONNA TRY TO GET AS MUCH AS I CAN. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GOLD DOWN THERE, BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TRY TO TAKE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WITH YOU, BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOURS UNTIL YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND. Man: LAST DIVE OF THE SEASON, MAN. SUCK UP AS MUCH GOLD AS YOU CAN. Narrator: WHILE KRIS WORKS TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE GROUNDS... 30 YARDS AWAY, ON THE SHAMROCK... NOTHING THAT'S WORTH SITTING DOWN THERE AND... WASTING ALL MY ENERGY ON. Narrator: WITH ONLY 30 OUNCES, WORTH $39,000, COLLECTED SO FAR, AND $100,000 DREDGE TO PAY FOR, SHAWN POMRENKE IS NOT INTERESTED IN SETTLING FOR SCRAPS. Shawn: WE AIN'T ON AS MUCH GOLD AS I'D LIKE TO BE. EVERY YEAR, IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER TO STAY ON THE GOLD AND STAY IN THESE AREAS THAT CAN MAKE FOR THESE GOOD SEASONS. Narrator: FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS... HEE HEE HEE! FIRST ONE HERE WINS. Vernon: THAT'S THE FRIGGIN' SHAMROCK. THEY'RE SPITTING DISTANCE FROM US. Narrator: ...SHAWN HAS BEEN CUTTING A SWATH THROUGH THE TOMCOD CLAIM, SEARCHING FOR BIG GOLD... OH, HERE COME THE KELLY BOYS. Narrator: ...NO MATTER WHOSE FEATHERS GET RUFFLED WHILE HE DOES IT. ANOTHER DEAD HOLE. Narrator: NOW MR. GOLD MAY HAVE REACHED THE END OF THE ROAD. THERE WAS THAT HOLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHERE WE STARTED OUT HERE. BUT SHAWN'S NEWEST HIRE, DECKHAND JACOB MUSICH, HAS ONE LAST SPOT IN MIND. IT WAS FURTHER EAST FROM WHERE WE STARTED. THE PITCH -- AN AREA JACOB PROSPECTED WITH ANOTHER CREW BEFORE HE WAS HIRED ONTO THE SHAMROCK. YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE WORTH GOING BACK OVER THERE. JACOB JUMPED FROM THE LAZY GATOR CREW AND COME OVER TO THE SHAMROCK. GOT A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM, BUT THE ICE IS THIN, IT'S BEEN MOVING AROUND A LOT. [BLEEP] IT. Narrator: WITH TIME RUNNING OUT, SHAWN IS THROWING A HAIL MARY... YEAH, WE GOT TO MOVE. THIS SPOT AIN'T PAYING OUT. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, LET'S GET THIS THING MOVED! Narrator: ...MOVING THE 9-TON SHAMROCK ACROSS THINNING ICE. Shawn: IN ONE DAY, YOU CAN MAKE UP FOR A MONTH AND A HALF OF WORKING YOUR ASS OFF AND NOT GETTING [BLEEP] THIS IS IT. WE MADE IT. GETTING THE HOT-WATER HEATER HOOKED UP, START CUTTING OUR HOLES. UH-OH. HOLY [BLEEP] Narrator: THE SHAMROCK BOYS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES LOOKING TO MAKE THIS GROUND THEIR FINAL SCORE. JACOB'S FORMER EMPLOYER HAS THE SAME IDEA. [ CHUCKLES ] HERE'S JOE. WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING COOL. Narrator: ON THE MELTING BERING SEA... HERE'S JOE. TRYING TO KEEP EVERYTHING COOL. Narrator: FOR THE THIRD SPOT IN A ROW, SHAWN POMRENKE IS IN A BATTLE OVER MINING GROUNDS. RELAX, BUDDY. RELAX. WHY ARE YOU GUYS ALL [BLEEP] BENT OUT OF SHAPE? I MEAN [BLEEP] WHEN DID YOU TALK ABOUT COMING BACK? WHY IN THE [BLEEP] [BLEEP] WORK OVER THERE! [BLEEP] DAMN IT! YOU GUYS ALL [BLEEP] COME BACK ALL [BLEEP] HUFFY AND PUFFY, THEN GO [BLEEP] SOMEWHERE ELSE! [BLEEP] MOTHER [BLEEP] I [BLEEP] WORKED -- [BLEEP] YOU! OKAY. [BLEEP] ME, THEN. [BLEEP] YOU. [BLEEP] ME, THEN. Narrator: BUT OUT HERE, IT'S FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED. Shawn: IT'S A MINING CLAIM, AND I HAVE PERMISSION TO BE OUT HERE. BOB'S LYING. I'VE PAID A LOT OF MONEY IN ROYALTIES TO WORK THAT GROUND, AND I JUST FOLLOW THE GOLD. HE WAS ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE, BUT IT WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? YOU WANT ME TO QUIT?" SHOULD WE JUST STOP MINING? HELL NO. FIND SOME GOLD. COLD GOLD. I MEAN, TO MAKE THIS WHOLE OPERATION PAY FOR ITSELF, I NEED TO GET 150 OUNCES. OTHERWISE, I JUST BLEW ANOTHER $100,000. AND I HAD TWO YEARS OF BEING CLOSE TO $250,000 -- QUARTER-MILLION DOLLARS. FWT! Narrator: AFTER FIGHTING ANOTHER TURF WAR, THE ONLY QUESTION REMAINING -- IS THE DIRT WORTH THE HURT? See what's at the end of this hose. HOW'S IT LOOKING? Working down through some cobble. Down to... looks like sand. No, I'm gonna keep punching holes here and see what I can find. WE WORKED THIS AREA EARLIER THIS YEAR, AND THIS IS WHERE I FOUND THESE. YOU KNOW? SO THAT'S WHY WE CAME BACK. Let's see what's at the bottom of this little hole here. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Here we go. Oh-ho. Whoa-ho. Oh, there's some easy picking material right here. That looks beautiful. This bottom's loaded. We're in the gold now, boys. It looks like 2 ounce an hour, if not better. Hell yeah. [ LAUGHING ] The gold is flowing like a fine wine. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN IS LOOKING TO FINISH STRONG... 8 MILES TO THE EAST, EMILY RIEDEL AND THE EROICA... EASY! GO SLOW! ...ARE JUST PLAIN FINISHED. WATCH OUT. DON'T GO IN THE HOLE. THE LAST DREDGE ON THE ICE THIS WINTER IS NOW AIMING TO BE THE FIRST ONE OFF. WE'RE OUT. AND THE DRAIN CLEARS UP. AFTER ESCAPING THE BREAKING ICE JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME, EMILY IS NOW SCRAMBLING TO GET HER RIG ALL THE WAY BACK TO SHORE. WE HAVE TO MOVE. THIS IS -- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR US TO BE HERE. IT'S KIND OF THE ESSENCE OF OUR ICE-MINING SEASON. WE'VE BEEN ON GREAT GOLD THE ENTIRE TIME, BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO MINE IT. Narrator: FOR EMILY... WE'RE CALLING IT THE DRAGON SLAYER. ...A $50,000 GAMBLE ON NEW EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN A BUST. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUCTION. Narrator: SHE'S PRODUCED JUST ONE OUNCE OF GOLD, WORTH 1,300 BUCKS, FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON. Emily: WORST CLAIM THAT I'VE EVER SEEN. I'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT ON THE ICE, AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE IT. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE CREW OF THE EROICA SIGNING OFF FOR ICE SEASON. Emily: IT WAS MY FIRST SEASON AS AN ICE CAPTAIN. THERE'S A LOT OF DECISIONS I COULD'VE MADE THAT WOULD'VE MADE ICE BETTER. I BELIEVE IN REINVENTING WHAT WE DO UP HERE, BUT I CHOSE THE WRONG TIME TO EXPERIMENT. THERE YOU GO. AH, HEY! THE SEASON PRETTY MUCH ENDED THE WAY IT STARTED. BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND END, IT'S ALL THE SAME -- BROKEN AND DYSFUNCTIONAL. Narrator: WHILE THE EROICA IS SECURELY ON THE BEACH... JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT TO SEA... OKAY, UH... THINK WE CAN MAKE IT? YOU WORRIED? YOU WANT TO GET OFF? WE SHOULD LOOK ON THE OTHER SIDE, TOO. MAYBE IT'S CONNECTED. I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT RIGHT ACROSS HERE. ALL RIGHT, JAS, I'M GOING. Narrator: WITH A NARROW ICE BRIDGE HOLDING IN PLACE FOR NOW, GLEN AND JASMINE MUST ACT FAST TO TOW THE MISS NOMER AND ALL THEIR GOLD ONTO DRY LAND. Glen: YEAH, WE JUST PULLED OUT WITH A SNOW MACHINE, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO SHORE, HOPEFULLY. HOPEFULLY OUR BRIDGE IS STILL THERE. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: APPROACHING THE CROSSING, THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION -- FLOOR IT AND HANG ON FOR DEAR LIFE. Glen: WHOO! Narrator: THE MISS NOMER IS FINALLY SAFELY ACROSS THE LEAD. FOR GLEN AND JASMINE, WINTER DREDGING IS OFFICIALLY OVER. I CONSIDER THIS MINING SEASON A SUCCESS. I DIDN'T GET AS MUCH GOLD AS I EXPECTED, BUT I REKINDLED MY PASSION FOR MINING. AND JAS AND I, BY SOME MIRACLE, ARE STILL TOGETHER. Narrator: OFF THE COAST OF NOME, ALASKA... Woman: HOW'S IT LOOKING DOWN THERE? WHAT? [ LAUGHING ] ZEKE: I know. It's pretty nuts. Narrator: AFTER A ROCKY WINTER SEASON, DIVER ZEKE TENHOFF HAS FINALLY HIT PAY DIRT. Let's see if I can count the pieces in just this little Dinner-plate-sized area. ARE YOU SERIOUS? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -- Can't even count them. You know, it's pretty insane that, like, yes, at the 11th hour, I'm on it. Yeah, this is good. What I'm looking at is good. I want to beat Glen. [ Laughing ] Narrator: THIS WINTER... I DON'T REALLY EVEN -- I DON'T EVEN REALLY CARE IF WE'RE DOING THAT. ...AFTER HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH GLEN LeBARON BLEW UP... YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO [BLEEP] TALKING TO YOU. [BLEEP] OFF. HAVING "THE CLARK" PAINTED ON SOMETHING, IT FEELS GOOD. Narrator: ...ZEKE REFUSED TO QUIT, STARTING HIS OWN OPERATION. ZEKE: All right. Narrator: NOW, DAYS OF PROSPECTING AND HARD WORK ARE FINALLY PAYING OFF. This is fantastic. I JUST HOPE WE HAVE GROUND TO STAND ON. THAT'S ALL. I'M JUST GETTING NERVOUS 'CAUSE THE ICE IS LIKE -- I STEP OUT OF THE SHACK, AND IT'S JUST SLUSH. Ice is only a foot deep. Narrator: BUT IN GOLD MINING, TIMING IS EVERYTHING. THE SHACK, IT'S JUST BORING THROUGH IT. WITH JUST 10 HOURS OF DREDGING ON HIS NEW HOT SPOT... ROGER. ...ZEKE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL THE PLUG. Zeke: WE GOT HOLES IN THE PRESSER RIDGE, PUDDLES THAT ARE FEET THICK THAT ARE MELTING THROUGH THE SURFACE OF WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS THICK ICE. AT A CERTAIN POINT, YOU JUST GOT TO, LIKE, HANG IT UP AND NOT PUT YOURSELF IN ANY FURTHER DANGER. Woman: TIME TO CALL IT QUITS. Narrator: 2 MILES TO THE WEST... [ SHAWN LAUGHING ] Whoo! Look at that chunk of gold. That's like a piggy bank there. Narrator: SO FAR, SHAWN POMRENKE'S GAMBLE TO MOVE THE SHAMROCK HAS BEEN A SUCCESS. Feels good to finally see this 2-ounce-an-hour material. There's gonna be some pickers in the box. I guarantee it. ALL RIGHT. EVER SINCE YOU'VE BEEN DOWN, THE ICE IS MELTING A LOT WORSE. THE TAILING HOLE IS GETTING HUGE. Yeah. I think it's time to pull this dredge off and get the hell out of here. ROGER THAT. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. HEY, JACOB, COME CHECK THIS OUT. NUGGETS! THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO END IT. [ LAUGHS ] HOLY [BLEEP] Narrator: AFTER FIGHTING OFF ANOTHER CREW, MR. GOLD MANAGED TO PUT ANOTHER EIGHT HOURS WORTH OF PAY DIRT THROUGH THE SLUICE BOX. YOU GOT TO GO WHERE THE GOLD'S AT. IF THERE AIN'T NO GOLD ON A CLAIM, THERE AIN'T NO REASON BEING THERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST GIVE UP. THEY QUIT. NOT MY STYLE. CHRISTINE ROSE WILL ANNIHILATE THIS. Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLAIM... WHOLE LINE OF IT, ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE WHOLE BOX. Narrator: AFTER DREDGING UP EVERY LAST FLAKE OF GOLD FROM THEIR SPOT... LOOK AT ALL THE GOLD UP IN HERE. ...THE KELLY BOYS CHECK OUT THEIR FINAL HAUL OF THE SEASON. THERE'S A NICE PIECE RIGHT THERE. Man: PEACE AND QUIET AND LOTS OF GOLD. DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, WE ALL WANT THAT. Narrator: WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WAITING IN THEIR SLUICE BOXES... AND THE ICE SPLINTERING BENEATH THEM... THIS ICE IS GETTING SCARY AS HELL. LOOK AT THESE BIG CRACKS ONSHORE. Narrator: ...IT'S AN ALL-OUT RACE BACK TO LAND. LET'S GET TO WORK, AND LET'S GET THIS [BLEEP] DONE. GOT THE...HOOKED TO THE DOZER, THE DOZER HOOKED TO THE DREDGE, AND 6 MILES OF ROTTEN ICE TO GO ACROSS. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] GETTING CLOSER TO SHORE. OFF THE ICE, ONTO DRY LAND. YEAH! Narrator: AS THE ICE BREAKS UP BY THE MINUTE, EVERY CREW IS BACK ON THE BEACH. EVERY CREW BUT ONE. JUSTON: It is raining gold down here, boys. It's ridiculous. RIDICULOUS GOLD -- THAT'S WHAT I LOVE. It's got to be close to an ounce an hour. So we're gonna suck the life out of it. Narrator: FOR WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON, THE BEST SEASON OF HIS LIFE ISN'T OVER UNTIL HE SAYS IT'S OVER. Vernon: THIS IS THE BEST HOLE YET, BY FAR AND AWAY. FOUND PROBABLY MORE GOLD THAN ANYBODY ELSE HAS EVER FOUND OUT HERE IN THE WINTER. WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT IN PULLING OUT NOW? Whoo! WE'RE GONNA STAY HERE TILL THAT SON OF A BITCH SINKS, MAN. Narrator: IN THE MELTING PORT OF NOME, ALASKA... Kris: WE GOT TO GET GOING. FINAL CLEANOUT OF THE YEAR. IT SHOULD BE PRETTY BIG. ALL RIGHT, WE GOT FIVE BUCKETS TO SCOOP LIKE THIS, ONE SCOOP AT A TIME. Narrator: AT THE END OF A GRUELING ICE-MINING SEASON, FINAL CLEANUPS ARE UNDER WAY. DO YOU SEE HOW THICK IT IS, DAD? IT'S PRETTY THICK. SWEET! WHOO! WE'VE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH GOLD IN ANY CLEANUP WE'VE EVER DONE. Narrator: ALL ACROSS TOWN... Emily: WE NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PAYOUT. 'CAUSE I SPENT WAY TOO MUCH MONEY ON THIS. Narrator: ...A BONE-TIRED FLEET LOOKS TO CASH IN FOR A JOB WELL DONE. NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE LAST PLACE. WHAT YOU GOT IS WHAT YOU GOT. WHOA. THERE'S SOME GOLD IN THERE. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF GOLD. LOOK AT THAT! HOLY [BLEEP] THAT'S THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD RIGHT THERE. WHOO! Narrator: NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHO STRUCK GOLD... Shawn: WE GOT SOME WORK TO DO NOW. Narrator: ...AND WHO STRUCK OUT. AT EMILY RIEDEL'S APARTMENT... Emily: GOLD SCRAMBLE. THE MOST EXPENSIVE OMELET IN THE WORLD, RIGHT? Narrator: ...THE ROOKIE ICE SKIPPER SET A GOAL OF 60 OUNCES. ALL RIGHT, DUDES, LET'S, UH -- LET'S GO AHEAD AND WEIGH IT. Narrator: AND THE MOMENT OF TRUTH HAS ARRIVED. 3.18 OUNCES. SO... ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT'S, UM...AWESOME. Narrator: 3.18 OUNCES IS WORTH A MEASLY 4,100 BUCKS. THIS TIME, WE USED A TOTAL EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM. AT THE END, IT AT LEAST GOT US SOME GOLD, SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT POSITIVE. OH, I'M [BLEEP] OUT I'M GONNA GO FOR A DRIVE. ALL RIGHT. [BLEEP] OUT. THIS ICE-MINING SEASON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT IT, BUT IT WAS AGAINST US. WE HAD -- WE HAD TOO MANY ODDS AGAINST US. Narrator: ACROSS TOWN... LET'S GO TO POTTER'S. YOU CAN SELL THIS GOLD AND GET THAT MONEY AND GET ANDY ON A PLANE BACK TO HAWAII. ...BRAD AND KRIS ARE HEADED TO A LOCAL GOLD BUYER TO CASH OUT. ANDY REALLY JUST NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK HERE IN NOME, YOU KNOW? NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN TAKE THIS KIND OF LIFESTYLE. NOTICEABLY ABSENT -- THE YOUNGEST KELLY, ANDY, SHUT DOWN WITH THE FLU. Brad: ANDY'S BEEN SICK, BUT HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, HE'LL GET OVER IT. HE'S A GROWN MAN. HE'S NOT 10 YEARS OLD. ONCE HE GETS PAID, ONCE WE GIVE HIM HIS LITTLE BIT OF MONEY, HE'LL BE HAPPY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU'RE GONNA WEIGH THAT ONE FIRST. Narrator: IN THEIR FIRST SEASON ON THE ICE, THE FIGHTIN' KELLYS HAVE BROUGHT IN 13 OUNCES. TO TURN A PROFIT WITH THEIR BARGAIN-BASEMENT DREDGE, THEY'LL NEED AT LEAST ANOTHER 10. SCALE THAT. YOU TALK ABOUT CLOSE TO 20. YOU GOT 20.09. HOLY [BLEEP] KIND OF BREATHTAKING. I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GONNA GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT. Narrator: 20.09 OUNCES IS WORTH OVER $26,000. AND THERE'S THE PARTS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. YEAH, THAT'S THE REAL DEAL. THAT'LL TAKE ME HOME. KRIS, THANKS FOR DIVING. [ CHUCKLES ] DON'T PLAY AROUND. Narrator: FOR THE KELLYS, IT'S THE BIGGEST SCORE THEY'VE EVER HAD. SO, UM... YOU KNOW, DIVIDED BY THREE... IS... NO, IT ISN'T 50/50. WHY NOT? UH, BECAUSE THERE'S THREE OF US. Narrator: NATURALLY, BRAD HAS A PAYMENT STRUCTURE IN MIND. ANDY'S ON THE INVESTMENT PLAN, OKAY? AS HIS FATHER, I'M TRYING TO INVEST HIS MONEY ON WHAT I THINK HE SHOULD DO. SO I'M TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF HIS MONEY AND INVESTING IT FOR HIM. THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HE'S GONNA LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT. IT'S LIKE THE ASSOCIATE PLAN. YOU PUT IN THE ASSOCIATE FEES, AND WHEN HE'S READY TO LEAVE, I'LL GIVE HIM ASSOCIATE BUYOUT. MINUS WEAR AND TEAR, OKAY? [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: OVER AT THE POMRENKE CLEANUP SHACK... Shawn: LAST CLEANUP WAS A DOOZY. SHAWN'S WINTER GOAL -- 150 OUNCES. TO GET THERE, HE'LL NEED A MASSIVE 120 MORE. Shawn: WE'RE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. 11... 16. [BLEEP] YES, THERE IS. 34. CLOSE, HUH? 37.85. HELL YEAH. NICE JOB, PHIL. Narrator: 37.85 OUNCES MEANS A $49,000 PAYDAY. THAT'S PRETTY. WISH WE WOULD'VE FILLED IT UP. AIN'T CHRISTINE ROSE JAR OF GOLD, BUT THAT'S A GOOD PAYCHECK. Narrator: MR. GOLD'S FINAL TALLY -- 67 OUNCES, WORTH $87,000 -- SHORT OF HIS GOAL AND ON THE CURRENT LEADERBOARD, ONLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR RUNNER-UP. THAT'S A JAR OF GOLD THERE. WE GOT SOME GOLD. AT LEAST IT WASN'T LIKE LAST YEAR WHERE WE COULDN'T GET ON THE GOLD AT ALL. 67 OUNCES. I'M READY TO TAKE A BREAK. IT'S BEEN A LONG MINING SEASON. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN MUST SETTLE FOR SECOND PLACE... BACK ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... THE MAN SITTING IN FIRST PLACE, WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON, CHOSE TO STAY OUT ON THE ICE... Vernon: HOLY [BLEEP] Narrator: ...A DECISION PROVING COSTLY FOR HIS LEAD DIVER. I SUNK MY TRUCK. 10 FEET FROM THE DAMN BEACH. Juston: I WAS SLOWLY CREEPING ONTO THE BEACH, AND IT JUST SUDDENLY BROKE OUT FROM UNDER ME. AND, HELL, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW FAR IT WAS GONNA KEEP GOING. Narrator: WITH THE ICE BUCKLING UNDERNEATH IT, THE CLOCK IS RUNNING OUT ON THE 2-TON TRUCK. Juston: NOW GIVE ME A GOOD JERK! YOU TRY AND JERK THE [BLEEP] OUT OF IT ONE MORE TIME. ALL RIGHT. OH [BLEEP] Shawn: HERE WE GO, BOYS. 5 1/2 OUNCES PER GUY. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. [ CHUCKLING ] THAT'S NOT TOO BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL. MM. EASY, MR. GOLD. 5 1/2. THAT'S NOT A BAD PAYCHECK. DAMN STRAIGHT. WELL, WE GOT AN EXTRA .25 HERE. I GUESS THAT'S DAD'S CUT HERE. THERE YOU GO, STEVE POMRENKE. Narrator: OUT ON THE FORMERLY FROZEN BERING SEA... YOU TRY AND JERK THE [BLEEP] OUT OF IT ONE MORE TIME. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: ...VERNON ADKISON AND HIS LEAD DIVER ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR STAYING OUT TOO LONG. OH [BLEEP] [BLEEP] DAMN IT! [BLEEP] [BLEEP] DAMN! I HOOKED ONTO HIM AND WAS TRYING TO PULL HIM OUT, AND THEN THAT PIECE OF ICE JUST BROKE OFF AND SUNK THE TRUCK UP TO THE WINDSHIELD ON BOTH ENDS. AND THAT WAS THE END OF THAT TRUCK. Juston: THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WAIT A LITTLE TOO LATE TO COME OFF THE ICE. HARD LESSON LEARNED RIGHT HERE, DAMN IT. WE'RE GONNA CALL IT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE END OF THE SEASON. Narrator: WITH ONE TRUCK ALREADY SUNK, VERNON CAN'T AFFORD TO ROLL THE DICE WITH HIS GOLD. Vernon: IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK FOR MOVING THE GEAR OFF THE ICE. WE'RE CALLING IT QUITS AND PACKING THINGS UP. SHUTTING THIS BITCH DOWN. HERE WE GO. Vernon: THE ICE WAS DETERIORATING. WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO, IT'S TIME TO GO. SO WE LEFT GOLD IN THAT HOLE. BUT I GOT THE GPS POSITION. I'LL GO BACK AND GET IT, COME SUMMERTIME. Narrator: JUST OUTSIDE THE NOME CITY LIMITS... Zeke: CHECK IT OUT. OH, NICE. IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO SHABBY. NO. THERE'S SOME GOLD IN THERE. THERE'S SOME GOLD IN THERE. I LIKE IT. ...AFTER A TURBULENT WINTER, ZEKE TENHOFF IS CLEANING UP HIS VERY OWN GOLD. Zeke: NO MINING SEASON IS A FAILURE UNLESS YOU JUST GIVE UP IN DISGUST. YOU KNOW, THE SEASON COULD'VE GONE A LOT OF WAYS, YOU KNOW? AND IT COULD'VE BEEN A HIGHLY PROFITABLE SEASON. HOWEVER, IT KIND OF WENT A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WORKING WITH GLEN DEFINITELY KIND OF DISRUPTED AND MESSED UP MY WHOLE SEASON. Narrator: WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN... Glen: THIS ACCOUNTS FOR ALL THE GOLD THAT I GOT SINCE ZEKE AND I SPLIT. Narrator: ...ZEKE'S FORMER PARTNER TURNED RIVAL, GLEN LeBARON, IS CLEANING UP, AS WELL. ZEKE'S AN IMPOSTER. LIKE, HE PORTRAYS HIMSELF AS BEING A MINER AND, LIKE -- HE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR LIKE FOUR YEARS. GLEN HAS JUST BEEN A SOUL-CRUSHING NIGHTMARE. Narrator: THE BIG QUESTION -- WHO GOT MORE? YO, LEE. HOW WE DOING? OKAY. WE'RE ZEROED OUT. Zeke: I HOPE WE HAVE WAY MORE MONEY THAN GLEN. [ PAN TAPPING ] OH, YEAH. 5.5. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ZEKE'S TAKE -- 5.5 OUNCES, WORTH OVER $7,000. OKAY. YOU GOT 7.25. OKAY. Narrator: SINCE THE BREAKUP, GLEN HAS COLLECTED 1.75 OUNCES MORE THAN ZEKE. YOU CAN FRONT ME, UH... $6,500. OKAY. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. I'LL HAVE SOME MORE GOLD SOON. I KNOW THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY OUT THERE IN THE SEA. I JUST GOT TO GET OUT THERE AND GET IT THIS SUMMER. Zeke: IT'S BITTERSWEET, BUT THAT SAID, THAT'S NOT BAD FOR 10 HOURS ON THE BOX. IF I CAN STAY IN THIS STUFF ALL SUMMER, I'M GONNA HAVE THE BEST SEASON OF MY LIFE. YEAH. [ LAUGHING ] Narrator: ACROSS TOWN, AT VERNON ADKISON'S CLEANUP SHACK. Vernon: IT'S FINAL CLEANUP.
