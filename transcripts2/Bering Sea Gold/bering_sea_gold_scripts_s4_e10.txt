 Narrator: ANOTHER GRUELING SUMMER MINING SEASON IS NEARLY IN THE BOOKS. JUST A LITTLE FROZEN. IT'LL BE OKAY. Narrator: AS DREDGERS GEAR UP FOR ONE LAST SHOT AT THE GOLD... OKAY. SO WE'RE OFF RIGHT NOW, BUDDY. Narrator: THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED. THIS ICE IS A LOT THICKER THAN I THOUGHT. Narrator: JUST 25 OUNCES STAND BETWEEN EMILY RIEDEL AND A SMALL, BUT MEANINGFUL PROFIT. 150 OUNCES WOULD BE FANTASTIC AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO PULL TOGETHER SOME MONEY BEFORE THE SEASON ENDS, AND IT'S ENDING REALLY QUICKLY. MOST EVERYBODY'S PULLING OUT, BUT WE'RE COUNTING ON GETTING OUT THERE AND GETTING SOME MORE GOLD. Narrator: SUCCESS FOR WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON WILL TAKE MORE THAN JUST GOLD. WE GOT A PERSONNEL ISSUE I GOTTA DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW. Narrator: HE'LL ALSO NEED TO REPAIR A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FIRSTBORN DAUGHTER. ELAINE IS 24 RIGHT NOW. I'VE ALREADY TOLD ELAINE AS MUCH AS I CAN TELL HER. SHE DIDN'T LEARN BY NOW, WELL, THEN, SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT ON HER OWN. ONE THING ABOUT IRISH PEOPLE, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS TO OUR STORIES. IRISH STORIES ALWAYS HAVE SAD ENDINGS. Narrator: THE FIGHTING KELLYS HAVE SPLINTERED INTO TWO CAMPS, AND CAPTAIN BRAD'S QUEST TO PROVIDE FOR HIS NEW FAMILY... SEASON'S ALMOST OVER, MAN. I'LL BE BACK IN HAWAII SOON. Narrator: MAY END UP COSTING HIM THE OLD ONE. AS FOR THE BIG, BAD POMRENKES... LET'S GO FIND SOME GOLD. LET'S GO FIND SOME INLAND GOLD. Narrator: AN INLAND MINING VENTURE IS ON THE HORIZON, AND THE FIRST-EVER 1,000-OUNCE SUMMER IS FINALLY WITHIN THEIR GRASP. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START GOING FOR POUNDS. UH, OUNCES IS, UH, TOO SMALL OF NUMBERS. Narrator: IN A FROSTY NOME HARBOR, DESPITE A 3-INCH SHEET OF ICE, FOR CAPTAIN HANK AND THE GOLD GRABBER... [ BEEPING ] OKAY, MATT. I'M READY TO PUSH OFF. ROGER THAT, BOSS. Narrator: HAVE BACKHOE...WILL TRAVEL. EROICA TO AU GRABBER. YOU COPY? OH, HELLO, MS. EROICA. HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS MORNING? WELL, OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE'RE LODGED IN A BLOCK OF ICE, I'M JUST DANDY. IT'S A FRESHWATER HARBOR. IT'S FREEZING OVER EVERY NIGHT, GETTING MORE SOLID EVERY DAY. OUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. YOU NEED A LITTLE ASSISTANCE OVER THERE? I CAN HELP BREAK SOME ICE FOR YOU, EMILY. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. UM, ARE YOU, UH, HEADING OUT SOMETIME SOON? YEAH, COME TO THE DOCK. I'M ON THE BUTTON ON STANDBY. I'LL FOLLOW YOU OUT. THANKS, HANK. GO AHEAD. WE'RE FROZEN OVER HERE AT THE, UH, WEST END OF THE SOUTH DOCK. SO, UH, IT'S GOT US BLOCKED OUT PRETTY GOOD. I'LL BE OVER THERE IN A MINUTE. OKAY. REAL GOOD. THANK YOU. MATT, GO AHEAD AND -- AND BREAK THE ICE OUT. ROGER THAT, BOSS. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Emily: THERE'S HANK. USING HIS OLD BUCKET TO BREAK UP SOME ICE FOR US. THANKS, HANK! THERE HE GOES. THERE YOU GO. HEY, WE'RE GONNA SWING THE BOAT AROUND AND, UH, JUST, UH, WE'LL GO UP TO BURN. THEN, I'LL BACK OUT OF IT, OKAY? ROGER THAT. OKAY, HANK. THAT'LL ABOUT DO IT, BUDDY. THANKS A LOT. OH, YEAH, BUDDY. I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO GET OUT. NOW, GO GET SOME GOLD. SOUNDS GOOD. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. GUESS IT'S TIME TO GO [BLEEP] GET SOME WORK DONE. WE MADE IT THROUGH THE ICE. TIME TO GO GET SOME GOLD. Narrator: WHILE HANK LEADS THE FLEET BREAKING ICE, 5 MILES TO THE NORTHEAST... I'M NOT GONNA SEE THOSE BAD YEARS AGAIN. I'M GONNA DO MY HOMEWORK. Narrator: POMRENKE FATHER AND SON ARE BREAKING GROUND. ARE YOU IN -- IN ON THE INLAND MINING, OR OUT? Narrator: AFTER A SUMMER OF NEGOTIATIONS... I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANY PART OF IT OR... YEAH. I DON'T WANNA JUST BE [BLEEP] LEFT BEHIND. Narrator: AND IN FIGHTING... THAT'S A NICE, HEAVY JAR. WE'LL JUST KEEP IN THE FAMILY. WE'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF FAMILY MEMBERS WE CAN KEEP IT IN, SO THAT'LL BE THE PLAN. Narrator: STEVE AND SHAWN ARE WORKING TOGETHER... WE GOT A NICE-LOOKING SPOT COMING UP HERE. Narrator: ...FOR THE FIRST OFFICIAL DIG OF THE NEW INLAND MINING VENTURE. WE'RE RIGHT BY WHEN WE WANNA LOOK FOR SOME GOLD. DAD'S GONNA DIG OUR FIRST HOLE. WHEN I DID INLAND MINING EARLIER IN MY CAREER, I WENT THROUGH A 3-YEAR STINT THERE WHERE WE LOST $400,000, $500,000, AND THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. LOT OF NICE ROCK. GOT THE RIGHT COLOR TO IT. YOU WANNA GET THE BUCKET AND GO, UH, GET A SAMPLE FROM THE SIDEWALL THERE? YEAH. [ RATTLING ] PERFECT. JUST LIKE THAT. SO WE GOT DIFFERENT LAYERS OF GRAVEL THERE, AND WE WANNA GET SAMPLES OF WHERE THE ONE LAYER OF GRAVEL MEETS THE OTHER DIFFERENT LAYER. THAT'S USUALLY WHERE THE GOLD GETS LAID OUT, AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT LAYER. WHEN YOU'RE GOUGING BUCKETS OF GRAVEL OFF THE OCEAN FLOOR, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT COMES OUT OF THAT -- THAT LAYER. BUT HERE, WE SPECIFICALLY HAVE OUR EYES ON IT. WE GOT OUR HANDS ON IT. WE'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT -- WHERE THIS GOLD IS COMING FROM. OKAY. GO AHEAD, GET ME OUT OF HERE. COMING UP. GOT A GOOD SAMPLE THERE? YEAH, LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ONE. THIS OUGHT TO BE THE GOOD SAMPLE, HUH? YEAH, THAT LOOKS LIKE GOOD STUFF THERE. NICE WASH CROCK. LET ME GET DOWN IN HERE. HERE WE GO. COME ON. COME ON. OH, WOW. THAT'S A HELL OF A NICE PAN. OH, BIG, COARSE GOLD. HELL OF A NICE PAN. HA HA. THAT'S GONNA TAKE US INLAND. YES, IT IS. [ ENGINE STARTS ] I'M EXCITED NOW. Narrator: WHILE THE POMRENKES ARE SETTING UP A GOLDEN EMPIRE, 5 MILES TO THE SOUTH... IT'S THE END OF THE SEASON. I GOT MY ASSISTANT, BOSTON DAVE. SURE HE ISN'T WORTH A [BLEEP], BUT HE STILL DOES -- HE TRIES HARD. Narrator: THE FLEET'S NEWEST CAPTAIN, KRIS KELLY, IS JUST LOOKING TO MAKE SOME GET-OUT-OF-TOWN CASH. MY BROTHER'S REAL [BLEEP] RIGHT NOW. HE'S REALLY GONNA HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY DAD AND COURTNEY, HIS NEW FAMILY AND ALL THAT CRAP. I'M GLAD I'M NOT WORKING OVER THERE ANYMORE, LET ME TELL YOU. Narrator: FOR KRIS... WORKING WITH HIS FAMILY ON THE REAPER WAS ONE ESCAPADE... NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS HOSE. STUPID GARBAGE. YOU CLEAN THAT... Narrator: AFTER ANOTHER... WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: UNTIL HE FINALLY BROKE FREE OF HIS FATHER... 10 GRAND BUYS YOU HALF THE LOKO. Narrator: BOUGHT INTO HIS OWN DREDGE. ALL RIGHT, BRO. ANOTHER GOOD INVESTMENT BY KRIS KELLY. MY DAD GOT A LOT OF FREE LABOR. HE GOT ALL OF HIS EQUIPMENT PAID FOR. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT ANYTHING INTO IT. IT'S MY OWN DAMN FAULT. I SHOULD'VE HAD MORE CONTROL OVER MY SITUATION, YOU KNOW, AND ME TRYING TO HELP MY DAD AND HELP MY MOM AND HELP MY, YOU KNOW, HELP EVERYBODY, HAS REALLY JUST COST ME ANOTHER SEASON. I'M DEPENDING ON YOU, BUDDY, TO GET DOWN THERE. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT. I GOT A LOT OF FAITH IN YOU. I GOT THIS, BRO. Narrator: NOW, KRIS' NEW PARTNER, BOSTON DAVE, IS HEADING TO THE BOTTOM, LOOKING TO SCORE THE PAIR A FINAL PAYDAY. YOU READY? ONE, TWO, THREE. [ BREATHING LOUDLY ] YEAH, I THINK I FOUND A SPOT. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BOAT, MAN. THAT'S NOT REALLY WHERE I WAS WORKING AT HERE. I SHOULD'VE WENT DOWN THERE FIRST MYSELF. I'M PUTTING A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH FAITH IN A REAL GREEN DIVER RIGHT NOW. DAVE CAME UP HERE ON VACATION, YOU KNOW, THINKING HE COULD BE A GOLD MINER. HE GETS ALL PUMPED UP SEEING ME GET REAL GOOD GOLD THAT HE THINKS HE CAN JUMP THERE AND DO IT, TOO. HEY, KRIS. YEAH? YOU WANTED TO KNOW IF I COULD FIND GOLD, HUH, BUDDY? HE FOUND SOMETHING. HE FOUND SOMETHING. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, BOY. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT THE [BLEEP]? YEAH, GOLD. [ BLEEP ] WHOO! THAT LUCKY [BLEEP] BASTARD. WOW. OH, YEAH, BABY. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, BUDDY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT? OH, I KNOW WHY WE'RE GETTING SO MUCH GOLD. I'M RIGHT WHERE THE COBBLE MEETS THE SAND, BUDDY. OH, YEAH. COME TO PAPA, BABY. THAT'S [BLEEP] AWESOME. Narrator: KRIS ISN'T THE ONLY KELLY WITH GOLD IN HAND. AS FOR HIS FORMER EMPLOYER... DO YOU LIKE THE REAPER? SEE? DO YOU LIKE, UH, THE LOKO? YOU DON'T? I DON'T, EITHER. [ CHILD LAUGHING ] THE LOKO SUCKS, DON'T IT? DOES THE LOKO SUCK? [ CHILD LAUGHING ] Narrator: KRIS' OLD MAN HAS A NEW MOUTH TO FEED AND IS CASHING OUT THE LAST OF THE SUMMER GOLD FROM THE REAPER. THAT'S WHAT'S BUYING YOUR NEW TOYS, RIGHT THERE. Narrator: AS FOR THE DIVER WHO ACTUALLY FOUND ALL THAT GOLD? THEY'RE DOING MY CLEANOUT OF THE GOLD. THEY WANTED TO DO IT IN THE HOUSE. I'M STILL NOT ALLOWED THERE, SO THEY'RE DOING IT NOW. SO I GET TO SIT HERE AND WATCH. Narrator: ANDY IS PERSONA NON GRATA IN THE NEW KELLY HOUSE. ANDY'S NOT GONNA BE HERE FOR THIS CLEANOUT. HE'S NOT ALLOWED IN THE HOUSE SINCE COURTNEY EXILED HIM OUT OF HERE. IS HE PEEKING OUT OF THE WINDOW? UH-HUH. HE IS? YOU WANT ME TO CLOSE THE, UH, CURTAIN? YEAH, WE DON'T WANT HIM LOOKING IN OUR BUSINESS OVER HERE. THIS IS FAMILY BUSINESS, SECOND FAMILY BUSINESS. WE DON'T WANT HIM SPOTTING ANY GOLD OVER HERE. I TOLD HIM THAT OUR CLEANOUT WASN'T GONNA BE THAT GOOD. WELCOME. ALL RIGHT. OUR LITTLE HUMBLE ABODE. HEY, THAT'S A NICE LITTLE CLEANUP YOU GOT THERE. IT'S MY BEST CLEANOUT EVER. SINCE I HAD THE BABY, I'M TELLING YOU, MY LUCK HAS CHANGED, COURT. OKAY. HERE -- HERE WE GO. TWO... IF ANDY KNEW THIS, HE'D KILL ME, DUDE. 9.5. 14.8... 17.89. 24.1, 8-1-9. IT KEEPS ON FLOPPING BACK AND FORTH. LIKE I SAY, I DON'T THINK THIS HOUSE IS QUITE LEVEL. NO, IT'S NOT. Narrator: THE TOTAL? 24.18 OUNCES, WORTH 29 GRAND. WHOA. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THANKS, BILL. Narrator: AS LEAD DIVER, ANDY'S 50% SHARE COMES TO 12 OUNCES... YOUR RICHES! Narrator: WHICH HIS FATHER WILL, OF COURSE, PAY HIM IN FULL. [BLEEP] ANDY, GREEDY [BLEEP]. HE DOESN'T NEED THIS MUCH MONEY. HE'S GONNA GIVE IT TO HIS MOTHER. SO? WELL, THE CLEANOUT WAS ALL RIGHT. IT WASN'T THAT GREAT, BUT IT COULD BE WORSE. YOU'RE GETTING A RECORD CLEANOUT YOURSELF. IT'S ME, YOUR GOLD-BEARING FATHER, WITH YOUR RICHES AND REWARD. YOU WANNA LOOK AT IT FIRST? YEAH. HAND ME THE WHOLE THING. WELL, ANYWAYS, IT WAS A GOOD SEASON. I HOPE YOU COME BACK. DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT MUCH. IT'S 3.5 OUNCES IN THERE. Narrator: BRAD'S "NOW YOU SEE IT, NOW YOU DON'T" ROUTINE JUST COST ANDY 10 GRAND. THAT WAS 50%, BUDDY. I ONLY DID 7 OUNCES THIS LAST 2 WEEKS OF CLEANOUT, SO IT WASN'T THAT GOOD OF A GOLD RUN. BULL[BLEEP]. THERE WAS ONLY 7 OUNCES IN THERE. LOOK, I SWEAR ON YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE. THERE'S ONLY 7 -- OH, HEY. HOW ABOUT THIS? SWEAR ON YOURS, YOUR NEW BABY AND COURTNEY'S LIFE? SWEAR ON THAT. FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING. SO, YOU ROBBED ME? GIVE ME MY [BLEEP] GOLD. GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF MY ROOM. TAKE IT. DOUCHEBAG. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE. YOU GOT IT. THERE'S JUST NO WAY I GOT THAT LITTLE BIT OF GOLD. YEAH. YOU RIP ME OFF, YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Narrator: JUST OFF THE COAST OF NOME, OUT ON CLAIM 14... HEY, HEY. HOW'S IT GOING DOWN THERE? Narrator: CAPTAIN EMILY RIEDEL AND HER NEW ACE DIVER, DARYL GALIPEAU, ARE IN THE FINAL LAP. IT'S THE 11th HOUR OF OUR MINING SEASON. I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE'RE ENDING THIS SEASON STRONG. I WISH THAT WE WERE, UH, AT 300 OUNCES, BUT THINGS CHANGED ON THE BOAT LATE, AND THEY CHANGED FOR THE BETTER, AND THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE. Narrator: THIS SUMMER... WAIT, YOU GUYS ARE BOTH LEAVING? I'M NOT GONNA WORK FOR FREE. Narrator: FOR THE SECOND SEASON IN A ROW, EMILY WAS DITCHED BY HER CREW. 21, 22... Narrator: AND FOR THE SECOND SEASON IN A ROW... 22.9. [BLEEP] YEAH. Narrator: SHE'S MANAGING TO PULL OFF A COMEBACK. I -- I'M NOT ONLY A WOMAN, BUT I'M A WOMAN IN A MAN'S WORLD, TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL. AND I WANNA GET THINGS DONE. I WANNA MAKE MONEY. I WANNA MAKE A LOT OF GOLD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEIR BETRAYAL RESULTED, ULTIMATELY, IN THE SUCCESS OF MY OPERATION. Narrator: AFTER THE MUTINY, THE SKIPPER IS PUSHING FOR A MINIMUM 150-OUNCE FINAL TALLY, BUT TO GET THERE... HOW'S THE WATER TEMPERATURE DOWN THERE? YOUR FEET STILL GETTING COLD? WELL, THEY'RE NOT NUMB. SO THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. Narrator: HER DIVER WILL HAVE TO BATTLE THE ELEMENTS. I MEAN, TRY TO STAY AS WARM AS YOU CAN DOWN THERE. LET'S GET IN A COUPLE MORE HOURS BEFORE WE HAVE TO CALL IT AND TAKE THE BOAT HOME. ROGER THAT. I JUST PULLED A ROCK, AND THERE WAS JUST A CLUSTER OF GOLD THERE. [ CHUCKLES ] ALL RIGHT. AWESOME. I'M PROUD OF, UH, MY -- MY ONE CREW MEMBER. DARYL'S REALLY STUCK IT OUT. HE'S REALLY MOTIVATED TO STAY ON THE GOLD AND TO KEEP MINING. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, IT'S, UM, THE END IS HERE. IT'S -- IT'S GETTING DANGEROUSLY COLD FOR THE DIVER. WE'RE NOT REALLY EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THESE KINDS OF TEMPERATURES FOR SUMMERTIME MINING. I'D LOVE TO HAVE A GOOD DAY OUT HERE TODAY. Narrator: 8 MILES TO THE WEST, ON THE TOMCOD CLAIM... WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME HERE. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. SEASON'S SHORT. Narrator: WILD RANGER OWNER VERNON ADKISON IS LOOKING FOR ONE MORE SHOT AT THE GOLD. WE GOTTA GET AFTER IT, AND STAY AFTER IT, EVERY DAMN MINUTE. Narrator: WITH 159 OUNCES, WORTH 190K BANKED SO FAR, THE SKIPPER IS GIVING DIVER LUCAS WOLF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LAST TURN ON THE NOZZLE. IT'S CHILLY. I'M NERVOUS. MY FEET ARE ALREADY COLD, BUT I SIGNED UP FOR IT. Vernon: WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOT THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS IN THIS BUSINESS. THIS GOLD BUSINESS, UH, PRETTY DAMN STRESSFUL. Narrator: THIS SUMMER, VERNON'S STRESSFUL BUSINESS HAS HAD MORE TO DO WITH HIS FAMILY THAN GOLD. ELAINE, YOU -- YOU DON'T JUST SIT AROUND AND -- AND PLAY MUGWUMPS WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND AND WHATNOT. Narrator: WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH HIS DAUGHTER ELAINE AND HER BOYFRIEND... GET OFF THE FREAKING BOAT. I'M SICK OF YOUR [BLEEP]. Narrator: PROVED TO BE MORE THAN HE COULD HANDLE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE GOES WOLF. [ HOWLING ] Narrator: NOW VERN AND HIS DAUGHTER HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN OVER A MONTH. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE QUIT OR GOT FIRED. I THINK IT WAS, LIKE, MUTUAL AGREEMENT. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. BUT SHE IS MY DAUGHTER, AND I LOVE HER, AND I WANNA HAVE CONTACT WITH HER. I DON'T LIKE IT, BUT I GOTTA SUCK IT UP AND DEAL WITH IT. REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FAMILY HERE IN ALASKA. IT'S BASICALLY JUST MY MOM AND DAD UP HERE. UM, SO TO LOSE HIM AS PART OF MY SUPPORT NETWORK IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL. Narrator: AS FOR VERNON'S LITTLE GIRL, ELAINE IS LOOKING TO MAKE PEACE FOR ONE BIG REASON. SHEM AND I FOUND OUT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER. IT WAS DEFINITELY, UH, UNEXPECTED. IT WAS NOT PLANNED. SO I HAVE A FEELING DAD'S GONNA BE CRITICAL OF ME. HE'S VERY OLD-FASHIONED WHEN IT COMES TO RELATIONSHIPS, SO HE DEFINITELY DOESN'T APPROVE OF CHILDREN OUT OF WEDLOCK. BUT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I'M HOPING FOR THE BEST, BUT I'M DEFINITELY PREPARED FOR THE WORST. WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE, MAN? I MEAN, I'M NOT SEEING ANY MATERIAL COMING THROUGH THE BOX, SO YOU DOWN THERE PULLING YOUR PUD OR CHASING STARFISH, OR WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? OVER. USE YOUR WOLF NOSE AND SNIFF IT OUT. [ SNIFFING ] THE MATERIAL'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN LAST TIME, BUT, UM, I THINK IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SPOT. GET DOWN THERE AND HOG THAT MATERIAL. GET INTO IT. I WANNA SEE YOU PUT SOMETHING THROUGH THE BOX HERE. [ HOWLING ] Narrator: WHILE WOLF TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS, BACK ON BELMONT BEACH... ANDY KELLY HAS SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS WITH HIS POPS. AH, HE SCREWED ME OVER ON MONEY AND GOLD. HE SCREWED MY FAMILY OVER. UH, HE COMMITTED ADULTERY. AND NOW I HAVE A STEPSISTER, APPARENTLY. PAYBACK'S A BITCH. TIME TO PLAY. THAT'S MY DAD'S INCOME... AND I JUST ENDED HIS SEASON. Narrator: 7 MILES WEST OF NOME HARBOR... WE'RE SEPARATING THE MEN FROM THE BOYS RIGHT NOW. Narrator: AFTER HELPING HIS OLD MAN FIND GOLD ON LAND, SHAWN POMRENKE IS READY FOR ONE LAST FIGHT WITH THE BERING SEA. SEE, THIS WHOLE AREA'S ALL BEEN MINED OUT. IT'S STARTING TO BE A BUNCH OF CRAP. ALL THESE GUYS ARE COMING OUT HERE, JUMPING ON WHERE I'VE BEEN MINING AND THEN SAYING I'M JUMPING THEM. THEY KNOW IT'S A LOT OF CROCK OF [BLEEP]. Narrator: LAST WEEK... THIS IS WHAT THE ASS GRABBER'S GOOD FOR -- A LITTLE PUSH. Narrator: SHAWN AND THE CHRISTINE ROSE HELPED TURN THE TOMCOD INTO AN ALL-OUT BATTLE ROYALE. [BLEEP] RUN ME OFF MY CLAIM! [ BLEEP ] [BLEEP] WRONG! NO [BLEEP] COMMENT ON THAT ONE. Narrator: NOW THERE'S NO TIME LEFT TO FIGHT, ONLY ENOUGH TO GET AS MUCH GOLD AS YOU CAN. THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A TEST PAN RIGHT HERE, SEE WHAT WE GOT. I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE THERE. COME ON, GOLD. SHOW ME THAT SEXY ASS. AH, LET'S SEE WHAT THE TEST PAN BRINGS US. THAT'S SOME GOOD DAMN GOLD RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A SEASON ENDER. LET'S FIRE IT UP! [ ENGINE STARTS ] MIGHT BE BURNED OUT, BUT AFTER YOU SEE A PAN LIKE THAT, IT KINDA GETS YOUR BLOOD PUMPING. A PAN LIKE THAT, YOU COULD DO 100 OUNCES IN PROBABLY TWO, THREE DAYS. WHOA, WHAT A WAY TO END THE YEAR. IT MIGHT BE COLD, BUT WE'RE GONNA GET SOME MORE GOLD. Narrator: WHILE SHAWN IS RAKING IT IN... HEY, SHAWN. YOU GOT THE RADIO ON? THIS IS, UH, AU GRABBER. HEY, LOOK. IT'S HANK. Narrator: JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY... IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT HERE ON THE BERING SEA. I'M GLAD HE FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHERE HE'S AT. Narrator: AFTER COMING OUT ON TOP IN THE BATTLE FOR TOMCOD HANK IS LETTING BYGONES BE BYGONES. I MADE A COMMITMENT TO MYSELF THIS MORNING. I'M GONNA TRY TO HIT -- HIT AS HARD AS I CAN, BUT TIME'S TICKING. YEAH, I GOT SOMETHING TO PROVE TO MYSELF. WE'RE RIGHT APPROACHING 500 OUNCES. DO A LITTLE TEST PAN HERE PRETTY QUICK. OH, YEAH. YOU CAN SEE THE GOLD IN THERE, JUST LAYING ON THERE. WE'RE IN THE GOLD, MATT! I GOTTA DIG ALL THE GOLD I CAN RIGHT NOW. BUT I HAVE A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF NOW THAN I DID WHEN I STARTED LAST YEAR. I BELONG IN THIS BUSINESS. I'M A 2-YEAR VETERAN NOW. GOT A FULL TANK OF FUEL, SO WE'RE GONNA KEEP MINING UNTIL WE EITHER RUN OUT OF FUEL OR THE WEATHER CHASES US OFF. Narrator: WHILE THE TWO MEGA-DREDGES GET IN THEIR LAST LICKS, 7 MILES TO THE EAST, BACK IN THE CITY OF NOME... AT EMILY RIEDEL'S APARTMENT... YEAH, THIS IS THE FINAL CLEANOUT OF THE SEASON. WE'RE REALLY HOPING TO MAKE 25 OUNCES. THIS IS, UH, LOOKING GOOD. Narrator: JUST 25 OUNCES AWAY FROM A PROFIT, EMILY AND DARYL ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT IF THEY SALVAGED THEIR SEASON. 150 WAS KINDA THE SEASON GOAL, SO WE'RE HOPING FOR THAT. BUT I DON'T KNOW. [ BLEEP ] THIS IS INTENSE. OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: FIRST UP... SO WE'RE WEIGHING THE TOP OF THE BOX FIRST. AND THEN, WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW WITH THE REST OF IT. Narrator: THE GOLD FROM THE FRONT SECTION OF THE EROICA SLUICE BOX. 8, 9, 11... OH, WE -- ACTUALLY, WE GOT A SHOT AT -- AT 25 NOW. HOW MUCH WOULD -- HOW MUCH DO -- DO WE NEED TO MAKE 25? 11.55. COME ON, 11.55. Narrator: THE LAST CHANCE IS THE GOLD FROM THE BACK OF THE BOX. ALL RIGHT, WE GOT 5, 6... NOT LOOKING BAD. 9... COME ON, 10. [ LAUGHS ] 11.9. [ POT CLATTERS ] WHOO! [ LAUGHS ] 150 RIGHT THERE. 150! Narrator: A 150-OUNCE SUMMER IS WORTH 180,000 BUCKS, ENOUGH TO PUT EMILY SQUARELY IN THE BLACK. THIS IS THE BEST MY BOAT'S DONE ALL YEAR. WITH THE WAY THAT THE SEASON WENT AND THE WAY THAT IT TURNED AROUND, ENDING UP WITH 150 OUNCES, IT'S [BLEEP] AWESOME. BETTER THAN A KICK IN THE ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] I REALIZE NOW THAT I'M -- I'M GONNA SURVIVE UP HERE. IN THIS JOB, I NEED TO BE BUSINESS. I NEED TO FORFEIT THE NOTION OF LOYALTY, OF FAMILY. I NEED TO BE CONSTANTLY HIRING THE BEST OF THE BEST REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE AS PEOPLE. WE DIDN'T FAIL, BUT WE DIDN'T SUCCEED WILDLY EITHER, AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO JUST SUCCEED WILDLY FOR THE REST OF THE TIME THAT I'M UP HERE. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? WILD SUCCESS. Narrator: AS A NEW DAY DAWNS IN NOME... THE BOAT'S HAD IT. THE WEATHER'S HAD IT. YOU KNOW, WE'RE DONE. Narrator: FOR MOST OF THE FLEET... WE'RE PULLING THE BOAT OUT TODAY. Narrator: THE 2014 MINING SEASON... WE JUST WANT IT TO GET DONE. IT'S TIME TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Narrator: ...IS OFFICIALLY A WRAP. THAT IS, FOR EVERYBODY BUT ONE. HOLY [BLEEP], IS IT COLD. TRYING TO PILE UP AS MUCH GOLD AS WE CAN HERE BEFORE IT'S DONE AND OVER. Narrator: SHAWN POMRENKE ISN'T ABOUT TO CRY "UNCLE." IN HIS SIGHTS, THE FIRST-EVER 1,000 OUNCE SEASON. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES OUT HERE. THERE AIN'T ANOTHER DREDGE. YOU CAN'T SEE ANOTHER DREDGE FOR MILES. JUST A WEEK AGO, THERE WAS 20 OF 'EM OUT HERE. AND I'M JUST GONNA PUSH THROUGH IT. YEAH, I'M TIRED. YEAH, I WANNA QUIT, TOO, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO. I WANNA GET 1,000 OUNCES, AND I AIN'T GONNA LET ANYTHING STOP ME FROM GETTING IT. Narrator: IN THE CITY OF NOME... WE NEED A HUGE CLEANUP RIGHT NOW. A LOT'S RIDING ON THIS ONE. Narrator: AFTER THREE MONTHS OF WORK... LOOK AT ALL THE CHUNKY [BLEEP] IN THERE, THOUGH, DUDE. Narrator: FINAL CLEANUPS ARE UNDERWAY. YEAH, THERE'S GOLD CLEAR 'ROUND HERE. BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. WE'RE IN GOLD. Narrator: FOR A WEARY GOLD-DREDGING FLEET... LET'S STOP IT AND TAKE A LOOK. Narrator: IT'S TIME TO REAP THE LAST REWARDS. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. A HUNDRED TONS OF GOLD. I MEAN, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO EXPECT? Narrator: AT THE LOCAL CLEANUP SHACK... RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOT A LITTLE BARBECUE GOLD ACTION. Narrator: CAPTAIN KRIS KELLY IS GRILLING UP HIS LAST PAYDAY OF THE YEAR. [ WHISTLES ] COUPLE MORE MINUTES AND WE'LL FIND OUT REALLY WHAT WE HAVE. THAT'S A BIG FREAKING PILE OF GOLD. MOMENT OF TRUTH, BRO. PLEASE DON'T SPILL ANY. WE'RE ALREADY AT 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11... 17.93. ALMOST 18 OUNCES. THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME. ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF AN OUNCE AN HOUR. WOW, MAN. LET'S JUST, UH... ME AND YOU JUST MADE $18,000. Narrator: ACTUALLY, BOSTON DAVE, IT'S A WICKED GOOD $21,500. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THE ICE OPERATION IS FUNDED, DUDE. THIS WINTER WILL BE AWESOME. Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN... ALL RIGHT, GUYS. THIS IS THE LAST GO-DOWN. Narrator: VERNON'S FINAL HAUL IS ALSO HITTING THE SCALE. OKAY, THERE'S 10 OUNCES, 12, 13, 14... 17, 18, 19...

GOOD JOB, GUYS. Narrator: 30.86 OUNCES GIVES VERNON A SEASON TOTAL OF 189 OUNCES, WORTH $226,000. I'LL TELL YA, I'M QUITE PROUD OF THIS CREW. WELL, HIGH FIVES, EVERYONE. ALL RIGHT. THANKS, YVONNE. YEP. IT WAS A DAMN GOOD SEASON. I WAS ORIGINALLY SHOOTING FOR 700 OUNCES. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. BUT THE FACT THAT MY TEAM HAS COME IN AT THE TOP OF THE GOLD COUNT FOR SUCTION DREDGES, YEAH, THAT'S GRATIFYING. Narrator: OVER AT THE SCHIMSCHAT GOLD SHACK... END OF YEAR. ZERO OUT. 29.93. 86...

YEAH. WHOO! [BLEEP] LOVE IT, MAN. I STILL FEEL THAT I-I SUCCEEDED. IF I COULD DO JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN WHAT I DID THIS YEAR, THE PLAN IS TO KEEP MINING. I'M GONNA SET OUR NEW GOAL NEXT YEAR. IT MAY INCLUDE BEATING SHAWN. I DON'T KNOW YET. I GOTTA THINK ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: SPEAKING OF SHAWN... GOLD! Narrator: MR. GOLD AND THE CHRISTINE ROSE ARE THE LAST DREDGE STANDING. END OF THE SEASON. I'M GETTING BURNED OUT. TIRED OF 16-HOUR DAYS 7 DAYS A WEEK. THIS IS THE RUN THAT WE BREAK 1,000, FINALLY MEET THE -- OUR GOAL OF 1,000 OUNCES. IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE'VE HAD THE CHRISTINE ROSE OUT THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE OUR GOAL. WAVES ARE GETTING BIG. IT'S GOING MORE, LIKE, NORTHWEST 20 TO 30. WHEW, TIME TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. GONNA BE A SNOWSTORM. Narrator: AFTER PUSHING IT TO THE LIMIT... OUT OF TIME. THIS SEASON'S OVER. Narrator: SHAWN FINALLY PACKS IT IN. I'M DONE. TIME TO CHECK THE BOX. LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. I SEE QUITE A FEW... DEFINITELY THE MOST GOLD I'VE EVER SEEN. WHAT A HELL OF A YEAR. LAST RUN OF THE SEASON. OOH. HANDFUL OF NUGGETS, BOX FULL OF GOLD. I THINK DAD'S GONNA BE HAPPY. Narrator: ON A NEWLY FROZEN BELMONT BEACH... IT GOT REAL COLD LAST NIGHT, FROZE UP THE RIVER REAL GOOD. Narrator: ZEKE TENHOFF AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, SARAH DUNN, ARE CALLING IT A SUMMER. WELL, THIS SUMMER, I MADE ABOUT, YEAH, $65,000. I BEAT MY PERSONAL RECORD, PULLED IT UP TO ABOUT 55, 56 OUNCES. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO DON'T MAKE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT KIND OF MONEY, AND I'VE BEEN -- I WAS WORKING FOR MYSELF THE WHOLE TIME.
